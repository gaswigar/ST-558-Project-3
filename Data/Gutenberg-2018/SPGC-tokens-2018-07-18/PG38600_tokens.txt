and

of

the

and

of

ascent
toward
the
temple
of
knowledge
truth
has
made
its
ingress
into
the
human
mind
in
the
ratio
by
which
man
has
attained
the
capacity
to
receive
and
appreciate
it
hence
as
we
tread
back
the
meandering
pathway
of
human
history
every
step
in
the
receding
process
brings
us
to
a
lower
plane
of
intelligence
and
a
state
of
mind
more
thoroughly
encrusted
with
ignorance
and
superstition
it
is
therefore
no
source
of
surprise
to
learn
when
we
take
a
survey
of
the
world
two
or
three
thousand
years
in
the
past
that
every
religious
writer
of
that
era
committed
errors
on
every
subject
which
employed
his
pen
involving
a
scientific
principle
hence
the
bible
or
sacred
book
to
which
he
was
a
contributor
is
now
found
to
bear
the
marks
of
human
imperfection
for
the
temple
of
knowledge
was
but
partially
reared
and
its
chambers
but
dimly
lighted
up
the
intellectual
brain
was
in
a
dark
feeble
and
dormant
condition
hence
the
moral
and
religious
feelings
were
drifted
about
without
a
pilot
on
the
turbulent
waves
of
superstition
and
finally
stranded
on
the
shoals
of
bigotry
the
christian
bible
like
other
bibles
having
been
written
in
an
age
when
science
was
but
budding
into
life
and
philosophy
had
attained
but
a
feeble
growth
should
be
expected
to
teach
many
things
incompatible
with
the
principles
of
modern
science
and
accordingly
it
is
found
to
contain
like
other
bibles
numerous
statements
so
obviously
at
war
with
present
established
scientific
truths
that
almost
any
at
the
present
day
can
demonstrate
their
falsity
let
the
unbiased
reader
examine
and
compare
the
oriental
and
christian
bibles
together
and
he
will
note
the
following
facts
viz
that
the
cardinal
religious
conceptions
of
all
bibles
are
essentially
the
same
all
running
in
parable
grooves
that
every
chapter
of
every
bible
is
but
a
transcript
of
the
mental
chart
of
the
writer
that
no
bible
pagan
or
christian
contains
anything
surpassing
the
natural
mental
and
moral
capacity
of
the
writer
to
originate
and
hence
no
divine
aid
or
inspiration
was
necessary
for
its
production
that
the
moral
and
religious
teachings
of
no
bible
reach
a
higher
altitude
than
the
intelligence
and
mental
development
of
the
age
and
country
which
produced
it
that
the
christian
bible
in
some
respects
is
superior
to
some
of
the
other
bibles
but
only
to
the
extent
to
which
the
age
in
which
it
was
written
was
superior
in
intelligence
and
natural
mental
capacity
to
the
era
in
which
the
older
bibles
were
penned
and
that
this
superiority
consists
not
its
more
exalted
religious
conceptions
but
only
in
the
fact
that
being
of
more
modern
origin
the
progress
of
mind
had
worn
away
some
of
the
legendary
rubbish
of
the
past
being
written
in
a
later
and
more
enlightened
age
it
is
consequently
a
little
less
encrusted
with
mythological
tradition
and
oriental
imagery
though
not
free
from
these
elements
it
possesses
them
in
less
degree
and
by
comparing
christ
history
with
those
of
the
oriental
gods
it
will
be
found
that
he
taught
no
new
doctrine
or
moral
precept
that
he
inculcated
the
same
religion
and
morality
which
he
elaborated
as
other
moral
teachers
to
great
extremes
that
christ
differs
so
little
in
his
character
preaching
and
practical
life
from
some
of
the
oriental
gods
that
no
person
whose
mind
is
not
deplorably
warped
and
biased
by
early
training
can
call
one
divine
while
he
considers
the
other
human
that
if
christ
was
a
god
then
all
were
gods
the
author
preface
to
the
second
edition
the
author
desires
to
say
that
this
work
has
been
carefully
reviewed
and
corrected
and
some
additions
made
embracing
two
chapters
from
the
bible
of
bibles
and
some
explanatory
notes
and
is
now
able
to
place
before
the
reader
a
greatly
improved
edition
the
author
also
desires
to
say
here
that
the
many
flattering
letters
he
has
received
from
various
parts
of
the
country
from
those
who
have
supplied
themselves
with
the
work
excites
in
his
mind
the
hope
it
will
ultimately
effect
something
towards
achieving
the
important
end
sought
to
be
attained
by
its
publication
the
banishment
of
that
delusion
comprehended
in
the
belief
in
an
incarnate
god
called
jesus
christ
and
the
infallibility
of
his
teachings
with
the
numerous
evils
growing
legitimately
out
of
this
belief
among
the
most
important
of
which
is
its
cramping
effect
upon
the
mind
of
the
possessor
which
interdicts
its
growth
and
thus
constitutes
a
serious
obstacle
to
the
progress
both
of
the
individual
and
of
society
and
such
has
been
the
blinding
effect
of
this
delusion
upon
all
who
have
fallen
victims
to
its
influence
that
the
numerous
errors
and
evils
of
our
popular
system
of
religious
faith
which
constitutes
its
legitimate
fruits
have
passed
from
age
to
age
unnoticed
by
all
except
scientific
and
progressive
minds
who
are
constantly
bringing
these
errors
and
evils
to
light
this
state
of
things
has
been
a
source
of
sorrow
and
regret
to
every
philanthropist
desiring
the
welfare
of
the
race
and
if
this
work
shall
achieve
anything
towards
arresting
this
great
evil
the
author
will
feel
that
he
is
amply
compensated
for
the
years
of
toil
and
mental
labor
spent
in
its
preparation
as
the
different
works
consulted
have
assigned
different
dates
for
the
same
event
the
author
has
in
one
or
two
cases
followed
their
example
accepting
them
as
authority
as
in
the
date
of
the
birth
and
death
of
the
gods
of
mexico
the
reader
will
also
notice
that
the
name
of
the
same
god
is
found
in
different
countries
example
adonis
and
bacchus
are
found
amongst
the
gods
of
both
greece
and
egypt

what
an
imposing
title
for
a
book
what
startling
developments
of
religious
history
it
implies
is
it
founded
on
fact
or
on
fiction
if
it
has
a
basis
of
truth
where
was
such
an
extraordinary
mine
of
sacred
lore
discovered
where
were
such
startling
facts
obtained
as
the
title
of
the
work
suggests
these
queries
will
doubtless
arise
as
soliloquies
in
the
minds
of
many
readers
on
glancing
at
the
and
the
author
is
disposed
to
gratify
this
natural
and
most
probable
in
some
cases
excited
curiosity
by
a
brief
explanation
in
doing
this
he
deems
it
only
necessary
to
state
that
many
of
the
most
important
facts
collated
in
this
work
were
derived
from
sir
godfrey
higgins
anacalypsis
a
work
as
valuable
as
it
is
rare
a
work
comprising
the
result
of
twenty
years
labor
devoted
to
the
investigation
of
religious
history
and
although
embodying
many
important
historical
facts
which
should
have
commanded
for
it
a
circulation
but
a
few
copies
of
this
invaluable
treasury
of
religious
knowledge
have
ever
found
their
way
into
this
country
one
of
these
copies
the
author
of
this
work
obtained
at
no
inconsiderable
expense
long
enough
to
glean
from
its
pages
such
facts
as
he
presumed
would
be
most
interesting
and
instructive
to
the
general
reader
some
of
which
will
be
found
in
nearly
every
chapter
of
this
volume
with
the
facts
and
materials
derived
from
this
source
and
two
hundred
other
unimpeachable
historical
records
the
present
work
might
have
been
swelled
to
fourfold
its
present
size
without
exhausting
the
ample
store
of
materials
and
would
have
possessed
such
unwieldy
dimensions
but
for
a
strict
conformity
to
the
most
rigid
rules
of
eclecticism
and
condensation
encouraged
by
the
extensive
demand
for
his
former
work
the
biography
of
satan
which
has
passed
through
seven
editions
the
author
cherishes
the
hope
that
the
present
work
will
meet
with
a
circulation
commensurate
with
the
importance
of
the
many
invaluable
facts
which
it
contains
for
he
possesses
the
sad
conviction
that
the
many
religious
errors
and
evils
which
it
is
the
object
of
this
work
to
expose
operate
very
seriously
to
retard
the
moral
and
intellectual
growth
and
prosperity
of
all
christian
countries
they
have
the
effect
to
injure
mentally
morally
and
religiously
the
great
body
of
christian
professors
dr
prince
of
long
island
now
deceased
wrote
to
the
author
respecting
the
chapter
of
this
work
entitled
the
logical
view
of
the
incarnation
after
he
had
seen
it
in
the
columns
of
a
newspaper
it
is
a
masterly
piece
of
logic
and
will
startle
if
it
does
not
revolutionize
the
orthodox
world
and
the
chapters
comprising
philosophical
view
and
physiological
view
were
afterward
pronounced
specimens
of
profound
and
unanswerable
logical
reasoning
we
thus
call
the
reader
attention
to
these
chapters
in
advance
in
order
to
induce
that
thorough
attention
to
their
facts
and
arguments
which
will
result
in
banishing
from
his
mind
the
last
vestiges
of
a
belief
if
he
entertain
any
in
the
doctrine
of
the
divine
incarnation
important
facts
constituting
the
basis
of
this
work
ignorance
of
science
and
ignorance
of
history
are
the
two
great
bulwarks
of
religious
error
there
is
scarcely
a
tenet
of
religious
faith
now
propagated
to
the
world
by
the
professed
disciples
of
christ
but
that
if
subjected
to
a
rigid
test
in
the
ordeal
of
modern
science
would
be
found
to
contain
more
or
less
error
vast
acquisitions
have
been
made
in
the
fields
of
science
and
history
within
the
last
half
century
the
moral
lessons
of
which
have
done
much
to
undermine
and
unsettle
our
popular
system
of
religious
faith
and
to
bring
into
disrepute
or
effectually
change
many
of
its
dogmas
the
scientific
and
historical
facts
thus
brought
before
the
intelligent
public
have
served
as
keys
for
explaining
many
of
the
doctrines
comprised
in
the
popular
creed
they
have
poured
a
flood
of
light
upon
our
whole
system
of
religion
as
now
taught
by
its
popular
representatives
which
have
had
the
effect
to
reveal
many
of
its
errors
to
those
who
have
had
the
temerity
or
the
curiosity
to
investigate
it
upon
these
grounds
many
of
the
doctrines
and
miraculous
events
which
have
always
been
assigned
a
divine
emanation
by
the
disciples
of
the
christian
faith
are
by
these
scientific
and
historical
disclosures
shown
to
be
explainable
upon
natural
grounds
and
to
have
exclusively
a
natural
basis
some
of
them
are
shown
to
be
solvable
by
recently
developed
spiritual
laws
while
others
are
proven
to
be
founded
wholly
in
error
the
intelligent
community
are
now
acquainted
with
many
of
these
important
facts
so
that
no
man
of
science
can
be
found
in
this
enlightened
age
who
can
popularly
be
termed
a
christian
no
man
can
be
found
in
any
christian
country
who
has
the
established
reputation
of
being
a
man
of
science
or
who
has
made
any
proficiency
in
the
whole
curriculum
of
the
sciences
whose
creed
when
examined
by
an
orthodox
committee
would
not
be
pronounced
unsound
it
is
true
that
many
of
the
scientific
class
not
possessing
the
conviction
that
duty
imposes
the
moral
necessity
of
making
living
martyrs
of
themselves
have
refrained
from
fully
avowing
or
disclosing
to
the
public
their
real
convictions
of
the
popular
faith
the
changes
and
improvements
in
religious
ideas
now
observant
in
the
most
intelligent
portion
of
the
community
are
due
in
part
to
the
rapid
progress
of
scientific
discovery
and
the
dissemination
of
scientific
knowledge
in
christian
countries
the
explorer
in
the
field
of
religious
history
however
comes
in
here
for
his
meed
of
praise
new
stores
of
historic
facts
and
data
may
be
reckoned
among
the
recent
acquisitions
of
the
laborious
archeologist
new
fountains
of
religious
history
have
recently
been
unsealed
which
have
had
the
effect
to
reveal
many
errors
and
false
claims
set
up
for
the
current
religion
of
christendom
a
religion
long
regarded
as
settled
and
stereotyped
for
many
centuries
subsequent
to
the
establishment
of
the
christian
religion
but
little
was
known
by
its
disciples
of
the
character
claims
and
doctrines
of
the
oriental
systems
of
worship
these
religions
in
fact
were
scarcely
known
to
exist
because
they
had
long
been
veiled
in
secrecy
they
were
found
in
some
cases
enshrined
in
religious
books
printed
or
written
in
a
language
so
very
ancient
and
obscure
as
to
bid
defiance
for
centuries
to
the
labors
of
the
most
indefatigable
profound
and
erudite
archeological
scholar
to
decipher
it
that
obstacle
is
now
partially
surmounted
the
recent
translation
for
the
first
time
of
the
hindoo
vedas
into
the
english
language
the
oldest
bible
now
extant
or
ever
written
has
revealed
to
the
unwelcome
gaze
of
the
christian
reader
the
startling
fact
that
the
heathen
had
long
been
in
possession
of
holy
books
possessing
essentially
the
same
character
and
teaching
essentially
the
same
doctrines
as
the
christian
bible
there
being
as
horace
greeley
expressed
it
no
doctrine
of
christianity
but
what
has
been
anticipated
by
the
vedas
see
vol
chap
i
of
this
work
if
then
this
heathen
bible
compiled
according
to
the
christian
missionary
rev
g
allen
contains
all
the
doctrines
of
christianity
then
away
goes
over
the
dam
all
claim
for
the
christian
bible
as
an
original
bible
as
an
original
revelation
or
a
work
of
divine
inspiration
bibles
are
thus
shown
to
be
of
heathen
and
human
origin
instead
of
heavenly
and
divine
authorship
as
claimed
for
them
by
their
respective
disciples
the
christian
bible
forming
no
exception
to
this
statement
the
latter
being
essentially
like
other
bibles
it
must
of
course
have
had
the
same
or
a
similar
origin
a
fact
which
though
it
may
be
new
and
startling
to
millions
will
be
universally
accepted
as
truth
before
the
lapse
of
many
generations
and
a
fact
which
confronts
with
open
denial
the
claims
of
two
hundred
millions
of
christian
professors
who
assert
with
unscrupulous
boldness
that
every
doctrine
principle
and
precept
of
their
bible
is
of
divine
emanation
how
utterly
groundless
and
untenable
is
such
a
claim
when
arranged
by
the
side
of
modern
discoveries
in
religious
history
equally
unsupportable
is
the
declaration
that
there
is
no
other
name
given
under
heaven
whereby
men
can
be
saved
than
that
of
jesus
christ
and
him
crucified
when
viewed
in
the
light
of
the
modern
explorations
of
sir
godfrey
higgins
which
have
disclosed
the
history
of
nearly
a
score
of
crucified
gods
and
saviors
who
we
have
equal
proof
died
for
the
sins
of
mankind
thus
the
two
prime
articles
of
the
christian
faith
revelation
and
crucifixion
are
forever
established
as
human
and
heathen
conceptions
and
the
hope
might
be
reasonably
entertained
that
the
important
historical
facts
disclosed
in
this
work
will
have
the
effect
to
open
the
eyes
of
the
professors
of
the
christian
religion
to
see
their
serious
error
in
putting
forth
such
exalted
claims
for
their
bible
and
their
religion
as
that
of
being
perfect
products
of
infinite
wisdom
did
not
the
past
history
of
all
religious
countries
furnish
sad
proof
that
reason
and
logic
and
even
the
most
cogent
and
convincing
facts
of
science
and
history
often
prove
powerless
when
arrayed
against
a
religious
conviction
enstamped
upon
the
mind
for
thousands
of
years
in
the
past
and
transmitted
from
parent
to
child
until
it
has
grown
to
a
colossal
stature
and
become
a
part
of
the
living
tissues
of
the
soul
no
matter
how
glaringly
absurd
how
palpably
erroneous
or
how
demonstrably
false
an
opinion
or
doctrine
is
shown
to
be
they
can
not
see
it
but
will
still
continue
to
hug
it
to
their
bosoms
as
a
truth
no
facts
or
evidence
can
prove
an
overmatch
for
the
inherited
convictions
of
a
thousand
generations
in
this
respect
the
mahomedan
the
hindoo
and
the
christian
all
stand
upon
a
level
it
is
about
as
easy
to
convince
one
as
the
other
of
their
easily
demonstrated
errors
religion
of
natural
origin
among
the
numerous
errors
traceable
in
the
history
of
every
religious
sect
commemorated
in
the
annals
of
the
world
none
possesses
a
more
serious
character
or
has
been
attended
with
more
deplorable
consequences
than
that
of
assigning
a
wrong
origin
to
religion
every
bible
every
sect
every
creed
every
catechism
and
every
orthodox
sermon
teaches
that
religion
is
the
gift
of
god
that
it
is
infused
into
the
soul
by
the
spirit
and
power
of
the
lord
never
was
a
greater
mistake
ever
committed
every
student
of
anthropology
every
person
who
has
read
any
of
the
numerous
modern
works
on
mental
science
and
tested
their
facts
knows
that
religion
is
of
and
not
origin
that
it
is
a
natural
element
of
the
and
not
a
gift
from
that
it
grows
as
spontaneously
out
of
the
soul
as
flowers
spring
out
of
the
ground
it
is
as
natural
as
eating
sleeping
or
breathing
this
conclusion
is
not
the
offspring
of
mere
imagination
it
is
no
theory
but
an
and
fact
which
any
person
can
test
the
truth
of
for
himself
and
this
modern
discovery
will
at
no
distant
day
revolutionize
all
systems
of
religious
faith
in
existence
and
either
dissolve
and
dissipate
them
or
modify
and
establish
them
upon
a
more
natural
and
enduring
basis
expurgated
of
their
dogmatic
errors
let
us
then
labor
to
banish
the
delusion
believed
and
taught
by
a
thousand
systems
of
worship
jew
pagan
and
christian
that
religion
is
of
supernatural
or
divine
origin
and
the
many
ruinous
errors
senseless
dogmas
and
deplorable
superstitions
so
thoroughly
inwrought
into
the
christian
system
will
vanish
like
fog
before
the
morning
sun
and
be
replaced
by
a
religion
which
sensible
intelligent
and
scientific
men
and
women
can
accept
and
will
delight
to
honor
and
practice
address
to
the
clergy
friends
and
brethren
teachers
of
the
christian
faith
will
you
believe
us
when
we
tell
you
the
divine
claims
of
your
religion
are
gone
all
swept
away
by
the
logic
of
history
and
nullified
by
the
demonstrations
of
science
the
recently
opened
fountains
of
historic
law
many
of
whose
potent
facts
will
be
found
interspersed
through
the
pages
of
this
work
sweep
away
the
last
inch
of
ground
on
which
can
be
predicated
the
least
show
for
either
the
divine
origin
of
the
christian
religion
or
the
divinity
of
jesus
christ
for
these
facts
demonstrate
beyond
all
cavil
and
criticism
and
with
a
logical
force
which
can
leave
not
the
vestige
of
a
doubt
upon
any
unbiased
mind
that
all
its
doctrines
are
an
outgrowth
from
older
heathen
systems
several
systems
of
religion
essentially
the
same
in
character
and
spirit
as
that
religion
now
known
as
christianity
and
setting
forth
the
same
doctrines
principles
and
precepts
and
several
personages
filling
a
chapter
in
history
almost
identical
with
that
of
jesus
christ
it
is
now
known
to
those
who
are
up
with
the
discoveries
and
intelligence
of
the
age
were
venerated
in
the
east
centuries
before
a
religion
called
christian
or
a
personage
called
jesus
christ
were
known
to
history
will
you
not
then
give
it
up
that
your
religion
is
merely
a
human
production
reconstructed
from
heathen
materials
from
oriental
systems
several
thousand
years
older
than
yours
or
will
you
continue
in
spite
of
the
unanimous
and
unalterable
verdict
of
history
science
facts
and
logic
to
proclaim
to
the
world
the
now
historically
demonstrated
error
which
you
have
so
long
preached
that
god
is
the
author
of
your
religion
and
jesus
christ
a
messiah
though
you
may
have
heretofore
honestly
believed
these
doctrines
to
be
true
you
can
now
no
longer
plead
ignorance
as
an
excuse
for
propagating
such
gigantic
and
serious
errors
as
they
are
now
overwhelmingly
demonstrated
by
a
thousand
facts
of
history
to
be
untrue
you
must
abandon
such
exalted
claims
for
your
religion
or
posterity
will
mark
you
as
being
blind
leaders
of
the
blind
they
will
heap
upon
your
honored
names
their
unmitigated
ridicule
and
condemnation
they
will
charge
you
as
being
either
deplorably
ignorant
or
disloyal
to
the
cause
of
truth
and
shame
and
ignominy
will
be
your
portion
the
following
propositions
fatal
to
your
claims
for
christianity
are
established
beyond
confutation
by
the
historical
facts
cited
in
this
work
viz
there
were
many
cases
of
the
miraculous
birth
of
gods
reported
in
history
before
the
case
of
jesus
christ
also
many
other
cases
of
gods
being
born
of
virgin
mothers
many
of
these
gods
like
christ
were
reputedly
born
on
the
of
december
their
advent
into
the
world
like
that
of
jesus
christ
is
in
many
cases
claimed
to
have
been
foretold
by
inspired
prophets
stars
figured
at
the
birth
of
several
of
them
as
in
the
case
of
christ
also
angels
shepherds
and
magi
or
wise
men
many
of
them
like
christ
were
claimed
to
be
of
royal
or
princely
descent
their
lives
like
his
were
also
threatened
in
infancy
by
the
ruler
of
the
country
several
of
them
like
him
gave
early
proof
of
divinity
and
like
him
retired
from
the
world
and
fasted
also
like
him
declared
my
kingdom
is
not
of
this
world
some
of
them
preached
a
spiritual
religion
too
like
his
and
were
anointed
with
oil
like
him
many
of
them
like
him
were
crucified
for
the
sins
of
the
world
and
after
three
days
interment
rose
from
the
dead
and
finally
like
him
are
reported
as
ascending
back
to
heaven
the
same
violent
convulsions
of
nature
at
the
crucifixion
of
several
are
reported
they
were
nearly
all
called
saviors
son
of
god
messiah
redeemer
lord
each
one
was
the
second
member
of
the
trinity
of

the
doctrines
of

sin
fall
of

the
atonement
the
trinity
the
word
forgiveness
an
angry
god
future
endless
punishment
etc
see
the
author
biography
of
satan
were
a
part
of
the
religion
of
each
of
these
gods
as
found
set
forth
in
several
oriental
bibles
and
holy
books
similar
in
character
and
spirit
to
the
christian
bible
and
written
like
it
by
inspired
and
holy
men
before
the
time
of
either
christ
or
moses
before
moses
in
some
cases
at
least
all
these
doctrines
and
declarations
and
many
others
not
here
enumerated
the
historical
citations
of
this
work
abundantly
prove
were
taught
in
various
oriental
heathen
nations
centuries
before
the
birth
of
christ
or
before
christianity
as
a
religion
was
known
in
the
world
will
you
then
after
learning
these
facts
longer
dare
assert
that
christianity
is
of
divine
emanation
or
claim
a
special
divine
paternity
for
its
author
only
the
priest
who
loves
his
more
than
the
cause
of
and
i
fear
this
class
are
numerous
or
who
is
deplorably
ignorant
of
history
will
have
the
effrontery
or
audacity
to
do
so
for
the
historical
facts
herein
set
forth
as
clearly
prove
such
assumptions
to
be
false
as
figures
can
demonstrate
the
truth
of
any
mathematical
problem
and
no
logic
can
overthrow
and
no
sophistry
can
set
aside
these
facts
they
will
stand
till
the
end
of
time
in
spite
of
your
efforts
either
to
evade
ignore
or
invalidate
them
we
will
here
briefly
state
why
all
the
ancient
religions
were
alike
two
causes
are
obviously
assignable
for
christianity
in
all
its
essential
features
and
phases
being
so
strikingly
similar
to
the
ancient
pagan
systems
which
preceded
it
as
also
the
close
analogies
of
all
the
principal
systems
whose
doctrines
and
practical
teachings
have
found
a
place
on
the
pages
of
history
the
primary
and
constituent
elements
and
properties
of
human
nature
being
essentially
the
same
in
all
countries
and
all
centuries
and
the
feeling
called
religion
being
a
spontaneous
outgrowth
of
the
devotional
elements
of
the
human
mind
the
coincidence
would
naturally
produce
similar
feelings
similar
thoughts
similar
views
and
similar
doctrines
on
the
subject
of
religion
in
different
countries
however
widely
separated
this
accounts
in
part
for
the
analogous
features
observable
in
all
the
primary
systems
of
religious
faith
which
have
flourished
in
the
past
ages
a
more
potent
cause
however
for
the
proximate
identity
extending
to
such
an
elaborate
detail
as
is
evinced
by
the
foregoing
schedule
is
found
in
the
historical
incident
which
brought
the
disciples
of
the
various
systems
of
worship
together
face
to
face
in
the
then
grand
religious
emporium
of
the
world
the
royal
and
renowned
city
of
alexandria
the
capital
of
egypt
here
drawn
together
by
various
motives
and
influences
the
devotee
of
india
the
devout
disciple
of
buddhism
the
worshipper
of
mithra
the
mediator
the
representatives
of
the
crucified
quexalcoate
of
mexico
the
essene
the
superstitious
egyptian
the
godly
chaldean
the
imitative
judean
founders
of
christianity
and
the
disciples
of
other
gods
met
and
interchanged
ideas
discussed
their
various
dogmas
remolded
their
doctrines
and
recast
and
rehabilitated
their
systems
of
religious
faith
by
borrowing
from
each
other
and
from
other
systems
there
represented
in
this
way
all
became
remarkably
similar
and
alike
in
all
their
doctrines
and
details
and
thus
the
mystery
is
solved
and
the
singular
resemblance
of
all
the
ancient
systems
of
religion
satisfactorily
accounted
for
for
a
fuller
explanation
of
this
matter
see
chapters
xxx
and
xxxi
of
this
work
in
conclusion
please
note
the
following
points
the
religious
conceptions
of
the
old
testament
are
as
easily
traced
to
heathen
sources
as
those
of
the
new
testament
but
we
are
compelled
to
exclude
such
an
exposition
from
this
work
the
comparative
exhibition
of
the
doctrines
and
teachings
of
twenty
bibles
which
proves
them
to
be
in
their
leading
features
essentially
alike
originally
designed
for
this
volume
is
found
to
be
when
completed
of
sufficient
magnitude
to
constitute
a
volume
of
itself
here
i
desire
to
impress
upon
the
minds
of
my
clerical
brethren
the
important
fact
that
the
gospel
histories
of
christ
were
written
by
men
who
had
formerly
been
jews
see
acts
xxi
and
probably
possessing
the
strong
proclivity
to
imitate
and
borrow
which
their
bible
shows
was
characteristic
of
that
nation
and
being
written
many
years
after
christ
death
according
to
that
standard
christian
author
lardner
it
was
impossible
under
such
circumstances
for
them
to
separate
if
they
had
desired
to
the
real
facts
and
events
of
his
life
from
the
innumerable
fictions
and
fables
then
afloat
everywhere
relative
to
the
heathen
gods
who
had
a
similar
history
two
reasons
are
thus
furnished
for
their
constructing
a
history
of
christ
almost
identical
with
that
of
other
gods
as
shown
in
chapters
xxxi
and
xxxii
of
this
work
the
singular
and
senseless
defense
of
your
now
tottering
system
we
have
known
to
be
attempted
by
members
of
your
order
by
the
soliloquy
christianity
whether
divine
or
human
is
good
enough
for
me
but
such
a
subterfuge
betrays
both
a
weak
mind
and
a
weak
cause
the
disciples
of
all
the
oriental
systems
cherished
a
similar
feeling
and
a
similar
sentiment
and
the
deluded
followers
of
brigham
young
exclaimed
in
like
manner
i
want
nothing
better
than
mormonism
snakes
lizards
and
frogs
are
good
enough
for
me
a
south
sea
islander
once
exclaimed
to
a
missionary
when
a
reform
diet
was
proposed
such
logic
if
universally
adopted
would
keep
the
world
eternally
in
barbarism
no
progress
can
be
made
where
such
sentiments
prevail
the
truth
is
no
system
of
religion
whatever
its
ostensible
marks
of
perfection
can
long
remain
good
enough
for
aspiring
and
progressive
minds
unless
occasionally
improved
like
other
institutions
and
then
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
our
controversy
does
not
appertain
so
much
to
the
character
as
to
the
origin
of
the
christian
religion
our
many
incontrovertible
proofs
that
it
is
of
human
and
heathen
origin
proves
at
the
same
time
that
it
is
an
imperfect
system
and
as
such
needing
occasional
improvement
like
other
institutions
and
its
assumed
perfection
and
divine
origin
which
have
always
guarded
it
from
improvement
amply
accounts
for
its
present
corrupt
immoral
declining
and
dying
condition
and
it
will
ere
long
die
with
paralysis
unless
its
assumption
of
divine
perfection
is
soon
exchanged
for
the
principles
of
improvement
and
reconstruction
this
policy
alone
can
save
it
we
will
here
notice
another
feeble
futile
and
foolish
expedient
we
have
known
resorted
to
by
persons
of
your
order
to
save
your
sinking
cause
when
the
evidence
is
presented
with
such
cogency
as
to
admit
of
no
disproof
that
all
the
important
doctrines
of
christianity
were
taught
by
older
heathen
systems
before
the
era
of
christ
the
plea
is
that
those
systems
were
mere
types
or
of
the
christian
religion
but
this
plea
is
of
itself
a
borrowed
subterfuge
of
heathenism
and
is
moreover
devoid
of
evidence
the
ancient
egyptians
also
the
greeks
claimed
that
brahminism
was
a
type
or
of
their
religious
systems
and
mahomedans
now
claim
that
both
judaism
and
christianity
were
designed
by
god
as
foreshadowing
types
of
religion
of
the
koran
and
the
disciples
of
more
than
a
thousand
systems
of
religion
which
have
flourished
in
past
ages
could
have
made
such
logic
equally
available
in
showing
in
each
case
that
every
system
preceding
theirs
was
designed
by
infinite
wisdom
as
simply
a
typical
or
forerunner
of
theirs
how
ridiculous
and
senseless
therefore
is
the
argument
thus
shown
to
be
when
critically
examined
in
the
light
of
history
so
much
so
as
scarcely
to
merit
a
serious
notice
here
permit
us
to
say
that
we
believe
christianity
to
be
not
only
of
human
origin
but
of
natural
origin
also
i
that
is
a
natural
outgrowth
like
other
systems
of
the
religious
elements
of
the
human
mind
a
hypothesis
which
accounts
most
beautifully
for
the
numerous
human
imperfections
now
visible
in
nearly
every
line
of
its
teachings
those
imperfections
correspond
exactly
to
the
imperfect
minds
which
produced
it
and
we
believe
that
the
principle
teacher
of
christianity
the
man
christ
jesus
possessed
a
very
exalted
and
superior
mind
for
that
age
in
the
moral
and
religious
departments
and
in
the
intellectual
to
some
extent
also
but
his
superiority
in
these
respects
was
not
probably
greater
than
that
of
zera
colburn
or
henry
salford
in
the
mathematical
department
and
all
probably
derived
their
peculiar
extraordinary
traits
of
mind
from
the
same
causes
that
of
strong
psychological
influence
impressed
upon
the
mind
of
the
mothers
prior
to
their
births
had
these
influences
been
as
well
understood
then
as
now
we
presume
christ
would
have
escaped
the
fate
of
an
exaltation
to
the
godhead
the
author
stating
the
above
demonstrates
that
same
assumption
of
a
which
he
criticises
in
the
christians
mohamedens
and
other
proponents
of
religions
in
conclusion
permit
us
to
say
that
the
numerous
and
overwhelming
facts
of
this
work
render
it
utterly
impossible
that
the
exalted
claims
you
put
forth
for
your
religion
and
its
assumed
author
that
of
a
divine
character
can
be
true
and
posterity
will
so
decide
whether
you
do
or
not
cherishing
for
you
naught
but
feelings
of
kindness
and
brotherly
love
and
desiring
to
promote
the
truth
we
will
answer
any
question
or
discuss
any
proposition
embraced
in
this
work

sixteen

saviors
chapter
i
rival
claims
of
the
saviors
it
is
claimed
by
the
disciples
of
jesus
christ
that
he
was
of
supernatural
and
divine
origin
that
he
had
a
human
being
for
a
mother
and
a
god
for
his
father
that
although
he
was
he
was
and
molded
in
the
human
form
but
comprehending
in
essence
a
full
measure
of
the
infinite
godhead
thus
making
him
half
human
and
half
divine
in
his
sublunary
origin
it
is
claimed
that
he
was
full
and
perfect
god
and
perfect
man
and
while
he
was
god
he
was
also
the
son
of
god
and
as
such
was
sent
down
by
his
father
to
save
a
fallen
and
guilty
world
and
that
thus
his
mission
pertained
to
the
whole
human
race
and
his
inspired
seers
are
made
to
declare
that
ultimately
every
nation
tongue
kindred
and
people
under
heaven
will
acknowledge
allegiance
to
his
government
and
concede
his
right
to
reign
and
rule
the
world
that
every
knee
must
bow
and
every
tongue
confess
that
jesus
is
lord
to
the
glory
of
god
the
father
but
we
do
not
find
that
this
prophecy
has
ever
been
or
is
likely
to
be
fulfilled
we
do
not
observe
that
this
claim
to
the
infinite
deityship
of
jesus
christ
has
been
or
is
likely
to
be
universally
conceded
on
the
contrary
it
is
found
that
by
a
portion
and
a
large
portion
of
the
people
of
even
those
nations
now
called
christian
this
claim
has
been
steadily
and
unswervingly
controverted
through
the
whole
line
of
history
stretching
through
the
nearly
two
thousand
years
which
have
elapsed
since
his
advent
to
earth
even
some
of
those
who
are
represented
to
have
been
personally
acquainted
with
him
aye
some
of
his
own
brethren
in
the
flesh
children
in
the
same
household
children
of
the
same
mother
had
the
temerity
to
question
the
tenableness
of
his
claim
to
a
divine
emanation
and
when
we
extend
our
researches
to
other
countries
we
find
this
claim
so
far
from
being
conceded
is
denied
and
contested
by
whole
nations
upon
other
grounds
it
is
met
and
confronted
by
rival
claims
upon
this
ground
hundreds
of
millions
of
the
established
believers
in
divine
revelation
hundreds
of
millions
of
believers
in
the
divine
character
and
origin
of
religion
eject
the
pretentions
set
up
for
jesus
christ
they
admit
both
a
god
and
a
savior
but
do
not
accept
jesus
of
nazareth
as
being
either
they
admit
a
messiah
but
not
the
messiah
these
nations
contend
that
the
title
is
misplaced
which
makes
the
man
christ
jesus
the
savior
of
the
world
they
claim
to
have
been
honored
with
the
birth
of
the
true
savior
among
them
and
defend
this
claim
upon
the
ground
of
priority
of
date
they
aver
that
the
advent
of
their
messiahs
were
long
prior
to
that
of
the
christians
and
that
this
circumstance
adjudicates
for
them
a
superiority
of
claim
as
to
having
had
the
true
messiah
born
upon
their
soil
it
is
argued
that
as
the
story
of
the
incarnation
of
the
savior
is
of
more
recent
date
than
that
of
these
oriental
and
ancient
religions
as
is
conceded
by
christians
themselves
the
origin
of
the
former
is
thus
indicated
and
foreshadowed
as
being
an
outgrowth
from
if
not
a
plagiarism
upon
the
latter
a
borrowed
copy
of
which
the
pagan
stories
furnish
the
original
here
then
we
observe
a
rivalship
of
claims
as
to
which
of
the
remarkable
personages
who
have
figured
in
the
world
as
saviors
messiahs
and
sons
of
god
in
different
ages
and
different
countries
can
be
considered
the
true
savior
and
sent
of
god
or
whether
all
should
be
or
the
claims
of
all
rejected
for
researches
into
oriental
history
reveal
the
remarkable
fact
that
stories
of
incarnate
gods
answering
to
and
resembling
the
miraculous
character
of
jesus
christ
have
been
prevalent
in
most
if
not
all
the
principal
religious
heathen
nations
of
antiquity
and
the
accounts
and
narrations
of
some
of
these
deific
incarnations
bear
such
a
striking
resemblance
to
that
of
the
christian
savior
not
only
in
their
general
features
but
in
some
cases
in
the
most
minute
details
from
the
legend
of
the
immaculate
conception
to
that
of
the
crucifixion
and
subsequent
ascension
into
heaven
that
one
might
almost
be
mistaken
for
the
other
more
than
twenty
claims
of
this
kind
claims
of
beings
invested
with
divine
honor
deified
have
come
forward
and
presented
themselves
at
the
bar
of
the
world
with
their
credentials
to
contest
the
verdict
of
christendom
in
having
proclaimed
jesus
christ
the
only
son
and
sent
of
god
twenty
messiahs
saviors
and
sons
of
god
according
to
history
or
tradition
have
in
past
times
descended
from
heaven
and
taken
upon
themselves
the
form
of
men
clothing
themselves
with
human
flesh
and
furnishing
incontestable
evidence
of
a
divine
origin
by
various
miracles
marvelous
works
and
superlative
virtues
and
finally
these
twenty
jesus
christs
accepting
their
character
for
the
name
laid
the
foundation
for
the
salvation
of

furnish

doctrine

recorded

of

surely
with
so
many
saviors
the
world
can
not
or
should
not
be
lost
we
have
now
presented
before
us
a
ground
for
doubting
and
disputing
the
claims
put
forth
by
the
christian
world
in
behalf
of
our
lord
and
savior
jesus
christ
in
the
first
place
allowing
the
question
to
be
answered
in
the
affirmative
as
to
whether
he
was
really
a
savior
or
supernatural
being
or
more
than
a
mere
man
a
negative
answer
to
which
seems
to
have
been
sprung
as
previously
intimated
at
the
very
hour
of
his
birth
and
that
by
his
kindred
his
own
nearest
relatives
as
it
is
declared
his
own
brethren
did
not
believe
on
him
a
skepticism
which
has
been
growing
deeper
and
broader
from
that
day
to
this
and
now
upon
the
heel
of
this
question
we
find
another
formidable
query
to
be
met
and
answered
viz
was
he
christ
the
only
savior
seeing
that
a
multitude
of
similar
claims
are
now
upon
our
to
be
disposed
of
we
shall
however
leave
the
theologians
of
the
various
religious
schools
to
adjust
and
settle
this
difficulty
among
themselves
we
shall
leave
them
to
settle
the
question
as
best
they
can
as
to
whether
jesus
christ
was
the
only
son
and
sent
of
god
the
only
begotten
of
the
father
as
john
declares
him
to
be
john
i
in
view
of
the
fact
that
long
prior
to
his
time
various
personages
in
different
nations
were
invested
with
the
title
son
of
god
and
have
left
behind
them
similar
proofs
and
credentials
of
the
justness
of
their
claims
to
such
a
title
if
being
essentially
alike
as
we
shall
prove
and
demonstrate
them
to
be
can
make
their
claims
similar
we
shall
present
an
array
of
facts
and
historical
proofs
drawn
from
numerous
histories
and
the
holy
scriptures
and
bibles
appertaining
to
these
various
saviors
and
which
include
a
history
of
their
lives
and
doctrines
that
will
go
to
show
that
in
nearly
all
their
leading
features
and
mostly
even
in
their
details
they
are
strikingly
similar
a
comparison
or
parallel
view
extended
through
their
sacred
histories
so
as
to
include
an
exhibition
presented
in
parallels
of
the
teachings
of
their
respective
bibles
would
make
it
clearly
manifest
that
with
respect
to
nearly
every
important
thought
deed
word
action
doctrine
principle
precept
tenet
ritual
ordinance
or
ceremony
and
even
the
various
important
characters
or
personages
who
figure
in
their
religious
dramas
as
saviors
prophets
apostles
angels
devils
demons
exalted
or
fallen
genii
in
a
word
nearly
every
miraculous
or
marvelous
story
moral
precept
or
tenet
of
religious
faith
noticed
in
either
the
old
or
new
testament
scriptures
of
christendom
from
the
jewish
cosmogony
or
story
of
creation
in
genesis
to
the
last
legendary
tale
in
john
arabian
nights
alias
the
apocalypse
there
is
to
be
found
an
antitype
for
or
outline
of
somewhere
in
the
sacred
records
or
bibles
of
the
oriental
heathen
nations
making
equal
if
not
higher
pretention
to
a
divine
emanation
and
divine
inspiration
and
admitted
by
all
historians
even
the
most
orthodox
to
be
of
much
more
ancient
date
for
while
christians
only
claim
for
the
earthly
advent
of
their
savior
and
the
birth
of
their
religion
a
period
less
than
nineteen
hundred
years
in
the
past
on
the
contrary
most
of
the
deific
or
divine
incarnations
of
the
heathen
and
their
respective
religions
are
by
the
concurrent
and
united
verdict
of
all
history
assigned
a
date
several
hundred
or
several
thousand
years
earlier
thus
leaving
the
inference
patent
that
so
far
as
there
has
been
any
borrowing
or
transfer
of
materials
from
one
system
to
another
christianity
has
been
the
borrower
and
as
nearly
the
whole
outline
and
constituent
parts
of
the
christian
system
are
found
scattered
through
these
older
systems
the
query
is
at
once
sprung
as
to
whether
christianity
did
not
derive
its
materials
from
these
sources
that
is
from
heathenism
instead
of
from
high
heaven
as
it
claims
chapter
ii
messianic
prophecies
nearly
all
religious
history
is
prophetic
of
the
coming
of
saviors
messiahs
redeemers
and
gods
most
religious
countries
and
more
than
a
score
of
religious
systems
had
a
standing
prophecy
that
a
divine
deliverer
would
descend
from
heaven
and
relieve
them
from
their
depressed
state
and
ameliorate
their
condition
and
in
most
cases
that
prophecy
was
believed
to
have
been
fulfilled
by
the
birth
of
a
being
who
as
he
approached
the
goal
of
moral
and
intellectual
manhood
exhibited
such
remarkable
proof
of
superiority
of
mind
as
to
be
readily
accepted
as
the
promised
messiah
we
can
only
find
room
for
a
few
citations
and
illustrations
in
proof
of
this
statement
many
texts
have
been
hunted
out
and
marked
in
the
christian
bible
by
interested
priests
as
prophetic
of
the
coming
and
mission
of
christ
but
a
thorough
candid
and
impartial
investigation
will
convince
any
reader
that
of
these
have
the
remotest
allusion
to
christ
nor
were
they
intended
to
have
on
the
contrary
most
of
them
refer
to
events
already
past
the
others
are
the
mere
ebullitions
of
feelings
hopefully
prayerful
in
their
anticipation
of
better
times
but
very
indefinite
as
to
the
period
and
the
agencies
or
means
in
which
or
by
which
the
desired
reformation
was
to
be
brought
about
a
divine
man
was
prayed
for
and
hopefully
expected
but
no
such
being
as
jesus
christ
is
anticipated
or
alluded
to
or
dreamed
of
by
the
prophecies
and
it
requires
the
most
unwarrantable
distortion
to
make
one
text
refer
to
him
but
this
perversion
has
been
wrought
on
many
texts
we
will
cite
one
case
in
proof
in
isaiah
famous
prophecy
the
phrase
unto
us
a
child
is
born
isa
ix
the
context
clearly
shows
refers
to
the
prophet
own
child
and
the
past
tense
is
born
is
an
evidence
the
child
was
then
born
and
the
title
mighty
god
found
in
the
text
dr
beard
shows
should
have
been
translated
the
mighty
hero
thus
proving
it
has
no
reference
to
a
god
and
the
everlasting
father
should
have
been
rendered
according
to
this
christian
writer
the
father
of
the
everlasting
age
and
other
texts
often
quoted
as
prophecies
by
biased
christian
writers
the
doctor
proves
are
erroneously
translated
and
have
no
more
reference
to
christ
than
to
mahomet
it
is
true
the
jews
in
common
with
other
nations
cherished
strong
anticipations
of
the
arrival
of
a
mighty
deliverer
amongst
them
and
this
august
personage
some
of
them
supposed
would
be
a
god
or
a
a
hence
such
prophetic
utterances
as
behold
a
king
shall
reign
in
righteousness
isa
xxxii
i
and
all
nations
shall
flow
unto
zion
isa
ii
the
hindoo
budhists
long
previously
indulged
similar
anticipations
with
respect
to
the
triumph
of
their
religion
hence
their
seers
prophesied
that
at
the
end
of
the
cali
yug
period
a
divine
child
avatar
or
savior
would
be
born
who
would
understand
the
divine
writings
the
holy
scriptures
and
the
sciences
without
the
labor
of
learning
them
he
will
supremely
understand
all
things
he
will
relieve
the
earth
of
sin
and
cause
justice
and
truth
to
reign
everywhere
and
will
bring
the
whole
earth
into
the
acceptance
of
the
hindoo
religion
and
the
hindoo
prophet
bala
also
predicted
that
a
divine
savior
would
become
incarnate
in
the
house
of
yadu
and
issue
forth
to
mortal
birth
from
the
womb
of
devaci
a
holy
virgin
and
relieve
the
oppressed
earth
of
its
load
of
sin
and
sorrow
much
more
similar
language
may
be
found
in
their
holy
bible
the
vedas
colonel
wilford
tells
us
the
advent
of
their
savior
chrishna
occurred
in
exact
fulfillment
of
prophecy
found
in
their
sacred
books
and
the
chinese
bible
also
contains
a
number
of
messianic
prophecies
in
one
of
the
five
volumes

prophecy

thus
the
holy
one
when
he
comes
will
unite
in
himself
all
the
virtues
of
heaven
and
earth
by
his
justice
the
world
will
be
established
in
righteousness
he
will
labor
and
suffer
much
and
will
finally
offer
up

the

we
will
also
give
place
to
a
messianic
prophecy
of
persia
faber
an
english
writer
in
his
history
of
idolatry
tells
us
that
zoroaster
prophetically
declared
that
a
virgin
should
conceive
and
bear
a
son
and
a
star
would
appear
blazing
at
midday
to
signalize
the
occurrence
when
you
behold
the
star

to
his
followers

child
offering
him

with
profound
humility
he
is
indeed

vol
ii
abulfaragius
in
his
historia
dynastarium
and
maurice
in
his
indian
skeptics
refuted
both
speak
of
this
prophecy
fulfilled
according
to
higgins
by
the
advent
of
the
persian
and
chaldean
god
josa
and
chalcidus
of
the
second
century
in
his
comments
on
the
times
of
plato
speaks
of
a
star
which
presaged
neither
disease
nor
death
but
the
descent
of
a
god
amongst
men
and
which
is
attested
by
chaldean
astronomers
who
immediately
hastened
to
adore
the
newborn
deity
and
present
him
gifts
we
are
compelled
to
omit
for
the
want
of
room
the
notice
of
numerous
messianic
prophecies
found
in
the
sacred
writings
of
egypt
greece
rome
mexico
arabia
and
other
countries
all
of
which
tend
to
show
that
the
same
prophetic
spirit
pervaded
all
religious
countries
reliable
only
to
the
extent
it
might
have
issued
from
an
interior
spiritual
vision
or
have
been
illuminated
by
departed
spirits
and
we
find
as
much
evidence
that
these
pagan
prophecies
were
inspired
and
also
fulfilled
as
those
found
in
bible
thus
reducing
all
to
a
common
level
the
possibility
of
the
interior
vision
being
expanded
and
illuminated
by
spiritual
beings
so
as
to
enable
the
possessor
to
forestall
the
occurrence
of
future
events
we
however
by
no
means
deny
since
we
have
abundant
proof
of
it
in
connection
with
the
practical
history
of
modern
spiritualism

to
show
the

to
prove
that
those
christian

who
assume

a

from

were
profoundly
ignorant
of
oriental
history
as
the

in
several
heathen
systems
of
older

of

here
it
will
be
observed
that
they
are
both
couched
in

again
it
is
related
by
more
than
one
oriental
writer
that
chrishna
of

is
represented
on
some
very
ancient
sculptures
and
stone
monuments
with
his
heel
on
the

of
a

of

with
that
found
in

christian
bible
as
very
mysterious

author
tells
us
the
image
of
chrishna
is
sculptured
in
the
ancient
temples
of

sometimes
wreathed
in
the
folds
of
a

we
are
told
a
messenger
from
heaven
announced
to
the
first
woman
created
suchiquecul
that
she
should
bear
a
son
who
should
bruise
the
serpent
head
and
then
presented
her
with
a
rose
here
is
the
origin
of
the
genesis
legend
the
rose
being
the
fruit
of
the
tree
of
the
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
the
ancient
persians
says
volney
in
his
ruin
of
empires
had
the
tradition
of
a
virgin
from
whom
they
predicted
would
be
born
or
would
spring
up
a
shoot
a
son
that
would
crush
the
serpent
head
and
thus
deliver
the
world
from
sin
and
both
the
serpent
and
the
virgin
he
tells
us
are
represented
imaginarily
in
the
heavens
and
pictured
on
their
astronomical
globes
and
spheres
as
on
those
of
the
romish
christian
see
burritt
geography
of
the
heavens
in
the
ancient
etrurian
story
instead
of
the
seed
of
the
woman
the
virgin
it
is
the
woman
herself
who
is
represented
as
standing
with
one
foot
on
the
head
of
a
serpent
which
has
the
twig
of
an
apple
tree
in
its
mouth
to
which
an
apple
is
suspended
the
forbidden
fruit
while
its
tail
is
twisted
around
a
celestial
globe
thus
reminding
us
of
john
dragon
hauling
down
of
the

in
the
ancient
celestial
diagram
of
the
etrurian
the
head
of

virgin
is
surmounted
with
a
crown

the
same
legend
from
which
john
borrowed
his
metaphor
of
a
a
woman
with
a
crown
of
twelve
stars
on
her
head
rev
xiii
the
queen
of
the
stars
spoken
of
in
some
of
the
ancient
systems
appertains
to
the
same
fable
also
the
tradition
of
achilles
of
greece
being
invulnerable
in
the
heel
as
related
by
homer
the
last
clause
of
the
first
text
quoted
reads
shall
bruise
thy
head
a
very
curious
prophetic
reference
to
the
savior
of
the
world
if
the
text
refers
to
him
to
represent
him
as
being
of
the
neuter
gender
for
the
neuter
pronoun
always
refers
to
a
thing
without
sex
in
the
further
exposition
of
the
serpent
tradition
we
are
now
brought
to
notice
and
will
trace
to
its
origin
the
story
of
the
original
transgression
and
fall
of
man
two
cardinal
doctrines
of
the
christian
religion
like
every
other
tenet
of
the
christian
faith
we
find
these
doctrines
taught
in
heathen
systems
much
older
than
christianity
and
whose
antiquity
antedates
even
the
birth
of
moses
we
will
first
notice
the
persian
tradition
according
to
the
doctrine
of
the
persians
says
the
rev
pitrat
meshia
and
meshiane
the
first
man
and
first
woman
were
pure
and
submitted
to
ormuzd
their
maker
but
ahriman
the
evil
one
saw
them
and
envied
them
their
happiness
he
approached
them
under
the
form
of
a
serpent
presented
fruits
to
them
and
persuaded
them
that
he
was
the
maker
of
man
of
animals
of
plants
and
of
the
beautiful
universe
in
which
they
dwelt
they
believed
it
since
that
time
ahriman
was
their
master
their
natures
became
corrupt
and
this
corruption
infested
their
whole
posterity
this
story
is
taken
from
the
vandidatsade
of
the
persians
pp
and
the
indian
or
hindoo
story
is
furnished
us
by
the
rev
father
bouchat
in
a
letter
to
the
bishops
of
avranches
and
runs
thus
our
hindoos
say
the
gods
tried
by
all
means
to
obtain
immortality
after
many
inquiries
and
trials
they
conceived
the
idea
that
they
would
find
it
in
the
tree
of
life
which
is
the
chorcan
paradise
in
fact
they
succeeded
and
by
eating
once
in
a
while
of
the
fruits
of
that
tree
they
kept
the
precious
treasure
they
so
much
valued
a
famous
snake
named
cheiden
saw
that
the
tree
of
life
had
been
found
by
the
gods
of
the
second
order
as
probably
he
had
been
intrusted
with
guarding
that
tree
he
became
so
angry
because
his
vigilance
had
been
deceived
that
he
immediately
poured
out
an
enormous
quantity
of
poison
which
spread
over
the
whole
earth
how
much
like
this
story
is
the
story
of
john
and
the
serpent
cast
out
of
his
mouth
water
as
a
flood
after
the
woman
that
he
might
cause
her
to
be
carried
away
of
the
flood
rev
xii
the
idea
of
a
snake
or
serpent
inundating
the
earth
from
its
mouth
as
taught
in
both
stories
is
so
novel
and
so
far
removed
from
the
sphere
of
natural
causes
and
possible
events
that
we
are
compelled
to
the
conclusion
that
one
is
borrowed
from
the
other
or
both
from
a
common
original
and
as
facts
cited
in
other
chapters
prove
beyond
dispute
that
the
hindoo
system
containing
this
story
extends
in
antiquity
far
beyond
the
time
of
moses
the
question
is
thus
settled
as
to
which
system
borrowed
the
story
from
the
other
before
closing
the
chapter
we
wish
to
call
the
attention
of
the
reader
to
the
important
fact
that
three
out
of
four
of
the
cardinal
doctrines
of
the
christian
faith
are
taught
in
the
two
heathen
mythological
stories
of
creation
just
presented
viz
original
sin
the
fall
of
man
caused
by
a
serpent
the
consequent
corruption
and
depravity
of
the
human
race
these
doctrines
then
it
must
be
admitted
are
of
heathen
origin
and
not
as
christians
claim
important
truths
revealed
from
heaven
for
a
historical
exposition
of
the
other
cardinal
doctrine
of
the
christian
faith
man
restoration
by
the
atonement
achieved
through
the
crucifixion
of
a
god
see
chapters
xvi
and
xxi
chapter
iv
miraculous
and
immaculate
conception
of
the
gods
the
ancients
very
naturally
concluded
that
an
offspring
of
god
a
son
of
god
should
have
a
purer
higher
and
holier
maternal
origin
than
is
incident
to
the
lot
of
mortals
and
this
was
to
constitute
one
of
the
evidences
of
his
emanation
from
the
deity
that
is
of
his
supernatural
or
divine
origin
he
as
a
matter
of
course
must
not
only
have
a
different
origin
but
one
in
the
highest
degree
superior
and
supernatural
he
must
not
only
be
able
to
claim
the
highest
origin
but
the
highest
also
and
on
the
part
of
the
mother
a
sexual
connection
with
the
great
potentate
of
heaven
would
evince
for
her
offspring
the
very
acme
of
superiority
with
respect
to
his
origin
moral
perfection
and
authority
that
the
savior
was
born
of
a
woman
could
not
possibly
be
made
a
matter
of
concealment
but
his
paternal
parentage
was
not
so
obvious
and
apparent
to
general
observation
being
cognizant
alone
to
the
mother
this
circumstance
furnished
the
most
propititious
opportunity
to
concoct
the
story
that
the
most
high
had
condescended
and
descended
to
become
both
a
father
and
a
grandfather
to
a
human
being
or
a
being
apparently
human
at
least
we
say
grandfather
because
if
god
as
the
christian
bible
itself
frequently
asserts
both
directly
and
by
implication
is
father
of
the
whole
human
family
then
he
was
father
to
the
maternal
parent
so
that
her
son
though
deriving
existence
from
him
would
be
his
grandson
as
well
as
his
son
hence
the
corollary
christ
was
a
grandson
of
god
as
well
as
a
son
of
and
jehovah
both
his
father
and
grandfather
again
to
make
the
origin
and
character
of
the
god
and
savior
stand
higher
for
purity
and
partake
in
the
highest
degree
of
the
miraculous
the
impression
must
go
abroad
that
he
was
born
of
a
woman
she
was
yet
a
before
she
was
contaminated
by
illicit
association
with
the
masculine
sex
hence
nearly
all
the
saviors
were
reputedly
born
of
virgins
and
the
process
of
birth
too
was
out
of
the
line
of
natural
causes
in
order
to
invest
the
character
of
the
savior
with
the
plus
of
the
miraculous
and
hence
it
is
related
of
jesus
christ
in
an
apocryphal
gospel
of
chrishna
of
india
and
other
saviors
that
they
were
born
through
the
mother
side
it
is
true
our
present
canonical
gospels
are
silent
as
to
the
manner
of
christ
birth
but
one
of
the
apocryphal
gospels
which
gives
the
matter
in
fuller
detail
and
whose
authority
in
the
earlier
ages
of
the
christian
church
was
not
disputed
declares
that
the
manner
of
his
birth
was
as
related
above
and
besides
some
of
the
early
christian
fathers
fully
indorsed
the
story
the
same
is
related
in
the
pagan
bibles
of
heathen
gods
the
motives
which
originated
the
reports
of
the
immaculate
conception
of
the
saviors
it
may
be
further
remarked
were
of
a
character
to
establish
their
spotless
origin
as
the
word
immaculate
means
spotless
to
make
it
appear
that
there
was
a
deific
power
and
agency
concerned
in
their
conception
and
we
may
observe
here
that
it
is
not
the
saviors
alone
who
are
reported
to
have
been
ushered
into
tangible
existence
without
a
human
father
but
it
is
declared
of
beings
known
and
acknowledged
to
be
men
as
plato
pythagoras
alexander
augustus
and
a
number
of
others
of
plato
an
author
remarks
he
was
born
of
paretonia
and
begotten
of
apollo
and
not
ariston
his
father
both
the
manner
or
process
and
the
source
of
the
influence
by
which
the
gods
and
saviors
were
generated
seem
to
have
been
different
in
different
countries
though
the
idea
of
overshadowing
with
the
holy
ghost
seems
to
have
been
most
current
higgins
says
that
the
supreme
first
cause
was
generally
believe
to
overshadow
or
in
some
other
mysterious
manner
to
impregnate
the
mother
of
the
god
or
personage
vol
i
we
are
told
that
pythais
the
mother
of
pythagoras
five
hundred
and
fifty
years
conceived
by
a
spectre
or
ghost
of
course
the
holy
ghost
of
the
god
apollo
or
god
sol
in
malcolm
history
of
persia
vol
i
the
author
tells
us
that
zoroaster
was
born
of
an
immaculate
conception
by
a
ray
from
the
divine
reason
the
immaculate
conception
of
juno
of
greece
is
thus
described
by
the
poet
juno
touched
the
flower
its
wondrous
virtues
such
she
touched
it
and
grew
pregnant
at
the
touch
then
entered
thrace
the
propontic
shore
when
mistress
of
her
touch
god
mars
she
bore
this
case
may
certainly
be
set
down
as
the
plus
of
etiquette
with
respect
to
sexual
commerce
or
purity
of
conception
the
sweet
odor
of
an
expanded
flower
we
are
here
taught
is
adequate
to
the
conception
and
production
of
a
god
here
we
have
the
immaculate
conception
in
the
superlative
degree
and
while
much
more
beautiful
and
grand
it
can
not
be
more
senseless
or
unreasonable
than
the
conception
by
a
ghost
it
proves
at
least
that
the
doctrine
of
the
immaculate
conception
is
of
very
ancient
date
and
this
fastidious
maiden
lady
and
immaculate
virgin
juno
not
only
conceived
the
god
mars
by
the
touch
of
a
flower
but
she
also
so
the
story
reads
conceived
vulcan
by
being
overshadowed
by
the
wind
exactly
a
parallel
case
with
that
of
the
virgin
mary
as
we
find
that
ghost
in
the
original
means
wind
thus
we
observe
that
vulcan
long
before
jesus
christ
was
born
of
the
holy
ghost
both
were
conceived
by
the
holy
wind
and
the
author
of
the
perennial
calendar
speaks
of
the
miraculous
conception
of
juno
jugulis
the
blessed
virgin
queen
of
heaven
and
describes
it
as
falling
on
the
second
of
february
the
very
day
which
the
early
christians
celebrated
with
a
festival
as
being
the
date
of
the
conception
of
the
ever
blessed
virgin
mary
of
the
ancient
mexicans
it
is
said
they
had
the
immaculate
conception
the
crucifixion
and
the
resurrection
after
three
days
mex
vol
i
and
in
an
ancient
work
called
codex
vaticanus
the
immaculate
conception
is
spoken
of
as
a
part
of
the
history
of
quexalcote
the
mexican
savior
suchiquecal
says
the
mexican
antiquities
was
called
the
queen
of
heaven
she
conceived
a
son
without
connection
with
a
man
a
very
obvious
case
of
immaculate
conception
alvarez
semedo
in
his
history
of
china
page
speaks
of
a
sect
in
that
country
who
worshiped
a
savior
known
as
xaca
who
was
reputedly
conceived
of
his
mother
maia
by
a
white
elephant
which
she
saw
in
her
sleep
and
for
greater
purity
she
brought
him
forth
from
one
of
her
sides
colonel

tells
us
in
his
history
of

that

the
first
chinese

was
conceived
by
his

being
struck
with

case
of

it
will
be
recollected
the
star
did
not
appear
till
after

gave
birth
to
this
god
and
rival
savior
of
jesus
christ
by
having
been
previously
overshadowed
by
the
supreme
god
proteus
for
the
corporeal
existence
and
earthly
career
of
augustus
caesar
the
world
has
ostensibly
to
acknowledge
itself
indebted
to
the
overshadowing
influence
and
generating
power
of
jove
by
whose
divine
influence
he
was
immaculously
conceived
in
the
temple
of
apollo
according
to
the
statement
of
nimrod
his
biographer
the
virgin
mother
of
china
furnishes
another
case
of
immaculate
conception
possessing
a
sensibility
too
lofty
and
too
refined
to
descend
to
the
ordinary
routine
of
the
world
she
gave
birth
to
the
god
yu
from
previous
conception
by
a
water
lily
this
case
with
respect
to
the
degree
of
procreative
delicacy
and
refinement
evinced
may
be
classed
with
that
of
juno
of
greece
here
it
may
be
noted
as
a
curious
circumstance
that
several
of
the
virgin
mothers
of
gods
and
great
men
are
specifically
represented
as
going
ten
months
between
conception
and
delivery
the
mothers
of
hercules
sakia
guatama
scipio
arion
solomon
and
jesus
christ
may
be
mentioned
as
samples
of
this
character
this
tradition
probably
grew
out
of
the
established
belief
in
the
ten
sacred
cycles
which
constitute
the
great
prospective
and
portentous
millennial
epoch
as
described
in
chapter
xxx
arion
mentioned
above
is
represented
as
being
both
miraculously
and
immaculously
conceived
by
the
gods
in
the
citadel
of
byrsa
in
view
of
the
foregoing
facts
drawn
from
accredited
histories
the
reader
will
readily
concede
that
the
tradition
of
the
miraculous
conceptions
of
gods
sons
of
god
saviors
and
messiahs
was
very
prevalent
in
the
world
at
a
very
ancient
period
of
time
and
long
before
the
mother
of
jesus
was
overshadowed
by
the
most
high
indeed
says
higgins
the
belief
in
the
immaculate
conception
extended
to
every
nation
in
the
world
and
grote
referring
to
greece
makes
the
remarkable
declaration
that
the
furtive
pregnancy
of
young
women
often
by
a
god
is
one
of
the
most
frequently
recurring
incidents
in
the
legendary
narratives
of
the
country
and
we
find
that
both
the
prevalency
and
great
antiquity
of
the
doctrine
of
the
immaculate
conception
among
the
heathen
is
conceded
by
christian
writers
themselves
of
former
ages
in
their
attempts
to
find
arguments
and
commendatory
precedents
to
justify
their
own
belief
in
the
doctrine
for
proof
of
this
we
need
only
cite
the
christian
writer
bailey
who
remarks
what
i
have
said
of
augustine
is
applicable
also
to
origen
and
lactanius
who
have
endeavored
to
persuade
us
of
the
immaculate
virginity
of
the
mother
of
jesus
christ
by
the
example
of
similar
events
stored
by
the
heathen
here
we
have
several
christian
authorities
cited
by
another
writer
also
a
christian
for
placing
the
doctrine
of
the
immaculate
conception
among
the
heathen
legends
in
ages
long
anterior
to
christ
with
respect
to
the
degree
of
credence
to
be
attached
to
the
story
of
the
immaculate
conception
of
the
mother
of
jesus
it
need
only
be
observed
that
there
was
no
other
person
concerned
in
the
transaction
but
herself
who
could
possess
positive
absolute
knowledge
of
the
parentage
and
she
let
it
be
noted
settles
the
matter
forever
by
virtually
affirming
that
joseph
was
his
father
in
the
declaration
addressed
to
jesus
when
she
found
him
in
the
temple
and
thy
have
sought
thee
sorrowing
luke
ii
no
one
will
dispute
that
the
father
here
spoken
of
was
joseph
which
amounts
to
a
positive
declaration
by
the
mother
that
joseph
was
jesus
father
immaculate
conception
and
miraculous
birth
of
the
christian
savior
the
following
considerations
exhibit
some
of
the
numerous
absurdities
involved
in
the
story
of
the
miraculous
birth
of
jesus
christ
the
evangelical
narratives
show
that
christ
himself
did
not
claim
to
have
a
miraculous
birth
he
did
not
once
allude
to
such
an
event
while
if
as
christians
claim
it
is
the
principal
evidence
of
his
deityship
he
certainly
would
have
done
so
his
paternal
genealogy
as
made
out
by
matthew
and
luke
completely
disproves
the
story
of
his
miraculous
conception
by
a
virgin
for
they
both
trace
his
lineage
through
joseph
which
they
could
not
do
only
on
the
assumption
that
joseph
was
his
father
this
of
course
disproves
his
sireship
by
the
holy
ghost
ergo
the
miraculous
conception
it
is
the
lineage
and
parentage
of
joseph
and
not
mary
that
is
given
in
tracing
back
his
ancestry
to
the
royal
household
a
fact
which
completely
overthrows
the
story
of
his
miraculous
birth
and
the
fact
that
his
philip
declared
him
to
be
the
of
and
that
several
texts
show
that
it
was
the
current
impression
is
still
further
confirmation
of
the
conclusion
we
find
the
story
of
the
immaculate
conception
resting
entirely
upon
the
slender
foundation
comprised
in
the
legends
of
an
angel
and
a
dream
we
are
told
that
mary
got
it
by
an
angel
and
joseph
by
a
dream
and
through
these
sources
we
have
the
whole
groundwork
and
foundation
of
the
story
of
the
divinity
of
jesus
christ
it
should
be
noticed
that
we
have
neither
joseph
nor
mary
report
of
these
things
but
only
matthew
and
luke
version
of
the
affair
and
we
are
not
informed
that
either
of
them
ever
saw
or
conversed
with
joseph
or
mary
on
the
subject
it
is
probable
they
got
it
from
dame
rumor
with
her
thousand
tongues
if
christ
were
a
miraculously
born
god
is
it
possible
his
mother
would
have
reproved
him
for
misconduct
when
she
found
him
in
the
temple
as
she
must
have
known
his
character
if
mary
was
miraculously
conceived
why
was
the
important
secret
kept
so
long
from
joseph
why
did
she
keep
the
wool
drawn
over
his
eyes
till
an
angel
had
to
be
sent
from
heaven
to
let
him
into
the
secret
if
she
were
a
woman
why
did
she
thus
attempt
to
deceive
him
why
did
not
god
inform
joseph
by
inspiration
instead
of
employing
the
roundabout
way
of
sending
an
angel
to
do
it
we
are
told
that
mary
was
found
with
child
of
the
holy
ghost
but
as
we
are
not
informed
who
found
it
out
or
who
made
the
discovery
or
how
it
was
made
is
it
not
thus
left
in
a
very
suspicious
aspect
as
the
whole
affair
seems
to
have
been
based
on
dreams
and
was
carried
on
through
dreams
and
has
no
better
foundation
than
dreams
why
should
we
consider
it
entitled
to
any
better
credit
than
similar
stories
found
in
works
on
heathen
mythology
and
would
it
not
prove
that
christianity
is
rather
a
dreamy
religion
should
not
the
astounding
and
incredible
report
of
the
birth
of
a
god
be
based
on
a
better
foundation
than
that
of
dreams
and
angels
and
the
legends
of
oriental
mythology
to
entitle
it
to
the
belief
of
an
intelligent
and
scientific
age
or
can
any
man
of
science
entertain
for
a
moment
the
superlative
solecism
of
an
infinite
god
by
any
special
act
overshadowing
a
finite
human
female
especially
as
modern
science
teaches
us
that
god
is
both
male
and
female
and
as
much
one
as
the
other
as
history
teaches
us
the
ancient
orientalists
believed
that
sexual
commerce
is
sinful
and
contaminating
to
the
child
thus
begotten
and
born
and
hence
had
their
incarnate
gods
sent
into
the
world
through
human
virgins
can
any
unbiased
mind
resist
the
conviction
that
this
is
the
source
of
the
origin
of
the
story
of
christ
immaculate
conception
and
finally
if
it
were
necessary
for
christ
to
come
into
the
world
in
such
a
way
as
to
avoid
the
impure
channel
of
human
conception
and
parturition
why
did
he
not
descend
directly
from
heaven
in
person
why
could
he
not
descend
on
the
clouds
by
his
first
advent
as
the
bible
says
he
will
do
when
he
makes
his
second
advent
would
not
this
course
have
furnished
a
hundred
fold
more
convincing
proof
and
demonstration
of
his
divine
power
and
divine
attributes
than
the
ridiculous
story
and
inscrutable
mystery
of
the
divine
conception
which
is

so
common
that

issued

of

young
women
who
should
offer

an
insult
to

as
to
lay
to
him

kenrick

with

in

arms
may
now
be
seen
represented
in
sculpture
on
some
of
the
ancient
ruined

of
that
ruined
empire
and
higgins
makes
the
broad
declaration
that
the
worship
of
this
virgin
mother
with
her
child
prevailed
everywhere
this
author
also
quotes
riquord
as
saying
this
son
of
god
was
exhibited
in
effigy
lying
in
a
manger
in
the
same
manner
the
infant
jesus
was
afterward
laid
in
the
cave
at
bethlehem
higgins
further
testifies
that
the
worship
of
this
virgin
that
is
the
god
and
the
mother
is
of
very
ancient
date
and
universal
prevalence
in
all
the
eastern
countries
as
is
proved
by
sculptured
figures
bearing
the
marks
of

in
corroboration
of
this
statement
we
might

held
to

even
after
she
had
given

to

children
besides
the

another
striking
parallel

as
she
was
still
called
a
virgin
after
she
had
given

to

and
his

it
is
an
incident
worth

that
in

the

he
who
hath
ears
to
hear
let
him
hear
and
treasure
up
these
facts
according
to
chinese
history
there
were
two
beings
tien
and
worshiped
in
that
country
as
gods
more
than
hundred
years
ago
born
of
virgins
who
knew
no
man
the
mother
of
the
mighty
and
the
almighty
god
hercules
we
are
told
knew
only
jove
if
history
and
tradition
then
are
to
be
credited
god
had
many
well
beloved
sons
born
of
pious
and
holy
virgins
besides
jesus
christ
and
some
of
them
are
represented
as
being
his
only
begotten
and
others
his
first
begotten
sons
and
all
these
cases
appear
to
be
equally
as
well
authenticated
as
the
story
of
jesus
christ
all
stand
upon
a
level
the
same
kind
and
the
same
amount
of
evidence
being
offered
in
each
case
here
we
will
note
it
as
a
curious
circumstance
that
several
of
the
saviors
are
represented
as
being
black
jesus
christ
included
with
this
number
there
is
as
much
evidence
that
the
christian
savior
was
a
black
man
or
at
least
a
dark
man
as
there
is
of
his
being
the
son
of
the
virgin
mary
or
that
he
once
lived
and
moved
upon
the
earth
and
that
evidence
is
the
testimony
of
his
disciples
who
had
nearly
as
good
an
opportunity
of
knowing
what
his
complexion
was
as
the
evangelists
who
omit
to
say
anything
about
it
in
the
pictures
and
portraits
of
christ
by
the
early
christians
he
is
uniformly
represented
as
being
black
and
to
make
this
the
more
certain
the
red
tinge
is
given
to
the
lips
and
the
only
text
in
the
christian
bible
quoted
by
orthodox
christians
as
describing
his
complexion
represents
it
as
being
black
solomon
declaration
i
am
black
but
comely
o
ye
daughters
of
jerusalem
sol
i
is
often
cited
as
referring
to
christ
according
to
the
bible
itself
then
jesus
christ
was
a
black
man
let
us
suppose
that
at
some
future
time
he
makes
his
second
advent
to
the
earth
as
some
christians
anticipate
he
will
do
and
that
he
comes
in
the
character
of
a
sable
messiah
how
would
he
be
received
by
our
christians
of
sensitive
olfactory
nerves
would
they
worship
a
negro
god
let
us
imagine
he
enters
one
of
our
fashionable
churches
with
his
rough
and
ready
seamless
garment
on
made
of
wild
thus
presenting
a
very
forbidding
appearance
and
what
would
be
the
result
would
the
sexton
show
him
to
a
seat
would
he
not
rather
point
to
the
door
and
exclaim
get
out
of
here
no
place
here
for
niggers
what
a
ludicrous
series
of
ideas
is
thus
suggested
by
the
thought
that
jesus
christ
was
a
darkey
and
the
tradition
of
divine
saviors
being
born
of
undefiled
and
undeflowered
virgins
has
an
astronomical
chapter
we
must
not
omit
to
notice
the
virgin
with
her
child
was
pictured
imaginarily
in
the
heavens
from
time
immemorial
they
are
represented
on
the
hindoo
zodiac
at
least
three
thousand
years
old
and
on
the
ancient
egyptian
planispheres
and
if
you
will
examine
burritt
geography
of
the
heavens
you
will
find
the
infant
the
sun
is
represented
as
being
born
into
a
new
year
on
the
of
december
the
very
date
assigned
for
christ
birth
and
may
be
seen
rising
over
the
eastern
horizon
out
of
mary
maria
or
mare
the
latin
for
with
the
infant
god
in
her
arms
being
heralded
and
preceded
by
a
bright
star
which
rises
immediately
preceding
the
virgin
and
her
child
thus
suggesting
the
text
we
have
seen
his
star
in
the
east
and
have
come
to
worship
him
matt
such
facts
led
the
learned
alphonso
to
exclaim
the
adventures
of
jesus
christ
are
all
depicted
among
the
stars
and
such
facts
fasten
the
conviction
on
our
mind
that
the
stories
of
gods
cohabiting
with
young
maids
or
virgins
and
begetting
other
gods
is
of
astrological
origin
the
story
of
jesus
christ
included
a
critical
research
shows
that
astronomy
and
religion
were
interblended
interwoven
and
confounded
together
at
a
very
early
period
of
time
so
indissolubly
that
it
now
becomes
impossible
to
separate
them

stars
point
out
the
time
and
the
saviors
profusion
of
evidence
is
furnished
at
every
step
along
the
devious
pathway
of
sacred
history
tending
to
show
that
all
the
systems
of
worship
which
have
existed
in
the
past
have
had
a
dip
in
the
halo
of
the
heavenly
orbs
and
hence
shine
with
a
light
derived
from
that
source
we
find
the
stars
acting
directly
a
conspicuous
part
at
the
births
of
several
of
the
saviors
besides
figuring
in
some
cases
by
marking
important
events
in
their
subsequent
history
higgins
remarks
that
among
the
ancients
there
seems
to
have
been
a
very
general
idea
that
the
arrival
of
gods
and
great
personages
who
were
expected
to
come
would
be
announced
by
a
star
and
the
cases
of
abraham
caesar
pythagoras
yu
chrishna
and
christ
may
be
cited
in
proof
of
this
declaration
a
star
figured
either
before
or
at
the
birth
of
each
according
to
their
respective
histories
and
it
is
a
historical
fact
that
should
be
noted
here
that
the
practice
of
calculating
nativities
by
the
stars
was
in
vogue
in
the
era
and
country
of
christ
birth
and
had
been
for
a
long
period
previously
in
various
countries
we
have
seen
his
star
in
the
east
and
have
come
to
worship
him

disclosing

unmistakable
astrological
features

in
his
origin
of

vol
ii
reports
zoroaster
as
prophetically
announcing
to
the
wise
men
of
that
country
that
a
savior
would
be
born
attended
by
a
star
at
noonday
for
a
fuller
exposition
of
this
case
see
chapter
ii
in
the
history
of
the
hindoo
savior
chrishna
we
are
told
that
as
soon
as
nared
who
having
heard
of
his
fame
had
examined
the
stars
he
declared
him
to
be
from
god
the
son
of
god
the
roman
calcidius
speaks
of
a
wonderful
star
presaging
the
descent
of
a
god
amongst
men
see
maurice
indian
skeptics
refuted
p
quite
suggestive
of
the
star
apprising
the
wise
men
of
christ
descent
from
above
and
a
star
is
said
to
have
foretokened
the
birth
of
the
roman
julius
cæsar
the
chinese
god
yu
was
not
only
heralded
by
a
star
but
conceived
and
brought
to
mortal
birth
by
a
star
in
numbers
xxiv
it
is
declared
there
shall
come
a
star
out
of
jacob
etc
this
is
a
text
often
quoted
by
christian
writers
as
having
a
prophetic
reference
to
the
christian
messiah
but
the
same
text
declares
further
it
shall
destroy
the
children
of
seth
a
prediction
which
no
rational
interpretation
can
make
apply
to
jesus
christ
and
then
we
find
this
star
of
jacob
or
judah
the
same
represented
on
astronomical
maps
as
a
prominent
star
in
the
constellation
virgo
the
virgin
fancifully
termed
by
the
hebrew
ephraim
it
was
known
in
the
syrian
arabian
and
persian
systems
of
astronomy
as
messaeil
suggestive
of
messiah
and
was
considered
the
ruling
genius
of
the
constellation
the
star
of
jacob
then
was
simply
a
figure
borrowed
from
the
ancient
pagan
systems
of
astronomy
in
which
they
fancifully
represent
a
virgin
rising
with
an
infant
messiah
messaeil
in
her
arms
messaeil
is
when
analyzed
and
is
found
in
the
constellation
virgo
which
commences
rising
at
midnight
on
the
of
december
with
this
star
in
the
east
in
her
arms
the
star
which
piloted
the
wise
men
the
whole
thing
then
is
evidently
an
astronomical
legend
albert
the
great
in
his
book
on
the
universe
tells
us
the
sign
of
the
celestial
virgin
rises
above
the
horizon
at
the
moment
we
find
fixed
for
the
birth
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
to
which
we
will
add
the
declaration
of
sir
william
drummond
who
in
his
odipus
judaicus
most
significantly
remarks
the
anointed
of
the
male
infant
who
rises
in
the
arms
of
virgo
was
called
jesus
by
the
hebrews
and
was
hailed
as
the
anointed
king
or
messiah
still
further
proof
of
the
astrological
origin
of
the
story
hales
in
his
chronology
calls
christ
the
star
of
our
salvation
the
true
apollo
the
sun
of
righteousness
all
of
which
are
astronomical
terms
and
here
we
may
recur
to
the
fact
that
some
of
the
early
inhabitants
of
the
earth
regarded
a
star
as
a
thing
of
life
because
it
appeared
to
move
and
acted
as
though
controlled
by
a
living
spirit
and
this
fetchic
idea
we
observe
lurking
amongst
the
borrowed
orientalisms
of
the
jewish
old
testament
the
representation
of
the
morning
stars
joining
in
a
chorus
and
singing
together
see
job
xxxviii
is
an
instance
of
this
kind
of
fetchic
conception
and
then
we
find
a
much
stronger
and
more
conclusive
case
in
the
new
testament
where
matthew
represents
a
star
as
breaking
loose
from
its
orbit
and
traveling
some
millions
of
miles
in
order
to
stand
over
the
young
child
jesus
as
he
lay
amongst
the
oxen
and
asses
in
a
stable
see
matt
ii
wonderfully
accommodating
star
indeed
how
did
its
inhabitants
feel
while
thus
traveling
with
the
velocity
of
lightning
this
achievement
would
not
only
require
life
but
an
active
intelligence
on
the
part
of
the
star
as
it
is
represented
as
being
an
act
of
the
planet
itself
all
nations
says
higgins
once
believed
that
the
planetary
bodies
or
their
inhabitants
controlled
the
affairs
of
men
and
even
their
births
hence
the
cant
phrases
my
stars
he
is
in
use
then
and
still
in
use
at
the
present
day
the
good
or
ill
luck
of
a
person
was
attributed
to
the
good
or
evil
stars
which
it
was
believed
ruled
at
the
hour
of
his
birth
we
find
a
counterpart
to
the
story
of
matthew
traveling
star
in
virgil
writings
who
declares
that
a
star
guided
æneas
in
a
journey
westward
from
troy
in
the
days
of
pliny
see
his
natural
history
book
ii
the
people
of
rome
fancied
they
saw
a
god
in
a
star
or
comet
in
the
form
of
a
man
the
apocryphal
book
of
seth
relates
that
a
star
descended
from
heaven
and
lighted
on
a
mountain
in
the
midst
of
which
a
divine
child
was
seen
bearing
a
cross
christ
betrays
the
same
ignorance
of
astronomy
when
he
speaks
of
the
stars
falling
from
heaven
to
the
earth
see
matt
xxiv
for
if
there
could
be
any
falling
in
the
case
the
falling
would
be
in
the
other
direction
and
the
earth
would
fall
to
the
stars
as
larger
bodies
always
attract
smaller
ones
as
shown
above
the
stupendous
orbs
of
night
were
represented
by
jew
pagan
and
christian
as
breaking
away
from
their
orbits
and
running
hither
and
thither
like
a
fly
on
a
ceiling
or
a
ball
from
a
being
regarded
as
mere
that
could
appear
anywhere
at
any
time
creative
fancy
might
dictate
or
require
while
science
teaches
that
the
stars
are
stupendous
orbs
some
of
them
a
thousand
times
larger
than
the
planet
on
which
we
live
and
that
they
could
not
depart
one
rod
from
their
accustomed
orbits
without
breaking
up
the
whole
planetary
system
and
destroying
the
universe
and
then
observe
the
absurdity
in
matthew
story
which
teaches
that
the
wise
men
followed
the
star
in
the
east
when
they
coming
from
the
east
were
as
a
matter
of
course
traveling
westward
which
would
place
the
star
to
their
backs
that
must
be
a
pilot
or
guide
which
follows
after
instead
of
going
before
omitting
further
citations
from
history
we
will
only
observe
further
that
the
ancient
hindoos
egyptians
chaldeans
syrians
mexicans
took
great
account
of
stars
and
employed
them
on
all
important
occasions
especially
on
long
journeys
and
at
the
births
of
gods
and
great
personages
a
circumstance
which
aids
in
explaining
the
star
chapter
in
the
gospel
history
of
christ
chapter
vii
angels
shepherds
and
magi
visit
the
infant
saviors
in
an
age
when
gods
and
men
were
on
the
most
familiar
terms
and
when
the
character
of
one
furnished
a
transcript
for
the
other
and
when
each
consented
to
act
a
reciprocal
part
towards
elevating
honoring
and
glorifying
the
other
the
birth
of
a
god
or
messiah
was
as
a
matter
of
course
regarded
as
an
event
of
sufficient
importance
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
great
ones
of
the
earth
and
even
the
denizens
of
heaven
also
and
hence
we
find
it
related
in
the
history
of
several
of
the
saviors
of
antiquity
that
as
soon
as
they
were
born
into
the
world
they
were
visited
by
wise
men
from
a
distance
or
magi
as
they
were
called
by
the
persians
and
brahmins
and
in
some
cases
they
were
likewise
waited
upon
and
adored
by
the
neighboring
shepherds
and
even
celestial
spirits
are
reported
in
some
instances
as
leaving
their
homes
to
wing
their
way
to
the
humble
mansion
the
rude
tenement
containing
a
god
that
they
might
honor
and
adore
the
savior
of
men
the
savior
of
the
world
the
sacred
biographies
of
both
confucius
and
christ
furnish
examples
of
the
angel
host
forsaking
their
golden
pavilions
in
the
skies
to
pay
their
devoirs
to
a
bantling
sent
down
by
the
father
of
mercies
to
save
a
world
and
in
both
cases
the
magi
are
reported
as
assembling
to
present
their
offerings
to
the
infant
god
in
the
case
of
confucius
born
it
is
declared
five
wise
men
from
a
distance
came
to
the
house
celestial
music
was
heard
in
the
skies
and
angels
attended
the
scene
see
the
five
volumes
now
let
us
observe
how
strikingly
similar
to
this
ancient
legend
in
each
of
the
several
characteristics
is
the
christian
story
matthew
ii
speaks
of
wise
men
from
the
east
journeying
to
jerusalem
to
visit
the
infant
christ
soon
after
his
birth
amongst
the
mules
and
oxen
in
a
stable
though
he
omits
to
state
the
number
of
itinerant
adorers
who
presented
themselves
on
the
occasion
the
persian
story
is
more
specific
as
it
gives
the
number
of
magi
who
visited
the
young
savior
of
that
country
as
five
luke
ii
speaks
of
a
multitude
of
the
heavenly
host
praising
god
in
gratulation
of
the
birth
of
the
judean
savior
now
when
we
bear
in
mind
that
one
method
of
praising
god
with
the
orientals
was
by
music
as
we
will
at
once
observe
that
this
is
only
another
mode
of
proclaiming
as
in
the
case
of
confucius
that
celestial
music
was
heard
in
the
skies
and
angels
attended
the
scene
of
confucius
birth
so
likewise
luke
ii
relates
that
the
angels
after
rejoicing
with
the
shepherds
on
the
occasion
of
the
birth
of
christ
went
away
into
heaven
how
complete
the
parallel
and
but
for
the
digression
and
monopoly
of
space
we
might
trace
it
much
further
and
show
that
confucius
like
christ
had
twelve
chosen
disciples
that
he
was
descended
from
a
royal
house
of
princes
as
christ
from
the
royal
house
of
david
that
he
in
like
manner
retired
for
a
long
period
from
the
noise
and
bustle
of
society
into
religious
contemplative
seclusion
that
he
inculcated
the
same
golden
rule
of
doing
to
others
as
we
desire
them
to
act
toward
us
and
other
moral
maxims
equal
in
importance
to
anything
that
can
be
found
in
the
christian
scriptures
etc
but
to
the
line
of
history
other
saviors
at
birth
we
are
told
were
visited
by
both
angels
and
shepherds
also
wise
men
at
least
great
men
chrishna
the
eighth
avatar
of
india
so
it
is
related
by
the
inspired
penman
of
their
pagan
theocracy
was
visited
by
angels
shepherds
and
prophets
avatars
immediately
after
his
birth
he
was
visited
by
a
chorus
of
devatas
angels
and
surrounded
by
shepherds
all
of
whom
were
impressed
with
the
conviction
of
his
future
greatness
we
are
informed
further
that
gold
frankincense
and
myrrh
were
presented
to
him
as
offerings
the
modern
traveler
ditson
who
visited
india
but
a
few
years
since
uses
the
emphatic
declaration
in
fact
as
soon
as
chrishna
was
born
he
was
saluted
by
a
chorus
of
devatas
or
angels
in
the
evangelical
narrative
of
the
christian
savior
an
angel
is
reported
to
have
saluted
his
mother
thus
hail
thou
that
art
highly
favored
the
lord
is
with
thee
blessed
art
thou
among
women
luke
i
and
in
the
next
chapter
the
angel
is
reported
as
joining
with
the
heavenly
host
in
praising
god
a
similar
report
is
found
in
the
hindoo
bible
the
ramayana
appertaining
to
the
mother
of
the
eighth
savior
of
whom
it
is
declared
brahma
and
siva
with
a
host
of
attending
spirits
came
to
her
and
sang
thy
delivery
o
favored
among
women
all
nations
shall
have
cause
to
exult
and
when
the
celestial
infant
chrishna
appeared
it
is
related
in
a
subsequent
chapter
a
chorus
of
heavenly
spirits
saluted
him
with
hymns
the
whole
room
was
illuminated
by
his
light
and
the
countenance
of
his
father
and
mother
shone
with
brightness
and
glory
by
reflection
their
understandings
were
opened
so
that
they
knew
him
to
be
the
preserver
of
the
world
and
they
began
to
worship
him
the
last
text
here
quoted
brings
to
mind
luke
xxiv
which
declares
then
he
christ
opened
their
his
parents
understandings
the
ninth
avatar
of
india
sakia
furnishes
to
some
extent
a
similar
parallel
according
to
the
account
of
an
exploration
made
in
india
and
published
in
the
new
york
correspondent
of
there
is
on
a
silver
plate
in
a
cave
in
india
an
inscription
stating
that
about
the
time
of
the
advent
of
budha
sakia
a
saint
in
the
woods
learned
by
inspiration
that
another
avatar
messiah
or
savior
had
appeared
in
the
house
of
rajah
of
lailas
learning
which
he
flew
through
the
air
to
the
place
and
when
he
beheld
the
savior
he
declared
him
to
be
the
great
avatar
savior
or
prophet
and
that
he
was
destined
to
establish
a
new
religion
the
new
covenant
religion
we
next
draw
on
the
history
of
greece
it
is
authentically
related
of
pythagoras
b
that
his
fame
having
reached
miletas
and
neighboring
cities
men
renowned
for
wisdom
wise
men
came
to
visit
him
progress
of
religious
ideas
vol
i
in
the
anacalypsis
we
are
told
that
magi
came
from
the
east
to
offer
gifts
at
socrates
birth
bringing
gold
frankincense
and
myrrh
the
same
kind
of
offering
as
that
presented
to
the
two
divine
infants
chrishna
and
christ
according
to
their
respective
inspired
biographers
see
matt
ii
and
the
ramayana
and
the
legend
of
mithra
of
persia
might
also
be
included
in
our
category
of
comparison
if
we
had
space
for
it
all
the
four
saviors
last
named
if
socrates
may
be
called
such
are
reported
as
having
been
honored
and
enriched
with
aromatic
offerings
at
their
respective
births
and
we
have
the
statement
from
higgins
that
the
same
assortment
of
spices
with
the
gold
constituted
the
materials
offered
as
gifts
to
the
sun
in
persia
more
than
three
thousand
years
ago
and
likewise
in
arabia
near
the
same
era
and
it
may
be
stated
here
that
an
ancient
historic
account
of
zoroaster
of
persia
according
to
pliny
and
aristotle
speaks
of
his
having
also
been
visited
by
magi
or
magia
at
the
period
of
his
earthly
advent
and
it
is
perhaps
well
to
note
in
this
place
that
magi
is
the
term
used
in
the
apocryphal
gospels
to
designate
the
wise
men
who
visited
christ
at
birth
and
that
magi
magic
and
magician
are
but
variations
of
the
same
word
at
least
derivations
from
the
same
root
all
suggesting
a
wisdom
correlated
to
the
gods
osiris
an
incarnate
deity
of
egypt
we
may
cite
as
another
case
of
an
infantile
god
receiving
signal
honors
and
eclat
at
birth
as
he
was
visited
while
yet
in
the
cradle
by
a
host
of
admiring
adorers
people
flocked
from
all
parts
of
the
world
to
behold
the
infant
such
a
fame
must
have
had
the
effect
to
attract
with
the
numerous
crowd
who
thronged
to
see
and
worship
him
no
small
number
of
wise
men
at
this
stage
of
our
historical
exposition
we
will
suggest
it
as
rather
a
singular
circumstance
that
the
divine
father
in
his
infinite
wisdom
should
have
chosen
to
reveal
the
intelligence
of
the
birth
of
his
son
jesus
christ
to
a
set
of
nomadic
heathen
idolaters
hundreds
of
miles
distant
though
known
as
wise
men
because
of
their
skill
in
astrology
before
he
made
it
known
to
his
own
chosen
people
the
jews
who
had
ever
regarded
themselves
as
the
recipients
of
his
special
favors
and
perhaps
it
is
still
more
singular
that
these
pagan
pedestrians
should
have
been
denominated
wise
men
while
men
of
god
own
election
according
to
the
christian
bible
were
often
stigmatized
and
denounced
as
fools
a
of
vipers
etc
but
it
so
happens
that
human
reason
finds
many
incongruities
in
divine
revelations
chapter
viii
the
of
december
the
birthday
of
the
gods
divested
of
all
explanation
the
announcement
of
the
fact
that
the
time
of
the
birth
of
many
of
the
incarnated
gods
and
saviors
of
antiquity
was
fixed
at
the
same
period
and
this
period
the
of
december
celebrated
all
over
christendom
as
the
birthday
of
jesus
christ
would
sound
marvelously
strange
especially
when
it
is
noticed
that
this
period
formerly
dated
the
birth
of
a
new
year
the
birth
of
king
sol
and
when
we
find
that
the
ancient
pagans
were
in
the
habit
of
celebrating
this
venerated
of
december
as
the
birthday
of
their
gods
in
the
same
manner
christians
now
celebrate
it
as
the
birthday
of
christ
we
are
driven
to
admit
that
something
more
than
mere
fortuitous
accident
must
be
adduced
to
account
for
the
coincidence
according
to
lightfoot
the
temple
of
jerusalem
was
employed
in
celebrating
the
birthday
of
a
pagan
god
adonis
on
the
very
night
christians
assign
for
the
birth
of
christ
and
robert
taylor
informs
us
that
nearly
all
the
nations
of
the
east
were
once
in
the
habit
of
rising
at
midnight
to
celebrate
the
birthday
of
their
gods
on
the
of
december
and
to
this
statement
higgins
adds
that
at
the
first
moment
after
midnight
of
the
of
december
the
ancient
nations
celebrated
the
accouchement
of
the
queen
of
heaven
and
celestial
virgin
and
the
birth
of
the
god

at
midnight
on
the
of

savarana
which
answers
to
our
december
and
millions
of
his
disciples
celebrated
his
birthday
by
decorating
their
houses
with
garlands
and
gilt
paper
and
the
bestowment
of
presents
to
friends
the
rev
barret
tells
us
it
was
once
common
for
the
women
in
rome
to
perambulate
the
streets
on
the
of

singing
in
a
loud
voice
us
a
child
is
born
this
day
the
of
december
then
it
will
be
observed
was
marked
as
the
birthday
of
the
incarnated
gods
saviors
and
sons
of
god
of
many
of
the
religious
systems
of
antiquity
long
prior
to
the
birth
of
christ
and
why
his
birth
was
fixed
at
that
date
is
not
hard
to
account
for
according
to
the
celebrated
christian
writer
goodrich
the
christian
world
had
no
chronology
and
recorded
no
dates
for
several
centuries
after
the
commencement
of
the
christian
era
see
history
of
all
nations
p
no
event
of
their
history
was
marked
by
dates
for
nearly
four
hundred
years
hence
the
time
of
christ
birth
is
altogether
a
matter
of
conjecture
as
is
also
every
other
event
noticed
in
the
christian
bible
this
is
proved
by
the
fact
that
the
ablest
christian
writers
and
chronologists
differ
to
the
extent
of
hundred
years
in
fixing
the
time
of
every
event
in
the
bible
a
kennedy
presents
us
with
three
hundred
different
chronological
systems
by
different
christian
writers
all
founded
on
the
bible
and
proving
that
the
date
of
its
various
events
are
inextricably
involved
in
a
labyrinth
of
doubt
darkness
and
uncertainty
relative
to
the
time
of
christ
birth
the
encyclopedia
britannica
says
christians
count
one
hundred
and
contrary
opinions
of
different
authors
concerning
the
year
the
messiah
appeared
on
earth
many
of
them
celebrated
writers
art
chron
mark
the
declaration
one
hundred
and
different
opinions
as
to
the
year
christ
was
born
in
one
hundred
and
different
years
fixed
on
by
different
christian
chronologists
as
the
time
of
the
birth
of
the
most
extraordinary
and
most
noted
being
as
christians
would
have
us
believe
that
ever
appeared
on
earth
think
of
an
omnipotent
god
descending
from
heaven
performing
astounding
miracles
and
presenting
other
proofs
of
being
a
god
and
yet
not
one
of
the
three
hundred
writers
of
that
era
take
any
notice
of
him
or
make
any
note
of
his
birth
or
any
event
of
his
life
this
circumstance
is
of
itself
sufficient
to
banish
and
dissipate
all
faith
in
his
divinity
it
is
evident
from
the
facts
just
presented
that
all
systems
of
christian
chronology
are
founded
on
mere
conjecture
and
hence
should
be
rejected
as
worthless
what
event
of
christ
life
then
can
be
accepted
as
certain
when
no
record
was
made
of
it
till
the
time
was
forgotten
and
none
for
at
least
half
a
century
after
the
dawn
of
the
christian
era
according
to
lardner
when
nearly
all
who
witnessed
it
must
have
been
dead
we
think
the
most
reasonable
conclusion
in
the
case
is
that
christ
instead
of
performing
those
munchausen
prodigies
attributed
to
him
such
as
casting
out
devils
raising
the
dead
controlling
the
elements
of
nature
led
such
an
ordinary
obscure
life
excelling
only
in
healing
the
sick
and
other
noble
deeds
of
charity
and
philanthropy
that
he
attracted
but
little
notice
by
the
higher
classes
or
by
anybody
but
those
of
a
similar
turn
of
mind
till
he
was
deified
by
constantine
in
the
year
hence
the
time
of
his
birth
was
not
recorded
and
was
forgotten
consequently
the
of
december
was
selected
as
his
birthday
because
it
was
the
birthday
of
other
gods
and
because
it
was
regarded
by
the
heathen
from
time
immemorial
as
the
birthday
of
sol
the
glorious
luminary
of
heaven
it
being
the
period
he
is
born
again
into
a
new
year
and
commences
again
his
journey
and
his
life
and
because
also
this
epoch
was
as
sharon
turner
informs
us
in
his
history
of
the
the
commencement
of
a
new
year
up
to
the
tenth
century
these
events
signalized
the
of
december
and
made
it
a
period
of
sufficient
importance
to
lead
the
early
christians
to
suppose
it
must
have
been
the
birthday
of
their
messiah
mosheim
however
confesses
that
the
day
or
the
year
in
which
it
happened
has
not
been
fixed
with
certainty
notwithstanding
the
profound
researches
of
the
learned
so
that
it
is
still
an
open
question
as
to
when
christ
was
born
what
day
of
the
month
what
year
or
what
century
it
took
place
in
is
still
unknown
this
circumstance
is
as
before
suggested
sufficient
of
itself
to
utterly
prostrate
all
faith
in
the
divine
claims
for
jesus
christ
what
would
be
thought
of
a
witness
who
should
testify
in
court
to
the
truth
of
an
occurrence
of
which
he
did
not
know
the
year
or
even
the
century
in
which
it
took
place
or
who
could
come
no
nearer
than
one
hundred
and
years
in
fixing
or
guessing
at
the
time
would
the
court
accept
such
testimony
chapter
ix
titles
of
the
saviors
the
various
deific
titles
applied
to
jesus
christ
in
the
new
testament
are
regarded
by
some
christian
writers
as
presumptive
evidence
of
his
divinity
but
the
argument
proves
too
much
for
the
case
as
we
find
the
proof
in
history
that
many
other
beings
whom
christians
regard
as
men
were
honored
and
addressed
by
the
same
titles
such
as
god
lord
savior
redeemer
mediator
messiah
etc
the
hindoo
chrishna
more
than
two
thousand
years
ago
was
prayerfully
worshiped
as
god
the
most
high
his
disciple
amarca
once
addressed
him
thus
thou
art
the
lord
of
all
things
the
god
of
the
universe
the
emblem
of
mercy
the
bestower
of
salvation
be
propitious
o
most
high
god
etc
here
he
is
addressed
both
as
lord
and
god
he
is
also
styled
god
of
gods
adonis
of
greece
was
addressed
as
god
supreme
and
osiris
of
egypt
as
the
lord
of
life
in
phrygia
it
was
lord
atys
as
christians
say
lord
jesus
christ
narayan
of
bermuda
was
styled
the
holy
living
god
the
title
son
of
god
was
so
common
in
nearly
all
religious
countries
as
to
excite
but
little
awe
or
attention
st
basil
says
every
uncommonly
good
man
was
called
son
of
god
the
asiatic
researches
says
the
tamulese
adored
a
divine
son
of
god
and
thor
of
the
scandinavians
was
denominated
the
son
of
god
and
so
was
chrishna
of
india
and
other
demigods
it
requires
therefore
a
wide
stretch
of
faith
to
believe
that
jesus
christ
was
in
any
peculiar
sense
the
son
of
god
because
so
denominated
or
the
only
begotten
son
of
god
when
so
many
others
are
reported
in
history
bearing
that
title
the
title
savior
is
found
in
the
legends
of
every
religious
country
so
also
god
redeemer
and
mediator
when
a
mogul
or
thibetan
is
asked
who
is
chrishna
says
the
christian
missionary
hue
the
reply
is
instantly
savior
of
men
budha
was
known
as
the
savior
creator
and
wisdom
of
god
and
mithra
as
both
mediator
and
savior
also
as
the
redeemer
and
chrishna
as
the
divine
redeemer
also
the
redeemer
of
the
world
the
terms
mediator
and
intercessor
were
also
frequently
applied
to
him
by
his
disciples
and
both
he
and
quexalcote
were
hailed
as
the
messiah
in
short
most
ancient
religious
nations
were
honored
with
or
expected
a
messiah
was
jesus
christ
the
lamb
of
god
john
i
so
was
chrishna
styled
the
holy
lamb
the
mexicans
preferring
a
sheep
had
their
ram
of
god
the
celts
had
their
heifer
of
god
and
the
egyptians
their
bull
of
god
all
these
terms
are
ludicrous
emblems
of
deity
representing
him
as
a
quadruped
as
the
title
lamb
of
god
does
jesus
christ
a
term
no
less
ludicrous
than
the
titles
of
the
pagan
gods
as
cited
above
and
was
christ
the
true
light
john
i
so
was
chrishna
likewise
called
the
true
light
also
the
giver
of
light
the
inward
light
etc
osiris
was
the
redeemer
of
light
and
pythagoras
was
both
light
and
truth
apollonius
was
styled
the
true
light
of
the
world
while
simon
magus
was
called
the
light
of
all
men
several
nations
had
also
their
christs
though
in
many
cases
the
word
is
differently
spelled
chrest
the
greek
mode
of
spelling
christ
may
be
found
on
several
of
the
ancient
tombstones
of
that
country
the
christian
writer
elsley
in
his
annotations
of
the
gospels
vol
spells
the
word
christ
in
this
manner
chrest
the
people
of
loretto
had
a
black
savior
called
chrest
or
christ
lucian
in
his
philopatris
admits
the
ancient
gentiles
had
the
name
of
christ
which
shows
it
was
a
heathen
title
the
chaldeans
had
their
chris
the
hindoos
their
chrishna
the
greeks
their
chrest
and
the
christians
their
christ
all
doubtless
derived
from
the
same
original
root
as
for
jesus
it
was
a
common
name
among
the
jews
long
before
the
advent
of
christ
josephus
refers
to
seven
or
eight
persons
by
that
name
as
jesus
brother
of
onias
jesus
son
of
phabet
etc
joshua
in
the
greek
form
jesus
was
in
still
more
common
use
again
was
jesus
christ
the
alpha
and
omega
the
beginning
and
the
end
so
likewise
chrishna
proclaimed
i
am
the
beginning
the
middle
and
the
end
osiris
and
chrishna
were
both
proclaimed
judge
of
the
dead
as
jesus
was
judge
of
quick
and
dead
isaiah
represents
the
father
as
proclaiming
i
am
jehovah
besides
me
there
is
no
savior
isa
xliii
with
what
consistency
then
can
christ
be
called
if
there
is
but
and
that
is
the
father
and
other
divine
titles
besides
those
above
named
in
fact
all
those
applied
to
christ
are
found
used
also
in
reference
to
the
older
pagan
gods
and
hence
prove
nothing
origin
of
the
terms
mediator
intercessor
etc
several
causes
contributed
to
originate
a
belief
in
the
offices
imaginarily
assigned
to
divine
mediators
redeemers
and
intercessors
in
the
first
place
the
great
supreme
god
was
believed
to
be
too
far
off
and
too
aristocratic
to
be
on
familiar
terms
with
his
subjects
or
at
all
times
accessible
to
their
prayers
hence
was
gotten
up
a
mediator
or
middle
god
to
stand
midway
between
the
great
supreme
and
the
people
and
transmit
messages
one
from
the
other
and
thus
serve
as
agent
for
both
parties
confirmatory
of
this
statement
is
the
declaration
of
mamoides
in
his
guide
to
the
erring
that
the
ancient
sabeans
conceived
the
principal
god
on
account
of
his
great
distance
to
be
inaccessible
and
hence
in
imitation
of
the
people
in
their
conduct
toward
their
king
who
had
to
address
him
through
a
person
appointed
for
the
purpose
they
imaginarily
employed
a
middle
divinity
who
was
called
a
mediator
to
present
their
claims
to
the
supreme
god
here
the
whole
secret
is
out
the
whole
thing
is
explained
and
we
now
understand
why
christ
is
called
a
mediator
intercessor
advocate
with
the
father
etc
again
the
supreme
god
was
supposed
to
be
frequently
angry
with
the
people
and
threatening
to
punish
if
not
to
destroy
them
i
will
punish
the
multitude
jer
xlvi
i
will
destroy
the
people
ex
xxiii
hence
this
middle
divinity
this
second
person
of
the
trinity
stepped
in
to
plead
and
intercede
on
their
behalf
being
as
we
must
presume
a
and
more
merciful
being
than
the
father
and
thus
interceding
he
received
the
titles
of
intercessor
and
advocate
with
the
father
john
ii
the
principal
circumstance
however
which
led
to
the
conception
of
a
divine
savior
was
the
desire
to
find
some
way
to
continue
in
sin
and
and
escape
its
natural
and
legitimate
consequences
in
other
words
to
evade
the
penalty
hence
it
came
to
be
believed
that
people
might
run
riot
in
sin
and
plunge
into
the
indulgence
of
their
passions
and
their
lusts
till
the
hour
of
death
approached
when
they
would
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
ask
forgiveness
and
cast
the
burden
of
their
sins
and
sufferings
on
the
merits
of
a
crucified
savior
and
redeemer
who
suffered
once
for
all
that
we
might
escape
and
thus
dodge
the
penalty
for
sin
it
was
as
fleurbach
expresses
it
a
realized
wish
to
be
free
from
the
laws
of
morality
and
escape
the
natural
consequences
of
wrong
doing
chapter
x
the
saviors
of
royal
descent
but
humble
birth
we
have
the
singular
coincidence
presented
in
the
histories
of
several
of
the
saviors
of
their
lineal
descent
through
a
line
of
kings
or
princes
and
yet
commencing
their
probationary
life
under
the
most
humble
and
adverse
circumstances
being
born
in
stables
caves
and
other
inauspicious
situations
the
story
of
their
royal
blood
was
calculated
to
add
dignity
to
their
characters
while
their
humble
birth
in
the
midst
of
poverty
and
unmarked
by
ostentation
would
evince
their
humility
meekness
condescension
and
absence
of
pride
and
thus
proclaim
a
lesson
of
humility
and
resignation
to
their
disciples
and
followers
here
seems
to
be
plainly
indicated
the
motives
for
assigning
them
to
such
a
birth
and
such
a
character
christ
lineal
descent
it
will
be
remembered
is
professedly
traced
though
in
a
very
disjointed
manner
from
the
royal
house
of
david
and
yet
his
royal
blood
did
not
save
him
from
the
most
ignoble
and
ignominious
birth
and
obscure
exordium
of
his
earth
life
a
singular
story
and
yet
a
similar
story
is
told
of
the
indian
savior
chrishna
who
was
according
to
the
rev
allen
india
of
the
royal
house
of
kousa
traced
back
through
many
generations
yet
in
order
to
teach
the
world
a
lesson
of
true
humility
and
administer
a
just
reprehension
to
pride
he
submitted
to
be
born
in
a
cave
amid
the
denizens
of
subterranean
abodes
and
here
let
it
be
noted
the
best
and
most
orthodox
writers
concede
that
while
christ
is
said
to
have
born
in
a
manger
that
manger
was
in
a
cave
fleetwood
a
very
popular
christian
writer
testifies
in
this
matter
that
the
greek
fathers
generally
agree
that
the
place
of
christ
birth
was
a
cave
life
of
christ
p
then
the
coincidence
in
this
respect
between
christ
and
chrishna
may
be
set
down
as
complete
we
have
no
means
of
learning
how
many
of
the
saviors
were
of
royal
blood
as
the
genealogy
of
some
of
them
is
not
given
but
those
whose
lineal
descent
is
furnished
us
are
almost
uniformly
traced
to
or
evinced
as
springing
from
royal
parentage
and
practical
humility
so
far
as
it
can
be
taught
by
an
unostentatious
birth
is
a
lesson
taught
by
nearly
all
budha
sakia
of
hindostan
is
directly
traced
through
a
royal
pedigree
speaking
on
this
point
one
writer
remarks
tradition
affirms
that
his
mother
was
betrothed
to
a
rajah
and
of
course
her
son
belonged
to
the
same
royal
caste
that
chrishna
did
during
his
existence
on
earth
prog
rel
ideas
vol
i
the
great
prophet
of
arabia
mahomet
not
only
commenced
his
earthly
career
in
a
humble
situation
but
resembled
christ
in
having
nowhere
to
lay
his
head
it
is
said
of
the
great
prophet
a
cloak
spread
on
the
ground
served
him
for
a
bed
and
a
skin
filled
with

leaves
was
his
pillow
the
genealogy
of
the
god
yu
of
china
is
traced
through
a
line
of
princes
to
a
very
remote
origin
while
his
whole
life
was
a
lesson
of
practical
humility
and
proclaimed
at
every
step
this
is
the
way
walk
ye
in
it
chapter
xi
christ
genealogy
in
order
to
exalt
the
dignity
and
character
of
the
christian
messiah
still
higher
than
a
mere
claim
for
a
divine
origin
paternally
would
have
the
effect
to
do
two
of
his
assumed
to
be
inspired
biographers
have
set
up
for
him
a
claim
to
a
royal
lineage
through
the
maternal
line
hence
they
tell
us
that
he
descended
from
and
through
a
line
of
kings
embracing
the
house
of
david
but
in
presenting
the
names
and
the
number
of
generations
in
their
attempts
to
make
out
this
royal
distinction
this
kingly
exaltation
of
birth
they
exhibit
a
most
egregious
bungle
and
the
most
barefaced
tissue
of
discrepancies
for
they
not
only
differ
widely
with
each
other
in
this
matter
but
differ
with
the
old
testament
genealogy
and
differ
with
those
texts
which
give
the
maternal
ancestry
of
jesus
indeed
though
varying
as
wide
as
the
poles
from
each
other
they
both
miss
jesus
and
arrive
at
joseph
in
tracing
down
the
generations
from
abraham
unless
we
assume
they
intended
to
represent
joseph
as
being
his
father
luke
in
his
gospel
names
and
counts
off
generations
from
david
to
joseph
though
he
had
previously
represented
it
as
being
but
matthew
says
that
from
abraham
to
david
are
fourteen
generations
but
according
to
his
own
showing
and
according
to
his
own
list
of
names
there
are
but
thirteen
and
then
he
tells
us
there
are
but
fourteen
generations
from
david
to
the
carrying
away
into
babylon
but
according
to
the
old
testament
genealogy
see
i
chron
iii
there
were
eighteen
and
then
the
names
comprised
in
the
two
genealogies
of
matthew
and
luke
are
so
widely
different
from
that
found
in
chronicles
as
to
set
all
analogy
and
agreement
at
defiance
in
fact
in
their
whole
list
of
names
from
david
down
to
joseph
they
only
come
together
twice
their
names
are
all
different
but
two
that
of
salathiel
and
zorobabel
which
names
alone
are
found
in
both
lists
matthew
tells
us
that
the
son
of
david
through
whom
joseph
descended
was
solomon
but
luke
says
it
was
nathan
the
next
name
in
list
is
that
of
roboam
but
the
corresponding
name
in
luke
list
is
mattatha
matthew
next
name
is
abia
which
luke
gives
as
menan
while
chronicles
differs
from
both
and
gives
it
as
abijah
matthew
says
joram
begat
ozias
but
chronicles
virtually
declares
joram
had
no
such
son
although
he
had
a
uzziah
but
luke
says
in
effect
there
was
no
such
person
in
the
genealogical
tree
or
family
line
as
either
joram
ozias
or
uzziah
matthew
says
again
josias
begat
jechonias
and
his
brethren
about
the
time
they
were
carried
away
to
babylon
matt
i
ii
but
chronicles
declares
that
jechonias
was
jehoiakim
son
and
not
josiah
and
that
josiah
had
no
such
son
and
besides
we
learn
from
kings
that
josiah
was
killed
eleven
years
before
the
exile
to
babylon
and
could
not
well
beget
a
son
after
he
had
been
defunct
a
tenth
of
a
century
matthew
after
naming
generations
as
filling
out
the
line
and
making
it
complete
between
david
and
jacob
concludes
by
saying
and
jacob
begat
joseph
the
husband
of
mary
but
luke
antecedent
to
spinning
out
his
list
to
fourteen
generations
more
than
matthew
making
it
fourteen
generations
longer
declares
that
joseph
was
the
son
of
heli
so
that
joseph
either
had
two
fathers
jacob
and
heli
or
matthew
or
luke
or
both
were
most
egregiously
mistaken
with
all
their
inspiration
again
luke
says
that
salathiel
was
the
son
of
neri
but
chronicles
says
he
was
the
son
of
jechonias
and
after
chronicles
had
registered
zorobabel
as
the
son
of
penniah
matthew
and
luke
assuming
to
become
wise
above
what
was
written
both
declare
that
he
was
the
son
of
salathiel
they
agree
here
in
contradicting
chronicles
which
is
the
only
instance
but
one
of
their
agreement
in
the
whole
list
of
progenitors
from
david
to
joseph
with
this
exception
they
contradict
each
other
all
the
way
through
and
in
many
instances
that
of
chronicles
too
this
is
a
strange
way
indeed
of
proving
jesus
christ
to
have
had
two
fathers
to
be
both
the
son
of
god
and
son
of
david
and
it
is
still
stranger
that
they
should
trace
his
genealogy
to
joseph
if
they
did
not
consider
him
joseph
son
otherwise
the
genealogy
of
sinbad
the
sailor
or
harry
haulaway
would
have
been
as
apropos
such
are
the
beautiful
harmony
and
agreement
in
the
words
of
divine
inspiration
which
christians
prate
so
much
about
and
all
this
appears
to
be
the
result
of
an
attempt
to
elevate
the
man
christ
jesus
to
a
level
with
the
demigods
of
antiquity
nearly
all
of
whom
claimed
to
be
of
royal
or
princely
descent
such
continual
blundering
guessing
and
clashing
of
names
as
is
exhibited
in
the
foregoing
exposition
reminds
us
of
the
reply
when
asked
for
the
number
and
names
of
his
brothers
well
sir
i
have
fourteen
brothers
and
they
are
all
named
bill
but
bob
his
name
is
tom
matthew
and
luke
attempt
to
exalt
and
dignify
the
character
of
christ
by
making
out
for
him
a
pure
holy
and
royal
lineage
we
find
upon
a
critical
examination
not
only
proved
a
very
signal
but
a
very
singular
and
ludicrous
failure
for
all
his
female
anchors
who
are
brought
to
notice
were
persons
of
libidinous
or
licentious
tendencies
according
to
their
own
biblical
history
it
is
remarkable
says
alexander
walker
a
christian
writer
in
his
work
on
woman
that
in
the
genealogy
of
christ
only
four
women
are
named
thamar
who
seduced
the
father
of
her
late
husband
and
rachel
a
common
prostitute
and
ruth
who
instead
of
marrying
one
of
her
cousins
went
to
bed
with
another
of
them
and
bathsheba
an
adulteress
who
espoused
david
the
murderer
of
her
first
husband
what
a
pedigree
for
an
incarnate
god
a
being
ostensibly
of
spotless
origin
though
his
impure
ancestral
origin
does
not
detract
from
the
high
moral
character
and
distinguished
moral
life
which
marks
the
history
of
the
man
christ
jesus
many
incidents
of
whose
life
show
him
to
have
been
what
is
now
known
as
a
spiritual
medium
chapter
xii
the
world
saviors
saved
from
destruction
in
infancy
of
course
such
an
extraordinary
circumstance
as
the
birth
of
a
god
into
the
world
must
be
marked
with
unusual
incidents
and
great
eclat
this
was
first
exhibited
by
angels
shepherds
prophets
magi
or
wise
men
flocking
around
their
cradles
in
the
second
place
we
observe
an
unusual
display
of
divine
power
and
providential
care
on
the
part
of
the
great
father
god
who
was
still
left
in
heaven
to
save
the
young
saviors
through
their
infancy
it
is
certainly
a
remarkable
circumstance
that
so
many
of
the
infant
saviors
should
have
been
threatened
with
the
most
imminent
danger
of
destruction
and
yet
in
every
case
miraculously
preserved
and
thus
were
the
a
jealousy
seems
to
have
existed
in
several
instances
in
the
mind
of
the
tyrant
king
or
ruler
of
the
country
that
the
young
saviors
and
prospective
spiritual
rulers
who
were
mostly
of
royal
descent
would
ultimately
acquire
such
favor
with
the
people
by
such
a
display
of
superior
power
and
greatness
of
mind
as
to
endanger
his
retaining
peaceable
possession
of
the
secular
throne
to
express
it
in
brief
he
feared
the
young
god
would
prove
a
rival
king
and
hence
took
measures
to
destroy
him
in
the
case
of
the
christian
savior
we
are
told
that
an
angel
or
the
angel
warned
joseph
the
assumed
father
to
take
the
young
savior
and
god
and
flee
with
him
into
egypt
because
herod
the
king
sought
to
destroy
the
young
child
life
and
had
in
order
to
effect
this
end
decreed
the
destruction
of
all
the
children
under
two
years
old
and
joseph
heeded
the
divine
warning
and
fled
as
directed
an
angel
and
a
dream
then
it
will
be
observed
were
the
instrumentalities
used
to
save
the
young
judean
savior
from
massacre
and
strange
as
it
may
seem
we
find
the
same
agencies
had
been
previously
employed
to
effect
the
rescue
of
other
saviors
likewise
and
similarly
threatened
in
the
case
of
chrishna
of
india
in
particular
the
similitude
is
very
striking
in
nearly
every
feature
of
the
whole
story
in
the
first
place
there
is
the
angel
warning
in
the
christian
story
we
are
not
specifically
informed
how
the
tyrant
herod
first
became
apprised
of
the
birth
of
the
judean
savior
the
hindoo
story
is
fuller
and
indicates
that
the
angel
was
not
only
sufficiently
thoughtful
to
warn
the
parents
to
flee
from
a
danger
which
threatened
to
dispossess
them
of
a
divine
child
and
the
world
of
a
savior
but
was
condescending
enough
to
apprise
the
tyrant
ruler
cansa
of
his
danger
likewise
as
we
are
told
he
heard
an
angel
voice
announcing
that
a
rival
ruler
was
born
in
his
kingdom
and
hence
like
herod
he
set
about
concocting
measures
to
destroy
him
without
a
direct
attack
why
either
of
them
should
have
taken
such
a
circuitous
or
roundabout
way
of
killing
an
infant
when
the
life
of
the
strongest
man
and
every
man
in
their
kingdoms
was
at
their
instant
disposal
divine
inspiration
does
not
inform
us
but
so
it
was
and
we
must
not
seek
to
become
wise
above
what
is
written
in
their
bibles
herod
decree
required
the
destruction
of
all
infants
under
two
years
of
age
see
matt
ii
first
ordering
however
go
and
search
diligently
for
the
young
child
matt
ii
cansa
decree
ran
thus
let
active
search
be
made
for
whatever
young
children
there
may
be
upon
earth
and
let
every
boy
in
whom
there
may
be
found
signs
of
unusual
greatness
be
slain
without
remorse
now
let
it
be
specially
noticed
that
there
is
to
this
day
in
the
cave
temple
at
elephanta
in
india
the
sculptured
likeness
of
a
king
represented
with
a
drawn
sword
and
surrounded
with
slaughtered
infants
admitted
by
all
writers
to
be
much
older
than
christianity
mr
forbes
in
his
oriental
memories
vol
iii
says
the
figures
of
the
slaughtered
infants
in
the
cave
of
elephanta
represent
them
as
being
all
boys
who
are
surrounded
by
groups
of
figures
of
men
and
women
in
the
act
apparently
of
supplicating
for
those
children
and
higgins
testifies
relative
to
the
case
that
chrishna
was
carried
away
by
night
and
concealed
in
a
region
remote
from
his
natal
place
for
fear
of
a
tyrant
whose
destroyer
it
had
been
foretold
he
would
become
who
for
that
reason
had
ordered
all
the
male
children
born
at
that
time
to
be
slain
sculptures
in
elephanta
attest
the
story
where
the
tyrant
is
represented
as
destroying
the
children
the
date
of
this
sculpture
is
of
the
most
remote
antiquity
he
who
hath
ears
to
hear
let
him
hear
and
deduce
the
pregnant
inference
joseph
and
mary
fled
with
the
young
judean
god
into
egypt
chrishna
parents
likewise
fled
with
the
young
hindoo
savior
to
gokul
now
let
us
observe
for
a
moment
the
chain
or
category
or
resemblance
there
was
an
angel
warning
in
each
case
relative
to
the
impending
danger
the
governor
or
ruler
was
hostile
in
each
case
to
the
mission
of
the
young
savior
a
bloody
decree
was
issued
in
both
cases
having
for
its
object
the
destruction
of
these
infant
messiahs
the
hurried
flight
of
the
parents
takes
place
in
each
case
and
it
may
be
remarked
further
that
the
gospel
of
the
infancy
of
jesus
once
believed
by
the
christian
world
to
be
inspired
and
which
for
hundreds
of
years
passed
current
as
divine
authority
relates
that
christ
and
his
parents
sojourned
for
a
time
at
a
place
called
matarea
or
mathura
as
sir
william
jones
spells
it
who
says
it
was
the
birth
place
of
chrishna
it
is
further
related
in
the
case
of
chrishna
that
as
he
and
his
parents
approached
the
river
jumna
in
their
flight
the
waters
parted
hither
and
thither
so
that
they
passed
over
dry
shod
like
moses
and
the
israelites
in
crossing
the
red
sea
and
here
let
it
be
noted
that
the
representation
of
this
flight
which
is
said
to
have
occurred
at
midnight
is
like
that
of
the
massacre
perpetuated
and
attested
by
imperishable
monuments
of
stone
bearing
evidence
of
being
now
several
thousand
years
old
sir
william
jones
says
the
indian
incarnate
god
chrishna
the
hindoos
believe
had
a
virgin
mother
of
the
royal
race
who
was
sought
to
be
destroyed
in
his
infancy
about
nine
hundred
years
before
christ
it
appears
that
he
passed
his
life
in
working
miracles
and
preaching
and
was
so
humble
as
to
wash
his
friends
feet
at
length
dying
but
rising
from
the
dead
he
ascended
into
heaven
in
the
presence
of
a
multitude
the
cingalese
relate
nearly
the
same
things
of
their
budha
and
several
authors
of
egyptian
history
refer
to
a
story
perpetuated
in
the
egyptian
legends
concerning
the
god
osiris
who
was
threatened
with
destruction
by
the
tyrant
amulius
to
save
whom
his
parents
fled
and
concealed
him
in
an
arm
of
the
river
nile
as
christ
was
concealed
in
the
same
country
and
for
aught
that
appears
to
the
contrary
in
the
same
locality
the
mother
of
another
and
older
savior
of
egypt
fled
by
a
timely
warning
to
epidamis
before
the
birth
of
the
divine
child
and
was
there
delivered
of
our
lord
and
savior
horus
and
the
earthly
or
adopted
father
of
the
grecian
savior
and
god
alcides
had
to
flee
with
him
and
his
mother
to
galem
for
protection
from
threatening
danger
in
the
ninth
and
tenth
volumes
of
the
asiatic
researches
we
find
the
story
of
the
only
begotten
or
first
begotten
son
of
god
salvahana
of
cape
comorin
son
of
a
virgin
mother
as
were
all
the
other
saviors
referred
to
and
a
carpenter
by
the
name
of
taishnea
it
will
be
remembered
that
joseph
of
jesus
was
a
carpenter
the
story
of
this
son
of
god
presents
several
features
very
similar
to
that
relating
to
jesus
sir
william
jones
colonel
wilford
and
the
rev
maurice
all
confess
to
the
antiquity
of
this
story
as
originating
before
the
birth
of
christ
speaking
of
zoroaster
of
persia
another
case
an
author
remarks
tradition
reports
that
his
mother
had
alarming
dreams
of
evil
spirits
seeking
to
destroy
the
child
to
whom
she
was
about
to
give
birth
but
a
good
spirit
came
to
rescue
him
and
consoled
her
by
saying
not
god
ormuzd
will
protect
the
infant
who
has
sent
him
as
a
prophet
to
the
people
and
the
world
who
are
waiting
for
him
china
too
presents
us
with
a
case
of
the
threatened
destruction
of
a
savior
in
infancy
evidently
recorded
more
than
two
thousand
five
hundred
years
ago
it
is
the
case
of
the
god
yu
who
was
concealed
in
a
manner
similar
to
that
of
moses
a
commemoration
of
the
story
of
which
is
perpetuated
by
an
image
or
picture
of
the
virgin
mother
with
a
babe
upon
her
knee
sometimes
in
her
arms
now
let
it
be
noted
that
these
gods
who
we
are
told
came
to
save
the
world
could
not
save
themselves
but
had
to
be
protected
and
saved
by
other
gods
without
pursuing
the
subject
further
in
detail
we
may
mention
by
way
of
recapitulation
that
chrishna
alcides
zoraster
salvahana
yu
to
which
list
we
may
add
bacchus
romulus
moses
and
cyrus
according
to
their
reputed
history
were
threatened
with
death
and
destruction
but
were
providentially
and
miraculously
preserved
the
case
of
augustus
is
related
by
suetonius
that
of
romulus
by
livy
and
that
of
cyrus
by
herodotus
it
will
be
recollected
that
pharaoh
like
herod
in
order
to
reach
the
infant
moses
ordered
the
massacre
of
all
the
male
infants
herod
making
no
distinction
of
sex
in
order
that
he
might
by
this
singular
and
circuitous
method
reach
the
object
of
his
jealousy
and
malignity
without
passing
a
direct
sentence
of
death
upon
him
the
whole
story
of
herod
slaughter
edict
with
the
familiar
history
of
its
execution
like
nearly
every
other
miraculous
incident
related
in
the
holy
scriptures
which
detail
their
histories
are
traceable
in
the
skies
herod
we
are
told
literally
means
hero
of
the
skin
a
term
applied
also
to
hercules
a
personification
of
the
sun
because
the
sun
on
entering
the
constellation
of
the
zodiac
in
july
was
supposed
or
assumed
to
invest
himself
with
the
skin
of
the
lion
and
this
became
the
hero
of
the
skin
or
a
hero
with
a
new
skin
now
this
solar
herod
passing
through
the
astronomical
twins
and
young
infants
of
may
was
said
to
destroy
them
though
the
word
destroy
is
in
the
greek
anairean
which
any
person
on
turning
to
the
greek
lexicon
will
observe
means
also
to
take
away
pass
through
or
withdraw
from
so
that
pharaoh
more
properly
passed
through
the
infants
than
destroyed
them
the
text
in
rama
there
was
a
voice
heard
rachel
weeping
for
her
children
is
quoted
by
a
writer
strauss
as
referring
to
the
children
slaughtered
by
pharaoh
let
two
things
be
noticed
here
rama
is
the
indian
and
phoenician
name
for
the
zodiac
rachel
had
but
two
children
to
weep
for
joseph
and
benjamin
just
the
number
found
in
the
fifth
sign
or
may
sign
of
the
zodiac
and
venus
among
the
ancient
assyrians
and
phoenicians
was
in
tears
when
the
sun
in
his
annual
cross
through
the
heavens
passed
through
or
over
the
astronomical
twins
gemini
doubtless
fearfully
apprehending
their
destruction
the
case
of
the
massacre
is
an
illustration
and
example
of
the
manner
in
which
all
the
miraculous
stories
related
in
the
christian
scriptures
as
having
been
practically
exemplified
in
the
life
of
jesus
christ
are
traceable
to
older
sources
frequently
terminating
among
the
stars
section
incredibility
of
the
story
of
the
massacre
of
the
hebrew
infants
it
is
a
cogent
and
potent
fact
calculated
to
render
the
story
of
the
murder
of
the
hebrew
children
by
herod
wholly
incredible
that
not
one
writer
of
that
age
or
that
nation
or
any
other
nation
makes
any
mention
of
the
circumstance
even
the
rabbinical
writers
who
detail
his
wicked
life
so
minutely
and
who
bring
to
his
charge
so
many
flagitious
acts
fail
to
record
any
notice
of
this
horrible
and
atrocious
deed
which
must
have
been
published
far
and
wide
and
known
to
all
the
writers
of
that
age
and
country
had
it
occurred
and
still
more
logically
ruinous
to
the
credit
of
the
story
is
the
omission
of
josephus
to
throw
out
one
hint
that
such
a
wholesale
slaughter
ever
took
place
in
judea
and
yet
he
not
only
lived
in
that
country
but
was
related
to
herod
wife
and
regarded
him
as
his
most
implacable
enemy
and
professes
to
write
out
the
whole
history
of
his
wicked
life
in
the
most
minute
detail
devoting
chapters
of
his
large
work
to
this
subject
and
apparently
enumerates
every
evil
act
of
his
life
and
yet
josephus
says
not
a
word
about
his
inhuman
and
infamous
butchery
of
the
babes
which
matthew
charges
him
with
about
fourteen
thousand
in
number
a
bloody
deed
unmatched
in
the
annals
of
tyranny
such
facts
prove
the
story
not
only
incredible
but
impossible
josephus
could
not
and
would
not
have
omitted
to
notice
this
the
most
notorious
and
nefarious
act
of
his
life
had
it
occurred
it
therefore
could
not
have
occurred
and
it
is
almost
equally
incredible
that
roman
historians
who
furnish
us
with
a
particular
account
of
character
should
pass
over
in
silence
such
a
villainous
and
bloody
deed
and
then
some
of
our
ablest
and
most
reliable
chronologists
have
shown
that
herod
was
not
living
at
the
time
this
bloody
decree
should
have
been
issued
by
him
that
he
died
about
three
years
prior
to
that
period
and
hence
could
have
been
guilty
of
no
such
villainy
and
highhanded
murder
and
cruel
infanticide
and
even
if
living
he
would
have
been
an
old
man
not
less
than
according
to
josephus
hence
he
could
not
have
calculated
on
surviving
long
enough
for
the
son
of
a
village
carpenter
then
a
babe
to
oust
him
from
his
throne
it
is
wholly
incredible
also
that
herod
should
have
adopted
such
a
roundabout
method
of
destroying
the
object
of
his
fear
and
envy
when
he
could
have
singled
him
out
and
put
him
to
death
at
once
and
thus
avoid
the
felonious
act
of
breaking
the
hearts
of
thousands
of
parents
and
his
most
loyal
subjects
too
from
the
foregoing
considerations
we
endorse
the
sentiment
of
the
rev
edward
evanson
that
it
is
an
incredible
borrowed
fiction
chapter
xiii
the
saviors
exhibit
early
proofs
of
divinity
of
course
all
gods
must
be
heroes
physically
or
intellectually
or
both
the
more
danger
they
encounter
and
the
earlier
they
manifest
a
precocious
or
preternatural
smartness
the
more
like
gods
and
hence
we
find
several
of
the
saviors
in
very
early
childhood
displaying
great
physical
prowess
in
meeting
and
conquering
danger
while
others
exhibit
their
superiority
mentally
by
vanquishing
their
opponents
in
argument
christ
first
began
to
exhibit
proof
of
his
divine
character
and
greatness
by
meeting
and
silencing
the
doctors
in
the
temple
when
only
about
twelve
years
of
age
and
similar
proofs
of
divinity
at
or
near
this
age
is
found
in
the
history
of
some
of
the
pagan
saviors
of
christ
it
is
declared
there
went
out
a
fame
of
him
through
all
the
region
round
about
luke
iv
and
of
the
grecian
esculapius
it
is
likewise
declared
the
voice
of
fame
soon
published
the
birth
of
a
miraculous
child
and
the
people
flocked
from
all
quarters
to
behold
him
of
confucius
of
china
it
is
declared
his
extensive
knowledge
and
great
wisdom
soon
made
him
known
and
kings
were
governed
by
his
counsels
and
the
people
adored
him
wherever
he
went
and
it
is
further
declared
of
this
divine
man
that
he
seemed
to
arrive
at
reason
and
the
perfect
use
of
his
faculties
almost
from
infancy
it
is
reported
of
the
god
that
when
questioned
on
the
subject
of
government
and
the
duties
of
princes
and
rulers
while
yet
a
child
his
answers
were
such
as
to
astonish
the
whole
empire
by
his
knowledge
and
wisdom
it
is
related
of
a
grecian
god
that
he
demolished
the
serpents
which
attempted
to
bite
or
destroy
him
while
in
his
cradle
the
proof
of
osiris
divinity
was
a
blaze
of
light
shining
around
his
cradle
soon
after
he
was
born
relative
to
pythagoras
of
the
same
country
we
have
it
upon
the
authority
of
a
christian
writer
that
he
exhibited
such
a
remarkable
character
even
in
youth
as
to
attract
the
attention
of
all
who
saw
and
heard
him
speak
and
the
author
further
testifies
of
him
that
he
never
was
at
any
time
overcome
with
anger
laughter
or
perturbation
of
mind
or
precipitation
of
conduct
his
fame
having
reached
miletus
and
neighboring
cities
it
is
said
by
another
writer
the
people
flocked
to
see
and
hear
him
and
he
was
reverenced
by
multitudes
luke
declares
of
christ
that
the
people
were
astonished
at
his
understanding
and
answers
luke
ii
and
the
gospel
of
the
infancy
tells
us
that
his
tutor
zacheas
was
astonished
at
his
learning
which
reminds
us
of
the
statement
found
in
the
divine
word
of
the
hindoos
the
mahabarat
that
the
parents
of
the
savior
chrishna
in
making
arrangements
to
give
him
an
education
sent
him
to
a
learned
brahmin
as
tutor
whom
he
instantly
astonished
with
his
vast
learning
and
under
whose
tuition
he
mastered
the
whole
circle
of
sciences
in
a
day
and
a
night
men
seeing
the
wonders
performed
by
this
child
told
nanda
his
adopted
father
that
this
could
not
possibly
be
his
son
it
is
told
of
budha
sakia
of
india
that
as
soon
as
he
was
born
a
light
shone
around
his
cradle
when
he
stood
up
and
proclaimed
his
mission
and
that
the
river
ganges
daring
this
time
rose
in
a
miraculous
manner
which
was
stilled
by
his
divine
power
as
christ
stilled
the
tempest
on
the
sea
he
was
born
says
the
new
american
cyclopedia
vol
iv
amidst
great
miracles
and
soon
as
born
most
solemnly
proclaims
his
mission
of
narayan
the
holy
it
is
declared
that
mysterious
words
dropped
from
his
lips
on
various
occasions
giving
hints
of
his
divine
nature
and
the
purposes
for
which
he
had
come
down
to
the
earth
prog
rel
ideas
vol
p
the
divine
power
and
mission
of
yu
of
china
was
very
early
evinced
by
the
display
of
great
miracles
and
here
let
us
observe
that
some
of
the
old
testament
or
jewish
heroes
as
moses
solomon
and
samuel
are
reported
as
exhibiting
great
superiority
of
mind
in
very
early
life
thus
proving
it
was
thought
that
if
they
were
not
gods
they
were
at
least
from
god
that
is
endowed
by
him
with
divine
power
while
yet
mere
children
thus
the
histories
of
all
gods
and
divine
personages
run
in
parallel
grooves
chapter

the
saviors
kingdoms
not
of
this
world
retirement
and
forty
days
fasting
christ
taught
my
kingdom
is
not
of
this
world
and
we
find
that
most
of
the
other
saviors
virtually
and
practically
taught
the
same
doctrine
the
first
practical
evincement
of
it
was
exhibited
by
retiring
from
the
world
that
is
they
retired
from
the
noise
and
commotion
from
the
busy
scenes
of
life
into
some
sequestered
spot
excluded
from
human
observation
christ
is
reported
to
have
withdrawn
from
society
and
to
have
spent
some
forty
days
in
the
wilderness
fasting
and
being
tempted
by
satan
a
man
of
straw
conjured
up
in
order
to
furnish
the
hero
god
something
to
combat
with
that
he
might
thereby
exhibit
practical
proof
of
his
divine
power
and
prowess
it
was
simply
the
two
kings
or
rulers
of
two
hostile
kingdoms
heaven
and
hell
contending
for
the
mastery
lord
kingsborough
tells
us
the
ancient
mexicans
had
a
forty
days
fast
in
honor
and
memory
of
one
of
their
demigods
or
saviors
who
was
tempted
forty
days
on
a
mountain
he
is
called
morning
star
kingsborough
being
a
christian
remarks
these
things
are
very
curious
and
mysterious
it
is
said
of
the
son
of
god
and
savior
chrishna
that
he
imparted
his
doctrines
and
precepts
in
the
silent
depths
of
the
forest
of
the
egyptian
god
osiris
we
are
informed
in
his
sacred
legends
that
he
observed
both
fasting
and
penance
while
pythagoras
of
greece
spent
several
years
in
meditation
and
retirement
in
a
cave
and
was
much
given
to
fasting
and
often
inculcated
the
doctrine
of
forsaking
the
world
and
the
things
thereof
he
taught
these
things
both
by
precept
and
example
even
to
the
forsaking
of
relations
both
confucius
and
the
divine
savior
of
china
in
order
to
attain
to
a
more
perfect
state
of
holiness
spent
several
years
in
retirement
and
divine
meditation
the
former
in
a
wilderness
the
latter
on
a
mountain
and
fasted
and
their
disciples
after
them
often
fasted
in
a
very
devout
manner
the
persian
zoroaster
also
spent
several
years
in
retirement
and
contemplation
on
true
holiness
partly
in
a
wilderness
and
partly
on
a
holy
mountain
holy
mountains
being
the
favorite
places
of
resort
of
most
of
the
holy
saviors
holy
gods
and
holy
men
of
antiquity
one
of
the
most
ancient
saviors
thammuz
is
reported
to
have
spent
twelve
years
in
devout
and
contemplative
retirement
from
the
busy
world
according
to
the
christian
bible
moses
elijah
and
christ
each
fasted
forty
days
and
a
mexican
savior
too
quexalcote
spent
forty
days
in
a
similar
manner
and
other
cases
are
so
reported
we
may
institute
the
inquiry
here
how
happens
this
coincidence
the
answer
is
indicated
by
the
hierophant
which
says
jesus
in
his
baptism
and
forty
days
fast
imitated
the
passage
of
the
sun
through
the
constellation
aquarius
where
john
joannes
or
janus
the
baptizer
had
his
domicile
and
baptized
the
earth
with
his
yearly
rains
having
been
baptized
in
jordan
he
fasted
forty
days
in
the
wilderness
in
imitation
of
the
passage
of
the
sun
from
the
constellation
aquarius
through
the
fishes
to
the
lamb
or
ram
of
march
during
the
forty
days
when
the
sun
is
among
the
fishes
in
the
sign
of
the
fish
the
faithful
catholics
episcopalians
and
mahommedans
abstain
from
meat
and
live
upon
the
fishes
during
the
season
of
lent
as
did
the
jews
and
pagans
and
did
also
jesus
to
fulfill
all
righteousness
chapter
xv
the
saviors
were
real
personages
it
is
unwarrantably
assumed
by
christian
writers
that
the
incarnated
gods
and
crucified
saviors
of
the
pagan
religions
were
all
either
mere
fabulous
characters
or
ordinary
human
beings
invested
with
divine
titles
and
divine
attributes
while
on
the
other
hand
the
assumption
is
put
forth
with
equal
boldness
that
jesus
christ
was
a
real
divine
personage
seen
and
believed
on
in
the
world
and
finally
crucified
on
mount
calvary
but
we
do
not
find
the
facts
in
history
to
warrant
any
such
assumptions
or
any
such
distinctions
they
all
stand
in
these
respects
upon
the
same
ground
and
on
equal
footing
and
their
respective
disciples
point
to
the
same
kind
of
evidence
to
prove
their
real
existence
and
their
divine
character
and
to
prove
that
they
once
walked
and
talked
amongst
men
as
well
as
now
sit
on
the
eternal
throne
in
heaven
at
the
right
hand
of
the
father
and
we
find
even
christian
writers
admitting
the
once
or
personal
existence
on
earth
of
most
of
the
pagan
saviors
as
to
the
two
chief
incarnated
gods
of
india
chrishna
and
sakia
there
is
scarcely
a
peg
left
to
hang
a
doubt
upon
as
to
the
fact
of
their
having
descended
to
the
earth
taken
upon
themselves
the
form
of
men
and
having
been
worshiped
as
veritable
gods
indeed
we
believe
but
few
of
the
missionaries
who
have
visited
that
country
question
the
statement
and
general
belief
prevalent
there
of
their
once
personal
reality
todd
in
his
history
of
the
rajahs
says
we
must
discard
the
idea
that
the
mahabaret
the
history
of
rama
of
chrishna
and
the
five
padua
brothers
are
mere
allegories
colossal
figures
ancient
temples
and
caves
inscribed
with
characters
yet
unknown
confirm
the
reality
and
their
race
their
cities
and
their
coins
yet
exist
to
argue
further
the
personal
reality
of
this
crucified
god
would
be
a
waste
of
words
as
it
is
generally
admitted
both
by
historical
writers
and
missionaries
higgins
declares
chrishna
lived
at
the
conclusion
of
the
brazen
age
which
is
calculated
to
have
been
eleven
hundred
or
twelve
hundred
years
before
christ
here
is
a
very
positive
and
specific
declaration
as
to
his
tangible
actuality
dow
robinson
and
others
use
similar
language
relative
to
bacchus
of
whose
history
many
writers
have
spoken
as
being
wholly
fabulous
or
fictitious
diodorus
siculus
says
lib
iii
the
libyans
claim
bacchus
and
say
that
he
was
the
son
of
ammon
a
king
of
libya
that
he
built
a
temple
to
his
father
ammon
and
that
famous
historian
goodrich
is
still
more
explicit
if
possible
as
to
his
material
entity
after
giving
it
directly
as
his
opinion
that
there
was
such
a
being
he
says
he
planted
and
and
erected
many
noble
cities
he
moreover
tells
us
his
skill
in
legislation
and
agriculture
is
much
praised
with
respect
to
osiris
of
egypt
another
hittle
declares
unqualifiedly
that
herodotus
saw
the
tomb
of
osiris
at
sais
nearly
five
centuries
before
christ
vol
rather
a
strong
evidence
of
his
previous
personality
certainly
but
not
more
so
than
that
furnished
by
the
york
journal
of
a
few
years
since
relative
to
the
egyptian
apis
or
thulis
whose
theophany
was
annually
celebrated
at
the
rising
of
the
nile
with
great
festivities
and
devotion
several
thousand
years
ago
the
paris
correspondent
of
that
journal
after
speaking
of
auguste
marietta
travels
a
distinguished
scientific
gentleman
who
for
four
years
past
had
been
employed
by
the
french
government
in
making
egyptian
researches
having
returned
home
says
the
most
important
of
marietta
discoveries
was
the
tomb
of
apis
thulis
a
monument
excavated
entirely
in
there
are
he
says
in
conclusion
epitaphs
forming
a
chronological
record
of
each
of
the
apis
buried
in
the
common
tomb
the
sculpture
is
of
the
date
of
the
pyramids
and
the
statues
are
in
the
best
state
of
preservation
the
colors
are
perfectly
bright
the
execution
is
admirable
and
they
convey
an
exact
idea
of
the
physical
character
of
the
primitive
population
the
new
american
cyclopedia
art
apis
in
speaking
of
this
egyptian
god
tells
us
his
lifetime
was
years
in
harmony
with
one
of
the
cycles
of
the
egyptians
the
same
work
and
volume
in
speaking
of
the
real
existence
of
adonis
of
greece
tells
us
upon
the
authority
of
the
poet
panyasis
that
he
was
a
veritable
son
of
theias
king
of
syria
but
of
all
the
characters
who
figured
in
the
mythological
works
or
lawless
rhapsodies
of
the
ancients
and
worshiped
by
them
as
crucified
gods
and
saviors
none
has
perhaps
been
so
indubitably
so
positively
and
so
universally
set
down
as
mythological
or
fabulous
as
that
of
prometheus
of
caucasus
and
yet
lempriere
tells
us
in
his
classical
dictionary
that
he
was
the
son
of
japetus
sir
isaac
newton
says
he
was
a
descendant
of
the
famous
african
sesostris
while
that
erudite
and
masterly
historian
higgins
seems
to
have
entertained
no
doubt
of
his
personal
esse
nor
indeed
of
many
if
any
of
the
pagan
saviors
as
the
following
declaration
will
show
he
says
finding
men
in
india
and
other
countries
of
the
same
name
of
the
inferior
gods
as
it
is
quite
common
to
name
men
for
them
has
led
some
to
conclude
that
those
deified
men
never
existed
but
are
merely
mythological
names
of
the
sun
true
the
first
supreme
god
of
every
nation
not
excepting
the
jews
was
the
sun
but
more
modernly
the
names
were
transferred
to
men
again
he
says
inasmuch
as
some
of
them
are
found
to
have
been
real
bona
fide
human
beings
there
is
nothing
unreasonable
in
concluding
that
all
were
and
if
we
take
into
consideration
the
true
and
indisputable
fact
that
the
priests
had
everything
at
their
disposal
and
the
strongest
motives
for
concealing
and
suppressing
not
to
say
garbling
and
destroying
evidence
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
the
histories
of
some
of
these
gods
should
be
somewhat
obscure
and
ambiguous
further
on
he
declares
in
every
case
the
savior
was
incarnate
and
in
nearly
every
case
the
place
in
which
he
was
actually
born
was
exhibited
to
the
people
and
upon
the
authority
of
the
hierophant
we
will
add
the
memories
of
many
of
them
have
been
consecrated
and
perpetuated
by
tombs
placed
beside
their
temples
which
is
perhaps
the
most
convincing
species
of
evidence
that
could
be
offered
the
evidence
then
is
precisely
of
the
same
character
as
that
offered
in
the
case
of
jesus
christ
to
prove
that
the
pagan
saviors
did
really
possess
a
substantial
earthly
and
bodily
existence
though
it
is
true
that
it
never
has
been
universally
conceded
or
believed
by
christian
themselves
that
jesus
christ
ever
had
a
personal
or
corporeal
existence
on
earth
cotilenius
in
a
note
on
ignatius
epistle
to
the
trallians
written
in
the
third
century
of
the
christian
era
declares
that
it
is
as
absurd
to
deny
the
doctrine
which
taught
that
jesus
christ
body
was
a
phantom
as
to
deny
that
the
sun
shone
at
midday
his
physical
body
of
course
was
meant
for
it
appears
he
believed
in
his
eternal
existence
as
a
spirit
in
heaven
and
we
find
whole
sects
advocating
similar
views
in
the
early
ages
of
the
christian
church
one
of
the
most
primitive
and
learned
sects
says
a
writer
were
the
manicheans
who
denied
that
jesus
christ
ever
existed
in
flesh
and
blood
but
believed
him
to
be
a
god
in
spirit
only
others
denied
him
to
be
a
god
but
believed
him
to
have
been
a
prophet
or
inspired
character
like
the
unitarians
of
the
present
day
some
denied
his
crucifixion
others
asserted
it
it
is
more
than
probable
that
this
was
the
cause
of
dispute
between
paul
and
barnabas
mentioned
in
the
acts
of
the
apostles
seeing
that
paul
had
laid
such
peculiar
emphasis
on
jesus
christ
and
him
crucified
and
this
conclusion
is
corroborated
by
its
being
expressly
stated
in
the
gospel
of
barnabas
that
jesus
christ
was
not
crucified
but
was
carried
to
heaven
by
four
angels
there
was
a
long
list
says
the
same
writer
from
the
earliest
times
of
sincere
christians
who
denied
that
jesus
christ
rose
from
the
dead
while
as
we
may
remark
here
there
could
not
have
been
at
that
early
date
any
grounds
for
denying
these
things
had
he
really
figured
in
the
world
in
the
miraculous
and
extraordinary
and
public
manner
as
that
related
in
the
gospels
chapter
xvi
sixteen
saviors
crucified
for
i
determined
not
to
know
anything
among
you
save
jesus
christ
and
him
crucified
i
cor
ii
there
must
have
existed
a
very
considerable
amount
of
skepticism
in
the
community
as
to
the
truth
of
the
report
of
the
crucifixion
of
jesus
christ
in
the
country
and
era
of
its
occurrence
to
make
it
necessary
thus
to
erect
it
into
an
important
dogma
and
make
it
imperative
to
believe
it
there
must
have
been
a
large
margin
for
distrusting
its
truth
the
determination
not
to
know
anything
but
the
crucifixion
of
jesus
christ
was
narrowing
down
his
knowledge
to
rather
a
small
compass
and
such
a
resolution
would
necessarily
preclude
him
from
acquainting
himself
with
the
history
of
any
other
cases
of
crucifixion
that
might
have
occurred
before
that
of
his
own
favorite
messiah
what
was
there
ever
a
case
of
crucifixion
beside
that
of
jesus
christ
a
good
christian
brother
or
sister
sometimes
exclaims
when
the
world
sixteen
crucified
saviors
are
spoken
of
we
meet
the
question
with
the
reply
you
seem
to
be
a
disciple
of
paul
whose
position
would
not
allow
him
to
know
of
any
other
cases
of
crucifixion
but
that
of
jesus
christ
hence
he
may
have
considered
it
meritorious
to
perpetuate
his
ignorance
on
the
subject
and
you
perhaps
are
ignorant
from
the
same
cause
it
is
the
nature
of
all
religions
based
on
fear
and
unchangeable
dogmas
to
deter
and
thus
exclude
its
disciples
from
all
knowledge
adverse
to
their
own
creeds
and
sometimes
their
own
religious
systems
are
magnified
to
such
an
exalted
appreciation
above
all
others
as
to
lead
them
to
destroy
the
evidence
of
the
existence
of
the
latter
for
fear
of
their
ultimate
rivalry
taylor
informs
us
that
some
of
the
early
disciples
of
the
christian
faith
demolished
accessible
monuments
representing
and
memorializing
the
crucifixion
of
the
ancient
oriental
gods
so
that
they
are
now
unknown
in
the
annals
of
christian
history
hence
the
surprise
excited
in
the
minds
of
christian
professors
when
other
cases
are
mentioned
such
influences
as
referred
to
above
have
shut
out
from
the
minds
of
the
disciples
of
several
religious
systems
a
knowledge
of
all
crucified
gods
but
their
own
hence
the
hindoo

in
knowing
only
chrishna

the
suspicion

gods

for

sins
of
man
long
anterior
to
the
advent
of
the
immaculate
nazarene
we
will
now
lay
before
the
reader
a
brief
account
of
the
crucifixion
of
more
than
a
dozen
gods
and
saviors
predicated
upon
facts
which
have
escaped
the
hands
of
the
christian
iconoclasts
determined
to
know
only
jesus
christ
crucified
we
will
first
notice
the
case
of
the
indian
god
chrishna
crucifixion
of
chrishna
of
india
among
the
gods
who
condescended
in
ancient
times
to
forsake
the
throne
of
heaven
and
descend
upon
the
plains
of
india
through
human
birth
to
suffer
and
die
for
the
sins
and
transgressions
of
the
human
race
the
eighth
avatar
or
savior
may
be
considered
the
most
important
and
the
most
exalted
character
as
he
led
the
most
conspicuous
life
and
commanded
the
most
devout
and
the
most
universal
homage
and
while
some
of
the
other
incarnate
demigods
were
invested
with
only
a
limited
measure
of
the
infinite
deityship
chrishna
according
to
the
teachings
of
their
new
testament
the
ramazand
comprehended
in
himself
a
full
measure
of
the
bodily
the
evidence
of
his
having
been
crucified
is
as
conclusive
as
any
other
sacrificial
or
god
whose
name
has
been
memorialized
in
history
or
embalmed
as
a
sacred
idol
in
the
memories
of
his
devout
worshipers

english
traveler
and
writer

from

and
monuments

he
has
arranged
together
in
a
work
entitled

on

of

made
by
the
act
of
crucifixion
higgins
who
examined
this
work
which
he
found
in
the
british
museum
makes
a
report
of
a
number
of
the
transcript
drawings
intended
to
represent
the
crucifixion
of
this
oriental
and
mediatorial
god
which
we
will
here
condense
in
plate
this
savior
is
represented
with
a
hole
in
the
top
of
one
foot
just
above
the
toes
where
the
nail
was
inserted
in
the
act
of
crucifixion
in
another
drawing
he
is
represented
exactly
in
the
form
of
a
romish
christian
crucifix
but
not
fixed
or
fastened
to
a
tree
though
the
legs
and
feet
are
arranged
in
the
usual
way
with
in
the
latter
there
is
a
halo
of
glory
over
it
emanating
from
the
heavens
above
just
as
we
have
seen
jesus
christ
represented
in
a
work
by
a
christian
writer
entitled
quarles
emblems
also
in
other
christian
books
in
several
of
the
icons
drawings
there
are
marks
of
holes
in
both
feet
and
in
others
of
holes
in
the
hands
only
in
the
first
drawing
which
he
consulted
the
marks
are
very
faint
so
as
to
be
scarcely
visible
in
figures
four
and
five
of
plate
eleven
the
figures
have
in
both
feet
while
the
hands
are
not

figure
six
has
on
it
the
representation
of
a
round
hole
in
the
side
to
his
collar
or
shirt
hangs
an
emblem
of
a
heart
represented
in
the
same
manner
as
those
attached
to
the
imaginary
likenesses
of
jesus
christ
which
may
now
be
found
in
some
christian
countries
figure
has
a
hole
in
one
foot
and
a
nail
through
the
other
and
a
round
nail
or
pin
mark
in
one
hand
only
while
the
other
is
ornamented
with
a
dove
and
a
serpent
both
emblems
of
deity
in
the
christian
bible
now
we
raise
the
query
here
and
drive
it
into
the
innermost
temple
of
the
christian
conscience
with
the
overwhelming
force
of
the
unconquerable
logic
of
history
does
all
this
mean
and
if
they
will
only
let
conviction
have
its
perfect
work
while
answering
this
question
unhampered
by
the
inherited
prejudices
of
a
thousand
years
they
can
henceforth
rejoice
in
the
discovery
of
a
glorious
historical
truth
calculated
to
disenthrall
their
minds
from
the
superstitions
of
crosses
crucifixions
and
bloody
atonements
on
which
they
have
been
accustomed
to
hang
the
salvation
of
the
world
if
the
credibility
of
the
relation
of
these
incidents
going
to
prove
an
astonishing
coincidence
in
the
sacred
histories
of
the
hindoo
and
christian
saviors
and
demonstrating
the
doctrine
of
the
crucifixion
as
having
been
practically
realized
and
preached
to
the
world
long
anterior
to
the
offering
of
a
god
once
for
all
on
mount
calvary
if
its
credibility
rested
on
mere
testimony
mere
pagan
tradition
or
even
upon
the
best
digested
and
most
authentic
annals
of
the
past
that
have
escaped
the
ravages
of
time
there
might
still
be
a
forlorn
hope
for
the
stickler
for
the
christian
faith
now
struggling
in
the
agonies
of
a
credal
skepticism
that
the
whole
thing
has
been
plagiarized
from
the
christian
gospels
for
paper
and
parchment
history
can
be
and
has
been
mutilated
but
the
verity
of
this
account
rests
upon
no
such
a
precarious
basis
its
antiquity
reaching
far
beyond
the
christian
era
is
corroborated
and
demonstrated
by
imperishable
monuments
indentures
burrowed
into
the
granite
rock
which
bid
defiance
to
the
fingers
of
time
and
even
the
hands
of
the
frenzied
iconoclast
to
destroy
or
deface
though
impelled
and
spurred
on
to
the
effort
by
the
conviction
burning
in
his
soul
that
the
salvation
of
the
human
race
depends
upon
believing
that
there
is
no
other
name
given
under
heaven
whereby
men
can
be
saved
than
his
own
crucified
god
and
that
all
others
are
but
thieves
robbers
and
antichrists
some
of
the
disciples
of
the
oriental
systems
cherished
this
conviction
and
christians
and
mahommedans
seem
to
have
inherited
it
in
magnified
proportions
hence
we
are
credibly
informed
that
some
of
the
earlier
christian
saints
having
determined
like
paul
to
know
only
jesus
christ
and
him
crucified
made
repeated
efforts
to
obliterate
these
sacred
facts
so
fatally
damaging
to
their
creeds
from
the
page
of
history
higgins
suggests
that
if
we
could
have
persons
less
under
the
influence
of
sectarian
prejudice
to
visit
examine
and
report
on
the
sculptures
and
monuments
of
india
covered
over
as
they
are
with
antiquated
and
significant
figures
appertaining
to
and
illustrating
their
religious
history
we
might
accumulate
still
more
light
bearing
upon
the
history
of
the
crucifixion
of
the
savior
and
chrishna
most
of
our
reports
he
declares
are
fragmentary
if
not
having
come
through
the
hands
of
christian
missionaries
bishops
and
priests
he
informs
us
that
a
report
on
the
hindoo
religion
made
out
by
a
deputation
from
the
british
parliament
sent
to
india
for
the
purpose
of
examining
their
sacred
books
and
monuments
being
left
in
the
hands
of
a
christian
bishop
at
calcutta
and
with
instructions
to
forward
it
to
england
was
found
on
its
arrival
in
london
to
be
so
horribly
mutilated
and
eviscerated
as
to
be
scarcely
cognizable
the
account
of
the
crucifixion
was
gone
out
the
inference
is
patent
and
we
have
it
upon
the
authority
of
this
same
reliable
and
truthful
writer
sir
godfrey
higgins
that
the
author
of
the
hindoo
pantheon
moor
after
having
announced
his
intention
to
publish
it
to
the
world
was
visited
and
labored
with
by
some
of
his
devout
christian
neighbors
zealous
for
the
faith
once
delivered
to
the
saints
who
endeavored
to
dissuade
him
from
publishing
such
facts
to
the
world
as
he
represented
his
book
to
contain
for
fear
it
would
have
the
effect
to
unsettle
the
faith
of
some
of
the
weak
brethren
some
of
the
church
members
in
the
religion
of
jesus
christ
by
raising
doubts
in
their
minds
as
to
the
originality
of
the
gospel
story
of
the
crucifixion
of
christ
or
at
least
of
his
having
been
crucified
as
a
god
for
a
his
crucifixion
is
a
possible
event
it
may
be
thus
far
a
true
narrative
but
the
adjunct
of
the
atonement
with
its
efficacy
to
obliterate
the
effects
of
sin
connected
with
the
idea
that
an
infinite
omnipotent
and
god
was
put
to
death
when
a
human
form
was
slain
upon
the
cross
never
no
never
it
is
a
thought
too
monstrous
to
find
lodgment
in
an
enlightened
human
mind
another
case
evincing
the
same
spirit
as
that
narrated
above
is
found
in
the
circumstance
of
a
christian
missionary
a
maurice
publishing
a
historical
account
of
this
or
demigod
of
the
hindoos
and
omitting
any
allusion
to
his
crucifixion
this
was
entirely
left
out
apparently
from
design
his
death
resurrection
and
ascension
were
spoken
of
but
the
crucifixion
skipped
over
he
could
not
have
been
ignorant
of
this
chapter
in
his
history
as
the
writers
preceding
him
from
whom
he
copied
had
related
it
among
this
number
may
be
mentioned
the
learned
french
writer
monsieur
guigniant
who
in
his
religion
of
the
ancients
speaks
so
specifically
of
the
crucifixion
of
this
god
as
to
name
the
circumstance
of
his
being
nailed
to
a
tree
he
also
states
that
before
his
exit
he
made
some
remarkable
prophecies
appertaining
to
the
crimes
and
miseries
of
the
world
in
the
approaching
future
reminding
us
of
the
wars
and
rumors
of
wars
predicted
by
the
christian
messiah
higgins
names
the
same
circumstance
we
have
it
upon
the
authority
of
more
than
one
writer
on
hindoo
or
indian
antiquities
that
there
is
a
rock
temple
at
mathura
in
the
form
of
a
cross
and
facing
the
four
cardinal
points
of
the
compass
which
is
admitted
by
all
beholders
as
presenting
the
proof
in
bold
relief
of
extreme
age
and
inside
of
this
temple
stands
a
statue
of
the
savior
of
men
chrishna
of
india
presenting
the
proof
of
being
coeval
in
construction
with
the
temple
itself
by
the
circumstance
of
its
being
cut
out
of
the
same
rock
and
constituting
a
part
of
the
temple
further
citations
of
this
character
will
be
found
under
the
head
of
parallels
chapter
xxxii
thus
we
have
the
proof
deeply
and
indelibly
carved
in
the
old
rocks
of
india
that
their
lord
and
savior
chrishna
atoned
for
the
sins
of
a
world
by
pouring
out
his
blood
as
a
propitiatory
offering
while
stretched
upon
the
cross
no
wonder
in
view
of
such
historic
bulwarks
wiseman
for
ten
years
a
christian
missionary
should
have
exclaimed
can
we
be
surprised
that
the
enemies
of
our
holy
religion
should
seize
upon
this
legend
the
crucifixion
of
chrishna
as
containing
the
original
of
our
gospel
history
christian
reader
please
ponder
over
the
facts
of
this
chapter
and
let
conviction
have
its
perfect
work
life
character
religion
and
miracles
of
chrishna
the
history
of
chrishna
zeus
or
jeseus
as
some
writers
spell
it
is
contained
principally
in
the
baghavat
gita
the
episode
portion
of
the
mahabaret
bible
the
book
is
believed
to
be
divinely
inspired
like
all
other
bibles
and
the
hindoos
claim
for
it
an
antiquity
of
six
thousand
years
like
christ
he
was
of
humble
origin
and
like
him
had
to
encounter
opposition
and
persecution
but
he
seems
to
have
been
more
successful
in
the
propagation
of
his
doctrines
for
it
is
declared
he
soon
became
surrounded
by
many
earnest
followers
and
the
people
in
vast
multitudes
followed
him
crying
aloud
is
indeed
the
redeemer
promised
to
our
fathers
his
pathway
was
thickly
strewn
with
miracles
which
consisted
in
healing
the
sick
curing
lepers
restoring
the
dumb
deaf
and
the
blind
raising
the
dead
aiding
the
weak
comforting
the
relieving
the
oppressed
casting
out
devils
etc
he
come
not
ostensibly
to
destroy
the
previous
relgion
but
to
purify
it
of
its
impurities
and
to
preach
a
better
doctrine
he
came
as
he
declared
to
reject
evil
and
restore
the
reign
of
good
and
redeem
man
from
the
consequences
of
the
fall
and
deliver
the
oppressed
earth
from
its
load
of
sin
and
suffering
his
disciples
believed
him
to
be
god
himself
and
millions
worshiped
him
as
such
in
the
time
of
alexander
the
great
the
hundreds
of
counterparts
to
the
history
of
christ
proving
their
histories
to
be
almost
identical
will
be
found
enumerated
in
chapter
such
as
his
miraculous
birth
by
a
virgin
the
mother
and
child
being
visited
by
shepherds
wise
men
and
the
angelic
host
who
joyously
sang
in
thy
delivery
o
favored
among
women
all
nations
shall
have
cause
to
exult
the
edict
of
the
tyrant
ruler
cansa
ordering
all
the
first
born
to
be
put
to
death
the
miraculous
escape
of
the
mother
and
child
from
his
bloody
decree
by
the
parting
of
the
waves
of
the
river
jumna
to
permit
them
to
pass
through
on
dry
ground
the
early
retirement
of
chrishna
to
a
desert
his
baptism
or
ablution
in
the
river
ganges
corresponding
to
christ
baptism
in
jordan
his
transfiguration
at
madura
where
he
assured
his
disciples
that
present
or
absent
i
will
always
be
with
you
he
had
a
favorite
disciple
arjoon
who
was
his
bosom
friend
as
john
was
christ
he
was
anointed
with
oil
by
women
like
christ
a
somewhat
similar
fish
story
is
told
of
him
his
disciples
being
enabled
by
him
to
catch
large
draughts
of
the
finny
prey
in
their
nets
for
three
hundred
other
similar
parallels
see
chapter
xxxii
like
christ
he
taught
much
by
parables
and
precepts
a
notable
sermon
preached
by
him
is
also
reported
which
we
have
not
space
for
here
on
one
occasion
having
returned
from
a
ministerial
journey
as
he
entered
madura
the
people
came
out
in
crowds
to
meet
him
strewing
the
ground
with
the
branches
of
trees
and
desiring
to
hear
him
he
addressed
them
in
parables
the
conclusion
and
moral
of
one
of
which
called
the
parable
of
the
fishes
runs
thus
and
thus
it
is
o
people
of
madura
that
you
ought
to
protect
the
weak
and
each
other
and
not
retaliate
upon
an
enemy
the
wrongs
he
may
have
done
you
here
we
see
the
peace
doctrine
preached
in
its
purity
and
thus
it
was
says
a
writer
that
chrishna
spread
among
the
people
the
holy
doctrines
of
purest
morality
and
initiated
his
hearers
into
the
exalted
principles
of
charity
of
and
at
a
time
when
the
desert
countries
of
the
west
were
inhabited
only
by
savage
tribes
and
we
will
add
long
before
christianity
was
thought
of
purity
of
life
and
spiritual
insight
we
are
told
were
distinguishing
traits
in
the
character
of
this
oriental
savior
and
that
he
was
often
moved
with
compassion
for
the
downtrodden
and
the
suffering
a
budhist
in
ceylon
who
sent
his
son
to
a
christian
school
once
remarked
to
a
missionary
i
respect
christianity
as
a
help
to
budhism
thus
is
disclosed
the
fact
that
the
motives
of
some
of
the
heathen
in
sending
to
christian
schools
is
the
promotion
of
their
own
religion
which
they
consider
superior
and
in
many
respects
most
of
them
are
for
proof
see
chapter
on
bibles
we
have
the
remarkable
admission
of
the
that
the
best
precepts
of
the
christian
bible
are
contained
in
the
hindoo
baghavat
then
it
is
not
true
that
christ
spake
as
man
never
spake
and
if
his
best
precepts
were
previously
recorded
in
an
old
heathen
bible
then
they
afford
no
proof
of
his
divinity
this
suicidal
concession
of
the
pulls
up
the
claims
of
orthodox
christianity
by
the
roots
and
many
of
the
precepts
uttered
by
chrishna
display
a
profound
wisdom
and
depth
of
thought
equal
to
any
of
those
attributed
to
jesus
christ
in
proof
of
the
statement
we
will
cite
a
few
examples
out
of
the
hundreds
in
our
possession
those
who
do
not
control
their
passions
can
not
act
properly
toward
others
the
evils
we
inflict
upon
others
follow
us
as
our
shadows
follow
our
bodies
only
the
humble
are
beloved
of
god
virtue
sustains
the
soul
as
the
muscles
sustain
the
body
when
the
poor
man
knocks
at
your
door
take
him
and
administer
to
his
wants
for
the
poor
are
the
chosen
of
god
christ
said
god
hath
chosen
the
poor
let
your
hand
be
always
open
to
the
unfortunate
look
not
upon
a
woman
with
unchaste
desires
avoid
envy
covetousness
falsehood
imposture
and
slander
and
sexual
desires
above
all
things
cultivate
love
for
your
neighbor
when
you
die
you
leave
your
worldly
wealth
behind
you
but
your
virtues
and
vices
follow
you
contemn
riches
and
worldly
honor
seek
the
company
of
the
wicked
in
order
to
reform
them
do
good
for
its
own
sake
and
expect
not
your
reward
for
it
on
earth
the
soul
is
immortal
but
must
be
pure
and
free
from
all
sin
and
stain
before
it
can
return
to
him
who
gave
it
the
soul
is
inclined
to
good
when
it
follows
the
inward
light
the
soul
is
responsible
to
god
for
its
actions
who
has
established
rewards
and
punishments
cultivate
that
inward
knowledge
which
teaches
what
is
right
and
wrong
never
take
delight
in
another
misfortunes
it
is
better
to
forgive
an
injury
than
to
avenge
it
you
can
accomplish
by
kindness
what
you
can
not
by
force
a
noble
spirit
finds
a
cure
for
injustice
by
forgetting
it
pardon
the
offense
of
others
but
not
your
own
what
you
blame
in
others
do
not
practice
yourself
by
forgiving
an
enemy
you
make
many
friends
do
right
from
hatred
of
evil
and
not
from
fear
of
punishment
a
wise
man
corrects
his
own
errors
by
observing
those
of
others
he
who
rules
his
temper
conquers
his
greatest
enemy
the
wise
man
governs
his
passions
but
the
fool
obeys
them
be
at
war
with
men
vices
but
at
peace
with
their
persons
there
should
be
no
disagreement
between
your
lives
and
your
doctrine
spend
every
day
as
though
it
were
the
last
lead
not
one
life
in
public
and
another
in
private
anger
in
trying
to
torture
others
punishes
itself
a
disgraceful
death
is
honorable
when
you
die
in
a
good
cause
by
growing
familiar
with
vices
we
learn
to
tolerate
them
easily
we
must
master
our
evil
propensities
or
they
will
master
us
he
who
has
conquered
his
propensities
rules
over
a
kingdom
protect
love
and

if
you
would
serve

from

from
the
will
action
true
or
false
just
or
unjust
as
the
sandal
tree
perfumes
the
axe

fells
it
so
the
good
man
sheds
fragrance
on
his
enemies
spend
a
portion
of
each
day
in
pious
devotion
to
love
the
virtues
of
others
is
to
brighten
your
own
he
who
gives
to
the
needy
loses
nothing
himself
a
good
wise
and
benevolent
man
can
not
be
rich
much
riches
is
a
curse
to
the
possessor
the
wounds
of
the
soul
are
more
important
than
those
of
the
body
the
virtuous
man
is
like
the
banyan
tree
which
shelters
and
protects
all
around
it
money
does
not
satisfy
the
love
of
gain
but
only
stimulates
it
your
greatest
enemy
is
in
your
own
bosom
to
flee
when
charged
is
to
confess
your
guilt
the
wounds
of
conscience
leave
a
scar
compare
these
precepts
of
chrishna
with
the
precepts
of
christ
and
you
must
confess
they
suffer
nothing
by
the
comparison
if
we
had
space
we
would
like
to
quote
also
from
the
vedas
we
will
merely
cite
a
few
examples
relative
to
woman
he
who
is
cursed
by
woman
is
cursed
by
god
god
will
punish
him
who
laughs
at
woman
sufferings
when
woman
is
honored
god
is
honored
the
virtuous
woman
will
have
but
one
husband
and
the
man
but
one
wife
it
is
the
highest
crime
to
take
advantage
of
the
weakness
of
woman
woman
should
be
loved
respected
and
protected
by
husbands
fathers
and
brothers
etc
for
more
see
chapter
on
bibles
before
we
close
this
chapter
we
must
anticipate
and
answer
an
objection
it
will
be
said
that
the
reported
amours
of
chrishna
and
his
reencounter
with
cansa
constitute
a
criticism
on
his
character
if
so
we
will
point
to
christ
fight
or
angry
combat
with
the
in
the
temple
as
an
offset
to
it
and
then
it
should
be
remembered
that
disciples
claim
that
these
stories
are
mere
fable
or
allegorical
and
are
not
found
in
the
most
approved
or
canonical
writings
crucifixion
of
the
hindoo
sakia
how
many
gods
who
figured
in
hindoo
history
suffered
death
upon
the
cross
as
atoning
offerings
for
the
sins
of
mankind
is
a
point
not
clearly
established
by
their
sacred
books
but
the
death
of
the
god
above
named
known
as
sakia
budha
sakia
or
sakia
muni
is
distinctly
referred
to
by
several
writers
both
oriental
and
christian
though
there
appears
to
be
in
budhist
countries
different
accounts
of
the
death
of
the
famous
and
extensively
worshiped
saviors
in
some
countries
the
story
runs
a
god
was
crucified
by
an
arrow
being
driven
through
his
body
which
fastened
him
to
a
tree
the
tree
with
the
arrow
thus
projecting
at
right
angles
formed
the
cross
emblematical
of
the
atoning
sacrifice
sakia
an
account
states
was
crucified
by
his
enemies
for
the
humble
act
of
plucking
a
flower
in
a
garden
doubtless
seized
on
as
a
mere
pretext
rather
than
as
being
considered
a
crime
one
of
the
accusations
brought
against
christ
it
will
be
remembered
was
that
of
plucking
the
ripened
ears
of
corn
on
the
sabbath
and
it
is
a
remarkable
circumstance
that
in
the
pictures
of
christian
countries
representing
the
virgin
mary
with
the
infant
jesus
in
her
arms
either
the
child
or
the
mother
is
frequently
represented
with
a
bunch
of
flowers
in
the
hand
here
let
it
be
noted
the
association
of
flowers
with
divinely
born
saviors
in
india
is
indicated
in
the
religious
books
of
that
country
to
have
originated
from
the
conception
of
the
virgin
parting
with
the
flowers
of
her
virginity
by
giving
birth
to
a
divine
child
whereby
she
lost
the
immortality
of
her
physical
nature
it
being
transferred
by
that
act
to
her
son
and
from
this
circumstance
sakia
is
represented
as
having
been
crucified
for
abstracting
a
flower
from
a
garden
that
his
crucifixion
was
designed
as
a
offering
is
evident
from
the
following
declaration
found
in
his
sacred
biography
viz
he
in
mercy
left
paradise
and
came
down
to
earth
because
he
was
filled
with
compassion
for
the
sins
and
miseries
of
mankind
he
sought
to
lead
them
into
better
paths
and
took
their
sufferings
upon
himself
that
he
might
expiate
their
crimes
and
mitigate
the
punishment
they
must
otherwise
inevitably
undergo
prog
rel
ideas
vol
p
he
believed
and
taught
his
followers
that
all
sin
is
inevitably
punished
either
in
this
or
the
future
life
and
so
great
were
his
sympathy
and
tenderness
that
he
condescended
to
suffer
that
punishment
himself
by
an
ignominious
death
upon
the
cross
after
which
he
descended
into
hades
hell
to
suffer
for
a
time
three
days
for
the
inmates
of
that
dreadful
and
horrible
prison
that
he
might
show
he
sympathized
with
them
after
his
resurrection
and
before
his
ascension
to
heaven
as
well
as
during
his
earthly
sojourn
he
imparted
to
the
world
some
beautiful
lofty
and
precepts
the
object
of
his
mission
says
a
writer
was
to
instruct
those
who
were
straying
from
the
right
path
and
expiate
the
sins
of
mortals
by
his
own
suffering
and
procure
for
them
a
happy
entrance
into
paradise
by
obedience
to
his
precepts
and
prayers
to
his
name
ibid
his
followers
always
speak
of
him
as
one
with
god
from
all
eternity
ibid
his
most
common
title
was
the
savior
of
the
world
he
was
also
called
the
benevolent
one
the
dispenser
of
grace
the
source
of
life
the
light
of
the
world
the
true
light
etc
his
mother
was
a
very
pure
refined
pious
and
devout
woman
never
indulged
in
any
impure
thoughts
words
or
actions
she
was
so
much
esteemed
for
her
virtues
and
for
being
the
mother
of
a
god
that
an
escort
of
ladies
attended
her
wherever
she
went
the
trees
bowed
before
her
as
she
passed
through
the
forest
and
flowers
sprang
up
wherever
her
foot
pressed
the
ground
she
was
saluted
as
the
holy
virgin
queen
of
heaven
it
is
said
that
when
her
divine
child
was
born
he
stood
upright
and
proclaimed
i
will
put
an
end
to
the
sufferings
and
sorrows
of
the
world
and
immediately
a
light
shone
around
about
the
young
messiah
he
spent
much
time
in
retirement
and
like
christ
in
another
respect
was
once
tempted
by
a
demon
who
offered
him
all
the
honors
and
wealth
of
the
world
but
he
rebuked
the
devil
saying
be
gone
hinder
me
not
he
began
like
christ
to
preach
his
gospel
and
heal
the
sick
when
about
years
of
age
and
it
is
declared
the
blind
saw
the
deaf
heard
the
dumb
spoke
the
lame
danced
and
the
crooked
became
straight
hence
the
people
declared
he
is
no
mortal
child
but
an
incarnation
of
the
deity
his
religion
was
of
a
very
superior
character
he
proclaimed
my
law
is
a
law
of
grace
for
all
his
religion
knew
no
race
no
sex
no
caste
and
no
aristocratic
priesthood
it
taught
says
max
muller
the
equality
of
all
men
and
the
brotherhood
of
the
human
race
all
men
without
regard
to
rank
birth
or
nation
says
dunckar
form
according
to
budha
view
one
great
suffering
association
in
this
earthly
vale
of
tears
therefore
the
commandments
of
love
forbearance
patience
compassion
pity
brotherliness
of
all
men
klaproth
a
german
professor
of
oriental
languages
says
this
religion
is
calculated
to
ennoble
the
human
race
it
is
difficult
to
comprehend
says
a
french
writer
leboulay
how
men
not
assisted
by
revelation
could
have
soared
so
high
and
approached
so
near
the
truth
dunckar
says
this
oriental
god
taught
chastity
temperance
the
control
of
the
passions
to
bear
injustice
from
others
to
suffer
death
quietly
and
without
hate
of
your
persecutor
to
grieve
not
for
one
own
misfortunes
but
for
those
of
others
an
investigation
of
their
history
will
show
that
that
they
lived
up
to
these
moral
injunctions
besides
the
five
great
commandments
says
a
wesleyan
missionary
spense
hardy
in
his
dahmma
padam
every
shade
of
vice
hypocrisy
anger
pride
suspicion
greediness
gossiping
and
cruelty
to
animals
is
guarded
against
by
special
precepts
among
the
virtues
recommended
we
find
not
only
reverence
for
parents
care
for
children
submission
to
authority
gratitude
moderation
in
all
things
submission
in
time
of
trial
equanimity
at
all
times
but
virtues
unknown
in
some
systems
of
morality
such
as
the
duty
of
forgiving
injuries
and
not
rewarding
evil
for
evil
and
we
will
add
both
charity
and
love
are
specially
recommended
we
have
it
also
upon
the
authority
of
dunckar
that
budha
proclaimed
that
salvation
and
redemption
have
come
for
all
even
the
lowest
and
most
abject
classes
for
he
broke
down
the
iron
caste
of
the
brahminical
code
which
had
so
long
ruled
india
and
aimed
to
place
all
mankind
upon
a
level
his
followers
have
been
stigmatize
by
christian
professors
as
idolaters
but
sir
john
bowling
in
his
kingdom
and
people
of
siam
denies
that
they
are
idolaters
because
says
he
no
budhist
believes
his
image
to
be
god
or
anything
more
than
an
outward
representation
of
deity
their
deific
images
are
looked
upon
with
the
same
views
and
feelings
as
a
christian
venerates
the
photograph
of
his
deceased
friend
hence
if
one
is
an
idolater
the
other
is
also
with
respect
to
the
charge
of
polytheism
missionary
hue
says
that
although
their
religion
embraces
many
inferior
deities
who
fill
the
same
offices
that
angels
do
under
the
christian
system
yet
adds
hue
monotheism
is
the
real
character
of
buddhism
and
confirms
the
statement
by
the
testimony
of
a
thibetan
it
should
be
noted
here
that
although
budhism
succeeded
in
converting
about
three
hundred
millions
or
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
globe
it
was
never
propagated
by
the
sword
and
never
persecuted
the
disciples
of
other
religions
its
conquests
were
made
by
a
rational
appeal
to
the
human
mind
hodgson
says
it
recognizes
the
infinite
capacity
of
the
human
intellect
and
hilaire
declares
love
for
all
beings
is
its
nucleus
and
to
love
our
enemies
and
not
prosecute
are
the
virtues
of
this
people
max
muller
says
its
moral
code
taken
by
itself
is
one
of
the
most
perfect
the
world
has
ever
known
its
five
commandments
are
thou
shalt
not
kill
thou
shalt
not
steal
thou
shalt
not
commit
adultery
or
any
impurity
thou
shall
not
lie
thou
shalt
not
intoxicate
thyself
to
establish
the
above
cited
doctrines
and
precepts
budha
sent
forth
his
disciples
into
the
world
to
preach
his
gospel
to
every
creature
and
if
any
convert
had
committed
a
sin
in
word
thought
or
deed
he
was
to
confess
and
repent
one
of
the
tracts
which
they
distributed
declares
there
is
undoubtedly
a
life
after
this
in
which
the
virtuous
may
expect
the
reward
of
their
good
deeds
judgment
takes
place
immediately
after
death
budha
and
his
followers
set
an
example
to
the
world
of
enduring
opposition
and
persecution
with
great
patience
and
and
some
of
them
suffered
martyrdom
rather
than
abandon
their
principles
and
gloried
in
thus
sealing
their
doctrines
with
their
lives
a
story
is
told
of
a
rich
merchant
by
the
name
of
purna
forsaking
all
to
follow
his
lord
and
master
and
also
of
his
encountering
and
talking
with
a
woman
of
low
caste
at
a
well
which
reminds
us
of
similar
incidents
in
the
history
of
christ
but
his
enemies
becoming
jealous
and
fearful
of
his
growing
power
finally
crucified
him
near
the
foot
of
the
nepaul
mountains
about
but
after
his
death
burial
and
resurrection
we
are
told
he
ascended
back
to
heaven
where
millions
of
his
followers
believed
he
had
existed
with
brahma
from
all
eternity
in
the
cases
of
crucifixion
which
follow
nothing
like
accuracy
can
be
expected
with
respect
to
the
dates
of
their
occurrence
as
all
history
covering
the
period
beyond
the
modern
era
or
prior
to
the
time
of
alexander
the
great
is
involved
in
a
labyrinth
of
uncertainty
with
respect
to
dates
hence
bible
chronologists
differ
to
the
extent
of
three
thousand
years
with
respect
to
the
time
of
every
event
recorded
in
the
old
testament
compare
the
hebrew
and
septuagint
versions
of
the
bible
the
former
makes
the
world
three
thousand
nine
hundred
and
forty
four
and
the
latter
five
thousand
two
hundred
and
seventy
years
old
at
the
birth
of
christ
a
difference
of
thirteen
hundred
and
years
and
other
translations
differ
still
more
widely
all
the
cases
of
crucifixion
which
follow
occurred
before
the
time
of
christ
but
the
exact
time
of
many
of
them
can
not
be
fixed
with
certainty
thammuz
of
syria
crucified
the
history
of
this
god
is
furnished
us
in
fragments
by
several
writers
portions
of
which
will
be
found
in
other
chapters
of
this
work
the
fullest
history
extant
of
this
is
probably
that
of
ctesias
author
of

the

has
perpetuated
his
memory
in

us
anac
vol
that
this
god
was
crucified
at
the
period
above
named
as
a
offering
the

just
quoted
is
predicated
upon
the
following

text
translated
by

trust

has
come
unto

julius
firmicus
speaks
of
this
god
rising
from
the
dead
for
the
salvation
of
the
world
the
christian
writer
parkhurst
alludes
to
this
savior
as
preceding
the
advent
of
christ
and
as
filling
to
some
extent
the
same
chapter
in
sacred
history
crucifixion
of
wittoba
of
the
telingoness
we
have
a
very
conclusive
historical
proof
of
the
crucifixion
of
this
heathen
god
higgins
tells
us
he
is
represented
in
his
history
with
in
his
hands
and
the
soles
of
his
feet
nails
hammers
and
pincers
are
constantly
seen
represented
on
his
crucifixes
and
are
objects
of
adoration
among
his
followers
and
the
iron
crown
of
lombardy
has
within
it
a
nail
of
what
is
claimed
as
his
true
original
cross
and
is
much
admired
and
venerated
on
that
account
the
worship
of
this
crucified
god
according
to
our
author
prevails
chiefly
in
the
travancore
and
other
southern
countries
in
the
region
of
madura
iao
of
nepaul
crucified
with
respect
to
the
crucifixion
of
this
ancient
savior
we
have
this
very
definite
and
specific
testimony
that
he
was
crucified
on
a
tree
in
nepaul
see
georgius
p
the
name
of
this
incarnate
god
and
oriental
savior
occurs
frequently
in
the
holy
bibles
and
sacred
books
of
other
countries
some
suppose
that
lao
often
spelt
jao
is
the
root
of
the
name
of
the
jewish
god
jehovah
hesus
of
the
celtic
druids
crucified
higgins
informs
us
that
the
celtic
druids
represent
their
god
hesus
as
having
been
crucified
with
a
lamb
on
one
side
and
an
elephant
on
the
other
and
that
this
occurred
long
before
the
christian
era
also
that
a
representation
of
it
may
now
be
seen
upon
the
of
brechin
in
this
symbolical
representation
of
the
crucifixion
the
elephant
being
the
largest
animal
known
was
chosen
to
represent
the
magnitude
of
the
sins
of
the
world
while
the
lamb
from
its
proverbial
innocent
nature
was
chosen
to
represent
the
innocency
of
the
victim
the
god
offered
as
a
propitiatory
sacrifice
and
thus
we
have
the
lamb
of
god
taking
away
the
sins
of
the
world
symbolical
language
used
with
respect
to
the
offering
of
jesus
christ
and
here
is
indicated
very
clearly
the
origin
of
the
figure
it
is
evidently
borrowed
from
the
druids
we
have
the
statement
of
the
above
writer
that
this
legend
was
found
amongst
the
canutes
of
gaul
long
before
jesus
christ
was
known
to

to
his
execution

as
a
propitiatory

for
the
sins
of
mankind
is
explicit
unequivocal
and
ineffaceable
the
evidence
is

indelibly
engraven

one

was
according
to
another

he
is
sometimes
represented
as
having

sometimes
two

as
having

with
him
that
the
advent
of

mexican
god
was
long
anterior
to

is
admitted
by
christian

as
we
have
shown
elsewhere
in

be
found
the
account
not
only
of
his
crucifixion
but
of
his
death
burial

into

many
other
incidences
are
found
related
of
him
in

sacred
biography
in
which
we
find
the
most
striking
counterparts
to
the
more
modern
gospel
story
of
jesus
christ
such
as
his
forty
days
temptation
and
fasting
his
riding
on

his
purification
in

his

things
and

the
crucifixion
of
this
roman
savior
is
briefly
noticed
by
higgins
and
is
remarkable
for
presenting
like
other
crucified
gods
several
parallel
features
to
that
of
the
judean
savior
not
only
in
the
circumstances
related
as
attending
his
crucifixion
but
also
in
a
considerable
portion
of
his
antecedent
life
he
is
represented
like

as
having
been
conceived
and
brought
forth
by
a

the
antiquity
of
the
story
is
beyond
dispute
marvelous
stories
are
told
of
the
birth
of
the
divine
redeemer
his
mother
was
a
virgin
of
black
complexion
and
hence
his
complexion
was
of
the
ebony
hue
as
in
the
case
of

and
some
other
saviors
he
descended
from
heaven
on
a
mission
of
benevolence
and
ascended
back
to
the
heavenly
mansion
after
his
crucifixion
he
led
a
life
of
strict
celibacy
which
he
taught
was
essential
to
true
holiness
he
inculcated
great
tenderness
toward
all
living
beings
he
could
walk
upon
the
water
or
upon
the
air
he
could
foretell
future
events
with
great
accuracy
he
practiced
the
most
devout
contemplation
severe
discipline
of
the
body
and
mind
and
acquired
the
most
complete
subjection
of
his
passions
he
was
worshiped
as
a
god
who
had
existed
as
a
spirit
from
all
eternity

were
called

alcestos
of
euripides
crucified
the
english
classical
journal
vol
xxxvii
furnishes
us
with
the
story
of
another
crucified
god
known
as
alcestos
a
female
god
or
goddess
and
in
this
respect
it
is
a
novelty
in
sacred
history
being
the
first
if
not
the
only
example
of
a
feminine
god
atoning
for
the
sins
of
the
world
upon
the
cross
the
doctrine
of
the

and
atoning
offering
for
sin
was
inculcated
as
a
part
of
her
religion
atys
of
phrygia
crucified
speaking
of
this
crucified
messiah
the
anacalypsis
informs
us
that
several
histories
are
given
of
him
but
all
concur
in
representing
him
as
having
been
an
atoning
offering
for
sin
and
the
latin
phrase
suspensus
lingo
found
in
his
history
indicates
the
manner
of
his
death
he
was
suspended
on
a
tree
crucified
buried
and
rose
again

the
chaldeans
as
higgins
informs

have
noted
in
their
sacred
books
the
account
of
the
crucifixion
of
a
god
with
the
above
name
he
was
also
known
as
the

and
was
styled
the

bali
of
orissa
crucified
we
learn
by
the
oriental
books
that
in
the
district
of
country
known
as
orissa
in
asia
they
have
the
story
of
a
crucified
god
known
by
several
names
including
the
above
all
of
which
we
are
told
signify
lord
second
having
reference
to
him
as
the
second
person
or
second
member
of
the
trinity
as
most
of
the
crucified
gods
occupied
that
position
in
the
trial
of
deities
constituting
the
trinity
as
indicated
by
the
language
father
son
and
holy
ghost
the
son
in
all
cases
being
the
atoning
offering
the
crucified
redeemer
and
the
second
person
of
the
trinity
this
god
bali
was
also
called
baliu
and
sometimes
bel
the
anacalypsis
informs
us
vol
i
that
monuments
of
this
crucified
god
bearing
great
age
may
be
found
amid
the
ruins
of
the
magnificent
city
of
mahabalipore
partially
buried
amongst
the
figures
of
the
temple
mithra
of
persia
crucified
this
persian
god
according
to
higgins
was
slain
upon
the
cross
to
make
atonement
for
mankind
and
to
take
away
the
sins
of
the
world
he
was
reputedly
born
on
the
day
of
december
and
crucified
on
a
tree
it
is
a
remarkable
circumstance
that
two
christian
writers
faber
and
bryant
both
speak
of
his
being
slain
and
yet
both
omit
to
speak
of
the
manner
in
which
he
was
put
to
death
and
the
same
policy
has
been
pursued
with
respect
to
other
crucified
gods
of
the
pagans
as
we
have
shown
elsewhere
our
list
is
full
or
we
might
note
other
cases
of
crucifixion
devatat
of
siam
ixion
of
rome
apollonius
of
tyana
in
cappadocia
are
all
reported
in
history
as
having
died
the
death
of
the
cross
ixion
according
to
nimrod
was
crucified
on
a
wheel
the
rim
representing
the
world
and
the
spokes
constituting
the
cross
it
is
declared
he
bore
the
burden
of
the
world
that
is
the
sins
of
the
world
on
his
back
while
suspended
on
the
cross
hence
he
was
sometimes
called
the
crucified
spirit
of
the
world
with
respect
to
apollonius
it
is
a
remarkable
if
not
a
suspicious
circumstance
that
should
not
be
passed
unnoticed
that
several
christian
writers
while
they
recount
a
long
list
of
miracles
and
remarkable
incidents
in
the
life
of
this
cappadocian
savior
extending
through
his
whole
life
and
forming
a
parallel
to
similar
incidents
of
the
christian
savior
not
a
word
is
said
about
his
crucifixion
and
a
similar
policy
has
been
pursued
with
respect
to
mithra
and
other
gods
including
chrishna
and
prometheus
as
before
noticed
this
important
chapter
in
their
history
has
been
omitted
by
christian
writers
for
fear
the
relation
of
it
would
damage
the
credibility
of
the
crucifixion
of
christ
or
lessen
its
spiritual
force
for
like
paul
they
were
determined
to
know
nothing
but
jesus
christ
and
him
crucified
i
cor
ii
to
no
other
god
had
been
crucified
but
they
thus
exalted
the
tradition
of
the
crucifixion
into
the
most
important
dogma
of
the
christian
faith
hence
their
efforts
to
conceal
from
the
public
a
knowledge
of
the
fact
that
it
is
of
pagan
origin
by
reference
to
mackey
lexicon
of
freemasonry
we
learn
that
freemasons
secretly
taught
the
doctrine
of
the
crucifixion
atonement
and
resurrection
long
anterior
to
the
christian
era
and
that
similar
doctrines
were
taught
in
all
the
ancient
mysteries
thus
proving
that
the
conception
of
these
tenets
of
faith
existed
at
a
very
early
period
of
time
and
it
may
be
noted
here
that
the
doctrine
of
salvation
by
crucifixion
had
likewise
with
most
of
the
ancient
forms
of
religious
faith
an
astronomical
representation
a
representation
in
astronomical
symbols
according
to
the
emblematical
figures
comprised
in
their
astral
worship
people
were
saved
by
the
sun
crucifixion
or
crossification
realized
by
over
the
equinoctial
line
into
the
season
of
spring
and
thereby
gave
out
a
saving
heat
and
light
to
the
world
and
stimulated
the
generative
organs
of
animal
and
vegetable
life
it
was
from
this
conception
that
the
ancients
were
in
the
habit
of
carving
or
painting
the
organs
of
generation
upon
the
walls
of
their
holy
temples
the
blood
of
the
grape
which
was
ripened
by
the
heat
of
the
sun
as
he
crossed
over
by
resurrection
into
spring
was
crucified
was
symbolically
the
blood
of
the
cross
or
the
blood
of
the
lamb
if
we
should
be
met
here
with
the
statement
that
the
stories
of
the
ancient
crucifixions
of
gods
were
mere
myths
or
fables
unwarrantably
saddled
on
to
their
histories
as
mere
romance
and
have
no
foundation
in
fact
we
reply
there
is
as
much
ground
for
suspecting
the
same
thing
as
being
true
of
jesus
christ
one
of
the
most
celebrated
and
most
frequently
quoted
christian
writers
of
the
ancient
bishops
irenæus
declares
upon
the
authority
of
the
martyr
polycarp
who
claimed
to
have
got
it
from
john
and
all
the
elders
of
asia
that
jesus
christ
was
not
crucified
but
lived
to
be
about
fifty
years
old
we
find
there
has
always
been
a
margin
for
doubt
amongst
his
own
followers
as
to
the
fact
of
his
crucifixion
many
of
the
early
christians
and
cotemporary
jews
and
gentiles
doubted
it
and
some
openly
disputed
its
ever
having
taken
place
others
bestowed
upon
it
a
mere
spiritual
signification
and
not
a
few
considered
it
symbolical
of
a
holy
life
one
circumstance
calculated
to
lead
to
the
entire
discredit
of
the
story
of
the
crucifixion
of
christ
is
the
relation
in
connection
with
it
of
a
violent
convulsion
of
nature
and
the
resurrection
of
the
saints
events
not
supported
by
any
authentic
cotemporaneous
history
sacred
or
profane
see
chap
aphanasia
and
as
these
events
must
be
set
down
as
fabulous
they
leave
the
mind
in
doubt
with
respect
to
the
fact
of
the
crucifixion
itself
especially
when
the
many
absurdities
involved
in
the
doctrine
of
the
crucifixion
are
brought
to
view
in
connection
with
it
some
of
them
so
palpably
erroneous
that
an
unlettered
savage
could
see
and
point
them
out
the
indian
chief
red
jacket
is
reported
to
have
replied
to
the
christian
missionaries
when
they
urged
upon
his
attention
the
benefits
of
christ
death
by
crucifixion
brethren
if
you
white
men
murdered
the
son
of
the
great
spirit
we
indians
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
and
it
is
none
of
our
affair
if
he
had
come
among
us
we
would
not
have
killed
him
we
would
have
treated
him
well
you
must
make
amends
for
that
crime
yourselves
this
view
of
the
crucifixion
suggested
to
the
mind
of
an
illiterate
heathen
we
deem
more
sensible
and
rational
than
that
of
the
orthodox
christians
which
makes
it
a
meritorious
act
and
a
moral
necessity
for
this
would
not
only
exonerate
judas
from
any
criminality
or
guilt
for
the
part
he
took
in
the
affair
but
would
entitle
him
as
well
as
christ
to
the
honorable
title
of
a
savior
for
performing
an
act
without
which
the
crucifixion
and
consequent
salvation
of
the
world
could
not
have
been
effected
if
it
was
necessary
for
christ
to
suffer
death
upon
the
cross
as
an
atonement
for
sin
then
the
act
of
crucifixion
was
right
and
a
monument
should
be
erected
to
the
memory
of
judas
for
bringing
it
about
we
challenge
christian
logic
to
find
a
flaw
in
this
argument
and
another
important
consideration
arises
here
if
the
inhabitants
of
this
planet
required
the
murderous
death
of
a
god
as
an
atonement
we
must
presume
that
the
millions
of
inhabited
worlds
recently
discovered
by
astronomers
are
or
have
been
in
equal
need
of
a
divine
atonement
and
this
would
require
the
crucifixion
of
millions
of
gods
assuming
one
of
these
gods
to
be
crucified
every
minute
the
whole
would
occupy
a
period
of
nearly
twenty
years
this
would
be
killing
off
gods
at
rather
a
rapid
rate
and
would
make
the
work
of
the
atonement
and
salvation
a
very
murderous
and
bloody
affair
a
conception
which
brings
to
the
mind
a
series
of
very
revolting
reflections
the
conception
of
gods
coming
down
from
heaven
and
being
born
of
virgins
and
dying
a
violent
death
for
the
moral
blunders
of
the
people
originated
in
an
age
of
the
world
when
man
was
a
savage
and
dwelt
exclusively
upon
the
animal
plane
and
blood
was
the
requisition
for
every
offense
and
it
was
an
age
when
no
world
was
known
to
exist
but
the
one
we
inhabit
the
stars
were
then
supposed
to
be
mere
blazing
tapers
set
in
the
azure
vault
to
light
this
pygmy
planet
or
for
gods
to
look
out
of
heaven
to
see
and
learn
what
is
going
on
below
such
conceptions
are
in
perfect
keeping
with
the
doctrine
of
the
atoning
crucifixion
of
gods
which
could
never
have
originated
or
been
entertained
for
a
moment
by
an
astronomer
with
a
knowledge
of
the
existence
of
innumerable
inhabited
worlds
for
as
there
is
to
the
monotheistic
christian
but
one
god
or
son
of
god
to
be
offered
he
must
be
incarnated
and
crucified
every
day
for
a
thousand
years
to
make
a
for
each
of
these
worlds
a
conception
too
monstrous
and
preposterous
to
find
a
lodgment
in
a
rational
mind
origin
of
the
belief
of
the
crucifixion
of
gods
it
has
always
been
presumed
that
death
and
especially
death
by
crucifixion
involved
the
highest
state
of
suffering
possible
to
be
endured
by
mortals
hence
the
gods
must
suffer
in
this
way
as
an
example
of
courage
and
fortitude
and
to
show
themselves
willing
to
undergo
all
the
affliction
and
misery
incident
to
the
lot
and
unavoidable
to
the
lives
of
their
devoted
worshipers
they
must
not
only
be
equal
but
superior
to
their
subjects
in
this
respect
hence
they
would
not
merely
die
but
choose
or
at
least
uncomplainingly
submit
to
the
most
ignoble
and
ignominious
mode
of
suffering
death
that
could
be
devised
and
that
was
crucifixion
this
gave
the
highest
finishing
touch
to
the
drama
and
thus
the
legend
of
the
crucifixion
became
the
crowning
chapter
the
aggrandizing
episode
in
the
history
of
their
lives
it
was
presumed
that
nothing
less
than
a
god
could
endure
such
excruciating
tortures
without
complaining
hence
when
the
victim
was
reported
to
have
submitted
with
such
fortitude
that
no
murmur
was
heard
to
issue
from
his
lips
this
circumstance
of
itself
was
deemed
sufficient
evidence
of
his
godship
the
story
of
the
crucifixion
therefore
whether
true
or
false
deified
or
helped
deify
many
great
men
and
exalt
them
to
the
rank
of
gods
though
some
of
the
disciples
of
budhism
and
some
of
the
primitive
professors
of
christianity
also
including
according
to
christian
history
peter
and
his
brother
andrew
voluntarily
chose
this
mode
of
dying
in
imitation
of
their
crucified
lord
without
experiencing
however
the
desired
promotion
to
divine
honors
they
failed
of
an
exaltation
to
the
deityship
and
hence
are
not
now
worshiped
as
gods
christian
reader
what
can
you
now
make
of
the
story
of
the
crucifixion
of
jesus
christ
but
a
borrowed
legend
at
least
the
story
of
his
being
crucified
a
god
the
author
desires
it
to
be
understood
with
respect
to
the
cases
of
crucifixion
here
briefly
narrated
that
they
are
not
vouched
foras
actual
occurrences
of
which
there
is
much
ground
to
doubt
it
has
neither
been
his
aim
or
desire
to
prove
them
to
be
real
historical
events
nor
to
establish
any
certain
number
of
cases
indeed
he
deems
it
unimportant
to
know
if
it
could
be
determined
whether
they
are
fact
or
fiction
or
whether
one
god
was
crucified
or
many
the
moral
lesson
designed
to
be
taught
by
this
chapter
is
simply
that
the
belief
in
the
crucifixion
of
gods
was
prevalent
in
various
oriental
or
heathen
countries
long
prior
to
the
reported
crucifixion
of
christ
if
this
point
is
established
which
he
feels
certain
no
reader
will
dispute
then
he
is
not
concerned
to
know
whether
he
has
made
out
sixteen
cases
of
crucifixion
or
not
six
will
prove
it
as
well
as
sixteen
in
fact
one
case
is
sufficient
to
establish
the
important
proposition
in
view
the
reader
is
therefore
left
to
decide
each
case
for
himself
according
as
he
may
value
the
evidence
presented
more
authorities
could
have
been
adduced
and
a
more
extended
history
presented
of
each
god
brought
to
notice
but
this
would
have
operated
to
exclude
other
matter
which
the
author
considers
of
more
importance
chapter
xvii
the
aphanasia
or
darkness
at
the
crucifixion
matthew
tells
us
xxvii
that
when
christ
was
crucified
there
was
darkness
all
over
the
land
for
three
hours
and
the
earth
did
quake
and
the
rocks
were
rent
and
many
of
the
saints
came
out
of
their
graves
here
we
have
a
series
of
events
spoken
of
so
strange
so
unusual
and
so
extraordinary
that
had
they
occurred
they
must
have
attracted
the
attention
of
the
whole
world
especially
the
amazing
scene
of
the
withdrawing
his
light
and
ceasing
to
shine
and
thereby
causing
an
almost
total
darkness
near
the
middle
of
the
day
and
yet
no
writer
of
that
age
or
country
or
any
other
age
or
country
mentions
the
circumstance
but
matthew
a
phenomenon
so
terrible
and
so
serious
in
its
effects
as
literally
to
unhinge
the
planets
and
partially
disorganize
the
universe
must
have
excited
the
alarm
and
amazement
of
the
whole
world
and
caused
a
serious
disturbance
in
the
affairs
of
nations
and
yet
strange
superlatively
strange
not
one
of
the
numerous
historians
of
that
age
makes
the
slightest
allusion
to
such
an
astounding
event
even
seneca
and
the
elder
pliny
who
so
particularly
and
minutely
chronicle
the
events
of
those
times
are
as
silent
as
the
grave
relative
to
this
greatest
event
in
the
history
of
the
world
nor
do
mark
luke
or
john
who
all
furnish
us
with
a
history
of
the
crucifixion
make
the
slightest
hint
at
any
of
these
events
except
incidental
allusion
to
the
darkness
gibbon
says
it
happened
during
the
life
of
seneca
and
the
elder
pliny
who
must
have
experienced
its
immediate
effects
or
received
the
earliest
intelligence
of
the
prodigy
each
of
these
philosophers
in
a
labored
work
has
recorded
all
the
phenomena
of
nature
earthquakes
meteors
and
eclipses
which
his
indefatigable
curiosity
could
collect
both
the
one
and
the
other
have
omitted
to
mention
the
greatest
phenomenon
to
which
the
mortal
eye
has
been
witness
since
the
creation
of
the
world
gibbon
p
with
reference
to
the
bodies
of
the
dead
saints
coming
out
of
their
tombs
for
it
is
declared
their
bodies
arose
see
matt
xxvii
many
rather
curious
and
puzzling
questions
might
be
started
which
would
at
once
disclose
its
utter
absurdity
we
might
ask
for
example
who
were
those
many
saints
who
came
out
of
their
graves
seeing
there
were
as
yet
but
few
christians
to
occupy
graves
if
they
had
been
all
dead
as
the
enumeration
at
antioch
made
out
only
one
hundred
and
twenty
see
acts
how
long
had
they
lain
in
their
graves
how
long
since
their
bodies
had
turned
to
dust
and
been
food
for
worms
and
would
not
those
worms
have
to
be
hunted
up
and
required
to
disgorge
the
contents
of
their
stomachs
in
order
to
furnish
the
saints
with
the
materials
for
their
bodies
again
and
were
the
shrouds
or
grave
clothes
of
those
saints
also
resurrected
or
did
they
travel
about
in
a
state
of
nudity
for
what
purpose
were
they
and
should
not
matthew
have
furnished
us
by
way
of
proof
with
the
names
of
some
of
these
ghostly
visitors
how
long
did
they
live
the
second
time
did
they
die
again
or
did
they
ascend
to
heaven
with
their
bodies
what
business
did
they
engage
in
why
have
we
not
some
account
of
what
they
said
and
did
and
what
finally
became
of
them
until
these
questions
are
rationally
answered
the
story
must
be
regarded
as
too
incredible
and
too
ludicrous
to
merit
serious
notice
nearly
all
the
phenomena
represented
as
occurring
at
the
crucifixion
of
christ
are
reported
to
have
been
witnessed
also
at
the
final
exit
of
senerus
an
ancient
pagan
demigod
who
figured
in
history
at
a
still
more
remote
period
of
time
and
similar
incidents
are
related
likewise
in
the
legendary
histories
of
several
other
heathen
demigods
and
great
men
partially
promoted
to
the
honor
of
gods
in
the
records
of
the
oldest
religion
in
the
world
it
is
declared
a
cloud
surrounded
the
moon
and
the
sun
was
darkened
at
noonday
and
the
sky
rained
fire
and
ashes
during
the
crucifixion
of
the
indian
god
chrishna
in
the
case
of
osiris
of
egypt
southwell
says
as
his
birth
had
been
attended
by
an
eclipse
of
the
sun
so
his
death
was
attended
by
a
still
greater
darkness
of
the
solar
orb
at
the
critical
juncture
of
the
crucifixion
of
prometheus
it
is
declared
the
whole
frame
of
nature
became
convulsed
the
earth
shook
the
rocks
were
rent
the
graves
opened
and
in
a
storm
which
threatened
the
dissolution
of
the
universe
the
scene
closed
higgins
according
to
livy
the
last
hours
of
the
mortal
demise
of
romulus
were
marked
by
a
storm

by
a
solar
eclipse

similar
stories
are
furnished
us
by
several
writers
of
cæsar
and
alexander
the
great
with
respect
to
the
latter
nimrod
says
six
hours
of
darkness
formed
his
aphanasia
and
his
soul
like
polycarp
was
seen
to
fly
away

the
form
of
a

nimrod
vol
iii
p
it
is
remarkable
says
a
writer
what
a
host
of
respectable
authorities
vouch
for
an
acknowledged
fable
the
preternatural
darkness
which
followed
cæsar
death
gibbon
alludes
to
this
event
when
he
speaks
of
the
singular
defect
of
light
which
followed
the
murder
of
caesar
he
likewise
says
this
season
of
darkness
had
already
been
celebrated
by
most
of
the
poets
and
historians
of
that
memorable
age
gibbon
p
it
is
very
remarkable
that
pliny
speaks
of
a
darkness
attending
cæsar
death
but
omits
to
mention
such
a
scene
as
attending
the
crucifixion
of
christ
virgil
also
seeks
to
exalt
this
royal
personage
by
relating
this
prodigy
see
his
georgius
p
another
writer
says
similar
prodigies
were
supposed
or
said
to
accompany
the
great
men
of
former
days
let
the
reader
make
a
note
of
this
fact
that
the
same
story
was
told
of
the
graves
opening
and
the
dead
rising
at
the
final
mortal
exit
of
several
heathen
gods
and
several
great
men
long
before
it
was
penned
as
a
chapter
in
the
history
of
christ
shakespeare
in
his
hamlet
says
in
the
most
high
and
palmy
days
of
rome
a
little
ere
the
mighty
julius
fell
the
graves
stood
tenantless
and
the
sheeted
dead
did
squeak
and
gibber
in
the
roman
streets
these
historical
citations
strongly
press
the
conclusion
that
this
portion
of
the
history
of
christ
was
borrowed
from
old
pagan
legends
many
cases
are
recorded
in
history
of
the
light
of
the
sun
being
obscured
at
midday
so
as
to
result
in
almost
total
darkness
when
it
was
known
not
to
be
produced
by
an
eclipse
and
it
is
probable
that
these
natural
events
furnish
the
basis
in
part
for
those
wild
legends
we
have
brought
to
notice
humboldt
relates
in
his
cosmos
that
in
the
year
before
the
earthquake
of
numidia
the
darkness
was
very
dense
for
two
or
three
hours
another
obscuration
of
the
sun
took
place
in
the
year
which
lasted
five
or
six
hours
and
was
so
dense
that
the
stars
were
visible
at
midday
another
circumstance
of
this
kind
was
witnessed
on
the
nineteenth
of
may
which
lasted
eight
hours
and
so
great
was
the
darkness
that
candles
and
lamps
had
to
be
lighted
at
midday
to
dine
by
similar
events
are
chronicled
for
the
years
and
and
if
any
such
solar
obscurations
occurred
near
the
mortal
exit
of
any
of
the
gods
above
named
of
course
they
would
be
seized
on
as
a
part
of
their
practical
history
wrought
up
into
hyperbole
and
interwoven
in
their
narratives
to
give
eclat
to
the
pageantry
of
their
biographies
a
fact
which
helps
to
solve
the
mystery
origin
of
the
story
of
the
aphanasia
at
the
crucifixion
there
is
but
little
ground
to
doubt
but
that
the
various
stories
of
a
similar
character
then
current
in
different
countries
as
shown
above
first
suggested
the
thought
to
christ
biographers
of
investing
history
with
the
incredible
events
reported
as
being
connected
with
the
crucifixion
the
principal
motive
however
seems
to
have
grown
out
of
a
desire
to
fulfill
a
prophecy
of
the
jewish
prophet
joel
as
we
may
find
many
of
the
important
miraculous
events
ingrafted
into
christ
history
were
recorded
by
way
of
fulfilling
some
prophecy
that
the
prophecy
might
be
fulfilled
is
the
very
language
his
evangelical
biographers
use
joel
prediction
runs
thus
and
i
will
show
wonders
in
the
heavens
and
in
the
earth
flood
and
fire
and
pillars
of
smoke
the
sun
shall
be
turned
into
darkness
and
the
moon
into
blood
before
the
great
and
terrible
day
of
the
lord
come
joel
ii
a
little
impartial
investigation
will
satisfy
any
unprejudiced
mind
that
this
poetic
rhapsody
has
not
the
most
remote
allusion
to
the
closing
events
in
the
life
of
christ
and
was
not
intended
to
have
but
his
biographers
writing
a
long
time
after
his
death
supposing
and
assuming
that
this
and
various
other
texts
which
they
quote
from
the
prophets
had
reference
to
him
and
had
been
fulfilled
incorporated
it
into
his
history
as
a
part
of
his
practical
life
the
conviction
that
the
prophecy
have
been
without
knowing
that
it
had
added
to
similar
stories
of
other
gods
with
which
christ
history
became
confounded
misled
them
into
the
conclusion
that
they
were
warranted
in
assuming
that
the
incredible
events
they
name
were
really
witnessed
at
the
mortal
termination
of
christ
earthly
career
when
they
did
not
know
it
and
could
not
have
known
it
this
view
of
the
case
becomes
very
rational
and
very
forcible
when
we
observe
various
texts
quoted
from
the
prophets
by
the
gospel
writers
or
rather
most
butcheringly
misquoted
tortured
or
distorted
into
messianic
prophecies
when
the
context
shows
they
have
no
reference
to
christ
whatever
chapter
xviii
descent
of
the
saviors
into
hell
the
next
most
important
event
in
the
histories
of
the
saviors
after
their
crucifixion
and
the
act
of
giving
up
the
ghost
is
that
of
their
descent
into
the
infernal
regions
that
jesus
christ
descended
into
hell
after
his
crucifixion
is
not
expressly
taught
in
the
christian
bible
but
it
is
a
matter
of
such
obvious
inference
from
several
passages
of
scripture
the
early
christians
taught
it
as
a
scriptural
doctrine
sears
a
christian
writer
tells
us
that
on
the
doctrine
of
underground
mission
the
early
christians
were
united
it
was
a
point
too
well
settled
to
admit
of
dispute
see
foregleams
of
immortality
and
besides
this
testimony
the
apostles
creed
teaches
the
doctrine
explicitly
which
was
once
as
good
authority
throughout
christendom
as
the
bible
itself
indeed
it
may
be
considered
as
constituting
a
part
of
the
bible
prior
to
the
council
of
nice
being
supposed
to
have
been
written
by
the
apostles
themselves
it
declares
that
jesus
christ
suffered
under
pontius
pilate
was
crucified
dead
and
buried
he
descended
into
hell
the
third
day
he
rose
again
from
the
dead
etc
this
testimony
is
very
explicit
and
peter
is
supposed
to
refer
to
the
same
event
when
he
says
being
put
to
death
in
the
flesh
but
quickened
by
the
spirit
by
which
also
he
went
and
preached
unto
the
spirits
in
prison
i
peter
iii
the
word
prison
which
occurs
in
this
text
has
undoubted
reference
to
the
christian
fabled
hell
for
no
possible
sense
can
be
attached
to
the
word
prison
in
this
connection
without
such
a
construction
where
have
spirits
ever
been
supposed
to
be
imprisoned
but
in
hell
and
then
we
find
a
text
in
the
acts
of
the
apostles
which
seems
to
remove
all
doubt
in
the
case
and
banishes
at
once
all
ground
for
dispute
it
is
explicitly
stated
that
his
soul
was
not
left
in
hell
neither
did
his
flesh
see
corruption
adis
ii
why
talk
about
his
soul
not
being
left
in
hell
if
it
had
never
been
there
language
could
hardly
be
plainer
the
most
positive
declaration
that
christ
did
descend
into
hell
could
not
make
it
more
certainly
a
scriptural
christian
doctrine
we
then
rest
the
case
here
and
proceed
to
enumerate
other
cases
of
gods
and
saviors
descending
into
pandemonium
the
realms
of
pluto
long
before
jesus
christ
walked
on
the
water
or
on
the
earth
it
is
unquestionably
stated
in
the
hindoo
bible
written
more
than
three
thousand
years
ago
that
the
savior
chrishna
went
down
to
hell
to
preach
to
the
inmates
of
that
dark
and
dreary
prison
with
the
view
of
reforming
them
and
getting
them
back
to
heaven
and
was
willing
himself
to
suffer
to
abridge
the
period
of
their
torment
and
certainly
in
the
midst
of
the
fire
and
smoke
of
brimstone
it
could
not
have
been
hard
to
effect
their
conversion
or
repentance
one
writer
tells
us
that
so
great
was
his
chrishna
tenderness
that
he
even
descended
into
hell
to
teach
souls
in
bondage
now
observe
how
much
teaching
souls
in
bondage
sounds
like
preaching
to
souls
in
prison
as
peter
represents
christ
as
doing
and
can
any
reader
doubt
that
the
meaning
in
the
two
cases
is
the
same
and
must
we
not
confess
that
we
are
greatly
indebted
to
the
hindoo
bible
for
an
explanation
of
the
two
occult
and
mysterious
texts
which
i
have
quoted
from
the
christian
bible
and
which
have
puzzled
so
many
learned
critics
to
explain
or
find
a
meaning
for
we
have
another
case
of
a
god
descending
into
hell
in
the
person
or
spirit
of
the
savior
quexalcote
of
mexico
the
story
will
be
found
in
the
codex
borgianus
wherein
is
related
the
account
of
his
death
and
burial
after
crucifixion
his
descent
into
hell
and
subsequent
resurrection
of
adonis
of
greece
it
is
declared
that
after
his
descent
into
hell
he
rose
again
to
life
and
immortality
prometheus
of
caucasus
likewise
is
represented
as
suffering
and
descending
into
hell
rising
again
from
the
dead
and
ascending
to
heaven
horus
of
greece
is
described
as
first
reigning
a
thousand
years
then
dying
and
being
buried
for
three
days
at
the
end
of
which
time
he
triumphed
over
typhon
the
evil
principle
and
rose
again
to
life
evermore
and
osiris
of
egypt
also
is
represented
as
making
a
descent
into
hell
and
after
a
period
of
three
days
rose
again
homer
and
virgil
speak
of
several
cases
of
descent
into
dominions
hercules
ulysses
and
æneas
are
represented
as
performing
the
hellward
journey
on
as
we
infer
benevolent
missions
higgins
remarks
the
gods
became
incarnate
and
descended
into
hell
to
teach
humility
and
set
an
example
of
suffering
the
story
of
their
descent
into
hell
was
doubtless
invented
to
find
employment
for
them
during
their
three
days
of
hibernation
or
conservation
in
the
tomb
that
they
might
not
appear
to
be
really
dead
nor
idle
in
the
time
and
as
a
still
further
proof
of
their
matchless
and
unrivalled
capacity
and
fortitude
for
suffering
and
the
story
of
the
three
days
entombment
is
likewise
clearly
traceable
in
appearance
to
the
astronomical
incident
of
the
sun
lying
apparently
dead
and
buried
and
motionless
for
nearly
three
days
at
the
period
of
the
vernal
epoch
from
the
to
the
of
march
it
was
a
matter
of
belief
or
fancy
that
the
sun
remained
stationary
for
about
three
days
when
he
gradually
rose
again
into
newness
of
life
and
hence
this
period
or
era
was
chosen
to
figuratively
represent
the
three
days
descent
of
the
gods
into
hell
we
are
told
that
the
persians
have
an
ancient
astronomical
figure
representing
the
descent
of
a
god
divine
into
hell
and
returning
at
the
time
that
orsus
the
goddess
of
spring
had
conquered
the
god
or
genus
of
winter
after
the
manner
john
describes
the
lamb
of
god
see
rev
xii
as
conquering
the
dragon
which
may
be
interpreted
as
the
scorpion
or
dragon
of
the
first
month
of
winter
october
being
conquered
by
the
lamb

resurrection
of

find
presented

the
canonized
histories
of
several
of
the

the
following
remarkable
coincidences
appertaining
to
their

tomb
just
three
days
the
resurrection
of
several
of
them
about
the
time
of
the
vernal
equinox
the
of
march
is
the
period
assigned
by
the
christian
world
generally
for
the
resurrection
of
christ
though
some
christian
writers
have
assigned
other
dates
for
this
event
they
all
agree
however
that
christ
rose
from
the
dead
and
that
this
occurred
three
days
after
the
entombment
bishop
theophilus
of
cesarea
remarks
relative
to
this
event
since
the
birth
of
christ
is
celebrated
on
the
of
december
so
also
should
the
resurrection
of
jesus
be
celebrated
on
the
of

day
of

may
fall

the
of
march
was
with
the
ancient
persians
the
commencement
of
a
new
year
and
on
that
day
was
celebrated
the
feast
of
the
neurone
and
by
the
ancient
romans
the
festival
of
the
hilaria
and
we
find
the
ancients
had
both
the
crucifixion
and
resurrection
of
a
god
symbolically
and
astronomically
represented
among
the
plants
their
foundation
says
clement
of
alexandria
was
the
fictitious
death
and
resurrection
of
the
sun
the
soul
of
the
world
the
principle
of
life
and
motion
the
inauguration
of
spring
the
of
march
and
the
summer
solstice
the
of
june
were
both
important
periods
with
the
ancients
hence
the
latter
period
was
fixed
on
as
the
birthday
of
john
the
baptist
as
marked
in
the
almanacs
when
the
sun
begins
to
decline
southward
that
is
decrease
how
appropriately
therefore
john
is
made
to
say
i
shall
decrease
but
he
shall
increase
and
the
consecrated
of
march
is
also
the
day
marked
in
our
calendars
as
the
date
of
the
conception
and
annunciation
of
the
blessed
virgin
mary
and
it
was
likewise
the
period
of
the
conception
of
the
ancient
roman
virgin
asteria
and
of
the
and
holy
virgin
iris
as
well
as
the
time
of
the
conjugal
embrace
of
the
solar
and
lunar
potentates
of
the
visible
universe
may
we
not
then
very
appropriately
exclaim
of
religion
and
astronomy
what
god
hath
joined
together
let
no
man
put
asunder
resurrection
of
jesus
christ
with
respect
to
the
physical
resurrection
of
the
christian
savior
it
may
be
observed
that
aside
from
the
physical
impossibility
of
such
an
occurrence
the
account
as
reported
to
us
by
his
four
inspired
gospel
biographers
are
so
palpably
at
variance
with
each
other
so
entirely
contradictory
in
their
reports
as
to
render
their
testimony
as
infallible
writers
utterly
unworthy
of
credence
and
impels
us
to
the
conclusion
that
the
event
is
both
physically
and
historically
incredible
there
is
scarcely
one
incident
or
particular
in
which
they
all
agree
they
are
at
loggerheads
with
respect
to
the
time
of
its
discovery
the
persons
who
made
the
discovery
for
no
witness
claims
to
have
seen
it
with
respect
to
what
took
place
at
the
sepulchre
what
peter
saw
and
did
there
and
as
to
what
occurred
afterward
having
a
relation
to
that
event
relative
to
the
time
the
witness
or
witnesses
visited
the
sepulchre
and
learned
of
the
resurrection
matthew
chap
xxviii
tells
us
it
was
at
the
end
of
the
sabbath
as
it
began
to
dawn
but
according
to
mark
xvi
the
sabbath
was
past
and
the
sun
was
rising
while
john
chap
xx
declares
it
was
yet
dark
now
there
is
certainly
some
difference
between
the
three
periods
the
dawning
of
the
day
the
rising
of
the
sun
and
the
darkness
of
night
if
the
writers
were
inspired
there
would
be
a
perfect
agreement
with
respect
to
the
persons
who
first
visited
the
sepulchre
matthew
states
that
it
was
mary
magdalene
and
another
mary
but
luke
says
it
was
mary
magdalene
and
joanna
and
mary
the
mother
of
james
and
other
women
while
according
to
john
and
he
virtually
reiterates
it
mary
magdalene
went
alone
it
will
be
observed
then
that
the
first
inspired
and
infallible
witness
testifies
there
were
two
women
the
second
that
there
were
four
and
the
third
witness
declares
there
was
but
one
what
beautiful
harmony
no
court
in
the
civilized
world
would
accept
such
discordant
testimony
and
in
relation
to
what
took
place
at
the
tomb
matthew
testifies
that
the
angel
of
the
lord
sat
upon
a
stone
at
the
door
of
the
sepulchre
and
told
the
women
their
lord
was
risen
but
luke
steps
forward
here
and
avers
that
instead
of
an
angel
they
found
two
men
there
not
outside
but
inside
and
not
sitting
but
standing
but
mark
sets
the
testimony
of
both
these
inspired
witnesses
aside
by
affirming
there
was
but
one
man
there
and
he
was
sitting
while
matthew
says
they
john
says
she
speaking
of
the
person
or
persons
who
left
the
sepulchre
according
to
matthew
the
angel
who
rolled
away
the
stone
from
the
sepulchre
sent
a
message
to
the
disciples
but
mark
affirms
that
it
was
not
an
angel
outside
but
a
young
man
inside
who
did
this
and
here
the
question
naturally
arises
why
was
it
necessary
for
a
being
who
could
say
i
have
power
to
lay
down
my
life
and
take
it
up
again
john
to
have
an
angel
to
roll
away
the
stone
from
the
sepulchre
certainly
if
he
possessed
such
omnipotent
power
he
needed
no
aid
from
any
being
to
perform
such
an
act
and
relative
to
peter
visit
to
the
tomb
there
is
a
total
disparity
in
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses
according
to
luke
he
did
not
go
into
the
sepulchre
but
only
stooped
down
and
looked
in
but
mark
affirms
he
did
go
in
and
that
it
was
the
disciple
who
went
with
him
who
stooped
down
and
with
respect
to
the
events
which
occurred
immediately
subsequent
to
the
resurrection
there
is
no
less
discrepancy
no
nearer
agreement
in
the
testimony
of
the
evangelical
witnesses
matthew
says
that
when
christ
disciples
first
met
him
after
the
resurrection
they
worshiped
him
and
held
him
by
the
feet
matt
xxviii
strange
indeed
and
wholly
incredible
if
john
is
a
reliable
witness
for
he
affirms
he
did
not
allow
even
his
best
and
dearest
friend
mary
to
touch
him
and
then
john
combats
this
testimony
of
his
by
declaring
he
invited
the
skeptical
thomas
not
only
to
touch
him
but
to
thrust
his
hand
into
his
side
for
tangible
proof
of
his
identity
and
why
let
us
ask
here
was
not
the
skeptical
thomas
damned
for
his
doubting
when
we
who
live
thousands
of
miles
from
the
place
and
nearly
two
thousand
years
from
the
time
are
often
told
by
the
priesthood
we
must
believe
or
be
damned
and
if
thomas
was
really
convinced
by
this
occurrence
or
if
it
ever
took
place
why
have
we
no
account
of
his
subsequent
life
what
good
was
effected
by
his
convincement
if
he
never
said
or
did
anything
afterward
john
tells
us
mary
first
saw
christ
after
his
resurrection
at
the
tomb
but
matthew
says
it
was
on
her
way
home
she
first
saw
him
we
are
told
by
luke
xxiv
that
when
christ
appeared
to
his
disciples
on
a
certain
occasion
they
were
frightened
supposing
it
to
be
a
spirit
but
john
xx
says
they
were
glad
which
must
we
believe
according
to
matthew
the
disciples
were
all
present
on
this
occasion
but
according
to
john
thomas
was
not
there
here
let
it
be
noted
that
none
of
the
narrators
claim
to
have
seen
christ
rise
from
the
tomb
nor
to
have
got
it
from
anybody
who
did
see
it
the
only
proof
in
this
case
is
their
declaration
it
came
to
pass
and
we
are
prompted
to
ask
here
how
it
came
to
pass
that
the
chief
priests
and
pharisees
cherished
sufficient
faith
in
resurrection
to
set
a
watch
for
it
as
matthew
reports
when
his
own
disciples
were
too
faithless
in
such
an
event
to
be
present
or
to
believe
he
had
risen
after
the
report
reached
their
ears
for
we
are
told
some
doubted
see
matt
xxiii
and
how
came
matthew
to
know
the
soldiers
were
bribed
to
say
christ
body
was
stolen
away
by
his
disciples
when
the
disclosures
of
such
a
secret
would
have
been
death
under
the
roman
government
and
their
confession
of
being
asleep
as
related
by
matthew
would
have
subjected
them
to
the
same
fatal
penalty
by
the
civil
rulers
of
rome
and
if
the
soldiers
were
all
asleep
can
we
not
suggest
several
ways
the
body
may
have
disappeared
without
being
restored
to
life
and
here
we
would
ask
if
christ
rose
from
the
dead
in
order
to
convince
the
world
of
his
divine
power
why
did
not
the
event
take
place
in
public
why
was
it
seen
only
by
a
few
credulous
and
interested
disciples
and
if
such
an
astonishing
and
miraculous
event
did
occur
why
does
not
one
of
the
numerous
cotemporary
writers
of
those
times
make
any
allusion
to
it
neither
pliny
tacitus
nor
josephus
who
detail
the
events
very
minutely
not
only
of
those
times
but
of
that
very
country
says
a
word
about
such
a
occurrence
this
fact
of
itself
entirely
overthrows
the
credibility
of
the
story
and
the
fact
that
several
christian
sects
which
flourished
near
those
times
as
the
corinthians
and
carpocratians
rejected
the
story
in
toto
furnishes
another
powerful
argument
for
discrediting
it
and
then
add
to
this
fact
that
his
own
chosen
followers
were
upbraided
for
their
unbelief
in
the
matter
and
what
was
christ
doing
during
the
forty
days
between
his
resurrection
and
ascension
that
he
should
only
be
seen
a
few
times
and
but
a
few
minutes
at
a
time
and
by
but
a
few
persons
and
those
interested
and
we
would
ask
likewise
what
more
can
be
proved
by
physical
resurrection
than
that
of
the
resurrection
of
lazarus
the
widow
son
and
several
cases
related
in
the
old
testament
or
the
numerous
cases
reported
in
oriental
history
and
what
analogy
is
there
in
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
body
of
a
perfect
and
god
and
that
of
vile
man
and
why
should
christ
be
called
the
first
fruits
of
the
resurrection
when
so
many
cases
are
reported
as
occurring
before
his
and
why
do
christians
build
their
hopes
of
immortality
almost
entirely
upon
christ
alleged
resurrection
in
view
of
the
numerous
facts
we
have
cited
showing
it
to
be
a
mere
sandy
foundation
of
course
no
person
who
believes
in
modern
spiritualism
will
discredit
the
story
of
christ
being
visually
recognized
after
his
death
a
for
they
have
ocular
proof
that
many
such
cases
have
occurred
within
the
last
decade
of
years
but
it
is
the
story
of
his
physical
resurrection
we
are
combating
the
reanimation
of
his
flesh
and
bones
after
having
been
subjected
three
days
to
the
laws
of
decomposition
neither
science
nor
sense
can
indorse
such
a
story
it
was
a
very
easy
matter
and
very
natural
to
mistake
spiritual
body
for
his
physical
body
for
such
mistakes
have
been
made
a
thousand
times
in
the
world
history
is
it
not
strange
in
view
of
the
countless
defects
in
the
story
of
christ
physical
resurrection
as
enumerated
above
that
the
orthodox
christian
world
should
rely
upon
it
as
the
great
sheet
anchor
of
their
faith
and
as
their
chief
and
almost
their
only
hope
of
immortal
life
chapter

reappearance
and
ascension
of
the
saviors
many
cases
are
related
by
their
respective
sacred
narratives
of
the
ancient
saviors
and
other
beings
possessing
the
form
of
man
and
previously
recognized
as
men
reappearing
to
their
disciples
and
friends
after
having
been
consigned
to
the
tomb
for
three
days
or
a
longer
or
shorter
period
of
time
and
of
their
final
ascension
to
the
house
of
many
mansions
it
is
related
of
the
indian
or
hindoo
savior
chrishna
that
after
having
risen
from
the
dead
he
appeared
again
to
his
disciples
he
ascended
to
voiacantha
heaven
to
brahma
the
first
person
of
the
trinity
he
himself
being
the
second
and
that
as
he
ascended
all
men
saw
him
and
exclaimed
chrishna
soul
ascends
to
his
native
skies
and
it
is
further
related
that
attended
by
celestial
spirits
he
pursued
by
his
own
light
the
journey
between
earth
and
heaven
to
the
bright
paradise
whence
he
had
descended
of
the
ninth
incarnation
of
india
the
savior
sakia
it
is
declared
that
he
ascended
to
the
celestial
regions
and
his
pious
and
devout
disciples
point
the
skeptic
to
indelible
impressions
and
ineffaceable
footprints
on
the
rocks
of
a
high
mountain
as
an
imperishable
proof
of
the
declaration
that
he
took
his
last
leave
of
earth
and
made
his
ascent
from
that
point
it
is
related
of
the
crucified
prometheus
likewise
that
after
having
given
up
the
ghost
on
the
cross
descended
to
hell
christ
soul
was
not
left
in
hell
see
acts
ii
he
rose
again
from
the
dead
and
ascended
into
heaven
and
then
it
is
declared
of
the
egyptian
savior
alcides
that
after
having
been
seen
a
number
of
times
he
ascended
to
a
higher
life
going
up
like
elijah
in
a
chariot
of
fire
the
story
of
the
crucifixion
of
quexalcote
of
mexico
followed
by
his
burial
resurrection
and
ascension
is
distinctly
related
in
the

lord
kingsborough
admitted
to
be

than
two
thousand
years
old
of
laotsi
of

it
is
said
that
when
he
had
completed
his

he
ascended
bodily

that
having
completed
his
glorious
mission
on
earth
he
ascended
back
to
paradise
where
he
had
previously
existed
from
all

it
is
related
also
in
the
ancient
legends
that
the
savior
or
god
xamalxis
of
thrace
having
died
and
descended
beneath
the
earth
and
remained
there
three
years
made
his
appearance
again
in
the
fourth
year
after
his
death
as
he
had
previously
foretold
and
eventually
ascended
to
heaven
about
even
some
of
the
hindoo
saints
are
reported
in
their
holy
and
books
to
have
been
seen
ascending
to
heaven
and
impressions
on
the
rocks
are
shown
says
an
author
said
to
be
of
footprints
they
had
left
when
they
ascended
it
is
related
both
by
the
grecian
biographer
plutarch
in
his
life
of
romulus
and
by
a
roman
historian
that
the
great
founder
of

romulus
suddenly
ascended
in
a
tempest
during
a
solar
eclipse
about

julius

a

astronomical
version
of
the
story
before
dismissing
this
chapter
we
may
state
that
in
common
with
most
other
religious
conceptions
the
doctrine
of
the
ascension
has
in
the
ancient
legends
an
astronomical
representation
having
said
that
a
planet
was
buried
because
it
sunk
below
the
horizon
when
it
returned
to
light
and
gained
its
state
of
eminence
they
spoke
of
it
as
dead
risen
again
and
ascended
into
heaven
volney
p
what
is
the
story
of
the
ascension
of
christ
worth
in
view
of
these
ancient
pagan
traditions
of
earlier
origin
ascension
of
the
christian
savior
the
different
scriptural
accounts
of
the
ascension
of
christ
are
like
the
different
stories
of
the
resurrection
quite
contradictory
and
hence
entitled
to
as
little
credit
in
luke
xxiv
he
is
represented
as
ascending
on
the
evening
of
the
third
day
after
the
crucifixion
but
the
writer
of
acts
i
says
he
did
not
ascend
till
forty
days
after
his
resurrection
while
according
to
his
own
declaration
to
the
thief
on
the
cross
this
day
shalt
thou
be
with
me
in
paradise
he
must
have
ascended
on
the
same
day
of
his
crucifixion
which
statement
must
we
accept
as
inspired
or
what
is
proved
by
such
contradictory
testimony
which
must
we
believe
paul
declaration
that
he
was
seen
by
above
hundred
of
the
at
once
cor
xv
or
the
statement
of
the
author
of
the
acts
i
that
there
were
one
hundred
and
twenty
brethren
in
all
after
that
period
how
would
his
ascension
do
anything
toward
proving
his
divinity
unless
it
also
proves
the
divinity
of
enoch
and
elijah
who
are
reported
to
have
ascended
long
prior
to
that
era
as
these
stories
of
the
ascension
of
christ
according
to
lardner
were
written
many
years
after
his
crucifixion
is
it
not
hence
probable
they
grew
out
of
similar
stories
relative
to
the
heathen
gods
long
previously
prevalent
in
oriental
countries
as
these
gospel
writers
could
not
have
been
present
to
witness
the
ascension
as
it
must
have
occurred
before
their
time
of
active
life
does
not
this
fact
of
itself
seriously
damage
the
credibility
of
the
accounts
and
more
especially
as
neither
mark
nor
luke
who
are
the
only
reporters
of
the
occurrence
were
not
disciples
of
christ
at
the
time
while
matthew
and
john
who
were
say
nothing
about
it
another
fact
which
casts
a
shade
on
the
credibility
of
the
story
chapter
xxi
the
atonement
its
oriental
or
heathen
origin
there
were
various
practices
in
vogue
amongst
the
orientalists
which
originated
with
the
design
of
appeasing
the
anger
and
propitiating
the
favor
of
a
presumed
to
be
irascible
deity
most
of
these
practices
consisted
in
some
kind
of
sacrifice
or
destructive
offering
called
the
atonement
but
here
let
it
be
observed
that
the
doctrine
of
atonement
for
sin
by
sacrifice
was
unfolded
by
degrees
and
that
the
crucifixion
of
a
god
was
not
the
first
practical
exhibition
of
it
on
the
contrary
it
appears
to
have
commenced
with
the
most
valueless
or
cheapest
species
of
property
then
known
and
from
this
ascended
gradually
so
as
finally
to
embody
the
most
costly
commodities
and
did
not
stop
here
but
reached
forward
till
it
laid
its
murderous
hands
on
human
beings
and
immolated
them
upon
its
bloody
altars
and
finally
to
cap
the
climax
it
assumed
the
effrontery
to
drag
a
god
off
the
throne
of
heaven
to
stanch
its
spirit
as
evinced
by
declaration
without
the
shedding
of
blood
there
can
be
no
remission
of
sin
rather
a
bloody
doctrine
and
one
which
our
humanity
rejects
with
instinctive
horror
we
will
trace
the
doctrine
of
the
atonement
briefly
through
its
successive
stages
of
growth
and
development
the
idea
seems
to
have
started
very
early
in
the
practical
history
of
the
human
race
that
the
sacrifice
and
consequent
deprivation
of
earthly
goods
or
some
terrestial
enjoyment
would
have
the
effect
to
mitigate
the
anger
propitiate
the
favor
and
obtain
the
mercy
of
an
imaginary
and
vengeful
god
this
idea
obviously
was
suggested
by
observing
that
their
earthly
rulers
always
smiled
and
became
less
rigorous
in
their
laws
and
milder
in
their
treatment
of
their
subjects
when
they
made
them
presents
of
some
valuable
or
desirable
commodity
they
soon
learned
that
such
offerings
had
the
effect
to
check
their
cruel
and
bloody
mode
of
governing
the
people
so
that
when
their
houses
were
shaken
down
or
swallowed
up
by
earthquakes
the
trees
riven
by
lightning
and
prostrated
by
storms
and
their
cattle
swept
away
by
floods
supposing
it
to
be
the
work
of
an
angry
god
the
thought
arose
in
their
minds
at
once
that
perhaps
his
wrath
could
be
abated
by
the
same
expedient
as
that
which
had
served
in
the
case
of
their
mundane
lords
that
of
making
presents
of
property
but
as
this
property
could
not
be
carried
up
to
the
celestial
throne
the
expedient
was
adopted
of
burning
it
so
that
the
substance
or
quintessence
of
it
would
be
conveyed
up
to
the
heavenly
potentate
in
the
shape
of
steam
and
smoke
which
would
make
for
him
as
the
jews
express
it
a
savor
abundant
and
conspicuous
is
the
evidence
in
history
to
show
that
the
custom
of
and
atonements
for
sin
originated
in
this
way
the
first
species
of
property
made
use
of
for
appears
to
have
been
the
fruits
of
the
earth
vegetables
fruits
roots
the
lowest
kind
of
property
in
point
of
value
but
the
thought
soon
naturally
sprang
up
in
the
mind
of
the
devotee
that
a
more
valuable
offering
would
sooner
and
more
effectually
secure
the
divine
favor
hence
levies
were
made
on
living
herds
of
cattle
sheep
goats
and
other
domestic
animals
this
was
the
second
step
in
the
ascending
scale
toward
gods
and
here
we
find
the
key
to
open
and
solve
the
mystery
of
preferring
abel
offering
to
cain
while
the
latter
consisted
in
mere
inanimate
substances
the
former
embraced
the
firstlings
of
the
flock
a
higher
and
more
valuable
species
of
property
and
quite
sufficient
to
induce
the
selfish
jehovah
to
prefer
abel
offering
to
cain
or
rather
for
the
selfish
jews
to
cherish
this
conception
in
all
nations
where
offerings
were
made
the
conclusion
became
established
in
the
minds
of
the
people
that
the
amount
of
god
favor
procured
in
this
way
must
be
proportionate
to
the
value
of
the
commodity
or
victim
offered
up
a
conviction
which
ultimately
led
to
the
seizure
of
human
beings
for
the
atoning
offerings
which
brings
us
to
the
third
stage
of
growth
in
the
atonement
doctrine
children
frequently
constituted
the
victims
in
this
case
the
sacrifice
of
jephthah
daughter
as
related
in
judges
xi
and
other
cases
cited
by
bible
writers
isaiah
xxxii
and
modern
christian
authors
prove
that
this
practice
was
in
vogue
among
god
holy
people
one
step
more
constituting
the
stage
of
development
brings
us
to
the
sacrifice
of
gods
the
climax
is
now
reached
the
conception
can
go
no
higher
the
ancient
birmese
taught
that
while
common
property
in
would
procure
the
temporary
favor
of
the
ruling
god
the
sacrifice
of
human
beings
would
secure
his
good
pleasure
for
a
thousand
years
and
cancel
out
all
the
sins
committed
in
that
period
and
when
one
of
the
three
gods
on
the
throne
of
heaven
was
dragged
down
or
came
as
some
of
the
sects
taught
and
was
put
to
death
on
the
cross
as
an
atonement
for
sin
such
was
the
value
of
the
victim
such
the
magnitude
of
the
offering
that
it
atoned
for
sin
past
present
and
future
for
all
the
human
race
the
hindoos
cherishing
this
conception
taught
that
the
crucifixion
of
their
savior
chrishna
put
an
end
to
both
animal
and
human
sacrifices
and
accordingly
such
offerings
ceased
in
most
hindoo
countries
centuries
ago
thus
far
back
in
the
mire
and
midnight
of
human
ignorance
and
amid
the
clouds
of
mental
darkness
while
man
dwelt
upon
the
animal
plane
and
was
governed
by
his
brutal
feelings
and
blood
for
blood
was
the
requisition
for
human
offenses
originated
the
bloody
savage
and
revolting
doctrine
of
the
atonement
another
mode
of
adjudicating
the
sins
of
the
people
in
vogue
in
some
countries
anterior
to
the
custom
of
shedding
blood
as
an
expiation
was
that
of
packing
them
on
the
back
head
or
horns
of
some
animal
by
a
formal
process
and
then
driving
the
animal
into
a
wilderness
or
some
other
place
so
remote
that
the
brute
could
not
find
its
way
back
amongst
the
people
with
its
cargo
of
sins
the
cloth
or
fabric
used
for
inclosing
the
sins
and
iniquities
of
the
people
was
usually
of
a
red
or
scarlet
color
of
the
semblance
of
blood
in
fact
it
was
generally
dipped
in
blood
this
being
lashed
to
the
animal
would
of
course
be
exposed
to
the
weather
and
the
drenching
rains
would
consequently
in
the
course
of
time
fade
and
become
white
hence
we
have
the
key
to
isaiah
declaration
though
your
sins
be
red
as
scarlet
they
shall
become
white
as
wool
see
isaiah
i
and
thus
the
meaning
of
this
obscure
text
is
clearly
explained
by
tracing
its
origin
to
its
oriental
source
and
there
are
many
other
texts
in
the
christian
bible
which
might
be
elucidated
in
a
similar
manner
by
using
oriental
tradition
or
oriental
sacred
books
as
a
key
to
unlock
and
explain
their
meaning
we
have
stated
above
that
some
animal
was
made
use
of
by
different
nations
to
convey
the
imaginary
load
of
the
people
sins
out
of
the
country
for
this
purpose
the
jews
had
their
scapegoat
the
egyptians
their
the
hindoos
their
the
chaldeans
their
the
britons
their
the
mexicans
their
and
the
tamalese
their
and
the
christians
at
a
later
period
their
jesus
christ
may
properly
be
termed
the
of
orthodox
christians
as
he
stands
in
the
same
relation
to
his
disciples
who
believe
in
the
atonement
as
the
goat
did
to
the
jews
and
performs
the
same
end
and
office
the
goat
and
the
other
animals
took
away
the
sin
of
the
nation
in
each
case
respectively
in
like
manner
jesus
christ
takes
away
the
sin
of
the
world
being
called
the
lamb
of
god
that
taketh
away
the
sin
of
the
world
john
i
and
more
than
two
thousand
years
ago
the
mexicans
sacrificed
a
lamb
as
an
atonement
which
they
called
the
lamb
of
god
the
same
title
scripturally
applied
to
jesus
christ
the
conception
in
each
case
is
then
the
same
that
of
the
atonement
for
sin
by
the
sacrifice
of
an
innocent
victim
the
above
citations
show
that
the
present
custom
of
orthodox
christendom
in
packing
their
sins
upon
the
back
of
a
god
is
just
the
same
substantially
as
that
of
various
heathen
nations
who
were
anciently
in
the
habit
of
packing
them
upon
the
backs
of
various
dumb
animals
if
some
of
our
christian
brethren
should
protest
against
our
speaking
of
the
church
idea
of
atonement
as
that
of
packing
their
sins
upon
the
back
of
a
god
we
will
here
prove
the
appropriateness
of
the
term
upon
the
authority
of
the
bible
peter
expressly
declares
christ
bore
our
sins
upon
his
own
body
on
a
tree
see
peter
ii
just
as
the
jews
declared
the
bore
sins
on
his
body
and
the
ancient
brahmins
taught
that
the
bulls
and
the
heifers
bore
theirs
away
which
shows
that
the
whole
conception
is
of
purely
heathen
origin
and
hereafter
when
they
laugh
at
the
jewish
superstition
of
a
let
them
bear
in
mind
that
more
sensible
and
intelligent
people
may
laugh
in
turn
at
their
superstitious
doctrine
of
a
these
superstitious
customs
were
simply
expedients
of
different
nations
to
evade
the
punishment
of
their
sins
an
attempt
to
shift
their
retributive
consequences
on
to
other
beings
the
divine
atonement
more
especially
possessed
this
character
this
system
teaches
that
the
son
of
god
and
savior
of
the
world
was
sent
down
and
incarnated
in
order
to
die
for
the
people
and
thus
suffer
by
proxy
the
punishment
meted
out
by
divine
wrath
for
the
sins
of
the
whole
world
the
blood
of
a
god
must
atone
for
the
sins
of
the
whole
human
family
as
rams
goats
bullocks
and
other
animals
had
atoned
for
the
sins
of
families
and
nations
under
older
systems
thus
taught
brahminism
budhism
persianism
and
other
religious
systems
before
the
dawn
of
christianity
the
nucleus
of
the
atoning
system
is
founded
in
the
doctrine
without
the
shedding
of
blood
there
is
no
remission
for
sin
rom
a
monstrous
and
morally
revolting
doctrine
a
doctrine
which
teaches
us
that
blood
must
be
shed
somebody
veins
and
arteries
depleted
for
every
trivial
offense
committed
against
the
moral
law
somebody
must
pay
the
penalty
in
blood
somebody
must
be
slaughtered
for
every
little
foible
or
peccadillo
or
moral
blunder
into
which
erring
man
may
chance
to
stumble
while
upon
the
pilgrimage
of
life
while
journeying
through
the
wilderness
of
time
even
if
a
god
has
to
be
dragged
from
his
throne
in
heaven
and
murdered
to
accomplish
it
nothing
less
will
mitigate
the
divine
wrath
whose
soul
possessing
the
slightest
moral
sensibility
does
not
inwardly
and
instinctively
revolt
at
such
a
doctrine
we
would
not
teach
it
to
the
world
for
it
is
founded
in
butchery
and
bloodshed
and
is
an
old
pagan
superstition
which
originated
far
back
in
the
midnight
of
mental
darkness
and
heathen
ignorance
when
the
whole
human
race
were
under
the
lawless
sway
of
their
brutal
propensities
and
when
the
ennobling
attributes
of
love
mercy
and
forgiveness
had
as
yet
found
no
place
no
abiding
home
in
the
human
bosom
the
bloody
soul
of
the
savage
first
gave
it
birth
we
hold
the
doctrine
to
be
a
a
insult
to
the
father
who
we
are
told
is
in
mercy
and
plentiful
in
forgiveness
to
charge
with
sanctioning
such
a
doctrine
much
less
with
originating
it
there
is
no
mercy
or
forgiveness
in
putting
an
innocent
being
to
death
for
any
pretext
whatever
and
for
the
father
to
consent
to
the
brutal
assassination
of
his
own
innocent
son
upon
the
cross
to
gratify
an
implacable
revenge
toward
his
own
children
the
workmanship
of
his
own
hands
rather
than
forgive
a
moral
weakness
implanted
in
their
natures
by
a
voluntary
act
of
his
own
and
for
which
consequently
he
alone
ought
to
be
responsible
would
be
nothing
short
of
murder
in
the
first
degree
we
cherish
no
such
conception
we
can
not
for
a
moment
harbor
a
blasphemous
doctrine
which
represents
the
universal
father
as
being
a
and
murderous
being
instead
of
a
being
of
infinite
love
infinite
wisdom
and
infinite
in
all
the
moral
virtues
such
a
character
would
be
a
stigma
upon
any
human
being
and
no
person
actuated
by
a
strict
sense
of
justice
would
accept
salvation
upon
any
such
terms
as
that
prescribed
by
the
christian
atonement
it
is
manifestly
too
unjust
too
devoid
of
moral
principle
besides
being
a
flagrant
violation
of
the
first
principles
of
civil
and
criminal
jurisprudence
it
is
a
double
wrong
to
punish
the
innocent
for
the
guilty
it
is
the
infliction
of
injustice
on
the
one
hand
and
the
omission
of
justice
on
the
other
it
inflicts
the
highest
penalty
of
the
law
upon
an
innocent
being
whom
that
law
ought
to
shield
from
punishment
while
it
exculpates
and
liberates
the
guilty
party
whose
punishment
the
moral
law
demands
it
robs
society
of
a
useful
man
on
the
one
hand
and
turns
a
moral
pest
upon
community
on
the
other
thus
committing
a
twofold
wrong
or
act
of
injustice
no
court
in
any
civilized
country
would
be
allowed
to
act
upon
such
a
principle
and
the
judge
who
should
indorse
it
or
favor
a
law
or
principle
which
punishes
the
innocent
for
the
guilty
would
be
ruled
off
the
bench
at
once
here
however
we
are
sometimes
met
with
the
plea
that
the
offering
of
jesus
christ
was
a
voluntary
act
that
it
was
made
with
his
own
free
will
but
the
plea
do
do
away
with
either
the
injustice
or
criminality
of
the
act
no
innocent
person
has
a
right
to
suffer
for
the
guilty
and
the
courts
have
no
right
to
accept
the
offer
or
admit
the
substitute
an
illustration
will
show
this
if
jefferson
davis
had
been
convicted
of
the
crime
of
treason
and
sentenced
to
be
hung
and
abraham
lincoln
had
come
forward
and
offered
to
be
stretched
upon
the
gallows
in
his
place
is
there
a
court
in
the
civilized
world
which
would
have
accepted
the
substitute
and
hung
lincoln
and
liberated
davis
to
ask
the
question
is
but
to
answer
it
it
is
an
insult
to
reason
law
and
justice
to
entertain
the
proposition
the
doctrine
of
the
atonement
also
involves
the
infinite
absurdity
of
god
punishing
himself
to
appease
his
own
wrath
for
if
the
fullness
of
the
godhead
dwelt
in
christ
bodily
as
taught
in
ii
then
his
death
was
the
death
of
god
that
is
a
divine
suicide
prompted
and
committed
by
a
feeling
of
anger
and
revenge
which
terminated
the
life
of
the
infinite
ruler
a
doctrine
utterly
devoid
of
reason
science
or
sense
we
are
sometimes
told
man
owes
a
debt
to
his
maker
and
the
atonement
pays
that
debt
to
be
sure
and
to
whom
is
the
debt
owing
and
who
pays
it
why
the
debt
is
owing
to
god
and
god
in
the
person
of
jesus
christ
pays
it
pays
it
to
himself
we
will
illustrate
a
man
approaches
his
neighbor
and
says
sir
i
owe
you
a
thousand
dollars
but
can
never
pay
it
very
well
it
makes
no
difference
replies
the
claimant
i
will
pay
it
myself
and
forthwith
thrusts
his
hand
into
his
right
pocket
and
extracts
the
money
transfers
it
to
the
left
pocket
and
exclaims
there
the
debt
is
paid
a
curious
way
of
paying
debts
and
one
utterly
devoid
of
sense
and
yet
the
orthodox
world
have
adopted
it
for
their
god
we
find
however
that
they
carefully
avoid
practicing
this
principle
themselves
in
their
dealings
with
each
other
when
they
have
a
claim
against
a
neighbor
we
do
not
find
them
ever
thrusting
their
hands
into
their
own
pockets
to
pay
it
off
but
sue
him
and
compel
him
to
pay
if
he
refuses
to
do
it
without
compulsion
thus
proving
they
do
not
consider
it
a
correct
principle
of
trade
but
we
find
upon
further
investigation
that
the
assumed
debt
is
not
paid
after
all
when
a
debt
is
paid
it
is
canceled
and
dismissed
from
memory
and
nothing
more
said
about
it
but
in
this
case
the
sinner
is
told
he
must
still
suffer
the
penalty
for
every
sin
he
commits
notwithstanding
christ
died
to
atone
for
and
cancel
that
sin
where
then
is
the
virtue
of
the
atonement
like
other
doctrines
of
the
orthodox
creed
it
is
at
war
with
reason
and
common
sense
and
every
principle
of
sound
morality
and
will
be
marked
by
coming
ages
as
a
relic
of
barbarism

the
holy
ghost
of
oriental
origin
of
all
the
weird
fanciful
and
fabulous
stories
appertaining
to
the
gods
and
other
spiritual
entities
of
the
olden
times
whose
capricious
adventures
we
find
so
profusely
narrated
in
oriental
mythology
of
all
the
strange
mythical
and
mystical
feats
and
and
changes
in
the
shape
appearance
sex
and
modes
of
manifestation
which
characterize
the
hobgoblins

ghostly
beings
which
comprise
the
esoteric
stock
of
the
ancient
mysteries
that
appertaining
to
the
third
member
of
the
hypostatic
union
the
holy
ghost
seems
to
stand
and
i
propose
here
to
submit
the
facts
to
show
that
the
holy
ghost
story
of
the
christian
gospels
like
the
more
ancient
pagan
versions
of
the
same
story
is
marked
by
the
same
wild
discordant
and
legendary
characteristics
which
abound
in
all
the
accounts
of
gods
and
ghosts
found
recorded
in
the
religious
books
of
various
nations
the
following
brief
exposition
of
the
history
and
exploits
of
this
anomalous
nondescript
being
will
clearly
evince
that
the
same
fanciful
metaphorical
and
fabulous
changes
in
the
size
shape
sex
and
appearance
of
this
third
limb
of
the
triune
god
are
found
in
the
christian
scriptures
which
are
disclosed
in
the
more
ancient
oriental

we
will
first
exhibit
a
classification
of
the
names
and
characteristics
of
this
imaginary
being
drawn
from
the
gospels
and
epistles
of
the
christian
bible
by
which
it
will
be
observed
that
scarcely
any

the

in

jesus
christ
that
many
of
these
fabulous
conceptions
were
drawn
from
mythological
sources
will
be
made
manifest
by
the
following
facts
of
history
holy
ghost
in
the
shape
of
a
bird
a
dove
or
a
this
is
proven
to
be
a
very
ancient
pagan
tradition
as
it
is
found
incorporated
in
several
of
the
oriental
religious
systems
in
ancient
india
whose
prolific
spiritual
fancies
constitute
the
primary
parentage
of
nearly
all
the
doctrines
dogmas
and
superstitions
found
incorporated
in
the
christian
scriptures
a
dove
was
uniformly
the
emblem
of
the
holy
spirit
or
spirit
of
god
confirmatory
of
this
statement
we
find
the
declaration
in
the
anacalypsis
that
a
dove
stood
for
or
represented
a
third
member
of
the
trinity
and
was
the
regenerator
or
regeneratory
power
this
meets
the
christian
idea
of
regeneration
and
renewing
of
the
holy
ghost
titus
iii
a
person
being
baptized
under
the
brahminical
theocracy
was
said
to
be
regenerated
and
born
again
or
as
the
writer
expresses
it
they
were
born
into
the
spirit
or
the
spirit
into
them
that
is
the
dove
into
or
upon
them
as
vide
the
case
of
the
christian
holy
ghost
descending
in
bodily
shape
like
a
dove
and
alighting
on
christ
head
at
baptism
as
related
in
luke
iii
in
ancient
rome
a
dove
or
pigeon
was
the
emblem
of
the
female
procreative
energy
and
frequently
a
legendary
spirit
the
accompaniment
of
venus
and
hence
as
a
writer
remarks
it
is
very
appropriately
represented
as
descending
at
baptism
in
the
character
of
the
third
member
of
the
trinity
the
same
writer
tells
us
the
dove
fills
the
grecian
oracles
with
their
spirit
and
power
we
find
the
dove
also
in
the
romantic
eclogues
of
ancient
syria
in
the
syrian
temple
of
hierapolis
semiramis
is
represented
with
a
dove
on
her
head
thus
constituting
the
prototype
of
the
dove
on
the
head
of
the
christian
messiah
at
baptism
and
a
dove
was
in
more
than
one
of
the
ancient
religious
systems
the
spirit
of
god
holy
ghost
moving
on
the
face
of
the
waters
at
creation
as
implied
in
i
though
a
pigeon
was
often
indiscriminately
substituted
in
howe
ancient
mysteries
it
is
related
that
in
paul
cathedral
at
the
feast
of
whitsuntide
the
descent
of
the
holy
ghost
was
performed
by
a
white
pigeon
being
let
fly
out
of
a
hole
in
the
midst
of
the
roof
of
the
great
aisle
the
dove
and
the
pigeon
being
but
slight
variations
of
the
same
species
of
the
feathered
tribe
were
used
indiscriminately
as
evinced
above
the
holy
ghost
was
the
third
member
of
the
trinity
in
several
of
the
oriental
systems
father
son
and
holy
ghost
or
father
word
and
holy
ghost
john
are
familiar
christian
terms
to
express
the
divine
triad
which
shows
the
holy
ghost
to
be
the
acknowledged
third
member
of
the
christian
trinity
and
as
already
suggested
the
same
is
true
of
the
more
ancient
systems
the
holy
spirit
and
the
evil
spirit
were
each
in
their
turn
says
higgins
third
member
of
the
trinity
we
might
if
space
would
allow
draw
largely
upon
the
ancient
defunct
systems
in
proof
of
this
statement
in
these
triads
says
hillell
the
third
member
as
might
be
supposed
was
not
of
equal
rank
with
the
other
two
and
hence
in
the
theban
trinity
khonso
was
inferior
to
arion
and
mant
in
the
hindoo
triad
siva
was
subordinate
to
brahma
and
vishnu
and
a
score
of
similar
examples
might
be
adduced
from
the
trinities
of
other
and
older
oriental
religious
systems
but
for
the
inflexible
rule
of
brevity
which
forbids
their
presentation
here
with
all
of
which
the
more
modern
holy
ghost
conception
of
the
christian
world
is
an
exact
correspondence
as
this
imaginary
fabulous
being
is
less
conspicuous
than
and
has
always
stood
third
in
rank
with
the
father
and
second
to
the
son
alias
the
word
and
is
now
seldom
addressed
in
practical
christian
devotion
and
thus
the
analogy
is
complete
maurice
says
this
notion
of
a
third
person
in
the
deity
the
holy
ghost
was
diffused
among
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
see
ind
antiq
vol
iv
and
worseley
in
his
voyage
vol
avers
this
doctrine
to
be
of
very
great
antiquity
and
generally
received
by
all
the
gothic
and
celtic
nations
the
holy
ghost
was
the
holy
breath
which
in
the
hindoo
traditions
moved
on
the
face
of
the
waters
at
creation
and
imparted
life
and
vitality
into
everything
created
a
similar
conception
is
recognized
in
the
christian
scriptures
in
psalms
xxxiii
we
read
by
the
word
of
the
lord
were
the
heavens
made
and
all
the
host
of
them
by
the
breath
of
his
mouth
here
is
the
brahminical
conception
square
out
of
the
act
of
creation
by
the
divine
breath
which
is
the
holy
ghost
the
same
also
which
was
breathed
into
adam
by
which
he
became
a
living
soul
dubois
observes
the
prana
or
principle
of
life
of
the
hindoos
is
the
breath
of
life
by
which
the
creator
brahma
animates
the
clay
and
man
became
a
living
soul
page
holy
ghost
holy
breath
and
holy
wind
appear
to
have
been
synonymous
and
convertible
terms
for
the
living
vocal
emanations
from
the
mouth
of
the
supreme
god
as
memorialized
in
several
of
the
pagan
traditions
the
last
term
holy
wind
is
suggested
by
the
mighty
rushing
wind
from
heaven
which
filled
the
house
or
church
on
the
day
of
pentecost
see
acts
ii
several
of
the
old
religious
systems
recognize
the
holy
wind
as
a
term
for
the
holy
ghost
the
doxology
reported
by
a
missionary
in
the
religious
service
of
the
syrian
worship
runs
thus
praise
to
the
holy
spiritual
wind
which
is
the
holy
ghost
praise
to
the
three
persons
which
are
one
true
god
some
writers
maintain
that
the
hebrew
translated
spirit
of
god
i
in
our
version
should
read
wind
of
the
gods
and
we
find
that
the
word
of
our
greek
new
testament
is
sometimes
translated
ghost
and
sometimes
wind
as
best
suited
the
fancy
of
the
translators
in
john
iii
we
find
the
word
spirit
and
in
verse
eight
both
wind
and
spirit
are
found
and
in
luke
i
we
observe
the
term
holy
ghost
all
translated
from
the
same
word
let
it
be
specially
noted
that
in
the
greek
testament
the
word
is
used
in
all
these
cases
thus
proving
that
spirit
holy
ghost
and
wind
are
used
in
the
christian
scriptures
as
synonymous
terms
and
proving
also
that
an
unwarranted
license
has
been
assumed
by
translators
in
rendering
the
same
word
three
different
ways
auvaroff
in
his
essays
on
the
eleusinian
mysteries
speaks
of
the
torch
being
ignited
at
the
command
of
hermes
of
egypt
the
spiritual
agent
in
the
workshop
of
creation
relative
to
which
statement
a
writer
remarks
hermes
appears
in
this
instance
as
a
personification
of
wind
or
spirit
as
in
the
bible
meaning
the
christian
bible
god
wind
and
spirit
are
often
interchangeable
terms
and
the
word
appears
to
be
from
the
same
windy
source
holy
ghost
as
a
tongue
of
fire
which

even
this

higgins
tells
us
that
budha
an
incarnate
god
of
the
hindoos
three
thousand
years
ago
is
often
seen
with
a
glory
or
tongue
of
fire
upon
his
head
and
the
tradition
of
the
visible
manifestation
of
the
holy
ghost
by
fire
was
prevalent
among
the
ancient
budhists
celts
druids
and
etrurians
in
fact
as
our
author
truly
remarks
the
holy
ghost
or
holy
spirit
when
visible
was
always
in
the
form
of
fire
or
a
bird
and
was
always
accompanied
with
wisdom
and
power
hence
is
disclosed
the
origin
of
the
ancient
custom
amongst
the
hindoos
persians
and
chaldeans
of
making
offerings
to
the
solar
fire

in

manner
as
we
are
informed
by

the
ancient

were
not

moved
by
the

in

several
times
alludes
to
the
fact
and
exhibits
the
proof
that
the
doctrine
of
the
holy

was
known
to
this
ancient
people

by
the
laying
on
of

by

the
candidate

this
rite
too
is
traceable
to
a
very
ancient
period
and
was
practiced
by
several
of
the
old
symbolical
and
mythological
systems
the

the

was
with

while
baptism
into
the
third
member

the

consisted
of
the
initiatory
spiritual

application
of

it
appears
from
herbert
travels
that
in
ancient
countries
the

taken
to
the

who
named
him
christened
him
before
the
sacred
fire
after
which
ceremony
he
was
sprinkled

a
vessel

sacred

as

sometimes
says
higgins
relative
to
this
custom
among
the
ancient
heathen
the
priest
blew
his
breath
upon
the
child
which
was
then
considered
baptized
by
spiritus

or
ghost
baptism
by
the

in
case
of
baptism
a
portion
of
the
holy
ghost
was
supposed
to
be
transferred
from
the
priest
to
the
candidate
the
practice
of
breathing
in
or
upon
says
our
author
was
quite
common
among
the
ancient
heathen
holy

as
the
agent
in
divine
conception
or
the
procreation
of

jesus
is
said
to
have
been
conceived
by
the

and
we
find
similar
claims
instituted
still
more
anciently
for
other
incarnate
demigods

point
thus
we
observe
that
the
various
heterogeneous
conceptions
discordant
traditions
and
contradictory
superstitions
appertaining
to
that
anomalous
nondescript
being
known
as
the
holy
ghost
are
traceable
to
various
oriental
countries
and
to
a
very
remote
antiquity
we
will
only
occupy
space
with
one
or
two
more
historical
citations
of
a
general
nature
tending
to
prove
the
prevalence
of
this
ghostly
myth
in
other
countries
not
yet
cited
tell

o
thou
strong
in

ejaculated
sesostris
of
egypt
to
the
oracle
as
reported
by
manetho
who
before
me
could
subjugate
all
things
and
who
shall
after
me
but
the
oracle
rebuked
him
saying
first
god
then
the
word
and
with
them
the
spirit
see
nimrod
vol
p
and
plutarch
in
his
of
numa
says
our
author
shows
that
the
incarnation
of
the
holy
spirit
was
known
both
to
the
ancient
romans
and
egyptians
the
doctrine
is
thus
shown
to
have
been
nearly
universal
origin
of
the
holy
ghost
superstition
the
origin
of
the
tradition
respecting
this
fabulous
and
mythical
being
is
easily
traced
to
the
ancient
brahminical
trifold
conception
of
the
deity
in
which
stands
in
trinity
order
first
the
god
of
power
or
might
brahma
or
brahm
the
father
second
the
god
of
creation
the
word
answering
to
john
creative
word
see
john
i
and
third
the
god
of
generation
and
regeneration
the
holy
spirit
or
holy
ghost
the
last
member
of
the
triune
conception
of
the
deity
was
considered
under
the
brahminical
theocracy
the
vital
active
in
both
the
first
and
second
births
of
men
and
the
gods
it
will
be
borne
in
mind
by
the
reader
that
the
holy
ghost
is
represented
in
the
christian
scripture
as
being
the
active
generating
agent
of
christ
conception
he
being
as
matthew
declares
conceived
by
the
holy
ghost
the
holy
ghost
was
also
the
regenerating
agent
at
his
baptism
although
the
specific
object
of
the
descent
of
the
holy
ghost
on
that
occasion
is
not
stated
by
luke
who
relates
it
although
it
is
not
stated
for
what
purpose
the
holy
spirit
after
assuming
the
form
of
a
bird
alighted
and
sat
upon
his
head
yet
the
motive
is
fully
disclosed
in
the
older
mythical
religions
where
we
find
the
matter
in
fuller
detail
baptism
itself
is
claimed
by
all
its
christian
votaries
as
regenerating
or
imparting
a
new
spiritual
life
and
this
new
spiritual
life
was
believed
by
several
nations
as
before
stated
to
make
its
appearance
in
the
character
and
shape
of
a
bird
sometimes
a
pigeon
sometimes
a
dove
and
thus
the
origin
of
this
tradition
is
most
clearly
and
unmistakably
exposed
as
the
foregoing
historical
exposition
exhibits
the
holy
ghost
as
performing
several
distinct
and
discordant
offices
so
we
likewise
find
it
possessing
at
least
two
distinct
genders
the
masculine
and
neuter
no
gender
changing
from
one
to
the
other
as
occasion
seemed
to
require
from
all
these
metamorphoses
it
is
shown
and
demonstrated
that
the
sexual
and
other
changes
of
this
mysterious
being
equal
many
of
the
demigods
of
mythology
the
primary
windy
conception
of
the
holy
ghost
is
traceable
to
that
early
period
of
society
when
the
rude
and
untutored
denizens
of
the
earth
in
their
profound
ignorance
of
natural
causes
were
very
easily
and
naturally
led
into
the
belief
that
wherever
there
was
motion
there
was
a
god
or
the
active
manifestation
of
a
god
whether
it
was
in
the
wind
breath
water
fire
or
the
sun
hence
the
buddhists
had
their
god
who
manifested
himself
variously
in
the
shape
or
character
of
fire
wind
storms
gas
ghosts
gusts
and
the
breath
thus
constituting
a
very
counterpart
to
the
christian
holy
ghost
which
parkhurst
tells
us
originally
meant
air
in
motion
this
god
was
believed
to
have
sprung
from
the
supreme
primordial
god
which
the
ancient
brahmins
and
buddhists
generally
believed
was
constituted
of
a
fine
spiritual
substance
aura
anima
wind
ether
igneous
fluid
or
electrical
fire
fire
from
the
sun
giving
rise
to
baptism
by
fire
and
hence
the
third
god
or
third
member
of
the
trinity
subsequently
arising
out
of
this
compound
being
was
also
necessarily
composed
of
or
consisted
of
the
same
properties
all
of
which
were
believed
to
be
correlated
if
not
identical
such
is
a
complete
though
brief
historical
elucidation
of
that
mysterious
imaginary
being
so
corporally
intangible
that
faustus
of
the
third
century
declared
respecting
it
the
holy
spirit
the
third
majesty
has
the
air
for
his
residence
and
it
is
a
fabulous
god
whose
scriptural
biography
is
invested
with
so
many
ludicrous
and
abstruse
incidents
as
to
incite
several
hundred
christian
writers
to
labor
hard
with
a
godly
zeal
by
a
reconstruction
of
god
word
and
a
rehabiliment
of
the
ghostly
texts
to
effect
some
kind
of
a
reconciliation
of
the
story
with
reason
and
common
sense
with
what
success
the
reader
is
left
to
judge
the
unpardonable
sin
against
the
holy
ghost
before
dismissing
our
ghostly
narrative
it
may
effect
something
in
the
way
of
mitigating
the
anxious
fears
of
some
of
our
christian
brothers
and
sisters
to
explain
the
nature
of
the
sin
against
the
holy
ghost
and
assign
the
reason
for
its
being
unpardonable
the
sin
against
the
holy
ghost
consisted
according
to
the
ancient
mexican
traditions
in
resisting
its
operations
in
the
second
birth
that
is
the
regeneration
of
the
heart
or
soul
by
the
holy
ghost
and
as
the
rectification
of
the
heart
or
soul
was
a
prominent
idea
with
christ
there
is
scarcely
any
ground
to
doubt
but
that
this
was
the
notion
he
cherished
of
the
nature
of
the
sin
against
the
holy
ghost
and
it
was
considered
unpardonable
simply
because
as
the
pardoning
and
cleansing
process
consisted
in
or
was
at
least
always
accompanied
with
baptism
by
water
in
which
operation
the
holy
ghost
was
the
agent
in
effecting
a
new
birth
therefore
when
the
ministrations
or
operations
of
this
indispensable
agent
were
resisted
or
rejected
there
was
no
channel
no
means
no
possible
mode
left
for
the
sinner
to
find
a
renewed
acceptance
with
god
when
a
person
sinned
against
the
father
or
the
word
the
son
he
could
find
a
door
of
forgiveness
through
the
baptizing
processes
spiritual
or
elementary
of
the
holy
ghost
but
an
offense
committed
against
this
third
limb
of
the
godhead
had
the
effect
to
close
and
bar
the
door
so
that
there
could
be
no
forgiveness
either
in
this
life
or
that
which
is
to
come
to
sin
against
the
holy
ghost
was
to
tear
down
the
scaffold
by
which
the
door
of
heaven
was
to
be
reached
and
thus
it
is
explained
the
great
of
the
unpardonable
sin
against
the
holy
ghost
which
on
account
of
the
frightful
penalty
annexed
to
it
while
it
is
impossible
to
learn
what
it
consists
in
it
being
undefined
and
undefinable
has
caused
thousands
and
probably
millions
of
the
disciples
of
the
christian
faith
the
most
agonizing
hours
of
alarm
and
despair

the

the

john
i
i
the
doctrine
of
the
divine
creative
word
from
the
greek
logos
appears
to
have
been
coeval
in
its
origin
with
that
of
the
trinity
if
not
inseparably
connected
with
it
as
it
constitutes
the
second
member
of
the
trinity
of
father
word
and
holy
ghost
in
most
of
the
ancient
systems
of
religion
works
on
heathen
mythology
show
that
it
was
anciently
a
very
prevalent
custom
to
personify
ideas
thoughts
and
words
into
angels
and
gods
words
were
first
personated
and
transformed
into
men
then
into
angels
and
finally
into
gods
and
here
is
foreshadowed
the
origin
of
john
personification
of
the
word
made
flesh
it
was
simply
the
word
of
the
supreme
god
as
it
escaped
from
his
mouth
assuming
the
form
and
characteristics
of
a
divine
being
like
himself
and
taking
position
as
a
secondary
god
and
second
member
of
the
trinity
this
was
the
orient
conception
and
it
appears
to
have
been
john
he
evidently
had
no
thought
of
christ
experiencing
human
birth
at
first
or
being
born
of
a
woman
but
believed
like
some
of
the
orientalists
that
he
came
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
father
and
was
thus
made
flesh
john
i
not
a
word
of
christ
being
born
is
found
in
john
gospel
till
after
his
existence
as
the
word
is
spoken
of
see
first
note
in
back
of
book
the
word
as
creator
john
also
represents
the
word
as
having
been
the
creator
all
things
were
made
by
him
john
i
and
peter
declares
by
the
word
of
god
the
heavens
were
of
old
iii
now
let
it
be
observed
here
as
a
notable
circumstance
that
the
chinese
bible
much
older
than
the
christian
new
testament
likewise
declares
god
pronounced
the
primeval
word
and
his
own
eternal
and
glorious
abode
sprang
into
existence
guizot
in
a
note
on
gibbon
work
says
according
to
the
the
persian
bible
more
than
three
thousand
years
old
it
is
by
the
word
more
ancient
than
the
world
that
ormuzd
created
the
universe
in
like
manner
the
sacred
writings
of
the
ancient
thibetans
speak
of
the
word
which
produced
the
world
an
exact
counterpart
to
declaration
all
things
were
made
by
him
and
the
ancient
greek
writer
amelias
speaking
of
the
god
mercury
says
and
this
plainly
was
the
logos
the
word
by
whom
all
things
were
made
he
being
himself
eternal
as
heraclitus
would
say
he
assumed
to
be
with
god
and
to
be
god
and
in
him
everything
that
was
made
has
its
life
and
being
who
descending
into
body
and
putting
on
flesh
took
the
appearance
of
a
man
though
still
retaining
the
majesty
of
his
nature
here
is
the
word
made
flesh
set
forth
in
most
explicit
terms
the
psalmist
exclaims
by
the
word
of
god
were
the
heavens
made
and
all
the
host
of
them
by
the
breath
of
his
mouth
ps
xxxiii
here
is
disclosed
not
only
the
conception
of
the
word
as
creator
but
also
the
word
and
the
breath
as
synonymous
terms
both
of
which
conceptions
oriental
history
amply
proves
to
be
of
heathen
derivation
it
was
anciently
believed
that
the
word
and
breath
of
god
were
the
same
and
possessed
a
vitalizing
power
which
as
they
issued
from
his
mouth
might
be
transformed
into
another
being
known
as
a
secondary
god
both
the
jews
and
the
christians
seem
to
have
inherited
this
belief
as
evinced
by
the
foregoing
quotations
from
their
bible
the
most
ancient
tradition
taught
that
the
word
emanated
from
the
mouth
of
the
principal
god
and
became
flesh
that
is
took
form
as
the
ancient
brahmins
expressed
it
for
the
special
purpose
of
serving
as
agent
in
the
work
of
creation
that
is
to
become
the
creator
of
the
external
universe
john
evidently
borrowed
this
idea
read
his
first
chapter
of
the
word
the
or
previous
existence
of
the
word
antecedent
to
the
date
of
its
metamorphosis
into
the
human
form
we
find
taught
in
several
of
the
ancient
systems
of
religion
as
well
as
the
more
modern
christian
system
several
texts
in
the
christian
new
testament
set
forth
the
doctrine
quite
explicitly
christ
as
the
divine
word
declared
before
abraham
was
i
am
and
that
he
had
an
existence
with
the
father
before
the
foundation
of
the
world
which
is
a
distinct
avowal
of
the
doctrine
of
but
oriental
history
proves
the
doctrine
is
much
older
than
christianity
the
hindoo
very
anciently
taught
that
the
word
had
existed
with
god
from
all
eternity
and
when
spoken
it
became
a
glorious
form
the
aggregate
embodiment
of
all
the
divine
ideas
and
performed
the
work
of
creation
and
of
chrishna
it
is
affirmed
that
while
upon
the
earth
he
existed
also
in
heaven
see
baghavat
gita
in
like
manner
it
is
declared
of
an
egyptian
god
that
though
he
was
born
into
the
world
he
existed
with
his
father
god
before
the
world
was
made
and
parallel
to
this
is
the
statement
of
the
chinese
bible
that
though
the
holy
word
will
be
born
upon
the
earth
yet
he
existed
before
anything
was
made
even
for
pythagoras
it
was
claimed
he
existed
in
heaven
before
he
was
born
upon
the
earth
higgins
in
summing
up
the
matter
declares
all
the
old
religions
believed
the
world
was
created
by
the
word
and
that
this
word
existed
before
creation
vol
ii
which
clearly
indicates
the
source
of
st
john
creative
word
the
dual
or
name
of
the
word
in
most
cases
the
living
divine
word
was
known
by
different
names
and
titles
prior
to
the
era
of
its
assuming
the
mortal
form
from
that
by
which
it
was
known
after
its
fleshly
investment
among
the
ancient
persians
the
name
for
the
divine
spiritual
word
was
honover
after
its
human
birth
it
was
called
mithra
the
mediator
the
hindoo
oriental
term
for
the
primeval
word
was
om
or
aum
after
assuming
its
most
important
incarnate
form
it
was
known
as
chrishna
the
chinese
holy
interior
word
was
and
its
principal
incarnation
was
or
the
japanese
also
proclaimed
their
belief
in
a
divine
word
before
the
christian
era
which
in
their
language
was
amina
they
taught
like
john
that
it
came
forth
from
the
mouth
of
the
supreme
god
brahm
to
perform
the
work
of
creation
after
which
it
was
known
as
sakia
and
that
popular
christian
writer
milman
informs
us
that
the
jewish
founders
of
christianity
believed
in
an
original
divine
word
which
they
call
memra
when
it
descended
to
the
earth
and
became
flesh
and
dwelt
amongst
us
john
i
according
to
the
evangelist
john
it
was
known
as
jesus
christ
milman
states
also
that
the
appellation
to
the
word
is
found
in
the
indian
hindoo
persian
the
platonic
and
the
alexandrian
systems
hist
of
book
chap
thus
the
question
is
settled
by
christian
testimony
that
the
various
conceptions
of
the
divine
word
are
of
heathen
origin
the
word
as
a
second
member
of
the
trinity
there
are
three
that
bear
record
in
heaven
the
father
the
word
and
the
holy
ghost
john
v
observe
the
word
is
the
second
person
in
the
trinity
and
this
was
its
post
in
the
brahman
hindoo
persian
and
other
systems
all
religions
says
a
writer
which
taught
the
existence
of
the
word
as
a
great
primeval
spirit
represent
him
as
secondary
to
the
supreme
vol
ii
p
the
hindoos
reverenced
it
next
to
brahm
higgins
cuts
the
matter
short
by
declaring
the
logos
or
word
was
the
second
person
of
the
trinity
in
all
the
ancient
systems
as
in
the
christian
system
which
again
indicates
its
heathen
origin
the
word
as
a
biblical
title
the
word
the
holy
word
the
divine
word
are
terms
now
frequently
applied
to
the
christian
bible
without
any
suspicion
of
their
heathen
origin
the
the
persian
bible
was
always
called
the
living
word
of
god
for
that
is
the
meaning
of
the
term
and
the
oldest
bible
in
the
world
is
the
vedas
and
it
means
both
word
and
wisdom
om
the
egyptian
holy
word
they
frequently
applied
both
to
their
incarnate
gods
and
to
their
sacred
writings
the
practice
of
calling
bibles
the
word
of
god
originated
from
the
belief
that
when
the
incarnate
word
left
the
earth
and
returned
to
heaven
he
infused
a
portion
of
his
living
spirits
into
the
divine
writings
which
contained
his
history
and
his
doctrines
and
which
he
himself
had
prompted
his
disciples
to
write
as
his
last
revelation
to
man
they
then
must
contain
a
portion
of
him
a
portion
of
the
holy
word
hence
both
were
called
the
holy
word
and
this
heathen
custom
christians
borrowed
origin
of
the
word
as
creator
the
motive
which
prompted
a
belief
in
the
creative
word
may
be
styled
a
theological
necessity
it
was
believed
that
the
principal
god
like
the
rulers
of
earth
was
too
aristocratic
to
labor
with
his
own
hands
hence
another
god
was
originated
to
perform
the
work
of
creation
and
called
the
word
the
origin
of
the
creative
word
is
still
further
indicated
by
blackwood
magazine
it
says
creation
became
impossible
to
a
being
already
infinite
and
was
a
derogation
to
a
being
already
perfect
some
lower
god
some
avatar
must
be
interposed
as
an
emanation
from
the
mouth
of
the
god
supreme
to
perform
the
subordinate
task
of
creation
hence
originated
and
came
forth
the
word
as
creator
chapter
xxiv
the
trinity
very
anciently
a
current
heathen
doctrine
there
are
three

the

and
the
holy

and
these
three
are
one
i
john

this
text
which
evidently
discloses
a
belief
in
the
existence
of
three
separate
and
distinct
beings
in
the
godhead
sets
forth
a
doctrine
which
was
anciently
of
almost
universal
prevalence
nearly
every
nation
whether
oriental
or
occidental
whose
religious
faith
has
been
commemorated
in
history
discloses
in
its
creed
a
belief
in
the
trifold
nature
and
triune
division
of
the
deity
jerome
testifies
unequivocally
all
the
ancient
nations
believed
in
the
trinity
and
a
volume
of
facts
and
figures
might
be
cited
here
if
we
had
space
for
them
in
proof
of
this
statement
a
text
from
one
of
the
hindoo
bibles
the
puranas
will
evince
the
antiquity
and
prevalence
of
this
belief
in
a
nation
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
millions
of
people
more
than
two
thousand
years
ago
o
you
three
lords
ejaculated

i
recognize
only
one

inform
me
therefore
which
of
you
is
the
true
divinity
that
i
may
address
to
him
alone
my
vows
and
adorations
the
three
gods
brahma
vishnu
and
siva
becoming
manifest

replied
learn
o
devotee
that
there
is
no
real
distinction
between
us
what
to
you
appears
such
is
only
by
semblance
the
single
being
appears
under
three
forms
by
the
acts
of
creation
preservation
and
destruction
but
he
is
one
now
reader
note
the
remark
here
that
the
ancient
christian
fathers
almost
universally
and
unanimously
proclaimed
the
doctrine
of
the
trinity
as
one
of
the
leading
tenets
of
the
christian
faith
and
as
a
doctrine
derived
directly
by
revelation
from
heaven
but
here
we
find
it
most
explicitly
set
forth
by
a
disciple
of
a
pagan
religion
more
than
three
thousand
years
ago
as
the
christian
missionary
allen
states
that
the
hindoo
bible
in
which
it
was
found
was
compiled
fourteen
hundred
years
before
christ
and
written
at
a
still
earlier
period
and
we
find
the
same
doctrine
very
explicitly
taught
in
the
ancient
brahmin
persian
chaldean
chinese
mexican
and
grecian
systems
all
much
older
than
christianity
no
writer
ever
taught
or
avowed
a
belief
in
any
tenet
of
religious
faith
more
fully
or
plainly
than
plato
sets
forth
the
doctrine
of
the
trinity
in
his
phaedon
written
four
hundred
years
and
his
terms
are
found
to
be
in
most
striking
conformity
to
the
christian
doctrine
on
this
subject
as
taught
in
the
new
testament
plato
first
term
for
the
trinity
was
in
greek
to
agathon
the
supreme
god
or
father
the
logos
which
is
the
greek
term
for
the
word
and
psyche
which
the
greek
lexicon
defines
to
mean
soul
spirit
or
ghost
of
course
the
holy
ghost
here
we
have
the
three
terms
of
the
christian
trinity
father
word
and
holy
ghost
as
plainly
taught
as
language
can
express
it
thus
making
plato
exposition
of
the
trinity
and
definition
of
its
terms
published
four
hundred
years
identical
in
meaning
with
those
of
john
as
found
in
his
gospel
and
contained
in
the
above
quoted
text
where
then
is
the
foundation
for
the
dogmatic
claim
on
the
part
of
the
christian
professors
for
the
divine
origin
of
the
trinity
doctrine
we
will
here
cite
the
testimony
of
some
christian
writers
to
prove
that
the
trinity
is
a
doctrine
a
powell
declares
i
not
only
confess
but
i
such
a
similitude
of
plato
and
john
trinity
doctrines
as
bespeaks
a
common
origin
thirteenth
letter
to
dr
priestley
what
is
that
you
say
bishop
a
common
origin
then
you
concede
both
are
or
both
if
the
former
then
revelation
and
heathenism
are
synonymous
terms
if
the
latter
then
christianity
stands
on
a
level
with
heathen
mythology
which
horn
of
the
dilemma
will
you
choose
augustine
confessed
he
found
the
beginning
of
john
gospel
in
phædon
which
is
a
concession
of
the
whole
ground
another
writer
chataubron
speaks
of
an
ancient
greek
inscription
on
the
great
obelisk
at
rome
which
reads
the
mighty
god
the
begotten
of
god
as
christ
is
declared
to
be
the
only
begotten
of
the
father
john
i
and
apollo
the
spirit
the
holy
spirit
or
holy
ghost
thus
presenting
in
plain
language
the
three
terms
of
the
trinity
and
cudworth
in
corroboration
of
this
report
says
the
greeks
had
a
first
god
and
second
god
and
third
god
and
the
second
was
begotten
by
the
first
and
yet
for
all
that
continues
cudworth
they
considered
all
these
one
in
the
platonic
or
grecian
trinity
the
first
person
was
considered
the
planner
of
the
work
of
creation
the
second
person
the
creator
and
the
third
person
the
ghost
or
spirit
which
moved
upon
the
face
of
the
waters
and
infused
life
into
the
mighty
deep
at
creation
the
same
holy
ghost
which
descended
from
heaven
to
infuse
life
into
the
waters
at
christ
baptism
thus
the
resemblance
is
complete
basnage
quotes
a
christian
writer
of
the
fifth
century
as
declaring
the
athenian
sage
plato
marvelously
anticipated
one
of
the
most
important
and
mysterious
doctrines
of
the
christian
religion
meaning
the
trinity
an
important
concession
truly
the
oldest
and
probably
the
original
form
of
the
trinity
is
that
found
in
the
brahmin
and
hindoo
systems
the
terms
of
which
are
brahma
the
father
or
supreme
god
vishnu
the
incarnate
word
and
creator
siva
the
spirit
of
god
the
holy
spirit
or
ghost
each
answering
to
corresponding
terms
of
the
christian
trinity
and
yet
two
thousand
years
older
according
to
smith
we
have
not
allowable
space
for
other
facts
and
citations
as
this
work
is
designed
as
a
mere
epitome
although
we
have
but
entered
upon
the
threshold
of
the
evidence
tending
to
prove
that
the
christian
trinity
was
born
of
heathen
parents
that
it
is
an
offspring
of
heathen
mythology
like
other
doctrines
of
the
christian
faith
claimed
by
its
disciples
as
the
gift
of
divine
revelation
here
let
it
be
noted
as
a
curious
chapter
in
sacred
history
that
the
numerous
divine
trinities
which
have
constituted
a
part
of
nearly
every
religious
system
ever
propagated
to
the
world
were
composed
in
every
case
of
male
gods
no
female
has
ever
yet
been
admitted
into
the
triad
of
gods
composing
the
orthodox
trinity
every
member
of
the
trinity
in
every
case
is
a
male
and
an
old
bachelor
a
doctrine
most
flagrantly
at
war
with
the
principles
of
modern
philosophy
for
this
science
teaches
us
that
the
endowment
of
a
being
with
either
male
or
female
organs
presupposes
the
existence
of
the
other
sex
and
that
either
sex
without
the
other
would
be
a
ludicrous
anomaly
and
a
ludicrous
distortion
of
nature
unparalleled
in
the
history
of
science
as
sexual
organs
create
an
imperious
desire
for
the
other
sex
no
male
or
female
could
long
enjoy
full
happiness
in
the
absence
of
the
other
party
what
an
unhappy
lonesome
place
therefore
the
orthodox
heaven
must
have
been
during
the
eternity
of
the
past
with
no
society
but
old
bachelors
the
trinity
was
constituted
of
males
simply
because
woman
has
always
been
considered
a
mere
cipher
in
society
a
mere
tool
for
convenience
an
appendage
to
his
wants
hence
instead
of
having
a
place
among
the
gods
she
led
the
practical
life
of
a
servant
and
a
menial
which
accounts
for
her
exclusion
from
the
trinity
but
the
time
is
coming
when
she
will
rule
both
heaven
and
earth
with
the
omnipotent
power
of
her
love
nature
then
we
shall
have
no
war
in
heaven
and
no
fighting
on
earth
chapter
xxv
absolution
and
the
confession
of
sins
of
heathen
origin
some
christian
writers
have
labored
to
make
it
appear
that
this
is
exclusively
a
christian
doctrine
while
others
have
labored
as
hard
to
get
it
out
of
their
bible
or
make
the
people
believe
that
it
is
not
therein
taught
we
shall
show
upon
scriptural
and
historical
authority
that
both
are
wrong
there
can
be
no
question
as
to
this
rite
having
existed
outside
of
christianity
or
of
its
being
much
older
than
christianity
history
proves
both
nor
can
it
be
successfully
denied
that
it
is
taught
in
the
christian
scriptures
both
the
confessing
of
sins
and
that
of
forgiving
sins
the
apostle
james
with
respect
to
the
former
is
quite
explicit
he
enjoins
emphatically
confess
your
faults
one
to
another
james
v
the
practice
of
forgiving
sins
is
also
enjoined
forgiving
one
another
is
recommended
both
in
ephesians
iv
and
colossians
iii
and
whatsoever
ye
shall
lose
on
earth
shall
be
loosed
in
heaven
matthew
xviii
is
interpreted
as
conferring
the
power
to
forgive
sins
and
then
we
remark
that
the
practices
both
of
confessing
and
forgiving
sins
are
very
ancient
pagan
rites
and
customs
speaking
of
their
prevalence
in
ancient
india
the
author
of
the
anacalypsis
remarks
the
person
offering
sacrifices
made
a
verbal
confession
of
his
sins
and
received
absolution
auricular
confession
was
also
practiced
among
the
ancient
mithriacs
or
persians
and
the
parsees
proper
of
the
same
country
volney
tells
us
they
observed
all
the
christian
sacraments
even
to
the
laying
on
of
hands
in
the
confirmation
and
the
christian
tertullian
also
tells
us
that
the
priests
of
mithra
promised
absolution
from
sin
on
confession
and
baptism
while
another
author
adds
that
on
such
occasions
mithra
marked
his
followers
the
servants
of
god
in
their
foreheads
and
that
he
celebrated
the
sacrifice
of
bread
which
is
the
resurrection
in
the
collection
of
the
jewish
laws
called
the
mishna
we
are
told
the
jews
confessed
their
sins
by
placing
their
hands
upon
a
calf
belonging
to
the
priest
and
that
this
was
called
the
confession
of
calves
see
mishna
tom
ii
p
confessing
sins
was
practiced
in
ancient
mexico
also
under
numa
of
rome
whose
priests
we
are
informed
had
to
clear
their
consciences
by
confessing
their
sins
before
they
could
offer
sacrifices
the
practice
of
confessing
and
forgiving
sins
as
recommended
in
the
christian
bible
and
practiced
by
some
of
the
christian
sects
has
been
the
source
of
much
practical
evil
by
furnishing
a
pretext
and
license
to
some
extent
for
the
commission
of
crime
and
sin
while
sins
can
be
so
easily
obliterated
they
will
be
committed
perpetrated
without
much
remorse
or
restraint
in
china
says
the
rev
pitrat
the
invocation
of
omito
is
sufficient
to
remit
the
punishment
of
the
greatest
crimes
the
same
author
tells
us
the
ancient
initiation
of
the
pagans
had
tribunals
of
penance
where
the
priests
under
the
name
of
heard
from
the
mouth
of
the
sinners
themselves
the
avowal
of
their
sins
of
which
their
souls
were
to
be
purified
and
from
the
punishment
of
which
they
wished
to
be
exempted
page
the
granting
of
absolution
for
sin
or
misconduct
among
the
early
primitive
christians
was
so
common
cyprian
informs
us
that
thousands
of
reprieves
were
granted
daily
which
served
as
an
indirect
license
to
crime
and
thus
the
doctrine
of
divine
forgiveness
as
taught
by
pagans
and
christians
has
proved
to
be
demoralizing
in
its
effects
upon
society

origin
of
baptism
by
water
fire
blood
and
the
holy
ghost
baptism
in
some
of
its
various
forms
is
a
very
ancient
rite
and
was
extensively
practiced
in
several
oriental
countries
it
was
administered
in
a
great
varieties
of
forms

with
the
use

water

ghost
were
also
used

ceremonies
we

brief
space
to
each
baptism
by
water
baptism
by
water
says
higgins
is
a
very
old
rite
being
practised
by
the
followers
of
zoroaster
by
the
romans
the
egyptians
and
other
nations
it
was
also
vogue
among
the
ancient
hindoos
at
a
still
earlier
day
their
mode
of
administering
it
was
to
dip
the
candidate
for
immersion
three
times
in
the
watery
element
in
the
same
manner
as
is
now
practiced
by
some
of
the
christian
sects
during
the
performance
of
which
the
hierophant
would
ejaculate
the
following
prayer
and
ceremony
o
lord
this
man
is
impure
like
the
mud
of
this
stream
but
as
thou
cleanse
and
deliver
his
soul
from
sin
as
the
water
cleanses
his
body
they
believed
that
water
possesses
the
virtue
of
purifying
both
soul
and
body
the
latter
from
filth
and
the
former
from
sin
the
ancient
mexican
persians
hindoos
and
jews
were
in
the
habit
of
baptizing
their
infants
soon
after
they
were
born
and
the
water
used
for
this
purpose
was
called
the
water
of
regeneration
paul
speaks
of
being
saved
by
the
washing
of
regeneration
see
titus
iii
those
who
touched
these
infants
before
they
were
baptized
were
deemed
impure
and
as
this
was
unavoidable
on
the
part
of
the
mothers
they
were
required
as
in
the
cases
of
the
mothers
of
chrishna
and
christ
to
present
themselves
on
the
eighth
day
after
accouchement
to
the
priest
in
the
temple
to
be
purified
the
romans
chose
the
eighth
day
for
girls
and
the
ninth
for
boys
the
child
was
usually
named
christened
at
the
time
it
was
baptized
and
in
india
the
name
or
god
name
or
some
other
mark
was
engraven
or
written
on
the
forehead
this
custom
is
several
times
recognized
in
the
christian
bible
both
in
the
old
and
in
the
new
testament
see
ezek
ix
rev
xiv
xix
etc
john
speaks
of
a
mark
being
made
on
the
forehead
see
rev
xiii
also
of
the
name
of
god
being
written
on

the
dove
descending
at
baptism
at
this
stage
of
our
inquiry
it
may
be
stated
that
several
of
the
ancient
religious
orders
had
the
legend
of
a
dove
or
pigeon
descending
at
baptism
a
counterpart
to
the
evangelical
story
of
the
spirit
of
god
descending
in
bodily
shape
like
a
dove
and
alighting
on
the
head
of
jesus
christ
while
being
baptized
by
john
in
jordan
see
luke
iii
it
will
be
observed
here
that
the
spirit
or
soul
of
god
descended
not
only
in
the
manner
but
in
bodily
shape
like
a
dove
this
accords
with
the
tradition
anciently
prevalent
among
the
hindoos
mexicans
greeks
romans
and
persians
or
babylonians
that
all
souls
or
spirits
possessed
or
were
capable
of
assuming
the
form
of
a
dove
hence
it
is
reported
of
polycarp
semiramis
caesar
and
others
that
at
death
their
souls
or
spirits
were
seen
to
leave
the
body
in
bodily
shape
like
a
dove
and
ascend
to
heaven
the
divine
love
or
eros
says
higgins
was
supposed
by
the
oriental
heathen
to
descend
often
in
the
form
of
a
dove
to
bless
the
candidate
for
baptism
these
traditions
doubtless
gave
rise
to
the
story
of
the
dove
descending
at
baptism
that
is
god
in
the
shape
of
a
dove
for
that
is
clearly
the
meaning
of
the
text
we
are
also
informed
by
our
author
just
quoted
that
a
dove
stood
for
and
represented
among
the
orientalists
the
third
person
of
the
trinity
as
it
does
in
the
gospel
story
of
christ
he
being
the
second
member
of
the
christian
trinity
of
father
son
and
holy
ghost
it
was
considered
the
regenerator
or
regenerating
spirit
and
persons
being
baptized
were
said
to
be
born
again
into
the
spirit
or
the
spirit
into
them
that
is
the
dove
into
or
upon
them
what
a
is
furnished
by
these
oriental
religions
for
solving
the
mysteries
of
the
christian
bible
how
much
more
lucid
than
divine
revelation
we
will
quote
again
from
higgins
among
all
nations
from
the
very
earliest
period
water
has
been
used
as
a
species
of
religious
sacrament
because
as
it
dripped
from
the
clouds
it
was
observed
to
have
the
power
of
reviving
drooping
nature
and
creating
anew
or
regenerating
the
whole
vegetable
kingdom
in
spring
it
was
hence
chosen
as
an
emblem
of
spiritual
regeneration
and
a
medium
of
baptism
water
was
the
element
by
means
of
which
everything
was
born
again
through
the
agency
of
the
eros
dove
or
divine
love
and
hence
the
ceremony
of
dipping
or
plunging
or
as
it
is
modernly
termed
baptizing
came
into
vogue
for
the
remission
of
sins
and
the
regeneration
into
a
new
and
more
holy
life
some
streams
were
supposed
to
have
more
efficacy
in
these
respects
than
others
hence
nearly
all
religious
nations
had
their
holy
rivers
holy
water
sacred
pools
etc
the
hindoos
resorted
to
the
holy
ganges
the
egyptians
to
the
holy
nile
the
chaldeans
and
persians
to
the
holy
euphrates
the
greeks
to
their
holy
lustral
water
the
italians
to
the
river
po
and
the
jews
and
christians
to
their
holy
river
jordan
if
jordan
was
not
called
holy
it
was
undoubtedly
considered
so
else
why
did
elisha
order
naaman
to
wash
seven
times
in
that
stream
instead
of
damascus
which
was
much
nearer
and
more
accessible
and
why
was
christ
baptized
in
jordan
and
all
the
land
of
judea
and
they
of
jerusalem
were
baptized
in
jordan
confessing
their
sins
matt
iii
vi
why
as
several
streams
were
handier
to
a
large
portion
of
the
candidates
simply
because
jordan
was
considered
to
be
more
holy
and
christians
had
their
sacred
pool
of
bethesda
as
the
hindoos
had
their
sahar
the
rite
of
baptism
was
at
first
generally
practiced
in
caves
as
were
also
other
religious
rites
and
as
these
caves
were
often
difficult
of
access
and
their
mouths
doors
or
gates
narrow
and
difficult
to
enter
they
fully
exemplify
christ
declaration
straight
is
the
gate
and
narrow
is
the
way
that
leadeth
unto
life
matt
vii
and
when
he
declared
except
a
man
be
born
of
water
and
of
the
spirit
he
can
not
enter
the
kingdom
of
heaven
john
iii
he
was
only
seconding
the
exhortation
of
the
priests
to
enter
these
subterranean
vaults
and
be
baptized
after
the
oriental
and
jewish
custom
thus
originated
baptism
by
water
in
the
form
of
dipping
or
immersion
baptism
by
sprinkling
owing
to
the
scarcity
of
water
in
some
countries
and
its
entire
absence
in
others
and
the
fatal
effects
sometimes
resulting
from
the
practice
of
baptizing
infants
and
invalids
by
immersion
a
new
mode
of
baptism
eventually
sprung
up
now
known
as
sprinkling
in
which
sometimes
water
and
sometimes
blood
was
used
virgil
ovid
and
cicero
all
speak
of
its
prevalence
amongst
the
ancient
romans
or
latins
we
are
informed
that
the
ancient
jews
practiced
it
upon
their
women
while
in
a
state
of
nudity
the
ceremony
being
administered
by
three
rabbis
or
priests
but
the
custom
finally
gave
way
to
one
more
consonant
with
decorum
blood
being
considered
the
life
thereof
of
man
was
deemed
more
efficacious
than
water
and
hence
was
often
used
in
lieu
of
that
element
the
greeks
kept
a
holy
vessel
for
this
purpose
known
as
the
facina
the
romans
used
a
brush
which
may
now
be
seen
engraven
upon
some
of
their
ancient
coins
and
sculptured
on
their
ancient
temples
the
hindoos
and
persians
used
a
branch
of
laurel
or
some
other
shrub
for
sprinkling
the
repentant
candidate
whether
water
or
blood
was
used
in
some
countries
the
rite
was
practiced
as
a
talisman
against
evil
spirits
the
mexicans
never
approached
their
altars
without
sprinkling
them
with
blood
drawn
from
their
own
bodies
as
the
jews
sprinkled
the
walls
and
of
their
temples
with
blood
under
the
requisition
of
the
levitical
code
this
mode
of
fancied
purification
by
sprinkling
either
with
water
or
blood
we
find
recognized
and
apparently
sanctioned
in
the
christian
bible
both
in
the
old
and
new
testaments
ezekiel
says
i
will
sprinkle
clean
water
on
you
ezek
xxxvi
peter
uses
the
phrase
the
sprinkling
of
the
blood
of
jesus
christ
peter
i
and
paul
makes
use
of
the
expression
the
blood
of
sprinkling
that
speaketh
better
things
than
that
of
abel
heb
xii
which
we
regard
as
an
indirect
sanction
of
the
senseless
heathen
idea
of
effecting
spiritual
purification
by
drops
of
blood
see
potter
antiquities
and
herbert
travels
baptism
by
fire
baptism
by
fire
was
a
form
or
mode
of
application
which
seems
to
have
been
introduced
from
the
belief
that
it
was
productive
of
a
higher
degree
of
purification
there
were
several
ways
of
using
fire
in
the
baptismal
rite
in
some
cases
the
candidate
for
immortality
ran
through
blazing
streams
of
fire
a
custom
which
was
called
the
baptism
of
fire
de
humboldt
in
his
views
of
the
cordilleras
and
monuments
of
america
informs
us
it
prevailed
in
india
chaldea
and
syria
and
throughout
eastern
asia
it
appears
to
have
been
gotten
up
as
a
substitute
for
as
this
luminary
was
believed
to
be
constituted
of
fire
though
in
reality
there
never
was
any
such
thing
as
sun
or
solar
worship
christian
writers
represent
the
ancient
persians
as
has
having
been
addicted
to
solar
worship
but
firdausi
cudworth
and
other
authors
declare
that
neither
they
nor
any
other
nation
ever
worshiped
the
sun
but
merely
an
imaginary
deity
supposed
to
reside
in
the
sun
heathen
nations
have
been
charged
with
many
things
of
which
they
were
not
guilty
though
it
is
true
that
in
the
spirit
of
exhortation
whosoever
loseth
his
life
for
my
sake
shall
find
it
some
of
the
candidates
for
the
fiery
ordeal
voluntarily
sacrificed
their
lives
in
the
operation
under
the
persuasion
that
it
was
necessary
to
purify
the
soul
and
would
enable
them
to
ascend
to
higher
posts
or
planes
of
enjoyment
in
the
celestial
world
and
some
of
them
were
taught
that
sins
not
expurgated
by
fire
or
some
other
efficaciously
renovating
process
in
this
life
would
be
punished
by
fire
in
the
life
to
come
here
we
will
mention
that
there
is
a
seeming
recognition
of
this
ancient
heathen
rite
in
both
departments
of
the
christian
bible
isaiah
says
when
thou
walkest
through
fire
thou
shalt
not
be
burned
lxiii
and
the
baptist
john
recognizes
three
modes
of
baptism
i
indeed
baptize
you
with
water
but
he
that
cometh
after
me
shall
baptize
you
with
fire
and
the
holy
ghost
matt
iii
and
paul
teaches
the
necessity
of
being
purified
by
fire
see
i
cor
iii
so
it
is
both
a
heathen
and
a
christian
idea
baptism
by
the
holy
ghost
this
fanciful
ceremony
is
both
a
christian
and
a
heathen
rite
and
is
undoubtedly
of
heathen
origin
the
mode
of
applying
it
was
to
breathe
into
or
upon
the
seeker
for
divine
favors
this
was
done
by
the
priest
who
it
was
believed
imparted
the
spirit
of
god
by
the
process
the
custom
herbert
informs
us
was
anciently
quite
common
in
oriental
countries
and
was
at
a
later
date
borrowed
by
christ
and
his
apostles
and
incorporated
into
the
christian
ceremonies
we
find
that
christ
not
only
sanctioned
it
but
practised
it
as
it
is
declared
when
he
met
his
disciples
after
his
resurrection
he
breathed
on
them
and
saith
unto
them
receive
ye
the
holy
ghost
john
xx
and
the
following
language
of
ezekiel
is
evidently
a
sanction
of
the
same
heathen
custom
thus
saith
the
lord
god
come
from
the
four
winds
o
breath
and
breathe
upon
these
slain
that
they
may
live
xxxvii
let
it
be
borne
in
mind
here
that
breath
air
wind
spirit
and
ghost
were
used
as
synonymous
terms
according
to
parkhurst
see
chap
xxii
and
this
breathing
was
supposed
to
impart
spiritual
life
being
nothing
less
than
the
spirit
of
god
the
same
as
that
breathed
into
adam
when
he
became
a
living
soul
see
ii
for
a
fuller
exposition
see
chapter
xxii
baptism
of
or
for
the
dead
it
was
customary
among
the
hindoos
and
other
nations
to
postpone
baptism
till
near
the
supposed
terminus
of
life
in
order
that
the
ablution
might
extinguish
all
the
sins
and
misdeeds
of
the
subject
earthly
probation
but
it
sometimes
happened
that
men
and
women
were
killed
or
died
unexpectedly
before
the
rite
was
administered
and
as
it
would
not
do
for
these
unfortunate
souls
to
be
deprived
of
the
benefit
of
this
ordinance
the
custom
was
devised
of
baptizing
the
defunct
body
or
more
commonly
some
living
person
in
its
stead
the
method
of
executing
the
latter
expedient
according
to
chrysostom
was
to
place
some
living
person
under
the
bed
or
couch
on
which
the
corpse
was
reclining
when
the
defunct
was
asked
if
he
would
be
baptized
the
living
man
responding
for
the
dead
answered
in
the
affirmative
the
corpse
was
then
taken
and
dipped
in
a
vessel
prepared
for
the
purpose
this
silly
practice
was
in
vogue
among
the
early
christians
and
paul
seems
to
regard
it
as
an
important
custom
else
what
shall
they
do
which
are
baptized
for
the
dead
if
the
dead
rise
not
at
all
i
cor
xv
the
inference
derivable
from
this
text
is
that
paul
held
that
the
labor
of
baptizing
the
dead
would
be
lost
in
the
event
of
the
falsification
of
the
doctrine
of
the
resurrection
but
otherwise
it
would
be
valid
which
evinces
his
faith
in
the
senseless
and
superstitious
practice
it
will
be
observed
from
the
historical
exposition
of
this
chapter
that
all
the
various
ancient
heathen
modes
and
rites
of
baptism
have
been
practiced
by
christians
and
are
sanctioned
by
their
bible
chapter
xxvii
the
sacrament
or
eucharist
of
heathen
origin
at
the
feast
of
the
passover
christ
is
represented
while
distributing
bread
to
his
disciples
to
have
said
take
eat
this
is
my
body
matt
xxvi
and
while
handing
round
the
consecrated
cup
he
enjoined
drink
ye
all
of
it
for
this
is
my
blood
of
the
new
covenant
which
is
shed
for
many
for
the
remission
of
sins
xxvi
here
is
a
very
clear
and
explicit
indorsement
of
what
is
generally
termed
the
eucharist
or
sacrament
and
nothing
can
be
more
susceptible
of
proof
than
that
this
rite
or
ordinance
is
of
pagan
origin
and
was
practically
recognized
many
centuries
prior
to
the
dawn
of
the
christian
era
so
we
observe
by
the
text
above
quoted
the
christian
savior
and
lawgiver
copied
or
reproduced
an
old
pagan
rite
as
a
part
of
his
professedly
new
and
spiritual
system
one
of
the
most
ancient
and
formulas
of
pagandom
and
stranger
still
the
catechisms
of
the
christian
church
represent
this
ordinance
as
having
originated
in
the
design
and
motive
to
keep
the
ancient
christian
world
in
remembrance
of
the
death
and
sufferings
and
sacrifice
of
christ
while
we
find
it
existing
long
prior
to
his
time
both
among
jews
and
pagans
this
being
virtually
admitted
in
the
bible
itself
so
far
as
respects
the
pagans
thus
proving
that
it
did
not
originate
with
christ
and
therefore
is
not
of
christian
origin
for
in
viv
we
read
and
melchisedek
king
of
salem
brought
forth
bread
and
wine
and
he
was
the
priest
of
the
most
high
god
because
the
melchisedek
here
spoken
of
is
represented
as
being
a
priest
of
the
most
high
god
and
showed
so
much
respect
to
abraham
it
is
presumed
and
assumed
by
christian
writers
that
he
was
a
jewish
priest
and
king
and
faber
vol
calls
him
an
incarnation
of
the
son
of
god
but
there
is
no
intimation
throughout
the
jewish
scriptures
of
the
jews
ever
having
had
a
king
or
priest
by
that
name
and
besides
eupolemus
vol
tells
us
that
the
temple
of
melchisedek
was
the
temple
of
jupiter
in
which
pythagoras
studied
philosophy
then
again
according
to
some
writers
the
name
is
synonymous
with
moloch
the
god
of
war
among
the
greeks
strange
then
that
melchisedek
should
be
claimed
as
a
priest
and
king
among
the
jews
be
this
as
it
may
the
case
proves
that
the
ceremony
of
offering
bread
and
wine
existed
long
before
the
era
of
jesus
christ
and
then
we
have
much
more
and
much
stronger
proof
of
this
fact
than
is
here
furnished
the
christian
faber
virtually
admits
it
when
he
tells
us
the
devil
led
the
heathen
to
anticipate
christ
with
respect
to
several
things
as
the
mysteries
of
the
eucharist
etc
and
this
very
solemnity
says
st
justin
the
evil
spirit
introduced
into
the
mysteries
of
mithra
reeves
justin
p
higgins
observes
it
was
instituted
hundreds
of
years
before
the
lord
death
took
place
amongst
the
ancient
religious
orders
and
nations
who
practiced
this
rite
we
may
name
the
essenes
persians
pythagoreans
gnostics
brahmins
and
mexicans
for
proof
of
its
existence
and
antiquity
among
the
nation
we
refer
the
reader
to
the
travels
chap
ii
of
that
christian
writer
father
acosta
marolles
in
his
memoirs
quotes
tibullus
as
saying
the
pagan
appeased
the
divinity
with
holy
bread
and
tibullus
in
a
panegyric
on
marcella
wrote
a
little
cake
a
little
morsel
of
bread
appeased
the
divinities
and
here
we
discover
the
idea
which
originated
the
ceremony
it
was
started
like
animal
sacrifices
for
the
purpose
of
appeasing
the
wrath
or
propitiating
the
favor
of
the
angry
gods
tracing
the
conception
still
further
in
the
rear
of
its
progress
and
apparently
to
its
primary
inception
higgins
observes
the
whole
paschal
supper
the
supper
with
the
christians
was
in
fact
a
festival
of
joy
to
celebrate
the
passage
of
the
sun
across
the
equinox
of
spring
we
find
one
pagan
writer
who
had
intelligence
enough
to
ridicule
this
senseless
ceremonial
custom
called
the
sacrament
cicero
some
forty
years
before
christ
shows
up
the
doctrine
of
the
sacrament
or
substantiation
in
its
true
light
he
asks
how
can
a
man
be
so
stupid
as
to
imagine
that
which
he
eats
to
be
a
god
a
writer
quoted
above
says
mass
or
the
sacrifice
of
bread
and
wine
was
common
to
many
ancient
nations
anac
vol
ii
p
according
to
alnetonae
the
ancient
brahmins
had
a
kind
of
eucharist
called
prajadam
and
the
same
writer
informs
us
that
the
ancient
peruvians
after
sacrificing
a
lamb
mingled
his
blood
with
flour
and
distributed
it
among
the
people
writers
on
grecian
mythology
relate
that
ceres
the
goddess
of
corn
gave
her
flesh
to
eat
and
that
bacchus
the
god
of
wine
gave
blood
to
drink
nor
is
there
any
evidence
that
christ
and
his
followers
made
a
better
use
or
different
use
or
a
more
spiritual
application
of
the
sacrament
or
ceremonial
offering
of
bread
and
wine
than
the
pagans
did
though
some
have
claimed
this
it
was
a
species
of
symbolism
with
both
notwithstanding
glover
a
christian
writer
declares
that
in
the
sacrament
of
the
altar
are
the
natural
body
and
blood
of
christ
verily
and
indeed
see
glover
remarks
on
bishop
marsh
compendious
review
it
may
be
noted
here
that
the
persians
pythagoreans
essenes
and
gnostics
used
water
instead
of
wine
and
that
this
mode
of
practice
was
less
objectionable
than
that
of
the
christians
who
as
sad
experience
proves
have
too
often
laid
the
foundation
for
the
ruin
of
some
poor
unsuspecting
devotee
by
luring
him
to
the
fatal
fascination
of
the
intoxicating
bowl
by
holding
the
sacred
and
ceremonial
wine
to
his
lips
while
administering

the

ceremony
of
anointing
with

by
way
of
imparting
some
fancied
spiritual
power
and
religious
qualification

to
have

this
accords
exactly
with
the
method

treating
the

in
ancient
india
and
other
heathen
countries
several
thousand
years
ago
for
proof
consult
hyde
bryant
tertullian
and
other
writers
the
custom
of
anointing
the
sick
accompanied
with
prayer
and
other
ceremonies
was
quite
fashionable
in
the
east
long
before
the
birth
of
either
jesus

one
writer
testifies
that
the
practice
of
anointing
with
oil
so
much
in
vogue
among
the
jews
and
sanctioned
by
christ
and
his
followers
was
held
in
high
esteem
in
nearly
all
the
eastern
religions
the
foregoing
historical
facts
furnish
still
further
proof
that
christianity
is
the
offspring
of
heathenism
chapter
xxix
how
men
including
jesus
christ
came
to
be
worshiped
as
gods
jesus
christ
a
demigod
according
to
christian
writers
it
is
truly
surprising
to
observe
the
damaging
concessions
of
some
of
the
early
christian
writers
ruinous
to
the
dogmas
of
their
own
faith
with
respect
to
the
divinity
of
jesus
christ
placing
him
as
they
do
on
an
exact
level
with
the
heathen
demigods
proving
that
the
belief
in
his
divinity
originated
in
the
same
manner
the
belief
in
theirs
did
by
which
it
is
clearly
shown
to
be
a
pagan
derived
doctrine
several
christian
writers
admit
the
belief
in
gods
called
sons
of
gods
and
their
coming
into
the
world
by
human
birth
was
prevalent
among
the
heathen
long
prior
to
the
time
of
christ
hear
the
proof
we
will
first
quote
justin
relative
to
the
prevalence
of
the
belief
among
the
ancient
greeks
and
romans
addressing
them
he
says
the
title
of
son
of
god
as
applied
to
jesus
christ
is
very
justifiable
upon
the
account
of
his
wisdom
considering
you
have
your
mercury
in
your
worship
under
the
title
of
word
or
messenger
of
god
reeves
apol
p
here
is
the
proof
that
the
tradition
of
the
son
of
god
coming
into
the
world
and
the
word
becoming
flesh
was
established
amongst
the
ancient
greeks
and
romans
long
prior
to
the
era
of
christianity
or
the
birth
of
christ
and
yet
more
than
a
hundred
millions
of
christian
professors
can
now
be
found
who
in
their
historic
ignorance
suppose
john
was
the
first
writer
who
taught
the
doctrine
of
the
word
becoming
flesh
and
that
jesus
christ
was
the
first
and
only
begotten
son
of
god
who
ever
made
his
appearance
on
earth
how
true
it
is
that
ignorance
is
the
mother
of
devotion
to
creeds
how
the
man
christ
jesus
came
to
be
worshiped
as
a
god
is
pretty
clearly
indicated
by
bishop
horne
who
shows
that
the
doctrine
of
the
incarnation
was
of
universal
prevalence
long
before
jesus
christ
came
into
the
flesh
he
says
that
god
should
in
some
extraordinary
manner
visit
and
dwell
with
man
is
an
idea
which
as
we
read
the
writings
of
the
ancient
heathen
meets
us
in
a
thousand
different
forms
if
then
the
tradition
of
god
being
born
into
the
world
was
so
universally
established
in
heathen
countries
before
the
christian
era
as
here
shown
why
should
not
and
why
will
not
our
good
christian
brethren
dismiss
their
prejudices
and
tear
the
scales
from
their
eyes
so
as
to
see
that
this
universal
belief
would
as
naturally
lead
to
the
deification
and
worship
of
the
man
christ
jesus
as
water
flows
down
a
descending
plane
and
certainly
a
thousand
times
more
reasonable
is
the
assumption
that
his
deification
originated
in
this
way
than
that
with
all
his
frailties
and
foibles
he
was
entitled
to
the
appellation
of
a
god
a
conclusion
strongly
corroborated
by
the
testimony
of
that
able
christian
writer
norton
who
tells
us
that
many
of
the
first
christians
being
converts
from
gentileism
their
imaginations
were
familiar
with
the
reputed
incarnation
of
heathen
deities
how
natural
it
would
be
for
such
converts
to
worship
the
man
christ
jesus
as
a
god
on
account
of
his
superior
manhood
again
that
ancient
pillar
of
the
christian
church
justin
concedes
that
the
ancient
oriental
heathen
held
all
the
cardinal
doctrines
of
the
christian
faith
relating
to
the
incarnation
long
prior
to
the
introduction
and
establishment
of
christianity
hear
him
addressing
the
pagans
he
says
for
by
declaring
the
logos
the
first
begotten
son
of
god
our
master
jesus
christ
to
be
born
of
a
virgin
without
any
human
mixture
and
to
be
crucified
and
dead
and
to
have
risen
again
into
heaven
we
say
no
more
in
this
than
what
you
say
of
those
whom
you
style
the
sons
of
jove
reeves
apol
vol
p
now
christian
reader
mark
the
several
important
admissions
which
are
made
here
here
is
traced
to
ancient
heathen
tradition
the
belief
in
an
incarnate
son
of
god
the
doctrine
of
a
first
begotten
son
of
god
of
his
being
born
of
a
virgin
of
his
crucifixion
of
his
resurrection
of
his
final
ascension
into
heaven
all
these
cardinal
doctrines
of
christianity
are
here
shown
to
have
been
in
existence
and
to
have
been
preached
by
pagan
priests
long
anterior
to
the
christian
era
thus
entirely
oversetting
the
common
belief
of
christendom
that
these
doctrines
were
never
known
or
preached
in
the
world
until
heralded
by
the
first
disciples
of
the
christian
religion
a
fatal
mistake
truly
this
suicidal
admission
of
st
justin
a
standard
christian
writer
thus
entirely
uptrips
all
pretensions
to
originality
in
the
fundamental
doctrines
of
the
christian
faith
and
shows
it
to
be
a
mere
travesty
of
the
more
ancient
heathen
systems
and
we
have
still
other
testimony
to
corroborate
this
conclusion
the
french
writer
bazin
says
the
most
ancient
histories
are
those
of
gods
becoming
incarnate
in
order
to
govern
mankind
again
he
says
the
idea
sprang
up
everywhere
from
confused
ideas
of
god
which
prevailed
everywhere
among
mankind
that
gods
formerly
descended
upon
earth
the
fertile
imagination
of
the
people
of
various
nations
converted
men
into
gods
and
to
the
same
effect
is
the
declaration
of
higgins
that
there
was
incarnate
gods
in
all
religions
sadly
beclouded
and
warped
indeed
must
be
that
mind
which
can
not
see
that
here
is
set
in
as
plain
view
as
the
cloudless
sun
at
noonday
the
origin
of
the
deification
of
the
man
christ
jesus
no
unbiased
mind
can
possibly
stave
off
the
conclusion
that
such
a
universal
prevalence
of
the
practice
of
throughout
the
religious
world
would
cause
such
a
man
as
jesus
christ
to
be
worshiped
as
a
god
especially
when
we
look
at
the
various
motives
which
promoted
men
to
gods
which
we
will
now
present
motives
to
incarnation
or
the
cause
of
men
being
worshiped
as
gods
the
causes
which
led
to
the
conception
of
gods
and
sons
of
god
becoming
clothed
in
human
flesh
the
manner
in
which
the
absurd
idea
originated
of
an
infinite
being
descending
from
heaven
assuming
the
form
of
a
man
being
born
of
a
pure
and
spotless
virgin
and
finally
being
killed
by
his
own
children
the
subjects
of
his
own
government
are
palpably
plain
and
easily
understood
in
the
light
of
oriental
history
and
at
the
same
time
it
is
so
shockingly
absurd
that
the
rapid
march
of
science
and
civilization
will
soon
inaugurate
the
era
when
the
man
or
woman
who
shall
still
be
found
clinging
to
these
childish
and
superstitious
conceptions
the
offspring
of
ignorance
and
the
relics
of
barbarism
and
a
certain
proof
of
undeveloped
or
unenlightened
minds
will
be
looked
upon
as
deplorably
ignorant
and
superstitious
we
will
proceed
to
enumerate
some
of
the
causes
which
promoted
men
to
the
dignity
of
gods
god
must
come
down
to
suffer
and
sympathize
with
the
people
the
people
of
all
ancient
religious
countries
were
so
that
they
demanded
a
god
whom
they
could
know
by
virtue
of
his
corporeity
really
sympathized
with
their
sorrows
their
sufferings
their
wrongs
and
their
oppressions
and
like
jesus
christ
touched
with
a
feeling
of
our
infirmities
heb
iv
a
god
so
far
invested
with
human
attributes
human
frailties
and
human
sympathies
that
he
could
shoulder
their
burdens
and
their
infirmities
and
take
upon
himself
a
portion
of
their
sufferings
hence
it
is
said
of
christ
himself
took
our
infirmities
matt
iii
the
same
conception
runs
through
the
pagan
systems
one
writer
sets
forth
the
matter
thus
the
creator
occasionally
assumed
a
mortal
form
to
assist
mankind
in
great
emergencies
as
jesus
christ
was
afterward
reported
as
being
the
creator
see
i
and
as
repeated
sojourners
on
earth
in
various
capacities
they
the
saviors
became
practically
acquainted
with
all
the
sorrows
and
temptations
of
humanity
and
could
justly
judge
of
its
sins
while
they
sympathized
with
its
weaknesses
and
its
sufferings
when
they
again
returned
to
the
higher
regions
heaven
they
remembered
the
lower
forms
they
had
dwelt
amongst
and
felt
a
lively
interest
in
the
world
they
had
once
inhabited
they
could
penetrate
even
the
secret
thoughts
of
mortals
the
people
then
demanding
a
god
of
sympathy
and
suffering
as
shown
above
their
credulous
imaginations
would
not
be
long
in
finding
one
let
a
man
rise
up
in
society
endowed
with
an
extraordinary
degree
of
spirituality
and
sympathy
for
human
suffering
let
him
like
chrishna
pythagoras
christ
and
mahomet
spend
his
time
in
visiting
the
hovels
of
the
poor
or
consoling
their
sorrows
laboring
to
mitigate
their
griefs
and
in
performing
acts
of
charity
disinterested
alms
and
deeds
of
benevolence
kindness
and
love
and
so
certain
would
he
sooner
or
later
command
the
homage
of
a
god
for
this
was
always
the
mode
adopted
in
an
ignorant
undeveloped
and
unenlightened
age
for
accounting
not
merely
for
moral
greatness
but
for
every
species
of
mental
and
physical
superiority
as
will
be
hereafter
shown
we
will
proceed
to
notice
the
second
cause
of
men
being
invested
with
divine
attributes
the
people
must
and
would
have
an
external
god
they
could
see
hear
and
talk
to
all
the
oriental
nations
as
well
as
christian
taught
that
god
was
a
spirit
but
no
nation
or
class
of
people
not
even
the
founders
of
christianity
entertained
a
consistent
view
of
the
doctrine
only
a
few
learned
philosophers
saw
the
scientific
impossibility
of
an
infinite
spirit
being
crowded
into
the
human
form
hence
they
alone
were
contented
to
worship
god
in
spirit
and
in
truth
every
religious
nation
went
counter
to
the
spirit
of
this
injunction
in
worshiping
for
a
god
a
being
in
the
human
form
even
the
founders
of
christianity
though
making
high
claims
to
spirituality
were
too
gross
too
sensuous
in
their
conceptions
too
and
too
idolatrous
in
their
feelings
and
proclivities
to
be
content
to
worship
god
in
spirit
hence
their
deification
of
the
man
christ
jesus
to
answer
the
requisition
of
an
external
worship
by
which
they
violated
the
command
to
worship
god
as
a
spirit
that
the
practice
of
promoting
men
to
the
godhead
originated
with
minds
on
the
external
plane
and
evinces
a
want
of
spiritual
development
is
clearly
set
forth
by
the
author
of
the
nineteenth
century
a
christian
writer
who
tells
us
the
idea
of
the
primitive
ages
were
wholly
sensuous
and
the
masses
did
not
believe
in
anything
except
that
which
they
could
touch
see
hear
and
taste
a
true
description
no
doubt
of
the
ancient
pagan
worshipers
of
demigods
but
we
warn
the
christian
reader
not
to
cast
anchor
here
for
we
have
at
our
elbow
abundance
of
christian
testimony
from
the
pens
of
the
very
oracles
of
the
church
to
prove
that
the
same
state
of
things
the
same
state
of
society
the
same
state
of
mind
the
same
proclivity
for
existed
with
the
people
among
whom
christ
was
born
and
that
it
was
owing
to
this
sensuous
idolatrous
state
of
mind
among
his
disciples
that
he
received
the
homage
and
title
of
a
god
hence
the
famous
archbishop
tillotson
says
another
very
common
notion
and
rife
in
the
heathen
world
and
a
great
source
of
their
idolatry
was
their
deification
of
great
men
fit
to
be
worshiped
as
there
was
a
great
inclination
in
mankind
to
the
worship
of
a
visible
deity
so
god
was
pleased
to
appear
in
our
nature
that
they
who
were
fond
of
a
visible
deity
might
have
one
even
a
true
and
natural
incarnation
of
god
the
father
the
express
image
of
his
person
now
we
enjoin
the
reader
to
mark
this
testimony
well
and
impress
it
indelibly
upon
his
memory
according
to
this
orthodox
christian
bishop
jesus
christ
appeared
on
earth
as
a
god
in
condescension
to
the
wishes
of
a
people
too
devoid
of
spirituality
and
too
strongly
inclined
to
idolatry
to
worship
god
as
a
spirit
for
he
admits
the
worship
of
a
or
a
is
a
species
of
idolatry
this
tells
the
whole
story
of
the
apotheosis
of
the
man
christ
jesus
we
have
no
doubt
but
that
here
is
suggested
one
of
the
true
causes
of
his
elevation
to
the
deityship
again
he
says
the
world
was
mightily
bent
on
addressing
their
requests
and
supplications
not
to
the
deity
immediately
but
by
some
mediator
between
the
gods
and
men
see
wadsworth
eccles
biog
p
here
then
we
have
the
most
conclusive
proof
that
the
belief
in
mediators
is
of
pagan
origin
we
will
now
hear
from
another
archbishop
on
this
subject
in
his
caution
to
the
times
p
archbishop
whately
says
as
the
infinite
being
is
an
object
too
remote
and
incomprehensible
for
our
minds
to
dwell
upon
he
has
manifested
himself
in
his
son
the
man
jesus
christ
precisely
so
just
the
kind
of
reasoning
employed
to
account
for
the
worship
of
among
the
heathen
this
logic
fits
one
case
as
well
as
the
other
the
christian
writer
maurice
declares
in
like
manner
we
accept
the
fact
of
the
incarnation
of
jesus
christ
because
we
feel
that
it
is
impossible
to
know
the
absolute
invisible
god
without
an
incarnation
as
man
needs
to
know
him
and
craves
to
know
him
logical
essay
p
here
is
more
pagan
logic
the
same
reasoning
they
employed
to
prove
the
divinity
of
their
saviors
and
demigods
and
the
rev
thomas
arnold
declares
it
the
incarnation
of
christ
was
very
necessary
especially
at
a
time
when
men
were
so
accustomed
to
worship
their
highest
gods
under
the
form
of
men
sermon
on
christian
life
p
let
the
reader
attentively
observe
the
explicit
avowal
here
made
and
mark
well
its
pregnant
inferences
he
makes
jesus
christ
come
into
the
world
in
condescension
to
the
idolatrous
rivalry
of
the
jews
to
be
up
with
the
heathen
nations
in
worshiping
god
in
the
form
of
man
that
is
the
founders
of
christianity
having
been
jews
disclosed
the
true
jewish
character
in
running
after
and
adopting
the
customs
of
heathen
countries
then
so
rife
that
of
hunting
up
a
great
man
and
making
him
a
god
which
was
only
one
case
out
of
many
of
the
jews
adopting
some
of
the
numerous
forms
of
idolatry
and
other
religious
customs
of
their
heathen
neighbors
their
whole
history
as
set
forth
in
the
bible
proves
as
we
have
shown
in
another
chapter
that
they
were
strongly
prone
to
such
acts
it
is
not
strange
therefore
that
they
should
and
did
convert
the
man
christ
jesus
into
a
god
we
will
now
listen
to
another
christian
writer
the
notable
and
noteworthy
chambers
whatever
the
falsely
or
superstitiously
fearful
imagination
conjures
up
because
of
god
being
at
a
distance
can
only
be
dispelled
by
god
being
brought
nigh
to
us
the
veil
which
hides
the
unseen
god
from
the
eyes
of
mortals
must
be
somehow
withdrawn
select
works
vol
iii
p
most
significant
indeed
is
this
species
of
reasoning
it
is
the
same
kind
of
logic
which
had
led
to
the
promotion
of
more
than
a
score
of
great
men
to
the
godhead
among
the
ancient
heathen
the
veil
which
hides
the
unseen
god
must
be
removed
says
dr
chambers
and
so
had
reasoned
in
soliloquy
a
thousand
pagans
long
before
when
determined
to
worship
men
for
gods
it
is
simply
saying
we
are
too
to
worship
god
in
spirit
we
must
and
will
have
a
god
of
flesh
and
blood
a
god
who
can
be
recognized
by
the
external
senses
he
must
become
flesh
and
dwell
amongst
us
see
john
i
our
author
continues
now
all
this
removing
the
veil
from
the
unseen
god
has
been
done
once
and
done
only
once
in
the
person
of
jesus
christ
ibid
mistake
most
fatal
mistake
brother
chambers
it
has
been
done
more
than
a
score
of
times
in
various
heathen
countries
a
fact
which
proves
you
ignorant
of
oriental
history
now
let
the
reader
mark
the
foregoing
citations
from
standard
christian
authors
setting
forth
some
of
the
reasons
which
led
the
founders
of
christianity
to
adopt
a
visible
in
their
worship
in
the
person
of
jesus
christ
language
could
hardly
be
used
to
prove
more
conclusively
that
the
whole
thing
grew
out
of
an
idolatrous
proclivity
to
that
is
the
gross
sensuous
propensity
to
worship
an
extetnal
visible
god
proving
with
the
corroborative
evidence
of
many
other
facts
that
they
were
not
a
whit
above
the
heathen
in
spiritual
development
the
reason
employed
by
the
thibetan
for
the
worship
of
the
hindoo
chrishna
as
a
god
tells
the
whole
story
of
the
worship
and
the
deification
of
jesus
christ
we
could
not
always
have
god
behind
the
clouds
so
we
had
him
come
down
where
we
could
see
him
this
is
the
same
kind
of
reasoning
made
use
of
by
the
christian
writer
above
quoted
all
of
which
discloses
a
state
of
mind
among
both
heathen
and
christians
that
would
not
long
rest
satisfied
without
deifying
somebody
in
order
to
have
a
visible
god
to
worship
and
hence
christians
deified
the
man
christ
jesus
for
this
purpose
the
more
externally
minded
says
fleurbach
the
greater
was
the
determination
to
worship
a
personal
god
god
in
the
form
of
man
and
as
the
jewish
founders
of
christianity
as
every
chapter
of
their
history
demonstrates
were
dwelling
on
the
external
plane
it
was
not
an
act
of
direct
innovation
therefore
for
them
to
fall
into
the
habit
of
worshiping
the
personal
jesus
as
a
god
it
involved
no
serious
incursion
on
previous
thoughts
or
habits
and
warped
and
blinded
indeed
must
be
that
mind
which
can
not
here
discover
the
true
key
to
the
apotheosis
of
jesus
one
of
the
real
causes
of
his
being
stripped
of
his
manhood
and
advanced
to
the
godhead
it
was
as
naturally
to
be
expected
from
the
then
state
of
the
religious
world
and
the
state
of
the
jewish
mind
concerned
in
the
founding
of
christianity
as
that
an
autumnal
crop
of
fruit
should
succeed
the
bloom
of
spring
let
it
be
specially
noted
that
all
the
christian
writers
above
cited
tell
us
in
effect
that
god
sent
his
son
jesus
christ
into
the
world
to
be
worshiped
as
a
god
in
condescension
to
the
ignorance
and
superstitious
tendencies
and
we
will
add
idolatrous
proclivities
of
the
people
from
this
we
challenge
the
world
to
show
why
god
may
not
have
sent
the
oriental
saviors
into
the
world
for
the
same
reason
that
is
in
condescension
to
the
prejudices
of
the
devout
worshipers
under
the
heathen
systems
why
then
is
there
not
as
much
probability
that
he
did
do
so
why
would
he
not
be
as
likely
to
accommodate
their
ignorance
and
prejudices
in
this
way
as
those
of
the
founders
of
the
christian
system
this
question
we
shall
keep
standing
before
the
christian
world
till
it
is
answered
and
we
challenge
them
to
meet
it
and
overthrow
it
if
they
can
men
deified
on
account
of
mental
and
moral
superiority
the
ancient
nations
in
their
entire
ignorance
of
the
philosophy
of
the
human
mind
and
the
laws
controlling
its
actions
always
accounted
for
the
appearance
of
great
men
amongst
them
by
supposing
them
to
be
gods
every
country
occasionally
produced
a
man
who
by
virtue
of
natural
superiority
rose
so
high
in
the
scale
of
moral
and
intellectual
greatness
as
to
fill
the
ideal
of
the
people
with
respect
to
the
characteristics
of
a
god
so
low
so
limited
so
narrow
so
greatly
circumscribed
were
the
conceptions
of
deity
of
the
undeveloped
and
intellectually
dwarfed
minds
of
all
religious
countries
in
that
age
that
a
man
had
to
rise
but
a
few
degrees
above
the
common
level
of
the
populace
to
become
a
god
he
could
easily
fill
the
bill
and
exhibit
all
the
qualities
they
assigned
to
the
highest
god
in
the
heavens
and
this
is
as
true
of
the
jewish
mind
as
that
of
any
other
nation
a
portion
of
whom
adored
jesus
as
a
god
or
if
they
lacked
anything
in
natural
inclination
they
made
it
up
by
imitation
a
propensity
which
they
possessed
in
no
small
degree
that
is
a
proneness
to
imitate
the
customs
of
other
nations
higgins
tells
us
that
men
of
brilliant
intellects
and
high
moral
attainments
and
great
healers
of
which
christ
was
one
were
almost
certain
to
be
deified
in
like
manner
archbishop
tillotson
says
they
deified
famous
and
eminent
persons
by
advancing
them
after
their
death
to
the
dignity
of
an
inferior
kind
of
gods
fit
to
be
worshiped
by
men
on
earth
mark
the
expression
after
their
death
we
have
shown
in
another
chapter
that
jesus
christ
was
not
generally
considered
a
god
even
by
his
followers
till
more
than
three
hundred
years
after
his
death
when
constantine
declared
him
to
be
god
of
very
god
a
circumstance
of
itself
sufficient
to
establish
the
conclusion
that
he
did
not
possess
this
character
a
god
would
be
adored
as
such
by
everybody
while
living
but
a
man
worshipers
rise
up
after
his
death
as
in
the
case
of
the
man
christ
jesus
great
mental
endowments
or
great
moral
attainments
would
in
most
countries
bring
the
most
ignorant
down
on
their
knees
to
worship
such
a
man
as
a
god
but
it
years
and
sometimes
centuries
to
get
him
fully
established
among
the
gods
this
is
as
true
of
jesus
christ
as
the
other
deities
whatever
amount
of
homage
jesus
might
have
received
while
living
any
person
who
will
institute
a
thorough
unbiased
scrutiny
in
the
case
will
discover
that
it
was
his
great
healing
powers
and
superior
mental
qualities
which
finally
deified
him
his
ignorant
admirers
knew
no
way
of
accounting
for
such
extraordinary
qualities
but
to
suppose
him
to
be
the
embodiment
of
infinite
wisdom
like
the
chinaman
who
exclaimed
see
the
god
in
that
man
when
an
englishman
cured
a
young
woman
of
partial
blindness
by
anointing
her
eyes
with
kerosene
such
a
deed
would
deify
almost
any
man
in
almost
any
country
before
the
dawn
of
letters
and
the
recognition
of
the
science
of
mind
the
missionary
rev
allen
method
of
accounting
for
the
deification
of
the
hindoo
god
chrishna
is
so
suggestive
that
we
here
present
it
he
tells
us
that
as
the
exploits
ascribed
to
chrishna
exceed
mere
human
power
the
difficulty
was
removed
by
placing
him
among
the
incarnations
of
vishnu
india
ancient
and
modern
p
exactly
so
we
are
glad
of
such
historic
information
we
hope
the
christian
reader
will
note
the
lesson
it
suggests
for
certainly
every
reader
who
has
not
had
his
reason
shipwrecked
on
the
shoals
of
a
blind
and
dogmatic
theology
can
see
here
a
key
to
unlock
the
great
mystery
of
the
christian
incarnation
the
divinity
of
jesus
christ
as
some
of
the
exploits
of
chrishna
were
supposed
to
exceed
mere
human
power
we
are
told
the
difficulty
was
explained
by
imagining
him
to
be
a
god
how
powerful
the
suggestion
how
conclusive
the
explanation
not
only
for
the
godhood
of
this
savior
but
for
that
of
our
lord
and
savior
jesus
christ
and
all
the
other
lords
and
gods
and
saviors
of
antiquity
a
single
hint
will
sometimes
explain
whole
volumes
of
obscure
history
as
does
this
of
the
rev
christian
hindoo
missionary
allen
and
surely
most
deplorably
blinded
by
superstition
must
be
the
two
hundred
millions
of
christ
worshipers
the
three
hundred
millions
who
worship
chrishna
the
one
hundred
and
twenty
million
adorers
of
confucius
the
fifty
millions
of
suppliants
of
mithra
the
mediator
and
the
one
hundred
and
fifty
millions
of
followers
of
mahomet
who
can
not
see
here
a
satisfactory
solution
of
the
deityship
of
all
these
gods
and
all
the
other
of
antiquity
the
question
is
sometimes
asked
how
could
two
hundred
millions
of
people
come
to
believe
that
jesus
was
a
god
merely
because
of
his
superiority
as
a
man
we
will
answer
by
pointing
to
the
history
of
the
hindoo
chrishna
and
by
asking
the
same
question
with
respect
to
his
godhead
how
could
three
hundred
millions
of
people
be
brought
to
believe
in
his
divinity
and
worship
him
as
a
god
merely
because
he
was
a
superior
human
being
one
question
is
as
easily
answered
as
the
other
and
posterity
will
answer
both
questions
alike
when
we
observe
it
taught
as
an
important
and
easily
learned
lesson
of
history
and
one
based
on
a
thousand
facts
that
no
man
could
rise
to
intellectual
greatness
or
moral
distinction
in
the
era
in
which
christ
was
born
without
being
advanced
to
the
dignity
of
a
god
and
worshiped
as
such
it
is
really
a
source
of
humility
and
sorrow
to
every
unshackled
lover
of
truth
and
humanity
to
reflect
that
there
are
so
many
millions
of
people
whose
mental
vision
is
so
beclouded
by
a
dogmatic
and
inexorable
theology
that
they
can
not
see
the
logical
potency
of
these
facts
that
they
can
not
be
even
moved
by
this
great
and
overwhelming
amount
of
evidence
against
the
divinity
dogma
and
observe
that
it
explodes
it
into
a
thousand
fragments
but
still
cling
to
the
delusion
that
the
man
christ
jesus
with
all
the
human
qualities
and
human
frailties
with
which
his
own
history
the
gospels
invest
him
was
nevertheless
a
god
ay
the
monstrous
delusion
that
any
being
possessing
a
could
be
an
a
most
and
shocking
absurdity
and
we
challenge
all
christendom
to
show
or
approximate
one
inch
toward
showing
that
there
was
sufficient
difference
between
christ
and
chrishna
to
require
us
to
accept
one
as
a
man
and
the
other
as
a
god
it
can
not
be
done
we
have
shown
then
by
the
foregoing
exposition
that
one
cause
of
the
deification
of
men
was
simply
an
attempt
to
solve
the
problem
of
human
greatness
an
attempt
to
account
for
the
moral
and
intellectual
superiority
of
men
which
enabled
them
to
perform
deeds
and
otherwise
exhibit
a
character
far
above
the
capacity
of
the
multitude
to
comprehend
and
which
they
could
find
no
other
way
to
account
for
than
to
suppose
them
to
be
gods
while
the
low
and
groveling
conceptions
which
most
religious
nations
and
especially
the
jews
had
formed
of
the
character
and
essential
attributes
of
the
infinite
deity
often
investing
him
with
the
most
ignoble
human
attributes
human
passions
and
human
imperfections
made
it
perfectly
easy
to
convert
their
great
men
by
imagination
into
gods
the
jews
represented
god
not
only
as
a
coming
down
from
heaven
in
propria
persona
and
walking
talking
wrestling
as
a
man
on
one
occasion
we
are
told
he
and
jacob
scuffled
all
night
but
he
is
often
represented
as
acting
the
part
of
a
wicked
man
such
as
lying
see
chron
getting
mad
see
deut
i
swearing
sanctioning
the
highhanded
and
demoralizing
crimes
of
stealing
see
ex
iii
of
robbery
see
ex
xii
of
murder
see
deut
xiii
and
even
fornication
see
xxxi
and
num
xxxi
and
thus
they
invested
diety
with
such
mean
low
despicable
attributes
as
to
reduce
his
moral
character
to
a
level
with
the
most
immoral
man
in
society
so
that
it
was
very
easy
if
not
very
natural
to
elevate
their
great
men
if
it
really
required
any
elevation
to
a
level
with
their
god
men
and
gods
were
in
character
and
conception
so
nearly
alike
that
it
was
easy
to
bring
them
on
a
level
or
to
mistake
one
for
the
other
and
hence
it
is
we
find
an
incarnated
god
savior
son
of
god
redeemer
figuring
in
the
early
history
of
nearly
every
oriental
religious
nation
whose
name
and
history
has
descended
to
us
indeed
the
practice
of
deifying
men
or
mistaking
men
for
gods
was
once
so
common
so
nearly
universal
that
it
must
require
a
mind
very
ignorant
of
oriental
history
to
adore
jesus
christ
as
having
been
the
only
character
of
this
kind
who
figured
in
the
religious
world
it
was
as
before
suggested
deemed
the
most
rational
way
of
accounting
for
the
marked
superiority
among
men
to
suppose
that
some
men
had
a
divine
birth
and
were
begotten
by
the
great
infinite
deity
himself
and
descended
to
the
earth
through
the
purest
human
virgin
channel
as
higgins
remarks
every
person
who
possessed
a
striking
superiority
of
mind
either
for
talent
or
goodness
was
supposed
anciently
to
have
a
portion
of
the
divine
mind
or
essence
incorporated
or
incarnated
in
him
the
jews
had
a
number
of
men
whose
names
imply
a
participation
in
the
divine
nature
among
which
we
will
cite
elijah
and
elisha
and
el
being
the
hebrew
name
or
term
for
god
while
jah
is
jehovah
see
ps
lxviii
and
sha
means
a
savior
elijah
then
is
an
approximation
to
god
jehovah
and
elisha
is
god
a
savior
the
character
of
men
and
gods
were
cast
in
molds
so
approximately
similar
so
nearly
identical
as
to
make
the
transition
or
change
from
one
to
the
other
so
slight
and
easy
either
of
men
into
gods
or
gods
into
men
that
several
nations
went
so
far
as
to
teach
that
a
man
might
by
his
own
natural
exertions
his
own
voluntary
powers
raise
himself
to
a
level
with
the
diety
and
thereby
become
a
god
ritter
in
his
history
of
ancient
philosophy
chap
ii
tells
us
that
some
of
the
budhist
sect
held
that
a
man
by
freeing
himself
by
holiness
of
conduct
from
the
obstacles
of
nature
may
deliver
his
fellows
from
the
corruption
of
the
times
and
become
a
benefactor
and
redeemer
of
his
race
and
also
even
become
a
god
a
budha
a
savior
and
son
of
god
singular
enough
that
the
christian
should
object
to
this
doctrine
as
being
rather
blasphemous
when
his
own
bible
abundantly
and
explicitly
teaches
the
same
doctrine
in
effect
we
find
the
same
thing
substantially
taught
over
and
over
again
in
the
christian
scriptures
be
ye
perfect
even
as
your
father
in
heaven
is
perfect
matt
requires
a
man
to
become
morally
perfect
as
god
which
is
all
that
the
budhist
precept
requires
or
contemplates
and
no
man
can
become
perfect
as
god
without
becoming
a
god
but
we
are
not
left
to
mere
inference
in
the
matter
we
have
the
doctrine
several
times
expressed
and
unquestionably
taught
in
the
christian
bible
of
power
and
prerogative
to
become
either
a
god
or
son
of
god
said
i
not
that
ye
are
gods
ex
iv
behold
now
we
are
the
sons
of
god
i
john
i
here
is
the
budhist
doctrine
as
explicitly
stated
as
it
can
be
taught
it
is
then
a
christian
bible
doctrine
as
well
as
a
pagan
doctrine
that
man
can
become
a
god
and
that
god
can
be
born
of
woman
and
thereby
invested
with
all
the
frail
and
imperfect
attributes
of
man
it
can
not
be
considered
a
matter
of
marvel
therefore
that
so
many
of
the
good
the
great
and
the
wise
men
of
almost
every
country
including
the
man
christ
jesus
should
be
honored
and
adored
with
the
titles
of
deity
and
worshiped
as
god
absolute
son
of
god
savior
redeemer
intercessor
mediator
god
comes
down
and
is
incarnated
to
fight
and
conquer
the
devil
we
will
proceed
to
enumerate
other
causes
and
motives
which
conspired
in
various
cases
to
invest
some
one
or
more
of
the
great
men
of
a
nation
with
divine
honors
and
adore
them
as
veritable
gods
and
saviors
come
down
to
us
in
the
form
of
men
it
was
a
tenant
of
faith
with
most
of
the
ancient
religions
that
almost
at
the
dawn
of
human
existence
a
devil
or
evil
principle
found
its
way
into
the
world
to
the
great
discomfiture
of
man
and
the
no
small
annoyance
of
the
supreme
creator
himself
and
that
hence
there
must
needs
be
a
savior
a
redeemer
an
intercessor
to
combat
and
if
possible
destroy
the
devil
and
his
works
for
this
purpose
appeared
the
savior
chrishna
in
india
the
savior
osiris
in
egypt
the
god
or
mediator
mithra
in
persia
the
redeemer
quexalcote
in
mexico
the
savior
jesus
christ
in
judea
in
the
initiatory
chapter
on
the
transgression
and
fall
of
man
some
of
the
oriental
bibles
graphically
describe
the
scene
of
the
war
in
heaven
a
counterpart
to
the
story
of
john
as
found
in
the
twelfth
chapter
of
revelation
wherein
michael
and
the
dragon
are
represented
as
the
captains
and
of
their
respective
embattled
hosts
and
in
which
the
former
was
crowned
as
victor
in
the
contest
as
he
succeeded
in
vanquishing
and
casting
out
the
evil
one
in
the
pagan
military
drama
the
scene
of
the
war
in
heaven
is
transferred
to
the
earth
a
god
a
savior
a
son
of
god
comes
down
to
put
a
stop
to
the
machinations
of
the
evil
one
to
destroy
the
devil
and
his
works
as
we
are
told
christ
came
for
that
purpose
john
iii
see
the
author
biography
of
satan
the
egyptian
story
runs
thus
osiris
appeared
on
earth
to
benefit
mankind
and
after
he
had
performed
the
duties
of
his
mission
and
had
fallen
a
sacrifice
to
typhon
the
devil
or
evil
principle
which
however
he
eventually
overcame
the
wicked
one
john
ii
by
rising
from
the
dead
after
being
crucified
he
became
the
judge
of
mankind
in
a
future
state
see
kerrick
ancient
egypt
also
wilkinson
egypt
the
budhist
or
hindoo
version
of
the
story
is
on
this
wise
the
prince
of
darkness
or
evil
spirit
ravana
or
mahesa
got
into
a
contest
and
a
war
with
the
divine
hero
rama
in
which
the
latter
proved
victorious
and
put
to
flight
the
army
of
wicked
one
but
not
till
after
considerable
injury
had
been
done
to
the
human
family
and
the
whole
order
of
the
universe
subverted
to
rectify
which
and
to
achieve
a
final
and
complete
triumph
over
ravana
the
devil
and
his
works
and
thus
save
the
human
race
from
utter
destruction
the
gods
besought
vishnu
the
second
person
of
the
trinity
to
descend
to
the
earth
and
take
upon
himself
the
form
and
flesh
of
man
and
it
was
argued
that
as
the
mission
appertained
to
man
the
god
vishnu
when
he
descended
to
the
earth
in
the
capacity
of
a
savior
should
become
half
man
and
half
god
and
that
the
most
feasible
way
to
accomplish
this
end
was
for
him
to
be
born
of
a
woman
and
that
the
glory
and
honor
of
his
triumph
over
ravana
the
devil
would
be
greater
if
achieved
in
this
capacity
than
if
he
were
to
come
down
from
heaven
and
conquer
ravana
wholly
with
his
attributes
as
a
god
or
wholly
in
his
divine
character
as
absolute
god
uninvested
with
human
nature
the
suggestion
was
approved
by
vishnu
who
descended
and
took
upon
himself
the
form
of
man
the
form
of
a
servant
phil
ii
and
that
his
metamorphosis
or
life
might
be
the
purer
it
was
decided
that
he
should
be
born
of
a
woman
wholly
uncontaminated
with
man
that
is
a
virgin
and
thus
far
back
in
the
midnight
of
mythology
and
fable
originated
the
story
of
divine
saviors
and
gods
being
born
of
virgins
a
conception
now
found
incorporated
in
the
religious
histories
of
various
ancient
nations
and
now
let
us
observe
how
substantially
the
christian
story
of
a
savior
conforms
to
the
above
jesus
like
the
saviors
of
india
and
egypt
was
believed
to
be
a
half
man
and
half
god
and
reputedly
he
came
into
the
world
like
them
to
destroy
the
devil
and
his
works
or
the
works
of
the
devil
that
is
to
put
an
end
to
the
evil
or
malignant
principle
introduced
into
the
world
by
the
serpent
in
the
garden
of
eden
as
it
is
declared
the
seed
of
the
woman
shall
bruise
the
serpent
head
iii
which
is
interpreted
as
referring
to
christ
and
like
these
and
various
other
pagan
saviors
jesus
is
assigned
the
highest
and
most
ennobling
human
origin
a
birth
from
a
virgin
and
as
in
the
instances
above
named
jesus
had
also
several
encounters
with
the
devil
first
in
the
wilderness
then
on
a
mountain
and
finally
like
them
falls
a
sacrifice
to
his
insidious
malignant
power
acting
through
the
agency
and
mediumship
of
judas
iscariot
for
his
betrayal
is
ascribed
wholly
to
satan
whom
john
called
the
serpent
entering
into
judas
and
prompting
the
act
see
rev
xii
and
thus
christ
like
the
other
saviors
falls
a
victim
to
the
serpentine
or
satanic
power
acting
through
the
instrumentality
of
a
judas
iscariot
but
finally
triumphed
like
the
savior
of
egypt
osiris
by
rising
from
the
dead
the
first
fruits
of
immortality
and
thus
the
stories
run
parallel
the
more
modern
christian
with
the
more
ancient
pagan
for

of
the
belief
and

respecting
a

extraordinary
revelations
in
history
and
science
recent
explorations
in
the
field
of
oriental
sacred
history
have
revealed
to
the
antiquarian
some
curious
and
deeply
interesting
facts
appertaining
to
traditions
founded
on
and
growing
out
of
astronomical
phenomena
and
changes
in
the
visible
heavens
which
throw
much
light
on
and
go
far
toward
elucidating
and
furnishing
a
satisfactory
explanation
of
many
of
the
mysteries
of
the
christian
bible
the
works
which
we
have
consulted
containing
the
reports
and
results
of
researches
of
this
character
tend
to
elucidate
and
establish
the
following
conclusions
that
anciently
in
religious
countries
time
was
divided
into
cycles
aetas
or
neros
that
these
measures
of
time
grew
out
of
and
represented
periodical
changes
or
periodically
occurring
phenomena
in
the
astronomical
heavens
that
some
religious
nations
had
three
cycular
periods
of
different
lengths
representing
three
orders
and
degrees
of
miraculous
births
in
india
the
length
of
the
first
or
shorter
cycle
was
thirty
days
the
length
of
one
moon
or
month
every
change
of
the
moon
marked
an
important
event
in
their
religious
history
each
change
was
supposed
to
denote
the
birth
of
some
angel
or
celestial
being
known
as
an
eon
the
second
cycular
period
was
of
six
hundred
years
duration
and
was
founded
on
a
text
of
the
sacred
book
of
india
known
as
the
surya
sidhanta
which
declares
the
equinoctial
point
moves
eastward
one
degree
in
thirty
times
twenty
years
thirty
times
twenty
being
at
every
occurrence
of
this
equinoctial
change
hightened
by
an
eclipse
of
the
sun
or
moon
or
some
other
phenomenon
a
god
was
supposed
to
be
born
such
a
marvelous
and
event
in
the
apprehensions
of
the
credulous
and
superstitious
populace
of
an
unscientific
age
could
not
be
designed
for
anything
less
than
the
birth
of
a
god
or
divine
savior
their
theology
teaches
that
such
was
the
wickedness
of
man
that
a
god
had
to
descend
from
heaven
and
suffer
and
die
for
the
people
in
some
way
every
six
hundred
years
and
this
period
was
announced
by
the
god
causing
a
collision
of
the
sun
and
moon
or
some
other
phenomena
in
the
heavens
above
or
the
earth
beneath
when
one
of
these
six
hundred
cycular
periods
was
about
to
expire
and
another
commence
every
remarkable
phenomenon
in
the
heavens
was
watched
and
interpreted
as
being
connected
with
it
and
some
person
born
at
that
period
who
exhibited
any
remarkable
or
extraordinary
trait
of
character
was
certain
to
be
promoted
to
the
godhead
as
being
miraculously
born
and
brought
forth
for
the
special
occasion
he
was
the
avatar
savior
or
messiah
for
that
cycle
there
were
two
extraordinary
events
to
be
accounted
for
one
was
the
display
of
unusual
and
phenomena
in
the
heavens
and
the
other
the
birth
of
extraordinary
men
on
earth
and
it
was
natural
for
an
ignorant
age
to
associate
them
together
and
make
one
aid
in
accounting
for
the
other
and
as
these
celestial
phenomena
were
only
witnessed
at
intervals
distant
apart
the
thought
naturally
arose
and
the
conclusion
was
easily
established
that
they
came
periodically
and
for
the
special
purpose
of
heralding
the
birth
of
a
god
and
as
tradition
reported
that
similar
events
were
witnessed
six
hundred
years
before
the
conviction
was
fixed
in
the
popular
mind
this
was
the
established
period
intervening
between
these
great
epochs
and
thus
the
six
hundred
year
cycular
tradition
became
established
in
india
and
finally
spread
through
all
the
eastern
countries
we
find
traces
of
it
in
egypt
syria
persia
chaldea
china
italy
and
judea
and
the
proof
that
the
deification
of
great
men
in
some
countries
grew
out
of
this
cycular
tradition
is
found
in
the
fact
that
many
of
them
were
born
at
the
commencement
of
cycles
the
hindoos
are
able
to
recount
the
names
of
ten
saviors
who
made
their
appearance
on
earth
at
these
regular
intervals
of
six
hundred
years
the
name
of
the
first
avatar
mediator
and
savior
who
forsook
the
throne
of
heaven
to
come
down
and
die
for
the
people
was
matsa
tradition
and
the
sacred
books
fix
his
birth
at
about
six
thousand
years
the
names
and
advent
of
the
other
saviors
occur
in
the
following
order
vurahay
kurma
nursu
waman
pursuram
kama
chrishna
sakia
salavahana
the
last
named
savior
was
cotemporary
with
jesus
christ
the
god
and
savior
sakia
was
born
six
hundred
years
our
lord
and
savior
and
son
of
god
chrisna
was
immaculately
conceived
and
miraculously
born
according
to
higgins
a
circumstance
strongly
confirming
the
conclusion
that
cycular
periods
had
much
to
do
with
the
promotion
of
men
to
the
dignity
of
gods
is
that
most
of
the
deified
personages
reported
in
history
were
according
to
the
best
authorities
born
near
the
commencement
of
cycles
recurring
back
to
the
eighth
cycle
we
observe
the
advent
of
that
period
of
chrishna
zoroaster
bali
thammuz
atys
osiris
and
several
others
at
the
commencement
of
the
ninth
cycle
appeared
sakia
quexalcote
zoroaster
xion
qairious
prometheus
mithra
and
many
others
the
tenth
cycle
brought
in
jesus
christ
salavhana
apollonious
and
others
that
might
be
named
mahomet
succeeded
jesus
christ
just
six
hundred
years
he
was
born
in
the
year
which
inaugurated
another
cycle
many
facts
are
recorded
in
history
proving
the
prevalence
and
sacredness
of
the
cycle
idea
in
different
countries
the
story
in
egypt
of
the
bird
called
the
phoenix
being
hatched
according
to
tradition
just
years
and
living
to
be
just
six
hundred
years
old
and
having
the
power
to
renew
itself
every
six
hundred
years
shows
the
prevalence
of
the
cycular
tradition
in
that
country
we
have
the
statement
upon
the
records
of
history
that
when
the
first
six
hundred
years
after
the
foundation
of
rome
were
about
to
expire
the
people
became
greatly
excited
with
the
apprehension
that
some
extraordinary
event
must
attend
the
occasion
and
but
for
the
influence
of
the
philosophers
some
extraordinary
man
would
have
been
hunted
up
and
promoted
to
divine
honor
as
being
the
god
born
for
that
cycle
the
writings
of
plato
plutarch
ovid
cicero
virgil
and
aristotle
all
evince
a
belief
in
cycles
and
the
belief
that
ten
cycles
or
aetas
were
the
measure
for
the
duration
of
the
world
according
to
faber
a
savior
was
always
expected
to
make
his
appearance
at
the
commencement
of
one
of
these
cycles
hence
the
deification
of
those
personages
above
named
and
many
others
that
might
be
named
it
is
a
remarkable
circumstance
that
the
jewish
bible
should
speak
of
noah
as
being
six
hundred
years
old
at
the
commencement
of
the
flood
when
it
was
a
tradition
amongst
the
ancient
egyptians
that
the
ushering
in
of
the
six
hundreth
year
cycle
was
to
be
attended
with
a
flood
and
the
time
antecedent
to
noah
after
creation
was
the
measure
of
three
cycles
according
to
the
chronology
of
the
samaritan
bible
it
being
years
from
adam
to
noah
it
is
an
interesting
fact
that
those
enigmatical
figures
made
use
of
by
daniel
as
also
some
of
those
found
in
the
apocalypse
are
susceptible
of
a
cycular
explanation
these
occult
prophecies
as
they
are
supposed
to
be
which
have
puzzled
and
bewildered
many
thousands
of
christian
minds
and
bible
expounders
in
their
attempt
to
evolve
their
signification
are
susceptible
of
a
cycular
explanation
they
are
of
easy
solution
on
a
cycular
basis
or
with
the
cycular
key
take
for
example
daniel
famous
prophecy
so
called
of
the
seventy
weeks
as
found
in
the
ninth
chapter
announcing
the
advent
of
a
messiah
at
the
end
of
that
period
we
find
by
a
calculation
based
on
historical
atlas
and
haskell
chronology
and
universal
history
that
daniel
lived
in
the
hundred
and
tenth
year
of
the
ninth
cycle
at
which
time
the
prefigure
seems
to
have
been
used
assuming
this
as
a
basis
and
multiplying
seventy
weeks
by
seven
to
convert
it
into
years
as
christian
essayists
are
accustomed
to
doing
and
we
have
as
the
result
which
being
added
to
one
hundred
and
ten
the
year
that
gave
birth
to
the
prophesy
makes
six
hundred
which
exactly
completes
the
cycle
and
furnishes
a
simple
and
beautiful
explanation
of
a
mystical
figure
on
which
many
thousands
of
conjectures
speculations
and
guesses
have
been
founded
but
on
which
they
have
failed
to
throw
any
light
the
years
were
wanting
to
complete
the
cycle
and
when
this
rolled
away
it
brought
a
new
cycle
and
with
it
a
new
savior
was
always
expected
in
some
countries
the
country
in
which
daniel
lived
being
one
of
this
number
a
new
messiah
or
savior
and
some
great
man
born
at
that
time
was
fixed
upon
and
deified
as
being
that
messiah
hence
the
jews
in
imitation
of
their
neighbors
yielding
to
their
strong
proclivities
to
borrow
from
and
copy
after
heathen
nations
selected
the
man
christ
jesus
as
their
messiah
and
savior
the
mystical
era
of
daniel
signified
by
a
time
times
and
the
dividing
of
time
dan
vii
or
as
john
has
it
a
time
times
and
a
half
time
see
rev
xii
is
explainable
by
the
same
cycular
key
some
writers
have
conjectured
that
daniel
was
a
chaldean
priest
if
so
he
must
have
had
a
knowledge
of
their
astronomical
cycle
of
two
thousand
one
hundred
and
sixty
years
which
completed
the
period
of
the
precession
of
the
equinoxes
explained
by
this
cycle
his
time
times
and
dividing
of
time
or
half
time
or
a
time
another
time
and
a
half
time
as
some
writers
have
rendered
it
would
be
f
nine
cycles
exactly
as
add
this
to
the
cycle
in
which
he
lived
and
we
have
the
great
millennial
cycle
when
not
only
a
new
savior
and
messiah
was
to
be
born
but
a
new
world
also
both
the
long
and
short
cycle
and
one
was
a
measure
of
the
other
were
expected
to
expire
at
that
time
according
to
a
chaldean
tradition
and
thus
is
beautifully
explained
another
deep
dark
and
unfathomable
mystery
which
thousands
of
devout
minds
have
exhausted
their
ingenuity
in
trying
to
find
a
meaning
for
again
look
at
the
frightful
nightmare
visions
of
daniel
and
the
author
of
the
apocalypse
in
which
they
saw
a
monstrous
beast
with
seven
heads
and
ten
horns
though
daniel
mentions
only
the
horns
the
seven
heads
were
in
all
probability
the
seven
auspicious
months
of
the
year
in
which
some
of
the
nations
revealed
in
the
enjoyment
of
and
praised
and
celebrated
their
fruitful
bountiful
blessings
the
year
being
divided
into
two
seasons
seven
summer
months
and
five
winter
months
now
let
it
be
noted
john
lived
near
the
tenth
cycle
which
answers
to
the
ten
horns
of
the
beast
hence
is
most
forcibly
suggested
that
interpretation
of
the
figure
daniel
ten
horns
should
have
been
translated
eleven
horns
as
he
lived
in
the
ninth
cycle
though
so
near
the
tenth
that
he
probably
constructed
his
figure
on
the
tenth
and
daniel
prophetic
declaration
so
considered
found
in
the
eighth
chapter
that
it
would
be
two
thousand
three
hundred
days
until
the
sanctuary
should
be
closed
is
explainable
in
the
same
manner
according
to
irving
frere
and
other
writers
there
was
a
large
fraction
over
the
three
hundred
days
making
it
nearer
four
hundred
and
hence
might
have
been
so
rendered
which
would
make
the
exact
length
of
four
cycles
and
their
are
other
mystical
figures
frightful
visions
and
occult
metaphors
found
in
the
apocalypse
susceptible
of
a
cycular
solution
the
cycle
is
the
true
key
for
unlocking
many
of
the
ancient
mysteries
of
various
religions
the
chinese
have
always
reckoned
by
cycles
of
sixty
years
instead
of
by
centuries

we
will
now
bestow
a
brief
notice
on
the
millennial
cycle
the
sacred
period
of
years
composed
of
ten
of
the
smaller
cycles
hales
says
a
tradition
of
millennial
ages
prevailed
throughout
the
east
and
finally
reached
the
west
chron
vol
p
we
are
told
by
astronomers
that
if
the
angle
which
the
plane
of
the
ecliptic
forms
with
the
plane
of
the
equator
had
decreased
gradually
as
it
was
once
supposed
to
do
the
two
planes
would
coincide
in
about
six
thousand
years
a
period
which
comprises
ten
of
the
smaller
cycles
and
it
was
very
easy
and
very
natural
for
an
ignorant
and
superstitious
age
to
conclude
that
such
a
prodigious
astounding
and
awful
event
as
that
of
two
stupendous
orbits
or
planes
coming
in
contact
with
each
other
should
be
attended
with
some
direful
and
calamitous
event
and
with
a
tremendous
display
of
divine
power
nothing
less
than
an
entire
revolution
if
not
the
total
destruction
of
the
world
could
comport
with
the
majesty
and
magnitude
of
such
an
event
and
this
great
crisis
was
to
bring
down
the
omnipotent
divine
judge
from
the
throne
of
heaven
that
is
the
almighty
being
who
caused
it
was
to
come
down
or
send
his
son
to
call
the
nations
to
judgment
and
drown
the
world
or
set
it
on
fire
the
first
destruction
according
to
the
tradition
of
the
chaldeans
persians
assyrians
mexicans
and
some
other
nations
was
to
be
by
water
and
the
next
by
fire
when
the
oceans
seas
and
lakes
were
to
be
converted
into
ashes
and
apostles
seemed
to
have
cherished
this
tradition
peter
says
whereby
the
world
that
was
then
being
overflowed
by
water
perished
but
the
heavens
and
the
earth
which
are
now
by
the
same
word
are
kept
in
store
reserved
unto
fire
against
the
day
of
judgment
peter
iii
this
was
a
pagan
belief
long
prior
to
the
era
of
peter
josephus
says
adam
predicted
that
the
world
would
be
twice
destroyed
once
by
water
next
by
fire
a
writer
says
a
glorious
blissful
future
attends
the
destruction
of
the
world
by
fire
and
the
reappearance
of
vishnu
eleventh
incarnation
of

been
for
several
thousand

hopeful
anticipation
of

last
coming
of
vishnu
in
power
and
glory
says
another
writer
to
consummate
the
final
overthrow
of
evil
sin
and
death
is
so
firmly
fixed
in
the
minds
of
the
devotees
that
they
have
an
annual
festival
in
commemoration
of
their
prophesy
referring
to
it
at
which
they
exclaim
in
a
loud
voice
will
the
divine
helper
come
when
will
the
deliverer
appear
at
the
consummation
of
this
event
a
comet
will
roll
under

moon
and
set

affirms

manner
predicts
that

star
with

tail
in

will
be
wrapped
in
flames

mutually
destroy

the
egyptians
marked
their
houses
with
red
to
indicate
that
the
world
would
be
destroyed
by
fire
orpheus
at
the
inauguration
of
the
eighth
cycle
entertained
fearful
forebodings
of
the
speedy
destruction
of
the
world
by
water
or
fire
some
nations
held
that
the
alternate
destruction
of
the
world
by
water
and
fire
had
already
occurred
and
would
occur
again
theopompus
informs
us
that
some
of
the
orientalists
believed
that
the
god
of
light
and
the
god
of
darkness
reigned
by
turn
every
six
thousand
years
commencing
with
an
astronomical
cycle
of
course
and
that
during
this
period
the
other
was
held
in
subjection
which
finally
resulted
in
a
war
in
heaven
a
counterpart
to
john
story
see
rev
chap
xii
this
accords
with
volney
statement
that
it
was
recorded
in
the
sacred
books
of
the
persians
and
chaldeans
that
the
world
composed
of
a
total
revolution
of
twelve
thousand
periods
was
divided
into
two
partial
revolutions
of
six
thousand
years
each
one
being
the
reign
of
good
and
the
other
the
reign
of
evil
ruins
p
this
belief
was
disseminated
through
most
of
the
nations
one
of
these
revolutions
was
produced
some
believed
by
a
concussion
of
worlds
which
displaced
the
ocean
and
seas
and
thus
produced
a
general
flood
which
drowned
every
living
thing
on
the
earth
the
next
revolution
will
be
caused
by
a
collision
of
worlds
which
will
produce
fire
and
burn
the
earth
to
ashes
now
let
it
be
noted
that
all
of
these
grand
epochs
were
founded
on
cycles
and
accompanied
by
the
tradition
of
a
god
being
born
upon
the
earth
conceived
by
a
virgin
maid
or
descending
in
person
that
is
men
were
promoted
to
the
godhead
and
in
this
way
jesus
christ
was
deified
volney
explains
the
matter
thus
now
according
to
the
jewish
computation
six
thousand
years
had
nearly
elapsed
since
the
supposed
creation
of
the
world
according
to
their
chronology
this
coincidence
produced
considerable
fermentation
in
the
minds
of
the
people
nothing
was
thought
of
but
the
approaching
termination
the
great
mediator
and
final
judge
was
expected
and
his
advent
desired
that
an
end
might
be
put
to
their
calamities
ruins
higgins
corroborates
this
statement
when
he
tells
us
that
about
the
time
of
the
cæsars
there
seems
to
have
been
a
general
expectation
that
some
great
one
was
to
appear
and
finally
when
the
cycle
had
passed
the
people
the
began
to
look
about
to
see
who
that
great
one
was
some
fixed
on
herod
some
on
julius
cæsar
and
some
on
others
but
finally
public
opinion
settled
on
one
jesus
of
nazareth
on
account
of
his
superiority
in
morals
and
intellect
while
the
hindoos
deified
salavahana
the
greeks
apollonious
and
thus
science
and
history
join
hand
in
hand
to
explain
most
beautifully
and
conclusively
the
greatest
mystery
that
ever
brought
two
hundred
millions
of
people
daily
upon
their
knees
the
apotheosis

deification
of
the

christianity
derived
from
heathen
and
oriental
systems
more
than
twenty
thousand
sermons
are
preached
in
the
christian
pulpits
on
every
recurring
sabbath
to
convince
the
people
that
the
religion
and
morality
taught
and
practiced
by
jesus
christ
was
of
divine
emanation
and
was
never
before
taught
in
the
world
that
his
system
of
morality
was
without
a
parallel
and
his
practical
life
without
a
precedent
that
the
doctrine
of
humility
unselfishness
benevolence
and
charity
also
devout
piety
kind
treatment
of
enemies
and
love
for
the
human
race
which
he
preached
and
practiced
had
never
before
been
exemplified
in
the
life
and
teachings
of
any
individual
or
nation
but
a
thorough
acquaintance
with
the
history
and
moral
systems
of
some
of
the
oriental
nations
and
the
practical
lives
of
piety
and
exemplified
in
their
leading
men
long
anterior
to
the
birth
of
christ
and
long
before
the
name
of
christianity
was
anywhere
known
must
convince
any
unprejudiced
mind
that
such
a
claim
is
without
foundation
and
to
prove
it
we
will
here
institute
a
critical
comparison
between
christianity
and
some
of
the
older
systems
with
respect
to
the
essential
spirit
of
their
teachings
and
observe
how
utterly
untenable
and
groundless
is
the
dogmatic
assumption
which
claims
for
the
christian
religion
either
any
originality
or
any
superiority
of
course
if
their
is
nothing
new
or
original
there
is
nothing
superior
we
will
first
arrange
christianity
side
by
side
with
the
ancient
system
known
as
essenism
a
religion
whose
origin
has
never
been
discovered
though
it
is
known
that
the
essenes
existed
in
the
days
of
jonathan
maccabeus
and
that
they
were
of
jewish
origin
and
constituted
one
of
the
three
jewish
sects
the
other
two
being
pharisees
and
sadducees
we
have
but
fragments
of
their
history
as
furnished
by
philo
josephus
pliny
and
their
copyists
eusebius
ginsburg
and
others
on
whose
authority
we
will
proceed
to
show
that
alexandrian
and
judean
essenism
was
identically
the
same
system
in
spirit
and
essence
as
its
successor
judean
christianity
in
other
words
judean
christianity
teaches
the
same
doctrines
and
moral
precepts
which
had
been
previously
inculcated
by
the
disciples
of
the
essenian
religion
a
parallel
exhibition
of
the
precepts
and
practical
lives
of
christ
and
the
essenes
we
will
condense
from
philo
josephus
and
other
authors
philo
says
it
is
our
first
duty
to
seek
the
kingdom
of
god
and
his
righteousness
so
the
essenes
believed
and
taught
seek
first
the
kingdom
of
god
and
his
righteousness
and
all
else
shall
be

says
they
abjured
all
amusements
all
elegances
and
all
pleasures
of
the
senses
forsake
the
world
and
the
things
thereof
the
essenes
say
lay
up
nothing
on
earth
but
fix
your
mind
solely
on
heaven
lay
not
up
treasures
on
earth
the
essenes
having
laid
aside
all
the
anxieties
of
life
says
philo
and
leaving

they
make
their
residence
in
solitary
wilds

they
wandered
in

josephus
says
they
neither
buy
nor

their

had
need
acts

eusebius
says
even
as
it
is
related
in
the
acts
of
the

all
the
esseues
were
wont
to
sell
their
possessions
and
their
substance
and
divide
among
all
according
as
any
one
had
need
so
that
there
was
not
one
among
them
in
want
neither
was
their
any
among
them
that
lacked
for
as
many

brought
the

that
were

eusebius
says
for

thereof
and
laid
them
at
the

distribution
was

us
says

their
religion
whosoever
forsaketh
not
father
and
mother
houses
and
lands
can
not
be
my
disciples
their
being
sometimes
called
was
owing
to
their
abstraction
from
the
world
says

they
are
not
of
the
world
even
as
i
am
not
of

present
the
reader
with
a
general
description
of

as
furnished
us
by
philo
josephus
and
some
christian
writers
philo
who
was
born
in
alexandria
and
lived
to
and
who
was
himself
an
essenian
jew
in
his
account
of
them
says
they
do
not
lay
up
treasures
of
gold
or
silver
but
provide
themselves
only
with
the
necessities
of
life
paul
afterwards
having
caught
the
same
spirit
advises
the
same
course
of
life

food
and
raiment
therewith
be
content
contentment
of
mind
they
regarded
as
the
greatest
of
riches
they
make
no
instruments
of
war
they
repudiate
every
inducement
to
covetousness
none
are
held
as
slaves
but
all
are
free
and
serve
each
other
they
are
instructed
in
piety
and
holiness
righteousness
economy
they
are
guided
by
a
threefold
rule
love
of
god
love
of
virtue
and
love
of
mankind
of
their
love
of
god
they
give
innumerable
demonstrations
which
is
found
in
their
constant
and
unalterable
holiness
throughout
the
whole
of
their
lives
their
avoidance
of
oaths
and
falsehoods
and
their
firm
belief
that
god
is
the
source
of
all
good
but
of
nothing
evil
of
their
love
of
virtue
they
give
proof
in
their
contempt
for
money
fame
and
pleasures
their
continence
easy
satisfying
of
their
wants
their
simplicity
modesty
their
love
of
man
is
proved
by
their
benevolence
and
equality
and
their
having
all
things
in
common
which
is
beyond
all
deception

reverence
and
take

was
also
at
one
time
a
member

the
essenian
brotherhood
furnishes
another
fragmentary
account
of
the
essenes
in
his
jewish
wars
of
which
the
following
is
the
substance
they
love
each
other
more
than
others
that
is
are
partial
to
the
household
of
faith
they
despise
riches
and
have
all
things
in
common
so
that
there
is
neither
abjectness
of
poverty
nor
distinction
of
riches
among
them
they
change
neither
garments
nor
shoes
till
they
are
worn
out
or
become
unfit
for
use
they
neither
buy
nor
sell
among
themselves
their
piety
is
extraordinary
they
never
speak
about
wordly
matters
before
sunrise
they
are
girt
about
with
a
linen
apron
and
have
a
baptism
of
cold
water
they
eat
but
one
kind
of
a
food
at
a
time
and
commence
with
a
prayer
and
the
priest
must
say
grace
before
any
one
eats
that
is
breaks
and
blesses
as
christ
did
they
also
return
thanks
after
eating
and
then
put
off
their
white
garments
strangers
were
made
welcome
at
their
tables
without
money
and
without
price

give
food
to
the
hungry
and
the
needy
and
show
mercy
to
all
they
curb
their
passions
restrain
their
anger

claim
to
be
ministers

regard
as
worse
than
perjury

as
follows
the
essenes
had
a
high
appreciations
of
the
inspired
law

to
become

taught
the
duty
of
mortifying
the
flesh
and
the
lusts
thereof

to
become
meek
and
lowly

avoided

the
heathen

in
numbers
about
four
thousand

strove

were
no
rich
and
poor
or
masters
and
servants
amongst
them
they
lived
peaceably
with
all
men
a
mysterious
silence
was
observed
while
eating
a
solemn
oath
was
required
on
becoming
a
member
of
the
secret
order
which
required
three
things
love
of
god
merciful
justice
to
all
men
and
to
avoid
the
wicked
and
help
the
righteous
purity
of
character
which
implied
love
of
truth
hatred
of
falsehood
and
strict
observance
of
mysteries

godliness

outsiders
that
is
and
publicans
they
endured
suffering
for
righteousness
sake
with
rejoicings
and
even
it
regarding
the
body
as
a
prison
for
the
soul
they
desired
the
time
to
come
to
escape
from
it
they
recognized
eight
different
stages
of
spiritual
growth
and
perfection
bodily
purity
celibacy
spiritual
purity
the
suppression
of
anger
and
malice
and
the
cultivation
of
a
meek
lowly

the
attainment
of
true
holiness

fit
temples
for
the
holy
ghost
the
ability
to
perform
miraculous
cures
and
raise
the
dead
becoming
forerunners
of
the
messiah
and
finally
they
took
a
solemn
vow
to
exercise
piety
toward
god
and
justice
toward
all
men
to
hate
the
wicked
assist
the
good
to
keep
clear
of
theft
and
unrighteous
gains
to
conceal
none

their
of
from
each
other
or
disclose
them

the
mystery

godliness

no
man

were
to
walk
humbly
with
god
shun
bad
society
forgive
their
enemies
sacrifice
their
passions
and
crucify
the
lusts
of
the
flesh
they
disregarded
bodily
suffering
and
even
gloried
in
martyrdom
preaching
and
singing
to
god
amid
their
sufferings

in
their
domestic
habits

filthy

food
consisted
of
bread

water
and
wild
roots

enjoined
their
duty
not

of
forgiving
their
enemies
but
of
seeking
to
benefit
them
and
of
even
blessing
the
destroyer
who
took
life

property
such
was
the
religion
such
the
moral
system
such
the
devout
piety

such
the
practical
lives

the
essenian
jews
a
religious
sect
which
flourished
in
alexandria

judea
several
hundred
years
before
the
birth
of
christ
and
went
out
of
history
the
hour
christianity
came
in
now
as
the
foregoing
exposition
shows
that
essenism
and
christianity
are
most
strikingly
alike
in
all
their
essential
features
that
the
former
system
contains
nearly
every
important
doctrine
and
precept
of
the
christian
religion
the
question
occurs
here
as
one
of
momentous
import
how
is
this
striking
resemblance
this
identity
of
character
of
the
two
religions
to
be
accounted
for
does
it
not
go
far
toward
proving
that
christianity
is
an
outgrowth
a
legitimate
offspring
of
judean
essenism
indeed
are
we
not
absolutely
driven
to
such
a
conclusion
let
us
briefly
recite
some
of
the
important
facts
brought
to
light
by
the
investigation
of
the
character
and
history
of
these
two
religions
and
see
if
those
facts
do
not
bring
them
together
and
weld
them
as
one
system
as
one
and
the
same
religion
both
are
alike
and
essenism
is
much
the
older
system
both
religions
are
an
outgrowth
of
judaism
both
were
known
and
taught
in
judea
and
in
alexandria
josephus
living
in
judea
and
philo
in
alexandria
neither
of
them
speaks
of
christianity
or
refers
to
any
such
religion
by
that
name
and
yet
both
describe
a
religion
inculcating
the
same
doctrines
and
moral
precepts
which
they
call
essenism
is
not
this
very
nearly
conclusive
proof
that
essenism
was
only
another
name
for
christianity
that
it
had
not
yet
changed
its
name
to
christianity
that
famous
standard
author
gibbon
was
evidently
of
this
opinion
when
he
said
whether
indeed
the
first
of
that
sect
the
essenes
took
the
name
of
christian
when
the
appellation
of
christian
had
as
yet
been
nowhere
announced
it
is
by
no
means
necessary
to
discuss
book
ii
chap
xvi
here
is
evidence
that
gibbon
believed
that
the
essenes
after
having
borne
that
name
for
centuries
changed
the
appellation
to
christian
and
we
find
still
stronger
language
than
this
in
the
writings
of
the
same
author
expressive
of
this
opinion
in
a
note
to
chapter
xv
he
says
it
is
probable
that
the
therapeuts
essenes
changed
their
name
to
christians
as
some
writers
affirm
and
adopted
some
new
articles
of
faith
here
the
position
is
assumed
that
the
christian
religion
is
an
outgrowth
of
essenism
that
is
merely
a
continuation
of
that
religion
under
a
change
of
name
with
a
slight
modification
of
its
creed
and
then
we
have
the
declaration
of
christian
writers
expressed
in
the
most
positive
terms
that
essenism
and
christianity
were
the
same
religion
the
former
name
being
used
at
an
earlier
period
hear
eusebius
a
standard
ecclesiastical
writer
of
the
fourth
century
he
asserts
positively
those
ancient
therapeuts
essenes
were
christians
and
their
ancient
writings
were
our
gospels
eccl
hist
p
hark
hark
my
good
christian
reader
here
is
one
of
your
own
sworn
witnessess
testifying
that
the
essenes
originated
and
established
the
christian
religion
the
religion
now
known
by
that
name
will
you
then
give
it
up
if
not
we
have
other
testimony
of
a
similar
character
rendering
the
proposition
still
stronger
robert
taylor
declares
the
learned
basnage
has
shown
that
the
essenes
were
really
christians
centuries
before
christ
and
that
they
were
actually
in
possession
of
those
very
writings
which
are
now
our
gospels
and
epistles
p
and
then
we
have
the
declaration
of
the
author
of
christ
the
spirit
no
that
the
christians
were
the
later
essenes
that
is
the
essenes
of
the
time
of
eusebius
under
a
changed
name
that
name
having
been
made
at
antioch
where
the
disciples
were
first
called
christian
the
same
writer
suggests
that
their
sacred
books
are
our
sacred
books
we
will
now
hear
eusebius
again
it
is
highly
probable
that
their
the
essenes
ancient
commentaries
which
philo
says
the
essenes
have
are
the
very
gospels
and
writings
of
the
apostles
based
upon
this
conclusion
he
calls
the
essenes
the
first
heralds
of
the
gospel
i
find
it
therefore
most
probable
says
weilting
that
jesus
and
john
belonged
literally
to
the
society
of
the
essenes
and
then
the
new
american
encyclopedia
furnishes
us
with
the
testimony
of
a
very
able
english
author
of
the
last
century
de
quincy
who
concurs
with
all
the
writers
cited
above
de
quincy
it
says
identified
the
essenes
as
being
the
early
christians
the
early
christians
were
known
as
essenes
such
testimony
coming
from
such
a
source
is
entitled
to
much
weight
vol
p
and
to
the
same
effect
is
the
testimony
of
bishop
marsh
who
admits
that
our
gospels
were
drawn
from
those
of
the
essenes
see
his
edition
of
translation
of
the
new
testament
thus
far
historical
we
will
now
lay
before
the
reader
some
historical
fraught
with
unanswerable
logical
potency
and
pointing
to
the
same
conclusion
it
is
a
fact
and
one
of
deep
logical
import
and
tending
to
corroborate
the
conclusion
of
some
of
the
writers
cited
above
who
tell
us
the
christian
gospels
were
first
composed
by
the
essenes
that
the
language
in
which
those
gospels
were
originally
written
was
greek
the
language
in
which
the
alexandrian
essenes
always
wrote
while
the
evangelical
writers
matthew
mark
luke
and
john
being
illiterate
fishermen
could
have
had
no
knowledge
of
any
but
the
jewish
their
own
at
least
it
is
susceptible
of
satisfactory
proof
that
they
never
wrote
in
any
other
language
hence
the
conclusion
is
irresistible
that
they
were
not
the
original
authors
of
the
gospels
the
works
of
several
authors
are
now
lying
at
our
elbow
who
express
the
conviction
unequivocally
that
the
gospels
were
copied
if
not
translated
from
older
writings
mr
le
clerc
one
of
the
ablest
writers
of
his
time
maintained
this
position
and
did
it
ably
another
writer
a
hatfield
was
awarded
a
prize
in
by
the
theological
faculty
of
gottingen
for
an
essay
in
which
the
position
was
ably
argued
that
matthew
mark
luke
and
john
were
not
the
authors
of
the
books
which
bear
their
names
but
were
mere
copyists
lessing
and
others
concur
with
him
in
this
conclusion
a
circumstance
confirming
this
verdict
is
found
in
the
fact
that
the
word
occurs
in
our
gospels
which
were
written
before
such
an
institution
was
established
by
those
who
were
then
called
christians
go
tell
it
to
the
church
matt
xviii
was
uttered
before
any
steps
had
been
taken
by
the
then
representatives
of
the
christian
faith
to
organize
such
a
body
an
evidence
this
that
he
alluded
to
the
church
of
the
essenes
as
there
were
no
other
churches
in
existence
at
the
time
which
leaves
the
inference
patent
and
irresistible
that
he
and
his
disciples
were
essenes
perhaps
then
under
the
changed
name
of
christians
centuries
prior
to
that
era
the
essenes
had
not
only
churches
but
their
whole
ecclesiastical
nomenclature
of
bishops
deacons
elders
priests
disciples
scriptures
gospels
epistles
psalms
hymns
mystery
allegory
if
christianity
was
in
the
days
of
christ
and
his
apostles
they
had
nothing
to
originate
either
with
respect
to
doctrines
precepts
church
polity
or
ecclesiastical
terms
all
being
established
for
them
centuries
before
that
era
with
these
facts
in
view
it
seems
impossible
that
the
two
religious
orders
essenes
and
christians
could
have
been
in
existence
at
the
same
time
as
separate
institutions
the
former
must
have
ended
when
the
latter
commenced
josephus
says
the
essenes
were
scattered
far
and
wide
and
were
in
every
city
being
quite
numerous
in
judea
in
his
time
but
he
makes
no
reference
to
any
sect
or
religious
order
by
the
title
of
christian
a
strong
inferential
evidence
upon
sound
priori
reasoning
that
christianity
as
yet
was
sailing
under
another
name
josephus
must
have
known
and
named
the
fact
had
there
been
a
christian
sect
or
disciple
there
bearing
that
name
impossible
otherwise
we
are
then
upon
the
logical
force
of
these
and
many
other
facts
driven
to
the
conclusion
that
christianity
began
when
essenism
ended
and
the
change
was
only
in
name
i
challenge
the
whole
christian
world
to
find
the
historical
proof
that
christianity
commenced
one
hour
before
the
termination
of
essenism
or
of
essenism
overlapping
the
christian
religion
so
far
as
to
survive
one
day
beyond
or
after
its
birth
i
will
confront
them
with
the
logic
of
dates
and
defy
them
to
find
any
proof
except
their
own
unauthorized
unauthenticated
and
fictitious
chronology
that
a
christian
was
ever
known
in
any
country
by
that
name
prior
to
the
time
of
tacitus
who
is
the
first
of
the
three
hundred
writers
of
that
era
that
makes
any
mention
of
christianity
christ
or
a
christian
this
was
long
after
josephus
time
which
accounts
most
satisfactory
for
his
omitting
any
allusion
to
christ
or
christianity
that
religion
had
not
yet
dropped
the
name
of
essenism
and
adopted
that
of
christianity
now
hard
indeed
must
distorted
reason
fight
the
ramparts
of
logic
and
history
to
resist
the
conviction
in
view
of
the
foregoing
facts
that
christianity
is
simply
an
outcropping
of
essenism
either
direct
or
through
budhism
and
even
if
it
were
possible
to
prove
that
the
two
religions
never
became
welded
together
yet
it
is
not
possible
to
disprove
the
striking
identity
of
their
doctrines
and
the
spirit
of
their
precepts
and
the
practical
lives
of
their
disciples
and
this
identity
coupled
with
the
fact
that
essenism
is
the
older
system
is
of
itself
most
superlatively
fatal
to
all
pretension
or
claim
to
originality
for
the
doctrines
of
the
christian
faith
it
is
a
matter
of
no
importance
whether
christianity
was
originally
known
by
another
name
so
long
as
it
can
be
shown
that
its
doctrines
had
all
been
preached
and
proclaimed
to
the
world
centuries
prior
to
the
date
assigned
for
its
origin
and
this
is
proved
by
the
long
list
of
paralellisms
presented
in
the
incipient
pages
of
this
chapter
and
this
proof
explodes
the
pretensions
of
christianity
to
an
original
divine
revelation
and
brings
it
down
to
a
level
with
pagan
orientalism
and
the
fact
that
it
sprang
up
in
a
country
where
its
doctrine
had
long
been
taught
by
pagans
and
orientalists
must
produce
the
conviction
deep
and
indelible
in
all
unbiased
minds
that
orientalism
was
the
mother
and
heathenism
the
father
of
the
christian
religion
even
in
the
absence
of
any
other
proof
in
fact
no
other
proof
can
be
needed
and
what
are
the
arguments
it
may
be
well
here
to
inquire
with
which
orthodox
christians
attempt
to
meet
combat
and
vanquish
the
overwhelming
mass
of
historical
facts
and
historical
testimonies
we
have
presented
in
preceding
pages
tending
to
prove
and
demonstrate
the
oriental
origin
of
their
religion
and
its
identity
with
essenism
their
whole
argument
is
comprised
in
the
naked
postulate
of
the
rev
paideaux
that
the
essenes
did
not
believe
in
the
resurrection
of
the
physical
body
but
believed
in
a
spiritual
resurrection
and
omit
from
their
creed
the
trinity
and
incarnation
doctrine
and
therefore
they
could
not
have
been
the
originators
of
the
christian
religion
but
this
argument
is
as
easily
demolished
as
a
cobweb
as
the
following
facts
will
prove
we
have
but
a
fragment
of
the
essenian
religion
but
one
end
of
their
creed
mere
scraps
furnished
us
by
philo
josephus
and
pliny
we
have
none
of
their
sacred
books
apart
from
the
christian
new
testament
they
had
secret
books
as
we
have
shown
in
which
doctrines
were
taught
which
they
regarded
as
sacred
to
be
thrown
before
the
as
pearls
before
swine
and
no
doctrines
were
regarded
as
more
sacred
or
secret
in
that
age
than
the
doctrines
of
the
trinity
and
incarnation
christ
injunction
see
thou
tell
no
man
was
probably
their
motto
which
prevented
the
publicity
of
a
portion
of
their
doctrines
and
as
their
sacred
books
containing
their
doctrines
perished
with
the
extinction
of
the
sect
except
those
now
found
in
the
christian
new
testament
a
full
knowledge
of
their
doctrines
therefore
never
reached
the
public
mind
all
religious
sects
had
secret
doctrines
designated
as
mysteries
of
godliness
including
the
principal
jewish
sects
and
the
earliest
christian
churches
it
is
therefore
highly
probable
that
if
we
were
in
possession
of
all
their
sacred
books
we
would
be
in
possession
of
the
proof
that
they
believed
and
taught
in
their
monasteries
the
doctrines
above
named
but
we
are
not
left
to
mere
inference
that
the
essenes
creed
did
include
the
doctrines
of
the
trinity
and
the
divine
incarnation
we
find
skeletons
of
these
doctrines
scattered
along
the
line
of
their
history
philo
himself
an
essene
teacher
most
distinctly
teaches
the
doctrine
of
the
incarnation
of
the
divine
word
or
logos
and
son
of
god
mediator
intercessor
and
messiah
were
familiar
words
with
him
the
idea
often
reappears
in
his
writings
that
the
word
could
become
flesh
that
the
son
of
god
could
appear
as
a
personality
and
return
to
the
bosom
of
the
father
moreover
one
writer
informs
us
that
the
essenes
celebrated
the
birth
and
death
of
a
divine
savior
as
a
mystery
of
godliness
and
they
claimed
in
their
earlier
history
to
be
forerunners
of
the
messiah
a
claim
which
would
soon
bring
a
messiah
before
the
world
that
is
lead
them
to
deify
and
worship
some
great
man
as
as
for
the
doctrine
of
the
trinity
we
have
the
authority
of
eusebius
that
they
taught
this
doctrine
too
so
that
it
is
not
true
that
they
did
not
recognize
these
two
prime
articles
of
the
christian
faith
the
incarnation
and
trinity
doctrines
some
modern
christians
assert
that
the
essenes
not
only
omitted
to
teach
these
doctrines
but
that
on
the
other
hand
they
taught
other
doctrines
not
taught
in
the
christian
new
testament
this
is
not
improbable
for
the
christian
religion
has
been
characterized
by
frequent
changes
in
its
doctrines
in
every
stage
of
its
practical
history
as
was
also
the
jewish
religion
which
preceded
it
and
from
which
it
emanated
judaism
is
a
perpetual
series
of
changes
it
changed
even
the
name
of
its
god
from
elohim
to
jehovah
its
leader
and
founder
abram
was
changed
to
abraham
and
his
grandson
and
successor
from
jacob
to
israel
and
we
have
the
works
of
many
christian
writers
in
our
possession
who
prove
by
their
own
bible
that
the
jews
made
many
changes
in
their
religious
polity
and
religious
doctrines
this
is
more
especially
observable
when
they
came
in
contact
with
nations
teaching
a
different
religion
their
whole
history
shows
they
were
prone
to
imitate
and
borrow
and
always
did
borrow
on
such
occasions
and
engraft
the
new
doctrines
thus
obtained
into
their
own
creed
and
thus
effected
important
changes
in
their
religion
we
have
the
authority
of
campbell
for
saying
the
jews
never
believed
and
taught
the
doctrine
of
future
punishment
and
other
doctrines
that
might
be
named
till
after
they
were
brought
in
contact
with
persians
in
babylon
who
had
long
taught
these
doctrines
see
dissertation
vi
and
enfield
declares
their
theological
opinions
underwent
thorough
changes
during
this
period
of
seventy
years
captivity
even
their
national
title
was
changed
at
one
period
from
israelites
to
jews
with
all
these
changes
of
names
titles
and
doctrines
in
view
it
is
not
incredible
that
one
of
the
jewish
sects
should
change
its
name
from
essenes
to
christians
and
with
this
change
modify
some
of
the
doctrines
and
more
especially
as
their
title
according
to
ginsburg
had
been
changed
before
from
chassidim
to
essenes
and
philo
at
one
period
calls
them
therapeuts
while
eusebius
says
the
therapeuts
were
christians
put
this
and
that
together
and
the
question
is
forever
settled
now
with
all
this
overwhelming
mass
of
historical
evidence
before
us
piled
mountain
high
tending
to
prove
the
truth
of
the
proposition
that
christianity
is
the
offspring
and
outgrowth
of
ancient
judean
essenism
we
feel
certain
that
no
sophistry
from
interested
charlatans
or
stereotyped
creed
worshipers
can
stave
off
or
obliterate
the
conviction
in
unprejudiced
minds
that
the
proposition
is
most
amply
proven
we
will
now
collate
christianity
with
another
ancient
religious
system
which
we
are
certain
it
will
not
be
disputed
after
the
comparison
is
critically
examined
contains
the
sum
total
of
the
doctrines
and
teachings
of
christianity

their

of
each
savior
was
miraculously
foretold
by
prophets
the
fallen
and
degenerate
condition
of
the
human
race
is
taught
in
the
religion
of
each
a
plan
of
restoration
or
salvation
is
provided
for
in
each
case
a
divine
savior
is
considered
necessary
in
both
cases
the
necessity
of
atoning
for
sin
is
taught
in
the
religion
of
each
a
god
or
son
of
god
is
selected
as
the
victim
for
the
atoning
sacrifice
in
each
case
this
god
is
sent
down
from
heaven
in
each
case
in
the
form
of
a
man
the
god
or
savior
in
each
case
is
the

of
the

chrishna
as
well
as
christ
was
held
to
be
really
god
incarnate
the
mission
of
each
savior
is
the
same
there
is
a
resemblance
in
and
christ
chrishna
as
well
as
christ
was
incarnated
and
born
of
a
woman
the
mother
in
each
case
was
a
holy
virgin
the
same
peculiarities
of
a
miraculous
conception
and
birth
are
related
of
each
each
had
an
adopted
earthly
father
the
father
of
chrishna
as
well
as
that
of
christ
was
a
carpenter
god
is
claimed
as
the
real
father
in
both
cases
a
spirit
or
ghost
was
the
author
of
the
conception
of
each
there
was
rejoicing
on
earth
when
each
savior
was
born
there
was
also
joy
in
heaven
at
the
birth
and
advent
of
each

was
of
royal
descent
their

were
born
on
the
of

at
birth
were
visited

in
each
case
the
rite
of
purification
observed
by
the
mothers
of
each
an
angel
warning
of
impending
danger
in
each
case
the
incumbent
ruler
was
hostile
in
each
case
a
bloody
decree
in
each
case
for
the
destruction
of
the
infant
savior
a
flight
of
the
parents
takes
place
in
both
cases
the
parents
of
one
sojourned
at
muturea

at
mathura

a
forerunner

to
himself

is
a
similarity

respective
religions

same
doctrines
are
propagated
by
the
disciples
of
each
the
doctrine
of
future
rewards

is
a
part
of
each
system
analogous
views
of
heaven
are
found
in
each
system
a
third
heaven
is
spoken
of
in
each
system
all
sin
must
be
punished
according
to
the

teachings
of
each
each
has
a
hell
provided
for
the
wicked
both
teach
a
hell
of
darkness
and
a
hell
of
light
an
immortal
worm
finds
employment
in
the
hell
of
each
system
the
worm
that
dieth
not
the
of
the
under
world
uses
brimstone
for
fuel
in
one
case
and
oil
in
the
other
the
motive
for
future
punishment
is
in
both
cases
the

each
has
a
purgatory
or
sort
of
house
special
divine
judgments
on
nations
are
taught
by

a
great
and
final
day
of

is
taught
by
each
a
general
resurrection
also
is
taught
in

religion
that
there
is
a
judge
of
the
dead
is
a
doctrine
of
each
two
witnesses
are
to
report
on
human
actions
in
the
final
assizes
we
are
furnished
in

case
with
the
dimension
of
heaven
or

holy
city

is
enjoined

and
repentance
for
sin
is
a
doctrine
taught
by
the
bible
of
each

has
a
prepared
city
for
a
paradise
the

both
teach
that
we
have
no
continuing
city
here
souls
are
carried
to
heaven
by
angels
as
in
the
instance
of
lazarus
in
each
case
a
belief
in
angels
or
spirits
is
a
tenant
of
each
religion
the
doctrine
of

angels
is
found
in

evil
man
can
neither
do
nor
speak
a
good
thing

teach
that

is
a
disadvantage
in
the
present
life
as
well
as
in
the
future
the
doctrine
of
free
will
or
free
agency
is
taught
by
each
predestination
seems
to
be
inferentially
taught
by
each
in
each
case
man
is
a
prize
in
a
lottery
with
god
and
the
devil
for
both
make
the
devil
or
devils
a
for
sin
both
teach
the
devil
or
evil
spirits
as
the
primary
cause
of
all
evil
the
destiny
of
both
body
and
soul
is
pointed
out
by
each
the
true
believers
are
known
as
saints

both
systems

with
white
robes
are
spoken
of
by
each
both

the
word
of
logos
as
god

as
god
by
the
holy
scriptures
of

both
teach
that
god
may
be
known
by
his
works
the
doctrine
of
one
supreme
god
is
taught
in
each
bible

and
truth
are
important
words
in
the
religious
nomenclature
of
each
both
profess
a
high
veneration
for
truth
where
the
treasure
is
there
is
the
heart
also
is
taught
by
each
seek
and
ye
shall
find
is
a
condition
prescribed
by
each
religious
toleration
is
a
virtue
professed
by
both
all
nations
are
professedly
based
on
an
equality
by
each
both
however
enjoin
partiality
to
the
household
of
faith
the
doors
of
salvation
are
thrown
open
to
high
and
low
rich
and
poor
by
each
each
professes
to
have
the
only
true
and
saving
faith
there
is
a
mystery
in
the
mission
of
each
savior
rama
is
a
well
known
word
in
the
bible
of
each
the
understanding
of
the
wise
is
a
phrase
in
each
both
speak
figuratively
of
the
blind
leading
the
blind
a
new
heaven
and
a
new
earth
is
spoken
of
by
each
the
doctrine
of
a
trinity
in
the
godhead
is
taught
by
each
baptism
by
water
is
a
tenant
and
ordinance
of
each
living
water
is
a
metaphor
found
in
each
baptism
by
fire
seems
also
to
be
recognized
by
each
fasting
is
emphatically
enjoined
by
each
sacrifices
are
of
secondary
importance
in
each
system
and
are
partially
or
wholly
abandoned
by
each
the
higher
law
is
paramount
to
ceremonies
in
each
religion
the
bible
of
each
religion
literally
condemns
idolatry
both
also
make
concessions
to
idolatry
polygamy
is
not
literally
encouraged
nor
openly
condemned
by
either
the
power
to
forgive
sins
is
conferred
on
the
disciples
of
each
the
doctrine
of
blasphemy
is
recognized
by
each
pantheism
or
the
reciprocal
of
god
in
nature
and
nature
in
god
is
taught
by
both
iii
bibles
and
holy
scriptures
each
has
a
bible
which
is
the
idolized
fountain
of
all
religious
teaching
both
have
an
old
testament
and
a
new
testament
virtually
the
new
testament
inaugurates
a
new
and
reform
system
of
religion
in
each
case
all
scripture
is
given
by
inspiration
of
god
is
the
faith
of
the
disciples
of
each
each
system
claimed
to
have
its
inspired
men
to
write
its
scriptures
both
hold
a
spiritual
qualification
necessary
to
understand
their
bibles
it
is
a
sin
to
become
wise
beyond
what
is
written
in
their
respective
bibles
both
recommend
knowing
the
scriptures
in
youth
alteration
of
their
respective
bibles
is
divinely
interdicted
the
bible
is
an
infallible
rule
of
faith
and
practice
in
both
cases
all
scripture
is
profitable
for
doctrine
is
the
faith
of
each
both
explain
away
the
errors
of
their
bibles
iv
spirituality
of
the
two
religions
the
religion
of
chrishna
is
spiritual
no
less
than
christ
both
teach
that
to
be
carnally
minded
is
death
external
rites
are
practically
dispensed
with
in
each
religion
the
spiritual
law
written
on
the
heart
is
recognized
by
each
god
is
within
you
budhists
teach
as
well
as
christians
both
recognize
an
invisible
spiritual
savior
god
dwells
in
the
heart
say
hindoo
as
well
as
christians
an
inward
recognition
of
the
divine
law
is
amply
seen
in
both
both
confess
allegiance
to
an
inward
monitor
the
doctrine
of
inspiration
and
internal
illumination
is
found
in
both
the
indwelling
comforter
is
believed
in
by
both
both
also
teach
that
religion
is
an
inward
work
both
speak
of
being
born
again
the
second
birth
a
spiritual
body
is
also
believed
in
by
both
spiritual
things
are
incomprehensible
to
the
natural
man
say
each
god
spiritually
sustaining
power
budhists
also
acknowledge
both
give
a
spiritual
interpretation
to
their
bibles
each
has
a
new
and
more
interior
law
superseding
the
old
law
the
spiritual
cross
or
asceticism
is
a
prominent
feature
of
each
religion
the
duty
of
renouncing
and
abandoning
the
external
world
is
solemnly
enjoined
by
each
budhists
renounce
the
world
more
practically
than
christians
withdrawal
or
seclusion
from
society
is
recommended
by
each
bodily
suffering
as
a
benefit
to
the
soul
is
encouraged
by
each
voluntary
suffering
for
righteousness
sake
is
a
virtue
with
each
the
cross
is
a
religious
emblem
in
each
system
both
glory
in
the
religion
of
the
cross
as
better
than
a
religion
without
suffering
hence
both
teach
the
greater
the
cross
the
greater
the
crown
earthly
pleasures
are
regarded
as
evil
by
both
contempt
for
the
body
as
an
enemy
to
the
soul
is
visible
in
both
retirement
for
religious
contemplation
is
a
duty
with
each
the
forsaking
of
relations
is
also
enjoined
by
each
spiritual
relationship
is
superior
to
external
relationship
with
both
to
die
is
great
gain
we
are
taught
by
each
a
subjugation
of
the
passions
is
a
religious
duty
with
each
the
road
to
heaven
is
a
narrow
one
with
each
the
same
state
of
religious
perfection
is
aspired
to
by
the
disciples
of
each
the
doctrine
of
faith
or
belief
faith
is
an
element
and
doctrine
with
each
heresy
or
want
of
faith
is
a
sin
of
great
magnitude
with
both
faith
in
the
savior
is
a
condition
to
salvation
by
both
confessing
the
savior
is
also
required
in
both
cases
believe
or
be
damned
is
the
condition
or
profess
to
believe
the
terrible
sine
qua
non
to
salvation
by
each
skeptics
or
unbelievers
are
with
both
the
chief
of
sinners
faith
can
remove
mountains
either
with
a
or
a
christian
both
contrast
faith
with
works

be
rejected
if

a
finality
in
matters

have
sprung
up

various
religious

have
sprung
up

conversion
from

religious
sect

is
common
to
both
both
religions
have
been
troubled
with
numerous
skeptics

both
both
in
ancient
times
suffered
much
persecution
the
disciples
of
both
have
suffered
death
without
flinching
from
the
faith
each
sent
numerous
missionaries
abroad
to
preach
and
convert
and
finally

cherished
the
hope
of
converting
the
world
to
their
religion
the

has
in

historical
quotations
to

parallels
he
has
all
the
historical
facts
on
which
they
were
constructed

drawn
from
the
sacred
books
of
the

works

writers
descriptive

may
be
published
in

also
in
proof
of
the
correctness
of
the
foregoing
comparative
analogies
we
will
now
summon
the
testimony
of
various
authors
setting
forth
the
historical
character
of
the
hindoo
god
chrishna
and
the
essential
nature
of
his
religion
so
far
as
it
approximates
in
its
doctrines
and
moral
teachings
to
the
christian
religion
we
will
first
hear
from
colonel
wiseman
for
ten
years
a
christian
missionary
in
india
there
is
one
indian
hindoo
legend
of
considerable
importance
says
this
writer
this
is
the
story
of
chrishna
the
indian
apollo
in
native
legends
he
is
represented
as
an
avatar
or
incarnation
of
the
divinity
at
his
birth
choirs
of
devitas
angels
sung
hymns
of
praise
while
shepherds
surrounded
his
cradle
it
was
necessary
to
conceal
his
birth
from
the
tyrant
ruler
cansa
to
whom
it
had
been
foretold
that
the
infant
savior
should
destroy
him
the
child
escaped
with
his
parents
beyond
the
coast
of
lamouna
for
a
time
he
lived
in
obscurity
and
then
commenced
a
public
life
distinguished
for
prowess
and
beneficence
he
washed
the
feet
of
the
brahmins
and
preached
the
most
excellent
doctrines
but
at
length
the
power
of
his
enemies
prevailed
before
dying
he
foretold
the
miseries
which
would
take
place
in
the
or
wicked
age
dark
age
of
the
world
chrishna
says
another
writer
taught
his
followers
that
they
alone
were
the
true
believers
of
the
saving
faith
throwing
down
the
barriers
of
caste
and
elevating
the
dogmas
of
their
faith
above
the
sacerdotal
class
he
admitted
every
one
who
felt
an
inward
desire
to
the
ministry
to
the
preaching
of
their
religion
a
system
thus
associating
itself
with
the
habits
feelings
and
personal
advantages
of
its

judson
at
the
moment
of
his
chrishna
conception
a
god
left
heaven
to
enter
the
womb
of
his
mother
a
virgin
immediately
after
his
birth
he
was
recognized
as
a
divine
personage
and
it
was
predicted
that
he
would
surpass
all
previous
divine
incarnations
in
holiness
every
one
adored
him
saluting
him
as
god
of
gods
when
twenty
years
of
age
he
went
into
a
desert
and
lived
there
in
the
austerest
retirement
poverty
simplicity
and
virtue
spending
his
whole
time
in
religious
contemplation
he
was
tempted
in
various
ways
but
his
resisted
all
the
seductive
approaches
of
sin
he
declared
is
my
essence
he
experienced
a
lively
opposition
from
the
priests
attached
to
the
ancient
creeds
as
christ
subsequently
did
but
he
triumphed
over
all
his
enemies
after
holding
a
discussion
with
them
as
christ
did
with
the
doctors
in
the
temple
he
revised
the
existing
code
of
morals
and
the
social
law
he
reduced
the
main
principles
of
morality
to
four
viz
aversion
to
cruelty
unbounded
sympathy
for
all
animated
beings
and
the
strictest
adherence
to
the
moral
he
also
gave
a
decalogue
of
commandments
viz
not
to
kill
not
to
steal
to
be
chaste
not
to
testify
falsely
not
to
lie
not
to
swear
to
avoid
all
impure
words
to
be
disinterested
not
to
take
revenge
and
not
to
be
superstitious
this
code
of
morals
was
firmly
established
in
the
hearts
of
his
followers
abridged
from
hardy
manual

budhism
it
was
prophesied
in
olden
times
that
a
person
would
arise
and
redeem

at
midnight
when
the

of
chrishna
was
taking
place
the

the

bowed
in

people
believed
he
was
a

they
eagerly
caught
the
words

fell
from

his

with
his
a
great
serpent
poisoned
the
river

caused
the
death
of
cows
and
when
they
drank
of
it
whom
chrishna
restored
to
life
by
a
look

power
his
life
was
devoted
to

he
left

from
pure
compassion
to

sinners
he
sought

lead
men
to
better
paths

consider
that

denounced

that
it
inculcated

all
that

of

is

to
constitute
the

of

more

half
the

how
striking
the
resemblance
the
doctrine
of
the
incarnation
the
descent
of
the
deity
upon
earth
and
his
manifestation
in
a
human
form
for
the
redemption
of
mankind
seems
to
have
existed
in
the
shape
of
prophecy
or
fact
in
all
ages
of
the
world
hindooism
teaches
nine
of
these
incarnations
furthermore
it
teaches
the
doctrine
of
the
trinity
the
fall
and
redemption
of
man
and
a
state
of
future
rewards
and
punishments
in
a
future

this
religion
in

of

is
traceable
to
remote
ages
the
doctrine
of
the

is
represented
in

and
taught
in
the

goes

now
we
ask
is
it
any
wonder
in
view
of
the
foregoing
historical
exposition
that
eusebius
should
exclaim
the
religion
of
jesus
christ
is
neither
new
nor
strange
eccl
hist
ch
iv
truly
did
augustine
say
this
in
our
day
is
the
christian
religion
not
as
having
been
unknown
in
former
times
but
as
having
recently
received
that
name
here
then
we
pause
to
ask
our
good
christian
reader
is
your
original
christianity
now
or
what
constitutes
the
revealed
religion
of
jesus
christ
or
where
is
the
evidence
that
any
new
religion
was
revealed
by
him
or
preached
by
him
seeing
we
have
all
his
religion
as
shown
by
the
foregoing
historical
citations
included
in
an
old
heathen
system
more
than
a
thousand
years
old
when
jesus
christ
was
born
we
find
it
all
here
in
this
old
oriental
system
of
budhism
essential
part
particle
and
of
it
we
find
christianity
all
here
its
alpha
and
omega
its
beginning
and
end
we
find
it
here
in
all
its
details
its
root
essence
and
entity
all
its
revealed
doctrines
religious
ideas
beautiful
truths
senseless
dogmas
and
oriental
phantoms
not
a
doctrine
principle
or
precept
of
the
christian
system
but
that
is
here
proclaimed
to
the
world
ages
before
the
angels
announced
the
birth
of
a
divine
babe
in
bethlehem
will
you
then
persist
in
claiming
that
truth
life
and
immortality
came
by
jesus
christ
and
that
christ
came
to
preach
a
new
gospel
to
the
world
and
to
set
forth
a
new
religion
never
before
heard
amongst
men
to
use
the
language
of
archbishop
tillotson
when
the
historical
facts
cited
in
this
work
demonstrate
a
hundred
times
over
that
such
a
position
is
palpably
erroneous
will
you
still
persist
with
all
those
undeniable
facts
staring
you
in
the
face
proving
and
reproving
with
overwhelming
demonstration
that
the
statement
is
untrue
in
declaring
that
the
religion
of
jesus
christ
is
the
only
true
and
religion
and
all
other
systems
are
mere
straw
stubble
tradition
and
superstition
as
asserted
by
a
popular
christian
writer
when
no
mathematician
ever
demonstrated
a
scientific
problem
more
clearly
than
we
have
proved
in
these
pages
that
all
the
principle
systems
of
the
past
by
no
means
excepting
christianity
are
essentially
alike
in
every
important
particular
all
of
their
cardinal
doctrines
being
the
same
differing
only
in
unimportant
details
seeing
then
that
all
systems
of
religion
have
been
found
to
be
essentially
alike
in
spirit
and
in
practice
the
question
arises
here
what
is
the
true
cause
assignable
for
this
striking
resemblance
how
is
it
to
be
accounted
for
perhaps
some
of
our
good
christian
readers
unacquainted
with
history
may
cherish
the
thought
that
all
the
oriental
systems
brought
to
notice
are
but
imitations
of
christianity
that
they
were
reconstructed
out
of
materials
obtained
from
that
source
that
christianity
is
the
parent
and
they
the
but
alas
for
their
idol
those
who
entertain
such
forlorn
hopes
are
sowing
to
the
wind
and
are
doomed
to
disappointment
with
the
exception
of
mahomedanism
alone
christianity
is
the
youngest
system
in
the
whole
catalogue
the
historical
facts
to
prove
this
statement
are
voluminous
but
as
it
needs
no
proof
to
those
who
have
read
religious
history
but
little
space
will
be
occupied
with
citations
for
this
purpose
with
respect
to
the
antiquity
of
the
principal
oriental
system
we
need
only
to
quote
the
testimony
of
sir
william
jones
a
devout
christian
writer
who
spent
years
in
india
and
whose
testimony
will
be
accepted
by
any
person
acquainted
with
his
history
he
makes
the
emphatic
declaration
that
the
name
of
chrishna
and
the
general
outline
of
his
history
were
long
anterior
to
the
birth
of
our
savior
and
probably
to
the
time
of
homer
we
know
very
certainly
asiat

no
about
it

very
and
being
a
scholar
a
traveler
and
a
sojourner
among
the
hindoos
and
well
versed
in
their
history
no
person
ever
had
a
better
opportunity
to
know
than
he
we
will
hear
this
renowned
author
further
in
the
sanscrit
dictionary
compiled
more
than
two
thousand
years
ago
we
have
the
whole
history
of
the
incarnate
deity
chrishna
born
of
a
virgin
and
miraculously
escaping
in
his
infancy
from
the
reigning
tyrant
of
his
country
cansa
he
passed
a
life
of
the
most
extraordinary
and
incomprehensible

birth

it

this
writer
also
states
that
the
first
christian
missionaries
who
entered
india
were
astonished
to
find
there
a
religion
so
near
like
their
own
and
could
only
account
for
it
by
supposing
that
the
devil
foreseeing
the
advent
of
christ
originated
a
system
of
religion
in
advance
of
his
and
just
like
it
stated
in
other
words
he
got
out
the
second
edition
of
the
gospel
plan
of
salvation
before
the
first
edition
was
published
or
had
an
existence
rather
a
smart
trick
this
thus
to
outwit
god
almighty
with
respect
to
the
vast
antiquity
of
the
hindoo
oriental
religion
which
indicates
it
as
being
not
only
the
source
from
which
the
materials
of
the
christian
religion
were
drawn
but
as
being
the
parent
of
all
the
leading
systems
with
their
three
thousand
subordinate
branches
which
existed
at
a
much
earlier
period
than
christianity
we
need
only
point
to
the
deep
chiseled
sculptures
and
imperishable
monuments
enstamped
on
their
temples
tombs
altars
vases
columns
pagodas
ruined
towers
which
with
contemporary
inscriptions
warrant
us
in
antedating
the
religion
of
the
himmalehas
far
beyond
the
authentic
records
of
any
other
religion
that
has
floated
down
to
us
on
the
stream
of
time
the
numerous
images
of
their
crucified
gods
chrishna
and
saki
emblazoned
on
their
old
rock
temples
in
various
parts
of
the
country
some
of
which
are
constructed
of
clay
porphyry
now
the
very
hardest
species
of
rock
with
their
attendant
inscriptions
in
a
language
so
very
ancient
as
to
be
lost
to
the
memory
of
man
vie
with
the
sanscrit
in
age
the
oldest
deciphered
language
in
the
world
all
these
and
a
hundred
corroboratory
historical
facts
fix
on
india
as
being
the
birthplace
of
the
mother
of
all
religions
now
existing
or
that
ever
had
an
existence
while
the
great
workshop
in
which
they
were
subsequently
remodeled
was
in
alexandria
in
egypt
whose
theological
schools
furnished
the
model
for
nearly
every
system
now
found
noticed
on
the
page
of
history
christianity
of
course
included
so
much
for
the
unrivaled
antiquity
of
the
hindoo
religion
now
the
more
important
query
arises
what
relationship
does
ancient
heathen
or
hindoo
budhism
bear
to
christianity
what
is
the
evidence
that
the
latter
is
an
outgrowth
of
the
former
as
an
answer
to
this
question
the
reader
will
please
note
the
following
facts
of
history
alexandria
the
home
of
the
world
great
conqueror
was
at
one
period
of
time
the
great
focal
center
for
religious
speculation
and
propagandism
the
great
emporium
for
religious
dogmas
throughout
the
east
and
a
place
of
resort
for
the
disciples
of
nearly
every
system
of
religious
faith
then
existing
in
this
capital
city
comprising
about
five
hundred
thousand
inhabitants
were
established
a
voluminous
library
and
vast
theological
schools
in
which
men
of
every
religious
order
and
of
every
phase
of
faith
met
and
exchanged
religious
ideas
and
borrowed
new
doctrines
with
which
they
remodeled
their
former
systems
of
faith
amounting
in
some
cases
to
an
entire
change
of
their
creeds
in
these
theological
schools
the
jewish
sect
which
afterward
became
the
founders
of
christianity
were
extensively
represented
for
let
it
be
noted
its
first
disciples
and
founders
had
all
been
jews
probably
of
the
essene
sect
for
a
long
time
the
christians
were
but
a
jewish
sect
says
reuss
history
of
christian
theology
alexander
had
previous
to
this
time
that
is
about
subjected
the
whole
of
western
asia
to
his
dominions
including
of
course
the
holy
land
judea
by
this
act
a
large
portion
of
the
jewish
nation
were
transferred
from
their
own
country
to
alexandria
and
this
number
was
afterward
vastly
increased
by
alexander
successor
ptolemy
sotor
who
carried
off
and
settled
in
that
credal
city
one
hundred
thousand
more
jews
as
the
result
in
part
of
these
repeated
calamities
the
chosen
people
were
literally
broken
up
they
lost
their
law
lost
their
leader
and
lawgiver
lost
their
language
lost
the
control
of
their
country
the
land
which
they
verily
believed
the
lord
had
deeded
to
them
fee
and
ratified
in
the
high
court
of
heaven
and
had
declared
they
should
hold
and
possess
forever
and
finally
they
partially
lost
their
nationality
being
literally
dissolved
and
broken
up
and
were
finally
almost
lost
to
history
the
ten
tribes
disappearing
entirely
the
jews
had
ever
manifested
a
proneness
for
copying
after
the
religious
customs
of
their
heathen
neighbors
and
engrafting
their
doctrines
into
their
own
creeds
as
their
bible
history
furnishes
ample
proof
in
alexandria
a
very
superior
opportunity
was
afforded
for
doing
this
excelling
in
this
respect
any
previous
period
of
their
history
the
shattered
condition
of
their
own
religion
with
all
its
conventional
creeds
customs
and
ceremonies
now
suspended
and
literally
prostrated
as
above
shown
vastly
augmented
the
temptation
ever
rife
with
them
to
make
another
change
in
their
religion
and
subject
their
creed
to
another
installment
of
new
doctrines
by
which
it
became
christianity
the
liberal
character
and
tolerant
spirit
of
the
political
and
religious
institutions
of
the
kingdom
of
alexandria
with
its
vast
and
attractive
library
of
two
hundred
thousand
volumes
established
principally
by
ptolemy
with
other
attractive
features
already
pointed
out
furnished
great
facilities
as
well
as
increased
temptations
to
religious
propagandists
to
absorb
new
theories
and
make
new
creeds
out
of
the
vast
medley
of
religious
doctrines
and
speculative
dogmas
preached
and
propagated
in
that
royal
city
by
the
disciples
and
representatives
of
nearly
every
religious
system
then
in
existence
brought
together
by
the
attractions
above
specified
hence
every
consideration
would
lead
us
to
conclude
taken
in
connection
with
the
facts
above
stated
and
the
borrowing
proclivity
and
imitative
propensity
of
the
jews
that
they
would
not
and
could
not
withstand
the
overweening
and
overpowering
temptation
to
make
another
radical
change
in
their
religion
by
a
new
draught
on
the
boundless
reservoir
of
speculative
ideas
religious
tenets
and
specious
theories
then
glowing
in
the
popular
schools
of
alexandria
all
the
facts
above
enumerated
would
impel
us
to
the
conclusion
that
the
jews
would
and
every
page
of
history
touching
the
matter
proves
they
did
make
important
changes
in
their
religion
by
this
contact
with
the
oriental
systems
as
they
had
repeatedly
done
before
some
of
this
proof
we
will
here
present
to
show
how
they
originated
christianity
the
schools
of
alexandria
says
enfield
a
christian
writer
by
pretending
to
teach
sublime
doctrines
concerning
god
and
divine
things
enticed
men
of
different
countries
and
religions
and
among
the
rest
the
jews
to
study
its
mysteries
and
incorporate
them
with
their
own
the
jewish
faith
mixed
with
the
pythagorean
and
afterward
with
the
egyptian
oriental
theology
that
is
they
became
essenes
in
the
grecian
school
of
pythagoras
who
taught
the
doctrines
of
that
religious
order
then
in
the
egyptian
schools
of
alexandria
and
finally
with
christ
as
their
leader
who
taught
the
doctrines
of
both
schools
they
being
essentially
alike
they
assumed
the
name
of
christian
in
honor
of
him
and
thus
is
christianity
from
essene
budhism
beers
in
his
history
of
the
jews
sustains
the
above
statement
by
the
declaration
that
the
essenian
jews
fled
to
egypt
at
the
time
of
the
babylonian
captivity
and
there
became
acquainted
with
the
pythagorean
philosophy
and
ingrafted
it
upon
the
religion
of
moses
which
would
make
them
essenian
budhists
for
cunningham
assures
us
that
the
doctrine
of
pythagoras
were
intensely
budhistic
philsa
topus
chap
x
we
will
condense
a
few
more
historical
testimonies
relative
to
the
entire
change
of
the
jewish
faith
while
in
alexandria
as
well
as
on
other
occasions
to
show
how
easy
and
natural
it
was
for
that
portion
of
the
jews
who
afterward
became
the
founders
of
christianity
to
slide
into
and
adopt
essenian
budhism
whose
doctrines
they
took
to
constitute
the
christian
religion
gibbon
chap
xxi
declares
that
the
theological
opinions
of
the
jews
underwent
great
changes
by
their
contact
with
the
various
foreigners
they
found
in
alexandria
tytler
likewise
in
his
universal
history
assures
us
that
the
jewish
religion
became
changed
by
the
intermixture
of
heathen
campbell
also
testifies
that
their
views
came
pretty
much
to
coincide
with
those
of
the
pagans
see
his
dissertation
vi
and
the
author
of
for
complains
that
the
pagan
theology
stole
upon
them
from
every
quarter
and
mingled
in
all
the
views
of
the
then
known
tribes
so
that
by
the
year
it
had
wrought
visible
changes
in
their
notions
and
habits
of
thought
p
here
we
have
the
proof
that
the
whole
jewish
religion
underwent
a
change
in
alexandria
now
most
certainly
a
nation
or
sect
professing
a
religion
so
easily
changed
and
possessing
a
character
so
fickle
or
so
irrepressible
as
to
yield
on
every
slight
occasion
and
embrace
every
opportunity
to
imbibe
new
religious
ideas
and
doctrines
would
easily
if
not
naturally
slide
into
the
adoption
of
the
religious
system
then
promulgated
in
alexandria
under
the
name
of
budhism
and
afterward
remodeled
or
transformed
and
called
christianity
the
jews
of
the
essenian
order
as
we
have
in
part
shown
in
a
previous
chapter
set
forth
in
their
creed
all
the
leading
doctrines
now
comprised
in
the
christian
religion
hundreds
of
years
before
the
advent
of
christ
not
excepting
the
doctrine
of
the
divine
incarnation
and
its
adjuncts
as
these
concomitants
of
the
present
popular
faith
we
will
now
prove
were
not
unknown
to
the
jewish
theology
but
constituted
a
part
of
the
religion
of
some
of
the
principal
jewish
sects
that
standard
christian
author
milman
in
his
history
of
christianity
tells
us
that
the
doctrine
of
the
incarnation
manifest
in
the
flesh
was
the
doctrine
from
the
ganges
and
even
the
shores
of
the
yellow
sea
to
the
ilissus
it
was
the
fundamental
principle
of
the
indian
budhist
religion
and
philosophy
it
was
the
basis
of
zoroasterism
it
was
pure
platonism
it
was
platonic
judaism
in
the
alexandrian
school
here
it
is
positively
declared
by
a
popular
christian
writer
whose
work
is
a
part
of
nearly
every
popular
library
in
christiandom
as
a
standard
authority
that
the
appearance
of
god
amongst
men
in
the
human
form
by
human
birth
was
a
doctrine
of
the
jewish
religion
in
some
of
its
branches
especially
the
essenian
branch
further
proof
that
christianity
originated
nothing
and
gave
utterance
to
no
new
doctrine
or
precepts
and
performed
no
new
miracles
where
then
is
the
claim
for
its
originality
on
what
ground
is
it
predicated
please
answer
us
good
christian
brother
it
is
a
question
of
no
importance
if
it
could
be
settled
whether
christianity
is
a
direct
outgrowth
from
one
of
the
sects
of
judaism
or
whether
it
derived
a
portion
of
its
doctrines
from
this
source
and
the
balance
from
ascetic
budhism
yet
we
regard
it
as
an
incontrovertible
proposition
that
it
all
grew
out
of
budhism
originally
either
directly
or
indirectly
christ
may
have
received
his
doctrines
secondhanded
all
or
a
portion
from
the
essenian
jews
for
that
sect
held
all
the
leading
doctrines
of
budhism
as
we
have
shown
in
a
previous
chapter
which
now
goes
under
the
name
of
the
religion
of
jesus
christ
or
we
may
indulge
the
not
unreasonable
hypothesis
that
the
founders
of
christianity
who
republished
the
doctrines
of
budhism
and
adopted
them
as
their
own
received
them
all
direct
from
the
disciples
of
that
religious
order
for
they
were
everywhere
as
one
writer
taylor
declares
speaking
of
their
extensive
travels
to
propagate
their
doctrines
through
the
world
and
it
was
about
that
period
as
goodrich
informs
us
they
sent
out
nine
hundred
missionaries
who
made
six
millions
of
converts
a
small
fraction
of
their
present
number
three
hundred
and
eighty
millions
as
given
by
some
of
our
geographies
one
third
more
than
the
entire
census
of
christendom
and
six
times
the
number
of
believers
in
the
christian
religion
if
we
omit
greeks
and
catholics
it
is
as
a
writer
remarks
the
oldest
and
most
widely
spread
religion
in
the
world
and
whatever
hypothesis
may
be
adduced
to
account
for
the
fact
christianity
is
now
all
budhism
it
is
impossible
with
the
historic
darkness
which
at
present
environs
and
beclouds
our
pathway
to
determine
at
what
period
or
in
what
manner
christ
became
an
essene
whether
he
was
born
of
essenian
parents
or
became
a
convert
to
the
faith
because
the
whole
period
of
his
life
with
the
exception
of
about
three
years
is
a
total
blank
in
history
there
is
but
one
incident
related
of
his
movements
by
his
bible
biographers
prior
to
his
year
leaving
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
century
of
his
probably
active
life
unreported
a
period
that
may
have
witnessed
several
important
changes
in
his
religion
we
have
not
even
his
ancestry
reported
in
his
scriptural
biography
in
either
parental
line
unless
we
assume
joseph
to
have
been
his
father
the
parental
lineage
of
his
mother
is
entirely
omitted
had
we
his
line
of
ancestry
or
could
we
trace
him
back
to
his
national
or
family
origin
we
doubt
not
but
we
should
there
find
a
clue
to
the
origin
of
his
religion
we
should
find
his
ancestors
were
essenian
jews
nor
can
we
fix
the
date
when
essenian
budhism
among
the
jews
received
the
name
of
christianity
for
a
similar
reason
there
is
a
link
a
chain
of
events
of
four
hundred
years
left
out
of
the
bible
between
judaism
and
christianity
thus
lacking
four
hundred
years
of
connecting
the
two
religions
together
or
of
showing
how
the
latter
grew
out
of
the
former
malachi
the
last
book
of
the
old
testament
antedates
the
first
events
of
christian
history
four
centuries
or
twelve
generations
thus
leaving
a
wide
and
dark
gap
between
them
and
besides
we
can
not
find
the
name
of
christ
or
christianity
mentioned
in
any
of
the
contemporary
histories
of
that
era
till
one
hundred
and
four
years
after
the
time
fixed
for
christ
birth
by
christendom
tacitus
being
the
first
writer
who
names
either
and
this
was
at
that
date
these
facts
disclose
the
whole
secret
with
respect
to
the
mystery
and
darkness
thrown
around
the
origin
of
the
christian
religion
the
how
the
when
and
the
where
of
its
origin
that
chapter
of
christian
history
is
left
out
of
the
record
the
bible
account
itself
is
but
fragmentary
as
it
leaves
nine
tenths
of
christ
history
a
blank
years
out
of
the
thirty
and
omits
all
mention
of
his
ancestors
beyond
his
grandmother
and
leaves
even
the
time
of
his
birth
a
blank
the
researches
of
the
learned
says
mosheim
a
standard
christian
author
though
long
and
ably
conducted
have
been
unable
to
fix
the
time
of
christ
birth
with
certainty
eccl
hist
p
wonderful
admission
truly
as
it
is
an
evidence
that
nothing
else
can
be
fixed
with
certainty
with
respect
to
the
history
of
the
man
christ
jesus
only
that
his
doctrines
and
precepts
were
all
borrowed
perhaps
during
the
dark
and
mysteries
years
of
his
life
if
not
an
essene
by
birth
there
is
no
escaping
the
conclusion
that
christianity
is
a
an
outgrowth
and
remodeling
of
budhism
with
a
change
of
name
only
a
thousand
facts
of
history
prove
and
proclaim
it
and
the
verdict
of
posterity
will
be
unanimous
in
affirming
it
from
the
almost
endless
chain
of
analogies
exhibiting
a
striking
resemblance
even
in
their
minute
details
of
christianity
and
budhism
we
are
compelled
to
conclude
that
one
furnished
the
materials
for
the
other
that
one
is
the
offspring
the
legitimate
child
of
the
other
and
as
it
is
a
settled
historical
fact
that
budhism
is
much
the
older
system
there
is
hence
no
difficulty
in
determining
which
is
the
parent
and
which
is
the
child
in
the
hindoo
story
of
the
creation
of
the
human
race
we
find
adimo
and
heva
given
as
the
names
of
the
first
man
and
woman
answering
to
our
adam
and
eve
and
our
shem
ham
and
japheth
are
traceable
to
their
sherma
hama
and
jiapheta
the
difference
in
the
mode
of
spelling
is
probably
owing
to
the
difference
in
the
languages
and
under
the
new
era
we
have
christ
jesus
answering
to
their
chrishna
zeus
as
some
writers
give
the
name
of
the
eighth
avatar
and
for
maia
a
godmother
we
have
mary
and
other
similar
analogies
might
be
pointed
out
besides
the
long
string
of
strikingly
similar
events
previously
presented
in
the
history
of
the
two
saviors
christ
and
chrishna
amounting
to
hundreds
such
an
almost
countless
list
of
similar
and
nearly
identical
incidents
bids
defiance
and
absolutely
sets
at
naught
all
attempts
to
account
for
it
as
a
mere
fortuitous
accident
there
is
no
other
explanation
possible
but
that
christianity
is
a
or
of
budhism
here
let
it
be
noted
that
christianity
was
not
the
only
religion
which
was
rehabilitated
in
the
alexandrian
schools
on
the
contrary
all
the
popular
oriental
systems
then
in
active
being
had
long
previously
passed
through
the
same
representative
theological
schools
and
institutions
of
that
royal
and
commercial
city
all
were
remodeled
in
its
theological
workshops
a
fact
which
accounts
most
conclusively
for
the
same
train
of
religions
ideas
and
historical
incidents
being
found
in
the
later
sacred
books
of
each
and
besides
sir
william
jones
says
the
disciples
of
these
various
systems
of
religion
had
intercourse
with
each
other
long
before
the
time
of
christ
which
would
necessarily
bring
about
a
uniformity
in
the
doctrines
and
general
character
of
each
system
the
disciples
of
all
the
religious
systems
cited
their
initiatory
miracles
as
a
proof
of
being
on
familiar
terms
with
god
almighty
they
all
as
is
claimed
healed
the
sick
all
restored
the
deaf
the
dumb
and
the
blind
all
cast
out
devils
and
all
raised
the
dead
see
chapter
on
parallels
in
fact
all
their
miracles
and
legendary
marvels
run
in
parallel
lines
because
all
were
recast
in
the
same
in
alexandria
a
coincidence
is
thus
beautifully
explained
which
would
otherwise
be
hard
to
account
for
gibbon
says
it
was
in
the
school
of
alexandria
that
the
christian
theology
appears
to
have
assumed
a
regular
and
scientific
form
decline
chap
xv
that
is
the
regular
and
scientific
form
of
budhism
or
essenism
pregnant
with
meaning
is
the
text
it
was
in
the
city
of
antioch
the
disciples
were
first
called
christians
acts
xi
here
is
conclusive
proof
that
the
disciples
of
the
christian
faith
were
not
always
known
by
the
same
name
and
were
not
at
first
called
christians
then
what
were
they
called
during
the
earlier
years
of
their
history
here
is
a
great
and
important
query
and
one
involving
a
momentous
problem
couple
the
two
facts
together
that
the
disciples
were
first
known
as
christians
at
antioch
and
that
the
essenian
order
of
believers
expired
and
went
out
of
history
about
that
period
and
the
question
is
at
once
and
forever
satisfactorily
settled
it
was
not
an
infrequent
act
on
making
important
changes
in
a
religion
and
adopting
some
new
items
of
faith
to
change
the
title
of
the
system
and
give
it
a
new
name
after
alexander
campbell
had
made
some
modifications
in
his
previous
religious
faith
and
started
a
new
church
his
followers
were
popularly
called
campbellites
elias
hicks
ingrafted
some
reform
ideas
into
the
quaker
faith
and
instituted
a
new
society
of
that
order
hence
and
henceforth
his
disciples
were
known
as
hicksites
in
like
manner
jesus
christ
having
made
some
innovations
in
his
inherited
jewish
faith
which
was
of
the
essene
stamp
by
ingrafting
more
of
the
budhist
doctrine
into
it
his
followers
were
henceforth
called
christians
how
complete
the
analogy
here
let
it
be
borne
in
mind
as
powerfully
confirmatory
of
this
conclusion
that
the
first
christians
were
as
history
affirms
merely
reformatory
jews
the
twelve
chosen
were
all
jews
probably
of
the
essene
order
according
to
the
rev
prideaux
jewish
history
the
jews
of
this
order
were
first
called
israelites
in
common
with
the
other
tribes
then
chassidim
and
thirdly
essenes
and
finally
after
the
essenian
jesus
christ
with
some
new
radical
ideas
proclaimed
ye
have
heard
it
hath
been
said
by
them
of
old
time
thus
and
so
but
i
say
unto
you
differently
the
title
was
again
changed
and
they
adopted
or
received
the
name
of
christians
the
essenes
going
out
of
history
at
the
very
date
christians
first
appear
in
history
put
this
and
that
together
and
the
chain
is
welded
thus
we
can
as
easily
trace
the
origin
of
christianity
as
we
can
trace
the
origin
of
a
root
running
beneath
the
soil
in
the
direction
of
a
certain
tree
history
then
proclaims
that
to
the
honest
pious
yet
ignorant
slothful
and
filthy
budhistic
essenes
must
be
awarded
the
honor
or
dishonor
of
giving
birth
to
that
system
of
religion
now
known
as
christianity
chrishna
as
a
god
additional

the

life
and

or
jeseus
christna
as
styled
by
one
writer
are
drawn
mostly
from
the
vedas
baghavat
gita
bible
in
india
virgin
mother
her
the
holy
book
declares
that
through
her
the
designs
of
god
were
accomplished
she
was
pure
and
chaste
no
animal
food
ever
touched
her
lips
honey
and
milk
were
her
sustenance
her
time
was
spent
in
solitude
lost
in
the
contemplation
of
god
who
showered
upon
her
innumerable
blessings
she
looked
upon
death
as
the
birth
to
a
new
and
better
life
when
she
traveled
a
column
of
fire
in
the
heavens
went
before
her
to
guide
her
one
evening
as
she
was
praying
she
heard
celestial
music
and
fell
into
a
profound
ecstasy
and
being
overshadowed
by
the
spirit
of
god
she
conceived
the
god
chrishna
baghavat
gita
his
life
and
this
god
was
about
sixteen
when
he
commenced
active
life
like
christ
he
chose
twelve
disciples
to
aid
him
in
propagating
his
doctrines
he
spent
his
time
working
miracles
resuscitating
the
dead
healing
lepers
restoring
the
deaf
and
the
blind
defending
the
weak
against
the
strong
and
the
oppressed
against
the
oppressor
and
in
proclaiming
his
divine
mission
to
redeem
man
from
original
sin
and
banish
evil
and
restore
the
reign
of
good
baghavat
gita
it
is
declared
that
he
came
to
teach
peace
charity
love
to
man
the
practice
of
good
for
its
own
sake
and
faith
in
the
inexhaustible
goodness
of
the
creator
also
to
preach
the
immortality
of
the
soul
and
the
doctrine
of
future
rewards
and
punishments
and
to
vanquish
the
prince
of
darkness
rakshas
it
is
further
declared
that
brahma
sent
his
son
chrishna
upon
the
earth
to
die
for
the
salvation
of
man
his
lofty
precepts
and
the
purity
of
his
life
spread
his
fame
throughout
all
india
and
finally
won
for
him
more
than
three
millions
of
followers
he
inculcated
the
sublimest
doctrines
and
the
purest
morals
and
the
grand
principles
of
charity
and
he
forbade
revenge
and
commanded
to
return
good
for
evil
and
consoled
the
feeble
and
the
unhappy
he
lived
poor
and
loved
the
poor
he
lived
chaste
and
enjoined
chastity
problems
the
most
lofty
and
morals
the
most
pure
and
sublime
and
the
future
destiny
of
man
were
themes
which
engaged
his
most
profound
attention
chrishna
we
will
venture
to
say
says
the
bible
in
india
was
the
greatest
of
philosophers
not
only
of
india
but
of
the
entire
world
he
was
the
grandest
moral
figure
of
ancient
times
bible
in
india
chrishna
was
a
moralist
and
a
philosopher
we
should
admire
his
moral
lessons
so
sublime
and
so
pure
he
was
recognized
as
the
word
he
received
the
title
of
jeseus
which
means
pure
essense
chrishna
signifies
the
promised
of
god
the
messiah
when
he
preached
he
often
spoke
from
a
mount
he
also
spoke
in
parables
plays
a
great
part
in
the
familiar
instructions
of
this
hindoo
redeemer
he
relates
a
very
interesting
parable
of
a
fisherman
who
was
much
persecuted
by
his
neighbors
but
who
in
the
time
of
a
severe
famine
when
the
people
were
suffering
and
dying
for
the
want
of
food
being
so
noble
as
to
return
good
for
evil
he
carried
food
to
these
same
persecuting
enemies
and
thus
saved
them
from
starvation
therefore
said
he
do
good
to
all
both
the
evil
and
the
good
even
your
enemies
his
addresses
to
the
people
were
simple
but
to
his
disciples
they
were
elevated
and
philosophical
such
was
the
wisdom
of
his
sermons
and
his
parables
that
the
people
crowded
around
him
eager
to
behold
and
hear
him
saying
this
is
indeed
the
redeemer
promised
to
our
fathers
great
multitudes
followed
him
exclaiming
this
is
he
who
resuscitates
the
dead
and
heals
the
lame
and
the
deaf
and
the
blind
on
one
occasion
as
he
entered
madura
as
christ
once
entered
jerusalem
the
people
came
out
in
flocks
to
meet
him
and
strewed
branches
in
his
way
on
another
occasion
two
women
approached
him
anointed
him
with
oil
and
worshiped
him
when
the
people
murmured
at
this
waste
he
replied
better
is
a
little
given
with
an
humble
heart
than
much
given
with
ostentation
such
was
his
sense
of
decorum
that
he
admonished
some
girls
he
once
observed
playing
in
a
state
of
nudity
on
the
bank
of
a
river
after
bathing
they
repented
asked
his
forgiveness
and
reformed
the
followers
of
chrishna
practiced
all
the
virtues
and
observed
a
complete
abnegation
of
self
and
lived
poor
hoping
for
a
reward
in
the
future
life
they
occupied
all
their
time
in
the
service
of
their
divine
master
pure
and
majestic
was
their
worship
chrishna
had
a
favorite
disciple
who
sustained
to
him
the
relation
of
john
to
christ
while
angada
acted
the
part
of
judas
by
following
him
to
the
ganges
and
betraying
him
last
when
chrishna
knew
his
hour
had
come
forbidding
his
disciples
to
follow
him
he
repaired
to
the
bank
of
the
river
ganges
and
having
performed
three
ablutions
he
knelt
down
and
looking
up
to
heaven
he
prayed
to
brahma
while
nailed
to
the
cross
the
tree
on
which
he
was
suspended
became
suddenly
covered
with
great
red
flowers
which
diffused
their
fragrance
all
around
and
it
is
said
he
often
appeared
to
his
disciples
after
his
death
in
all
his
divine
majesty
second
advent
of
there
is
not
a
hindoo
or
a
brahmin
who
does
not
look
upon
the
second
coming
of
chrishna
as
an
established
article
of
faith
their
holy
bibles
the
vedas
and
gita
prophesy
of
him
thus
he
shall
come
crowned
with
lights
he
shall
come
and
the
heavens
and
the
earth
shall
be
joyous
the
stars
shall
pale
before
his
splendor
the
earth
will
be
too
small
to
contain
him
for
he
is
infinite
he
is
almighty
he
is
wisdom
he
is
beauty
he
is
all
and
in
all
and
all
men
all
animated
beings
beasts
birds
trees
and
plants
will
chant
his
praises
he
will
regenerate
all
bodies
and
purify
all
souls
he
will
be
as
sweet
as
honey
and
ambrosia
and
as
pure
as
the
lamb
without
spot
or
as
the
lips
of
a
virgin
all
hearts
will
be
transported
with
joy
from
the
rising
to
the
setting
of
the
sun
it
will
be
a
day
of
joy
and
exultation
when
this
god
shall
manifest
his
power
and
his
glory
and
reconcile
the
world
unto
himself
such
are
a
few
of
the
prophetic
utterances
of
his
devout
and
prayerful
disciples
we
find
says
a
writer
in
all
the
theogonies
of
different
countries
the
hope
of
the
advent
of
a
god
either
his
first
or
his
second
coming
a
hope
which
sprang
from
a
sense
of
their
own
imperfections
and
sufferings
which
naturally
induced
them
to
look
for
a
divine
redeemer
of
numerous
are
the
prescriptive
admonitions
found
in
the
holy
books
which
set
forth
the
religion
of
this
heathen
demigod
so
called
by
christian
professors
they
appertain
to
all
the
duties
of
life
but
are
too
numerous
to
be
quoted
here
those
appertaining
to
woman
enjoin
the
most
sacred
regard
for
her
rights
such
as
woman
should
be
protected
with
tenderness
and
shielded
with
fostering
solicitude
there
is
no
crime
more
odious
than
to
persecute
woman
or
take
advantage
of
her
weakness
degrade
woman
and
you
degrade
man
for
other
similar
precepts
see
chapter
xxxii
the
injunctions
to
read
their
holy
bible
the
vedas
are
quite
numerous
such
as
let
him
study
the
holy
scriptures
unceasingly
pray
night
and
morning
and
read
the
holy
scriptures
in
the
attitude
of
devotion
and
many
of
them
read
it
through
upon
their
knees
see
chap
xliv
we
have
not
space
for
a
further
exposition
of
this
subject
here
but
it
will
be
found
more
fully
set
forth
in
the
pamphlet
christ
and
chrishna
compared
which
will
perhaps
become
an
appendix
to
this
work
it
may
be
objected
that
there
are
precepts
and
stories
to
be
found
in
the
religion
of
this
hindoo
god
chrishna
which
reflect
but
little
credit
or
honor
upon
that
religion
this
is
true
and
similar
reflections
would
materially
damage
the
religion
of
christianity
also
the
story
of
christ
beating
and
maltreating
the
in
the
temple
his
cursing
an
innocent
unoffending
and
unconscious
fig
tree
and
his
indulgence
in
profane
swearing
at
his
enemies
o
ye
fools
and
blind
ye
generation
of
vipers
how
can
you
escape
the
damnation
of
hell
does
not
reflect
any
credit
upon
his
religion
viewed
as
a
system
defects
then
may
be
found
in
both
systems
in
viewing
the
analogies
of
the
two
religions
it
should
be
noted
that
the
hindoos
claim
with
a
forcible
show
of
facts
and
logic
that
the
religion
of
christianity
grew
out
of
theirs
it
has
not
been
long
since
a
learned
hindoo
maintained
this
position
in
a
public
debate
with
a
missionary
if
all
these
facts
effect
nothing
in
the
way
of
inducing
the
christian
clergy
to
confess
the
falsity
of
their
position
in
claiming
their
religion
to
be
a
direct
emanation
from
god
it
will
be
a
sad
commentary
upon
either
their
intelligence
or
their
honesty
these
historical
facts
with
those
set
forth
in
the
preceding
chapters
prove
that
the
religion
called
christianity
instead
of
being
as
christians
claim
the
product
of
the
divine
mind
is
the
product
of
heathen
minds
a
spontaneous
outgrowth
of
the
moral
and
religious
elements
of
the
human
mind
and
therefore
for
god
to
have
revealed
it
over
again
to
the
founders
of
christianity
would
have
been
superfluous
and
a
proof
of
his
ignorance
of
history
the
author
deems
it
proper
to
state
here
with
respect
to
the
comparison
between
christ
and
chrishna
that
some
of
the
doctrines
which
he
has
selected
as
constituting
a
part
of
the
religion
of
the
hindoo
savior
are
not
found
in
the
reported
teachings
of
that
deified
moralist
but
as
they
appear
to
breathe
forth
the
same
spirit
it
is
presumed
he
would
have
indorsed
them
had
they
come
under
his
notice
as
christians
assume
the
liberty
to
arrange
the
doctrines
of
paul
and
peter
under
the
head
of
christianity
because
claimed
to
be
in
consonance
with
the
religion
of
christ
though
not
all
taught
by
him
the
author
in
like
manner
has
assumed
that
some
doctrines
taught
by
other
systems
and
religious
teachers
of
india
accord
with
those
taught
by
chrishna
and
hence
has
arranged
them
with
his
the
author
purpose
is
not
to
set
forth
the
doctrines
of
any
sect
any
system
or
any
religious
teacher
but
to
show
that
all
the
doctrines
of
christianity
are
traceable
to
ancient
india
but
whether
taught
by
this
sect
or
that
sect
it
is
foreign
to
our
purpose
to
inquire
and
hence
for
convenience
he
has
arranged
them
all
into
one
system
and
designated
them
chrishnianity
borrowing
a
new
term
there
can
be
no
more
impropriety
he
presumes
in
arranging
the
doctrines
of
the
various
conflicting
sects
of
india
into
one
system
including
even
brahminism
and
budhism
than
to
arrange
as
christians
do
the
doctrines
taught
by
the
antagnostic
system
of
catholicism
and
protestantism
and
their
six
hundred
conflicting
sects
under
the
head
of
christianity
hence
christians
of
course
will
not
fault
the
arrangement
the
classification
above
alluded
to
comprises
in
part
the
religion
of
many
of
the
hindoo
sects
but
does
not
set
forth
all
their
doctrines
only
those
analogous
to
christianity
chrishna
was
a
vishnuite
and
not
a
brahmin
as
some
writers
assume
he
and
christ
were
both
reformers
and
departed
from
the
ancient
faith
vishnuism
appears
to
have
finally
centered
in
budhism

osiris
magus
gods
miraculous
achievements
of
other
gods
and
of
antiquity
the
age
in
which
christ
flourished
as
before
remarked
was
an
age
of
miracle
the
practice
of
thaumaturgy
and
the
legends
invested
with
the
display
of
the
power
both
preceding
and
subsequent
to
that
era
rose
to
a
great
height
all
nations
of
that
time
says
a
writer
were
mightily
bent
on
working
miracles
and
the
disciples
who
acted
the
part
of
biographers
for
the
various
crucified
gods
and
saviors
throughout
the
east
seemed
to
vie
with
each
other
in
setting
off
the
lives
and
histories
of
their
favorite
objects
of
worship
respectively
with
marvelous
exploits
and
the
pageantry
of
the
most
astounding
prodigies
and
the
miracles
in
each
case
were
pretty
much
of
the
same
character
thus
indicating
a
common
course
for
their
origin
all
probably
having
been
cast
in
the
same
mold
in
the
theological
schools
of
the
once
famous
city
of
alexandria
the
capital
of
egypt
having
in
the
preceding
chapters
presented
the
miraculous
achievements
of
the
hindoo
gods
chrishna
and
saki
we
will
here
bring
to
notice
those
of
other
gods
the
miracles
recorded
of
alcides
osiris
and
other
gods
of
egypt
we
have
the
miraculous
birth
by
a
virgin
in
the
case
of
alcides
osiris
while
a
sucking
infant
in
his
cradle
killed
two
serpents
which
came
to
destroy
him
alcides
performed
many
miraculous
cures
according
to
ovid
he
cured
by
a
miracle
the
daughter
of
archiades
also
the
wife
of
theogenes
after
the
doctors
had
given
her
up
and
both
these
gods
converted
water
into
wine
both
of
them
frequently
cast
out
devils
julius
declares
alcides
raised
tyndarus
and
from
the
dead
when
zulis
was
crucified
the
sun
became
dark
and
the
moon
refused
to
shine
both
he
and
osiris
were
resurrected
by
a
miracle
both
ascend
to
heaven
in
sight
of
many
witnesses
and
finally
we
are
told
that
from
alexandria
the
whole
empire
became
filled
with
the
fame
of
these
who
restored
the
blind
to
sight
cured
the
paralytic
caused
the
dumb
to
speak
the
lame
to
walk
all
these
miracles
were
as
credibly
related
of
these
gods
as
similar
miracles
of
jesus
christ
miracles
performed
by
pythagoras
and
other
gods
of
greece
pythagoras
was
a
spirit
in
heaven
before
he
was
born
on
earth
his

was
miraculously

could
approach

subdue
the
wild
ferocious

poisonous
reptiles
with
impunity
cured
all
manner

restored
sight
to
the
blind
he
cast
out
devils
jamblicus
says
he
could
allay
storms
on
the
sea
raised
several
persons
from
the
dead
and
finally
a
thousand
other
wonderful
things
are
told
of
him
says
jamblicus
with
respect
to
his
character
it
is
said
that
for
humility
and
practical
goodness
and
the
wisdom
of
his
moral
precepts
he
stood
without
a
rival
he
discarded
bloody
sacrifices
discouraged
wars
forbade
the
use
of
wine
and
other
intoxicating
drinks
enjoined
the
forgiveness
of
enemies
and
their
kind
treatment
and
also
respect
to
parents
he
was
a
special
friend
to
the
poor
and
taught
that
they
were
the
favorites
of
god
blessed
are
ye
poor
he
practiced
and
recommended
the
silent
worship
of
god
he
retired
from
the
world
and
often
fasted
and
was
a
great
enemy
to
riches
like
jesus
christ
he
considered
poverty
a
virtue
and
despised
the
pomp
of
the
world
he
recommended
like
christ
the
abandonment
of
parents
relations
and
friends
houses
and
lands
for
religion
sake
his
disciples
like
those
of
christ
had
a
common
treasury
and
a
general
community
of
goods
to
which
all
had
free
access
so
that
there
was
no
poverty
or
suffering
amongst
them
while
the
supply
lasted
all
shared
alike
in
fact
with
respect
to
the
spirit
of
his
precepts
his
moral
lessons
and
nearly
his
whole
practical
life
he
bore
a
striking
resemblance
to
jesus
christ
and
presented
the
same
kind
of
evidence
and
equally
convincing
evidence
of
being
a
god
and
as
he
was
born
into
the
world
five
hundred
and
years
before
christ
the
latter
probably
obtained
the
materials
of
his
moral
system
from
that
grecian
teacher
or
in
the
same
school
of
the
essenian
budhists
in
which
both
pythagoras
and
christ
appear
to
have
taken
lessons
miracles
of
the
roman
gods
quirinus
and
prometheus
prometheus
was
honored
with
a
miraculous
birth
quirinus
was
miraculously
preserved
in
infancy
when
threatened
with
destruction
by
the
tyrant
ruler
amulius
he
performed
the
miracles
according
to
seneca
and
hesiod
of
curing
the
sick
restoring
the
blind
raising
the
dead
and
casting
out
devils
both
these
gods
were
crucified
amid
signs
and
wonders
and
miracles
all
nature
was
convulsed
and
the
saints
arose
when
they
were
crucified
the
sun
was
also
darkened
and
refused
to
shine
both
descended
to
hell
and
rose
from
it
by
divine
power
and
prometheus
was
seen
to
ascend
to
heaven
we
cite
these
lists
of
miraculous
events
as
if
real
facts
not
because
we
believe
they
were
such
but
as
possessing
the
same
degree
of
credibility
as
those
related

was
also

possessed
exalted
views
of

by
getting
him
to
feel
the
print
of
the
nails
in
his
hands
and
feet
was
seen
by
many
witnesses
after
his
resurrection
and
was
hailed
by
them
as
the
god
incarnate
the
lord
from
heaven
he
finally
ascended
back
to
heaven
and
now
sits
at
the
right
hand
of
the
father
pleading
for
a
sinful
world
when
he
entered
the
temple
of
diana
a
voice
from
above
was
heard
saying
to
heaven
accordingly
he
was
seen
no
more
on
earth
only
as
a
spirit
the
reader
will
observe
that
the
foregoing
list
of
analogies
drawn
from
the
history
of
apollonius
as
furnished
us
by
his
disciple
damos
and
his
biographer
philostratus
are
found
also
in
almost
every
particular
in
the
history
of
jesus
christ
and
the
list
might
have
been
extended
it
is
declared
a
beauty
shone
in
his
countenance
and
the
words
he
uttered
were
divine
which
reminds
us
of
christ
transfiguration
and
his
staying
a
plague
at
ephesus
revives
the
case
of
christ
stilling
the
tempest
on
the
waters
now
the
question
very
naturally
arises
here
how
came
the
histories
of
apollonius
and
christ
to
be
so
strikingly
alike
was
one
plagiarized
from
the
other
as
for
the
miraculous
history
of
apollonius
being
reconstructed
from
that
of
jesus
christ
as
some
christians
have
assumed
there
is
not
the
slightest
foundation
for
such
a
conclusion
as
the
following
facts
will
show
viz
the
cappadocian
savior
apollonius
was
born
several
years
anterior
to
the
advent
of
the
christian
savior
and
appeared
at
an
earlier
date
upon
the
stage
of
active
life
and
thus
got
the
start
of
christ
in
the
promulgations
of
his
doctrines
and
the
exhibition
of
his
miracles
christ
active
life
christians
concede
and
the
bible
proves
did
not
commence
till
about
his
or
thirtieth
year
which
was
long
after
apollonius
had
inaugurated
his
religion
and
long
after
he
had
commenced
the
promulgation
of
his
doctrines
and
attested
them
by
wonderful
miracles
according
to
his
biographer
philostratus
the
new
american
cyclopedia
tells
us
apollonius
labored
for
the
purity
of
paganism
and
to
sustain
its
tottering
edifice
against
the
assaults
of
the
christians
so
that
being
placed
in
a
hostile
attitude
toward
the
representatives
of
the
christian
faith
it
is
not
likely
he
would
condescend
to
borrow
their
doctrines
and
the
miraculous
history
of
their
incarnate
god
to
invest
his
own
life
with
he
was
probably
one
of
the
spoken
of
in
the
new
testament
but
this
circumstance
reflects
nothing
dishonorable
upon
his
character
for
some
of
those
distinguished
personages
denounced
as
by
christ
gospel
biographers
were
according
to
impartial
history
noble
honest
and
righteous
men
their
only
offense
consisted
in
robbing
christ
of
his
divine
laurels
by
claiming
similar
titles
and
claiming
to
perform
the
same
kind
of
miracles
and
there
is
as
much
proof
that
they
did
achieve
these
prodigies
as
that
christ
did
the
early
christian
writers
conceded
that
apollonius
and
the
other
oriental
gods
did
perform
the
miracles
which
are
ascribed
to
them
by
their
respective
disciples
but
accounted
for
it
by
the
childish
expedient
of
obsession
christ
was
assumed
to
perform
miracles
by
divine
power
they
by
the
power
of
the
devil
a
childish
and
senseless
distinction
truly
and
one
which
can
have
no
logical
force
in
this
enlightened
age
miracles
and
claims
for
simon
magus
it
is
declared
he
was
in
the
beginning
with
god
that
he
existed
with
god
from
all
eternity
that
he
took
upon
himself
the
form
of
a
man
that
he
was
the
son
of
god
the
word
that
he
was
the
second
person
in
the
godhead
that
he
came
down
to
destroy
the
devil
and
his
works
that
he
was
the
image
of
the
eternal
father
that
he
was
the
son
of
god
that
he
could
control
the
elements
that
he
could
walk
on
the
air
as
christ
did
on
the
water
could
move
anything
by
the
command
be
thou
removed
that
he
could
raise
the
dead
that
he
could
transform
himself
into
the
image
of
any
man
that
he
was
the
paraclete
or
comforter
that
he
came
to
redeem
the
world
from
sin
finally
he
was
the
world
savior
redeemer
the
only
begotten
of
the
father
and
through
his
name
men
are
to
be
saved
the
reader
will
call
to
mind
that
this
simon
magus
is
mentioned
and
condemned
in
the
acts
of
the
apostles
for
offering
to
pay
peter
for
a
bestowment
of
the
gift
of
the
holy
ghost
and
yet
every
philosopher
in
this
age
must
concede
that
magus
assumption
in
the
case
is
more
sensible
and
philosophical
than
that
of
peter
for
the
latter
calls
it
a
gift
from
god
whereas
every
person
now
acquainted
with
the
nature
principles
and
science
of
animal
magnetism
knows
that
such
manifestation
as
that
which
peter
ascribes
to
god
and
the
holy
ghost
is
a
simple
natural
phenomenon
and
that
consequently
it
can
be
no
more
a
violation
of
the
rules
of
propriety
to
pay
for
the
labor
of
making
such
developments
than
it
is
to
pay
a
teacher
for
developing
the
mind
of
a
child
it
was
certainly
a
greater
act
of
courtesy
to
offer
to
pay
for
it
than
to
demand
it
as
a
gratuitous
favor
hence
we
infer
he
excelled
peter
in
his
demeanor
as
a
gentleman
especially
as
he
bore
severe
reprimand
with
patience
and
apparently
with
a
better
spirit
than
that
which
dictated
it
and
we
may
remark
here
also
that
notwithstanding
this
samaritan
jew
is
so
unsparingly
denounced
by
the
godly
peter
and
by
the
early
christian
fathers
also
yet
we
have
the
historical
proof
that
he
was
an
honest
pious
and
ardently
devout
man
his
whole
life
was
absorbed
in
the
cause
of
religion
and
his
whole
soul
devoted
to
his
religious
duties
and
the
worship
of
his
god
hence
we
think
peter
rebuke
was
uncalled
for
let
the
reader
note
the
fact
here
that
there
are
three
circumstances
amply
sufficient
to
account
for
bibles
and
religious
books
being
profusely
supplied
with
the
reports
of
groundless
miracles
as
everybody
then
believed
in
miracles
at
least
everybody
who
dared
speak
there
was
nobody
to
investigate
the
reports
of
such
occurrences
to
learn
whether
they
were
true
or
false
the
few
who
attempted
to
disprove
the
truth
of
those
miraculous
occurrences
now
found
reported
in
sacred
history
had
their
books
burned
as
in
the
case
of
porphyry
and
celsus
in
the
early
history
of
christianity
who
called
in
question
the
truth
of
bible
miracles
these
marvelous
facts
were
not
usually
recorded
till
long
after
the
period
in
which
they
are
said
to
have
occurred
when
the
witnesses
had
left
the
stage
of
time
and
every
event
exciting
ay
attention
had
grown
to
a
monstrous
prodigy
these
circumstances
in
an
age
of
boundless
credulity
and
scientific
ignorance
which
magnified
every
phenomenon
and
looked
upon
every
natural
event
as
a
direct
display
of
divine
power
accounts
most
fully
and
satisfactorily
for
the
burdensome
repetition
of
groundless
miraculous
stories
found
upon
nearly
every
page
of
the
sacred
history
of
every
religious
nation
without
driving
us
to
the
necessity
of
challenging
the
veracity
of
the
writers
who
recorded
them
they
may
all
have
been
honest
men
confucius
of
china
born
this
moral
teacher
religious
chieftain
and
philosopher
though
not
subjected
to
the
ignominious
death
of
the
cross
deserves
a
passing
notice
for
the
excellency
of
his
morals
and
the
acquisition
of
a
fame
in
the
following
particulars
his
history
bears
a
strong
analogy
to
that
of
jesus
christ
he
commenced
as
a
religious
teacher
when
about
thirty
years
of
age
the
golden
rule
see
chap
xxxiv
was
his
favorite
maxim
most
of
his
moral
maxims
were
sound
and
of
a
high
order
the
new
american
cyclopedia
says
vol
his
writings
approach
the
christian
standard
of
morality
and
in
some
respects
they
excel
he
traveled
in
different
countries
preaching
and
teaching
his
doctrines
he
made
a
host
of
converts
amounting
now
to
one
hundred
and
fifty
millions
his
religion
and
morals
have
been
propagated
by
apostles
and
missionaries
some
of
whom
are
now
traveling
in
this
country
laboring
to
convert
christians
to
their
superior
religion
and
morals
there
was
a
time
says
the
work
above
quoted
when
european
philosophers
vied
with
each
other
in
extolling
confucius
as
one
of
the
sublimest
teachers
of
truth
among
mankind
in
the
following
respects
his
teachings
were
superior
to
those
of
christ
he
taught
that
the
knowledge
of
one
self
is
the
basis
of
all
real
advances
in
morals
and
manners
a
lesson
christ
neglected
to
teach
the
duties
man
owes
to
society
and
himself
are
minutely
defined
by
confucius
says
the
cyclopedia
another
important
work
christ
partially
omitted
he
constructed
several
hundred
beautiful
and
instructive
moral
maxims
which
we
have
not
space
for
here
and
which
amply
prove
that
the
holiest
truths
were
inculcated
by
pagan
philosophers
chapter
xxxiv
the
three
pillars
of
the
christian
faith
miracles
prophecies
and
precepts
when
christians
are
asked
for
the
proof
of
the
divinity
of
jesus
christ
they
point
to
his
miracles
and
precepts
and
the
messianic
prophecies
said
to
have
been
fulfilled
by
his
coming
and
the
same
kind
of
evidence
is
adduced
to
prove
the
divine
claims
of
their
bible
and
its
religion
including
the
old
testament
which
contains
the
prophecies
their
divine
origin
and
supernatural
character
are
claimed
to
be
proved
by
the
miracles
prophecies
and
precepts
found
recorded
in
the
holy
book
all
then
stand
or
fall
together
the
divinity
of
christ
and
the
divinity
of
the
bible
and
its
religion
all
rest
on
this
threefold
argument
all
it
is
claimed
are
attested
and
proved
by
a
threefold
display
of
divine
power
manifested
by
the
performance
of
various
acts
transcending
human
power
and
the
laws
of
nature
called
miracles
by
the
discernment
of
events
lying
in
the
future
which
no
human
sagacity
or
prescience
could
have
foreseen
unless
aided
by
omniscience
the
display
of
such
power
being
called
prophecy
by
the
enunciation
of
moral
precepts
beyond
the
mental
capacity
of
human
beings
to
originate
these
three
propositions
cover
the
whole
ground
they
constitute
the
three
grand
pillars
of
the
christian
faith
which
if
shown
to
be
untenable
must
prostrate
the
whole
superstructure
to
the
ground
we
will
examine
each
separately
commencing
with
miracles
miracles
the
first
pillar
of
the
christian
faith
we
will
not
occupy
space
in
discussing
the
various
meanings
assigned
to
the
word
miracle
by
different
writers
but
take
the
popular
definition
as
given
above
and
proceed
to
inquire
how
much
evidence
can
be
deduced
from
the
miracles
represented
as
having
been
performed
by
jesus
christ
toward
proving
his
divinity
and
the
truth
of
his
religion
in
the
first
place
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
christianity
is
not
the
only
religion
which
appeals
to
miracles
as
a
proof
of
its
divine
authorship
more
than
three
hundred
systems
and
sects
are
reported
in
history
most
of
which
have
from
time
immemorial
gloried
in
being
able
to
wield
this
argument
as
they
claim
it
to
be
in
support
of
the
truth
and
divine
authenticity
of
their
various
systems
of
faith
we
have
briefly
noticed
some
of
the
miraculous
achievements
reported
in
their
sacred
books
and
ascribed
to
their
gods
and
saviors
and
compare
them
with
similar
ones
related
of
jesus
christ
commencing
with
pagan
miracles
as
the
whole
pathway
of
religious
history
is
thickly
with
miracles
wrought
in
all
ages
and
countries
and
every
page
of
the
oriental
bibles
and
religious
books
is
literally
loaded
down
with
the
relation
of
these
marvelous
prodigies
said
to
have
been
wrought
by
their
gods
demigods
and
crucified
saviors
it
places
a
writer
in
a
quandary
to
know
where
to
begin
to
make
a
selection
we
will
express
no
opinion
here
as
to
whether
these
astounding
feats
were
ever
witnessed
or
not
but
will
merely
state
that
they
come
to
us
as
well
authenticated
as
those
reported
in
the
christian
bible
there
is
as
much
evidence
that
zoroaster
at
the
request
of
king
gustaph
caused
a
tree
to
spring
up
in
a
man
yard
forthwith
of
such
magnificent
proportions
that
no
rope
could
be
found
large
enough
to
reach
around
it
as
that
jesus
christ
caused
a
fig
tree
to
wither
away
by
merely
cursing
it
and
we
have
the
same
kind
of
evidence
that
the
hindoo
messiah
chrishna
of
india
restored
two
boys
to
life
who
had
been
killed
by
the
bites
of
serpents
as
that
jesus
christ
resurrected
lazarus
and
the
widow
son
of
nain
and
as
much
proof
that
bacchus
turned
water
into
wine
as
that
jesus
performed
this
act
six
hundred
years
after
and
a
hundred
other
similar
comparisons
might
be
drawn
the
evidence
of
the
truth
of
these
performances
in
both
cases
pagan
and
christian
is
simply
the
report
of
the
writer
if
there
are
any
exceptions
to
be
made
in
either
case
of
better
evidence
it
will
be
found
in
favor
of
pagan
religion
for
its
adherents
are
able
in
many
cases
to
point
to
imperishable
monuments
of
stone
erected
in
commemoration
of
their
miracles
and
goodrich
tells
us
this
is
the
highest
species
of
evidence
that
can
be
offered
to
prove
the
truth
of
any
ancient
event
but
as
christians
on
the
other
hand
can
find
no
such
evidence
to
prove
the
performance
of
any
miracles
reported
in
their
bible
it
will
be
seen
at
once
that
the
pagan
miracles
are
the
best
authenticated
the
famous
historian
pausanias
states
upon
current
authority
that
esculapius
raised
several
persons
from
the
dead
and
names
hippolytus
among
the
number
and
then
points
to
a
stone
monument
erected
as
a
proof
of
the
occurrence
thus
furnishing
according
to
christian
logic
the
most
conclusive
proof
of
one
of
the
most
astounding
miracles
ever
wrought
and
yet
no
philosopher
or
man
of
science
in
this
age
can
credit
the
literal
truth
of
the
story
but
a
spiritualist
can
easily
conceive
that
he
and
others
might
have
mistaken
the
risen
spirits
of
those
resurrected
persons
for
their
physical
bodies
because
they
know
that
many
mistakes
of
this
kind
have
occurred
in
modern
times
we
might
refer
to
many
other
cases
of
pagan
miracles
attested
by
monumental
evidence
if
our
space
would
permit
such
as
the
names
of
many
persons
engraven
upon
the
walls
of
the
temple
of
serapis
miraculously
carved
by
the
god
esculapius
strabo
tells
us
the
ancient
temples
are
full
of
tablets
describing
miraculous
cures
performed
by
gods
of
those
times
and
names
a
case
of
two
blind
men
being
restored
to
sight
by
the
son
of
god
alcides
in
the
presence
of
a
large
multitude
of
people
who
acknowledged
the
miraculous
power
of
the
god
with
loud
acclaim
many
spiritualists
at
the
present
day
know
by
practical
experience
how
these
miraculous
cures
were
performed
without
continuing
the
citation
of
cases
suffice
it
to
say
the
gods
of
the
orientals
are
reported
as
performing
the
same
train
of
miracles
assigned
to
jesus
christ
such
as
performing
astonishing
cures
casting
out
devils
raising
the
dead
now
sadly
warped
indeed
by
education
must
be
that
mind
which
can
not
see
that
if
the
account
of
such
prodigies
reported
in
the
history
of
jesus
christ
can
do
anything
towards
proving
him
to
have
been
a
god
then
the
world
must
have
been
full
of
gods
long
before
his
time
it
is
impossible
to
dodge
or
evade
such
a
conclusion
christians
are
in
the
habit
of
assuming
that
all
the
miraculous
reports
in
the
bible
are
unquestionably
true
while
those
reported
in
pagan
bibles
are
mere
fables
and
fiction
but
if
they
will
reverse
this
proposition
it
can
be
easier
supported
because
we
have
shown
their
miracles
are
better
attested
and
authenticated
their
own
bible
admits
that
the
heathen
not
only
could
and
did
perform
miracles
but
miraculous
prodigies
of
the
most
astonishing
character
equal
to
anything
reported
in
their
own
religious
history
such
as
transmuting
water
into
blood
sticks
into
serpents
and
stones
into
frogs
in
a
word
it
is
admitted
they
performed
all
the
miraculous
feats
of
moses
with
the
single
exception
of
turning
dust
into
lice
but
certainly
making
lice
was
not
a
more
difficult
achievement
than
that
of
making
frogs
and
this
is
admitted
they
did
do
successfully
hence
it
will
be
seen
that
the
egyptian
pagans
made
as
great
a
display
of
divine
or
miraculous
power
as
god
holy
people
according
to
the
admission
of
the
bible
itself
and
there
is
no
intimation
that
the
mode
of
performing
the
miracles
was
not
the
same
in
both
cases
but
a
strong
probability
exists
that
it
was
a
conclusion
confirmed
by
the
bible
report
of
the
case
which
leads
us
to
infer
that
they
performed
the
miracles
in
the
same
way
moses
did
for
it
is
said
the
egyptians
did
so
with
their
enchantments
that
is
with
the
enchanting
rod
used
on
such
occasions
by
the
egyptians
assyrians
babylonians
and
other
nations
including
also
the
jews
now
as
moses
always
used
the
enchanting
rod
in
performing
miracles
called
by
him
the
rod
of
god
the
rod
of
divination
see
ex
iv
there
is
thus
furnished
the
most
satisfactory
proof
that
he
performed
his
miracles
on
this
occasion
as
well
as
all
other
occasions
by
the
same
stratagem
as
the
egyptians
and
other
nations
did
and
even
if
the
mode
adopted
by
the
egyptians
had
been
different
it
is
still
admitted
they
performed
the
miracles
in
the
name
of
reason
and
common
sense
then
we
ask
if
such
facts
as
here
presented
with
the
case
just
referred
to
do
not
forever
prostrate
and
annihilate
all
arguments
based
on
miracles
toward
proving
the
divine
character
or
divine
origin
of
the
religion
of
the
bible
or
towards
proving
jesus
christ
or
any
other
being
reported
to
have
performed
miracles
as
possessing
divine
attributes
catholic
miracles
some
of
the
most
astonishing
and
best
authenticated
miracles
ever
performed
by
any
religious
sect
we
find
reported
in
the
history
of
the
roman
catholic
church
looked
upon
and
styled
by
the
protestants
the
mother
of
harlots
and
abomination
and
yet
there
is
much
stronger
proof
that
the
catholic
religion
has
the
divine
sanction
if
miracles
can
furnish
such
proof
the
editor
of
the
official
memoirs
declares
that
during
the
italian
war
in
several
pictures
of
the
virgin
mary
situated
in
different
parts
of
the
country
were
seen
to
open
and
shut
their
eyes
for
the
space
of
six
or
seven
months
and
that
no
less
than
sixty
thousand
people
actually
saw
this
miracle
performed
including
many
bishops
deacons
cardinals
and
other
officers
of
the
church
whose
names
are
given
and
forsyth
italy
written
by
a
highly
accredited
author
tells
us
that
a
withered
elm
tree
was
suddenly
restored
to
full
life
and
vigor
by
coming
in
contact
with
the
body
of
zenobis
and
that
this
miracle
took
place
in
the
most
public
part
of
the
town
in
the
presence
of
many
thousands
of
people
that
it
is
recorded
by
contemporary
historians
and
inscribed
upon
a
marble
column
now
standing
where
the
tree
stood
now
the
question
may
be
asked
here
would
the
people
have
allowed
such
an
impudent
trick
to
insult
them
as
the
erection
of
a
monument
for
an
event
that
never
took
place
if
not
how
is
the
matter
to
be
explained
these
are
only
specimens
of
a
hundred
more
catholic
miracles
of
an
astonishing
character
at
our
command
several
queries
may
be
entertained
in
the
solution
of
these
stories
were
some
phenomena
really
witnessed
on
which
these
stories
were
constructed
but
which
got
magnified
from
a
molehill
to
a
mountain
before
they
found
their
way
into
history
or
were
they
manufactured
as
a
pious
fraud
which
was
rather
a
fashionable
business
with
the
early
disciples
of
the
christian
faith
according
to
mosheim
whatever
answer
may
be
given
to
these
questions
will
explain
the
miracles
of
the
christian
bible
excepting
those
which
can
be
accounted
for
on
natural
principles
satanic
miracles
among
all
the
workers
of
miracles
reported
in
the
bible
the
devil
seems
to
have
been
and
hence
must
come
in
for
the
better
end
of
the
argument
toward
proving
him
to
have
been
a
god
no
miracle
could
excel
the
act
of
his
transforming
himself
into
an
angel
of
light
as
stated
in
cor
xi
it
is
not
transcended
by
any
other
case
not
even
by
christ
transfiguration
and
according
to
paul
he
was
endowed
with
all
power
and
signs
and
lying
wonders
thess
ii
if
then
he
possessed
all
power
christ
and
no
other
god
could
have
possessed
a
miraculous
power
superior
to
his
for
all
comprehends
the
whole
beyond
which
nothing
can
reach
where
then
is
the
evidence
to
come
from
to
prove
that
christ
was
a
god
because
he
was
a
or
his
religion
divine
because
attested
by
miracles
seeing
the
devil
performed
some
of
the
most
difficult
miracles
ever
wrought
should
we
not
then
change
his
title
from
that
of
a
demon
to
a
god
and
place
his
religion
amongst
the
divinely
endowed
systems
john
represents
the
evil
one
as
having
power
to
make
fire
come
down
from
heaven
in
the
sight
of
men
and
to
deceive
those
that
dwell
on
the
earth
by
means
of
those
miracles
which
he
hath
power
to
do
rev
xiii
here
the
question
arises
what
can
a
miracle
prove
what
end
can
it
serve
or
what
good
can
possibly
arise
from
the
display
of
the
power
when
it
is
liable
to
deceive
those
that
dwell
upon
the
earth
certainly
therefore
it
proves
nothing
and
accomplishes
nothing
and
may
not
the
apostles
themselves
have
been
deceived
in
ascribing
some
of
the
miracles
they
record
to
jesus
instead
of
the
devil
certainly
we
are
drifted
upon
the
quicksands
of
uncertainty
by
such
a
display
of
the
power
and
are
obnoxious
to
most
fatal
deception
which
proves
the
total
inutility
and
futility
of
such
prodigies
christ
miracles
not
his
own
but
wrought
through
him
and
not
by
him
how
could
christ
miracles
assuming
they
were
wrought
do
anything
toward
proving
his
divinity
when
he
did
not
claim
to
be
their
author
but
merely
the
agent
or
instrument
in
the
hands
of
the
father
like
the
apostles
who
are
reported
to
have
performed
the
same
miracles
the
father
he
doeth
the
work
is
his
own
declaration
and
the
apostles
seem
to
have
accepted
his
word
and
his
view
of
the
matter
for
proof
listen
to
peter
ye
men
of
israel
hear
these
words
jesus
of
nazareth
a
man
approved
of
god
among
you
by
miracles
and
wonders
and
signs
which
god
did
by
him
in
the
midst
of
you
as
ye
yourselves
do
know
acts
ii
let
it
be
noted
then
the
christ
miracles
were
not
performed
by
him
as
a
god
but
as
a
man
approved
of
god
he
was
the
mere
medium
or
instrument
in
the
case
a
fact
which
banishes
at
once
all
grounds
for
controversy
relative
to
his
miracles
serving
the
purpose
of
attesting
his
divinity
especially
when
it
is
conceded
that
men
magicians
and
devils
could
achieve
the
same
feats
christ
miracles
did
not
convince
the
people
as
the
miracles
of
christ
seem
to
have
had
little
effect
toward
convincing
the
people
of
his
claims
to
the
godhead
it
is
evident
they
could
have
been
but
little
superior
to
those
performed
by
others
and
therefore
not
designed
at
least
not
calculated
to
convince
them
that
he
was
a
god
the
frequent
instances
in
which
he
upbraids
the
people
for
their
unbelief
and
calls
them
fools
slow
of
heart
is
a
proof
of
this
statement
christ
miracles
not
designed
to
convince
the
people
a
circumstance
involving
pretty
strong
proof
that
christ
miraculous
achievements
were
not
considered
as
evidence
of
his
divinity
is
the
fact
that
they
were
frequently
performed
in
private
sometimes
in
the
night
and
often
under
the
injunction
of
secrecy
see
thou
tell
no
man
was
the
injunction
after
the
feat
was
performed
perhaps
in
a
private
room
how
can
such
facts
be
reconciled
with
the
assumption
that
his
miracles
were
designed
to
convince
the
people
of
his
claims
to
the
divine
entity
as
christians
frequently
assert
when
the
people
were
not
allowed
to
witness
them
nor
his
disciples
even
to
report
them
who
can
believe
that
he
was
a
divine
being
or
messiah
when
he
charged
his
disciples
to
tell
no
man
that
he
was
such
a
being
such
incongruities
verge
to
a
contradiction
it
is
a
logical
contradiction
to
say
that
private
miracles
were
designed
to
dissolve
public
skepticism
and
yet
many
if
not
most
of
his
reputed
miraculous
achievements
were
of
this
character
when
he
cured
a
blind
man
he
not
only
led
him
out
of
the
town
mark
viii
but
forbid
him
when
his
sight
was
restored
returning
to
the
city
for
fear
he
would
publish
it
when
he
resurrected
lazarus
he
did
not
call
the
whole
country
around
to
witness
it
but
performed
the
act
before
a
private
party
the
reanimation
of
daughter
was
in
the
same
concealed
manner
in
a
private
room
where
nobody
was
admitted
but
his
three
confidential
disciples
peter
james
and
john
and
the
parents
none
of
whom
make
any
report
of
the
case
how
therefore
the
reporter
mark
found
it
out
when
he
was
not
present
and
none
of
the
party
were
allowed
to
tell
it
to
anybody
or
why
he
should
betray
his
trust
by
publishing
it
if
he
was
informed
of
it
is
a
mystery
of
godliness
not
easily
divined
when
christ
cleansed
the
leper
he
sent
him
to
the
priest
enjoining
him
to
say
nothing
to
any
man
the
dumb
when
restored
to
speech
was
not
allowed
to
exhibit
any
practical
proof
of
the
fact
by
using
his
tongue
his
miraculous
perambulation
on
the
surface
of
the
sea
walking
on
the
water
was
not
only
alone
but
in
the
dark
his
transfiguration
likewise
according
to
barnes
took
place
in
the
night
his
three
favorite
companions
being
the
only
witnesses
and
they
heavy
with
sleep
and
finally
the
crowning
miracle
of
all
the
resurrection
is
not
only
represented
as
taking
place
in
the
night
but
without
one
substantial
or
terrestrial
witness
to
report
it
verily
such
facts
as
these
are
not
calculated
to
augment
the
faith
jr
work
the
conviction
of
a
skeptic
that
these
miracles
were
ever
performed
seeing
so
few
are
reported
as
witnessing
them
and
even
their
testimony
is
not
given
we
have
not
the
testimony
of
one
person
who
claims
to
have
been
present
and
seen
these
wonders
performed
such
facts
are
calculated
to
cast
distrust
upon
the
whole
matter
especially
when
taken
in
connection
with
the
fact
that
nine
tenths
of
his
life
form
a
perfect
blank
in
history
is
it
possible
we
ask
to
reconcile
such
a
fact
with
the
belief
of
his
divinity
is
it
possible
a
god
could
lead
a
private
life
or
live
years
on
earth
and
do
nothing
worthy
of
note
a
god
known
to
nobody
and
noticed
by
nobody
most
transcendingly
absurd
is
such
a
thought
had
christ
possessed
the
character
that
is
claimed
for
him
not
an
hour
of
his
life
could
have
passed
unaccompanied
by
some
remarkable
incident
that
would
have
been
heralded
abroad
and
its
record
indelibly
engraven
upon
the
page
of
history
but
instead
of
this
his
acts
were
too
commonplace
to
be
noticed
all
history
ignores
him
the
fact
that
no
history
sacred
or
profane
that
not
one
of
the
three
hundred
histories
of
that
age
makes
the
slightest
allusion
to
christ
or
any
of
the
miraculous
incidents
ingrafted
into
his
life
certainly
proves
with
a
cogency
that
no
logic
can
overthrow
no
sophistry
can
contradict
and
no
honest
skepticism
can
resist
that
there
never
was
such
a
miraculously
endowed
being
as
his
many
orthodox
disciples
claim
him
to
have
been
the
fact
that
christ
finds
no
place
in
the
history
of
the
era
in
which
he
lived
that
not
one
event
of
his
life
is
recorded
by
anybody
but
his
own
interested
and
prejudiced
biographers
settles
the
conclusion
beyond
cavil
or
criticism
that
the
godlike
achievements
ascribed
to
him
are
naught
but
fable
or
fiction
it
not
only
proves
he
was
not
miraculously
endowed
but
proves
he
was
not
even
naturally
endowed
to
such
an
extraordinary
degree
as
to
make
him
an
object
of
general
attention
it
would
be
a
historical
anomaly
without
a
precedent
that
christ
should
have
performed
any
of
the
extraordinary
acts
attributed
to
him
in
the
gospels
and
no
roman
or
grecian
historian
and
neither
philo
nor
josephus
both
writing
in
that
age
and
both
living
almost
on
the
spot
where
they
are
said
to
have
been
witnessed
and
both
recording
minutely
all
the
religious
events
of
that
age
and
country
make
the
slightest
mention
of
one
of
them
nor
their
reputed
authors
such
a
historical
fact
banishes
the
last
shadow
of
faith
in
their
reality
it
is
true
a
few
lines
are
found
in
one
of
josephus
large
works
alluding
to
christ
but
it
is
so
manifestly
a
forgery
that
we
believe
all
modern
critics
of
any
note
even
of
the
orthodox
school
reject
it
as
a
base
interpolation
even
lardner
one
of
the
ablest
defenders
of
the
christian
faith
that
ever
wielded
a
pen
in
its
support
and
who
has
written
ten
large
volumes
to
bolster
it
up
assigns
nine
cogent
reasons
which
we
would
insert
here
if
we
had
space
for
the
conclusion
that
josephus
could
not
have
penned
those
few
lines
found
in
his
jewish
antiquities
referring
to
christ
no
jew
could
possibly
use
such
language
it
would
be
a
glaring
absurdity
to
suppose
a
leading
jew
could
call
jesus
the
christ
when
the
whole
jewish
nation
have
ever
contested
the
claim
with
the
sternest
logic
and
fought
it
to
the
bitter
end
it
ought
therefore
says
lardner
for
the
nine
reasons
which
he
assigns
to
be
forever
discarded
from
any
place
among
the
evidences
of
christianity
life
of
lardner
by
kippis
p
as
the
passage
is
not
found
in
any
edition
of
josephus
prior
to
the
era
of
eusebius
the
suspicion
has
fastened
upon
that
christian
writer
as
being
its
author
who
argued
that
falsehood
might
be
used
as
a
medicine
for
the
benefit
of
the
churches
see
his
eccles
hist
origen
who
lived
before
eusebius
admitted
josephus
makes
no
allusion
to
christ
of
course
the
passage
was
not
then
in
josephus
one
or
two
other
similar
passages
have
been
found
in
other
authors
of
that
era
which
it
is
not
necessary
to
notice
here
as
they
are
rejected
by
christian
writers
it
must
be
conceded
therefore
that
the
numerous
histories
covering
the
epoch
of
the
birth
of
christ
chronicle
none
of
the
astounding
feats
incorporated
in
his
gospel
biographies
as
signalizing
his
earthly
career
and
make
no
mention
of
the
reputed
hero
of
these
achievements
either
by
name
or
character
the
conclusion
is
thus
irresistibly
forced
upon
us
not
only
that
he
was
not
a
but
that
he
must
have
led
rather
an
obscure
life
entirely
incompatible
with
his
being
a
god
or
a
messiah
who
came
to
draw
all
men
unto
him
and
it
should
also
be
noted
here
that
none
of
christ
famous
biographers
matthew
mark
luke
or
john
are
honored
with
a
notice
in
history
till
one
hundred
and
ninety
years
after
the
birth
of
christ
and
then
the
notice
was
by
a
christian
writer
ireneus
we
look
in
vain
says
a
writer
for
any
cotemporary
notice
of
the
gospels
or
christ
the
subject
of
the
gospels
outside
of
the
new
testament
so
little
was
this
of
the
jews
known
that
the
romans
were
compelled
to
pay
one
of
his
apostles
to
turn
traitor
and
act
as
guide
before
they
could
find
him
it
is
impossible
to
observe
this
negative
testimony
of
all
history
against
christ
and
his
miracles
and
not
be
struck
with
amazement
and
seized
with
the
conviction
that
he
was
not
a
god
and
not
a
very
extraordinary
man
who
can
believe
that
a
god
from
off
the
throne
of
heaven
could
make
his
appearance
on
earth
and
while
performing
the
most
astounding
miracles
ever
recorded
in
any
history
or
that
ever
excited
the
credulity
of
any
people
and
be
finally
publicly
crucified
in
the
vicinity
of
a
great
city
and
yet
all
the
histories
written
in
those
times
both
sacred
and
profane
pass
over
with
entire
silence
the
slightest
notice
of
any
of
these
extraordinary
events
impossible
most
impossible
and
when
we
find
that
this
omission
was
so
absolute
that
no
record
was
made
of
the
day
or
year
of
his
birth
by
any
person
in
the
era
in
which
he
lived
and
that
they
were
finally
forgotten
and
hence
that
there
are
as
a
writer
informs
us
no
less
then
one
hundred
and
different
opinions
about
the
matter
the
question
assumes
a
still
more
serious
aspect
from
the
logical
potency
of
these
facts
we
are
driven
to
the
conclusion
that
christ
received
but
little
attention
outside
of
the
circle
of
his
own
credulous
and
interested
followers
and
consequently
stands
on
a
level
with
chrishna
of
india
mithra
of
persia
osiris
of
egypt
and
other
demigods
of
antiquity
all
whose
miraculous
legends
were
ingrafted
in
their
histories
long
after
their
death
this
leads
us
to
consider
how
christ
incredible
legends
got
into
his
history
there
is
a
remarkably
easy
and
satisfactory
way
of
accounting
for
all
the
marvelous
feats
and
incredible
stories
found
in
the
gospel
narratives
of
jesus
christ
without
assuming
their
reality
or
any
intentional
fraud
or
falsehood
by
the
writers
when
we
learn
that
none
of
his
evangelical
biographies
were
penned
as
lardner
affirms
till
long
after
his
death
we
are
no
longer
puzzled
for
a
moment
to
understand
exactly
how
many
statements
wholly
incredible
and
morally
impossible
crept
into
his
history
without
challenging
or
calling
in
question
the
veracity
or
honesty
of
the
writer
perhaps
the
most
powerful
cord
of
moral
conviction
which
holds
the
christian
professor
to
a
belief
in
the
divinity
of
jesus
christ
is
the
difficulty
of
bringing
himself
to
believe
that
the
numerous
miracles
ascribed
to
him
in
the
gospels
are
merely
the
work
of
fiction
fabricated
without
a
basis
of
truth
when
they
were
evidently
penned
by
men
of
the
deepest
piety
and
the
strictest
moral
integrity
we
ourselves
were
once
environed
with
this
difficulty
but
it
stands
in
our
way
no
longer
we
are
disenthralled
we
have
solved
the
problem
we
have
found
the
true
explanation
the
key
and
clew
to
the
whole
secret
is
found
in
the
simple
fact
admitted
by
christian
writers
and
evidenced
by
the
bible
itself
that
history
of
christ
practical
life
was
written
out
by
a
person
to
have
been
an
of
the
events
reported
nor
until
every
incident
and
act
of
the
nazarene
had
had
ample
time
to
become
enormously
magnified
and
distorted
by
rumor
fable
and
fiction
so
that
it
was
impossible
to
discriminate
or
separate
the
real
from
the
unreal
the
true
from
the
false
in
his
life
it
could
not
be
done
a
true
history
could
not
then
be
nor
have
been
written
under
such
circumstances
it
is
manifestly
impossible
the
time
for
writing
each
gospel
is
fixed
by
lardner
as
follows
viz
matthew
mark
luke
or
and
john
thus
allowing
ample
time
for
every
noteworthy
incident
of
his
life
to
grow
from
molehills
to
mountains
and
to
swell
into
fiction
fable
and
prodigy
a
tendency
to
which
was
then
very
rife
and
very
prevalent
in
all
religious
countries
having
made
a
note
of
this
fact
let
the
reader
treasure
in
memory
as
another
equally
important
fact
that
the
biography
of
no
man
of
note
who
figured
in
that
era
or
who
lived
prior
to
the
dawn
of
letters
if
penned
many
years
after
his
death
as
was
frequently
the
case
is
free
from
a
large
percentage
of
extravagant
detail
and
simple
incidents
magnified
into
miracles
this
was
the
uncurbed
tendency
of
the
age
which
ultimated
into
universal
custom
the
simplest
incident
in
every
man
life
who
exhibited
mind
enough
to
attract
attention
by
rolling
from
year
to
year
and
passing
from
mouth
to
mouth
invariably
got
to
be
finally
swelled
into
such
undue
and
enormous
proportions
that
it
could
only
be
accounted
for
by
assuming
the
actor
to
have
been
a
god
in
this
way
many
men
of
different
countries
who
had
made
a
mark
in
the
world
received
divine
honors
and
divine
attributes
including
such
characters
as
chrishna
of
india
mithra
of
persia
quirinus
of
rome
eras
of
the
druids
quexalcote
of
mexico
jesus
christ
of
judea
and
many
others
who
might
be
mentioned
this
circumstance
deified
them
the
evidence
of
history
to
prove
this
declaration
is
abundant
and
irresistible
posthumous
histories
alone
deified
men
to
the
two
important
facts
above
cited
that
jesus
evangelical
histories
were
all
written
long
after
his
death
and
that
unwritten
histories
of
great
men
always
become
swollen
and
distorted
with
the
lapse
of
time
let
the
reader
add
the
equally
significant
fact
that
there
is
in
all
cases
a
vast
difference
in
the
biographies
of
famous
men
penned
during
their
actual
lives
or
immediately
subsequent
to
their
death
while
every
act
and
incident
of
their
career
was
fresh
and
vigorous
in
the
minds
and
memories
of
the
cotemporaneous
people
and
before
the
ball
of
exaggerated
rumor
was
set
rolling
compared
with
those
written
at
a
later
date
after
molehills
of
fact
had
become
mountains
of
fiction
the
former
are
natural
and
reasonable
the
latter
unnatural
and
extravagant
and
often
fabulous
we
will
cite
a
few
cases
in
proof
let
the
reader
compare
the
biographical
sketches
of
alexander
the
great
written
near
the
epoch
of
his
practical
life
and
those
composed
since
the
dawn
of
the
christian
era
and
he
will
find
that
the
posthumous
notices
of
him
alone
contain
the
story
of
the
sun
becoming
obscured
and
the
earth
developed
in
darkness
at
the
time
of
his
mortal
exit
it
will
be
found
also
that
virgil
account
of
the
sheeted
dead
rising
from
their
graves
at
the
time
of
caesar
death
and
which
was
written
long
after
that
famous
hero
left
the
stage
of
action
is
omitted
in
all
the
cotemporary
notices
of
that
monarch
having
crept
in
subsequently
in
like
manner
the
various
miracles
recorded
of
pythagoras
by
his
biographer
jamblicus
such
as
his
walking
on
the
air
stilling
the
tempest
raising
the
dead
are
not
related
of
him
by
any
cotemporaneous
writers
who
lived
in
the
era
of
his
practical
life
and
let
the
reader
compare
also
damos
life
of
apollonius
with
that
of
his
later
biography
by
philostratus
as
an
illustration
of
the
same
historical
fact
mahomet
and
his
biograhers
might
be
included
in
the
same
category
it
is
a
remarkable
circumstance
that
neither
mahomet
himself
nor
any
of
his
immediate
followers
claim
for
him
more
than
the
humble
title
of
prophet
or
god
holy
prophet
while
his
later
admirers
and
devout
disciples
have
elevated
him
to
the
throne
of
heaven
and
given
him
a
seat
among
the
gods
and
this
historical
analysis
might
be
extended
much
farther
if
necessary
but
cases
enough
have
been
cited
to
prove
the
principle
and
establish
the
proposition
and
what
is
the
lesson
taught
by
these
facts
a
and
one
from
the
foregoing
historical
illustrations
we
are
impelled
to
the
important
conclusion
that
the
tissue
of
extravagant
and
incredible
stories
of
demigod
performances
which
run
as
a
vein
of
fiction
through
the
gospel
narrations
of
jesus
christ
all
grow
out
of
rumor
in
an
age
when
the
imagination
was
untamed
and
unbounded
and
credulity
uncurbed
by
a
practical
knowledge
of
the
principles
of
science
and
consequently
the
pen
of
the
historian
had
lawless
scope
all
difficulty
then
vanishes
and
the
question
is
put
forever
at
rest
by
assuming
that
if
the
gospel
histories
of
jesus
had
been
written
by
men
who
claimed
to
record
only
what
they
saw
and
heard
themselves
we
should
have
a
more
credible
and
instructive
history
of
the
great
judean
reformer
freed
from
those
munchausen
prodigies
and
that
wild
romance
which
mar
the
beauty
and
credibility
of
those
now
in
popular
use
this
conclusion
is
not
only
natural
but
irresistible
to
a
mind
untrammeled
by
education
and
unbefogged
by
priestcraft
all
that
is
wanting
to
convince
us
that
miracles
constitute
no
part
of
the
real
history
of
christ
is
a
cotemporary
instead
of
a
posthumous
biography
a
history
written
in
the
age
which
knew
him
and
by
an
unprejudiced
writer
who
witnessed
all
his
movements
and
we
are
perfectly
willing
to
risk
our
reputation
in
this
life
and
our
salvation
in
the
next
by
stating
our
conviction
that
this
will
be
the
unanimous
verdict
of
posterity
before
fifty
generations
pass
away
christ
miracles
reconstructed
from
former
miracles
there
are
other
circumstances
than
those
noticed
in
the
preceding
chapter
which
can
aid
us
very
materially
in
solving
the
problem
of
christ
divinity
or
in
other
words
can
aid
us
in
tracing
his
miracles
to
their
origin
and
thus
confirm
the
truth
of
the
preceding
proposition
moses
and
the
prophets
were
considered
by
the
evangelists
antetypes
or
archetypes
of
the
coming
savior
hence
some
of
the
more
important
incidents
of
their
lives
were
hunted
up
and
worked
over
again
to
make
them
fit
the
life
of
christ
as
the
messiah
reconstructed
and
applied
to
him
as
the
second
moses
and
a
new
prophet
for
moses
is
represented
as
saying
a
prophet
shall
the
lord
your
god
raise
up
like
unto
me
hence
moses
comes
in
with
the
prophets
as
an
antetype
of
christ
the
transfiguration
of
christ
is
therefore
constituted
after
the
model
of
the
transfiguration
of
moses
on
mount
sinai
and
christ
is
represented
as
raising
the
dead
not
only
because
elijah
and
elisha
had
performed
such
miracles
but
did
it
under
circumstances
which
prove
as
they
suppose
he
possessed
superior
power
for
while
they
could
only
reanimate
the
body
immediately
after
the
breath
had
left
it
christ
could
raise
a
man
after
he
had
been
dead
four
days
the
case
of
lazarus
hence
the
new
prophet
was
superior
to
the
old
and
more
like
a
god
the
thing
they
desired
to
prove
both
elijah
and
christ
are
represented
as
raising
a
widows
son
elijah
being
considered
the
special
prototype
of
christ
who
many
believed
had
under
the
changed
name
of
elias
see
john
v
and
then
we
observe
that
while
elisha
exhausted
his
skill
in
making
three
gallons
of
oil
christ
could
make
thirty
gallons
of
wine
another
proof
of
the
superiority
of
the
new
prophet
then
again
the
miracle
of
feeding
one
hundred
men
with
twenty
loaves
is
far
excelled
by
the
latter
who
feeds
five
thousand
men
with
five
loaves
and
both
prophets
elisha
and
christ
encountered
unfordable
streams
in
their
travels
the
expedient
of
the
former
is
to
make
a
passage
but
christ
performed
the
greater
miracle
of
walking
on
the
surface
and
while
moses
had
to
send
the
leper
without
the
camp
before
he
could
heal
him
christ
could
heal
him
instantly
with
a
single
touch
the
same
slaughter
of
the
infants
is
commanded
by
herod
in
order
to
destroy
christ
that
pharaoh
had
ordered
to
effect
the
destruction
of
moses
and
thus
many
of
the
miracles
of
jesus
can
be
accounted
for
as
reconstructions
of
former
miracles
it
was
simply
a
competition
or
rivalry
between
the
new
messianic
prophet
and
the
old
prophets
the
new
prophet
excels
and
comes
off
victorious
in
every
case
and
is
thus
considered
to
be
a
god
the
object
of
the
competition
is
to
show
that
while
the
prophets
assisted
by
god
could
perform
marvelous
deeds
christ
being
god
himself
could
perform
greater
this
was
to
be
the
proof
of
his
being
a
god
that
he
could
outvie
the
servants
of
god
in
every
miraculous
thing
ascribed
to
them
this
was
one
way
adopted
to
prove
his
divinity
christ
miracles
manufactured
from
prophecies
several
of
christs
miracles
seem
to
have
grown
out
of
the
messianic
prophecies
that
is
were
manufactured
in
order
to
fulfill
the
prophecies
there
was
as
we
learn
by
the
gospels
an
impression
deep
and
among
the
disciples
of
christ
that
the
old
testament
was
full
of
texts
foretelling
the
advent
of
their
messiah
and
foreshadowing
his
practical
life
under
this
conviction
a
number
of
passages
are
quoted
in
the
gospels
from
the
prophets
as
referring
to
christ
but
which
however
the
context
shows
could
not
possibly
have
been
written
with
any
such
thought
or
intention
matthew
has
five
miracles
appertaining
to
christ
built
on
prophecies
in
his
first
two
chapters
and
they
are
represented
as
taking
place
in
order
that
the
prophecy
might
be
fulfilled
that
is
matthew
writing
years
after
christ
advent
assumes
those
miracles
had
taken
place
because
the
prophecy
required
their
performance
and
hence
recorded
it
as
a
fact
without
knowing
it
to
be
such
a
great
deal
of
that
kind
of
license
was
assumed
in
that
and
subsequent
ages
as
the
facts
of
history
are
ample
to
prove
it
was
done
under
the
religious
conviction
that
the
cause
of
god
and
the
church
required
it
to
be
done
and
that
therefore
it
was
justifiable
strict
veracity
not
required
or
observed
it
is
by
no
means
necessary
to
assume
that
the
recorders
of
the
new
testament
miracles
knew
they
had
been
performed
or
that
they
would
hesitate
to
record
them
as
facts
because
they
did
not
know
them
to
be
such
we
are
under
no
moral
obligation
to
suppose
they
knew
anything
about
it
people
in
that
age
were
not
so
nice
or
so
morally
exact
as
to
require
proof
of
a
thing
before
they
stated
it
or
never
to
state
it
unless
they
had
the
proof
for
its
being
true
we
would
be
very
far
from
accusing
the
apostolic
writers
of
malicious
falsehood
or
criminal
misrepresentation
but
we
find
that
the
disciples
of
all
religions
in
that
age
of
the
world
considered
it
not
only
allowable
but
a
religious
duty
in
the
absence
of
knowledge
to
supply
omissions
by
or
conjecture
that
is
to
use
assumption
in
the
place
of
proof
and
to
state
that
a
thing
was
so
when
there
was
no
proof
of
it
whatever
and
even
when
the
proof
was
against
it
all
religious
history
is
full
of
the
exhibition
of
this
kind
of
elasticity
of
conscience
even
a
species
of
pious
lying
was
considered
justifiable
in
many
cases
paul
furnishes
evidence
of
this
when
he
says
if
the
truth
of
god
hath
more
abounded
through
my
lie
unto
his
glory
why
am
i
judged
a
sinner
rom
iii
no
sin
to
lie
for
the
glory
of
god
seems
to
be
the
teaching
of
this
text
although
paul
does
not
clearly
disclose
for
what
purpose
this
policy
was
employed
yet
it
can
easily
be
inferred
a
part
of
the
important
business
of
the
new
testament
writers
was
to
build
a
reputation
for
christ
and
his
inspired
band
of
disciples
for
working
miracles
a
fame
for
achieving
signs
and
wonders
was
the
great
set
off
of
the
age
there
seems
to
have
been
an
almost
boundless
competition
amongst
the
disciples
of
the
various
religious
orders
including
jews
pagans
and
christians
as
to
who
could
or
whose
god
could
outstrip
all
competitors
in
achieving
astonishing
prodigies
that
should
set
the
laws
of
nature
at
defiance
and
no
devout
disciple
who
had
good
inventive
powers
would
allow
any
rival
to
outdo
him
nothing
could
authenticate
the
claim
of
the
adopted
messiah
to
the
throne
or
heaven
or
a
participation
in
the
divine
essence
like
a
miraculous
display
of
divine
power
hence
the
history
of
all
the
gods
and
of
the
illiterate
ages
including
that
of
christ
is
loaded
down
with
miraculous
feats
there
is
the
clearest
proof
that
christ
disciples
were
in
this
general
rivalry
this
universal
two
things
very
necessary
to
be
accomplished
in
the
estimation
of
the
apostles
were
first
to
show
that
christ
outdid
the
heathen
gods
and
even
the
prophets
in
the
display
of
the
miraculous
power
and
thus
proved
his
divinity
and
second
that
the
prophecies
had
been
fulfilled
in
his
coming
and
his
practical
life
and
there
is
reason
to
believe
all
the
new
testament
miracles
are
founded
on
and
grew
out
of
prophecy
for
although
we
do
not
find
prophecies
in
the
old
testament
for
every
miracle
related
of
christ
yet
it
is
probable
if
we
had
the
book
of
god
the
book
of
jehu
the
like
of
hezekiah
and
other
lost
books
mentioned
in
the
old
testament
we
should
find
the
supposed
prophecy
for
every
miracle
of
the
new
testament
we
should
there
find
the
key
to
every
miracle
the
true
explanation
of
the
matter
seems
to
be
that
the
apostolic
writers
looking
through
the
old
testament
and
finding
texts
therein
which
they
believed
to
be
prophetic
of
the
display
of
the
miraculous
power
of
jesus
and
passages
which
they
religiously
believed
foreshadowed
his
coming
and
mission
or
some
important
event
in
his
history
they
were
impressed
with
the
deepest
conviction
that
god
would
not
suffer
any
prophecy
to
go
unfulfilled
but
when
they
sat
down
to
write
the
history
of
their
messiah
long
after
his
death
they
found
they
had
not
the
evidence
before
them
that
the
prophecies
had
been
fulfilled
a
third
of
a
century
had
rolled
away
since
his
history
had
been
practically
before
the
people
the
subject
of
their
narrative
had
long
since
gone
to
the
house
of
many
mansions
and
left
not
a
note
or
scratch
of
a
pen
of
any
act
of
his
life
behind
him
and
the
current
of
time
had
washed
away
or
partially
obliterated
nearly
every
event
of
his
earthly
career
the
witnesses
had
nearly
all
left
the
stage
of
action
and
their
voices
were
forever
hushed
in
the
silent
tomb
what
was
to
be
done
in
such
an
emergency
it
was
to
show
that
the
prophecies
had
been
fulfilled
to
the
letter
in
his
practical
life
this
quandary
however
did
not
beset
them
long
the
difficulty
was
easily
surmounted
every
religious
country
including
judea
was
full
of
miraculous
legends
and
astonishing
prodigies
appertaining
to
the
terrestrial
movements
of
their
gods
and
demigods
some
of
which
had
floated
down
on
the
stream
of
tradition
from
time
immemorial
and
all
had
become
blended
confounded
and
mixed
up
together
until
it
was
impossible
to
know
whence
they
originated
where
they
belonged
or
to
what
god
they
appertained
these
miraculous
stories
were
so
numerous
and
so
varied
in
character
that
there
was
no
little
difficulty
in
finding
which
seemed
to
be
the
fulfillment
of
any
messianic
prophecy
that
had
been
or
might
be
found
in
the
old
testament
and
thus
of
the
hundreds
of
miraculous
stories
afloat
one
was
picked
out
and
assumed
to
be
the
fulfillment
of
the
prophecy
with
the
countless
number
of
such
stories
before
them
which
had
been
for
half
a
century
current
in
the
community
they
set
themselves
to
work
to
select
and
reject
prune
and
remodel
honestly
believing
that
this
miracle
was
intended
to
fulfill
this
prophecy
and
that
miracle
that
prophecy
and
accordingly
we
now
find
it
so
stated
in
the
new
testament
as
for
example
a
story
had
long
been
going
the
rounds
that
the
parents
of
a
young
god
had
to
flee
with
him
out
of
the
country
to
save
his
life
from
being
destroyed
by
its
jealous
ruler
this
they
supposed
must
of
course
refer
to
jesus
because
they
had
found
a
supposed
prophecy
of
such
an
event
in
the
jewish
bible
when
a
more
thorough
acquaintance
with
history
would
have
taught
them
that
the
story
did
not
refer
to
the
ruler
of
judea
herod
but
to
cansa
an
ancient
jealous
despotic
king
who
ruled
india
at
a
much
earlier
period
and
the
story
of
the
darkness
at
the
crucifixion
they
incorporated
as
a
part
of
the
history
of
jesus
because
they
had
seen
a
text
in
joel
which
they
supposed
presaged
such
an
event
while
if
they
had
been
well
versed
in
oriental
history
they
would
have
known
that
it
had
long
been
recorded
as
the
last
chapter
in
the
earthly
drama
of
the
hindoo
god
chrishna
and
so
of
the
other
miracles
now
found
related
as
a
part
of
the
history
of
jesus
a
historical
investigation
of
the
matter
would
have
shown
the
gospel
writers
that
they
were
a
part
of
the
written
history
of
other
and
more
ancient
gods
and
had
never
formed
a
part
of
the
practical
life
of
jesus
or
been
realized
in
his
experience
this
is
a
more
charitable
and
honorable
explanation
of
the
matter
than
that
found
in
the
assumption
of
some
other
writers
that
every
miracle
was
constructed
for
the
occasion
that
it
is
a
sheer
fabrication
and
yet
there
are
some
plausible
grounds
for
this
solution
of
the
case
these
critical
writers
tell
us
there
was
a
religious
persuasion
deeply
enstamped
upon
the
minds
of
all
religious
countries
that
god
often
justified
a
departure
from
the
truth
the
conscientious
or
veracious
faculty
being
in
that
age
but
feebly
developed
and
the
bible
itself
is
full
of
evidence
to
establish
the
allegation
the
prophets
often
disclose
it
and
the
apostles
were
their
strict
imitators
ezekiel
represents
god
as
saying
if
a
prophet
is
deceived
i
the
lord
deceived
that
prophet
ezek
xiv
and
jeremiah
asks
god
wilt
thou
be
to
me
as
a
liar
jer
xv
while
the
writer
of
kings
represents
god
as
putting
a
lying
spirit
into
the
mouth
of
his
own
prophets
i
kings
xxii
and
most
certainly
if
god
himself
might
thus
habitually
depart
from
the
truth
it
was
an
ample
warrant
for
his
apostles
as
well
as
the
prophets
to
adopt
the
same
expedient
the
case
of
paul
lying
for
the
glory
of
god
which
we
have
cited
from
romans
iii
proves
they
were
morally
capable
of
doing
this
mosheim
tells
us
that
among
the
early
christians
it
was
an
almost
universally
adopted
maxim
that
it
was
an
act
of
virtue
to
deceive
and
lie
when
by
so
doing
they
could
promote
the
interest
of
the
church
mosh
vol
p
and
higgins
informs
us
that
great
numbers
of
every
age
and
of
every
religion
have
been
guilty
of
systematic
frauds
and
falsehoods
to
support
their
religions
to
an
extent
of
which
we
can
have
no
conception
they
not
only
practiced
it
but
they
reduced
it
to
system
they
avowed
it
and
they
justified
it
by
declaring
it
to
be
meritorious
to
lie
in
a
good
cause
ana
vol
p
the
reader
who
can
hesitate
to
credit
these
statements
only
betrays
his
ignorance
of
the
moral
weakness
of
human
nature
and
the
imperfect
growth
in
that
era
of
the
veracious
faculty
which
consequently
had
but
a
feeble
voice
in
the
councils
of
the
mind
even
the
most
pious
and
devout
professors
of
religion
did
not
consider
a
rigid
conformity
to
truth
necessary
or
morally
obligatory
in
their
labors
to
promote
the
glory
of
god
and
the
salvation
of
souls
and
when
direct
falsehood
was
not
resorted
to
the
writer
still
allowed
himself
to
color
magnify
and
invent
largely
that
is
to
draw
copiously
upon
the
resources
of
his
imagination
in
the
way
of
supplying
omissions
and
defects
and
filling
out
missing
links
in
the
chain
of
history
and
hence
it
is
that
all
ancient
sacred
history
is
so
profusely
inlaid
with
stories
and
statements
manifestly
fabricated
for
the
occasion
without
any
historical
support
and
therefore
wholly
incredible
let
the
christian
reader
not
however
misapprehend
us
by
supposing
we
wish
to
drive
him
to
the
extreme
alternative
of
accepting
this
as
the
true
explanation
or
as
indicating
the
real
origin
of
the
incredible
stories
and
senseless
miraculous
feats
interwoven
into
the
gospel
life
of
jesus
we
only
offer
it
as
a
plausible
but
not
as
the
probable
explanation
the
above
citations
from
the
scriptures
and
other
history
prove
most
clearly
that
sacred
writers
were
morally
capable
of
fabricating
or
manufacturing
history
to
supply
assumed
omissions
and
this
explanation
is
twofold
more
reasonable
than
to
accept
the
miracles
as
real
occurrences
for
such
a
belief
would
be
at
war
with
common
sense
and
prostrate
our
reason
beneath
our
feet
but
there
is
no
necessity
of
adopting
lying
hypotheses
while
the
borrowing
theory
is
amply
adequate
to
account
for
every
gospel
miracle
there
is
not
a
miraculous
story
or
incredible
legend
incorporated
in
the
new
testament
as
a
part
of
the
history
of
jesus
that
was
not
afloat
in
some
shape
or
form
on
the
wings
of
tradition
in
nearly
every
religious
country
ages
before
his
birth
the
model
for
each
and
every
miracle
was
already
constructed
was
already
in
the
market
and
already
a
part
of
the
history
or
tradition
of
other
and
older
gods
and
all
that
was
wanted
to
make
it
appear
as
a
part
of
the
history
of
the
christian
deified
jesus
was
to
fill
in
names
and
dates
yes
history
with
a
hundred
tongues
proclaims
it
as
the
real
explanation
of
the
incredible
and
the
impossible
in
the
history
of
jesus
christ
and
the
evidence
is
so
voluminous
and
so
overwhelming
to
disprove
the
common
christian
dogma
which
makes
the
son
of
joseph
and
mary
a
god
a
portion
of
which
we
have
presented
under
the
several
propositions
of
this
chapter
that
it
really
demolishes
the
last
timber
in
the
christian
fabric
and
leaves
it
a
heap
of
ruins
and
we
are
certain
that
if
we
could
divest
the
christian
reader
mind
for
a
few
moments
of
an
inherited
and
fostered
prejudice
he
would
see
that
our
explanation
is
much
more
rational
more
probable
more
beautiful
than
the
popular
belief
which
degrades
the
illustrious
judean
reformer
to
a
level
with
the
heathen
thaumaturgist
and
gives
him
the
same
undignified
reputation
as
a
but
we
are
sometimes
told
we
are
under
as
much
moral
obligation
to
believe
in
the
miracles
reported
of
jesus
as
to
believe
in
any
other
portion
of
his
history
that
we
must
accept
his
gospel
history
as
a
whole
or
reject
it
in
toto
but
this
is
manifestly
a
false
assumption
and
one
easily
exploded
no
person
who
is
acquainted
with
grecian
history
doubts
that
alexander
the
great
was
born
in
macedonia
and
founded
a
city
in
egypt
bearing
his
own
name
yet
not
one
of
those
readers
will
credit
for
a
moment
what
one
of
his
biographers
relates
of
him
that
he
stopped
the
sun
in
its
course
or
that
he
had
no
human
father
we
all
accept
pythagoras
as
a
real
entity
while
we
reject
the
story
of
his
walking
on
the
air
are
we
morally
bound
to
accept
romulus
and
remus
founders
of
rome
as
mere
fabulous
beings
because
their
biographers
relate
the
incredible
story
of
their
being
suckled
by
a
wolf
many
other
illustrations
might
be
given
in
proof
of
the
falsity
of
the
assumption
that
because
a
portion
of
a
man
biography
is
found
to
be
incredible
the
whole
must
be
rejected
as
false
as
unworthy
of
credence
this
would
be
to
annihilate
history
for
no
biography
of
any
person
and
no
history
of
any
nation
can
be
accepted
as
plenarily
pure
unmixed
truth
there
is
always
more
or
less
chaff
with
the
grain
and
it
is
our
privilege
and
our
duty
to
separate
them
and
by
so
doing
we
not
only
confer
a
favor
on
the
cause
of
truth
but
add
to
the
luster
and
honor
of
the
name
of
the
deceased
reformer
and
especially
is
this
true
of
the
renowned
judean
philanthropist
and
reformer
much
more
lovely
and
beautiful
would
his
evangelical
history
stand
before
the
world
if
stripped
of
the
wild
the
weird
and
the
miraculous
much
more
interesting
is
he
when
viewed
and
venerated
as
a
man
than
when
worshipped
as
a
god
guilty
of
the
frequent
violation
of
his
own
laws
by
the
display
of
the
power
and
much
more
beautiful
and
much
more
rational
is
the
doctrine
which
accepts
every
event
that
ever
occurred
as
the
legitimate
and
harmonious
operation
of
the
great
machinery
of
nature
than
as
the
smart
trick
the
lawless
caprice
or
wild
feat
of
an
arbitrary
god
performed
not
to
make
the
people
better
more
moral
or
more
righteous
for
miracles
can
not
do
this
but
merely
to
make
them
gape
and
stare
and
shout
what
a
smart
god
we
have
got
and
then
the
belief
in
miracles
involves
an
utter
repudiation
of
all
law
all
order
and
all
system
and
introduces
in
their
stead
chaos
anarchy
and
universal
confusion
it
is
simply
the
doctrine
of
chance
which
all
orthodox
christendom
professes
to
deprecate
and
execrate
as
the
quintessence
of
atheism
but
they
make
a
mistake
chance
is
more
legitimately
the
fruit
of
miracle
than
of
atheism
an
assertion
which
we
will
here
briefly
prove
if
the
sun
may
be
arrested
in
his
course
through
the
heavens
the
moon
turned
into
blood
and
the
stars
fall
from
the
heaven
sticks
turned
into
serpents
water
into
blood
and
dust
into
lice
all
of
which
orthodox
christians
profess
to
believe
were
witnessed
in
the
days
of
moses
and
christ
then
everything
is
thrown
upon
the
wheel
of
chance
everything
is
involved
in
uncertainty
if
the
course
of
nature
could
be
arrested
or
the
natural
qualities
of
objects
changed
by
the
prayer
of
a
prophet
patriarch
or
apostle
then
the
food
set
before
us
to
eat
may
suddenly
in
compliance
with
the
prayers
of
some
absent
saint
become
a
deadly
poison
the
clothes
we
wear
may
be
instantly
transformed
into
virulent
adders
which
may
inflict
the
fatal
sting
before
we
suspect
it
some
favorite
servant
of
god
a
moses
or
an
elijah
might
be
this
moment
praying
to
god
to
stop
the
dews
from
falling
or
the
rain
from
descending
for
the
next
three
months
or
three
years
as
the
latter
is
reported
as
doing
see
james
so
that
we
could
not
plant
with
any
certainty
that
the
seed
would
grow
or
that
we
should
be
rewarded
by
a
crop
such
would
be
the
incertitude
such
the
chance
against
us
in
everything
in
which
we
might
engage
if
it
were
true
that
god
ever
intercepts
the
action
of
his
laws
by
working
a
miracle
that
we
should
eventually
become
discouraged
by
this
chaos
of
chance
the
wheels
of
industry
would
stop
and
the
car
of
civilization
go
backward
if
it
were
true
as
taught
by
orthodox
christians
that
god
in
his
providence
or
god
in
the
dispensation
of
his
providence
often
visits
people
with
sickness
then
it
would
be
useless
to
study
the
laws
of
health
with
a
view
of
complying
with
them
for
we
could
not
know
in
any
case
whether
our
sickness
had
been
brought
upon
us
by
an
overruling
providence
or
by
our
own
imprudence
our
inventives
to
study
and
comply
with
these
laws
if
there
could
be
any
would
consequently
be
very
weak
indeed
for
we
might
comply
with
every
physiological
requisition
and
yet
there
would
be
several
chances
against
us
that
we
may
be
stretched
upon
a
sick
bed
and
rolling
pillow
by
the
visitation
of
god
thus
the
doctrine
of
miracles
is
shown
to
be
the
doctrine
of
chance
the
doctrine
of
miraculous
agency
makes
god
an
imperfect
being
by
implying
that
his
laws
were
defective
in
their
original
construction
that
by
mistake
he
left
some
emergency
unprovided
for
and
now
has
to
supply
the
omission
by
an
afterclap
exercise
of
power
or
if
his
laws
were
originally
perfect
then
the
working
of
a
miracle
would
disturb
them
and
make
them
imperfect
if
originally
imperfect
then
god
himself
must
have
been
imperfect
and
hence
no
god
at
all
think
of
a
wonderworking
god
violating
suspending
or
intercepting
his
own
laws
such
a
god
would
be
a
puerile
being
that
only
ignorant
and
uncultivated
minds
could
admire
and
adore
the
age
of
miracles
however
is
gone
the
belief
in
divine
prodigies
has
receded
before
the
advancing
genius
of
civilization
it
has
died
away
in
the
exact
ratio
of
the
progress
of
science
and
general
intelligence
and
a
thorough
acquaintance
with
nature
laws
will
banish
the
last
vestige
of
such
a
belief
hence
it
is
that
the
most
illiterate
and
ignorant
nations
and
tribes
have
always
been
able
to
recount
the
longest
list
of
miraculous
prodigies
achieved
by
a
disorderly
god
who
seems
to
have
taken
pleasure
in
violating
his
own
laws
or
suspending
them
for
the
most
trivial
purposes
yes
the
time
is
approaching
when
the
belief
in
a
miraculous
interposition
or
special
providences
must
pass
away
under
the
lights
of
science
and
civilization
and
be
numbered
amongst
the
things
which
have
been
and
can
be
no
more
and
men
will
cherish
more
noble
and
elevated
ideas
of
the
great
ruler
of
the
universe
who
is
infinite
in
order
infinite
in
wisdom
ay
infinite
in
all
his
attributes
and
virtues
ever
unchangeably
the
same
ii
prophecy
the
second
pillar
of
the
christian
faith
proves
as
much
for
heathenism
and
spiritualism
truthful
prophecy
attested
to
be
such
by
its
fulfillment
is
assumed
to
be
one
of
the
basic
pillars
and
one
of
the
main
proofs
of
the
truth
of
the
christian
religion
but
the
following
consideration
will
show
that
this
assumption
has
no
logical
force
or
real
tangible
foundation
first
every
ancient
system
of
religion
had
its
prophets
and
seers
who
professed
to
be
able
to
foresee
events
of
the
future
and
we
find
but
little
difference
in
the
proofs
each
one
has
left
to
the
world
that
they
possessed
this
power
if
we
except
the
greeks
and
romans
some
of
whom
evidently
excelled
all
the
jewish
prophets
in
their
ability
to
take
cognizance
of
events
lying
behind
the
curtain
of
time
tacitus
the
latin
historian
prophesied
the
downfall
of
the
roman
empire
and
its
attendant
calamities
more
than
five
hundred
years
before
its
occurrence
which
was
fulfilled
to
the
letter
and
solon
one
of
the
seven
wise
men
of
greece
foresaw
and
foretold
a
series
of
calamities
which
befell
the
athenians
two
hundred
years
before
they
were
realized
a
still
more
remarkable
example
is
furnished
in
the
history
of
marcus
tullius
cicero
who
writing
of
the
future
with
his
mind
fixed
on
the
west
about
exclaimed
there
will
arise
after
many
ages
if
we
may
credit
the
sibylline
oracles
a
hero
who
will
deliver
his
oppressed
countrymen
from
bondage
a
prophecy
most
signally
fulfilled
in
the
life
of
general
washington
many
other
examples
of
heathen
prophecy
and
their
fulfillment
might
be
cited
if
we
had
space
for
them
second
the
history
of
modern
spiritualism
furnishes
many
cases
of
future
events
being
predicted
long
before
they
took
place
in
fact
many
of
the
most
important
events
of
modern
times
which
have
occurred
in
this
and
other
countries
were
foreseen
and
foretold
by
spiritual
seers
known
as
seeing
mediums
when
there
was
not
the
slightest
probability
that
such
events
would
ever
occur
we
will
cite
one
or
two
cases
by
way
of
proof
and
illustration
a
few
years
ago
john
coles
of
new
york
known
as
a
spiritual
medium
prophesied
when
under
spirit
control
that
nicholas
of
russia
would
shortly
have
difficulty
with
his
secretary
menzicoff
and
just
three
months
from
that
time
would
die
a
prediction
that
was
fulfilled
to
the
very
letter
and
to
the
very
hour
and
yet
there
was
not
the
slightest
probability
externally
indicated
at
the
time
the
prophecy
was
uttered
that
either
of
these
events
would
ever
be
realized
and
this
prophecy
let
it
be
noted
was
published
in
the
new
york
times
at
least
two
months
before
it
was
verified
thus
proving
that
the
prediction
was
not
an
afterclap
affair
but
preceded
the
event
take
another
example
the
serious
calamity
which
befell
the
steamer
known
as
the
arctic
which
was
lost
at
sea
a
number
of
years
ago
with
all
on
board
was
prophetically
described
in
minute
detail
by
a
spirit
medium
several
months
before
it
occurred
and
was
seen
and
described
by
another
medium
while
taking
place
more
than
a
thousand
miles
distant
the
proof
is
at
our
command
and
the
late
disastrous
war
was
foreseen
and
described
by
cora
tappan
of
new
york
and
other
mediums
and
its
principal
events
pointed
out
long
before
the
war
broke
out
a
fact
which
is
now
a
matter
of
history
these
are
only
a
few
cases
out
of
hundreds
that
might
be
cited
of
a
similar
character
drawn
from
the
practical
history
of
modern
spiritualism
if
then
prophecy
can
do
anything
toward
the
truth
or
divine
emanation
of
the
christian
religion
it
must
do
the
same
for
the
heathen
and
spiritual
systems
and
thus
proving
too
much
it
proves
nothing
at
all
third
the
jewish
prophecies
not
fulfilled
we
have
examined
critically
the
various
texts
of
the
christian
bible
called
prophecies
and
find
that
if
claimed
as
predictions
of
the
future
events
beyond
the
powers
of
the
natural
mind
to
foresee
they
have
all
failed
but
few
of
them
have
been
fulfilled
in
any
sense
and
those
few
required
no
divine
prescience
to
foresee
the
result
many
events
have
transpired
in
every
country
which
the
natural
sagacity
of
the
most
observant
minds
in
that
country
had
anticipated
as
the
result
of
natural
causes
such
as
the
ravages
and
downfall
of
cities
and
the
overthrow
of
empires
by
the
merciless
hand
of
war
the
jewish
prophet
fostering
a
spirit
of
envy
and
enmity
towards
egypt
babylon
and
other
superior
kingdoms
because
they
had
been
overpowered
by
them
and
long
held
in
subjection
to
their
superior
sway
were
always
prophesying
evil
things
of
these
principalities
and
though
some
of
the
evils
which
constituted
the
burden
of
prophecy
might
have
been
reasonably
anticipated
as
natural
occurrences
it
is
a
signal
fact
they
never
transpired
at
all
such
as
the
total
destruction
of
babylon
tyre
damascus
and
other
cities
belonging
to
those
hostile
kingdoms
the
jews
so
much
envied
and
execrated
look
for
proof
at
the
case
of
damascus
the
prophets
isaiah
jeremiah
and
ezekiel
all
poured
out
their
fulminatory
thunders
upon
this
city
isaiah
declared
it
should
be
a
ruinous
heap
isa
xvii
i
and
jeremiah
predicted
its
destruction
by
fire
jer
xlix
and
yet
notwithstanding
these
predictions
of
ruin
damascus
still
stands
as
one
of
the
paradises
of
the
earth
as
one
writer
styles
it
with
a
population
according
to
burckhart
of
not
less
than
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
being
one
of
the
most
magnificent
and
prosperous
commercial
cities
on
the
globe
instead
of
being
blotted
out
of
existence
as
the
jewish
prophets
prayed
and
predicted
it
has
suffered
less
by
ravages
of
war
and
the
scythe
of
time
than
almost
any
other
city
of
the
east
it
has
stood
nearly
three
thousand
years
without
becoming
a
ruinous
heap
or
being
consumed
by
fire
or
destroyed
by
war
jer
xlix
and
the
prophecy
against
tyre
has
most
signally
failed
also
ezekiel
declared
it
should
be
destroyed
by
nebuchadnezzar
and
never
be
found
again
ezek
but
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
after
nebuchadnezzar
time
alexander
found
it
a
strong
commercial
city
and
it
still
contains
a
population
of
five
thousand
or
more
jerome
of
the
fourth
century
declared
it
to
be
then
the
finest
city
of
phoenicia
and
was
astonished
that
ezekiel
prophecy
had
so
utterly
failed
and
isaiah
famous
prediction
against
babylon
furnishes
another
proof
of
the
utter
failure
of
jewish
prophecy
he
declared
after
predicting
its
destruction
it
shall
never
be
inhabited
neither
shall
it
be
dwelt
in
from
generation
to
generation
neither
shall
the
arabian
pitch
tent
there
isa
xiii
of
course
he
desired
it
should
be
so
but
unfortunately
for
his
credit
as
a
prophet
it
never
suffered
such
a
calamity
on
the
contrary
according
to
layard
and
rawlinson
british
commissioners
who
recently
visited
the
place
it
now
presents
all
the
activity
of
a
hive
of
bees
to
use
layard
language
and
contains
several
thousand
inhabitants
though
its
name
is
since
rebuilt
called
hillah
and
thus
the
prophecy
is
falsified
no
exclaims
a
good
christian
brother
in
forlorn
hope
it
may
be
fulfilled
yet
but
if
he
will
examine
the
language
of
the
prophecy
he
will
find
he
is
entirely
cut
off
from
this
saving
clause
the
prophet
says
her
time
is
near
to
come
and
her
days
shall
not
be
prolonged
isa
xiii
thus
it
is
evident
the
prophecy
was
to
be
fulfilled
in
that
age
and
generation
the
failure
then
is
absolute
and
indisputable
and
these
are
but
mere
samples
of
the
complete
failure
of
every
text
called
a
prophecy
when
applied
to
the
prognostication
of
future
events
numerous
texts
can
be
found
in
the
prophets
auguring
evil
for
egypt
which
have
made
no
approximation
toward
fulfillment
ezekiel
prophesied
the
fall
of
egypt
the
desolation
of
egypt
the
destruction
of
egypt
not
one
of
which
calamities
has
ever
been
realized
in
her
experience
prophecies
respecting
the
restoration
of
the
lost
tribes
and
the
perpetuity
of
the
israelitish
throne
are
complete
failures
also
all
the
messianic
prophecies
so
called
see
chap
ii
with
respect
to
the
prophecy
on
babylon
it
may
be
further
observed
that
while
the
prophet
declares
neither
shall
the
arabian
pitch
tent
there
isa
xiii
layard
declares
that
is
the
very
thing
they
did
do
while
he
was
there
he
says
he
saw
a
number
of
arabian
tents
pitched
on
the
ground
thus
proving
a
failure
of
the
prophecy
all
round
in
every
particular
see
note
page
fourth
the
bible
itself
is
a
witness
that
truthful
prophecy
can
do
nothing
toward
authenticating
a
religion
or
toward
proving
the
prophet
divinely
inspired
the
same
damaging
concession
is
made
here
as
in
the
case
of
miracles
that
a
heathen
and
an
unbeliever
could
and
did
succeed
as
well
as
the
true
disciples
of
the
faith
the
proof
of
this
statement
is
found
in
the
history
of
balaam
his
figurative
representation
of
a
star
coming
out
of
jacob
and
a
scepter
out
of
judah
see
numb
chap
xxiv
is
often
quoted
by
christian
writers
as
presaging
or
prefiguring
the
coming
of
christ
thus
making
a
heathen
and
an
unbeliever
the
oracle
of
a
messianic
prophecy
and
a
heathen
too
of
sinful
and
ungodly
habits
so
that
the
christian
subterfuge
is
not
available
here
that
god
might
make
a
righteous
man
of
any
nation
the
vehicle
of
prophecy
for
we
have
the
express
declaration
of
the
bible
itself
that
he
was
not
a
righteous
man
but
the
very
reverse
peter
tells
us
he
loved
the
wages
of
unrighteousness
at
the
very
time
this
prophecy
so
called
was
uttered
see
peter
ii
which
prostrates
forever
the
christian
plea
the
he
might
have
possessed
the
true
spirit
of
prophecy
by
virtue
of
being
a
righteous
man
and
drives
us
to
the
admission
that
an
unconverted
savage
and
ungodly
heathen
unbeliever
could
make
a
true
prophecy
it
not
being
necessary
then
to
be
a
jew
or
a
christian
or
a
believer
or
even
a
moral
man
to
foresee
or
foretell
the
important
events
of
the
future
the
argument
falls
forever
to
the
ground
that
the
fulfillment
of
the
jewish
prophecies
if
admitted
to
have
been
fulfilled
could
do
anything
toward
proving
the
truth
or
divine
acceptance
of
the
religion
of
the
bible
or
its
superiority
over
any
heathen
or
oriental
religion
then
or
subsequently
known
to
history
as
they
all
present
the
same
evidence
of
being
endowed
with
the
true
spirit
of
prophecy
all
argument
for
christianity
based
on
the
prophecies
or
the
gift
of
prophecy
is
then
forever
at
an
end
as
it
has
been
shown
that
the
power
to
foretell
future
events
is
not
restricted
by
the
bible
itself
to
any
nation
to
any
religion
to
any
faith
to
any
belief
or
to
any
moral
or
religious
qualification
what
then
is
prophecy
worth
or
what
does
it
prove
another
case
and
one
similar
to
that
of
balaam
in
its
essential
points
is
found
in
the
new
testament
caiaphas
though
not
claiming
to
be
any
part
of
a
believer
utters
a
prophecy
in
the
interest
of
the
christian
religion
for
which
the
bible
itself
gives
him
full
credit
as
a
prophet
here
then
is
another
case
of
a
heathen
stealing
the
christian
thunder
and
another
proof
that
the
spirit
of
true
prophecy
has
never
been
confined
to
any
nation
or
any
religion
and
hence
according
to
the
teachings
of
the
bible
itself
does
nothing
at
all
toward
establishing
the
exalted
claims
of
christianity
or
toward
proving
its
superiority
over
other
systems
of
religion
iii
moral
precepts
the
third
pillar
of
the
christian
faith
it
is
declared
in
view
of
the
many
wise
precepts
which
issued
from
the
mouth
of
jesus
christ
that
he
spake
as
never
man
spake
john
vii
if
this
were
true
then
gods
must
have
been
very
numerous
prior
to
the
christian
era
for
there
is
not
one
of
the
moral
maxims
or
preceptive
commands
which
he
gave
utterance
to
that
can
not
be
found
literally
or
substantially
in
the
older
bibles
of
other
nations
or
the
writings
of
the
greek
philosophers
and
the
religious
dissertations
of
heathen
moralists
who
gave
out
moral
and
religious
lessons
for
the
instruction
of
the
world
long
prior
to
the
birth
of
christ
even
the
golden
rule
which
christian
writers
ignorant
or
oriental
history
have
erroneously
ascribed
to
jesus
christ
and
lauded
him
as
being
the
author
of
is
found
variously
expressed
in
the
writings
of
several
heathen
or
oriental
nations
we
find
it
in
the
chinese
bible
at
least
live
hundred
years
older
than
ours
almost
word
for
word
as
jesus
uttered
it
we
will
here
present
it
as
expressed
by
different
writers
golden
rule
by
confucius
do
unto
another
what
you
would
have
him
do
unto
you
and
do
not
to
another
what
you
would
not
have
him
do
unto
you
thou
needest
this
law
alone
it
is
the
foundation
of
all
the
rest
golden
rule
by
aristotle
we
should
conduct
ourselves
toward
others
as
we
would
have
them
act
toward
us
golden

by
pittacus

golden

golden

by
aristippus
cherish
reciprocal
benevolence
which
will
make
you
as
anxious
for
another
welfare
as
your
own
golden
rule
by
sextus
a
pythagorean
what
you
wish
your
neighbors
to
be
to
you
such
be
also
to
them
golden
rule
by
hillel
do
not
to
others
what
you
would
not
like
others
to
do
to
you
here
is
the
golden
rule
proclaimed
by
seven
heathen
moralists
and
a
jew
long
before
it
was
republished
by
the
founder
of
christianity
thus
proving
it
to
be
of
heathen
origin
and
proving
that
it
does
not
transcend
the
natural
capacity
of
the
human
brain
to
originate
and
hence
needs
no
god
to
reveal
it
indeed
it
is
one
of
the
most
natural
sentiments
of
the
human
mind
would
i
like
to
be
treated
thus
is
the
first
thought
which
naturally
arises
in
the
mind
of
a
person
when
maltreating
a
neighbor
thus
showing
that
the
golden
rule
is
a
spontaneous
utterance
of
the
moral
feelings
of
the
human
mind
love
and
kind
treatment
of
enemies
love
to
enemies
is
considered
to
be
another
praiseworthy
precept
which
christ
has
erroneously
the
credit
of
being
the
author
of
we
have
heard
the
declaration
made
in
the
christian
pulpit
that
jesus
christ
was
the
first
moral
teacher
who
inculcated
love
to
enemies
a
most
transcendent
error
as
the
following
historical
citations
will
show
most
of
the
religious
books
and
religious
teachers
of
the
ancient
oriental
heathen
breathe
forth
a
spirit
of
love
and
kindness
toward
enemies
the
following
is
from
the
old
persian
bible
the
sadder
forgive
thy
foes
nor
that
alone
their
evil
deeds
with
good
repay
fill
those
with
joy
who
leave
thee
none
and
kiss
the
hand
upraised
to
slay
the
christian
bible
would
be
searched
in
vain
to
find
a
moral
sentiment
or
precept
superior
to
this
certainly
it
is
the
loftiest
sentiment
of
kindness
toward
enemies
that
ever
issued
from
human
lips
or
was
ever
penned
by
mortal
man
and
yet
it
is
found
in
an
old
heathen
bible
think
of
kissing
the
hand
upraised
to
slay
never
was
love
and
kindness
and
forbearance
toward
enemies
more
sublimely
expressed
than
in
the
old
persian
ballad
treat
thine
enemy
as
though
a
friend
and
he
will
become
thy

christian
religion

many
have
erroneously
supposed
but
is
unquestionably
a
natural
sentiment
of
the
moral
instinct
or
moral
impulses
of
the
human
mind
and
hence
is
no
proof
that
their
teacher
is
either
a
god
or
divinely
inspired
and
we
have
in
our
possession
nearly
eight
hundred
more
precepts
see
vol
ii
from
the
pens
or
mouths
of
the
ancient
heathen
enjoining
just
and
kind
treatment
of
women
and
setting
forth
nearly
all
the
duties
of
life
and
teaching
the
immortality
of
the
soul
and
these
precepts
breathe
the
same
lofty
moral
sentiment
and
moral
feeling
as
those
quoted
above
how
ignorant
and
how
conceited
must
be
the
christian
professor
who
supposes
all
goodness
is
confined
to
christianity
or
that
it
even
possesses
any
great
superiority
over
other
religious
systems
and
how
completely
the
three
foregoing
parts
of
this
chapter
miracles
prophecies
and
precepts
prostrate
the
divine
claims
of
christianity
and
leave
not
an
inch
of
ground
for
them
to
rest
upon
chapter
xxxv
logical
or
common
sense
view
of
the
doctrine
of
divine
incarnation
the
incarnation
of
an
infinite
god
is
a
shocking
absurdity
and
an
infinite
impossibility
we
ask
in
all
solemn
earnestness
and
in
the
name
of
the
intuitive
monitions
of
an
unshackled
reason
and
an
unbiased
conscience
can
any
man
in
his
sober
senses
who
has
been
in
the
habit
of
reflecting
before
he
believes
entertain
for
a
moment
the
monstrous
absurdity
that
the
almighty
and
infinite
maker
of
the
universe
was
once
reduced
to
a
little
wailing
infant
lying
in
senseless
and
helpless
weakness
on
the
lap
of
its
mother
unable
to
walk
a
step
or
lisp
a
word
or
do
aught
but
cry
with
pain
or
for
nourishment
stored
in
the
mother
breast
what
almighty
god
fallen
from
his
burnished
dazzling
throne
in
the
lofty
heavens
and
reduced
to
helpless
senseless
babyhood
omnipotence
shorn
of
all
power
but
to
breathe
and
cry
and
smile
what
that
omniscient
being
who
leads
one
world
by
day
and
ten
thousand
more
by
night
becoming
suddenly
transformed
into
a
human
bantling
which
knows
no
higher
enjoyment
that
that
of
being
pleased
with
a
rattle
and
tickled
with
a
straw
who
can
believe
it
ay
who
dare
believe
it
if
he
would
escape
the
charge
of
blasphemy
then
say
not
that
the
man
christ
jesus
though
standing
at
the
top
of
the
ladder
of
moral
manhood
and
high
above
the
common
plane
of
humanity
was
yet
a
god
the
infinite
ruler
of
the
infinite
universe
who
can
believe
that
that
being
whose
existence
stretches
to
an
eternity
beyond
human
conception
yea
whom
the
heaven
of
heavens
can
not
contain
was
ever
cooped
up
in
a
human
body
reduced
so
near
to
nothing
in
dimensions
as
to
be
susceptible
as
was
jesus
of
being
weighed
in
scales
and
measured
with
a
yardstick
we
ask
again
who
from
the
deepest
depths
of
his
inmost
enlightened
consciousness
can
believe
such
revolting
such
atheistical
doctrine
as
this
or
who
will
venture
to
descend
still
lower
and
conceive
of
an
almighty
omnipresent
being
who
fills
all
space
above
around
and
beneath
from
infinity
below
to
yon
fixed
star
above
and
millions
upon
millions
of
miles
beyond
it
sinking
and
dwindling
to
that
mere
mite
speck
or
monad
state
and
condition
comprehended
in
the
initiatory
step
of
embryonic
existence
and
then
think
of
the
almighty
omnipotent
creator
of
the
universe
lying
in
a
manger
with
beasts
and
creeping
things
sleeping
with
oxen
and
asses
in
a
stable
next
he
is
seen
an
urchin
on
the
street
playing
with
marbles
and
absorbed
and
forgetful
of
the
world
around
him
who
can
believe
that
awfully
majestic
being
who
is
represented
by
his
own
inspired
book
as
being
so
transcendently
grand
and
that
no
man
san
see
him
and
live
ex
xxxiii
was
not
only
daily
seen
by
hundreds
and
thousands
but
was
on
such
familiar
terms
with
men
that
they
regarded
him
as
their
companion
and
equal
and
even
sometimes
coolly
reprimanded
him
for
supposed
misdemeanors
and
errors
could
they
believe
this
to
be
almighty
god
impossible
impossible
and
then
who
can
believe
that
that
infinite
being
whom
we
have
been
taught
to
regard
as
absolutely
and
eternally
unchangeable
could
become
subject
to
hunger
and
thirst
as
did
jesus
or
who
can
believe
that
the
eternally
and
unceasingly
watchful
omnipotent
deity
whose
eye
we
are
told
never
slumbers
could
sink
into
unconscious
sleep
become
to
dumb
forgetfulness
a
prey
night
after
night
for
thirty
years
oblivious
and
unconscious
of
the
world
around
him
think
of
a
being
of
incomprehensible
majesty
dignity
and
power
able
to
shake
the
heavens
and
the
earth
also
being
unable
to
protect
himself
from
insult
and
was
therefore
derided
and
spit
upon
and
finally
overcome
by
his
enemies
as
is
related
of
jesus
can
any
man
believe
who
has
not
made
shipwreck
of
his
senses
or
banished
reason
from
her
courts
that
god
who
comprehends
in
himself
the
most
absolute
and
boundless
perfection
of
goodness
and
wisdom
was
tempted
by
demons
devils
and
crawling
serpents
who
can
believe
that
the
lord
who
owns
the
cattle
upon
a
thousand
hills
psalm
io
and
the
countless
host
of
worlds
besides
that
wheel
their
course
through
infinite
space
had
not
where
to
lay
his
head
who
can
believe
that
that
was
the
omnipotent
and
omnipresent
god
possessing
all
power
in
heaven
above
and
the
earth
beneath
who
was
betrayed
by
weak
finite
mortals
what
the
almighty
creator
betrayed
by
a
puny
being
of
his
own
creation
into
the
hands
of
his
disobedient
and
rebellious
children
why
could
he
not
if
possessing
power
to
lay
down
his
life
and
take
it
up
again
john
x
cause
that
all
these
children
of
his
as
we
must
assume
they
were
if
he
was
almighty
god
and
hence
the
father
of
all
should
love
him
instead
of
hating
him
can
any
man
believe
that
jesus
was
possessed
with
omnipotent
power
while
standing
to
be
whipped
scourged
by
pontius
pilate
or
that
he
possessed
a
power
above
that
of
finite
mortals
while
in
the
act
of
praying
with
such
extreme
ardor
that
the
sweat
dropped
from
his
face
that
the
cup
of
death
might
pass
from
his
lips
or
while
calling
for
an
angel
to
support
him
in
the
hour
of
his
mortal
dissolution
or
that
he
by
whom
all
things
exist
could
cease
himself
to
exist
by
dying
upon
the
cross
between
malefactors
think
of
this
reader
and
think
of
the
eternal
creator
the
infinite
deity
the
omnipotent
jehovah
the
maker
of
worlds
as
numberless
as
the
sands
upon
the
for
multitude
fainting
bleeding
dying
and
pouring
out
his
own
blood
to
appease
his
own
wrath
dying
an
ignominious
death
to
satisfy
an
implacable
revenge
away
with
such
insulting
mockery
such
blasphemous
flummery
it
can
only
find
place
in
the
dark
chambers
of
an
unenlightened
mind
well
has
watts
said
of
locke
skepticism
reason
could
scarcely
sustain
to
see
or
bear
the
infant
deity
a
ransomed
world
a
bleeding
god
and
heaven
appeased
by
flowing
blood
were
themes
too
painful
to
be
understood
yes
and
too
painful
to
be
believed
too
watts
here
we
have
a
bleeding
god
an
infant
deity
and
a
vengeful
god
appeased
by
murder
and
streams
of
flowing
blood
gracious
heavens
whose
reason
does
not
revolt
at
such
a
picture
whose
soul
does
not
sicken
at
the
thought
and
who
would
not
prefer
infinitely
prefer
to
sink
to
annihilation
if
not
to
perdition
itself
to
being
thus
saved
by
navigating
a
river
of
blood
south
hits
off
some
of
the
absurdities
involved
in
the
christian
doctrine
of
the
incarnation
so
forcibly
and
so
lucidly
that
we
can
not
resist
the
temptation
to
subjoin
a
few
extracts
from
his
sermon
on
the
subject
but
now
says
this
christian
clergyman
was
there
ever
any
wonder
comparable
to
this
to
behold
the
lord
jesus
christ
thus
clothed
in
flesh
the
creator
of
all
things
humbled
not
only
to
the
company
but
also
to
the
cognation
of
his
creatures
it
is
as
if
one
should
imagine
the
whole
world
not
only
represented
upon
but
also
contained
in
one
of
our
own
artificial
globes
or
the
body
of
the
sun
enveloped
in
a
cloud
as
big
as
a
hand
all
of
which
would
be
looked
upon
as
astonishing
impossibilities
and
yet
is
as
short
of
the
other
as
the
finite
is
of
the
infinite
between
which
the
disparity
is
immeasurable
it
is
as
it
were
to
cancel
the
essential
distances
of
things
to
remove
the
bounds
of
nature
to
bring
heaven
and
earth
and
what
is
more
both
ends
of
the
contradiction
together
men
can
not
persuade
themselves
that
a
deity
and
infinity
should
lie
within
so
narrow
a
compass
as
the
dimensions
of
a
human
body
that
omnipotence
omnipresence
should
ever
be
wrapped
in
swaddling
clothes
and
debased
to
the
homely
usages
of
a
stable
and
a
manger
that
the
glorious
artificer
of
the
whole
universe
who
spread
out
the
heaven
like
a
curtain
and
laid
the
foundations
of
the
earth
could
ever
turn
carpenter
and
exercise
an
inglorious
trade
in
a
little
cell
they
can
not
imagine
that
he
who
once
created
and
at
present
governs
the
world
and
shall
hereafter
judge
the
world
should
be
abased
in
all
his
concerns
and
relations
be
scourged
spit
upon
mocked
and
at
last
crucified
all
which
are
passages
which
lie
extremely
close
to
the
notions
of
conceptions
which
reason
has
made
to
itself
of
that
high
and
impossible
perfection
that
resided
in
the
divine
creator
sermon
south
it
will
be
observed
admits
that
the
doctrine
of
the
divine
incarnation
involves
many
palpable
absurdities
and
contradictions
and
lies
directly
across
the
path
of
reason
fatal
admission
to
the
doctrine
of
the
deityship
of
christ
but
true
as
his
own
elucidation
of
the
subject
demonstrates
to
the
author
since
he
first
subjected
the
question
to
a
logical
scrutiny
and
looked
at
it
with
an
unbiased
mind
it
presents
difficulties
insurmountable
and
absurdities
innumerable
he
can
imagine
nothing
more
transcendently
shocking
revolting
and
dwarfing
to
the
mind
both
morally
and
intellectually
than
the
thought
of
believing
that
a
being
born
of
and
suckled
by
a
woman
and
possessing
the
mere
form
and
dimensions
of
a
man
can
be
regarded
as
the
great
almighty
and
omnipotent
god
the
creator
of
unnumbered
worlds
millions
of
which
are
larger
than
this
planet
on
which
jesus
was
born
and
then
reader
look
for
a
moment
at
some
of
the
many
childish
incongruities
and
logical
difficulties
this
giant
absurdity
drags
with
it
it
represents
almighty
god
as
coming
into
the
world
through
the
hands
of
a
midwife
as
passing
through
the
process
of
gestation
and
parturition
it
insults
our
reason
with
the
idea
that
the
great
infinite
jehovah
could
be
molded
into
the
human
form
a
thought
that
is
shocking
to
the
moral
sense
and
withering
cramping
and
dwarfing
to
the
intellectual
mind
imposing
upon
it
a
heavy
which
checks
its
expansion
and
forbids
its
onward
progress
christians
tell
us
that
the
human
and
the
divine
were
united
in
the
man
christ
jesus
but
this
is
a
monstrous
absurdity
which
no
truly
rational
and
unbiased
mind
can
accept
for
an
instant
that
of
hitching
splicing
tying
or
dovetailing
together
finite
man
with
the
infinite
jehovah
that
of
amalgamating
and
commingling
human
foibles
with
divine
perfection
think
of
wedding
mortal
weakness
to
omnipotent
power
local
man
with
the
omnipresent
deity
think
of
compounding
the
creature
and
the
creator
in
one
and
the
same
being
think
of
the
omnipresent
i
am
whose
illimitable
existence
stretches
far
away
throughout
the
expansive
arena
of
a
boundless
universe
occupying
a
dwelling
within
the
narrow
confines
of
the
human
temple
as
well
essay
to
crowd
the
universe
into
your
pocket
or
the
himalayas
mountains
into
a
thimble
on
the
other
hand
think
of
a
small
compound
of
flesh
blood
and
bones
a
few
feet
in
dimensions
and
weighing
perhaps
not
more
than
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
avoirdupois
containing
that
infinite
omnipresent
being
whom
we
are
told
we
repeat
the
quotation
the
heaven
of

can
not
contain
and
more
than
all
kind
reader
i
ask
you
if
you
can
accept
for
a
moment
without
the
immolation
of
your
common
sense
and
the
trampling
of
your
reason
beneath
you
feet
the
monstrous
thought
that
that
mighty
and
almighty
architect
who
who
created
the
countless
myriads
upon
myriads
of
ponderous
worlds
which
now
roll
in
majestic
order
and
eternal
rotation
along
the
great
cerulean
causeway
of
heaven
that
mighty
architect
who
from
time
beyond
human
computation
has
been
rolling
out
orb
after
orb
world
after
world
if
not
myriads
at
a
time
ten
thousand
times
ten
thousand
of
which
would
dwindle
our
little
pygmy
lilliputian
planet
into
insignificance
if
compared
with
it
in
size
i
ask
and
drive
home
the
query
to
your
inward
consciousness
and
the
inmost
temples
of
your
sacred
reason
can
you
believe
after
a
moment
reflection
that
a
being
who
is
too
vast
infinitely
too
vast
in
power
and
ubiquity
to
be
grasped
by
the
human
understanding
did
become
as
did
the
finite
and
humble
jesus
a

philosophical
absurdities
of
the
doctrine
of
the
divine
incarnation
there
is
a
philosophical
principle
underlying
the
doctrine
of
the
divine
incarnation
whose
logical
deductions
completely
overthrow
the
claim
of
jesus
of
nazareth
to
the
godhead
and
which
we
regard
as
settling
the
question
as
conclusively
as
any
demonstrated
problem
in
mathematics
this
argument
is
predicated
upon
the
philosophical
axiom
that
two
infinite
beings
of
any
description
of
conception
can
not
exist
either
in
whole
or
in
part
at
the
same
time
and
per
consequence
it
is
impossible
that
the
father
and
son
should
both
be
god
in
a
divine
sense
either
conjointly
or
separately
the
word
infinite
comprehends
all
it
covers
the
whole
ground
it
fills
the
immensity
of
the
universe
and
fills
it
to
repletion
so
that
there
is
no
room
left
for
any
other
being
to
exist
and
whoever
and
whatever
does
exist
must
constitute
a
part
of
this
infinite
whole
now
the
christian
world
concedes
for
it
is
the
teaching
of
their
scriptures
that
the
father
is
god
always
and
truly
perfect
complete
and
absolute
that
there
is
nothing
wanting
in
him
to
constitute
him
god
in
the
most
comprehensive
and
absolute
sense
of
the
term
that
he
is
all
we
can
conceive
of
as
constituting
god
the
one
only
true
god
john
xvii
and
was
such
from
all
eternity
before
jesus
christ
was
born
into
the
world
and
paul
puts
the
keystone
into
the
arch
by
proclaiming
to
us
there
is
but
one
god
the
father
cor
viii
hence
we
have
here
a
logical
proposition
despite
the
sophistry
of
christendom
as
impregnable
as
the
rocks
of
gibraltar
that
the
father
alone
is
or
can
be
god
which
effectually
shuts
out
every
other
and
all
other
beings
in
the
universe
from
any
participation
in
the
godhead
with
the
father
and
thus
this
parity
of
reasoning
demonstrates
that
the
very
moment
you
attempt
to
make
christ
god
or
any
part
of
the
godhead
you
attempt
a
philosophical
impossibility
you
can
not
introduce
another
being
as
god
in
the
infinite
sense
until
the
infinite
god
is
dethroned
and
put
out
of
existence
and
this
of
course
is
a
impossibility
it
it
were
not
such
then
we
should
have
two
gods
both
absolute
and
infinite
on
the
other
hand
if
that
other
being
who
with
the
christians
is
jesus
christ
with
the
hindoos
chrishna
with
the
budhists
sakia
is
introduced
as
only
a
part
of
the
infinite
and
perfect
god
then
it
is
evident
to
every
mind
with
the
least
philosophical
perception
that
some
change
or
alteration
must
take
place
in
the
latter
before
such
a
union
can
be
effected
but
such
a
change
or
any
alteration
in
a
perfect
infinite
being
would
at
once
reduce
him
to
a
changeable
and
finite
being
and
thus
he
would
cease
to
be
god
for
it
is
a
clear
philosophical
and
mathematical
axiom
that
a
perfect
and
infinite
being
can
not
become
more
than
infinite
and
if
he
could
and
should
become
less
than
infinite
he
would
at
once
become
finite
and
thus
lose
all
the
attributes
of
the
godhead
to
say
or
assume
then
that
christ
was
god
in
the
absolute
or
divine
sense
and
the
father
also
god
absolute
and
yet
that
there
is
but
one
god
or
that
the
two
could
in
any
manner
be
united
so
as
to
constitute
but
one
god
is
not
only
a
glaring
solecism
but
a
positive
contradiction
in
terms
and
an
utter
violation
of
the
first
axiomatic
principles
of
philosophy
and
mathematics
it
also
asserts
the
illogical
hypothesis
that
a
part
can
be
equal
to
the
whole
it
first
assumes
the
father
to
be
absolutely
god
then
assumes
the
son
also
to
be
absolutely
god
and
finally
assumes
each
to
be
only
a
part
and
has
to
unite
them
to
make
whole
and
culminates
the
theological
farce
such
is
christian
ratiocination
again
it
is
conceded
by
christians
that
the
father
is
an
omnipresent
being
and
we
have
shown
that
it
is
a
mathematical
impossibility
for
two
omnipresent
beings
or
two
beings
possessing
any
infinite
attributes
to
exist
at
one
and
the
same
time
hence
the
clear
logical
deducsequence
not
god
again
we
have
another
philosophical
maxim
or
axiom
familiar
to
every
schoolboy
that
no
two
substances
or
beings
can
occupy
the
same
place
at
the
same
time
the
first
must
be
removed
before
the
second
can
by
any
possibility
be
introduced
in
order
thus
to
make
room
for
the
latter
but
as
omnipresent
means
existing
everywhere
there
can
be
no
place
to
remove
on
omnipresent
being
to
or
rather
there
can
be
no
place
or
space
he
can
be
withdrawn
from
in
order
to
make
room
for
another
being
without
his
ceasing
to
be
omnipresent
himself
and
thereby
ceasing
to
be
god
it
is
thus
shown
to
be
a
demonstrable
truth
that
the
omnipresence
of
the
father
does
and
must
exclude
that
of
the
son
and
thus
exclude
the
possibility
of
his
apatheosis
or
incarnated
deityship
in
other
words
it
is
established
as
a
scientific
principle
upon
a
philosophical
and
mathematical
basis
that
jesus
christ
was
not
and
could
not
be
the
great
i
am
the
only
true
god
we
will
notice
one
other
philosophical
absurdity
involved
in
the
doctrine
of
the
divine
incarnation
one
other
solecism
comprehended
in
the
childish
notion
which
invests
the
infinite
god
with
finite
attributes
it
is
a
and
axiom
in
philosocomplete
god
and
thereby
that
the
son
could
not
be
omnipresent
and
that
the
less
can
not
be
made
to
contain
the
greater
a
pint
bottle
can
not
be
made
to
contain
a
quart
of
wine
for
the
same
reason
a
finite
body
can
not
contain
an
infinite
spirit
hence
philosophy
presses
the
conclusion
that
the
man
christ
jesus
could
not
have
comprehended
in
himself
the
godhead
bodily
inasmuch
as
it
would
have
required
the
infinite
god
to
be
incorporated
in
a
finite
human
body
we
are
therefore
compelled
to
reject
the
doctrine
of
the
incarnate
divinity
the
belief
in
the
deityship
of
jesus
christ
because
with
many
other
reasons
enumerated
elsewhere
it
involves
a
direct
tilt
against
some
of
the
plainest
principles
of
science
and
challenges
ay
virtually
overthrows
some
of
the
fundamental
laws
of
both
natural
and
moral
philosophy
no
philosopher
therefore
does
or
can
believe
in
the
absolute
divinity
of
jesus
christ

physiological
absurdities
of
the
doctrine
of
the
divine
incarnation
there
is
also
a
physiological
principle
discovered
by
the
author
comprised
in
the
doctrine
of
the
divine
incarnation
fatal
in
its
practical
and
logical
application
to
the
divinity
of
jesus
christ
and
all
the
other
incarnate
or
gods
of
antiquity
it
is
evidently
fraught
with
much
logical
force
it
is
based
upon
the
law
of
mental
and
physical
correspondence
as
is
the
physical
conformation
so
is
the
mentality
is
a
law
of
analogy
which
pilots
us
to
nearly
all
our
practical
knowledge
of
the
natural
world
a
knowledge
of
either
serves
as
an
index
to
the
other
when
we
observe
an
animal
possessing
that
physical
form
and
construction
peculiar
to
its
species
we
expect
to
find
it
practically
exhibiting
the
nature
character
disposition
and
habits
peculiar
to
that
class
of
animals
if
it
possesses
for
example
the
conformation
of
a
sheep
we
infer
at
once
that
it
has
the
disposition
of
a
sheep
and
we
are
never
disappointed
in
this
conclusion
and
when
we
encounter
an
animal
with
the
tiger
form
we
expect
to
see
exhibited
the
tiger
spirit
if
it
possesses
the
physical
conformation
of
the
tiger
we
are
never
deceived
or
misled
when
we
assign
it
a
predatory
disposition
if
it
is
a
tiger
form
it
is
sure
to
be
a
tiger
in
character
and
habits
and
so
of
all
the
genera
and
species
of
animals
that
range
upon
the
face
of
the
globe
we
may
travel
through
the
whole
field
of
animated
nature
and
observe
the
infallible
operation
of
this
beautiful
law
of
correspondence
till
we
come
however
to
the
crowning
work
of
god
called
man
here
we
find
this
law
this
beautiful
chain
of
analogy
broken
by
the
doctrine
of
the
divine
incarnation
god
becomes
a
man
at
least
is
made
to
exhibit
every
external
appearance
of
a
man
all
external
distinction
between
god
and
man
is
thus
obliterated
so
that
the
very
first
being
we
meet
in
the
street
or
on
the
highway
possessing
the
form
size
and
physical
conformation
of
a
man
and
presenting
every
other
external
appearance
of
being
a
man
may
nevertheless
be
a
god
and
no
less
is
this
objection
practically
exemplified
and
not
less
is
the
infraction
of
this
beautiful
law
of
analogy
observable
in
the
case
of
jesus
christ
than
in
the
numerous
other
incarnate
gods
and
demigods
of
antiquity
being
in
appearance
a
man
how
was
he
to
be
or
how
could
he
be
visually
distinguished
from
a
man
or
how
could
those
men
who
were
cotemporary
with
him
know
as
they
approached
him
or
as
they
approached
each
other
whether
they
were
meeting
a
man
or
a
god
seeing
that
he
was
found
in
fashion
as
a
man
phil
ii
either
he
might
be
mistaken
for
a
man
or
they
for
a
god
they
were
constantly
liable
to
be
confounded
if
then
the
infinite
deityship
was
lodged
in
the
person
of
jesus
christ
it
is
evident
that
that
important
fundamental
law
of
nature
as
is
the
form
so
is
the
character
was
utterly
annulled
prostrated
annihilated
and
banished
from
the
world
by
the
act
so
that
all
was
and
is
henceforth
and
forever
chaos
confusion
and
uncertainty
for
if
the
principle
can
be
violated
in
one
instance
it
may
be
in
another
and
in
thousands
of
cases
ad
infinitum
if
one
case
could
be
allowed
to
occur
the
principle
is
established
and
universal
chain
of
analogy
is
broken
and
destroyed
for
to
intercept
the
law
is
to
break
the
tenth
and
ten
thousandth
link
alike
hence
it
is
evident
that
if
a
being
resembling
a
man
may
be
a
god
an
animal
resembling
a
cow
may
be
a
horse
and
yonder
stick
a
poisonous
adder
and
fatal
may
be
the
consequences
in
thousands
of
instances
in
judging
or
inferring
the
nature
and
character
of
an
animal
by
its
form
and
size
a
supposed
innocent
animal
might
be
a
deadly
enemy
or
vice
versa
can
we
then
believe
or
dare
we
believe
a
doctrine
so
atheistical
in
its
tendencies
as
that
the
infinite
diety
was
incorporated
in
the
person
of
the
meek
and
lowly
jesus
when
it
would
thus
set
at
naught
violate
prostrate
and
utterly
cancel
from
the
world
one
of
god
own
fundamental
laws
and
one
of
the
essential
principles
of
natural
science
and
banish
forever
the
harmony
of
the
universe
and
thus
inaugurate
a
state
of
universal
disorder
incertitude
anarchy
and
misrule
into
the
otherwise
beautifully
domain
of
nature
certainly
most
certainly
not
if
the
incarnation
of
the
deity
should
or
could
take
place
there
should
be
something
strikingly
peculiar
ay
infinitely
peculiar
in
his
figure
size
and
general
appearance
in
order
to
make
him
susceptible
of
being
distinguished
from
the
human
otherwise
men
would
be
liable
to
be
constantly
mistaking
and
worshiping
each
other
for
the
great
almighty
and
ubiquitous
god
and
thus
constantly
blundering
into
idolatry
and
we
actually
find
several
cases
reported
in
the
scriptures
mark
the
fact
well
of
men
ay
the
saints
themselves
being
led
into
this
error
being
led
to
commit
the
sin
of
idolatry
in
consequence
of
their
previous
acceptance
of
the
belief
in
a
that
is
a
god
of
human
size
and
type
john
in
two
instances
was
in
the
act
of
worshipping
a
being
possessing
the
human
form
whom
he
mistook
for
the
omnipotent
and
omnipresent
god
see
rev
xix
and
xxii
having
perhaps
been
taught
that
the
fullness
of
the
godhead
dwelt
bodily
in
christ
jesus
he
probably
mistook
the
being
he
met
for
him
and
hence
offered
to
worship
him
if
then
christ
own
inspired
disciples
could
thus
be
betrayed
into
the
sin
of
idolatry
by
having
abolished
the
infinite
distinction
between
the
divine
and
the
human
we
surely
find
here
a
very
weighty
argument
against
such
a
leveling
and
equalizing
doctrine
and
certainly
nothing
could
be
better
calculated
to
promote
the
sin
of
idolatry
than
thus
to
obliterate
the
broad
the
infinitely
grand
line
of
demarkation
between
the
infinite
god
and
his
finite
creature
man
indeed
may
we
not
here
find
the
very
origin
and
the
cause
of
the
now
general
prevalence
of
idolatry
in
pagan
countries
is
it
not
directly
traceable
to
the
demolition
of
the
broad
high
and
insurmountable
wall
of
distinction
which
ought
forever
to
stand
between
a
god
of
infinite
attributes
and
a
being
caged
up
in
the
human
form
certainly
most
certainly
it
is
hence
here
i
would
ask
how
can
christians
after
subscribing
to
the
doctrine
that
the
fullness
of
the
godhead
dwelt
bodily
in
the
man
christ
jesus
as
paul
very
appropriately
calls
him
condemn
the
people
of
any
age
or
nation
for
worshipping
as
god
their
that
is
beings
with
the
human
form
certainly
the
man
who
could
believe
that
the
infinite
god
could
be
comprehended
or
incorporated
in
the
person
of
jesus
could
easily
be
brought
to
believe
that
the
grand
lama
of
thibet
is
a
proper
object
of
divine
worship
he
only
lacks
the
substitution
of
names
substitute
the
grand
lama
for
that
of
jesus
christ
and
the
thing
is
done
and
idolatry
thus
becomes
an
easily
established
institution
and
its
abolition
in
any
country
an
absolute
moral
impossibility

the
divinity
of
jesus
christ
a
most
fatal
distrust
is
thrown
upon
the
miraculous
portions
of
the
history
of
jesus
christ
as
found
in
his
gospel
narratives
by
the
discovery
of
the
fact
brought
to
light
through
recent
archaeological
researches
that
the
same
marvelous
feats
the
same
miraculous
incidents
which
were
recorded
in
his
life
were
long
previously
ingrafted
into
the
sacred
biographies
of
gods
and
demigods
no
less
adored
and
worshipped
as
beings
possessing
divine
attributes
we
shall
leave
the
reader
to
account
for
the
long
list
of
astonishing
coincidences
as
we
proceed
to
recapitulate
and
abridge
from
previous
chapters
the
almost
innumerable
parallel
incidents
running
through
the
legendary
history
of
the
many
demigods
and
saviors
of
antiquity
the
historical
vouchers
are
given
we
shall
first
direct
attention
to
the
long
string
of
corresponding
events
recorded
in
the
sacred
histories
of
ancient
hindoo
gods
as
compared
with
those
of
jesus
christ
at
a
much
later
period
as
far
back
as
sacred
records
were
extant
and
traditions
were
current
in
the
east
which
taught
that
the
heathen
savior
chrishna
was
immaculately
conceived
and
born
of
a
spotless
virgin
who
had
never
known
man
that
the
author
of
or
agent
in
the
conception
was
a
spirit
or
ghost
of
course
a
holy
ghost
that
he
was
threatened
in
early
infancy
with
death
by
the
ruling
tyrant
cansa
that
his
parents
had
consequently
to
flee
with
him
to
gokul
for
safety
that
all
the
young
male
children
under
two
years
of
age
were
slain
by
an
order
issued
by
cansa
similar
to
that
of
herod
in
judea
that
angels
and
shepherds
attended
his
birth
that
his
birth
and
advent
occurred
on
the
of
december
that
it
occurred
in
accordance
with
previous
prophecy
that
he
was
presented
at
birth
with
frankincense
myrrh
that
he
was
saluted
and
worshipped
as
the
savior
of
men
according
to
the
report
of
the
late
christian
missionary
huelith
that
he
led
a
life
of
humility
and
practical
moral
usefulness
that
he
wrought
various
astounding
miracles
such
as
healing
the
sick
restoring
sight
to
the
blind
casting
out
devils
raising
the
dead
to
life
that
he
was
finally
put
to
death
upon
the
cross
crucified
between
two
thieves
after
which
he
descended
to
hell
rose
from
the
dead
and
ascended
back
to
heaven
in
the
sight
of
all
men
as
his
biblical
history
declares
for
hundreds
of
other
similar
parallels
including
his
doctrines
and
precepts
see
chapter
xxxii
now
all
these
were
matters
of
the
firmest
belief
more
than
three
thousand
years
ago
in
the
minds
of
millions
of
the
most
devout
worshippers
that
ever
bowed
the
knee
in
humble
prayer
to
the
father
of
mercies
the
reader
can
draw
his
own
deduction
and
then
we
have
presented
similar
brief
lists
of
parallels
in
chapter
comprised
in
a
comparative
view
of
the
miraculous
lives
of
the
judean
and
egyptian
saviors
christ
alcides
osiris
tulis
in
this
analogous
exhibition
it
will
be
observed
the
egyptian
gods
are
reported
as
remotely
as
b
c
as
performing
besides
several
of
the
miraculous
achievements
enumerated
above
other
miracles
equally
indicative
of
divine
power
such
as
converting
water
into
wine
causing
rain
to
descend
from
heaven
and
on
the
occasion
of
the
crucifixion
of
tulis
we
are
told
the
sun
became
darkened
and
the
moon
refused
to
shine
we
find
also
several
instances
of
raising
the
dead
to
life
in
works
portraying
the
miraculous
achievements
of
the
egyptian
gods
the
relation
being
given
in
such
specific
detail
in
some
cases
that
the
names
of
the
reanimated
dead
are
furnished
tyndarus
and
hypolitus
were
instances
of
this
kind
both
according
to
julius
having
been
raised
from
the
dead
descending
the
line
of
history
until
we
arrive
at
the
confines
of
grecian
theology
we
find
here
the
same
train
of
marvelous
events
recorded
in
the
histories
of
their
gods
as
we
have
shown
in
chapter
such
as
their
healing
the
sick
and
the
cripples
causing
the
blind
to
see
the
lame
to
walk
the
dead
to
be
resuscitated
to
life
and
cases
as
we
have
shown
are
reported
of
their
reading
the
thoughts
of
their
disciples
as
jesus
did
those
of
the
woman
of
samaria
apollonius
declares
he
knew
many
hindoo
saints
to
perform
this
achievement
with
entire
strangers
likewise
apollonius
of
tyana
and
simon
magus
both
cotemporary
with
jesus
christ
we
have
arranged
in
the
historic
parallel
see
chapter
xxxiii
with
their
long
train
of
miracles
constituting
an
exact
counterpart
with
those
related
in
the
gospel
history
of
christ
and
including
in
apollonius
case
besides
those
specified
in
the
histories
of
the
gods
above
named
the
miracle
of
transfiguration
the
resurrection
from
the
dead
his
visible
ascent
to
heaven
while
simon
magus
was
very
expert
in
casting
out
devils
raising
the
dead
allaying
storms
walking
on
the
sea
but
without
recapitulating
further
we
will
recite
some
new
historic
facts
not
embraced
in
any
of
the
preceding
chapters
of
this
work
and
tending
to
demonstrate
still
further
the
universal
analogy
of
all
religions
past
and
present
in
their
claims
for
a
miraculous
power
for
their
gods
and
incarnate
saviors
the
new
york
correspondent
published
in
furnishes
us
the
following
brief
history
of
an
ancient
chinese
god
known
as
beddou
all
the
eastern
writers
agree
in
placing
the
birth
of
beddou
the
doctrines
of
this
deity
prevailed
over
japan
china
and
ceylon
according
to
the
sacred
tenets
of
his
religion
is
incessantly
rendering
himself
incarnate
but
his
greatest
and
most
solemn
incarnation
was
three
thousand
years
ago
in
the
province
of
cashmere
under
the
name
of
fot
or
beddou
he
was
believed
to
have
sprung
from
the
right
intercostal
of
a
virgin
of
the
royal
blood
who
when
she
became
a
mother
did
not
the
less
continue
to
be
a
virgin
that
the
king
of
the
country
uneasy
at
his
birth
was
desirous
to
put
him
to
death
and
hence
caused
all
the
males
that
were
born
at
the
same
period
to
be
put
to
death
and
also
that
being
saved
by
shepherds
he
lived
in
the
desert
to
the
age
of
thirty
years
at
which
time
he
opened
his
commission
preaching
the
doctrines
of
truth
and
casting
out
devils
that
he
performed
a
multitude
of
the
most
astonishing
miracles
spent
his
life
fasting
and
in
the
severest
mortifications
and
at
his
death
bequeathed
to
his
disciples
the
volume
in
which
the
principles
of
his
religion
are
contained
here
it
will
be
observed
are
some
very
striking
counterparts
to
the
miraculous
incidents
found
related
in
the
gospel
history
of
jesus
christ
and
no
less
analogous
is
the
no
less
story
of
quexalcote
of
mexico
which
the
rev
maurice
concedes
to
be
and
lord
kingsborough
and
niebuhr
in
his
history
of
rome
prove
to
be
much
older
than
the
gospel
account
of
jesus
christ
according
to
ind
humboldt
researches
in
mexico
lord
mexican
and
other
works
the
incarnate
god
quexalcote
was
born
about
of
a
spotless
virgin
by
the
name
chimalman
and
led
a
life
of
the
deepest
humility
and
piety
retired
to
a
wilderness
fasted
forty
days
was
worshipped
as
a
god
and
was
finally
crucified
between
two
thieves
after
which
he
was
buried
and
descended
into
hell
but
rose
again
the
third
day
the
following
is
a
part
of
lord
testimony
in
the
case
the
temptation
of
quexalcote
the
fast
of
forty
days
ordained
by
the
mexican
ritual
the
cup
with
which
he
was
presented
to
drink
on
the
cross
the
reed
which
was
his
sign
the
star
which
he
is
designated
the
or
divine
stone
which
was
laid
on
his
altar
and
which
was
likewise
an
object
of
adoration
all
these
circumstances
connected
with
many
others
relating
to
quexalcote
of
mexico
but
which
are
here
omitted
are
very
curious
and
mysterious
vol
vi
mexican
ant
again
quexalcote
is
represented
in
the
painting
of
codex
borgianus
as
nailed
to
the
cross
see
mex
ant
vol
vi
p
one
plate
in
this
work
represents
him
as
being
crucified
in
the
heavens
one
as
being
crucified
between
two
thieves
sometimes
he
is
represented
as
being
nailed
to
the
cross
and
sometimes
as
hanging
with
the
cross
in
his
hands
the
same
work
speaks
of
his
burial
descent
into
hell
and
his
resurrection
while
the
account
of
his
immaculate
conception
and
miraculous
birth
are
found
in
a
work
called
codex
vaticanus
other
parallel
incidents
could
be
cited
if
we
had
space
for
them
appertaining
to
the
history
of
this
mexican
god
and
parallels
might
also
be
constructed
upon
the
histories
of
other
ancient
gods
as
that
of
sakia
of
india
salivahana
of
bermuda
hesus
or
eros
of
the
celtic
druids
mithra
of
persia
hil
and
feta
of
the
mandaites
but
we
will
close
with
the
testimony
of
a
french
philosopher
bagin
on
the
subject
of
deific
incarnations
this
writer
says
the
most
ancient
histories
are
those
of
gods
who
became
incarnate
in
order
to
govern
mankind
all
those
fables
are
the
same
in
spirit
and
sprang
up
everywhere
from
confused
ideas
which
have
universally
prevailed
among
mankind
that
gods
formerly
descended
upon
earth
now
we
ask
the
christian
reader
and
it
will
be
the
first
query
of
every
man
whose
religious
faith
has
not
made
shipwreck
of
his
reason
what
does
all
this
mean
how
are
you
going
to
sustain
the
declaration
that
jesus
christ
was
the
only
son
and
sent
of
god
in
view
of
these
historic
facts
where
are
the
superior
credentials
of
his
claim
how
will
you
prove
his
apparently
legendary
history
that
is
the
miraculous
portion
of
his
history
to
be
real
and
the
others
false
we
boldly
aver
it
can
not
be
done
please
answer
these
questions
or
relinquish
your
doctrine
of
the
divinity
of
jesus
christ
chapter
xxxix
the
scriptural
view
of
christ
divinity
the
monstrous
scientific
paradox
as
coming
ages
will
regard
it
comprehended
in
the
conception
of
an
almighty
omnipresent
and
infinite
being
the
creator
of
innumerable
worlds
by
him
christ
were
all
things
made
that
were
made
john
i
being
born
of
a
frail
and
finite
woman
as
taught
by
both
the
oriental
and
christian
religion
is
so
exceedingly
shocking
to
every
rational
mind
which
has
not
been
sadly
warped
perverted
and
coerced
into
the
belief
by
early
psychological
influence
that
we
would
naturally
presume
that
those
who
on
the
assumption
of
the
remotest
possibility
of
its
truth
should
venture
to
put
forth
a
doctrine
so
glaringly
unreasonable
and
so
obviously
untenable
would
of
course
vindicate
it
and
establish
it
by
the
strongest
arguments
and
by
the
most
unassailable
and
most
irrefragable
proofs
and
that
in
setting
forth
a
doctrine
so
manifestly
at
war
with
every
law
and
analogy
of
nature
and
every
principle
of
science
no
language
should
have
been
used
nor
the
slightest
admission
made
that
could
possibly
lead
to
the
slightest
degree
of
suspicion
that
the
original
authors
and
propagators
of
this
doctrine
had
either
any
doubt
of
the
truth
of
the
doctrine
themselves
or
were
wanting
in
the
most
ample
the
most
abundant
proof
to
sustain
it
no
language
no
text
not
a
word
not
a
syllable
should
have
been
used
making
the
most
remote
concession
damaging
to
the
validity
of
the
doctrine
so
that
not
the
shadow
of
a
shade
of
doubt
could
be
left
on
any
mind
of
its
truth
omnipotent
indeed
should
be
the
logic
and
irresistible
the
proof
in
support
of
a
thesis
or
a
doctrine
which
so
squarely
confronts
and
contradicts
all
the
observation
all
the
experience
the
whole
range
of
scientific
knowledge
and
the
common
sense
of
mankind
how
startling
then
to
every
devout
and
honest
professor
of
the
christian
faith
ought
to
be
the
recent
discovery
of
the
fact
that
the
great
majority
of
the
texts
having
any
bearing
upon
the
doctrine
of
the
divinity
of
jesus
christ
a
large
majority
of
the
passages
in
the
very
book
on
which
the
doctrine
is
predicated
and
which
is
acknowledged
as
the
sole
warranty
for
such
a
belief
are
actually
at
variance
with
the
doctrine
and
actually
amount
to
its
virtual
denial
and
overthrow
for
we
find
upon
a
critical
examination
of
the
matter
that
at
least
of
the
texts
both
in
the
gospels
and
epistles
which
relate
to
the
divinity
of
christ
specifically
or
by
implication
either
teach
a
different
and
a
contrary
doctrine
or
make
concessions
entirely
fatal
to
it
by
investing
him
with
finite
human
qualities
utterly
incompatible
with
the
character
and
attributes
of
a
divine
or
infinite
being
how
strange
then
how
superlatively
strange
that
millions
should
yet
hold
to
such
a
strange
freak
of
nature
such
a
dark
relic
of
oriental
heathenism
such
a
monstrously
foolish
and
childish
superstition
as
that
which
teaches
the
infinite
creator
and
upholder
of
the
universe
could
be
reduced
so
near
to
nonentity
as
was
required
to
pass
through
the
ordinary
stages
of
human
generation
human
birth
and
human
parturition
a
puerile
notion
which
reason
science
nature
philosophy
and
common
sense
proclaim
to
be
supremely
absurd
and
impossible
and
which
even
the
scriptures
fail
to
sustain
a
logical
scriptural
exposition
of
which
we
will
here
present
a
brief
summary
the
essential
attributes
of
a
god
and
creator
and
upholder
of
all
things
are
infinitude
omnipotence
omniscience
and
omnipresence
and
any
being
not
possessing
all
these
attributes
to
repletion
or
possessing
any
quality
or
characteristic
in
the
slightest
degree
incompatible
with
any
one
of
these
attributes
can
not
be
a
god
in
a
divine
sense
but
must
of
necessity
be
a
frail
fallible
finite
being
jesus
christ
disclaims
hundreds
of
times
over
directly
or
impliedly
the
inherent
possession
of
any
one
of
these
divine
attributes
his
evangelical
biographers
have
invested
him
with
the
entire
category
of
human
qualities
and
characteristics
each
one
of
which
is
entirely
unbefitting
a
god
and
taken
together
are
the
only
distinguishing
characteristics
by
which
we
can
know
a
man
from
a
god
furthermore
there
issued
from
his
own
mouth
various
sayings
and
concessions
most
fatal
to
the
conception
of
his
being
a
god
his
devout
biographers
have
reported
various
actions
and
movements
in
his
practical
life
which
we
are
compelled
to
regard
as
absolutely
irreconcilable
with
the
infinite
majesty
lofty
character
and
supreme
attributes
of
an
almighty
being
these
human
qualities
were
so
obvious
to
all
who
saw
him
and
all
who
became
acquainted
with
him
that
doubts
sprang
up
among
his
own
immediate
followers
which
ultimately
matured
into
an
open
avowal
of
disbelief
in
his
divinity
in
that
early
age
upon
the
axiomatical
principles
of
philosophy
it
is
an
utter
and
absolute
impossibility
to
unite
in
repletion
the
divine
and
the
human
in
the
same
being
and
then
christ
had
a
human
birth
he
was
constituted
in
part
like
human
beings
of
flesh
and
blood
he
became
on
certain
occasions
an
hungered
like
finite
beings
he
also
became
thirsty
john
xix
like
perishable
mortals
he
often
slept
like
mortals
and
thus
became
to
dumb
forgetfulness
a
prey
he
sometimes
became
weary
like
human
beings
see
john
iv
he
was
occasionally
tempted
like
fallible
mortals
matt
iv
his
soul
became
exceeding
sorrowful
as
a
frail
finite
being
matt
xxvi
he
disclosed
the
weakness
of
human
passion
by
weeping
john
xi
he
was
originally
an
imperfect
being
made
perfect
through
suffering
heb
ii
he
increased
in
wisdom
and
stature
luke
ii
therefore
he
must
have
possessed
finite
changeable
mortal
attributes
and
he
finally
died
and
was
buried
like
all
perishable
mortals
he
could
not
possibly
from
these
considerations
have
been
a
god
it
is
utterly
impracticable
to
associate
with
or
comprehend
in
a
god
of
infinite
powers
and
infinite
attributes
all
or
any
of
these
finite
human
qualities
dark
intellectually
dark
indeed
must
be
that
mind
and
sunk
sorrowfully
sunk
in
superstition
that
can
worship
a
being
as
the
great
omniscient
omnipotent
and
omnipresent
i
am
who
possessed
all
those
qualities
which
were
constitutionally
characteristic
of
the
pious
the
noble
the
devout
the
godlike
yet
finite
and
fallible
jesus
according
to
his
own
admissions
and
the
representations
of
his
own
interested
biographers
the
only
step
which
the
disciples
of
the
christian
faith
have
made
toward
disproving
or
setting
aside
these
arguments
objections
and
difficulties
is
that
of
assigning
the
incarnate
jesus
a
double
or
twofold
nature
the
amalgamation
of
the
human
and
divine
a
postulate
and
a
groundless
assumption
which
we
have
proved
and
demonstrated
by
thirteen
arguments
which
we
believe
to
be
unanswerable
is
not
only
absurd
illogical
and
impossible
but
foolish
and
ludicrous
in
the
highest
degree
see
vol
ii
this
senseless
hypothesis
and
every
other
assumption
and
argument
made
use
of
by
the
professors
of
the
christian
faith
to
vindicate
their
favorite
dogma
of
the
divinity
of
jesus
we
have
shown
to
be
equally
applicable
to
the
demigods
of
the
ancient
heathen
more
than
twenty
of
whom
were
invested
with
the
same
combination
of
human
and
divine
qualities
which
the
followers
and
worshippers
of
jesus
claim
for
him
testimony
of
the
father
against
the
divinity
of
the
son
the
father
utterly
precludes
the
son
from
any
participation
in
the
divine
essence
or
any
claim
in
the
godhead
by
such
declarations
as
the
following
i
am
jehovah
and
beside
me
there
is
no
savior
isaiah
xliii
how
then
we
would
ask
can
jesus
christ
be
the
savior
i
jehovah
am
thy
savior
and
thy
redeemer
then
christ
can
be
neither
the
savior
nor
redeemer
there
is
no
god
else
beside
me
a
just
god
and
a
savior
there
is
none
beside
me
isaiah
xiv
so
the
father
virtually
declares
according
to
the
inspired
prophet
isaiah
that
the
son
in
a
divine
sense
can
not
be
either
god
savior
or
redeemer
again
i
am
jehovah
thy
god
and
thou
shalt
not
acknowledge
a
god
beside
me
hosea
xiii
here
christ
is
not
only
by
implication
cut
off
from
the
godhead
but
positively
prohibited
from
being
worshipped
as
god
and
thus
the
testimony
of
the
father
disproves
and
sets
aside
the
divinity
of
the
son
testimony
of
the
mother
when
mary
found
after
a
long
search
her
son
jesus
in
the
temple
disputing
with
the
doctors
and
chided
or
reproved
him
for
staying
from
home
without
the
consent
of
his
parents
and
declared
thy
father
and
i
sought
thee
sorrowing
luke
ii
she
proclaimed
a
twofold
denial
of
his
divinity
in
the
first
place
it
can
not
be
possible
that
she
regarded
her
son
jesus
as
that
awful
being
before
whom
the
devout
saints
bow
in
trembling
fear
when
she
used
such
language
and
evinced
such
a
spirit
as
she
did
why
hast
thou
thus
dealt
with
us
luke
ii
is
her
chiding
language
and
then
when
she
speaks
of
joseph
as
his
father
thy
father
and
i
she
issues
a
declaration
against
his
divinity
which
ought
to
be
regarded
as
settling
the
question
forever
for
who
could
know
better
than
the
mother
or
rather
who
could
know
but
the
mother
who
the
father
of
the
child
jesus
was
and
as
she
acknowledges
it
was
joseph
she
thus
repudiates
the
story
of
the
immaculate
conception
which
constitutes
the
whole
basis
for
the
claim
of
his
divinity
hence
the
testimony
of
the
mother
also
disproves
his
title
to
the
godhead
testimony
or
disclaimer
of
the
son
we
will
show
by
a
specific
citation
of
texts
that
there
is
not
one
attribute
comprehended
in
or
peculiar
to
a
divine
and
infinite
being
but
that
christ
rejects
as
applicable
to
himself
that
he
most
conclusively
disclaims
every
attribute
of
a
divine
being
both
by
precept
and
practice
and
often
in
the
most
explicit
language
by
declaring
the
son
can
do
nothing
of
himself
john
he
most
emphatically
disclaims
the
attribute
of
omnipotence
for
an
omnipotent
being
can
need
no
aid
and
can
accept
of
none
when
he
acknowledged
and
avowed
his
ignorance
of
the
day
of
judgment
which
must
be
presumed
to
be
the
most
important
event
in
the
world
history
he
disclaimed
the
attribute
of
omniscience
of
that
day
and
hour
knoweth
no
man
neither
the
son
but
the
father
only
matt
xxiv
now
as
an
omniscient
being
must
possess
all
knowledge
his
avowed
ignorance
in
this
case
is
a
confession
he
was
not
omniscient
and
hence
not
a
god
and
when
he
declares
i
am
glad
for
your
sakes
i
was
not
there
at
the
grave
of
lazarus
he
most
distinctly
disavows
being
omnipresent
and
thus
denies
to
himself
another
essential
attribute
of
an
infinite
god
and
the
emphatic
declaration
i
live
by
the
father
john
vi
is
a
direct
disclaimer
of
the
attributes
of
as
a
being
who
lives
by
another
can
not
be
and
per
consequence
not
the
infinite
god
he
disclaims
possessing
infinite
goodness
another
essential
attribute
of
a
supreme
divine
being
why
callest
thou
me
good
there
is
none
good
but
one
that
is
god
mark
x
he
disclaim
divine
honors
and
directed
them
to
the
father
i
honor
my
father
john
viii
i
receive
not
honor
from
men
john
v
he
recommended
supreme
worship
to
the
father
and
not
to
himself
the
true
worshippers
shall
worship
the
father
in
spirit
and
in
truth
john
iv
he
ascribed
supreme
dominion
to
the
father
thine
is
the
kingdom
and
the
power
and
the
glory
forever
matt
vi
it
will
be
seen
from
the
foregoing
text
that
christ
also
acknowledges
that
the
kingdom
is
the
father
a
god
without
a
kingdom
would
be
a
ludicrous
state
of
things
he
conceded
supreme
authority
to
the
father
my
doctrine
is
not
mine
but
his
that
sent
me
john
vii
he
considered
the
father
as
the
supreme
protector
and
preserver
of
even
his
own
disciples
i
pray
that
thou
shouldst
keep
them
from
the
evil
john
xvii
what
omnipotence
not
able
to
protect
his
own
disciples
in
fine
he
humbly
acknowledged
that
his
power
his
will
his
ministry
his
mission
his
authority
his
works
his
knowledge
and
his
very
life
were
all
from
and
belonged
to
and
were
under
the
control
of
the
father
i
can
do
nothing
of
myself
i
came
to
do
the
will
of
him
that
sent
me
the
father
that
dwelleth
within
me
he
doeth
the
work
a
god
within
a
god
is
an
old
pagan
otaheitan
doctrine
he
declared
that
even
spiritual
communion
was
the
work
of
the
father
see
john
vi
he
acknowledged
himself
controlled
by
the
father
see
john
v
he
acknowledged
his
entire
helplessness
and
dependence
on
the
father
the
son
can
do
nothing
of
himself
but
what
he
seeth
the
father
do
john
v
he
acknowledged
that
even
his
body
was
the
work
of
his
father
in
other
words
that
he
was
dependent
on
his
father
for
his
physical
life
see
heb
xvi
and
more
than
all
he
not
only
called
the
father
the
only
true
god
john
xvii
but
calls
him
my
father
and
my
god
john
xx
now
it
would
be
superlative
nonsense
to
consider
a
being
himself
a
god
or
the
god
who
could
use
such
language
as
is
here
ascribed
to
the
humble
jesus
this
text
this
language
is
sufficient
of
itself
to
show
that
christ
could
not
have
laid
any
claim
to
the
godhead
on
any
occasion
unless
we
degrade
him
to
the
charge
of
the
most
palpable
and
shameful
contradiction
he
uniformly
directed
his
disciples
to
pray
not
to
him
but
the
father
see
matt
vi
on
one
occasion
as
we
have
cited
the
proof
in
matt
xi
he
even
acknowledged
john
the
baptist
to
be
greater
than
he
while
it
must
be
patent
to
every
reader
that
no
man
could
be
greater
than
the
almighty
supreme
potentate
of
heaven
and
earth
in
any
sense
whatever
testimony
of
the
disciples
another
remarkable
proof
of
the
human
sireship
of
jesus
is
that
one
of
his
own
disciples
ay
one
of
the
chosen
twelve
selected
by
him
as
being
endowed
with
a
perfect
knowledge
of
his
character
mission
and
origin
this
witness
thus
posted
and
thus
authorized
proclaims
in
unequivocal
language
that
jesus
was
the
son
of
joseph
hear
the
language
of
philip
addressed
to
nathanael
we
have
found
him
of
whom
moses
in
the
law
and
the
prophets
did
write
jesus
of
nazareth
the
son
of
joseph
john
i
no
language
could
be
more
explicit
no
declaration
more
positive
that
jesus
was
the
son
of
joseph
and
no
higher
authority
could
be
adduced
to
settle
the
question
coming
as
it
does
from
headquarters
and
what
will
or
what
can
the
devout
stickler
for
the
divinely
paternal
origin
of
jesus
christ
do
with
such
testimony
it
is
a
clincher
which
no
sophistry
can
set
aside
no
reasoning
can
grapple
with
and
no
logic
overthrow
his
disciples
instead
of
representing
him
as
being
the
only
true
god
often
speak
of
him
in
contradistinction
to
god
they
never
speak
of
him
as
the
god
christ
jesus
but
as
the
man
christ
jesus
tim

jesus
of

a
man

it
would
certainly
be
blasphemy
to
speak
of
the
supreme
being
as
a
man
approved
of

christian
reader
reflect
upon
this
text
by
that
man
whom
he
die

by
the
assumption
of
the
godhead
of
christ
we
would
be
presented
with
the
double
or
twofold
solecism
of
god
being
ordained
by
another
god
and
that
of
his
being
blasphemously
called
a
man
paul
declaration
has
been
cited
that
unto
us
there
is
but
one
god
the
father
cor
iv
now
it
is
plain
to
common
sense
that
if
there
is
but
one
god
and
that
god
is
comprehended
in
the
father
then
christ
is
entirely
excluded
from
the
godhead
if
john
declaration
be
true
that
no
man
hath
seen
god
at
any
time
john
iv
then
the
important
question
arises
how
could
christ
be
god
as
he
was
seen
by
thousands
of
men
and
seen
hundreds
of
times
god
the
father
is
declared
to
be
the
one
the
holy
one
the
only
one
more
than
one
hundred
times
as
if
purposely
to
exclude
the
participation
of
any
other
being
in
the
godhead
this
one
this
only
god
is
shown
to
be
the
father
alone
in
more
than
four
thousand
texts
thirteen
hundred
and
of
which
are
found
in
the
new
testament
more
than
fifty
texts
have
been
found
which
declare
either
explicitly
or
by
implication
that
god
the
father
has
no
equal
which
effectually
denies
or
shuts
out
the
divine
equality
of
the
son
to
whom
will
ye
liken
me
or
shall
i
be
equal

the
holy

christ
in
the
new

called

times
egregious
and
dishonorable
misnomers

certainly
to
apply
to
a
supreme
and
infinite
deity
on
the
other
hand
he
is
called
god
but
three
times
and
denominates
himself
the
son
of
god
but
once
and
that
rather
obscurely
the
father
is
spoken
of
in
several
instances
as
standing
in
the
relation
of
god
to
the
son
as
the
god
of
our
lord
jesus

ye

now
the
god
of
a

is
a
polytheistic
heathen
conception
and
no
meaning
or
interpretation
as
we
have
shown
can
be
i
forced
upon
such
texts
as
these
that
will
not
admit
a
plurality
of
gods
if
we
admit
the
titles
as
applicable
to
christ
or
that
his
scriptural
biographers
intend
to
apply
such
a
title
in
a
superior
or
supreme
sense
many
texts
make
christ
the
mere

to
consider
a
being
thus
spoken
of
as
himself
the
supreme
god
is
as
we
have
demonstrated
the
very
climax
of
absurdity
and
nonsense
to
believe
the
servant
of
god
is
god
himself
that
is
the
servant
of
himself
and
that
god
and
his
image
are
the
same
is
to
descend
within
one
step
of
buffoonery
and
then
it
has
been
ascertained
that
there
are
more
than
three
hundred
texts
which
declare
either
expressly
or
by
implication
christ
subordination
to
and
dependence
on
the
father
as
i
can
do

there
are
many
divine
titles
applied
to
the
father
which
are
never
used
in
reference
to
the
son
as
jehovah
the
most
high
god
almighty
the
almighty
on
the
other
hand
those
few
divine
epithets
or
titles
which
are
used
in
application
to
jesus
christ
as
lord
god
savior
redeemer
intercessor
it
has
been
shown
were
all
used
prior
to
the
birth
of
christ
in
application
to
beings
known
and
acknowledged
to
be
men
and
some
of
them
are
found
so
applied
in
the
bible
itself
as
for
example
moses
is
called
a
god
in
two
instances
as
we
have
shown
and
cited
the
proof
in
ex
iv
vii
while
the
title
of
lord
is
applied
to
men
at
this
day
even
in
christian
countries
and
instances
have
been
cited
in
the
bible
of
the
term
savior
being
applied
to
men
both
in
the
singular
and
plural
numbers
see
kings
xiii
and
neh
ix
seeing
then
that
the
most
important
divine
titles
which
the
writers
of
the
new
testament
have
applied
to
jesus
were
previously
used
in
application
to
men
known
and
admitted
to
be
such
it
is
therefore
at
once
evident
that
those
titles
do
nothing
toward
proving
him
to
be
the
great
divine
being
as
the
modern
christian
world
assume
him
to
be
even
if
we
base
the
argument
wholly
on
scriptural
grounds
while
on
the
other
hand
we
have
demonstrated
it
to
be
an
absolute
impossibility
to
apply
with
any
propriety
or
any
sense
to
a
divine
infinite
omnipotent
being
those
finite
human
qualities
which
are
so
frequently
used
with
reference
to
jesus
throughout
the
new
testament
and
hence
even
if
we
should
suppose
or
concede
that
the
writers
of
the
new
testament
did
really
believe
him
to
be
the
great
infinite
spirit
or
the
almighty
omnipotent
god
must
conclude
they
were
mistaken
from
their
own
language
from
their
own
description
of
him
as
well
as
his
own
virtual
denial
and
rejection
of
such
a
claim
when
he
applied
to
himself
as
he
did
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
strictly
finite
human
qualities
and
human
titles
as
we
have
shown
wholly
incompatible
with
the
character
of
an
infinite
divine
being
we
say
from
the
foregoing
considerations
if
the
primitive
disciples
of
jesus
did
really
believe
him
to
be
the
great
infinite
both
their
descriptions
of
him
and
his
description
or
representation
of
himself
would
amply
and
most
conclusively
prove
that
they
were
mistaken
at
least
we
are
compelled
to
admit
that
there
is
either
an
error
in
applying
divine
titles
to
jesus
or
often
an
error
in
describing
his
qualities
and
powers
by
himself
and
his
original
followers
as
there
is
no
compatibility
or
agreement
between
the
two
divine
titles
to
such
a
being
as
they
represent
him
to
be
would
be
an
egregious
misnomer
we
say
then
that
it
must
be
clearly
and
conclusively
evident
to
every
unbiased
mind
from
evidence
furnished
by
the
bible
itself
that
if
the
divine
titles
applied
to
jesus
were
intended
to
have
a
divine
significance
then
they
are
misapplied
yet
we
would
not
here
conclude
an
intentional
misrepresentation
in
the
case
but
simply
a
mistake
growing
out
of
a
misconception
and
the
very
limited
childish
conception
of
the
nature
character
and
attributes
of
the
great
positive
mind
so
universally
prevalent
in
that
age
and
the
apparently
total
ignorance
of
the
distinguishing
characteristics
which
separate
the
divine
and
the
human
we
will
illustrate
some
children
on
passing
through
a
wild
portion
of
the
state
of
maine
recently
reported
they
encountered
a
bear
and
to
prove
they
could
not
be
mistaken
in
the
animal
they
described
it
as
being
a
tall
animal
with
long
slender
legs
of
yellowish
auburn
hue
a
short
white
bushy
tail
cloven
feet
large
branchy
horns
now
it
will
be
seen
at
once
that
while
their
description
of
the
animal
is
evidently
in
the
main
correct
they
had
simply
mistaken
a
deer
for
a
bear
and
hence
misnamed
the
animal
in
like
manner
we
must
conclude
from
the
repeated
instances
in
which
christ
biographers
have
ascribed
to
him
all
the
foibles
frailties
and
finite
qualities
and
characteristics
of
a
human
being
that
if
they
have
in
any
instance
called
him
a
god
in
a
divine
sense
it
is
an
egregious
misnomer
their
description
of
him
makes
him
a
man
and
but
a
man
whatever
may
have
been
their
opinion
with
respect
to
the
propriety
of
calling
him
a
god
and
if
the
two
do
not
harmonize
the
former
must
rule
the
judgment
in
all
cases
the
truth
is
the
jewish
founders
of
christianity
entertained
such
a
low
narrow
contracted
and
mean
opinion
of
deity
and
the
infinite
distinction
and
distance
between
the
divine
and
the
human
that
their
theology
reduced
him
to
a
level
with
man
and
hence
they
usually
described
him
as
a
man

a
metonymic
view
of
the
divinity
of
jesus
christ
if
jesus
christ
were
truly
god
or
if
there
existed
such
a
and
oneness
between
the
father
and
the
son
that
they
constituted
but
one
being
or
divine
essence
then
what
is
true
of
one
is
true
of
the
other
and
a
change
of
names
and
titles
from
one
to
the
other
can
not
alter
the
sense
of
the
text
let
us
then
substitute
the
titles
found
applied
to
the

in
the

now
the
question
arises
is
the
above
representation
a
true
one
most
certainly
it
must
be
if
jesus
and
the
father
are
but
one
almighty
being
a
change
of
names
and
titles
can
not
alter
the
truth
nor
the
sense
to
say
that
chief
justice

gone
south
secretary
chase
has
gone
south
governor
chase
has
gone
south
chase
has
gone
south
or
salmon
chase
has
gone

are
affirmations
equally
true
and
equally
sensible
because
they
all
have
reference
to
the
same
being
the
case
is
to
plain
to
need
argument
the
above
reversal
of
names
and
titles
of
jesus
and
the
father
may
sound
very
unpleasant
and
rather
grating
to
christians
simply
because
it
is
the
transposition
of
the
tides
of
two
very
scripturally
dissimilar
beings
instead
of
being
as
generally
taught
by
orthodox
christians
one
in
essence
one
in
mind
one
in
body
or
being
and
one
in
name
as
the
rev
barnes
affirms
most
false
is
his
statement
based
solely
on
scriptural
ground
if
jesus
is
very
god
and
there
is
but
one
god
then
the
foregoing
transposition
can
not
mar
the
sense
nor
altar
the
truth
of
one
text
quoted
chapter
xli
the
precepts
and
practical
life
of
jesus
christ
his
two
hundred
errors
the
exaltation
of
men
to
the
character
and
homage
of
divine
beings
has
always
had
the
effect
to
draw
a
vail
over
their
errors
and
imperfections
so
as
to
render
them
imperceptible
to
those
who
worship
them
as
gods
this
is
true
of
nearly
all
the
deified
men
of
antiquity
who
were
adored
as
incarnate
divinities
among
which
may
be
included
the
christian
jesus
christ
the
practice
of
the
followers
of
these
gods
has
been
when
an
error
was
pointed
out
in
their
teachings
brought
to
light
by
the
progress
of
science
and
general
intelligence
to
bestow
upon
the
text
some
new
and
unwarranted
meaning
entirely
incompatible
with
its
literal
reading
or
else
to
insist
with
a
godly
zeal
on
the
correctness
of
the
sentiment
inculcated
by
the
text
and
thus
essay
to
make
error
pass
for
truth
in
this
way
millions
of
the
disciples
of
these
gods
have
been
misled
and
blinded
and
made
to
believe
by
their
religious
teachers
and
their
religious
education
that
everything
taught
by
their
divine
exemplars
is
perfect
truth
in
perfect
harmony
with
science
sense
and
true
morals
indeed
the
perversion
of
the
mind
and
judgment
by
a
religious
education
has
been
in
many
cases
carried
to
such
an
extreme
as
to
cause
their
devout
and
prejudiced
followers
either
to
entirely
overlook
and
ignore
their
erroneous
teachings
or
to
magnify
them
into
truths
and
thus
as
before
stated
clothe
error
with
the
livery
of
truth
this
state
of
things
it
has
long
been
noticed
by
unprejudiced
minds
exists
amongst
the
millions
of
professed
believers
in
the
divinity
of
jesus
christ
hence
the
errors
both
in
his
moral
lessons
and
his
practical
life
have
passed
from
age
to
age
unnoticed
because
his
pious
and
followers
having
been
taught
that
he
was
a
divine
teacher
have
assumed
that
his
teachings
must
all
be
true
and
hence
too
have
instituted
no
scrutiny
to
determine
their
truth
or
falsity
but
we
will
now
proceed
to
show
that
the
progress
of
science
and
general
intelligence
has
brought
to
light
many
errors
not
only
in
his
teachings
but
in
his
practical
life
also
in
enumerating
them
we
will
arrange
them
under
the
head
moral
and
religious
errors
the
first
moral
precept
in
the
teachings
of
christ
which
we
will
bring
to
notice
is
one
of
a
numerous
class
which
may
very
properly
be
arranged
under
the
head
of
moral
extremism
we
find
many
of
his
admonitions
of
this
character
nearly
everything
that
is
said
is
oversaid
carried
to
extremes
thus
constituting
an
overwrought
extravagant
system
of
morality
impracticable
in
its
requisitions
as
for
example
take
no
thought
for
the
morrow
matt
if
the
spirit
of
this
injunction
were
carried
out
in
practical
life
there
would
be
no
grain
sown
and
no
seed
planted
in
spring
no
reaping
done
in
harvest
and
no
crop
garnered
in
autumn
and
the
result
would
be
universal
starvation
in
less
than
twelve
months
but
fortunately
for
society
the
christian
world
have
laid
this
positive
injunction
upon
the
table
under
the
rule
of
indefinite
postponement
christ
most
important
requisition
is
found
in
the
injunction
seek
ye
first
the
kingdom
of
god
and
his
righteousness
and
all
else
shall
be
added
unto
you
matt
vi
his
early
followers
understood
by
this
injunction
and
doubtless
understood
it
correctly
that
they
were
to
spend
their
lives
in
religious
devotion
and
neglect
the
practical
duties
of
life
leaving
providence
to
take
care
of
their
families
a
course
of
life
which
reduced
many
of
them
to
the
point
of
starvation
the
disciple
of
christ
is
required
when
smitten
on
one
cheek
to
turn
the
other
also
that
is
when
one
cheek
is
pommeled
into
a
jelly
by
some
vile
miscreant
or
drunken
wretch
turn
the
other
to
be
smashed
up
in
like
manner
this
is
an
extravagant
requisition
which
none
of
his
modern
disciples
even
attempt
to
observe
resist
not
evil
matt
breathes
forth
a
kindred
spirit
this
injunction
requires
you
to
stand
with
your
hands
in
your
pocket
while
being
maltreated
so
cruelly
and
unmercifully
that
the
forfeiture
of
your
life
may
be
the
consequence
at
least
christ
early
followers
so
understood
it
the
disciple
of
christ
is
required
when
his
cloak
is
formally
wrested
from
him
to
give
up
his
coat
also
see
matt
and
to
carry
out
the
principle
if
the
marauder
demands
it
he
must
next
give
up
his
boots
then
his
shirt
and
thus
strip
himself
of
all
his
garments
and
go
naked
this
looks
like
an
invitation
and
bribe
to
robbery
lay
not
up
for
yourselves
treasures
on
earth
matt
vi
this
is
another
positive
command
of
christ
which
the
modern
christian
world
by
common
consent
have
laid
on
the
table
under
the
rule
of
indefinite
postponement
under
the
conviction
that
the
wants
of
their
families
and
the
exigencies
of
sickness
and
old
age
can
not
be
served
if
they
should
live
up
to
such
an
injunction
sell
all
that
thou
hast
and
come
and
follow
me
is
another
command
which
bespeaks
more
piety
than
wisdom
as
all
who
have
attempted
to
comply
with
it
have
reduced
their
families
to
beggary
and
want
if
any
man
love
the
world
the
love
of
the
father
is
not
in
him
then
he
must
hate
it
as
there
are
but
the
two
principles
and
from
hate
proceed
envy
strife
evil
surmisings
and
persecution
evidently
the
remedy
in
this
case
for
is
worse
than
the
disease
he
that
cometh
to
me
and
hateth
not
father
mother
brother
and
sister
can
not
be
my
disciple
luke
xiv
this
breathes
forth
the
same
spirit
as
the
last
text
quoted
above
many
learned
expositions
have
been
penned
by
christian
writers
to
make
it
appear
that
hate
in
this
case
does
not
mean
hate
but
certainly
it
would
be
a
slander
upon
infinite
wisdom
to
leave
it
to
be
inferred
that
he
could
not
say
or
inspire
his
disciples
to
say
exactly
what
he
meant
and
to
say
it
so
plainly
as
to
leave
no
possibility
of
being
misunderstood
or
leave
any
ground
for
dispute
about
the
meaning
rejoice
and
be
exceeding
glad
when
persecuted
matt
v
now
as
a
state
of
rejoicing
is
the
highest
condition
of
happiness
that
can
be
realized
such
advice
must
naturally
prompt
the
religious
zealot
to
court
persecution
in
order
to
obtain
complete
happiness
and
consequently
to
pursue
a
life
to
provoke
persecution
whosoever
shall
seek
to
save
his
life
shall
lose
it
luke
xvii
here
is
displayed
the
spirit
of
martyrdom
which
has
made
millions
reckless
of
life
and
goaded
on
the
frenzied
bigot
to
seek
the
fiery
fagot
and
the
halter
we
regard
it
as
another
display
of
religious
fanaticism
ye
shall
be
hated
of
all
men
for
my
name
sake
matt
x
how
repulsive
must
have
been
their
doctrines
or
their
conduct
no
sensible
religion
could
excite
the
universal
hatred
of
mankind
for
it
would
contain
something
adapted
to
the
moral
religious
or
spiritual
taste
of
some
class
or
portion
of
society
and
hence
make
it
and
its
disciples
loved
instead
of
hated
and
then
how
could
they
be
hated
of
all
men
when
not
one
man
in
a
thousand
ever
heard
of
them
here
is
more
of
the
extravagance
of
religious
enthusiasm
shake
off
the
dust
of
your
feet
against
those
who
can
not
see
the
truth
or
utility
of
your
doctrines
matt
x
here
christ
encourages
in
his
disciples
a
spirit
of
contempt
for
the
opinions
of
others
calculated
to
make
them
hated
a
proper
regard
for
the
rules
of

the
latter
class
of
which
seem
to
have
been
much
the
most
numerous
a
preacher
who
should
attempt
to
carry
out
this
advice
at
the
present
day

be
stopped
at

issue
an
injunction

could

possibly
be
carried
out
it
never
has
been
and
never
will
be
executed
for
of
the
human
race
have
never
yet
heard
of

it
was
not
therefore
a
mark
of
wisdom
or
a
superior
mind
to
issue
such
an
injunction
and
he
that
believeth
and
is
baptized
shall
be

he
that
believeth
not
shall
be
damned
what
intolerance
bigotry
relentless
cruelty
and
ignorance
of
the
science
of
mind
are
here
displayed
no
philosopher
would
give
utterance
to
or
indorse
such
a
sentiment
it
assumes
that
belief
is
a
creature
of
the
will
and
that
a
man
can
believe
anything
he
chooses
which
is
wide
of
the
truth
and
the
assumption
has
been
followed
by
persecution
misery
and
bloodshed
all
things
whatsoever
ye
shall
ask
in
prayer
believing
ye
shall
receive
matt
xxi
here
is
an
entire
negation
of
natural
law
in
the
necessity
of
physical
labor
as
a
means
to
procure
the
comforts
of
life
when
anything
is
wanted
in
the
shape
of
food

raiment
it
is
to
be
obtained
according
to
this
text
by
going
down
on
your
knees
and
asking
god
to
bestow
it
but
no
christian
ever
realized
all
things
whatsoever
asked
for
in
prayer
thought

with
all
his
heart
he
should
obtain
it
the
author
knows
by
his
own
practical
experience
that
this
declaration
is
not
true
this
promise
has
been
falsified

of
times
by
thousands
of
praying
christians

matt
xxiii
the
christian
world
assume
that
much
of
what
christ
taught
is
mere
idle
nonsense
or
the
incoherent
utterings
of
a
religious
fanatic
for
they
pay
no
more
practical
attention
to
it
than
the
barking
of
a
dog
and
here
is
one
command
treated
in
this
manner
call
no
man

is
the
christian
who
refuses
to
call
his
earthly
sire
a
father
call
no
man

and
yet
mister
which
is
the
same
thing
is
the
most
common
title
in
christendom
he
who
enunciates
the
two
words
fool

be

danger

mercy
who
then
can
be

there
is
probably
not
a

who
has
not
called
somebody
a
fool
when
he
knew
him
to
be
such
and
could
not
with
truthfulness
be
called
anything
else
here
then
is
another
command
universally
ignored
and
indefinitely
postponed
swear
not
at
all
neither
by
heaven
nor
earth
matt
and
yet
no
christian
refuses
to
indulge
in
legal
if
not
profane
swearing
which
the
text
evidently
forbids

always

then
what
kind

matt
v
here
is
more
of
the
religious
extravagance
of
a
mind
uncultured
by
science
for
it
is
that
human
beings
can
make
no
approximation
to
divine
perfection
the
distance
between
human
imperfection
and
a
perfect
god
is
and

be
infinite

matt

a
custom
requiring
a
murderous
process
destructive
of
the
energies
of
life
and
the
vigor
of
manhood
and
rendering
the
subject
weak
effeminate
and
mopish
and
unfit
for
the
business
of
life
it
is
a
low
species
of
piety
and
discloses
a
lamentable
lack
of
a
scientific
knowledge
of
the
true
functions
of
the
sexual
organs
on
the
part
of
jesus
christ
also
encouraged
his
disciples
to
pluck
out
the
eye
and
cut
off
the
hand
as
a
means
of
rendering
it
impossible
to
perpetrate
evil
with
those
members
and
we
would
suggest
if
such
advice
is
consistent
with
sound
reasoning
the
head
also
should
be
cut
off
as
a
means
of
more
effectually
carrying
out
the
same
principle
such
advice
never
came
from
the
mouth
of
a
philosopher
it
is
a
part
of
system
of
extravagant
piety
he
also
taught
the
senseless
oriental
tradition
of
the
unpardonable
sin
against
the
holy
ghost
a
fabulous
being
who
figured
more
anciently
in
the
history
of
various
countries
see
chapter
xxii
no
philosopher
or
man
of
science
could
harbor
such
childish
misconceptions
as
are
embodied
in
this
tradition
which
neither
describes
the
being
nor
explains
the
nature
of
the
sin
we
find
many
proofs
in
christ
gospel
history
that
he
believed
in
the
ancient
heathen
tradition
which
taught
that
disease
is
caused
by
demons
and
evil
spirits
see
luke
vii
and
viii
many
cases
are
reported
of
his
relieving
the
obsessed
by
casting
out
the
diabolical
intruders
in
imitation
of
the
oriental
custom
long
in
vogue
in
various
countries
by
which
he
evinced
a
profound
ignorance
of
the
natural
causes
of
disease
christ
also
taught
the
old
pagan
superstition
that
god
is
a
god
of
anger
while
modern
science
teaches
that
it
would
be
as
impossible
for
a
god
of
perfect
and
infinite
attributes
to
experience
the
feeling
of
anger
as
to
commit
suicide
and
recent
discoveries
in
physiology
prove
that
anger
is
a
species
of
suicide
and
that
it
is
also
a
species
of
insanity
hence
an
angry
god
would
be
an
insane
god
an
omnipotent
lunatic
ruling
the
kingdom
of
heaven
which
would
make
heaven
a
lunatic
asylum
and
rather
a
dangerous
place
to
live
and
christ
injunction
to
fear
god
also
implies
that
he
is
an
angry
being
see
luke
xxiii
but
y
past
history
proves
that
the
fear
of
god
has
always
been
the
great
lever
of
priestcraft
and
the
most
paltry
and
pitiful
motive
that
ever
moved
the
human
mind
it
has
paralyzed
the
noblest
intellects
crushed
the
elasticity
of
youth
and
augmented
the
hesitating
indecision
of
old
age
and
finally
filled
the
world
with
cowardly
trembling
slaves
no
philosopher
will
either
love
or
worship
a
god
he
fears
the
fear
of
the
lord
is
a
very
ancient
heathen
superstition
the
inducement
christ
holds
out
for
leading
a
virtuous
life
by
the
promise
of
well
done
thou
good
and
faithful
servant
bespeaks
a
childish
ignorance
of
the
nature
of
the
human
mind
and
the
true
science
of
life
it
ranks
with
the
promise
of
the
nurse
of
to
the
boy
if
he
would
keep
his
garments
unsoiled
for
the
remainder
of
the
two
hundred
errors
of
christ
see
vol
ii
there
are
many
other
errors
found
in
the
precepts
and
practical
life
of
jesus
christ
which
we
are
compelled
to
omit
an
exposition
of
here
such
as
his
losing
his
temper
and
abusing
the
by
overthrowing
their
and
expelling
them
from
the
temple
with
a
whip
of
cords
when
engaged
in
a
lawful
and
laudable
business
his
getting
mad
at
and
cursing
the
fig
tree
his
dooming
capernaum
to
hell
in
a
fit
of
anger
his
being
deceived
by
two
of
his
disciples
peter
and
judas
which
prompted
him
to
call
them
devils
his
implied
approval
of
david
with
his
fourteen
crimes
and
penitentiary
deeds
and
also
abraham
with
his
falsehoods
polygamy
and
incest
and
his
implied
sanction
of
the
old
testament
with
all
its
errors
and
numerous
crimes
his
promise
to
his
twelve
apostles
to
sit
upon
the
twelve
thrones
of
israel
in
heaven
thus
evincing
a
very
limited
and
childish
conception
of
the
enjoyments
of
the
future
life
his
puerile
idea
of
sin
consisting
in
a
personal
affront
to
a
personal
god
his
omission
to
say
anything
about
human
freedom
the
inalienable
rights
of
man
the
scientific
errors
of
christ
that
jesus
christ
was
neither
a
natural
or
moral
philosopher
is
evident
from
the
following
facts
he
never
made
any
use
of
the
word
philosophy
never
gave
utterance
to
the
word
science
never
spoke
of
a
natural
law
or
assigned
a
natural
cause
for
anything
the
fact
that
he
never
made
use
of
these
words
now
so
current
in
all
civilized
countries
is
evidence
that
he
was
totally
ignorant
of
these
important
branches
of
knowledge
the
cultivation
of
which
is
now
known
to
be
essential
to
the
progress
of
civilization
and
yet
it
is
claimed
his
religion
has
been
a
great
lever
in
the
advancement
of
civilization
but
this
is
a
mistake
a
solemn
mistake
as
elsewhere
shown
see
chap
xlv
everything
to
christ
was
miracle
everything
was
produced
and
controlled
by
the
arbitrary
power
of
an
angry
or
irascible
god
he
evidently
had
no
idea
of
a
ruling
principle
in
nature
or
of
the
existence
of
natural
law
as
controlling
any
event
he
witnessed
hence
he
set
no
bounds
to
anything
and
recognized
no
limits
to
the
possible
he
believed
god
to
be
a
supernatural
personal
being
who
possessed
unlimited
power
and
who
ruled
and
controlled
everything
by
his
arbitrary
will
without
any
law
or
any
limitation
to
its
exercises
hence
he
told
his
disciples
they
would
have
anything
they
prayed
for
in
faith
that
by
faith
they
could
roll
mountains
into
the
sea
or
bring
to
a
halt
the
rolling
billows
of
the
mighty
deep
he
evidently
believed
that
the
forked
lightning
the
thunder
and
the
roaring
heaving
volcano
were
but
pliant
tools
or
obsequious
servants
to
the
man
of
faith
and
he
displays
no
less
ignorance
of
the
laws
of
mind
than
the
laws
of
nature
thus
proving
him
to
have
been
neither
a
natural
moral
nor
mental
philosopher
he
omitted
to
teach
the
great
moral
lessons
learned
by
human
experience
of
which
he
was
evidently
totally
ignorant
he
never
taught
that
the
practice
of
virtue
contains
its
own
reward
that
the
question
of
right
and
wrong
of
any
action
is
to
be
decided
by
its
effect
upon
the
individual
or
upon
society
that
no
life
can
be
displeasing
to
god
which
is
useful
to
man
and
he
omitted
to
teach
the
most
important
lesson
that
can
engage
the
attention
of
man
viz
that
the
great
purpose
of
life
is
that
no
person
can
attain
or
approximate
to
real
happiness
without
bestowing
a
special
attention
to
the
cultivation
and
exercise
of
all
the
mental
and
physical
faculties
so
far
as
to
keep
them
in
a
healthy
condition
none
of
the
important
lessons
above
named
are
hinted
at
in
his
teachings
which
if
punctually
observed
would
do
more
to
advance
the
happiness
of
the
human
race
than
all
the
sermons
christ
or
chrishna
ever
preached
or
ever
taught
and
then
he
taught
many
doctrines
which
are
plainly
contradicted
by
the
established
principle
of
modern
science
such
as
diseases
being
produced
by
demons
devils
or
wicked
spirits
see
mark
ix
christ
nowhere
assigns
a
natural
cause
for
disease
or
a
scientific
explanation
for
its
cure
his
rebuking
a
fever
discloses
a
similar
lack
of
scientific
knowledge
see
luke
iv
his
belief
in
a
literal
hell
and
a
lake
of
fire
and
brimstone
see
matt
xviii
is
an
ancient
heathen
superstition
science
knows
nothing
about
and
has
no
use
for
his
belief
in
a
personal
devil
also
see
matt
xvii
which
is
another
oriental
tradition
furnishes
more
sad
proof
of
an
utter
want
of
scientific
knowledge
as
science
has
no
place
for
and
no
use
for
such
a
being
christ
taught
the
unphilosophical
doctrine
of
repentance
as
he
declared
he
came
to
call
sinners
to
repentance
matt
ix
a
mental
process
which
consists
merely
in
a
revival
of
early
impressions
and
often
leads
a
person
to
condemn
that
which
is
right
as
well
as
that
which
is
wrong
for
proof
see
chapter
xliii
the
doctrine
of
forgiveness
which
christ
so
often
inculcated
is
also
at
variance
with
the
teachings
of
science
as
it
can
do
nothing
toward
changing
the
nature
of
the
act
forgiven
or
toward
cancelling
its
previous
effects
upon
society
science
teaches
that
every
crime
has
its
penalty
attached
to
it
which
no
act
of
forgiveness
by
god
or
man
can
arrest
or
set
aside
but
nothing
evinces
perhaps
more
clearly
christ
total
lack
of
scientific
knowledge
than
his
holding
a
man
responsible
for
his
belief
and
condemning
for
disbelief
as
he
does
in
numerous
instances
see
mark
xvi
for
a
man
could
as
easily
control
the
circulation
of
the
blood
in
his
veins
as
control
his
belief
science
teaches
that
belief
depends
upon
evidence
and
without
it
it
is
impossible
to
believe
and
with
it
it
is
impossible
to
disbelieve
how
foolish
and
unphilosophical
therefore
to
condemn
for
either
belief
or
disbelief
the
numerous
cases
in
which
christ
speaks
of
the
heart
as
being
the
seat
of
consciousness
instead
of
the
brain
evinces
a
remarkable
ignorance
of
the
science
of
mental
philosophy
he
speaks
of
an
upright
heart
a
pure
heart
when
an
upright
liver
a
pure
liver
would
be
as
sensible
as
the
latter
has
as
much
to
do
with
the
character
as
the
former
and
the
many
cases
in
which
he
makes
it
meritorious
to
have
a
right
faith
and
places
it
above
reason
and
assumes
it
to
be
a
voluntary
act
shows
his
utter
ignorance
of
the
nature
of
the
human
mind
and
christ
evinced
a
remarkable
ignorance
of
the
cause
of
physical
defects
when
he
told
his
hearers
a
certain
man
was
born
blind
in
order
that
he
might
cure
him
matt
vii
and
christ
declaration
that
those
who
marry
are
not
worthy
of
being
saved
see
luke
xx
shows
that
he
was
very
ignorant
of
the
nature
of
the
sexual
functions
of
the
human
system
nothing
could
more
completely
demonstrate
a
total
ignorance
of
the
grand
science
of
astronomy
than
christ
prediction
of
the
stars
falling
to
the
earth
see
luke
xxi
and
the
conflagration
of
the
world
the
gathering
of
the
elect
and
the
realization
of
a
fancied
millennium
which
he
several
times
predicted
would
take
place
in
his
time
before
this
generation
pass
away
matt
xxiv
proves
a
like
ignorance
both
of
astronomy
and
philosophy
and
his
cursing
of
the
fig
tree
for
not
bearing
fruit
in
the
winter
season
see
matt
xxi
not
only
proves
his
ignorance
of
the
laws
of
nature
but
evinces
a
bad
temper
christ
indorses
the
truth
of
noah
flood
story
see
luke
xvii
which
every
person
at
the
present
day
versed
in
science
and
natural
law
knows
is
mere
fiction
and
never
took
place
and
numerous
other
errors
evincing
the
most
profound
ignorance
of
science
and
natural
law
might
be
pointed
out
in
christ
teachings
if
we
had
space
for
them
it
has
always
been
alleged
by
orthodox
christendom
that
christ
teaching
and
moral
system
are
so
faultless
as
to
challenge
criticism
and
so
perfect
as
to
defy
improvement
but
this
is
a
serious
mistake
for
most
of
his
precepts
and
moral
inculcations
which
are
not
directly
at
war
with
the
principles
of
science
or
do
not
involve
a
flagrant
violation
of
the
laws
of
nature
are
nevertheless
characterized
by
a
lawless
and
extravagant
mode
of
expression
peculiar
to
life
and
which
as
it
renders
it
impossible
to
reduce
them
to
practice
shows
they
could
not
have
emanated
from
a
philosopher
or
man
of
science
or
a
man
of
mind
they
impose
upon
the
world
a
system
of
morality
pushed
to
such
extremes
that
its
own
professed
admirers
do
not
live
it
out
or
even
attempt
to
do
so
they
long
ago
abandoned
it
as
an
impracticable
duty
we
will
prove
this
by
enumerating
most
of
its
requisitions
and
showing
that
they
are
daily
violated
and
trampled
under
foot
by
all
christendom
where
can
the
christian
professor
be
found
who
takes
no
thought
for
the
morrow
or
who
lays
not
up
treasure
on
earth
or
at
least
tries
to
do
it
or
who
gives
up
all
his
property
to
the
poor
or
who
when
his
cloak
is
wrested
from
him
by
a
robber
gives
up
his
coat
also
or
who
calls
no
man
master
or
mister
the
most
common
title
in
christendom
or
who
calls
no
man
father
if
he
has
a
father
or
who
calls
no
man
a
fool
when
he
knows
he
is
a
fool
or
who
when
one
cheek
is
pommeled
into
a
jelly
by
some
vile
miscreant
or
drunken
wretch
turns
the
other
to
be
battered
up
in
the
same
way
or
who
prays
without
ceasing
or
who
rejoices
when
persecuted
or
who
forgives
an
enemy
four
hundred
and
ninety
times
times
or
who
manifests
by
his
practical
life
that
he
loves
his
enemies
the
way
he
loves
him
is
to
report
him
to
the
grand
jury
or
hand
him
over
to
the
sheriff
or
who
forsakes
houses
and
land
and
everything
for
the
kingdom
of
heaven
sake
no
christian
professor
lives
up
to
these
precepts
or
any
of
them
or
even
tries
to
do
so
to
talk
therefore
of
finding
a
practical
christian
while
nearly
the
whole
moral
code
of
christ
is
thus
daily
and
habitually
outraged
and
trampled
under
foot
by
all
the
churches
and
every
one
of
the
two
hundred
millions
of
christian
professors
is
bitter
irony
and
supreme
solecism
we
would
go
five
hundred
miles
or
pay
five
hundred
dollars
to
see
a
christian
if
a
man
can
be
a
christian
while
openly
and
habitually
violating
every
precept
of
christ
then
the
word
has
no
meaning
these
precepts
the
christian
world
finding
to
be
impossible
to
practice
have
unanimously
laid
upon
the
table
under
the
rule
of
indefinite
postponement
they
are
the
product
of
a
mind
with
an
ardent
temperament
and
the
religious
faculties
developed
to
excess
and
unrestrained
by
scientific
or
intellectual
culture
a
similar
vein
of
extravagant
religious
duty
is
found
in
the
essenian
budhist
and
pythagorean
systems
as
zera
colburn
possessed
the
mathematical
faculty
to
excess
and
jenny
lind
the
musical
talent
christ
in
like
manner
was
all
religion
and
from
the
extreme
ardor
of
his
religious
feeling
thus
derived
sprang
his
extravagant
notions
of
the
duties
of
life
this
peculiarity
of
his
organization
explains
the
whole
mystery
christ
as
a
man
and
christ
as
a
sectarian
to
every
observant
and
unbiased
mind
a
strange
contrast
must
be
visible
in
the
practical
life
of
jesus
christ
when
viewed
in
his
twofold
capacity
of
a
man
and
a
priest
while
standing
upon
the
broad
plane
of
humanity
with
his
deep
sympathetic
nature
directed
toward
the
poor
the
unfortunate
and
the
downtrodden
there
often
gushed
forth
from
his
impassioned
bosom
the
most
sublime
expressions
of
pity
and
the
strongest
outburst
of
commiseration
for
wrongs
and
sufferings
and
his
noble
goodness
and
tender
love
yearned
with
a
throbbing
heart
to
relieve
them
but
the
moment
he
put
on
the
sacerdotal
robe
and
assumed
the
character
of
a
priest
that
moment
if
any
one
crossed
his
path
by
refusing
to
yield
to
his
requisitions
of
faith
or
dissented
from
his
religious
creed
his
whole
nature
was
seemingly
changed
it
was
no
longer
blessed
are
ye
but
cursed
are
ye
or
woe
unto
you
like
the
founders
of
other
religious
systems
he
was
ardent
toward
friends
and
bitter
toward
enemies
and
extolled
his
own
religion
while
he
denounced
all
others
his
way
was
the
only
way
and
all
who
did
not
walk
threin
or
conform
thereto
were
loaded
with
curses
and
imprecations
and
all
who
could
not
accomplish
the
impossible
mental
achievement
of
believing
everything
he
set
forth
or
urged
upon
their
credence
and
that
too
without
evidence
were
to
be
eternally
damned
all
who
climbed
up
any
other
way
were
thieves
and
robbers
all
who
professed
faith
in
any
other
religion
than
his
were
on
the
road
to
hell
like
the
oriental
gods
he
taught
that
the
world
was
to
be
saved
through
faith
in
him
and
his
religion
all
who
did
not
honor
him
were
to
be
dishonored
by
the
father
and
without
faith
in
him
and
his
religion
it
is
impossible
to
please
god
he
declared
that
all
who
were
not
for
him
were
against
him
and
all
who
were
not
on
the
same
road
are
heathens
and
publicans
his
disciples
were
enjoined
to
shake
off
the
dust
from
their
feet
as
a
manifestation
of
displeasure
toward
those
who
could
not
conscientiously
subscribe
to
their
creeds
and
dogmas
thus
we
discover
a
strong
vein
of
intolerance
and
sectarianism
in
the
religion
of
the
otherwise
and
in
other
respects
the
kind
and
loving
jesus
though
most
benignantly
kind
and
affectionate
while
moving
and
acting
under
the
controlling
impulses
of
his
lofty
manhood
yet
when
his
ardent
religious
feelings
were
touched
he
became
chafed
irritated
and
sometimes
intolerant
he
then
could
tolerate
no
such
thing
as
liberty
of
conscience
or
freedom
of
thought
or
the
right
to
differ
with
him
in
religious
belief
his
extremely
ardent
devotional
nature
when
roused
into
action
in
defense
of
a
stereotyped
faith
eclipsed
his
more
noble
lofty
and
lovely
traits
and
often
dimmed
his
mental
vision
thus
presenting
in
the
same
individual
a
strange
medley
and
a
strange
contrast
of
the
most
opposite
traits
of
character
that
such
a
being
should
have
been
considered
and
worshipped
as
a
god
and
for
the
very
reason
that
he
possessed
such
strange
contradictory
traits
of
character
and
often
let
his
religion
run
riot
with
his
reason
will
be
looked
upon
by
posterity
as
one
of
the
strangest
chapters
in
the
history
of
the
human
race
but
so
it
is
extraordinary
good
qualities
though
intermingled
with
many
errors
and
human
foibles
have
deified
many
men
note
one
christian
writer
alleges
in
defense
of
the
objectionable
precepts
of
jesus
christ
that
he
taught
some
errors
in
condescension
to
the
ignorance
of
the
people
if
this
be
true
that
he
taught
both
truth
and
falsehood
then
the
question
arises
how
can
we
know
which
is
which
by
what
rule
can
we
discriminate
them
as
he
himself
furnishes
none
or
how
are
we
to
determine
that
he
taught
truth
at
all
and
then
this
plea
would
account
for
and
excuse
all
the
errors
found
in
the
teachings
of
the
oriental
gods
if
it
will
apply
in
one
case
it
will
in
the
other
and
thus
it
proves
too
much
chapter
xlii
christ
as
a
spiritual
medium
there
are
many
incidents
related
in
the
life
of
christ
which
when
critically
examined
furnish
abundant
evidence
that
he
was
what
is
now
known
as
a
spiritual
medium
he
unquestionably
represented
and
often
practically
exhibited
several
important
phases
of
modern
mediumship
the
many
instantaneous
cures
which
he
wrought
as
reported
in
his
gospel
narrative
performed
in
the
same
manner
that
spirit
doctors
now
heal
the
sick
prove
that
he
was
an
excellent
healing
medium
his
declaration
to
nathanael
when
thou
wast
under
the
fig
tree
i
saw
thee
and
his
recounting
to
the
woman
of
samaria
the
deeds
of
her
past
life
acts
similar
to
which
are
now
performed
every
day
by
spiritualists
are
evidence
that
he
was
also
a
clairvoyant
medium
his
walking
on
the
water
if
the
story
is
true
as
home
has
frequently
within
the
past
few
years
walked
or
floated
on
the
air
in
the
presence
of
many
witnesses
including
men
of
science
royal
personages
and
members
of
parliament
entitles
him
to
the
appellation
of
a
physical
medium
and
the
circumstance
of
his
pointing
his
disciples
to
the
mark
of
the
spear
in
his
side
and
the
print
of
the
nails
in
his
hands
while
amongst
them
as
a
spirit
has
led
many
spiritualists
to
conclude
he
was
also
a
medium
for
materialization
his
spirit
was
made
to
present
the
peculiar
marks
which
had
been
inflicted
upon
his
physical
body
cases
parallel
to
which
are
now
witnessed
every
day
by
modern
spiritualists
hundreds
of
cases
have
occurred
of
departed
spirits
presenting
themselves
to
their
friends
with
all
the
peculiar
marks
which
their
physical
bodies
had
long
worn
while
in
the
earth
life
and
the
former
physical
wounds
have
often
been
exhibited
by
the
spirit
in
the
same
manner
christ
exhibited
his
and
thus
spiritualism
explains
the
phenomenon
which
otherwise
would
be
entirely
incredible
and
there
is
yet
another
phase
of
mediumship
which
christ
often
exhibited
in
his
practical
life
he
claimed
to
have
frequent
intercourse
with
some
invisible
being
whom
he
called
the
father
but
as
modern
science
has
settled
the
question
of
the
personality
of
god
in
the
negative
we
are
led
to
conclude
that
christ
like
many
eminent
persons
since
his
time
mistook
some
finite
spirit
for
the
great
infinite
but
impersonal
father
spirit
though
his
attendant
invisible
companion
was
probably
a
spirit
of
a
very
high
order
and
the
great
beauty
and
grandeur
of
his
life
are
exhibited
by
his
frequent
intercourse
with
and
dependence
upon
this
his
guardian
spirit
he
declared
he
did
nothing
of
himself
so
dependent
was
he
upon
his
invisible
guide
and
the
strongest
proof
that
he
had
a
spirit
companion
which
he
often
looked
to
for
counsel
and
aid
and
that
this
was
the
being
he
called
the
father
is
furnished
by
the
fact
that
when
he
prayed
to
the
father
his
petition
was
answered
by
an
angel
spirit
see
luke
xxii
and
there
is
no
account
and
no
evidence
of
any
invisible
or
spiritual
being
ever
presenting
itself
to
him
but
an
angel
or
spirit
that
he
should
have
supposed
this
spirit
to
be
the
great
infinite
father
god
was
very
natural
thousands
since
and
some
before
his
time
committed
a
similar
mistake
the
author
has
known
several
persons
who
had
long
had
intercourse
with
some
invisible
being
they
supposed
to
be
god
who
have
recently
by
the
light
afforded
by
modern
spiritualism
become
entirely
convinced
that
they
had
simply
mistaken
a
finite
spirit
for
the
great
infinite
spirit
and
did
christ
live
in
our
day
he
would
probably
be
rescued
from
a
similar
error
in
the
same
way
in
conclusion
we
will
remark
that
it
was
doubtless
his
frequent
displays
of
several
very
remarkable
phases
of
spiritual
mediumship
that
contributed
much
to
lead
the
people
into
the
error
of
supposing
him
to
be
god
and
this
fact
will
yet
be
known

conversion
repentance
and
getting
religion
of
heathen
origin
their
numerous
evils
and
absurdities
of
all
the
follies
ever
enacted
or
exhibited
under
the
sun
and
of
all
the
ignorance
of
history
science
and
human
nature
ever
displayed
in
the
history
of
the
human
race
that
which
stands
out
in
bold
relief
as
is
the
fashionable
custom
of
conversion
or
getting
religion
when
the
evidence
lies
all
around
us
as
thick
as
the
fallen
leaves
of
autumn
clustering
on
the
pages
of
history
and
proclaimed
by
every
principle
of
mental
science
that
what
is
called
conversion
is
nothing
but
a
mental
and
temperamental
or
nervous
phenomenon
a
psychological
process
how
can
we
rank
those
amongst
intelligent
people
who
still
claim
it
to
be
the
power
of
god
operating
upon
the
soul
of
the
sinner
ignorance
is
the
only
plea
that
can
acquit
them
of
the
charge
of
imbecility
the
number
who
daily
fall
victims
to
this
priestly
delusion
in
various
parts
of
the
country
may
be
reckoned
by
thousands
we
propose
in
this
chapter
to
exhibit
some
of
the
evils
and
absurdities
of
this
widespread
delusion
and
religious
to
do
so
the
more
effectually
we
will
arrange
the
presentation
of
the
subject
under
four
separate
heads
we
will
attempt
to
show
its
historical
errors
its
logical
errors
its
philosophical
or
scientific
errors
its
moral
evils
historical
can
we
conceive
it
possible
that
the
thousands
of
priests
who
are
now
employed
in
converting
souls
to
god
are
so
ignorant
of
history
as
not
to
know
that
it
is
an
old
pagan
custom
that
it
was
prevalent
in
heathen
countries
long
before
a
single
soul
was
converted
to
christianity
and
is
carried
on
to
some
extent
now
both
among
pagans
and
mahomedans
from
such
facts
it
would
appear
viewing
the
matter
from
the
christian
that
god
is
indifferent
as
to
what
kind
of
religion
or
what
sort
of
religious
nonsense
people
are
converted
to
or
whether
it
is
truth
or
error
they
embrace
or
whether
it
is
a
true
religion
or
a
false
one
they
imbibe
so
he
gets
them
converted
according
to
higgins
the
practice
of
converting
people
from
one
sect
to
another
by
the
popular
priesthood
was
prevalent
under
the
ancient
persian
system
and
was
carried
on
there
quite
extensively
more
than
three
thousand
years
ago
and
the
process
was
essentially
the
same
as
that
now
in
vogue
amongst
modem
methodists
and
the
effect
the
same
at
their
large
revival
meetings
the
whole
congregation
would
sometimes
become
so
affected
under
the
eloquent
ministrations
of
the
officiating
priest
as
to
cry
and
shout
and
prostrate
themselves
upon
the
ground
which
was
afterward
found
to
be
drenched
with
their
tears
and
on
these
occasions
they
would
confess
their
sins
to
each
other
and
to
their
priests
and
yet
those
very
sins
they
condemned
were
perhaps
amongst
the
best
acts
of
their
lives
while
their
real
crimes
were
overlooked
and
justified
instead
of
being
condemned
thus
showing
that
an
honest
just
and
sensible
god
could
have
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
and
we
have
reports
of
similar
scenes
witnessed
more
recently
among
the
mahomedans
major
denham
furnishes
us
an
account
of
some
revival
meetings
he
attended
a
few
years
since
in
arabia
carried
on
by
one
of
the
mahomedan
sects
on
one
occasion
the
effect
of
the
discourse
of
the
preacher
upon
the
audience
in
the
way
of
converting
souls
to
god
was
so
powerful
that
he
could
only
convince
himself
that
he
was
not
in
a
methodist
revival
meeting
by
a
knowledge
of
his
geographical
position
the
preacher
name
was
malem
chadily
and
here
is
a
specimen
of
some
of
his
language
turn
turn
sinner
unto
god
confess
he
is
good
and
that
mahomet
is
his
prophet
wash
and
become
clean
of
your
sins
and
paradise
is
open
before
you
without
this
nothing
can
save
you
from
eternal
fire
during
this
earnest
appeal
says
the
major
tears
flowed
plentifully
and
everybody
appeared
to
be
affected
one
of
his
hearers
becoming
converted
shouted
your
words
pierce
my
soul
and
fell
upon
the
floor
now
let
it
be
borne
in
mind
that
mahomet
is
stigmatized
and
condemned
by
the
christian
churches
as
a
false
prophet
and
his
religion
denounced
as
a
system
of
fraud
a
false
religion
of
course
then
christians
will
not
argue
nor
admit
that
conversion
and
getting
religion
in
this
case
is
the
work
of
god
a
just
god
would
have
nothing
to
do
in
converting
people
to
a
false
religion
what
explanation
shall
we
adopt
for
it
then
to
assume
it
to
be
the
work
of
the
devil
the
dernier
resort
for
all
religious
difficulties
and
conversions
among
christians
the
work
of
god
when
both
are
so
clearly
and
obviously
alike
is
to
insult
common
sense
to
assume
that
two
things
exactly
alike
in
character
can
be
exactly
and
diametrically
unlike
in
origin
is
a
scientific
paradox
which
no
person
of
common
intelligence
can
swallow
or
accept
for
a
moment
both
then
we
must
admit
have
the
same
origin
this
train
of
argument
leads
us
to
speak
of
logical
absurdities
of
the
doctrine
of
there
are
several
circumstances
which
point
unmistakably
as
the
needle
to
the
pole
to
the
mundane
origin
of
the
phenomenon
of
conversion
the
character
of
many
of
the
priestly
conductors
who
run
the
battery
is
sufficient
of
itself
to
preclude
the
hypothesis
of
any
divine
agency
in
the
matter
the
most
powerful
revivalist
we
ever
knew
the
priest
who
could
convert
an
audience
the
quickest
and
bring
down
sinners
to
the
mourners
bench
faster
than
any
other
clergyman
we
ever
heard
dealing
out
damnation
to
the
people
was
a
muscular
circuit
rider
of
the
buckeye
state
who
as
was
afterward
learned
was
guilty
of
perpetrating
some
of
the
blackest
crimes
that
ever
blotted
the
page
of
human
history
at
the
very
time
of
his
most
successful
career
in
the
way
of
convicting
souls
of
sin
and
converting
them
to
god
he
was
apprehended
by
the
officers
of
the
law
in
the
midst
of
one
of
his
most
flourishing
revivals
under
the
twofold
charge
i
of
being
the
father
of
an
illegitimate
child
the
young
mother
of
which
was
a
member
of
his
church
of
defrauding
one
of
his
neighbors
in
a
trade
to
the
amount
of
nearly
a
thousand
dollars
both
of
which
charges
he
was
convicted
of
a
similar
case
but
possessing
some
worse
features
occurred
a
few
years
since
in
the
county
in
which
the
author
now
resides
a
preacher
who
had
had
criminal
connection
with
a
young
woman
of
his
church
in
order
to
conceal
his
guilt
resorted
to
the
damnable
expedient
of
administering
poison
to
his
victim
shortly
before
his
illicit
intercourse
with
her
would
have
been
made
manifest
by
the
birth
of
a
child
thus
committing
a
double
murder
he
was
apprehended
for
the
crime
while
carrying
on
a
most
glorious
revival
as
it
was
styled
by
some
of
the
deluded
congregation
now
to
ascribe
the
irresistible
power
which
these
two
preachers
exerted
over
their
audience
in
the
way
of
converting
them
to
god
to
a
divine
source
as
they
claimed
for
it
would
be
to
trifle
with
common
sense
common
decency
and
all
honorable
conceptions
of
a
god
these
reverend
scamps
often
instituted
the
high
claim
of
being
called
of
god
to
their
ministerial
labors
but
if
we
concede
the
claim
we
should
have
to
conclude
that
god
knew
but
little
about
them
for
he
certainly
would
not
knowingly
employ
such
moral
outlaws
upon
such
an
important
mission
having
thus
briefly
spoken
of
the
character
of
some
of
the
actors
and
agents
in
the
work
of
conversion
we
will
now
glance
at
the
character
of
some
of
the
religions
and
religious
ideas
and
moral
course
of
conduct
to
which
the
sinner
is
converted
it
is
evident
that
if
an
god
had
anything
to
do
in
the
process
of
converting
people
to
any
system
of
religion
he
would
also
convert
them
to
correct
moral
habits
but
in
many
cases
after
conversion
they
are
no
nearer
right
in
this
respect
and
in
some
cases
further
from
it
than
before
being
thus
sanctified
in
some
cases
their
religion
becomes
worse
their
religious
ideas
less
sensible
and
their
moral
conduct
more
objectionable
by
the
change
of
heart
in
getting
religion
spencer
informs
us
that
the
vewas
a
sect
or
tribe
of
the
feegees
often
cry
for
hours
under
conviction
for
sin
and
what
is
that
sin
why
the
neglect
to
offer
sacrifices
to
their
god
and
those
sacrifices
consist
in
human
beings
sometimes
their
own
children
and
their
conviction
conversion
and
repentance
only
make
them
more
diligent
in
practicing
this
crime
it
is
evident
then
that
their
religion
is
at
war
with
their
humanity
and
the
former
always
triumphs
in
the
contest
they
are
addicted
to
cannibalism
infanticide
and
polygamy
but
as
the
process
of
getting
religion
never
makes
anybody
more
intelligent
the
change
of
heart
with
the
vewas
never
changes
their
views
or
opens
their
eyes
to
see
the
enormity
of
their
crimes
in
getting
religion
people
get
neither
sense
knowledge
nor
morality
they
get
neither
a
larger
stock
nor
an
improved
quality
of
either
their
moral
conduct
is
not
often
sensibly
improved
materially
or
permanently
errors
and
scientific
explanations
of
the
phenomena
of
conversion
and
getting
religion
are
so
easily
explained
in
the
light
of
science
and
philosophy
and
that
explanation
is
susceptible
of
so
many
proofs
and
demonstrations
that
it
seems
remarkably
strange
that
any
persons
claiming
to
be
intelligent
and
situated
in
the
focal
scientific
light
of
the
nineteenth
century
should
still
be
hampered
with
the
delusion
that
such
phenomena
are
the
direct
display
of
the
power
of
god
it
requires
but
little
investigation
and
reflection
to
convince
any
person
that
what
is
called
conversion
and
repentance
for
sin
is
nothing
but
the
revival
of
early
educational
impressions
resuscitated
by
the
influence
of
mind
on
mind
no
person
has
ever
been
known
to
get
or
embrace
a
religion
he
was
not
biased
in
favor
of
prior
to
the
time
of
his
conversion
unless
we
except
a
few
persons
negative
to
any
influence
and
convertible
to
any
religion
the
priest
may
urge
upon
their
attention
a
very
strong
proof
of
this
statement
is
furnished
by
the
history
of
the
christian
missionary
enterprise
the
reports
of
travelers
and
sojourners
in
india
show
that
with
two
hundred
years
labor
and
two
hundred
missionaries
in
the
field
during
a
part
of
that
period
the
churches
have
not
succeeded
in
converting
one
in
ten
thousand
of
the
hindoos
to
the
christian
religion
unless
we
except
those
who
while
children
were
sent
to
christian
schools
instituted
by
the
missionaries
for
the
special
purpose
of
converting
and
warping
the
young
mind
and
welding
it
to
the
christian
faith
before
it
should
receive
an
unchangeable
and
unyielding
bias
in
favor
of
another
religion
so
fruitless
has
been
the
effort
to
convert
to
christianity
those
who
were
already
established
in
the
religion
of
the
country
that
according
to
the
estimate
of
colonel
dow
each
convert
on
an
average
has
cost
the
missionary
enterprise
not
less
than
ten
thousand
dollars
an
intelligent
hindoo
while
lecturing
recently
in
london
made
the
remarkable
statement
that
conversions
which
are
made
to
the
christian
religion
are
not
amongst
the
intelligent
or
learned
classes
but
are
confined
to
the
low
ignorant
and
superstitious
classes
who
have
not
sense
or
intelligence
enough
to
perceive
the
difference
between
the
they
are
converted
to
and
that
which
they
are
converted
and
the
effort
to
convert
the
mahomedans
chinese
persians
and
the
disciples
of
other
religions
has
been
attended
with
the
same
fruitless
results
all
seeming
to
warrant
the
conclusion
that
god
can
do
but
little
toward
converting
any
nation
to
christianity
which
has
always
been
biased
in
favor
of
another
religion
the
reason
why
people
are
so
easily
converted
from
one
sect
to
another
in
christian
countries
is
owing
to
the
fact
that
their
religious
convictions
are
unsettled
the
members
of
the
different
christian
sects
are
all
mixed
up
together
in
the
various
settlements
throughout
the
country
and
are
brought
in
daily
contact
with
each
other
in
the
busy
scenes
of
life
hence
the
children
have
the
seeds
of
methodism
presbyterianism
baptistism
quakerism
and
various
other
isms
implanted
in
their
minds
in
very
early
life
and
which
one
of
these
will
ultimately
predominate
depends
upon
what
priest
they
fall
victims
to
first
having
thus
the
germs
of
so
many
religious
isms
implanted
in
their
minds
they
are
easily
shifted
about
and
converted
from
one
sect
to
another
and
this
shuttlecock
process
is
called
getting
religion
while
if
they
had
lived
in
a
country
where
only
one
form
of
religion
exists
they
would
be
as
hard
to
convert
as
mahomedans
and
hindoos
much
importance
is
attached
by
the
orthodox
churches
to
the
act
of
getting
religion
in
the
dying
hour
called
repentance
as
if
the
person
were
better
capable
of
discriminating
between
right
and
wrong
when
his
brain
is
deranged
with
fever
and
his
whole
system
racked
with
disease
and
pain
than
when
in
health
such
repentance
can
do
nothing
more
than
prove
the
honesty
of
the
dying
man
or
woman
for
very
often
their
doctrines
or
religious
belief
will
be
found
no
nearer
right
and
sometimes
more
erroneous
after
repentance
than
before
as
repentance
merely
consists
in
the
return
to
early
impressions
the
revival
of
former
convictions
which
may
be
either
right
or
wrong
and
are
about
as
likely
to
be
the
latter
as
the
former
no
instance
can
be
found
of
a
person
condemning
a
wrong
act
or
a
wrong
course
of
life
in
his
dying
moments
unless
he
had
previously
believed
it
to
be
wrong
or
if
he
had
always
believed
it
to
be
right
how
much
then
does
repentance
do
toward
deciding
what
is
right
and
what
is
wrong
mahomedanism
we
know
to
be
deeply
fraught
with
error
but
we
never
read
nor
heard
of
an
instance
of
the
many
millions
who
had
been
educated
to
believe
it
is
right
condemning
it
on
their
or
repenting
for
not
having
embraced
christianity
and
led
the
life
of
a
christian
or
for
adoring
mahomet
instead
of
jesus
christ
on
the
contrary
we
have
a
instance
of
a
mahomedan
a
merton
who
had
embraced
christianity
and
lived
the
life
of
a
christian
for
many
years
renouncing
it
all
and
returning
to
his
primitive
faith
when
he
was
taken
sick
and
became
apprehensive
he
was
going
to
die
his
early
religious
impressions
returning
involuntarily
wiped
out
his
christianity
and
he
died
glorying
in
mahomedanism
and
we
have
an
equally
well
authenticated
case
of
an
indian
of
the
choctaw
tribe
who
had
been
taught
to
believe
from
early
life
that
the
white
man
was
his
natural
enemy
and
that
it
was
his
right
and
duty
to
kill
him
repenting
on
his
for
having
a
short
time
previously
neglected
when
the
opportunity
presented
to
despatch
a
pale
face
he
met
in
his
travels
instead
of
killing
him
he
yielded
for
the
moment
to
the
impulse
of
his
better
feelings
and
passed
him
by
but
on
reviewing
his
past
life
at
the
approach
of
death
he
came
to
the
conclusion
he
had
sinned
in
omitting
to
kill
this
man
and
he
grieved
and
lamented
sorely
over
this
dereliction
of
apprehended
duty
here
we
have
a
case
of
repentance
sanctioning
murder
must
we
therefore
conclude
that
murder
is
morally
right
or
a
righteous
act
certainly
according
to
orthodox
logic
their
religious
tracts
assume
that
repentance
is
always
for
the
right
and
is
evidence
of
being
right
if
not
what
does
it
prove
or
what
moral
value
is
it
according
to
orthodox
teaching
being
a
murderer
at
heart
he
was
as
consignable
to
perdition
as
if
he
had
committed
the
act
there
is
no
escaping
the
conclusion
therefore
that
his
repentance
landed
him
in
hell
or
else
proves
murder
to
be
right
according
to
orthodox
logic
we
have
known
quakers
to
leave
their
dying
testimony
against
water
baptism
and
baptists
with
their
last
breath
declare
it
is
right
and
a
sin
to
neglect
it
which
is
right
who
can
tell
we
have
also
known
quakers
to
condemn
dancing
in
their
dying
hours
but
shakers
never
because
one
had
been
taught
that
it
is
wrong
and
the
other
that
it
is
right
and
which
testimony
must
we
accept
mahomedans
often
when
approaching
the
confines
of
time
repent
sometimes
in
tears
for
not
having
lived
out
more
rigidly
the
injunctions
of
the
koran
but
never
regret
not
having
been
christians
they
often
call
upon
mohamet
to
aid
them
through
the
gates
of
death
but
not
one
of
the
million
who
die
every
year
ever
calls
upon
jesus
christ
what
then
does
such
a
conflicting
jargon
of
repentance
prove
what
good
can
grow
out
of
it
or
what
moral
value
can
possibly
attach
to
it
it
establishes
simply
two
principles
that
repentance
grows
out
of
education
that
it
depends
entirely
upon
previous
convictions
as
to
what
it
may
sanction
and
what
it
may
condemn
no
christian
ever
repents
in
favor
of
and
no
mahomedan
ever
lifts
up
his
dying
voice
in
favor
of
christianity
as
being
superior
to
his
own
religion
and
no
hindoo
has
ever
been
known
to
indulge
in
lamentation
for
not
having
previously
embraced
either
christianity
or
mahomedanism
because
their
earlier
education
never
turned
their
minds
in
that
direction
the
mind
has
to
be
educated
over
again
before
it
can
embrace
a
new
religion
or
even
condemn
a
wrong
act
which
up
to
that
period
it
had
always
believed
to
be
right
hence
it
is
evident
repentance
may
lead
a
person
to
condemn
what
is
right
and
sanction
what
is
wrong
how
profoundly
ignorant
of
religious
history
and
mental
science
must
those
persons
therefore
be
who
attach
any
importance
to
those
diseased
and
often
incoherent
utterances
called
recantations
or
who
believe
a
thing
the
sooner
because
sanctioned
by
a
dying
man
or
woman
or
that
they
do
anything
toward
proving
what
is
right
or
what
is
wrong
with
respect
to
either
our
belief
or
our
moral
conduct
and
yet
we
find
the
orthodox
churches
printing
every
year
through
their
tract
societies
stories
of
repentance
in
tract
form
and
scattering
them
over
the
country
by
the
million
as
they
prove
nothing
but
the
honesty
of
the
dying
man
or
woman
they
are
not
worth
the
paper
on
which
they
are
printed
the
phenomenon
of
repentance
is
simply
the
operation
of
a
natural
law
by
which
the
last
impressions
made
upon
the
mind
are
generally
cancelled
from
the
memory
first
by
the
progress
of
fever
and
disease
thus
leaving
the
earlier
impressions
to
rule
the
judgment
the
person
is
then
virtually
a
child
controlled
by
his
early
youthful
convictions
with
which
if
his
late
belief
and
conduct
disagree
it
causes
a
mental
conflict
called
repentance
thus
instead
of
being
the
visitation
of
god
as
christians
claim
repentance
is
shown
to
be
the
product
of
natural
causes
the
conclusion
is
thus
established
beyond
disproof
that
the
mental
processes
called
conversion
repentance
and
getting
religion
are
simply
natural
psychological
operations
depending
upon
education
organization
and
intelligence
they
depend
also
upon
intellect
and
scientific
knowledge
for
persons
of
large
intellectual
brains
or
extensive
scientific
culture
never
fall
victims
to
these
mental
derangements
hence
those
priests
who
claim
god
as
their
author
are
either
deplorably
and
inexcusably
ignorant
or
lacking
in
moral
honesty
chapter
xliv
the
moral
lessons
of
religious
history
the
most
important
lesson
deducible
from
all
the
religious
systems
commemorated
in
history
and
noticed
in
this
work
is
that
all
religious
conceptions
whether
in
the
shape
of
doctrine
precept
prophecy
prayer
religious
devotion
or
a
belief
in
miracles
are
a
spontaneous
outgrowth
of
the
moral
and
religious
elements
of
the
human
mind
and
to
assign
them
a
higher
origin
is
to
ignore
the
developments
of
modern
science
and
insult
the
highest
intelligence
of
the
age
from
the
elevated
scientific
plane
occupied
by
the
most
enlightened
portion
of
the
present
age
there
is
no
difficulty
in
finding
a
satisfactory
solution
for
every
event
every
occurrence
and
every
performance
recorded
in
any
of
the
numerous
bibles
which
have
long
been
afloat
in
the
world
and
which
have
always
constituted
the
sole
basis
for
the
claim
to
a
divine
origin
of
all
the
religious
systems
of
the
past
so
that
such
a
claim
can
be
no
longer
vindicated
by
historically
intelligent
people
we
have
shown
in
this
work
that
all
the
miraculous
incidents
related
in
the
history
of
jesus
christ
as
a
proof
of
his
divinity
can
find
a
more
rational
explanation
than
that
which
assigns
them
to
divine
agency
some
of
them
are
now
known
to
lie
within
the
natural
capacity
of
the
human
mind
to
achieve
others
are
explained
by
recently
discovered
natural
laws
another
class
are
now
well
understood
mental
or
nervous
phenomena
other
stories
now
regarded
by
the
christian
world
as
referring
to
miraculous
achievements
were
probably
designed
by
the
writer
as
mere
fable
or
metaphor
all
the
events
in
christ
history
we
have
shown
are
susceptible
of
a
hundred
fold
more
rational
explanation
than
that
which
regards
them
as
the
feats
of
a
god
in
violation
of
his
own
laws
we
have
also
shown
that
the
same
marvelous
incidents
now
found
incorporated
in
the
gospel
history
of
jesus
christ
were
related
long
previously
as
a
part
of
the
sacred
history
of
other
gods
such
as
being
miraculously
conceived
and
born
of
a
virgin
born
on
the
of
december
visited
in
infancy
by
angels
and
shepherds
threatened
by
the
ruler
of
the
country
being
of
royal
lineage
receiving
the
same
divine
titles
performing
the
same
miracles
in
a
word
we
have
shown
that
various
heathen
gods
and
demigods
had
long
before
christ
advent
filled
the
same
chapter
in
history
now
reported
of
him
in
the
christian
new
testament
all
these
stories
of
the
heathen
gods
prove
as
conclusively
as
any
scientific
problem
can
be
demonstrated
by
figures
that
the
same
stories
related
of
jesus
christ
have
no
other
foundation
than
that
of
heathen
tradition
and
will
the
christian
world
then
hereafter
stultify
their
common
sense
by
ignoring
these
facts
of
history
so
fatal
to
their
claims
past
history
points
to
an
affirmative
answer
to
this
question
as
we
will
illustrate
in
the
early
history
of
this
country
several
reports
were
published
of
showers
of
blood
being
seen
to
fall
in
some
of
the
states
which
were
regarded
as
a
divine
judgment
but
the
use
of
the
telescope
revealed
the
fact
that
it
was
the
ordure
of
butterflies
as
those
insects
were
seen
at
the
time
in
vast
swarms
but
the
devout
christian
whose
faith
in
his
religion
has
always
been
proof
against
the
demonstrations
of
science
would
give
it
up
he
would
not
accept
the
butterfly
explanation
but
continued
to
teach
his
children
that
it
came
from
god
out
of
heaven
as
a
manifestation
of
displeasure
toward
the
sins
of
the
people
and
it
now
remains
to
be
seen
whether
christian
professors
at
the
present
day
will
manifest
a
similar
folly
by
standing
out
against
the
demonstrated
truths
and
facts
of
this
work
we
here
cite
it
as
the
last
and
most
sorrowful
lesson
of
history
that
no
facts
no
proofs
no
demonstrations
of
science
can
eradicate
religious
errors
from
the
human
mind
if
instilled
in
early
life
and
never
disturbed
till
the
possessor
arrives
at
mature
age
or
middle
life
chapter

conclusion
and
review
in
writing
the
concluding
chapter
of
this
work
the
author
deems
it
proper
to
some
points
and
elaborate
others
and
anticipate
some
objections
to
some
of
the
positions
advanced
each
division
of
the
subject
will
be
marked
by
a
separate
figure
and
treated
in
a
brief
and
succinct
manner
as
follows
several
persons
who
examined
this
work
before
it
went
to
press
have
expressed
the
opinion
that
it
must
exert
a
powerful
influence
in
the
way
of
producing
an
entire
revolution
in
the
religion
of
orthodox
christendom
sooner
or
later
but
this
must
of
course
be
the
work
of
time
as
moral
revolutions
are
not
the
work
of
a
day
when
the
human
system
has
been
long
prostrated
with
chronic
disease
no
system
of
medication
can
restore
it
at
once
to
health
the
same
principle
governing
the
mind
makes
it
morally
impossible
to
eradicate
its
moral
and
religious
errors
in
a
day
by
even
the
presentation
of
the
most
powerful
and
convincing
truths
and
demonstrations
that
can
be
brought
to
bear
or
operate
upon
the
human
judgment
the
mind
instinctively
repels
everything
no
difference
how
true
or
how
beautiful
that
conflicts
with
its
opinions
and
convictions
the
fires
of
truth
usually
require
much
time
to
burn
their
way
through
those
incrustations
of
moral
and
religious
error
which
often
environ
the
human
mind
as
the
products
of
a
false
education
but
when
they
once
enter
the
work
of
convincement
is
complete
it
has
been
stated
that
the
resemblance
between
christianity
and
the
more
ancient
heathen
systems
is
complete
and
absolute
throughout
in
all
their
essential
doctrines
and
principles
and
precepts
and
if
it
shall
be
found
on
a
critical
reading
of
this
work
after
it
comes
from
the
press
that
there
is
one
feature
of
christianity
which
has
not
been
traced
to
pagan
origin
or
that
any
points
of
resemblance
have
been
omitted
they
will
be
supplied
in
an
appendix
it
has
been
stated
that
a
transfiguration
is
related
of
chrishna
of
india
in
the
hindoo
bible
the
baghavat
gita
which
is
strikingly
similar
to
that
of
christ
we
will
here
present
the
proof
abandoning
the
mortal
form
he
chrishna
appeared
to
his
disciples
in
all
the
divine
eclat
of
his
divine
majesty
his
brow
encircled
with
such
a
brilliant
light
that
adjouma
and
the
other
disciples
unable
to
bear
it
fell
with
their
faces
in
the
dust
and
prayed
the
lord
chrishna
to
pardon
their
unworthiness
he
replied
you
not
faith
in
me
know
ye
not
that
whether
present
or
absent
in
body
i
will
be
ever
present
with
you
to
guard
and
protect
you
gaghavat
gita
how
remarkable
this
to
the
story
of
christ
transfiguration
some
readers
perhaps
will
be
surprised
to
observe
that
we
have
named
so
many
crucified
gods
to
whom
some
writers
assign
a
different
death
but
we
have
followed
as
we
believe
the
best
authorities
in
doing
so
in
our
work
the
bibles
of
bibles
we
have
shown
that
the
score
of
bibles
which
have
been
extant
in
the
world
teach
essentially
the
same
doctrines
principles
and
precepts
there
are
to
be
found
in
the
old
pagan
bibles
the
same
grand
and
beautiful
truths
mixed
up
with
the
same
errors
and
deleterious
superstitions
as
those
contained
in
the
christian
bible
and
the
same
exalted
claim
is
set
up
by
the
disciples
of
each
for
their
respective
holy
books
that
of
being
a
direct
revelation
from
god
and
inspired
at
the
fountain
of
infinite
wisdom
and
all
were
exalted
adored
and
idolized
by
their
respective
admirers
as
containing
a
perfect
embodiment
of
truth
without
any
admixture
of
error
the
ancient
persians
carried
their
bibles
in
their
bosoms
and
read
them
and
prayed
over
them
daily
the
hindoos
often
read
their
bible
through
on
their
bended
knees
and
sometimes
committed
it
all
to
memory
the
baghavat
has
the
following
text
the
most
important
of
all
duties
is
to
study
the
holy
scriptures
which
is
the
word
of
brahma
and
chrishna
revealed
to
the
world
some
of
the
mahomedans
claim
that
immortal
life
can
only
be
obtained
by
reading
the
koran
and
that
the
reading
of
it
is
essential
to
the
progress
and
practice
of
good
morals
and
the
advancement
of
civilization
and
that
it
will
ultimately
reform
and
civilize
the
world
both
they
and
the
hindoos
like
the
christian
world
have
numerous
commentaries
explaining
the
obscure
texts
of
their
bibles
and
aiming
to
reconcile
their
teachings
with
reason
and
science
and
the
disciples
of
all
bibles
had
a
mode
of
doing
away
with
the
immoral
teachings
and
concealing
the
worst
features
of
their
sacred
books
by
bestowing
on
them
a
spiritual
meaning
as
christians
do
theirs
thus
dressing
up
error
in
the
guise
of
truth
the
hindoo
bible
the
mahomedan
bible
and
other
holy
books
consign
those
who
disbelieve
in
their
teachings
to
eternal
damnation
denouncing
them
as
infidels
in
this
respect
also
they
are
like
the
christian
bible
but
then
after
all
as
some
good
pious
christian
will
probably
exclaim
after
reading
this
work
the
bible
and
christianity
are
essential
to
the
progress
of
good
morals
and
the
advancement
of
the
cause
of
civilization
and
the
civilized
world
would
sink
into
a
state
of
heathen
darkness
demoralization
and
savagism
without
them
for
every
enlightened
nation
owes
its
present
moral
and
intellectual
greatness
to
the
christian
bible
and
the
christian
religion
and
would
relapse
into
barbarism
without
them
this
is
a
mistake
a
most
egregious
mistake
my
good
brother
christian
as
the
following
facts
of
history
will
show
there
are
heathen
nations
now
existing
who
never
saw
a
bible
and
others
which
flourished
in
the
past
before
our
bible
was
written
who
nevertheless
attained
to
a
higher
state
of
morals
and
a
higher
state
of
civilization
in
some
respects
than
any
christian
nation
known
to
history
a
whole
volume
of
facts
might
be
adduced
if
we
had
space
for
them
drawn
from
the
ablest
and
most
reliable
authorities
to
prove
that
india
egypt
greece
and
other
countries
had
reached
a
high
state
of
civilization
centuries
before
christianity
or
any
of
its
founders
were
even
heat
of
or
made
their
appearance
in
the
world
india
was
distinguished
for
her
teaming
her
laws
her
legislation
her
civil
courts
her
judicial
tribunals
her
astronomers
her
poets
her
philosophers
her
writers
her
moralists
her
libraries
her
men
of
literature
and
her
good
morals
before
moses
was
found
in
the
bulrushes
jacolliot
says
india
gave
civilization
to
the
world
egypt
borrowed
of
india
the
greeks
of
the
egyptians
and
the
jews
and
christians
are
indebted
to
the
greeks
for
both
their
morals
and
their
civilization
dubois
a
christian
missionary
in
his
memoirs
of
india
testifies
that
kindness
justice
humanity
good
faith
compassion
disinterestedness
and
in
fact
nearly
all
the
moral
virtues
were
familiar
to
the
ancient
brahmans
and
hindoos
and
they
taught
them
both
by
precept
and
example
can
as
much
be
said
of
any
christian
nation
certainly
not
and
the
rev
allen
says
they
were
distinguished
for
all
the
arts
and
refinement
of
civilized
life
thus
placing
them
on
the
highest
plane
of
civilization
and
moral
elevation
and
other
nations
might
be
referred
to
egypt
had
her
vast
temples
of
science
chaldea
her
astronomical
observatories
and
greece
her
distinguished
academies
of
learning
her
profound
philosophers
and
her
moral
writers
and
moral
teachers
while
the
jews
god
holy
people
were
in
a
state
of
semibarbarism
so
affirms
the
rev
albert
barnes
no
advancement
has
often
been
made
in
morals
or
civilization
in
any
country
by
the
introduction
of
the
christian
bible
or
the
christian
religion
it
is
the
arts
and
sciences
which
accompany
or
follow
the
bible
which
do
the
work
a
proof
of
this
statement
is
found
in
the
fact
that
no
improvement
takes
place
in
the
morals
of
the
people
by
the
introduction
of
the
bible
till
the
arts
and
sciences
are
also
introduced
amongst
them
on
the
contrary
the
morals
of
many
deteriorate
by
reading
the
bible
alone
because
it
sanctions
as
well
as
condemns
every
species
of
crime
then
known
to
society
for
proof
see
chap
xxxix
of
this
work
that
india
has
become
corrupted
and
sunk
in
morals
since
the
introduction
of
the
christian
bible
is
admitted
by
the
rev
allen
for
years
a
missionary
in
that
country
but
science
especially
moral
science
imparts
a
different
influence
it
explains
the
nature
of
crimes
and
teaches
and
demonstrates
that
a
life
of
honesty
and
virtue
can
alone
produce
true
and
real
happiness
while
the
bible
augments
the
temptation
to
commit
sin
by
teaching
that
it
is
a
sweet
morsel
to
be
rolled
under
the
tongue
and
that
its
punitive
effects
may
be
entirely
escaped
by
an
act
of
divine
forgiveness
but
science
either
directly
or
by
the
enlightening
of
the
mind
teaches
and
convinces
the
that
there
is
no
escape
from
the
evil
effects
of
a
wrong
or
wicked
act
and
that
sin
is
not
a
sweet
morsel
but
ultimately
a
and
thus
it
arrests
the
demoralizing
effects
of
this
pernicious
doctrine
of
the
christian
bible
it
may
startle
some
of
the
bible
devotees
to
be
told
that
their
sacred
book
instead
of
being
a
prompter
to
civilization
and
good
morals
is
really
a
hindrance
to
those
ends
and
that
consequently
nations
without
bibles
advance
faster
in
these
respects
than
those
who
are
well
supplied
with
this
book
but
the
facts
of
history
seem
to
establish
this
as
a
fact
as
a
proof
we
will
contrast
the
present
condition
of
heathen
japan
with
that
of
christian
abyssinia
colonel
hall
and
oliphant
both
testify
that
no
drunkenness
no
fighting
no
quarreling
no
thefts
no
robberies
no
rapes
no
fornication
no
domestic
feuds
or
broils
and
no
fraudulent
dealing
take
place
in
japan
no
locks
or
keys
are
used
for
none
are
needed
there
is
no
disposition
to
steal
or
even
to
cheat
or
overreach
in
dealing
but
in
christian
abyssinia
on
the
other
hand
according
to
goodrich
where
bibles
and
churches
are
numerous
and
preaching
and
praying
are
heard
every
day
nearly
all
the
crimes
above
enumerated
are
daily
committed
the
people
go
naked
eat
raw
flesh
cheat
lie
and
murder
and
practice
polygamy
such
a
thing
as
a
legitimate
child
he
tells
us
is
not
known
and
thus
it
has
been
for
fifteen
hundred
years
while
in
the
daily
practice
of
reading
their
bible
the
arts
and
sciences
have
never
been
introduced
amongst
them
and
this
fact
explains
the
cause
of
their
continued
moral
degradation
according
to
noah
webster
the
cultivation
of
the
arts
and
sciences
is
essential
to
the
progress
of
civilization
and
good
morals
but
bible
religion
knows
nothing
about
the
arts
and
sciences
it
do
even
use
the
words
paul
uses
the
word
science
only
once
and
then
to
condemn
it
but
jesus
omits
any
allusion
to
science
philosophy
or
natural
law
so
thoroughly
convinced
were
the
early
disciples
of
the
christian
faith
that
the
teachings
of
their
bible
are
inimical
to
the
arts
and
sciences
that
they
destroyed
works
of
art
wherever
they
could
find
them
and
opposed
with
a
deadly
aim
every
new
discovery
in
the
sciences
as
bibles
represent
only
the
morals
and
state
of
society
in
the
age
in
which
they
are
written
and
are
not
allowed
to
be
altered
or
transcended
they
thus
hold
their
disciples
back
in
all
coming
time
and
compel
them
to
teach
and
practice
the
morals
of
that
age
as
found
taught
in
their
bibles
and
thus
bibles
prevent
the
moral
growth
of
the
people
as
effectually
as
the
chinese
wooden
shoes
prevent
the
growth
of
the
feet
for
a
fuller
exposition
of
this
matter
see
the
bible
of
bibles
chap
xiv
notes
note
of
explanation
in
chapter
xxxi
we
have
traced
christianity
to
essenism
this
may
need
a
fuller
explanation
than
we
have
yet
devoted
to
this
point
though
we
have
stated
several
times
we
consider
them
essentially
one
the
essenes
had
their
exoteric
and
their
esoteric
doctrines
the
latter
which
seems
to
have
included
the
incarnation
atonement
trinity
and
all
the
other
budhist
doctrines
as
set
forth
in
chapter
xxxii
and
now
included
in
the
term
christianity
they
never
published
to
the
world
hence
chapter
xxxi
sets
forth
only
their
exoteric
doctrines
but
as
philo
milman
tytler
and
other
eminent
authors
show
they
held
all
the
doctrines
of
budhism
we
assume
they
were
a
budhist
sect
hence
when
we
speak
of
christianity
growing
out
of
budhism
in
chapter
we
mean
budhism
under
the
name
of
essenism
we
believe
christianity
is
from
essenism
and
budhism
both
because
they
are
essentially
one
and
that
christianity
is
merely
a
continuation
of
budhism
as
taught
by
the
essenian
sect
of
budhists
hence
we
have
sometimes
used
the
term
essenism
and
sometimes
the
term
budhism
as
being
the
fountain
head
of
christianity
we
have
stated
christ
may
have
been
an
essene
either
by
birth
or
by
conversion
but
our
conviction
now
is
that
he
was
one
by
birth
and
we
now
think
it
probable
that
that
portion
of
the
jewish
nation
which
became
known
as
essenes
sprang
up
in
the
budhist
school
of
pythagoras
in
alexandria
in
the
second
or
third
century
before
christ
and
thus
became
essenian
budhists
a
sect
of
jewish
budhists
who
called
themselves
essenes
and
consequently
neither
christ
nor
his
disciples
made
any
changes
in
the
essenian
religion
when
they
changed
its
name
to
christianity
except
to
ingraft
a
few
unimportant
tenets
borrowed
from
the
principal
budhist
sect
we
are
now
convinced
that
essenism
was
complete
budhism
that
christ
was
born
of
essene
parents
and
that
no
important
changes
were
made
by
dropping
the
term
essenism
and
adopting
the
term
christianity
in
its
place
note
to
page
it
may
not
be
improper
to
explain
more
fully
the
reason
for
the
opinion
expressed
on
page
that
the
gospel
writer
john
did
not
believe
that
christ
first
came
into
existence
through
human
birth
but
believed
that
he
like
some
of
the
oriental
gods
was
the
word
personified
without
the
process
of
birth
though
he
may
like
the
heathen
orientalists
have
cherished
the
tradition
that
the
second
god
in
the
trinity
as
he
represents
christ
to
be
after
having
sprung
into
existence
as
the
word
was
subsequently
subjected
to
human
birth
either
so
or
else
his
allusion
to
the
mother
of
christ
was
done
in
condescension
to
the
general
belief
among
the
people
that
he
had
a
human
mother
be
that
as
it
may
he
declares
his
word
was
made
flesh
john
i
nearly
the
same
language
used
by
the
orientalists
which
with
them
did
not
imply
human
birth
and
the
declaration
all
things
were
made
by
him
john
i
is
proof
positive
he
believed
in
christ
existence
as
the
creator
before
his
human
birth
much
of
john
language
is
so
strikingly
similar
to
that
employed
by
the
disciples
of
some
of
the
oriental
religions
who
believed
that
a
second
god
emanated
from
the
mouth
of
the
supreme
to
perform
the
act
of
creation
that
we
can
not
resist
the
conviction
that
this
was
john
belief
especially
as
many
of
them
believed
like
him
that
this
creative
word
became
afterward
a
subject
of
human
birth
thus
as
we
conceive
the
proposition
is
established
note
to
page
our
most
reliable
authorities
testify
that
babylon
never
was
destroyed
but
successfully
resisted
for
one
hundred
and
fifty
years
after
isaiah
time
many
of
the
most
powerful
sieges
and
the
mightiest
munitions
of
war
conducted
by
seven
of
the
most
skilful
generals
that
ever
wielded
the
sword
cyrus
darius
alexander
the
great
antigonus
demetrius
poliorcetes
and
antiochus
she
then
gradually
declined
by
the
removal
of
her
inhabitants
to
other
and
newer
cities
thus
falsifying
the
prediction
of
jeremiah
li
her
end
has
come
and
of
isaiah
xiii
her
days
shall
not
be
prolonged
and
that
desolation
shall
come
upon
her
in
a
day
and
her
destruction
shall
be
effected
suddenly
all
of
which
are
falsified
by
the
facts
just
presented
and
even
if
babylon
had
been
destroyed
the
present
existence
of
hillah
built
in
upon
the
same
spot
with
a
population
according
to
wellstead
of
thousand
is
a
signal
overthrow
of
jeremiah
prophecy
that
it
shall
become
a
wilderness
wherein
no
man
dwelleth
li
and
of
isaiah
also
that
it
should
not
be
dwelt
in
from
generation
to
generation
jeremiah
first
predicted
that
her
sea
and
springs
should
dry
up
li
and
then
declared
the
waves
of
the
sea
should
come
upon
her
li
and
finally
that
she
should
sink
to
rise
no
more
li
and
isaiah
prediction
of
ruin
and
destruction
included
with
babylon
the
land
of
the
chaldeans
which
was
then
and
is
yet
a
great
commercial
country
with
an
annual
revenue
at
this
time
according
to
harvey
brydges
of
a
million
pounds
sterling
here
then
is
a
long
series
of
prophecies
falsified
our
authority
for
saying
that
hillah
occupies
the
site
of
ancient
babylon
is
geography
page
which
declares
hillah
is
situated
within
the
precincts
of
babylon
thus
proving
it
is
not
a
wilderness
wherein
no
man
dwelleth
had
we
space
we
should
present
an
extended
view
of
the
prophecies
