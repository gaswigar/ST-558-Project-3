i
the
lost
joy
all
day
where
the
sunlight
played
on
the
life
sat
all
day
the
soft
wind
played
with
her
hair
and
the
young
young
face
looked
out
across
the
water
she
was
waiting
she
was
waiting
but
she
could
not
tell
for
what
all
day
the
waves
ran
up
and
up
on
the
sand
and
ran
back
again
and
the
pink
shells
rolled
life
sat
waiting
all
day
with
the
sunlight
in
her
eyes
she
sat
there
till
grown
weary
she
laid
her
head
upon
her
knee
and
fell
asleep
waiting
still
then
a
keel
grated
on
the
sand
and
then
a
step
was
on
the
shore
life
awoke
and
heard
it
a
hand
was
laid
upon
her
and
a
great
shudder
passed
through
her
she
looked
up
and
saw
over
her
the
strange
wide
eyes
of
love
and
life
now
knew
for
whom
she
had
sat
there
waiting
and
love
drew
life
up
to
him
and
of
that
meeting
was
born
a
thing
rare
and
beautiful
joy
was
it
called
the
sunlight
when
it
shines
upon
the
merry
water
is
not
so
glad
the
rosebuds
when
they
turn
back
their
lips
for
the
sun
s
first
kiss
are
not
so
ruddy
its
tiny
pulses
beat
quick
it
was
so
warm
so
soft
it
never
spoke
but
it
laughed
and
played
in
the
sunshine
and
love
and
life
rejoiced
exceedingly
neither
whispered
it
to
the
other
but
deep
in
its
own
heart
each
said
it
shall
be
ours
for
then
there
came
a
time
was
it
after
weeks
was
it
after
months
love
and
life
do
not
measure
time
when
the
thing
was
not
as
it
had
been
still
it
played
still
it
laughed
still
it
stained
its
mouth
with
purple
berries
but
sometimes
the
little
hands
hung
weary
and
the
little
eyes
looked
out
heavily
across
the
water
and
life
and
love
dared
not
look
into
each
other
s
eyes
dared
not
say
what
ails
our
darling
each
heart
whispered
to
itself
it
is
nothing
it
is
nothing
tomorrow
it
will
laugh
out
but
tomorrow
and
tomorrow
came
they
journeyed
on
and
the
child
played
beside
them
but
heavily
more
heavily
one
day
life
and
love
lay
down
to
sleep
and
when
they
awoke
it
was
gone
only
near
them
on
the
grass
sat
a
little
stranger
with
eyes
very
soft
and
sad
neither
noticed
it
but
they
walked
apart
weeping
bitterly
oh
our
joy
our
lost
joy
shall
we
see
you
no
more
for
ever
the
little
soft
and
stranger
slipped
a
hand
into
one
hand
of
each
and
drew
them
closer
and
life
and
love
walked
on
with
it
between
them
and
when
life
looked
down
in
anguish
she
saw
her
tears
reflected
in
its
soft
eyes
and
when
love
mad
with
pain
cried
out
i
am
weary
i
am
weary
i
can
journey
no
further
the
light
is
all
behind
the
dark
is
all
before
a
little
rosy
finger
pointed
where
the
sunlight
lay
upon
the
always
its
large
eyes
were
sad
and
thoughtful
always
the
little
brave
mouth
was
smiling
quietly
when
on
the
sharp
stones
life
cut
her
feet
he
wiped
the
blood
upon
his
garments
and
kissed
the
wounded
feet
with
his
little
lips
when
in
the
desert
love
lay
down
faint
for
love
itself
grows
faint
he
ran
over
the
hot
sand
with
his
little
naked
feet
and
even
there
in
the
desert
found
water
in
the
holes
in
the
rocks
to
moisten
love
s
lips
with
he
was
no
burden
he
never
weighted
them
he
only
helped
them
forward
on
their
journey
when
they
came
to
the
dark
ravine
where
the
icicles
hang
from
the
rocks
for
love
and
life
must
pass
through
strange
drear
places
there
where
all
is
cold
and
the
snow
lies
thick
he
took
their
freezing
hands
and
held
them
against
his
beating
little
heart
and
warmed
them
and
softly
he
drew
them
on
and
on
and
when
they
came
beyond
into
the
land
of
sunshine
and
flowers
strangely
the
great
eyes
lit
up
and
dimples
broke
out
upon
the
face
brightly
laughing
it
ran
over
the
soft
grass
gathered
honey
from
the
hollow
tree
and
brought
it
them
on
the
palm
of
its
hand
carried
them
water
in
the
leaves
of
the
lily
and
gathered
flowers
and
wreathed
them
round
their
heads
softly
laughing
all
the
while
he
touched
them
as
their
joy
had
touched
them
but
his
fingers
clung
more
tenderly
so
they
wandered
on
through
the
dark
lands
and
the
light
always
with
that
little
brave
smiling
one
between
them
sometimes
they
remembered
that
first
radiant
joy
and
whispered
to
themselves
oh
could
we
but
find
him
also
at
last
they
came
to
where
reflection
sits
that
strange
old
woman
who
has
always
one
elbow
on
her
knee
and
her
chin
in
her
hand
and
who
steals
light
out
of
the
past
to
shed
it
on
the
future
and
life
and
love
cried
out
o
wise
one
tell
us
when
first
we
met
a
lovely
radiant
thing
belonged
to
us
gladness
without
a
tear
sunshine
without
a
shade
oh
how
did
we
sin
that
we
lost
it
where
shall
we
go
that
we
may
find
it
and
she
the
wise
old
woman
answered
to
have
it
back
will
you
give
up
that
which
walks
beside
you
now
and
in
agony
love
and
life
cried
no
give
up
this
said
life
when
the
thorns
have
pierced
me
who
will
suck
the
poison
out
when
my
head
throbs
who
will
lay
his
tiny
hands
upon
it
and
still
the
beating
in
the
cold
and
the
dark
who
will
warm
my
freezing
heart
and
love
cried
out
better
let
me
die
without
joy
i
can
live
without
this
i
can
not
let
me
rather
die
not
lose
it
and
the
wise
old
woman
answered
o
fools
and
blind
what
you
once
had
is
that
which
you
have
now
when
love
and
life
first
meet
a
radiant
thing
is
born
without
a
shade
when
the
roads
begin
to
roughen
when
the
shades
begin
to
darken
when
the
days
are
hard
and
the
nights
cold
and
long
then
it
begins
to
change
love
and
life
will
not
see
it
will
not
know
it
till
one
day
they
start
up
suddenly
crying
o
god
o
god
we
have
lost
it
where
is
it
they
do
not
understand
that
they
could
not
carry
the
laughing
thing
unchanged
into
the
desert
and
the
frost
and
the
snow
they
do
not
know
that
what
walks
beside
them
still
is
the
joy
grown
older
the
grave
sweet
tender
thing
warm
in
the
coldest
snows
brave
in
the
dreariest
deserts
its
name
is
sympathy
it
is
the
perfect
south
africa
ii
the
hunter
in
certain
valleys
there
was
a
hunter
day
by
day
he
went
to
hunt
for
in
the
woods
and
it
chanced
that
once
he
stood
on
the
shores
of
a
large
lake
while
he
stood
waiting
in
the
rushes
for
the
coming
of
the
birds
a
great
shadow
fell
on
him
and
in
the
water
he
saw
a
reflection
he
looked
up
to
the
sky
but
the
thing
was
gone
then
a
burning
desire
came
over
him
to
see
once
again
that
reflection
in
the
water
and
all
day
he
watched
and
waited
but
night
came
and
it
had
not
returned
then
he
went
home
with
his
empty
bag
moody
and
silent
his
comrades
came
questioning
about
him
to
know
the
reason
but
he
answered
them
nothing
he
sat
alone
and
brooded
then
his
friend
came
to
him
and
to
him
he
spoke
i
have
seen
today
he
said
that
which
i
never
saw
before
a
vast
white
bird
with
silver
wings
outstretched
sailing
in
the
everlasting
blue
and
now
it
is
as
though
a
great
fire
burnt
within
my
breast
it
was
but
a
sheen
a
shimmer
a
reflection
in
the
water
but
now
i
desire
nothing
more
on
earth
than
to
hold
his
friend
laughed
it
was
but
a
beam
playing
on
the
water
or
the
shadow
of
your
own
head
tomorrow
you
will
forget
her
he
said
but
tomorrow
and
tomorrow
and
tomorrow
the
hunter
walked
alone
he
sought
in
the
forest
and
in
the
woods
by
the
lakes
and
among
the
rushes
but
he
could
not
find
her
he
shot
no
more
wild
fowl
what
were
they
to
him
what
ails
him
said
his
comrades
he
is
mad
said
one
no
but
he
is
worse
said
another
he
would
see
that
which
none
of
us
have
seen
and
make
himself
a
come
let
us
forswear
his
company
said
all
so
the
hunter
walked
alone
one
night
as
he
wandered
in
the
shade
very
heartsore
and
weeping
an
old
man
stood
before
him
grander
and
taller
than
the
sons
of
men
who
are
you
asked
the
hunter
i
am
wisdom
answered
the
old
man
but
some
men
call
me
knowledge
all
my
life
i
have
grown
in
these
valleys
but
no
man
sees
me
till
he
has
sorrowed
much
the
eyes
must
be
washed
with
tears
that
are
to
behold
me
and
according
as
a
man
has
suffered
i
and
the
hunter
cried
oh
you
who
have
lived
here
so
long
tell
me
what
is
that
great
wild
bird
i
have
seen
sailing
in
the
blue
they
would
have
me
believe
she
is
a
dream
the
shadow
of
my
own
the
old
man
smiled
her
name
is
truth
he
who
has
once
seen
her
never
rests
again
till
death
he
desires
and
the
hunter
cried
oh
tell
me
where
i
may
find
but
the
old
man
said
you
have
not
suffered
enough
and
went
then
the
hunter
took
from
his
breast
the
shuttle
of
imagination
and
wound
on
it
the
thread
of
his
wishes
and
all
night
he
sat
and
wove
a
net
in
the
morning
he
spread
the
golden
net
upon
the
ground
and
into
it
he
threw
a
few
grains
of
credulity
which
his
father
had
left
him
and
which
he
kept
in
his
they
were
like
white
and
when
you
trod
on
them
a
brown
dust
flew
out
then
he
sat
by
to
see
what
would
happen
the
first
that
came
into
the
net
was
a
bird
with
dove
s
eyes
and
he
sang
a
beautiful
song
a
a
a
it
sang
the
second
that
came
was
black
and
mystical
with
dark
lovely
eyes
that
looked
into
the
depths
of
your
soul
and
he
sang
only
this
immortality
and
the
hunter
took
them
both
in
his
arms
for
he
said
they
are
surely
of
the
beautiful
family
of
then
came
another
green
and
gold
who
sang
in
a
shrill
voice
like
one
crying
in
the
marketplace
reward
after
death
reward
after
death
and
he
said
you
are
not
so
fair
but
you
are
fair
too
and
he
took
it
and
others
came
brightly
coloured
singing
pleasant
songs
till
all
the
grains
were
finished
and
the
hunter
gathered
all
his
birds
together
and
built
a
strong
iron
cage
called
a
new
creed
and
put
all
his
birds
in
it
then
the
people
came
about
dancing
and
singing
oh
happy
hunter
they
cried
oh
wonderful
man
oh
delightful
birds
oh
lovely
songs
no
one
asked
where
the
birds
had
come
from
nor
how
they
had
been
caught
but
they
danced
and
sang
before
them
and
the
hunter
too
was
glad
for
he
said
surely
truth
is
among
them
in
time
she
will
moult
her
feathers
and
i
shall
see
her
but
the
time
passed
and
the
people
sang
and
danced
but
the
hunter
s
heart
grew
heavy
he
crept
alone
as
of
old
to
weep
the
terrible
desire
had
awakened
again
in
his
breast
one
day
as
he
sat
alone
weeping
it
chanced
that
wisdom
met
him
he
told
the
old
man
what
he
had
done
and
wisdom
smiled
sadly
many
men
he
said
have
spread
that
net
for
truth
but
they
have
never
found
her
on
the
grains
of
credulity
she
will
not
feed
in
the
net
of
wishes
her
feet
can
not
be
held
in
the
air
of
these
valleys
she
will
not
breathe
the
birds
you
have
caught
are
of
the
brood
of
lies
lovely
and
beautiful
but
still
lies
truth
knows
them
and
the
hunter
cried
out
in
bitterness
and
must
i
then
sit
still
to
be
devoured
of
this
great
burning
and
the
old
man
said
listen
and
in
that
you
have
suffered
much
and
wept
much
i
will
tell
you
what
i
know
he
who
sets
out
to
search
for
truth
must
leave
these
valleys
of
superstition
forever
taking
with
him
not
one
shred
that
has
belonged
to
them
alone
he
must
wander
down
into
the
land
of
absolute
negation
and
denial
he
must
abide
there
he
must
resist
temptation
when
the
light
breaks
he
must
arise
and
follow
it
into
the
country
of
dry
sunshine
the
mountains
of
stern
reality
will
rise
before
him
he
must
climb
them
beyond
them
lies
and
he
will
hold
her
fast
he
will
hold
her
in
his
hands
the
hunter
cried
wisdom
shook
his
head
he
will
never
see
her
never
hold
her
the
time
is
not
then
there
is
no
hope
cried
the
hunter
there
is
this
said
wisdom
some
men
have
climbed
on
those
mountains
circle
above
circle
of
bare
rock
they
have
scaled
and
wandering
there
in
those
high
regions
some
have
chanced
to
pick
up
on
the
ground
one
white
silver
feather
dropped
from
the
wing
of
truth
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
said
the
old
man
raising
himself
prophetically
and
pointing
with
his
finger
to
the
sky
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
when
enough
of
those
silver
feathers
shall
have
been
gathered
by
the
hands
of
men
and
shall
have
been
woven
into
a
cord
and
the
cord
into
a
net
that
in
that
net
truth
may
be
captured
nothing
but
truth
can
hold
the
hunter
arose
i
will
go
he
said
but
wisdom
detained
him
mark
you
well
who
leaves
these
valleys
never
returns
to
them
though
he
should
weep
tears
of
blood
seven
days
and
nights
upon
the
confines
he
can
never
put
his
foot
across
them
left
they
are
left
forever
upon
the
road
which
you
would
travel
there
is
no
reward
offered
who
goes
goes
freely
for
the
great
love
that
is
in
him
the
work
is
his
i
go
said
the
hunter
but
upon
the
mountains
tell
me
which
path
shall
i
take
i
am
the
child
of
said
the
man
i
can
walk
only
where
many
men
have
trodden
on
these
mountains
few
feet
have
passed
each
man
strikes
out
a
path
for
himself
he
goes
at
his
own
peril
my
voice
he
hears
no
more
i
may
follow
after
him
but
can
not
go
before
then
knowledge
vanished
and
the
hunter
turned
he
went
to
his
cage
and
with
his
hands
broke
down
the
bars
and
the
jagged
iron
tore
his
flesh
it
is
sometimes
easier
to
build
than
to
break
one
by
one
he
took
his
plumed
birds
and
let
them
fly
but
when
he
came
to
his
bird
he
held
it
and
looked
into
its
beautiful
eyes
and
the
bird
uttered
its
low
deep
cry
immortality
and
he
said
quickly
i
can
not
part
with
it
it
is
not
heavy
it
eats
no
food
i
will
hide
it
in
my
breast
i
will
take
it
with
and
he
buried
it
there
and
covered
it
over
with
his
cloak
but
the
thing
he
had
hidden
grew
heavier
heavier
heavier
till
it
lay
on
his
breast
like
lead
he
could
not
move
with
it
he
could
not
leave
those
valleys
with
it
then
again
he
took
it
out
and
looked
at
it
oh
my
beautiful
my
heart
s
own
he
cried
may
i
not
keep
you
he
opened
his
hands
sadly
go
he
said
it
may
happen
that
in
truth
s
song
one
note
is
like
yours
but
i
shall
never
hear
sadly
he
opened
his
hand
and
the
bird
flew
from
him
forever
then
from
the
shuttle
of
imagination
he
took
the
thread
of
his
wishes
and
threw
it
on
the
ground
and
the
empty
shuttle
he
put
into
his
breast
for
the
thread
was
made
in
those
valleys
but
the
shuttle
came
from
an
unknown
country
he
turned
to
go
but
now
the
people
came
about
him
howling
fool
hound
demented
lunatic
they
cried
how
dared
you
break
your
cage
and
let
the
birds
fly
the
hunter
spoke
but
they
would
not
hear
him
truth
who
is
she
can
you
eat
her
can
you
drink
her
who
has
ever
seen
her
your
birds
were
real
all
could
hear
them
sing
oh
fool
vile
reptile
atheist
they
cried
you
pollute
the
come
let
us
take
up
stones
and
stone
him
cried
some
what
affair
is
it
of
ours
said
others
let
the
idiot
go
and
went
away
but
the
rest
gathered
up
stones
and
mud
and
threw
at
him
at
last
when
he
was
bruised
and
cut
the
hunter
crept
away
into
the
woods
and
it
was
evening
about
him
he
wandered
on
and
on
and
the
shade
grew
deeper
he
was
on
the
borders
now
of
the
land
where
it
is
always
night
then
he
stepped
into
it
and
there
was
no
light
there
with
his
hands
he
groped
but
each
branch
as
he
touched
it
broke
off
and
the
earth
was
covered
with
cinders
at
every
step
his
foot
sank
in
and
a
fine
cloud
of
impalpable
ashes
flew
up
into
his
face
and
it
was
dark
so
he
sat
down
upon
a
stone
and
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
to
wait
in
the
land
of
negation
and
denial
till
the
light
came
and
it
was
night
in
his
heart
also
then
from
the
marshes
to
his
right
and
left
cold
mists
arose
and
closed
about
him
a
fine
imperceptible
rain
fell
in
the
dark
and
great
drops
gathered
on
his
hair
and
clothes
his
heart
beat
slowly
and
a
numbness
crept
through
all
his
limbs
then
looking
up
two
merry
wisp
lights
came
dancing
he
lifted
his
head
to
look
at
them
nearer
nearer
they
came
so
warm
so
bright
they
danced
like
stars
of
fire
they
stood
before
him
at
last
from
the
centre
of
the
radiating
flame
in
one
looked
out
a
woman
s
face
laughing
dimpled
with
streaming
yellow
hair
in
the
centre
of
the
other
were
merry
laughing
ripples
like
the
bubbles
on
a
glass
of
wine
they
danced
before
him
who
are
you
asked
the
hunter
who
alone
come
to
me
in
my
solitude
and
darkness
we
are
the
twins
sensuality
they
cried
our
father
s
name
is
and
our
mother
s
name
is
excess
we
are
as
old
as
the
hills
and
rivers
as
old
as
the
first
man
but
we
never
die
they
laughed
oh
let
me
wrap
my
arms
about
you
cried
the
first
they
are
soft
and
warm
your
heart
is
frozen
now
but
i
will
make
it
beat
oh
come
to
me
i
will
pour
my
hot
life
into
you
said
the
second
your
brain
is
numb
and
your
limbs
are
dead
now
but
they
shall
live
with
a
fierce
free
life
oh
let
me
pour
it
in
oh
follow
us
they
cried
and
live
with
us
nobler
hearts
than
yours
have
sat
here
in
this
darkness
to
wait
and
they
have
come
to
us
and
we
to
them
and
they
have
never
left
us
never
all
else
is
a
delusion
but
we
are
real
we
are
real
we
are
real
truth
is
a
shadow
the
valleys
of
superstition
are
a
farce
the
earth
is
of
ashes
the
trees
all
rotten
but
we
feel
us
we
live
you
can
not
doubt
us
feel
us
how
warm
we
are
oh
come
to
us
come
with
us
nearer
and
nearer
round
his
head
they
hovered
and
the
cold
drops
melted
on
his
forehead
the
bright
light
shot
into
his
eyes
dazzling
him
and
the
frozen
blood
began
to
run
and
he
said
yes
why
should
i
die
here
in
this
awful
darkness
they
are
warm
they
melt
my
frozen
blood
and
he
stretched
out
his
hands
to
take
them
then
in
a
moment
there
arose
before
him
the
image
of
the
thing
he
had
loved
and
his
hand
dropped
to
his
side
oh
come
to
us
they
cried
but
he
buried
his
face
you
dazzle
my
eyes
he
cried
you
make
my
heart
warm
but
you
can
not
give
me
what
i
desire
i
will
wait
here
wait
till
i
die
go
he
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
and
would
not
listen
and
when
he
looked
up
again
they
were
two
twinkling
stars
that
vanished
in
the
distance
and
the
long
long
night
rolled
on
all
who
leave
the
valley
of
superstition
pass
through
that
dark
land
but
some
go
through
it
in
a
few
days
some
linger
there
for
months
some
for
years
and
some
die
there
at
last
for
the
hunter
a
faint
light
played
along
the
horizon
and
he
rose
to
follow
it
and
he
reached
that
light
at
last
and
stepped
into
the
broad
sunshine
then
before
him
rose
the
almighty
mountains
of
and
realities
the
clear
sunshine
played
on
them
and
the
tops
were
lost
in
the
clouds
at
the
foot
many
paths
ran
up
an
exultant
cry
burst
from
the
hunter
he
chose
the
straightest
and
began
to
climb
and
the
rocks
and
ridges
resounded
with
his
song
they
had
exaggerated
after
all
it
was
not
so
high
nor
was
the
road
so
steep
a
few
days
a
few
weeks
a
few
months
at
most
and
then
the
top
not
one
feather
only
would
he
pick
up
he
would
gather
all
that
other
men
had
found
weave
the
net
capture
truth
hold
her
fast
touch
her
with
his
hands
clasp
her
he
laughed
in
the
merry
sunshine
and
sang
loud
victory
was
very
near
nevertheless
after
a
while
the
path
grew
steeper
he
needed
all
his
breath
for
climbing
and
the
singing
died
away
on
the
right
and
left
rose
huge
rocks
devoid
of
lichen
or
moss
and
in
the
earth
chasms
yawned
here
and
there
he
saw
a
sheen
of
white
bones
now
too
the
path
began
to
grow
less
and
less
marked
then
it
became
a
mere
trace
with
a
footmark
here
and
there
then
it
ceased
altogether
he
sang
no
more
but
struck
forth
a
path
for
himself
until
it
reached
a
mighty
wall
of
rock
smooth
and
without
break
stretching
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
i
will
rear
a
stair
against
it
and
once
this
wall
climbed
i
shall
be
almost
there
he
said
bravely
and
worked
with
his
shuttle
of
imagination
he
dug
out
stones
but
half
of
them
would
not
fit
and
half
a
month
s
work
would
roll
down
because
those
below
were
ill
chosen
but
the
hunter
worked
on
saying
always
to
himself
once
this
wall
climbed
i
shall
be
almost
there
this
great
work
ended
at
last
he
came
out
upon
the
top
and
he
looked
about
him
far
below
rolled
the
white
mist
over
the
valleys
of
superstition
and
above
him
towered
the
mountains
they
had
seemed
low
before
they
were
of
an
immeasurable
height
now
from
crown
to
foundation
surrounded
by
walls
of
rock
that
rose
tier
above
tier
in
mighty
circles
upon
them
played
the
eternal
sunshine
he
uttered
a
wild
cry
he
bowed
himself
on
to
the
earth
and
when
he
rose
his
face
was
white
in
absolute
silence
he
walked
on
he
was
very
silent
now
in
those
high
regions
the
rarefied
air
is
hard
to
breathe
by
those
born
in
the
valleys
every
breath
he
drew
hurt
him
and
the
blood
oozed
out
from
the
tips
of
his
fingers
before
the
next
wall
of
rock
he
began
to
work
the
height
of
this
seemed
infinite
and
he
said
nothing
the
sound
of
his
tool
rang
night
and
day
upon
the
iron
rocks
into
which
he
cut
steps
years
passed
over
him
yet
he
worked
on
but
the
wall
towered
up
always
above
him
to
heaven
sometimes
he
prayed
that
a
little
moss
or
lichen
might
spring
up
on
those
bare
walls
to
be
a
companion
to
him
but
it
never
came
and
the
years
rolled
on
he
counted
them
by
the
steps
he
had
cut
a
few
for
a
year
only
a
few
he
sang
no
more
he
said
no
more
i
will
do
this
or
that
he
only
worked
and
at
night
when
the
twilight
settled
down
there
looked
out
at
him
from
the
holes
and
crevices
in
the
rocks
strange
wild
faces
stop
your
work
you
lonely
man
and
speak
to
us
they
cried
my
salvation
is
in
work
if
i
should
stop
but
for
one
moment
you
would
creep
down
upon
me
he
replied
and
they
put
out
their
long
necks
further
look
down
into
the
crevice
at
your
feet
they
said
see
what
lie
there
white
bones
as
brave
and
strong
a
man
as
you
climbed
to
these
and
he
looked
up
he
saw
there
was
no
use
in
striving
he
would
never
hold
truth
never
see
her
never
find
her
so
he
lay
down
here
for
he
was
very
tired
he
went
to
sleep
forever
he
put
himself
to
sleep
sleep
is
very
tranquil
you
are
not
lonely
when
you
are
asleep
neither
do
your
hands
ache
nor
your
heart
and
the
hunter
laughed
between
his
teeth
have
i
torn
from
my
heart
all
that
was
dearest
have
i
wandered
alone
in
the
land
of
night
have
i
resisted
temptation
have
i
dwelt
where
the
voice
of
my
kind
is
never
heard
and
laboured
alone
to
lie
down
and
be
food
for
you
ye
harpies
he
laughed
fiercely
and
the
echoes
of
despair
slunk
away
for
the
laugh
of
a
brave
strong
heart
is
as
a
death
blow
to
them
nevertheless
they
crept
out
again
and
looked
at
him
do
you
know
that
your
hair
is
white
they
said
that
your
hands
begin
to
tremble
like
a
child
s
do
you
see
that
the
point
of
your
shuttle
is
gone
it
is
cracked
already
if
you
should
ever
climb
this
stair
they
said
it
will
be
your
last
you
will
never
climb
and
he
answered
i
know
it
and
worked
on
the
old
thin
hands
cut
the
stones
ill
and
jaggedly
for
the
fingers
were
stiff
and
bent
the
beauty
and
the
strength
of
the
man
was
gone
at
last
an
old
wizened
shrunken
face
looked
out
above
the
rocks
it
saw
the
eternal
mountains
rise
with
walls
to
the
white
clouds
but
its
work
was
done
the
old
hunter
folded
his
tired
hands
and
lay
down
by
the
precipice
where
he
had
worked
away
his
life
it
was
the
sleeping
time
at
last
below
him
over
the
valleys
rolled
the
thick
white
mist
once
it
broke
and
through
the
gap
the
dying
eyes
looked
down
on
the
trees
and
fields
of
their
childhood
from
afar
seemed
borne
to
him
the
cry
of
his
own
wild
birds
and
he
heard
the
noise
of
people
singing
as
they
danced
and
he
thought
he
heard
among
them
the
voices
of
his
old
comrades
and
he
saw
far
off
the
sunlight
shine
on
his
early
home
and
great
tears
gathered
in
the
hunter
s
eyes
ah
they
who
die
there
do
not
die
alone
he
cried
then
the
mists
rolled
together
again
and
he
turned
his
eyes
away
i
have
sought
he
said
for
long
years
i
have
laboured
but
i
have
not
found
her
i
have
not
rested
i
have
not
repined
and
i
have
not
seen
her
now
my
strength
is
gone
where
i
lie
down
worn
out
other
men
will
stand
young
and
fresh
by
the
steps
that
i
have
cut
they
will
climb
by
the
stairs
that
i
have
built
they
will
mount
they
will
never
know
the
name
of
the
man
who
made
them
at
the
clumsy
work
they
will
laugh
when
the
stones
roll
they
will
curse
me
but
they
will
mount
and
on
my
work
they
will
climb
and
by
my
stair
they
will
find
her
and
through
me
and
no
man
liveth
to
himself
and
no
man
dieth
to
the
tears
rolled
from
beneath
the
shrivelled
eyelids
if
truth
had
appeared
above
him
in
the
clouds
now
he
could
not
have
seen
her
the
mist
of
death
was
in
his
eyes
my
soul
hears
their
glad
step
coming
he
said
and
they
shall
mount
they
shall
mount
he
raised
his
shrivelled
hand
to
his
eyes
then
slowly
from
the
white
sky
above
through
the
still
air
came
something
falling
falling
falling
softly
it
fluttered
down
and
dropped
on
to
the
breast
of
the
dying
man
he
felt
it
with
his
hands
it
was
a
feather
he
died
holding
it
iii
the
gardens
of
pleasure
she
walked
upon
the
beds
and
the
sweet
rich
scent
arose
and
she
gathered
her
hands
full
of
flowers
then
duty
with
his
white
clear
features
came
and
looked
at
her
then
she
ceased
from
gathering
but
she
walked
away
among
the
flowers
smiling
and
with
her
hands
full
then
duty
with
his
still
white
face
came
again
and
looked
at
her
but
she
she
turned
her
head
away
from
him
at
last
she
saw
his
face
and
she
dropped
the
fairest
of
the
flowers
she
had
held
and
walked
silently
away
then
again
he
came
to
her
and
she
moaned
and
bent
her
head
low
and
turned
to
the
gate
but
as
she
went
out
she
looked
back
at
the
sunlight
on
the
faces
of
the
flowers
and
wept
in
anguish
then
she
went
out
and
it
shut
behind
her
for
ever
but
still
in
her
hand
she
held
of
the
buds
she
had
gathered
and
the
scent
was
very
sweet
in
the
lonely
desert
but
he
followed
her
once
more
he
stood
before
her
with
his
still
white
face
and
she
knew
what
he
had
come
for
she
unbent
the
fingers
and
let
the
flowers
drop
out
the
flowers
she
had
loved
so
and
walked
on
without
them
with
dry
aching
eyes
then
for
the
last
time
he
came
and
she
showed
him
her
empty
hands
the
hands
that
held
nothing
now
but
still
he
looked
then
at
length
she
opened
her
bosom
and
took
out
of
it
one
small
flower
she
had
hidden
there
and
laid
it
on
the
sand
she
had
nothing
more
to
give
now
and
she
wandered
away
and
the
grey
sand
whirled
about
her
iv
in
a
world
there
is
a
world
in
one
of
the
stars
and
things
do
not
happen
here
as
they
happen
there
in
that
world
were
a
man
and
woman
they
had
one
work
and
they
walked
together
side
by
side
on
many
days
and
were
friends
and
that
is
a
thing
that
happens
now
and
then
in
this
world
also
but
there
was
something
in
that
that
there
is
not
here
there
was
a
thick
wood
where
the
trees
grew
closest
and
the
stems
were
interlocked
and
the
summer
sun
never
shone
there
stood
a
shrine
in
the
day
all
was
quiet
but
at
night
when
the
stars
shone
or
the
moon
glinted
on
the
and
all
was
quiet
below
if
one
crept
here
quite
alone
and
knelt
on
the
steps
of
the
stone
altar
and
uncovering
one
s
breast
so
wounded
it
that
the
blood
fell
down
on
the
altar
steps
then
whatever
he
who
knelt
there
wished
for
was
granted
him
and
all
this
happens
as
i
said
because
it
is
a
world
and
things
often
happen
there
as
they
do
not
happen
here
now
the
man
and
woman
walked
together
and
the
woman
wished
well
to
the
man
one
night
when
the
moon
was
shining
so
that
the
leaves
of
all
the
trees
glinted
and
the
waves
of
the
sea
were
silvery
the
woman
walked
alone
to
the
forest
it
was
dark
there
the
moonlight
fell
only
in
little
flecks
on
the
dead
leaves
under
her
feet
and
the
branches
were
knotted
tight
overhead
farther
in
it
got
darker
not
even
a
fleck
of
moonlight
shone
then
she
came
to
the
shrine
she
knelt
down
before
it
and
prayed
there
came
no
answer
then
she
uncovered
her
breast
with
a
sharp
stone
that
lay
there
she
wounded
it
the
drops
dripped
slowly
down
on
to
the
stone
and
a
voice
cried
what
do
you
seek
she
answered
there
is
a
man
i
hold
him
nearer
than
anything
i
would
give
him
the
best
of
all
the
voice
said
what
is
it
the
girl
said
i
know
not
but
that
which
is
most
good
for
him
i
wish
him
to
the
voice
said
your
prayer
is
answered
he
shall
have
then
she
stood
up
she
covered
her
breast
and
held
the
garment
tight
upon
it
with
her
hand
and
ran
out
of
the
forest
and
the
dead
leaves
fluttered
under
her
feet
out
in
the
moonlight
the
soft
air
was
blowing
and
the
sand
glittered
on
the
beach
she
ran
along
the
smooth
shore
then
suddenly
she
stood
still
out
across
the
water
there
was
something
moving
she
shaded
her
eyes
and
looked
it
was
a
boat
it
was
sliding
swiftly
over
the
moonlit
water
out
to
sea
one
stood
upright
in
it
the
face
the
moonlight
did
not
show
but
the
figure
she
knew
it
was
passing
swiftly
it
seemed
as
if
no
one
propelled
it
the
moonlight
s
shimmer
did
not
let
her
see
clearly
and
the
boat
was
far
from
shore
but
it
seemed
almost
as
if
there
was
another
figure
sitting
in
the
stern
faster
and
faster
it
glided
over
the
water
away
away
she
ran
along
the
shore
she
came
no
nearer
it
the
garment
she
had
held
closed
fluttered
open
she
stretched
out
her
arms
and
the
moonlight
shone
on
her
long
loose
hair
then
a
voice
beside
her
whispered
what
is
it
she
cried
with
my
blood
i
bought
the
best
of
all
gifts
for
him
i
have
come
to
bring
it
him
he
is
going
from
me
the
voice
whispered
softly
your
prayer
was
answered
it
has
been
given
she
cried
what
is
it
the
voice
answered
it
is
that
he
might
leave
the
girl
stood
still
far
out
at
sea
the
boat
was
lost
to
sight
beyond
the
moonlight
sheen
the
voice
spoke
softly
art
thou
contented
she
said
i
am
at
her
feet
the
waves
broke
in
long
ripples
softly
on
the
shore
three
dreams
in
a
desert
under
a
as
i
travelled
across
an
african
plain
the
sun
shone
down
hotly
then
i
drew
my
horse
up
under
a
and
i
took
the
saddle
from
him
and
left
him
to
feed
among
the
parched
bushes
and
all
to
right
and
to
left
stretched
the
brown
earth
and
i
sat
down
under
the
tree
because
the
heat
beat
fiercely
and
all
along
the
horizon
the
air
throbbed
and
after
a
while
a
heavy
drowsiness
came
over
me
and
i
laid
my
head
down
against
my
saddle
and
i
fell
asleep
there
and
in
my
sleep
i
had
a
curious
dream
i
thought
i
stood
on
the
border
of
a
great
desert
and
the
sand
blew
about
everywhere
and
i
thought
i
saw
two
great
figures
like
beasts
of
burden
of
the
desert
and
one
lay
upon
the
sand
with
its
neck
stretched
out
and
one
stood
by
it
and
i
looked
curiously
at
the
one
that
lay
upon
the
ground
for
it
had
a
great
burden
on
its
back
and
the
sand
was
thick
about
it
so
that
it
seemed
to
have
piled
over
it
for
centuries
and
i
looked
very
curiously
at
it
and
there
stood
one
beside
me
watching
and
i
said
to
him
what
is
this
huge
creature
who
lies
here
on
the
sand
and
he
said
this
is
woman
she
that
bears
men
in
her
and
i
said
why
does
she
lie
here
motionless
with
the
sand
piled
round
her
and
he
answered
listen
i
will
tell
you
ages
and
ages
long
she
has
lain
here
and
the
wind
has
blown
over
her
the
oldest
oldest
oldest
man
living
has
never
seen
her
move
the
oldest
oldest
book
records
that
she
lay
here
then
as
she
lies
here
now
with
the
sand
about
her
but
listen
older
than
the
oldest
book
older
than
the
oldest
recorded
memory
of
man
on
the
rocks
of
language
on
the
clay
of
ancient
customs
now
crumbling
to
decay
are
found
the
marks
of
her
footsteps
side
by
side
with
his
who
stands
beside
her
you
may
trace
them
and
you
know
that
she
who
now
lies
there
once
wandered
free
over
the
rocks
with
and
i
said
why
does
she
lie
there
now
and
he
said
i
take
it
ages
ago
the
found
her
and
when
she
stooped
low
to
give
suck
to
her
young
and
her
back
was
broad
he
put
his
burden
of
subjection
on
to
it
and
tied
it
on
with
the
broad
band
of
inevitable
necessity
then
she
looked
at
the
earth
and
the
sky
and
knew
there
was
no
hope
for
her
and
she
lay
down
on
the
sand
with
the
burden
she
could
not
loosen
ever
since
she
has
lain
here
and
the
ages
have
come
and
the
ages
have
gone
but
the
band
of
inevitable
necessity
has
not
been
and
i
looked
and
saw
in
her
eyes
the
terrible
patience
of
the
centuries
the
ground
was
wet
with
her
tears
and
her
nostrils
blew
up
the
sand
and
i
said
has
she
ever
tried
to
move
and
he
said
sometimes
a
limb
has
quivered
but
she
is
wise
she
knows
she
can
not
rise
with
the
burden
on
and
i
said
why
does
not
he
who
stands
by
her
leave
her
and
go
on
and
he
said
he
can
not
look
and
i
saw
a
broad
band
passing
along
the
ground
from
one
to
the
other
and
it
bound
them
together
he
said
while
she
lies
there
he
must
stand
and
look
across
the
and
i
said
does
he
know
why
he
can
not
move
and
he
said
and
i
heard
a
sound
of
something
cracking
and
i
looked
and
i
saw
the
band
that
bound
the
burden
on
to
her
back
broken
asunder
and
the
burden
rolled
on
to
the
ground
and
i
said
what
is
this
and
he
said
the
is
dead
the
has
killed
him
with
the
knife
he
holds
in
his
hand
and
silently
and
invisibly
he
has
crept
up
to
the
woman
and
with
that
knife
of
mechanical
invention
he
has
cut
the
band
that
bound
the
burden
to
her
back
the
inevitable
necessity
it
broken
she
might
rise
and
i
saw
that
she
still
lay
motionless
on
the
sand
with
her
eyes
open
and
her
neck
stretched
out
and
she
seemed
to
look
for
something
on
the
border
of
the
desert
that
never
came
and
i
wondered
if
she
were
awake
or
asleep
and
as
i
looked
her
body
quivered
and
a
light
came
into
her
eyes
like
when
a
sunbeam
breaks
into
a
dark
room
i
said
what
is
it
he
whispered
hush
the
thought
has
come
to
her
might
i
not
rise
and
i
looked
and
she
raised
her
head
from
the
sand
and
i
saw
the
dent
where
her
neck
had
lain
so
long
and
she
looked
at
the
earth
and
she
looked
at
the
sky
and
she
looked
at
him
who
stood
by
her
but
he
looked
out
across
the
desert
and
i
saw
her
body
quiver
and
she
pressed
her
front
knees
to
the
earth
and
veins
stood
out
and
i
cried
she
is
going
to
rise
but
only
her
sides
heaved
and
she
lay
still
where
she
was
but
her
head
she
held
up
she
did
not
lay
it
down
again
and
he
beside
me
said
she
is
very
weak
see
her
legs
have
been
crushed
under
her
so
and
i
saw
the
creature
struggle
and
the
drops
stood
out
on
her
and
i
said
surely
he
who
stands
beside
her
will
help
her
and
he
beside
me
answered
he
can
not
help
her
she
must
help
herself
let
her
struggle
till
she
is
and
i
cried
at
least
he
will
not
hinder
her
see
he
moves
farther
from
her
and
tightens
the
cord
between
them
and
he
drags
her
and
he
answered
he
does
not
understand
when
she
moves
she
draws
the
band
that
binds
them
and
hurts
him
and
he
moves
farther
from
her
the
day
will
come
when
he
will
understand
and
will
know
what
she
is
doing
let
her
once
stagger
on
to
her
knees
in
that
day
he
will
stand
close
to
her
and
look
into
her
eyes
with
and
she
stretched
her
neck
and
the
drops
fell
from
her
and
the
creature
rose
an
inch
from
the
earth
and
sank
back
and
i
cried
oh
she
is
too
weak
she
can
not
walk
the
long
years
have
taken
all
her
strength
from
her
can
she
never
move
and
he
answered
me
see
the
light
in
her
eyes
and
slowly
the
creature
staggered
on
to
its
knees
and
i
awoke
and
all
to
the
east
and
to
the
west
stretched
the
barren
earth
with
the
dry
bushes
on
it
the
ants
ran
up
and
down
in
the
red
sand
and
the
heat
beat
fiercely
i
looked
up
through
the
thin
branches
of
the
tree
at
the
blue
sky
overhead
i
stretched
myself
and
i
mused
over
the
dream
i
had
had
and
i
fell
asleep
again
with
my
head
on
my
saddle
and
in
the
fierce
heat
i
had
another
dream
i
saw
a
desert
and
i
saw
a
woman
coming
out
of
it
and
she
came
to
the
bank
of
a
dark
river
and
the
bank
was
steep
and
high
the
banks
of
an
african
river
are
sometimes
a
hundred
feet
high
and
consist
of
deep
shifting
sands
through
which
in
the
course
of
ages
the
river
has
worn
its
gigantic
bed
and
on
it
an
old
man
met
her
who
had
a
long
white
beard
and
a
stick
that
curled
was
in
his
hand
and
on
it
was
written
reason
and
he
asked
her
what
she
wanted
and
she
said
i
am
woman
and
i
am
seeking
for
the
land
of
and
he
said
it
is
before
and
she
said
i
see
nothing
before
me
but
a
dark
flowing
river
and
a
bank
steep
and
high
and
cuttings
here
and
there
with
heavy
sand
in
and
he
said
and
beyond
that
she
said
i
see
nothing
but
sometimes
when
i
shade
my
eyes
with
my
hand
i
think
i
see
on
the
further
bank
trees
and
hills
and
the
sun
shining
on
them
he
said
that
is
the
land
of
she
said
how
am
i
to
get
there
he
said
there
is
one
way
and
one
only
down
the
banks
of
labour
through
the
water
of
suffering
there
is
no
she
said
is
there
no
bridge
he
answered
she
said
is
the
water
deep
he
said
she
said
is
the
floor
worn
he
said
it
is
your
foot
may
slip
at
any
time
and
you
may
be
she
said
have
any
crossed
already
he
said
some
have
tried
she
said
is
there
a
track
to
show
where
the
best
fording
is
he
said
it
has
to
be
she
shaded
her
eyes
with
her
hand
and
she
said
i
will
and
he
said
you
must
take
off
the
clothes
you
wore
in
the
desert
they
are
dragged
down
by
them
who
go
into
the
water
so
and
she
threw
from
her
gladly
the
mantle
of
she
wore
for
it
was
worn
full
of
holes
and
she
took
the
girdle
from
her
waist
that
she
had
treasured
so
long
and
the
moths
flew
out
of
it
in
a
cloud
and
he
said
take
the
shoes
of
dependence
off
your
and
she
stood
there
naked
but
for
one
white
garment
that
clung
close
to
her
and
he
said
that
you
may
keep
so
they
wear
clothes
in
the
land
of
freedom
in
the
water
it
buoys
it
always
and
i
saw
on
its
breast
was
written
truth
and
it
was
white
the
sun
had
not
often
shone
on
it
the
other
clothes
had
covered
it
up
and
he
said
take
this
stick
hold
it
fast
in
that
day
when
it
slips
from
your
hand
you
are
lost
put
it
down
before
you
feel
your
way
where
it
can
not
find
a
bottom
do
not
set
your
and
she
said
i
am
ready
let
me
and
he
said
no
but
stay
what
is
that
in
your
breast
she
was
silent
he
said
open
it
and
let
me
and
she
opened
it
and
against
her
breast
was
a
tiny
thing
who
drank
from
it
and
the
yellow
curls
above
his
forehead
pressed
against
it
and
his
knees
were
drawn
up
to
her
and
he
held
her
breast
fast
with
his
hands
and
reason
said
who
is
he
and
what
is
he
doing
here
and
she
said
see
his
little
wings
and
reason
said
put
him
and
she
said
he
is
asleep
and
he
is
drinking
i
will
carry
him
to
the
land
of
freedom
he
has
been
a
child
so
long
so
long
i
have
carried
him
in
the
land
of
freedom
he
will
be
a
man
we
will
walk
together
there
and
his
great
white
wings
will
overshadow
me
he
has
lisped
one
word
only
to
me
in
the
desert
passion
i
have
dreamed
he
might
learn
to
say
friendship
in
that
and
reason
said
put
him
down
and
she
said
i
will
carry
him
so
with
one
arm
and
with
the
other
i
will
fight
the
he
said
lay
him
down
on
the
ground
when
you
are
in
the
water
you
will
forget
to
fight
you
will
think
only
of
him
lay
him
he
said
he
will
not
die
when
he
finds
you
have
left
him
alone
he
will
open
his
wings
and
fly
he
will
be
in
the
land
of
freedom
before
you
those
who
reach
the
land
of
freedom
the
first
hand
they
see
stretching
down
the
bank
to
help
them
shall
be
love
s
he
will
be
a
man
then
not
a
child
in
your
breast
he
can
not
thrive
put
him
down
that
he
may
and
she
took
her
bosom
from
his
mouth
and
he
bit
her
so
that
the
blood
ran
down
on
to
the
ground
and
she
laid
him
down
on
the
earth
and
she
covered
her
wound
and
she
bent
and
stroked
his
wings
and
i
saw
the
hair
on
her
forehead
turned
white
as
snow
and
she
had
changed
from
youth
to
age
and
she
stood
far
off
on
the
bank
of
the
river
and
she
said
for
what
do
i
go
to
this
far
land
which
no
one
has
ever
reached
oh
i
am
alone
i
am
utterly
alone
and
reason
that
old
man
said
to
her
silence
what
do
you
hear
and
she
listened
intently
and
she
said
i
hear
a
sound
of
feet
a
thousand
times
ten
thousand
and
thousands
of
thousands
and
they
beat
this
way
he
said
they
are
the
feet
of
those
that
shall
follow
you
lead
on
make
a
track
to
the
water
s
edge
where
you
stand
now
the
ground
will
be
beaten
flat
by
ten
thousand
times
ten
thousand
and
he
said
have
you
seen
the
locusts
how
they
cross
a
stream
first
one
comes
down
to
the
and
it
is
swept
away
and
then
another
comes
and
then
another
and
then
another
and
at
last
with
their
bodies
piled
up
a
bridge
is
built
and
the
rest
pass
she
said
and
of
those
that
come
first
some
are
swept
away
and
are
heard
of
no
more
their
bodies
do
not
even
build
the
bridge
and
are
swept
away
and
are
heard
of
no
more
and
what
of
that
he
said
and
what
of
that
she
said
they
make
a
track
to
the
water
s
they
make
a
track
to
the
water
s
edge
and
she
said
over
that
bridge
which
shall
be
built
with
our
bodies
who
will
pass
he
said
the
entire
human
and
the
woman
grasped
her
staff
and
i
saw
her
turn
down
that
dark
path
to
the
river
and
i
awoke
and
all
about
me
was
the
yellow
afternoon
light
the
sinking
sun
lit
up
the
fingers
of
the
milk
bushes
and
my
horse
stood
by
me
quietly
feeding
and
i
turned
on
my
side
and
i
watched
the
ants
run
by
thousands
in
the
red
sand
i
thought
i
would
go
on
my
way
now
the
afternoon
was
cooler
then
a
drowsiness
crept
over
me
again
and
i
laid
back
my
head
and
fell
asleep
and
i
dreamed
a
dream
i
dreamed
i
saw
a
land
and
on
the
hills
walked
brave
women
and
brave
men
hand
in
hand
and
they
looked
into
each
other
s
eyes
and
they
were
not
afraid
and
i
saw
the
women
also
hold
each
other
s
hands
and
i
said
to
him
beside
me
what
place
is
this
and
he
said
this
is
and
i
said
where
is
it
and
he
answered
on
and
i
said
when
shall
these
things
be
and
he
answered
in
the
and
i
awoke
and
all
about
me
was
the
sunset
light
and
on
the
low
hills
the
sun
lay
and
a
delicious
coolness
had
crept
over
everything
and
the
ants
were
going
slowly
home
and
i
walked
towards
my
horse
who
stood
quietly
feeding
then
the
sun
passed
down
behind
the
hills
but
i
knew
that
the
next
day
he
would
arise
again
vi
a
dream
of
wild
bees
a
mother
sat
alone
at
an
open
window
through
it
came
the
voices
of
the
children
as
they
played
under
the
and
the
breath
of
the
hot
afternoon
air
in
and
out
of
the
room
flew
the
bees
the
wild
bees
with
their
legs
yellow
with
pollen
going
to
and
from
the
droning
all
the
while
she
sat
on
a
low
chair
before
the
table
and
darned
she
took
her
work
from
the
great
basket
that
stood
before
her
on
the
table
some
lay
on
her
knee
and
half
covered
the
book
that
rested
there
she
watched
the
needle
go
in
and
out
and
the
dreary
hum
of
the
bees
and
the
noise
of
the
children
s
voices
became
a
confused
murmur
in
her
ears
as
she
worked
slowly
and
more
slowly
then
the
bees
the
fellows
who
make
no
honey
flew
closer
and
closer
to
her
head
droning
then
she
grew
more
and
more
drowsy
and
she
laid
her
hand
with
the
stocking
over
it
on
the
edge
of
the
table
and
leaned
her
head
upon
it
and
the
voices
of
the
children
outside
grew
more
and
more
dreamy
came
now
far
now
near
then
she
did
not
hear
them
but
she
felt
under
her
heart
where
the
ninth
child
lay
bent
forward
and
sleeping
there
with
the
bees
flying
about
her
head
she
had
a
weird
she
thought
the
bees
lengthened
and
lengthened
themselves
out
and
became
human
creatures
and
moved
round
and
round
her
then
one
came
to
her
softly
saying
let
me
lay
my
hand
upon
thy
side
where
the
child
sleeps
if
i
shall
touch
him
he
shall
be
as
she
asked
who
are
you
and
he
said
i
am
health
whom
i
touch
will
have
always
the
red
blood
dancing
in
his
veins
he
will
not
know
weariness
nor
pain
life
will
be
a
long
laugh
to
no
said
another
let
me
touch
for
i
am
wealth
if
i
touch
him
material
care
shall
not
feed
on
him
he
shall
live
on
the
blood
and
sinews
of
his
if
he
will
and
what
his
eye
lusts
for
his
hand
will
have
he
shall
not
know
i
and
the
child
lay
still
like
lead
and
another
said
let
me
touch
him
i
am
fame
the
man
i
touch
i
lead
to
a
high
hill
where
all
men
may
see
him
when
he
dies
he
is
not
forgotten
his
name
rings
down
the
centuries
each
echoes
it
on
to
his
fellows
think
not
to
be
forgotten
through
the
ages
and
the
mother
lay
breathing
steadily
but
in
the
they
pressed
closer
to
her
let
me
touch
the
child
said
one
for
i
am
love
if
i
touch
him
he
shall
not
walk
through
life
alone
in
the
greatest
dark
when
he
puts
out
his
hand
he
shall
find
another
hand
by
it
when
the
world
is
against
him
another
shall
say
you
and
and
the
child
trembled
but
another
pressed
close
and
said
let
me
touch
for
i
am
talent
i
can
do
all
things
that
have
been
done
before
i
touch
the
soldier
the
statesman
the
thinker
and
the
politician
who
succeed
and
the
writer
who
is
never
before
his
time
and
never
behind
it
if
i
touch
the
child
he
shall
not
weep
for
about
the
mother
s
head
the
bees
were
flying
touching
her
with
their
long
tapering
limbs
and
in
her
out
of
the
shadow
of
the
room
came
one
with
sallow
face
the
cheeks
drawn
into
hollows
and
a
mouth
smiling
quiveringly
he
stretched
out
his
hand
and
the
mother
drew
back
and
cried
who
are
you
he
answered
nothing
and
she
looked
up
between
his
eyelids
and
she
said
what
can
you
give
the
child
health
and
he
said
the
man
i
touch
there
wakes
up
in
his
blood
a
burning
fever
that
shall
lick
his
blood
as
fire
the
fever
that
i
will
give
him
shall
be
cured
when
his
life
is
you
give
wealth
he
shook
his
head
the
man
whom
i
touch
when
he
bends
to
pick
up
gold
he
sees
suddenly
a
light
over
his
head
in
the
sky
while
he
looks
up
to
see
it
the
gold
slips
from
between
his
fingers
or
sometimes
another
passing
takes
it
from
fame
he
answered
likely
not
for
the
man
i
touch
there
is
a
path
traced
out
in
the
sand
by
a
finger
which
no
man
sees
that
he
must
follow
sometimes
it
leads
almost
to
the
top
and
then
turns
down
suddenly
into
the
valley
he
must
follow
it
though
none
else
sees
the
love
he
said
he
shall
hunger
for
it
but
he
shall
not
find
it
when
he
stretches
out
his
arms
to
it
and
would
lay
his
heart
against
a
thing
he
loves
then
far
off
along
the
horizon
he
shall
see
a
light
play
he
must
go
towards
it
the
thing
he
loves
will
not
journey
with
him
he
must
travel
alone
when
he
presses
somewhat
to
his
burning
heart
crying
mine
mine
my
own
he
shall
hear
a
voice
renounce
renounce
this
is
not
thine
he
shall
succeed
he
said
he
shall
fail
when
he
runs
with
others
they
shall
reach
the
goal
before
him
for
strange
voices
shall
call
to
him
and
strange
lights
shall
beckon
him
and
he
must
wait
and
listen
and
this
shall
be
the
strangest
far
off
across
the
burning
sands
where
to
other
men
there
is
only
the
desert
s
waste
he
shall
see
a
blue
sea
on
that
sea
the
sun
shines
always
and
the
water
is
blue
as
burning
amethyst
and
the
foam
is
white
on
the
shore
a
great
land
rises
from
it
and
he
shall
see
upon
the
burning
the
mother
said
he
shall
reach
it
and
he
smiled
curiously
she
said
it
is
real
and
he
said
what
is
real
and
she
looked
up
between
his
eyelids
and
said
and
he
leaned
forward
and
laid
his
hand
upon
the
sleeper
and
whispered
to
it
smiling
and
this
only
she
heard
this
shall
be
thy
reward
that
the
ideal
shall
be
real
to
and
the
child
trembled
but
the
mother
slept
on
heavily
and
her
vanished
but
deep
within
her
the
antenatal
thing
that
lay
here
had
a
dream
in
those
eyes
that
had
never
seen
the
day
in
that
brain
was
a
sensation
of
light
light
that
it
never
had
seen
light
that
perhaps
it
never
should
see
light
that
existed
somewhere
and
already
it
had
its
reward
the
ideal
was
real
to
it
london
vii
in
a
ruined
chapel
i
can
not
forgive
i
there
are
four
bare
walls
there
is
a
christ
upon
the
walls
in
red
carrying
his
cross
there
is
a
blessed
bambino
with
the
face
rubbed
out
there
is
madonna
in
blue
and
red
there
are
roman
soldiers
and
a
christ
with
tied
hands
all
the
roof
is
gone
overhead
is
the
blue
blue
italian
sky
the
rain
has
beaten
holes
in
the
walls
and
the
plaster
is
peeling
from
it
the
chapel
stands
here
alone
upon
the
promontory
and
by
day
and
by
night
the
sea
breaks
at
its
feet
some
say
that
it
was
set
here
by
the
monks
from
the
island
down
below
that
they
might
bring
their
sick
here
in
times
of
deadly
plague
some
say
that
it
was
set
here
that
the
passing
monks
and
friars
as
they
hurried
by
upon
the
roadway
might
stop
and
say
their
prayers
here
now
no
one
stops
to
pray
here
and
the
sick
come
no
more
to
be
healed
behind
it
runs
the
old
roman
road
if
you
climb
it
and
come
and
sit
there
alone
on
a
hot
sunny
day
you
may
almost
hear
at
last
the
clink
of
the
roman
soldiers
upon
the
pavement
and
the
sound
of
that
older
time
as
you
sit
there
in
the
sun
when
hannibal
and
his
men
broke
through
the
brushwood
and
no
road
was
now
it
is
very
quiet
sometimes
a
peasant
girl
comes
riding
by
between
her
panniers
and
you
hear
the
mule
s
feet
beat
upon
the
bricks
of
the
pavement
sometimes
an
old
woman
goes
past
with
a
bundle
of
weeds
upon
her
head
or
a
man
hurries
by
with
a
bundle
of
sticks
in
his
hand
but
for
the
rest
the
chapel
lies
here
alone
upon
the
promontory
between
the
two
bays
and
hears
the
sea
break
at
its
feet
i
came
here
one
winter
s
day
when
the
midday
sun
shone
hot
on
the
bricks
of
the
roman
road
i
was
weary
and
the
way
seemed
steep
i
walked
into
the
chapel
to
the
broken
window
and
looked
out
across
the
bay
far
off
across
the
blue
blue
water
were
towns
and
villages
hanging
white
and
red
dots
upon
the
and
the
blue
mountains
rose
up
into
the
sky
and
now
stood
out
from
it
and
now
melted
back
again
the
mountains
seemed
calling
to
me
but
i
knew
there
would
never
be
a
bridge
built
from
them
to
me
never
never
never
i
shaded
my
eyes
with
my
hand
and
turned
away
i
could
not
bear
to
look
at
them
i
walked
through
the
ruined
chapel
and
looked
at
the
christ
in
red
carrying
his
cross
and
the
blessed
bambino
and
the
roman
soldiers
and
the
folded
hands
and
the
reed
and
i
went
and
sat
down
in
the
open
porch
upon
a
stone
at
my
feet
was
the
small
bay
with
its
white
row
of
houses
buried
among
the
olive
trees
the
water
broke
in
a
long
thin
white
line
of
foam
along
the
shore
and
i
leaned
my
elbows
on
my
knees
i
was
tired
very
tired
tired
with
a
tiredness
that
seemed
older
than
the
heat
of
the
day
and
the
shining
of
the
sun
on
the
bricks
of
the
roman
road
and
i
lay
my
head
upon
my
knees
i
heard
the
breaking
of
the
water
on
the
rocks
three
hundred
feet
below
and
the
rustling
of
the
wind
among
the
olive
trees
and
the
ruined
arches
and
then
i
fell
asleep
there
i
had
a
dream
a
man
cried
up
to
god
and
god
sent
down
an
angel
to
help
him
and
the
angel
came
back
and
said
i
can
not
help
that
god
said
how
is
it
with
him
and
the
angel
said
he
cries
out
continually
that
one
has
injured
him
and
he
would
forgive
him
and
he
can
not
god
said
what
have
you
done
for
him
the
angel
said
all
i
took
him
by
the
hand
and
i
said
see
when
other
men
speak
ill
of
that
man
do
you
speak
well
of
him
secretly
in
ways
he
shall
not
know
serve
him
if
you
have
anything
you
value
share
it
with
him
so
serving
him
you
will
at
last
come
to
feel
possession
in
him
and
you
will
and
he
said
i
will
do
afterwards
as
i
passed
by
in
the
dark
of
night
i
heard
one
crying
out
i
have
done
all
it
helps
nothing
my
speaking
well
of
him
helps
me
nothing
if
i
share
my
heart
s
blood
with
him
is
the
burning
within
me
less
i
can
not
forgive
i
can
not
forgive
oh
god
i
can
not
forgive
i
said
to
him
see
here
look
back
on
all
your
past
see
from
your
childhood
all
smallness
all
indirectness
that
has
been
yours
look
well
at
it
and
in
its
light
do
you
not
see
every
man
your
brother
are
you
so
sinless
you
have
right
to
hate
he
looked
and
said
yes
you
are
right
i
too
have
failed
and
i
forgive
my
fellow
go
i
am
satisfied
i
have
forgiven
and
he
laid
him
down
peacefully
and
folded
his
hands
on
his
breast
and
i
thought
it
was
well
with
him
but
scarcely
had
my
wings
rustled
and
i
turned
to
come
up
here
when
i
heard
one
crying
out
on
earth
again
i
can
not
forgive
i
can
not
forgive
oh
god
god
i
can
not
forgive
it
is
better
to
die
than
to
hate
i
can
not
forgive
i
can
not
forgive
and
i
went
and
stood
outside
his
door
in
the
dark
and
i
heard
him
cry
i
have
not
sinned
so
not
so
if
i
have
torn
my
fellows
flesh
ever
so
little
i
have
kneeled
down
and
kissed
the
wound
with
my
mouth
till
it
was
healed
i
have
not
willed
that
any
soul
shall
be
lost
through
hate
of
me
if
they
have
but
fancied
that
i
wronged
them
i
have
lain
down
on
the
ground
before
them
that
they
might
tread
on
me
and
so
seeing
my
humiliation
forgive
and
not
be
lost
through
hating
me
they
have
not
cared
that
my
soul
should
be
lost
they
have
not
willed
to
save
me
they
have
not
tried
that
i
should
forgive
them
i
said
to
him
see
here
be
thou
content
do
not
forgive
forget
this
soul
and
its
injury
go
on
your
way
in
the
next
world
perhaps
he
cried
go
from
me
you
understand
nothing
what
is
the
next
world
to
me
i
am
lost
now
today
i
can
not
see
the
sunlight
shine
the
dust
is
in
my
throat
the
sand
is
in
my
eyes
go
from
me
you
know
nothing
oh
once
again
before
i
die
to
see
that
the
world
is
beautiful
oh
god
god
i
can
not
live
and
not
love
i
can
not
live
and
hate
oh
god
god
god
so
i
left
him
crying
out
and
came
back
god
said
this
man
s
soul
must
be
and
the
angel
said
how
god
said
go
down
you
and
save
the
angel
said
what
more
shall
i
do
then
god
bent
down
and
whispered
in
the
angel
s
ear
and
the
angel
spread
out
its
wings
and
went
down
to
earth
and
partly
i
woke
sitting
there
upon
the
broken
stone
with
my
head
on
my
knee
but
i
was
too
weary
to
rise
i
heard
the
wind
roam
through
the
olive
trees
and
among
the
ruined
arches
and
then
i
slept
again
the
angel
went
down
and
found
the
man
with
the
bitter
heart
and
took
him
by
the
hand
and
led
him
to
a
certain
spot
now
the
man
wist
not
where
it
was
the
angel
would
take
him
nor
what
he
would
show
him
there
and
when
they
came
the
angel
shaded
the
man
s
eyes
with
his
wing
and
when
he
moved
it
the
man
saw
somewhat
on
the
earth
before
them
for
god
had
given
it
to
that
angel
to
unclothe
a
human
soul
to
take
from
it
all
those
outward
attributes
of
form
and
colour
and
age
and
sex
whereby
one
man
is
known
from
among
his
fellows
and
is
marked
off
from
the
rest
and
the
soul
lay
before
them
bare
as
a
man
turning
his
eye
inwards
beholds
himself
they
saw
its
past
its
childhood
the
tiny
life
with
the
dew
upon
it
they
saw
its
youth
when
the
dew
was
melting
and
the
creature
raised
its
lilliputian
mouth
to
drink
from
a
cup
too
large
for
it
and
they
saw
how
the
water
spilt
they
saw
its
hopes
that
were
never
realized
they
saw
its
hours
of
intellectual
blindness
men
call
sin
they
saw
its
hours
of
insight
which
men
call
righteousness
they
saw
its
hour
of
strength
when
it
leaped
to
its
feet
crying
i
am
omnipotent
its
hour
of
weakness
when
it
fell
to
the
earth
and
grasped
dust
only
they
saw
what
it
might
have
been
but
never
would
be
the
man
bent
forward
and
the
angel
said
what
is
it
he
answered
it
is
i
it
is
myself
and
he
went
forward
as
if
he
would
have
lain
his
heart
against
it
but
the
angel
held
him
back
and
covered
his
eyes
now
god
had
given
power
to
the
angel
further
to
unclothe
that
soul
to
take
from
it
all
those
outward
attributes
of
time
and
place
and
circumstance
whereby
the
individual
life
is
marked
off
from
the
life
of
the
whole
again
the
angel
uncovered
the
man
s
eyes
and
he
looked
he
saw
before
him
that
which
in
its
tiny
drop
reflects
the
whole
universe
he
saw
that
which
marks
within
itself
the
step
of
the
furthest
star
and
tells
how
the
crystal
grows
under
ground
where
no
eye
has
seen
it
that
which
is
where
the
germ
in
the
egg
stirs
which
moves
the
outstretched
fingers
of
the
little
newborn
babe
and
keeps
the
leaves
of
the
trees
pointing
upward
which
moves
where
the
sail
alone
on
the
sunny
seas
and
is
where
the
lichens
form
on
the
mountains
rocks
and
the
man
looked
and
the
angel
touched
him
but
the
man
bowed
his
head
and
shuddered
he
whispered
it
is
god
and
the
angel
the
man
s
eyes
and
when
he
uncovered
them
there
was
one
walking
from
them
a
little
way
off
for
the
angel
had
the
soul
in
its
outward
form
and
vesture
and
the
man
knew
who
it
was
and
the
angel
said
do
you
know
him
and
the
man
said
i
know
him
and
he
looked
after
the
figure
and
the
angel
said
have
you
forgiven
him
but
the
man
said
how
beautiful
my
brother
is
and
the
angel
looked
into
the
man
s
eyes
and
he
shaded
his
own
face
with
his
wing
from
the
light
he
laughed
softly
and
went
up
to
god
but
the
men
were
together
on
earth
i
awoke
the
blue
blue
sky
was
over
my
head
and
the
waves
were
breaking
below
on
the
shore
i
walked
through
the
little
chapel
and
i
saw
the
madonna
in
blue
and
red
and
the
christ
carrying
his
cross
and
the
roman
soldiers
with
the
rod
and
the
blessed
bambino
with
its
broken
face
and
then
i
walked
down
the
sloping
rock
to
the
brick
pathway
the
olive
trees
stood
up
on
either
side
of
the
road
their
black
berries
and
leaves
stood
out
against
the
sky
and
the
little
hung
from
the
crevices
in
the
stone
wall
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
it
must
have
rained
while
i
was
asleep
i
thought
i
had
never
seen
the
heavens
and
the
earth
look
so
beautiful
before
i
walked
down
the
road
the
old
old
old
tiredness
was
gone
presently
there
came
a
peasant
boy
down
the
path
leading
his
ass
she
had
two
large
panniers
fastened
to
her
sides
and
they
went
down
the
road
before
me
i
had
never
seen
him
before
but
i
should
have
liked
to
walk
by
him
and
to
have
held
his
hand
only
he
would
not
have
known
why

before

woman
waited
long
and
she
said

ix
the
artist
s
secret
there
was
an
artist
once
and
he
painted
a
picture
other
artists
had
colours
richer
and
rarer
and
painted
more
notable
pictures
he
painted
his
with
one
colour
there
was
a
wonderful
red
glow
on
it
and
the
people
went
up
and
down
saying
we
like
the
picture
we
like
the
the
other
artists
came
and
said
where
does
he
get
his
colour
from
they
asked
him
and
he
smiled
and
said
i
can
not
tell
you
and
worked
on
with
his
head
bent
low
and
one
went
to
the
far
east
and
bought
costly
pigments
and
made
a
rare
colour
and
painted
but
after
a
time
the
picture
faded
another
read
in
the
old
books
and
made
a
colour
rich
and
rare
but
when
he
had
put
it
on
the
picture
it
was
dead
but
the
artist
painted
on
always
the
work
got
redder
and
redder
and
the
artist
grew
whiter
and
whiter
at
last
one
day
they
found
him
dead
before
his
picture
and
they
took
him
up
to
bury
him
the
other
men
looked
about
in
all
the
pots
and
crucibles
but
they
found
nothing
they
had
not
and
when
they
undressed
him
to
put
his
on
him
they
found
above
his
left
breast
the
mark
of
a
wound
it
was
an
old
old
wound
that
must
have
been
there
all
his
life
for
the
edges
were
old
and
hardened
but
death
who
seals
all
things
had
drawn
the
edges
together
and
closed
it
up
and
they
buried
him
and
still
the
people
went
about
saying
where
did
he
find
his
colour
from
and
it
came
to
pass
that
after
a
while
the
artist
was
forgotten
but
the
work
lived
x
i
thought
i
i
thought
i
stood
in
heaven
before
god
s
throne
and
god
asked
me
what
i
had
come
for
i
said
i
had
come
to
arraign
my
brother
man
god
said
what
has
he
done
i
said
he
has
taken
my
sister
woman
and
has
stricken
her
and
wounded
her
and
thrust
her
out
into
the
streets
she
lies
there
prostrate
his
hands
are
red
with
blood
i
am
here
to
arraign
him
that
the
kingdom
be
taken
from
him
because
he
is
not
worthy
and
given
unto
me
my
hands
are
i
showed
them
god
said
thy
hands
are
lift
up
thy
i
raised
it
my
feet
were
red
as
if
i
had
trodden
in
wine
god
said
how
is
this
i
said
dear
lord
the
streets
on
earth
are
full
of
mire
if
i
should
walk
straight
on
in
them
my
outer
robe
might
be
bespotted
you
see
how
white
it
is
therefore
i
pick
my
god
said
on
what
i
was
silent
and
i
let
my
robe
fall
i
wrapped
my
mantle
about
my
head
i
went
out
softly
i
was
afraid
that
the
angels
would
see
me
ii
once
more
i
stood
at
the
gate
of
heaven
i
and
another
we
held
fast
by
one
another
we
were
very
tired
we
looked
up
at
the
great
gates
the
angels
opened
them
and
we
went
in
the
mud
was
on
our
garments
we
walked
across
the
marble
floor
and
up
to
the
great
throne
then
the
angels
divided
us
her
they
set
upon
the
top
step
but
me
upon
the
bottom
for
they
said
last
time
this
woman
came
here
she
left
red
on
the
floor
we
had
to
wash
them
out
with
our
tears
let
her
not
go
then
she
with
whom
i
came
looked
back
and
stretched
out
her
hand
to
me
and
i
went
and
stood
beside
her
and
the
angels
they
the
shining
ones
who
never
sinned
and
never
suffered
walked
by
us
to
and
fro
and
up
and
down
i
think
we
should
have
felt
a
little
lonely
there
if
it
had
not
been
for
one
another
the
angels
were
so
bright
god
asked
me
what
i
had
come
for
and
i
drew
my
sister
forward
a
little
that
he
might
see
her
god
said
how
is
it
you
are
here
together
today
i
said
she
was
upon
the
ground
in
the
street
and
they
passed
over
her
i
lay
down
by
her
and
she
put
her
arms
around
my
neck
and
so
i
lifted
her
and
we
two
rose
god
said
whom
are
you
now
come
to
accuse
before
me
i
said
we
are
come
to
accuse
no
and
god
bent
and
said
my
children
what
is
it
that
ye
seek
and
she
beside
me
drew
my
hand
that
i
should
speak
for
both
i
said
we
have
come
to
ask
that
thou
shouldst
speak
to
man
our
brother
and
give
us
a
message
for
him
that
he
might
understand
and
that
he
might
god
said
go
take
the
message
down
to
him
i
said
but
what
is
the
message
god
said
upon
your
hearts
it
is
written
take
it
down
to
and
we
turned
to
go
the
angels
went
with
us
to
the
door
they
looked
at
us
and
one
said
ai
but
their
dresses
are
beautiful
and
the
other
said
i
thought
it
was
mire
when
they
came
in
but
see
it
is
all
golden
but
another
said
hush
it
is
the
light
from
their
faces
and
we
went
down
to
him
alassio
italy
xi
the
sunlight
lay
across
my
bed
in
the
dark
one
night
i
lay
upon
my
bed
i
heard
the
policeman
s
feet
beat
on
the
pavement
i
heard
the
wheels
of
carriages
roll
home
from
houses
of
entertainment
i
heard
a
woman
s
laugh
below
my
window
and
then
i
fell
asleep
and
in
the
dark
i
dreamt
a
dream
i
dreamt
god
took
my
soul
to
hell
hell
was
a
fair
place
the
water
of
the
lake
was
blue
i
said
to
god
i
like
this
god
said
ay
dost
thou
birds
sang
turf
came
to
the
and
trees
grew
from
it
away
off
among
the
trees
i
saw
beautiful
women
walking
their
clothes
were
of
many
delicate
colours
and
clung
to
them
and
they
were
tall
and
graceful
and
had
yellow
hair
their
robes
trailed
over
the
grass
they
glided
in
and
out
among
the
trees
and
over
their
heads
hung
yellow
fruit
like
large
pears
of
melted
gold
i
said
it
is
very
fair
i
would
go
up
and
taste
the
god
said
and
after
a
while
i
noticed
a
very
fair
woman
pass
she
looked
this
way
and
that
and
drew
down
a
branch
and
it
seemed
she
kissed
the
fruit
upon
it
softly
and
went
on
her
way
and
her
dress
made
no
rustle
as
she
passed
over
the
grass
and
when
i
saw
her
no
more
from
among
the
stems
came
another
woman
fair
as
she
had
been
in
a
delicate
tinted
robe
she
looked
this
way
and
that
when
she
saw
no
one
there
she
drew
down
the
fruit
and
when
she
had
looked
over
it
to
find
a
place
she
put
her
mouth
to
it
softly
and
went
away
and
i
saw
other
and
other
women
come
making
no
noise
and
they
glided
away
also
over
the
grass
and
i
said
to
god
what
are
they
doing
god
said
they
are
and
i
said
how
god
said
they
touch
it
with
their
lips
when
they
have
made
a
tiny
wound
in
it
with
their
they
set
in
it
that
which
is
under
their
tongues
they
close
it
with
their
lip
that
no
man
may
see
the
place
and
pass
i
said
to
god
why
do
they
do
it
god
said
that
another
may
not
i
said
to
god
but
if
they
poison
all
then
none
dare
eat
what
do
they
gain
god
said
i
said
are
they
not
afraid
they
themselves
may
bite
where
another
has
bitten
god
said
they
are
afraid
in
hell
all
men
he
called
me
further
and
the
water
of
the
lake
seemed
less
blue
then
to
the
right
among
the
trees
were
men
working
and
i
said
to
god
i
should
like
to
go
and
work
with
them
hell
must
be
a
very
fruitful
place
the
grass
is
so
god
said
nothing
grows
in
the
garden
they
are
we
stood
looking
and
i
saw
them
working
among
the
bushes
digging
holes
but
in
them
they
set
nothing
and
when
they
had
covered
them
with
sticks
and
earth
each
went
a
way
off
and
sat
behind
the
bushes
watching
and
i
noticed
that
as
each
walked
he
set
his
foot
down
carefully
looking
where
he
trod
i
said
to
god
what
are
they
doing
god
said
making
pitfalls
into
which
their
fellows
may
i
said
to
god
why
do
they
do
it
god
said
because
each
thinks
that
when
his
brother
falls
he
will
i
said
to
god
how
will
he
rise
god
said
he
will
not
and
i
saw
their
eyes
gleam
from
behind
the
bushes
i
said
to
god
are
these
men
sane
god
said
they
are
not
sane
there
is
no
sane
man
in
and
he
told
me
to
come
further
and
i
looked
where
i
trod
and
we
came
where
hell
opened
into
a
plain
and
a
great
house
stood
there
marble
pillars
upheld
the
roof
and
white
marble
steps
let
up
to
it
the
wind
of
heaven
blew
through
it
only
at
the
back
hung
a
thick
curtain
fair
men
and
women
there
feasted
at
long
tables
they
danced
and
i
saw
the
robes
of
women
flutter
in
the
air
and
heard
the
laugh
of
strong
men
what
they
feasted
with
was
wine
they
drew
it
from
large
jars
which
stood
somewhat
in
the
background
and
i
saw
the
wine
sparkle
as
they
drew
it
and
i
said
to
god
i
should
like
to
go
up
and
and
god
said
and
i
saw
men
coming
in
to
the
banquet
house
they
came
in
from
the
back
and
lifted
the
corner
of
the
curtain
at
the
sides
and
crept
in
quickly
and
they
let
the
curtain
fall
behind
them
they
bore
great
jars
they
could
hardly
carry
and
the
men
and
women
crowded
round
them
and
the
opened
their
jars
and
gave
them
of
the
wine
to
drink
and
i
saw
that
the
women
drank
even
more
greedily
than
the
men
and
when
others
had
well
drunken
they
set
the
jars
among
the
old
ones
beside
the
wall
and
took
their
places
at
the
table
and
i
saw
that
some
of
the
jars
were
very
old
and
mildewed
and
dusty
but
others
had
still
drops
of
new
must
on
them
and
shone
from
the
furnace
and
i
said
to
god
what
is
that
for
amid
the
sound
of
the
singing
and
over
the
dancing
of
feet
and
over
the
laughing
across
the
i
heard
a
cry
and
god
said
stand
a
way
and
he
took
me
where
i
saw
both
sides
of
the
curtain
behind
the
house
was
the
where
the
wine
was
made
i
saw
the
grapes
crushed
and
i
heard
them
cry
i
said
do
not
they
on
the
other
side
hear
it
god
said
the
curtain
is
thick
they
are
and
i
said
but
the
men
who
came
in
last
they
saw
god
said
they
let
the
curtain
fall
behind
them
and
they
forget
i
said
how
came
they
by
their
jars
of
wine
god
said
in
the
treading
of
the
press
these
are
they
who
came
to
the
top
they
have
climbed
out
over
the
edge
and
filled
their
jars
from
below
and
have
gone
into
the
and
i
said
and
if
they
had
fallen
as
they
climbed
god
said
they
had
been
i
stood
a
way
off
watching
in
the
sunshine
and
i
shivered
god
lay
in
the
sunshine
watching
too
then
there
rose
one
among
the
feasters
who
said
my
brethren
let
us
pray
and
all
the
men
and
women
rose
and
strong
men
bowed
their
heads
and
mothers
folded
their
little
children
s
hands
together
and
turned
their
faces
upwards
to
the
roof
and
he
who
first
had
risen
stood
at
the
table
head
and
stretched
out
both
his
hands
and
his
beard
was
long
and
white
and
his
sleeves
and
his
beard
had
been
dipped
in
wine
and
because
the
sleeves
were
wide
and
full
they
held
much
wine
and
it
dropped
down
upon
the
floor
and
he
cried
my
brothers
and
my
sisters
let
us
and
all
the
men
and
women
answered
let
us
he
cried
for
this
fair
we
thank
thee
and
all
the
men
and
women
said
we
thank
thee
thine
is
this
house

this
for
us

thou
made
for
oh

our
jars
with

jars

and
plenty
in
our
time
dear

and

our
time
i
said
to
god
whom
is
it
they
are
talking
to
god
said
do
i
know
whom
they
speak
of
and
i
saw
they
were
looking
up
at
the
roof
but
out
in
the
sunshine
god
lay
dear
lord
dear
our
children
s
children
lord
shall
rise
and
call
thee
our
children
s
children
i
said
to
god

grapes

hear
them

call
thee

call
thee
pour
forth
more
wine
upon
us
more
more
more
wine

dear
lord
then
men
and
women
sat
down
and
the
feast
went
on
and
mothers
poured
out
wine
and
fed
their
little
children
with
it
and
men
held
up
the
cup
to
women
s
lips
and
cried
beloved
drink
and
women
filled
their
lovers
flagons
and
held
them
up
and
yet
the
feast
went
on
and
after
a
while
i
looked
and
i
saw
the
curtain
that
hung
behind
the
house
moving
i
said
to
god
is
it
a
wind
god
said
a
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
against
the
curtain
i
saw
pressed
the
forms
of
men
and
women
and
after
a
while
the
feasters
saw
it
move
and
they
whispered
one
to
another
then
some
rose
and
gathered
the
most
cups
and
into
them
they
put
what
was
left
at
the
bottom
of
other
vessels
mothers
whispered
to
their
children
do
not
drink
all
save
a
little
drop
when
you
have
and
when
they
had
collected
all
the
dregs
they
slipped
the
cups
out
under
the
bottom
of
the
curtain
without
lifting
it
after
a
while
the
curtain
left
off
moving
i
said
to
god
how
is
it
so
quiet
he
said
they
have
gone
away
to
drink
i
said
they
drink
it
their
own
god
said
it
comes
from
this
side
of
the
curtain
and
they
are
very
then
the
feast
went
on
and
after
a
while
i
saw
a
small
white
hand
slipped
in
below
the
curtain
s
edge
along
the
floor
and
it
motioned
towards
the
wine
jars
and
i
said
to
god
why
is
that
hand
so
bloodless
and
god
said
it
is
a
and
men
saw
it
and
started
to
their
feet
and
women
cried
and
ran
to
the
great
wine
jars
and
threw
their
arms
around
them
and
cried
ours
our
own
our
beloved
and
twined
their
long
hair
about
them
i
said
to
god
why
are
they
frightened
of
that
one
small
hand
god
answered
because
it
is
so
and
men
ran
in
a
great
company
towards
the
curtain
and
struggled
there
i
heard
them
strike
upon
the
floor
and
when
they
moved
away
the
curtain
hung
smooth
and
still
and
there
was
a
small
stain
upon
the
floor
i
said
to
god
why
do
they
not
wash
it
out
god
said
they
can
not
and
they
took
small
stones
and
put
them
down
along
the
edge
of
the
curtain
to
keep
it
down
then
the
men
and
women
sat
down
again
at
the
tables
and
i
said
to
god
will
those
stones
keep
it
down
god
said
what
think
you
i
said
if
the
wind
blew
god
said
if
the
wind
blew
and
the
feast
went
on
and
suddenly
i
cried
to
god
if
one
should
rise
among
them
even
of
themselves
and
start
up
from
the
table
and
should
cast
away
his
cup
and
cry
my
brothers
and
my
sisters
stay
what
is
it
that
we
drink
and
with
his
sword
should
cut
in
two
the
curtain
and
holding
wide
the
fragments
cry
brothers
sisters
see
it
is
not
wine
not
wine
not
wine
my
brothers
oh
my
sisters
and
he
should
overturn
the
god
said
be
still
see
i
looked
before
the
among
the
grass
i
saw
a
row
of
mounds
flowers
covered
them
and
gilded
marble
stood
at
their
heads
i
asked
god
what
they
were
he
answered
they
are
the
graves
of
those
who
rose
up
at
the
feast
and
and
i
asked
god
how
they
came
there
he
said
the
men
of
the
rose
and
cast
them
down
i
said
who
buried
them
god
said
the
men
who
cast
them
i
said
how
came
it
that
they
threw
them
down
and
then
set
marble
over
them
god
said
because
the
bones
cried
out
they
covered
and
among
the
grass
and
weeds
i
saw
an
unburied
body
lying
and
i
asked
god
why
it
was
god
said
because
it
was
thrown
down
only
yesterday
in
a
little
while
when
the
flesh
shall
have
fallen
from
its
bones
they
will
bury
it
also
and
plant
flowers
over
and
still
the
feast
went
on
men
and
women
sat
at
the
tables
quaffing
great
bowls
some
rose
and
threw
their
arms
about
each
other
and
danced
and
sang
they
pledged
each
other
in
the
wine
and
kissed
each
other
s
lips
higher
and
higher
grew
the
revels
men
when
they
had
drunk
till
they
could
no
longer
threw
what
was
left
in
their
glasses
up
to
the
roof
and
let
it
fall
back
in
cascades
women
dyed
their
children
s
garments
in
the
wine
and
fed
them
on
it
till
their
tiny
mouths
were
red
sometimes
as
the
dancers
whirled
they
overturned
a
vessel
and
their
garments
were
bespattered
children
sat
upon
the
floor
with
great
bowls
of
wine
and
swam
on
it
for
boats
they
put
their
hands
in
the
wine
and
blew
large
red
bubbles
and
higher
and
higher
grew
the
revels
and
wilder
the
dancing
and
louder
and
louder
the
singing
but
here
and
there
among
the
revellers
were
those
who
did
not
revel
i
saw
that
at
the
tables
here
and
there
were
men
who
sat
with
their
elbows
on
the
board
and
hands
shading
their
eyes
they
looked
into
the
beneath
them
and
did
not
drink
and
when
one
touched
them
lightly
on
the
shoulder
bidding
them
to
rise
and
dance
and
sing
they
started
and
then
looked
down
and
sat
there
watching
the
wine
in
the
cup
but
they
did
not
move
and
here
and
there
i
saw
a
woman
sit
apart
the
others
danced
and
sang
and
fed
their
children
but
she
sat
silent
with
her
head
aside
as
though
she
listened
her
little
children
plucked
her
gown
she
did
not
see
them
she
was
listening
to
some
sound
but
she
did
not
stir
the
revels
grew
higher
men
drank
till
they
could
drink
no
longer
and
lay
their
heads
upon
the
table
sleeping
heavily
women
who
could
dance
no
more
leaned
back
on
the
benches
with
their
heads
against
their
lovers
shoulders
little
children
sick
with
wine
lay
down
upon
the
edges
of
their
mothers
robes
sometimes
a
man
rose
suddenly
and
as
he
staggered
struck
the
tables
and
overthrew
the
benches
some
leaned
upon
the
balustrades
sick
unto
death
here
and
there
one
rose
who
staggered
to
the
wine
jars
and
lay
down
beside
them
he
turned
the
wine
tap
but
sleep
overcame
him
as
he
lay
there
and
the
wine
ran
out
slowly
the
thin
red
stream
ran
across
the
white
marbled
floor
it
reached
the
stone
steps
slowly
slowly
slowly
it
trickled
down
from
step
to
step
from
step
to
step
then
it
sank
into
the
earth
a
thin
white
smoke
rose
up
from
it
i
was
silent
i
could
not
breathe
but
god
called
me
to
come
further
and
after
i
had
travelled
for
a
while
i
came
where
on
seven
hills
lay
the
ruins
of
a
mighty
larger
and
stronger
than
the
one
which
i
had
seen
standing
i
said
to
god
what
did
the
men
who
built
it
here
god
said
they
i
said
on
what
god
said
on
and
i
looked
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
behind
the
ruins
lay
still
a
large
circular
hollow
within
the
earth
where
a
foot
of
the
had
stood
i
said
to
god
how
came
it
that
this
large
house
fell
god
said
because
the
earth
was
he
called
me
to
come
further
and
at
last
we
came
upon
a
hill
where
blue
waters
played
and
white
marble
lay
upon
the
earth
i
said
to
god
what
was
here
once
god
said
a
pleasure
i
looked
and
at
my
feet
great
pillars
lay
i
cried
aloud
for
joy
to
god
the
marble
blossoms
god
said
ay
twas
a
fairy
house
there
has
not
been
one
like
to
it
nor
ever
shall
be
the
pillars
and
the
porticoes
blossomed
and
the
wine
cups
were
as
gathered
flowers
on
this
side
all
the
curtain
was
broidered
with
fair
designs
the
stitching
was
of
i
said
to
god
how
came
it
that
it
fell
god
said
on
the
side
of
the
it
was
and
as
we
travelled
we
came
where
lay
a
mighty
ridge
of
sand
and
a
dark
river
ran
there
and
there
rose
two
vast
mounds
i
said
to
god
they
are
very
god
said
ay
exceeding
and
i
listened
god
asked
me
what
i
was
listening
to
and
i
said
a
sound
of
weeping
and
i
hear
the
sound
of
strokes
but
i
can
not
tell
whence
it
god
said
it
is
the
echo
of
the
lingering
still
among
the
upon
the
mounds
a
stood
and
he
called
me
to
come
further
upon
a
barren
where
the
soil
was
arid
god
called
me
to
stand
still
and
i
looked
around
god
said
there
was
a
here
once
upon
a
i
said
to
god
i
see
no
mark
of
any
god
said
there
was
not
left
one
stone
upon
another
that
has
not
been
thrown
and
i
looked
round
and
on
the
was
a
lonely
grave
i
said
to
god
what
lies
there
he
said
a
vine
truss
bruised
in
the
and
at
the
head
of
the
grave
stood
a
cross
and
on
its
foot
lay
a
crown
of
thorns
and
as
i
turned
to
go
i
looked
backward
the
and
the
were
gone
but
the
grave
yet
stood
and
when
i
came
to
the
edge
of
a
long
ridge
there
opened
out
before
me
a
wide
plain
of
sand
and
when
i
looked
downward
i
saw
great
stones
lie
shattered
and
the
desert
sand
had
half
covered
them
over
i
said
to
god
there
is
writing
on
them
but
i
can
not
read
and
god
blew
aside
the
desert
sand
and
i
read
the
writing
weighed
in
the
balance
and
found
but
the
last
word
was
wanting
and
i
said
to
god
it
was
a
god
said
ay
a
i
said
there
was
a
here
god
said
there
was
a
i
asked
no
further
question
i
was
very
weary
i
shaded
my
eyes
with
my
hand
and
looked
through
the
pink
evening
light
far
off
across
the
sand
i
saw
two
figures
standing
with
wings
upfolded
high
above
their
heads
and
stern
faces
set
neither
man
nor
beast
they
looked
out
across
the
desert
sand
watching
watching
watching
i
did
not
ask
god
what
they
were
for
i
knew
what
the
answer
would
be
and
further
and
yet
further
in
the
evening
light
i
looked
with
my
shaded
eyes
far
off
where
the
sands
were
thick
and
heavy
i
saw
a
solitary
pillar
standing
the
crown
had
fallen
and
the
sand
had
buried
it
on
the
broken
pillar
sat
a
grey
with
folded
wings
and
in
the
evening
light
i
saw
the
desert
fox
creep
past
it
trailing
his
brush
across
the
sand
further
yet
further
as
i
looked
across
the
desert
i
saw
the
sand
gathered
into
heaps
as
though
it
covered
something
i
cried
to
god
oh
i
am
so
god
said
you
have
seen
only
one
half
of
i
said
i
can
not
see
more
i
am
afraid
of
hell
in
my
own
narrow
little
path
i
dare
not
walk
because
i
think
that
one
has
dug
a
pitfall
for
me
and
if
i
put
my
hand
to
take
a
fruit
i
draw
it
back
again
because
i
think
it
has
been
kissed
already
if
i
look
out
across
the
plains
the
mounds
are
burial
heaps
and
when
i
pass
among
the
stones
i
hear
them
crying
aloud
when
i
see
men
dancing
i
hear
the
time
beaten
in
with
sobs
and
their
wine
is
living
oh
i
can
not
bear
hell
god
said
where
will
you
go
i
said
to
the
earth
from
which
i
came
it
was
better
and
god
laughed
at
me
and
i
wondered
why
he
laughed
god
said
come
and
i
will
show
you
and
partly
i
awoke
it
was
still
and
dark
the
sound
of
the
carriages
had
died
in
the
street
the
woman
who
laughed
was
gone
and
the
policeman
s
tread
was
heard
no
more
in
the
dark
it
seemed
as
if
a
great
hand
lay
upon
my
heart
and
crushed
it
i
tried
to
breathe
and
tossed
from
side
to
side
and
then
again
i
fell
asleep
and
dreamed
god
took
me
to
the
edge
of
that
world
it
ended
i
looked
down
the
gulf
it
seemed
to
me
was
fathomless
and
then
i
saw
two
bridges
crossing
it
that
both
sloped
upwards
i
said
to
god
is
there
no
other
way
by
which
men
cross
it
god
said
one
it
rises
far
from
here
and
slopes
straight
i
asked
god
what
the
bridges
names
were
god
said
what
matter
for
the
names
call
them
the
good
the
true
the
beautiful
if
you
will
you
will
yet
not
understand
i
asked
god
how
it
was
i
could
not
see
the
third
god
said
it
is
seen
only
by
those
who
climb
i
said
do
they
all
lead
to
one
heaven
god
said
all
heaven
is
one
nevertheless
some
parts
are
higher
than
others
those
who
reach
the
higher
may
always
go
down
to
rest
in
the
lower
but
those
in
the
lower
may
not
have
strength
to
climb
to
the
higher
nevertheless
the
light
is
all
and
i
saw
over
the
bridge
nearest
me
which
was
wider
than
the
other
countless
footmarks
go
i
asked
god
why
so
many
went
over
it
god
said
it
slopes
less
deeply
and
leads
to
the
first
and
i
saw
that
some
of
the
footmarks
were
of
feet
returning
i
asked
god
how
it
was
he
said
no
man
who
has
once
entered
heaven
ever
leaves
it
but
some
when
they
have
gone
half
way
turn
back
because
they
are
afraid
there
is
no
land
i
said
has
none
ever
returned
god
said
no
once
in
heaven
always
in
and
god
took
me
over
and
when
we
came
to
one
of
the
great
doors
for
heaven
has
more
doors
than
one
and
they
are
all
open
the
posts
rose
up
so
high
on
either
side
i
could
not
see
the
top
nor
indeed
if
there
were
any
and
it
seemed
to
me
so
wide
that
all
hell
could
go
in
through
it
i
said
to
god
which
is
the
larger
heaven
or
hell
god
said
hell
is
as
wide
but
heaven
is
deeper
all
hell
could
be
engulfed
in
heaven
but
all
heaven
could
not
be
engulfed
in
and
we
entered
it
was
a
still
great
land
the
mountains
rose
on
every
hand
and
there
was
a
pale
clear
light
and
i
saw
it
came
from
the
rocks
and
stones
i
asked
god
how
it
was
but
god
did
not
answer
me
i
looked
and
wondered
for
i
had
thought
heaven
would
be
otherwise
and
after
a
while
it
began
to
grow
brighter
as
if
the
day
were
breaking
and
i
asked
god
if
the
sun
were
not
going
to
rise
god
said
no
we
are
coming
to
where
the
people
and
as
we
went
on
it
grew
brighter
and
brighter
till
it
was
burning
day
and
on
the
rock
were
flowers
blooming
and
trees
blossomed
at
the
roadside
and
streams
of
water
ran
everywhere
and
i
heard
the
birds
singing
i
asked
god
where
they
were
god
said
it
is
the
people
calling
to
one
and
when
we
came
nearer
i
saw
them
walking
and
they
shone
as
they
walked
i
asked
god
how
it
was
they
wore
no
covering
god
said
because
all
their
body
gives
the
light
they
dare
not
cover
any
and
i
asked
god
what
they
were
doing
god
said
shining
on
the
plants
that
they
may
and
i
saw
that
some
were
working
in
companies
and
some
alone
but
most
were
in
twos
sometimes
two
men
and
sometimes
two
women
but
generally
there
was
one
man
and
one
woman
and
i
asked
god
how
it
was
god
said
when
one
man
and
one
woman
shine
together
it
makes
the
most
perfect
light
many
plants
need
that
for
their
growing
nevertheless
there
are
more
kinds
of
plants
in
heaven
than
one
and
they
need
many
kinds
of
and
one
from
among
the
people
came
running
towards
me
and
when
he
came
near
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
and
i
had
played
together
when
we
were
little
children
and
that
we
had
been
born
on
the
same
day
and
i
told
god
what
i
felt
god
said
all
men
feel
so
in
heaven
when
another
comes
towards
and
he
who
ran
towards
me
held
my
hand
and
led
me
through
the
bright
lights
and
when
we
came
among
the
trees
he
sang
aloud
and
his
companion
answered
and
it
was
a
woman
and
he
showed
me
to
her
she
said
he
must
have
water
and
she
took
some
in
her
hands
and
fed
me
i
had
been
afraid
to
drink
of
the
water
in
hell
and
they
gathered
fruit
for
me
and
gave
it
me
to
eat
they
said
we
shone
long
to
make
it
ripen
and
they
laughed
together
as
they
saw
me
eat
it
the
man
said
he
is
very
weary
he
must
sleep
for
i
had
not
dared
to
sleep
in
hell
and
he
laid
my
head
on
his
companion
s
knee
and
spread
her
hair
out
over
me
i
slept
and
all
the
while
in
my
sleep
i
thought
i
heard
the
birds
calling
across
me
and
when
i
woke
it
was
like
early
morning
with
the
dew
on
everything
and
the
man
took
my
hand
and
led
me
to
a
hidden
spot
among
the
rocks
the
ground
was
very
hard
but
out
of
it
were
sprouting
tiny
plants
and
there
was
a
little
stream
running
he
said
this
is
a
garden
we
are
making
no
one
else
knows
of
it
we
shine
here
every
day
see
the
ground
has
cracked
with
our
shining
and
this
little
stream
is
bursting
out
see
the
flowers
are
and
he
climbed
on
the
rocks
and
picked
from
above
two
little
flowers
with
dew
on
them
and
gave
them
to
me
and
i
took
one
in
each
hand
my
hands
shone
as
i
held
them
he
said
this
garden
is
for
all
when
it
is
and
he
went
away
to
his
companion
and
i
went
out
into
the
great
pathway
and
as
i
walked
in
the
light
i
heard
a
loud
sound
of
much
singing
and
when
i
came
nearer
i
saw
one
with
closed
eyes
singing
and
his
fellows
were
standing
round
him
and
the
light
on
the
closed
eyes
was
brighter
than
anything
i
had
seen
in
heaven
i
asked
one
who
it
was
and
he
said
hush
our
singing
and
i
asked
why
the
eyes
shone
so
and
he
said
they
can
not
see
and
we
have
kissed
them
till
they
shone
and
the
people
gathered
closer
round
him
and
when
i
went
a
little
further
i
saw
a
crowd
crossing
among
the
trees
of
light
with
great
laughter
when
they
came
close
i
saw
they
carried
one
without
hands
or
feet
and
a
light
came
from
the
maimed
limbs
so
bright
that
i
could
not
look
at
them
and
i
said
to
one
what
is
it
he
answered
this
is
our
brother
who
once
fell
and
lost
his
hands
and
feet
and
since
then
he
can
not
help
himself
but
we
have
touched
the
maimed
stumps
so
often
that
now
they
shine
brighter
than
anything
in
heaven
we
pass
him
on
that
he
may
shine
on
things
that
need
much
heat
no
one
is
allowed
to
keep
him
long
he
belongs
to
all
and
they
went
on
among
the
trees
i
said
to
god
this
is
a
strange
land
i
had
thought
blindness
and
maimedness
were
great
evils
here
men
make
them
to
a
god
said
didst
thou
then
think
that
love
had
need
of
eyes
and
hands
and
i
walked
down
the
shining
way
with
palms
on
either
hand
i
said
to
god
ever
since
i
was
a
little
child
and
sat
alone
and
cried
i
have
dreamed
of
this
land
and
now
i
will
not
go
away
again
i
will
stay
here
and
and
i
began
to
take
off
my
garments
that
i
might
shine
as
others
in
that
land
but
when
i
looked
down
i
saw
my
body
gave
no
light
i
said
to
god
how
is
it
god
said
is
there
no
dark
blood
in
your
heart
is
it
bitter
against
none
and
i
said
yes
and
i
thought
now
is
the
time
when
i
will
tell
god
that
which
i
have
been
meaning
to
tell
him
all
along
how
badly
my
have
treated
me
how
they
have
misunderstood
me
how
i
have
intended
to
be
magnanimous
and
generous
to
them
and
they
and
i
began
to
tell
god
but
when
i
looked
down
all
the
flowers
were
withering
under
my
breath
and
i
was
silent
and
god
called
me
to
come
up
higher
and
i
gathered
my
mantle
about
me
and
followed
him
and
the
rocks
grew
higher
and
steeper
on
every
side
and
we
came
at
last
to
a
place
where
a
great
mountain
rose
whose
top
was
lost
in
the
clouds
and
on
its
side
i
saw
men
working
and
they
picked
at
the
earth
with
huge
picks
and
i
saw
that
they
laboured
mightily
and
some
laboured
in
companies
but
most
laboured
singly
and
i
saw
the
drops
of
sweat
fall
from
their
foreheads
and
the
muscles
of
their
arms
stand
out
with
labour
and
i
said
i
had
not
thought
in
heaven
to
see
men
labour
so
and
i
thought
of
the
garden
where
men
sang
and
loved
and
i
wondered
that
any
should
choose
to
labour
on
that
bare
and
i
saw
upon
the
foreheads
of
the
men
as
they
worked
a
light
and
the
drops
which
fell
from
them
as
they
worked
had
light
and
i
asked
god
what
they
were
seeking
for
and
god
touched
my
eyes
and
i
saw
that
what
they
found
were
small
stones
which
had
been
too
bright
for
me
to
see
before
and
i
saw
that
the
light
of
the
stones
and
the
light
on
the
men
s
foreheads
was
the
same
and
i
saw
that
when
one
found
a
stone
he
passed
it
on
to
his
fellow
and
he
to
another
and
he
to
another
no
man
kept
the
stone
he
found
and
at
times
they
gathered
in
great
company
about
when
a
large
stone
was
found
and
raised
a
great
shout
so
that
the
sky
rang
then
they
worked
on
again
and
i
asked
god
what
they
did
with
the
stones
they
found
at
last
then
god
touched
my
eyes
again
to
make
them
stronger
and
i
looked
and
at
my
very
feet
was
a
mighty
crown
the
light
streamed
out
from
it
god
said
each
stone
as
they
find
it
is
set
and
the
crown
was
wrought
according
to
a
marvellous
pattern
one
pattern
ran
through
all
yet
each
part
was
different
i
said
to
god
how
does
each
man
know
where
to
set
his
stone
so
that
the
pattern
is
worked
out
god
said
because
in
the
light
his
forehead
sheds
each
man
sees
faintly
outlined
that
full
and
i
said
but
how
is
it
that
each
stone
is
joined
along
its
edges
to
its
fellows
so
that
there
is
no
seam
anywhere
god
said
the
stones
are
alive
they
and
i
said
but
what
does
each
man
gain
by
his
working
god
said
he
sees
his
outline
i
said
but
those
stones
which
are
last
set
cover
those
which
were
first
and
those
will
again
be
covered
by
those
which
come
god
said
they
are
covered
but
not
hid
the
light
is
the
light
of
all
without
the
first
no
and
i
said
to
god
when
will
this
crown
be
ended
and
god
said
look
up
i
looked
up
and
i
saw
the
mountain
tower
above
me
but
its
summit
i
could
not
see
it
was
lost
in
the
clouds
god
said
no
more
and
i
looked
at
the
crown
then
a
longing
seized
me
like
the
passion
of
a
mother
for
the
child
whom
death
has
taken
like
the
yearning
of
a
friend
for
the
friend
whom
life
has
buried
like
the
hunger
of
dying
eyes
for
a
life
that
is
slipping
like
the
thirst
of
a
soul
for
love
at
its
first
spring
waking
so
but
fiercer
was
the
longing
in
me
i
cried
to
god
i
too
will
work
here
i
too
will
set
stones
in
the
wonderful
pattern
it
shall
grow
beneath
my
hand
and
if
it
be
that
labouring
here
for
years
i
should
not
find
one
stone
at
least
i
will
be
with
the
men
that
labour
here
i
shall
hear
their
shout
of
joy
when
each
stone
is
found
i
shall
join
in
their
triumph
i
shall
shout
among
them
i
shall
see
the
crown
so
great
was
my
longing
as
i
looked
at
the
crown
i
thought
a
faint
light
fell
from
my
forehead
also
god
said
do
you
not
hear
the
singing
in
the
gardens
i
said
no
i
hear
nothing
i
see
only
the
and
i
was
dumb
with
longing
i
forgot
all
the
flowers
of
the
lower
heaven
and
the
singing
there
and
i
ran
forward
and
threw
my
mantle
on
the
earth
and
bent
to
seize
one
of
the
mighty
tools
which
lay
there
i
could
not
lift
it
from
the
earth
god
said
where
hast
thou
earned
the
strength
to
raise
it
take
up
thy
and
i
took
up
my
mantle
and
followed
where
god
called
me
but
i
looked
back
and
i
saw
the
crown
burning
my
crown
that
i
had
loved
higher
and
higher
we
climbed
and
the
air
grew
thinner
not
a
tree
or
plant
was
on
the
bare
rocks
and
the
stillness
was
unbroken
my
breath
came
hard
and
quick
and
the
blood
crept
within
my
i
said
to
god
is
this
heaven
god
said
yes
it
is
the
and
still
we
climbed
i
said
to
god
i
can
not
breathe
so
god
said
because
the
air
is
pure
and
my
head
grew
dizzy
and
as
i
climbed
the
blood
burst
from
my
then
we
came
out
upon
a
lonely
no
living
being
moved
there
but
far
off
on
a
solitary
peak
i
saw
a
lonely
figure
standing
whether
it
were
man
or
woman
i
could
not
tell
for
partly
it
seemed
the
figure
of
a
woman
but
its
limbs
were
the
mighty
limbs
of
a
man
i
asked
god
whether
it
was
man
or
woman
god
said
in
the
least
heaven
sex
reigns
supreme
in
the
higher
it
is
not
noticed
but
in
the
highest
it
does
not
and
i
saw
the
figure
bend
over
its
work
and
labour
mightily
but
what
it
laboured
at
i
could
not
see
i
said
to
god
how
came
it
here
god
said
by
a
bloody
stair
step
by
step
it
mounted
from
the
lowest
hell
and
day
by
day
as
hell
grew
farther
and
heaven
no
nearer
it
hung
alone
between
two
worlds
hour
by
hour
in
that
bitter
struggle
its
limbs
grew
larger
till
there
fell
from
it
rag
by
rag
the
garments
which
it
started
with
drops
fell
from
its
eyes
as
it
strained
them
each
step
it
climbed
was
wet
with
blood
then
it
came
out
and
i
thought
of
the
garden
where
men
sang
with
their
arms
around
one
another
and
the
where
they
worked
in
company
and
i
shuddered
and
i
said
is
it
not
terribly
alone
here
god
said
it
is
never
alone
i
said
what
has
it
for
all
its
labour
i
see
nothing
return
to
then
god
touched
my
eyes
and
i
saw
stretched
out
beneath
us
the
plains
of
heaven
and
hell
and
all
that
was
within
them
god
said
from
that
lone
height
on
which
he
stands
all
things
are
open
to
him
is
clear
the
shining
in
the
garden
he
sees
the
flower
break
forth
and
the
streams
sparkle
no
shout
is
raised
upon
the
but
his
ear
may
hear
it
he
sees
the
crown
grow
and
the
light
shoot
from
it
all
hell
is
open
to
him
he
sees
the
paths
mount
upwards
to
him
hell
is
the
seed
ground
from
which
heaven
springs
he
sees
the
sap
and
i
saw
the
figure
bend
over
its
work
and
the
light
from
its
face
fell
upon
it
and
i
said
to
god
what
is
it
making
and
god
said
music
and
he
touched
my
ears
and
i
heard
it
and
after
a
long
while
i
whispered
to
god
this
is
and
god
asked
me
why
i
was
crying
but
i
could
not
answer
for
joy
and
the
face
turned
from
its
work
and
the
light
fell
upon
me
then
it
grew
so
bright
i
could
not
see
things
separately
and
which
were
god
or
the
man
or
i
i
could
not
tell
we
were
all
blended
i
cried
to
god
where
are
you
but
there
was
no
answer
only
music
and
light
afterwards
when
it
had
grown
so
dark
again
that
i
could
see
things
separately
i
found
that
i
was
standing
there
wrapped
tight
in
my
little
old
brown
earthly
cloak
and
god
and
the
man
were
separated
from
each
other
and
from
me
i
did
not
dare
say
i
would
go
and
make
music
beside
the
man
i
knew
i
could
not
reach
even
to
his
knee
nor
move
the
instrument
he
played
but
i
thought
i
would
stand
there
on
my
little
peak
and
sing
an
accompaniment
to
that
great
music
and
i
tried
but
my
voice
failed
it
piped
and
quavered
i
could
not
sing
that
tune
i
was
silent
then
god
pointed
to
me
that
i
should
go
out
of
heaven
and
i
cried
to
god
oh
let
me
stay
here
if
indeed
it
be
as
i
know
it
is
that
i
am
not
great
enough
to
sing
upon
the
mountain
nor
strong
enough
to
labour
on
its
side
nor
bright
enough
to
shine
and
love
within
the
garden
at
least
let
me
go
down
to
the
great
gateway
humbly
i
will
kneel
there
sweeping
and
as
the
saved
pass
in
i
will
see
the
light
upon
their
faces
i
shall
hear
the
singing
in
the
garden
and
the
shout
upon
the
hillside
god
said
it
may
not
be
he
pointed
and
i
cried
if
i
may
not
stay
in
heaven
then
let
me
go
down
to
hell
and
i
will
grasp
the
hands
of
men
and
women
there
and
slowly
holding
one
another
s
hands
we
will
work
our
way
still
god
pointed
and
i
threw
myself
upon
the
earth
and
cried
earth
is
so
small
so
mean
it
is
not
meet
a
soul
should
see
heaven
and
be
cast
out
again
and
god
laid
his
hand
on
me
and
said
go
back
to
earth
that
which
you
seek
is
i
awoke
it
was
morning
the
silence
and
darkness
of
the
night
were
gone
through
my
narrow
attic
window
i
saw
the
light
of
another
day
i
closed
my
eyes
and
turned
towards
the
wall
i
could
not
look
upon
the
dull
grey
world
in
the
streets
below
men
and
women
streamed
past
by
hundreds
i
heard
the
beat
of
their
feet
on
the
pavement
men
on
their
way
to
business
servants
on
errands
boys
hurrying
to
school
weary
professors
pacing
slowly
the
old
street
prostitutes
men
and
women
dragging
their
feet
wearily
after
last
night
s
debauch
artists
with
quick
impatient
footsteps
tradesmen
for
orders
children
to
seek
for
bread
i
heard
the
stream
beat
by
and
at
the
alley
s
mouth
at
the
street
corner
a
broken
was
playing
sometimes
it
quavered
and
almost
stopped
then
went
on
again
like
a
broken
human
voice
i
listened
my
heart
scarcely
moved
it
was
as
cold
as
lead
i
could
not
bear
the
long
day
before
me
and
i
tried
to
sleep
again
yet
still
i
heard
the
feet
upon
the
pavement
and
suddenly
i
heard
them
cry
loud
as
they
beat
we
are
seeking
we
are
seeking
we
are
seeking
and
the
broken
at
the
street
corner
sobbed
the
beautiful
the
beautiful
the
beautiful
and
my
heart
which
had
been
dead
cried
out
with
every
throb
love
truth
the
beautiful
the
beautiful
it
was
the
music
i
had
heard
in
heaven
that
i
could
not
sing
there
and
fully
i
awoke
upon
the
faded
quilt
across
my
bed
a
long
yellow
streak
of
pale
london
sunlight
was
lying
it
fell
through
my
narrow
attic
window
i
laughed
i
rose
i
was
glad
the
long
day
was
before
me
paris
and
london
