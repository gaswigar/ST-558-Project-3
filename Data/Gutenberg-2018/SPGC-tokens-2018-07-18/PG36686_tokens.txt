the

of
the
mowbray
a
birthday
the
beauties
of
an
english
village
have
been
so
often
dwelt
upon
so
often
described
that
i
dare
not
linger
long
upon
the
sketch
of
wrexhill
which
must
of
necessity
precede
my
introduction
of
its
vicar
and
yet
not
even
england
can
show
many
points
of
greater
beauty
than
this
spot
can
display
its
peculiar
style
of
scenery
half
garden
half
forest
in
aspect
is
familiar
to
all
who
are
acquainted
with
the
new
forest
although
it
has
features
entirely
its
own
one
of
these
is
an
overshot
mill
the
sparkling
fall
of
which
is
accurately
and
most
nobly
overarched
by
a
pair
of
oaks
which
have
long
been
the
glory
of
the
parish
another
is
the
grey
and
mellow
beauty
of
its
antique
church
itself
unencumbered
by
ivy
while
the
wall
and
old
stone
gateway
of
the
churchyard
look
like
a
line
and
knot
of
sober
green
enclosing
it
with
such
a
rich
and
unbroken
luxuriance
of
foliage
never
sear
as
seems
to
show
that
it
is
held
sacred
and
that
no
hand
profane
ever
ventured
to
rob
its
venerable
mass
of
a
leaf
or
a
berry
close
beside
the
church
and
elevated
by
a
very
gentle
ascent
stands
the
pretty
vicarage
as
if
placed
expressly
to
keep
watch
and
ward
over
the
safety
and
repose
of
its
sacred
neighbour
the
only
breach
in
the
fence
of
the
churchyard
is
the
little
wicket
gate
that
opens
from
the
vicarage
garden
but
even
this
is
arched
over
by
the
same
immortal
and
unfading
green
a
fitting
emblem
of
that
eternity
the
hope
of
which
emanates
from
the
shrine
it
encircles
at
this
particular
spot
indeed
the
growth
of
the
plant
is
so
vigorous
that
it
is
controlled
with
difficulty
and
has
not
obeyed
the
hand
which
led
it
over
the
rustic
arch
without
dropping
a
straggling
wreath
or
two
which
if
a
vicar
of
the
nineteenth
century
could
wear
a
wig
might
leave
him
in
the
state
coveted
for
absalom
by
his
father
the
late
vicar
of
wrexhill
however
i
speak
of
him
who
died
a
few
weeks
before
my
story
begins
would
never
permit
these
graceful
pendants
to
be
shorn
declaring
that
the
attitude
they
enforced
on
entering
the
churchyard
was
exactly
such
as
befitted
a
christian
when
passing
the
threshold
of
the
court
of
god
behind
the
vicarage
and
stretching
down
the
side
of
the
little
hill
on
which
it
stood
so
as
to
form
a
beautiful
background
to
the
church
rose
a
grove
of
lofty
that
seemed
to
belong
to
its
garden
but
which
in
fact
was
separated
from
it
by
the
road
which
led
to
mowbray
park
on
the
outskirts
of
which
noble
domain
they
were
situated
this
same
road
having
passed
behind
the
church
and
vicarage
led
to
the
village
street
of
wrexhill
and
thence
towards
various
other
parishes
over
a
common
studded
with
oaks
and
on
one
side
of
which
with
shelving
grassy
banks
that
gave
to
the
scene
the
appearance
of
noble
was
a
sheet
of
water
large
enough
to
be
dignified
by
the
appellation
of
wrexhill
lake
into
this
the
little
stream
that
turned
the
mill
emptied
itself
after
meandering
very
prettily
through
mowbray
park
where
by
the
help
of
a
little
artifice
it
became
wide
enough
at
one
spot
to
deserve
a
boat
and
and
at
another
to
give
occasion
for
the
erection
of
one
of
the
most
graceful
in
the
county
of
hampshire
on
one
side
of
the
common
stands
what
might
be
called
an
alehouse
did
not
the
exquisite
neatness
of
every
feature
belonging
to
the
little
establishment
render
this
vulgar
appellation
inappropriate
it
was
in
truth
just
such
a
place
as
a
and
fastidious
invalid
might
have
fixed
his
eyes
upon
and
said
how
i
should
like
to
lodge
in
that
house
for
a
week
or
two
roses
and
honeysuckles
battled
together
for
space
to
display
themselves
over
the
porch
and
above
the
windows
the
little
enclosure
on
each
side
the
post
whence
swung
the
mowbray
arms
presented
to
the
little
bay
windows
of
the
mansion
such
a
collection
of
odorous
plants
without
a
single
weed
to
rob
them
of
their
strength
that
no
lady
in
the
land
let
her
be
what
it
may
but
would
allow
that
sally
freeman
the
daughter
waiter
gardener
at
the
mowbray
arms
understood
how
to
manage
common
flowers
as
well
as
any
scotchman
in
her
own
scientific
establishment
industry
neatness
and
their
fitting
accompaniment
and
reward

at

they
must
show
themselves
by

it
is
high
time
the
business
of
my
story
should
begin
the
of
may
was
a
gay
day
at
wrexhill
for
it
was
that
on
which
charles
mowbray
came
of
age
and
the
fête
given
on
the
occasion
was
intended
to
include
every
human
being
in
the
parish
besides
about
a
hundred
more
neighbours
and
friends
who
came
from
a
greater
distance
to
witness
and
share
in
the
festivities
a
merrier
or
in
truth
a
happier
set
of
human
beings
than
those
assembled
round
the
at
mowbray
park
on
the
morning
of
that
day
could
hardly
be
found
anywhere
this
important
epoch
in
the
young
heir
life
had
been
long
anticipated
with
gay
impatience
and
seemed
likely
to
be
enjoyed
with
a
fulness
of
contentment
that
should
laugh
to
scorn
the
croaking
prophecy
which
speaks
of
hopes
fulfilled
as
of
something
wherein
doubtful
good
is
ever
blended
with
certain
disappointment
the
mowbray
family
had
hoped
to
wake
upon
a
joyous
morning
and
they
did
so
no
feeling
of
anxiety
no
touch
of
disease
no
shadow
of
unkindness
to
any
being
who
shared
with
them
the
breath
of
life
came
to
blight
the
glee
which
pervaded
the
whole
circle
charles
mowbray
senior
had
hardly
passed
the
prime
of
life
though
a
constitutional
tendency
to
something
like
corpulency
made
him
look
older
than
he
really
was
throughout
his
fifty
summers
he
had
scarcely
known
an
ailment
or
a
grief
and
his
spirit
was
as
fresh
within
him
as
that
of
the
young
man
on
whom
his
eyes
rested
with
equal
pride
and
love
mowbray
just
seven
years
his
junior
looked
as
little
scathed
by
time
as
himself
her
slight
and
graceful
figure
indeed
gave
her
almost
the
appearance
of
youth
and
though
her
delicate
face
had
lost
its
bloom
there
was
enough
of
beauty
left
to
render
her
still
a
very
lovely
woman
charles
mowbray
junior
the
hero
of
the
day
was
in
vulgar
but
expressive
phrase
as
fine
a
young
fellow
as
ever
the
sun
shone
upon
his
mind
too
was
in
excellent
accordance
with
the
frame
it
inhabited
powerful
elastic
unwearying
and
almost
majestic
in
its
unbroken
vigour
and
power
aux
coeurs
heureux
les
vertus
sont
faciles
says
the
proverb
and
as
charles
mowbray
was
certainly
as
happy
as
it
was
well
possible
for
a
man
to
be
he
must
not
be
overpraised
for
the
fine
qualities
that
warmed
his
heart
and
brightened
his
eye
nevertheless
it
is
only
justice
to
declare
that
few
human
beings
ever
passed
through
years
of
life
with
less
of
evil
and
more
of
good
feeling
than
charles
mowbray
helen
his
eldest
sister
was
a
fair
creature
of
nineteen
whose
history
had
hitherto
been
and
was
probably
ever
doomed
to
be
dependant
upon
her
affections
as
yet
these
had
been
wholly
made
up
of
warm
and
attachment
to
her
own
family
but
few
people
capable
of
loving
heartily
are
without
the
capacity
of
suffering
heartily
also
if
occasion
calls
for
it
and
this
strength
of
feeling
rarely
leaves
its
possessor
long
in
the
enjoyment
of
such
pure
and
unmixed
felicity
as
that
which
shone
in
helen
hazel
eye
as
she
threw
her
arms
around
her
brother
neck
and
wished
him
a
thousand
and
a
thousand
times
joy
fanny
mowbray
the
youngest
of
the
family
wanted
three
months
of
sixteen
poets
have
often
likened
young
creatures
of
this
age
to
an
opening
and
it
was
doubtless
just
such
a
being
as
fanny
mowbray
that
first
suggested
the
simile
any
thing
more
bright
more
delicate
more
attractive
in
present
loveliness
or
more
full
of
promise
for
loveliness
more
perfect
still
was
never
seen
in
addition
to
this
surprising
beauty
of
form
and
feature
she
possessed
many
of
those
qualities
of
mind
which
are
attributed
to
genius
meditative
and
imaginative
in
no
common
degree
with
thoughts
occasionally
both
soaring
and
profound
she
passed
many
hours
of
her
existence
in
a
manner
but
little
understood
by
her
family
sometimes
devouring
with
unwearying
ardour
the
miscellaneous
contents
of
the
large
library
and
sometimes
indulging
in
the
new
delight
of
pouring
forth
her
own
wild
rambling
thoughts
in
prose
or
rhyme
unfortunately
the
excellent
governess
who
had
attended
the
two
girls
from
the
time
that
helen
attained
her
eighth
year
died
when
fanny
was
scarcely
fourteen
and
the
attachment
of
the
whole
family
being
manifested
by
a
general
declaration
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
permit
any
one
to
supply
her
place
the
consequence
was
that
the
cadette
of
the
family
had
a
mind
less
well
and
steadily
regulated
than
it
might
have
been
had
her
good
governess
been
spared
to
her
a
few
years
longer
though
so
many
persons
were
expected
before
night
to
share
the
hospitalities
of
mowbray
park
that
notwithstanding
the
ample
size
of
its
mansion
both
the
lady
and
her
housekeeper
were
obliged
to
exert
considerable
skill
in
arranging
their
accommodation
there
was
but
one
person
besides
the
family
present
at
the
happy
and
she
was
not
a
guest
but
an
inmate
rosalind
torrington
was
a
young
irish
girl
from
the
province
of
ulster
who
had
passed
the
first
seventeen
years
of
her
life
in
great
retirement
in
a
village
not
far
distant
from
the
coast
with
no
other
society
than
the
immediate
neighbourhood
afforded
since
that
time
her
destiny
had
undergone
a
great
change
she
was
an
only
child
and
lost
both
father
and
mother
in
one
of
those
pestilential
fevers
which
so
frequently
ravage
the
populous
districts
of
ireland
her
father
was
one
of
that
and
race
of
protestant
clergy
who
during
the
last
few
years
have
suffered
a
degree
of
oppression
and
persecution
unequalled
for
its
barefaced
injustice
by
any
thing
that
the
most
atrocious
page
of
history
can
record
her
mother
of
high
english
descent
had
been
banished
from
all
intercourse
with
her
patrician
family
because
she
refused
to
use
her
influence
with
her
exemplary
husband
to
induce
him
to
abandon
his
profitless
and
often
perilous
preferment
in
ireland
where
he
felt
he
had
the
power
as
well
the
will
to
do
good
in
order
to
place
himself
in
dependence
upon
his
wife
brother
a
bachelor
viscount
who
had
invited
the
impoverished
family
to
his
house
and
promised
some
time
or
other
to
do
something
for
him
in
his
profession
if
he
could
this
invitation
was
politely
but
most
positively
refused
and
for
the
last
three
years
no
intercourse
of
any
kind
had
taken
place
between
them
at
the
end
of
that
time
torrington
and
his
exemplary
wife
while
sedulously
administering
to
the
sick
souls
of
their
poor
parishioners
caught
the
fever
that
raged
among
them
and
perished
torrington
survived
her
husband
three
days
and
during
that
time
her
thoughts
were
painfully
occupied
by
the
future
prospects
of
her
but
girl
all
she
could
do
for
her
she
did
she
wrote
to
her
haughty
brother
in
such
a
manner
as
she
thought
from
her
deathbed
must
produce
some
effect
but
lest
it
should
not
she
addressed
another
letter
to
mowbray
the
favourite
friend
of
her
youth
entreating
her
protection
for
her
orphan
child
this
letter
enclosed
a
will
fully
executed
by
which
she
left
to
her
daughter
whatever
property
she
might
die
possessed
of
amounting
at
the
utmost
as
she
supposed
to
about
five
thousand
pounds
and
constituting
mowbray
sole
guardian
of
her
person
and
property
during
the
interval
which
had
elapsed
since
estrangement
from
her
noble
brother
his
lordship
had
contrived
to
quarrel
also
with
his
nephew
and
heir
and
in
the
height
of
his
resentment
against
him
made
a
will
leaving
the
whole
of
his
unentailed
property
amounting
to
above
eighty
thousand
pounds
to
his
sister
by
a
singular
coincidence
lord
trenet
died
two
days
before
torrington
so
that
her
will
was
made
exactly
one
day
after
she
had
unconsciously
become
the
possessor
of
this
noble
fortune
had
this
most
unexpected
event
been
made
known
to
her
however
it
would
probably
have
made
no
other
alteration
in
her
will
than
the
addition
of
the
name
of
some
male
friend
who
might
have
taken
care
of
the
property
during
the
minority
of
her
child
and
even
this
would
only
have
been
done
for
the
purpose
of
saving
her
friend
trouble
for
such
was
her
opinion
of
mowbray
that
no
circumstances
attending
her
daughter
fortune
could
have
induced
her
to
place
the
precious
deposit
of
her
person
in
other
hands
the
poor
girl
herself
while
these
momentous
events
were
passing
was
stationed
at
the
house
of
an
acquaintance
at
a
few
miles
distance
whither
she
had
been
sent
at
the
first
appearance
of
infection
and
thus
in
the
short
space
of
ten
days
from
the
cherished
happy
darling
of
parents
far
from
rich
she
became
an
heiress
and
an
orphan
rosalind
torrington
was
a
affectionate
girl
who
had
fondly
loved
her
parents
and
she
mourned
for
them
with
all
her
soul
but
the
scene
around
her
was
so
rapidly
and
so
totally
changed
and
so
much
that
was
delightful
mixed
with
the
novelty
that
it
is
not
wonderful
if
at
her
age
her
grief
wore
away
and
left
her
sooner
than
she
could
have
believed
the
change
possible
the
gay
and
happy
inmate
of
mowbray
park
about
four
months
had
elapsed
since
her
arrival
and
she
was
already
greatly
beloved
by
the
whole
family
in
age
she
was
about
between
the
two
sisters
and
as
she
did
not
greatly
resemble
either
of
them
in
temper
or
acquirements
she
was
at
this
time
equally
the
friend
of
both
in
most
branches
of
female
erudition
miss
torrington
was
decidedly
inferior
to
the
miss
mowbrays
but
nature
had
given
her
a
voice
and
a
taste
for
music
which
led
her
to
excel
in
it
and
so
much
spirit
and
vivacity
supplied
on
other
points
the
want
of
regular
study
that
by
the
help
of
her
very
pretty
person
her
good
birth
and
her
large
fortune
nobody
but
charles
mowbray
ever
discovered
deficiency
or
inferiority
of
any
kind
in
rosalind
torrington
but
he
had
declared
vehemently
the
moment
she
arrived
that
she
was
not
one
quarter
so
pretty
as
his
sister
fanny
nor
one
thousandth
part
so
angelic
in
all
ways
as
his
sister
helen
such
was
the
party
who
all
smiles
and
felicitations
first
crowded
clamorously
round
the
hero
of
the
fête
which
now
occupied
the
thoughts
of
all
and
then
seated
themselves
at
the
more
intent
upon
talking
of
its
coming
glories
than
on
doing
justice
to
the
good
things
before
them
oh
you
lucky
exclaimed
miss
torrington
addressing
young
mowbray
did
any
one
ever
see
such
sunshine
and
just
think
what
it
would
have
been
if
all
the
tents
of
the
people
had
been
drenched
with
rain
the
inward
groans
for
best
bonnets
would
have
checked
the
gratulations
in
their
throats
and
we
should
have
had
sighs
perchance
for
cheers
i
do
not
believe
any
single
soul
would
have
cared
for
rain
or
thought
for
one
moment
of
the
weather
let
it
have
been
what
it
would
rosalind
observed
helen
charles
she
continued
is
so
adored
and
doted
upon
by
all
the
people
round
both
rich
and
poor
that
i
am
persuaded
while
they
were
drinking
his
health
there
would
not
have
been
a
thought
bestowed
on
the
weather
oh
to
be
sure
dear
helen
i
quite
forgot
that
of
course
a
glance
at
the
mowbray
would
be
worth
all
the
mackintosh
cloaks
in
the
world
for
keeping
a
dry
skin
in
a
storm
but
then
you
know
the
hero
himself
might
have
caught
cold
when
he
went
out
to
shine
upon
them
and
the
avoiding
this
is
surely
a
blessing
for
which
we
all
ought
to
be
thankful
not
but
what
i
would
have
held
an
umbrella
over
him
with
the
greatest
pleasure
of
course
but
altogether
i
think
it
is
quite
as
well
as
it
is
you
wo
quiz
my
helen
out
of
her
love
for
me
miss
rosalind
torrington
replied
charles
laughing
so
do
not
hope
it
miss
rosalind
torrington
repeated
the
young
lady
indignantly
then
rising
and
approaching
mowbray
she
said
very
solemnly
is
that
my
style
and
title
madam
is
there
any
other
miss
torrington
in
all
the
world
is
there
any
necessity
because
he
is
that
he
should
call
me
miss
rosalind
and
is
it
not
your
duty
oh
my
guardianess
to
support
me
in
all
my
rights
and
privileges
and
you
please
to
scold
him
if
he
calls
me
miss
rosalind
again
beyond
all
question
you
are
miss
torrington
my
dear
replied
mowbray
and
were
not
charles
unfortunately
of
age
and
therefore
legally
beyond
all
control
i
would
certainly
command
him
never
to
say
rosalind
again
that
is
not
exactly
what
i
said
most
respected
replied
the
young
lady
he
may
call
me
rosalind
if
he
will
but
if
i
am
miss
any
thing
i
am
miss
torrington
you
certainly
are
a
lucky
fellow
charles
said
his
father
and
rosalind
is
quite
right
in
praising
the
sunshine
helen
with
her
coaxing
ways
may
say
what
she
will
but
our
fête
would
have
been
spoilt
without
it
indeed
i
think
so
sir
pray
do
not
believe
me
ungrateful
besides
i
like
to
see
everything
accord
and
your
bright
beaming
faces
would
have
been
completely
out
of
keeping
with
a
dark
frowning
sky
yon
are
quite
right
but
come
make
haste
with
your
breakfast
let
us
leave
the
ladies
to
give
an
inquiring
glance
to
the
decorations
of
the
and
let
you
and
i
walk
down
to
the
and
see
how
they
are
getting
on
with
the
tents
and
the
tables
and
all
the
rest
of
it
i
shall
be
ready
in
a
minute
sir
but
i
have
been
scampering
round
the
whole
park
already
this
morning
and
i
am
as
hungry
as
a
hound
give
me
one
more
egg
helen
and
then
it
is
really
a
comfort
to
see
what
a
fine
appetite
he
has
is
it
not
helen
said
rosalind
surrounding
his
plate
with
rolls
of
all
sorts
and
sizes
i
will
call
you
irish
in
the
very
midst
of
the
ball
this
evening
if
you
do
not
behave
better
said
young
mowbray
and
if
you
do
i
will
come
along
charles
said
his
father
her
threats
may
put
you
out
of
heart
for
the
whole
day
and
might
not
we
too
take
a
walk
before
any
of
the
people
arrive
said
fanny
i
have
heard
the
cuckoo
this
morning
for
the
first
time
he
was
certainly
thanking
god
for
the
sunshine
and
i
really
think
we
ought
to
go
out
and
then
we
shall
do
so
too
a
most
delightful
proposal
cried
rosalind
and
if
the
birds
should
happen
to
introduce
a
jig
movement
we
can
practise
our
dancing
steps
as
we
go
along
wait
half
an
hour
for
me
said
charles
rising
to
accompany
his
father
and
i
will
join
your
party
let
us
go
to
the
rosalind
and
you
shall
all
three
drink
my
health
out
of
that
dear
pool
beside
it
that
ros
miss
torrington
admired
so
much
the
other
day
no
no
we
ca
wait
a
moment
char
mowbray
said
rosalind
come
dear
girls
let
us
be
gone
instantly
not
wait
for
him
on
his
birthday
cried
helen
but
you
are
not
in
earnest
rosalind
how
you
do
labour
and
toil
to
spoil
that
man
helen
said
miss
torrington
raising
her
hands
and
eyes
as
he
left
the
room
it
is
a
great
blessing
for
him
that
i
have
come
amongst
you
if
any
thing
can
save
him
from
utter
destruction
it
is
i
shall
do
it
charles
however
was
waited
for
and
that
for
at
least
three
times
the
period
he
had
named
but
he
came
at
last
and
the
walk
was
taken
and
the
birds
sang
and
the
brook
sparkled
and
the
health
was
drunk
cordially
even
by
rosalind
and
the
gay
party
returned
in
time
to
see
the
first
carriage
approach
bearing
guests
invited
to
be
present
at
the
tenants
dinner
in
the
park
their
morning
toilet
was
hastily
readjusted
as
another
and
another
equipage
rolled
onwards
towards
the
house
and
then
the
business
of
the
day
began
lords
and
ladies
knights
and
squires
yeomen
and
peasants
were
seen
riding
driving
running
and
walking
through
the
spacious
park
in
all
directions
then
followed
the
rustic
fête
and
the
joyous
carouse
in
which
the
name
of
charles
mowbray
made
the
welkin
ring
and
then
the
company
having
retreated
to
the
house
came
the
hurried
steps
of
a
dozen
hastening
to
their
various
scenes
of
action
and
valets
converting
closets
of
all
sorts
and
sizes
into
for
unnumbered
gentlemen
and
then
the
banquet
and
then
the
coffee
and
the
short
repose
and
then
the
crowded
ball
all
this
came
and
went
in
order
and
without
the
intervention
of
a
single
circumstance
that
might
mar
the
enjoyment
of
a
day
long
set
apart
for
happiness
and
which
began
and
ended
more
exactly
according
to
the
wishes
and
intentions
of
those
who
arranged
its
festivities
than
often
falls
out
at
galas
planned
by
mortals
at
five
on
the
following
morning
the
joyous
din
at
length
sank
into
silence
and
as
many
as
hospitable
ingenuity
could
find
room
for
lay
down
at
mowbray
park
to
enjoy
again
in
dreams
the
untarnished
gaiety
of
that
happy
day
chapter
ii
the
morning
after
the
birthday
even
the
deemed
themselves
privileged
to
sleep
later
than
usual
on
the
day
after
and
the
ploughboy
as
he
went
afield
missed
the
merry
smile
of
the
park
who
like
her
superiors
seemed
to
think
on
such
an
occasion
time
was
made
for
very
vulgar
souls
indeed
and
that
none
who
had
joined
in
so
illustrious
a
gala
could
be
expected
to
recover
the
full
possession
of
their
waking
senses
for
some
hours
after
the
usual
time
by
slow
degrees
however
the
different
members
of
the
establishment
began
to
stretch
themselves
and
give
sign
of
reviving
animation
the
housemaids
yawningly
opened
the
the
footmen
crept
after
them
to
aid
in
removing
from
one
room
at
least
the
traces
of
the
jubilee
which
like
the
relics
of
a
lamp
that
has
burnt
out
showed
but
the
more
unsightly
from
its
past
splendour
and
at
length
to
a
superficial
eye
the
looked
like
the
of
former
years
though
a
more
discriminating
glance
might
have
detected
girandoles
where
no
such
things
had
ever
glittered
before
in
the
place
of
and
flowers
still
blooming
in
situations
as
little
usual
to
them
as
a
bed
of
strawberries
would
have
been
the
day
before
but
it
was
long
after
these
hireling
efforts
of
forced
labour
had
prepared
the
table
for
the
morning
meal
that
any
one
of
the
favoured
sleepers
destined
to
partake
of
it
left
his
or
her
downy
pillow
in
short
it
was
past
before
the
family
and
their
guests
began
to
assemble
and
even
then
many
stragglers
were
still
waited
for
before
they
appeared
and
mowbray
and
helen
began
at
length
to
talk
of
breaking
up
the
long
session
and
of
giving
orders
to
the
butler
to
take
care
of
all
those
who
should
come
after
it
is
not
very
surprising
that
the
davenports
who
never
ceased
dancing
till
long
after
the
sun
came
to
look
at
them
said
helen
it
is
not
all
wonderful
that
they
should
sleep
late
and
i
believe
vivian
makes
it
a
principle
to
be
the
last
on
all
occasions
but
i
am
quite
astonished
that
papa
does
not
appear
was
he
asleep
mamma
when
you
came
down
this
morning
no
helen
not
quite
asleep
for
he
spoke
to
me
but
i
think
he
was
very
sleepy
for
i
hardly
understood
what
he
said
and
as
he
appeared
extremely
tired
when
he
went
to
bed
i
told
curtis
to
darken
the
room
again
and
leave
him
quiet
another
brought
forth
the
davenports
and
vivian
but
still
mowbray
did
not
appear
and
helen
though
hitherto
she
had
been
quite
satisfied
by
her
mother
account
of
his
prolonged
slumbers
again
began
to
feel
uneasy
about
him
do
you
not
think
mamma
said
she
that
i
might
venture
to
go
up
to
him
i
see
not
the
least
objection
to
it
helen
especially
as
we
know
that
if
it
were
you
who
happened
to
wake
him
out
of
the
soundest
sleep
he
ever
enjoyed
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
near
him
would
quite
atone
for
it
very
well
mamma
then
i
shall
certainly
let
him
sleep
no
longer
now
and
so
saying
helen
left
the
room
is
not
helen
mowbray
a
charming
creature
said
a
gentleman
who
was
seated
next
miss
torrington
and
who
being
neither
young
handsome
rich
nor
noble
felt
that
he
could
wound
no
feelings
by
expressing
his
admiration
of
one
young
lady
to
another
i
will
tell
you
what
she
is
answered
rosalind
warmly
she
is
just
as
much
better
than
every
body
else
in
the
world
as
her
sister
there
is
more
beautiful
and
you
are
said
the
gentleman
fixing
a
pair
of
very
intelligent
eyes
on
her
face
you
are
but
notwithstanding
the
look
of
curiosity
with
which
miss
torrington
listened
the
speaker
suddenly
stopped
for
a
bell
was
rung
with
that
sort
of
sudden
and
continued
vehemence
which
denotes
haste
and
agitation
in
the
hand
that
gives
it
movement
that
is
my
father
bell
said
charles
in
an
accent
of
alarm
and
starting
up
he
was
out
of
the
room
in
an
instant
mowbray
immediately
followed
him
and
for
several
minutes
a
sort
of
heavy
silence
seemed
to
have
fallen
on
every
individual
present
not
a
word
being
uttered
by
any
one
and
the
eyes
of
all
fixing
themselves
on
the
face
of
fanny
who
kept
her
place
as
if
but
with
a
countenance
that
expressed
a
feeling
approaching
to
terror
this
is
not
to
be
borne
exclaimed
rosalind
abruptly
excuse
us
for
a
moment
she
added
addressing
those
who
still
remained
in
the
come
with
me
fanny
and
let
us
know
the
worst
at
once
the
two
girls
left
the
room
together
and
in
a
very
few
minutes
afterwards
a
servant
entered
the
violent
agitation
of
whose
manner
announced
the
news
he
brought
before
he
spoke
it
my
master
my
poor
master
is
dead
were
the
words
he
uttered
and
their
effect
upon
a
party
assembled
for
an
occasion
of
so
much
festivity
and
who
had
so
lately
parted
with
their
kind
and
happy
host
in
perfect
health
may
be
easily
imagined
one
single
word
in
reply
to
the
eager
chorus
of
inquiry
told
the
manner
of
his
death
apoplexy
the
scene
which
followed
was
what
such
an
event
must
necessarily
produce
no
single
creature
present
except
one
pretty
portionless
young
lady
who
thought
it
very
likely
that
charles
might
now
fall
in
love
with
her
could
by
possibility
be
benefited
by
the
death
of
the
amiable
man
who
had
just
breathed
his
last
and
it
is
therefore
probable
that
the
universal
expression
of
regret
was
sincere
in
quality
though
its
quantity
might
have
been
somewhat
preternaturally
increased
by
the
circumstances
in
which
the
parties
were
relatively
placed
when
the
awful
event
was
made
known
several
tears
were
shed
and
some
glasses
of
cold
water
called
for
while
the
carriages
were
getting
ready
the
gentlemen
all
looked
grave
and
many
of
the
ladies
pale
but
in
less
than
half
an
hour
they
had
all
left
the
house
not
one
of
them
as
it
happened
being
on
terms
of
sufficient
intimacy
with
the
family
to
justify
their
offering
to
remain
at
such
a
moment
it
is
easy
enough
to
dismiss
from
the
scene
persons
whose
feelings
were
so
slightly
interested
in
it
but
far
different
would
be
the
task
were
i
to
attempt
painting
the
heartfelt
anguish
of
those
who
remained
mowbray
had
been
so
deeply
yet
so
tranquilly
loved
by
every
member
of
his
family
his
intercourse
with
them
had
been
so
uniformly
that
of
constant
endearment
unchequered
by
any
mixture
of
rough
temper
or
unreasonable
caprice
that
their
love
for
him
was
so
natural
and
inevitable
that
they
had
never
reasoned
upon
it
or
were
fully
aware
of
its
intensity
till
the
dreadful
moment
in
which
they
learned
that
they
had
lost
him
for
ever
the
feelings
of
mowbray
for
many
hours
amounted
to
agony
for
till
a
medical
gentleman
who
examined
the
body
at
length
succeeded
in
convincing
her
that
she
was
mistaken
she
felt
persuaded
that
her
beloved
husband
owed
his
death
to
her
neglect
and
that
if
when
she
mistook
his
unintelligible
speech
for
sleepiness
she
had
discovered
his
condition
and
caused
him
to
be
bled
his
precious
life
might
have
been
saved
it
was
evident
however
from
many
circumstances
that
the
seizure
was
of
a
nature
not
to
be
baffled
or
parried
by
art
and
the
relief
this
conviction
at
length
afforded
the
widow
was
so
great
that
her
having
first
formed
a
contrary
opinion
was
perhaps
a
blessing
to
her
the
grief
of
charles
was
that
of
a
young
ardent
and
most
affectionate
spirit
but
his
mother
and
his
sisters
now
seemed
to
hang
upon
him
wholly
and
the
being
who
alone
can
read
all
hearts
only
knew
how
deep
was
the
sorrow
he
felt
the
young
fanny
stealing
away
to
her
chamber
threw
herself
in
an
agony
of
tears
upon
her
bed
and
forgotten
in
the
general
dismay
that
had
fallen
upon
all
wept
herself
into
a
sleep
that
lasted
till
she
awakened
on
the
following
morning
to
a
renewed
sense
of
sorrow
which
came
over
her
like
the
dreadful
memory
of
some
frightful
dream
but
of
all
those
whom
poor
mowbray
had
left
to
deplore
his
loss
it
was
helen
his
darling
helen
who
unquestionably
felt
it
the
most
profoundly
his
love
for
her
had
all
that
is
most
touching
in
partiality
without
one
atom
of
the
injustice
which
renders
such
a
feeling
criminal
and
its
effect
upon
her
loving
and
enthusiastic
temper
was
stronger
than
any
words
can
describe
miss
torrington
was
perhaps
beyond
any
other
member
of
the
family
aware
of
this
and
the
tenderest
pity
for
the
silent
suffering
helen
took
possession
of
her
she
was
in
truth
a
upon
the
melancholy
scene
and
as
such
was
more
qualified
to
judge
how
sorrow
worked
in
each
of
them
than
any
other
could
be
her
residence
in
the
family
though
sufficient
to
impress
her
with
the
kindest
feelings
towards
its
chief
and
the
deepest
impression
of
his
worth
had
hardly
been
long
enough
to
awaken
thoroughly
her
affections
towards
him
and
she
wept
more
in
pity
for
those
around
her
than
from
any
personal
feeling
of
grief
for
the
loss
she
had
herself
sustained
to
soothe
poor
helen
to
lead
her
thoughts
even
for
a
moment
from
the
subject
that
engrossed
them
and
to
keep
her
as
much
as
possible
from
gazing
in
vain
tenderness
and
hopeless
agony
upon
the
body
of
her
father
became
the
sole
occupation
of
rosalind
during
the
dreadful
interval
between
the
real
loss
of
the
beloved
being
to
whom
the
soul
of
his
child
still
fondly
clung
and
the
apparently
more
final
separation
still
which
took
place
when
all
that
was
left
of
him
was
borne
from
the
house
helen
made
little
apparent
return
to
all
these
tender
cares
but
she
was
fully
conscious
of
them
she
felt
that
rosalind
read
her
heart
and
knew
how
to
pity
her
and
the
conviction
turned
liking
into
love
of
that
enduring
kind
which
such
hearts
as
helen
alone
know
how
to
give
chapter
iii
the
vicar
of
wrexhill
on
the
day
preceding
that
appointed
for
the
funeral
mowbray
received
the
following
letter
madam
i
trust
that
as
the
minister
of
your
parish
my
venturing
to
break
in
upon
your
grief
will
not
be
considered
as
an
intrusion
in
the
festivities
which
have
ended
so
awfully
your
hospitality
invited
me
and
my
children
to
bear
a
part
and
although
i
declined
the
invitation
i
am
most
anxious
to
prove
to
you
madam
and
to
your
family
that
no
deficiency
of
friendly
feeling
induced
me
to
do
so
but
is
better
to
go
to
the
house
of
mourning
than
to
the
house
of
feasting
and
i
now
therefore
ask
your
permission
to
wait
on
you
with
the
most
earnest
hope
that
the
sacred
office
i
hold
may
enable
you
to
receive
me
rather
with
a
feeling
of
comfort
than
of
pain
be
assured
madam
that
short
as
the
period
of
my
ministry
in
the
parish
of
wrexhill
has
been
it
is
with
deep
sympathy
in
the
grief
that
afflicts
you
that
i
subscribe
myself
madam
your
humble
servant
and
friend
william
jacob
cartwright
wrexhill
vicarage
may
little
calculated
as
this
letter
may
seem
to
excite
violent
emotion
it
threw
poor
mowbray
into
an
agony
of
renewed
grief
the
idea
of
seeing
for
the
first
time
since
her
loss
a
person
who
however
in
his
wish
to
visit
her
must
be
classed
as
a
stranger
was
inexpressibly
painful
and
unused
to
encounter
difficulty
or
inconvenience
of
any
kind
she
shrank
from
receiving
cartwright
with
a
degree
of
weakness
which
made
her
son
who
had
seldom
left
her
side
tremble
to
think
how
little
she
was
calculated
to
endure
with
firmness
the
desolation
that
had
fallen
upon
her
oh
no
no
no
she
exclaimed
vehemently
i
can
not
see
him
i
can
see
no
one
keep
him
from
me
charles
keep
every
one
from
me
if
you
would
not
see
me
sink
to
the
earth
before
your
eyes
my
poor
mother
said
charles
tenderly
taking
her
hand
do
not
let
me
see
you
tremble
thus
you
will
make
me
tremble
too
and
we
have
need
of
strength
we
have
all
great
need
of
strength
in
this
time
of
trial
but
you
will
not
let
this
clergyman
come
to
me
charles
oh
no
you
can
not
be
so
cruel
the
very
weakness
which
makes
you
shrink
from
this
my
dearest
mother
is
the
strongest
proof
that
such
a
visit
should
be
sought
and
not
avoided
where
mother
are
we
any
of
us
to
look
for
the
strength
we
want
except
from
him
whose
minister
now
seeks
to
comfort
us
he
can
not
comfort
me
can
you
can
helen
can
my
pretty
fanny
comfort
me
then
how
should
he
charles
charles
there
is
no
comfort
in
seeing
this
strange
man
you
can
not
think
there
is
then
why
do
you
still
stand
with
his
note
in
your
hand
as
if
doubtful
how
you
ought
to
answer
it
no
mother
i
am
not
doubtful
my
very
soul
seems
to
sink
within
me
when
i
think
that
he
whose
precepts
tears
copious
tears
choked
the
utterance
of
the
athletic
youth
who
looked
as
if
he
could
fight
and
conquer
in
any
strife
to
which
fortune
or
misfortune
could
lead
him
but
the
softness
that
now
mastered
him
came
not
of
weakness
but
of
strength
strength
of
every
feeling
that
might
do
honour
to
a
man
for
a
few
moments
he
gave
way
to
this
burst
of
passionate
sorrow
and
the
mother
and
son
wept
together
my
own
dear
charles
said
mowbray
taking
his
hand
and
pressing
it
to
her
heart
how
could
i
think
for
a
moment
that
you
would
urge
me
to
do
what
was
so
very
painful
it
can
hardly
be
so
painful
for
you
to
do
as
for
me
to
urge
it
dearest
mother
and
yet
i
must
do
so
because
i
think
it
right
there
is
no
other
person
in
the
world
i
think
of
what
rank
or
station
soever
for
whose
admittance
i
would
plead
so
earnestly
unless
it
were
one
who
like
this
gentleman
offered
to
visit
you
as
the
minister
of
god
mowbray
buried
her
face
in
her
handkerchief
and
turned
from
him
with
a
movement
of
impatience
at
this
moment
helen
and
her
constant
attendant
rosalind
entered
the
room
cartwright
note
was
still
in
charles
hand
and
he
gave
it
to
his
sister
saying
helen
i
think
my
mother
ought
not
to
refuse
this
visit
but
she
is
very
averse
to
it
i
would
not
pain
her
for
the
world
but
this
is
not
a
moment
to
refuse
any
one
who
offers
to
visit
us
as
the
minister
of
heaven
helen
read
the
note
and
her
pale
cheeks
were
washed
anew
with
tears
as
she
did
so
it
is
meant
kindly
she
said
as
she
laid
it
upon
the
table
but
it
is
very
soon
for
my
poor
mother
to
meet
a
stranger
rosalind
eyes
rested
on
the
folded
note
and
some
feeling
suggested
by
the
consciousness
that
she
too
was
almost
a
stranger
brought
a
flush
to
her
cheek
and
led
her
to
step
back
towards
a
distant
sofa
whether
charles
observed
or
understood
the
movement
she
knew
not
but
he
followed
and
placed
the
letter
in
her
hand
the
words
of
helen
seemed
to
comfort
her
mother
for
she
again
looked
up
and
addressing
charles
almost
reproachfully
said
your
sister
helen
thinks
as
i
do
charles
it
would
almost
be
an
outrage
against
decency
to
receive
a
stranger
on
such
a
day
as
this
had
the
request
to
wait
upon
you
come
from
our
late
clergyman
mother
would
you
have
refused
it
certainly
not
but
he
was
a
friend
of
long
standing
not
a
stranger
charles
but
had
he
not
been
a
clergyman
mother
you
would
hardly
have
wished
him
to
choose
such
a
time
to
make
a
visit
here
and
our
not
having
yet
become
familiar
with
cartwright
in
the
common
intercourse
of
society
seems
to
me
no
sufficient
reason
for
refusing
to
see
him
in
the
sacred
character
in
which
he
has
offered
to
come
some
powerful
emotion
checked
his
utterance
but
in
a
moment
he
added
i
would
wish
once
more
to
pray
beside
my
father
before
he
goes
hence
to
be
no
more
seen
by
us
on
earth
mother
cried
helen
dropping
on
her
knees
and
throwing
her
arms
round
her
the
appeal
was
answered
by
an
embrace
in
which
their
tears
mingled
and
poor
mowbray
whose
aching
heart
seemed
to
dread
every
new
emotion
said
while
something
like
a
shudder
ran
through
her
frame
do
with
me
as
you
will
my
children
i
can
not
bear
much
more
but
perhaps
it
would
be
better
for
me
that
i
should
sink
to
rest
beside
him
my
dearest
friend
exclaimed
rosalind
coming
softly
towards
her
and
impressing
a
kiss
upon
her
forehead
you
have
not
lost
all
for
which
you
might
wish
to
live
oh
true
most
true
where
is
my
poor
fanny
rosalind
you
will
answer
this
letter
for
me
charles
i
will
be
ready
to
see
cartwright
whenever
he
chooses
to
come
it
will
be
a
dreadful
trial
but
i
am
willing
to
endure
it
the
young
man
left
the
room
and
such
an
answer
was
returned
to
the
clergyman
note
as
brought
him
to
the
door
within
an
hour
after
it
was
despatched
rosalind
in
obedience
to
mowbray
hint
had
sought
fanny
in
her
chamber
where
she
seemed
to
find
a
sad
consolation
in
versifying
all
the
tender
recollections
of
her
lost
father
that
her
memory
could
supply
but
she
instantly
obeyed
the
summons
and
when
cartwright
arrived
the
whole
family
were
assembled
in
the
to
receive
him
the
person
voice
and
address
of
this
gentleman
were
singularly
well
calculated
to
touch
and
soothe
hearts
suffering
from
affliction
and
after
the
first
painful
moment
in
which
they
raised
their
eyes
to
meet
those
of
the
first
stranger
who
had
been
admitted
to
look
upon
their
sorrow
there
was
nothing
in
the
interview
to
justify
the
terror
with
which
the
thought
of
it
had
inspired
the
poor
widow
either
from
tact
or
feeling
cartwright
seemed
to
avoid
speaking
to
mowbray
and
it
was
to
her
son
that
he
addressed
such
words
as
the
occasion
called
for
meanwhile
from
time
to
time
his
eyes
rested
with
gentle
pity
on
the
three
beautiful
girls
whose
tears
flowed
silently
as
they
listened
to
him
but
though
the
manner
of
cartwright
was
full
of
the
tenderest
kindness
it
was
apparently
embarrassed
he
evidently
feared
to
touch
or
to
dwell
upon
the
agonising
subject
which
occupied
all
their
thoughts
and
it
was
charles
who
had
the
courage
to
turn
this
melancholy
meeting
to
the
only
purpose
for
which
it
could
be
desirable
by
saying
though
with
a
faltering
voice
cartwright
may
we
ask
you
to
pray
with
us
beside
the
coffin
that
contains
the
body
of
my
father
the
clergyman
started
and
his
countenance
expressed
a
mixture
of
satisfaction
and
surprise
his
manner
instantly
became
more
solemn
more
devout
and
he
replied
eagerly
rising
from
his
chair
as
he
spoke
as
if
willing
to
hasten
to
the
scene
to
which
he
was
called
most
gladly
most
joyfully
my
dear
sir
will
i
kneel
with
you
and
your
amiable
family
to
implore
the
divine
grace
i
did
not
know
i
had
hardly
dared
to
hope
indeed
i
feared
from
the
festivities
from
the
style
in
which
i
trust
sir
interrupted
young
mowbray
almost
in
a
whisper
that
you
do
not
suppose
us
unused
to
prayer
because
we
have
rejoiced
in
the
blessings
which
heaven
has
bestowed
i
thank
my
god
that
it
is
not
so
replied
the
clergyman
pressing
the
young
man
hand
affectionately
and
i
will
praise
his
holy
name
for
every
symptom
i
find
that
the
world
my
dear
young
friend
has
not
taken
too
strong
a
hold
upon
your
heart
may
we
through
his
grace
walk
righteously
together
in
the
path
in
which
it
hath
pleased
him
to
place
us
side
by
side
charles
mowbray
heart
was
ever
open
to
every
expression
of
kindness
and
now
softened
by
sorrow
and
warmed
by
a
feeling
of
the
purest
piety
he
returned
the
friendly
pressure
with
interest
and
then
taking
his
poor
mother
arm
within
his
own
led
the
way
to
the
chamber
of
death
the
mourning
family
knelt
beside
the
coffin
and
listened
with
suppressed
sobs
to
an
extempore
prayer
by
no
means
ill
suited
to
the
occasion
though
it
was
not
as
poor
charles
had
expected
chosen
from
among
the
many
solemn
and
beautiful
orisons
which
the
church
has
furnished
or
which
the
scriptures
might
supply
for
such
an
hour
of
need
but
he
was
not
disposed
at
this
moment
to
cavil
at
any
words
calculated
to
raise
his
thoughts
and
those
of
the
beings
he
most
fondly
loved
to
that
power
which
had
hitherto
blessed
their
existence
and
from
whence
alone
they
could
hope
for
support
under
the
affliction
with
which
he
had
now
visited
them
fervently
and
earnestly
he
prayed
for
them
and
for
himself
and
when
he
rose
from
his
knees
and
again
pressed
his
suffering
mother
to
his
heart
it
was
with
a
feeling
of
renovated
hope
and
confidence
in
the
future
protection
of
heaven
which
nothing
but
prayer
uttered
with
genuine
piety
can
give
cartwright
did
not
take
his
leave
till
he
had
spoken
an
individual
blessing
to
each
of
them
which
was
accompanied
by
a
pressure
of
the
hand
that
seemed
to
express
more
sympathy
in
what
each
felt
than
any
words
could
have
done
young
mowbray
then
retired
with
him
to
arrange
everything
respecting
the
ceremony
which
was
to
take
place
on
the
morrow
his
mother
expressed
a
wish
to
lie
down
for
an
hour
and
the
three
girls
after
attending
her
to
her
room
carefully
shutting
out
the
light
in
the
hope
that
she
might
sleep
and
each
one
bidding
her
do
so
with
a
fond
caress
retreated
to
the
of
helen
when
their
conversation
naturally
turned
on
cartwright
this
gentleman
had
taken
possession
of
the
little
living
of
wrexhill
only
one
month
before
the
death
of
his
most
distinguished
parishioner
during
the
week
which
followed
his
first
performance
of
duty
in
the
church
the
family
at
the
park
made
a
visit
at
the
vicarage
for
though
cartwright
was
a
widower
he
had
a
daughter
nearly
twenty
years
of
age
who
as
mistress
of
her
father
house
was
of
course
visited
by
the
ladies
when
this
visit
was
returned
the
mowbray
family
were
all
absent
and
during
the
short
interval
which
followed
before
the
day
on
which
young
mowbray
came
of
age
the
preparations
for
the
fête
by
which
this
event
was
to
be
celebrated
had
prevented
cartwright
and
his
family
from
receiving
any
other
invitation
than
that
which
requested
their
attendance
at
it
this
having
been
declined
he
was
as
nearly
as
possible
a
personal
stranger
to
the
whole
mowbray
family
what
exquisite
benevolence
his
countenance
expresses
exclaimed
fanny
i
never
saw
eyes
so
full
of
gentleness
his
eyes
are
remarkably
handsome
replied
rosalind
but
i
am
not
quite
sure
that
i
like
him
the
moments
we
passed
with
him
were
moments
of
agony
said
helen
it
would
hardly
be
fair
to
pronounce
any
judgment
upon
him
from
such
an
interview
perhaps
you
are
right
dear
helen
and
i
will
endeavour
to
suspend
mine
replied
rosalind
but
at
least
i
may
venture
to
remark
that
he
is
a
very
father
for
the
son
and
daughter
we
have
seen
i
do
not
think
he
can
be
their
father
observed
fanny
perhaps
he
is
only
the
husband
of
their
mother
do
you
think
that
is
most
likely
helen
i
do
know
dear
answered
helen
i
believe
i
hardly
saw
him
i
really
doubt
if
you
did
my
poor
helen
said
rosalind
but
if
he
speak
sooth
he
could
not
say
the
same
of
us
if
the
reverend
gentleman
be
given
to
sketching
of
portraits
he
might
i
think
produce
a
good
likeness
of
either
of
us
for
like
hamlet
when
he
looked
at
ophelia
fell
to
such
perusal
of
our
faces
as
he
would
draw
them
i
do
not
think
i
shall
like
this
cartwright
i
do
not
mean
now
helen
i
speak
only
of
what
i
think
i
shall
do
when
i
know
more
of
him
do
you
call
that
suspending
your
judgment
rosalind
said
helen
with
a
feeble
smile
well
then
do
not
try
to
make
a
hypocrite
of
me
dearest
it
will
never
answer
wisdom
is
of
too
slow
a
growth
for
my
little
unprofitable
hotbed
of
an
intellect
which
forces
every
thought
to
run
up
to
full
growth
lanky
and
valueless
as
soon
as
it
is
sown
but
you
shall
transplant
some
of
my
notions
helen
into
the
fine
natural
soil
of
your
brain
and
then
if
they
flourish
we
shall
see
what
they
are
really
worth
for
all
reply
the
pale
helen
shook
her
head
as
one
who
knows
not
well
what
has
been
said
to
him
and
the
conversation
languished
and
dropped
as
every
other
had
done
since
the
blow
had
fallen
which
had
levelled
her
young
and
joyous
spirit
to
the
dust
chapter
iv
the
will
the
day
which
saw
the
honoured
remains
of
mowbray
committed
to
the
tomb
was
one
of
dreadful
suffering
to
his
family
and
to
none
more
than
to
his
son
who
with
a
heart
swelling
with
the
most
genuine
grief
was
obliged
to
assume
the
garb
of
ceremony
and
do
the
now
gloomy
honours
of
the
mansion
to
many
of
the
same
friends
and
neighbours
who
had
so
recently
received
the
joyous
greeting
of
his
father
most
thankful
was
he
for
the
relief
which
followed
the
departure
of
the
last
of
those
who
came
to
do
honour
to
these
splendid
obsequies
and
most
soothing
was
it
to
his
wounded
and
weary
spirits
to
find
himself
once
more
surrounded
only
by
those
who
could
read
in
a
look
all
he
wished
to
express
and
who
required
no
welcome
to
share
in
the
sorrow
of
that
bitter
day
but
like
all
other
periods
of
human
life
whether
marked
by
sorrow
or
by
joy
it
passed
away
with
as
even
and
a
pace
as
if
no
event
distinguished
it
from
its
fellow
days
and
then
by
slow
but
sure
degrees
the
little
trifling
ordinary
routine
of
daily
circumstance
came
with
its
invisible
and
unnoticed
magic
to
efface
or
at
least
to
weaken
feelings
which
seemed
to
have
been
impressed
by
the
stamp
of
burning
iron
on
their
souls
charles
mowbray
had
not
yet
taken
his
degree
and
wishing
to
do
so
as
soon
as
possible
he
was
anxious
to
return
to
christ
church
without
delay
but
his
father
will
had
not
yet
been
opened
and
at
the
request
of
his
mother
he
postponed
his
departure
till
this
could
be
done
this
important
document
was
in
the
hands
of
sir
gilbert
harrington
an
intimate
friend
and
neighbour
who
being
in
london
at
the
time
of
mowbray
death
had
been
unable
to
obey
the
summons
sent
to
him
in
time
to
attend
the
funeral
but
within
a
week
after
he
arrived
and
the
following
morning
was
fixed
upon
for
this
necessary
business
the
persons
present
were
sir
gilbert
harrington
cartwright
a
respectable
solicitor
from
the
country
town
who
had
himself
drawn
the
instrument
and
charles
mowbray
it
was
dated
rather
more
than
ten
years
back
and
after
the
usual
preamble
ran
thus
in
order
that
my
children
or
any
other
persons
whom
it
may
concern
may
know
the
reason
and
motive
of
the
disposition
of
my
property
which
i
am
about
to
make
it
is
necessary
that
i
should
therewith
state
the
manner
of
my
marriage
with
clara
helena
frances
my
wife
notwithstanding
her
vast
possessions
i
wooed
and
married
her
solely
because
i
loved
her
and
this
she
had
the
generosity
to
believe
though
i
was
nearly
penniless
having
nothing
but
my
true
affection
and
good
blood
to
offer
in
return
for
all
the
wealth
she
brought
for
several
months
she
withstood
my
earnest
solicitations
for
an
immediate
union
because
had
she
married
before
she
became
of
age
her
guardian
would
have
insisted
upon
settlements
and
restrictions
which
would
have
deprived
me
of
all
control
over
her
property
nor
would
she
subsequently
sign
any
document
whatever
previous
to
her
marriage
thereby
rendering
me
the
sole
possessor
of
her
fortune
wherefore
to
show
my
sense
of
this
unparalleled
confidence
and
generosity
i
hereby
make
her
the
sole
inheritrix
of
all
i
possess
to
be
ultimately
disposed
of
according
wholly
and
solely
to
her
own
own
will
and
pleasure
and
then
followed
with
every
necessary
and
unnecessary
technicality
of
the
law
such
a
disposition
of
his
property
as
left
his
children
entirely
dependent
on
their
mother
both
for
their
present
and
future
subsistence
that
this
will
was
very
different
from
anything
that
charles
mowbray
expected
is
most
certain
and
there
might
perhaps
have
been
some
slight
feeling
of
disappointment
at
finding
himself
dependent
even
upon
his
mother
but
if
such
there
were
it
was
not
sufficiently
strong
to
prevent
his
doing
justice
to
the
noble
feeling
which
had
led
to
it
and
in
truth
he
felt
so
certain
of
the
fond
affection
of
his
mother
that
not
a
shadow
of
fear
either
for
his
own
interest
or
that
of
his
sisters
crossed
his
mind
the
lawyer
who
read
aloud
the
deed
he
had
penned
had
of
course
no
observation
to
make
upon
it
and
cartwright
only
remarked
that
it
was
a
proof
of
very
devoted
love
and
confidence
of
the
small
party
present
at
this
lecture
sir
gilbert
harrington
was
the
only
one
who
testified
any
strong
emotion
respecting
it
and
his
displeasure
and
vexation
were
expressed
in
no
very
measured
terms
his
warmth
was
at
length
checked
not
because
he
had
uttered
all
he
had
to
say
but
because
he
met
the
eye
of
cartwright
fixed
upon
him
with
a
sort
of
scrutiny
that
was
unpleasing
to
his
feelings
he
therefore
stopped
short
in
the
philippic
he
was
pouring
forth
upon
the
infernal
folly
of
a
man
acting
in
matters
of
importance
without
consulting
his
friends
and
taking
the
arm
of
charles
walked
through
the
hall
into
the
grounds
without
appearing
to
remember
that
as
he
was
left
joint
executor
with
mowbray
to
the
will
it
might
be
expected
that
he
should
make
some
notification
of
its
contents
to
her
before
he
left
the
house
shall
we
not
speak
to
my
mother
sir
gilbert
said
mowbray
endeavouring
to
restrain
the
eager
step
of
the
baronet
as
he
was
passing
through
the
no
sir
was
the
laconic
reply
and
on
he
stalked
with
a
more
rapid
step
than
before
the
conversation
which
passed
between
them
during
the
hour
which
intervened
before
sir
gilbert
clambered
up
to
his
saddle
and
galloped
off
was
made
up
of
something
between
lamentation
and
anathema
on
his
side
and
the
most
earnest
assurances
that
no
mischief
could
ensue
from
his
father
will
on
the
part
of
charles
the
testy
old
gentleman
could
not
however
be
wrought
upon
to
see
the
widow
who
as
he
said
must
have
used
most
cursed
cunning
in
obtaining
such
a
will
of
which
however
poor
lady
she
was
as
innocent
as
the
babe
unborn
and
he
at
length
left
the
park
positive
that
he
should
have
a
fit
of
the
gout
and
that
the
widow
mowbray
would
marry
within
a
year
as
soon
as
he
had
got
rid
of
his
but
passionate
old
friend
mowbray
hastened
to
repair
the
neglect
he
had
been
forced
into
committing
and
sought
his
mother
in
the
but
she
was
no
longer
there
the
room
indeed
appeared
to
be
wholly
untenanted
and
he
was
on
the
point
of
leaving
it
to
seek
his
mother
elsewhere
when
he
perceived
that
miss
torrington
was
seated
at
the
most
distant
corner
of
it
almost
concealed
by
the
folds
of
the
farthest
rosalind
he
exclaimed
are
you
hid
there
where
are
all
the
rest
and
how
come
you
to
be
left
alone
i
am
left
alone
mowbray
because
i
wished
it
helen
and
fanny
are
with
your
mother
i
believe
in
her
room
charles
wished
to
see
them
all
and
to
see
them
together
and
had
almost
turned
to
go
but
there
was
something
in
the
look
and
manner
of
rosalind
that
puzzled
him
and
going
up
to
her
he
said
kindly
is
anything
the
matter
rosalind
you
look
as
if
something
had
vexed
you
to
his
great
astonishment
she
burst
into
tears
and
turning
from
him
as
if
to
hide
an
emotion
she
could
not
conquer
she
said
go
go
mowbray
go
to
your
mother
you
ought
to
have
gone
to
her
instantly
instantly
when
what
do
you
mean
miss
torrington
miss
torrington
means
mowbray
that
it
would
in
every
way
have
been
more
proper
for
you
to
have
announced
to
your
mother
yourself
the
strange
will
it
has
pleased
your
father
to
leave
instead
of
sending
a
stranger
to
do
it
who
then
has
told
her
of
it
rosalind
was
it
the
lawyer
was
it
mr
humphries
no
sir
it
was
mr
cartwright
but
why
should
you
be
displeased
with
me
for
this
dear
rosalind
sir
gilbert
led
me
out
of
the
library
by
force
and
would
not
let
me
go
to
my
mother
as
i
wished
to
do
and
i
have
but
this
instant
got
rid
of
him
but
i
did
not
commission
either
cartwright
or
any
one
else
to
make
a
communication
to
her
which
i
was
particularly
desirous
of
making
myself
you
did
not
send
cartwright
to
her
said
rosalind
colouring
and
looking
earnestly
in
his
face
no
indeed
i
did
not
did
he
say
i
had
sent
him
how
very
strange
it
is
she
replied
after
a
moment
consideration
that
i
should
be
perfectly
unable
to
say
whether
he
did
or
did
not
i
certainly
do
not
remember
that
he
explicitly
said
your
son
has
sent
me
here
but
this
i
do
remember
that
somehow
or
other
i
understood
that
you
had
done
so
and
how
did
he
announce
to
my
mother
that
she
i
mean
how
did
he
communicate
to
her
the
purport
of
my
father
will
charles
mowbray
exclaimed
rosalind
passionately
clenching
her
small
hands
and
stamping
her
little
foot
upon
the
ground
i
may
be
a
very
very
wicked
girl
i
know
i
am
wilful
headstrong
obstinate
and
vain
and
call
me
also
suspicious
what
you
will
but
i
do
hate
that
man
hate
whom
rosalind
said
charles
inexpressibly
astonished
at
her
vehemence
what
is
it
you
mean
is
it
cartwright
our
good
friendly
clergyman
that
you
hate
so
bitterly
go
to
your
mother
mowbray
i
am
little
more
than
seventeen
years
old
and
have
always
been
considered
less
instructed
and
therefore
sillier
of
course
than
was
to
be
expected
even
from
my
age
and
sex
then
will
it
not
be
worse
than
waste
of
time
to
inquire
what
i
mean
especially
when
i
confess
as
i
am
bound
to
do
that
i
do
not
well
know
myself
go
to
your
mother
charles
and
let
her
know
exactly
all
you
feel
you
at
least
have
no
cause
to
hide
your
faults
i
will
go
but
i
wish
i
knew
what
has
so
strangely
moved
you
ask
your
sisters
they
saw
and
heard
all
that
i
did
at
least
they
were
present
here
as
i
was
ask
them
examine
them
but
ask
me
nothing
for
i
do
believe
charles
that
i
am
less
to
be
depended
on
than
any
other
person
in
the
world
and
why
so
my
dear
rosalind
replied
mowbray
almost
laughing
do
you
mean
that
you
tell
fibs
against
your
will
yes
i
believe
so
at
least
i
feel
strangely
tempted
to
say
a
great
deal
more
than
i
positively
know
to
be
true
and
that
is
very
much
like
telling
fibs
i
believe
well
rosalind
i
will
go
for
you
grow
more
mysterious
every
moment
only
remember
that
i
should
greatly
like
to
know
all
the
thoughts
that
come
into
that
strange
little
head
of
yours
will
you
promise
that
i
shall
no
was
the
ungracious
reply
and
turning
away
she
left
the
room
by
a
door
that
led
into
a
conservatory
on
entering
his
mother
mowbray
found
her
seated
between
her
two
daughters
and
holding
a
hand
of
each
she
looked
up
as
he
entered
the
traces
of
tears
were
on
her
cheeks
and
her
eyes
rested
on
him
with
an
expression
of
melancholy
reproach
such
as
he
had
never
read
in
them
before
my
dear
dear
mother
he
exclaimed
as
he
approached
her
has
my
absence
then
vexed
you
so
grievously
i
could
not
help
it
mother
sir
gilbert
literally
made
me
his
prisoner
sir
gilbert
charles
might
have
shown
more
respect
to
the
memory
of
the
friend
he
has
lost
than
by
keeping
his
son
to
listen
to
his
own
wild
invectives
against
the
wife
that
friend
so
loved
and
trusted
whoever
has
repeated
to
you
the
hasty
expressions
of
sir
gilbert
my
dear
mother
in
such
a
manner
as
to
leave
a
painful
impression
on
your
mind
against
him
has
not
acted
well
you
know
his
temper
but
you
know
his
heart
also
and
i
should
not
have
thought
that
it
could
have
been
in
the
power
of
any
one
to
make
you
doubt
the
real
friendship
of
sir
gilbert
for
us
all
surely
charles
it
was
no
symptom
of
friendship
to
me
to
say
that
your
dear
father
had
made
an
accursed
will
good
heavens
what
a
strange
misrepresentation
mother
and
all
hanging
as
it
should
seem
upon
one
little
syllable
our
friend
as
you
well
know
is
what
rosalind
calls
a
manish
man
he
denies
the
supremacy
of
woman
and
might
and
i
verily
believe
did
say
that
a
will
which
vested
power
in
her
must
be
a
cursed
will
but
we
know
too
well
his
coarseness
of
expression
to
greatly
marvel
at
that
but
for
the
solemn
and
most
awful
word
believe
me
mother
he
never
said
it
it
matters
little
my
dear
son
what
particular
words
of
abuse
sir
gilbert
uttered
against
me
provided
that
your
heart
did
not
echo
them
mother
dearest
mother
cried
helen
rising
and
going
towards
her
brother
who
seemed
petrified
at
the
words
he
heard
how
for
a
single
moment
could
you
believe
that
charles
heart
could
echo
any
word
that
spoke
not
honour
and
love
towards
you
he
might
have
been
mistaken
helen
replied
her
mother
with
a
heavy
sigh
charles
could
not
indeed
suspect
that
the
mother
his
dear
father
so
fully
trusted
should
prove
unworthy
of
the
but
let
us
quit
this
painful
theme
and
believe
me
my
children
that
the
first
wish
of
my
heart
is
to
prove
myself
worthy
of
his
trust
and
your
love
such
words
are
just
what
we
might
expect
to
hear
from
you
mother
said
mowbray
were
any
profession
from
you
to
us
necessary
but
i
would
gladly
forget
that
you
have
ever
thought
such
an
assurance
called
for
he
bent
down
and
kissed
her
fervently
and
then
making
a
sign
to
helen
who
seemed
about
to
follow
him
that
she
should
remain
where
she
was
he
walked
out
for
a
couple
of
hours
among
the
darkest
thickets
he
could
find
with
more
of
melancholy
feeling
than
had
ever
before
rested
on
his
spirits
chapter
the
aristocracy
of
wrexhill
there
was
no
longer
any
thing
to
prevent
charles
mowbray
return
to
oxford
and
the
following
day
the
time
of
his
departure
was
canvassed
and
at
length
fixed
for
the
early
part
of
the
following
week
during
the
few
days
that
intervened
mowbray
seemed
quite
to
have
forgotten
their
painful
conversation
respecting
the
will
she
resumed
all
her
former
confiding
tenderness
of
manner
and
told
him
before
they
parted
that
henceforward
his
liberal
allowance
would
be
doubled
the
day
preceding
his
departure
was
sunday
and
for
the
first
time
since
their
heavy
loss
the
whole
family
appeared
at

they
had
all
dreaded
the
moment
of
reappearing
before
the
eyes
of
the
little
village
world
and
of
thus
giving
public
notice
as
it
were
that
they
no
longer
required
to
be
left
to
mourn
in
secret
but
this
painful
ceremony
came
and
was
endured
like
those
that
had
preceded
it
and
poor
helen
as
she
laid
her
head
upon
her
pillow
exclaimed
what
is
there
that
we
could
not
bear
and
live
the
sad
parting
of
the
next
morning
having
also
passed
over
them
they
at
once
and
by
necessity
fell
into
the
mode
of
life
which
they
were
hereafter
to
pursue
but
dreary
and
heavy
was
the
change
that
had
fallen
on
them
and
it
was
long
ere
the
mere
act
of
assembling
for
their
daily
meals
ceased
to
be
a
source
of
suffering
for
fearful
was
the
blank
left
by
the
absence
of
the
kind
the
gentle
the
beloved
the
venerated
being
whose
voice
was
used
to
speak
a
blessing
and
a
welcome
over
every
repast
but
our
natures
seize
with
avidity
the
healing
balm
which
time
and
occupation
offer
much
variety
of
disposition
was
however
manifested
in
the
manner
in
which
each
one
of
the
family
sought
the
consolation
they
needed
mowbray
became
evidently
though
perhaps
unconsciously
better
both
in
health
and
spirits
from
the
time
that
her
neighbours
according
to
their
different
ranks
resumed
their
visits
of
friendship
civility
and
respect
she
had
testified
outwardly
excepting
to
such
an
eye
as
rosalind
more
intense
suffering
than
any
other
member
of
the
family
nor
was
this
in
the
smallest
degree
the
result
of
affectation
she
felt
all
and
more
than
all
that
she
had
ever
expressed
and
would
gladly
for
the
sake
of
her
poor
children
have
concealed
a
part
of
it
had
the
fibre
of
her
character
permitted
her
doing
so
but
she
was
demonstrative
by
nature
with
great
softness
and
sweetness
of
temper
was
joined
that
species
of
weakness
which
is
often
said
to
be
the
most
attractive
feature
in
the
female
character
a
weakness
that
induced
her
to
seize
gladly
and
gratefully
any
hand
extended
to
lead
her
and
which
while
it
made
her
distrust
herself
gave
most
sovereign
sway
and
masterdom
to
any
one
ready
and
willing
to
supply
the
strength
and
decision
of
purpose
which
she
wanted
many
female
philippics
have
been
penned
i
believe
against
that
manly
passion
for
superiority
which
leads
our
masters
to
covet
in
a
companion
chosen
for
life
the
temper
of
mind
here
described
but
i
am
tempted
to
think
that
this
longing
to
possess
a
being
that
wants
protection
far
from
demonstrating
a
disposition
prone
to
tyranny
shows
a
nature
disposed
to
love
and
to
cherish
in
a
manner
perfectly
accordant
to
the
most
perfect
of
married
life
but
on
the
other
hand
there
may
perhaps
be
more
of
fondness
than
judgment
in
those
who
make
such
mallability
of
mind
their
first
requisite
in
a
choice
so
awfully
important
mowbray
however
had
a
thousand
good
qualities
to
justify
the
devoted
affection
of
her
husband
generous
unsuspicious
and
confiding
she
was
almost
as
incapable
of
doubting
the
goodness
of
others
as
of
deserving
such
doubts
herself
though
heiress
to
immense
property
no
feeling
in
the
slightest
degree
approaching
to
pride
had
even
for
a
single
instant
swelled
her
heart
and
though
good
beautiful
and
accomplished
her
estimate
of
herself
was
lower
than
that
formed
of
her
by
any
other
human
being
her
heart
was
now
more
than
ever
opened
to
every
expression
of
sympathy
and
kindness
and
she
experienced
the
most
salutary
effects
from
admitting
those
who
uttered
such
yet
she
was
still
a
mourner
in
her
very
heart
and
soul
and
there
were
moments
in
which
she
felt
so
bitterly
that
all
her
youthful
affections
were
buried
and
every
hope
of
earthly
happiness
past
that
the
fair
young
faces
of
the
three
affectionate
girls
who
were
ready
to
devote
themselves
to
her
seemed
too
bright
and
beautiful
to
be
kept
within
the
influence
of
her
melancholy
and
she
often
sent
them
from
her
to
their
their
or
the
park
with
a
sort
of
feverish
anxiety
lest
their
youth
and
health
should
be
sacrificed
to
their
affection
for
her
helen
had
all
the
tenderness
with
none
of
the
weakness
of
her
character
she
soon
ceased
to
speak
of
her
father
except
occasionally
when
walking
or
sitting
quite
alone
with
rosalind
when
sheltering
boughs
or
thickening
twilight
might
conceal
the
working
features
of
her
face
even
from
her
at
such
a
moment
if
some
kind
caress
from
her
young
companion
touched
unawares
the
feelings
over
which
she
unceasingly
kept
guard
as
if
they
were
a
secret
treasure
too
precious
to
be
exposed
to
vulgar
eyes
she
would
from
time
to
time
give
way
to
the
sacred
pleasure
of
discoursing
on
the
character
of
the
father
she
had
lost
but
she
had
resumed
all
her
former
occupations
and
added
to
them
the
far
from
unpleasing
task
of
imparting
to
rosalind
much
that
had
either
been
ill
taught
or
altogether
neglected
in
her
early
education
this
as
well
as
their
affection
for
each
other
kept
them
much
together
without
any
blameable
desertion
either
of
mowbray
or
fanny
for
the
former
was
really
wretched
if
she
thought
they
confined
themselves
too
much
to
her
and
herself
and
the
latter
was
hourly
becoming
more
devoted
to
solitary
study
and
to
speculations
too
poetical
and
sublime
to
be
shared
by
any
one
less
romantic
and
imaginative
than
herself
the
neighbourhood
was
not
a
large
one
mowbray
park
and
the
estate
attached
to
it
stretched
itself
so
far
in
all
directions
that
oakley
the
residence
of
sir
gilbert
harrington
the
nearest
landed
proprietor
was
at
the
distance
of
more
than
a
mile
the
little
village
of
wrexhill
however
had
one
or
two
pretty
houses
in
it
inhabited
by
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
moderate
but
independent
fortune
with
whom
the
family
at
the
park
associated
on
terms
of
intimacy
among
these
the
late
vicar
and
his
family
had
been
the
decided
favourites
of
the
whole
race
of
mowbrays
and
most
deservedly
so
for
the
father
was
a
man
of
piety
learning
and
most
amiable
deportment
his
wife
a
being
whose
temper
to
say
nothing
of
sundry
other
good
qualities
had
made
her
the
idol
of
the
whole
parish
and
his
two
sons
and
two
daughters
just
such
sons
and
daughters
as
such
parents
deserved
to
have
but
as
gregory
dobbs
the
old
parish
clerk
observed
after
officiating
at
the
funeral
of
mowbray
death
seemed
to
have
taken
a
spite
against
the
village
of
wrexhill
for
within
one
short
month
he
had
mowed
down
and
swept
away
the
two
best
and
men
in
the
parish
and
was
no
easy
matter
to
say
how
long
the
inhabitants
might
be
likely
to
wear
mourning
the
dispersion
and
departure
of
the
good
vicar
family
was
an
additional
misfortune
that
his
parishioners
had
not
looked
for
the
living
more
valuable
for
its
pleasant
house
and
pretty
glebe
than
for
its
revenue
was
in
the
gift
of
one
who
through
life
had
been
not
in
appearance
or
profession
only
but
in
most
true
sincerity
the
attached
friend
of
the
late
incumbent
and
edward
wallace
his
eldest
son
was
bred
to
the
church
with
the
express
understanding
that
the
next
presentation
should
be
his
with
this
persuasion
the
young
man
first
act
on
the
death
of
his
father
was
to
tell
his
mother
and
sisters
that
they
should
continue
to
inhabit
the
home
they
had
so
long
loved
but
this
arrangement
was
speedily
overthrown
for
in
reply
to
the
letter
which
announced
the
death
of
his
father
to
sir
blackhouse
the
patron
of
the
living
he
received
the
following
answer
my
dear
fellow
as
the
devil
would
have
it
i
am
now
a
cabinet
minister
and
i
no
more
dare
give
the
living
to
your
tory
father
son
than
i
dare
blow
up
westminster
hall
or
pull
the
lord
nose
in
public
i
do
assure
you
i
am
very
sorry
for
this
for
i
believe
you
are
likely
to
be
as
good
a
man
as
your
excellent
father
who
when
he
was
my
tutor
had
certainly
no
notion
that
i
should
turn
out
such
a
radical
however
there
is
no
resisting
destiny
and
so
here
i
am
just
going
to
give
my
pretty
little
living
to
some
reverend
somebody
that
i
care
a
straw
about
because
my
lord
m
says
that
though
a
bit
of
a
saint
he
is
a
clerical
i
wish
edward
you
try
to
forget
all
the
fusty
old
nonsense
about
church
and
state
upon
my
life
i
do
are
my
dear
fellow
and
if
you
could
get
up
a
clever
pamphlet
on
the
tithe
laws
or
on
the
protestant
affinities
to
the
church
of
rome
or
anything
else
with
a
good
rich
vein
of
whiggery
running
through
it
i
really
think
i
might
still
be
able
to
do
something
for
you
do
think
of
this
and
believe
me
my
dear
fellow
very
affectionately
your
friend
c
blackhouse
this
most
disappointment
of
course
banished
the
wallace
family
from
wrexhill
and
the
regret
their
departure
left
was
so
general
that
it
would
be
hardly
saying
too
much
to
declare
that
no
interference
of
the
whig
government
however
personal
or
tyrannical
ever
produced
a
stronger
sensation
of
disgust
in
the
circle
to
which
its
influence
extended
than
this
it
was
greatly
owing
to
the
influence
of
mowbray
that
cartwright
his
son
and
daughter
were
visited
by
the
neighbourhood
on
their
arrival
but
the
obvious
injustice
and
impropriety
of
treating
with
indignity
and
disrespect
the
clergyman
who
was
placed
among
them
solely
because
they
would
have
preferred
one
of
their
own
choosing
had
led
the
benevolent
owner
of
the
great
house
to
banish
the
painful
feelings
to
which
this
unpopular
appointment
had
given
rise
and
before
he
died
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
those
who
looked
up
to
him
as
authority
had
followed
his
example
and
that
the
new
vicar
had
been
called
upon
by
all
the
visiting
families
of
wrexhill
the
handsomest
house
in
the
village
was
inhabited
by
a
widow
lady
still
young
enough
to
be
called
handsome
and
living
with
sufficient
show
to
be
supposed
rich
she
played
a
little
sang
a
little
sketched
a
little
and
talked
and
dressed
a
great
deal
some
people
declared
that
when
she
was
young
her
complexion
must
have
been
as
beautiful
as
that
of
miss
fanny
mowbray
but
these
were
only
the
young
farmers
who
did
not
know
rouge
when
they
saw
it
this
lady
whose
name
was
simpson
had
one
little
girl
a
pretty
little
creature
of
eight
years
old
who
was
sometimes
petted
and
played
with
till
she
was
completely
spoiled
and
sometimes
left
in
the
nursery
for
days
together
while
her
mamma
was
absorbed
in
the
perusal
of
a
new
novel
or
the
fabrication
of
a
new
dress
at
the
next
turn
of
the
village
street
was
the
entrance
to
a
little
place
of
much
less
pretension
but
infinitely
prettier
and
in
better
taste
this
also
was
tenanted
by
a
fair
widow
who
had
she
not
been
surrounded
by
three
daughters
all
taller
than
herself
might
have
passed
for
being
as
young
and
as
handsome
as
simpson
she
was
however
as
little
like
her
as
possible
in
every
other
respect
being
subject
to
no
caprice
remarkably
simple
in
her
dress
and
her
hair
and
her
cheeks
always
remaining
of
the
colour
that
pleased
god
this
lady
had
been
early
left
a
widow
by
the
gallant
and
unfortunate
colonel
richards
who
lost
a
life
in
a
skirmish
with
the
native
troops
of
india
which
might
have
done
honour
to
his
country
in
a
nobler
field
what
his
young
widow
endured
in
returning
from
a
remote
part
of
the
country
to
madras
with
her
three
infants
and
very
little
means
had
doubtless
contributed
with
the
good
gifts
born
with
her
to
make
her
what
she
was
for
there
was
a
firmness
and
strength
of
mind
enveloped
in
her
miniature
frame
which
seemed
as
if
her
brave
husband
had
bequeathed
to
her
the
legacy
of
his
dauntless
spirit
to
sustain
her
under
all
the
privations
and
misery
his
early
death
left
her
to
encounter
alone
the
character
of
her
three
girls
will
be
easily
understood
hereafter
richards
cottage
was
the
only
residence
in
wrexhill
except
the
vicar
that
did
not
open
upon
the
village
street
so
that
she
had
no
immediate
neighbour
but
close
to
the
corner
of
the
pretty
field
that
fronted
her
dwelling
and
fed
her
cow
lived
a
bachelor
officer
who
among
many
other
excellent
qualities
possessed
one
which
made
him
interesting
in
her
eyes
he
had
known
colonel
richards
well
and
less
than
half
the
reverence
he
felt
for
his
memory
has
often
sufficed
to
enrich
the
church
of
rome
with
a
saint
it
was
not
major
dalrymple
fault
if
the
widow
of
his
umqwhile
commanding
officer
had
not
long
ago
exchanged
her
comparative
poverty
for
his
very
comfortable
independence
and
considering
that
he
was
five
years
younger
than
the
lady
was
the
presumptive
heir
to
a
noble
scotch
cousin
who
was
thought
consumptive
played
the
flute
exquisitely
and
was
moreover
a
tall
and
gentlemanly
figure
with
no
other
fault
imputed
to
him
than
a
somewhat
obstinate
pertinacity
of
attachment
to
herself
many
people
both
in
and
out
of
wrexhill
wondered
at
her
obduracy
especially
as
she
had
never
been
heard
to
say
even
by
her
most
intimate
friends
that
her
heart
was
buried
in
the
grave
of
her
dear
richards
the
remaining
aristocracy
of
wrexhill
need
hardly
be
enumerated
as
they
will
not
make
any
very
considerable
figure
in
the
following
pages
but
there
was
an
attorney
an
apothecary
and
a
schoolmaster
the
latter
indeed
was
an
excellent
person
of
whom
we
may
hear
more
in

the
principal
person
in
the
the
vicar
family
two
days
after
the
mowbray
family
appeared
at
church
the
village
gentry
began
to
offer
their
visits
of
condolence
which
happily
however
for
the
tranquillity
of
the
persons
chiefly
concerned
were
performed
in
the
improved
manner
of
modern
times
that

to

every
allusion
to
the

by
all
but

most
cautiously
avoided
by
all
parties
the
first
person
who
entered

was
simpson
on
all
occasions
indeed
this
lady
exerted
herself
to
sustain
the
position
of
the
principal
person
in
the
village
she
seldom
gave
an
order
for
the
fly
which
weak
as
were
its
own
springs
was
in
truth
the
of
all
the
rural
visitings
she
seldom
ordered
this
indispensable
commodity
without
adding
to
her
instructions
pray
be
punctual

i

this
for
your
sake
as
well
as
my

for

the
principal
person
in

village
is
made
to
wait
you
may
depend
upon
it
an
opposition
will
be
started
immediately
and
in
that

you

should
be

all

were
severally
and
collectively
given
to
understand
that
simpson
as
the
principal
person
in

village
had
a
right
to
expect
the
of
their
civility

and
general
her
entrance
into

presence
of

was
as
pregnant
with
sentiment

sympathy
as
the
degree
of
intimacy
to
which
she
was
admitted
would
permit
the

performed
with
a
little
pressure
and
a
little
sigh
every
pause
in
the
conversation
was
made
to
speak
volumes
by
the
sad
tone
in
which
the
next
sentence
was
spoken
in
short
if
the
minds
of
mowbray
her
eldest
daughter
and
her
ward
who
kindly
volunteered
to
sustain
this
ordeal
with
her
had
not
been
fully
occupied
by
the
recent
event
almost
every
word
look
and
gesture
of
the
principal
person

were
calculated
to
recall

was
accompanied
by
her
pretty

resemblance
to
a
bantam
chicken
as
it
was
possible
for
a
pretty
little
girl
to
take
the
distance
from
the
village
to
the
park
was
almost
too
great
for
so
young
a
child
to
walk
and
the
poor
little
thing
looked
heated
cross
and
weary
but
her
mamma
declared
that
a
ramble
through
those
delicious
fields
was
the
greatest
treat
in
the
world
i
trust
in
heaven
she
continued
using
her
to
look
at
a
drawing
which
lay
on
the
table
that
mimima
her
abbreviation
of
jemima
will
have
my
taste
for
sketching
i
like
to
take
her
out
with
me
dear
pet
she
enjoys
it
so
but
at
this
lovely
season
it
is
the
most
difficult
thing
in
the
world
not
to
sketch
as
one
goes
indeed
when
the
mind
is
a
sigh
every
object
however
a
pause
i
beg
your
pardon
but
it
is
so
difficult
come
to
me
jemima
said
helen
holding
out
her
hand
and
let
me
take
your
bonnet
off
the
child
put
up
her
shoulder
and
pressed
with
distressing
closeness
upon
the
delicate
lilac
of
her
mother
new
silk
dress
it
is
such
a
shy
puss
said
simpson
i
often
think
what
would
become
of
her
a
sigh
i
beg
your
pardon
but
sad
thoughts
will
press
little
girl
do
you
love
eau
de
cologne
said
rosalind
taking
a
bottle
from
the
table
and
holding
it
towards
her
either
the
look
the
accent
or
the
action
of
rosalind
had
attraction
sufficient
to
draw
the
child
towards
her
when
she
relieved
the
glowing
cheeks
from
the
stifling
encumbrance
of
a
very
close
pink
bonnet
and
thick
green
veil
and
then
copiously
bedewed
the
pretty
head
with
the
fragrant
and
refreshing
water
do
you
like
it
dear
yes
very
much
do
it
again
again
said
the
child
laughing
aloud
mimima
what
did
i
tell
you
dear
alas
young
heads
i
beg
your
pardon
a
sigh
you
are
too
good
i
fear
you
will
spoil
her
miss
torrington
i
am
only
trying
to
cool
her
a
little
she
looks
quite
in
a
fever
she
has
sported
along
before
me
like
a
little
fawn
i
brought
my
maid
and
the
man
servant
as
i
thought
they
might
carry
her
between
them
if
she
was
tired
but
she
would
not
hear
of
it
the
step
of
childhood
is
so
elastic
alas
i
beg
your
pardon
do
you
like
to
ride
miss
jemima
said
rosalind
struck
by
the
idea
of
the
maid
and
the
man
carrying
the
young
lady
between
them
what
is
that
inquired
the
child
rosalind
laughed
a
little
and
coloured
a
little
at
being
obliged
to
explain
herself
but
making
the
best
of
it
she
took
mimima
little
hands
and
interlaced
them
with
her
own
after
the
most
approved
manner
of
preparing
to
treat
somebody
with
riding
no
persons
resent
ridicule
so
much
as
those
who
are
perpetually
exposing
themselves
to
it
simpson
her
rouge
as
she
said
i
did
not
mean
miss
torrington
that
my
servants
were
to
carry
the
child
together
i
really
wonder
such
a
very
droll
i
beg
your
pardon
but
at
such
a
time
miss
torrington
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
and
then
rose
and
left
the
room
simpson
saw
that
she
had
offended
the
heiress
and
from
that
moment
conceived
towards
her
one
of
those
little
feminine
antipathies
which
if
they
do
not
as
often
lead
to
daggers
and
bowls
in
the
higher
ranks
of
society
as
to
black
eyes
and
broken
noses
in
the
lower
are
nevertheless
seldom
quite
innoxious
the
conversation
now
began
to
languish
for
the
principal
person
in
wrexhill
was
decidedly
out
of
humour
and
helen
was
painfully
seeking
for
what
she
was
to
say
next
when
the
door
was
thrown
open
and
and
miss
cartwright
and
jacob
cartwright
were
announced
no
sudden
and
unexpected
burst
of
sunshine
ever
produced
a
greater
change
in
the
aspect
of
a
watery
landscape
than
the
entrance
of
this
party
on
the
countenance
of
the
handsome
widow
had
rosalind
been
present
she
would
have
found
some
amusement
or
at
least
some
occupation
in
seeking
to
discover
whether
it
were
the
father
or
son
who
possessed
this
vivifying
power
to
the
pale
daughter
she
would
certainly
have
attributed
no
such
influence
but
as
we
have
not
her
help
to
decide
the
doubt
we
must
leave
the
matter
to
the
slower
hand
of
time
jacob
cartwright
was
a
tall
straight
young
man
but
as
yet
a
little
inclining
to
that
line
of
contour
which
can
only
be
described
by
the
expressive
word
lanky
neither
was
his
hair
handsome
for
designated
as
light
by
his
particular
friends
and
admirers
it
was
called
sandy
by
the
rest
of
the
world
but
the
young
gentleman
had
a
mouth
with
a
very
beautiful
set
of
teeth
and
a
large
clear
light
blue
eye
which
many
persons
declared
to
be
beautiful
this
young
man
was
said
to
resemble
greatly
the
mother
he
had
lost
to
his
father
he
was
certainly
as
unlike
as
possible
cartwright
though
somewhat
above
the
middle
height
was
shorter
than
his
son
and
his
person
incomparably
better
built
his
features
were
very
regularly
handsome
and
the
habitual
expression
of
his
countenance
gentle
and
attractive
his
eyes
were
large
dark
and
very
beautifully
formed
and
his
hair
and
beard
as
black
as
those
of
a
spaniard
save
here
and
there
a
silver
line
which
about
the
temples
began
to
mix
itself
with
the
sable
his
mouth
and
teeth
perhaps
might
have
been
said
to
resemble
those
of
his
son
had
not
the
expression
been
so
different
in
the
son
these
constituted
merely
a
feature
to
the
father
they
seemed
to
give
a
power
when
he
spoke
that
might
work
wonders
either
for
good
or
evil
henrietta
cartwright
resembled
neither
of
them
of
the
two
she
would
have
been
said
to
be
most
like
her
father
because
her
hair
and
eyes
were
dark
but
the
form
of
the
head
and
face
and
above
all
the
cynic
expression
of
the
mouth
were
in
perfect
contrast
to
his
like
her
brother
she
was
extremely
thin
but
she
was
not
proportionably
tall
and
in
her
this
ascetic
form
seemed
rather
the
result
of
ill
health
than
of
make
she
was
moreover
deadly
pale
and
seldom
spoke
in
general
society
if
she
could
possibly
avoid
it
mowbray
received
all
the
party
with
cordial
kindness
in
manner
there
was
a
shade
of
coldness
especially
to
the
father
whose
offered
hand
she
did
not
appear
to
see
but
the
whole
trio
shared
the
affectionate
greetings
of
simpson
how
lucky
i
am
to
meet
you
such
a
dismal
long
walk
all
alone
but
now
we
can
return
together
how
are
you
my
dear
miss
henrietta
has
your
headache
left
you
no
oh
how
i
grieve
to
see
you
suffer
so
i
need
not
inquire
for
you
jacob
what
a
picture
of
youth
and
activity
you
are
mimima
come
here
do
you
remember
your
friend
do
you
remember
jacob
cartwright
ah
i
thought
you
could
not
forget
him
you
would
not
be
your
mother
child
dearest
if
you
could
ever
forget
kindness
in
her
address
to
the
elder
gentleman
there
seemed
to
be
a
little
more
caution
in
the
expression
of
her
affectionate
feelings
but
she
looked
at
him
and
she
listened
to
him
and
more
than
once
repeated
what
he
said
as
if
to
impress
the
precious
words
on
her
memory
in
short
from
the
moment
the
vicar
and
his
family
entered
the
room
it
was
evident
the
ladies
of
the
park
were
completely
put
in
non
cale
and
this
considering
the
undeviating
respect
which
through
life
simpson
had
ever
paid
to
wealth
and
station
was
no
trifling
proof
of
the
sincerity
of
that
friendship
which
she
professed
for
her
new
friends
i
hope
your
youngest
daughter
is
well
and
miss
torrington
also
said
cartwright
quite
well
thank
you
helen
do
you
know
where
your
sister
is
in
the
library
i
believe
mamma
miss
cartwright
would
you
not
like
some
refreshment
do
ring
the
bell
helen
i
am
sure
simpson
you
ought
to
take
some
after
your
long
walk
it
was
not
difficult
to
see
that
this
civility
was
the
result
of
a
strong
and
painful
effort
on
the
part
of
mowbray
and
helen
was
provoked
with
the
whole
party
for
not
declining
it
but
no
choice
was
left
her
the
bell
was
rung
and
the
tray
arrived
one
comfort
she
had
and
that
no
trifling
one
neither
herself
nor
her
mother
had
any
further
occasion
to
seek
subjects
of
conversation
simpson
took
the
whole
of
this
troublesome
business
upon
herself
and
for
the
period
that
the
luncheon
lasted
was
so
completely
engaged
in
eating
and
talking
that
she
had
not
time
for
a
single
sigh
the
two
gentlemen
and
the
little
girl
were
very
nearly
as
busily
employed
as
herself
but
miss
cartwright
sat
silently
apart
and
a
feeling
as
nearly
allied
perhaps
to
curiosity
as
politeness
induced
helen
to
change
her
place
and
seat
herself
near
her
will
you
not
take
some
refreshment
miss
cartwright
let
me
get
you
some
grapes
i
thank
you
none
not
even
a
little
and
wine
the
morning
seems
unusually
warm
nothing
i
thank
you
are
you
a
great
walker
yes
this
is
a
charming
country
for
it
such
a
beautiful
variety
of
lanes
and
fields
i
seldom
vary
my
walk
indeed
and
what
is
the
favourite
spot
you
have
chosen
the
ugliest
and
most
gloomy
i
could
find
that
i
might
be
sure
of
never
meeting
any
one
helen
was
silenced
she
had
not
courage
for
another
word
and
in
order
to
cover
her
retreat
moved
towards
the
table
and
bestowed
her
attention
on
the
little
girl
who
totally
forgotten
by
her
mamma
was
quaffing
long
draughts
of
wine
from
a
tumbler
which
jacob
had
been
preparing
for
himself
but
which
he
had
willingly
yielded
to
her
and
now
seemed
waiting
for
the
inevitable
effect
of
such
excess
with
a
sort
of
sly
and
covert
glee
that
made
helen
very
angry
your
little
girl
will
make
herself
ill
i
am
afraid
simpson
by
the
quantity
of
wine
she
is
taking
i
am
afraid
there
is
no
water
with
it
the
lady
who
was
talking
very
earnestly
in
an
under
tone
to
cartwright
started
at
this
appeal
and
with
a
glance
of
more
anger
than
the
age
of
the
child
could
justify
drew
her
back
from
the
table
and
made
her
stand
at
some
distance
from
it
i
really
think
that
it
is
jacob
cartwright
who
should
be
punished
said
helen
for
he
knew
a
great
deal
more
about
the
matter
than
the
little
girl
herself
oh
no
naughty
little
thing
said
the
mamma
i
am
very
sorry
if
i
have
been
the
occasion
of
the
little
girl
doing
what
was
wrong
said
jacob
slowly
and
in
a
very
gentle
tone
i
did
not
think
she
would
have
taken
so
much
and
she
looked
very
tired
and
warm
simpson
made
some
civil
answer
and
turned
to
renew
her
conversation
with
the
vicar
but
he
was
gone
she
positively
started
and
looked
about
her
with
great
interest
to
discover
what
had
become
of
him
the
windows
of
the
room
opened
upon
the
lawn
and
though
she
had
not
seen
his
exit
she
very
naturally
guessed
that
it
must
have
been
made
in
that
direction
after
rising
from
the
table
and
making
one
or
two
unmeaning
movements
about
the
room
taking
up
a
book
and
laying
it
down
again
without
looking
at
its
title
examining
a
vase
on
the
and
a
rose
on
the
she
gradually
drew
towards
the
open
window
and
after
pausing
for
half
a
minute
walked
through
it
upon
the
grass
the
little
girl
trotted
after
her
jacob
followed
probably
hoping
to
see
her
stagger
about
a
little
and
helen
though
sadly
vexed
at
this
new
device
to
prolong
the
tedious
visit
could
do
no
less
than
walk
after
them
the
conservatory
and
library
formed
this
side
of
the
house
the
whole
range
of
windows
opening
uniformly
upon
the
lawn
as
helen
stepped
out
she
perceived
that
the
party
who
had
preceded
her
were
entering
by
the
window
of
the
library
and
she
quickly
followed
them
thinking
it
probable
that
fanny
might
be
startled
and
vexed
at
this
unexpected
interruption
when
as
was
very
likely
she
might
be
in
the
very
act
of
invoking
the
sacred
nine
upon
entering
the
room
however
she
found
her
sister
to
her
great
surprise
conversing
earnestly
with
cartwright
and
appearing
to
be
hardly
yet
conscious
of
the
presence
of
the
others
simpson
gave
a
little
almost
imperceptible
toss
of
the
head
at
discovering
how
the
gentleman
was
engaged
we
could
not
think
whither
you
had
vanished
cartwright
said
she
in
her
sweetest
voice
but
you
really
were
very
lucky
to
ramble
in
this
direction
miss
fanny
ought
to
have
her
picture
taken
in
this
fine
room
with
all
her
books
about
her
while
she
said
this
cartwright
continued
in
a
whisper
to
finish
what
he
was
addressing
to
fanny
and
having
done
so
he
turned
to
the
party
which
had
followed
him
saying
the
bright
verdure
of
your
beautiful
lawn
miss
mowbray
tempted
me
out
but
i
hope
our
intrusion
has
not
disturbed
your
sister
fanny
answered
eagerly
that
she
was
very
glad
to
see
him
at
that
moment
helen
chanced
to
turn
her
eyes
towards
the
window
by
which
they
entered
when
she
perceived
that
miss
cartwright
had
followed
them
she
was
however
more
than
half
concealed
by
a
large
orange
tree
which
stood
in
a
high
square
box
beside
the
window
but
her
head
was
bent
forward
to
look
into
the
room
and
a
sneer
of
such
very
singular
expression
rested
on
her
lip
and
in
her
eye
as
she
looked
at
her
father
and
fanny
who
were
still
standing
close
together
that
helen
remained
perfectly
still
staring
at
her
in
another
moment
miss
cartwright
changed
the
direction
of
her
eyes
and
encountered
those
of
helen
fixed
upon
her
with
a
look
of
unconcealed
astonishment
but
her
own
did
not
sink
before
them
and
she
turned
away
with
a
smile
quite
as
strange
and
unintelligible
as
the
look
she
had
bestowed
on
fanny
at
length
this
tedious
visit
was
brought
to
its
conclusion
the
bonnet
of
the
tipsy
and
now
very
pale
little
girl
was
replaced
a
number
of
civil
speeches
spoken
and
the
whole
party
walked
off
together
across
the
lawn
to
a
gate
which
was
to
take
them
by
a
short
cut
through
the
park
i
quite
envy
simpson
her
walk
home
said
fanny
i
see
she
has
taken
cartwright
arm
i
really
do
think
he
is
the
very
handsomest
and
most
agreeable
man
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
chapter
vii
the
first
impressions
made
by
mr
letter
from
lady
harrington
the
three
girls
rallied
round
mowbray
as
soon
as
the
guests
had
departed
all
kindly
anxious
to
see
how
she
bore
this
first
step
back
into
a
world
so
wholly
changed
for
her
she
looked
pale
and
there
was
an
air
of
languor
and
weariness
about
her
nevertheless
to
the
great
surprise
of
helen
she
expressed
herself
much
pleased
by
the
visit
cartwright
said
she
appears
to
me
to
be
one
of
the
most
amiable
men
i
ever
saw
every
tone
of
his
voice
speaks
kindness
and
indeed
if
he
did
not
speak
at
all
one
look
of
his
has
more
feeling
and
pity
in
it
than
other
people
could
express
by
a
volume
of
words
do
you
really
think
so
mamma
said
helen
eagerly
but
suddenly
stopped
herself
aware
that
in
truth
she
had
no
grounds
whatever
for
the
strong
feeling
of
dislike
towards
him
of
which
she
was
conscious
she
remembered
too
that
her
father
had
expressed
himself
greatly
pleased
by
the
urbanity
of
his
manners
and
that
the
last
act
of
the
benign
influence
he
was
wont
to
exercise
on
those
around
him
had
been
to
conquer
the
prejudice
against
him
to
which
the
exclusion
of
the
wallace
family
had
unjustly
given
rise
helen
remembered
all
this
in
a
moment
the
colour
mounted
to
her
cheeks
and
she
was
silent
rosalind
too
was
silent
at
least
from
words
but
her
eyes
could
speak
as
many
volumes
at
a
glance
as
cartwright
and
she
fixed
them
for
an
instant
on
helen
with
a
look
that
told
her
plainly
her
prejudices
against
their
new
neighbour
however
unreasonable
were
fully
shared
by
her
meanwhile
fanny
had
thrown
her
arms
round
her
mother
neck
in
a
sort
of
rapture
at
hearing
her
own
opinions
confirmed
by
such
authority
oh
how
true
that
is
dearest
mamma
she
exclaimed
how
exactly
i
feel
the
same
when
he
speaks
to
me
such
goodness
such
gentleness
so
much
superiority
yet
so
much
humility
poor
dear
wallace
was
an
excellent
good
man
certainly
but
no
more
to
be
compared
to
cartwright
than
i
to
hercules
how
many
times
have
you
seen
cartwright
fanny
said
rosalind
i
have
heard
him
preach
three
times
she
replied
and
they
were
all
the
most
beautiful
sermons
in
the
world
and
i
have
seen
and
spoken
to
him
four
times
more
poor
mr
wallace
said
rosalind
it
was
he
who
christened
you
fanny
and
from
that
time
to
the
hour
of
his
death
you
seldom
passed
many
days
together
i
believe
without
seeing
and
receiving
affectionate
words
and
kind
looks
from
him
and
yet
four
times
speaking
to
this
gentle
gentleman
has
driven
the
memory
of
the
poor
old
man
from
your
heart
no
it
has
not
rosalind
replied
fanny
deeply
blushing
i
am
sure
i
did
not
say
that
did
i
mamma
but
my
loving
and
remembering
wallace
all
the
days
of
my
life
need
not
make
me
dislike
everybody
else
i
suppose
it
would
be
a
great
misfortune
to
you
if
it
did
fanny
said
mowbray
i
am
delighted
to
see
both
in
you
and
many
others
that
the
violent
and
most
unjustifiable
prejudice
which
was
conceived
against
cartwright
before
he
was
seen
and
known
is
giving
way
before
his
amiable
and
excellent
qualities
i
have
no
doubt
that
he
will
soon
be
quite
as
popular
in
the
parish
as
wallace
was
and
miss
cartwright
mamma
said
helen
do
you
think
we
shall
love
her
as
well
as
we
did
emma
wallace
i
know
nothing
whatever
of
miss
cartwright
as
yet
helen
she
appears
very
shy
but
we
must
try
to
give
her
courage
my
dear
girls
i
hope
we
shall
be
on
terms
of
as
great
intimacy
with
our
new
clergyman
as
with
our
former
one
it
was
a
sort
of
association
that
your
dear
father
particularly
approved
and
that
alone
is
a
sufficient
reason
for
our
wishing
to
cultivate
it
this
allusion
was
too
solemn
to
admit
any
light
conversation
to
follow
it
mowbray
strolled
with
fanny
into
the
conservatory
and
rosalind
persuaded
helen
that
they
should
find
the
shrubberies
infinitely
cooler
and
more
agreeable
than
the
house
but
even
under
the
thickest
cover
that
the
grounds
could
offer
helen
could
not
be
tempted
fully
to
open
her
heart
upon
the
subject
of
cartwright
an
indulgence
which
rosalind
certainly
expected
to
obtain
when
she
proposed
the
walk
but
the
name
of
her
father
had
acted
like
a
spell
on
helen
and
all
that
she
could
be
brought
positively
to
advance
on
the
subject
of
the
cartwright
family
was
that
she
did
not
think
miss
cartwright
was
shy
within
the
next
fortnight
nearly
every
one
who
claimed
a
visiting
acquaintance
with
the
mowbray
family
both
in
the
village
and
the
neighbourhood
round
it
had
called
at
the
park
all
the
calling
is
over
now
said
helen
and
i
am
very
glad
of
it
every
body
has
been
very
kind
and
attentive
replied
her
mother
and
next
week
we
must
begin
to
return
their
calls
i
hope
nobody
will
be
offended
for
some
of
them
must
be
left
for
many
days
the
weather
is
very
hot
and
the
horses
must
not
be
overworked
i
wonder
why
that
charming
little
person
that
i
fell
in
love
with
the
widow
i
mean
that
lives
in
the
cottage
at
wrexhill
said
rosalind
i
wonder
she
has
not
been
to
see
you
she
appeared
to
like
you
all
very
much
i
have
thought
of
that
two
or
three
times
replied
helen
i
think
if
they
had
any
of
them
been
ill
we
should
have
heard
it
and
yet
otherwise
i
can
not
account
for
such
inattention
it
is
merely
accidental
i
am
sure
said
mowbray
but
there
is
one
omission
helen
that
cuts
me
to
the
heart
tears
burst
from
her
eyes
as
she
spoke
poor
helen
knew
not
how
to
answer
she
was
well
aware
that
the
omission
her
mother
alluded
to
was
that
of
sir
gilbert
and
lady
harrington
and
she
knew
too
the
cause
of
it
lady
harrington
who
with
one
of
the
best
hearts
in
the
world
was
sometimes
rather
blunt
in
her
manner
of
showing
it
had
sent
over
a
groom
with
a
letter
to
helen
her
and
especial
favourite
very
fully
explaining
the
cause
of
their
not
calling
but
in
a
manner
that
could
in
no
degree
enable
her
to
remove
her
mother
uneasiness
respecting
it
this
letter
which
by
her
ladyship
especial
orders
was
delivered
privately
into
the
hands
of
helen
ran
thus
my
darling
child
ca
you
think
what
a
way
i
must
be
in
at
being
prevented
coming
to
see
you
sir
gilbert
excels
himself
this
time
for
obstinacy
and
wilfulness
every
breakfast
every
dinner
and
every
tea
since
it
happened
william
and
i
do
nothing
but
beg
and
entreat
that
i
may
be
permitted
to
go
over
and
see
your
poor
mother
good
gracious
as
i
tell
him
it
is
not
her
fault
though
god
knows
i
do
think
just
as
much
as
he
does
that
no
man
ever
did
make
such
a
of
a
will
as
your
father
such
a
man
as
charles
as
sir
gilbert
says
was
made
at
the
full
of
the
moon
my
dear
and
that
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
he
was
just
mad
helen
and
nothing
else
but
is
that
any
reason
that
your
poor
dear
mother
should
be
neglected
and
forsaken
this
way
god
bless
her
dear
soul
she
more
like
a
baby
than
any
thing
i
ever
saw
about
money
and
as
to
her
being
an
heiress
why
i
do
believe
upon
my
honour
that
she
has
ever
recollected
it
from
the
day
she
married
to
the
time
that
your
unlucky
poor
dear
distracted
madman
of
a
father
threw
all
her
money
back
at
her
in
this
wild
way
he
had
much
better
have
pelted
her
with
rotten
eggs
helen
such
a
friend
as
sir
gilbert
so
so
steady
and
so
true
is
not
to
be
found
every
day
old
tiger
as
he
is
but
what
on
earth
am
i
to
do
about
it
i
shall
certainly
go
mad
too
if
i
ca
get
at
you
and
yet
i
give
you
my
word
i
no
more
dare
order
the
coachman
to
drive
me
to
mowbray
park
than
to
the
devil
you
never
saw
such
a
tyrannical
brute
of
a
husband
as
sir
gilbert
is
making
himself
about
it
and
poor
william
too
he
really
speaks
to
him
as
if
he
were
a
little
in
the
streets
instead
of
a
colonel
of
dragoons
william
said
last
night
something
very
like
shall
ride
over
to
wrexhill
and
perhaps
i
shall
see
the
family
at
mow
i
wish
you
had
seen
him
i
only
wish
you
had
seen
sir
gilbert
helen
for
half
a
moment
you
would
never
have
forgotten
it
my
dear
and
it
might
have
given
you
a
hint
as
to
choosing
a
husband
never
marry
a
man
with
great
wide
open
eyes
and
enormous
black
eyebrows
for
fear
he
should
swallow
you
alive
some
day
before
you
know
where
you
are
them
sir
gilbert
you
do
by
g
d
sir
i
leave
every
sou
i
have
in
the
world
to
some
cursed
old
woman
myself
but
it
sha
be
to
you
madam
turning
short
round
as
if
he
would
bite
me
if
you
will
but
go
to
mowbray
if
you
dare
are
we
never
to
see
any
of
the
family
again
sir
said
the
colonel
very
meekly
never
told
you
so
colonel
booby
was
the
reply
may
see
that
glorious
fellow
charles
as
often
as
you
will
and
the
more
you
see
of
him
the
better
and
i
manage
if
i
can
as
soon
as
he
has
taken
this
degree
that
his
heart
set
upon
to
get
a
commission
for
him
in
your
regiment
so
you
need
not
palaver
about
my
wanting
to
part
you
from
him
and
as
for
you
my
lady
i
give
you
full
leave
to
kidnap
the
poor
destitute
penniless
girls
if
you
can
but
if
i
ever
catch
you
doing
any
thing
that
can
be
construed
into
respect
or
civility
to
that
sly
artful
hussy
who
cajoled
my
poor
friend
mowbray
to
make
that
cursed
will
may
i
you
shall
see
old
lady
what
will
come
of
it
now
what
on
earth
can
i
do
dear
darling
i
believe
your
mother
as
innocent
of
cajoling
as
i
am
and
that
saying
something
and
as
for
your
being
destitute
sweethearts
have
fifty
thousand
pounds
apiece
if
you
a
farthing
i
know
all
about
the
property
and
so
does
sir
gilbert
too
only
the
old
tiger
pretends
to
believe
just
to
feed
his
rage
that
your
mother
will
marry
her
footman
and
bequeath
her
money
to
all
the
little
footboys
and
girls
that
may
ensue
for
one
principal
cause
of
his
vengeance
against
your
poor
mother
is
that
she
is
still
young
enough
to
have
children
was
there
ever
such
a
man
but
here
have
i
according
to
custom
scribbled
my
paper
as
full
as
it
will
hold
and
yet
have
got
a
hundred
thousand
more
things
to
say
but
it
would
all
come
to
this
if
i
were
to
scrawl
over
a
ream
i
am
miserable
because
i
ca
come
to
see
your
mother
and
you
and
yet
i
ca
help
myself
any
more
than
if
i
were
shut
up
in
bridewell
for
i
never
did
do
any
thing
that
my
abominable
old
husband
desired
me
not
to
do
and
i
do
think
i
could
do
it
even
to
please
you
my
pretty
helen
only
do
fancy
i
have
forgotten
you
but
for
god
sake
write
to
me
i
am
quite
sure
i
should
get
my
ears
boxed
believe
me
darling
child
your
loving
friend
and
godmother
jane
matilda
harrington
i
am
quite
sure
that
the
colonel
would
send
pretty
messages
if
he
knew
what
i
was
about
but
i
will
not
make
him
a
party
in
my
sin
i
was
just
going
to
tell
him
this
morning
but
my
conscience
smote
me
and
i
turned
very
sublimely
away
muttering
in
the
words
of
macbeth
innocent
of
this
my
dearest
chuck
this
coarse
but
letter
gave
inexpressible
pain
to
helen
she
dared
not
show
it
to
her
mother
who
she
felt
quite
sure
would
consider
the
unjust
suspicions
of
sir
gilbert
as
the
most
cruel
insult
not
could
she
after
lady
harrington
prohibition
attempt
to
answer
it
though
she
greatly
wished
to
do
it
in
the
hope
that
she
might
be
able
to
place
her
mother
conduct
and
feelings
in
a
proper
light
but
she
well
knew
that
with
all
her
friend
rhodomontade
she
was
most
devotedly
attached
to
her
excellent
though
husband
and
that
she
could
not
disoblige
her
more
than
by
betraying
a
secret
which
under
the
present
circumstances
would
certainly
make
him
very
angry
but
the
sight
of
her
mother
tears
and
her
utter
inability
to
say
any
thing
that
might
console
her
very
just
sorrow
inspired
helen
with
a
bold
device
to
rosalind
only
had
she
shown
lady
harrington
letter
and
to
rosalind
only
did
she
communicate
her
project
of
boldly
writing
to
the
enraged
baronet
himself
do
so
helen
said
rosalind
promptly
it
is
the
only
measure
to
pursue
unless
indeed
you
and
i
were
to
set
off
and
surprise
him
by
a
visit
but
my
mother
replied
helen
evidently
struck
by
the
advantages
of
this
bolder
scheme
over
her
own
what
would
my
mother
say
to
our
going
if
she
knew
of
it
helen
i
suspect
it
would
lose
all
favour
in
sir
gilbert
eyes
and
you
would
have
no
chance
whatever
of
softening
his
rage
towards
her
the
expedition
if
undertaken
at
all
must
be
a
secret
one
when
he
learns
it
is
so
i
think
it
will
touch
his
tough
heart
helen
for
he
knows
i
fancy
that
such
escapades
are
not
at
all
in
your
line
i
only
hope
that
he
will
not
find
out
that
i
proposed
it
as
that
might
lessen
your
merit
in
his
eyes
no
no
that
would
do
no
harm
my
doing
it
would
be
quite
proof
enough
how
near
this
matter
is
to
my
heart
well
then
helen
shall
we
go
let
me
sleep
upon
it
rosalind
if
we
do
go
it
must
i
think
be
quite
early
in
the
morning
so
as
to
have
no
questions
asked
before
we
set
out
it
is
not
a
long
walk
shall
we
see
if
he
will
give
us
some
breakfast
a
most
diplomatic
project
replied
rosalind
for
it
will
enlist
his
hospitality
on
our
side
and
ten
to
one
but
the
rough
coating
of
his
heart
will
thaw
and
resolve
itself
into
a
dew
as
fanny
would
say
by
the
mere
act
of
administering
coffee
and
hot
cakes
to
us
and
then
the
field
is
won
i
think
we
will
try
said
helen
smiling
with
a
sort
of
inward
strengthening
from
the
conviction
that
such
would
very
probably
be
the
result
a
few
more
words
settled
the
exact
time
and
manner
of
the
expedition
and
the
friends
parted
to
dress
for
dinner
chapter
viii
richards
and
her
the
on
the
evening
of
that
day
the
three
girls
for
the
first
time
induced
mowbray
to
go
beyond
the
limits
of
the
and
walk
under
the
avenue
of
beautiful
elms
in
the
park
the
simple
and
unostentatious
tone
of
her
character
had
influenced
all
her
habits
and
mowbray
was
a
better
and
more
constant
walker
than
ladies
generally
who
have
two
or
three
carriages
ready
to
attend
them
she
appeared
to
enjoy
the
exercise
from
which
for
several
weeks
she
had
been
debarred
and
when
the
end
of
the
avenue
was
reached
and
fanny
almost
mechanically
opened
the
wide
gate
at
the
bottom
of
it
her
mother
passed
through
it
without
making
any
observation
and
in
truth
forgetting
at
that
moment
all
that
had
happened
since
she
had
last
done
so
the
gate
opened
upon
a
road
which
according
to
custom
they
crossed
nearly
at
right
angles
and
then
mounted
and
descended
half
a
dozen
steps
which
conducted
them
into
a
wide
and
beautiful
meadow
now
fragrant
with
the
hay
that
several
waggons
were
conveying
to
augment
a
lofty
rick
in
a
distant
corner
of
it
it
was
not
till
mowbray
perceived
another
party
seated
round
the
base
of
a
haycock
which
an
empty
waggon
had
nearly
reached
that
she
remembered
all
the
circumstances
which
made
every
casual
meeting
a
matter
of
importance
and
agitation
to
her
the
group
which
seemed
a
very
merry
one
retained
their
places
till
two
stout
haymakers
saucily
but
playfully
presented
their
as
if
to
dislodge
them
they
then
started
to
their
feet
to
the
number
of
five
and
the
park
family
recognized
richards
her
three
daughters
and
major
dalrymple
i
have
not
seen
them
yet
helen
said
mowbray
with
nervous
trepidation
how
very
wrong
i
have
been
to
come
so
far
why
so
my
dearest
mother
replied
helen
i
am
sure
it
is
less
painful
to
meet
thus
than
at
those
dreadful
visits
in
the
but
they
have
not
called
helen
certainly
we
had
better
go
back
dear
mamma
it
is
not
possible
said
fanny
stepping
forward
to
meet
a
favourite
companion
in
the
youngest
miss
richards
you
see
rosalind
has
got
to
them
already
it
was
indeed
too
late
to
retreat
nor
did
the
wish
to
do
so
last
long
richards
pressed
the
hand
of
rosalind
who
had
taken
hers
but
throwing
it
off
at
the
same
moment
hastened
forward
to
greet
the
widowed
friend
she
had
wanted
courage
to
seek
her
colour
was
heightened
perhaps
from
feeling
it
possible
that
the
cause
of
her
absence
had
been
mistaken
but
large
tears
trembled
in
her
dark
eyes
and
when
she
silently
took
the
hand
of
mowbray
and
pressed
it
to
her
lips
every
doubt
upon
the
subject
was
removed
major
dalrymple
and
the
three
girls
followed
and
the
first
moment
of
meeting
over
the
two
parties
seemed
mutually
and
equally
pleased
to
join
richards
was
the
only
person
in
the
neighbourhood
to
whom
rosalind
during
her
six
months
residence
in
it
had
at
all
attached
herself
there
was
something
about
her
that
had
fascinated
the
young
heiress
fancy
and
the
circumstance
of
her
being
the
only
good
second
in
a
duet
to
be
found
within
the
circle
of
the
mowbray
park
visitings
had
completed
the
charm
with
the
two
eldest
misses
richards
helen
was
on
that
sort
of
intimate
footing
which
a
very
unpretending
girl
of
nineteen
who
knows
she
is
of
some
consequence
from
her
station
and
is
terribly
afraid
of
being
supposed
to
be
proud
is
sure
to
be
with
young
ladies
of
nearly
her
own
age
blessed
with
most
exuberant
animal
spirits
and
desirous
of
making
themselves
as
agreeable
to
her
as
possible
louisa
and
charlotte
richards
were
fine
tall
showy
young
women
with
some
aspirations
after
the
reputation
of
talent
but
they
were
neither
of
them
at
all
like
their
mother
who
was
at
least
six
inches
shorter
than
either
of
them
and
aspired
to
nothing
in
the
world
but
to
make
her
three
children
happy
little
mary
as
her
sisters
still
persisted
to
call
her
approached
much
nearer
to
the
stature
person
and
character
of
richards
she
was
not
quite
so
in
size
but
she
had
her
features
wore
her
eye
perhaps
some
feeling
of
her
heart
and
was
spite
of
all
the
struggles
which
her
mother
could
make
to
prevent
it
the
darling
of
her
eyes
and
the
hope
of
her
heart
moreover
little
mary
was
as
we
have
before
hinted
the
especial
friend
of
fanny
mowbray
the
delights
of
a
balmy
evening
in
the
flowery
month
of
june
the
superadded
delights
of
a
and
above
all
the
supreme
delight
of
unexpectedly
meeting
a
party
of
friends
were
all
enthusiastically
descanted
upon
by
the
two
tall
misses
richards
they
had
each
taken
one
of
helen
slight
arms
and
borne
her
along
over
the
stubble
grass
with
a
degree
of
vehemence
which
hardly
left
her
breath
to
speak
i
do
not
think
mamma
is
going
any
farther
she
continued
to
utter
while
miss
louisa
stopped
to
tie
a
oh
but
you
must
screamed
miss
charlotte
attempting
to
drag
her
onward
singly
stop
charlotte
stop
cried
the
eldest
sister
snapping
off
the
in
her
haste
you
shall
not
carry
her
away
from
me
what
a
shame
is
it
a
shame
when
it
is
such
an
age
since
we
met
there
is
nothing
against
which
it
is
so
difficult
to
rally
as
the
exaggerated
expression
of
feelings
in
which
we
do
not
share
the
quiet
helen
could
not
lash
herself
into
answering
vehemence
of
joy
and
having
smiled
and
smiled
till
she
was
weary
she
fairly
slipped
from
her
companions
and
hastened
back
with
all
the
speed
she
could
make
to
the
tranquil
party
that
surrounded
her
mother
the
lively
young
ladies
galloped
after
her
declaring
all
the
way
that
she
was
the
cruellest
creature
in
the
world
mowbray
now
said
that
she
hoped
they
would
all
accompany
her
home
to
tea
a
proposal
that
met
no
dissenting
voice
but
it
was
some
time
before
the
whole
party
could
be
collected
for
fanny
mowbray
and
little
mary
were
nowhere
to
be
seen
major
dalrymple
however
who
was
taller
even
than
the
misses
richards
by
means
of
standing
upon
the
last
left
haycock
at
length
discovered
them
sitting
lovingly
side
by
side
under
the
shelter
of
a
huge
that
filled
one
corner
of
the
field
he
was
dismissed
to
bring
them
up
to
the
main
body
and
executed
his
commission
with
great
gallantry
and
but
not
without
feeling
that
the
two
very
pretty
girls
he
thus
led
away
captive
would
much
rather
have
been
without
him
for
as
he
approached
their
lair
he
perceived
not
only
that
they
were
in
very
earnest
conversation
but
that
various
scraps
of
written
paper
lay
in
the
lap
of
each
which
at
his
approach
were
hastily
exchanged
and
conveyed
to
reticules
pockets
or
bosoms
beyond
the
reach
of
his
eye
they
nevertheless
smilingly
submitted
themselves
to
his
guidance
and
in
order
to
prove
that
he
was
not
very
troublesome
fanny
so
far
returned
to
their
previous
conversation
as
to
say
we
must
ask
your
judgment
major
dalrymple
upon
a
point
on
which
we
were
disputing
just
before
you
joined
us
which
do
you
prefer
in
the
pulpit
and
out
of
it
wallace
or
mr
cartwright
you
were
disputing
the
point
were
you
he
replied
then
i
am
afraid
miss
fanny
i
must
give
it
against
you
for
i
believe
i
know
opinion
already
and
i
perfectly
agree
with
her
then
i
shall
say
to
you
as
i
say
to
her
replied
fanny
eagerly
that
you
are
altogether
blinded
benighted
deluded
and
wrapt
up
in
prejudice
i
have
great
faith
both
in
her
sincerity
and
yours
major
and
yet
i
declare
to
you
that
it
does
seem
to
me
so
impossible
for
any
one
to
doubt
the
superiority
of
cartwright
in
every
way
that
i
can
hardly
persuade
myself
you
are
in
earnest
what
do
you
mean
by
miss
fanny
you
can
not
surely
believe
him
to
be
a
better
man
than
our
dear
old
vicar
said
the
major
we
can
none
of
us
i
think
have
any
right
to
make
comparisons
of
their
respective
goodness
at
least
not
as
yet
replied
fanny
when
i
said
i
meant
in
the
church
and
in
society
on
the
latter
point
i
suppose
i
ought
to
leave
the
question
to
be
decided
between
you
as
in
all
cases
of
the
kind
where
gentlemen
are
to
be
tried
ladies
alone
i
believe
are
considered
competent
to
form
the
jury
not
that
mary
can
have
much
right
to
pronounce
a
verdict
either
for
i
doubt
if
she
has
ever
been
in
a
room
with
cartwright
in
her
life
yes
i
have
said
mary
eagerly
and
he
is
perfectly
delightful
indeed
i
did
not
know
you
had
seen
him
yes
we
met
him
at
smith
oh
you
saw
him
in
a
shop
did
you
and
even
that
was
sufficient
to
prove
him
delightful
quite
enough
replied
mary
colouring
a
little
as
she
observed
major
dalrymple
smile
the
more
you
see
of
him
the
more
you
will
be
aware
of
his
excellence
said
fanny
coming
to
the
aid
of
her
friend
and
with
an
air
of
gravity
that
was
intended
to
check
the
levity
of
the
major
i
have
seen
him
repeatedly
at
the
park
major
dalrymple
and
under
circumstances
that
gave
sufficient
opportunity
to
show
the
excellence
of
his
heart
as
well
as
the
charm
of
his
friendly
affectionate
and
graceful
manner
he
has
certainly
been
a
very
handsome
man
said
the
major
has
been
exclaimed
both
the
girls
at
once
he
is
still
very
added
the
gentleman
was
again
indignantly
echoed
by
the
ladies
you
do
not
think
the
term
strong
enough
but
when
a
man
gets
on
the
wrong
side
of
forty
it
is
i
think
as
much
as
he
can
expect
i
do
care
a
farthing
what
his
age
maybe
cried
mary
do
you
miss
mowbray
if
he
were
a
hundred
and
forty
with
that
countenance
and
that
manner
i
should
still
think
him
the
handsomest
and
most
perfect
person
i
ever
saw
dear
mary
replied
fanny
affectionately
how
exactly
we
feel
alike
about
him
i
love
you
dearly
for
fighting
his
battles
so
warmly
there
is
surely
no
fighting
in
the
case
said
major
dalrymple
laughing
at
least
not
with
me
but
have
a
care
young
ladies
such
perfect
conformity
of
taste
on
these
subjects
does
not
always
i
believe
tend
to
the
continuance
of
female
friendship
what
a
sad
thing
it
would
be
if
those
two
little
hands
were
some
day
to
set
pulling
caps
between
their
respective
owners
there
is
not
the
least
danger
of
any
such
dismal
catastrophe
i
assure
you
is
there
mary
good
heavens
no
replied
little
mary
in
a
voice
of
great
indignation
what
a
hateful
idea
one
reason
why
it
is
so
delightful
to
love
and
admire
cartwright
rejoined
fanny
is
that
one
may
do
it
and
talk
of
it
too
without
any
danger
that
major
dalrymple
should
make
a
jest
of
it
and
talk
the
same
sort
of
nonsense
that
every
body
is
so
fond
of
doing
whenever
a
lady
is
heard
to
express
admiration
for
a
gentleman
but
we
may
surely
love
and
admire
the
clergyman
of
the
parish
indeed
i
think
it
is
a
sort
of
duty
for
every
one
to
do
so
i
assure
you
replied
the
major
that
i
both
loved
and
admired
wallace
exceedingly
and
that
i
shall
gladly
pay
the
same
homage
to
his
successor
as
soon
as
i
know
him
to
deserve
it
but
cautious
age
and
youth
you
know
the
song
mary
i
know
your
meaning
major
dalrymple
you
are
always
boasting
of
your
age
but
i
do
know
any
one
but
yourself
who
thinks
so
very
much
of
my
antiquity
and
my
wisdom
just
that
but
good
heavens
fanny
mowbray
who
is
that
to
whom
your
mother
is
speaking
on
the
lawn
it
is
mr
cartwright
cried
fanny
with
animation
and
now
major
dalrymple
you
will
have
an
opportunity
of
judging
for
yourself
i
fear
not
he
replied
taking
out
his
watch
it
is
now
eight
and
richards
seldom
walks
much
after
nine
the
two
girls
now
withdrew
their
arms
and
hastened
forward
to
the
group
of
which
cartwright
made
one
fanny
mowbray
held
out
her
hand
to
him
which
was
taken
and
held
very
affectionately
for
two
or
three
minutes
you
have
been
enjoying
this
balmy
air
said
he
to
her
in
a
voice
sweetly
modulated
to
the
hour
and
the
theme
it
is
heaven
own
breath
miss
fanny
and
to
such
a
mind
as
yours
must
utter
accents
worthy
of
the
source
from
whence
it
comes
fanny
beautiful
eyes
were
fixed
upon
his
face
and
almost
seemed
to
say
when
you
speak
i
have
you
do
it
ever
i
do
not
think
he
recollects
me
whispered
mary
richards
in
her
ear
i
wish
you
introduce
me
fanny
mowbray
started
but
recovering
herself
said
cartwright
give
me
leave
to
introduce
my
friend
miss
mary
richards
to
you
she
is
one
of
your
parishioners
and
one
that
you
will
find
capable
of
appreciating
the
happiness
of
being
so
cartwright
extended
his
pastoral
hand
to
the
young
lady
with
a
most
gracious
smile
bless
you
both
said
he
joining
their
hands
between
both
of
his
to
lead
you
together
in
the
path
in
which
we
must
all
wish
to
go
would
be
a
task
that
might
give
a
foretaste
of
the
heaven
we
sought
he
then
turned
towards
mowbray
and
with
a
look
and
tone
which
showed
that
though
he
never
alluded
to
her
situation
he
never
forgot
it
he
inquired
how
far
she
had
extended
her
ramble
much
farther
than
i
intended
when
i
set
out
replied
mowbray
but
my
children
the
weather
and
the
hay
altogether
beguiled
me
to
the
bottom
of
farmer
bennet
great
meadow
quite
right
quite
right
replied
cartwright
with
something
approaching
almost
to
fervour
of
approbation
this
species
of
quiet
courage
of
gentle
submission
is
just
what
i
expected
from
mowbray
it
is
the
sweetest
incense
that
you
can
offer
to
heaven
and
heaven
will
repay
it
mowbray
looked
up
at
his
mild
countenance
and
saw
a
moisture
in
his
eye
that
spoke
more
tender
pity
than
he
would
permit
his
lips
to
utter
it
touched
her
to
the
heart
richards
who
was
something
of
a
florist
was
examining
with
the
assistance
of
rosalind
some
new
geraniums
that
were
placed
on
circular
stands
outside
the
filling
the
spaces
between
the
windows
as
this
occupation
had
drawn
them
from
the
rest
of
the
party
from
the
time
cartwright
approached
to
join
it
they
had
not
yet
received
that
gentleman
salutation
and
he
now
went
up
to
them
miss
torrington
looks
as
if
she
were
discoursing
of
her
kindred
are
these
fair
blossoms
the
children
of
your
especial
care
they
are
the
children
of
the
gardener
and
the
greenhouse
i
believe
she
replied
carelessly
and
stepped
on
to
another
stand
richards
i
believe
said
the
graceful
vicar
taking
off
his
hat
to
her
i
hope
you
are
well
mr
cartwright
replied
the
lady
following
the
steps
of
rosalind
the
two
eldest
misses
richards
were
still
assiduously
besieging
the
two
ears
of
helen
but
as
the
subjects
of
which
they
discoursed
did
not
always
require
the
same
answers
she
began
to
feel
considerable
fatigue
from
the
exertion
necessary
for
carrying
on
this
double
conversation
and
was
therefore
not
sorry
to
see
cartwright
approach
them
which
must
she
thought
produce
a
diversion
in
her
favour
but
she
found
that
the
parties
were
still
personally
strangers
to
each
other
for
though
his
bow
was
general
his
address
was
only
to
herself
and
have
you
too
miss
mowbray
been
venturing
upon
as
long
a
walk
as
the
rest
of
the
party
we
have
all
walked
the
same
distance
cartwright
but
i
believe
we
none
of
us
consider
it
to
be
very
far
we
are
all
good
walkers
i
rejoice
to
hear
it
for
it
is
the
way
to
become
good
christians
where
or
how
can
we
meet
and
examine
the
works
of
the
great
creator
so
well
as
on
the
carpet
he
has
spread
and
beneath
the
azure
canopy
which
his
hands
have
reared
above
us
the
misses
richards
i
believe
may
i
beg
an
introduction
miss
mowbray
cartwright
miss
richards
miss
charlotte
richards
said
helen
without
adding
another
word
i
need
hardly
ask
if
you
are
walkers
said
the
vicar
as
he
passed
a
smiling
and
apparently
an
approving
glance
over
their
rather
remarkable
length
of
limb
your
friends
miss
mowbray
look
like
young
antelopes
ready
to
bound
over
the
fair
face
of
nature
and
their
eyes
look
as
if
there
were
intelligence
within
wherewith
to
read
her
aright
mamma
is
going
into
tea
i
believe
said
helen
moving
off
the
whole
manner
and
demeanour
of
the
two
misses
richards
had
changed
from
the
moment
cartwright
approached
they
became
quite
silent
and
demure
but
as
they
followed
helen
one
on
each
side
of
him
they
coloured
with
pleasure
as
he
addressed
a
gentle
word
first
to
one
then
to
the
other
and
when
after
entering
the
he
left
them
for
the
purpose
of
making
his
farewell
bow
or
the
semblance
of
it
to
mowbray
miss
louisa
whispered
to
miss
charlotte
little
mary
is
quite
right
he
the
most
delightful
man
in
the
world
you
are
not
going
to
leave
us
mr
cartwright
said
mowbray
kindly
we
are
going
to
tea
this
moment
you
are
very
obliging
but
i
had
no
intention
of
intruding
on
you
thus
pray
do
not
call
it
an
intrusion
we
shall
be
always
most
happy
to
see
you
i
only
wish
your
son
and
daughter
were
with
us
also
my
daughter
thank
you
is
a
sad
invalid
and
jacob
generally
wanders
farther
afield
in
such
weather
as
this
is
that
gentleman
major
dalrymple
may
i
ask
you
to
introduce
me
i
shall
have
much
pleasure
in
doing
so
i
am
sure
he
is
a
very
amiable
and
estimable
person

the
room
towards
him
followed
by
the
vicar
the
introduction
took
place
and
the
two
gentlemen
conversed
together
for
a
few
minutes
on
the
ordinary
topics
of
russia
the
harvest
the
and
reform
on
every
subject
except
the
harvest
which
cartwright
despatched
by
declaring
that
it
would
be
peculiarly
abundant
the
reverend
gentleman
expressed
himself
with
an
unusual
flow
of
words
in
sentences
particularly
well
constructed
yet
nevertheless
his
opinions
seemed
enveloped
in
a
mist
and
when
richards
afterwards
asked
the
major
his
opinion
of
the
new
vicar
he
replied
that
he
thought
his
manners
very
gentlemanlike
and
agreeable
but
that
he
did
not
perfectly
remember
what
opinions
he
had
expressed
on
any
subject
at
first
the
company
seemed
inclined
to
disperse
themselves
in
knots
about
the
room
but
by
degrees
cartwright
very
skilfully
contrived
on
one
pretence
or
another
to
collect
them
all
round
a
table
that
was
covered
with
the
usual
incitements
to
talk
and
the
conversation
became
general
at
least
cartwright
was
very
generally
listened
to
the
major
did
not
speak
at
all
and
the
ladies
did
little
more
than
agree
with
and
applaud
from
time
to
time
the
placid
even
dulcet
flow
of
words
which
fell
like
a
gentle
rivulet
from
the
lips
of
their
new
vicar
this
description
indeed
would
not
apply
quite
generally
to
all
the
ladies
but
the
majority
in
his
favour
was
five
to
three
and
with
this
advantage
that
whereas
his
admirers
were
loud
and
eloquent
in
their
expressions
of
approval
the
minority
contented
themselves
by
preserving
silence
chapter
ix
helen
and
rosalind
call
upon
sir
gilbert
harrington
helen
mowbray
knew
that
the
choleric
friend
whose
gentler
feelings
she
wished
to
propitiate
was
an
early
riser
himself
and
was
never
better
disposed
to
be
well
pleased
with
others
than
when
they
showed
themselves
capable
of
following
his
example
she
was
therefore
anxious
to
arrive
at
his
house
in
time
to
have
the
conversation
she
sought
yet
dreaded
before
nine
the
usual
family
though
in
the
sir
gilbert
generally
contrived
to
coax
my
lady
and
her
housekeeper
to
have
hot
rolls
smoking
on
the
table
by
eight
but
luckily
for
the
young
ladies
morning
repose
it
was
not
and
they
calculated
that
if
they
started
about
half
past
seven
they
should
have
time
for
their
walk
and
a
reasonably
long
conversation
afterwards
before
the
breakfast
to
which
they
looked
as
the
pacific
conclusion
of
the
negotiation
should
be
ready
at
half
past
seven
accordingly
the
fair
friends
met
at
the
door
of
rosalind
and
set
off
fearless
though
unattended
through
the
shrubberies
the
park
the
flowery
lanes
and
finally
across
one
or
two
which
separated
the
two
mansions
nothing
can
be
better
calculated
to
raise
the
animal
spirits
than
an
early
walk
in
the
gay
month
of
june
and
on
those
not
accustomed
to
the
elasticity
the
freshness
the
exhilarating
clearness
of
the
morning
air
the
effect
is
like
enchantment
all
the
sad
thoughts
which
had
of
late
so
constantly
brooded
round
helen
heart
seemed
to
withdraw
their
painful
pressure
and
she
again
felt
conscious
of
the
luxury
of
life
with
youth
health
and
innocence
a
clear
sky
bright
verdure
flowery
banks
and
shady
to
adorn
it
rosalind
by
an
irresistible
impulse
of
gaiety
joined
her
voice
to
those
of
the
blackbirds
that
carolled
near
her
till
she
was
stopped
by
helen
exclaiming
rosalind
i
feel
courage
for
anything
this
morning
yes
answered
her
companion
let
sir
gilbert
appear
in
any
shape
but
that
of
the
vicar
of
wrexhill
and
i
should
great
him
with
a
degree
of
confidence
and
kindness
that
i
am
positive
would
be
irresistible
they
were
now
within
a
short
distance
of
the
baronet
grounds
and
another
step
brought
their
courage
to
the
proof
for
on
mounting
a
which
had
originally
been
placed
for
the
especial
accommodation
of
the
mowbray
ladies
they
perceived
the
redoubtable
sir
gilbert
at
the
distance
of
fifty
paces
in
the
act
of
removing
an
offending
with
his
spud
he
raised
his
eyes
and
recognising
his
young
visitors
stepped
eagerly
forward
to
meet
them
to
rosalind
however
though
usually
a
great
favourite
he
now
paid
not
the
slightest
attention
but
taking
helen
in
his
arms
kissing
her
on
both
cheeks
and
on
the
forehead
and
then
looking
her
in
the
face
very
much
as
if
he
were
going
to
weep
over
her
he
exclaimed
my
poor
poor
child
why
did
not
you
bring
poor
fanny
too
you
are
right
to
come
away
quite
right
my
dear
child
it
dreadful
to
live
in
dependence
upon
any
one
caprice
for
one
daily
bread
your
home
shall
be
here
helen
and
fanny
too
as
long
as
you
like
come
my
dear
take
my
arm
my
lady
will
dance
you
may
depend
upon
it
when
she
sees
you
for
we
have
had
dreadful
work
about
keeping
her
from
mowbray
i
just
as
soon
keep
a
wild
cat
in
order
as
your
godmother
helen
when
she
takes
a
fancy
but
you
know
my
dear
her
going
to
mowbray
was
a
thing
not
to
be
thought
of
you
are
a
good
girl
to
come
it
shows
that
you
see
the
matter
rightly
i
wish
fanny
were
here
too
all
this
was
said
with
great
rapidity
and
without
pausing
for
any
answer
meanwhile
he
had
drawn
helen
arm
within
his
and
was
leading
her
towards
the
house
rosalind
followed
them
quietly
for
a
few
steps
and
then
either
moved
thereto
by
the
feeling
of
courage
her
walk
had
inspired
or
from
some
latent
consciousness
of
the
baronet
partiality
to
herself
she
boldly
stepped
up
and
took
his
arm
on
the
other
side
bless
my
soul
miss
torrington
by
the
honour
of
a
knight
i
never
saw
you
nor
do
i
think
i
should
have
seen
a
regiment
of
young
ladies
though
they
had
been
all
as
handsome
as
yourself
if
they
had
happened
to
come
with
my
poor
dear
helen
it
was
very
good
of
you
to
walk
over
with
her
poor
little
thing
your
fortune
is
quite
safe
and
independent
my
dear
is
it
nobody
doing
a
foolish
thing
can
involve
you
in
any
way
can
it
not
unless
the
foolish
thing
happened
to
be
done
by
myself
sir
gilbert
that
a
great
blessing
my
dear
a
very
great
blessing
and
be
kind
to
our
two
poor
girls
wo
you
my
dear
i
have
more
need
that
they
should
be
kind
to
me
and
so
they
are
and
we
are
all
very
kind
to
one
another
and
if
you
will
be
but
very
kind
too
and
come
and
see
us
all
as
you
used
to
do
we
shall
be
very
happy
again
in
time
stuff
and
nonsense
child
you
may
come
here
i
tell
you
and
see
me
as
much
as
you
like
under
my
own
roof
because
i
know
who
that
belongs
to
and
all
about
it
but
i
promise
you
that
you
will
never
see
me
going
to
houses
that
do
belong
to
their
right
owner
it
would
not
suit
me
in
the
least
quite
out
of
my
way
i
should
be
making
some
confounded
blunder
and
talking
to
poor
charles
about
his
estate
and
his
property
poor
fellow
and
he
not
worth
sixpence
in
the
world
during
all
this
time
helen
had
not
spoken
a
word
they
had
now
nearly
reached
the
house
and
drawing
her
arm
away
she
held
out
her
hand
to
sir
gilbert
and
said
in
a
very
humble
and
beseeching
tone
sir
gilbert
may
i
speak
to
you
alone
for
a
few
minutes
speak
to
me
child
what
about
is
it
about
a
is
it
about
wanting
my
poor
child
i
executor
to
your
will
you
know
helen
and
if
you
were
starving
in
a
ditch
and
fanny
in
another
and
poor
charles
begging
his
bread
on
the
high
road
i
have
not
the
power
of
giving
either
of
ye
a
shilling
of
his
property
though
he
has
left
above
fourteen
thousand
a
year
sir
gilbert
was
now
lashing
himself
into
a
rage
that
it
was
evident
would
render
the
object
of
helen
visit
abortive
if
she
attempted
to
bring
it
forward
now
she
exchanged
a
glance
with
rosalind
who
shook
her
head
and
the
next
moment
contrived
to
whisper
in
her
ear
wait
till
after
breakfast
sir
gilbert
was
now
striding
up
the
steps
to
the
the
two
girls
silently
followed
him
and
were
probably
neither
of
them
sorry
to
see
colonel
harrington
coming
forward
to
meet
them
this
young
man
had
for
the
two
or
three
last
years
seen
but
little
of
the
mowbray
family
having
been
abroad
during
nearly
the
whole
of
that
time
but
he
returned
with
something
very
like
a
tender
recollection
of
helen
having
been
the
prettiest
little
nymph
at
fifteen
that
he
had
ever
beheld
and
her
appearance
at
this
moment
was
not
calculated
to
make
him
think
she
had
lost
her
delicate
beauty
during
his
absence
her
slight
tall
figure
was
shown
to
great
advantage
by
her
mourning
dress
and
the
fair
and
abundant
curls
that
crowded
round
her
face
now
a
little
flushed
by
exercise
and
agitation
made
her
altogether
as
pretty
a
creature
in
her
peculiar
style
as
a
young
soldier
would
wish
to
look
upon
the
hair
and
sparkling
dark
eyes
of
rosalind
her
ruby
lips
and
teeth
her
exquisite
little
figure
and
the
general
air
of
piquant
vivacity
which
made
her
perfectly
radiant
when
animated
rendered
her
in
most
eyes
the
more
attractive
of
the
two
but
colonel
harrington
did
not
think
so
and
giving
her
one
glance
of
curiosity
for
he
had
never
seen
her
before
he
decided
that
neither
she
nor
any
other
woman
he
had
ever
beheld
could
compare
in
loveliness
with
his
former
friend
and
favourite
his
greeting
to
helen
was
just
what
might
be
expected
from
a
man
who
had
known
her
with
great
intimacy
when
she
was
some
inches
shorter
and
who
felt
the
strongest
possible
desire
to
renew
the
acquaintance
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
helen
mowbray
he
exclaimed
springing
forward
and
seizing
her
hand
how
delighted
i
am
to
see
you
how
is
dear
little
fanny
how
is
charles
i
trust
you
have
none
of
you
forgotten
me
helen
blushed
deeply
at
the
unexpected
ardour
of
this
address
from
a
very
tall
handsome
personage
whose
face
she
certainly
would
not
have
recognised
had
she
met
him
accidentally
but
a
happy
smile
accompanied
the
blush
and
he
had
no
reason
to
regret
the
politic
freedom
of
his
first
salutation
which
had
thus
enabled
him
to
pass
over
an
infinity
of
gradations
towards
the
intimacy
he
coveted
at
one
single
step
placing
him
at
once
on
the
footing
of
a
familiar
friend
it
was
indeed
nearly
impossible
that
helen
could
be
offended
by
the
freedom
for
not
only
was
it
sanctioned
by
the
union
of
their
two
families
but
at
this
moment
she
could
not
but
be
pleased
at
finding
another
dear
old
friend
in
the
garrison
who
would
be
sure
to
add
his
influence
to
that
of
her
godmother
that
what
she
so
greatly
wished
to
obtain
should
not
be
refused
before
they
reached
the
therefore
the
most
perfect
understanding
was
established
between
them
her
friend
miss
torrington
was
gaily
introduced
for
her
heart
felt
gladdened
by
this
important
addition
to
her
supporters
in
the
cause
she
had
undertaken
and
she
was
disposed
to
believe
that
rosalind
proposal
to
make
this
alarming
visit
would
turn
out
to
have
been
one
of
the
most
fortunate
things
that
ever
happened
within
the
and
approachable
by
no
other
access
was
a
small
room
known
throughout
the
mansion
and
indeed
throughout
the
neighbourhood
also
as
my
lady
closet
this
sacred
retreat
was
an
oblong
room
about
eighteen
feet
by
eight
a
large
and
lofty
window
occupied
nearly
one
end
of
it
across
which
was
placed
a
or
table
of
three
feet
wide
filling
the
entire
space
between
the
walls
the
whole
room
was
lined
with
shelves
and
drawers
the
former
of
which
were
for
the
most
part
sheltered
by
heavy
crimson
damask
curtains
a
few
small
tables
stood
scattered
here
and
there
and
the
sole
accommodation
for
sitting
consisted
of
one
high
stool
such
as
laundresses
use
when
ironing
to
the
door
of
this
apartment
sir
gilbert
approached
and
there
reverently
stopped
for
by
the
law
of
the
land
even
he
though
a
pretty
extensively
privileged
personage
was
permitted
to
go
no
farther
unless
licensed
by
an
especial
warrant
from
its
mistress
my
lady
he
said
in
the
cheerful
lusty
voice
that
announces
agreeable
tidings
my
lady
i
have
brought
home
company
to
breakfast
have
you
sir
knight
replied
lady
harrington
without
turning
her
head
or
otherwise
interrupting
herself
in
the
performance
of
some
apparently
delicate
process
upon
which
she
was
occupied
i
rather
have
bluebeard
for
a
wife
than
such
an
incurious
old
soul
as
you
are
said
the
testy
and
so
you
have
not
even
the
grace
to
ask
who
it
is
why
my
dear
sir
tiger
i
shall
be
sure
to
know
within
two
minutes
after
tomkins
gives
his
passing
thump
to
announce
that
he
is
carrying
in
the
coffee
then
why
should
i
disturb
this
fairest
of
the
pentandria
class
my
charming
mirabilis
the
devil
take
you
and
all
your
classes
orders
and
tribes
to
his
own
hothouse
i
be
hanged
if
i
do
lock
you
into
your
den
while
i
breakfast
with
her
you
sha
see
her
at
all
mother
mother
exclaimed
the
colonel
hastily
to
anticipate
the
execution
of
the
threat
it
is
helen
mowbray
helen
mowbray
cried
the
old
lady
thrusting
her
hot
on
one
side
and
her
blossom
on
the
other
while
the
precious
mirabilis
fell
to
the
ground
helen
mowbray
and
pushing
aside
the
baronet
by
no
very
gentle
movement
of
her
tall
and
substantial
person
she
rushed
forward
and
helen
was
speedily
folded
in
a
very
close
embrace
there
there
there
do
stifle
the
girl
old
lady
and
supposing
you
were
to
bestow
one
little
monosyllable
of
civility
upon
this
pretty
creature
miss
torrington
who
stands
smiling
at
us
all
like
an
angel
though
every
soul
amongst
us
is
as
rude
as
a
bear
to
i
believe
you
ever
found
yourself
so
entirely
neglected
before
my
dear
i
have
never
witnessed
attention
more
gratifying
to
me
than
that
which
i
have
seen
displayed
this
morning
replied
rosalind
you
are
a
good
girl
a
very
good
girl
my
dear
and
i
shall
always
love
you
for
coming
over
with
this
poor
dear
disinherited
child
miss
torrington
i
am
delighted
to
see
you
now
and
ever
my
dear
young
lady
said
lady
harrington
who
when
she
chose
it
could
be
as
dignified
and
as
courteous
too
as
any
lady
in
the
land
you
have
walked
over
i
am
sure
by
the
bright
freshness
of
your
looks
now
then
sit
down
one
on
each
side
of
me
that
i
may
be
able
to
see
you
without
hoisting
a
across
this
prodigious
table
and
so
because
your
ladyship
is
said
sir
gilbert
william
and
i
are
to
sit
at
this
awful
distance
from
these
beautiful
damsels
you
are
a
tiresome
old
soul
as
ever
lived
and
that
the
reason
you
appear
so
profoundly
melancholy
and
miserable
at
this
moment
said
lady
harrington
looking
with
no
trifling
degree
of
satisfaction
at
the
radiant
and
happiness
which
the
unexpected
arrival
of
helen
had
caused
to
be
visible
in
the
countenance
of
her
boisterous
husband
do
you
find
william
much
altered
helen
she
continued
i
wonder
if
any
one
has
had
the
grace
to
present
colonel
harrington
to
miss
torrington
helen
did
me
that
kind
office
said
the
colonel
and
i
suppose
she
must
do
the
same
for
me
to
little
fanny
i
long
to
see
if
she
continues
as
surpassingly
beautiful
as
she
was
when
i
took
my
sad
reluctant
leave
of
mowbray
park
rosalind
immediately
became
answerable
for
the
undiminished
beauty
of
fanny
adding
to
her
report
on
this
point
a
declaration
that
the
whole
family
were
anxious
to
renew
their
acquaintance
with
him
this
was
the
nearest
approach
that
any
of
the
party
ventured
to
make
towards
the
mention
of
mowbray
park
or
its
inhabitants
nevertheless
the
breakfast
passed
cheerfully
and
even
without
a
word
from
sir
gilbert
in
allusion
to
the
destitute
condition
of
helen
and
her
brother
and
sister
but
when
even
the
baronet
had
disposed
of
his
last
pushed
the
ham
fairly
away
from
him
and
swallowed
his
last
bowl
of
tea
the
beautiful
colour
of
helen
began
gradually
to
deepen
she
ceased
to
speak
and
hardly
seemed
to
hear
what
was
said
to
her
rosalind
took
the
hint
and
with
more
tact
than
is
usually
found
in
the
possession
of
seventeen
and
a
half
she
said
to
lady
harrington
if
i
promise
to
keep
my
hands
not
only
from
picking
and
stealing
but
from
touching
will
your
ladyship
indulge
me
with
a
sight
of
your
press
and
your
boxes
and
a
volume
or
two
of
your
for
i
feel
considerable
aspirations
after
the
glory
of
becoming
a
botanist
myself
my
ladyship
will
show
you
something
infinitely
more
to
the
purpose
then
if
you
will
come
to
the
hothouse
with
me
replied
lady
harrington
rising
and
giving
an
intelligible
glance
to
her
son
as
she
did
so
which
immediately
caused
him
to
rise
and
follow
her
i
can
not
take
you
where
i
should
be
sure
to
overhear
them
my
dear
she
added
in
a
whisper
as
she
led
rosalind
from
the
room
for
if
my
rough
diamond
should
chance
to
be
too
rough
with
her
i
should
infallibly
burst
out
upon
them
and
yet
i
know
well
enough
that
i
should
do
nothing
but
mischief
helen
was
thus
left
alone
with
the
but
pertinacious
baronet
he
seemed
to
have
a
misgiving
of
the
attack
that
was
about
to
be
opened
upon
him
for
he
made
a
fidgetty
movement
in
his
chair
pushed
it
back
and
looked
so
very
much
inclined
to
run
away
that
helen
saw
no
time
was
to
be
lost
and
in
a
voice
not
said
i
want
to
speak
to
you
sir
gilbert
about
my
dear
mamma
i
fear
from
what
you
said
to
charles
and
more
still
by
nobody
coming
from
oakley
to
see
us
that
you
are
angry
with
if
it
is
about
the
will
sir
gilbert
you
do
her
great
injustice
i
am
very
very
sure
that
she
neither
wished
for
such
a
will
nor
knew
any
thing
about
it
it
is
very
pretty
and
dutiful
in
you
miss
helen
to
say
so
and
to
think
so
too
if
you
can
perhaps
i
might
have
done
the
same
at
nineteen
but
at
child
one
begins
to
know
a
little
better
what
signs
and
tokens
there
is
no
effect
without
a
cause
miss
helen
the
effect
in
this
affair
is
already
pretty
visible
to
all
eyes
and
will
speedily
become
more
so
you
may
depend
upon
it
the
cause
may
be
still
hid
from
babes
and
sucklings
but
not
from
an
old
fellow
like
me
who
knew
your
poor
father
girl
before
you
were
hatched
or
thought
of
and
knew
him
to
be
both
a
good
and
a
wise
man
who
would
never
have
done
the
deed
he
did
unless
under
the
influence
of
one
as
ever
near
and
ever
dear
to
him
as
your
mother
you
have
known
my
mother
too
sir
gilbert
for
many
many
years
did
you
ever
see
in
her
any
symptom
of
the
character
you
now
attribute
to
her
if
i
had
miss
helen
i
should
not
loathe
and
abominate
her
hypocrisy
as
i
now
do
i
will
never
see
her
more
for
all
our
sakes
for
if
i
did
i
know
right
well
that
i
could
not
restrain
my
indignation
within
moderate
bounds
then
certainly
it
would
be
better
that
you
should
not
see
her
said
the
weeping
helen
for
indeed
sir
i
think
such
unmerited
indignation
would
almost
kill
her
if
you
knew
any
thing
about
the
matter
child
you
would
be
aware
that
indignation
would
be
more
likely
to
disagree
with
her
unmerited
indignation
does
one
no
harm
in
the
world
as
i
can
testify
from
experience
for
my
lady
is
dreadfully
indignant
as
i
dare
say
you
guess
at
my
keeping
her
and
william
away
from
mowbray
park
and
ten
to
one
but
you
will
be
indignant
too
child
but
i
ca
help
it
i
love
you
all
three
very
much
helen
but
i
must
do
what
i
think
right
for
all
that
not
indignant
sir
gilbert
at
least
that
would
not
be
the
prevailing
feeling
with
me
though
a
sense
of
injustice
might
make
it
so
with
my
poor
mother
what
i
shall
feel
will
be
grief
unceasing
grief
if
the
friend
my
beloved
father
most
valued
and
esteemed
continues
to
refuse
his
countenance
and
affection
to
the
bereaved
family
he
has
left
from
the
time
this
conversation
began
sir
gilbert
had
been
striding
up
and
down
the
room
as
it
was
always
his
custom
to
do
when
he
felt
himself
in
a
rage
or
was
conscious
that
he
was
about
to
be
so
he
now
stopped
opposite
helen
and
while
something
very
like
tenderness
almost
impeded
his
utterance
he
said
that
trash
abominable
false
trash
miss
helen
after
what
passed
to
say
nothing
of
times
past
you
must
know
well
enough
that
not
likely
to
refuse
my
countenance
and
affection
to
your
children
bereaved
they
are
sure
enough
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
i
love
you
all
three
for
your
own
sakes
girl
as
well
as
for
his
and
your
pretending
to
doubt
it
was
a
hit
of
trumpery
womanhood
helen
so
never
make
use
of
it
again
for
you
see
i
understand
the
sex
and
that
just
the
reason
why
i
like
my
old
woman
better
than
any
other
in
the
wide
world
she
never
tries
any
tricks
upon
me
believe
me
sir
gilbert
said
helen
smiling
i
hate
tricks
as
much
as
my
godmother
can
and
if
it
were
otherwise
you
are
the
last
person
i
should
try
them
upon
but
how
can
we
think
you
love
us
if
you
will
not
come
near
mowbray
you
may
think
it
and
know
it
very
easily
child
by
the
welcome
you
shall
always
find
here
it
is
very
likely
that
you
may
not
be
long
comfortable
at
home
and
before
it
happens
remember
i
have
told
you
that
you
shall
always
have
a
home
at
oakley
but
it
must
not
be
on
condition
of
bringing
your
mother
with
you
for
see
her
i
will
not
and
there
an
end
helen
remained
silent
she
felt
painfully
convinced
that
at
least
for
the
present
she
should
gain
nothing
by
arguing
the
cause
of
her
mother
any
farther
and
after
a
long
pause
during
which
sir
gilbert
continued
to
pace
up
and
down
before
her
she
rose
and
sighing
deeply
said
i
believe
it
is
time
for
us
to
sir
gilbert
there
was
something
in
the
tone
of
her
voice
which
very
nearly
overset
all
the
sturdy
resolution
of
the
baronet
but
instead
of
yielding
to
the
weakness
as
he
would
have
called
it
like
a
skilful
general
he
marched
off
the
field
with
his
colours
still
flying
and
certainly
without
giving
his
adversary
any
reasonable
ground
to
hope
for
victory
they
are
all
in
the
hothouse
i
believe
said
he
walking
before
helen
to
a
door
of
the
hall
which
opened
upon
the
beautiful
gardens
you
have
not
seen
my
lady
heaths
for
many
a
day
helen
she
be
savage
if
you
go
without
taking
a
look
at
them
helen
followed
without
saying
a
word
in
reply
for
her
heart
was
full
and
when
she
joined
the
trio
who
had
so
considerately
left
her
to
the
uninterrupted
possession
of
sir
gilbert
ear
there
was
no
need
of
any
questioning
on
their
part
or
answering
on
hers
to
put
them
all
in
full
possession
of
the
result
of
the
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
which
of
the
three
looked
most
vexed
perhaps
lady
harrington
gave
the
strongest
outward
demonstrations
of
what
she
felt
on
the
occasion
she
glanced
frowningly
at
sir
gilbert
who
looked
as
if
he
intended
to
say
something
amiable
and
seizing
upon
helen
two
hands
kissed
them
both
exclaiming
dearest
and
best
what
a
heart
of
flint
must
that
being
have
who
could
find
the
cruel
strength
to
pain
thee
colonel
harrington
who
discomposed
and
disappointed
had
thrown
himself
on
a
bench
gave
his
mother
a
very
grateful
look
for
this
while
rosalind
after
examining
her
sad
countenance
for
a
moment
pressed
closely
to
her
friend
and
whispered
let
us
go
helen
poor
helen
had
no
inclination
to
delay
her
departure
and
knowing
that
her
partial
godmother
was
fully
capable
of
understanding
her
feelings
she
said
returning
her
carresses
do
not
keep
me
a
moment
longer
dearest
friend
for
fear
i
should
weep
and
then
i
am
sure
he
would
call
it
a
trick
i
will
not
keep
you
helen
replied
lady
harrington
aloud
you
have
come
on
a
mission
of
love
and
peace
and
if
i
mistake
not
that
heavy
eye
and
feverish
cheek
you
have
failed
poor
child
she
does
not
look
like
the
same
creature
that
she
did
an
hour
and
a
half
ago
does
she
william
adieu
lady
harrington
said
helen
the
big
tears
rolling
down
her
cheeks
despite
her
struggles
to
prevent
them
good
morning
colonel
harrington
farewell
sir
gilbert
this
is
hard
miss
torrington
said
the
baronet
turning
from
offered
hand
this
is
confounded
hard
i
doing
my
duty
and
acting
according
to
my
conscience
as
a
man
of
honour
and
yet
i
shall
be
made
to
believe
that
nero
was
a
dove
and
bluebeard
a
babe
of
grace
compared
to
me
but
miss
torrington
being
in
no
humour
to
answer
him
playfully
said
gravely
i
am
very
sorry
we
broke
in
upon
you
so
unadvisedly
sir
gilbert
it
is
plain
our
hopes
have
not
been
realised
the
young
lady
bowed
silently
to
the
colonel
and
taking
a
short
farewell
of
lady
harrington
but
one
in
which
mutual
kindness
was
mutually
understood
she
took
the
arm
of
her
discomfited
friend
and
they
proceeded
towards
a
little
gate
in
the
iron
fencing
which
divided
the
garden
from
the
paddock
in
front
of
the
house
and
you
wo
shake
hands
with
me
helen
said
sir
gilbert
following
do
not
say
so
sir
replied
helen
turning
back
and
holding
out
her
hand
and
when
shall
we
see
you
here
again
whenever
you
will
come
and
fetch
me
sir
gilbert
she
replied
endeavouring
to
look
cheerful
he
took
her
hand
wrung
it
and
turned
away
without
speaking
your
interdict
sir
said
colonel
harrington
does
not
i
hope
extend
beyond
mowbray
park
paling
i
trust
i
may
be
permitted
to
take
care
of
these
young
ladies
as
far
as
the
lodges
if
you
did
not
do
it
you
know
very
well
that
i
should
you
puppy
replied
his
father
and
so
saying
he
turned
into
a
walk
which
led
in
a
direction
as
opposite
as
possible
from
that
which
his
ireful
lady
had
chosen
colonel
harrington
felt
that
it
required
some
exertion
of
his
conversational
powers
to
bring
his
fair
companions
back
to
the
tone
of
cheerful
familiarity
which
had
reigned
among
them
all
at
the
but
the
exertion
was
made
and
so
successfully
that
before
the
walk
was
ended
a
feeling
of
perfect
confidence
was
established
between
them
when
they
were
about
to
part
he
said
my
mother
and
i
shall
labour
and
cease
not
to
work
our
way
through
the
to
the
kernel
of
my
good
father
heart
and
there
we
shall
find
exactly
the
material
we
want
of
which
to
form
a
reconciliation
between
your
mother
and
farewell
helen
farewell
miss
torrington
i
trust
that
while
the
interdict
lasts
chance
will
sometimes
favour
our
meeting
beyond
the
forbidden
precincts
he
stepped
forward
to
open
the
park
gate
for
them
shook
hands
uttered
another
farewell
and
departed
chapter
mowbray
consults
cartwright
upon
the
subject
of
her
late
husband
will
the
first
person
they
encountered
on
entering
the
house
was
fanny
where
you
been
she
exclaimed
my
mother
is
half
frightened
to
death
do
go
to
her
this
moment
helen
to
set
her
heart
at
ease
where
is
she
fanny
inquired
helen
with
a
sigh
as
she
remembered
how
little
the
answers
she
must
necessarily
give
to
the
questions
she
would
be
sure
to
ask
were
likely
to
produce
that
effect
in
her
helen
but
where
you
been
to
oakley
good
gracious
helen
and
without
asking
mamma
leave
i
did
it
with
a
good
intention
fanny
do
you
think
i
was
wrong
in
endeavouring
to
restore
the
intimacy
that
has
been
so
cruelly
interrupted
do
you
think
mamma
will
be
very
angry
i
am
sure
it
was
chiefly
for
her
sake
that
i
went
no
i
am
sure
she
will
not
when
you
tell
her
that
but
come
directly
i
do
assure
you
she
has
been
seriously
did
you
find
sir
gilbert
very
savage
rosalind
my
dear
another
moment
brought
them
to
mowbray
thank
heaven
was
her
first
exclamation
on
seeing
them
and
the
repetition
of
fanny
emphatic
where
you
been
followed
it
dearest
mother
said
helen
fondly
embracing
her
do
not
chide
us
very
severely
even
if
we
have
been
wrong
for
indeed
we
meant
to
be
very
very
right
and
when
we
set
out
the
expedition
appeared
to
us
anything
but
a
pleasant
one
we
have
been
to
oakley
i
am
too
thankful
at
seeing
you
returned
in
safety
my
dear
girls
to
be
very
angry
at
any
thing
but
do
tell
me
helen
what
could
have
induced
you
to
volunteer
a
visit
to
the
only
people
who
have
been
unkind
to
us
since
your
poor
father
death
in
the
hope
mamma
of
putting
an
end
to
an
estrangement
which
i
thought
was
very
painful
to
you
dearest
helen
it
was
just
like
you
and
have
you
succeeded
my
love
no
mamma
i
have
not
mowbray
coloured
and
pray
helen
have
they
explained
to
you
the
cause
of
their
extraordinary
and
most
unfeeling
conduct
do
not
say
dearest
mother
lady
harrington
is
greatly
distressed
at
sir
gilbert
conduct
so
is
the
colonel
who
is
just
come
home
whatever
fault
there
may
be
it
is
sir
gilbert
alone
did
he
then
explain
himself
to
you
helen
remained
silent
i
must
request
helen
resumed
her
mother
that
you
make
no
farther
mystery
about
the
harringtons
i
am
willing
to
excuse
the
strange
step
you
took
this
morning
but
i
shall
be
seriously
displeased
if
you
refuse
to
tell
me
what
passed
during
your
visit
of
what
is
it
that
sir
gilbert
accuses
me
i
pointed
out
to
him
mamma
the
injustice
of
being
angry
with
you
because
papa
made
a
will
that
he
did
not
approve
well
helen
and
what
did
he
say
to
that
upon
my
word
mamma
i
could
not
find
a
shadow
of
reason
in
any
thing
he
said
you
evade
my
questions
helen
i
insist
upon
knowing
what
it
is
that
sir
gilbert
lays
to
my
helen
do
you
refuse
to
answer
me
oh
no
mamma
but
you
can
not
think
how
painful
it
would
be
for
me
to
repeat
it
i
can
not
help
it
helen
you
have
brought
this
pain
on
yourself
by
your
very
unadvised
visit
of
this
morning
but
since
you
have
gone
to
the
house
of
one
who
has
declared
himself
my
enemy
you
must
let
me
know
exactly
what
it
is
he
has
chosen
to
accuse
me
of
unless
you
mean
that
i
should
imagine
you
wish
to
shield
him
from
my
resentment
because
you
think
him
right
oh
my
mother
cried
helen
what
a
word
is
that
well
then
do
not
trifle
with
me
any
longer
but
repeat
at
once
all
that
you
heard
him
say
thus
urged
poor
helen
stated
sir
gilbert
very
unjust
suspicions
respecting
the
influence
used
to
induce
mowbray
to
make
the
will
he
had
left
it
was
in
vain
she
endeavoured
to
modify
and
soften
the
accusation
the
resentment
and
indignation
of
mowbray
were
unbounded
and
helen
had
the
deep
mortification
of
perceiving
that
the
only
result
of
her
enterprise
was
to
have
rendered
the
breach
she
so
greatly
wished
to
repair
a
hundred
times
wider
than
before
and
this
man
with
these
base
and
vile
suspicions
is
the
person
your
father
has
left
as
joint
executor
with
me
what
a
situation
does
this
place
me
in
did
he
make
any
allusion
to
this
helen
did
he
say
any
thing
of
the
necessary
business
that
we
have
most
unfortunately
to
transact
together
no
mamma
he
did
not
a
long
silence
followed
this
question
and
answer
mowbray
appeared
to
suffer
greatly
and
in
fact
she
did
so
nothing
could
be
farther
from
the
truth
than
the
idea
sir
gilbert
harrington
had
conceived
and
its
injustice
revolted
and
irritated
her
to
a
degree
that
she
never
before
experienced
against
any
human
being
that
helen
should
have
listened
to
such
an
accusation
pained
her
extremely
and
a
feeling
in
some
degree
allied
to
displeasure
against
her
mingled
with
the
disagreeable
meditations
in
which
she
was
plunged
my
head
aches
dreadfully
she
said
at
last
fanny
give
me
my
shawl
and
parasol
i
will
try
what
a
walk
in
the
fresh
air
will
do
for
me
may
i
go
with
you
mamma
said
helen
no
my
dear
you
have
had
quite
walking
enough
fanny
has
not
been
out
at
all
she
may
come
with
me
these
words
were
both
natural
and
reasonable
but
there
was
something
in
them
that
smote
helen
to
the
heart
she
fondly
loved
her
mother
and
for
the
first
time
she
suspected
that
her
heart
and
feelings
were
not
understood
mowbray
and
fanny
had
just
walked
through
the
library
windows
into
the
garden
when
they
perceived
cartwright
approaching
the
house
they
both
uttered
an
exclamation
of
pleasure
at
perceiving
him
and
fanny
said
eagerly
he
must
see
us
mamma
do
not
let
him
go
all
the
way
round
to
the
may
we
not
walk
across
and
meet
him
to
be
sure
run
forward
fanny
and
when
he
sees
you
coming
to
him
he
will
turn
this
way
she
was
not
mistaken
fanny
had
not
made
three
steps
in
advance
of
her
mother
before
cartwright
turned
from
the
road
and
passing
through
a
gate
in
the
invisible
fence
joined
her
in
a
moment
how
kind
this
is
of
you
said
he
as
he
drew
near
to
appear
thus
willing
to
receive
again
an
intruder
whose
quick
return
must
lead
you
to
suspect
that
you
are
in
danger
of
being
haunted
by
him
and
so
i
think
you
are
miss
fanny
and
i
will
be
generous
enough
to
tell
you
at
once
that
if
you
greet
me
thus
kindly
i
shall
hardly
know
how
to
keep
away
from
mowbray
park
but
mamma
is
so
glad
to
see
you
said
fanny
blushing
beautifully
that
i
am
sure
you
need
not
try
to
keep
away
mowbray
now
drew
near
to
answer
for
herself
which
she
did
very
cordially
assuring
him
that
she
considered
these
friendly
and
unceremonious
visits
as
the
greatest
kindness
he
could
show
her
it
will
be
long
i
think
said
she
before
i
shall
have
courage
sufficient
to
invite
any
one
to
this
mournful
and
mansion
but
those
whose
friendship
i
really
value
will
i
trust
have
the
charity
to
come
to
us
without
waiting
for
an
invitation
i
wish
i
could
prove
to
you
my
dear
madam
replied
cartwright
with
respectful
tenderness
how
fervently
i
desire
to
serve
you
but
surrounded
by
old
and
friends
as
you
must
be
how
can
a
and
a
stranger
hope
to
be
useful
this
was
touching
a
very
tender
point
and
it
is
just
possible
that
cartwright
was
aware
of
it
as
he
was
present
at
the
reading
of
the
will
and
heard
sir
gilbert
harrington
first
burst
of
rage
on
becoming
acquainted
with
its
contents
but
mowbray
had
either
forgotten
this
circumstance
or
feeling
deeply
disturbed
at
the
fresh
proof
which
helen
had
brought
her
of
the
falling
off
of
an
old
friend
was
disposed
to
revert
anew
to
it
in
the
hope
of
moving
the
compasssion
and
propitiating
the
kindness
of
a
new
one
alas
my
dear
sir
she
said
feelingly
even
old
friends
will
sometimes
fail
us
and
then
it
is
that
we
ought
to
thank
god
for
such
happy
accidents
as
that
which
has
placed
near
us
one
so
able
and
kindly
willing
to
supply
their
place
as
fanny
my
love
the
business
on
which
i
have
to
speak
is
a
painful
one
go
to
your
sister
dearest
while
i
ask
our
kind
friend
advice
respecting
this
unhappy
business
then
cartwright
said
fanny
holding
out
her
hand
to
but
perhaps
i
shall
see
you
again
as
you
go
away
for
i
shall
be
in
the
garden
bless
you
my
dear
child
said
he
fervently
as
he
led
her
a
few
steps
towards
the
shrubberies
god
bless
and
have
you
in
his
holy
keeping
what
an
especial
blessing
have
you
my
dear
friend
he
said
returning
to
mowbray
in
that
charming
child
watch
over
her
and
guard
her
from
all
evil
for
she
is
one
who
if
guided
in
that
only
path
which
leads
to
good
will
be
a
saving
and
a
precious
treasure
to
all
who
belong
to
her
but
if
led
astray
alas
the
guilt
that
the
downfall
of
so
pure
a
spirit
would
entail
on
those
whose
duty
it
is
to
watch
over
her
she
is
indeed
an
excellent
young
creature
said
the
proud
mother
whose
darling
the
lovely
fanny
had
ever
been
but
i
think
she
wants
less
guiding
than
any
child
i
ever
saw
and
it
has
always
been
so
she
learned
faster
than
she
could
be
taught
and
her
temper
is
so
sweet
and
her
heart
so
affectionate
that
i
really
do
not
remember
that
she
has
ever
deserved
a
reprimand
in
her
life
may
the
precepts
of
her
admirable
mother
ever
keep
her
thus
said
cartwright
as
they
seated
themselves
in
the
library
into
which
they
had
entered
but
oh
my
dear
lady
know
you
not
that
it
is
just
such
sweet
and
gifted
creatures
as
your
fanny
that
the
evil
one
seeks
for
his
own
nay
look
not
thus
terrified
my
excellent
my
exemplary
friend
look
not
thus
terrified
if
it
be
thus
as
most
surely
it
is
think
you
that
we
are
left
without
help
to
resist
my
dear
my
admirable
mowbray
yours
is
the
hand
appointed
to
lead
this
fair
and
attractive
being
unspotted
through
the
world
if
great
awfully
great
as
assuredly
it
is
be
the
responsibility
great
unspeakably
great
will
be
the
reward
then
tremble
not
dear
friend
watch
and
pray
and
this
unmeasurable
reward
shall
be
yours
mowbray
however
did
tremble
but
her
trembling
was
accompanied
by
a
sweet
and
consciousness
of
being
considered
by
the
excellent
man
beside
her
as
capable
of
leading
this
darling
child
to
eternal
happiness
and
glory
the
look
the
accent
of
cartwright
went
farther
than
his
words
to
convince
her
that
he
believed
this
power
to
be
hers
and
she
gazed
at
him
with
something
of
the
reverence
and
humble
love
with
which
catholics
contemplate
the
effigies
of
the
saints
they
worship
but
what
was
the
business
the
painful
business
my
poor
friend
upon
which
you
wished
to
consult
me
before
that
vision
of
light
had
drawn
all
our
attention
upon
herself
what
was
it
my
dear
mowbray
you
wished
to
say
to
me
i
am
hardly
justified
i
fear
cartwright
thus
early
in
our
acquaintance
in
taking
up
your
valuable
time
in
listening
to
my
sorrows
and
my
wrongs
but
in
truth
i
have
both
to
bear
and
i
have
at
this
moment
no
friend
near
me
to
whom
i
can
apply
for
advice
how
to
proceed
with
business
that
puzzles
almost
as
much
as
it
distresses
me
may
i
then
my
dear
sir
intrude
on
your
kindness
for
half
an
hour
while
i
state
to
you
the
singular
predicament
in
which
i
am
placed
were
it
not
as
most
assuredly
it
is
were
it
not
dearest
mowbray
a
true
and
pleasure
to
me
to
believe
that
i
might
possibly
be
useful
to
you
it
would
be
my
especial
and
bounden
duty
to
strive
to
be
so
for
what
are
the
ministers
of
the
most
high
placed
amidst
the
people
wherefore
are
their
voices
raised
so
that
all
should
hear
them
is
it
not
my
friend
because
their
lives
their
souls
their
bodies
are
devoted
to
the
service
of
those
committed
by
providence
to
their
care
and
trust
me
the
minister
who
would
shrink
from
this
is
unworthy
utterly
unworthy
the
post
to
which
he
has
been
called
speak
then
dearest
mowbray
as
to
one
bound
alike
by
duty
and
the
most
fervent
to
aid
and
assist
you
to
the
utmost
extent
of
his
power
the
great
natural
gift
of
cartwright
was
the
power
of
making
his
voice
his
eye
and
the
flexible
muscles
of
his
handsome
mouth
echo
and
as
it
were
reverberate
and
reiterate
every
word
he
spoke
giving
to
his
language
a
power
beyond
its
own
what
he
now
said
was
uttered
rapidly
but
with
an
apparent
depth
and
intensity
of
feeling
that
brought
tears
of
mingled
gratitude
and
admiration
to
the
eyes
of
mowbray
after
a
moment
given
to
this
not
unpleasing
emotion
she
said
it
was
from
you
cartwright
if
i
remember
rightly
that
i
first
heard
the
enactments
of
my
husband
will
when
i
give
you
my
word
as
i
now
most
solemnly
do
that
i
had
never
during
his
life
the
slightest
knowledge
of
what
that
will
was
to
be
i
think
you
will
believe
me
believe
you
exclaimed
cartwright
is
there
on
earth
a
being
sufficiently
depraved
to
doubt
an
assertion
so
vouched
by
you
oh
cartwright
if
all
men
had
your
generous
and
i
will
say
just
confidence
in
me
i
should
not
now
be
in
the
position
i
am
but
sir
gilbert
harrington
the
person
most
unhappily
chosen
by
mowbray
as
joint
executor
with
myself
is
persuaded
that
this
generous
will
was
made
in
my
favour
solely
in
consequence
of
my
artful
influence
over
him
and
so
deeply
does
he
resent
this
imputed
crime
that
instead
of
standing
forward
as
he
ought
to
do
as
the
protector
and
agent
of
his
friend
widow
he
loads
the
memory
of
that
friend
with
insult
and
oppresses
me
with
scorn
and
revilings
the
more
bitter
because
conveyed
to
me
by
my
own
child
mowbray
mr
cartwright
hid
his
face
with
his
hands
and
for
some
moments
seemed
fearful
of
betraying
all
he
felt
at
length
he
fixed
his
eyes
upon
her
eyes
moistened
by
a
tear
and
in
a
low
deep
voice
that
seemed
to
indicate
an
inward
struggle
he
uttered
is
mine
saith
the
he
closed
his
eyes
and
sat
for
a
moment
silent
then
added
perhaps
of
all
the
trials
to
which
we
are
exposed
in
this
world
of
temptation
the
obeying
this
mandate
is
the
most
difficult
but
like
all
uttered
by
its
divine
author
it
is
blessed
alike
by
its
authority
and
its
use
without
it
my
friend
without
it
would
not
my
hand
be
grappling
the
throat
of
your
malignant
enemy
without
it
should
i
not
even
now
be
seeking
to
violate
the
laws
of
god
and
man
to
bring
the
wretch
who
can
thus
stab
an
angel
woman
breast
to
the
dust
before
her
but
thanks
to
the
faith
that
is
in
me
i
that
his
suspicious
heart
and
cruel
soul
shall
meet
a
vengeance
as
much
greater
than
any
i
could
inflict
as
the
hand
that
wields
it
is
more
powerful
than
mine
i
humbly
thank
heaven
for
this
and
remembering
it
turn
with
chastened
spirit
from
the
forbidden
task
of
punishing
him
to
the
far
more
christian
one
of
offering
aid
to
the
gentle
being
he
would
was
it
indeed
from
the
lips
of
your
child
my
poor
friend
that
these
base
aspersions
reached
you
it
was
indeed
cartwright
and
it
was
this
which
made
them
cut
so
deeply
poor
helen
knew
not
what
she
was
about
when
she
secretly
left
her
mother
roof
to
visit
this
man
in
the
hope
of
restoring
the
families
to
their
former
habits
of
intimacy
did
helen
do
this
said
cartwright
with
a
sort
of
shiver
yes
poor
thing
she
did
and
perhaps
for
her
pains
may
have
won
caresses
for
herself
but
by
her
own
statement
most
reluctantly
given
certainly
she
seems
to
have
listened
to
calumnies
against
her
mother
which
i
should
have
thought
no
child
of
mine
would
have
borne
to
hear
and
again
mowbray
shed
tears
gracious
heaven
exclaimed
cartwright
fervently
clasping
his
hands
dear
tortured
mowbray
turn
your
weeping
eyes
to
heaven
those
drops
shall
not
fall
in
vain
it
was
your
child
a
child
nurtured
in
that
gentle
bosom
who
repeated
to
you
this
blasphemy
oh
fie
fie
fie
but
let
us
not
think
of
this
at
least
not
at
this
trying
moment
hereafter
means
must
be
taken
to
stay
this
from
spreading
over
the
hearts
of
all
whom
nature
has
given
to
love
and
honour
you
your
pretty
gentle
fanny
she
at
least
will
not
i
think
be
led
to
listen
to
any
voice
that
shall
speak
ill
of
you
sweet
child
let
her
be
near
your
heart
and
that
will
comfort
but
alas
my
poor
friend
this
maternal
disappointment
grievous
as
it
is
will
not
be
all
you
have
to
bear
from
this
wretch
whom
heaven
for
its
good
but
inscrutable
purposes
permits
to
persecute
you
there
must
be
business
my
dear
mowbray
business
of
great
importance
that
this
man
must
be
immediately
called
upon
to
execute
with
you
the
proving
the
will
for
instance
he
must
either
do
this
or
refuse
to
act
would
to
heaven
he
might
refuse
said
mowbray
eagerly
what
a
relief
would
this
be
to
me
cartwright
do
you
think
there
would
be
any
possibility
of
leading
him
to
it
of
leading
him
certainly
not
for
it
is
very
clear
from
his
conduct
that
whatever
you
appeared
to
wish
he
would
be
averse
to
do
your
only
hope
of
obtaining
what
would
most
assuredly
be
an
especial
blessing
for
you
his
formal
renunciation
of
the
executorship
would
i
think
be
from
writing
to
him
immediately
and
imperatively
demanding
his
joining
you
forthwith
in
proving
the
will
in
such
a
state
of
mind
as
he
must
be
in
before
he
would
bear
to
utter
his
vile
suspicions
to
your
daughter
i
think
it
very
likely
he
may
refuse
and
what
would
happen
then
mr
cartwright
you
must
place
yourself
in
the
hands
of
a
respectable
lawyer
totally
a
stranger
and
unconnected
with
him
and
he
would
put
you
in
a
way
to
prove
it
yourself
after
which
he
could
give
you
no
further
trouble
of
any
kind
unless
indeed
your
misguided
children
should
continue
to
frequent
his
house
and
so
become
the
means
of
wounding
your
ears
and
your
heart
by
repeating
his
calumnies
but
this
i
trust
the
source
of
all
wisdom
and
goodness
will
give
you
power
to
prevent
with
your
help
and
counsel
cartwright
i
may
yet
hope
to
weather
the
storm
that
seems
to
have
burst
upon
me
but
indeed
it
could
hardly
have
burst
upon
any
one
less
capable
of
struggling
with
it
in
what
language
should
i
write
to
this
cruel
man
who
has
so
undeservedly
become
my
enemy
there
is
no
difficulty
there
my
friend
the
shortest
and
most
strictly
ceremonious
form
must
be
the
best
mowbray
drew
towards
her
materials
for
writing
opened
the
portfolio
which
between
its
leaves
of
contained
sundry
sheets
of
post
placed
one
of
them
before
her
took
a
pen
and
curiously
examined
its
tip
dipped
it
delicately
in
the
ink
and
finally
turned
to
cartwright
saying
how
very
grateful
i
should
be
if
you
would
have
the
great
kindness
to
write
it
for
me
but
the
handwriting
my
dear
lady
must
be
yours
oh
yes
i
know
but
it
would
be
so
much
more
satisfactory
if
you
would
sketch
the
form
then
i
am
sure
i
will
do
it
most
readily
he
drew
the
paper
to
him
and
wrote
mowbray
presents
her
compliments
to
sir
gilbert
harrington
and
requests
to
know
on
what
day
it
will
suit
him
to
meet
her
and
her
lawyer
in
london
for
the
purpose
of
proving
her
late
husband
will
at
doctors
commons
the
amount
of
the
real
property
may
be
ascertained
by
the

of
the
personal
by
means
of
papers
left
by
the
deceased
and
a
valuation
of
the
effects
made
by
competent
persons
mowbray
begs
leave
to
intimate
that
she
wishes
as
little
delay
as
possible
to
intervene
before
the
completion
of
this
transaction
cartwright
turned
what
he
had
written
towards
her
saying
this
is
the
sort
of
letter
which
i
should
think
it
advisable
to
send
mowbray
drew
forth
another
sheet
and
transcribed
it
so
rapidly
that
it
might
be
doubted
whether
she
allowed
herself
time
to
read
it
as
she
did
so
and
this
should
be
despatched
instantly
should
it
not
she
said
folding
and
directing
it
indeed
i
think
so
then
will
you
have
the
kindness
to
ring
the
bell
mr
cartwright
bring
me
a
lighted
taper
john
said
mowbray
to
the
servant
who
entered
and
let
thomas
get
a
horse
ready
to
take
this
letter
immediately
to
oakley
the
taper
was
brought
the
letter
sealed
and
delivered
with
instructions
that
the
bearer
was
to
wait
for
an
answer
this
important
business
concluded
cartwright
rose
to
go
saying
you
have
filled
my
heart
and
my
head
so
completely
by
the
communication
of
sir
gilbert
harrington
conduct
that
i
protest
to
you
i
do
not
at
this
moment
recollect
why
it
was
i
troubled
you
with
a
visit
this
morning
i
shall
recollect
it
i
dare
say
when
i
see
you
no
longer
and
if
i
do
you
must
let
me
come
back
before
very
long
to
tell
you
but
whether
you
recollect
it
or
not
replied
mowbray
in
a
plaintive
tone
i
trust
you
will
not
let
it
be
long
before
i
see
you
otherwise
cartwright
i
shall
not
know
how
to
proceed
when
i
receive
sir
gilbert
answer
this
appeal
was
answered
by
an
assurance
uttered
in
a
tone
of
the
most
soothing
kindness
that
he
would
never
be
far
from
her
when
she
wished
him
near
and
then
with
a
pastoral
and
affectionate
pressure
of
her
hand
he
left
her
fanny
kept
her
word
and
was
walking
up
and
down
about
a
dozen
yards
from
that
end
of
the
shrubbery
which
terminated
in
the
road
leading
to
the
house
cartwright
looked
in
that
direction
as
he
stepped
from
the
library
window
and
walking
quickly
to
the
spot
conversed
with
her
for
several
minutes
as
she
stood
leaning
over
the
gate
fanny
smiled
blushed
and
looked
delighted
her
hand
too
was
pressed
with
affectionate
kindness
and
cartwright
returned
to
his
vicarage
and
his
early
dinner

on
the
subject
of
the
will
when
miss
torrington
and
helen
retreated
to
the
appropriated
to
the
former
which
was
the
apartment
in
which
they
generally
pursued
their
morning
studies
they
sat
down
disconsolately
enough
to
review
the
results
of
their
enterprise
everything
is
ten
times
worse
than
it
was
before
helen
said
her
friend
and
it
is
all
my
fault
your
fault
oh
no
but
i
believe
we
are
both
of
us
too
young
to
interfere
with
any
reasonable
hope
of
doing
good
between
those
who
in
age
and
wisdom
are
so
greatly
our
superiors
oh
rosalind
i
fear
i
fear
that
my
dearest
mother
is
very
angry
with
me
i
can
not
believe
it
helen
i
hardly
know
how
far
a
dutiful
daughter
may
be
permitted
to
act
like
a
rational
human
being
but
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
and
belief
your
conduct
has
been
such
as
to
ensure
you
the
approbation
and
gratitude
of
any
mother
in
the
world
at
least
of
any
reasonable
mother
you
know
helen
how
truly
fond
i
have
become
of
my
is
there
such
a
word
i
believe
not
of
my
guardian
then
during
the
eight
months
that
i
have
made
one
of
her
family
i
have
never
yet
received
a
harsh
word
or
unkind
look
from
her
though
i
have
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
i
have
deserved
many
but
nevertheless
my
own
dear
helen
if
she
should
blunder
so
egregiously
as
to
be
really
angry
with
you
for
acting
with
such
zealous
tender
affection
as
you
have
done
this
morning
merely
because
that
obstinate
old
brute
sir
gilbert
was
not
to
be
brought
to
reason
if
she
should
really
act
thus
which
i
trust
in
god
she
will
not
but
if
she
should
i
do
verily
believe
in
all
sincerity
that
i
should
hate
her
no
you
would
not
you
would
not
be
so
unjust
rosalind
what
right
had
we
to
volunteer
our
silly
services
what
right
had
i
in
particular
to
fancy
that
if
sir
gilbert
would
not
listen
to
the
remonstrances
of
his
excellent
and
very
clever
wife
he
would
listen
to
mine
i
really
am
ashamed
of
my
silly
vanity
and
most
gross
presumption
and
if
my
dear
dearest
mother
will
but
forgive
me
this
once
as
all
naughty
children
say
i
do
not
believe
she
will
ever
have
cause
to
chide
me
for
meddling
again
oh
rosalind
if
she
did
but
know
how
i
love
her
she
could
never
have
looked
so
coldly
on
me
as
she
did
when
she
told
me
i
had
had
walking
enough
i
hope
you
are
mistaken
i
hope
she
did
not
look
coldly
on
you
i
hope
she
is
not
angry
for
if
she
be
i
shall
go
over
to
the
enemy
helen
as
sure
as
my
name
is
rosalind
and
you
may
live
to
see
me
patting
the
rough
hide
of
that
very
shaggy
british
sir
gilbert
every
time
he
says
something
impertinent
against
your
mother
there
is
one
thing
said
helen
slightly
colouring
that
does
in
some
little
degree
reconcile
me
to
the
unfortunate
visit
of
this
morning
and
that
this
the
having
met
colonel
harrington
cried
rosalind
interrupting
her
is
it
not
so
you
are
right
replied
her
friend
composedly
william
harrington
when
he
was
simply
william
harrington
and
not
a
dashing
colonel
of
dragoons
was
kindness
itself
to
me
when
i
was
a
puny
fretful
girl
that
cried
when
i
ought
to
have
laughed
i
can
not
forget
his
protecting
ways
with
me
and
i
should
have
been
truly
sorry
if
he
had
left
the
country
again
as
i
suppose
he
will
soon
do
without
my
seeing
him
truly
i
believe
you
my
dear
replied
rosalind
laughing
and
your
plain
william
harrington
too
seemed
as
willing
to
renew
the
acquaintance
as
yourself
to
tell
you
the
truth
helen
i
thought
i
saw
symptoms
of
a
mighty
pretty
little
incipient
flirtation
how
can
you
talk
such
nonsense
when
we
have
so
much
to
make
us
sad
do
you
think
i
had
better
go
and
see
if
mamma
is
come
in
rosalind
i
can
not
express
to
you
how
miserable
i
shall
be
as
long
as
i
think
that
she
is
angry
with
me
at
this
moment
the
bell
which
announced
that
the
luncheon
was
ready
sounded
and
poor
helen
exclaimed
oh
i
am
so
sorry
i
ought
to
have
sought
her
again
before
meeting
her
in
this
manner
but
come
perhaps
her
dear
face
will
look
smilingly
at
me
again
how
i
will
kiss
her
if
it
does
but
the
warm
heart
was
again
chilled
to
its
very
core
by
the
look
mowbray
wore
as
the
two
girls
entered
the
room
fanny
was
already
seated
next
her
this
was
a
place
often
playfully
contested
between
the
sisters
and
helen
thought
as
she
approached
the
door
that
if
she
could
get
it
and
once
more
feel
her
mother
hand
between
her
own
she
should
be
the
happiest
creature
living
but
nothing
could
be
less
alike
than
what
followed
her
entrance
to
the
imaginings
which
preceded
it
mowbray
was
unusually
silent
to
them
all
but
to
helen
she
addressed
not
a
single
word
this
was
partly
owing
to
the
feeling
of
displeasure
which
had
recently
been
so
skilfully
fastened
in
her
breast
and
partly
to
the
anxiety
she
felt
respecting
the
answer
of
sir
gilbert
to
her
note
in
the
middle
of
the
silent
and
nearly
untasted
meal
the
poetical
fanny
being
in
truth
the
only
one
who
appeared
to
have
much
inclination
to
eat
a
salver
was
presented
to
mowbray
from
whence
with
a
heightened
colour
and
almost
trembling
hand
she
took
a
note
she
instantly
rose
from
table
and
left
the
room
helen
rose
too
but
not
to
follow
her
she
could
no
longer
restrain
her
tears
and
it
was
to
hide
this
from
fanny
and
if
possible
from
rosalind
that
she
hastened
to
leave
them
both
and
shut
herself
in
her
own
chamber
to
weep
alone
the
present
emotion
of
helen
can
not
be
understood
without
referring
to
the
manner
in
which
she
had
hitherto
lived
with
her
mother
and
indeed
to
the
general
habits
of
the
family
mystery
of
any
kind
was
unknown
among
them
and
to
those
who
have
observed
the
effect
of
this
its
prodigious
influence
on
the
general
tone
of
family
intercourse
must
be
well
known
to
those
who
have
not
it
would
be
nearly
impossible
to
convey
in
words
an
adequate
idea
of
the
difference
which
exists
in
a
household
where
the
parents
make
a
secret
of
all
things
of
important
interest
and
where
they
do
not
it
is
not
the
difference
between
ease
and
restraint
or
even
that
more
striking
still
between
sweet
and
sour
tempers
in
the
chief
or
chiefs
of
the
establishment
it
is
a
thousand
times
more
vital
than
either
without
this
easy
natural
spontaneous
confidence
the
family
union
is
like
a
rope
of
sand
that
will
fall
to
pieces
and
disappear
at
the
first
touch
of
any
thing
that
can
attract
and
draw
off
its
loose
and
unbound
particles
but
if
it
be
important
as
a
general
family
habit
it
is
ten
thousand
times
more
so
in
the
intercourse
between
a
mother
and
her
daughters
let
no
parent
believe
that
affection
can
be
perfect
without
it
and
let
no
mother
fancy
that
the
heart
of
her
girl
can
be
open
to
her
if
it
find
not
an
open
heart
in
return
mothers
if
you
value
the
precious
deposit
of
your
dear
inmost
thoughts
peril
not
the
treasure
by
chilling
them
with
any
mystery
of
your
own
it
is
not
in
the
nature
of
things
that
confidence
should
exist
on
one
side
only
it
must
be
mutual
never
was
there
less
of
this
hateful
mildew
of
mystery
than
in
the
mowbray
family
during
the
life
of
their
father
whatever
were
the
questions
that
arose
whether
they
concerned
the
purchase
of
an
estate
or
the
giving
or
accepting
an
invitation
to
dinner
whether
it
were
a
discussion
respecting
the
character
of
a
neighbour
or
the
flavour
of
the
last
packet
of
tea
they
were
ever
and
always
canvassed
in
full
assembly
or
if
any
members
were
wanting
it
was
because
curiosity
which
lives
only
by
searching
for
what
is
hid
lacking
its
proper
aliment
had
perished
altogether
and
so
set
the
listeners
free
this
secrecy
in
her
mother
struck
therefore
like
a
bolt
of
ice
into
the
very
heart
of
the
sensitive
helen
have
i
lost
her
for
ever
she
exclaimed
aloud
though
in
solitude
mother
mother
is
it
to
be
ever
thus
if
this
be
the
consequence
of
my
poor
father
will
well
might
sir
gilbert
deplore
it
how
happily
could
i
have
lived
for
ever
dependent
on
her
for
my
daily
bread
so
i
could
have
kept
her
heart
for
ever
as
open
as
my
own
at
this
period
helen
mowbray
had
much
suffering
before
her
but
she
never
perhaps
felt
a
pang
more
bitter
in
its
newness
than
that
which
accompanied
the
conviction
that
her
mother
had
a
secret
which
she
meant
not
to
communicate
to
her
she
felt
the
fact
to
be
what
it
really
was
neither
more
nor
less
she
felt
that
it
announced
the
dissolution
of
that
sweet
and
perfect
harmony
which
had
hitherto
existed
between
them
the
note
from
sir
gilbert
harrington
was
as
follows
sir
gilbert
harrington
presents
his
compliments
to
mowbray
and
begs
to
inform
her
that
he
has
not
the
slightest
intention
of
ever
acting
as
executor
to
the
very
singular
and
mysterious
document
opened
in
his
presence
on
the
of
may
last
past
purporting
to
be
the
last
will
and
testament
of
his
late
friend
charles
mowbray
esquire
oakley
june
the
lady
had
gone
to
her
secret
bower
to
peruse
this
scroll
and
it
was
fortunate
perhaps
that
she
did
so
for
it
produced
in
her
a
sensation
of
anger
so
much
more
violent
than
she
was
accustomed
to
feel
that
she
would
have
done
herself
injustice
by
betraying
it
mowbray
had
passed
her
life
in
such
utter
ignorance
of
every
kind
of
business
and
such
blind
and
helpless
dependence
first
on
her
guardians
and
then
on
her
husband
that
the
idea
of
acting
for
herself
was
scarcely
less
terrible
than
the
notion
of
navigating
a
would
be
to
ladies
in
general
her
thoughts
now
turned
towards
cartwright
as
to
a
champion
equally
able
and
willing
to
help
and
defend
her
and
she
raised
her
eyes
to
heaven
with
fervent
gratitude
for
the
timely
happiness
of
having
met
with
such
a
friend
that
friend
had
pointed
out
to
her
the
fault
committed
by
helen
in
a
manner
that
made
it
appear
to
her
almost
unpardonable
to
have
doubted
the
correctness
of
his
judgment
on
this
or
any
point
would
have
been
to
doubt
the
stability
of
that
staff
which
providence
had
sent
her
to
lean
upon
in
this
moment
of
her
utmost
need
she
doubted
him
not
and
helen
was
accordingly
thrust
out
not
without
a
pang
perhaps
from
that
warm
and
sacred
station
in
her
mother
heart
that
it
had
been
the
first
happiness
of
her
existence
to
fill
poor
helen
matters
were
going
worse
for
her
far
worse
than
she
imagined
though
she
was
unhappy
and
out
of
spirits
she
believed
indeed
that
her
mother
was
really
angry
but
terrible
as
her
forebodings
were
she
dreamed
not
that
she
was
already
and
for
ever
estranged
as
soon
as
the
first
burst
of
passionate
anger
had
been
relieved
by
a
solitary
flood
of
tears
mowbray
called
a
council
with
herself
as
to
whether
she
should
immediately
despatch
a
messenger
to
request
cartwright
to
call
upon
her
in
the
evening
or
whether
she
should
trust
to
the
interest
he
had
so
warmly
expressed
which
if
sincere
must
bring
him
to
her
she
thought
on
the
morrow
after
anxiously
debiting
this
point
for
nearly
an
hour
and
deciding
first
on
one
line
of
conduct
and
then
on
the
other
at
least
six
different
times
within
that
period
she
at
last
determined
to
await
his
coming
and
concealing
the
doubts
and
fears
which
worried
her
by
confining
herself
to
her
room
under
pretence
of
headach
the
three
girls
were
left
to
pass
the
remainder
of
the
day
by
themselves
when
as
may
easily
be
imagined
the
important
events
of
the
morning
were
fully
discussed
among
them
fanny
after
the
motives
of
the
visit
to
oakley
had
been
fully
explained
to
her
gave
it
as
her
opinion
that
helen
was
wrong
in
going
without
the
consent
of
her
mother
but
that
her
intention
might
plead
in
atonement
for
it
but
her
indignation
at
hearing
of
the
pertinacious
obstinacy
of
sir
gilbert
was
unbounded
oh
how
my
poor
father
was
deceived
in
him
she
exclaimed
he
must
have
a
truly
bad
heart
to
forsake
and
vilify
my
mother
at
the
time
she
most
wants
the
assistance
of
a
friend
for
you
know
there
is
business
helen
relative
to
the
will
and
the
property
and
all
that
sir
gilbert
understands
it
all
wretch
and
i
doubt
not
he
thinks
he
shall
crush
poor
mamma
to
the
dust
by
thus
leaving
her
as
he
believes
without
a
friend
but
thank
god
he
will
find
he
is
mistaken
what
do
you
mean
fanny
said
rosalind
sharply
i
mean
rosalind
that
mamma
is
without
a
friend
replied
fanny
with
emphasis
it
has
pleased
god
in
his
mercy
to
send
her
one
when
she
most
needed
it
i
trust
that
god
will
restore
to
her
and
to
us
the
old
well
known
and
trusted
friend
of
my
father
said
helen
gravely
on
none
other
can
we
rest
our
hope
for
counsel
and
assistance
when
needed
so
safely
even
if
you
were
right
helen
replied
her
sister
there
would
be
small
comfort
in
your
observation
of
what
advantage
to
mamma
or
to
us
would
the
good
qualities
of
sir
gilbert
he
if
it
be
his
will
as
it
evidently
is
to
estrange
himself
from
us
what
a
contrast
is
the
conduct
of
cartwright
to
his
mr
cartwright
cried
rosalind
distorting
her
pretty
features
into
a
grimace
that
intimated
abundant
scorn
cartwright
there
is
much
consolation
to
be
sure
in
what
an
acquaintance
of
yesterday
can
do
or
say
for
the
loss
of
such
an
old
friend
as
sir
gilbert
harrington
it
would
be
a
sad
thing
for
poor
mamma
if
there
were
not
replied
fanny
of
what
advantage
to
her
i
ask
you
is
the
long
standing
of
her
acquaintance
with
sir
gilbert
if
his
caprice
and
injustice
are
to
make
him
withdraw
himself
at
such
a
time
as
this
and
how
unreasonable
and
unchristianlike
would
it
be
rosalind
were
she
to
refuse
the
friendship
of
cartwright
because
she
has
not
known
him
as
long
the
only
objection
i
see
to
her
treating
cartwright
as
a
confidential
friend
is
that
she
does
not
know
him
at
all
said
rosalind
nor
ever
can
if
she
treats
him
as
you
do
miss
torrington
answered
fanny
colouring
i
believe
edward
wallace
was
an
especial
favourite
of
yours
my
dear
and
that
perhaps
may
in
some
degree
account
for
your
prejudice
against
our
good
mr
confess
rosalind
is
it
not
so
he
was
indeed
an
especial
favourite
with
me
replied
rosalind
gravely
and
for
the
love
i
bear
you
all
and
more
particularly
for
your
sake
fanny
and
your
poor
mother
i
would
give
much
much
much
that
he
were
in
the
place
which
cartwright
holds
but
if
mamma
is
in
want
of
a
man
to
transact
her
business
why
does
she
not
write
to
charles
and
desire
him
to
return
said
helen
the
taking
his
degree
a
few
months
later
would
be
of
little
consequence
charles
said
fanny
with
a
smile
that
seemed
to
mean
a
great
charles
is
one
of
the
most
amiable
beings
in
the
world
but
the
most
incapable
of
undertaking
the
management
of
business
how
can
you
know
any
thing
about
it
fanny
said
helen
looking
at
her
with
surprise
i
heard
cartwright
say
to
mamma
that
charles
was
quite
a
boy
though
a
very
charming
one
helen
looked
vexed
and
rosalind
fixed
her
eyes
upon
fanny
as
if
wishing
she
would
say
more
in
short
continued
fanny
if
sir
gilbert
chooses
to
cut
us
i
see
what
mamma
do
so
proper
and
so
right
as
to
make
a
friend
of
the
clergyman
of
the
parish
her
two
companions
answered
not
a
word
and
the
conversation
was
brought
to
a
close
by
fanny
drawing
from
her
pocket
her
bag
and
her
bosom
sundry
scraps
of
paper
on
which
many
lines
of
unequal
length
were
scrawled
and
on
these
she
appeared
inclined
to
her
fix
whole
attention
this
was
always
considered
by
helen
and
rosalind
as
a
signal
for
departure
for
then
fanny
was
in
a
poetic
mood
a
word
spoken
or
a
movement
made
by
those
around
her
produced
symptoms
of
impatience
and
suffering
which
they
did
not
like
to
witness
their
absence
was
indeed
a
relief
for
pretty
fanny
during
the
few
moments
of
conversation
which
she
had
enjoyed
at
the
gate
of
the
shrubbery
in
the
morning
had
promised
cartwright
to
compose
a
hymn
to
perform
this
promise
to
the
best
of
her
power
was
at
this
moment
the
first
wish
of
her
heart
for
the
amiable
vicar
had
already
contrived
to
see
some
of
those
numerous
offerings
to
apollo
with
which
this
fairest
and
freshest
of
sapphos
beguiled
her
too
abundant
leisure
he
had
pronounced
her
poetic
powers
great
and
worthy
of
higher
themes
than
any
she
had
hitherto
chosen
if
was
most
natural
therefore
that
she
should
now
tax
her
genius
to
the
utmost
to
prove
that
his
first
judgment
had
not
been
too
favourable
so
the
remainder
of
that
long
day
passed
in
melancholy
enough
between
rosalind
and
helen
and
in
finding
rhymes
for
all
the
epithets
of
heaven
on
the
part
of
fanny
chapter
xii
cartwright
letter
to
his
colonel
harrington
the
intelligent
reader
will
not
be
surprised
to
hear
that
cartwright
did
not
suffer
himself
to
be
long
expected
in
vain
on
the
following
morning
fanny
however
was
already
in
the
garden
when
he
arrived
and
as
it
so
happened
that
he
saw
her
as
she
was
hovering
near
the
shrubbery
gate
he
turned
from
the
and
approached
her
how
sweetly
does
youth
when
blessed
with
such
a
cheek
and
eye
as
yours
miss
fanny
accord
with
the
fresh
morning
of
such
a
day
as
this
i
feel
he
added
taking
her
hand
and
looking
in
her
blushing
face
that
my
soul
never
offers
adoration
more
worthy
of
my
maker
than
when
inspired
by
intercourse
with
such
a
being
as
you
oh
mr
cartwright
cried
fanny
avoiding
his
glance
by
fixing
her
beautiful
eyes
upon
the
ground
my
dearest
child
fear
not
to
look
at
me
fear
not
to
meet
the
eye
of
a
friend
who
would
watch
over
you
fanny
as
the
minister
of
heaven
should
watch
over
that
which
is
best
and
fairest
to
make
and
keep
it
holy
let
me
have
that
innocent
heart
in
my
keeping
my
dearest
child
and
all
that
is
idle
light
and
vain
shall
be
banished
thence
while
heavenward
thoughts
and
holy
musings
shall
take
its
place
have
you
essayed
to
hymn
the
praises
of
your
god
fanny
since
we
parted
yesterday
this
question
was
accompanied
by
an
encouraging
pat
upon
her
glowing
cheek
and
fanny
her
heart
beating
with
vanity
shyness
hope
fear
and
sundry
other
feelings
drew
the
containing
a
transcript
of
her
yesterday
labours
from
her
bosom
and
placed
it
in
his
hand
cartwright
pressed
it
with
a
sort
of
pious
fervour
to
his
lips
and
enclosing
it
for
greater
security
in
a
letter
which
he
drew
from
his
pocket
he
laid
it
carefully
within
his
waistcoat
on
the
left
side
of
his
person
and
as
near
as
possible
to
that
part
of
it
appropriated
for
the
residence
of
the
heart
this
must
be
examined
in
private
my
beloved
child
said
he
solemnly
the
first
attempt
to
raise
such
a
spirit
as
yours
in
holy
song
has
to
my
feelings
something
as
awful
in
it
as
the
first
glad
movement
of
a
seraph
wing
where
is
your
mother
fanny
she
is
in
the
library
alone
oh
yes
at
least
i
should
think
so
for
i
am
sure
she
is
expecting
you
farewell
then
my
dear
young
friend
pursue
your
solitary
musing
walk
and
remember
fanny
that
as
by
your
talents
you
are
marked
and
set
apart
as
it
were
from
the
great
mass
of
human
souls
so
will
you
be
looked
upon
the
more
fixedly
by
the
searching
eye
of
god
it
is
from
him
you
received
this
talent
keep
it
sacred
to
his
use
as
david
did
and
great
shall
be
your
reward
shall
i
startle
your
good
mother
fanny
if
i
enter
by
the
library
window
oh
no
cartwright
i
am
sure
mamma
would
be
quite
vexed
if
you
always
went
round
that
long
way
up
to
the
door
especially
in
summer
you
know
when
the
windows
are
always
open
once
more
farewell
then
fanny
hand
was
again
tenderly
pressed
and
they
parted
it
would
be
a
needless
lengthening
of
my
tale
were
i
to
record
all
that
passed
at
this
and
three
or
four
subsequent
interviews
which
took
place
between
the
vicar
and
mowbray
on
the
subject
of
proving
the
will
together
with
the
kindest
and
most
soothing
demonstrations
of
rapidly
increasing
friendship
and
esteem
cartwright
conveyed
to
her
very
sound
legal
information
respecting
what
it
was
necessary
for
her
to
do
the
only
difficulty
remaining
seemed
to
arise
from
dislike
to
apply
to
any
friend
in
london
either
for
their
hospitality
or
assistance
during
the
visit
it
was
necessary
she
should
make
there
for
the
completion
of
the
business
this
dislike
arose
from
the
very
disagreeable
difficulties
which
had
been
thrown
in
her
way
by
sir
gilbert
harrington
refusing
to
act
it
would
have
been
very
painful
to
her
as
she
frankly
avowed
to
her
new
friend
to
announce
and
explain
this
refusal
to
any
one
and
it
was
therefore
finally
arranged
between
them
that
he
should
give
her
a
letter
of
introduction
to
a
most
excellent
and
trustworthy
friend
and
relation
of
his
who
was
distinguished
as
he
assured
her
for
being
the
most
honourable
and
conscientious
attorney
in
london
and
perhaps
as
he
added
with
a
sigh
the
only
one
who
constantly
acted
with
the
fear
of
the
lord
before
his
eyes
gladly
did
mowbray
accede
to
this
proposal
for
in
truth
it
removed
a
world
of
anxiety
from
her
mind
and
urged
as
much
by
a
wish
to
prove
how
very
easy
it
was
to
be
independent
of
sir
gilbert
as
by
the
strenuous
advice
of
cartwright
to
lose
no
time
in
bringing
the
business
to
a
conclusion
she
fixed
upon
the
following
week
for
this
troublesome
but
necessary
expedition
it
may
serve
to
throw
a
light
upon
the
kind
and
anxious
interest
which
the
vicar
of
wrexhill
took
in
the
affairs
of
his
widowed
parishioner
if
a
copy
of
his
letter
to
his
cousin
and
friend
stephen
corbold
be
inserted
to
stephen
corbold
esq
solicitor
gray
inn
london
my
dear
and
valued
friend
and
cousin
it
has
at
length
pleased
god
to
enable
me
to
prove
to
you
how
sincere
is
the
gratitude
which
i
have
ever
professed
for
the
important
service
your
father
conferred
upon
me
by
the
timely
loan
of
two
hundred
pounds
when
i
was
as
i
believe
you
know
inconvenienced
by
a
very
troublesome
claim
it
has
been
a
constant
matter
of
regret
to
me
that
i
should
never
through
the
many
years
which
have
since
passed
been
able
to
repay
it
but
if
i
mistake
not
the
service
which
i
am
now
able
to
render
you
will
eventually
prove
such
as
fairly
to
liquidate
your
claim
upon
me
and
from
my
knowledge
of
your
pious
and
honourable
feelings
i
can
not
doubt
your
being
willing
to
deliver
to
me
my
bond
for
the
same
should
your
advantages
from
the
transaction
in
hand
prove
at
all
commensurate
to
my
expectations
here
followed
a
statement
of
the
widow
mowbray
business
in
london
with
the
commentary
upon
the
ways
and
means
which
she
possessed
to
carry
that
and
all
other
business
in
which
she
was
concerned
to
a
satisfactory
conclusion
much
to
the
contentment
of
all
those
fortunate
enough
to
be
employed
as
her
assistants
therein
the
reverend
gentleman
then
proceeded
thus
nor
is
this
all
i
would
wish
to
say
to
you
cousin
stephen
on
the
subject
of
the
widow
mowbray
affairs
and
the
advantages
which
may
arise
to
you
from
the
connexion
which
equally
of
course
for
her
advantage
as
for
yours
i
am
desirous
of
establishing
between
you
i
need
not
tell
cousin
stephen
who
by
the
blessing
of
heaven
upon
your
worthy
endeavours
have
already
been
able
in
a
little
way
to
see
what
law
is
i
need
not
i
say
point
out
to
you
at
any
great
length
how
much
there
must
of
necessity
be
to
do
in
the
management
of
an
estate
and
of
funds
which
bring
in
a
net
income
somewhat
exceeding
fourteen
thousand
pounds
per
annum
now
i
learn
from
my
excellent
friend
mowbray
that
her
late
husband
transacted
the
whole
of
this
business
himself
an
example
which
it
is
impossible
as
i
need
not
remark
for
his
widow
and
sole
legatee
to
follow
she
is
quite
aware
of
this
and
by
a
merciful
dispensation
of
the
most
high
her
mind
appears
to
be
singularly
ductile
and
liable
to
receive
such
impressions
as
a
pious
and
attentive
friend
would
be
able
to
enforce
on
all
points
in
addition
to
this
great
and
heavy
charge
which
it
has
pleased
providence
doubtless
for
his
own
good
purposes
to
lay
upon
her
she
has
also
the
entire
management
as
legal
and
sole
guardian
of
a
young
irish
heiress
of
another
prodigiously
fine
property
consisting
like
her
own
partly
of
money
in
the
english
funds
and
partly
in
houses
and
lands
in
the
north
part
of
ireland
the
business
connected
with
the
torrington
property
is
therefore
at
this
moment
as
well
as
every
thing
concerning
the
widow
affairs
completely
without
any
agent
whatever
and
i
am
not
without
hopes
cousin
stephen
that
by
the
blessing
of
god
to
usward
i
may
be
enabled
to
obtain
the
same
for
you
i
know
the
pious
habit
of
your
mind
cousin
and
that
you
like
myself
never
see
any
remarkable
occurrence
without
clearly
tracing
therein
the
immediate
finger
of
heaven
i
confess
that
throughout
the
whole
of
this
affair
the
sudden
death
of
the
late
owner
of
this
noble
fortune
the
singular
will
he
left
by
which
it
all
has
become
wholly
and
solely
at
the
disposal
of
his
excellent
widow
the
hasty
and
not
overwise
determination
to
renounce
the
executorship
on
the
part
of
this
petulant
sir
gilbert
harrington
the
accident
or
rather
series
of
accidents
by
which
i
have
become
at
once
and
so
unexpectedly
the
chief
stay
support
comfort
consolation
and
adviser
of
this
amiable
but
very
helpless
lady
throughout
the
whole
of
this
i
can
not
i
say
but
observe
the
gracious
providence
of
my
master
who
wills
that
i
should
obtain
power
and
mastery
even
over
the
things
of
this
world
worthless
though
they
be
cousin
stephen
when
set
in
comparison
with
those
of
the
world
to
come
it
is
my
clear
perception
of
the
will
of
heaven
in
this
matter
which
renders
me
willing
yea
ardent
in
my
desire
to
obtain
influence
over
the
mowbray
family
they
are
not
all
however
equally
amiable
to
the
wholesome
guidance
i
would
afford
them
on
the
contrary
it
is
evident
to
me
that
the
youngest
child
is
the
only
one
on
whom
the
lord
is
at
present
disposed
to
pour
forth
a
saving
light
nevertheless
i
will
persevere
peradventure
the
hearts
of
the
disobedient
may
in
the
end
be
turned
to
the
wisdom
of
the
just
and
we
know
right
well
who
it
is
that
can
save
from
all
danger
even
though
a
man
went
to
sea
without
art
a
tempting
of
providence
which
would
in
my
case
be
most
criminal
for
great
in
that
respect
has
been
its
mercy
giving
unto
me
that
light
which
is
needful
to
guide
us
through
the
rocks
and
shoals
for
ever
scattered
amidst
worldly
affairs
thus
much
have
i
written
to
you
cousin
stephen
with
my
own
hand
that
you
might
fully
comprehend
the
work
that
lies
before
us
but
i
will
not
with
pen
and
ink
write
more
unto
you
for
i
trust
i
shall
shortly
see
you
and
that
we
shall
speak
face
to
face
i
am
now
and
ever
cousin
stephen
your
loving
kinsman
and
christian
friend
william
jacob
cartwright
wrexhill
vicarage
july
since
writing
the
above
the
widow
mowbray
has
besought
me
to
instruct
gentleman
who
is
to
act
as
her
to
obtain
lodgings
for
her
in
a
convenient
quarter
of
the
town
and
therefore
this
letter
will
precede
her
nor
can
she
indeed
set
forth
till
you
shall
have
written
in
return
to
inform
her
whereunto
her
equipage
must
be
instructed
to
drive
remember
cousin
that
the
apartments
be
suitable
and
in
choosing
them
recollect
that
it
is
neither
you
nor
i
who
will
pay
for
the
same
farewell
if
i
mistake
not
the
mercy
of
heaven
overshadows
you
my
cousin
poor
mowbray
would
have
rejoiced
exceedingly
had
it
been
possible
for
her
kind
and
adviser
and
friend
to
accompany
her
to
london
but
as
he
did
not
himself
propose
this
she
would
not
venture
to
do
it
and
only
asked
him
such
as
an
obedient
child
might
ask
a
parent
whether
he
thought
she
ought
to
go
attended
only
by
a
man
and
maid
servant
or
whether
she
might
have
the
comfort
of
taking
one
of
her
daughters
with
her
cartwright
looked
puzzled
indeed
the
question
involved
considerable
difficulties
it
was
by
no
means
the
vicar
wish
to
appear
harsh
or
disagreeable
in
his
enactments
yet
neither
did
he
particularly
desire
that
the
eldest
miss
mowbray
should
be
placed
in
circumstances
likely
to
give
her
increased
influence
over
her
mother
and
as
to
fanny
his
conscience
reproached
him
for
having
for
an
instant
conceived
the
idea
of
permitting
one
to
whom
the
elective
finger
of
grace
had
so
recently
pointed
to
be
removed
so
far
from
his
fostering
care
after
a
few
moments
of
silent
consideration
he
replied
no
my
dearest
lady
you
ought
not
to
be
without
the
soothing
presence
of
a
child
and
if
i
might
advise
you
on
the
subject
i
should
recommend
your
being
accompanied
by
miss
helen
both
because
as
being
the
eldest
she
might
expect
this
preference
and
because
likewise
i
should
deem
it
prudent
to
remove
her
from
the
great
risk
and
danger
of
falling
into
the
society
of
your
base
and
injurious
enemy
during
your
absence
you
are
quite
right
about
that
as
i
sure
you
are
about
every
thing
cartwright
i
really
would
not
have
helen
see
more
of
sir
family
for
the
world
she
has
such
wild
romantic
notions
about
old
friendships
being
better
than
new
ones
that
i
am
sure
it
would
be
the
way
to
make
terrible
disputes
between
us
she
has
never
yet
known
the
misery
of
having
an
old
friend
turn
against
her
nor
the
comfort
cartwright
of
finding
a
new
one
sent
by
providence
to
supply
his
place
my
dearest
lady
i
shall
ever
praise
and
bless
the
dispensation
that
has
placed
me
near
you
during
this
great
trial
and
remember
always
that
those
whom
the
lord
loveth
he
chasteneth
ah
cartwright
i
fear
that
i
have
not
been
hitherto
sufficiently
mindful
of
this
and
that
i
have
repined
where
i
ought
to
have
blessed
but
i
trust
that
a
more
christian
spirit
is
now
awakened
within
me
and
that
henceforward
with
your
aid
and
by
the
blessing
of
heaven
upon
my
humble
endeavours
i
may
become
worthy
of
the
privilege
i
enjoy
as
being
one
of
your
congregation
may
the
lord
hear
receive
record
and
bless
that
hope
cried
the
vicar
fervently
seizing
her
hand
and
kissing
it
with
holy
zeal
mowbray
coloured
slightly
but
feeling
ashamed
of
the
weak
and
unworthy
feeling
that
caused
this
she
made
a
strong
effort
to
recover
from
the
sort
of
embarrassment
his
action
caused
and
said
with
as
much
ease
as
she
could
assume
rosalind
and
fanny
are
both
very
young
and
very
giddy
cartwright
may
i
hope
that
during
my
short
absence
which
i
shall
make
as
short
as
possible
may
i
hope
my
kind
friend
that
you
will
look
in
upon
them
every
day
you
can
not
doubt
it
what
is
there
i
would
not
do
to
spare
you
an
anxious
thought
they
are
young
and
thoughtless
particularly
your
ward
miss
torrington
is
just
the
girl
i
think
to
propose
some
wild
frolic
perhaps
another
visit
to
sir
gilbert
and
your
sweet
fanny
is
too
young
and
has
too
little
authority
to
prevent
it
good
heaven
do
you
think
so
then
what
can
i
do
an
idea
has
struck
me
my
dear
friend
which
i
will
mention
to
you
with
all
frankness
certain
that
if
you
disapprove
it
you
will
tell
me
so
with
an
openness
and
sincerity
equal
to
my
i
think
that
if
my
staid
and
quiet
daughter
henrietta
were
to
pass
the
short
interval
of
your
absence
here
you
might
be
quite
sure
that
nothing
gay
or
giddy
would
be
done
her
delicate
health
and
sober
turn
of
mind
preclude
the
possibility
of
this
and
her
being
here
would
authorize
my
daily
visit
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
i
should
like
so
well
replied
mowbray
any
thing
likely
to
promote
an
intimacy
between
my
young
people
and
a
daughter
brought
up
by
you
must
be
indeed
a
blessing
to
us
shall
i
call
upon
her
or
shall
i
write
the
invitation
you
are
very
kind
dear
lady
very
but
there
is
no
sort
of
necessity
that
you
should
take
the
trouble
of
doing
either
i
will
mention
to
henrietta
your
most
flattering
wish
that
she
should
be
here
during
your
absence
and
believe
me
she
will
be
most
happy
to
comply
with
it
i
shall
be
very
grateful
to
but
will
it
not
be
more
agreeable
for
her
and
for
us
also
that
she
should
come
immediately
i
can
not
go
before
monday
this
is
thursday
might
she
not
come
to
us
how
thoughtful
is
that
how
like
yourself
certainly
it
will
be
pleasanter
for
her
and
i
will
therefore
bring
her
the
conversation
was
here
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
a
servant
with
a
note
but
for
the
better
understanding
its
effect
both
on
the
lady
and
gentleman
it
will
be
necessary
to
recount
one
or
two
circumstances
which
had
occurred
to
the
party
in
the
mowbray
family
subsequent
to
their
visit
to
oakley
a
few
days
after
that
which
witnessed
poor
helen
disgrace
after
entering
the
and
receiving
a
hint
from
her
mother
whom
she
found
there
in
close
conclave
with
the
vicar
that
she
had
better
take
her
morning
walk
it
happened
that
she
and
rosalind
as
they
were
earnestly
discoursing
of
their
yesterday
visit
and
enjoying
the
perfect
shade
of
a
lane
leading
to
the
village
of
wrexhill
perceived
a
horseman
approaching
them
as
slowly
as
it
was
possible
to
make
a
fine
horse
walk
in
the
next
moment
however
something
appeared
to
have
pricked
the
sides
of
his
intent
as
well
as
those
of
his
horse
for
with
a
bound
or
two
he
was
close
to
them
and
in
the
next
instant
dismounted
and
by
their
side
the
gentleman
proved
to
be
colonel
harrington
who
immediately
declared
with
very
soldierly
frankness
that
he
had
been
riding
through
every
avenue
leading
to
mowbray
park
in
the
hope
of
being
fortunate
enough
to
meet
them
rosalind
smiled
while
helen
without
knowing
too
well
what
she
said
answered
with
a
deep
blush
you
are
very
kind
colonel
harrington
carefully
tied
up
his
reins
and
so
arranged
them
as
to
leave
no
danger
of
their
getting
loose
then
giving
his
steed
a
slight
cut
with
his
the
obedient
animal
set
off
at
an
easy
trot
for
oakley
he
knows
his
way
at
least
as
well
as
i
do
said
the
colonel
it
is
my
father
old
hunter
and
i
selected
him
on
purpose
that
if
i
were
lucky
enough
to
meet
you
i
might
have
no
trouble
about
getting
rid
of
him
and
now
tell
me
helen
how
did
your
mother
bear
the
answer
my
father
sent
to
her
note
an
answer
from
sir
gilbert
and
to
a
note
from
my
mother
said
helen
alas
it
was
kept
secret
from
me
and
therefore
colonel
harrington
i
had
rather
you
should
not
talk
of
it
to
me
it
is
hardly
reasonable
that
you
should
insist
upon
my
keeping
secret
what
i
have
to
tell
you
helen
because
others
are
less
communicative
the
letters
he
receives
and
writes
are
surely
my
father
business
either
to
impart
or
conceal
as
he
thinks
best
and
he
is
extremely
anxious
to
learn
your
opinion
respecting
your
mother
letter
and
his
answer
to
it
he
certainly
did
not
imagine
that
they
had
been
kept
secret
from
you
indeed
i
have
never
heard
of
either
do
you
suppose
then
that
she
has
mentioned
them
to
no
one
helen
did
not
immediately
reply
but
rosalind
did
i
am
very
particularly
mistaken
colonel
harrington
said
she
if
the
reverend
william
jacob
cartwright
vicar
of
wrexhill
and
privy
counsellor
at
mowbray
park
did
not
superintend
the
writing
of
the
one
and
the
reading
of
the
other
do
you
really
think
so
miss
torrington
what
do
you
say
helen
do
you
believe
this
to
have
been
the
case
he
is
very
often
at
the
park
replied
helen
but
do
you
think
it
possible
that
mowbray
would
communicate
to
him
what
she
would
conceal
from
you
said
colonel
harrington
this
question
was
also
left
unanswered
by
helen
but
rosalind
again
undertook
to
reply
you
will
think
me
a
very
interfering
person
i
am
afraid
colonel
harrington
said
she
but
many
feelings
keep
helen
silent
which
do
not
influence
me
and
as
far
as
i
am
capable
of
judging
it
is
extremely
proper
and
perhaps
important
that
sir
gilbert
should
know
that
this
holy
vicar
never
passes
a
day
without
finding
or
making
an
excuse
for
calling
at
the
park
i
can
hardly
tell
how
it
is
but
it
certainly
does
happen
that
these
visits
generally
take
place
when
we
that
is
helen
and
i
are
not
in
the
house
but
to
confess
my
sins
and
make
a
clear
breast
at
once
i
will
tell
you
what
i
have
never
yet
told
helen
and
that
is
that
i
have
ordered
my
maid
to
find
out
if
she
can
when
cartwright
comes
he
slipped
in
however
through
the
library
window
twice
yesterday
so
it
is
possible
that
he
may
sometimes
make
good
an
entry
without
being
observed
for
it
is
impossible
that
my
judy
can
be
always
on
the
watch
though
she
is
so
fond
of
performing
her
needlework
in
that
pretty
trellised
in
the
park
what
an
excellent
vidette
you
would
make
miss
torrington
said
the
young
man
laughing
but
will
you
tell
me
sincerely
and
without
any
shadow
of
jesting
why
it
is
that
you
have
been
so
anxious
to
watch
the
movements
of
this
reverend
gentleman
if
i
talk
on
the
subject
at
all
she
replied
it
will
certainly
be
without
any
propensity
to
jesting
for
i
have
seldom
felt
less
inclined
to
be
merry
than
while
watching
the
increasing
influence
of
cartwright
over
mowbray
and
fanny
it
was
because
i
remarked
that
they
never
mentioned
his
having
called
when
i
knew
he
had
been
there
that
i
grew
anxious
to
learn
if
possible
how
constant
his
visits
had
become
and
the
result
of
my
is
that
no
day
passes
without
a
visit
but
what
makes
you
speak
of
this
as
of
an
evil
miss
torrington
that
is
more
than
i
have
promised
to
tell
you
replied
rosalind
but
as
we
become
so
very
confidential
i
have
no
objection
to
tell
you
all
and
that
remember
for
the
especial
use
of
sir
gilbert
who
perhaps
if
he
knew
all
that
i
guess
would
think
he
was
doing
right
to
leave
mowbray
in
such
hands
and
what
then
miss
torrington
is
there
you
against
this
gentleman
rosalind
for
an
instant
looked
puzzled
but
by
the
rapidity
with
which
she
proceeded
after
she
began
the
difficulty
seemed
to
arise
solely
from
not
knowing
what
to
say
first
there
is
against
him
said
she
the
having
hurried
away
from
hearing
the
will
read
to
the
presence
of
mowbray
and
not
only
announcing
its
contents
to
her
with
what
might
well
be
called
indecent
haste
considering
that
there
were
others
to
whom
the
task
more
fitly
belonged
and
who
would
have
performed
it
too
had
they
not
been
thus
forestalled
not
only
did
he
do
this
but
he
basely
and
i
do
believe
most
falsely
gave
her
to
understand
that
her
son
the
generous
disinterested
charles
mowbray
had
manifested
displeasure
at
it
further
he
has
turned
the
head
of
poor
little
fanny
by
begging
copies
of
her
verses
to
send
heaven
knows
where
and
he
moreover
has
i
am
sure
persuaded
mowbray
to
think
that
my
peerless
helen
is
in
fault
for
something
heaven
knows
what
he
has
likewise
as
your
account
of
those
secret
letters
renders
certain
dared
to
step
between
an
affectionate
mother
and
her
devoted
child
to
destroy
their
dear
and
close
union
by
hateful
and
poisonous
mystery
he
has
also
fomented
the
unhappy
and
most
silly
schism
between
your
pettish
father
and
my
petted
guardian
and
moreover
with
all
his
beauty
and
benignity
of
aspect
his
soft
crafty
eyes
dare
not
look
me
in
the
face
and
twelfthly
and
lastly
i
hate
him
after
this
miss
torrington
said
the
colonel
laughing
no
man
assuredly
could
be
sufficiently
hardy
to
say
a
word
in
his
defence
and
all
jesting
apart
he
added
very
seriously
i
do
think
you
have
made
out
a
very
strong
case
against
him
if
my
good
father
sees
this
growing
intimacy
between
the
vicarage
and
the
park
with
the
same
feelings
that
you
do
i
really
think
it
might
go
farther
than
any
other
consideration
towards
inducing
him
to
rescind
his
refusal
for
he
positively
refused
to
act
as
executor
and
lead
him
at
once
and
for
ever
to
forget
the
unreasonable
cause
of
anger
he
has
conceived
against
your
mother
helen
then
let
him
know
it
without
an
hour
delay
said
helen
dear
colonel
harrington
why
did
you
let
your
horse
go
walk
you
must
but
let
it
be
as
fast
as
you
can
and
let
your
father
understand
exactly
every
thing
that
rosalind
has
told
you
for
though
i
should
hardly
have
ventured
to
say
as
much
myself
i
own
that
i
think
she
is
not
much
mistaken
in
any
of
her
conclusions
and
do
you
follow
her
helen
up
to
her
twelfthly
and
lastly
do
you
too
this
reverend
gentleman
helen
sighed
i
hope
not
colonel
harrington
she
replied
i
should
be
sorry
to
believe
myself
capable
of
hating
but
surely
i
do
not
love
him
the
young
ladies
in
their
eagerness
to
set
the
colonel
off
on
his
road
to
oakley
were
unconsciously
or
rather
most
obliviously
guilty
of
the
indecorum
of
accompanying
him
at
least
half
the
distance
and
at
last
it
was
rosalind
and
not
the
much
more
shy
and
timid
helen
who
became
aware
of
the
singularity
of
the
proceeding
and
where
may
be
going
i
should
like
to
know
she
said
suddenly
stopping
short
helen
is
it
the
fashion
for
the
hampshire
ladies
to
escort
home
the
gentlemen
they
chance
to
meet
in
their
walks
we
never
do
that
in
my
country
colonel
harrington
looked
positively
angry
and
helen
blushed
celestial
rosy
red
but
soon
recovered
herself
and
said
with
that
species
of
frankness
which
at
once
disarms
quizzing
it
is
very
true
rosalind
we
seem
to
be
doing
a
very
strange
thing
but
we
have
had
a
great
deal
to
say
that
was
really
important
yet
nothing
so
much
so
as
leading
colonel
harrington
to
his
father
with
as
little
delay
as
but
now
i
think
we
have
said
all
colonel
harrington
i
need
not
tell
you
how
grateful
we
shall
all
be
if
you
can
persuade
sir
gilbert
to
restore
us
all
to
favour
the
all
is
but
one
helen
but
the
doing
so
i
now
feel
to
be
very
important
farewell
take
care
of
yourselves
for
i
will
not
vex
you
helen
by
turning
back
again
farewell
the
letter
which
interrupted
the
between
mowbray
and
the
vicar
was
an
immediate
consequence
of
this
conversation
and
was
as
follows
madam
upon
a
maturer
consideration
of
the
possible
effects
to
the
family
of
my
late
friend
which
my
refusal
to
act
as
his
executor
may
produce
i
am
willing
notwithstanding
my
repugnance
to
the

to
perform
the
duties
of
it
and
hereby
desire
to
revoke
my
late
refusal

do

thank
heaven
exclaimed
mowbray
as
soon
as
she
had
read
the
note
thank
heaven
that
i
have
no
longer
any
occasion
to
submit
myself
to
the
caprices
of
any
man
and
yet
she
added
putting
the
paper
into
cartwright
hands
i
suppose
it
will
be
best
for
me
to
accept
his
reluctant
and
ungracious
offer
cartwright
took
the
paper
and
perused
it
with
great
attention
and
more
than
once
at
length
he
said
i
trust
i
did
not
understand
you
what
was
it
you
said
dearest
mowbray
respecting
this
most
insulting
communication
i
hardly
know
cartwright
what
i
said
replied
mowbray
colouring
how
can
i
know
what
to
say
to
a
person
who
can
treat
a
woman
in
my
painful
situation
with
such
cruel
caprice
such
unfeeling
inconsistency
were
i
you
my
valued
friend
i
should
make
the
matter
very
easy
for
i
should
say
nothing
to
him
nothing
do
you
mean
that
you
would
not
answer
the
letter
certainly
that
is
what
i
should
recommend
as
the
only
mode
of
noticing
it
consistently
with
the
respect
you
owe
yourself
i
am
sure
you
are
quite
right
replied
mowbray
looking
relieved
from
a
load
of
difficulty
it
certainly
does
not
deserve
an
answer
said
she
and
i
am
sure
i
should
not
in
the
least
know
what
to
say
to
him
then
let
us
treat
the
scroll
as
it
does
deserve
to
be
treated
said
the
vicar
with
a
smile
let
the
indignant
wind
bear
it
back
to
the
face
of
the
and
insulting
writer
and
so
saying
he
eagerly
tore
the
paper
into
minute
atoms
and
appeared
about
to
consign
them
to
the
conveyance
he
mentioned
but
suddenly
checked
himself
and
with
thoughtful
consideration
for
the
gardener
added
but
no
we
will
not
disfigure
your
beautiful
lawn
by
casting
these
fragments
upon
it
i
will
dispose
of
them
on
the
other

chapter
xiii
mowbray
departure
for
an
extemporary
prayer
it
was
about
nine
in
the
evening
of
this
same
day
that
cartwright
was
seen
approaching
across
the
lawn
towards
the
windows
and
that
not
only
by
judy
but
by
the
whole
family
who
were
assembled
there
and
preparing
to
take
their
tea
his
daughter
henrietta
was
on
his
arm
yet
still
she
rather
followed
than
walked
with
him
so
evidently
did
she
hang
back
while
he
as
evidently
endeavoured
to
quicken
his
pace
and
draw
her
forward
the
eyes
of
the
whole
party
were
attracted
to
the
windows
mowbray
and
fanny
approaching
different
sashes
each
stepped
out
to
welcome
them
while
miss
torrington
and
helen
were
content
to
watch
the
meeting
from
their
places
on
a
sofa
did
you
ever
see
a
man
drive
a
pig
to
market
helen
said
rosalind
in
my
country
they
do
it
so
much
more
cleverly
for
look
you
if
that
man
were
half
as
clever
as
he
thinks
himself
he
would
just
go
behind
the
young
lady
and
pull
her
backwards
i
am
not
quite
sure
that
the
scheme
would
answer
in
this
case
replied
helen
look
at
the
expression
of
her
face
and
i
think
you
will
perceive
that
nothing
but
a
very
straightforward
pull
could
induce
her
to
approach
at
all
perhaps
she
is
disgusted
at
her
odious
father
presumption
and
forwardness
cried
rosalind
starting
up
if
that
be
so
i
will
patronise
poor
thing
look
at
her
eyes
i
am
positive
she
has
been
weeping
with
this
impression
miss
torrington
stepped
forward
and
as
the
party
entered
greeted
the
young
lady
very
kindly
though
she
hardly
appeared
to
perceive
that
her
father
entered
with
her
she
received
in
return
a
look
which
with
all
her
acuteness
she
found
it
extremely
difficult
to
interpret
there
was
a
strong
and
obvious
expression
of
surprise
in
it
and
then
in
the
faint
attempt
at
a
smile
about
the
corners
of
the
mouth
which
attempt
however
was
finally
abortive
rosalind
fancied
that
she
traced
a
movement
of
gratitude
though
not
of
pleasure
but
over
every
feature
a
settled
gloom
seemed
to
hang
like
a
dark
veil
obscuring
though
not
quite
hiding
every
emotion
the
difficulty
of
understanding
why
and
wherefore
she
looked
as
she
did
was
quite
enough
with
such
a
disposition
as
rosalind
to
make
her
an
object
of
interest
and
therefore
when
mowbray
made
her
the
speech
that
she
was
expressly
brought
to
hear
expressive
of
hope
that
she
would
have
the
great
kindness
to
console
that
part
of
her
family
who
were
to
remain
at
home
by
affording
them
the
pleasure
of
her
company
rosalind
relieved
her
from
the
immediate
necessity
of
replying
by
saying
gaily
she
will
and
she
must
mowbray
for
we
will
take
her
prisoner
but
i
will
promise
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
that
her
durance
shall
be
as
gentle
as
possible
it
was
now
the
vicar
turn
to
look
astonished
which
he
certainly
did
in
no
small
degree
and
ran
some
risk
of
destroying
the
favourable
impression
which
his
daughter
look
of
misery
had
created
by
saying
in
the
sweet
tone
that
miss
torrington
relished
so
little
henrietta
my
love
i
trust
you
will
be
sensible
of
and
grateful
for
the
amiable
and
condescending
kindness
of
this
young
lady
what
the
gloomy
henrietta
answered
rosalind
did
not
stay
to
hear
for
by
a
movement
of
that
impatience
with
which
she
always
listened
to
all
that
cartwright
spoke
she
turned
from
him
and
walked
out
of
the
window
she
only
stayed
however
long
enough
to
gather
a
bunch
of
geranium
blossoms
which
she
put
into
the
hand
of
henrietta
as
she
placed
herself
beside
her
on
are
they
not
superb
miss
cartwright
miss
cartwright
again
answered
by
a
look
which
once
more
set
all
rosalind
ingenuity
at
defiance
it
now
spoke
awakened
interest
and
an
almost
eager
desire
to
look
at
and
listen
to
her
but
the
heavy
gloom
remained
while
her
almost
total
silence
gave
her
an
appearance
of
reserve
greatly
at
variance
with
the
expression
which
for
a
moment
at
least
she
had
read
in
her
eyes
helen
was
now
in
full
assembly
informed
for
the
first
time
that
she
was
to
attend
her
mother
to
town
had
this
been
told
her
as
every
thing
was
wont
to
be
in
the
dear
seclusion
of
her
mother
she
would
have
hailed
the
news
with
joy
and
gratitude
and
believed
that
it
predicted
a
return
of
all
the
happiness
she
had
lost
but
now
the
effect
was
wholly
different
and
though
she
mastered
herself
sufficiently
to
send
back
the
tears
before
they
reached
her
eyes
and
to
declare
in
the
gentle
voice
of
genuine
unaffected
obedience
that
she
should
be
delighted
if
she
could
be
useful
to
her
the
manner
of
the
communication
sank
deeply
and
painfully
into
her
heart
an
answer
having
arrived
by
return
of
post
from
stephen
corbold
solicitor
stating
that
commodious
apartments
were
secured
in
and
himself
ready
body
and
spirit
to
do
the
bidding
mowbray
fixed
on
the
following
day
for
her
journey
miss
cartwright
gave
one
mutter
beyond
a
tacit
consent
to
remain
at
the
park
during
her
absence
and
the
party
separated
fanny
however
declaring
as
she
wrapped
a
shawl
of
her
mother
about
her
head
that
she
must
enjoy
the
delicious
moonlight
by
accompanying
the
vicar
and
his
daughter
as
far
as
the
park
gates
and
return
alone
fanny
said
her
mother
why
not
dear
lady
replied
cartwright
her
eye
will
not
be
raised
to
the
lamp
of
night
without
her
heart
rising
also
in
a
hymn
to
her
lord
and
saviour
and
i
am
willing
to
believe
that
her
remaining
for
a
few
moments
beside
her
pastor
and
her
friend
while
under
its
soft
influence
will
not
be
likely
to
make
her
thoughts
wander
in
a
wrong
direction
oh
no
cartwright
replied
the
mother
i
am
sure
if
you
think
it
right
she
shall
go
at
this
moment
miss
torrington
was
giving
a
farewell
shake
of
the
hand
to
henrietta
when
instead
of
receiving
from
her
an
answering
good
night
something
very
like
a
groan
smote
her
ear
how
very
strange
she
exclaimed
aloud
after
a
silence
that
lasted
till
the
vicar
with
fanny
leaning
on
his
arm
and
his
sulky
daughter
following
had
half
traversed
the
lawn
towards
the
gate
that
opened
upon
the
drive
what
is
strange
miss
torrington
said
mowbray
almost
every
thing
i
see
and
hear
replied
the
young
lady
at
what
hour
are
we
to
set
off
mamma
inquired
helen
at
ten
my
dear
you
had
better
give
your
orders
to
curtis
helen
as
to
what
she
is
to
put
up
for
you
i
hope
we
shall
not
be
obliged
to
remain
in
town
above
two
or
three
days
if
you
have
any
thing
to
do
in
your
room
helen
it
is
time
to
betake
yourself
to
it
observed
rosalind
for
looking
at
her
watch
it
is
very
near
midnight
though
miss
fanny
mowbray
is
walking
in
the
good
night
mrs
mowbray
but
mowbray
did
not
appear
to
hear
her
good
night
mamma
said
helen
approaching
to
kiss
her
she
received
a
very
cold
salute
upon
her
forehead
and
a
good
night
helen
in
a
tone
that
answered
to
it
rosalind
took
the
arm
of
her
friend
within
hers
as
they
left
the
room
together
and
a
silent
pressure
spoke
her
sympathy
but
neither
of
them
uttered
a
word
that
night
either
concerning
cartwright
increasing
influence
or
mowbray
continued
coldness
to
helen
they
both
of
them
felt
more
than
they
wished
to
speak
the
following
morning
brought
cartwright
and
his
daughter
again
to
the
park
a
few
minutes
before
the
arrived
for
carriage
and
in
a
few
minutes
more
every
thing
was
ready
for
the
departure
of
the
travellers
helen
gave
a
farewell
embrace
to
fanny
and
rosalind
while
the
attentive
vicar
stepped
into
the
carriage
before
mowbray
entered
it
to
see
that
as
many
windows
were
up
and
as
many
windows
down
as
she
wished
and
likewise
for
the
purpose
of
placing
a
small
volume
in
the
side
pocket
next
the
place
she
was
to
occupy
he
then
returned
to
her
side
and
as
he
handed
her
in
whispered
while
he
pressed
her
hand
do
not
fatigue
yourself
with
talking
my
dear
friend
it
is
a
great
while
since
you
have
taken
a
journey
even
so
long
as
this
in
the
pocket
next
you
i
have
placed
a
little
volume
that
i
wish
oh
how
ardently
that
you
would
read
with
attention
will
you
promise
me
this
i
will
replied
mowbray
deeply
affected
by
his
earnestness
god
bless
you
the
lord
watch
over
you
responded
cartwright
with
a
sigh
he
then
retreated
a
step
and
helen
sprang
hastily
into
the
carriage
without
assistance
the
door
was
closed
and
before
the
equipage
reached
the
lodges
mowbray
had
plunged
into
a
disquisition
on
regeneration
and
faith
the
glory
of
the
new
birth
and
the
assured
damnation
of
all
who
can
not
or
do
not
attain
thereto
meanwhile
the
party
left
under
the
shade
of
the
portico
looked
at
each
other
as
if
to
inquire
what
they
were
to
do
next
on
all
occasions
of
morning
departure
there
is
generally
a
certain
degree
of
left
with
those
who
remain
behind
in
general
however
this
is
soon
got
over
except
by
a
desperate
idler
or
a
very
mournful
residuary
guest
but
on
the
present
occasion
the
usual
occupations
of
the
parties
were
put
completely
out
of
joint
and
rosalind
at
least
was
exceedingly
well
disposed
to
exclaim
accursed
spite
that
ever
i
was
born
to
set
it
right
she
remained
stationary
for
a
few
minutes
hoping
and
expecting
that
the
reverend
gentleman
would
depart
but
as
this
did
not
happen
she
quietly
the
house
and
retired
to
her
own
fanny
then
made
a
motion
to
enter
also
but
took
very
hospitable
care
that
it
should
include
both
her
companions
cartwright
spoke
not
of
going
he
even
led
the
way
to
the
library
himself
and
having
closed
the
door
and
put
down
the
sash
windows
he
turned
to
fanny
and
with
a
smile
that
might
have
accompanied
a
proposal
to
sing
or
dance
said
my
dear
miss
fanny
does
not
your
heart
feel
full
of
kind
and
tender
wishes
for
the
safety
of
your
beloved
mother
during
her
absence
from
you
it
does
indeed
said
fanny
shaking
back
her
chesnut
ringlets
then
should
we
not
rejoined
the
vicar
assisting
her
action
by
gently
putting
back
her
redundant
curls
with
his
own
hand
should
we
not
my
dear
child
implore
a
blessing
upon
her
from
the
only
source
from
whence
it
can
come
oh
yes
replied
fanny
with
affectionate
earnestness
but
by
no
means
understanding
his
immediate
purpose
oh
yes
cartwright
i
am
sure
i
never
pray
so
heartily
as
when
praying
for
mamma
then
let
us
kneel
said
he
placing
a
chair
before
her
and
kneeling
down
himself
at
the
one
that
was
next
to
it
fanny
instantly
obeyed
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
while
her
young
heart
beat
with
a
timid
and
most
truly
pious
feeling
of
fear
lest
the
act
was
not
performed
with
suitable
deference
for
hitherto
her
private
devotions
had
been
performed
in
strict
obedience
to
the
solemn
and
explicit
words
of
scripture
thou
prayest
enter
into
thy
closet
and
when
thou
hast
shut
thy
door
pray
to
thy
father
which
is
in
secret
and
thy
father
which
seeth
in
secret
shall
reward
thee
but
though
conscious
that
the
mode
of
prayer
in
which
she
was
now
so
unexpectedly
invited
to
join
was
very
unlike
what
she
was
used
to
her
unbounded
love
and
admiration
for
cartwright
rendered
it
absolutely
impossible
for
her
to
conceive
it
wrong
and
she
prepared
herself
to
pray
with
all
the
fervour
of
her
young
and
ardent
spirit
there
was
a
moment
pause
during
which
a
look
was
exchanged
between
the
father
and
daughter
unseen
by
fanny
but
had
it
met
her
eye
it
would
only
have
appeared
to
her
as
a
mystery
that
she
was
incapable
of
comprehending
had
rosalind
caught
a
sight
of
it
she
might
perhaps
have
fancied
that
the
glance
of
the
father
spoke
command
accompanied
by
direful
threatenings
while
that
of
his
daughter
betrayed
disgust
and
bitterest
contempt
mingled
with
fear
cartwright
began
almost
in
a
whisper
to
utter
his
extemporary
prayer
it
first
invoked
a
blessing
on
little
knot
of
united
that
now
offered
their
homage
and
then
proceeded
to
ask
in
flowing
periods
for
exemption
from
all
dangers
likely
to
beset
travellers
by
land
for
our
beloved
sister
who
is
this
day
gone
forth
in
a
tone
somewhat
more
loud
he
went
on
to
implore
especial
grace
for
the
not
yet
awakened
soul
of
the
child
she
led
with
her
and
then
his
rich
and
powerful
voice
resounding
through
the
room
his
eyes
raised
to
the
ceiling
and
his
clasped
and
extended
hands
stretched
out
before
him
he
burst
into
an
ecstasy
of
enthusiastic
rantings
in
which
he
besought
blessings
on
the
head
of
fanny
it
is
impossible
to
repeat
such
language
as
cartwright
and
those
who
resemble
him
think
fit
to
use
in
their
extemporary
devotions
without
offending
against
that
sensitive
horror
of
profanation
which
happily
still
continues
to
be
one
of
the
strongest
feelings
in
the
minds
of
christians
not
converted
perverted
from
the
solemn
reverence
our
church
enjoins
in
the
utterance
of
every
word
by
which
we
venture
to
approach
the
deity
to
such
the
unweighed
flippant
use
of
those
momentous
words
let
us
pray
followed
as
they
often
are
by
turgid
rantings
and
familiar
appeals
to
the
most
high
god
in
volumes
of
rapid
careless
wordiness
is
perhaps
the
most
offensive
outrage
to
which
their
religions
feelings
can
be
exposed
one
might
be
almost
tempted
to
believe
that
the
sectarians
who
rejecting
the
authorized
forms
in
which
the
bishops
and
fathers
of
our
church
have
cautiously
reverently
and
succinctly
rehearsed
the
petitions
which
the
scriptures
permit
man
to
offer
to
his
creator
one
might
i
say
almost
be
tempted
to
believe
that
these
men
have
so
misunderstood
the
word
of
god
as
to
read
use
repetitions
as
the
heathen
do
for
shall
be
for
their
much
but
this
much
speaking
with
all
its
irreverent
accompaniments
of
familiar
phraseology
is
an
abomination
to
those
who
have
preserved
their
right
to
sit
within
the
sacred
pale
of
our
established
church
and
as
it
is
among
such
that
i
wish
to
find
my
readers
i
will
avoid
as
much
as
possible
offending
them
by
unnecessary
repetitions
of
cartwright
rhapsodies
preserving
only
so
much
of
their
substance
as
may
be
necessary
to
the
making
his
character
fully
understood
while
imploring
heaven
to
soften
the
heart
of
poor
fanny
who
knelt
weeping
beside
him
like
a
niobe
he
rehearsed
her
talents
and
good
qualities
earnestly
praying
that
they
might
not
be
turned
by
the
prince
of
darkness
into
a
snare
let
not
her
gift
her
shining
gift
of
poesy
lead
her
as
it
has
so
often
done
others
to
the
deepest
pit
of
hell
let
not
the
gentle
and
warm
affections
of
her
heart
cling
to
those
that
shall
carry
her
soul
with
their
own
down
to
the
worm
that
dieth
not
and
to
the
fire
that
can
not
be
quenched
rather
fix
thou
her
love
upon
those
who
will
seek
it
in
thy
holy
name
may
she
know
to
distinguish
between
the
true
and
the
false
the
holy
and
the
unholy
amen
was
here
uttered
by
henrietta
but
in
so
low
a
whisper
that
only
her
father
ear
caught
it
he
paused
for
half
a
moment
and
then
continued
with
zeal
so
that
his
voice
shook
and
tears
fell
from
his
eyes
fanny
was
fully
aware
of
all
this
strong
emotion
for
though
she
uncovered
not
her
own
streaming
eyes
she
could
not
mistake
the
trembling
voice
that
pronounced
its
fervent
blessing
on
her
amidst
sobs
meanwhile
miss
torrington
who
had
seated
herself
before
a
book
in
her
began
to
think
that
she
was
not
acting
very
kindly
towards
fanny
who
she
knew
was
so
nearly
childish
in
her
manners
as
to
render
the
entertaining
company
a
very
disagreeable
task
to
her
poor
little
soul
she
exclaimed
between
the
manna
of
the
father
and
the
crabbishness
of
the
daughter
she
will
be
done
to
death
if
i
go
not
to
her
rescue
so
she
closed
her
book
and
hastened
to
the
library
the
sound
she
heard
on
approaching
the
door
startled
her
and
she
paused
to
listen
a
moment
before
she
entered
for
not
having
the
remotest
idea
that
it
was
the
voice
of
prayer
she
really
believed
that
some
one
had
been
taken
ill
and
the
notion
of
convulsions
blended
with
the
recollection
of
henrietta
sickly
appearance
took
possession
of
her
fancy
she
determined
however
to
enter
but
turned
the
lock
with
a
very
nervous
hand
and
on
beholding
the
scene
which
the
opening
door
displayed
felt
startled
awed
and
uncertain
whether
to
advance
or
retreat
she
immediately
met
henrietta
eye
which
turned
towards
her
as
she
opened
the
door
and
its
expression
at
once
explained
the
nature
of
the
ceremony
she
so
unexpectedly
witnessed
contempt
and
bitter
scorn
shot
from
it
as
she
slowly
turned
it
towards
her
father
and
a
smile
of
pity
succeeded
as
she
mournfully
shook
her
head
when
for
a
moment
she
fixed
her
glance
upon
the
figure
of
fanny
had
the
poor
girl
for
whose
especial
sake
this
very
unclerical
rhapsody
was
uttered
had
she
been
a
few
years
older
and
somewhat
more
advanced
in
the
power
of
judging
human
actions
she
must
have
been
struck
by
the
remarkable
change
which
the
entrance
of
rosalind
produced
in
the
language
and
manner
of
the
vicar
he
did
not
for
an
instant
suspend
the
flow
of
his
eloquence
but
the
style
of
it
altered
altogether
bless
her
bless
this
lovely
and
beloved
one
were
the
words
which
preceded
the
opening
of
the
door
accompanied
by
the
sobbings
of
vehement
bless
all
this
worthy
family
and
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
men
and
so
lead
them
home
were
those
which
followed
uttered
too
with
very
decent
sobriety
and
discretion
rosalind
however
was
not
quite
deceived
by
this
though
far
from
guessing
how
perfectly
indecent
and
profane
had
been
the
impassioned
language
and
vehement
emotion
which
preceded
her
appearance
after
the
hesitation
of
a
moment
she
closed
the
door
and
walking
up
to
the
side
of
fanny
stood
beside
her
for
the
minute
and
a
half
which
it
took
cartwright
to
bring
his
harangue
to
a
conclusion
he
then
ceased
rose
from
his
knees
and
bowed
to
the
intruder
with
an
air
so
meek
and
sanctified
but
yet
with
such
a
downcast
avoidance
of
her
eye
withal
that
rosalind
shrank
from
him
with
dislike
and
would
instantly
have
left
the
room
but
that
she
did
not
choose
again
to
leave
fanny
who
still
continued
kneeling
beside
her
to
a
repetition
of
the
scene
she
had
interrupted
fanny
she
said
in
an
accent
a
little
approaching
to
impatience
but
fanny
heeded
her
not
vexed
and
disgusted
at
this
display
of
a
devotion
so
unlike
the
genuine
unaffected
piety
in
which
she
had
been
herself
brought
up
she
repeated
her
call
adding
as
she
laid
her
hand
lightly
on
her
shoulder
this
is
not
the
sort
of
worship
which
your
excellent
father
or
good
wallace
either
would
have
approved
fanny
now
rose
from
her
knees
and
the
cause
of
her
not
doing
so
before
became
evident
her
face
was
as
pale
as
ashes
and
traces
of
violent
weeping
were
visible
on
her
swollen
eyelids
good
heaven
fanny
what
can
have
affected
you
thus
what
sir
have
you
been
saying
to
produce
so
terrible
an
effect
on
miss
mowbray
the
prayers
of
the
church
in
the
discipline
of
which
she
has
been
most
carefully
bred
up
produce
no
such
paroxysms
as
these
mr
come
with
me
fanny
and
do
endeavour
to
conquer
this
extraordinary
vehemence
of
emotion
fanny
took
her
arm
but
she
trembled
so
violently
that
she
could
scarcely
stand
cartwright
said
rosalind
with
a
burst
of
indignation
that
she
could
not
control
i
must
beg
of
you
not
to
repeat
this
species
of
experiment
on
the
feelings
of
this
young
lady
during
the
absence
of
her
mother
at
her
return
she
will
of
course
decide
upon
your
continuance
or
discontinuance
in
the
office
you
have
been
pleased
to
assume
but
till
then
i
must
beg
in
her
name
that
we
may
have
no
more
of
this
oh
rosalind
exclaimed
fanny
while
a
fresh
shower
of
tears
burst
from
her
eyes
how
can
you
speak
so
tell
me
my
dear
young
lady
said
cartwright
addressing
miss
torrington
in
a
voice
of
the
gentlest
kindness
did
good
mowbray
on
leaving
home
place
miss
fanny
under
your
care
no
sir
she
did
not
replied
rosalind
a
crimson
flush
of
anger
and
indignation
mounting
to
her
cheeks
but
being
considerably
older
than
fanny
i
deem
it
my
duty
to
prevent
her
if
possible
from
again
becoming
an
actor
in
such
a
scene
as
this
fanny
withdrew
her
arm
and
clasping
her
hands
together
again
exclaimed
oh
rosalind
do
not
agitate
yourself
my
good
child
said
the
vicar
i
shall
never
suspect
you
of
that
hardening
of
the
heart
which
would
lead
you
to
be
of
those
who
wish
to
banish
the
voice
of
prayer
from
the
roof
that
shelters
you
nor
shall
i
he
continued
meekly
but
firmly
nor
shall
i
consider
myself
justified
in
remitting
that
care
and
attention
which
i
promised
your
excellent
mother
to
bestow
on
you
because
this
unhappy
young
person
lifts
her
voice
against
the
holy
duties
of
my
calling
i
shall
return
to
you
in
the
evening
and
then
i
trust
we
shall
again
raise
our
voices
together
in
praise
and
prayer
so
saying
cartwright
took
his
hat
and
departed
the
three
young
ladies
were
left
standing
but
not
in
one
group
miss
cartwright
as
soon
as
released
from
her
kneeling
position
had
approached
a
window
and
was
assiduously
paring
her
nails
rosalind
fixed
her
eyes
upon
the
floor
and
seemed
to
be
revolving
some
question
that
puzzled
her
and
fanny
after
the
interval
of
a
moment
left
the
room
miss
torrington
approached
the
window
and
said
coldly
but
civilly
i
am
sorry
miss
cartwright
to
have
spoken
so
sternly
to
your
father
or
rather
for
the
cause
which
led
me
to
do
so
but
i
really
considered
it
as
my
duty
oh
pray
do
not
apologise
to
me
about
it
i
do
not
wish
to
offer
an
apology
for
doing
what
i
believe
to
be
right
but
only
to
express
my
sorrow
to
a
guest
in
the
house
that
is
my
home
for
having
been
obliged
to
say
any
thing
that
might
make
her
feel
uncomfortable
i
do
assure
you
miss
torrington
replied
the
vicar
daughter
that
my
feelings
are
very
particularly
independent
of
any
circumstance
accident
or
event
that
may
affect
cartwright
my
father
indeed
said
rosalind
fixing
on
her
a
glance
that
seemed
to
invite
her
confidence
indeed
repeated
henrietta
quietly
continuing
the
occupation
furnished
by
her
fingers
ends
but
without
showing
any
inclination
to
accept
the
invitation
rosalind
was
disconcerted
the
singularity
of
miss
cartwright
manner
piqued
her
curiosity
and
though
by
no
means
inclined
to
form
a
party
with
her
against
her
father
she
had
seen
enough
to
convince
her
that
they
were
far
from
being
on
very
affectionate
terms
together
a
feeling
of
pity
too
though
for
sorrows
and
sufferings
suggested
chiefly
by
her
own
imagination
gave
her
a
inclination
for
more
intimate
acquaintance
but
she
began
to
suspect
that
the
wish
for
this
was
wholly
on
her
side
and
not
shared
in
any
degree
by
her
companion
chilled
by
this
idea
and
out
of
spirits
from
the
prospect
of
being
daily
exposed
to
cartwright
visits
rosalind
prepared
to
leave
the
room
but
as
was
usual
with
her
prevailed
over
every
other
feeling
and
before
she
reached
the
door
she
turned
and
said
is
there
any
thing
miss
cartwright
that
i
can
offer
for
your
amusement
the
books
of
the
day
are
chiefly
in
our
i
believe
and
i
have
abundance
of
new
music
and
in
this
room
i
can
show
you
where
to
find
a
very
splendid
collection
of
engravings
i
wish
for
nothing
of
the
kind
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
shall
i
send
fanny
to
you
perhaps
notwithstanding
the
ocean
of
tears
you
have
seen
her
shed
she
would
prove
a
much
more
cheerful
companion
than
i
could
do
at
this
moment
i
do
not
wish
for
a
cheerful
companion
said
henrietta
is
there
any
thing
then
that
i
can
do
resumed
rosalind
half
smiling
that
may
assist
you
in
getting
rid
of
the
morning
you
may
sit
with
me
yourself
may
i
well
then
so
i
will
i
assure
you
that
i
only
thought
of
going
because
it
appeared
to
me
that
you
did
not
particularly
desire
my
company
to
say
the
truth
miss
torrington
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
thing
on
earth
particularly
worth
desiring
but
your
conversation
may
perhaps
be
amongst
the
most
endurable
besides
it
is
agreeable
to
look
at
you
you
are
very
civil
replied
rosalind
laughing
perhaps
you
would
like
me
to
hold
a
nosegay
in
my
hand
or
to
put
on
a
bonnet
and
feathers
that
i
might
be
still
better
worth
looking
at
if
i
had
a
bunch
of
flowers
before
my
eyes
i
should
not
want
you
no
woman
can
be
so
beautiful
as
a
collection
of
flowers
but
i
shall
do
very
well
i
dare
say
nothing
you
know
lasts
very
long
your
father
then
i
presume
has
taught
your
thoughts
miss
cartwright
to
fix
themselves
altogether
on
a
future
and
a
better
world
as
to
a
future
world
miss
torrington
i
must
have
better
authority
than
cartwright
before
i
pretend
to
know
any
thing
about
it
but
i
hope
your
distaste
for
that
which
we
enjoy
at
present
does
not
arise
from
its
having
been
unkind
to
you
when
i
was
a
child
answered
henrietta
i
had
a
kind
of
sickly
longing
for
kindness
but
now
that
i
am
older
and
wiser
i
can
not
say
that
i
think
kindness
or
unkindness
are
matters
of
much
consequence
that
indeed
is
a
feeling
that
must
put
one
speedily
either
above
or
below
sorrow
i
am
below
it
it
would
be
just
as
easy
to
say
above
miss
cartwright
and
if
you
really
have
reached
to
a
state
of
such
stoical
indifference
i
rather
wonder
you
should
not
feel
that
it
sets
you
above
all
the
poor
sensitive
souls
whom
you
must
see
longing
for
a
smile
and
trembling
at
a
frown
because
miss
torrington
i
have
constantly
felt
that
in
approaching
this
state
of
mind
i
have
been
gradually
sinking
lower
and
lower
in
my
own
estimation
i
am
become
so
hatefully
familiar
with
sin
and
wickedness
that
i
perfectly
loathe
myself
though
assuredly
it
has
ended
by
giving
me
a
very
degree
of
indifference
concerning
all
that
may
hereafter
happen
to
me
is
it
in
your
own
person
said
rosalind
jestingly
that
you
have
become
thus
familiar
with
sin
no
it
is
in
that
of
my
father
rosalind
started
you
talk
strangely
to
me
miss
cartwright
said
she
gravely
and
if
you
are
playing
upon
my
credulity
or
curiosity
i
must
submit
to
it
but
if
there
be
any
serious
meaning
in
what
you
say
it
would
be
more
generous
if
you
would
permit
me
to
understand
you
i
believe
you
are
aware
that
i
do
not
esteem
cartwright
an
avowal
which
delicacy
would
have
certainly
prevented
my
making
to
you
had
you
not
given
me
reason
to
suspect
that
i
do
not
very
greatly
esteem
him
either
said
henrietta
interrupting
her
exactly
so
and
as
i
am
deeply
interested
for
the
welfare
and
happiness
of
the
family
amongst
whom
he
seems
disposed
to
insinuate
himself
upon
terms
of
very
particular
intimacy
i
should
consider
it
as
a
great
kindness
if
you
would
tell
me
what
his
character
really
is
the
request
is
a
very
singular
one
considering
to
whom
it
is
addressed
said
miss
cartwright
and
besides
i
really
can
not
perceive
any
reason
in
the
world
why
i
should
be
guilty
of
an
indecorum
in
order
to
do
you
great
the
indecorum
miss
cartwright
has
been
already
committed
said
rosalind
you
have
already
spoken
of
your
father
as
you
should
not
have
spoken
unless
you
had
some
strong
and
virtuous
motive
for
it
how
exceedingly
refreshing
is
the
unwonted
voice
of
truth
exclaimed
henrietta
rosalind
torrington
you
are
an
honest
girl
and
will
not
betray
me
for
i
do
fear
him
coward
that
i
am
i
do
fear
his
cruelty
even
while
i
despise
his
power
i
think
but
lightly
she
continued
of
the
motes
that
people
this
paltry
world
of
ours
yet
there
are
gradations
amongst
us
from
the
kind
fool
who
like
you
rosalind
would
wish
to
spend
their
little
hour
of
life
in
doing
good
down
to
the
plotting
knave
who
like
my
father
miss
torrington
cares
not
what
mischief
he
may
do
so
that
his
own
unholy
interest
and
unholy
joys
may
be
increased
thereby
and
so
look
you
there
are
gradations
also
in
my
feelings
towards
them
from
very
light
and
easy
indifference
down
down
down
to
the
deepest
abyss
of
hatred
and
contempt
i
know
not
what
power
you
may
have
here
not
much
i
should
fear
for
though
you
are
rich
the
mowbrays
are
richer
yet
it
is
possible
i
think
that
if
the
energy
which
i
suspect
makes
part
of
your
character
be
roused
you
may
obtain
some
influence
if
you
do
use
it
to
keep
cartwright
as
far
distant
from
all
you
love
as
you
can
mistrust
him
yourself
and
teach
all
others
to
mistrust
and
now
never
attempt
to
renew
this
conversation
i
may
have
done
you
some
service
do
not
let
your
imprudence
make
me
repent
it
let
us
now
avoid
each
other
if
you
please
i
do
not
love
talking
and
would
not
willingly
be
led
into
it
again
miss
cartwright
left
the
room
as
soon
as
these
words
were
spoken
leaving
rosalind
in
a
state
of
mind
extremely
painful
through
all
the
strange
wildness
of
henrietta
manner
she
thought
that
she
could
trace
a
friendly
intention
to
put
her
on
her
guard
but
she
hardly
knew
what
the
mischief
was
which
she
feared
and
less
still
perhaps
what
she
could
do
to
guard
against
it
the
most
obvious
and
the
most
desirable
thing
if
she
could
achieve
it
was
the
preventing
cartwright
making
the
constant
morning
and
evening
visits
which
he
threatened
but
she
felt
that
her
power
was
indeed
small
and
such
as
it
was
she
knew
not
well
how
to
use
it
having
remained
for
above
an
hour
exactly
in
the
place
where
miss
cartwright
had
left
her
inventing
and
rejecting
a
variety
of
schemes
for
keeping
cartwright
from
the
house
during
the
absence
of
mowbray
she
at
length
determined
to
write
to
him
and
after
a
good
deal
of
meditation
produced
the
following
note
miss
torrington
presents
her
compliments
to
cartwright
and
begs
to
inform
him
that
having
been
very
strictly
brought
up
by
her
father
a
clergyman
of
the
established
church
she
can
not
consistently
with
her
ideas
of
what
is
right
continue
to
make
her
residence
in
a
house
where
irregular
and
extempore
are
held
she
therefore
takes
this
method
of
announcing
to
cartwright
that
if
he
perseveres
in
repeating
at
mowbray
park
the
scene
she
witnessed
this
morning
she
shall
be
obliged
to
leave
the
house
of
her
guardian
and
will
put
herself
under
the
protection
of
sir
gilbert
harrington
till
such
time
as
mowbray
shall
return
mowbray
park
july
this
note
she
immediately
despatched
to
the
vicarage
by
her
own
footman
who
was
ordered
to
wait
for
an
answer
and
in
the
course
of
an
hour
returned
with
the
following
short
epistle
cartwright
presents
his
compliments
to
miss
torrington
and
respectfully
requests
permission
to
wait
upon
her
for
a
few
minutes
morning
wrexhill
vicarage
july
nothing
could
be
less
like
the
answer
she
expected
than
this
note
and
she
might
possibly
have
been
doubtful
whether
to
grant
the
audience
requested
or
not
had
she
not
perceived
with
very
considerable
satisfaction
that
she
had
already
obtained
a
remission
of
the
evening
rhapsody
he
had
threatened
in
the
morning
which
inspired
her
with
reasonable
hope
that
her
remonstrance
would
not
prove
altogether
in
vain
she
determined
therefore
to
receive
cartwright
on
the
morrow
but
did
not
deem
it
necessary
to
send
another
express
to
say
so
feeling
pretty
certain
that
the
not
forbidding
his
approach
would
be
quite
sufficient
to
ensure
its
arrival
the
evening
passed
in
very
evident
and
very
fidgetty
expectation
on
the
part
of
fanny
who
more
than
once
strolled
out
upon
the
lawn
returning
with
an
air
of
restlessness
and
disappointment
but
rosalind
was
in
excellent
spirits
and
contrived
to
amuse
miss
cartwright
and
even
elicit
an
expression
of
pleasure
from
her
by
singing
some
of
her
sweetest
native
melodies
which
she
did
with
a
delicacy
and
perfection
of
taste
and
feeling
that
few
could
listen
to
without
delight
chapter
xiv
an
the
lime
rosalind
letter
to
mowbray
at
about
eleven
the
following
morning
miss
torrington
was
informed
that
cartwright
requested
to
speak
to
her
for
a
few
minutes
in
the
henrietta
was
with
her
when
the
message
was
delivered
and
seemed
to
await
her
reply
with
some
curiosity
i
will
wait
upon
him
immediately
was
the
civil
and
ready
answer
and
as
rosalind
gave
it
and
at
the
same
moment
rose
from
her
chair
to
obey
the
summons
she
looked
in
the
face
of
her
companion
to
see
if
there
were
any
wish
expressed
there
that
the
silence
so
strictly
enjoined
should
be
broken
but
miss
cartwright
was
occupied
by
a
volume
of
engravings
which
lay
before
her
and
rosalind
left
the
room
without
having
met
her
eye
it
is
impossible
to
imagine
a
demeanour
or
address
more
perfectly
gentlemanlike
and
respectful
than
those
of
cartwright
as
he
walked
across
the
room
to
receive
miss
torrington
strong
as
her
feelings
were
against
him
this
still
produced
some
effect
and
as
she
seated
herself
and
motioned
to
him
to
do
the
same
her
mental
soliloquy
amounted
to
this
at
any
rate
i
will
listen
patiently
to
what
he
has
to
say
i
have
taken
the
liberty
of
requesting
to
speak
to
you
miss
torrington
because
i
feel
persuaded
that
my
conduct
and
principles
have
from
some
accident
been
misunderstood
and
i
can
not
but
hope
that
it
may
be
in
my
power
to
explain
them
so
as
in
some
degree
to
remove
the
prejudice
which
i
fear
you
have
conceived
against
me
it
is
my
duty
sir
both
as
a
matter
of
courtesy
and
justice
to
hear
whatever
you
wish
to
say
in
justification
or
excuse
of
the
scene
i
witnessed
yesterday
morning
miss
fanny
mowbray
is
not
yet
recovered
from
the
effects
of
the
agitation
into
which
she
was
thrown
by
it
and
i
have
no
objection
cartwright
to
repeat
to
you
in
person
my
fixed
determination
not
to
continue
in
the
house
if
that
scene
be
repeated
it
is
impossible
replied
cartwright
to
find
a
lady
of
your
age
so
steadfast
in
adhering
to
what
she
believes
to
be
right
without
feeling
both
admiration
and
respect
for
her
and
i
should
think
forgive
me
if
i
wound
you
i
should
think
that
such
an
one
can
not
altogether
condemn
the
offering
of
prayer
and
thanksgiving
cartwright
replied
rosalind
her
colour
rising
and
her
voice
expressive
of
great
agitation
you
talk
of
having
been
misunderstood
but
it
is
i
sir
who
have
reason
to
make
this
complaint
from
which
of
my
words
either
written
or
spoken
do
you
presume
to
infer
that
i
contemn
the
offering
of
prayer
and
thanksgiving
i
beseech
you
to
bear
with
me
patiently
said
cartwright
with
a
look
and
tone
of
the
most
touching
mildness
and
be
assured
that
by
doing
so
we
shall
not
only
be
more
likely
to
make
ourselves
mutually
understood
but
finally
to
arrive
at
that
truth
which
i
am
willing
to
believe
is
equally
the
object
of
both
and
the
theme
my
dear
young
lady
on
which
we
speak
should
never
be
alluded
to
at
least
i
think
not
with
any
mixture
of
temper
poor
rosalind
honest
as
her
vehemence
was
she
felt
that
she
had
been
wrong
to
show
it
and
with
an
effort
that
did
her
honour
she
contrived
to
say
you
are
quite
right
sir
as
far
as
manner
is
concerned
you
have
greatly
the
advantage
of
me
by
your
and
calmness
herein
i
will
endeavour
to
imitate
you
and
assure
you
with
a
as
perfect
as
your
own
that
i
consider
the
offering
of
prayer
and
thanksgiving
as
the
first
duty
of
a
christian
it
is
in
consequence
of
the
reverence
in
which
i
hold
this
sacred
duty
that
i
shrink
from
seeing
it
performed
irreverently
i
have
been
taught
to
believe
sir
that
the
deepest
learning
the
most
deliberative
wisdom
and
the
most
grave
and
solemn
meditation
given
to
the
subject
by
the
fathers
and
founders
of
our
church
were
not
too
much
to
bestow
on
the
sublime
and
awful
attempt
to
address
ourselves
suitably
to
god
in
prayer
prayers
so
framed
and
fitted
for
every
exigency
that
human
nature
can
know
have
been
prepared
for
us
with
equal
piety
and
wisdom
and
while
such
exist
i
will
never
join
in
any
crude
unweighed
unauthorised
jargon
addressed
to
the
deity
however
vehement
the
assumption
of
piety
may
be
in
the
bold
man
who
uses
it
it
is
seldom
that
so
young
a
lady
replied
the
vicar
with
a
kind
and
gentle
smile
can
have
found
time
to
give
this
important
question
so
much
attention
as
you
appear
to
have
done
yet
perhaps
yet
perhaps
miss
torrington
when
a
few
years
more
of
deep
consideration
have
been
given
by
you
to
the
subject
you
may
be
led
to
think
that
fervour
of
feeling
may
more
than
atone
for
imperfection
in
expression
if
you
imagine
sir
replied
rosalind
in
a
voice
as
tranquil
and
deliberate
as
his
own
that
i
have
dared
to
regulate
my
conduct
and
opinions
on
such
a
point
as
this
by
any
wisdom
of
my
own
you
do
me
great
injustice
such
conduct
if
general
would
make
as
many
churches
upon
earth
as
there
are
audacious
spirits
who
reject
control
my
father
cartwright
was
one
whose
life
was
passed
in
the
situation
which
perhaps
beyond
all
others
in
the
world
taught
him
the
value
of
the
establishment
to
which
he
belonged
to
those
of
another
and
an
adverse
faith
he
was
a
kind
friend
and
generous
benefactor
but
he
could
not
be
insensible
nor
did
he
leave
me
so
of
the
superior
purity
and
moral
efficacy
of
his
own
and
i
hope
not
to
live
long
enough
to
forget
the
reverence
which
he
has
left
impressed
upon
my
mind
for
all
that
our
church
holds
sacred
not
for
worlds
my
excellent
young
lady
exclaimed
cartwright
with
warmth
would
i
attempt
to
shake
opinions
so
evidently
sustained
by
a
sense
of
duty
respect
for
such
will
assuredly
prevent
my
again
attempting
to
perform
the
office
which
offended
your
opinions
this
morning
as
long
as
you
continue
what
you
certainly
ought
to
be
at
this
time
the
mistress
of
this
family
i
will
only
ask
miss
torrington
in
return
for
the
sincere
veneration
i
feel
for
your
conscientious
scruples
that
you
will
judge
me
with
equal
candour
and
will
believe
that
however
we
may
differ
in
judgment
i
am
not
less
anxious
to
be
right
than
yourself
rosalind
answered
this
appeal
by
a
silent
bow
may
i
then
hope
that
we
are
friends
said
he
rising
and
presenting
his
hand
and
that
i
may
venture
to
call
as
i
promised
mowbray
i
would
do
on
yourself
miss
fanny
and
my
daughter
without
driving
you
from
the
house
certainly
sir
was
rosalind
cold
reply
the
request
appeared
as
reasonable
in
itself
as
it
was
politely
and
respectfully
made
and
to
refuse
it
would
have
been
equally
churlish
presumptuous
and
unjust
nevertheless
there
was
something
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
that
revolted
against
the
act
of
shaking
hands
with
him
and
feigning
to
be
occupied
by
arranging
some
flowers
on
the
table
she
suffered
the
offered
hand
to
remain
extended
till
at
length
its
patient
owner
withdrew
it
though
well
pleased
that
her
remonstrance
had
put
a
stop
to
the
extempore
prayings
at
the
house
rosalind
was
not
altogether
satisfied
by
the
result
of
the
interview
we
are
still
upon
infinitely
too
civil
terms
thought
she
but
i
see
that
just
at
present
it
would
be
an
herculean
labour
to
quarrel
with
him
if
i
smite
him
on
one
cheek
he
will
turn
himself
about
as
unresistingly
as
a
sucking
pig
upon
the
spit
and
submit
to
be
basted
all
round
without
uttering
a
single
squeak
but
when
mowbray
returns
i
suspect
that
it
will
be
my
turn
to
be
basted
i
am
sure
i
have
done
no
more
than
my
father
would
have
thought
right
with
this
consolation
she
returned
to
her
and
applied
herself
to
her
usual
occupations
henrietta
was
no
longer
there
but
as
the
fashion
of
the
house
was
for
every
one
to
find
employment
and
amusement
for
themselves
during
the
morning
she
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
pursue
her
in
order
to
prove
her
wish
to
be
agreeable
at
luncheon
the
three
young
ladies
met
as
usual
in
the
fanny
appeared
to
have
recovered
her
spirits
and
and
henrietta
seemed
to
wish
to
be
more
conversable
than
usual
they
then
strolled
into
the
gardens
visited
the
hothouses
and
finally
placed
themselves
in
a
shady
and
fragrant
bower
where
they
discoursed
of
poetry
and
music
for
an
hour
or
two
when
these
subjects
seemed
to
be
wellnigh
exhausted
miss
cartwright
rose
and
slowly
walked
towards
the
house
without
intimating
to
her
companions
what
it
was
her
purpose
to
do
next
rosalind
and
fanny
being
thus
left
the
former
said
what
do
you
think
of
our
new
acquaintance
fanny
how
do
you
like
miss
cartwright
i
do
not
think
she
seems
at
all
an
amiable
girl
replied
fanny
with
such
advantages
as
she
has
it
is
quite
astonishing
that
her
manners
are
so
little
agreeable
she
is
not
remarkably
conversable
certainly
said
rosalind
but
i
suspect
that
she
has
very
bad
health
how
dreadfully
sallow
she
is
i
suspect
that
she
has
a
worse
infirmity
than
bad
health
answered
fanny
she
has
i
fear
an
extremely
bad
temper
she
has
not
a
violent
temper
at
any
rate
observed
rosalind
for
i
never
remember
to
have
seen
any
one
who
gave
me
a
greater
idea
of
being
subdued
and
that
is
not
at
all
the
impression
she
makes
upon
me
said
fanny
i
should
call
her
rather
sullen
than
gentle
and
obstinate
instead
of
subdued
but
this
gossiping
is
sad
idle
work
rosalind
as
miss
henrietta
has
fortunately
taken
herself
off
i
may
go
on
with
what
i
was
doing
before
luncheon
late
in
the
evening
cartwright
and
his
son
jacob
paid
the
young
ladies
a
visit
the
vicar
conversation
was
chiefly
addressed
to
miss
torrington
and
if
she
had
never
seen
him
before
she
must
have
agreed
with
fanny
in
thinking
him
one
of
the
most
agreeable
persons
in
the
world
for
he
spoke
fluently
and
well
upon
every
subject
and
with
a
person
and
voice
calculated
to
please
every
eye
and
every
ear
there
were
probably
indeed
but
few
who
could
retain
as
steady
a
dislike
to
him
as
our
rosalind
did
the
young
man
got
hold
of
a
purse
that
fanny
was
netting
and
did
his
best
to
entangle
her
silks
but
his
chief
amusement
was
derived
from
attempts
to
quiz
and
plague
his
sister
who
treated
him
much
as
a
large
and
powerful
dog
does
a
little
one
enduring
his
gambols
and
annoying
tricks
with
imperturbable
patience
for
a
while
and
then
suddenly
putting
forth
a
heavy
paw
and
driving
him
off
in
an
instant
the
following
day
passed
very
nearly
in
the
same
manner
excepting
that
the
three
girls
separated
immediately
after
breakfast
and
did
not
meet
again
till
on
the
third
fanny
was
the
first
to
leave
the
and
miss
cartwright
and
rosalind
being
left
together
the
former
said
i
suppose
we
owe
our
repose
from
morning
and
evening
ranting
to
you
miss
torrington
i
certainly
did
not
approve
it
miss
cartwright
and
i
took
the
liberty
of
telling
your
father
so
you
were
undoubtedly
very
right
and
very
wise
and
i
dare
say
you
feel
some
inward
satisfaction
at
your
success
cartwright
has
really
shown
great
deference
to
your
opinion
by
so
immediately
abandoning
at
your
request
so
very
favourite
an
occupation
rosalind
was
about
to
reply
when
miss
cartwright
changed
the
conversation
by
abruptly
saying
will
you
take
a
stroll
with
me
this
morning
miss
torrington
yes
certainly
if
you
wish
it
but
i
think
we
shall
find
it
very
warm
oh
no
i
will
lead
you
a
very
nice
shady
walk
to
the
prettiest
and
most
sheltered
little
thicket
in
the
world
let
us
put
on
our
bonnets
directly
shall
we
i
will
not
delay
you
a
moment
said
rosalind
shall
i
ask
fanny
to
go
with
us
why
no
replied
miss
cartwright
i
think
you
had
better
not
the
chances
are
ten
to
one
against
her
finding
it
convenient
you
know
she
is
so
fond
of
solitary
study
i
believe
you
are
right
said
rosalind
and
the
young
ladies
parted
to
meet
again
a
few
minutes
after
with
bonnets
and
parasols
at
the
and
which
way
are
we
to
go
to
find
this
welcome
shade
said
rosalind
holding
her
parasol
low
down
to
shelter
her
pretty
face
the
sun
is
almost
intolerable
this
way
said
henrietta
turning
aside
from
the
drive
in
a
direction
which
soon
brought
them
to
a
ride
that
surrounded
the
park
we
shall
find
it
delightful
here
it
was
an
hour
which
in
the
month
of
july
few
ladies
would
choose
for
walking
but
miss
torrington
politely
exerted
herself
to
converse
though
she
secretly
longed
to
be
lying
silent
and
alone
on
the
sofa
in
her
own
with
no
greater
exertion
than
was
necessary
for
the
perusal
of
the
dear
pages
of
some
new
romance
henrietta
however
only
answered
her
dryly
and
shortly
and
presently
said
i
should
be
really
very
much
obliged
to
you
miss
torrington
if
you
would
not
speak
to
me
any
more
just
listen
to
the
blackbirds
will
you
depend
upon
it
we
can
neither
of
us
express
ourselves
one
half
so
well
as
they
do
rosalind
willingly
submitted
to
this
request
and
the
young
ladies
walked
onward
producing
no
other
sound
than
the
occasional
brushing
of
their
dresses
against
the
underwood
which
at
every
step
became
thicker
rendering
the
path
almost
too
narrow
for
two
to
walk
abreast
now
let
us
just
turn
down
through
this
little
opening
said
henrietta
in
a
whisper
and
pray
do
not
speak
to
me
rosalind
who
began
to
believe
that
she
must
have
some
meaning
for
her
strange
manner
of
proceeding
followed
her
in
perfect
silence
and
they
had
not
gone
far
into
the
intricacies
of
the
tangled
copse
before
she
heard
the
sound
of
a
human
voice
at
no
great
distance
from
her
henrietta
who
was
in
advance
turned
round
and
laid
her
finger
on
her
lips
the
caution
was
not
needed
rosalind
had
already
recognised
the
tones
of
cartwright
and
a
few
more
silent
steps
brought
them
to
a
spot
thickly
surrounded
on
all
sides
but
from
whence
they
could
look
out
upon
a
small
and
beautiful
opening
in
the
centre
of
which
a
majestic
stretched
its
arms
in
all
directions
over
the
soft
green
turf
rosalind
instantly
recognised
the
spot
as
one
frequently
resorted
to
in
their
evening
rambles
for
the
sake
of
its
cool
and
secluded
beauty
and
also
because
a
bench
divided
into
commodious
stalls
surrounded
the
capacious
tree
from
whence
opened
a
vista
commanding
a
charming
view
across
the
park
on
the
turf
before
this
bench
and
with
their
backs
turned
towards
the
spot
where
rosalind
and
henrietta
stood
knelt
cartwright
and
fanny
his
eyes
were
fixed
upon
her
with
passionate
admiration
and
the
first
words
they
distinctly
heard
were
these
spoken
with
great
vehemence
by
the
vicar
persecuted
trampled
on
turned
forth
from
every
other
roof
let
thy
blue
vault
spread
over
us
and
while
i
struggle
to
snatch
this
precious
brand
from
the
eternal
fire
of
thy
wrath
pour
upon
our
heads
the
dew
of
thy
love
grant
me
power
to
save
this
one
dear
soul
alive
though
it
should
seem
good
in
thy
sight
that
millions
should
perish
around
her
save
her
from
the
eternal
flame
that
even
now
rises
to
lick
her
feet
and
if
not
stayed
by
prayer
the
prayer
of
thy
saints
will
speedily
envelope
and
consume
her
rosalind
remained
to
hear
no
more
heartsick
indignant
disgusted
and
almost
terrified
by
what
she
saw
and
heard
she
retreated
hastily
and
followed
by
henrietta
rapidly
pursued
her
way
to
the
house
her
companion
made
an
effort
to
overtake
her
and
almost
out
of
breath
by
an
exertion
to
which
she
was
hardly
equal
she
said
i
have
shown
you
this
miss
torrington
for
the
sake
of
giving
you
a
useful
lesson
if
you
are
wise
you
will
profit
by
it
and
learn
to
know
that
it
is
not
always
safe
to
suppose
you
have
produced
an
effect
merely
because
it
may
be
worth
some
one
while
to
persuade
you
into
believing
it
having
said
thus
much
to
point
the
moral
of
our
walk
in
the
sun
you
may
go
your
way
and
i
will
go
mine
i
shall
not
enter
upon
any
more
elaborate
exposition
of
cartwright
character
so
saying
she
fell
back
among
the
bushes
and
rosalind
reached
the
house
alone
on
entering
her
miss
torrington
sat
herself
down
with
her
eau
de
cologne
bottle
in
one
hand
and
a
large
feather
fan
in
the
other
to
meditate
coolly
if
she
could
but
at
any
rate
to
meditate
upon
what
she
ought
to
do
in
order
immediately
to
put
a
stop
to
the
very
objectionable
influence
which
cartwright
appeared
to
exercise
over
the
mind
of
fanny
had
she
been
aware
of
sir
gilbert
harrington
having
written
to
recall
his
refusal
of
the
executorship
she
would
immediately
have
had
recourse
to
him
but
this
fact
had
never
transpired
beyond
mowbray
and
the
vicar
and
the
idea
that
he
had
resisted
the
representation
which
she
felt
sure
his
son
had
made
to
him
after
the
conversation
helen
and
herself
had
held
with
him
not
only
made
her
too
angry
to
attempt
any
farther
to
soften
him
but
naturally
impressed
her
with
the
belief
that
do
or
say
what
she
would
on
the
subject
it
must
be
in
vain
at
length
it
struck
her
that
charles
mowbray
was
the
most
proper
person
to
whom
she
could
address
herself
yet
the
writing
such
a
letter
as
might
immediately
bring
him
home
was
a
measure
which
under
all
existing
circumstances
she
felt
to
be
awkward
and
disagreeable
but
the
more
she
meditated
the
more
she
felt
convinced
that
notwithstanding
the
obvious
objections
to
it
this
was
the
safest
course
she
could
pursue
so
having
once
made
up
her
mind
upon
the
subject
she
set
about
it
without
farther
delay
and
with
the
straightforward
frankness
and
sincerity
of
her
character
produced
the
following
epistle
dear
mowbray
your
last
letter
to
helen
giving
so
very
agreeable
an
account
of
the
style
and
manner
of
your
makes
it
an
ungracious
task
to
interrupt
your
studies
and
yet
that
is
what
i
am
bent
upon
doing
you
will
be
rather
puzzled
i
suspect
at
finding
me
assuming
the
rights
and
privileges
of
a
correspondent
and
moreover
of
an
adviser
or
rather
a
dictator
but
so
it
is
and
you
must
not
blame
me
till
you
are
quite
sure
you
know
all
my
reasons
for
it
mowbray
is
gone
to
london
accompanied
by
helen
for
the
purpose
of
proving
i
think
it
is
called
your
father
will
a
business
in
which
sir
gilbert
harrington
has
most
unkindly
for
all
of
you
refused
to
join
her
this
journey
was
so
suddenly
decided
upon
that
dear
helen
had
no
time
to
write
to
you
about
it
she
knew
not
she
was
to
go
till
about
nine
the
evening
preceding
the
vicar
of
wrexhill
was
probably
acquainted
with
the
intended
movement
earlier
for
no
day
passes
or
has
passed
for
some
weeks
without
his
holding
a
private
consultation
with
your
mother
oh
that
vicar
charles
i
think
i
told
you
that
i
hated
him
and
you
seemed
to
smile
at
my
hatred
as
a
sort
of
missish
impertinence
and
caprice
but
what
was
instinct
then
has
become
reason
now
and
i
am
strangely
mistaken
if
your
hatred
would
not
fully
keep
pace
with
mine
had
you
seen
and
heard
what
i
have
done
when
i
decided
upon
writing
to
you
i
intended
i
believe
to
enter
into
all
particulars
but
i
can
not
do
this
you
must
see
for
yourself
and
draw
your
own
inferences
my
dislike
for
this
man
may
carry
me
too
far
and
you
must
be
much
more
capable
of
forming
a
judgment
respecting
his
motives
than
i
can
be
of
this
however
i
am
quite
sure
fanny
ought
at
this
time
to
have
some
one
near
her
more
capable
of
protecting
her
from
the
mischievous
influence
of
this
hateful
man
than
i
am
i
know
charles
that
you
have
no
very
exalted
idea
of
my
wisdom
and
i
am
not
without
some
fear
that
instead
of
coming
home
immediately
as
i
think
you
ought
to
do
you
may
write
me
a
very
witty
clever
answer
with
reasons
as
plenty
as
blackberries
to
prove
that
i
am
a
goose
not
do
this
i
do
not
think
that
you
know
me
very
well
but
in
common
courtesy
you
ought
not
to
believe
that
any
young
lady
would
write
you
such
a
summons
as
this
without
having
very
serious
reasons
for
it
as
one
proof
of
the
intimacy
between
the
family
of
the
vicar
and
your
own
you
will
on
your
arrival
find
the
daughter
miss
cartwright
established
here
to
console
us
for
your
mother
and
helen
absence
she
is
a
very
singular
personage
but
on
her
i
pass
no
judgment
sincerely
feeling
that
i
am
not
competent
to
it
if
my
opinion
be
of
sufficient
weight
to
induce
you
to
come
mowbray
i
must
beg
you
to
let
your
arrival
appear
the
result
of
accident
and
not
to
let
any
one
but
helen
know
of
this
letter
believe
me
very
sincerely
your
friend
rosalind
torrington
chapter
xv
rosalind
conversation
with
miss
mrs
simpson
and
miss
richards
meet
the
vicar
at
the
the
the
walk
home
in
the
course
of
the
morning
after
this
letter
was
despatched
miss
cartwright
and
rosalind
again
found
themselves
the
nature
of
rosalind
torrington
was
so
very
completely
the
reverse
of
mysterious
or
intriguing
that
far
from
wishing
to
lead
henrietta
to
talk
of
her
father
in
that
style
of
hints
and
innuendos
to
which
the
young
lady
seemed
addicted
she
determined
in
future
carefully
to
avoid
the
subject
although
it
was
very
evident
from
the
preconcerted
walk
to
the
that
notwithstanding
her
declaration
to
the
contrary
miss
cartwright
was
desirous
to
make
her
acquainted
with
the
character
and
conduct
of
her
father
whether
it
were
that
spirit
of
contradiction
which
is
said
to
possess
the
breast
of
woman
or
any
other
more
respectable
feeling
it
may
be
difficult
to
decide
but
it
is
certain
that
the
less
rosalind
appeared
disposed
to
speak
of
the
adventure
of
yesterday
the
more
desirous
did
henrietta
feel
to
lead
her
to
it
you
were
somewhat
disappointed
i
fancy
miss
torrington
said
she
to
discover
that
though
you
had
contrived
to
banish
the
conventicle
from
the
house
it
had
raised
its
voice
in
the
grounds
indeed
i
was
replied
rosalind
i
rather
think
that
you
are
addicted
to
speaking
truth
and
perhaps
you
pique
yourself
upon
it
resumed
miss
cartwright
will
you
venture
to
tell
me
what
you
think
of
the
scene
you
witnessed
you
are
not
the
person
i
should
most
naturally
have
selected
as
the
confidant
of
my
opinions
respecting
cartwright
said
rosalind
but
since
you
put
the
question
plainly
i
will
answer
it
plainly
and
confess
that
i
suspect
him
not
only
of
wishing
to
inculcate
his
own
calvinistic
doctrines
on
the
mind
of
fanny
mowbray
but
moreover
notwithstanding
his
disproportionate
age
of
gaining
her
affections
her
affections
repeated
henrietta
and
with
what
view
do
you
imagine
he
is
endeavouring
to
gain
her
affections
doubtless
with
a
view
to
making
her
his
wife
though
to
be
sure
the
idea
is
preposterous
sufficiently
pray
miss
torrington
has
miss
fanny
mowbray
an
independent
fortune
none
whatever
like
the
rest
of
the
family
she
is
become
by
the
death
of
her
father
entirely
dependent
upon
mrs
mowbray
your
fortune
is
entirely
at
your
own
disposal
i
believe
rosalind
looked
provoked
at
the
idle
turn
miss
cartwright
was
giving
to
a
conversation
which
though
she
had
not
led
to
it
interested
her
deeply
do
not
suspect
me
of
impertinence
said
henrietta
in
a
tone
more
gentle
than
ordinary
but
such
is
the
case
is
it
not
yes
miss
cartwright
was
rosalind
grave
reply
then
do
you
know
that
i
think
it
infinitely
more
probable
cartwright
may
have
it
in
contemplation
to
make
you
his
wife
i
beg
your
pardon
miss
cartwright
said
rosalind
but
i
really
thought
that
you
were
speaking
of
your
father
seriously
and
it
seems
you
are
disposed
to
punish
me
for
imagining
you
would
do
so
to
one
so
nearly
a
stranger
i
never
jest
on
any
subject
replied
the
girl
knitting
her
dark
brows
into
a
frown
of
such
austerity
as
almost
made
rosalind
tremble
a
reasoning
being
who
has
nothing
to
hope
among
the
realities
on
this
side
the
grave
and
hopes
nothing
on
the
other
is
not
very
likely
to
be
jocose
good
heavens
miss
cartwright
exclaimed
rosalind
what
dreadful
language
is
this
are
you
determined
to
prove
to
me
that
there
may
be
opinions
and
doctrines
more
terrible
still
than
those
of
your
father
i
had
no
meaning
of
the
kind
i
assure
you
replied
henrietta
in
her
usual
quiet
manner
which
always
seemed
to
hover
between
the
bitterness
of
a
sneer
and
the
quietude
or
indifference
of
philosophy
pray
do
not
trouble
yourself
for
a
moment
to
think
about
me
or
my
opinions
you
might
perhaps
as
you
are
a
girl
do
some
good
if
you
fully
comprehended
all
that
was
going
on
around
you
though
it
is
very
doubtful
for
it
is
impossible
to
say
to
what
extent
the
besotted
folly
of
people
may
go
but
do
you
think
it
might
on
the
whole
be
quite
as
probable
that
cartwright
may
wish
to
marry
the
mother
as
the
daughter
mrs
mowbray
good
gracious
no
then
we
differ
but
may
i
ask
you
why
you
think
otherwise
one
reason
is
that
mowbray
recent
widowhood
seems
to
put
such
an
idea
entirely
out
of
the
question
and
another
that
he
appears
to
be
positively
making
love
to
fanny
oh
is
that
all
i
do
assure
you
there
is
nothing
at
all
particular
in
that
he
would
tell
you
himself
i
am
sure
if
you
were
to
enter
upon
the
subject
with
him
that
it
is
his
duty
to
influence
and
lead
the
hearts
of
his
flock
into
the
way
he
would
have
them
go
by
means
in
his
power
then
you
really
do
not
think
he
has
been
making
love
to
fanny
i
am
sure
miss
torrington
replied
henrietta
very
gravely
i
did
not
mean
to
say
so
indeed
indeed
miss
cartwright
said
rosalind
with
evident
symptoms
of
impatience
these
riddles
vex
me
cruelly
if
your
father
make
love
to
this
dear
fanciful
child
he
must
i
suppose
have
some
hope
that
she
will
marry
him
how
can
i
answer
you
exclaimed
henrietta
with
real
feeling
you
can
not
be
above
two
or
three
years
younger
than
i
am
yet
your
purity
and
innocence
make
me
feel
myself
a
monster
for
heaven
sake
do
not
trifle
with
me
cried
rosalind
her
face
and
neck
dyed
with
indignant
blood
you
surely
do
not
mean
that
your
father
is
seeking
to
seduce
this
unhappy
child
watch
cartwright
a
little
while
rosalind
torrington
as
i
have
done
for
the
six
last
terrible
years
of
my
hateful
life
and
you
may
obtain
perhaps
some
faint
idea
of
the
crooked
complex
machinery
the
movements
and
the
shiftings
and
the
balancings
by
which
his
course
is
regulated
human
passions
are
in
him
for
ever
struggling
with
and
combating
what
may
be
called
in
their
strength
avarice
and
ambition
to
touch
to
influence
to
lead
to
rule
to
tyrannise
over
the
hearts
and
souls
of
all
he
approaches
is
the
great
object
of
his
life
he
would
willingly
do
this
in
the
hearts
of
men
but
for
the
most
part
he
has
found
them
tough
and
he
now
i
think
seems
to
rest
all
his
hopes
of
fame
wealth
and
station
on
the
power
he
can
obtain
over
i
say
not
she
added
after
a
pause
while
a
slight
blush
passed
over
her
pallid
cheek
that
i
believe
his
senses
uninfluenced
by
beauty
this
is
far
hatefully
far
from
being
the
case
with
cartwright
but
he
is
careful
most
cunningly
careful
whatever
victims
he
makes
never
to
become
one
in
his
own
person
you
would
find
were
you
to
watch
him
that
his
system
both
for
pleasure
and
profit
consists
of
a
certain
graduated
to
every
woman
within
his
reach
not
too
poor
too
old
or
too
ugly
but
if
any
among
them
fancy
that
he
would
sacrifice
the
thousandth
part
of
a
hair
breadth
of
his
worldly
hopes
for
all
they
could
give
him
in
return
they
are
mistaken
the
character
you
paint
said
rosalind
who
grew
pale
as
she
listened
is
too
terrible
for
me
fully
to
understand
and
i
would
turn
my
eyes
from
the
portrait
and
endeavour
to
forget
that
i
had
ever
heard
of
it
were
not
those
i
love
endangered
by
it
hateful
as
all
this
new
knowledge
is
to
me
i
must
still
question
you
further
miss
cartwright
what
do
you
suppose
to
be
his
object
in
thus
working
upon
the
mind
of
fanny
mowbray
his
motives
depend
upon
it
are
manifold
religion
and
love
the
new
birth
and
intellectual
attachment
mystical
sympathy
of
hearts
and
the
certainty
of
eternal
perdition
to
all
that
he
does
not
take
under
the
shadow
of
his
wing
these
are
the
tools
with
which
he
works
he
has
got
his
foot
perhaps
you
may
think
it
a
cloven
one
but
such
as
it
is
he
seems
to
have
got
it
pretty
firmly
planted
within
the
paling
of
mowbray
park
he
made
me
follow
him
hither
as
a
volunteer
visiter
very
much
against
my
inclination
but
if
by
what
i
have
said
you
may
be
enabled
to
defeat
any
of
his
various
projects
among
ye
for
he
never
plots
i
shall
cease
to
regret
that
i
came
my
power
of
doing
any
good
replied
rosalind
must
i
fear
be
altogether
destroyed
by
my
ignorance
of
what
cartwright
intentions
and
expectations
are
you
have
hinted
various
things
but
all
so
vaguely
that
i
own
i
do
not
feel
more
capable
of
keeping
my
friends
from
any
danger
which
may
threaten
them
than
before
this
conversation
took
place
i
am
sorry
for
it
said
henrietta
coldly
but
i
have
really
no
information
more
accurate
to
give
i
truly
believe
that
you
have
meant
very
kindly
said
rosalind
looking
seriously
distressed
will
you
go
one
step
farther
and
say
what
you
would
advise
me
to
do
miss
cartwright
no
certainly
miss
torrington
i
will
not
but
i
will
give
you
a
hint
or
two
what
not
to
do
do
not
appear
at
all
better
acquainted
with
me
than
i
show
myself
disposed
to
be
with
you
do
not
make
the
slightest
alteration
in
your
manner
of
receiving
cartwright
and
do
not
from
any
motive
whatever
repeat
one
syllable
of
this
conversation
to
fanny
mowbray
should
you
disobey
this
last
injunction
you
will
be
guilty
of
very
cruel
and
ungrateful
treachery
towards
me
having
said
this
with
the
appearance
of
more
emotion
than
she
had
hitherto
manifested
henrietta
rose
and
left
the
room
at
length
thought
rosalind
she
has
spoken
out
yet
what
are
we
likely
to
be
the
better
for
it
it
seems
that
there
is
a
great
net
thrown
over
us
of
which
we
shall
feel
and
see
the
meshes
when
he
who
has
made
prey
of
us
begins
to
pull
the
draught
to
shore
but
how
to
escape
from
it
the
oracle
sayeth
not
on
the
evening
of
that
day
simpson
and
the
eldest
miss
richards
walked
over
from
wrexhill
to
pay
a
visit
at
the
park
they
were
not
aware
of
the
absence
of
mowbray
and
seemed
disposed
to
shorten
their
visit
on
finding
she
was
not
at
home
but
rosalind
who
for
the
last
hour
had
been
sitting
on
thorns
expecting
cartwright
to
make
his
evening
call
most
cordially
and
earnestly
invited
them
to
stay
till
after
tea
feeling
that
their
presence
would
greatly
relieve
the
embarrassment
which
she
feared
she
might
betray
on
again
seeing
the
vicar
but
it
will
be
so
late
said
miss
richards
how
are
we
to
get
home
after
it
is
dark
remember
simpson
there
is
no
moon
it
is
very
true
said
simpson
i
am
afraid
my
dear
miss
torrington
that
we
must
deny
ourselves
the
pleasure
you
offer
but
i
am
such
a
nervous
creature
it
is
very
seldom
that
i
stir
out
without
ordering
a
to
follow
me
and
i
regret
excessively
that
i
omitted
to
do
so
this
evening
i
think
said
rosalind
colouring
at
her
own
eagerness
which
she
was
conscious
must
appear
rather
new
and
rather
strange
to
simpson
with
whom
she
had
hardly
ever
exchanged
a
dozen
words
before
i
think
cartwright
will
very
likely
be
here
this
evening
and
perhaps
he
might
attend
you
home
do
you
not
think
miss
cartwright
she
added
turning
to
henrietta
that
it
is
very
likely
your
father
will
call
this
evening
good
gracious
miss
cartwright
i
beg
your
pardon
i
did
not
know
you
i
hope
you
heard
that
i
called
so
very
happy
to
cultivate
your
acquaintance
oh
dear
i
would
not
miss
seeing
cartwright
for
the
world
thank
you
my
dear
miss
torrington
thank
you
miss
fanny
i
will
just
set
my
hair
to
rights
a
little
if
you
will
give
me
leave
perhaps
miss
fanny
you
will
permit
me
to
go
into
your
such
was
the
effect
produced
by
the
vicar
name
upon
the
handsome
widow
miss
richards
coloured
smiled
spoke
to
henrietta
with
very
respectful
politeness
and
finally
followed
her
friend
simpson
out
of
the
room
accompanied
by
fanny
who
willingly
undertook
to
be
their
gentlewoman
usher
cartwright
has
already
made
some
impression
on
these
fair
ladies
or
i
am
greatly
mistaken
said
henrietta
did
you
remark
miss
torrington
the
effect
produced
by
his
name
i
did
replied
rosalind
and
my
reasonings
upon
it
are
very
consolatory
for
if
he
has
already
found
time
and
inclination
to
produce
so
great
effect
there
why
should
we
fear
that
his
labours
of
love
here
should
prove
more
dangerous
in
their
tendency
very
true
nor
do
i
see
any
reason
in
the
world
why
the
mowbray
is
in
greater
peril
than
the
simpson
or
the
fanny
than
the
louisa
excepting
that
one
widow
is
about
twenty
times
richer
than
the
other
and
the
little
young
lady
about
five
hundred
times
handsomer
than
the
great
one
at
this
moment
the
cartwrights
father
and
son
were
seen
turning
off
from
the
regular
approach
to
the
house
towards
the
little
gate
that
opened
from
the
lawn
a
friendly
and
familiar
mode
of
entrance
which
seemed
to
have
become
quite
habitual
to
them
rosalind
who
was
the
first
to
perceive
them
flew
towards
the
door
saying
you
must
excuse
me
for
running
away
miss
cartwright
i
invited
that
furbelow
widow
to
stay
on
purpose
to
spare
me
this
almost
meeting
i
will
seek
the
ladies
and
return
with
them
then
so
will
i
too
said
henrietta
hastily
following
her
i
am
by
no
means
disposed
to
stand
the
which
i
know
will
ensue
if
i
remain
here
alone
the
consequence
of
this
movement
was
that
the
vicar
and
his
son
prepared
their
smiles
in
vain
for
on
entering
the
sofas
and
ottomans
footstools
tables
and
chairs
alone
greeted
them
young
cartwright
immediately
began
peeping
into
the
and
portfolios
which
lay
on
the
tables
look
here
sir
said
he
holding
up
a
caricature
of
lord
b
is
not
this
sinful
do
be
quiet
jacob
we
shall
have
them
here
in
a
moment
i
really
wish
i
could
teach
you
when
your
interest
is
at
stake
to
make
the
best
of
yourself
you
know
that
i
should
be
particularly
pleased
by
your
marrying
miss
torrington
and
i
do
beg
my
dear
boy
that
you
will
not
suffer
your
childish
spirits
to
put
any
difficulties
in
my
way
i
will
become
an
example
unto
all
men
replied
jacob
shutting
up
his
eyes
and
mouth
demurely
and
placing
himself
bolt
upright
upon
the
if
you
and
your
sister
could
but
mingle
natures
a
little
said
cartwright
you
would
both
be
wonderfully
improved
nothing
with
which
i
am
acquainted
however
joyous
can
ever
induce
henrietta
to
smile
and
nothing
however
sad
can
prevent
your
being
on
the
broad
grin
from
morning
to
night
however
of
the
two
i
confess
i
think
you
are
the
most
endurable
a
whip
for
the
horse
a
bridle
for
the
ass
and
a
rod
for
the
back
said
jacob
in
a
sanctified
tone
upon
my
honour
jacob
i
shall
be
very
angry
with
you
if
you
do
not
set
about
this
as
i
would
have
you
do
make
ducks
and
drakes
of
eighty
thousand
pounds
at
least
not
till
you
have
got
them
answer
not
a
fool
according
to
his
folly
least
he
be
wise
in
his
own
conceit
said
jacob
cartwright
smiled
as
it
seemed
against
his
will
but
shook
his
head
very
solemnly
i
tell
you
what
jacob
said
he
if
i
see
you
set
about
this
in
a
way
to
please
me
i
give
you
five
shillings
morning
wherefore
is
there
a
price
in
the
hand
of
a
fool
to
get
wisdom
seeing
he
hath
no
heart
to
it
replied
jacob
nevertheless
father
i
will
look
lovingly
upon
the
maiden
and
receive
thy
promised
gift
even
as
thou
sayest
upon
my
word
jacob
you
try
my
patience
too
severely
said
the
vicar
yet
there
was
certainly
but
little
wrath
in
his
eye
as
he
said
so
and
his
chartered
libertine
of
a
son
was
preparing
again
to
answer
him
in
the
words
of
solomon
but
in
a
spirit
of
very
indecent
buffoonery
when
the
door
opened
and
simpson
miss
richards
and
fanny
mowbray
entered
it
appeared
that
rosalind
and
miss
cartwright
on
escaping
from
the
had
not
sought
the
other
ladies
but
taken
refuge
in
the
from
whence
they
issued
immediately
after
the
others
had
passed
the
door
and
entering
the
with
them
enjoyed
the
gratification
of
witnessing
the
meeting
of
the
vicar
and
his
fair
parishioners
to
the
surprise
of
rosalind
and
the
great
though
silent
amusement
of
her
companion
they
perceived
that
both
the
stranger
ladies
had
contrived
to
make
a
very
edifying
and
remarkable
alteration
in
the
general
appearance
of
their
dress
miss
richards
had
combed
her
abounding
black
curls
as
nearly
straight
as
their
nature
would
allow
and
finally
brought
them
into
very
reverential
order
by
the
aid
of
her
ears
and
sundry
black
pins
to
boot
an
arrangement
by
no
means
unfavourable
to
the
display
of
her
dark
eyes
and
eyebrows
but
the
change
produced
by
the
toilet
of
the
widow
was
considerably
more
important
a
transparent
blond
rather
calculated
to
adorn
than
conceal
that
part
of
the
person
to
which
it
belonged
was
now
completely
hidden
by
a
silk
handkerchief
tightly
smoothly
and
with
careful
security
pinned
behind
and
before
and
above
and
below
upon
her
full
but
graceful
bust
rosalind
had
more
than
once
of
late
amused
herself
by
looking
over
the
pages
of
molière
tartuffe
and
a
passage
now
occurred
to
her
that
she
could
not
resist
muttering
in
the
ear
of
henrietta
ah
mon
dieu
je
vous
prie
avant
que
de
parler
ce
mouchoir
the
comer
of
miss
cartwright
mouth
expressed
her
appreciation
of
the
quotation
but
by
a
movement
so
slight
that
none
but
rosalind
could
perceive
it
meanwhile
the
vicar
approached
simpson
with
a
look
that
was
full
of
meaning
and
intended
to
express
admiration
both
of
her
mental
and
personal
endowments
she
too
had
banished
the
drooping
ringlets
from
her
cheeks
and
appeared
before
him
with
all
the
pretty
severity
of
a
madonna
band
across
her
forehead
was
it
in
the
nature
of
man
to
witness
such
touching
proofs
of
his
influence
without
being
affected
thereby
at
any
rate
such
indifference
made
no
part
of
the
character
of
the
vicar
of
wrexhill
and
the
murmured
bless
you
my
dear
lady
which
accompanied
his
neighbourly
pressure
of
the
widow
simpson
hand
gave
her
to
understand
how
much
his
grateful
and
affectionate
feelings
were
gratified
by
her
attention
to
the
hints
he
had
found
an
opportunity
to
give
her
during
a
conversation
at
her
own
house
a
few
days
before
nor
was
the
delicate
attention
of
miss
richards
overlooked
she
too
felt
at
her
fingers
ends
how
greatly
the
sacrifice
of
her
curls
was
approved
by
the
graceful
vicar
who
now
sat
down
surrounded
by
this
fair
bevy
of
ladies
smiling
with
bland
and
gentle
sweetness
on
them
all
jacob
thought
of
the
promised
five
shillings
and
displaying
his
fine
teeth
from
ear
to
ear
presented
a
chair
to
miss
torrington
i
wish
you
would
let
us
have
a
song
miss
rosalind
torrington
said
he
stationing
himself
at
the
back
of
her
chair
and
leaning
over
her
shoulder
i
am
told
that
your
voice
beats
every
thing
on
earth
hollow
his
eye
caught
an
approving
glance
from
his
father
as
he
took
this
station
and
he
wisely
trusted
to
his
attitude
for
obtaining
his
reward
for
these
words
were
audible
only
to
the
young
lady
herself
you
are
a
mighty
odd
set
of
people
said
she
turning
round
to
him
i
can
not
imagine
how
you
all
contrive
to
live
together
there
is
not
one
of
you
that
does
not
appear
to
be
a
contrast
to
the
other
two
then
at
any
rate
you
can
not
dislike
us
all
said
the
strange
lad
with
a
grimace
that
made
her
laugh
despite
her
inclination
to
look
grave
i
do
not
know
that
was
the
reply
i
may
dislike
you
all
equally
and
yet
have
a
different
species
of
dislike
for
each
but
one
species
must
be
stronger
and
more
vigorous
than
the
others
besides
i
will
assist
your
judgment
i
do
not
mean
to
say
i
am
quite
perfect
but
depend
upon
it
i
the
best
of
the
as
you
call
us
your
authority
jacob
is
the
best
in
the
world
certainly
nevertheless
there
are
many
who
on
such
an
occasion
might
suspect
you
of
partiality
then
they
would
do
me
great
injustice
miss
torrington
i
am
a
man
or
a
boy
or
something
between
both
take
me
for
all
in
all
it
is
five
hundred
to
one
you
shall
look
upon
my
like
again
but
that
is
a
and
sinful
quotation
miss
rosalind
like
your
name
so
be
merciful
unto
me
and
please
not
to
tell
my
papa
you
may
be
very
certain
jacob
that
i
shall
obey
you
in
this
sweetest
nut
hath
sourest
rind
such
a
nut
is
rosalind
responded
the
youth
and
probably
thinking
that
he
had
fairly
won
his
five
shillings
he
raised
his
tall
thin
person
from
the
position
which
had
so
well
pleased
his
father
and
stole
round
to
the
sofa
on
which
fanny
was
sitting
fanny
was
looking
very
lovely
but
without
a
trace
of
that
bright
and
beaming
animation
which
a
few
short
months
before
had
led
her
poor
father
to
give
her
the
of
firefly
he
was
wont
to
declare
and
no
one
was
inclined
to
contradict
him
that
whenever
she
appeared
something
like
a
bright
coruscation
seemed
to
flash
upon
the
eye
no
one
not
even
a
fond
father
would
have
hit
upon
such
a
simile
for
her
now
beautiful
she
was
perhaps
more
beautiful
than
ever
but
a
sad
and
sombre
thoughtfulness
had
settled
itself
on
her
young
brow
her
voice
was
no
longer
the
echo
of
gay
thoughts
and
in
a
word
her
whole
aspect
and
bearing
were
changed
she
now
sat
silently
apart
from
the
company
watching
with
an
air
that
seemed
to
hover
between
abstraction
and
curiosity
simpson
manner
of
making
herself
agreeable
to
cartwright
this
lady
was
seated
on
one
side
of
the
vicar
and
miss
richards
on
the
other
both
had
the
appearance
of
being
unconscious
that
any
other
person
or
persons
were
in
the
room
and
nothing
but
his
consummate
skill
in
the
art
of
uttering
an
aside
both
with
eyes
and
lips
could
have
enabled
him
to
sustain
his
position
my
sisters
and
i
are
afraid
you
have
quite
forgotten
us
murmured
miss
richards
but
we
have
been
practising
the
hymns
you
gave
us
and
we
are
all
quite
perfect
and
ready
to
sing
them
to
you
whenever
you
come
the
hearing
this
my
dear
young
lady
gives
me
as
pure
and
holy
a
pleasure
as
listening
to
the
sacred
strains
could
do
unless
indeed
he
added
bending
his
head
sideways
towards
her
so
as
nearly
to
touch
her
cheek
unless
indeed
they
were
breathed
by
the
lips
of
louisa
herself
that
must
be
very
like
hearing
a
seraph
sing
not
a
syllable
of
this
was
heard
save
by
herself
i
have
thought
incessantly
said
simpson
in
a
very
low
voice
as
soon
as
cartwright
head
had
recovered
the
perpendicular
incessantly
i
may
truly
say
on
our
last
conversation
my
life
has
been
passed
in
a
manner
so
widely
different
from
what
i
am
sure
it
will
be
in
future
that
i
feel
as
if
i
were
awakened
to
a
new
existence
the
great
object
of
my
hopes
is
and
will
ever
be
replied
the
vicar
of
wrexhill
almost
aloud
to
lead
my
beloved
flock
to
sweet
and
safe
and
for
you
he
added
in
a
voice
so
low
that
she
rather
felt
than
heard
his
words
what
is
there
i
would
not
do
here
his
eyes
spoke
a
commentary
and
hers
a
note
upon
it
which
is
the
hymn
cartwright
that
you
think
best
adapted
to
the
sabbath
you
recommended
us
to
institute
said
miss
richards
the
eleventh
i
yes
the
eleventh
study
that
my
dear
child
early
and
late
let
your
sweet
voice
breathe
those
words
and
i
will
be
with
you
in
spirit
louisa
not
even
simpson
heard
a
word
of
this
beyond
dear
child
but
when
shall
i
see
you
i
have
doubts
and
difficulties
on
some
points
cartwright
said
the
widow
aloud
how
shamefully
ignorant
i
must
call
it
ignorant
did
poor
wallace
suffer
us
to
remain
is
it
not
true
louisa
did
he
ever
through
all
the
years
we
have
known
him
utter
an
awakening
word
to
any
of
us
no
he
never
did
replied
miss
louisa
in
a
sort
of
penitent
whine
i
am
rather
surprised
to
hear
you
say
that
miss
richards
said
rosalind
drawing
her
chair
a
little
towards
them
i
always
understood
that
wallace
was
one
of
the
most
exemplary
parish
priests
in
england
did
not
your
father
consider
him
to
be
so
fanny
i
i
believe
so
i
do
know
replied
fanny
stammering
and
colouring
painfully
not
know
fanny
mowbray
exclaimed
rosalind
not
know
your
opinion
of
wallace
that
is
very
singular
indeed
i
mean
said
fanny
struggling
to
recover
her
composure
that
i
never
heard
papa
opinion
of
him
as
compared
with
with
any
one
else
i
do
not
believe
he
would
have
lost
by
the
comparison
said
rosalind
rising
and
walking
out
of
the
window
is
not
that
prodigiously
rich
young
lady
somewhat
of
the
tiger
breed
said
young
cartwright
in
a
whisper
to
fanny
miss
torrington
is
not
at
all
a
person
of
serious
notions
replied
fanny
and
till
one
is
subdued
by
religion
one
is
often
very
quarrelsome
i
am
sure
serious
or
not
you
would
never
quarrel
with
any
one
whispered
jacob
indeed
i
should
be
sorry
and
ashamed
to
do
so
now
she
replied
your
father
ought
to
cure
us
all
of
such
unchristian
faults
as
that
i
wish
i
was
like
my
father
said
jacob
very
sentimentally
oh
how
glad
i
am
to
hear
you
say
that
said
fanny
clasping
her
hands
together
i
am
sure
it
would
make
him
so
happy
i
ca
say
i
was
thinking
of
making
him
happy
miss
fanny
i
only
meant
that
i
wished
i
was
like
any
body
that
you
admire
and
approve
so
much
a
poor
silly
motive
for
wishing
to
be
like
such
a
father
replied
fanny
blushing
and
leaving
her
distant
place
she
established
herself
at
the
table
on
which
the
tea
equipage
had
just
been
placed
and
busied
herself
with
the
this
remove
brought
her
very
nearly
opposite
cartwright
and
the
two
ladies
who
were
seated
beside
him
and
from
this
moment
the
conversation
proceeded
without
any
asides
whatever
at
what
age
cartwright
said
simpson
do
you
think
one
should
begin
to
instil
the
doctrine
of
regeneration
into
a
little
girl
not
later
than
ten
my
dear
lady
a
very
quick
and
forward
child
might
perhaps
be
led
to
comprehend
it
earlier
eight
and
i
have
known
in
a
state
of
the
most
perfect
awakening
but
this
i
hold
to
be
rare
what
a
spectacle
exclaimed
miss
richards
in
a
sort
of
rapture
a
child
of
eight
and
did
it
speak
its
thoughts
mr
cartwright
the
case
i
allude
to
my
dear
young
lady
was
published
i
will
bring
you
the
pamphlet
nothing
can
be
more
edifying
than
the
of
the
spirit
through
the
organs
of
that
chosen
little
vessel
i
hope
cartwright
that
shall
have
the
benefit
of
this
dear
pamphlet
also
do
not
forget
that
i
have
a
little
girl
exactly
eight
years
and
six
i
beg
your
pardon
my
dear
louisa
but
this
must
be
so
much
more
interesting
to
me
than
it
can
be
to
you
as
yet
my
dear
that
i
trust
cartwright
will
give
me
the
precedence
in
point
of
time
besides
you
know
that
as
the
principal
person
in
the
village
i
am
a
little
spoiled
in
such
matters
i
confess
to
you
i
should
feel
hurt
if
i
had
to
wait
for
this
till
you
had
studied
it
you
have
no
child
you
know
oh
without
doubt
simpson
you
ought
to
have
it
first
replied
miss
richards
i
am
certainly
not
likely
as
yet
to
have
any
one
soul
to
be
anxious
about
but
my
is
this
blessed
child
alive
mr
cartwright
in
heaven
miss
louisa
not
on
earth
it
is
the
account
of
its
last
moments
that
have
been
so
admirably
drawn
up
by
the
reverend
josiah
martin
this
gentleman
is
a
particular
friend
of
mine
and
i
am
much
interested
in
the
sale
of
the
little
work
i
will
have
the
pleasure
my
dear
ladies
of
bringing
a
dozen
copies
to
each
of
you
and
you
will
give
me
a
very
pleasing
proof
of
the
pious
feeling
i
so
deeply
rejoice
to
see
if
you
will
dispose
of
them
at
one
shilling
each
among
your
friends
i
am
sure
i
will
try
all
i
can
said
miss
richards
my
influence
could
not
be
better
employed
i
am
certain
than
in
forwarding
your
wishes
in
all
things
added
simpson
young
jacob
either
in
the
hope
of
amusement
or
of
more
certainly
securing
his
five
shillings
had
followed
the
indignant
rosalind
out
of
the
window
and
found
her
refreshing
herself
by
arranging
the
vagrant
tendrils
of
a
beautiful
creeping
plant
outside
it
i
am
afraid
miss
rosalind
torrington
said
he
that
you
would
not
say
amen
if
i
did
say
may
the
saints
have
you
in
their
holy
keeping
i
do
believe
in
my
heart
that
you
would
rather
find
yourself
in
the
keeping
of
sinners
the
meaning
of
words
often
depends
upon
the
character
of
those
who
utter
them
replied
rosalind
there
is
such
a
thing
as
slang
jacob
and
there
is
such
a
thing
as
cant
did
you
ever
mention
that
to
my
papa
miss
rosalind
inquired
jacob
in
a
voice
of
great
simplicity
rosalind
looked
at
him
as
if
she
wished
to
discover
what
he
was
at
whether
his
object
were
to
quiz
her
his
father
or
both
but
considering
his
very
boyish
appearance
and
manner
there
was
more
difficulty
in
achieving
this
than
might
have
been
expected
sometimes
she
thought
him
almost
a
fool
at
others
quite
a
wag
at
one
moment
she
was
ready
to
believe
him
more
than
commonly
and
at
another
felt
persuaded
that
he
was
an
accomplished
hypocrite
it
is
probable
that
the
youth
perceived
her
purpose
and
felt
more
gratification
in
defeating
it
than
he
could
have
done
from
any
of
which
she
were
the
object
his
countenance
which
was
certainly
intended
by
nature
to
express
little
besides
frolic
and
fun
was
now
puckered
up
into
a
look
of
solemnity
that
might
have
befitted
one
of
the
congregation
when
awaiting
an
address
in
the
unknown
tongue
i
am
sure
he
said
that
my
papa
would
like
to
hear
you
talk
about
all
those
things
very
much
miss
torrington
i
do
not
think
that
he
would
exactly
agree
with
you
in
every
word
you
might
say
but
that
never
seems
to
vex
him
if
the
talk
does
but
go
about
heaven
and
hell
and
saints
and
sinners
and
reprobation
and
regeneration
and
the
old
man
and
the
new
birth
that
is
all
papa
cares
for
i
think
he
likes
to
be
contradicted
a
little
for
that
you
know
makes
more
talk
again
is
that
the
principle
upon
which
you
proceed
with
him
yourself
jacob
do
you
always
make
a
point
of
contradicting
every
thing
he
says
pretty
generally
miss
torrington
when
there
is
nobody
by
and
when
i
make
it
all
pass
for
joke
but
there
a
law
that
even
miss
henrietta
has
been
taught
to
obey
and
that
is
never
to
contradict
him
in
company
perhaps
you
have
found
that
out
miss
rosalind
perhaps
i
have
mr
jacob
will
you
not
come
in
to
tea
miss
torrington
said
henrietta
appearing
at
the
window
with
the
volume
in
her
hand
which
had
seemed
to
occupy
her
whole
attention
from
the
time
she
had
the
with
rosalind
i
wish
sister
said
jacob
affecting
to
look
extremely
cross
that
you
would
not
pop
out
so
to
interrupt
one
conversation
you
might
have
a
fellow
feeling
i
think
for
a
young
lady
when
she
walks
out
of
a
window
and
a
young
gentleman
walks
after
her
rosalind
gave
him
a
look
from
one
side
and
henrietta
from
the
other
mercy
on
me
he
exclaimed
putting
up
his
hands
as
if
to
guard
the
two
sides
of
his
face
four
black
eyes
at
me
at
once
and
so
very
black
in
every
sense
of
the
word
the
young
ladies
walked
together
into
the
room
and
jacob
followed
seeking
the
eye
of
his
father
and
receiving
thence
as
he
expected
a
glance
of
encouragement
and
applause
when
the
tea
was
removed
cartwright
went
to
the
and
run
his
fingers
with
an
appearance
of
some
skill
over
the
keys
i
hope
my
dear
miss
fanny
that
you
intend
we
should
have
a
little
music
this
evening
if
simpson
miss
richards
and
miss
torrington
will
sing
said
fanny
i
shall
be
very
happy
to
accompany
them
what
music
have
you
got
my
dear
young
lady
said
the
vicar
miss
torrington
had
a
large
collection
of
songs
very
commodiously
stowed
beneath
the
instrument
and
helen
and
herself
were
nearly
as
amply
provided
with
music
of
all
kinds
but
though
this
was
the
first
time
cartwright
had
ever
approached
the
instrument
or
asked
for
music
fanny
had
a
sort
of
instinctive
consciousness
that
the
collection
would
be
found
defective
in
his
eyes
we
have
several
of
handel
oratorios
she
replied
and
i
think
helen
has
got
the
very
fine
music
both
replied
cartwright
but
in
the
social
meetings
of
friends
where
many
perhaps
may
be
able
to
raise
a
timid
note
toward
heaven
though
incapable
of
performing
the
difficult
compositions
of
these
great
masters
i
conceive
that
a
simpler
style
is
preferable
if
you
will
permit
me
he
continued
drawing
a
small
volume
of
manuscript
music
from
his
pocket
i
will
point
out
to
you
some
very
beautiful
and
indeed
popular
melodies
which
have
heretofore
been
sadly
disgraced
by
the
words
applied
to
them
in
this
little
book
many
of
my
female
friends
have
at
my
request
written
words
fit
for
a
christian
to
sing
to
notes
that
the
sweet
voice
of
youth
and
beauty
may
love
to
breathe
miss
torrington
i
have
heard
that
you
are
considered
to
be
a
very
superior
vocalist
will
you
use
the
power
that
god
has
given
to
hymn
his
praise
there
was
too
much
genuine
piety
in
rosalind
heart
to
refuse
a
challenge
so
worded
without
a
better
reason
for
doing
it
than
personal
dislike
to
cartwright
nevertheless
it
was
not
without
putting
some
constraint
upon
herself
that
she
replied
i
very
often
sing
sacred
music
sir
and
am
ready
to
do
so
now
if
you
wish
it
a
thousand
thanks
said
he
for
this
amiable
compliance
i
hail
it
as
the
harbinger
of
harmony
that
shall
rise
from
all
our
hearts
in
sweet
accord
to
heaven
rosalind
coloured
and
her
heart
whispered
i
will
not
be
a
hypocrite
but
she
had
agreed
to
sing
and
she
prepared
to
do
so
seeking
among
her
volumes
for
one
of
the
easiest
and
shortest
of
handel
songs
and
determined
when
she
had
finished
to
make
her
escape
while
she
was
thus
employed
however
cartwright
was
equally
active
in
turning
over
the
leaves
of
his
pocket
companion
and
before
miss
torrington
had
made
her
selection
he
placed
the
tiny
manuscript
volume
open
upon
the
instrument
saying
there
my
dear
young
lady
this
is
an
air
and
these
are
words
which
we
may
all
listen
to
with
equal
innocence
and
delight
rosalind
was
provoked
but
every
one
in
the
room
had
already
crowded
round
the
piano
and
having
no
inclination
to
enter
upon
any
discussion
she
sat
down
prepared
to
sing
whatever
was
placed
before
her
the
air
was
undeniably
a
popular
one
being
no
other
than
fly
not
yet
which
as
all
the
world
knows
has
been
performed
to
millions
of
delighted
listeners
in
lofty
halls
and
tiny
and
moreover
ground
upon
every
in
great
britain
for
many
years
past
rosalind
ran
her
eyes
over
the
words
which
in
fair
feminine
characters
were
written
beneath
the
notes
as
follow
fly
not
yet
is
just
the
hour
when
prayerful
christians
own
the
power
that
inly
beaming
with
new
light
begins
to
sanctify
the
night
for
maids
who
love
the
moon
oh
pray
oh
pray
is
but
to
bless
these
hours
of
shade
that
pious
songs
and
hymns
are
made
for
now
their
holy
ardour
glowing
sets
the
soul
emotion
flowing
oh
pray
oh
pray
prayer
so
seldom
breathes
a
strain
so
sweet
as
this
that
oh
is
pain
to
check
its
voice
too
soon
oh
pray
oh
pray
an
expression
of
almost
awful
indignation
rose
to
the
eyes
of
rosalind
do
you
give
me
this
sir
she
said
as
a
jest
or
do
you
propose
that
i
should
sing
it
as
an
act
of
devotion
cartwright
withdrew
the
little
book
and
immediately
returned
it
to
his
pocket
i
am
sorry
miss
torrington
that
you
should
have
asked
me
such
a
question
he
replied
with
a
kind
of
gentle
severity
which
might
have
led
almost
any
hearer
to
think
him
in
the
right
i
had
hoped
that
my
ministry
at
wrexhill
short
as
it
has
been
could
not
have
left
it
a
matter
of
doubt
whether
in
speaking
of
singing
or
prayer
i
was
in
jest
nevertheless
sir
rejoined
rosalind
it
does
to
me
appear
like
a
jest
and
a
very
indecent
one
too
thus
to
imagine
that
an
air
long
familiar
to
all
as
the
vehicle
of
words
as
full
of
levity
as
of
poetry
can
be
on
the
sudden
converted
into
an
accompaniment
to
a
solemn
invocation
to
prayer
uttered
too
in
the
form
of
a
vile
parody
i
think
that
a
very
few
words
may
be
able
to
prove
to
you
the
sophistry
of
such
an
argument
returned
the
vicar
you
will
allow
i
believe
that
this
air
is
very
generally
known
to
all
is
it
not
so
rosalind
bowed
her
assent
well
then
let
me
go
a
step
farther
and
ask
whether
the
words
originally
set
to
this
air
are
not
likely
to
be
recalled
by
hearing
it
beyond
all
doubt
now
observe
miss
torrington
that
what
you
have
been
pleased
to
call
levity
and
poetry
i
in
my
clerical
capacity
denounce
as
indecent
and
obscene
is
that
your
reason
for
setting
me
to
play
it
said
rosalind
in
a
tone
of
anger
that
question
again
does
not
i
fear
argue
an
amiable
and
pious
state
of
mind
replied
cartwright
appealing
meekly
with
his
eyes
to
the
right
and
left
it
is
to
substitute
other
thoughts
for
those
which
the
air
has
hitherto
suggested
that
i
conceive
the
singing
this
song
as
it
now
stands
desirable
might
it
not
be
as
well
to
leave
the
air
alone
altogether
said
rosalind
decidedly
not
replied
the
vicar
the
notes
as
you
have
allowed
are
already
familiar
to
all
men
and
it
is
therefore
a
duty
to
endeavour
to
make
that
familiarity
familiarly
suggest
thoughts
of
heaven
thoughts
of
heaven
said
rosalind
should
never
be
suggested
familiarly
dreadful
very
dreadful
doctrine
that
miss
torrington
and
i
must
tell
you
in
devout
assurance
of
the
truth
i
speak
that
it
is
in
order
to
combat
and
overthrow
such
notions
as
you
now
express
that
heaven
hath
vouchsafed
by
an
act
of
special
providence
to
send
upon
earth
in
these
later
days
my
humble
self
and
some
others
who
think
like
me
and
permit
me
sir
in
the
name
of
the
earthly
father
i
have
lost
replied
rosalind
while
her
eyes
overflowed
with
the
glistening
moisture
her
earnestness
brought
into
them
permit
me
in
his
reverenced
name
to
say
that
constant
prayer
can
in
no
way
be
identified
with
familiarity
of
address
and
that
of
many
lamentable
evils
which
the
class
of
preachers
to
whom
you
allude
have
brought
upon
blundering
christians
that
of
teaching
them
to
believe
that
there
is
righteousness
in
mixing
the
awful
and
majestic
name
of
god
with
all
the
hourly
petty
occurrences
of
this
mortal
life
is
one
of
the
most
deplorable
may
your
unthinking
youth
my
dear
young
lady
plead
before
the
god
of
mercy
in
mitigation
of
the
wrath
which
such
sentiments
are
calculated
to
draw
down
oh
sobbed
miss
richards
alas
sighed
simpson
how
can
you
rosalind
speak
so
to
the
pastor
and
master
of
our
souls
said
fanny
while
tears
of
sympathy
for
the
outraged
vicar
fell
from
her
beautiful
eyes
my
dear
children
my
dear
friends
said
cartwright
in
a
voice
that
seemed
to
tremble
with
affectionate
emotion
think
not
of
me
remember
the
words
are
they
which
are
persecuted
for
righteousness
sake
i
turn
not
from
the
harsh
rebuke
of
this
young
lady
albeit
i
am
not
insensible
to
its
injustice
nor
indeed
blind
to
its
indecency
but
blessed
oh
most
blessed
shall
i
hold
this
trial
if
it
lead
to
the
awakening
holy
thoughts
in
you
my
dear
young
lady
he
continued
rising
from
his
seat
and
approaching
rosalind
with
an
extended
hand
it
may
be
as
well
perhaps
that
i
withdraw
myself
at
this
moment
haply
reflection
may
soften
your
young
but
let
us
part
in
peace
as
christians
should
do
rosalind
did
not
take
his
offered
hand
in
peace
sir
she
said
decidedly
i
desire
you
to
depart
in
peace
i
have
no
wish
to
molest
you
in
any
way
but
you
must
excuse
my
not
accepting
your
proffered
hand
it
is
but
an
idle
and
unmeaning
ceremony
perhaps
as
things
go
but
the
manner
in
which
you
now
stretch
forth
your
hand
gives
a
sort
of
importance
to
it
which
would
make
it
a
species
of
falsehood
in
me
to
accept
it
when
it
means
any
thing
it
means
cordial
liking
and
this
sir
i
do
not
feel
for
you
so
saying
rosalind
arose
and
left
the
room
fanny
clasped
her
hands
in
a
perfect
agony
and
raising
her
tearful
eyes
to
heaven
as
if
to
deprecate
its
wrath
upon
the
roof
that
covered
so
great
wickedness
exclaimed
oh
cartwright
what
can
i
say
to
you
simpson
showed
symptoms
of
being
likely
to
faint
and
as
cartwright
and
fanny
approached
her
miss
richards
with
a
vehemence
of
feeling
that
seemed
to
set
language
at
defiance
seized
the
hand
of
the
persecuted
vicar
and
pressed
it
to
her
lips
several
minutes
were
given
to
the
interchange
of
emotions
too
strong
to
be
described
in
words
female
tears
were
blended
with
holy
blessings
and
as
jacob
afterwards
assured
his
sister
who
had
contrived
unobserved
to
escape
he
at
one
time
saw
no
fewer
than
eight
human
hands
great
and
small
all
mixed
together
in
a
sort
of
heap
upon
the
chair
round
which
they
at
length
kneeled
down
it
will
be
easily
believed
that
miss
torrington
appeared
no
more
that
night
and
after
an
hour
passed
in
conversation
on
the
persecutions
and
revilings
to
which
the
godly
are
exposed
simpson
who
declared
herself
dreadfully
overcome
proposed
to
miss
richards
that
they
should
use
such
strength
as
was
left
them
to
walk
home
a
very
tender
leave
was
taken
of
fanny
in
which
jacob
zealously
joined
and
the
party
set
out
for
a
walk
to
wrexhill
its
vicar
supporting
on
each
arm
a
very
nervous
and
trembling
hand
cartwright
soon
after
passing
the
desired
his
son
to
step
forward
and
order
the
clerk
to
come
to
him
on
some
urgent
parish
business
before
he
went
to
bed
the
young
man
darted
forward
nothing
loth
and
the
trio
walked
at
a
leisurely
pace
under
the
dark
shadows
of
the
that
lined
the
road
to
the
village
they
passed
behind
the
vicarage
when
the
two
ladies
simultaneously
uttered
a
sigh
and
breathed
in
a
whisper
sweet
spot
can
it
be
doubted
that
both
were
thanked
by
a
gentle
pressure
of
the
arm
the
house
of
simpson
lay
on
the
road
to
that
of
richards
and
miss
louisa
made
a
decided
halt
before
the
door
distinctly
pronouncing
at
the
same
time
good
night
my
dear
mrs
simpson
but
this
lady
knew
the
duties
of
a
chaperon
too
well
to
think
of
leaving
her
young
companion
till
she
saw
her
safely
restored
to
her
roof
oh
no
my
dear
she
exclaimed
if
your
house
were
a
mile
off
louisa
i
should
take
you
home
but
you
have
been
so
poorly
persisted
the
young
lady
and
it
is
so
unnecessary
is
returned
simpson
with
an
emphasis
that
marked
too
conscientious
a
feeling
to
be
further
resisted
so
miss
richards
was
taken
home
and
the
fair
widow
languidly
and
slowly
retraced
her
steps
to
her
own
door
with
no
other
companion
than
the
vicar
of
wrexhill
end
of
the
first
volume
volume
the
second
chapter
charles
mowbray
arrival
at
the
park
never
had
rosalind
torrington
so
strongly
felt
the
want
of
some
one
to
advise
her
what
to
do
as
the
morning
after
this
disagreeable
scene
had
she
consulted
her
inclination
only
she
would
have
remained
in
her
own
apartments
till
the
return
of
mowbray
and
helen
but
more
than
one
reason
prevented
her
doing
so
in
the
first
place
she
was
not
without
hope
that
her
letter
would
immediately
bring
young
mowbray
home
and
it
would
be
equally
disagreeable
to
miss
seeing
him
by
remaining
in
her
or
to
leave
it
expressly
for
the
purpose
of
doing
so
and
secondly
however
far
her
feelings
might
be
from
perfect
confidence
and
esteem
towards
miss
cartwright
she
felt
that
she
owed
her
something
and
that
it
would
be
ungrateful
and
almost
cruel
to
leave
her
with
the
bewildered
fanny
or
en
tiers
with
her
and
the
vicar
she
therefore
determined
to
run
the
risk
of
encountering
cartwright
as
usual
but
felt
greatly
at
a
loss
how
to
treat
him
their
last
démêlé
had
been
too
serious
to
be
forgotten
by
either
and
her
opinion
of
him
was
such
that
far
from
wishing
to
conciliate
him
or
in
any
way
to
efface
the
impression
of
what
she
had
said
on
leaving
him
her
inclination
and
her
principles
both
led
her
to
wish
that
it
should
be
indelible
and
that
nothing
should
ever
lessen
the
distance
that
was
now
placed
between
them
but
rosalind
felt
all
the
difficulty
of
maintaining
this
tone
towards
a
person
not
only
on
terms
of
intimate
friendship
with
the
family
but
considered
by
part
of
it
as
a
man
whose
word
ought
to
be
law
she
began
to
fear
as
she
meditated
on
the
position
in
which
she
was
placed
that
mowbray
park
could
not
long
continue
to
be
her
home
the
idea
of
helen
and
what
she
would
feel
at
losing
her
drew
tears
from
her
eyes
and
then
the
remembrance
of
her
irish
home
of
her
lost
parents
and
the
terrible
contrast
between
what
she
had
heard
last
night
and
the
lessons
and
opinions
of
her
dear
father
made
them
flow
abundantly
the
day
passed
heavily
miss
cartwright
appeared
to
think
she
had
done
enough
and
devoted
herself
almost
wholly
to
the
perusal
of
a
french
metaphysical
work
which
she
had
found
in
the
library
fanny
was
silent
and
sad
and
seemed
carefully
to
avoid
being
left
for
a
moment
alone
with
rosalind
cartwright
made
no
visit
to
the
house
during
the
morning
but
judy
informed
her
mistress
when
she
came
to
arrange
her
dress
for
dinner
that
the
reverend
gentleman
had
been
walking
in
the
shrubberies
with
miss
fanny
and
in
the
evening
he
made
his
entrance
as
usual
through
the
window
it
was
the
result
of
a
strong
effort
produced
by
very
excellent
feeling
that
kept
rosalind
in
the
room
when
she
saw
him
approach
but
she
had
little
doubt
that
if
she
went
miss
cartwright
would
follow
her
and
she
resolved
that
his
pernicious
with
fanny
should
not
be
rendered
more
frequent
by
any
selfishness
of
hers
it
was
evident
to
her
from
cartwright
manner
through
the
whole
evening
that
it
was
his
intention
to
overload
her
with
gentle
kindness
in
order
to
set
off
in
strong
relief
her
harsh
and
persecuting
spirit
towards
him
but
not
even
her
wish
to
defeat
this
plan
could
enable
her
to
do
more
than
answer
by
civil
monosyllables
when
he
spoke
to
her
miss
cartwright
laid
aside
her
book
and
resumed
her
netting
as
soon
as
she
saw
him
approach
but
as
usual
she
sat
silent
and
abstracted
and
the
conversation
was
wholly
carried
on
by
the
vicar
and
his
pretty
proselyte
no
man
perhaps
had
a
greater
facility
in
making
conversation
than
the
vicar
of
wrexhill
his
habit
of
extempore
preaching
in
which
he
was
thought
by
many
to
excel
probably
contributed
to
give
him
this
power
but
not
only
had
he
an
endless
flow
of
words
wherewith
to
clothe
whatever
thoughts
suggested
themselves
but
moreover
a
most
happy
faculty
of
turning
every
thing
around
him
to
account
every
object
animate
or
inanimate
furnished
him
a
theme
and
let
him
begin
from
what
point
he
would
unless
in
the
presence
of
noble
or
influential
personages
to
whom
he
believed
it
would
be
distasteful
he
never
failed
to
bring
the
conversation
round
to
the
subject
of
regeneration
and
grace
the
blessed
hopes
of
himself
and
his
sect
and
the
assured
damnation
of
all
the
rest
of
the
world
fanny
mowbray
listened
to
him
with
an
earnestness
that
amounted
to
nervous
anxiety
lest
she
should
lose
a
word
his
awful
dogmas
had
taken
fearful
hold
of
her
ardent
and
imagination
while
his
bland
and
affectionate
manner
his
fine
features
and
graceful
person
rendered
him
altogether
an
object
of
the
most
unbounded
admiration
and
interest
to
her
as
an
additional
proof
probably
that
he
did
not
shrink
from
persecution
cartwright
again
opened
the
as
soon
as
the
tea
equipage
was
removed
and
asked
fanny
if
she
would
sing
with
him
with
you
mr
cartwright
she
exclaimed
in
an
accent
of
glad
surprise
i
did
not
know
that
you
sang
oh
how
i
wish
that
i
were
a
greater
proficient
that
i
might
sing
with
you
as
i
would
wish
to
do
sing
with
me
my
dear
child
with
that
sweet
and
pious
feeling
which
i
rejoice
to
see
hourly
increasing
in
your
heart
sing
thus
my
dearest
child
and
you
will
need
no
greater
skill
than
heaven
is
sure
to
give
to
all
who
raise
their
voice
to
it
this
little
book
my
dear
miss
fanny
he
continued
drawing
once
more
the
manuscript
volume
from
his
pocket
contains
much
that
your
pure
and
innocent
heart
will
approve
do
you
know
this
air
and
he
pointed
to
the
notes
of
là
ci
darem
la
mano
oh
yes
said
fanny
i
know
it
very
well
then
play
it
my
good
child
this
too
we
have
taken
as
spoil
from
the
enemy
and
instead
of
profane
italian
words
you
will
here
find
in
your
own
language
thoughts
that
may
be
spoken
without
fear
fanny
instantly
complied
and
though
her
power
of
singing
was
greatly
inferior
to
that
of
rosalind
the
performance
aided
by
the
fine
bass
voice
of
cartwright
and
an
accompaniment
very
correctly
played
was
very
agreeable
fanny
herself
thought
she
had
never
sung
so
well
before
and
required
only
to
be
told
by
the
vicar
what
she
was
to
do
next
to
prolong
the
performance
till
considerably
past
cartwright
usual
hour
of
retiring
about
an
hour
after
the
singing
began
henrietta
approached
miss
torrington
and
said
in
a
whisper
too
low
to
be
heard
at
the
instrument
my
head
aches
dreadfully
can
you
spare
me
as
she
had
not
spoken
a
single
syllable
since
the
trio
entered
the
after
dinner
rosalind
could
not
wholly
refrain
from
a
smile
as
she
replied
why
yes
i
think
i
can
i
am
not
jesting
i
am
suffering
rosalind
you
will
not
leave
that
girl
alone
with
him
dear
henrietta
cried
rosalind
taking
her
hand
with
ready
sympathy
i
will
not
should
they
sing
together
till
morning
but
is
there
nothing
i
can
do
for
you
nothing
i
can
give
you
that
may
relieve
your
head
nothing
nothing
good
night
and
she
glided
out
of
the
room
unseen
by
fanny
and
unregarded
by
her
father
it
more
than
once
occurred
to
miss
torrington
during
the
two
tedious
hours
that
followed
her
departure
that
cartwright
who
from
time
to
time
stole
a
glance
at
her
prolonged
his
canticles
for
the
purpose
of
making
her
sit
to
hear
them
a
species
of
penance
for
her
last
offence
by
no
means
ill
imagined
at
length
however
he
departed
and
after
exchanging
a
formal
good
night
the
young
ladies
retired
to
their
separate
apartments
rosalind
rose
with
a
heavy
heart
the
following
morning
hardly
knowing
whether
to
wish
for
a
letter
from
charles
mowbray
which
it
was
just
possible
the
post
might
bring
her
or
not
if
a
letter
arrived
there
would
certainly
be
no
hope
of
seeing
him
but
if
it
did
not
she
should
fancy
every
sound
she
heard
foretold
his
approach
and
she
almost
dreaded
the
having
to
answer
all
the
questions
he
would
come
prepared
to
ask
this
state
of
suspense
however
did
not
last
long
for
at
least
one
hour
before
it
was
possible
that
a
letter
could
arrive
charles
mowbray
in
a
chaise
with
four
foaming
rattled
up
to
the
door
rosalind
descried
him
from
her
window
before
he
reached
the
house
and
her
first
feeling
was
certainly
one
of
embarrassment
as
she
remembered
that
it
was
her
summons
which
had
brought
him
there
but
a
reflection
not
only
recalled
her
motives
but
the
additional
reasons
she
now
had
for
believing
she
had
acted
wisely
so
arming
herself
with
the
consciousness
of
being
right
she
hastened
down
stairs
to
meet
him
in
preference
to
receiving
a
message
through
a
servant
requesting
to
see
her
she
found
him
as
she
expected
in
a
state
of
considerable
agitation
and
alarm
and
feeling
most
truly
anxious
to
remove
whatever
portion
of
this
was
unnecessary
she
greeted
him
with
the
most
cheerful
aspect
she
could
assume
saying
i
fear
my
letter
has
terrified
you
mowbray
more
than
i
wished
it
to
do
but
be
quite
sure
that
now
you
are
here
every
thing
will
go
on
as
it
ought
to
do
and
of
course
when
your
mother
returns
we
can
neither
of
us
have
any
farther
cause
of
anxiety
about
fanny
and
what
is
your
cause
of
anxiety
about
her
at
present
miss
torrington
for
heaven
sake
explain
yourself
fully
you
know
not
how
i
have
been
tormenting
myself
by
fearing
i
know
not
what
i
am
bound
to
explain
myself
fully
said
rosalind
gravely
but
it
is
not
easy
i
assure
you
only
tell
me
at
once
what
it
is
you
fear
do
you
imagine
cartwright
hopes
to
persuade
fanny
to
marry
him
i
certainly
did
think
so
said
rosalind
but
i
believe
now
that
i
was
mistaken
thank
heaven
cried
the
young
man
fervently
this
is
a
great
relief
rosalind
i
assure
you
i
believe
now
i
can
pretty
well
guess
what
it
is
you
do
fear
and
though
it
is
provoking
enough
it
can
not
greatly
signify
we
shall
soon
cure
her
of
any
fit
of
evangelicalism
with
which
the
vicar
is
likely
to
infect
her
heaven
grant
it
exclaimed
rosalind
uttering
a
fervent
ejaculation
in
her
turn
never
doubt
it
miss
torrington
i
have
heard
a
great
deal
about
this
cartwright
at
oxford
he
is
a
cambridge
man
by
the
way
and
there
are
lots
of
men
there
who
think
him
quite
an
apostle
but
the
thing
does
not
take
at
oxford
and
i
assure
you
he
is
famously
quizzed
but
the
best
of
the
joke
is
that
his
son
was
within
an
ace
of
being
expelled
for
performing
more
outrageous
feats
in
the
larking
line
than
any
man
in
the
university
and
in
fact
he
must
have
been
rusticated
had
not
his
pious
father
taken
him
home
before
the
business
got
wind
prepare
him
privately
for
his
they
say
he
is
the
greatest
pickle
in
oxford
and
that
spite
of
the
new
light
his
father
is
such
an
ass
as
to
believe
that
all
this
is
ordained
only
to
make
his
election
more
glorious
for
his
election
mowbray
i
certainly
do
not
care
much
but
for
your
sister
though
i
am
aware
that
at
her
age
there
may
be
very
reasonable
hope
that
the
pernicious
opinions
she
is
now
imbibing
may
be
hereafter
removed
yet
i
am
very
strongly
persuaded
that
if
you
were
quite
aware
of
the
sort
of
influence
used
to
convert
her
to
cartwright
calvinistic
tenets
you
would
not
only
disapprove
it
but
use
very
effectual
measures
to
put
her
quite
out
of
his
way
indeed
i
confess
this
appears
to
me
very
unnecessary
surely
the
best
mode
of
working
upon
so
pure
a
mind
as
fanny
is
to
reason
with
her
and
to
show
her
that
by
listening
to
those
pernicious
rhapsodies
she
is
in
fact
withdrawing
herself
from
the
church
of
her
fathers
but
i
think
this
may
be
done
without
sending
her
out
of
cartwright
way
well
replied
rosalind
very
meekly
now
you
are
here
i
am
quite
sure
that
you
will
do
every
thing
that
is
right
and
proper
mowbray
can
not
be
much
longer
absent
and
when
she
returns
you
will
perhaps
have
some
conversation
with
her
upon
the
subject
and
so
sir
gilbert
has
absolutely
refused
to
act
as
executor
he
has
indeed
and
spite
of
the
most
earnest
entreaties
from
helen
whatever
mischief
happens
i
shall
always
think
he
is
answerable
for
it
for
his
refusal
to
act
threw
your
mother
at
once
upon
seeking
counsel
from
cartwright
as
to
what
it
was
necessary
for
her
to
do
and
from
that
hour
the
house
has
never
been
free
from
him
for
a
single
day
provoking
obstinacy
replied
mowbray
yet
after
all
rosalind
the
worst
mischief
as
you
call
it
that
can
happen
is
our
not
being
on
such
pleasant
terms
with
them
as
we
used
to
be
and
the
colonel
is
at
home
too
i
must
and
will
see
him
let
the
old
man
be
as
cross
as
he
but
where
is
your
little
saint
you
do
keep
her
locked
up
i
hope
rosalind
and
where
is
this
miss
of
the
new
birth
that
you
told
me
of
young
mowbray
threw
a
melancholy
glance
round
the
empty
room
as
he
spoke
and
the
rosalind
understood
his
feelings
and
truly
pitied
him
how
different
was
this
return
home
from
any
other
he
had
ever
made
the
room
looks
desolate
does
it
not
mr
mowbray
even
i
feel
it
so
i
will
go
and
let
fanny
know
you
are
here
but
what
reason
shall
i
assign
for
your
return
none
at
all
miss
torrington
the
whim
took
me
and
i
am
here
things
are
so
much
better
than
i
expected
that
i
shall
probably
be
back
again
in
a
day
or
two
but
i
must
contrive
to
see
young
harrington
rosalind
left
the
room
heartily
glad
that
fanny
brother
was
near
her
but
not
without
some
feeling
of
mortification
at
the
little
importance
he
appeared
to
attach
to
the
information
she
had
given
him
a
few
short
weeks
before
rosalind
would
have
entered
fanny
room
with
as
much
freedom
as
her
own
but
the
schism
which
has
unhappily
entered
so
many
english
houses
under
the
semblance
of
superior
piety
was
rapidly
doing
its
work
at
mowbray
park
and
the
true
friend
the
familiar
companion
the
faithful
counsellor
stood
upon
the
threshold
and
ventured
not
to
enter
till
she
had
announced
her
approach
by
a
knock
at
the
door
come
in
was
uttered
in
a
gentle
and
almost
plaintive
voice
by
fanny
miss
torrington
entered
and
to
her
great
astonishment
saw
cartwright
seated
beside
fanny
a
large
bible
lying
open
on
the
table
before
them
she
looked
at
them
for
one
moment
without
speaking
the
vicar
spread
his
open
hand
upon
the
volume
as
if
to
point
out
the
cause
of
his
being
there
and
as
his
other
hand
covered
the
lower
part
of
his
face
the
expression
of
his
countenance
was
concealed
fanny
coloured
violently
and
the
more
so
perhaps
because
she
was
conscious
that
her
appearance
was
considerably
changed
since
she
met
miss
torrington
at
breakfast
all
her
beautiful
curls
had
been
carefully
straightened
by
the
application
of
a
wet
sponge
and
her
hair
was
now
entirely
removed
from
her
forehead
and
plastered
down
behind
her
poor
little
distorted
ears
as
closely
as
possible
never
was
metamorphosis
more
complete
beautiful
as
her
features
were
the
lovely
picture
which
fanny
face
used
to
present
to
the
eye
required
her
bright
waving
locks
to
complete
its
charm
and
without
them
she
looked
more
like
a
chinese
beauty
on
a
japan
skreen
than
like
herself
something
approaching
to
a
smile
passed
over
rosalind
features
which
the
more
readily
found
place
there
perhaps
from
the
belief
that
charles
arrival
would
soon
set
her
ringlets
curling
again
fanny
your
brother
is
come
said
she
and
he
is
waiting
for
you
in
the
charles
cried
fanny
forgetting
for
a
moment
her
new
character
and
hastily
rising
she
had
almost
quitted
the
room
when
she
recollected
herself
and
turning
back
said
you
will
come
too
to
see
charles
mr
cartwright
i
will
come
as
usual
this
evening
my
dear
child
said
he
with
the
appearance
of
great
composure
but
i
will
not
break
in
upon
him
now
was
his
return
expected
he
added
carelessly
as
he
took
up
his
hat
and
as
he
spoke
rosalind
thought
that
his
eye
glanced
towards
her
no
indeed
replied
fanny
i
never
was
more
surprised
did
he
say
rosalind
what
it
was
brought
him
home
i
asked
him
to
state
his
reason
for
it
replied
miss
torrington
and
he
told
me
he
could
assign
nothing
but
whim
rosalind
looked
in
the
face
of
the
vicar
as
she
said
this
and
she
perceived
a
slight
but
to
her
perfectly
perceptible
change
in
its
expression
he
was
evidently
relieved
from
some
uneasy
feeling
or
suspicion
by
what
she
had
said
go
to
your
brother
my
dear
child
let
me
not
detain
you
from
so
happy
a
meeting
for
a
moment
fanny
again
prepared
to
leave
the
room
but
as
she
did
so
her
eye
chanced
to
rest
upon
her
own
figure
reflected
from
a
mirror
above
the
she
raised
her
hand
almost
involuntarily
to
her
hair
will
not
charles
think
me
looking
very
strangely
said
she
turning
towards
cartwright
with
a
blushing
cheek
and
very
bashful
eye
he
whispered
something
in
her
ear
in
reply
which
heightened
her
blush
and
induced
her
to
answer
with
great
earnestness
oh
no
and
without
farther
doubt
or
delay
she
ran
down
stairs
miss
torrington
followed
her
not
thinking
it
necessary
to
take
any
leave
of
the
vicar
who
gently
found
his
way
down
stairs
and
out
of
the
house
as
he
had
found
his
way
into
it
without
troubling
any
servant
whatever
chapter
ii
charles
amusement
at
his
sister
he
discusses
her
case
with
rosalind
rosalind
and
fanny
entered
the
together
and
young
mowbray
at
the
sound
of
their
approach
sprang
forward
to
meet
them
but
the
moment
he
threw
his
eyes
on
his
sister
he
burst
forth
into
a
fit
of
uncontrollable
laughter
and
though
he
kissed
her
again
and
again
still
between
every
embrace
he
broke
out
anew
with
every
demonstration
of
vehement
mirth
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
charles
said
fanny
with
a
little
sanctified
air
that
certainly
was
very
amusing
but
i
should
like
it
better
if
you
did
not
laugh
at
me
but
my
dear
dear
dearest
child
how
can
i
help
it
replied
her
brother
again
bursting
into
renewed
laughter
oh
fanny
if
you
could
but
see
yourself
just
as
you
look
at
this
moment
oh
you
hideous
little
quiz
i
would
not
have
believed
it
possible
that
any
plastering
or
shearing
in
the
world
could
have
made
you
look
so
very
ugly
is
it
not
wonderful
miss
torrington
it
certainly
alters
the
expression
of
her
countenance
in
a
very
remarkable
manner
replied
rosalind
the
expression
of
a
countenance
may
be
changed
by
an
alteration
from
within
as
well
as
from
without
said
fanny
taking
courage
and
not
without
some
little
feeling
of
that
complacency
which
the
persuasion
of
superior
sanctity
is
generally
observed
to
bestow
upon
its
possessors
why
you
most
ugly
little
beauty
cried
charles
again
giving
way
to
merriment
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
that
the
absurdity
of
that
poor
little
face
is
owing
to
any
thing
but
your
having
just
washed
your
hair
it
is
owing
to
conviction
charles
replied
fanny
with
great
solemnity
owing
to
conviction
to
conviction
of
what
my
poor
little
girl
to
conviction
that
it
is
right
brother
right
child
to
make
that
object
of
yourself
what
in
the
world
can
you
mean
fanny
i
mean
brother
that
i
have
an
inward
conviction
of
the
sin
and
folly
of
dressing
our
mortal
clay
to
attract
the
eyes
and
the
admiration
of
the
worldly
by
worldly
do
you
mean
of
all
the
world
said
rosalind
no
miss
torrington
by
worldly
i
mean
those
whose
thoughts
and
wishes
are
fixed
on
the
things
of
the
earth
and
it
is
the
admiration
of
such
only
that
you
wish
to
avoid
rejoined
rosalind
certainly
it
is
persons
see
all
things
in
the
spirit
do
all
things
in
the
spirit
of
such
there
is
nothing
to
fear
young
mowbray
meanwhile
stood
looking
at
his
sister
and
listening
to
her
words
with
the
most
earnest
attention
at
length
he
said
more
seriously
than
he
had
yet
spoken
to
tell
you
the
truth
little
puritan
i
do
not
like
you
at
all
in
your
new
masquerading
suit
though
it
must
be
confessed
that
you
play
your
part
well
i
do
want
to
begin
lecturing
you
fanny
the
moment
i
come
home
but
i
do
hope
you
will
soon
get
tired
of
this
foolery
and
let
me
see
my
poor
father
daughter
look
and
behave
as
a
christian
young
woman
ought
to
do
rosalind
will
you
take
a
walk
with
me
i
want
to
have
a
look
at
my
old
pony
miss
torrington
nodded
her
assent
and
they
both
left
the
room
together
leaving
fanny
more
triumphant
than
mortified
he
said
that
my
persecutions
would
begin
as
soon
as
my
election
was
made
sure
oh
why
is
he
not
here
to
sustain
and
comfort
me
but
i
will
not
fall
away
in
the
hour
of
trial
the
poor
girl
turned
her
eyes
from
the
window
whence
she
saw
her
brother
and
rosalind
walking
gaily
and
happily
as
she
thought
in
search
of
the
old
pony
and
hastened
to
take
refuge
in
her
now
rendered
almost
sacred
in
her
eyes
by
the
pastoral
visit
she
had
that
morning
received
there
the
following
hour
or
two
gave
fanny
her
first
taste
of
martyrdom
she
was
or
at
least
had
been
devotedly
attached
to
her
brother
and
the
knowing
him
to
be
so
near
yet
so
distant
from
her
was
terrible
yet
was
she
not
altogether
without
consolation
she
opened
the
volume
that
volume
that
had
so
lately
interpreted
to
her
fearful
profanation
in
such
a
manner
as
best
to
suit
his
own
views
and
by
means
of
using
the
process
he
had
taught
her
though
unconsciously
perhaps
she
contrived
to
find
a
multitude
of
texts
all
proving
that
she
and
the
vicar
were
quite
right
and
all
the
countless
myriads
who
thought
differently
quite
wrong
then
followed
a
thanksgiving
which
might
have
been
fairly
expressed
in
such
words
as
i
thank
thee
i
am
not
like
other
men
and
then
as
the
sweet
summer
air
waved
the
acacias
to
and
fro
before
her
windows
and
her
young
spirit
panting
for
lawns
and
groves
sunshine
and
shade
suggested
the
idea
of
her
brother
and
rosalind
enjoying
it
all
without
her
her
poetical
vein
came
to
her
relief
and
she
sat
down
to
compose
a
hymn
in
which
after
rehearsing
prettily
enough
all
the
delights
of
summer
rambles
through
verdant
fields
for
four
stanzas
she
completed
the
composition
by
a
fifth
of
which
sin
begin
and
within
formed
the
rhymes
this
having
recourse
to
song
divine
was
a
happy
thought
for
her
inasmuch
as
it
not
only
occupied
time
which
must
otherwise
have
hung
with
overwhelming
weight
upon
her
hands
but
the
employment
soon
conjured
up
as
she
proceeded
the
image
of
cartwright
and
the
pious
smile
with
which
he
would
receive
it
from
her
hands
and
the
soft
approval
spoken
more
by
the
eyes
than
the
lips
and
the
holy
caress
such
according
to
his
authority
as
that
with
which
angel
meets
angel
in
the
courts
of
heaven
all
this
was
very
pleasant
and
consoling
to
her
feelings
and
when
her
hymn
was
finished
she
determined
to
go
down
stairs
in
order
to
sing
it
to
some
hitherto
profane
air
which
she
might
select
from
among
the
songs
of
her
sinful
youth
as
she
passed
the
mirror
she
again
glanced
at
her
disfigured
little
head
but
at
that
moment
she
was
so
strong
in
conviction
that
far
from
wishing
to
accommodate
her
new
birth
of
to
worldly
eyes
she
employed
a
minute
or
two
in
sedulously
smoothing
and
controlling
her
rebellious
tresses
and
even
held
her
head
in
stiff
equilibrium
to
prevent
their
escape
from
behind
her
ears
good
and
holy
man
she
exclaimed
aloud
as
she
gave
a
parting
glance
at
the
result
of
all
these
little
pious
coquetries
how
well
i
know
what
his
kind
words
would
be
if
he
could
see
me
now
such
she
added
with
a
gentle
sigh
will
i
strive
to
be
though
all
the
world
should
join
together
to
persecute
me
for
it
while
cartwright
prettiest
convert
was
thus
employed
miss
torrington
and
charles
mowbray
far
from
being
engaged
in
chasing
a
pony
or
even
in
looking
at
the
summer
luxury
of
bloom
which
breathed
around
them
as
they
pursued
their
way
through
the
were
very
gravely
discussing
the
symptoms
of
her
case
it
is
a
joke
rosalind
and
nothing
more
said
the
young
man
drawing
her
arm
within
his
i
really
can
do
nothing
but
laugh
at
such
folly
and
i
beg
and
entreat
that
you
will
do
the
same
then
you
think
of
course
mowbray
that
i
have
been
supremely
absurd
in
sending
you
the
summons
i
did
far
very
far
otherwise
he
replied
gravely
it
has
shown
me
a
new
feature
in
your
character
miss
torrington
and
one
which
not
to
admire
would
be
a
sin
worse
even
than
poor
cartwright
would
consider
your
wearing
these
pretty
ringlets
rosalind
mr
cartwright
repeated
rosalind
drawing
away
her
arm
how
little
do
we
think
alike
mowbray
concerning
that
man
the
chief
difference
between
us
on
the
subject
i
suspect
arises
from
your
thinking
of
him
a
great
deal
rosalind
and
my
thinking
of
him
very
little
i
should
certainly
if
i
set
about
reasoning
on
the
matter
feel
considerable
contempt
for
a
clergyman
of
the
church
of
england
who
manifested
his
care
of
the
souls
committed
to
his
charge
by
making
their
little
bodies
comb
their
hair
straight
for
the
pleasure
of
saying
that
it
was
done
upon
conviction
but
surely
there
is
more
room
for
mirth
than
sorrow
in
this
indeed
indeed
you
are
mistaken
and
that
not
only
as
regards
the
individual
interests
of
your
sister
fanny
though
heaven
knows
i
think
that
no
light
matter
but
as
a
subject
that
must
be
interesting
to
every
christian
soul
that
lives
do
not
make
a
jest
of
what
involves
by
far
the
most
important
question
that
can
be
brought
before
poor
mortals
it
is
unworthy
of
you
mr
mowbray
if
you
take
the
subject
in
its
general
character
replied
charles
i
am
sure
we
shall
differ
i
deplore
as
sincerely
as
you
can
do
miss
torrington
the
grievously
schismatic
inroad
into
our
national
church
which
these
apostles
have
made
but
as
one
objection
against
them
though
perhaps
not
the
heaviest
is
the
contempt
which
their
absurd
puritanical
ordinances
have
often
brought
upon
serious
things
i
can
not
but
think
that
ridicule
is
a
fair
weapon
to
lash
them
withal
it
may
be
so
replied
rosalind
and
in
truth
it
is
often
impossible
to
avoid
using
it
but
yet
it
does
not
follow
that
the
deeds
and
doctrines
of
these
saints
give
more
room
for
mirth
than
sorrow
well
rosalind
give
me
your
arm
again
and
i
will
speak
more
seriously
the
very
preposterous
and
ludicrous
manner
which
fanny
or
her
spiritual
adviser
has
chosen
for
showing
forth
her
own
particular
regeneration
has
perhaps
led
me
to
treat
it
more
slightly
than
i
should
have
done
had
the
indications
of
this
temporary
perversion
of
judgment
been
of
a
more
serious
character
that
is
doubtless
one
reason
for
the
mirth
i
have
shown
another
is
that
i
conceive
it
would
be
more
easy
to
draw
poor
little
fanny
back
again
into
the
bosom
of
mother
church
by
laughing
at
her
rather
than
by
making
her
believe
herself
a
martyr
your
laughter
is
a
species
of
martyrdom
which
she
will
be
taught
to
glory
in
enduring
but
at
present
i
feel
sure
that
all
our
discussions
on
this
topic
must
be
in
vain
i
rejoice
that
you
are
here
though
it
is
plain
that
you
do
not
think
her
situation
requires
your
presence
and
i
will
ask
no
further
submission
of
your
judgment
to
mine
than
requesting
that
you
will
not
leave
mowbray
till
your
mother
returns
be
assured
i
will
not
and
be
assured
also
that
however
much
it
is
possible
we
may
differ
as
to
the
actual
atrocity
of
this
new
vicar
or
the
danger
fanny
runs
in
listening
to
him
i
shall
never
cease
to
be
grateful
dearest
miss
torrington
for
the
interest
you
have
shown
for
her
and
indeed
for
us
all
acquit
me
of
silly
interference
replied
rosalind
colouring
and
i
will
acquit
you
of
all
obligation
but
i
do
wish
to
be
acquitted
of
it
said
charles
rather
tenderly
you
do
not
know
how
much
pleasure
i
have
in
thinking
that
you
already
feel
interested
about
us
all
this
was
giving
exactly
the
turn
to
what
she
had
done
which
poor
rosalind
most
deprecated
the
idea
that
young
mowbray
might
imagine
she
had
sent
for
him
from
general
feeling
of
interest
for
the
had
very
nearly
prevented
her
writing
at
all
and
nothing
but
a
sense
of
duty
had
conquered
the
repugnance
she
felt
at
doing
it
it
had
not
been
a
little
vexing
to
perceive
that
he
thought
lightly
of
what
she
considered
as
so
important
and
now
that
in
addition
to
this
he
appeared
to
conceive
it
necessary
to
return
thanks
for
the
she
had
manifested
rosalind
turned
away
her
head
and
not
without
difficulty
restrained
the
tears
which
were
gathering
in
her
eyes
from
falling
she
was
not
in
general
slow
in
finding
words
to
express
what
she
wished
to
say
but
at
this
moment
though
extremely
desirous
of
answering
as
she
would
have
herself
described
the
power
she
wanted
not
a
syllable
would
suggest
itself
which
she
had
courage
or
inclination
to
speak
so
hastening
her
steps
towards
the
house
she
murmured
you
are
very
kind
it
is
almost
time
to
dress
i
believe
and
left
him
charles
felt
that
there
was
something
wrong
between
them
and
decided
at
once
very
generously
that
it
must
be
his
fault
there
is
nothing
more
difficult
to
trace
with
a
skilful
hand
than
the
process
by
which
a
young
man
and
maiden
often
into
love
without
either
of
them
being
at
all
aware
at
what
moment
they
were
first
seized
with
the
symptoms
when
the
parties
in
love
the
thing
is
easy
enough
to
describe
it
is
a
shot
a
thunderbolt
a
whirlwind
or
a
storm
nothing
can
be
more
broadly
evident
than
their
hopes
and
their
ecstasies
their
agonies
and
their
fears
but
when
affection
grows
unconsciously
and
like
a
seed
of
minionette
thrown
at
random
unexpectedly
shows
itself
the
sweetest
and
most
valued
of
the
heart
treasures
overpowering
by
its
delicious
breath
all
other
fragrance
the
case
is
different
something
very
like
this
creeping
process
was
now
going
on
in
the
heart
of
young
mowbray
rosalind
beauty
had
appeared
to
him
veiled
by
a
very
dark
cloud
on
her
first
arrival
from
ireland
she
was
weary
heartsick
frightened
and
moreover
dressed
in
very
unbecoming
mourning
but
as
tears
gave
place
to
smiles
fears
to
hopes
and
exhausted
spirits
to
cheerfulness
he
found
out
that
she
was
very
pretty
indeed
and
then
and
then
and
then
he
could
not
tell
how
it
happened
himself
so
neither
can
i
but
certain
it
is
that
her
letter
gave
him
almost
as
much
pleasure
as
alarm
and
if
after
being
convinced
that
there
was
no
danger
of
cartwright
becoming
his
he
showed
a
somewhat
unbecoming
degree
of
levity
in
his
manner
of
treating
fanny
case
it
must
be
attributed
to
the
gay
happiness
he
felt
at
being
so
unexpectedly
called
home
as
for
the
heart
of
rosalind
if
any
thing
was
going
on
therein
at
all
out
of
the
common
way
she
certainly
was
not
aware
of
it
she
felt
vexed
anxious
out
of
spirits
as
she
sought
her
solitary
but
it
would
have
been
no
easy
task
to
persuade
her
that
love
had
any
thing
to
do
with
it
chapter
iii
charles
walks
over
to
the
vicar
improves
in
his
opinion
at
the
time
miss
torrington
observed
to
mowbray
that
it
was
near
it
wanted
about
four
hours
of
dinner
so
having
followed
her
with
his
eyes
as
she
mounted
the
steps
and
entered
the
house
he
drew
out
his
watch
and
perceiving
that
he
had
quite
enough
time
for
the
excursion
before
would
be
over
set
off
to
walk
to
oakley
how
far
rosalind
might
have
been
disposed
to
quarrel
with
him
for
the
very
small
proportion
of
meditation
which
he
bestowed
on
fanny
during
his
delightful
stroll
through
the
shady
lanes
or
how
far
she
might
have
been
tempted
to
forgive
him
for
the
much
greater
portion
devoted
to
herself
it
is
impossible
to
say
but
he
arrived
at
sir
gilbert
in
that
happy
state
of
mind
which
is
often
the
result
of
a
delicious
when
hope
lends
the
support
of
her
anchor
to
fancy
sir
gilbert
and
the
colonel
were
out
on
horseback
the
servant
said
but
my
lady
is
in
the
garden
and
thither
mowbray
went
to
seek
her
he
was
somewhat
startled
at
his
first
reception
for
the
old
lady
watched
his
approach
for
some
steps
standing
and
without
giving
the
slightest
symptom
of
recognition
at
length
she
raised
her
glass
to
her
eye
and
discovered
who
the
tall
stranger
was
upon
which
she
sent
forth
a
sound
greatly
resembling
a
view
hollo
which
immediately
recalled
the
servant
who
had
marshalled
mowbray
to
the
garden
and
without
uttering
a
word
of
welcome
gave
the
following
order
very
distinctly
let
richard
take
the
brown
mare
and
ride
her
sharp
to
ramsden
sir
gilbert
is
gone
to
the
the
bank
the
sadler
and
the
let
him
be
told
that
mowbray
is
waiting
for
him
at
oakley
and
let
not
a
single
instant
be
lost
the
rapid
manner
in
which
very
well
my
lady
was
uttered
in
reply
and
the
man
vanished
out
of
sight
showed
that
the
order
was
likely
to
be
as
promptly
executed
as
spoken
my
dear
dear
charles
cried
the
old
lady
then
stepping
forward
and
placing
her
hands
in
his
what
brings
you
back
to
mowbray
but
never
mind
what
it
is
nothing
very
bad
i
hope
and
then
i
must
rejoice
at
it
i
am
most
thankful
to
see
you
here
my
dear
boy
how
is
my
sweet
helen
could
you
not
bring
her
with
you
charles
she
is
in
london
my
dear
lady
harrington
with
my
mother
where
is
the
colonel
with
his
father
they
will
return
together
no
grass
will
grow
under
their
horses
feet
as
they
ride
homeward
to
meet
you
charles
but
how
comes
it
that
you
are
at
home
if
you
have
left
oxford
why
are
you
not
with
your
mother
and
helen
a
moment
thought
might
have
told
mowbray
that
this
question
would
certainly
be
asked
and
must
in
some
manner
or
other
be
answered
but
the
moment
thought
had
not
been
given
to
it
and
he
now
felt
considerably
embarrassed
how
to
answer
he
lamented
the
estrangement
already
existing
however
too
sincerely
to
run
any
risk
of
increasing
it
by
reserve
and
therefore
after
a
moment
hesitation
very
frankly
answered
i
can
tell
you
my
dear
lady
why
i
am
here
more
easily
than
i
can
explain
for
what
purpose
i
returned
post
to
mowbray
this
morning
because
miss
torrington
gave
me
a
private
intimation
by
letter
that
she
thought
the
new
vicar
of
wrexhill
was
obtaining
an
undue
influence
over
the
mind
of
fanny
she
did
not
express
herself
very
clearly
and
i
was
fool
enough
to
imagine
that
she
supposed
he
was
making
love
to
her
but
i
find
that
her
fears
are
only
for
poor
little
fanny
orthodoxy
cartwright
is
one
of
i
believe
the
most
mischievous
sect
that
ever
attacked
the
established
church
and
miss
torrington
not
without
good
reason
fears
that
fanny
is
in
danger
of
becoming
a
proselyte
to
his
gloomy
and
unchristianlike
doctrine
but
at
her
age
such
a
whim
as
this
is
not
i
should
hope
very
likely
to
be
lasting
i
do
know
that
replied
lady
harrington
sharply
miss
torrington
has
acted
with
great
propriety
and
exactly
with
the
sort
of
promptitude
and
decision
of
character
for
which
i
should
have
given
her
credit
beware
mowbray
how
you
make
light
of
the
appearance
of
religious
schism
among
you
it
is
a
deadly
weapon
of
discord
and
the
poison
in
which
it
is
dipped
seldom
finds
an
antidote
either
in
family
affection
or
filial
obedience
but
fanny
is
so
nearly
a
child
lady
harrington
that
i
can
hardly
believe
her
capable
of
manifesting
any
very
dangerous
religious
zeal
at
present
you
do
know
what
you
are
talking
about
charles
of
every
family
into
which
this
insidious
and
most
schism
has
crept
you
would
find
upon
inquiry
that
in
nine
instances
out
of
ten
it
has
been
the
young
girls
who
have
been
selected
as
the
first
objects
of
conversion
and
then
made
the
active
means
of
spreading
it
afterwards
do
treat
this
matter
lightly
my
dear
boy
personally
i
know
nothing
of
this
cartwright
we
never
leave
our
parish
church
and
our
excellent
broughton
to
run
after
brawling
extempore
preachers
but
i
have
been
told
by
one
or
two
of
our
neighbours
who
do
that
he
is
what
is
called
a
which
means
being
interpreted
a
ranting
canting
fanatic
take
care
above
all
things
that
your
mother
does
not
catch
the
infection
my
mother
oh
no
her
steady
principles
and
quiet
good
sense
would
render
such
a
falling
off
as
that
quite
impossible
very
well
i
am
willing
to
hope
so
and
yet
charles
i
can
not
for
the
life
of
me
help
thinking
that
she
must
have
had
some
other
adviser
than
her
own
heart
when
she
left
my
good
sir
gilbert
letter
without
an
answer
of
what
letter
do
you
speak
lady
harrington
said
young
mowbray
colouring
of
that
whereby
he
refused
to
execute
the
trust
my
father
bequeathed
him
no
charles
of
that
whereby
he
rescinded
his
refusal
has
such
a
letter
been
sent
inquired
mowbray
eagerly
i
never
heard
of
it
indeed
then
we
must
presume
that
mowbray
did
not
think
it
worth
mentioning
such
a
letter
has
however
been
sent
mowbray
and
i
confess
i
hoped
on
seeing
you
arrive
that
you
were
come
to
give
it
an
amicable
though
somewhat
tardy
answer
in
person
i
am
greatly
surprised
replied
charles
to
hear
that
such
a
letter
has
been
received
by
my
mother
because
i
had
been
led
to
believe
that
sir
gilbert
had
declared
himself
immoveable
on
the
subject
but
still
more
am
i
surprised
that
i
should
not
have
heard
of
it
could
helen
know
it
and
not
tell
me
it
must
have
been
to
her
a
source
of
the
greatest
happiness
as
the
one
which
preceded
had
been
of
the
deepest
mortification
and
sorrow
your
sister
then
saw
the
first
letter
she
did
lady
harrington
and
wrote
me
word
of
it
with
expressions
of
the
most
sincere
regret
but
of
the
second
she
said
nothing
that
is
not
like
helen
so
little
is
it
like
her
that
i
feel
confident
she
never
heard
of
the
second
letter
i
believe
so
too
charles
but
what
then
are
we
to
think
of
your
mother
having
shown
the
first
letter
and
concealed
the
second
it
can
not
be
my
mother
never
conceals
any
thing
from
us
we
have
never
from
the
moment
we
left
the
nursery
been
kept
in
ignorance
of
any
circumstance
of
general
interest
to
the
family
my
poor
constant
phrase
upon
all
such
occasions
was
it
be
discussed
in
a
committee
of
the
whole
house
i
can
not
understand
it
replied
the
old
lady
seating
herself
upon
a
bench
in
the
shade
but
at
any
rate
i
rejoice
that
you
did
not
all
think
sir
gilbert
recantation
which
was
not
written
without
an
effort
i
promise
you
so
totally
unworthy
of
notice
as
you
have
appeared
to
do
charles
mowbray
seated
himself
beside
her
and
nearly
an
hour
was
passed
in
conversation
on
the
same
subject
or
others
connected
with
it
at
the
end
of
that
time
sir
gilbert
booted
and
spurred
appeared
at
the
door
of
the
mansion
followed
by
his
son
there
was
an
angry
spot
upon
his
cheek
and
though
it
was
sufficiently
evident
that
he
was
eager
to
meet
young
mowbray
it
was
equally
so
that
he
was
displeased
with
him
lady
harrington
however
soon
cleared
the
way
to
the
most
frank
and
cordial
communication
rendering
all
explanation
unnecessary
by
exclaiming
he
has
never
seen
nor
heard
of
your
second
letter
sir
gilbert
nor
helen
either
the
baronet
stood
still
for
a
moment
looking
with
doubt
and
surprise
first
at
his
wife
and
then
at
his
guest
the
doubt
however
vanished
in
a
moment
and
he
again
advanced
and
now
with
an
extended
hand
towards
charles
a
conversation
of
some
length
ensued
but
as
it
consisted
wholly
of
conjectures
upon
a
point
that
they
were
all
equally
unable
to
explain
it
is
unnecessary
to
repeat
it
the
two
young
men
met
each
other
with
expressions
of
the
most
cordial
regard
and
before
they
parted
colonel
harrington
related
the
conversation
he
had
held
with
helen
and
miss
torrington
the
result
of
which
was
his
father
having
despatched
the
letter
whose
fate
appeared
involved
in
so
much
mystery
lady
harrington
notwithstanding
they
who
did
not
love
her
called
her
masculine
showed
some
feminine
tact
in
not
mentioning
to
sir
gilbert
that
it
was
a
letter
from
miss
torrington
which
had
recalled
charles
it
is
probable
that
when
her
own
questionings
had
forced
this
avowal
from
him
she
had
perceived
some
shade
of
embarrassment
in
his
answer
but
she
failed
not
to
mention
the
turn
that
fanny
mowbray
appeared
to
have
taken
and
her
suspicions
that
the
new
vicar
of
wrexhill
must
have
been
rather
more
assiduous
than
was
desirable
in
his
visit
at
the
park
the
case
is
clear
clear
as
daylight
my
lady
i
understand
it
all
stop
a
moment
charles
if
you
wo
stay
dinner
you
must
stay
while
i
furnish
you
with
a
document
by
means
of
which
you
may
i
think
make
a
useful
experiment
without
waiting
for
an
answer
sir
gilbert
left
the
party
in
the
garden
and
hurried
into
the
house
whence
he
returned
in
a
few
minutes
with
a
scrap
of
paper
in
his
hand
fortunately
charles
very
fortunately
i
have
kept
a
copy
of
my
last
note
to
your
mother
i
am
sure
i
know
not
what
induced
me
to
keep
it
had
such
a
thing
happened
to
cartwright
he
would
have
declared
it
providential
but
i
in
my
modesty
only
call
it
take
this
paper
charles
and
read
it
if
you
will
is
a
shame
you
have
not
read
it
before
you
say
i
think
that
the
vicar
is
expected
at
mowbray
this
evening
just
put
this
scrap
of
paper
into
his
hand
and
ask
him
if
he
ever
read
it
before
let
him
say
what
he
will
i
give
you
credit
for
sufficient
sharpness
to
find
out
the
truth
if
he
has
seen
it
i
shall
know
whom
i
have
to
thank
for
the
insolent
contempt
it
has
met
with
but
my
mother
cried
charles
with
emotion
is
it
possible
that
she
could
conceal
such
a
note
as
this
from
her
children
and
show
it
to
this
man
sir
gilbert
i
can
not
believe
it
i
do
like
to
believe
it
myself
charles
upon
my
life
i
do
but
what
can
we
think
at
any
rate
make
the
experiment
it
can
do
no
harm
and
come
here
to
dinner
to
tell
us
the
result
i
will
come
to
you
with
the
greatest
pleasure
and
bring
you
all
the
intelligence
i
can
get
my
own
opinion
is
that
the
note
was
lost
before
it
reached
my
mother
hands
the
usual
hour
i
suppose
sir
gilbert
six
six
charles
and
as
usual
punctual
to
a
moment
when
mowbray
reached
his
home
it
was
in
truth
rather
more
than
time
to
dress
but
he
kept
the
young
ladies
waiting
as
short
a
time
as
possible
fanny
presented
him
in
proper
style
to
miss
cartwright
as
soon
as
he
appeared
in
the
and
he
had
the
honour
of
giving
that
silent
young
lady
his
arm
to
the
charles
thought
her
black
eyes
very
handsome
nevertheless
he
secretly
wished
that
she
were
a
hundred
miles
off
for
her
presence
of
course
checked
every
approach
to
confidential
conversation
nothing
indeed
could
well
be
more
dull
and
unprofitable
than
this
dinner
miss
cartwright
spoke
not
at
all
fanny
no
more
than
was
necessary
for
the
performance
of
her
duty
at
the
head
of
the
table
and
rosalind
looked
pale
and
languid
and
so
completely
out
of
spirits
that
every
word
she
spoke
seemed
a
painful
effort
to
her
she
was
occupied
in
recalling
to
mind
the
tone
and
air
of
the
party
who
dined
together
in
that
same
room
about
six
months
before
when
charles
had
last
returned
from
oxford
the
contrast
these
recollections
offered
to
the
aspect
of
the
present
party
was
most
painful
and
as
rosalind
turned
her
eyes
round
the
table
with
a
look
of
wistful
melancholy
as
if
looking
for
those
who
were
no
longer
there
her
thoughts
were
so
legibly
written
on
her
countenance
that
mowbray
understood
them
as
plainly
as
if
they
had
been
spoken
rosalind
will
you
take
wine
with
me
you
look
tired
and
pale
this
was
said
in
a
tone
of
affectionate
interest
that
seemed
to
excite
the
attention
of
henrietta
and
when
miss
torrington
raised
her
eyes
to
answer
it
she
observed
that
young
lady
looks
fixed
on
countenance
with
an
expression
that
denoted
curiosity
the
whole
party
seemed
glad
to
escape
from
the
and
the
young
ladies
with
light
shawls
and
parasols
had
just
wandered
out
upon
the
lawn
when
they
met
cartwright
approaching
the
house
fanny
coloured
and
looked
at
her
brother
miss
cartwright
coloured
too
and
her
eyes
followed
the
direction
of
fanny
as
if
to
see
how
this
familiar
mode
of
approach
was
approved
by
mowbray
charles
certainly
felt
a
little
surprised
and
did
not
take
much
pains
to
conceal
it
for
a
moment
he
looked
at
the
vicar
as
if
not
quite
certain
who
it
was
and
then
touching
his
hat
with
ceremonious
politeness
said
haughtily
enough
cartwright
i
believe
it
would
have
been
difficult
for
any
one
to
find
fault
with
the
manner
in
which
this
salutation
was
returned
in
a
tone
admirably
modulated
between
profound
respect
and
friendly
kindness
his
hat
raised
gracefully
from
his
head
to
greet
the
whole
party
and
his
handsome
features
wearing
an
expression
of
the
gentlest
benevolence
cartwright
hoped
that
he
had
the
happiness
of
seeing
mowbray
well
charles
felt
more
than
half
ashamed
of
the
reception
he
had
given
him
and
stretched
out
his
hand
as
if
to
atone
for
it
the
vicar
felt
his
advantage
and
pursued
it
by
the
most
easy
winning
yet
respectful
style
of
conversation
his
language
and
manners
became
completely
those
of
an
accomplished
man
of
the
world
his
topics
were
drawn
from
the
day
paper
and
the
last
review
he
ventured
a
jest
upon
don
carlos
and
a
upon
the
duke
of
wellington
took
little
or
no
notice
of
fanny
spoke
affectionately
to
his
daughter
and
gaily
to
miss
torrington
and
in
short
appeared
to
be
as
little
deserving
of
all
rosalind
had
said
of
him
as
it
was
well
possible
for
a
gentleman
to
be
fair
rosalind
has
certainly
suffered
her
imagination
to
conjure
up
a
bugbear
in
this
man
thought
charles
it
is
impossible
he
can
be
the
violent
fanatic
she
describes
after
wandering
about
the
gardens
for
some
time
fanny
proposed
that
they
should
go
in
to
tea
but
before
they
reached
the
house
cartwright
proposed
to
take
his
leave
saying
that
he
had
an
engagement
in
wrexhill
which
was
to
prevent
his
lengthening
his
visit
the
adieu
had
been
spoken
on
all
sides
and
the
vicar
turned
from
them
to
depart
when
charles
recollected
the
commission
he
had
received
from
sir
gilbert
and
that
he
had
promised
to
report
the
result
on
the
morrow
hastily
following
him
therefore
he
said
i
beg
your
pardon
cartwright
hut
before
you
go
will
you
have
the
kindness
to
read
this
note
and
tell
me
if
you
know
whether
my
mother
received
such
a
one
before
she
went
to
london
cartwright
took
the
note
read
it
attentively
and
then
returned
it
saying
no
mowbray
i
should
certainly
think
not
not
because
i
never
saw
or
heard
of
it
but
because
i
imagine
that
if
she
had
she
would
not
have
proceeded
to
london
without
sir
gilbert
was
such
a
note
as
that
sent
mr
mowbray
charles
had
kept
his
eye
very
steadily
fixed
on
the
vicar
both
while
he
read
the
note
and
while
he
spoke
of
it
not
the
slightest
indication
however
of
his
knowing
any
thing
about
it
was
visible
in
his
countenance
voice
or
manner
and
again
as
he
looked
at
him
young
mowbray
felt
ashamed
of
suspicions
for
which
there
seemed
to
be
so
little
cause
such
a
note
as
this
was
sent
cartwright
he
frankly
replied
but
i
suspect
that
by
some
unlucky
accident
it
never
reached
my
hands
otherwise
as
you
well
observe
she
would
not
most
assuredly
have
set
off
to
london
on
this
business
without
communicating
with
sir
gilbert
harrington
i
conceive
it
must
be
so
indeed
mowbray
and
it
is
greatly
to
be
lamented
for
the
receiving
it
would
have
saved
poor
mowbray
much
anxiety
and
trouble
she
expressed
herself
to
you
as
being
annoyed
by
sir
gilbert
refusing
to
act
oh
yes
repeatedly
so
much
so
indeed
that
nothing
but
the
indispensable
duty
of
my
parish
prevented
my
offering
to
accompany
her
to
london
myself
i
wished
her
very
much
to
send
for
you
but
nothing
would
induce
her
to
interrupt
your
studies
it
is
not
in
the
nature
of
a
young
man
to
doubt
statements
thus
simply
uttered
by
one
having
the
bearing
and
appearance
of
a
gentleman
and
charles
mowbray
reported
accordingly
at
the
of
sir
gilbert
assuring
him
that
the
had
proved
innocence
on
this
point
most
satisfactorily
chapter
iv
stephen
corbold
we
must
now
follow
mowbray
and
helen
to
london
as
some
of
the
circumstances
which
occurred
there
proved
of
importance
to
them
afterwards
the
journey
was
a
very
melancholy
one
to
helen
and
her
feelings
as
unlike
as
possible
to
those
which
usually
accompany
a
young
lady
of
her
age
appearance
and
station
upon
a
visit
to
the
metropolis
mowbray
spoke
very
little
being
greatly
occupied
by
the
volume
recommended
to
her
notice
at
parting
by
cartwright
and
more
than
once
helen
felt
something
like
envy
at
the
situation
of
the
two
servants
who
perched
aloft
behind
the
carriage
were
enjoying
without
restraint
the
rapid
movement
the
fresh
air
and
the
beautiful
country
through
which
they
passed
while
she
like
a
drooping
flower
on
which
the
sun
has
ceased
to
shine
hung
her
fair
hand
and
languished
for
the
kindly
warmth
she
had
lost
they
reached
wimpole
street
about
eight
in
the
evening
and
found
every
thing
prepared
for
them
with
the
most
sedulous
attention
in
their
handsome
and
commodious
apartments
mowbray
was
tired
and
being
really
in
need
of
the
refreshment
blessed
the
hand
or
rather
the
thought
which
had
forestalled
all
her
wants
and
wishes
and
spread
that
dearest
of
travelling
banquets
tea
and
coffee
ready
to
greet
her
as
she
entered
the
this
letter
has
been
left
for
you
by
the
gentleman
who
took
the
apartment
said
the
landlady
taking
a
packet
from
the
and
he
desired
it
might
be
given
to
you
immediately
mowbray
opened
it
but
perceiving
it
enclosed
another
the
address
of
which
she
glanced
her
eye
upon
she
folded
it
up
again
and
begged
to
be
shown
to
her
room
while
the
tea
was
made
her
maid
followed
her
but
was
dismissed
with
orders
to
see
if
miss
mowbray
wanted
any
thing
as
soon
as
she
was
alone
she
prepared
to
examine
the
packet
the
receipt
of
which
certainly
startled
her
for
it
was
in
the
handwriting
of
cartwright
from
whom
she
had
parted
but
a
few
hours
before
the
envelope
contained
only
these
words
stephen
corbold
presents
his
respectful
compliments
to
mowbray
and
will
do
himself
the
honour
of
waiting
upon
her
morning
at
eleven
gray
inn
july
mowbray
ran
her
eyes
very
rapidly
over
these
words
and
then
opened
the
enclosed
letter
it
was
as
follows
do
not
let
the
unexpected
sight
of
a
letter
from
your
minister
alarm
you
my
dear
and
friend
i
have
nothing
painful
to
disclose
and
my
sole
object
in
writing
is
to
make
you
feel
that
though
you
are
distant
from
the
sheltered
spot
wherein
the
lord
hath
caused
you
to
dwell
the
shepherd
eye
which
hath
been
appointed
to
watch
over
you
is
not
withdrawn
i
am
no
longer
a
young
man
my
dear
mowbray
and
during
the
years
through
which
i
have
passed
my
profession
my
duty
and
my
inclination
have
alike
led
me
to
examine
my
and
to
read
them
as
it
were
athwart
the
veil
of
their
mortal
bodies
habit
and
application
have
given
me
i
believe
some
skill
in
developing
the
inward
character
of
those
amongst
whom
i
am
thrown
nor
can
i
doubt
that
the
hand
of
heaven
is
in
this
as
in
truth
it
is
in
all
things
if
we
do
but
diligently
set
ourselves
to
trace
it
i
can
not
i
say
but
believe
that
this
faculty
which
i
feel
so
strong
within
me
of
discerning
in
whom
those
spirits
abide
that
the
lord
hath
chosen
for
his
own
i
can
not
but
believe
that
this
faculty
is
given
me
by
his
especial
will
and
for
his
especial
glory
i
wish
well
sincerely
well
to
the
whole
human
race
i
would
never
lose
an
opportunity
of
lifting
my
voice
in
warning
to
them
in
the
hope
that
peradventure
there
may
be
one
among
the
crowd
who
may
turn
and
follow
me
but
my
friend
far
different
is
the
feeling
with
which
my
heart
clings
with
stedfast
care
and
love
to
those
on
whom
i
see
the
anointing
finger
of
heaven
it
is
such
that
i
would
lead
even
as
a
pilot
leadeth
the
vessel
intrusted
to
his
skill
into
the
peaceful
waters
where
glory
and
honour
and
joy
unspeakable
and
without
end
shall
abide
with
them
for
ever
repine
not
oh
my
friend
if
all
your
race
are
not
of
these
rather
rejoice
with
exceeding
great
joy
that
it
hath
pleased
heaven
to
set
its
seal
on
two
to
this
effect
look
round
the
world
my
gentle
friend
and
see
what
myriads
of
roofs
arise
beneath
which
not
one
can
be
found
to
show
forth
the
saving
power
mark
them
how
they
thread
the
giddy
maze
and
dance
onward
down
the
slippery
path
that
leads
to
everlasting
perdition
mark
this
sweet
spirit
and
rejoice
that
you
and
your
fanny
are
snatched
from
the
burning
my
soul
revels
in
an
ecstasy
of
rapture
unspeakable
as
i
gaze
upon
you
both
and
know
that
it
is
i
even
i
am
chosen
to
lead
you
what
are
all
the
victories
and
glories
of
the
world
to
this
think
you
my
gentle
friend
that
if
all
the
worldly
state
and
station
of
lambeth
were
offered
me
on
one
side
and
the
task
of
leading
thy
meek
steps
into
the
way
of
life
called
me
to
the
other
that
i
should
hesitate
for
one
single
instant
which
to
choose
oh
no
trust
me
i
would
meet
the
scorn
and
revilings
of
all
men
aye
and
the
bitterest
persecutions
that
ever
the
saints
of
old
were
called
upon
to
bear
rather
than
turn
mine
eyes
from
thee
and
the
dear
work
though
princedoms
principalities
and
powers
might
be
gained
thereby
be
strong
then
in
faith
be
strong
in
hope
for
thou
art
well
loved
of
heaven
and
of
him
whom
it
hath
been
its
will
to
place
near
thee
as
its
minister
on
earth
be
strong
in
faith
kneel
down
sweet
friend
even
now
as
thine
eye
reads
these
characters
traced
by
the
hand
of
one
who
would
give
his
life
to
guard
thee
from
harm
kneel
down
and
ask
that
heaven
may
be
with
thee
well
assured
that
he
who
bids
thee
to
do
so
will
at
the
same
moment
be
kneeling
likewise
to
invoke
blessings
on
thy
fair
and
virtuous
head
at
a
moment
when
the
heart
is
drawn
heavenward
as
mine
is
now
how
hateful
i
may
say
how
profane
seem
those
worldly
appellations
and
distinctions
with
which
the
silly
vanity
of
man
has
sought
to
decorate
our
individual
nothingness
how
much
more
befitting
a
serious
christian
is
it
in
such
a
moment
as
this
to
use
that
name
which
was
bestowed
by
a
higher
authority
you
have
three
such
my
sweet
friend
the
two
first
are
now
appropriated
as
it
were
to
your
daughters
but
the
third
is
more
especially
your
clara
on
clara
may
the
dew
of
heaven
descend
like
healing
balm
kneel
then
sweet
clara
thou
chosen
handmaid
kneel
down
and
think
that
william
cartwright
kneels
beside
thee
written
on
my
knees
in
the
secret
recesses
of
my
own
chamber
no
sooner
did
mowbray
eye
reach
the
words
kneel
down
than
she
obeyed
them
and
in
this
attitude
read
to
the
end
of
the
epistle
mowbray
feelings
whenever
strongly
excited
either
by
joy
sorrow
or
any
other
emotion
always
showed
themselves
in
tears
and
she
now
wept
profusely
vehemently
though
it
is
probable
she
would
have
been
greatly
puzzled
to
explain
why
even
to
herself
she
would
certainly
however
have
declared
had
she
spoken
on
the
subject
to
any
one
that
those
tears
were
a
joy
a
blessing
and
a
comfort
to
her
but
as
she
had
nobody
to
whom
she
could
thus
open
her
heart
she
washed
her
eyes
with
cold
water
and
descended
with
all
the
composure
she
could
assume
to
helen
and
the
notwithstanding
this
precaution
helen
watchful
eye
perceived
that
her
mother
had
been
weeping
and
forgetting
the
unnatural
coldness
which
a
breath
more
fatal
than
pestilence
had
placed
between
them
she
exclaimed
with
all
her
wonted
tenderness
what
is
the
matter
dear
mamma
i
trust
that
no
bad
news
has
met
you
if
all
other
circumstances
left
it
a
matter
of
doubt
whether
evangelical
influence
as
it
is
impiously
called
were
productive
of
good
or
evil
the
terrible
power
which
it
is
so
constantly
seen
to
have
of
destroying
family
union
must
be
quite
sufficient
to
settle
the
question
any
person
who
will
take
the
trouble
to
inquire
into
the
fact
will
find
that
family
affection
has
been
more
blighted
and
destroyed
by
the
workings
of
this
fearful
superstition
than
by
any
other
cause
of
which
the
history
of
man
bears
record
the
tone
of
helen
voice
seemed
for
a
moment
to
recall
former
feelings
and
her
mother
looked
at
her
kindly
but
before
she
could
give
utterance
to
any
word
of
affection
the
recollection
of
all
cartwright
had
said
to
prove
that
helen
deserved
not
the
affection
of
her
mother
and
that
the
only
chance
left
to
save
herself
was
to
be
found
in
the
most
austere
estrangement
till
such
time
as
her
hard
heart
should
be
softened
the
recollection
of
all
this
came
across
the
terrified
mind
of
mowbray
and
she
resumed
the
solemn
and
distant
bearing
she
had
of
late
resumed
with
a
nervous
sensation
of
alarm
at
the
great
crime
she
had
been
on
the
point
of
committing
poor
helen
saw
the
look
and
listened
with
her
whole
soul
in
her
eyes
for
the
kind
words
which
had
so
nearly
followed
it
but
when
they
came
not
her
heart
sank
within
her
and
pleading
fatigue
she
begged
to
be
shown
to
her
own
room
where
she
spent
half
the
night
in
weeping
most
punctually
at
eleven
on
the
following
morning
stephen
corbold
was
announced
and
a
stiff
figure
entered
the
who
though
in
truth
a
special
attorney
looked
much
more
like
a
methodistical
preacher
than
his
friend
and
cousin
cartwright
in
age
he
was
a
few
years
that
junior
but
in
all
outward
gifts
most
lamentably
his
inferior
being
in
truth
as
and
ungentlemanlike
a
person
as
any
congregation
attached
to
the
frybabe
principles
could
furnish
the
footman
might
have
announced
him
in
the
same
words
as
lépine
did
vadius
madame
un
homme
est
là
qui
veut
parler
à
vous
il
est
vètu
de
noir
et
parle
ton
doux
for
excepting
his
little
tight
cravat
he
appeared
to
have
nothing
white
about
him
and
he
seldom
raised
his
cautious
voice
above
a
whisper
i
am
here
madam
he
began
addressing
himself
to
mowbray
who
felt
rather
at
a
loss
what
to
say
to
him
at
the
request
of
my
cousin
the
reverend
william
jacob
cartwright
vicar
of
wrexhill
he
hath
given
me
to
understand
that
you
have
business
to
transact
at
doctors
commons
relative
to
the
last
will
and
testament
of
your
late
husband
am
i
correct
madam
quite
so
corbold
i
wish
to
despatch
this
business
as
quickly
as
possible
as
i
am
anxious
to
return
again
to
my
family
no
delay
shall
intervene
that
i
can
prevent
replied
the
attorney
is
there
any
other
business
madam
in
which
my
services
can
be
available
you
are
very
kind
sir
i
believe
there
are
several
things
on
which
i
shall
have
to
trouble
you
mowbray
generally
transacted
his
own
business
which
in
london
consisted
i
believe
solely
in
receiving
dividends
and
paying
tradesmen
bills
the
only
lawyer
he
employed
therefore
was
a
gentleman
who
resides
in
our
county
and
who
has
hitherto
had
the
care
of
the
estates
but
my
excellent
minister
and
friend
cartwright
has
written
upon
this
sheet
of
paper
i
believe
what
it
will
be
necessary
for
me
to
do
in
order
to
arrange
things
for
the
future
mowbray
put
the
paper
into
the
lawyer
hands
who
read
it
over
with
great
attention
nodding
his
head
slightly
from
time
to
time
as
any
item
struck
him
as
particularly
interesting
and
important
three
per
cents
very
good
bank
stock
very
good
power
of
all
right
madam
all
right
it
hath
pleased
the
lord
to
give
my
cousin
his
servant
a
clear
and
comprehending
intellect
all
shall
be
done
even
as
it
is
here
set
down
how
long
sir
do
you
think
it
will
be
necessary
for
me
to
remain
in
town
why
madam
there
are
many
men
would
run
this
business
out
to
great
length
here
is
indeed
sufficient
to
occupy
a
very
active
professional
man
many
weeks
but
by
the
blessing
of
heaven
which
is
often
providentially
granted
to
me
in
time
of
need
i
question
not
but
i
may
be
able
to
release
you
in
a
few
days
madam
provided
always
that
you
are
prepared
to
meet
such
expenses
as
are
indispensable
upon
all
occasions
when
great
haste
is
required
expense
will
be
no
object
with
me
corbold
but
a
prolonged
absence
from
home
would
be
extremely
inconvenient
pray
remember
that
i
shall
be
most
happy
to
pay
any
additional
sum
which
hastening
through
the
business
may
require
very
good
madam
very
good
that
heaven
will
be
good
unto
me
in
this
business
i
can
not
presume
to
doubt
for
it
hath
been
consigned
unto
me
by
one
of
its
saints
on
earth
and
it
is
for
the
service
of
a
lady
who
i
am
assured
by
him
is
likely
to
become
one
of
the
most
favoured
agents
that
it
hath
ever
selected
to
do
its
work
on
earth
mowbray
coloured
from
a
mixed
feeling
of
modesty
and
pleasure
that
cartwright
should
have
thus
described
her
was
most
soothing
to
her
heart
but
when
she
recollected
how
far
advanced
he
was
and
how
very
near
the
threshold
she
as
yet
stood
her
diffidence
made
her
shrink
from
hearing
herself
named
in
language
so
flattering
is
that
fair
young
person
who
left
the
room
soon
after
i
entered
it
your
daughter
madam
yes
sir
very
good
i
rejoice
to
hear
it
that
is
i
would
be
understood
to
say
that
i
rejoice
with
an
exceeding
great
joy
that
the
child
of
a
lady
who
stands
in
such
estimation
as
you
do
with
a
chosen
minister
of
the
elected
church
should
wear
an
aspect
so
suitable
to
one
who
by
especial
providence
will
be
led
to
follow
her
example
mowbray
sighed
i
lament
madam
resumed
corbold
i
may
say
with
great
and
bitter
lamentation
both
for
your
sake
and
that
of
the
young
person
who
has
left
the
room
that
the
london
season
should
be
so
completely
over
sir
said
mowbray
in
an
accent
of
almost
indignant
surprise
is
it
possible
that
any
friend
and
relation
of
cartwright
can
imagine
that
i
in
my
unhappy
situation
or
indeed
without
that
as
a
christian
woman
hoping
with
fear
and
trembling
to
become
one
of
those
set
apart
from
worldly
things
is
it
possible
sir
that
you
can
think
i
should
partake
or
let
my
daughter
partake
in
the
corrupt
sinfulness
and
profane
rioting
of
a
london
season
may
heaven
forgive
you
for
so
unjust
a
suspicion
most
respected
madam
cried
corbold
clasping
his
hands
and
raising
his
eyes
to
heaven
the
language
of
the
saints
on
earth
is
yet
new
to
you
most
excellent
and
highly
to
be
respected
convert
of
my
cousin
the
london
season
of
which
i
speak
and
which
you
will
hear
alluded
to
by
such
sinful
creatures
as
like
me
have
reason
to
believe
by
an
especial
manifestation
of
grace
that
they
are
set
apart
the
london
season
of
which
i
and
they
speak
is
that
when
during
about
six
blessed
weeks
in
the
spring
the
chosen
vessels
resort
in
countless
numbers
to
london
for
the
purpose
of
being
present
at
all
the
meetings
which
take
place
during
that
time
with
as
much
ardour
and
holy
zeal
as
the
show
in
arranging
their
fêtes
and
their
fooleries
at
the
instigation
of
satan
in
anticipation
as
it
should
seem
poor
deluded
creatures
of
the
crowds
that
they
shall
hereafter
meet
amidst
fire
and
brimstone
in
his
realms
below
the
season
of
which
i
speak
and
of
which
you
will
hear
all
the
elect
speak
with
rapture
and
thanksgiving
consists
of
a
quick
succession
of
splendid
and
meetings
at
which
all
the
saints
on
whom
the
gift
of
speech
hath
descended
some
for
one
some
for
two
some
for
three
some
for
four
ay
some
for
five
hours
at
a
time
sustained
as
you
may
suppose
by
a
visible
resting
of
the
divine
power
upon
them
this
madam
is
the
season
that
for
your
sake
and
for
the
sake
of
the
fair
young
person
your
daughter
i
wished
was
not
yet
over
mowbray
made
a
very
penitent
and
full
apology
for
the
blunder
she
had
committed
and
very
meekly
confessed
her
ignorance
declaring
that
she
had
never
before
heard
the
epithet
of
london
season
given
to
any
thing
so
and
sublime
as
the
meetings
he
described
the
discovery
of
this
species
of
ignorance
on
the
part
of
mowbray
which
was
by
no
means
confined
to
the
instance
above
mentioned
was
a
very
favourable
circumstance
for
corbold
there
was
perhaps
no
other
subject
in
the
world
upon
which
he
was
competent
to
give
information
except
in
the
technicalities
of
his
own
profession
but
in
every
thing
relating
to
missionary
meetings
reports
child
missionary
branch
committees
london
lord
societies
and
the
like
he
was
quite
perfect
all
this
gave
him
a
value
in
mowbray
eyes
as
a
companion
which
he
might
have
wanted
without
it
at
all
conversations
of
this
kind
mowbray
took
great
care
that
helen
should
be
present
persuaded
that
nothing
could
be
so
likely
to
give
her
that
savour
of
righteousness
in
which
as
yet
she
was
so
greatly
deficient
the
consequence
of
this
arrangement
was
twofold
on
helen
side
it
generated
a
feeling
compounded
of
contempt
and
loathing
towards
the
fanatical
attorney
which
in
most
others
would
have
led
to
the
passion
called
hatred
but
in
her
it
seemed
rather
a
passive
than
an
active
sentiment
which
would
never
have
sought
either
nourishment
or
relief
in
doing
injury
to
its
object
but
which
rendered
her
so
ill
at
ease
in
his
presence
that
her
life
became
perfectly
wretched
from
the
frequency
of
it
on
the
part
of
the
gentleman
the
effect
of
these
frequent
interviews
was
different
from
thinking
mowbray
daughter
a
very
fair
young
person
he
grew
by
gradual
but
pretty
rapid
degrees
to
perceive
that
she
was
the
very
loveliest
tabernacle
in
which
had
ever
been
enshrined
the
spirit
of
a
woman
and
by
the
time
mowbray
had
learned
by
rote
the
names
titles
connexions
separations
unions
deputations
and
endowments
of
all
the
missionary
societies
root
and
branch
and
of
all
the
central
and
eccentric
establishments
for
the
instruction
of
ignorance
in
infants
of
four
months
to
adults
of
fourscore
stephen
corbold
had
made
up
his
mind
to
believe
that
by
fair
means
or
foul
it
was
his
bounden
duty
as
a
pious
man
and
serious
christian
to
appropriate
the
fair
helen
to
himself
in
this
life
and
thereby
ensure
her
everlasting
happiness
in
the
life
to
come
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
while
these
things
passed
in
london
the
vicar
of
wrexhill
was
forgotten
mowbray
heart
and
conscience
both
told
her
that
such
a
letter
as
she
had
received
from
him
must
not
remain
unanswered
she
therefore
placed
helen
in
the
with
a
small
but
very
volume
on
free
grace
recommended
by
corbold
and
having
desired
her
in
the
voice
of
command
to
study
it
attentively
till
she
retired
to
her
own
room
where
having
knelt
wept
prayed
written
and
erased
for
about
three
hours
she
finally
signed
and
sealed
an
epistle
of
which
it
is
unnecessary
to
say
more
than
that
it
conveyed
a
very
animated
feeling
of
satisfaction
to
the
heart
of
the
holy
man
to
whom
it
was
addressed
chapter
stephen
corbold
returns
with
mowbray
and

to
wrexhill
mowbray
business
in
london
simple
and
straightforward
as
it
was
might
probably
under
existing
circumstances
have
occupied
many
weeks
had
not
a
lucky
thought
which
visited
the
restless
couch
of
stephen
corbold
been
the
means
of
bringing
it
to
a
speedy
conclusion
amant
et
vous
serez
is
a
pithy
proverb
and
has
held
good
in
many
an
illustrious
instance
but
in
none
perhaps
more
conspicuously
than
in
that
of
stephen
corbold
passion
for
miss
mowbray
one
of
the
earliest
proofs
he
gave
of
this
was
the
persuading
mowbray
that
the
only
way
in
which
he
could
consistently
with
his
other
engagements
devote
to
her
as
much
time
as
her
affairs
required
would
be
by
passing
every
evening
with
her
and
he
did
pass
every
evening
with
her
and
poor
helen
was
given
to
understand
in
good
set
terms
that
if
she
presumed
to
retire
before
that
excellent
man
stephen
corbold
had
finished
his
last
tumbler
of
and
madeira
not
only
would
she
incur
her
mother
serious
displeasure
but
be
confided
during
their
absence
from
mowbray
to
the
spiritual
instruction
of
some
minister
who
would
teach
her
in
what
the
duty
of
a
daughter
consisted
and
so
helen
mowbray
sat
till
twelve
every
night
listening
to
the
works
of
the
saints
of
the
nineteenth
century
and
exposed
to
the
unmitigated
stare
of
stephen
corbold
grey
eyes
the
constituting
himself
the
guide
and
protector
of
the
ladies
through
a
series
of
extemporary
preachings
and
lecturings
on
sunday
was
perhaps
too
obvious
a
duty
to
be
classed
as
one
of
love
invention
but
the
ingenuity
shown
in
persuading
mowbray
that
it
would
be
necessary
for
the
completion
of
her
business
that
he
should
attend
her
home
most
certainly
deserves
this
honour
though
no
way
wanting
in
that
quality
of
mind
which
the
invidious
denominate
impudence
and
the
judicious
proper
confidence
a
quality
as
necessary
to
the
fitting
out
of
stephen
corbold
as
parchment
and
red
tape
he
nevertheless
felt
some
slight
approach
to
hesitation
and
when
he
first
hinted
the
expediency
of
this
measure
but
his
embarrassment
was
instantly
relieved
by
mowbray
cordial
assurance
that
she
rejoiced
to
hear
such
a
manner
of
concluding
the
business
was
possible
as
she
knew
it
would
give
their
excellent
minister
pleasure
to
see
his
cousin
there
is
no
christian
virtue
perhaps
to
which
a
serious
widow
lady
is
so
often
called
unless
she
belong
to
that
class
invited
by
the
exemplary
in
bevies
by
way
of
charity
when
a
little
teapot
is
set
between
every
two
of
them
there
is
no
christian
virtue
more
constantly
inculcated
on
the
minds
of
serious
widows
than
that
of
hospitality
nor
is
there
a
text
that
has
been
quoted
oftener
to
such
or
with
greater
variety
of
accent
as
admonitory
encouragingly
beseechingly
approvingly
jeremiadingly
in
reproach
and
hallelujahingly
in
gratitude
and
admiration
than
those
three
impressive
and
laudatory
words
given
to
hospitality
during
a
snug
little
morning
visit
at
the
park
at
which
only
mowbray
and
fanny
were
present
cartwright
accidentally
turned
to
these
words
and
nothing
could
be
more
touchingly
eloquent
than
the
manner
in
which
he
dwelt
upon
and
explained
them
from
that
hour
good
mowbray
had
been
secretly
lamenting
the
want
of
sufficient
opportunity
to
show
how
fully
she
understood
and
valued
this
christian
virtue
and
how
willing
she
was
to
put
it
in
practice
toward
all
such
as
her
excellent
minister
should
approve
it
was
therefore
positively
with
an
of
fervent
zeal
that
she
welcomed
the
prospect
of
a
visit
from
a
as
stephen
corbold
it
is
indeed
a
blessing
and
a
happiness
corbold
said
she
that
what
i
feared
would
detain
me
many
days
from
my
home
and
my
family
should
be
converted
into
such
a
merciful
dispensation
as
i
must
consider
your
coming
to
be
when
shall
you
be
able
to
set
out
my
dear
sir
i
could
set
out
or
at
the
very
latest
the
day
after
if
i
could
obtain
a
conveyance
that
i
should
deem
perfectly
safe
for
the
papers
i
have
to
carry
helen
shuddered
for
she
saw
his
meaning
lurking
in
the
corner
of
his
eye
as
he
turned
towards
her
one
of
his
detested
glances
perhaps
said
mowbray
hesitatingly
and
fearful
that
she
might
be
taxing
his
great
too
far
perhaps
upon
such
an
urgent
occasion
you
might
have
the
great
goodness
corbold
to
submit
to
making
a
third
in
my
my
gratitude
would
indeed
be
very
great
for
such
a
permission
he
replied
endeavouring
to
betray
as
little
pleasure
as
possible
i
do
assure
you
my
dear
lady
such
precautions
are
far
from
unnecessary
heaven
for
its
own
especial
purposes
which
are
to
us
inscrutable
ordains
that
its
tender
care
to
usward
shall
be
shown
rather
by
giving
us
prudence
and
forethought
to
avoid
contact
with
the
wicked
than
by
any
removal
of
them
from
our
path
wherefore
i
hold
myself
bound
in
righteousness
to
confess
that
the
papers
concerning
your
affairs
even
yours
my
honoured
lady
might
run
a
very
fearful
risk
of
being
abducted
and
purloined
by
some
of
the
many
ungodly
persons
with
whom
no
dispensation
of
providence
hath
yet
interfered
to
prevent
their
jostling
its
own
people
when
they
travel
as
sometimes
unhappily
they
must
do
in
ah
mr
corbold
replied
the
widow
mentally
alluding
to
a
conversation
which
she
had
held
with
cartwright
on
the
separation
to
be
desired
between
the
chosen
and
the
even
in
this
world
such
being
as
he
said
a
sort
of
type
or
foreshowing
of
that
eternal
separation
promised
in
the
world
to
come
ah
corbold
if
i
had
the
power
to
prevent
it
none
of
the
chosen
should
ever
again
find
themselves
obliged
to
submit
to
such
promiscuous
mixture
with
the
ungodly
as
this
unsanctified
mode
of
travelling
must
lead
to
had
i
power
and
influence
sufficient
to
carry
such
an
undertaking
into
effect
i
would
certainly
endeavour
to
institute
a
society
of
christians
who
by
liberal
subscriptions
among
themselves
might
collect
a
fund
for
defraying
the
travelling
expenses
of
those
who
are
set
apart
it
must
be
an
abomination
corbold
that
such
should
be
seen
travelling
on
earth
by
the
same
vehicles
as
those
which
convey
the
wretched
beings
who
are
on
their
sure
and
certain
road
to
eternal
destruction
ah
dearest
madam
replied
the
attorney
with
a
profound
sigh
such
thoughts
as
those
are
buds
of
holiness
that
shall
burst
forth
into
flowers
of
eternal
glory
round
your
head
in
heaven
but
alas
no
such
society
is
yet
formed
and
the
sufferings
of
the
righteous
for
the
want
of
it
are
truly
great
i
am
sure
they
must
be
corbold
replied
the
kind
mowbray
in
an
accent
of
sincere
compassion
but
at
least
in
the
present
instance
you
may
be
spared
such
unseemly
mixture
if
you
will
be
good
enough
not
to
object
to
travelling
three
in
the
carriage
helen
is
very
slight
and
i
trust
you
will
not
be
greatly
incommoded
corbold
gratitude
was
too
great
to
be
expressed
in
a
sitting
attitude
he
therefore
rose
from
his
chair
and
pressing
his
extended
hands
together
as
if
invoking
a
blessing
on
the
meek
lady
holy
head
he
uttered
heaven
reward
you
madam
for
not
forgetting
those
whom
it
hath
remembered
and
as
he
spoke
he
bowed
his
head
low
long
and
reverently
as
he
recovered
the
erect
position
on
ordinary
occasions
permitted
to
man
he
turned
a
little
round
to
give
a
glance
of
very
timidity
towards
helen
who
when
he
began
his
reverence
to
her
mother
was
in
the
room
but
as
he
now
turned
his
disappointed
eyes
all
round
it
he
discovered
that
she
was
there
no
longer
after
this
the
business
which
could
as
corbold
said
be
conveniently
transacted
in
london
was
quickly
despatched
and
the
day
fixed
for
their
return
to
mowbray
exactly
one
week
after
they
left
it
stephen
corbold
was
invited
to
breakfast
previous
to
the
departure
and
he
came
accompanied
by
so
huge
a
green
bag
as
promised
a
long
stay
among
those
to
whose
affairs
the
voluminous
contents
related
when
all
things
in
and
about
the
carriage
were
ready
stephen
corbold
presented
his
arm
to
the
widow
and
placed
her
in
it
he
then
turned
to
helen
who
on
this
occasion
found
it
not
so
easy
as
at
setting
off
to
avoid
the
hand
extended
towards
her
that
is
to
say
she
could
not
spring
by
it
unheeded
but
as
she
would
greatly
have
preferred
the
touch
of
any
other
reptile
she
contrived
to
be
very
awkward
and
actually
caught
hold
of
the
handle
beside
the
instead
of
the
obsequious
ungloved
fingers
which
made
her
shudder
as
she
glanced
her
eyes
towards
them
you
will
sit
in
the
middle
helen
said
mowbray
i
wish
mamma
you
would
be
so
kind
as
to
let
me
sit
in
the
dickey
replied
the
young
lady
looking
up
as
she
spoke
to
the
very
comfortable
and
unoccupied
seat
in
front
of
the
carriage
which
but
for
mowbray
respectful
religious
scruples
might
certainly
have
accommodated
corbold
and
his
bag
perfectly
well
i
should
like
it
so
much
better
mamma
let
me
sit
in
the
middle
i
entreat
cried
corbold
entering
the
carriage
in
haste
to
prevent
farther
discussion
my
dear
young
lady
he
continued
placing
his
person
in
the
least
graceful
of
all
imaginable
attitudes
my
dear
young
lady
i
beseech
you
go
into
the
corner
helen
said
mowbray
hastily
wishing
to
put
so
exemplary
a
christian
more
at
his
ease
and
without
thinking
it
necessary
to
answer
the
insidious
petition
of
her
daughter
which
as
she
thought
plainly
pointed
at
the
exclusion
of
the
righteous
attorney
helen
ventured
not
to
repeat
it
and
the
carriage
drove
off
for
the
first
mile
stephen
corbold
sat
or
rather
perched
himself
at
the
extremest
edge
of
the
seat
his
hat
between
his
knees
and
every
muscle
that
ought
to
have
been
at
rest
in
active
exercise
to
prevent
his
falling
forward
on
his
nose
every
feature
meanwhile
seeming
to
say
this
is
not
my
carriage
but
by
gentle
degrees
he
slid
farther
and
farther
backwards
till
his
spare
person
was
not
only
in
the
enjoyment
of
ease
but
of
great
happiness
also
helen
as
her
mother
observed
was
very
slight
and
corbold
began
almost
to
fancy
that
she
would
at
last
vanish
into
thin
air
for
as
he
quietly
advanced
so
did
she
quietly
retreat
till
she
certainly
did
appear
to
shrink
into
a
very
small
compass
indeed
i
fear
i
crowd
you
my
dearest
lady
he
said
addressing
mowbray
at
least
ten
times
during
as
many
miles
and
every
time
this
fear
came
over
him
he
gave
her
a
little
more
room
dreadfully
to
the
annoyance
of
the
slight
young
lady
on
the
other
side
of
him
poor
helen
had
need
to
remember
that
she
was
going
home
going
to
rosalind
to
enable
her
to
endure
the
disgust
of
her
position
but
for
several
hours
she
did
bear
it
heroically
she
thought
of
mowbray
of
her
of
the
beautiful
park
of
rosalind
snug
and
the
contrast
of
all
this
to
the
life
she
had
led
in
london
she
thought
too
of
oakley
and
of
the
possibility
that
some
of
the
family
might
by
some
accident
or
other
be
met
in
some
of
the
walks
which
rosalind
and
she
would
be
sure
to
take
in
short
with
her
eyes
incessantly
turned
through
the
open
window
towards
the
hedges
and
ditches
the
fields
and
the
flowers
by
the
she
contrived
to
keep
herself
body
and
soul
as
far
as
possible
from
the
hated
being
who
sat
beside
her
on
the
journey
to
london
mowbray
had
not
thought
it
necessary
to
stop
for
dinner
on
the
road
both
she
and
helen
preferring
to
take
a
sandwich
in
the
carriage
but
from
the
fear
of
infringing
any
of
the
duties
of
that
hospitality
which
she
now
held
in
such
high
veneration
she
arranged
matters
differently
and
learning
upon
consulting
her
footman
that
an
excellent
house
was
situated
about
between
london
and
wrexhill
she
not
only
determined
on
stopping
there
but
directed
the
man
to
send
forward
a
note
ordering
an
early
dinner
to
be
ready
for
them
this
halt
was
an
agreeable
surprise
to
stephen
corbold
it
was
indeed
an
arrangement
such
as
those
of
his
peculiar
sect
are
generally
found
to
approve
for
it
is
a
remarkable
fact
easily
ascertained
by
any
who
will
give
themselves
the
trouble
of
inquiry
that
the
serious
christians
of
the
present
age
indulge
themselves
bodily
whenever
the
power
of
doing
so
falls
in
their
way
exactly
in
proportion
to
the
mortifications
and
privations
with
which
they
torment
their
spirits
so
that
while
a
young
sinner
would
fly
from
an
untasted
glass
of
claret
that
he
might
not
lose
the
prologue
to
a
new
play
a
young
saint
would
sip
up
if
he
could
get
them
while
descanting
on
the
grievous
pains
of
hell
which
the
pursuit
of
pleasure
must
for
ever
bring
the
repast
and
even
the
wine
did
honour
to
the
recommendation
of
the
careful
and
experienced
thomas
and
mowbray
had
the
sincere
satisfaction
of
seeing
corbold
pauvre
homme
eat
half
a
pound
of
salmon
of
a
leg
of
lamb
and
of
a
large
with
a
degree
of
relish
that
proved
to
her
that
she
was
very
right
to
stop
for
dinner
nothing
can
show
gratitude
for
such
little
attentions
as
these
so
pleasantly
and
so
effectually
as
taking
full
advantage
of
them
corbold
indeed
carried
this
feeling
so
far
that
even
after
the
two
ladies
had
left
the
room
he
stepped
back
and
pretty
nearly
emptied
the
two
decanters
of
wine
before
he
rejoined
them
the
latter
part
of
the
journey
produced
a
very
disagreeable
scene
which
though
it
ended
as
helen
thought
at
the
time
most
delightfully
for
her
was
productive
in
its
consequences
of
many
a
bitter
it
is
probable
that
the
good
cheer
at
d
together
with
the
final
libation
that
washed
it
down
conveyed
more
than
ordinary
animation
to
the
animal
spirits
of
the
attorney
and
for
some
miles
he
discoursed
with
more
than
his
usual
unction
on
the
sins
of
the
sinful
and
the
holiness
of
the
holy
till
poor
dear
mowbray
despite
her
vehement
struggles
to
keep
her
eyes
open
fell
fast
asleep
no
sooner
was
stephen
corbold
fully
aware
of
this
fact
than
he
began
making
some
very
tender
speeches
to
helen
for
some
time
her
only
reply
was
expressed
by
thrusting
her
head
still
farther
out
of
the
side
window
but
this
did
not
avail
her
long
as
if
to
intimate
to
her
that
a
person
whose
attention
could
not
be
obtained
through
the
medium
of
the
ears
must
be
roused
from
their
apathy
by
the
touch
he
took
her
hand
upon
this
she
turned
as
suddenly
as
if
an
adder
had
stung
her
and
fixing
her
eyes
beaming
with
rage
and
indignation
upon
him
said
if
you
venture
sir
to
repeat
this
insult
i
will
call
to
the
postillions
to
stop
and
order
the
footman
instantly
to
take
you
out
of
the
carriage
he
returned
her
glance
however
rather
with
passion
than
repentance
and
audaciously
putting
his
arm
round
her
waist
drew
her
towards
him
while
he
whispered
in
her
ear
what
would
your
dear
good
mamma
say
to
that
had
he
possessed
the
cunning
of
mephistophiles
he
could
not
have
uttered
words
more
calculated
to
unnerve
her
the
terrible
conviction
that
it
was
indeed
possible
her
mother
might
justify
excuse
or
at
any
rate
pardon
the
action
came
upon
her
heart
like
ice
and
burying
her
face
in
her
hands
she
burst
into
tears
had
stephen
corbold
been
a
wise
man
he
would
have
here
ceased
his
persecution
he
saw
that
she
was
humbled
to
the
dust
by
the
reference
he
had
so
skilfully
made
to
her
mother
and
perhaps
had
he
emptied
only
one
decanter
he
might
have
decided
that
it
would
be
desirable
to
leave
her
in
that
state
of
mind
but
as
it
was
he
had
the
very
exceeding
audacity
once
more
to
put
his
arm
round
her
and
by
a
sudden
and
most
unexpected
movement
impressed
a
kiss
upon
her
cheek
helen
uttered
a
piercing
scream
and
mowbray
opening
her
eyes
demanded
in
a
voice
of
alarm
what
is
the
matter
corbold
sat
profoundly
silent
but
helen
answered
in
great
agitation
i
can
remain
in
the
carriage
no
longer
mamma
unless
you
turn
out
this
man
oh
helen
helen
what
can
you
mean
by
using
such
language
answered
her
mother
it
is
pride
i
know
abominable
pride
i
have
seen
it
from
the
very
first
which
leads
you
to
treat
this
excellent
man
as
you
do
do
you
forget
that
he
is
the
relation
as
well
as
the
friend
of
our
minister
fie
upon
it
helen
you
must
bring
down
this
haughty
spirit
to
something
more
approaching
meek
christian
humility
or
you
and
i
shall
never
be
able
to
live
together
it
seems
almost
like
a
paradox
and
yet
it
is
perfectly
true
that
had
not
mowbray
from
very
as
she
said
perceived
the
utter
vulgarity
in
person
language
and
demeanour
of
the
vicar
cousin
she
would
have
been
greatly
less
observant
and
punctilious
in
her
civilities
towards
him
nor
would
she
have
been
so
fatally
ready
to
quarrel
with
her
daughter
for
testifying
her
dislike
of
a
man
who
her
own
taste
told
her
would
be
detestable
were
not
the
holiness
of
his
principles
such
as
to
redeem
every
defect
with
which
nature
education
and
habit
had
afflicted
him
the
more
mowbray
felt
disposed
to
shrink
from
an
intimate
association
with
the
serious
attorney
the
more
strenuously
did
she
force
her
nature
to
endure
him
and
feeling
almost
unconsciously
perhaps
that
it
was
impossible
helen
should
not
detest
him
she
put
all
her
power
and
authority
in
action
not
only
to
prevent
her
showing
it
but
to
prevent
also
so
very
sinful
and
a
sentiment
from
taking
hold
upon
her
young
mind
helen
however
was
too
much
irritated
at
this
moment
to
submit
as
she
had
been
ever
used
to
do
to
the
commands
of
her
mother
and
still
feeling
the
pressure
of
the
serious
attorney
person
against
her
own
she
let
down
the
front
glass
and
very
resolutely
called
to
the
postillions
to
stop
the
boy
who
rode
the
wheeler
immediately
heard
and
obeyed
her
tell
the
servant
to
open
the
door
said
she
with
a
firmness
and
decision
which
she
afterwards
recalled
to
herself
with
astonishment
thomas
who
the
moment
the
carriage
stopped
had
got
down
obeyed
the
call
she
now
addressed
to
him
opened
the
door
gave
her
his
arm
and
before
either
mowbray
or
the
serious
attorney
either
had
fully
recovered
from
their
astonishment
helen
was
comfortably
seated
on
the
dickey
enjoying
the
cool
breeze
of
a
delicious
afternoon
upon
her
flushed
cheek
the
turn
which
was
given
to
this
transaction
by
stephen
corbold
during
the
conversation
he
enjoyed
for
the
rest
of
the
journey
with
the
young
lady
mother
was
such
as
to
do
credit
to
his
acuteness
and
that
good
lady
part
in
it
showed
plainly
that
the
new
doctrines
she
had
so
rapidly
imbibed
while
pretending
to
purify
her
heart
had
most
lamentably
perverted
her
judgment
chapter
vi
the
return
on
reaching
mowbray
the
first
figure
which
greeted
the
eyes
of
the
travellers
was
that
of
charles
stationed
on
the
portico
steps
waiting
to
receive
them
a
line
from
helen
to
rosalind
written
only
the
day
before
announced
their
intended
return
but
the
appearance
of
charles
was
a
surprise
to
them
and
to
helen
certainly
the
most
delightful
that
she
could
have
experienced
cartwright
had
written
a
long
and
very
edifying
letter
to
mowbray
informing
her
of
the
unexpected
arrival
of
her
son
from
the
scene
of
his
studies
and
making
such
comments
upon
it
as
in
his
wisdom
seemed
good
but
though
this
too
was
written
in
the
secret
recesses
of
his
own
chamber
with
many
affecting
little
circumstances
demonstrative
of
his
holy
and
gentle
emotions
while
so
employed
it
was
nevertheless
under
the
influence
of
still
riper
wisdom
subsequently
destroyed
because
he
thought
that
the
first
surprise
occasioned
by
the
young
unwonted
appearance
would
be
more
likely
to
produce
the
effect
he
desired
than
even
his
statement
neither
rosalind
nor
charles
himself
had
written
because
they
were
both
unwilling
to
state
the
real
cause
of
his
coming
and
thought
the
plea
of
would
pass
off
better
in
conversation
than
on
paper
that
fanny
should
write
nothing
which
good
cartwright
did
not
wish
known
can
be
matter
of
surprise
to
no
one
helen
who
had
descried
charles
before
the
carriage
stopped
descended
from
her
lofty
position
with
dangerous
rapidity
and
sprang
into
his
arms
with
a
degree
of
delight
greater
perhaps
than
she
had
ever
before
felt
at
seeing
him
the
exclamation
of
mowbray
certainly
had
in
it
as
the
wise
vicar
predicted
a
tone
that
indicated
displeasure
as
well
as
surprise
and
the
embrace
which
she
could
not
refuse
was
so
much
less
cordial
than
it
was
wont
to
be
that
he
turned
again
to
helen
and
once
more
pressed
her
to
his
heart
as
if
to
console
him
for
the
want
of
tenderness
in
his
mother
kiss
meanwhile
stephen
corbold
stood
under
the
lofty
portico
lost
in
admiration
at
the
splendid
appearance
of
the
house
and
grounds
mowbray
with
a
sort
of
instinctive
feeling
that
this
excellent
person
might
not
altogether
find
himself
at
his
ease
with
her
family
hastened
towards
him
determined
that
her
own
christian
humility
should
at
least
set
them
a
good
example
and
putting
out
both
her
hands
towards
him
exclaimed
with
an
earnestness
that
sounded
almost
like
the
voice
of
prayer
welcome
dear
corbold
to
my
house
and
home
and
may
you
find
in
it
the
comfort
and
hospitality
your
exemplary
character
deserves
then
turning
to
her
son
she
added
i
know
not
how
long
you
are
likely
to
stay
away
from
college
charles
but
while
you
are
here
i
beg
that
you
will
exert
yourself
to
the
very
utmost
to
make
mowbray
agreeable
to
this
gentleman
and
remember
if
you
please
that
his
religious
principles
and
truly
edifying
christian
sentiments
are
exactly
such
as
i
would
wish
to
place
before
you
as
an
example
charles
turned
round
towards
the
serious
attorney
intending
to
welcome
him
by
an
extended
hand
but
the
thing
was
impossible
there
was
that
in
his
aspect
with
which
he
felt
that
he
could
never
hold
fellowship
and
his
salutation
was
turned
into
a
ceremonious
bow
a
change
which
it
was
the
less
difficult
to
make
from
the
respectful
distance
at
which
the
stranger
guest
placed
himself
while
preparing
to
receive
the
young
man
welcome
though
rosalind
had
purposely
remained
in
her
own
apartment
till
the
first
meeting
with
charles
was
over
helen
was
already
in
her
arms
having
exchanged
a
hasty
kiss
with
fanny
whom
she
met
in
the
hall
hastening
to
receive
her
mother
oh
my
dearest
rosalind
how
thankful
am
i
to
be
once
more
with
you
again
i
never
i
think
shall
be
able
to
endure
the
sight
of
london
again
as
long
as
i
live
i
have
been
so
very
very
wretched
there
upon
my
word
helen
i
have
not
lived
upon
roses
since
you
went
you
can
hardly
be
so
glad
to
come
back
as
i
am
to
have
you
what
did
your
mother
say
on
seeing
charles
i
hardly
know
she
did
not
i
think
seem
pleased
to
see
him
but
i
am
more
delighted
at
the
chance
that
has
brought
him
let
it
be
what
it
will
than
i
have
words
to
express
oh
it
is
such
a
blessing
to
me
dear
dear
charles
he
knows
not
what
a
treasure
he
is
the
very
sight
of
him
has
cured
all
my
sorrows
and
yet
i
was
dreadfully
miserable
just
now
then
thank
heaven
he
is
here
my
own
helen
but
tell
me
dearest
what
is
it
has
made
you
miserable
though
you
tell
me
it
is
over
the
tears
seemed
ready
to
start
when
you
said
so
oh
my
woes
will
make
a
long
story
rosalind
and
some
of
them
must
be
for
your
ear
only
but
this
shall
be
at
night
when
nobody
is
near
to
hear
us
but
by
the
way
you
must
have
a
great
deal
to
tell
me
how
comes
it
that
charles
is
here
and
what
seems
stranger
still
how
comes
it
that
as
he
is
here
you
have
not
been
living
upon
roses
my
woes
may
make
a
story
as
well
as
yours
helen
and
a
long
one
too
if
i
tell
all
but
it
must
come
out
by
degrees
a
series
of
sketches
rather
than
an
history
have
you
seen
any
body
from
oakley
rosalind
ah
helen
said
rosalind
smiling
as
she
watched
the
bright
colour
mounting
even
to
the
brows
of
her
friend
your
history
then
has
had
nothing
in
it
to
prevent
your
remembering
oakley
my
history
as
you
call
it
rosalind
has
been
made
up
of
a
series
of
mortifications
some
of
them
have
almost
broken
my
heart
and
my
spirit
too
but
others
have
irritated
me
into
a
degree
of
courage
and
daring
that
might
perhaps
have
surprised
you
and
every
thing
that
has
happened
to
me
has
sent
my
thoughts
back
to
my
home
and
to
my
friends
all
my
friends
rosalind
with
a
degree
of
clinging
and
dependent
affection
such
as
i
never
felt
before
my
poor
helen
but
look
up
dearest
and
shed
no
tears
if
you
can
help
it
we
all
seem
to
be
placed
in
a
very
singular
and
unexpected
position
my
dear
friend
but
it
is
not
tears
that
will
help
us
out
of
it
this
new
man
this
vicar
seems
inclined
to
go
such
lengths
with
his
fanatical
hypocrisy
that
i
have
good
hopes
your
mother
and
fanny
will
ere
long
get
sick
of
him
and
his
new
lights
and
then
all
will
go
right
again
depend
upon
it
all
that
has
hitherto
gone
wrong
has
been
wholly
owing
to
him
i
certainly
do
not
think
that
your
poor
father
will
was
made
in
the
spirit
of
wisdom
but
even
would
have
produced
none
of
the
effects
it
has
done
had
not
this
hateful
man
instilled
within
ten
minutes
after
the
will
was
read
the
poison
of
doubt
and
suspicion
against
charles
into
the
mind
of
your
mother
do
you
not
remember
his
voice
and
his
look
helen
when
he
entered
the
room
where
we
were
all
three
sitting
with
your
mother
i
am
sure
i
shall
never
forget
him
i
saw
in
an
instant
that
he
intended
to
make
your
mother
believe
that
charles
resented
the
will
and
that
instead
of
coming
himself
he
had
sent
him
to
your
mother
to
tell
her
of
it
i
hated
him
then
and
every
hour
that
has
passed
since
has
made
me
hate
him
more
but
let
us
take
hope
helen
even
from
the
excess
of
the
evil
your
mother
can
not
long
remain
blind
to
his
real
character
and
when
once
she
sees
him
as
he
is
she
will
again
become
the
dear
kind
mother
you
have
all
so
fondly
loved
could
i
hope
this
rosalind
for
the
future
there
is
nothing
i
could
not
endure
patiently
for
the
present
at
least
nothing
that
could
possibly
happen
while
charles
is
here
but
i
do
not
hope
it
there
was
a
melancholy
earnestness
in
helen
voice
as
she
pronounced
the
last
words
that
sounded
like
a
heavy
prophecy
of
evil
to
come
in
the
ears
of
rosalind
heaven
help
us
then
she
exclaimed
if
we
are
really
to
live
under
the
influence
and
authority
of
the
vicar
of
wrexhill
our
fate
will
be
dreadful
if
your
dear
father
had
but
been
spared
to
us
a
few
years
longer
if
you
and
i
were
but
helen
how
different
would
be
the
light
in
which
i
should
view
all
that
now
alarms
us
my
fortune
would
be
plenty
for
both
of
us
and
i
would
take
you
with
me
to
ireland
and
we
would
live
with
oh
rosalind
how
can
you
talk
so
idly
do
you
think
that
any
thing
would
make
me
leave
my
poor
dear
mother
if
you
were
to
marry
for
instance
i
should
never
do
that
without
her
consent
and
that
you
know
would
hardly
be
leaving
her
well
and
our
innocency
defend
and
guard
us
for
i
do
think
helen
we
are
in
a
position
that
threatens
vexation
to
say
the
least
of
it
i
wonder
if
miss
cartwright
visit
is
to
end
with
your
absence
she
is
the
very
oddest
personage
sometimes
i
pity
her
sometimes
i
almost
admire
her
sometimes
i
feel
afraid
of
her
but
never
by
any
chance
can
i
continue
even
to
fancy
that
i
understand
her
character
indeed
yet
in
general
you
set
about
that
rather
rapidly
rosalind
but
must
we
not
go
down
i
have
hardly
seen
fanny
and
i
long
to
talk
a
little
to
my
own
dear
charles
and
you
will
like
to
have
some
tea
after
your
journey
mowbray
i
think
never
stops
in
general
she
does
not
but
a
shudder
ran
through
limbs
as
she
remembered
the
travelling
adventures
of
the
day
and
she
stopped
you
look
tired
and
pale
helen
come
down
take
some
tea
and
then
go
to
bed
directly
if
we
do
not
act
with
promptitude
and
decision
in
this
matter
we
shall
set
up
talking
all
night
as
they
passed
miss
cartwright
door
rosalind
knocked
and
that
young
lady
immediately
opened
it
oh
you
are
come
back
then
i
fancied
by
cartwright
not
coming
this
evening
that
something
might
have
occurred
to
prevent
you
if
it
had
said
helen
smiling
it
must
have
been
announced
by
express
for
you
can
only
have
had
my
letter
this
morning
true
replied
miss
cartwright
when
the
three
young
ladies
entered
the
they
found
nobody
in
it
but
stephen
corbold
mowbray
having
gone
with
fanny
to
her
own
room
and
charles
ensconced
himself
in
the
library
to
avoid
a
with
the
stranger
rosalind
gave
him
a
glance
and
then
looked
at
helen
with
an
eye
that
seemed
to
say
who
in
the
world
have
you
brought
us
helen
however
gave
no
glance
of
intelligence
in
return
but
walking
to
a
table
which
stood
in
that
part
of
the
room
which
was
at
the
greatest
distance
from
the
place
occupied
by
corbold
she
sat
down
and
began
earnestly
reading
an
old
newspaper
that
she
found
upon
it
miss
cartwright
started
on
recognising
her
cousin
and
though
she
condescended
to
pronounce
how
do
you
do
mr
corbold
there
was
but
a
cold
welcome
to
him
expressed
either
by
her
voice
or
manner
no
one
presented
him
to
rosalind
and
altogether
he
felt
as
little
at
his
ease
as
it
was
well
possible
for
a
gentleman
to
do
when
the
door
opened
and
mowbray
and
fanny
appeared
from
that
moment
he
became
as
much
distinguished
as
he
was
before
overlooked
fanny
who
knew
that
it
was
cartwright
cousin
who
stood
bowing
to
her
delighted
at
the
honour
of
being
told
that
she
was
miss
fanny
mowbray
received
him
with
a
kindness
and
condescension
which
soothed
her
own
feelings
as
much
as
his
for
she
felt
that
every
word
she
spoke
to
him
was
a
proof
of
her
devotion
to
her
dear
good
cartwright
and
that
when
he
heard
of
it
he
could
not
fail
to
understand
that
it
was
for
his
sake
the
party
retired
early
ostensibly
for
the
sake
of
the
travellers
but
perhaps
the
real
cause
of
this
general
haste
to
separate
was
that
they
all
felt
themselves
singularly
embarrassed
in
each
other
company
before
mowbray
had
been
five
minutes
in
her
house
she
had
ordered
a
splendid
sleeping
apartment
to
be
made
ready
for
corbold
and
the
first
after
retiring
to
it
was
spent
by
him
in
taking
an
accurate
survey
of
its
furniture
and
dimensions
after
which
he
very
nearly
stifled
himself
forgetful
of
the
by
striving
to
enjoy
the
full
luxury
of
the
abounding
pillows
with
which
his
magnificent
couch
was
furnished
mowbray
and
fanny
separated
after
a
short
but
confidential
colloquy
miss
cartwright
took
her
solitary
way
to
her
chamber
where
as
the
housemaids
asserted
she
certainly
spent
half
the
night
in
reading
or
writing
or
something
or
other
before
she
put
out
her
light
and
rosalind
and
helen
spite
of
their
good
resolutions
not
only
sat
up
talking
in
the
library
themselves
but
permitted
charles
to
share
their
watch
with
them
so
that
before
they
separated
every
fact
thought
or
opinion
treasured
in
the
minds
of
each
were
most
unreservedly
communicated
to
the
others
excepting
that
helen
did
not
disclose
at
full
length
the
reasons
she
had
for
detesting
corbold
and
charles
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
mention
that
rosalind
grew
fairer
to
his
eyes
and
dearer
to
his
heart
every
hour
chapter
vii
the
vicar
and
his
cousin
none
of
the
mowbray
family
were
present
at
the
meeting
between
the
vicar
of
wrexhill
and
his
cousin
the
latter
indeed
set
out
from
the
park
at
a
very
early
hour
on
the
morning
after
his
arrival
in
order
to
breakfast
with
his
much
esteemed
relation
and
to
enjoy
in
the
privacy
of
his
vicarage
a
little
friendly
and
confidential
conversation
as
to
the
projects
and
intentions
concerning
him
which
had
been
hinted
at
in
his
letters
he
was
welcomed
by
cartwright
with
very
obliging
civility
not
but
that
the
vicar
felt
and
showed
upon
this
as
well
as
all
other
occasions
a
very
proper
consciousness
of
his
own
superiority
in
all
ways
however
the
corbold
connexion
had
been
very
essentially
useful
to
him
in
days
past
and
stephen
the
present
representative
of
the
family
might
be
extremely
useful
to
him
in
days
to
come
several
eggs
were
therefore
placed
on
the
table
coffee
was
added
to
tea
and
his
reception
in
all
ways
such
as
to
make
stephen
feel
himself
extremely
comfortable
when
the
repast
was
ended
jacob
received
a
hint
to
withdraw
and
as
soon
as
the
door
was
closed
behind
him
the
serious
vicar
approached
his
chair
to
that
of
the
serious
attorney
with
the
air
of
one
who
had
much
to
hear
and
much
to
communicate
you
seem
hereunto
cousin
stephen
to
have
managed
this
excellent
business
which
under
providence
i
have
been
enabled
to
put
into
your
hands
with
great
ability
and
by
a
continuation
of
mercy
i
am
not
without
hope
that
you
will
as
i
heretofore
hinted
bring
the
same
to
good
effect
there
is
hope
great
and
exceeding
merciful
hope
cousin
william
that
all
you
have
anticipated
and
peradventure
more
too
may
come
to
pass
a
blessing
and
a
providence
seem
already
to
have
lighted
upon
you
cousin
in
your
new
ministry
for
into
this
vessel
which
your
cousinly
kindness
hath
set
within
my
sight
you
have
poured
grace
and
abounding
righteousness
surely
there
never
was
a
lady
endowed
with
such
goodly
gifts
who
was
more
disposed
to
make
a
offering
of
them
to
the
saints
than
this
pious
and
in
all
ways
exemplary
widow
your
remarks
cousin
are
those
of
a
man
on
whom
the
light
shines
may
the
mercy
of
heaven
strengthen
unto
you
for
its
glory
the
talent
it
hath
bestowed
and
now
with
the
freedom
of
kinsmen
who
speak
together
tell
to
me
what
are
the
hopes
and
expectations
to
which
your
conversation
with
this
excellent
and
already
very
serious
lady
have
given
birth
i
have
no
wish
or
intention
cousin
william
of
hiding
from
you
any
portion
of
the
thoughts
which
it
has
pleased
providence
to
send
into
my
heart
the
which
are
in
fact
for
the
most
part
founded
upon
the
suggestions
which
by
the
light
of
truth
i
discerned
in
the
first
letter
upon
the
widow
mowbray
affairs
which
you
addressed
unto
me
respecting
the
agency
of
her
own
business
and
peradventure
that
of
her
ward
also
even
so
i
have
in
truth
faith
and
hope
that
by
the
continuation
of
your
friendship
and
good
report
cousin
william
i
may
at
no
distant
period
attain
unto
both
and
if
you
do
cousin
stephen
returned
the
vicar
with
a
smile
your
in
the
parish
of
wrexhill
will
be
worth
considerably
more
than
mine
a
serious
waggish
holy
cunning
smile
now
illuminated
the
red
dry
features
of
the
attorney
and
shaking
his
head
with
a
of
meaning
he
said
ah
cousin
the
vicar
smiled
again
and
rising
from
his
chair
put
his
head
and
shoulders
out
of
the
open
window
looking
carefully
as
it
seemed
in
all
directions
then
drawing
them
in
again
he
proceeded
to
open
the
door
of
the
room
and
examined
the
passage
leading
to
it
in
the
same
cautious
manner
my
son
jacob
is
one
of
the
finest
young
men
in
europe
cousin
stephen
said
the
vicar
reseating
himself
but
he
is
young
and
as
full
of
little
childish
innocent
fooleries
as
any
baby
so
it
is
as
well
not
to
speak
all
we
may
have
to
say
without
knowing
that
we
are
alone
for
many
an
excellent
plan
in
which
providence
seemed
to
have
taken
a
great
share
has
been
impiously
spoiled
frustrated
and
destroyed
by
the
want
of
caution
in
those
to
whom
it
was
intrusted
let
not
such
sin
lie
at
our
door
now
tell
me
then
cousin
stephen
and
tell
me
frankly
why
did
you
smile
and
say
cousin
because
while
speaking
of
what
through
mercy
i
may
get
at
wrexhill
it
seemed
to
me
like
a
misdoubting
of
providence
not
to
speak
a
little
hint
of
what
its
chosen
minister
there
may
get
too
i
get
my
vicar
dues
cousin
stephen
and
it
may
be
by
a
blessing
upon
my
humble
endeavours
i
may
when
next
easter
falls
obtain
some
trifle
both
from
high
and
low
in
the
way
of
easter
offering
ah
cousin
repeated
the
attorney
renewing
his
intelligent
smile
well
then
said
the
vicar
speak
out
i
am
but
a
plodding
man
of
business
replied
corbold
with
such
illumination
upon
matters
of
faith
as
providence
hath
been
pleased
to
bestow
but
my
sense
such
as
it
is
tells
me
that
the
excellent
and
pious
widow
of
mowbray
park
will
not
always
be
permitted
by
providence
to
remain
desolate
she
does
in
truth
deserve
a
better
fate
rejoined
the
vicar
and
what
better
fate
can
befall
her
cousin
william
than
being
bound
together
in
holy
matrimony
with
one
of
the
most
shining
lights
to
be
found
among
the
saints
on
earth
yes
responded
the
vicar
with
a
sigh
that
is
the
fate
she
merits
and
that
is
the
fate
she
ought
to
meet
and
shall
we
doubt
providence
shall
we
doubt
that
a
mate
shall
be
found
for
her
no
cousin
william
doubt
not
for
i
say
unto
thee
art
the
man
the
vicar
endeavoured
to
look
solemn
but
though
his
handsome
features
were
in
general
under
excellent
control
he
could
not
at
this
moment
repress
a
pleasant
sort
of
simpering
smile
that
puckered
round
his
mouth
stephen
corbold
perceiving
that
his
cousin
was
in
nowise
displeased
by
the
prophecy
he
had
taken
the
liberty
to
utter
returned
to
the
subject
again
saying
i
wish
you
had
seen
her
face
she
must
have
been
very
like
her
daughter
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
her
cousin
william
every
time
i
named
you
indeed
did
she
really
testify
some
emotion
i
trust
you
are
not
jesting
cousin
stephen
this
is
no
subject
for
pleasantry
most
assuredly
it
is
not
and
i
think
that
you
must
altogether
have
forgotten
my
temper
and
character
if
you
suppose
that
i
should
think
it
such
to
tell
you
the
truth
cousin
i
look
upon
the
time
present
as
a
period
marked
and
settled
by
providence
for
the
calling
you
up
to
the
high
places
will
it
not
be
a
glory
to
have
its
minister
and
servant
placed
in
such
a
palace
as
mowbray
and
will
it
not
be
converting
what
hitherto
has
doubtless
been
the
abode
of
sinners
into
a
temple
for
the
elect
i
will
not
deny
replied
the
vicar
that
such
thoughts
have
occasionally
found
place
in
my
own
mind
there
have
already
been
some
very
singular
and
remarkable
manifestations
in
this
matter
and
it
is
the
perceiving
this
which
has
led
me
to
believe
and
indeed
feel
certain
that
my
duty
calls
upon
me
so
to
act
that
this
wealthy
relict
of
a
man
too
much
addicted
to
the
things
of
this
world
may
finally
by
becoming
part
and
parcel
of
myself
lose
not
the
things
eternal
i
greatly
rejoice
rejoined
corbold
that
such
is
your
decision
in
this
matter
and
if
it
should
so
fall
out
that
heaven
in
its
wisdom
and
goodness
shall
ordain
you
to
become
the
master
of
mowbray
park
at
these
words
the
vicar
cast
his
eyes
upon
the
ground
and
meekly
bowed
his
head
and
i
have
a
persuasion
that
it
will
so
ordain
borne
strongly
in
upon
my
mind
then
and
in
that
case
cousin
william
i
trust
that
your
patronage
and
support
will
not
be
withdrawn
from
me
cousin
stephen
replied
the
vicar
you
are
a
man
that
on
many
occasions
i
shall
covet
and
desire
to
have
by
me
and
near
me
both
for
your
profit
and
advantage
and
my
own
but
in
the
case
which
you
have
put
and
which
heaven
seems
to
have
whispered
to
your
soul
in
the
case
stephen
that
i
should
ever
become
the
master
and
owner
of
mowbray
and
all
the
sundry
properties
thereunto
belonging
i
think
no
offence
to
you
cousin
that
i
should
prefer
managing
the
estates
myself
the
serious
attorney
looked
somewhat
crestfallen
and
perhaps
some
such
questionings
were
borne
in
upon
his
mind
as
what
is
it
to
me
if
he
marries
the
widow
if
i
do
not
get
the
management
of
the
estates
when
the
vicar
raised
his
eyes
to
the
face
of
his
cousin
he
probably
perceived
the
impression
his
words
had
produced
and
kindly
anxious
to
restore
him
to
more
comfortable
feelings
he
added
the
fine
property
of
miss
torrington
cousin
stephen
might
certainly
be
placed
entirely
in
your
hands
the
management
of
it
i
mean
till
she
comes
of
age
but
then
if
she
marries
my
son
which
i
think
not
unlikely
it
is
probable
that
jacob
may
follow
my
example
and
prefer
taking
care
of
the
property
himself
then
at
the
very
best
replied
corbold
i
can
only
hope
to
obtain
an
agency
for
a
year
or
two
i
beg
your
pardon
cousin
my
hopes
for
you
go
much
farther
than
that
in
the
first
place
i
would
recommend
it
to
you
immediately
to
settle
yourself
at
wrexhill
i
am
told
that
there
is
a
good
deal
of
business
up
and
down
the
country
hereabouts
and
if
i
obtain
the
influence
that
i
hope
to
do
in
more
ways
than
one
i
shall
take
care
that
no
attorney
is
employed
but
yourself
cousin
stephen
besides
this
i
know
that
there
may
happen
to
be
settlements
or
wills
wanting
amongst
us
my
good
friend
which
may
make
your
being
at
hand
very
convenient
and
in
all
such
cases
you
would
do
your
work
you
know
pretty
much
at
your
own
price
all
this
however
is
only
contingent
i
am
quite
aware
of
that
and
therefore
in
order
that
you
may
in
some
sort
share
my
good
fortune
if
such
indeed
should
fall
upon
me
i
have
been
thinking
cousin
stephen
that
when
i
shall
be
married
to
this
lady
whom
it
has
pleased
providence
to
place
in
my
path
you
being
then
the
near
relative
of
a
person
of
consequence
and
high
consideration
in
the
county
may
also
aspire
to
increase
your
means
by
the
same
holy
ordinance
and
if
such
a
measure
should
seem
good
to
your
judgment
i
have
a
lady
in
my
eye
also
a
widow
and
a
very
charming
one
my
dear
friend
who
lives
in
a
style
that
shows
her
to
be
favoured
by
providence
with
the
goods
of
fortune
what
say
you
to
this
cousin
stephen
why
it
is
borne
in
upon
me
to
say
cousin
william
that
in
such
a
case
as
this
i
should
be
inclined
to
follow
your
good
example
and
choose
for
myself
and
truth
to
speak
i
believe
the
choice
is
in
some
sort
made
already
and
i
do
see
but
your
marriage
may
be
as
likely
to
help
me
in
this
case
as
in
the
other
and
as
to
fortune
it
is
probable
that
you
may
be
able
to
lend
me
a
helping
hand
there
too
for
the
young
lady
i
fancy
is
no
other
than
your
own
that
is
to
be
the
pretty
miss
helen
cousin
william
the
vicar
as
he
listened
to
these
words
very
nearly
uttered
a
whistle
he
was
however
as
he
whispered
to
himself
mercifully
saved
from
such
an
indecorum
by
the
timely
remembrance
that
his
cousin
though
an
attorney
was
a
very
serious
man
but
though
he
did
not
whistle
he
deemed
it
necessary
to
express
in
a
more
solemn
and
proper
manner
his
doubts
of
the
success
to
be
hoped
from
the
scheme
proposed
by
corbold
as
to
the
fortune
of
the
young
person
who
may
as
you
observe
some
day
by
the
blessing
of
providence
become
my
i
must
tell
you
as
a
friend
and
kinsman
cousin
stephen
that
i
hold
it
to
be
very
doubtful
if
she
ever
have
any
fortune
at
all
are
you
aware
that
she
is
not
regenerate
i
partly
guess
as
much
replied
the
attorney
but
he
added
with
a
smile
i
ca
say
i
should
have
any
objection
to
marrying
her
first
and
leading
her
into
the
way
of
salvation
afterwards
and
when
i
can
testify
to
her
having
forsaken
the
errors
of
her
ways
and
that
i
have
made
her
a
light
to
lighten
the
gentiles
i
suppose
you
wo
object
then
to
her
coming
in
for
a
share
of
her
mother
inheritance
that
would
certainly
make
a
difference
but
i
wo
disguise
from
you
cousin
that
i
consider
this
young
person
as
a
hopeless
case
she
was
foredoomed
from
the
beginning
of
the
world
i
see
the
mark
upon
her
however
that
might
not
perhaps
make
such
difference
in
your
determination
for
i
know
you
to
be
a
man
very
steadfast
in
hope
cousin
stephen
but
there
is
moreover
i
think
another
obstacle
you
must
not
take
my
frankness
amiss
but
i
have
an
inward
misgiving
as
to
her
being
willing
to
accept
you
as
the
young
lady
is
a
minor
cousin
william
i
should
count
upon
its
being
in
your
power
to
make
her
marry
pretty
well
whom
you
please
and
this
you
may
rely
upon
that
in
case
you
favour
me
heartily
in
this
matter
there
is
no
work
of
any
kind
that
you
could
put
me
to
that
i
should
not
think
it
my
bounden
duty
to
perform
you
speak
like
a
just
and
conscientious
man
cousin
corbold
and
by
the
blessing
of
heaven
upon
us
i
trust
that
we
shall
be
so
able
to
work
together
for
righteousness
sake
that
in
the
end
we
may
compass
that
which
we
desire
nevertheless
i
confess
that
it
is
still
borne
in
upon
me
that
the
fair
and
excellent
widow
simpson
would
be
the
wisest
choice
for
you
should
it
please
providence
that
such
should
be
my
own
opinion
hereafter
cousin
cartwright
i
will
not
fail
to
make
it
known
unto
you
i
will
rest
my
faith
on
your
wisdom
therein
replied
the
vicar
but
it
is
now
time
that
i
should
go
to
speak
the
blessing
of
a
minister
and
the
welcome
of
a
friend
to
the
excellent
lady
at
the
park
and
remember
two
things
cousin
stephen
the
first
is
never
to
remain
in
the
room
with
the
widow
mowbray
and
myself
when
no
other
persons
are
present
and
the
next
is
in
importance
like
unto
it
remember
that
the
lady
is
even
yet
new
in
widowhood
and
that
any
imprudent
and
premature
allusion
to
my
possibly
taking
her
in
marriage
might
ruin
all
there
are
those
near
her
cousin
stephen
who
i
question
not
will
fight
against
me
the
attorney
promised
to
be
awake
and
watchful
and
never
to
permit
his
tongue
to
betray
the
counsels
of
his
heart
the
cousins
and
friends
who
notwithstanding
the
difference
of
their
callings
considered
themselves
as
corbold
observed
in
the
vineyard
then
walked
forth
together
towards
mowbray
park
well
pleased
with
themselves
and
all
things
around
them
at
the
present
and
with
pious
confidence
in
the
reward
of
their
labours
for
the
future
chapter
viii
charles
mrs
simpson
in
her
new
the
proceedings
discussed
the
two
gentlemen
found
the
family
at
the
park
very
sociably
seated
round
a
late
breakfast
table
helen
rosalind
and
charles
before
they
broke
up
their
conclave
in
the
library
the
night
before
or
rather
that
morning
had
all
decided
that
in
the
present
thorny
and
difficult
position
of
affairs
it
was
equally
their
duty
and
interest
to
propitiate
the
kind
feelings
of
mowbray
by
every
means
in
their
power
and
draw
her
thereby
if
possible
from
the
mischievous
and
insidious
influence
of
her
new
associates
it
is
hardly
possible
to
believe
said
charles
that
my
mother
can
really
prefer
the
society
of
such
an
animal
as
this
methodistical
attorney
to
that
of
her
own
family
or
of
those
neighbours
and
friends
from
whom
since
my
father
death
she
has
so
completely
withdrawn
herself
it
is
very
natural
she
should
be
out
of
spirits
poor
dear
soul
and
cartwright
is
just
the
sort
of
person
to
obtain
influence
at
such
a
time
but
i
trust
this
will
wear
off
again
she
will
soon
get
sick
of
the
solemn
attorney
and
we
shall
all
be
as
happy
again
as
ever
heaven
grant
it
said
helen
with
a
sigh
heaven
grant
it
echoed
rosalind
with
another
it
was
in
consequence
of
this
resolution
that
the
trio
continued
to
sit
at
the
table
much
longer
than
usual
exerting
themselves
to
amuse
mowbray
to
win
from
fanny
one
of
her
former
bright
smiles
and
even
to
make
miss
cartwright
sociable
their
efforts
were
not
wholly
unsuccessful
there
was
a
genuine
animation
and
vivacity
about
charles
that
seemed
irresistible
mowbray
looked
at
him
with
a
mother
eye
miss
cartwright
forsook
her
monosyllables
and
almost
conversed
and
fanny
while
listening
first
to
helen
and
then
to
her
brother
forgot
her
duty
as
a
professing
christian
as
far
as
to
let
a
whole
ringlet
of
her
sunny
hair
get
loose
from
behind
her
ear
and
not
notice
it
in
the
midst
of
this
gleam
of
sunshine
the
door
opened
and
cartwright
and
corbold
were
announced
ambitions
of
producing
effect
as
both
these
serious
gentlemen
certainly
were
they
could
hardly
have
hoped
when
their
spirits
were
most
exalted
within
them
to
have
caused
a
more
remarkable
revolution
in
the
state
of
things
than
their
appearance
now
produced
mowbray
coloured
half
rose
from
her
chair
sat
down
again
and
finally
exclaimed
oh
mr
cartwright
in
a
tone
of
voice
that
manifested
almost
every
feeling
he
could
wish
to
inspire
fanny
who
was
in
the
very
act
of
smiling
when
the
door
opened
immediately
became
conscious
that
her
hair
was
out
of
order
and
that
her
whole
attitude
and
manner
were
wanting
in
that
christian
grace
and
sobriety
which
had
been
of
late
her
chiefest
glory
such
christian
grace
and
sobriety
however
as
she
had
lately
learned
poor
child
are
not
difficult
to
assume
or
long
in
putting
on
so
that
before
her
minister
had
completed
his
little
prayer
and
thanksgiving
in
the
ear
of
her
mother
for
her
eternal
happiness
and
her
safe
return
fanny
was
quite
in
proper
trim
to
meet
his
eye
and
receive
his
blessing
henrietta
at
once
fell
back
into
her
wonted
heavy
silent
gloom
like
a
leaden
statue
upon
which
the
sun
shining
for
a
moment
had
thrown
the
hue
of
silver
charles
stood
up
and
saluted
the
vicar
civilly
but
coldly
while
to
his
companion
low
bow
he
returned
a
slight
and
stiff
inclination
of
the
head
it
should
be
observed
that
during
the
few
days
which
intervened
between
the
arrival
of
charles
and
the
return
of
his
mother
the
vicar
had
greatly
relaxed
in
his
attentions
to
fanny
and
indeed
altogether
in
the
frequency
of
his
pastoral
visitations
at
the
park
he
had
explained
this
in
the
ear
of
his
pretty
proselyte
by
telling
her
that
he
was
much
engaged
in
pushing
forward
the
work
of
regeneration
in
his
parish
to
the
which
holy
labour
he
was
the
more
urgently
incited
by
perceiving
that
the
seed
was
not
thrown
upon
barren
ground
nor
indeed
was
this
statement
wholly
untrue
he
had
taken
advantage
of
the
leisure
which
the
present
posture
of
affairs
at
the
park
left
upon
his
hands
in
seeking
to
inflame
the
imaginations
of
as
many
of
his
parishioners
as
he
could
get
to
listen
to
him
among
the
females
he
had
been
particularly
successful
and
indeed
the
proportion
of
the
fair
sex
who
are
found
to
embrace
the
tenets
which
this
gentleman
and
his
sect
have
introduced
in
place
of
those
of
the
church
of
england
is
so
great
that
as
their
faith
is
an
exclusive
one
it
might
be
conjectured
that
the
chief
object
of
the
doctrine
was
to
act
as
a
against
that
of
mahomet
who
atrocious
tyrant
as
he
was
shut
the
gates
of
heaven
against
all
whatsoever
were
it
not
that
an
occasional
nest
of
may
here
and
there
be
found
sometimes
in
a
barrack
and
sometimes
in
a
cloistered
college
which
show
that
election
is
not
wholly
confined
to
the
fair
there
are
however
some
very
active
and
inquiring
persons
who
assert
that
upon
a
fair
and
accurate
survey
throughout
england
and
wales
ireland
scotland
and
the
town
of
no
greater
number
of
this
sect
can
be
found
of
the
masculine
gender
than
may
suffice
to
perform
the
duties
of
ministers
deputy
ministers
missionaries
assistant
missionaries
both
in
and
out
of
parliament
and
such
serious
footmen
coachmen
butchers
and
bakers
as
the
fair
inhabitants
of
the
calvinistic
heaven
require
to
perform
the
unfeminine
drudgery
of
earth
it
was
in
consequence
of
this
remission
in
the
vicar
labours
for
the
regeneration
of
fanny
that
charles
mowbray
still
treated
him
with
the
respect
due
to
the
clergyman
of
his
parish
rosalind
felt
it
quite
impossible
to
describe
to
him
all
she
had
seen
and
her
promise
to
henrietta
forbade
her
to
repeat
what
she
had
heard
so
that
young
mowbray
though
he
disapproved
of
the
puritanic
innovations
of
toilet
and
so
much
disliked
cartwright
extempore
preaching
as
to
have
decided
upon
attending
divine
service
at
oakley
church
for
the
future
to
avoid
hearing
what
he
considered
as
so
very
indecent
an
innovation
he
was
still
quite
unaware
of
rosalind
real
motives
for
recalling
him
though
extremely
well
inclined
to
think
her
right
in
having
done
so
miss
torrington
and
helen
left
the
room
very
soon
after
the
two
gentlemen
entered
it
henrietta
with
the
stealthy
step
of
a
cat
followed
them
and
young
mowbray
felt
strongly
tempted
to
do
the
like
but
was
prevented
not
so
much
by
politeness
perhaps
as
by
curiosity
to
ascertain
if
possible
the
terms
on
which
both
these
gentlemen
stood
with
his
mother
but
it
was
not
possible
as
long
as
he
remained
with
them
the
very
scanty
conversation
which
took
place
was
wholly
on
uninteresting
subjects
and
charles
at
length
left
the
room
from
feeling
that
it
was
not
his
mother
pleasure
to
talk
to
the
attorney
of
the
business
that
he
presumed
must
have
brought
him
there
as
long
as
he
remained
in
it
there
is
in
the
domestic
history
of
human
life
no
cause
productive
of
effects
so
terrible
as
the
habit
of
acting
according
to
the
impulse
or
the
convenience
of
the
moment
without
fully
considering
the
effect
what
we
are
doing
may
produce
on
others
mowbray
in
waiting
till
charles
left
the
room
before
she
spake
to
corbold
of
the
and
other
papers
which
she
was
to
put
into
his
hands
was
almost
wholly
actuated
by
the
consciousness
that
the
attorney
she
was
employing
though
a
serious
was
a
very
vulgar
man
she
knew
that
her
son
was
rather
fastidious
on
such
points
and
she
disliked
the
idea
that
a
man
whose
distinguished
piety
rendered
him
so
peculiarly
eligible
as
a
man
of
business
should
at
his
first
introduction
to
the
confidential
situation
she
intended
he
should
hold
lay
himself
open
to
the
ridicule
of
a
youth
who
she
sighed
to
think
was
as
yet
quite
incapable
of
appreciating
his
merit
in
any
way
if
any
secondary
motive
mixed
with
this
it
arose
from
the
averseness
she
felt
of
which
she
was
not
herself
above
half
conscious
that
any
one
should
hear
advice
given
by
cartwright
who
might
think
themselves
at
liberty
to
question
it
but
with
all
this
she
never
dreamed
of
the
pain
she
was
giving
to
charles
heart
she
dreamed
not
that
her
son
her
only
son
with
a
heart
as
warm
as
generous
as
devoted
in
its
filial
love
as
ever
beat
in
the
breast
of
a
man
felt
all
his
ardent
affection
for
her
his
proud
fond
wish
of
being
her
protector
her
aid
her
confidential
friend
now
checked
and
chilled
at
once
and
for
ever
this
consequence
of
her
cold
restrained
manner
in
his
presence
was
so
natural
in
fact
so
inevitable
that
had
she
turned
her
eyes
from
herself
and
her
own
little
unimportant
feelings
to
what
might
be
their
effect
upon
his
it
is
hardly
possible
that
she
could
have
avoided
catching
some
glimpse
of
the
danger
she
ran
and
much
after
misery
might
have
been
spared
as
it
was
she
felt
a
movement
of
unequivocal
satisfaction
when
he
departed
and
having
told
fanny
to
join
the
other
young
ladies
while
she
transacted
business
she
was
left
alone
with
the
two
gentlemen
and
in
a
few
minutes
afterwards
the
contents
of
her
late
husband
consisting
of
parchments
memoranda
and
deeds
almost
innumerable
overspread
the
large
table
as
well
as
every
sofa
and
chair
within
convenient
reach
the
two
serious
gentlemen
smiled
but
it
was
inwardly
their
eyes
ran
over
the
inscription
of
every
precious
packet
and
if
those
of
the
professional
man
caught
more
rapidly
at
a
glance
the
respective
importance
of
each
the
vicar
had
the
advantage
of
him
in
that
prophetic
feeling
of
their
future
importance
to
himself
which
rendered
the
present
hour
one
of
the
happiest
of
his
life
meanwhile
charles
sought
helen
and
her
friend
far
however
from
wishing
to
impart
to
them
the
painful
impression
he
had
received
his
principal
object
in
immediately
seeking
them
was
if
possible
to
forget
it
he
found
the
four
girls
together
in
the
conservatory
and
affecting
more
gaiety
than
he
felt
exclaimed
how
many
recruits
shall
i
get
among
you
to
join
me
in
a
walk
to
wrexhill
one
two
three
four
that
delightful
make
haste
bonnet
and
veil
yourselves
without
delay
and
if
we
skirt
round
the
plantations
to
the
lodge
we
shall
escape
being
broiled
for
the
lanes
are
always
shady
when
he
had
got
his
convoy
fairly
under
weigh
they
began
to
make
inquiries
as
to
what
he
was
going
to
do
at
wrexhill
i
will
tell
you
he
replied
if
you
will
promise
not
to
run
away
and
forsake
me
they
pledged
themselves
to
be
faithful
to
their
escort
and
he
then
informed
them
that
it
was
his
very
particular
wish
and
desire
to
pay
sundry
visits
to
the
of
wrexhill
it
is
treason
to
the
milliner
not
to
have
told
us
so
before
charles
said
helen
only
look
at
poor
fanny
little
without
even
a
bow
to
set
it
off
what
will
simpson
think
of
us
i
assure
you
helen
said
fanny
that
if
i
had
known
we
were
going
to
visit
all
the
fine
people
in
the
county
i
should
have
put
on
no
other
bonnet
and
as
for
simpson
i
believe
you
are
quite
mistaken
in
supposing
she
would
object
to
it
i
hope
she
has
seen
the
error
of
her
ways
as
well
as
i
have
charles
and
that
we
shall
never
more
see
her
dressed
like
a
heathenish
woman
as
she
used
to
do
oh
fanny
fanny
exclaimed
charles
laughing
how
long
will
this
spirit
vex
you
fortunately
however
for
the
harmony
of
the
excursion
none
of
the
party
appeared
at
this
moment
inclined
to
controversy
and
the
subject
dropped
instead
therefore
of
talking
of
different
modes
of
faith
and
of
the
bonnets
thereunto
belonging
the
conversation
turned
upon
the
peculiar
beauty
of
the
woodland
scenery
around
wrexhill
and
miss
cartwright
as
almost
a
stranger
was
applied
to
for
her
opinion
of
it
i
believe
i
am
a
very
indifferent
judge
of
scenery
she
replied
the
fact
is
i
never
see
it
do
you
not
see
it
now
said
rosalind
do
you
not
see
that
beautiful
stretch
of
common
with
its
tufts
of
holly
its
rich
groups
of
with
their
dark
heavy
drapery
of
leaves
relieved
by
the
light
and
wavy
gracefulness
of
the
delicate
and
silvery
birch
and
loveliest
of
all
do
you
not
see
that
stately
avenue
of
oaks
the
turf
under
them
green
in
eternal
shade
and
the
long
perspective
looking
like
the
nave
of
some
gigantic
church
rosalind
stood
still
as
she
spoke
and
henrietta
remained
beside
her
they
were
descending
the
bit
of
steep
road
which
passing
behind
the
church
and
the
vicarage
led
into
the
village
street
of
wrexhill
and
the
scene
described
by
miss
torrington
was
at
this
point
completely
given
to
their
view
henrietta
put
her
arm
within
that
of
rosalind
with
a
degree
of
familiarity
very
unusual
with
her
and
having
gazed
on
the
fair
expanse
before
her
for
several
minutes
she
replied
yes
rosalind
i
do
see
it
now
and
i
thank
you
for
making
it
visible
to
me
perhaps
in
future
when
i
may
perchance
be
thinking
of
you
i
may
see
it
again
rosalind
turned
to
seek
her
meaning
in
her
face
and
saw
that
her
dark
eyes
were
full
of
tears
this
was
so
unexpected
so
unprecedented
so
totally
unlike
any
feeling
she
had
ever
remarked
in
her
before
that
rosalind
was
deeply
touched
by
it
and
pressing
the
arm
that
rested
on
hers
she
said
dear
henrietta
why
are
you
so
averse
to
letting
one
understand
what
passes
in
your
heart
it
is
only
by
an
accidental
breath
which
now
and
then
lifts
the
veil
you
hang
before
it
that
one
can
even
find
out
you
have
any
heart
at
all
did
you
know
all
the
darkness
that
dwells
there
you
would
not
thank
me
for
showing
it
to
you
having
said
this
she
stepped
hastily
forward
and
drawing
on
rosalind
who
would
have
lingered
with
her
till
they
had
overtaken
the
others
they
all
turned
from
the
lane
into
the
village
street
together
they
had
not
proceeded
a
hundred
yards
before
they
were
met
by
a
dozen
rosy
and
riotous
children
returning
from
dinner
to
school
at
sight
of
the
mowbray
party
every
boy
uncapped
and
every
little
girl
made
her
best
courtesy
but
one
unlucky
wag
whose
eyes
unfortunately
fixed
themselves
on
fanny
being
struck
by
the
precision
of
her
little
bonnet
straight
hair
and
the
total
absence
of
frill
furbelow
or
any
other
indication
of
restrained
his
bounding
steps
for
a
moment
and
pursing
up
his
little
features
into
a
look
of
sanctity
exclaimed
amen
and
then
terrified
at
what
he
had
done
galloped
away
and
hid
himself
among
his
fellows
fanny
coloured
but
immediately
assumed
the
resigned
look
that
announceth
martyrdom
charles
laughed
though
he
turned
round
and
shook
his
switch
at
the
saucy
offender
helen
looked
vexed
rosalind
amused
and
henrietta
very
nearly
delighted
a
few
minutes
more
brought
them
to
the
door
of
simpson
their
inquiry
for
the
lady
was
answered
by
the
information
that
she
was
schooling
miss
but
if
they
would
be
pleased
to
walk
in
she
would
come
down
directly
they
accordingly
entered
the
where
they
were
kept
waiting
for
some
time
which
was
indeed
pretty
generally
the
fate
of
morning
visitors
to
simpson
the
interval
was
employed
as
the
collectors
of
albums
and
annuals
intend
all
intervals
should
be
namely
in
the
examination
of
all
the
volumes
deposited
on
the
grand
round
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
on
all
the
square
oblong
octagon
and
oval
minor
tables
in
the
various
nooks
and
corners
of
it
on
the
present
occasion
they
seemed
to
promise
more
amusement
than
usual
to
the
party
who
had
most
of
them
been
frequently
there
before
for
they
were
nearly
all
new
poor
little
fanny
though
she
knew
that
not
one
of
those
with
her
were
capable
of
enjoying
the
intellectual
and
edifying
feast
that
almost
the
first
glance
of
her
eye
showed
her
was
set
before
them
could
not
restrain
an
exclamation
of
oh
how
the
whole
collection
indeed
which
though
recently
and
hastily
formed
had
evidently
been
brought
together
by
the
hand
of
a
master
of
such
matters
was
not
only
most
strictly
evangelical
but
most
evangelically
ingenious
helen
however
appeared
to
find
food
neither
for
pleasantry
nor
edification
there
for
having
opened
one
or
two
slender
volumes
and
as
many
heavy
pamphlets
she
abandoned
the
occupation
with
a
sigh
that
spoke
sadness
and
vexation
miss
cartwright
who
had
seated
herself
on
the
same
sofa
finished
her
examination
still
more
quickly
saying
in
a
low
voice
as
she
settled
herself
in
a
corner
surfeit
is
the
father
of
much
fast
miss
torrington
and
young
mowbray
got
hold
of
by
far
the
finest
volume
of
all
whose
gilt
leaves
and
silken
linings
showed
that
it
was
intended
as
the
repository
of
the
most
precious
gifts
that
according
to
the
frontispiece
genius
could
offer
to
friendship
having
given
a
glance
at
its
contents
charles
drew
out
his
pencil
and
on
the
blank
side
of
a
letter
wrote
the
following
catalogue
of
them
which
though
imperfect
as
not
naming
them
all
was
most
scrupulously
correct

far
as
it

he
had
just
presented
the
scrap
to
rosalind
when
simpson
entered
leading
her
little
girl
in
her
hand
but
the
young
lady
had
leisure
to
convey
it
unnoticed
to
her
pocket
as
the
mistress
of
the
house
had
for
the
first
few
minutes
eyes
only
for
fanny
in
fact
she
literally
ran
to
her
the
instant
she
perceived
her
little
bonnet
and
folding
her
arms
round
her
exclaimed
my
dear
dear
child
my
dear
dear
sister
this
is
providential
it
is
a
blessing
i
shall
remember
alway
our
minister
told
me
that
i
should
read
at
a
glance
the
blessed
change
wrought
upon
you
i
do
read
it
and
i
will
rejoice
therefore
i
beg
your
pardon
ladies
mowbray
pray
sit
down
i
beg
your
pardon
i
rejoice
to
see
you
though
as
yet
her
eyes
fixed
themselves
on
the
bonnet
of
rosalind
which
besides
being
large
had
the
abomination
of
sundry
bows
not
to
mention
a
bunch
of
laburnum
blossoms
ah
my
dear
miss
helen
the
time
will
come
i
will
supplicate
that
it
may
when
you
too
like
your
precious
sister
shall
become
a
sign
and
example
to
all
men
how
the
seed
grows
my
sweet
miss
fanny
she
continued
turning
to
the
only
one
of
her
guests
whom
strictly
speaking
she
considered
it
right
to
converse
with
how
it
grows
and
spreads
under
the
dew
of
faith
and
the
sunshine
of
righteousness
it
is
just
three
months
three
little
blessed
months
since
the
beam
first
fell
upon
my
heart
miss
fanny
and
look
at
me
look
at
my
child
look
at
my
albums
look
at
my
books
look
at
my
look
at
my
missionary
box
on
one
side
and
my
london
society
box
on
the
other
is
not
this
a
ripening
and
preparing
for
the
harvest
miss
fanny
fanny
coloured
partly
perhaps
from
pride
and
pleasure
but
partly
certainly
from
shyness
at
being
so
distinguished
and
only
murmured
the
word
beautiful
in
reply
miss
mowbray
felt
equally
provoked
and
disgusted
but
while
inwardly
resolving
that
she
would
never
again
put
herself
in
the
way
of
witnessing
what
she
so
greatly
condemned
she
deemed
it
best
to
stay
if
possible
the
torrent
of
nonsense
which
was
thus
overwhelming
her
sister
by
giving
another
turn
to
the
conversation
have
you
seen
richards
lately
mrs
simpson
she
said
richards
and
i
very
rarely
meet
now
miss
mowbray
was
the
reply
the
three
young
ladies
indeed
i
am
happy
to
say
have
wholly
separated
themselves
from
their
mother
in
spirit
and
are
all
of
them
becoming
shining
lights
oh
miss
fanny
how
sweetly
pious
are
those
lines
written
between
you
and
little
mary
fanny
suddenly
became
as
red
as
scarlet
the
alternate
verses
i
mean
in
praise
and
glory
of
our
excellent
minister
he
brought
them
to
me
himself
and
we
read
them
together
and
we
almost
shed
tears
of
tender
blessing
on
you
both
dear
children
charles
who
thought
and
with
great
satisfaction
that
whatever
stuff
his
poor
little
sister
might
have
written
she
was
now
very
heartily
ashamed
of
it
wishing
to
relieve
her
from
the
embarrassment
which
nevertheless
he
rejoiced
to
see
rose
from
his
chair
and
approaching
a
window
said
what
a
very
pleasant
room
you
have
here
simpson
it
is
almost
due
east
is
it
not
if
the
room
over
it
be
your
apartment
i
should
think
the
sun
must
pay
you
too
early
a
visit
there
unless
your
windows
are
well
curtained
oh
mowbray
sunrise
is
such
a
time
of
praise
and
blessing
that
even
though
the
curtains
are
drawn
i
always
try
if
i
am
awake
to
think
how
heavenly
it
is
looking
outside
are
you
an
early
riser
mrs
simpson
said
helen
not
very
at
least
not
always
but
since
my
election
i
have
been
endeavouring
to
get
down
to
prayers
by
about
eight
it
is
so
delightful
to
think
how
many
people
are
coming
down
stairs
to
prayers
just
at
eight
your
little
girl
is
very
much
grown
simpson
said
miss
torrington
willing
to
try
another
opening
by
which
to
escape
from
under
the
heels
of
the
lady
hobby
but
it
did
not
answer
hold
up
your
head
mimima
dear
said
the
mamma
and
tell
these
ladies
what
you
have
been
learning
lately
she
is
still
rather
shy
but
it
is
going
off
i
hope
precious
child
she
is
grown
such
a
prayerful
thing
miss
fanny
you
ca
imagine
mimima
why
did
you
not
eat
up
all
your
yesterday
tell
miss
fanny
mowbray
because
it
is
wicked
to
love
answered
the
child
folding
her
little
hands
one
over
the
other
upon
the
bosom
of
her
plain
frock
no
longer
protruding
in
all
directions
its
sumptuous
of
lace
and
embroidery
darling
angel
and
why
my
precious
is
it
wicked
because
it
is
a
sin
to
care
for
our
vile
bodies
and
because
we
ought
to
love
nothing
but
the
lord
is
not
that
a
blessing
said
simpson
again
turning
to
fanny
and
how
can
i
be
grateful
enough
to
the
angelic
man
who
has
put
me
and
my
little
one
in
the
right
way
it
was
really
generous
in
good
simpson
to
give
all
the
praise
due
for
the
instruction
and
religious
awakening
of
her
little
girl
to
the
vicar
for
it
was
in
truth
entirely
her
own
work
as
it
generally
happened
that
when
cartwright
paid
her
a
visit
fearing
probably
that
the
movements
of
a
child
might
disturb
his
nerves
she
dismissed
her
little
mimima
to
her
nursery
one
or
two
more
attempts
on
the
part
of
helen
to
bring
the
conversation
to
a
tone
that
she
should
consider
as
more
befitting
the
neighbourly
of
a
morning
visit
and
in
plain
english
less
tinctured
with
blasphemy
having
been
made
and
failed
she
rose
and
took
her
leave
the
rest
of
her
party
following
but
not
without
fanny
receiving
another
embrace
and
this
fervent
farewell
uttered
in
her
ear
the
saints
and
angels
bless
and
keep
you
dear
sister
after
quitting
the
house
of
this
regenerated
lady
the
party
proposed
to
make
a
visit
to
that
of
richards
but
miss
cartwright
expressed
a
wish
to
go
to
the
vicarage
instead
and
begged
they
would
call
at
the
door
for
her
as
they
passed
miss
torrington
offered
to
accompany
her
but
this
was
declined
though
not
quite
in
her
usual
cynical
manner
upon
such
occasions
and
could
rosalind
have
followed
her
with
her
eye
up
the
vicarage
hill
she
would
have
seen
that
she
stopped
and
turned
to
look
down
upon
the
common
and
its
trees
just
at
the
spot
where
they
had
stood
together
before
on
entering
richards
pretty
little
saloon
they
were
startled
and
somewhat
embarrassed
at
finding
that
lady
in
tears
and
major
dalrymple
walking
about
the
room
with
very
evident
symptoms
of
discomposure
helen
who
like
every
body
else
in
the
neighbourhood
was
perfectly
aware
of
the
major
unrequited
attachment
or
at
any
rate
his
unsuccessful
suit
really
thought
that
the
present
moment
was
probably
intended
by
him
to
decide
his
fate
for
ever
and
felt
exceedingly
distressed
at
having
intruded
though
doubtful
whether
to
retreat
now
would
not
make
matters
worse
those
who
followed
her
shared
both
her
fears
and
her
doubts
but
not
so
the
widow
and
the
major
who
both
after
the
interval
of
a
moment
during
which
richards
wiped
her
eyes
and
major
dalrymple
recovered
his
composure
declared
with
very
evident
sincerity
that
they
were
heartily
glad
to
see
them
we
are
in
the
midst
of
a
dispute
mowbray
said
the
major
addressing
charles
and
i
will
bet
a
thousand
to
one
that
you
will
be
on
my
side
whatever
the
ladies
may
be
shall
i
refer
the
question
to
charles
mowbray
mrs
richards
oh
yes
i
shall
like
to
have
it
referred
to
the
whole
party
she
replied
well
then
this
it
is
i
need
not
tell
you
good
people
that
the
present
vicar
of
wrexhill
is
but
he
exclaimed
suddenly
stopping
himself
and
fixing
his
eyes
on
fanny
i
am
terribly
afraid
by
the
trim
cut
of
that
little
bonnet
that
there
one
amongst
us
that
will
be
taking
notes
is
it
so
miss
fanny
are
you
as
completely
over
head
and
ears
in
love
with
the
vicar
as
your
friend
little
mary
and
for
that
matter
louisa
charlotte
simpson
miss
mimima
simpson
dame
rogers
the
miller
wife
betsey
the
tailor
daughter
molly
tomkins
sally
finden
jenny
curtis
susan
smith
and
about
threescore
and
ten
more
of
our
parish
have
all
put
on
the
armour
of
righteousness
being
buckled
belted
and
spurred
by
the
vicar
himself
are
you
really
and
truly
become
one
of
his
babes
of
grace
fanny
if
it
is
your
intention
to
say
any
thing
disrespectful
of
cartwright
replied
fanny
i
had
much
rather
not
hear
it
i
will
go
and
look
at
your
roses
richards
and
as
richards
did
not
wish
her
to
remain
she
quietly
opened
the
which
led
into
the
garden
let
her
pass
through
it
and
then
closed
it
after
her
pretty
creature
exclaimed
major
dalrymple
what
a
pity
it
will
not
last
major
said
charles
he
has
scared
her
conscience
which
is
actually
too
pure
and
innocent
to
know
the
sound
of
its
own
voice
and
then
he
seized
upon
her
fanciful
and
poetic
imagination
and
set
it
in
arms
against
her
silly
self
till
she
really
seems
to
see
the
seven
mortal
sins
turn
which
way
she
will
and
i
am
sure
she
would
stand
for
seven
years
together
on
one
leg
like
an
hindoo
to
avoid
them
she
is
a
dear
good
little
soul
and
she
will
get
the
better
of
all
this
trash
depend
upon
it
i
trust
she
will
mowbray
but
tell
me
while
the
mischief
is
still
at
work
shall
you
not
think
it
right
to
banish
the
causer
of
it
from
your
house
for
you
must
know
this
brings
us
exactly
to
the
point
at
issue
between
richards
and
me
she
is
breaking
her
heart
because
her
three
girls
ay
little
mary
and
all
have
been
bit
by
this
black
tarantula
and
because
she
thank
heaven
has
escaped
her
daughters
have
thought
proper
to
raise
the
standard
of
rebellion
and
to
tell
her
very
coolly
upon
all
occasions
that
she
is
doomed
to
everlasting
perdition
and
that
their
only
chance
of
escape
is
never
more
to
give
obedience
or
even
attention
to
any
word
she
can
utter
the
major
stopped
overcome
by
his
own
vehemence
and
charles
would
have
fancied
that
he
saw
tears
in
his
eyes
if
he
had
dared
to
look
at
him
for
another
moment
rosalind
who
had
more
love
and
liking
for
richards
than
is
usually
the
growth
of
six
months
acquaintance
had
placed
herself
close
beside
her
and
taken
her
hand
but
when
major
dalrymple
ceased
speaking
she
rose
up
and
with
a
degree
of
energy
that
probably
surprised
all
her
hearers
but
most
especially
charles
and
helen
she
said
if
major
dalrymple
you
should
be
the
first
in
this
unfortunate
parish
of
wrexhill
to
raise
your
voice
against
this
invader
of
the
station
rights
and
duties
of
a
set
of
men
in
whose
avocations
he
has
neither
part
nor
lot
you
will
deserve
more
honour
than
even
the
field
of
waterloo
could
give
you
yes
turn
him
from
your
house
dear
friend
as
you
would
one
who
brought
poison
to
you
in
the
guise
of
wholesome
food
or
healing
medicine
let
him
never
enter
your
doors
again
let
him
preach
if
preach
he
must
in
a
church
as
empty
as
his
own
pretensions
to
holiness
and
if
proper
authority
should
at
length
be
awaked
to
chase
him
from
a
pulpit
that
belongs
of
right
to
a
true
and
real
member
of
the
english
church
then
let
him
buy
a
sixpenny
licence
if
he
can
get
it
to
preach
in
a
tub
the
only
fitting
theatre
for
his
doctrines
bravo
cried
the
major
in
a
perfect
ecstasy
do
you
hear
her
richards
charles
mowbray
do
you
hear
her
and
will
either
of
you
ever
suffer
cartwright
to
enter
your
doors
again
i
believe
in
my
heart
that
she
is
quite
right
said
charles
the
idiot
folly
i
have
witnessed
at
simpson
this
morning
and
the
much
more
grievous
effects
which
his
ministry
as
he
calls
it
has
produced
here
have
quite
convinced
me
that
such
is
no
jesting
matter
but
i
have
no
doors
dalrymple
to
shut
against
him
all
i
can
do
is
to
endeavour
to
open
my
mother
eyes
to
the
mischief
he
is
doing
helen
sighed
and
shook
her
head
is
then
your
good
mother
too
far
gone
in
this
maudlin
delirium
to
listen
to
him
said
the
major
in
an
accent
of
deep
concern
indeed
major
i
fear
so
replied
helen
i
told
you
so
major
dalrymple
said
richards
i
told
you
that
in
such
a
line
of
conduct
as
you
advise
i
should
be
supported
by
no
one
of
any
consequence
and
i
really
do
not
feel
courage
to
stand
alone
in
it
and
it
is
that
very
want
of
courage
that
i
deplore
more
than
all
the
rest
replied
the
major
you
that
have
done
and
suffered
so
much
with
all
the
quiet
courage
of
a
real
heroine
that
you
should
now
sink
before
such
an
enemy
as
this
is
what
i
really
can
not
see
with
patience
and
whence
comes
this
cowardice
my
dear
mrs
richards
said
rosalind
i
will
tell
you
miss
torrington
replied
the
widow
her
voice
trembling
with
emotion
as
she
spoke
i
will
tell
you
all
the
courage
of
which
i
have
ever
given
proof
has
been
inspired
strengthened
and
set
in
action
by
my
children
by
my
love
for
them
and
their
love
for
me
this
is
over
i
have
lost
their
love
i
have
lost
their
confidence
they
look
upon
me
even
my
mary
who
once
shared
every
feeling
of
my
heart
they
all
look
upon
me
as
one
accursed
separated
from
them
through
all
eternity
and
doomed
by
a
decree
of
my
maker
decided
on
thousands
of
years
before
i
was
born
to
live
for
countless
ages
in
torments
unspeakable
they
repeat
all
this
and
hug
the
faith
that
teaches
it
is
not
this
enough
to
sap
the
courage
of
the
stoutest
heart
that
ever
woman
boasted
it
is
dreadful
cried
helen
oh
most
dreadful
such
then
will
be
and
already
are
the
feelings
of
my
mother
respecting
me
respecting
charles
yet
how
she
loved
us
a
few
short
months
ago
how
dearly
she
loved
us
both
come
come
miss
mowbray
i
did
not
mean
to
pain
you
in
this
manner
said
the
major
do
not
fancy
things
worse
than
they
really
are
depend
upon
it
your
brother
will
take
care
to
prevent
this
man
impious
profanation
of
religion
from
doing
such
mischief
at
mowbray
as
it
has
done
here
had
there
been
any
master
of
the
house
at
meadow
cottage
this
gentleman
so
miscalled
would
never
never
never
have
got
a
footing
there
then
i
heartily
wish
there
were
said
charles
if
only
for
the
sake
of
setting
a
good
example
to
the
parish
in
general
but
for
the
park
in
particular
it
is
as
masterless
as
the
cottage
i
believe
said
richards
that
amongst
you
i
shall
gain
courage
to
be
mistress
here
and
this
if
effectually
done
may
answer
as
well
you
really
advise
me
then
all
of
you
to
forbid
the
clergyman
of
the
parish
from
entering
my
doors
yes
replied
the
major
firmly
and
he
was
echoed
zealously
by
the
rest
of
the
party
so
be
it
then
said
richards
but
i
would
my
enemy
for
such
indeed
he
is
held
any
other
station
among
us
i
could
shut
my
doors
against
all
the
lords
and
ladies
in
the
country
with
less
pain
than
against
the
clergyman
i
can
fully
enter
into
that
feeling
said
helen
but
surely
in
proportion
as
the
station
is
venerable
the
abuse
of
it
is
unpardonable
let
this
strengthen
your
resolution
and
your
children
will
recover
their
wits
again
depend
upon
it
i
would
the
same
remedy
could
be
applied
with
us
but
you
are
so
much
respected
my
dear
richards
that
i
am
not
without
hope
from
your
example
adieu
we
shall
be
anxious
to
hear
how
you
go
on
and
you
must
not
fail
to
let
us
see
you
soon
the
mowbray
party
having
recalled
the
fanny
then
took
leave
not
without
the
satisfaction
of
believing
that
their
visit
had
been
and
useful
chapter
ix
discussion
on
mr
corbold
installed
having
called
at
the
vicarage
for
miss
cartwright
they
proceeded
homeward
along
the
pleasant
paths
they
had
so
often
trod
with
gaiety
but
now
there
was
a
look
of
care
and
anxious
thoughtfulness
on
each
young
brow
that
seemed
to
say
their
happiness
was
blighted
by
the
fear
of
sorrow
to
come
though
not
at
all
able
to
understand
henrietta
and
not
above
half
liking
her
there
was
yet
more
feeling
of
intimacy
between
miss
torrington
and
her
than
had
been
attained
by
any
other
of
the
family
it
was
she
therefore
who
after
preceding
the
others
by
a
few
rapid
steps
up
the
hill
rang
the
bell
of
the
vicarage
and
waited
in
the
porch
for
miss
cartwright
during
these
few
moments
the
trio
had
passed
on
and
miss
torrington
finding
herself
with
the
vicar
daughter
ventured
to
relate
to
her
pretty
nearly
all
that
occurred
at
the
house
of
richards
by
no
means
omitting
the
resolution
that
lady
had
come
to
respecting
cartwright
i
am
very
sorry
for
it
said
henrietta
you
regret
the
loss
of
their
society
then
for
your
sake
henrietta
i
am
sorry
too
for
my
sake
regret
the
loss
of
their
society
are
you
not
mocking
me
you
know
i
am
not
replied
rosalind
in
a
tone
of
vexation
why
should
you
not
regret
the
loss
of
richards
society
only
because
there
is
no
society
in
the
world
that
i
could
either
wish
for
or
regret
it
is
hardly
fair
in
you
miss
cartwright
said
rosalind
to
excite
my
interest
so
often
as
you
do
and
yet
to
leave
it
for
ever
pining
for
want
of
a
more
full
and
generous
confidence
i
have
no
such
feeling
as
generosity
in
me
and
as
to
exciting
your
interest
i
do
assure
you
it
is
quite
involuntarily
and
indeed
i
should
think
that
no
human
being
could
be
less
likely
to
trouble
their
fellow
creatures
in
that
way
than
myself
but
is
there
not
at
least
a
little
wilfulness
henrietta
in
the
manner
in
which
from
time
to
time
you
throw
out
a
bait
to
my
curiosity
it
is
weakness
not
wilfulness
rosalind
i
am
ashamed
to
confess
even
to
myself
that
there
are
moments
when
i
fancy
i
should
like
to
love
you
and
then
i
would
give
more
than
my
worthless
life
if
i
had
it
that
you
should
love
me
when
this
contemptible
folly
seizes
me
i
may
perhaps
as
you
say
throw
out
a
bait
to
catch
your
curiosity
and
then
it
is
i
utter
the
words
of
which
you
complain
but
you
must
allow
that
this
childishness
never
holds
me
long
and
that
the
moment
it
is
past
i
become
as
reasonable
and
as
wretched
again
as
ever
will
you
tell
me
whether
this
feeling
of
profound
contempt
for
yourself
whenever
you
are
conscious
of
a
kindly
sentiment
towards
me
arises
from
your
conviction
of
my
individual
despicability
or
from
believing
that
all
human
affections
are
degrading
not
exactly
from
either
as
for
you
rosalind
is
it
not
the
weak
and
wavering
hamlet
who
says
in
one
of
those
flashes
of
fine
philosophy
that
burst
athwart
the
gloom
of
his
poor
troubled
spirit
me
that
man
that
is
not
passion
slave
my
wits
are
often
as
much
diseased
as
his
i
believe
but
i
too
have
my
intervals
and
when
the
moon
is
not
at
the
full
i
sometimes
sketch
the
portrait
of
a
being
that
one
might
venture
to
love
i
however
have
no
quarrel
against
passion
it
is
not
from
thence
my
sorrows
have
come
but
i
would
say
me
that
friend
that
is
not
slave
and
i
will
wear
him
or
her
rosalind
in
my
heart
core
ay
in
my
heart
of
heart
and
if
after
all
my
hard
schooling
i
could
be
simple
enough
to
believe
that
any
thing
in
human
form
could
be
true
i
should
be
more
likely
to
commit
the
folly
about
you
than
about
any
one
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
but
still
you
believe
me
false
i
do
and
why
henrietta
because
you
are
a
woman
no
no
because
you
are
a
human
being
and
you
really
without
meaning
to
season
your
speech
with
pungent
crystals
of
satire
you
really
do
not
believe
that
truth
can
be
found
in
any
human
being
i
really
do
not
heaven
help
you
then
i
would
rather
pass
my
life
in
a
roofless
cabin
and
feed
on
than
live
in
such
a
persuasion
and
so
would
i
rosalind
then
why
do
you
nourish
such
hateful
theories
i
shall
begin
to
think
your
jesting
words
too
true
henrietta
and
believe
indeed
that
your
wits
are
not
quite
healthy
would
i
could
believe
it
i
would
submit
to
a
and
a
shaven
crown
if
i
could
but
persuade
myself
that
i
was
mad
and
that
all
that
i
have
fancied
going
on
around
me
were
but
so
many
vapours
from
a
brain
and
so
they
have
been
if
you
construe
every
word
you
hear
and
every
act
you
see
into
falsehood
and
delusion
rosalind
rosalind
how
can
i
do
otherwise
come
come
enough
of
this
do
not
force
me
against
my
will
against
my
resolution
to
tell
you
what
has
brought
me
to
the
wretched
hopeless
state
of
apathy
in
which
you
found
me
were
i
to
do
this
you
would
only
have
to
follow
the
weakness
of
your
nature
and
believe
in
order
to
become
as
moody
and
as
miserable
as
myself
but
you
do
not
mean
to
tell
me
that
i
should
be
proving
my
weakness
in
believing
indeed
i
do
you
surely
can
not
be
altogether
so
credulous
as
to
suppose
that
all
you
see
in
me
is
true
sincere
candid
open
honest
are
you
honest
now
in
telling
me
that
you
are
false
why
partly
yes
and
partly
no
rosalind
and
it
is
just
such
a
question
as
that
which
sets
one
upon
discovering
how
contrary
to
our
very
essence
it
is
to
be
purely
and
altogether
true
but
were
i
one
of
those
who
fancy
that
pincushions
are
often
made
by
the
merciful
decrees
of
an
providence
i
should
say
that
we
were
ordained
to
be
false
in
order
to
prevent
our
being
straightforward
undisguised
demons
why
i
look
you
who
sit
netting
a
purse
that
i
hope
will
never
be
finished
as
diligently
as
if
my
life
would
be
saved
by
completing
the
last
stitch
by
a
given
time
and
as
quietly
as
if
i
had
no
nails
upon
my
fingers
and
no
pointed
scissors
in
my
even
i
all
harmless
as
i
seem
would
be
likely
were
it
not
for
my
consummate
hypocrisy
to
be
stabbing
and
scratching
half
a
dozen
times
a
day
and
were
you
freed
from
this
restraint
would
your
maiming
propensities
betray
themselves
promiscuously
or
be
confined
to
one
or
more
particular
objects
not
quite
promiscuously
i
think
but
hypocrisy
apart
for
a
moment
do
you
not
perceive
that
charles
mowbray
has
been
looking
round
at
us
at
both
of
us
observe
about
once
in
every
second
minute
do
you
know
that
i
think
he
would
like
us
both
of
us
observe
to
walk
on
and
join
the
party
well
then
let
us
do
so
said
rosalind
as
they
drew
near
the
house
they
perceived
stephen
corbold
wandering
round
it
his
hands
behind
his
back
and
under
his
coat
and
his
eyes
now
raised
to
the
stately
portico
now
lowered
to
the
long
range
of
windows
belonging
to
the
conservatory
at
one
moment
sent
afield
over
the
spacious
park
and
in
the
next
brought
back
again
to
contemplate
anew
the
noble
mansion
to
which
it
belonged
during
one
of
the
wanderings
of
those
speculating
orbs
he
spied
the
advancing
party
and
immediately
settling
himself
in
his
attire
and
assuming
the
more
graceful
attitude
obtained
by
thrusting
a
hand
in
each
of
his
nether
garments
he
resolutely
walked
forward
to
meet
them
fanny
his
friends
and
kinsfolk
being
ever
in
her
memory
made
an
effort
which
seemed
to
combat
instinct
and
put
out
her
little
hand
to
welcome
him
but
before
he
was
fully
aware
of
the
honour
for
indeed
his
eyes
were
fixed
upon
her
elder
sister
she
coloured
and
withdrew
it
again
satisfying
her
hospitable
feelings
by
pronouncing
simply
his
name
but
with
a
sort
of
indistinctness
in
the
accent
which
seemed
to
signify
that
something
more
had
either
preceded
or
followed
it
this
word
the
only
one
which
greeted
him
brought
him
instantly
to
her
side
and
even
gave
him
the
prodigious
audacity
to
offer
his
arm
which
however
she
did
not
accept
for
at
that
moment
the
hook
of
her
parasol
became
entangled
in
the
fringe
of
her
shawl
and
it
seemed
to
require
vast
patience
and
perseverance
to
extricate
it
still
notwithstanding
this
little
disappointment
he
kept
close
to
her
side
for
helen
leaned
upon
the
arm
of
her
brother
and
though
still
persuaded
that
by
the
aid
of
his
reverend
cousin
he
should
be
able
to
obtain
her
and
pretty
nearly
every
thing
else
he
wished
for
he
had
no
particular
inclination
to
renew
the
courtship
he
had
begun
on
the
journey
in
the
presence
of
charles
fanny
therefore
and
her
attendant
entered
the
house
together
while
the
rest
wheeled
off
in
order
to
avail
themselves
of
a
postern
entrance
by
which
the
ladies
might
reach
their
rooms
without
any
risk
of
again
encountering
corbold
who
by
a
sort
of
tacit
consent
seemed
equally
avoided
by
all
the
survey
which
this
person
was
taking
of
the
premises
when
the
walking
party
returned
was
neither
the
first
second
third
nor
fourth
which
he
had
had
the
opportunity
of
making
since
their
setting
out
for
in
obedience
to
cartwright
hint
he
had
no
sooner
received
from
mowbray
under
the
instructions
from
that
reverend
person
the
orders
necessary
for
the
new
arrangements
about
to
be
made
than
he
retired
the
vicar
remaining
with
the
widow
and
the
keys
of
her
which
perhaps
he
had
reason
for
thinking
would
be
as
safe
anywhere
else
as
in
his
cousin
stephen
pocket
the
which
followed
the
attorney
departure
was
long
interesting
and
very
confidential
on
the
part
of
the
gentleman
great
skill
was
displayed
by
the
manner
in
which
the
following
subjects
were
made
to
mix
and
mingle
together
till
like
to
a
skilfully
composed
ragout
no
flavour
of
any
kind
was
left
distinctly
perceptible
but
the
effect
of
the
whole
was
just
what
the
artist
intended
it
should
be
the
subjects
leading
to
and
composing
this
general
effect
were
first
the
deep
interest
raised
in
the
breast
of
every
good
man
by
the
sight
of
a
gentle
and
woman
in
want
of
assistance
to
carry
her
through
the
wearying
and
unspiritual
cares
incident
to
our
passage
through
this
world
of
sin
secondly
the
exceeding
of
mercy
to
be
traced
in
such
dispensations
as
led
the
unawakened
to
look
for
such
aid
and
assistance
from
those
who
have
been
called
and
elected
thirdly
the
blessed
assurance
of
everlasting
joy
that
never
failed
to
visit
those
who
left
husband
or
child
for
the
lord
sake
fourthly
the
unerring
wisdom
of
providence
in
the
placing
the
tender
consciences
of
the
in
the
keeping
of
those
who
best
know
how
to
lead
them
aright
fifthly
the
damnable
and
wickedness
of
struggling
against
heaven
for
the
sake
of
any
worldly
feelings
or
affections
whatever
and
sixthly
the
saving
merit
surpassing
all
the
works
that
our
sinful
nature
could
ever
permit
us
to
perform
which
is
found
in
such
as
cling
to
the
spoken
word
and
who
hold
fast
to
the
persecuted
and
oppressed
who
preach
it
on
these
themes
blended
and
harmonised
together
so
as
completely
to
mystify
the
mind
of
the
weak
and
nervous
mowbray
and
accompanied
with
just
so
much
gentle
demonstration
of
affectionate
tenderness
as
might
soften
without
alarming
her
did
the
vicar
of
wrexhill
discourse
for
the
three
hours
that
they
were
left
alone
it
would
lead
my
narrative
into
too
great
length
were
every
step
recorded
by
which
all
mowbray
other
feelings
were
made
to
merge
in
the
one
overwhelming
influence
of
calvinistic
terror
on
one
side
and
calvinistic
pride
at
presumed
election
on
the
other
the
wily
vicar
contrived
in
the
course
of
a
few
months
so
completely
to
rule
the
heart
and
head
of
this
poor
lady
that
she
looked
upon
her
son
charles
as
a
reprobate
who
unless
speedily
changed
in
spirit
by
severe
discipline
and
the
constant
prayers
of
cartwright
must
inevitably
pass
from
this
mortal
life
to
a
state
of
endless
torture
in
the
life
to
come
for
helen
she
was
bade
to
hope
that
the
time
of
election
after
much
wrestling
would
come
in
fanny
she
was
told
to
glory
and
rejoice
and
for
miss
torrington
quietly
to
wait
the
appointed
time
till
heaven
should
make
its
voice
heard
when
it
would
be
borne
in
upon
his
mind
or
upon
that
of
some
one
of
the
elect
whether
she
must
be
given
over
to
eternal
destruction
or
saved
with
the
remnant
of
the
true
flock
which
he
and
his
brother
shepherds
were
bringing
together
into
one
fold
but
with
all
this
though
eternally
talking
of
mystical
and
heavenly
love
which
was
ever
blended
with
insidious
demonstrations
of
holy
brotherly
and
christian
tenderness
cartwright
had
never
yet
spoken
to
the
widow
mowbray
of
marriage
she
had
been
six
months
a
widow
and
her
deep
mourning
weeds
were
exchanged
for
a
dress
elegantly
becoming
but
still
marking
her
as
belonging
to
what
cartwright
constantly
called
in
the
midst
of
all
his
prosperous
intrigues
the
persecuted
church
stephen
corbold
was
comfortably
settled
in
a
snug
little
mansion
in
the
village
and
though
he
had
never
yet
got
hold
of
the
he
had
begun
to
receive
the
rents
of
the
mowbray
estates
he
too
was
waiting
the
appointed
time
namely
the
installing
of
his
cousin
at
the
park
for
the
fruition
of
all
his
hopes
in
the
possession
of
helen
and
in
such
a
fortune
with
her
as
his
report
of
her
progress
towards
regeneration
might
entitle
her
to
richards
had
been
refused
bread
by
a
converted
baker
beer
by
an
elected
brewer
and
soap
and
candles
by
that
pious
prayerful
servant
of
the
lord
richard
white
the
her
daughters
however
still
held
fast
to
the
faith
though
their
poor
mother
grew
thinner
and
paler
every
day
and
continued
to
meet
the
vicar
sometimes
in
the
highways
sometimes
in
the
byways
and
sometimes
in
the
exemplary
simpson
colonel
harrington
had
returned
to
his
regiment
without
ever
again
seeing
helen
who
had
been
forbidden
with
such
awful
denunciations
in
case
of
disobedience
from
ever
holding
any
intercourse
direct
or
indirect
with
the
family
at
oakley
that
though
she
pined
in
thought
she
obeyed
and
was
daily
denounced
by
sir
gilbert
and
his
lady
though
happily
she
knew
it
not
as
the
most
ungrateful
and
heartless
of
girls
fanny
was
growing
tall
thin
and
miserable
for
having
a
sort
of
stubborn
feeling
within
her
which
resisted
the
assurances
she
almost
hourly
received
of
having
been
elected
to
eternal
grace
she
was
secretly
torturing
her
distempered
conscience
with
the
belief
that
she
was
deluding
every
one
but
her
creator
that
he
alone
read
her
heart
and
knew
her
to
be
reprobate
hardened
and
unregenerate
and
that
she
must
finally
and
inevitably
come
to
be
the
prey
of
the
worm
that
dieth
not
and
the
fire
that
is
never
quenched
the
sufferings
of
this
innocent
young
creature
under
this
terrible
persuasion
were
dreadful
and
the
more
so
because
she
communicated
them
to
none
had
she
displayed
the
secret
terrors
of
her
soul
to
cartwright
or
her
mother
she
knew
she
should
be
told
with
praises
and
caresses
that
she
was
only
the
more
blessed
and
sure
of
immortal
glory
for
feeling
them
had
she
opened
her
heart
to
her
sister
her
brother
or
rosalind
her
sufferings
would
probably
have
soon
ceased
but
from
this
she
shrank
as
from
degradation
unbearable
poor
rosalind
meanwhile
was
as
profoundly
unhappy
as
it
was
well
possible
for
a
girl
to
be
who
was
young
beautiful
rich
talented
not
crossed
in
love
and
moreover
in
perfect
health
young
mowbray
had
just
taken
a
distinguished
degree
at
oxford
and
having
given
a
farewell
banquet
to
his
college
friends
returned
home
with
the
hope
of
speedily
obtaining
the
commission
in
a
regiment
of
horse
for
which
his
name
had
been
long
ago
put
down
by
his
father
it
was
at
this
time
that
several
circumstances
occurred
at
wrexhill
sufficiently
important
to
the
principal
personages
of
my
narrative
to
be
recorded
at
some
length
chapter
fanny
a
visit
to
oakley
it
was
towards
the
end
of
november
that
young
mowbray
returned
from
oxford
to
his
mother
house
in
hampshire
as
usual
the
first
three
or
four
hours
chat
with
helen
and
rosalind
put
him
of
all
that
had
taken
place
during
his
absence
the
retrospect
was
not
a
cheering
one
yet
most
of
the
circumstances
which
tended
to
annoy
him
were
of
that
minor
kind
which
none
but
a
very
gossiping
correspondent
would
detail
and
helen
was
not
such
besides
since
the
mysterious
letter
which
had
recalled
charles
to
keep
watch
over
fanny
the
full
and
true
purpose
of
which
letter
he
had
never
yet
discovered
miss
torrington
had
not
written
to
him
and
as
she
was
now
the
chief
historian
her
round
and
unvarnished
tale
made
him
acquainted
with
many
particulars
to
which
helen
had
scarcely
alluded
in
her
correspondence
with
him
helen
mowbray
was
not
a
spirit
to
exhaust
itself
and
its
sorrows
by
breathing
unavailing
complaints
and
though
her
brother
had
pretty
clearly
understood
from
her
letters
that
she
was
not
happy
or
comfortable
at
home
it
was
from
rosalind
he
first
learned
how
many
circumstances
were
daily
occurring
to
make
her
otherwise
the
only
point
on
which
he
blamed
her
or
in
which
according
to
rosalind
account
she
had
shown
more
yielding
and
as
he
called
it
weakness
than
her
helpless
and
most
unhappy
position
rendered
unavoidable
was
in
the
never
having
attempted
to
see
lady
harrington
this
he
declared
was
in
itself
wrong
and
rendered
doubly
so
by
her
situation
which
would
have
rendered
the
society
and
counsel
of
such
a
friend
invaluable
but
he
did
not
know
even
rosalind
did
not
know
that
this
forbearance
for
which
he
blamed
her
was
the
result
of
those
qualities
for
which
they
most
loved
her
but
helen
knew
though
they
did
not
that
if
she
had
gone
to
oakley
she
should
have
thought
more
of
hearing
news
of
colonel
harrington
than
of
any
advice
her
godmother
could
have
given
her
and
have
been
infinitely
more
anxious
to
learn
if
he
ever
mentioned
her
in
his
letters
than
to
know
whether
lady
harrington
thought
it
best
that
she
should
be
civil
or
that
she
should
be
rude
in
her
demeanour
towards
the
vicar
of
wrexhill
it
was
this
conscious
weakness
which
lent
strength
to
the
unreasonable
violence
of
her
mother
on
this
point
had
helen
been
quite
and
altogether
she
would
have
had
courage
to
discover
that
a
passionate
prohibition
originating
as
she
could
not
doubt
it
did
with
a
man
for
whom
she
entertained
no
species
of
esteem
ought
not
to
make
her
abandon
one
of
the
kindest
friends
she
had
ever
known
but
there
is
a
feeling
stronger
than
reason
in
a
young
girl
breast
and
again
and
again
this
feeling
had
whispered
to
helen
is
not
maidenly
to
go
to
the
house
of
a
man
that
i
fear
i
love
and
that
i
hope
loves
me
for
the
chance
of
hearing
his
name
mentioned
and
that
too
when
my
mother
forbids
me
to
enter
his
father
doors
but
there
was
an
authority
in
charles
voice
when
he
said
you
have
been
wrong
helen
which
seemed
to
have
power
even
over
this
and
she
promised
that
if
after
he
paid
the
visit
to
oakley
which
he
was
fully
determined
to
do
on
the
morrow
he
should
report
that
her
friends
there
were
not
too
angry
to
receive
her
she
would
consent
to
volunteer
a
visit
to
them
assigning
as
her
reason
for
doing
so
to
her
mother
that
it
was
charles
wish
this
conversation
took
place
on
the
night
of
his
arrival
and
lasted
for
some
hours
after
every
individual
of
the
household
excepting
those
engaged
in
it
were
in
bed
poor
fanny
was
among
those
who
had
the
earliest
retired
but
she
was
not
among
the
sleepers
she
too
had
once
loved
charles
most
dearly
and
most
dearly
had
she
been
loved
in
return
but
now
she
felt
that
they
were
separated
for
ever
in
this
world
and
that
if
they
were
doomed
to
meet
in
the
world
to
come
it
could
only
be
amidst
torturing
and
devouring
flames
as
she
knelt
for
long
hours
beside
her
bed
before
she
dared
to
lay
her
aching
head
on
the
pillow
her
thoughts
reverted
to
her
early
youth
and
to
all
the
innocent
delights
she
had
enjoyed
with
him
and
the
now
avoided
helen
and
as
she
remembered
the
ecstasy
with
which
she
once
enjoyed
the
bloom
of
flowers
the
songs
of
birds
the
breath
of
early
morning
and
all
the
poetry
of
nature
tears
of
silent
unacknowledged
but
most
bitter
regret
streamed
from
her
eyes
but
then
again
came
the
ague
fit
of
visionary
remorse
and
genuine
calvinistic
terror
and
she
groaned
aloud
in
agony
of
spirit
for
having
suffered
these
natural
tears
to
fall
this
dreadful
vigil
left
such
traces
on
the
pale
cheek
and
heavy
eye
of
the
suffering
girl
that
her
brother
heart
ached
as
he
looked
at
her
and
though
with
little
hope
after
what
he
had
heard
of
doing
any
good
he
determined
to
seek
half
an
hour
conversation
with
her
before
he
went
out
when
she
rose
to
leave
the
therefore
charles
rose
too
and
following
her
out
of
the
room
stopped
her
as
she
was
in
the
act
of
ascending
the
stairs
by
putting
his
arms
round
her
waist
and
saying
fanny
will
you
take
a
walk
with
me
in
the
shrubbery
fanny
started
and
coloured
and
hesitated
as
if
some
deed
of
very
doubtful
tendency
had
been
proposed
to
her
but
he
persevered
come
dear
put
your
bonnet
on
i
will
wait
for
you
here
make
haste
fanny
think
how
long
it
is
since
you
and
i
took
a
walk
together
is
helen
going
the
question
was
asked
in
a
voice
that
trembled
for
the
idea
that
charles
meant
during
this
walk
to
question
her
concerning
her
faith
occurred
to
her
and
she
would
have
given
much
to
avoid
it
but
before
she
could
invent
an
excuse
for
doing
so
her
conscience
always
ready
to
enforce
the
doing
whatever
was
most
disagreeable
to
her
suggested
that
this
shrinking
looked
like
being
ashamed
of
her
principles
and
no
sooner
had
this
idea
suggested
itself
than
she
said
readily
very
well
charles
i
will
come
to
you
in
a
moment
but
the
moment
was
rather
a
long
one
for
fanny
before
she
rejoined
him
knelt
down
and
made
an
extempore
prayer
for
courage
and
strength
to
resist
and
render
of
no
effect
whatever
he
might
say
to
her
thus
prepared
she
set
forth
ready
to
listen
with
the
most
determined
obstinacy
to
any
argument
which
might
tend
to
overthrow
any
part
of
the
creed
that
was
poisoning
the
very
sources
of
her
life
you
are
not
looking
well
my
fanny
said
her
brother
fondly
pressing
her
arm
as
they
turned
into
the
most
sheltered
part
of
the
garden
do
you
think
the
morning
too
cold
for
walking
my
love
you
used
to
be
such
a
hardy
little
thing
fanny
that
you
cared
for
nothing
but
i
am
afraid
the
case
is
different
now
this
was
not
exactly
the
opening
that
fanny
expected
and
there
was
a
tenderness
in
the
tone
of
his
voice
that
almost
softened
her
heart
towards
him
but
she
answered
not
a
word
perhaps
she
feared
to
trust
her
voice
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
dearest
if
any
sorrow
or
vexation
has
chased
away
the
bloom
and
the
gladness
that
we
all
so
loved
to
look
upon
tell
me
fanny
what
is
it
that
has
changed
you
so
sadly
you
will
not
then
you
do
not
love
me
as
i
love
you
for
i
am
sure
if
i
had
a
sorrow
i
should
open
my
heart
to
you
when
a
christian
has
a
sorrow
brother
charles
he
should
open
his
heart
to
heaven
and
not
to
a
poor
sinful
mortal
as
wicked
and
as
weak
as
himself
but
surely
my
dear
fanny
that
need
not
prevent
a
brother
and
sister
from
conversing
with
the
greatest
confidence
together
how
many
texts
i
could
quote
you
in
which
family
unity
and
affection
are
inculcated
in
the
bible
pray
do
not
quote
the
bible
said
fanny
in
a
voice
of
alarm
till
the
right
spirit
has
come
upon
you
it
is
a
grievous
sin
to
do
it
or
to
hear
it
be
assured
fanny
that
i
feel
quite
as
averse
to
quoting
the
bible
irreverently
as
you
can
do
but
tell
me
why
it
is
you
think
that
the
right
spirit
as
you
call
it
has
not
come
upon
me
as
i
call
it
repeated
fanny
shuddering
it
is
not
i
charles
it
is
one
of
heaven
saints
who
says
it
and
it
is
a
sin
for
me
to
listen
to
you
it
is
doubtless
cartwright
who
says
it
fanny
is
it
not
so
and
who
has
so
good
a
right
to
say
it
as
the
minister
of
your
parish
and
the
friend
and
protector
that
heaven
has
sent
to
your
widowed
mother
poor
mowbray
felt
his
heart
swell
it
was
difficult
to
hear
the
man
who
had
come
between
him
and
all
his
best
duties
and
affections
named
in
this
manner
as
his
own
maligner
and
restrain
his
just
and
natural
indignation
yet
he
did
restrain
it
and
said
in
a
voice
of
the
utmost
gentleness
do
you
think
my
beloved
fanny
cartwright
influence
in
this
house
has
been
for
our
happiness
may
the
lord
forgive
me
for
listening
to
such
words
exclaimed
fanny
with
that
look
of
nervous
terror
which
her
beautiful
face
now
so
often
expressed
but
he
ca
he
ca
i
know
it
i
know
it
it
is
my
doom
to
sin
and
you
are
only
an
agent
of
that
enemy
who
is
for
ever
seeking
my
soul
to
destroy
leave
me
leave
me
fanny
this
is
dreadful
can
you
really
believe
that
the
god
of
love
and
mercy
will
hold
you
guilty
for
listening
to
the
voice
of
your
brother
what
have
i
ever
done
my
fanny
to
deserve
to
be
thus
driven
from
your
presence
the
unhappy
girl
look
bewildered
done
she
exclaimed
what
have
you
done
is
not
that
works
is
not
that
of
works
you
speak
charles
oh
he
knew
he
foretold
he
prophesied
unto
me
that
i
should
be
spoken
to
of
works
and
that
i
should
listen
thereunto
to
my
everlasting
destruction
if
i
confessed
not
my
soul
to
him
upon
the
instant
i
must
seek
him
out
he
said
if
oh
that
dear
blessed
if
let
go
my
arm
brother
charles
let
me
seek
my
salvation
fanny
this
is
madness
she
looked
at
him
poor
girl
as
he
said
this
with
an
expression
that
brought
tears
to
his
eyes
that
look
seemed
to
speak
a
dreadful
doubt
whether
the
words
he
had
spoken
were
not
true
she
pressed
her
hand
against
her
forehead
for
a
moment
and
then
said
in
a
voice
of
the
most
touching
sadness
heaven
help
me
oh
fanny
darling
fanny
cried
the
terrified
brother
throwing
his
arms
round
her
save
us
from
the
anguish
of
seeing
you
destroyed
body
and
mind
by
this
frightful
this
impious
doctrine
listen
to
me
my
own
sweet
girl
think
that
from
me
you
hear
the
voice
of
your
father
of
the
good
and
pious
wallace
of
your
excellent
and
exemplary
governess
and
drive
this
maddening
terror
from
you
did
you
live
without
god
in
the
world
fanny
when
you
lived
under
their
virtuous
rule
how
often
have
you
heard
your
dear
father
say
when
he
came
forth
and
looked
upon
the
beauty
of
the
groves
and
lawns
bright
in
the
morning
sunshine
the
lord
my
children
for
his
goodness
for
his
mercy
endureth
for
ever
did
not
these
words
raise
your
young
heart
to
heaven
more
than
all
the
frightful
denunciations
which
have
almost
shaken
your
reason
works
works
oh
charles
let
me
go
from
you
your
voice
is
like
the
voice
of
a
serpent
it
creeps
dreadfully
near
my
heart
and
i
shall
perish
everlastingly
perish
if
i
listen
to
you
if
is
there
yet
an
if
for
me
now
let
me
go
charles
let
me
seek
him
if
you
love
me
let
me
seek
my
salvation
do
you
mean
that
you
would
seek
cartwright
fanny
you
do
not
mean
to
go
to
his
house
do
you
his
house
how
little
you
know
him
charles
think
you
that
he
would
leave
me
and
my
poor
mother
to
perish
poor
poor
charles
you
do
not
even
know
that
this
shepherd
and
guardian
of
our
souls
prays
with
us
daily
prays
with
you
where
does
he
pray
with
you
in
mamma
and
who
are
present
at
these
prayers

and

and
curtis
and

who
is

fanny
the
new
that
our
minister
recommended
charles
when
that
poor
deluded
dick
bragg
was
found
walking
in
the
fields
with
his
sister
patty
on
the
sabbath
you
do
mean
that
dick
bragg
is
turned
away
he
was
without
exception
the
steadiest
lad
in
the
parish
works
works
exclaimed
fanny
wringing
her
hands
oh
charles
how
your
poor
soul
clings
to
the
perdition
of
works
gracious
heaven
exclaimed
mowbray
with
great
emotion
where
will
all
this
end
what
an
existence
for
helen
for
rosalind
is
there
no
cure
for
this
folly
this
madness
on
one
side
and
this
infernal
craft
and
hypocrisy
on
the
other
on
hearing
these
words
fanny
uttered
a
cry
which
very
nearly
amounted
to
a
scream
and
running
off
towards
the
house
with
the
fleetness
of
a
startled
fawn
left
her
brother
in
a
state
of
irritation
and
misery
such
as
he
had
never
suffered
before
the
idea
of
seeing
sir
gilbert
harrington
immediately
had
perhaps
more
comfort
and
consolation
in
it
than
any
other
which
could
have
suggested
itself
and
the
lanes
and
the
fields
which
divided
oakley
from
mowbray
were
traversed
at
a
pace
that
soon
brought
the
agitated
young
man
to
the
baronet
door
is
sir
gilbert
at
home
john
he
demanded
of
an
old
servant
who
had
known
him
from
childhood
but
instead
of
the
door
and
ready
smile
which
used
to
greet
him
he
received
a
grave
and
hesitating
i
do
know
sir
from
the
changed
domestic
is
lady
harrington
at
home
said
charles
vexed
and
colouring
it
is
likely
she
may
be
mowbray
said
the
old
man
relentingly
will
you
please
to
wait
one
moment
master
charles
i
think
my
lady
ca
refuse
charles
heart
was
full
but
he
did
wait
and
john
speedily
returned
saying
almost
in
a
whisper
please
to
walk
in
sir
but
you
must
go
into
my
lady
closet
that
the
only
safe
place
she
says
safe
repeated
charles
but
he
made
no
objection
to
the
taking
refuge
in
my
lady
closet
and
in
another
moment
he
found
himself
not
only
in
the
closet
but
in
the
arms
of
the
good
old
lady
oh
if
sir
gilbert
could
see
me
she
exclaimed
after
very
heartily
hugging
the
young
man
he
a
greater
tiger
than
ever
charles
and
i
really
do
know
which
of
us
would
be
torn
to
pieces
first
but
only
tell
me
one
thing
before
i
abuse
him
any
more
how
long
have
you
been
at
home
the
coach
broke
down
at
newberry
replied
charles
and
i
did
not
get
to
mowbray
till
nine
last
night
thank
heaven
ejaculated
lady
harrington
very
fervently
then
hope
at
least
for
but
what
on
earth
can
you
say
to
me
of
my
beautiful
helen
three
months
charles
three
whole
months
since
she
has
been
near
me
and
she
knows
i
dote
upon
her
and
that
sir
gilbert
himself
untameable
hyena
as
he
is
has
always
been
loving
and
gentle
to
her
as
far
as
his
nature
would
permit
then
why
has
she
treated
us
thus
you
ca
wonder
can
you
that
he
swears
lustily
every
morning
that
ingratitude
is
worse
than
all
the
mortal
sins
put
together
i
dare
not
throw
the
charge
back
upon
you
my
dear
lady
and
yet
it
is
being
ungrateful
for
poor
helen
true
affection
to
believe
it
possible
that
she
should
so
long
have
remained
absent
from
you
by
her
own
free
will
you
know
not
dearest
lady
harrington
what
my
poor
helen
has
to
endure
endure
what
do
you
mean
charles
surely
there
is
nobody
living
who
dares
to
be
unkind
to
her
my
poor
boy
i
am
almost
ashamed
to
ask
the
question
but
you
will
forgive
an
old
friend
is
there
any
truth
charles
in
that
abominable
report
that
horrid
report
you
know
about
your
mother
what
report
lady
harrington
said
mowbray
colouring
like
scarlet
i
have
heard
no
report
excepting
that
which
is
indeed
too
sure
and
certain
to
be
called
a
report
namely
that
she
has
become
a
violent
calvinistic
methodist
that
bad
enough
my
dear
charles
bad
enough
of
all
conscience
and
yet
i
have
heard
of
what
would
be
worse
still
i
have
heard
charles
that
she
is
going
to
be
weak
and
wicked
enough
to
marry
that
odious
hypocritical
tartuffe
the
vicar
of
wrexhill
mowbray
put
his
hand
before
his
eyes
as
if
he
had
been
blasted
by
lightning
and
then
replied
as
steadily
as
he
could
i
have
never
heard
this
lady
harrington
then
i
trust
i
trust
it
is
not
true
charles
helen
surely
and
that
creature
miss
torrington
who
have
both
i
believe
for
heaven
help
me
i
do
know
both
i
believe
been
staying
all
the
time
at
mowbray
and
surely
and
surely
if
this
most
atrocious
deed
were
contemplated
they
must
have
some
knowledge
of
it
and
that
they
certainly
have
not
returned
charles
with
recovered
courage
for
i
sat
with
them
both
for
two
or
three
hours
last
night
listening
to
their
miserable
account
of
this
man
detestable
influence
over
my
mother
and
fanny
and
certainly
they
would
not
have
concealed
from
me
such
a
suspicion
as
this
had
any
such
existed
in
the
breast
of
either
quite
true
my
dear
boy
and
i
can
hardly
tell
you
how
welcome
this
assurance
is
to
me
not
for
your
mother
sake
charles
if
you
can
not
bear
the
truth
you
must
not
come
to
me
and
on
this
point
the
truth
is
that
i
do
care
one
single
straw
about
your
mother
i
never
shall
forgive
her
for
not
answering
sir
gilbert
note
i
know
what
the
writing
it
cost
him
dear
proud
old
fellow
and
not
to
answer
it
not
to
tell
her
children
of
it
no
i
never
shall
forgive
her
and
i
should
not
care
the
value
of
a
rat
tail
if
she
were
to
marry
every
tub
preacher
throughout
england
and
all
their
clerks
in
succession
that
is
not
for
her
own
sake
i
dare
say
she
preach
in
a
tub
herself
before
she
has
done
with
it
but
for
your
sakes
my
dear
souls
i
do
rejoice
that
it
is
not
true
that
would
indeed
complete
our
misery
and
it
is
already
quite
bad
enough
i
assure
you
the
house
helen
says
is
a
perfect
conventicle
the
girls
are
ordered
to
sing
nothing
but
psalms
and
hymns
some
of
the
latter
so
offensively
ludicrous
too
as
to
be
perfectly
indecent
and
profane
a
long
extempore
sermon
or
lecture
as
he
calls
it
is
delivered
to
the
whole
family
in
the
great
every
night
missionary
boxes
are
not
only
hung
up
beside
every
door
but
actually
carried
round
by
the
butler
whenever
any
one
calls
and
a
hundred
and
fifty
other
absurdities
at
which
we
should
laugh
were
we
in
a
gayer
mood
but
this
farce
has
produced
the
saddest
tragedy
i
ever
witnessed
in
the
effect
it
has
had
upon
our
poor
fanny
i
have
had
some
conversation
with
her
this
morning
and
i
do
assure
you
that
i
greatly
fear
her
reason
is
unsettled
or
like
to
be
so
heaven
forbid
charles
pretty
innocent
young
thing
that
would
be
too
horrible
to
think
of
the
old
lady
eyes
were
full
of
tears
a
circumstance
very
unusual
with
her
but
the
idea
suggested
struck
her
to
the
heart
and
she
had
not
yet
removed
the
traces
of
this
most
unwonted
proof
of
sensibility
when
a
heavy
thump
was
heard
at
the
door
of
the
closet
who
there
said
her
ladyship
in
a
voice
rather
raised
than
lowered
by
the
emotion
which
dimmed
her
eyes
let
me
in
my
lady
responded
the
voice
of
sir
gilbert
what
do
you
want
sir
gilbert
i
am
busy
so
i
understand
my
lady
and
i
come
to
help
you
will
you
promise
if
i
let
you
in
not
to
hinder
me
instead
i
promise
nothing
except
to
quarrel
with
you
if
you
do
not
was
there
ever
such
a
tyrant
come
in
then
see
hear
and
understand
the
door
was
opened
and
sir
gilbert
harrington
and
charles
mowbray
stood
face
to
face
charles
smiled
and
held
out
his
hand
the
baronet
knit
his
brows
but
the
expression
of
his
mouth
told
her
experienced
ladyship
plainly
enough
that
he
was
well
enough
pleased
at
the
sight
of
his
unexpected
guest
he
only
got
to
mowbray
at
nine
last
night
said
lady
harrington
sir
gilbert
held
out
his
hand
charles
i
am
glad
to
see
you
said
he
thank
heaven
ejaculated
the
old
lady
my
dear
sir
gilbert
said
charles
i
have
learnt
your
kind
and
friendly
anger
at
the
prolonged
absence
of
my
poor
sister
the
fault
is
not
hers
sir
gilbert
she
has
been
most
strictly
forbidden
to
visit
you
by
her
mother
by
her
mother
sir
gilbert
and
pray
charles
do
you
think
it
her
duty
to
obey
i
really
know
not
how
to
answer
you
for
a
girl
just
nineteen
to
act
in
declared
defiance
of
the
commands
of
her
mother
and
that
mother
her
sole
surviving
parent
is
a
line
of
conduct
almost
too
bold
to
advise
and
yet
such
is
the
lamentable
state
of
infatuation
to
which
my
mother
mind
appears
to
be
reduced
by
the
pernicious
influence
of
this
cartwright
that
i
think
it
would
be
more
dangerous
still
to
recommend
obedience
upon
my
life
i
think
so
replied
sir
gilbert
in
an
accent
that
showed
he
thought
the
proposition
too
to
be
discussed
i
have
been
devilish
angry
with
the
girls
with
helen
i
mean
for
i
understand
that
little
idiot
fanny
is
just
as
mad
as
her
mother
but
that
helen
and
that
fine
girl
rosalind
torrington
should
shut
themselves
up
with
an
hypocritical
fanatic
and
a
canting
mad
woman
is
enough
to
put
any
man
out
of
patience
the
situation
has
been
almost
enough
to
put
helen
in
her
grave
she
looks
wretchedly
and
miss
torrington
is
no
longer
the
same
creature
it
would
wring
your
heart
to
see
these
poor
girls
sir
gilbert
and
what
are
they
to
do
come
to
us
charles
let
them
both
come
here
instantly
and
remain
here
till
your
mother
mad
fit
is
over
if
it
lasts
i
shall
advise
you
to
take
out
a
commission
of
lunacy
the
madness
is
not
such
as
a
physician
would
recognise
sir
gilbert
and
yet
i
give
you
my
honour
that
from
many
things
which
my
sister
and
miss
torrington
told
me
last
night
i
really
do
think
my
mother
reason
must
be
in
some
degree
deranged
and
for
my
poor
little
fanny
six
months
ago
the
pride
and
darling
of
us
all
she
is
i
am
quite
persuaded
on
the
verge
of
insanity
and
you
mean
to
leave
her
in
the
power
of
that
distracted
driveller
her
mother
that
the
work
may
be
finished
what
can
i
do
sir
gilbert
remove
them
all
take
them
instantly
away
from
her
i
tell
you
the
blood
rushed
painfully
to
poor
mowbray
face
you
forget
sir
gilbert
he
said
that
i
have
not
the
means
you
forget
my
will
no
sir
i
do
not
forget
it
nor
do
i
forget
either
that
had
i
not
in
a
fit
of
contemptible
passion
refused
to
act
as
executor
i
might
i
think
it
possible
i
might
have
plagued
her
heart
out
and
so
done
some
good
i
shall
never
forgive
myself
but
you
could
have
given
us
no
power
over
the
property
sir
gilbert
we
are
beggars
i
know
it
i
know
it
replied
the
old
gentleman
clenching
his
fists
i
told
you
so
from
the
first
and
now
mark
my
words
she
marry
her
saint
before
she
six
months
older
i
trust
that
in
this
you
are
mistaken
the
girls
have
certainly
no
suspicions
of
the
sort
the
girls
are
fools
as
girls
always
are
but
let
them
come
here
i
tell
you
and
we
may
save
their
lives
at
any
rate
tell
them
both
from
me
charles
that
they
shall
find
a
home
and
a
happy
one
here
but
do
let
them
chill
that
old
man
heart
again
by
taking
no
notice
of
this
and
keeping
out
of
his
sight
for
another
three
months
he
have
the
gout
in
his
stomach
as
sure
as
they
born
just
tell
helen
that
from
me
mowbray
warmly
expressed
his
gratitude
for
their
kindness
and
though
he
would
not
undertake
to
promise
that
either
helen
or
miss
torrington
would
immediately
decide
upon
leaving
his
mother
house
in
open
defiance
of
her
commands
he
promised
that
they
should
both
come
over
on
the
morrow
to
be
cheered
and
supported
by
the
assurance
of
their
continued
friendship
he
was
then
preparing
to
take
his
leave
when
lady
harrington
laid
her
hand
upon
his
arm
saying
listen
to
me
charles
for
a
moment
those
dear
girls
and
you
too
my
dear
boy
you
are
all
surrounded
with
great
difficulties
and
some
consideration
is
necessary
as
to
how
you
shall
meet
them
best
it
wo
do
sir
gilbert
it
will
be
neither
right
nor
proper
in
any
way
for
helen
to
set
off
at
once
in
utter
and
open
defiance
of
mowbray
what
i
advise
is
that
charles
should
go
home
take
his
mother
apart
and
like
hamlet
in
the
closet
scene
daggers
but
use
none
it
does
not
appear
from
all
we
have
yet
heard
that
any
one
has
hitherto
attempted
to
point
out
to
her
the
deplorable
folly
ay
and
wickedness
too
which
she
is
committing
i
do
not
believe
she
would
admit
sir
gilbert
and
to
say
the
truth
i
do
think
it
would
be
very
safe
to
trust
him
with
the
job
d
n
it
i
wish
you
would
interrupted
sir
gilbert
i
should
like
to
have
the
talking
to
her
only
just
for
an
hour
and
i
consent
to
have
the
gout
for
a
month
afterwards
i
would
upon
my
soul
do
be
tame
for
a
moment
you
wild
man
of
the
woods
said
her
ladyship
laying
her
hand
upon
his
mouth
and
let
me
finish
what
i
was
saying
no
no
sir
gilbert
is
not
the
proper
person
but
you
are
charles
speak
to
her
with
gentleness
with
kindness
but
tell
her
if
you
find
her
contrite
and
yielding
use
your
victory
with
moderation
and
let
her
down
easily
from
her
giddy
elevation
of
saintship
to
the
sober
quiet
even
path
of
rational
religion
and
domestic
duty
but
if
she
be
restive
if
she
still
persist
in
forbidding
helen
to
visit
her
father
oldest
friends
while
making
her
own
once
happy
home
a
prison
and
a
wretched
one
then
charles
mowbray
i
would
tell
her
roundly
that
she
must
choose
between
her
children
and
her
tartuffe
and
that
if
she
keeps
him
she
must
lose
you
bravo
capital
old
lady
if
charles
will
just
say
all
that
we
shall
be
able
to
guess
by
the
result
as
to
how
things
are
between
them
and
we
must
act
accordingly
you
have
your
allowance
paid
regularly
charles
i
think
she
doubled
it
she
after
your
father
died
charles
looked
embarrassed
but
answered
yes
sir
gilbert
my
allowance
was
doubled
come
boy
do
answer
like
a
is
it
regularly
paid
that
was
my
question
my
main
question
the
first
quarter
was
paid
sir
gilbert
but
before
i
left
the
university
instead
of
the
remittance
i
received
a
letter
from
my
mother
desiring
me
to
transmit
a
statement
of
all
my
debts
to
stephen
corbold
esq
solicitor
wrexhill
and
that
they
should
be
attended
to
which
would
she
added
be
more
satisfactory
to
her
than
sending
my
allowance
without
knowing
how
i
stood
with
my
tradesmen
and
have
you
done
this
my
fine
sir
said
sir
gilbert
becoming
almost
purple
with
anger
no
sir
gilbert
i
have
not
the
baronet
threw
his
arms
round
him
and
gave
him
a
tremendous
hug
i
see
you
are
worth
caring
for
my
boy
i
should
never
have
forgiven
you
if
you
had
audacious
rascal
why
charles
that
corbold
has
been
poking
his
snuffling
hypocritical
nose
into
every
house
not
only
in
your
parish
but
in
mine
and
in
at
least
a
dozen
others
and
has
positively
beat
poor
old
gaspar
brown
out
of
the
field
the
old
man
called
to
take
leave
of
me
not
a
week
ago
and
told
me
that
one
after
another
very
nearly
every
client
he
had
in
this
part
of
the
world
had
come
or
sent
to
him
for
their
papers
in
order
to
deposit
them
with
this
canting
corbold
and
as
i
hear
all
the
little
farmers
for
miles
round
are
diligently
going
to
law
in
the
name
of
the
lord
but
what
did
you
do
my
dear
boy
for
money
oh
i
have
managed
pretty
well
it
was
a
disappointment
certainly
and
at
first
i
felt
a
little
awkward
for
the
letter
did
not
reach
me
till
i
had
ordered
my
farewell
supper
and
as
in
truth
i
had
no
bills
to
pay
i
gave
my
orders
pretty
liberally
and
of
course
have
been
obliged
to
leave
the
account
unpaid
an
arrangement
which
to
many
others
would
have
had
nothing
awkward
in
it
at
all
but
as
my
allowance
has
been
always
too
liberal
to
permit
my
being
in
debt
during
any
part
of
the
time
i
have
been
at
college
the
not
paying
my
last
bill
there
was
disagreeable
however
the
people
were
abundantly
civil
and
i
flatter
myself
that
without
the
assistance
of
corbold
i
shall
be
able
to
settle
this
matter
before
long
what
is
the
sum
you
have
left
unpaid
charles
inquired
the
baronet
bluntly
pounds
sir
gilbert
then
just
sit
down
for
half
a
moment
and
write
a
line
enclosing
the
money
you
may
cut
the
notes
in
half
if
you
think
there
is
any
danger
and
as
he
spoke
he
laid
to
the
amount
of
pounds
on
her
ladyship
botanical
dresser
young
mowbray
who
had
not
the
slightest
doubt
of
receiving
his
allowance
from
his
mother
as
soon
as
he
should
ask
her
for
it
would
rather
not
have
been
under
a
pecuniary
obligation
even
for
a
day
but
he
caught
the
eye
of
lady
harrington
who
was
standing
behind
her
impetuous
husband
and
received
thence
a
perfectly
intelligible
hint
that
he
must
not
refuse
the
offer
most
anxious
to
avoid
renewing
the
coldness
so
recently
removed
he
readily
and
graciously
accepted
the
offered
loan
and
thereby
most
perfectly
the
harmony
which
had
existed
throughout
his
life
between
himself
and
the
but
impetuous
sir
gilbert
now
then
said
the
old
gentleman
with
the
most
cordial
and
happy
be
off
my
dear
boy
follow
my
dame
advice
to
the
letter
and
come
back
as
soon
as
you
conveniently
can
to
let
us
know
what
comes
of
it
cheered
in
spirit
by
this
warm
renewal
of
the
friendship
he
so
truly
valued
young
mowbray
set
off
on
his
homeward
walk
pondering
as
he
went
on
the
best
mode
of
opening
such
a
conversation
with
his
mother
as
lady
harrington
recommended
a
task
both
difficult
and
disagreeable
but
one
which
he
believed
it
his
duty
not
to
shrink
from
chapter
xi
charles
conference
with
mowbray
strolling
in
the
shrubbery
near
the
house
where
for
some
time
they
had
been
anxiously
awaiting
his
return
he
met
his
eldest
sister
and
miss
torrington
helen
first
words
were
are
they
angry
with
me
and
the
reply
and
subsequent
history
of
the
visit
filled
her
heart
with
gladness
and
now
my
privy
counsellors
continued
charles
tell
me
at
what
hour
you
should
deem
it
most
prudent
for
me
to
ask
my
mother
for
an
audience
instantly
said
rosalind
had
he
not
better
wait
till
said
helen
turning
very
pale
if
my
advisers
disagree
among
themselves
i
am
lost
said
charles
for
i
give
you
my
word
that
i
never
in
my
whole
life
entered
upon
an
undertaking
which
made
me
feel
so
anxious
and
undecided
let
me
hear
your
reasons
for
thus
differing
in
opinion
why
rosalind
do
you
recommend
such
prodigious
promptitude
because
i
hate
suspense
and
because
i
know
the
scene
will
be
disagreeable
to
you
wherefore
i
opine
that
the
sooner
you
get
over
it
the
better
and
you
helen
why
do
you
wish
me
to
delay
it
till
because
oh
charles
because
i
dread
the
result
you
have
no
idea
as
yet
how
completely
her
temper
is
changed
she
is
very
stern
charles
when
she
is
contradicted
and
if
you
should
make
her
angry
depend
upon
it
that
it
would
be
cartwright
who
would
dictate
your
punishment
my
punishment
nonsense
helen
i
shall
make
miss
torrington
both
my
chancellor
and
archbishop
for
her
advice
has
infinitely
more
wisdom
in
it
than
yours
where
is
she
in
her
own
i
believe
so
faltered
helen
well
then
adieu
for
half
an
hour
perhaps
for
a
whole
one
where
shall
i
find
you
when
it
is
over
in
my
said
helen
no
no
cried
rosalind
i
would
not
have
to
sit
with
you
there
for
an
hour
watching
you
quiver
and
quake
every
time
a
door
opened
for
my
heiresship
let
us
walk
to
the
great
and
stay
there
till
you
come
and
so
envelop
yourselves
in
a
november
woodland
fog
wherein
to
sit
waiting
till
about
four
the
wisdom
lies
with
helen
this
time
miss
torrington
i
think
you
have
both
of
you
been
pelted
long
enough
with
falling
leaves
for
and
therefore
i
strongly
recommend
that
you
come
in
and
wait
for
my
communication
beside
a
blazing
fire
have
you
no
new
book
no
lively
novel
or
romance
wherewith
to
beguile
the
time
novels
and
romances
oh
mowbray
what
a
desperate
sinner
you
must
be
the
subscription
at
hookham
has
been
out
these
three
months
and
the
same
dear
box
that
used
to
be
brought
in
amidst
the
eager
rejoicings
of
the
whole
family
is
now
become
the
monthly
vehicle
of
evangelical
magazines
christian
observers
missionary
reports
and
religious
tracts
of
all
imaginable
sorts
and
sizes
we
have
no
other
modern
literature
allowed
us
poor
girls
said
charles
laughing
what
do
you
do
for
books
why
the
old
library
supplies
us
indifferently
well
i
must
confess
and
as
fanny
has
changed
her
morning
quarters
from
thence
to
the
which
is
now
converted
into
a
chapel
of
ease
for
the
vicar
we
contrive
to
abduct
from
thence
such
volumes
as
we
wish
for
without
difficulty
but
we
were
once
very
near
getting
a
book
which
i
have
been
told
is
of
the
most
exquisite
interest
and
pathos
of
any
in
the
language
by
a
pleasant
blunder
of
mowbray
i
chanced
to
be
in
the
room
with
her
one
day
when
she
read
aloud
an
old
advertisement
which
she
happened
to
glance
her
eye
upon
stitched
up
in
a
review
of
some
dozen
years
standing
i
believe
passages
in
the
life
of
adam
blair
minister
of
the
gospel
a
book
we
ought
to
have
said
she
very
solemnly
give
me
that
list
for
hatchard
i
will
add
this
i
took
up
the
advertisement
as
she
laid
it
down
and
not
having
it
before
her
eyes
i
suspect
that
she
made
some
blunder
about
the
title
for
when
the
box
came
down
i
took
care
to
be
present
at
the
opening
of
it
and
to
my
great
amusement
instead
of
the
little
volume
that
i
was
hoping
to
see
i
beheld
all
blair
works
with
a
scrap
of
paper
from
one
of
the
shopmen
on
which
was
written
mowbray
is
respectfully
informed
that
the
whole
of
blair
works
are
herewith
forwarded
but
that
is
not
aware
of
any
other
life
of
adam
than
that
written
by
moses
this
was
a
terrible
disappointment
to
me
i
assure
you
they
had
now
reached
the
house
the
two
girls
withdrew
their
arms
and
having
watched
charles
mount
the
stairs
they
turned
into
the
drawing
room
and
from
thence
to
the
conservatory
and
then
back
again
and
then
up
stairs
to
lay
aside
their
bonnets
and
cloaks
and
then
down
again
first
one
and
then
the
other
looking
at
their
watches
till
they
began
to
suspect
that
they
must
both
of
them
stand
still
or
something
very
like
it
so
creepingly
did
the
time
pass
during
which
they
waited
for
his
return
on
reaching
the
door
charles
knocked
and
it
was
opened
to
him
by
fanny
the
fair
brow
of
his
mother
contracted
at
his
approach
and
he
immediately
suspected
what
was
indeed
the
fact
that
fanny
had
been
relating
to
her
the
conversation
which
had
passed
between
them
in
the
morning
he
rather
rejoiced
at
this
than
the
contrary
as
he
thought
the
conversation
could
not
be
better
opened
than
by
his
expressing
his
opinions
and
feelings
upon
what
had
fallen
from
her
during
this
interview
he
did
not
however
wish
that
she
should
be
present
and
therefore
said
will
you
let
me
dear
mother
say
a
few
words
to
you
come
fanny
run
away
will
you
for
a
little
while
fanny
instantly
left
the
room
and
mowbray
without
answering
his
request
sat
silently
waiting
for
what
he
was
about
to
say
i
want
to
speak
to
you
mother
about
our
dear
fanny
i
assure
you
i
am
very
uneasy
about
her
i
do
not
think
she
is
in
good
health
either
of
body
or
mind
your
ignorance
of
medicine
is
i
believe
total
charles
she
replied
dryly
and
therefore
your
opinion
concerning
her
bodily
health
does
not
greatly
alarm
me
and
you
must
pardon
me
if
i
say
that
i
conceive
your
ignorance
respecting
all
things
relating
to
a
human
soul
is
more
profound
still
i
am
sorry
you
should
think
so
dearest
mother
but
i
assure
you
that
neither
physic
nor
divinity
have
been
neglected
in
my
education
and
by
whom
have
you
been
taught
blind
guides
have
been
your
teachers
who
have
led
you
i
fear
to
the
very
brink
of
destruction
when
light
is
turned
into
darkness
how
great
is
that
darkness
my
teachers
have
been
those
that
my
dear
father
appointed
me
and
i
have
never
seen
any
cause
to
mistrust
either
their
wisdom
or
their
virtue
mother
and
know
you
not
that
your
poor
unhappy
father
was
benighted
led
astray
and
lost
by
having
himself
listened
to
such
teaching
as
he
caused
to
be
given
to
you
but
you
charles
if
you
did
not
harden
your
heart
even
as
the
nether
millstone
might
even
yet
be
saved
among
the
remnant
put
yourself
into
the
hands
and
under
the
training
of
the
pious
blessed
minister
whom
the
lord
hath
sent
us
open
your
sinful
heart
to
cartwright
charles
and
you
may
save
your
soul
alive
mother
said
charles
with
solemn
earnestness
doctrines
are
dreadful
and
sinful
in
my
eyes
my
excellent
and
most
beloved
father
was
a
protestant
christian
born
educated
and
abiding
to
his
last
hour
in
the
faith
and
hope
taught
by
the
established
church
of
his
country
in
that
faith
and
hope
mother
i
also
have
been
reared
by
him
and
by
you
and
rather
than
change
it
for
the
impious
and
frightful
doctrines
of
the
sectarian
minister
you
name
who
most
dishonestly
has
crept
within
the
pale
of
an
establishment
whose
dogmas
and
discipline
he
profanes
rather
mother
than
adopt
this
cartwright
unholy
belief
and
obey
his
unauthorised
and
unscriptural
decrees
i
would
kneel
down
and
implore
that
my
bones
might
be
at
once
laid
beside
my
father
leave
the
room
charles
mowbray
exclaimed
his
mother
almost
in
a
scream
let
not
the
walls
that
shelter
me
be
witness
to
such
fearful
blasphemy
i
can
not
and
i
will
not
leave
you
mother
till
i
have
told
you
how
very
wretched
you
are
making
me
and
my
poor
sister
helen
by
thus
forsaking
that
form
of
religion
in
which
from
our
earliest
childhood
we
have
been
accustomed
to
see
you
worship
why
why
dearest
mother
should
you
bring
this
dreadful
schism
upon
your
family
can
you
believe
this
to
be
your
duty
by
what
right
human
or
divine
do
you
thus
question
me
lost
unhappy
boy
but
i
will
answer
you
and
i
trust
that
i
shall
be
forgiven
for
intercommuning
with
one
who
lives
in
open
rebellion
to
the
saints
yes
sir
i
do
believe
it
is
my
duty
to
hold
fast
the
conviction
which
heaven
in
its
goodness
has
sent
me
i
do
believe
it
is
my
duty
to
testify
by
my
voice
and
by
every
act
of
my
life
during
the
remaining
time
for
which
the
lord
shall
spare
me
for
the
showing
forth
of
his
glory
that
i
consider
the
years
that
are
past
as
an
abomination
in
his
sight
that
my
living
in
peace
and
happiness
with
your
unawakened
and
unregenerate
father
was
an
abomination
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
and
that
now
at
the
eleventh
hour
my
only
hope
of
being
received
rests
in
my
hating
and
abhorring
and
forsaking
and
turning
away
from
all
that
is
and
has
been
nearest
and
dearest
to
my
sinful
heart
charles
listened
to
this
rant
with
earnest
and
painful
attention
and
when
she
ceased
looked
at
her
through
tears
that
presently
overflowed
his
eyes
have
i
then
lost
my
only
remaining
parent
said
he
and
can
you
thus
close
your
heart
against
me
and
your
poor
helen
my
mother
by
the
blessing
of
providence
i
am
strong
replied
the
deluded
lady
struggling
to
overcome
heaven
best
gift
of
pure
affection
in
her
heart
by
its
blessing
and
by
the
earnest
prayers
of
its
holiest
saint
i
am
able
wretched
boy
to
look
at
thee
and
say
satan
avaunt
but
i
am
tried
sorely
she
continued
turning
her
eyes
from
the
manly
countenance
of
her
son
now
wet
with
tears
sorely
sorely
doomed
and
devoted
boy
am
i
tried
but
he
the
lord
vicar
upon
earth
the
chosen
shepherd
the
anointed
saint
he
even
he
tells
me
to
be
of
good
cheer
for
whom
the
lord
loveth
he
chasteneth
can
you
then
believe
mother
that
the
merciful
god
of
heaven
and
of
earth
approves
your
forsaking
your
children
solely
because
they
worship
him
as
they
have
been
taught
to
do
can
you
believe
that
he
approves
your
turning
your
eyes
and
heart
from
them
to
devote
yourself
to
a
stranger
to
your
blood
a
preacher
of
strange
doctrine
and
one
who
loves
them
not
i
have
already
told
you
impious
maligner
of
the
holiest
of
men
that
i
know
where
my
duty
lies
i
know
i
tell
you
that
i
not
only
know
it
but
will
do
torment
me
no
more
leave
me
leave
me
unhappy
boy
leave
me
that
i
may
pray
for
pardon
for
having
listened
to
thee
so
long
she
rose
from
her
seat
and
approached
him
as
if
to
thrust
him
from
the
chamber
but
he
suffered
her
to
advance
without
moving
and
when
she
was
close
to
him
he
threw
his
arms
round
her
and
held
her
for
a
moment
in
a
close
embrace
she
struggled
violently
to
disengage
herself
and
he
relaxed
his
hold
but
dropping
on
his
knees
before
her
at
the
same
moment
he
exclaimed
with
passionate
tenderness
my
dear
dear
mother
have
i
then
received
your
last
embrace
shall
i
never
again
feel
your
beloved
lips
upon
my
cheeks
my
lips
my
forehead
mother
what
can
helen
and
i
do
to
win
back
your
precious
love
surely
i
shall
be
rewarded
for
this
said
the
infatuated
woman
almost
wildly
surely
i
shall
be
visited
with
an
exceeding
great
reward
and
will
he
not
visit
thee
too
unnatural
son
for
art
not
thou
plotting
against
my
soul
to
destroy
it
there
is
then
no
hope
for
us
from
the
voice
of
nature
no
hope
from
the
voice
of
reason
and
of
truth
then
hear
me
mother
for
i
too
must
act
according
to
the
voice
of
conscience
helen
and
i
must
leave
you
we
can
no
longer
endure
to
be
so
near
you
in
appearance
while
in
reality
we
are
so
fearfully
estranged
you
have
been
very
generous
to
me
in
the
sum
which
you
named
for
my
allowance
at
my
father
death
and
as
soon
as
my
commission
is
obtained
that
allowance
will
suffice
to
support
me
for
my
habits
have
never
been
extravagant
may
i
ask
you
to
assign
a
similar
sum
to
helen
this
will
enable
her
to
command
such
a
home
with
respectable
people
as
may
befit
your
daughter
and
you
will
not
doubt
i
think
notwithstanding
the
unhappy
difference
in
our
opinions
on
points
of
doctrine
that
i
shall
watch
over
her
as
carefully
as
our
dear
father
himself
could
have
done
he
is
a
prophet
yea
a
prophet
exclaimed
mowbray
and
shall
i
be
blind
even
as
the
ungodly
and
doubt
his
word
into
whose
mouth
heaven
hath
put
the
gift
of
prophecy
and
the
words
of
wisdom
he
hath
spoken
and
very
terrible
things
are
come
to
pass
can
your
heart
resist
such
proof
as
this
charles
she
continued
raising
her
eyes
and
hands
to
heaven
even
what
you
have
now
spoken
that
did
he
predict
and
foretell
you
should
speak
he
guessed
the
point
then
at
which
we
could
bear
no
more
replied
charles
with
bitterness
and
did
he
predict
too
what
answer
our
petition
should
receive
he
did
returned
mowbray
either
with
real
or
with
feigned
simplicity
and
even
that
too
shall
be
verified
now
then
hear
his
blessed
voice
through
my
lips
and
as
i
say
so
must
thou
do
go
to
your
benighted
sister
and
tell
her
that
for
her
sake
i
will
wrestle
in
prayer
with
great
and
exceeding
anguish
of
spirit
have
i
already
wrestled
for
her
but
she
is
strong
and
wilful
and
resisteth
nevertheless
i
will
not
give
her
over
to
her
own
desire
nor
will
i
turn
mine
eyes
from
her
for
a
while
longer
i
will
endure
and
for
you
unhappy
son
i
must
take
counsel
from
the
same
holy
of
righteousness
and
what
he
shall
speak
look
that
it
come
to
pass
you
have
denounced
a
terrible
sentence
against
helen
mother
for
nearly
two
years
then
she
must
look
forward
to
a
very
wretched
life
but
without
your
consent
i
can
not
till
she
is
of
age
remove
her
dear
girl
she
has
a
sweet
and
gentle
spirit
and
will
i
trust
be
enabled
to
bear
patiently
her
most
painful
situation
but
as
for
myself
it
may
be
as
well
to
inform
cartwright
at
once
through
you
that
any
interference
with
me
or
my
concerns
will
not
be
endured
and
that
i
advise
him
for
his
own
sake
to
let
me
hear
and
see
as
little
of
him
as
possible
mowbray
seemed
to
listen
to
these
words
in
perfect
terror
as
if
she
feared
a
thunderbolt
must
fall
and
crush
at
once
the
speaker
and
the
hearer
of
such
daring
impiety
but
the
spirit
of
charles
was
chafed
and
conscious
perhaps
that
he
was
in
danger
of
saying
what
he
might
wish
to
recall
on
the
influence
which
his
mother
avowed
that
the
vicar
had
obtained
over
her
he
hastened
to
conclude
the
interview
and
added
i
will
beg
you
immediately
to
give
me
a
draft
for
my
allowance
due
on
the
first
of
this
month
i
want
immediately
to
send
money
to
oxford
did
i
not
tell
you
charles
to
inform
my
man
of
business
that
serious
and
exemplary
man
corbold
what
money
you
owed
in
oxford
and
to
whom
and
did
i
not
inform
you
at
the
same
time
that
he
should
have
instructions
to
acquit
the
same
forthwith
yes
mother
you
certainly
did
send
me
a
letter
to
that
effect
but
as
my
father
permitted
me
before
i
came
of
age
to
pay
my
own
bills
and
to
dispose
of
my
allowance
as
i
thought
fit
i
did
not
choose
to
change
my
usual
manner
of
proceeding
and
therefore
left
what
i
owed
unpaid
preferring
to
remit
the
money
myself
will
you
please
to
give
me
the
means
of
doing
this
now
may
heaven
be
gracious
to
me
and
mine
as
i
steadily
now
and
for
ever
refuse
to
do
so
great
iniquity
think
you
charles
that
i
guided
and
governed
as
i
glory
to
say
i
am
by
one
sent
near
me
by
providence
to
watch
over
me
now
in
my
time
of
need
think
you
that
i
will
hire
and
pay
your
wicked
will
to
defy
it
do
you
mean
then
mother
to
withdraw
my
allowance
said
charles
i
thank
heaven
that
i
do
she
replied
uplifting
her
eyes
and
humbly
on
my
knees
will
i
thank
it
for
giving
me
that
strength
even
in
the
midst
of
weakness
as
she
spoke
she
dropped
upon
her
knees
on
the
floor
with
her
back
towards
her
unhappy
son
he
remained
standing
for
a
few
moments
intending
to
utter
some
nearly
hopeless
words
of
remonstrance
upon
the
cruel
resolution
she
had
just
announced
but
as
she
did
not
rise
he
left
the
room
and
with
a
heavy
heart
proceeded
to
look
for
helen
and
her
friend
though
he
would
gladly
have
prepared
himself
by
an
hour
of
solitude
for
communicating
tidings
which
had
very
nearly
overthrown
his
philosophy
but
he
had
promised
to
see
them
and
to
tell
them
all
that
passed
and
he
prepared
to
perform
this
promise
with
a
heavier
heart
than
had
ever
before
troubled
his
bosom
he
shrank
from
the
idea
of
appearing
before
rosalind
in
a
situation
so
miserably
humiliating
for
at
this
moment
fears
that
the
report
mentioned
by
lady
harrington
might
be
true
pressed
upon
him
and
though
his
better
judgment
told
him
that
such
feelings
were
contemptible
when
about
to
meet
the
eye
of
a
friend
he
could
not
subdue
them
and
as
he
opened
the
door
the
youthful
fire
of
his
eye
was
quenched
and
his
pale
lip
trembled
oh
charles
how
dreadfully
ill
you
look
exclaimed
helen
what
can
have
passed
said
miss
torrington
looking
almost
as
pale
himself
much
that
has
been
very
painful
he
replied
but
i
am
ashamed
at
being
thus
overpowered
by
it
tell
me
both
of
you
without
any
reserve
have
you
ever
thought
has
the
idea
ever
entered
your
heads
that
my
unfortunate
mother
was
likely
to
marry
cartwright
no
never
replied
helen
firmly
yes
said
rosalind
falteringly
but
less
with
the
hesitation
of
doubt
than
from
fear
of
giving
pain
lady
harrington
told
me
it
was
spoken
of
said
mowbray
with
a
deep
sigh
it
is
impossible
said
helen
i
can
not
i
will
not
believe
it
rosalind
if
you
have
had
such
an
idea
how
comes
it
that
you
have
kept
it
secret
from
me
if
instead
of
darkly
fearing
it
replied
rosalind
i
had
positively
known
it
to
be
true
i
doubt
if
i
should
have
named
it
helen
i
could
not
have
borne
that
words
so
hateful
should
have
first
reached
the
family
from
me
has
she
told
you
it
is
so
inquired
helen
her
lips
so
parched
with
agitation
that
she
pronounced
the
words
with
difficulty
no
dearest
she
has
not
and
perhaps
i
am
wrong
both
in
conceiving
such
an
idea
and
in
naming
it
but
her
mind
is
so
violently
so
strangely
wrought
upon
by
this
detestable
man
that
i
can
only
account
for
it
by
believing
that
he
is
there
was
much
filial
piety
in
the
feeling
that
prevented
his
finishing
the
sentence
it
is
so
that
i
have
reasoned
said
rosalind
heaven
grant
that
we
be
both
mistaken
but
will
you
not
tell
us
charles
what
it
is
that
has
suggested
the
idea
to
you
for
heaven
sake
relate
if
you
can
what
has
passed
between
you
if
i
can
indeed
i
doubt
my
power
she
spoke
of
me
as
of
one
condemned
of
heaven
rosalind
started
from
her
do
not
go
on
mr
mowbray
she
exclaimed
with
great
agitation
i
can
not
bear
this
and
meet
her
with
such
external
observance
and
civility
as
my
situation
demands
it
can
do
us
no
good
to
discuss
this
wicked
folly
this
most
sinful
madness
i
at
least
for
one
feel
a
degree
of
indignation
a
vehemence
of
irritation
on
the
subject
that
will
not
i
am
sure
produce
good
to
any
of
us
she
must
go
on
in
the
dreadful
path
in
which
she
has
lost
herself
till
she
meet
something
that
shall
shock
and
turn
her
back
again
but
all
that
can
be
done
or
said
by
others
will
but
drive
her
on
the
faster
adding
the
fervour
of
a
martyr
to
that
of
a
convert
you
speak
like
an
oracle
dear
rosalind
said
poor
mowbray
endeavouring
to
smile
and
more
relieved
than
he
would
have
avowed
to
himself
at
being
spared
the
task
of
narrating
his
downfall
from
supposed
wealth
to
actual
penury
before
her
she
speaks
like
an
oracle
but
a
very
sad
one
said
helen
nevertheless
we
will
listen
and
you
have
spoken
to
my
mother
and
what
you
have
said
has
produced
no
good
effect
to
me
therefore
it
is
quite
evident
that
nothing
can
were
it
not
that
the
fearful
use
which
we
hear
made
of
the
sacred
name
makes
me
tremble
lest
i
too
should
use
it
irreverently
i
would
express
the
confidence
i
feel
that
if
we
bear
this
heavy
sorrow
well
his
care
will
be
with
us
and
whether
we
say
it
or
not
let
us
feel
it
and
now
rosalind
we
must
redeem
our
lost
time
and
read
for
an
hour
or
so
upstairs
see
we
have
positively
let
the
fire
go
out
a
proof
how
extremely
injurious
it
is
to
permit
our
thoughts
to
fix
themselves
too
intensely
on
any
thing
it
renders
one
incapable
of
attending
to
the
necessary
affairs
of
there
charles
is
a
sermon
for
you
but
do
look
so
miserable
my
dear
brother
or
my
courage
will
melt
into
thin
air
i
will
do
my
best
to
master
it
helen
he
replied
but
i
shall
not
be
able
to
make
a
display
of
my
stoicism
before
you
this
evening
for
i
must
return
to
oakley
are
you
going
to
dine
there
why
did
you
not
tell
me
so
if
my
conversation
with
my
mother
had
ended
differently
helen
i
should
have
postponed
my
visit
till
but
as
it
is
it
will
be
better
for
me
to
go
now
i
will
drive
myself
over
in
the
cab
i
suppose
i
can
have
joseph
he
rang
the
bell
as
he
spoke
let
the
cab
be
got
ready
for
me
in
half
an
hour
and
tell
joseph
i
shall
want
him
to
go
out
with
me
to
dinner
the
cab
is
not
at
home
sir
replied
the
servant
is
it
gone
to
the
what
is
the
matter
with
it
there
is
nothing
the
matter
with
it
sir
but
cartwright
has
got
it
then
let
my
mare
be
saddled
she
is
in
the
stable
i
suppose
corbold
has
had
the
use
of
your
mare
charles
for
more
than
a
month
sir
and
terribly
worked
she
has
been
dick
says
very
well
it
no
matter
i
shall
walk
william
the
servant
retired
with
an
expression
of
more
sympathy
than
etiquette
could
warrant
helen
looked
at
her
brother
in
very
mournful
silence
but
tears
of
indignant
passion
started
to
the
bright
eyes
of
rosalind
is
there
no
remedy
for
all
this
she
exclaimed
helen
let
us
run
away
together
they
can
not
rob
me
of
my
money
i
suppose
do
ask
sir
gilbert
charles
if
i
am
obliged
to
stay
here
and
witness
these
hateful
i
will
i
will
miss
torrington
it
would
indeed
be
best
for
you
to
leave
us
but
my
poor
helen
she
must
stay
and
bear
it
then
i
shall
stay
too
and
that
i
think
you
might
guess
mr
mowbray
rosalind
tears
overflowed
as
she
spoke
and
charles
mowbray
looked
at
her
with
that
wringing
of
the
heart
which
arises
from
thinking
that
all
things
conspire
to
make
us
wretched
when
he
was
the
reputed
heir
of
fourteen
thousand
a
year
he
had
passed
whole
weeks
in
the
society
of
rosalind
and
never
dreamed
he
loved
her
but
now
now
that
he
was
a
beggar
and
a
beggar
too
as
it
seemed
not
very
likely
to
be
treated
with
much
charity
by
his
own
mother
now
that
it
would
be
infamy
to
turn
his
thoughts
towards
the
heiress
with
any
hope
or
wish
that
she
should
ever
be
his
he
felt
that
he
adored
her
that
every
hour
added
strength
to
a
passion
that
he
would
rather
die
than
reveal
and
that
without
a
guinea
in
the
world
to
take
him
or
to
keep
him
elsewhere
his
remaining
where
he
was
would
expose
him
to
sufferings
that
he
felt
he
had
no
strength
to
bear
chapter
xii
the
vicar
progress
and
his
counsel
to
fanny
as
to
the
best
means
of
assisting
the
poor
when
the
family
assembled
at
dinner
and
mowbray
perceived
the
place
of
her
son
vacant
she
changed
colour
and
appeared
discomposed
and
absent
during
the
whole
time
she
remained
at
table
this
however
was
not
long
for
a
very
few
minutes
after
the
cloth
was
removed
she
rose
and
saying
i
want
you
fanny
left
the
room
with
her
youngest
daughter
without
making
either
observation
or
apology
to
those
she
left
the
result
of
this
conference
between
the
mother
and
daughter
was
the
despatching
a
note
to
the
vicarage
which
brought
the
vicar
to
join
them
with
extraordinary
speed
mowbray
then
related
with
a
good
deal
of
emotion
the
scene
which
had
taken
place
between
herself
and
her
son
in
the
morning
concluding
it
with
mentioning
his
absence
at
dinner
and
her
fears
that
in
his
unregenerate
state
of
mind
he
might
be
led
to
withdraw
himself
altogether
from
a
home
where
godliness
had
begun
to
reign
and
where
by
the
blessing
of
heaven
it
would
multiply
and
increase
every
day
that
they
were
spared
to
live
when
she
had
concluded
cartwright
remained
for
several
minutes
silent
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
carpet
his
arms
folded
upon
his
breast
and
his
head
from
time
to
time
moved
gently
and
sadly
to
and
fro
as
if
the
subject
on
which
he
was
meditating
were
both
important
and
discouraging
at
length
he
raised
his
eyes
and
fixed
them
upon
fanny
my
dear
child
he
said
withdraw
yourself
and
pray
while
your
mother
and
i
remain
together
pray
for
us
fanny
pray
for
both
of
us
that
we
may
so
do
the
duty
appointed
unto
us
as
what
we
may
decide
to
execute
shall
redound
to
the
glory
of
heaven
and
to
our
everlasting
salvation
world
without
end
amen
fanny
rose
instantly
and
clasping
her
innocent
hands
together
fervently
exclaimed
i
will
i
will
having
opened
the
door
and
laid
his
delicate
white
hand
upon
her
head
whispering
an
ardent
blessing
as
she
passed
through
it
he
watched
her
as
she
retreated
with
a
rapid
step
to
her
chamber
anxious
to
perform
the
duty
assigned
her
and
then
closing
and
bolting
it
after
her
he
returned
to
the
sofa
near
the
fire
and
seated
himself
beside
mowbray
my
friend
said
cartwright
taking
her
hand
my
dear
dear
friend
you
are
tried
you
are
very
sorely
tried
but
it
is
the
will
of
the
lord
and
we
must
not
repine
at
it
rather
let
us
praise
his
name
alway
i
do
ejaculated
the
widow
with
very
pious
emotion
i
do
praise
and
bless
his
holy
name
for
all
the
salvation
he
hath
vouchsafed
to
me
a
sinner
and
to
my
precious
fanny
with
me
oh
cartwright
it
is
very
dear
to
me
to
think
that
i
shall
have
that
little
holy
angel
with
me
in
paradise
but
be
my
guide
and
helper
and
here
the
good
and
serious
lady
very
nearly
returned
the
pressure
with
which
her
hand
was
held
oh
be
my
guide
and
helper
with
my
other
misguided
children
tell
me
dear
cartwright
what
must
i
do
with
charles
it
is
borne
in
upon
my
mind
my
dear
and
gentle
friend
that
there
is
but
one
chance
left
to
save
that
soul
from
the
everlasting
gulf
of
gnawing
worms
and
of
eternal
flame
is
there
one
chance
exclaimed
the
poor
woman
in
a
real
ecstasy
oh
tell
me
what
it
is
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
wide
world
that
i
would
not
bear
and
suffer
to
obtain
it
he
must
abandon
the
profession
of
arms
and
become
a
minister
of
the
gospel
oh
cartwright
he
never
will
consent
to
this
from
his
earliest
childhood
his
unhappy
and
unawakened
father
taught
him
to
glory
in
the
thought
of
fighting
the
battles
of
his
country
and
with
the
large
fortune
he
must
one
day
have
is
it
not
probable
that
he
might
be
tempted
to
neglect
the
cure
of
souls
and
then
you
know
cartwright
that
the
last
state
of
that
man
would
be
worse
than
the
first
cartwright
dropped
the
lady
hand
and
rose
from
his
seat
i
must
leave
you
then
he
said
his
rich
voice
sinking
into
a
tone
of
the
saddest
melancholy
i
must
not
i
may
not
give
any
other
counsel
for
in
doing
so
i
should
betray
my
duty
and
betray
the
confidence
you
have
placed
in
me
adieu
then
beloved
friend
adieu
for
ever
my
heart
the
weak
and
throbbing
heart
of
a
man
is
even
now
heaving
in
my
breast
that
heart
will
for
ever
forbid
my
speaking
with
harshness
and
austerity
to
you
therefore
beloved
but
too
feeble
friend
adieu
should
i
stay
longer
with
you
that
look
might
betray
me
into
forgetfulness
of
every
thing
on
earth
and
heaven
too
the
three
last
words
were
uttered
in
a
low
and
mournful
whisper
he
then
walked
towards
the
door
turned
to
give
one
last
look
and
having
unfastened
the
lock
and
shot
back
the
bolt
was
in
the
very
act
of
departing
when
mowbray
rushed
towards
him
exclaiming
oh
do
not
leave
us
all
to
everlasting
damnation
save
us
save
us
tell
me
only
what
to
do
and
i
will
do
it
in
the
extremity
of
her
eagerness
terror
and
emotion
she
fell
on
her
knees
before
him
and
raising
her
tearful
eyes
to
his
seemed
silently
to
reiterate
the
petition
she
had
uttered
cartwright
looked
down
upon
her
turned
away
for
one
short
instant
to
rebolt
the
door
and
then
raising
his
eyes
to
heaven
and
dropping
on
his
knees
beside
her
he
threw
his
arms
around
her
impressed
a
holy
kiss
upon
her
brow
exclaiming
in
a
voice
rendered
tremulous
as
it
should
seem
by
uncontrollable
agitation
oh
never
never
after
a
few
moments
unavoidably
lost
by
both
in
efforts
to
recover
their
equanimity
they
rose
and
reseated
themselves
on
the
sofa
the
handkerchief
of
mowbray
was
at
her
eyes
she
appeared
greatly
agitated
and
totally
unable
to
speak
herself
sat
in
trembling
expectation
of
what
her
reverend
friend
should
say
next
it
was
not
immediately
however
that
cartwright
could
recover
his
voice
but
at
length
he
said
it
is
impossible
my
too
lovely
friend
that
we
can
either
of
us
any
longer
mistake
the
nature
of
the
sentiment
which
we
feel
for
each
other
but
we
have
the
comfort
of
knowing
that
this
sweet
and
blessed
sentiment
is
implanted
in
us
by
the
will
of
the
lord
and
if
it
be
sanctified
to
his
honour
and
glory
it
becometh
the
means
of
raising
us
to
glory
everlasting
in
the
life
to
come
wherefore
let
us
not
weep
and
lament
but
rather
be
joyful
and
give
thanks
that
so
it
hath
seemed
good
in
his
sight
mowbray
answered
only
by
a
deep
sigh
which
partook
indeed
of
the
nature
of
a
sob
and
by
the
continued
application
of
her
handkerchief
it
appeared
that
she
wept
freely
cartwright
once
more
ventured
to
take
her
hand
and
that
she
did
not
withdraw
it
seemed
to
evince
such
a
degree
of
christian
humility
and
such
a
forgiveness
of
his
presumption
that
the
pious
feelings
of
his
heart
broke
forth
in
thanksgiving
praise
and
glory
to
the
lord
alway
he
exclaimed
your
suffering
sweetness
dearest
clara
loveliest
of
women
most
your
suffering
sweetness
shall
be
bruised
no
more
let
me
henceforward
be
as
the
shield
and
buckler
that
shall
guard
thee
so
that
thou
shalt
not
be
afraid
for
any
terror
by
night
nor
for
the
arrow
that
flieth
by
day
and
tell
me
most
beloved
does
not
thy
spirit
rejoice
and
is
not
thy
heart
glad
even
as
my
heart
that
the
lord
hath
been
pleased
to
lay
his
holy
law
upon
us
even
upon
thee
and
me
oh
mr
cartwright
replied
the
agitated
mowbray
i
know
not
what
i
can
i
know
not
what
i
ought
to
do
may
heaven
guide
me
for
alas
i
know
not
how
to
guide
myself
and
fear
not
clara
but
he
will
guide
thee
for
he
hath
made
thee
but
a
little
lower
than
the
angels
and
hath
crowned
thee
with
glory
and
honour
and
tell
me
thou
one
doth
not
thy
own
heart
teach
thee
that
heart
being
taught
of
him
that
i
am
he
to
whom
thou
shouldst
look
for
comfort
now
in
the
time
of
this
mortal
life
speak
to
me
sweet
and
holy
clara
tell
me
am
i
deceived
in
thee
or
art
thou
indeed
and
wilt
thou
indeed
be
mine
if
i
shall
sin
not
by
doing
so
i
will
cartwright
for
my
spirit
is
too
weak
to
combat
all
the
difficulties
i
see
before
me
my
soul
trusts
itself
to
thee
be
thou
to
me
a
strong
tower
for
i
am
afraid
think
you
clara
that
he
who
has
led
you
out
of
darkness
into
the
way
of
life
would
now
for
the
gratification
of
his
own
earthly
love
become
a
in
thy
path
my
beloved
friend
how
are
you
to
wrestle
and
fight
for
and
with
that
misguided
young
man
who
hath
now
even
now
caused
you
such
bitter
sufferings
he
is
thine
therefore
he
is
dear
to
me
let
me
lead
him
even
as
i
have
led
thee
and
his
spirit
too
as
well
as
thine
and
fanny
shall
rejoice
then
be
it
so
exclaimed
mowbray
promise
me
only
to
lead
helen
also
into
life
everlasting
and
not
to
leave
the
poor
benighted
rosalind
for
ever
in
darkness
and
i
will
consent
cartwright
to
be
your
wife
nothing
could
be
more
satisfactory
than
the
vicar
answer
to
this
appeal
and
had
not
the
good
mowbray
been
too
generous
to
exact
a
penalty
in
case
of
failure
there
can
be
little
doubt
but
that
he
would
willingly
have
bound
himself
under
any
forfeiture
she
could
have
named
to
have
ensured
a
place
in
heaven
not
only
to
all
those
she
mentioned
but
to
every
individual
of
her
household
the
scullion
and
included
the
great
question
answered
of
to
be
or
not
to
be
the
husband
of
mrs
mowbray
the
vicar
began
to
point
out
to
her
in
a
more
composed
and
manner
the
great
advantages
both
temporal
and
spiritual
which
must
of
necessity
result
to
her
family
from
this
arrangement
and
so
skilfully
did
he
manage
her
feelings
and
bend
her
mind
to
his
purpose
that
when
at
length
he
gave
her
lips
the
farewell
kiss
of
affianced
love
and
departed
he
left
her
in
the
most
comfortable
and
prayerful
state
of
composure
imaginable
in
about
ten
minutes
after
he
was
gone
she
rang
her
bell
and
desired
that
miss
fanny
might
come
to
her
when
without
exactly
telling
her
the
important
business
which
had
been
settled
during
the
time
she
passed
upon
her
knees
she
gave
her
to
understand
that
cartwright
had
probably
thought
of
the
only
means
by
which
all
the
unhappy
disagreements
in
the
family
could
be
settled
indeed
mamma
i
prayed
for
him
said
fanny
lifting
her
eyes
to
heaven
i
prayed
most
earnestly
that
heaven
might
bring
him
wisdom
to
succour
you
according
to
your
wish
and
therein
to
heal
all
our
troubles
and
your
prayers
have
been
heard
my
dear
child
and
it
hath
sent
him
the
wisdom
that
we
all
so
greatly
have
they
had
tea
in
the
fanny
i
do
know
mamma
i
have
been
kneeling
and
praying
all
the
time
then
my
dear
you
must
want
refreshment
go
down
and
tell
them
that
i
am
not
quite
well
this
evening
and
shall
therefore
not
come
down
again
but
they
may
send
me
some
tea
by
curtis
i
hope
you
are
not
very
ill
my
dearest
mother
said
fanny
looking
anxiously
at
her
no
dear
not
very
ill
only
a
little
nervous
while
these
scenes
passed
at
mowbray
park
poor
charles
was
relieving
his
heart
by
relating
without
reserve
what
had
passed
between
him
and
his
mother
his
first
words
on
entering
the
library
where
sir
gilbert
and
lady
harrington
were
seated
were
have
you
sent
that
letter
to
oxford
sir
gilbert
yes
i
have
was
the
reply
but
why
do
you
inquire
charles
because
if
you
had
not
i
would
have
begged
you
to
delay
it
and
why
so
in
reply
to
this
question
young
mowbray
told
all
that
had
passed
observing
when
his
painful
tale
was
ended
that
such
being
his
decision
he
intended
to
apply
immediately
to
corbold
for
the
money
he
wanted
not
you
by
jove
charles
you
shall
do
no
such
thing
i
tell
you
what
knuckle
and
truckle
to
this
infernal
gang
of
hypocrites
you
shall
do
no
such
thing
just
let
me
know
all
that
is
going
on
in
the
garrison
and
if
i
do
counterplot
them
i
am
a
dutchman
puff
not
up
your
heart
sir
knight
with
such
vain
conceits
said
lady
harrington
you
will
plot
like
an
honest
man
and
the
tartuffe
will
plot
like
a
rogue
i
leave
you
to
guess
which
will
do
the
most
work
in
the
shortest
time
nevertheless
you
are
right
to
keep
him
out
of
the
way
of
these
people
as
long
as
you
can
notwithstanding
the
heavy
load
at
his
heart
which
mowbray
brought
with
him
to
oakley
before
he
had
passed
an
hour
with
his
old
friends
his
sorrows
appeared
lighter
and
his
hopes
from
the
future
brighter
and
stronger
sir
gilbert
though
exceedingly
angry
with
mowbray
still
retained
some
respect
for
her
and
spite
of
all
his
threatening
hints
to
the
contrary
he
no
more
believed
that
the
widow
of
his
old
friend
would
marry
herself
to
the
reverend
william
jacob
cartwright
than
that
he
when
left
a
widower
by
my
lady
should
marry
the
drunken
landlady
of
the
three
tankards
at
ramsden
he
therefore
spoke
to
charles
of
his
present
vexatious
embarrassments
as
of
all
evils
that
must
naturally
clear
away
requiring
only
a
little
temporary
good
management
to
render
them
of
very
small
importance
to
him
of
helen
situation
however
lady
harrington
spoke
with
great
concern
and
proposed
that
she
and
miss
torrington
should
transfer
themselves
from
the
park
to
oakley
as
soon
as
charles
joined
his
regiment
and
there
remain
till
mowbray
had
sufficiently
recovered
her
senses
to
make
them
comfortable
at
home
before
the
young
man
left
them
it
was
settled
that
colonel
harrington
should
immediately
exert
himself
to
obtain
the
commission
so
long
promised
a
service
in
the
performance
of
which
no
difficulty
was
anticipated
as
the
last
inquiries
made
on
the
subject
at
the
horse
guards
were
satisfactorily
answered
meanwhile
said
the
baronet
as
he
wrung
his
hand
at
parting
give
not
way
for
one
single
inch
before
the
insolent
interference
of
these
canters
and
ranters
remember
who
and
what
you
are
and
that
you
have
a
friend
who
will
make
the
county
too
hot
to
hold
any
one
male
or
female
who
shall
attempt
to
shake
or
shackle
you
in
your
natural
rights
treat
your
mother
with
the
most
perfect
respect
and
politeness
but
make
her
understand
that
you
are
your
father
son
and
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
public
opinion
which
on
more
occasions
than
one
has
been
found
as
powerful
as
any
other
law
of
the
land
cheer
the
spirits
of
the
poor
girls
as
much
as
you
can
and
tell
helen
that
her
duty
to
her
father
memory
requires
that
she
should
not
neglect
her
friends
and
now
good
night
charles
come
to
us
as
often
as
you
can
and
god
bless
you
my
dear
boy
by
this
advice
young
mowbray
determined
to
act
and
wishing
to
escape
any
discussion
upon
lesser
points
he
avoided
all
conversations
with
his
mother
kept
as
much
out
of
cartwright
way
as
possible
turned
his
back
upon
the
serious
attorney
whenever
he
met
him
and
devoted
his
time
to
walking
reading
and
singing
with
miss
torrington
and
his
sister
helen
while
waiting
to
receive
the
news
of
his
appointment
when
this
should
arrive
he
determined
once
more
to
see
his
mother
in
private
and
settle
with
her
on
the
best
footing
he
could
the
amount
and
manner
of
his
future
supplies
this
interval
which
lasted
nearly
a
month
was
by
no
means
an
unhappy
one
to
charles
he
had
great
confidence
in
the
judgment
of
sir
gilbert
harrington
and
being
much
more
inclined
to
believe
in
his
affection
than
to
doubt
it
he
resolutely
shut
his
eyes
upon
whatever
was
likely
to
annoy
him
and
gave
himself
up
to
that
occupation
which
beyond
all
others
enables
a
man
or
a
woman
either
to
overlook
and
forget
every
other
namely
the
making
love
from
morning
to
night
the
manner
in
which
this
undeclared
but
very
intelligible
devotion
of
the
heart
was
received
by
the
fair
object
of
it
was
such
perhaps
as
to
justify
hope
though
it
by
no
means
afforded
any
certainty
that
the
feeling
was
returned
even
helen
who
fully
possessed
her
confidence
and
had
hitherto
as
she
believed
fully
possessed
the
confidence
of
rosalind
also
even
helen
knew
not
very
well
what
to
make
of
the
varying
symptoms
which
her
friend
heart
betrayed
that
miss
torrington
took
great
pleasure
in
the
society
of
mowbray
it
was
impossible
to
doubt
and
that
she
wished
him
to
find
pleasure
in
hers
was
equally
clear
his
favourite
songs
only
were
those
which
she
practised
in
his
absence
and
sang
in
his
presence
he
rarely
praised
a
passage
in
their
daily
readings
which
she
might
not
by
means
of
a
little
watching
be
found
to
have
read
again
within
the
next
hours
the
feeble
from
the
conservatory
of
which
he
made
her
a
daily
offering
might
be
seen
preserved
on
her
toilet
in
a
succession
of
glasses
and
only
removed
at
length
by
a
remonstrance
from
her
maid
who
assured
her
that
stale
flowers
were
unwholesome
though
to
be
sure
coming
out
of
that
elegant
conservatory
did
make
a
difference
no
doubt
yet
even
then
the
bouquet
of
a
week
old
was
not
permitted
to
make
its
exit
till
some
aromatic
leaf
or
still
green
sprig
of
myrtle
had
been
drawn
from
it
and
deposited
somewhere
or
other
where
its
pretty
mistress
perhaps
never
saw
it
more
but
which
nevertheless
prevented
her
feeling
that
she
had
thrown
the
flowers
he
had
given
her
on
sunday
in
the
or
on
monday
in
the
quite
away
yet
with
all
this
it
was
quite
impossible
that
charles
or
even
helen
who
knew
more
of
these
little
symptomatic
whims
than
he
did
could
feel
at
all
sure
what
rosalind
answer
would
be
if
mowbray
made
her
a
proposal
of
marriage
from
time
to
time
words
dropped
from
rosalind
indicative
of
her
extreme
disapprobation
of
early
marriages
both
for
women
and
men
and
declaring
that
there
was
nothing
she
should
dread
so
much
as
forming
a
union
for
life
with
a
man
too
young
to
know
his
own
mind
when
asked
by
charles
at
what
age
she
conceived
it
likely
that
a
man
might
attain
this
very
necessary
she
answered
with
a
marked
emphasis
decidedly
not
till
they
are
many
years
older
than
you
are
mr
mowbray
even
to
her
own
heart
rosalind
would
at
this
time
have
positively
denied
not
only
that
she
loved
charles
mowbray
but
that
charles
mowbray
loved
her
she
was
neither
insensible
nor
indifferent
to
his
admiration
or
to
the
pleasure
he
took
in
her
society
but
she
had
heard
charles
judgment
of
her
on
her
arrival
more
than
once
repeated
in
jest
he
had
said
that
she
was
neither
so
amiable
as
helen
nor
so
handsome
as
fanny
to
both
of
these
opinions
she
most
sincerely
subscribed
and
with
such
simple
and
undoubting
acquiescence
that
it
was
only
when
she
began
to
read
in
his
eyes
the
legible
i
love
you
that
she
remembered
his
having
said
it
then
her
woman
heart
told
her
that
inferior
though
she
might
be
it
was
not
her
husband
that
must
be
the
first
to
discover
it
and
superior
as
he
was
which
she
certainly
was
not
disposed
to
deny
it
was
not
with
such
disproportionate
excellence
that
she
should
be
most
likely
to
form
a
happy
union
had
mowbray
guessed
how
grave
and
in
rosalind
mind
were
the
reasons
which
would
have
led
her
decidedly
to
refuse
him
this
flowery
portion
of
his
existence
would
have
lost
all
its
sweetness
it
was
therefore
favourable
to
his
present
enjoyment
that
confident
as
he
felt
of
ultimately
possessing
the
fortune
to
which
he
was
born
he
determined
not
to
propose
to
rosalind
till
his
mother
had
consented
to
assure
to
him
an
independence
as
undoubted
as
her
own
the
sweet
vapour
of
hope
therefore
the
incense
with
which
young
hearts
salute
the
morning
of
life
enveloped
him
on
all
sides
and
pity
is
it
that
the
mist
should
ever
be
blown
away
from
those
who
like
him
are
better
as
well
as
happier
for
the
halo
that
so
surrounds
them
many
a
storm
is
preceded
by
a
calm
many
a
gay
and
happy
hour
only
gives
the
frightful
force
of
contrast
to
the
misery
that
follows
it
cartwright
having
once
and
again
received
the
plighted
faith
of
mowbray
for
the
present
confined
his
operations
solely
to
the
gentle
task
of
urging
her
to
hasten
his
happiness
and
the
assurance
of
eternal
salvation
to
all
her
family
but
here
though
the
obstacles
he
had
to
encounter
were
of
a
soft
and
malleable
nature
easily
yielding
to
the
touch
and
giving
way
at
one
point
they
were
yet
difficult
to
get
rid
of
altogether
for
they
were
sure
to
swell
up
like
dough
and
meet
him
again
in
another
place
thus
when
he
proved
to
the
pious
widow
that
heaven
could
never
wish
her
to
delay
her
marriage
till
her
year
of
mourning
was
out
seeing
that
its
honour
and
glory
would
be
so
greatly
benefited
and
increased
thereby
she
first
agreed
perfectly
in
his
view
of
the
case
as
so
put
but
immediately
placed
before
him
the
violent
odium
which
they
should
have
to
endure
from
the
opinion
of
the
world
and
then
when
his
eloquence
had
convinced
her
that
it
was
sinful
for
those
who
put
not
their
faith
in
princes
nor
in
any
child
of
man
to
regulate
their
conduct
by
such
worldly
considerations
though
she
confessed
to
him
that
as
their
future
associations
would
of
course
be
wholly
and
solely
among
the
elect
she
might
perhaps
overcome
her
fear
of
what
her
neighbours
and
unregenerate
acquaintance
might
say
yet
nevertheless
she
doubted
if
she
could
find
courage
to
send
orders
to
her
milliner
and
dressmaker
for
coloured
suits
even
of
a
sober
and
religious
tint
as
it
was
so
very
short
a
time
since
she
had
ordered
her
it
was
more
difficult
perhaps
to
push
this
last
difficulty
aside
than
any
other
for
cartwright
could
not
immediately
see
how
to
bring
the
great
doctrine
of
salvation
to
bear
upon
it
however
though
the
lady
had
not
yet
been
prevailed
upon
to
fix
the
day
and
even
at
intervals
still
spoke
of
the
eligibility
of
waiting
till
the
year
of
mourning
was
ended
yet
on
the
whole
he
had
no
cause
to
complain
of
the
terms
on
which
he
stood
with
her
and
very
wisely
permitted
the
peace
of
mind
which
he
himself
enjoyed
to
diffuse
itself
benignly
over
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
park
and
the
vicarage
henrietta
who
throughout
the
winter
had
been
in
too
delicate
a
state
of
health
to
venture
out
of
the
house
was
permitted
to
read
what
books
she
liked
at
the
corner
of
the
parlour
fire
while
jacob
far
from
being
annoyed
by
any
particular
strictness
of
domestic
discipline
became
extremely
like
the
wind
which
bloweth
where
it
listeth
wandering
from
to
nay
even
from
village
to
village
without
restriction
of
any
kind
from
his
father
fanny
however
was
neither
overlooked
nor
neglected
though
to
have
now
led
her
about
to
little
in
the
woods
was
impossible
first
the
wintry
season
forbad
it
and
secondly
the
very
particular
and
important
discussions
which
business
rendered
necessary
in
mowbray
or
as
it
had
lately
been
designated
mowbray
morning
parlour
must
have
made
such
an
occupation
as
difficult
as
dangerous
at
these
discussions
fanny
was
never
invited
to
appear
she
prayed
in
company
with
her
mother
and
cartwright
and
some
of
the
most
promising
of
the
domestics
for
an
hour
in
the
morning
and
an
hour
in
the
evening
but
the
manner
in
which
the
interval
between
these
two
prayings
was
spent
showed
very
considerable
tact
and
discrimination
of
character
in
the
vicar
of
wrexhill
soon
after
the
important
interview
which
has
been
stated
to
have
taken
place
between
the
lady
of
the
manor
and
the
vicar
had
occurred
cartwright
having
met
fanny
on
the
stairs
in
his
way
to
her
morning
parlour
asked
her
with
even
more
than
his
usual
tender
kindness
whether
he
might
not
be
admitted
for
a
few
minutes
into
her
study
for
it
was
thus
that
was
now
called
by
as
many
of
the
household
as
made
a
point
of
doing
every
thing
that
cartwright
recommended
oh
yes
she
replied
with
all
the
zealous
piety
which
distinguishes
the
sect
to
which
she
belonged
whenever
their
consent
is
asked
to
do
or
suffer
any
thing
that
nobody
else
would
think
it
proper
to
do
or
suffer
oh
yes
will
you
come
now
mr
cartwright
yes
my
dear
child
it
is
now
that
i
wish
to
come
and
in
another
moment
the
vicar
of
wrexhill
and
his
beautiful
young
parishioner
were
sitting
on
the
sofa
of
the
young
lady
as
usual
with
him
on
all
such
occasions
he
took
her
hand
fanny
he
began
dear
precious
fanny
you
know
not
how
much
of
my
attention
how
many
of
my
thoughts
are
devoted
to
you
oh
cartwright
how
very
very
kind
you
are
to
think
of
me
at
all
you
must
listen
to
me
fanny
he
still
retained
her
hand
you
must
now
listen
to
me
with
very
great
attention
you
know
i
think
highly
of
your
abilities
indeed
i
have
not
scrupled
to
tell
you
it
was
my
opinion
that
the
lord
had
endowed
you
with
great
powers
for
his
own
especial
service
and
glory
that
last
hymn
fanny
confirms
and
strengthens
me
in
this
blessed
belief
and
i
look
upon
you
as
a
chosen
vessel
but
my
child
we
must
be
careful
that
we
use
and
not
abuse
this
exceeding
great
mercy
and
honour
your
verses
fanny
are
sweet
to
my
ear
as
the
songs
of
the
children
of
israel
to
those
who
were
carried
away
captive
but
not
for
me
not
for
me
alone
or
for
those
who
like
me
can
taste
the
ecstasy
inspired
by
holy
song
has
that
power
been
given
unto
you
the
poor
the
needy
those
of
no
account
in
the
reckoning
of
the
proud
they
have
all
my
dearest
fanny
a
right
to
share
in
the
precious
gift
bestowed
on
you
wherefore
i
am
now
about
to
propose
to
you
a
work
to
which
the
best
and
the
holiest
devote
their
lives
but
on
which
you
have
never
yet
tried
your
young
strength
i
mean
my
dearest
child
the
writing
of
tracts
for
the
poor
oh
cartwright
do
you
really
think
it
possible
that
i
can
be
useful
in
such
a
blessed
way
i
am
sure
you
may
my
dear
fanny
and
you
know
this
will
be
the
means
of
doing
good
both
to
the
souls
and
bodies
of
the
saints
for
what
you
shall
write
will
not
only
be
read
to
the
edification
and
salvation
of
many
christian
souls
but
will
be
printed
and
sold
for
the
benefit
either
of
the
poor
and
needy
or
for
the
furthering
such
works
and
undertakings
as
it
may
be
deemed
most
fit
to
patronise
and
assist
oh
cartwright
if
i
could
be
useful
in
such
a
way
as
that
i
should
be
very
thankful
only
i
have
a
doubt
here
the
bright
countenance
of
fanny
became
suddenly
overclouded
she
even
trembled
and
turned
pale
what
is
it
my
dear
child
that
affects
you
thus
said
the
vicar
with
real
surprise
tell
me
my
sweet
fanny
what
i
have
said
to
alarm
you
if
i
do
this
said
fanny
her
voice
faltering
with
timidity
shall
i
not
seem
to
be
trusting
to
works
do
you
mean
because
the
writings
of
authors
are
called
their
works
said
cartwright
very
gravely
no
mr
cartwright
she
replied
colouring
from
the
feeling
that
if
so
good
and
holy
a
man
could
quiz
she
should
imagine
that
he
was
now
quizzing
her
no
mr
cartwright
but
if
i
do
this
and
trust
to
get
saving
grace
as
a
reward
for
the
good
i
may
do
will
not
this
be
trusting
to
works
my
dear
child
he
said
gently
kissing
her
forehead
such
tenderness
of
conscience
is
the
best
assurance
that
what
you
will
do
will
be
done
in
a
right
spirit
then
fear
not
dear
fanny
that
those
things
which
prove
a
snare
to
the
unbeliever
should
in
like
manner
prove
a
snare
to
the
elect
again
fanny
mowbray
trembled
alas
then
i
may
still
risk
the
danger
of
eternal
fire
by
this
thing
for
am
i
of
the
elect
the
vicar
knew
that
mowbray
was
waiting
for
him
and
fearing
that
this
long
delay
might
have
a
strange
appearance
he
hastily
concluded
the
conversation
by
exclaiming
with
as
much
vehemence
as
brevity
you
are
you
are
chapter
xiii
simpson
charitable
charles
troubles
continue
from
this
time
most
of
fanny
mowbray
hours
were
spent
in
writing
tracts
which
as
soon
as
completed
were
delivered
to
cartwright
he
received
them
ever
with
expressions
of
mingled
admiration
and
gratitude
constantly
assuring
her
the
next
time
they
met
that
nothing
could
be
more
admirably
calculated
to
answer
the
effect
intended
and
that
the
last
was
incomparably
superior
to
all
which
had
preceded
it
this
occupation
of
writing
tracts
first
hit
upon
for
the
convenient
occupation
of
fanny
mowbray
was
soon
converted
by
the
ready
wit
of
cartwright
into
an
occupation
in
one
way
or
another
for
all
the
professing
christians
in
his
parish
who
happened
to
have
nothing
to
do
those
who
are
at
all
acquainted
with
the
manner
in
which
the
church
methodists
as
they
are
called
obtain
the
unbounded
influence
which
they
are
known
to
possess
in
their
different
parishes
particularly
over
the
female
part
of
their
congregations
must
be
aware
that
great
and
violent
as
the
effect
of
their
passionate
extempore
preaching
often
is
it
is
not
to
that
alone
that
they
trust
for
obtaining
it
from
the
time
cartwright
became
vicar
of
wrexhill
he
had
been
unremitting
in
his
exertions
of
every
kind
to
obtain
power
influence
and
dominion
throughout
the
parish
and
on
the
whole
had
been
pretty
generally
successful
how
far
his
handsome
person
and
pleasing
address
contributed
to
this
it
is
not
here
necessary
to
inquire
but
it
is
certain
that
he
drew
upon
these
advantages
largely
in
his
intercourse
with
the
females
in
general
and
with
the
ladies
in
particular
but
though
at
first
this
particular
species
of
devotion
was
exceedingly
agreeable
to
him
both
in
its
exercise
and
its
success
he
now
found
very
considerable
inconvenience
from
the
difficulty
of
keeping
up
the
frequency
of
his
pastoral
visits
to
his
fair
converts
without
giving
more
time
to
them
than
was
consistent
with
his
infinitely
more
important
avocations
at
the
park
as
soon
however
as
he
perceived
how
completely
the
writing
of
tracts
occupied
fanny
mowbray
during
the
time
that
was
formerly
bestowed
upon
listening
to
his
sentimental
divinity
he
determined
that
several
others
of
his
female
parishioners
should
dispose
of
their
superfluous
time
in
the
same
manner
within
hours
after
he
came
to
this
decision
the
three
misses
richards
had
each
and
every
of
them
purchased
a
quire
of
foolscap
paper
a
quarter
of
a
hundred
of
with
a
bottle
of
ink
and
a
concordance
in
common
between
them
miss
stokes
too
the
little
milliner
and
knighton
the
late
widow
and
watkins
the
haberdasher
wife
were
all
furnished
with
abundant
materials
of
the
same
value
and
all
of
them
determined
to
give
up
every
earthly
thing
if
it
were
necessary
rather
than
disappoint
the
dear
blessed
cartwright
of
the
comfort
of
receiving
any
thing
he
expected
from
them
the
widow
simpson
and
even
her
little
holy
mimima
had
also
employment
found
for
them
which
though
it
could
but
ill
supply
to
that
regenerate
lady
the
loss
of
cartwright
society
which
at
this
particular
time
she
was
in
a
great
degree
deprived
of
served
nevertheless
to
soothe
her
by
the
conviction
that
though
not
seen
she
was
remembered
the
part
of
the
business
consigned
to
simpson
was
the
selling
the
tracts
it
was
not
without
surprise
that
the
people
of
the
neighbourhood
particularly
the
unawakened
saw
the
of
the
principal
person
in
the
village
disfigured
by
a
large
square
paper
looking
very
much
as
if
it
announced
lodgings
to
let
but
which
upon
closer
examination
proved
to
be
inscribed
as
follows
religious
tracts
hymns
and
meditations
sold
here
at
one
penny
each
or
ninepence
halfpenny
for
the
dozen
miss
mimima
duty
was
to
hold
in
her
hand
a
square
box
with
a
slit
cut
in
the
lid
thereof
in
which
all
who
purchased
the
tracts
were
requested
to
deposit
their
money
for
the
same
and
when
the
customer
appearance
betokened
the
possession
of
more
pennies
than
their
purchase
required
the
little
girl
was
instructed
to
say
one
more
penny
please
or
sir
for
the
love
of
the
lord
thus
for
the
pleasant
interval
of
a
few
weeks
every
thing
went
on
smoothly
helen
at
the
earnest
request
of
her
brother
and
convinced
by
his
arguments
as
well
as
those
of
lady
harrington
and
rosalind
that
under
existing
circumstances
it
was
right
to
do
so
made
several
morning
visits
to
oakley
had
she
been
questioned
concerning
this
she
would
most
frankly
have
avowed
both
the
act
and
the
motives
for
it
but
no
such
questionings
came
charles
himself
dined
there
repeatedly
but
was
never
asked
why
he
absented
himself
nor
where
he
had
been
during
this
period
mowbray
seemed
to
encourage
rather
more
than
usual
the
intercourse
of
the
family
with
their
wrexhill
neighbours
the
season
being
no
longer
favourable
for
walking
the
mowbray
carriage
was
to
be
seen
two
or
three
times
in
a
week
at
simpson
richards
and
the
vicarage
but
it
often
happened
that
though
mowbray
proposed
a
visit
to
wrexhill
while
they
were
at
the
and
that
the
coachman
immediately
received
orders
to
be
at
the
door
accordingly
when
the
time
arrived
her
inclination
for
the
excursion
was
found
to
have
evaporated
and
the
young
people
went
thither
alone
upon
one
occasion
of
this
kind
when
fanny
being
deeply
engaged
in
the
composition
of
a
tract
and
charles
gone
to
oakley
miss
torrington
and
helen
had
the
carriage
to
themselves
they
agreed
that
instead
of
making
the
proposed
visit
to
simpson
they
should
go
to
inquire
for
a
little
patient
of
helen
the
child
of
a
poor
woman
who
had
long
been
one
of
her
pensioners
at
wrexhill
the
entrance
to
the
house
was
by
a
side
door
from
a
lane
too
narrow
to
permit
the
carriage
to
turn
the
two
young
ladies
therefore
were
put
down
at
the
corner
of
it
and
their
approach
was
unheard
by
those
who
occupied
the
room
upon
which
the
door
of
the
house
opened
although
it
stood
ajar
but
as
they
were
in
the
very
act
of
entering
they
were
stopped
by
words
so
loud
and
angry
that
they
felt
disposed
to
turn
back
and
abandon
their
charitable
intention
altogether
but
rosalind
ear
caught
a
sound
that
made
her
curious
to
hear
more
and
laying
her
hand
on
helen
arm
and
at
the
same
time
making
a
sign
that
she
should
be
silent
they
stood
for
a
moment
on
the
threshold
that
they
might
decide
whether
to
retreat
or
advance
you
nasty
abominable
woman
you
these
were
the
first
words
which
distinctly
reached
them
you
nasty
untidy
creature
look
at
the
do
all
splashed
out
upon
the
ground
how
can
you
expect
a
christian
lady
who
is
the
principal
person
in
the
parish
to
come
and
look
after
your
nasty
dirty
soul
you
untidy
pig
you
lord
love
you
my
lady
is
downright
unpossible
to
keep
one
little
room
neat
and
fit
for
the
like
of
you
when
i
have
the
washing
of
three
families
to
do
in
heaven
be
praised
for
it
and
to
cook
my
husband
bit
of
dinner
and
let
three
little
ones
crawl
about
in
it
besides
stuff
and
nonsense
responded
the
principal
person
in
the
village
whoever
heard
of
washing
making
people
dirty
look
here
put
out
your
hand
ca
you
i
am
sure
i
shall
come
no
nearer
to
you
and
your
tub
take
these
three
tracts
and
take
care
you
expound
them
to
your
husband
and
remember
that
you
are
to
bring
them
back
again
in
one
month
without
a
single
speck
of
dirt
upon
them
you
be
sent
by
the
new
vicar
beant
you
madam
simpson
inquired
the
woman
sent
woman
i
do
know
what
you
mean
by
as
a
friend
and
joint
labourer
with
cartwright
in
the
vineyard
i
am
come
to
take
your
soul
out
of
the
nethermost
pit
but
if
you
will
persist
in
going
on
soaping
and
rubbing
at
that
rate
instead
of
listening
to
me
i
do
see
that
you
have
any
more
chance
of
salvation
than
your
black
kettle
there
mercy
on
me
i
shall
catch
my
death
of
cold
here
tell
me
at
once
do
you
undertake
to
expound
these
tracts
to
your
husband
dear
me
no
my
lady
i
was
brought
up
altogether
to
the
washing
line
what
has
that
to
do
with
it
you
stupid
sinner
i
ca
stay
any
longer
in
this
horrid
damp
windy
hole
but
take
care
that
you
expound
for
i
insist
upon
it
and
if
you
do
you
may
depend
upon
it
cartwright
wo
give
you
one
penny
of
the
sacrament
money
so
saying
the
pious
lady
turned
away
and
opened
the
door
upon
miss
torrington
and
helen
conscious
perhaps
that
her
had
not
been
performed
in
so
a
manner
as
it
might
have
been
had
she
known
that
any
portion
of
the
park
family
were
within
hearing
the
principal
person
in
the
village
started
and
coloured
at
seeing
them
but
aware
how
greatly
she
had
outrun
the
two
young
ladies
in
the
heavenly
race
she
immediately
recovered
herself
and
said
i
am
afraid
young
ladies
that
your
errand
here
is
not
the
same
as
mine
betty
thomas
is
a
poor
sinful
creature
and
i
hope
you
are
not
going
to
give
her
money
till
she
is
reported
elect
miss
mowbray
it
will
really
be
no
less
than
a
sin
if
you
do
she
has
a
sick
child
simpson
replied
helen
and
i
am
going
to
give
her
money
to
buy
what
will
make
broth
for
it
helen
then
entered
the
room
made
her
inquiries
for
the
little
sufferer
and
putting
her
donation
into
sinful
betty
thomas
soapy
hand
returned
to
simpson
and
rosalind
who
remained
conversing
at
the
door
it
was
raining
hard
and
miss
mowbray
asked
simpson
if
she
should
take
her
home
that
is
an
offer
that
i
wo
refuse
miss
mowbray
though
i
am
within
and
you
are
without
the
pale
but
i
am
terribly
subject
to
catching
cold
and
i
do
assure
you
that
this
winter
weather
makes
a
serious
christian
duty
very
difficult
to
do
i
have
got
rid
of
seventy
tracts
since
first
of
december
you
sell
the
tracts
do
you
not
mrs
simpson
said
rosalind
yes
miss
torrington
i
sell
them
and
lend
them
and
now
and
then
give
them
when
i
think
it
is
a
great
object
to
have
them
seen
in
any
particular
house
have
you
collected
much
by
the
sale
not
a
very
large
sum
as
yet
miss
torrington
but
i
am
getting
on
in
many
different
ways
for
the
furtherance
of
heaven
work
perhaps
ladies
though
you
have
not
as
yet
put
your
own
hands
to
the
plough
that
shall
open
the
way
for
you
to
a
place
among
the
heavenly
host
you
may
like
to
see
my
account
i
should
like
it
very
much
simpson
said
rosalind
the
lady
then
drew
from
her
reticule
a
small
from
which
she
read
several
items
which
from
various
sources
contributed
as
she
said
to
fill
a
bag
for
the
work
to
be
expended
upon
the
saints
by
the
hands
of
their
pious
vicar
by
the
time
this
interesting
lecture
was
finished
the
carriage
had
reached
simpson
door
and
having
set
her
down
was
ordered
home
now
will
i
give
charles
a
to
the
exquisite
poetical
effusion
which
he
bestowed
on
me
some
time
since
said
rosalind
drawing
forth
pencil
and
paper
from
a
pocket
of
the
carriage
in
which
mowbray
was
accustomed
of
late
to
deposit
what
the
vicar
called
sacred
memoranda
by
which
were
signified
all
the
scraps
of
gossip
respecting
the
poor
people
among
whom
she
distributed
tracts
that
she
could
collect
for
his
private
ear
having
invoked
the
sisters
nine
for
the
space
of
five
minutes
she
read
aloud
the
result
to
helen
who
declared
herself
willing
to
give
testimony
if
called
upon
to
the
faithful
rendering
save
and
except
the
rhymes
of
the
financial
document
to
which
they
had
just
listened

each
serious

by
myself

and
more

thirteen

this
is
a
new
accomplishment
said
helen
laughing
and
i
declare
to
you
rosalind
i
think
it
very
unnecessary
roman
and
unkind
to
perform
any
more
works
of
supererogation
in
that
fascinating
style
upon
the
heart
of
poor
charles
i
am
afraid
he
has
had
more
than
is
good
for
him
already
i
do
not
think
the
beauty
of
my
verses
will
at
all
tend
to
injure
mowbray
peace
of
mind
replied
rosalind
rather
coldly
however
we
can
watch
their
effects
you
know
and
if
we
see
any
alarming
symptoms
coming
on
we
can
withdraw
them
just
before
they
reached
the
they
perceived
charles
on
foot
before
them
and
stopping
the
carriage
helen
made
him
get
in
just
to
tell
them
as
she
said
how
her
dear
godmother
was
what
kind
messages
she
had
sent
her
and
though
last
not
least
whether
any
tidings
had
been
heard
of
the
commission
charles
appeared
to
be
in
excellent
spirits
repeated
many
pleasant
observations
uttered
by
sir
gilbert
on
the
effervescent
nature
of
his
mother
malady
told
them
that
a
commission
in
the
horse
guards
was
declared
to
be
at
his
service
as
soon
as
the
money
for
it
was
forthcoming
for
which
if
needs
must
even
sir
gilbert
had
permitted
him
to
draw
on
corbold
and
finally
that
he
believed
they
had
all
alarmed
themselves
about
cartwright
and
his
pernicious
influences
in
a
very
wrong
and
unreasonable
manner
on
reaching
the
house
they
entered
the
library
which
was
the
usual
winter
but
it
was
quite
deserted
they
drew
round
the
fire
for
a
few
minutes
further
discussion
of
the
news
and
the
gossip
which
charles
had
brought
and
apropos
of
some
of
the
oakley
anecdotes
of
the
proceedings
at
wrexhill
helen
requested
rosalind
to
produce
her
version
of
simpson
deeds
of
grace
willingly
replied
miss
torrington
drawing
the
paper
from
her
pocket
you
dedicated
a
poem
to
me
mowbray
some
weeks
ago
and
i
now
beg
to
testify
my
gratitude
by
presenting
you
with
this
charles
took
the
paper
and
while
fixing
his
eyes
with
a
good
deal
of
meaning
upon
the
beautiful
giver
kissed
it
and
said
do
you
make
it
a
principle
miss
torrington
to
return
in
kind
every
offering
that
is
made
you
that
is
she
replied
colouring
and
turning
round
to
say
something
to
helen
but
she
was
gone
rosalind
said
charles
thrusting
her
paper
unread
into
his
bosom
this
commission
though
we
hail
it
as
good
fortune
will
yet
put
an
end
to
by
far
the
happiest
period
of
my
existence
unless
i
may
hope
rosalind
that
if
ever
the
time
should
come
and
i
now
think
it
will
come
when
i
may
again
consider
myself
as
the
heir
to
a
large
property
i
may
hope
that
you
will
some
day
suffer
me
to
lay
this
property
at
your
feet
never
lay
your
property
at
the
feet
of
any
one
mowbray
she
replied
carelessly
charles
coloured
and
looked
grievously
offended
you
teach
me
at
least
miss
torrington
to
beware
how
i
venture
again
to
hope
that
you
would
accept
any
thing
i
could
lay
at
yours
nay
do
not
say
so
mowbray
i
accept
daily
from
you
most
willingly
and
gratefully
unnumbered
testimonies
of
friendship
and
good
will
and
if
their
being
kindly
welcomed
will
ensure
their
continuance
you
will
not
let
them
cease
i
am
a
coxcomb
for
having
ever
hoped
for
more
said
charles
leaving
the
room
with
cheeks
painfully
glowing
and
a
heart
indignantly
throbbing
he
had
not
looked
for
this
repulse
and
his
disappointment
was
abundantly
painful
over
and
over
again
had
he
decided
while
holding
counsel
with
himself
on
the
subject
that
he
would
not
propose
to
rosalind
till
his
mother
had
made
him
independent
but
these
resolutions
were
the
result
rather
of
a
feeling
of
generosity
than
of
timidity
yet
charles
mowbray
was
no
coxcomb
miss
torrington
was
not
herself
aware
how
many
trifling
but
symptoms
of
partial
liking
she
had
betrayed
towards
him
during
the
last
few
weeks
and
as
it
never
entered
his
imagination
to
believe
that
she
could
doubt
the
reality
of
his
strong
attachment
he
attributed
the
repulse
he
had
received
as
well
as
all
the
encouragement
which
led
him
to
risk
it
as
the
result
of
the
most
cruel
and
coquetry
it
is
probable
that
he
left
rosalind
little
better
satisfied
with
herself
than
he
was
with
her
but
unfortunately
there
is
no
medium
by
which
thoughts
carefully
hid
in
one
bosom
can
be
made
to
pour
their
light
and
warmth
into
another
and
much
misery
was
in
this
instance
as
well
as
in
ten
thousand
others
endured
by
each
party
only
for
want
of
understanding
what
was
going
on
in
the
heart
of
the
other
mowbray
determined
not
to
waste
another
hour
in
uncertainty
as
to
the
manner
in
which
his
commission
was
to
be
paid
for
and
his
future
expenses
supplied
but
in
his
way
to
his
mother
he
delayed
long
enough
to
say
to
helen
i
have
proposed
and
been
most
scornfully
rejected
helen
how
could
we
either
of
us
ever
dream
that
miss
torrington
showed
any
more
favour
to
me
than
she
would
have
done
to
any
brother
of
yours
had
he
been
a
hunchbacked
idiot
without
waiting
to
receive
any
expression
either
of
surprise
or
sympathy
he
left
his
sister
with
the
same
hurried
abruptness
with
which
he
sought
her
and
hastened
on
to
find
his
mother
she
was
sitting
alone
with
a
bible
on
one
side
of
her
and
two
tracts
on
the
other
in
her
hand
was
a
little
note
such
as
she
now
very
constantly
received
at
least
once
a
day
even
though
the
writer
might
have
left
her
presence
in
health
and
perfect
contentment
one
short
hour
before
she
started
at
the
sudden
entrance
of
her
son
and
her
delicately
pale
face
became
as
red
as
a
milkmaid
as
she
hastily
placed
the
note
she
was
reading
between
the
leaves
of
her
book
but
charles
saw
it
not
every
pulse
within
him
was
beating
with
such
violence
that
it
required
all
the
power
left
him
to
speak
that
which
he
had
to
say
had
his
mother
been
weighing
out
a
poison
and
packets
before
her
labelled
for
himself
and
his
sisters
he
would
not
have
seen
it
mother
he
said
i
have
received
notice
that
the
commission
in
the
horse
guards
which
my
father
applied
for
some
time
before
he
died
is
now
ready
for
me
will
you
have
the
kindness
to
furnish
me
with
the
means
of
paying
for
it
and
will
you
also
inform
me
on
what
sum
i
may
reckon
for
my
yearly
expenses
i
mean
to
join
immediately
mowbray
little
agitation
had
entirely
subsided
and
she
answered
with
much
solemnity
you
come
to
me
charles
in
a
very
abrupt
manner
and
apparently
in
a
very
thoughtless
frame
of
mind
to
speak
on
subjects
which
to
my
humble
capacity
seem
fraught
with
consequences
most
awfully
the
horse
guards
oh
charles
is
it
possible
you
can
have
lived
for
many
weeks
in
such
a
regenerated
family
as
mine
and
yet
turn
your
thoughts
towards
a
life
so
profane
as
that
of
an
officer
in
the
horse
guards
let
my
life
pass
where
it
may
mother
i
trust
it
will
not
be
a
profane
one
i
should
ill
repay
my
father
teaching
if
it
were
this
is
the
profession
which
he
chose
for
me
it
is
the
one
to
which
i
have
always
directed
my
hopes
and
it
is
that
which
i
decidedly
prefer
i
trust
therefore
that
you
will
not
object
to
my
following
the
course
which
my
most
excellent
father
pointed
out
to
me
i
shall
object
to
it
sir
and
pray
understand
at
once
that
i
will
never
suffer
the
intemperate
pleadings
of
a
young
man
to
overpower
the
voice
of
conscience
in
my
heart
poor
mowbray
felt
inclined
to
exclaim
when
sorrows
come
they
come
not
single
spies
but
in
battalions
for
a
moment
he
remained
perfectly
silent
and
then
said
this
is
very
terrible
news
for
me
mother
you
shall
hear
i
trust
no
intemperate
pleadings
but
i
hope
you
will
let
me
reason
with
you
on
the
subject
surely
you
will
not
blame
me
for
wishing
in
this
and
in
all
things
to
adhere
as
closely
as
may
be
to
my
dear
father
wishes
if
your
poor
father
charles
groped
through
life
surrounded
on
all
sides
with
outer
darkness
is
that
any
reason
that
i
should
suffer
the
son
he
left
under
my
care
and
control
to
do
so
likewise
when
he
left
the
whole
of
my
property
at
my
whole
and
sole
disposal
it
was
plain
that
he
felt
there
was
more
hope
of
wisdom
abiding
in
me
than
in
you
it
is
herein
and
herein
only
that
i
must
labour
to
do
according
to
his
wishes
and
his
will
and
endeavour
so
to
act
that
all
may
see
his
confidence
in
me
was
not
misplaced
for
heaven
sake
mother
think
well
before
you
determine
upon
disappointing
all
my
hopes
in
this
most
cruel
manner
and
believe
me
that
no
between
you
and
me
except
perhaps
the
mischievous
fanatic
who
has
lately
chosen
to
meddle
so
impertinently
in
our
affairs
but
will
feel
and
say
that
i
have
been
ill
treated
had
mowbray
not
been
stung
and
irritated
as
he
was
before
this
conversation
it
is
probable
he
would
not
have
remonstrated
thus
warmly
with
a
mother
whom
he
had
ever
been
accustomed
to
treat
with
the
most
tender
observance
and
respect
she
looked
at
him
with
equal
anger
and
astonishment
and
remained
for
some
time
without
speaking
a
word
or
withdrawing
her
eyes
from
his
face
if
her
son
felt
inclined
to
quote
shakspeare
at
the
beginning
of
the
conversation
she
might
have
done
so
at
the
end
of
it
for
all
she
wished
to
say
was
comprised
in
these
words
nay
then
i
send
those
to
you
that
can
speak
she
did
not
however
express
herself
exactly
thus
but
ended
her
long
examination
of
his
flushed
and
agitated
countenance
by
pronouncing
almost
in
a
whisper
this
is
very
terrible
but
i
thank
heaven
i
am
not
left
quite
alone
in
the
world
having
thus
spoken
she
rose
and
retired
to
her
leaving
her
very
unhappy
son
in
possession
of
her
morning
parlour
and
of
more
bitter
thoughts
than
had
ever
before
been
his
portion
having
continued
for
some
moments
exactly
in
the
position
in
which
she
left
him
he
at
length
started
up
and
endeavouring
to
rouse
himself
from
the
heavy
trance
that
seemed
to
have
fallen
on
him
he
hastened
to
find
helen
it
is
all
over
with
me
helen
said
he
you
know
what
i
met
with
in
the
library
and
now
my
mother
protests
against
my
accepting
my
commission
because
she
says
that
officers
lead
profane
lives
what
is
to
become
of
me
helen
have
patience
dearest
charles
all
this
can
not
last
it
can
not
be
supposed
that
we
can
submit
ourselves
to
the
will
of
cartwright
and
depend
upon
it
that
it
is
he
who
has
dictated
this
refusal
do
not
look
so
very
miserable
my
dear
brother
i
think
you
would
do
very
wisely
if
you
returned
to
oakley
to
dinner
for
many
reasons
bless
you
love
for
the
suggestion
it
will
indeed
be
a
relief
to
me
i
know
not
at
this
moment
which
i
most
desire
to
avoid
my
mother
or
miss
torrington
have
you
seen
her
rosalind
i
mean
no
charles
not
since
you
parted
from
her
i
heard
her
enter
her
room
and
lock
the
door
the
answer
you
have
received
from
her
surprises
me
more
and
vexes
me
more
than
even
my
mother
bless
you
helen
you
are
a
true
sister
and
a
true
friend
i
will
go
to
sir
gilbert
but
it
rains
hard
i
wish
i
had
the
cab
or
my
own
dear
mare
to
ride
but
that
a
minor
trouble
it
irks
me
though
for
it
comes
from
the
same
quarter
it
does
indeed
and
it
irks
me
too
believe
me
but
patience
charles
courage
and
patience
will
do
much
will
it
give
me
the
heart
of
the
woman
i
love
helen
or
rather
will
it
give
her
a
heart
it
is
that
which
galls
me
i
have
been
deceived
trifled
with
and
have
loved
with
my
whole
heart
and
soul
a
most
heartless
coquette
that
you
have
not
charles
replied
helen
warmly
that
you
have
not
i
too
have
mistaken
rosalind
feelings
towards
you
perhaps
she
has
mistaken
them
herself
but
she
is
not
heartless
and
above
all
there
is
no
seeming
about
her
how
i
love
you
for
contradicting
me
helen
and
for
that
bright
flush
that
so
eloquently
expresses
anger
and
indignation
at
my
injustice
but
if
she
be
not
a
coquette
then
must
i
be
a
most
consummate
puppy
for
as
i
live
helen
i
thought
she
loved
me
i
can
not
understand
it
but
i
know
that
rosalind
torrington
is
generous
and
sincere
and
whatever
it
is
which
has
led
us
to
misunderstand
her
either
now
or
heretofore
it
can
not
be
coquetry
or
of
any
kind
well
be
it
so
i
would
rather
the
fault
were
mine
than
hers
but
i
will
not
see
her
again
if
i
can
help
it
so
helen
my
lady
must
excuse
my
toilet
i
can
not
dress
and
then
walk
through
oakley
lane
chapter
xiv
the
entry
it
was
very
nearly
midnight
when
mowbray
returned
from
his
visit
to
sir
gilbert
harrington
to
his
great
surprise
he
found
helen
waiting
for
him
even
in
the
hall
for
the
moment
she
heard
the
she
ran
out
to
meet
him
why
are
you
up
so
late
helen
he
exclaimed
and
for
heaven
sake
tell
me
what
makes
you
look
so
where
is
rosalind
she
is
in
bed
she
has
been
in
tears
all
day
i
made
her
go
to
bed
but
oh
charles
my
mother
she
has
left
the
house
gracious
heaven
what
do
you
mean
did
she
leave
the
house
in
anger
did
she
ask
for
me
no
charles
nor
for
me
either
and
where
on
earth
is
she
gone
no
one
in
the
house
has
the
remotest
idea
it
is
impossible
even
to
guess
but
she
has
taken
fanny
and
curtis
with
her
when
did
she
set
out
while
rosalind
and
i
were
eating
our
miserable
melancholy
dinner
cartwright
i
find
called
after
you
went
and
was
shown
as
usual
to
her
but
he
did
not
stay
thomas
says
above
half
an
hour
for
he
both
let
him
in
and
out
soon
after
he
went
away
fanny
was
sent
for
and
she
and
curtis
remained
with
her
till
a
few
minutes
before
curtis
then
went
into
the
kitchen
it
seems
and
ordered
a
tray
to
be
taken
for
my
mother
and
fanny
into
the
and
the
only
message
sent
to
rosalind
and
me
was
that
mamma
was
not
well
and
begged
not
to
be
disturbed
curtis
must
have
seen
the
coachman
and
settled
every
thing
with
him
very
secretly
for
not
one
of
the
servants
except
the
new
knew
that
the
carriage
was
ordered
how
are
we
to
interpret
this
helen
such
a
night
too
as
dark
as
pitch
had
i
not
known
the
way
blindfold
i
should
never
have
got
home
i
left
sir
gilbert
in
a
rage
because
i
would
not
sleep
there
but
my
heart
was
heavy
i
felt
restless
and
anxious
at
the
idea
of
remaining
from
you
during
the
night
i
think
it
was
a
presentiment
of
this
dreadful
oh
what
a
day
has
this
been
to
me
so
gay
so
happy
in
the
morning
so
supremely
wretched
before
night
i
can
remember
nothing
that
i
said
which
could
possibly
have
driven
her
to
leave
her
home
what
can
it
mean
helen
alas
charles
i
have
no
power
to
answer
you
if
asking
questions
could
avail
might
i
not
ask
what
i
have
done
and
yet
at
the
moment
of
her
leaving
home
for
the
night
she
sent
me
word
that
i
was
to
disturb
the
roads
too
are
so
bad
had
she
lamps
helen
oh
yes
some
of
the
maids
while
shutting
up
the
rooms
upstairs
saw
the
lights
moving
very
rapidly
towards
the
lodges
it
is
an
inexplicable
and
very
painful
mystery
but
go
to
bed
my
dearest
helen
you
look
most
wretchedly
ill
and
miserable
ill
no
i
am
not
ill
charles
but
miserable
yes
more
miserable
than
i
have
ever
felt
since
my
poor
father
death
was
first
made
known
to
me
the
following
morning
brought
no
relief
to
the
anxiety
which
this
strange
absence
occasioned
rosalind
joined
the
brother
and
sister
at
breakfast
and
her
jaded
looks
more
than
confirmed
helen
report
of
the
preceding
night
charles
however
hardly
saw
her
sufficiently
to
know
how
she
looked
for
he
carefully
avoided
her
eyes
but
if
the
gentlest
and
most
soothing
tone
of
voice
and
the
expression
of
her
almost
tender
sympathy
in
the
uneasiness
he
was
enduring
could
have
consoled
the
young
man
for
all
he
had
suffered
and
was
suffering
he
would
have
been
consoled
the
day
passed
heavily
but
helen
looked
so
very
ill
and
so
very
unhappy
that
charles
could
not
bear
to
leave
her
and
though
a
mutual
feeling
of
embarrassment
between
himself
and
rosalind
made
his
remaining
with
them
a
very
doubtful
advantage
he
never
quitted
them
but
it
was
quite
in
vain
that
he
attempted
to
renew
the
occupations
which
had
made
the
last
six
weeks
pass
so
delightfully
he
began
to
read
but
helen
stopped
him
before
the
end
of
the
page
by
saying
i
can
not
think
what
is
the
reason
of
it
charles
but
i
can
not
comprehend
a
single
syllable
of
what
you
are
reading
rosalind
blushing
to
the
ears
and
actually
trembling
from
head
to
foot
invited
him
to
play
at
chess
with
her
without
replying
a
word
he
brought
the
table
and
set
up
the
men
before
her
but
the
result
of
the
game
was
that
charles
gave
rosalind
checkmate
and
it
was
helen
only
who
discovered
it
at
an
early
hour
they
separated
for
the
night
for
the
idea
of
waiting
for
mowbray
seemed
equally
painful
to
them
all
and
the
sun
rose
upon
them
only
to
bring
a
repetition
of
the
sad
and
restless
hours
of
the
day
that
was
past
truly
might
they
have
said
they
were
weary
of
conjecture
for
so
completely
had
they
exhausted
every
supposition
to
which
the
imagination
of
either
of
the
party
could
reach
without
finding
one
on
which
common
sense
would
permit
them
to
repose
that
by
what
seemed
common
consent
they
ceased
to
hazard
a
single
may
be
more
they
were
sitting
with
their
before
them
and
rosalind
was
once
more
trying
to
fix
the
attention
of
charles
as
well
as
her
own
to
the
when
a
lusty
pull
at
the
produced
an
alarm
which
caused
all
the
servants
in
the
house
to
jump
from
their
seats
and
one
half
of
the
chessmen
to
be
overturned
by
the
violent
start
of
rosalind
a
few
moments
of
breathless
expectation
followed
the
house
door
was
opened
and
the
steps
of
several
persons
were
heard
in
the
hall
but
no
voice
accompanied
them
helen
rose
but
trembled
so
violently
that
her
brother
threw
his
arms
round
her
and
almost
carried
her
to
a
sofa
rosalind
stood
beside
her
looking
very
nearly
as
pale
as
herself
while
charles
made
three
steps
forward
and
one
back
again
and
then
stood
with
his
hands
clasped
and
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
door
in
a
manner
which
showed
that
in
spite
of
his
manhood
he
was
very
nearly
as
much
agitated
as
his
companions
the
next
sound
they
heard
was
the
voice
of
the
lady
of
the
mansion
and
she
spoke
loud
and
clear
as
she
laid
her
hand
on
the
lock
and
partly
opening
the
door
said
addressing
the
butler
who
with
half
a
dozen
other
servingmen
had
hurried
to
answer
the
bell
chivers
order
all
the
servants
to
meet
me
in
this
room
immediately
and
fail
not
to
come
yourself
mowbray
had
again
stepped
forward
upon
hearing
his
mother
voice
but
stopped
short
to
listen
to
her
words
and
having
heard
them
he
turned
back
again
and
placing
himself
behind
the
sofa
on
which
helen
sat
leaned
over
it
to
whisper
in
her
ear
let
me
not
see
you
overcome
helen
and
then
i
shall
be
able
to
bear
any
thing
as
he
spoke
the
door
was
thrown
widely
open
and
a
lady
entered
dressed
entirely
in
white
and
very
deeply
veiled
followed
by
fanny
mowbray
and
cartwright
a
heavy
sense
of
faintness
seized
on
the
heart
of
helen
but
she
stood
up
and
endeavoured
to
advance
rosalind
on
the
contrary
stepped
back
and
seated
herself
in
the
darkest
corner
of
the
room
while
charles
hastily
walked
towards
the
veiled
lady
and
in
a
voice
thick
from
emotion
exclaimed
my
mother
yes
charles
she
replied
your
mother
but
no
longer
a
widowed
desolate
mother
shrinking
before
the
unnatural
rebuke
of
her
son
i
would
willingly
have
acted
with
greater
appearance
of
deliberation
but
your
conduct
rendered
this
impossible
cartwright
permit
me
to
present
you
to
this
young
man
and
his
sister
as
my
husband
and
their
father
this
terrible
but
expected
annunciation
was
received
in
total
silence
mowbray
seemed
to
think
only
of
his
sister
for
without
looking
towards
the
person
thus
solemnly
presented
to
him
he
turned
to
her
and
taking
her
by
the
arm
said
helen
you
had
better
sit
down
fanny
who
had
entered
the
room
immediately
after
her
mother
looked
pale
and
frightened
but
though
she
fixed
a
tearful
eye
on
helen
she
attempted
not
to
approach
her
cartwright
himself
stood
beside
his
bride
or
rather
a
little
in
advance
of
her
his
tall
person
drawn
up
to
its
greatest
height
meekness
gentleness
and
humility
appeared
to
have
his
lips
in
their
keeping
but
unquenchable
triumph
was
running
riot
in
his
eyes
and
flashed
upon
every
individual
before
him
with
a
very
unequivocal
and
somewhat
scornful
air
of
authority
this
tableau
endured
till
the
door
was
again
thrown
open
and
one
by
one
the
servants
entered
forming
at
last
a
long
line
completely
across
the
room
when
all
were
in
their
marshalled
places
which
here
as
elsewhere
were
in
as
exact
conformity
to
the
received
order
of
precedence
as
if
they
had
been
nobles
at
a
coronation
the
lady
bride
again
lifted
her
voice
and
addressed
them
thus
i
have
called
you
all
together
on
the
present
occasion
in
order
to
inform
you
that
cartwright
is
my
husband
and
your
master
i
hope
it
is
unnecessary
for
me
to
say
that
every
thing
in
the
family
must
henceforward
be
submitted
solely
to
his
pleasure
and
that
his
commands
must
on
all
occasions
supersede
those
of
every
other
person
i
trust
you
will
all
show
yourselves
sensible
of
the
inestimable
blessing
i
have
bestowed
upon
you
in
thus
giving
you
a
master
who
can
lead
you
unto
everlasting
life
and
as
i
have
married
for
the
glory
of
heaven
so
i
trust
to
receive
its
blessing
upon
the
same
and
to
see
every
member
of
my
family
advancing
daily
under
the
guidance
of
their
earthly
master
hand
to
that
state
which
shall
ensure
them
favour
from
their
heavenly
one
in
the
life
to
come
amen
repeat
i
beg
you
all
of
you
repeat
with
me
amen
though
there
were
some
throats
there
in
which
amen
would
have
stuck
there
were
enough
present
besides
these
to
get
up
a
tolerably
articulate
amen
cartwright
then
stepped
forward
and
laying
his
hat
and
gloves
on
the
table
said
aloud
let
us
pray
the
obedient
menials
knelt
before
him
all
save
one
this
bold
exception
was
the
housekeeper
a
staid
and
sober
person
of
fifty
years
of
age
who
during
the
dozen
years
she
had
presided
over
the
household
had
constantly
evinced
a
strict
and
conscientious
adherence
to
her
religious
duties
and
was
moreover
distinguished
for
her
uniformly
respectful
quiet
and
unobtrusive
demeanour
but
she
now
stepped
forward
from
her
place
at
the
head
of
the
line
and
said
in
a
low
voice
but
very
slowly
and
distinctly
i
can
not
sir
on
this
occasion
kneel
down
to
pray
at
your
bidding
this
is
not
a
holy
business
at
all
cartwright
and
if
you
were
to
give
me
for
salary
the
half
of
what
you
are
about
to
wring
from
the
orphan
children
of
my
late
master
deceased
just
eight
calendar
months
ago
i
would
not
take
it
sir
to
live
here
and
witness
what
i
can
not
but
look
upon
as
great
sin
the
good
woman
then
gave
a
sad
look
at
helen
and
her
brother
who
were
standing
together
dropped
a
respectful
curtesy
as
her
eyes
rested
on
them
and
then
left
the
room
her
sin
be
on
her
own
head
said
cartwright
as
he
himself
kneeled
down
upon
a
footstool
which
stood
near
the
table
he
drew
a
cambric
handkerchief
from
his
pocket
gave
a
preparatory
hem
and
apparently
unconscious
that
miss
torrington
had
darted
from
the
remote
corner
in
which
she
had
been
ensconced
and
followed
the
housekeeper
out
of
the
room
remained
for
a
moment
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
mowbray
and
helen
who
remained
standing
it
would
be
a
frightful
mockery
for
us
to
kneel
said
charles
drawing
his
sister
back
to
the
sofa
she
had
quitted
sit
down
with
me
helen
and
when
we
are
alone
we
will
pray
for
strength
to
endure
as
we
ought
to
do
whatever
calamity
it
is
heaven
will
to
try
us
with
the
bride
was
kneeling
beside
her
husband
but
she
rose
up
and
said
you
are
of
age
charles
mowbray
and
too
and
wilful
to
obey
your
mother
but
you
helen
i
command
to
kneel
she
then
replaced
herself
with
much
solemnity
and
helen
knelt
too
while
breathing
a
silent
prayer
to
be
forgiven
for
what
she
felt
to
be
profanation
charles
stood
for
a
moment
irresolute
and
then
said
dropping
on
his
knees
beside
her
heaven
will
pardon
me
for
your
sake
dear
helen
even
for
kneeling
at
a
service
that
my
heart
disclaims
cartwright
hemmed
again
and
began
i
thank
thee
that
by
thy
especial
calling
and
election
i
am
placed
where
so
many
sinful
souls
are
found
who
through
and
by
me
may
be
shown
the
path
by
which
to
escape
the
eternal
pains
of
hell
but
let
thy
flames
blaze
and
burn
o
lord
for
those
who
neglect
so
great
salvation
pour
down
upon
them
visibly
thy
avenging
judgments
and
let
the
earth
see
it
and
be
afraid
to
me
o
lord
grant
power
strength
and
courage
to
do
the
work
that
is
set
before
me
let
me
be
a
rod
and
a
scourge
to
the
ungodly
and
let
no
sinful
weakness
on
the
part
of
the
wife
whom
thou
hast
given
me
come
across
or
overshadow
the
light
received
from
thee
for
the
leading
of
the
rebellious
back
unto
thy
paths
bless
my
virtuous
wife
teach
her
to
be
meekly
obedient
to
my
word
and
to
thine
through
me
and
make
her
so
to
value
the
inestimable
mercy
of
being
placed
in
the
guiding
hands
of
thy
elected
servant
that
the
miserable
earthly
dross
which
she
maketh
over
to
me
in
exchange
for
the
same
may
seem
but
as
dirt
and
filthiness
in
her
sight
may
such
children
as
are
already
born
unto
her
be
brought
to
a
due
sense
of
thy
exceeding
mercy
in
thus
putting
it
into
their
mother
heart
to
choose
thine
elected
servant
to
lead
them
through
the
dangerous
paths
of
youth
make
them
rejoice
and
be
exceeding
glad
for
the
same
for
so
shall
it
be
good
in
thy
sight
this
terrible
thanksgiving
with
all
its
minute
rehearsing
of
people
and
of
things
went
on
for
a
considerable
time
longer
but
enough
has
been
given
to
show
the
spirit
of
it
as
soon
as
it
was
ended
the
new
master
of
the
mansion
rose
from
his
knees
and
waiting
with
an
appearance
of
some
little
impatience
till
his
audience
had
all
recovered
their
feet
he
turned
to
his
bride
with
a
smile
of
much
complacency
and
said
cartwright
my
love
where
shall
i
order
chivers
to
bring
us
some
refreshments
probably
the
fire
is
out
shall
we
sup
here
wherever
you
please
answered
the
lady
meekly
and
blushing
a
little
at
the
sound
of
her
new
name
pronounced
for
the
first
time
before
her
children
this
address
and
the
answer
to
it
were
too
much
for
helen
to
endure
with
any
appearance
of
composure
she
hid
her
face
in
her
handkerchief
as
she
passed
her
mother
and
giving
fanny
who
was
seated
near
the
door
a
hasty
kiss
left
the
room
followed
by
her
brother
helen
ran
to
the
apartment
of
rosalind
and
mowbray
ran
with
her
forgetful
as
it
seemed
of
the
indecorum
of
such
an
unauthorized
intrusion
at
any
time
and
more
forgetful
still
of
the
icy
barrier
which
had
seemed
to
exist
between
him
and
its
fair
inhabitant
since
the
first
expression
of
his
love
and
of
his
hope
had
been
so
cruelly
chilled
by
her
light
answer
to
it
but
in
this
moment
of
new
misery
every
thing
was
forgotten
but
the
common
sorrow
they
found
rosalind
passionately
sobbing
and
williams
the
housekeeper
weeping
very
heartily
beside
her
oh
my
helen
exclaimed
the
young
heiress
springing
forward
to
meet
her
williams
says
they
can
not
take
my
money
from
me
will
you
let
us
divide
my
fortune
and
live
together
williams
forgets
your
age
rosalind
replied
helen
but
though
there
was
pain
in
recalling
this
disqualifying
truth
there
was
a
glance
of
pleasure
too
in
the
look
with
which
helen
thanked
her
and
charles
as
he
gazed
on
her
swollen
eyes
and
working
features
felt
that
cruel
as
she
had
been
to
him
she
must
ever
be
the
dearest
as
she
was
the
best
and
the
loveliest
being
in
the
world
and
there
was
assuredly
comfort
even
at
such
a
moment
in
the
devoted
friendship
of
rosalind
and
in
the
respectful
but
earnest
expressions
of
affection
from
the
good
housekeeper
but
the
future
prospects
of
charles
and
his
sisters
was
one
upon
which
it
was
impossible
to
look
without
dismay
what
ought
we
to
do
said
helen
appealing
as
much
to
her
old
servant
as
her
young
friend
can
it
be
our
duty
to
live
with
this
hypocritical
and
designing
wretch
and
call
him
no
replied
rosalind
vehemently
to
do
so
would
be
shame
and
sin
but
where
can
the
poor
girls
take
refuge
you
forget
miss
torrington
that
they
are
penniless
said
charles
but
i
am
not
penniless
sir
replied
rosalind
looking
at
him
with
an
expression
of
anger
that
proceeded
wholly
from
his
formal
mode
of
address
but
which
he
interpreted
as
the
result
of
a
manner
assumed
to
keep
him
at
a
distance
may
i
venture
to
say
one
word
my
dear
children
before
i
take
my
leave
of
you
said
williams
oh
yes
said
helen
taking
her
by
the
hand
i
wish
you
would
give
us
your
advice
williams
we
are
too
young
to
decide
for
ourselves
at
such
a
dreadful
moment
as
this
and
for
that
very
reason
my
dear
miss
helen
i
would
have
you
wait
a
little
before
you
decide
at
all
master
charles
i
beg
his
pardon
mowbray
is
altogether
a
different
consideration
and
if
so
be
it
is
any
way
possible
for
him
i
think
he
should
leave
and
wait
for
the
end
elsewhere
but
for
you
and
poor
miss
fanny
my
dear
young
lady
i
do
think
you
must
learn
to
bear
and
forbear
till
such
time
as
you
may
leave
your
misguided
mamma
and
perhaps
accept
this
noble
young
lady
offer
and
share
her
great
fortune
with
her
for
a
time
i
mean
miss
helen
for
it
ca
be
but
my
mistress
will
come
to
her
senses
sooner
or
later
and
then
she
will
remember
she
is
a
mother
and
she
will
remember
too
take
my
word
for
it
the
but
too
confiding
gentleman
who
was
your
father
tears
flowed
from
every
eye
for
poor
mowbray
was
no
exception
at
this
allusion
to
the
beloved
father
the
gentle
master
and
the
friendly
guardian
but
this
did
not
prevent
the
good
woman
words
from
having
their
full
weight
it
rather
added
to
it
for
it
brought
back
the
vivid
remembrance
of
one
in
whose
temper
there
was
no
gall
it
will
be
hard
to
bear
williams
replied
helen
but
i
do
indeed
believe
that
you
are
right
and
that
for
a
time
at
least
this
cruelly
changed
house
must
be
our
home
but
do
you
know
that
in
the
midst
of
all
our
misery
i
have
one
comfort
i
think
poor
fanny
will
be
restored
to
us
did
you
see
the
expression
of
her
lovely
face
as
she
looked
at
us
charles
even
you
did
not
look
more
miserable
and
if
that
be
so
miss
helen
it
may
atone
for
much
for
it
was
a
grievous
sight
to
see
the
poor
innocent
child
taking
all
cartwright
brass
for
gold
if
she
has
got
a
peep
at
his
cloven
foot
i
shall
leave
you
almost
with
a
light
heart
for
i
have
grieved
over
her
i
will
take
all
the
comfort
i
can
williams
from
your
words
and
will
follow
your
counsel
too
upon
one
condition
and
that
is
nobody
must
prevent
my
setting
off
betimes
morning
as
you
and
i
did
rosalind
once
before
for
oakley
if
my
dear
godmother
advises
me
as
you
do
williams
i
will
return
and
quietly
put
my
neck
into
this
hateful
yoke
and
so
remain
till
heaven
shall
see
fit
to
release
me
heaven
knows
i
shall
not
oppose
that
plan
said
rosalind
eagerly
for
to
my
judgment
it
is
the
very
best
you
can
pursue
indeed
i
think
so
added
charles
and
dark
and
dismal
as
the
mornings
are
i
would
advise
you
helen
to
set
out
before
the
time
arrives
for
either
accepting
or
refusing
the
general
summons
to
join
the
family
and
may
i
go
too
said
rosalind
with
a
glance
half
reproachful
at
charles
for
the
manner
in
which
he
seemed
to
avoid
speaking
to
her
may
you
rosalind
cried
helen
for
pity
sake
do
not
fancy
it
possible
that
i
can
do
anything
without
you
now
i
should
feel
that
you
were
forsaking
me
i
never
forsake
any
one
that
i
have
ever
loved
said
rosalind
with
emotion
whatever
you
or
any
one
else
may
think
to
the
contrary
well
then
we
will
all
three
go
together
but
you
little
thought
rosalind
when
you
first
came
here
that
you
would
have
to
trudge
through
muddy
lanes
and
under
wintry
skies
for
want
of
a
carriage
but
on
this
occasion
at
least
we
will
not
ask
cartwright
to
permit
us
the
use
of
one
of
his
then
go
to
bed
my
dear
young
ladies
said
williams
that
you
may
be
early
up
and
let
me
hear
from
you
miss
helen
i
shall
not
go
from
wrexhill
at
least
not
till
i
know
a
little
how
you
will
settle
every
thing
i
will
take
freeman
pretty
little
rooms
that
you
always
admire
so
much
master
charles
and
there
i
will
stay
for
the
present
oh
that
beautiful
little
cottage
that
they
call
the
mowbray
arms
said
rosalind
how
we
shall
envy
her
helen
the
party
then
separated
for
the
good
housekeeper
most
strenuously
opposed
rosalind
proposition
of
passing
the
night
with
her
friend
you
would
neither
of
you
sleep
a
wink
ladies
if
you
bide
together
and
now
though
there
is
more
sorrow
with
you
than
such
young
hearts
ought
to
have
yet
you
will
sleep
when
you
have
nobody
to
talk
to
about
it
for
what
makes
old
folks
wake
and
watch
will
often
made
young
folks
sleep
and
the
good
woman
prediction
proved
true
though
the
sleep
that
followed
the
tremendous
blow
they
had
received
was
too
feverish
and
full
of
dreams
to
make
the
waking
feel
like
that
delightful
return
to
new
life
and
new
joy
which
the
waking
of
the
young
should
ever
be
chapter
xv
walk
to
oakley
domestic
arrangements
the
village
inn
fortunately
for
their
proposed
expedition
the
morning
broke
more
brightly
than
a
december
morning
could
reasonably
be
expected
to
do
and
the
trio
set
off
on
their
walk
to
oakley
almost
as
soon
as
it
was
light
the
expedition
notwithstanding
the
unhappy
cause
of
it
would
have
been
less
silent
and
less
sad
had
not
charles
thought
rosalind
capricious
and
cruel
and
had
not
rosalind
thought
charles
unkind
and
cold
nothing
could
appear
more
likely
to
perpetuate
the
unfortunate
misunderstanding
between
them
than
the
heavy
misfortune
that
had
fallen
upon
mowbray
his
total
dependence
contrasted
with
miss
wealth
was
perpetually
recurring
to
him
producing
a
degree
of
restraint
in
his
manner
that
cut
rosalind
to
the
heart
and
roused
all
her
womanly
pride
to
prevent
the
feeling
of
attachment
to
which
his
present
sorrows
gave
tenfold
strength
from
betraying
itself
the
tripping
lightly
through
summer
paths
and
the
picking
one
way
through
wintry
lanes
are
two
very
different
operations
and
notwithstanding
their
early
rising
they
found
the
baronet
and
his
lady
already
at
the
the
astonishment
occasioned
by
their
appearance
was
great
but
yet
it
was
a
joyous
astonishment
and
it
was
some
time
before
sir
noisy
welcome
subsided
sufficiently
for
her
ladyship
more
quiet
and
more
anxious
inquiries
could
be
either
answered
or
heard
at
length
there
was
something
in
the
tone
of
helen
voice
the
glance
of
rosalind
eye
and
the
silent
pressure
of
mowbray
hand
which
awakened
his
attention
why
you
have
walked
over
to
see
us
my
dear
girls
and
it
was
behaving
like
a
pair
of
little
angels
to
do
so
but
you
not
one
half
as
well
pleased
to
see
me
as
i
am
to
see
you
come
here
helen
sit
down
in
my
own
chair
here
and
get
warm
and
then
the
words
will
thaw
and
come
forth
like
the
notes
from
the
horn
of
munchausen
postboy
and
your
black
eyes
miss
rose
do
look
half
as
saucy
as
they
used
do
and
as
for
charles
what
on
earth
is
the
matter
with
ye
all
helen
burst
into
tears
and
buried
her
face
in
lady
harrington
bosom
sir
gilbert
said
mowbray
colouring
to
the
temples
my
mother
is
married
the
devil
she
is
thundered
the
old
man
clenching
his
fists
married
is
she
jezebel
may
your
poor
father
ghost
haunt
her
to
her
dying
hour
married
to
that
canting
cur
the
vicar
of
wrexhill
is
it
not
so
even
so
sir
gilbert
heaven
help
you
my
poor
children
said
lady
harrington
in
accents
of
the
deepest
sorrow
this
is
a
grief
that
it
will
indeed
be
hard
to
bear
and
we
come
to
you
for
counsel
how
to
bear
it
my
dear
lady
said
mowbray
though
little
choice
is
left
us
yet
helen
says
if
you
tell
her
that
she
must
submit
to
call
this
man
her
father
it
will
be
easier
for
her
to
do
it
bless
her
darling
child
said
the
old
lady
fondly
caressing
her
how
shall
i
ever
find
the
heart
to
bid
her
do
what
it
must
break
her
heart
to
think
of
bid
her
call
that
rascal
father
cried
sir
gilbert
my
lady
harrington
must
be
strangely
altered
mowbray
before
she
will
do
that
she
is
a
very
rebellious
old
lady
and
a
most
prodigious
shrew
but
you
do
her
no
justice
charles
in
believing
she
would
utter
such
atrocious
words
but
what
is
to
become
of
helen
my
dear
sir
gilbert
if
she
quarrel
with
this
man
come
to
us
to
be
sure
what
the
man
to
her
has
your
precious
mother
made
any
settlement
upon
you
all
i
imagine
not
indeed
i
may
say
that
i
am
sure
she
has
not
am
i
a
prophet
my
lady
how
did
i
tell
you
mowbray
sentimental
will
would
answer
and
has
this
meek
and
gentle
lady
proved
herself
deserving
of
all
the
pretty
things
i
said
of
her
there
is
but
small
comfort
in
remembering
how
truly
how
very
truly
your
predictions
foretold
what
has
happened
sir
gilbert
and
he
has
predicted
that
you
must
come
here
my
sweet
helen
let
this
come
true
likewise
i
can
not
leave
poor
fanny
lady
harrington
replied
helen
i
can
not
leave
my
dear
and
generous
friend
rosalind
and
yet
your
offered
kindness
cheers
my
heart
and
i
shall
think
of
it
with
pleasure
and
gratitude
as
long
as
i
live
but
i
thought
fanny
was
a
disciple
of
this
calvinistic
gentleman
if
so
it
were
better
she
remained
with
him
till
she
has
learned
to
distinguish
hypocrisy
from
virtue
and
cant
from
true
religion
and
for
miss
torrington
i
shall
rejoice
to
have
her
for
my
guest
for
as
long
a
time
as
she
can
find
our
mansion
agreeable
to
her
you
are
very
very
kind
replied
the
two
friends
in
the
same
breath
then
so
let
it
be
charles
these
good
girls
will
stay
here
for
the
present
so
let
us
eat
our
breakfast
let
me
save
them
from
the
odious
spectacle
of
the
vicar
of
wrexhill
establishing
himself
at
mowbray
park
and
the
future
must
take
care
of
itself
but
fanny
said
helen
doubtingly
she
looked
so
unhappy
as
she
followed
my
mother
in
last
night
that
i
feel
almost
certain
her
fit
of
enthusiasm
is
already
over
so
much
the
better
my
dear
said
sir
gilbert
but
it
will
do
her
a
vast
deal
of
good
to
watch
the
reverend
gentleman
proceedings
in
his
new
character
that
scratch
upon
her
intellect
must
be
cauterized
before
i
shall
believe
it
cured
and
when
the
operation
is
complete
she
may
join
the
party
here
as
for
you
my
dear
boy
when
your
breakfast
is
finished
i
have
something
for
your
ear
in
private
this
was
the
proposal
of
a
loan
sufficient
for
the
purchase
of
the
commission
and
for
the
supply
of
the
expenses
consequent
upon
joining
his
corps
but
this
mowbray
could
not
be
prevailed
upon
to
accept
and
his
reasons
for
refusing
it
were
such
that
when
he
could
prevail
on
the
friendly
old
gentleman
to
listen
to
him
he
could
not
deny
that
there
was
much
weight
in
them
if
i
withdraw
myself
altogether
from
my
mother
at
this
moment
said
charles
i
shall
give
her
husband
an
excellent
and
very
plausible
excuse
for
persuading
her
to
banish
me
from
her
house
and
her
heart
for
ever
whereas
if
i
remain
near
her
it
can
hardly
i
think
be
doubted
that
some
reaction
will
take
place
in
her
feelings
and
that
she
will
at
last
be
induced
to
treat
me
as
a
son
at
any
rate
sir
gilbert
not
even
your
generous
kindness
shall
induce
me
to
abandon
this
hope
till
i
feel
persuaded
that
it
is
a
vain
one
in
my
opinion
my
duty
and
my
interest
equally
dictate
this
line
of
conduct
and
if
so
you
are
the
last
man
in
the
world
to
dissuade
me
from
pursuing
it
whether
there
were
too
much
of
firm
decision
in
mowbray
manner
to
leave
any
hope
of
overcoming
it
or
that
sir
gilbert
was
really
convinced
by
his
arguments
was
difficult
to
decide
but
he
yielded
the
point
on
condition
that
the
two
girls
should
be
left
at
oakley
at
least
for
the
present
and
be
regulated
as
to
their
future
conduct
by
the
manner
in
which
affairs
went
on
at
the
park
this
being
settled
much
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
parties
lady
harrington
made
miss
torrington
describe
the
entrée
of
this
most
undesired
interloper
a
task
which
the
fair
rosalind
performed
with
great
spirit
though
she
confessed
that
the
impatient
feeling
to
which
she
yielded
in
leaving
the
room
was
now
a
cause
of
regret
as
she
had
lost
thereby
some
notable
traits
in
the
history
of
that
eventful
hour
lady
harrington
was
greatly
delighted
at
the
conduct
of
williams
and
when
charles
left
them
to
inform
cartwright
that
her
daughter
and
her
ward
had
accepted
an
invitation
to
remain
at
oakley
for
a
few
days
she
proposed
that
they
should
pay
her
a
visit
at
the
mowbray
arms
both
to
give
her
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
her
conduct
was
approved
and
likewise
to
give
her
the
comfort
of
knowing
that
helen
and
miss
torrington
were
for
the
present
removed
from
such
scenes
as
they
had
witnessed
the
night
before
it
was
about
two
in
the
afternoon
when
lady
carriage
drove
across
the
common
to
the
little
already
described
as
the
mowbray
arms
as
they
approached
they
perceived
several
persons
who
appeared
to
be
occupied
in
very
eager
and
deep
discussion
before
the
door
what
are
they
doing
there
said
lady
harrington
rosalind
put
forward
her
head
to
ascertain
this
but
in
an
instant
drew
it
back
again
exclaiming
cartwright
is
there
mr
cartwright
exclaimed
helen
turning
very
pale
oh
lady
harrington
do
not
let
me
see
him
lady
harrington
let
down
the
glass
behind
the
coachman
and
said
aloud
turn
round
instantly
and
drive
home
this
order
being
immediately
obeyed
the
party
escaped
the
sight
of
the
vicar
but
in
gaining
this
advantage
they
lost
that
of
beholding
a
scene
which
must
have
drawn
forth
a
smile
even
from
helen
herself
the
parties
engaged
in
it
were
freeman
her
daughter
sally
jem
the
an
elderly
traveller
called
forth
by
the
clamour
from
the
warm
comforts
of
freeman
fireside
and
cartwright
himself
a
short
retrospect
will
be
necessary
to
explain
his
business
there
as
soon
as
the
prayer
of
that
morning
had
reached
its
final
amen
for
as
the
of
it
consisted
chiefly
in
vehement
implorings
of
the
divine
favour
on
such
of
his
new
family
and
household
as
should
show
unto
him
the
most
perfect
submission
and
obedience
the
amen
to
make
assurance
doubly
sure
was
three
several
times
repeated
as
soon
however
as
it
was
finally
pronounced
the
vicar
his
lady
and
the
pale
fanny
sat
down
to
breakfast
it
would
be
tedious
to
tell
how
many
glances
of
furtive
but
delight
the
master
of
the
house
cast
on
each
and
every
of
the
minute
yet
not
unimportant
differences
between
this
and
any
others
at
which
he
had
occupied
a
place
of
equal
authority
suffice
it
to
say
that
there
were
many
the
meal
indeed
altogether
lasted
much
longer
than
usual
but
as
soon
as
it
was
ended
and
that
cartwright
had
watched
with
feelings
of
great
complacency
the
exit
of
its
component
parts
by
the
hands
of
two
footmen
and
a
butler
he
told
his
wife
that
he
should
be
obliged
though
most
unwillingly
to
leave
her
for
some
hours
as
there
were
many
things
to
which
his
personal
attention
was
required
will
the
rooms
be
ready
for
jacob
and
henrietta
my
love
they
are
quite
ready
now
my
dear
cartwright
when
may
we
hope
to
see
them
to
call
and
give
them
their
orders
about
coming
here
is
one
part
of
the
business
that
takes
me
from
you
my
sweet
clara
there
are
some
small
bills
in
the
village
too
with
which
your
happy
husband
must
not
be
dunned
sweet
love
what
have
you
dearest
in
the
house
of
money
i
have
very
little
indeed
said
cartwright
unlocking
her
desk
and
drawing
thence
a
purse
with
ten
or
twelve
sovereigns
in
it
i
pay
every
thing
by
drafts
by
far
the
best
way
my
love
but
your
drafts
dear
are
no
longer
worth
any
thing
and
i
must
therefore
see
corbold
to
give
orders
that
every
thing
is
put
right
about
that
at
the
banker
and
so
forth
and
this
must
really
be
done
without
delay
certainly
it
must
said
the
lady
shall
i
i
mean
will
you
send
one
of
the
men
to
wrexhill
to
bring
him
here
cartwright
laid
his
hand
on
the
bell
but
ere
he
pulled
it
checked
his
hand
and
said
no
i
must
walk
to
the
village
and
therefore
i
will
call
on
him
myself
shall
you
prefer
walking
my
dear
mr
cartwright
why
no
i
had
forgot
perhaps
it
would
be
as
well
to
take
the
carriage
oh
certainly
and
you
can
bring
henrietta
back
with
you
true
dear
she
will
certainly
want
the
carriage
i
will
go
and
send
her
and
her
bandboxes
back
in
it
and
then
perhaps
drive
myself
back
in
the
cab
it
is
at
the
vicarage
you
know
is
it
i
did
not
remember
that
then
how
are
they
gone
this
morning
those
undutiful
children
i
mean
who
have
chosen
to
set
off
this
morning
without
even
leaving
a
message
for
us
i
imagined
that
charles
had
packed
them
both
into
the
cab
as
he
has
often
done
his
sisters
do
not
waste
a
thought
on
them
my
beloved
clara
it
is
evident
that
they
have
neither
of
them
ever
felt
the
slightest
affection
for
you
and
would
it
not
be
worse
than
folly
for
you
beloved
and
adored
as
you
are
to
let
any
thought
of
them
come
to
blight
our
happiness
after
this
and
many
more
tender
and
affectionate
passages
had
passed
between
them
cartwright
set
off
for
the
vicarage
his
own
as
he
told
himself
more
than
once
as
he
drove
along
and
having
informed
his
son
and
daughter
not
greatly
to
the
surprise
of
either
that
mowbray
park
was
to
be
their
future
home
he
left
them
to
prepare
for
their
removal
telling
henrietta
that
he
would
send
his
carriage
back
from
corbold
where
it
should
set
him
down
and
that
she
might
fill
it
if
she
chose
with
her
own
luggage
as
he
should
drive
jacob
in
his
cab
at
corbold
the
conversation
was
rather
religious
and
moreover
extremely
satisfactory
to
both
parties
one
or
two
of
his
most
prayerful
parishioners
among
the
tradespeople
were
next
called
upon
and
permitted
to
offer
their
congratulations
and
thanksgivings
and
then
told
to
send
their
bills
to
the
park
after
this
the
reverend
bridegroom
walked
down
the
village
street
to
the
common
returning
the
humble
bowings
and
curtsyings
that
crossed
his
path
with
a
benignant
sweetness
of
countenance
that
spoke
much
of
the
placid
contentment
that
dwelt
within
it
was
not
however
solely
to
enjoy
this
pleasing
interchange
of
civility
that
he
directed
his
steps
along
this
path
though
that
was
something
but
for
the
purpose
also
of
transacting
a
little
business
with
freeman
the
prosperous
landlord
of
the
mowbray
arms
this
good
man
and
his
family
it
may
be
observed
had
been
great
favourites
with
the
family
of
wallace
the
late
vicar
but
stood
not
so
high
by
many
degrees
in
the
estimation
of
the
present
they
were
honest
industrious
regular
people
who
had
never
during
the
twenty
years
they
had
kept
the
village
inn
been
accused
or
even
suspected
of
having
neglected
a
sabbath
or
of
having
ever
permitted
any
indecorum
either
on
that
or
any
other
day
to
be
practised
under
their
roof
but
they
had
steadily
refused
to
attend
cartwright
tuesday
evening
expounding
and
his
thursday
evening
lecture
the
good
woman
who
was
no
bad
scholar
alleging
as
the
reason
for
this
that
they
knew
of
no
such
religious
service
being
enjoined
by
the
church
of
which
they
were
members
and
that
not
considering
themselves
in
any
way
called
upon
to
amend
the
ordinances
of
the
religion
in
which
they
were
born
and
bred
they
thought
it
more
according
to
their
condition
to
remain
at
home
and
endeavour
to
do
their
duty
in
that
state
of
life
to
which
it
had
pleased
god
to
call
them
this
explanation
having
been
very
clearly
and
distinctly
given
to
the
vicar
in
the
presence
of
several
witnesses
before
whom
he
had
intended
to
make
a
rather
marked
display
of
pastoral
piety
and
eloquence
though
uttered
with
very
becoming
modesty
and
respect
had
produced
an
impression
against
the
dorothy
and
all
her
household
never
to
be
forgotten
or
forgiven
cartwright
had
even
taken
the
trouble
of
waiting
upon
the
magistrates
of
the
neighbourhood
requesting
them
to
refuse
to
continue
freeman
licence
assuring
them
that
he
was
a
man
whose
character
was
likely
to
produce
a
very
demoralising
influence
on
his
parish
but
as
these
gentlemen
had
happened
to
know
the
good
man
for
many
years
they
begged
to
consider
of
it
and
the
vicar
of
wrexhill
was
thus
left
to
discover
other
ways
and
means
by
which
to
dislodge
his
obnoxious
parishioner
a
very
favourable
occasion
for
this
now
seemed
to
offer
itself
and
he
accordingly
proceeded
with
an
elastic
step
and
dignified
gait
towards
the
mowbray
arms
at
the
moment
he
appeared
in
sight
the
of
the
park
was
describing
to
freeman
and
her
daughter
sally
the
return
of
its
mistress
and
most
unwelcome
master
on
the
preceding
evening
why
here
he
comes
as
sure
as
i
live
exclaimed
dorothy
what
in
the
wide
world
can
bring
him
here
it
must
be
to
preachify
you
mrs
williams
and
that
what
he
shall
never
do
again
so
step
out
and
speak
to
him
outside
there
a
dear
good
woman
and
if
i
see
you
ca
get
rid
of
him
i
make
my
way
out
of
the
back
door
and
so
go
round
and
slip
in
again
and
up
to
my
own
room
before
he
can
catch
me
to
facilitate
this
escape
freeman
walked
forth
and
met
the
reverend
bridegroom
just
as
he
had
reached
the
foot
of
the
post
from
whence
depended
the
mowbray
arms
good
morning
freeman
he
said
in
the
peculiar
accent
in
which
he
always
addressed
those
who
were
not
to
use
his
own
phrase
of
his
father
house
a
tone
in
which
cold
outward
civility
was
struggling
with
hot
internal
hatred
good
morning
mrs
freeman
good
morning
sir
responded
freeman
with
a
very
proper
and
ceremonious
curtsy
i
have
called
to
mention
to
you
a
necessary
alteration
that
must
immediately
take
place
on
your
premises
you
must
forthwith
take
down
the
mowbray
arms
which
have
no
longer
any
connexion
with
the
neighbourhood
and
it
may
be
if
you
conduct
yourselves
properly
i
may
permit
you
to
substitute
the
cartwright
arms
i
believe
sir
said
freeman
in
a
tone
rather
too
much
approaching
to
indifference
that
a
publican
may
exhibit
what
sign
he
likes
provided
it
be
not
offensive
to
common
decency
and
i
think
there
may
be
a
many
she
added
turning
away
to
her
house
who
might
object
to
the
sign
you
propose
as
not
coming
within
that
line
she
had
made
a
step
or
two
towards
the
door
when
she
turned
again
upon
hearing
the
voice
of
the
vicar
raised
to
a
very
unusual
pitch
he
was
not
addressing
her
however
but
the
boy
jem
who
chanced
at
that
moment
to
be
entering
the
little
rickyard
with
a
ladder
upon
his
shoulder
bring
here
that
ladder
boy
vociferated
the
imperious
great
man
the
boy
obeyed
saying
as
he
drew
near
what
your
pleasure
sir
fix
your
ladder
against
this
post
d
hear
and
mount
steady
mind
and
take
the
sign
off
the
hooks
when
you
have
got
it
loose
you
may
let
it
drop
if
it
breaks
it
no
matter
it
is
of
no
farther
value
take
down
master
sign
your
honour
said
jem
opening
his
mouth
and
eyes
to
their
greatest
dimensions
but
not
approaching
an
inch
nearer
to
the
do
you
dispute
my
orders
you
little
ruffian
cried
the
holy
vicar
his
eyes
flashing
and
his
cane
raised
in
a
very
threatening
attitude
you
be
the
parson
of
the
parish
i
know
said
the
boy
looking
steadily
in
his
face
and
they
do
say
you
be
something
else
besides
now
but
i
do
see
that
a
reason
for
my
lugging
master
sign
down
at
this
moment
the
feelings
of
the
man
overcame
those
of
the
saint
and
cartwright
seizing
upon
the
ladder
succeeded
in
disengaging
it
from
the
boy
hands
and
himself
placing
it
against
the
post
had
already
got
one
foot
upon
it
when
freeman
stepped
back
and
taking
a
quiet
but
firm
hold
of
his
arm
said
it
is
a
trespass
and
a
damage
you
are
committing
sir
and
i
warn
you
to
desist
and
i
wish
with
all
my
heart
that
there
was
no
worser
trespass
and
damage
upon
your
conscience
or
at
least
that
there
was
still
as
good
time
to
stop
it
but
married
or
not
to
the
lady
we
wo
have
nothing
to
do
with
your
arms
cartwright
nor
your
legs
neither
if
you
please
sir
so
do
be
after
climbing
that
fashion
to
disturb
our
property
for
it
do
look
clerical
nohow
cartwright
raised
his
voice
much
beyond
its
usual
pitch
to
answer
and
at
this
moment
sally
and
the
traveller
moved
by
a
very
natural
feeling
of
curiosity
joined
the
group
why
what
the
gentleman
after
said
the
wayfaring
man
deliberately
taking
out
a
pair
of
huge
spectacles
to
examine
into
the
mystery
i
should
take
un
to
be
a
parson
by
his
cloth
only
i
never
did
hear
of
a
reverend
climbing
a
ladder
save
and
except
the
famous
dodd
as
i
read
of
in
the
newgate
calendar
this
harangue
short
as
it
was
saved
the
mowbray
arms
from
farther
molestation
for
the
present
for
the
vicar
withdrew
his
foot
but
the
glance
with
which
he
greeted
the
speaker
was
very
nearly
awful
dorothy
freeman
however
turned
on
her
heel
nothing
heeding
it
her
guest
and
daughter
followed
her
into
the
house
jem
quietly
took
up
his
ladder
and
proceeded
on
his
business
and
the
vicar
of
wrexhill
with
feelings
which
the
hope
of
future
vengeance
alone
enabled
him
to
endure
with
decent
philosophy
was
fain
to
turn
on
his
heel
also
and
walk
off
end
of
the
second
volume
volume
the
third
chapter
and
cartwright
letter
the
very
elegant
cab
with
its
beautiful
horse
and
accoutrements
led
round
to
the
door
of
the
vicarage
as
his
own
the
agreeable
vivacity
as
he
always
thought
it
of
his
remarkably
clever
son
the
multitude
of
low
bows
and
lower
curtsies
which
greeted
him
as
he
drove
along
and
above
all
perhaps
the
merry
peal
from
the
church
tower
which
had
been
ordered
by
himself
to
ring
him
into
mowbray
park
produced
altogether
so
favourable
an
effect
upon
the
nerves
of
the
vicar
that
when
he
stopped
at
the
portico
of
his
mansion
his
spirits
and
his
temper
appeared
altogether
to
have
recovered
the
shock
they
had
received
at
the
foot
of
the
the
family
party
which
met
at
dinner
consisted
of
and
cartwright
miss
cartwright
jacob
cartwright
and
poor
charles
mowbray
and
his
sister
fanny
mowbray
thought
the
genial
hour
of
dinner
might
probably
be
the
most
favourable
for
mentioning
the
invitation
of
sir
gilbert
and
lady
harrington
to
his
sister
and
miss
torrington
an
idea
which
probably
occurred
to
him
in
consequence
of
the
remarkably
well
pleased
and
complaisant
air
visible
on
his
stepfather
countenance
as
he
took
his
place
at
the
bottom
of
the
table
poor
charles
he
made
this
observation
and
he
determined
to
profit
by
it
though
it
was
not
without
a
pang
that
he
saw
himself
thus
pushed
from
the
stool
that
nature
and
fortune
seemed
to
have
assigned
to
him
i
am
glad
thought
he
that
the
proud
rosalind
who
advised
me
to
lay
my
fortune
at
the
feet
of
no
one
is
not
here
to
witness
the
moment
at
which
i
take
my
place
at
my
father
board
lord
of
my
presence
and
no
land
beside
but
his
young
spirit
soon
mastered
the
sensation
which
seemed
threatening
to
choke
him
when
cartwright
said
in
the
most
obliging
voice
in
the
world
charles
let
me
give
you
some
soup
this
over
he
said
with
the
easiest
accent
he
could
assume
and
addressing
his
mother
i
am
the
bearer
of
a
message
from
lady
harrington
she
hopes
that
you
will
spare
her
the
society
of
miss
torrington
and
helen
for
a
short
time
cartwright
looked
at
her
husband
to
ascertain
his
sentiments
before
she
ventured
to
have
any
of
her
own
it
is
very
considerate
of
the
old
lady
said
the
vicar
with
a
soft
smile
of
which
his
daughter
only
knew
the
full
value
i
dare
say
she
thought
we
should
be
a
good
deal
engaged
just
at
first
chivers
do
you
see
jacob
cartwright
is
waiting
for
sauce
i
think
my
love
we
shall
make
no
objection
to
the
arrangement
however
we
will
talk
together
on
the
subject
before
we
decide
as
this
amiable
speech
will
not
be
found
to
accord
exactly
with
his
subsequent
conduct
it
may
be
well
to
remark
that
the
servants
were
waiting
at
table
who
doubtless
would
report
his
answer
and
speculate
on
the
temper
of
it
the
family
party
seemed
expected
to
sit
at
table
rather
longer
than
usual
the
master
of
the
banquet
was
evidently
enjoying
himself
and
though
charles
sickened
alike
at
his
dignity
and
his
condescension
and
henrietta
looked
more
pale
and
fanny
more
melancholy
every
moment
still
jacob
appeared
in
ecstacies
and
as
cartwright
continued
to
smile
upon
her
handsome
husband
with
every
symptom
of
satisfaction
he
continued
to
perform
his
new
and
delightful
task
at
the
bottom
of
the
table
till
long
past
the
usual
hour
of
withdrawing
at
length
however
the
watchful
bride
received
the
little
nod
which
her
husband
had
that
morning
informed
her
must
always
precede
her
moving
from
table
the
ladies
retired
and
charles
followed
them
as
far
as
the
hall
where
impatiently
seizing
upon
his
hat
and
wrapping
himself
in
his
cloak
he
set
off
despite
the
heavy
darkness
of
the
night
to
relieve
his
heart
from
the
load
that
oppressed
it
by
passing
an
hour
at
oakley
cartwright
and
jacob
remained
in
the
for
another
very
delightful
and
then
followed
coffee
and
tea
and
fanny
own
hymns
sung
to
irish
melodies
and
a
few
conjugal
kindnesses
exchanged
on
the
sofa
and
henrietta
pleaded
illness
and
went
to
bed
and
then
another
very
appropriate
extempore
prayer
was
uttered
and
the
family
separated
will
you
not
take
a
little
wine
and
water
and
a
biscuit
my
dear
mr
cartwright
said
his
attentive
wife
you
always
used
to
do
it
i
had
rather
the
tray
were
taken
to
your
my
love
there
was
something
so
affectionately
comfortable
in
the
proposition
that
the
lady
added
a
tender
smile
to
her
nodded
assent
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
pair
found
themselves
in
robes
de
chambre
luxuriously
seated
in
two
soft
before
a
blazing
fire
in
the
very
room
that
a
few
short
weeks
before
had
witnessed
the
first
full
disclosure
of
the
vicar
love
madeira
sugar
nutmeg
hot
water
and
dainty
biscuits
tempted
to
negus
and
to
chat
and
thus
the
conversation
ran
only
second
to
my
service
to
the
lord
my
clara
is
my
adoration
of
you
began
the
fond
husband
and
in
nothing
perhaps
shall
i
be
more
likely
to
show
this
than
in
the
pains
i
shall
almost
involuntarily
take
to
guard
you
from
every
spiteful
and
envious
observation
which
our
union
sweetest
is
likely
to
excite
it
was
in
this
spirit
my
beauteous
clara
that
i
replied
in
the
manner
i
did
to
the
message
from
those
very
infamous
people
the
harringtons
had
i
my
love
at
once
proclaimed
my
feelings
on
the
subject
i
well
knew
what
the
result
would
be
you
would
have
been
abused
throughout
the
country
for
having
married
a
tyrant
whose
first
act
of
power
was
to
vex
and
thwart
your
children
therefore
when
your
sweet
eyes
looked
towards
mine
for
the
purpose
of
consulting
me
i
at
once
decided
upon
the
line
of
conduct
most
certain
of
securing
you
from
any
invidious
remark
how
very
kind
my
dearest
husband
i
must
pray
for
power
to
prove
my
gratitude
for
such
kindness
as
i
ought
sweet
love
together
will
we
pray
together
learn
how
best
to
prove
the
virtuous
tenderness
of
our
souls
but
do
not
my
clara
suspect
me
guilty
of
the
contemptible
weakness
of
really
intending
that
your
daughter
and
your
ward
should
remain
inmates
in
a
family
that
has
so
cruelly
insulted
you
oh
do
not
believe
it
no
i
would
rather
submit
to
insult
myself
in
the
most
painful
form
than
permit
you
my
best
beloved
to
encounter
it
unresisted
you
must
write
my
clara
you
must
write
a
letter
to
helen
and
send
it
with
the
carriage
early
morning
to
oakley
it
must
be
such
a
letter
dearest
as
shall
bring
her
home
without
an
hour
delay
but
my
dearest
cartwright
charles
is
gone
there
you
may
depend
upon
it
and
probably
for
the
express
purpose
of
telling
the
girls
how
graciously
you
received
the
invitation
you
think
so
my
clara
i
own
i
hoped
it
was
the
case
this
you
see
is
exactly
what
we
could
most
wish
to
happen
my
answer
was
spoken
precisely
in
the
spirit
which
i
thought
could
be
repeated
most
favourably
for
you
now
therefore
your
asserting
a
mother
rights
and
a
mother
feelings
must
do
you
honour
even
in
the
eyes
of
those
you
disoblige
and
no
sort
of
reflection
fall
upon
the
blessed
choice
which
has
made
me
the
happiest
of
men
that
was
so
thoughtful
of
you
replied
cartwright
kissing
the
hand
that
clasped
hers
but
what
shall
i
say
to
helen
dearest
give
me
your
desk
my
clara
and
i
will
write
a
line
or
two
that
you
shall
copy
it
must
be
expressed
with
strength
and
firmness
my
best
love
and
it
may
prevent
a
repetition
of
this
very
improper
request
for
the
future
the
desk
was
brought
and
while
cartwright
prepared
a
second
glass
of
negus
for
the
vicar
who
declared
that
the
night
was
unusually
chilly
he
composed
the
following
epistle
helen
that
it
should
have
entered
into
your
heart
into
the
heart
of
my
own
dear
child
to
wish
for
permission
to
become
the
guest
of
a
family
who
from
the
hour
of
your
late
father
death
has
ever
treated
me
with
the
most
cruel
and
unmerited
unkindness
is
a
mystery
that
i
can
not
understand
it
was
this
unkindness
which
drove
me
sooner
than
i
could
have
wished
to
do
it
to
find
a
friend
and
adviser
in
cartwright
and
my
only
fear
now
is
that
his
indulgent
gentleness
towards
my
children
may
prevent
his
being
so
firm
a
support
to
me
in
the
guiding
them
as
i
may
sometimes
require
but
in
the
present
instance
i
want
no
strength
beyond
my
own
to
declare
to
you
that
i
will
not
permit
you
to
remain
an
hour
longer
at
sir
gilbert
harrington
that
i
command
you
instantly
to
put
yourself
into
the
carriage
i
send
for
you
and
return
to
cartwright
park
for
so
of
course
will
my
residence
be
called
for
the
future
and
moreover
i
beg
you
to
inform
the
unprincipled
pair
who
would
seduce
you
from
your
mother
roof
that
if
on
the
present
or
any
future
occasion
they
should
persuade
you
to
commit
so
great
a
sin
i
shall
take
legal
measures
to
recover
the
possession
of
your
person
till
such
time
as
you
shall
be
of
age
when
if
unhappily
evil
counsellors
should
still
have
influence
over
you
i
shall
give
you
up
to
them
to
penniless
obscurity
to
your
own
heart
remorse
and
to
that
sentence
of
everlasting
condemnation
which
will
in
such
case
infallibly
doom
you
to
the
region
where
there
is
howling
and
gnashing
of
teeth
as
for
my
ward
miss
torrington
i
must
of
course
take
the
same
summary
mode
of
getting
her
again
under
my
protection
for
such
time
as
i
shall
continue
to
be
her
legal
guardian

wednesday
when
this
composition
was
completed
cartwright
turned
the
desk
to
his
lady
laid
a
fair
sheet
of
blank
paper
before
her
put
a
pen
into
her
hand
drew
the
near
her
and
then
set
about
sipping
the
negus
she
had
so
kindly
prepared
for
him
without
appearing
to
think
it
at
all
necessary
to
ask
her
opinion
of
the
document
she
was
about
to
copy
being
however
rather
new
to
the
yoke
into
which
it
had
pleased
her
to
thrust
her
head
she
took
the
liberty
of
reading
it
a
slight
augmentation
of
colour
was
perceived
on
her
delicate
cheek
as
she
proceeded
by
the
watchful
eye
of
her
husband
as
he
turned
it
towards
her
over
the
top
of
the
beautifully
cut
goblet
he
held
in
his
hand
but
he
nibbled
a
biscuit
and
said
nothing
when
the
perusal
of
it
was
completed
cartwright
dipped
the
pen
she
still
held
between
her
fingers
in
the
ink
but
before
she
began
to
use
it
she
paused
the
colour
mounted
a
little
higher
still
and
she
ventured
to
say
in
the
very
gentlest
accent
in
the
world
my
dear
friend
do
you
not
think
this
might
be
a
little
softened
as
how
my
sweetest
cartwright
eye
again
ran
over
it
but
she
seemed
unwilling
to
speak
at
length
she
said
if
you
dear
cartwright
agree
with
me
about
it
you
would
make
the
alteration
so
much
better
yourself
perhaps
i
might
my
lovely
clara
but
as
the
fact
is
that
i
do
not
agree
with
you
at
all
on
the
subject
i
suspect
your
epistle
would
be
rather
the
worse
than
the
better
for
any
thing
further
that
i
could
do
to
it
he
rose
as
he
spoke
and
going
behind
her
appeared
to
read
the
paper
over
her
shoulder
and
having
satisfied
himself
with
the
examination
kissed
her
fair
throat
as
he
bent
over
it
adding
as
he
took
a
light
from
the
table
i
am
going
to
the
library
to
look
for
a
book
my
love
write
it
exactly
as
you
like
and
i
will
seal
it
for
you
when
i
return
no
one
who
knew
cartwright
could
have
the
slightest
doubt
that
the
letter
would
be
very
fairly
copied
by
the
time
her
obliging
husband
returned
and
so
it
was
every
word
of
it
excepting
the
date
she
appeared
to
be
in
the
very
act
of
writing
this
when
he
came
back
and
stopping
short
as
he
entered
she
said
in
a
voice
that
certainly
faltered
a
little
my
dear
cartwright
do
you
think
it
would
be
better
to
let
those
odious
harringtons
hear
from
some
other
quarter
of
this
change
in
the
name
of
our
place
not
but
that
i
approve
it
i
assure
you
perfectly
but
i
know
lady
harrington
so
well
and
i
can
guess
so
exactly
the
sort
of
style
in
which
she
will
observe
upon
it
then
perhaps
dearest
said
he
again
coming
behind
her
and
caressing
her
neck
perhaps
you
may
think
it
would
please
her
ladyship
better
if
your
own
name
as
you
have
accepted
it
from
me
were
to
be
suppressed
is
it
so
my
fairest
good
heaven
no
may
i
be
forgiven
for
using
such
an
expression
cartwright
how
could
you
say
such
cruel
words
nay
my
own
clara
what
could
i
think
of
your
wishing
that
the
house
we
dwell
in
should
retain
the
name
of
your
former
husband
ah
dearest
you
know
not
all
the
jealousy
of
affection
so
ardent
as
mine
what
is
the
importance
of
the
name
of
the
place
clara
compared
to
your
own
are
you
not
mine
he
continued
throwing
his
arms
round
her
and
if
you
are
why
should
you
torture
me
with
the
remembrance
that
another
has
called
you
his
that
another
name
has
been
your
signature
your
date
your
history
oh
clara
spare
me
such
thoughts
as
these
they
unman
me
my
dearest
cartwright
returned
the
lady
only
disengaging
herself
from
his
arms
sufficiently
to
write
with
firm
though
hurried
characters
the
name
of
cartwright
park
how
deeply
you
have
touched
me
chapter
ii
the
widow
simpson
disappointment
this
letter
was
certainly
commented
upon
pretty
freely
in
all
its
parts
by
the
knight
and
lady
of
oakley
but
not
the
less
did
it
produce
the
effect
intended
for
not
even
could
sir
gilbert
after
the
first
hot
fit
of
rage
was
over
advise
poor
helen
to
expose
herself
to
be
recalled
by
force
in
the
case
of
miss
torrington
the
hated
authority
of
cartwright
though
not
necessarily
so
lasting
was
for
the
present
equally
imperative
and
he
therefore
advised
her
peaceably
to
accompany
her
friend
to
her
unhappy
home
and
then
to
set
about
applying
to
chancery
in
order
to
emancipate
herself
from
it
the
parting
was
a
very
sad
one
poor
helen
wept
bitterly
she
had
felt
more
consolation
perhaps
than
she
was
aware
in
having
been
received
with
such
very
kindness
at
oakley
and
her
present
departure
from
it
was
she
thought
exceedingly
like
being
driven
or
rather
dragged
out
of
paradise
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
the
carriage
was
waiting
at
the
door
and
even
the
rebellious
sir
gilbert
himself
said
she
must
go
not
without
adding
however
that
it
should
go
hard
with
him
if
he
did
not
find
some
means
or
other
before
she
were
of
releasing
her
from
such
hateful
thraldom
helen
had
given
as
she
thought
her
last
kiss
to
her
godmother
and
was
in
the
very
act
of
stepping
aside
that
miss
torrington
might
take
her
place
in
the
carriage
when
that
young
lady
blushing
most
celestial
rosy
red
said
abruptly
as
if
prompted
thereto
by
a
sudden
and
desperate
effort
of
courage
sir
gilbert
harrington
may
i
speak
to
you
for
one
single
minute
alone
for
a
double
century
fair
rose
if
we
can
but
make
the
last
so
you
may
give
poor
another
hug
helen
and
hurry
yourself
about
it
miss
rose
and
i
shall
find
a
great
deal
to
say
to
each
other
as
soon
as
the
old
baronet
had
completed
the
flourish
with
which
he
led
her
into
his
library
miss
torrington
turned
to
him
and
with
a
voice
and
manner
that
betrayed
great
agitation
she
said
i
believe
sir
gilbert
i
may
change
my
present
guardian
by
applying
to
the
court
of
chancery
if
i
make
myself
a
ward
of
the
court
it
will
be
necessary
i
believe
for
me
to
obtain
the
lord
chancellor
consent
if
i
should
wish
to
marry
before
i
am
of
age
certainly
my
dear
and
what
is
necessary
for
the
obtaining
such
consent
sir
gilbert
that
the
person
who
proposes
to
marry
you
should
be
able
to
offer
settlements
in
proportion
to
your
own
fortune
and
if
i
should
choose
a
person
unable
to
do
so
to
guard
against
such
imprudence
miss
torrington
the
chancellor
has
the
power
of
preventing
such
a
marriage
rosalind
colour
came
and
went
and
came
again
before
she
could
utter
another
word
but
at
length
she
said
have
i
not
the
power
of
choosing
another
guardian
sir
gilbert
i
believe
you
have
my
dear
if
i
have
then
will
you
let
me
choose
you
these
words
burst
so
eagerly
from
her
and
she
clasped
her
hands
and
fixed
eyes
upon
him
with
a
look
so
supplicating
that
no
man
would
have
found
it
an
easy
task
to
refuse
her
sir
gilbert
probably
felt
little
inclination
to
do
so
though
he
had
in
the
course
of
his
life
repeatedly
refused
to
take
the
office
now
offered
him
in
so
singular
a
manner
this
request
my
dear
miss
rose
said
he
smiling
looks
very
much
as
if
you
thought
i
should
prove
such
an
old
fool
of
a
guardian
as
to
let
you
have
your
own
way
in
all
things
i
hardly
know
whether
i
ought
to
thank
you
for
the
compliment
or
not
however
i
am
very
willing
to
accept
the
office
for
i
think
somehow
or
other
that
you
will
not
plague
me
what
is
your
fortune
my
dear
and
is
it
english
or
irish
property
entirely
english
sir
gilbert
and
produces
i
believe
between
three
and
four
thousand
a
year
a
very
pretty
provision
my
dear
young
lady
would
you
wish
to
proceed
in
this
immediately
immediately
without
a
day
delay
if
i
could
help
it
sir
gilbert
patted
her
cheek
and
smiled
again
with
a
look
of
very
great
contentment
and
satisfaction
very
well
my
dear
i
think
you
are
quite
right
quite
right
to
get
rid
of
such
a
guardian
as
the
reverend
mistress
cartwright
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
i
imagine
you
would
not
find
it
very
easy
to
negotiate
the
business
yourself
and
i
will
therefore
recommend
my
lawyer
to
you
shall
i
put
the
business
into
his
hands
forthwith
so
bright
a
flash
of
pleasure
darted
from
the
eyes
of
rosalind
as
made
the
old
gentleman
wink
his
own
and
in
truth
he
appeared
very
nearly
as
well
pleased
as
herself
now
then
she
said
holding
her
hand
towards
him
that
he
might
lead
her
out
again
i
will
keep
cartwright
carriage
waiting
no
bless
you
sir
gilbert
do
not
talk
to
any
body
about
this
till
it
is
done
oh
how
very
kind
you
are
sir
gilbert
gallantly
and
gaily
kissed
the
tips
of
her
fingers
and
led
her
again
into
the
helen
who
was
still
weeping
and
seemed
as
much
determined
to
persevere
in
it
as
ever
beatrice
did
looked
with
astonishment
in
the
face
of
her
friend
which
though
still
covered
with
blushes
was
radiant
with
joy
it
was
in
vain
she
looked
at
her
however
it
was
a
mystery
she
could
not
solve
so
once
more
uttering
a
mournful
farewell
helen
gave
a
last
melancholy
gaze
at
her
old
friends
and
followed
rosalind
into
the
carriage
may
i
ask
you
rosalind
she
said
as
soon
as
it
drove
off
what
it
is
that
you
have
been
saying
to
sir
gilbert
or
sir
gilbert
to
you
which
can
have
caused
you
to
look
so
particularly
happy
at
the
moment
that
you
are
about
to
take
up
your
residence
at
cartwright
park
under
the
guardianship
of
its
master
the
vicar
of
wrexhill
i
will
explain
the
mystery
in
a
moment
helen
i
have
asked
sir
gilbert
harrington
to
let
me
name
him
as
my
guardian
and
he
has
consented
have
you
such
power
replied
helen
oh
happy
happy
rosalind
yes
helen
there
may
be
happiness
in
that
but
i
may
find
difficulties
perhaps
and
if
i
do
i
trust
you
will
i
trust
that
ere
long
you
will
be
able
to
withdraw
yourself
from
a
house
so
disgraced
and
afflicted
as
ours
and
leave
you
behind
helen
you
think
that
is
part
of
my
scheme
how
can
you
help
it
rosalind
you
have
just
read
my
my
letter
you
see
the
style
and
tone
in
which
she
announces
her
right
over
and
this
from
the
mother
i
so
doated
on
i
do
assure
you
rosalind
that
i
often
seem
to
doubt
the
reality
of
the
misery
that
surrounds
me
and
fancy
that
i
must
be
dreaming
throw
back
your
thoughts
to
the
period
of
your
first
coming
to
us
and
then
say
if
such
a
letter
as
this
can
really
come
to
me
from
my
mother
the
letter
is
a
queer
letter
a
very
queer
letter
indeed
and
yet
i
am
under
infinite
obligations
to
it
for
had
she
not
used
that
pretty
phrase
such
time
as
i
shall
continue
to
be
her
legal
guardian
it
might
never
have
entered
my
head
to
inquire
for
how
long
a
time
that
must
of
necessity
be
i
rejoice
for
you
rosalind
that
the
odious
necessity
of
remaining
with
us
is
likely
to
be
shortened
and
will
mix
no
malice
with
my
envy
even
when
i
see
you
turn
your
back
for
ever
upon
cartwright
park
there
would
be
little
cause
to
envy
me
helen
should
i
go
without
taking
you
with
me
a
tear
stood
in
rosalind
bright
eye
as
she
said
this
and
helen
felt
very
heartily
ashamed
of
the
petulance
with
which
she
had
spoken
as
a
penance
for
it
she
would
not
utter
the
sad
prognostic
that
rose
to
her
lips
as
to
the
impossibility
that
any
thing
could
give
her
power
to
bestow
the
freedom
she
might
herself
obtain
their
return
seemed
to
be
unnoticed
by
every
individual
of
the
family
except
henrietta
she
saw
the
carriage
approach
from
her
own
room
and
continued
to
waylay
rosalind
as
she
passed
to
hers
i
know
the
sight
of
me
must
be
hateful
to
you
miss
torrington
she
said
and
i
have
been
looking
out
for
you
in
order
that
the
shock
of
first
seeing
me
might
be
over
at
once
poor
pretty
helen
mowbray
notwithstanding
the
hardness
of
heart
on
which
i
pique
myself
i
can
not
help
feeling
for
her
how
does
she
bear
it
miss
torrington
she
is
very
unhappy
henrietta
and
i
think
it
is
your
duty
as
well
as
mine
to
make
her
feel
her
altered
home
as
little
miserable
as
possible
i
should
think
so
too
if
i
believed
i
had
any
power
to
make
it
better
or
worse
except
indeed
that
of
meeting
her
eyes
or
avoiding
them
the
sight
of
any
of
us
must
be
dreadful
to
her
you
have
such
a
remarkable
way
of
shutting
yourself
up
your
intellectual
self
i
mean
from
every
one
that
it
is
not
very
easy
to
say
how
great
or
how
little
your
power
might
be
from
the
slight
and
transient
glances
which
you
have
sometimes
permitted
me
to
take
through
your
icy
casing
i
am
rather
inclined
to
believe
that
you
ought
to
reckon
for
something
in
the
family
of
which
you
make
a
part
henrietta
shook
her
head
your
glances
have
not
penetrated
to
the
centre
yet
miss
torrington
should
you
ever
do
so
you
and
your
friend
helen
too
would
hate
me
even
if
my
name
were
not
cartwright
i
would
not
hear
your
enemy
say
so
replied
rosalind
however
we
are
now
likely
to
be
enough
together
to
judge
each
other
by
the
severest
of
all
tests
daily
experience
an
excellent
test
for
the
temper
but
not
for
the
heart
replied
henrietta
you
seem
determined
to
make
me
afraid
of
you
miss
cartwright
i
have
no
great
experience
of
human
nature
as
yet
but
i
should
think
a
corrupt
heart
would
rather
seek
to
conceal
than
proclaim
itself
i
think
you
are
right
but
i
have
no
idea
that
my
heart
is
corrupt
it
is
diseased
i
wish
i
could
heal
it
said
rosalind
kindly
for
i
suspect
its
illness
be
it
what
it
may
causes
your
cheek
to
grow
pale
you
do
not
look
well
miss
cartwright
well
oh
no
i
have
long
known
i
am
dying
good
heaven
what
do
you
mean
why
do
you
not
take
advice
because
no
advice
could
save
me
and
because
if
it
could
i
would
not
take
it
i
hope
you
are
not
in
earnest
perhaps
this
strange
marriage
if
it
do
no
other
good
may
benefit
your
health
by
placing
you
in
a
larger
family
i
can
not
think
you
are
happy
at
the
vicarage
indeed
replied
henrietta
with
a
melancholy
smile
and
i
can
not
but
hope
that
you
will
be
more
happy
here
well
we
shall
see
but
i
should
take
it
very
kind
of
you
if
you
would
make
the
three
young
mowbrays
understand
that
if
i
could
have
prevented
this
iniquitous
marriage
i
would
have
done
it
would
it
be
safe
to
say
so
much
to
fanny
yes
cartwright
will
never
hear
her
bosom
secrets
more
in
the
midst
of
the
tide
of
triumph
and
of
joy
which
seemed
at
this
time
to
bear
the
vicar
of
wrexhill
far
above
the
reach
of
any
earthly
sorrow
there
was
a
little
private
annoyance
that
beset
him
very
trifling
indeed
but
which
required
a
touch
of
his
able
diplomatic
adroitness
to
settle
satisfactorily
the
widow
simpson
was
as
thorough
a
coquette
as
ever
decorated
the
street
of
a
country
village
and
often
had
it
happened
since
her
weeds
were
laid
aside
that
mr
this
or
that
had
been
congratulated
as
likely
to
succeed
to
her
vacant
heart
and
hand
but
hitherto
simpson
had
preferred
the
reputation
of
having
many
adorers
to
the
humdrum
reality
of
a
second
husband
but
when
cartwright
appeared
her
hopes
her
wishes
her
feelings
underwent
a
sudden
and
violent
change
at
first
indeed
she
only
looked
at
him
as
a
very
handsome
man
who
must
by
some
means
or
other
be
brought
to
think
her
a
very
handsome
woman
but
more
serious
thoughts
quickly
followed
and
the
idea
of
a
home
at
the
vicarage
and
the
advantage
of
having
all
her
bills
made
out
to
the
rev
cartwright
became
one
of
daily
and
hourly
recurrence
simpson
was
not
a
person
to
let
such
a
notion
lie
idle
nor
was
cartwright
a
man
to
permit
the
gentle
advances
to
intimacy
of
a
simpson
stop
short
or
lead
to
nothing
but
from
any
idea
of
her
becoming
mistress
of
the
vicarage
or
of
her
bills
being
made
out
to
him
he
was
as
pure
as
the
angels
in
heaven
nevertheless
the
intimacy
did
advance
one
by
one
every
personal
decoration
that
marks
the
worldling
was
laid
aside
and
the
livery
of
holiness
adopted
in
its
stead
false
ringlets
were
exchanged
for
false
bands
gauze
bonnets
covered
with
bows
gave
place
to
straw
bonnets
having
no
bows
at
all
lilac
faded
into
grey
and
the
colour
of
the
rose
was
exchanged
for
that
of
its
leaf
these
important
and
very
reforms
were
soon
followed
by
others
not
more
essential
for
that
is
hardly
possible
but
they
went
the
length
of
turning
her
little
girl
into
a
methodist
monkey
her
into
branch
missionary
fund
contribution
cases
her
footstools
into
praying
cushions
and
her
sofa
into
a
pulpit
and
a
pew
whence
and
where
she
very
often
listened
to
the
word
when
pretty
nearly
all
the
parish
of
wrexhill
were
fast
asleep
in
all
former
affairs
of
the
heart
in
which
simpson
had
engaged
since
the
demise
of
her
husband
she
had
uniformly
come
off
the
conqueror
for
she
had
never
failed
to
obtain
exactly
as
much
flirtation
as
she
required
to
keep
her
on
good
terms
with
herself
and
on
bad
terms
with
all
coquettish
young
ladies
for
five
miles
round
and
never
had
granted
any
favour
in
return
that
she
did
not
consider
as
a
fair
price
for
the
distinction
she
received
but
poor
simpson
example
should
be
a
warning
to
all
widow
ladies
to
be
careful
how
they
enter
into
holy
dalliance
and
sanctified
trifling
with
the
elect
common
prudence
in
short
is
no
fair
match
for
uncommon
holiness
and
the
principal
person
in
the
village
of
wrexhill
was
at
the
time
of
mowbray
marriage
with
its
vicar
really
very
much
to
be
pitied
it
is
probably
no
very
agreeable
task
for
a
bridegroom
to
pay
a
visit
to
a
lady
under
such
circumstances
but
cartwright
felt
that
it
must
be
done
and
with
nerves
braced
to
the
task
by
the
remembrance
of
the
splendid
silver
urn
tea
and
coffee
pots
the
exquisite
french
china
and
all
the
pretty
elaborate
finishing
of
his
breakfast
equipage
in
a
word
at
about
eleven
on
the
next
morning
but
one
after
his
installation
as
jacob
called
it
he
set
off
on
foot
like
an
humble
and
penitent
pilgrim
to
call
on
the
widow
simpson
he
was
as
usual
shown
into
the
quiet
parlour
overlooked
by
no
village
eye
that
opened
upon
the
garden
here
he
found
every
thing
much
as
it
used
to
be
sofas
footstools
albums
missionary
boxes
and
all
but
no
simpson
let
missis
know
sir
said
the
and
he
closed
the
door
leaving
the
vicar
to
his
meditations
at
length
the
door
reopened
and
the
pale
and
languid
simpson
her
eyes
red
with
weeping
and
her
rouge
not
partially
as
during
the
process
of
election
but
really
and
altogether
laid
aside
entered
the
air
and
manner
with
which
the
vicar
met
her
was
something
of
a
mixed
breed
between
audacity
and
confusion
he
was
in
circumstances
however
highly
favourable
to
the
growth
of
the
former
and
equally
so
to
the
stifling
of
the
latter
feeling
he
took
the
widow
hand
kissed
it
and
led
her
to
the
sofa
her
handkerchief
was
at
her
eyes
and
though
she
made
no
resistance
she
manifested
no
inclination
to
return
the
tender
pressure
bestowed
upon
her
fingers
you
weep
my
dear
friend
said
the
vicar
in
an
accent
of
surprise
is
it
thus
you
congratulate
me
on
the
great
change
that
has
taken
place
in
my
circumstances
congratulate
you
oh
cartwright
is
it
possible
that
you
can
be
so
coldly
cruel
congratulate
you
gracious
heaven
have
you
no
thought
no
pity
for
all
the
anguish
that
you
have
made
me
suffer
i
know
not
why
you
should
talk
of
suffering
my
dear
friend
i
had
hoped
that
the
sweet
friendship
which
for
several
months
past
has
united
us
was
to
you
as
to
me
a
source
of
the
tenderest
satisfaction
but
our
feelings
for
each
other
must
indeed
be
widely
different
there
is
no
circumstance
that
could
befall
you
productive
of
even
worldly
convenience
and
advantage
but
i
should
rejoice
at
it
as
if
sent
to
myself
but
you
my
friend
appear
to
mourn
because
from
a
poor
man
i
am
become
a
rich
one
alas
cruel
is
it
for
that
i
mourn
think
you
that
my
heart
can
forget
what
i
have
been
to
you
or
what
i
hoped
to
be
can
you
forget
the
hours
that
you
have
devoted
to
me
and
is
this
the
end
of
it
i
neither
can
nor
will
forget
the
happy
period
of
our
tender
friendship
nor
is
there
any
reason
my
excellent
simpson
that
it
should
not
continue
even
as
the
lord
hath
permitted
that
it
should
begin
believe
me
that
were
a
similar
circumstance
to
happen
to
you
i
mean
were
you
accidentally
to
connect
yourself
by
means
of
marriage
with
great
wealth
and
extended
influence
instead
of
complaining
of
it
i
should
rejoice
with
an
exceeding
great
joy
it
could
as
i
should
imagine
make
no
possible
difference
in
our
friendly
and
affectionate
feelings
for
each
other
and
i
should
know
that
your
piety
and
zeal
in
the
cause
of
grace
and
faith
would
be
rendered
greatly
more
profitable
and
efficient
thereby
you
do
not
then
understand
a
woman
heart
cartwright
what
is
there
short
of
the
torments
of
the
bottomless
pit
that
can
compare
to
the
suffering
of
seeing
the
heart
one
believed
to
be
one
own
given
to
another
i
dare
say
it
must
be
very
disagreeable
indeed
my
dear
friend
but
no
such
idea
i
do
assure
you
would
occur
to
me
were
you
to
marry
indeed
my
own
view
of
the
case
is
that
as
an
holy
ordinance
it
should
be
entered
into
with
as
little
attention
as
possible
to
mere
pleasure
to
a
man
like
myself
whose
heart
is
altogether
given
to
things
above
the
idea
of
making
a
marriage
of
love
as
it
is
called
would
be
equally
absurd
and
profane
my
object
in
the
connexion
i
have
just
formed
was
to
increase
my
sphere
of
influence
and
utility
and
nothing
i
assure
you
can
be
more
opportune
and
fortunate
than
my
having
found
this
very
worthy
and
person
it
would
give
me
unfeigned
satisfaction
my
dear
friend
to
hear
that
you
had
been
equally
fortunate
and
permit
me
to
say
equally
wise
oh
cartwright
i
am
sure
i
had
no
idea
when
when
i
attached
myself
to
you
that
you
disapproved
of
marriage
among
those
who
love
as
i
thought
you
and
i
did
for
most
surely
i
thought
cartwright
that
i
should
have
been
your
wife
no
is
it
possible
my
dear
friend
that
such
an
idea
as
that
so
perfectly
unauthorized
could
have
occurred
to
you
i
really
am
greatly
surprised
for
i
thought
that
we
understood
one
another
perfectly
indeed
indeed
cartwright
i
never
was
more
mistaken
in
any
one
in
my
whole
life
and
i
am
sure
that
if
poor
mowbray
is
as
much
deceived
in
you
as
i
was
she
will
be
a
very
unhappy
woman
when
she
finds
it
out
poor
thing
my
dear
friend
allow
me
to
assure
you
that
you
altogether
mistake
the
nature
of
the
friendship
i
have
been
so
happy
as
to
form
with
you
as
well
as
that
of
the
connexion
i
have
just
ratified
with
her
i
trust
the
lord
will
give
me
grace
so
to
conduct
myself
as
that
i
may
never
be
suspected
of
confounding
the
two
together
which
by
the
nature
of
the
ordinances
ought
to
be
kept
as
separate
and
distinct
as
possible
i
will
not
now
enter
more
fully
with
you
into
this
interesting
question
for
much
business
presses
upon
me
but
when
we
shall
happen
to
find
ourselves
more
at
leisure
my
dear
friend
which
i
trust
will
be
often
the
case
i
will
explain
to
you
in
a
manner
that
will
i
think
be
satisfactory
my
opinions
on
the
subject
meanwhile
dear
simpson
let
me
entreat
you
not
spoil
your
charming
eyes
by
weeping
nor
let
any
thing
lead
you
for
an
instant
to
doubt
that
my
sentiments
for
you
are
exactly
the
same
as
they
have
ever
been
and
above
all
cease
not
to
work
out
your
eternal
salvation
with
fear
and
trembling
cartwright
is
by
no
means
i
believe
a
very
person
and
i
think
it
probable
that
i
shall
often
feel
it
borne
in
upon
my
mind
that
by
applying
to
you
i
shall
be
able
to
forward
the
great
work
of
grace
that
i
have
in
hand
more
effectually
than
by
any
personal
assistance
that
she
is
likely
to
render
me
her
wealth
indeed
is
great
as
i
hope
some
little
keepsakes
from
me
may
prove
to
you
ere
long
but
as
to
energy
and
fervour
of
character
there
is
but
one
mrs
simpson
the
reverend
gentleman
here
saluted
the
fair
lady
lips
and
departed
leaving
her
exactly
in
the
state
he
wished
that
is
to
say
puzzled
confounded
mystified
and
not
knowing
the
least
in
the
world
what
she
should
say
to
him
next
chapter
iii
charles
interview
with
his
his
sudden
departure
from
wrexhill
there
were
moreover
other
ladies
to
be
encountered
most
of
whom
as
the
vicar
well
knew
would
not
hear
of
his
brilliant
nuptials
with
pleasure
but
this
was
a
matter
of
small
moment
the
benevolent
attentions
he
had
bestowed
upon
them
were
chiefly
for
the
purpose
of
ensuring
popularity
and
acquiring
influence
and
these
were
now
too
much
at
his
command
for
him
to
experience
the
slightest
anxiety
from
the
fear
of
losing
them
the
remembrance
of
the
three
misses
richards
was
indeed
rather
heavy
upon
him
especially
from
the
circumstance
of
miss
mary
having
accidentally
seen
him
kiss
miss
louisa
which
he
happened
to
do
in
the
little
shrubbery
behind
their
cottage
upon
occasion
of
a
serious
discourse
which
they
had
been
holding
together
upon
the
nature
and
influence
of
especial
grace
little
mary
who
was
purity
and
simplicity
personified
firmly
believed
in
her
very
innocent
heart
that
this
caress
could
only
be
given
by
such
a
gentleman
as
cartwright
as
the
ratification
of
a
treaty
of
marriage
and
had
accordingly
not
only
alluded
to
louisa
happy
prospects
herself
but
had
fully
persuaded
her
sister
charlotte
likewise
to
believe
that
this
blessed
union
would
be
the
result
of
the
vicar
soft
attentions
to
them
all
so
that
upon
a
smart
discussion
with
their
mother
upon
the
sin
of
works
when
matters
had
gone
so
far
as
to
induce
the
young
lady
to
declare
that
she
considered
the
door
of
her
mother
house
as
nothing
less
than
a
type
of
the
gates
of
hell
she
had
in
relating
the
scene
of
this
praiseworthy
combat
to
their
apostle
ventured
these
remarkable
words
there
is
sorrow
and
sin
in
dwelling
under
the
roof
of
the
scorner
but
when
dear
louisa
has
quite
consented
to
all
your
wishes
cartwright
her
bowels
will
yearn
towards
her
sisters
and
you
will
both
of
you
draw
us
out
of
the
way
of
temptation
under
the
shelter
and
the
shadow
of
your
wing
the
only
reply
which
the
vicar
made
to
this
speech
was
the
utterance
of
a
fervent
blessing
he
now
remembered
with
considerable
satisfaction
the
cautious
tendency
of
this
reply
and
upon
the
whole
thought
that
there
was
no
occasion
to
fatigue
his
spirits
by
making
these
young
ladies
a
private
visit
to
announce
his
change
of
condition
as
in
the
case
of
simpson
he
therefore
turned
from
the
widow
door
after
the
pause
of
a
moment
on
her
threshold
during
which
these
thoughts
were
rapidly
but
healthily
digested
leaving
him
that
is
to
say
neither
loaded
with
remorse
nor
fevered
by
anxiety
upon
this
occasion
for
some
reason
or
other
connected
perhaps
with
that
tranquillity
of
mind
in
his
lady
which
it
was
so
unquestionably
his
duty
to
guard
the
vicar
of
wrexhill
had
not
made
use
of
his
carriage
and
servants
he
walked
therefore
back
to
the
park
and
met
charles
mowbray
coming
through
the
lodge
gates
as
he
entered
them
the
young
man
touched
his
hat
and
was
walking
on
but
the
vicar
stopped
him
where
are
you
going
my
dear
charles
said
he
it
is
getting
quite
late
you
will
not
have
time
for
a
walk
before
dinner
it
is
almost
dark
you
know
my
habits
are
those
of
great
punctuality
i
shall
never
interfere
with
those
habits
sir
it
is
probable
that
i
may
not
return
to
dinner
indeed
we
shall
be
very
sorry
to
lose
you
where
are
you
going
then
my
dear
boy
charles
hesitated
his
heart
seemed
to
swell
in
his
bosom
at
this
questioning
and
though
in
fact
he
had
strolled
out
without
any
idea
of
absenting
himself
at
dinner
something
like
a
spirit
of
rebellion
induced
him
to
answer
to
sir
gilbert
harrington
sir
good
evening
then
let
me
bespeak
your
ear
for
half
an
hour
in
my
library
morning
between
the
hours
of
eleven
and
twelve
charles
bowed
but
uttered
not
a
word
and
proceeded
towards
oakley
inwardly
muttering
he
entered
the
mansion
of
his
old
friends
without
an
apology
but
stated
the
cause
of
his
visit
as
it
really
was
i
could
not
bear
to
be
examined
by
him
as
to
where
i
was
going
and
when
i
was
coming
and
rather
to
prove
my
independence
than
for
any
other
reason
i
am
come
to
you
can
you
forgive
this
ay
truly
can
we
replied
the
old
lady
and
be
sure
to
do
the
same
next
time
charles
it
makes
me
sick
to
think
of
this
species
of
paternal
admonishing
i
am
to
be
lectured
for
my
impatience
under
it
as
i
suspect
for
he
bade
me
meet
him
in
morning
his
library
scoundrel
exclaimed
sir
gilbert
through
his
closed
teeth
shall
i
obey
the
mandate
sir
gilbert
said
charles
or
shall
i
take
no
notice
of
it
the
question
seems
an
easy
one
to
answer
charles
replied
the
baronet
and
had
i
been
to
answer
yesterday
morning
i
should
have
said
without
hesitation
set
fire
to
the
library
and
stifle
him
in
it
like
a
weazel
as
he
is
rather
than
come
at
his
call
but
i
have
taken
it
into
my
head
since
that
our
test
game
will
be
to
keep
things
soft
and
smooth
for
a
while
so
wait
upon
him
master
charles
in
your
library
and
hear
all
he
has
got
to
say
and
do
turn
yourself
out
of
the
house
and
do
spit
upon
him
if
you
can
help
it
but
i
hope
he
wo
sit
in
poor
mowbray
chair
in
consequence
of
this
counsel
charles
did
wait
upon
the
vicar
in
his
father
library
at
the
appointed
hour
and
took
what
comfort
he
could
from
perceiving
that
he
was
not
seated
in
that
lamented
father
chair
but
had
ensconced
himself
in
a
fauteuil
of
surpassing
softness
which
he
had
caused
to
be
brought
from
the
for
his
especial
comfort
you
have
not
kept
me
waiting
and
i
commend
you
for
it
my
son
may
he
in
whom
i
trust
lead
you
in
his
own
good
time
to
be
all
that
your
pious
mother
can
wish
to
see
you
sit
down
charles
pray
sit
down
poor
charles
the
whole
scene
was
purgatory
to
him
but
his
courage
did
not
forsake
him
and
instead
of
running
out
of
the
room
as
he
felt
terribly
tempted
to
do
he
sat
down
opposite
to
his
stepfather
determined
to
hear
every
thing
he
had
to
say
i
think
charles
that
the
pious
nature
of
your
mother
awakened
as
it
has
of
late
been
must
by
this
time
be
so
sufficiently
known
to
you
all
as
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
your
mistaking
her
motives
for
marrying
the
second
father
in
whose
presence
you
are
now
placed
her
motives
have
been
of
the
holiest
kind
and
never
probably
did
any
person
perform
a
more
acceptable
service
than
she
did
when
placing
her
hand
within
mine
before
his
altar
she
resigned
that
power
over
her
children
which
maternal
weakness
rendered
almost
nugatory
to
one
who
is
too
strong
in
the
lord
to
permit
any
human
feelings
or
motives
ever
to
make
him
swerve
from
that
course
which
he
is
taught
to
believe
the
best
it
would
be
a
very
shining
pleasure
to
me
if
your
thankfulness
for
this
most
merciful
dispensation
were
at
this
very
moment
to
impel
you
to
kneel
down
on
one
of
these
cushions
of
such
there
are
always
sufficient
and
to
spare
in
the
dwellings
of
the
chosen
i
wish
i
say
that
even
now
i
could
see
you
fall
down
before
me
to
give
thanks
for
having
sent
to
you
and
to
your
sisters
one
of
his
own
as
your
guide
and
protector
through
the
pitfalls
of
this
life
and
to
usher
you
with
favour
into
his
presence
in
the
life
to
come
i
would
willingly
see
you
thus
grateful
for
manifest
mercies
but
i
shall
not
insist
upon
it
at
this
moment
for
i
know
charles
how
different
have
been
the
paths
in
which
your
teachers
have
hitherto
led
you
the
vicar
here
paused
but
as
there
was
no
point
in
his
harangue
to
which
mowbray
could
have
replied
in
the
spirit
which
his
friend
had
recommended
to
him
he
resolutely
kept
silence
the
time
will
come
resumed
the
vicar
the
time
come
when
your
knees
young
man
shall
be
less
stubborn
but
it
is
time
that
i
unfold
to
you
the
business
upon
which
i
wished
to
speak
when
i
permitted
your
attendance
in
this
apartment
you
have
been
led
doubtless
by
the
active
machinations
of
the
devil
to
turn
your
sinful
thoughts
towards
that
profession
which
beyond
all
others
has
made
satan
its
patron
and
its
saint
in
one
word
you
have
thought
of
going
into
the
army
and
it
is
to
inform
you
that
i
shall
not
permit
this
dreadful
sin
to
be
committed
by
one
of
my
family
that
you
are
now
before
me
open
not
your
mouth
young
man
in
defence
of
the
set
to
whom
you
would
wish
to
belong
my
ears
must
not
be
profaned
by
any
words
of
such
abhorrent
tendency
instead
of
speaking
yourself
hear
me
my
will
is
that
you
return
to
college
there
to
prepare
yourself
for
ordination
i
utter
this
command
with
a
conscience
void
of
offence
for
though
your
awful
deficiency
in
religion
is
well
known
to
me
i
have
confidence
in
the
lord
and
in
the
power
he
will
give
me
to
work
a
change
and
moreover
i
know
to
what
bishop
i
shall
lead
you
for
ordination
thereby
securing
to
myself
the
consolation
of
knowing
that
no
human
learning
will
enable
you
to
be
received
within
the
pale
that
we
are
strengthening
around
us
and
within
which
none
shall
be
admitted
if
we
can
help
it
but
the
regenerate
and
adopted
or
such
as
we
of
the
evangelical
church
may
choose
to
pledge
ourselves
shall
become
so
as
to
the
manner
and
amount
of
your
future
income
i
shall
take
the
arrangement
of
it
entirely
into
my
own
hands
reserving
to
myself
the
power
of
varying
your
allowance
from
time
to
time
as
shall
seem
good
you
may
have
a
few
days
holidays
here
if
you
wish
it
in
honour
of
your
mother
marriage
after
which
i
will
give
you
ten
pounds
for
your
journey
and
other
contingent
expenses
and
permit
you
to
employ
such
tradesmen
at
oxford
as
i
shall
point
out
for
such
necessaries
as
it
is
proper
i
should
furnish
you
with
their
bills
must
be
forwarded
to
corbold
who
for
the
present
i
shall
probably
continue
as
my
agent
and
when
i
have
duly
examined
them
they
shall
be
paid
your
college
expenses
i
shall
also
order
to
be
transmitted
to
him
and
through
him
to
i
must
now
dismiss
you
for
i
have
letters
to
be
careful
in
passing
these
windows
if
you
please
not
to
approach
them
too
closely
this
room
is
a
favourite
apartment
of
mine
and
i
must
not
be
interrupted
or
annoyed
in
it
in
any
way
remember
this
if
you
please
good
morning
during
the
whole
of
this
very
trying
interview
mowbray
had
not
uttered
a
single
word
he
knew
that
if
he
opened
his
lips
the
indignation
that
burned
at
his
heart
would
burst
forth
with
a
vehemence
he
should
no
longer
be
able
to
control
he
felt
his
heart
throb
and
every
pulse
so
fiercely
keeping
time
to
it
that
he
was
terrified
at
himself
and
fearful
lest
the
tide
of
passion
that
worked
thus
fearfully
within
him
should
drive
him
to
do
or
even
to
say
what
he
might
repent
he
hastened
from
the
room
leaving
cartwright
very
comfortably
persuaded
that
the
eloquence
which
had
been
bestowed
on
him
if
it
sometimes
failed
in
converting
those
who
heard
him
to
his
doctrine
was
of
a
nature
well
calculated
to
enforce
his
authority
a
species
of
success
which
perhaps
satisfied
him
better
still
the
unfortunate
charles
took
refuge
in
helen
dressing
room
from
the
storm
that
raged
in
his
bosom
he
longed
to
hear
the
gentle
voice
of
his
sister
with
as
much
eagerness
as
one
panting
in
fever
longs
for
a
cool
breeze
or
a
refreshing
stream
and
when
he
entered
the
room
and
found
it
unoccupied
he
felt
as
if
that
misfortune
were
greater
than
all
which
had
fallen
upon
him
before
in
a
state
of
the
most
pitiable
depression
of
spirits
he
seated
himself
most
forlornly
on
a
that
stood
in
a
recess
as
far
as
possible
from
the
windows
and
there
resting
his
head
on
the
side
of
it
and
covering
his
face
with
his
hands
he
remained
for
a
considerable
time
perfectly
immoveable
and
quite
as
miserable
as
his
worst
enemy
could
wish
at
length
the
door
opened
and
a
female
entered
charles
sprang
forward
to
meet
her
and
very
narrowly
escaped
encircling
miss
torrington
in
his
arms
she
drew
back
certainly
but
hardly
with
so
sudden
a
movement
as
that
of
mowbray
who
colouring
and
stammering
in
extreme
confusion
said
as
he
retreated
to
his
former
place
i
beg
your
pardon
i
came
here
to
look
for
helen
and
so
did
i
mowbray
i
can
not
think
where
she
has
hid
but
you
do
not
look
like
yourself
charles
has
cartwright
been
speaking
to
you
i
heard
him
tell
his
wife
that
he
had
desired
you
to
meet
him
in
the
library
in
his
library
miss
torrington
pray
call
it
as
he
does
library
but
what
a
fool
am
i
to
care
thus
for
a
word
it
is
his
library
the
man
says
right
but
what
then
is
poor
helen
what
is
fanny
what
am
i
his
features
expressed
such
terrible
agony
of
mind
that
rosalind
almost
felt
afraid
to
leave
him
and
stood
at
some
distance
from
him
as
he
sat
with
her
looks
riveted
upon
his
face
and
her
eyes
overflowing
with
tears
tell
me
dear
charles
she
said
what
is
it
that
has
happened
to
you
i
will
go
and
seek
helen
and
bring
her
to
you
in
a
moment
only
tell
me
before
i
go
if
any
new
thing
has
happened
to
make
us
all
more
miserable
than
we
were
is
it
not
common
cause
mowbray
for
heaven
sake
tell
me
what
has
befallen
you
it
is
not
common
cause
miss
torrington
he
replied
with
bitterness
my
situation
is
i
heartily
hope
without
a
parallel
and
as
none
can
share
my
wretchedness
as
none
can
relieve
it
it
were
better
i
believe
that
none
should
know
it
that
is
not
the
language
of
friendship
mowbray
were
poor
helen
here
i
trust
you
would
not
answer
her
inquiries
so
harshly
harshly
if
so
i
have
been
very
wrong
forgive
could
you
have
heard
the
language
this
man
held
to
me
could
you
have
seen
him
enthroned
in
my
poor
father
library
and
heard
him
tell
me
that
when
i
passed
before
the
windows
i
must
take
care
not
to
approach
too
nearly
oh
rosalind
could
you
have
heard
all
this
you
would
not
wonder
if
i
answered
even
madly
to
any
questions
asked
rosalind
stood
silently
before
him
when
he
had
ceased
to
speak
her
hands
tightly
clasped
and
her
eyes
riveted
on
the
ground
i
will
ask
you
but
one
question
more
said
she
after
a
long
pause
and
what
is
that
miss
torrington
torrington
said
she
muttering
between
her
teeth
alas
how
madly
have
i
acted
and
how
difficult
is
it
to
retrace
a
wrong
step
once
taken
she
trembled
violently
so
violently
that
she
was
obliged
to
support
herself
by
leaning
on
the
back
of
a
chair
which
stood
near
her
charles
mowbray
head
again
rested
on
the
sofa
and
his
eyes
were
hid
from
her
she
felt
that
he
saw
her
not
and
this
perhaps
it
was
which
gave
her
courage
to
proceed
in
the
task
she
had
determined
to
perform
but
her
breast
heaved
almost
convulsively
and
her
mouth
became
so
parched
that
it
was
with
difficulty
she
could
articulate
these
words
i
learn
from
sir
gilbert
harrington
mowbray
that
i
have
the
power
of
making
him
my
guardian
thank
heaven
exclaimed
charles
interrupting
her
i
thank
heaven
for
it
miss
you
may
then
escape
and
immediately
from
this
place
of
torment
this
will
indeed
help
me
to
bear
it
better
he
spoke
the
last
words
more
composedly
but
again
buried
his
face
on
the
sofa
but
think
you
mowbray
i
would
leave
helen
here
i
fear
you
will
have
no
power
to
take
her
he
replied
not
i
but
you
oh
mr
mowbray
charles
charles
will
you
not
understand
me
will
you
spare
me
this
agony
no
you
will
not
but
i
have
deserved
it
all
and
i
will
bear
it
charles
mowbray
it
is
i
who
would
now
lay
my
fortune
at
your
feet
oh
do
not
answer
me
as
i
once
answered
you
charles
mowbray
will
you
take
me
for
your
wife
no
by
heaven
he
exclaimed
falling
on
his
knees
before
her
poor
rosalind
dear
generous
devoted
friend
and
for
her
sake
then
for
my
dear
helen
sake
you
would
submit
to
be
my
wife
wife
an
outcast
penniless
insulted
beggar
no
rosalind
by
heaven
no
i
would
rather
perish
in
the
lowest
state
of
human
wretchedness
than
so
abuse
your
noble
nature
but
do
me
justice
noble
rosalind
let
there
on
one
point
at
least
be
some
equality
between
us
believe
that
i
love
you
and
that
with
a
strength
of
passion
of
which
as
i
think
your
unawakened
heart
has
yet
no
power
to
judge
but
should
you
rosalind
ever
learn
what
it
is
to
love
then
do
me
justice
and
know
how
dear
was
honour
to
my
soul
when
i
adored
but
could
refuse
you
he
seized
her
dress
and
pressed
it
to
his
lips
and
then
rising
from
his
knees
he
darted
out
of
the
room
without
daring
to
trust
his
eyes
to
look
at
her
had
mowbray
state
of
mind
been
somewhat
less
miserable
had
the
buoyant
spirit
given
to
him
by
nature
been
less
completely
crushed
by
the
galling
interview
of
the
morning
it
is
probable
that
his
memory
might
have
suggested
to
him
some
circumstances
in
the
hours
passed
heretofore
with
rosalind
which
might
have
raised
some
blessed
hope
upon
his
mind
as
to
the
motive
and
feelings
that
had
led
her
to
act
as
she
had
done
but
as
it
was
no
such
light
from
heaven
fell
upon
him
in
simplest
sincerity
he
believed
that
she
had
rejected
his
suit
because
she
did
not
love
him
and
that
she
had
now
offered
to
become
his
wife
solely
for
helen
sake
and
in
the
generous
hope
of
saving
her
by
giving
to
him
the
power
of
offering
her
a
home
with
this
conviction
he
determined
to
spare
her
the
embarrassment
and
himself
the
torture
of
meeting
again
with
all
the
feverish
hurry
of
impatient
suffering
he
instantly
sought
his
mother
informed
her
of
cartwright
wish
that
he
should
return
to
oxford
and
of
his
own
desire
to
comply
with
this
immediately
there
was
something
in
the
suddenness
of
this
unresisting
obedience
that
seemed
to
startle
her
she
applauded
his
resolution
but
seemed
to
wish
that
for
some
short
time
at
least
he
should
delay
the
execution
of
it
but
on
this
point
he
was
immoveable
and
as
cartwright
appeared
well
pleased
that
so
it
should
be
he
succeeded
in
so
hastening
the
arrangements
for
his
departure
that
within
hours
he
had
left
the
house
and
that
without
having
again
seen
rosalind
the
greater
part
of
this
interval
indeed
was
passed
at
oakley
where
his
reiterated
assurances
that
he
should
be
much
very
much
happier
at
oxford
than
at
home
were
accepted
in
excuse
for
the
suddenness
of
his
departure
sir
gilbert
indeed
had
so
well
read
rosalind
heart
and
so
confidently
did
he
anticipate
his
speedy
and
even
triumphant
return
that
both
himself
and
his
lady
who
as
usual
was
wholly
in
his
confidence
saw
him
depart
without
regret
and
uttered
their
farewells
with
a
cheerfulness
that
grated
sadly
on
the
feelings
of
the
poor
exile
chapter
iv
the
vicar
he
sets
about
making
some
important
reforms
in
the
village
the
departure
of
charles
so
immediate
and
so
unrepining
seemed
to
the
vicar
a
most
satisfactory
proof
that
the
talent
and
firmness
which
he
had
himself
displayed
in
their
final
interview
had
produced
exactly
the
effect
which
he
hoped
and
intended
he
will
i
think
trouble
me
no
more
such
was
the
comfortable
little
mental
soliloquy
with
which
as
he
sat
in
his
noble
library
the
vicar
of
wrexhill
listened
to
the
wheels
of
the
cab
lent
to
convey
mowbray
to
the
nearest
town
through
which
the
coach
passed
this
good
work
achieved
which
was
of
that
species
permitted
by
the
peculiar
doctrine
of
his
sect
cartwright
of
cartwright
park
began
to
look
around
him
among
his
neighbours
and
dependants
for
opportunities
of
displaying
both
his
sanctity
and
his
magnificence
every
thing
seemed
to
prosper
with
him
and
the
satisfaction
produced
by
this
success
was
very
greatly
enhanced
by
the
consciousness
that
he
owed
it
all
from
the
humble
courtesy
of
the
village
maidens
up
to
the
crowning
glory
of
his
lady
love
and
all
the
wealth
it
brought
wholly
and
solely
to
himself
ungrateful
would
he
have
been
for
such
unnumbered
blessings
had
he
neglected
to
reward
that
self
by
every
kind
observance
and
by
every
thoughtful
care
which
his
active
fancy
his
fastidious
taste
and
his
luxurious
nature
could
suggest
but
he
did
it
all
so
that
no
voice
was
raised
to
censure
the
dainty
appetite
of
the
priest
no
lip
was
curled
in
scorn
as
every
week
brought
forth
some
new
indulgence
some
exquisite
refinement
of
elaborate
luxury
every
thing
seemed
to
prosper
with
him
the
wines
he
ordered
could
hardly
be
accounted
dear
even
at
the
prices
he
gave
for
them
the
beautiful
creature
he
bought
for
his
own
riding
with
just
action
enough
to
show
off
his
handsome
figure
and
not
sufficient
to
occasion
him
the
least
fatigue
appeared
to
be
so
born
and
bred
on
purpose
for
his
use
that
every
eye
was
fixed
in
admiration
as
he
paced
along
and
no
tongue
wagged
to
tell
that
while
young
mowbray
departed
from
his
father
house
with
ten
pounds
in
his
pocket
his
stepfather
ambling
hack
cost
two
hundred
every
thing
seemed
to
prosper
with
him
simpson
instead
of
spoiling
her
fine
eyes
and
reducing
by
her
secession
his
fair
congregation
of
elected
saints
which
he
had
certainly
good
reason
to
fear
listened
to
his
doctrine
now
with
the
same
yielding
obedience
that
she
did
before
and
so
far
was
the
tongue
of
slander
from
finding
any
thing
amiss
in
the
frequent
pastoral
visits
he
continued
to
pay
her
that
her
credit
particularly
with
her
tradespeople
stood
higher
than
ever
and
her
and
her
and
her
albums
flourished
quite
as
well
as
when
she
believed
that
she
and
they
would
ere
long
be
translated
to
the
vicarage
of
richards
converted
daughters
little
mary
was
the
only
one
who
ventured
openly
to
declare
that
she
thought
the
vicar
had
behaved
extremely
ill
that
after
what
she
saw
pass
between
him
and
sister
louisa
it
was
a
sin
not
to
marry
her
and
that
she
did
not
think
poor
mowbray
would
ever
be
happy
with
a
man
who
was
so
very
much
in
love
with
another
person
but
it
was
only
little
mary
who
said
all
this
and
nobody
paid
much
attention
to
it
the
pious
louisa
herself
declared
indeed
that
there
never
had
been
any
thing
but
the
purest
evangelical
love
between
them
and
that
the
kiss
about
which
silly
mary
made
such
a
fuss
was
nothing
in
the
world
but
a
kiss
of
holy
peace
and
brotherly
love
the
same
eloquence
which
persuaded
the
young
lady
so
to
think
or
at
any
rate
so
to
say
persuaded
her
likewise
and
her
sister
charlotte
with
her
to
persevere
in
their
avocations
they
continued
to
compose
tracts
to
get
them
printed
and
sold
when
they
could
and
to
read
them
aloud
and
give
them
away
in
manuscript
when
they
could
not
they
also
continued
most
perseveringly
to
expound
both
tracts
and
scriptures
for
the
edification
of
their
very
unhappy
mother
who
having
passed
the
last
twenty
years
of
her
life
in
exerting
every
faculty
to
render
them
happy
around
her
could
not
now
so
change
her
plan
as
to
give
them
that
portion
of
her
house
for
the
display
of
their
inspired
eloquence
which
she
herself
did
not
occupy
and
thus
she
passed
by
far
the
greater
portion
of
every
day
in
listening
to
their
ceaseless
assurances
that
the
pit
of
hell
was
yawning
to
receive
her
major
dalrymple
being
present
on
one
occasion
when
this
was
going
on
with
peculiar
fervour
waited
very
patiently
till
there
was
a
pause
in
the
eloquence
of
miss
charlotte
who
was
holding
forth
and
then
said
scotchly
and
quietly
well
well
i
see
not
but
it
is
all
very
fair
between
you
and
your
mother
my
bonny
lasses
she
has
been
always
forgetting
herself
for
your
sakes
and
you
are
now
forgetting
yourselves
for
hers
it
was
not
very
long
however
after
the
marriage
of
the
vicar
that
a
welcome
and
ray
of
hope
once
more
gleamed
upon
her
it
rose
from
the
fair
forehead
of
little
mary
from
the
time
of
her
conversion
all
her
very
pretty
curls
had
been
straightened
and
pushed
behind
her
ears
and
the
little
straw
bonnet
which
covered
them
was
the
rival
or
rather
the
model
of
fanny
mowbray
but
by
degrees
a
few
of
these
curls
began
to
reappear
round
her
face
her
ribbons
were
exchanged
for
the
bright
tints
that
suited
so
well
with
her
clear
brown
skin
her
laughing
eyes
began
to
recover
their
brightness
and
at
last
she
whispered
in
her
mother
ear
forgive
me
dearest
mamma
for
all
my
folly
my
presumption
forgive
me
dearest
mother
and
pray
god
to
forgive
me
too
from
that
moment
richards
felt
restored
to
happiness
she
had
too
early
learnt
that
at
the
best
life
is
but
like
a
changeable
web
of
silk
in
which
the
dark
tints
predominate
to
poison
the
enjoyment
which
mary
return
to
reason
brought
her
by
remembering
at
any
moment
when
it
was
possible
to
forget
it
that
she
had
still
two
daughters
who
declared
their
persuasion
that
they
could
never
meet
her
in
the
life
to
come
she
wisely
and
with
true
piety
turned
all
her
thoughts
to
mary
soothed
her
remorse
and
reconciled
her
to
herself
in
addition
to
this
great
joy
she
thought
she
saw
the
promise
of
another
that
for
years
had
formed
her
favourite
castle
in
the
air
she
thought
she
saw
that
major
dalrymple
looked
at
the
recovered
mary
with
eyes
expressive
of
love
as
well
as
of
joy
and
with
this
hope
before
her
and
the
delightful
occupation
of
watching
mary
sometimes
blush
and
always
smile
when
the
major
entered
her
life
once
more
ceased
to
be
a
burden
and
rosalind
again
found
that
she
sang
the
very
sweetest
second
in
the
world
as
soon
as
the
occupation
of
receiving
and
returning
the
wedding
visits
was
pretty
well
over
cartwright
set
about
making
some
important
alterations
and
reforms
in
the
village
of
wrexhill
his
attentive
wife
suggested
to
him
that
he
would
find
the
fatigues
of
a
large
landed
proprietor
who
so
actively
inquired
into
every
thing
as
he
did
too
much
for
his
health
and
spirits
if
he
continued
vicar
of
wrexhill
but
to
this
he
answered
heaven
forbid
my
lovely
clara
that
i
should
ever
suffer
my
cares
for
my
earthly
possessions
to
interfere
with
those
especially
relating
to
my
heavenly
ones
the
cure
of
souls
my
love
has
ever
been
a
favourite
occupation
with
me
it
greatly
assists
in
giving
one
that
sort
of
influence
over
the
minds
of
ones
which
every
wise
and
holy
man
would
wish
to
possess
but
i
have
already
secured
the
services
of
a
very
serious
and
exemplary
curate
my
dear
love
who
will
relieve
me
from
that
part
of
the
duty
which
as
you
justly
fear
might
prove
injurious
to
my
health
this
arrangement
will
i
trust
answer
all
your
wishes
for
the
present
sweet
love
and
in
future
i
intend
that
our
son
charles
shall
be
my
curate
he
will
i
have
no
doubt
like
the
vicarage
as
a
residence
it
is
really
very
pretty
and
sufficiently
near
us
to
permit
of
easy
and
i
should
hope
frequent
intercourse
but
it
must
be
a
year
or
two
before
this
can
be
put
in
practice
and
in
the
mean
time
i
trust
that
we
shall
find
samuel
hetherington
a
pious
and
prayerful
young
man
i
am
not
without
hopes
that
he
will
arrive
at
the
vicarage
i
forget
dear
if
i
mentioned
to
you
any
thing
about
him
i
certainly
as
you
observe
am
very
much
occupied
however
do
let
me
forget
to
say
that
if
he
comes
he
must
be
invited
to
dine
here
another
of
cartwright
new
arrangements
arose
from
a
scene
that
passed
between
marsh
the
quiet
peaceable
village
schoolmaster
and
himself
this
poor
man
who
had
a
wife
and
some
children
contrived
to
maintain
them
all
by
keeping
school
he
had
a
good
house
and
extensive
which
tempted
many
a
tradesman
in
the
county
town
and
some
even
in
london
to
send
their
sons
to
wrexhill
to
improve
at
once
their
lungs
and
their
learning
he
had
also
a
considerable
number
of
from
all
the
farmers
round
besides
many
of
the
most
decent
and
of
the
village
children
as
to
keep
up
this
flourishing
concern
certainly
took
up
every
hour
of
marsh
waking
existence
and
weary
enough
was
he
at
night
poor
man
when
he
laid
his
head
on
his
pillow
but
no
one
had
ever
heard
him
complain
his
wife
and
children
were
comfortably
clothed
fed
and
lodged
his
were
all
well
contented
with
the
learning
and
the
health
of
their
children
and
all
his
neighbours
esteemed
and
spoke
well
of
him
before
cartwright
had
been
many
weeks
at
wrexhill
he
took
an
opportunity
of
making
a
very
kind
and
condescending
call
upon
the
worthy
schoolmaster
marsh
happened
at
that
moment
to
be
superintending
the
afternoon
but
he
instantly
obeyed
the
summons
and
received
the
vicar
in
his
best
parlour
with
every
demonstration
of
reverence
you
have
good
premises
here
marsh
said
the
clergyman
of
the
parish
really
a
very
decent
and
domain
how
many
boys
have
you
sir
boarders
twelve
and
sixteen
indeed
that
makes
a
considerable
number
of
christian
souls
and
what
sir
may
be
the
method
and
the
principle
of
your
religious
instruction
i
take
all
my
boarders
sir
to
church
twice
every
sunday
and
they
read
from
the
bible
twice
a
week
in
addition
to
which
we
have
family
prayer
night
and
morning
then
it
is
as
i
feared
marsh
replied
the
vicar
you
altogether
neglect
both
for
your
pupils
and
yourself
sir
my
nine
sabbath
evening
lecture
in
the
church
together
with
the
tuesday
expounding
and
the
thursday
evening
church
lecture
this
is
awful
negligence
sir
it
is
a
terrible
tempting
of
the
lord
i
think
cartwright
replied
the
poor
schoolmaster
colouring
that
i
shall
be
able
to
explain
to
your
satisfaction
my
reasons
for
not
attending
your
evening
lectures
some
of
my
boys
sir
are
almost
lads
i
have
two
hard
upon
seventeen
and
i
need
not
tell
a
gentleman
like
you
that
there
is
a
deal
of
caution
necessary
at
that
age
to
keep
lads
out
of
harm
way
i
have
had
the
character
of
sending
home
very
good
sober
decent
lads
and
this
i
think
has
done
me
more
service
in
getting
scholars
than
even
my
writing
and
but
perhaps
you
do
know
sir
and
i
am
sure
i
do
wish
to
put
myself
forward
to
tell
you
but
the
truth
is
cartwright
that
these
late
meetings
which
break
up
quite
in
the
dark
do
bring
together
a
great
many
disorderly
people
is
an
excuse
sir
for
every
boy
and
girl
that
is
in
service
to
get
out
just
when
they
ought
to
be
at
home
and
altogether
it
is
not
quite
the
sort
of
thing
i
approve
for
my
boys
but
when
i
tell
you
marsh
replied
the
vicar
with
much
dignity
that
it
is
the
sort
of
thing
which
i
approve
for
all
the
girls
and
boys
too
who
live
under
my
ministry
i
presume
that
you
do
not
intend
to
persevere
in
your
very
futile
and
i
must
call
it
impious
objection
if
you
sir
paid
the
attention
that
you
ought
to
do
to
the
religious
object
of
the
meeting
your
impure
imagination
would
not
be
quite
so
busy
about
its
moral
consequences
i
am
sorry
to
tell
you
marsh
that
you
are
splitting
on
the
rock
which
sends
more
wrecked
and
wretched
souls
to
hell
than
any
other
peril
of
this
mortal
life
let
it
be
what
it
may
well
sir
replied
the
schoolmaster
mildly
i
must
make
up
my
account
between
god
and
my
own
conscience
and
trust
to
his
mercy
to
overlook
my
deficiencies
overlook
your
deficiencies
poor
deluded
man
do
you
really
hope
that
the
lord
will
pardon
the
clinging
to
works
and
neglecting
to
hear
his
word
do
you
really
doubt
that
satan
stands
ready
at
the
door
to
seize
your
soul
and
bear
it
in
his
poisoned
claws
to
everlasting
torture
do
you
really
doubt
this
mr
marsh
indeed
i
do
sir
this
is
terrible
cried
the
vicar
starting
up
and
attempting
to
stop
his
ears
such
blasphemy
can
not
be
listened
to
without
sin
i
leave
you
sir
and
i
will
shake
the
dust
off
this
your
carpet
from
off
my
feet
but
remember
this
i
am
your
pastor
and
master
appointed
to
be
the
minister
and
guide
of
all
the
souls
in
my
parish
as
for
your
soul
i
have
no
hope
left
for
it
it
must
and
it
will
have
its
portion
among
the
condemned
and
will
exist
only
to
burn
in
unspeakable
tortures
for
i
have
spoken
and
you
know
your
doom
but
not
so
is
it
with
the
young
persons
committed
to
your
charge
though
alas
the
peril
in
which
they
now
abide
is
sore
to
think
of
nevertheless
i
will
neither
leave
them
nor
forsake
them
as
long
as
hope
is
left
that
a
single
brand
can
be
snatched
from
the
burning
wherefore
hear
me
this
day
is
thursday
let
me
this
night
see
yourself
and
every
boy
abiding
in
your
house
in
the
gallery
which
you
occupy
in
the
church
or
i
will
set
to
work
to
weed
the
vineyard
yea
i
will
cleanse
it
root
and
branch
from
the
corruption
and
abomination
of
you
and
your
boys
poor
wretches
that
you
are
labouring
and
striving
to
prepare
for
the
kingdom
of
hell
but
i
speak
sinfully
in
joining
you
and
them
together
and
may
the
lord
forgive
me
as
i
will
strive
to
atone
for
it
i
will
clear
the
vineyard
of
you
but
not
till
i
have
separated
your
boys
from
you
they
shall
be
saved
by
my
hand
shall
they
be
saved
and
when
i
shall
have
effected
this
you
may
perchance
while
enjoying
the
leisure
that
will
be
your
portion
remember
this
day
and
value
at
its
worth
the
wisdom
which
made
you
brave
a
minister
of
the
evangelical
church
have
i
softened
your
hard
heart
marsh
will
you
bring
your
school
to
my
lecture
this
evening
say
and
you
are
forgiven
no
sir
i
will
not
was
the
quiet
but
firm
reply
of
the
good
man
not
another
syllable
was
spoken
on
either
side
but
well
did
the
vicar
of
wrexhill
keep
his
word
public
estimation
and
private
appeared
for
a
time
to
resist
all
the
efforts
he
could
make
to
persuade
the
villagers
and
the
farmers
round
about
that
marsh
was
a
very
impious
and
dangerous
man
and
one
whom
it
was
dangerous
to
trust
with
their
children
they
knew
better
they
knew
that
he
was
honest
intelligent
patient
and
strictly
attentive
to
his
religious
duties
but
constant
dropping
will
wear
away
a
stone
and
constant
malevolence
kept
in
constant
action
by
one
who
was
not
very
scrupulous
as
to
the
truth
or
falsehood
of
any
statement
that
tended
to
produce
the
effect
he
wished
at
length
began
like
rust
upon
steel
to
cover
and
hide
its
true
colour
and
its
real
brightness
one
by
one
his
daily
scholars
fell
away
from
him
one
by
one
the
neighbouring
farmers
came
with
some
civil
reason
for
not
finding
the
sending
their
boys
so
likely
to
answer
as
formerly
and
one
by
one
his
distant
patrons
found
out
the
same
thing
so
that
soon
after
the
vicar
marriage
he
had
the
great
delight
of
hearing
that
marsh
was
sent
to
prison
because
he
could
not
pay
his
rent
that
his
furniture
was
seized
for
taxes
and
his
tidy
little
wife
lying
ill
of
a
brain
fever
at
a
small
near
the
prison
with
her
children
starving
round
her
the
sort
of
inward
chuckle
with
which
the
prosperous
vicar
received
this
bit
of
village
gossip
from
his
valet
has
no
letters
by
which
it
can
be
spelt
it
was
the
hosannah
of
a
fiend
the
supplying
marsh
place
in
wrexhill
was
one
of
the
things
that
now
demanded
cartwright
immediate
attention
and
notwithstanding
the
many
delicious
temptations
to
idleness
which
surrounded
him
his
love
of
power
stronger
even
than
his
love
of
luxury
led
him
to
hunt
for
and
to
find
an
individual
to
fill
the
situation
whose
perfect
obedience
to
his
will
made
the
dominion
of
the
village
school
worth
counting
among
the
gratifying
rights
and
immunities
of
his
enviable
position
many
of
the
country
families
partly
from
curiosity
and
partly
from
respect
for
the
owner
of
the
park
let
him
be
who
he
would
paid
their
visits
and
sent
their
invitations
with
an
appearance
of
consideration
very
dear
to
his
heart
particularly
when
it
chanced
that
this
consideration
proceeded
from
persons
blessed
by
bearing
a
title
as
to
his
domestic
circle
it
went
on
rather
better
than
he
expected
if
not
a
happy
it
was
a
very
quiet
one
helen
drooped
it
is
true
and
looked
wofully
pale
but
she
seldom
complained
at
all
and
if
she
did
he
heard
her
not
rosalind
was
very
wretched
but
a
host
of
womanly
feelings
were
at
work
within
her
to
prevent
its
being
guessed
by
any
even
helen
thought
that
she
had
a
wondrous
portion
of
philosophy
so
speedily
to
forget
poor
charles
and
so
very
soon
to
reconcile
herself
to
the
hateful
dominion
of
the
usurper
who
had
seized
his
place
but
helen
knew
not
how
she
passed
the
hours
when
no
eye
saw
and
no
ear
heard
her
neither
did
helen
know
the
terrible
effort
she
had
made
to
redeem
the
folly
and
the
pride
shown
in
her
answer
to
charles
the
first
and
only
time
that
he
had
ever
ventured
to
disclose
his
love
had
helen
known
this
and
the
manner
in
which
this
offer
of
herself
had
been
refused
she
would
have
loved
and
not
blamed
the
resolution
with
which
the
rosalind
hid
her
wound
from
every
eye
fanny
was
gloomy
silent
and
abstracted
but
cartwright
only
thought
that
the
poor
girl
having
been
passionately
in
love
with
him
was
suffering
a
few
natural
pangs
while
teaching
herself
to
consider
him
as
her
father
but
all
this
was
so
natural
so
inevitable
indeed
that
he
permitted
it
not
to
trouble
him
and
in
truth
he
was
so
accustomed
in
the
course
of
his
ministry
to
win
young
ladies
and
sometimes
old
ones
too
from
the
ordinary
ways
of
this
wicked
world
to
his
own
particular
path
of
righteousness
by
means
of
a
little
propitiatory
that
the
moans
and
groans
which
usually
terminated
this
part
of
the
process
towards
perfect
holiness
among
the
ladies
had
become
to
him
a
matter
of
great
indifference
notwithstanding
his
long
practice
in
the
study
of
the
female
heart
however
he
did
not
quite
interpret
that
of
fanny
mowbray
rightly
he
knew
nothing
of
the
depth
and
reality
of
fanatic
enthusiasm
into
which
he
had
plunged
her
young
mind
nor
could
he
guess
how
that
pure
but
now
fettered
spirit
would
labour
and
struggle
to
reach
some
of
assurance
on
which
to
rest
itself
and
thence
offer
its
unmixed
adoration
to
the
throne
of
grace
he
had
no
idea
how
constantly
fanny
was
thinking
of
heaven
when
he
was
talking
of
it
of
henrietta
he
never
thought
much
she
had
given
him
some
trouble
and
he
had
used
somewhat
violent
measures
to
bring
her
into
such
outward
training
as
might
not
violently
shock
his
adherents
and
disciples
but
all
this
was
now
settled
much
to
his
satisfaction
she
combed
her
hair
quite
straight
never
wore
pink
ribands
and
sat
in
church
exactly
as
many
hours
as
he
commanded
jacob
was
as
usual
his
joy
and
his
pride
and
nothing
he
could
do
or
say
sufficed
to
raise
a
doubt
in
the
mind
of
his
admiring
father
of
his
being
the
most
talented
young
man
in
europe
that
jacob
was
not
yet
quite
a
saint
he
was
ready
to
allow
but
so
prodigiously
brilliant
an
intellect
could
not
be
expected
to
fold
its
wings
and
settle
itself
at
once
in
the
temperate
beatitude
of
saintship
he
would
come
to
it
in
time
it
offered
such
inestimable
advantages
both
in
this
world
and
the
next
that
jacob
who
had
even
now
no
objection
to
an
easy
chair
would
be
sure
to
discover
the
advantages
of
the
calling
the
wife
of
his
bosom
was
really
every
thing
he
could
wish
a
wife
to
be
she
seemed
to
forget
that
there
could
be
any
other
use
for
her
ample
revenue
than
that
of
ministering
to
his
convenience
and
so
complete
was
the
devotion
with
which
she
seemed
to
lay
herself
and
all
that
was
hers
at
his
feet
that
no
shadowy
doubts
or
fears
tormented
him
respecting
that
now
first
object
of
his
life
the
making
her
will
but
though
thus
assured
of
becoming
her
heir
whenever
it
should
please
heaven
to
recall
her
he
took
care
to
omit
nothing
to
render
assurance
doubly
sure
not
a
caress
not
a
look
not
a
tender
word
but
had
this
for
its
object
and
when
his
dearest
life
repaid
him
with
a
smile
and
his
loveliest
clara
rewarded
him
with
a
kiss
he
saw
in
his
mind
eye
visions
of
exquisite
engrossings
forming
themselves
day
by
day
more
clearly
into
all
my
estates
real
and
personal
to
my
beloved
husband
thus
beyond
contradiction
every
thing
seemed
to
prosper
with
him
and
few
perhaps
of
those
who
gratified
his
vanity
by
becoming
his
guests
guessed
how
many
aching
hearts
sat
around
his
daily
banquet
chapter
the
vicar
at
home
spring
succeeded
to
winter
and
summer
to
spring
without
producing
any
important
change
at
cartwright
park
charles
mowbray
requested
and
obtained
permission
to
continue
his
studies
without
interruption
and
for
five
months
helen
and
rosalind
lived
upon
his
letters
which
spite
of
all
his
efforts
to
prevent
it
showed
a
spirit
so
utterly
depressed
as
to
render
them
both
miserable
they
seemed
both
of
them
to
be
converted
into
parts
of
that
stately
and
sumptuous
machine
which
cartwright
had
constructed
around
him
and
of
which
he
was
himself
the
main
spring
the
number
of
servants
was
greatly
increased
the
equipages
were
much
more
splendid
and
from
an
establishment
remarkably
simple
and
unostentatious
for
the
income
of
its
owners
the
park
became
one
of
the
most
magnificent
in
the
country
among
the
periodical
hospitalities
with
which
the
vicar
for
cartwright
was
still
vicar
of
wrexhill
among
his
periodical
hospitalities
was
a
weekly
morning
party
which
opened
by
prayers
read
by
his
curate
and
ended
by
a
blessing
pronounced
by
himself
at
about
two
a
déjeûner
à
la
fourchette
was
laid
in
the
around
which
were
discussed
all
the
serious
and
and
subjects
of
the
day
on
this
occasion
the
selection
of
company
though
always
pious
was
not
so
aristocratical
as
at
the
pompous
dinners
occasionally
given
at
the
park
but
what
was
lost
to
vanity
on
one
side
by
the
unconspicuous
rank
of
some
of
the
guests
was
gained
to
it
on
the
other
by
the
profound
veneration
for
their
host
expressed
in
every
word
and
in
every
look
not
only
corbold
the
lawyer
who
was
indeed
in
some
sort
ennobled
by
his
relationship
to
the
great
man
himself
but
the
new
curate
and
the
new
apothecary
and
even
the
new
schoolmaster
were
admitted
the
company
were
always
received
by
cartwright
and
his
lady
in
the
where
all
the
family
were
expected
that
is
commanded
on
pain
of
very
heavy
displeasure
to
assemble
round
them
the
tables
were
covered
with
bibles
tracts
evangelical
magazines
sanctified
drawings
and
missionary
begging
machines
hardly
could
chivers
who
was
become
an
example
to
all
serious
butlers
in
voice
in
look
and
in
step
produce
a
more
delightful
sensation
on
his
master
organs
by
announcing
my
lord
this
or
my
lady
that
than
that
master
received
from
watching
the
reverential
bows
of
the
sycophants
who
hung
upon
his
patronage
a
sort
of
frozen
blandishment
on
these
occasions
smoothed
his
proud
face
as
he
stood
with
his
lady
beside
him
to
receive
them
the
tall
obsequious
curate
who
hardly
dared
to
say
his
soul
was
his
own
though
he
freely
took
upon
himself
to
pronounce
the
destiny
of
other
people
bent
before
him
lower
than
mortal
ever
need
bend
to
mortal
and
he
was
rewarded
for
it
by
being
permitted
to
aspire
to
the
hand
of
the
only
daughter
of
cartwright
of
cartwright
park
the
little
round
apothecary
who
by
evangelical
aid
withal
had
pushed
out
his
predecessor
as
effectually
as
ever
pellet
did
pellet
in
a
popgun
sighed
whined
bought
tracts
expounded
them
kneeled
down
though
almost
too
fat
to
get
up
again
and
would
have
done
aught
else
that
to
a
canting
doctor
art
belongs
so
that
it
were
not
physically
impossible
for
one
sole
object
which
for
some
months
past
had
hardly
quitted
his
thoughts
by
day
or
by
night
this
lofty
object
of
ambition
and
of
hope
was
the
attending
the
lady
of
cartwright
of
cartwright
park
at
her
approaching
accouchement
the
new
schoolmaster
who
was
already
making
hundreds
where
his
unprofessing
predecessor
made
tens
of
pounds
was
a
huge
gaunt
man
who
had
already
buried
three
wives
and
who
had
besides
as
he
hoped
and
believed
the
advantage
of
being
childless
for
he
had
always
made
it
a
custom
to
quarrel
early
with
his
sons
and
daughters
and
send
them
to
seek
their
fortune
where
they
could
find
it
this
prosperous
gentleman
actually
and
bonâ
fide
fell
in
love
with
miss
torrington
and
having
very
tolerably
good
reasons
for
believing
that
there
were
few
things
at
cartwright
park
which
might
not
be
won
by
slavish
obedience
and
canting
hypocrisy
he
failed
not
to
divide
the
hours
during
which
he
was
weekly
permitted
an
entrée
there
between
ogling
the
young
lady
and
worshipping
the
master
of
the
mansion
poor
rosalind
had
found
means
after
her
dreadful
scene
with
mowbray
secretly
to
convey
a
note
to
sir
gilbert
informing
him
that
she
no
longer
wished
to
change
her
guardian
as
her
doing
so
would
not
she
feared
enable
her
to
free
helen
from
her
thraldom
she
was
still
therefore
cartwright
ward
and
the
vicar
had
not
yet
quite
abandoned
the
hope
that
his
talented
son
might
obtain
her
and
her
fortune
but
hitherto
jacob
had
declined
making
proposals
avowing
that
he
did
not
think
he
was
sufficiently
advanced
in
the
fair
good
graces
to
be
quite
sure
of
success
so
as
no
avowed
claim
had
been
hitherto
made
to
her
hand
the
schoolmaster
went
on
ogling
every
wednesday
morning
and
dreaming
every
wednesday
night
unchecked
by
any
for
the
fair
object
of
his
passion
was
perfectly
unconscious
of
having
inspired
it
simpson
of
course
never
failed
to
embellish
these
morning
meetings
with
her
presence
when
she
happened
to
be
in
the
country
but
she
had
lately
left
it
for
the
purpose
as
it
was
understood
of
making
a
visit
of
a
month
or
two
to
a
distant
friend
during
which
she
had
intended
to
place
her
charming
little
mimima
at
a
in
a
neighbouring
town
but
cartwright
so
greatly
admired
that
sweet
child
early
piety
that
he
recommended
his
lady
to
invite
her
to
pass
the
period
of
her
mamma
absence
at
cartwright
park
then
there
were
the
richards
family
who
for
various
reasons
were
among
the
most
constant
wednesday
visitors
richards
came
to
see
rosalind
little
mary
to
whisper
good
counsel
to
her
friend
fanny
and
the
two
elder
sisters
to
meet
all
the
serious
young
men
that
the
pompous
vicar
could
collect
round
him
from
every
village
or
town
in
the
vicinity
besides
these
there
were
many
others
too
numerous
indeed
to
be
permitted
a
place
in
these
pages
who
came
from
far
and
near
to
pray
and
to
gossip
to
eat
and
to
drink
at
cartwright
park
it
happened
at
one
of
these
meetings
about
the
middle
of
the
month
of
june
when
the
beauty
of
the
weather
had
brought
together
rather
a
larger
party
than
usual
that
a
subject
of
great
interest
to
the
majority
of
the
company
was
brought
under
discussion
by
cartwright
no
sooner
had
samuel
hetherington
his
curate
finished
his
prayer
and
such
of
the
company
risen
from
their
knees
as
chose
to
come
early
enough
to
take
part
in
that
portion
of
the
morning
arrangements
than
the
vicar
opened
the
subject
my
dear
friends
and
neighbours
he
said
i
have
to
communicate
what
i
am
sure
will
give
you
all
pleasure
for
are
we
not
a
society
united
in
the
lord
notwithstanding
the
little
differences
of
station
that
may
perhaps
exist
among
us
have
we
not
all
one
common
object
in
view
it
is
for
the
furtherance
of
this
divine
object
that
i
have
now
to
mention
to
you
a
circumstance
at
which
my
soul
and
the
soul
of
cartwright
rejoice
and
at
which
i
am
fully
persuaded
that
your
souls
will
rejoice
likewise
this
preface
produced
a
movement
of
lively
interest
throughout
the
whole
room
and
there
was
hardly
a
person
present
who
did
not
eagerly
undertake
to
answer
for
the
sympathy
of
his
or
her
soul
with
those
of
the
vicar
and
his
lady
since
we
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
last
resumed
the
vicar
i
have
received
a
despatch
from
the
secretary
of
the
south
central
african
bible
association
by
which
i
learn
that
it
is
in
contemplation
to
send
out
to
fababo
a
remarkably
serious
young
jew
recently
converted
as
missionary
and
minister
plenipotentiary
in
all
spiritual
affairs
relative
to
the
church
about
to
be
established
for
fababo
and
its
dependencies
but
as
you
all
well
know
that
such
a
glorious
enterprise
as
this
can
not
be
undertaken
without
funding
and
it
has
been
requested
of
me
in
the
despatch
to
which
i
have
alluded
that
i
should
exert
such
little
influence
as
i
have
among
you
my
dear
friends
and
neighbours
for
the
collecting
a
sum
in
aid
of
it
our
good
simpson
sweet
little
cherub
mimima
is
furnished
with
a
box
which
she
will
carry
round
as
soon
as
the
collation
is
ended
to
petition
your
generous
contributions
a
murmur
of
approbation
admiration
and
almost
of
adoration
burst
from
the
whole
company
and
the
conversation
immediately
turned
upon
the
conversion
of
jews
and
the
happiness
of
having
found
so
very
desirable
a
mission
for
isaacs
while
the
enthusiasm
was
at
its
height
cartwright
having
previously
received
a
hint
from
her
husband
proposed
that
a
serious
should
be
held
on
that
day
month
on
the
lawn
before
the
windows
of
cartwright
park
for
assisting
the
outfit
of
isaacs
if
all
the
ladies
present
continued
cartwright
and
such
of
their
friends
as
they
can
prevail
upon
to
join
them
will
only
occupy
themselves
during
the
ensuing
month
in
the
making
of
pincushions
the
composition
of
tracts
the
sketching
some
dozens
of
apostles
heads
together
with
a
few
thousand
allumettes
and
we
should
i
have
no
doubt
collect
a
sum
not
only
very
serviceable
to
the
exemplary
isaacs
but
highly
honourable
to
ourselves
delightful
cried
several
ladies
at
once
there
is
nothing
said
the
little
girlish
wife
of
a
neighbouring
curate
that
i
dote
upon
like
a
a
serious
of
course
i
mean
my
dear
she
added
colouring
as
she
caught
the
eye
of
her
alarmed
young
husband
fixed
upon
her
a
serious
for
an
object
observed
cartwright
is
indeed
a
charming
spectacle
if
the
lord
favours
us
by
granting
a
fine
day
the
whole
of
the
ceremonies
i
mean
including
the
opening
prayers
the
exposition
of
some
chapters
bearing
upon
the
subject
the
reading
a
tract
which
i
will
direct
my
curate
to
compose
for
the
occasion
and
the
final
blessing
all
this
i
think
if
the
weather
prove
favourable
should
be
performed
out
of
doors
as
well
as
the
sale
of
the
ladies
works
this
i
question
not
will
produce
a
very
imposing
effect
and
will
i
think
be
likely
to
bring
many
persons
who
by
a
blessing
upon
our
labours
may
be
induced
to
purchase
the
elderly
ladies
will
of
course
sell
the
articles
and
the
younger
ones
whose
piety
will
lead
them
to
attend
may
conceal
themselves
as
much
as
possible
from
the
public
eye
by
walking
about
in
my
groves
and
shrubberies
which
shall
be
open
for
the
occasion
it
will
be
desirable
i
imagine
to
get
handbills
printed
to
invite
the
attendance
of
the
whole
neighbourhood
do
you
not
think
this
will
be
advisable
i
am
sure
that
no
one
can
avoid
every
thing
like
general
display
and
ostentation
more
cautiously
than
i
do
but
i
conceive
this
public
announcement
on
the
present
occasion
absolutely
necessary
to
the
profitable
success
of
our
endeavours
absolutely
was
the
word
caught
by
echo
for
the
reply
have
the
goodness
hetherington
to
sit
down
at
that
small
table
you
will
there
find
all
things
needful
for
writing
and
indite
the
handbill
that
will
be
necessary
for
us
there
is
a
warmth
of
feeling
at
this
blessed
moment
generated
among
us
towards
this
holy
work
which
it
would
be
sin
to
neglect
let
it
not
like
those
good
feelings
and
resolutions
of
which
we
have
been
told
by
the
preacher
pass
away
from
us
to
pave
the
courts
of
hell
and
be
trodden
under
the
feet
of
the
scorners
who
inhabit
there
no
my
brethren
let
it
rather
rise
like
a
sweet
savour
of
incense
to
tell
that
not
in
vain
do
we
pronounce
his
name
on
earth
before
these
words
were
all
spoken
the
assiduous
curate
was
already
seated
pen
in
hand
as
nearly
as
possible
in
the
attitude
of
dominichino
john
and
looking
up
to
cartwright
for
inspiration
in
truth
the
vicar
though
the
dignity
of
a
secretary
was
in
some
sort
necessary
to
his
happiness
would
by
no
means
have
intrusted
the
sketching
out
of
this
document
to
any
hand
but
his
own
he
felt
it
to
be
probable
that
it
might
become
matter
of
history
and
as
such
it
demanded
his
best
attention
while
hetherington
therefore
sat
with
his
pen
between
his
fingers
like
a
charged
gun
waiting
for
the
pressure
of
the
finger
that
should
discharge
it
cartwright
with
the
ready
hand
of
a
master
produced
the
following
outline
in
pencil
cartwright
park
on
wednesday
the
july
will
be
held
a
serious
fancy
fair
on
the
lawn
of
the
rev
mansion
at
cartwright
park
for
the
promotion
of
an
object
most
precious
in
the
eyes
of
all
professing
christians
namely
the
fitting
out
a
mission
to
fababo
of
which
the
rev
isaac
isaacs
is
to
be
the
head
and
chief
to
him
being
intrusted
the
first
formation
of
an
organised
christian
establishment
for
fababo
and
its
dependencies
together
with
the
regulation
of
all
adult
and
infant
schools
therein
and
the
superintendance
of
all
the
bible
societies
throughout
the
district
large
funds
being
required
for
this
very
promising
and
useful
mission
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
in
the
neighbourhood
of
cartwright
park
are
religiously
requested
to
attend
the
serious
fancy
fair
hereby
announced
both
as
contributors
and
purchasers
whereby
they
will
ensure
the
especial
favour
of
providence
to
themselves
and
the
blessings
of
religious
and
civil
freedom
and
the
purest
evangelical
instruction
to
unnumbered
thousands
yet
unborn
of
the
natives
of
fababo
collations
will
be
served
at
three
in
five
of
the
principal
saloons
of
cartwright
mansion
prayers
to
be
pronounced
at
one
blessing
from
the
reverend
cartwright
himself
at
five
the
whole
of
the
religious
ceremonies
to
be
performed
in
the
open
air
this
sketch
as
the
inspired
author
called
it
having
been
read
aloud
and
approved
by
acclamation
was
delivered
to
the
curate
to
copy
and
as
soon
as
this
was
completed
cartwright
received
it
from
him
and
holding
it
aloft
in
his
right
hand
pronounced
aloud
in
a
very
solemn
and
impressive
manner
these
words
may
this
service
dedicated
to
the
lord
be
found
acceptable
in
his
sight
and
bring
forth
honour
and
glory
to
us
and
to
him
in
the
world
to
come
and
the
life
everlasting
amen
this
business
happily
completed
the
religious
amusements
of
the
morning
continued
to
go
on
as
usual
bateman
the
enamoured
schoolmaster
constantly
sitting
standing
and
moving
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
miss
torrington
and
the
despairing
corbold
whose
six
passionate
proposals
had
been
six
times
formally
refused
by
helen
reposing
himself
on
a
sofa
in
deep
meditation
on
the
ways
and
means
by
which
he
might
so
wheedle
or
work
himself
into
the
secrets
of
his
magnificent
cousin
as
to
make
it
necessary
for
him
to
wink
at
any
means
by
which
he
could
get
helen
into
his
power
and
so
oblige
her
to
marry
him
at
length
the
elegant
banquet
drew
the
company
from
their
tracts
and
their
talk
to
the
and
iced
champagne
refreshed
the
spirits
of
all
but
particularly
of
those
exhausted
by
the
zealous
warmth
with
which
they
had
discussed
the
sinful
adherence
to
good
works
so
frightfully
prevalent
among
the
unregenerated
clergy
of
the
church
of
england
and
ireland
this
was
a
theme
upon
which
the
majority
of
the
company
at
the
cartwright
park
meetings
never
wearied
at
length
the
final
blessing
was
pronounced
the
party
separated
and
the
tired
family
left
to
repose
themselves
as
they
best
liked
till
the
hour
of
dinner
the
increasing
delicacy
of
miss
cartwright
health
and
drooping
spirits
had
prevented
the
intimacy
between
them
from
gaining
ground
so
rapidly
as
they
had
perhaps
both
expected
when
the
families
of
the
park
and
vicarage
became
blended
into
one
yet
it
was
evident
that
rosalind
was
the
only
person
to
whom
the
pale
henrietta
ever
wished
to
speak
and
equally
so
that
rosalind
always
listened
to
her
with
interest
they
were
mounting
the
stairs
together
after
the
company
were
dispersed
when
henrietta
said
are
you
not
wearied
to
death
by
all
this
miss
torrington
oh
how
you
are
changed
since
the
time
i
told
you
that
i
had
pleasure
in
looking
at
your
face
it
was
then
the
brightest
looking
countenance
i
ever
gazed
upon
but
now
to
use
the
words
of
i
know
not
whom
all
the
sunshine
is
out
of
you
it
is
a
sorry
compliment
you
pay
me
my
dear
henrietta
but
i
believe
i
am
not
quite
the
same
sort
of
person
i
was
then
tears
started
in
her
eyes
as
she
spoke
i
have
overheard
painful
comparisons
miss
torrington
between
times
past
and
present
and
i
am
sorry
for
it
i
really
would
not
willingly
add
to
the
sorrow
and
suffering
my
race
has
brought
upon
you
do
not
go
and
sit
by
yourself
and
weep
till
you
are
sick
as
i
have
done
the
time
and
oft
let
us
take
a
very
slow
ramble
into
that
very
thickest
part
of
the
reverend
cartwright
shrubbery
where
the
sun
never
enters
shall
we
we
are
quite
fine
enough
for
such
godly
people
without
any
more
dressing
for
dinner
so
we
can
sit
in
the
shade
till
the
last
bell
rings
i
should
like
nothing
so
well
replied
rosalind
and
hastily
skirting
the
sunny
lawn
they
took
their
stations
on
a
seat
which
the
morning
sun
visited
as
if
on
purpose
to
prevent
its
being
dark
and
damp
but
which
for
the
rest
of
the
hours
remained
almost
as
cool
as
if
there
were
no
such
globe
in
the
heavens
we
are
growing
very
seriously
gay
rosalind
are
we
not
said
henrietta
in
a
lighter
tone
than
she
usually
indulged
in
used
to
be
the
exclusive
property
of
the
worldlings
but
it
seems
that
we
are
now
to
come
in
for
a
share
of
their
fraudulent
charity
and
their
vain
benevolence
not
a
bad
pun
that
rosalind
if
i
had
but
intended
to
make
one
but
do
tell
me
if
you
do
not
think
cartwright
has
a
magnificent
taste
very
for
a
person
who
professes
himself
so
given
to
the
contemplation
of
things
above
the
world
but
to
tell
you
the
truth
henrietta
i
am
much
less
surprised
at
the
manner
in
which
he
displays
his
riches
than
at
the
continuance
of
his
saintly
professions
i
expected
that
the
vicarage
of
wrexhill
would
have
been
resigned
and
all
the
world
peaceably
permitted
to
be
just
as
wicked
as
they
liked
without
cartwright
of
cartwright
park
giving
himself
the
least
trouble
concerning
it
you
little
know
the
nature
of
the
clique
to
which
he
belongs
that
they
value
pleasure
fully
as
much
as
other
men
is
quite
certain
that
they
struggle
for
riches
with
anxiety
as
acute
and
hold
it
with
a
grasp
as
tight
as
any
human
beings
can
do
it
were
equally
impossible
to
doubt
but
that
power
is
dearer
to
them
than
either
is
a
truth
well
known
to
all
who
have
sat
within
the
conventicle
and
watched
its
professors
as
i
have
done
but
how
can
a
man
so
addicted
to
as
it
is
evident
cartwright
is
endure
the
sort
of
trouble
which
the
charge
of
a
living
must
inevitably
bring
with
it
especially
in
the
style
so
universally
practised
i
believe
by
all
serious
ministers
that
of
interfering
with
the
affairs
of
every
individual
in
their
parish
it
is
that
interference
that
makes
the
labour
a
joy
but
you
are
not
initiated
and
can
not
comprehend
it
you
do
not
i
am
sure
conceive
the
delight
of
feeling
that
not
a
man
or
woman
not
a
boy
or
girl
in
the
parish
either
do
or
leave
undone
any
single
act
of
labour
or
of
relaxation
without
thinking
whether
cartwright
would
approve
it
and
then
the
dependence
of
so
many
on
him
for
their
daily
bread
the
curate
the
clerk
the
sexton
the
beadle
and
the
schoolmaster
and
the
schoolmaster
assistant
and
the
apothecary
and
the
attorney
and
the
undertaker
and
dozens
of
poor
dependent
simpletons
besides
who
if
like
poor
seymour
they
knew
the
walley
of
peace
and
quiet
would
run
away
to
batten
on
the
first
moor
they
came
to
rather
than
endure
the
slavery
of
living
dependent
upon
the
favour
of
a
fanatical
divine
whatever
it
may
be
to
them
however
depend
upon
it
that
to
him
and
the
like
of
him
this
petty
power
this
minute
tyranny
of
interference
is
dearer
than
the
breath
of
life
and
that
much
as
cartwright
loves
his
fair
lady
and
all
that
belongs
to
her
he
would
think
that
all
still
dearly
purchased
were
he
thereby
to
lose
the
right
of
entering
every
house
in
the
parish
and
unblushingly
to
ask
them
what
they
have
done
are
doing
and
are
about
to
do
the
conversation
then
rambled
on
to
all
things
connected
with
the
and
its
object
till
they
had
talked
themselves
tired
and
then
they
sat
silently
watching
the
beautiful
of
light
and
shade
which
fell
on
the
before
them
till
the
languid
henrietta
resting
her
head
against
a
tree
fell
fast
asleep
rosalind
sat
beside
her
for
some
minutes
but
growing
weary
of
the
extreme
stillness
necessary
to
guard
her
slumbers
she
quietly
withdrew
herself
and
wandered
on
under
the
trees
having
left
the
sleeper
for
about
half
an
hour
she
turned
to
walk
gently
back
again
but
fancying
as
she
approached
the
spot
that
she
heard
the
sound
of
a
man
voice
she
slanted
off
by
another
path
which
took
her
close
behind
the
seat
occupied
by
miss
cartwright
though
a
thick
laurel
hedge
rendered
it
impossible
for
any
one
to
see
or
be
seen
from
the
other
the
hedge
though
a
good
one
had
not
however
the
same
effect
on
sound
as
on
sight
and
rosalind
was
not
a
little
startled
as
her
soft
footfall
silently
drew
near
the
seat
to
hear
a
very
passionate
declaration
of
love
in
the
drawling
voice
of
hetherington
she
stopped
by
no
means
from
any
wish
to
hear
more
but
greatly
embarrassed
lest
her
step
being
heard
she
might
appear
to
have
stolen
to
this
obscure
spot
for
the
express
purpose
of
being
a
listener
make
me
the
happiest
of
men
adored
miss
cartwright
reiterated
the
young
man
your
father
has
permitted
my
addresses
then
do
not
you
most
charming
henrietta
refuse
to
listen
to
them
it
would
not
be
for
your
happiness
sir
replied
the
deep
low
voice
of
henrietta
that
i
should
do
so
let
me
be
the
judge
of
that
oh
if
such
a
fear
be
all
that
parts
us
we
shall
not
lovely
miss
cartwright
be
long
asunder
replied
the
ardent
hetherington
i
know
myself
sir
said
henrietta
far
better
than
you
can
know
me
and
though
we
have
not
been
long
acquainted
your
situation
as
curate
of
the
parish
enables
me
to
know
your
sentiments
and
opinions
better
than
you
can
know
mine
i
hear
you
preach
twice
every
sunday
hetherington
and
i
do
assure
you
there
is
not
a
single
question
of
importance
on
which
we
think
alike
name
them
sweet
henrietta
generously
tell
me
wherein
we
differ
and
trust
me
that
it
shall
be
the
study
of
my
life
to
bring
my
opinions
into
conformity
with
yours
i
heard
you
in
the
middle
of
your
sermon
last
sunday
stop
short
to
scold
a
little
boy
who
had
accidentally
made
a
noise
by
letting
his
hat
fall
on
the
ground
you
said
to
him
next
sunday
you
may
be
brought
into
this
church
in
your
coffin
i
saw
the
little
fellow
turn
pale
yet
you
repeated
the
words
i
really
should
not
like
to
marry
any
one
who
could
so
terrify
little
boys
for
he
might
perhaps
think
it
right
to
terrify
me
also
never
oh
never
again
will
i
so
offend
you
and
for
yourself
beloved
miss
cartwright
what
could
i
say
to
you
but
words
of
hope
and
joy
neither
your
joy
nor
your
hope
hetherington
would
do
me
much
good
i
am
afraid
in
one
word
much
as
it
will
surprise
you
to
hear
it
from
my
father
daughter
i
am
not
evangelical
sir
it
is
but
a
reason
the
more
for
my
wishing
to
call
you
mine
if
my
opinions
are
unsound
you
shall
correct
them
i
wish
you
would
be
persuaded
hetherington
to
desist
from
this
suit
i
know
that
if
my
father
has
permitted
it
i
may
find
it
become
very
troublesome
to
me
unless
you
have
yourself
the
generosity
to
withdraw
it
for
my
father
does
not
brook
contradiction
ask
any
proof
of
my
obedience
but
this
and
you
shall
find
me
a
slave
having
no
will
but
that
of
my
charming
mistress
but
to
resign
you
while
i
enjoy
the
inestimable
privilege
of
your
illustrious
father
sanction
it
is
impossible
then
sir
said
henrietta
in
an
altered
voice
that
betokened
strong
emotion
if
nothing
less
will
save
me
from
this
persecution
i
will
disclose
to
you
the
great
secret
of
my
life
make
of
it
what
use
you
will
i
am
an
atheist
surely
you
can
not
suppose
my
beloved
miss
cartwright
that
this
confession
can
produce
any
effect
upon
my
love
unless
indeed
it
be
to
augment
it
what
noble
frankness
what
confiding
trust
believe
me
there
can
be
no
difference
of
opinion
between
us
on
any
subject
sufficiently
strong
to
conquer
the
tender
and
powerful
passion
you
have
inspired
yield
then
to
the
soft
violence
which
i
know
will
be
sanctioned
by
your
respected
father
let
me
thus
leave
me
wretch
exclaimed
henrietta
in
a
voice
that
made
rosalind
tremble
he
may
lock
me
up
and
me
for
he
has
done
it
before
to
make
me
obey
his
will
and
i
have
obeyed
it
and
hated
myself
for
my
cowardice
but
i
will
not
marry
you
hetherington
even
should
he
treat
me
worse
than
he
has
yet
done
which
would
not
be
easy
go
sir
go
i
am
an
atheist
but
horrible
as
that
sounds
even
to
my
own
ears
it
is
better
than
to
be
what
you
have
proved
yourself
rosalind
hardly
less
agitated
than
henrietta
appeared
to
be
stood
trembling
from
head
to
foot
in
her
retreat
till
aware
that
the
unscrupulous
hetherington
had
retreated
in
one
direction
and
the
unhappy
henrietta
returned
to
the
house
by
another
chapter
vi
a
second
visit
to
the
rosalind
as
she
walked
slowly
back
towards
the
house
repeated
to
herself
in
shuddering
the
fearful
words
of
henrietta
cartwright
i
am
an
atheist
and
her
very
soul
seemed
sick
and
faint
within
her
she
had
sought
in
some
degree
the
friendship
of
this
unhappy
girl
chiefly
because
it
was
evident
that
not
even
the
connexion
of
father
and
daughter
had
sufficed
to
blind
her
to
the
hateful
hypocrisy
and
unholy
fanaticism
of
the
vicar
did
then
hatred
and
contempt
for
him
lead
to
the
hideous
abyss
of
atheism
she
trembled
as
she
asked
herself
the
question
but
the
weakness
lasted
not
a
moment
the
simple
and
true
piety
of
her
spirit
awoke
within
her
and
with
kindly
warmth
cheered
and
revived
her
heart
that
the
unhappy
henrietta
when
revolted
by
watching
the
false
religion
of
her
father
should
have
fled
from
it
with
such
passionate
vehemence
as
to
plunge
her
into
the
extreme
of
scepticism
offered
no
precedent
for
what
would
be
likely
to
befall
a
person
who
like
her
loathed
the
dark
sin
of
hypocrisy
but
who
unlike
her
had
learned
the
benignant
truths
of
religion
with
no
false
and
frightful
commentaries
to
disfigure
them
as
she
remembered
this
as
she
remembered
that
probably
the
only
religious
lessons
ever
given
to
this
most
unhappy
girl
were
such
as
her
judgment
must
revolt
from
and
the
sincerity
of
her
nature
detest
as
false
and
feigned
pity
and
compassion
took
place
of
terror
and
repugnance
and
a
timid
but
most
earnest
wish
that
she
might
herself
be
the
means
of
sending
a
ray
of
divine
light
to
cheer
the
fearful
gloom
of
poor
henrietta
mind
took
possession
of
her
heart
the
delightful
glow
of
feeling
that
seemed
to
pervade
every
nerve
of
rosalind
as
this
thought
took
possession
of
her
can
not
be
described
tears
again
filled
her
beautiful
eyes
but
they
were
no
longer
the
tears
of
disappointment
and
despondency
yet
a
dread
of
incurring
the
guilt
of
presumption
by
assuming
the
office
of
teacher
on
a
theme
so
awfully
important
so
sublimely
exalted
mixed
fear
with
her
hope
and
she
determined
to
restrict
her
efforts
wholly
to
the
selection
of
such
books
as
might
tend
to
enlighten
the
dark
night
of
that
perverted
mind
without
producing
in
it
the
painful
confusion
of
thought
which
must
ever
result
from
a
loose
and
unlogical
arrangement
of
proofs
and
arguments
however
sound
or
however
unquestionable
they
may
individually
be
when
she
met
henrietta
in
the
where
all
the
family
were
assembled
before
dinner
she
was
conscious
of
being
so
full
of
thoughts
concerning
her
that
she
almost
feared
to
encounter
her
eyes
lest
her
own
might
prematurely
disclose
her
being
acquainted
with
the
scene
she
had
gone
through
but
the
moment
she
heard
henrietta
speak
the
sound
of
her
voice
so
quiet
so
cold
so
perfectly
composed
convinced
her
that
the
conversation
which
she
had
supposed
must
have
agitated
her
so
dreadfully
had
in
truth
produced
no
effect
on
her
whatever
and
when
taking
courage
from
this
she
ventured
to
speak
to
and
look
at
her
the
civil
smile
the
unaltered
eye
the
easy
allusion
to
their
walk
and
their
separation
led
her
almost
to
doubt
her
senses
as
to
the
identity
of
the
being
now
before
her
and
the
one
to
whom
she
had
listened
in
horror
a
short
ago
this
perplexity
was
however
in
a
great
measure
relieved
by
an
interpretation
suggested
by
her
fancy
and
immediately
and
eagerly
received
by
her
as
truth
it
was
in
bitter
irony
and
shrewdly
to
test
the
sincerity
of
that
man
assumed
sanctity
that
she
uttered
those
terrible
words
thought
rosalind
and
inexpressibly
relieved
by
the
supposition
she
determined
to
take
an
early
opportunity
of
confessing
to
miss
cartwright
her
involuntary
participation
of
hetherington
tender
avowal
and
of
her
own
temporary
credulity
in
believing
for
a
moment
that
what
was
uttered
either
to
get
rid
of
him
or
to
prove
the
little
worth
of
his
pretended
righteousness
was
a
serious
avowal
of
her
secret
sentiments
this
opportunity
was
not
long
wanting
for
perfectly
unconscious
that
miss
torrington
motive
for
hovering
near
her
was
to
seek
a
confidential
conversation
a
species
of
communication
from
which
she
always
shrunk
henrietta
who
really
liked
and
admired
her
more
than
any
person
she
had
ever
met
with
readily
seconded
her
wish
by
again
wandering
into
the
on
which
the
sun
had
just
poured
his
parting
beams
and
where
the
full
moon
rising
at
the
same
moment
to
take
her
turn
of
rule
shone
with
a
splendour
increasing
every
moment
and
rendering
the
night
more
than
a
rival
in
beauty
to
the
day
let
us
go
to
the
same
seat
we
occupied
this
morning
said
rosalind
no
no
go
anywhere
else
and
i
shall
like
it
better
let
us
go
where
we
can
see
the
moon
rise
and
watch
her
till
she
reaches
her
highest
noon
of
all
the
toys
of
creation
it
is
the
prettiest
shall
you
be
afraid
to
go
as
far
as
the
asked
rosalind
what
the
tree
of
trees
the
bower
of
paradise
in
short
the
tree
that
you
and
i
have
once
before
visited
together
the
same
there
is
no
point
from
whence
the
rising
moon
is
seen
to
such
advantage
come
along
then
let
us
each
put
on
the
armour
of
a
good
shawl
and
steal
away
from
this
superlatively
dull
party
by
the
the
two
girls
walked
on
together
both
clad
in
white
both
raising
a
fair
young
face
to
the
clear
heavens
both
rejoicing
in
the
sweet
breath
of
evening
heavy
with
odours
yet
thus
alike
the
wide
earth
is
not
ample
enough
to
serve
as
a
type
whereby
to
measure
the
distance
that
severed
them
the
adoration
the
joy
the
hope
of
rosalind
as
her
thoughts
rose
from
nature
up
to
nature
god
beamed
from
her
full
eye
thankfulness
and
love
swelled
her
young
heart
and
every
thought
and
every
feeling
was
a
hymn
of
praise
henrietta
as
she
walked
beside
her
though
sharing
nature
banquet
so
lavishly
prepared
for
every
sense
like
a
thankless
guest
bestowed
no
thought
upon
the
hand
that
gave
it
cold
dark
and
comfortless
was
the
spirit
within
her
she
saw
that
all
was
beautiful
but
remembered
not
that
all
was
good
and
the
thankless
heart
heaved
with
no
throb
of
worship
to
the
eternal
creator
who
made
the
lovely
world
and
then
made
her
to
use
it
notwithstanding
the
interpretation
which
rosalind
had
put
upon
the
works
spoken
by
henrietta
in
the
morning
and
the
consolation
she
had
drawn
from
it
it
was
not
without
considerable
agitation
that
she
anticipated
the
conversation
she
was
meditating
if
she
were
mistaken
if
beneath
that
pure
sky
from
whence
the
eye
of
heaven
seemed
to
look
down
upon
them
she
were
again
to
hear
the
same
terrific
words
how
should
she
answer
them
how
should
she
find
breath
and
strength
and
thought
and
language
to
speak
on
such
a
theme
she
trembled
at
her
own
temerity
as
this
fear
pressed
upon
her
and
inwardly
prayed
in
most
true
and
sweet
humility
for
forgiveness
for
her
presumptuous
sin
a
prayer
so
offered
never
fails
of
leaving
in
the
breast
it
springs
from
a
cheering
glow
that
seems
like
an
assurance
of
its
being
heard
like
that
air
which
blazes
as
it
exhales
itself
prayer
simple
sincere
unostentatious
prayer
sheds
light
and
warmth
upon
the
soul
that
breathes
it
even
by
the
act
of
breathing
they
had
however
reached
the
seat
beneath
the
before
rosalind
found
courage
to
begin
and
then
she
said
as
they
seated
themselves
beneath
the
spreading
canopy
miss
cartwright
i
have
a
confession
to
make
to
you
to
me
pray
what
is
it
to
judge
by
the
place
you
have
chosen
for
your
confessional
it
should
be
something
rather
solemn
and
majestical
do
you
remember
that
i
left
you
on
the
this
morning
fast
asleep
oh
you
mean
then
to
confess
that
the
doing
so
was
unwatchful
and
unfriendly
and
indeed
i
think
it
was
how
did
you
know
but
i
might
be
awakened
by
some
venomous
reptile
that
should
come
to
sting
me
believe
me
i
thought
the
place
secure
from
interruption
of
every
kind
but
i
had
reason
to
think
afterwards
that
it
did
not
prove
so
what
do
you
mean
miss
torrington
replied
henrietta
in
an
accent
of
some
asperity
i
presume
you
did
not
creep
away
for
the
purpose
of
spying
at
me
from
a
distance
oh
no
you
can
not
i
am
sure
suspect
me
of
wishing
to
spy
at
you
at
all
and
yet
things
have
so
fallen
out
that
when
i
tell
you
all
you
must
suspect
me
of
it
unless
you
believe
me
as
i
trust
you
do
incapable
of
such
an
action
pray
do
not
speak
in
riddles
said
henrietta
impatiently
what
is
it
you
have
got
to
confess
to
me
tell
me
at
once
miss
torrington
you
really
do
not
encourage
me
to
be
very
frank
with
you
for
you
seem
angry
already
but
the
truth
is
miss
cartwright
that
i
did
most
unintentionally
overhear
your
conversation
with
mr
hetherington
the
whole
of
it
did
you
hear
the
whole
of
it
rosalind
not
quite
the
gentleman
appeared
to
be
in
the
midst
of
his
declaration
when
my
unwilling
ears
became
his
confidants
and
then
you
listened
to
the
end
i
did
a
deathlike
silence
followed
this
avowal
which
was
at
last
broken
by
henrietta
who
said
in
a
low
whisper
then
at
last
you
know
me
oh
do
not
say
so
do
not
say
that
the
fearful
words
that
i
heard
were
spoken
in
earnest
do
not
say
that
i
can
not
bear
to
hear
it
poor
girl
poor
rosalind
said
henrietta
in
a
voice
of
the
deepest
melancholy
i
have
always
wished
to
spare
you
this
i
have
always
wished
to
spare
myself
the
pain
of
reading
abhorrence
in
the
eyes
of
one
that
i
do
believe
i
could
have
loved
had
not
my
heart
been
dead
but
if
you
feel
thus
henrietta
if
indeed
you
know
that
such
words
as
i
heard
you
utter
must
raise
abhorrence
it
is
because
that
you
yourself
must
hate
them
i
know
you
are
unhappy
i
know
that
your
nature
scorns
the
faults
that
are
but
too
conspicuous
in
your
father
but
is
it
not
beneath
a
mind
of
such
power
as
yours
to
think
there
is
no
god
in
heaven
because
one
weak
and
wicked
man
has
worshipped
him
amiss
he
worship
trust
me
rosalind
had
i
been
the
child
of
a
persian
and
seen
him
in
spirit
and
in
truth
worshipping
the
broad
sun
as
it
looked
down
from
heaven
upon
earth
making
its
fragrant
dews
rise
up
to
him
in
incense
i
should
not
have
been
the
wretched
thing
i
am
for
i
should
have
worshipped
too
henrietta
if
to
behold
the
maker
of
the
universe
and
the
redeemer
whom
he
sent
to
teach
his
law
if
to
see
worship
offered
to
their
eternal
throne
could
teach
you
to
worship
too
then
look
around
you
look
at
the
poor
in
heart
the
humble
pious
christians
who
instead
of
uttering
the
horrible
doom
of
eternal
damnation
upon
their
live
and
die
in
the
delightful
hope
that
all
shall
one
day
meet
in
the
presence
of
their
god
and
father
chastised
purified
and
pleading
to
his
everlasting
mercy
with
the
promised
aid
of
his
begotten
son
for
pardon
and
for
look
out
for
this
henrietta
and
you
will
find
it
find
it
and
your
heart
will
be
softened
and
you
will
share
the
healing
balm
that
makes
all
the
sorrow
and
suffering
of
this
life
seem
but
as
the
too
close
fitting
of
a
heavy
garment
that
galls
but
for
an
hour
dear
innocent
rosalind
how
pure
and
beautiful
your
face
looks
in
the
bright
moonlight
but
alas
i
know
that
very
sinful
faces
may
look
just
as
fair
there
is
no
truth
to
rest
on
in
the
whole
wide
world
rosalind
there
is
not
honesty
enough
whereon
to
set
a
foot
that
one
may
look
around
and
believe
at
least
that
what
one
sees
one
sees
but
this
is
a
perfection
of
holiness
a
species
of
palpable
and
present
divinity
that
is
only
granted
to
mortals
in
their
multiplication
twice
two
are
four
i
feel
sure
of
it
but
my
faith
goes
no
farther
i
can
not
talk
to
you
cried
rosalind
in
great
agitation
i
am
not
capable
of
doing
justice
to
this
portentous
theme
on
which
hangs
the
eternal
life
of
all
the
men
that
have
been
are
and
shall
be
it
is
profane
in
me
to
speak
of
it
a
child
a
worm
father
of
mercy
forgive
me
she
cried
suddenly
dropping
upon
her
knees
henrietta
uttered
a
cry
which
almost
amounted
to
a
shriek
i
had
almost
listened
to
you
she
exclaimed
i
had
almost
believed
that
your
voice
was
the
voice
of
truth
but
now
you
put
yourself
in
that
hateful
posture
and
what
can
i
think
of
you
but
that
you
are
all
alike
all
juggling
all
the
best
of
ye
juggle
yourselves
the
worst
do
as
we
saw
cartwright
do
on
that
very
spot
rosalind
beneath
the
shelter
of
that
very
tree
did
he
not
too
knuckle
down
and
for
what
to
lure
and
cajole
a
free
and
innocent
spirit
to
be
as
false
and
foul
as
himself
yet
this
is
the
best
trick
of
which
you
can
bethink
you
to
teach
the
sceptical
henrietta
that
there
is
a
god
truth
henrietta
said
rosalind
rising
up
and
speaking
in
a
tone
that
indicated
more
contempt
than
anger
neither
truth
nor
falsehood
can
be
tested
by
a
posture
of
the
body
it
is
but
a
childish
cavil
the
stupendous
question
whether
this
world
and
all
the
wonders
it
contains
be
the
work
of
chance
or
of
unlimited
power
and
goodness
conceiving
arranging
and
governing
the
whole
can
hardly
depend
for
its
solution
upon
the
angle
in
which
the
joints
are
bent
you
have
read
much
miss
cartwright
read
one
little
passage
more
which
i
think
may
have
escaped
you
read
the
short
and
simple
instructions
given
as
to
the
manner
in
which
prayer
should
be
offered
up
read
this
passage
of
some
dozen
lines
and
i
think
you
will
allow
that
in
following
these
instructions
greatly
as
they
have
been
misconstrued
and
abused
there
is
nothing
that
can
justify
the
vehement
indignation
which
you
express
poor
henrietta
shrunk
more
abashed
before
this
simple
word
of
common
sense
than
she
would
have
done
before
the
revealed
word
rosalind
saw
this
and
pointed
out
the
anomaly
to
her
simply
but
strongly
does
it
not
show
a
mind
diseased
she
continued
you
feel
that
you
were
wrong
to
make
an
attitude
a
matter
of
importance
and
you
are
ashamed
of
it
but
from
the
question
whether
you
shall
exist
in
pure
and
intellectual
beatitude
through
countless
ages
or
perish
you
turn
with
contempt
as
too
trifling
and
puerile
to
merit
your
attention
if
i
do
turn
from
it
rosalind
if
i
do
think
the
examination
of
such
a
question
a
puerile
occupation
it
is
in
the
same
spirit
that
i
should
decline
to
share
the
employment
of
a
child
who
would
set
about
counting
the
stars
such
knowledge
is
too
excellent
for
me
i
can
not
attain
unto
it
your
illustration
would
be
more
correct
henrietta
were
you
to
say
that
you
shut
your
eyes
and
would
not
see
the
stars
upon
the
same
principle
that
you
declined
inquiring
into
the
future
hopes
of
man
it
would
be
quite
as
reasonable
to
refuse
to
look
at
the
stars
because
you
can
not
count
them
as
to
close
your
eyes
upon
the
book
of
life
because
it
tells
of
intellectual
power
beyond
your
but
this
is
all
contrary
to
my
resolution
henrietta
contrary
to
all
my
hopes
for
your
future
happiness
do
not
listen
to
me
do
not
hang
a
chance
dearer
than
life
upon
the
crude
reasonings
of
an
untaught
woman
will
you
read
henrietta
if
i
will
find
you
books
and
put
them
in
your
hands
will
you
read
them
and
keep
your
judgment
free
and
clear
from
any
foregone
conclusion
that
every
word
that
speaks
of
the
existence
and
providence
of
god
must
be
a
falsehood
will
you
promise
me
this
let
us
go
home
rosalind
my
head
is
giddy
and
my
heart
is
sick
i
had
hoped
never
again
to
fever
my
aching
brain
in
attempting
to
sift
the
truth
from
all
the
lies
that
may
and
must
surround
it
i
have
made
my
choice
deliberately
rosalind
i
have
never
seen
sin
and
wickedness
flourish
any
where
so
rapidly
and
so
vigorously
as
where
it
has
been
decked
in
the
masquerading
trappings
of
religion
i
hate
sin
rosalind
and
i
have
thrown
aside
for
ever
the
hateful
garb
in
which
i
have
been
used
to
see
it
clothed
if
there
be
a
god
can
i
stand
guilty
before
his
eyes
for
this
oh
yes
most
guilty
if
you
have
found
hypocrisy
and
sin
turn
from
it
with
all
the
loathing
that
you
will
and
be
very
sure
let
it
wear
what
mask
it
will
that
religion
is
not
there
look
then
elsewhere
for
it
be
not
frightened
by
a
bugbear
a
phantom
from
seeking
what
it
is
so
precious
to
find
dearest
henrietta
will
you
not
listen
to
me
will
you
not
promise
for
a
while
to
turn
your
thoughts
from
every
lighter
thing
till
you
are
able
to
form
a
surer
judgment
upon
this
dearest
do
you
call
me
dear
and
dearest
rosalind
know
you
that
i
have
lived
in
almost
abject
terror
lest
you
should
discover
the
condition
of
my
mind
i
thought
you
would
hate
and
shun
rosalind
torrington
you
are
a
beautiful
specimen
and
a
very
rare
one
to
please
you
and
to
approach
you
if
i
could
i
would
read
much
and
think
and
reason
more
and
try
to
hope
again
as
i
did
once
until
i
was
stretched
upon
the
torturing
rack
of
fear
but
there
is
no
time
left
me
do
not
say
that
dear
friend
said
rosalind
gently
drawing
henrietta
cold
and
trembling
arm
within
her
own
you
are
still
so
young
that
time
is
left
for
harder
studies
than
any
i
propose
to
you
i
am
dying
rosalind
i
have
told
you
so
before
but
you
can
not
believe
me
because
i
move
about
and
send
for
no
doctor
but
i
am
dying
and
if
i
could
believe
it
henrietta
would
not
that
be
the
greatest
cause
of
all
for
this
healing
study
that
i
want
to
give
you
perhaps
so
rosalind
but
my
mind
my
intellect
is
weak
and
wayward
if
there
be
a
possibility
that
i
should
ever
again
turn
my
eyes
to
seek
for
light
where
i
have
long
believed
that
all
was
darkness
it
must
be
even
when
and
where
my
sickly
fancy
here
let
the
subject
drop
between
us
perhaps
sweet
girl
i
dread
as
much
the
chance
of
my
perverting
you
as
you
can
hope
to
convert
me
rosalind
was
uttering
a
protest
against
this
idle
fear
when
henrietta
stopped
her
by
again
saying
and
very
earnestly
let
the
subject
drop
between
us
lay
the
books
you
speak
of
in
my
room
where
i
can
find
them
but
let
us
speak
no
more
satisfied
fully
satisfied
with
this
permission
rosalind
determined
to
obey
her
injunction
scrupulously
and
silently
pressing
her
arm
in
testimony
of
her
acquiescence
they
returned
to
the
house
without
uttering
another
word
chapter
vii
the
will
it
was
about
this
time
that
cartwright
for
reasons
which
will
be
sufficiently
evident
in
the
sequel
set
about
convincing
his
wife
that
there
was
a
very
pressing
necessity
from
motives
both
temporal
and
spiritual
that
her
son
charles
should
be
immediately
ordained
there
are
many
ways
of
convincing
a
woman
and
a
wife
besides
beating
and
cartwright
employed
them
all
by
turns
till
his
lady
like
a
bit
of
plastic
dough
took
exactly
the
impression
he
chose
to
give
as
evanescent
too
as
it
was
deep
for
he
could
make
her
act
on
monday
in
direct
opposition
to
the
principles
he
had
laid
down
on
saturday
yet
leave
her
persuaded
all
the
while
that
he
was
the
wisest
and
best
as
well
as
the
most
enamoured
of
men
but
though
living
with
the
wife
of
his
bosom
in
the
most
delightful
harmony
and
opening
his
heart
to
her
with
the
most
engaging
frankness
on
a
thousand
little
trifling
concerns
that
a
less
tender
husband
might
never
have
thought
it
necessary
to
mention
cartwright
nevertheless
did
not
deem
it
expedient
to
trouble
her
with
the
perusal
of
his
letter
to
charles
on
the
subject
of
his
immediate
ordination
the
especial
object
of
this
letter
was
to
obtain
a
decided
refusal
to
the
command
it
contained
and
like
most
of
the
vicar
of
plans
it
answered
completely
mowbray
reply
contained
only
these
words
sir
though
all
my
hopes
for
this
life
have
been
blighted
through
your
agency
i
will
not
risk
my
happiness
in
that
which
is
to
come
by
impiously
taking
upon
me
the
office
of
god
minister
for
which
i
am
in
no
way
prepared
charles
mowbray
as
soon
as
this
letter
was
received
read
and
committed
to
the
flames
cartwright
repaired
to
the
of
his
lady
where
as
usual
he
found
her
reposing
on
the
sofa
a
little
table
beside
her
loaded
with
tracts
and
other
fanatical
publications
and
in
her
hand
a
small
bit
of
very
delicate
embroidery
which
was
in
time
to
take
the
form
of
a
baby
cap
my
sweet
love
how
have
you
been
since
breakfast
oh
my
clara
how
that
occupation
touches
my
heart
but
take
care
of
your
precious
health
my
angel
my
life
is
now
bound
up
with
yours
sweet
ten
thousand
times
more
closely
than
it
ever
was
before
and
not
mine
only
the
life
of
the
dear
unborn
being
so
inexpressibly
dear
to
us
both
remember
this
my
lovely
wife
oh
cartwright
your
tender
affection
makes
me
the
happiest
of
women
never
surely
was
there
a
husband
who
continued
so
completely
a
lover
were
my
children
but
one
half
as
sensible
of
their
happiness
in
having
you
for
a
father
as
i
am
in
calling
you
my
husband
i
should
have
nothing
left
to
wish
turn
not
your
thoughts
that
way
my
clara
it
is
there
that
it
hath
pleased
heaven
to
visit
us
with
very
sore
affliction
but
our
duty
is
to
remember
his
mercies
alway
and
so
to
meet
and
wrestle
with
the
difficulties
which
he
hath
for
his
own
glory
permitted
the
evil
one
to
scatter
in
our
path
that
in
the
end
we
may
overcome
them
then
shall
we
by
the
heel
crush
the
head
of
the
serpent
and
so
shall
his
mercy
upon
his
chosen
servants
shine
out
and
appear
with
exceeding
splendour
and
with
lasting
joy
heaven
prosper
your
endeavours
my
dear
cartwright
to
bring
the
same
to
good
effect
how
i
wish
that
helen
would
make
up
her
mind
at
once
to
marry
corbold
i
am
sure
that
with
your
remarkably
generous
feelings
you
would
not
object
to
giving
her
immediately
a
very
handsome
fortune
if
she
would
comply
with
our
wishes
in
this
respect
corbold
told
me
yesterday
that
he
had
every
reason
to
believe
she
was
passionately
attached
to
him
but
that
her
brother
had
made
her
promise
to
refuse
this
interference
of
charles
is
really
unpardonable
i
do
not
scruple
to
say
that
in
my
situation
it
would
be
infinitely
more
agreeable
to
me
if
helen
were
married
we
could
give
miss
torrington
leave
to
live
with
her
dear
cartwright
and
i
am
quite
sure
the
change
would
be
for
the
happiness
of
us
all
unquestionably
it
would
my
love
but
this
unfortunate
boy
alas
my
clara
i
have
just
received
fresh
proof
of
the
rebellious
spirit
that
mocks
at
all
authority
and
hates
the
hand
that
would
use
it
i
have
this
morning
received
such
a
letter
from
him
in
answer
to
that
in
which
i
expressed
my
wish
that
he
should
adopt
a
profession
and
prepare
to
settle
himself
in
life
as
wrung
my
heart
it
shall
never
blast
your
eyes
my
clara
i
watched
it
consume
and
burn
and
turn
to
harmless
ashes
before
i
came
to
cheer
and
heal
my
wounded
heart
by
pressing
thee
to
it
the
action
answered
to
the
word
and
it
was
from
the
bosom
of
her
fond
husband
that
cartwright
murmured
her
inquiries
as
to
what
her
unworthy
son
had
now
done
to
pain
the
best
of
fathers
not
only
refused
dearest
to
adopt
the
sacred
and
saving
profession
we
have
chosen
for
him
with
the
most
ribald
insolence
but
addressed
me
in
words
of
such
bitter
scorn
that
not
for
worlds
would
i
have
suffered
thy
dear
eyes
to
rest
upon
them
is
it
possible
what
then
dear
cartwright
will
it
be
best
for
us
to
do
it
is
terrible
to
leave
him
to
his
own
wilful
desire
and
suffer
him
to
enter
the
army
when
we
know
it
will
lead
him
to
inevitable
perdition
what
can
we
do
to
save
him
it
appears
to
me
my
sweet
love
that
at
the
present
moment
it
will
be
most
consonant
to
the
will
of
the
lord
to
use
towards
him
the
most
indulgent
gentleness
my
dearest
cartwright
after
such
conduct
on
his
part
oh
you
are
too
good
sweetest
he
is
your
son
i
can
never
forget
that
though
i
fear
that
he
himself
does
not
too
well
remember
this
if
he
did
my
clara
he
would
hardly
utter
such
bitter
jestings
on
what
he
is
so
cruel
as
to
call
beggarly
dependence
on
you
this
phrase
has
cut
me
to
the
heart
core
i
will
not
deny
it
clara
it
has
made
me
feel
my
position
and
shudder
at
it
cartwright
here
rose
from
the
sofa
and
putting
his
handkerchief
to
his
eyes
walked
towards
the
window
his
breast
heaved
with
audible
sobs
my
beloved
cartwright
what
mean
you
exclaimed
his
affectionate
wife
following
him
to
the
window
and
gently
attempting
to
withdraw
the
cambric
that
concealed
his
features
what
can
that
undutiful
boy
mean
your
dependence
upon
me
good
heaven
is
there
any
thing
that
was
ever
mine
that
is
not
now
your
own
alas
dear
love
he
has
not
launched
a
random
shot
he
knows
but
too
well
how
to
take
aim
and
how
to
point
his
dart
and
it
has
done
its
work
this
was
spoken
in
a
tone
of
such
profound
sadness
that
the
soul
of
cartwright
was
moved
by
it
she
threw
her
arms
around
her
neck
and
fondly
kissing
him
implored
that
he
would
tell
her
if
there
were
any
thing
she
could
do
to
prove
her
love
and
place
him
in
a
situation
at
to
render
the
repetition
of
such
a
hateful
phrase
impossible
i
thought
she
continued
that
your
being
my
husband
dearest
cartwright
gave
you
a
right
to
all
i
is
it
not
so
my
love
to
your
income
dearest
clara
during
your
life
and
as
you
are
several
years
my
junior
sweetest
this
as
far
as
my
wants
and
wishes
are
concerned
is
quite
enough
but
the
young
man
has
doubtless
found
some
wily
lawyer
to
inform
him
that
should
you
die
intestate
he
would
be
your
heir
as
by
your
late
husband
will
my
love
though
he
has
left
every
thing
to
you
should
you
not
make
a
will
every
shilling
of
the
property
will
go
to
him
whatever
other
children
you
have
now
or
may
have
hereafter
oh
cartwright
why
did
you
not
tell
me
this
before
should
any
thing
happen
to
me
in
the
hour
of
danger
that
is
approaching
think
what
a
dreadful
injustice
would
be
done
to
all
let
me
not
delay
another
day
do
send
for
corbold
i
can
not
rest
till
all
this
is
set
right
my
dear
unborn
babe
as
well
as
its
beloved
father
may
reproach
me
for
this
cruel
carelessness
compose
yourself
sweet
clara
i
send
for
corbold
without
delay
but
for
heaven
sale
do
not
agitate
your
dear
spirits
it
was
the
fear
of
this
which
has
alone
prevented
me
from
reminding
you
of
the
interest
of
our
dear
unborn
babe
and
your
own
my
dear
generous
husband
do
you
doubt
dear
cartwright
that
the
father
interest
is
as
dear
to
me
as
the
child
a
tender
caress
answered
this
question
but
delay
in
matters
of
business
was
not
the
besetting
sin
of
cartwright
and
while
the
embrace
yet
lasted
he
stretched
his
arm
to
the
bell
the
summons
was
answered
and
the
cab
despatched
for
the
lawyer
with
a
celerity
that
did
much
credit
to
the
establishment
when
corbold
arrived
he
was
received
by
his
cousin
in
the
library
which
in
conformity
to
the
resolution
announced
long
ago
to
charles
mowbray
was
preserved
religiously
for
his
own
use
and
comfort
and
a
few
minutes
short
but
pithy
conversation
sufficed
to
put
the
serious
attorney
of
what
was
expected
of
him
you
know
cousin
stephen
said
the
vicar
of
wrexhill
that
the
lord
is
about
to
bless
my
house
with
increase
and
it
is
partly
on
this
account
and
partly
for
the
purpose
of
making
a
suitable
provision
for
me
in
case
of
her
death
which
may
he
long
delay
i
am
sure
cousin
cartwright
there
is
no
work
that
i
could
set
about
with
greater
readiness
and
pleasure
shall
i
receive
my
instructions
from
you
cousin
at
this
present
time
and
the
zealous
corbold
accompanied
the
question
by
an
action
very
germain
to
it
namely
the
pulling
forth
from
a
long
a
portion
of
tied
round
with
red
tape
by
no
means
cousin
stephen
replied
the
vicar
of
wrexhill
it
is
from
my
beloved
wife
herself
that
i
wish
you
to
receive
your
instructions
of
course
what
you
do
can
only
be
preparatory
to
the
engrossing
it
on
parchment
and
though
from
delicacy
i
will
not
be
present
during
your
interview
with
her
yet
before
the
document
be
finally
signed
sealed
and
delivered
i
shall
naturally
wish
to
glance
my
eye
over
it
there
is
no
longer
therefore
any
occasion
to
delay
come
with
me
cousin
stephen
to
my
dear
wife
and
may
heaven
bless
to
you
and
to
me
the
fruits
of
this
day
labour
the
master
of
the
house
then
preceded
the
serious
but
admiring
attorney
through
the
stately
hall
and
up
the
stately
staircase
and
into
the
beautiful
little
apartment
where
cartwright
with
a
very
pensive
expression
of
countenance
sat
ready
to
receive
them
oh
corbold
she
said
kindly
extending
her
hand
to
him
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
but
my
joy
is
dashed
with
remorse
when
i
remember
the
thoughtless
folly
with
which
i
have
so
long
delayed
this
necessary
my
dearest
cartwright
she
continued
turning
to
her
husband
can
you
forgive
me
for
this
perhaps
dearest
you
can
for
your
soul
is
all
generosity
but
i
shall
never
forgive
myself
my
only
excuse
rests
in
my
ignorance
i
believed
that
the
law
gave
as
i
am
sure
it
ought
to
do
and
as
in
fact
it
did
in
the
case
of
my
first
marriage
every
thing
that
belongs
to
me
to
my
husband
it
is
true
that
i
only
brought
my
first
husband
about
three
hundred
thousand
pounds
in
money
and
most
of
it
has
been
since
very
profitably
converted
into
land
perhaps
corbold
it
is
this
which
makes
the
difference
corbold
assured
her
that
she
was
perfectly
right
not
considering
himself
as
called
upon
at
the
present
moment
to
allude
to
the
accident
of
her
having
children
now
then
my
beloved
clara
i
leave
you
said
cartwright
not
for
worlds
would
i
suffer
my
presence
to
influence
you
even
by
a
look
in
the
disposition
of
property
so
entirely
your
own
this
generous
delicacy
my
beloved
husband
is
worthy
of
you
i
shall
i
own
prefer
being
left
on
this
occasion
with
our
pious
kinsman
and
friend
the
vicar
kissed
his
lady
delicate
fingers
and
departed
heaven
has
been
exceeding
gracious
to
me
corbold
it
must
be
seldom
i
fear
that
in
your
profession
you
meet
with
so
and
exemplary
a
character
as
that
of
your
cousin
ah
my
dear
sir
how
can
i
be
thankful
enough
for
so
great
mercy
the
lord
hath
rewarded
his
handmaiden
replied
the
serious
attorney
you
have
deserved
happiness
excellent
lady
and
you
have
it
corbold
now
again
pulled
out
his
and
with
an
air
of
much
deference
placed
himself
opposite
to
cartwright
i
presume
you
have
ink
and
pens
at
hand
my
honoured
lady
take
my
keys
corbold
in
that
desk
you
will
find
every
thing
you
want
for
writing
and
in
the
drawer
of
it
is
the
copy
of
my
late
husband
will
it
is
this
that
i
mean
to
make
the
model
of
my
own
he
set
me
an
example
of
generous
confidence
corbold
and
i
can
not
i
think
do
better
than
follow
it
cartwright
drew
the
desk
towards
her
and
from
the
drawer
of
it
took
the
instrument
which
had
made
her
mistress
not
only
of
all
the
property
she
had
originally
brought
her
husband
but
also
of
an
estate
which
had
come
to
him
after
his
marriage
this
deed
sir
she
said
putting
the
parchment
in
hands
will
i
hope
supersede
the
necessity
of
instructions
from
me
i
am
a
very
poor
lawyer
corbold
and
i
think
it
very
probable
that
were
you
to
write
after
my
dictation
my
will
might
turn
out
to
be
something
very
different
from
what
i
wish
to
make
it
but
if
you
take
this
as
your
model
it
can
not
fail
to
be
right
as
by
this
instrument
i
have
been
made
to
stand
exactly
in
the
position
in
which
i
now
wish
to
place
my
exemplary
husband
mr
cartwright
if
such
be
your
wish
dearest
lady
said
the
attorney
i
will
with
your
permission
take
this
parchment
with
me
and
by
so
doing
i
shall
not
only
avoid
the
necessity
of
troubling
you
but
by
the
blessing
of
heaven
upon
my
humble
endeavours
i
shall
be
enabled
accurately
to
prepare
precisely
such
a
document
as
it
appears
to
be
your
wish
to
sign
in
these
matters
no
instructions
can
make
us
such
plain
sailing
my
dear
madam
as
the
having
a
satisfactory
precedent
in
our
ah
dearest
lady
when
i
witness
the
conjugal
happiness
of
yourself
and
my
cousin
my
heart
sinks
within
me
as
i
remember
that
equal
felicity
would
be
my
own
were
it
not
for
the
cruel
interference
of
one
to
whom
i
have
never
done
an
injury
and
for
whom
i
would
willingly
show
if
he
would
let
me
all
a
brother
love
keep
up
your
spirits
my
good
cousin
replied
the
lady
if
helen
favours
your
suit
and
on
this
point
you
must
be
a
better
judge
than
i
charles
opposition
will
not
long
avail
to
impede
your
union
the
lover
sighed
raised
his
eyes
to
heaven
and
probably
not
very
well
knowing
what
to
say
departed
without
replying
a
word
as
he
reached
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
he
perceived
his
cousin
standing
within
the
door
of
his
library
which
he
held
ajar
he
put
out
his
hand
and
beckoned
him
in
you
have
made
quick
work
of
it
cousin
stephen
said
the
anxious
vicar
i
trust
you
have
not
hurried
away
without
fully
understanding
my
dear
wife
wishes
i
ask
no
questions
cousin
corbold
and
do
not
i
beseech
you
imagine
that
i
wish
you
to
betray
any
trust
merely
tell
me
if
my
dear
cartwright
appears
to
be
easier
in
her
mind
now
that
she
has
disclosed
her
intentions
to
you
the
best
and
soberest
minded
men
are
sometimes
assailed
by
temptation
of
which
painful
fact
stephen
corbold
at
that
moment
became
proof
some
merry
devil
prompted
him
to
affect
the
belief
that
his
reverend
cousin
was
in
earnest
and
putting
on
a
sanctified
look
of
decorum
he
replied
of
course
cousin
cartwright
i
know
you
too
well
to
believe
that
you
would
wish
to
meddle
or
make
with
such
an
instrument
as
this
when
your
excellent
and
i
doubt
not
lady
shall
be
defunct
you
will
in
the
course
of
law
be
made
acquainted
with
her
will
i
rejoice
to
tell
you
that
her
mind
seems
now
to
be
perfectly
unburdened
and
clear
from
all
worldly
anxieties
whatever
as
the
attorney
ended
these
words
he
raised
his
eyes
which
were
fixed
as
he
spoke
upon
the
roll
of
parchment
which
he
held
in
his
hand
and
caught
fixed
full
upon
him
such
a
broadside
of
rage
from
the
large
and
really
very
expressive
eyes
of
his
cousin
that
he
actually
trembled
from
top
to
toe
and
heartily
repenting
him
of
the
temerity
which
led
him
to
hazard
so
dangerous
a
jest
he
quietly
sat
down
at
a
table
and
spreading
open
the
parchment
upon
it
added
but
although
it
would
be
altogether
foreign
to
your
noble
nature
cousin
cartwright
to
express
or
indeed
to
feel
any
thing
like
curiosity
on
the
subject
it
would
be
equally
foreign
to
mine
not
to
open
my
heart
to
you
with
all
the
frankness
that
our
near
kindred
demands
do
not
then
refuse
dear
cousin
to
share
with
me
the
pleasure
i
feel
in
knowing
that
heaven
has
taken
care
of
its
own
the
only
instruction
i
have
received
from
your
pious
and
exemplary
wife
cousin
cartwright
was
to
draw
her
will
exactly
on
the
model
of
this
which
as
you
may
perceive
is
a
copy
of
the
one
under
which
she
herself
was
put
into
the
possession
of
the
splendid
fortunes
of
which
by
especial
providence
you
have
already
the
control
and
of
which
should
it
please
the
merciful
disposer
of
all
things
so
to
order
it
that
this
lady
really
fitter
for
heaven
than
earth
should
be
taken
to
abraham
bosom
before
you
you
will
become
the
sole
owner
and
possessor
you
and
your
heirs
for
ever
cartwright
had
in
general
great
command
over
himself
rarely
betraying
any
feeling
which
he
wished
to
conceal
perhaps
even
the
anger
which
gleamed
in
his
eye
a
few
moments
before
and
which
had
now
given
place
to
a
placidity
that
would
by
every
serious
lady
in
england
have
been
denominated
heavenly
perhaps
even
this
though
it
seemed
to
dart
forth
involuntarily
was
in
truth
permitted
to
appear
as
being
a
more
safe
and
desirable
mode
of
obtaining
his
object
than
the
collaring
his
cousin
and
saying
refuse
to
let
me
see
that
paper
and
i
murder
you
but
no
object
was
now
to
be
obtained
by
permitting
his
looks
to
express
his
feelings
and
therefore
though
he
felt
his
heart
spring
within
him
in
a
spasm
of
joy
and
triumph
he
looked
as
quiet
and
unmoved
as
if
nothing
extraordinary
had
happened
it
is
very
well
cousin
stephen
he
said
make
not
any
unnecessary
delay
in
the
preparing
of
this
deed
life
is
very
uncertain
and
moreover
the
time
is
known
to
no
man
wherefore
let
this
thing
be
done
immediately
could
i
see
miss
helen
for
a
moment
alone
if
i
got
this
completed
signed
sealed
and
delivered
by
night
said
the
attorney
yes
my
good
cousin
yes
i
pledge
you
my
word
for
it
in
justice
to
the
character
of
the
unfortunate
mowbray
it
is
but
fair
to
remark
that
notwithstanding
the
ceaseless
process
by
which
from
the
very
first
hour
of
their
acquaintance
the
vicar
of
wrexhill
had
sought
to
estrange
her
from
her
children
he
never
ceased
to
speak
of
charles
as
her
undoubted
heir
and
of
helen
and
fanny
as
young
ladies
of
large
fortune
the
lamentable
infatuation
therefore
which
induced
her
to
put
every
thing
in
his
power
went
not
the
length
of
intending
to
leave
her
children
destitute
though
it
led
her
very
sincerely
to
believe
that
the
power
thus
weakly
given
would
be
properly
and
as
she
would
have
said
poor
woman
religiously
exercised
for
their
advantage
chapter
viii
the
among
the
many
comforts
and
privileges
which
cartwright
exclusive
possession
of
the
library
afforded
him
that
of
receiving
in
solitary
state
and
privacy
the
family
was
not
the
one
least
valued
it
may
i
believe
be
laid
down
as
a
pretty
general
rule
that
those
persons
who
conceive
or
profess
it
to
be
their
duty
to
dive
into
the
hearts
and
consciences
of
their
and
to
regulate
the
very
thoughts
and
feelings
of
all
the
unfortunate
people
within
their
reach
are
not
very
scrupulous
as
to
the
methods
used
to
obtain
that
knowledge
cartwright
according
to
the
usual
custom
of
divines
of
his
class
had
his
village
matron
ostensibly
only
a
merchant
of
apples
gingerbread
and
lollypops
but
intrusted
with
as
many
secret
missions
of
inquiry
as
the
most
jealous
pontiff
ever
committed
to
a
faithful
and
favoured
nuncio
on
quitting
the
gates
of
rome
she
could
tell
and
was
not
ill
paid
for
that
precious
knowledge
how
often
betty
jackson
went
to
buy
baccy
and
how
many
times
in
the
day
sally
wright
looked
over
her
shoulder
at
the
while
walking
out
with
her
master
children
and
how
many
pots
of
porter
were
carried
to
one
house
and
how
many
times
the
ladies
walked
forth
from
another
besides
innumerable
other
facts
and
anecdotes
which
though
apparently
not
of
sufficient
importance
to
record
were
nevertheless
of
great
value
to
the
vicar
and
to
his
curate
as
themes
to
lecture
upon
in
private
and
preach
upon
in
public
sources
of
information
such
as
these
had
never
been
overlooked
or
neglected
by
cartwright
at
any
period
of
his
ministry
but
hitherto
he
had
held
them
to
be
important
rather
to
the
general
welfare
of
the
christian
world
than
to
his
own
family
no
sooner
however
did
he
find
himself
placed
in
the
responsible
position
of
master
of
a
large
household
than
besides
taking
the
butler
into
a
sort
of
partnership
for
the
discovery
of
petty
offences
and
having
moreover
an
elected
who
made
a
daily
report
of
all
that
he
saw
and
heard
and
a
little
more
he
determined
that
all
letters
addressed
to
any
member
of
the
family
should
pass
through
his
hand
and
in
like
manner
that
all
those
put
into
the
in
the
hall
of
which
he
kept
the
key
himself
should
be
submitted
to
the
same
species
of
religious
examination
before
they
were
deposited
in
the
in
the
execution
of
this
part
of
his
duty
cartwright
displayed
to
himself
at
least
considerable
mechanical
skill
for
the
letters
were
excellently
well
and
likewise
great
equanimity
of
temper
for
scanty
as
the
family
correspondence
proved
to
be
he
chanced
to
fall
upon
some
few
passages
which
might
have
shaken
the
philosophy
of
a
mind
less
admirably
regulated
in
former
times
if
any
mowbray
had
wished
to
send
a
note
from
the
park
to
the
village
a
groom
or
a
groom
helper
would
have
taken
it
but
now
though
the
establishment
was
greatly
increased
there
was
no
such
privilege
allowed
them
and
in
order
to
escape
the
ceremony
of
asking
permission
to
employ
a
servant
they
all
resorted
to
the
one
of
the
letters
thus
sent
and
thus
examined
was
from
little
mary
richards
to
her
friend
fanny
and
many
more
important
documents
had
passed
through
his
hands
without
exciting
an
equal
degree
of
emotion
it
ran
thus
i
can
not
express
to
you
my
dearest
fanny
how
anxious
i
feel
to
open
my
whole
heart
to
you
on
a
subject
that
has
long
occupied
us
both
with
i
believe
equal
depth
and
sincerity
of
interest
i
mean
as
i
am
sure
you
will
instantly
anticipate
that
inward
call
to
especial
grace
and
favour
which
cartwright
taught
us
to
expect
would
be
the
sure
and
certain
consequence
of
unbounded
faith
in
for
so
only
can
we
interpret
the
language
he
used
to
us
if
i
were
to
live
a
thousand
years
dear
fanny
i
should
never
cease
to
regret
the
dreadful
but
i
thank
heaven
brief
interval
during
which
i
firmly
believed
that
i
had
received
this
call
while
this
frightful
and
most
presumptuous
notion
had
possession
of
me
i
looked
upon
my
dear
and
excellent
mother
ay
and
to
my
bitter
sorrow
treated
her
too
as
a
being
almost
unworthy
of
communion
with
me
is
not
this
of
itself
enough
to
prove
the
unholy
tendency
of
the
doctrine
now
that
the
madness
is
passed
i
look
back
upon
it
with
as
much
astonishment
as
sorrow
and
can
so
clearly
trace
in
it
the
workings
of
the
most
paltry
vanity
and
egregious
that
while
remembering
how
sincerely
i
believed
myself
for
all
the
hateful
crimes
of
impious
presumption
and
filial
ingratitude
of
which
i
was
guilty
i
can
not
but
think
that
the
most
contemptible
follies
into
which
vanity
and
fine
speeches
ever
plunged
a
girl
in
the
ordinary
routine
of
this
world
nonsense
must
be
considered
as
innocent
and
respectable
when
compared
to
those
committed
oh
fearful
impiety
in
the
name
of
heaven
though
we
frequently
meet
i
have
never
yet
been
able
fully
and
clearly
to
state
to
you
how
completely
i
have
made
a
recantation
of
all
my
religious
errors
it
is
singular
how
cartwright
contrives
either
by
himself
or
his
satellites
to
be
always
hovering
near
us
for
the
three
last
wednesdays
i
have
set
off
for
the
park
with
a
firm
determination
to
speak
to
you
on
this
subject
but
i
have
each
time
found
it
impossible
i
believe
that
my
countenance
or
manner
must
have
expressed
some
part
of
the
anxiety
i
felt
to
converse
with
you
and
that
my
eagerness
to
obtain
my
object
defeated
it
on
one
occasion
as
i
think
you
must
remember
cartwright
himself
though
constantly
drawn
here
and
there
to
perform
his
gracious
hospitalities
to
the
rest
of
the
company
ceased
not
again
and
again
to
return
with
his
soft
well
dear
children
what
are
you
talking
about
on
another
it
was
his
curate
and
deputy
who
performed
the
office
of
interrupter
and
last
wednesday
that
very
unaccountable
person
jacob
seemed
determined
that
no
one
should
speak
to
you
but
himself
i
have
therefore
dearest
fanny
determined
to
write
to
you
i
think
it
likely
that
i
may
soon
leave
this
neighbourhood
major
dalrymple
who
has
been
greatly
the
means
of
bringing
me
back
to
happiness
and
common
sense
will
i
believe
undertake
the
charge
of
me
for
the
rest
of
my
life
this
i
find
has
long
been
my
dear
dear
mother
wish
had
i
been
quite
sure
of
this
a
year
ago
i
think
i
should
have
been
saved
this
wild
interlude
of
fanatic
raving
however
it
is
over
and
greatly
as
i
have
been
the
worse
i
hope
and
believe
that
for
the
future
i
shall
be
the
humbler
christian
and
the
better
woman
for
it
major
dalrymple
is
at
present
in
scotland
attending
the
sick
i
believe
the
dying
hours
of
his
cousin
lord
hilton
after
his
return
it
is
probable
we
shall
leave
wrexhill
and
i
am
therefore
most
anxious
to
make
you
acquainted
with
my
present
state
of
mind
for
i
can
not
but
suspect
that
we
have
run
the
farther
into
this
lamentable
folly
because
we
ran
together
you
have
already
said
enough
to
make
me
hope
that
you
too
are
recovering
from
your
delusion
but
i
can
not
be
easy
without
telling
you
explicitly
that
i
am
again
the
same
unpretending
little
christian
that
i
was
in
the
days
of
our
good
wallace
that
i
am
once
more
a
loving
and
dutiful
daughter
to
the
best
of
mothers
and
ever
and
always
your
very
affectionate
friend
mary
richards
pray
let
me
hear
from
you
this
letter
was
wormwood
to
cartwright
from
one
end
to
the
other
had
it
rehearsed
the
kissing
story
he
would
liked
it
infinitely
better
he
was
quite
aware
of
mary
richards
falling
off
and
attributed
it
as
well
as
that
equally
evident
in
fanny
to
jealousy
woman
jealousy
and
drew
thence
a
species
of
gratification
that
almost
atoned
for
their
secession
the
more
so
perhaps
as
the
business
of
the
will
rendered
it
absolutely
necessary
that
cost
what
converts
it
might
he
should
bestow
his
wholly
and
solely
upon
his
lady
but
to
find
that
this
pretty
little
girl
really
appeared
to
have
forgotten
the
kiss
altogether
and
yet
that
she
had
escaped
from
his
net
at
the
very
moment
too
when
as
it
seemed
she
was
on
the
very
verge
of
becoming
a
viscountess
was
a
mortification
so
cutting
that
he
actually
ground
his
fine
teeth
together
with
rage
at
it
his
first
impulse
was
to
destroy
it
but
he
recollected
that
by
suffering
it
to
reach
fanny
he
should
obtain
a
sight
of
her
answer
and
feeling
considerable
curiosity
to
discover
how
he
should
fare
in
the
hands
of
the
little
melancholy
poetess
who
had
of
late
evidently
avoided
all
communication
with
him
he
carefully
it
and
sedulously
pinching
its
folds
into
flatness
put
it
aside
to
be
delivered
according
to
its
address
the
event
proved
that
he
was
quite
right
in
believing
that
fanny
mowbray
would
answer
this
letter
but
whether
the
perusal
of
her
reply
increased
his
satisfaction
in
being
master
of
cartwright
park
may
be
doubted
fanny
reply
was
as
follows
my
very
dear
mary
i
am
most
thankful
to
have
received
your
letter
for
one
source
of
the
mental
misery
i
have
endured
has
arisen
from
believing
that
i
first
led
you
to
fix
your
attention
on
cartwright
and
your
faith
on
the
hateful
dogmas
he
taught
you
are
freed
you
have
escaped
you
are
restored
to
the
mother
you
love
and
will
be
happy
i
thank
heaven
mary
that
my
heart
is
not
wholly
perverted
by
all
the
unnatural
struggles
it
has
gone
through
for
i
do
rejoice
my
dear
friend
at
your
felicity
with
a
pureness
and
freshness
of
joy
that
i
have
never
felt
at
any
thing
since
the
death
of
my
poor
father
came
and
blighted
all
our
joys
neither
am
i
surprised
at
the
end
of
your
history
may
you
through
life
be
as
happy
as
i
wish
you
and
you
shall
have
no
reason
to
complain
of
myself
i
know
not
how
to
speak
and
yet
i
am
sure
that
you
will
not
be
easy
without
knowing
something
of
the
present
state
of
my
mind
yes
mary
the
mad
fanaticism
has
passed
away
but
it
has
left
me
weak
as
a
child
recovered
from
the
delirium
of
a
raging
fever
and
i
feel
very
doubtful
if
i
shall
ever
wholly
recover
it
i
am
thankful
that
you
have
suffered
less
than
i
have
done
indeed
the
mischief
wrought
so
differently
with
you
that
i
almost
doubt
my
power
of
making
you
understand
all
i
have
suffered
i
can
not
explain
even
to
myself
what
species
of
feeling
it
was
which
took
possession
of
me
when
first
i
became
acquainted
with
cartwright
of
this
however
i
am
quite
sure
that
i
believed
with
all
the
simplicity
of
truth
and
innocence
that
all
i
felt
proceeded
from
the
immediate
influence
of
the
deity
working
within
me
to
secure
my
eternal
salvation
i
could
not
more
firmly
have
believed
that
cartwright
was
heaven
appointed
agent
on
earth
and
every
thing
he
did
and
every
thing
he
said
appeared
clothed
in
a
sort
of
holiness
in
my
eyes
which
would
have
rendered
it
impious
to
judge
him
as
another
would
have
been
judged
during
the
first
two
or
three
months
of
our
acquaintance
i
was
happy
oh
much
more
than
happy
i
lived
in
a
sort
of
ecstasy
i
believed
myself
the
chosen
of
heaven
and
that
all
the
agitating
but
delightful
emotions
which
cartwright
admiration
and
praises
excited
were
only
so
many
heavenly
assurances
that
i
was
indeed
one
of
the
elected
few
predestined
to
eternal
and
unspeakable
happiness
he
caressed
me
very
often
he
caressed
me
but
even
now
mary
that
i
see
clearly
much
that
was
then
concealed
i
can
not
comprehend
the
sort
of
effect
this
had
upon
me
i
think
that
had
he
asked
me
to
marry
him
i
should
have
been
conscious
of
the
disparity
of
his
age
and
i
think
too
that
i
should
have
been
startled
and
shocked
at
discovering
that
his
love
always
so
fervently
expressed
and
often
shown
by
tender
endearments
was
in
anyway
an
earthly
love
and
yet
weak
and
inconsistent
creatures
that
we
are
when
i
discovered
that
the
object
of
my
mother
last
sudden
journey
to
town
in
which
i
accompanied
her
when
i
discovered
that
her
purpose
was
to
marry
cartwright
the
sick
faintness
that
seemed
to
seize
upon
my
heart
and
creep
over
all
my
limbs
convinced
me
for
a
moment
that
i
loved
him
not
as
i
fancied
i
did
dear
mary
as
a
lower
angel
might
love
one
of
higher
order
but
with
a
love
of
a
weak
sinful
woman
the
tortures
i
endured
that
night
can
never
be
obliterated
from
my
mind
a
terrified
conscience
and
a
wounded
heart
seemed
struggling
together
as
if
to
try
which
could
torment
me
most
but
the
struggle
did
not
last
long
my
heart
at
least
all
that
was
tender
and
womanly
in
it
appeared
to
turn
to
stone
and
was
tranquil
enough
as
far
as
any
feelings
connected
with
love
for
cartwright
were
concerned
but
religious
terrors
frightful
hideous
almost
maddening
took
possession
of
me
i
believed
that
the
crime
i
had
committed
in
loving
the
man
whom
heaven
had
ordained
to
be
my
spiritual
teacher
was
a
deadly
sin
i
now
felt
certain
or
in
the
language
of
the
sect
an
inward
assurance
that
i
was
to
eternal
perdition
and
that
the
belief
i
had
once
entertained
exactly
contrary
to
this
was
of
itself
a
sin
never
to
be
atoned
and
only
to
be
punished
by
eternal
flames
is
there
another
torture
of
the
mind
equal
to
this
i
do
not
think
it
for
true
and
reasonable
remorse
for
crimes
really
committed
can
not
approach
it
not
all
the
sins
that
man
ever
laid
upon
his
soul
could
equal
in
atrocity
what
my
guilt
seemed
to
me
i
suppose
i
was
mad
quite
mad
for
as
i
now
recall
the
hours
that
passed
over
me
and
all
the
horrid
images
of
the
avenging
fury
of
an
angry
god
which
entered
and
rested
upon
my
spirit
i
can
call
the
state
i
was
in
nothing
short
of
madness
this
state
lasted
with
little
variation
in
the
amount
of
suffering
during
the
first
week
after
my
mother
marriage
and
then
its
feverish
violence
gave
place
to
sullen
heavy
gloom
the
cure
however
was
near
very
near
me
for
i
found
it
in
cartwright
himself
it
was
some
trifling
instance
of
contemptible
artifice
which
first
drew
aside
the
veil
from
my
mental
vision
and
caused
me
to
see
cartwright
not
as
he
is
oh
no
that
has
been
a
work
of
steady
study
and
some
length
of
time
but
as
something
of
a
very
different
species
from
that
to
which
i
had
fancied
he
belonged
one
must
have
been
under
a
delusion
as
complete
as
mine
has
been
to
conceive
the
sensation
produced
by
once
more
seeing
things
as
they
are
i
can
compare
it
only
to
walking
out
of
a
region
peopled
with
phantoms
and
shadows
into
a
world
filled
with
sober
solid
realities
it
is
the
phantom
world
which
produces
the
strongest
effect
on
the
imagination
and
the
first
effect
of
the
change
was
to
make
everything
around
me
seem
most
earthly
dull
stale
and
unprofitable
i
was
still
however
a
fanatic
i
still
deemed
myself
one
of
those
foredoomed
to
eternal
destruction
but
one
blessed
day
some
time
after
i
had
become
convinced
that
cartwright
was
a
very
pitiful
scoundrel
i
chanced
to
hear
him
in
sweet
and
solemn
accents
expound
his
scheme
of
providence
to
one
of
our
distant
neighbours
who
came
here
to
pass
the
morning
and
who
seemed
well
disposed
to
listen
to
him
i
saw
that
every
word
he
said
rendered
soothing
and
attractive
by
the
gentle
kindness
of
his
manner
and
the
eloquent
commentary
of
his
eyes
was
making
its
way
to
the
poor
lady
soul
just
as
a
year
before
the
selfsame
words
and
looks
had
worked
their
way
to
mine
it
was
at
that
moment
i
felt
the
first
doubts
of
the
truth
of
the
doctrine
i
had
imbibed
from
him
for
himself
i
had
long
felt
the
most
profound
contempt
but
i
had
hitherto
shrunk
from
the
impiety
of
confounding
the
doctrine
and
the
teacher
something
artificial
and
forced
in
his
manner
recalled
by
the
force
of
contrast
the
voice
and
look
of
our
dear
wallace
and
then
came
the
bold
but
blessed
thought
that
the
awful
dogmas
by
which
he
had
kept
my
soul
in
thrall
might
be
as
false
and
worthless
as
himself
my
recovery
from
my
mental
malady
may
be
dated
from
that
hour
every
day
that
has
passed
since
has
led
me
back
nearer
and
nearer
i
hope
to
the
happy
state
of
religious
feeling
at
least
in
which
cartwright
found
me
but
the
more
fully
i
recover
my
senses
the
more
fully
i
become
aware
of
the
sad
change
he
has
wrought
in
every
thing
else
not
only
do
we
all
creep
like
permitted
slaves
through
the
house
that
we
once
felt
to
be
our
own
but
he
has
stolen
our
mother
from
us
poor
poor
mamma
how
dearly
did
she
love
us
how
dearly
did
we
love
her
where
is
the
feeling
gone
she
has
never
quarrelled
with
us
with
me
particularly
she
has
never
expressed
herself
displeased
in
any
way
and
yet
her
love
seems
blighted
and
dried
up
as
if
some
poisonous
breath
had
blasted
it
and
so
it
has
placid
and
fair
as
is
the
outward
seeming
of
this
hateful
man
i
question
not
but
every
hour
brings
forth
some
sorry
trick
to
draw
her
farther
from
us
poor
poor
mamma
i
know
this
can
not
last
and
when
she
finds
him
out
how
dreadful
will
her
feelings
be
then
too
i
have
another
sorrow
my
dear
mary
which
tarnishes
though
it
can
not
destroy
the
joy
of
my
return
to
reason
while
the
fit
lasted
i
believed
it
a
part
of
my
dark
duty
to
keep
helen
and
rosalind
and
our
poor
exiled
charles
as
much
at
a
distance
from
me
as
possible
and
now
i
hardly
dare
to
hope
that
this
can
ever
be
quite
forgotten
by
them
i
have
not
courage
to
enter
with
them
into
an
explanation
as
full
as
this
which
i
have
now
given
you
yet
till
i
do
this
i
can
not
hope
that
they
will
either
understand
or
forgive
me
if
charles
were
at
home
i
think
the
task
would
be
easier
but
rosalind
and
helen
both
seem
to
avoid
me
i
believe
they
are
too
miserable
themselves
to
look
much
at
me
or
they
might
see
that
i
no
longer
turned
from
them
as
i
did
some
months
ago
all
this
however
may
some
day
or
other
come
right
again
but
what
is
to
become
of
poor
charles
i
feel
convinced
this
hypocrite
will
never
rest
till
he
has
robbed
him
of
his
inheritance
and
i
sometimes
think
that
as
the
doing
this
must
be
the
act
of
my
mother
it
would
be
right
in
me
to
put
her
on
her
guard
against
his
machinations
but
this
can
only
be
done
by
opening
her
eyes
to
his
real
character
and
though
i
think
i
could
do
this
i
tremble
at
the
misery
into
which
it
would
plunge
but
this
is
going
beyond
your
request
dear
mary
you
can
not
be
ignorant
that
my
unhappy
mother
marriage
has
plunged
us
all
in
misery
and
there
is
little
kindness
in
impressing
this
truth
upon
you
when
your
own
bright
prospects
ought
to
occupy
you
with
pleasant
thoughts
of
future
happiness
forgive
me
and
believe
me
with
every
wish
that
this
happiness
may
be
as
great
and
as
lasting
as
the
nature
of
human
life
can
permit
your
ever
affectionate
friend
fanny
mowbray
some
people
might
have
found
the
perusal
of
these
letters
sufficient
to
damp
the
ardour
of
their
curiosity
in
the
pursuit
of
private
information
but
it
had
not
this
effect
upon
cartwright
he
even
doubted
whether
he
should
not
suffer
this
letter
of
fanny
to
reach
its
destination
for
the
same
reason
that
he
had
permitted
that
of
her
friend
to
reach
hers
namely
the
procuring
a
reply
but
upon
a
for
he
gave
himself
the
gratification
of
reading
it
twice
he
tore
it
into
tiny
atoms
and
then
lighted
a
bougie
to
set
fire
to
the
fragments
the
next
letter
of
any
importance
which
fell
into
his
hands
by
the
same
means
must
also
be
given
to
the
reader
as
it
contains
some
important
information
which
as
it
immediately
shared
the
same
fate
as
that
of
fanny
remained
for
a
considerable
time
unknown
to
the
person
it
most
concerned
as
well
as
to
all
others
this
letter
was
addressed
to
helen
from
one
whom
beyond
all
others
in
the
wide
world
it
would
best
have
pleased
her
to
receive
any
token
of
remembrance
or
attention
it
came
from
colonel
harrington
and
contained
the
following
lines
were
miss
mowbray
placed
in
other
circumstances
were
not
all
proper
access
to
her
barred
by
the
hateful
influence
of
an
alien
and
a
stranger
to
her
and
to
her
blood
i
should
not
thus
venture
to
address
her
all
application
to
your
mother
and
natural
guardian
would
be
we
know
but
too
well
in
vain
nay
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
any
application
to
yourself
through
her
would
never
be
permitted
to
reach
you
but
rascal
as
this
cartwright
has
proved
himself
i
presume
he
does
not
tamper
with
the
post
and
it
is
therefore
by
this
vulgar
and
ordinary
medium
that
i
determine
to
make
known
to
you
what
it
is
great
misery
to
conceal
yet
after
all
in
saying
i
love
i
think
i
say
nothing
that
you
do
not
know
already
but
nevertheless
it
is
delightful
to
say
it
and
were
i
sweet
helen
once
more
within
reach
of
being
heard
by
you
i
might
perchance
weary
you
with
the
repetition
of
it
but
this
is
not
all
i
have
to
say
though
it
is
only
in
the
supposition
of
your
listening
to
this
without
anger
that
i
dare
proceed
i
believe
helen
i
ought
to
say
something
a
great
deal
perhaps
about
my
presumption
and
my
fears
and
i
know
not
what
beside
but
the
simple
truth
is
that
being
quite
conscious
i
loved
you
and
not
feeling
the
least
reason
or
wish
to
conceal
it
my
manner
and
words
too
i
believe
must
have
let
you
into
the
secret
the
last
time
we
met
and
those
dear
eyes
with
their
long
eyelashes
so
constantly
as
they
are
before
me
would
long
ago
have
looked
me
into
despair
if
the
memory
of
one
soft
glance
at
parting
had
not
permitted
me
to
hope
my
father
and
mother
helen
know
that
i
love
you
and
that
all
my
future
happiness
hangs
on
your
consenting
to
become
my
wife
without
your
mother
why
should
i
conceal
from
you
that
i
know
it
will
be
refused
why
should
i
not
frankly
and
fairly
tell
you
at
once
my
beloved
helen
that
something
very
like
an
elopement
must
be
resorted
to
before
you
can
be
mine
but
what
an
elopement
it
will
only
be
to
the
house
of
your
godmother
who
already
loves
you
as
her
child
and
who
not
only
sanctions
my
addressing
you
but
has
commissioned
me
to
say
that
she
shall
never
know
any
thing
approaching
happiness
till
she
can
take
you
in
her
arms
and
call
you
her
real
daughter
and
her
william
wife
for
my
father
you
know
his
oddities
he
declares
that
if
you
will
come
to
oakley
and
frankly
consent
to
be
his
daughter
it
will
be
the
happiest
moment
of
his
life
when
he
puts
your
hand
in
mine
and
calls
you
so
but
he
swears
lustily
helen
that
no
application
to
your
mother
shall
ever
be
made
with
his
consent
this
is
rough
wooing
sweet
one
but
do
i
overrate
the
generosity
of
your
temper
when
i
express
my
belief
that
you
will
not
suffer
what
is
inevitable
to
destroy
hopes
that
smile
so
sweetly
on
us
address
your
answer
to
oakley
helen
write
it
if
you
will
to
my
mother
dear
and
precious
as
one
little
line
of
kindness
would
be
to
me
i
will
not
ask
it
if
your
proud
heart
would
find
it
easier
to
open
itself
to
her
than
to
me
but
keep
me
not
long
in
suspense
before
i
shall
have
sealed
my
letter
i
shall
feel
sick
because
the
answer
to
it
is
not
come
my
regiment
is
not
going
abroad
this
change
in
its
destination
was
only
known
to
us
on
friday
farewell
how
wholly
does
my
fate
hang
upon
your
answer
ever
ever
yours
william
harrington
the
destruction
of
this
letter
was
attended
with
a
feeling
of
pleasure
greatly
superior
both
in
quality
and
extent
to
that
which
he
received
from
watching
spark
after
spark
die
away
from
the
fading
embers
of
poor
fanny
long
epistle
that
was
merely
a
matter
of
mawkish
sentiment
this
was
an
affair
of
business
but
miss
helen
shall
have
a
lover
nevertheless
it
was
thus
he
ended
his
cogitation
my
cousin
stephen
will
not
fail
me
this
evening
he
will
be
here
with
what
will
make
the
young
lady
hand
worth
just
as
much
as
i
please
and
no
more
and
if
my
worthy
cousin
likes
her
he
shall
have
her
and
as
he
thought
these
words
a
smile
curled
his
lips
and
he
playfully
blackened
the
paper
and
singed
it
and
finally
set
it
in
a
blaze
uttering
aloud
as
the
flame
expired
a
of
dragoons
the
vicar
of
wrexhill
chapter
ix
the
will
executed
the
evening
was
pretty
far
advanced
when
at
length
the
bell
was
loudly
rung
and
immediately
afterwards
stephen
corbold
entered
the
looking
more
assured
and
as
helen
thought
more
detestable
than
ever
having
deliberately
sipped
his
tea
and
indulged
himself
the
while
in
a
long
steady
stare
in
the
face
of
the
unfortunate
object
of
his
passion
he
at
length
rose
and
with
an
air
of
much
confidential
importance
raising
himself
on
his
toes
and
playing
with
his
approached
cartwright
and
whispered
something
in
her
ear
have
the
kindness
to
ring
the
bell
hetherington
said
the
lady
addressing
the
curate
who
according
to
his
frequent
custom
had
taken
his
tea
at
the
park
partly
for
the
advantage
of
receiving
the
instructions
of
his
principal
upon
sundry
little
points
of
church
and
village
discipline
and
partly
for
the
hope
of
finding
some
one
among
the
young
ladies
less
cruel
than
the
inexorable
henrietta
who
had
never
appeared
to
see
him
from
the
moment
they
parted
in
the
shrubbery
tell
curtis
to
carry
lights
to
my
said
cartwright
to
the
servant
who
answered
the
bell
the
vicar
heart
gave
a
bound
one
hour
more
and
he
should
clutch
it
one
short
hour
more
and
he
should
at
last
be
master
of
his
own
destiny
dependent
on
no
fond
woman
whim
trembling
before
no
children
power
to
change
her
purpose
once
let
her
sign
this
will
thought
he
and
if
i
ever
leave
her
long
enough
unwatched
to
make
another
the
fault
will
be
my
own
and
i
will
abide
the
consequence
with
a
placid
countenance
that
manifested
no
emotion
of
any
kind
cartwright
amused
himself
for
a
few
minutes
in
examining
a
drawing
just
finished
for
the
fancy
fair
by
the
light
of
a
lamp
on
the
and
as
he
passed
behind
his
cousin
to
set
it
down
he
condescendingly
stopped
to
show
it
to
him
pointing
out
its
merits
with
affectionate
admiration
for
the
artist
was
no
other
than
his
accomplished
lady
is
not
the
expression
of
this
head
beautifully
holy
cousin
stephen
just
look
at
the
eyes
chivers
the
butler
her
maid
curtis
and
my
valet
can
witness
it
charming
is
it
not
in
a
short
time
afterwards
cartwright
rose
the
attentive
attorney
sprang
to
the
door
opened
it
and
silently
followed
her
out
of
the
room
henrietta
eye
followed
them
and
she
sighed
heavily
you
do
not
seem
well
miss
cartwright
said
helen
and
i
do
not
feel
gay
what
say
you
to
our
keeping
each
other
in
countenance
and
both
going
to
bed
though
the
clock
has
not
yet
struck
ten
a
comfortable
and
very
wise
proposal
replied
henrietta
rising
at
once
i
am
much
more
inclined
to
be
in
bed
than
up
for
i
would
rather
be
asleep
than
awake
it
is
very
right
for
you
henrietta
who
are
an
invalid
to
be
indulged
in
your
wish
to
retire
early
said
her
father
good
night
i
am
sorry
that
the
accidental
absence
of
your
mother
renders
it
impossible
for
me
to
hasten
the
hour
of
evening
prayer
but
you
shall
have
my
blessing
may
heaven
watch
over
your
slumbers
if
you
close
your
eyes
in
faith
if
not
may
he
visit
you
in
the
night
season
with
such
appalling
thoughts
as
may
awaken
a
right
spirit
within
you
but
for
you
my
dear
child
he
continued
turning
to
helen
i
can
not
suffer
you
to
leave
us
so
prematurely
we
shall
have
prayers
within
an
hour
and
i
do
not
permit
any
member
of
my
family
to
absent
herself
from
the
performance
of
this
sacred
ordinance
without
very
good
and
sufficient
reason
for
so
doing
i
conceive
that
i
have
very
good
and
sufficient
reason
for
so
doing
sir
replied
helen
approaching
the
door
i
wish
you
all
good
night
she
shall
pay
for
this
whispered
one
of
the
little
demons
that
nestled
in
the
vicar
heart
stephen
must
absolve
me
of
my
promise
for
but
if
i
do
not
keep
it
with
him
nobly
on
some
future
occasion
i
will
give
him
leave
to
tear
in
fragments
the
parchment
which
at
this
very
moment
is
growing
into
a
rod
wherewith
to
scourge
the
insolence
of
this
proud
vixen
it
was
probably
not
so
much
the
failing
to
keep
his
promise
with
corbold
which
the
late
hour
might
readily
excuse
as
the
displaying
to
his
slave
and
curate
that
his
power
was
not
absolute
which
galled
him
so
severely
his
wife
and
cousin
however
soon
returned
they
both
looked
placidly
contented
as
those
do
look
who
having
had
important
business
to
transact
have
done
it
well
and
thoroughly
soon
afterwards
the
numerous
household
were
summoned
to
appear
and
the
labours
of
the
day
were
closed
with
prayer
hetherington
uttering
the
extempore
invocation
and
the
vicar
pronouncing
the
blessing
an
arrangement
by
the
way
approved
by
the
master
of
cartwright
park
for
three
especial
reasons
first
it
gave
to
his
establishment
very
greatly
the
effect
of
having
a
domestic
chaplain
at
its
head
secondly
it
afforded
an
opportunity
which
the
worthy
hetherington
never
neglected
of
calling
down
sundry
especial
blessings
on
the
vicar
own
particular
head
and
which
was
perhaps
more
important
still
of
pronouncing
a
lofty
eulogium
on
his
transcendent
virtues
thirdly
the
having
to
rise
from
his
knees
and
pronounce
the
final
blessing
never
failed
to
soothe
his
spirit
with
a
delicious
foreboding
that
he
might
one
day
do
so
likewise
in
his
own
cathedral
and
from
his
own
proper
throne
this
being
an
object
of
ambition
to
him
as
dear
or
dearer
still
than
the
possession
of
the
precious
will
itself
rarely
indeed
did
he
seat
himself
in
his
own
soft
chair
in
his
own
noble
library
without
seeing
in
his
mind
eye
a
mitre
as
distinctly
visible
as
macbeth
dagger
was
to
him
and
the
hope
that
this
crowning
blessing
would
one
day
fall
upon
his
favoured
head
not
only
cheered
every
waking
and
often
every
sleeping
hour
but
made
him
so
generously
come
forward
upon
all
occasions
when
a
penniless
whig
was
to
be
accommodated
with
a
seat
in
a
parliament
or
any
other
subscription
set
on
foot
to
help
the
radical
poor
and
needy
into
political
power
and
place
that
he
was
already
considered
in
the
high
places
as
one
of
the
most
conscientious
and
clergymen
within
the
pale
of
the
established
church
and
almost
supernaturally
gifted
considering
he
was
not
a
roman
catholic
priest
with
the
power
of
judging
political
characters
according
to
their
real
value
as
soon
as
the
prayers
were
ended
the
blessing
spoken
and
the
servants
dismissed
corbold
whose
eyes
had
vainly
wandered
round
the
room
in
search
of
helen
approached
the
vicar
and
said
in
a
very
firm
and
intelligible
tone
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
cousin
cartwright
certainly
replied
his
kinsman
in
a
voice
of
the
most
cordial
friendship
come
into
my
library
with
me
cousin
stephen
and
into
the
library
they
went
and
almost
before
the
door
was
shut
corbold
exclaimed
how
am
i
to
see
miss
helen
cousin
cartwright
if
you
have
let
her
take
herself
off
to
bed
this
very
pertinent
question
was
however
only
answered
by
another
have
you
got
the
will
cousin
stephen
yes
i
have
answered
the
attorney
with
more
boldness
than
he
had
ever
used
in
speaking
to
his
cousin
since
he
became
a
great
man
but
a
bargain
a
bargain
i
know
it
is
cousin
and
heaven
preserve
to
me
my
lawful
rights
and
inheritance
as
i
faithfully
keep
to
you
the
word
i
have
given
and
how
is
it
to
be
managed
then
am
i
to
go
to
the
give
me
the
will
cousin
stephen
said
the
vicar
holding
out
his
hand
to
receive
it
and
i
will
satisfy
you
fully
upon
this
matter
corbold
however
looked
extremely
rebellious
and
no
corner
of
parchment
could
be
descried
about
any
part
of
his
person
a
bargain
a
bargain
i
tell
you
cousin
william
he
repeated
doggedly
and
you
may
as
well
remember
that
a
lawyer
that
is
intrusted
with
the
keeping
of
a
will
is
no
way
bound
to
give
it
up
particularly
to
the
party
whom
it
chiefly
concerns
cartwright
measured
his
contumacious
relative
with
his
eye
very
much
as
if
he
intended
to
floor
and
rifle
him
but
wiser
thoughts
prevailed
and
he
gently
replied
seating
himself
in
his
own
peculiar
chair
and
making
a
sign
to
his
companion
that
he
should
place
himself
opposite
may
he
cousin
stephen
whose
professing
servants
we
are
save
and
deliver
us
from
quarrelling
with
one
another
especially
at
a
blessed
moment
like
this
when
every
thing
seems
fitted
by
his
holy
providence
so
as
to
ensure
us
peace
and
prosperity
in
this
world
and
doubtless
everlasting
glory
in
the
life
to
come
all
that
very
true
cousin
cartwright
and
if
your
cloth
and
calling
set
you
to
speak
of
heavenly
things
especial
grace
years
ago
manifested
in
me
makes
me
nothing
behind
you
in
the
same
but
for
all
that
i
know
well
enough
that
there
many
a
unprofessing
lawyer
who
would
gain
credit
and
honour
both
by
taking
care
to
let
young
mowbray
know
what
that
pious
lady
his
mother
has
been
about
instead
of
keeping
the
thing
as
secret
as
if
it
were
a
forgery
of
my
own
and
it
is
but
common
justice
between
man
and
man
to
say
nothing
of
cousins
and
professing
christians
that
conduct
so
every
way
convenient
and
considerate
as
mine
should
not
go
unrewarded
i
have
set
my
heart
upon
having
that
girl
helen
and
i
do
wish
for
any
thing
in
the
end
but
lawful
wedlock
and
all
that
and
the
more
because
i
take
it
for
granted
that
you
do
mean
altogether
to
leave
the
young
woman
without
fortune
but
she
restive
cousin
and
that
you
know
and
we
are
therefore
called
upon
as
men
and
christians
to
make
use
and
profit
of
that
wit
and
strength
which
it
hath
pleased
providence
in
its
wisdom
to
give
us
over
the
weaker
vessel
and
all
i
ask
of
you
is
so
to
put
it
within
my
reach
and
power
to
do
this
that
the
righteous
ends
we
have
in
view
may
be
obtained
through
the
same
i
have
heard
you
to
the
end
cousin
stephen
which
will
i
trust
considering
all
things
be
accepted
in
token
of
an
humble
spirit
what
you
have
said
however
excepting
that
it
was
needless
is
altogether
reasonable
and
betokens
that
wisdom
of
which
the
lord
hath
seen
fit
to
make
you
an
example
upon
the
earth
but
you
find
that
my
conscience
needed
not
your
reproof
few
hours
have
passed
since
i
gave
proof
sufficient
of
the
sincerity
with
which
i
desire
to
strengthen
the
ties
between
us
by
the
accident
of
the
being
brought
into
my
room
i
was
made
aware
that
it
contained
a
letter
addressed
to
helen
mowbray
evidently
in
the
handwriting
of
a
man
and
what
could
it
be
to
me
cousin
stephen
whether
that
unconverted
girl
got
a
letter
from
a
man
or
went
without
it
nothing
positively
nothing
but
i
remembered
me
of
you
cousin
and
of
the
tender
affections
which
you
had
fixed
upon
her
and
fearless
of
consequences
i
instantly
broke
the
seal
and
found
as
i
expected
a
very
proposal
of
marriage
without
the
decency
of
any
allusion
whatever
to
my
will
in
the
business
and
i
therefore
of
course
felt
it
my
duty
to
destroy
it
both
for
your
sake
and
that
of
the
lord
whose
blessing
the
impious
young
man
did
not
deem
it
necessary
to
mention
nevertheless
the
proposal
came
from
one
of
the
first
families
in
the
county
and
the
girl
would
have
been
my
lady
in
due
course
of
nature
a
thing
not
altogether
without
value
to
her
family
and
but
i
never
hesitated
for
one
moment
and
you
may
see
the
ashes
of
colonel
harrington
under
the
grate
that
was
acting
like
the
good
and
chosen
servant
cousin
william
that
i
have
long
known
you
to
be
but
such
being
the
case
why
have
you
scrupled
to
let
me
speak
to
the
young
girl
this
night
in
private
for
the
good
and
sufficient
reason
that
she
chose
to
go
even
though
i
told
her
to
stay
and
without
exposing
myself
to
a
very
unpleasant
scene
before
my
curate
and
the
rest
of
my
people
i
could
not
have
detained
her
besides
at
the
moment
of
her
departure
i
knew
that
the
will
which
you
still
keep
from
me
cousin
stephen
was
not
either
signed
or
executed
another
good
and
sufficient
reason
as
i
take
it
for
not
choosing
to
keep
the
girl
back
by
force
but
fear
nothing
what
i
have
promised
that
i
will
perform
give
me
the
will
cousin
stephen
and
i
will
tell
you
what
my
scheme
is
for
you
tell
me
the
scheme
first
cousin
william
that
is
but
square
and
fair
we
lawyers
have
got
our
ceremonies
as
well
as
the
clergy
and
i
see
why
they
should
be
broken
through
i
do
very
well
know
what
you
mean
by
ceremonies
in
this
case
cousin
and
i
do
think
you
take
the
best
way
to
oblige
me
however
i
am
not
going
to
shrink
from
my
word
for
that
all
i
expect
cousin
stephen
is
your
word
pledged
to
me
in
return
that
let
what
will
happen
you
will
bring
no
scandal
or
dishonour
upon
my
family
for
so
doing
might
be
of
the
greatest
injury
to
my
hopes
i
mean
nothing
but
honour
cousin
william
replied
corbold
eagerly
let
me
have
but
a
fair
opportunity
given
me
and
you
shall
find
that
though
i
use
it
i
will
not
abuse
it
tell
me
then
what
is
your
scheme
you
know
that
on
the
of
this
month
a
serious
fancy
fair
is
to
be
held
in
my
grounds
not
only
will
all
the
rank
and
fashion
of
the
county
assemble
on
the
occasion
but
my
will
be
open
likewise
to
the
people
at
two
a
very
splendid
collation
will
be
ready
in
five
of
my
saloons
and
it
is
after
the
company
have
risen
and
left
the
tables
to
resort
once
more
to
the
booths
in
order
to
assist
in
the
disposal
of
the
remaining
articles
that
i
shall
permit
every
servant
in
my
establishment
to
leave
the
mansion
and
repair
to
witness
the
busy
and
impressive
scene
in
the
booths
it
will
be
a
very
impressive
scene
cousin
stephen
for
i
shall
myself
pronounce
a
blessing
upon
the
assembled
crowd
from
this
i
fear
my
dear
stephen
that
you
must
on
this
occasion
absent
yourself
but
be
assured
that
as
i
speak
those
words
of
power
i
will
remember
you
when
you
shall
see
a
rush
of
my
hired
servants
pour
forth
from
my
mansion
upon
my
lawns
it
is
then
that
i
shall
counsel
you
to
retire
enter
the
house
by
the
library
windows
and
if
questioned
say
you
are
sent
there
on
an
errand
by
me
from
my
library
find
your
way
up
the
grand
staircase
to
the
small
apartment
which
i
permit
my
wife
to
appropriate
as
her
the
same
in
which
you
have
this
night
executed
as
i
trust
her
will
there
remain
concealed
perhaps
behind
the
curtains
till
helen
mowbray
enters
i
will
deposit
in
that
room
something
valuable
and
curious
for
sale
which
shall
be
forgotten
till
you
are
safely
hidden
there
and
then
i
will
command
my
very
dear
and
obedient
wife
to
send
miss
helen
to
seek
for
it
does
this
plan
please
you
cousin
before
speaking
a
word
corbold
drew
the
will
from
his
long
coat
pocket
and
placed
it
in
the
hands
of
the
vicar
this
was
a
species
of
mute
eloquence
most
perfectly
understood
by
the
person
to
whom
it
was
addressed
the
vicar
of
wrexhill
received
the
parchment
with
much
solemnity
in
his
two
hands
and
bending
his
head
upon
it
exclaimed
may
the
blessing
of
the
lord
be
with
me
and
my
heirs
for
ever
it
may
possibly
appear
improbable
to
many
persons
that
such
a
phrase
as
this
last
should
recur
in
ordinary
discourse
so
frequently
as
i
have
represented
it
to
do
but
to
those
not
belonging
to
the
sect
and
therefore
not
so
familiarized
with
its
phraseology
as
to
be
unconscious
of
its
peculiarity
and
who
yet
have
been
thrown
by
accident
within
reach
of
hearing
it
i
need
offer
no
explanation
for
they
must
know
by
experience
that
this
or
expressions
of
equally
religious
formation
and
import
are
in
constant
use
among
them
sometimes
especially
in
the
company
of
the
profane
they
are
uttered
as
if
to
satisfy
the
secret
conscience
sometimes
in
equally
society
they
are
pronounced
aloud
and
with
most
distinct
emphasis
as
if
to
show
that
the
speaker
feared
not
the
ribald
laugh
of
the
scorner
and
held
himself
ready
to
perform
this
or
any
other
feat
likely
to
ensure
the
same
petty
but
glorious
martyrdom
despite
any
possible
quantum
of
absurdity
that
may
attach
thereto
the
two
kinsmen
being
now
mutually
satisfied
with
each
other
conduct
shook
hands
and
parted
corbold
ruminating
as
he
walked
slowly
back
to
wrexhill
on
the
happy
termination
to
which
he
was
at
last
likely
to
bring
his
hitherto
unpropitious
wooing
and
cartwright
gazing
with
unspeakable
delight
on
the
signatures
and
seals
which
secured
to
him
and
his
heirs
for
ever
the
possession
of
all
the
wealth
and
state
in
which
he
now
revelled
having
satisfied
himself
that
all
was
right
he
opened
a
secret
drawer
in
his
library
table
laid
the
precious
parchment
within
it
and
having
turned
the
lock
actually
kissed
the
key
that
secured
his
treasure
he
then
carefully
secured
it
to
his
and
returned
to
escort
his
lady
to
her
chamber
chapter
x
the
serious
fancy
fair
there
were
but
few
families
within
an
ordinary
visiting
distance
of
the
park
who
had
not
called
on
cartwright
upon
her
marriage
some
went
from
simple
curiosity
some
expressly
to
quiz
her
a
few
from
feelings
of
real
kindness
towards
the
young
people
whom
it
would
be
they
said
a
shame
to
give
up
merely
because
their
mother
had
played
the
fool
and
ruined
all
their
prospects
not
a
few
for
the
fun
of
seeing
mowbray
park
turned
into
a
conventicle
and
the
inhabitants
into
its
congregation
and
the
rest
came
principally
because
cartwright
was
such
a
pious
man
and
likely
to
do
so
much
good
in
the
neighbourhood
among
all
these
the
fancy
fair
announced
to
be
held
there
on
the
of
july
created
a
lively
interest
all
the
world
determined
to
attend
and
half
the
world
gave
themselves
up
to
the
making
of
pincushions
and
with
as
much
zeal
as
if
the
entire
remnant
of
the
jewish
people
as
well
as
the
whole
population
of
fababo
were
to
be
converted
thereby
the
mansion
and
grounds
of
cartwright
residence
began
to
give
note
of
very
great
and
splendid
preparation
for
this
serious
fête
never
had
the
reverend
vicar
been
seen
in
such
spirits
on
any
former
occasion
his
bosom
lord
sat
lightly
on
his
throne
and
due
allowance
being
made
for
the
nature
of
the
proceedings
it
might
safely
be
averred
that
no
entertainment
ever
given
in
the
neighbourhood
had
caused
more
sensation
or
been
prepared
for
with
a
more
lavish
expenditure
the
whole
of
the
and
days
of
the
month
were
entirely
employed
by
the
majority
of
the
cartwright
household
in
receiving
and
arranging
the
different
works
of
fancy
contributed
by
the
neighbouring
ladies
for
the
sale
by
far
the
greater
half
of
these
articles
were
pincushions
and
for
the
most
part
they
packed
and
unpacked
well
and
safely
but
amidst
the
vast
variety
of
forms
into
which
this
favourite
vehicle
of
charity
was
turned
some
among
them
were
equally
ingenious
in
design
delicate
in
execution
and
difficult
of
carriage
there
were
harps
of
which
the
strings
were
actually
musical
and
the
foot
a
pincushion
old
women
of
pasteboard
washing
their
feet
in
a
pasteboard
tub
but
with
knees
stuffed
for
pincushions
pasteboard
the
hunches
being
pincushions
babies
dressed
with
the
nicest
taste
and
care
their
plump
little
necks
and
shoulders
forming
pincushions
pretty
silken
volumes
lettered
pointed
satires
and
their
yellow
edges
stuffed
for
pincushions
ladies
very
fashionably
dressed
with
the
crowns
of
their
bonnets
and
their
graceful
backs
prepared
as
pincushions
these
and
ten
thousand
more
of
which
a
prolonged
description
might
probably
prove
tedious
formed
the
staple
commodity
of
the
elegant
booths
which
stretched
themselves
in
two
long
rows
from
one
extremity
of
the
beautiful
lawn
to
the
other
tracts
so
numerous
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
give
their
measure
or
their
value
by
any
other
calculation
than
that
of
their
weight
were
made
by
the
ingenuity
of
the
fair
and
pious
contributors
to
assume
a
very
tempting
aspect
bound
by
their
own
delicate
hands
in
silks
and
velvets
of
every
hue
to
be
found
between
earth
and
heaven
green
and
blue
inclusive
it
would
be
quite
impossible
to
give
any
thing
deserving
the
name
of
a
catalogue
of
the
articles
contributed
to
this
charming
exhibition
and
it
will
therefore
be
better
not
to
attempt
it
it
will
be
sufficient
to
observe
that
by
a
sentiment
of
elegant
refinement
which
seemed
to
have
pervaded
all
the
contributors
every
article
to
which
the
idea
of
utility
could
attach
was
scrupulously
banished
it
not
being
fair
as
some
of
the
ladies
very
judiciously
observed
to
injure
the
poor
shopkeepers
by
permitting
the
sale
of
any
thing
that
any
body
in
the
world
could
really
wish
to
buy
one
instance
of
very
delicate
attention
on
the
part
of
cartwright
towards
the
hero
of
the
fête
deserves
to
be
recorded
as
showing
both
the
natural
kindness
of
her
temper
and
the
respect
in
which
every
feeling
of
this
celebrated
character
was
held
among
the
almost
incredible
number
of
devices
for
winding
silks
or
for
converting
them
into
bobbins
or
for
some
other
of
the
ingenious
little
contrivances
invented
for
one
hardly
knows
what
was
a
very
pretty
thing
more
in
the
shape
of
a
jew
harp
than
any
thing
else
the
instant
cartwright
cast
her
eyes
on
this
she
ordered
it
to
be
withdrawn
observing
that
as
the
reverend
isaac
isaacs
himself
was
expected
to
honour
the
entertainment
with
his
presence
she
could
by
no
means
permit
any
thing
bearing
such
a
name
to
appear
it
may
be
feared
that
it
was
with
a
far
different
spirit
jacob
cartwright
on
hearing
his
stepmother
mention
this
exclusion
and
the
motive
for
it
proposed
that
all
the
cold
chickens
and
turkies
to
be
eaten
at
the
banquet
should
appear
without
their
usual
accompaniment
of
cold
hams
a
pleasantry
which
though
it
won
a
smile
from
his
indulgent
father
was
by
no
means
well
received
by
cartwright
the
twelfth
day
of
july
itself
arrived
at
last
and
fortunately
was
as
fine
a
day
as
ever
shone
helen
asked
rosalind
if
she
remembered
the
day
on
which
charles
came
of
age
and
the
question
brought
tears
to
the
eyes
of
both
this
however
was
but
a
trifling
exception
to
the
general
cheerfulness
all
the
world
really
looked
as
gay
as
if
the
fancy
fair
were
not
a
serious
one
in
one
of
the
long
and
elegantly
decorated
booths
indeed
one
silly
young
girl
was
heard
to
exclaim
oh
what
a
beautiful
place
this
would
be
for
dancing
but
the
levity
was
checked
by
cartwright
who
happening
to
overhear
her
replied
my
dear
young
lady
there
is
no
dancing
in
heaven
it
had
been
settled
among
the
ladies
of
the
neighbourhood
on
the
first
announcement
of
this
pious
and
charitable
undertaking
that
no
ladies
either
married
or
single
should
be
invited
to
sell
the
articles
and
for
some
time
after
the
circulation
of
this
decision
it
appeared
to
be
very
doubtful
whether
there
would
be
any
ladies
found
not
actually
too
decrepit
to
endure
the
fatigue
who
would
be
willing
to
undertake
it
this
circumstance
threw
poor
cartwright
into
great
embarrassment
the
idea
of
having
advertised
a
fancy
fair
and
then
to
be
unable
to
procure
ladies
to
preside
at
it
was
a
vexation
almost
beyond
what
even
a
professing
christian
patience
could
bear
when
at
length
it
appeared
evident
that
every
lady
for
ten
miles
round
had
for
some
excellent
good
reason
or
other
declined
the
office
cartwright
proposed
that
gentlemen
instead
of
ladies
should
perform
it
but
to
this
miss
charlotte
richards
who
happened
to
be
present
when
the
difficulty
was
discussed
entered
a
violent
protest
declaring
that
she
was
quite
sure
if
such
a
measure
were
resorted
to
not
one
hundredth
part
of
the
goods
would
be
sold
neither
jew
nor
gentile
she
assured
them
would
ever
make
any
thing
by
it
if
such
a
project
were
resorted
to
and
in
short
she
pleaded
the
cause
of
the
ladies
so
well
that
after
some
time
it
was
agreed
that
the
original
principle
should
be
altogether
changed
and
that
the
youngest
and
prettiest
ladies
should
be
selected
only
with
this
condition
annexed
that
they
should
all
be
dressed
in
uniform
the
form
and
material
of
which
were
to
be
specified
by
cartwright
the
circular
letter
announcing
this
alteration
was
composed
by
cartwright
himself
and
proved
perfectly
successful
although
it
contained
but
few
words
it
having
been
decided
at
a
meeting
of
some
of
the
senior
supporters
of
the
south
central
african
bible
association
that
the
cause
of
the
poor
inhabitants
of
fababo
was
one
which
ought
to
be
peculiarly
interesting
to
the
young
and
lovely
inasmuch
as
it
is
beyond
all
others
the
cause
of
piety
it
was
therefore
strongly
recommended
that
they
should
be
especially
chosen
and
elected
to
serve
the
office
of
vendors
or
sellers
at
the
fancy
fair
instituted
by
the
reverend
william
jacob
cartwright
and
by
him
appointed
to
be
held
on
his
own
premises
after
which
followed
a
request
that
such
ladies
as
were
kindly
willing
to
undertake
the
fatigues
of
the
office
would
forthwith
forward
their
names
to
cartwright
that
they
might
receive
from
her
instructions
respecting
the
uniform
to
be
worn
on
the
occasion
the
number
of
applications
for
permission
to
sell
which
followed
the
circulation
of
this
letter
was
quite
extraordinary
and
so
greatly
exceeded
the
number
required
that
the
task
of
selection
became
difficult
if
not
impossible
so
it
was
finally
decided
that
a
description
of
the
uniform
should
be
sent
to
them
all
and
that
those
who
arrived
first
should
be
installed
in
their
office
under
condition
of
permitting
a
relay
to
succeed
them
after
the
enjoyment
of
two
hours
of
duty
the
consequence
of
this
was
that
at
a
very
early
hour
not
only
all
the
young
and
handsome
part
of
the
company
expected
but
all
who
considered
themselves
as
belonging
to
that
class
were
seen
arriving
in
their
very
becoming
suits
with
their
smooth
braided
tresses
and
quakerish
bonnets
and
caps
let
all
the
ladies
in
the
serious
uniform
stand
up
together
behind
the
stalls
if
they
like
it
said
the
accommodating
cartwright
it
would
be
so
very
difficult
to
select
and
they
will
all
look
so
very
well
as
the
stalls
were
all
ready
having
been
walked
round
through
and
about
by
and
cartwright
hetherington
the
curate
chivers
the
butler
curtis
the
lady
maid
as
well
as
all
the
other
serious
servants
and
all
agreeing
in
the
opinion
that
it
was
impossible
any
thing
could
be
more
beautiful
the
uniform
ladies
were
ushered
into
them
and
begged
to
decide
among
themselves
the
order
in
which
they
should
stand
the
manner
in
which
this
system
worked
was
amusing
and
rosalind
torrington
stood
by
and
enjoyed
it
greatly
as
soon
as
it
was
notified
to
the
young
and
pretty
ladies
that
the
booths
were
all
ready
the
prices
of
every
article
marked
and
all
things
prepared
so
that
they
might
take
their
places
behind
the
stands
in
such
order
as
they
should
agree
among
themselves
any
one
who
had
witnessed
and
watched
the
sweet
universal
smile
with
which
each
one
regarded
the
other
and
the
charming
accents
in
which
all
exclaimed
as
with
one
voice
oh
it
is
exactly
the
same
to
me
where
i
stand
would
have
been
ready
to
declare
that
even
their
youth
and
beauty
were
less
attractive
than
the
sweet
temper
which
seemed
to
be
so
universal
among
them
the
fair
bevy
amounting
to
above
fifty
poured
themselves
by
various
entrances
into
the
booths
which
were
in
fact
a
succession
of
very
handsome
tents
against
the
sides
of
which
were
ranged
the
elegantly
decorated
stands
while
through
the
whole
extent
a
space
of
nearly
thirty
feet
was
left
for
promenading
in
the
centre
of
the
range
the
gaily
painted
canvass
rose
into
a
lofty
point
from
which
to
the
extremity
of
the
circle
round
it
depended
graceful
draperies
festooned
with
large
bunches
of
flowers
in
the
middle
of
this
noble
circular
tent
stood
a
lofty
frame
supporting
the
finest
greenhouse
plants
and
the
stalls
which
here
skirted
the
sides
of
the
enclosure
were
decidedly
more
distinguished
by
their
elegant
decorations
than
the
rest
oh
dear
how
lovely
was
the
universal
exclamation
uttered
by
the
ladies
on
entering
this
beautiful
circle
well
i
think
i
will
stand
here
said
one
of
the
most
lively
and
enterprising
among
them
placing
herself
at
the
same
time
behind
a
world
of
paper
and
silk
commodities
close
to
which
was
a
side
entrance
arched
with
evergreen
boughs
and
gay
with
a
thousand
blossoms
and
i
will
take
this
stand
cried
a
stout
and
demoiselle
stepping
out
with
great
activity
to
secure
the
one
opposite
this
will
just
suit
me
said
a
third
popping
into
another
of
the
enviable
stations
which
flanked
the
garlanded
entrances
and
immediately
taking
possession
of
its
lofty
seat
and
comfortable
footstool
up
to
this
point
the
universal
smile
continued
with
an
almost
unabated
display
of
charming
teeth
but
to
the
fourth
place
promising
equal
affluence
of
to
the
three
already
taken
no
less
than
four
ladies
rushed
at
once
and
then
began
the
civil
war
which
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
as
circumstances
may
excite
or
assuage
it
rages
at
all
fancy
fairs
bazaars
and
charity
sales
of
every
class
and
denomination
whatever
some
folks
uninitiated
in
such
matters
may
suppose
that
there
is
less
of
this
at
a
serious
fancy
fair
than
at
one
professing
to
be
gay
but
a
little
experience
will
rapidly
undeceive
them
whether
the
benevolent
be
beautiful
saints
or
beautiful
sinners
the
inclination
to
show
off
nature
gifts
to
the
best
advantage
is
pretty
nearly
the
same
and
whether
the
sweet
graceful
thanks
so
softly
uttered
be
constructed
after
one
form
or
another
the
pleasure
of
speaking
them
is
the
same
likewise
what
matters
it
whether
a
bright
eye
laugh
from
beneath
a
drapery
of
pendent
curls
or
is
raised
to
heaven
with
no
twisted
meshes
to
obscure
its
upward
ray
what
matters
it
whether
ruby
lips
open
to
say
heaven
reward
you
sir
our
poor
missionaries
shall
pray
for
you
or
thank
you
with
a
familiar
nod
some
dear
spanish
whiskerandos
shall
buy
a
sword
with
this
in
both
cases
the
speaker
would
indisputably
prefer
having
a
stand
to
speak
from
and
if
it
chance
to
be
placed
beside
some
avenue
through
which
the
crowd
must
pass
and
repass
incessantly
why
so
much
the
better
the
four
ladies
that
met
together
with
more
of
haste
than
inclination
at
the
last
of
the
stands
as
above
described
were
really
considering
all
things
exceedingly
civil
to
each
other
at
the
early
part
of
a
busy
day
the
temper
can
bear
much
more
without
wincing
than
after
it
has
been
battered
and
bruised
by
all
the
little
that
are
almost
sure
to
beset
it
before
the
close
of
it
i
beg
your
pardon
but
i
believe
i
was
here
first
oh
dear
i
hope
i
did
not
hurt
you
but
this
is
my
place
you
must
let
me
stand
here
dear
ladies
for
i
have
set
my
heart
upon
it
comprised
very
nearly
all
the
spoken
part
of
the
contest
a
few
sidelong
glances
there
might
have
been
and
one
or
two
almost
invisible
but
after
all
the
person
who
finally
got
possession
of
the
desired
post
was
a
tall
thin
pale
and
remarkably
pious
maiden
who
having
laid
her
hand
upon
the
board
and
her
foot
upon
the
stool
moved
them
no
more
but
who
from
first
to
last
did
not
pronounce
a
single
word
though
these
four
favourite
seats
were
thus
rapidly
taken
possession
of
there
was
still
a
good
deal
to
be
struggled
for
it
appeared
indeed
for
some
time
that
all
the
fifty
young
and
handsome
ladies
had
firmly
made
up
their
minds
to
station
themselves
in
the
circular
tent
and
nowhere
else
greatly
did
the
peaceable
cartwright
rejoice
that
she
had
from
the
first
desired
the
ladies
to
please
themselves
for
it
soon
became
evident
that
it
would
have
been
no
easy
task
for
her
to
please
them
very
continuous
buzzings
made
themselves
heard
around
the
canvass
walls
and
remonstrances
were
occasionally
audible
really
ladies
i
think
we
are
very
close
here
would
it
not
be
better
for
some
of
the
ladies
to
move
on
i
believe
that
you
will
find
no
room
just
here
and
upon
my
word
i
must
beg
you
not
to
press
upon
me
so
were
sentences
distinctly
repeated
in
more
places
than
one
at
length
things
or
rather
ladies
began
to
arrange
themselves
in
tolerable
order
the
difficulty
being
got
over
at
last
as
always
happens
upon
such
occasions
by
the
best
tempers
taking
the
worst
places
it
was
an
almost
simultaneous
rush
of
carriages
through
the
park
gates
and
the
approach
of
many
persons
on
foot
by
various
entrances
which
at
last
produced
this
desirable
effect
cartwright
now
came
forth
in
all
his
glory
from
beneath
the
shelter
of
a
sort
of
canvass
portico
that
formed
the
entrance
to
the
principal
line
of
tents
almost
innumerable
were
the
hands
he
shook
the
bows
he
made
and
the
smiles
he
smiled
it
is
perfectly
impossible
that
he
could
have
sustained
so
radiant
and
benevolent
a
graciousness
to
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
men
had
not
his
animal
spirits
been
sustained
by
the
recollection
that
the
little
key
which
dangled
from
his
and
with
which
he
constantly
dallied
when
any
of
his
ten
fingers
were
disengaged
from
kept
watch
and
ward
over
his
lady
will
cartwright
meanwhile
not
being
in
a
situation
to
endure
the
fatigue
of
standing
sat
with
some
dozen
chairs
around
her
waiting
for
the
most
distinguished
guests
within
the
flowery
shelter
of
this
same
pretty
portico
round
which
were
ranged
and
various
other
fragrant
plants
reaching
from
the
ground
almost
to
the
roof
whenever
any
person
arrived
of
sufficient
importance
to
be
so
distinguished
the
vicar
of
wrexhill
himself
ushered
them
to
the
presence
of
his
lady
and
those
so
honoured
at
length
filled
all
the
chairs
around
her
to
all
the
rest
cartwright
bowed
and
smiled
as
they
passed
onward
as
they
all
most
obediently
did
in
compliance
with
the
mandate
of
their
host
who
continued
to
utter
with
little
intermission
straight
on
if
you
please
straight
on
and
you
will
reach
the
centre
pavilion
between
the
spot
at
which
the
carriages
set
down
the
company
and
the
entrance
to
this
portico
four
servants
in
rich
liveries
were
stationed
to
pass
their
names
to
chivers
who
stood
within
it
at
length
a
party
who
had
walked
across
the
park
and
entered
on
the
lawn
by
the
little
hand
gate
to
pass
through
which
the
present
master
of
the
domain
had
once
considered
as
his
dearest
privilege
approached
the
entrance
at
a
point
by
which
they
escaped
three
out
of
the
four
reverberations
of
their
names
and
were
very
quietly
stepping
under
the
draperied
entrance
when
the
fourth
now
stopped
them
short
to
demand
their
style
and
title
and
the
miss
richards
lord
hilton
screamed
the
domestic
who
it
may
be
observed
in
passing
had
like
most
of
his
fellows
answered
one
of
cartwright
advertisements
headed
thus
wanted
to
live
in
the
country
a
serious
footman
no
sooner
did
the
title
reach
the
vicar
ears
than
he
dropped
pious
somebody
hand
which
he
was
affectionately
pressing
and
turning
short
round
met
the
cold
glance
of
the
major
dalrymple
who
advanced
with
richards
upon
one
arm
and
his
affianced
mary
on
the
other
a
moment
of
rather
awkward
deliberation
ensued
as
to
whether
the
man
or
the
man
title
should
modify
the
manner
of
his
reception
but
before
the
question
could
be
decided
the
party
had
quietly
passed
on
without
appearing
to
perceive
him
the
two
elder
miss
richards
followed
both
of
them
having
been
obliged
to
relinquish
their
hopes
of
presiding
at
a
stand
in
consequence
of
the
expensive
nature
of
the
uniform
these
two
young
ladies
who
from
the
first
hour
of
their
conversion
had
really
been
among
the
most
faithful
followers
of
the
vicar
of
wrexhill
in
all
ways
ready
to
be
in
love
with
him
ready
to
pray
with
him
and
now
ready
to
bow
before
him
as
almost
the
greatest
man
in
the
county
were
not
perhaps
greeted
with
all
the
distinguished
kindness
they
deserved
unfortunately
for
their
feelings
cartwright
was
more
awake
to
the
fact
that
they
were
sisters
to
little
mary
than
to
their
very
excellent
chance
of
becoming
to
a
nobleman
and
so
they
too
passed
on
without
pausing
as
they
had
intended
to
do
for
the
expression
of
their
unbounded
admiration
for
him
and
his
fancy
fair
nearly
the
whole
of
the
invited
society
were
already
assembled
and
the
park
was
beginning
to
fill
with
the
multitude
which
was
to
be
admitted
to
the
tents
after
the
collation
when
at
length
the
reverend
isaac
isaacs
was
announced
the
arrival
of
the
hero
of
the
day
produced
as
may
be
supposed
a
very
powerful
sensation
his
name
was
no
sooner
pronounced
by
the
servants
than
it
was
caught
up
by
the
company
and
borne
along
from
mouth
to
mouth
till
every
individual
of
the
crowd
which
filled
the
tents
was
made
acquainted
with
the
interesting
fact
that
the
reverend
isaac
isaacs
was
approaching
the
effect
of
this
was
for
some
moments
really
alarming
every
christian
soul
turned
back
to
welcome
the
converted
jew
and
something
nearly
resembling
suffocation
ensued
indeed
when
the
throng
which
pressed
back
to
meet
him
met
that
which
had
turned
to
follow
him
as
he
laboured
to
make
his
way
between
the
stands
the
crush
was
really
terrible
and
had
there
not
fortunately
been
many
lateral
exits
through
which
those
escaped
who
loved
their
lives
better
than
the
gratification
of
their
curiosity
the
consequences
might
have
been
very
serious
not
all
however
whose
strength
and
whose
zeal
induced
them
to
remain
could
get
a
sight
of
this
desired
of
all
eyes
for
as
isaacs
was
a
very
short
man
those
only
who
were
very
close
could
distinguish
him
the
effect
of
this
procession
however
through
the
double
row
of
stands
still
thickly
studded
with
pincushions
every
one
of
which
had
been
made
for
his
sake
was
very
impressive
and
rendered
greatly
more
so
by
every
fair
mounting
upon
the
high
seat
with
which
she
was
furnished
for
occasional
rest
and
thus
looking
down
upon
him
as
he
passed
in
attitudes
that
displayed
both
courage
and
enthusiasm
the
weather
was
intensely
hot
and
more
than
once
he
appeared
nearly
overcome
by
his
emotions
he
expressed
the
greatest
concern
for
having
arrived
so
late
and
especially
for
having
missed
the
opening
prayer
which
as
he
imagined
had
been
pronounced
by
cartwright
himself
but
when
it
was
explained
to
him
that
this
was
not
the
case
and
moreover
that
he
was
not
too
late
to
share
the
blessing
to
be
given
by
that
gentleman
he
became
more
reconciled
to
the
accident
which
had
detained
him
and
gave
himself
wholly
up
to
the
enjoyment
of
the
striking
spectacle
that
surrounded
him
after
he
had
remained
for
some
time
in
the
central
pavilion
gazing
and
gazed
at
in
a
manner
which
it
was
extremely
interesting
to
watch
some
one
well
acquainted
with
the
best
method
of
carrying
on
the
business
of
such
a
meeting
as
the
present
suggested
that
it
would
be
advisable
that
the
acolyte
should
retire
till
the
sale
of
the
goods
was
pretty
well
completed
for
if
the
feeling
among
the
charitable
crowd
were
permitted
to
exhaust
itself
in
affectionate
glances
towards
isaacs
no
more
money
would
be
collected
and
it
was
also
judiciously
remarked
that
it
might
be
as
well
to
circulate
through
the
company
the
assurance
that
as
soon
as
the
stalls
were
about
cleared
the
banquet
would
be
announced
the
effect
of
these
suggestions
was
speedily
visible
isaacs
stood
in
the
enjoyment
of
space
and
fresh
air
before
the
entrance
to
the
portico
engrossing
the
almost
undivided
attention
of
his
great
patron
while
ladies
peeped
at
him
from
a
respectful
distance
and
chivers
himself
with
a
look
as
reverential
as
if
he
were
waiting
upon
an
apostle
approached
him
with
madeira
and
soda
water
the
sale
meanwhile
benefited
equally
by
his
near
presence
and
his
actual
absence
enthusiasm
was
raised
without
being
disturbed
in
that
great
object
of
all
english
christian
enthusiasm
the
disbursing
of
money
and
by
four
such
a
report
was
made
of
the
general
receipts
that
the
selling
ladies
were
waited
upon
by
as
many
clergymen
as
could
be
collected
to
hand
them
from
their
stands
to
the
banquet
and
when
these
were
all
furnished
with
a
fair
partner
the
most
serious
gentlemen
among
the
company
were
requested
to
take
charge
of
the
rest
cartwright
herself
was
led
to
the
great
by
isaacs
and
for
this
reason
or
else
because
it
was
the
great
the
crowd
which
followed
her
became
so
oppressive
that
the
doors
of
the
room
were
ordered
to
be
closed
and
strictly
guarded
this
measure
was
equally
serviceable
to
those
within
and
without
for
no
sooner
was
it
fully
understood
that
this
decisive
mode
had
been
resorted
to
than
the
other
tables
were
instantly
filled
and
nothing
could
be
more
satisfactory
than
the
activity
with
which
eating
and
drinking
proceeded
in
all
directions
the
champagne
flowed
freely
and
whether
it
were
that
the
sacred
cause
for
which
the
meeting
was
assembled
appeared
to
justify
or
at
least
excuse
some
little
excess
or
that
nothing
furnished
at
cartwright
board
but
must
bring
a
blessing
to
him
who
swallowed
it
or
that
the
fervent
season
led
to
thirst
and
thirst
to
copious
libations
whatever
the
cause
it
is
certain
that
a
very
large
quantity
of
wine
was
swallowed
that
day
and
that
even
the
most
serious
of
the
party
felt
their
spirits
considerably
elevated
thereby
but
in
recording
this
fact
it
should
be
mentioned
likewise
that
excepting
in
some
few
instances
in
which
thirst
good
wine
and
indiscretion
united
to
overpower
some
unfortunate
individuals
the
serious
gentlemen
of
the
party
though
elevated
were
far
from
drunk
and
the
tone
of
their
conversation
only
became
more
animated
without
losing
any
portion
of
the
peculiar
jargon
which
distinguished
it
when
they
were
perfectly
sober
the
discourse
especially
which
was
carried
on
round
cartwright
after
the
ladies
retired
was
for
the
most
part
of
the
most
purely
calvinistical
cast
though
some
of
the
anecdotes
related
might
perhaps
in
their
details
have
partaken
more
of
the
nature
of
miracles
than
they
would
have
done
if
fewer
champagne
corks
had
saluted
the
ceiling
one
clerical
gentleman
for
instance
a
thompson
who
was
much
distinguished
for
his
piety
stated
as
a
fact
which
had
happened
to
himself
that
in
his
early
days
before
the
gift
of
extempore
preaching
was
fully
come
upon
him
he
was
one
at
the
house
of
a
reverend
friend
who
being
taken
suddenly
ill
desired
thompson
to
preach
for
him
at
the
same
time
furnishing
him
with
the
written
discourse
which
he
had
been
himself
about
to
deliver
i
mounted
the
pulpit
said
thompson
with
this
written
sermon
in
my
pocket
but
the
moment
i
drew
it
forth
and
opened
it
i
perceived
to
my
inexpressible
dismay
that
the
handwriting
was
totally
illegible
to
me
for
a
few
moments
i
was
visited
with
heavy
doubts
and
discomfiture
of
spirit
but
i
had
immediate
recourse
to
prayer
i
closed
the
book
and
implored
that
its
characters
might
be
made
legible
to
me
and
when
i
opened
it
again
the
pages
seemed
to
my
eyes
to
be
as
a
manuscript
of
my
own
this
statement
however
was
not
only
received
with
every
evidence
of
the
most
undoubting
belief
but
an
elderly
clergyman
who
sat
near
the
narrator
exclaimed
with
great
warmth
i
thank
you
sir
i
thank
you
greatly
thompson
for
this
shining
example
of
the
effect
of
ready
piety
and
ready
wit
though
the
cloth
is
removed
sir
i
must
ask
to
drink
a
glass
of
wine
with
you
and
may
heaven
continue
to
you
its
especial
grace
there
were
some
phrases
too
which
though
undoubtedly
sanctioned
by
serious
usage
sounded
strangely
when
used
in
a
scene
apparently
of
such
gay
festivity
one
gentleman
confessed
very
frankly
his
inability
to
resist
taking
more
of
such
wine
as
that
now
set
before
them
than
was
altogether
consistent
with
his
own
strict
ideas
of
ministerial
propriety
but
added
he
though
in
so
yielding
i
am
conscious
of
being
in
some
sort
wrong
i
feel
intimately
persuaded
at
the
same
time
that
by
thus
freely
demonstrating
the
strength
and
power
of
original
sin
within
me
i
am
doing
a
service
to
the
cause
of
religion
by
establishing
one
of
its
most
important
truths
this
apology
was
received
with
universal
applause
it
manifested
as
one
of
the
company
remarked
equal
soundness
of
faith
and
delicacy
of
conscience
one
of
the
most
celebrated
of
the
regular
london
speakers
known
at
all
meetings
throughout
the
whole
evangelical
season
having
silently
emptied
a
bottle
of
claret
which
he
kept
close
to
him
began
just
as
he
had
finished
the
last
glass
to
recover
the
use
of
his
tongue
his
first
words
were
my
king
has
been
paying
me
a
visit
indeed
said
cartwright
whose
attention
was
instantly
roused
by
this
very
interesting
statement
where
was
the
visit
made
mr
white
even
here
sir
replied
white
solemnly
here
since
i
have
been
sitting
silently
at
your
hospitable
board
as
how
sir
inquired
a
certain
sir
william
crompton
who
was
placed
near
him
do
you
mean
that
you
have
been
sleeping
and
that
his
majesty
has
visited
you
in
your
dreams
the
majesty
that
i
speak
of
sir
replied
white
is
the
king
of
heaven
what
other
could
it
be
exclaimed
cartwright
showing
the
whites
of
his
eyes
and
appearing
scandalized
at
the
blunder
i
wonder
cartwright
said
a
young
man
of
decidedly
pious
propensities
but
not
as
yet
considering
himself
quite
assured
of
his
election
i
wonder
cartwright
whether
i
shall
be
saved
or
not
it
is
a
most
interesting
question
my
young
friend
replied
the
vicar
mildly
and
you
really
can
not
pay
too
much
attention
to
it
i
am
happy
to
see
that
it
leaves
you
not
even
at
the
festive
board
and
i
sincerely
hope
it
will
finally
be
settled
to
your
satisfaction
but
as
yet
it
is
impossible
to
decide
i
shall
not
fail
to
ride
over
to
hear
you
preach
excellent
mr
cartwright
said
a
gentleman
of
the
neighbourhood
who
though
not
hitherto
enrolled
in
the
evangelical
calendar
was
so
struck
on
the
present
occasion
with
the
hospitable
entertainment
he
received
that
he
determined
to
cultivate
the
acquaintance
you
do
me
great
honour
sir
replied
the
vicar
if
you
do
i
hope
it
will
be
on
a
day
when
you
can
stay
supper
with
us
you
are
excessively
kind
my
dear
sir
answered
the
guest
but
as
my
place
is
at
least
ten
miles
distant
from
yours
i
fear
if
you
sup
in
the
same
style
that
you
dine
it
would
be
somewhat
late
before
i
got
home
cartwright
bowed
dropped
his
eyes
and
said
nothing
oh
sir
said
hetherington
who
though
he
had
drunk
more
than
any
man
at
table
excepting
the
cousin
corbold
had
as
yet
in
no
degree
lost
his
apprehension
oh
sir
you
quite
mistake
the
supper
that
the
excellent
cartwright
means
is
to
be
taken
at
the
table
of
the
lord
dear
me
exclaimed
the
squire
who
really
meant
to
be
both
civil
and
serious
i
beg
pardon
i
made
a
sad
blunder
indeed
there
is
nothing
sad
but
sin
mr
wilkins
replied
the
vicar
meekly
a
mistake
is
no
sin
even
i
myself
have
sometimes
been
mistaken
what
humility
there
is
in
mr
cartwright
said
hetherington
in
a
loud
whisper
to
his
neighbour
every
day
he
lives
seems
to
elevate
my
idea
of
his
character
is
not
this
claret
admirable
mr
dickson
just
at
this
moment
chivers
the
butler
entered
the
room
and
whispered
something
in
his
master
ear
indeed
exclaimed
cartwright
a
very
disagreeable
accident
upon
my
word
what
is
it
sir
inquired
several
voices
at
once
the
head
cook
gentlemen
replied
chivers
has
fallen
off
the
and
has
put
out
his
shoulder
a
very
disagreeable
accident
indeed
echoed
the
guests
the
butler
whispered
again
certainly
chivers
certainly
i
am
very
glad
bird
the
surgeon
happens
to
be
on
the
premises
let
him
immediately
set
the
joint
and
when
this
is
done
and
the
poor
fellow
laid
comfortably
in
bed
come
for
hetherington
whom
i
will
immediately
order
to
awaken
him
bless
my
soul
sir
exclaimed
the
sir
william
crompton
wo
that
be
rather
injudicious
if
the
poor
fellow
should
get
a
nap
i
should
think
it
would
be
the
worst
thing
in
the
world
to
awaken
him
pardon
me
sir
william
replied
the
vicar
with
great
respect
but
persons
of
the
world
do
not
well
understand
the
language
of
those
who
are
not
of
the
world
no
accident
no
illness
ever
occurs
in
my
house
sir
william
but
my
first
effort
is
to
awaken
the
soul
of
the
sufferer
to
a
proper
sense
of
his
sins
i
always
take
care
they
shall
be
told
that
the
jaws
of
the
tomb
are
opening
before
them
and
that
as
death
comes
like
a
thief
in
the
night
they
should
be
watching
for
him
this
in
the
language
of
a
pious
and
professing
christian
is
called
an
awakening
and
needful
as
it
is
at
all
times
it
is
of
course
more
needful
still
in
sickness
or
danger
of
any
kind
sir
william
crompton
filled
his
glass
with
the
wealthy
vicar
admirable
wine
and
said
no
more
the
time
was
now
approaching
at
which
the
populace
were
to
be
admitted
to
the
tents
on
the
lawn
and
cartwright
having
looked
at
his
watch
rose
and
said
gentlemen
it
is
distressing
to
me
to
be
forced
to
disturb
you
but
the
business
of
the
meeting
requires
that
we
should
all
repair
to
the
lawn
the
populace
are
about
to
be
admitted
and
it
is
expected
that
our
estimable
isaacs
will
benefit
very
considerably
by
the
eagerness
with
which
the
farmers
wives
and
daughters
will
purchase
the
articles
which
remain
of
our
christian
ladies
elegant
handiworks
one
bumper
to
the
success
of
the
reverend
isaac
isaacs
and
to
the
conversion
of
the
people
of
fababo
and
now
we
will
return
to
our
duty
in
the
tents
to
your
tents
o
israel
shouted
a
young
man
with
more
of
wine
than
wit
as
he
turned
towards
the
converted
jew
for
myself
he
added
i
be
d
d
if
i
stir
an
inch
till
i
have
finished
this
bottle
cartwright
stopped
short
in
his
progress
towards
the
door
he
turned
a
glance
more
inquiring
perhaps
than
stern
on
the
face
of
the
intoxicated
speaker
and
perceived
that
he
was
the
nephew
of
an
earl
the
sole
reason
indeed
which
had
procured
him
the
honour
of
a
seat
in
that
distinguished
circle
the
vicar
balanced
for
a
moment
whether
he
should
reprimand
him
or
not
had
he
been
the
son
instead
of
the
nephew
of
the
noble
lord
he
would
certainly
have
passed
on
in
holy
meditation
but
as
it
was
he
stopped
there
were
many
serious
eyes
upon
him
notwithstanding
the
claret
he
remembered
that
the
earl
had
a
goodly
progeny
and
that
consequently
his
nephew
would
never
be
likely
to
succeed
to
his
title
and
therefore
with
great
dignity
and
much
pious
solemnity
he
thus
addressed
his
curate
who
in
his
capacity
of
domestic
chaplain
was
ever
near
him
hetherington
you
have
heard
the
awful
words
spoken
by
augustus
mappleton
remember
sir
that
his
repentance
and
conversion
be
prayed
for
at
our
concluding
service
this
evening
and
also
in
your
extempore
prayer
before
sermon
on
next
sabbath
morning
these
words
had
a
very
sobering
effect
on
the
company
and
the
whole
party
made
all
things
considered
a
very
orderly
exit
from
the
not
however
without
cartwright
finding
an
opportunity
of
whispering
in
the
ear
of
his
cousin
now
is
your
time
stephen
to
go
into
the
chapter
xi
the
elopement
when
the
gentlemen
reached
the
lawn
they
found
it
already
covered
not
only
with
the
company
from
all
the
other
rooms
but
likewise
with
crowds
of
people
from
the
park
who
came
rushing
in
through
different
entrances
from
all
quarters
in
the
midst
of
all
this
bustle
and
confusion
however
cartwright
remembered
his
engagement
with
stephen
corbold
and
only
waiting
till
he
saw
that
the
servants
of
his
house
were
among
the
throng
he
sought
cartwright
and
finding
as
he
expected
her
daughter
close
beside
her
whispered
in
her
ear
oblige
me
dearest
clara
by
sending
helen
to
your
for
a
small
packet
of
very
important
papers
which
i
left
on
the
i
can
not
go
myself
and
there
is
not
a
servant
to
be
found
cartwright
immediately
spoke
the
command
to
helen
and
the
vicar
had
the
satisfaction
of
watching
her
make
her
way
through
the
crowd
and
enter
the
window
of
the
poor
helen
was
not
happy
enough
to
have
enjoyed
in
any
degree
the
splendid
bustle
of
the
day
and
the
total
repose
and
silence
of
the
house
was
quite
refreshing
to
her
she
passed
through
the
into
the
hall
from
whence
not
even
the
loud
buzz
of
the
multitude
without
could
reach
her
and
untying
her
bonnet
and
throwing
that
and
her
scarf
on
a
slab
she
sat
down
to
enjoy
for
a
few
moments
the
cool
quiet
of
the
lofty
silent
room
at
length
she
reluctantly
rose
to
perform
her
mother
bidding
walked
slowly
and
languidly
up
the
stairs
along
the
spacious
corridor
and
into
cartwright
this
little
apartment
was
no
longer
the
dear
familiar
scene
of
maternal
fondness
that
it
once
was
or
helen
might
here
again
have
been
tempted
to
sit
down
for
the
enjoyment
of
temporary
repose
but
in
truth
she
no
longer
loved
that
and
walking
straight
to
the
she
took
the
packet
she
found
there
and
turned
to
retrace
her
steps
it
was
with
a
start
of
disagreeable
surprise
though
hardly
of
alarm
that
she
saw
stephen
corbold
standing
between
her
and
the
door
the
persevering
impertinence
of
his
addresses
had
long
ago
obliged
her
to
decline
all
communication
with
him
and
it
was
therefore
without
appearing
to
notice
him
that
she
now
pursued
her
way
towards
the
door
but
hardly
had
she
made
a
step
towards
it
when
the
odious
wretch
enclosed
her
in
his
arms
she
uttered
a
loud
shriek
and
by
a
violent
effort
disengaged
herself
but
ere
she
could
reach
the
door
he
had
closed
locked
it
and
put
the
key
in
his
pocket
a
dreadful
sensation
of
terror
now
seized
upon
her
yet
even
then
she
remembered
that
she
was
in
her
mother
house
and
a
feeling
of
confidence
returned
you
are
intoxicated
sir
said
she
drawing
back
from
him
towards
the
bell
but
you
surely
can
not
be
so
mad
as
to
insult
me
here
i
will
insult
you
nowhere
miss
helen
if
you
will
behave
as
you
ought
to
do
to
the
man
whom
heaven
hath
chosen
for
your
husband
but
as
for
your
ringing
the
bell
or
screeching
either
i
fairly
tell
you
at
once
it
is
of
no
use
there
is
not
a
single
human
being
left
in
the
house
but
our
two
selves
so
you
may
as
well
give
me
satisfaction
at
once
and
promise
to
marry
me
without
more
trouble
or
else
i
will
make
you
thankful
for
the
same
without
my
ever
asking
you
again
open
that
door
sir
and
let
me
out
instantly
said
helen
pale
as
death
yet
still
not
believing
that
the
monster
before
her
would
dare
to
attempt
any
outrage
even
cartwright
she
added
would
resent
any
impertinence
offered
to
me
under
my
mother
roof
let
me
pass
sir
believe
me
you
had
better
believe
me
i
had
better
not
miss
helen
you
have
been
playing
the
fool
with
me
long
enough
and
as
to
my
cousin
cartwright
he
is
quite
of
the
same
opinion
i
assure
you
charming
helen
he
exclaimed
again
stretching
out
his
arms
to
enclose
her
be
only
half
as
kind
as
you
are
beautiful
and
we
shall
be
the
happiest
couple
in
the
world
at
least
sir
you
must
let
me
consult
my
mother
about
it
said
helen
contriving
to
keep
the
table
between
them
and
believing
that
he
was
there
only
in
consequence
of
his
being
intoxicated
let
me
ask
my
mother
consent
mr
corbold
corbold
laughed
aloud
you
think
me
tipsy
my
sweet
girl
but
if
i
am
trust
me
it
no
more
than
just
to
give
me
courage
to
teach
you
your
duty
my
charming
helen
let
go
the
table
and
understand
the
thing
at
once
my
cousin
cartwright
is
under
some
obligations
to
me
and
he
means
to
settle
them
all
by
giving
me
a
pretty
fortune
with
you
and
as
he
knows
that
unhappily
you
are
not
converted
as
yet
and
have
shown
yourself
not
over
in
return
for
my
love
it
is
he
himself
who
invented
this
scheme
of
having
you
sent
up
here
when
all
the
servants
were
out
of
the
house
and
of
my
being
here
ready
to
meet
you
and
to
teach
you
your
duty
to
him
and
to
your
mother
and
to
your
heavenly
father
and
to
me
and
so
now
you
know
all
and
every
thing
and
i
have
got
the
key
of
the
room
in
my
and
will
you
consent
to
be
my
wife
beginning
from
this
very
minute
dreadful
as
helen
terror
was
her
senses
did
not
leave
her
on
the
contrary
all
the
strength
of
her
mind
seemed
to
be
roused
and
her
faculties
sharpened
by
the
peril
that
beset
her
she
doubted
not
for
a
moment
that
his
statement
respecting
cartwright
part
in
this
villany
was
true
and
that
she
was
indeed
left
in
the
power
of
this
detested
being
with
no
help
but
the
protection
of
heaven
and
her
own
courage
she
fixed
her
eye
steadily
on
that
of
corbold
and
perceived
that
as
he
talked
the
look
of
intoxication
increased
she
therefore
skilfully
prolonged
the
conversation
by
asking
him
if
indeed
she
must
be
his
wife
where
they
were
to
live
whether
her
sister
fanny
might
live
with
them
whether
he
ever
meant
to
take
her
to
london
and
the
like
contriving
as
she
did
so
to
push
the
table
which
still
continued
between
them
in
such
a
direction
as
to
leave
her
between
it
and
the
door
of
her
mother
corbold
was
evidently
losing
his
head
and
appeared
aware
of
it
for
he
stopped
short
in
his
replies
and
professions
of
passionate
love
that
he
was
making
and
exclaiming
with
an
oath
that
he
would
be
trifled
with
no
longer
he
suddenly
thrust
the
table
from
between
them
and
again
threw
his
arms
round
waist
she
was
not
however
wholly
unprepared
to
receive
him
on
first
approaching
the
table
that
had
hitherto
befriended
her
she
perceived
on
it
a
large
vial
of
spirits
of
hartshorn
this
she
had
taken
possession
of
and
held
firmly
in
her
hand
and
at
the
moment
that
corbold
bent
his
audacious
head
to
kiss
her
she
discharged
the
whole
contents
upon
his
eyes
and
face
occasioning
a
degree
of
blindness
and
suffocation
that
for
the
moment
totally
disabled
him
he
screamed
with
the
sudden
pain
and
raised
his
hands
to
his
tortured
eyes
before
he
removed
them
helen
had
already
passed
through
her
mother
and
was
flying
by
a
back
staircase
to
the
servants
room
below
without
waiting
to
see
if
she
were
pursued
she
opened
a
back
door
that
led
into
the
and
after
a
moment
consideration
proceeded
across
it
into
a
lane
which
led
in
one
direction
to
the
kitchen
gardens
and
in
the
other
into
the
road
to
oakley
even
at
that
moment
helen
had
time
to
remember
that
if
she
turned
her
steps
towards
the
kitchen
gardens
she
should
pass
by
a
park
gate
which
would
immediately
lead
her
to
all
the
safety
that
the
protection
of
an
assembled
multitude
could
give
but
she
remembered
also
that
in
a
few
hours
she
should
again
be
left
in
the
hands
of
cartwright
and
inwardly
uttering
a
solemn
vow
that
nothing
should
ever
again
make
her
wilfully
submit
to
this
she
darted
forward
unmindful
of
her
uncovered
head
and
with
a
degree
of
speed
more
proportioned
to
her
agitation
than
her
strength
pursued
the
short
cut
across
the
fields
to
oakley
and
entering
the
grounds
by
the
gate
which
led
to
the
lawn
perceived
sir
gilbert
lady
harrington
and
their
son
seated
on
a
garden
bench
under
the
shelter
of
a
widely
spreading
helen
knew
that
she
was
now
safe
and
she
relaxed
her
speed
slowly
and
with
tottering
steps
approaching
the
friends
from
whom
notwithstanding
their
long
estrangement
her
heart
anticipated
a
warm
and
tender
welcome
yet
they
did
not
rise
to
meet
her
perhaps
thought
she
they
do
not
know
me
and
it
was
then
she
recollected
that
her
hair
was
hanging
dishevelled
about
her
face
without
hat
or
cap
to
shelter
it
she
was
greatly
heated
and
her
breath
and
strength
barely
sufficed
to
bring
her
within
a
few
yards
of
the
party
when
totally
exhausted
she
sat
down
upon
the
turf
and
burst
into
tears
colonel
harrington
had
not
written
the
letter
to
helen
which
the
vicar
of
wrexhill
destroyed
without
having
put
both
his
parents
in
his
confidence
lady
harrington
fond
affection
for
her
which
her
enforced
absence
had
in
no
degree
lessened
rendered
the
avowal
of
her
son
attachment
a
matter
of
unmixed
joy
and
though
sir
gilbert
declared
that
he
would
as
soon
stand
in
the
relation
of
brother
to
his
satanic
majesty
as
to
cartwright
he
at
length
gave
his
apparently
sulky
consent
with
perhaps
as
much
real
pleasure
as
his
lady
herself
both
the
one
and
the
other
however
knew
perfectly
well
that
their
son
would
have
been
an
excellent
match
for
helen
even
when
her
father
was
alive
and
would
as
it
was
supposed
have
given
her
a
fortune
of
forty
thousand
pounds
and
they
felt
some
degree
of
triumph
neither
unamiable
nor
ungenerous
in
its
nature
at
the
idea
of
securing
to
one
at
least
of
poor
mowbray
family
a
station
in
society
that
not
even
their
connexion
with
cartwright
could
tarnish
the
whole
family
understood
the
position
of
things
at
the
park
too
well
to
be
surprised
at
no
answer
being
sent
express
to
colonel
letter
and
the
following
post
was
waited
for
with
pleasurable
though
impatient
anxiety
but
when
it
arrived
without
bringing
any
answer
and
another
and
another
followed
with
no
notice
taken
of
a
proposal
of
marriage
which
as
sir
gilbert
said
the
proudest
woman
in
england
might
have
been
glad
to
accept
the
misery
of
the
young
man
himself
and
the
anger
and
indignation
of
his
parents
were
about
equally
vehement
considering
the
opinion
entertained
by
sir
gilbert
of
what
he
was
pleased
to
term
cartwright
finished
character
it
is
surprising
that
no
idea
should
even
have
occurred
to
him
of
the
possible
suppression
of
this
important
epistle
but
in
truth
the
same
interpretation
of
it
had
suggested
itself
to
the
minds
of
them
all
they
believed
that
helen
from
a
sense
of
duty
had
submitted
the
proposal
to
her
mother
and
that
forbidden
to
accept
it
by
the
vindictive
feelings
of
the
parvenu
priest
she
had
been
weak
enough
to
obey
even
his
commands
to
leave
the
letter
unanswered
a
degree
of
timidity
and
want
of
proper
feeling
productive
of
almost
equal
disappointment
to
all
three
impressed
with
such
feelings
against
her
it
is
perhaps
not
very
surprising
that
neither
the
lover
nor
his
offended
parents
rose
to
welcome
the
approach
of
poor
helen
some
family
quarrel
i
suppose
said
lady
harrington
they
seem
to
have
turned
her
out
of
doors
in
some
haste
i
will
promise
her
that
she
shall
not
now
find
an
entrance
into
mine
said
sir
gilbert
perhaps
the
young
lady
thinks
better
of
it
and
that
it
may
be
as
well
to
contradict
pa
and
ma
a
little
for
the
sake
of
being
harrington
those
who
will
not
when
they
may
when
they
will
they
shall
have
but
before
sir
gilbert
could
finish
his
stave
helen
mowbray
was
stretched
upon
the
turf
colonel
harrington
not
too
well
knowing
what
he
did
ran
to
the
spot
where
she
lay
and
hardly
daring
to
look
at
her
stammered
out
miss
mowbray
gracious
heaven
how
fearfully
she
changes
colour
so
red
and
now
so
deadly
pale
speak
to
me
helen
what
has
happened
to
you
how
comes
it
that
you
are
here
after
oh
helen
open
your
eyes
and
speak
to
me
mother
mother
she
is
very
ill
lady
harrington
now
rose
slowly
and
gloomily
from
her
seat
and
walked
to
the
place
where
helen
lay
her
head
supported
by
the
arm
of
colonel
harrington
every
tinge
of
colour
fled
from
her
cheeks
her
eyes
closed
and
no
symptom
of
life
remaining
excepting
that
tears
from
time
to
time
escaped
from
beneath
her
long
eyelashes
it
is
difficult
to
see
a
person
one
has
ever
loved
asleep
and
yet
retain
anger
towards
them
they
look
so
helpless
so
innocent
so
free
from
all
that
could
have
ever
moved
our
spleen
that
not
the
most
eloquent
defence
that
language
ever
framed
could
plead
their
cause
so
well
as
that
mute
slumber
still
more
difficult
would
it
be
to
look
at
a
fair
creature
in
the
state
in
which
helen
now
lay
and
retain
any
feeling
harsher
than
pity
there
is
something
more
in
all
this
william
than
we
yet
understand
said
lady
harrington
after
gazing
silently
at
helen
for
some
minutes
this
poor
child
has
not
fainted
her
tears
prove
that
but
she
is
suffering
from
bodily
fatigue
and
mental
helen
rouse
yourself
let
us
understand
each
other
at
once
why
did
you
not
reply
to
my
son
william
letter
helen
did
rouse
herself
she
opened
her
eyes
and
fixing
them
on
lady
harrington
while
the
colour
for
a
moment
rapidly
revisited
her
cheeks
she
said
in
a
voice
so
low
as
to
be
scarcely
audible
a
letter
from
colonel
harrington
to
me
a
letter
to
me
i
never
received
it
thank
heaven
cried
colonel
harrington
springing
from
the
ground
for
helen
head
no
longer
rested
on
his
arm
oh
what
suffering
should
we
have
been
spared
if
we
had
done
her
but
the
justice
to
think
of
this
he
hastily
returned
to
his
father
who
though
he
had
not
advanced
a
step
had
risen
from
his
seat
and
to
do
him
justice
was
looking
towards
helen
with
great
anxiety
she
never
received
it
sir
said
he
in
a
voice
husky
from
agitation
oh
come
to
her
soothe
her
with
kindness
my
dearest
father
and
all
may
yet
be
happiness
amongst
us
what
helen
helen
my
poor
girl
are
you
come
to
us
with
some
new
trouble
and
did
you
indeed
never
get
william
letter
my
dear
child
the
mention
of
such
a
letter
again
dyed
helen
cheeks
with
blushes
but
she
raised
her
eyes
to
sir
gilbert
face
with
a
look
that
seemed
to
ask
a
thousand
questions
as
she
replied
i
never
received
any
letter
from
colonel
harrington
in
my
life
i
am
devilish
glad
to
hear
it
my
dear
that
all
so
then
you
know
that
hold
your
peace
sir
knight
said
lady
harrington
interrupting
and
you
come
with
me
sweet
love
i
lay
my
best
herbal
to
that
dead
leaf
that
you
are
the
only
one
perfectly
faultless
among
us
and
that
one
two
and
three
of
us
deserve
to
be
i
can
hardly
tell
what
in
the
power
of
the
vicar
i
think
for
having
been
so
villanous
as
to
suspect
you
and
worse
still
for
having
lived
so
close
to
you
without
ever
having
found
out
whether
you
were
really
watched
like
a
state
prisoner
or
not
has
the
rascal
dared
cried
sir
gilbert
but
before
he
could
finish
his
sentence
lady
harrington
and
her
son
were
leading
helen
between
them
towards
the
house
her
ladyship
laying
a
finger
on
her
lip
as
she
passed
her
husband
in
token
that
he
was
to
say
no
more
having
reached
what
lady
harrington
called
a
place
of
safety
where
as
she
said
the
men
could
neither
come
nor
hear
she
made
helen
lay
herself
upon
a
sofa
and
then
said
now
my
helen
if
you
are
ill
at
ease
in
body
lay
there
quiet
and
try
to
sleep
but
if
you
are
only
or
chiefly
ill
at
ease
in
mind
let
your
limbs
only
remain
at
rest
and
relieve
yourself
and
me
by
telling
me
every
thing
that
has
happened
since
we
parted
last
it
is
a
long
and
sad
history
my
dearest
friend
replied
helen
kissing
the
hand
which
still
held
hers
but
i
am
very
anxious
that
you
should
know
it
all
for
so
only
can
the
action
i
have
committed
be
excused
what
action
helen
what
is
it
you
have
done
my
child
i
have
eloped
from
my
mother
house
lady
harrington
but
you
have
eloped
alone
helen
yes
alone
well
then
my
dear
i
will
give
you
absolution
for
that
perhaps
there
are
those
among
us
who
may
not
find
it
so
easy
to
absolve
you
from
all
blame
for
not
doing
it
before
but
now
for
will
you
have
a
glass
of
water
helen
mercy
on
me
i
believe
it
must
be
a
glass
of
wine
what
can
you
have
got
to
tell
you
change
colour
every
moment
my
dear
child
helen
narrative
however
being
of
necessity
less
full
then
that
contained
in
the
preceding
pages
need
not
be
repeated
it
was
given
indeed
with
all
the
force
and
simplicity
of
truth
and
deep
feeling
and
told
all
she
knew
of
cartwright
plans
and
projects
but
excepting
what
she
had
that
day
learned
during
her
dreadful
interview
with
corbold
she
had
little
to
add
to
what
lady
harrington
knew
before
this
interview
however
was
itself
fully
enough
to
justify
the
elopement
of
which
helen
still
spoke
with
such
dismay
and
together
with
the
fact
again
asked
for
and
again
repeated
that
no
letter
from
colonel
harrington
had
reached
her
hands
was
sufficient
to
make
her
ladyship
burst
forth
into
a
passion
of
indignation
against
the
vicar
of
wrexhill
and
to
make
her
while
overpowering
helen
with
the
tenderest
caresses
bless
her
again
and
again
for
having
at
last
flown
to
seek
shelter
where
it
would
be
given
with
such
heartfelt
joy
soothed
consoled
and
almost
happy
as
helen
was
made
by
this
recovered
kindness
her
anxiety
to
know
why
and
upon
what
subject
colonel
harrington
could
have
written
to
her
was
becoming
every
moment
more
powerful
there
was
something
so
very
fond
so
very
maternal
in
lady
harrington
manner
to
her
something
that
seemed
to
say
that
she
was
of
more
consequence
to
her
now
than
she
had
ever
been
before
something
in
short
quite
indescribable
but
which
gave
birth
to
such
delicious
hopes
in
the
breast
of
helen
that
she
almost
feared
to
meet
the
eye
of
the
old
lady
lest
all
she
guessed
and
all
she
wished
should
be
read
in
her
own
it
is
possible
that
with
all
the
care
she
took
to
avoid
the
betraying
this
anxiety
she
did
not
succeed
for
in
answer
to
some
very
delicate
and
very
distant
hint
that
it
was
extremely
disagreeable
to
have
letters
intercepted
lady
harrington
though
she
only
replied
yes
it
is
helen
rose
and
left
the
room
only
adding
as
she
closed
the
door
keep
yourself
quiet
my
dear
child
i
shall
return
to
you
presently
presently
is
a
word
that
certainly
appears
by
common
usage
to
admit
of
very
considerable
variety
of
interpretation
and
it
was
evident
that
on
the
present
occasion
the
two
parties
between
whom
it
passed
understood
it
differently
long
before
lady
harrington
again
appeared
helen
felt
persuaded
that
some
important
circumstance
must
have
occurred
to
make
her
so
completely
change
her
purpose
yet
the
good
lady
herself
when
she
the
room
looked
and
was
perfectly
unconscious
of
having
made
any
delay
at
all
inconsistent
with
her
presently
she
held
a
folded
paper
in
her
hand
you
have
not
asked
me
helen
she
said
on
what
subject
it
was
that
my
son
wrote
to
you
and
yet
i
suspect
that
you
have
some
wish
to
know
i
have
been
down
stairs
to
consult
him
on
the
best
mode
of
repairing
your
precious
treachery
and
he
suggested
my
putting
into
your
hands
the
copy
of
the
letter
which
has
been
so
basely
intercepted
which
copy
it
seems
has
remained
safely
in
his
desk
while
its
original
has
probably
fed
the
flames
in
cartwright
secret
chamber
kindling
thereby
a
sympathetic
and
very
consuming
fire
in
the
breast
of
the
writer
helen
stretched
forth
a
very
trembling
hand
to
receive
the
paper
her
eyes
were
fixed
upon
it
either
to
read
through
its
enclosure
the
characters
within
or
to
avoid
at
that
moment
meeting
the
eye
of
her
godmother
i
shall
leave
you
my
love
to
peruse
it
alone
and
presently
when
i
think
you
have
done
so
will
return
to
ask
if
you
can
not
in
some
degree
comprehend
what
must
have
been
felt
at
its
not
obtaining
an
answer
having
said
this
lady
harrington
retired
without
waiting
for
a
reply
and
leaving
helen
unable
for
a
moment
to
learn
what
her
heart
throbbed
with
such
violence
to
know
the
letter
of
which
helen
now
held
the
copy
has
been
already
presented
to
the
reader
and
if
she
chance
to
be
one
of
helen
age
having
at
her
heart
a
love
unbreathed
to
any
human
ear
she
may
guess
what
my
feelings
were
at
finding
such
love
had
met
an
equal
an
acknowledged
return
such
a
one
may
guess
helen
feelings
but
no
other
can
lady
harrington
now
seemed
to
helen
as
much
shorter
than
it
really
was
as
the
last
had
seemed
longer
she
had
read
the
letter
but
four
times
through
and
pressed
it
to
her
heart
kissed
it
and
so
forth
not
half
so
much
as
she
desired
and
it
deserved
when
a
knock
was
heard
at
the
door
and
the
old
lady
again
entered
the
happy
but
agitated
girl
stood
up
to
receive
her
and
though
she
spoke
not
a
single
word
the
manner
in
which
she
rushed
into
her
maternal
arms
and
hid
her
face
upon
her
bosom
spoke
plainly
enough
that
the
gallant
colonel
had
no
reason
to
despair
what
must
he
have
thought
of
me
were
helen
first
words
and
you
and
sir
gilbert
such
a
letter
dearest
dearest
lady
harrington
you
could
not
really
think
i
had
ever
received
it
you
have
struck
the
right
chord
there
my
helen
we
all
deserve
to
have
suffered
ten
thousand
times
more
than
we
have
done
for
having
for
a
moment
believed
it
possible
you
should
have
received
that
letter
and
not
invented
some
means
to
answer
it
let
the
answer
be
what
it
might
and
this
answer
you
have
not
yet
told
me
what
it
is
to
be
i
do
not
know
how
much
or
how
little
you
may
happen
to
like
william
my
dear
but
in
case
you
should
have
no
insuperable
aversion
to
him
the
business
is
made
delightfully
easy
by
this
adventure
the
elopement
is
done
and
over
already
helen
only
pressed
lady
harrington
hand
to
her
heart
but
said
nothing
yes
you
have
found
the
way
to
let
me
into
your
secret
without
speaking
this
little
heart
throbs
violently
enough
to
prevent
any
suspicion
of
indifference
but
what
am
i
to
say
to
my
impatient
hero
below
that
you
will
or
you
wo
marry
him
as
soon
as
the
lawyers
will
let
you
oh
lady
harrington
come
down
stairs
my
dear
you
had
better
come
down
i
do
assure
you
for
i
expect
sir
gilbert
will
be
up
in
a
moment
and
you
can
not
suppose
that
william
will
remain
behind
and
my
would
by
no
means
be
so
dignified
a
scene
for
the
denouement
as
the
great
saloon
come
dear
come
and
helen
went
trembling
blushing
with
tears
in
her
eyes
and
such
palpitation
at
her
heart
that
she
was
very
sure
she
could
not
pronounce
a
word
but
what
need
was
there
of
words
the
happy
colonel
was
soon
perfectly
satisfied
and
thanked
her
on
his
bended
knee
for
a
consent
more
looked
than
spoken
even
sir
gilbert
himself
though
singularly
attached
to
plain
speaking
seemed
well
content
on
the
present
occasion
to
dispense
with
it
and
pressed
helen
to
his
heart
and
kissed
her
forehead
and
called
her
his
dear
daughter
apparently
with
as
much
satisfaction
as
if
she
had
declared
herself
ready
to
accept
of
his
son
in
the
very
best
arranged
words
ever
spoken
upon
such
an
occasion
when
the
first
few
decisive
moments
were
past
and
each
one
of
the
party
felt
that
all
things
were
settled
or
about
to
be
settled
in
exact
conformity
to
their
most
inward
and
earnest
desires
and
when
helen
was
placed
as
the
centre
of
the
six
loving
and
admiring
eyes
that
were
fixed
upon
her
she
closed
her
own
but
it
was
neither
to
faint
nor
to
sleep
but
to
meditate
for
a
moment
with
the
more
intensity
upon
the
miraculous
change
wrought
in
her
destiny
within
the
last
few
hours
what
are
you
thinking
of
my
helen
said
the
colonel
jealous
as
it
should
seem
of
losing
sight
of
those
dear
eyes
even
for
a
moment
i
am
endeavouring
to
believe
that
it
is
all
real
replied
helen
with
beautiful
simplicity
bless
you
my
darling
child
said
the
rough
baronet
greatly
touched
what
an
old
villain
i
have
been
to
you
helen
abusing
you
hating
you
calling
you
all
manner
of
hard
names
and
your
little
heart
as
true
as
steel
all
the
time
real
real
that
you
are
beloved
by
me
helen
cried
colonel
harrington
absolutely
forgetting
that
he
was
not
with
his
fair
mistress
and
how
is
she
to
answer
him
with
you
and
me
peering
in
her
face
my
lady
ought
we
not
to
be
ashamed
of
ourselves
come
along
this
moment
very
well
i
will
go
but
only
upon
one
condition
helen
remember
william
she
is
to
indulge
in
no
disagreeable
reminiscences
and
no
melancholy
anticipations
but
look
just
as
beautiful
and
as
happy
when
i
come
back
as
she
does
now
this
farewell
advice
was
not
thrown
away
for
it
assisted
colonel
harrington
to
baffle
or
to
banish
all
the
fears
and
regrets
respecting
her
mother
displeasure
at
her
conduct
which
came
like
a
cloud
across
the
bright
perspective
of
helen
hopes
for
the
future
her
lover
showed
himself
indeed
sufficiently
adroit
both
in
turning
to
account
all
the
favourable
circumstances
attending
their
sudden
engagement
and
in
using
his
mother
authority
to
prevent
her
dwelling
upon
what
was
unfavourable
might
not
a
second
home
he
asked
be
of
great
advantage
both
to
fanny
and
miss
torrington
might
not
the
connexion
tend
to
keep
cartwright
in
order
and
prevent
his
finally
injuring
charles
and
lastly
did
she
not
think
it
would
give
pleasure
to
that
charles
himself
to
lady
harrington
helen
had
frankly
recounted
the
history
of
hateful
persecution
from
its
first
beginning
in
london
to
the
fearful
outrage
it
had
led
to
on
that
eventful
day
but
she
had
begged
her
to
repeat
no
more
of
it
to
sir
gilbert
and
the
colonel
than
might
be
sufficient
to
render
her
running
away
intelligible
and
this
request
having
been
strictly
complied
with
for
lady
harrington
seemed
as
unwilling
as
helen
to
trust
her
with
this
history
colonel
harrington
in
conversing
with
her
on
all
she
had
felt
and
suffered
since
her
mother
marriage
spoke
of
him
only
as
a
presumptuous
man
who
had
dared
to
persevere
in
addressing
her
after
she
had
refused
him
it
was
probably
the
heightened
colour
of
helen
as
she
listened
to
this
mention
of
his
name
that
excited
a
greater
degree
of
interest
and
curiosity
concerning
him
than
her
lover
had
at
first
bestowed
upon
him
were
these
hateful
addresses
repeated
by
letter
or
in
person
helen
said
he
fixing
his
eyes
upon
her
agitated
face
in
person
in
person
answered
helen
impatiently
did
your
mother
know
helen
how
greatly
these
addresses
annoyed
you
i
have
often
attempted
to
tell
her
but
she
has
always
evaded
the
subject
telling
me
strangely
enough
and
heaven
knows
not
very
correctly
that
it
was
plain
i
did
not
know
my
own
mind
or
else
that
i
was
guilty
of
affectation
your
mother
then
helen
would
have
approved
of
this
man
addresses
i
fear
so
it
was
then
to
avoid
her
importunity
that
you
left
her
house
helen
looked
uneasy
and
distressed
under
this
questioning
but
answered
no
colonel
harrington
not
her
importunity
but
his
own
the
blood
mounted
to
the
young
soldier
face
and
an
angry
glance
shot
from
his
eye
as
if
he
suspected
something
approaching
but
at
great
distance
to
the
truth
he
surely
did
not
dare
to
be
impertinent
helen
you
have
not
told
me
all
you
came
here
in
a
state
of
dreadful
agitation
tell
me
i
conjure
you
all
that
has
happened
to
you
will
not
helen
what
am
i
to
think
of
this
that
you
have
been
insulted
in
a
manner
that
you
will
not
repeat
to
your
affianced
husband
for
heaven
sake
put
an
end
to
this
torture
i
must
know
all
your
mother
does
know
all
colonel
harrington
make
me
not
repeat
the
hateful
history
again
will
you
refer
me
to
my
mother
will
you
permit
me
to
tell
her
that
you
have
done
so
why
colonel
harrington
replied
helen
should
you
wish
to
know
more
than
i
have
told
you
but
of
course
i
can
not
object
to
your
knowing
all
that
has
passed
between
us
only
i
think
he
does
not
deserve
the
trouble
you
take
in
speaking
of
him
much
to
the
surprise
of
sir
gilbert
and
his
lady
who
were
very
amiably
undergoing
a
real
penance
by
absenting
themselves
from
the
sight
of
happiness
which
touched
them
so
nearly
colonel
harrington
was
seen
hurrying
towards
them
where
they
were
beguiling
the
time
as
they
could
by
inhaling
the
cool
breath
of
evening
under
the
take
a
turn
with
me
mother
will
you
said
he
in
a
voice
not
quite
so
gay
as
they
expected
to
hear
from
him
lady
harrington
immediately
rose
and
passing
her
arm
under
his
they
walked
off
together
at
a
rapid
pace
to
a
distant
walk
mother
he
said
stopping
short
and
looking
earnestly
in
her
face
tell
me
i
beseech
you
every
thing
that
you
have
learnt
from
helen
respecting
that
wretch
corbold
for
some
reason
or
other
which
i
can
not
understand
she
is
averse
to
entering
upon
the
subject
with
me
but
she
assures
me
that
you
know
every
thing
that
has
passed
and
she
has
authorized
my
asking
you
for
the
particulars
has
she
william
then
she
is
a
silly
girl
for
her
pains
but
it
is
your
fault
i
dare
say
you
have
been
tormenting
her
with
about
a
vulgar
villain
that
neither
of
you
ought
ever
again
to
call
to
remembrance
say
no
more
about
him
or
his
precious
cousin
either
surely
we
can
find
more
agreeable
subjects
to
talk
about
than
the
vicar
and
his
cousin
very
likely
mother
but
i
can
not
be
easy
till
i
know
exactly
what
it
was
which
caused
helen
to
leave
her
mother
house
in
the
manner
she
did
this
afternoon
have
i
not
a
right
to
inquire
can
you
blame
me
for
doing
so
no
my
dear
william
i
do
not
but
heavily
shall
i
blame
you
if
you
make
an
extorted
confidence
the
source
of
quarrel
between
an
officer
of
rank
in
his
majesty
service
and
a
pettifogging
methodist
attorney
of
wrexhill
is
it
possible
mother
that
you
know
me
so
little
as
to
think
there
can
exist
the
slightest
chance
of
my
doing
this
pray
do
not
keep
me
in
this
fever
for
the
sake
of
protecting
me
from
a
duel
with
stephen
corbold
there
you
are
your
father
own
son
beyond
all
question
now
listen
then
to
this
infamous
story
and
take
care
that
you
do
not
renew
a
sorrow
that
is
past
by
improperly
resenting
it
after
this
preface
lady
harrington
ventured
to
repeat
to
her
son
the
narrative
she
had
heard
from
helen
he
listened
with
very
exemplary
tranquillity
only
occasionally
biting
his
lips
but
uttering
no
single
word
of
any
kind
till
it
was
concluded
he
then
said
very
quietly
let
us
return
to
poor
helen
how
admirably
has
she
behaved
throughout
lady
harrington
looked
up
into
her
son
face
as
if
to
discover
whether
his
calmness
were
genuine
but
his
pocket
handkerchief
at
that
moment
concealed
his
features
and
as
he
walked
rapidly
towards
the
house
she
could
only
take
it
for
granted
that
all
was
right
and
follow
him
having
reached
the
door
of
the
room
where
he
had
left
helen
he
opened
it
but
waited
outside
till
his
mother
overtook
him
go
to
her
mother
said
he
and
confess
that
you
have
told
me
every
thing
i
would
rather
you
did
this
than
me
tell
her
too
that
she
has
behaved
gloriously
and
when
i
think
you
have
put
her
at
her
ease
about
me
i
will
come
to
you
so
saying
he
passed
on
and
entered
a
small
parlour
that
was
called
his
own
at
the
front
of
the
house
sir
gilbert
soon
followed
his
lady
and
without
going
again
over
the
disagreeable
narrative
at
length
the
whole
business
was
made
sufficiently
intelligible
to
the
baronet
to
make
him
extol
in
high
terms
the
courage
and
presence
of
mind
of
his
future
daughter
this
occupied
a
quarter
of
an
hour
excellently
well
but
still
the
colonel
came
not
and
helen
though
with
no
feeling
of
alarm
certainly
kept
her
eye
upon
the
door
with
more
steadiness
than
she
was
herself
aware
of
at
length
lady
harrington
began
to
show
evident
symptoms
of
that
state
of
mind
usually
called
fidgeting
she
rang
the
bell
and
asked
if
the
colonel
were
at
home
the
servant
did
not
know
tea
was
ordered
and
when
it
came
the
same
question
was
repeated
but
the
same
answer
was
not
given
for
the
man
said
that
the
colonel
had
been
seen
to
go
out
about
half
an
hour
ago
who
saw
him
go
john
said
her
ladyship
did
you
no
my
lady
it
was
the
colonel
own
groom
send
him
here
the
groom
came
and
was
questioned
as
to
how
and
when
he
had
seen
his
master
go
out
i
was
in
the
my
lady
and
the
colonel
came
in
and
took
down
one
after
another
all
the
coachman
whips
from
the
pegs
and
at
last
my
lady
he
chose
the
newest
and
the
stoutest
and
carried
it
away
with
him
but
he
said
never
a

sir
gilbert
with
very
considerable
continuity
of
sound
that

do

you
may
go
and
so
his
colonelship
is
gone
forth
with
the
stoutest
and
the
best

he
could
find
well
upon
my
word
i
do
not
think
he
could
have
done
better
foolish
boy
exclaimed
lady
harrington
he
will
get
into
some
abominable
scrape
or
other
yes
my
lady
he
will
horsewhip
the
lawyer
you
may
depend
upon
it
and
then
he
will
have
damages
to
pay
but
for
an
only
son
william
is
far
from
extravagant
and
i
really
do
feel
inclined
to
begrudge
him
this
little
amusement
nor
i
either

takes
care
not

be
done
depend
upon
it

chapter
xii
corbold
adventures
it
was
some
time
before
stephen
corbold
recovered
sufficiently
from
the
effects
of
helen
libation
to
enable
him
to
see
where
he
was
or
to
perceive
that
where
he
was
she
was
not
the
ceremony
had
indeed
been
a
painful
one
but
it
at
least
did
him
the
good
service
of
dispelling
the
effects
of
the
wine
he
had
taken
and
after
a
few
moments
more
of
winking
and
blinking
and
wiping
his
smarting
eyes
he
descended
the
stairs
to
seek
his
cousin
a
soberer
if
not
a
better
man
than
when
he
mounted
them
every
thing
was
at
this
time
in
full
activity
on
the
lawn
above
two
thousand
people
were
assembled
there
all
more
more
than
decently
clad
and
presenting
altogether
a
very
striking
spectacle
those
who
before
dinner
had
been
the
company
were
now
converted
into
spectators
many
of
them
accommodated
with
seats
in
the
shade
from
whence
they
watched
the
chequered
movements
of
the
motley
crowd
this
cool
and
quiet
position
was
in
every
way
beneficial
to
those
who
had
been
tempted
to
heat
themselves
by
drinking
somewhat
too
freely
of
the
vicar
wine
among
these
corbold
introduced
himself
probably
more
sober
than
any
of
them
except
perhaps
the
vicar
himself
but
bearing
in
his
altered
eye
and
general
discomfiture
of
aspect
more
visible
traces
of
intemperance
than
any
individual
amongst
them
cartwright
rose
to
meet
him
with
sensations
of
considerable
alarm
he
fancied
from
his
appearance
that
he
was
quite
intoxicated
and
feared
the
utterance
of
some
folly
which
might
explain
the
cause
of
his
having
absented
himself
more
fully
than
was
at
all
necessary
this
idea
was
by
no
means
lessened
when
his
cousin
beckoned
him
from
the
party
amidst
whom
he
sat
and
gravely
assured
him
that
miss
helen
had
very
nearly
murdered
him
compose
yourself
cousin
stephen
compose
yourself
where
have
you
left
her
left
her
she
left
me
i
tell
you
blind
and
almost
suffocated
if
you
do
wish
to
have
the
whole
county
set
gossiping
about
mowbray
will
your
wife
will
i
mean
you
had
better
let
me
see
that
vixen
properly
punished
cousin
as
i
live
and
breathe
i
will
have
revenge
somehow
you
shall
you
shall
stephen
answered
the
vicar
endeavouring
to
quiet
him
she
shall
be
treated
in
any
way
that
you
like
only
make
a
noise
now
will
you
give
orders
that
she
shall
be
confined
to
her
room
and
kept
on
bread
and
water
to
be
sure
i
will
if
you
desire
it
she
shall
be
locked
up
as
soon
as
the
place
is
cleared
and
you
shall
see
it
done
stephen
if
you
will
only
step
in
and
take
a
nap
in
my
library
to
recover
yourself
a
little
this
proposal
was
on
the
whole
a
very
tempting
one
for
stephen
corbold
head
ached
with
considerable
violence
not
to
mention
that
he
had
hardly
yet
recovered
his
eyesight
and
was
otherwise
very
ill
at
ease
so
without
arguing
the
matter
farther
he
retreated
to
the
comfortable
station
recommended
to
him
and
soon
fell
into
a
slumber
that
lasted
till
the
whole
business
of
the
day
prayers
blessing
and
all
were
done
and
over
and
the
place
as
solitary
and
forsaken
as
if
no
serious
fancy
fair
no
israelitish
missionary
and
no
fababo
had
ever
been
heard
of
it
was
then
that
the
vicar
of
wrexhill
remembered
his
cousin
stephen
and
it
was
then
that
fanny
mowbray
looking
round
the
room
in
which
the
whole
family
was
assembled
said
where
is
helen
this
question
which
as
it
seemed
no
one
could
answer
and
the
recollection
of
his
library
guest
coming
at
one
and
the
same
moment
across
him
made
cartwright
start
poor
man
he
was
most
heartily
fatigued
and
worn
out
by
the
honours
glories
and
hospitalities
of
the
day
and
wished
for
nothing
on
earth
so
much
as
and
a
bougie
but
he
felt
that
his
labours
were
not
over
though
not
exactly
aware
how
much
remained
to
be
done
having
furnished
himself
with
a
light
and
commanded
that
miss
mowbray
should
be
desired
to
meet
him
in
the
library
he
repaired
immediately
to
that
room
where
he
found
as
he
expected
his
serious
and
legal
relative
as
fast
asleep
in
his
favourite
as
he
himself
wished
to
be
in
his
bed
the
ceremony
of
awaking
him
was
soon
performed
and
when
he
once
more
stood
on
his
feet
and
had
rubbed
his
still
suffering
eyes
sufficiently
to
perceive
where
he
was
the
vicar
addressed
him
thus
in
the
most
gentle
voice
imaginable
hoping
to
soothe
and
get
rid
of
him
well
cousin
stephen
you
have
had
a
nice
nap
and
now
you
had
better
go
home
it
is
getting
quite
late
good
night
stephen
what
have
you
done
with
that
murderous
vixen
cousin
cartwright
i
wo
stir
till
i
know
you
have
locked
her
up
as
you
promised
to
do
i
have
ordered
her
to
come
here
stephen
that
you
may
yourself
hear
what
i
mean
to
say
to
her
i
do
want
to
see
her
cousin
cartwright
replied
the
attorney
in
a
tone
that
betokened
as
much
fear
as
dislike
i
only
want
to
have
her
punished
and
punished
she
shall
be
depend
upon
that
but
if
you
really
do
not
wish
to
see
her
cousin
stephen
you
had
better
be
off
at
once
for
i
expect
her
here
every
moment
come
along
i
will
walk
with
you
myself
as
far
as
the
lodge
whatever
vengeance
he
wished
executed
on
helen
that
he
had
no
inclination
to
be
present
at
it
himself
was
proved
by
the
alacrity
with
which
the
attorney
acceded
to
this
proposal
only
let
me
get
my
hat
it
quite
a
new
hat
and
i
come
with
you
this
moment
cousin
cartwright
the
hat
was
found
and
the
two
serious
gentlemen
set
off
together
across
the
lawn
from
that
point
to
within
a
few
yards
of
the
lodge
the
lawyer
entertained
the
minister
with
such
an
account
of
helen
attack
upon
him
as
convinced
the
latter
that
it
would
be
quite
necessary
in
his
parental
character
to
exercise
such
a
degree
of
authority
as
might
speedily
bring
the
rebellious
young
lady
to
reason
it
was
already
as
dark
as
a
fine
night
in
july
ever
is
and
the
fine
large
oaks
which
in
many
places
overhung
the
road
rendered
some
spots
particularly
sombre
at
one
of
these
and
just
before
they
arrived
at
the
park
gates
they
heard
the
steps
of
a
man
whom
they
appeared
to
be
overtaking
who
can
this
loiterer
be
said
cartwright
my
people
had
orders
to
see
that
the
grounds
were
cleared
and
all
the
gates
locked
before
this
time
we
shall
be
able
to
see
him
when
we
get
beyond
these
trees
replied
corbold
he
was
quite
right
a
few
steps
farther
brought
them
to
an
open
space
and
there
as
if
waiting
for
them
stood
the
intruder
as
still
and
silent
as
if
he
had
been
a
statue
we
are
two
to
one
however
observed
the
attorney
but
he
is
a
monstrous
tall
fellow
the
next
breath
that
issued
from
the
lips
of
the
vicar
cousin
came
not
in
words
but
in
a
most
dismal
hideous
and
prolonged
yell
for
the
tall
fellow
had
seized
him
by
the
collar
with
one
hand
while
with
the
other
he
brandished
and
applied
a
huge
horsewhip
to
his
shoulders
with
such
energy
activity
and
perseverance
that
his
howling
startled
the
dull
ear
of
night
as
well
as
the
frightened
organs
of
his
astonished
kinsman
though
cartwright
had
not
the
slightest
intention
of
doing
so
unclerical
a
thing
as
interfering
in
the
fray
he
drew
a
little
nearer
to
it
than
was
quite
prudent
from
a
natural
curiosity
to
know
who
the
bold
mortal
was
who
dared
thus
belabour
his
cousin
the
light
was
quite
sufficient
to
enable
him
to
discern
colonel
harrington
in
the
aggressor
but
it
should
seem
that
it
was
not
equally
effective
to
the
eyes
of
that
gentleman
himself
or
he
would
hardly
have
ventured
to
permit
a
few
apparently
random
but
very
sharp
cuts
to
visit
the
reverend
shoulders
of
the
owner
of
the
soil
on
which
he
stood
this
prodigious
impiety
however
certainly
took
place
upon
which
the
vicar
very
properly
anxious
to
put
the
earliest
possible
stop
to
such
indecent
proceedings
ran
off
as
fast
as
his
legs
could
carry
him
and
in
about
half
an
hour
returned
again
with
eight
stout
servingmen
armed
with
bludgeons
and
the
great
that
he
had
not
in
his
agitation
forgotten
the
spot
on
which
he
had
left
his
unfortunate
cousin
was
quickly
made
manifest
to
the
ears
of
all
who
accompanied
him
for
dismal
groans
made
themselves
heard
exactly
from
the
place
where
the
operation
had
been
performed
and
on
examination
the
bruised
body
of
stephen
corbold
was
found
extended
on
the
grass
apparently
too
stiff
and
sore
to
have
much
power
of
movement
left
even
during
the
hurried
interval
which
cartwright
spent
in
his
house
while
waiting
for
the
gathering
together
of
his
host
he
had
found
time
to
inquire
of
his
wife
if
she
had
seen
helen
and
being
told
in
reply
that
she
was
nowhere
to
be
found
the
extremely
disagreeable
truth
immediately
suggested
itself
to
him
in
one
short
sharp
moment
he
remembered
colonel
harrington
suppressed
letter
corbold
permitted
outrage
helen
escape
and
the
degrading
lash
that
had
so
vigorously
saluted
his
own
shoulders
how
was
it
possible
that
being
as
he
most
undoubtedly
was
the
lord
and
master
of
cartwright
park
and
all
the
wealth
annexed
thereto
and
holding
his
lady
comprehensive
will
signed
sealed
and
duly
executed
in
his
own
possession
how
could
it
be
that
he
should
feel
so
utterly
beat
down
overpowered
and
degraded
the
bitter
pang
however
lasted
but
a
moment
what
was
the
gossip
of
an
hour
or
a
day
when
set
against
the
solid
happiness
of
wealth
this
was
still
his
to
have
and
to
hold
and
after
one
little
pinch
at
his
heart
as
he
thought
of
the
mitre
he
struggled
manfully
to
despise
the
paltry
annoyance
and
hastened
with
all
the
speed
he
could
make
to
the
rescue
of
his
cousin
and
if
heaven
so
willed
to
inflict
vengeance
even
unto
death
upon
his
enemy
heaven
however
did
not
so
will
colonel
harrington
having
given
the
attorney
exactly
the
quantum
of
flogging
he
intended
stuck
his
card
with
his
name
and
address
both
in
town
and
country
into
the
groaning
man
pocket
laid
him
down
very
gently
on
the
grass
and
departed
the
disposal
of
the
flogged
gentleman
person
was
now
taken
into
consideration
some
cousins
perhaps
might
have
thought
that
a
bed
at
cartwright
park
would
have
been
the
best
thing
to
propose
for
it
but
it
appeared
that
such
was
not
the
opinion
of
cartwright
for
having
quickly
ascertained
the
situation
of
affairs
and
assured
himself
that
colonel
harrington
was
no
longer
within
his
reach
he
instantly
ordered
the
coachman
and
who
were
among
his
suite
to
return
with
all
possible
haste
to
the
house
and
prepare
a
carriage
instantly
to
take
his
cousin
home
take
me
to
your
house
cousin
murmured
the
smarting
man
i
shall
die
if
you
send
me
to
wrexhill
but
cartwright
did
not
happen
to
hear
him
and
indeed
his
time
and
attention
were
wholly
engrossed
till
the
carriage
arrived
and
his
kinsman
lifted
into
it
by
a
strict
examination
of
his
people
at
the
lodge
as
to
when
colonel
harrington
had
entered
the
park
and
whether
they
were
at
all
aware
that
he
was
still
lurking
there
to
all
which
inquiries
he
of
course
received
for
answer
law
your
honour
upon
such
a
day
as
this
how
was
any
body
to
mark
who
went
in
or
who
went
out
of
the
park
stephen
corbold
was
therefore
safely
conveyed
to
his
own
dwelling
in
wrexhill
and
the
vicar
returned
to
tell
his
lady
that
from
circumstances
which
had
transpired
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
her
daughter
helen
had
eloped
with
colonel
harrington
on
my
word
my
dearest
cartwright
i
hardly
know
how
to
be
sorry
for
it
william
harrington
would
be
an
excellent
match
for
any
woman
they
were
very
fond
of
each
other
when
they
were
children
and
helen
has
been
so
miserable
and
moping
ever
since
i
married
that
it
has
been
quite
a
misery
to
see
her
i
thought
she
was
in
love
with
your
cousin
however
i
suppose
she
has
changed
her
mind
again
and
that
it
was
a
fit
of
jealousy
on
the
part
of
harrington
that
made
him
attack
poor
corbold
but
we
ca
help
it
you
know
i
am
tired
to
death
my
dear
cartwright
do
not
let
us
stay
up
any
longer
talking
about
it
i
dare
say
helen
will
be
very
happy
so
ended
the
eventful
day
of
the
fababo
fancy
fair
it
is
not
necessary
to
inquire
what
were
the
reports
or
what
the
gossipings
to
which
this
day
events
gave
rise
the
papers
announced
that
a
very
large
sum
had
been
collected
for
the
interesting
missionary
and
all
the
hampshire
world
soon
said
that
colonel
harrington
was
going
to
be
married
to
miss
mowbray
but
the
attention
of
the
park
family
themselves
was
at
this
time
greatly
engrossed
by
henrietta
she
had
long
been
in
a
very
delicate
state
of
health
but
probably
from
some
cold
caught
at
the
late
fête
her
symptoms
had
become
rapidly
more
alarming
she
was
soon
confined
to
her
bed
and
the
most
skilful
physician
in
the
county
gave
it
as
his
opinion
that
she
could
not
live
many
weeks
rosalind
was
indefatigable
in
her
attentions
to
her
and
when
the
awful
judgment
of
the
physician
was
made
known
to
her
she
at
once
resolved
that
henrietta
should
be
made
acquainted
with
it
in
the
hope
that
the
prospect
of
approaching
dissolution
might
soften
her
heart
and
lead
her
to
seek
and
receive
the
only
consolation
of
which
such
a
situation
admits
rosalind
was
too
truly
attached
to
helen
not
to
rejoice
at
the
unexpected
step
she
had
taken
though
her
surprise
at
it
was
unbounded
she
knew
helen
character
well
she
knew
too
how
implicitly
they
had
trusted
each
other
and
that
this
known
trusted
and
trusting
friend
should
have
eloped
without
having
even
hinted
to
her
that
colonel
harrington
had
confessed
the
love
which
in
happier
moments
she
owned
she
hoped
he
felt
was
inconceivable
still
it
was
true
and
though
no
line
of
explanation
had
ever
been
permitted
to
reach
her
still
she
rejoiced
and
with
all
the
trusting
confidence
of
her
nature
believed
that
whatever
appeared
wrong
or
unkind
would
some
day
or
other
be
explained
she
now
rejoiced
yet
more
at
helen
absence
henrietta
had
never
admitted
her
even
to
the
uncertain
and
capricious
degree
of
friendship
which
she
had
bestowed
on
herself
and
had
she
been
still
at
the
park
it
would
have
been
difficult
for
rosalind
to
have
devoted
herself
so
wholly
to
the
poor
sufferer
as
she
now
did
cartwright
situation
prevented
her
from
being
much
in
the
room
fanny
was
still
less
there
she
and
henrietta
had
never
loved
each
other
at
first
fanny
disliked
her
because
it
was
easy
to
perceive
that
she
was
neither
beloved
nor
approved
by
cartwright
and
henrietta
despised
her
in
return
for
the
easy
weakness
with
which
she
had
become
her
father
convert
so
that
in
this
awful
hour
rosalind
was
the
only
friend
who
drew
near
her
with
affection
and
most
tender
and
constant
was
the
care
she
bestowed
upon
her
to
the
communication
which
she
so
much
dreaded
to
make
though
she
considered
it
her
duty
to
do
it
henrietta
only
replied
by
assuring
her
that
for
more
than
a
year
she
had
been
fully
aware
that
death
was
rapidly
approaching
her
alas
how
lightly
have
i
listened
to
you
dear
henrietta
when
you
have
said
this
replied
the
weeping
rosalind
but
the
reason
dear
friend
why
i
did
not
why
i
could
not
believe
you
were
in
earnest
was
speak
fearlessly
dear
rosalind
was
that
you
thought
i
was
unfit
to
die
but
so
are
many
rosalind
who
yet
must
go
when
nature
bids
them
but
now
now
henrietta
oh
tell
me
that
you
do
not
still
doubt
all
things
doubt
even
the
being
of
the
eternal
power
that
made
you
tell
me
i
beseech
you
that
you
have
read
and
thought
on
these
things
since
that
dreadful
day
that
i
overheard
you
make
the
confession
to
hetherington
which
has
rung
in
my
ears
ever
since
yes
rosalind
i
have
read
and
i
have
thought
but
not
now
only
my
kind
friend
my
short
life
rosalind
has
been
but
one
series
of
perturbed
thinking
my
brain
has
been
racked
by
it
but
i
have
gained
nothing
i
have
no
power
henrietta
no
learning
no
strength
of
reason
to
remove
the
doubts
that
so
fearfully
darken
these
your
last
hours
yet
what
would
i
not
give
that
you
could
taste
the
ineffable
comfort
of
perfect
hope
and
perfect
faith
perfect
faith
repeated
henrietta
impatiently
why
do
you
have
recourse
to
the
slang
i
hate
teach
me
to
hope
oh
that
you
could
but
let
me
not
hear
the
hateful
words
the
false
use
of
which
has
been
my
destruction
henrietta
dearest
henrietta
will
you
consent
to
see
a
clergyman
who
can
speak
to
you
with
the
authority
of
age
and
wisdom
a
clergyman
she
replied
scoffingly
perhaps
you
will
propose
that
i
should
see
the
reverend
mr
cartwright
no
no
you
do
not
think
that
it
is
such
as
him
i
would
wish
to
send
to
you
yet
he
is
my
father
miss
torrington
and
there
it
is
you
see
there
lies
the
difficulty
name
a
clergyman
and
cartwright
seems
to
rise
before
me
and
shall
i
use
my
dying
breath
to
say
that
i
would
hear
with
reverence
what
such
as
he
could
say
leave
me
in
peace
rosalind
let
me
sleep
i
tell
you
if
there
be
a
god
he
will
pity
me
there
was
so
much
feverish
excitement
in
her
manner
of
speaking
that
rosalind
terrified
lest
she
might
hasten
the
hour
she
so
earnestly
wished
to
retard
in
the
hope
that
light
might
break
upon
that
darkness
which
it
was
so
terrible
to
witness
forbore
to
answer
her
and
tenderly
arranging
her
pillows
under
her
head
kissed
her
pale
cheek
and
set
herself
down
behind
the
curtain
in
the
place
that
she
now
almost
constantly
occupied
after
a
moment
however
henrietta
spoke
again
but
it
was
gently
and
calmly
leave
me
my
most
kind
rosalind
said
she
leave
me
for
an
hour
or
two
you
must
want
the
fresh
air
and
i
want
perfect
solitude
rosalind
i
will
think
let
no
one
come
to
me
till
i
ring
my
bell
go
my
dear
friend
rosalind
greatly
affected
by
the
changed
voice
and
manner
pressed
to
her
lips
the
emaciated
hand
held
out
to
her
and
retired
rosalind
did
indeed
require
the
refreshment
of
air
and
exercise
from
which
she
had
almost
wholly
debarred
herself
for
above
a
week
and
such
refreshment
will
certainly
do
more
towards
restoring
the
exhausted
strength
both
to
body
and
mind
than
any
other
remedy
which
can
be
devised
yet
though
it
acts
well
and
almost
infallibly
on
the
system
the
benefit
does
not
at
once
reach
the
consciousness
of
the
weary
watcher
rosalind
as
she
slowly
dragged
her
languid
steps
along
felt
none
of
the
pleasurable
effects
of
the
sweet
breeze
that
blew
in
her
face
for
she
was
not
aware
of
it
her
heart
and
soul
were
still
in
the
chamber
of
the
dying
henrietta
and
though
greatly
too
well
taught
to
believe
that
a
few
feverish
moments
of
changed
opinions
can
put
the
passing
spirit
into
a
state
of
fitness
for
heaven
still
she
clung
to
the
hope
of
hearing
the
unhappy
girl
avow
better
thoughts
and
feelings
than
those
which
had
so
long
brooded
over
her
misguided
spirit
fully
occupied
with
these
meditations
rosalind
walked
for
an
hour
almost
mechanically
through
the
shrubberies
unmindful
of
the
sweet
voice
of
nature
that
greeted
her
in
the
songs
of
birds
and
in
the
breath
of
flowers
and
thinking
only
of
what
she
might
say
or
do
to
make
the
light
of
truth
send
one
cheering
ray
upon
the
last
hours
of
her
unhappy
friend
when
she
the
house
her
maid
who
was
watching
for
her
said
that
miss
cartwright
had
rung
her
bell
and
requested
to
know
when
she
returned
blaming
herself
for
her
long
absence
rosalind
hastened
to
the
sick
room
and
found
henrietta
seated
upright
in
her
bed
with
rather
more
animation
and
brightness
in
her
eyes
than
she
wished
to
see
for
she
thought
it
betokened
fever
but
her
voice
and
manner
were
gentle
and
composed
your
words
have
not
fallen
to
the
ground
my
most
kind
rosalind
said
she
and
if
it
be
possible
during
the
short
period
that
remains
for
me
to
live
that
i
should
attain
a
clearer
knowledge
of
what
i
am
than
i
have
hitherto
possessed
i
shall
welcome
it
most
gladly
but
of
all
the
attributes
with
which
the
beautiful
idea
that
you
call
god
is
invested
the
only
one
that
i
conceive
it
possible
for
mortals
to
share
with
him
is
truth
power
alas
we
have
none
of
knowledge
very
little
of
wisdom
less
and
as
to
perfect
goodness
perfect
benevolence
we
are
not
framed
to
feel
it
but
truth
clear
pure
beautiful
and
bright
we
can
know
and
we
can
feel
it
can
make
a
part
of
us
even
as
it
makes
a
part
of
him
and
by
this
only
as
it
seems
to
me
can
we
approach
him
touch
him
and
as
it
were
be
part
of
him
for
truth
in
a
mortal
rosalind
if
it
exist
at
all
is
perfect
as
in
a
god
it
is
therefore
my
dear
friend
that
though
i
feel
ay
and
have
always
felt
that
there
may
be
an
existing
cause
endowed
with
will
productive
of
all
the
wonders
of
creation
and
though
this
wondrous
existence
if
it
be
deserves
all
worship
and
though
i
more
sinned
against
than
sinning
have
offered
none
yet
still
i
feel
that
i
may
be
forgiven
if
i
have
kept
far
off
from
him
my
worship
and
my
thoughts
at
least
i
never
have
approached
him
with
falsehood
on
my
tongue
or
in
my
heart
and
to
my
judgment
this
is
the
only
crime
relating
to
our
intercourse
with
god
at
which
we
need
to
tremble
if
such
a
being
be
can
our
blundering
theories
so
touch
his
greatness
that
he
should
deign
to
frown
upon
us
for
them
no
no
no
we
can
not
know
him
and
those
who
guess
the
nearest
can
guess
but
very
darkly
but
truth
and
falsehood
are
as
much
within
the
compass
of
man
nature
as
of
god
and
therefore
are
they
as
concerning
him
the
only
virtue
and
the
only
sin
henrietta
spoke
these
words
with
her
eyes
closed
slowly
and
deliberately
as
if
her
mind
like
a
cloud
that
turns
forth
its
silver
lining
to
the
night
sought
in
the
midst
of
darkness
to
show
the
faint
gleam
within
but
every
word
she
uttered
made
rosalind
more
deeply
feel
the
necessity
of
letting
her
hear
the
truths
of
religion
from
some
one
who
had
made
its
laws
the
study
of
a
holy
life
she
longed
that
she
should
hear
with
more
authority
than
she
could
lend
to
it
the
voice
of
god
himself
as
revealed
to
man
in
records
enduring
as
the
world
but
where
was
she
to
seek
such
a
one
as
poor
henrietta
had
said
the
name
of
a
minister
could
to
her
suggest
no
other
image
than
that
of
her
father
and
from
him
she
ever
seemed
to
turn
with
horror
yet
still
rosalind
could
not
endure
to
abandon
the
hope
that
such
a
one
might
be
found
and
only
waited
till
henrietta
would
promise
to
see
him
before
she
took
measures
for
the
purpose
in
answer
to
this
request
the
dying
girl
replied
but
my
permission
is
not
all
that
is
necessary
dearest
rosalind
what
would
my
father
say
if
you
were
fortunate
enough
to
obtain
for
me
a
visit
from
such
a
one
as
you
describe
he
would
not
bear
it
he
would
not
admit
his
approach
i
know
he
would
not
let
me
ask
him
henrietta
no
cried
the
invalid
with
sudden
energy
as
if
she
had
at
that
moment
conceived
and
decided
on
her
line
of
conduct
i
will
ask
him
myself
this
doubt
this
darkness
this
fearful
mist
that
seems
to
hang
about
me
is
terrible
why
should
i
not
feel
hopeful
and
assured
as
you
do
send
to
him
rosalind
send
to
my
father
and
send
too
for
his
besotted
wife
and
for
the
poor
weak
wavering
fanny
send
for
them
but
do
you
leave
me
rosalind
i
have
a
strange
anxious
fluttering
at
my
heart
it
will
be
better
when
i
have
spoken
to
him
rosalind
delayed
not
a
moment
to
do
her
bidding
there
was
an
inequality
in
her
manner
that
frightened
her
she
feared
her
time
was
short
and
so
worded
the
summons
she
sent
to
cartwright
and
his
wife
that
they
came
instantly
fanny
entered
the
room
nearly
at
the
same
moment
and
it
was
evident
from
their
manner
that
they
all
thought
they
were
come
to
receive
her
last
farewell
the
feeble
henrietta
asked
rosalind
so
to
arrange
her
pillows
that
she
might
sit
upright
rosalind
did
so
and
then
kneeled
down
beside
the
bed
cartwright
stood
with
his
back
leaning
against
the
and
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
his
wife
entered
leaning
on
his
arm
and
had
not
quitted
it
but
for
some
reason
or
other
henrietta
who
rarely
took
notice
of
her
in
any
way
now
asked
her
to
place
herself
in
a
chair
beside
her
bed
you
had
better
sit
said
she
you
are
not
very
strong
in
any
way
fanny
stood
apart
and
alone
and
having
looked
round
upon
each
of
them
the
dying
girl
fixed
her
eyes
upon
her
father
and
thus
addressed
him
i
have
heard
you
say
a
thousand
times
perhaps
that
religion
was
the
business
of
your
life
and
for
that
reason
sir
its
very
name
hath
become
abhorrent
to
me
oh
father
you
have
much
to
answer
for
i
would
have
given
my
own
right
hand
to
believe
in
a
good
a
merciful
a
forgiving
god
and
i
turned
my
young
eyes
to
you
you
told
me
that
few
could
be
saved
and
that
it
was
not
what
i
deemed
innocence
could
save
me
you
told
me
too
that
i
was
in
danger
but
that
you
were
safe
you
told
me
that
heaven
had
set
its
seal
upon
you
and
then
i
watched
you
oh
how
earnestly
i
spied
out
all
your
ways
i
found
fraud
pride
impurity
and
falsehood
mix
with
your
deeds
through
every
day
you
lived
yet
still
you
said
that
heaven
had
set
its
seal
upon
you
that
your
immortal
soul
was
safe
that
happiness
eternal
was
your
predestined
doom
i
listened
to
you
as
a
child
listens
to
a
father
not
a
word
was
lost
no
nor
an
action
either
and
then
it
was
father
that
i
became
an
unbeliever
an
hardened
infidel
a
daring
atheist
if
it
were
true
that
god
had
chosen
you
then
was
it
true
my
soul
rejected
him
yet
rosalind
dear
rosalind
do
not
hate
me
do
not
shudder
at
my
words
it
was
because
i
found
no
truth
in
him
that
i
could
not
would
not
believe
his
doctrine
true
but
you
good
kind
and
innocent
i
believe
you
the
harsh
and
awful
accents
of
her
voice
changed
into
a
tone
of
the
deepest
tenderness
as
she
continued
to
address
rosalind
when
did
you
ever
lie
you
tell
me
there
is
a
god
and
i
may
trust
you
you
do
not
prate
of
grace
and
then
labour
to
corrupt
the
innocence
that
looks
into
your
face
to
ask
the
way
to
heaven
you
do
not
bid
me
wear
a
mask
of
feigned
assurance
of
salvation
nor
will
you
bind
my
hands
nor
keep
me
from
the
light
of
day
when
i
refuse
to
kneel
and
sigh
and
play
the
hypocrite
you
will
not
bid
me
lie
and
tell
me
that
so
only
i
can
find
the
way
to
heaven
you
will
not
with
slow
and
stealthy
pace
cartwright
at
this
moment
began
to
creep
from
his
station
and
approach
the
door
but
henrietta
whose
eyes
were
half
closed
for
the
lashes
seemed
heavy
with
tears
instantly
opened
them
and
cried
aloud
stay
i
have
a
right
to
bid
father
this
good
girl
is
kind
and
innocent
but
she
is
young
and
very
what
can
she
know
of
heaven
is
there
speak
truly
these
are
the
last
words
you
will
ever
utter
to
me
is
there
within
our
reach
some
pious
holy
humble
man
of
god
such
as
i
have
read
of
but
no
saint
no
saint
father
is
there
such
a
one
and
may
he
come
and
pray
with
me
every
eye
in
the
room
was
fixed
on
cartwright
as
his
daughter
made
the
appeal
for
some
moments
he
did
not
answer
but
upon
repeating
loudly
and
almost
wildly
may
he
come
he
answered
in
a
low
husky
voice
this
is
mere
bravado
you
have
lived
a
scoffing
infidel
and
a
scoffing
infidel
will
you
die
if
indeed
you
wished
for
prayer
and
pardon
you
would
turn
to
me
for
my
curate
may
pray
with
her
but
none
else
and
with
these
words
he
turned
away
without
looking
at
her
and
quitted
the
room
the
silence
of
death
seemed
already
to
have
settled
on
the
chamber
which
was
broken
at
length
by
the
deep
sobbings
of
the
unfortunate
cartwright
poor
soul
said
henrietta
turning
towards
her
she
is
not
wholly
bad
but
more
unfit
to
judge
and
act
than
a
baby
for
they
can
do
nothing
and
she
alas
can
do
much
dreadful
mischief
with
my
dying
breath
unhappy
victim
of
a
most
finished
hypocrite
i
do
conjure
you
not
to
wrong
your
children
to
enrich
him
poor
soul
he
loves
her
not
no
not
even
so
much
as
silly
as
she
is
she
well
deserves
from
him
he
will
have
a
child
born
to
him
here
and
another
at
gloucester
much
at
the
same
time
do
not
ruin
your
poor
helpless
children
for
him
cartwright
sat
with
her
eyes
immoveably
fixed
on
those
of
henrietta
even
after
she
had
ceased
to
speak
she
sighed
deeply
but
uttered
no
syllable
in
reply
take
her
away
rosalind
i
have
no
more
to
say
to
her
and
poor
fanny
too
heaven
bless
you
fanny
you
may
go
now
my
dear
all
go
but
rosalind
her
commands
were
instantly
obeyed
and
once
more
the
two
strangely
matched
friends
were
left
alone
together
it
is
too
late
now
my
rosalind
my
strength
is
failing
fast
i
can
hardly
see
your
sweet
kind
eyes
dear
rosalind
but
i
can
hear
read
to
me
dearest
quick
open
the
bible
that
you
left
for
me
open
it
where
the
man
says
to
paul
thou
persuadest
me
to
be
a
christian
rosalind
opened
the
precious
volume
and
read
to
her
slowly
and
distinctly
that
exquisite
passage
of
eloquence
which
produced
in
reply
the
words
she
had
quoted
henrietta
eyes
were
closed
but
now
and
then
a
gentle
pressure
of
the
hand
she
held
in
hers
persuaded
rosalind
that
she
heard
and
understood
each
powerful
word
of
that
majestic
pleading
when
she
had
reached
and
read
the
words
henrietta
had
quoted
she
paused
and
in
a
moment
afterwards
the
now
expiring
girl
uttered
in
broken
accents
yes
stop
there
it
has
reached
my
soul
from
your
lips
only
rosalind
then
suddenly
her
dying
eyes
opened
and
fixed
themselves
on
rosalind
she
clasped
her
hands
as
if
in
prayer
and
then
with
a
strong
effort
pronounced
these
words
lord
i
believe
help
thou
my
unbelief
her
head
sank
on
her
breast
the
breath
that
uttered
these
words
was
her
last
chapter
xiii
a
change
comes
the
spirit
of
her
dream
helen
had
been
nearly
six
weeks
at
oakley
without
receiving
a
single
line
or
message
from
any
individual
at
the
park
she
had
written
to
her
mother
fully
explaining
the
reasons
which
had
led
her
so
suddenly
to
absent
herself
and
also
in
the
most
respectful
and
affectionate
manner
announced
to
her
the
proposal
of
colonel
harrington
and
the
approbation
of
his
parents
adding
her
earnest
entreaties
that
her
mother
would
not
withhold
her
consent
to
their
marriage
to
this
letter
she
received
no
answer
a
circumstance
which
would
have
occasioned
her
the
most
cruel
uneasiness
had
not
the
fate
of
colonel
letter
to
herself
enabled
her
to
guess
that
of
her
own
to
her
mother
to
fanny
and
to
rosalind
she
likewise
wrote
and
with
the
same
ill
success
but
fortunately
for
her
tranquillity
their
silence
was
reasonably
interpreted
in
the
same
manner
and
though
this
could
but
ill
console
her
for
the
separation
existing
between
them
it
at
least
prevented
her
from
feeling
the
pang
of
neglected
affection
from
her
brother
she
received
the
only
letter
that
had
reached
her
since
they
parted
and
though
it
was
written
in
a
strain
of
very
melancholy
despondency
respecting
himself
it
spoke
of
her
prospects
with
an
energy
of
satisfaction
and
hope
that
it
was
delightful
to
have
inspired
the
report
of
henrietta
death
reached
her
through
the
servants
and
though
no
cordial
intimacy
had
ever
existed
between
them
she
felt
as
a
young
creature
must
ever
feel
on
hearing
that
a
companion
of
her
own
age
and
sex
was
gone
hence
to
be
no
more
seen
more
than
ever
did
she
wish
for
tidings
of
her
family
and
of
rosalind
perhaps
more
than
of
any
other
for
she
knew
that
if
her
feelings
for
the
poor
henrietta
had
not
amounted
to
affection
she
had
inspired
a
very
powerful
interest
in
her
bosom
and
that
rosalind
was
likely
to
feel
her
early
death
very
painfully
it
was
therefore
with
the
strongest
emotions
of
joy
that
one
morning
rather
more
than
a
week
after
the
event
she
saw
rosalind
approaching
the
principal
entrance
of
the
house
alone
and
on
foot
helen
flew
down
stairs
through
the
hall
and
out
upon
the
steps
to
meet
her
opening
her
arms
to
receive
her
with
all
the
eager
warmth
of
welcome
natural
after
such
an
absence
but
before
rosalind
returned
the
embrace
she
exclaimed
you
have
seen
your
mother
helen
alas
no
replied
helen
would
to
heaven
i
had
rosalind
what
is
it
makes
you
think
i
have
had
this
great
happiness
because
i
have
just
met
her
just
seen
her
with
my
own
eyes
driving
down
the
avenue
impossible
rosalind
you
must
be
mistaken
i
have
been
sitting
in
my
own
room
these
two
hours
copying
a
long
act
of
parliament
for
sir
gilbert
and
if
any
carriage
had
been
here
i
must
have
seen
it
no
no
you
would
not
i
observed
that
the
carriage
drove
direct
from
the
and
out
into
the
avenue
below
the
second
gate
when
i
saw
the
carriage
spite
of
my
astonishment
my
first
feeling
was
terror
lest
i
should
be
seen
myself
and
accordingly
i
retreated
behind
one
of
the
enormous
trees
which
i
am
sure
hid
me
effectually
but
from
whence
i
had
not
only
a
full
view
of
the
cartwright
equipage
but
of
cartwright
in
it
looking
i
am
sorry
to
say
even
paler
and
more
ill
than
usual
is
my
mother
looking
ill
rosalind
said
helen
anxiously
and
seeming
for
the
moment
to
be
unmindful
of
the
strange
circumstance
of
her
having
been
at
oakley
is
she
unwell
i
grieve
to
say
that
i
think
she
is
a
scene
which
took
place
in
poor
henrietta
room
only
a
few
moments
before
she
died
and
at
which
cartwright
was
present
has
i
think
shaken
her
severely
but
what
can
have
brought
her
here
helen
unless
it
were
her
wish
to
see
you
and
yet
she
has
been
and
is
gone
without
your
hearing
of
it
it
is
indeed
most
strange
replied
helen
ringing
the
bell
of
the
into
which
they
had
entered
lady
harrington
is
i
know
in
her
closet
perhaps
my
mother
has
seen
her
has
my
mother
been
here
thomas
inquired
helen
of
the
old
servant
who
answered
the
bell
oh
dear
no
miss
mowbray
that
was
noways
likely
likely
or
not
thomas
i
assure
you
she
has
been
here
said
miss
torrington
for
i
myself
met
her
coming
away
then
if
that
is
the
case
young
ladies
there
is
certainly
no
use
in
my
telling
any
more
lies
about
it
for
that
a
job
i
do
like
to
be
put
upon
seeing
as
i
am
not
over
and
above
used
to
it
and
so
as
you
know
it
already
i
quite
ready
and
willing
to
tell
you
the
mrs
mowbray
i
ask
your
pardon
ladies
but
i
really
ca
call
her
by
no
other
name
mowbray
has
been
shut
up
in
the
library
for
above
two
hours
with
my
master
how
very
strange
exclaimed
rosalind
thoughtfully
then
i
am
sure
she
has
chosen
this
day
for
the
same
reason
that
i
did
cartwright
was
sent
for
last
night
by
the
earl
of
harrowmore
though
he
is
not
very
communicative
about
his
adventures
in
general
he
could
not
resist
mentioning
this
flattering
circumstance
at
tea
last
night
adding
that
he
could
not
refuse
the
excellent
and
pious
old
nobleman
who
probably
was
desirous
of
obtaining
the
benefit
of
his
advice
on
some
business
of
importance
and
this
morning
he
set
off
in
his
and
four
with
two
leaving
word
as
judy
told
me
that
he
should
not
return
till
but
good
heavens
what
can
cartwright
have
to
say
to
sir
gilbert
and
how
in
the
world
did
he
come
to
admit
her
thomas
since
you
know
so
much
you
may
as
well
know
all
ladies
the
carriage
sure
enough
did
not
venture
to
drive
up
even
to
the
back
door
without
leave
asked
of
sir
gilbert
at
least
i
suppose
it
was
to
ask
leave
that
one
of
the
new
park
servants
brought
a
note
for
him
first
i
took
it
in
myself
to
him
and
said
as
i
was
bid
that
the
man
was
to
wait
for
an
answer
never
did
i
see
mortal
face
screw
itself
up
funnier
than
sir
gilbert
when
he
was
reading
that
note
he
looked
for
all
the
world
as
if
he
wanted
to
whistle
howsomever
he
did
no
such
thing
but
only
scrawled
a
bit
of
an
answer
as
grave
as
a
judge
and
then
it
was
miss
mowbray
that
he
ordered
me
to
say
no
word
whatever
of
the
park
servant
coming
or
of
the
carriage
coming
after
as
it
was
likely
to
do
and
he
sealed
up
his
answer
and
told
me
to
give
it
to
the
man
and
then
to
go
into
the
garden
to
look
for
you
and
the
colonel
miss
mowbray
and
bid
you
come
in
as
you
know
i
did
miss
and
after
a
bit
you
went
up
stairs
miss
and
the
colonel
horse
was
ordered
and
when
he
was
off
and
all
clear
then
and
not
before
the
carriage
drove
into
the
and
your
poor
mamma
miss
mowbray
looking
as
white
as
a
sheet
went
tottering
and
trembling
in
to
sir
gilbert
and
there
she
stayed
till
about
ten
minutes
ago
when
the
bell
rang
and
out
she
came
again
but
looking
i
thought
a
deal
less
miserable
thank
you
thomas
said
helen
this
is
i
believe
all
we
wish
to
know
the
man
took
the
hint
and
departed
what
can
all
this
mean
rosalind
said
her
friend
the
moment
the
door
closed
behind
him
has
any
thing
happened
at
home
that
can
account
for
it
i
hardly
know
how
to
answer
you
my
helen
without
appearing
to
know
more
than
i
really
do
for
in
honest
truth
i
know
nothing
your
mother
it
would
be
wrong
to
conceal
it
from
you
helen
is
certainly
very
much
out
of
health
and
for
some
weeks
past
has
appeared
i
think
out
of
spirits
and
unhappy
oh
rosalind
do
you
think
it
is
i
who
have
made
her
so
do
you
think
that
my
coming
here
has
made
her
really
unhappy
indeed
i
do
not
on
the
contrary
i
am
firmly
persuaded
she
rejoices
at
it
you
know
dearest
that
since
her
marriage
i
have
never
been
in
great
favour
and
no
wonder
considering
the
very
particular
aversion
i
have
ever
felt
and
perhaps
manifested
towards
her
bridegroom
but
more
than
once
since
you
left
us
she
has
spoken
to
me
in
a
manner
which
reminded
me
of
the
days
that
are
gone
and
once
she
said
when
that
hateful
cause
of
all
harm
her
tartuffe
husband
was
not
in
the
room
must
greatly
miss
poor
helen
my
dear
rosalind
i
involuntarily
caught
her
hand
and
kissed
it
earnestly
fixing
my
eyes
on
hers
to
discover
if
possible
what
she
thought
and
felt
about
you
she
guessed
as
much
i
fancy
for
she
turned
her
head
away
from
me
but
she
pressed
my
hand
and
said
almost
in
a
whisper
helen
i
trust
that
the
step
she
has
taken
will
end
in
her
happiness
he
entered
just
as
she
had
uttered
these
words
and
the
manner
in
which
she
started
and
withdrew
her
hand
when
the
handle
of
the
door
turned
told
me
plainly
enough
that
her
love
for
her
holy
spouse
was
not
of
that
perfect
kind
which
casteth
out
fear
there
was
moreover
helen
a
tear
in
her
eye
when
she
named
you
oh
my
dear
dear
mother
cried
helen
her
own
eyes
overflowing
with
tenderness
to
hear
this
rosalind
is
a
joy
far
greater
than
i
can
express
and
yet
if
this
returning
love
is
obtained
at
the
expense
of
her
own
happiness
i
am
a
wretch
to
rejoice
at
it
you
would
be
a
wretch
to
purchase
it
at
that
price
perhaps
replied
rosalind
but
not
for
rejoicing
at
it
now
that
poor
soul
she
has
already
paid
the
penalty
as
in
truth
i
fear
she
has
of
peace
of
mind
for
returning
reason
and
what
has
occurred
rosalind
to
make
you
think
her
less
happy
than
heretofore
it
is
not
very
easy
to
answer
that
question
helen
excepting
the
death
of
poor
henrietta
and
the
awful
scene
which
preceded
it
in
which
she
accused
her
father
in
the
presence
of
cartwright
fanny
and
myself
of
pretty
nearly
all
the
sins
and
iniquities
of
which
a
man
can
be
guilty
excepting
this
i
can
hardly
say
that
any
particular
circumstance
has
occurred
which
can
account
for
the
evident
change
in
your
mother
spirits
which
was
quite
as
evident
before
the
death
of
henrietta
as
since
you
have
observed
no
unkindness
towards
her
on
his
part
rosalind
said
helen
anxiously
n
o
certainly
i
have
witnessed
nothing
that
could
be
called
unkindness
you
know
helen
he
can
smile
and
smile
but
he
seems
i
think
to
watch
her
more
than
once
when
i
have
been
going
to
her
i
have
met
him
coming
away
and
when
he
has
seen
me
he
has
turned
back
and
her
room
with
me
i
know
i
have
been
savagely
cross
to
her
ever
since
her
hateful
marriage
but
since
i
have
seen
her
looking
ill
and
miserable
my
hard
heart
has
softened
towards
her
and
i
have
sought
instead
of
avoiding
her
and
i
am
quite
sure
that
from
the
moment
he
perceived
this
change
he
has
been
on
the
to
prevent
our
being
alone
together
my
poor
dear
mother
i
fear
i
fear
that
she
may
live
to
deplore
this
marriage
as
much
as
we
have
ever
done
you
know
rosalind
that
we
never
believed
cartwright
to
be
the
holy
man
he
proclaimed
himself
but
since
i
have
been
here
i
have
heard
dreadful
stories
of
him
lady
harrington
maid
is
a
prodigious
gossip
and
though
i
really
give
her
no
encouragement
she
never
dresses
me
without
telling
me
some
new
report
respecting
him
he
has
however
a
very
strong
party
at
wrexhill
who
appear
firmly
to
believe
that
he
is
a
perfect
saint
but
here
you
know
they
are
literally
and
figuratively
of
another
parish
and
seem
to
make
it
a
matter
of
duty
to
their
own
pastor
to
believe
all
the
tales
they
can
pick
up
about
him
there
is
one
very
shocking
story
indeed
that
is
i
think
quite
incredible
they
say
that
simpson
has
been
seduced
by
him
and
only
went
away
to
be
confined
incredible
no
this
story
is
a
commentary
on
one
part
of
dying
accusation
she
said
he
would
have
a
child
born
to
him
at
gloucester
nearly
at
the
same
time
as
that
expected
here
and
it
is
to
gloucester
she
is
gone
exclaimed
helen
gracious
heaven
what
a
wretch
that
this
at
least
is
true
i
have
not
the
slightest
doubt
rejoined
rosalind
and
what
is
more
i
am
certain
your
mother
has
heard
it
you
know
that
this
precious
vicar
invited
simpson
child
to
pass
the
period
of
her
absence
at
the
park
and
you
must
remember
how
very
fond
of
the
poor
little
thing
your
mother
seemed
to
be
actually
listening
to
her
parrot
performances
in
the
fanatical
line
as
if
she
had
been
inspired
it
was
before
you
went
i
think
that
i
laughed
at
her
so
immoderately
for
saying
that
she
prayed
for
currant
pudding
every
night
and
that
cartwright
was
so
very
angry
with
me
about
it
well
observe
the
change
and
account
for
it
as
you
will
for
the
last
two
or
three
weeks
she
has
hardly
spoken
to
the
child
or
taken
the
least
notice
of
her
and
if
i
am
not
greatly
mistaken
it
is
for
about
the
same
period
that
her
health
and
her
spirits
have
appeared
to
droop
depend
upon
it
helen
some
one
has
carried
this
report
to
her
it
certainly
seems
probable
poor
poor
mamma
how
terrible
her
feelings
must
be
rosalind
if
from
thinking
this
man
something
between
heaven
and
earth
she
has
really
found
out
that
he
is
an
hypocrite
and
a
villain
terrible
indeed
i
would
that
she
had
not
so
well
deserved
it
helen
but
now
comes
the
question
has
brought
her
i
think
i
understand
that
perfectly
replied
helen
no
sooner
are
her
eyes
opened
to
the
real
character
of
this
man
than
her
tenderness
for
us
returns
i
have
little
doubt
that
she
came
here
to
speak
of
me
perhaps
rosalind
she
has
heard
and
you
too
of
my
engagement
with
colonel
harrington
perhaps
we
have
helen
replied
rosalind
laughing
and
i
think
it
likely
that
you
have
partly
read
the
riddle
right
and
that
she
may
have
taken
advantage
of
her
watchful
husband
absence
to
express
to
sir
gilbert
her
approbation
which
you
know
is
necessary
before
you
can
be
married
helen
i
know
it
is
replied
helen
colouring
and
if
indeed
she
has
given
this
consent
she
has
removed
the
only
obstacle
to
our
immediate
marriage
then
heartily
i
wish
you
joy
sweet
friend
said
rosalind
kissing
her
novice
as
i
am
i
found
out
long
ago
did
i
not
helen
that
you
and
colonel
harrington
or
colonel
harrington
and
you
i
really
do
not
know
how
to
express
myself
to
spare
your
beautiful
blushes
my
dear
friend
but
i
am
very
very
glad
of
this
in
every
way
it
is
so
desirable
poor
dear
little
fanny
whose
hair
is
gently
creeping
down
into
ringlets
again
will
find
a
fitter
home
with
you
helen
than
cartwright
park
can
be
for
her
how
fast
your
fancy
runs
rosalind
how
do
we
know
that
my
visit
and
helen
bright
blushes
all
forsook
her
as
she
spoke
how
do
we
know
that
it
was
not
to
forbid
this
marriage
that
she
came
and
not
to
permit
it
two
months
ago
had
the
same
thing
occurred
i
should
have
thought
so
now
i
can
not
think
it
however
helen
this
suspense
can
not
last
long
although
sir
gilbert
forbad
his
servants
to
mention
your
mother
visit
for
fear
perhaps
that
it
should
reach
the
ears
of
her
husband
you
may
depend
upon
it
that
he
will
inform
you
of
it
himself
but
i
must
go
dearest
i
by
no
means
wish
this
instance
of
positive
rebellion
to
the
commands
of
my
guardian
should
be
known
you
must
remember
the
command
i
long
ago
received
not
to
carry
on
any
correspondence
with
the
family
at
oakley
and
this
command
has
never
been
rescinded
so
adieu
my
dearest
helen
i
am
quite
persuaded
now
that
nothing
which
you
could
write
would
reach
me
at
the
park
but
unless
i
am
positively
locked
up
we
may
surely
contrive
to
meet
without
my
again
performing
this
desperate
feat
of
disobedience
could
you
not
wander
in
the
fields
sometimes
i
have
done
so
constantly
dear
rosalind
but
ever
and
always
in
vain
that
has
not
been
because
you
were
forgotten
but
i
have
seldom
left
poor
henrietta
and
never
long
enough
to
have
reached
the
fields
but
now
i
certainly
can
manage
this
i
should
like
to
bring
poor
fanny
with
me
but
this
i
will
not
do
for
fear
of
drawing
down
the
anger
of
cartwright
upon
her
which
she
would
not
bear
i
think
so
well
as
but
ought
i
not
before
i
go
to
ask
for
lady
harrington
oh
yes
i
am
sure
she
would
be
so
very
glad
to
see
you
a
message
was
accordingly
sent
to
my
lady
closet
and
the
two
girls
requested
to
go
to
her
there
helen
was
not
without
hope
that
she
would
mention
to
her
cartwright
visit
but
she
was
disappointed
nor
was
there
the
slightest
reason
to
believe
from
her
manner
that
she
was
acquainted
with
it
she
appeared
exceedingly
pleased
at
seeing
miss
torrington
and
told
her
that
whenever
she
could
venture
to
repeat
the
visit
without
endangering
the
tranquillity
of
her
present
irksome
home
they
should
all
be
delighted
to
see
her
it
was
now
however
high
time
for
her
to
depart
but
while
returning
through
the
in
her
way
to
the
she
met
sir
gilbert
the
remembrance
of
her
last
interview
with
him
and
its
abortive
result
brought
sudden
blushes
to
her
cheeks
she
remembered
too
that
she
had
never
offered
any
explanation
to
sir
gilbert
for
so
suddenly
changing
her
mind
and
altogether
she
felt
so
painfully
embarrassed
that
she
hardly
ventured
to
raise
her
eyes
to
his
face
the
voice
in
which
he
greeted
her
however
soon
chased
every
feeling
of
embarrassment
or
any
thing
else
that
was
not
agreeable
for
it
spoke
nothing
but
welcome
and
hilarity
what
the
rosalind
come
to
look
after
the
runaway
but
i
hope
you
have
not
scolded
her
miss
torrington
for
leaving
you
all
in
the
lurch
upon
my
honour
young
lady
she
was
very
right
take
my
word
for
it
she
never
did
a
wiser
thing
in
her
life
but
has
she
told
you
the
scrape
she
has
got
into
miss
torrington
poor
child
no
sooner
ran
away
from
a
snake
of
a
stepfather
than
she
has
got
noosed
by
a
tiger
of
a
ask
my
lady
else
has
she
told
you
all
about
it
my
dear
perhaps
not
quite
all
sir
gilbert
but
quite
enough
to
make
me
very
happy
and
wish
her
joy
and
you
too
most
heartily
thankye
my
dear
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
i
feel
very
much
inclined
to
wish
myself
joy
i
assure
you
and
my
pretty
daughter
too
kiss
me
helen
bless
you
my
dear
child
and
charles
too
that
a
fine
fellow
miss
torrington
and
bless
your
pretty
fanny
especially
as
her
soul
you
say
has
found
its
way
out
of
limbo
it
is
a
remarkably
fine
pleasant
day
miss
torrington
such
a
day
as
this
always
puts
one
in
spirits
rosalind
turned
to
give
a
farewell
embrace
to
her
friend
whispering
in
her
ear
as
she
did
so
at
least
there
has
been
no
refusal
of
consent
helen
adieu
chapter
xiv
in
which
sundry
visits
are
made
whatever
kind
or
remorseful
feelings
had
led
cartwright
to
make
this
unexpected
visit
to
oakley
she
seemed
to
consider
this
one
visit
enough
for
it
was
never
repeated
and
however
tenderly
she
might
watch
over
the
fate
of
helen
it
was
evident
that
she
could
only
venture
to
do
so
secretly
for
sir
gilbert
never
mentioned
her
visit
to
any
one
but
knowing
she
had
been
there
helen
heart
was
satisfied
when
sir
gilbert
joining
her
hand
and
his
son
together
said
make
haste
children
get
your
courting
done
without
loss
of
time
or
you
may
find
yourselves
married
before
it
is
finished
and
so
continue
lovers
after
the
knot
is
tied
a
thing
never
heard
of
in
civilised
society
but
very
likely
nevertheless
to
happen
to
my
helen
husband
let
her
marry
when
she
will
said
colonel
harrington
to
her
affianced
husband
helen
could
have
no
secrets
and
accordingly
he
had
been
made
acquainted
with
all
that
she
knew
respecting
her
most
unexpected
appearance
at
oakley
he
drew
the
same
inference
from
his
father
joyous
manner
after
it
that
rosalind
had
done
and
when
sir
gilbert
alluded
to
their
marriage
as
an
event
which
was
speedily
to
take
place
no
doubt
remained
either
on
his
mind
or
on
that
of
the
happy
helen
that
cartwright
having
learned
from
some
source
which
her
husband
could
not
impede
the
proposal
that
had
been
made
her
she
had
proved
her
maternal
feelings
not
extinct
though
they
had
seemed
obscured
and
ventured
to
make
this
secret
visit
for
the
purpose
of
formally
giving
her
consent
and
thereby
removing
the
only
obstacle
to
their
marriage
instructions
were
accordingly
immediately
given
by
sir
gilbert
in
person
for
he
declared
that
he
must
see
the
lawyer
himself
and
every
thing
relating
to
settlements
was
speedily
put
in
train
the
day
after
the
baronet
return
to
oakley
he
sent
to
miss
mowbray
requesting
that
she
would
meet
him
in
the
library
and
having
greeted
her
on
her
entrance
with
even
more
than
usual
affection
he
said
do
you
think
my
dear
helen
that
you
should
have
courage
to
make
your
mother
a
visit
even
in
the
lion
den
do
you
think
you
could
have
courage
to
spend
half
an
hour
at
the
park
i
do
think
it
likely
that
master
corbold
has
forgotten
his
horsewhipping
as
yet
so
i
own
i
think
you
may
venture
i
will
go
anywhere
or
do
any
thing
that
you
think
i
ought
to
do
sir
gilbert
and
to
see
my
dear
mother
and
poor
fanny
once
more
would
indeed
be
a
pleasure
to
me
we
have
met
rosalind
twice
since
you
went
to
london
and
she
gives
a
very
indifferent
account
of
mamma
health
poor
thing
you
shall
go
immediately
my
dear
child
if
you
have
no
objection
i
have
ordered
the
carriage
william
and
i
will
go
in
it
with
you
as
far
as
the
lodge
and
there
we
will
wait
your
return
if
you
delay
it
above
an
hour
we
shall
drive
up
to
the
house
to
inquire
what
is
become
of
you
but
you
may
return
to
us
as
much
sooner
as
you
like
the
carriage
drove
to
the
door
as
he
spoke
but
helen
kept
it
not
waiting
long
and
on
returning
from
her
room
to
the
hall
found
colonel
harrington
waiting
to
hand
her
into
it
the
two
gentlemen
stepped
in
after
her
and
in
a
moment
she
found
herself
on
her
road
to
park
accompanied
by
sir
gilbert
and
colonel
harrington
the
strangeness
of
this
came
upon
her
so
forcibly
that
she
exclaimed
almost
unconsciously
is
it
possible
i
do
wonder
at
your
saying
that
my
dear
said
sir
gilbert
it
is
very
natural
but
you
see
helen
that
as
your
mother
has
testified
no
dislike
to
your
approaching
marriage
or
taken
any
steps
to
oppose
it
i
feel
that
she
may
expect
perhaps
in
short
i
think
it
is
very
right
that
you
should
call
upon
her
and
to
prove
that
angry
as
i
have
been
i
do
not
bear
malice
you
may
give
her
this
little
note
from
me
helen
but
for
your
life
child
do
not
let
that
wretch
her
husband
see
her
receive
it
i
believe
in
my
soul
he
would
be
the
death
of
her
if
he
thought
she
could
touch
a
bit
of
paper
from
but
the
truth
is
helen
i
think
she
has
suffered
enough
and
in
short
my
dear
i
forgive
her
with
all
my
heart
and
i
should
like
her
to
have
this
bit
of
a
note
from
me
and
to
get
a
friendly
word
of
answer
in
return
if
i
could
but
for
heaven
sake
be
careful
child
fear
not
sir
gilbert
that
i
should
run
any
risk
of
bringing
more
misery
upon
her
than
i
fear
she
has
already
i
will
be
very
careful
and
most
thankful
am
i
to
be
the
bearer
of
a
word
of
kindness
to
her
from
you
well
well
helen
that
all
right
are
here
we
are
at
the
lodge
look
at
your
watch
my
dear
and
remember
if
you
do
not
return
in
an
hour
we
shall
come
and
fetch
you
i
fear
nothing
for
the
fellow
knows
you
are
under
the
protection
of
the
oakley
horsewhips
only
it
is
as
well
to
leave
nothing
to
chance
if
you
can
not
in
any
way
escape
the
eyes
of
the
villain
bring
my
note
back
there
now
dear
get
out
good
the
colonel
was
already
at
the
door
to
assist
her
and
whispered
earnestly
as
he
quitted
her
hand
you
will
not
stay
the
full
hour
helen
if
you
love
me
with
a
step
as
light
as
camilla
helen
traversed
the
park
and
with
a
heart
throbbing
with
many
feelings
wound
her
way
through
sundry
twistings
and
turnings
that
brought
her
to
the
same
door
by
which
she
had
quitted
the
house
on
the
memorable
day
of
the
fancy
fair
from
what
rosalind
had
told
her
she
thought
that
if
she
could
find
her
way
unannounced
to
her
mother
it
was
probable
she
should
find
her
alone
and
thereby
be
enabled
to
perform
her
errand
without
danger
in
the
she
saw
one
of
the
regenerated
but
he
did
not
appear
to
take
much
notice
of
her
and
she
succeeded
in
reaching
her
mother
without
interruption
she
had
calculated
rightly
cartwright
was
sitting
or
rather
lying
alone
in
her
for
she
was
stretched
upon
a
sofa
totally
unemployed
and
appearing
so
ill
that
helen
almost
uttered
a
cry
as
she
looked
at
her
at
the
sight
of
her
daughter
cartwright
started
violently
and
rising
from
her
recumbent
posture
threw
her
arms
round
her
with
even
passionate
fondness
but
dear
inexpressibly
dear
as
was
this
moment
to
helen
heart
she
did
not
forget
her
commission
and
while
her
lips
still
rested
on
her
mother
cheek
she
drew
sir
gilbert
note
from
her
pocket
and
placed
it
in
her
hand
read
it
quick
dearest
mother
i
know
not
what
it
contains
but
sir
gilbert
charged
me
to
let
no
one
see
you
read
it
cartwright
seemed
not
to
require
any
stimulant
to
caution
for
reading
it
rapidly
she
tore
it
into
atoms
and
then
removing
some
of
the
fuel
from
the
grate
which
though
not
lighted
was
prepared
for
fire
she
carefully
placed
the
fragments
on
the
rest
and
covered
them
up
so
that
no
speck
remained
visible
while
thus
employed
she
said
to
helen
almost
in
a
whisper
thank
sir
gilbert
tell
him
i
am
better
at
least
well
enough
to
take
an
airing
helen
had
reason
to
rejoice
that
she
had
lost
no
time
in
executing
her
commission
for
scarcely
had
her
mother
in
all
haste
resumed
her
place
upon
the
sofa
when
cartwright
entered
by
some
means
or
other
her
arrival
had
certainly
been
announced
to
him
for
his
countenance
and
manner
expressed
agitation
but
not
surprise
he
looked
keenly
first
at
his
wife
and
then
at
her
but
they
were
prepared
for
it
and
excepting
that
cartwright
pale
cheek
was
slightly
flushed
and
helen
brow
contracted
by
an
involuntary
frown
they
neither
of
them
betrayed
any
symptom
of
agitation
the
vicar
of
wrexhill
uttered
no
word
of
salutation
or
of
welcome
to
his
unexpected
guest
nor
did
helen
address
him
he
placed
himself
without
any
pretext
of
occupation
whatever
in
a
chair
commanding
a
full
view
of
his
wife
and
her
daughter
and
folding
his
arms
fixed
his
eyes
first
on
one
and
then
on
the
other
with
the
most
undisguised
determination
of
watching
them
both
the
first
words
spoken
were
by
helen
may
i
be
permitted
to
see
my
sister
fanny
said
she
she
addressed
herself
to
her
mother
but
received
her
answer
from
cartwright
most
assuredly
no
you
have
stolen
into
my
house
by
a
back
entrance
and
by
the
same
you
may
leave
it
you
are
used
to
the
mode
it
will
not
puzzle
you
and
if
i
may
venture
to
give
my
opinion
on
the
subject
the
sooner
you
again
make
use
of
this
appropriate
mode
of
retreat
the
better
i
believe
you
are
right
sir
replied
helen
coldly
adding
very
judiciously
the
reception
i
have
met
with
has
not
been
such
as
to
give
me
any
inclination
to
repeat
the
visit
good
morning
good
morning
mr
cartwright
cartwright
inexpressibly
relieved
by
this
happy
stroke
of
policy
stiffly
bowed
her
head
and
helen
retreated
very
literally
obeying
the
mandate
of
the
imperious
master
of
the
mansion
and
returning
by
the
way
she
came
soon
rejoiced
her
friends
by
her
reappearance
before
half
the
allotted
time
had
expired
helen
most
accurately
reported
every
word
and
look
which
seemed
not
only
to
satisfy
but
perfectly
to
enchant
sir
gilbert
he
laughed
rubbed
his
hands
made
her
repeat
every
word
again
and
literally
chuckled
with
delight
as
she
dwelt
upon
the
fortunate
rapidity
with
which
she
had
seized
the
only
available
moment
to
do
his
bidding
on
the
following
morning
sir
gilbert
when
asked
by
his
lady
what
he
was
going
to
do
with
himself
replied
that
he
thought
he
should
ride
over
to
wrexhill
he
did
so
and
returned
only
in
time
to
dress
himself
for
dinner
the
following
day
and
again
the
day
after
the
same
question
answer
and
result
occurred
it
being
quietly
remarked
moreover
by
the
rest
of
the
party
that
the
particularly
sweet
temper
which
the
worthy
baronet
had
brought
from
london
appeared
day
by
day
to
be
wearing
away
and
something
of
what
his
lady
called
his
tiger
mood
taking
its
place
on
the
fourth
morning
her
ladyship
daily
inquiry
having
received
in
very
sullen
accents
the
same
reply
colonel
harrington
remarked
upon
it
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
adding
that
he
had
a
great
inclination
to
go
over
to
wrexhill
in
order
to
discover
if
possible
how
his
honoured
but
mysterious
father
employed
himself
there
i
really
shall
be
very
much
obliged
to
you
william
if
you
will
find
this
out
said
lady
harrington
it
is
the
first
time
since
we
two
became
one
that
i
have
ever
suspected
him
of
having
a
secret
and
the
consequence
is
that
i
am
like
to
die
of
curiosity
thus
encouraged
i
shall
be
gone
instantly
take
care
of
helen
mother
till
i
come
back
and
with
these
words
he
departed
leaving
the
two
ladies
leisure
and
inclination
to
discuss
at
length
the
many
singular
caprices
of
which
sir
gilbert
had
been
lately
guilty
at
about
four
colonel
harrington
returned
but
his
report
tended
rather
to
thicken
than
to
elucidate
the
mystery
he
had
without
being
remarked
himself
seen
his
father
walking
up
and
down
the
town
apparently
in
a
state
of
the
most
perfect
idleness
and
then
the
cartwright
carriage
drove
by
the
shop
in
which
he
had
fixed
his
and
cartwright
were
both
in
it
it
stopped
at
the
next
door
which
was
that
of
the
haberdasher
and
they
entered
the
shop
together
in
about
ten
minutes
cartwright
came
out
and
he
heard
him
say
to
his
lady
as
he
supposed
get
your
business
done
as
quickly
as
you
can
i
shall
be
back
in
ten
minutes
he
then
the
carriage
and
drove
off
the
instant
he
was
gone
sir
gilbert
came
out
of
the
into
which
he
had
darted
as
the
carriage
passed
and
entered
the
shop
in
which
cartwright
was
left
the
interview
if
he
had
sought
one
with
her
certainly
did
not
last
above
five
minutes
when
he
reappeared
followed
by
the
master
of
the
shop
making
innumerable
bows
sir
gilbert
cut
his
obsequious
civilities
short
by
heartily
shaking
hands
with
him
and
then
departed
where
he
went
next
continued
the
colonel
i
know
not
but
not
choosing
to
meet
him
and
feeling
somehow
or
other
perfectly
persuaded
that
he
had
seen
cartwright
and
that
this
interview
short
as
it
was
had
been
what
he
waited
for
i
got
my
horse
and
galloped
home
as
fast
as
i
could
scarcely
had
he
finished
his
narrative
when
sir
gilbert
arrived
he
said
not
a
word
however
to
throw
any
light
upon
his
own
adventures
yet
was
he
neither
silent
nor
sad
several
weeks
elapsed
after
this
without
bringing
to
helen
any
tidings
of
her
mother
her
appearance
and
manner
during
their
short
interview
had
indicated
so
much
languor
and
that
her
anxiety
respecting
her
became
very
acute
and
daily
did
she
haunt
every
spot
where
it
was
probable
she
should
meet
with
rosalind
but
in
vain
no
rosalind
came
and
nothing
was
left
but
to
inquire
through
servants
and
tradespeople
the
news
of
the
park
nothing
however
obtained
in
this
way
afforded
her
satisfaction
for
not
only
did
every
report
so
obtained
tend
to
confirm
the
idea
that
cartwright
was
an
invalid
but
notwithstanding
they
were
on
many
points
uncertain
and
contradictory
they
all
agreed
in
representing
the
conduct
of
cartwright
as
being
strangely
altered
and
giving
ground
of
fear
to
those
who
loved
or
pitied
his
unfortunate
wife
that
he
would
every
day
become
a
harsher
and
more
jealous
tyrant
to
her
for
that
of
late
he
appeared
fearful
of
leaving
her
for
an
hour
alone
happy
therefore
as
helen
individual
prospects
appeared
to
be
a
heavy
weight
and
sad
foreboding
hung
upon
her
spirits
her
brother
letters
too
though
eloquent
in
affection
and
in
every
expression
of
joy
at
her
approaching
marriage
spoke
of
himself
in
a
tone
of
such
hopeless
despondency
as
dashed
her
happier
destiny
with
bitterness
it
was
no
slight
augmentation
of
these
sorrows
that
she
felt
herself
in
a
great
measure
obliged
to
conceal
them
to
colonel
harrington
indeed
she
ventured
to
confess
that
her
anxious
solicitude
for
those
she
loved
tarnished
her
happiness
but
this
confidence
brought
with
it
more
sorrow
than
comfort
for
she
perceived
but
too
plainly
that
she
had
blighted
his
happiness
while
confessing
the
imperfection
of
her
own
lady
harrington
though
all
kindness
and
even
tenderness
to
her
seemed
almost
cautiously
to
avoid
every
subject
that
led
her
to
talk
of
her
family
and
as
for
sir
gilbert
he
appeared
to
be
enjoying
a
state
of
spirits
so
enviable
in
their
uniform
cheerfulness
that
to
mention
fear
or
sorrow
to
him
would
have
been
wanton
cruelty
at
length
from
the
butcher
or
the
baker
or
some
other
of
those
indispensable
functionaries
who
know
all
things
concerning
those
who
live
move
and
have
their
being
by
means
of
their
ministering
ambulations
and
who
fail
not
to
make
all
they
know
to
circulate
as
freely
as
they
do
themselves
at
length
from
some
such
the
news
arrived
at
oakley
that
cartwright
had
presented
her
husband
with
a
son
and
moreover
that
the
mother
and
child
were
as
well
as
could
be
expected
to
helen
this
intelligence
brought
the
most
unfeigned
joy
she
believed
that
all
her
fears
for
her
mother
health
had
been
unfounded
and
that
though
it
seemed
certain
that
she
must
live
banished
from
her
recovered
love
she
might
at
least
enjoy
the
comfort
of
believing
that
she
was
well
and
happy
on
sir
gilbert
the
intelligence
produced
a
very
different
effect
as
helen
regained
her
spirits
he
lost
his
and
though
he
was
still
gentle
and
kind
to
her
he
was
upon
the
whole
as
cross
crusty
and
disagreeable
as
it
is
easy
to
imagine
one
morning
while
colonel
harrington
and
helen
were
sauntering
in
the
avenue
he
enjoying
her
improved
cheerfulness
and
she
secretly
blaming
herself
for
having
ever
suffered
him
to
pine
for
the
want
of
it
they
perceived
a
servant
in
the
cartwright
livery
galloping
towards
the
house
the
same
idea
the
same
terror
though
felt
in
a
most
unequal
degree
struck
them
both
helen
turned
deadly
pale
and
so
persuaded
did
she
feel
that
her
mother
was
dead
that
when
they
stopped
the
man
and
received
from
him
a
verbal
notice
that
her
mother
was
very
ill
and
wished
to
see
her
the
words
though
alarming
enough
in
themselves
seemed
to
be
a
relief
they
returned
with
all
haste
to
the
house
to
order
the
carriage
for
her
and
while
she
was
preparing
for
this
sad
and
most
unexpected
expedition
the
colonel
questioned
the
servant
and
learned
from
him
that
cartwright
infant
having
died
in
convulsions
in
her
arms
she
had
fallen
into
a
state
considered
by
her
attendants
as
extremely
dangerous
that
during
the
whole
of
the
last
night
she
had
remained
nearly
insensible
but
having
recovered
her
intellects
and
speech
her
entreaties
to
see
helen
were
so
urgent
that
cartwright
who
as
the
man
said
never
left
her
bedside
for
an
instant
consented
that
she
should
be
sent
for
miss
fanny
and
miss
torrington
were
also
with
her
he
added
and
young
mowbray
had
been
written
to
but
he
believed
from
what
the
people
about
her
said
that
there
was
little
chance
of
her
surviving
till
he
arrived
having
learned
these
particulars
the
colonel
sought
his
father
not
only
to
communicate
them
but
to
ask
his
opinion
as
to
the
propriety
of
his
accompanying
helen
on
this
sad
visit
i
can
not
bear
he
added
that
she
should
go
alone
of
course
young
sir
you
can
not
replied
sir
gilbert
with
a
sudden
and
as
his
son
thought
not
very
feeling
return
of
cheerfulness
i
should
as
soon
think
of
letting
her
walk
thither
on
but
your
lovership
must
excuse
me
if
i
declare
that
it
is
my
intention
to
accompany
the
young
lady
myself
i
am
sorry
for
you
william
but
so
it
must
be
there
the
carriage
go
to
my
lady
closet
and
let
her
hear
the
news
so
saying
the
baronet
without
waiting
to
receive
any
answer
hastened
to
the
door
and
reached
it
just
as
helen
was
stepping
into
the
carriage
without
consulting
her
on
the
subject
he
stepped
in
after
her
and
they
drove
away
it
would
be
doing
an
injustice
to
the
essentially
kind
feelings
of
sir
gilbert
not
to
avow
that
his
manner
expressed
very
tender
sympathy
with
helen
natural
and
heavy
sorrow
but
the
minds
of
both
were
full
and
few
words
passed
between
them
during
their
drive
the
were
standing
wide
open
and
they
dashed
through
them
without
seeing
any
one
of
whom
the
trembling
helen
could
make
inquiry
but
once
arrived
at
the
house
all
suspense
was
soon
over
cartwright
had
breathed
her
last
about
ten
minutes
before
they
got
there
poor
helen
first
burst
of
grief
was
terrible
the
remembrance
of
her
poor
mother
last
embrace
though
it
became
the
most
soothing
comfort
to
her
during
her
after
life
seemed
at
that
moment
only
to
soften
her
heart
to
greater
suffering
passive
and
almost
unconscious
she
suffered
sir
gilbert
to
lift
her
out
of
the
carriage
and
lay
her
on
a
sofa
in
the
and
there
her
tears
flowing
fast
and
her
very
soul
as
it
seemed
melting
within
her
she
might
probably
have
long
given
way
to
her
absorbing
grief
had
not
surprise
acted
on
her
faculties
more
powerfully
than
salts
or
hartshorn
and
forced
her
to
open
her
eyes
and
her
ears
to
witness
the
scene
that
passed
before
her
having
seen
her
placed
on
a
sofa
with
a
female
servant
standing
by
her
sir
gilbert
turned
his
attention
from
helen
and
politely
requested
permission
to
wait
on
cartwright
many
many
things
of
an
ordinary
nature
might
have
passed
around
her
without
rousing
helen
from
her
deep
and
most
true
sorrow
but
this
request
and
still
more
the
tone
in
which
it
was
spoken
awakened
all
her
attention
to
what
followed
the
servant
to
whom
sir
gilbert
addressed
himself
executed
his
commission
promptly
and
effectually
for
almost
immediately
after
closing
the
door
he
threw
it
open
again
and
his
master
entered
cartwright
walked
into
the
room
with
a
proud
and
lofty
aspect
and
a
something
both
of
sternness
and
of
triumph
on
his
brow
which
helen
thought
sir
gilbert
would
not
easily
endure
but
to
her
extreme
surprise
the
baronet
accosted
him
with
a
degree
of
almost
servile
civility
bowing
low
and
uttering
a
few
words
of
respectful
condolence
with
as
much
deference
and
ceremony
as
if
addressing
a
sovereign
prince
on
the
loss
of
his
consort
cartwright
replied
with
equal
decorum
but
the
glance
of
pride
and
triumph
not
quite
unmixed
with
something
that
gleamed
like
malice
too
shot
from
his
eye
and
helen
shuddered
as
she
looked
at
him
i
presume
that
you
are
aware
cartwright
said
sir
gilbert
with
imperturbable
suavity
that
your
late
lady
eldest
daughter
miss
mowbray
is
about
to
contract
a
marriage
with
my
son
her
remaining
therefore
a
member
of
my
family
will
certainly
be
very
agreeable
to
us
all
but
at
this
painful
moment
it
would
doubtless
be
a
consolation
to
the
sisters
as
well
as
to
their
friend
miss
torrington
could
they
be
together
will
you
therefore
permit
me
sir
to
convey
the
three
young
ladies
to
my
house
together
there
to
await
the
opening
of
the
late
cartwright
will
for
this
young
lady
sir
replied
the
vicar
of
wrexhill
pointing
to
helen
as
she
has
chosen
to
exchange
the
protection
of
her
own
mother
for
that
of
your
son
i
have
nothing
to
say
excepting
perhaps
that
the
sooner
she
leaves
my
house
the
better
satisfied
i
shall
feel
myself
but
for
miss
torrington
and
miss
fanny
mowbray
i
must
think
further
of
it
before
i
resign
them
to
any
one
well
sir
replied
sir
gilbert
with
if
possible
urbanity
we
must
in
this
and
all
things
submit
ourselves
wholly
to
your
will
and
pleasure
but
may
i
in
testimony
of
my
respect
to
the
memory
of
a
lady
towards
whom
perhaps
i
have
behaved
with
some
harshness
may
i
hope
cartwright
that
you
will
permit
me
to
attend
her
funeral
of
this
too
i
must
think
further
replied
cartwright
with
much
haughtiness
and
her
son
rejoined
the
humbled
baronet
i
trust
he
will
be
present
at
the
last
sad
ceremony
it
is
probable
i
may
permit
him
to
be
so
replied
the
vicar
drawing
himself
up
into
an
attitude
that
might
really
have
been
called
majestic
but
permit
me
to
observe
sir
gilbert
harrington
such
is
i
think
your
name
that
i
require
not
in
the
arrangement
of
my
affairs
counsel
or
advice
from
any
man
and
least
of
all
from
you
so
saying
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
stalked
out
of
the
room
come
my
poor
helen
said
the
repulsed
baronet
with
great
gentleness
and
not
in
the
least
as
it
seemed
resenting
the
insolence
with
which
he
had
been
treated
come
i
would
have
wished
to
have
taken
your
poor
little
sister
and
and
your
friend
rosalind
home
with
us
but
will
and
the
vicar
must
be
done
chapter
xv
cartwright
last
will
and
testament
it
was
probably
the
love
of
seeing
an
enemy
mortified
which
it
may
be
feared
is
too
common
to
all
men
which
induced
the
vicar
of
wrexhill
notwithstanding
the
deep
aversion
he
felt
for
sir
gilbert
harrington
to
suffer
him
not
only
to
be
invited
to
attend
cartwright
funeral
but
also
to
be
present
at
the
opening
of
her
will
to
both
invitations
the
baronet
returned
a
gracious
acceptance
and
accordingly
once
more
found
himself
at
the
park
on
the
day
that
its
gates
were
again
to
open
to
the
funeral
array
of
its
owner
charles
mowbray
as
sir
gilbert
carriage
drew
up
stood
ready
on
the
steps
of
the
mansion
to
receive
him
and
tears
moistened
the
eyes
of
both
as
they
silently
shook
hands
and
entered
the
where
the
funeral
guests
were
assembled
the
room
was
full
not
only
all
such
saintly
scions
of
the
new
birth
as
their
esprit
de
corps
always
brought
together
were
present
there
but
as
many
of
the
neighbouring
gentry
as
he
could
collect
were
now
assembled
to
witness
the
proud
fanatic
crowning
triumph
one
circumstance
only
tended
to
damp
the
happiness
of
this
full
success
this
great
conclusion
to
all
his
hopes
and
wishes
his
son
was
not
present
at
it
and
indeed
so
great
had
been
the
licence
granted
him
that
he
was
at
this
time
wandering
his
proud
father
knew
not
where
nothing
however
notwithstanding
his
happiness
could
be
better
got
up
than
cartwright
sorrow
as
he
watched
his
wife
laid
in
the
tomb
never
was
white
cambric
used
with
better
grace
poor
charles
the
while
sheltered
himself
behind
the
stalwart
figure
of
sir
gilbert
and
wept
unseen
nearly
the
whole
of
the
company
who
attended
the
funeral
were
invited
to
be
present
at
the
ceremony
of
opening
of
the
will
which
it
was
the
pleasure
of
the
bereaved
widower
should
follow
immediately
after
it
again
the
large
was
surrounded
by
a
circle
of
sable
guests
not
one
of
whom
but
felt
more
than
usual
curiosity
at
the
opening
a
will
upon
which
hung
so
large
a
property
and
concerning
which
there
were
such
conflicting
interests
sir
gilbert
considerately
led
his
friend
charles
into
a
corner
where
he
was
not
conspicuous
and
placed
himself
beside
him
both
of
them
being
in
good
part
concealed
by
the
tall
and
portly
person
of
a
gentleman
whom
young
mowbray
had
never
seen
before
and
whom
indeed
several
persons
not
too
much
interested
in
the
scene
to
note
what
passed
had
observed
to
enter
with
the
funeral
train
after
its
return
from
the
church
although
he
had
not
been
present
at
the
interment
it
is
probable
however
that
the
master
of
the
house
himself
was
not
aware
of
this
for
he
took
no
notice
of
him
and
was
in
fact
too
fully
occupied
by
the
business
afoot
to
know
more
or
to
think
more
of
those
around
him
than
that
they
were
there
to
witness
the
proudest
and
happiest
moment
of
his
life
all
the
company
being
seated
and
mute
attentive
silence
hovering
over
all
corbold
after
bowing
to
two
or
three
distinguished
personages
whose
seats
were
placed
near
the
table
at
which
he
had
stationed
himself
as
if
to
assure
their
attentive
witnessing
of
the
act
he
was
about
to
perform
broke
open
the
seals
of
the
parchment
he
held
in
his
hand
and
having
spread
it
fairly
open
upon
the
table
read
its
contents
aloud
with
a
clear
voice
never
man
had
a
more
attentive
auditory
no
sound
or
movement
interrupted
the
lecture
and
when
it
was
concluded
a
murmur
only
of
rather
congratulation
from
the
particular
friends
of
cartwright
broke
the
continued
silence
something
meanwhile
very
like
a
groan
burst
from
the
breast
of
the
unhappy
mowbray
but
sir
gilbert
harrington
hemmed
so
stoutly
at
the
same
moment
that
no
one
heard
it
the
company
had
already
risen
from
their
seats
and
some
were
crowding
round
the
meek
and
vicar
nay
one
active
carrier
of
evil
tidings
had
slipped
out
of
the
room
to
inform
miss
torrington
and
fanny
of
the
nature
of
the
departed
lady
testament
when
the
tall
gentleman
who
sat
before
the
disinherited
son
arose
and
with
great
politeness
requested
the
attention
of
the
company
for
one
moment
before
they
separated
for
the
purpose
of
hearing
a
document
which
he
should
be
happy
to
have
the
pleasure
of
reading
to
them
and
which
if
not
of
so
extraordinary
a
nature
as
the
one
they
had
just
listened
to
and
therefore
less
likely
to
excite
general
attention
was
at
least
of
later
date
every
one
appeared
to
listen
to
this
address
with
interest
and
nearly
the
whole
company
immediately
reseated
themselves
some
persons
fancied
they
perceived
the
vicar
of
wrexhill
change
colour
but
they
were
probably
mistaken
for
when
corbold
whispered
to
him
in
the
name
of
heaven
what
does
this
mean
cousin
you
never
left
her
did
you
he
replied
also
in
a
whisper
but
in
a
steady
voice
never
for
time
enough
to
draw
a
codicil
it
is
impossible
and
having
so
spoken
he
too
reseated
himself
in
the
attitude
of
a
listener
the
tall
gentleman
then
drew
forth
from
his
pocket
another
parchment
purporting
to
be
the
last
will
of
the
same
lady
containing
even
more
skins
that
the
first
and
running
over
with
technical
volubility
a
preamble
only
important
as
describing
the
testator
state
of
mind
he
proceeded
to
the
more
essential
portion
of
the
document
and
then
read
slowly
and
loudly
so
that
all
men
might
hear
the
bequest
of
all
she
died
possessed
of
to
her
beloved
son
charles
mowbray
the
only
deductions
being
legacies
of
fifty
thousand
pounds
to
each
of
her
younger
children
and
her
jewels
to
her
daughter
helen
provided
that
within
one
year
from
the
date
of
the
will
she
should
marry
or
have
married
colonel
william
harrington
of
his
majesty
dragoons
the
name
of
cartwright
appeared
not
in
any
shape
probably
because
the
provision
for
her
younger
children
would
have
included
the
infant
yet
unborn
when
this
will
was
made
had
it
survived
her
this
document
was
as
fully
and
satisfactorily
signed
sealed
witnessed
and
delivered
as
the
former
one
the
only
difference
being
that
it
was
dated
some
months
later
the
pen
that
has
traced
these
events
is
too
feeble
to
portray
the
state
into
which
this
change
of
scenery
and
decorations
threw
the
vicar
of
wrexhill
it
would
have
been
a
great
mercy
for
him
if
he
had
altogether
lost
his
senses
but
no
symptom
of
this
sort
appeared
beyond
a
short
paroxysm
during
which
he
called
upon
heaven
to
witness
his
promise
of
going
to
law
with
mowbray
for
the
purpose
of
setting
aside
his
mother
will
after
the
first
buzz
produced
by
this
second
lecture
had
subsided
sir
gilbert
harrington
arose
and
addressed
the
company
with
equal
good
taste
and
good
feeling
a
few
minutes
conversation
with
his
young
friend
mowbray
he
said
authorized
him
to
assure
the
vicar
of
wrexhill
that
whatever
private
property
he
could
lay
claim
to
a
wag
here
whispered
sermons
surplices
and
the
like
should
be
packed
up
and
sent
to
the
vicarage
or
any
other
place
he
would
name
with
the
utmost
attention
and
care
he
added
very
succinctly
and
without
a
single
syllable
unnecessarily
irritating
that
circumstances
connected
with
the
situation
of
the
ladies
of
the
family
rendered
it
necessary
that
the
reverend
gentleman
should
not
continue
in
the
house
a
necessity
which
it
might
be
hoped
would
be
the
less
inconvenient
from
the
circumstance
of
his
former
residence
being
so
near
while
his
old
friend
was
uttering
this
extremely
judicious
harangue
charles
escaped
by
a
side
door
from
the
room
and
bounding
up
the
stairs
to
rosalind
where
though
as
yet
he
had
hardly
spoken
to
her
he
pretty
well
knew
she
was
sitting
with
his
sister
fanny
he
burst
open
the
door
rushed
in
and
fell
on
his
knees
before
her
clasping
her
most
daringly
in
his
arms
and
almost
devouring
her
hands
with
kisses
fanny
stood
perfectly
aghast
at
this
scene
during
the
few
days
that
charles
had
been
at
home
she
had
truly
grieved
to
see
the
decided
coldness
and
estrangement
that
was
between
rosalind
and
him
and
what
could
have
produced
this
sudden
change
she
was
totally
unable
to
guess
not
one
of
the
family
party
had
entertained
the
slightest
doubt
that
the
will
which
cartwright
had
more
than
once
alluded
to
was
such
as
to
render
his
late
wife
children
wholly
dependent
upon
him
and
this
painful
expectation
had
been
already
fully
confirmed
but
even
if
it
had
proved
otherwise
fanny
knew
no
reason
why
this
should
so
change
the
conduct
of
charles
towards
miss
torrington
not
so
however
the
young
lady
herself
the
vehement
caresses
of
mowbray
explained
the
whole
matter
to
her
as
fully
and
as
clearly
as
the
will
itself
could
have
done
and
if
she
did
bend
forward
her
head
till
her
dark
tresses
almost
covered
his
and
if
under
that
thick
veil
she
impressed
a
wild
and
rapid
kiss
of
joy
upon
his
forehead
most
people
would
forgive
her
if
they
knew
how
well
she
had
all
the
while
guessed
at
his
misery
and
how
often
her
young
heart
had
ached
to
think
of
it
this
impropriety
however
such
as
it
was
was
really
the
only
one
committed
on
the
occasion
sir
gilbert
was
an
excellent
man
of
business
as
was
likewise
the
tall
gentleman
his
attorney
so
seals
were
put
upon
all
and
the
like
except
such
as
were
proved
satisfactorily
by
stephen
corbold
to
have
been
purchased
since
the
marriage
of
the
widow
mowbray
and
cartwright
all
such
were
given
over
to
the
of
the
serious
attorney
and
the
serious
butler
and
at
nine
the
vicar
of
wrexhill
stepped
into
his
but
not
travelling
carriage
and
turned
his
back
on
the
park
once
more
for
ever
but
little
remains
to
be
said
that
may
not
easily
be
guessed
at
by
the
accomplished
and
for
such
of
course
these
pages
are
prepared
little
mary
richards
speedily
became
lady
hilton
and
fanny
mowbray
during
a
visit
of
some
months
at
her
scotch
castle
learned
to
think
of
her
religious
sufferings
with
sufficient
composure
to
enable
her
once
more
to
look
forward
as
well
as
around
her
with
hope
and
enjoyment
and
who
is
there
that
can
doubt
that
the
lovely
fanny
mowbray
with
recovered
senses
and
fifty
thousand
pounds
even
though
she
did
for
ever
abandon
her
poetic
pursuits
met
at
no
very
advanced
age
with
a
husband
worthy
of
her
the
two
tall
misses
richards
ceased
to
be
serious
as
soon
as
it
became
decidedly
at
wrexhill
to
be
so
and
in
process
of
time
they
too
married
leaving
their
charming
little
mother
leisure
to
cultivate
the
friendship
of
rosalind
who
retained
her
partiality
for
her
and
enjoyed
her
friendship
and
society
for
many
happy
years
need
it
be
said
that
rosalind
and
helen
were
married
on
the
same
day
so
it
was
however
and
edward
wallace
performed
the
ceremony
the
vicar
of
wrexhill
being
indisposed
indeed
the
air
of
the
vicarage
evidently
disagreed
with
him
but
by
the
influence
of
some
of
the
most
distinguished
of
his
party
both
in
religion
and
politics
he
soon
obtained
an
exchange
with
a
gentleman
who
held
preferment
in
the
fens
he
did
not
however
obtain
a
mitre
though
a
great
many
serious
people
declared
that
he
deserved
it
a
disappointment
which
was
perhaps
the
more
cutting
from
the
circumstance
of
jacob
having
joined
a
troop
of
strolling
players
and
as
he
was
not
sufficiently
successful
amongst
them
to
add
any
glory
thereby
to
the
family
name
the
loss
of
episcopal
honours
was
the
more
severely
felt
every
thing
else
i
think
went
just
as
it
ought
to
do
poor
miss
mimima
was
sent
off
to
her
mamma
who
never
again
ventured
to
show
her
face
at
wrexhill
probably
fearing
that
she
might
cease
to
be
considered
as
the
principal
person
of
the
village
mowbray
speedily
marsh
in
his
school
the
old
lawyer
and
apothecary
returned
the
serious
servants
retreated
before
the
returning
honest
ones
and
in
short
a
whole
flight
of
fanaticals
followed
their
incomparable
vicar
till
the
pretty
village
of
wrexhill
once
more
became
happy
and
gay
and
the
memory
of
their
serious
epidemic
rendered
its
inhabitants
the
most
orderly
peaceable
and
orthodox
population
in
the
whole
country
the
end
