book
has
been
written
in
tender
memory
of
a
dearly
loved
and
loving
child
henry
earle
junior
we
regard
the
large
share
which
child
study
has
in
the
interest
of
the
reader
and
thinker
of
it
is
indeed
curious
to
see
how
little
is
told
of
child
life
in
history
the
ancients
made
no
record
of
the
life
of
young
children
classic
rome
furnishes
no
data
for
child
study
the
greeks
left
no
child
forms
in
art
the
student
of
original
sources
of
history
learns
little
about
children
in
his
searches
few
in
number
and
comparatively
meagre
in
quality
are
the
literary
remains
that
even
refer
to
know
little
of
the
childhood
days
of
our
forbears
and
have
scant
opportunity
to
make
comparisons
or
note
progress
the
child
of
colonial
days
was
emphatically
to
be
seen
not
to
be
heard
nor
was
he
even
to
be
much
in
evidence
to
the
eye
he
was
of
as
little
importance
in
domestic
social
or
ethical
relations
as
his
childish
successor
is
of
great
importance
it
was
deemed
neither
courteous
decorous
nor
wise
to
make
him
appear
of
value
or
note
in
his
own
eyes
or
in
the
eyes
of
his
seniors
hence
there
was
none
of
that
exhaustive
study
of
the
motives
thoughts
and
acts
of
a
child
which
is
now
accounts
of
oldtime
child
life
gathered
for
this
book
are
wholly
unconscious
and
full
of
honesty
and
simplicity
not
only
from
the
attitude
of
the
child
but
from
that
of
his
parents
guardians
and
friends
the
records
have
been
made
from
affectionate
interest
not
from
scientific
interest
no
profound
search
has
been
made
for
motives
or
significance
but
the
proof
they
give
of
tenderness
and
affection
in
the
family
are
beautiful
to
read
and
to
quotations
from
manuscript
letters
records
diaries
and
accounts
which
are
here
given
could
only
have
been
acquired
by
precisely
the
method
which
has
been
followed
a
constant
and
distinct
search
for
many
years
combined
with
an
alert
watchfulness
for
items
or
even
hints
relating
to
the
subject
during
as
many
years
of
extended
historical
reading
many
private
collections
and
many
relics
have
been
freely
offered
for
use
and
nearly
all
the
sentences
and
pages
selected
from
these
sources
now
appear
in
print
for
the
first
time
the
portraits
of
children
form
a
group
as
rare
as
it
is
beautiful
they
are
specially
valuable
as
a
study
of
costume
nearly
all
of
these
also
are
as
true
emblems
of
the
generous
friendship
of
the
present
owners
as
they
are
of
the
life
of
the
past
the
rich
stores
of
our
many
historical
associations
of
the
essex
institute
the
american
antiquarian
society
the
long
island
historical
society
the
hall
the
lenox
library
have
been
generously
opened
carefully
gleaned
and
freely
used
the
expression
of
gratitude
so
often
tendered
to
these
helpful
kinsfolk
and
friends
and
to
these
bountiful
societies
and
libraries
can
scarcely
be
emphasized
by
any
public
thanks
yet
it
would
seem
that
for
such
assistance
thanks
could
never
be
offered
too
frequently
nor
too
have
i
in
gathering
for
this
as
for
my
other
books
failed
to
exercise
what
emerson
calls
the
catlike
love
of
garrets
presses
and
cornchambers
and
of
the
conveniences
of
long
housekeeping
many
homes
have
i
searched
many
an
old
garret
and
press
has
yielded
conveniences
for
this
this
is
a
record
of
the
life
of
children
in
the
american
colonies
i
have
freely
compared
the
conditions
in
this
country
with
similar
ones
in
england
at
the
same
date
both
for
the
sake
of
fuller
elucidation
and
also
to
attempt
to
put
on
a
proper
basis
the
civilization
which
the
colonists
left
behind
them
many
statements
of
conditions
in
america
do
not
convey
correct
ideas
of
our
past
comfort
and
present
and
liberal
progress
unless
we
compare
them
with
facts
in
english
life
we
must
not
overrate
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
century
life
in
england
either
in
private
or
public
england
was
not
a
power
among
nations
till
the
time
of
the
treaty
of
paris
in
when
our
colonies
were
settled
it
was
life
among
the
nobility
was
magnificent
but
the
life
of
the
peasantry
was
wretched
and
social
life
was
very
bleak
and
monotonous
in
both
city
and
country
from
early
days
life
was
much
better
in
many
ways
in
america
than
in
england
for
the
family
of
moderate
means
and
children
shared
the
benefits
of
these
better
conditions
a
child
life
was
more
valuable
here
the
colonial
laws
plainly
show
this
increased
valuation
and
the
child
responded
to
this
regard
of
him
by
a
growing
sense
of
his
own
importance
which
in
time
has
produced
young
america
is
my
hope
that
children
as
well
as
grown
folk
will
find
in
these
pages
much
to
interest
them
in
the
accounts
of
the
life
of
children
of
olden
times
i
have
had
this
end
constantly
in
my
mind
though
i
have
made
no
attempt
nor
had
i
any
intent
to
write
in
a
style
for
the
perusal
of
children
for
i
have
not
found
that
intelligent
children
care
much
or
long
for
such
books
except
in
the
very
rare
cases
of
the
few
great
books
that
have
been
written
for
children
and
which
are
loved
and
read
as
much
by
the
old
as
by
the
young
as
our
tired
century
has
grown
gray
it
has
developed
an
interest
in
things
youthful
in
the
beginnings
of
things
its
attitude
is
akin
to
that
of
an
old
man
still
in
health
and
but
weary
who
has
lived
through
his
scores
of
crowded
years
of
action
toil
and
strife
and
seeks
in
the
last
days
of
his
life
a
serene
and
peaceful
harbor
the
companionship
of
little
children
there
is
something
of
mystery
too
in
the
turn
of
the
century
something
which
then
makes
our
gaze
retrospective
and
comparative
rather
than
inquisitive
into
the
future
hence
this
year
of
our
lord
mdcccxcix
has
been
the
allotted
day
and
hour
for
the
writing
of
this
book
there
has
been
a
trend
of
destiny
which
has
brought
not
only
a
book
on
oldtime
child
life
and
that
book
at
this
century
end

has

one
fancy
chuckle
while
his
heart
doth
author
way
of
sending
forth
his
second
part
of
the
pilgrim
john
bunyan
there
is
something
inexpressibly
sad
in
the
thought
of
the
children
who
crossed
the
ocean
with
the
pilgrims
and
the
fathers
of
jamestown
new
amsterdam
and
boston
and
the
infancy
of
those
born
in
the
first
years
of
colonial
life
in
this
strange
new
world
it
was
hard
for
grown
folk
to
live
conditions
and
surroundings
offered
even
to
strong
men
constant
and
many
obstacles
to
the
continuance
of
existence
how
difficult
was
it
then
to
rear
children
in
the
southern
colonies
the
planters
found
a
climate
and
enforced
modes
of
life
widely
varying
from
home
life
in
england
it
took
several
generations
to
accustom
infants
to
thrive
under
those
conditions
the
first
years
of
life
at
plymouth
are
the
records
of
a
bitter
struggle
not
for
comfort
but
for
existence
scarcely
less
sad
are
the
pages
of
governor
winthrop
journal
which
tell
of
the
settlers
of
massachusetts
bay
on
the
journey
across
seas
not
a
child
had
shown
fear
or
dismayedness
those
brave
children
were
welcomed
to
the
shore
with
good
cheer
says
the
old
chronicler
joshua
scottow
with
external
flavor
and
sweet
odor
fragrant
was
the
land
such
was
the
plenty
of
sweet
fern
laurel
and
other
fragrant
simples
such
was
the
scent
of
our
aromatic
and
pines
spruces
and
larch
trees
with
our
tall
cedars
they
landed
on
a
beautiful
day
in
june
with
a
smell
on
the
shore
like
the
smell
of
a
garden
and
these
happy
children
had
gathered
sweet
wild
strawberries
and
single
wild
roses
it
is
easy
to
picture
the
merry
faces
and
cheerful
laughter
scant
alas
were
the
succeeding
days
of
either
sweetness
or

the
summer
wore
on
in
weary
work
in
which
the

had
to
join
in
constant
fears

hunger

not

child
life
was
in
harmony
with
its
surroundings
it
was
more
cheerful
but
there
was
still
fearful
menace
to
the
life
and
health
of
an
infant
from
the
moment
when
the
baby
opened
his
eyes
on
the
bleak
world
around
him
he
had
a
spartan
struggle
for
life
half
the
puritan
children
had
scarce
drawn
breath
in
this
vale
of
tears
ere
they
had
to
endure
an
ordeal
which
might
well
have
given
rise
to
the
expression
the
survival
of
the
fittest
i
say
half
the
babies
presuming
that
half
were
born
in
warm
weather
half
in
cold
all
had
to
be
baptized
within
a
few
days
of
birth
and
baptized
in
the
fortunate
indeed
was
the
child
of
midsummer
we
can
imagine
the
january
babe
carried
through
the
narrow
streets
or
lanes
to
the
freezing
which
had
grown
damper
and
deadlier
with
every
wintry
blast
there
to
be
christened

sometimes
the
ice
had
to
be
broken

of
his

four
days

shrinking
from
the
icy
water
but
crying
not
it
was
a
cold
and
disheartening
reception
these
children
had
into
the
puritan
church
many
lingered
but
a
short
time
therein
the
mortality
among
infants
was
appallingly
great
they
died
singly
and
in
little
groups
and
in
vast
companies
putrid
fevers
epidemic
influenzas
malignant
sore

the
laws
of
sanitation
were
absolutely
disregarded
because
unknown
drainage
there
was
none
nor
deemed
necessary
disinfection
was
feebly
desired
but
the
scanty
sprinkling
of
vinegar
was
the
only
expression
of
that
desire
isolation
of
contagious
diseases
was
proclaimed
but
the
measures
were
as
futile
when
the
disease
was
known
to
be
contagious
as
they
were
lacking
in
the
diseases
which
our
fathers
did
not
know
were
communicable
it
is
appalling
to
think
what
must
have
been
the
unbounded
production
and
nurture
of
disease
germs
and
we
can
paraphrase
with
truth
the
words
of
sir
thomas
browne
and
say
of
our
grandfathers
and
their
children
considering
the
thousand
roads
that
lead
to
death
i
do
thank
my
god
they
could
die
but
once
illustration
edward
winslow
it
is
heartrending
to
read
the
entries
in
many
an
old
family
bible
the
records
of
suffering
distress
and
blasted
hopes
until
this
century
these
sad
stories
may
be
found
there
lies
open
before
me
an
old
bible
with
the
record
of
my
family
he
had
sixteen
children
when
the
first
child
was
a
year
and
a
half
old
the
second
child
was
born
the
baby
was
but
four
days
old
when
the
older
child
died
five
times
did
that
mother
heart
bear
a
similar
cruel
loss
when
she
had
a
baby
in
her
arms
therefore
when
she
had
been
nine
years
married
she
had
one
living
child
and
five
little
graves
bore
record
of
her
sorrow
in
the
seventeenth
century
the
science
of
medicine
had
not
wholly
cut
asunder
from
astrology
and
necromancy
and
the
trusting
christian
still
believed
in
some
occult
influences
chiefly
planetary
which
governed
not
only
his
crops
but
his
health
and
life
hence
the
entries
of
births
in
the
bible
usually
gave
the
hour
and
minute
as
well
as
the
day
month
and
year
thus
could
be
accurately
calculated
what
favoring
or
planets
were
in
ascendency
at
the
time
of
the
child
birth
what
influences
he
would
have
to
encounter
in
life
the
belief
that
meteorological
and
astrological
conditions
affected
medicines
was
strong
in
all
minds
the
best
physicians
gravely
noted
the
condition
of
the
moon
when
gathering
herbs
and
simples
and
concocting
medicines
and
certain
drugs
were
held
to
be
powerless
at
certain
times
of
the
year
owing
to
planetary
influences
sympathetical
medicines
were
confidingly
trusted
and
tried
to
a
surprising
extent
upon
children
apparently
these
were
as
beneficial
as
our
modern
method
of
healing
by
the
insinuation
of
improved
health
we
can
not
wonder
that
children
died
when
we
know
the
nostrums
with
which
they
were
dosed
there
were
quack
medicines
which
held
sway
for
a
century
among
them
a
valuable
property
these
patented
or
rather
secret
medicines
had
a
formidable
rival
in
which
was
used
as
a
tonic
and
also
a
lotion
many
of
the
ingredients
and
extracts
used
in
domestic
medicines
were
incredibly
revolting
venice

was
a
nasty
and

compound

were
grievously
afflicted

curiously
enough
it
was

not

observation

physicians
are
generally
fearful
about
diping
when
ye
fever
is
hard
but
oftentimes
all
attemps
to
lower
it
without
diping
are
vain
experience
has
taught
me
that
these
fears
are
groundless
yt
many
have
about
diping
in
rickety
fevers
i
have
found
in
a
multitude
of
instances
of
diping
is
most
effectual
means
to
break
a
rickety
fever
these
directions
are
agreable
to
what
i
have
practiced
for
many
years
among
other
english
notions
thrust
upon
american
children
was
one
thus
advertised
in
newspapers
the
famous
anodyne
necklace
for
children
teeth
recommended
in
england
by
chamberlen
with
a
remedy
to
open
and
ease
the
foregums
of
teething
children
and
bring
their
teeth
safely
out
children
on
the
very
brink
of
the
grave
and
thought
past
recovery
with
their
teeth
fits
fevers
convulsions
hooping
and
other
violent
coughs
gripes
looseness
and
all
proceeding
from
their
teeth
who
can
not
tell
what
they
suffer
nor
make
known
their
pains
any
other
way
but
by
crying
and
moans
have
almost
miraculously
recovered
after
having
worn
the
famous
anodyne
necklace
but
one
night
time
a
mother
then
would
never
forgive
herself
whose
child
should
die
for
want
of
so
very
easy
a
remedy
for
its
teeth
and
what
is
particularly
remarkable
of
this
necklace
is
that
of
those
vast
numbers
who
have
had
this
necklace
for
their
children
none
have
made
any
complaints
but
express
how
glad
they
have
been
that
their
children
have
worn
it
whereas
if
they
had
not
had
it
they
believed
their
children
would
have
been
in
the
grave
all
means
having
been
used
in
vain
until
they
had
the
necklace
these
anodyne
necklaces
were
akin
to
the
medicated
belts
of
our
own
day
and
were
worn
as
children
still

were
continued

argued
that
woollen

naturally
not

this
argument
scarcely
is

the

as
their
portraits
and
a
series
of
such
portraits
of
successive
dates
will
be
given
in
these

many
of
them
are
asserted
to
be
by
the

few
are
by

trumbull
and
stuart
i
have
accepted
all
family
traditions
as
true
and
in
many
cases
believe
them
to
be
true
especially
since
there
were
few
painters
of
any
rank
in
the
community
and
no
others
who
could
paint
portraits
such
as
those
which
have
been
preserved
the
gilbert
stuarts
and
trumbulls
usually
have
some
authentic
pedigree
many
of
these
pictures
have
no
artist
signature
and
are
absolutely
valueless
as
works
of
art
and
probably
meritless
as
likenesses
but
as
records
of
costume
they
are
always
of
interest
and
historical
worth
there
is
a
certain
sweetness
in
some
of
these
portraits
they
are
stiff
and
flat
but
some
of
them
have
a
quaintness
that
reminds
me
of
the
angels
of
the
early
florentine
painters
they
have
little
grace
of
figure
but
the
details
of
costume
make
them
pleasing
even
if
they
are
not
beautiful
the
first
child
portrait
in
this
series
is
one
of
extraordinary
interest
it
is
opposite

and
has
never
before
been
given
to
the
public
it
is
the
reputed
miniature
of
the
pilgrim
father

edward

a
boy
about
six
years
of
age

would
be

the
only

to
whom
i
am
indebted
for
it
entitled
it
the
reputed
miniature
of
the
child
edward
winslow
though
the
term
expresses
neither
his
belief
nor
mine
and
seems
scarcely
just
to
a
portrait
whose
claims
to
authenticity
are
far
more
definite
than
those
of
many
of
the
family

that
have
descended

the
miniature
came
to
winslow
from

she
died
at
the
age

her
grandfather
assured
her
that
his
father
the
famous
general
john

received
the
likeness
from
his
father
the
grandson
of
edward
the
pilgrim
and
that
it
was
the
pilgrim
likeness
as
a
child
this
through
winslows
is
a
record
of
few
retellings
and
these
were
told
by
folk
to
be
trusted
the
winslows
were
gentlefolk
of
ample
means
such
as
were
likely
to
have
miniatures
painted
and
the
portrait
of
governor
winslow
when
years
of

now
in
pilgrim
hall
plymouth
is
the
sole
one
save
this
miniature
of
any
of
the
pilgrims
other
strong
evidence
is
the
extraordinary
resemblance
of
the
child
picture
to
the
portrait
the
same
brow
contour
of
face
and
other
similarity
there
is
something
in
the
child
portrait
that
is
singularly
suggestive
to
any
one
with
any
historical
imagination
the
simplicity
of
the
dress

arrangement
of

hair
show
the
influence
of
puritanism
as
i
look
at
it
i
can
fancy
yes
i
can
plainly
see
some
little
english
children
twenty
years
later
standing
on
that
crowded
historic
ship
looking
back
with
childish
serenity
at
the
home
they
were
leaving
and
then
greeting
as
cheerfully
and
trustingly
the
sad

they
disembarked

the
faces

have
thought
the

that

me
it

might
goe

inquire
for
the

gentleman
that
was
there
the
day
before
in
a
black
coat
and
speak
to

to
tell
the
gentleman
when
he
came
from
school
that
there
was
a
gallant
with
very
fine
clothes
and
a
sword
to
have
waited
upon
him
and
would
come
again
upon
sunday
next
but
this
was
not
all
there
was
great
contrivings
while
he
was
dressing
who
should
have
the
first
salute
but
he
sayd
if
old
joan
had
been
here
she
should
but
he
gave
it
to
me
to
quiett
them
all
they
were
very
fitt

he
looks
taller

prettyer
than
in
his

much
as

i
went
to
bury
and
everything
for
another
suitt

so
the

since

the

were
curiously
minute

were
tried

fined

vain
daughters

psisted
in

joined

in
solemn
warnings

the
portrait
of

has
a
special
interest
to
the

since
it
is
a
specimen
of
copley

was
seven
years

human
an
element

so
fully
in

that
i
give
it
it
is
from
an
old
letter
written
by
his
mother
during
a
visit
in

possibly
this
very
portrait

had
but
very
little
comfort
since

on
among
the

since
the

very
forward

be
about
threes
coming
up
as
mr
hide
tells

ride
behind
him
if

billey

got
four
guineas
apiece

costly

formal

broad
lace
collar
with
heavy
dress
never
playing

equal
fetiches

thin
shoes

stays
made

tightly
wrought
with

advertised
stays
jumps
gazzets
costrells

caushets

were
doubtless
corsets
for

appear
strait

i
have
been
told
of
tin
corsets
for
little
girls
but
i
have
never
seen
any
such
abominations
one
pair
of
stays
was
labelled
as
having
been
worn
by
a
boy
when
five
years
old
there
certainly
is
a
suspicious
suggestion
in
some
of
these
little

a
letter
is
given
describing
the
dress
of
two
young
girls
who
were
boarding
in
boston
while
they
were
being
taught
there
is
no
doubt
that
very
rich
dress
was
desired
and
possibly
required
of
these
young
the
letter
in

to

shows
the
elegance
of
dress
of
those
schoolgirls
she
had
twelve
silk
gowns
but
word
was
sent
home
to
norwich
that
a
recently
imported
rich
fabric
was
most
suitable
for
her
rank
and
station
and
in
answer
to
the
teacher
request
the
parents
ordered
the
purchase
of
this
elegant
dress
when
cotton
fabrics
from
oriental
countries
became
everywhere
and
every
time
worn
children
dress
as
likewise
that
of

folk
was
much
reduced

it
was

disappeared
and
heavy
petticoats
also
the
soft
slimsy
clinging

not

wore

did

strive

the

assisted
by
commanding
the
building

maintaining
of
a
school
in

where
there
was
a
sufficient
number

to
have

after

court
which
was
composed
of

gave
over
half
the
annual
income
of
the
entire

to
establish
the

this

in

as
the

this

correct

many

incensed

provide
a

could
be
taught

that
the
modern

these
statements
were
scarcely
carried
out
in

in
pennsylvania
educational
advantages
were
few
and
among

classes
education
was
sorely
hampered
the
quakers
did
not
encourage
absolute
illiteracy
but
they
thought
knowledge
of
the
three
r
was
enough
they
distinctly
disapproved
of
any
extended
scholarship
as
it
fostered
undue
pride

provoked
idleness

calvinist
and
lutheran
preachers
schlatter
and
muhlenberg
are

there
were
among

schools
of
low
grade
but
the
introduction
of
the
public
school
system
among
the
germans
was
resisted
by
indignation
meetings
and
litigation
the
tunkers
degenerated
so
that
they
did
not
desire

persons

ones
it
was
said
by
these
german
settlers
that
schooling
made
boys
lazy
and
dissatisfied
on
the
farms

that
religion
would
suffer
by
too
much
learning

poorly
the

was
deemed
of
vastly
less
importance
than
her
instruction
in

small

made

have
this

your

very
well

spare

me
to

i
very
much
long

doubt
whether
the

permit
i
pray
god
to
bless
you
and
make
you
one

i
charge
you
to
pray
daily
and
read
your
bible
and
fear
to
sin
be
very
dutiful
to
your
mother
and
respectful
to
everybody
be
very
humble

modest

and

take
care
of
your
health
and
as
you
love

do
not

the

be

when
i

saw
you
you
were

look

in

speak
freely
and
behave
decently
i
hope
to
bring

i
kiss

you
with

desire
thee
to
take
care
that
jonathan

lose
what

hath
learnt
but
that
as
he
hath
got
the
accidence
and
about
two
sides
of

by

so
that
he
keep
what
he
hath
got
i
would
therefore
have
him

pretty
often
to
the

i
would
also
have
the

keep
what
they
have
learnt
of
the
grammar
and
get
by
heart
as
far
as
jonathan
hath
learnt
he
can
keep
them
as
far
as
he
had
learnt
and
would
have
both
him
and
them
keep
their
writing
and
therefore
write
much
oftener
than
they
did
when
i
was
at

have
left

as

no
further
than

few
and
rare
instances
music
and

on
another
occasion
she
said
that

had
been

neglected
and

ridiculed
and
she

of
the
trifling
narrow
contracted
education
of

no
better
than

the
instruction
given
to
girls
of
dutch
and
english
parentage
in
new

was
certainly
very
meagre

wrote
an
interesting
account
of
her
childhood
in

new

in
a

called
of
an

the
date
was
the
first
half
of
the
eighteenth
century
she
said
it
was
at
that
time
very
difficult
to
procure
the
means
of
instruction
in
those
districts
female
education
was
in
consequence
conducted
on
a
very
limited
scale
girls
learned
needlework
in
which
they
were
indeed
both
skilful
and
ingenious
from
their
mothers
and
aunts
they
were
taught
too
at
that
period
to
read
in
dutch
the
bible
and
a
few
calvinistic
tracts
of
the
devotional
kind
but
in
the
infancy
of
the
settlement
few
girls
read
english
when
they
did
they
were
thought
accomplished
they
generally
spoke
it
however
imperfectly
and
a
few
were
taught
writing
william
smith
wrote
in
that
the
schools
in
new
york
then
were
of
the
lowest
order
the
teachers
ignorant
and
women
especially
it
was
the
same
in
virginia
mary
ball
the
mother
of
george
washington
wrote
from
her
virginia
home
when
fifteen
years
old
we
have
not
had
a
schoolmaster
in
our
neighborhood
till
now
in
nearly
four
years
we
have
now
a
young
minister
living
with
us
who
was
educated
at
oxford
took
orders
and
came
over
as
assistant
to
rev
kemp
the
parish

too
poor
to
keep

teaches

his

am
now
learning
pretty
fast

thus
summarily
and
definitely
sets
girls
in
their
proper
places
ought
female
children
to
receive
the
same
education
as
boys
and
have
the
same
scope
for
play
in
their
earlier
years
there
should
be
no
difference
but
there
are
shades
of
discretion
and
regards
to
propriety
which
judicious
and
prudent
guardians
and
teachers
can
discern
and
can
adjust
and
apply
we
seldom
find
any
recognition
of
girls
as
pupils
in
the
early
public
schools
sometimes
it
is
evident
that
they
were
admitted
at
times
not
devoted
to
the
teaching
of
boys
for
instance
in
may
a
school
was
advertised
in
providence
for
teaching
writing
and
arithmetic
to
young
ladies
but
the
girls
had
to
go
from
six
to
seven
in
the
morning
and
four
to
six
in
the
afternoon
the
price
for
this
most
inconvenient
and
schooling
was
two
dollars
a
quarter
it
is
pathetic
to
read
of
a
little
maid
in
hatfield
massachusetts
who
would
slip
away
from
her
spinning
and
knitting
and
sit
on
the
schoolhouse
steps
to
listen
with
eager
envy
to
the
boys
as
they
recited
within
when
it
became
popular
to
have
girls
attend
public
schools
an
old
farmer
on
a
country
school
committee
gave
these
objections
to
the
innovation
in
winter
it
too
far
for
girls
to
walk
in
summer
they
ought
to
stay
at
home
to
help
in
the
kitchen
the
first
school
for
girls
only
where
they
were
taught
in
branches
not
learned
in

in

boston
girls
owed
much
to
a
famous
teacher
caleb
bingham
who
came
to
that
city
in
and
advertised
to
open
a
school
where
girls
could
be
taught
writing
arithmetic
reading
spelling
and
english
grammar
his
school
was
eagerly
welcomed
and
it
prospered
he
wrote
for
his

pupils

to
in
another
chapter
and
under
his
teaching
newspapers
were
to
be
introduced
in
the
school
at
the
discretion
of
the
master
this
is
the
first
instance
i
believe
in
any
country
of
the
reading
of
newspapers
being
ordered
by
a
school
committee
there
were
always
which
were
attended
by
small

year

in
the
latter
part
of

my
mistress
had
made
me
a
sort
of
usher
appointing
me
to
teach
some
children
that
were
older
than
myself
as
well
as
some
smaller
ones
and
in
which
time
i
had
read
my
bible
through
thrice
my
parents
thought
me
to
be
weakly
because
of
my
thin
habit
and
pale
countenance
the
penultimate
sentence
of
this
account
evidently
accounts
for
the
ultimate

also
appears
that
this
unnamed

practised
the

century
or
more

it
never

their
own

all
even
to
loading

signifies
it
to
worry
ourselves
about
beings
that
are

will
be
just
so
i
can
and
do
pity
and
advise
but
i
shall
get
no
credit
by
the
eldest
talks

of
learning

the

dresden
the
french
tongue
the
younger
with
an
air
of
her
own
advis
the
elder
when
she
first
mention
french
to
learn
first
to
read
english
and
was
answer
so
i
can
well
you
heard
her
do
what
she
calls
reading
i
believe
poor
creature
well
we
have
a
time
of
it
there
is
a
beautifully
written
letter
in
existence
of
elizabeth
saltonstall
sent
to
her
young
daughter
elizabeth
on
july
when
the
latter
was
away
from
home
and
attending
school
it
abruptly
begins
betty
having
an
opportunity
to
send
to
you
i
could
doe
no
less
than
write
a
few
lines
to
mind
you
that
you
carry
yourself
very
respectively
and
dutyfully
to
graves
as
though
she
were
your
mother
and
likewise
respectively
and
loveingly
to
the
children
and
soberly
in
words
and
actions
to
the
servants
and
be
sure
you
keep
yourself
diligently
imployed
either
at
home
or
at
school
as
graves
shall
order
you
doe
nothing
without
her
leave
and
assure
yourself
it
will
be
a
great
preservative
from
falling
into
evill
to
keep
yourself
well
imployed
but
with
all
and
in
the
first
place
make
it
your
dayly
work
to
pray
earnestly
to
god
that
he
would
keep
you
from
all
manner
of
evil
take
heed
of
your
discourse
at
all
times
that
it
be
not
vaine
and
foolish
but
know
that
for
every
idle
word
you
must
certainly
give
account
another
day
be
sure
to
follow
your
reading
omit
it
not
one
day
your
father
doth
propose
to
send
you
some
coppies
that
so
you
may
follow
your
wrighting
likewise
i
shall
say
no
more
at
present
but
only
lay
a
strict
charge
upon
you
that
you
remember
and
practise
what
i
have
minded
you
of
and
as
you
desire
the
blessing
of
god
upon
you
either
in
soul
or
body
be
careful
to
observe
the
counsell
of
your
parents
and
consider
that
they
are
the
words
of
your
loving
and
affectionate
mother
eliz
saltonstall
present
my
best
respects
to
mistris
graves
your
brothers
remember
their
love
to
you
old
madam
coleman
who
had
somewhat
of
a
handful
in
her
grandson
richard
hall
during
his
school
days
was
given
charge
of
his
sister
sarah
in
to
care
for
and
guard
while
she
received
an
education
when
missy
arrived
from
the
barbadoes
she
was
eight
years
old
she
brought
with
her
a
maid
the
grandmother
wrote
back
cheerfully
to
the
parents
that
the
child
was
well
and
brisk
as
indeed
she
was
all
the
very
young
gentlemen
and
young
ladies
of
boston
brahmin
blood
paid
her
visits
and
she
gave
a
feast
at
a
child
dancing
party
with
the
sweetmeats
left
over
from
her
her
stay
in
her
grandmother
household
was
surprisingly
brief
she
left
unceremoniously
and
unbidden
with
her
maid
and
went
to
a
binning
to
board
she
sent
home
word
to
the
barbadoes
that
her
grandmother
made
her
drink
water
with
her
meals
her
brother
wrote
at
once
in
return
to
madam
coleman
we
were
all
persuaded
of
your
tender
and
hearty
affection
to
my
sister
when
we
recommended
her
to
your
parental
care
we
are
sorry
to
hear
of
her
independence
in
removing
from
under
the
benign
influences
of
your
wing
am
surprised
she
dare
do
it
without
our
leave
or
consent
or
that
binning
receive
her
at
his
house
before
he
knew
how
we
were
affected
to
it
we
shall
now
desire
binning
to
resign
her
with
her
waiting
maid
to
you
and
in
our
letter
to
him
have
strictly
ordered
her
to
return
to
your
house
and
you
may
let
her
know
before
my
father
took
his
departure
for
london
he
desired
me
peremptorily
to
enjoin
it
and
my
mother
and
myself
back
it
with
our
commands
which
we
hope
she
wont
venture
to
refuse
or
disobey
but
no
brother
could
control
this
spirited
young
damsel
three
months
later
a
letter
from
madam
coleman
read
thus
sally
wont
go
to
school
nor
to
church
and
wants
a
nue
muff
and
a
great
many
other
things
she
do
need
i
tell
her
fine
things
are
cheaper
in
barbadoes
she
says
she
will
go
to
barbados
in
the
spring
she
is
well
and
brisk
says
her
brother
has
nothing
to
do
with
her
as
long
as
her
father
is
alive
hugh
hall
wrote
in
return
saying
his
daughter
ought
to
have
one
room
to
sleep
in
and
her
maid
another
that
it
was
not
befitting
children
of
their
station
to
drink
water
they
should
have
wine
and
beer
the
grandmother
was
not
offended
with
him
or
the
children
but
shielded
the
boy
from
rebuke
when
he
was
sent
from
one
school
to
another
said
proudly
he
was
a
child
of
great
parts
ye
best
dancer
of
any
in
town
and
could
learn
as
much
in
an
hour
as
another
in
three
hours
the
bill
for
the
dancing
lessons
still
exists
richard
dancing

for
a
year
and
a
quarter
cost
seven
pounds
sally
for
four
months
two
pounds
four
instruction
in
writing
and
pens
ink
and
paper
was
one
pound
seven
shillings
and
four
pence
the
entrance
fee
for
dancing
lessons
was
a
pound
apiece
sally
learned
to
sew
floure
write
and
dance
the
brisk
child
grew
up
a
dashing
belle
and
married
major
john
wentworth
brother
of

benning
wentworth
good
brother
richard
writes
i
heartily
rejoice
in
sally
good
fortune
and
hope
molly
will
have
her
turn
also
but
it
would
not
have
been
fair
to
let
sally
dance
barefoot
which
i
hear
molly
expected
would
have
been
done
sister
molly
married
first
adam
winthrop
and
then
captain
william
wentworth
the
two
sisters
were
left
widows
and
lived
till
great
old
age
in
the
famous
old
wentworth
house
in
portsmouth
new
hampshire
both
dying
in
mistress
agan
blair
of
williamsburg
virginia
married
one
colonel
john
banister
of
petersburg
her
letters
even
in
old
age
are
full
of
a
charming
freedom
of
description
and
familiarity
of
language
even
amounting
to
slang
which
are
very
unusual
in
correspondence
of
that
day
they
are
printed
in
the
of
the
blair
and
braxton
she
writes
to
her
sister
braxton
of
the
little
daughter
betsey
in
the
year
betsey
is
at
work
for
you
i
suppose
she
will
tell
you
is
dancing
day
for
it
is
in
her
thoughts
by
day
her
dreams
by
night
fearson
was
so
surprised
to
find
she
knew
so
much
of
the
minuet
step
and
could
not
help
asking
if
miss
had
never
been
taught
so
you
will
find
she
is
likely
to
make
some
progress
that
way
wray
by
reason
of
business
has
but
lately
taken
her
in
hand
tho
he
assures
me
a
little
practice
is
all
she
wants
her
reading
i
hear
twice
a
day
and
when
i
go
out
she
is
consigned
over
to
my
sister
blair
we
have
had
some
few
quarrels
and
one
battle
betsey
and
her
cousin
jenny
had
been
fighting
for
several
days
successively
was
threatened
to
be
whipt
for
it
as
often
but
they
did
not
regard
us
her
mamma
self
thought
it
necessary
to
let
them
see
we
were
in
earnest
if
they
have
fought
since
we
have
never
heard
of
it
she
has
finish
her
work
tucker
but
ye
weather
is
so
warm
that
with
all
ye
pains
i
can
take
with
clean
hands
and
so
forth
she
can
not
help
dirtying
it
a
little
i
do
not
observe
her
to
be
fond
of
negroes
company
nor
have
i
heard
lately
of
any
bad
words
chief
of
our
quarrels
is
for
eating
of
those
green
apples
in
our
garden
and
not
keeping
the
head
smooth
i
have
had
hair
put
on
miss
dolly
but
find
it
is
not
in
my
power
of
complying
with
my
promise
in
giving
her
silk
for
a
sacque
and
coat
some
of
our
pretty
gang
broke
open
a
trunk
in
my
absence
and
stole
several
things
of
which
the
silk
makes
a
part
so
imagine
betsey
will
petition
you
for
some
i
am
much
obliged
for
the
care
you
have
taken
to
get
all
my
duds
together
i
can
not
find
you
have
neglected
putting
up
anything
for
betsey
it
will
readily
be
seen
from
all
these
letters
that
whether
the
little
girl
was
taught
at
home
or
in
a
private
school
to
sew
floure
write
and
dance
were
really
the
chief
things
she
learned
usually
the
only
things
save
deportment
and
elegance
of
carriage
to
attain
an
erect
and
dignified
bearing
growing
girls
were
tortured
as
in
english
boarding
schools
by
sitting
in
stocks
wearing
harnesses
and
being
strapped
to
backboards
the
packthread
stays
and
stiffened
coats
of
little
miss
custis
were
made
still
more
unyielding
by
metal
and
wood
busks
the
latter
made
of
heavy
wood
these
were
often
carved
in
various
designs
or
with
names
and
verses
or
ornamented
with
drawings
in
colored
inks
and
made
a
favorite
gift
illustration
carved
busks
all
these
constrainments
and
accessories
contributed
to
a
certain
though
erect
appearance
which
is
notable
in
the
portraits
of
girls
and
women
painted
in
the
past
century
the
backboard
certainly
helped
to
produce
an
erect
and
dignified
carriage
and
was
assisted
by
the
quick
graceful
motions
used
in
the
daughter
of
the
revolutionary
patriot
general
nathanael
greene
stated
to
her
grandchildren
that
in
her
girlhood
she
sat
every
day
with
her
feet
in
stocks
strapped
to
a
backboard
she
was
until
the
end
of
her
long
life
a
elegant
dame
many
of
the
portraits
given
in
this
book
plainly
show
the
reign
of
the
backboard
the
portrait
of
elizabeth
storer
facing
page
is
perhaps
the
best
example
it
is
authenticated
as
having
been
painted
by
smibert
when
the
subject
was
but
twelve
years
old
but
she
is
certainly
a
most
child
another
portrait
opposite
page
is
the
famous
one
immortalized
in
rhyme
by
oliver
wendell
holmes
that
of
dorothy
the
daughter
of
judge
edmund
quincy
the
poet
lines
are
more
simply
descriptive
than
any
prose
grandmother
mother
her
age
i
guess
thirteen
summers
or
something
less
girlish
bust
but
womanly
air
smooth
square
forehead
with
uprolled
hair
lips
that
lover
has
never
kissed
taper
fingers
and
slender
wrist
hanging
sleeves
of
stiff
brocade
so
they
painted
the
little
maid
who
the
painter
was
none
may
tell
one
whose
best
was
not
over
well
hard
and
dry
it
must
be
confessed
flat
as
a
rose
that
has
long
been
pressed
yet
in
her
cheek
the
hues
are
bright
dainty
colors
of
red
and
white
and
in
her
slender
shape
are
seen
hint
and
promise
of
stately
mien
it
would
be
no
effort
of
the
imagination
to
stretch
the
thirteen
summers
or
less
to
thirty
summers
illustration
dorothy
q
thirteen
summers
of
associate
interest
is
the
portrait
of
elizabeth
quincy
her
sister
facing
page
the
faces
hair
and
dress
are
similar
but
the
parrot
is
replaced
by
an
impossible
little
dog
elizabeth
is
somewhat
fairer
to
look
upon
dorothy
is
certainly
nothing
handsome
on
the
back
of
the
portrait
is
written
this
inscription
it
pleased
god
to
take
out
of
life
my
honor
and
dearly
mother
elizabeth
wendell
daughter
to
honble
edmund
quincy
march
aged
years
her
brother
edmund
quincy
married
her
husband
sister
elizabeth
thus
the
two
elizabeths
exchanged
surnames
and
dorothy
married
edward
jackson
the
desire
of
girls
and
women
to
be
ethereal
and
slender
delicate
and
shrinking
began
over
a
century
ago
but
reached
a
climax
in
the
early
years
of
this
century
to
effect
this
severe
measures
were
taken
in
girls
schools
holmes
wrote
in
jest
but
in
truth
too
they
braced
my
aunt
against
a
board
to
make
her
straight
and
tall
they
laced
her
up
they
starved
her
down
to
make
her
light
and
small
they
pinched
her
feet
they
singed
her
hair
they
screwed
it
up
with
pins
oh
never
mortal
suffered
more
in
penance
for
her
sins
though
madam
coleman
a
boston
puritan
told
so
proudly
of
her
grandchildren
dancing
that
accomplishment
or
rather
integral
part
of
a
little
lass
education
had
not
been
quietly
promoted
in
that
sober
city
in
early
years
both
magistrates
and
ministers
had
declaimed
against
it
in
increase
mather
preached
a
strong
sermon
against
what
he
termed
gynecandrical
dancing
or
that
which
is
commonly
called
mixt
or
promiscuous
dancing
of
men
and
women
be
they
elder
or
younger
persons
together
he
called
it
the
great
sin
of
the
daughters
of
zion
and
he
bursts
forth
who
were
the
inventors
of
petulant
dancings
learned
men
have
well
observed
that
the
devil
was
the
first
inventor
of
the
impleaded
dances
and
the
gentiles
who
worshipped
him
the
first
practitioners
of
this
art
of
course
he
could
not
be
silent
as
to
the
dancings
of
miriam
and
david
in
the
bible
but
disposed
of
them
summarily
thus
those
instances
are
not
at
all
to
the
purpose
preaching
against
dancing
was
as
futile
as
against
horrid
bushes
of
vanity
soon
decked
every
head
and
gay
young
feet
tripped
merrily
to
the
sound
of
music
in
every
village
and
town
dancing
could
not
be
repressed
in
an
age
when
there
was
so
little
other
excitement
so
great
physical
activity
and
so
narrow
a
range
of
conversation
and
after
a
time
were
given
when
a
new
minister
was
ordained
dancing
was
a
pleasant
accomplishment
and
a
serious
one
in
good
society
the
regard
of
it
as
a
formal
function
is
proved
by
the
story
the
marquis
de
chastellux
told
of
the
philadelphia
assembly
a
young
lady
who
was
up
in
a
country
dance
spoke
for
a
moment
to
a
friend
and
thus
forgot
her
turn
the
master
of
ceremonies
colonel
mitchell
immediately
came
to
her
side
and
said
severely
give
over
miss
take
care
what
you
are
about
do
you
think
you
came
here
for
your
pleasure
it
was
a
much
more
varied
art
than
is
ordinarily
taught
signor
sodi
taught
rigadoons
and
paspies
in
philadelphia
john
walsh
added
the
spanish
fandango
other
modish
dances
were

many
in
number

a
letter
from
an
interesting
little

that

was
deemed
part
of
a
liberal
education
philadelphia
march
honour
sir
since
my
coming
up
i
have
entered
with
hackett
to
improve
my
dancing
and
hope
to
make
such
progress
therein
as
may
answer
to
the
expense
and
enable
me
to
appear
well
in
any
public
company
the
great
desire
i
have
of
pleasing
you
will
make
me
the
more
assiduous
in
my
undertaking
and
i
arrive
at

we
have
much
contemporary
evidence
to
show
that
music
as
a
formulated
study
was
rarely
taught
till
after
the
revolution
but
there
never
was
a
time
in
colonial
life
when
music
was
not
loved
and
clung
to
with
a
sentiment
that
is
difficult
of
explanation
but
must
not
be
underrated

how
very
elementary
were
the
performances
on
these
instruments
listeners
were
profoundly
moved
at

it
would
seem

from
inspiring
the

of
slender

i

again
placed

of
an
amiable
lady
so
mild
so
good
no
one
can
help
loving
her
she
treats
all
her
scholars
with
such
tenderness
as
would
win
the
affection
of
the
most
savage
brute

at

wish
your

is
the
worst

i
ever
knew
of

that
i
ever
saw
nobody
knows
what

suffered
from
the
treatment
of
that

this
lyman
kept
a
boarding
school
at
medford
eight
girls
slept
in
one
room
the
fare
was
meagre
and
the
education
kept
close
company
with
the
fare
the
moravian
schools
at
bethlehem
pennsylvania
were
widely
popular
president
john
adams
wrote
to
his
daughter
of
the
school
that
one
hundred
and
twenty
girls
lived
in
one
house
and
slept
in
one
garret
in
single
beds
in

long
rows

you

eliza
southgate
bowne
wrote
a
pretty
account
of
this
school
the
first
was
merely
a
little
children
and
a
pretty
single
sister
about
with
her
white
skirt
white
short
tight
waistcoat
nice
handkerchief
pinned
outside
a
muslin
apron
and
a
close
cap
of
the
most
singular
form
you
can
imagine
i
ca
describe
it
the
hair
is
all
put
out
of
sight
turned
back
and
no
border
to
the

very
unbecoming
and
very
singular
tied
under
the
chin
with
a
pink
ribbon
blue
for
the

white
for

widows
here
was
a
piano
forte
and
another
sister
teaching
a
little
girl
music
we
went
all
the
different
school
rooms
some
misses
of
sixteen
their
teachers
were
very
agreeable
and
easy
and
in
every
room
was
a
piano
she
also
tells
of
the
great
dormitory
the
beds
of
singular
shape
high
and
covered
a
single
lighted
at
night
with
one
sister
walking
patrol
though
the
education
given
to
girls
in
these
boarding
schools
was
not
very
profound
they
had
at
the
close
of
the
school
year
a
grand
opportunity
of

when
thirteen
years
old
to

from

i
went
to

there
were
five
crowns
two
principal

they
were
crowned
in
great
style
in

quincy
wrote
of
a
school
which
she
attended
in
of
what
she
termed
the
breaking
up
a
stage
was
erected
at
the
end
of
the
room
covered
with
a
carpet
ornamented
with
evergreens
and
lighted
by
candles
in
gilt
branches
two
window
curtains
were
drawn
aside
from
the
centre
before
it
and
the
audience
were
seated
on

also
sung
a
song
intended
in
the
play
for
one
of
the
daughters
of
urania
but
as
i
had
the
best
voice
it
was
given
to
me
my
dress
was
a
pink

green
striped
silk

and
flowers
decorated
my
head
and
with
bracelets
on
my
arms
and
paste

on

thought
i
made
a
splendid
appearance
the
only
time
i
ever
rode
in

was
on
this
occasion
when
after
being

at

were
then

i
acted

by
some
strange
notion
of

or
my
own
was
dressed
in
a
gown
cap
handkerchief
and
apron
of
my
mother
with
a
pair
of
spectacles
to
look
like
an
elderly
woman
a
proof
how
little
we
understood
the
character
of
a
french
milliner
when
the
curtain
was
drawn
many
of
the
audience
declared
it
must
be
morton
herself
on
the
stage
how
my
mother
with
her
strict
notions
and
prejudices
against
the
theatre
ever
consented
to
such
proceedings
is
still
a
surprise
to
me
all
parents
did
not
approve
of
those
exhibitions
major
dulany
wrote
with
decision
to
his
daughter
that
he
lamented
the
boldness
and
which
accompanied
any
success
in
such
performances
and
which
proceeded
he
deemed
from
callous
feeling
these
plays
were
merely
a
revival
of
an
old
fashion
when
english
school
children
took
part
in
miracle
plays
or
mysteries
in
the
seventeenth
century
schoolmasters
took
great
pride
in
writing
exhibition
plays
for
their
pupils
dreary
enough

interludes

john
bunyan
the
english
philosopher
john
locke
in
his
concerning
written
in
says
the
method
of
teaching
children
to
read
in
england
at
that
time
was
always
the
ordinary
road
of
primer
psalter
testament
and
bible
these
he
said
engage
the
liking
of
children
and
tempt
them
to
read
the
road
was
the
same
in
new
england
but
it
would
hardly
be
called
a
tempting
method
the
first
book
from
which
the
children
of
the
colonists
learned
their
letters
and
to
spell
was
not
really
a
book
at
all
in
our
sense
of
the
word
it
was
what
was
called
a
hornbook
a
thin
piece
of
wood
usually
about
four
or
five
inches
long
and
two
inches
wide
had
placed
upon
it
a
sheet
of
paper
a
trifle
smaller
printed
at
the
top
with
the
alphabet
in
large
and
small
letters
below
were
simple
syllables
such
as
ab
eb
ib
ob
etc
then
came
the
prayer
this
printed
page
was
covered
with
a
thin
sheet
of
yellowish
horn
which
was
not
as
transparent
as
glass
yet
permitted
the
letters
to
be
read
through
it
and
both
the
paper
and
the
horn
were
fastened
around
the
edges
to
the
wood
by
a
narrow
strip
of
metal
usually
brass
which
was
tacked
down
by
fine
tacks
or
nails
it
was
therefore
a
book
of
a
single
page
at
the
two
upper
corners
of
the
page
were
crosses
hence
to
read
the
hornbook
was
often
called
reading
a
row
at
the
lower
end
of
the
wooden
back
was
usually
a
little
handle
which
often
was
pierced
with
a
hole
thus
the
hornbook
could
be
carried
by
a
string
which
could
be
placed
around
the
neck
or
hung
by
the
side

when
five
years

was
published
my
book
entitled
and
fashions
in

i
wrote
that
i
did
not
know
of
the
preservation
of
a
single
hornbook
in
america
though
for
many
years
eager
and
patient
antiquaries
of
english
and
of
american
blood
had
vainly
sought
in
american
historical
collections
in
american
libraries
in
american
rural
homes
for
a
true
american
hornbook
that
is
one
studied
by
american
children
of
colonial
times
the
publication
of
my
statement
has
made
known
to
me
three
american
hornbooks
the
first
is
the
shabby
little
treasure
owned
by
anne
robinson
minturn
of
shoreham
vermont
found
hidden
under
the
dusty
eaves
of
a
vermont
garret
the
illustration
shows
its
exact
size
on
the
back
is
a
paper
coarsely
stamped
in
red
with
a
portrait
of
charles
king
of
england
on
horseback
this
may
indicate
its
age
but
not
its
exact
date
the
young
colonist
who
owned
it
was
by
this
print
taught
loyalty
to
the
crown
though
in
a
far
land
the
second
hornbook
is
owned
by
miss
grace
gordon
of
flushing
long
island
it
is
a
family
heirloom
having
come
to
its
present
owner
through
a
who
was
born
in
and
stated
that
it
was
used
by
his
father
who
was
born
in
the
tablet
is
of
oak
and
the
back
is
covered
with
a
red
paper
stamped
with
the
design
of
a
eagle
the
third

by

their

is
it
strange
that
these
three
lonely
little
ghosts
of
schooling
should
be
the
only
representatives
of
their
regiments
of
classmates
would
it
seem
that
tender
association
or
miserly
hoarding
or
even
forgetful
neglect
would
have
made
some
greater
salvage
from
the
vast
number
of
hornbooks
sent
to
this
country
in
the
century
after
its
settlement
that
by
intent
or
accident
many
scores
would
have
survived

are
all

battered
oaken

what

become
a

in

it
it

all
that
the
massachusetts
statutes

the

be
dignified
by
the
pompous
name
of

pointer
and
something
of
that
nature

straw
a
pin
a
quill
a
skewer
of
wood
was
always
used
to
direct
children
eyes

certainly
were
plenty
of
these
humble

so
says

pretty

what
more
could

wished

than
to
be
able
to
read

spell
to
repeat
that
holy
charm
before

fled
all
unholy
ghosts
goblins
or
even

countless
myriads

account
of
the
hornbook
readers
should
go

the
of

by
andrew

splendid
volumes
forming
one
of
the
most
interesting
and
exhaustive
accounts
of
any
special
educational
topic
that
has
ever
been
written
the
printed
cardboard
battledore
was
a
successor

was
often
printed
on
a
double
fold
of
stiff
card
with
a
third
fold
or
flap
lapping
over
like

old
these
battledores
were

in
such
vast
numbers
that
it
is
futile

attempt
even
to
allude
to
the
myriad
of
publishers
an
affine

it
was
frequently

much
used
more

three
million

of

were

declares

that
those

before

learned
to

from
one
of
these
little

it
was
so
religious
in
all
its

and
suggestions
that
it
has
been
fitly
called
the
little

a
poorly

little
book
about
five
inches
long

a
short

of
easy
syllables
such
as
ab

and
words
up
to
those
of
six
syllables
this
was
called
a
syllabarium
there
were
twelve
words
of
these
five
were
and
there
were
a
morning
and
evening
prayer
for
children
and
a
grace
to
be
said
before
meat
then
followed
a
set
of
little
rhymes
which
have
become
known
everywhere
and
are
frequently
quoted

of

is
illustrated

john

after
the
year
a
few
very
short
stories
were
added
to
its
pages
and
were
probably
all
the
children
stories
that
many
of
the
scholars
of
that
day
ever
saw
it
is
interesting
to
see
that
the
little
prayer
so
well
known
beginning
now

lay

is
usually
found
in
the
england
of
dates
later
than
the
year
the
was
perhaps
the
most
important
part
of
this
primer
it
was
so
called
in
contrast
to
the
catechism
in
use
in
england
called
careful
father
and
pious
which
had
twelve
hundred
questions
with
answers
the
had
but
a
hundred
and
seven
questions
though
some
of
the
answers
were
long
usually
another
catechism
was
found
in
the
primer
called
milk
for
it
was
written
by
the
boston
minister
john
cotton
and
it
had
but
questions
with
short
answers
sometimes
a

christ
youth
and
the
was
added
the
was
the
special
delight
of
all
new
englanders
cotton
mather
called
it
a
little
watering
pot
to
shed
good
lessons
he
begged
writing
masters
to
set
sentences
from
it
to
be
copied
by
their
pupils
and
he
advised
mothers
to
continually
drop
something
of
the
catechism
on
their
children
as
honey
from
the
rock
learning
the
catechism
was
enforced
by
law
in
new
england
and
the
deacons
and
ministers
visited
and
examined
families
to
see
that
the
law
was
obeyed
thus
it
may
plainly
be
seen
that
this
primer
truly
filled
the
requisites
of
what
the
roxbury
school
trustees
called
scholastical

moral
discipline

to
find
a
new
york
teacher
advertising
to
teach
writeing
and
spilling
to
show
that
a
fetich
was
made
of
spelling
years
ago
i
give
this
extract
from
a
danbury
school
notice
the
advantages
that
small
children
obtain
at
this
school
may
be
easily
imagined
when
the
public
are
informed
that
those
who
spell
go
through
the
whole
of
webster
spelling
book
twice
a
fortnight
the
teaching
of
spelling
in
many
schools
was
peculiar
the
master
gave
out
the
word
with
a
blow
of
his
strap
on
the
desk
as
a
signal
for
all
to
start
together
and
the
whole
class
spelled
out
the
word
in
syllables
in
chorus
the
teacher
ear
was
so
trained
and
acute
that
he
at
once
detected
any
misspelling
if
this
happened
he
demanded
the
name
of
the
scholar
who
made
the
mistake
if
there
was
any
hesitancy
or
refusal
in
acknowledgment
he
kept
the
whole
class
until
by
repeated
trials
of
long
words
accuracy
was
obtained
the
roar
of
the
many
voices
of
the
large
school
all
pitched
in
different
keys
could
be
heard
on
summer
days
for
a
long
distance
in
many
country
schools
the
scholars
not
only
spelled
aloud
but
studied
all
their
lessons
aloud
as
children
in
oriental
countries
do
and
the
teacher
was
quick
to
detect
any
lowering
of
the
volume
of
sound
and
would
reprove
any
child
who
was
studying
silently
sometimes
the
combined
roar
of
voices
became
offensive
to
the
neighbors
of
the
school
and
restraining
votes
were
passed
at
the
colonial
school
and
schoolmaster
took
a
firm
stand
on
cyphering
the
bible
and
figgers

all

want
my
boys
to
know
said
an
old
farmer
arithmetic
was
usually
taught
without
teachers
had
manuscript
from
which
they
gave
out
rules
and
problems
in
arithmetic
to
their
scholars
abraham

learned
arithmetic
from
a
of
which
he
made
a
neat
copy
a
page
from
this
is
here
given
in
reduced
size
too
often
these
sums
were
copied
by
the
pupil
without
any
explanation
of
the
process
being
offered
or
rendered
by
the
master
the
artist
trumbull
recalled
that
he
spent
three
weeks
unaided
in
any
way
over
a
single
sum

could
be
invented

many
scholars
never
saw
a

arithmetic
and
when
the

had
one
for
circulation
it
was
scarcely
more
helpful
than
the
one
of
the
most
ancient
arithmetics
was
written
by
the
mathematician
record
who
lived
from
the
year
to
he
is
said
to
have
invented
the
sign
of
equality
but
there
is
nothing
in
his
book
to
indicate
this
fact
the
terms
arsemetrick
and
augrime
are
used
in
it
instead
of
arithmetic
many
curious

obsolete
rules
are

as

most
noble
shakespeare
it
is
hard
indeed
to
idealize
or
write
poetical
tributes
to
one
by
the
name
of
cocker
it
gives
us
a
sense
of
pleasant
familiarity
with
any
one
to
know
that
he
is
well
acquaint
with
one
of

so
i
feel
much
drawn

ingenious
cocker

knowing
that
he
was
well

pepys
he
was
a
writing
master
and
did
some
mighty
fine
engraving
for
pepys
who
calls
him
ingenuous
not
ingenious
it
is
rather
a
facer
to
learn
from
the
notes
in
the
diary
that
cocker
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
his
arithmetic
which
was
a

a
collection
of
pleasant
and
polite
questions
to
exercise
all
the
parts
of
vulgar
arithmetick
here
is
one
this
problem
is
usually
propounded
in
this
manner
viz
fifteen
and
fifteen
being
at
sea
in
one
and
the
same
ship
in
a
terrible
storm
the
pilot
declaring
a
necessity
of
casting
the
one
half
of
those
persons
into
the
sea
that
the
rest
might
be
saved
they
all
agreed
that
the
persons
to
be
cast
away
should
be
set
out
by
lot
after
this
manner
viz
the
thirty
persons
should
be
placed
in
a
round
form
like
a
and
then
beginning
to
count
at
one
of
the
passengers
and
proceeding
circularly
every
ninth
person
should
be
cast
into
the
sea
until
of
the
thirty
persons
there
remained
only
fifteen
the
question
is
how
those
thirty
persons
ought
to
be
placed
that
the
lot
might
infallibly
fall
upon
the
fifteen
not
upon
any
of
the
fifteen
for
the
more
easie
remembering
of
the
rule
to
resolve
this
question
shall
presuppose
the
five
vowels

to

to

i

will
the
rule
it
self
be
briefly
comprehended
in
these
two
following
verses
from
numbers
aid
and
art
never
will
fame
depart
in
which
verses
you
are
principally
to
observe
the
vowels
with
their
correspondent
numbers
before
assigned
and
then
beginning
with
the
the
vowel
in

that
four
are

in
in
in

in
in
the
invention
of
the
said
rule
and
such
like
dependeth
upon
the
subsequent
demonstration
viz
if
the
number
of
persons
be
thirty
let
thirty
figures
or
cyphers
be
placed
circularly
or
else
in
a
right
line
as
you
see
ooooooooooooooo
i
trust
the
little
winslows
and
their
neighbors
understood
this
sum
and
its
explanation
and
that
the
christians
were
all
saved
and
the
turks
were
all
drowned
geography

an
accomplishment
rather
than

were
made

glancing
over
old
school
contracts
it
will
be
noted
that
in
a
majority
of
cases
the
teacher
is
specified
as
a
without
doubt
the
chief
requisite
of
a
satisfactory
teacher
in
colonial
days
was
that
he
should
be
a
good
teacher
of
penmanship
we
have
seen
in
our
own
day
distinct
changes
in
the
handwriting
of
an
entire
generation
the
colonists
whose
lives
ended
with
the
seventeenth
century
had
a
characteristic
handwriting
which
retained
certain
elements
of
old
english
even
of
mediæval
script
it
was
a
handsome
and
dignified
chirography
and
an
impressive
one
and
was
usually
easy
to
read

writing

first
pilgrim
and
puritan
fathers

john

was
not
much
better
than

greeley
bradford
we
are
familiar
with
through
the
beautiful
facsimiles
of
his
the
first
half
of
the
succeeding
century
did
not
send
forth
such
good
writers
nor
did
it
send
forth
writers
so
universally
the
proportion
of
signatures
to
public
documents
by
cross
instead
of
writing
increased
our
grandparents
and
all
wrote
well
in
hundreds
of
letters
which
i
have
examined
an
letter
is
an
exception
children
at
the
close
of
the
eighteenth
century
wrote
beautifully
rounded
clear
and
uniform
hands
if
we
can
judge
from
their
little
anna

winslow
writing
in
showed
page
after
page
in
a
hand
far
better
than
that
of
most
girls
of
her
age
claude
blanchard
was
commissary
of
supplies
for
the
french
army
which
landed
in
newport
in
he
visited
the
newport
school
and
gave
this
tribute
to
the
scholars
i
saw
the
writing
of
these
children
it
appeared
to
me
to
be
handsome
among
others
that
of
a
young
girl
nine
or
ten
years
old
very
pretty
and
very
modest
and
such
as
i
would
like
my
own
daughter
to
be
when
she
is
so
old
she
was
called
abigail
earle
as
i
perceived
upon
her
on
which
her
name
was
written
i
wrote
it
myself
adding
to
it
pretty

exhibition

is
here
given
of
the
penmanship
of
anne

was
looked
upon
by
the
best

as
the
greatest
master
of
the
pen
we
ever
had
among
us
of
which
he
has
left
a
beautiful
demonstration
this
beautiful
demonstration
of
his
penmanship
was
a
most
intricate
piece
of
what
was
known
as
fine
knotting
or
knotwork
it
was
said
to
be
written
in
all
the
known
hands
of
great
britain
and
was
valued
at
it
was
bequeathed
to
harvard
college

it
was
bought
by
the
revolutionary
patriot
john
hancock
who
had
been
one
of

pupils
and
as
we
know

the
fine
bold

years
as
he
had
in
the

two
hundred

twenty

at
one

in

his
spare
time
must
have
been
very
short
he
and
other
of
the

family
left
behind
a
still
nobler
demonstration
than
this
knotwork
in
the
handwriting
of
their

qualities
of

was
that
he

of

certainly
the
most
imaginative
mind
must
be
touched
with
a
sense
of
nearness
to
the
heart

yellowed

for
the

still
clear

the
paper
firm

good
the
letters
and
the
text
breathes
a
spirit
of
kindness
affection
and
loving
thoughtfulness
that
speaks
of
the
beauty
of
puritan
home

some
of
the
letters
are
written
by
puritan
women
and
these
letters
are
uniformly
well
spelt
well
written
and
intelligent
perhaps
only
intelligent
women
were
taught
to
write
these
letters

on

there
was

you
would
give
me
some

me
how

my

some
very
intelligent
advice
of
which
these
lines
are
a
portion
in
letter
writing
as
in
conversation
it
will
be
found
that
those
who
substitute
the
design
of
distinguishing
themselves
for
that
of
giving
pleasure
to
those
whom
they
address
must
ever
fail
having
decided
upon
what
is
proper
to
be
said
accustom
yourself
to
express
it
in
the
best
possible
manner
always
use
the
words
that
most
exactly
correspond
with
the
ideas
you
mean
to
express
there
are
fewer
synonymous
words
in
our
language
than
is
generally
supposed
as
you
will
find
in
looking
over
your
dictionary
it
has
been
remembered
upon
as
a
great
excellence
of
washington
writings
that
no
one
could
substitute
a
single
word
which
could
so
well
express
his
meaning
i
have
heard
whether
it
be
true
or
not
i
can
not
say
that
for
seven
years
of
his
life
he
never
wrote
without
having
his
dictionary
before
him
the
letters
of
aaron
burr
written
at
a
little
later
period
to
his
beloved
daughter
theodosia
show
as
unvarying
and
incessant
pains
to
form
perfection
in
as
was
displayed
by
lord
chesterfield
in
his
letters
to
his
son
when
she
was
but
ten
or
twelve
we
find
burr
giving
her
minute
instruction
as
to
her
penmanship
its
size
shape
the
formation
of
sentences
the
spelling
the
exact
use
of
synonyms
he
sends
her
sentences
bidding
her
return
them
in
a
more
elegant
form
to
translate
them
into
latin
he
exhorts
her
to
study
the
meaning
use
and
etymology
of
every
word
in
his
letter
he
has
her
keep
for
him
a
daily
journal
written
in
a
narrative
style
even
when
on
trial
for
treason
in
he
still
instructed
her
reproving
her
for
her
negligent
failure
to
acknowledge
letters
received
he
commended
her
style
saying
she
had
energy
and
aptitude
of
expression
altogether
i
can
fancy
no
rule
of
correct
epistolary
conduct
left
unsaid
by
burr
to
his
daughter
that
he
had
a
high
opinion
of
her
powers
we
can
not
doubt
but
the
specimens
of
her
composition
that
exist
show
no
great
brilliancy
or
originality
as
books
multiplied
after
the
revolution
many
letters
were
modelled
on
effusions
that
had
been
seen
and
admired
in
print
this
at
a
loss
of
much
naturalness
and
quaintness
of
expression

formed
the
most
pernicious

people
too

a
very
reprehensible
habit
of

their
books

course
each
owner
wrote
his
name
with

also

might

the
head

to

to

is
frequently

lines

are
many

of
indifference

grown
folk
had
in
colonial
days
a
habit
of
keeping
diaries
and
making
notes
in
interleaved
almanacs
but
they
are
not
of
great
value
to
the
historian
for
they
are
not
what
wordsworth
declared
such
compositions
should
be
namely
abundant
in
observation
and
sparing
of
reflection
they
are
instead
barren
of
accounts
of
happenings
and
descriptions
of
surroundings
and
are
chiefly
devoted
to
weather
reports
and
moral
and
religious
reflections
both
original
and
in
the
form
of
sermon
and
lecture
notes
the
habit
of
puritan
women
was
held
up
by
such
detractors
as
bishop
earle
as
one
of
their
most
contemptible
traits
we
can
simply
deplore
it
as
having
been
such
a
vain
thing
for
it
is
certainly
true
no
matter
how
deeply
religious
in
feeling
any
one
of
the
present
day
may
be
that
to
the
modern
mind
a
long
course
of
the
pious
sentiments
and
religious
aspirations
of
others
is
desperately
tiresome
reading
such
records
were
not
tiresome
however
to
those
of
puritan
faith
there
were
but
few
diaries
which
were
not
composed
on
those
lines
the
chief
exception
is
that
historical
judge
sewall
diary
which
shows
plainly
also
the
deep
religious
feeling
of
its
author
another
of
more
restricted
interest
but
of
value
is
that
of
parkman
the
westborough
minister
governor
winthrop
has
much
of
the
diary
element
in
it
naturally
the
diaries
of
children
copied
in
quality
and
wording
those
of
their
elders
a
unique
exception
in
these
youthful
records
is
the
journal
of
a
year
or
two
of
the
life
of
a
boston
schoolgirl

to
report
the

was
checked
by
the

she
lived

years
cant
possibly
do
justice
to
nice

had
better
not
attempt

of

we
therefore

a

of

prove
with

force
the
domination
of
the
puritan
temperament

nervous
desire

intent
to
be
good
and
industrious
and
attentive
and
helpful
we
seldom
meet
that
temperament
in

to

puritan
inheritance
john

adams
when
eleven
years

determined
to
write
a
journal
and
he
thus
lucidly
and
sensibly
explains
his
intentions
to
his
mother
honoured
mamma
my
pappa
enjoins
it
upon
me
to
keep
a
journal
or
diary
of
the
events
that
happen
to
me
and
of
objects
i
see
and
of
characters
that
i
converse
with
from
day
to
day
and
altho
i
am
convinced
of
the
utility
importance
necessity
of
this
exercise
yet
i
have
not
patience
perseverance
enough
to
do
it
so
constantly
as
i
ought
my
pappa
who
takes
a
great
deal
of
pains
to
put
me
in
the
right
way
has
also
advised
me
to
preserve
copies
of
all
my
letters
and
has
given
me
a
convenient
blank
book
for
this
end
and
altho
i
shall
have
the
mortification
a
few
years
hence
to
read
a
great
deal
of
my
childish
nonsense
yet
i
shall
have
the
pleasure
and
advantage
of
remarking
the
several
steps
by
which
i
shall
have
advanced
in
taste
judgment
and
knowledge
a
journal
book
a

of
a
lad
of
eleven
years
old
can
not
be
expected
to
contain
much
of
science
litterature
arts
wisdom
or
wit
yet
it
may
serve
to
perpetuate
many
observations
that
i
may
make
may
hereafter
help
me
to
recolect
both
persons
things
that
would
other
ways
escape
my
memory
my
father
has
given
me
hopes
of
a
pencil
pencil
book
in
which
i
can
make
notes
upon
the
spot
to
be
transferred
afterwards
to
my
diary
and
my
letters
this
will
give
me
great
pleasure
both
because
it
will
be
a
sure
means
of
improvement

believe
this

so
carefully
decided
upon
does

the
adams

preserved
a
vast
number
of
family
papers
but
this
was
not
among
them
i
am
sorry
for
i
find
john
quincy
adams
a
very
pleasing
child
when
he
was
about
seven
years
old
his
father
was
away
from
home
as
a
delegate
to
a
congress
in
philadelphia
which
sought
to
secure
unity
of
action
among
the
rebellious
colonies
his
patriotic
mother
taught
her
boy
in
their
retreat
at
braintree
to
repeat
daily
each
morning
with
the
lord
prayer
inspiring
ode
beginning
how
sleep
the
brave
who
sink
to

etc
later
in
life
adams
wrote
to
a
quaker
friend
for
the
space
of
twelve
months
my
mother
with
her
infant
children
dwelt
liable
every
hour
of
the
day
and
of
the
night
to
be
butchered
in
cold
blood
or
taken
and
carried
into
boston
as
hostages
my
mother
lived
in
unintermitted
danger
of
being
consumed
with
them
all
in
a
conflagration
kindled
by
a
torch
in
the
same
hands
which
on
the
seventeenth
of
june
lighted
the
fires
of
charlestown
i
saw
with
my
own
eyes
those
fires
and
heard
britannia
thunders
in
the
battle
of
bunker
hill
and
witnessed
the
tears
of
my
mother
and
mingled
them
with
my
own
the
mother
took
her
boy
by
the
hand
and
mounted
a
height
near
their
home
and
showed
him
the
distant
signs
of
battle
thus
she
fixed
an
impression
of
a
war
for
liberty
on
his
young
memory
two
years
later
to
relieve
her
anxious
and
tedious
waiting
for
intelligence
from
her
husband
the
boy
became
post
rider
for
her
between
braintree
and
boston
which
towns
were
eleven
miles
apart
not
a
light
or
easy
task
for
the
boy
with
the
unsettled
roads
and
unsettled
times
the
spirit
of
patriotism
which
filled
the
mind
of
all
grown
folk
was
everywhere
reflected
in
the
minds
of
the
children
josiah
quincy
was
at
school
in
andover
from
to
and
he
stated
that
he
and
his
schoolmates
had
as
a
principle
as
a
schoolboy
law
that
every
hoop
sled
should
in
some
way
bear
marks
this
was
evidence
of
the
good
political
character
of
the
owner
and
if
the
marks
were
wanting
the
article
was
contraband
was
seized
and
forfeited
without
judge
jury
or
power
of
appeal
besides
journal
keeping
folks
of
that
day
had
a
useful
custom
of
keeping
a
commonplace
book
that
is
they
wrote
out
in
a
memorable
sentences
or
words
which
attracted
their
attention
or
admiration
in
the
various
books
they
read
or
made
abstracts
or
notes
of
the
same
cotton
mather
tells
of
such
note
making
by
young
students
this
writing
out
of
aphorisms
statements
not
only
fixed
them
in
the
memory
but
kept
them
where
the
memory
if
faulty
could
easily
be
assisted
it
also
served
as
practice
in
penmanship
a
verb
to
commonplace
came
from
this
use
of
the
word
the
biography
of
francis
north
baron
guildford
gave
an
account
which
explains
fully
commonplacing
it
was
his
lordship
constant
practice
to
commonplace
as
he
read
he
had
no
bad
memory
but
was
diffident
and
would
not
trust
it
he
acquired
a
very
small
but
legible
hand
for
where
contracting
is
the
main
business
of
law
it
is
not
well
to
write
as
the
fashion
now
is
in
uncial
or
letters
to
look
like
a
pig
ribs
his
writing
on
his
commonplaces
was
not
by
way
of
index
but
epitome
because
he
used
to
say
the
looking
over
a
commonplace
book
on
any
occasion
gave
him
a
sort
of
survey
of
what
he
had
read
about
matters
not
then
inquisited
which
refreshed
them
somewhat
in
his
memory

keeping

angel
and
of
rare
mental
endowment
his
father
account
of
his
acquirements
runs
thus
he
had
learned
all
his
catechism
at
two
years
and
a
half
old
he
could
perfectly
read
any
of
the
english
latin
french
or
gothic
letters
pronouncing
the
first
three
languages
exactly
he
had
before
the
fifth
year
or
in
that
year
not
only
skill
to
read
most
written
hands
but
to
decline
all
the
nouns
conjugate
the
verbs
regular
and
most
of
the
irregular
learned
out
puerelis
got
by
heart
almost
the
entire
vocabulary
of
latin
and
french
primitives
and
words
could
make
congruous
syntax
turn
english
into
latin
and
vice
versa
construe
and
prove
what
he
read
and
did
the
government
and
use
of
relatives
verbs
substantives
ellipses
and
many
figures
and
tropes
and
made
a
considerable
progress
in
comenius
janua
begun
himself
to
write
legibly
and
had
a
strong
passion
for
greek
the
number
of
verses
he
could
recite
was
prodigious
and
what
he
remembered
of
the
parts
of
plays
which
he
would
also
act
and
when
seeing
a
plautus
in
one
hand
he
asked
what
book
it
was
and
being
told
it
was
comedy
and
too
difficult
for
him
he
wept
for
sorrow
strange
was
his
apt
and
ingenious
application
of
fables
and
morals
for
he
had
read
æsop
he
had
a
wonderful
disposition
to
mathematics
having
by
heart
divers
propositions
of
euclid
that
were
read
to
him
in
play
and
he
would
make
lines
and
demonstrate
them
he
had
learned
by
heart
divers
sentences
in
latin
and
greek
which
on
occasion
he
would
produce
even
to
wonder
he
was
all
life
all
prettiness
far
from
morose
sullen
or
childish
in
any
thing
he
said
or
did
of
course
this
is
not
given
as
an
ordinary
education
of
an
child
it
is
an
extraordinary
record
of
a
very
unusual
child
but
it
shows
what
an
intelligent
child
could
be
permitted
to
do
evelyn
was
a
man
of
great
good
sense
not
the
sort
of
man
who
would
force
a
child
indeed
he
averred
that
he
abhorred
precocity
but
in
truth
it
was
a
time
in
england
history
when
such
a
child
could
easily
be
overstimulated
when
public
events
the
course
of
history
was
so
exciting
that
every
child
of
keen
wit
must
have
felt
the
effects
the
crowding
of
young
minds
did
not
end
with
the
seventeenth
century
a
striking
example
of
the
desire
to
press
education
is
found
in
the
letters
of
lord
chesterfield
to
his
son
beginning
in
when
the
boy
was
not
six
years
old
the
language
and
subjects
would
be
deemed
suited
only
to
mature
minds
in
the
father
wrote
this
is
the
last
letter
i
shall
write
to
you
as
a
little
boy
for
you
will
attain
your
ninth
year
so
that
for
the
future
i
shall
treat
you
as
a
youth
you
must
now
commence
a
different
course
of
life
a
different
course
of
studies
no
more
levity
childish
toys
and
playthings
must
be
thrown
aside
and
your
mind
directed
to
serious
objects
what
was
not
unbecoming
to
a
child
would
be
disgraceful
to
a
youth
etc
letter
after
letter
continued
in
this
tone
for
years
was
the
process
carried
on
the
result
was
a
striking
proof
of
the
futility
of
such
methods
the
son
died
when
but
little
past
his
youth
a
failure
in
everything
the
father
had
most
fondly
desired
and
striven
for
the
crowded
brain
ever
stumbled
and
hesitated
when
put
to
any
important
test
it
was
inevitable
that
new
england
parents
with
their
fairly
passionate
intensity
of
zeal
for
the
education
of
their
children
should
in
many
cases
overstimulate
and
force
the
infant
minds
in
their
charge
it
seems
somewhat
anomalous
with
the
almost
universal
distrust
and
hindrance
of
female
education
that
one
of
the
most
precocious
flowers
of
puritanism
should
have
been
a
girl
the
pious
and
ingenious
jane
turell
who
was
born
in
boston
in
before
her
second
year
was
finished
she
could
speak
distinctly
knew
her
letters
and
could
relate
many
stories
out
of
the
scriptures
to
the
satisfaction
and
pleasure
of
the
most
judicious
governor
dudley
and
other
wise
and
polite
new
england
gentlemen
were
among
those
entitled
judicious
who
placed
her
on
a
table
to
show
off
her
acquirements
when
she
was
three
years
old
she
could
recite
the
greater
part
of
the
many
of
the
psalms
many
lines
of
poetry
and
read
distinctly
at
the
age
of
four
she
asked
many
astonishing
questions
about
divine
mysteries
as
her
father
was
president
of
harvard
college
it
may
be
inferred
she
had
an
extended
reading
course
but
in
a
catalogue
of
harvard
college
library
printed
a
year
or
two
later
there
is
not
a
title
in
it
of
any
of
the
works
of
addison
or
any
of
the
poems
of
pope
nothing

the
copley
family
in
many
families
of
extreme
puritanical
thought
the
children
developed
at
an
early
age
a
comprehension
of
religious
matters
which
would
seem
abnormal
but
was
natural
then
a
striking
instance
of
this
youthful
development
as
he
was

highly
sensitive

every
description

jonathan
edwards
a
letter
of
his
written
when
he
was
twelve
years
old
is
certainly
precocious
in
its
depth
though
there
is
a
certain
hint
of
humor
in
it
some
one
had
stated
the
belief
that
the
soul
was
material
and
remained
in
the
body
until
after
the
resurrection
young
edwards
wrote
i
am
informed
you
have
advanced
a
notion
the
soul
is
material
and
keeps
body
till

as
i
am
a
profest
lover
of
novelty
you
must
alow
me
to
be
much
entertained
by
this
discovery
i
know
whether
this
material
soul
keeps
in
ye
coffin
and
if
so
whether
it
might
not
be
convenient
to
build
a

round

whether
it

long
fine
strings
reaching
from

to

and
whether
it
does
not
live
a
very
discontented
life
i
am
afraid
when
ye
coffin
gives
way
ye
earth
will
fall
in
and
crush
it
but
if
it
should
chuse
to

his
paper

bears

his

through
which
they
would

of

latin
school
when
as
young
as

six
years
and
a
half
old

began
to
study
latin

to

good
temper
albeit
he
was

that
each
morning
while
he
shaved
his
little
son
five
years
of

stood
by

had
also
a

before
him

correct

grown

told

angered
at

he
deemed
slowness

one
year

it
is
told
of
timothy
dwight
president
of

college
that
he
learned
the
alphabet
at
a
single
lesson
and
could
read
the
bible
before
he
was
four
years
old
and
taught
it
to
his
comrades
at
the
age
of
six
he
was
sent
to
the
grammar
school
and
importuned
his
father
to
let
him
study
latin
being
denied
he
studied
through
the
latin
grammar
twice
without

times
bore

marriages
of

very
young
lads

which
were
far
from
rare
in

ever
were
permitted
in

nor
were
they
as
common
at
that
date
in

as
during
the
previous
century
for
there
had
been
severe
legislation
against

against

youthful

many
have
known
of
the

weddings
of
english

marriages
by
proxy
for
reasons
of
state
but
few
know
of
these
unions

cases
concerning
divorces

and
other
kindred
matters
it
is
as
the

it
ranges
over
all
classes
from
people
of
wealth
the
manor
owners
and
squires
to

it
tells
of
the

of
little
children
in
their

arms
some
but
two
or
three
years
old
so
young
that
their
baby
tongues
could
not
speak
the
words
of
matrimony
various
arrangements
chiefly
relating
to
lands
and
maintenance
led
to
these
marriages
also
a

held
up
in

arms
of
an
english
clergyman
who
coaxed
him
to
repeat
the
words
of
the
service
before
it
was
finished
the
child
said
he
would
learn
no
more
of
his
lesson

day

answered
you
must

and
the

marriage
to

is
a
historical
example
of
the
unhappy
result
of
such
marriages
the
earl

there
ever
was
any
aged
five
to
the
duke
of
grafton
i
have
given
the
dates
of
these
later
to
show
that
they
were
not
unusual
in
england
long
after
america
was
settled
as
late
as
a
little
english
girl
of
some
wealth
and
but
nine
years
old
was
taken
from
her
boarding
school
by
her
guardian
and
married
to
his
son
very
differently
did
the
upright
new
englander
regard
the
duties
of
guardianship
a
little
girl
named
rebecca
cooper
was
left
an
orphan
in
early
colonial
days
at
salem
massachusetts
she
was
a
verie
good
match
an
inheritrice
and
the
sharp
eyes
of
emanuel
downing
and
his
wife
were
upon
her
to
make
a
motion
of
marriage
for
their
son
both
wrote
to
governor
winthrop
madam
downing
brother
to
gain
his
intercession
in
the
matter
though
the
maid
had
not
been
spoken
to
madam
wrote
the
disposition
of
the
mayde
and
her
education
with
endicott
are
hopefull
her
person
tollerable
the
estate
very
convenient
and
that
is
the
state
of
the
business
governor
endicott
was
the
guardian
and
his
answering
letter
to
winthrop
has
a
manly
and
honorable
ring
which
might
well
have
sounded
in
the
ears
of
all

busniss
concerninge

such
intendment
i
think

been
but
reason
but
to
let

passe

stirre
in
it
for

reasons
i

the
lord

i
have
alwais
resolved
and
so
hath
my
wife
ever
since
the
girl
came
to
vs
to
yielde
her
vp
to
be
disposed
by
yourself
to
any
of
yours
if
ever
the
lord
should
make
her
fitt
and
worthie
now
for
the
other
for
whom
you
writt
i
confesse
i
can
not
freelie
yeald
thereunto
for
the
present
for
these
grounds
ffirst
the
girle
desires
not
to
mary
as
yet
shee
confesseth
which
is
the
truth
hereselfe
to
be
altogether
yett
vnfitt
for
such
a
condition
shee
beinge
a
verie
girl
and
but
yeares
of
age
where
the
man
was
moved
to
her
shee
said
shee
could
not
like
him
you
know
it
would
be
of
ill
reporte
that
a
girl
because
shee
hath
some
estate
should
bee
disposed
of
soe
young
espetialie
not
having
any
parents
to
choose
for
her
ffifthlie
i
have
some
good
hopes
of
the
coming
on
to
the
best
thinges
and
on
the
other
side
i
fear
i
will
say
no
more
other
things
i
shall
tell
you
when
we
meet
if
this
will
not
satisfy
some
let
the
court
take
her
from
mee
and
place
with
any
other
to
dispose
of
her
i
shall
be
content
which
i
heare
was
plotted
to
accomplish
this
end
but
i
will
further
enquire
about
it
and
you
shall
know
if
it
be
true
ffor
i
know
there
are
many
passages
about
this
busniss
which
when
you
heare
of
you
will
not
like
it
is
pleasant
to
record
that
all
this
and
machination
came
to
naught
it
would
not
have
been
strange
if
governor
winthrop
had
deemed
this
girl
old
enough
to
be
married
he
had
been
but
seventeen
years
old
himself
when
he
was
married
but
he
was
so
he
writes
a
man
in
stature
and
understanding
he
evidently
was
of
the
opinion
that
a
child
of
fourteen
or
fifteen
was
of
mature
years
when
his
son
john
was
but
fourteen
the
governor
made
a
will
making
the
boy
the
executor
of
it
these
were
not
abolished
in
america
because
maturity
or
majority
was
established
at
a
greater
age
for
up
to
the
revolution
boys
reached
man
estate
at
sixteen
years
of
age
became
and
served
in
the
militia
early
unions
were
controlled
by
restrictive
laws
such
as
the
one
enacted
in
massachusetts
in
that
no
female
orphan
during
her
minority
should
be
given
in
marriage
by
any
one
except
with
the
approbation
of
the
majority
of
the
selectmen
of
the
town
in
which
she
resided
another
privilege
of
the
girl
orphan
was
that
at
fourteen
she
could
choose
her
own
guardian
thus
were
children
protected
in
the
new
world
and
their
rights
conserved

coote
the
manner
of
oldtime
children
differed
as
much
from
the
carriage
of
children
as
the
severe
and
arbitrary
modes
of
discipline
of
colonial
days
differed
from
the
persuasive
explanations
the
moral
inculcations
and
exhortations
by
which
modern
youth
are
influenced
to
obedience
parents
teachers
and
ministers
chanted
in
solemn
and
unceasing
chorus
foolishness
is
bound
up
in
the
heart
of
a
child
and
they
believed
the
only
cure
for
that
foolishness
was
in
stern
repression
and
sharp
correction
above
all
in
the
rod
they
found
abundant
support
for
this
belief
in
the
bible
their
constant
guide
john
robinson
the
pilgrim
preacher
said
in
his
essay
on
and
their
surely
there
is
in
all
children
though
not
alike
a
stubbernes
and
stoutnes
of
minde
arising
from
naturall
pride
which
must
in
the
first
place
be
broken
and
beaten
down
that
so
the
foundation
of
their
education
being
layd
in
humilitie
and
tractablenes
other
virtues
may
in
their
time
be
built
thereon
it
is
commendable
in
a
horse
that
he
be
stout
and
stomackfull
being
never
left
to
his
own
government
but
always
to
have
his
rider
on
his
back
and
his
bit
in
his
mouth
but
who
would
have
his
child
like
his
horse
in
his
brutishnes
the
chief
field
of
the
breaking
and
beating
down
process
was
in
school
english
schoolmasters
were
proverbial
for
their
severity
and
from
earliest
days
though
monks
with
their
classes
are
never
depicted
with
the
rod
we
find
agnes
paston
in
writing
to
london
for
word
to
be
delivered
to
the
schoolmaster
of
her
son
clement

was

sixteen
years

katherine

broeck
three
years
old
she
herself
had
borne
on
hand
on
her
marriageable
daughter
beating
her
every
week
sometime
twice
a
day
and
her
head
broken
in
two
or
three
places
this
seems
to
have
been
the
usual
custom
of
the
british
matron
in
high
life
lady
jane
grey
when
she
was
fifteen
years
old
never
came
into
the
presence
of
her
father
and
mother
but
she
was
sharply
taunted
cruelly
threatened
yea
punished
sometimes
with
pinches
nips
bobs
and
other
way
elizabeth
lady
falkland
as
long
as
her
mother
lived
always
spoke
to
that
rigid
lady
while
kneeling
before
her
sometimes
for
more
than
an
hour
together
though
she
was
but
an
ill
kneeler
and
worse
riser
poor
elizabeth
she
was
an
only
child
an
inheritrice
but
she
could
truthfully
aver
she
never
was
spoiled
an
early
allusion
to
school
discipline

wynkyn

died

thus
there
is
no
fault
he
doth
but
he
is
punished
sometimes
he
wringeth
him
by
the
ear
sometimes
he
giveth
him
a
strype
on
the
hand
with
the
ferrul
sometimes
beateth
him
sharply
with
the
rod
great
cromwell
was
sent
off
to
school
with
injunctions
to
the
master
dr
beard
to
flog
the
boy
soundly
for
persisting
in
the
wickedness
of
the
assertion
that
he
had
had
a
vision
and
prophecy
of
his
future
greatness
johnson
told
of
the
unmerciful
beating
he
had
by
one
master
hunter
who
was
very
severe
he
said
the
man
never
distinguished
between
ignorance
and
negligence
and
beat
as
hard
for
not
knowing
a
thing
as
for
neglecting
to
know
it
and
as
he
whipped
would
shout
this
i
do
to
save
you
from
the
gallows
still
the
doctor
was
grateful
for
the
beatings
as
he
felt
to
them
he
owed
his
knowledge
of
latin
and
he
approved
of
the
rod
saying
of
some
young
ladies
whose
mother
had
whipped
them
oft
and
heavily
in
variation
of
one
of
shakespeare
lines
i
will
honor
thee
for
this
thy
duty
his
creed
of
correction
was
this
i
would
rather
have
the
rod
to
be
the
general
terror
to
all
to
make
them
learn
than
to
tell
a
child
if
you
do
this
or
thus
you
will
be
more
esteemed
than
your
brothers
and
sisters
the
rod
produces
an
effect
which
terminates
in
itself
a
child
is
afraid
of
being
whipped
and
gets
his
task
and
there
an
end
o
whereas
by
exciting
emulation
and
comparisons
of
superiority
you
lay
the
foundation
of
lasting
mischief
you
make
brothers
and
sisters
hate
each
other
the
illustrations
of
old
dutch
books
that
show
school
furniture
have
the
odd
ferules
of
monkish
days
the
flat
pieces
of
wood
which
were
distinctly
for
striking
the
palm
of
the
scholar
hand
the
derivation
of
the
word
ferule
is
interesting
it
is
from
fennel
the
tough
stalks
of
the
giant
fennel
of
southern
europe
were
used
by
the
roman
schoolmasters
as
an
instrument

in
some
cases
making

scholars

a
cruel
inquisitor
invented
an
instrument
of
torture
which
he
termed
a
flapper
it
was
a
heavy
piece
of
leather
six
inches
in
diameter
with
a
hole
in
the
middle
this
was
fastened
by
an
edge
to
a
pliable
handle
every
stroke
on

raised
a

equally
brutal
was

birch
rods
and
made

culprit
mount
the
back
of
another
scholar
to
receive
his
lashing
he
called
these
whippings
trouncings
the
good
old
english
word
of
the
elizabethan
dramatists
another
brutal
boston
master
struck
his
scholars
on
the
head
with
a
ferule
until
this
was
forbidden
by
the
school
directors
he
then
whipped
the
soles
of
the
scholars
feet
and
roared
out
in
an
ecstasy
of
cruelty
oh
the
caitiffs
it
is
good
for
them
there
was
sometimes
an
aftermath
of
sorrow
when

stern
old
grandfathers
whipped

whispering

many
ingenious
punishments
were
invented
a
specially
insulting
one
was
to
send
the
pupil
out
to
cut
a
small
branch
of
a
tree
a
split
was
made
by
the
teacher
at
the
severed
end
of
the
branch
and
the
culprit
nose
was
placed
in
the

end
then
he
was
forced
to
stand
painfully
pinched
an
object
of
ridicule
a
familiar
punishment
of
the
dame
school
which
lingered
till
our
own
day
was
the
smart
tapping
of
the
child

heavy
thimble

known
as

two
delinquents

gags
to
be
tied
in

mouth
with
strings
somewhat
as

bit

children
were
punished
by
being
seated
on
a
unipod
a
stool
with
but
a
single
leg
upon
which
it
was
most
tiring
to
try
to
balance
they
were
made
to
stand
on
dunce
stools
and
wear
dunce
caps
and
heavy
leather
spectacles
they
were
labelled
with
large
placards
marked

in
her

school
at
the
beginning
of
this
century
was
to
make
a
child
hold
a
heavy
book
such
as
a
dictionary
by
a
single
leaf
of
course
any
restless
motion
would
tear
the
leaf

rewards
of
merit
should
be
also
told

would
divide
a
single
strawberry
in
minute
portions
among
six
or
more
scholars
and
she
had
a
bussee
or
good
child
who
was
to
be
kissed
many
stories
have
been
told
of
special
punishments
invented
by
special
teachers
the
schoolmaster
at
flatbush
was
annoyed
by
the
children
in
his
school
constantly
using
dutch
words
as
he
was
employed
to
teach
them
english
he
gave
every
day
to
the
first
scholar
who
used
a
dutch
word
a
little
metal
token
or
medal
this
scholar
could
promptly
transfer
the
token
to
the
next
child
who
spoke
a
dutch
word
and
so
on
thus
it
went
from
hand
to
hand
through
the
day
but
the
unlucky
scholar
who
had
the
token
in
his
possession
at
the
close
of
school
received
a
sound
whipping
an
amusing
method
of
securing
good
lessons
and
good
behavior
was
employed
by
old
ezekiel
cheever
and
was
thus
told
by
one
of
his
pupils
rev
john
barnard
i
was
a
very
naughty
boy
much
given
to
play
in
so
much
that
master
cheever
openly
declared
barnard
i
know
you
can
do
well
enough
if
you
will
but
you
are
so
full
of
play
you
hinder
your
classmates
from
getting
their
lessons
therefore
if
any
of
them
can
not
perform
their
duty
i
shall
correct
you
for
it
one
day
one
of
my
classmates
did
not
look
at
his
book
and
could
not
say
his
lesson
though
i
called
upon
him
once
and
again
to
mind
his
book
whereupon
our
master
beat
me
the
boy
was
pleased
with
my
being
corrected
and
persisted
in
his
neglect
for
which
i
was
still
beaten
and
that
for
several
days
i
thought
in
justice
i
ought
to
correct
the
boy
and
compel
him
to
a
better
temper
therefore
after
school
was
done
i
went
to
him
and
told
him
i
had
been
beaten
several
times
for
his
neglect
and
since
master
would
not
correct
him
i
would
and
then
drubbed
him
heartily
the
famous
lancasterian
system
that
of
monitorial
schools
discountenanced
the
rod
but
the
forms
of
punishment
were
not
wholly
above
criticism
they
were
the
pillory
familiar
up
to
that
date
in
england
and
america
as
a
public
punishment
of

i
have
found
nothing
to
show
that
dutch
schoolmasters
were
as
severe
as
those
of
the
english
colonies
curtius
the
first
master
of
the
latin
school
in
new
amsterdam
complained
that
his
hands
were
tied
as
some
of
the
parents
of
his
scholars
forbade
him
punishing
their
children
and
that
as
a
result
these
unruly
young
dutchmen
beat
each
other
and
tore
the
clothes
from
each
other
backs
the
contract
between
the
flatbush
church
and
schoolmaster
dated
specifies
that
he
shall
demean
himself
patient

friendly

astonish
children
of

one
of
them
was
to

the

was
a

a
ring

that
one
of
her
maids
spoke
in
the
housekeeper
room
about
a
matter
that
was
not
to
the
credit
of

my
lady
knew
there
was
truth
in
what
the
girl
said
but
it
was
not
her
place
to
speak
of
it
and
she
must
be
taught
to
know
and
keep
her
place
the

she

a
pretty

should
not

too
ready
to
speak
ill
of
those

her

very
sorry

turn
her

she
hath
but
a

sent
for
her
to
my

gave
her
choice
either
to
be
well
whipped
or
to
leave
the

instantly
she
chose
wisely

with

give
abundant
testimony
of
his
tender
affection
for
his
children
in
this
record
of
his
entire
married
life
he
but
twice
refers
to
punishing
his
children
once
his
son
was
whipped
for
telling
a
lie
a
second
time
he
notes
the
punishment

hit
his

him
pretty
smartly

went
in

by
his

he
sought
to
shadow
and
hide
himself
from
me
behind
the
head
of
the
cradle
which
gave
me
the
sorrowful
remembrance
of
adam
carriage
it
was
natural
that
judge
sewall
ever
finding
symbols
of
religious
signification
in
natural
events
should
see
in
his
son
demeanor
a
painful
reminder
of
original
sin
and
we
can
imagine
with
what
sad
sense
of
duty
he
whipped
him
it
is
the
standard
resort
of
ignorant
writers
upon
puritanism
and
especially
upon
puritanic
severity
to
give
the
name
of
cotton
mather
as
a
prime
expositor
of
cruel
discipline
i
have
before
me
a
magazine
illustration
which
represents
him
lean
lank
violent
and
mean
of
aspect
with
clipped
head
raising
a
heavy
bunch
of
rods
over
a
cowering
child
he
was
in
reality
exceedingly
handsome
very
richly
bewigged
with
the
full
distinctly
sensual
countenance
of
the
cottons
not
the
severe
ascetic
features
of
the
mathers
and
he
as
strongly
opposed
punishment
by
the
rod
as
most
of
his
friends
and
neighbors
favored
and
practised
it
his
son
wrote
of
him
the
slavish
way
of
education
carried
on
with
raving
and
kicking
and
scourging
in
schools
as
well
as
in
families
he
looked
upon
as
a
dreadful
judgment
of
god
on
the
world
he
thought
the
practice
abominable
and
expressed
a
mortal
aversion
to
it
the
first
chastisement
which
he
would
inflict
for
any
ordinary
fault
was
to
let
the
child
see
and
hear
him
in
an
astonishment
and
hardly
able
to
believe
that
the
child
would
do
so
base
a
thing
he
would
never
come
to
give
the
child
a
blow
except
in
case
of
obstinacy
or
something
very
criminal
to
be
chased
for
a
while
out
of
his
presence
he
would
make
to
be
looked
upon
as
the
sorest
punishment
in
his
family
there
can
be
found
episodes
of
colonial
history
where
the
disprejudiced
modern
mind
can
perceive
ample
need
of
the
sharp
whippings
so
freely
bestowed

dull

idle
scholars

the
importance
given
to
outward

of

was
a
natural
result
of
the
domination
for
centuries
of
the
laws
of
chivalry
and
rules
of
heraldry
but
they
were
something
more
than
outward
show
emerson
says
the
forms
of
politeness
universally
express
benevolence
in
a
superlative
degree
they
certainly
developed
a
regard
for
others
which
is
evinced
in
its
highest
and
best
type
in
the
character
of
what
we
term
a
gentleman
and
gentlewoman
it
is
impossible
to
overestimate
the
value
these
laws
of
etiquette
these
conventions
of
customs
had
at
a
time
when
neighborhood
life
was
the
whole
outside
world
without
them
life
would
have
proved
unendurable
even
savage
nations
and
tribes
have
felt
in
their
isolated
lives
the
need
of
some
conventions
which
with
them
assume
the
form
of
taboos
superstitious
observances
and
religious
restrictions
the
laws
of
courtesy
had
much
influence
upon
the
development
of
the
character
of
the
colonial
child
domestic
life
lacked
many
of
the
comforts
of
but
save
in
formality
it
did
not
differ
in
essential
elements
from
our
own
home
life
everything
in
the
community
was
made
to
tend
to
the
preservation
of
relations
of
civility
this
is
plainly
shown
by
the
laws
modern
historians
have
been
wont
to
wax
jocose
over
the
accounts
of
for
slander
lying
which
may
be
found
in
colonial
court
records
astonishingly
petty
seem
many
of
the
charges
even
the
calling
of
degrading
nicknames
making
of
wry
faces
jeering
and
were
fined
and
punished
but
all
this
rigidity
tended
to
a
preservation
of
peace
the
child
who
saw
a
man
fined
for
lying
who
beheld
another
set
in
the
stocks
for
calling
his
neighbor
ill
names
or
repeating
scandalous
assertions
grew
up
with
a
definite
knowledge
of
the
wickedness
and
danger
of
lying
and
a
wholesome
regard
for
the
proprieties
of
life
these
sentiments
may
not
have
made
him
a
better
man
but
they
certainly
made
him
a
more
endurable
one
the
child
of
colonial
days
had
but
little
connection
with
little
knowledge
of
the
world
at
large
he
probably
never
had
seen
a
map
of
the
world
and
if
he
had
he
did
understand
it
foreign
news
there
was
none
in
our
present
sense
of
special
english
events
he
might
occasionally
learn
months
after
they
had
happened
but
never
any
details
nor
any
ordinary
happenings
european
information
was
of
the
scantiest
and
rarest
kind
knowledge
of
the
result
of
a
war
or
a
vast
disaster
like
the
lisbon
earthquake
might
come
from
the
other
great
continents
came
nothing
nor
was
his
knowledge
of
his
own
land
extended
there
was
nothing
to
interest
him
in
the
newsletter
even
if
he
read
it
he
cared
nothing
for
the
other
colonies
he
knew
little
of
other
towns
if
he
lived
in
a
seaport
he
doubtless
heard
from
the
sailors
on
the
wharves
tales
of
adventure
and
romantic
interest
and
he
heard
from
his
elders
details
of
trade
both
of
foreign
and
native
ports
the
boy
therefore
grew
up
with
his
life
revolving
in
a
small
circle
the
girl
was
still
smaller
it
had
its
advantages
and
its
serious
disadvantages
it
developed
an
extraordinarily
noble
and
pure
type
of
neighborliness
but
it
did
not
foster
a
general
broad
love
of
humanity
perhaps
those
conditions
developed
types
which
were
fitted
to
receive
and
absorb
gradually
the
more
extended
views
of
life
which
came
through
the
wider
extent
of
vision
which
has
been
brought
to
us
by
newspapers
by
steam
and
by
electricity
at
any
rate
children
were
serenely
content
for
they
were
unconscious

edition
called

which
was
published
in
london
in

and
a
page
of
the
precepts
are
here
reproduced
the
directions
in
these
books
of

are
plainly
copied
from
a
famous
book
entitled
behaviour
or
decency
in
conversation
amongst
a
book
unsurpassed
in
the
seventeenth
century
as
an
epitome
of
contemporary
manners
and
held
in
such
esteem
that
it
ran
through
eleven
editions
in
less
than
forty
years
after
its
first
appearance
not
the
least
remarkable
thing
about
this
volume
was
the
fact
that
the
first
edition
in
english
was
by
an
ingeniose
spark
not
then
eight
years
of
age
one
francis
hawkins
who
rendered
it
from
the
french
of
grave
persons
the
bookseller
begs
the
reader
to
connive
at
the
stile
on
the
plea
that
it
was
wrought
by
an
uncouth
and
rough
file
of
one
in
green
years
green
years
we
can
not
fancy
sober
young
francis
as
ever
green
or
as
anything
but
a
sere
and
prematurely
withered

can
see
him

colored
attire

made

seated
at

and
standish

poor
little
shrunken
legs
hanging
pitifully
down
inditing
on
foolscap
with
precision
and
elegance
his
pompous
precepts
after
all
he
only
translated
these
maxims
hence
perhaps
was
the
reason
that
he
managed
to
live
to
grow
up
for
translating
did
not
tax
his
intellectuals
as
would
have
composition
the
contained
many
rules
and
instructions
worded
from
still
older
books
on
courtesy
such
as
babees
and
boke
of
and
traces
of
those
hackneyed
rules
lingered
even
in
the
etiquette
books
of
isaiah
thomas
long
after
the
and
household
conditions
indicated
by
them
and
sometimes
necessitated
by
them
had
become
as
obsolete
as
the
formal
duties
of
the
squire
sons
the
younkers
of
account
youths
of
good
houses
and
young
gentlemen
henxmen
for
whom
they
had
originally
been
written
let
us
believe
that
the
habits
pointed
out
by
such
rules
were
obsolete
also
i
can
not
think
for
instance
that
the
boy
born
after
our
revolutionary
war
was
in
the
habit
of
casting
poultry
and
meat
bones
under
dining
tables
even
though
he
is
so
seriously
enjoined
not
to
do
so
this
rule
is
a
survivor
from
the
earthen
floors
and
dirty
ways
of
old
england
a
famous
book
of
rules
of
etiquette
entitled
mirror
of
was
printed
in
in
england
and
as
late
as
many
pages
of
it
were
reprinted
in
america
by
thomas
under
the
title
new
academy
of
the
teachings
in
this
book
were
fearfully
and
wonderfully
polite
this
is
the
sort
of
thing
enjoined
upon
children
and
grown
folk
as
correct
phrases
to
be
exchanged
on
the
subject

breaking
bread

oblige

much

you
will
do
me
the
honour

take
my

you
are
too
courteous

persuasive
to
be
refused

therefore
i
shall
trouble
you
sir
pray
excuse
your
bad
entertainment
at
the
present

will
endeavour
to
make
you
amends

sir
it
has
been
very
good
without
any
defect

needs
no
excuse
the
child
who
sought
to
be
mannerly
certainly
must
have
felt
rather
discouraged
at
the
prospect
laid
before
him
these
superfluities
of
politeness
were
equalled
by
the
absurdities
of
restraint
it
would
certainly
have
been
a
study
of
facial
expression

see
the

ciuilitie
and
after
the
of
good
leading
the
child
as
by

in
the
way
of
all
good
manners
the
constant
reading
of
these
books
and
the
persistent
reprinting
of
their
formal
rules
of
behavior
may
have
tended
to
conserve
the
deportment
of
children
which
has
been
so
lamented
by
aged
grumblers
and
lovers
of
the
good
old
times
it
was
certainly
natural
that
children
should
be
affected
by
the
regard
for
etiquette
the
distinctions
of
social
position
which
they
saw
heeded

around
them

in
all

method

naturally
detracted
from
the
interest
which
would
have
been
awakened
by
a
wise
selection
of
parts
suited
to
the
liking
of
children
and
many
portions
doubtless
frightened
young
children
as
we
have
abundant
record
in
the
writings
of
sewall
and
mather
buckingham
stated
in
his
that
he
read
the
bible
through
at
least
a
dozen
times
before
he
was
sixteen
years
old
some
portions
especially
the
apocalypse
or
revelation
of
john
filled
him
with
unspeakable
terror
and
he
called
the
enforced
reading
of
them
a
piece
of
gratuitous
and
unprofitable
cruelty
he
was
careful
however
to
pay
due
tribute
to
the
influence
of
the
bible
upon
his
literary
composition
and
phraseology
the
constant
reading
of
the
beautiful
english
wording
of
the
bible
influenced
not
only
the
style
of
writing
of
that
day
but
controlled
the
everyday
speech
of
the
people
keeping
it
pure
and
simple
illustration
john
hesselius
and
her
children
john
and
caroline
there
was
one
important
reason
for
the
unfailing
desire
of
english
folk
for
the
bible
and
the
employment
of
its
words
and
terms
it
was
not
only
the
sole
book
with
which
most
english
readers
were
familiar
the
book
which
supplied
to
them
sacred
hymns
and
warlike
songs
the
great
voices
of
the
prophets
the
parables
of
the
evangelists
stories
of
peril
and
adventure
logic
legends
history
visions
but
it
was
also
a
new
book
the
family
of
the
seventeenth
century
that
read
the
words
of
the
small
geneva
bibles
in
the
home
circle
or
poorer
folk
who
listened
to
the
outdoor
reading
thereof
heard
a
voice
that
they
had
longed
for
and
waited
for
and
suffered
for
and
that
their
fathers
had
died
for
and
a
treasure
thus
acquired
is
never
lightly
heeded
the
pilgrim
fathers
left
england
for
holland
before
king
james
bible
our
authorized
version
had
been
published
the
puritans
of
the
boston
and
salem
settlements
had
seen
the
importation
of
geneva
bibles
forbidden
in
england
by
laud
in
and
the
reading
prohibited
at
their
meetings
they
revelled
in
it
in
their
new
homes
for
custom
had
not
deadened
their
delight
and
they
were
filled
with
it
it
satisfied
them
they
needed
no
other
literature
though
puritanism
in
its
anxious
and
restricted
religionism
denied
freedom
to
childhood
yet
the
spirit
of
puritanism
was
deeply
observant
and
conservative
of
family
relations
the
meagre
records
of
domestic
life
in
puritan
households
are
full
of
a
pure
affection
if
not
of
grace
or
good
cheer
the
welfare
if
not
the
pleasure
of
their
children
lay
close
to
the
heart
of
the
pilgrims
their
love
was
seldom
expressed
but
their
rigid
sense
of
duty
extended
to
duty
to
be
fulfilled
as
well
as
exacted
governor
bradford
wrote
in
his
now
in
his
lucid
and
beautiful
english
an
account
of
the
motives
of
the
emigration
from
holland
and
in
a
few
sentences
therein
he
gives
one
of
the
most
profound
reasons
of
all
their
intense
yearning
for
the
true
welfare
of
their
children
as
necessitie
was
a
taskmaster
over
them
so
they
were
forced
to
be
such
not
only
to
their
servants
but
in
a
sorte
to
their
dearest
children
the
which
as
it
did
not
a
little
wound
ye
tender
harts
of
many
a
loving
father
and
mother
so
it
produced
likewise
sundrie
sad
and
sorrowful
effects
for
many
of
theier
children
that
were
of
best
dispositions
and
gracious
inclinations
having
lernde
to
bear
the
yoake
in
their
youth
and
willing
to
beare
parte
of
their
parents
burden
were
often
times
so
oppressed
with
their
hevie
labours
that
though
their
minds
were
free
and
willing
yet
their
bodies
bowed
under
ye
weight
of
ye
same
and
became
decrepid
in
their
early
youth
the
vigor
of
nature
being
consumed
in
ye
very
budd
as
it
were
but
that
which
was
more
lamentable
and
of
all
sorrows
most
heavie
to
be
borne
was
that
many
of
their
children
were
drawne
away
by
evill
examples
into
extravagant
and
dangerous
coarses
getting
ye
raines
off
their
necks
and
departing
from
their
parents
this
country
was
settled
at
a
time
when
all
english
people
were
religious
the
puritan
child
was
full
of
religious
thoughts
and
exercises
so
also
was
the
child
of
roman
catholic
parents
or
one
reared
in
the
established
church
the
diarist
evelyn
was
a
stanch
church
of
england
man
no
lover
of
puritan
ways
but
he
could
write
thus
of
his
little
child
as
to
his
piety
astonishing
were
his
applications
of
scripture
upon
occasion
and
his
sense
of
god
he
had
learned
all
his
catechism
early
and
understood
all
the
historical
part
of
the
bible
and
new
testament
to
a
wonder
how
christ
came
to
redeem
mankind
and
how
comprehending
those
messages
himself
his
godfathers
were
discharged
of
his
promises
he
would
of
himself
select
the
most
pathetic
psalms
and
chapters
out
of
job
to
read
to
his
maid
during
his
sickness
telling
her
when
she
pitied
him
that
all
god
children
must
suffer
affliction
he
declaimed
against
the
vanities
of
the
world
before
he
had
seen
any
often
he
would
desire
those
who
came
to
see
him
to
pray
by
him
and
a
year
before
he
fell
sick
to
kneel
and
pray
with
him
alone
in
some
corner
it
was
not
of
a
puritan
dame
that
this
was
written
her
maids
came
into
her
chamber
early
every
morning
and
ordinarily
shee
passed
about
an
howr
with
them
in
praying
and
catechizing
and
instructing
them
to
these
secret
and
private
praiers
the
publick
morning
and
evening
praiers
of
the
church
before
dinner
and
supper
and
another

with
reading

and
singing
psalms

and
constantly

so
strict
was
she
that
if
she
missed
any
from
the
religious
services
she
presently
sent
for
them
and
consecrated
another
howr
of
praier
there
purposely
for

strenuous
insistence

itself

the

for

were
unrivalled
in
their
mingling
of
barbarity
and
christianity
by
any
other
code
of
laws
issued
in
america
no
puritan
dared
go
farther
than
did
the
good
episcopalian
sir
thomas
dale
for
irreverence
to
any
preacher
or
minister
of

word
the
offender
was
to
be
whipped
three
times
and
thrice
to
ask

forgiveness

catechized

there
is
one
name
which
must
appear
constantly
on
the
pages
of
any
history
of
new
england
of
the
half
century
from
to
that
of
cotton
mather
this
reference
is
due
him
not
only
because
he
was
prominent
in
the
history
of
those
years
but
because
he
is
the
preserver
of
that
history
for
us
from
his
multitudinous
pages
full
though
they
be
of
extraordinary
religious
sentiments
strained
metaphors
and
unmistakable
slang
we
also
gain
much
to
show
us
the
life
of
his
day
the
man
himself
was
not
only
a
puritan
of
the
puritans
but
the
personification
of
a
passionate
desire
to
do
good
this
constant
thought
for
others
and
wish
to
benefit
them
frequently
led
him
to
perform
deeds
which
were
certainly
officious
and
unwelcome
though
inspired
by
noble
motives
his
son
samuel
wrote
a
life
of
him
which
has
justly
been
characterized
by
professor
barrett
wendell
as
the
most
colorless
book
in
the
english
language
but
even
from
those
bleached
and
dried
pages
we
learn
of
cotton
mather
love
of
his
children
and
his
earnest
desire
for
their
education
and
salvation
his
son
words
may
be
given
as
evidently
truthful
he
began
betimes
to
entertain
them
with
delightful
stories
especially
scriptural
ones
and
he
would
ever
conclude
with
some
lesson
of
piety
bidding
them
to
learn
that
lesson
from
the
story
thus
every
day
at
the
table
he
used
himself
to
tell
some
entertaining
tale
before
he
rose
and
endeavor
to
make
it
useful
to
the
olive
plants
about
the
table
when
his
children
accidentally
at
any
time
came
in
his
way
it
was
his
custom
to
let
fall
some
sentence
or
other
that
might
be
monitory
or
profitable
to
them
he
betimes
tried
to
engage
his
children
in
exercises
of
piety
and
especially
secret
prayer
he
would
often
call
upon
them
do
you
forget
every
day
to
go
alone
and
pray
as
i
have
directed
you
he
betimes
endeavoured
to
form
in
his
children
a
temper
of
kindness
he
would
put
them
upon
doing
services
and
kindnesses
for
one
another
and
other
children
he
would
applaud
them
when
he
saw
them
delight
in
it
he
would
upbraid
all
aversion
to
it
he
would
caution
them
exquisitely
against
all
revenges
of
injuries
and
would
instruct
them
to
return
good
offices
for
evil
ones
he
would
let
them
discover
he
was
not
satisfied
except
when
they
had
a
sweetness
of
temper
shining
in
them
his
thought
for
the
young
did
not
cease
with
those
of
his
own
family
he
never
failed
to
instil
good
lessons
everywhere
and
a
special
habit
of
his
on
visiting
any
town
was
to
beg
a
holiday
for
the
school
children
asking
them
to
perform
some
religious
task
in
return

charlotte

elizabeth
hesselius
another
puritan
preacher
rev
ezekiel
rogers
was
so
laden
with
the
fruit
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
that
he
stoopt
for
the
very
children
to
pick
off
the
apple
ready
to
drop
into
their
mouths
when
they
came
to
his
study
he
would
examine

they

how
they
spent

good
books
they
read

rare
blessing

that

blessing

the
young
brood
doth
much
afflict
me
even
the
children
of
the
godly
here
and
elsewhere
make
a
woful
proof
these
ministers
lived
at
a
time
when
new
england
puritanism
in
its
extreme
type
was
coming
to
a
close
but
parents
and
households
thus
reared
clung
more
rigidly
and
exactly
to
it
and
instilled
in
it
a
fervent
hope
of
giving
permanency
to
what
seemed
to
their
sad
eyes
in
danger
of
being
wholly
thrust
aside
and
lost
such
religionists
were
both
cotton
mather
and
samuel
sewall
true
christians
they
called
and
deemed
themselves
they
were
very
gentle
with
their
children
but
a
profound
anxiety
for
the
welfare
of
those
young
souls
made
them
most
cruel
in
the
intensity
of
their
teaching
and
warning
especially
displeasing
to
modern
modes
of
thought
are
their
constant
reminders
of
death
when
cotton
mather
little
daughter
was
but
four
years
old
he
made
this
entry
in
his
diary
i
took
my
little
daughter
katy
into
my
study
and
then
i
told
my
child
i
am
to
dye
shortly
and
shee
must
when
i
am
dead
remember
everything
i
now
said
unto
her
i
sett
before
her
the
sinful
condition
of
her
nature
and
i
charged
her
to
pray
in
secret
places
every
day
that
god
for
the
sake
of
jesus
christ
would
give
her
a
new
heart
i
gave
her
to
understand
that
when
i
am
taken
from
her
she
must
look
to
meet
with
more
humbling
afflictions
than
she
does
now
she
has
a
tender
father
to
provide
for
her
the
vanity
of
all
such
painful
instruction
harrowing
to
the
father
and
terrifying
to
the
child
is
shown
in
the
sequel
cotton
mather
did
not
die
till
thirty
years
afterward
and
long
survived
the
tender
little
blossom
that
he
loved
yet
blighted
with
the
chill
and
dread
of
death
the
pages
of
judge
sewall
diary
sadly
prove
his
performance
of
what
he
believed
to
be
his
duty
to
his
children
just
as
the
entries
show
the
bewilderment
and
terror
of
his
children
under
his
teachings
elizabeth
sewall
was
the
most
timid
and
fearful
of
them
all
a
frightened
child
a
retiring
girl
a
vacillating
sweetheart
an
unwilling
bride
she
became
the
mother
of
eight
children
but
always
suffered
from
morbid
introspection
and
overwhelming
fear
of
death
and
the
future
life
until
at
the
age
of
her
father
sadly
wrote
god
has
delivered
her
now
from
all
her
fears
the
process
which
developed
this
unhappy
nature
is
plainly
shown
by
many
entries
in
the
diary
this
was
when
she
was
about
five
years
old
it
falls
to
my
daughter
elizabeth
share
to
read
the
of
isaiah
which
she
doth
with
many
tears
not
being
very
well
and
the
contents
of
the
chapter
and
sympathy
with
her
draw
tears
from
me
also
the
terrible
verses
telling
of
god
judgment
on
the
land
of
fear
of
the
pit
of
the
snare
of
emptiness
and
waste
of
destruction
and
desolation
must
have
sunk
deep
into
the
heart
of
the
sick
child
and
produced
the
condition
shown
by
this
entry
when
she
was
a
few
years
older
when
i
came
in
past
at
night
my
wife
met
me
in
the
entry
and
told
me
betty
had
surprised
them
i
was
surprised
with
the
abruptness
of
the
relation
it
seems
betty
sewall
had
given
some
signs
of
dejection
and
sorrow
but
a
little
while
after
dinner
she
burst
into
an
amazing
cry
which
caus
all
the
family
to
cry
too
her
mother
ask
the
reason
she
gave
none
at
last
said
she
was
afraid
she
should
go
to
hell
her
sins
were
not
pardon
she
was
first
wounded
by
my
reading
a
sermon
of
norton
text
ye
shall
seek
me
and
shall
not
find
me
and
these
words
in
the
sermon
ye
shall
seek
me
and
die
in
your
sins
ran
in
her
mind
and
terrified
her
greatly
and
staying
at
home
she
read
out
of
cotton
mather
why
hath
satan
filled
thy
heart
which
increas
her
fear
her
mother
asked
her
whether
she
pray
she
answered
yes
but
fear
her
prayers
were
not
heard
because
her
sins
were
not
pardoned
poor
little
wounded
betty
her
fear
that
she
should
go
to
hell
because
she
like
spira
was
not
elected
was
answered
by
her
father
who
having
led
her
into
this
sad
state
was
but
to
comfort
her
both
prayed
with
bitter
tears
and
he
says
mournfully
i
hope
god
heard
us
hell
satan
eternal
damnation
everlasting
torments
were
ever
held
up
before
these
puritan
children
we
could
truthfully
paraphrase
wordsworth
beautiful
line
heaven
lies
about
us
in
our
infancy
and
say
of
these
boston
children
hell
lay
about
them
in
their
infancy
the
lists
in
their
books
of
the
proper
names
in
the
bible
had
an
accompanying
list
that
of
names
of
the
devil
a
most
painfully
explicit
account
of
one
of
the
natures
developed
by
these
methods
is
given
by
cotton
mather
in
his
most
offensive
style
in
a
short
religious
biography
of
nathaniel
mather
the
boy
died
when
he
was
nineteen
years
old
but
unhappily
he
kept
a
diary
of
his
religious
sentiments
and
fears
he
fasted
often
and
prayed
constantly
even
in
his
sleep
he
wrote
out
in
detail
his
covenant
with
god
and
i
can
not
doubt
that
he
more
than
lived
up
to
his
promises
as
he
did
to
the
minute
rules
he
laid
out
for
his
various
religious
duties
still
this
young
christian
was
full
of
horrible
conceptions
of
god
unbounded
dread
of
death
and
all
the
horrors
of
a
morbid
soul
a
letter
written
by
an
older
mather
about
when
he
was
twelve
years
old
shows
an
ancestral
tendency
to
religious
fears
though
i
am
thus
well
in
body
yet
i
question
whether
my
soul
doth
prosper
as
my
body
doth
for
i
perceive
yet
to
this
very
day
little
in
grace
and
this
makes
me
question
whether
grace
be
in
my
heart
or
no
i
feel
also
daily
great
unwillingness
to
good
duties
and
the
great
ruling
of
sin
in
my
heart
and
that
god
is
angry
with
me
and
gives
me
no
answers
to
my
prayers
but
many
times
he
even
throws
them
down
as
dust
in
my
face
and
he
does
not
grant
my
continued
request
for
the
blessing
of
the
softening
of
my
hard
and
in
all
this
i
could
yet
take
some
comfort
but
that
it
makes
me
to
wonder
what
god
concerning
me
may
be
for
i
doubt
whether
even
god
is
wont
to
deny
grace
and
mercy
to
his
chosen
though
when
they
seek
unto
him
by
prayer
for
it
and
therefore
seeing
he
doth
thus
deny
it
to
me
i
think
that
the
reason
of
it
is
most
like
to
be
because
i
belong
not
unto
election
of
i
desire
that
you
would
let
me
have
your
prayers
as
i
doubt
not
but
i
have
them
and
rest
your

a
strong
characteristic
of
english
folk
at
the
time
of
the
settlement
of
the
american
colonies
was
superstition
this
showed
not
only
in
scores
of
petty
observances
but
in
serious
beliefs
such
as
those
about
comets
and
it
controlled
medical
practice
and
was
displayed
in
the
religious
significance
attributed
to
trifling
natural
events
it
was
evinced
in
the
dependence
on
dreams
and
the
dread
of
portents
naturally
children
were
imbued
with
the
beliefs
and
fears
of
their
parents
and
multiplied
the
importance
and
the
terror
of
these
notions
it
can
readily
be
seen
that
religious
training
and
thought
such
as
was
shown
in
the
families
of
samuel
sewall
and
cotton
mather
joined
to
hereditary
traits
and
race
superstitions
could
naturally
produce
a
condition
of
mind
and
judgment
which
would
permit
such
an
episode
as
that
known
as
the
salem
witchcraft
nor
is
it
anything
but
natural
to
find
that
those
two
prominent
bostonians
took
such
important
parts
in
the
progress
of
that
tragedy
illustration
charles
spooner
cary
eight
years
old
it
was
my
intent
to
devote
a
chapter
of
this
book
to
the
results
of
the
study
of
the
part
borne
by
children
in
that
sad
tale
of
psychological
phenomena
and
religious
fanaticism
the
study
proved
most
fascinating
and
research
was
faithfully
made
but
a
stronger
desire
was
that
children
might
find
some
pleasure
in
these
pages
in
reading
of
the
child
life
of
their
forbears
such
a
chapter
could
neither
be
profitable
to
the
child
nor
comprehended
by
him
nor
would
it
be
to
the
taste
of
parents
of
the
present
day
it
was
a
sad
tale
but
was
not
peculiar
to
salem
nor
to
new
england
the
salem
and
boston
settlers
came
largely
from
the
english
counties
of
suffolk
and
essex
where
witches
and
and
abounded
and
salem
children
and
parents
had
seen
in
their
english
homes
or
heard
the
tales
of
hundreds

similar
obsessions

possessions

presence
at
funerals
was
universal
a
funeral
in
those

had
an
entirely
different
status
as
a

a
social
function
as
well
as

had
to

on
sundays
because
the
vast
concourse
of

followed

coffin
through

became
a

rabble

profaned

were
not

all
the
religious
restriction

all
the

the

rigidity
of

is
somewhat
a
surprise
to
the
reader

sources

history
to
find
that
girls
sometimes
laughed

behaved
very
badly

its

descriptions
of

and
the
sufferings
of

are
weakened
to
the
modern
mind
by
the
thought
of
the
presumptuous
complacence
of
the
author
who
would
dare
to
give
page
after
page
of
what
he
conceived
the
great
judge
would
say
on
the
day
of
judgment
but
of
course
no
child
certainly
no
child
of
puritan
training
would
note
either
absurdity
or
impropriety
in
assigning
such
words
and
it
is
sad
to
think
what
must
have
been
the
climax
of
horror
with
which
a
sensitive
child
read

to
the
plea
for
salvation
made
by
reprobate
infants

terrible
words
running

you

you

thus

you
sinners

such
a

as
sinners
may
expect
such
you
shall
have
for
i
do
save
none
but
my
own
elect
yet
to
compare
your
sin
with
who
liv
a
longer
time
i
do
confess
yours
is
much
less
though
every
sin
a
crime
a
crime
it

thomas

wrote
a

not

were
so

about

was

three

purpose
for
grown
readers
were
calmly
appropriated
by
children
with
a
promptness
that
would
seem
to
prove
the
truth
of
the
assertion
that
children
are
the
most
unerring
critics
of
a

these
books

in
the

of

their
warm
adoption

stories
they
have
been
loved
by
hundreds
of
thousands
of
children
and
translated

many
other
languages
hundreds
of
other
books
chiefly
for
children
have
been
written

do
not

what
made
thomas
so
ready
to
catch
up
the
reprinting
of
these
children
books
in
advance
of
other
american
printers
perhaps
his
attention
was
led
to
it
by
the
fact
that
his
token
or
specimen
of
his
work
when
he
was
a

was
one

all
the

round
came
to
see
the
burying
and
it
was
late
before
the
corpse
was
interred
after
which
in
the
night
or
rather
about
four
in
the
morning
the
bells
were
heard
to
jingle
in
the
steeple
which
frightened
the
people
prodigiously
who
all
thought
it
was
lady
ducklington
ghost
dancing
among
the
bell
ropes
the
people
flocked
to
will
dobbins
the
clerk
and
wanted
him
to
go
and
see
what
it
was
but
william
said
he
was
sure
it
was
a
ghost
and
that
he
would
not
offer
to
open
the
door
at
length
long
the
rector
hearing
such
an
uproar
in
the
village
went
to
the
clerk
to
know
why
he
did
not
go
into
the
church
and
see
who
was
there
i
go
says
william
why
the
ghost
would
frighten
me
out
of
my
wits

too
cried
and
laying

on
her
husband
said
he
should
not

ghost
you
blockheads
says
long
in
a
pet
did
either
of
you
ever
see
a
ghost
or
know
anybody
that
did
yes
says
the
clerk
my
father
did
once
in
the
shape
of
a
windmill
and
it
walked
all
round
the
church
in
a
white
sheet
with
jack
boots
on
and
had
a
gun
by
its
side
instead
of
a
sword
a
fine
picture
of
a
ghost
truly
says
long
give
me
the
key
of
the
church
you
monkey
for
i
tell
you
there
is
no
such
thing
now
whatever
may
have
been
formerly
then
taking
the
key
he
went
to
the
church
all
the
people
following
him
as
soon
as
he
opened
the
door
what
sort
of
a
ghost
do
you
think
appeared
why
little
twoshoes
who
being
weary
had
fallen
asleep
in
one
of
the
pews
during
the
funeral
service
and
was
shut
in
all
night
she
immediately
asked
long
pardon
for
the
trouble
she
had
given
him
told
him
she
had
been
locked
into
the
church
and
said
she
should
not
have
rung
the
bells
but
that
she
was
very
cold
and
hearing
farmer
boult
man
go
whistling
by
with
his
horses
she
was
in
hopes
he
would
have
went
to
the
clerk
for
the
key
to
let
her
out
it
would
seem
that
even
an
advanced
pedagogist
and
child
culturist
might
forgive
this
delightful
ghost
like
a
windmill
with
and
a
gun
just
as
a
modern
grammarian
must
forgive
the
verb
would
have

will
doubtless
be
a
surprise
to
many
that

this
little
book
opens
with
an
account
of
tommy
and
his
dog
jowler
who
serves
tommy
for
a
horse
when
tommy
has
a
mind
to
ride
he
pulls
a
little
bridle
out
of
his
pocket
whips
it
upon
honest
jowler
and
away
he
gallops
tantwivy
as
he
rides
through
the
town
he
frequently
stops
at
the
doors
to
know
how
the
good
children
do
within
and
if
they
are
good
and
learn
their
books
he
then
leaves
an
apple
an
orange
or
a
at
the
door
and
away
he
gallops
again

in

show
him
the

opposite
the
letter

him

i
am
not

that

this

had
evidently
seen
service
as
a
chairing
in
some
english
book
when
we
think
what
the
congressmen
of
that
day
were
earnest
patriots
and
that
thomas
knew
them
well
it
seems
strange
that
he
could
have

it
may
interest
children
to

a

story
from
one
of
these
little
volumes
to
see
the
sort
of
thing
children
had
to
amuse
them
a
hundred
years
ago
this
is
from
a
book
called
father
gift
or
how
to
be
wise
and
there
were
two
little
boys
and
girls
the
children
of
a
fine
lady
and
gentleman
who
loved
them
dearly
they
were
all
so
good
and
loved
one
another
so
well
that
every
body
who
saw
them
talked
of
them
with
admiration
far
and
near
they
would
part
with
any
thing
to
each
other
loved
the
poor
spoke
kindly
to
servants
did
every
thing
they
were
bid
to
do
were
not
proud
knew
no
strife
but
who
should
learn
their
books
best
and
be
the
prettiest
scholar
the
servants
loved
them
and
would
do
any
thing
they
desired
they
were
not
proud
of
fine
clothes
their
heads
never
ran
on
their
playthings
when
they
should
mind
their
books
they
said
grace
before
they
ate
and
prayer
before
going
to
bed
and
as
soon
as
they
rose
they
were
always
clean
and
neat
would
not
tell
a
fib
for
the
world
and
were
above
doing
any
thing
that
required
one
god
blessed
them
more
and
more
and
their
papa
mama
uncles
aunts
and
cousins
for
their
sakes
they
were
a
happy
family
no
one
idle
all
prettily
employed
the
little
masters
at
their
books
the
little
misses
at
their
needles
at
their
play
hours
they
were
never
noisy
mischievous
or
quarrelsome
no
such
word
was
ever
heard
from
their
mouths
as
why
may
i
have
this
or
that
as
well
as
betty
or
bobby
or
why
should
sally
have
this
or
that
any
more
than
i
but
it
was
always
as
mama
pleases
she
knows
best
with
a
bow
and
a
smile
without
surliness
to
be
seen
on
their
brow
they
grew
up
the
masters
became
fine
scholars
and
fine
gentlemen

in
these
books
is
found
an
entirely
different
code
from
that
inculcated
by
modern
books
or
taught
by
earlier
books
the
first
books
for
children
simply
exhorted
goodness
giving
no
reasons
but
commanding
obedience
and
virtue
the
books
of
the
puritan
epoch
taught
children
to
be
good
for
fear
of
hell
this
succeeding
school
instructed
them
to
be
good
because
it
was
profitable
all
the
advice
is
frankly
politic
much
is
of
mercenary
mould
children
are
instructed
to
do
aright
not
because
they
should
but
because
they
will
benefit
thereby
and
profit
is
given
the
most
worldly
guise

as
riding
in
a
coach
having
a
purse
full
of
gold
wearing
silks

satins

exalted
station

sheriff
of

that

had
a
hundred

fifty
servants
in

attendants
punishment
the
abhorrence
of
parents
and
evil
results
fall
upon
children
not
so
fiercely
for
lying
stealing
treachery
or
cruelty
as
they
do
for
soiling
their
clothes
falling
into
the
water
tumbling
off
walls
breaking
windows
or
china
and
a
score
of
other
actions
which
are
the
result
of
carelessness
clumsiness
or
indifference
rather
than
of
viciousness
these
books
would
educate
had
they
been
forcible
enough
to
be
of
profound
influence
generations
of
trucklers

money
lovers
the

inclination

it
was
the
constant
effort
of
the
artists
authors
and
teachers
of
olden
times
to
imbue
youth
with
the
notion
that
no
harm
could
possibly
come
to
the

unless
early
death
could
be
counted
an
evil
children
were
taught
that

action
was
ever
immediately
and
conspicuously
rewarded
the
pictures
repeated
and
emphasized
the
didactic
teachings
and
morality
industry
and
good
intentions
were
made
to
triumph
over
things
animate
and
inanimate
that
the
old
illustrations
were
a
delight
to
children
can
not
be
doubted
they
were
so
easily
comprehended
the
bad
boys
of
the
story
always
bore
a
miserable
countenance

the

were

of
all

equally
the
misery
and
embarrassment
all
this
is
lacking
in
modern

books

so
truly
represent
real

things
that
the
naughty
boy
is
not
blazoned
at
first
glance
as
a
different
being
from
the
pious
delight
i
am
inclined
to
believe
that
the
grotesqueness
was
more
amusing
and
impressive
to
children
than
modern
realism
that
there
was
a
stronger
association
of
ideas
with
the
emphasis
of
disproportion
the
absurdities
and
anachronisms
of
scenery
and
costume
were
unnoted
by
the
juvenile
reader
because
he
knew
no
better
in
the
children
books
which
i
have
examined
the
colored
illustrations

all
of

andrew
tuer
in
the
preface
to
his
most
interesting
collection
entitled
and
pictures
from

says
that
the
coloring
was
done
by
children
in
their
teens
who
worked
with
great
celerity
each
child
had
a
single
pan
of
a
brush
a
properly
colored
guide
and
a
pile
of
printed
sheets

child
painted
in

was
one
book
which
children
loved

every
little
child
loves

attempts
have
been
made
to
show
that
the
name
and
collection
were
both
american
that
the
former
referred
to
one
mrs
goose
or
vergoose
a
boston

the
name

by
most
folk
to
be
of

american

at

an
oasis
in

there
is
no
pretence
in
this
edition
of

the
book
had
any
american

to
be
a
collection

rhymes

british

was

many
of

ones
to
familiarize
death
to
the
reading
child
fairchild
was
once
deemed
a
most
charming
as
it
was
certainly
a
most
earnest
book
and
it
has
ever
had
popularity
for
within
a
few
years
it
has
been
reprinted
in
a
large
edition
i
wonder
how
many
scenes
and
references
there
are
in
that
book
nor
are
ordinary
the
saddest
or
most
grewsome
scenes
the
little
fairchilds
having
lost
their
little
tempers
and
pommelled
each
other
somewhat
their
father
takes
them
as
a
shocking
to
see
the
body
of
a
man
hung
in
chains
on
a
gibbet
the
horror
of
the
progress
through
the
gloomy
wood
to
this
revolting
sight
the
father
unsparing
comments
the
hideous
account
of
the
rattling
swinging
turning
its
horrible
countenance
while
fairchild
described
and
explained
and
gloated
over
it
and
finally
kneeled
and
prayed
all
this
through
several
pages
no
carefully
reared
child
would
be
permitted
to
read
reason
for
taking
them
to
this
gibbeted
corpse
should
not
be
omitted
from
this
account
it
was
to
show
them
something
which
i
think
they
will
remember
as
long
as
they
live
that
they
may
love
each
other
with
perfect
and
heavenly
love
a
painful
and
ever
present
lesson
found
on
every
page
is
the
sinfulness
of
the
world
the
children
recite
verses
and
quote
bible
texts
to
prove
that
all
mankind
have
bad
hearts
and
lucy
commits
to
memory
a
prayer
a
portion
of
which
runs
thus
my
heart
is
so
exceedingly
wicked
so
vile
so
full
of
sin
that
even
when
i
appear
to
be
tolerably
good
even
then
i
am
sinning
when
i
am
praying
or
reading
the
bible
or
hearing
other
people
read
the
bible
even
then
i
sin
when
i
speak
i
sin
when
i
am
silent
i
sin
and
is
most
insincerely
recommended
by
many
folk
to
children
i
can
not
believe
any
one
who
has
recently
read
the
book
would
ever
expect
a
modern
child
to
care
for
it
it
is
haloed
in
the
memory
of
people
who
read
it
in
their
youth
and
fancy
they
still
like
it
but
wo
take
the
trouble
to
read
it
and
see
that
they
do

ann
taylor

the
debt
of
amusement
which
american
children
owed
to
newbery
was
paid
in
this
century
by
the

to
english
children
of

pleasure
all

by
a

the
century
this
gentleman
stated
that
he
had
written
one
hundred
and
twenty
books
that
were
professedly
juvenile
of
these
and
his
books
for
older
minds
about
seven
million
copies
had
been
sold
and
about
three
hundred
thousand
were
still
sold
annually
they
were
sent
to
england
in
vast
numbers
and
were
reprinted
there
both
with
and
without
the
author
permission
and
when
the
original
books
were
not
pirated
the
name
peter
parley
was
calmly
attached
to
the
compositions
of
english
authors
as
a
vastly
salable
scores
of
american
authors

such
as

these
were

what
forest
lore
the
boys
learned
too
that
more
and
sweeter
sap
came
from
a
maple
which
stood
alone
than
from
any
in
a
grove
that
the
shallow
gouge
flowed
more
freely
but
the
deep
gouge
was
richest
in
sweet
and
that
many
other
forest
trees
besides
the
maple
ran
a
sweet
sap
i
believe
that
in
earliest
colonial
days
boys
also
took
part
in
a
joyful
outing
a
public
custom
known
as
perambulating
or
beating
the
bounds
the
memory
of
boundaries
and
division
lines
of
commons
public
highways
was
kept
fresh
in
the
minds
of
the
inhabitants
by
an
aryan
custom
the
walking
around
them
once
a
year
noting
lines
of
boundary
and
impressing
these
on
the
notice
and
memory
of
young
people
to
induce
english
boys
to
accompany
these
perambulations
it
was
customary
to
distribute
some
little
gratuity
this
was
usually
a
willow
wand
tied
at
the
end
with
a
bunch
of
points
which
were
bits
of
string
about
eight
inches
long
consisting
of
strands
of
cotton
or
woollen
yarn
braided
or
twisted
together
ended
by
a
tag
of
a
bit
of
metal
or
wood
these
points
were
used
to
tie
the
hose
to
the
knees
of
the
breeches
the
waistband
of
the
breeches
to
the
jacket
etc
long
after
points
were
abandoned
as
a
portion
of
dress
the
wands
with
their
little
knot
of
points
were
given
pepys
wrote
in
that
he
heard
that
at
certain
boundaries
the
boys
were
smartly
whipped
to
impress
the
bounds
upon
their
memories

beating
the
bounds
was
a

important
duty
in
the
colonies
where
land
surveys
were
imperfect
land
grants
irregular
and
the
boundaries
of
each
man

at

very

some
of

at

this
was
called
perambulating
the

and
the
surveyors
who
took
charge
were
called
perambulators

to
either
man
or

hunting

colonial

doubtless
found
one
of
their
greatest
amusements
but
these
sports
were
also
hard
work
and
were
engaged
in
for
profit
as
well
as
for
pleasure
the
scattered
sheepfolds
and
grazing
pastures
at
first
had
to
be
zealously
guarded
from
wild
animals
wolves
were
everywhere
the
most
hated
and
most
destructive
beasts
they
were
caught
in

tied

dipped
in

hardened
in
a

and
concealed
the
hooks
and
tied
to
a
strong
chain
if
the
wolf
swallowed
the
hooks
without
any
chain
attached
it
would
kill
him
but
he
might
die
in
the
depths
of

by
the
beautiful
feather
flowers
made
in
many
of
the
south
sea
islands
perhaps
an
old
sea
captain
brought
some
home
to
his
wife
or
sweetheart
as
a
gift
the
sober
colors
of
many
of
our
home
birds
would
not
make
so
brilliant
a
bouquet
as
the
songless
birds
of
the
tropics
especially
the
millions
of
the
various
parrot
tribes
still
an
everyday
new
england
rooster
has
a
wealth
of
splendid
glistening
color
while
blue
jays
woodpeckers
yellow
birds
and
an
occasional
oriole
or
scarlet
tanager
could
furnish
beautiful
feathers
enough
to
waken
the
ire
of
an
audubon
society
painting
on
glass
was
an
amusement
of
more
scope
in
england
it
was
all
the
mode
and
some
very
quaint
specimens
survive
simpering
beauties
flowers
and
fruit
were
the
favorite
subjects
coats
of
arms
too
were
painted
on
glass
and
handsome
they
were
it
is
not
possible
to
state
exactly
the
position
which
the
study
of
armorial
bearings
and
significations
had
for
two
or
three
centuries
it
seemed
to
bear
relatively
the
same
place
that
a
profound
study
of
literature
has
the
pastime
and
delight
of
cultured
people
we
have
been
amused
for
a
few
years
past
at
the
domination
of
color
in
literature
every
book
title
had
a
color
word
as
red
the
red
study
in
red
badge
of
etc
this
idiasm
as
ingleby
would
call
it
has
extended
to
music
and
even
into
scientific
suggestion
and
medicine
but
this
attributing
unusual
qualities
to
colors
is
nothing
new
in
the
cotton
manuscripts
a
series
of
essays
on
music
six
hundred
years
old
the
relation
between
music
and
color
especially
in
coat
armor
is
given
for
instance
was
the
most
malignant
color
in
arms
and
only
third
in
benignity
in
music
all
gentlefolk
were
profoundly
wise
as
to
the
meaning
of
colors
in
coats
of
arms
and
their
influence
on
the
character
and
life
of
the
persons
bearing
the
arms
this
interest
in
the
study
of
heraldry
wavered
in
intensity
but
did
not
die
till
the
days
of
a
new
nation
and
we
find
from
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
to
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
that
young
girls
in
the
families
of
gentlefolk
paid
much
attention
to
the
making
of
coats
of
arms
those
painted
on
glass
were
the
richest
in
color
and
the
most
satisfactory
but
embroidered
ones
were
more
common
the
choicest
materials
were
used
the
drawing
was
carefully
executed
and
the
stitches
minute
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
laws
of
the
herald
were
strictly
regarded
in
the
setting
of
the
stitches
in
the
stitches
were
laid
parallel
across
the
escutcheon
in
perpendicular
in
diagonally
from
right
to
left
and
so
on

here
is
shown
an
unfinished
coat
of

of
the
pitkin
family
which
belonged
to
jerusha
pitkin
who
was
born
in
the
frame
upon
which
the
work
is
stretched
the
manner
in
which
it
is
mounted
the
nails
that
fasten
it
the
way
the
work
is
outlined
are
all
of
interest
the
needle
still
is
thrust
in
the
black
satin
background
where
it
was
left
by
girlish
hands
a
century
and
a
half
ago
colored
silks
gold
bullion
and
thread
to
complete
this
work
have
been
preserved
with
it
the
embroidery
is
on
black
satin
and
is
as
was
the
proper
shape
of
a
hatchment
or
mourning
emblem
and
it
is
possible
that
this
work
was
begun
as
a
funeral
piece
commemorative
of
some
pitkin
ancestor
such
funeral
pieces
were
deemed
a
very
dignified
observance
of
respect
and
mark
of
affection
they
had
as
successors
what
were
definitely
termed
mourning
pieces
bearing
stiff
presentments
of
funeral
urns
monuments
drooping
willows
and
sometimes
a
bowed
and
weeping
figure
after
the
death
of
washington

our
national
loss
and

vast
numbers

of
these
designs

on

large
numbers
and
variety
bore
these
funereal
emblems
and
laudatory
and
sad
mottoes
as
other
revolutionary
heroes
passed
away
similar
designs
appeared
in
more
limited
numbers
and
the
reign
of
embroidered
mourning
pieces
may
be
said
to
begin
at
this
time
washington
so
to
speak
set
the
fashion
familiarized
with
the
hideous
apotheosis
pitcher
or
the
gloomy
washington
tomb
teacups
as
set
on
a
festal
board
special
mourning
embroideries
did
not
seem
oversad
for
decorative
purposes
and
soon
no
properly
ambitious
household
was
without
one
they
were
even
embroidered
when
the
family
circle
was
unbroken
and
an
empty
space
was
left
yawning
like
an
open
grave
for
some
one
to
die
religious
designs
were
also
eagerly
sought
for
the
tree
of
life
was
a
favorite
a
conventional
tree
was
hung
at
wide
intervals
with
apples
bearing
the
names
of
various
virtues
and
estimable
traits
of
humanity
such
as
honor
modesty
silence
patience
etc
the
sparse
harvest
of
these
emblematic
fruits
seemed
to
indicate
a
cynical
belief
in
scant
nobility
of
nature
but
there
was
hope
of
improvement
for
a
angel
assiduously
watered
the
roots
of
the
tree
with
a
realistic
the
devil
never
absent

that
day

literature

loomed
in
blackness
beneath
the
branches
but
sadly
handicapped
from
activity
by
being
forced
to
carry
a
colossal
pitchfork
and
an
absolutely
unsurmountable
tail
of
gigantic
proportions
these
mourning
pieces
were
but
decadent
successors
of
the
significant
heraldic
embroideries
of
earlier
days
we
passed
through
trying
days
in
art
architecture
and
costume
in
the
first
half
of
this
century
and
it
was
not
until
we
revived
the
older
forms
of
embroidery
and
the
ancient
stitches
that
we
rallied
from
the
blight
of
commonplaceness
and
sentimentality
which
seemed
to
spread
over
everything

the
most
universal
and
piece
of

done
by

a
double

of

it

the

reign
in

was
in

it
was
the

there

of

needlework

but
the

makers
revived
and
encouraged
all
household

there
is
no
doubt
that
as
a
rule
the
long
and
narrow
samplers
are
older
than
those
more
nearly
square
these
ancient
samplers
especially
the
few
bearing
dates
of
the
seventeenth
century
are
much
finer

worked

better

execution
than

the

has
such
perfect
stitches
that
both
sides

it
bears
the
names
miles
and
abigail
fleetwood
and
the
date
it
has
been
in
the
possession
of
henry
quincy
and
her
descendants
since
there
is
little
doubt
that
the
miles
fleetwood
of
the
sampler
was
the
brother
or
nephew
of
charles
fleetwood
who
married
anne
ireton
eldest
daughter
of
great
cromwell
a
splendid
piece
of
anne
fleetwood
embroidery
was
recently
exhibited
in
the
kensington
museum
it
was
scarcely
a
sampler
for
it
bore
a
curious
design
in
applique
work
of
a
lozenge
formed
by
four
triangles
each
of
a
different
bit
of
rich
brocade
of
gold
and
silver
figures
on
amber
or
pink
ground
all
worked
together
with
curious
vines
and

miles
fleetwood
clung
to
the
royal
cause
and
thus
fell
into
the
obscurity
hinted
at
in
the
sampler
verses
in
prosperity
friends
will
be
plenty
but
in
adversity
not
one
in
twenty
in
the
older
samplers
little
attention
is
paid
to
the
representation
of
things
in
their
real
colors
a
green
horse
may
balance
a
blue
tree
and
as
flat
tints
were
used
there
were
few
effects
of
light
and
shade
and
no
perspective
distance
is
indicated
by
a
different
color
of
worsted
thus
the
green
horse
will
have
his
off
legs
worked
in
red
this
is
precisely
the
method
used
in
the
bayeux

other
antique
embroideries

their
times

the
age
of
a
little
daughter
might
be
accurately
guessed
by
her
patchwork
the
was
the
work
of
older
folk
it
required
long
arms
larger
hands
greater
strength
knitting
was
taught
to
little
girls
as
soon
as
they
could
hold
the
needles
girls
four
years
of
age
could
knit
stockings
and
mittens
in
country
households
young
damsels
knit
mittens
to
sell
and
coarse
socks
many
fine
and
beautiful
stitches
were
taught
and
a
beautiful
pair
of
long
silk
stockings
of
design
has
initials
knit
on
the
instep
they
were
the
wedding
hose
of
a
bride
of
the
year
and
the
silk
for
them
was
raised
wound
and
spun
by
the
sister
a
girl
of
fourteen
who
also
did
the
exquisite
knitting
was
never
an
industry
in
the
colonies
it
was
an
elegant
accomplishment
pillow
lace
was
made
and
the
stitches
were
taught
in
families
of
wealth
a
guinea
a

was
charged
by

teachers
old
lace
pillows
have
been
preserved
to
this
day
with
strips
of
unfinished
lace
and
hanging
bobbins
to
show
the
kind
of

was

remained
the

during

years
of
this

girls
spent
years
working

there
are
no
more
striking
survivals
of
antiquity
than
the
games
and
pastimes
of
children
we
have
no
historians
of
child
life
to
tell
us
of
these
games
but
we
can
get
side
glimpses
of
that
life
which
reveal
to
us
as
ruskin
says
more
light
than
a
broad
stare
many
of
these
games
were
originally
religious
observances
but
there
are
scores
that
in
their
present
purpose
of
simple
amusement
date
from
mediæval
days
the
chronicler
froissart
in
tells
of
the
sports
of
his
early
life
over
five
centuries
ago
in
that
early
childish
day
i
was
never
tired
to
play
games
that
children
everyone
love
until
twelve
years
are
done
to
dam
up
a
rivulet
with
a
tile

else
to

less
than

heedfully
in

a
delightfully
familiar
ring
he
also
names
many
familiar
games
such
as
playing
ball
ring
prisoner
base
riddles
and
blowing
was
an
ancient
game
even
in
froissart
day
having
been
played
in
old
rome
and
the
orient
since
time
immemorial
it
is
interesting
to
note
the
persistent
survival
of
games
which
are
seldom
learned
from
printed
rules
but
are
simply
told
from
child
to
child
from
year
to
year
on
the
sidewalk
in

of
my
house
is
now
marked
out
with
chalk
the
lines
for
a
game
of
and
a
group
of
children
are
playing
it
precisely
as
i
played
it
in
my
new
england
home
in
my
childhood
and
as
my
grandfathers
and
grandmothers
played
in
their
day
in
a
little
picture
book
called
is
named
and
vaguely
explained
and
a
note
says
this
exercise
was
frequently
practiced
by
the
greeks
and
spartan
women
might
it
not
be
useful
in
the
present
day
to
prevent
children
having
chilblains
now
is
that
stupid
every
one
knows
time
is
not
in
the
winter
when
the
ground
is
rough
and
frozen
or
wet
with
snow
and
when
chilblains
are
rife
it
is
a
game
for
the
hard
solid
earth
or
a
sunny
pavement
the
variants
of
tag
have
descended
to
us
and
are
played
just
as
they
were
played
when
boston
and
new

were

it
was
carried
by

immigrants
who
retained
many
of
their
home
customs
as
well
as
their
language
for
so
long
a
time
and
took

from

some
of
these
rhymes
were
founded
on
certain
lines
of
ballads
but
without
any
printed
words
or
music
we
all
knew
them
well
and
the
music
was
the
same
that
our
mothers
used

our

had
not

it

table
somewhat
like
a

were

ryde
down

this
game
was
perhaps
the
most
popular
of
domestic
pastimes
and
was
akin
to
i
found
nothing
to
indicate
that
the
cruel
sport
known
as
or
ever
prevailed
in
america
in
this
sport
the
cock
was
tied
by
a
short
cord
to
a
stake
and
boys
at
a
distance
of
twenty
yards
took
turns
at
throwing
sticks
at
him
till
he
was
killed
this
sport
was
as
old
as

time
and
universal
among

english
judge
sewall
wrote
of
shrove
tuesday
in
boston
in
that
there
was
great
disorder
in
boston
by
reason
of
another

he
tells
of
a
young
lad
going
through
boston
streets
carrying
a
cock
on
his
back
and
a
bell
in
his
hand
several
friends
followed
him
loosely
blindfolded
and
carrying

under
pretence
of
striking
at
him
managed
to
distribute
their
blows
with
stinging
force

crowd
around

an
old
english
custom
at
a
later
date
the
sport
of
shying
at

cocks
prevailed
the
dumps
which
were
thrown
and
the
crude
little

of
lead
and
pewter
shaped
like
a

were
often
made
and
sold
by
apprentices
as

popular
in
the
southern
colonies
and
new
york
there
are
prohibitions
against
it
in
the
rules
of
william

certainly
it
was
not
encouraged
or
permitted
here
as
in

schools
where
boys
had

the
schoolroom

where
that

could

and
gaming
which
seemed
almost
hereditary

i

not

young

indulged
much
in
in
any
of
the
colonies
william
bradford
then
governor
of
the

at

thus
grimly
records
in

the
day
called
christmas
day
ye
cal
them
out
to
worke
as
was
used
but
ye
moste
of
this
new
company
excused
themselves
and
saide
went
against
their
consciences
to
work
on
day
so
ye
tould
them
that
if
they
made
it
mater
of
conscience
he
would
spare
them
till
they
were
better
informed
so
he
led
away
ye
rest
and
left
them
but
when
they
came
home
at
noon
from
their
work
he
found
them
in
ye
street
at
play
openly
some
pitching
ye
bar
and
some
at
stoolball
and
such
like
sports
so
he
went
to
them
and
took
away
their
implements
and
tould
them
it
was
against
his
conscience
that
they
should
play
and
others
work
the
exact
description
of
this
game
i
do
not
know
johnson
says
it
is
a
play
where
balls
are
driven
from
stool
to
stool
which
may
be
a
good
definition
but
is
a
very
poor
explanation
the
little
pocket
says
vaguely
the
ball
once
struck
with
art
and
care
and
drove
impetuous
through
the
air
swift
round
his
course
the
gamester
flies
or
his
stools
are
taken
by
surprise
at
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
century
a
french
traveller
named
misson
wrote
a
very
vivacious
account
of
his
travels

he
sagely
noted
english
customs

and

and
airily
discoursed

football
is
a
useful
and
charming
exercise
it
is
a
leather
ball
about
as
big
as

this
is
kick
about
from
one
to
tother

him
that
can
get
it
and
that
is
all
the
art
of
it

existed
in

some
indirect
testimony
as

character

a

of
the

game
there
was
that
day
a
great
game
of
to
be
played
there
was
another
town
played
against
as
is
sometimes
common
in
england
but
they
played
with
their
bare
feet
which
i
thought
very
odd
but
it
was
upon
a
broad
sandy
shoar
free
from
stones
which
made
it
the
more
easie
neither
were
they
so
apt
to
trip
up
one
another
heels
and
quarrel
as
i
have
seen
in

english

were
kicking

themselves
complained

and
enjoined
by
pragmatical
magistrates
just
as
they
were

of

each
bore
its

sure
claim
of
card
newman
the
records
of
childish
flower
lore
contained
in
this
chapter
are
those
of
my
own
childhood
but
they
are
equally
the
records
of
the
customs
of
colonial
children
for
these
games
and
rhymes
and
plays
about
flowers
have
been
preserved
from
generation
to
generation
of
new
england
children
the
transmission
of
this
nature
lore
has
been
as
direct
and
unaltered
in
the
new
world
as
in
great
britain
some
of
these
customs
such
as
the
eating
of
hollyhock
cheeses
and
the
blowing
of
dandelion
clocks
came
originally
as
have
other
play
usages
from
england
many
were
varied
in
early
years
by
different
conditions
in
the
new
world
by
local
fitness
and
suggestion
one
chapter
in
newell
book
upon
the
of
american
dwells
upon
the
conservatism
of
children
the
unquestioning
reception
of
play
formulas
which
he
proves
extended
to
the
flower
rhymes
and
lore
which
i
have
recollected
and
herein
set
down
these
inherited
customs
are
far
dearer
to
children
than
modern
inventions
there
is
a
quaintness
of
expression
a
sentiment
of
tradition
that
the
child
feels
without
power
of
formulating

stella
bradley
bellows
if
the
paradise
of
the
orientals
is
a
garden
so
was
a
garden
of
flowers
the
earthly
paradise
for
a
child
the
long
sunny
days
brought
into
life
so
many
delightful
playthings
to
be
made
through
the
exercise
of
that
keen
instinct
of
all
children
destructiveness
each
year
saw
the
fresh
retelling
and
teaching
of
child
to
child
of
happy
flower
customs
almost
intuitively
or
through
the
knowledge
never
learned
at
schools
that
curious
subtle
system
of
transmission
which
everywhere
exists
among
children
who
are
blessed
enough
to
spend
their
summer
days
in
the
woods
or
in
a
garden
the
sober
teachings
of
science
in
later
years
can
never
make
up
the
loss
to
those
who
have
lived
their
youth
in
great
cities
and
have
grown
up
debarred
from
this
inheritance
knowing
not
when
the
summer
comes
with
flower
and
bee
the
dandelion
was
the
earliest
flower
to
stir
the
memories
in
new
england
it
is
the
firstling
of
the
year
in
the
days
of
my
childhood
we
did
not
wait
for
the
buttercup
to
open
to
learn
whether
we
loved
butter
the
soft
dimpled
chin
of
each
child
was
held
up
as
had
been
those
of
other
children
for
past
decades
to
catch
the
yellow
reflection
of
the
first
dandelion
on
the
pinky
throat
the
dandelion
had
other
charms
for
the
child
when
the
blooms
had
grown
through
seeking
the
sun
from
under
the
dense
box
borders
what
pale
green
curls
could
be
made
by
splitting
the
translucent
stems
and
immersing
them
in
water
or
by
placing
them
in
the
mouth
i
taste
still
their
bitterness
what
grace
these
curls
conferred
when
fastened
to
our
round
combs
or
hung
over
our
straight
braids
far
better
than
locks
of
corn
silk
and
what
adorning
necklaces
and
chains
like
indian
wampum
could
be
made
by
stringing
dandelion
beads
formed
by
cutting
the
stems
into
sections
this
is
an
ancient
usage
one
german
name
of
the
flower
is
the
making
of
dandelion
curls
is
also
an
childish
custom
in
germany
when
the
dandelion
had
lost
her
golden
locks
and
had
grown
old
and
gray
the
children
still
plucked
the
downy
heads
the
clocks
or
blowballs
and
holding
aloft
these
airy
seed
vessels
and
fortifying
the
strong
young
lungs
with
a
deep
breath
they
blew
upon
the
head
to
see
whether
my
mother
wants
me
or

the
daisy
the
farmer
whiteweed
was
brought
to
new
england
so
tradition
tells
as
a
garden
flower
now
as
holmes
says
it
whitens
our
fields
to
the
great
disgust
of
our
liberal
shepherds
it
soon
followed
the
dandelion
in
bloom
and
a
fresh
necklace
could
be
strung
from
the
starry
blossoms
a
daisy
chain
just
as
english
children
string
their
true
pink
and
white
daisies
this
daisy
was
also
used
as
a
medium
of
amatory
divination
by
pulling
from
the
floret
the
white
ray

saying
he
loves

now
rivals
the

a
pest
of
new

fields
though
the
spring
violets
were
dearly
loved
we
slaughtered
them
ruthlessly
by
fighting
roosters
with
them
the
projecting
spur
under
the
curved
stem
at
the
base
of
the
flower
was
a
hook
and
when
the
violets
clinched
we
pulled

the
stronger
was

the

of
this
flower
such
as
show
the
universal
sense
of
its
kinship
to
humanity
i
knew
a

who
insisted
for
years
that

spoke
to
her
another
child
who
had
stolen
a
rose
and
hidden
it
under
her
apron
called
out
pettishly

the
rose
in
a
pansy
bed

take
your
old
flower
as
the
pansy
faces
blinked
and
nodded
knowingly
to
her
the
dielytra
or
we
called
it
had
long
gracefully
drooping
racemes
of
bright
flowers
which
when
pulled
apart
and
straightened
out
made
fairy
gondolas
or
which
might
be
twisted
into
a
harp

many
scores
have
i
carefully
dissected
trying
to
preserve
intact
in
skeleton
shape
the
little
frame
of
the
delicate
flower
the
is
a
flower
of
inexplicable
charm
to
children
it
has
something
of
that
mystery
which
in
human
nature
we
term
fascination
little
children
beg
to
pick
it
and
babies
stretch
out
their
tiny
hands
to
it
when
showier
blossoms
are
unheeded
what
puppets
or
dolls
could
be
made
from
the
great
poppies
whose
reflexed
petals
formed
gay
scarlet
petticoats
and
also
from
the
blossoms

double
balsams

their
frills

flounces
the

render

so
delighted
the

wallace

which
he
called

the
little

silken

be
hung
over

on

solemn

was
permitted
to
gather
the
mertensia

on

holy
day

also
to
use
the
cherished

of
a
prosperous
pin

was
discovered
with
maternal
horror

she
had
carefully

tylor
the
author
of
call
our
attention
to
the
fact
that
many
of
the
beloved
plays
of
children
are
only
sportive
imitations
of
the
serious
business
of
life
in
some
cases
the
game
has
outlived
the
serious
practice
of
which
it
is
a
copy
such
as
the
use
of
bows
and
arrows
children
love
to
produce
these
imitations
themselves
with
what
materials
they
can
obtain
not
to
have
them
provided
in
finished
perfection
thus
the
elaborately
doll
house
and
imitation
grocery
store
can
not
keep
the
child
contented
for
days
and
weeks
as
can
the
doll
room
or
shop
counter
furnished
by
the
makeshifts
of
the
garden
the
child
makes
her
cups
and
saucers
and
furniture
herself
she
prepares
her
own
powders
and
distillations
and
is
satisfied
a
harvest
of
acorn
cups
furnished
table
garniture
but
not
a
cherished
one
they
were
too
substantial
we
preferred
more
fragile
more
perishable
wares
were
fashioned
into
tiny
and
would
not
be
thought
to
be
of
great
durability
a
few
years
ago
i
was
present
at
the
opening
of
an
ancient
chest
which
had
not
been
thoroughly
searched
for
many
years
in
a
tiny
box
within
it
was
found
some
cherished
belongings
of
a
little
child
who
had
died
in
the
year
among
them
was
one
of
these
made
of
with
handles
of
bent
pins
though
shrunken
and
withered
the
still
possessed
some
life
color
but
they
soon
fell
into
dust
there
was
something
most
tender
in
the
thought
of
that
loving
mother
who
had
herself
been
dead
over
half
a
century
who
had
thus
preserved
the
childish
work
of
her
beloved
daughter
poppy
pericarps
made
famous
from
which
the
seed
could
be
shaken
as
pepper
dishes
and
cups
too
for
dolls
and
tiny
handles
of
strong
grass
stems
could
be
attached
to
the
cups
for
the
child
larder
hollyhocks
furnished
food
in
their
mucilaginous
cheeses
and
the
insipid
akenes
of
the
sunflower
and
seeds
of
pumpkins
swelled
the
feast
a
daintier
morsel
a
drop
of
honey
the
clear
of
keats
could
be
sucked
from
the
curved
spur
of
the
columbine
and
the
trumpet
of
the
beautiful
coral
honeysuckle
mellifluous
of
the
name
as
well
as
from
the
tubes
of
the
heads
of
clover
we
ate
also
and
grass
roots
and
smarting
peppergrass
the
sorrel
and
oxalis
which
we
called
ladies
sorrel
and
the
curling
tendrils
of
gave
an
acid
zest
to
our
childish
nibblings
and
browsings
the
gnarled
plum
trees
at
the
end
of
the
garden
exuded
beautiful
crystals
of
gum
of
which
we
could
say
proudly
like
cornelia
these
are
my
jewels
translucent
topaz
and
amber
were
never
more
beautiful
and
void
of
settings
these
pellucid
gems
could
be
stuck
directly
on
the
fingers
or
on
the
tip
of
the
ear
and
when
our
vanity
was
sated
with
the
bravery
or
we
could
no
longer
resist
our
appetite
there
still
remained
another
charm
with
childish
opulence
like
cleopatra
we
swallowed
our
jewels
a
mallow
wherever
it
chanced
to
run
shared
with
its
cousin
hollyhock
the
duty
of
providing
cheeses
these
mallow
cheeses
were
also
eaten
by
english
children
in
allusion
to
this
the
poet
clare
wrote
the
sitting
down
when
school
was
upon
the
threshold
of
the
door
picking
from
mallows
sport
to
please
the
crumpled
seed
we
call
a
cheese
these
flower
customs
never
came
to
us
through
reading
all
our

of
making

balls
of
breaking
the

purse
of
playing
lords
and
ladies
with
the
arum
what
we
call
yet
we
never
thought
of
making
any
kindred
attempts
with
these
or
similar
flowers
we
did
gather
eagerly
the
whose
singularity
of
aspect
seems
always
to
attract
the
attention
of
children
and
by
pinching
it
at
the
base
of
the
flower
made
it
squeak
made
jack
preach
but
like
true
republicans
we
never
called
our
jacks
lords
and
ladies
the
only
liking
we
had
for
the
portulaca
was
in
gathering
the
seeds
which
grew
in
little
boxes
with
a
lid
opening
in
a
line
around
the
middle
oh
dear
it
does
seem
like
the
same
thing
to
hear
these
beloved
little
described
as
a
pyxis
or
a
capsule
with
a
circumscissile
dehiscence
from
the
or
orpine
once
tenderly
cherished
as
a
garden
favorite
now
in
many
localities
a
hated
and
persistent
weed
we
made
frogs
or
purses
by
gently
pinching
the
fleshy
leaves
between
thumb
and
forefinger
thus
loosening
the
epidermis
on
the
lower
side
of
the
leaf
and
making
a
bladder
which
when
blown
up
would
burst
with
a
delightful
pop

which
this
plant
is

the
prevalence
of
this
custom
a
rival
in
sound
could
be
made
by
popping
the
foxglove
fingers
english
countrywomen
call
the
foxglove
a
pop
the
could
also
be
blown
up
and
popped
and

we
placed
rose
petals
and
certain
tender
leaves
over
our

spanish
dolls
noisy
boys
found
scores
of
other
ways
to
make
various
resounding
notes
in
the
gardens
a
louder
pop
could
be
made
by
placing
broad
leaves
on
the
extended
thumb
and
forefinger
of
one
hand
and
striking
them
with
the
other
the

out

and
fiddles
of
cornstalks
and

and
squashes
the

chronicler
in
rhyme
of

days
rev
john
pierpont
called
this
sound
evoked
from
the
instrument
the
deeper
tone
that
murmurs
from
the
pumpkin
leaf
trombone
it
is
instead
a
harsh
trumpeting
these
trombones
were
made
in
germany
as
early
as
the
thirteenth
century
an
whistle
could
be
constructed
from
a
willow
branch
and
a
particularly
disagreeable
sound
could
be
evoked
by
every
boy
and
i
must
acknowledge
it
by
every
girl
too
by
placing
broad
leaves
of
grass
preferably
the
pretty
striped
or
gardener
garters
between
the
thumbs
and
blowing
thereon
other
skilful
and
accomplishments
of
the

i
will
simply
name

and
brooches

nuts
and
of

in
which
dried
could
be
smoked
or

cigars
some
child
customs
successfully
defy
the
law
of
the
survival
of
the
useful
and
ignore
the
lesson
of
reason
they
simply
exist
a
marked
example
of
these
of
bootless
toil
is
the
laborious
hoarding
of
each
autumn
with
what
eagerness
and
hard
work
do
boys
gather
these
pretty
nuts
how
they
quarrel
with
one
another
over
the
possession
of
every
one
how
stingily
they
dole
out
a
few
to
the
girls
who
can
not
climb
the
trees
and
are
not
permitted
to
belabor
the
branches
with
clubs
and
stones
for
dislodgment
of
the
treasures
as
do
their
lordly
brothers
how
carefully
the
gathered
store
is
laid
away
for
winter
and
not
one
thing
ever
done
with
one
until
all
feed
a
grand
blaze
in
the
open
fireplace
at
the
time
of
their
gathering
they
are
converted
to
certain
uses
are
made
into
certain
toys
they
are
tied
to
the
ends
of
strings
and
two
boys
holding
the
stringed
chestnuts
play
two
nuts
are
also
tied
together
by
a
yard
of
cord
and
by
a
catching
knack
circled
in
opposite
directions
but
these
games
have
a
very
emphatic
time
and
season
the
weeks
when
the
ripen
the
winter
store
is
always
untouched
from
a
stray
burdock
plant
which
had
escaped
destruction
in
our
kitchen
garden
or
from
a
group
of
these
pestilent
weeds
in
a
neighboring
could
be
gathered
materials
for
many
days
of
pleasure
the
small
tenacious
burs
could
be
easily
wrought
into
interesting
shapes
there
was
a
romance
in
our
neighborhood
about
a
a
young
man
conveyed
a
written
proposal
of
marriage
to
his
sweetheart
reposing
in
one
of
the
spiny
vehicles
like
the
ahkoond
of
swat
i
do
know
why
or
which
or
when
or
what
he
chose
such
an
extraordinary
medium
but
the
was
forever
after
haloed
with
sentiment
we
made
from
burs
more
prosaic
but
admirable
furniture
for
the
dolls
house
tables
chairs
and
cradles
traces
of
the
upholstery
clung
long
and
disfiguringly
to
our
clothing
but
never
deterred
us
from
the
fascinating
occupation
to
throw
these
burs
upon
each
other
clothing
was
held
to
be
the
commission
of
the
unpardonable
sin
in
childish
morals
still
it
was
done
in
holiday
foolery
as
in
shakespeare
day
the
milkweed
one
of
our
few
native
weeds
and
a
determined
settler
on
its
native
soil
furnished
abundant
playthings
the
empty
pods
became
fairy
cradles
and
tiny
pillows
could
be
made
of
the
beautiful
silk
the
milkweed
and
thistle
both
furnish
pretty
silvery
balls
when
treated
with
deft
fingers
and
their
manufacture
is
no
modern
fashion
manasseh
cutler
writing
in
says
i
was
pleased
with
a
number
of
perfectly
white
silken
balls
as
they
appeared
to
be
suspended
by
small
threads
along
the
frame
of
the
they
were
made
by
taking
off
the
calyx
of
the
thistle
at
an
early
stage
of
blooming
ingenious
toys
of
amusing
shapes
could
be
formed
of
the
pith
of
the
milkweed
and
when
weighted
with
a
tack
would
always
fall
tack
downward
as
did
the
grotesque
witches
pressed
flowers
were
devoted
to
special
uses
i
can
not
recall
pressing
any
flower
save
larkspur
the
of
shakespeare
why
this
flower
was
chosen
i
do
not
know
unless
for
the
reason
that
its
colors
were
so
enduring
we
used
to
make
charming
wreaths
of
the
stemless
flowers
by
placing
the
spur
of
one
in
the
centre
of
another
flower
and
thus
forming
a
tiny
circle
a
favorite
arrangement
was
alternating
the
colors
pink
and
blue
these
stiff
little
pressed
wreaths
were
gummed
on
a
sheet
of
paper
to
be
used
at
the
proper
time
as
a
valentine
were
made
for
that
definite
purpose
yet
i
can
not
now
recall
that
when
february
came
i
ever
sent
one
of
these
valentines
or
indeed
had
any
to
send
i
have
found
these
larkspur
wreaths
in
a
pike
arithmetic
used
a
century
ago
and
also
in
old
bibles
sometimes
fastened
in
festoons
on
the
around
the
name
of
a
past
owner
did
holmes
refer
to
one
when
he
wrote
his
graceful
line
light
as
a
loop
of
larkspur
a
similar
wreath
could
be
made
of
the
columbine
spurs
a
friend
tells
me
she
made
scores
in
her
youth
but
we
never
pressed
any
flowers
but
larkspur
many
pretty
wreaths
were
made
of
freshly
gathered
flowers
the
daintiest
were
of
lilac
or
phlox
petals
which
clung
firmly
together
without
being
threaded
and
the
alternation
of
color
in
these
wreaths
one
white
and
two
purple
lilac
petals
or
two
white
phlox
petals
and
two
crimson
could
easily
prove
the
ingenuity
and
originality
of
the
child
who
produced
them
in
default
of
flowers
the
or
was
made
into
a
similar
garland
in
the
beautiful
and
cleanly
needles
of
the
pine
the
children
had
an
unlimited
supply
for
the
manufacture
of
toys
pretty
necklaces
could
be
made
for
personal
adornment
resembling
in
miniature
the
fringed
bark
garments
of
the
south
sea
islanders
and
tiny
brooms
for
houses
a
thickly
growing
cluster
of
needles
was
called
a
lady
when
her
petticoats
were
carefully
trimmed
she
could
be
placed
upright
on
a
sheet
of
paper
and
by
softly
blowing
upon
it
could
be
made
to
dance
a
winter
amusement
was
furnished
by
gathering
and
storing
the
cones
and
hearing
them
snap
open
in
the
house
the
cones
could
also
be
planted
with
and
form
a
cheerful
green
growing
ornament

thereon

thereof
there
wandered
through
the
town
harmless
and
happy
one
of
god
fools
whose
like
is
seen
in
every
country
community
he
found
his
pleasure
in
early
autumn
in
strolling
through
the
country
and
marking
with
his
in
cabalistic
designs
the
surface
of
all
the
unripe
pumpkins
and
squashes
he
was
driven
by
the
farmers
from
this
annoying
trespass
in
the
daytime
but
by
brave
moonshine
could
still
make
his
mysterious
mark
on
the
harvest
of
the
year
the
boys
of
the
town
impressed
by
the
sight
of
a
garden
or
field
of
squashes
thus
curiously
marked
fell
into
a
habit
of
similar
inscription
which
in
them
became
wanton
vandalism
and
had
none
of
the
sense
of
baffled
mystery
which
always
hung
around
and
illumined
poor
elmer
letters
a
favorite
manner
of
using
the
autumn
store
of
pumpkins
was
in
the
manufacture
of
which
were
most
effective
and
hideous
when
lighted
from
within

when
the
peltate
leaves
of
the

spread

the
leaves
of
the

parasols
the
spreading
head
of
what
we
called
snake
grass
could
also
be
tied
into

effective
miniature

there
is
no
sense
of
caste
among
children
when
in
a

garden
all
are
equally
well
dressed
when
bedizened

brocaded
with

watch
them
snap

hence
its

flew
with
the
sole
thought
of
sewing
up
our
lips
devil
we
called
them
to
this
day
i
instinctively
cover
my
mouth
at
their
approach
we
used
to
entrap
in
the
bells
of
monopetalous
flowers
such
as
or
in
the
ample
folds
of
the
hollyhock
and
listen
to
their
indignant
scolding
and
buzzing
and
watch
them
gnaw
and
push
out
to
freedom
i
can
not
recall
ever
being
stung
in
the
process
we
had
the
artistic
diversion
of
these
were
one
of
the
of
pin
stores
whose
curious
lore
and
the
oddly
shaped
and
named
articles
made
for
them
should
be
recorded
ere
they
are
forgotten
a
was
made
of
a
piece
of
glass
on
which
were
stuck
flowers
in
various
designs
over
these
flowers
was
pasted
a
covering
of
paper
in
which
a
movable
flap
could
be
lifted
to
display
on
payment
of
a
pin
the
concealed
treasures
we
used
to
chant
to
entice
a
pin
a
pin
a
this
being
our
rendering
of
the
word
i
recall
as
our
sights
chiefly
the
tiny
larkspur
wreaths
before
named
and
miniature
trees
carefully
manufactured
of
a
noted
glorious
still
in
childish
history
and
tradition
was
made
for
my
by
a
girl
of
fourteen
she
cut
in
twain
tiny
baskets
which
she
pasted
on
glass
and
filled
with
wonderful
artificial
flowers
manufactured
out
of
the
petals
of
real
blossoms
i
well
remember
her
gilding
refined
gold
by
making
a
gorgeous
blue
rose
out
of
the
petals
of
a
i
can
not
recall
playing
much
with
roses
we
fashioned
a
bird
out
of
the
buds
the
old
english
rhyme
describing
the
variation
of
the
sepals
was
unknown
to
us
on
a
summer
day
in
sultry
weather
five
brethren
were
born
together
two
had
beards
and
two
had
none
and
the
other
had
but
half
a
one
still
with
the
rose
is
connected
one
of
my
most
tender
child
memories
somewhat
of
a
gastronomic
cast
yet
suffused
with
an
element
of
grace
the
making
of
these
dainty
fairy
cakes
were
made
of
layers
of
sprinkled
with
powdered
sugar
and
cinnamon
and
then
carefully
enfolded
in
slips
of
white
paper
sometimes
they
were
placed
in
the
garden
over
night
pressed
between
two
flat
stones
as
a
morsel
for
the
epicure
they
were
not
altogether
alluring
although
inoffensive
but
decidedly
preferable
to
pumpkin
or
sunflower
seeds
and
they
were
englamoured
with
sentiment
for
these
were
not
destined
to
be
greedily
eaten
by
the
concocter
but
were
to
be
given
with
much
secrecy
as
a
mark
of
affection
a
true
love
token
to
another
child
or
some
beloved
older
person
and
were
to
be
eaten
also
in
secret
i
recall
to
this
day
the
thrill
of
happiness
which
the
gift
of
one
of
these
little
brought
to
me
in
the
days
of
my
childhood
when
it
was
slipped
into
my
hand
by
a
beautiful
and
gentle
child
who
died
the
following
evening
during
a
of
fright
the
tragedy
of
her
death
the
memory
of
the
startling
glimpses
given
by
the
vivid
lightning
of
agitated
running
to
and
fro
in
the
heavy
rain
and
lowering
darkness
and
the
terrified
summons
of
kindly
neighbors
all
have
fixed
more
firmly
in
my
mind
the
happy
recollection
of
her
last
gift
another
custom
of
my
youth
was
watching
at
dusk
the
opening
of
the
twisted
buds
of
the
garden
primrose
into
wan
yellow
stars
pallid
flowers
by
dew
and
moonlight
fed
which
filled
the
early
evening
with
a
faint
ineffable
fragrance
that
drew
a
host
of
encircling
night
moths
keats
said
they
leaped
from
buds
into
ripe
flowers
a
habit
thus
told
by
margaret
deland
here
in
warm
darkness
of
a
night
in
june
children
came
to
watch
the
primrose
blow
silent
they
stood
hand
clasped
in
hand
in
breathless
hush
around
and
saw
her
shyly
doff
her
soft
green
hood
and
blossom
with
a
silken
burst
of
sound
in
our
home
garden
stood
a
clump
of
tall
primroses
whose
beautiful
flowers
when
opened
were
four
inches
in
diameter
when
riding
one
summer
evening
along
a
seaside
road
on
cape
ann
we
first
saw
one
of
these
queens
of
the
night
in
an
humble
dooryard
in
the
dark
its
seeds
were
gathered
and
given
by
an
unknown
hand
and
a
heart
to
my
mother
to
form
under
her
fair
tendance
the
luminous
evening
glory
of
her
garden
and
on
summer
nights
this
stately
primrose
still
blooms
in
moonlight
and
starlight
though
the
gentle
hand
that
planted
it
is
no
longer
there
yon
rising
moon
that
looks
for
us
again
how
oft
hereafter
will
she
wax
and
wane
how
oft
hereafter
look
for
us
through
this
same
garden
and
for
in
vain
to
every
child
the
sudden
blossoming
and
pale
shining
in
the
gloaming
have
ever
given
the
evening
primrose
a
special
tender
interest
a
faintly
mystic
charm
through
the
chill
of
falling
dew
and
the
dim
light
and
through
a
atmosphere
which
has
always
encircled
the
flower
and
has
been
felt
by
many
of
the
poets
making
them
seldom
sing
the
evening
primrose
as
a
flower
of
happiness
with
the
good
night
of
children

the
flowers

a
good
many
books
have
been
written
about
the
lives
and
customs
of
our
ancestors
of
colonial
times
and
especially
about
the
differences
between
their
lives
and
ours
and
the
primitive
and
picturesque
utensils
which
they
employed
in
their
households
these
have
been
partly
the
outcome
and
partly
the
prompting
agency
of
the
rage
for
antiques
various
writers
have
unearthed
a
large
amount
of
curious
lore
which
is
not
all
of
equal
value
though
almost
every
hint
that
has
come
through
their
pages
goes
to
recreate
the
atmosphere
and
reveal
the
conditions
pertaining
to
the
earliest
pioneers
in
north
america
alice
morse
earle
has
done
a
great
deal
of
good
work
in
this
field
probably
it
is
quite
within
bounds
to
say
that
she
possesses
a
larger
fund
of
vivacious
and
interesting
knowledge
about
the
lives
and
the
works
the
occupations
and
makeshifts
the
industries
and
enjoyments
of
the
puritans
and
the
other
early
colonists
than
any
other
student
in
this
rich
domain
evening
earle
as
many
readers
have
discovered
is
one
of
the
most
painstaking
and
agreeable
of
antiquarians
the
present
book
is
one
of
her
best
and
chronicle
touches
a
most
fascinating
phase
of
american
history
the
story
which
has
been
patiently
gathered
from
many
sources
and
historical
records
is
told
in
a
graphic
and
charming
manner
and
is
pictured
by
nearly
illustrations
certainly
a
contribution
to
our
history
of
very
high
value
