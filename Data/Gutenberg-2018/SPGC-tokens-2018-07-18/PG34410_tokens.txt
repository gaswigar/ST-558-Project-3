chapter
i
the
gift
of
the
search
the
student
and
fiona
lived
in
a
little
gray
house
on
the
shores
of
a
gray
in
the
isle
of
mist
the
student
was
a
thin
man
with
a
stoop
to
his
shoulders
which
old
anne
macdermott
said
came
of
reading
books
but
really
it
was
because
he
had
been
educated
at
a
place
where
this
is
expected
of
you
fiona
when
she
was
doing
nothing
else
used
to
help
anne
to
keep
house
rather
jerkily
in
the
way
a
learned
man
may
be
supposed
to
like
she
was
a
creature
of
fifteen
who
laughed
when
her
father
threatened
her
with
school
on
the
mainland
and
she
had
a
warm
heart
and
a
largish
size
in
shoes
sometimes
they
had
dinner
sometimes
nobody
remembered
in
time
and
they
had
sunset
and
salt
herrings
with
a
bowl
of
glorious
yellow
to
catch
the
sunset
it
was
anne
who
saw
the
old
hawker
crossing
the
field
behind
the
house
and
burst
in
on
the
bookroom
to
inform
the
student
that
he
wanted
buttons
she
was
met
by
a
patient
remonstrance
on
her
ambiguous
use
of
language
for
said
the
student
if
you
mean
that
buttons
are
lacking
to
me
there
may
be
something
to
be
said
for
you
but
if
you
mean
that
i
desire
buttons
then
indeed
i
do
not
desire
buttons
i
desire
whereon
anne
fled
and
went
out
to
meet
the
hawker
the
frail
old
man
bending
under
his
pack
was
crossing
the
meadow
behind
the
house
brushing
his
way
through
the
september
clover
his
white
hair
was
uncovered
save
for
the
huge
umbrella
which
he
carried
alike
in
sun
and
rain
but
youth
still
lingered
in
his
eyes
which
were
bright
as
the
dawn
and
deep
as
the
behind
him
followed
a
little
terrier
black
as
jet
his
inseparable
companion
at
the
door
he
unslung
his
pack
and
leaving
anne
to
select
her
buttons
passed
straight
through
knocked
at
the
bookroom
door
and
went
in
the
student
wheeled
round
in
his
chair
and
began
to
grope
about
have
you
seen
my
spectacles
he
said
i
ca
see
who
you
are
till
i
put
them
on
and
i
ca
put
them
on
till
you
find
them
for
me
for
i
ca
see
to
find
them
myself
unless
i
have
them
on
pardon
this
involved
sentence
the
old
hawker
picked
up
the
missing
spectacles
and
handed
them
over
you
would
remember
me
in
any
case
he
said
i
last
saw
you
years
ago
when
you
were
trying
to
dig
at
verria
there
was
an
old
man
there
do
you
remember
being
beaten
by
armed
and
you
held
them
up
with
an
empty
revolver
and
took
the
old
man
to
your
camp
and
nursed
him
and
you
said
things
to
the
turkish
governor
and
my
excavations
came
to
an
untimely
end
said
the
student
i
always
owed
that
old
man
a
grudge
for
being
beaten
before
my
tent
why
could
he
have
been
beaten
somewhere
else
i
should
like
to
meet
him
again
and
tell
him
precisely
what
i
thought
of
his
conduct
you
have
done
both
now
said
the
hawker
and
it
is
his
turn
impossible
said
the
student
he
was
as
old
years
ago
as
you
are
now
at
my
age
said
the
old
man
one
grows
no
older
no
one
who
walks
the
world
as
i
do
need
ever
grow
any
older
you
can
walk
thirty
miles
on
monday
when
you
are
twenty
years
old
good
if
you
can
do
it
on
monday
you
can
do
it
on
tuesday
and
if
on
tuesday
then
on
wednesday
therefore
by
an
easy
reckoning
you
can
do
it
as
well
at
eighty
years
old
as
at
twenty
thus
you
never
age
there
a
flaw
in
that
somewhere
said
the
student
i
know
the
heap
how
many
grains
of
sand
make
a
heap
how
many
buttons
do
you
want
said
the
hawker
you
saved
my
life
once
you
shall
have
all
the
buttons
you
want
for
nothing
i
thought
you
could
answer
my
question
said
the
student
but
we
are
getting
on
much
too
fast
we
have
really
begun
yet
i
suppose
you
came
here
to
sell
things
anne
seemed
to
know
you
and
she
said
i
wanted
buttons
i
pointed
out
to
her
that
her
statement
was
either
an
untruth
or
a
truism
and
equally
objectionable
in
either
sense
and
now
you
repeat
it
just
as
i
was
beginning
to
consider
you
quite
an
intelligent
person
by
the
way
who
are
you
i
have
a
different
name
in
most
countries
which
i
visit
said
the
old
man
but
by
profession
i
sell
buttons
and
other
things
what
sort
of
things
said
the
student
i
have
dreams
said
the
old
man
dreams
and
the
matter
of
dreams
imaginings
of
the
impossible
come
true
the
wonder
of
the
hills
at
sunrise
the
quest
of
unearthly
treasure
among
the
the
look
in
the
eyes
of
a
child
that
trusts
you
the
student
took
off
his
spectacles
rubbed
his
eyes
hard
and
settled
his
shoulders
i
desire
something
very
much
he
said
if
you
can
do
all
that
you
can
give
me
what
i
desire
the
hawker
frowned
you
are
a
scholar
he
said
and
i
can
do
nothing
for
scholars
you
need
no
ideal
for
you
have
one
you
need
no
dreams
for
your
life
is
one
for
you
the
earth
pours
out
hidden
treasure
and
the
impossible
comes
true
day
by
day
what
you
desire
just
now
is
a
long
definite
inscription
to
settle
a
controverted
point
in
your
favor
and
if
i
could
give
it
you
just
think
how
miserable
you
be
nothing
further
to
argue
about
there
and
several
quite
happy
and
contentious
professors
would
be
reduced
to
such
straits
that
i
do
know
what
crimes
you
might
all
commit
you
might
even
take
to
making
money
if
i
wanted
money
said
the
student
i
should
being
an
intelligent
person
at
once
proceed
to
make
it
then
i
should
have
to
live
in
the
big
house
again
instead
of
letting
it
and
my
precious
time
would
be
spent
in
arguing
with
my
gardener
and
endeavoring
to
conceal
my
ignorance
from
my
chauffeur
as
it
is
we
live
anyhow
and
i
am
happy
happiness
does
score
any
points
in
the
game
said
the
hawker
what
good
do
you
and
your
inscriptions
do
anyway
that
not
my
job
here
said
the
student
that
will
come
on
afterwards
besides
i
do
want
to
do
good
i
am
why
should
i
take
my
neighbor
by
the
throat
and
say
me
do
good
to
you
or
it
shall
be
the
worse
for
you
and
yours
besides
i
ca
do
good
you
ca
dot
the
wilderness
with
prosperous
homesteads
when
half
the
years
the
oats
do
ripen
till
the
year
after
besides
i
do
do
good
i
have
let
the
big
house
to
shooting
tenants
and
excellent
for
their
health
besides
seventeen
other
reasons
which
i
can
enumerate
if
you
are
able
to
bear
them
besides
fiona
is
fond
of
me
yes
said
the
old
man
softly
that
your
real
justification
and
it
a
great
deal
more
than
i
could
give
you
my
hawker
licence
does
cover
the
big
things
how
many
buttons
do
you
want
fiona
came
scrambling
through
the
open
window
and
curled
herself
up
on
the
rug
with
her
head
on
the
student
knee
the
student
stroked
her
hair
tell
me
what
it
all
about
she
said
this
gentleman
he
said
once
interrupted
a
very
important
piece
of
work
which
i
was
doing
and
i
was
just
about
to
tell
him
exactly
what
i
thought
of
him
when
you
interrupted
me
the
old
hawker
had
risen
and
bowed
courteously
to
the
girl
my
dear
young
lady
he
said
i
have
been
searching
my
pack
for
a
present
for
your
father
and
found
nothing
suitable
but
perhaps
i
could
find
something
for
you
fiona
jumped
up
have
you
a
hedgehog
was
her
question
i
do
not
carry
them
with
me
as
a
general
thing
said
the
old
man
no
doubt
one
could
be
got
but
why
a
hedgehog
i
want
one
for
the
urchin
she
said
you
see
it
his
namesake
i
see
said
the
old
man
quite
gravely
and
who
is
the
urchin
the
urchin
said
the
student
is
a
young
rascal
who
is
the
son
of
my
shooting
tenant
he
plunders
my
daughter
of
all
her
possessions
and
she
abets
him
in
every
form
of
villainy
i
do
try
to
stop
him
throwing
stones
at
things
said
the
girl
here
are
hedgehogs
said
the
hawker
is
that
lucky
now
past
the
window
came
five
hedgehogs
in
a
solemn
row
two
big
and
three
little
behind
them
marshalling
the
procession
walked
the
black
terrier
with
an
eye
of
happy
drollery
there
something
wrong
about
those
hedgehogs
said
the
girl
they
do
do
things
like
that
i
do
think
i
want
a
hedgehog
any
more
thank
you
how
did
you
make
them
do
that
is
your
dog
a
conjurer
i
never
harm
anything
said
the
old
man
so
that
many
creatures
will
come
to
me
when
i
call
but
i
have
better
presents
than
that
choose
for
her
my
friend
said
the
student
the
old
man
began
talking
to
himself
in
a
low
voice
youth
she
has
he
said
and
freedom
and
the
joy
of
life
wonder
also
and
dim
imaginings
of
unseen
things
and
of
the
things
which
men
desire
fame
and
power
are
not
worth
giving
and
love
is
not
mine
to
give
i
have
it
i
give
you
the
search
he
said
the
search
for
the
treasure
of
the
isle
of
mist
others
have
searched
for
it
before
and
some
have
found
but
the
treasure
never
grows
less
that
splendid
said
the
girl
and
when
i
find
the
treasure
i
will
buy
my
father
seven
great
books
which
no
one
else
wants
to
read
and
he
will
be
perfectly
happy
but
i
did
not
promise
treasure
said
the
old
man
i
promised
a
search
fiona
face
fell
then
am
i
not
to
find
anything
at
the
end
of
it
she
asked
the
old
man
chuckled
quietly
i
did
not
say
that
either
he
said
there
a
treasure
and
you
shall
search
for
it
and
you
will
find
it
if
you
are
able
many
there
are
who
helped
to
build
it
up
cuchulain
and
the
forgotten
heroes
who
fought
before
cuchulain
ossian
and
the
forgotten
bards
who
sang
before
ossian
columba
and
the
forgotten
saints
who
died
before
columba
each
has
added
something
to
the
pile
it
is
their
treasure
which
you
shall
seek
for
that
is
my
gift
to
you
how
shall
i
know
where
to
begin
asked
the
girl
and
may
i
take
the
urchin
with
me
whether
you
can
take
the
urchin
with
you
or
not
depends
on
his
capacity
to
go
said
the
old
man
and
as
to
beginning
i
think
you
will
find
that
the
search
will
begin
itself
independently
of
you
it
always
does
but
i
can
give
you
something
that
will
help
you
and
he
took
out
of
his
pocket
a
red
copper
bangle
rudely
hammered
out
with
some
rough
implement
which
he
slipped
over
her
wrist
that
was
made
long
ago
he
said
made
by
men
to
whom
metal
was
a
new
toy
men
who
perhaps
were
nearer
to
the
heart
of
things
than
we
are
you
will
stay
and
have
some
dinner
will
you
not
said
the
student
at
least
if
this
is
a
dinner
night
fiona
is
this
a
dinner
night
i
have
my
doubts
said
the
girl
oat
cake
and
honeysuckle
i
expect
and
what
better
said
the
old
man
but
i
fear
i
could
not
dine
with
you
were
it
ortolans
and
tokay
for
i
may
never
eat
beneath
a
roof
the
open
moor
is
my
dining
hall
and
the
stars
serve
me
and
the
long
white
road
is
calling
me
even
now
but
i
think
that
before
the
treasure
is
found
you
will
see
me
again
chapter
ii
the
beginning
of
trouble
man
said
the
student
is
a
weird
creature
he
dimly
remembers
that
he
began
his
evolution
not
as
a
pair
but
as
a
horde
and
to
the
horde
he
still
seeks
forming
huge
crowds
during
his
working
days
and
on
his
holidays
merely
transferring
the
same
crowds
in
their
totality
to
some
other
place
accompanied
by
a
great
deal
of
purposeless
noise
apart
from
his
crowd
he
apparently
feels
chilly
and
without
noise
unhappy
nothing
is
more
striking
to
the
reflective
mind
than
the
abdication
of
civilization
in
the
face
of
meaningless
noises
daddy
said
fiona
i
want
your
advice
on
the
matter
of
treasure
hunting
for
if
two
go
together
they
do
make
a
crowd
and
they
need
make
a
noise
quote
correctly
said
the
student
what
homer
said
was
that
if
you
and
i
went
to
look
for
a
treasure
i
being
a
mere
man
would
find
it
at
once
by
logical
processes
of
induction
and
deduction
while
you
being
a
superior
woman
were
losing
yourself
in
the
quicksands
of
the
intuitive
short
cut
sir
said
the
girl
your
word
is
law
to
me
therefore
deduce
persiflage
said
the
student
is
not
to
be
encouraged
in
young
children
remember
that
if
you
were
to
force
me
to
do
so
i
might
come
with
you
and
then
i
should
see
exactly
how
you
bungled
the
thing
but
that
what
i
want
you
to
do
daddy
said
fiona
i
do
said
the
student
though
treasure
hunting
is
quite
an
ancient
and
respectable
amusement
for
treasure
some
have
descended
the
crater
of
popocatapetl
some
have
dived
at
tobermory
some
have
dug
in
kensington
gardens
alexander
found
a
treasure
at
persepolis
and
essex
lost
another
in
cadiz
harbor
the
treasure
of
the
incas
lies
hid
in
a
peruvian
ravine
known
but
to
two
indians
at
a
time
the
plunder
which
alaric
took
from
rome
is
still
beneath
the
river
which
he
diverted
to
guard
it
no
one
has
ever
found
the
hoard
of
captain
kidd
or
the
gold
carried
in
the
venetian
galleon
which
sailed
with
the
armada
and
went
on
the
rocks
in
this
loch
the
pursuit
of
treasure
is
therefore
no
doubt
for
the
young
a
legitimate
pastime
daddy
said
fiona
did
one
of
the
armada
ships
really
go
ashore
here
yes
my
dear
said
the
student
she
was
a
great
venetian
called
after
the
madonna
of
the
holy
cross
and
she
carried
the
doubloons
contributed
by
the
church
that
not
the
treasure
the
old
man
meant
said
the
girl
it
is
not
said
the
student
we
know
all
about
the
venetian
ship
the
crew
were
mostly
knocked
on
the
head
but
the
captain
brought
the
doubloons
ashore
and
hid
them
he
himself
was
saved
by
my
ancestor
for
the
time
being
to
whom
he
gave
a
map
showing
the
place
in
the
cave
in
which
the
treasure
was
hidden
he
never
came
back
for
it
so
far
everything
proceeded
on
approved
lines
unhappily
my
ancestor
was
a
careless
sort
of
person
and
gambled
the
plan
away
we
never
heard
any
more
of
it
it
is
however
a
family
tradition
that
there
was
nothing
on
the
plan
to
identify
the
cave
and
as
this
coast
and
the
islands
in
the
loch
are
honeycombed
with
caves
it
would
be
of
little
use
if
we
had
it
no
one
knows
whereabouts
the
galleon
went
ashore
on
calm
nights
her
officers
may
be
seen
swimming
round
the
cliffs
keeping
guard
still
over
their
holy
gold
angus
maceachan
saw
one
once
and
tried
to
speak
to
him
but
he
turned
into
a
seal
and
just
looked
at
angus
with
large
patient
eyes
and
angus
boat
was
wrecked
the
week
after
and
did
you
never
search
for
the
gold
daddy
asked
fiona
never
my
dear
he
said
in
the
first
place
it
would
mean
a
minute
examination
of
some
caves
in
the
second
place
half
of
the
caves
are
not
mine
in
the
third
place
it
is
not
the
kind
of
treasure
i
want
in
the
fourth
place
i
have
time
in
the
fifth
place
i
am
morally
certain
it
is
not
there
now
in
the
sixth
place
the
government
would
claim
it
as
and
in
the
seventh
and
last
place
i
never
thought
about
it
till
you
asked
me
i
not
getting
any
further
with
treasure
hunting
daddy
said
fiona
let
go
out
together
and
start
my
dear
said
the
student
it
your
search
not
mine
it
no
use
my
trying
to
come
with
you
and
i
have
a
fancy
that
it
wo
begin
like
that
can
you
tell
me
how
to
begin
then
daddy
she
asked
i
suppose
by
taking
no
notice
of
it
he
said
it
was
to
begin
itself
was
it
and
i
have
an
uncomfortable
suspicion
that
you
hunt
this
kind
of
treasure
by
turning
round
and
going
the
other
way
so
i
think
you
better
run
out
and
find
the
urchin
and
i
get
back
to
my
inscriptions
the
urchin
was
fiona
principal
ally
a
troublesome
ally
owing
to
his
propensity
for
throwing
stones
she
found
him
now
on
the
shore
steadily
bombarding
a
shore
lark
that
would
move
a
little
way
out
of
range
and
then
sit
down
again
affording
a
splendid
target
luckily
the
enthusiasm
of
the
persecutor
in
pursuit
was
well
matched
by
the
inaccuracy
of
his
aim
urchin
she
called
out
if
you
hurt
that
bird
the
little
people
will
take
you
i
thought
i
knocked
that
into
you
all
right
even
if
you
english
and
slow
in
the
uptake
all
right
said
the
urchin
with
a
grin
we
conquered
you
anyway
as
a
matter
of
fact
said
the
girl
it
was
we
who
annexed
you
if
your
people
were
as
bad
shots
as
you
urchin
it
must
have
been
quite
easy
you
ca
hit
a
bird
sitting
ca
i
said
the
urchin
you
watch
another
fling
and
horrors
the
shore
lark
rolled
over
twittering
helplessly
and
miserably
fiona
was
across
the
rocks
like
a
young
goat
and
when
the
urchin
contrite
but
defiant
arrived
she
had
the
wounded
bird
in
her
hands
and
was
holding
it
to
her
breast
feeling
gently
for
its
hurt
it
lay
quite
still
panting
and
watching
her
with
quick
bright
eyes
broken
wing
she
said
i
believe
it
will
mend
urchin
you
are
a
mere
beast
you
better
go
home
i
do
want
ever
to
see
you
again
the
urchin
turned
scarlet
that
just
like
a
girl
he
said
first
you
tell
me
i
ca
hit
the
old
bird
which
is
the
same
thing
as
telling
me
to
hit
it
and
then
when
i
do
hit
it
you
turn
round
on
me
and
call
names
and
all
the
time
you
just
as
bad
as
i
am
and
the
urchin
turned
and
stalked
off
an
heroic
figure
with
the
mien
of
a
marcus
curtius
about
to
save
his
country
by
leaping
into
the
gulf
unhappily
there
was
a
real
gulf
and
the
boy
head
in
air
rolled
neatly
into
it
and
emerged
from
between
two
rocks
dripping
and
no
longer
heroic
rubbing
a
torn
stocking
and
a
scraped
shin
it
was
too
much
for
fiona
gravity
urchin
she
called
come
back
here
and
as
the
unhappy
urchin
stood
in
doubt
hither
and
thither
dividing
the
swift
mind
she
slid
over
the
rocks
and
caught
him
my
fault
she
said
and
sorry
all
the
way
through
now
i
mend
you
first
and
then
we
must
mend
the
bird
and
then
what
we
do
said
the
boy
let
do
something
harmless
for
a
bit
hunt
for
shells
or
shrimps
or
treasure
suggested
fiona
rather
shyly
and
by
the
time
they
had
reached
the
house
and
she
had
repaired
the
urchin
and
disposed
the
wounded
bird
as
comfortably
as
possible
the
boy
had
been
put
in
possession
of
the
essential
facts
of
the
case
was
the
urchin
comment
now
do
you
see
fiona
you
can
have
your
treasure
when
we
find
it
and
i
have
the
spanish
treasure
when
we
find
it
and
there
we
both
are
i
want
lots
and
lots
and
lots
of
those
doubloons
what
for
said
fiona
gun
said
the
urchin
donald
ruadh
has
an
old
gun
which
he
would
sell
me
for
two
pounds
he
says
one
barrel
shoots
all
right
sometimes
and
i
would
use
the
rest
of
the
doubloons
to
buy
cartridges
and
then
i
could
kill
curlews
you
little
wretch
said
the
girl
you
wo
kill
my
curlews
while
i
about
and
anyhow
your
old
gun
would
probably
blow
you
up
first
and
anyhow
you
have
got
the
doubloons
yet
and
they
not
yours
if
you
do
find
them
whose
would
they
be
asked
the
urchin
i
suppose
my
father
said
fiona
but
it
depends
on
which
cave
they
were
in
come
on
then
said
the
boy
i
going
to
ask
him
for
them
the
student
took
the
interruption
i
am
in
the
second
century
he
said
doubloons
have
not
yet
been
coined
as
to
these
doubloons
i
am
quite
sure
they
are
not
there
wherever
may
be
but
if
they
are
there
i
have
no
objection
to
the
urchin
fighting
the
government
for
them
urchin
would
you
like
a
deed
and
to
the
delight
of
the
urchin
the
student
proceeded
to
make
out
a
document
which
called
on
all
men
to
know
that
the
said
student
thereby
assigned
to
the
said
urchin
all
the
estate
right
title
and
interest
if
any
of
the
said
student
in
and
to
a
certain
treasure
of
doubloons
or
other
coins
once
carried
in
the
galleon
called
lady
of
the
holy
were
the
same
a
little
more
or
less
all
good
deeds
get
that
in
somewhere
said
the
student
to
hold
to
the
said
urchin
and
his
heirs
but
i
do
suppose
the
heirs
will
see
much
of
it
to
the
intent
that
he
might
become
a
wiser
and
a
better
urchin
and
not
interrupt
the
said
student
any
more
when
he
wanted
to
work
this
being
done
the
student
signed
his
name
at
the
end
made
a
beautiful
blot
of
hot
red
sealing
wax
and
put
his
signet
ring
on
it
and
made
fiona
sign
her
name
as
witness
which
is
probably
not
legal
he
explained
cheerfully
then
he
handed
over
the
deed
to
the
rejoicing
urchin
with
the
remark
that
it
was
quite
as
good
as
many
lawyers
deeds
and
drove
the
pair
of
them
out
of
the
bookroom
good
said
the
urchin
now
i
a
treasure
just
the
same
as
you
if
we
find
them
said
fiona
well
let
go
and
start
hunting
for
them
at
any
rate
said
the
boy
pardon
me
said
the
shore
lark
if
i
interrupt
but
you
might
be
the
better
of
a
few
hints
fiona
dropped
on
her
knees
and
took
the
little
bird
in
her
hands
again
so
you
can
talk
she
said
that
jolly
you
a
chance
of
returning
good
for
evil
and
making
us
feel
worms
do
talk
of
worms
said
the
shore
lark
you
have
entirely
omitted
to
provide
me
with
any
send
him
to
get
some
and
i
tell
you
something
he
ca
understand
what
i
saying
anyhow
urchin
said
the
girl
he
asking
for
worms
go
and
get
him
some
one
would
think
you
and
he
could
talk
to
each
other
said
the
boy
silly
i
call
it
going
on
like
that
i
suppose
that
what
girls
do
urchin
said
fiona
when
you
and
i
have
a
row
what
happens
happen
said
the
urchin
you
three
years
pull
fair
just
like
a
girl
to
go
and
have
three
years
pull
of
a
chap
stop
grousing
said
the
girl
and
get
me
the
worms
there
a
dear
little
boy
the
urchin
flung
the
nearest
book
at
her
missed
as
usual
and
having
thus
made
his
honor
white
departed
declaring
in
simpler
language
that
the
love
of
worms
was
the
root
of
all
evil
i
ca
tell
you
much
said
the
shore
lark
but
one
sometimes
picks
up
things
hopping
about
and
i
heard
you
say
treasure
if
you
mean
the
venetian
ship
do
start
without
consulting
the
finner
he
is
very
old
and
i
believe
that
he
knows
everything
that
happens
in
this
loch
i
do
really
mean
that
said
fiona
that
half
a
jest
i
mean
my
own
search
the
search
for
the
treasure
of
the
isle
of
mist
we
have
all
heard
of
it
said
the
shore
lark
and
we
all
know
that
you
can
not
find
it
by
looking
for
it
all
i
can
tell
you
is
this
the
curlews
have
a
tradition
that
the
last
man
who
found
it
went
up
a
hill
that
is
what
they
tell
each
other
when
they
call
in
the
spring
and
i
believe
they
know
they
are
like
the
spirits
of
the
hills
themselves
said
fiona
tell
me
why
it
is
i
can
understand
you
i
have
no
idea
said
the
shore
lark
i
am
only
a
little
bird
and
i
do
know
very
much
i
chanced
speaking
to
you
because
i
wanted
worms
the
girl
slipped
across
into
the
bookroom
daddy
she
said
come
back
out
of
the
second
century
and
tell
me
why
i
can
understand
the
shore
lark
the
student
looked
up
with
a
patient
smile
in
eyes
it
is
time
to
come
back
yet
he
said
and
i
have
not
fully
grasped
your
meaning
you
appear
to
refer
to
some
conversation
with
some
bird
there
are
precedents
of
course
for
instance
the
philosopher
empedocles
having
been
a
bird
himself
in
a
former
life
remembered
their
speech
he
ended
by
leaping
into
ætna
siegfried
also
having
bathed
in
the
blood
of
fafnir
followed
the
voice
of
a
bird
of
the
wood
he
ended
by
losing
his
love
and
his
life
there
was
once
a
sailor
who
took
the
advice
of
a
parrot
and
was
hanged
birds
are
as
the
poet
aristophanes
discovered
and
it
would
seem
that
little
good
comes
of
talking
to
them
my
shore
lark
is
a
darling
said
fiona
and
i
do
intend
to
be
hanged
that
said
the
student
is
as
providence
pleases
one
never
knows
as
my
poor
ancestor
said
when
he
fell
into
a
and
found
the
bear
there
before
him
o
daddy
said
the
girl
did
he
really
and
what
happened
this
ancestor
of
mine
said
the
student
was
a
very
strong
man
if
he
had
not
been
someone
else
would
have
killed
him
first
and
he
would
not
have
been
my
ancestor
the
other
man
would
have
been
someone
else
ancestor
so
to
speak
being
a
very
strong
man
he
naturally
killed
the
bear
he
must
have
or
he
would
not
have
lived
to
be
my
ancestor
in
those
days
everyone
lived
in
caves
and
he
lived
in
a
cave
too
and
he
always
killed
the
other
man
sometimes
fairly
sometimes
i
regret
to
say
otherwise
he
courted
my
ancestress
by
knocking
her
down
from
behind
with
the
blunt
end
of
a
stone
ax
a
method
which
i
do
not
defend
but
when
her
senses
returned
she
told
him
he
had
acted
like
a
man
and
they
became
a
most
devoted
couple
this
was
partly
due
no
doubt
to
the
fact
that
he
never
saw
the
meaning
of
the
things
she
said
she
took
good
care
that
he
should
for
though
slow
of
wit
he
was
handy
with
his
ax
their
life
i
think
must
have
been
very
happy
till
one
day
he
found
a
red
stone
which
he
could
heat
and
shape
with
his
ax
and
he
hammered
out
that
copper
bracelet
you
wearing
and
then
came
the
deluge
for
metal
meant
magic
then
as
you
know
next
day
my
ancestress
found
him
conversing
with
the
local
vulture
within
a
week
he
was
giving
exhibitions
in
the
other
caves
with
the
vulture
assistance
in
a
month
he
had
become
the
tribal
god
and
about
two
years
after
owing
to
the
persistent
failure
of
some
of
his
magic
to
come
off
he
was
for
a
brief
moment
the
tribal
banquet
now
you
know
what
comes
of
talking
to
shore
larks
daddy
she
said
you
ca
know
if
that
true
or
not
can
you
it
may
not
all
be
what
call
true
said
the
student
but
true
in
quite
a
lot
of
ways
it
true
psychologically
and
anthropologically
and
palæethnologically
and
that
does
to
start
with
and
i
certainly
ancestors
and
there
a
bracelet
and
you
talking
strange
words
about
a
shore
lark
and
you
must
really
take
care
my
dear
daughter
for
you
now
to
become
a
tribal
priestess
and
be
hurled
from
a
high
place
into
the
sea
the
first
season
that
the
herring
fail
chapter
iii
the
haunted
cave
a
sunlit
sheet
of
sea
violet
and
azure
clothed
in
slender
cloud
shadows
and
heaving
gently
to
the
long
atlantic
up
through
the
calm
water
to
meet
the
eye
of
the
gazer
came
the
green
clearness
of
stone
and
blinks
of
unveined
sand
showing
white
between
the
brown
tangled
blades
of
the
great
and
you
might
see
a
school
of
little
cuddies
heads
all
one
way
playing
hide
and
seek
in
the
sea
forest
and
caring
no
whit
for
the
clumsy
armored
crab
beneath
them
who
crawled
sideways
a
laborious
patch
of
color
in
the
shimmering
transparency
up
out
of
the
deep
water
the
gray
rocks
rose
clear
and
fine
a
mass
of
platforms
and
pinnacles
roughened
with
barnacles
and
tufted
with
dulse
whose
crimson
leaves
floated
and
swung
in
the
white
foam
of
the
lisping
swell
and
above
the
rocks
and
beyond
the
sea
reach
the
cliff
stood
up
black
showing
all
the
strata
that
had
gone
to
the
making
of
it
outlined
with
little
patches
of
coarse
grass
on
one
such
patch
grazed
without
concern
a
sheep
which
had
slipped
over
happy
in
her
ignorance
of
the
fact
that
she
could
never
be
drawn
up
again
alive
the
wiser
raven
overhead
was
clanging
away
with
short
barks
to
tell
his
mate
on
a
ridge
on
the
cliff
side
sat
a
pair
of
young
scarfs
almost
invisible
save
when
they
twisted
their
long
necks
about
like
two
snakes
trying
to
make
up
their
minds
to
follow
their
mother
who
had
just
flopped
clumsily
into
the
water
feet
first
and
had
turned
there
and
then
into
a
miracle
of
easy
grace
as
she
used
her
head
to
dash
the
spray
over
her
back
out
at
sea
a
solan
rose
steadily
in
a
sweeping
spiral
the
white
and
black
of
him
glittering
in
the
sun
suddenly
he
checked
reversed
engines
and
fell
plump
like
an
inverted
cross
his
long
raking
wings
clapping
to
as
he
struck
the
water
a
moment
and
he
was
up
and
there
sat
choking
and
gobbling
over
his
fish
ere
he
rose
again
in
his
majestic
rings
the
two
children
had
grounded
their
boat
on
a
little
pebble
beach
between
the
rocks
and
were
sitting
on
a
big
tuft
of
sea
pinks
munching
handfuls
of
the
sweet
dulse
and
watching
the
solan
at
his
fishing
they
were
by
way
of
fishing
themselves
but
the
afternoon
was
as
yet
too
early
and
too
clear
for
them
the
urchin
had
a
pile
of
stones
beside
him
and
was
apparently
trying
to
see
how
many
times
in
twenty
he
could
miss
a
large
and
obvious
spur
of
rock
fiona
had
a
book
of
poetry
and
was
making
intermittent
efforts
to
read
but
the
world
was
too
full
of
things
to
give
poetry
a
fair
chance
the
urchin
threw
his
last
stone
away
silly
sitting
here
he
said
come
and
explore
so
scrambling
and
sliding
the
two
made
their
way
across
the
rocks
stopping
at
every
rock
pool
to
raise
its
fringe
of
weed
with
careful
hands
and
investigate
the
wonder
of
the
little
world
below
sea
flowers
of
every
hue
white
and
green
gray
and
orange
purple
and
white
and
gray
and
purple
again
some
smooth
and
satisfied
others
with
tentacles
greedily
awash
that
could
be
induced
to
suck
at
a
small
finger
dexterously
inserted
sea
shells
of
every
contour
some
living
and
clutching
at
the
rock
some
cast
off
and
dead
others
again
protruding
alien
claws
resurrected
to
a
life
of
artificial
movement
by
the
little
hermit
crabs
whose
tails
they
sheltered
here
and
there
the
spiky
pink
globe
of
a
sea
urchin
waiting
for
the
tide
to
float
him
off
and
in
one
deep
little
pot
with
sides
green
like
a
grotto
of
ferns
they
found
a
miniature
battle
a
small
green
crab
who
had
cast
his
shell
sat
humped
in
a
recess
of
the
grotto
a
thing
soft
and
vulnerable
a
delight
to
the
enemy
and
in
front
of
him
excited
and
transparent
were
half
a
dozen
shrimps
the
horn
on
each
forehead
pointed
at
him
from
time
to
time
some
young
gallant
would
dash
in
to
prod
the
helpless
monster
and
at
once
backwater
again
into
the
ranks
of
his
friends
the
crab
bore
his
torment
with
a
patience
born
of
the
knowledge
that
each
minute
his
new
carapace
was
hardening
the
shrimps
had
no
wit
to
count
the
cost
or
reckon
the
odds
that
the
rising
tide
might
bear
them
away
in
safety
from
the
day
of
vengeance
on
hands
and
knees
not
daring
to
breathe
on
the
limpid
surface
of
the
pool
the
children
watched
the
little
drama
from
the
cliff
top
the
heated
air
rose
dancing
into
the
sky
so
still
were
earth
and
air
and
sea
that
the
old
finner
rise
sounded
as
though
the
cliff
were
falling
he
had
worked
nearer
in
to
the
rocks
than
seemed
possible
for
his
ninety
feet
of
blubber
and
muscle
and
as
his
black
side
rolled
over
the
water
about
him
boiled
like
a
pot
but
he
did
not
splash
for
he
had
been
well
brought
up
and
always
knew
what
his
tail
was
doing
though
it
was
so
far
away
shiver
these
rocks
he
began
in
a
rage
as
he
flung
two
fountains
out
of
his
nose
then
he
caught
sight
of
fiona
and
the
gleam
of
the
red
bracelet
oh
my
fins
and
flippers
he
spouted
i
ask
pardon
young
lady
i
have
the
manners
of
a
grampus
and
they
told
me
about
you
who
they
asked
fiona
ungrammatically
friends
at
court
friends
at
court
said
the
finner
what
a
thing
to
have
need
of
the
old
sailorman
said
i
but
they
said
i
must
go
and
i
scraped
the
barnacles
off
my
precious
tail
will
it
run
to
some
tobacco
will
what
run
said
the
girl
your
tail
what
is
it
you
want
hints
are
wasted
i
see
said
the
whale
question
said
i
only
one
but
magic
is
magic
you
know
even
for
a
tough
old
sailorman
come
now
one
question
i
too
far
inshore
for
my
liking
fiona
understood
is
it
about
my
treasure
she
said
yours
or
that
boy
there
whichever
you
like
said
the
whale
but
only
one
only
one
for
about
two
seconds
fiona
did
some
hard
mental
drill
then
she
said
will
you
please
tell
me
where
the
urchin
can
find
his
treasure
you
do
have
luck
said
the
finner
think
of
it
then
o
you
little
fishes
think
of
it
if
you
asked
the
other
i
did
know
the
answer
would
have
got
an
answer
and
my
tail
all
scraped
for
nothing
and
this
one
my
saw
it
all
and
nobody
knows
here
but
me
and
the
seals
and
one
man
and
he
too
fat
to
count
west
cave
scargill
island
and
bring
you
luck
my
dear
will
it
run
to
some
tobacco
thank
you
so
much
said
fiona
politely
and
i
sorry
i
have
any
tobacco
with
me
but
if
you
could
wait
a
few
minutes
shiver
it
i
scraping
again
said
the
whale
no
tobacco
and
very
few
barnacles
in
this
world
o
my
grandmother
flukes
i
might
as
well
be
a
bottlenose
once
more
the
water
boiled
and
beneath
it
the
huge
black
body
shot
away
for
the
open
sea
fiona
said
the
boy
do
you
really
think
it
cricket
what
is
cricket
she
asked
fiona
he
said
i
been
a
brother
to
you
i
have
done
all
the
things
a
brother
ought
to
do
i
have
taught
you
to
throw
like
a
boy
i
have
pinched
you
for
new
clothes
i
have
called
you
names
to
make
you
i
have
made
remarks
on
your
personal
appearance
to
prevent
your
being
vain
i
have
even
fought
with
you
solely
for
your
good
and
this
is
how
you
repay
me
the
other
day
you
pretended
to
be
talking
to
a
shore
lark
it
was
an
old
whale
who
spouted
and
banged
his
tail
on
the
rock
if
it
a
joke
i
do
see
it
if
not
a
joke
do
go
into
a
lunatic
asylum
and
let
me
find
a
simpler
job
fiona
tossed
up
mentally
between
hitting
him
and
laughing
it
came
down
laughing
urchin
she
said
it
all
right
i
do
understand
it
much
better
than
you
do
but
it
has
something
to
do
with
this
bracelet
of
mine
i
can
really
understand
them
and
they
can
understand
me
if
you
doubt
my
word
we
will
fight
a
duel
with
the
boat
stretchers
and
i
will
bury
you
in
the
sand
here
afterwards
oh
i
believe
you
when
you
talk
like
that
said
the
urchin
only
it
worse
than
the
latin
grammar
the
parrot
talks
but
this
thing
seemed
to
be
a
whale
it
was
very
like
one
it
was
a
whale
said
fiona
he
said
his
had
seen
the
spanish
captain
land
his
doubloons
and
that
it
was
in
the
west
cave
on
scargill
island
that
means
the
big
cave
at
the
end
facing
the
sea
said
the
boy
the
cave
that
no
one
has
ever
got
to
the
end
of
said
fiona
the
cave
that
haunted
said
the
boy
but
of
course
it
haunted
it
the
ghosts
of
the
spaniards
silly
of
us
not
to
have
guessed
fiona
had
a
hazy
recollection
of
things
her
father
used
to
say
i
expect
the
haunting
is
thousands
of
years
older
than
the
spaniards
she
said
urchin
are
you
afraid
of
ghosts
not
a
bit
said
the
urchin
stoutly
they
would
be
splendid
to
throw
stones
at
it
would
hurt
them
come
on
then
let
go
said
the
girl
there
lots
of
daylight
none
of
the
people
here
will
go
into
it
you
know
said
the
urchin
i
know
said
fiona
all
the
more
reason
for
going
on
our
own
there
might
really
be
something
there
if
no
one
ever
goes
to
take
it
away
so
the
boat
was
launched
and
the
adventure
also
fiona
pulled
stroke
the
urchin
was
a
clumsy
and
unpunctual
bow
and
the
girl
had
to
steer
from
the
stroke
oar
which
needs
more
doing
than
you
may
think
if
you
have
tried
it
but
they
made
the
end
of
scargill
in
time
and
then
fiona
took
both
the
oars
and
coasted
while
the
urchin
got
out
a
couple
of
bamboo
poles
garnished
with
white
flies
and
let
the
casts
trail
occasionally
getting
one
of
the
beautiful
little
scarlet
lythe
that
came
at
the
fly
with
the
spring
and
dash
of
a
sea
trout
for
even
adventurers
need
supper
and
so
they
came
past
many
a
smaller
cave
mouth
in
the
black
side
of
the
island
to
the
huge
bluff
that
fronts
the
full
atlantic
and
the
great
west
cave
atlantic
was
half
asleep
and
muttered
drowsily
to
the
quiet
rocks
outside
but
the
great
cave
was
seldom
quiet
in
the
winter
when
atlantic
turned
himself
restlessly
and
spoke
aloud
the
sound
of
his
speaking
came
back
from
its
depths
like
the
roar
of
a
heavy
gun
and
even
in
the
stillness
the
lisp
of
the
swell
in
it
echoed
as
from
the
roots
of
the
island
in
a
low
intermittent
boom
outside
on
the
calm
water
floated
the
whiskered
head
of
a
seal
watching
the
boat
with
gentle
fearless
eyes
the
officer
on
guard
fiona
whispered
and
from
the
black
cliff
face
like
a
hanging
fringe
over
the
mouth
of
the
cave
the
water
splashed
down
trickle
by
trickle
in
quick
heavy
drops
the
children
rowed
in
through
the
little
shower
and
fiona
paddled
gently
up
the
cave
its
huge
limestone
walls
stood
up
stark
on
either
hand
rising
into
the
darkness
above
and
sinking
below
into
the
green
water
as
far
as
eye
could
follow
them
near
the
grew
a
little
seaweed
and
some
white
whelks
clung
but
as
they
went
down
the
waterway
these
vanished
and
gray
cliff
and
green
water
alike
began
to
turn
black
looking
back
fiona
could
see
a
bright
patch
a
patch
of
sky
and
sea
framed
in
the
narrow
slit
of
the
cave
mouth
the
waterway
was
narrowing
now
she
shipped
her
oars
and
stood
up
using
one
as
a
paddle
and
instructing
the
urchin
how
to
fend
off
the
stern
with
his
hands
in
front
on
a
ledge
in
the
cave
roof
it
was
just
possible
to
make
out
a
row
of
blue
dots
in
the
growing
darkness
as
the
boat
drew
nearer
the
blue
dots
fluttered
detached
themselves
from
the
cliff
and
a
swarm
of
pigeons
came
whirring
over
the
boat
and
down
the
cave
toward
the
sunlight
your
ghosts
urchin
said
the
girl
henceforward
the
cave
was
void
of
life
unless
some
strange
eyeless
fish
lurked
in
its
inky
depths
darker
and
darker
grew
the
waterway
and
the
last
gleam
of
light
vanished
fiona
was
feeling
her
way
now
aided
by
the
phosphorescent
drip
from
her
oar
blade
the
urchin
with
unusual
sense
splashed
his
hands
in
the
water
to
increase
the
pale
glow
which
just
revealed
the
line
of
the
cliff
neither
dare
speak
now
possibly
had
fiona
not
had
some
idea
of
what
was
coming
she
would
have
turned
but
already
there
was
a
faint
gleam
ahead
faint
as
a
glow
worm
but
still
a
gleam
and
as
the
boat
slid
forward
and
the
low
boom
in
the
depths
of
the
cave
grew
closer
the
cave
walls
very
slowly
began
to
grow
gray
again
out
of
the
blackness
a
few
minutes
more
and
the
walls
were
an
outline
and
before
them
a
fringe
of
white
on
round
wet
stones
the
end
of
the
waterway
and
as
the
boat
grounded
fiona
pointed
up
and
the
urchin
looking
saw
a
little
round
hole
a
natural
shaft
ran
down
into
the
cave
from
the
surface
of
the
island
giving
light
enough
for
their
eyes
now
accustomed
to
the
darkness
to
distinguish
outlines
they
drew
their
boat
up
on
the
stones
far
enough
for
the
swell
not
to
dislodge
it
then
the
same
impulse
seized
them
both
and
they
burst
out
laughing
not
aloud
for
something
in
the
place
made
it
impossible
to
laugh
or
talk
aloud
but
in
a
kind
of
mirthless
whisper
we
come
without
any
lights
said
fiona
in
an
undertone
we
have
said
the
urchin
but
probably
the
stuff
is
only
a
few
yards
above
mark
they
would
go
far
in
they
might
have
said
fiona
they
have
had
torches
or
something
let
go
as
far
as
we
can
anyway
as
we
are
here
said
the
urchin
so
they
started
scrambling
over
the
stones
in
the
gray
presently
there
rose
before
them
a
great
mass
of
rock
and
earth
half
blocking
the
cave
it
looked
like
some
old
landslip
it
easy
at
this
end
fiona
said
the
boy
and
up
they
went
to
find
that
the
rock
barrier
blocked
most
of
what
little
light
remained
beyond
was
darkness
we
must
go
back
and
get
light
said
fiona
i
ca
even
see
the
stones
below
a
pause
then
stop
swinging
your
feet
urchin
i
want
to
listen
i
not
said
the
urchin
another
pause
and
then
the
urchin
spoke
again
in
a
kind
of
stage
whisper
i
frightened
the
words
seemed
squeezed
out
of
him
we
may
as
well
go
back
anyhow
said
fiona
in
a
strained
voice
down
you
go
urchin
the
urchin
did
go
down
at
a
considerable
pace
and
ran
for
the
boat
fiona
managed
to
walk
by
repeating
to
herself
all
the
time
under
her
breath
you
must
run
you
must
run
but
once
in
the
boat
she
did
not
rebuke
the
urchin
for
standing
up
and
taking
the
other
oar
and
the
pair
paddled
out
with
many
bumpings
and
scrapings
in
a
more
speedy
and
less
scientific
manner
than
that
in
which
they
had
entered
once
out
in
the
sunlight
they
felt
better
they
started
automatically
to
fish
home
and
presently
were
talking
again
but
neither
of
them
referred
to
the
thing
that
was
uppermost
in
each
mind
though
each
was
wondering
if
the
other
knew
for
as
they
had
sat
on
the
wall
of
rock
each
had
heard
clearly
in
the
utter
darkness
of
the
unvisited
cave
the
sound
of
heavy
footsteps
chapter
iv
the
urchin
vanishes
to
most
people
there
is
some
corner
of
the
earth
which
means
more
than
all
others
and
there
are
two
or
three
in
the
world
whose
holy
place
is
the
old
house
on
the
which
the
student
humbler
neighbors
called
the
big
house
an
old
square
building
of
gray
stone
that
matches
the
gray
sky
and
the
gray
sea
it
has
small
claims
to
beauty
it
was
built
in
the
days
of
blank
windows
and
every
wind
in
the
island
meets
and
screams
round
the
battered
iron
balustrade
which
leads
up
its
steps
to
the
door
and
strives
to
tear
down
the
tendrils
of
ivy
that
cling
to
the
east
front
to
the
south
front
lashed
by
the
full
atlantic
gales
not
even
ivy
can
cling
only
a
few
twisted
elders
and
stunted
planes
grow
there
and
take
the
first
force
of
the
winter
wind
but
the
old
lawn
to
the
north
bursts
in
summer
into
a
cloud
of
white
marguerites
whose
ethereal
beauty
at
sunset
is
like
the
ghosts
of
the
dreams
that
haunt
the
place
for
to
some
of
us
the
old
house
is
full
of
dreams
that
cling
to
the
dark
passages
and
the
uneven
floors
and
play
in
and
out
of
the
little
windows
that
are
still
propped
open
with
wood
as
they
were
a
hundred
years
ago
dreams
of
the
bright
lights
and
the
bright
voices
that
greeted
us
coming
in
out
of
the
blinding
rain
dreams
of
the
dance
and
the
song
songs
of
old
lost
causes
from
which
all
bitterness
has
died
away
leaving
nothing
but
beauty
behind
them
dreams
of
faded
joys
and
forgotten
sorrows
of
loves
that
have
passed
elsewhere
and
of
memories
that
abide
dreams
of
faces
that
are
seen
no
more
some
day
it
will
change
ownership
it
will
be
sold
to
someone
from
whom
understanding
of
these
things
has
been
withheld
and
who
will
see
only
the
darkness
of
the
old
corridors
the
shabbiness
of
the
old
doorway
and
he
will
build
new
doors
and
porticoes
and
a
wide
verandah
and
make
it
fair
within
and
without
levelling
the
floors
and
trimming
the
lawns
and
he
will
have
destroyed
the
old
house
and
the
fragrance
of
it
and
it
will
never
return
but
it
still
stands
as
it
has
stood
for
many
a
long
year
clothed
in
the
memories
that
never
leave
it
and
rich
in
all
that
the
past
has
built
into
it
and
to
some
who
may
never
dwell
there
again
it
is
yet
ever
present
as
the
home
of
their
hearts
desire
a
true
house
of
faery
the
student
had
let
the
old
house
to
the
urchin
father
he
was
a
tall
thin
man
with
a
hooked
nose
and
he
knew
more
about
one
particular
family
of
coleoptera
than
anyone
living
he
had
taken
the
place
not
because
he
wanted
it
for
its
shooting
but
because
one
of
the
beetles
of
his
family
was
reputed
to
be
plentiful
in
the
neighborhood
he
was
never
there
long
he
was
never
anywhere
long
for
thirty
years
he
had
pursued
his
beetles
over
five
continents
his
measurements
of
their
wing
cases
alone
filled
nine
enormous
volumes
his
great
work
on
the
variation
of
the
length
of
the
wing
case
in
beetles
kept
in
captivity
had
become
a
classic
scientific
men
had
nothing
but
praise
for
the
book
several
even
read
it
the
majority
believed
that
he
had
past
any
overthrowing
a
small
but
persistent
minority
argued
that
on
the
contrary
he
had
utterly
overthrown
the
all
however
agreed
that
the
book
was
even
though
they
differed
utterly
as
to
the
sort
of
epoch
which
it
made
the
author
himself
was
a
shy
and
modest
person
who
never
lost
his
temper
except
when
people
sent
him
unpaid
parcels
from
timbuctoo
or
khamchatka
containing
beetles
of
other
families
in
which
he
took
no
interest
on
the
rare
occasions
when
he
could
be
induced
to
go
into
society
hostesses
who
saw
no
reason
why
one
crawling
thing
should
not
do
as
well
as
another
had
been
known
to
try
to
please
him
by
starting
a
conversation
about
ladybirds
or
earwigs
and
it
was
said
to
be
worth
foregoing
one
cigar
to
hear
him
explain
with
a
chuckle
that
though
earwigs
or
ladybirds
were
no
doubt
meritorious
creatures
in
their
several
spheres
and
possibly
legitimate
objects
of
study
to
others
they
were
not
his
subject
his
subject
was
a
particular
family
of
coleoptera
he
and
the
student
had
become
great
friends
and
when
he
was
in
the
island
he
would
often
drop
in
to
see
the
student
bookroom
after
dinner
and
there
the
two
would
sit
one
on
either
side
of
the
fire
each
smoking
at
a
tremendous
pace
and
talking
hard
on
his
own
subject
neither
ever
expected
an
answer
from
the
other
neither
ever
got
one
but
they
had
silently
established
an
unwritten
law
that
when
one
had
talked
for
three
minutes
by
the
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
he
was
to
stop
and
let
the
other
have
a
turn
and
when
at
last
they
said
good
night
each
felt
that
they
had
both
had
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
evening
and
so
they
had
unlike
to
unlike
the
urchin
father
had
married
the
daughter
of
a
stockbroker
who
on
her
death
had
left
him
two
legacies
one
was
the
urchin
and
the
other
was
an
occasional
visitation
from
her
brother
jeconiah
jeconiah
johnson
the
promoter
of
companies
was
a
short
stout
man
with
a
red
face
and
a
shifty
blue
eye
always
immaculately
dressed
in
broadcloth
with
a
huge
expanse
of
white
waistcoat
over
which
sprawled
his
double
watch
chain
and
his
triple
chin
there
were
possibly
some
good
points
even
about
jeconiah
if
anything
so
rotund
could
be
said
to
have
points
but
there
were
certainly
not
many
he
was
supposed
by
some
to
possess
what
is
called
a
high
standard
of
business
morality
it
would
be
truer
to
say
that
his
code
was
prehistoric
he
had
so
far
kept
himself
right
with
the
law
because
he
had
mastered
the
sordid
maxim
which
proclaims
that
honesty
is
the
best
policy
no
other
reason
was
likely
to
occur
to
him
with
some
effort
he
had
succeeded
in
formulating
a
rule
of
conduct
of
which
he
was
rather
proud
do
good
to
yourself
and
your
friends
and
evil
to
those
who
stand
in
your
way
if
anyone
had
told
him
that
the
philosophy
of
ethics
took
its
rise
some
centuries
ago
in
a
reaction
against
a
similar
rule
he
would
have
remarked
jocosely
that
he
never
studied
back
numbers
of
anything
more
exalted
than
policy
anything
not
to
be
reckoned
in
terms
of
he
was
as
ignorant
as
a
hippopotamus
he
was
never
very
fond
of
his
right
hand
knowing
what
his
left
hand
did
for
while
the
right
hand
promoted
companies
the
left
hand
by
means
of
a
manager
and
a
registered
alias
carried
on
a
very
useful
little
business
he
was
never
averse
to
putting
the
screw
on
if
there
was
anything
to
be
got
by
it
and
sometimes
he
got
rather
funny
things
recently
he
had
had
a
broken
debtor
on
his
hands
and
had
taken
what
he
could
get
among
other
things
an
old
bureau
full
of
papers
jeconiah
being
a
methodical
soul
had
turned
a
clerk
on
to
sort
the
papers
and
the
clerk
had
presently
brought
him
the
long
lost
map
of
the
scargill
cave
and
a
sheet
of
paper
containing
somebody
rough
explanation
of
what
it
was
supposed
to
be
jeconiah
who
had
heard
the
story
scented
possibilities
and
it
being
a
slack
time
in
the
city
promptly
invited
himself
to
his
house
to
recover
from
an
attack
of
influenza
that
is
how
jeconiah
comes
into
this
story
it
could
not
be
helped
for
he
had
the
map
the
finner
had
said
he
was
too
fat
to
count
but
that
is
where
the
finner
was
wrong
jeconiah
forthwith
gave
his
mind
such
as
it
was
to
the
subject
of
caves
diffidence
was
not
his
failing
and
he
every
person
he
could
find
concealing
of
course
his
real
object
he
collected
a
splendid
amount
of
rubbish
but
he
was
acute
enough
where
his
pocket
was
concerned
and
out
of
the
rubbish
he
presently
dragged
forth
the
fact
of
the
haunted
cave
which
no
one
would
enter
whereon
jeconiah
went
over
to
scargill
to
fish
and
had
a
look
at
the
lie
of
the
island
settled
with
himself
that
it
seemed
a
good
enough
place
for
a
wreck
and
told
the
keeper
to
row
him
into
the
west
cave
but
the
keeper
who
had
no
particular
liking
for
jeconiah
refused
and
told
him
he
would
not
find
a
man
in
the
island
who
would
do
it
and
jeconiah
who
had
suddenly
lost
interest
in
the
fishing
went
home
in
a
bad
temper
this
happened
the
day
after
the
two
children
were
in
the
cave
and
the
day
after
that
the
father
received
an
excited
cablegram
from
brazil
on
the
subject
of
his
beloved
beetles
he
rushed
down
at
once
to
see
the
student
i
am
going
to
brazil
i
do
know
for
how
long
he
said
and
my
boy
ca
go
back
to
school
for
a
month
or
more
as
they
have
scarlet
fever
in
the
village
there
and
i
do
like
to
leave
him
with
the
housekeeper
and
i
start
in
two
hours
will
you
take
him
delighted
said
the
student
fiona
will
look
after
him
so
the
urchin
came
and
with
him
came
to
fiona
a
sense
of
responsibility
for
him
she
could
help
it
but
jeconiah
showed
no
intention
of
moving
on
the
contrary
the
of
influenza
were
still
troubling
him
sorely
it
seemed
at
last
the
urchin
father
had
to
tell
him
to
stay
a
week
or
two
longer
if
he
wanted
to
the
servants
would
be
there
anyhow
and
jeconiah
thanked
him
and
settled
down
to
stay
as
he
had
meant
to
do
all
along
but
as
soon
as
his
was
gone
he
took
the
car
and
went
off
for
the
day
the
chauffeur
said
that
he
went
to
a
lot
of
places
and
talked
to
a
lot
of
people
and
a
couple
of
days
later
two
strange
men
in
a
boat
entered
the
bay
and
proceeded
to
camp
out
on
a
part
of
the
shore
which
was
not
the
student
property
jeconiah
had
in
fact
hired
the
boat
and
found
a
couple
of
from
the
mainland
who
knew
nothing
of
him
and
were
ready
to
row
him
anywhere
in
pursuit
of
his
business
which
was
understood
to
be
photographing
wild
birds
for
an
illustrated
paper
jeconiah
had
however
made
one
great
mistake
he
was
aware
that
you
must
not
neglect
little
things
and
he
had
neglected
quite
a
big
little
thing
the
urchin
he
had
never
spoken
to
him
about
caves
or
taken
the
least
notice
of
the
boy
movements
and
the
urchin
on
his
side
had
been
hard
at
work
he
had
confessed
to
fiona
on
the
subject
of
the
footsteps
and
she
to
him
and
they
had
agreed
under
the
broad
healthy
light
of
day
that
probably
they
had
been
mistaken
and
afraid
of
the
dark
and
that
with
lanterns
it
would
be
all
right
they
agreed
however
that
it
was
necessary
to
have
a
really
good
light
and
the
difficulty
was
to
find
one
it
was
the
urchin
who
came
forward
as
the
saviour
of
society
by
proposing
to
win
over
jones
the
chauffeur
and
get
the
loan
of
one
of
the
big
acetylene
from
the
car
jones
a
newcomer
had
not
yet
heard
about
the
cave
and
being
english
he
had
not
yet
found
his
feet
among
his
fellows
and
was
glad
of
any
sort
of
diversion
the
urchin
wound
up
a
triumphant
half
hour
of
diplomacy
by
making
jones
promise
to
lend
him
one
of
the
headlights
and
show
him
how
to
work
it
then
the
urchin
fell
as
many
greater
men
have
fallen
he
was
lifted
up
with
pride
and
told
jones
that
fiona
and
he
were
going
jones
grinned
but
that
evening
he
talked
and
in
due
course
jeconiah
heard
fiona
was
digging
in
her
garden
or
rather
in
the
urchin
for
she
had
assigned
him
one
bit
of
it
which
she
had
to
cultivate
for
him
otherwise
it
would
have
run
waste
for
all
the
work
the
urchin
put
into
it
her
garden
was
one
corner
of
the
old
walled
garden
of
the
student
house
which
was
not
very
well
kept
now
once
it
had
been
gay
with
flowers
and
rich
with
fruit
but
now
few
flowers
grew
there
save
such
as
could
look
after
themselves
and
the
fruit
had
come
down
to
two
gnarled
old
apple
trees
in
which
fiona
had
made
her
earliest
experiments
in
climbing
most
of
the
ground
so
far
as
it
was
in
use
was
now
given
over
to
cabbages
and
potatoes
but
in
june
the
borders
were
sweet
with
double
white
narcissus
and
now
in
september
there
was
a
revel
of
unpruned
roses
their
blooms
growing
smaller
year
by
year
and
a
mass
of
the
blossoms
of
the
little
west
coast
fuchsia
which
knows
how
to
live
through
the
winter
one
deserted
corner
was
gay
with
turk
turban
which
still
had
strength
to
push
up
through
the
tangle
of
weeds
and
groups
of
winter
crocus
were
coming
up
in
the
borders
and
among
them
a
few
shirley
poppies
which
fiona
had
sown
herself
fiona
had
had
thoughts
of
taking
the
garden
in
hand
but
the
space
enclosed
by
the
old
walls
was
far
too
large
for
her
to
manage
unaided
and
as
there
was
no
money
to
pay
a
proper
gardener
she
had
had
to
content
herself
with
clearing
one
corner
here
she
had
achieved
a
riot
of
color
she
had
made
a
little
rockery
of
and
beech
ferns
brought
down
from
the
hill
sentinelled
by
tall
pink
foxgloves
the
plum
trees
against
the
wall
behind
were
threaded
and
festooned
with
thick
trailers
of
yellow
and
scarlet
nasturtium
and
in
front
of
the
rockery
her
especial
pride
was
a
great
bed
of
velvet
pansies
rich
with
every
hue
of
the
rainbow
they
were
flanked
by
simple
annuals
filmy
pink
poppies
orange
escholtzias
and
mignonette
and
in
a
bed
by
themselves
were
the
gold
and
crimson
snapdragons
which
the
urchin
had
begged
for
her
from
the
gardener
at
the
big
house
she
must
needs
dig
up
a
centipede
one
of
the
small
yellow
ones
they
were
her
special
dislike
the
centipede
did
not
like
being
dug
up
either
and
writhed
himself
into
seven
different
sets
of
tangles
at
once
as
is
the
way
of
the
smaller
centipedes
you
horrid
little
yellow
beast
she
said
forgetting
that
he
could
understand
and
made
a
dab
at
him
with
her
spade
which
to
her
relief
missed
him
she
felt
she
had
done
her
duty
by
hitting
at
him
but
did
not
hide
from
herself
that
she
had
really
missed
him
on
purpose
little
all
right
said
the
centipede
and
yellow
all
right
and
though
i
not
really
a
beast
we
will
let
it
go
at
that
but
i
not
a
bit
horrid
but
i
do
like
you
said
fiona
and
you
wriggle
so
in
the
circles
in
which
i
move
said
the
centipede
my
wriggling
is
much
admired
and
the
mere
fact
that
you
do
not
like
me
which
i
may
remind
you
is
only
a
subjective
impression
and
has
neither
objective
validity
nor
permanent
value
does
not
entitle
you
to
call
me
names
you
ought
to
have
learnt
better
with
that
bangle
of
yours
for
all
you
know
i
may
be
a
model
of
the
more
unselfish
virtues
but
you
eat
the
roots
of
my
flowers
said
fiona
that
is
the
first
i
have
heard
of
it
said
the
centipede
but
one
lives
and
learns
it
need
not
be
the
same
one
though
who
does
both
so
in
the
present
case
i
propose
that
i
should
live
and
you
should
learn
i
was
going
to
kill
you
really
said
fiona
the
centipede
bowed
a
little
courtesy
does
oil
the
creaking
machinery
of
life
it
he
said
please
lift
me
up
for
i
have
something
to
tell
you
and
your
head
is
so
far
away
shouting
at
you
hurts
my
throat
fiona
stooped
down
and
took
up
the
little
yellow
creature
in
her
hand
congratulations
said
the
centipede
we
getting
on
you
wanted
badly
to
shudder
and
you
did
we
shall
make
something
of
you
yet
my
old
friend
the
bookworm
who
lives
in
your
library
by
the
way
has
recently
supplied
me
with
a
new
quotation
from
the
great
poet
virgil
who
had
once
you
may
remember
quite
a
reputation
as
a
magician
it
was
to
the
effect
that
if
you
get
what
you
wanted
by
beginning
at
the
top
you
should
start
again
at
the
bottom
i
am
the
bottom
i
am
not
the
bottom
but
i
am
near
enough
to
it
for
your
purpose
now
you
see
what
you
have
gained
by
not
killing
me
i
do
see
anything
yet
i
afraid
said
fiona
one
must
have
patience
with
weaker
vessels
said
the
centipede
so
i
will
explain
my
friend
the
bookworm
who
supplies
me
with
my
quotations
has
a
cousin
of
the
same
profession
in
the
library
at
the
big
house
it
was
through
him
that
i
got
the
story
i
am
going
to
tell
you
about
the
fat
man
mr
johnson
exclaimed
fiona
he
has
nothing
to
do
with
me
she
disliked
jeconiah
heartily
so
far
as
she
had
given
any
thought
to
him
oh
yes
he
has
said
the
centipede
this
is
where
i
come
in
my
bookworm
cousin
who
is
a
great
linguist
and
understands
english
perfectly
was
at
work
in
the
library
the
other
evening
and
the
fat
man
was
having
his
coffee
there
after
coffee
he
lit
a
cigar
and
began
to
walk
up
and
down
and
presently
he
started
talking
to
himself
out
loud
as
my
informant
says
he
often
does
when
he
is
excited
and
by
piecing
his
talk
together
my
informant
made
out
that
he
had
the
map
of
the
scargill
cave
which
one
of
your
ancestors
once
gambled
away
and
that
somehow
or
other
he
had
found
out
that
the
cave
of
the
map
the
scargill
cave
and
that
he
was
only
waiting
for
a
smooth
day
to
go
and
locate
the
treasure
well
said
fiona
oh
come
now
said
the
centipede
it
no
use
pretending
we
all
know
that
you
are
remember
we
can
all
understand
everything
say
whether
we
are
linguists
or
not
and
my
advice
to
you
is
to
be
quick
about
it
before
the
fat
man
can
get
his
oar
in
thank
you
so
much
said
fiona
and
i
am
so
sorry
i
began
by
being
rude
tell
me
why
have
you
told
me
all
this
when
i
began
by
being
rude
because
i
am
a
model
of
the
more
unselfish
virtues
of
course
said
the
centipede
with
a
suppressed
chuckle
as
a
fact
i
had
an
from
headquarters
but
we
are
all
backing
you
you
know
and
now
will
you
put
me
down
please
the
upper
air
is
chilly
he
wriggled
into
a
crack
in
the
ground
and
was
gone
that
evening
fiona
and
the
urchin
made
their
final
preparations
in
case
the
morrow
should
fall
calm
that
evening
also
jeconiah
heard
that
he
had
rivals
in
the
field
his
language
as
he
walked
up
and
down
the
library
would
have
been
very
bad
for
the
bookworm
morals
had
that
intelligent
insect
been
able
to
understand
it
all
but
the
bookworm
english
though
good
was
literary
and
much
of
the
modern
idiom
employed
by
jeconiah
slid
off
its
back
jeconiah
plan
had
been
to
make
sure
that
the
gold
was
there
and
then
charter
a
launch
from
glasgow
and
take
it
straight
to
he
saw
now
that
he
could
not
afford
the
time
and
that
unless
he
could
deal
with
the
children
in
some
way
he
might
have
to
take
the
gold
off
in
his
boat
which
would
entail
some
risk
as
well
as
cost
him
a
heavy
sum
to
buy
his
two
boatmen
also
he
made
up
his
mind
that
he
must
go
the
next
morning
whatever
the
weather
if
it
were
possible
to
launch
the
boat
he
knew
that
the
children
with
their
little
skiff
could
only
go
to
sea
on
calm
days
unfortunately
for
jeconiah
the
night
fell
calm
and
though
he
rose
early
he
had
no
notion
of
starting
without
a
good
breakfast
by
the
time
his
boat
was
launched
and
he
himself
aboard
he
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
through
his
glasses
the
children
boat
off
the
east
or
nearer
end
of
scargill
the
wealth
of
adjectives
which
he
employed
in
the
circumstances
filled
his
two
loafers
with
awe
and
admiration
fiona
having
the
urchin
securely
under
her
roof
had
breakfasted
before
dawn
and
as
soon
as
it
was
light
enough
the
children
launched
their
little
boat
the
urchin
had
the
precious
headlight
ready
charged
tied
up
in
an
old
sack
which
would
also
serve
to
bring
away
the
plunder
and
round
his
waist
he
had
twisted
a
length
of
rope
its
use
was
not
apparent
but
he
thought
it
looked
they
saw
that
jeconiah
boat
was
still
drawn
up
ashore
and
in
good
heart
they
started
on
their
long
pull
they
had
reached
the
island
before
jeconiah
had
his
boat
out
having
no
glasses
they
could
not
see
if
it
was
being
launched
or
not
but
off
the
eastern
end
of
the
island
which
is
low
and
grassy
they
had
a
fright
for
an
empty
boat
was
drawn
ashore
there
however
when
they
rowed
close
in
to
look
at
it
fiona
recognized
it
it
angus
maceachan
boat
she
said
he
has
come
to
see
after
the
sheep
he
has
on
the
island
there
he
is
i
can
see
him
he
has
got
a
sheep
that
has
hurt
its
foot
and
indeed
they
could
see
angus
tending
a
sick
sheep
fiona
said
the
boy
we
are
too
silly
for
anything
of
course
the
footsteps
we
heard
in
the
cave
were
angus
there
is
another
way
in
somewhere
and
he
would
be
looking
for
a
sheep
fiona
said
nothing
as
they
neared
the
cave
the
problem
of
the
footsteps
kept
intruding
itself
more
and
more
vividly
upon
her
but
the
urchin
was
happy
in
his
theory
and
she
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
remind
him
that
the
footsteps
could
not
possibly
have
been
those
of
angus
who
walked
with
a
limp
she
began
to
feel
a
vague
sense
of
disquiet
which
she
tried
in
vain
to
put
aside
they
entered
the
cave
and
the
urchin
with
much
pride
lit
his
great
lamp
the
powerful
burner
threw
a
wonderful
circle
of
light
on
to
black
water
and
black
walls
making
them
glow
and
sparkle
with
a
soft
radiance
till
they
looked
like
the
very
gateway
of
fairyland
outside
the
circle
everything
became
black
as
pitch
they
paddled
quietly
up
the
bright
waterway
and
grounded
on
the
stones
at
the
end
the
urchin
was
hot
after
his
long
row
and
helping
to
draw
the
boat
up
on
the
stones
did
not
make
him
any
cooler
he
took
off
his
jacket
and
pitched
it
on
to
a
thwart
yes
it
is
hot
and
stuffy
said
fiona
she
recollected
some
story
she
had
read
about
a
coal
mine
and
sniffed
i
hope
there
is
no
gas
here
she
said
the
urchin
grinned
oh
you
girls
he
said
who
ever
heard
of
gas
in
a
sea
cave
what
you
are
smelling
is
the
lamp
fiona
took
the
lamp
up
i
going
to
take
charge
of
this
myself
she
said
you
can
carry
the
treasure
the
urchin
picked
up
the
sack
and
threw
it
over
his
shoulder
go
ahead
lady
with
the
lamp
he
said
and
grinned
again
he
felt
very
adventurous
he
would
rather
have
liked
to
be
photographed
with
considerable
caution
necessitated
by
the
heavy
lamp
they
climbed
the
rock
barrier
and
descended
into
the
darkness
of
the
inner
cave
the
walking
was
better
here
the
rounded
slippery
boulders
had
given
place
to
a
floor
of
pebbles
and
sand
quite
a
short
way
from
the
barrier
the
wall
of
the
cave
curved
away
in
a
semicircle
on
the
right
its
smooth
surface
forming
a
kind
of
small
recess
fiona
swept
the
recess
with
her
lamp
and
on
the
sandy
floor
something
gleamed
back
the
urchin
pounced
on
it
and
picked
it
up
it
was
a
gold
coin
not
the
least
like
any
which
the
children
had
ever
seen
it
was
in
fact
a
doubloon
this
must
be
one
of
them
said
the
boy
exultantly
as
he
pocketed
it
one
that
got
dropped
come
on
it
ca
be
much
farther
but
fiona
held
the
lamp
steady
and
stared
at
the
sand
look
at
the
marks
on
the
sand
she
said
they
are
like
the
marks
of
heavy
boxes
the
treasure
has
been
here
urchin
and
it
not
here
now
someone
has
been
here
and
taken
it
and
dropped
one
piece
i
do
think
so
said
the
urchin
we
shall
find
them
a
bit
farther
on
so
they
went
on
but
not
very
far
for
the
light
of
the
lamp
suddenly
fell
on
a
rock
wall
before
them
the
end
of
the
cave
and
it
had
ended
not
as
the
other
caves
do
by
the
roof
growing
lower
and
lower
till
it
meets
the
floor
it
had
ended
in
this
huge
chamber
of
high
rocky
walls
so
this
is
the
cave
that
no
one
has
ever
reached
the
end
of
said
fiona
why
it
goes
no
distance
at
all
they
retraced
their
steps
to
the
recess
and
then
back
to
the
end
again
looking
on
this
side
and
on
that
for
openings
but
it
seemed
quite
clear
that
there
were
none
the
boxes
must
have
been
carried
off
by
sea
said
fiona
but
the
urchin
had
an
idea
no
one
would
try
to
carry
great
heavy
boxes
over
the
rock
barrier
he
said
they
just
take
the
gold
out
in
sacks
the
barrier
may
be
a
said
fiona
the
treasure
may
all
have
been
cleared
out
long
ago
and
then
there
came
to
the
urchin
the
realization
of
the
fact
that
he
had
lost
his
gun
he
turned
very
red
it
a
shame
he
said
angrily
an
awful
shame
it
was
given
to
me
and
someone
has
taken
it
ca
you
think
where
it
could
be
fiona
i
go
to
find
it
whatever
fiona
may
have
been
going
to
say
her
words
tailed
off
into
sudden
silence
for
from
beyond
the
cave
wall
as
it
seemed
sounded
again
the
footsteps
which
they
had
heard
before
and
this
time
they
knew
that
there
was
no
cave
there
and
that
it
was
walking
through
solid
rock
as
if
along
a
road
there
was
no
question
this
time
of
any
concealment
or
pretence
both
frankly
turned
tail
and
made
for
the
rock
barrier
halfway
there
the
urchin
tripped
and
fell
heavily
on
his
head
fiona
put
the
lamp
down
and
helped
him
up
dizzy
and
shaking
can
you
go
on
urchin
she
said
if
not
i
try
and
carry
you
the
urchin
looked
back
into
the
blackness
unrelieved
by
any
ray
of
the
lamp
which
faced
the
other
way
the
footsteps
were
steadily
drawing
nearer
neither
hasting
nor
staying
what
the
urchin
may
have
thought
he
saw
fiona
could
not
guess
he
gave
one
shriek
slid
out
of
her
grasp
and
bolted
for
the
rock
barrier
as
fast
as
his
trembling
feet
would
carry
him
for
one
moment
fiona
all
but
followed
him
then
it
suddenly
came
to
her
that
she
was
responsible
for
the
boy
safety
she
never
knew
afterwards
how
she
managed
to
do
what
she
did
but
she
turned
and
with
the
courage
of
utter
desperation
the
courage
which
enables
the
hen
partridge
to
face
the
sparrow
hawk
stood
at
bay
swinging
up
the
heavy
lamp
to
see
and
face
whatever
should
come
and
into
the
circle
of
lamplight
quietly
walked
the
figure
of
the
old
hawker
the
revulsion
of
feeling
was
too
much
for
fiona
she
sprang
forward
and
caught
the
old
man
hand
and
clung
to
it
oh
she
said
i
so
glad
it
you
we
heard
the
footsteps
and
we
were
so
frightened
the
relief
of
it
all
was
overwhelming
she
was
almost
crying
and
went
on
saying
anything
hardly
knowing
what
she
said
just
for
the
mere
human
companionableness
of
it
how
did
you
come
here
i
suppose
you
came
over
with
angus
in
his
boat
of
course
you
would
then
there
must
be
another
way
into
the
cave
after
all
and
we
could
find
it
and
so
i
frightened
you
said
the
old
man
gently
making
no
effort
to
withdraw
his
hand
yes
there
is
another
way
in
he
made
no
attempt
to
answer
all
her
questions
urchin
called
fiona
raising
her
voice
urchin
come
back
all
right
but
there
was
no
answer
urchin
she
shouted
urchin
but
there
was
no
answer
save
the
echoing
of
the
empty
cave
he
was
going
down
to
the
boat
she
said
loyally
repressing
the
fact
that
the
urchin
had
bolted
we
must
go
after
him
for
he
had
hurt
his
head
and
i
am
afraid
of
his
falling
again
they
climbed
the
rock
barrier
and
made
their
way
to
the
boat
the
boat
lay
there
as
it
had
been
left
half
ashore
with
the
swell
rippling
against
the
stern
and
over
one
thwart
the
urchin
jacket
just
as
he
had
thrown
it
down
and
the
boat
was
as
empty
as
the
cave
into
fiona
eyes
came
a
sudden
fear
he
must
have
fallen
again
and
be
lying
somewhere
she
said
they
went
back
searching
every
nook
and
corner
of
the
cave
turning
the
light
into
every
crevice
under
every
rock
making
a
minute
examination
of
the
rock
barrier
and
there
was
no
sign
and
then
fiona
broke
down
he
is
drowned
she
said
and
just
sat
and
sobbed
after
a
few
moments
the
old
man
came
and
sat
down
beside
her
in
his
gentle
voice
he
said
that
the
urchin
could
not
possibly
be
drowned
the
water
was
quite
shallow
at
the
edge
and
he
was
a
good
swimmer
was
he
not
and
even
if
he
had
not
been
the
swell
would
have
rolled
him
ashore
he
himself
had
no
doubt
that
all
would
come
right
fiona
ceased
sobbing
and
turned
on
him
do
you
know
where
he
is
she
demanded
bluntly
how
would
i
know
when
you
do
not
know
said
the
old
man
could
i
see
what
you
could
not
see
and
then
listen
down
the
waterway
came
voices
and
the
sound
of
oars
it
was
in
fact
jeconiah
boat
entering
the
cave
fiona
caught
at
the
straw
he
may
have
swum
out
to
the
other
boat
she
said
but
there
was
no
one
in
the
other
boat
but
jeconiah
and
his
two
men
they
had
powerful
lanterns
and
the
boat
was
full
of
sacks
jeconiah
himself
was
purple
with
suppressed
rage
and
impatience
the
moment
he
could
get
ashore
he
waddled
up
to
fiona
and
shook
the
map
of
the
cave
in
her
face
exclaiming
remember
if
you
have
found
anything
it
belongs
to
me
and
i
claim
it
fiona
had
only
one
thought
in
her
mind
at
the
moment
and
the
foolish
impertinence
of
the
little
fat
man
was
to
her
merely
so
much
unnecessary
sound
her
answer
was
have
you
seen
the
urchin
we
have
lost
him
did
he
not
swim
out
to
your
boat
she
was
almost
sobbing
again
confound
the
brat
said
jeconiah
roughly
i
not
come
here
to
play
with
a
parcel
of
children
tell
me
at
once
what
you
found
fiona
straightened
herself
and
looked
at
jeconiah
as
though
he
were
some
noxious
reptile
there
was
nothing
here
to
find
she
said
and
this
cave
belongs
to
my
father
and
anything
in
it
he
gave
to
the
urchin
well
he
not
here
said
jeconiah
brutally
and
i
am
who
finds
keeps
and
calling
to
his
men
to
bring
the
lights
he
set
off
between
stumbling
and
crawling
for
the
rock
barrier
one
of
the
men
had
the
decency
to
stop
a
moment
and
tell
fiona
that
they
had
seen
nothing
of
any
boy
jeconiah
turned
and
abused
him
for
a
laggard
with
a
good
deal
of
difficulty
the
two
men
hoisted
and
shoved
jeconiah
over
the
rock
barrier
once
over
he
took
a
light
himself
told
the
men
to
wait
where
they
were
and
after
a
good
look
at
the
map
set
out
for
the
recess
where
the
urchin
had
found
the
doubloon
fiona
followed
him
there
was
some
vague
idea
in
her
mind
of
protecting
the
property
behind
that
there
was
still
a
faint
subconscious
hope
that
in
some
way
or
other
the
urchin
would
suddenly
reappear
and
laugh
at
her
terrors
jeconiah
reached
the
recess
he
saw
and
understood
the
marks
of
the
boxes
on
the
sand
he
swung
round
on
fiona
with
a
snarl
like
that
of
a
hungry
wolf
you
think
you
clever
do
you
you
and
your
father
he
said
i
suppose
you
had
the
stuff
moved
but
i
have
it
if
i
go
to
the
middle
of
the
earth
for
it
it
was
the
old
hawker
who
shouted
he
had
stood
apart
a
silent
spectator
of
the
scene
and
at
this
moment
he
called
out
in
a
voice
of
surprising
power
for
so
frail
a
body
look
out
above
you
jump
fiona
who
had
learned
to
obey
jumped
back
just
in
time
but
jeconiah
had
never
learnt
to
obey
any
orders
but
his
own
he
stood
stupidly
staring
as
a
bit
of
the
roof
of
the
cave
bowed
downward
gave
way
and
came
cascading
about
him
in
a
shower
of
earth
and
big
stones
that
filled
the
air
with
thick
dust
when
the
dust
cleared
again
they
saw
jeconiah
lying
on
his
back
in
the
middle
of
the
cliff
fall
motionless
and
to
all
appearance
dead
but
fiona
was
not
looking
at
jeconiah
she
was
looking
at
the
place
where
the
roof
of
the
cave
had
bowed
itself
before
falling
and
into
her
mind
came
crowding
dim
forgotten
legends
legends
of
fear
and
hope
and
she
was
saying
over
and
over
again
to
herself
as
though
she
might
miss
its
purport
that
behind
the
cliff
fall
as
if
impelling
and
directing
it
she
had
seen
a
small
brown
elfin
hand
it
was
the
old
hawker
who
took
charge
of
the
situation
the
two
men
who
at
first
had
looked
as
if
they
would
run
became
amenable
when
he
spoke
to
them
they
carried
jeconiah
body
to
his
boat
and
laid
it
in
the
one
of
the
men
pointed
out
that
there
was
no
mark
at
all
on
his
face
or
head
and
that
he
did
not
believe
he
had
been
struck
died
of
fright
i
expect
he
said
curtly
lucky
we
stood
out
for
wages
in
advance
said
his
companion
it
looked
as
if
this
might
be
jeconiah
fitting
epitaph
the
old
man
himself
went
with
fiona
in
her
boat
but
he
was
too
feeble
to
row
far
so
he
landed
on
the
island
and
went
in
search
of
angus
in
due
course
angus
came
down
and
rowed
fiona
home
saying
that
the
old
man
was
going
to
look
after
his
sheep
for
him
till
he
returned
it
did
not
occur
to
fiona
until
they
had
gone
too
far
to
turn
back
that
it
looked
as
though
the
old
man
wished
to
avoid
questions
her
mind
was
in
a
helpless
whirl
in
which
everything
seemed
unreal
except
the
urchin
and
that
small
brown
hand
she
could
not
give
her
father
any
very
coherent
account
of
what
had
happened
but
he
went
out
at
once
to
find
a
boat
and
men
to
search
the
cave
jeconiah
was
laid
on
his
bed
in
the
big
house
and
there
was
much
commotion
there
this
one
must
go
for
the
doctor
and
that
one
for
the
student
scared
maids
stood
and
whispered
in
the
corridors
the
two
loafers
heroes
of
the
hour
feasted
happily
in
the
kitchen
then
the
doctor
came
and
went
upstairs
with
a
grave
face
as
befitted
the
occasion
but
he
did
not
come
down
again
and
surmise
grew
half
an
hour
passed
before
the
door
opened
and
the
doctor
smiling
and
rubbing
his
hands
together
came
into
the
library
where
the
student
had
just
entered
and
was
talking
to
the
housekeeper
he
not
dead
at
all
said
the
doctor
it
catalepsy
suspended
animation
you
know
like
the
frog
in
the
marble
had
a
shock
you
tell
me
just
so
just
so
how
long
oh
he
may
be
an
hour
and
he
may
be
a
month
no
one
can
ever
say
never
had
the
good
luck
to
see
a
case
before
not
uncommon
no
must
try
to
rouse
him
you
know
might
be
dangerous
just
wait
send
for
me
at
once
if
he
comes
to
can
get
two
nurses
to
watch
him
if
you
like
just
as
well
perhaps
sometimes
they
are
odd
when
they
wake
think
they
are
someone
else
for
a
bit
you
know
change
their
habits
and
so
on
dual
personality
oh
yes
several
cases
but
i
do
mean
as
much
as
that
might
arise
this
way
of
course
but
what
i
mean
is
more
just
queer
but
of
course
he
need
not
be
might
wake
up
as
if
been
asleep
if
it
lasts
long
take
away
all
the
almanacs
and
things
in
case
he
gets
a
shock
well
good
day
good
day
and
the
doctor
went
and
jeconiah
body
lay
still
on
the
bed
waiting
till
his
soul
if
he
had
one
should
return
to
it
so
the
student
went
home
again
and
on
his
way
he
met
the
old
hawker
who
stopped
and
spoke
to
him
and
for
a
few
moments
the
two
walked
together
the
old
man
talking
rather
quickly
fiona
watching
from
the
window
of
the
bookroom
could
see
that
her
father
first
looked
puzzled
and
then
grave
and
then
considerably
relieved
in
a
dim
kind
of
way
she
found
herself
thinking
that
angus
must
have
rowed
back
very
fast
to
scargill
if
the
old
hawker
were
already
landed
she
was
wondering
who
he
really
was
and
why
her
father
talked
to
him
tell
anne
to
get
us
something
to
eat
anything
said
the
student
the
boat
will
be
here
directly
the
student
by
straining
what
remained
of
old
loyalty
as
far
as
he
dared
had
found
half
a
dozen
volunteers
good
men
to
face
the
haunted
cave
provided
he
went
himself
do
you
want
to
come
fiona
he
said
of
course
fiona
meant
to
come
and
while
they
waited
the
student
questioned
fiona
and
had
the
whole
story
coherently
except
the
hand
that
part
fiona
felt
she
could
not
tell
there
in
the
cheerful
bookroom
it
seemed
so
impossible
once
or
twice
he
nodded
and
said
that
would
be
so
and
at
the
end
he
pointed
out
that
whatever
had
happened
had
happened
when
her
back
was
turned
as
she
faced
the
coming
footsteps
she
had
not
thought
of
that
what
puzzled
her
and
hurt
her
a
little
was
that
though
her
father
seemed
to
feel
for
he
did
not
appear
to
be
particularly
concerned
about
the
urchin
i
believe
it
will
come
right
was
all
he
said
the
boat
arrived
rowed
by
strong
hands
the
men
worked
with
a
will
and
the
distance
to
the
cave
seemed
short
they
had
brought
good
lights
and
the
student
had
a
powerful
electric
torch
high
and
low
they
searched
the
cave
and
found
nothing
one
man
who
was
a
good
swimmer
dived
several
times
and
found
nothing
there
either
tracking
footsteps
was
impossible
the
sand
where
there
was
any
had
been
hopelessly
trampled
when
nothing
more
could
be
done
the
student
said
that
he
wanted
to
look
for
a
thing
himself
which
he
had
an
idea
of
he
went
down
to
the
end
of
the
cave
with
his
torch
and
tapped
the
wall
with
a
geological
hammer
fiona
sat
on
the
rock
barrier
and
watched
him
what
he
was
seeking
she
had
no
idea
he
came
slowly
back
down
the
cave
tapping
the
wall
till
he
reached
the
recess
where
the
urchin
had
picked
up
the
doubloon
he
went
straight
to
the
back
of
the
recess
and
tapped
the
wall
there
and
even
as
he
did
so
a
large
piece
of
stone
fell
from
above
and
smashed
the
electric
torch
in
his
hand
he
came
back
to
the
rock
barrier
quite
unperturbed
looking
as
if
he
had
found
what
he
sought
not
very
safe
this
cave
he
said
calmly
and
told
the
men
to
push
off
the
boat
there
is
nothing
more
we
can
do
he
said
the
boy
is
certainly
not
here
the
men
courage
was
fast
ebbing
away
they
were
glad
to
get
out
of
the
haunted
place
fiona
sat
in
silence
all
the
way
home
it
was
dark
before
they
reached
the
house
she
waited
while
anne
bustled
over
supper
she
thought
she
would
never
see
her
father
alone
at
last
supper
was
over
and
he
went
into
the
bookroom
and
began
to
light
his
pipe
she
followed
him
her
words
came
out
in
a
torrent
daddy
she
said
what
does
it
all
mean
and
why
are
you
so
strange
and
unconcerned
what
did
that
old
man
tell
you
if
i
could
see
must
have
seen
for
he
was
facing
what
is
it
you
know
and
why
have
you
told
me
nothing
sit
down
little
daughter
said
the
student
he
drew
her
beside
his
knee
with
her
head
on
his
arm
i
will
tell
you
now
what
i
can
the
old
man
gave
me
a
sort
of
hint
he
did
not
really
see
for
the
lamp
was
the
other
way
i
fancy
he
guessed
i
wanted
to
test
what
he
said
to
me
i
have
tested
it
now
with
my
hammer
it
all
agrees
i
am
absolutely
certain
that
no
harm
has
come
to
the
urchin
but
i
can
do
nothing
for
him
myself
and
i
must
not
even
tell
you
what
i
think
for
if
i
do
it
ruins
everything
all
i
may
tell
you
is
this
that
you
are
the
only
person
who
can
do
anything
you
will
have
to
do
it
all
yourself
and
by
yourself
little
daughter
i
believe
you
have
ways
and
means
of
your
own
of
finding
out
are
you
going
through
with
it
fiona
of
course
i
am
daddy
she
said
how
can
i
do
anything
else
if
only
i
knew
what
it
is
i
have
to
do
to
find
him
how
to
begin
even
i
can
not
even
tell
you
that
said
the
student
but
his
fingers
played
with
the
copper
bangle
on
her
wrist
and
out
of
some
dim
corner
of
subconsciousness
she
seemed
to
hear
a
small
voice
which
said
if
you
ca
get
what
you
want
by
beginning
at
the
top
you
must
start
again
at
the
bottom
her
father
with
his
learning
was
the
top
the
bottom
fiona
went
to
bed
less
miserable
than
she
had
expected
chapter
v
the
oread
fiona
was
out
long
before
breakfast
next
morning
digging
furiously
in
her
garden
not
many
minutes
passed
before
she
was
rewarded
by
a
glint
of
something
yellow
in
a
shovelful
of
earth
and
there
was
the
centipede
you
dear
creature
she
said
and
caught
it
up
quickly
before
it
could
wriggle
away
how
polite
we
are
this
morning
said
the
centipede
swelling
with
conscious
pride
i
suppose
we
want
something
fiona
mind
was
far
too
completely
taken
up
with
her
one
object
to
notice
or
resent
any
insinuations
yes
i
do
she
said
you
told
me
that
if
i
could
not
get
what
i
wanted
by
beginning
at
the
top
i
must
start
again
at
the
bottom
i
can
do
nothing
from
the
top
this
time
so
i
come
to
you
flattered
to
be
sure
said
the
centipede
how
frank
we
are
please
do
be
cross
said
fiona
humbly
i
am
only
doing
what
you
told
me
to
do
bless
you
child
i
not
cross
said
the
centipede
i
a
philosopher
do
philosophers
get
cross
asked
the
girl
never
said
the
centipede
and
when
they
do
they
call
it
something
else
what
the
matter
with
me
is
that
i
sprained
my
seventh
ankle
on
bow
side
counting
from
the
tail
do
say
you
sorry
for
you
not
anyone
can
see
you
not
you
are
horrid
said
fiona
and
the
other
day
you
were
so
nice
that
what
makes
me
such
a
charming
companion
said
the
centipede
you
never
know
what
to
expect
so
i
never
pall
i
want
to
know
where
the
urchin
is
and
how
i
am
to
find
him
said
fiona
is
that
all
said
the
centipede
fancy
interrupting
my
breakfast
on
account
of
that
boy
well
one
question
at
a
time
we
have
the
last
one
first
i
in
that
sort
of
mood
how
can
i
find
the
urchin
then
please
asked
fiona
well
you
been
told
already
said
the
centipede
you
a
memory
fiona
thought
and
thought
but
could
make
nothing
of
it
my
friend
the
bookworm
was
there
at
the
time
said
the
centipede
and
heard
the
shore
lark
tell
you
that
the
last
man
went
up
a
hill
very
well
go
up
a
hill
but
that
was
for
something
quite
different
said
fiona
that
was
for
my
treasure
i
am
not
thinking
of
any
treasure
now
silly
of
you
then
said
the
centipede
i
would
be
ever
studied
philosophy
no
said
fiona
that
a
pity
said
the
centipede
then
you
never
heard
of
hegel
and
the
unity
of
opposites
black
and
white
are
only
different
aspects
of
the
same
thing
you
know
and
as
soon
as
you
begin
to
think
about
it
you
see
at
once
how
sensible
it
is
well
a
and
a
are
only
different
aspects
of
a
hunt
are
they
therefore
they
are
the
same
thing
therefore
what
does
for
one
does
for
the
other
therefore
you
go
up
a
hill
there
logic
for
you
and
once
more
he
swelled
proudly
thank
you
very
much
said
fiona
and
now
will
you
please
tell
me
where
the
urchin
is
tell
you
exclaimed
the
centipede
why
it
was
you
told
me
you
prophesied
the
whole
thing
i
sure
i
do
remember
it
then
said
fiona
what
the
matter
with
said
the
centipede
is
that
you
refuse
to
exert
your
intelligence
such
as
it
is
you
should
take
a
lesson
by
me
you
humans
are
all
forgetting
nowadays
that
the
spoken
word
is
an
instrument
of
great
power
and
that
once
it
is
launched
it
goes
on
and
on
and
can
work
magic
on
its
own
account
quite
independently
of
you
if
you
say
a
thing
will
happen
it
frequently
does
happen
but
what
did
i
say
asked
fiona
you
told
the
urchin
that
if
he
hurt
the
shore
lark
the
little
people
would
take
him
well
they
taken
him
that
all
and
the
centipede
slid
down
on
to
the
ground
and
with
something
like
a
chuckle
vanished
he
had
evidently
learned
from
his
philosophy
to
bear
with
resignation
the
misfortunes
of
others
but
fiona
did
not
set
off
up
a
hill
at
once
after
breakfast
she
went
to
the
bookroom
and
spoke
to
her
father
i
have
found
out
where
the
urchin
is
daddy
she
said
he
was
carried
off
by
the
fairies
the
student
showed
no
surprise
you
have
not
been
long
finding
out
fiona
he
said
i
thought
you
had
ways
and
means
of
your
own
but
daddy
she
said
i
do
believe
it
you
know
it
sounds
so
absurd
nowadays
do
you
believe
it
i
believe
it
yes
said
the
student
i
knew
yesterday
now
that
you
know
i
may
talk
to
you
about
it
so
far
i
do
know
that
i
do
really
know
she
said
things
like
that
do
happen
do
they
whoever
heard
of
it
you
and
i
have
heard
of
it
he
answered
and
that
is
enough
the
proposition
that
people
are
not
carried
off
by
fairies
is
a
mere
working
hypothesis
liable
to
be
overthrown
by
any
one
case
to
the
contrary
well
we
got
a
case
to
the
contrary
and
that
the
end
of
the
hypothesis
i
arguing
against
myself
daddy
you
know
she
said
i
want
to
believe
that
we
do
know
where
he
is
no
difficulty
at
all
said
the
student
to
anyone
with
a
properly
trained
mind
like
yours
and
mine
take
it
this
way
no
one
has
ever
crossed
the
south
arabian
desert
or
explored
the
snow
ranges
of
new
guinea
have
they
well
for
all
anyone
can
say
to
the
contrary
people
may
be
carried
off
by
fairies
every
day
of
the
week
in
new
guinea
or
south
arabia
may
they
it
may
even
be
the
rule
there
it
may
be
a
working
hypothesis
among
the
pygmies
of
new
guinea
that
such
a
thing
happens
at
death
for
instance
it
would
be
just
as
good
a
working
hypothesis
as
it
is
that
it
happens
but
daddy
it
would
be
so
extraordinary
would
it
not
a
bit
more
extraordinary
he
said
than
the
inside
of
a
bit
of
radium
or
the
inside
of
an
egg
for
that
matter
it
is
probably
simpler
for
the
urchin
to
become
a
fairy
than
for
an
egg
to
become
a
bird
or
a
caterpillar
a
butterfly
it
would
not
be
nearly
as
strange
as
it
is
that
there
is
a
water
beast
which
can
shed
its
gills
and
become
a
land
beast
or
that
uranus
moons
go
round
the
wrong
way
you
ca
knock
it
out
by
any
reasoning
of
that
kind
fiona
it
merely
a
matter
of
fact
and
if
we
have
found
a
case
we
found
a
case
then
you
knew
yesterday
daddy
she
said
i
had
a
very
fair
idea
he
answered
that
is
why
i
was
tapping
in
the
cave
with
a
hammer
can
you
guess
why
fiona
saw
to
find
the
rest
of
the
cave
she
said
that
is
where
he
would
be
just
so
said
the
student
these
caves
can
not
end
in
a
wall
as
that
one
seems
to
i
thought
the
wall
must
ring
hollow
somewhere
and
the
hollow
is
in
the
recess
where
the
stone
nearly
fell
on
me
the
apparent
end
of
the
cave
is
not
in
the
line
of
the
true
cave
at
all
it
is
the
same
place
where
the
stones
fell
on
johnson
said
fiona
that
is
strange
said
the
student
and
then
fiona
told
about
the
hand
she
had
seen
of
course
of
course
said
the
student
that
explains
the
whole
thing
they
threw
the
stone
down
on
me
too
they
did
not
wish
me
to
know
that
the
wall
was
hollow
just
there
they
must
use
it
as
a
doorway
they
will
have
carried
the
boy
through
at
the
moment
that
you
turned
your
back
of
course
i
suppose
he
invited
them
in
some
way
they
could
have
no
power
otherwise
he
said
he
would
go
to
find
his
treasure
said
fiona
that
would
be
quite
sufficient
for
them
to
act
on
said
the
student
then
the
stories
about
the
cruelty
of
the
little
people
are
true
asked
fiona
only
in
part
said
the
student
i
take
it
that
they
are
all
sorts
like
ourselves
they
are
as
you
know
the
vanished
débris
of
all
the
peoples
that
have
helped
to
make
this
planet
what
it
is
good
people
many
of
them
but
they
can
not
altogether
love
those
who
have
driven
them
under
the
ground
and
who
is
the
old
hawker
daddy
she
asked
and
what
has
he
to
do
with
it
all
i
ca
talk
about
anything
except
what
you
already
know
said
the
student
have
you
found
out
yet
how
to
start
i
am
to
go
up
a
hill
said
fiona
and
i
am
going
up
heleval
now
and
i
came
to
see
if
you
would
come
with
me
i
wish
i
could
i
wish
very
much
i
could
said
the
student
i
do
not
know
what
you
may
find
but
i
know
well
that
if
i
went
with
you
you
would
find
nothing
but
grass
and
rock
i
am
too
old
to
see
the
things
you
can
see
you
know
you
have
to
do
it
alone
little
daughter
so
fiona
filled
her
pocket
with
bread
and
cheese
and
started
and
the
student
after
a
useless
attempt
to
settle
down
to
his
inscriptions
set
up
a
little
telescope
with
which
he
sometimes
entertained
fiona
on
fine
nights
gazing
at
jupiter
moons
or
saturn
rings
and
followed
her
across
the
moor
as
far
as
he
could
it
was
the
only
way
he
could
go
with
her
there
are
many
worse
things
in
the
world
than
setting
out
to
climb
heleval
on
a
beautiful
morning
on
the
first
of
october
when
the
grass
in
unsunned
corners
is
still
pearly
with
the
frost
of
the
night
and
the
whole
earth
is
touched
with
the
wonderful
caress
of
the
cool
autumn
sunshine
fiona
way
lay
along
the
shore
road
past
the
bank
of
heather
and
fern
which
in
august
had
been
gay
with
flowers
napperd
and
potentilla
blue
milkwort
and
starry
and
alive
with
butterflies
blues
and
small
heaths
and
fritillaries
but
the
flowers
were
faded
now
and
in
their
place
in
the
little
burn
where
the
hazelnuts
grew
was
a
tapestry
of
purple
burrs
and
scarlet
hips
the
shore
road
ended
at
a
little
burn
here
an
old
stone
bridge
grown
over
with
grass
crossed
the
pool
which
in
times
of
spate
would
hold
a
fat
white
and
here
fiona
and
the
urchin
had
used
to
come
in
summer
to
gather
globe
flowers
from
this
point
a
sheep
track
led
up
the
valley
beside
the
burn
through
great
spaces
of
yellowing
bracken
by
little
swampy
springs
where
late
still
lingered
and
an
early
snipe
might
rise
with
a
skeep
and
across
wastes
of
perfuming
all
the
air
with
its
dying
leaves
then
the
ground
began
to
rise
and
fern
and
gave
place
to
short
hard
grass
tufted
with
bulrushes
and
beds
of
matted
unburnt
heather
seamed
with
rabbit
tracks
after
a
time
fiona
left
the
valley
and
began
to
climb
the
hillside
rising
steeply
through
heather
and
red
grass
and
heather
again
most
of
it
dying
by
now
but
with
patches
still
in
full
flower
worked
by
the
wild
bees
and
making
the
moorland
smell
like
a
then
more
grass
and
limestone
ridges
and
she
stood
on
the
crest
of
the
moor
which
billowed
away
on
her
right
wave
after
wave
till
it
ran
down
to
the
low
ground
and
the
sea
and
rose
up
on
her
left
till
it
ended
in
the
great
mass
of
heleval
standing
up
into
the
cloudless
sky
the
ground
before
her
was
scarred
with
deep
their
gray
banks
touched
with
the
tiny
scarlet
blossoms
of
the
while
from
their
crumbling
sides
projected
bits
of
the
whitened
trunks
of
trees
long
since
dead
last
vestiges
of
the
forests
that
had
clothed
the
island
ere
ever
the
gael
first
fought
his
way
in
walking
became
impossible
and
she
jumped
from
gray
bank
to
gray
bank
occasionally
floundering
across
a
little
lake
of
soft
peat
where
the
wild
cotton
grass
still
bloomed
and
the
mountain
hares
had
left
telltale
tracks
now
and
again
a
hare
itself
would
scurry
away
before
her
up
one
of
the
peat
ditches
rising
to
the
moor
level
as
soon
as
he
thought
he
was
out
of
gunshot
and
sitting
up
on
his
haunches
to
watch
now
and
again
an
old
grouse
his
head
and
hackles
red
as
a
berry
in
the
sunlight
would
rise
crow
and
swing
away
over
the
brow
of
the
moor
and
presently
from
behind
heleval
came
drifting
a
gray
bird
with
a
long
bill
who
on
hovering
wings
wheeled
three
times
in
the
air
above
her
and
gave
his
full
spring
call
the
most
wonderful
sound
that
the
hills
ever
hear
then
he
stooped
close
over
her
head
and
with
wings
spread
shot
away
for
the
sea
one
may
see
a
curlew
on
the
moor
in
october
but
he
will
not
give
his
spring
call
and
fiona
felt
of
good
courage
for
she
knew
that
the
bird
had
called
for
her
to
tell
her
she
was
in
the
right
way
so
she
came
to
the
foot
of
heleval
itself
and
started
to
climb
the
steep
slope
of
short
grass
slippery
as
polished
board
which
led
up
to
the
rock
pinnacle
above
the
hillside
twinkled
with
the
white
scuts
of
rabbits
racing
up
before
her
to
their
holes
as
round
the
side
of
the
mountain
came
their
enemy
perhaps
the
last
kite
in
the
island
glittering
in
the
sun
as
only
a
glede
can
till
the
beautiful
cowardly
creature
caught
sight
of
fiona
and
swept
away
across
the
valley
she
passed
the
great
cairn
where
the
hill
foxes
live
and
began
the
last
climb
to
the
pinnacle
of
rock
that
fronts
the
flat
crest
of
the
mountain
and
now
something
white
on
the
rock
which
she
had
noticed
from
below
without
taking
account
of
began
to
become
insistent
it
could
not
possibly
be
a
patch
of
snow
yet
she
thought
perhaps
the
shepherd
had
hung
a
sheepskin
there
but
no
sheepskin
was
ever
so
white
then
she
came
up
near
the
pinnacle
and
saw
standing
upright
against
it
was
a
girl
not
much
older
than
herself
her
long
dark
hair
blew
back
over
the
rock
her
white
body
was
half
hidden
in
a
trembling
veil
of
white
light
which
shimmered
and
played
all
about
her
waving
with
every
breath
of
the
wind
her
face
was
beautiful
and
cold
like
a
frosty
moonrise
her
eyes
shone
like
the
drip
of
phosphorescent
water
under
the
stars
you
have
come
at
last
said
the
girl
every
day
for
many
days
i
have
watched
for
you
who
are
you
you
beautiful
girl
asked
fiona
i
am
an
oread
said
the
girl
i
am
the
spirit
of
heleval
i
have
heard
said
fiona
that
long
ago
people
used
to
believe
that
everything
had
a
spirit
of
its
own
mountains
and
rivers
and
trees
is
it
true
then
it
true
said
the
girl
the
world
was
full
of
my
sisters
once
there
were
the
naiads
in
the
streams
and
the
hamadryads
in
the
woods
and
we
the
oreads
in
the
mountains
men
were
wiser
and
simpler
in
those
days
but
now
my
sisters
are
nearly
all
gone
when
a
tree
has
become
so
many
cubic
feet
of
timber
how
can
it
shelter
a
dryad
when
a
stream
is
merely
so
many
units
of
waterpower
how
can
a
naiad
dwell
there
only
the
barren
mountains
if
they
contain
neither
gold
nor
iron
have
been
left
unappraised
and
unexploited
and
a
few
oreads
still
linger
here
and
there
once
in
a
while
a
man
fancies
that
he
sees
one
of
us
then
he
must
climb
and
climb
till
the
day
he
dies
hoping
to
see
her
indeed
down
in
your
world
people
call
him
mountain
mad
how
is
it
then
that
i
have
seen
you
asked
fiona
the
oread
touched
her
bracelet
partly
because
of
this
she
said
but
chiefly
because
you
are
a
child
and
can
still
see
what
is
it
you
have
come
to
ask
me
how
to
find
the
urchin
said
fiona
you
know
of
course
where
he
is
the
girl
asked
and
fiona
said
yes
he
is
in
fairyland
but
i
do
not
know
the
way
to
go
that
is
easily
told
said
the
oread
the
king
of
the
woodcock
will
let
you
in
and
any
of
his
people
can
tell
you
where
to
find
him
but
do
you
know
the
danger
if
you
do
arrive
which
is
very
doubtful
the
fairies
will
make
you
wish
a
wish
and
if
your
wish
be
one
that
does
not
find
favor
with
them
they
will
keep
you
there
forever
till
you
lose
your
memory
and
yourself
and
become
even
as
one
of
them
i
will
take
the
risk
said
fiona
for
i
must
go
and
try
to
bring
him
back
why
do
you
want
to
bring
him
back
asked
the
oread
he
is
much
better
where
he
is
will
he
thank
you
for
bringing
him
back
not
a
bit
you
will
have
the
labor
and
the
danger
and
he
will
take
it
all
for
granted
and
then
he
will
become
a
man
and
what
use
is
that
he
may
be
a
financier
and
cheat
somebody
or
a
politician
and
slander
somebody
or
a
learned
man
and
hinder
wisdom
he
is
much
better
in
fairyland
why
are
you
going
i
ca
help
it
said
fiona
you
ca
leave
people
in
the
lurch
you
know
of
course
you
can
said
the
oread
be
sensible
and
go
home
eat
drink
and
be
merry
o
do
you
understand
said
fiona
do
you
see
that
there
are
some
things
you
do
whatever
anybody
says
it
not
the
reason
of
the
thing
it
only
just
because
i
am
i
and
he
is
lost
you
are
so
beautiful
have
you
any
heart
neither
heart
nor
soul
said
the
oread
so
i
ought
to
be
perfectly
happy
you
have
a
heart
and
a
soul
and
you
are
not
which
of
us
is
the
better
off
i
would
change
anyhow
said
fiona
the
oread
laughed
of
course
you
would
it
is
i
who
would
change
if
i
could
but
as
i
have
no
soul
and
can
not
get
one
and
do
not
know
what
it
would
mean
to
get
one
it
is
no
use
worrying
it
is
best
to
be
happy
as
i
am
in
any
case
i
would
not
care
to
be
like
men
and
women
i
would
not
mind
having
a
child
heart
like
you
i
had
a
heart
once
but
it
is
so
long
ago
that
i
have
almost
forgotten
what
it
was
like
how
old
do
you
think
i
am
you
about
seventeen
said
fiona
i
am
exactly
as
old
as
heleval
said
the
girl
and
that
is
more
hundreds
of
thousands
of
years
than
you
or
i
could
ever
count
i
am
older
than
any
of
the
fishes
or
birds
or
beasts
far
older
than
men
or
fairies
look
at
that
and
the
oread
swept
her
arm
over
the
glorious
prospect
around
her
the
two
great
wings
of
the
isle
of
mist
stretched
far
out
into
the
sea
the
atlantic
throbbing
and
sparkling
under
the
blue
sky
and
across
the
loch
the
jagged
gray
range
of
the
cuchullins
peak
upon
peak
is
it
all
beautiful
we
came
into
being
together
heleval
was
a
giant
in
those
days
a
king
among
other
kings
and
there
was
no
sea
there
and
the
cuchullin
hills
stood
right
up
into
the
sky
and
twisted
and
bubbled
while
the
earth
cooled
and
cracked
and
my
sisters
of
the
fire
came
out
of
the
cracks
and
taught
us
mountain
spirits
the
fire
dance
and
we
danced
it
all
night
on
the
great
peaks
till
the
stars
reeled
to
watch
us
and
then
the
fiery
summits
cooled
and
sank
down
and
my
sisters
of
the
fire
sank
with
them
and
a
mighty
river
went
foaming
out
down
the
valley
yonder
to
a
distant
sea
and
every
evening
my
sisters
the
naiads
came
floating
up
in
a
circle
with
garlands
of
green
on
their
hair
and
they
taught
us
mountain
spirits
the
water
dance
and
we
danced
it
all
night
on
the
moonlit
water
while
the
ocean
crept
nearer
and
nearer
to
gaze
and
then
the
sea
came
up
and
the
river
carved
heleval
out
as
you
see
it
and
shrank
away
and
my
sisters
the
naiads
shrank
away
with
it
and
the
island
was
covered
with
great
forests
and
my
sisters
the
hamadryads
came
out
of
the
and
taught
us
mountain
spirits
the
tree
dance
and
we
danced
it
all
night
in
the
forest
glades
till
one
night
men
saw
and
men
felled
the
forests
to
capture
my
sisters
of
the
trees
and
enslave
them
but
they
vanished
as
the
trees
vanished
and
only
the
hills
are
left
and
we
the
oreads
a
people
few
and
fading
away
and
we
no
longer
dance
for
we
have
lost
all
our
sisters
and
we
no
longer
have
hearts
the
girl
face
had
filled
with
color
as
she
spoke
and
her
eyes
had
become
soft
and
her
voice
sounded
like
the
music
of
waters
far
away
fiona
looked
at
her
in
wonder
indeed
indeed
you
have
your
heart
still
she
said
and
you
are
far
more
beautiful
even
than
i
thought
you
were
come
home
with
me
and
i
will
love
you
as
you
loved
your
sisters
it
is
not
possible
said
the
oread
it
is
not
free
to
me
to
leave
heleval
i
heleval
and
i
shall
be
here
till
one
day
men
find
iron
or
copper
in
my
mountain
and
come
up
with
great
engines
to
carve
it
and
tear
its
flanks
and
carry
it
away
and
then
i
shall
go
too
as
my
sisters
have
gone
will
you
die
asked
fiona
i
do
not
know
what
death
means
said
the
girl
i
shall
just
go
back
like
a
drop
of
water
when
it
falls
into
the
sea
but
do
you
know
what
you
have
done
for
a
few
moments
because
you
are
brave
and
loyal
you
have
given
me
back
my
heart
which
was
lost
thousands
of
years
ago
it
will
all
fade
away
again
but
before
it
fades
will
you
kiss
me
so
fiona
took
her
in
her
arms
and
kissed
her
and
then
turned
and
went
down
the
hill
once
she
faced
round
and
saw
the
oread
standing
frosty
and
white
against
the
pinnacle
of
rock
holding
out
her
arms
and
she
started
to
go
back
to
her
and
even
as
she
moved
the
whiteness
vanished
and
there
was
nothing
there
but
the
rocky
pinnacle
shining
in
the
slanting
sunlight
rather
sadly
she
went
home
chapter
vi
the
king
of
the
woodcock
that
night
fiona
told
her
father
that
she
believed
she
had
found
the
way
to
go
they
also
discussed
the
question
of
catching
a
woodcock
with
the
result
that
fiona
was
up
at
dawn
and
off
to
the
kennels
behind
the
big
house
where
the
urchin
father
kept
his
dogs
she
understood
that
she
must
take
advantage
both
of
the
night
frost
and
the
habits
of
the
keeper
who
was
apt
to
lie
in
bed
awhile
when
no
one
was
about
the
two
setters
stood
on
their
hind
legs
to
greet
her
and
pawed
at
the
bars
whining
and
dancing
with
joy
artemis
was
white
and
brown
and
apollo
was
white
and
black
fiona
threw
open
the
door
and
they
were
out
in
a
moment
tumbling
over
each
other
as
they
made
wild
rings
round
the
grass
and
dashing
back
in
between
to
lick
her
hand
she
had
to
sit
down
and
wait
till
the
first
exuberance
was
over
and
they
came
and
lay
down
at
her
feet
with
their
tongues
out
it
is
good
to
be
out
so
early
said
apollo
it
so
slow
in
the
kennel
said
artemis
and
we
ca
even
talk
to
each
other
because
apollo
was
broken
in
english
and
does
know
any
gaelic
and
i
was
broken
by
another
man
in
gaelic
and
do
know
any
english
you
interpret
wo
you
said
apollo
of
course
we
the
international
code
but
it
does
take
one
much
further
than
the
passwords
so
for
the
rest
of
the
morning
fiona
had
not
only
to
interpret
but
to
make
every
remark
twice
over
once
in
each
language
but
it
will
do
if
the
reader
takes
this
for
granted
what
are
we
going
to
do
asked
apollo
so
fiona
explained
to
them
that
she
wanted
to
catch
a
woodcock
and
ask
him
a
question
and
she
hoped
they
would
help
her
of
course
we
will
said
artemis
we
know
all
about
woodcock
when
we
go
out
with
himself
we
find
them
for
him
and
stand
still
and
then
he
makes
a
noise
and
they
fall
down
dead
sometimes
said
apollo
generally
corrected
artemis
loyally
will
you
make
them
fall
down
dead
fiona
explained
that
she
only
wanted
to
catch
one
and
talk
to
it
we
never
saw
that
done
said
apollo
but
we
will
find
one
and
then
you
can
catch
it
it
very
early
for
woodcock
said
artemis
there
wo
be
any
in
the
heather
on
the
second
of
october
but
there
may
be
an
early
pair
in
the
ferns
the
first
ones
always
pitch
in
the
ferns
on
glenollisdal
said
apollo
so
to
glenollisdal
they
went
down
the
shore
road
and
across
the
little
bridge
and
then
by
the
shepherd
track
along
the
top
of
the
black
cliffs
over
grass
and
stones
all
rough
and
white
with
the
frost
the
cold
morning
air
was
like
new
wine
and
fiona
had
to
shade
her
eyes
from
the
low
sun
then
the
track
left
the
cliffs
and
began
to
climb
up
a
sunless
valley
across
little
burns
beautiful
with
fading
ferns
till
between
two
great
moorland
crags
it
reached
the
pass
more
a
watercourse
now
than
a
track
and
then
came
the
cairn
at
the
summit
of
the
pass
with
its
glorious
view
of
sea
and
mountain
and
down
at
one
very
feet
the
deep
narrow
valley
that
was
glenollisdal
seamed
from
crest
to
foot
by
its
deep
burn
which
ran
half
its
length
through
faded
brown
heather
and
then
out
to
sea
through
a
huge
bed
of
dying
bracken
the
whole
bathed
in
the
bright
morning
sun
we
always
come
here
the
first
day
said
apollo
oh
we
are
going
to
have
fun
the
three
followed
the
track
down
to
where
it
passed
the
top
of
the
fern
bed
there
was
a
good
deal
of
grass
there
dotted
with
sheep
and
in
one
place
looking
well
out
to
sea
a
curious
little
hard
circle
in
the
grass
where
no
sheep
ever
came
that
is
the
fairy
ring
said
artemis
where
they
dance
you
know
they
dance
on
all
hallows
said
apollo
but
no
one
ever
sees
them
because
everyone
afraid
to
go
and
look
said
artemis
please
may
we
start
said
apollo
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
wait
till
we
point
said
artemis
and
then
come
to
us
and
the
two
dogs
dashed
off
into
the
great
fern
bed
crossing
each
other
backwards
and
forwards
like
a
pair
of
scissors
as
they
quartered
it
they
were
not
long
about
it
apollo
gallop
became
a
sort
of
run
a
yard
or
two
of
stealthy
crawl
and
he
stopped
dead
tail
stiff
and
throat
distended
like
a
dog
of
marble
and
looked
round
for
fiona
artemis
was
just
crossing
him
she
whipped
round
in
her
stride
as
if
shot
and
became
a
second
marble
image
where
she
stood
fiona
walked
down
to
apollo
but
the
ferns
rustled
a
good
deal
as
she
made
her
way
through
and
as
she
reached
the
dog
side
the
cock
rose
five
yards
away
with
a
lazy
careless
flap
as
if
it
felt
only
the
bother
of
being
disturbed
for
a
moment
she
had
a
vivid
impression
of
the
white
patches
at
the
end
of
its
fan
of
tail
feathers
and
then
it
gradually
gathered
speed
and
swept
away
over
the
side
of
the
valley
for
an
instant
it
showed
black
as
it
crossed
the
sky
line
and
then
it
was
gone
apollo
turned
to
fiona
with
unhappy
eyes
and
licked
her
hand
but
artemis
never
moved
a
muscle
come
to
me
she
said
in
a
low
whisper
very
quietly
fiona
reached
her
side
the
other
bird
is
here
whispered
artemis
just
under
my
nose
stoop
down
fiona
bent
down
between
the
stalks
of
the
bracken
the
woodcock
was
sitting
with
its
back
to
her
a
little
brown
bunch
of
feathers
very
gently
she
put
her
hand
out
and
even
as
she
did
so
she
became
aware
of
a
wise
black
eye
looking
at
her
though
the
bird
faced
the
other
way
her
hand
closed
on
the
empty
air
and
the
woodcock
with
a
wonderful
spring
was
well
on
its
way
to
seek
its
mate
i
believe
i
could
have
put
a
foot
on
it
said
artemis
regretfully
but
of
course
we
are
not
allowed
to
i
do
know
how
i
came
to
be
so
foolish
said
fiona
i
ought
to
have
spoken
to
it
instead
of
trying
to
catch
it
but
i
forgot
better
luck
next
time
said
apollo
we
must
try
again
but
though
the
dogs
worked
the
whole
of
the
ferns
carefully
there
was
no
other
bird
there
they
came
back
and
lay
down
beside
fiona
tongues
out
and
panting
it
no
use
trying
the
heather
yet
i
know
said
artemis
birds
are
never
in
it
at
this
time
of
year
there
are
some
more
ferns
two
miles
on
said
apollo
doubtfully
i
saw
a
bird
there
once
three
years
ago
i
wish
i
knew
what
to
do
said
fiona
we
can
leave
it
for
a
day
or
two
and
come
back
said
artemis
those
two
birds
will
be
back
again
to
look
for
each
other
but
they
wo
be
so
confiding
again
added
apollo
they
were
all
so
preoccupied
that
they
never
noticed
the
shepherd
till
he
was
quite
close
to
them
he
was
striding
down
the
track
a
big
man
with
red
hair
a
plaid
was
thrown
loosely
across
his
shoulder
at
his
heels
followed
a
jet
black
collie
the
dogs
saw
him
first
it
would
seem
that
they
did
not
like
him
every
hair
on
their
necks
bristled
they
shrank
close
to
fiona
making
little
moaning
noises
in
their
throats
and
flattening
themselves
as
if
they
were
trying
to
burrow
into
the
ground
their
eyes
were
full
of
terror
why
artemis
apollo
what
the
matter
said
fiona
then
she
looked
up
and
saw
the
shepherd
why
it
only
the
new
shepherd
and
his
collie
there
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
collie
said
apollo
that
thing
not
a
collie
ca
you
see
shepherd
echoed
artemis
that
thing
not
a
shepherd
oh
you
see
the
shepherd
came
up
to
fiona
and
said
that
miss
fiona
was
out
early
and
was
there
anything
he
could
be
doing
for
her
he
spoke
in
the
soft
correct
english
of
the
gael
i
came
out
to
catch
a
woodcock
to
talk
to
it
said
fiona
and
we
ca
catch
one
it
occurred
to
her
even
as
she
spoke
that
the
statement
sounded
a
little
out
of
the
ordinary
but
the
rough
shepherd
never
let
the
least
sign
of
this
show
on
his
face
he
answered
in
the
most
way
with
the
gentle
courtesy
of
the
west
coast
that
there
would
not
be
many
woodcock
in
yet
and
would
he
try
to
catch
one
for
miss
fiona
oh
do
you
think
you
could
said
fiona
eagerly
i
should
be
so
grateful
then
the
shepherd
saw
the
trouble
of
the
dogs
he
said
something
to
them
in
a
language
that
was
neither
english
nor
gaelic
and
waved
his
own
dog
to
go
the
collie
went
straight
off
up
the
moor
and
sat
down
on
the
top
of
the
nearest
rock
ledge
an
odd
little
blot
of
black
on
the
brown
and
yellow
moorland
apollo
and
artemis
got
up
and
shook
themselves
violently
it
was
the
international
password
said
apollo
goodness
knows
where
he
got
it
from
but
we
have
to
recognize
it
i
not
happy
said
artemis
i
was
well
brought
up
i
never
associated
with
this
sort
of
thing
before
fiona
who
knew
that
a
new
shepherd
had
been
coming
could
make
nothing
of
their
trouble
and
did
her
best
to
smooth
them
down
the
shepherd
led
the
way
up
the
hill
and
on
to
a
little
rough
plateau
broken
with
rocks
and
bits
of
heather
lying
under
the
main
rise
of
the
hill
where
it
rounds
away
toward
the
glenollisdal
burn
i
am
thinking
that
there
should
be
a
woodcock
about
here
he
said
this
is
one
of
the
earliest
places
in
all
the
heather
whispered
artemis
to
fiona
he
must
know
this
moor
very
well
it
too
early
yet
all
the
same
even
for
here
said
apollo
it
looked
as
if
apollo
were
right
for
when
at
the
shepherd
request
fiona
threw
the
dogs
off
they
quartered
the
whole
plateau
and
found
nothing
but
the
shepherd
stuck
to
his
guns
i
am
thinking
that
there
should
be
a
bird
here
he
said
will
miss
fiona
give
me
leave
to
try
my
own
dog
fiona
nodded
and
called
the
setters
to
heel
the
shepherd
waved
his
hand
and
the
black
collie
came
racing
to
him
some
collies
will
work
a
ground
like
a
spaniel
and
some
will
even
do
a
little
pointing
but
the
black
collie
troubled
himself
neither
with
one
nor
the
other
when
the
shepherd
spoke
to
him
he
just
cantered
straight
forward
to
a
small
patch
of
heather
on
the
sunless
side
of
a
rock
where
the
frost
still
lingered
and
there
sat
down
quite
unconcerned
as
though
the
matter
in
hand
were
altogether
beneath
the
scope
of
his
talents
i
think
he
has
a
bird
said
the
shepherd
i
tried
that
place
said
apollo
there
nothing
there
but
the
shepherd
had
gone
up
to
his
dog
and
was
peering
carefully
into
the
heather
then
he
beckoned
fiona
does
miss
fiona
see
the
bird
he
asked
pointing
fiona
looked
long
before
she
saw
the
woodcock
had
squeezed
himself
right
into
the
roots
of
a
clump
of
heather
and
even
when
the
heather
was
parted
nothing
showed
but
his
little
orange
tail
with
its
white
and
black
points
shall
i
catch
him
for
miss
fiona
asked
the
shepherd
and
fiona
said
oh
yes
please
if
you
will
the
shepherd
knelt
down
and
brought
his
two
great
hands
slowly
to
either
side
of
the
tuft
of
heather
then
he
closed
them
with
a
snap
and
drew
out
the
largest
woodcock
fiona
had
ever
seen
it
struggled
and
thrashed
at
his
wrists
with
its
powerful
wings
will
miss
fiona
take
the
bird
now
he
said
just
behind
the
wings
with
her
thumbs
on
its
back
so
fiona
took
her
bird
and
as
she
did
so
its
eye
caught
the
glint
of
her
copper
bangle
it
stopped
thrashing
with
its
wings
and
lay
quite
still
in
her
hands
oh
i
say
he
said
why
did
you
say
before
instead
of
employing
these
people
and
frightening
an
honest
bird
out
of
his
senses
my
dogs
could
find
you
said
fiona
and
i
think
it
was
so
good
of
the
shepherd
to
find
you
for
me
shepherd
said
the
woodcock
that
was
a
shepherd
and
it
a
collie
either
fiona
suddenly
recollected
that
she
had
not
yet
thanked
the
shepherd
and
turned
to
do
so
but
the
shepherd
and
collie
were
gone
they
must
have
walked
very
quickly
to
have
turned
the
corner
of
the
hill
already
where
did
he
go
she
asked
artemis
artemis
shivered
to
his
own
place
i
hope
said
artemis
severely
well
brought
up
dogs
should
not
be
asked
to
associate
with
things
like
that
but
it
was
only
the
new
shepherd
said
fiona
there
the
new
shepherd
said
artemis
nodding
toward
a
distant
slope
where
a
figure
with
a
brown
collie
could
be
seen
gathering
sheep
what
were
they
then
asked
fiona
two
of
the
little
people
of
course
said
apollo
oh
dear
oh
dear
i
afraid
you
have
trouble
one
generally
dies
said
artemis
with
cheerful
consolation
but
they
were
very
nice
to
me
indeed
said
fiona
of
course
they
were
said
the
woodcock
you
privileged
you
know
all
know
it
and
do
you
mind
the
dogs
my
dear
they
are
good
creatures
but
they
and
their
forbears
have
lived
so
long
with
humans
that
they
have
forgotten
most
of
the
things
we
know
they
are
nearly
as
blind
as
humans
now
saving
your
presence
my
dear
and
now
what
is
it
you
want
with
me
i
want
to
find
the
king
of
the
woodcock
said
fiona
bless
your
heart
said
the
bird
and
who
do
you
suppose
we
are
you
never
saw
a
woodcock
our
size
before
did
you
and
indeed
fiona
never
had
for
he
was
as
big
as
a
young
grouse
eighteen
and
a
half
ounces
if
i
a
pennyweight
said
the
woodcock
i
am
the
heaviest
king
that
we
have
ever
had
will
you
please
put
me
down
if
you
want
to
talk
to
me
it
is
hardly
consonant
with
my
royal
dignity
to
be
held
i
sha
fly
away
you
know
so
fiona
put
him
down
and
he
arranged
himself
like
a
bunch
of
feathers
on
the
ground
his
head
well
back
between
his
shoulders
and
his
beady
black
eyes
looking
all
round
him
at
once
why
did
apollo
find
you
asked
fiona
no
scent
said
the
woodcock
proudly
i
am
not
like
a
common
bird
no
dog
can
find
a
king
woodcock
and
no
dog
ever
has
we
can
be
beaten
out
of
a
wood
of
course
my
was
shot
like
that
when
the
family
lived
in
norfolk
many
years
ago
so
we
came
up
here
to
the
open
heather
and
have
been
quite
safe
ever
since
and
now
what
do
you
want
my
dear
i
was
told
you
could
let
me
into
fairyland
said
fiona
i
can
let
you
in
by
the
back
door
the
bird
said
but
are
you
really
going
to
fairyland
you
need
some
courage
you
know
if
you
are
going
the
back
way
is
there
another
way
asked
fiona
there
the
front
door
of
course
said
the
bird
but
no
one
can
go
that
way
without
an
invitation
have
you
an
invitation
no
said
fiona
a
pity
said
the
woodcock
there
is
no
danger
that
way
but
without
an
invitation
you
could
not
even
find
the
door
as
it
is
you
have
to
go
in
by
the
back
way
and
take
your
risks
i
have
to
go
whatever
they
are
said
fiona
said
the
woodcock
quite
so
quite
so
have
you
been
told
about
the
wish
yes
said
fiona
i
know
about
that
the
other
thing
continued
the
bird
is
that
you
must
stick
to
the
main
path
remember
that
you
must
not
turn
out
of
it
for
any
reason
of
any
kind
you
see
lots
of
side
paths
and
you
see
other
things
too
but
if
you
once
leave
the
main
path
by
so
much
as
one
step
you
never
get
home
again
there
are
no
short
cuts
to
fairyland
thank
you
so
much
said
fiona
but
how
shall
i
know
the
main
path
with
his
long
bill
the
woodcock
tweaked
the
point
feather
out
of
one
of
his
wings
and
gave
it
to
her
this
will
take
you
through
he
said
it
will
point
the
right
way
for
you
that
why
it
is
called
the
point
feather
just
follow
it
if
you
are
frightened
and
want
to
leave
your
search
and
come
home
tap
on
the
ground
with
it
and
you
will
be
back
in
glenollisdal
but
somehow
i
do
think
you
will
and
whatever
you
do
do
lose
it
when
you
reach
the
fairy
grove
show
it
to
the
guardian
and
he
will
let
you
in
and
mind
you
do
go
in
unless
he
shows
you
its
fellow
oh
all
right
thank
you
i
have
grown
others
long
before
they
are
needed
there
is
no
great
rush
to
fairyland
on
the
part
of
people
who
have
to
go
my
dear
it
all
sounds
so
much
more
difficult
than
i
thought
said
poor
fiona
nothing
worth
while
is
ever
easy
said
the
woodcock
and
now
show
you
where
to
start

the
bye

that
black

somewhere

bother
about
us
said
apollo
we
be
home
long
before
the
keeper
is
out
of
bed
so
fiona
took
a
warm
farewell
of
the
two
dogs
who
lamented
her
sad
fate
and
wished
her
luck
all
in
one
breath
and
then
set
off
homeward
with
their
long
swinging
gallop
and
now
if
you
want
to
be
in
time
for
the
great
gathering
which
you
humans
call
hallow

to
hurry
said
the
woodcock
but
it
nearly
a
month
to
hallow
said
fiona
you
want
every
minute
of
it
said
the
bird
come
on
and
they
started
off
for
the
fairy
ring
the
woodcock
pattering
along
on
his
little
feet
at
a
pace
which
would
have
surprised
anyone
who
had
never
seen
a
woodcock
do
it
how
come
you
to
be
doorkeeper
asked
fiona
as
they
went
hereditary
said
the
bird
we
used
to
go
to
all
the
lost
lands
you
know
like
lyonesse
and
lemuria
and
bresil
and
atlantis
we
still
cross
ireland
once
a
year
and
pass
on
into
the
atlantic
to
salute
the
site
of
plato
island
before
we
settle
in
britain
and
fairyland
is
only
another
of
the
lost
lands
here
we
are
they
had
come
to
the
fairy
ring
there
nothing
more
i
can
do
now
said
the
woodcock
a
straight
step
and
a
stout
heart
my
dear
fiona
took
the
feather
in
her
hand
and
stood
in
the
fairy
ring
chapter
vii
fiona
in
the
it
was
very
very
dark
fiona
could
not
see
her
hand
if
she
held
it
close
before
her
eyes
it
was
just
blackness
only
one
thing
broke
it
far
away
many
miles
it
might
be
was
a
tiny
speck
of
white
like
the
point
of
a
pin
all
round
her
in
the
dark
were
little
soft
sounds
they
brushed
against
her
feet
and
passed
before
her
face
little
soft
sounds
apparently
without
bodies
she
held
the
tiny
firmly
in
the
fingers
of
her
left
hand
and
touched
it
from
time
to
time
with
her
right
as
she
felt
her
way
one
foot
before
the
other
she
could
not
walk
towards
the
point
of
light
and
with
her
and
about
her
went
the
small
soft
sounds
one
would
have
said
that
they
whispered
and
chuckled
in
the
darkness
how
far
and
how
long
she
went
she
could
never
guess
there
was
nothing
by
which
to
measure
time
or
distance
and
evidently
she
was
not
going
to
feel
hunger
or
fatigue
at
last
she
became
conscious
of
a
change
the
white
speck
of
light
was
growing
brighter
and
larger
and
the
small
soft
sounds
were
becoming
tangible
one
brushed
past
her
face
and
she
felt
it
she
put
out
a
hand
and
there
was
a
scuffing
and
chuckling
as
if
they
were
playing
blind
man
buff
with
her
then
the
light
began
to
take
shape
it
was
a
circular
pool
lying
on
the
floor
and
wall
of
the
avenue
of
blackness
down
which
she
was
passing
and
it
came
from
something
on
the
other
side
and
the
little
soft
sounds
crowded
round
her
they
laughed
they
whispered
they
clutched
at
her
dress
they
were
trying
to
guide
her
in
a
certain
direction
she
tried
to
shake
them
off
and
found
that
though
they
could
touch
her
she
could
not
touch
them
and
then
she
came
into
the
pool
of
light
the
light
came
down
a
sort
of
short
passage
between
rocks
with
a
floor
and
at
the
end
of
it
not
twenty
yards
from
where
she
stood
she
could
see
the
fairy
grotto
one
grand
white
carbuncle
as
big
as
an
arc
lamp
hung
from
the
roof
filling
the
grotto
with
dazzling
white
light
and
the
radiance
of
the
carbuncle
was
flung
back
in
a
million
points
of
new
splendor
from
the
walls
of
the
grotto
shifting
and
shimmering
like
the
rainbow
across
a
waterfall
ruby
and
orange
yellow
and
emerald
sapphire
and
violet
changing
as
each
new
facet
came
into
play
for
the
walls
of
the
grotto
were
set
thick
with
cut
jewels
of
every
hue
and
color
a
glorious
sight
it
looked
and
fiona
suddenly
became
aware
that
the
soft
things
that
clutched
at
her
dress
and
the
soft
things
that
whispered
in
her
ear
were
all
trying
to
draw
her
toward
the
beautiful
grotto
but
she
felt
her
feather
and
it
pointed
straight
on
into
the
dark
so
she
moved
forward
and
with
the
first
step
she
saw
the
trap
the
floor
of
the
beautiful
grotto
yawned
wide
showing
the
horrible
abyss
beneath
it
and
the
darkness
was
full
of
soft
flutterings
and
the
chuckling
of
mocking
laughter
but
they
touched
her
no
more
at
the
time
and
suddenly
the
darkness
fell
away
on
each
side
like
a
wall
and
she
stepped
out
into
daylight
she
was
in
the
desert
the
yellow
burning
sand
stretched
all
round
her
a
mass
of
glittering
particles
that
made
the
eyes
sore
wave
after
wave
it
went
billowing
away
to
the
red
burning
hills
that
faced
and
flung
back
the
burning
sun
mile
after
mile
she
stumbled
along
in
that
aching
heat
and
then
as
she
topped
a
great
hillock
of
sand
she
suddenly
saw
the
fairy
city
very
beautiful
it
looked
on
a
wooded
island
in
a
fair
lake
of
water
whose
blue
mirror
gave
back
every
trembling
cupola
and
minaret
and
toward
it
down
a
broad
track
marked
by
tamarisk
bushes
went
a
goodly
company
of
merchants
with
tinkling
bells
on
their
camels
necks
and
golden
ornaments
on
their
camels
heads
the
company
of
a
chief
who
rode
ahead
on
a
white
arab
steed
with
his
long
jezail
laid
across
his
here
could
no
doubt
be
and
fiona
all
but
stepped
on
to
the
broad
path
in
the
track
of
the
caravan
but
even
as
she
turned
she
caught
sight
of
the
feather
and
checked
herself
just
in
time
and
the
beautiful
city
of
mirage
melted
away
and
there
was
no
caravan
there
but
only
sand
marked
by
the
bones
of
men
and
in
place
of
the
tamarisk
bushes
were
gray
vultures
feasting
in
a
row
she
followed
the
feather
straight
on
across
the
burning
desert
and
on
a
sudden
she
walked
out
of
the
sand
into
shade
she
was
out
in
the
forest
huge
trees
rose
like
the
pillars
of
a
cathedral
nave
branching
far
above
her
head
and
shutting
out
the
daylight
and
up
their
trunks
ran
starred
creepers
of
every
hue
fighting
their
way
up
to
the
sun
down
from
the
branches
hung
orchids
of
all
fantastic
shapes
in
long
still
streamers
and
great
moon
moths
fluttered
round
them
taking
their
joy
in
the
dim
light
and
the
farther
she
went
the
thicker
grew
the
forest
and
the
more
oppressive
the
airless
heat
trailing
plants
ran
across
her
feet
and
tried
to
trip
her
up
the
great
trunks
closed
together
till
there
was
barely
room
to
force
a
way
between
the
thorns
of
the
creepers
tore
at
her
flesh
and
instead
of
the
beautiful
orchids
there
came
on
the
trees
huge
funguses
red
as
blood
and
the
small
soft
voices
began
again
they
had
caught
her
up
the
forest
was
full
of
the
same
little
sounds
which
she
had
heard
before
whispering
and
chuckling
and
fingering
her
dress
and
then
just
as
it
seemed
impossible
to
fight
a
way
farther
through
the
dense
jungle
she
came
to
the
open
glade
full
of
grass
and
flowers
and
sunshine
it
was
and
across
it
ran
a
gurgling
brook
crossed
by
a
little
plank
bridge
a
sweet
breeze
moved
the
grass
and
beyond
the
brook
two
little
spotted
deer
were
feeding
far
in
the
distance
were
tiny
peaks
of
snow
the
soft
fingers
were
all
tugging
at
fiona
dress
impelling
her
down
the
glade
but
she
had
had
ample
warning
of
those
soft
fingers
and
she
saw
that
the
feather
pointed
straight
on
through
the
tangled
forest
and
even
as
she
moved
she
saw
that
the
little
bridge
was
the
back
of
a
great
and
the
fingers
loosed
their
hold
of
her
dress
and
the
air
was
full
of
soft
whisperings
and
laughter
and
she
walked
straight
on
into
the
tangled
thicket
before
her
and
the
forest
parted
to
right
and
left
and
she
walked
out
she
was
in
a
fair
country
of
green
grass
and
temperate
airs
where
the
path
lay
true
and
straight
before
her
through
vineyards
and
groves
of
oranges
here
and
there
a
cherry
tree
swung
its
crown
of
white
blossom
above
her
head
or
a
cypress
stood
up
tall
and
straight
as
a
sentinel
on
duty
purple
flags
bloomed
under
the
rocks
and
on
a
clump
of
brown
orchises
sat
two
little
jewelled
butterflies
burnished
green
as
old
copper
up
the
path
of
the
sunlight
came
a
swallowtail
with
its
stately
glancing
flight
everything
spoke
to
her
here
of
fair
peace
and
security
and
when
she
heard
the
air
still
rustling
with
little
soft
sounds
and
chuckles
and
knew
that
they
had
followed
her
she
began
to
wonder
how
it
was
that
now
that
she
knew
their
ways
they
should
think
it
worth
while
and
they
were
becoming
most
active
the
soft
sounds
brushed
all
round
her
the
soft
fingers
grasped
her
arms
tiny
weightless
bodies
behind
her
seemed
to
be
impelling
her
forward
and
then
before
her
she
saw
the
inevitable
two
paths
the
broad
flat
path
that
passed
through
a
fair
orchard
of
lemon
trees
where
the
sunlight
threw
chequers
on
to
the
grass
beneath
starred
with
scarlet
and
purple
anemones
and
the
narrow
stony
track
terribly
steep
which
toiled
away
up
the
bare
hillside
in
heat
radiated
from
the
rocks
never
had
the
soft
sounds
been
so
insistent
a
myriad
gentle
hands
were
trying
to
steer
her
even
to
push
her
by
force
toward
the
lemon
trees
she
saw
the
folly
of
them
so
very
clearly
and
her
foot
was
actually
raised
to
take
the
first
step
up
the
hill
path
when
she
felt
the
feather
turn
of
itself
in
her
hand
and
she
became
ice
from
head
to
foot
as
she
realized
that
she
had
all
but
destroyed
herself
by
despising
her
opponents
they
had
striven
this
time
to
force
her
into
the
path
believing
that
she
would
certainly
take
the
opposite
one
she
saw
now
the
end
of
the
fatal
hill
path
the
sudden
crumbling
precipice
which
flung
men
on
to
pointed
rocks
far
below
and
the
air
behind
her
became
full
of
woe
voiceless
wailings
and
silent
howls
of
rage
and
she
saw
what
she
had
fought
against
a
troop
of
small
formless
black
things
like
immature
bats
with
pale
fingers
that
fled
moaning
down
the
path
of
the
sunlight
she
knew
now
that
they
would
not
vex
her
again
she
passed
on
through
the
lemon
orchard
and
out
on
to
a
bare
hillside
rough
with
stones
and
dotted
here
and
there
with
great
oak
trees
plants
of
asphodel
were
thrusting
their
blossoms
up
among
the
coarse
tufts
of
grass
and
far
below
in
all
its
laughing
splendor
lay
the
sea
and
as
she
turned
the
shoulder
of
the
hill
she
saw
the
temple
a
fair
doric
temple
of
gray
marble
standing
in
lonely
beauty
among
the
scattered
oak
trees
its
metopes
were
carved
with
the
figures
of
gods
and
heroes
of
an
older
day
and
round
it
ran
a
frieze
of
warriors
who
fought
with
amazon
women
the
singing
was
just
over
it
seemed
and
the
double
choir
of
girls
who
had
been
giving
strophe
and
antistrophe
of
some
festival
ode
had
broken
into
groups
these
playing
at
ball
those
reclining
in
the
shade
or
strolling
about
with
their
arms
round
each
other
waists
in
her
chair
in
the
cool
portico
sat
the
matronly
priestess
still
crowned
with
red
roses
and
before
her
two
little
boys
poured
wine
into
a
crystal
goblet
and
as
she
saw
fiona
she
rose
from
her
chair
and
greeted
her
by
name
calling
her
happy
that
she
had
now
come
safely
through
the
path
of
danger
and
that
her
troubles
were
ended
come
here
to
us
she
said
and
rest
for
it
is
but
a
little
way
now
that
you
must
go
and
there
is
ample
time
slake
your
thirst
at
this
crystal
goblet
and
lie
awhile
in
the
shade
while
these
maidens
crown
you
with
flowers
but
fiona
had
learnt
her
lesson
and
she
looked
at
her
feather
and
the
feather
pointed
straight
along
the
hillside
so
she
passed
on
without
a
look
or
a
word
and
as
she
passed
came
a
noise
as
of
the
earth
opening
and
the
pillars
of
the
temple
bowed
themselves
and
the
middle
of
the
building
collapsed
stone
by
stone
till
only
the
outer
columns
remained
among
a
mass
of
fallen
blocks
and
triglyph
and
metope
and
sculptured
frieze
lay
in
fragments
about
them
and
among
the
ruins
a
red
fox
with
two
cubs
sat
and
snarled
as
she
watched
a
company
of
toads
crawling
in
the
dust
and
of
that
fair
scene
all
that
had
not
changed
was
the
pallid
asphodel
the
asphodel
whose
home
is
in
those
other
meadows
where
walk
the
pallid
dead
and
as
fiona
passed
on
the
hillside
itself
dissolved
in
mist
and
there
before
her
lay
the
fairy
grove
and
the
guardian
of
the
grove
with
white
beard
sweeping
the
ground
and
old
trembling
hands
came
out
to
meet
her
and
she
showed
him
her
feather
and
from
his
belt
he
drew
out
and
held
up
its
fellow
and
she
knew
that
the
path
of
danger
was
over
no
one
has
come
through
by
the
way
you
have
come
for
more
years
than
my
old
memory
can
follow
he
said
they
always
fail
at
the
lemon
orchard
how
did
you
escape
and
fiona
told
him
how
the
feather
had
turned
in
her
hand
of
itself
the
old
man
bowed
almost
to
the
ground
that
was
the
direct
grace
of
the
king
he
said
you
must
be
a
person
of
the
greatest
consequence
and
when
fiona
said
i
am
just
an
ordinary
girl
he
again
bowed
low
and
said
young
lady
i
take
leave
to
doubt
it
then
he
gave
fiona
her
directions
for
finding
the
king
and
warned
her
that
she
must
not
loiter
in
the
fairy
grove
for
the
fairies
were
already
gathering
for
all
hallows
so
fiona
walked
swiftly
through
the
grove
not
seeing
one
half
of
its
beauties
though
she
would
have
loved
to
have
lingered
among
the
trees
for
in
the
grove
grew
every
tree
and
plant
famous
in
legend
or
in
history
of
which
not
the
tenth
part
can
be
told
here
there
was
the
norse
ash
whose
roots
bind
together
the
framework
of
the
earth
there
the
irish
hazel
of
whose
nuts
could
a
man
but
taste
he
would
know
all
knowledge
and
all
wisdom
there
the
african
pomegranate
but
for
whose
sweetness
the
would
have
disdained
to
stay
beneath
the
earth
and
the
race
of
men
would
have
perished
there
stood
deborah
terebinth
and
diotima
plane
and
the
beneath
whose
branches
gautama
buddha
sought
and
found
the
path
of
enlightenment
there
grew
the
of
egypt
the
repository
through
many
centuries
of
a
whole
world
learning
the
that
grow
no
longer
in
their
old
home
even
as
the
prophet
isaiah
foretold
and
there
the
clove
for
whose
perfumed
pistils
great
nations
had
warred
together
and
brave
men
died
under
torture
there
stood
the
english
trees
the
oak
and
the
white
acacia
which
had
built
the
for
the
greatest
sea
captain
the
world
has
seen
there
was
that
great
traveller
the
mulberry
which
had
left
its
home
on
the
yangtse
to
follow
the
old
silk
route
across
asia
which
had
crossed
the
stony
gobi
where
wild
camels
run
and
the
djinn
light
their
lamps
at
night
to
decoy
travellers
which
had
seen
the
khotan
girls
wading
in
the
khotan
river
searching
for
the
previous
white
jade
which
should
make
gods
for
china
as
erstwhile
for
nineveh
and
troy
which
had
skirted
the
wandering
lake
of
and
had
tarried
awhile
in
old
dead
cities
now
buried
under
the
sands
of
the
dreaded
taklamakan
which
had
seen
the
turquoise
mines
of
khorassan
and
voyaged
on
the
broad
oxus
stream
till
from
iran
its
way
lay
clear
to
the
west
there
grew
the
cedars
of
the
atlas
which
had
aided
their
great
mountain
to
support
the
sky
and
had
sailed
south
with
hanno
to
the
guinea
gulf
to
bring
home
those
gorilla
hides
which
lay
on
the
altar
of
melcarth
at
carthage
and
there
the
most
famous
of
all
the
trees
of
the
forest
the
proud
cedars
of
lebanon
which
had
once
exulted
with
their
voices
over
the
fall
of
the
king
of
assyria
which
had
built
for
solomon
his
temple
and
his
house
for
the
daughter
of
pharaoh
and
which
had
given
to
the
princes
of
tyre
the
ships
in
which
greatly
daring
they
had
ranged
the
three
seas
bringing
home
the
gold
of
india
and
the
silver
of
spain
and
the
tin
of
cornwall
the
wealth
of
the
east
and
the
west
myrrh
and
frankincense
and
purple
dye
ivory
and
apes
and
peacocks
and
last
of
all
was
the
twisted
gray
olive
beloved
of
pallas
athene
the
symbol
of
all
that
raises
man
above
the
savage
the
tree
in
whose
train
as
it
moved
out
from
its
home
in
asia
had
grown
up
all
the
civilizations
that
ringed
the
mediterranean
so
fiona
passed
through
the
grove
and
came
out
on
a
broad
place
of
grass
and
right
before
her
stood
the
fairy
ring
but
not
such
a
one
as
the
ring
on
glenollisdal
which
she
knew
this
ring
was
of
vast
size
and
round
it
grew
in
a
circle
huge
red
toadstools
splotched
with
white
the
red
toadstools
from
which
the
witches
of
lapland
had
used
to
brew
philtres
of
love
and
death
but
vast
as
it
was
it
could
not
hold
all
the
creatures
that
swarmed
round
it
it
was
a
gathering
such
as
fiona
had
never
dreamt
of
on
the
outskirts
stood
an
innumerable
host
of
little
strange
beings
of
every
sort
and
shape
elves
and
brownies
gnomes
and
pixies
trolls
and
kobolds
goblins
and
leprechauns
and
the
babel
of
them
as
they
whispered
together
was
like
the
noise
of
a
flock
of
fieldfares
and
within
them
and
around
the
ring
itself
stood
the
fairies
all
the
lost
peoples
and
nations
and
languages
it
seemed
were
there
in
miniature
everyone
that
fiona
had
ever
heard

speak
of

in

stood

carved
out
of
a

beryl
green
as
the

and
on
the
throne
sat
the
king
of
the

as

white
gold
which
has
long
since
perished
out
of
the
upper
world
and
in
the
end
of
his
sceptre
was
set
a
double
pentacle
of
clear
crystal
brought
from
the
island
of
desire
and
in
the
beryl
throne
if
he
looked
at
it
through
the
crystal
were
shown
to
him
the
reflections
of
all
things
that
he
might
wish
to
see
if
he
looked
directly
he
saw
all
that
had
happened
in
the
world
in
the
past
and
if
he
reversed
the
crystal
he
saw
all
that
should
happen
in
the
future
but
if
he
held
the
pentacle
edgewise
then
he
saw
the
present
which
no
man
ever
sees
and
was
the
greatest
magic
of
all
round
the
throne
stood
his
guards
black
as
moors
in
jackets
and
trousers
of
emerald
green
clasped
with
orange
zircons

of
them
bore
trumpets
of
silver
and
half
of
them
carried
spears
with
heads
of
green
obsidian
as
sharp
as
steel
and
on
either
side
of
the
throne
on
a
stool
sat
a
strange
creature
a
little
wizened
elf
with
a
large
book
on
his
knee
one
wore
a
white
cap
and
he
bore
an
inkhorn
and
a
bundle
of
long
quills
the
other
wore
a
black
cap
and
he
bore
a
penknife
fiona
edged
herself
as
far
forward
as
she
could
into
the
ring
of
strange
beings
and
found
herself
next
an
old
leprechaun
with
a
face
like
a
wrinkled
apple
who
seemed
quite
inclined
to
be
friendly
a
human
he
said
we
do
not
see
as
many
as
we
used
to
but
they
say
there
are
two
to
be
tried
as
you
see
we
have
attempted
something
out
of
the
ordinary
in
the
way
of
a
welcome
and
he
waved
his
arm
proudly
round
the
enormous
assembly
had
far
to
come
he
asked
fiona
told
him
how
long
it
had
taken
her
that
nothing
he
said
there
are
people
here
who
as
soon
as
the
dance
is
over
will
start
travelling
as
fast
as
they
can
and
will
only
just
arrive
in
time
for
next
year
meeting
good
for
the
shoemaking
trade
where
do
they
try
the
prisoners
she
asked
him
here
in
the
ring
said
the
leprechaun
the
king
tries
them
there
the
public
prosecutor
and
he
pointed
to
a
fairy
of
pompous
aspect
with
a
hooked
nose
and
a
roman
toga
and
a
roll
under
his
arm
he
a
terrible
fellow
and
there
the
king
remembrancer
those
two
with
the
books
why
are
there
two
asked
fiona
one
to
remember
and
one
to
forget
of
course
stupid
said
the
leprechaun
whereever
were
you
educated
do
you
think
kings
want
to
remember
it
must
be
very
easy
forgetting
said
fiona
hardest
job
in
fairyland
said
the
leprechaun
i
suppose
you
know
lots
of
people
with
perfect
memories
but
you
never
knew
one
with
a
perfect
forgetfulness
eh
whitecap
there
only
has
to
write
his
book
up
but
poor
blackcap
he
the
one
that
forgets
his
book
is
written
up
to
start
with
and
he
has
to
get
the
pages
clean
again
with
his
penknife
he
never
gets
them
clean
they
say
he
has
nightmare
every
night
over
the
things
he
ca
forget
altogether
the
king
had
been
talking
to
one
of
the
officers
of
his
guard
he
now
rose
and
held
out
his
sceptre
and
there
was
a
great
silence
round
the
fairy
ring
before
we
dance
he
said
we
have
as
you
know
to
try
two
prisoners
he
turned
to
the
officer
of
the
guard
and
said
let
them
be
produced
the
officer
at
once
produced
the
urchin
from
nowhere
in
particular
as
a
conjurer
produces
the
boy
looked
rather
large
among
the
little
people
but
otherwise
he
was
much
as
fiona
had
last
seen
him
his
shirt
and
knickerbockers
were
covered
with
earthstains
and
he
still
had
the
same
length
of
useless
rope
coiled
round
his
waist
but
jeconiah
was
this
the
prosperous
financier
this
wretched
apology
for
a
living
being
which
the
officer
held
out
on
the
palm
of
his
hand
not
two
inches
high
its
white
waistcoat
hanging
in
loose
flaps
speechless
and
with
terror
and
abject
entreaty
it
was
like
the
ghost
of
a
parody
the
officer
had
to
set
it
on
one
of
the
great
toadstools
and
mark
the
place
with
a
stick
lest
it
should
be
lost
the
king
regarded
it
with
interest
i
understood
that
the
elder
prisoner
was
a
very
stout
man
he
said
that
was
so
your
majesty
said
the
officer
he
was
so
stout
that
we
thought
it
useless
to
attempt
to
take
him
through
the
doorway
as
he
was
so
we
left
his
body
behind
and
only
brought
away
the
essential
part
of
him
this
is
all
that
there
really
is
of
him
sire
the
rest
was
wind
when
we
began
to
sift
him
we
were
afraid
that
he
had
no
real
existence
at
all
and
that
there
would
be
nothing
to
bring
before
you
well
well
said
the
king
there
enough
of
him
to
be
tried
anyhow
are
the
prisoners
provided
with
counsel
the
public
prosecutor
was
understood
to
say
that
they
were
not
yet
represented
counsel
had
better
be
assigned
them
in
the
usual
way
said
the
king
catch
somebody
he
took
a
guinea
from
his
pocket
and
flung
it
apparently
without
looking
into
the
crowd
but
thick
as
the
crowd
was
the
guinea
passed
straight
through
the
forest
of
hands
held
out
for
it
and
fell
into
a
tiny
brown
hand
behind
them
fiona
knew
where
she
had
seen
that
hand
before
the
owner
of
the
hand
at
once
stepped
forward
into
the
ring
he
seemed
to
be
the
most
singular
being
in
fairyland
fiona
first
impression
was
that
he
was
just
a
large
bald
head
the
color
of
parchment
and
wrinkled
all
over
and
this
impression
remained
even
when
she
realized
that
he
did
possess
a
small
body
with
the
usual
allowance
of
arms
and
legs
out
of
his
great
head
looked
a
pair
of
quite
incongruous
eyes
bright
as
beads
and
full
of
happy
drollery
behind
him
came
a
couple
of
stout
goblins
each
laden
with
dusty
law
books
they
piled
the
books
up
in
a
stack
on
the
ground
and
the
singular
creature
with
the
head
proceeded
to
climb
to
the
top
of
the
stack
where
he
sat
down
cracking
his
fingers
and
laughing
hugely
at
some
jest
of
his
own
evidently
on
the
best
of
terms
both
with
himself
and
his
audience
then
he
caught
fiona
eye
and
deliberately
winked
at
her
but
somehow
it
carried
no
offence
for
the
creature
seemed
absolutely
free
from
malice
privilege
honorable
profession
defend
oppressed
he
remarked
duty
clients
submit
large
number
points
and
he
patted
the
books
he
sat
on
he
had
a
habit
of
clipping
his
words
as
he
spoke
which
was
totally
destructive
of
the
smaller
parts
of
speech
and
made
his
remarks
sound
like
a
series
of
unedited
cablegrams
we
will
take
the
younger
prisoner
first
announced
the
king
whereupon
the
public
prosecutor
proceeded
to
read
all
in
one
breath
the
indictment
against
the
urchin
to
the
effect
that
he
did
on
or
about
the
day
of
september
then
last
past
in
despite
of
the
peace
of
the
realm
and
the
safety
of
the
lieges
with
a
stone
or
some
other
missile
or
thing
throw
at
and
break
the
wing
of
or
otherwise
hit
cut
hurt
maim
destroy
and
do
wrong
to
one
of
the
said
lieges
to
wit
a
shore
lark
and
so
forth
when
he
had
finished
instead
of
evidence
being
taken
the
king
merely
glanced
into
the
beryl
throne
true
in
fact
he
said
any
defence
the
creature
on
the
bookstack
began
at
once
please
majesty
duty
client
submit
series
points
first
point
no
intention
but
fiona
did
not
wait
to
hear
what
it
had
to
say
forcing
her
way
into
the
ring
she
said
please
your
majesty
it
was
my
fault
i
told
him
he
could
the
king
turned
to
look
at
her
so
this
is
the
young
lady
he
said
very
good
of
you
to
come
you
know
we
rarely
receive
visitors
now
we
shall
try
to
make
you
welcome
when
the
trial
is
over
he
turned
again
to
the
bookstack
and
said
i
will
hear
the
defence
it
was
my
fault
your
majesty
said
fiona
again
with
grave
patience
the
king
started
to
explain
to
her
your
part
of
it
was
your
fault
of
course
but
we
are
not
trying
you
for
you
have
come
here
of
your
own
free
will
so
we
can
neither
try
nor
punish
but
his
part
of
it
was
equally
his
own
fault
and
unless
there
is
a
good
defence
he
will
have
to
be
punished
the
creature
on
the
bookstack
was
nodding
and
signing
to
fiona
but
she
was
too
engrossed
with
a
single
thought
to
notice
him
then
i
claim
my
wish
your
majesty
she
said
quite
in
order
said
the
king
the
trial
will
be
suspended
while
the
young
lady
wishes
officer
and
immediately
the
fairy
ring
was
strewn
with
a
strange
collection
of
objects
looking
rather
like
the
contents
of
an
old
curiosity
shop
that
had
gone
bankrupt
the
officer
held
them
up
one
by
one
for
fiona
to
see
when
we
heard
you
were
coming
said
the
king
we
collected
a
few
little
things
for
your
inspection
it
is
so
long
since
we
had
any
use
for
any
of
them
that
many
of
them
seem
to
have
developed
serious
defects
which
we
regret
but
they
are
the
best
we
could
find
at
short
notice
this
he
pointed
to
an
old
ring
is
a
common
wishing
ring
it
used
to
do
all
the
usual
things
the
genie
attached
to
it
has
unfortunately
become
very
deaf
with
age
but
if
you
can
make
him
hear
we
believe
he
is
still
in
fair
working
order
this
as
a
frayed
girdle
was
held
up
is
the
famous
cestus
of
aphrodite
which
she
lent
to
helen
of
troy
its
wearer
used
to
become
the
most
beautiful
and
unpopular
creature
in
the
world
it
will
still
confer
beauty
though
hardly
suited
to
the
modern
style
the
unpopularity
we
guarantee
this
pointing
to
a
huge
book
contains
the
truth
of
that
which
in
your
world
passes
as
knowledge
it
would
delight
your
father
he
might
publish
selected
chapters
and
watch
the
critics
cut
them
to
pieces
this
as
a
battered
trumpet
was
exhibited
is
fame
your
praises
would
be
sung
all
over
the
world
and
the
world
would
say
mind
what
she
has
tell
us
about
her
faults
this
and
he
contemplated
an
old
iron
sceptre
is
power
you
would
become
a
great
ruler
and
would
probably
die
in
exile
and
under
this
and
he
pointed
to
a
sheet
of
black
velvet
thrown
loosely
over
some
object
under
this
is
the
treasure
of
the
isle
of
mist
which
i
am
told
that
you
have
heard
of
do
any
of
these
please
you
if
not
we
have
others
fiona
never
thought
about
it
for
a
moment
of
course
she
had
not
done
all
that
she
had
done
to
hesitate
now
she
did
not
look
at
the
face
and
she
took
not
the
least
notice
of
the
creature
with
the
head
who
was
dancing
about
in
a
perfect
agony
trying
to
attract
her
attention
please
your
majesty
she
said
in
breathless
haste
i
came
here
to
find
the
urchin
and
take
him
home
with
me
that
is
my
wish
she
had
hardly
spoken
the
words
when
her
instinct
told
her
something
was
wrong
a
sort
of
chill
seemed
to
run
through
the
air
and
the
color
seemed
to
go
out
of
the
fairy
world
the
creature
with
the
head
stopped
dancing
about
and
began
to
wring
its
little
hands
she
looked
up
at
the
king
face
and
read
there
was
it
disappointment
was
it
regret
she
hardly
knew
a
very
natural
and
proper
wish
said
the
king
gravely
we
shall
of
course
accept
it
as
such
and
grant
it
with
great
pleasure
the
younger
prisoner
is
discharged
take
the
next
case
and
then
fiona
saw
she
saw
the
thing
which
had
once
been
jeconiah
with
that
look
of
abject
terror
and
entreaty
in
its
eyes
and
she
realized
that
it
would
have
meant
nothing
to
her
to
have
included
jeconiah
in
her
wish
and
that
for
jeconiah
it
would
have
meant
everything
and
she
realized
also
that
worthless
and
evil
as
he
had
been
in
life
selfish
mean
a
thief
and
a
liar
he
was
still
a
human
being
and
had
a
soul
and
possibilities
of
which
the
fairy
world
could
know
nothing
she
felt
a
wave
of
humiliation
pass
over
her
and
she
resolved
that
whatever
he
was
and
whatever
happened
she
would
not
go
home
without
jeconiah
the
charges
against
jeconiah
were
then
read
stealing
a
treasure
and
being
a
worthless
character
any
defence
said
the
king
the
creature
with
the
head
got
to
work
please
majesty
he
said

intention

admitted
but
did
not
succeed
fiona
in
her
humility
had
been
listening
to
what
the
creature
with
the
head
was
saying
and
suddenly
it
dawned
on
her
that
all
through
both
he
and
the
king
had
been
trying
to
help
her
so
far
as
was
consistent
with
their
own
rules
and
that
perhaps
the
creature
with
the
head
for
all
his
oddity
knew
what
he
was
doing
she
asked
the
leprechaun
who
he
was
you
might
have
asked
that
with
advantage
before
you
interrupted
him
said
the
leprechaun
severely
he
is
our
chancellor
here
he
is
the
king
most
intimate
friend
and
far
the
ablest
lawyer
in
fairyland
defence
to
first
count
not
admitted
the
king
was
saying
your
client
can
not
plead
his
own
bungling
of
the
theft
in
mitigation
of
his
wrongdoing
only
the
intention
counts
here
the
chancellor
looked
immensely
relieved
at
the
king
words
though
it
passed
fiona
wit
to
see
why
apply
formal
ruling
he
said
take
down
this
to
whitecap
i
hold
that
nothing
counts
here
but
the
intention
said
the
king
majesty
pleases
said
the
chancellor
settles
point
retire
defence
this
prisoner
submit
excellent
point
younger
client
we
will
pass
sentence
here
first
said
the
king
jeconiah
johnson
your
counsel
has
very
properly
thrown
up
his
brief
you
are
convicted
of
stealing
a
treasure
and
it
is
admitted
that
you
are
a
worthless
character
on
the
first
count
i
sentence
you
to
be
handed
over
to
the
executioner
to
be
extended
until
you
become
a
proper
size
if
you
survive
you
will
then
undergo
as
offered
by
your
counsel
the
state
cure
at
the
hands
of
the
state
hypnotizer
he
turned
to
the
chancellor
any
further
submission
fiona
had
gone
over
to
the
stack
of
books
and
bent
down
over
the
little
creature
with
the
head
i
have
made
a
most
terrible
mistake
she
said
in
a
low
voice
i
have
spoilt
everything
i
see
that
you
are
kind
can
you
help
us
should
have
come
me
first
said
the
creature
quite
gently
tried
attract
attention
never
neglect
anyone
merely
because
odd
and
ugly
may
have
good
heart
sad
mess
now
but
think
see
daylight
any
influence
that
boy
oh
yes
said
fiona
eagerly
right
said
the
creature
make
boy
wish
now
follow
my
argument
and
he
turned
to
the
king
please
majesty
submit
good
point
majesty
just
ruled
nothing
counts
here
but
intention
younger
prisoner
no
intention
hurt
shore
lark
therefore
on
majesty
ruling
same
as
if
did
not
hurt
it
therefore
never
was
guilty
human
prisoner
adjudged
not
guilty
is
just
same
as
if
came
here
own
free
will
so
held
majesty
father
and
by
some
extraordinary
trick
he
got
the
top
book
open
and
flopped
down
among
the
leaves
from
which
position
he
read
out
bits
of
an
ancient
judgment
consequently
younger
prisoner
both
entitled
and
bound
wish
the
king
consulted
whitecap
it
seems
a
sound
chain
of
reasoning
he
said
then
he
turned
to
the
public
prosecutor
have
you
anything
to
urge
against
it
only
that
if
he
wishes
wrong
we
ca
detain
him
because
of
the
young
lady
wish
said
that
official
daniel
come
judgment
cried
the
chancellor
triumphantly
heads
win
tails
ca
lose
younger
prisoner
wish
he
turned
to
fiona
and
whispered
to
her
mind
he
wishes
right
fiona
started
to
go
over
to
the
urchin
instantly
the
guard
crossed
their
spears
before
her
no
interference
allowed
with
anyone
who
is
going
to
wish
said
the
officer
then
she
tried
to
call
to
him
and
found
that
she
could
not
speak
it
was
like
a
nightmare
she
looked
helplessly
at
the
chancellor
he
nodded
and
spelt
on
his
fingers
the
word
think
then
fiona
understood
what
he
had
meant
by
asking
her
if
she
had
any
influence
over
the
urchin
she
knew
that
she
had
a
good
deal
and
bits
of
conversations
with
her
father
came
back
into
her
mind
she
had
made
one
bad
blunder
and
she
had
to
correct
it
as
best
she
could
and
without
more
ado
she
concentrated
her
whole
mind
on
taking
possession
of
the
mind
of
the
urchin
could
it
be
done
at
all
and
if
so
could
it
be
done
in
time
the
king
stretched
out
his
sceptre
and
there
was
silence
the
younger
prisoner
is
going
to
wish
said
the
king
officer
and
immediately
there
appeared
in
the
middle
of
the
ring
six
great
boxes
old
sea
chests
made
of
spanish
chestnut
battered
and
stained
and
clamped
with
bands
of
iron
and
on
each
was
the
picture
half
obliterated
by
time
and
salt
water
of
the
madonna
of
the
holy
cross
the
officer
flung
back
the
lids
and
showed
each
chest
full
to
the
brim
of
glittering
golden
doubloons
that
is
the
treasure
from
the
venetian
galleon
which
you
were
seeking
said
the
king
we
removed
it
long
ago
into
our
safe
custody
lest
it
should
tempt
men
but
it
would
seem
that
it
tempts
them
none
the
less
now
wish
the
urchin
his
eyes
bulging
out
of
his
head
stared
at
the
shining
gold
he
murmured
gun
but
fortunately
so
low
that
the
king
did
not
hear
him
fiona
kept
her
eyes
fixed
hard
on
the
boy
and
bent
every
effort
of
mind
and
will
to
the
one
thought
that
he
must
wish
as
she
wished
if
only
he
would
turn
round
she
had
already
lost
sight
of
the
fairies
she
now
lost
sight
of
the
king
she
was
conscious
only
of
the
abject
wretched
creature
that
was
jeconiah
and
of
the
back
of
the
head
he
was
still
staring
at
the
gold
but
he
had
not
yet
spoken
that
was
to
the
good
and
no
it
was
not
fancy
his
ears
were
turning
pink
as
they
always
did
when
he
was
in
a
difficulty
then
he
began
to
shuffle
his
feet
uneasily
fiona
felt
that
every
atom
of
life
and
force
in
her
was
being
concentrated
on
that
one
act
of
will
she
did
not
think
she
could
go
through
with
it
many
seconds
longer
or
she
would
collapse
and
then
the
urchin
turned
his
head
toward
her
his
face
was
scarlet
and
his
eyes
were
wavering
before
the
fixed
gaze
of
her
own
he
do
as
she
wished
she
flung
everything
into
one
supreme
effort
the
last
reserves
which
no
one
thinks
they
possess
till
utter
necessity
teaches
them
the
contrary
and
then
the
urchin
spoke
in
a
strange
voice
and
all
in
one
breath
i
want
my
uncle
to
go
free
fiona
will
let
go
with
a
snap
she
felt
so
dizzy
that
she
had
to
lean
against
one
of
the
great
toadstools
or
she
would
have
fallen
round
the
assemblage
ran
a
sound
like
the
wind
through
the
tree
tops
the
noise
of
thousands
drawing
in
breath
at
once
and
the
chancellor
started
a
war
dance
on
his
stack
of
books
and
nearly
fell
off
on
his
head
the
king
rose
from
his
throne
but
he
took
no
notice
of
the
urchin
he
turned
straight
to
fiona
and
bowed
to
her
my
compliments
young
lady
he
said
the
prettiest
piece
of
it
has
ever
been
our
privilege
to
see
where
did
you
learn
to
do
it
i
never
learnt
stammered
fiona
i
made
a
great
mistake
as
your
majesty
saw
and
something
had
to
be
done
and
your
friend
suggested
this
way
you
need
mind
having
made
a
mistake
said
the
king
if
you
make
mistakes
sometimes
you
never
make
anything
else
and
you
have
made
something
else
this
time
with
a
vengeance
as
for
you
sirrah
and
he
shook
his
fist
at
the
chancellor
the
creature
snapped
all
its
fingers
in
reply
majesty
pleases
it
began
triumphantly
duty
younger
client
submit
new
point
arising
young
lady
action
client
entitled
wish
did
not
wish
himself
young
lady
wished
therefore
client
still
entitled
wish
propose
develop
point
considerable
length
with
authorities
the
king
raised
his
hand
i
think
i
shall
have
to
intervene
he
said
i
believe
you
would
submit
points
till
cockcrow
submit
points
till
next
year
if
majesty
pleases
said
the
creature
gleefully
if
these
proceedings
do
end
soon
said
the
king
there
will
be
no
time
to
dance
and
if
we
did
dance
no
one
knows
what
would
happen
to
the
world
above
even
i
do
know
that
so
as
we
do
not
generally
have
three
human
beings
here
at
once
and
as
substantial
justice
has
been
done
i
propose
now
to
exercise
the
royal
prerogative
of
generosity
jeconiah
johnson
you
will
as
requested
go
free
so
far
as
we
can
set
you
free
we
can
not
set
you
free
from
your
own
worthless
character
in
order
however
to
do
the
best
for
you
that
can
be
done
before
you
leave
us
the
state
hypnotizer
will
take
you
in
hand
and
instil
into
you
a
few
decent
feelings
he
wo
hurt
you
and
you
wo
remember
the
effect
i
fear
will
not
be
permanent
but
it
will
ease
our
conscience
and
as
a
sign
to
the
world
above
that
we
have
treated
you
liberally
you
will
find
that
you
will
be
unable
to
attend
to
business
until
you
have
told
your
nephew
a
fairy
tale
urchin
a
doubt
exists
as
to
whether
you
have
had
your
wish
or
not
you
shall
have
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
so
far
as
is
good
for
you
you
will
find
that
you
will
get
your
gun
and
then
the
king
turned
to
fiona
young
lady
he
said
you
have
given
us
a
display
of
courage
which
we
are
not
likely
to
forget
you
have
rescued
your
friend
you
have
which
is
much
more
to
the
point
rescued
your
enemy
you
have
got
wishes
out
of
us
which
no
one
ever
did
before
and
you
have
asked
nothing
for
yourself
and
now
what
are
we
to
do
for
you
i
think
i
have
everything
i
want
now
thank
your
majesty
said
fiona
did
we
not
hear
talk
of
a
treasure
said
the
king
yes
said
fiona
but
i
was
not
thinking
about
a
treasure
your
majesty
i
know
said
the
king
but
i
was
all
the
time
i
must
leave
it
all
in
your
majesty
hands
said
fiona
it
is
not
here
said
the
king
what
you
saw
was
only
a
pretence
and
we
can
not
send
for
it
but
if
you
will
honor
us
sometime
by
returning
to
our
kingdom
we
will
see
what
can
be
done
in
memory
of
your
visit
any
time
you
like
and
by
the
front
door
please
you
will
run
no
risks
that
way
and
now
said
the
king
stretching
out
his
sceptre
over
the
great
throng
we
will
dance
he
turned
to
fiona
and
the
urchin
it
will
be
a
little
while
before
johnson
is
ready
to
accompany
you
home
he
said
perhaps
you
will
honor
us
meanwhile
by
attending
the
dance
also
so
the
fairies
danced
before
the
king
and
the
fairy
ring
whirled
and
blazed
with
the
color
of
them
till
it
was
gayer
than
a
in
blossom
and
brighter
than
a
swarm
of
on
a
june
and
more
vivid
than
a
fall
of
shooting
stars
and
the
music
that
they
made
was
wilder
than
the
wind
in
the
strings
of
a
harp
and
sweeter
than
the
blackbird
song
and
dearer
than
all
the
burns
on
the
moor
murmuring
in
unison
and
the
two
children
sat
at
the
king
feet
on
the
steps
of
the
beryl
throne
and
watched
the
dancers
and
the
chancellor
sat
between
them
and
held
fiona
hand
and
told
them
such
stories
as
they
had
never
heard
before
till
between
laughter
and
tears
they
nearly
fell
off
the
steps
of
the
throne
and
the
chancellor
laughed
and
cried
with
them
for
sheer
joy
in
his
own
and
if
there
were
three
happier
people
in
the
world
that
night
i
do
not
know
where
they
were
and
the
night
itself
passed
away
as
a
dream
that
men
dream
and
its
hours
seemed
to
them
but
as
a
few
minutes
and
then
across
the
music
and
the
dance
cut
the
shrill
harsh
scream
of
a
peacock
as
he
greeted
the
day
the
children
saw
the
king
rise
from
his
throne
and
stretch
his
sceptre
out
over
the
ring
and
the
ring
and
the
dancers
were
shrouded
in
a
white
mist
which
rose
from
the
ground
and
wreathed
its
arms
about
them
and
the
beryl
throne
dissolved
in
mist
and
the
figure
of
the
king
above
them
pointing
grew
dim
and
huge
and
spread
and
grew
a
purple
shadow
that
hung
over
them
and
they
were
standing
alone
in
the
fairy
ring
on
glenollisdal
under
the
purple
sky
with
the
white
mist
wreathing
itself
about
their
feet
and
the
pale
november
dawn
coming
slowly
up
out
of
the
sea
did
the
urchin
fling
himself
on
the
grass
at
fiona
feet
and
thank
her
in
broken
accents
for
all
she
had
done
for
him
i
regret
to
state
that
the
first
thing
which
the
urchin
did
was
to
feel
in
his
pocket
and
draw
out
the
doubloon
which
he
had
found
in
the
cave
i
got
this
one
anyhow
fiona
he
said
but
i
wonder
how
going
to
get
that
gun
then
something
seemed
to
prick
him
he
began
to
look
uncomfortable
and
shuffle
his
feet
while
his
ears
turned
pink
and
at
last
he
managed
to
blurt
out
i
say
fiona
it
was
jolly
decent
of
you
you
know
fiona
only
smiled
the
wise
smile
of
perfect
understanding
that
morning
the
doctor
was
hastily
summoned
with
the
news
that
jeconiah
was
awake
the
nurse
met
him
in
the
passage
and
rather
frightened
he
so
strange
she
said
tut
tut
said
the
doctor
told
you
he
might
wake
like
that
kind
of
change
in
personality
just
so
often
happens
seldom
permanent
though
what
he
done
well
doctor
of
course
we
all
know
johnson
reputation
said
the
nurse
he
thanked
me
three
times
and
hoped
i
did
tire
myself
and
he
had
all
the
servants
up
and
said
he
see
their
wages
were
raised
and
the
cook
gave
notice
on
the
spot
because
she
said
she
did
like
practical
jokes
and
he
says
he
wants
to
go
out
and
gather
buttercups
and
daisies
and
play
with
the
little
frogs
and
he
sent
for
some
old
gun
that
he
says
he
got
to
buy
for
his
nephew
and
he
has
opened
any
of
the
telegrams
that
have
been
waiting
for
him
he
says
he
may
attend
to
business
till
he
has
learnt
a
fairy
tale
and
he
had
the
library
ransacked
and
he
tearing
his
hair
because
there
no
such
thing
in
it
oh
well
said
the
doctor
we
must
just
have
patience
nurse
i
expected
something
of
the
sort
just
humor
him
if
you
ca
find
a
fairy
tale
try
him
with
a
history
book
he
never
know
the
difference
and
i
send
him
up
a
nice
soothing
mixture
very
interesting
case
interesting
and
the
doctor
calling
up
his
best
professional
smile
bustled
into
jeconiah
room
it
was
the
same
afternoon
a
still
afternoon
of
indian
summer
that
the
old
hawker
accompanied
again
by
the
black
terrier
was
going
down
the
shore
road
he
must
have
had
business
at
the
cottage
on
the
beach
but
his
business
was
probably
not
urgent
for
he
stopped
to
watch
with
interest
a
group
on
the
shore
it
consisted
of
jeconiah
and
the
urchin
and
they
sat
on
the
little
patch
of
sand
at
the
mouth
of
the
burn
the
urchin
had
across
his
knees
the
rusty
old
gun
bought
for
him
by
jeconiah
who
had
nevertheless
exacted
the
doubloon
from
him
in
exchange
he
fingered
the
gun
lovingly
while
he
gazed
with
undisguised
impatience
at
the
proceedings
of
his
uncle
coat
lay
on
the
grounds
beside
a
sheaf
of
unopened
telegrams
and
he
was
putting
the
finishing
touches
to
a
noble
castle
of
sand
its
drawbridge
was
supported
by
his
double
watch
chain
and
its
turrets
bore
a
suspicious
resemblance
in
contour
to
the
inside
of
his
hat
he
patted
his
work
and
gazed
at
it
with
pride
fine
is
it
he
said
you
better
hurry
up
with
that
fairy
tale
said
the
boy
if
got
to
you
got
to
you
know
and
you
wo
keep
me
much
once
i
get
some
cartridges
jeconiah
began
to
look
alarmed
but
i
have
found
one
yet
he
said
and
glanced
anxiously
at
the
pile
of
telegrams
make
one
up
then
said
the
boy
anybody
can
do
it
thus
adjured
jeconiah
started
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
very
grizzly
old
bear
and
he
lived
in
a
beautiful
place
called
capel
court
and
he
used
to
hunt
the
wild
bulls
and
the
stags
and
the
poor
little
guinea
pigs
that
abounded
in
that
salubrious
locality
and
there
were
two
young
ladies
there
called
cora
and
dora
are
those
the
princesses
asked
the
boy
no
i
think
not
said
jeconiah
they
were
of
quite
ordinary
stock
well
the
old
bear
thought
they
were
too
high
and
mighty
and
that
he
would
like
to
take
them
down
a
point
or
two
oh
this
wo
do
said
the
urchin
rudely
this
is
a
fairy
tale
at
all
you
must
do
something
better
than
that
the
wretched
jeconiah
groaned
and
looked
again
at
his
telegrams
then
he
started
afresh
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
great
dragon
with
seven
heads
and
he
ate
seven
princesses
every
day
for
dinner
that
better
said
the
boy
encouragingly
as
he
settled
himself
to
listen
the
old
hawker
resumed
his
walk
they
have
made
a
very
good
job
of
him
after
all
he
remarked
aloud
apparently
to
the
terrier
but
i
expect
that
sort
is
incurable
was
it
a
flicker
of
sunlight
or
did
the
black
terrier
really
wink
chapter
viii
fiona
finds
her
treasure
and
fiona
fiona
sat
on
the
hearthrug
in
the
bookroom
and
told
her
father
the
whole
story
from
beginning
to
end
as
it
has
been
told
here
and
sometimes
he
asked
a
question
and
sometimes
he
said
yes
that
would
be
so
and
sometimes
he
stroked
her
hair
and
said
nothing
and
when
she
had
ended
he
said
so
you
never
found
your
own
treasure
after
all
fiona
she
said
i
suppose
i
can
have
it
now
if
i
go
back
do
you
think
you
will
go
back
he
asked
she
replied
with
another
question
have
you
found
out
what
my
treasure
is
daddy
i
believe
i
could
guess
he
answered
but
you
have
found
a
good
many
things
already
apart
from
treasure
have
you
little
daughter
she
sat
silent
and
looked
into
the
fire
i
suppose
i
have
she
said
we
wo
enumerate
them
said
the
student
it
spoils
things
entirely
sometimes
to
put
them
into
words
but
i
will
tell
you
something
an
old
writer
once
said
he
was
talking
of
that
particular
kind
of
treasure
which
men
call
truth
and
he
said
that
if
he
were
offered
truth
itself
on
the
one
hand
and
the
everlasting
search
for
it
on
the
other
hand
he
would
choose
the
search
i
expect
you
can
understand
that
now
for
you
have
seen
what
has
happened
to
you
over
your
own
search
i
think
i
can
understand
said
fiona
i
must
be
growing
older
daddy
you
be
too
old
soon
to
go
back
to
fairyland
at
all
little
daughter
said
the
student
if
you
are
going
you
will
have
to
go
at
once
what
do
you
think
daddy
she
questioned
i
can
only
tell
you
that
in
my
case
i
went
back
the
student
answered
why
daddy
have
you
been
in
fairyland
too
cried
fiona
and
you
never
told
me
yes
said
the
student
even
a
musty
old
scholar
like
myself
was
young
once
you
know
and
he
looked
into
the
fire
with
eyes
which
seemed
to
see
things
very
very
far
away
it
was
not
quite
the
same
as
the
fairyland
you
have
been
in
fiona
but
we
called
it
fairyland
ca
you
come
back
with
me
if
i
go
daddy
asked
the
girl
i
too
old
now
little
daughter
he
said
for
good
or
for
bad
i
could
never
find
the
way
again
i
can
only
see
it
now
through
your
eyes
i
come
as
far
as
the
door
with
you
and
that
all
that
an
old
man
can
do
i
suppose
you
know
where
the
door
is
i
never
felt
there
was
any
doubt
said
fiona
then
we
start
first
thing
if
it
calm
enough
he
said
but
that
evening
was
the
last
of
the
golden
autumn
and
when
fiona
woke
in
the
morning
the
isle
of
mist
was
justifying
its
name
the
southwest
gale
was
raging
round
the
house
like
a
live
animal
seizing
it
and
shaking
it
and
wailing
in
the
chimneys
pitifully
like
an
unburied
ghost
and
before
the
gale
the
long
rollers
were
racing
in
from
the
atlantic
smashing
themselves
on
the
crags
and
shooting
up
heavenward
in
columns
of
spray
thrice
the
height
of
the
cliffs
while
the
noise
of
the
surf
in
the
scargill
cave
came
booming
across
the
water
like
the
roar
of
a
battleship
guns
the
hills
were
all
shrouded
in
mist
and
the
mist
was
fine
salt
rain
that
rolled
in
from
the
sea
driving
in
billows
over
the
moor
and
across
the
fields
the
gulls
were
tossed
about
in
it
like
little
bits
of
waste
paper
and
every
green
thing
on
the
island
opened
its
heart
to
the
rain
and
drank
till
it
could
drink
no
more
toward
evening
fiona
and
the
student
in
oilskins
and
went
down
to
the
rocks
and
out
seaward
as
far
as
was
possible
and
there
stood
unable
to
speak
for
the
noise
they
balanced
themselves
against
the
gusts
and
felt
the
tingling
drops
of
salt
spray
rattle
like
hail
off
their
coats
while
they
watched
the
cliff
waterfalls
unable
to
fall
for
the
wind
go
straight
up
heavenward
in
clouds
of
smoke
and
the
sea
foam
and
tear
at
the
rocks
below
and
once
for
a
moment
the
parted
and
the
hills
started
out
their
dark
sides
all
gashed
and
seamed
with
white
streaks
where
every
tiny
runlet
and
burn
was
rushing
in
spate
down
toward
the
sea
fiona
managed
to
shout
with
her
clear
young
voice
no
one
can
really
love
this
island
who
only
knows
it
in
summer
and
then
they
went
home
out
of
the
dusk
and
the
lashing
of
the
wet
wind
to
the
quiet
bookroom
and
tea
things
and
lamps
and
books
for
man
may
love
nature
but
he
loves
still
better
the
contrast
between
nature
and
the
things
which
he
has
fashioned
for
himself
for
three
weeks
the
wind
blew
and
though
there
were
days
when
the
lifted
there
was
no
day
on
which
the
sea
was
calm
enough
for
the
launching
of
their
small
boat
then
one
afternoon
came
change
the
warm
air
turned
chill
and
the
warm
rain
became
sleet
that
night
the
wind
backed
to
the
north
and
next
day
was
a
blizzard
of
snow
and
the
night
after
the
wind
fell
away
and
the
snow
ceased
and
orion
and
his
two
dogs
shone
huge
in
a
frosty
sky
and
fiona
woke
to
the
glories
of
a
scarlet
sunrise
on
a
great
field
of
white
we
must
hurry
daddy
she
said
it
perfectly
calm
it
a
pet
day
said
the
student
sniffing
the
air
it
wo
last
the
wind
backed
too
suddenly
but
it
all
right
till
sunset
directly
breakfast
was
over
they
launched
the
little
boat
and
started
the
snow
shone
white
in
the
sunshine
and
the
calm
sea
against
the
snow
was
as
blue
as
a
blue
lotus
but
the
shadows
on
the
snow
were
a
wonder
and
the
woven
complexity
of
their
colorings
would
have
taxed
every
hue
on
an
artist
palette
so
they
pulled
down
and
into
the
cave
at
whose
mouth
the
great
bluff
looked
barer
and
blacker
than
ever
against
the
world
whiteness
and
they
grounded
their
boat
and
climbed
the
rock
barrier
there
the
student
sat
down
and
filled
and
lit
his
pipe
this
is
as
far
as
i
can
go
he
said
if
i
mistake
not
you
will
find
that
they
have
opened
the
door
for
you
so
fiona
went
on
to
the
recess
where
the
urchin
had
found
the
doubloon
and
where
the
torch
had
been
smashed
in
her
father
hand
and
the
solid
wall
of
the
cliff
had
opened
and
there
was
an
archway
leading
into
the
black
vaulting
of
the
long
cave
behind
fiona
passed
through
into
the
darkness
and
the
darkness
parted
to
right
and
left
of
her
and
she
stood
again
in
the
fairy
ring
where
she
had
stood
on
all
hallows
but
how
changed
of
all
the
bright
throng
of
fairies
that
had
clustered
round
it
not
one
stood
there
the
circle
of
scarlet
toadstools
was
broken
down
and
shattered
as
though
by
a
great
storm
and
the
ring
itself
was
no
longer
grass
but
was
covered
deep
in
snow
of
all
the
things
she
had
seen
there
that
evening
only
one
remained
the
beryl
throne
still
stood
lonely
in
the
midst
of
the
bare
ring
and
on
the
throne
sat
the
king
of
the
fairies
his
face
rested
on
his
hand
as
though
he
were
deep
in
thought
his
eyes
were
looking
at
something
far
away
on
the
steps
of
the
throne
sat
the
chancellor
the
king
inseparable
friend
and
he
too
was
deep
in
thought
it
was
a
view
of
the
fairy
world
which
fiona
had
never
expected
the
king
must
have
heard
her
step
for
he
rose
from
his
throne
and
came
down
to
meet
her
have
you
come
for
your
treasure
fiona
he
said
and
she
said
i
have
come
because
you
asked
me
to
come
back
the
king
held
out
his
sceptre
to
her
and
again
the
mist
came
up
from
the
ground
and
enwrapped
the
beryl
throne
and
the
figures
of
the
king
and
the
chancellor
wavered
and
became
dim
before
her
they
the
king
and
the
chancellor
was
not
what
she
saw
so
dim
through
the
mist
the
figures
of
the
shepherd
who
had
helped
her
on
glenollisdal
and
his
black
collie
but
the
mist
was
wavering
again
about
them
and
again
all
was
a
blur
and
then
the
mist
suddenly
cleared
and
there
was
no
one
there
at
all
but
just
the
old
hawker
and
the
little
terrier
which
followed
him
so
you
were
the
king
of
the
fairies
all
the
time
said
fiona
all
the
time
said
the
old
man
gently
we
go
about
in
the
world
as
you
see
us
and
some
still
entertain
angels
unaware
have
you
come
for
your
treasure
fiona
and
this
time
fiona
answered
yes
you
have
earned
it
said
the
king
and
you
have
found
much
more
than
any
treasure
your
father
has
told
you
that
and
again
fiona
said
yes
i
can
not
really
give
you
your
treasure
said
the
king
for
you
have
it
already
i
think
you
have
had
it
all
the
time
but
you
did
not
know
but
now
you
have
learnt
what
is
it
asked
fiona
but
i
think
i
can
guess
now
it
is
the
spirit
of
the
island
which
you
love
said
the
king
and
which
henceforth
loves
you
you
have
spoken
face
to
face
with
bird
and
beast
and
with
the
beings
who
knew
and
loved
the
land
before
your
race
was
you
have
the
freedom
of
the
island
and
of
all
living
things
in
it
they
are
your
friends
forever
and
to
the
dead
in
its
graveyards
you
are
kin
all
that
is
there
has
passed
into
your
blood
the
old
lost
loves
the
old
impossible
loyalties
the
old
forgotten
heroisms
and
tendernesses
all
these
are
yours
and
yours
are
the
songs
that
were
sung
long
ago
and
the
tales
which
were
told
by
the
fireside
and
the
deeds
of
the
men
and
women
of
old
have
become
part
of
you
you
can
walk
now
through
the
crowded
city
and
never
know
it
for
the
wind
from
the
heather
will
be
about
you
where
you
go
you
can
stand
in
the
tumult
of
men
and
never
hear
them
for
round
you
will
be
the
silence
of
your
own
sea
that
is
the
treasure
of
the
isle
of
mist
the
island
has
given
you
of
its
soul
you
have
found
greater
things
already
you
will
find
greater
things
yet
again
but
such
as
it
is
it
is
the
best
gift
which
we
of
the
fairy
world
have
to
give
and
now
continued
the
king
you
will
not
see
us
again
and
i
will
take
back
the
bracelet
it
would
be
no
further
use
to
you
for
you
are
no
longer
a
child
you
are
too
old
for
fairyland
but
my
father
could
see
you
said
fiona
he
could
only
see
me
as
i
really
am
through
your
eyes
said
the
king
it
may
be
that
some
day
you
too
will
see
me
again
through
the
eyes
of
a
child
but
for
the
present
it
is
farewell
so
fiona
stooped
down
and
stroked
the
little
dog
who
looked
at
her
with
wistful
eyes
and
took
her
farewell
of
the
king
and
the
king
raised
his
hand
and
the
mist
rose
again
and
enwrapped
the
fairy
ring
and
those
in
it
and
fiona
walked
out
through
the
archway
into
the
cave
and
there
sat
the
student
on
the
rock
barrier
just
as
she
had
left
him
knocking
the
ashes
out
of
his
pipe
and
even
as
she
came
to
him
there
was
a
noise
behind
her
and
when
she
looked
round
it
was
to
see
the
archway
blocked
by
a
great
fall
of
rock
you
will
not
use
that
way
again
little
daughter
said
the
student
i
shall
not
use
any
way
again
now
daddy
she
said
i
am
too
old
but
oh
daddy
it
has
been
worth
it
then
they
launched
their
boat
and
paddled
slowly
out
of
the
cave
out
of
the
dark
into
daylight
and
before
them
lay
the
quiet
sea
bathed
in
the
winter
sun
and
the
