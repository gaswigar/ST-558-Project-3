preface
the
story
of
young
people
lives
is
not
complete
without
many
and
broad
glimpses
of
their
school
days
it
was
impossible
to
devote
the
space
to
this
recital
of
the
five
little
peppers
school
life
in
the
books
that
showed
their
growing
up
the
author
therefore
was
obliged
unwillingly
to
omit
all
the
daily
fun
and
study
and
growth
that
she
loving
them
as
if
they
were
real
children
before
her
eyes
saw
in
progress
so
she
packed
it
all
away
in
her
mind
ready
to
tell
to
all
those
young
people
who
also
loved
the
peppers
when
they
clamored
for
more
stories
about
them
just
what
polly
and
joel
and
david
did
in
their
merry
school
days
ben
never
got
as
much
schooling
as
the
others
for
he
insisted
on
getting
into
business
life
as
early
as
possible
in
order
the
sooner
to
begin
to
pay
grandpapa
king
back
for
all
his
kindness
but
jasper
and
percy
and
van
joined
the
peppers
at
school
and
a
right
merry
time
they
had
of
it
and
now
the
time
seems
ripe
to
accede
to
all
the
insistent
demands
from
those
who
love
the
five
little
peppers
that
this
record
of
their
school
days
should
be
given
so
here
it
is
just

they

gave

as
much
as

and
she
told

as
fast
as

something

never

so
we
had
a

and
sold

and
here
is
our
gift
there
stood
the
little
vase
presenting
as
brave
an
appearance
as
in
its
first
perfection
little
peppers
at
i
hard
times
for
joel
come
on
pepper
one
of
the
boys
rushed
down
the
dormitory
hall
giving
a
bang
on
joel
door
as
he
passed
all
right
said
joel
a
bit
crossly
i
coming
last
bell
came
back
on
the
wind
joel
threw
his
tennis
racket
on
the
bed
and
scowled
just
then
a
flaxen
head
peeped
in
and
two
big
eyes
stared
at
him
ugh
joel
took
one
look
off
with
you
jenkins
jenkins
withdrew
at
once
joel
jumped
up
and
slammed
the
door
hard
whirled
around
in
vexation
sprang
over
and
thrust
the
tennis
racket
under
the
bed
seized
a
book
and
plunged
off
taking
the
precaution
despite
his
hurry
to
shut
the
door
fast
behind
him
jenkins
stole
out
of
his
room
three
doors
beyond
and
as
the
hall
was
almost
deserted
about
this
hour
so
many
boys
being
in
recitation
he
had
nothing
to
do
but
tiptoe
down
to
joel
room
and
go
softly
in
hullo
a
voice
behind
made
him
skip
oh
berry
it
was
a
tone
of
relief
it
you
um
said
berry
what
up
now
jenk
he
tossed
back
his
head
while
a
smile
of
delight
ran
all
over
his
face
hush
come
here
jenk
had
him
now
within
joel
room
and
the
door
shut
we
have
fun
with
the
beggar
now
who
dave
dave
no
who
wants
to
haul
him
over
cried
jenk
in
scorn
you
are
a
flat
berry
if
you
think
that
well
you
are
a
flat
if
you
think
to
tackle
joe
declared
berry
with
the
air
and
tone
of
one
who
knows
better
let
him
alone
after
what
you
got
last
term
well
i
ai
going
to
let
him
alone
declared
jenk
angrily
and
flushing
all
up
to
his
shock
of
light
hair
and
i
gave
him
quite
as
good
as
he
gave
me
i
have
you
know
tom
beresford
hoh
hoh
tom
gave
a
howl
of
derision
and
slapped
his
knee
in
pure
delight
tell
that
to
the
marines
sonny
he
said
hush
old
fox
will
hear
you
be
still
ca
you
twitching
his
jacket
and
stop
your
noise
i
ca
help
it
you
say
such
very
funny
things
said
beresford
wiping
his
eyes
well
anyway
i
going
to
pay
him
up
this
term
declared
jenkins
decidedly
he
was
rushing
around
the
small
room
the
corners
devoted
to
david
being
neatness
itself
which
could
truthfully
be
said
of
quarters
i
after
his
new
tennis
racket
where
in
thunder
is
it
tossing
up
the
motley
array
of
balls
and
such
treasures
that
showed
on
their
surface
they
belonged
to
no
one
but
joel
great
scott
tom
cried
with
sudden
interest
and
coming
out
of
his
amusement
you
wo
find
it
saw
him
looking
at
it
just
now
before
he
went
to
class
cried
jenkins
plunging
around
the
room
where
is
the
thing
he
fumed
berry
gave
a
few
swift
glances
around
the
room
then
darted
over
to
the
end
of
one
of
the
small
beds
leaned
down
and
picked
out
from
underneath
the
article
in
question
oh
give
it
to
me
cried
jenk
flying
at
him
and
possessing
himself
of
the
treasure
it
mine
i
told
you
of
it
is
it
a
beauty
declared
berry
his
eyes
very
big
and
longing
ha
ha
ai
it
well
joe
wo
see
this
in
one
spell
jenkins
gave
it
a
swing
over
his
head
then
batted
his
knee
with
it
what
are
you
going
to
do
jenk
demanded
berry
presently
when
he
could
get
his
mind
off
from
the
racket
itself
do
ha
ha
who
says
i
ca
pay
the
beggar
back
grinned
jenk
hopping
all
over
the
room
and
knocking
into
things
generally
hush
hush
warned
berry
plunging
after
him
here
old
fox
which
brought
both
boys
up
breathless
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
she
gone
by
a
long
breath
of
relief
and
there
she
goes
down
the
stairs
finished
berry
sure
not
daring
to
breathe
but
clutching
the
racket
tightly
and
with
one
eye
on
berry
jenk
cried
again
in
a
loud
whisper
sure
berry
as
if
any
one
could
mistake
the
flap
of
those
on
the
stairs
said
berry
scornfully
well
look
out
of
the
window
suggested
jenk
suddenly
she
go
across
the
yard
maybe
so
berry
dashed
to
the
window
and
gave
one
look
there
she
sails
with
a
bottle
in
her
hand
going
over
to
south
the
other
dormitory
across
the
yard
most
likely
jones
has
the
colic
again
good
now
that
disposes
finely
of
old
fox
which
brought
him
back
to
the
subject
in
hand
the
disposal
of
joel
racket
give
me
that
he
said
hurrying
over
to
jenkins
no
you
do
said
that
individual
and
i
must
be
lively
before
old
fox
gets
back
with
that
he
rushed
out
of
the
room
if
you
do
give
me
that
racket
i
tell
on
you
cried
beresford
in
a
passion
flying
after
him
hush
jenk
turned
on
him
suddenly
and
gripped
him
fast
see
here
he
cried
in
a
suppressed
tone
and
curbing
his
anger
as
best
he
could
you
do
want
joe
to
go
into
that
match
this
afternoon
with
this
racket
he
shook
it
with
eager
angry
fingers
no
said
berry
without
stopping
to
think
i
do
well
then
you
better
keep
still
and
hold
your
tongue
advised
jenk
angrily
well
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
it
none
of
your
what
he
did
say
for
just
then
a
boy
flew
out
of
his
room
to
tear
down
the
long
hall
he
had
his
back
to
them
and
there
was
no
time
to
skip
back
into
jenkins
own
room
for
the
two
had
already
passed
it
one
wild
second
and
jenkins
thrust
the
racket
into
the
depths
of
the
housemaid
closet
close
at
hand
under
some
on
a
shelf
then
he
stuck
his
hands
in
his
pockets
hullo
the
boy
who
was
rushing
along
suddenly
turned
to
see
him
whistling
oh
jenk
is
that
you
see
here
where
your
cæsar
do
know
gone
up
the
spout
said
jenkins
carelessly
and
keeping
well
in
front
of
beresford
well
who
has
one
you
have
berry
he
turned
to
tom
anxiously
not
on
your
life
he
has
jenk
answered
for
him
botheration
ejaculated
the
boy
i
fifty
lines
to
do
else
shut
in
from
the
game
and
simmons
has
run
off
with
my
book
try
joe
pepper
room
he
in
math
recitation
said
jenk
suddenly
he
has
one
toppy
you
a
brick
toppy
flew
down
the
hall
and
bolted
into
joel
room
holy
moses
what
luck
he
prowl
for
an
hour
over
joe
duds
come
on
jenk
had
his
head
in
the
cupboard
and
his
fingers
almost
on
the
racket
when
toppy
voice
rang
dismally
down
the
hall
joe
must
have
taken
it
jenk
pulled
his
fingers
out
and
had
the
door
fast
and
was
quite
turned
away
from
the
dangerous
locality
well
i
do
know
what
you
do
toppy
he
said
controlling
his
dismay
enough
to
speak
run
down
and
skin
through
the
fellows
rooms
on
first
floor
oh
good
gracious
he
groaned
it
all
up
with
getting
it
now
as
a
swarm
of
boys
came
tumbling
over
the
stairs
so
he
mixed
with
them
laughing
and
talking
and
berry
melted
off
somewhere
and
no
one
had
time
to
think
a
syllable
of
anything
but
the
great
game
of
tennis
to
be
called
at
two
between
the
two
divisions
of
marks
boys
some
of
the
team
of
the
school
a
set
of
fellows
at
this
sport
and
terribly
hard
to
beat
were
going
to
be
visitors
so
there
was
unusual
excitement
what
up
pepper
a
howl
that
rose
above
every
other
sort
of
din
that
was
then
in
progress
came
from
joel
room
he
been
in
here
joel
plunged
out
of
the
doorway
tossing
his
black
curly
locks
that
were
always
his
bane
his
eyes
flashing
dangerously
say
where
jenk
he
been
in
my
room
he
cried
doubling
up
his
small
fists
what
is
it
cried
jenkins
making
as
if
just
coming
up
the
stairs
what
all
the
row
about
you
been
in
my
room
shouted
joel
in
a
loud
insistent
voice
and
taken
my
the
rest
was
lost
in
a
babel
of
voices
what
what
gone
joe
they
all
crowded
into
the
small
space
and
swarmed
all
over
the
room
my
racket
yelled
joel
wrathfully
jenk
has
got
it
he
better
give
it
up
quick
now
he
pushed
up
the
sleeves
of
his
tennis
shirt
and
squared
off
glaring
at
them
all
but
making
the
best
of
his
way
over
toward
jenk
that
individual
when
he
saw
him
coming
thought
it
better
to
get
behind
some
intervening
boys
everybody
huddled
against
everybody
else
and
it
was
impossible
to
get
at
the
truth
see
here
now
mother
fox
will
be
after
us
all
if
you
do
hush
up
called
one
boy
i
guess
she
coming
which
had
the
desired
effect
all
the
voices
died
down
except
joel
i
do
care
said
joel
wrathfully
i
wish
she
would
come
jenk
has
got
my
racket
he
saw
me
with
it
before
i
ran
to
math
and
now
gone
all
eyes
turned
to
jenkins
is
that
so
a
hands
pushed
him
into
the
centre
of
the
group
then
you
got
to
give
him
fits
pepper
i
going
to
announced
joel
pushing
up
his
sleeves
higher
yet
until
he
tells
where
it
is
come
on
jenk
he
tossed
his
head
like
a
young
lion
and
squared
off
i
have
your
old
racket
declared
jenk
a
white
line
beginning
to
come
around
his
mouth
it
was
pleasant
to
see
his
reckoning
quite
so
near
then
you
know
where
it
is
declared
joel
and
give
it
to
the
beggar
cried
several
of
the
boys
with
whom
jenkins
was
by
no
means
a
favorite
give
it
to
him
worse
than
you
did
last
term
joe
called
some
one
on
the
edge
of
the
circle
closing
around
the
two
i
going
to
nodded
joel
every
nerve
in
his
body
tingling
to
begin
come
on
jenk
if
you
wo
tell
where
you
put
my
racket
he
afraid
said
the
boy
who
had
advised
the
more
severe
pommelling
old
jenkins
his
knees
knocking
together
miserably
but
with
a
wild
rage
in
his
heart
at
these
words
struck
out
blindly
to
meet
joel
sturdy
little
fists
and
to
find
his
waterloo
in
the
midst
of
the
din
and
confusion
that
this
encounter
produced
steps
that
could
never
by
any
possibility
be
mistaken
for
those
of
a
schoolboy
struck
upon
their
ears
the
circle
of
spectators
flew
wide
and
before
joel
and
jenkins
realized
what
was
coming
a
good
two
dozen
hands
were
laid
on
their
collars
and
they
were
dragged
apart
and
hauled
into
separate
rooms
the
rest
of
the
boys
scattering
successfully
tom
beresford
fled
with
the
rest
and
the
long
hall
was
cleared
boys
the
voice
of
the
matron
fox
rang
down
the
deserted
long
hall
as
she
looked
up
from
the
stairway
humph
they
are
quiet
enough
now
she
gave
a
restful
sigh
and
went
down
again
jones
and
his
colic
were
just
so
much
extra
on
a
terribly
busy
day
what
did
you
fellows
touch
me
for
roared
joel
lifting
a
bloody
nose
in
his
own
room
jenkins
was
in
that
state
that
recognizes
any
interruption
as
a
blessing
old
fox
would
have
caught
you
if
we
had
rushed
you
both
cried
the
boys
tom
beresford
worked
his
way
up
to
say
close
to
joel
ear
speak
get
into
your
room
i
tell
you
where
it
is
then
melted
off
to
the
outer
circle
of
boys
joel
looked
up
gave
a
little
nod
then
broke
away
from
the
boys
and
dashed
to
jenkins
door
see
here
he
flung
the
words
out
you
got
to
finish
sometime
when
fox
is
round
jenkins
who
was
under
the
impression
that
he
had
had
quite
enough
was
made
to
say
all
right
something
in
the
boys
faces
making
it
seem
imperative
that
he
should
do
so
quite
pleased
joel
withdrew
as
suddenly
as
he
had
come
meanwhile
up
the
stairs
two
at
a
time
came
davie
singing
at
the
memory
of
the
special
commendation
given
by
his
instructor
in
the
recitation
just
over
and
secretly
david
heart
bounded
with
a
wild
hope
of
taking
home
a
prize
in
classics
for
mamsie
everything
just
beautiful
this
term
he
hummed
to
himself
and
then
in
a
breathing
space
he
was
in
his
room
and
there
well
drawn
behind
the
door
was
a
boy
with
big
eyes
he
warned
what
the
matter
asked
david
in
astonishment
and
where
joel
oh

up
in

and

the

with
a
clap
and
then
came
to
stand
over
him
letting
the
whole
information
out
with
a
rush
he
pitched
into
jenk
and
they
had
a
fight
and
they
all
blood
and
the
old
fox
almost
got
both
then
he
shut
his
mouth
suddenly
the
whole
being
told
davie
put
both
hands
to
his
head
for
a
minute
everything
turned
dark
around
him
then
he
thought
of
mamsie
oh
dear
me
he
said
coming
to
how
i
wish
he
had
it
all
out
with
that
beggar
exploded
bates
longingly
david
did
say
anything
being
just
then
without
words
at
this
instant
joel
rushed
in
with
his
bloody
nose
and
a
torn
sleeve
where
jenk
in
his
desperation
had
gripped
it
fast
oh
joel
screamed
davie
at
sight
of
him
and
springing
from
his
are

oh
joey

joel
running
over
to
the
and
plunging
his
head
in
to
come
up
bright
and
smiling

dave
i
all
right
he
announced
his
black
eyes
shining
but
he

he
concluded
angrily
to

new
racket

david

joel
but

then
the
door
opened
cautiously
enough
to
admit
a
head
speak
pepper
but
come
joel
flung
down
the
towel
and
pranced
to
the
door

one

the
boy
to
whom
the
head
belonged
not
me
asked
david
longingly
ca
i
come

but
joe
joel
rushed
over
the
sill
tumultuously
deserting
david
and
the
bates
boy
do
speak
a
single
word
said
the
boy
out
in
the
hall
putting
his
mouth
close
to
joel
ear
but
move
lively
no
need
to
tell
him
so
in
a
minute
they
were
both
before
the
housemaid
closet
feel
under
whispered
the
boy
with
a
sharp
eye
down
the
length
of
the
hall
joel
brown
hands
pawed
among
the
and
brushes
bringing
up
in
a
trice
the
racket
grandpapa
gift
to
flourish
it
high
take
care

it
down
said
the
boy
in
a
hurried
whisper
oh
oh
cried
joel
hanging
to
it
in
a
transport
um
the
boy
nodded
hush
be
still
now
skip
for
your
room
beresford
said
joel
his
black
eyes
shining
as
he
paused
a
breathing
space
before
rushing
back
to
davie
the
new
racket
gripped
fast
if
i
do
pay
jenk
for
this
do
tom
grinned
all
over
his
face
in
great
delight
you
be
a
public
benefactor
and
he
softly
beat
his
hands
together
ii
the
tennis
match
joel
hugging
his
recovered
tennis
racket
rushed
off
to
the
court
tom
beresford
staring
out
of
his
window
paused
while
pulling
on
his
sweater
to
see
him
go
a
sorry
little
feeling
at
his
heart
after
all
at
joe
good
spirits
he
play
like
the
mischief
and
a
great
deal
better
for
the
row
and
the
fright
over
that
old
racket
well
i
had
to
tell
have
been
too
mean
for
anything
to
have
kept
still
so
he
smothered
a
sigh
and
got
into
his
togs
seized
his
implements
of
battle
and
dashed
off
too
streams
of
boys
were
rushing
down
to
the
court
and
the
yard
was
black
with
them
in
the
best
places
were
the
visitors
royalty
could
have
held
stronger
claims
to
distinction
in
the
eyes
of
marks
boys
and
many
were
the
anxious
glances
sent
over
at
the
four
andrew
boys
if
the
playing
should
come
up
to
the
usual
high
mark
pepper
will
score
high
one
after
another
said
as
he
dropped
to
the
ground
next
to
his
chums
in
the
circle
around
the
court
of
course
nobody
seemed
to
doubt
joel
powers
along
that
line
he
always
does
and
cries
of
pepper
pepper
were
taken
up
and
resounded
over
the
yard
joel
heard
it
as
he
dashed
along
and
he
held
his
head
high
well
pleased
but
david
followed
his
every
movement
with
anxiety
i
afraid
he
was
hurt
he
said
to
himself
and
if
he
should
lose
the
game
never
get
over
it
oh
dear
me
if
mamsie
could
only
be
here
but
mamsie
was
far
away
from
her
boys
whom
she
had
put
at
school
for
the
very
purpose
of
achieving
and
obedience
to
the
training
of
the
little
brown
house
so
davie
smothering
his
longing
got
into
a
front
row
with
several
boys
of
his
set
and
bent
all
his
attention
to
the
game
just
beginning
sharp
at
two
the
four
went
on
to
the
court
joel
and
fred
ricketson
against
tom
beresford
and
lawrence
greene
otherwise
larry
and
amid
howls
of
support
from
the
rooters
the
game
began
at
first
joel
luck
seemed
to
desert
him
and
he
played
wild
causing
much
consternation
in
the
ranks
violently
rooting
for
him
david
head
sank
and
he
leaned
his
elbows
on
his
knees
to
bury
his
hot
cheeks
in
his
hands
wake
up
cried
paul
sykes
his
very
particular
friend
hoarsely
giving
him
a
dig
in
the
ribs
do
collapse
dave
oh
groaned
david
his
head
sinking
lower
yet
i
ca
look
i
simply
ca
it
will
kill
joel
stiffen
up
cried
paul
joe
all
right
he
come
to
a
shout
stunning
at
first
that
finally
bore
down
all
before
it
in
the
shape
of
opposing
enthusiasm
swept
over
the
whole
yard
screams
of
applause
perfectly
deafening
rent
the
air
and
look
even
the
visitors
from
andrew
are
leaping
to
their
feet
and
yelling
good
good
something
quite
out
of
the
common
even
in
a
close
tennis
match
was
taking
place
david
shuddered
and
crouched
down
on
the
ground
as
far
as
he
could
paul
gave
him
an
awful
whack
on
the
back
you
losing
it
all
he
cried
as
he
stood
on
his
tiptoes
hi
hi
tippety
rippety
hi
hi
it
was
joel
especial
yell
and
there
he
was
as
david
scrambled
up
to
see
him
head
thrown
back
and
black
eyes
shining
in
the
way
they
always
did
when
he
worked
for
mamsie
and
polly
and
that
dealt
despair
to
all
opponents
he
had
just
made
a
brilliant
stroke
returning
one
of
swiftest
balls
in
such
a
manner
that
it
just
skimmed
over
the
net
and
passed
the
boys
before
they
could
recover
themselves
and
fairly
taking
off
from
their
feet
the
andrew
men
who
had
been
misled
by
previous
slow
playing
in
the
first
set
which
tom
and
larry
had
won
who
is
he
gee
whiz
but
that
good
form
declared
vincent
parry
the
andrew
champion
excitedly
pepper
do
you
know
pepper
cried
a
dozen
throats
trying
to
seem
unconscious
that
it
was
parry
the
champion
who
was
asking
the
question
oh
is
that
pepper
said
the
andrew
boy
while
pepper
pepper
hi
hi
tippety
rippety
hi
hi
rolled
out
till
there
was
any
other
sound
to
be
heard
and
a
regular
tussle
of
boys
were
getting
in
the
wildest
excitement
when
it
was
announced
that
pepper
and
ricketson
had
won
the
second
set
the
referees
trying
to
quiet
them
so
that
the
game
could
proceed
in
the
third
set
joel
seemed
to
have
it
all
his
own
way
and
fairly
swept
ricketson
along
with
him
the
excitement
was
now
so
intense
that
the
boys
forgot
to
yell
afraid
they
would
miss
some
strokes
david
clenched
his
hands
tightly
the
net
and
flying
balls
spun
all
together
inextricably
before
his
eyes
as
he
strained
them
to
see
brilliant
returns
this
was
the
deciding
set
as
the
cup
was
to
go
to
the
winners
of
two
sets
out
of
three
joel
last
serve
was
what
finished
it
the
ball
flashing
by
tom
with
such
impetus
that
even
the
andrew
champion
said
he
could
ever
have
returned
it
everybody
drew
a
long
breath
and
then
the
crowd
rushed
and
converged
to
joel
surrounded
him
fighting
for
first
place
the
fortunate
ones
tossing
him
up
to
their
shoulders
to
race
him
in
triumph
around
the
yard
take
ricket
screamed
joel
red
in
the
face
take
him
he
roared
he
beat
too
as
much
as
i
so
a
second
group
seized
fred
and
up
he
went
to
be
trotted
after
the
crowd
swarming
alongside
yelling
tumbling
over
each
other
gone
perfectly
wild
joe
waving
the
cup
thrust
into
his
hand
which
would
be
kept
by
the
winners
for
a
year
it
was
the
middle
of
the
night
davie
flushed
with
the
happiest
thoughts
had
peacefully
settled
to
dreams
in
which
mamsie
and
grandpapa
and
polly
and
jasper
and
all
the
dear
home
people
were
tangled
up
and
phronsie
seemed
to
be
waving
a
big
silver
cup
and
piping
out
with
a
glad
little
laugh
oh
i
am
so
glad
and
now
and
then
the
scene
of
operations
flew
off
to
the
little
brown
house
that
it
appeared
impossible
to
keep
quite
out
of
dreamland
some
one
gripped
him
by
the
arm
oh
what
is
it
joe
david
flew
up
to
a
sitting
posture
in
the
middle
of
his
bed
it
is
joe
get
up
as
quick
as
you
can
david
with
a
dreadful
feeling
at
his
heart
tumbled
out
of
bed
joe
he
found
time
to
say
with
a
glance
in
the
darkness
over
toward
joel
bed
hurry
up
do
stop
to
talk
the
voice
was
tom
beresford
get
on
your
clothes
meantime
he
was
scuffing
around
where
in
time
are
your
shoes
but
david
already
had
those
articles
and
was
pulling
them
on
with
hasty
fingers
oh
tell
me
he
could
help
crying
but
hurry
up
was
all
he
got
for
his
pains
and
at
last
after
what
seemed
an
age
to
tom
david
was
piloted
out
into
the
hall
with
many
adjurations
to
go
softly
down
the
long
flight
of
stairs
here
he
came
to
a
dead
stop
i
ca
go
another
single
step
tom
he
said
firmly
unless
you
tell
me
what
you
want
me
for
and
where
is
joel
he
gasped
oh
bother
in
another
minute
you
have
been
outside
and
then
it
would
be
safe
to
tell
you
said
tom
well
if
you
will
have
it
dave
joe
finishing
up
that
business
with
jenk
and
you
the
only
one
that
can
stop
it
now
do
keel
over
david
clung
to
the
door
which
tom
had
managed
to
open
softly
and
for
a
minute
it
looked
as
if
beresford
would
have
his
hands
full
without
in
the
least
benefiting
joel
but
suddenly
he
straightened
up
oh
tell
me
where
he
is
he
cried
in
a
manner
and
voice
exactly
like
polly
when
she
had
anything
that
must
be
done
set
before
her
and
clear
ahead
of
his
guide
when
tom
whispered
down
in
the
pine
grove
sped
davie
on
the
very
wings
of
the
wind
gracious
joel
is
nothing
to
dave
as
a
sprinter
said
tom
to
himself
as
his
long
legs
got
him
over
the
ground
in
the
rear
the
two
boys
hugged
the
shadow
of
the
tall
trees
and
dashed
across
the
lawn
to
the
shrubbery
beyond
then
it
was
but
a
breathing
space
and
a
few
good
leaps
to
the
depths
of
the
pine
grove
in
the
midst
of
this
were
two
figures
busily
engaged
in
the
cheerful
occupation
of
fisticuffing
each
other
till
the
stronger
might
win
called
david
hoarsely
his
breath
nearly
spent
as
he
dashed
up
joel
at
this
wavered
and
turned
seeing
which
his
antagonist
dealt
him
a
thwack
that
made
his
head
spin
and
nearly
lost
him
his
footing
that
was
mean
jenk
exclaimed
beresford
dashing
up
in
time
to
see
it
you
took
advantage
when
joe
was
off
guard
he
cried
hotly
no
such
thing
roared
jenk
losing
his
head
at
what
now
seemed
an
easy
victory
and
i
settle
with
you
when
i
get
through
with
joe
for
being
such
a
mean
sneak
as
to
turn
tom
all
right
said
tom
coolly
go
it
joe
and
pay
him
up
several
scores
to
settle
now
joel
gasped
davie
oh
mamsie
he
could
get
no
further
joel
hands
out
once
more
in
good
fighting
trim
wavered
again
and
sank
helplessly
down
to
his
side
oh
dear
tom
groaned
in
amazement
hoh
hoh
you
see
how
easy
i
could
whip
him
laughed
jenkins
raining
down
blows
all
over
joel
figure
who
did
offer
to
stir
see
here
you
tom
fairly
roared
it
out
perfectly
regardless
of
possible
detection
you
beastly
coward
and
he
jumped
in
between
joel
and
his
antagonist
you
may
settle
with
me
now
if
you
like
stop
tom
joel
seized
him
from
behind
tom
in
a
fury
turned
to
see
his
face
working
dreadfully
while
the
brown
hands
gripped
him
tightly
i
forgot
mamsie
would
like
you
must
tom
if
you
do
scream
for
john
he
declared
suddenly
john
the
watchman
being
the
last
person
whom
any
of
marks
boys
desired
to
see
when
engaged
in
a
midnight
prank
beresford
backed
away
slowly
from
jenkins
who
was
delighted
once
more
at
the
interruption
and
fastened
his
gaze
on
joel
well
i
never
did
pepper
he
brought
himself
to
say
tom
said
david
brokenly
and
getting
over
to
him
to
seize
his
hand
do
you
know
our
mamsie
would
feel
dreadfully
to
see
joel
doing
any
such
thing
oh
she
would
tom
as
beresford
continued
to
stare
without
a
word
not
to
such
a
miserable
beggar
tom
at
last
found
his
tongue
and
pointed
to
jenk
oh
yes
she
would
it
just
as
bad
in
joel
said
davie
shaking
his
head
joel
turned
suddenly
took
two
or
three
steps
then
flung
himself
down
flat
on
his
face
on
the
pine
needles
well
get
up
said
tom
crossly
running
over
to
him
john
will
maybe
get
over
here
we
made
so
much
noise
hurry
up
joe
we
must
all
get
back
joel
thus
adjured
especially
as
david
got
down
on
the
ground
to
put
his
arms
around
the
shaking
shoulders
got
up
slowly
then
they
turned
around
to
look
for
jenkins
he
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
little
coward
exclaimed
tom
between
his
teeth
well
we
have
to
skin
it
as
best
we
may
back
comes
john
they
could
see
his
lantern
moving
around
among
the
trees
and
dashing
off
taking
the
precaution
to
hug
the
shadow
of
the
trees
again
they
soon
made
the
big
door
to
the
dormitory
tom
reached
it
first
and
turned
the
knob
it
locked
he
said
the
mean
beastly
coward
has
locked
us
out
iii
a
narrow
escape
joel
in
such
an
emergency
wiped
his
black
eyes
and
looked
up
sharply
david
sank
on
the
upper
step
oh
no
tom
cried
joel
crowding
in
between
beresford
and
the
door
it
ca
be
get
out
of
the
way
let
me
try
it
is
it
is
i
tell
you
howled
tom
in
what
was
more
of
a
whine
as
he
kept
one
eye
out
for
john
and
his
lantern
the
mean
sneak
has
got
the
best
of
us
joe
he
set
his
teeth
hard
together
and
his
face
turned
white
joe
dropped
the
doorknob
and
whirled
off
the
steps
julius
cæsar
where
are
you
going
began
tom
as
joel
disappeared
around
the
corner
of
the
dormitory
he
gone
to
see
if
john
is
coming
i
suppose
said
davie
weakly
tom
preferring
to
see
for
himself
skipped
off
and
disappeared
around
the
angle
oh
oh
was
what
david
heard
next
making
him
fly
from
his
step
to
follow
in
haste
what
he
saw
was
so
much
worse
than
all
his
fears
as
tom
gripped
his
arm
pointing
up
over
his
head
that
he
screamed
right
out
oh
joe
come
back
you
be
killed
he
ca
come
back
said
tom
hoarsely
he
much
better
go
on
joel
more
than
halfway
up
the
lightning
conductor
was
making
good
time
shinning
along
he
turned
to
say
i
all
right
dave
as
a
window
above
them
was
thrown
up
and
a
head
in
a
white
nightcap
was
thrust
out
it
all
up
with
him
now
there
old
fox
groaned
tom
ducking
softly
back
over
the
grass
come
on
dave
but
david
with
clasped
hands
and
white
face
had
no
thought
of
deserting
joel
the
person
in
the
window
having
the
good
sense
to
utter
no
exclamation
waited
till
joel
was
up
far
enough
for
her
to
grasp
his
arm
then
she
could
help
it
as
she
saw
his
face
pepper
yes
said
joel
turning
his
chubby
face
toward
her
i
knew
i
could
get
up
here
it
just
as
easy
as
anything
fox
set
her
other
hand
to
the
task
of
helping
him
into
the
dimly
lighted
hall
much
to
joel
disgust
as
he
would
much
have
preferred
to
enter
unassisted
then
she
turned
her
full
on
him
and
said
in
a
tone
of
great
displeasure
what
the
meaning
of
all
this
why
i
had
to
go
out
mrs
fox
why
oh
i
i
had
to
she
did
ask
him
again
for
the
matron
was
a
woman
of
action
and
in
all
her
dealings
with
boys
had
certain
methods
by
which
she
brought
them
to
time
so
she
only
set
her
sharp
eyes
that
marks
pupils
always
called
gimlets
full
upon
him
go
to
your
room
was
all
she
said
oh
fox
cried
joel
trying
dreadfully
to
control
himself
and
twisting
his
brown
hands
in
the
effort
i
i
had
to
go
really
i
did
so
you
said
before
to
your
then
a
second
thought
struck
her
was
any
other
boy
with
you
she
demanded
suddenly
joel
gave
a
sharp
cry
of
distress
as
he
started
down
the
hall
revolving
in
his
mind
how
he
would
steal
down
and
unlock
the
door
as
soon
as
the
matron
had
taken
herself
off
here
stop
come
back
here
now
answer
me
yes
or
no
was
any
other
boy
with
you
as
joel
stood
before
her
again
joel
stubby
black
curls
dropped
so
that
she
could
see
his
face
as
there
was
no
reply
forthcoming
fox
took
him
by
the
arm
you
need
go
to
your
room
joel
she
said
sharply
you
may
go
to
coventry
oh
fox
joel
burst
out
do
do
send
me
there
a
boy
who
can
not
answer
me
is
fit
only
for
coventry
said
fox
with
great
dignity
despite
the
nightcap
wait
here
joel
i
will
get
my
candle
and
light
you
down
she
stepped
off
to
a
corner
of
the
hall
where
she
had
set
the
candlestick
on
a
table
when
startled
by
the
noise
outside
now
we
will
go
it
was
impossible
that
all
this
confusion
should
not
awake
some
of
the
boys
in
the
hall
and
by
this
time
there
was
much
turning
on
pillows
and
leaning
on
elbows
and
many
scuttlings
out
of
bed
to
listen
at
doors
opened
a
crack
so
that
nearly
every
one
of
the
occupants
on
that
particular
hall
soon
knew
that
old
fox
had
joel
pepper
in
her
clutches
and
that
he
was
being
led
off
somewhere
and
at
last
joel
let
it
out
himself
oh
fox
dear
fox
make
me
go
to
coventry
he
roared
he
clutched
her
wrapper
a
big
flowered
affair
that
she
wore
on
such
nocturnal
rambles
and
held
it
fast
i
be
just
as
good
he
implored
coventry
is
the
place
for
you
joel
pepper
said
fox
grimly
so
we
will
start
meanwhile
david
holding
his
breath
till
he
saw
in
the
dim
light
that
always
streamed
out
from
the
dormitory
hall
where
the
gas
was
left
turned
down
at
night
that
joel
was
safely
drawn
in
to
shelter
frantically
rushed
around
to
the
big
door
in
the
wild
hope
that
somehow
admittance
would
be
gained
joe
will
come
by
and
by
he
said
to
himself
sinking
down
on
the
steps
we
done
for
said
tom
voice
off
in
the
distance
oh
tom
are
you
there
cried
davie
straining
his
eyes
to
catch
a
glimpse
hush
tom
poked
his
head
out
from
a
clump
of
shrubbery
do
you
dare
to
breathe
i
tell
you
dave
our
only
hope
is
in
staying
here
till
morning
oh
dear
me
exclaimed
david
in
dismay
oh
dear
me
echoed
tom
in
derision
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
stop
talking
he
was
so
keyed
up
it
paradise
i
sure
compared
to
being
in
old
fox
grip
this
brought
david
back
to
joel
plight
and
he
sighed
dismally
and
leant
his
head
on
his
hands
how
long
he
sat
there
he
could
have
told
the
first
thing
he
did
know
a
big
hand
was
laid
on
his
shoulder
and
a
bright
glare
of
light
fell
full
on
his
face
oh
my
soul
and
body
cried
john
the
watchman
bending
over
him
if
here
ai
one
of
th
boys
dead
asleep
on
the
doorsteps
little
goose
to
sit
there
groaned
tom
huddling
back
into
his
bushes
now
it
all
up
with
him
well
i
save
my
skin
for
i
believe
those
boys
will
tell
on
me
coventry
was
a
small
square
room
in
the
extension
containing
a
bed
a
table
and
a
chair
where
the
boys
who
were
refractory
were
sent
it
was
considered
a
great
disgrace
to
be
its
inmate
they
were
not
locked
in
but
no
boy
once
put
there
was
ever
known
to
come
out
unless
bidden
by
the
authorities
and
no
one
of
course
could
speak
to
them
when
they
emerged
from
it
to
go
to
recitations
for
their
lessons
must
be
learned
in
the
silence
of
this
room
then
back
from
the
the
culprit
must
go
to
this
hated
place
to
stay
as
long
as
his
misdemeanor
might
seem
to
deserve
it
was
so
much
worse
punishment
than
a
flogging
could
possibly
be
that
all
marks
boys
heard
coventry
with
a
chill
that
stopped
many
a
prank
in
but
joel
did
get
into
coventry
after
all
for
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
another
was
advancing
and
back
of
it
was
the
thin
sharp
face
of
harrow
one
of
the
oh
harrow
screamed
joel
breaking
away
from
the
matron
to
plunge
up
to
him
she
going
to
put
me
into
coventry
oh
do
make
me
go
there
it
will
kill
my
mamsie
and
polly
hey
harrow
came
to
a
sudden
stop
and
whirled
the
candlestick
around
to
get
a
better
view
of
things
what
this
fox
and
of
all
boys
i
know
it
said
fox
her
candlestick
shaking
in
an
unsteady
hand
well
you
see
sir
i
was
going
upstairs
to
see
if
little
fosdick
had
blankets
enough
it
turned
cold
and
you
know
he
had
a
sore
throat
and
well
come
to
the
point
fox
said
the
teacher
bringing
her
up
quickly
joel
clung
desperately
to
his
hand
shaking
violently
in
every
limb
oh
yes
sir
well
and
i
heard
a
noise
outside
so
i
bethought
me
to
look
and
there
was
this
boy
climbing
up
the
lightning
conductor
up
the
lightning
conductor
echoed
harrow
yes
sir
fox
trembled
violently
as
she
nodded
joel
pepper
was
climbing
up
the
lightning
conductor
sir
and
i
thought
i
should
have
dropped
to
see
him
sir
the
turned
and
surveyed
joel
well
i
think
fox
he
said
slowly
if
he
been
over
that
lightning
conductor
we
wo
put
him
in
coventry
he
would
answer
when
i
asked
him
if
any
other
boys
were
there
said
the
matron
a
dull
red
spot
coming
on
either
cheek
that
bad
very
bad
said
harrow
well
i
take
joel
under
my
care
do
you
go
to
bed
mrs
fox
it
was
all
done
in
a
minute
somehow
fox
never
quite
realized
how
she
was
left
standing
alone
and
as
there
really
was
anything
else
for
her
to
do
she
concluded
to
take
the
advice
now
joel
harrow
looked
down
at
his
charge
you
seem
to
be
left
for
me
to
take
care
of
well
suppose
you
come
into
my
room
and
tell
me
something
about
this
affair
joel
with
his
heart
full
of
distress
about
david
and
tom
now
that
the
immediate
cause
of
alarm
over
his
being
put
into
coventry
was
gone
could
scarcely
conceal
his
dismay
as
he
followed
harrow
to
his
room
he
soon
found
himself
on
a
chair
and
the
setting
his
candlestick
down
took
an
opposite
one
do
you
mind
telling
me
all
about
this
little
affair
of
yours
joe
said
harrow
leading
off
easily
his
manner
once
away
from
the
presence
of
the
matron
was
as
different
as
possible
and
joel
who
had
never
met
him
in
just
this
way
stared
in
amazement
you
see
joe
the
went
on
and
he
began
to
play
with
some
pencils
on
the
table
it
is
so
very
long
ago
it
seems
to
me
since
i
was
a
boy
and
i
climbed
lightning
conductors
too
i
really
did
joel
joel
black
eyes
gathered
a
bright
gleam
in
their
midst
yes
and
at
night
too
said
the
softly
though
i
should
want
you
to
mention
it
to
the
boys
so
now
if
you
mind
joel
i
should
really
like
to
hear
all
about
this
business
of
yours
but
joel
twisted
his
hands
only
able
to
say
oh
dear
i
ca
tell
mr
harrow
his
distress
was
dreadful
to
see
well
said
the
slowly
perhaps
in
the
morning
feel
better
able
to
tell
i
wo
press
it
now
you
must
get
to
bed
joe
with
a
keen
look
at
his
face
oh
harrow
would
you
would
you
joel
jumped
out
of
his
seat
and
over
to
the
chair
would
i
what
asked
harrow
in
perplexity
wishing
very
much
that
mamsie
whom
he
had
seen
on
her
visits
to
the
school
were
there
at
that
identical
moment
would
you
oh
might
i
unlock
the
the
back
door
gasped
joel
his
black
eyes
very
big
with
distress
unlock
the
back
door
repeated
harrow
then
he
paused
a
moment
certainly
i
go
with
you
he
got
out
of
his
chair
oh
no
sir
cried
joel
tumbling
back
i
i
do
it
alone
if
i
may
please
sir
oh
no
joel
that
ca
ever
be
allowed
harrow
was
saying
decidedly
when
steps
were
heard
coming
down
the
hall
and
there
was
john
the
watchman
hauling
david
pepper
along
the
dimly
lighted
hall
to
the
extra
gleam
of
the
room
i
found
this
boy
asleep
on
the
steps
announced
john
coming
in
with
his
charge
why
david
pepper
exclaimed
harrow
in
astonishment
then
he
turned
a
cold
glance
on
joel
who
flew
over
to
davie
side
joel
cried
david
convulsively
and
blinking
dreadfully
as
he
came
into
the
light
oh
i
so
glad
you
safe
oh
so
glad
joey
he
hid
his
face
on
joel
arm
and
sobbed
you
may
go
john
said
the
to
that
individual
who
kept
saying
i
found
that
boy
asleep
on
the
steps
over
and
over
unable
to
stop
himself
and
do
say
anything
about
this
to
any
one
i
will
take
care
of
the
matter
all
right
sir
said
john
glad
to
be
relieved
of
all
responsibility
and
touching
his
cap
i
found
that
boy
asleep
on
the
steps
he
added
as
he
took
himself
off
now
see
here
harrow
laid
his
hand
on
david
shoulder
ignoring
joel
for
the
time
and
drew
him
aside
the
whole
of
this
business
must
be
laid
before
me
david
so
begin
oh
dave
cried
joel
springing
up
to
him
oh
sir
oh
harrow
it
was
all
my
fault
truly
it
was
david
only
came
after
me
oh
harrow
do
make
him
tell
you
go
and
sit
down
in
that
chair
joel
said
harrow
pointing
to
it
so
joel
went
and
got
on
it
twisting
miserably
now
then
david
you
see
said
david
the
tears
still
rolling
down
his
cheeks
that
oh
dear
joel
was
gone
and
how
did
you
know
joel
was
gone
interrupted
the
oh
dear
david
caught
his
breath
another
boy
told
me
sir
who
david
hesitated
must
i
tell
sir
not
trusting
himself
to
look
at
joel
certainly
tom
beresford
ugh
joel
sprang
from
his
chair
he
had
anything
to
do
with
it
sir
tom
has
been
awfully
good
he
only
told
dave
go
back
to
your
chair
joel
said
harrow
now
then
david
go
on
so
you
went
out
with
beresford
to
find
joel
eh
yes
sir
said
david
faintly
any
other
boy
asked
the
quickly
no
sir
well
then
tom
is
waiting
out
there
i
suppose
now
harrow
got
out
of
his
chair
he
did
have
anything
to
do
with
it
sir
cried
joel
wildly
and
flying
out
of
his
chair
again
truly
he
did
i
understand
harrow
nodded
i
going
to
bring
him
in
now
it
is
necessary
to
tell
you
two
boys
not
to
do
any
talking
while
gone
with
that
he
went
over
to
a
corner
took
down
a
lantern
lighted
it
and
passed
out
when
he
came
back
both
joel
and
david
knew
quite
well
by
tom
face
that
the
whole
story
was
out
and
joel
who
understood
as
well
as
any
one
that
floyd
jenkins
never
by
any
possibility
could
be
a
favorite
with
instructors
any
more
than
with
the
boys
unless
he
changed
his
whole
tactics
groaned
again
at
thought
that
he
had
made
matters
worse
for
him
now
all
three
of
you
scatter
to
bed
was
all
the
said
as
he
came
in
with
tom
no
talking
now
get
up
as
softly
as
you
can
good
night
iv
of
various
things
and
the
next
day
the
story
which
flew
all
over
the
yard
how
that
joel
pepper
was
put
into
coventry
last
night
was
overtaken
and
set
right
huh
there
now
you
see
cried
van
whitney
coming
out
of
his
rage
he
had
cried
so
that
his
eyes
were
all
swollen
up
and
he
was
a
sight
to
behold
percy
too
miserable
to
say
anything
and
wishing
he
could
ever
cry
when
he
felt
badly
had
slunk
out
of
sight
to
bear
the
trouble
as
well
as
he
might
now
he
came
up
bright
and
smiling
yes
now
you
see
he
cried
triumphantly
oh
i
hope
that
mean
beggar
jenk
will
be
expelled
there
appeared
to
be
but
one
voice
about
it
well
he
wo
said
van
wo
why
not
the
boys
crowded
around
him
on
the
playground
all
games
being
deserted
for
this
new
excitement
why
not
pray
tell
of
course
he
will
said
one
boy
decidedly
marks
never
keep
him
after
this
yes
he
will
too
roared
van
glad
he
could
tell
the
news
first
but
awfully
disappointed
that
it
must
be
that
jenkins
was
to
stay
for
joel
got
marks
to
promise
there
should
anything
be
done
to
jenk
so
there
now
what
not
after
locking
that
door
that
was
the
worst
the
boys
two
or
three
of
them
took
up
the
cry
was
beastly
mean
contemptible
just
like
jenk
went
all
over
the
playground
well
he
is
to
go
repeated
van
with
a
sigh
and
joel
says
he
was
as
bad
because
he
went
out
at
night
to
fight
why
he
had
to
jenk
dared
him
and
he
could
have
it
out
in
the
dormitory
you
know
he
could
whitney
said
one
of
the
boys
in
surprise
oh
dear
i
know
said
van
helplessly
well
joel
says
it
no
matter
that
the
racket
was
stolen
out
of
his
room
and
no
matter
ejaculated
the
boys
a
whole
crowd
of
them
swarming
around
him
well
if
that
is
oh
joel
afraid
that
marks
will
expel
jenk
percy
very
uncomfortable
to
have
joel
blamed
made
haste
to
say
do
you
see
well
he
ought
to
be
turned
out
declared
one
boy
decidedly
never
mind
we
make
it
so
hot
for
that
jenk
he
want
to
go
no
you
must
declared
percy
now
very
much
alarmed
oh
no
you
must
hobbs
because
if
you
do
joel
wo
like
it
oh
he
be
so
angry
he
wo
like
it
a
bit
i
tell
you
he
kept
saying
the
idea
of
joel
not
liking
it
seemed
to
take
all
the
fun
out
of
the
thing
so
hobbs
found
himself
saying
well
all
right
i
suppose
got
to
put
up
with
the
fellow
then
but
you
know
yourself
whitney
a
mean
cad
there
seemed
to
be
but
one
opinion
about
that
but
the
fact
remained
that
jenkins
was
still
to
be
one
of
them
to
be
treated
as
well
as
they
could
manage
and
for
the
next
few
days
joel
had
awfully
hard
work
to
be
for
all
the
crowd
and
the
boy
who
had
made
it
hard
for
him
you
have
to
help
me
out
tom
he
said
more
than
once
in
despair
pretty
hard
lines
said
tom
then
the
color
flew
all
over
his
face
i
suppose
i
really
ought
for
you
know
pepper
i
told
you
i
wanted
at
first
that
you
should
lose
your
racket
never
mind
that
now
tom
said
joel
brightly
and
sticking
out
his
brown
hand
you
been
awfully
good
ever
since
had
to
grunted
tom
hanging
to
the
hand
when
i
saw
how
mean
the
beggar
was
and
but
for
you
i
should
never
have
found
the
racket
at
least
not
in
time
joel
shivered
remembering
the
close
call
he
had
had
from
losing
the
game
tom
shivered
too
but
for
a
different
cause
if
i
had
told
him
always
have
hated
myself
he
thought
well
joe
i
would
after
this
give
away
a
racket
now
you
see
if
you
had
bestowed
your
old
one
on
that
ragamuffin
in
town
you
have
been
in
such
a
scrape
tom
tried
to
turn
it
off
lightly
oh
that
made
no
difference
joel
made
haste
to
say
i
could
have
borrowed
another
but
i
got
used
to
my
new
one
besides
grandpapa
sent
it
to
me
to
practise
with
for
this
game
and
i
really
could
have
done
so
well
without
it
yes
i
know
i
know
said
tom
remorsefully
and
that
what
jenk
knew
too
the
beggar
well
it
all
over
now
said
joel
merrily
so
say
no
more
about
it
but
it
was
all
over
with
jenkins
and
he
resolved
within
himself
to
pay
joel
pepper
up
sometime
after
the
boys
had
forgotten
a
little
about
this
last
exploit
if
they
ever
did
and
that
afternoon
joel
staid
in
foregoing
all
the
charms
of
a
ball
game
to
write
mamsie
a
complete
account
of
the
affair
making
light
of
the
other
boys
part
in
it
and
praising
up
tom
beresford
to
the
skies
and
oh
mamsie
joel
wrote
over
and
over
dave
did
have
anything
to
do
with
it
truly
he
did
and
harrow
is
just
bully
he
wrote
then
scratched
it
out
although
it
mussed
the
letter
up
dreadfully
he
fine
he
is
and
oh
i
like
marks
ever
so
much
i
do
till
fisher
had
a
tolerably
good
idea
of
the
whole
thing
i
not
sorry
adoniram
she
said
after
fisher
had
read
the
letter
at
least
twice
and
then
looked
over
his
spectacles
at
her
keenly
that
i
agreed
with
king
that
it
was
best
that
the
boys
should
go
away
to
school
now
any
other
woman
exclaimed
the
little
doctor
admiringly
would
have
whimpered
right
out
and
carried
on
dreadfully
at
the
least
sign
of
trouble
coming
to
her
boy
no
i
not
a
bit
sorry
repeated
fisher
firmly
for
it
going
to
be
the
making
of
joel
to
teach
him
to
take
care
of
himself
and
trust
him
anywhere
she
added
proudly
so
you
may
so
you
may
my
dear
declared
the
little
doctor
gaily
and
i
guess
if
the
truth
were
told
that
joel
part
in
this
whole
scrape
has
been
such
a
very
bad
one
after
all
which
came
to
be
the
general
view
when
marks
letter
arrived
and
one
from
the
followed
setting
things
in
the
right
light
and
although
old
king
was
for
going
off
directly
to
interview
the
master
with
several
separate
and
distinct
complaints
and
criticisms
he
was
at
last
persuaded
to
give
up
the
trip
and
let
matters
work
their
course
under
the
proper
guidance
at
the
school
so
polly
my
child
he
said
on
the
following
day
when
the
letters
were
all
in
i
believe
i
trust
marks
after
all
to
settle
the
affair
he
seems
a
very
good
sort
of
a
man
on
the
whole
and
i
really
suppose
he
knows
what
to
do
with
a
lot
of
boys
though
goodness
me
how
he
can
passes
my
comprehension
so
i
am
not
going
oh
grandpapa
exclaimed
polly
the
color
flooding
her
cheek
and
she
seized
his
hand
in
a
glad
little
way
yes
i
really
see
no
necessity
for
going
went
on
the
old
gentleman
much
as
if
he
were
being
urged
out
of
his
way
to
set
forth
so
i
shall
stay
at
home
joel
can
take
care
of
himself
i
trust
him
anywhere
he
brought
up
using
the
same
words
that
mother
fisher
had
employed
would
you
grandpapa
cried
polly
with
sparkling
eyes
and
clinging
to
him
yes
polly
my
child
said
grandpapa
emphatically
because
no
matter
into
what
mischief
joe
may
get
he
always
owns
up
goodness
me
polly
that
boy
ca
go
very
far
wrong
with
such
a

oh

polly
all
in

same
breath

laughed
old
king
who
had
his
own
reasons
for
liking
alexia
that
the
way
you
always
do
trying
to
get
polly
pepper
away
when
we
are
having
a
good

little
puffs
with
her

quite
often
on
similar
occasions
the
girls
heard
it
with
the
air
of
an
old
acquaintance
and
straightened
their
coats
and
hats
and
pulled
themselves
into
shape
generally
oh
my
goodness
how
you
look
sally
your
hat

eye
alexia

sally
holding

jumped
off
from

step
and
began
to
peer
anxiously
around
in
the
dirt
all
the
girls
crowding
around
and
getting
dreadfully
in
the
way
what
pin
was

sally
asked
polly
poking
into
a
tuft
of
grass
beneath
the
steps
your
blue
one
no

my
best
one
oh

sally
looked
ready
to

and
turned
away
so
that
the

see
her
face
not
the

your

gave
you
sally

lucy
bennett
pointing
across

station
master
garden
where
four

busily
scratching

pocket
and
sally
wiped
up
her
face
and
cried
all
over
it
till
it
was
a
damp
little
wad
and
the
girls
poked
around
and
searched
frantically
and
alexia
one
eye
on

along
sally

up
to

knot
of
ribbon

with

working

silvia
cousin
the

to

she
jingled

polly
pepper
with

and
you
my
very
dearest
friend
and
but
sally
had
such
a
fright
about
her
pin
said
polly
in
a
low
tone
alexia
was
crowded
up
close
and
hugging
her
arm
so
no
one
else
heard
well
that
old
pin
dropped
in
the
ribbon
she
had
it
herself
all
the
time
oh
dear
alexia
nearly
went
off
again
at
the
remembrance
she
felt
badly
all
the
same
said
polly
slowly
she
did
even
smile
and
alexia
could
feel
that
the
arm
was
slipping
away
from
her
oh
dear
me
she
began
then
she
dropped
polly
pepper
arm
sally

she
cried
suddenly
and
she
skipped
back
into
the
bunch
of
the
other
girls
polly
sent
her
an
approving
little
nod
and
she
did
fail
to
smile
now
alexia
ran
over
to
the
wagonette
and
hopped
in
not
daring
to
trust
herself
to
see
sally
moore
satisfaction
ahead
in
the
coveted
seat
the
other
girls
jumping
in
the
wagonette
was
soon
filled
and
away
they
spun
for
the
two
miles
over
to
the
hornes
beautiful
place
and
before
long
their
respects
having
been
paid
to
horne
the
whole
bevy
was
up
in
silvia
pretty
pink
and
white
room
overlooking
the
lake
i
think
it
just
too
lovely
for
anything
here
silvia
horne
exclaimed
sally
whose
spirits
were
quite
recovered
now
she
had
her
aunt
pin
all
safe
and
she
had
ridden
up
next
to
polly
oh
girls
she
has
a
new
pincushion
and
cover
yes
a
whole
new
set
said
silvia
carelessly
as
the
girls
rushed
over
from
the
bed
where
they
were
laying
their
things
to
see
this
new
acquisition
to
the
beautiful
room
well
if
i
could
have
such
perfectly
exquisite
things
breathed
alexia
as
they
all
and
over
the
pink
ribbons
and
dainty
lace
be
the
very
happiest
girl
kathleen
briggs
thrust
her
long
figure
in
among
the
bevy
that
toilet
set
is
very
pretty
she
said
indifferently
and
with
quite
a
air
very
pretty
repeated
alexia
turning
her
pale
eyes
upon
her
in
astonishment
well
i
should
think
it
was
it
too
perfectly
elegant
for
anything
oh
dear
me
kathleen
gave
a
little
laugh
it
just
nothing
to
the
one
i
have
on
my
toilet
table
at

oriental
lace
and

new
one

exclaimed
alexia
faintly
and
the
other
girls
fell
back
and
stared
respectfully

kathleen
delighted
at
the
effect
she
had
produced
we
start
and
we
do

she
jingled
her
bracelets
worse
than

they
come
to
bid

silvia
to
break
the
uncomfortable
silence
oh

polly
pepper
well
if

things

out
of
doors
proposed
silvia
suddenly
yes
do
let
the
girls
drew
a
long
breath
as
they
raced
off
i
think
that
kathleen
briggs
is
too
perfectly
horrid
for
anything
alexia
got
up
close
to
polly
as
they
flew
down
the
stairs
with
her
going
round
the
world
and
her
sniffing
at
toilet
set
hush
hush
whispered
polly
she

she
going

alexia
dashing
after
but

fast
she
grumbled
we
going
to
have
tea
out
on
the
lawn
announced
silvia
in
satisfaction
as
the
bevy
rushed
out
on
the
broad
west
piazza
the
maids
were
already
busily
setting
three
little
tables
that
were
growing
quite
pretty
under
their
hands

four
at

silvia
polly
going
to
sit
with
kathleen
and
me

one
other
girl

which
one

her
hands
together
in

there
alexia
rhys
she
cried
in
triumph
who

polly
pepper
now

alexia
much
discomfited
fell
back
well
i
think
that

great
way
to
give
a
party
she
said
to
get
up
a
fight
the
first
thing
but
silvia
and
kathleen
had
got
polly
pepper
one
on
each
side
and
were
now
racing
down
to
the
lake
we
going
to
have
a
sail
called
silvia
over
her
shoulder
so
they
all
followed
alexia
among
the
rest
with
no
time
for
anything
else
there
was
the
steam
launch
waiting
for
them
girls
girls
horne
called
to
them
from
the
library

into

on

silvia
trembled
she
very
much
wanted
something
from

the
world
so
she
put
her
arm
about
kathleen
oh

briggs
advanced
down
the
path
promise

begged

polly
pepper
imploringly
so
kathleen
promised
and
everything
became
quite
serene
just
in
time
for
and
briggs
to
have
the
girls
presented
to
them
and
then
they
all
jumped
into
the
steam
launch
and
the
men
sent
her
into
the
lake
and
everything
was
as
merry
as
could
be
under
the
circumstances
i
have
got
to
go
to

announced
silvia
when
they
were
well

that
too
fine
for

alexia
enviously

silvia

going
around
the
world
announced
briggs
she
was
just
like
kathleen
as
far
as
mother
and
daughter
could
be
and
she
had
more
jingling
things
on
besides
a
long
lace
scarf
that
was
catching
in
everything
and
she
carried
a
white
fluffy
parasol
in
her
hand
and
we
come
to
bid
to
our
relatives
before
we
start
kathleen
you
should
have
come
out
on
the
water
without
your
hat
for
the
first
time
noticing
her
daughter
bare
head

of
the
girls

hats
on
said
kathleen
shaking
her
long
light
braids
well
i
do
see
how
their
mothers
can
allow
it
exclaimed
briggs
glancing
around
on
the
group
but
i
let
you
kathleen
dear
me
you
will
ruin
your
skin
now
you
must
come
under
my
parasol
she
moved
up
on
the
seat
here

over
here
oh

kathleen
with
a
grimace
i
ca
see
anything
under
that
old
thing
besides
i
going
to
stay
with
the
girls
yes
you
must
come
under
my
parasol
a
frown
of
real
anxiety
settled
on
her
mother
face
you
thank
me
by
and
by
for
saving
your
complexion
for
you
kathleen
so

over
no

kathleen
hanging
back
and
holding
to
silvia
arm
there
your
veil

know
briggs
had
spoken
before
but
now
he
edged
up
to
his
wife
it
in
my
pocket
so

cried
his
wife
joyfully
as
briggs
pulled
out
a
long
green
tissue
veil

had
you

it
now
kathleen

me
and

hat
as
i
always

so
kathleen
not
daring
to
hold
back
from
this
command
but
grumbling
at
every
bit
of
the
process
tied
on
the
veil
and
then
sat
up
very
cross
and
stiff
through
the
rest
of
the
sail
i
should
rather
never
go
around
the
world
if
i
got
to
be
tied
up
like
an
old
green
mummy
every
step
alexia
managed
to
whisper
in
polly
ear
as
they
hopped
out
of
the
launch
and
she
was
very
sweet
to
kathleen
after
that
pitying
her
dreadfully
vi
the
accident
oh
dear
me
exclaimed
clem
they

lucy

echoing

alexia
and
how

black
silk

poor
child
cried
alexia
exulting
that
she
never

gathered
into

anstice
class
and
that
she
just
hated
art
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
despite
the
efforts
of
miss
salisbury
younger
sister
to
get
her
interested
yes

black
silk
gown

surely
be
there
look

with
a
sigh
how
i
do
wish

into
that
class
well
you
know
i
told
you
said
alexia
provokingly
you
much
better
have
taken
my
advice
and
kept
out
of
her
clutches
i
wish
i
had
mourned
amy
again
how
miss
anstice
can
be
so
horrid
she
is
a
bit
like
miss
salisbury
said
alexia

polly
oh

anyway
when
she
has
company
and

on
that
black
silk
gown
just
as
stiff
and
cross
and
perky
and
horrid
as
can
be
she
wants
you
all
to
show

said
alexia
well
i

of

just
dote
on

the
life
out
of
her
almost
said
sally
ca
help

alexia
sweetly
i
very
fond
of
her
and
as
for
mademoiselle
she
a
dear
oh
i
love
mademoiselle
too
well
she
does
love
you
cried
clem
viciously
dear
me
fancy
one
of
the
teachers
being
fond
of
alexia
oh
you
need
laugh
said
alexia
composedly
as
the
girls
giggled
every
single
one
of
those
teachers
would
feel
dreadfully
if
i
left
that
school
they
would
really
and
cry
their
eyes
out
and
tear
their
hair
i
suppose
said
clem
scornfully
yes
and
tear
their
why
what
in
this
world
are
we
stopping
for
cried
alexia
in
one
breath
so
everybody
else
wondered
as
the
train
gradually
slackened
speed
and
came
to
a
standstill
everybody
who
was
going
in
to
town
to
the
theatre
or
opera
began
to
look
impatient
at
once
oh
dear
cried
the
girls
who
were
going
to
sit
up
to
study
now
this
just
as
hateful
as
it
can
be
i
do
care
said
alexia
settling
comfortably
back
because
i
study
much
anyway
so
i
just
as
soon
sit
on
this
old
train
an
hour
oh
alexia
exclaimed
polly
in
dismay
with
her
heart
full
at
the
thought
of
mamsie
distress
and
that
of
dear
grandpapa
and
jasper
phronsie
would
be
abed
anyway
by
the
time
the
early
train
was
in
so
she
could
worry
but
all
the
others
oh
dear
me
she
gasped
do
look
so
polly
said
alexia
we
start
pretty
soon
i
guess
the
governess
miss
baker
came
over
from
the
opposite
seat
to
stand
in
the
aisle
i
think
we
start
soon
she
said
but
her
eyes
looked
worried
what
is
it
oh
miss
baker
what
is
the
reason
we
stopping
cried
two
or
three
of
the
girls
i
do
know
said
the
governess
a
man
coming
in
from
outside
where
a
lot
of
gentlemen
were
pouring
out
of
the
cars
to
investigate
furnished
the
information
driving
wheel
broken
he
said
being
sparing
of
words
oh
ca

go
out
to
see
cried
alexia
hopping
out
of
her
seat
come
on
and
she
was
prancing
down
the
aisle
no
indeed
said
miss
baker
in
displeasure
and
do
you
come
directly
back
she
commanded
oh
dear
me
grumbled
alexia
to
sally
who
had
tumbled
out
after
her
she
worse
than
miss
anstice
stiff
precise
old
thing
she
came
slowly
back
that
a
young
lady
under
my
care
said
miss
baker
lifting
her
black
gloves
in
amazement
should
so
far
forget
herself
as
to
want
to
run
out
on
that
track
with
a
lot
of
men
i
astonished
there
a
girl
out
there
said
alexia
sinking
into
her
seat
crossly
and
peering
over
polly
pepper
head
and
there
another
proclaimed
sally
triumphantly
well
if
they
forgotten
themselves
so
far
as
to
go
out
there
under
such
circumstances
i
shall
not
let
any
young
lady
in
my
care
do
it
said
miss
baker
emphatically
so
swallowing
their
disappointment
at
not
being
allowed
to
see
all
that
presented
itself
the
girls
settled
back
and
made
themselves
as
comfortable
as
possible

almost
everybody

poured
out
of
their
car
but
it
seemed
to
polly
pepper
as
if
she
never
could
keep
still
in
all
this
world
and
she
clasped
her
hands
tightly
together
and
hoped
nobody
would
speak
to
her
just
yet
polly
alexia
gave
a
little
push
as
she
leaned

alexia
in
astonishment
and
falling
back
and
i
wish

cried
polly
quite
aghast
at
herself
but
unable
to
stop
oh

alexia
kept
saying
quite
faintly
and
rolling
her
eyes
well
i
glad

once
said
clem
who
never
could
forgive
alexia
for

and

quite
still
just
then
polly

and
saw
her
face
oh
alexia
she
cried
flying
at
her
when
an
awful
bump
and
then
another
much
worse
and
then
a
grinding
noise
perfectly
terrible
and
everybody
who
was
left
in
the
car
went
tumbling
out
of
their
seats
oh
we
run
into
screamed
half
a
dozen
of
the
girls

who
had
been
standing
in
the
aisle

down
in
a
heap
on
the
floor
oh

her
arms
around
alexia
and
was
hugging
her
tightly

they
wriggled
out
of
the
bunch
of
girls
into
which
they
had
been
precipitated
up
to
their
feet
n
no
alexia
tried
to
say
instead
she
wobbled
over
and
laid
her
head
on
polly
arm
girls
girls
miss
baker
called
polly
not
seeing
that
lady
in
the
confusion
of
the
other
passengers
staggering
along
the
aisle
her
bonnet
knocked
over
her
eyes
and
a
girl
on
either
hand
to
help
her
along
clem
oh
somebody
help
me
alexia
is

but
nobody
heard
in
the
general
tumult

with
distress
and
to
think

so
cross
to
her
and
she
turned
quite
white
dear

alexia
she
cried
and
because
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
she
leaned
over
and
dropped
a
kiss
on
alexia
long
face
and
two
tears
dropped
down
as
well
alexia
opened
her
eyes
that
very
nice
polly
she
said
do
so
some
more
are
you
ashamed
cried
polly
the
rosy
color
coming
back
to
her
cheek
and
then
remembering
she
hugged
alexia
tightly
oh

so
glad

alexia
so
very
glad
she
cried
gratefully
ow
exclaimed
alexia
shrinking
back
oh
now

are
hurt
cried
polly
oh
alexia
and
she
turned
very
white
again
tell
me
where
it
is
and
just
then
some
of
the
girls
rushed
up
with
the
news
corroborated
by
the
other
passengers
that
the
down
express
had
run
into
them
been
signalled
but
could
stop
in
time
till
polly
thought
she
should
go
wild
before
the
babel
could
be
stopped
do
crowd
around
so
she
cried
hoarsely
alexia
is
hurt
alexia
the
noise
as
far
as
miss
salisbury
girls
were
concerned
stopped
at
once
and
at
last
the
other
passengers
were
made
to
understand
how
it
was
and
alexia
quite
faint
now
but
having
sense
enough
to
hang
to
polly
pepper
hand
was
laid
across
an
improvised
bed
made
of
two
seats
and
a
doctor
who
happened
to
be
on
the
train
one
of
the
party
going
in
to
the
theatre
came
up
and
looked
her
over
professionally
it
my
arm
said
alexia
opening
her
eyes
again
it
was
doubled
up
someway
under
me
oh
dear
me
i
so
silly
to
faint
you
not
silly
at
all
cried
polly
warmly
and
holding
her
well
hand
while
her
eyes
searched
the
doctor
face
anxiously
oh
is
it
broken
they
asked
as
plainly
as
possible
not
a
bit
of
it
said
the
doctor
cheerfully
feeling
it
all
over
again
to
make
quite
sure
while
alexia
set
her
teeth
together
trying
not
to
show
how
very
much
it
hurt
it
badly
strained
the
ligaments
are
but
fortunately
no
bones
are
broken
oh
dear
groaned
alexia
now
why
ca
it
be
broken
oh
alexia
cried
polly
and
now
the
tears
that
had
been
kept
back
were
rolling
down
her
cheeks
i
so
happy
i
ca
help
it
she
said
and
the
very
idea
alexia
rhys
exclaimed
clem
to
wish
your
arm
had
been
broken
and
she
gave
a
little
shiver
it
hurts
just
as
much
said
alexia
trying
to
sit
up
straight
and
making
an
awful
face
so
it
might
as
well
be
and
i
never
been
in
a
railroad
accident
but
a
sprained
arm
is
anything
to
show
any
baby
can
have
that
oh
dear
me
well
you
better
lie
still
counselled
miss
baker
tartly
dear
me
i
little
thought
when
i
took
charge
of
you
young
ladies
that
any
such
thing
would
occur
she
acts
as
if
she
thought
we
did
it
on
purpose
said
alexia
turning
her
face
over
to
hide
it
on
polly
arm
again
and
wishing
her
own
need
ache
so
dreadfully
oh
dear
such
a
time
as
we
had
polly
pepper
with
those
dreadful
briggses

and

day
and
study

you
alexia
and

all
well
again

to
talk
now
dear
and
she
patted
the
poor
cheeks
and
smoothed
her
hair
all
the
while
she
was
trying
to
keep
down
the
worry
over
the
who
would
be
thrown
into
the
greatest
distress
she
knew
if
news
of
the
accident
should
reach
their
ears
ca
somebody
telephone
them
she
cried
oh

doctor

hastened
to
add

frightened
none
of
the
passengers
now
i
know
he
was
brave
and
trying
to
do
something
to
save
us
cried
polly
with
kindling
eyes
yes
said
a
passenger
coming
up
to
their
group
he
was
running
back
with
a
lantern
to
signal
the
train
and
he
slipped
and
fell
and
the
express
went
over
him
but
it
stopped
just
in
time
for
us
oh
the
poor
poor
man
polly
was
quite
gone
by
this
time
and
alexia
forgot
her
pain
in
trying
to
comfort
her
but

polly
just

and
held

i
wo

the
governess
who

vexation
plainly
written
all
over
her
face

said
the
governess
stepping
off
after
her
very
well
said
polly
going
swiftly
down
the
aisle
to
see
below
the
car
steps
a
crowd
of
passengers
all
in
a
tumult
and
vociferating
angrily
in
the
midst
of
them
polly
saw
the
face
of
the
doctor
who
had
just
fixed
alexia
arm
oh
sir
she
began
he
looked
up
and
caught
sight
of
the
brown
eyes
is
the
little
girl
worse
and
he
sprang
over
toward
her
polly
not
stopping
to
think
how
furious
alexia
would
be
who
was
quite
the
tallest
of
their
set
to
be
designated
as
a
little
girl
made
haste
to
say
oh
no
sir
but
oh
could
you
tell
me
how
to
let
my
grandpapa
and
my
mother
know
we
are
safe
could
you
sir
poor
polly
who
had
held
up
so
bravely
was
clasping
her
hands
tightly
together
and
the
brown
eyes
were
full
of
tears
well
you
see
began
the
doctor
hating
to
disappoint
her
it
a
difficult
matter
to
get
in
communication
with
them
at
once
we
are
only
five
miles
out
but
five
miles
echoed
polly
oh

cried
polly
happily
to
the
station
myself
sir
and
she
began
to
clamber
down
the
car
steps
come
back
commanded
the
governess
lifting
her
hands
in
horror
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
the
very
idea
what
would
your
grandfather
king
say
to
such
a
thing
polly
pepper
mr
who
cried
the
doctor
stay
little
girl
seizing
her
arm
mr
who
he
demanded
looking
up
to
the
governess
on
the
car
steps
horatio
king
she
replied
with
asperity
and
you
better
be
occupied
with
something
else
let
me
tell
you
sir
instead
of
encouraging
his
granddaughter
to
run
off
on
such
a
errand
as
this
i
certainly
shall
take
pleasure
in
performing
the
errand
myself
he
said
now
polly
i
send
the
message
do
you
worry
and
he
sped
off
down
the
track
vii
the
salisbury
girls
and
then
somebody
rushed
in
saying
we
another
locomotive
now
we
going
and
everybody
else
who
was
outside
hurried
into
the
cars
the
new
propelling
power
was
attached
to
the
other
end
of
the
train
and
after
a
deal
of
switching
there
they
were
at
last
off
on
the
way
home
polly
gave
a
long
breath
of
relief
and
clasped
alexia
hand
closely
oh
by
this
time
they
know
at
home
it
all
right
she
cried
the
doctor
came
smilingly
down
the
aisle
well
he
nodded
to
polly
yes

all

he
said
i
must
really
call

a
time
yes

fortunate

to
meet

now
then
how

little
friend

he
leaned
over
and
touched
alexia
arm
lightly
oh

all
right
she
said
that
good
in
a
gratified
tone
now
keep
plucky
and
you
get
out
of
this
finely
then
he
sat
down
on
the
arm
of
the
seat
and
told
such
a
funny
story
that
no
one
supposed
it
could
be
the
home
station
when
the
train
came
to
a
standstill
and
he
was
helping
alexia
out
there
now
drop
polly
hand
if

the

alexia
hanging
to
it
for
dear
life

want

presume
so
laughed
the
doctor
but
i
think
it
best
for
me
to
help
you
miss
baker
and
all
the
girls
crowded
up
in
a
bunch
easy
there
he
said
do
hurry
so
there
plenty
of
time
and
he
got
between
them
and
alexia
lame
arm
and
there
down
by
the
car
steps
polly
could
see
him
as
he
waited
for
the
stream
of
passengers
to
get
out
was
jasper
his
eyes
eagerly
searching
every
face
with
an
impatience
scarcely
to
be
controlled
and
back
of
him
were
fisher
big
glasses
shining
as
the
little
doctor
pranced
back
and
forth
unable
to
keep
still
there
they
are
there
they
are
polly
exclaimed
oh
if
we
could
hurry
and
let
them
know
we
all
right
but
they
were
wedged
in
so
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
take
their
turn
and
let
the
passengers
in
front
descend
jasper
oh
papa
fisher
at
last
polly
was
out
on
the
platform
where
she
stood
on
her
tiptoes
and
waved
her
hand
are
you
all
right
asked
jasper
eagerly
craning
his
neck
to
see
for
himself
yes
yes
cried
polly
and
then
presently
they
had
her
on
either
hand
oh
help
alexia
she
cried
turning
back
fisher
took
one
look
through
his
big
glasses
well
well
pennell
he
exclaimed
you
here
and
he
skipped
over
to
them
i
really
believe
so
laughed
pennell
dear
me
little
fisher
glanced
at
alexia
quickly
nothing
but
sprained
the
other
doctor
said
quickly
still
it
needs
careful
attention
and
then
it
came
out
that
alexia
aunt
had
heard
a
chance
word
dropped
about
the
accident
and
had
run
down
to
king
in
her
distress
so
she
was
there
awaiting
them
and
the
fathers
and
brothers
of
the
rest
of
the
salisbury
girls
took
off
their
charges
much
to
the
relief
of
the
governess
so
presently
jasper
had
his
party
all
settled
in
the
carriage
pennell
saying
well
i
resign
my
responsibility
about
that
arm
to
you
dr
fisher
he
lifted
his
hat

jasper
as
she
sped
down
through
the
streams
of
people
pouring
along
the
platform
to
thread
her
way
after
the
tall
figure
jasper
by
her
side
pennell
oh

the
doctor
pulled
up
in
his
brisk
walk
oh

breath

said
the
doctor
gravely
oh

exclaimed
polly
with
a
sorry
droop
to
the
bright
head
and
clasping
her
hands
could
you
pennell
tell
me
anything
more
that
all

the
doctor

doubt
of

pennell
said
abruptly

i
maybe

for
him
jasper
shivered
and
laid
hold
of
polly
arm
well

the
doctor
cheerily
and
look
out
for

the
thing
over
so
polly
and
jasper
raced
back
again
down
over
the
platform
clambered
into
the
carriage
and
away
they
went
home
to
grandpapa
and
mamsie
and
alexia
and
her
aunt
staid
all
night
and
after
the
whole
story
had
been
gone
over
and
over
and
grandpapa
had
held
polly
on
his
knee
all
the
time
she
was
not
in
mamsie
lap
and
alexia
had
had
her
poor
arm
taken
care
of
and
all
bandaged
up
fisher
praising
her
for
being
so
cool
and
patient
why
then
it
was
nearly
eleven
dear
me
polly
cried
mother
fisher
in
dismay
looking
over
at
the
clock
they
were
all
in
the
library
and
all
visitors
had
been
denied
the
very
idea
you
children
must
get
to

yes
or

wo
be
cool
and
patient
said
fisher
decidedly
and
patting
alexia
bandages

run
off
little
girl
and
we
see
you
bright
as
a
button
in
the
morning
i
not
cool
and
patient
declared
alexia
abruptly
pulling
down
with
her
well
hand
the
little
doctor
till
she
could
whisper
in
his
ear
oh
aunt
does
fuss
so
you
ca
think
i
a
raging
wild
animal
well
you
have
been
raging
alexia
said
the
little
doctor
bursting
out
into
a
laugh
oh
hush
do
implored
alexia
who
was
in
the
slightest
degree
afraid
to
speak
her
mind
least
of
all
to
fisher
whom
she
liked
immensely
they
all
hear
us
she
brought
up
in
terror
what
is
it
alexia
cried
her
aunt
from
the
sofa
where
fisher
had
asked
her
to
be
seated
as
it
was
well
across
the
room
oh
is
she
worse
she
exclaimed
hurrying
over
nervously
there
now
you
see
cried
alexia
tragically
and
sinking
back
in
her
chair
everything
just
as
bad
as
can
be
now
not
in
the
least
miss
rhys
the
little
doctor
said
in
his
cheeriest
tones
only
alexia
and
i
had
a
little
joke
all
by
ourselves
and
as
he
waited
coolly
for
the
maiden
lady
to
return
to
her
seat
she
soon
found
herself
back
there
then
he
went
over
to
mamsie
and
said
something
in
a
low
tone
yes
adoniram
mother
fisher
nodded
over
polly
brown
head
she
ought
to
have
a
good
night
sleep
polly
said
fisher
leaning
over
her
it
just
this
that
aunt
of
alexia
she
a
good
enough
sort
of
a
woman
i
suppose
wrinkling
his
brows
in
perplexity
to
find
the
right
words
but
she
certainly
does
possess
the
faculty
to
rile
folks
up
remarkably
well
she
sets
my
teeth
on
edge
she
does
really
wife
he
brought
out
this
confession
honestly
although
he
hated
professionally
to
say
it
and
alexia
well
you
know
polly
she
ought
to
be
kept
quiet
so
your
mother
and
i
we
do
do
we
dear
taking
mamsie
hand
we
certainly
do
said
fisher
not
waiting
for
the
whole
story
to
be
told
think
it
best
for
you
to
have
alexia
with
you
oh
goody
exclaimed
polly
sitting
quite
straight
in
mamsie
lap
you
are
not
to
talk
polly
you
know
said
fisher
decidedly
oh
we
wo
we
wo
promised
polly
faithfully
you
can
have
the
red
room
polly
said
mamsie
because
of
the
two
beds
and
now
child
you
must
both
hop
off
and
get
into
them
as
soon
as
you
can
or
you
be
sick
so
polly
ran
off
to
bid
grandpapa
good
night
and
then
as
he
held
her
in
his
arms
he
said
well
now
polly

and
jasper
and
i
will
take
that
trip
down
to
the
railroad
station
oh
grandpapa
cried
polly
clasping
her
hands
while

turned
rosy
red
i
am
so
very
glad

after

an

school
to

thought
of

day
or
two
perhaps

in
the
morning
father
jasper
hurried
to
say
at
sight
of
polly
face
oh

shall

polly
flashed
a
bright
glance
at
him
grandpapa

such
trouble

he
added
with
decision
polly
brown
head
drooped
despite
her
efforts
to
look
bravely
up
into
his
face
good
night
grandpapa
she
said
sadly
and
was
turning
away
oh
bless

exclaimed
old
king
hastily
polly

we

tell
then
whether

best
for
you
to
go
to
school
or
not
come
kiss
me
good
night
again
so
polly
ran
back
and
gave
him
two
or
three
kisses
and
then
raced
off
jasper
having
time
to
whisper
at
the
door
i
most
know
polly
father

you
go
i
really

truly
believe
he

too
cried
polly
happily
and
sure
enough
he
did
for
the
next
morning
polly
ran
down
to
breakfast
as
merry
as
a
bee
brown
eyes
dancing
as
if
accidents
were
never
to
be
thought
of
and
grandpapa
pinched
her
rosy
cheek
and
said
well
polly
you
won
off
with
you
to
school
and
polly
tucked
her
books
under
her
arm
and
raced
off
with
jasper
who
always
went
to
school
with
her
as
far
as
their
paths
went
turning
off
at
the
corner
where
she
hurried
off
to
miss
salisbury
select
school
to
go
to
his
own
oh
here
comes
polly
pepper
the
girls
some
of
them
waiting
for
her
at
the
big
iron
gate
raced
down
to
meet
her
oh
polly
polly
at
that
a
group
of
girls
on
the
steps
turned
and
came
flying
up
too
oh

all
about
the
awful
accident
they
screamed
tell

they
swarmed
all
over

books
and
one
girl
seized
them
i
carry

for

and
polly
not

of
the
other
girls
that

silvia

either
oh

and
well
i

declared
leslie
fyle
i
ca
abide
that
silvia
horne
nor
i
said
another
girl
she
so
full
of
her
airs
and
graces
and
always
talking
about
her
fine
place
at
edgewood
oh
dear
me
i
sick
of
edgewood
a
little
disagreeable
laugh
went
around
oh
i
tell
you
of
the
accident
said
polly
come
let
sit
down
on
the
steps
we
ten
minutes
yet
yes
do
do
cried
the
girls
so
they
huddled
up
together
on
the
big
stone
steps
polly
in
the
middle
and
she
told
them
the
whole
story
as
fast
as
she
could
meantime
other
girls
hurrying
to
school
saw
them
from
a
distance
and
broke
into
a
run
to
get
there
in
time
and
polly
gave
alexia
love
all
round
as
she
had
been
commissioned
to
do
we
go
up
to
your
house
to
see
her
cried
leslie
perhaps
this
afternoon
oh
no
you
must
said
polly
i
dreadfully
sorry
girls
but
papa
fisher
says
no
one
must
come
yet
till
he
sends
word
by
me
i
thought
you
said
alexia
was
all
right
and
if
her
arm
is
broken
i
should
think
we
might
see
her
said
a
big
girl
on
the
edge
of
the
circle
discontentedly
she
had
private
reasons
for
wishing
the
interview
as
soon
as
possible
as
she
and
alexia
had
quarrelled
the
day
before
and
now
it
was
quite
best
to
ignore
all
differences
and
make
it
up
but
she
had
a
great
strain
and
says
it
is
best
repeated
polly
very
distinctly
so
we
ca
even
think
of
it
sarah
polly
is
that
polly
pepper
exclaimed
a
voice
in
the
hall
illustration
and
she
told
them
the
whole
story
as
fast
as
she
could
oh
yes
miss
anstice
cried
polly
hopping
up
so
quickly
she
nearly
overthrew
some
of
the
bunch
of
girls
yes
she
had
on
the
black
silk
gown
and
polly
fancied
she
could
hear
it
crackle
it
was
so
stiff
as
miss
anstice
advanced
primly
i
hear
that
there
was
an
accident
polly
pepper
last
night
which
you
and
some
of
the
other
girls
were
in
now
why
did
you
not
come
and
tell
me
or
sister
at
once
about
it
oh
dear
me
do
forgive
me
cried
poor
polly
now
seeing
that
she
had
done
a
very
wrong
thing
not
to
have
acquainted
miss
salisbury
first
with
all
the
particulars
i
do
hope
you
will
forgive
me
miss
anstice
she
begged
over
again
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
overlook
it
polly
said
miss
anstice
who
was
much
disturbed
by
the
note
she
held
in
her
hand
just
delivered
by
which
professor
mills
informed
her
he
should
be
unable
to
deliver
his
address
that
morning
before
her
art
class
so
she
added
with
asperity
it
would
have
been
quite
the
proper
thing
and
something
that
would
naturally
i
should
suppose
suggest
itself
to
a
girl
brought
up
as
you
have
been
polly
to
come
at
once
to
the
head
of
the
school
with
the
information
polly
feeling
that
all
this
reflected
on
mamsie
and
her
home
training
had
yet
nothing
to
do
but
to
stand
pale
and
quiet
on
the
steps
she
could
help
it
the
big
girl
pushed
her
way
into
the
inner
circle
we
girls
all
just
made
her
stop
my
miss
anstice
it
was
just
a
mob
here
when
we
saw
polly
coming
sarah
miller
you
have
nothing
to
say
until
i
address
you
a
little
red
spot
was
coming
on
either
cheek
as
miss
anstice
turned
angrily
to
the
big
girl
and
i
shall
at
once
report
you
to
sister
for
improper
behavior
oh
dear
dear
well
i
wish
would
fire
old
black
silk
exclaimed
a
girl
on
the
edge
of
the
circle
under
her
breath
look
at
her
now
is
she
a
terror
and
then
the
big
bell
rang
and
they
all
filed
in
now
she
wo
let
us
have
our
picnic
she
go
against
it
every
way
she
can
cried
a
girl
who
was
out
of
dangerous
earshot
and
the
terror
of
this
spread
as
they
all
scampered
down
the
hall
oh
dear
dear
to
think
this
should
have
happened
on
her
black
silk
day
no
we
wo
get
it
now
you
may
depend
cried
ever
so
many
and
poor
polly
with
all
this
added
woe
to
make
her
feel
responsible
for
the
horrible
beginning
of
the
day
sank
into
her
seat
and
leaned
her
head
on
her
desk
the
picnic
celebrated
as
an
annual
holiday
was
given
by
miss
salisbury
to
the
girls
if
all
had
gone
well
in
the
school
and
no
transgressions
of
rules
or
any
misdemeanor
marred
the
term
miss
anstice
never
had
looked
with
favor
on
the
institution
and
the
girls
always
felt
that
she
went
out
of
her
way
to
spy
possible
insubordination
among
the
scholars
so
they
strove
not
to
get
out
of
her
good
graces
observing
special
care
when
the
black
silk
days
came
around
on
this
unlucky
day
everything
seemed
against
them
and
as
miss
anstice
stalked
off
to
sit
upon
the
platform
by
sister
for
the
opening
exercises
the
girls
felt
it
was
all
up
with
them
and
a
general
gloom
fell
upon
the
long
schoolroom
miss
salisbury
gentle
face
was
turned
in
surprise
upon
them
as
she
scanned
the
faces
and
then
the
general
exercises
being
over
the
classes
were
called
and
she
and
sister
were
left
on
the
platform
alone
oh
now
she
getting
the
whole
thing
groaned
leslie
looking
back
from
the
hall
to
peer
in
old
black
silk
is
giving
it
to
her
oh
i
just
hate
miss
anstice
sarah
why
could
you
have
kept
still

another
girl

had
spoken

anstice

have
gotten
over
it
well
i
was
going
to
have
polly
pepper

said
sarah
sturdily
if
you
were
willing
to
i
was
going
to
stand
still
and
hear
it
when
it
was
our
fault
she
told
us
first
oh
no
sarah
said
polly
it
surely
was
my
own
self
that
was
to
blame
i
ought
to
have
run
in
and
told
miss
salisbury
first
well
now
girls

that
picnic
for

leslie
tragically
of
that
you
may
be
sure
polly
pepper
viii
we
to
have
our
picnic
and
that
afternoon
polly
kept
back
bad
recollections
of
the
gloomy
morning
at
school
as
well
as
she
could
she
did
let
alexia
get
the
least
bit
of
a
hint
about
it
although
how
she
ever
escaped
letting
her
find
it
out
she
never
could
quite
tell
but
rattled
on
all
the
messages
the
girls
had
sent
and
every
bit
of
school
news
she
could
think
of
were
the
other
girls
who
went
to
silvia
at
school
asked
alexia
suddenly
and
twitching
up
her
pillow
to
get
higher
in
bed
for
fisher
had
said
she
must
get
up
this
first
day
and
a
hard
piece
of
work
mother
fisher
had
had
to
keep
the
aunt
out
of
the
room
i
would
go
in
mamsie
would
say
fisher
does
wish
her
to
be
disturbed
miss
rhys
and
it
was
all
done
so
quietly
that
alexia
aunt
would
find
herself
off
down
in
the
library
again
and
busy
with
a
book
very
much
to
her
own
surprise
i
shake
up
polly
cried
and
hopping
off
from
the
foot
of
the
bed
she
thumped
the
pillows
if
not
with
a
merry
at
least
with
a
vigorous
hand
there
now
crowding
them
in
back
of
alexia
restless
head

that
fine
i
should
think
it
was
exclaimed
alexia
with
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
and
giving
her
long
figure
a
contented
stretch
you
do
know
just
the
best
things
to
do
polly
pepper

on
i
suppose
amy

is
perfectly
delighted
to

polly
that
brought
it
all
back
about

alexia
fell
to
laughing
so
that
she
notice
polly
face
at
all
but
her
aunt
popping
in
she
became
sober
at
once
and
ran
her
head
under

bedclothes
with
a
desperate
hand
and

she
said
with
great
satisfaction

said
alexia
as
polly
climbed
up
back
of
the
pillows
and
began
to
smooth
the
long
light
fluffs
of
hair
trying
to
do
it
just
as
mamsie
always
did
for
her
you
say
professor
mills
come
oh

and
think
of
that
black
silk
gown
wasted
on

cross
as
two
sticks
because
he
did
come

she
polly
oh

i
glad
i
was

she
hurried
on
not
waiting
for
a
reply
i
rather
be
in
with
this
old
bundle
she
patted
her
bandages
oh
polly
she
started
up
so
suddenly
that
the
brush
flew
out
of
polly
lap
and
spun
away
across
the
floor
take
care
said
polly
oh

the
comb
now
and
she
skipped
down
recovered
the
articles
and
jumped
up
to
her
post
again
what
is
it
alexia
why
i
just
thought
you
do

miss
salisbury
will
appoint
the
day
for
the
picnic
do
you
while
my
arm
is
lame
the
color
in
polly
cheeks
went
out
and
she
was
glad
that
she
could
get
well
behind
the
pillows
oh
no
alexia
she
made
herself
say
we
would
ever
in
all
this
world
have
the
picnic
till
you
were
well
how
could
you
think
it
alexia
i
did
believe
you
would
cried
alexia
much
gratified
and
huddling
down
again
without
once
seeing
polly
face
but
most
of
the
girls
do
care
about
me
polly
and
they
would
mind
oh
yes
they
do
said
polly
reassuringly
they
very
fond
of
you
most
of
them
are
well
said
alexia
i
not
fond
of
them
so
i
do
really
expect
them
to
be
polly
but
i
should
like
to
go
off
and
have
that
picnic
when
i
could
go
was
anything
said
about
it
polly
she
asked
abruptly
miss
salisbury
or
miss
anstice
did
say
a
word
said
polly
trembling
for
the
next
question
just
then
mother
fisher
looked
in
with
a
smile
polly
you
are
wanted
she
said
grandpapa
and
jasper
are
ready
to
go
to
the
railroad
station
i
going
to
stay
with
alexia
and
finish
her
hair
just
as
i
do
for
polly
alexia
looked
up
and
smiled
it
was
next
best
to
having
polly
to
have
fisher
so
polly
happy
to
have
a
respite
from
alexia
questions
about
the
picnic
and
happier
still
to
be
going
to
find
out
something
about
the
poor
brakeman
family
flew
off
from
the
bed
set
a
kiss
on
alexia
hot
cheek
and
another
on
mamsie
and
raced
off
i
coming
jasper
she
called
she
could
see
him
below
in
the
wide
hall
all
right
do
hurry
so
father
is
ready
yet
dear
me
polly
you
can
get
ready
so
quickly
for
things
he
said
admiringly
and
in
the
glow
of
starting
he
could
see
that
polly
spirits
seemed
at
a
low
ebb
and
he
drew
a
long
breath
as
he
tried
to
make
himself
believe
that
what
he
had
noticed
at
luncheon
was
really
so
at
all
and
polly
between
grandpapa
and
jasper
tried
to
make
them
have
such
a
good
time
that
really
it
seemed
no
walk
at
all
and
they
were
all
quite
surprised
when
they
found
themselves
there
we
must
go
up
into
the
superintendent
room
said
king
so
up
the
long
stairs
they
went
the
old
gentleman
grumbling
at
every
step
because
there
was
no
elevator
and
at
all
other
matters
and
things
that
were
as
he
declared
at
loose
ends
in
the
whole
system
at
last
they
stood
before
the
desk
have
the
goodness
began
old
king
to
the
official
a
short
pompous
person
who
came
up
in
the
absence
of
the
superintendent
and
now
turned
a
cold
face
up
to
them
to
give
me
some
information
regarding
a
brakeman
who
was
killed
last
night
in
the
accident
to
the
train
due
here
at
do
know
anything
about
him
said
the
official
in
the
crispest
accents
he
looked
as
if
he
cared
less
and
was
about
to
slam
down
the
window
when
king
asked
does
anybody
in
this
office
know
ca
say
the
official
pulled
out
his
watch
compared
it
with
the
big
clock
on
the
wall
then
turned
away
do
any
of
you
know
who
the
man
was
who
was
killed
last
night
asked
the
old
gentleman
putting
his
face
quite
close
to
the
window
and
speaking
in
such
clear
distinct
tones
that
every
clerk
looked
up
each
man
searched
all
the
other
faces
no
they
did
know
except
one
a
little
thin
person
over
in
the
corner
at
a
high
desk
copying
i
only
know
that
his
name
was
jim
he
said
in
a
voice
to
match
his
figure
have
the
goodness
to
step
this
way
sir
and
tell
me
what
you
do
know
said
king
in
such
a
way
that
the
little
man
but
with
many
glances
for
the
pompous
individual
slipped
off
from
his
high
stool
to
advance
to
the
window
rubbing
his
hands
together
deprecatingly
the
other
clerks
all
laid
down
their
pens
to
see
the
interview
what
was
his
name
this
brakeman
demanded
king
i
do
know
sir
said
the
little
thin
clerk
jim
that
was
all
i
knew
him
by
i
used
to
see
him
of
a
morning
when
i
was
coming
to
the
office
and
he
was
waiting
to
take
his
train
he
was
a
steady
fellow
jim
was
he
added
anxiously
scanning
the
handsome
face
beneath
the
white
hair
i
do
doubt
that
said
old
king
hastily
i
do
in
the
least
doubt
it
and
he
was
given
to
drink
sir
the
little
thin
clerk
cried
abruptly
although
some
did
say
it
who
should
for
there
were
many
after
jim
place
he
had
an
easy
run
and
yes
yes
well
now
what
i
want
to
know
said
king
interrupting
the
stream
polly
and
jasper
on
either
side
having
a
hard
time
to
control
their
impatience
is
where
this
as
you
call
him
lived
and
what
was
his
last
name
that
i
do
know
sir
said
the
little
thin
clerk
i
only
know
he
had
a
family
for
once
in
a
while
when
i
had
a
minute
to
spare
he
get
to
talking
about
when
we
met
jim
was
awful
fond
of
that
any
one
could
see
yes
well
now
what
would
he
say
asked
the
old
gentleman
trying
to
hurry
matters
along
the
pompous
official
had
his
eye
on
the
clock
it
might
go
hard
for
the
little
thin
clerk
in
his
seedy
coat
if
he
took
too
much
time
from
office
hours
why
he
had
one
girl
who
was
crazy
about
music
said
the
little
clerk
and
oh
dear
me
exclaimed
polly
old
king
heard
her
sigh
at
his
side
and
he
cried
well
what
else
why
i
heard
jim
say
once
he
live
on
bread
and
water
if
he
could
only
give
his
daughter
a
chance
and
there
were
his
three
boys
three
boys
echoed
king
sharply
yes
sir
i
saw
round
the
train
once
or
twice
they
were
likely
chaps
it
seemed
to
me
the
little
thin
clerk
a
bachelor
with
several
unmarried
sisters
on
his
hands
for
support
sighed
deeply
well
now
cried
king
thinking
it
quite
time
to
bring
the
interview
to
a
close
i
take
it
quite
kindly
if
you
find
out
for
me
all
you
can
about
this
jim
a
member
of
my
family
was
on
the
train
last
night
who
but
for
this
noble
brakeman
might
might
bless
me
there
is
my
card
the
old
gentleman
pulled
out
one
from
his
cardcase
then
fell
to
wiping
his
face
violently
what
is
your
name
asked
jasper
seeing
that
his
father
speak
hiram
potter
said
the
little
clerk
the
pompous
official
drew
near
and
looked
over
his
shoulder
at
the
card
oh
why
mr
king
he
cried
all
the
pomposity
suddenly
gone
i
beg
your
pardon
what

i
do
for
you
sir
nothing
whatever
sir
king
waved
him
away
well
now
potter

so
very
good
as
to

as
soon
as

it
up
to
my
house
i
be
very
much
indebted
to
you
with
a
bow
to
him
in
which
the
official
was
nowise
included
the
old
gentleman
and
polly
and
jasper
went
off
down
the
stairs
again
finkle
you
caught
this
time
you
in
a
hole
the
brother
officials
sang
out
when
the
card
had
been
displayed
around
the
office
i
would
want
to
be
in
your
shoes
said
more
than
one
finkle
tried
to
brave
out
the
dismay
he
felt
at
having
offended
the
powerful
millionaire
railroad
director
but
he
made
but
a
poor
show
of
it
meanwhile
the
little
thin
clerk
slipping
the
precious
card
into
his
seedy
coat
pocket
clambered
up
to
his
high
stool
his
mind
busy
with
plans
to
unearth
all
possible
information
concerning
jim
the
brakeman
as
soon
as
the
big
clock
up
on
the
wall
should
let
them
out
of
the
office
polly
my
dear
old
king
kept
saying
as
they
went
down
the
stairs
and
he
held
her
hand
very
closely
i
think
this
potter
a
very
good
sort
of
a
man
he
seems
to
be
too
will
find
out
all
we
want
to
know
about
jim
i
really
do
polly
so
we
wo
worry
about
it
child
nevertheless
on
top
of
all
the
rest
that
was
worrying
her
polly
had
a
sorry
enough
time
to
keep
her
troubles
from
showing
on
her
face
and
after
dinner
when
the
bell
pealed
violently
she
gave
a
great
start
and
turned
quite
pale
jasper
saw
it
i
do
believe
it
any
bad
news
polly
he
hastened
to
say
reassuringly
and
longing
to
comfort
though
he
could
imagine
the
reason
oh
where
polly
she
heard
the
girls
voices
out
in
the
hall
and
ran
out
to
meet
them
oh
dear
me
she
cried
at
sight
of
their
faces
that
confirmed
her
worst
fears
yes

polly
it
just
as

cried
leslie
fyle
precipitating
herself
against

cried
the
others
crowding
up
oh

cried
polly
standing
quite
still
and
feeling
as
if
she
never
could
hold
up
her
head
again
now
that
the
picnic
was
lost
through
her
i
shall
tell
myself
declared
sarah
bluntly
i
the
one
it
seems
that
made
all
the
trouble
so
it
really
belongs
to
me
i
should
think
to
be
the
first
speaker
polly
folded
her
hands
tightly
together
while
the
babel
went
on
feeling
that
if
she
did
hear
the
dreaded
news
soon
she
should
fly
off
to
mamsie
miss
salisbury
said
she
could
hear
little
scraps
of
chatter
i
know
oh
do
hurry
and
tell

just
think
miss
salisbury
and

then
some
of
them
looked
around
and
into
face
oh

goodness
girls

polly
pepper
with
that
they
all
rushed
at
her
and
nobody

out
together

out
their
heads
into
the
hall

the
bunch
of
salisbury
girls
to
plunge
up
to
him
with
shining
eyes
we
to
have
our
picnic
we
truly

jasper
and
i
thought

down

length
of
the
hall
it
a
person
to

he
cried
gaily
to
the
group
he
was
much
pleased
at
the
success
of
his
plan
to
find
out
about
the
brakeman
of
which
he
felt
quite
sure
from
the
appearance
so
promptly
of
the
little
clerk

something
quite
important

decidedly

brightly

since

picnic
and
then
she
put
her
hand
in
old
king
quite
bubbling
over
with
happiness
jasper
just
as
jubilant
since
polly
was
herself
again
on
the
other
side
to
go
in
and
meet
the
little
thin
clerk
scared
at
his
surroundings
and
perched
on
the
extreme
edge
of
a
library
chair
ix
all
about
the
poor
brakeman
potter
was
very
miserable
indeed
on
the
edge
of
his
chair
and
twirling
his
hat
dreadfully
and
for
the
first
moment
after
the
handsome
old
gentleman
spoke
to
him
he
had
nothing
to
say
old
king
was
asking
him
for
the
third
time
you
found
out
all
about
poor
jim
family
eh
at
last
he
emerged
from
his
fit
of
embarrassment
enough
to
reply
yes
sir
now
that
is
very
good
the
old
gentleman
cried
approvingly
and
wiped
his
face
vigorously
after
his
effort
very
good
indeed
mr
potter
hiram
potter
now
followed
up
his
first
attempt
to
find
his
voice
and
trying
to
forget
the
handsome
surroundings
that
had
so
abashed
him
he
went
on
now
quite
glibly
you
see
sir
there
six
of
jim
children
dear
me
ejaculated
old
king
yes
sir
there
are
potter
hat
began
to
twirl
uneasily
again
and
the
wife
she
ai
strong
just
got
up
from
rheumatic
fever
that
bad
very
bad
said
king
those
three
boys
of
his
are
good
said
potter
brightening
up
a
bit
in
the
general
gloom
and
the
biggest
one
says
he
going
to
be
a
brakeman
just
like
his
father
but
the
mother
wants
all
to
go
to
school
you
see
that
what
jim
was
working
for
and
the
girl
who
wanted
to
play
on
the
piano
broke
in
polly
eagerly
then
she
blushed
rosy
red
oh
forgive
me
grandpapa
for
interrupting
and
she
hid
her
face
on
old
king
arm
i
was
just
going
to
ask
about
that
girl
myself
said
grandpapa
promptly
tell
us
about
her
potter
if
you
please
hiram
potter
set
his
hat
carefully
on
the
floor
beside
his
chair
it
was
his
sunday
hat
and
evidently
that
with
his
best
clothes
which
he
had
donned
in
honor
of
the
occasion
were
objects
of
great
care
he
scratched
his
head
and
thought
deeply
well
now
you
see
sir
he
said
slowly
that
almost
a
hopeless
case
and
i
wish
as
sure
as
i
sit
here
that
girl
had
never
thought
of
piano
music
but
it
born
in
her
the
mother
said
the
girl
grandfather
was
a
musician
in
the
old
home
in
germany
and
so
she
ca
help
it
why
she
just
so
crazy
about
it
she
drum
all
up
and
down
the
kitchen
table
to
make
believe
that
oh
grandpapa
cried
polly
in
the
greatest
excitement
and
hopping
up
and
down
by
his
side
that
just
as
i
used
to
do
in
the
little
brown
house
the
very
same
way
grandpapa
you
know
yes
she
did
father
cried
jasper
bobbing
his
head
scarcely
less
excited
just
as
if
old
king
had
heard
the
story
many
times
potter
for
want
of
something
to
do
to
express
his
amazement
picked
up
his
hat
stroked
it
and
set
it
down
again
staring
with
all
his
might
so
you
did
polly
so
you
did
my
child
cried
grandpapa
taking
her
hands
in
both
of
his
and
looking
down
into
her
shining
eyes
well
well
to
be
sure
now
jasper
get
the
tablet
and
write
down
the
address
of
jim
family
as
quickly
as
you
can
my
boy
so
jasper
ran
over
to
the
library
table
and
brought
back
the
tablet
and
pencil
hanging
to
it
and
pretty
soon
jim
home
was
all
described
thus
james
corcoran
willow
court
third
house
from
haven
street
it
kinder
hard
to
find
observed
potter
slowly
because
willow
court
runs
into
haven
street
and
this
number
is
on
the
house
it
got
rubbed
off
but
if
you
follow
up
no
and
come
up
carefully
why
there
you
be
where
no
was
oh
dear
me
said
king
well
you
may
describe
the
house
for
i
am
going
down
there
and
i
certainly
do
not
wish
to
waste
my
time
walking
about
polly
and
jasper
looked
so
very
decidedly
oh
may
we
go
too
that
the
old
gentleman
added
quickly
and
my
young
people
will
accompany
me
which
really
left
nothing
more
to
be
desired
at
present
well
it
a
yellow
house
said
potter
thinking
very
hard
that
is
it
is
in
spots
where
the
paint
is
on
and
it
low
and
runs
down
to
the
back
and
sets
sideways
but
i
tell
you
how
you
know
it
got
jim
corcoran
has
the
greatest
lot
of
flowers
in
her
window
they
chock
full
sir
i
shall
know
it
then
cried
polly
in
great
satisfaction
i
think
there
no
danger
sir
but
what
we
will
find
the
place
all
right
old
king
was
fumbling
in
his
pocket
in
great
perplexity
it
never
would
do
he
decided
pulling
his
hand
out
no
i
must
contrive
to
send
him
something
well
now
hem
potter
he
said
aloud
and
where
do
you
live
quite
near
i
presume
oh
just
the
other
end
of
the
town
sir
said
potter
i
live
on
acorn
street
acorn
street
repeated
king
wrinkling
his
brows
and
where
may
that
be
pray
tell
it
over
at
the
south
end
sir
it
runs
off
from
baker
street
and
highland
square
oh
yes
yes
said
the
old
gentleman
without
much
more
idea
than
before
i
know
where
it
is
father
said
jasper
dear
me
you
had
to
take
a
good
bit
of
time
to
get
all
this
information
mr
potter
potter
looked
down
busily
on
the
carpet
trying
not
to
think
how
tired
his
feet
were
saving
some
for
their
owner
well
now
what
number
the
old
gentleman
seeming
to
desire
his
whole
address
that
was
soon
given
too
acorn
street
south
end
and
i
suppose
you
have
a
family
went
on
the
old
gentleman
determined
to
find
out
all
there
was
to
it
now
he
had
commenced
the
little
clerk
began
to
hem
and
to
haw
behind
his
hand
no
sir
i
have
that
is
yes
i
have
considerable
i
mean
my
four
sisters
sir
we
all
live
together
oh
ah
replied
king
well
now
thank
you
very
much
potter
and
as
your
time
is
valuable
and
should
be
paid
for
he
tucked
a
bill
within
the
nervous
hands
oh
i
could
take
it
sir
cried
hiram
potter
greatly
distressed
but
it
your
due
why
man
i
should
have
asked
you
to
take
all
this
trouble
and
spend
so
much
time
after
i
found
you
had
so
far
to
go
king
was
really
becoming
irate
now
so
that
the
little
clerk
did
dare
to
say
more
bless
me
say
no
more
say
no
more
the
little
clerk
was
too
much
frightened
to
think
of
another
word
and
finding
that
the
interview
was
considered
closed
he
picked
up
his
hat
and
in
some
way
he
could
never
remember
how
he
soon
found
himself
out
of
the
handsome
house
and
skipping
off
nimbly
in
the
fresh
air
which
quite
revived
him
i
could
offer
him
only
a
trifle
old
king
was
saying
only
what
might
repay
him
for
his
trouble
and
time
but
i
shall
speak
to
fraser
about
him
jasper
that
agent
of
mine
is
curiously
enough
in
want
of
a
clerk
just
at
this
time
and
i
know
this
little
man
can
fit
in
very
well
and
it
will
get
him
away
from
that
beastly
office
four
sisters
oh
my
goodness
well
fraser
must
give
him
enough
to
take
care
of
them
oh
how
fine
father
exclaimed
jasper
with
kindling
eyes
and
then
the
girl
that
wants
to
learn
to
play
on
the
piano
oh
dear
me
yes
old
king
burst
into
a
merry
laugh
i
must
look
after
that
little
girl
or
polly
wo
speak
to
me
i
am
afraid
will
you
polly
my
child
he
drew
her
close
to
him
and
kissed
her
blooming
cheek
i
am
so
very
glad
you
are
going
to
look
out
for
her
grandpapa
she
cried
because
you
know
i
did
feel
so
dreadfully
when
i
used
to
drum
on
the
table
in
the
little
brown
house
she
confessed
i
know
i
know
child
grandpapa
face
fell
badly
and
he
held
her
very
close
it
always
broke
him
up
to
hear
the
peppers
tell
of
the
hard
times
in
the
little
brown
house
and
polly
hastened
to
add
brightly
and
then
you
came
grandpapa
dear
and
you
made
it
all
just
beautiful
oh
grandpapa
and
she
clung
to
him
unable
to
say
more
yes
yes
so
i
did
so
i
did
cried
the
old
gentleman
delightedly
quite
happy
again
and
stroking
the
brown
hair
well
polly
my
girl
it
is
anything
to
the
good
times
we
are
always
going
to
have
and
you
and
i
must
go
down
to
see
after
poor
jim
family
and
jasper
cried
polly
poking
up
her
head
from
old
protecting
arm
he
must
go
too
grandpapa
and
jasper
why
we
could
do
anything
without
him
polly
said
the
old
gentleman
in
such
a
tone
that
jasper
threw
back
his
head
very
proudly
of
course
my
boy
must
go
too
and
the
next
day
pickering
dodge
who
thought
he
had
some
sort
of
a
claim
on
jasper
for
the
afternoon
came
running
up
the
steps
two
at
a
time
and
he
looked
so
horribly
disappointed
that
old
king
said
why
do
you
take
him
jasper
along
with
us
jasper
who
would
have
much
preferred
to
go
alone
with
his
father
and
polly
swallowed
his
vexation
and
said
all
right
and
when
he
saw
pickering
delight
he
brightened
up
and
was
glad
it
all
happened
in
just
that
way
after
all
now
see
here
said
old
king
suddenly
they
were
turning
out
of
willow
court
after
their
visit
and
thomas
had
a
sorry
time
of
it
managing
his
horses
successfully
about
the
old
tin
cans
and
rubbish
to
say
nothing
of
the
children
who
were
congregated
in
the
narrow
court
why
do
you
boys
do
something
for
those
lads
in
there
pointing
backward
to
the
little
house
they
had
just
left
we
boys
cried
pickering
faintly
oh
dear
me
king
we
ca
do
anything
is
a
bad
word
to
use
said
the
old
gentleman
gravely
and
i
did
mean
that
you
all
alone
should
do
the
work
but
get
the
other
boys
interested
i
sure
you
can
do
that
phew
where
are
the
health
authorities
i
should
like
to
know
to
let
such
abominations
exist
thomas
drive
as
fast
as
you
can
and
get
us
out
of
this
hole
and
he
buried
his
aristocratic
old
face
in
his
handkerchief
pickering
looked
over
at
jasper
in
great
dismay
we
might
have
our
club
take
it
up
said
jasper
slowly
with
a
glance
at
polly
for
help
yes
why
do
you
jasper
she
cried
now
that
what
i
going
to
propose
that
our
club
of
salisbury
girls
shall
do
we
just
finishing
up
the
work
for
a
poor
southern
family
you
had
a
bee
have
you
asked
pickering
or
something
of
that
sort
although
i
do
really
suppose
you
do
much
work
he
said
nonchalantly
only
laugh
and
play
and
giggle
generally
indeed
we
do
pickering
dodge
cried
polly
indignantly
laugh
and
play
and
giggle
the
very
idea
and
if
you
say
such
dreadful
things
i
pitch
you
out
of
the
carriage
cried
jasper
in
pretended
wrath
ow
i
be
good
take
off
your
nippers
cried
pickering
cringing
back
down
into
his
corner
as
far
as
he
could
goodness
me
jasper
you
a
perfect
old
tiger
take
care
and
keep
your
tongue
in
its
place
then
said
jasper
bursting
into
a
laugh
and
we
work
oh
just
dreadfully
declared
polly
with
her
most
positive
air
we
cut
out
all
the
clothes
ourselves
we
do
want
our
mothers
to
do
it
and
sew
oh
dear
me
you
ought
to
see
our
house
on
club
day
when
polly
has
the
bee
said
jasper
i
rather
think
you
say
there
was
something
going
on
for
those
poor
little
southern
darkies
well
i
do
see
how
you
can
work
so
for
a
lot
of
disgusting
pickaninnies
said
pickering
stretching
his
long
figure
lazily
the
whole
bunch
of
them
is
worth
one
good
solid
afternoon
of
play
polly
turned
a
cold
shoulder
to
him
and
began
to
talk
with
jasper
most
busily
about
the
club
of
boys
yes
and
oh
jasper
let
have
one
meeting
of
all
you
boys
with
us
girls
the
two
clubs
together
she
cried
at
last
waxing
quite
enthusiastic
yes
let
us
cried
jasper
just
as
enthusiastic
and
oh
polly
thought
of
something
let
have
a
little
play
you
write
it
oh
jasper
i
ca
cried
polly
wrinkling
her
brows
oh
yes
polly
you
can
cried
jasper
if
it
one
half
as
good
as
three
dragons
and
the
princess
clotilde
it
will
be
just
fine
well
said
polly
i
try
and
what
then
jasper
why
we
give
it
for
money
father
may
we
in
the
and
perhaps
we
make
quite
a
heap
to
help
those
boys
with
oh
polly
he
seized
both
of
her
hands
and
wrung
them
tightly
oh
may
we
father
may
we
eh
what
that
oh
yes
the
old
gentleman
took
down
his
handkerchief
dear
me
what
a
mercy
we
are
where
we
can
breathe
as
thomas
whirled
them
dexterously
past
a
small
square
what
the
health
authorities
about
to
allow
such
atrocious
old
holes
oh
yes
my
boy
i
sure
i
be
delighted
to
have
you
help
along
those
three
lads
and
it
really
work
for
boys
polly
going
to
start
up
something
for
the
girl
how
perfectly
fine
exclaimed
jasper
and
polly
together
now
that
the
consent
was
really
gained
then
they
fell
into
such
a
merry
chatter
that
pickering
left
out
in
the
cold
began
to
wriggle
dreadfully
at
last
he
broke
out
yes
i
think
it
would
be
fine
too
trying
to
work
his
head
into
the
conference
where
polly
and
jasper
had
theirs
together
buzzing
over
the
plans
but
nobody
paid
him
the
slightest
attention
so
he
repeated
his
remark
with
no
better
success
i
should
think
you
might
turn
around
at
last
he
said
in
a
dudgeon
and
speak
to
a
body
once
in
a
while
why
should
we
cried
jasper
over
his
shoulder
you
do
think
worth
while
to
work
for
any
of
those
people
no
polly
we
let
him
severely
alone
then
he
fell
to
talking
again
busier
than
ever
yes
i
do
cried
pickering
in
a
high
wrathful
key
think
it
worth
while
too
so
there
jasper
king
oh
he
does
i
do
believe
jasper
cried
polly
looking
at
face
why
of
course
i
do
said
pickering
and
so
we
must
let
him
into
the
plans
so
polly
turned
around
to
draw
pickering
in
and
old
king
leaned
forward
in
his
seat
and
the
committee
of
ways
and
means
got
so
very
busy
that
they
did
even
know
when
thomas
turned
in
at
the
big
stone
gateway
until
polly
looked
up
and
screamed
out
why
we
are
home
why
we
be
well
we
are
polly
my
child
said
old
king
getting
out
to
help
her
with
his
courtliest
air
we
been
gone
just
three
hours
and
a
half
and
a
very
good
afternoon
work
it
is
too
for
jim
children

care
twice
as
much
for
what
you
young
folks
are
going
to
do
for
them
as
for
anything

may
do
yes
polly
they
will
as
he
saw
her
face
and
i
sure
if
i
were
in
their
places
i
feel
just
the
same
way
x
joel
and
his
dog
now
children
hummed
phronsie
pausing
in
the
midst
of
combing
her
doll
flaxen
hair
you
must
keep
still
and
be
very
good
then
get
through
pretty
soon
and
she
bowed
to
the
several
members
of
her
numerous
family
set
up
in
a
row
before
her
who
were
awaiting
their
turn
for
the
same
attention
then
she
took
up
the
little
comb
which
had
dropped
to
her
lap
and
set
herself
busily
to
her
task
again
alexia
looked
in
at
the
door
of
the
as
phronsie
little
room
devoted
to
her
family
of
dolls
was
called
oh
my
goodness
me
she
exclaimed
do
you
ever
get
tired
of
everlastingly
dressing
those
dolls
phronsie
phronsie
gave
a
sigh
and
went
patiently
on
with
her
work
yes
alexia
i
tired
sometimes
but
i
their
mother
you
see
and
to
comb
their
hair

on
alexia
oh

never

world
phronsie

exclaimed
phronsie
in
horror

alexia
she
tightened
her
grasp
on
the
doll
in
her
arms
yes

should
want
to
throw
every
one
of
those
dreadful
dolls
out
of
the
window
phronsie
pepper
declared
alexia
recklessly
but
they
are
my
children
said
phronsie
very
soberly
trying
to
get
all
the
others
waiting
for
their
hair
to
be
fixed
into
her
arms
too
and
dear
grandpapa
gave
them
to
me
and
i
love
them
every
single
one
well
now
you
see
phronsie
said
alexia
getting
down
on
the
floor
in
front
of
the
doll
bureau
by
phronsie
side
you
could
come
out
with
me
on
the
piazza
and
walk
around
a
bit
if
it
were
not
for
these
dreadfully
tiresome
dolls
and
polly

at
school
and
you
are
through
with
your
lessons
in
king
room
now
how
nice
that
would
be
oh
dear
me
alexia
gave
a
restful
stretch
to
her
long
figure
my
at
a
twinge
of
pain
does
your
arm
hurt
you
alexia
asked
phronsie
looking
over
her
dolls
up
to
alexia
face
um

said
alexia
nursing
her
arm
hanging
in
the
sling
it
a
bad
horrid
old
thing
and
i
like
to
thump
it
oh

alexia
begged
phronsie
that
will
make
it
worse
please
do
alexia
do
anything
to
it
then
she
got
up
and
went
over
with
her
armful
of
dolls
to
the
sofa
and
laid
them
down
carefully
in
a
row

said

going
away
for
a
little
bit
of
a
minute
and
came
back

down
to
the
piazza
she
said
holding
out
her
hand

exclaimed
alexia
seizing
her
with
the
well
hand

you
suppose

be
such
a
selfish
old
pig
as
to
drag
you
off
from

children
of

selfish
old
pig
alexia
and
i
like

very
much
said
phronsie
gravely
trying
not
to
hit
the
arm
in
the
sling
while
alexia
flew
up
to
her
feet
and
whirled
around
the
room
with
her
and
oh
so
afraid
you
make
it
sick
she
panted
do
stop
i
just
ca
phronsie
said
alexia
i

die
if

something
oh
this
horrid
old
arm
and
she
came
to
a
sudden
standstill
phronsie
struggling
away
to
a
safe
distance
papa
fisher
would
not
like
it
alexia
she
said
in
great
disapproval
her
hair
blown
about
her
face
and
her
cheeks
quite
pink
oh
dear
me
alexia
resting
the
sling
in
the
other
palm
and
trying
not
to
scream
with
the
pain
burst
out
it
so
tiresome
to
be
always
thinking
that
some
one
wo
like
things
one
does
phronsie
there
no
use
in
my
trying
to
be
good
because
you
see
i
never
could
be
i
just

to
do
bad
things
oh
no
alexia
said
phronsie
greatly
shocked
you
do
love
to
do
bad
things
please
say
you
do
and
before
alexia
could
say
another
word
the
tears
poured
down
the
round
cheeks
wetting
pinafore
and
although
she
clasped
her
hands
and
tried
to
stop
them
it
was
no
use
there
now
you
see
cried
alexia
quite
gone
in
remorse
oh
what
shall
i
do
i
must
go
and
get
fisher
and
she
rushed
out
of
the
room
phronsie
ran
unsteadily
after
her
to
call
oh
alexia
in
such
distress
that
the
flying
feet
turned
and
up
she
came
again
what
is
it
pet
she
cried
oh
dear
me
what
shall
i
do
i
must
tell
your
mother
i
will
stop
said
phronsie
struggling
hard
with
her
tears
if
you
only
wo
tell
mamsie
and
she
wiped
her
cheeks
hard
with
her
pinafore
there
see
alexia
and
tried
to
smile
well
now
come
back
alexia
seized
her
hand
and
dragged
her
up
the
stairs
now
i
just
going
to
stay
up
here
with
you
if

bad
things

she
cried
in
a
gust
as
she
threw
herself
down
on
the
floor
again
oh
alexia
you
never
could
be
good
like
polly
said
phronsie
standing
quite
still
in
astonishment
of
course
not
said
alexia
with
a
little
laugh
but
i
mean
oh
you
know
what
i
mean
phronsie
i

horrible
old

i
wish

much
you

alexia
said
phronsie
not
offering
to
sit
down
they
are
my
children
and
i
do
think
they
like
to
be
called
anything
else
well
they
hear
it
then
declared
alexia
decidedly
so
get
some
of
them
and
brush
their
hair
just
as
you
were
doing
when
i
came
in
and
i
going
to
read
aloud
to
you
out
of
one
of
your
books
phronsie
oh
oh
phronsie
clapped
her
hands
in
glee
next
to
polly
stories
which
of
course
she
could
have
now
as
polly
was
at
school
phronsie
dearly
loved
to
be
read
to
but
she
suddenly
grew
very
sober
again
are
you
sure
you
will
like
it
alexia
she
asked
coming
up
to
peer
into
alexia
face
yes
yes
pet
to
be
sure
i
will
cried
alexia
seizing
her
to
half
smother
her
with
kisses
why
phronsie
it
will
make
me
very
happy
indeed
well
if
it
will
really
make
you
happy
alexia
said
phronsie
smoothing
down
her
pinafore
in
great
satisfaction
i
will
get
my
children
and
she
ran
over
to
the
sofa
and
came
back
with
an
armful
now
what
book
asked
alexia
forgetting
whether
her
arm
ached
or
not
and
flying
to
her
feet
i
going
down
to
your
bookshelf
to
get
it
oh
alexia
cried
phronsie
in
great
excitement
will
you
could
you
get
little
yellow
duck
as
this
was
the
book
phronsie
invariably
chose
when
asked
what
she
wanted
read
alexia
laughed
and
spun
off
perfectly
astonished
to
find
that
the
world
was
not
all
as
blue
as
an
indigo
bag
and
when
she
came
back
two
steps
at
a
time
up
the
stairs
phronsie
was
smiling
away
and
humming
softly
to
herself
while
the
was
going
on
she
had
a
blue
ribbon
on
yesterday
almira
did
said
phronsie
reflecting
now
would
you
put
on
a
pink
one
alexia
i
surely
should
decided
alexia
that
pretty
pale
pink
one
that
polly
gave
you
last
phronsie
i
am
so
very
glad
you
said
that
one
said
phronsie
running
over
on
happy
feet
for
her
because
i
do
love
that
ribbon
very
much
alexia
well
now
then
said
alexia
as
phronsie
began
to
tie
up
the
pink
bow
laboriously
we
must
hurry
and
begin
or
we
never
shall
see
what
happened
to
this
yellow
duck
oh
do
hurry
alexia
begged
phronsie
as
if
she
had
heard
the
story
on
an
average
of
half
a
dozen
times
a
week
so
alexia
propped
herself
up
against
the
wall
and
began
and
presently
it
was
so
still
that
all
any
one
could
hear
was
the
turning
of
the
leaves
and
the
ticking
of
the
little
french
clock
on
the
mantel
well
dear
me
how
funny
and
polly
rushed
in
then
burst
into
a
merry
laugh
polly
pepper
you
home
alexia
tossed
the
little
yellow
duck
half
across
the
room
flew
to
her
feet
again
and
spun
polly
round
and
round
with
her
well
hand
yes
said
polly
i
am
and
i
been
searching
for
you
two
all
over
this
house
take
me
polly
do
phronsie
laid
down
almira
carefully
on
the
carpet
and
hurried
over
to
polly
i
guess
i
will
now
then
all
together
and
the
three
spun
off
until
out
of
breath
oh
dear
me
polly
stopped
suddenly
i
never
thought
of
your
arm
alexia
oh
do
you
suppose
we
hurt
it
it
was
so
very
dreadful
to
think
of
that
all
the
color
deserted
her
cheek
nonsense
no
declared
alexia
that
spin
put
new
life
into
me
polly
well
i
do
know
said
polly
critically
at
any
rate
we
must
do
it
any
more
and
we
must
tell
about
it
as
soon
as
he
gets
home
oh
what
good
is
it
to
worry
him
cried
alexia
carelessly
well
polly
tell
all
the
news
about
school
as
they
hurried
downstairs
to
get
ready
for
luncheon
we
must
tell
everything
about
it
alexia
said
polly
in
her
most
decided
fashion
putting
her
arm
carefully
around
waist
and
with
phronsie
hanging
to
the
other
hand
down
they
went
polly
retailing
the
last
bit
of
school
news
fresh
that
day
and
oh
alexia
miss
salisbury
said
we
are
not
to
have
the
picnic
until
you
get
quite
well
she
said
so
in
the
big
schoolroom
before
us
all
did
she
polly
cried
alexia
immensely
gratified
yes
she
did
polly
stood
on
her
tiptoes
at
the
imminent
danger
of
going
on
her
nose
and
pulling
the
other
down
to
get
a
kiss
on
the
long
sallow
cheek
she
said
it
very
distinctly
alexia
and
all
the
girls
talked
about
it
afterward
well
she
a
dear
old
thing
exclaimed
alexia
with
remorseful
little
pangs
at
the
memory
of
certain
episodes
at
the
school
and
i
shall
try
oh
polly
i
try
so
hard
to
be
nice
and
please
her
polly
gave
her
two
or
three
little
pats
on
her
back
and
do
you
think
cried
polly
flying
off
to
brush
her
hair
and
calling
back
through
the
open
door
that
the
boys
are
going
to
have
their
club
meet
with
ours
just
think
of
that
oh
polly
alexia
came
flying
in
brush
in
hand
you
really
mean
it
i
do
jasper
just
told
me
so
well
hurry
alexia
else
we
be
late
warned
polly
brushing
away
vigorously
yes
phronsie
for
phronsie
had
gone
off
for
jane
to
put
on
a
clean
apron
we
ready
now
that
is
almost
when
when
polly
could
hear
alexia
frantically
asking
as
she
rushed
back
into
her
room
which
was
next
to
polly
own
oh
just
as
soon
as
you
are
able
called
polly
now
do
ask
any
more
questions
alexia
she
begged
merrily
yes
mamsie
coming
that
afternoon
percy
and
joel
were
rushing
back
to
school
from
an
errand
down
to
the
village
and
hurrying
along
with
an
awful
feeling
that
the
bell
in
the
big
tower
on
the
playground
would
strike
in
a
minute
hold
on
called
percy
considerably
in
the
rear
how
you
get
over
the
ground
joe
and
you
such
a
snail
observed
joel
pleasantly
nevertheless
he
paused
what
that
pricking
up
his
ears
i
do
hear
anything
percy
came
up
panting
of
course
not
when
you
puffing
like
a
grampus
what
a
grampus
asked
percy
irritably
i
do
know
said
joel
honestly
well
i
would
say
words
i
did
know
what
they
meant
said
percy
in
a
patronizing
tone
and
trying
not
to
realize
that
he
was
very
hot
well
do
keep
still
will
you
roared
joel
there
there
it
is
again
he
stooped
down
and
peered
within
a
hedge
something
crying
in
here
you
get
your
eyes
scratched
out
most
likely
by
an
old
cross
cat
suggested
percy
joel
who
cared
very
little
for
that
or
any
warning
was
now
on
his
knees
oh
whickets
he
exclaimed
dragging
out
a
small
yellow
dog
who
instead
of
struggling
wormed
himself
all
up
against
his
rescuer
whining
pitifully
he
hurt
declared
joel
tossing
back
his
stubby
locks
and
patting
the
dog
who
stopped
whining
and
licked
him
all
over
as
much
of
his
face
and
hands
as
he
could
reach
oh
that
dirty
thing
faugh
how
can
you
joel
pepper
cried
percy
in
distress
but
joel
did
even
hear
him
being
occupied
in
setting
the
dog
on
the
ground
to
try
his
paces
no
he
not
hurt
after
all
i
guess
he
decided
but
look
at
his
ribs
he
half
starved
i
do
want
to
look
at
them
said
percy
turning
his
back
and
you
ought
to
let
him
alone
that
bell
will
ring
in
half
a
second
joel
pepper
true
enough
cried
joel
come
on
perky
this
being
the
school
name
of
the
older
whitney
and
he
picked
up
the
dog
and
shot
off
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
that
dog
yelled
percy
after
him
but
as
well
talk
to
the
wind
as
joel
arrived
hot
and
breathless
at
the
big
door
long
before
him
luckily
for
him
none
of
the
boys
were
about
and
joel
cramming
the
dog
well
under
his
jacket
plunged
up
the
stairs
and
down
the
hall
to
his
room
joe
roared
two
or
three
voices
but
he
turned
a
deaf
ear
and
got
in
safely
slammed
to
the
door
and
then
drew
a
long
breath
almost
caught
that
time
was
all
he
had
the
wind
to
say
well
now
it
good
dave
is
in
i
can
tell
him
slowly
and
get
him
used
to
it
all
this
time
he
was
drawing
out
his
dog
from
its
place
of
refuge
and
putting
it
first
on
the
bed
then
on
the
floor
to
study
it
better
it
certainly
was
as
far
removed
from
being
even
a
dog
as
possible
having
never
in
its
life
had
the
good
fortune
to
hear
its
pedigree
spoken
of
it
was
simply
an
cur
that
looked
as
if
it
had
exchanged
the
back
yard
of
a
tenement
house
for
the
greater
dangers
of
the
open
street
its
yellow
neck
was
marked
where
a
cruel
cord
had
almost
worn
into
the
flesh
and
every
one
of
its
ribs
stuck
out
as
joel
had
said
till
they
insisted
on
being
counted
by
a
strict
observer
joel
threw
his
arms
around
the
beast
oh
dear
he
groaned
starved
to
death
what
have
i
got
to
give
you
he
wrinkled
his
forehead
in
great
distress
oh
goody
he
snatched
the
dog
up
and
bore
him
to
the
closet
then
pulled
down
a
box
from
the
shelf
above
cake
how
prime
and
not
stopping
to
cut
a
piece
he
broke
off
a
goodly
wedge
now
then
get
in
with
you
and
he
thrust
him
deep
into
one
corner
cramming
the
cake
up
to
his
nose
stay
there
on
my
side
and
do
get
over
on
dave
shoes
the
dog
in
seizing
the
cake
had
taken
joel
thumb
as
well
let
go
there
cried
joel
well
you
ca
swallow
my
thumb
as
the
cake
disappeared
in
one
lump
and
he
gave
a
sigh
for
the
plums
with
which
mamsie
always
liberally
supplied
the
school
cakes
now
disappearing
so
fast
as
much
as
for
the
nip
he
had
received
the
dog
turned
his
black
beady
eyes
sharply
for
more
cake
when
he
saw
that
it
was
coming
he
licked
joel
thumb
and
in
his
cramped
quarters
on
top
of
a
heap
of
shoes
and
various
other
things
not
exactly
classified
he
tried
hard
to
wag
his
stump
of
a
tail
whickets
there
goes
that
bell
now
see
here
do
you
dare
to
stir
for
your
life
you
got
to
stay
in
this
closet
till
then
i
see
what
to
do
for
you
lie
down
i
tell
you
there
was
a
small
scuffle
and
then
the
dog
realizing
here
was
a
master
curled
himself
on
top
of
some
tennis
shoes
and
looked
as
if
he
held
his
breath
all
right
said
joel
with
an
approving
pat
now
do
you
yip
even
if
dave
opens
this
door
then
he
shut
it
carefully
and
rushed
off
down
to
the
long
to
the
crowd
of
boys
joel
ate
his
supper
as
rapidly
as
possible
lost
to
the
chatter
going
on
around
him
he
imagined
in
his
feverishness
that
he
heard
faint
yaps
every
now
and
then
and
he
almost
expected
to
see
everybody
lay
down
knife
and
fork
what
the
matter
with
you
he
was
aroused
by
seeing
the
boy
next
to
him
lean
forward
to
peer
into
his
face
and
in
a
minute
he
was
conscious
that
on
the
other
side
he
was
just
as
much
of
an
object
of
attention
he
buried
his
face
in
his
glass
of
milk
but
when
he
took
it
out
they
were
staring
still
the
same
ugh
stop
your
looking
at
me
growled
joel
what
the
matter
with
you
anyway
asked
the
other
boy
get
away
nothing
said
joel
crossly
and
bestowing
as
much
of
a
kick
as
he
dared
on
the
other
boy
shin
ow
there
is
too
you
awfully
funny
said
the
first
boy
you
have
spoken
a
word
since
you
sat
down
well
i
ai
going
to
talk
if
i
do
want
to
declared
joel
do
stop
fletcher
everybody
looking
but
fletcher
would
stop
and
joel
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
the
whole
table
with
the
harrow
at
the
head
making
him
between
their
mouthfuls
the
centre
of
observation
the
only
alleviation
of
this
misery
was
that
percy
was
at
another
table
and
with
his
back
to
him
david
looked
across
in
a
worried
way
are
you
sick
joe
he
asked
no
joel
laughed
and
began
to
eat
busily
when
he
saw
that
david
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
harrow
was
telling
something
just
then
that
seemed
of
more
than
common
interest
and
the
boys
hearing
joel
laugh
once
more
turned
off
to
listen
yes
said
the
it
was
a
dog
that
was
ugh
cried
joel
oh
beg
pardon
and
his
face
grew
dreadfully
red
as
he
tried
to
get
as
small
as
possible
on
his
chair
it
a
dog
i
used
to
own
joel
said
harrow
smiling
at
him
and
i
taught
him
tricks
several
quite
remarkable
ones
yes
sir
mumbled
joel
taking
a
big
bite
of
his
biscuit
and
for
the
next
quarter
of
an
hour
he
was
safe
as
the
funny
stories
lasted
till
back
went
the
chairs
and
the
evening
meal
was
over
to
say
that
joel
life
was
an
easy
one
till
bedtime
would
be
very
far
from
the
truth
strange
to
say
david
did
not
go
to
the
closet
once
to
be
sure
there
was
a
narrow
escape
that
made
joel
heart
leap
to
his
mouth
let
have
mamsie
cake
joe
said
david
in
an
aside
to
him
the
room
was
full
of
boys
it
was
just
before
study
hour
and
how
to
tell
david
of
the
dog
was
racking
joe
powers
of
mind
ugh
no
not
dave
he
was
so
very
decided
that
although
david
was
puzzled
at
his
manner
he
gave
it
up
without
a
question
and
then
came
study
hour
when
all
the
boys
must
be
down
in
long
hall
and
joel
lingered
behind
the
others
i
be
down
in
a
minute
he
flew
over
to
the
closet
broke
off
another
generous
wedge
of
mamsie
cake
stifling
a
second
sigh
as
he
thought
of
the
plums
you
have
eaten
my
half
yet
he
said
as
the
dog
swallowed
it
whole
without
winking
keep
still
now
he
slammed
to
the
door
again
and
was
off
his
books
under
his
arm
and
after
the
two
boys
went
up
to
bed
david
was
too
tired
and
sleepy
to
talk
and
hopped
into
his
bed
so
quickly
that
long
before
joel
was
undressed
he
was
off
to
dreamland
that
good
now
i
have
got
to
tell
him
till
morning
joel
went
over
to
the
other
bed
in
the
corner
and
listened
to
the
regular
breathing
then
tiptoed
softly
off
to
the
closet
first
putting
out
the
light
i
know
what
i
going
to
do
he
got
down
on
and
put
his
hand
out
softly
over
the
pile
of
shoes
till
he
felt
the
dog
mangy
back
i
going
to
take
you
in
my
bed
you
smother
in
here
now
sir
the
dog
was
ready
enough
to
be
quiet
only
occupied
in
licking
joel
hands
so
joel
jumped
into
his
bed
carrying
his
charge
and
huddled
down
under
the
clothes
after
being
quite
sure
that
he
was
really
to
remain
in
this
paradise
the
dog
began
to
turn
around
and
around
to
find
exactly
the
best
position
in
which
to
settle
down
for
the
night
this
took
him
so
long
interrupted
as
the
process
was
with
so
many
lickings
of
joel
brown
face
that
it
looked
as
if
neither
would
get
very
much
sleep
that
night
joel
not
averse
to
this
lengthy
operation
hugging
his
dog
and
patting
him
to
his
complete
demoralization
just
as
he
was
about
to
quiet
down
at
last
even
joel
was
tired
and
his
eyes
drooped
now
go
to
sleep
with
a
final
pat
i
going
to
call
you
sinbad
joel
having
always
been
mightily
taken
with
sinbad
the
sailor
felt
that
no
other
name
could
be
quite
good
enough
for
his
new
treasure
and
sinbad
realizing
that
a
call
to
repose
had
actually
been
given
curled
up
in
as
round
a
ball
as
he
could
under
joel
chin
and
both
were
soon
sound
asleep
it
was
near
the
middle
of
the
night
joel
had
been
dreaming
of
his
old
menagerie
and
circus
he
had
once
in
the
little
brown
house
in
which
there
were
not
only
trained
dogs
who
could
do
the
most
wonderful
things
strange
to
say
now
they
were
all
of
them
yellow
and
had
stumpy
tails
but
animals
and
reptiles
of
the
most
delightful
variety
never
seen
in
any
other
show
on
earth
when
a
noise
that
at
once
suggested
a
boy
screaming
struck
upon
his
ear
and
brought
him
bolt
upright
in
his
bed
he
pawed
wildly
around
but
sinbad
was
nowhere
to
be
found
xi
the
united
clubs
the
whole
dormitory
was
in
an
uproar
help
help
harrow
having
gone
out
after
dinner
had
retired
late
and
was
now
sound
asleep
so
another
instructor
scaled
the
stairs
getting
there
long
before
fox
the
matron
could
put
in
an
appearance
in
the
babel
it
was
somewhat
difficult
to
locate
the
boy
who
had
screamed
out
at
last
in
there
farnham
room
cried
several
voices
at
once
nightmare
i
suppose
said
the
instructor
to
himself
dashing
in
but
it
was
a
real
thing
he
soon
saw
as
a
knot
of
boys
huddled
around
the
bed
where
the
terrified
occupant
still
sat
drawing
up
his
knees
to
his
chin
and
screaming
all
sorts
of
things
in
which
wild
beast
and
cold
nose
was
all
that
could
be
distinguished
illustration
just
then
something
skimmed
out
from
the
corner
stop
this
noise
commanded
the
instructor
who
had
none
of
harrow
pleasant
but
decided
ways
for
quelling
an
incipient
riot
so
they
bawled
on
the
boy
in
bed
yelling
that
he
would
be
left
alone
just
then
something
skimmed
out
from
the
corner
the
boys
flew
to
one
side
showing
a
tendency
to
find
the
door
even
the
instructor
jumped
then
he
bethought
himself
to
light
the
gas
which
brought
out
the
fact
that
there
certainly
was
an
animal
in
the
room
as
they
could
hear
it
now
under
the
bed
boys
be
quiet
fox
cat
has
got
up
here
probably
said
the
instructor
but
the
boy
in
the
bed
protested
that
it
was
a
cat
that
had
waked
him
up
by
thrusting
a
cold
nose
in
his
face
and
jumping
on
top
of
him
and
he
huddled
worse
than
ever
now
that
it
was
under
him
yet
afraid
to
step
out
on
the
floor
even
the
instructor
did
not
offer
to
look
under
the
bed
when
joel
pepper
rushed
in
his
black
eyes
gleaming
oh
it
my
dog
he
cried
it
joe
pepper
dog
cried
the
whole
roomful
nearly
tumbling
over
each
other
and
when
did
you
begin
to
keep
a
dog
joel
pepper
hurled
the
instructor
at
him
too
angry
for
anything
that
he
had
impressed
the
boys
with
his
courage
but
joel
was
occupied
in
ramming
his
body
under
the
bed
as
far
as
possible
here
sinbad
and
he
presently
emerged
with
a
very
red
face
and
sinbad
safely
in
his
arms
who
seemed
perfectly
delighted
to
get
into
his
old
refuge
again
david
had
now
joined
the
group
as
much
aghast
as
every
other
spectator
do
you
hear
me
joel
pepper
thundered
the
instructor
again
when
did
you
get
that
dog
this
brought
joel
to
oh
i
have
had
him
long
sir
he
said
and
trembling
for
sinbad
as
he
felt
in
every
fibre
of
his
being
that
the
beast
fate
was
sealed
unless
he
could
win
over
the
irritated
teacher
he
a
poor
dog
i
i
found
sir
wishing
he
could
think
of
the
right
words
and
knowing
that
every
word
he
uttered
only
made
matters
worse
david
cried
the
instructor
catching
davie
eye
down
by
the
door
do
you
know
anything
about
this
dog
no
sir
said
david
all
in
a
tremble
and
wishing
he
could
say
something
to
help
joel
out
well
now
you
wait
a
minute
the
instructor
feeling
that
here
was
a
chance
to
impress
the
boys
with
his
executive
ability
looked
about
over
the
table
where
farnham
schoolbooks
were
thrown
got
a
bit
of
string
no
oh
yes
he
pounced
on
a
piece
and
came
over
to
joel
and
the
dog
what
are
you
going
to
do
sir
joel
hung
to
sinbad
with
a
tighter
grip
than
ever
never
mind
it
not
for
you
to
question
me
said
the
instructor
with
great
authority
but
joel
edged
away
visions
of
being
expelled
from
marks
school
swam
before
his
eyes
and
he
turned
very
white
david
plunged
through
the
crowd
of
boys
absolutely
still
with
the
excitement
oh
joel
he
begged
hoarsely
let
parr
do
as
he
wants
to
mamsie
would
say
so
joel
turned
at
that
do
hurt
him
he
begged
do
please
mr
parr
i
shall
not
hurt
him
said
parr
putting
the
cord
about
the
neck
and
holding
the
other
end
after
it
was
knotted
fast
i
am
going
to
tie
him
in
the
area
till
morning
here
you
sir
as
sinbad
showed
lively
intentions
toward
his
captor
legs
with
a
backward
glance
at
his
late
master
oh
if
you
let
me
keep
him
in
my
room
parr
cried
joel
tumbling
over
to
the
instructor
who
was
executing
a
series
of
remarkable
steps
as
he
dragged
sinbad
off
i
i
be
just
as
good
just
till
the
morning
sir
oh
parr
i
study
and
get
my
lessons
better
i
truly
will
cried
poor
joel
unable
to
promise
anything
more
difficult
of
performance
you
have
to
study
better
anyway
joel
pepper
said
parr
grimly
as
he
and
sinbad
disappeared
down
the
stairway
every
boy
get
back
to
his
room
was
the
parting
command
no
need
to
tell
joel
he
dashed
through
the
ranks
and
flung
himself
into
his
bed
dragged
up
the
clothes
well
over
his
stubby
head
and
cried
as
if
his
heart
would
break
joel
joel
oh
joey
begged
david
hoarsely
and
running
to
precipitate
himself
by
his
side
but
joel
only
burrowed
deeper
and
sobbed
on
and
davie
trying
to
keep
awake
to
give
possible
comfort
at
last
tumbled
asleep
when
joel
with
a
flood
of
fresh
sorrow
rolled
over
as
near
to
the
wall
as
he
could
get
and
tried
to
hold
in
his
sobs
as
soon
as
he
dared
the
next
morning
joel
hopped
over
david
still
asleep
and
out
of
bed
jumped
into
his
clothes
and
ran
softly
downstairs
there
in
the
area
was
sinbad
who
had
evidently
concluded
to
make
the
best
of
it
and
accept
the
situation
for
he
was
curled
up
in
as
small
a
compass
as
possible
and
was
even
attempting
a
little
sleep
i
wo
let
him
see
me
said
joel
to
himself
but
as
soon
as
marks
is
up
and
he
glanced
over
at
the
master
house
for
any
sign
of
things
beginning
to
move
for
the
day
and
dressed
why
i
go
and
ask
him
what
he
did
dare
to
say
for
joel
had
been
able
with
all
his
thinking
to
devise
any
plan
whereby
sinbad
could
be
saved
but
perhaps
marks
will
know
he
kept
thinking
and
after
a
while
the
shades
were
drawn
up
at
the
red
brick
house
across
the
yard
the
housemaid
came
out
to
brush
off
the
steps
and
various
other
indications
showed
that
the
master
was
beginning
to
think
of
the
new
day
and
its
duties
joel
plunged
across
the
yard
it
was
awful
he
knew
to
intrude
at
the
master
house
before
breakfast
but
by
that
time
oh
dreadful
sinbad
would
probably
be
beyond
the
help
of
any
rescuing
hand
for
parr
would
without
a
doubt
deliver
him
to
the
garbage
man
to
be
hauled
off
and
joel
with
no
thought
of
consequences
to
himself
plunged
recklessly
on
is
marks
up
he
demanded
of
the
housemaid
who
only
stared
at
him
and
went
on
with
her
work
of
sweeping
off
the
steps
is
marks
up
cried
joel
his
black
eyes
flashing
and
going
halfway
up
yes
but
what
of
it
cried
the
housemaid
airily
leaning
on
her
broom
a
minute
oh
i
must
see
him
cried
joel
bounding
into
the
hall
it
was
such
a
cry
of
distress
that
it
penetrated
far
within
the
house
oh
my
you
outrageous
boy
exclaimed
the
housemaid
shaking
her
broom
at
him
you
come
right
out
meantime
a
voice
said
what
is
it
and
there
was
marks
in
dressing
gown
and
slippers
looking
over
the
railing
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
oh
marks
dr
marks
joel
not
giving
himself
time
to
think
dashed
over
the
stairs
to
look
up
into
the
face
under
the
hair
the
master
could
scarcely
conceal
his
amazement
but
he
made
a
brave
effort
at
why
pepper
he
exclaimed
and
there
was
a
good
deal
of
displeasure
in
face
and
manner
so
much
so
that
joel
knees
knocked
smartly
together
and
everything
swam
before
his
eyes
well
what
did
you
want
to
see
me
for
pepper
marks
was
inquiring
so
joel
blurted
out
a
dog
sir
a
repeated
marks
and
now
he
showed
his
amazement
and
displeasure
as
well
and
is
this
what
you
have
interrupted
me
to
say
at
this
unseasonable
hour
joel
pepper
oh
cried
joel
and
then
he
broke
right
down
and
went
flat
on
the
stairs
crying
as
if
his
heart
would
break
and
marks
threw
on
her
pretty
blue
wrapper
in
a
dreadful
tremor
and
rushed
out
with
restoratives
and
the
housemaid
who
shook
her
broom
at
joel
ran
on
remorseful
feet
for
a
glass
of
water
and
the
master
whole
house
was
in
a
ferment
but
marks
waved
them
all
aside
the
boy
needs
nothing
he
said
come
joel
he
took
his
hand
all
grimy
and
streaked
and
looked
at
his
poor
swollen
eyelids
and
nose
over
which
the
tears
were
still
falling
and
in
a
minute
he
had
him
in
his
own
private
study
with
the
door
shut
when
he
emerged
a
after
joel
was
actually
smiling
he
had
hold
of
the
master
hand
and
clutched
in
his
other
fist
was
a
note
somewhat
changed
in
appearance
from
its
immaculate
condition
when
delivered
by
marks
to
the
bearer
yes
sir
joel
was
saying
i
do
it
all
just
as
you
say
sir
and
he
ran
like
lightning
across
the
yard
the
note
put
into
the
instructor
hand
made
him
change
countenance
more
than
once
in
the
course
of
its
reading
it
simply
said
for
it
was
very
short
that
the
dog
was
to
be
delivered
to
joel
pepper
who
was
to
bring
it
to
the
master
house
and
although
there
was
a
line
or
even
a
word
to
show
any
disapproval
of
his
course
parr
felt
as
he
set
about
obeying
it
as
if
somehow
he
had
made
a
little
mistake
somewhere
all
joel
thought
of
however
was
to
get
possession
of
sinbad
and
when
once
he
had
the
cord
in
his
hand
he
untied
it
with
trembling
fingers
sinbad
in
his
transport
hampering
the
operation
dreadfully
by
bobbing
his
head
about
in
his
violent
efforts
to
lick
joel
face
and
hands
for
he
had
about
given
up
in
despair
the
idea
of
ever
seeing
him
again
he
glad
to
go
is
he
joel
observed
the
instructor
to
break
the
ice
and
make
conversation
but
no
such
effort
was
necessary
for
joel
looked
up
brightly
he
sir
now
say
at
last
the
string
was
loose
and
dangling
to
the
hook
in
the
area
wall
and
joel
held
the
dog
up
and
stuck
out
his
paw
said
parr
laughing
as
he
took
it
and
quite
relieved
to
find
that
relations
were
not
strained
after
all
as
joel
hugging
his
dog
sped
hastily
across
the
yard
again
to
the
master
house
marks
never
told
how
very
ugly
he
found
the
dog
but
summoning
the
man
who
kept
his
garden
and
lawn
in
order
he
consigned
sinbad
to
his
care
with
another
note
now
joel
he
said
you
know
this
payment
comes
every
week
out
of
your
allowance
for
this
dog
keeping
eh
it
is
clearly
understood
joel
oh
yes
sir
yes
shouted
joel
perhaps
we
be
able
to
find
a
good
home
for
him
well
sinbad
said
the
master
as
sinbad
with
the
gardener
hand
over
his
eyes
so
that
he
could
not
see
joel
was
marched
off
marks
from
the
veranda
charging
that
the
note
be
delivered
and
read
before
leaving
the
dog
oh
i
going
to
take
him
home
at
vacation
announced
joel
decidedly
indeed
well
now
perhaps
your
grandfather
wo
care
for
him
you
must
not
count
too
much
upon
it
my
boy
all
the
control
in
the
world
could
not
keep
the
master
from
smiling
now
oh
i
guess
he
will
joel
was
in
no
wise
disturbed
by
the
doubt
well
run
along
to
breakfast
with
you
pepper
cried
marks
and
the
next
time
you
come
over
to
see
me
do
bring
any
more
dogs
so
joel
in
high
good
spirits
and
thinking
how
he
would
soon
run
down
to
the
little
old
cobbler
where
the
master
had
sent
the
dog
chased
off
across
the
yard
once
more
and
slipped
in
to
breakfast
with
a
terrible
appetite
and
a
manner
as
if
nothing
especial
had
happened
the
preceding
night
and
all
the
boys
rubbed
their
eyes
particularly
as
joel
and
parr
seemed
to
be
on
the
best
of
terms
and
once
when
something
was
said
about
a
dog
by
harrow
who
had
heard
anything
of
the
midnight
tumult
in
the
dormitory
and
was
for
continuing
the
account
of
his
trained
pet
the
other
and
joel
pepper
indulged
in
smiles
and
nods
perfectly
mystifying
to
all
the
other
people
at
the
table
david
included
david
when
he
woke
up
which
was
quite
late
to
find
joel
gone
had
been
terribly
frightened
but
chancing
to
look
out
of
the
window
he
saw
him
racing
across
the
yard
and
watching
closely
he
discovered
that
he
had
something
in
his
arms
and
that
he
turned
in
to
the
master
house
i
ca
do
anything
now
said
davie
to
himself
in
the
greatest
distress
yet
somehow
when
he
came
to
think
of
it
it
seemed
to
be
with
a
great
deal
of
hope
since
marks
was
to
be
appealed
to
and
when
came
and
with
it
joel
so
blithe
and
hungry
david
fell
to
on
his
own
breakfast
with
a
fine
appetite
all
the
boys
of
the
club
not
one
to
be
reported
absent
presented
themselves
at
king
on
club
night
and
all
the
members
of
the
salisbury
school
club
came
promptly
together
with
one
new
member
cathie
harrison
who
at
polly
suggestion
had
been
voted
in
at
the
last
meeting
alexia
still
had
her
arm
in
a
sling
and
indeed
she
was
quite
willing
it
should
remain
so
for
she
was
in
constant
terror
that
her
aunt
who
had
been
persuaded
to
leave
her
would
insist
on
the
return
home
so
alexia
begged
off
at
every
mention
of
the
subject
as
grandpapa
king
and
mother
fisher
were
very
glad
to
have
the
visit
lengthened
she
was
as
gay
as
ever
and
was
quite
in
her
element
it
had
been
so
long
since
she
had
had
a
good
time
oh
jasper
she
cried
can
we
all
get
into
your
den
i
think
so
said
jasper
who
had
already
settled
all
that
with
polly
counting
every
member
as
coming
in
order
to
make
no
mistake
we
to
have
the
in
there
alexia
and
after
that
father
has
invited
us
in
to
the
what
richness
exclaimed
alexia
sinking
into
one
of
the
library
chairs
to
pull
out
her
skirts
and
play
with
her
rings
oh
jasper
king
i
should
think
you
ever
in
all
this
world
get
used
to
living
in
this
perfectly
exquisite
house
well
i
always
lived
here
alexia
said
jasper
with
a
laugh
so
i
suppose
that
is
the
reason
i
not
overwhelmed
now
oh
here
comes
clare
all
right
old
fellow
glad
you
come
now
i
call
the
meeting
to

was
the
secretary
and
the
rest
of
the
boys
and
girls
assembling

was
soon
begun
in
the
den
jasper
who
was
the
president
of
the
boys
club
flourishing
his
gavel
in
great
style
now
we
come
together
announced
the
president
after
the
regular
business
was
disposed
of
to
get
up
a
plan
by
which
we
can
accomplish
something
more
than
merely
to
have
a
good
time
nonsense
interrupted
clare
we
want
a
good
time
for
shame
jasper
pounded
his
gavel
to
restore
order
and
to
begin
with
it
is
as
well
to
announce
at
once
that
all
unruly
members
will
be
put
out
with
a
stern
glance
at
the
secretary
oh
dear
me
exclaimed
clare
huddling
down
into
his
big
chair
go
along
prex
said
pickering
coming
over
from
the
other
side
of
the
room

first
and
then
i
carry

the
pieces
afterward

on
prexy
they
all

plan
well
the
president
cleared
his
throat
hem
and
in
order
to
do
good
work
why
we
had
to
ask
the
girls
club
to
come
to
this
meeting
and
not
necessarily
put
in
clare
pickering
pounced
for
him
but
instead
of
sitting
on
him
his
long
figure
doubled
up
in
the
big
chair
while
the
secretary
slipped
neatly
out
ha
ha
did
you
ever
get
left
giggled
clare
at
a
safe
distance
many
a
time
my
dear
child
said
pickering
coolly
leaning
back
restfully
but
never
in
such
a
good
seat
thank
you
secretary
proceed
prexy
good
for
you
pickering
cried
alexia
while
the
laugh
went
around
order
cried
jasper
pounding
away
now
that
our
troublesome
secretary
is
quieted
i
will
proceed
to
say
that
as
we
want
the
plan
to
succeed
we
invited
the
salisbury
club
this
evening
thank
you
president
the
girls
clapped
vigorously
so
now
after
i
tell
you
of
the
object
i
want
you
to
express
your
minds
about
the
various
plans
that
will
be
laid
before
you
then
jasper
told
the
story
of
jim
the
brakeman
and
how
grandpapa
and
polly
and
he
had
gone
to
the
poor
home
thanks
to
the
little
clerk
and
how
the
three
boys
who
were
waiting
for
education
and
the
girl
who
was
crazy
to
take
to
say
nothing
of
the
two
mites
of
children
toddling
around
made
the
poor
widow
almost
frantic
as
she
thought
of
their
support
until
some
of
the
girls
were
sniffling
and
hunting
for
their
handkerchiefs
and
the
boys
considerately
turned
away
and
would
look
at
them
now
you
tell
the
rest
polly
cried
jasper
quite
tired
out
oh
no
you
tell
said
polly
who
dearly
loved
to
hear
jasper
talk
do
polly
and
he
pushed
the
hair
off
from
his
forehead
so
as
she
saw
he
really
wanted
her
to
polly
began
with
shining
eyes
and
glowing
cheeks
to
finish
the
story
and
she
told
how
grandpapa
had
ordered
provisions
and
coal
for
the
poor
widow
enough
for
many
months
to
come
and
how
oh
was
that
perfectly
splendid
in
dear
grandpapa
he
had
promised
that
the
little
girl
arethusa
was
her
name
should
take
from
one
of
the
teachers
in
the
city
and
polly
clasped
her
hands
and
sighed
quite
unable
to
do
more
and
what
do
you
want
us
to
do
cried
the
secretary
forgetting
all
about
losing
his
seat
to
crowd
up
to
the
table
say
if
that
family
has
got
all
that
richness
what
do
you
want
the
club
to
do
oh
said
polly
turning
her
shining
eyes
on
him
there
are
ever
and
ever
so
many
things
the
boys
and
that
girl
will
need
and
grandpapa
says
that
they
think
a
great
deal
more
of
help
if
some
young
people
take
hold
of
it
and
so
i
sure
i
should
she
added
it
strikes
me
that
i
should
too
declared
pickering
all
his
laziness
gone
and
getting
his
long
figure
out
of
the
chair
he
cried
i
move

that
we
here
he
waved
his
hands
in
a
sweeping
gesture
the
salisbury
club
and
our
club
unite
in
a
plan
to
do
something
for
that
family
i
second
the
motion
the
secretary
cried
out
much
to
surprise
for
polly
was
all
ready
to
do
it
if
no
one
else
offered
to
so
the
vote
was
carried
unanimously
amid
the
greatest
enthusiasm
now
what
shall

do
cried
the
president
jumping
to
his
feet
let
us
strike
while
the
iron
is
hot

library

it
down
and
smiled
at
the
merry
din
that
reached
him
even
at
such
a
distance
and
another
cried
the
president
doing
his
best
to
make
himself
heard

as
there
was
a
single
no

the
ayes

it
of
course
and
after
that
they
talked
so
long
over
the
general
plan
that

king
at
last
had
to
send
a
very
special
invitation
to

with
a
dance
with
one
or
two

great
satisfaction

polly
pepper
and
it
is
going

alexia
obstinately
and
wrinkling
up
her
brows
see
those
awful
horrid
clouds
girls
she
pointed
tragically
up
to
the
sky
do
look
at
them
advised
polly

on
girls
i
challenge
you
to
a
race
as
far
as
the
wicket
gate
away
she
dashed
with
a
bevy
at
her
heels
alexia
not
to
be
left
behind
staring
at
the
sky
went
racing
after
wait
she
screamed
the
racers
however
spent
no
time
attending
to
laggards
but
ran
on
polly
dashed
ahead
and
touched
the
green
wicket
gate
oh
polly
got
there
first
almost
immediately
came
another
girl
fingers
on
it
no
i
do
think
so
panted
polly
philena
got
there
just
about
as
soon
no
you

first
said
the
girl
who
plunged
up
next
i
saw
it
distinctly
well
it
was
so
near
that
we
ought
to
have
another
race
to
decide
it
declared
polly
with
a
little
laugh
pushing
back
the
damp
rings
of
hair
from
her
forehead
girls
is
it
lovely
that
we
have
this
splendid
place
where
we
can
run
and
nobody
see
us
yes
said
alexia
throwing
herself
down
on
the
grass
which
example
was
immediately
followed
by
all
the
other
girls
i
just
love
this
avenue
down
to
the
wicket
gate
polly
pepper
so
do
i
chimed
in
the
others
oh

me
i
just
toasted
and
fried
declared
alexia
i
never
so
hot
in
all
my
life
you
shouldn
have
run
so
alexia
said
polly
reproachfully
patting
the
arm
still
in
its
sling
oh
how
could
you
well
did
you
suppose
i
was
going
to
see
you
all
sprinting
off
and
having
such
fun
and
not
try
it
too
no
indeed
that
asking
too
much
polly
then
she
threw
herself
at
full
length
on
the
grass
and
gazed
at
her
meditatively
well
we
must
have
the
second
race
philena
said
polly
because
if
alexia
runs
again
it
surely
will
hurt
her
exclaimed
alexia
flouncing
up
so
suddenly
that
she
nearly
overthrew
amy
garrett
who
was
sitting
next
and
who
violently
protested
against
such
treatment
now
i
wo
keep
you
back
polly
oh
dear
me
it
ca
hurt
me
a
single
bit
i
all
ready
to
take
off
this
horrible
old
thing
you
know
i
am
only
fisher
thought
he
thought
it
would
be
safer
to
keep
it
on
till
after
the
picnic
polly
was
guilty
of
interrupting
you
know
he
said
so
alexia
no

girls
polly
brought
up
quite
decidedly
polly
you
shall
i
wo
run
i
really
wo
i
shut
my
eyes
and
alexia
squinted
up
her
pale
eyes
till
her
face
was
drawn
up
in
a
knot
i
turn
my
back
i
do
anything
if
you
only
race
try
it
again
polly
so
polly
seeing
that
alexia
really
wished
it
dropped
a
kiss
on
each
of
the
closed
eyes
put
your
hand
over
them
and
untwist
your
face
from
that
funny
knot
she
laughed
come
on
girls
and
the
race
began
alexia
twisted
and
wriggled
as
the
pattering
feet
and
quick
breath
of
the
girls
when
they
neared
her
resting
place
plunged
her
in
dreadful
distress
not
to
look
oh
dear
um
if
i
could
just
see
once
um
i
know
polly
will
win
oh
dear
she
but
she
did
it
was
cathie
harrison
the
new
girl
that
is
new
to
them
as
they
had
drawn
her
into
their
set
but
a
few
weeks
she
was
a
tall
thin
girl
who
got
over
the
ground
amazingly
to
touch
the
green
wicket
gate
certainly
three
seconds
before
polly
pepper
came
flying
up
you
did
that
just
splendidly
cathie
cried
polly
breathlessly
oh
dear
me
that
a
race

cried
alexia
her
eyes
flying
open
my
face
never
get
out
of
that
knot
in
all
this
world
my
i
feel
as
if
my
jaws
were
all
tied
up
well
polly
this
time
you
beat
for
sure
she
added
confidently
as
the
girls
came
running
up
to
throw
themselves
on
the
grass
again
but
i
did
said
polly
merrily
oh
dear
i
so
hot
yes
you
did
declared
alexia
stubbornly
why
alexia
rhys
i
did
beat
any
such
a
thing

polly
not
a
single
bit
of
it
well
who

then
demanded
alexia
quite
angry
to
have
polly
defeated
why
cathie
did
said
polly
smiling
over
at
her
what
that
old
then
alexia
pulled
herself
up
but
it
was
too
late
a
dull
red
mounted
to
cathie
sallow
cheek
that
had
changed
color
during
all
the
two
races
she
drew
a
long
breath
then
got
up
slowly
to
her
feet
i
going
to
play
announced
polly
briskly
come
on
girls

cathie
hurrying
up
to
wedge
herself
into
the
group
and
speaking
to
polly
no

polly

going
to
play
come
on
cathie
she
tried
to
draw
cathie
hand
within
her
arm
but
the
girl
pulled
herself
away
i
must
go
home
and
she
started
off
cathie
wait
but
again
cathie
beat
her
on
a
swift
run
down
the
avenue
alexia
stuffed
her
fingers
regardless
of
arm
in
the
sling
or
anything
into
her
mouth
and
rolled
over
in
dreadful
distress
face
downward
on
the
grass
the
other
girls
stood
in
a
frightened
little
knot
just
where
they
were
without
moving
as
polly
came
slowly
back
down
the
avenue
she
was
quite
white
now
oh
dear
groaned
philena
look
at
polly
alexia
heard
it
and
stuffed
her
fingers
worse
than
ever
into
her
mouth
to
keep
herself
from
screaming
outright
and
wriggled
dreadfully
but
no
one
paid
any
attention
to
her
she
knew
that
polly
had
joined
the
girls
now
she
could
hear
them
talking
and
polly
was
saying
in
a
sad
little
voice
yes
i
afraid
she
wo
ever
come
with
us
again
she
must
she
shall
howled
alexia
rolling
over
and
sitting
up
straight
oh
polly
she
shall
and
she
wrung
her
long
hands
as
well
as
she
could
for
the
arm
in
the
sling
oh
no
i
am
afraid
not
alexia
and
her
head
drooped
no
one
would
have
thought
for
a
moment
that
it
was
polly
pepper
speaking
and
then
amy
garrett
said
the
very
worst
thing
possible
and
just
think
of
that
picnic
and
after
that
remark
the
whole
knot
of
girls
was
plunged
into
the
depths
of
gloom
jasper
running
down
the
avenue
with
pickering
dodge
at
his
heels
found
them
so
and
was
transfixed
with
astonishment
well
i
declare
he
burst
into
a
merry
laugh
you
look
like
a
lot
of
wax
figures
said
pickering
pleasantly
just
about
as
interesting
then
they
saw
polly
pepper
face
oh
what
is
it
cried
jasper
starting
forward
polly
tried
to
speak
cheerfully
but
the
lump
in
her
throat
would
let
her
say
a
word
if
you
boys
must
know

alexia
flouncing
up
to
her
feet

bad
and
perfectly
horrid

harrison
girl

i
upset

and

of
you

jasper
gaining
her
side
ca
we

dreadfully
distressed

her
head
no
jasper
there
is
anything
you
can
do
she
said
brokenly
pickering
thrust
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
whistled
softly
girls
always
get
into
such
rows
he
observed
well
i
guess
we
do
get
into
worse
ones
than
you
boys
do
nor
half
as
bad
cried
alexia
crossly
perfectly
wild
to
quarrel
with
somebody
and
besides
this
is
the
other
girls
fault
it
all
my
fight
from
beginning
to
end
then
you
ought
to
be
perfectly
ashamed
of
yourself
alexia
declared
pickering
not
intending
to
mince
matters
in
the
slightest
well
i
am
said
alexia
just
as
ashamed
as
i
can
be
oh
dear
me
i
wish
i
could
cry
but
i
too
bad
to
cry
polly
pepper
i
going
to
run
after
that
horrible
harrison
girl
oh
misery
i
wish
she
never
had
come
to
the
salisbury
school
alexia
made
a
mad
rush
down
the
avenue
do
alexia
you
hurt
your
arm
warned
polly
i
do
care
i
hope
i
shall
cried
alexia
recklessly
it
no
use
to
try
to
stop
her
said
jasper
so
let
us
go
up
to
the
house
polly
so
they
started
dismally
enough
the
girls
all
except
polly
going
over
in
sorry
fashion
how
cathie
harrison
would
probably
make
a
fuss
about
the
little
affair
she
was
doubtless
on
her
way
to
miss
now
and
then
perhaps
there
would
be
any
picnic
at
all
on
the
morrow
at
this
philena
stopped
short
girls
that
would
be
too
dreadful
she
gasped
for
anything
well
it
would
be
just
like
her
said
silvia
horne
and
i
wish
we
never
had
taken
her
into
our
set
she
an
old
moping
thing
and
bear
a
word
i
wish
so
too
declared
amy
garrett
positively
she
does
belong
with
us
and
she
always
going
to
make
trouble
and
i
hope
she
wo
go
to
the
picnic
anyway
if
we
do
have
it
so
there
i
do
think
that
is
the
way
to
mend
the
matter
amy
said
jasper
gravely
hoh
hoh
exclaimed
pickering
how
you
girls
can
go
on
so
i
see
talking
forever
about
one
thing
instead
of
just
settling
it
with
a
few
fisticuffs
that
would
be
comfortable
now
the
girls
one
and
all
turned
a
cold
shoulder
to
him
after
this
speech
well
we
get
the
picnic
now
i
know
said
philena
tragically
and
think
of
all
our
nice
things
ready
dear
me
our
cook
made
me
the
sweetest
chocolate
cakes
because
we
were
going
to
start
so
early
in
the
morning
now
we
have
them
for
dinner
and
eat
them
up
ourselves
we
might
as
well
you
better
not
advised
pickering
take
my
advice
you
get
your
picnic
all
right
then
where
would
you
be
with
your
cakes
all
eaten
up
you
do
know
miss
salisbury
said
sally
moore
gloomily
nothing
would
make
her
so
mad
as
to
have
us
get
up
a
fuss
with
a
new
scholar
she
was
so
pleased
when
polly
pepper
invited
that
harrison
girl
to
come
to
our
bee
for
that
poor
family
down
south
and
now
just
think
how
we
initiated
her
into
our
club
said
lucy
bennett
with
a
sigh
oh
my
goodness
look
she
pointed
off
down
the
avenue
all
the
girls
whirled
around
to
stare
there
were
alexia
and
cathie
coming
toward
them
arm
in
arm
jasper
polly
turned
to
him
with
shining
eyes
see
then
she
broke
away
from
them
all
and
rushed
to
meet
the
two
girls
there
is
anybody
going
to
say
a
word
announced
alexia
as
the
three
girls
came
up
to
the
group
polly
pepper
in
the
middle
because
as
i
told
you
it
was
all
my
fight
anyway
so
pickering
you
get
ready
to
be
disagreeable
she
flashed
over
at
him
saucily
i
shall
say
just
what
i
think
declared
pickering
flatly
no
doubt
said
alexia
sweetly
but
it
wo
make
a
bit
of
difference
well
now
polly
what
shall
we
do
do
start
us
on
something
we
came
pick
and
i
announced
jasper
to
ask
you
girls
to
have
a
game
of
there
just
time
before
dinner
on
the
south
lawn
polly
oh
good
good
cried
the
girls
clapping
their
hands
come
on
cathie
said
philena
awkwardly
determined
to
break
the
ice
at
once
yes
cathie
come
on
said
amy
and
silvia
trying
to
be
very
nice
cathie
just
got
her
mouth
ready
to
say
no
i
thank
you
primly
thought
better
of
it
and
before
she
quite
realized
it
herself
there
she
was
hurrying
by
a
short
cut
across
the
grass
to
the
south
lawn
i
going
to
stay
with
alexia
said
polly
when
they
all
reached
there
and
jasper
flew
over
to
pull
out
the
from
their
box
under
the
piazza
come
on
alexia
let
you
and
i
sit
in
the
hammock
and
watch
it
oh
polly
come
and
play
begged
jasper
pausing
with
his
arms
full
here
pick
you
lazy
dog
help
with
these
bags
ca
said
polly
shaking
her
head
so
alexia
and
she
curled
up
in
one
of
the
hammocks
i
just
dying
to
tell
you
all
about
it
polly
pepper
said
alexia
pulling
polly
cheek
down
to
her
own
yes
said
polly
happily
and
i
ca
wait
to
hear
it
and
besides
you
ca
play
alexia
with
that
arm
well
do
go
on
and
polly
was
in
quite
a
twitter
for
the
story
to
begin
you
see
said
alexia
i
knew
something
desperate
had
got
to
be
done
polly
for
she
was
crying
all
over
her
best
silk
waist
oh
dear
me
exclaimed
polly
aghast
yes
she
had
sat
down
on
the
kitchen
step
the
kitchen
step
repeated
polly
faintly
yes
i
suppose
she
got
beyond
caring
whether
the
cook
saw
or
not
she
was
feeling
so
very
badly
well
there
she
was
and
she
did
hear
me
so
i
just
rushed
up
or
rather
down
upon
her
and
then
i
screamed
and
she
jumped
up
and
said
have
you
hurt
your
arm
and
i
held
on
to
it
hard
and
made
up
an
awful
face
oh
as
bad
as
i
could
and
doubled
up
and
the
cook
came
to
the
door
and
said
could
she
get
me
anything
and
she
was
going
to
call
fisher
that
would
have
been
terrible
alexia
broke
off
short
and
drew
a
long
breath
at
her
remembrance
of
the
fright
this
suggestion
had
given
her
and
cathie
fell
right
on
my
neck
with
do
forgive
me
and
i
said
was
my
fault
and
she
said
no
she
ought
to
have
got
mad
and
i
said
she
must
hold
her
tongue
oh
alexia
cried
polly
reprovingly
i
had
to
said
alexia
serenely
or
we
should
have
gotten
into
another
fight
and
she
said
she
would
and
i
just
took
hold
of
her
arm
and
dragged
her
down
here
and
i
tired
to
death
finished
alexia
plaintively
alexia
exclaimed
polly
cuddling
up
the
long
figure
in
a
way
to
give
perfect
satisfaction
we
must
make
cathie
harrison
have
the
best
time
that
she
ever
had
at
the
picnic
i
suppose
so
said
alexia
resignedly
well
but
do
let
think
of
it
now
for
i
got
you
polly
and
i
want
to
rest
xiii
the
picnic
the
four
barges
were
to
leave
the
salisbury
school
at
precisely
eight
the
next
morning
miss
salisbury
was
always
very
particular
about
being
prompt
so
woe
be
to
any
girl
who
might
be
late
there
was
great
scurrying
therefore
to
and
fro
in
the
homes
of
the
day
scholars
and
the
girls
hurried
off
with
maids
behind
carrying
their
baskets
or
as
the
case
might
be
big
family
carriages
filled
with
groups
of
girls
collected
among
those
of
a
set
or
in
little
pony
carriages
all
this
made
the
thoroughfares
adjacent
to
the
salisbury
school
extremely
busy
places
indeed
mother
fisher
sent
polly
basket
over
to
the
school
at
an
early
hour
polly
preferring
to
walk
several
of
the
girls
having
called
for
her
so
they
all
with
jasper
who
was
going
as
far
as
the
corner
with
them
set
out
amidst
a
chatter
of
merry
nonsense
oh
girls
i
so
glad
we
are
going
to
the
glen
exclaimed
polly
for
about
the
fiftieth
time
so
am
i
cried
all
the
others
in
a
chorus
why
you
have
ever
been
to
any
other
place
for
your
picnic
have
you
polly
cried
jasper
with
a
laugh
no
said
polly
we
never
have
but
suppose
miss
salisbury
had
decided
to
try
some
other
spot
this
year
oh
just
suppose
it
jasper
and
her
rosy
color
died
down
on
her
cheek
it
would
have
been
just
too
dreadful
for
anything
we
could
have
had
our
picnic
in
any
other
place
declared
rose
harding
it
would
be
the
same
unless
it
was
at
the
glen
dear
old
glen
cried
polly
impulsively
jasper
it
too
bad
you
boys
ca
all
come
to
our
picnics
i
know
it
it
would
be
no
end
jolly
if
we
only
could
said
jasper
regretfully
to
whom
it
was
a
great
grief
that
the
picnic
could
take
in
the
two
schools
yes
said
polly
with
a
sigh
it
would
jasper
but
miss
salisbury
never
will
in
all
this
world
let
the
boys
school
join
no
i
suppose
not
said
jasper
stifling
his
longing
well
you
must
tell
me
about
it
the
same
as
always
polly
yes
i
will
jasper
promised
polly
so
he
turned
the
corner
to
go
to
his
school
but
presently
he
heard
rapid
footsteps
back
of
him
oh
jasper
cried
polly
flushed
and
panting
as
he
whirled
about
tell
phronsie
i
wo
forget
the
little
be
sure
jasper
all
right
i
will
said
jasper
dear
me
do
hurry
back
polly
be
late
oh
no
there
are
oceans
of
time
said
polly
with
a
little
laugh
i
the
tin
case
in
my
picnic
basket
jasper
so
they
will
keep
all
fresh
and
nice
yes
do
hurry
back
begged
jasper
so
polly
with
a
merry
nod
raced
off
to
the
corner
where
the
girls
were
drawn
up
in
a
knot
impatiently
waiting
for
her
every
bit
of
the
fuss
and
parade
in
getting
the
big
company
started
for
all
the
scholars
went
to
the
annual
picnic
was
a
special
delight
to
the
girls
the
only
trouble
was
that
the
seats
were
not
all
end
ones
while
the
favorite
places
up
by
the
driver
were
necessarily
few
in
each
vehicle
come
on
polly
screamed
alexia
everybody
had
agreed
that
she
should
have
one
of
these
choice
positions
because
of
her
lame
arm
which
fisher
had
said
must
be
carried
in
its
sling
this
day
so
there
she
was
calling
lustily
for
polly
pepper
and
beating
the
cushion
impatiently
with
her
well
hand
oh
hurry
up
polly
down
on
the
ground
in
a
swarm
of
girls
shook
her
head
no
her
lips
said
softly
so
that
no
one
but
alexia
who
was
leaning
over
for
that
purpose
could
possibly
hear
ask
cathie
oh
bother
exclaimed
alexia
with
a
frown
then
she
smothered
it
up
with
a
come
polly
very
persuasively
ca
said
polly
i
going
back
here
and
she
moved
down
to
the
end
of
the
barge
then
i
going
back
too
alexia
gave
a
frantic
dive
to
get
down
from
the
barge
miss
salisbury
saw
it
and
as
she
had
planned
to
give
alexia
just
that
very
pleasure
of
riding
on
the
front
seat
she
was
naturally
somewhat
disturbed
no
no
my
dear
seeing
alexia
efforts
to
get
down
stay
where
you
are
oh
dear
me
alexia
craned
her
long
neck
around
the
side
of
the
vehicle
to
spy
polly
movements
i
do
want
to
be
mewed
up
here
she
cried
discontentedly
but
miss
salisbury
feeling
well
satisfied
with
her
plan
for
making
alexia
happy
had
moved
off
and
the
babel
and
tumult
waged
so
high
over
the
placing
of
the
big
company
all
the
girls
chattering
and
laughing
at
once
that
alexia
call
as
she
might
began
to
despair
of
attracting
polly
attention
or
cathie
either
for
that
matter
you
better
set
down
said
the
driver
an
old
man
whom
miss
salisbury
employed
every
year
to
superintend
the
business
and
make
yourself
comfortable
but
i
not
in
the
least
comfortable
said
alexia
passionately
and
i
do
want
to
be
up
here
i
want
to
get
down
but
you
ca
the
old
man
seemed
to
fairly
enjoy
her
dismay
she
you
know
pointing
a
short
square
thumb
over
his
shoulder
in
the
direction
of
miss
salisbury
told
ye
to
set
still
so
ye
better
set
but
alexia
craned
her
neck
yet
more
and
called
insistently
polly
oh
polly
miss
anstice
looked
up
from
the
bevy
of
girls
she
was
settling
in
another
barge
alexia
rhys
she
said
severely
you
must
be
quiet
it
is
impossible
to
get
started
unless
all
you
girls
are
going
to
be
tractable
and
obedient
miss
anstice
alexia
formed
a
sudden
bold
resolve
please
come
here
i
want
you
very
much
she
said
sweetly
miss
anstice
pleased
to
be
wanted
very
much
or
indeed
at
all
left
her
work
and
went
over
to
the
front
barge
where
alexia
was
raging
inwardly
miss
anstice
i
need
polly
pepper
up
next
to
me
said
alexia
oh
so
much
she
knows
all
about
my
arm
you
know
her
father
fixed
it
for
me
will
you
please
have
her
come
up
here
then
if
i
should
feel
worse
she
could
help
me
miss
anstice
peered
here
and
there
in
her
nearsighted
fashion
i
see
polly
pepper
she
said
there
she
is
there
she
is
cried
alexia
trembling
in
every
limb
for
her
plan
could
not
be
said
to
be
a
complete
success
yet
and
pointing
eagerly
to
the
end
of
her
barge
she
the
fourth
from
the
door
miss
anstice
oh
how
lovely
you
are
miss
anstice
quite
overcome
to
be
told
she
was
lovely
and
especially
by
alexia
who
had
previously
given
her
no
reason
to
suppose
that
she
entertained
any
such
opinion
went
with
great
satisfaction
down
the
length
of
the
barge
and
standing
on
her
tiptoes
said
very
importantly
polly
pepper
i
want
to
place
you
differently
so
polly
quite
puzzled
but
very
obedient
crawled
out
from
her
seat
where
she
was
wedged
in
between
two
girls
not
of
her
set
who
had
been
perfectly
radiant
at
their
good
fortune
and
clambering
down
the
steps
was
almost
before
she
knew
it
installed
up
on
the
front
row
by
alexia
side
oh
polly
what
richness
exclaimed
that
individual
in
smothered
accents
as
miss
anstice
stepped
off
in
much
importance
and
hugging
polly
i
so
glad
my
sling
is
on
for
i
never
gotten
you
up
here
without
the
old
thing
and
she
giggled
as
she
told
the
story
oh
alexia
exclaimed
polly
quite
shocked
well
i
may
get
a
relapse
in
it
you
do
know
said
alexia
coolly
so
you
really
ought
to
be
up
here
oh
my
goodness

forgot
this
man
she
brought
up
suddenly

peered
around
anxiously
past
polly
ef

set
still
i
wo

that
teacher
said
the
old
man
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
but

i
should
think
you
could
ef
you
set
out
to
i
up
an

whole
thing
to
her
oh
i
sit
as
still
as
a
mouse
promised
alexia
oh
polly

he
a
horrible
old
thing
in
a
stage
whisper
under
cover
of
the
noise
going
on
around
them
hush
said
polly
well
i
not
going
to
hush
cried
alexia
recklessly
i
going
to
have
a
good
time
at
the
picnic
and
do
just
everything
i
want
to
so
there
polly
pepper

well

polly
then
when
we
get
to
the
glen
i
shall
go
off
with
the
other
girls
alexia
which
had
the
desired
effect
alexia
curled
up
into
her
corner
and
hanging
to
polly
pepper
arm
was
just
like
a
mouse
for
quiet
and
off
they
went
the
old
man
whip
going
crack
as
he
led
the
way
with
a
grand
flourish
as
much
better
than
his
efforts
of
former
years
as
was
possible
the
road
led
through
winding
woodsy
paths
redolent
of
sweet
fern
the
girls
never
tired
of
its
delights
exclaiming
at
all
the
sights
and
sounds
of
country
life
at
all
such
moments
as
were
not
filled
to
the
brim
with
the
songs
that
ran
over
from
their
happy
hearts
so
on
and
up
they
went
to
the
glen
a
precipitous
ravine
some
fifteen
miles
out
from
the
city
when
the
barges
finally
drew
up
with
another
grand
flourish
at
the
entrance
a
smooth
grassy
plateau
shaded
by
oaks
and
drooping
elms
they
simply
poured
out
a
stream
of
girls
from
each
conveyance
the
old
man
and
his
companion
drivers
laughing
to
see
them
tumble
out
pretty
quick
work
eh
bill
said
old
man
kimball
no
screaming
for
first
places
now
it
the
same
beautiful
dear
old
glen
exclaimed
polly
with
kindling
eyes
and
dancing
feet
oh
alexia
come
on
and
seizing
the
well
hand
they
spun
round
and
round
unable
to
keep
still
having
plenty
of
company
all
the
other
girls
following
suit
polly
looked
at
her
little
watch
in
five
minutes
we
must
stop
be
time
to
get
the
flowers
oh
can
we
cried
alexia
misery
me
i
so
tired
cooped
up
in
that
barge
i
feel
stiff
as
a
jointed
doll
polly
pepper
well
i
do
said
polly
dancing
away
for
dear
life
oh
alexia
when
miss
salisbury
gives
the
signal
to
explore
wo
it
be
just
fun
i
should
say
cried
alexia
unable
to
find
words
that
would
just
express
the
case
there
was
always
one
routine
to
be
observed
in
the
annual
picnic
of
the
salisbury
school
and
no
one
thought
for
a
moment
of
deviating
from
it
the
maids
collected
the
baskets
taken
from
the
wagons
and
set
them
in
a
cool
shady
place
among
the
rocks
just
within
the
glen
the
girls
ran
hither
and
thither
to
collect
flowers
and
ferns
to
drape
miss
salisbury
seat
of
honor
and
one
as
near
like
it
as
possible
for
miss
anstice
these
were
big
crevices
in
the
rocks
that
were
as
comfortable
as
chairs
and
having
backs
to
them
in
the
shape
of
boulders
they
were
truly
luxurious
indeed
miss
salisbury
had
declared
when
the
seats
were
discovered
by
polly
pepper
at
the
first
picnic
after
she
joined
the
salisbury
school
that
she
never
sat
in
one
more
comfortable
and
she
was
so
pleased
when
she
was
led
to
it
and
inducted
therein
all
with
little
vines
trailing
off
and
arching
over
her
head
why
my
dears
she
exclaimed
quite
overcome
oh
how
pretty
and
how
did
you
think
of
it
it
was
polly
pepper
who
thought
of
it
said
a
parlor
boarder
and
polly
blushing
rosy
red
a
new
girl
as
she
was
was
led
up
and
miss
salisbury
set
a
kiss
on
her
round
cheek
polly
never
forgot
how
happy
she
was
that
day
and
afterward
when
the
girls
were
busy
in
various
little
groups
miss
salisbury
had
beckoned
polly
to
her
side
where
she
reposed
on
her
throne
for
it
was
beautiful
and
stately
enough
for
one
and
quite
worthy
of
royalty
itself
polly
said
miss
salisbury
in
quite
a
low
tone
only
fitted
for
polly
ear
do
you
think
you
could
find
a
seat
like
this
beautiful
one
of
mine
for
sister
i
should
really
enjoy
it
so
very
much
more
if
sister
had
one
also
and
she
would
prize
the
attention
very
much
polly
from
you
girls
so
polly
fired
with
the
laudable
desire
to
find
one
exactly
like
miss
salisbury
very
own
for
sister
at
last
was
just
so
fortunate
so
that
was
also
with
trailing
vines
to
finish
it
off
with
and
every
year
the
first
thing
the
girls
did
after
dancing
around
a
bit
to
rest
their
feet
after
the
long
drive
was
to
set
to
work
to
collect
the
vines
and
ferns
and
decorate
the
two
stone
seats
then
with
quite
a
good
deal
of
pomp
and
ceremony
the
girls
escorted
the
two
teachers
to
their
thrones
unpacked
the
little
bag
of
books
and
magazines
and
arranged
some
cushions
and
shawls
about
them
and
then
miss
salisbury
always
said
with
a
sweet
smile
thank
you
my
dears
and
miss
anstice
said
the
same
although
try
as
hard
as
she
would
her
smile
never
could
be
sweet
like
miss
salisbury
and
then
off
the
girls
would
go
to
exploring
as
they
called
rambling
in
the
glen
the
taking
them
in
charge
and
now
polly
pepper
ran
to
her
hamper
which
she
saw
in
a
pile
where
the
baskets
had
been
heaped
by
the
maids
there
it
is
pointing
to
the
tag
sticking
up
oh
help
me
not
you
alexia
as
alexia
ran
up
as
usual
to
help
forward
any
undertaking
polly
pepper
might
have
in
mind
dear
me
you
might
almost
kill
your
arm
this
old
arm
cried
alexia
i
sick
and
tired
of
it
well
you
better
take
care
of
it
cried
polly
gaily
and
then
it
wo
be
an
old
arm
but
it
will
be
as
good
as
brand
new
alexia
oh
one
of
the
other
girls
do
come
and
help
me
what
do
you
want
polly
cried
some
of
the
girls
racing
up
to
her
i
want
to
get
out
my
hamper
said
polly
pointing
to
the
tag
sticking
up
high
and
dry
amid
a
stack
of
baskets
my
tin
botany
case
is
in
it
i
must
get
the
ferns
i
promised
to
bring
home
to
phronsie
you
stand
away
all
of
ye
the
old
man
kimball
his
horses
out
of
the
shafts
and
well
taken
care
of
now
drew
near
and
swept
off
with
his
ample
hand
the
bunch
of
girls
which
one
oh
that
ere
one
with
the
tag
answering
his
own
question
well
now
i
git
that
for
you
jest
as
easy
as
rolling
off
a
log
one
two
three
there
she
comes
and
one
two
three
and
here
she
did
come
and
in
a
trice
polly
had
the
cover
up
and
out
flew
the
little
green
tin
botany
case
and
within
it
being
an
iron
spoon
and
little
trowel
off
flew
polly
on
happy
feet
to
unearth
the
treasures
that
were
to
beautify
phronsie
little
garden
a
bunch
of
girls
following
to
see
the
operation
the
magazine
fell
idly
to
the
lap
of
miss
salisbury
she
sat
dreamily
back
resting
her
head
against
the
boulder
sister
she
said
softly
this
is
a
happy
custom
we
have
started
i
trust
nothing
will
ever
prevent
our
holding
our
annual
picnic
yes
said
miss
anstice
absently
she
was
very
much
interested
in
a
story
she
had
begun
and
she
hated
to
have
miss
salisbury
say
a
word
although
she
had
on
a
stiff
immaculate
white
gown
for
on
such
a
festival
as
the
annual
picnic
she
always
dressed
in
white
still
she
was
not
in
the
same
sweet
temper
that
the
principal
was
enjoying
and
she
held
her
thumb
and
finger
in
the
place
yes
the
picnic
is
very
good
she
said
feeling
that
something
was
expected
of
her
if
we
did
get
worms
and
bugs
crawling
over
the
tablecloth
oh
sister
exclaimed
miss
salisbury
quite
shocked
it
is
no
time
to
think
of
worms
and
bugs
i
sure
on
such
a
beautiful
occasion
as
this
still
they
are
here
said
miss
anstice
there
is
one
now
looking
down
at
the
hem
of
her
gown
go
right
away
slapping
her
book
at
it
then
her
thumb
and
finger
flew
out
and
she
lost
her
place
and
the
bug
ran
away
and
she
added
somewhat
tartly
for
my
own
taste
i
should
really
prefer
a
festival
in
the
schoolroom
when
it
came
to
spreading
the
feast
not
one
of
the
maids
was
allowed
to
serve
they
could
unpack
the
hampers
and
hand
the
dishes
and
eatables
to
the
girls
and
run
and
wait
and
tend
but
no
one
but
the
salisbury
girls
must
lay
the
snowy
cloth
dress
it
up
with
flowers
with
little
knots
at
the
corners
concealing
the
big
stones
that
kept
the
tablecloth
from
flapping
in
any
chance
wind
and
then
they
all
took
turns
in
setting
the
feast
forth
and
arranging
all
the
goodies
and
some
one
had
to
make
the
coffee
with
a
little
coterie
to
help
her
the
crotched
sticks
were
always
there
just
as
they
had
left
them
where
they
hung
the
kettle
over
the
stone
oven
and
old
man
kimball
set
one
of
the
younger
drivers
to
make
the
fire
and
a
rousing
good
one
it
was
where
they
roasted
their
corn
and
potatoes
and
another
one
brought
up
the
water
from
the
spring
that
bubbled
up
clear
and
cold
in
the
rocky
ravine
so
when
all
was
ready
it
was
a
feast
fit
for
a
king
or
rather
the
queen
and
her
royal
subjects
and
then
miss
salisbury
and
sister
were
escorted
with
all
appropriate
ceremonies
down
from
their
stone
thrones
and
one
had
the
head
and
the
other
the
foot
of
the
feast
spread
on
the
grass
to
sit
on
a
stone
draped
with
a
shawl
and
to
be
waited
on
lovingly
by
the
girls
who
threw
themselves
down
on
the
ground
surrounding
the
snowy
cloth
and
they
sat
two
or
three
rows
deep
and
those
in
the
front
row
had
to
pass
the
things
of
course
to
the
girls
oh
you
spilling
crumbs
all
down
my
back
proclaimed
alexia
with
a
shudder
rose
harding
looking
at
the
girl
just
back
of
her
ca
you
eat
over
your
own
lap
pray
tell
well
give
me
your
seat
then
suggested
rose
with
another
good
bite
from
the
crumbly
piece
in
her
hand
if
you
do
like
what
the
girls
do
no
i
not
going
to
said
alexia
catch
me
but
you
need
eat
all
over
my
hair
ugh
there
goes
another
and
she
squirmed
so
she
knocked
off
the
things
in
her
neighbor
as
well
as
her
own
lap
oh
dear
me
keep
your
feet
to
yourself
alexia
rhys
said
the
neighbor
there
goes
my
egg
in
all
the
dirt
and
i
just
gotten
it
shelled
all
the
easier
for
the
bugs
observed
alexia
sweetly
see
already
appropriating
it
and
i
guess
you
kick
and
wriggle
if
some
one
put
jelly
cake
down
your
back
returning
to
her
grievance
slippery
slimy
jelly
cake
twisting
again
at
the
remembrance
well
you
need
kick
the
things
out
of
my
lap
i
did
put
the
jelly
cake
down
your
back
retorted
the
neighbor
beginning
to
shell
her
second
egg
oh
dear
was
ever
anything
quite
so
good
in
all
this
world
as
that
feast
at
the
salisbury
picnic
i
did
suppose
those
baskets
could
bring
out
so
much
nor
such
perfectly
delicious
things
sighed
polly
pepper
in
an
interval
of
rest
before
attacking
one
of
philena
chocolate
cakes
polly
polly
pepper
called
a
girl
opposite
give
me
one
of
your
little
lemon
tarts
you
did
bring
this
year
did
you
anxiously
yes
indeed
answered
polly
why
where
are
they
peering
up
and
down
the
festal
not
board
but
tablecloth
do
tell
me
they
are
gone
cried
the
girl
leaning
over
to
look
for
herself
i
afraid
they
are
said
polly
oh
i
so
sorry
agatha
you
should
have
spoken
before
my
child
said
a
parlor
boarder
who
had
eaten
only
three
of
fisher
tarts
and
adjusting
her
eyeglasses
why
i
only
just
gotten
through
eating
bread
and
butter
said
agatha
i
ca
eat
cake
until
that
done
a
foolish
waste
of
time
observed
the
parlor
boarder
bread
and
butter
is
for
every
day
cake
and
custards
and
flummery
for
high
holidays
she
added
with
quite
an
air
hush
up
do
cried
alexia
who
had
small
respect
for
the
parlor
boarders
and
their
graces
and
eat
what
you
like
penelope
i
going
to
ransack
this
table
for
a
tart
for
you
agatha
she
sent
keen
glances
all
up
and
down
the
length
of
the
tablecloth
yes
no
yes
it
is
she
pounced
upon
a
lemon
tart
hiding
under
a
spray
of
sweet
fern
and
handed
it
in
triumph
across
there
you
are
agatha
now
do
say
i
never
did
anything
for
you
oh
how
sweet
cried
agatha
burying
her
teeth
in
the
flaky
tart
i
should
think
it
was
sour
observed
amy
garrett
lemons
usually
are
do
try
to
be
clever
amy
child
said
alexia
it
is
expected
at
a
picnic
it
never
expected
where
you
are
retorted
amy
sharply
oh
dear
dear
that
pretty
good
cried
alexia
nowise
disconcerted
as
she
loved
a
joke
just
as
much
at
herself
as
at
the
expense
of
any
one
else
while
the
others
burst
into
a
merry
laugh
there
one
good
thing
about
alexia
rhys
the
salisbury
girls
had
always
said
she
can
take
any
amount
of
chaff
and
not
stick
her
finger
in
her
eye
and
whimper
so
now
she
smiled
serenely
oh
dear
dear
i
wish
i
could
eat
some
more
she
said
i
have
tasted
your
orange
jelly
clem
nor
as
much
as
looked
at
your
french
sandwiches
silvia
what
is
the
reason
one
can
eat
so
very
little
at
a
picnic
i
wonder
she
drew
a
long
breath
and
regarded
them
all
with
a
very
injured
expression
hear
that
girls
cried
silvia
is
that
rich
when
alexia
has
been
eating
every
blessed
minute
just
as
fast
as
she
could
i
suppose
that
is
what
we
all
have
been
doing
observed
alexia
placidly
miss
salisbury
had
been
a
happy
observer
of
all
the
fun
and
nonsense
going
on
around
her
and
renewing
her
youth
when
she
had
dearly
loved
picnics
but
it
was
not
so
with
miss
anstice
at
the
foot
of
the
festal
tablecloth
she
had
been
viewing
from
the
corners
of
her
eyes
the
inroads
of
various
specimens
of
the
insect
creation
and
several
other
peripatetic
creatures
that
seemed
to
belong
to
no
particular
species
but
to
a
new
order
of
beings
originated
for
this
very
occasion
she
had
held
herself
in
bravely
although
eating
little
being
much
too
busy
in
keeping
watch
of
these
intruders
who
all
seemed
bent
on
running
over
her
food
and
her
person
to
hide
in
all
conceivable
folds
of
her
white
gown
and
she
was
now
congratulating
herself
on
the
end
of
the
feast
which
about
this
time
should
be
somewhere
in
sight
when
a
bug
at
least
so
it
seemed
to
her
distraught
vision
pranced
with
agile
steps
directly
for
her
lap
to
disappear
at
once
and
it
got
on
to
her
nerves
oh
take
it
off
miss
anstice
let
her
plate
fly
and
skipped
to
her
feet
but
looking
out
for
the
bug
she
thought
of
little
else
and
stepped
into
some
more
of
the
jelly
cake
slipped
and
precipitated
herself
into
the
middle
of
the
feast
xiv
miss
salisbury
story
oh
miss
anstice
cried
the
salisbury
girls
jumping
to
their
feet
exclaimed
miss
salisbury
dropping
her
plate
and
letting
all
her
sweet
peaceful
reflections
fly
to
the
four
winds
i
never
did
regard
picnics
as
pleasant
affairs
gasped
miss
anstice
as
the
young
hands
raised
her
and
now
they
are
quite
quite
detestable
she
looked
at
her
gown
alas
no
longer
immaculate
if
you
could
wipe
my
hands
first
young
ladies
sticking
out
those
members
on
which
were
plentiful
supplies
of
marmalade
and
jelly
cake
i
should
be
much
obliged
never
mind
the
gown
yet
she
added
with
asperity
i
do
that
cried
alexia
flying
at
her
with
two
or
three
napkins
alexia
keep
your
seat
miss
anstice
turned
on
her
it
is
quite
bad
enough
without
your
heedless
fingers
at
work
on
it
illustration
i
never
did
regard
picnics
as
pleasant
affairs
gasped
miss
anstice
i
wo
touch
the
old
thing
declared
alexia
in
a
towering
passion
and
forgetting
it
was
not
one
of
the
girls
and
i
may
be
heedless
but
i
be
polite
and
she
threw
down
the
napkins
and
turned
her
back
on
the
whole
thing
alexia
cried
polly
turning
very
pale
and
rushing
up
to
her
she
bore
her
away
under
the
trees
why
alexia
rhys
you
talked
awfully
to
miss
anstice
just
think
the
sister
of
our
miss
salisbury
was
that
old
thing
a
salisbury
asked
alexia
quite
unmoved
i
thought
it
was
a
rude
creature
that
did
know
what
it
was
to
have
good
manners
alexia
alexia
mourned
polly
and
for
the
first
time
in
remembrance
wringing
her
hands
to
think
you
should
do
such
a
thing
alexia
seeing
polly
wring
her
hands
felt
quite
aghast
at
herself
polly
do
do
that
she
begged
oh
i
ca
help
it
and
polly
tears
fell
fast
alexia
gave
her
one
look
as
she
stood
there
quite
still
and
pale
unable
to
stop
the
tears
racing
over
her
cheeks
turned
and
fled
with
long
steps
back
to
the
crowd
of
girls
surrounding
poor
miss
anstice
miss
salisbury
herself
wiping
the
linen
gown
with
an
old
napkin
in
her
deft
fingers
i
beg
your
pardon
cried
alexia
gustily
and
plunging
up
unsteadily
i
was
bad
to
say
such
things
you
were
indeed
assented
miss
anstice
tartly
sister
that
is
quite
enough
the
gown
can
not
possibly
be
made
any
better
with
your
incessant
rubbing
miss
salisbury
gave
a
sigh
and
got
up
from
her
knees
and
put
down
the
napkin
then
she
looked
at
alexia
she
is
very
sorry
sister
she
said
gently
i
am
sure
alexia
regrets
exceedingly
her
hasty
speech
hasty
repeated
miss
anstice
with
acrimony
it
was
quite
impertinent
and
i
can
not
remember
when
one
of
our
young
ladies
has
done
such
a
thing
all
the
blood
in
alexia
body
seemed
to
go
to
her
sallow
cheeks
when
she
heard
that
that
she
should
be
the
first
and
only
salisbury
girl
to
be
so
bad
quite
overcame
her
and
she
looked
around
for
polly
pepper
to
help
her
out
and
polly
who
had
followed
her
up
to
the
group
begged
do
dear
miss
anstice
forgive
her
and
so
did
all
the
girls
even
those
who
did
not
like
alexia
one
bit
feeling
sorry
for
her
now
miss
anstice
relented
enough
to
say
well
we
will
say
no
more
about
it
i
dare
say
you
did
not
intend
to
be
impertinent
and
then
they
all
sat
down
again
and
everybody
tried
to
be
as
gay
as
possible
while
the
feast
went
on
and
by
the
time
they
sang
the
salisbury
school
songs
for
they
had
several
very
fine
ones
that
the
different
classes
had
composed
there
was
such
a
tone
of
good
humor
prevailing
everybody
getting
so
very
jolly
that
no
one
looking
on
would
have
supposed
for
a
moment
that
a
single
unpleasant
note
had
been
struck
and
miss
anstice
tried
not
to
look
at
her
gown
and
miss
salisbury
had
a
pretty
pink
tinge
in
her
cheeks
and
her
eyes
were
blue
and
serene
without
the
tired
look
that
often
came
into
them
now
for
the
story
oh
that
is
the
best
of
all
exclaimed
polly
pepper
when
at
last
protesting
that
they
could
eat
another
morsel
they
all
got
up
from
the
feast
leaving
it
to
the
maids
is
it
echoed
the
girls
oh
dear
miss
salisbury
i
so
glad
it
is
time
for
you
to
tell
it
all
of
which
pleased
miss
salisbury
very
much
indeed
for
it
was
the
custom
at
this
annual
festival
to
wind
up
the
afternoon
with
a
story
by
the
principal
when
all
the
girls
would
gather
at
her
feet
to
listen
to
it
as
she
sat
in
state
in
her
stone
chair
is
it
she
cried
the
pink
tinge
on
her
cheek
getting
deeper
well
do
you
know
i
think
i
enjoy
as
much
as
my
girls
the
telling
of
this
annual
story
oh
you
ca
enjoy
it
said
one
impulsive
young
voice
miss
salisbury
smiled
indulgently
at
her
well
now
if
you
are
ready
girls
i
will
begin
oh
yes
we
are
we
are
the
bright
groups
scattered
on
the
grass
at
her
feet
declared
i
thought
i
would
tell
you
of
my
school
days
when
i
was
as
young
as
you
began
miss
salisbury
oh
oh
miss
salisbury
i
just
love
you
for
that
exclaimed
the
impulsive
girl
and
jumping
out
of
her
seat
she
ran
around
the
groups
to
the
stone
chair
i
do
miss
salisbury
for
i
did
so
want
to
hear
all
about
when
you
were
a
schoolgirl
well
go
back
to
your
place
fanny
and
you
shall
hear
a
little
of
my
school
life
said
miss
salisbury
gently
no
no
the
whole
of
it
begged
fanny
earnestly
going
slowly
back
my
dear
child
i
could
not
possibly
tell
you
the
whole
said
miss
salisbury
smiling
it
must
be
one
little
picture
of
my
school
days
do
sit
down
fanny
cried
one
of
the
other
girls
impatiently
you
are
hindering
it
all
so
fanny
flew
back
to
her
place
and
miss
salisbury
without
any
more
interruptions
began
you
see
girls
you
must
know
to
begin
with
that
our
father
and
mine
was
a
clergyman
in
a
small
country
parish
and
as
there
were
a
great
many
mouths
to
feed
and
young
growing
minds
to
feed
as
well
besides
ours
why
there
was
a
great
deal
of
considering
as
to
ways
and
means
constantly
going
on
at
the
parsonage
well
as
i
was
the
eldest
of
course
the
question
came
first
what
to
do
with
amelia
were
you
amelia
asked
fanny
yes
well
after
talking
it
over
a
great
deal
and
i
suspect
many
sleepless
nights
spent
by
my
good
father
and
mother
it
was
at
last
decided
that
i
should
be
sent
to
boarding
school
for
i
forgot
to
tell
you
i
had
finished
at
the
academy
yes
sister
was
very
smart
broke
in
miss
anstice
proudly
she
tell
you
that
so
i
must
oh
sister
sister
protested
miss
salisbury
yes
she
excelled
all
the
boys
and
girls
did
they
have
boys
at
that
school
interrupted
philena
in
amazement
oh
how
very
nice
miss
salisbury
i
should
just
love
to
go
to
school
with
boys
declared
ever
so
many
of
the
girls
ecstatically
why
do
you
take
boys
at
our
school
miss
salisbury
asked
silvia
longingly
miss
anstice
looked
quite
horrified
at
the
very
idea
but
miss
salisbury
laughed
it
is
not
the
custom
now
my
dear
in
private
schools
in
my
day
you
must
remember
that
was
a
long
time
ago
there
were
academies
where
girls
and
boys
attended
what
would
be
called
a
high
school
now
oh
and
i
went
to
one
in
the
next
town
until
it
was
thought
best
for
me
to
be
sent
to
boarding
school
and
she
was
very
smart
she
took
all
the
prizes
at
the
academy
and
the
principal
said
miss
anstice
was
herself
brought
up
quickly
by
her
sister
if
you
interrupt
so
much
i
never
shall
finish
my
story
anstice
she
said
i
want
the
girls
to
understand
this
said
miss
anstice
with
decision
the
principal
said
she
was
the
best
educated
scholar
he
had
ever
seen
graduated
from
hilltop
academy
well
now
if
you
have
finished
said
miss
salisbury
laughing
i
will
proceed
so
i
was
despatched
by
my
father
to
a
town
about
thirty
miles
away
to
a
boarding
school
kept
by
the
widow
of
a
clergyman
who
had
been
a
college
classmate
well
i
was
sorry
to
leave
all
my
young
brothers
and
sisters
you
may
be
sure
while
my
mother
girls
i
have
even
now
forgotten
the
pang
it
cost
me
to
kiss
my
mother
miss
salisbury
stopped
suddenly
and
let
her
gaze
wander
off
to
the
waving
and
miss
anstice
fell
into
a
revery
that
kept
her
face
turned
away
but
it
was
the
only
way
i
could
get
an
education
and
you
know
i
could
not
be
fitted
for
a
teacher
which
was
to
be
my
life
work
unless
i
went
so
i
stifled
all
those
dreadful
feelings
which
anticipated
my
homesickness
and
pretty
soon
i
found
myself
in
the
boarding
school
how
many
scholars
were
there
miss
salisbury
asked
laura
page
who
was
very
exact
fifteen
girls
said
miss
salisbury
oh
dear
me
what
a
little
bit
of
a
school
exclaimed
one
girl
the
schools
were
not
as
large
in
those
days
said
miss
salisbury
you
must
keep
in
mind
the
great
difference
between
that
time
and
this
my
dear
well
and
when
i
was
once
there
i
had
quite
enough
to
do
to
keep
me
from
being
homesick
i
can
assure
you
through
the
day
because
in
addition
to
lessons
there
was
the
sewing
hour
sewing
oh
my
goodness
me
exclaimed
alexia
you
did
have
to
sew
at
that
school
did
you
miss
salisbury
i
surely
did
replied
miss
salisbury
and
very
glad
i
have
been
alexia
that
i
learned
so
much
in
that
sewing
hour
i
have
seriously
thought
sister
and
i
of
introducing
the
plan
into
our
school
oh
do
miss
salisbury
screamed
the
girls
ple
ase
do
make
us
sew
some
of
them
jumped
to
their
feet
in
distress
i
shall
die
declared
alexia
tragically
if
we
have
to
sew
there
was
such
a
general
gloom
settled
over
the
entire
party
that
miss
salisbury
hastened
to
say
i
do
think
girls
we
can
do
it
because
something
else
equally
important
would
have
to
be
given
up
to
make
the
time
at
which
the
faces
brightened
up
well
i
was
only
to
stay
at
this
school
a
year
went
on
miss
salisbury
because
you
see
it
was
as
much
as
my
father
could
do
to
pay
for
that
time
so
it
was
necessary
to
use
every
moment
to
advantage
so
i
studied
pretty
hard
and
i
presume
this
is
one
reason
why
the
incident
i
am
going
to
tell
you
about
was
of
such
a
nature
for
i
was
though
that
should
be
no
excuse
she
added
hastily
oh
sister
said
miss
anstice
nervously
do
tell
them
that
story
i
would
it
may
help
them
to
have
a
leaf
out
of
another
young
person
life
anstice
said
miss
salisbury
gravely
well
but
and
so
every
time
when
i
thought
i
must
give
up
and
go
home
i
was
so
hungry
to
see
my
father
and
mother
and
the
little
ones
was
miss
anstice
one
of
the
little
ones
asked
fanny
with
a
curious
look
at
the
and
faded
eyes
of
the
younger
miss
salisbury
yes
she
was
there
were
two
boys
came
in
between
then
anstice
then
jane
harriett
lemuel
and
the
baby
oh
my
gasped
alexia
tumbling
over
into
polly
pepper
lap
eight
of
us
so
you
see
it
would
never
do
for
the
one
who
was
having
so
much
money
spent
upon
her
to
waste
a
single
penny
of
it
when
i
once
got
to
teaching
i
was
to
pay
it
all
back
and
did
you
did
you
demanded
curious
fanny
did
she
oh
girls
it
was
miss
anstice
who
almost
gasped
this
making
every
girl
turn
around
never
mind
miss
salisbury
telegraphed
over
their
heads
to
sister
which
kept
her
silent
but
she
meant
to
tell
sometime
polly
pepper
all
this
time
had
moved
but
sat
with
hands
folded
in
her
lap
what
if
she
had
given
up
and
flown
home
to
mamsie
and
the
little
brown
house
before
king
discovered
her
homesickness
and
brought
phronsie
supposing
she
had
gone
in
the
old
stagecoach
that
day
when
she
first
left
badgertown
to
visit
in
jasper
home
just
supposing
it
she
turned
quite
pale
and
held
her
breath
while
miss
salisbury
proceeded
and
now
comes
the
incident
that
occurred
during
that
year
that
i
have
intended
for
some
time
to
tell
you
girls
because
it
may
perhaps
help
you
in
some
experience
where
you
will
need
the
very
quality
that
i
lacked
on
that
occasion
oh
sister
expostulated
miss
anstice
it
was
a
midwinter
day
cold
and
clear
and
piercing
miss
salisbury
shivered
a
bit
and
drew
the
shawl
put
across
the
back
of
her
stone
seat
closer
around
her
ferguson
that
was
the
name
of
the
principal
had
given
the
girls
a
holiday
to
take
them
to
a
neighboring
town
there
was
to
be
a
concert
i
remember
and
some
other
treats
and
the
scholars
were
as
you
would
say
wild
to
go
and
she
smiled
indulgently
at
her
rapt
audience
well
i
was
not
going
oh
miss
salisbury
exclaimed
amy
garrett
in
sorrow
as
if
the
disappointment
were
not
forty
years
in
the
background
no
i
decided
it
was
not
best
for
me
to
take
the
money
although
my
father
had
written
me
that
i
could
when
the
holiday
had
been
planned
some
time
before
and
besides
i
thought
i
could
do
some
extra
studying
ahead
while
the
girls
were
away
understand
i
did
really
think
of
doing
wrong
then
although
afterward
i
did
the
wrong
thing
reproved
miss
anstice
she
could
not
sit
still
now
but
got
out
of
her
stone
chair
and
paced
up
and
down
no
i
did
not
dream
that
in
a
little
while
after
the
party
had
started
i
should
be
so
sorely
tempted
and
the
idea
would
enter
my
head
to
do
the
wrong
thing
but
so
it
was
i
was
studying
i
remember
my
philosophy
lesson
for
some
days
ahead
when
suddenly
as
plainly
as
if
letters
of
light
were
written
down
the
page
it
flashed
upon
my
mind
do
i
go
home
i
can
get
back
and
no
one
will
know
it
at
least
not
until
i
am
back
again
and
no
harm
done
and
without
waiting
to
think
it
out
i
clapped
to
my
book
tossed
it
on
the
table
and
ran
to
get
my
poor
little
purse
out
of
the
bureau
drawer
the
girls
in
their
eagerness
not
to
lose
a
word
crowded
close
to
miss
salisbury
knees
forgetting
that
she
was
a
girl
with
them
i
had
quite
enough
money
i
could
see
to
take
me
home
and
back
on
the
cars
and
by
the
stage
the
stage
repeated
alexia
faintly
yes
you
must
remember
that
this
time
of
which
i
am
telling
you
was
many
many
years
back
besides
in
some
country
places
it
is
still
the
only
mode
of
conveyance
used
polly
pepper
drew
a
long
breath
dear
old
badgertown
and
stage
she
could
see
it
now
as
it
looked
when
the
five
little
peppers
would
run
to
the
windows
of
the
little
brown
house
to
watch
it
go
lumbering
by
and
to
hear
the
old
crack
his
whip
in
greeting
the
housekeeper
had
a
day
off
to
go
to
her
daughter
so
that
helped
my
plan
along
miss
salisbury
was
saying
well
would
it
have
been
for
me
if
the
conditions
had
been
less
easy
but
i
must
hasten
i
have
told
you
that
i
did
not
pause
to
think
that
was
my
trouble
in
those
days
i
acted
on
impulse
often
as
schoolgirls
are
apt
perhaps
to
do
and
so
i
was
not
ready
to
stand
this
sudden
temptation
i
tied
on
my
bonnet
gathered
up
my
little
purse
tightly
in
my
hand
and
although
the
day
was
cold
the
sun
was
shining
brightly
and
my
heart
was
so
full
of
hope
and
anticipation
that
i
scarcely
thought
of
what
i
was
doing
as
i
took
a
thin
little
jacket
instead
of
the
warm
cloak
my
mother
had
made
me
for
winter
wear
i
hurried
out
of
the
house
when
there
was
no
one
to
notice
me
for
the
maids
were
careless
in
the
housekeeper
absence
and
had
slipped
off
for
the
moment
at
any
rate
they
said
afterward
they
never
saw
me
so
off
i
went
i
caught
the
eight
train
just
in
time
which
i
considered
most
fortunate
how
often
afterward
did
i
wish
i
had
missed
it
and
reasoning
within
myself
as
the
wheels
bore
me
away
that
it
was
perfectly
right
to
spend
the
money
to
go
home
for
my
father
had
been
quite
willing
for
me
to
take
the
treat
with
ferguson
and
the
others
i
settled
back
in
my
seat
and
tried
not
to
feel
strange
at
travelling
alone
oh
dear
me
exclaimed
the
girls
huddling
up
closer
to
miss
salisbury
knees
miss
anstice
paced
back
and
forth
it
was
too
late
to
stop
the
story
now
and
her
nervousness
could
only
be
walked
off
but
i
noticed
the
farther
i
got
from
the
boarding
school
little
doubts
would
come
creeping
into
my
mind
first
was
it
very
wise
for
me
to
have
set
out
in
this
way
then
was
it
right
and
suddenly
in
a
flash
it
struck
me
that
i
was
doing
a
very
wrong
thing
and
that
if
my
father
and
my
mother
knew
it
they
would
be
greatly
distressed
and
i
would
have
given
worlds
if
i
had
possessed
them
to
be
back
at
ferguson
studying
my
philosophy
lesson
and
i
laid
my
head
on
the
back
of
the
seat
before
me
and
cried
as
hard
as
i
could
amy
sniffed
into
her
handkerchief
and
two
or
three
other
girls
coughed
as
if
they
had
taken
cold
while
no
one
looked
into
her
neighbor
face
and
a
wild
idea
crossed
my
mind
once
of
rushing
up
to
the
conductor
and
telling
him
of
my
trouble
to
ask
him
if
i
could
get
off
at
the
next
station
and
go
back
but
a
minute
reflection
told
me
that
this
was
foolish
there
was
only
the
late
afternoon
train
to
take
me
to
the
school
i
had
started
and
must
go
on
a
long
sigh
went
through
the
group
miss
anstice
seemed
to
have
it
communicated
to
her
for
she
quickened
her
pace
nervously
at
last
after
what
seemed
an
age
to
me
though
it
was
really
but
half
an
hour
since
we
started
i
made
up
my
mind
to
bear
it
as
well
as
i
could
father
and
mother
would
forgive
me
i
was
sure
and
would
make
ferguson
overlook
it
when
i
glanced
out
of
the
car
window
little
flakes
of
snow
were
falling
fast
it
struck
dismay
to
my
heart
if
it
kept
on
like
this
and
after
watching
it
for
some
moments
i
had
no
reason
to
expect
otherwise
for
it
was
of
that
fine
dry
quality
that
seems
destined
to
last
i
should
not
be
able
to
get
back
to
school
that
afternoon
oh
dear
me
and
now
i
began
to
open
my
heart
to
all
sorts
of
fears
the
train
might
be
delayed
the
stagecoach
slow
in
getting
through
to
cherryfield
by
this
time
i
was
in
a
fine
state
of
nerves
and
did
not
dare
to
think
further
one
of
the
girls
stole
her
hand
softly
up
to
lay
it
on
that
of
the
principal
forgetting
that
she
had
never
before
dared
to
do
such
a
thing
in
all
her
life
miss
salisbury
smiled
and
closed
it
within
her
own
there
was
a
smothered
chorus
of
oh
dears
i
sat
there
my
dears
in
a
misery
that
saw
nothing
of
the
beauty
of
that
storm
knew
nothing
heard
nothing
except
the
occasional
ejaculations
and
remarks
of
the
passengers
such
as
going
to
be
the
worst
storm
of
the
year
and
come
to
stay
suddenly
without
a
bit
of
warning
there
was
a
bumping
noise
then
the
train
dragged
slowly
on
then
stopped
all
the
passengers
jumped
up
except
myself
i
was
too
miserable
to
stir
for
i
knew
now
that
i
was
to
pay
finely
for
my
in
leaving
the
school
without
permission
oh
oh
the
girls
gave
a
little
scream
is
it
what
is
it
the
passengers
one
and
all
cried
and
there
was
great
rushing
to
the
doors
and
hopping
outside
to
ascertain
the
trouble
i
never
knew
for
i
did
care
to
ask
it
was
enough
for
me
that
something
had
broken
and
the
train
had
stopped
to
start
again
no
one
could
tell
when
the
sympathy
and
excitement
now
were
intense
one
girl
sniffed
out
from
behind
her
handkerchief
i
i
should
have
thought
you
would
have
died
miss
salisbury
ah
said
miss
salisbury
with
a
sigh
you
will
find
helen
as
you
grow
older
that
the
only
thing
you
can
do
to
repair
in
any
way
the
mischief
you
have
done
is
to
keep
yourself
well
under
control
and
endure
the
penalty
without
wasting
time
on
your
suffering
so
i
just
made
up
my
mind
now
to
this
and
i
sat
up
straight
determined
not
to
give
way
whatever
happened
it
was
very
hard
when
the
impatient
passengers
would
come
back
into
the
car
to
ask
each
other
soon
do
you
suppose
we
will
get
to
mayville
that
was
where
i
was
to
take
the
stage
till
night
if
we
do
start
one
would
answer
trying
to
be
facetious
but
i
would
torture
myself
into
believing
it
at
last
the
conductor
came
through
and
he
met
a
storm
of
inquiries
all
asking
the
same
question
soon
will
we
get
to
mayville
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
was
perfectly
heartless
in
tone
and
manner
as
he
pulled
out
his
watch
to
consult
it
i
can
never
see
a
big
silver
watch
to
this
day
girls
without
a
shiver
the
salisbury
girls
shivered
in
sympathy
and
tried
to
creep
up
closer
to
her
well
the
conductor
went
on
to
say
that
there
was
no
telling
the
railroad
officials
never
commit
themselves
you
know
they
had
telegraphed
back
to
town
for
another
engine
he
did
mention
that
after
that
we
should
be
sidetracked
to
allow
other
trains
their
right
of
way
and
as
soon
as
they
could
why
they
would
move
then
he
proceeded
to
move
himself
down
the
aisle
in
great
dignity
well
my
dears
you
must
remember
that
this
all
happened
long
years
ago
when
accidents
to
the
trains
were
very
slowly
made
good
we
did
get
into
mayville
until
twelve
if
everything
had
gone
as
it
should
we
ought
to
have
reached
there
three
hours
before
oh
my
goodness
me
exploded
alexia
by
this
time
the
snow
had
piled
up
fast
what
promised
to
be
a
heavy
storm
had
become
a
reality
and
it
was
whirling
and
drifting
dreadfully
you
must
remember
that
i
had
on
my
little
thin
jacket
instead
oh
miss
salisbury
screamed
several
girls
i
forgot
that
do
tell
any
more
sobbed
another
do
miss
salisbury
i
want
you
to
hear
this
story
said
miss
salisbury
quietly
remember
i
did
it
all
myself
and
the
saddest
part
of
it
is
what
i
made
others
suffer
not
my
own
distress
sister
if
you
only
proceed
miss
anstice
abruptly
leaned
over
the
outer
fringe
of
girls
i
am
getting
on
to
the
end
said
miss
salisbury
with
a
smile
well
girls
i
wo
prolong
the
misery
for
you
i
climbed
into
that
stage
it
seemed
to
me
more
dead
than
alive
the
old
showing
as
much
of
his
face
as
his
big
fur
cap
drawn
well
over
his
ears
would
allow
looked
at
me
compassionately
alive
i
can
hear
him
now
your
folks
no
sense
to
let
a
young
thing
come
out
in
that
way
i
was
so
stiff
all
i
could
think
of
was
that
i
had
turned
into
an
icicle
and
that
i
was
liable
to
break
at
any
minute
but
i
could
let
that
criticism
pass
they
did
let
me
i
come
from
school
i
stammered
he
looked
at
me
curiously
got
up
from
his
seat
opened
a
box
under
it
and
twitched
out
a
big
cape
and
otherwise
but
oh
girls
i
never
loved
anything
so
much
in
all
my
life
as
that
horrible
old
article
for
it
saved
my
life
a
breath
went
around
the
circle
you
just
get
into
this
as
soon
as
the
next
one
said
the
gruffly
handing
it
over
to
me
where
i
sat
on
the
middle
seat
i
needed
no
command
but
fairly
huddled
myself
within
it
wrapping
it
around
and
around
me
and
then
i
knew
by
the
time
it
took
to
warm
me
up
how
very
cold
i
had
been
and
every
few
minutes
of
the
toilsome
journey
for
we
had
to
proceed
very
slowly
the
would
look
back
over
his
shoulder
to
say
you
gittin
any
warmer
now
and
i
would
say
thank
you
a
little
and
finally
he
asked
suddenly
your
folks
know
you
comin
and
i
answered
and
i
hoped
he
had
heard
and
i
pulled
the
cape
up
higher
around
my
face
i
was
so
ashamed
but
he
had
heard
for
he
whistled
and
oh
girls
that
made
my
head
sink
lower
yet
oh
my
dears
the
shame
of
is
so
terrible
to
bear
well
after
a
while
we
got
into
cherryfield
along
about
three
oh
dear
exclaimed
the
young
voices
i
could
just
distinguish
our
church
spire
amid
the
whirling
snow
and
then
a
panic
seized
me
i
must
get
down
at
some
spot
where
i
would
not
be
recognized
for
oh
i
did
not
want
any
one
to
tell
that
old
who
i
was
and
thus
bring
discredit
upon
my
father
the
clergyman
for
having
a
daughter
who
had
come
away
from
school
without
permission
so
i
mumbled
out
that
i
was
to
stop
at
the
four
corners
that
was
a
short
distance
from
the
centre
of
the
village
the
usual
stopping
place
one
of
the
passengers
for
i
did
think
it
was
necessary
to
prolong
the
story
to
describe
the
two
women
who
occupied
the
back
seat
leaned
forward
and
said
hope
cheesewell
you
ai
goin
to
let
that
girl
get
out
half
froze
as
she
been
in
this
snowstorm
you
ought
to
go
out
o
your
beat
and
carry
her
home
no
no
i
cried
in
terror
unwinding
myself
from
the
big
cape
and
preparing
to
descend
there
roared
cheesewell
at
me
ye
i
desert
that
child
he
said
to
the
two
women
take
her
home
ef
i
knew
where
in
creation
was
lives
at
the
parsonage
she
th
minister
daughter
said
one
of
the
women
quietly
i
sank
back
in
my
seat
oh
girls
the
bitterness
of
that
moment
and
as
well
as
i
could
for
the
gathering
mist
in
my
eyes
and
the
blinding
storm
without
realized
the
approach
to
my
home
but
what
a
i
managed
to
hand
back
the
big
cape
and
to
thank
cheesewell
then
stumbled
up
the
little
pathway
to
the
parsonage
door
feeling
every
step
a
misery
with
all
those
eyes
watching
me
and
lifting
the
latch
i
was
at
home
then
i
fell
flat
in
the
entry
and
knew
nothing
more
till
i
found
myself
in
my
own
bed
with
my
mother
face
above
me
and
beyond
her
there
was
father
every
girl
was
sobbing
now
no
one
saw
miss
anstice
with
the
tears
raining
down
her
cheeks
at
the
memory
that
the
beautiful
prosperity
of
all
these
later
years
could
not
blot
out
girls
if
my
life
was
saved
in
the
first
place
by
that
old
cape
it
was
saved
again
by
one
person
your
mother
gasped
polly
pepper
with
wet
shining
eyes
no
my
mother
had
gone
to
a
sick
parishioner
and
father
was
with
her
there
was
no
one
but
the
children
at
home
the
bigger
boys
were
away
i
owe
my
life
really
to
my
sister
anstice
begged
miss
anstice
hoarsely
and
trying
to
shrink
away
the
circle
of
girls
whirled
around
to
see
her
clasping
her
slender
hands
tightly
together
while
she
kept
her
face
turned
aside
oh
girls
cried
miss
salisbury
with
sudden
energy
if
you
could
only
understand
what
that
sister
of
mine
did
for
me
i
never
can
tell
you
she
kept
back
her
own
fright
as
the
small
children
were
so
scared
when
they
found
me
lying
there
in
the
entry
for
they
had
all
been
in
the
woodshed
picking
up
some
kindlings
and
did
hear
me
come
in
and
she
thought
at
first
i
was
dead
but
she
worked
over
me
just
as
she
thought
mother
would
you
see
we
had
any
near
neighbors
so
she
could
call
any
one
and
at
last
she
piled
me
all
over
with
blankets
just
where
i
lay
for
she
could
lift
me
of
course
and
tucked
me
in
tightly
and
telling
the
children
not
to
cry
but
to
watch
me
she
ran
a
mile
or
floundered
rather
for
the
snow
was
now
so
deep
to
the
doctor
house
oh
that
was
fine
cried
polly
pepper
with
kindling
eyes
and
turning
her
flushed
face
with
pride
on
miss
anstice
when
miss
salisbury
saw
that
a
happy
smile
spread
over
her
face
and
she
beamed
on
polly
and
then
you
know
the
rest
for
of
course
when
i
came
to
myself
the
doctor
had
patched
me
up
and
once
within
my
father
arms
with
mother
holding
my
hand
why
i
was
forgiven
miss
salisbury
paused
and
glanced
off
over
the
young
heads
not
trusting
herself
to
speak
and
how
did
they
know
at
the
school
where
you
were
fanny
broke
in
impulsively
father
telegraphed
ferguson
and
luckily
for
me
she
and
her
party
were
delayed
by
the
storm
in
returning
to
the
school
so
the
message
was
handed
to
her
as
she
left
the
railroad
station
otherwise
my
absence
would
have
plunged
her
in
terrible
distress
oh
well
it
all
came
out
rightly
after
all
louisa
frink
dropped
her
handkerchief
in
her
lap
and
gave
a
little
laugh
out
rightly
repeated
miss
salisbury
sternly
and
turning
such
a
glance
on
louisa
that
she
wilted
at
once
yes
if
you
can
forget
that
for
days
the
doctor
was
working
to
keep
me
from
brain
fever
that
it
took
much
of
my
father
savings
to
pay
him
that
it
kept
me
from
school
and
lost
me
the
marks
i
had
almost
gained
that
worst
of
all
it
added
lines
of
care
and
distress
to
the
faces
of
my
parents
and
that
my
sister
who
saved
me
barely
escaped
a
long
fit
of
sickness
from
her
exposure
do
sister
do
begged
miss
anstice
out
girls
nothing
can
ever
come
out
rightly
unless
the
steps
leading
up
to
the
end
are
right
kimball
suddenly
appeared
above
the
fringe
of
girls
surrounding
miss
salisbury
there
a
storm
brewin
it
looks
as
if
comin
to
stay
i
all
hitched
up
i
give
ye
my
that
we
better
be
movin
with
that
everybody
hopped
up
for
kimball
was
law
in
such
a
case
the
picnic
party
was
hastily
packed
into
the
barges
polly
carrying
the
little
green
botany
case
with
the
ferns
for
garden
carefully
on
her
lap
and
with
many
backward
glances
for
the
dear
glen
off
they
went
as
fast
as
the
horses
could
swing
along
xv
the
broken
vase
but
drive
as
they
might
kimball
and
his
assistants
they
beat
that
storm
that
was
brewing
it
came
up
rather
slowly
to
be
sure
at
first
but
very
persistently
evidently
the
old
was
right
it
was
coming
to
stay
ye
see
ef
we
had
started
when
we
did
like
enough
we
could
a
got
home
he
vouchsafed
over
his
shoulder
to
miss
salisbury
as
they
rattled
on
dear
me
she
exclaimed
at
thought
of
her
brood
those
young
things
were
having
the
best
of
times
it
was
wildly
exciting
as
clem
forsythe
said
to
be
packed
in
those
on
the
end
seats
huddling
away
from
the
rain
as
much
as
possible
under
cover
of
the
curtains
buttoned
down
fast
and
hilarity
ran
high
they
sang
songs
never
quite
finishing
one
but
running
shrilly
off
to
others
which
were
produced
on
several
different
keys
maybe
according
to
the
mood
of
the
singers
and
as
every
girl
wanted
to
sing
her
favorite
song
there
were
sometimes
various
compositions
being
produced
in
different
quarters
of
the
big
stage
till
no
one
particular
melody
could
be
said
to
have
the
right
of
way
and
miss
salisbury
sat
in
the
midst
of
the
babel
and
smiled
as
much
as
her
anxiety
would
allow
at
the
merriment
and
as
it
was
in
this
stage
so
the
other
stages
were
counterparts
and
the
gay
tunes
and
merry
laughter
floated
back
all
along
the
cavalcade
mingling
harmoniously
with
the
rainfall
suddenly
an
awful
clap
of
thunder
reverberated
in
the
sky
the
songs
ended
in
squeals
of
dismay
and
the
laughter
died
away
oh
oh
we
going
to
have
a
thunder
storm
screamed
more
than
one
girl
huddling
up
closer
to
her
next
neighbor
to
clutch
her
frantically
oh
i
so
afraid
of
the
thunder
screamed
amy
garrett
you
goose
it
wo
hurt
you
lucy
bennett
whom
amy
had
crouched
against
gave
her
a
little
push
it
will
it
will
my
uncle
was
struck
once
said
amy
rebounding
from
the
push
to
grasp
lucy
frantically
around
the
neck
you
nearly
choked
me
to
death
exclaimed
lucy
untwisting
the
nervous
hands
do
get
so
scared
your
uncle
never
was
struck
by
the
thunder
and
we
have
had
any
lightning
yet
so
i
would
yell
till
we
do
well
there
it
is
now
cried
amy
covering
her
eyes
and
there
it
was
now
to
be
sure
in
a
blinding
flash
to
be
followed
by
deeper
rolls
of
thunder
drowning
the
screams
of
the
frightened
girls
and
the
plunging
of
the
horses
that
did
like
it
much
better
kimball
peered
out
and
squinted
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
through
the
blinding
storm
then
he
turned
his
horses
suddenly
off
from
the
road
into
a
narrow
lane
oh
why
do
you
began
miss
salisbury
but
this
remonstrance
would
have
done
any
good
had
the
old
heard
it
at
the
end
of
the
lane
he
knew
in
a
few
moments
they
would
all
arrive
at
a
big
old
fashioned
mansion
where
shelter
could
not
be
refused
them
under
such
circumstances
although
and
kimball
shook
within
himself
at
his
temerity
under
any
other
conditions
visitors
would
not
be
expected
nor
welcomed
for
john
clemcy
and
his
sister
miss
ophelia
had
never
exhibited
since
they
settled
down
in
this
quiet
spot
after
leaving
their
english
home
many
years
ago
any
apparent
desire
to
make
friends
they
were
quite
sufficient
for
themselves
and
what
with
driving
about
which
they
did
in
a
big
basket
phaeton
or
behind
their
solemn
pair
of
black
horses
and
the
still
more
solemn
coachman
isaac
also
black
and
in
the
care
of
the
large
estate
and
the
big
brick
mansion
they
found
ample
occupation
for
their
time
and
thoughts
up
to
this
big
red
brick
mansion
now
plunged
kimball
with
as
much
assurance
as
if
he
were
not
quaking
dreadfully
and
the
other
stages
following
suit
the
sudden
and
unusual
uproar
brought
two
faces
to
the
windows
and
then
to
the
door
may
we
all
git
out
and
go
into
your
barn
roared
kimball
peering
at
them
from
beneath
his
dripping
hat
there
was
an
awful
pause
kimball
clutched
his
old
leather
reins
desperately
and
miss
salisbury
to
whom
had
come
faint
rumors
of
the
chosen
isolation
of
the
brother
and
sister
felt
her
heart
sink
woefully
john
clemcy
stepped
out
slender
tall
with
white
hair
and
beard
both
closely
cropped
he
had
a
pale
aristocratic
face
and
a
pair
of
singularly
stern
eyes
which
he
now
bent
upon
the
old
brother
remonstrated
his
sister
she
looked
as
much
like
him
as
possible
in
face
and
figure
do
not
venture
out
in
this
driving
storm
no
said
clemcy
i
can
not
consent
to
your
going
into
my
stable
i
christian
blurted
out
the
old
to
leave
human
bein
out
in
sech
a
pickle
no
i
am
aware
of
that
said
john
clemcy
without
a
change
of
countenance
and
so
i
invite
you
all
to
come
into
my
house
he
threw
wide
the
door
my
sister
miss
clemcy
miss
ophelia
stepped
forward
and
received
them
as
if
she
had
specially
prepared
for
their
visit
and
with
such
an
air
of
distinction
that
it
completely
overwhelmed
miss
salisbury
so
that
her
own
manners
always
considered
quite
perfect
by
parents
and
friends
of
her
pupils
paled
considerably
in
contrast
it
was
quite
like
entering
an
old
baronial
hall
as
the
courtly
aristocratic
host
ushered
them
in
and
the
girls
not
easily
overawed
by
any
change
of
circumstance
who
had
tumbled
out
laughingly
from
the
stages
despite
miss
salisbury
nervous
endeavors
to
quiet
them
were
now
instantly
subdued
is
it
solemn
whispered
alexia
hanging
to
polly
pepper
her
pale
eyes
roving
over
the
armor
and
old
family
portraits
almost
completely
covering
the
walls
of
the
wide
hall
hush
whispered
polly
back
again
but
i
ca
breathe
oh
look
at
that
old
horror
in
the
ruff
polly
look
she
pinched
the
arm
she
grasped
meantime
although
there
were
so
many
girls
the
big
red
brick
mansion
seemed
quite
able
to
contain
them
hospitably
as
and
miss
clemcy
opened
door
after
door
into
apartments
that
appeared
to
stretch
out
into
greater
space
beyond
when
at
last
the
company
had
been
distributed
miss
salisbury
found
her
voice
i
am
pained
to
think
of
all
the
trouble
we
are
giving
you
miss
clemcy
do
not
mention
it
miss
ophelia
put
up
a
slender
arm
from
which
fell
off
a
deep
flounce
of
rare
old
lace
the
hand
that
thus
came
into
view
was
perfect
and
miss
salisbury
who
could
recognize
qualities
of
distinction
fell
deeply
in
love
with
the
evidences
before
her
do
you
suppose
she
dresses
up
like
that
every
day
silvia
whispered
lucy
bennett
in
an
voice
silvia
in
matters
of
dress
never
being
willing
to
show
surprise
preserved
her
composure
that
nothing
she
managed
to
say
indifferently
it
ca
be
real
such
a
lot
of
it
and
around
her
neck
too
down
into
the
old
colonial
kitchen
with
its
corner
fireplace
wide
and
roomy
and
bricked
to
the
ceiling
clemcy
led
the
way
it
was
a
big
room
and
not
used
for
its
original
purpose
being
filled
with
cabinets
and
shelves
on
which
reposed
some
of
the
most
beautiful
specimens
of
china
and
various
relics
and
curiosities
and
mementos
of
travel
miss
salisbury
thought
she
had
ever
seen
and
she
had
been
about
the
world
a
good
bit
having
utilized
many
of
her
vacations
and
once
or
twice
taking
a
year
off
from
her
school
work
for
that
purpose
and
being
singularly
receptive
to
information
she
was
the
best
of
listeners
in
an
intelligent
way
as
clemcy
moved
about
from
object
to
object
explaining
his
collection
he
seemed
perfectly
absorbed
in
it
and
as
the
girls
began
to
notice
in
his
listener
as
well
lucy
bennett
was
frightfully
romantic
and
jumped
to
conclusions
at
once
oh
do
you
suppose
he
will
marry
her
she
cried
under
her
breath
to
silvia
as
the
two
kept
together
who
what
are
you
talking
about
demanded
silvia
who
was
very
why
that
old
man
whatever
his
name
is
whispered
lucy
clemcy
do
get
names
into
your
head
lu
said
silvia
crossly
who
wanted
to
look
at
things
and
not
be
interrupted
every
minute
i
ca
ever
remember
names
if
i
do
hear
them
said
lucy
so
what
is
the
use
of
my
bothering
to
hear
them
sil
well
do
keep
still
said
silvia
trying
to
twist
away
her
arm
but
lucy
clung
to
it
well
i
ca
keep
still
either
for
i
mortally
afraid
he
is
that
old
man
whatever
you
call
him
going
to
marry
her
who
demanded
silvia
sharply
our
miss
salisbury
and
lu
bennett
silvia
sat
down
in
the
first
chair
she
could
find
it
was
very
fortunate
that
the
other
groups
were
so
absorbed
that
nobody
noticed
them
oh
you
do
say
such
perfectly
silly
things
declared
silvia
smothering
the
peal
of
laughter
that
nearly
escaped
her
well
it
is
silly
cried
lucy
in
an
angry
whisper
and
it
going
to
happen
i
know
and
she
give
up
our
school
to
miss
anstice
and
come
and
live
here
oh
my
she
looked
ready
to
cry
on
the
spot
look
at
them
now
silvia
had
called
lucy
bennett
silly
hundreds
of
times
but
now
as
she
looked
at
clemcy
and
miss
salisbury
she
began
to
have
an
uneasy
feeling
at
her
heart
i
wo
go
to
school
to
miss
anstice
she
declared
passionately
then
she
began
to
plan
immediately
i
get
mother
to
let
me
go
to
boarding
school
and
i
go
with
you
exclaimed
lucy
radiantly
all
this
was
in
stage
whispers
such
a
buzz
going
on
around
them
that
no
one
else
could
possibly
catch
a
word
and
so
in
just
about
two
minutes
they
had
their
immediate
future
all
planned
well
you
better
get
up
out
of
that
chair
said
lucy
presently
and
picking
at
silvia
sleeve
i
guess
i
not
hurting
the
chair
said
silvia
squinting
sideways
at
the
high
carved
back
they
asked
us
in
here
at
least
did
well
he
did
ask
us
to
sit
down
said
lucy
triumphantly
and
if
he
going
to
marry
her
said
silvia
in
a
convincing
whisper
i
guess
i
can
sit
in
all
the
chairs
if
i
want
to
hush
warned
lucy
here
comes
miss
anstice
miss
anstice
with
her
front
breadth
all
stained
with
jelly
cake
and
marmalade
was
wandering
around
quite
subdued
it
was
pitiful
to
see
how
she
always
got
into
the
thickest
of
the
groups
to
hide
her
gown
trying
to
be
sociable
with
the
girls
but
the
girls
not
reciprocating
she
was
at
last
taken
in
tow
by
miss
ophelia
who
set
about
showing
her
some
rare
old
china
as
a
special
attention
now
miss
anstice
cared
nothing
for
rare
old
china
or
indeed
for
relics
or
curiosities
of
any
sort
but
she
was
very
meek
on
this
occasion
and
so
she
allowed
herself
to
be
led
about
from
shelf
to
shelf
and
though
she
said
nothing
miss
ophelia
was
so
enchanted
by
her
own
words
and
memories
as
she
described
in
a
fluent
and
loving
manner
their
various
claims
to
admiration
that
she
thought
the
younger
miss
salisbury
quite
a
remarkable
person
show
her
the
lowestoft
collection
sister
called
john
clemcy
from
across
the
apartment
and
breaking
off
from
his
animated
discussion
over
an
old
egyptian
vase
in
which
miss
salisbury
had
carried
herself
brilliantly
i
will
brother
john
assented
miss
clemcy
with
great
affability
now
here
and
she
opened
the
door
to
its
cabinet
is
what
will
interest
you
greatly
i
think
suddenly
a
crash
as
of
breaking
porcelain
struck
upon
the
ear
every
one
in
the
old
room
jumped
save
the
persons
who
might
be
supposed
to
be
the
most
interested
clemcy
and
his
sister
their
faces
did
not
change
miss
salisbury
deserted
the
egyptian
vase
who
she
demanded
hurrying
to
the
centre
of
the
apartment
a
red
spot
on
either
cheek
has
done
this
john
clemcy
followed
her
do
not
i
beg
he
said
quietly
notice
it
notice
it
after
your
extreme
hospitality
oh
which
one
of
my
scholars
can
have
forgotten
herself
enough
to
touch
a
thing
the
groups
parted
a
little
just
enough
to
disclose
a
shrinking
figure
it
was
lily
whose
curious
fingers
were
clasped
in
distress
she
is
very
young
said
miss
clemcy
softly
as
miss
salisbury
detached
her
from
the
group
and
passed
into
another
room
crying
as
if
her
heart
would
break
john
clemcy
then
came
up
to
his
sister
and
her
visitor
your
sister
must
not
take
it
so
to
heart
he
said
miss
anstice
was
worn
out
by
this
time
what
with
her
gown
and
now
by
this
terrible
thing
that
would
bring
such
discredit
upon
their
school
and
besides
it
might
take
ever
so
much
from
their
savings
to
replace
for
lily
was
poor
and
was
a
connection
so
they
perhaps
would
have
to
help
her
out
she
therefore
could
find
no
words
at
her
command
except
oh
dear
me
and
raised
her
poor
eyes
john
clemcy
searched
her
face
intently
and
actually
smiled
to
reassure
her
she
thought
he
was
looking
at
her
gown
so
she
mumbled
faintly
to
draw
off
his
attention
i
am
afraid
it
was
very
valuable
he
did
tell
her
it
was
one
of
the
oldest
bits
in
his
collection
but
while
miss
clemcy
slipped
off
and
quietly
picked
up
every
piece
of
the
broken
treasure
he
turned
the
conversation
and
talked
rapidly
and
charmingly
upon
something
for
the
life
of
her
miss
anstice
never
could
tell
what
and
he
was
still
talking
when
miss
salisbury
brought
back
lily
by
the
hand
and
still
sniffling
to
stumble
over
her
pleas
for
pardon
and
then
the
storm
having
abated
there
were
instant
preparations
for
departure
set
in
motion
and
kimball
and
his
associates
helped
them
into
their
vehicles
miss
clemcy
beautiful
old
lace
showing
off
finely
on
the
great
porch
as
she
bade
them
it
is
real
i
guess
declared
silvia
looking
closely
from
her
seat
next
to
lucy
and
oh
dear
me
is
this
too
horrible
what
lily
cushing
has
done
john
clemcy
helped
the
ladies
in
miss
anstice
putting
forth
all
her
powers
to
enable
her
to
ascend
the
steep
steps
without
disclosing
the
front
breadth
of
her
gown
despite
her
best
endeavors
she
felt
quite
sure
that
the
keen
eyes
of
both
brother
and
sister
had
discovered
every
blemish
miss
salisbury
sank
back
in
her
seat
as
the
barge
rolled
off
quite
in
despair
for
she
knew
quite
well
that
the
broken
vase
was
one
of
the
gems
of
the
collection
oh
see
the
lovely
rainbow
the
girls
spirits
rose
now
that
they
were
once
more
on
the
move
what
was
one
broken
vase
after
all
and
they
began
to
laugh
and
talk
once
more
oh
dear
polly
pepper
glanced
back
alexia
this
will
just
about
kill
our
dear
miss
salisbury
she
exclaimed
well
i
clear
beat
kimball
was
saying
to
himself
as
nobody
paid
attention
you
might
knock
me
over
with
a
feather
to
think
that
old
that
wo
know
nobody
him
nor
his
sister
an
is
so
hifalutin
smart
out
so
all
of
a
suddint
xvi
new
plans
polly
said
jasper
could
you
come
into
the
den
why
yes
jasper
she
cried
in
surprise
at
his
face
oh
has
anything
happened
no
he
said
but
the
gloomy
look
did
not
disappear
oh
polly
too
bad
to
ask
were
you
going
to
study
with
a
glance
at
her
armful
of
books
no
that
is
i
can
do
them
just
as
well
after
dinner
polly
dropped
her
books
on
the
hall
chair
oh
what
is
it
jasper
running
after
him
into
the
den
it
just
this
polly
i
hate
to
tell
you
he
paused
and
gloom
settled
worse
than
ever
over
his
face
jasper
said
polly
quite
firmly
and
she
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
i
really
think
you
ought
to
tell
me
right
away
what
is
on
your
mind
do
you
really
polly
jasper
asked
eagerly
yes
i
do
said
polly
unless
you
had
rather
tell
mamsie
perhaps
that
would
be
best
jasper
no
i
do
really
think
it
would
in
this
case
polly
i
will
tell
you
so
he
drew
up
a
chair
and
polly
settled
into
it
and
he
perched
on
the
end
of
the
table
you
see
polly
he
began
i
hate
to
tell
you
but
if
i
do
why
of
course
you
ca
in
the
least
understand
how
to
help
no
of
course
i
ca
said
polly
clasping
her
hands
together
tightly
and
trying
to
wait
patiently
for
the
recital
oh
what
could
it
be
well
pickering
is
doing
well
at
school
said
jasper
in
a
burst
it
was
so
much
better
to
have
it
out
at
once
oh
dear
me
exclaimed
polly
in
sorrow
no
he
is
said
jasper
decidedly
it
grows
worse
and
worse
dear
me
said
polly
again
and
now
faber
says
there
is
much
hope
for
him
unless
he
picks
up
in
the
last
half
he
called
me
into
his
study
to
tell
me
that
wants
me
to
influence
him
and
all
that
all
the
hateful
story
was
out
at
last
polly
sprang
out
of
her
chair
you
do
mean
you
ca
mean
that
pickering
will
be
dropped
jasper
she
cried
as
she
faced
him
worse
than
that
answered
jasper
gloomily
worse
than
dropped
exclaimed
polly
with
wide
eyes
to
be
dropped
a
class
would
kill
pick
so
many
boys
have
had
that
happen
although
it
is
quite
bad
enough
i
should
think
so
breathed
polly
but
pick
will
simply
be
shot
out
of
the
school
said
jasper
desperately
there
no
use
in
mincing
matters
faber
has
utterly
lost
patience
and
the
other
teachers
as
well
you
do
mean
that
pickering
dodge
will
be
expelled
cried
polly
in
a
little
scream
yes
jasper
nodded
his
head
unable
to
utter
another
word
then
he
sprang
off
from
the
and
walked
up
and
down
the
room
as
polly
sank
back
in
her
chair
you
see
it
just
this
way
polly
he
cried
pick
has
had
warning
after
warning
you
know
the
teachers
have
a
system
of
sending
written
warnings
around
to
the
boys
when
they
fall
behind
in
their
work
and
he
has
paid
any
attention
to
them
wo
he
pay
attention
to
what
the
teachers
write
to
him
jasper
asked
polly
leaning
forward
in
her
big
chair
to
watch
him
anxiously
as
he
paced
back
and
forth
no
calls
them
rubbish
and
tears
them
up
and
sometimes
he
wo
even
read
them
said
jasper
oh
it
awful
polly
i
should
say
it
was
said
polly
slowly
very
awful
indeed
jasper
and
the
last
time
he
had
one
from
herr
frincke
about
his
german
pick
brought
it
into
the
room
where
a
lot
of
us
boys
were
and
read
it
out
with
no
end
of
fun
over
it
and
it
went
into
the
and
he
has
tackled
his
grammar
a
bit
better
since
only
the
translations
he
up
a
trifle
on
oh
now
i
know
why
you
would
go
to
ride
with
me
for
the
last
week
cried
polly
springing
out
of
her
chair
to
rush
up
to
him
you
been
helping
pickering
she
declared
with
kindling
eyes
never
mind
said
jasper
uneasily
and
it
was
splendid
of
you
cried
polly
the
color
flying
over
her
cheeks
oh
jasper
i
do
believe
you
can
pull
him
through
no
i
ca
polly
jasper
stood
quite
still
no
one
can
pull
him
through
but
you
polly
i
exclaimed
polly
in
amazement
why
jasper
king
and
she
tumbled
back
a
few
steps
to
stare
at
him
what
you
mean
it
just
this
way
jasper
threw
back
his
hair
from
his
hot
forehead
pick
does
care
a
bit
for
what
i
say
it
an
old
story
goes
in
at
one
ear
and
out
at
the
other
oh
he
does
care
for
what
you
say
contradicted
polly
stoutly
ever
and
ever
so
much
jasper
well
he
heard
it
so
much
perhaps
i
pounded
at
him
too
hard
and
then
again
jasper
paused
turned
away
a
bit
and
rushed
back
hastily
with
vexation
written
all
over
his
face
i
must
speak
it
i
ca
help
him
any
more
for
somehow
faber
has
found
it
out
and
forbids
it
that
one
reason
of
the
talk
this
morning
in
his
study
says
i
must
influence
him
and
all
that
that
rubbish
i
ca
influence
him
jasper
dashed
over
to
lay
his
head
on
the
table
on
his
folded
arms
polly
if
pick
is
expelled
i
he
could
finish
it
his
voice
breaking
all
up
polly
ran
over
to
lay
a
hand
on
his
shaking
shoulders
what
can
i
do
jasper
she
cried
brokenly
tell
me
and
i
do
it
every
single
thing
you
must
talk
to
him
said
jasper
raising
his
head
it
filled
polly
with
dismay
to
see
his
face
get
him
in
here
i
bring
him
over
and
then
clear
out
of
the
den
oh
jasper
exclaimed
polly
quite
aghast
i
could
talk
to
pickering
dodge
why
he
would
listen
to
me
yes
he
would
declared
jasper
eagerly
he
thinks
everything
of
you
polly
and
if
you
say
the
word
it
will
do
more
good
than
anything
else
do
polly
he
begged
but
jasper
began
polly
a
little
white
line
coming
around
her
mouth
what
would
he
think
to
have
me
talk
to
him
about
his
lessons
think
repeated
jasper
why
he
like
it
polly
and
it
will
be
the
very
thing
that
will
help
him
oh
i
ca
cried
polly
twisting
her
fingers
then
she
broke
out
passionately
oh
he
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
himself
not
to
study
and
there
that
nice
cabot
and
his
aunt
aunt
exclaimed
jasper
explosively
polly
i
do
believe
if
he
her
picking
at
him
all
the
time
he
would
try
harder
well
his
uncle
is
different
said
polly
her
indignation
by
no
means
dying
out
yes
but
it
his
aunt
who
makes
the
mischief
honestly
polly
i
believe
i
could
stand
her
said
jasper
in
a
loyal
burst
no
i
do
believe
i
could
either
confessed
polly
and
you
see
when
a
boy
has
such
a
home
no
matter
what
they
give
him
why
he
does
have
the
ambition
that
he
would
if
things
were
different
just
think
polly
not
to
have
one
own
father
or
mother
oh
jasper
cried
polly
quite
overcome
i
do
it
i
will
polly
jasper
seized
her
hands
and
held
them
fast
his
dark
eyes
glowing
oh
polly
that
so
awfully
good
of
you
and
you
better
run
right
over
and
get
him
now
said
polly
speaking
very
fast
or
i
may
run
away
i
shall
get
so
scared
you
wo
run
away
i
be
bound
cried
jasper
bursting
into
a
merry
laugh
and
rushing
off
with
a
light
heart
and
presently
in
less
time
than
one
could
imagine
though
to
polly
it
seemed
an
age
back
he
came
pickering
with
him
all
alive
with
curiosity
to
know
what
polly
pepper
wanted
of
him
it
about
the
play
i
suppose
he
began
lolling
into
an
jasper
would
tell
me
what
it
all
about
only
seized
me
by
the
ear
and
told
me
to
come
on
draw
up
your
chair
jasper
and
why
hullo
where
is
the
chap
swinging
his
long
figure
around
to
stare
pickering
began
polly
and
the
den
usually
the
pleasantest
place
in
all
the
house
was
now
like
a
prison
whose
walls
would
let
her
breathe
i
do
know
what
to
say
oh
dear
me
poor
polly
could
get
no
further
but
sat
there
in
hopeless
misery
looking
at
him
eh
what
oh
beg
pardon
exclaimed
pickering
whirling
back
in
his
chair
but
things
are
so
very
queer
first
jasper
rushes
off
like
a
lunatic
and
i
am
worse
said
polly
at
last
finding
her
tongue
i
wonder
you
think
it
queer
pickering
but
jasper
does
so
love
you
and
it
will
just
kill
him
if
you
do
study
it
was
all
out
now
and
in
the
most
dreadful
way
and
feeling
that
she
had
quite
destroyed
all
hope
polly
sat
up
pale
and
stiff
in
her
chair
pickering
threw
his
long
figure
out
of
the
rushed
up
and
down
the
den
with
immense
strides
and
came
back
to
stand
directly
in
front
of
her
do
you
mean
it
polly
his
long
face
was
working
badly
and
his
hands
were
clenched
but
as
they
were
thrust
deep
within
his
pockets
polly
could
see
them
yes
said
polly
i
do
pickering
he
stalked
off
again
but
was
back
once
more
polly
wondering
how
she
could
possibly
bear
to
tell
jasper
of
her
failure
for
of
course
pickering
was
very
angry
when
he
said
polly
i
want
to
tell
you
something
what
is
it
polly
looked
at
him
sharply
and
caught
her
breath
i
wo
drag
jasper
down
i
tell
you
with
me
i
get
through
somehow
at
school
i
promise
you
that
here
he
twitched
out
his
right
hand
from
its
pocket
and
thrust
it
out
at
her
oh
pickering
dodge
exclaimed
polly
in
a
transport
and
seizing
his
hand
it
was
shaken
vigorously
there
that
a
bargain
declared
pickering
solemnly
i
get
through
someway
and
say
polly
it
was
awfully
good
of
you
to
speak
it
was
awfully
hard
said
polly
drawing
a
long
breath
oh
are
you
sure
you
are
not
vexed
pickering
very
sure
and
polly
face
drooped
anxiously
vexed
cried
pickering
i
should
rather
say
not
polly
i
lazy
and
selfish
and
good
for
nothing
but
i
could
be
vexed
for
was
awfully
hard
for
you
to
do
i
guess
it
was
said
polly
then
she
gave
a
little
laugh
for
it
was
all
bright
and
jolly
again
and
she
knew
that
pickering
would
keep
his
word
and
that
evening
after
jasper
and
she
had
a
dance
they
were
so
happy
they
could
keep
still
in
the
wide
hall
jasper
burst
out
suddenly
with
a
fresh
idea
polly
he
said
drawing
her
off
to
rest
on
one
of
the
high
carved
chairs
there
one
more
thing
oh
what
is
it
jasper
she
cried
gaily
with
flushed
cheeks
oh
was
that
spin
just
delicious
was
it
cried
jasper
heartily
well
now
polly
flinging
himself
down
on
the
next
chair
it
just
this
do
you
know
i
do
believe
we
ought
to
have
our
play
not
have
our
play
polly
peered
around
to
look
closely
into
his
face
what
do
you
mean
jasper
you
see
polly
pick
was
to
take
a
prominent
part
and
he
ought
not
to
you
know
it
will
take
him
from
his
lessons
to
rehearse
and
all
that
and
he
so
backward
there
a
whole
lot
for
him
to
make
up
well
but
pickering
will
have
to
give
up
his
part
then
said
polly
decidedly
for
we
simply
got
to
have
that
play
to
get
the
money
to
help
that
poor
brakeman
family
jasper
winced
i
know
we
must
earn
it
somehow
he
said
we
must
earn
it
by
the
play
said
polly
and
besides
jasper
we
voted
at
the
club
meeting
to
have
it
so
there
now
she
brought
up
triumphantly
we
could
vote
to
rescind
that
vote
said
jasper
well
we
do
want
to
why
jasper
how
that
would
look
on
our
two
record
books
said
polly
in
surprise
for
jasper
was
so
proud
of
his
club
and
its
records
yes
of
course
as
our
two
clubs
united
that
evening
it
must
go
down
in
both
books
said
jasper
slowly
yes
of
course
assented
polly
happily
well
now
you
see
jasper
that
we
really
give
it
up
for
we
gone
too
far
pickering
will
have
to
let
some
one
else
take
the
part
of
the
chief
brigand
for
the
little
play
was
almost
all
written
by
polly
fingers
jasper
filling
out
certain
parts
when
implored
to
give
advice
and
brigands
and
highway
robberies
and
buried
treasures
and
rescued
maidens
and
gallant
knights
figured
generously
in
a
style
to
give
immense
satisfaction
and
the
play
is
so
very
splendid
cried
jasper
oh
dear
me
what
ought
we
to
do
polly
he
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
a
moment
pickering
must
give
up
his
part
said
polly
again
but
polly
you
know
he
has
been
in
all
our
plays
said
jasper
and
he
feel
so
badly
and
now
he
got
all
this
trouble
about
his
lessons
on
his
mind
and
jasper
face
fell
polly
twisted
uncomfortably
on
her
chair
oh
dear
me
she
began
i
suppose
we
must
give
it
up
and
if
we
gave
it
up
not
altogether
but
put
it
off
till
he
catches
up
on
his
studies
suggested
jasper
why
he
would
be
dropped
out
but
the
poor
brakeman
family
jasper
said
polly
puzzled
that
jasper
should
forget
the
object
of
the
play
oh
i
did
mean
that
we
should
put
off
earning
the
money
polly
cried
jasper
quite
horrified
at
such
a
thought
we
must
do
something
else
so
that
we
can
sell
just
as
many
tickets
but
what
will
it
be
asked
polly
trying
not
to
feel
crushed
and
sighing
at
the
disappearance
of
the
beautiful
play
for
a
time
at
least
well
we
could
have
recitations
for
one
thing
said
jasper
feeling
dreadfully
to
see
polly
disappointment
and
concealing
his
own
for
he
had
set
his
heart
on
the
play
too
oh
dear
me
exclaimed
polly
wrinkling
up
her
face
in
disdain
jasper
do
you
know
i
am
so
tired
of
recitations
so
am
i
jasper
bobbed
his
head
in
sympathy
but
we
boys
have
some
new
ones
learned
for
last
exhibition
so
pick
wo
have
to
take
a
moment
from
his
lessons
and
then
we
can
have
music
and
you
will
play
polly
oh
jasper
i
played
so
much
said
polly
they
all
tired
of
hearing
me
they
never
would
be
tired
of
hearing
you
polly
said
jasper
simply
every
one
of
us
thinks
you
play
beautifully
and
tableaux
and
an
operetta
take
just
as
much
time
to
rehearse
mused
polly
thinking
very
hard
if
there
was
something
to
keep
them
from
the
dreaded
recitations
and
i
just
loathe
an
operetta
or
tableaux
exclaimed
jasper
with
such
venom
that
polly
burst
out
laughing
oh
jasper
if
you
could
see
your
face
she
cried
i
should
want
to
he
laughed
too
but
of
all
insipid
things
an
operetta
is
the
worst
and
tableaux
the
way
miss
montague
drilled
and
drilled
drilled
us
and
then
stuck
us
up
like
sticks
not
to
move
for
a
or
so
nearly
finished
me
so
it
did
me
confessed
polly
and
besides
it
would
take
a
great
deal
more
time
to
go
through
all
that
drilling
than
to
rehearse
the
play
of
course
it
would
said
jasper
so
tableaux
thank
fortune
are
not
to
be
thought
of
i
think
it
will
have
to
be
recitations
and
music
polly
i
suppose
so
she
said
with
a
sigh
oh
jasper
then
she
sprang
off
from
her
chair
and
clapped
her
hands
i
thought
of
the
very
thing
i
believe
hamilton
dyce
would
tell
some
of
his
funny
stories
and
help
out
the
program
capital
shouted
jasper
and
just
at
this
moment
the
big
front
door
opened
and
the
butler
ushered
in
miss
mary
taylor
and
dyce
polly
and
jasper
rushed
up
to
the
visitors
for
they
were
prime
favorites
with
the
young
people
and
precipitated
upon
them
all
their
woes
the
end
was
that
they
both
promised
beautifully
to
do
whatever
was
wanted
for
miss
mary
taylor
sang
delightfully
and
pickering
is
safe
polly
for
i
know
now
he
go
through
the
last
half
cried
jasper
as
they
ran
off
to
study
their
lessons
for
the
next
day
xvii
phronsie
and
after
that
there
was
no
more
trouble
about
that
program
for
as
luck
would
have
it
the
very
next
day
a
letter
came
from
joel
saying
that
marks
had
given
them
a
holiday
of
a
week
on
account
of
the
illness
of
two
boys
in
their
dormitory
and
may
i
bring
home
tom
beresford
he
fine
and
please
mamsie
let
me
fetch
sinbad
do
telegraph
and
mother
fisher
after
consultation
with
king
telegraphed
yes
and
wild
was
the
rejoicing
over
the
return
of
joel
and
david
and
percy
and
van
and
tom
for
mother
fisher
was
ready
to
receive
with
open
arms
and
very
glad
silently
to
watch
one
of
joel
friends
and
to
think
that
sinbad
is
coming
cried
polly
dancing
about
just
think
phronsie
joel
dear
dog
that
marks
let
him
take
to
the
little
cobbler
to
keep
for
him
and
she
took
phronsie
hand
and
they
spun
around
the
hall
i
shall
get
him
a
new
pink
ribbon
declared
phronsie
breathlessly
when
the
spin
was
over
do
cried
polly
dear
me
that
was
a
good
spin
phronsie
i
should
think
it
was
said
ben
goodness
me
polly
phronsie
and
you
made
such
a
breeze
did
we
pet
cried
polly
with
a
last
kiss
oh
ben
and
jasper
to
think
those
boys
will
be
here
for
our
entertainment
i
know
tom
is
made
of
the
right
stuff
mamsie
said
proudly
to
father
fisher
else
my
boy
would
not
choose
him
that
a
fact
wife
the
little
doctor
responded
heartily
joel
is
all
right
may
be
a
bit
heedless
but
he
has
a
good
head
on
his
shoulders
the
five
boys
bounded
into
the
wide
hall
that
evening
joel
first
and
in
his
arms
a
yellow
dog
by
no
means
handsome
with
small
beady
eyes
and
a
stubby
tail
that
he
was
violently
endeavoring
to
wag
under
the
impression
that
he
had
a
good
deal
of
it

shouted
joel
his
black
eyes
glowing
and
precipitating
himself
into
her
arms

and
all
see
sinbad

mamsie
it
impossible
not
to
see
him
said
ben
goodness
me
joe
what
a
dog
which
luckily
joel
did
not
hear
for
the
babel
going
on
around
besides
there
was
phronsie
trying
to
put
her
arms
around
the
dog
and
telling
him
about
the
pink
ribbon
which
she
held
in
her
hand
joe
said
fisher
who
had
been
here
there
and
everywhere
in
the
group
and
coming
up
to
nip
joel
jacket
introduce
your
friend
you
a
pretty
one
to
bring
a
boy
home
and
i
forgot
you
tom
shouted
joel
starting
off
still
hanging
to
his
dog
oh
there
you
are
seeing
tom
in
the
midst
of
the
circle
and
talking
away
to
grandpapa
and
polly
as
if
i
could
introduce
tom
sniffed
percy
importantly
quite
delighted
at
joel
social
omissions
i
done
it
ages
ago
all
right
said
joel
quite
relieved
oh
phronsie
sinbad
want
that
ribbon
on
as
phronsie
was
making
violent
efforts
to
get
it
around
the
dog
neck
i
would
let
her
joel
said
mother
fisher
if
i
were
you
but
he
hates
a
ribbon
said
joel
in
disgust
and
besides
he
chew
it
up
phronsie
i
do
want
him
to
chew
it
up
joel
said
phronsie
slowly
and
pausing
in
her
endeavors
and
she
looked
very
sober
i
tell
you
phronsie
fisher
took
the
pink
satin
ribbon
that
phronsie
had
bought
with
her
own
money
now
do
you
want
mother
to
tie
it
on
do
mamsie
begged
phronsie
smoothing
her
gown
in
great
satisfaction
and
presently
there
was
a
nice
little
bow
standing
up
on
the
back
of
sinbad
neck
and
as
there
did
seem
to
be
any
ends
to
speak
of
there
was
nothing
to
distract
his
attention
from
the
responsibility
of
watching
all
the
people
oh
is
he
cried
phronsie
in
a
transport
and
hopping
up
and
down
to
clap
her
hands
grandpapa
dear
do
look
and
i
told
princey
all
about
him
and
given
him
a
ribbon
too
so
he
wo
feel
badly
and
after
this
excitement
had
died
down
joel
whirled
around
brought
his
banjo
he
announced
oh
exclaimed
polly
and
he
can
sing
cried
joel
thinking
it
best
to
mention
all
the
accomplishments
at
once
do
joe
begged
tom
twitching
his
sleeve
polly
looked
over
at
jasper
with
sparkling
eyes
and
the
color
flew
into
her
cheeks
splendid
his
eyes
signalled
back
what
is
it
cried
joel
giving
each
a
sharp
glance
now
you
two
have
secrets
and
that
mean
when
we
just
got
home
what
is
it
polly
he
ran
to
her
shaking
her
arm
you
see
in
time
said
polly
shaking
him
off
to
dance
away
i
do
want
to
know
in
time
said
joel
i
want
to
know
now
mamsie
what
is
it
i
sure
i
have
the
least
idea
said
mother
fisher
who
heard
joel
announcement
and
i
think
you
would
do
better
joey
to
take
care
of
your
guest
and
let
other
things
wait
oh
tom
does
want
to
be
fussed
over
said
joel
carelessly
yet
he
went
back
to
the
tall
boy
standing
quite
still
in
the
midst
of
the
general
hilarity
that
just
the
way
ben
and
polly
used
to
do
in
the
little
brown
house
he
grumbled
always
running
away
and
hiding
their
old
secrets
from
me
tom
well
we
had
to
if
we
ever
told
each
other
anything
said
ben
coolly
joel
everlastingly
tagged
us
about
beresford
well
i
had
to
if
i
ever
heard
anything
burst
out
joel
with
a
laugh
come
on
tom
and
he
bore
him
off
together
with
sinbad
polly
jasper
was
saying
the
two
now
being
off
in
a
corner
how
fine
now
perhaps
tom
beresford
will
sing
and
play
finished
polly
with
kindling
face
oh
jasper
was
anything
ever
so
gorgeous
she
cried
joyfully
for
polly
dearly
loved
words
and
we
sell
a
lot
more
tickets
because
new
and
people
will
want
to
hear
him
if
he
will
do
it
said
jasper
slowly
not
wanting
to
dampen
her
anticipation
but
dreadfully
afraid
that
the
new
boy
might
not
respond
oh
he
do
it
i
do
believe
declared
polly
confidently
he
must
jasper
help
about
that
poor
brakeman
family
and
he
did
tom
beresford
evidently
made
up
his
mind
when
he
went
home
with
joel
to
do
everything
straight
through
that
the
family
asked
him
for
he
turned
out
to
be
the
best
visitor
they
had
entertained
and
one
and
all
pronounced
him
capital
all
but
joel
himself
who
told
him
very
flatly
the
second
day
that
he
was
half
as
nice
as
at
school
for
he
was
now
running
at
everybody
beck
and
nod
instead
of
yours
said
tom
calmly
then
he
roared
hush
up
cried
joel
very
uncomfortable
and
getting
very
red
well
you
must
acknowledge
tom
that
i
want
to
see
something
of
you
else
why
would
i
have
brought
you
home
pray
tell
nevertheless
i
shall
do
what
your
sister
polly
and
your
mother
and
jasper
and
king
ask
me
to
do
said
tom
composedly
which
was
all
joel
got
for
his
fuming
and
the
most
that
he
saw
of
tom
after
that
was
a
series
of
dissolving
views
for
even
phronsie
began
to
monopolize
him
being
very
much
taken
with
his
obliging
ways
at
last
joel
took
to
moping
and
ben
found
him
thus
in
a
corner
see
here
old
fellow
that
a
nice
way
to
come
home
on
a
holiday
and
have
such
a
face
i
do
wonder
you
want
to
sneak
in
here
it
pretty
hard
said
joel
trying
not
to
sniffle
to
have
a
fellow
you
bring
home
from
school
turn
his
back
on
you
well
he
could
turn
his
back
on
you
said
ben
wanting
very
much
to
laugh
but
he
restrained
himself
if
you
went
with
him
i
ca
follow
him
about
said
joel
in
a
loud
tone
of
disgust
twanging
his
old
banjo
all
the
time
and
polly
got
him
to
sing
and
he
practising
up
i
wish
was
smashed
what
said
ben
only
half
comprehending
why
his
old
banjo
i
did
think
he
play
it
all
the
time
said
joel
who
was
secretly
very
proud
of
his
friend
accomplishments
and
he
displayed
a
very
injured
countenance
see
here
now
joe
said
ben
laying
a
very
decided
hand
on
jacket
do
you
just
drop
all
this
and
come
out
of
your
hole
you
ashamed
joe
run
along
and
find
beresford
and
pitch
into
whatever
he
doing
i
ca
do
anything
for
that
old
concert
said
joel
who
obeyed
enough
to
come
out
of
the
old
hole
but
stood
glancing
at
ben
with
sharp
black
eyes
i
do
know
about
that
said
ben
you
can
at
least
help
to
get
the
tickets
ready
did
polly
say
so
demanded
joel
all
in
a
glow
say
ben
did
she
advancing
on
him
no
but
i
do
for
polly
asked
me
to
do
them
and
you
know
joe
how
busy
i
am
all
day
he
did
say
how
tired
also
but
joel
knew
how
ben
was
working
at
cabot
and
van
meter
hoping
to
get
into
business
life
the
sooner
to
begin
to
pay
grandpapa
back
for
all
his
kindness
ben
if
i
can
help
you
with
those
tickets
i
do
it
every
trace
of
joel
grumpiness
had
flown
to
the
four
winds
let
me
will
you
he
begged
eagerly
all
right
ben
had
no
need
to
haul
him
along
as
joel
raced
on
ahead
up
to
ben
room
to
get
the
paraphernalia
i
ca
think
what
become
of
joel
said
polly
flying
down
the
long
hall
in
great
perplexity
we
want
him
dreadfully
have
you
seen
him
phronsie
no
said
phronsie
i
have
polly
and
a
look
of
distress
came
into
her
face
never
mind
pet
said
polly
her
brow
clearing
i
find
him
soon
but
phronsie
watched
polly
fly
off
with
a
troubled
face
then
she
said
to
herself
i
ought
to
find
joey
for
polly
and
started
on
a
tour
of
investigation
to
suit
herself
meanwhile
ben
was
giving
joel
instructions
about
the
tickets
and
joel
presently
was
so
absorbed
he
would
have
cared
if
all
the
tom
beresfords
in
the
world
had
deserted
him
as
he
bent
over
his
task
quite
elated
that
he
was
helping
polly
and
becoming
one
of
the
assistants
to
make
the
affair
a
success
i
guess
it
going
to
be
a
great
thing
ben
he
said
looking
up
a
moment
from
the
pink
and
yellow
pasteboard
out
of
which
he
was
cutting
the
tickets
you
better
believe
so
nodded
ben
hugely
delighted
to
see
joe
good
spirits
when
the
door
opened
and
in
popped
phronsie
yellow
head
she
ran
up
to
joel
oh
joey
she
hummed
delightedly
i
found
you
and
threw
herself
into
his
arms
joel
turned
sharply
knife
in
hand
it
was
all
done
in
an
instant
phronsie
exclaimed
in
such
a
tone
that
ben
off
in
the
corner
of
the
room
whirled
around
to
see
joel
white
as
a
sheet
holding
phronsie
i
killed
her
he
screamed
ben
sprang
to
them
the
knife
lay
on
the
table
where
joel
had
thrown
it
a
little
red
tinge
along
the
tip
ben
could
help
seeing
it
as
he
dashed
by
with
a
groan
give
her
to
me
he
commanded
hoarsely
no
no
i
hold
her
persisted
joel
through
white
lips
and
hanging
to
phronsie
give
her
to
me
and
run
down
for
father
fisher
it
does
hurt
much
joey
said
phronsie
holding
up
her
little
arm
a
small
stream
of
blood
was
flowing
down
and
she
turned
away
her
head
joel
took
one
look
and
fled
with
wild
eyes
i
do
believe
it
very
bad
ben
made
himself
call
after
him
hoarsely
now
phronsie
sit
in
my
lap
there
and
i
keep
this
old
cut
together
as
well
as
i
can
we
must
hold
your
arm
up
so
child
ben
made
himself
talk
as
fast
as
he
could
to
keep
phronsie
eyes
on
him
i
got
cut
in
the
little
brown
house
once
did
i
bensie
said
phronsie
and
trying
to
creep
up
further
into
ben
lap
you
must
sit
straight
child
said
ben
oh
would
father
fisher
and
mamsie
ever
come
for
the
blood
despite
all
his
efforts
was
running
down
the
little
arm
pretty
fast
why
ben
asked
phronsie
with
wide
eyes
and
wishing
that
her
arm
would
ache
so
for
now
quite
a
smart
pain
had
set
in
why
bensie
and
thinking
if
she
could
be
cuddled
it
would
be
quite
so
bad
why
we
must
hold
your
arm
up
stiff
said
ben
just
as
mamsie
came
up
to
her
baby
and
took
her
in
her
arms
and
then
phronsie
did
care
whether
the
ache
was
there
or
not
joe
could
help
it
said
ben
brokenly
i
believe
that
mother
fisher
said
firmly
oh
ben
the
doctor
is
away
ben
started
i
go
down
to
the
office
perhaps
he
there
no
there
no
chance
i
sent
for
pennell
your
father
likes
him
now
phronsie
fisher
set
her
white
lips
together
tightly
you
and
i
and
ben
will
see
to
this
arm
of
yours
ben
get
one
of
your
big
handkerchiefs
it
does
ache
so
much
mamsie
said
phronsie
only
i
would
like
to
lay
it
down
and
that
is
just
what
we
ca
do
phronsie
said
mother
fisher
decidedly
all
right
to
ben
now
tear
it
into
strips
old
king
was
not
in
the
library
when
joel
had
rushed
down
with
his
dreadful
news
but
was
in
jasper
den
consulting
with
him
and
polly
about
the
program
for
the
entertainment
as
polly
and
jasper
much
to
the
old
gentleman
delight
never
took
a
step
without
going
to
him
for
advice
the
consequence
was
that
these
three
did
not
hear
of
the
accident
till
a
little
later
when
the
two
whitney
boys
dashed
in
with
pale
faces
phronsie
hurt
was
their
announcement
which
have
been
given
so
abruptly
had
not
each
one
been
so
anxious
to
get
ahead
of
the
other
old
king
not
comprehending
had
turned
sharply
in
his
chair
to
stare
at
them
hush
boys
warned
polly
hoarsely
pointing
to
him
is
mamsie
with
her
she
did
dare
to
speak
phronsie
name
yes
said
van
eager
to
communicate
all
the
news
and
hoping
percy
would
not
cut
in
but
percy
after
polly
warning
had
stood
quite
still
afraid
to
open
his
mouth
jasper
was
hunting
in
one
of
his
drawers
for
an
old
book
his
father
had
wished
to
see
so
of
course
he
had
heard
a
word
here
it
is
father
he
cried
rushing
back
and
whirling
the
leaves
why
what
for
he
saw
polly
face
oh
jasper
do
said
polly
brokenly
why
do
you
boys
rush
in
in
this
manner
demanded
old
king
testily
and
polly
child
what
is
the
matter
grandpapa
cried
polly
rushing
over
to
him
to
put
her
arms
around
his
neck
phronsie
is
hurt
someway
i
do
believe
it
is
much
she
gasped
while
jasper
ran
to
his
other
side
phronsie
hurt
cried
old
king
in
sharp
distress
where
is
she
then
percy
seeing
it
was
considered
time
for
communication
of
news
struck
in
boldly
and
between
the
two
all
that
was
known
of
joel
wild
exclamations
was
put
before
them
all
this
was
told
along
the
hall
and
going
over
the
stairs
for
grandpapa
holding
polly
hand
with
jasper
hurrying
fast
behind
them
was
making
good
time
up
to
ben
room
and
fisher
ca
be
found
shouted
van
afraid
that
the
whole
would
not
be
told
polly
gave
a
shiver
that
all
her
could
not
help
but
joel
gone
for
pennell
screamed
percy
fisher
sent
him
he
very
good
said
jasper
comfortingly
so
this
is
the
way
they
came
into
ben
room
oh
here
grandpapa
cooed
phronsie
trying
to
get
down
from
lap
oh
no
phronsie
said
fisher
you
must
sit
still
it
better
for
your
arm
but
grandpapa
looks
sick
said
phronsie
bless
me
oh
you
poor
lamb
you
old
king
went
unsteadily
across
the
room
and
knelt
down
by
her
side
grandpapa
said
phronsie
stroking
his
white
face
see
it
all
tied
up
high
sit
still
phronsie
said
fisher
keeping
her
fingers
on
the
cut
would
the
doctor
ever
come
besides
joel
thomas
and
several
more
messengers
were
despatched
with
orders
for
pennell
and
to
find
fisher
with
the
names
of
other
doctors
if
these
failed
god
would
send
some
one
of
them
soon
she
knew
phronsie
obediently
sat
quite
still
although
she
longed
to
show
grandpapa
the
white
bandages
drawn
tightly
around
her
arm
and
she
smoothed
his
hair
while
he
clasped
his
hands
in
her
lap
i
want
polly
she
said
presently
stay
where
you
are
polly
said
her
mother
who
had
telegraphed
this
before
with
her
eyes
over
phronsie
yellow
hair
polly
at
the
sound
of
phronsie
voice
had
leaned
forward
but
now
stood
quite
still
clasping
her
hands
tightly
together
speak
to
her
polly
said
jasper
but
polly
shook
her
head
unable
to
utter
a
sound
polly
you
must
said
jasper
for
phronsie
was
trying
to
turn
in
her
mother
lap
and
saying
in
a
worried
way
where
polly
i
want
polly
polly
is
over
there
said
mamsie
but
i
do
not
think
it
best
for
her
to
come
now
but
she
speak
to
you
phronsie
how
funny
laughed
phronsie
polly
ca
come
but
she
talk
across
the
room
everything
turned
black
before
polly
eyes
but
she
began
yes
pet
i
here
very
bravely
i
am
so
glad
you
are
there
polly
said
phronsie
easily
satisfied
footsteps
rapid
and
light
were
heard
on
the
stairs
polly
and
jasper
flew
away
from
the
doorway
to
let
pennell
his
little
case
in
his
hand
come
in
well
well
he
exclaimed
cheerily
so
now
it
phronsie
i
coming
to
her
this
time
for
he
had
often
dropped
in
to
call
or
to
dine
since
the
railway
accident
yes
said
phronsie
with
a
little
laugh
of
delight
for
she
very
much
liked
pennell
he
always
took
her
on
his
lap
and
told
her
stories
and
he
had
a
way
of
tucking
certain
little
articles
in
his
pockets
to
have
her
hunt
for
them
so
they
had
gotten
on
amazingly
well
why
where
phronsie
began
in
a
puzzled
way
is
dr
fisher
pennell
finished
it
for
her
rapidly
going
on
with
his
work
well
he
be
here
soon
i
think
and
you
know
he
always
likes
me
to
do
things
when
he
is
on
hand
so
i
come
and
i
like
you
very
much
said
phronsie
wriggling
her
toes
in
satisfaction
i
know
that
we
are
famous
friends
phronsie
said
the
doctor
with
one
of
those
pleasant
smiles
of
his
that
showed
his
white
teeth
what
famous
asked
phronsie
keeping
her
grave
eyes
on
his
face
oh
fine
it
means
we
are
fine
friends
are
we
phronsie
yes
we
are
declared
phronsie
bending
forward
to
see
his
work
the
better
and
taking
her
eyes
from
his
face
there
there
you
must
sit
quite
straight
that
a
nice
child
phronsie
and
see
here
i
must
take
you
sometime
in
my
carriage
when
i
go
on
my
calls
will
you
go
phronsie
and
pennell
smiled
again
yes
i
will
phronsie
nodded
her
yellow
head
while
she
fastened
her
eyes
on
his
face
i
used
to
go
with
papa
fisher
when
i
was
at
the
little
brown
house
and
i
liked
it
i
did
well
and
now
you
will
go
with
me
laughed
pennell
now
phronsie
i
think
you
are
fixed
up
quite
nicely
slipping
the
various
articles
he
had
used
deftly
into
his
little
bag
and
snapping
it
to
not
a
very
bad
affair
he
said
whirling
around
to
old
king
drawn
deeply
within
a
big
chair
having
already
telegraphed
the
same
to
mother
fisher
over
phronsie
head
thank
the
lord
exclaimed
the
old
gentleman
well
now
i
going
to
send
every
one
out
of
the
room
announced
pennell
authoritatively
hurry
now
he
clapped
his
hands
and
laughed
old
king
sat
quite
still
fully
determined
not
to
obey
but
the
doctor
looking
over
him
fixedly
seemed
to
expect
him
to
leave
and
although
he
still
had
that
pleasant
smile
he
did
exactly
give
the
impression
that
his
medical
authority
could
be
tampered
with
so
the
old
gentleman
found
himself
outside
the
door
and
now
we
must
find
joel
polly
was
saying
to
jasper
xviii
tom
story
joel
had
no
cause
to
complain
now
that
tom
beresford
did
not
stick
to
him
for
there
he
was
hanging
over
him
as
he
crouched
into
as
small
a
heap
as
possible
into
a
corner
of
mamsie
sofa
and
there
he
had
been
ever
since
joel
had
rushed
in
with
pennell
when
not
daring
to
trust
himself
up
in
ben
room
he
had
dashed
for
refuge
to
mamsie
old
sofa
tom
had
not
wasted
many
words
feeling
sure
under
similar
circumstances
he
should
like
to
be
talked
to
but
he
had
occasionally
patted
stubby
head
in
a
way
not
to
be
misunderstood
and
once
in
a
while
joel
thrust
out
a
brown
hand
which
tom
had
gripped
fast
it
all
right
old
boy
i
verily
believe
tom
cried
with
sudden
energy
so
brace
up
what
the
use
of
your
going
to
pieces
anyway
it
phronsie
gasped
joel
and
burrowing
deeper
into
the
cushion
well
i
know
it
said
tom
gulping
down
his
sorrow
for
he
had
petted
phronsie
a
good
deal
so
he
was
feeling
the
blow
quite
sharply
himself
but
you
wo
help
matters
along
any
i
tell
you
by
collapsing
go
out
into
the
hall
will
you
tom
begged
joel
huddling
down
unwilling
to
listen
himself
and
see
if
you
can
hear
anything
so
tom
skipping
out
into
the
wide
upper
hall
thankful
for
any
action
but
dreading
the
errand
stole
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
craned
his
ear
to
catch
the
faintest
sound
from
above
there
was
only
a
little
murmur
for
pennell
was
in
the
midst
of
operations
and
not
enough
to
report
thankful
that
it
was
no
worse
tom
skipped
back
all
quiet
along
the
potomac
exclaimed
joel
burrowing
deeper
suddenly
he
threw
himself
up
straight
and
regarded
tom
out
of
flashing
eyes
i
killed
phronsie
he
cried
huskily
and
you
know
it
and
wo
tell
me
joel
pepper
cried
tom
frightened
half
out
of
his
wits
and
rushing
to
him
lie
down
again
laying
a
firm
hand
on
his
shoulder
i
wo
roared
joel
wildly
and
shaking
him
off
you
keeping
something
from
me
tom
you
an
idiot
declared
tom
thinking
it
quite
time
to
be
a
howling
idiot
pepper
to
act
so
if
you
do
believe
me
when
i
say
i
have
anything
to
keep
back
from
you
i
go
straight
upstairs
some
one
will
tell
me
hurry
along
cried
joel
feverishly
but
tom
had
gotten
no
further
than
the
hall
when
joel
howled
come
back
tom
i
try
to
to
bear
it
and
tom
flying
back
joel
was
buried
as
far
as
his
face
went
in
mamsie
cushion
sobbing
as
if
his
heart
would
break
it
will
disturb
them
he
said
gustily
in
between
his
sobs
tom
beresford
let
him
cry
on
and
thrust
his
hands
in
his
pockets
to
stalk
up
and
down
the
room
he
longed
to
whistle
to
give
vent
to
his
feelings
but
concluding
that
would
be
understood
but
be
considered
heartless
he
held
himself
in
check
and
counted
the
slow
minutes
for
this
was
deadly
tiresome
and
beginning
to
get
on
his
nerves
i
shall
screech
myself
before
long
i
afraid
at
last
joel
rolled
over
come
here
do
tom
and
when
tom
got
there
glad
enough
to
be
of
use
joel
pulled
him
down
beside
the
sofa
and
gripped
him
as
only
joel
could
do
you
mind
tom
i
want
to
hang
on
to
something
no
indeed
said
tom
heartily
vastly
pleased
although
he
was
nearly
choked
now
you
behaving
better
he
patted
him
on
the
back
hark
joe
the
doctor
laughing
they
could
hear
it
distinctly
now
and
as
long
as
he
lived
joel
thought
he
never
heard
a
sweeter
sound
he
sprang
to
his
feet
upsetting
tom
who
rolled
over
on
his
back
to
the
floor
just
then
in
rushed
polly
and
jasper
surrounding
him
and
in
a
minute
oh
is
tom
sick
no
said
tom
picking
himself
up
grimly
only
joe
floored
me
he
was
so
glad
to
hear
the
doctor
laugh
oh
you
poor
poor
boy
polly
was
mothering
joel
now
just
as
mamsie
would
have
done
and
tom
looking
on
with
all
his
eyes
as
he
thought
of
his
own
home
with
neither
mother
nor
sister
did
hear
jasper
at
first
so
jasper
pulled
his
arm
see
here
beresford
you
and
i
will
go
down
to
the
library
i
think
all
right
said
tom
allowing
himself
to
be
led
off
though
he
would
much
have
preferred
remaining
now
joel
said
polly
after
they
had
gone
and
the
petting
had
continued
for
some
minutes
you
must
just
be
a
brave
boy
and
please
mamsie
and
stop
crying
for
joel
had
been
unable
to
stop
the
tears
i
i
did
see
phronsie
coming
wailed
joel
afresh
of
course
you
did
said
polly
stroking
his
black
curls
why
joey
pepper
did
you
think
for
an
instant
that
any
one
blamed
you
she
leaned
over
and
set
some
kisses
not
disturbing
joel
that
some
of
them
fell
on
his
stubby
nose
said
joel
through
the
rain
of
drops
down
his
cheeks
but
it
was
phronsie
polly
it
was
no
use
to
try
to
check
him
yet
for
the
boy
heart
was
almost
broken
and
so
polly
let
him
cry
on
but
she
bestowed
little
reassuring
pats
on
his
shaking
shoulders
all
the
while
saying
the
most
comforting
things
she
could
think
of
and
just
think
joey
she
cried
suddenly
you
were
the
one
who
found
pennell
oh
i
should
think
you
be
so
glad
i
am
glad
said
joel
beginning
to
feel
a
ray
of
comfort
and
how
quickly
you
brought
him
joe
said
polly
delighted
at
the
effect
of
her
last
remark
did
i
said
joel
in
a
surprised
way
and
roused
out
of
his
crying
i
thought
it
was
ever
so
long
polly
i
do
see
how
you
ever
did
it
joel
in
all
this
world
declared
polly
positively
joel
did
say
that
it
was
because
he
was
a
sprinter
at
school
he
found
himself
equal
to
the
job
nor
did
he
think
it
of
enough
importance
to
mention
how
many
people
he
had
run
into
leaving
a
great
amount
of
vexation
in
his
rear
as
he
sped
on
he
was
just
going
out
of
his
door
he
announced
simply
oh
joey
gasped
polly
then
she
hugged
him
rapturously
but
you
caught
him
yes
i
caught
him
and
we
jumped
into
his
carriage
and
that
all
but
it
was
something
to
be
always
proud
of
cried
polly
in
a
transport
joel
feeling
very
glad
that
there
was
something
to
be
proud
of
at
all
in
this
evening
transactions
sat
up
quite
straight
at
this
and
wiped
his
eyes
now
that
a
good
boy
said
polly
encouragingly
mamsie
will
be
very
glad
and
she
ran
over
to
get
a
towel
dip
it
in
the
water
basin
and
bring
it
back
oh
that
feels
so
good
said
joel
with
a
wintry
smile
as
she
sopped
his
red
eyelids
and
poor
swollen
nose
so
it
must
said
polly
pitifully
and
i
going
to
bring
the
basin
here
and
do
it
some
more
which
she
did
so
that
by
the
time
phronsie
was
brought
downstairs
to
sleep
in
fisher
room
joel
was
quite
presentable
here
they
come
announced
polly
radiantly
hearing
the
noise
on
the
stairs
and
running
back
to
set
the
basin
and
towel
in
their
places
now
joey
you
can
see
for
yourself
that
phronsie
is
all
right
and
there
she
was
perched
on
pennell
shoulder
to
be
sure
and
mamsie
hurrying
in
to
her
boy
and
everything
was
just
as
beautiful
as
it
could
be
see
joel
i
all
fixed
up
nice
laughed
phronsie
from
her
perch
illustration
see
joel
i
all
fixed
up
nice
laughed
phronsie
from
her
perch
joel
mouth
worked
dreadfully
but
he
saw
mamsie
eyes
so
he
piped
up
bravely
i
so
glad
phronsie
it
sounded
very
funnily
for
it
died
away
in
his
throat
and
he
could
have
said
another
word
possibly
but
phronsie
was
sleepy
and
did
notice
and
then
the
doctor
said
they
must
go
out
so
with
a
last
glance
at
phronsie
to
be
sure
that
she
was
all
right
joel
went
off
polly
holding
his
hand
the
next
evening
they
were
all
drawn
up
before
the
library
fire
polly
on
the
big
rug
with
joel
head
in
her
lap
his
eyes
fixed
on
phronsie
who
was
ensconced
in
an
close
to
which
grandpapa
was
sitting
tell
stories
do
polly
begged
van
yes
do
polly
said
little
dick
who
had
spent
most
of
the
day
in
trying
to
get
near
to
phronsie
keeping
other
people
very
much
occupied
in
driving
him
off
as
she
had
to
be
very
quiet
do
polly
he
begged
oh
polly
tired
said
jasper
knowing
that
she
had
been
with
phronsie
all
her
spare
time
and
looking
at
the
brown
eyes
which
were
drooping
a
bit
in
the
firelight
oh
no
i
will
said
polly
rousing
herself
and
feeling
that
she
ought
not
to
be
tired
when
phronsie
was
getting
well
so
fast
and
everything
was
so
beautiful
i
tell
you
one
let
me
see
what
shall
it
be
about
and
she
leant
her
head
in
her
hands
to
think
a
bit
let
her
off
said
jasper
do
boys
i
tell
you
one
instead
he
said
no
we
do
want
yours
said
van
not
very
politely
we
want
polly
for
shame
van
said
percy
who
dearly
loved
to
reprove
his
brother
and
never
allowed
the
occasion
to
slip
when
he
could
do
so
for
shame
yourself
retorted
van
flinging
himself
down
on
the
rug
you
everlastingly
teasing
polly
to
do
things
when
she
tired
to
death
so
there
percy
whitney
oh
i
tell
the
story
polly
said
hastily
bringing
her
brown
head
up
while
phronsie
began
to
look
troubled
i
like
to
tell
a
story
said
tom
beresford
slowly
where
he
sat
just
back
of
the
big
rug
all
the
young
folks
turned
to
regard
him
and
van
was
just
going
to
say
oh
we
do
want
yours
tom
when
polly
leaned
forward
oh
will
you
will
you
tom
so
eagerly
that
van
had
the
heart
to
object
yes
i
will
promised
tom
nodding
at
her
well
get
down
on
the
rug
then
said
jasper
moving
up
the
always
has
to
have
a
place
of
honor
here
that
so
cried
tom
well
here
goes
and
he
precipitated
himself
at
once
into
the
midst
of
things
ow
get
out
cried
van
crossly
and
giving
him
a
push
oh
vanny
said
polly
reprovingly
well
he
so
big
and
long
grumbled
van
who
did
fancy
anybody
coming
between
him
and
polly
i
might
cut
off
a
piece
of
my
legs
said
tom
to
oblige
you
i
suppose
they
are
rather
lengthy
and
that
a
fact
regarding
them
as
they
stretched
out
in
the
firelight
i
curl
up
in
a
twist
like
a
turk
which
he
did
well
now
said
jasper
we
are
ready
so
fire
ahead
beresford
joel
who
all
this
time
had
been
regarding
his
friend
curiously
having
never
heard
him
tell
a
story
at
marks
school
could
keep
his
eyes
from
him
but
regarded
him
with
a
fixed
stare
which
tom
was
careful
to
avoid
by
looking
steadily
into
the
fire
well
now
i
not
fine
at
expressing
myself
he
began
i
should
think
not
put
in
joel
uncomplimentarily
joe
you
beggar
hush
up
said
jasper
with
a
warning
pinch
yes
just
sit
on
that
individual
will
you
jasper
said
tom
over
his
shoulder
or
i
never
will
even
begin
so
jasper
promising
to
quench
all
further
disturbance
on
joel
part
the
story
was
taken
up
i
can
only
tell
a
plain
unvarnished
tale
said
tom
but
it
one
that
ought
to
be
told
and
in
this
very
spot
perhaps
you
do
any
of
you
know
that
in
marks
school
it
awfully
hard
to
be
good
is
it
any
harder
than
in
any
other
school
tom
asked
fisher
quietly
tom
turned
to
reply
i
do
know
fisher
because
i
have
been
at
any
other
school
but
i
ca
imagine
a
place
where
everything
is
made
so
hard
for
a
boy
to
begin
with
there
is
old
fox
oh
tom
exclaimed
phronsie
leaning
forward
whereat
old
king
laid
a
warning
hand
upon
the
well
arm
there
there
phronsie
sit
back
child
so
she
obeyed
but
grandpapa
he
said
there
was
an
old
fox
at
joey
school
she
declared
dreadfully
excited
and
lifting
her
face
to
his
well
and
so
she
is
phronsie
declared
tom
whirling
his
long
body
suddenly
around
thereby
receiving
a
dig
in
the
back
from
van
who
considered
him
intruding
on
his
space
a
fox
by
name
and
a
fox
by
nature
but
we
call
her
for
convenience
a
person
she
the
matron
said
percy
feeling
called
upon
to
explain
oh
said
phronsie
drawing
a
long
breath
but
i
thought
tom
said
she
was
a
fox
grandpapa
that
her
name
said
tom
nodding
at
her
jemima
fox
is
that
a
sweet
name
phronsie
i
do
think
it
is
a
sweet
one
tom
said
phronsie
feeling
quite
badly
to
be
obliged
to
say
so
i
agree
with
you
said
tom
while
the
others
all
laughed
well
phronsie
she
just
as
far
from
being
nice
as
her
name
is
oh
dear
me
exclaimed
phronsie
looking
quite
grieved
but
i
have
something
nice
to
tell
you
said
tom
quickly
so
hurry
on
and
let
the
other
personages
at
marks
slide
well
but
i
want
you
all
to
understand
though
and
he
wrinkled
up
his
brows
that
when
a
fellow
does
real
fine
things
at
that
school
it
means
something
you
will
wo
you
he
included
them
all
now
in
a
sweeping
glance
letting
his
blue
eyes
rest
the
longest
on
fisher
face
while
phronsie
broke
in
what
grandpapa
you
must
ask
tom
replied
grandpapa
with
a
little
laugh
oh
that
just
schoolboy
lingo
tom
made
haste
to
say
as
his
face
got
red
what
lingo
asked
phronsie
more
puzzled
than
before
that
that
oh
dear
tom
face
rivalled
the
firelight
by
this
time
for
color
phronsie
i
would
ask
any
more
questions
now
said
polly
gently
boys
say
so
many
things
and
it
is
necessary
to
know
now
listen
to
the
story
i
will
said
phronsie
feeling
quite
relieved
that
it
was
really
incumbent
on
her
to
ask
for
explanations
so
she
sat
back
quietly
in
her
big
chair
while
tom
shot
polly
a
grateful
look
well
there
are
lots
of
chaps
at
our
school
went
on
tom
i
suppose
there
are
at
all
schools
but
at
any
rate
we
have
them
in
a
big
quantity
who
are
mad
when
they
see
the
other
boys
get
on
oh
tom
exclaimed
polly
yes
they
are
mad
clear
through
declared
tom
positively
and
principally
in
athletics
phronsie
made
a
little
movement
at
this
word
but
remembering
that
she
was
not
to
ask
questions
for
polly
had
said
so
she
became
quiet
again
they
simply
ca
bear
that
a
boy
gets
ahead
of
it
just
knocks
all
up
tom
was
rushing
on
with
head
thrown
back
and
gazing
into
the
fire
tom
said
joel
bounding
up
suddenly
to
take
his
head
out
of
lap
and
to
sit
quite
straight
i
would
run
on
like
this
if
i
were
you
you
hush
up
pepper
said
tom
coolly
i
have
said
a
word
about
you
i
shall
say
what
i
like
i
tell
you
it
does
just
knock
all
up
i
know
for
i
been
that
way
myself
this
was
getting
on
such
dangerous
ground
that
joel
opened
his
mouth
to
remonstrate
but
polly
put
her
hand
over
it
i
let
tom
tell
his
story
just
as
he
wants
to
which
had
the
effect
of
smothering
speech
for
the
time
being
i
thought
jasper
you
were
going
to
quench
joe
observed
tom
who
seemed
to
have
the
power
to
see
out
of
the
back
of
his
head
and
now
was
conscious
of
the
disturbance
you
do
seem
to
be
much
good
oh
polly
doing
it
this
time
said
jasper
i
take
him
in
tow
on
the
next
offence
yes
i
have
declared
tom
been
that
way
myself
i
going
to
tell
you
how
and
then
i
feel
better
about
it
his
ruddy
face
turned
quite
pale
now
and
his
eyes
shone
stop
him
howled
joel
all
restraint
thrown
to
the
winds
and
shaking
off
polly
fingers
jasper
leaned
forward
i
bound
to
make
you
keep
the
peace
joe
he
said
shaking
his
arm
but
he
going
to
tell
about
things
he
ought
not
to
cried
joel
in
an
agony
do
stop
him
jasper
mother
fisher
leaned
forward
and
fastened
her
black
eyes
on
face
i
think
tom
better
go
on
joel
she
said
i
want
to
hear
it
that
settled
the
matter
and
joel
threw
himself
down
his
face
buried
in
polly
lap
while
he
stuck
his
fingers
in
his
ears
i
going
to
tell
you
all
this
story
tom
was
saying
because
i
ought
to
you
wo
like
me
very
well
after
it
but
it
got
to
come
out
well
i
might
as
well
mention
names
now
since
joe
has
got
to
keep
still
you
ca
guess
how
he
been
tormented
by
some
of
those
cads
simply
because
he
our
best
tennis
player
and
on
the
football
team
they
made
things
hum
for
him
tom
threw
back
his
head
and
clenched
his
fist
where
it
lay
in
his
lap
and
the
rest
of
us
boys
got
mad
especially
at
one
of
them
he
was
the
ringleader
and
the
biggest
cad
and
bully
of
them
all
no
one
said
a
word
i
hate
to
mention
names
it
seems
awfully
mean
tom
face
got
fiery
red
again
and
yet
as
you
all
know
why
it
ca
be
helped
jenkins
well
there
a
fellow
would
want
to
be
excused
from
speaking
to
him
and
yet
down
fell
tom
head
shamefacedly
i
let
him
show
me
how
he
was
going
to
play
a
dastardly
trick
on
joe
the
very
day
of
the
tennis
tournament
i
did
that
a
fact
no
one
spoke
but
tom
could
feel
what
might
have
been
said
had
the
thoughts
all
been
expressed
and
he
burst
out
desperately
i
let
that
cad
take
joe
racket
a
general
rustle
as
if
some
speech
were
coming
made
him
forestall
it
by
plunging
on
his
beautiful
racket
he
been
practising
with
for
this
tournament
and
i
not
only
did
knock
the
scoundrel
down
but
i
helped
the
thing
along
i
would
have
supposed
i
could
do
it
joe
was
to
play
with
ricketson
against
green
and
me
and
two
minutes
after
it
was
done
i
have
given
everything
to
have
had
it
back
on
joe
table
but
the
boys
were
pouring
up
and
it
was
hidden
tom
could
get
no
further
but
hung
his
head
for
the
reaction
sure
to
set
in
against
him
by
all
this
household
that
had
welcomed
and
entertained
him
so
handsomely
has
he
got
through
has
the
beggar
finished
cried
joel
lustily
yes
said
polly
in
a
low
voice
i
think
he
has
joel
then
i
want
to
say
joel
threw
himself
over
by
tom
his
arms
around
him
that
he
the
biggest
fraud
to
spring
such
a
trap
on
me
and
plan
to
get
off
that
yarn
here
i
did
intend
to
when
i
came
said
tom
thinking
it
necessary
to
tell
the
whole
truth
i
had
the
courage
pity
you
had
now
retorted
joel
oh
you
beggar
he
laid
his
round
cheek
against
tom
mamsie
grandpapa
polly
his
black
eyes
sweeping
the
circle
if
i
were
to
tell
you
all
that
this
chap
has
done
for
me
why
he
took
me
to
the
place
where
jenk
hid
the
racket
pshaw
that
was
nothing
said
tom
curtly
nothing
well
i
got
it
in
time
for
the
tournament
you
saw
to
that
and
when
jenk
and
i
were
having
it
out
in
the
pine
grove
that
night
tom
thought
he
better
tell
dave
though
i
ca
say
i
thank
you
for
that
brought
up
joel
regretfully
for
i
was
getting
the
best
of
jenk
old
king
had
held
himself
well
in
check
up
to
this
point
how
did
you
know
tom
my
boy
that
joel
and
er
this
jenk
furnished
joel
yes
er
jenk
were
going
to
settle
it
that
night
why
you
see
sir
tom
in
memory
of
the
excitement
and
pride
over
joel
prowess
so
far
recovered
himself
as
to
turn
to
answer
joel
could
very
well
finish
it
there
for
the
dormitory
got
too
hot
for
that
sort
of
thing
although
it
would
have
been
rare
good
sport
for
all
the
fellows
to
have
seen
jenk
flat
for
he
was
always
beating
other
chaps
i
mean
little
ones
not
half
his
size
oh
dear
me
breathed
polly
indignantly
yes
well
joe
promised
jenk
he
would
finish
it
some
other
time
and
jenk
dared
him
and
taunted
him
after
the
tournament
he
was
wild
with
rage
because
joel
won
and
he
lost
his
head
or
he
would
have
let
joe
alone
i
see
exclaimed
grandpapa
his
eyes
shining
well
and
so
you
sat
up
and
watched
the
affair
i
could
go
to
bed
you
know
said
tom
simply
and
he
would
have
saved
us
dave
and
me
if
that
jenk
had
locked
the
door
on
us
when
he
slipped
in
cad
exclaimed
tom
between
his
teeth
he
ought
to
have
been
expelled
for
that
and
then
joe
shinned
up
the
conductor
and
you
know
the
rest
mother
fisher
shivered
and
leaned
over
involuntarily
toward
her
boy
mamsie
exclaimed
joel
you
do
know
what
tom
is
to
me
in
that
school
he
just
royal
that
what
he
is
with
a
resounding
slap
on
his
back
and
i
say
so
too
declared
mother
fisher
with
shining
eyes
roared
tom
whirling
around
so
suddenly
that
van
this
time
got
out
of
the
way
only
by
rolling
entirely
off
from
the
rug
fisher
you
after
i
told
you
this
although
i
sorry
about
the
racket
i
did
want
to
tell
fought
against
it
but
i
had
to
i
stand
by
what
i
said
tom
said
fisher
putting
out
her
hand
when
tom
immediately
laid
his
big
brown
one
within
it
at
this
joel
howled
with
delight
which
he
was
unable
to
express
enough
to
meet
his
wishes
so
he
plunged
off
to
the
middle
of
the
library
floor
and
turned
a
brace
of
somersaults
coming
up
red
and
shining
i
feel
better
now
he
said
that
the
way
i
used
to
do
in
the
little
brown
house
when
i
liked
things
xix
the
grand
entertainment
ought
we
to
mamsie
asked
polly
jasper
and
she
were
in
room
and
they
both
waited
for
the
reply
anxiously
yes
polly
i
think
you
ought
said
mother
fisher
oh
dear
me
phronsie
ca
have
only
a
little
bit
of
it
said
polly
i
know
it
but
think
polly
the
boys
have
to
go
back
to
school
so
soon
that
even
if
other
people
did
care
if
it
were
postponed
they
would
lose
it
besides
tom
is
to
be
one
of
the
chief
people
on
the
program
no
no
polly
there
are
others
to
think
of
outside
of
ourselves
you
must
have
your
entertainment
just
as
it
is
planned
fisher
brought
up
very
decidedly
well
sighed
polly
i
am
glad
that
papa
fisher
says
that
phronsie
can
hear
a
little
part
of
it
anyway
yes
said
her
mother
cheerfully
and
helen
fargo
is
to
sit
next
to
her
fargo
is
to
take
her
home
early
as
she
has
not
been
very
well
so
you
see
polly
it
will
all
turn
out
very
good
after
all
but
i
did
so
want
phronsie
to
be
there
through
the
whole
mourned
polly
so
did
i
echoed
jasper
then
he
caught
mother
fisher
eye
but
polly
the
boys
would
lose
it
then
he
added
quickly
oh
cried
polly
so
they
would
i
keep
forgetting
that
dear
me
why
is
everything
just
right
so
that
they
all
could
hear
it
and
she
gave
a
little
flounce
everything
is
just
right
polly
said
fisher
gravely
do
let
me
hear
you
complain
of
things
that
no
one
can
help
i
did
mean
to
complain
mamsie
said
polly
humbly
and
she
crept
up
to
her
while
jasper
looked
very
much
distressed
mother
knows
you
did
said
fisher
putting
her
arm
around
her
but
it
a
bad
habit
polly
to
be
impatient
when
things
do
go
rightly
now
run
away
both
of
you
she
finished
brightly
and
work
up
your
program
and
she
set
a
kiss
on
polly
rosy
cheek
jasper
cried
polly
with
happiness
once
more
in
her
heart
as
they
raced
off
i
tell
you
what
we
can
do
we
must
change
the
program
and
put
those
things
that
phronsie
likes
up
first
that
so
cried
jasper
well
pleased
now
what
will
they
be
polly
why
dyce
story
of
the
dog
said
polly
for
one
thing
phronsie
thinks
that
perfectly
lovely
and
always
asks
him
for
it
when
he
tells
her
stories
all
right
said
jasper
what
next
why
tom
must
sing
one
of
his
funny
songs
yes
of
course
that
will
please
her
ever
so
much
cried
jasper
do
you
know
how
she
claps
her
hands
when
he
rehearsing
polly
yes
oh
i
would
have
her
miss
that
for
anything
jasper
said
polly
no
indeed
cried
jasper
heartily
well
polly
then
what
ought
to
come
next
let
come
into
the
den
and
fix
it
up
now
so
they
ran
into
the
den
and
jasper
got
out
the
long
program
all
ready
to
be
pinned
up
beside
the
improvised
stage
on
the
evening
of
the
great
event
and
spread
it
on
the
table
polly
meanwhile
clearing
off
the
books
let
see
he
wrinkled
up
his
brow
running
his
finger
down
the
whole
length
now
when
i
make
the
new
program
dyce
goes
first
polly
stood
quite
still
at
that
oh
jasper
we
ca
do
it
no
never
in
all
this
world
why
polly
he
turned
suddenly
yes
we
can
just
as
easily
see
polly
we
ca
spoil
that
lovely
program
that
took
you
so
long
to
make
for
anything
said
polly
in
a
decisive
fashion
phronsie
would
want
it
she
added
phronsie
is
to
know
anything
about
it
said
jasper
just
as
decidedly
well
but
jasper
you
ca
make
another
you
have
the
time
said
polly
in
great
distress
and
wishing
she
had
said
anything
about
the
changes
i
did
think
there
would
have
to
be
a
new
program
made
oh
polly
i
think
we
better
have
a
new
one
said
jasper
who
was
very
particular
about
everything
i
thought
we
were
going
to
have
changes
announced
from
the
stage
said
polly
oh
why
ca
we
jasper
i
sure
they
do
that
very
often
well
that
when
the
changes
come
at
the
last
moment
said
jasper
reluctantly
well
i
sure
this
is
the
last
moment
said
polly
the
entertainment
is
night
and
we
ever
so
much
to
do
yet
jasper
that
please
jasper
won
the
day
all
right
polly
he
said
well
now
let
see
what
ought
to
come
after
tom
song
well
phronsie
is
very
anxious
to
hear
pickering
piece
i
know
because
i
heard
her
tell
mamsie
so
why
she
has
heard
pick
recite
that
ever
so
many
times
since
he
learned
it
for
our
school
exhibition
said
jasper
and
do
you
know
that
just
the
very
reason
why
she
wants
it
again
said
polly
with
a
little
laugh
yes
of
course
said
jasper
laughing
too
well
she
must
have
it
then
so
down
goes
pick
he
ran
to
the
table
drawer
and
drew
out
a
big
sheet
of
paper
first
dyce
then
tom
beresford
then
pickering
dodge
writing
fast
and
then
said
polly
running
up
to
look
over
his
shoulder
phronsie
wants
dreadfully
to
hear
tom
play
on
his
banjo
oh
polly
jasper
threw
back
his
head
to
look
at
her
i
believe
there
be
time
for
all
that
you
know
the
music
by
miss
taylor
comes
first
as
an
overture
we
ca
change
that
why
exclaimed
polly
in
dismay
we
must
jasper
get
tom
banjo
in
and
there
percy
piece
phronsie
would
miss
that
for
why
we
shall
have
the
whole
program
in
if
we
keep
on
said
jasper
looking
at
her
in
dismay
oh
jasper
papa
fisher
says
that
phronsie
may
stay
in
twenty
minutes
just
think
we
can
do
a
lot
in
twenty
minutes
but
somebody
is
bound
to
be
late
so
we
ca
begin
on
time
nobody
ever
does
polly
we
must
said
polly
passionately
begin
on
time
night
jasper
we
try
said
jasper
as
cheerfully
as
he
could
manage
and
there
your
piece
why
jasper
phronsie
told
me
herself
that
she
hear
yours
well
and
so
she
told
me
that
she
rather
hear
you
play
your
piece
said
jasper
but
you
and
i
polly
as
long
as
we
change
the
program
ca
come
in
among
the
first
no
of
course
not
said
polly
but
oh
jasper
and
she
gave
a
sigh
it
too
bad
that
you
ca
recite
yours
for
it
is
most
beautiful
polly
clasped
her
hands
and
sighed
again
well
that
not
to
be
thought
of
said
jasper
now
i
tell
you
how
we
fix
it
polly
he
said
quickly
how
asked
polly
gloomily
why
we
have
twenty
minutes
that
phronsie
can
stay
in
now
let
mark
off
all
those
things
that
she
wants
except
yours
and
mine
even
if
they
come
beyond
the
time
and
then
we
draw
just
those
that
will
get
into
the
twenty
minutes
oh
jasper
what
a
fine
idea
exclaimed
polly
all
her
enthusiasm
returning
well
mark
off
half
of
and
i
write
the
others
said
jasper
tearing
off
strips
from
his
big
sheet
of
paper
so
polly
and
he
fell
to
work
and
presently
pick
and
tom
that
for
the
song
said
polly
and
banjo
and
dyce
and
percy
went
down
on
the
little
strips
oh
and
i
forgot
said
polly
raising
her
head
from
her
last
strip
phronsie
wanted
to
hear
clare
very
much
indeed
illustration
oh
i
do
hope
i
shall
draw
the
right
one
jasper
well
we
should
have
had
the
whole
program
with
a
vengeance
said
jasper
bursting
into
a
laugh
well
put
him
down
polly
so
clare
went
down
on
another
strip
and
then
they
were
all
jumbled
up
in
a
little
chinese
bowl
on
the
bookcase
now
you
draw
first
polly
said
jasper
oh
no
let
us
choose
for
first
draw
said
polly
that
the
way
to
be
absolutely
right
so
she
ran
back
to
the
table
and
tore
off
two
more
strips
one
short
and
the
other
long
and
fixed
them
in
between
her
hands
you
did
see
she
asked
over
her
shoulder
not
a
wink
said
jasper
laughing
so
polly
ran
back
and
jasper
drew
the
short
one
there
you
have
it
polly
he
cried
gleefully
oh
that
good
oh
i
do
hope
i
shall
draw
the
right
one
jasper
she
said
standing
on
tiptoe
her
fingers
trembling
over
the
bowl
they
are
all
of
them
good
said
jasper
encouragingly
so
polly
suddenly
picked
out
one
and
together
they
read
tom
fine
they
shouted
oh
is
that
perfectly
splendid
cried
polly
because
you
see
phronsie
did
so
very
much
wish
to
hear
tom
sing
just
as
if
she
mentioned
that
fact
before
now
jasper
i
in
much
the
same
predicament
as
you
were
said
jasper
pausing
his
hand
over
the
bowl
if
i
should
choose
the
right
one
polly
they
are
all
of
them
good
said
polly
laughing
at
his
face
oh
i
know
but
it
is
a
fearful
responsibility
said
jasper
wrinkling
his
brows
worse
yet
well
here
goes
he
plunged
his
fingers
in
and
out
they
came
with
the
strip
percy
now
jasper
you
could
possibly
have
chosen
better
declared
polly
hopping
up
and
down
for
phronsie
did
so
want
to
hear
percy
speak
and
it
will
please
percy
so
oh
i
so
glad
well
i
thankful
i
have
to
draw
again
declared
jasper
for
we
ca
have
but
three
pieces
beside
the
overture
you
know
so
it
your
turn
now
polly
oh
dear
me
exclaimed
polly
the
color
dying
down
in
her
cheek
if
i
should
draw
the
right
one
jasper
king
and
it
the
last
chance
she
stood
so
long
with
her
hand
poised
over
the
chinese
bowl
that
jasper
finally
laughed
out
oh
polly
are
your
tiptoes
tired
not
half
so
tired
as
i
am
said
polly
grimly
jasper
i
going
to
run
across
the
room
and
then
run
back
and
draw
suddenly
without
stopping
to
think
do
cried
jasper
so
polly
ran
into
the
further
corner
and
came
flying
up
to
get
on
her
tiptoes
thrust
in
her
fingers
and
bring
out
the
third
and
last
strip
the
deed
is
done
exclaimed
jasper
now
polly
let
see
who
it
is
pick
he
shouted
and
pickering
screamed
polly
and
they
took
hold
of
hands
and
spun
round
and
round
the
den
oh
dear
we
knocking
off
your
beautiful
program
cried
polly
pausing
in
dismay
it
has
hurt
it
any
our
mad
whirl
has
said
jasper
picking
up
the
long
program
where
it
had
slipped
off
the
table
to
the
floor
polly
you
ca
think
how
i
wanted
pick
to
be
chosen
it
will
do
him
so
much
good
and
only
think
if
i
had
chosen
him
out
of
that
bowl
cried
polly
in
dismay
at
the
very
thought
well
you
did
polly
so
it
all
right
said
jasper
now
everything
is
fixed
and
it
going
to
be
the
finest
affair
that
ever
was
he
added
enthusiastically
and
the
best
of
it
is
i
ca
help
it
polly
that
chatterton
is
to
come
back
till
next
week
he
brought
up
in
great
satisfaction
chatterton
had
gone
to
new
york
for
some
weeks
but
was
to
return
to
finish
her
visit
at
cousin
horatio
and
i
am
so
glad
too
confessed
polly
but
feeling
as
if
she
to
say
it
and
is
everything
just
beautiful
jasper
i
should
think
it
was
cried
jasper
jubilantly
just
as
perfect
as
can
be
polly
and
the
next
afternoon
when
the
last
preparations
for
the
grand
entertainment
were
made
and
everybody
was
rushing
off
to
dress
for
dinner
a
carriage
drove
up
the
winding
driveway
there
were
big
trunks
on
the
rack
and
two
people
inside
joel
racing
along
the
hall
with
tom
at
his
heels
took
one
look
oh
whickets
he
ejaculated
stopping
short
to
bring
his
feet
down
with
a
thud
what
the
row
asked
tom
plunging
up
to
him
in
amazement
that
person
joel
pointed
a
finger
at
the
carriage
i
must
tell
polly
and
off
he
darted
tom
not
feeling
at
all
sure
that
he
ought
to
wait
to
see
that
person
wheeled
about
and
followed
polly
roared
joel
long
before
he
got
to
her
she
come
has
she
polly
called
back
supposing
he
meant
alexia
well
tell
her
to
come
up
here
joe
in
my
room
joel
took
the
stairs
two
at
a
time
tom
waiting
below
and
dashed
into
the
blue
and
white
room
without
ceremony
polly
you
do
understand
he
blurted
out
she
come
polly
had
her
head
bent
over
a
drawer
picking
out
some
ribbons
at
the
sound
of
joel
voice
she
drew
it
out
and
looked
at
him
why
how
funny
you
look
joe
she
said
what
is
the
matter
i
guess
you
look
funny
said
joel
glumly
if
you
seen
mrs
chatterton
chatterton
exclaimed
polly
aghast
and
jumping
up
her
face
very
pale
and
upsetting
her
box
of
ribbons
she
seized
arm
tell
me
this
very
minute
joel
pepper
she
commanded
what
do
you
mean
chatterton
has
just
come
i
saw
her
coming
up
the
drive
johnson
now
letting
her
in
joel
had
it
all
out
now
in
a
burst
ready
to
cry
at
sight
of
polly
face
as
the
bustle
in
the
hall
below
and
the
thin
high
voice
proclaimed
the
worst
oh
joel
joel
mourned
polly
releasing
his
arm
to
wring
her
hands
what
we
do
she
an
old
harpy
declared
joel
mean
horrid
old
thing
oh
stop
joel
cried
polly
quite
horrified
well
she
is
said
joel
vindictively
to
come
before
we
got
back
to
school
well
do
say
so
begged
polly
having
hard
work
to
keep
back
her
own
words
crowding
for
utterance
mamsie
would
like
it
joey
joel
with
this
thought
on
his
mind
only
grumbled
out
something
so
faintly
that
really
polly
could
hear
as
she
ran
out
into
the
hall
oh
jasper
polly
did
you
know
what
we
do
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
conceal
his
vexation
and
polly
lost
sight
of
her
own
discomfiture
in
the
attempt
to
comfort
him
and
father
it
will
just
make
him
as
miserable
as
can
be
said
jasper
gloomily
and
he
was
so
happy
over
the
beautiful
time
we
were
going
to
have
this
evening
he
was
so
vexed
he
could
do
nothing
but
prance
up
and
down
the
hall
well
we
must
make
him
forget
that
she
is
here
said
polly
swallowing
her
own
distress
at
the
change
of
all
the
conditions
how
can
we
polly
jasper
stopped
for
a
minute
and
stared
at
her
i
mean
said
polly
feeling
that
it
was
a
very
hopeless
case
after
all
that
we
must
show
that
we
mind
it
her
coming
back
and
must
act
as
if
we
forgot
it
and
then
that
will
keep
him
happy
perhaps
if
you
only
will
polly
cried
jasper
seizing
both
of
her
hands
it
will
be
the
best
piece
of
work
you
ever
did
oh
i
ca
do
it
alone
exclaimed
polly
in
consternation
never
in
all
this
world
jasper
unless
you
help
too
then
we
both
try
our
very
best
said
jasper
i
sure
i
ought
to
be
mean
enough
to
expect
you
to
go
at
such
a
task
alone
oh
you
could
be
mean
jasper
declared
polly
in
horror
at
the
very
thought
well
i
should
be
if
i
left
you
to
tackle
this
by
yourself
said
jasper
with
a
grim
little
laugh
so
polly
there
my
hand
on
it
help
you
and
polly
ran
back
to
pick
up
her
ribbons
and
dress
for
dinner
feeling
somehow
very
happy
after
all
that
there
was
something
she
could
do
for
dear
grandpapa
to
help
him
bear
this
great
calamity
tom
beresford
meanwhile
withdrew
from
the
great
hall
when
johnson
ushered
in
the
tall
stately
woman
and
her
french
maid
and
took
shelter
in
the
library
and
whitney
coming
over
the
stairs
saying
well
cousin
eunice
did
you
have
a
pleasant
journey
in
the
gentle
voice
tom
so
loved
gave
him
the
first
inkling
of
the
relationship
but
he
wrinkled
his
brows
at
joel
exclamation
and
his
queer
way
of
rushing
off
you
know
journeys
always
tire
me
marian
so
that
your
question
is
quite
useless
i
will
sit
in
the
library
a
moment
to
recover
myself
hortense
go
up
and
prepare
my
room
and
she
sailed
into
the
apartment
her
heavy
silk
gown
swishing
close
to
tom
chair
who
is
that
boy
she
demanded
sharply
then
she
put
up
her
lorgnette
and
examined
him
closely
as
if
of
a
new
and
probably
dangerous
species
tom
slipped
off
from
his
chair
and
stiffened
up
it
one
of
joel
friends
said
whitney
slipping
her
hand
within
the
tall
boy
arm
the
boys
are
at
home
from
school
for
a
week
joel
friends
repeated
chatterton
paying
scant
attention
to
the
rest
of
the
information
then
she
gave
a
scornful
cackle
you
gotten
over
that
nonsense
yet
marian
she
asked
no
and
i
trust
i
never
shall
replied
whitney
with
a
happy
smile
now
cousin
eunice
as
you
wish
to
rest
we
will
go
and
she
drew
tom
off
my
boy
she
said
releasing
him
in
the
hall
to
give
a
bright
glance
up
at
the
stormy
astonished
face
above
her
i
know
you
and
joel
will
get
dressed
as
rapidly
as
possible
for
dinner
for
my
father
will
not
want
to
be
annoyed
by
a
lack
of
promptness
she
did
not
say
because
he
will
have
annoyance
enough
but
tom
guessed
it
all
i
will
whitney
he
promised
heartily
and
thinking
he
would
go
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
for
her
to
be
smiled
on
like
that
he
plunged
off
over
the
stairs
i
seen
the
old
cat
he
cried
in
smothered
wrath
to
joel
rushing
into
his
room
joel
sat
disconsolately
on
the
edge
of
his
bed
kicking
off
his
heavy
shoes
to
replace
with
his
evening
ones
have
you
said
joel
grimly
well
is
she
a
then
he
remembered
mamsie
and
snapped
his
lips
to
exclaimed
tom
in
smothered
wrath
as
he
closed
the
door
she
is
at
all
joe
she
well
do
be
still
cried
joel
putting
on
his
best
shoes
nervously
or
you
have
me
saying
something
and
she
visiting
here
and
mamsie
would
like
it
do
tom
he
begged
i
wo
said
tom
with
a
monstrous
effort
but
oh
dear
me
then
he
rushed
into
his
own
room
and
banged
about
getting
his
best
clothes
out
shut
the
door
roared
joel
after
him
or
you
begin
to
fume
and
i
ca
stand
it
tom
it
will
set
me
off
so
tom
shut
the
door
and
with
all
these
precautions
going
on
over
the
house
all
the
family
in
due
time
appeared
at
dinner
prepared
as
best
they
could
be
to
bear
the
infliction
of
chatterton
return
and
after
the
conclusion
of
the
meal
why
everybody
tried
to
forget
it
as
much
as
possible
and
give
themselves
up
to
the
grand
affair
of
the
evening
and
old
king
who
had
been
consumed
with
fear
that
it
would
have
a
disastrous
effect
on
polly
and
jasper
the
chief
of
the
entertainment
came
out
of
his
fright
nicely
for
there
they
were
as
bright
and
jolly
as
ever
and
fully
equal
to
any
demands
upon
them
so
he
made
up
his
mind
that
after
all
he
could
put
up
with
cousin
eunice
a
bit
longer
and
that
the
affair
was
to
be
an
immense
success
and
the
very
finest
thing
possible
and
everybody
else
who
was
present
on
the
eventful
occasion
said
so
too
and
it
seemed
as
if
king
spacious
famous
for
its
capacity
at
all
such
times
could
possibly
have
admitted
another
person
to
this
entertainment
for
the
benefit
of
the
poor
family
and
joel
who
was
good
at
recitations
and
who
detested
all
that
sort
of
thing
and
van
for
the
same
reason
were
both
in
their
element
as
ticket
takers
and
the
little
pink
and
yellow
squares
came
in
so
thick
and
fast
that
both
boys
had
all
they
could
do
for
a
while
which
was
saying
a
good
deal
to
collect
them
and
everybody
said
that
miss
mary
taylor
had
never
played
such
a
beautiful
overture
and
she
was
capable
of
a
good
deal
along
that
line
in
all
her
life
and
phronsie
sitting
well
to
the
front
between
old
king
and
helen
fargo
forgot
that
she
ever
had
a
hurt
arm
and
that
it
lay
bandaged
up
in
her
lap
and
little
dick
when
he
could
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
he
next
to
phronsie
instead
of
helen
fargo
snuggled
up
contentedly
against
mother
fisher
and
applauded
everything
straight
through
and
old
king
protested
that
he
was
perfectly
satisfied
with
the
whole
thing
which
was
saying
the
most
that
could
be
expressed
for
the
quality
of
the
entertainment
and
he
took
particular
pains
to
applaud
tom
beresford
who
looked
very
handsome
and
acquitted
himself
well
i
must
said
tom
to
himself
although
quaking
inwardly
for
all
been
so
good
to
me
and
for
joel
sake
so
he
sang
at
his
very
best
and
he
played
his
banjo
merrily
and
he
was
encored
and
encored
and
joel
was
as
proud
as
could
be
which
did
tom
good
to
see
and
percy
well
the
tears
of
joy
came
into
his
mother
eyes
for
it
was
easy
for
him
to
learn
pieces
nor
in
fact
to
apply
himself
to
study
at
all
but
no
one
would
have
suspected
it
to
see
him
now
on
that
stage
and
grandpapa
king
was
so
overjoyed
that
he
called
bravo
bravo
ever
so
many
times
which
carried
percy
on
triumphantly
over
the
difficult
spots
where
he
had
been
afraid
he
should
slip
if
only
his
father
could
hear
him
sighed
whitney
in
the
midst
of
her
joy
longing
as
she
always
did
for
the
time
when
the
father
could
finish
those
trips
over
the
sea
for
his
business
house
polly
had
made
jasper
consent
which
he
did
reluctantly
to
give
his
recitation
before
she
played
insisting
that
music
was
really
better
for
a
finale
and
she
listened
with
such
delight
to
the
applause
that
he
received
for
ever
so
many
of
the
audience
said
it
was
the
gem
of
the
whole
that
she
quite
forgot
to
be
nervous
about
her
own
performance
and
she
played
her
nocturne
with
such
a
happy
heart
thinking
over
the
lovely
evening
and
how
the
money
would
be
oh
such
a
heap
to
take
down
on
the
morrow
to
the
poor
brakeman
home
that
jasper
was
turning
the
last
page
of
her
music
and
the
entertainment
was
at
an
end
polly
hopped
off
from
the
music
stool
there
was
a
great
clapping
all
over
the
room
and
grandpapa
called
out
yes
child
play
again
so
there
was
nothing
for
polly
to
do
but
to
hop
back
again
and
give
them
another
selection
and
then
they
clapped
harder
yet
but
polly
shook
her
brown
head
and
rushed
off
the
stage
and
then
of
course
grandpapa
gave
them
as
he
always
did
a
fine
party
to
wind
up
the
evening
with
and
the
camp
chairs
were
folded
up
and
carried
off
and
a
company
of
musicians
came
into
the
alcove
in
the
spacious
hall
and
all
through
the
beautiful
large
apartments
festivity
reigned
look
at
the
old
cat
said
tom
in
a
smothered
aside
to
joel
his
next
neighbor
in
the
sir
roger
de
coverley
is
she
a
sight
i
do
want
to
said
joel
with
a
grimace
and
it
awfully
mean
in
you
tom
to
ask
me
i
know
it
said
tom
penitently
but
i
ca
keep
my
eyes
off
from
her
how
your
grandfather
can
stand
it
pepper
i
do
see
and
a
good
many
other
people
were
asking
themselves
the
same
question
madam
dyce
among
the
number
to
whom
chatterton
was
just
remarking
cousin
horatio
is
certainly
not
the
same
man
no
replied
madam
dyce
distinctly
he
is
infinitely
improved
so
approachable
now
you
mistake
me
chatterton
said
angrily
i
mean
there
is
the
greatest
change
come
over
him
it
lamentable
and
all
brought
about
by
his
inexplicable
infatuation
over
those
pepper
children
and
their
designing
mother
chatterton
said
madam
dyce
she
could
be
quite
as
stately
as
king
cousin
and
as
she
felt
in
secure
possession
of
the
right
in
the
case
she
was
vastly
more
impressive
i
am
not
here
to
go
over
this
question
nor
shall
i
discuss
it
anywhere
with
you
you
know
my
mind
about
it
i
only
wish
i
had
the
peppers
yes
every
single
one
of
them
warmed
up
the
old
lady
in
my
house
and
that
fine
woman
their
mother
along
with
them
xx
the
corcoran
family
and
on
the
morrow
oh
what
a
heap
of
money
there
was
for
the
poor
brakeman
family
four
hundred
and
twelve
dollars
for
a
good
many
people
had
fairly
insisted
on
paying
twice
the
amount
for
their
tickets
and
a
good
many
more
had
paid
when
they
could
take
tickets
at
all
going
out
of
town
or
for
some
other
good
reason
and
one
old
lady
a
great
friend
of
the
family
sent
for
polly
pepper
the
week
before
and
when
polly
appeared
before
the
big
lounge
for
sterling
was
lifted
from
her
bed
to
lie
under
the
all
day
she
said
now
my
dear
i
want
to
take
some
tickets
for
that
affair
of
yours
gibbons
get
my
so
gibbons
the
maid
brought
the
and
drew
up
the
little
stand
with
the
upon
it
close
to
the
lounge
and
sterling
did
a
bit
of
writing
and
presently
she
held
out
a
long
green
slip
of
paper
oh
cried
polly
in
huge
delight
i
never
had
one
for
my
very
own
self
before
there
it
was
polly
pepper
running
clear
across
its
face
and
oh
with
wide
eyes
when
she
saw
the
amount
dollars
have
you
so
said
sterling
greatly
pleased
to
be
the
first
in
one
of
polly
pleasures
oh
cried
polly
again
dollars
and
she
threw
herself
down
before
the
lounge
and
dropped
a
kiss
upon
the
hand
that
had
made
all
this
happiness
for
the
brakeman
poor
children
well
now
polly
tell
me
all
about
it
said
sterling
with
a
glow
at
her
heart
warm
enough
to
brighten
many
a
long
invalid
day
gibbons
get
a
cricket
for
miss
mary
oh
may
i
sit
here
begged
polly
eagerly
as
gibbons
placing
the
little
back
into
position
now
approached
with
the
cricket
it
so
cosey
on
the
floor
why
yes
if
you
do
wish
the
cricket
said
sterling
with
a
little
laugh
and
i
remember
when
i
was
your
age
it
was
my
greatest
delight
to
sit
on
the
floor
it
is
mine
said
polly
snuggling
up
to
the
sterling
put
out
her
thin
hand
and
took
polly
rosy
palm
now
begin
dear
she
said
with
an
air
of
content
and
looking
down
into
the
bright
face
so
polly
realizing
that
here
perhaps
was
need
for
help
quite
as
much
as
in
the
poor
brakeman
home
though
in
a
different
way
told
the
whole
story
how
the
two
clubs
the
salisbury
school
club
and
the
club
had
joined
together
to
help
jim
corcoran
children
how
they
had
had
a
big
meeting
at
jasper
house
and
promised
each
other
to
take
hold
faithfully
and
work
for
that
object
we
were
going
to
have
a
little
play
observed
polly
a
bit
sorrowfully
but
it
was
thought
best
not
so
it
will
be
recitations
and
music
those
will
be
very
nice
i
am
quite
sure
polly
said
sterling
how
i
should
love
to
hear
some
of
them
it
was
her
turn
to
look
sad
now
why
polly
sat
up
quite
straight
now
and
her
cheeks
turned
rosy
what
is
it
my
child
asked
sterling
would
you
i
mean
do
you
want
oh
sterling
would
you
like
us
to
come
here
some
time
to
recite
something
to
you
sterling
turned
an
eager
face
on
her
pillow
are
you
sure
polly
a
light
coming
into
her
tired
eyes
that
you
young
people
would
be
willing
to
come
to
entertain
a
dull
sick
old
woman
oh
i
am
sure
they
would
cried
polly
if
you
would
like
it
dear
mrs
sterling
it
sterling
turned
her
thin
face
to
the
wall
for
a
moment
when
she
looked
again
at
polly
there
were
tears
trickling
down
the
wasted
cheeks
polly
you
do
know
she
said
brokenly
how
i
just
long
to
hear
young
voices
here
in
this
dreary
old
house
to
lie
here
day
after
day
child
oh
cried
polly
suddenly
it
must
be
so
very
dreadful
mrs
sterling
well
do
let
us
speak
of
that
said
sterling
breaking
off
quickly
her
train
of
thought
for
the
worst
is
the
pain
and
the
weakness
polly
it
the
loneliness
child
oh
said
polly
then
it
all
rushed
over
her
how
she
might
have
run
in
before
and
taken
the
other
girls
if
she
had
only
known
but
we
will
come
now
dear
sterling
she
said
aloud
do
cried
sterling
and
a
faint
color
began
to
show
itself
on
her
thin
face
but
not
unless
you
are
quite
sure
that
the
young
people
will
like
it
polly
yes
i
am
sure
said
polly
with
a
decided
nod
of
her
brown
head
then
why
could
you
hold
some
of
your
rehearsals
here
proposed
sterling
should
we
tire
you
asked
polly
no
indeed
declared
sterling
with
sudden
energy
i
could
bear
a
menagerie
up
here
polly
and
she
laughed
outright
gibbons
at
this
unwonted
sound
popped
her
head
in
from
the
adjoining
room
where
she
was
busy
with
her
sewing
to
gaze
in
astonishment
at
her
mistress
i
am
not
surprised
at
your
face
gibbons
said
sterling
cheerily
for
you
have
not
heard
me
laugh
for
many
a
day
no
madam
i
have
said
gibbons
but
i
ca
help
saying
rejoiced
to
hear
it
now
with
a
glance
of
approval
on
polly
pepper
so
polly
you
see
there
is
no
danger
of
your
bringing
me
any
fatigue
and
i
should
be
only
too
happy
to
see
you
at
your
next
rehearsal
we
can
come
i
am
almost
sure
said
polly
those
of
us
who
want
to
rehearse
at
all
some
of
us
you
see
are
quite
sure
of
our
pieces
pickering
dodge
is
for
one
he
spoke
at
his
last
school
exhibition
but
i
tell
the
others
oh
thank
you
for
asking
us
mrs
sterling
thank
you
for
giving
your
time
dear
to
a
dull
old
woman
said
sterling
oh
must
you
go
she
clung
to
her
hand
i
suppose
you
ought
child
yes
said
polly
i
really
ought
to
go
sterling
and
you
are
not
dull
one
single
bit
and
i
like
you
very
much
she
added
as
simply
as
phronsie
would
have
said
it
kiss
me
polly
said
sterling
so
polly
laid
her
fresh
young
cheek
against
the
poor
tired
wasted
one
hopped
into
her
jacket
and
was
off
on
happy
feet
and
the
others
said
yes
when
they
saw
polly
enthusiasm
over
the
plan
of
holding
a
rehearsal
at
sterling
and
jasper
proposed
why
could
we
repeat
the
whole
thing
after
our
grand
performance
for
her
sometime
and
before
any
one
could
quite
tell
how
a
warm
sympathy
had
been
set
in
motion
for
the
rich
lonely
old
lady
in
the
big
gloomy
stone
mansion
most
of
them
passed
daily
on
their
way
to
school
well
the
grand
affair
was
over
now
and
a
greater
success
than
was
ever
hoped
for
now
came
the
enjoyment
of
presenting
the
money
grandpapa
said
polly
we
are
all
here
so
i
perceive
looking
out
on
the
delegation
in
the
hall
for
of
course
all
the
two
clubs
could
go
to
the
presentation
so
committees
were
chosen
to
represent
them
polly
clem
alexia
and
silvia
for
the
salisbury
club
and
jasper
clare
pickering
and
richard
burnett
for

alexia
as
they
all

the
hall

alexia
retorted
joel
who

always
showed
it
by
sparring
with
her
on
every
occasion

pleasure

alexia

jasper

alexia
sweetly

exclaimed
tom
beresford
off
on
the
edge

joel

sister
polly
this
time
said
tom
craning
his
long
neck
to
see
the
contest
oh
alexia
of
course
said
joel
carelessly
she
always
gets
her
in
the
end
but
joel
was
wrong
neither
of
the
girls
carried
off
polly
old
king
marched
out
of
his
come
polly
my
child
you

i
will
walk
together
and
he
waited
on
her
handsomely
out
and
down
the
walk
to
the
car
tom
and
joel
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
in
which
the
others
joined
at
the
crestfallen
faces
well
at
least
you
did
get
her
clem
said
alexia
airily
coming
out
of
her
discomfiture
neither
did
you
said
clem
happily
and
you
are
horrid
boys
to
laugh
said
alexia
looking
over
at
the
two
but
then
all
boys
are
horrid
thank
you
said
tom
with
his
best
bow
alexia
rhys
are
you
perfectly
ashamed
to
be
fighting
with
that
new
boy
cried
clem
come
on
alexia
said
jasper
i
shall
have
to
walk
with
you
to
keep
you
in
order
and
the
gay
procession
hurrying
after
old
king
and
polly
caught
up
with
them
turning
out
of
the
big
stone
gateway
and
then
what
a
merry
walk
they
had
to
the
car
and
that
being
nearly
full
they
had
to
wait
for
the
next
one
which
luckily
had
only
three
passengers
and
king
and
his
party
clambered
on
to
ride
down
through
the
poor
quarters
of
the
town
to
the
corcoran
house
oh
misery
me
exclaimed
alexia
looking
out
at
the
tenements
and
garbage
heaps
up
to
the
very
doors
where
we
going
did
you
suppose
jim
corcoran
lived
in
a
palace
asked
pickering
lazily
well
i
did
suppose
anybody
lived
like
that
said
alexia
wrinkling
up
her
nose
in
scorn
dear
me
look
at
all
those
children
interesting
are
they
said
pickering
with
a
pang
for
the
swarm
of
ragged
dirty
little
creatures
but
not
showing
it
in
the
least
on
his
impassive
face
oh
i
do
want
to
see
it
exclaimed
alexia
and
i
not
going
to
either
turning
her
back
on
it
all
it
goes
on
just
the
same
said
pickering
then
i
am
going
to
look
alexia
whirled
around
again
and
gazed
up
and
down
the
ugly
thoroughfare
taking
it
all
in
ugh
how
can
you
exclaimed
silvia
horne
in
disgust
i
think
very
disagreeable
to
even
know
that
such
people
live
perhaps
be
better
to
kill
off
said
tom
beresford
bluntly
ugh
you
dreadful
boy
cried
clem
forsythe
who
fighting
now
with
the
new
boy
asked
alexia
sweetly
tearing
off
her
gaze
from
the
street
well
who
would
retorted
clem
he
saying
such
perfectly
terrible
things
pickering
dodge
gave
a
short
laugh
beresford
you
in
for
it
now
he
said
tom
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
turned
his
back
on
them
what
did
you
bring
him
home
for
joe
asked
alexia
leaning
over
to
twitch
joel
arm
to
plague
you
alexia
said
joel
with
a
twinkle
in
his
black
eyes
oh
he
does
bother
me
said
alexia
serenely
clem
is
having
all
the
trouble
now
well
we
must
put
up
with
him
i
suppose
she
said
with
resignation
you
do
need
to
said
joel
coolly
you
can
let
us
alone
alexia
but
i
do
want
to
let
you
alone
said
alexia
that
all
boys
are
good
for
if
they
in
a
party
to
keep
stirred
up
goodness
me
king
and
polly
are
getting
out
as
the
car
stopped
and
grandpapa
led
the
way
down
the
aisle
when
they
arrived
at
the
corcoran
house
which
was
achieved
by
dodging
around
groups
of
untidy
women
gossiping
with
their
neighbors
and
children
playing
on
the
dirty
pavements
with
the
occasional
detour
caused
by
a
heap
of
old
tin
cans
and
other
débris
king
drew
a
long
breath
i
do
know
that
i
ought
to
have
brought
you
young
people
down
here
it
did
strike
me
so
badly
before
but
it
no
worse
for
us
to
see
it
than
for
the
people
to
live
here
father
said
jasper
quickly
that
very
true
but
faugh
and
the
old
gentleman
had
great
difficulty
to
contain
himself
well
thank
fortune
the
corcoran
family
are
to
move
this
week
oh
grandpapa
cried
polly
hopping
up
and
down
on
the
broken
pavement
and
oh
father
from
jasper
polly
pepper
exclaimed
alexia
twitching
her
away
you
came
near
stepping
into
that
old
mess
of
bones
and
things
polly
did
even
glance
at
the
garbage
heap
by
the
edge
of
the
sidewalk
nor
give
it
a
thought
oh
how
lovely
alexia
she
cried
that
they
wo
have
but
a
day
or
two
more
here
well
we
are
going
in
said
alexia
holding
her
tightly
and
i
glad
of
it
polly
oh
misery
me
as
they
followed
king
into
the
poor
little
house
that
jim
the
brakeman
had
called
home
the
little
widow
thanks
to
king
and
several
others
interested
in
the
welfare
of
the
brakeman
family
had
smartened
up
considerably
so
that
neither
she
nor
her
dwelling
presented
such
a
dingy
aspect
as
on
the
previous
visit
and
old
king
being
very
glad
to
see
this
still
further
heartened
her
up
by
exclaiming
well
corcoran
you
accomplished
wonders
i
tried
to
cried
the
poor
woman
and
i
sure
was
no
more
than
i
ought
to
do
and
you
being
so
kind
to
me
and
mine
sir
well
i
brought
some
young
people
to
see
you
said
the
old
gentleman
abruptly
who
never
could
bear
to
be
thanked
and
now
felt
much
worse
as
there
were
several
spectators
of
his
bounty
and
he
waved
his
hand
toward
the
representatives
of
the
two
clubs
they
all
huddled
back
but
he
made
them
come
forward
no
it
your
affair
i
only
piloted
you
down
here
laughing
at
their
discomfiture
meanwhile
the
whole
corcoran
brood
had
all
gathered
about
the
visitors
to
rivet
their
gaze
upon
them
and
wait
patiently
for
further
developments
polly
you
tell
her
cried
alexia
yes
polly
do
cried
the
other
girls
yes
polly
said
pickering
you
can
tell
it
the
best
oh
i
never
could
said
polly
in
dismay
jasper
you
please
no
no
polly
said
van
she
the
best
but
polly
does
wish
to
said
jasper
in
a
low
voice
all
right
then
jappy
go
ahead
said
percy
there
was
a
little
pause
corcoran
filling
it
up
by
saying
i
ca
ask
you
to
sit
down
for
there
ai
chairs
enough
beginning
to
wipe
off
one
with
her
apron
here
sir
if
you
please
to
sit
taking
it
over
to
king
thank
you
said
the
old
gentleman
accepting
it
with
his
best
air
now
then
jasper
he
had
handed
a
small
parcel
to
him
under
cover
of
the
go
ahead
my
boy
so
jasper
seeing
that
there
was
no
help
for
it
but
that
he
was
really
to
be
the
spokesman
plunged
in
quite
bravely
corcoran
some
of
us
girls
and
boys
we
belong
to
two
clubs
you
know
waving
his
hand
over
to
the
representatives
wanted
to
show
your
boys
and
girls
that
we
were
grateful
to
their
father
for
being
so
good
and
kind
to
the
passengers
that
night
of
the
accident
here
the
little
widow
put
the
corner
of
her
apron
up
to
her
eye
so
jasper
hurried
on
and
we
wanted
to
help
them
to
get
an
education
and
so
we
had
a
little
entertainment
and
sold
the
tickets
and
here
is
our
gift
jasper
ended
desperately
thrusting
the
package
out
take
it
arethusa
was
all
corcoran
could
say
and
may
the
lord
bless
you
all
then
she
put
the
apron
over
her
head
and
sobbed
aloud
bless
me
exclaimed
old
king
fumbling
for
his
handkerchief
do
my
good
woman
i
beg
of
you
and
oh
i
do
hope
you
learn
to
play
on
the
piano
breathed
polly
as
arethusa
took
the
package
from
jasper
and
slid
back
to
lay
it
in
her
mother
hand
oh
me
i
going
to
cry
exclaimed
alexia
backing
off
toward
the
door
if
you
do
i
throw
you
out
said
joel
savagely
well
i
shall
i
feel
so
sniffly
and
queer
oh
joel
what
shall
i
do
i
shall
be
disgraced
for
life
if
i
cry
here
hang
on
to
me
said
joel
stoutly
thrusting
out
his
sturdy
arm
so
alexia
hung
on
to
it
and
managed
to
get
along
very
well
and
one
of
the
children
the
littlest
one
next
to
the
baby
created
a
diversion
by
bringing
up
a
mangy
cat
and
laying
it
on
king
knees
this
saved
the
situation
as
far
as
crying
went
and
brought
safely
away
those
who
were
perilously
near
the
brink
of
tears
oh
dear
me
exclaimed
polly
starting
forward
knowing
how
grandpapa
detested
cats
but
jasper
was
before
her
let
me
take
it
father
and
he
dexterously
brought
it
off
give
it
to
me
said
polly
oh
what
is
its
name
the
little
thing
who
seemed
to
own
the
cat
toddled
over
well
pleased
and
stuck
his
finger
in
his
mouth
which
was
the
extent
to
which
he
could
go
in
conversation
but
the
other
children
finding
the
ice
now
broken
all
came
up
at
this
point
to
gather
around
polly
and
the
cat
it
lucky
enough
that
phronsie
is
here
said
jasper
in
a
low
voice
for
she
would
never
want
to
leave
that
cat
illustration
and
so
we
had
a
little
entertainment
and
sold
the
tickets
and
here
is
our
gift
just
see
polly
pepper
exclaimed
alexia
with
a
grimace
why
she
drop
that
dirty
old
cat
because
she
ought
not
to
howled
joel
sturdily
then
he
rushed
over
to
polly
and
although
he
had
small
love
for
cats
in
general
this
particular
one
being
extremely
and
lean
met
with
his
favor
he
stroked
her
poor
back
arethusa
drew
near
and
gazed
into
polly
face
seeing
which
the
cat
was
safely
transferred
to
joel
and
polly
turned
around
to
the
girl
oh
do
you
want
to
learn
to
play
on
the
piano
asked
polly
breathlessly
under
cover
of
the
noise
going
on
for
all
the
other
members
of
the
two
clubs
now
took
a
hand
in
it
even
percy
unbent
enough
to
interview
one
of
the
corcoran
boys
yes
i
do
said
arethusa
clasping
her
small
red
hands
tightly
her
eyes
widened
and
her
little
thin
face
which
was
a
bit
pretty
lightened
up
now
in
a
way
that
polly
thought
was
perfectly
beautiful
well
i
did
when
i
was
a
little
girl
like
you
polly
bent
her
rosy
face
very
close
to
arethusa
oh
and
i
used
to
drum
on
the
table
to
make
believe
i
could
play
so
do
i
cried
arethusa
creeping
up
close
to
polly
neck
an
boys
laugh
at
me
but
i
keep
doin
it
and
now
arethusa
you
are
really
going
to
learn
to
play
on
the
piano
polly
thrilled
all
over
at
the
announcement
just
as
she
had
done
when
told
that
she
was
to
take
music
lessons
not
a
really
and
truly
piano
exclaimed
arethusa
lost
in
amazement
yes
a
really
and
truly
piano
declared
polly
positively
just
think
arethusa
you
can
give
music
lessons
and
help
to
take
care
of
your
mother
and
just
then
grandpapa
who
had
been
talking
to
corcoran
was
saying
well
well
it
time
to
be
going
young
people
and
joel
put
the
cat
down
that
immediately
ran
between
his
legs
tripping
him
up
as
he
turned
thereby
making
everybody
laugh
and
so
the
exit
was
made
merrily
was
that
fun
cried
alexia
dancing
off
down
the
broken
pavement
oh
i
forgot
i
going
to
walk
home
with
polly
and
she
flew
back
you
take
yourself
away
cried
old
king
with
a
laugh
i
to
have
polly
to
myself
on
this
expedition
well
at
any
rate
clem
you
have
polly
announced
alexia
as
before
running
up
to
her
neither
have
you
retorted
clem
in
the
same
way
so

will
walk
together
said
alexia
coolly
possessing
herself
of
clem
arm
those
two
boys
can
walk
with
each
other
they
just
dying
to
how
do
you
know
i
want
to
walk
with
you
asked
clem
abruptly
oh
but
do
you
sweet
thing
you
come
on
and
alexia
dragged
her
off
at
a
smart
pace
grandpapa
cried
polly
hopping
up
and
down
by
his
side
too
happy
to
keep
still
while
she
clung
to
his
hand
just
as
phronsie
would
have
done
you
are
going
to
have
the
piano
put
into
the
house
the
very
first
thing
after
it
is
cleaned
and
ready
the
first
thing
she
peered
around
into
his
face
anxiously
the
first
thing
declared
the
old
gentleman
take
my
word
for
it
polly
pepper
there
another
article

in
before

grandpapa
polly
wished
she
could
go
dancing
off
into
the
middle
of
the
thoroughfare
for
a
regular
spin
take
care
polly
laughed
old
king
successfully
steering
her
clear
of
an
ash
barrel
this
is
the
best
dancing
place
imaginable
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
grandpapa
said
polly
trying
to
sober
down

did
mean
to
but
oh
is
it
perfectly
beautiful
that
arethusa
is
going
to
take
music
lessons
it
is
indeed
said
grandpapa
with
a
keen
glance
down
at
her
flushed
face
and
it
really
does
seem
to
be
an
assured
fact
for
miss
brown
is
engaged
to
begin
as
soon
as
the
family
move
into
their
new
home
oh
oh
polly

longingly

polly
that
jasper

walk
home
with

i
polly
said
the
old
gentleman
but
you
see
he
ca
for
then
i
should
have
the
whole
bunch
of
those
chattering
creatures
around
me
and
he
laughed

all
about
what
we
are
talking
of
as
soon
as

get
home
yes

the
old
gentleman

glowed
with
pride

in
a
burst

chuckled
king
well

a
time

and

because
you

a
lot
of

those
whitney
boys

scare
you
to
death
sometimes
polly
burst
into
such
a
merry
peal
of
laughter
that
they
neither
of
them
heard
the
rushing
feet
until
cathie
glanced
up
oh
dear
me
there
they
are
now
well
to
be
sure
we
might
have
known
you

here
polly
cried
jasper
dashing
up
with
clare
how
do
you
do
cathie
putting
out
his
hand
cordially
clare
gave
her
a
careless
nod
then
turned
to
polly
it
to
be
fine
he
said
what
asked
polly
wonderingly
hold
on
old
chap
jasper
gave
him
a
clap
on
the
back

cried
over
her
shoulder

that
so
said
jasper
clare
we
must
beat
them
and
they
dashed
in
pursuit
but
they
could
the
two
girls
flew
over
the
lawn
and
reached
the
stone
steps
just
a
breathing
space
before
jasper
and
clare
plunged
up
well
done
cried
jasper
tossing
back
the
hair
from
his
forehead
i
did
know
you
could
run
so
well
observed
clare
with
some
show
of
interest

cathie

polly
with
sparkling
eyes
let

a
race
sometime
jasper
we
four
down
the
long
path
while

jasper
but
now
for
father
room
there
sat
old
king
by
his
writing
table
well
polly
how
do
you
do
cathie
i
am
glad
to
see
you
he
said
putting
out
his
hand
kindly
as
well
as
she
could
for
her
terror
at
being
actually
in
that
stately
king
presence
cathie
stumbled
forward
and
laid
her
hand
in
his
now
polly
said
the
old
gentleman
turning
off
to
pick
up
a
little
envelope
lying
on
the
table
i
thought
perhaps
you
would
like
to
take
your
young
friend
to
the
play
so
i
have
the
tickets
for
us
five
with
a
sweep
of
his
hand
over
to
the
two
boys
grandpapa
cried
polly
precipitating
herself
into
his
arms
oh
how
good
you
are
which
pleased
the
old
gentleman
immensely

that
fine
cried
jasper
in
delight
father
we
thank

my
boy
cried
the
old
gentleman
i
thanked
enough
and
so
polly
my
girl
you
like
it
patting
her
brown
hair
like
it
cried
polly
lifting
her
glowing
cheeks
oh
grandpapa

along
with
you
then
all
of
you
clare
be
over
in
time
yes
sir
cried
clare
oh
thank
you
king
ever
so
much
as
they
all
scampered
off
to
get
their
lessons
for
the
next
day
for
going
to
a
play
was
always
a
special
treat
on
condition
that
no
studies
were
neglected
oh
cathie
cried
polly
before
she
flew
into
the
to
curl
up
with
her
books
her
favorite
place
for
studying
her
lessons
grandpapa
is
taking
us
to
the
play
because
you
are
here
and
i
never
been
to
a
play
polly
said
cathie
perfectly
overwhelmed
with
it
all
have
you
oh
i
so
glad
i
mean
i
glad
you
going
with
us
and
that
grandpapa
is
to
take
you
to
the
first
one
but
oh
me
and
polly
rushed
off
to
attack
her
books
now
do
let
us
speak
a
single
word
cathie
harrison
as
cathie
picked
out
a
low
rocker
for
her
choice
of
a
seat
and
pretty
soon
if
miss
salisbury
herself
had
come
into
the
room
she
would
have
been
perfectly
satisfied
with
the
diligent
attention
the
books
were
receiving
but
miss
salisbury
was
not
thinking
of
her
pupils
this
afternoon
she
was
at
this
moment
closeted
with
miss
anstice
and
going
over
a
conversation
that
they
frequently
held
these
past
days
without
much
variation
in
the
subject
or
treatment
if
there
were
anything
we
could
do
to
repay
him
sister
said
miss
anstice
mournfully
i
do
it
and
spend
my
last
cent
but
what
is
there
then
she
paced
the
floor
with
her
mincing
little
steps
now
quite
nervous
and
flurried
sister
said
miss
salisbury
doing
her
best
to
be
quite
calm
it
is
a
matter
of
payment
for
whatever
we
did
we
never
could
hope
to
replace
that
exquisite
little
vase
miss
clemcy
had
pointed
out
to
me
the
fact
that
it
was
quite
the
gem
in
his
collection
i
know
i
thought
my
heart
would
stop
when
i
heard
the
crash
miss
anstice
wrung
her
little
hands
together
at
the
memory
oh
that
careless
lily
sister
pray
let
us
look
at
this
matter
i
am
looking
at
it
i
see
nothing
but
that
vase
smashed
to
pieces
and
i
can
not
sleep
at
night
for
fear
i
dream
how
it
looked
in
those
very
little
bits
sister
pray
pray
and
if
you
want
me
to
tell
you
what
i
think
should
be
done
i
sure
i
ca
say
added
miss
anstice
helplessly
well
then
i
must
think
declared
miss
salisbury
with
sudden
energy
for
some
repayment
must
surely
be
made
to
him
although
they
utterly
refused
it
when
you
and
i
called
and
broached
the
subject
to
them
it
was
certainly
a
most
unfortunate
day
from
beginning
to
end
said
miss
anstice
with
a
suggestion
of
tears
in
her
voice
and
a
shiver
at
the
remembrance
of
the
front
breadth
of
her
gown
sister
i
hope
and
pray
that
you
will
never
have
another
picnic
for
the
school
i
can
not
abolish
that
annual
custom
anstice
said
miss
salisbury
firmly
for
the
girls
get
so
much
enjoyment
out
of
it
they
are
already
talking
about
the
one
to
come
next
year
ugh
shuddered
miss
anstice
and
anything
that
holds
an
influence
over
them
i
must
sustain
you
know
that
yourself
sister
and
it
is
most
important
to
give
them
some
recreations
but
miss
anstice
held
up
her
little
hands
as
if
quite
unequal
to
any
words
and
i
am
very
sorry
that
we
were
out
when
clemcy
and
his
sister
called
yesterday
afternoon
for
i
am
quite
sure
i
could
have
arranged
matters
so
that
we
need
not
feel
under
obligations
to
them
miss
anstice
having
nothing
to
say
kept
her
private
reflections
mournfully
to
herself
and
it
being
the
hour
for
the
boarding
pupils
to
go
out
to
walk
and
her
duty
to
accompany
them
the
conference
broke
up
polly
called
chatterton
as
polly
ran
past
her
door
her
opera
glasses
grandpapa
had
given
her
last
christmas
in
the
little
plush
bag
dangling
from
her
arm
and
a
happy
light
in
her
eyes
cathie
had
gone
downstairs
and
it
was
getting
nearly
time
to
set
forth
for
that
enchanted
land
the
playhouse
polly
ran
on
scarcely
conscious
that
she
was
called
did
you
not
hear
me
asked
chatterton
angrily
coming
to
her
door
oh
i
beg
pardon
said
polly
really
glad
ever
since
that
dreadful
time
when
chatterton
was
ill
to
do
anything
for
her
for
i
never
shall
forget
how
naughty
i
was
to
her
polly
said
over
to
herself
now
as
she
turned
back
you
may
well
beg
my
pardon
said
chatterton
for
of
all
girls
you
are
certainly
the
worst
i
want
you
then
she
disappeared
within
her
room
what
is
it
asked
polly
coming
in
i
shall
be
so
glad
to
help
help
repeated
chatterton
in
scorn
she
was
standing
over
by
her
toilet
table
you
can
serve
me
come
here
the
hot
blood
mounted
to
polly
brow
then
she
thought
oh
what
did
i
say
that
i
would
do
anything
for
chatterton
if
she
would
only
forgive
me
for
those
dreadful
words
i
said
to
her
and
she
went
over
and
stood
by
the
toilet
table
oh
you
have
concluded
to
come
observed
chatterton
scornfully
so
much
the
better
it
would
be
if
you
could
always
learn
what
your
place
is
in
this
house
there
you
see
this
lace
she
shook
out
her
flowing
sleeve
glad
to
display
her
still
finely
moulded
arm
that
had
been
one
of
her
chief
claims
to
distinction
even
if
nobody
but
this
little
girl
saw
it
polly
looked
at
the
dangling
lace
evidently
just
torn
with
dismay
seeing
which
chatterton
broke
out
sharply
get
the
basket
girl
over
there
on
the
table
and
sew
it
as
well
as
you
can
polly
called
jasper
over
the
stairs
where
are
you
polly
trembled
all
over
as
she
hurried
across
the
room
to
get
the
sewing
basket
grandpapa
was
not
ready
she
knew
but
she
always
ran
down
a
little
ahead
for
the
fun
of
the
last
moments
waiting
with
jasper
when
old
king
was
going
to
take
them
out
of
an
evening
and
in
the
turmoil
in
her
mind
she
did
observe
that
hortense
had
misplaced
the
basket
putting
it
on
the
low
bookcase
and
was
still
searching
all
over
the
table
as
directed
when
chatterton
sharp
voice
filled
her
with
greater
dismay
if
you
would
put
heart
into
your
search
it
would
be
easy
enough
to
find
it
where
you
polly
in
her
haste
not
to
displease
chatterton
by
replying
to
jasper
before
finding
the
basket
knocked
over
one
of
the
small
bottles
with
which
the
dressing
table
seemed
to
be
full
and
before
she
could
rescue
it
it
fell
to
the
floor
go
out
of
this
room
commanded
chatterton
with
blazing
eyes
i
ought
to
have
known
better
than
to
call
upon
a
country
girl
to
do
a
delicate
service
i
did
mean
began
poor
polly
go
out
of
this
room
chatterton
now
thoroughly
out
of
temper
so
far
forgot
herself
as
to
stamp
her
foot
and
polly
feeling
as
if
she
had
lost
all
chance
in
her
future
encounters
with
chatterton
of
atoning
for
past
went
sadly
out
to
meet
just
beside
the
door
jasper
with
amazement
on
his
face
oh
polly
i
thought
you
were
never
coming
then
he
saw
her
face
that
old
he
said
under
his
breath
polly
do
ever
go
into
her
room
again
i
would
as
they
hurried
off
downstairs
she
wo
let
me
said
polly
her
head
drooping
and
the
brightness
all
gone
from
her
face
she
wo
ever
let
me
go
again
i
know
wo
let
you
well
i
guess
you
not
give
her
a
chance
cried
jasper
hotly
polly
i
do
really
wish
that
father
would
tell
her
to
go
away
oh
jasper
cried
polly
in
alarm
do
say
one
word
to
grandpapa
promise
me
you
wo
jasper
well
father
is
tired
of
her
she
wears
on
him
terribly
polly
said
jasper
gloomily
i
know
said
polly
sadly
and
oh
jasper
if
you
say
one
word
he
will
really
have
her
go
and
i
was
so
bad
to
her
you
know
and
the
tears
came
into
polly
brown
eyes
well
she
must
have
been
perfectly
terrible
to
you
said
jasper
polly
jasper
where
are
you
came
in
old
king
voice
here
father
and
here
grandpapa
and
clare
running
up
the
steps
the
little
party
was
soon
in
the
carriage
promise
me
jasper
do
implored
polly
when
grandpapa
was
explaining
to
cathie
about
the
great
actor
they
were
to
see
and
clare
was
listening
to
hear
all
about
it
too
oh
i
wo
promised
jasper
if
you
do
wish
me
to
i
really
would
have
you
for
all
the
world
declared
polly
and
now
that
this
fear
was
off
from
her
mind
she
began
to
pick
up
her
old
bright
spirits
so
that
by
the
time
the
carriage
stopped
at
the
theatre
polly
was
herself
again
jasper
watched
her
keenly
and
drew
a
long
breath
when
he
saw
her
talking
and
laughing
with
grandpapa
you
are
going
to
sit
next
to
me
polly
said
the
old
gentleman
marshalling
his
forces
when
well
within
and
jasper
next
then
cathie
you
will
have
a
knight
on
either
side
oh
i
ca
sit
between
two
boys
cried
cathie
forgetting
herself
in
her
terror
i
wo
bite
you
cried
clare
saucily
i
will
see
that
clare
behaves
himself
said
jasper
you
do
nicely
my
dear
said
king
encouragingly
to
her
then
proceeded
down
the
aisle
after
the
usher
so
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
obey
and
cathie
who
would
have
found
it
a
formidable
thing
to
be
stranded
on
the
companionship
of
one
boy
found
herself
between
two
and
polly
pepper
far
off
and
not
the
least
able
to
help
now
then
said
jasper
taking
up
the
program
i
suppose
father
told
you
pretty
much
all
that
was
necessary
to
know
about
irving
well
and
then
without
waiting
for
a
reply
jasper
dashed
on
about
the
splendid
plays
in
which
he
had
seen
this
wonderful
actor
and
the
particular
one
they
were
to
enjoy
and
from
that
he
drifted
off
to
the
fine
points
to
be
admired
in
the
big
playhouse
with
its
striking
decorations
making
cathie
raise
her
eyes
to
take
it
all
in
until
clare
leaned
over
to
say
i
should
think
you
might
give
cathie
and
me
a
chance
to
talk
a
little
jasper
oh
i
do
want
to
talk
cried
cathie
in
terror
i
do
know
anything
to
say
well
i
do
said
clare
in
a
dudgeon
only
jasper
goes
on
in
such
a
streak
i
believe
i
have
been
talking
you
both
blue
said
jasper
with
a
laugh
you
certainly
have
said
clare
laughing
too
and
then
cathie
laughed
and
polly
pepper
looking
over
beamed
at
her
for
she
had
begun
to
be
worried
the
best
thing
in
the
world
said
old
king
was
to
turn
her
over
to
those
two
boys
now
do
give
her
another
thought
polly
get
on
and
she
did
so
well
that
before
long
she
and
clare
were
chatting
away
merrily
and
cathie
felt
it
was
by
no
means
such
a
very
terrible
experience
to
be
sitting
between
two
boys
at
a
play
and
by
the
time
the
evening
was
half
over
she
was
sure
that
she
liked
it
very
much
and
polly
beamed
at
her
more
than
ever
and
jasper
felt
quite
sure
that
he
had
never
enjoyed
an
evening
more
than
the
one
at
present
flying
by
so
fast
and
old
king
so
handsome
and
stately
showed
such
evident
pride
in
his
young
charges
as
he
smiled
and
chatted
that
more
than
one
old
friend
in
the
audience
commented
on
it
did
you
ever
see
such
a
change
in
any
one
asked
a
dowager
levelling
her
keen
glances
from
her
box
down
upon
the
merry
party
never
it
was
the
one
thing
needed
to
make
him
quite
perfect
said
another
one
of
that
set
he
is
approachable
now
absolutely
fascinating
so
genial
and
courteous
his
manners
were
perfect
before
said
a
third
member
of
the
box
party
except
they
needed
thawing
out
a
bit
too
icy
you
are
too
mild
i
should
say
they
were
quite
frozen
he
never
seemed
to
me
to
have
any
heart
well
it
proved
he
has
observed
her
husband
i
tell
you
that
little
pepper
girl
is
going
to
make
a
sensation
when
she
comes
out
leaning
over
for
a
better
view
of
the
king
party
and
the
best
of
it
is
that
she
does
know
it
herself
and
clare
made
up
his
mind
that
cathie
harrison
was
an
awfully
nice
girl
and
he
was
real
glad
she
had
moved
to
town
and
joined
the
salisbury
school
and
as
he
had
two
cousins
there
they
soon
waked
up
a
conversation
over
them
only
i
do
know
them
much
said
cathie
you
see
i
have
been
at
the
school
long
and
besides
the
girls
did
have
much
to
say
to
me
till
polly
pepper
said
nice
things
to
me
and
then
she
asked
me
to
go
to
the
bee
that
old
sewing
thing
where
they
make
clothes
for
the
poor
little
darkeys
down
south
asked
clare
yes
and
it
just
lovely
said
cathie
and
i
never
supposed
i
be
asked
and
polly
pepper
came
down
to
my
desk
one
day
and
invited
me
to
come
to
the
next
meeting
and
i
was
so
scared
i
could
say
anything
at
first
and
then
polly
got
me
into
the
salisbury
club
oh
yes
i
know
clare
nodded
and
wished
he
could
forget
how
he
had
asked
one
of
the
other
boys
on
that
evening
when
the
two
clubs
united
why
in
the
world
the
salisbury
club
elected
cathie
harrison
into
its
membership
and
then
polly
pepper
mother
invited
me
to
visit
her
polly
i
mean
and
so
here
i
am
she
forgot
she
was
talking
to
a
dreaded
boy
and
turned
her
happy
face
toward
him
and
it
just
lovely
i
never
visited
a
girl
before
never
visited
a
girl
before
repeated
clare
in
astonishment
no
said
cathie
you
see
my
father
was
a
minister
and
we
lived
in
the
country
and
when
i
visited
anybody
which
was
only
two
or
three
times
in
my
life
it
was
to
papa
old
aunts
oh
dear
me
exclaimed
clare
faintly
quite
gone
in
pity
and
so
your
father
moved
to
town
he
said
and
then
he
knew
that
he
had
made
a
terrible
mistake
now
she
wo
speak
a
word
perhaps
burst
out
crying
he
groaned
within
himself
as
he
saw
her
face
but
cathie
sat
quite
still
my
papa
died
she
said
softly
and
he
told
mamma
before
he
went
to
take
me
to
town
and
have
me
educated
and
one
of
those
old
aunts
gave
the
money
and
if
it
had
been
for
him
i
have
run
home
from
the
salisbury
school
that
first
week
it
was
so
perfectly
awful
clare
sat
quite
still
then
he
burst
out
well
now
cathie
i
think
it
was
just
splendid
in
you
to
stick
on
do
you
she
cried
quite
astonished
to
think
any
one
would
think
she
was
just
splendid
in
anything
why
the
girls
call
me
a
goose
over
and
over
and
sometimes
i
lose
my
temper
because
they
do
say
it
in
fun
but
they
really
mean
it
well
they
need
said
clare
indignantly
because
i
do
think
you
are
a
goose
at
all
those
two
are
getting
on
quite
well
said
jasper
to
polly
i
think
we
need
to
worry
about
cathie
any
more
and
is
she
nice
asked
polly
in
great
delight
yes
i
think
she
is
polly
said
jasper
in
a
way
that
gave
polly
great
satisfaction
but
when
this
delightful
evening
was
all
over
and
the
good
nights
had
been
said
and
mother
fisher
as
was
her
wont
had
come
into
room
to
help
her
take
off
her
things
and
to
say
a
few
words
to
cathie
too
polly
began
to
remember
the
scene
in
chatterton
room
and
a
sorry
little
feeling
crept
into
her
heart
and
when
mamsie
had
gone
out
and
everything
was
quiet
polly
buried
her
face
in
her
pillow
and
tried
not
to
cry
i
do
believe
she
will
ever
forgive
me
or
let
me
help
her
again
polly
called
cathie
softly
from
the
next
room
i
did
have
the
most
beautiful
time
did
you
cried
polly
choking
back
her
sobs
oh
i
am
so
glad
cathie
yes
said
cathie
i
did
polly
and
i
not
afraid
of
boys
now
i
think
they
are
real
nice
are
they
cried
polly
and
were
our
seats
fine
grandpapa
did
want
a
box
because
we
could
see
the
play
so
much
better
from
the
floor
but
we
ought
to
go
to
sleep
cathie
for
mamsie
like
us
to
talk
good
night
good
night
said
cathie
a
box
she
said
to
herself
as
she
turned
on
her
pillow
oh
i
should
have
died
to
have
sat
up
in
one
of
those
it
was
quite
magnificent
enough
where
i
was
xxii
pickering
dodge
jasper
jasper
rushing
down
the
long
hall
of
the
pemberton
school
books
in
hand
turned
to
see
faber
standing
in
the
doorway
of
his
private
room
i
want
to
see
you
jasper
jasper
with
an
awful
feeling
at
his
heart
obeyed
and
went
in
all
up
with
pick
he
groaned
and
sat
down
in
the
place
indicated
on
the
other
side
of
the
big
round
table
faber
in
his
accustomed
seat
the
big
leather
chair
you
remember
the
conversation
i
had
with
you
jasper
he
said
slowly
and
picking
up
a
paper
knife
he
began
playing
with
it
occasionally
glancing
up
over
his
glasses
at
the
boy
jasper
nodded
unable
to
find
any
voice
then
he
managed
to
say
yes
sir
well
now
jasper
it
was
rather
an
unusual
thing
to
do
to
set
one
lad
as
it
were
to
work
upon
another
in
just
that
way
for
i
am
sure
i
have
forgotten
my
boyhood
long
past
as
it
is
and
i
realize
that
the
responsibilities
of
school
life
are
heavy
enough
without
adding
to
the
burden
faber
well
pleased
with
this
sentiment
waited
to
clear
his
throat
jasper
in
an
agony
as
he
saw
pickering
dodge
expelled
and
all
the
dreadful
consequences
sat
quite
still
at
the
same
time
although
i
disliked
to
take
you
into
confidence
making
you
an
assistant
in
the
work
of
reclaiming
pickering
dodge
from
his
idle
aimless
state
in
which
he
exhibited
such
a
total
disregard
for
his
lessons
it
appeared
after
due
consideration
to
be
the
only
thing
left
to
be
done
you
understand
this
i
trust
jasper
jasper
reply
this
time
was
so
low
as
to
be
scarcely
audible
but
faber
taking
it
for
granted
manipulated
the
paper
knife
a
few
times
and
went
on
impressively
i
am
very
glad
you
do
jasper
i
felt
sure
knowing
you
so
well
that
my
reasons
would
appeal
to
you
in
the
right
way
you
are
best
friend
among
my
scholars
and
he
is
mine
exploded
jasper
thinking
wildly
that
it
was
perhaps
not
quite
too
late
to
save
pickering
i
known
him
always
sir
he
was
quite
to
the
edge
of
his
chair
now
his
dark
eyes
shining
and
his
hair
tossed
back
beg
pardon
faber
but
i
ca
help
it
pickering
is
so
fine
he
not
like
other
boys
no
i
believe
you
faber
smiled
grimly
and
gave
the
paper
knife
another
whirl
and
much
as
jasper
liked
him
that
smile
seemed
wholly
unnecessary
and
to
deal
death
to
his
hopes
he
certainly
is
unlike
any
other
boy
in
my
school
in
regard
to
his
studying
he
said
his
capacity
is
not
wanting
to
be
sure
there
was
never
any
lack
of
that
for
that
reason
i
was
always
hoping
to
arouse
his
ambition
and
you
can
oh
you
can
sir
cried
jasper
eagerly
although
he
felt
every
word
he
said
to
be
unwelcome
if
you
will
only
try
him
a
bit
longer
do
send
him
off
yet
mr
faber
he
got
off
from
his
chair
and
leaned
on
the
table
heavily
do
send
him
off
repeated
faber
dropping
the
paper
knife
what
is
the
boy
talking
of
why
jasper
i
called
you
in
here
to
tell
you
how
much
pickering
has
improved
and
jasper
collapsed
on
his
chair
and
is
it
possible
that
you
seen
it
for
yourself
jasper
exclaimed
faber
why
every
teacher
is
quite
delighted
even
dinsmore
and
he
was
in
favor
of
at
least
suspending
pickering
last
half
has
expressed
his
opinion
that
i
did
well
to
give
the
boy
another
trial
i
thought
mumbled
jasper
i
was
afraid
then
he
pulled
himself
together
and
somehow
found
himself
standing
over
by
faber
chair
unbosoming
himself
of
his
fright
and
corresponding
joy
pull
your
chair
up
nearer
jasper
said
faber
when
the
first
transport
having
worked
off
jasper
seemed
better
fitted
for
conversation
and
we
will
go
over
this
in
a
more
intelligent
fashion
i
am
really
more
pleased
than
i
can
express
at
the
improvement
in
that
boy
as
i
said
before
faber
had
long
ago
thrown
aside
the
paper
knife
and
now
turned
toward
jasper
his
whole
attention
on
the
matter
in
hand
pickering
has
a
fine
capacity
take
it
all
in
all
perhaps
there
is
none
better
in
the
whole
school
it
shows
to
great
advantage
now
because
he
has
regained
his
place
so
rapidly
in
his
classes
it
is
quite
astonishing
jasper
and
he
took
off
his
glasses
and
polished
them
up
carefully
repeating
several
times
during
the
process
yes
very
surprising
indeed
and
he
seems
to
like
to
study
now
said
jasper
ready
to
bring
forward
all
the
nice
things
that
warranted
encouragement
does
he
so
faber
set
his
glasses
on
his
nose
and
beamed
at
him
over
them
the
boys
at
the
pemberton
school
always
protested
that
this
was
the
only
use
they
could
be
put
to
on
the
master
countenance
well
now
jasper
i
really
believe
i
am
justified
in
entertaining
a
very
strong
hope
of
pickering
future
career
and
i
see
no
reason
why
he
should
not
be
ready
for
college
with
you
and
without
conditions
if
he
will
only
keep
his
ambition
alive
and
active
now
it
is
aroused
may
i
tell
him
so
cried
jasper
almost
beside
himself
with
joy
oh
may
i
mr
faber
why
that
is
what
i
called
you
in
here
for
jasper
said
the
master
it
seemed
so
very
much
better
for
him
to
hear
it
from
a
boy
for
i
remember
my
own
boyhood
though
so
very
long
since
and
the
effect
will
i
feel
sure
be
much
deeper
than
if
pickering
hears
it
from
me
he
is
very
tired
of
this
study
jasper
and
faber
glanced
around
at
the
four
walls
and
again
came
that
grim
smile
and
even
to
hear
a
word
of
commendation
it
might
not
be
so
pleasing
to
be
called
in
so
away
with
you
at
the
proper
time
i
shall
speak
to
him
myself
jasper
needing
no
second
bidding
fled
precipitately
dashed
in
again
beg
pardon
i
forgotten
my
books
he
seized
them
from
the
table
and
made
quick
time
tracking
pickering
where
is
pick
rushing
up
to
a
knot
of
boys
on
a
corner
of
the
playground
just
separating
to
go
home
do
know
what
up
king
ca
stop
said
jasper
flying
back
to
the
schoolroom
i
must
get
pick
dodge
has
gone
shouted
a
boy
clearing
the
steps
who
had
heard
the
last
words
so
jasper
turning
again
left
school
and
playground
far
behind
to
run
up
the
steps
of
the
cabot
mansion
pickering
here
yes
the
butler
had
seen
him
hurrying
over
the
stairs
to
his
own
room
just
five
minutes
ago
and
in
less
than
a
minute
jasper
was
up
in
that
same
place
there
sat
pickering
by
his
table
his
long
legs
upon
its
surface
and
his
hands
thrust
into
his
pockets
his
books
sprawled
just
where
he
had
thrown
them
at
different
angles
along
the
floor
hullo
cried
jasper
flying
in
to
stop
aghast
at
this
yes
you
see
jasper
i
played
out
said
pickering
it
is
any
use
for
me
to
study
and
there
are
the
plaguey
things
pulling
out
one
set
of
fingers
to
point
to
the
sprawling
books
i
ca
catch
up
every
teacher
looks
at
me
as
if
i
were
a
hopeless
case
which
i
am
oh
you
big
dunce
jasper
clapped
his
books
on
the
table
with
a
bang
making
pickering
draw
down
his
long
legs
rushed
around
to
precipitate
himself
on
the
rest
of
the
figure
in
the
chair
when
he
pommelled
him
to
his
heart
content
if
you
expect
to
beat
any
hope
into
me
old
boy
cried
pickering
not
caring
in
the
least
for
the
onslaught
you
miss
your
guess
i
hoping
to
beat
sense
into
you
cried
jasper
pounding
away
though
it
looks
almost
impossible
now
he
declared
laughing
pick
you
won
faber
says
you
come
up
in
classes
splendidly
and
pickering
sprang
to
his
feet
what
do
you
mean
jasper
he
cried
hoarsely
his
face
white
as
a
sheet
just
what
i
say
say
it
again
so
jasper
went
all
over
it
once
more
adding
the
other
things
about
getting
into
college
and
all
that
as
much
as
pickering
would
hear
honest
he
broke
in
his
pale
face
getting
a
dull
red
and
seizing
jasper
by
the
shoulders
did
i
ever
tell
you
anything
that
was
so
pick
no
but
i
ca
believe
it
jap
it
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
i
and
what
incessant
blame
could
not
do
praise
achieved
pickering
rushed
to
the
bed
flung
himself
face
down
upon
it
and
broke
into
a
torrent
of
sobs
jasper
who
had
never
seen
pickering
cry
had
wild
thoughts
of
rushing
for
cabot
the
uncle
was
not
at
home
but
remembering
how
little
good
this
could
possibly
do
he
bent
all
his
energies
to
stop
this
flood
but
he
was
helpless
having
never
given
way
in
this
manner
before
pickering
seemed
determined
to
make
a
thorough
job
of
it
and
it
was
not
till
he
was
quite
exhausted
that
he
rolled
over
wiped
his
eyes
and
looked
at
jasper
i
through
he
announced
i
should
think
you
might
well
be
retorted
jasper
what
with
scaring
me
almost
to
death
you
made
yourself
a
fright
pick
and
you
just
upset
all
your
chances
to
study
pickering
flung
himself
off
the
bed
as
summarily
as
he
had
gone
on
that
likely
is
it
he
cried
mockingly
and
shamefacedly
scrabbling
up
the
books
from
the
floor
now
then
and
he
was
across
the
room
pouring
out
a
basinful
of
water
to
thrust
his
swollen
face
within
it
whew
i
never
knew
it
used
a
chap
up
so
to
cry
he
spluttered
goodness
me
he
withdrew
his
countenance
from
the
towel
to
regard
jasper
how
you
look
cried
jasper
considering
it
better
to
rail
at
him
whereupon
pickering
found
his
way
to
the
long
mirror
i
never
was
a
beauty
he
said
and
now
you
are
less
laughed
jasper
but
i
good
said
pickering
solemnly
and
flinging
himself
down
to
his
books
you
ca
study
with
such
eyes
cried
jasper
tugging
at
the
book
clear
out
i
not
going
pick
your
eyes
are
much
bigger
than
pins
but
they
sharp
just
as
pins
are
leave
me
alone
pickering
squirmed
all
over
his
chair
but
jasper
had
the
book
never
mind
i
fly
at
my
history
then
said
pickering
possessing
himself
of
another
book
that
the
beauty
of
it
i
as
backward
in
all
of
my
lessons
as
i
am
in
one
i
can
strike
in
anywhere
you
are
not
backward
in
any
now
cried
jasper
in
glee
and
performing
an
indian
war
dance
around
the
table
forward
is
the
word
henceforth
he
brought
up
dramatically
with
another
lunge
at
pickering
get
out
you
better
go
home
i
have
the
smallest
intention
of
going
replied
jasper
and
successfully
coming
off
with
a
second
book
here
for
book
number
three
declared
pickering
but
too
late
jasper
seized
the
remaining
two
tossed
them
back
of
him
then
squared
off
come
on
for
a
tussle
old
fellow
you
not
fit
to
study
ruin
your
eyes
come
on
his
whole
face
sparkling
it
was
too
much
the
table
was
pushed
one
side
books
and
lessons
faber
and
college
were
as
things
never
heard
of
and
for
a
good
quarter
of
an
hour
pickering
whose
hours
of
exercise
had
been
much
scantier
of
late
was
hard
pushed
to
parry
all
jasper
attacks
at
the
last
when
the
little
clock
on
the
mantel
struck
four
he
came
out
ahead
i
declare
that
was
a
good
one
he
exclaimed
in
a
glow
particularly
so
to
you
said
jasper
ruefully
you
gave
me
a
regular
you
scamp
had
to
to
pay
you
up
and
now
you
may
study
cried
jasper
gaily
and
snatching
his
books
he
ran
off
oh
pick
putting
his
head
in
at
the
door
yes
if
the
lessons
are
done
come
over
this
evening
will
you
all
right
the
last
sound
of
jasper
feet
on
the
stairs
reached
pickering
when
he
suddenly
left
his
chair
and
flew
into
the
hall
jap
oh
i
say
jap
then
he
plunged
back
into
his
room
to
thrust
his
head
out
of
the
window
jap
he
howled
to
the
consternation
of
a
fat
old
gentleman
passing
beneath
who
on
account
of
his
size
finding
it
somewhat
inconvenient
to
look
up
therefore
waddled
into
the
street
and
surveyed
the
house
gravely
pickering
slammed
down
the
window
leaving
the
old
gentleman
to
stare
as
long
as
he
saw
fit
i
ca
go
over
there
looking
like
this
he
pranced
up
to
the
mirror
again
fuming
every
step
of
the
way
and
surveyed
himself
in
dismay
there
was
some
improvement
in
the
appearance
of
his
countenance
to
be
sure
but
not
by
any
means
enough
to
please
him
his
pale
blue
eyes
were
so
small
and
their
surroundings
so
swollen
that
they
reminded
him
of
nothing
so
much
as
those
of
a
small
pig
he
had
made
acquaintance
with
in
a
visit
up
in
the
country
while
his
nose
long
and
usually
quite
had
resigned
all
claims
to
distinction
and
was
hopelessly
pudgy
jasper
knows
i
ca
go
in
this
shape
he
cried
in
a
fury
great
cæsar
ghost
i
never
supposed
it
banged
a
fellow
up
so
to
cry
just
once
and
the
next
moments
were
spent
in
sopping
his
face
violently
with
the
wet
towel
which
did
no
good
as
it
had
been
plentifully
supplied
with
that
treatment
before
at
last
he
flung
himself
into
his
chair
if
i
do
go
over
jap
will
think
i
have
my
lessons
so
that
all
right
and
i
wo
have
them
anyway
if
i
do
tackle
them
pretty
quick
so
here
goes
and
presently
the
only
sound
to
be
heard
was
the
ticking
of
the
little
clock
varied
by
the
turning
of
his
pages
or
the
rattling
of
the
paper
on
which
he
was
working
out
the
problems
for
oh
dear
me
jasper
polly
exclaimed
about
seven
i
believe
pickering
is
coming
he
has
his
lessons
i
suppose
said
jasper
you
know
i
told
him
to
come
over
as
soon
as
they
were
done
well
polly
we
agreed
you
know
to
let
him
alone
as
to
invitations
until
the
lessons
were
out
of
the
way
so
i
wo
go
over
after
him
i
know
said
polly
but
oh
jasper
is
it
just
too
elegant
for
anything
to
think
that
faber
says
it
all
right
with
him
i
should
think
it
was
cried
jasper
now
if
he
only
keeps
on
polly
oh
he
must
he
will
declared
polly
confidently
well
we
can
put
off
toasting
marshmallows
until
night
about
this
time
pickering
whose
lessons
were
all
done
for
he
had
as
faber
had
said
a
fine
capacity
to
learn
was
receiving
company
just
when
he
thought
he
was
safe
from
showing
his
face
let
stop
for
pickering
dodge
proposed
alexia
clare
having
run
in
for
her
to
go
over
to
polly
pepper
to
toast
marshmallows
and
have
fun
generally
all
right
so
we
can
cried
clare
so
they
turned
the
corner
and
went
down
to
the
cabot
mansion
and
were
let
in
before
the
old
butler
could
be
stopped
pickering
whose
uncle
and
aunt
were
out
for
the
evening
had
felt
it
safe
to
throw
himself
down
on
the
library
sofa
when
he
saw
that
john
had
forgotten
what
he
told
him
not
to
let
anybody
in
he
sprang
up
but
not
before
alexia
rushing
in
had
cried
oh
here
you
are
come
on
with
us
to
polly
pepper
clare
dashed
in
after
her
ow
exclaimed
pickering
seizing
a
sofa
pillow
to
jam
it
against
his
face
what
the
matter
cried
alexia
oh
have
you
a
toothache
worse
than
that
groaned
pickering
behind
his
pillow
oh
my
goodness
me
exclaimed
alexia
tumbling
back
what
can
it
be
you
have
broken
your
jaw
pick
observed
clare
i
ca
imagine
that
i
break
yours
if
you
do
go
said
pickering
savagely
and
half
smothered
as
he
tried
to
keep
the
pillow
well
before
the
two
pairs
of
eyes
this
was
a
little
difficult
as
clare
seeing
hopes
of
running
around
the
pillow
set
himself
in
motion
to
that
end
but
as
pickering
whirled
as
fast
as
he
did
there
was
no
great
gain
well
if
i
ever
did
exclaimed
alexia
quite
aghast
and
the
next
moment
pickering
keeping
a
little
opening
at
one
end
of
the
pillow
saw
his
chance
darted
out
of
the
door
and
flinging
the
pillow
the
length
of
the
hall
raced
into
his
own
room
and
slammed
the
door
and
they
could
hear
him
lock
it
well
if
i
ever
did
exclaimed
alexia
again
and
sinking
into
the
first
chair
she
raised
both
hands
what
got
into
the
beggar
cried
clare
in
perplexity
and
looking
out
into
the
hall
as
if
some
help
to
the
puzzle
might
be
found
there
well
i
guess
you
and
i
alexia
might
as
well
go
to
polly
pepper
he
said
finally
and
if
i
ever
come
after
that
boy
again
to
tell
him
of
anything
nice
that
going
to
happen
i
miss
my
guess
declared
alexia
getting
herself
out
of
her
chair
in
high
dudgeon
let
send
jasper
after
him
he
the
only
one
who
can
manage
him
she
cried
as
they
set
forth
good
idea
said
clare
but
when
alexia
told
of
their
funny
reception
jasper
first
stared
then
burst
out
laughing
and
although
alexia
teased
and
teased
she
got
no
satisfaction
it
no
use
alexia
jasper
said
wiping
his
eyes
you
wo
get
me
to
tell
so
let
set
about
having
some
fun
what
shall
we
do
i
do
want
to
do
anything
pouted
alexia
only
to
know
what
made
pickering
dodge
act
in
that
funny
way
and
that
just
what
you
wo
know
alexia
replied
jasper
composedly
well
polly
you
are
going
to
put
off
toasting
the
marshmallows
are
you
till
night
when
pick
can
probably
come
oh
i
would
wait
for
him
alexia
burst
out
quite
exasperated
when
he
acted
so
and
perhaps
he
come
with
an
old
sofa
pillow
before
his
face
if
you
did
oh
no
he
wo
alexia
said
jasper
going
off
into
another
laugh
but
although
she
teased
again
she
got
no
nearer
to
the
facts
and
polly
proposing
that
they
make
candy
the
chafing
dish
was
gotten
out
and
alexia
who
was
quite
an
adept
in
the
art
went
to
work
jasper
cracking
the
nuts
and
polly
and
clare
picking
out
the
meats
and
then
all
the
story
of
pickering
splendid
advance
in
the
tough
work
of
making
up
his
lessons
came
out
jasper
pausing
so
long
to
dilate
with
kindling
eyes
upon
it
that
very
few
nuts
fell
into
the
dish
so
fingers
were
the
only
ones
to
achieve
much
as
clare
gave
so
close
attention
to
the
story
that
he
was
a
very
poor
helper
in
the
midst
of
it
alexia
threw
down
the
spoon
and
clapped
her
hands
oh
i
know
she
exclaimed
oh
cried
polly
looking
up
from
the
little
pile
of
how
you
scared
me
alexia
i
know
i
know
exclaimed
alexia
again
and
nodding
to
herself
wisely
jasper
threw
her
a
quick
glance
it
said
if
you
know
do
tell
alexia
and
she
flashed
back
did
you
suppose
i
would
what
do
you
know
demanded
clare
transferring
his
attention
from
jasper
to
her
tell
on
alexia
what
do
you
know
oh
my
goodness
me
this
candy
never
will
be
done
in
time
for
those
meats
cried
alexia
picking
up
the
spoon
to
stir
away
for
dear
life
and
jasper
dashed
in
on
what
faber
said
about
pickering
chances
for
college
a
statement
that
completely
carried
clare
off
his
feet
so
to
speak
you
do
mean
that
he
thinks
pick
will
get
in
without
conditions
gasped
clare
dumfounded
yes
i
do
jasper
nodded
brightly
if
pick
will
only
study
keep
it
up
you
know
i
mean
to
the
end
he
surely
said
it
clare
it
was
so
much
for
clare
to
think
of
that
he
did
have
any
words
at
his
command
now
is
that
perfectly
splendid
in
pickering
cried
alexia
making
the
spoon
fly
merrily
oh
dear
me
i
forgot
to
put
in
the
butter
where
oh
here
it
is
and
she
tossed
in
a
big
piece
to
think
that
oh
dear
me
i
forgot
i
put
the
butter
in
before
now
spoilt
it
and
she
threw
down
the
spoon
in
despair
fish
it
out
cried
polly
hopping
up
and
seizing
the
spoon
to
make
little
dabs
at
the
ball
of
butter
now
rapidly
lessening
but
it
melted
that
is
almost
oh
dear
me
cried
alexia
no
it
is
there
see
how
big
it
is
polly
landed
it
deftly
on
the
plate
and
hopped
back
to
her
again
and
i
should
think
you
better
shake
yourself
clare
said
jasper
over
at
him
we
should
have
any
nuts
in
this
candy
if
it
depended
on
you
you
do
tell
such
astounding
stories
cried
clare
setting
to
work
at
once
and
jasper
making
as
much
noise
as
he
could
while
cracking
his
nuts
alexia
secret
was
safe
but
when
the
candy
was
set
out
to
cool
and
there
was
a
pause
in
which
the
two
boys
were
occupied
by
themselves
alexia
pulled
polly
off
to
a
corner
where
are
they
going
asked
clare
with
one
eye
after
them
oh
they
have
something
to
talk
over
i
presume
said
jasper
carelessly
nonsense
they
all
the
time
every
day
let
go
over
and
see
oh
no
said
jasper
come
on
clare
and
let
see
if
the
candy
is
cool
but
clare
did
want
to
see
if
the
candy
was
cool
nor
anything
else
but
to
have
his
own
way
so
he
proceeded
over
to
the
corner
by
himself
oho
you
go
right
away
cried
alexia
poking
up
her
head
over
shoulder
you
dreadful
boy
now
polly
come
and
she
pulled
her
off
into
the
library
you
see
you
did
get
anything
for
your
pains
said
jasper
bursting
into
a
laugh
you
much
better
have
staid
here
well
i
do
want
to
know
anyway
said
clare
taking
a
sudden
interest
in
the
candy
i
believe
it
is
cold
jasper
let
look
polly
alexia
was
saying
in
the
library
behind
the
portières
i
know
now
because
i
did
it
once
myself
it
was
when
you
first
promised
be
a
friend
to
me
and
i
went
home
and
cried
for
very
joy
and
i
want
to
see
anybody
that
night
oh
alexia
exclaimed
polly
giving
her
a
hug
that
satisfied
even
alexia
no
i
did
and
i
remember
how
i
wanted
to
hold
something
up
to
my
face
i
never
thought
of
a
sofa
pillow
and
i
could
have
gotten
it
if
i
had
thought
aunt
had
it
crammed
against
her
back
oh
my
eyes
were
a
sight
polly
and
my
nose
was
all
over
my
face
xxiii
the
clemcy
garden
party
you
may
go
on
those
errands
hortense
but
first
send
polly
pepper
to
me
commanded
chatterton
sharply
the
french
maid
paused
in
the
act
of
hanging
up
a
gown
i
will
her
madame
i
should
not
like
to
send
mees
polly
peppaire
polly
pepper
chatterton
was
guilty
of
stamping
her
foot
are
you
mad
i
am
speaking
of
polly
pepper
this
country
girl
who
is
as
poor
and
here
in
this
house
as
if
in
her
little
brown
house
wherever
that
may
be
hortense
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
hung
up
the
gown
has
madame
any
further
commands
for
me
she
asked
coming
up
to
her
mistress
yes
be
sure
to
get
the
velvet
at
lemaire
and
take
back
the
silk
kimono
i
will
send
to
new
york
for
one
yes
madame
that
is
all
besides
the
other
errands
now

she
dismissed
her
with
a
wave
of
her
shapely
hand
but
first
as
i
bade
you
polly
pepper
to
me
hortense
with
another
elevation
of
her
shoulders
said
nothing
till
she
found
herself
the
other
side
of
the
door
then
she
shook
her
fist
at
it
it
ees
not
miss
polly
who
will
be
sent
for
it
ees
madame
who
will
be
sent
out
of
dees
house
ha
ha
ha
she
laughed
softly
to
herself
all
the
way
downstairs
with
an
insolent
little
fling
to
her
head
that
boded
ill
for
her
mistress
interests
meanwhile
chatterton
was
angrily
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
what
arrant
nonsense
a
man
can
be
capable
of
when
he
is
headstrong
to
begin
with
to
think
of
the
elegant
horatio
king
a
model
for
all
men
surrounding
himself
with
this
commonplace
family
faugh
it
is
easy
enough
to
see
what
they
are
all
after
but
i
shall
prevent
it
meanwhile
the
only
way
to
do
it
is
to
break
the
spirit
of
this
polly
pepper
once
do
that
and
i
have
the
task
easy
to
my
hand
she
listened
intently
it
ca
be
possible
she
would
refuse
to
come
ha
i
thought
so
polly
came
quietly
in
no
one
to
see
her
face
would
have
supposed
that
she
had
thrown
aside
the
book
she
had
been
waiting
weeks
to
read
so
that
lessons
and
music
need
not
suffer
for
she
was
really
glad
when
chatterton
french
maid
asked
her
respectfully
if
she
would
please
be
so
good
as
to
step
up
to
her
mistress
apartments
vous
mees
polly
yes
indeed
cried
polly
springing
off
from
the
and
forgetting
the
enchanted
immediately
in
the
rush
of
delight
oh
i
have
another
chance
to
try
to
please
her
she
thought
skimming
over
the
stairs
but
she
was
careful
to
restrain
her
steps
on
reaching
the
room
you
may
take
that
paper
said
chatterton
seating
herself
in
her
favorite
chair
and
read
to
me
you
know
the
things
i
desire
to
hear
or
ought
to
she
pointed
to
the
society
news
lying
on
the
table
polly
took
it
up
glad
to
be
of
the
least
service
and
whirled
it
over
to
get
the
fashion
items
feeling
sure
that
now
she
was
on
the
right
road
to
favor
do
rattle
it
cried
chatterton
in
a
thin
high
voice
i
try
not
to
said
polly
wishing
she
could
be
like
mamsie
and
doing
her
best
to
get
to
the
inner
page
quietly
and
why
do
you
read
where
you
are
cried
chatterton
begin
on
the
first
page
i
wish
to
hear
that
first
polly
turned
the
sheet
back
again
and
obeyed
but
she
had
read
more
than
a
paragraph
when
she
came
to
a
dead
stop
go
on
commanded
chatterton
her
eyes
sparkling
she
had
forgotten
to
play
with
her
rings
being
perfectly
absorbed
in
the
delicious
morsels
of
exceedingly
unsavory
gossip
she
was
hearing
polly
laid
the
paper
in
her
lap
and
her
two
hands
fell
upon
it
oh
chatterton
she
cried
the
color
flying
from
her
cheek
please
let
me
read
something
else
to
you
mamsie
would
like
me
to
read
this
the
brown
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
she
leaned
forward
imploringly
stuff
and
nonsense
exclaimed
chatterton
passionately
i
command
you
to
read
that
girl
do
you
hear
me
i
can
not
said
polly
in
a
low
voice
mamsie
would
like
it
but
it
was
perfectly
distinct
and
fell
upon
the
angry
ears
clearly
and
storm
as
she
might
chatterton
knew
that
the
little
country
maiden
would
never
bend
to
her
will
in
this
case
i
would
have
you
to
know
that
i
understand
much
better
than
your
mother
possibly
can
what
is
for
your
good
to
read
besides
she
will
never
know
mamsie
knows
every
single
thing
that
we
children
do
cried
polly
decidedly
and
lifting
her
pale
face
and
she
understands
better
than
any
one
else
about
what
we
ought
to
do
for
she
is
our
mother
what
arrant
nonsense
exclaimed
chatterton
passionately
and
unable
to
control
herself
at
the
prospect
of
losing
polly
for
a
reader
which
she
could
endure
as
she
thoroughly
enjoyed
her
services
in
that
line
she
got
out
of
her
chair
and
paced
up
and
down
the
long
apartment
angrily
saying
all
sorts
of
most
disagreeable
things
that
polly
only
half
heard
so
busy
was
she
debating
in
her
own
mind
what
she
ought
to
do
should
she
run
out
of
the
room
and
leave
this
dreadful
old
woman
that
every
one
in
the
house
was
tired
of
surely
she
had
tried
enough
to
please
her
but
she
could
not
do
what
mamsie
would
never
approve
of
and
just
as
polly
had
about
decided
to
slip
out
she
looked
up
chatterton
having
exhausted
her
passion
as
it
seemed
to
do
no
good
was
returning
to
her
seat
with
such
a
dreary
step
and
forlorn
expression
that
she
seemed
ten
years
older
she
really
looked
very
feeble
and
polly
broke
out
impulsively
oh
let
me
read
the
other
part
of
the
paper
dear
chatterton
may
i
read
it
said
chatterton
ungraciously
and
sat
down
in
her
favorite
chair
polly
scarcely
believing
her
ears
whirled
over
the
sheet
and
determined
to
read
as
well
as
she
possibly
could
managed
to
throw
so
much
enthusiasm
into
the
fashion
hints
and
social
items
that
presently
chatterton
eyes
were
sparkling
again
although
she
was
deprived
of
her
unsavory
morsels
and
before
long
she
was
eagerly
telling
polly
to
read
over
certain
dictates
of
the
paris
correspondent
who
was
laying
down
the
law
for
feminine
dress
and
calling
again
for
the
last
information
of
the
movements
of
members
of
her
social
set
till
there
could
be
no
question
of
her
enjoyment
polly
not
knowing
or
caring
how
long
she
had
been
thus
occupied
so
long
as
chatterton
was
happy
was
only
conscious
that
hortense
came
back
from
the
errands
which
occasioned
only
a
brief
pause
put
the
parcels
down
said
chatterton
scarcely
glancing
at
her
i
can
not
attend
to
you
now
go
on
polly
so
polly
went
on
until
the
fashionable
and
social
world
had
been
so
thoroughly
canvassed
that
even
chatterton
was
quite
convinced
that
she
could
get
no
more
from
the
paper
you
may
go
now
she
said
but
with
a
hungry
glance
for
the
first
page
then
she
tore
her
gaze
away
and
repeated
more
coldly
than
ever
you
may
go
polly
ran
off
dismayed
to
find
how
happy
she
was
at
the
release
her
feet
unaccustomed
to
sitting
still
so
long
were
numb
and
little
prickles
were
running
up
and
down
her
legs
she
hurried
as
fast
as
she
could
into
mamsie
room
feeling
in
need
of
all
the
good
cheer
she
could
find
fisher
has
gone
out
said
jane
going
along
the
hall
gone
out
repeated
polly
oh
where
do
you
know
jane
i
do
exactly
know
said
jane
but
she
took
miss
phronsie
and
i
think
it
shopping
they
went
for
king
has
taken
them
in
the
carriage
oh
i
know
it
is
cried
polly
and
a
dreadful
feeling
surged
through
her
why
had
she
spent
all
this
time
with
that
horrible
old
woman
and
lost
this
precious
treat
they
thought
you
had
gone
to
the
salisbury
school
said
jane
wishing
she
could
give
some
comfort
for
they
wanted
you
awfully
to
go
and
now
i
lost
it
all
cried
polly
at
a
white
heat
all
this
perfectly
splendid
time
with
grandpapa
and
mamsie
and
phronsie
just
for
the
sake
of
a
horrible
then
she
broke
short
off
and
ran
back
into
mamsie
room
and
flung
herself
down
by
the
bed
just
as
she
used
to
do
by
the
in
the
bedroom
of
the
little
brown
house
why
polly
child
mother
fisher
voice
was
very
cheery
as
she
came
in
phronsie
hurrying
after
i
do
see
her
began
phronsie
in
a
puzzled
way
and
peering
on
all
sides
where
is
she
mamsie
fisher
went
over
and
laid
her
hand
on
polly
brown
head
now
phronsie
you
may
run
out
that
is
a
good
girl
she
leaned
over
and
set
a
kiss
on
phronsie
red
lips
is
polly
sick
asked
phronsie
going
off
to
the
door
obediently
but
looking
back
with
wondering
eyes
no
dear
i
think
not
said
fisher
run
along
dear
i
am
so
glad
she
is
sick
said
phronsie
as
she
went
slowly
off
yet
she
carried
a
troubled
face
i
ought
to
go
and
see
how
sinbad
is
she
decided
as
she
went
downstairs
this
visit
was
an
everyday
performance
to
be
carefully
gone
through
with
so
she
passed
out
of
the
big
side
doorway
to
the
veranda
there
is
michael
now
she
cried
joyfully
espying
that
individual
raking
up
the
west
lawn
so
skipping
off
she
flew
over
to
him
this
caught
the
attention
of
little
dick
from
the
nursery
window
hurry
up
there
he
cried
crossly
to
battles
who
was
having
a
hard
time
anyway
getting
him
into
a
fresh
sailor
suit
oh
dicky
dicky
called
mamma
softly
from
her
room
i
ca
help
it
mamma
battles
is
slow
and
poky
he
fumed
oh
no
dear
said
his
mother
battles
always
gets
you
ready
very
swiftly
as
well
as
nicely
battles
a
comfortable
person
turned
her
round
face
with
a
smile
toward
the
door
and
if
you
was
more
like
your
mamma
master
dick
you
be
through
with
dressing
and
make
everything
more
pleasant
to
yourself
and
to
every
one
else
well
i
not
in
the
least
like
mamma
battles
i
ca
be
no
indeed
you
ai
but
you
can
try
said
battles
encouragingly
why
battles
whitney
exclaimed
dick
whirling
around
on
her
in
astonishment
or
any
excitement
dicky
invariably
gave
her
the
whole
name
that
he
felt
she
ought
to
possess
mara
battles
not
being
at
all
within
his
comprehension
what
an
story
dicky
dicky
reproved
whitney
well
i
ca
help
it
mamma
dick
now
escaped
from
battles
hands
altogether
and
fled
into
the
other
room
the
comfortable
person
following
she
said
plunging
up
to
her
chair
in
great
excitement
that
i
could
be
like
you
i
said
you
could
try
to
be
corrected
battles
smoothing
down
her
apron
and
she
knows
i
ca
ever
be
in
all
this
world
declared
dick
shaking
his
short
curls
in
decision
and
glancing
back
to
see
the
effect
for
you
a
woman
and
i
always
going
to
be
a
man
why
see
how
big
i
am
now
he
squared
off
and
strutted
up
and
down
the
little
boudoir
and
you
be
bigger
if
you
let
me
fix
your
blouse
and
button
it
up
declared
battles
laughing
and
bearing
down
on
him
to
fasten
the
band
and
tuck
in
the
vest
and
if
you
were
more
like
your
mother
in
disposition
that
what
i
mean
be
a
sight
comfortabler
for
you
and
every
one
else
now
says
i
your
hair
got
to
be
brushed
and
she
led
him
back
into
the
nursery
laughing
all
the
way
what
makes
you
shake
so
when
you
laugh
battles
asked
dick
suddenly
and
ignoring
all
references
to
his
disposition
ca
help
it
said
battles
beginning
work
on
the
curls
because
there
so
much
of
me
i
suppose
and
she
laughed
more
than
ever
there
so
very
much
of
you
battles
observed
dick
with
a
critical
look
all
over
her
rotund
figure
what
makes
it
oh
i
do
know
said
battles
stand
still
dicky
and
i
be
through
all
the
sooner
some
folks
is
big
and
round
and
some
folks
is
little
and
scrawny
what
scrawny
asked
dick
who
always
got
as
many
alleviations
by
conversation
as
possible
out
of
the
detested
why
thin
and
lean
oh
well
go
on
battles
and
i
one
of
the
big
and
round
ones
said
battles
seeing
no
occasion
in
that
statement
to
abate
her
cheerfulness
so
she
laughed
again
i
like
you
big
and
round
battles
cried
little
dick
affectionately
and
whirling
about
so
suddenly
as
to
endanger
his
eye
with
the
comb
doing
good
execution
and
he
essayed
to
put
his
arms
around
her
waist
which
he
was
always
hoping
to
be
able
to
accomplish
that
good
said
battles
laughing
well
pleased
but
you
jump
around
so
there
now
in
a
minute
you
shall
be
off
and
she
took
up
the
brush
i
must
declared
dick
remembering
his
sight
of
phronsie
running
across
the
lawn
do
hurry
battles
he
pleaded
which
so
won
her
heart
that
she
abridged
part
of
the
brushing
and
let
him
scamper
off
phronsie
was
kneeling
down
in
front
of
sinbad
kennel
ca
you
untie
him
michael
she
asked
a
question
she
had
propounded
each
morning
since
the
boys
went
back
to
school
yes
miss
phronsie
i
think
i
can
he
wonted
now
and
the
other
dogs
are
accustomed
to
him
besides
i
locked
up
jerry
since
he
fit
him
i
know
said
phronsie
sorrowfully
that
was
naughty
of
jerry
when
sinbad
had
only
just
come
michael
scratched
his
head
he
could
tell
her
what
was
on
his
mind
that
sinbad
was
scarcely
such
a
dog
as
any
one
would
buy
and
therefore
his
presence
was
not
to
be
relished
by
the
animals
already
at
home
on
the
place
well
you
know
miss
phronsie
he
said
at
last
it
kinder
difficult
like
to
expect
some
dogs
to
remember
their
manners
and
jerry
like
all
the
others
in
that
respect
please
tell
him
about
it
said
phronsie
earnestly
how
good
prince
is
to
sinbad
and
then
i
guess
he
want
to
be
like
him
for
phronsie
had
never
swerved
in
her
allegiance
to
prince
ever
since
he
saved
her
from
the
naughty
organ
man
in
the
days
and
in
all
her
conversations
with
the
other
dogs
she
invariably
held
up
jasper
big
black
dog
his
great
friend
and
companion
since
pinafore
days
as
their
model
and
just
then
dicky
ran
up
breathlessly
dick
announced
phronsie
excitedly
michael
is
going
to
let
sinbad
out
and
she
clasped
her
hands
in
delight
jolly
exclaimed
dick
capering
about
now
master
dick
you
must
let
the
dog
alone
cried
michael
time
to
try
him
with
his
freedom
a
bit
he
chafin
at
that
chain
he
looked
anxiously
at
dick
stand
off
there
both
of
you
and
he
slipped
the
chain
off
sinbad
gave
a
little
wiggle
with
his
hind
legs
and
stretched
his
yellow
body
it
was
too
good
to
be
true
but
it
was
though
he
was
free
and
he
shot
out
from
his
kennel
which
was
down
in
the
gardener
quarters
and
quite
removed
from
the
other
dogs
and
fairly
tore
his
ragged
little
tail
straight
out
across
the
west
lawn
oh
he
run
back
to
joel
at
school
cried
dick
who
had
heard
joel
say
he
must
be
tied
at
first
when
everything
was
strange
and
he
started
on
a
mad
run
after
him
you
stay
still
roared
michael
that
dog
is
only
stretchin
his
legs
he
come
back
but
as
well
tell
the
north
wind
to
stop
blowing
dicky
blouse
puffed
out
with
the
breeze
as
his
small
legs
executed
fine
speed
oh
michael
cried
phronsie
in
the
greatest
distress
make
dicky
come
back
oh
he
come
back
said
michael
reassuringly
though
he
quaked
inwardly
and
so
dicky
did
but
it
was
now
a
matter
of
sinbad
chasing
him
for
as
michael
had
said
the
dog
after
stretching
his
legs
as
the
mad
rush
across
the
lawn
enabled
him
to
do
now
was
very
much
pleased
to
return
for
a
little
petting
at
the
hands
of
those
people
who
had
given
him
every
reason
to
expect
that
he
should
receive
it
and
supposing
from
dick
chase
after
him
that
a
race
was
agreeable
he
set
forth
his
ears
as
ragged
as
his
tail
pricked
up
in
the
fullest
enjoyment
of
the
occasion
but
dick
saw
nothing
in
it
to
enjoy
and
exerting
all
his
strength
to
keep
ahead
which
he
could
do
as
well
for
the
reason
that
he
was
screaming
fearfully
sinbad
came
up
with
him
easily
dicky
turning
his
head
in
mad
terror
at
that
instant
stumbled
and
fell
sinbad
unable
to
stop
at
short
notice
or
rather
no
notice
at
all
rolled
over
with
him
in
a
heap
this
brought
all
the
to
the
scene
besides
whitney
who
had
seen
some
of
the
affair
from
her
window
and
finally
when
everything
was
beginning
to
be
calmed
down
battles
reached
the
lawn
sinbad
was
in
phronsie
lap
who
sat
on
the
grass
holding
him
tightly
oh
phronsie
gasped
whitney
at
that
michael
do
take
him
away
as
she
fled
by
to
dick
one
of
the
was
brushing
off
the
grime
from
his
sailor
suit
the
dog
is
all
right
said
michael
was
only
play
i
master
joel
has
raced
with
him
was
only
play
repeated
little
dick
who
now
that
he
found
himself
whole
was
surprised
the
idea
had
occurred
to
him
before
hoh
not
hurt
and
i
going
to
race
with
him
again
not
dicky
said
whitney
looking
him
all
over
anxiously
he
all
right
declared
michael
they
just
rolled
over
together
you
see
the
dog
could
stop
he
was
so
fast
when
the
youngster
turned
right
in
his
face
and
dick
to
prove
his
soundness
of
body
and
restoration
of
mind
ran
up
to
phronsie
and
flung
himself
down
on
the
grass
by
her
side
sinbad
received
him
as
a
most
pleasant
acquaintance
cocked
up
his
ragged
ears
and
tried
to
wag
his
poor
little
scrubby
tail
never
quite
getting
it
into
his
head
that
it
was
long
and
graceful
and
then
he
set
upon
the
task
of
licking
dick
hands
all
over
and
as
much
of
his
face
as
was
possible
to
compass
see
that
now
cried
michael
triumphantly
pointing
that
dog
be
handsome
but
he
hai
got
a
bad
bone
in
his
body
if
he
does
look
like
the
evil
one
hisself
this
episode
absorbing
all
their
attention
nobody
heard
or
saw
alexia
rhys
running
lightly
up
over
the
terrace
oh
my
what
you
doing
and
where
polly
she
asked
of
whitney
it
being
soon
told
alexia
who
evidently
had
some
exciting
piece
of
news
for
polly
ran
into
the
house
polly
she
called
oh
polly
pepper
where
you
running
over
the
stairs
at
the
same
time
but
polly
as
we
have
seen

not
in
her
room
now
then
mother
fisher
said
at
sound
of
alexia
voice
as
finished
our
talk
polly
why
you
must
run
down
and
see
her
but
polly
clung
to
her
mother
neck
do

think
i
ought
to
go
next
saturday
morning
out
shopping
mamsie
after
i

so
naughty

cried
fisher
in
her
most
decisive
fashion
dear
me
that
would
be
very
dreadful
polly
after
we
put
it
off
for
you
when
we
thought
you
had
gone
down
to
the
salisbury
school
why
we
could
get
along
without
you
polly
so
polly
with
a
happy
feeling
at
her
heart
that
she
was
really
needed
to
make
the
shopping
trip
a
success
and
best
of
all
for
the
long
talk
with
mamsie
that
had
set
many
things
right
ran
down
to
meet
alexia
brimming
over
with
her
important
news
where
you
been
demanded
alexia
just
on
the
point
of
rushing
out
of
polly
room
in
despair
i
looked
everywhere
for
you
even
in
the
and
without
waiting
for
a
reply
she
dragged
polly
back
oh
you
ca
possibly
guess
her
pale
eyes
gleaming
with
excitement
then
tell
me
do
alexia
begged
polly
scarcely
less
wrought
up
oh
polly
the
most
elegant
thing
imaginable
alexia
dearly
loved
to
spin
out
her
exciting
news
as
long
as
possible
driving
the
girls
almost
frantic
by
such
methods
well
if
you
are
not
going
to
tell
me
i
might
as
well
go
back
again
up
in
mamsie
room
declared
polly
working
herself
free
from
the
long
arms
and
starting
for
the
door
oh
i
tell
polly
i
tell
cried
alexia
plunging
after
miss
salisbury
says
i
just
been
up
to
the
school
after
my
german
grammar
that
john
clemcy
and
miss
ophelia
have
invited
the
whole
salisbury
school
out
there
for
next
saturday
afternoon
think
of
it
after
that
smashed
vase
polly
pepper
polly
pepper
sat
down
on
the
quite
gone
in
surprise
it
was
as
alexia
had
said
a
most
surprising
thing
when
one
took
into
consideration
how
much
john
clemcy
had
suffered
from
the
carelessness
of
a
salisbury
pupil
on
the
occasion
of
the
accidental
visit
but
evidently
one
of
his
reasons
though
by
no
means
the
only
one
was
his
wish
to
salve
the
feelings
of
the
gentlewomen
who
were
constantly
endeavoring
to
show
him
their
overwhelming
sorrow
and
trying
to
make
all
possible
reparation
for
the
loss
of
the
vase
and
he
had
stated
his
desire
so
forcibly
on
one
of
the
many
visits
to
the
school
that
seemed
to
be
necessary
after
the
accident
that
miss
salisbury
was
unable
to
refuse
the
invitation
although
it
nearly
threw
her
as
she
usually
was
into
a
panic
at
the
very
idea
but
why
did
you
promise
sister
miss
anstice
turned
on
her
on
the
withdrawal
of
the
gentleman
whose
english
composure
of
face
and
bearing
was
now
in
its
victory
especially
trying
to
bear
i
am
surprised
at
you
something
dreadful
will
surely
happen
do
anstice
begged
miss
salisbury
nervous
to
the
last
degree
since
even
the
support
of
sister
was
to
be
withdrawn
it
was
the
least
i
could
do
to
please
him
after
what
has
happened
well
something
will
surely
happen
mourned
miss
anstice
you
know
how
unfortunate
it
has
been
from
the
very
beginning
i
never
been
able
to
look
at
that
gown
since
although
it
has
been
washed
till
every
stain
is
removed
put
it
on
for
this
visit
sister
advised
miss
salisbury
with
a
healthy
disapproval
of
superstitions
and
break
the
charm
oh
never
miss
anstice
raised
her
slender
hands
i
would
run
such
a
chance
as
to
wear
that
gown
for
all
the
world
it
will
be
unlucky
enough
you
will
see
without
that
sister
but
as
far
as
anybody
could
see
everything
was
perfectly
harmonious
and
successful
on
the
following
saturday
afternoon
to
begin
with
the
weather
was
perfect
although
at
extremely
short
intervals
miss
anstice
kept
reminding
her
sister
that
a
tremendous
shower
might
be
expected
when
the
expedition
was
once
under
way
the
girls
when
they
received
their
invitation
monday
morning
from
miss
salisbury
in
the
long
schoolroom
were
to
state
it
figuratively
taken
off
their
feet
in
surprise
with
the
exception
of
those
fortunate
enough
to
have
caught
snatches
of
the
news
always
sure
to
travel
fast
when
set
going
by
alexia
and
wild
was
the
rejoicing
when
they
could
forget
the
broken
vase
at
the
prospect
of
another
expedition
under
miss
salisbury
guidance
if
miss
anstice
only
were
going
sighed
clem
she
is
such
a
fussy
old
thing
it
spoils
everybody
fun
just
to
look
at
her
well
do
look
at
her
advised
alexia
calmly
for
my
part
i
never
do
unless
i
ca
help
it
how
are
you
going
to
help
it
cried
amy
garrett
dismally
when
you
are
in
her
classes
oh
dear
i
do
wish
miss
salisbury
would
get
rid
of
her
as
a
teacher
and
let
miss
wilcox
take
her
place
miss
wilcox
is
just
gay
exclaimed
silvia
well
do
let
talk
of
that
old
frump
any
more
goodness
me
here
she
comes
as
miss
anstice
advanced
down
the
long
hall
where
the
girls
were
discussing
the
wonderful
invitation
after
school
and
as
the
day
was
perfect
so
the
spirits
of
the
salisbury
girls
were
at
their
highest
and
kimball
and
his
associates
drove
them
over
in
the
same
big
barges
the
veteran
leader
not
recovering
from
the
surprise
into
which
he
had
been
thrown
by
this
afternoon
party
given
to
the
salisbury
school
by
clemcy
and
his
sister
of
all
things
in
this
world
this
is
th
he
muttered
several
times
on
the
way
a
good
ten
year
or
more
those
english
folks
have
been
drawin
back
in
them
pretty
grounds
an
offendin
every
one
an
now
to
get
a
passel
o
girls
to
run
over
an
stomp
all
down
being
unable
to
solve
the
puzzle
it
afforded
him
plenty
of
occupation
to
work
away
at
it
clemcy
and
miss
ophelia
caring
as
little
for
the
opinion
of
the
as
for
the
rest
of
the
world
received
the
visitors
on
the
broad
stone
piazza
whose
pillars
ran
the
length
of
the
house
and
up
to
the
roof
affording
a
wide
gallery
above
it
was
all
entwined
with
english
ivy
and
creepers
taken
from
the
homestead
in
devonshire
and
brought
away
when
the
death
of
the
old
mother
made
it
impossible
for
life
to
be
sustained
by
miss
ophelia
unless
wrenched
up
from
the
roots
where
clustered
so
many
memories
so
brother
john
decided
to
make
that
wrench
and
to
make
it
complete
so
here
they
were
i
did
know
it
was
so
pretty
cried
clem
after
the
ladies
had
been
welcomed
with
the
most
gracious
hospitality
and
the
schoolgirls
tumbled
out
of
the
barges
to
throng
up
it
rained
so
when
we
were
here
before
we
could
see
anything
pretty
repeated
alexia
comprehending
it
all
in
swift
glances
it
perfectly
beautiful
she
turned
and
clemcy
who
was
regarding
her
smiled
and
they
struck
up
a
friendship
on
the
spot
miss
salisbury
allow
me
clemcy
was
leading
her
off
miss
anstice
not
trusting
the
white
gown
rustled
after
in
the
black
silk
one
with
miss
ophelia
down
the
wide
hall
open
at
the
end
with
vistas
of
broad
fields
beyond
where
the
host
paused
let
the
young
ladies
come
he
said
and
the
girls
trooped
after
to
crowd
around
the
elder
people
amongst
the
palms
and
bookcases
with
which
the
broad
hall
was
lined
was
a
pedestal
whose
top
was
half
covered
with
a
soft
filmy
cloth
clemcy
lifted
this
and
took
it
off
carefully
there
stood
the
little
vase
presenting
as
brave
an
appearance
as
in
its
first
perfection
illustration
there
stood
the
little
vase
presenting
as
brave
an
appearance
as
in
its
first
perfection
miss
salisbury
uttered
no
exclamation
but
preserved
her
composure
by
a
violent
effort
i
flatter
myself
on
my
ability
to
repair
my
broken
collection
began
clemcy
when
a
loud
exclamation
from
the
girls
in
front
startled
every
one
miss
anstice
on
the
first
shock
had
been
unable
to
find
that
composure
that
was
always
sister
envied
possession
so
despite
the
environment
of
the
black
silk
gown
she
gave
it
up
and
sank
gradually
to
the
ground
i
told
you
so
cried
clem
in
a
hoarse
whisper
to
her
nearest
neighbors
she
always
spoils
everybody
fun
as
miss
anstice
at
the
host
suggestion
his
sister
being
rendered
incapable
of
action
at
this
sudden
emergency
was
put
to
rest
in
one
of
the
pretty
rooms
above
till
such
time
as
she
could
recover
herself
enough
to
join
them
below
i
could
help
it
sister
she
said
i
been
so
worried
about
that
vase
do
know
because
you
are
always
so
calm
and
then
to
see
it
standing
there
it
quite
took
away
my
breath
oh
the
delights
of
the
in
which
every
variety
of
the
rose
seemed
to
have
had
a
place
lovingly
assigned
to
it
sweetbrier
clambered
over
the
walls
of
the
gardener
cottage
the
stables
and
charming
into
which
the
girls
ran
with
delight
for
clemcy
had
said
they
were
to
go
everywhere
and
enjoy
everything
without
restraint
he
a
dear
exclaimed
lucy
bennett
only
i
mortally
afraid
of
him
well
i
not
proclaimed
alexia
the
idea
of
alexia
being
in
any
state
that
would
suggest
fear
being
so
funny
the
girls
burst
out
laughing
well
we
any
of
us
feel
like
laughing
much
in
a
little
while
said
clem
dolefully
what
is
the
matter
cried
a
dozen
voices
matter
enough
replied
clem
i
said
so
before
and
now
i
know
coming
just
look
at
that
she
pushed
aside
the
swaying
branches
of
the
sweetbrier
and
pointed
tragically
i
do
see
anything
said
one
or
two
of
the
girls
there
meant
clemcy
and
miss
salisbury
passing
down
the
the
broad
central
path
he
was
evidently
showing
her
some
treasured
variety
and
descanting
on
it
the
principal
of
the
salisbury
school
from
her
wide
knowledge
of
roses
as
well
as
of
other
subjects
being
able
to
respond
very
intelligently
oh
ca
you
see
you
stupid
things
cried
clem
he
going
to
marry
our
miss
salisbury
and
then
she
give
up
our
school
and
and
she
turned
away
and
threw
herself
off
in
a
corner
a
whole
chorus
of
no
no
burst
upon
this
speech
hush
cried
alexia
quite
horrified
polly
do
stop
them
miss
salisbury
is
turning
around
and
she
been
worried
quite
enough
over
that
dreadful
miss
anstice
which
had
the
effect
of
reducing
the
girls
to
quiet
but
it
is
so
cried
the
girls
in
frantic
whispers
what
clem
says
and
those
who
were
not
sure
of
themselves
huddled
down
on
the
floor
say
alexia
you
do
think
so
do
you
but
alexia
would
give
them
no
comfort
but
wisely
seizing
polly
arm
departed
with
her
i
shall
say
something
that
i
be
sorry
for
she
declared
if
i
stay
another
moment
longer
for
polly
pepper
i
do
really
believe
that
it
true
what
clem
says
and
the
rest
of
that
beautiful
afternoon
with
rambles
over
the
wide
estate
and
tea
with
berries
and
cream
on
the
terraces
was
a
dream
scarcely
comprehended
by
the
salisbury
girls
who
were
strangely
quiet
and
for
this
miss
salisbury
was
thankful
and
presently
miss
anstice
coming
down
in
the
wake
of
miss
ophelia
was
put
carefully
into
a
comfortable
chair
on
the
stone
veranda
where
she
sat
pale
and
quiet
miss
clemcy
assiduously
devoting
herself
to
her
and
drawing
up
a
little
table
to
her
side
for
her
berries
and
cream
and
tea
now
we
will
be
comfortable
together
said
miss
ophelia
the
maid
bringing
her
special
little
pot
of
tea
i
am
so
mortified
my
dear
miss
clemcy
began
miss
anstice
her
little
hands
nervously
working
to
have
given
way
all
of
which
she
had
said
over
and
over
to
her
hostess
in
the
room
and
you
are
so
kind
to
overlook
it
so
beautifully
it
is
impossible
to
blame
one
of
your
delicate
sensibility
said
miss
ophelia
with
her
healthy
english
composure
quite
in
her
element
to
have
some
one
to
fuss
over
and
to
make
comfortable
in
her
own
way
now
then
i
trust
that
tea
is
quite
right
handing
her
a
cup
xxiv
the
piece
of
news
pepper
you
wanted
dick
furness
banged
into
joel
room
then
out
again
adding
two
words
harrow
immediately
all
right
said
joel
whistling
on
all
his
thoughts
upon
moose
island
and
the
expedition
there
on
the
morrow
and
he
ran
lightly
down
to
the
second
floor
and
into
the
room
harrow
was
waiting
for
him
and
pushing
aside
some
books
for
he
never
seemed
to
be
quite
free
from
them
even
for
a
moment
he
motioned
joel
to
a
seat
joel
whose
pulses
were
throbbing
with
the
liveliest
expectations
did
bother
his
head
with
what
otherwise
might
have
struck
him
as
somewhat
queer
in
the
manner
for
the
thing
in
hand
was
what
joel
principally
gave
himself
to
and
as
that
clearly
could
be
nothing
else
than
the
moose
island
expedition
it
naturally
followed
that
harrow
had
to
speak
twice
before
he
could
gain
his
attention
but
when
it
was
gained
there
was
not
the
slightest
possible
chance
of
misunderstanding
what
the
was
saying
for
it
was
the
habit
of
this
instructor
to
come
directly
to
the
point
without
unnecessary
circumlocution
but
his
voice
and
manner
were
not
without
a
touch
of
sadness
on
this
occasion
that
softened
the
speech
itself
joel
my
boy
harrow
began
you
know
i
have
often
had
you
down
here
to
urge
on
those
lessons
of
yours
yes
sir
said
joel
wondering
now
at
the
voice
and
manner
well
now
i
am
instructed
by
the
master
to
send
for
you
for
a
different
reason
can
you
not
guess
no
sir
said
joel
comfortable
in
the
way
things
had
been
going
on
and
wholly
unable
to
imagine
the
blow
about
to
fall
i
wish
you
had
guessed
it
joel
said
harrow
moving
uneasily
in
his
chair
for
then
you
would
have
made
my
task
easier
joel
marks
says
on
account
of
your
falling
behind
in
your
lessons
without
reason
understand
this
joel
you
are
not
to
go
to
moose
island
even
then
joel
did
not
comprehend
so
harrow
repeated
it
distinctly
roared
joel
in
his
excitement
he
cleared
the
space
between
them
and
gained
harrow
side
go
to
moose
island
mr
his
black
eyes
widening
and
his
face
working
fearfully
no
said
harrow
drawing
a
long
breath
you
are
not
to
go
so
marks
says
but
i
go
cried
joel
quite
gone
in
passion
is
a
singular
word
to
use
here
joel
observed
harrow
sternly
but
i
oh
harrow
do
see
if
you
ca
help
me
to
go
joel
squirmed
all
over
and
even
clutched
the
arm
piteously
alas
joel
it
is
beyond
my
power
harrow
shook
his
head
he
did
think
it
necessary
to
state
that
he
had
already
used
every
argument
he
could
employ
to
induce
marks
to
change
his
mind
some
strong
pressure
must
be
brought
to
bear
upon
pepper
or
he
will
amount
to
nothing
but
an
athletic
lad
he
must
see
the
value
of
study
the
master
had
responded
and
signified
that
the
interview
was
ended
and
his
command
was
to
be
carried
out
joel
harrow
was
speaking
be
a
man
and
bear
this
as
can
you
had
your
chances
for
study
and
not
taken
them
it
is
a
case
of
now
remember
marks
is
doing
this
in
love
to
you
he
has
got
to
fit
you
out
as
well
as
he
can
in
this
school
to
take
that
place
in
life
that
your
mother
wants
you
to
fill
do
waste
a
moment
on
vain
regrets
but
buckle
to
your
studies
now
it
was
a
long
speech
for
the
and
he
had
a
hard
time
getting
through
with
it
at
its
end
joel
half
dazed
with
his
misfortune
but
with
a
feeling
that
as
a
man
marks
and
harrow
had
treated
him
hurried
back
to
his
room
dragged
his
chair
up
to
the
table
and
pushing
off
the
untidy
collection
of
rackets
tennis
balls
boxing
gloves
and
other
implements
of
his
gymnasium
work
and
his
recreation
hours
lent
his
whole
heart
with
a
new
impulse
to
his
task
somehow
he
did
not
feel
like
crying
as
had
often
been
the
case
with
previous
trials
he
said
a
man
joel
kept
repeating
over
and
over
to
himself
while
the
words
of
his
lesson
swam
before
his
eyes
and
so
i
will
and
he
said
marks
had
got
to
make
me
as
mamsie
wanted
me
to
be
repeated
joel
to
himself
taking
a
shorter
cut
with
the
idea
and
so
i
will
be
and
he
leaned
his
elbows
on
the
table
bent
his
head
over
his
book
and
clutching
his
stubby
crop
by
both
hands
and
holding
on
tightly
he
was
soon
lost
to
his
misfortune
and
the
outside
world
hullo
david
stood
still
in
amazement
at
joel
unusual
attitude
over
his
lesson
then
he
reflected
that
he
was
making
up
extra
work
to
be
free
for
the
holiday
on
the
morrow
notwithstanding
the
need
of
quiet
david
was
so
full
of
it
that
he
could
refrain
from
saying
jubilantly
oh
what
a
great
time
we
have
joe
giving
him
a
pound
on
the
back
i
not
going
said
joel
without
raising
his
head
david
ran
around
his
chair
to
look
at
him
from
the
further
side
then
peered
under
the
bunch
of
curls
joel
was
hanging
to
what
what
the
matter
joe
he
gasped
clutching
the
table
marks
says
i
not
to
go
said
joel
telling
the
whole
at
once
marks
said
you
were
not
to
go
repeated
david
why
joel
why
he
demanded
in
a
gasp
i
have
studied
i
way
behind
let
me
alone
cried
joel
i
got
a
perfect
lot
to
make
up
and
he
clutched
harder
than
ever
at
his
hair
then
shall
not
go
declared
david
and
rushing
out
of
the
room
he
was
gone
before
joel
could
fly
from
his
chair
which
he
did
upsetting
it
after
him
dave
he
yelled
running
out
into
the
hall
in
the
face
of
a
stream
of
boys
coming
up
from
gymnasium
practice
what
up
pepper
but
he
went
through
their
ranks
like
a
shot
nevertheless
david
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
as
he
had
taken
some
short
cut
and
was
lost
in
the
crowd
joel
bent
his
steps
to
the
room
knocked
and
in
his
excitement
thought
he
heard
come
in
and
with
small
ceremony
he
precipitated
himself
upon
harrow
who
seemed
to
be
lost
in
a
revery
his
back
to
him
leaning
his
elbow
on
the
mantel
and
his
head
upon
his
hand
er
oh
exclaimed
harrow
startled
out
of
his
usual
composure
and
turning
quickly
to
face
joel
oh
it
you
pepper
which
by
no
means
lifted
him
out
of
his
depression
dave
says
he
wo
go
without
me
you
must
make
him
said
joel
in
his
intensity
forgetting
his
manners
to
moose
island
asked
harrow
joel
nodded
he
could
yet
bring
himself
to
speak
the
name
all
right
i
will
joe
harrow
grasped
the
brown
hand
hanging
by
joel
side
really
said
joel
swallowing
hard
really
run
back
to
your
books
and
trust
me
so
joel
dashed
back
not
minding
the
alluring
cries
from
several
chums
come
on
just
time
for
a
game
before
supper
and
was
back
before
his
table
in
the
same
attitude
and
hanging
to
his
hair
i
can
study
better
so
he
said
and
holding
on
for
dear
life
one
or
two
boys
glanced
in
come
out
of
this
hole
they
cried
no
need
to
study
for
gee
whiz
just
think
of
moose
island
joe
no
answer
joe
they
ran
in
and
shook
his
shoulders
moose
island
they
screamed
and
the
excitement
with
which
the
whole
school
was
charged
was
echoing
it
through
the
length
of
the
dormitory
go
away
cried
joel
at
them
or
i
fire
something
at
you
as
they
swarmed
around
his
chair
fire
your
old
grammar
suggested
one
trying
to
twitch
away
his
book
and
another
pulled
the
chair
out
from
under
him
joel
sprawled
a
moment
on
the
floor
then
he
sprang
up
hanging
to
his
book
and
faced
them
i
not
going
clear
out
and
in
a
moment
the
room
was
as
still
as
if
an
invasion
had
never
taken
place
in
their
astonishment
they
forgot
to
utter
a
word
and
in
ten
minutes
the
news
was
all
over
the
playground
and
in
all
the
corridors
joe
pepper
is
going
to
moose
island
if
they
had
said
that
the
corner
stone
of
the
dormitory
was
shaky
the
amazement
would
not
have
been
so
great
in
some
quarters
and
the
story
was
not
believed
until
they
had
it
from
joe
himself
then
amazement
changed
to
grief
not
to
have
joe
pepper
along
was
to
do
away
with
half
the
fun
percy
ran
up
to
him
in
the
greatest
excitement
just
before
supper
what
is
it
joe
he
cried
the
fellows
are
trying
to
say
that
you
not
going
to
moose
island
he
was
red
with
running
and
panted
dreadfully
and
van
is
giving
it
to
red
hiller
for
telling
such
a
whopper
well
he
need
said
joel
for
it
perfectly
true
i
not
going
percy
tried
to
speak
but
what
with
running
and
his
astonishment
his
tongue
flapped
up
idly
against
the
roof
of
his
mouth
marks
wo
let
me
said
joel
not
mincing
matters
i
got
to
study
so
there
an
end
of
it
but
when
davie
came
in
a
woe
begone
figure
for
harrow
had
kept
his
promise
then
was
joel
hardest
time
and
he
clenched
his
brown
hands
to
keep
the
tears
back
then
for
david
gave
way
to
such
a
flood
in
the
bitterness
of
his
grief
to
go
without
joel
that
for
a
time
joel
was
in
danger
of
utterly
losing
his
own
i
confounded
glad
it
was
jenk
who
said
it
to
his
small
following
and
hearing
it
tom
beresford
blazed
at
him
if
you
were
quite
so
small
i
knock
you
down
well
i
am
glad
jenk
put
a
goodly
distance
between
himself
and
tom
notwithstanding
tom
disgust
at
the
idea
of
touching
him
for
pepper
is
so
high
and
mighty
it
time
he
was
taken
down
but
a
chorus
of
yells
made
him
beat
a
retreat
marks
paced
up
and
down
his
study
floor
his
head
bent
his
hands
folded
behind
him
it
was
the
only
way
no
ordinary
course
could
be
taken
with
pepper
it
had
come
to
be
imperative
it
will
make
a
man
of
him
he
stepped
to
the
desk
and
wrote
a
few
words
slipped
them
into
an
envelope
sealed
and
addressed
it
joanna
he
went
to
the
door
and
summoned
a
maid
the
same
one
who
had
shaken
her
broom
at
joel
when
he
rushed
in
with
the
dog
take
this
over
to
the
north
dormitory
as
quickly
as
possible
it
seemed
to
be
especially
necessary
that
haste
be
observed
and
marks
usually
so
collected
hurried
to
the
window
to
assure
himself
that
his
command
was
obeyed
fox
took
the
note
as
joanna
handed
it
in
and
sent
it
up
at
once
as
those
were
the
orders
from
the
master
it
arrived
just
at
the
moment
when
joel
was
at
the
end
of
his
he
tore
it
open
my
boy
knowing
you
as
i
do
i
feel
sure
that
you
will
be
brave
in
bearing
this
it
will
help
you
to
conquer
your
dislike
for
study
and
make
a
man
of
you
affectionately
yours
l
marks
joel
swung
the
note
up
over
his
head
and
there
was
such
a
glad
ring
to
his
voice
that
david
was
too
astonished
to
cry
see
there
joel
proudly
shook
it
at
him
read
it
dave
so
david
seized
it
and
blinked
in
amazement
marks
has
written
to
me
said
joel
importantly
just
as
if
david
had
the
note
before
him
and
he
says
a
man
just
as
harrow
said
and
yours
now
what
do
you
think
of
that
dave
pepper
david
was
so
lost
in
the
honor
that
had
come
to
joel
that
the
grief
that
he
was
feeling
in
the
thought
of
the
expedition
to
be
made
to
moose
island
without
joel
began
to
pale
he
smiled
and
lifted
his
eyes
lately
so
wet
with
tears
mamsie
would
like
that
note
joe
tom
beresford
rushed
in
without
the
formality
of
a
knock
and
gloomily
threw
himself
on
the
bed
poor
joe
was
written
all
over
his
long
face
oh
you
need
tom
said
joel
gaily
and
prancing
up
and
down
the
room
pity
me
because
i
wo
have
it
it
pity
for
myself
as
well
said
tom
lugubriously
and
cramming
the
into
his
mouth
what
a
fellow
to
do
without
you
joe
suddenly
shying
the
pillow
at
joel
joe
caught
it
and
shied
it
back
then
twitched
the
master
note
out
of
david
hand
read
it
tom
he
cried
with
sparkling
eyes
i
much
rather
stay
back
with
you
joe
tom
was
saying
well
you
wo
retorted
joel
dave
tried
that
on
but
it
was
no
good
read
it
i
tell
you
so
tom
sat
up
on
the
bed
and
spread
marks
note
on
his
knee
great
cæsar
ghost
it
from
the
master
himself
and
what
does
he
say
tom
rubbed
his
eyes
violently
stared
and
rushed
over
the
few
sentences
pellmell
then
returned
to
take
them
slowly
to
be
sure
of
their
meaning
joe
pepper
he
got
off
from
the
bed
is
it
great
cried
joel
give
me
my
note
tom
i
should
say
so
cried
tom
bobbing
his
head
i
should
in
the
least
mind
being
kept
back
from
a
few
things
to
get
a
note
like
that
think
of
it
joe
from
dr
marks
i
know
it
cried
joel
in
huge
satisfaction
well
now
you
must
take
yourself
off
tom
i
got
to
study
like
a
trojan
he
ran
to
the
closet
and
came
back
with
his
arms
full
of
books
all
right
said
tom
shooting
out
then
he
shot
back
gave
joel
a
pat
by
no
means
a
light
one
success
to
you
old
fellow
and
was
off
this
time
for
good
and
davie
dreamed
that
night
that
joel
took
first
prize
in
everything
straight
through
and
that
he
himself
was
sailing
sailing
over
an
interminable
sea
going
to
moose
island
probably
under
a
ban
never
to
come
back
to
marks
school
and
the
first
thing
he
knew
joel
was
pounding
him
and
calling
lustily
get
up
dave
you
know
you
are
to
start
early
and
then
all
was
bustle
and
confusion
enough
as
how
could
it
be
helped
with
all
those
boys
getting
off
on
such
an
expedition
and
joel
was
the
brightest
of
them
all
here
there
and
everywhere
you
never
would
have
guessed
that
he
was
the
leading
spirit
in
the
whole
expedition
and
its
bright
particular
star
and
he
ran
down
to
the
big
stone
gate
to
see
them
off
and
the
boys
wondered
but
there
was
no
chance
to
pity
him
with
such
a
face
there
was
only
pity
for
themselves
and
somebody
started
three
cheers
for
joe
pepper
it
was
the
but
he
joined
with
a
right
good
will
and
the
whole
crowd
took
it
up
as
joel
ran
back
to
tackle
his
books
pinching
letter
in
his
pocket
to
make
sure
it
really
was
there
just
about
this
time
alexia
rhys
was
rushing
to
school
she
was
late
for
everything
had
gone
wrong
that
morning
from
the
very
beginning
and
of
course
polly
pepper
had
started
for
school
when
alexia
called
for
her
and
feeling
as
if
nothing
mattered
now
the
corner
was
reached
despairingly
when
she
heard
her
name
called
it
was
an
old
lady
who
was
a
friend
of
her
aunt
and
alexia
paused
involuntarily
then
ran
across
the
street
to
see
what
was
wanted
oh
my
dear
i
suppose
i
ought
not
to
stop
you
for
you
are
going
to
school
oh
it
does
matter
said
alexia
indifferently
i
late
anyway
what
is
it
miss
seymour
i
want
to
congratulate
you
i
congratulate
you
exclaimed
old
miss
seymour
with
an
excited
little
cackle
i
really
must
alexia
alexia
ran
over
in
her
mind
everything
for
which
she
could
by
any
possibility
be
congratulated
and
finding
nothing
she
said
what
for
quite
abruptly
oh
my
dear
have
you
heard
old
miss
seymour
put
her
jewelled
fingers
on
the
girl
shoulder
she
had
gathered
up
her
dressy
morning
robe
in
her
hand
and
hastened
down
her
front
steps
at
the
first
glimpse
of
alexia
across
the
way
alexia
knew
of
old
the
roundabout
way
pursued
by
her
aunt
friend
in
her
narrations
besides
she
cared
very
little
anyway
for
this
bit
of
old
women
gossip
so
she
said
carelessly
no
i
sure
i
have
and
i
do
believe
it
much
anyway
miss
seymour
anyway
oh
my
dear
old
miss
seymour
held
up
both
hands
well
what
would
you
say
if
you
should
be
told
that
your
teacher
was
going
to
be
married
alexia
staggered
backward
and
put
up
both
hands
oh
do
miss
seymour
she
cried
the
fears
she
had
been
lighting
so
many
weeks
now
come
true
then
she
burst
out
passionately
oh
it
is
true
it
be
well
but
it
is
cried
miss
seymour
positively
i
had
it
not
ten
minutes
since
from
a
very
intimate
friend
and
as
you
were
the
first
salisbury
girl
i
saw
why
i
wanted
to
congratulate
you
of
course
as
soon
as
i
could
salisbury
girl
alexia
groaned
as
she
thought
how
they
should
never
have
that
title
applied
to
them
any
more
for
of
course
the
beautiful
school
was
doomed
and
where
shall
we
all
go
she
cried
to
herself
in
despair
oh
how
could
she
go
and
get
engaged
she
exclaimed
aloud
you
have
asked
who
the
man
is
said
miss
seymour
in
surprise
oh
i
know
i
know
said
alexia
miserably
it
john
clemcy
oh
if
we
had
had
that
old
picnic
she
burst
out
eh
what
exclaimed
the
little
old
lady
quickly
never
mind
it
does
signify
who
the
man
is
it
does
signify
about
anything
said
alexia
wildly
as
long
as
miss
salisbury
is
going
to
get
married
and
give
up
our
school
oh
i
do
suppose
the
school
will
be
given
up
said
miss
seymour
what
why
of
course
it
will
be
how
can
she
keep
it
after
she
is
married
cried
alexia
impatiently
she
longed
to
say
you
goose
you
why
i
suppose
the
other
one
will
keep
it
of
course
and
it
will
go
on
just
the
same
as
it
did
before
oh
dear
me
the
idea
of
miss
anstice
keeping
that
school
with
all
her
misery
alexia
could
help
bursting
into
a
laugh
miss
anstice
yes
if
you
knew
her
as
we
girls
do
miss
seymour
you
never
say
she
could
run
that
school
i
never
said
she
could
oh
yes
you
did
alexia
was
guilty
of
contradicting
you
said
distinctly
that
when
miss
salisbury
was
married
you
supposed
miss
anstice
would
keep
it
on
just
the
same
little
old
miss
seymour
took
three
or
four
steps
down
the
pavement
then
turned
and
trotted
back
the
dressy
morning
robe
still
gathered
in
her
hand
who
do
you
think
is
engaged
to
john
clemcy
she
asked
looking
up
at
the
tall
girl
why
our
miss
salisbury
answered
alexia
ready
to
cry
i
suppose
that
what
you
said
oh
no
i
did
said
the
little
old
lady
it
miss
anstice
salisbury
alexia
gave
her
one
look
then
took
some
flying
steps
across
the
street
and
away
down
to
the
salisbury
school
she
met
a
stream
of
girls
in
the
front
hall
and
as
soon
as
she
saw
their
faces
she
knew
that
her
news
was
all
old
and
they
could
tell
her
something
more
miss
wilcox
is
going
to
be
the
assistant
teacher
cried
amy
garrett
and
miss
salisbury
announced
it
why
were
you
late
alexia
it
was
a
perfect
buzz
around
her
ears
and
then
she
dismissed
school
and
all
going
down
to
the
now
to
congratulate
miss
anstice
alexia
worked
her
way
to
polly
pepper
and
clung
to
her
oh
alexia
you
got
here
cried
polly
delightedly
and
only
think
we
can
keep
our
miss
salisbury
after
all
xxv
the
very
prettiest
affair
and
john
clemcy
having
put
off
any
inclination
to
marry
till
so
late
in
life
was
now
that
he
had
made
his
choice
in
a
ferment
to
hurry
its
consummation
and
miss
ophelia
who
was
still
to
keep
the
house
and
run
the
flower
garden
to
suit
herself
thus
losing
none
of
her
honors
and
being
in
her
element
as
has
been
stated
with
some
one
to
fuss
over
her
brother
not
yielding
her
sufficient
occupation
in
that
line
begged
that
the
wedding
might
take
place
soon
so
there
was
really
no
reason
on
earth
why
it
should
not
be
celebrated
and
miss
wilcox
be
installed
as
assistant
and
thus
all
things
be
in
running
order
for
the
new
year
at
the
salisbury
school
and
they
say
he
has
heaps
of
money
clemcy
has
cried
alexia
in
the
midst
of
the
excitement
of
the
next
few
days
when
everybody
was
trying
to
adjust
themselves
to
this
new
condition
of
affairs
a
lot
of
the
girls
were
up
in
polly
pepper
room
and
it
an
awful
old
family
back
of
him
in
england
she
went
on
though
for
my
part
i
rather
have
something
to
do
with
making
my
name
myself
oh
alexia
cried
clem
think
of
all
those
perfectly
elegant
old
family
portraits
mouldy
old
things
exclaimed
alexia
who
had
small
reverence
for
such
things
i
should
be
ashamed
of
them
if
i
were
john
clemcy
and
his
sister
they
do
look
as
if
they
knew
anything
to
begin
with
and
such
arms
and
hands
and
impossible
necks
oh
my
it
quite
gives
me
a
turn
to
look
at
them
we
are
quite
distinguished
the
salisbury
school
is
said
silvia
with
an
elegant
manner
and
a
toss
of
her
head
my
mother
says
it
will
be
splendid
capital
to
miss
salisbury
to
have
such
a
connection
and
oh
just
think
of
miss
anstice
engagement
ring
exclaimed
another
girl
oh
my
on
her
little
thin
finger
it
awful
cried
silvia
set
in
silver
but
then
big
and
a
pure
stone
my
mother
says
and
quite
shows
that
the
family
must
have
been
something
for
it
is
an
heirloom
oh
do
stop
about
family
and
heirlooms
cried
alexia
impatiently
the
main
thing
is
that
our
miss
salisbury
is
going
to
desert
us
miss
anstice
is
oh
goody
amy
garrett
hopped
up
and
down
and
softly
beat
her
hands
while
she
finished
the
sentence
hush
alexia
turned
on
her
suddenly
now
amy
and
the
rest
of
you
girls
i
think
we
ought
to
stop
this
nonsense
about
miss
anstice
going
and
i
maybe
have
treated
her
just
rightly
of
course
you
have
assented
clem
coolly
you
worried
her
life
nearly
out
of
her
and
oh
dear
me
i
sorry
now
said
alexia
not
minding
in
the
least
what
clem
was
saying
i
wonder
why
it
is
that
i
forever
being
sorry
about
things
because
you
forever
having
your
own
way
said
clem
i
tell
you
and
so
i
going
to
be
nice
to
her
now
said
alexia
with
a
perfectly
composed
glance
at
clem
let
all
be
girls
i
mean
behind
her
back
polly
pepper
ran
over
across
the
room
to
slip
her
arm
within
alexia
and
give
her
a
little
approving
pat
it
will
be
so
strange
not
to
make
fun
of
her
observed
amy
garrett
but
i
suppose
we
ca
now
anyway
that
she
is
to
be
john
clemcy
john
clemcy
indeed
exclaimed
alexia
standing
very
tall
she
was
just
as
nice
before
as
sister
of
our
miss
salisbury
i
have
you
to
know
girls
well
now
what
are
we
to
give
her
as
a
wedding
present
said
polly
pepper
you
know
we
as
the
committee
ought
to
talk
it
over
at
once
let
sit
down
on
the
floor
in
a
ring
and
begin
yes
said
alexia
now
all
flop
and
setting
the
example
she
got
down
on
the
floor
and
the
girls
tumbling
after
the
ring
was
soon
formed
hush
now
do
be
quiet
clem
if
you
can
cried
alexia
to
pay
up
old
scores
i
guess
i
not
making
as
much
noise
as
some
other
people
said
clem
with
a
wry
face
well
polly
going
to
begin
and
as
she
chairman
we
all
got
to
be
still
as
mice
hush
i
think
said
polly
the
best
way
would
be
instead
of
wasting
so
much
time
in
talking
and
getting
into
a
hubbub
interpolated
alexia
who
talking
now
cried
clem
triumphantly
and
making
a
noise
getting
in
confusion
finished
polly
would
be
for
us
each
to
write
out
the
things
that
miss
anstice
might
like
on
a
piece
of
paper
without
showing
it
to
any
of
the
other
girls
then
pass
them
in
to
me
and
i
read
them
aloud
and
perhaps
we
choose
something
out
of
all
the
lists
oh
polly
how
fine
just
the
thing
i
get
the
paper
and
the
pencils
the
ring
was
in
a
hubbub
alexia
as
usual
the
first
to
hop
out
of
her
place
sit
down
girls
said
polly
as
chairman
so
they
all
flew
back
again
there
you
see
now
said
alexia
huddling
expeditiously
into
her
place
next
to
polly
how
no
one
can
stir
till
the
chairman
tells
us
to
who
jumped
first
of
all
exclaimed
clem
bursting
into
a
laugh
well
i
back
again
anyhow
said
alexia
coolly
and
folding
her
hands
in
her
lap
i
appoint
lucy
bennett
and
silvia
horne
to
get
the
paper
and
pencils
said
polly
they
are
on
my
desk
girls
alexia
smothered
the
sigh
at
her
failure
to
be
one
of
the
girls
to
perform
this
delightful
task
but
the
paper
being
brought
she
soon
forgot
her
disappointment
in
having
something
to
do
we
must
all
tear
it
up
into
strips
said
the
chairman
and
beginning
on
a
sheet
lucy
you
can
be
giving
around
the
pencils
and
presently
the
whole
committee
was
racking
its
brains
over
this
terribly
important
question
thrust
upon
them
it
must
be
something
that
will
always
reflect
credit
on
the
salisbury
school
observed
alexia
leaning
her
chin
on
her
hand
while
she
played
with
her
pencil
ugh
do
be
still
lucy
on
the
other
side
nudged
her
i
ca
think
if
anybody
speaks
a
word
and
fit
in
well
with
those
old
portraits
said
clem
with
a
look
at
alexia
well
i
hope
and
pray
that
we
wo
give
her
anything
old
i
want
it
spick
span
new
and
to
be
absolutely
alexia
took
her
chin
out
of
her
hand
and
sat
up
decidedly
the
idea
of
matching
up
those
mouldy
old
portraits
and
that
house
just
bursting
with
antiques
ugh
do
hush
cried
the
girls
and
write
what
you
want
to
alexia
on
your
own
slip
and
keep
still
said
silvia
wrinkling
her
brows
you
just
put
something
out
of
my
head
and
it
was
perfectly
splendid
but
i
ca
think
of
a
thing
that
would
be
good
enough
grumbled
alexia
for
the
salisbury
school
to
give
oh
dear
me
and
she
regarded
enviously
the
other
pencils
scribbling
away
my
list
is
done
amy
garrett
pinched
hers
into
a
little
note
and
threw
it
into
polly
lap
and
mine
and
mine
they
all
came
in
fast
in
a
small
white
shower
oh
my
goodness
exclaimed
alexia
much
alarmed
that
she
would
be
left
out
altogether
wait
chairman
i
mean
polly
and
she
began
scribbling
away
for
dear
life
oh
dear
me
the
chairman
unfolded
the
first
strip
and
began
to
read
a
piano
why
girls
miss
anstice
ca
play
well
it
would
look
nice
in
that
great
big
said
clem
letting
herself
out
with
a
very
red
face
oh
my
you
wrote
alexia
went
over
backward
suddenly
to
lie
flat
on
the
floor
and
laugh
besides
there
is
one
in
that
house
an
old
thing
exclaimed
clem
in
disdain
well
let
see
here
something
nice
polly
ran
along
the
list
a
handsome
chair
a
desk
a
cabinet
those
are
fine
clem
has
gone
into
the
furniture
business
i
should
think
said
philena
and
a
cabinet
exclaimed
amy
garrett
when
that
house
is
just
full
of
oh
i
mean
a
jewel
cabinet
or
something
of
that
sort
explained
clem
hastily
that
not
bad
announced
silvia
for
i
suppose
he
give
her
all
the
rest
of
those
heirlooms
great
strings
of
pearls
probably
he
got
and
everything
else
dear
me
do
i
wish
we
girls
could
see
them
and
she
lost
herself
in
admiration
over
the
fabulous
clemcy
jewels
well
chairman
polly
i
mean
alexia
flew
into
position
what
the
next
list
this
is
quite
different
said
polly
unrolling
it
some
handsome
lace
a
fan
a
lorgnette
a
bracelet
it
easy
enough
to
see
that
silvia
said
alexia
all
that
finery
and
furbelows
well
it
not
fair
to
tell
what
you
think
and
guess
said
silvia
a
pink
spot
coming
on
either
check
make
any
difference
my
guessing
we
all
know
it
yours
silvia
said
alexia
coolly
well
i
think
that
a
lovely
list
said
amy
with
sparkling
eyes
and
i
for
one
would
be
willing
to
vote
for
any
of
those
things
my
mother
says
we
better
give
her
something
to
wear
said
silvia
smoothing
down
her
gown
miss
anstice
likes
nice
things
and
that
great
big
house
is
running
over
with
everything
to
furnish
with
polly
was
reading
the
third
list
so
somebody
pulled
alexia
arm
and
stopped
her
a
watch
and
chain
that
all
there
is
on
this
list
announced
polly
oh
there
was
a
chorus
of
voices
that
it
that
it
and
why
did
i
think
of
that
until
the
whole
ring
was
in
a
tumult
again
it
was
no
matter
what
was
on
the
other
lists
the
chairman
read
them
over
faithfully
but
the
items
fell
upon
dull
ears
they
might
make
suitable
tributes
for
other
brides
there
was
but
one
mind
about
the
present
for
this
particular
bride
going
forth
from
the
salisbury
school
the
watch
and
chain
was
the
only
gift
to
be
thought
of
and
she
wears
that
great
big
thing
declared
silvia
looks
like
a
turnip
oh
oh
and
i
do
believe
that
always
made
her
so
impressive
and
scarey
whenever
she
got
into
that
black
silk
gown
said
amy
garrett
i
never
thought
of
it
before
but
it
was
that
horrible
old
watch
and
chain
girls
said
the
chairman
i
do
really
believe
that
it
would
be
the
very
best
thing
that
we
could
possibly
give
her
and
now
i
going
to
tell
who
it
was
who
chose
it
do
oh
do
the
whole
ring
came
together
in
a
bunch
as
the
girls
all
crowded
around
polly
alexia
then
polly
turned
and
gave
a
loving
little
pat
on
the
long
back
do
said
alexia
shrinking
away
from
the
shower
of
congratulations
on
having
made
the
best
choice
and
thought
of
the
very
thing
that
was
likely
to
unite
the
whole
school
on
a
gift
it
nothing
i
help
but
write
it
it
was
the
only
thing
i
thought
of
well
it
was
just
as
clever
in
you
as
could
be
so
there
now
clem
nodded
over
at
her
and
buried
all
animosity
at
once
and
think
how
nice
it
will
be
when
it
all
engraved
inside
the
case
with
what
we
want
to
say
said
polly
with
shining
eyes
and
a
great
big
monogram
outside
said
silvia
with
enthusiasm
and
one
of
those
twisted
chains
oh
how
fine
she
shook
out
her
silver
bracelets
till
they
jingled
all
her
enthusiasm
and
the
entire
committee
joining
the
vote
was
taken
to
propose
to
the
rest
of
the
salisbury
girls
on
the
morrow
the
gift
of
a
watch
and
chain
to
the
future
john
clemcy
and
the
watch
and
chain
was
unanimously
chosen
by
the
salisbury
girls
as
the
gift
of
all
gifts
they
wanted
to
bestow
upon
their
teacher
on
her
wedding
day
and
they
all
insisted
that
polly
pepper
should
write
the
inscription
so
there
it
was
engraved
beautifully
on
the
inner
side
of
the
case
anstice
salisbury
with
the
loving
regard
of
her
pupils
and
there
was
a
beautiful
big
monogram
on
the
outside
and
the
long
chain
was
double
and
twisted
and
so
handsome
that
silvia
mother
protested
she
had
a
word
to
say
but
the
very
highest
praise
oh
and
the
presentation
of
it
came
about
quite
differently
from
what
was
expected
after
all
for
the
gift
was
to
be
sent
with
a
little
note
representing
the
whole
school
and
written
as
was
quite
proper
by
polly
pepper
the
chairman
of
the
committee
but
miss
salisbury
to
whom
the
precious
parcel
had
been
intrusted
said
suddenly
why
do
you
give
it
to
her
yourselves
girls
it
was
of
course
the
place
of
the
chairman
of
the
committee
to
speak
so
polly
said
oh
would
she
like
to
have
us
miss
salisbury
yes
my
dears
i
know
she
would
she
feels
badly
to
go
and
leave
you
all
you
know
and
there
were
tears
in
the
blue
eyes
that
always
looked
so
kindly
on
them
and
it
would
be
a
very
lovely
thing
for
you
to
do
if
you
would
like
to
we
should
to
do
it
cried
polly
warmly
may
we
go
now
dear
miss
salisbury
yes
said
miss
salisbury
very
much
pleased
she
is
in
the
red
parlor
so
the
committee
filed
into
the
red
parlor
there
sat
miss
anstice
and
oh
dear
me
mr
john
clemcy
there
was
no
time
to
retreat
for
miss
salisbury
not
having
heard
clemcy
come
in
was
at
the
rear
of
the
procession
of
girls
here
my
dears
anstice
the
girls
particularly
want
to
see
you
oh
and
then
she
saw
john
clemcy
miss
anstice
who
seemed
to
have
dropped
all
her
nervousness
lately
saved
the
situation
by
coming
forward
and
greeting
them
warmly
and
when
john
clemcy
saw
how
it
was
he
went
gallantly
to
the
rescue
and
was
so
easy
and
genial
and
that
the
committee
presently
felt
as
if
a
good
part
of
their
lives
had
been
passed
in
making
presentations
and
that
they
were
quite
up
to
that
sort
of
thing
and
polly
made
a
neat
little
speech
as
she
handed
her
the
packet
and
miss
anstice
eyes
filled
with
tears
of
genuine
regret
at
leaving
them
and
of
delight
at
the
gift
girls
do
you
know
could
it
be
miss
anstice
who
was
talking
with
so
much
feeling
in
her
voice
i
used
to
imagine
that
you
did
love
me
oh
that
could
never
be
cried
clemcy
and
i
got
so
worried
and
cross
over
it
but
now
i
know
you
did
and
that
i
was
simply
tired
for
i
never
could
teach
like
sister
she
cast
her
a
loving
glance
and
i
did
really
love
my
work
and
do
you
know
the
thing
i
longed
for
all
my
life
was
a
watch
and
chain
like
this
oh
girls
i
shall
love
it
always
she
threw
the
chain
around
her
neck
and
laid
the
little
watch
gently
against
her
cheek
oh
it
was
alexia
who
pressed
forward
you
forgive
us
all
you
miss
anstice
if
we
did
love
you
enough
when
i
want
to
forgive
i
look
at
my
dear
watch
said
miss
anstice
brightly
and
smiling
on
them
all
was
that
horrible
old
black
silk
gown
that
made
her
so
exclaimed
alexia
as
they
all
tumbled
off
down
the
hall
in
the
greatest
excitement
you
see
how
sweet
she
is
now
in
that
white
one
and
the
red
rose
in
her
belt
said
clem
and
her
diamond
ring
added
silvia
and
we
different
too
said
clem
maybe
we
would
love
to
teach
a
lot
of
girls
any
better
either
if
we
had
to
well
and
now
there
the
wedding
exclaimed
amy
garrett
clasping
her
hands
oh
what
richness
finished
alexia
and
everybody
said
it
was
the
very
prettiest
affair
and
so
picturesque
and
those
dear
salisbury
girls
how
sweet
they
looked
to
be
sure
why
john
blossomed
out
like
a
veritable
garden
just
with
that
blooming
company
of
girls
to
say
nothing
of
the
exquisite
flowers
and
ropes
of
laurel
and
palms
and
the
broad
white
satin
ribbons
to
divide
the
favored
ones
from
the
mere
acquaintances
and
what
a
lovely
thought
to
get
those
boys
from
the
pemberton
school
for
ushers
with
jasper
king
as
their
leader
they
all
made
such
a
bright
youthful
picture
to
be
followed
by
the
chosen
eight
of
the
salisbury
girls
the
very
committee
who
presented
the
gift
to
the
there
they
were
in
their
simple
white
gowns
and
big
white
hats
and
then
came
the
little
assistant
teacher
of
the
salisbury
school
in
her
pearl
gray
robe
singularly
enough
not
half
so
much
embarrassed
as
she
had
often
been
in
walking
down
the
long
schoolroom
before
the
girls
and
john
clemcy
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
as
embarrassment
at
all
but
stood
up
in
his
straightforward
manly
english
composure
to
take
his
vows
that
bound
him
to
the
little
and
miss
salisbury
fairly
resplendent
in
her
black
velvet
gown
had
down
deep
within
her
heart
a
childlike
satisfaction
in
it
all
dear
anstice
was
happy
and
somehow
the
outlook
for
the
future
with
miss
wilcox
for
assistant
teacher
was
restful
for
one
whose
heart
and
soul
were
bound
up
in
her
pupils
advancement
miss
ophelia
clemcy
blossomed
out
from
her
retirement
and
became
quite
voluble
in
the
front
pew
before
the
wedding
procession
arrived
you
see
it
was
foreordained
to
be
she
announced
as
she
had
before
declared
several
times
to
the
principal
of
the
salisbury
school
the
first
moment
he
saw
her
brother
john
was
fully
convinced
that
here
was
a
creature
of
the
greatest
sensibility
and
altogether
charming
and
my
dear
miss
salisbury
i
am
only
commonplace
and
practical
you
know
so
it
is
all
as
it
should
be
and
suits
me
perfectly
and
we
will
always
keep
the
anniversary
of
that
picnic
that
blessed
day
wo
we
and
old
king
invited
the
eight
ushers
from
the
pemberton
school
and
the
committee
from
the
salisbury
school
to
a
little
supper
to
top
off
the
wedding
festivities
and
grandpapa
sat
at
the
head
of
the
table
with
mother
fisher
at
the
other
end
and
fisher
and
whitney
opposite
in
the
centre
and
there
were
wedding
toasts
and
little
speeches
and
everybody
got
very
jolly
and
festive
and
the
little
doctor
looked
down
to
the
table
end
where
he
could
see
his
wife
eyes
it
reminds
me
very
much
of
our
own
wedding
day
wife
his
glance
said
and
she
smiled
back
in
such
a
way
as
to
fill
him
with
great
content
and
was
that
reception
in
the
school
parlors
too
perfectly
beautiful
for
anything

polly
pepper
in
a
lull
for
about
the
fiftieth

it
all
over
