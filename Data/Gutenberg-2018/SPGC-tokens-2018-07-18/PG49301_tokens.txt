of
well
do
i
mind
the
first
time
that
ever
i
was
in
the
heartsome
town
of
ballantrae
my
father
seldom
went
thither
because
it
was
a
hold
of
the
bargany
folk
and
it
argued
therefore
sounder
sense
to
give
it
the
but
it
came
to
pass
upon
a
time
that
it
was
necessary
for
my
father
to
adventure
from
kirrieoch
on
the
border
of
galloway
where
we
dwelt
high
on
the
moors
to
the
seaside
of
ayr
my
father
s
sister
had
married
a
man
named
hew
grier
an
indweller
in
maybole
who
for
gear
s
sake
had
settled
down
to
his
trade
of
tanner
in
ballantrae
it
was
to
his
burying
that
we
went
we
had
seen
him
snugly
happed
up
and
the
burial
supper
was
over
we
were
already
in
a
mind
to
set
about
returning
when
we
heard
the
sound
of
a
great
rushing
of
people
hither
and
thither
i
went
aloft
and
looked
through
a
gable
window
upon
the
street
arms
were
hastily
being
brought
from
beneath
the
thatch
to
which
the
laws
of
the
king
had
committed
them
under
the
late
ordinance
anent
weapons
of
war
leathern
jackets
were
being
donned
and
many
folk
cried
bargany
in
the
streets
without
knowing
why
my
aunt
grisel
went
out
to
ask
what
the
stir
might
be
and
came
in
again
with
her
face
as
white
as
a
clout
it
is
the
cassillis
folk
that
are
besieging
the
tower
of
ardstinchar
and
they
have
come
near
to
the
taking
of
it
they
say
oh
what
will
the
folk
of
ballantrae
do
to
you
john
if
they
ken
that
you
are
here
they
will
hang
you
for
a
spy
and
that
without
that
said
my
father
is
surely
impossible
the
ballantrae
folk
never
had
any
great
haul
of
sense
ever
since
stinchar
water
ran
but
yet
they
will
hardly
believe
that
hew
grier
decent
that
was
your
marrow
and
lies
now
in
his
resting
grave
poor
on
himself
to
die
just
that
i
might
come
to
ballantrae
to
spy
out
the
land
but
my
aunt
being
easily
flustered
would
not
hearken
to
him
thinking
that
all
terrible
things
were
possible
and
so
hid
the
two
of
us
in
the
till
it
should
be
the
hour
of
the
gloaming
then
so
soon
as
the
darkening
came
putting
a
flask
of
milk
into
my
pocket
and
giving
a
noble
satchel
of
cakes
to
my
father
she
almost
pushed
us
out
of
her
back
door
to
this
day
i
remember
how
the
unsteady
glare
of
a
red
burning
filled
all
the
street
and
we
could
see
burghers
wives
standing
at
their
doors
all
looking
intently
in
the
direction
of
the
castle
of
ardstinchar
upon
its
lofty
rock
others
set
their
heads
out
of
the
little
round
that
opened
in
each
gable
wall
and
gossiped
shrilly
with
their
neighbours
my
father
and
i
went
cannily
down
by
the
riverside
and
as
soon
as
we
turned
s
corner
we
saw
all
the
noble
tower
of
ardstinchar
flaming
to
the
window
belching
fire
and
the
sparks
fleeing
upward
as
before
a
mighty
wind
though
it
was
a
stirless
night
with
a
moon
and
stars
floating
serenely
above
down
by
the
waterside
and
straight
before
us
we
saw
a
post
of
men
and
we
heard
them
clank
their
as
they
marched
from
side
to
side
and
looked
ever
up
at
the
castle
on
its
steep
spitting
like
a
furnace
flaming
like
a
torch
so
at
sight
of
them
my
father
turned
us
about
sharply
enough
because
in
spite
of
what
he
had
said
to
my
aunt
grisel
he
had
much
reason
to
fear
for
his
neck
for
if
on
the
night
of
a
cassillis
raid
one
of
the
hated
faction
should
be
found
in
the
town
of
ballantrae
little
doubt
there
was
but
that
a
long
tow
and
a
short
shrift
would
be
his
fate
we
climbed
the
breast
of
the
brae
up
from
the
waterside
intending
to
make
a
detour
behind
the
castle
my
father
said
that
there
would
be
an
easy
crossing
at
heronford
where
he
knew
a
decent
man
that
was
of
his
own
party
thence
we
could
make
up
the
glen
of
the
tigg
water
which
in
the
evil
state
of
the
country
was
as
good
and
quiet
a
way
back
to
minnochside
as
one
might
hope
to
find
it
seemed
a
most
pitiful
sight
to
me
that
was
but
a
young
lad
and
had
never
seen
a
fire
bigger
than
a
screed
of
muirburn
screeving
across
the
hills
with
a
following
wind
at
its
tail
to
watch
the
noble
house
with
all
its
wealth
of
plenishing
and
gear
being
burned
up
i
said
as
much
to
my
father
who
swung
along
with
his
head
bent
to
the
hill
slope
dragging
my
arm
oftentimes
almost
from
the
socket
in
his
haste
to
get
us
out
of
such
unwholesome
company
as
the
angry
folk
of
ballantrae
it
is
an
enemy
s
house
he
replied
very
hastily
come
thy
ways
lad
but
what
harm
have
the
bargany
folk
done
to
us
i
asked
for
this
thing
seemed
strange
to
kennedy
should
strive
with
kennedy
burn
castle
kill
man
harry
mow
and
manger
drive
i
never
be
able
to
make
out
what
it
was
all
for
hold
your
breath
launcelot
kennedy
said
my
father
testy
with
shortness
of
wind
and
going
uphill
or
right
speedily
you
will
find
out
for
what
is
it
not
enough
that
you
are
born
to
love
cassillis
and
to
hate
bargany
are
the
folk
of
cassillis
then
so
much
better
than
the
folk
of
bargany
i
asked
taking
what
i
well
knew
to
be
the
chances
of
a
civil
answer
or
of
a
ring
on
the
side
of
the
head
it
was
not
the
civil
answer
that
i
got
and
indeed
it
was
an
ill
season
for
query
and
question
or
for
the
answering
of
them
in
time
we
got
to
the
angle
of
the
castle
and
there
we
were
somewhat
sheltered
from
the
fierce
heat
and
from
the
glare
of
light
also
from
the
eminence
we
had
gained
we
could
look
away
along
the
shore
side
my
father
pointed
with
his
finger
boy
do
you
see
yon
he
whispered
i
looked
long
and
eagerly
with
my
unaccustomed
eyes
before
i
could
see
in
the
pale
moonlight
a
dark
train
of
horsemen
that
rode
steadily
northward
their
line
wimpled
like
a
serpent
being
pricked
out
to
our
sight
with
little
reeling
twinkles
of
fire
which
i
took
to
be
the
moon
shining
on
their
armour
and
the
points
of
their
spears
see
said
my
father
yonder
goes
our
good
earl
home
with
the
spoil
would
that
i
were
by
his
side
why
do
i
live
so
far
among
the
hills
and
out
of
the
call
of
my
chief
when
he
casts
his
war
pennon
to
the
winds
we
looked
all
round
the
castle
and
seeing
no
one
we
made
shift
to
get
about
it
and
darn
ourselves
among
the
heather
of
the
further
hillside
but
even
as
we
passed
the
angle
and
reached
a
broken
part
of
the
wall
there
came
a
trampling
of
hoofs
and
lo
a
troop
of
horsemen
rode
up
to
the
main
castle
gate
that
which
looks
to
the
it
was
all
we
could
do
to
clamber
out
of
sight
over
the
broken
wall
my
father
lifting
me
in
his
arms
there
we
lay
flat
and
silent
behind
a
pile
of
stones
just
where
the
breach
had
been
which
we
could
look
into
the
courtyard
and
see
the
splotched
causeway
and
the
bodies
of
the
dead
lying
here
and
there
athwart
it
in
the
ruddy
light
of
burning
just
as
the
foremost
horseman
came
to
the
gate
which
the
riders
of
cassillis
had
left
wide
open
the
roof
of
red
tile
fell
in
with
an
awesome
crash
the
flames
again
sprang
high
and
the
sparks
soared
soon
all
the
courtyard
was
aglow
with
the
red
unsteady
leme
which
the
skies
gave
back
while
the
moon
and
stars
paled
and
went
out
hist
whispered
my
father
this
is
young
bargany
himself
who
comes
i
looked
eagerly
from
behind
a
stone
and
saw
the
noblest
figure
of
a
young
man
that
ever
i
saw
or
shall
see
riding
on
a
black
horse
sitting
framed
in
the
dark
of
the
gateway
the
flames
making
a
crimson
flicker
about
him
after
a
moment
s
pause
he
rode
within
the
deserted
close
and
there
sat
his
horse
looking
up
sternly
and
silently
at
the
leaping
flames
and
hearkening
as
it
were
to
the
crackling
of
the
timbers
as
they
burned
then
another
and
yet
another
horseman
came
riding
within
some
of
whom
my
father
knew
see
you
launce
and
remember
he
whispered
that
loon
there
is
thomas
kennedy
of
drummurchie
bargany
s
brother
observe
his
fangs
of
the
wolf
he
of
all
the
crew
is
the
wickedest
and
the
i
looked
forth
and
saw
a
gaunt
dark
youth
with
a
short
upper
lip
drawn
up
from
teeth
that
shone
white
in
the
leaping
flame
which
harvested
the
goodly
gear
of
the
house
of
ardstinchar
there
also
is
blairquhan
the
simpleton
cloncaird
of
the
black
heart
and
benane
the
laird
s
very
debauched
there
i
declare
is
my
lord
ochiltree
upon
soul
and
conscience
i
wonder
what
he
does
here
thus
riding
with
the
barganies
as
soon
as
the
fire
died
down
a
little
some
of
the
party
began
to
search
about
among
the
defences
and
outhouses
and
a
few
even
entered
into
the
inner
part
of
the
tower
in
twos
and
threes
they
came
forth
some
bringing
a
wounded
man
some
a
dead
man
till
on
the
cool
grey
stones
of
the
court
there
rested
five
that
lay
motionless
on
their
backs
and
two
that
moaned
a
while
and
then
were
still
the
more
lightly
wounded
were
cared
for
in
a
chamber
within
the
gate
then
we
could
see
all
the
gentlemen
of
the
bargany
side
dismounted
from
their
horses
and
standing
about
those
five
that
were
killed
alas
for
young
girvanmains
i
heard
one
cry
for
we
were
very
near
what
shall
we
say
to
his
father
and
here
also
is
walter
pollock
the
cunning
james
dalrymple
that
was
a
kindly
little
man
and
never
harmed
lord
do
so
to
me
and
more
also
if
i
write
not
this
killing
in
blood
upon
the
walls
of
cassillis
the
crowd
thinned
a
little
and
i
saw
it
was
the
laird
himself
that
spoke
then
this
same
young
bargany
who
was
taller
by
a
head
than
any
there
called
for
room
so
they
made
a
ring
with
the
dead
men
in
the
midst
and
bargany
standing
a
little
before
he
bent
him
over
the
body
of
walter
pollock
the
young
clerk
and
drew
forth
a
book
from
his
breast
listen
he
cried
all
you
that
love
bargany
and
who
now
behold
this
deed
of
dule
and
cruelty
here
lie
our
dead
here
is
the
book
of
god
that
i
have
taken
from
one
of
the
servants
of
peace
cruelly
bereft
of
life
by
our
enemies
i
warrant
he
drew
a
good
sword
when
it
came
to
the
fighting
clerk
though
he
might
be
whispered
my
father
i
know
the
pollock
breed
bargany
looked
at
the
book
in
his
grasp
and
again
at
the
hand
which
had
held
it
this
falls
out
well
he
said
here
in
the
presence
of
our
dead
upon
the
bible
that
is
wet
with
the
blood
of
the
unjustly
slain
let
us
band
ourselves
together
and
take
oath
to
be
avenged
upon
the
cruel
house
of
house
that
has
ever
wrought
us
woe
will
ye
swear
he
looked
round
a
circle
of
faces
that
shone
fierce
and
dark
in
the
lowe
of
the
furnace
beyond
as
he
did
so
he
unsheathed
his
sword
and
pointed
with
it
to
the
topmost
pinnacles
of
ardstinchar
in
a
moment
there
was
a
ring
of
steel
all
about
him
for
quick
as
his
own
every
man
s
hand
went
out
to
his
scabbard
and
in
every
man
s
grip
there
gleamed
a
bare
blade
and
the
sight
thrilled
me
to
see
it
ay
more
than
all
the
religion
i
had
ever
been
taught
for
i
was
but
a
boy
and
even
though
religion
be
learned
in
youth
the
strength
and
the
use
of
it
comes
not
till
after
thus
bargany
stood
with
the
brand
in
his
right
hand
and
the
bible
in
his
left
to
take
as
was
ancient
custom
in
our
countryside
the
solemn
oath
of
vengeance
and
eternal
enmity
and
thus
he
spake
by
this
holy
book
and
by
the
wet
blood
upon
it
i
gilbert
kennedy
of
bargany
swear
never
to
satisfy
my
just
feud
against
the
bloody
house
of
cassillis
till
of
all
their
defenced
towers
there
stands
not
one
stone
in
its
place
remains
alive
not
one
scion
of
its
cruel
race
i
who
stand
here
in
the
presence
of
these
dead
men
of
my
folk
charge
the
kennedies
of
the
north
with
the
blood
of
my
kin
the
spoiling
of
my
vassals
and
the
of
my
father
in
the
name
of
god
i
swear
if
i
stay
my
hand
and
make
not
an
end
the
god
of
battles
do
so
to
me
and
more
also
gilbert
kennedy
kissed
the
book
which
he
gripped
in
his
left
hand
and
then
with
sudden
gesture
of
hatred
he
flung
down
the
sword
which
he
had
held
aloft
in
his
right
it
fell
with
a
ringing
dirl
of
iron
upon
the
stones
of
the
pavement
beside
the
slain
men
and
the
sound
of
its
fall
made
the
flesh
creep
on
my
bones
then
the
laird
s
wicked
brother
thomas
called
the
wolf
of
drummurchie
came
forward
hatred
fairly
sparkling
in
his
eyes
and
his
teeth
set
in
a
girn
of
devil
s
anger
i
swear
he
cried
to
harry
john
of
cassillis
the
enemy
that
has
wrought
us
this
woe
with
fire
and
cut
off
him
and
his
with
dagger
and
spear
to
light
the
thack
and
to
lift
the
cattle
i
will
be
an
outlaw
a
prey
for
the
hunters
for
their
sake
for
cassillis
it
was
who
first
slandered
me
to
the
king
chased
me
from
my
home
and
made
me
no
better
than
a
robber
man
upon
the
and
in
turn
he
kissed
the
book
and
his
sword
rang
grimly
on
the
pavement
beside
his
brother
s
so
one
by
one
the
men
of
bargany
took
the
solemn
band
of
eternal
and
bloody
feud
presently
an
old
man
stood
forth
he
held
a
spear
in
his
hand
being
as
my
father
whispered
but
a
tenant
vassal
and
keeping
to
the
ancient
scottish
yeoman
s
weapon
by
the
blood
of
my
son
that
lies
here
before
me
by
this
spear
which
he
held
in
his
dying
hand
i
that
am
but
the
poor
goodman
of
girvanmains
before
death
takes
me
to
where
all
vengeance
is
another
s
i
swear
the
vengeance
of
blood
and
he
cast
the
spear
beside
the
swords
of
the
gentlemen
then
issuing
forth
from
the
chamber
over
the
gate
and
leaning
heavily
upon
the
arm
of
a
young
page
boy
there
came
creeping
the
strangest
shape
of
a
countenance
thrawed
and
drawn
his
shrunk
shanks
twisted
his
feet
wambling
one
over
another
like
those
of
a
mummer
s
bear
bowed
double
the
man
was
and
he
walked
with
a
staff
that
tapped
and
rattled
tremblingly
on
the
pavement
as
he
came
the
men
of
war
turned
at
the
sound
for
there
had
been
stark
silence
among
them
after
old
girvanmains
had
let
his
spear
fall
like
one
risen
from
the
dead
the
old
man
looked
up
at
the
tower
which
was
now
beginning
to
show
black
against
the
dulling
red
glow
of
the
dying
fire
thou
tower
of
ardstinchar
he
cried
lifting
up
a
voice
like
the
wind
whistling
through
scrannel
pipes
they
have
burned
you
that
erstwhile
burned
me
curse
me
cassillis
and
the
lords
of
it
curse
me
all
that
cleave
to
it
for
their
tender
mercies
are
cruel
i
allan
stewart
sometime
abbot
of
crossraguel
lay
my
curse
bitterly
upon
them
for
the
cruel
burning
they
gave
me
before
their
fire
in
the
black
vault
of
dunure
but
bless
me
the
house
of
bargany
that
rescued
me
from
torture
and
took
me
to
their
strong
tower
wherein
i
have
to
this
day
found
in
peace
a
quiet
abiding
mark
well
boy
whispered
my
father
remember
this
to
tell
it
in
after
days
to
your
children
s
children
your
eyes
have
seen
the
abbot
of
crossraguel
whom
the
king
of
carrick
the
father
of
our
earl
john
roasted
quick
in
the
vault
of
deed
which
has
wrought
mickle
woe
and
will
yet
work
and
even
as
my
father
spoke
i
saw
the
old
cripple
hirple
away
the
young
laird
himself
helping
him
with
the
kindliest
courtesy
then
last
of
all
that
spake
came
a
voice
from
one
who
had
remained
in
the
gloomy
archway
of
the
gate
by
the
entering
in
of
the
courtyard
he
that
broke
the
silence
was
a
tall
man
who
sat
on
a
grey
horse
and
was
clad
from
head
to
foot
in
a
cloak
of
grey
having
his
face
shaded
with
a
hat
of
the
ancient
fashion
give
me
the
book
and
i
also
will
swear
an
oath
he
said
in
a
voice
which
made
all
turn
towards
him
who
may
that
man
be
i
ken
him
not
said
my
father
for
he
had
named
all
the
others
as
they
came
within
so
one
gave
the
man
the
bible
and
he
held
it
in
his
hand
a
moment
he
was
silent
a
space
before
he
spoke
by
this
christian
book
and
among
this
christian
people
he
cried
i
swear
to
root
out
and
slay
utterly
all
the
house
of
cassillis
and
culzean
pursuing
them
man
woman
and
child
with
fire
and
sword
till
they
die
the
death
of
pain
and
scorn
or
i
who
swear
die
in
the
accomplishing
of
the
unknown
paused
at
the
end
of
this
terrible
oath
and
gazed
again
at
the
book
the
dying
flame
within
the
castle
flared
up
for
a
chance
moment
as
another
rafter
caught
fire
fauch
said
he
of
the
grey
cloak
looking
at
the
bible
in
his
hand
there
is
blood
upon
thee
go
thou
into
the
burning
as
the
seal
of
our
oaths
a
bloody
bible
is
no
christian
book
and
with
that
he
threw
the
bible
into
the
red
embers
that
glowed
sullenly
within
the
tower
there
broke
a
cry
of
horror
from
all
that
saw
for
though
in
this
dark
land
of
carrick
deeds
of
blood
were
done
every
day
this
was
accounted
rank
blasphemy
and
ungodly
sacrilege
but
i
was
not
prepared
for
its
effect
upon
my
father
he
trembled
in
all
his
limbs
and
i
felt
the
stones
shake
upon
which
he
now
leaned
breast
high
careless
who
should
see
him
this
is
fair
devil
s
work
he
muttered
the
fires
of
sodom
the
brimstone
of
gomorrah
shall
light
upon
us
all
for
this
deed
he
would
have
said
more
but
i
never
heard
him
finish
his
words
sudden
as
a
springing
deer
he
tore
from
the
covert
of
the
wall
by
my
side
and
bounded
across
the
court
threading
the
surprised
group
and
overleaping
the
swords
and
the
bodies
of
the
slain
men
he
disappeared
in
a
moment
through
the
door
into
the
tower
within
which
the
flames
still
glowed
red
and
from
which
every
instant
the
crash
of
falling
timber
and
the
leaping
flames
answered
each
other
ere
my
father
sprang
back
his
figure
stood
plain
and
dark
against
the
fire
within
like
that
of
a
smith
at
his
forge
seen
in
the
bygoing
upon
a
snowy
night
he
held
the
unburned
bible
clasped
to
his
breast
but
his
left
hand
hung
straight
down
by
his
side
a
moment
after
he
had
sprung
from
a
window
and
fallen
upon
his
face
on
the
pavement
with
the
bible
beneath
him
a
dozen
men
ran
towards
him
and
seized
of
drummurchie
the
first
among
them
a
traitor
a
spy
he
cried
lifting
a
sword
from
the
pile
with
clear
purpose
to
kill
to
the
death
with
him
it
is
john
kennedy
of
ken
him
well
a
rank
cassillis
thief
and
he
would
have
slain
my
father
forthwith
but
that
i
ran
among
his
legs
and
gripped
him
so
close
to
me
that
he
fell
clattering
on
the
pavement
among
the
swords
then
i
went
and
took
my
father
s
hand
standing
by
his
side
and
crying
out
the
while
ye
shallna
ye
shallna
kill
my
father
he
never
did
ye
harm
a
the
days
o
his
life
who
are
you
and
what
do
you
here
asked
young
bargany
in
a
voice
of
command
when
they
had
set
my
father
on
his
feet
i
am
john
kennedy
of
kirrieoch
on
minnochside
and
i
came
to
ballantrae
to
bury
the
corpse
of
my
sister
s
man
hew
grier
merchant
and
indweller
there
that
was
this
day
laid
in
the
so
right
quietly
and
calmly
my
father
spoke
among
them
all
but
what
seek
you
in
my
burned
castle
of
ardstinchar
and
alone
with
these
dead
men
asked
the
young
bargany
with
a
quietness
that
came
of
the
hills
my
father
told
the
chieftain
his
plain
tale
and
his
words
were
not
words
that
any
man
could
gainsay
then
bargany
answered
him
without
consulting
the
others
as
none
but
a
great
chief
does
whose
lightest
word
is
life
or
death
ye
are
here
within
my
danger
and
had
i
been
even
as
your
folk
of
cassillis
ye
should
have
died
the
death
but
because
ye
stopped
devil
s
work
and
it
may
be
kept
away
a
curse
from
us
for
the
burning
of
the
holy
book
ye
shall
not
die
in
my
house
take
your
life
and
your
son
s
life
as
a
gift
from
gilbert
kennedy
of
my
father
bowed
his
head
and
thanked
his
house
s
enemy
bring
a
horse
cried
the
laird
and
immediately
they
set
my
father
on
a
beast
and
me
in
the
saddle
before
him
put
the
bible
for
a
keepsake
in
your
winnock
sole
turn
out
the
steed
on
minnochside
and
come
no
more
to
ballantrae
in
time
of
feud
lest
a
worse
thing
befall
you
so
said
he
and
waved
us
away
as
i
thought
grandly
some
of
the
men
that
had
sworn
enmity
murmured
behind
him
silence
he
cried
am
not
i
lord
of
bargany
shall
i
not
do
as
i
will
take
your
life
kirrieoch
and
whenever
a
bargany
rides
by
your
door
ye
shall
give
him
bite
and
sup
for
the
favour
that
was
this
night
shown
you
in
the
courtyard
of
ye
shall
get
that
bargany
and
welcome
whether
ye
let
me
gang
or
no
said
my
father
and
pressing
the
book
to
his
bosom
and
gathering
up
the
reins
in
his
unwounded
hand
we
rode
unquestioned
through
the
arch
of
the
wall
into
the
silence
of
the
night
and
the
hill
winds
and
the
stillnesses
without
were
like
god
s
blessing
about
us
but
from
a
knoll
on
the
left
of
the
entrance
the
man
of
the
grey
habit
he
who
had
thrown
the
bible
sat
silent
upon
his
horse
and
watched
and
as
we
looked
back
he
still
sat
and
watched
him
my
father
took
to
have
been
the
devil
as
he
said
to
me
many
times
that
night
ere
we
got
to
minnochside
also
ere
we
left
the
clattering
pavement
behind
looking
out
from
the
postern
door
we
saw
the
thrawn
visage
of
him
who
was
allan
stewart
the
tortured
residue
of
the
man
who
had
once
been
abbot
of
crossraguel
and
in
stature
like
a
tower
and
this
is
the
way
my
father
brought
home
the
burnt
bible
to
the
house
of
kirrieoch
there
it
bides
to
this
day
blackened
as
to
its
bindings
and
charred
at
the
edges
but
safe
in
the
wall
press
at
my
father
s
a
famous
book
in
all
the
land
even
as
far
as
glencaird
and
dranie
manors
upon
the
waters
of
trool
but
it
brought
good
fortune
with
fortune
which
god
be
thanked
still
remains
and
grows
and
as
for
my
father
he
never
lifted
sword
nor
spear
against
the
house
of
bargany
from
that
day
to
this
because
of
the
usage
which
gilbert
kennedy
gave
him
that
night
at
the
burning
of
ardstinchar
nevertheless
for
all
that
he
exercised
me
tightly
in
the
use
of
every
weapon
of
war
from
the
skill
of
the
bow
to
the
shooting
of
the
hackbutt
for
it
was
his
constant
intent
to
make
me
an
esquire
in
the
service
of
sir
thomas
kennedy
of
culzean
reputed
the
wisest
man
and
the
best
soldier
in
all
the
parts
of
carrick
and
ayr
as
indeed
i
have
found
him
culzean
is
pronounced
culayne
as
though
to
rhyme
with
and
this
saving
of
the
burning
bible
was
as
i
guess
the
beginning
of
my
respect
for
alas
i
fear
this
chronicle
will
show
to
have
been
both
a
and
a
crop
lass
of
the
white
now
as
the
manner
is
i
must
make
haste
to
tell
something
of
myself
and
have
by
with
it
my
name
is
launcelot
kennedy
and
i
alone
am
the
teller
of
this
tale
in
a
country
where
all
are
kennedies
friends
and
foes
alike
this
name
of
mine
is
no
great
so
launcelot
of
the
spurs
i
am
called
or
sometimes
by
those
who
would
taunt
me
launcelot
but
for
all
that
i
come
of
a
decent
muirland
house
the
kennedies
of
kirrieoch
who
were
ever
lovers
of
the
cassillis
blue
and
are
the
royal
colours
of
france
in
memory
of
the
ancient
ever
haters
of
the
red
and
white
of
bargany
which
we
hold
no
better
than
butchers
colours
bloody
and
desolate
the
story
or
at
least
my
own
part
in
it
properly
begins
upon
the
night
of
the
fair
at
to
my
shame
i
had
gone
without
troubling
my
master
sir
thomas
kennedy
of
culzean
with
the
slight
matter
of
asking
his
permission
indeed
none
so
much
as
knew
that
i
had
been
to
the
town
of
maybole
save
helen
kennedy
alone
and
she
as
i
well
knew
although
i
called
her
clattertongue
would
not
in
any
wise
tell
tales
upon
me
there
at
the
fair
i
had
spent
all
my
silver
buying
of
at
the
and
about
the
but
upon
my
return
i
meant
to
divide
fairly
with
helen
kennedy
though
she
was
fully
two
years
younger
than
only
sixteen
years
of
her
age
though
i
grant
long
of
the
leg
and
a
good
runner
so
being
advised
of
my
excellent
intentions
you
shall
judge
if
i
was
not
justified
of
all
that
i
did
to
be
revenged
on
the
girl
afterwards
it
was
the
early
morning
of
a
march
day
when
i
came
to
the
foot
of
the
castle
of
culzean
i
went
with
quiet
steps
along
the
shore
by
the
little
path
that
leads
to
the
coves
beneath
i
carried
the
things
that
i
had
bought
in
a
napkin
all
tied
safely
together
now
the
towers
of
culzean
are
builded
upon
a
cliff
steep
and
perilous
overlooking
the
sea
and
i
being
but
a
squire
of
eighteen
though
for
my
age
strong
and
bold
and
not
to
be
beaten
by
anything
or
feared
by
any
man
was
lodged
high
up
in
the
white
tower
which
rises
from
the
extremest
point
of
the
rock
now
as
i
say
i
had
not
made
mention
of
the
little
matter
of
my
going
abroad
to
sir
thomas
both
because
it
was
unnecessary
to
trouble
him
with
so
small
a
thing
and
also
on
account
of
the
strictness
of
his
opinions
it
was
therefore
the
more
requisite
that
i
should
regain
my
chamber
without
putting
lazy
gilbert
in
the
at
the
gate
to
the
trouble
of
letting
fall
the
drawbridge
for
me
i
did
not
indeed
desire
to
disturb
or
disarrange
him
for
he
would
surely
tell
his
master
being
well
called
gabby
because
he
came
of
a
race
that
never
in
their
lives
has
been
able
to
hold
a
secret
for
a
single
day
in
the
belly
of
least
not
if
it
meant
money
ale
or
the
goodwill
of
their
lord
so
it
happened
that
before
i
went
to
maybole
i
dropped
a
ladder
of
rope
from
the
stanchions
of
my
window
extremely
strong
and
convenient
which
came
down
to
a
ledge
someway
up
among
the
rocks
at
a
place
which
i
could
easily
reach
by
climbing
thither
i
made
my
way
while
as
i
tell
you
the
night
was
just
beginning
to
dusk
toward
the
dawning
i
had
all
my
buyings
in
my
arms
tied
up
well
and
that
tightly
in
the
napkin
just
as
i
had
carried
them
from
the
of
maybole
i
tied
the
outer
knot
of
my
bundle
firmly
to
the
last
rung
of
the
ladder
praying
within
me
that
sir
thomas
might
be
fast
asleep
for
i
had
to
pass
within
three
feet
of
his
window
and
being
an
old
man
he
was
somewhat
wakerife
in
the
mornings
easily
started
and
given
to
staring
out
of
his
lattice
without
method
or
sense
in
a
manner
which
had
often
filled
me
with
pain
and
foreboding
for
his
reason
but
by
the
blessing
of
god
and
because
he
was
somewhat
tired
with
walking
in
the
fields
with
his
the
night
before
it
happened
that
sir
thomas
was
sound
asleep
so
that
i
was
nothing
troubled
with
him
but
immediately
beneath
me
in
the
white
tower
were
the
rooms
of
his
two
daughters
marjorie
and
helen
kennedy
and
of
these
helen
s
room
was
to
the
front
so
that
my
rope
ladder
passed
immediately
in
front
of
her
window
while
the
chamber
of
marjorie
was
to
the
back
and
in
this
instance
concerned
me
not
at
all
so
as
i
scrambled
up
the
swinging
ladder
and
indeed
there
are
not
many
that
would
venture
as
much
on
a
cold
march
morning
i
passed
helen
kennedy
s
window
as
i
went
by
the
devil
as
i
take
it
prompted
me
to
scratch
with
my
toe
upon
the
leaden
frame
of
her
lattice
for
the
lass
was
mortally
afraid
of
ghosts
so
i
pictured
to
myself
that
hearing
the
noise
at
the
window
she
would
take
it
for
the
scraping
of
an
evil
spirit
trying
to
find
a
way
in
and
forthwith
draw
the
clothes
over
her
head
and
lie
trembling
pleasing
myself
therefore
with
this
picture
i
scraped
away
and
laughed
within
myself
till
i
nearly
fell
from
the
ladder
presently
i
heard
a
stirring
within
the
chamber
and
stopped
to
listen
she
has
her
head
under
the
clothes
by
now
i
said
to
myself
as
i
climbed
on
up
to
my
own
window
which
i
found
unhasped
even
as
i
had
left
it
i
entered
gripping
the
edge
of
the
broad
sill
and
lifting
myself
over
with
ease
being
very
strong
of
the
forearm
indeed
i
had
won
a
prize
for
wrestling
at
the
fair
that
day
in
spite
of
my
thing
which
i
intended
to
keep
secret
till
helen
kennedy
should
begin
to
taunt
me
with
being
but
a
boy
and
feckless
it
chanced
however
that
i
who
had
been
thus
victorious
with
men
older
than
myself
was
now
to
be
vanquished
conquered
and
overset
by
one
who
was
two
years
younger
and
she
a
lassie
then
being
safe
in
my
chamber
i
began
to
pull
up
the
ladder
of
cords
with
all
my
goods
and
chattels
tied
at
the
end
of
it
and
my
thoughts
were
already
running
on
the
good
things
and
comfits
sweetmeats
some
bottles
of
canary
wine
and
for
the
adorning
of
my
person
when
i
rode
latter
not
for
pride
of
which
i
have
none
but
in
order
that
i
might
ride
in
good
squirely
fashion
and
as
became
the
gentleman
attendant
of
so
great
a
lord
as
sir
thomas
kennedy
of
culzean
tutor
of
cassillis
brother
of
the
late
and
uncle
of
the
present
earl
of
that
name
i
drew
up
my
rope
ladder
all
softly
and
with
success
because
from
the
stanchions
it
swung
clear
of
the
walls
of
the
castle
for
the
reason
that
my
turret
jutted
a
little
way
over
as
is
the
custom
with
towers
of
that
architecture
and
so
all
went
well
till
my
bundle
came
opposite
the
window
of
helen
kennedy
s
room
there
it
was
suddenly
caught
and
gripped
tight
so
that
i
could
in
no
wise
pull
it
further
nevertheless
i
wrestled
with
it
so
strongly
even
as
i
had
done
with
grown
men
at
maybole
that
the
cord
suddenly
gave
way
and
what
with
the
stress
and
pith
of
pulling
i
fell
on
my
back
hitting
my
head
upon
one
of
the
low
of
my
little
chamberlet
this
made
me
very
angry
indeed
but
i
leave
you
to
judge
how
much
more
angered
i
was
when
i
found
that
the
cords
of
my
rope
ladder
had
been
cleanly
severed
with
a
knife
and
that
my
bundle
and
all
it
contained
had
been
most
foully
stolen
from
me
i
looked
out
of
the
window
rubbing
my
sore
head
the
while
with
my
hand
nell
kennedy
i
called
as
loudly
as
i
dared
you
are
nothing
but
a
thief
and
a
mean
thief
the
lass
put
her
head
out
of
the
window
and
looked
up
at
me
so
that
her
hair
hung
down
and
i
saw
the
soft
lace
ruffle
of
her
night
apparel
it
was
long
and
swayed
in
the
wind
being
of
a
golden
yellow
colour
the
hair
i
am
speaking
of
not
by
r
lady
the
bedgown
mistress
helen
kennedy
from
you
sirrah
if
you
please
she
said
what
may
be
the
business
upon
which
squire
launce
spurheel
ventures
to
address
his
master
s
daughter
besom
said
i
taking
no
heed
of
her
tauntings
thief
give
me
back
my
bundle
my
heart
was
hot
within
me
for
indeed
i
had
intended
to
share
everything
with
her
in
the
morning
if
only
she
would
be
humble
enough
and
come
with
me
into
the
cove
now
there
is
nothing
more
angering
than
thus
to
be
baulked
on
the
threshold
of
a
generous
action
and
indeed
i
was
not
given
to
the
doing
of
any
other
often
enough
frustrated
of
my
intention
by
the
illsetness
of
others
thou
wast
a
noble
ghost
spurheel
she
cried
mocking
me
i
heard
thee
laughing
brave
frightener
of
girls
well
i
forgive
thee
for
it
is
a
good
bundle
of
excellent
devices
that
thou
hast
carried
for
me
all
the
way
from
the
fair
at
maybole
everything
that
i
craved
for
is
here
saving
the
brown
wrought
with
french
pastry
and
with
little
black
raisins
for
the
eyes
which
i
heard
of
yesterday
i
am
glad
i
ate
that
by
the
way
i
said
in
order
to
have
some
amends
of
her
for
indeed
there
was
no
such
thing
in
the
fair
at
least
so
far
ar
i
saw
may
it
give
thee
twisty
thraws
and
sit
ill
on
thy
stomach
spurheel
she
cried
up
at
me
for
at
sixteen
she
was
more
careless
of
her
speech
than
a
herd
on
the
hill
when
his
dogs
are
not
working
sweetly
nevertheless
she
spoke
as
though
she
had
been
saying
something
pleasant
and
by
its
nature
agreeable
to
hear
for
i
do
not
deny
that
the
lass
was
sometimes
others
not
to
me
and
that
upon
occasion
she
could
demean
herself
as
became
a
great
lady
which
indeed
she
was
and
when
no
one
was
by
then
i
took
no
ill
tongue
from
her
but
gave
as
good
as
i
got
or
maybe
a
kenning
better
i
could
hear
her
at
the
window
below
taking
the
packages
out
of
the
bundle
ye
have
good
taste
in
the
choice
of
cakes
she
said
coming
to
the
window
again
the
sweetmeats
are
most
excellent
the
pastry
melts
in
the
as
she
looked
out
she
munched
one
of
the
comfits
i
had
bought
for
my
own
eating
at
culzean
we
had
but
plain
beef
and
double
ale
but
no
lack
of
these
also
puddings
black
and
white
see
it
flakes
tenderly
being
well
readied
she
cried
up
at
me
flipping
it
with
the
forefinger
of
her
right
hand
to
show
its
delicate
lightness
she
held
the
cake
in
order
to
eat
it
in
the
palm
of
her
left
hand
at
which
being
angered
past
enduring
i
took
up
an
ornament
of
wood
which
had
fallen
from
the
back
of
an
oak
chair
and
threw
it
at
her
but
she
ducked
quickly
within
so
that
it
went
clattering
on
the
rocks
beneath
she
looked
out
again
she
said
mocking
me
with
her
mouth
remember
you
are
not
shooting
at
a
rantipole
cockshy
at
maybole
give
me
my
property
i
replied
with
some
dignity
and
firmness
else
in
the
morning
i
will
surely
tell
your
ay
ay
cried
she
even
tell
him
about
maybole
fair
and
coming
home
through
the
wood
with
your
arm
round
the
waist
of
bonny
kate
allison
the
grieve
s
lass
he
will
be
most
happy
to
hear
of
that
and
of
the
other
things
you
have
been
doing
all
the
night
also
to
be
thy
father
confessor
and
set
thee
penance
for
thy
deed
it
is
a
lie
i
said
angry
that
nell
kennedy
should
guess
so
discomfortably
near
to
the
truth
what
is
a
lie
most
sweet
and
youth
she
queried
with
a
voice
like
mistress
pussie
s
velvet
paws
the
matter
you
have
spoken
concerning
the
grieve
s
lass
i
care
nothing
for
girls
and
i
spoke
the
the
indeed
there
were
things
bypast
that
i
was
now
sorry
for
she
went
in
and
explored
further
in
my
bundle
while
i
stood
at
the
upper
window
above
and
miscalled
her
over
the
window
sill
as
loudly
as
i
dared
every
little
while
she
ran
to
the
window
to
examine
something
for
the
light
was
now
coming
broad
from
the
east
and
flooding
the
sea
even
to
the
far
blue
mountains
of
arran
and
cantyre
hatbands
all
broidered
with
silk
she
cried
was
ever
such
grandeur
known
in
this
place
of
culzean
they
will
do
bravely
for
me
and
besides
they
will
save
thy
back
from
the
hangman
and
the
whip
for
thou
spurheel
art
not
of
the
quality
to
wear
such
but
they
will
do
excellently
for
the
pearling
and
ribboning
of
a
baron
s
daughter
nevertheless
heartily
do
i
applaud
your
taste
in
taffeta
spurheel
and
let
that
be
a
comfort
to
was
there
ever
such
a
wench
i
said
to
myself
stamping
my
foot
in
anger
last
of
all
nell
brought
to
the
window
the
three
bottles
of
canary
wine
for
which
i
had
paid
so
dear
what
is
this
she
cried
with
her
head
at
the
side
in
her
masterful
way
what
is
this
wine
wine
of
water
rather
i
warrant
to
be
sold
in
a
booth
at
a
fair
at
any
rate
wine
is
not
good
for
boys
she
added
and
such
drabbled
stuff
is
not
for
the
drinking
of
a
thou
like
it
spurheel
she
ducked
in
thinking
that
i
was
about
to
throw
something
more
at
indeed
i
scorned
to
do
besides
having
nothing
convenient
to
my
hand
look
you
squire
launce
she
said
again
crying
from
the
window
without
setting
her
head
out
you
are
something
of
a
marksman
they
say
there
never
was
a
nonsuch
like
our
spurheel
s
own
estimation
but
i
can
outmark
him
fix
your
eye
on
yon
black
rock
with
the
tide
just
coming
over
two
and
and
in
a
moment
one
of
my
precious
bottles
of
wine
played
clash
on
samson
s
reef
two
hundred
feet
below
the
white
tower
i
was
fairly
dancing
now
with
anger
and
threatened
to
come
down
my
rope
ladder
to
be
even
with
her
indeed
i
made
the
cord
ready
to
throw
myself
out
of
the
window
to
clamber
down
but
even
as
i
did
so
the
glaiked
maiden
sent
the
other
two
jars
of
canary
to
keep
company
with
the
first
then
she
leaned
out
and
looked
up
sweetly
holding
the
sash
of
the
window
meantime
in
her
hand
you
are
going
to
visit
my
father
in
the
morning
doubtless
and
tell
him
all
about
the
bundle
and
the
grieve
s
lass
good
speed
and
my
blessing
she
cried
making
ready
to
shut
the
window
and
draw
the
bolt
i
am
going
to
sleep
in
marjorie
s
room
the
gulls
are
beginning
to
sing
i
love
not
to
hear
or
theirs
but
i
leave
you
to
guess
who
it
was
that
felt
himself
the
greater
gull
second
taunting
of
now
i
shall
ever
affirm
that
there
was
not
in
all
this
realm
of
scotland
since
the
young
queen
mary
came
out
of
whom
our
grandfathers
yet
make
boast
and
rise
from
their
chairs
with
their
natural
strength
unabated
as
they
lovely
a
maid
as
marjorie
kennedy
the
elder
of
the
two
remaining
daughters
of
sir
thomas
the
tutor
of
cassillis
ever
since
i
came
to
the
house
of
culzean
i
could
have
lain
down
gladly
and
let
her
walk
over
even
when
i
was
but
a
boy
and
much
more
when
i
grew
nigh
to
eighteen
and
had
all
the
heart
and
some
of
the
experience
of
a
man
in
the
things
of
love
and
how
the
lairds
and
knights
came
her
ay
even
belted
earls
like
glencairn
and
eglintoun
but
marjorie
gave
them
no
more
than
the
bend
of
a
scornful
head
or
the
waft
of
a
white
hand
for
she
had
a
way
with
her
that
moved
men
s
brains
to
a
very
fantasy
of
desire
for
myself
i
declare
that
when
she
came
down
and
walked
in
the
garden
i
became
like
a
little
waggling
puppy
dog
so
great
was
my
desire
to
attract
her
attention
yet
she
spoke
to
me
but
seldom
being
of
a
nature
as
noble
as
it
was
reserved
silent
and
grave
marjorie
kennedy
mostly
was
with
the
lustre
of
her
eyes
turned
more
often
on
the
far
sea
edges
than
on
the
desirable
young
men
who
rode
their
horses
so
gallantly
over
the
greensward
to
the
landward
gate
of
culzean
but
it
is
not
of
marjorie
kennedy
whom
with
all
my
heart
i
worshipped
and
do
worship
spite
of
all
that
i
have
at
this
time
most
to
tell
it
happened
on
this
day
that
late
in
the
afternoon
sir
thomas
my
master
came
out
of
the
chamber
where
ordinarily
he
did
his
business
and
commanded
me
to
prepare
his
arms
and
also
bid
the
grooms
have
the
horses
ready
for
us
two
only
at
seven
of
the
clock
that
will
be
just
at
the
darkening
i
said
for
i
thought
it
a
strange
time
to
be
setting
forth
when
the
country
was
so
unsettled
with
the
great
feud
between
the
kennedies
of
cassilis
and
the
young
laird
of
bargany
and
his
party
just
at
the
darkening
he
made
answer
very
shortly
indeed
as
though
he
would
have
minded
me
that
the
time
of
departure
was
no
business
of
indeed
it
was
not
so
i
oiled
and
snapped
the
pistolets
and
saw
that
the
swords
moved
easily
from
their
sheaths
thereafter
i
prepared
my
own
hackbutt
and
set
the
match
ready
in
my
belt
i
was
ever
particular
about
my
arms
and
of
those
of
my
lord
as
well
for
i
prided
myself
on
never
having
been
faulted
in
the
performing
of
my
duty
however
much
i
might
slip
in
other
matters
that
touched
not
mine
honour
as
a
soldier
once
or
twice
as
i
rubbed
or
caressed
the
locks
with
a
feather
and
fine
oil
thereon
i
was
aware
of
a
foot
moving
along
the
passage
without
i
knew
well
that
it
was
the
lassie
helen
anxious
as
i
judged
to
make
up
the
quarrel
or
perhaps
with
yet
more
evil
in
her
heart
wishful
to
try
my
temper
worse
than
before
presently
she
put
her
head
within
the
door
but
i
stood
with
my
back
to
her
busy
with
my
work
at
the
window
i
would
not
so
much
as
look
up
indeed
i
cared
nothing
about
the
matter
one
way
or
the
other
for
why
should
a
grown
man
and
a
soldier
care
about
the
glaiks
and
of
a
lassie
of
sixteen
she
stayed
still
by
the
door
a
moment
waiting
for
me
to
notice
her
but
i
did
not
whereat
at
last
she
spoke
ye
are
a
great
man
this
day
spurheel
she
said
tauntingly
did
ye
rowell
your
leg
yestreen
to
waken
ye
in
time
to
bring
hame
the
grieve
s
lassie
i
may
as
well
tell
the
origin
now
of
the
name
spurheel
by
which
at
this
time
she
ordinarily
called
me
it
was
a
nothing
and
it
is
indeed
not
worth
the
telling
it
chanced
that
for
my
own
purpose
i
desired
to
wake
one
night
at
a
certain
time
and
because
i
was
a
sound
sleeper
i
tied
a
spur
to
my
heel
thinking
that
with
a
little
touch
i
should
waken
as
i
turned
over
but
in
the
night
i
had
a
dream
i
dreamed
that
the
foul
fiend
himself
was
riding
me
and
i
kicked
so
briskly
to
dismount
him
that
i
rowelled
myself
most
cruelly
thus
i
was
found
in
the
morning
lying
all
naked
having
gashed
myself
most
monstrously
with
the
spur
which
has
been
a
against
me
with
silly
people
ever
since
now
this
is
the
whole
tale
why
i
was
called
spurheel
and
in
it
there
was
no
word
of
the
grieve
s
kate
allison
was
a
bonny
lass
too
and
that
i
will
maintain
in
spite
of
all
the
gibes
of
helen
kennedy
i
will
bring
you
the
spoons
and
the
boots
also
to
clean
she
said
and
the
courtyard
wants
sweeping
in
this
manner
she
often
spoke
to
me
as
if
i
had
been
a
menial
because
when
i
did
my
squire
s
duty
with
the
weapons
and
the
armour
i
would
not
let
her
so
much
as
touch
them
which
she
much
desired
to
do
for
she
was
by
nature
as
curious
about
these
things
as
a
boy
so
for
show
and
bravery
i
tried
the
edge
of
my
own
sword
on
the
back
of
my
hand
nell
kennedy
laughed
aloud
hairs
on
the
back
of
a
bairn
s
hand
quoth
she
better
try
your
carving
knife
instead
on
the
back
of
a
horse
s
currying
comb
but
i
knew
when
to
be
silent
and
she
got
no
satisfaction
out
of
me
and
that
was
ever
the
better
way
of
it
with
her
when
i
could
sufficiently
command
my
temper
to
follow
mine
own
best
counsel
so
the
afternoon
wore
on
and
before
it
was
over
i
had
time
to
go
out
into
the
fields
and
also
towards
evening
to
the
to
recreate
myself
i
played
sundry
games
with
james
and
alexander
kennedy
good
lads
enough
but
ever
better
at
that
ball
play
which
has
no
powder
behind
it
at
the
gloaming
the
horses
were
ready
and
accoutred
for
the
expedition
the
tutor
of
cassillis
and
i
rode
alone
as
was
his
great
was
his
trust
in
my
courage
and
discretion
though
my
years
were
not
many
and
i
grant
it
the
hairs
yet
few
on
my
chin
it
was
still
march
and
the
bitter
winter
we
had
had
seemed
scarcely
to
have
blown
itself
out
so
that
although
the
crows
had
a
week
before
been
carrying
sticks
for
their
nesting
in
the
woods
of
culzean
yet
now
in
the
dark
the
snowflakes
were
again
whirling
and
spreading
ere
they
reached
the
ground
as
we
rode
through
the
courtyard
and
out
at
the
gate
i
heard
the
soft
of
a
foot
behind
us
for
i
have
a
good
ear
i
heard
it
even
through
the
clatter
of
the
hoofs
of
our
war
horses
so
i
turned
in
my
saddle
and
there
behind
us
was
that
madcap
lass
nell
kennedy
with
her
wylicoats
kilted
and
a
snowball
in
her
hand
which
she
manifestly
designed
to
throw
at
me
but
even
as
i
ducked
my
head
the
ball
flew
past
me
and
hit
sir
thomas
s
horse
ailsa
on
the
rump
making
him
curvet
to
the
no
small
discomfort
of
the
rider
what
was
that
think
ye
launcelot
my
master
asked
in
his
kindly
way
it
might
have
been
a
bat
i
made
it
was
at
least
no
use
bringing
the
lassie
into
the
affair
in
spite
of
what
she
had
done
to
me
that
morning
besides
i
could
find
out
ways
of
paying
my
debts
to
her
without
the
telling
of
tales
and
that
was
always
one
comfort
it
is
a
queer
time
of
year
for
bats
answered
sir
thomas
doubtfully
but
he
rode
on
and
said
no
more
i
kept
behind
him
ducking
my
head
and
appearing
to
be
in
terror
of
another
snowball
for
the
ground
was
now
whitening
fast
nell
kennedy
followed
after
making
her
next
ball
harder
by
pressing
it
in
her
hand
so
we
went
till
we
came
to
the
far
side
of
the
drawbridge
and
were
ready
to
plunge
into
the
woodlands
then
i
gave
the
whistle
which
tells
that
all
is
well
on
the
landward
side
and
is
the
signal
for
the
bridge
to
be
raised
gabby
heard
and
obeyed
quickly
as
he
was
wont
to
do
when
his
master
was
not
far
away
at
other
times
he
was
lazy
as
the
hills
the
bridge
went
grinding
up
and
therefore
the
would
immediately
as
i
knew
stretch
himself
for
a
sleep
by
the
fire
so
there
i
had
mistress
nell
on
the
landward
side
of
the
drawbridge
and
the
gate
up
with
the
snow
dancing
down
on
her
bare
head
and
her
coats
kilted
for
mischief
i
lagged
a
little
behind
sir
thomas
so
that
i
could
say
to
nell
whose
spirits
were
somewhat
dashed
by
the
raising
of
the
bridge
step
down
to
the
water
side
and
bring
up
the
three
bottles
of
canary
or
go
over
to
the
farm
and
keep
the
grieve
s
lass
company
she
may
perchance
be
so
waving
my
hand
and
laughing
i
rode
off
and
left
her
alone
i
hoped
that
she
cried
for
my
heart
was
hot
within
me
because
of
the
good
things
on
which
i
had
expended
all
my
saving
and
which
i
had
in
all
kindliness
meant
to
share
with
her
yet
we
had
not
reached
the
great
oak
in
the
park
before
she
was
again
by
my
side
think
ye
i
canna
gang
up
the
ladder
in
the
white
tower
as
well
as
you
spurheel
it
is
just
kilting
my
coats
a
kennin
higher
and
i
could
have
bitten
my
fingers
off
that
i
had
forgotten
to
pull
it
in
again
to
my
chamber
for
in
the
morning
i
had
mended
and
dropped
it
not
knowing
when
it
might
be
needed
inn
on
the
red
and
now
to
tell
of
sterner
business
for
havering
with
a
lass
bairn
about
a
great
house
is
but
small
part
of
the
purpose
of
my
i
can
take
pleasure
in
that
also
when
it
chances
to
come
my
way
as
indeed
becomes
a
soldier
we
rode
on
some
miles
through
the
woods
it
still
snowed
and
straying
flakes
disentangled
themselves
from
among
the
branches
and
sprinkled
us
sparsely
it
grew
eerie
as
the
night
closed
in
and
we
heard
only
the
roar
of
the
wind
above
us
the
leafless
branches
clacking
against
one
another
like
the
bones
of
dead
men
it
was
not
my
place
to
ask
whither
we
were
going
but
it
may
be
believed
that
i
was
anxious
enough
to
learn
we
struck
into
the
moorland
road
which
climbs
over
the
red
moss
in
the
direction
of
the
hill
that
is
called
brown
carrick
the
snow
darkness
settled
down
and
but
that
once
i
had
been
friendly
with
a
lass
who
lived
in
that
direction
and
so
was
accustomed
to
night
travel
in
these
parts
i
should
scarce
have
known
whither
we
were
going
but
i
understood
that
it
could
only
be
to
the
lonesome
inn
of
the
red
moss
kept
by
black
peter
that
culzean
was
making
his
way
as
we
began
to
climb
the
moor
sir
thomas
motioned
me
with
his
hand
to
ride
abreast
of
him
and
to
make
ready
my
weapons
which
i
was
not
loth
to
do
for
i
am
no
nidderling
to
be
afraid
of
powder
when
at
last
we
came
to
the
inn
of
the
red
moss
there
were
lights
shining
in
the
windows
and
looking
out
ruddy
and
lowering
under
the
thatch
of
the
eaves
it
was
ever
an
uncanny
spot
and
so
it
was
more
than
ever
now
but
for
all
that
the
red
moss
was
populous
as
a
bees
byke
that
night
for
men
and
horses
seemed
fairly
to
swarm
about
it
yet
there
was
no
jovial
crying
or
greeting
between
man
and
man
such
as
one
may
hear
any
market
day
upon
the
plainstones
of
ayr
the
men
who
were
meeting
thus
by
dark
of
night
were
mostly
men
of
position
come
together
upon
a
dangerous
and
unwholesome
ploy
as
soon
as
i
saw
the
quality
of
the
gentlemen
who
were
assembled
i
knew
that
we
had
come
to
a
gathering
of
the
heads
of
the
cassillis
faction
nor
was
it
long
before
i
saw
my
lord
himself
a
tall
young
man
inclining
to
stoutness
and
of
a
fair
complexion
with
flaxen
hair
the
laird
of
culzean
my
master
lighted
down
and
took
the
earl
by
the
hand
asking
in
his
kindly
way
is
it
well
with
you
john
for
in
his
minority
he
had
been
his
tutor
and
governor
and
in
after
years
had
agreed
well
with
him
which
is
not
so
common
ay
well
with
me
replied
the
earl
but
it
is
that
dotard
fool
kelwood
who
has
gotten
the
chest
of
gold
and
jewels
which
in
my
father
s
time
was
stolen
from
the
house
of
cassillis
by
archibald
bannatyne
who
was
my
father
s
man
he
died
in
my
father
s
hands
who
was
not
a
cat
to
draw
a
straw
before
nevertheless
even
in
the
black
vault
of
dunure
he
could
not
be
brought
to
reveal
where
he
had
hidden
the
chest
but
now
kelwood
or
another
for
him
has
gotten
it
from
archie
s
widow
a
poor
woman
that
knew
not
its
but
kelwood
will
deliver
it
john
is
he
not
your
man
trouble
not
any
more
about
the
matter
counselled
the
tutor
who
was
ever
for
the
milder
opinion
and
very
notably
wise
as
well
as
slow
in
judgment
nay
said
the
earl
deliver
it
he
will
not
for
bargany
and
auchendrayne
have
gotten
his
ear
and
he
has
set
his
mansion
house
in
defence
against
us
i
have
called
you
here
tutor
for
your
good
advice
shall
we
levy
our
men
and
beset
kelwood
or
how
shall
we
proceed
that
i
may
recover
that
which
is
most
justly
mine
own
for
it
was
ever
the
bitterest
draught
to
the
earl
to
lose
siller
or
gear
the
tutor
stood
for
a
moment
by
his
beast
s
neck
holding
his
head
a
little
to
one
side
in
a
way
he
had
when
he
was
considering
trick
which
his
daughter
nell
has
also
how
many
are
ye
here
he
said
to
the
earl
we
are
fifteen
the
earl
replied
all
gentlemen
again
asked
the
tutor
all
cadets
of
mine
own
house
and
ready
to
fight
to
the
death
for
the
blue
and
gold
replied
the
earl
giving
a
cock
to
the
bonnet
in
the
side
of
which
he
had
the
lilies
of
france
upon
a
rosette
of
blue
velvet
which
at
that
time
was
the
cassillis
badge
of
war
as
the
earl
spoke
i
who
stood
a
little
behind
with
my
finger
on
the
cock
of
my
pistol
saw
my
lord
raise
a
questioning
eyebrow
at
me
as
if
to
ask
his
uncle
who
the
young
squire
might
be
whom
he
had
brought
with
him
he
is
the
son
of
john
kennedy
of
kirrieoch
and
with
us
to
the
death
said
my
master
for
which
most
just
speech
i
thanked
him
in
my
heart
the
name
is
a
good
one
said
the
earl
with
a
little
quaintish
smile
and
well
might
he
say
so
for
it
was
his
own
and
my
father
of
as
good
blood
as
he
albeit
of
a
younger
branch
presently
we
were
riding
forth
again
seventeen
men
in
our
company
for
the
earl
had
not
counted
the
tutor
and
myself
in
his
numeration
we
rode
clattering
and
careless
over
the
moors
by
unfrequented
tracks
or
no
track
at
all
as
we
went
i
could
hear
them
talking
ever
about
the
treasure
of
kelwood
and
in
especial
i
heard
a
strange
daftlike
old
man
whom
they
called
sir
thomas
tode
tell
of
the
black
vault
of
dunure
and
how
lands
and
gear
were
gathered
by
the
tortures
there
his
tales
and
his
manners
were
so
strange
and
unseemly
that
i
vowed
before
long
to
take
an
opportunity
to
hear
him
more
fully
but
now
there
was
much
else
to
do
betimes
we
came
to
the
tower
of
kelwood
and
saw
only
the
black
mass
of
it
stand
up
against
the
sky
with
not
a
peep
of
light
anywhere
now
as
you
may
judge
we
went
cannily
and
as
far
as
might
be
we
kept
over
the
soft
ground
the
tutor
bade
us
cast
a
compass
about
the
house
so
that
we
might
make
ourselves
masters
of
the
fields
and
thus
be
sure
that
no
enemy
was
lying
there
in
wait
for
us
but
we
encompassed
the
place
and
found
nothing
alive
save
some
lean
swine
that
ran
snorting
forth
from
a
shelter
where
they
had
thought
to
pass
the
night
then
i
and
the
young
laird
of
gremmat
being
the
best
armed
and
most
active
there
were
sent
forward
to
spy
out
the
securest
way
of
taking
the
tower
i
liked
the
job
well
enough
for
i
never
was
greatly
feared
of
danger
all
my
days
and
at
any
rate
there
is
small
chance
of
distinction
sitting
one
s
horse
in
the
midst
of
twenty
others
in
an
open
field
so
gremmat
and
i
went
about
the
house
and
about
which
was
not
a
castle
with
towers
and
trenches
like
dunure
or
culzean
but
only
a
petty
blockhouse
and
i
laughed
within
myself
to
think
of
such
a
bees
byke
having
the
mighty
assurance
to
dream
of
keeping
a
treasure
against
my
lord
cassillis
as
well
as
against
the
tutor
of
that
ilk
and
me
his
squire
there
was
no
drawbridge
nor
yet
so
much
as
a
ditch
about
kelwood
tower
but
only
a
little
with
an
open
pend
or
passage
that
gave
against
the
main
wall
of
the
building
within
this
passage
could
we
gain
it
i
knew
that
we
should
be
well
protected
and
have
time
to
burst
in
the
wall
even
if
the
door
withstood
us
for
once
within
the
archway
i
could
not
see
how
it
was
possible
for
those
in
the
house
to
reach
us
in
any
way
to
do
us
harm
gremmat
and
i
therefore
went
back
to
our
company
with
the
news
but
the
best
of
part
concerning
the
kept
to
myself
for
the
laird
of
gremmat
though
a
tough
fighter
was
not
a
man
of
penetration
so
that
i
well
deserved
the
credit
of
telling
what
i
alone
had
seen
when
i
told
the
chiefs
of
my
discovery
my
lord
of
cassillis
said
nothing
but
turned
abruptly
to
the
tutor
thinking
nothing
of
my
tidings
or
of
the
danger
i
had
been
in
to
bring
them
nevertheless
sir
thomas
my
master
turned
first
to
me
as
was
his
kindly
custom
it
is
well
done
of
you
launcelot
the
sheep
herding
on
kirrieoch
has
given
you
an
eye
for
other
things
he
said
and
at
that
i
think
the
earl
gave
me
a
little
more
consideration
though
all
that
he
said
was
no
more
than
well
tutor
and
what
do
you
advise
i
think
said
the
tutor
that
you
and
the
younger
men
had
best
take
launcelot
s
advice
and
conceal
yourselves
in
the
pend
of
the
with
picks
and
perhaps
a
mickle
tree
for
a
while
i
and
a
trumpeter
lad
summon
kelwood
himself
to
surrender
in
that
clump
of
trees
over
there
we
shall
be
out
of
reach
of
their
so
the
earl
took
the
advice
and
in
a
little
we
were
in
the
black
trough
of
the
pend
with
an
door
in
front
and
the
rough
unhewn
stones
of
the
wall
on
either
side
of
us
then
the
tutor
s
trumpet
blew
one
rousing
blast
and
then
another
till
we
could
hear
the
stir
of
men
roused
out
of
their
sleep
in
the
tower
above
us
but
we
ourselves
held
our
breaths
and
keeped
very
quiet
once
more
the
trumpet
blew
from
the
clump
of
oak
trees
over
against
the
main
gate
who
may
ye
be
that
blaws
horns
in
the
kelwood
without
asking
leave
of
me
cried
a
voice
from
the
narrow
window
in
the
wall
above
us
and
my
master
sir
thomas
answered
him
from
the
coppice
it
is
i
kennedy
of
culzean
that
come
from
your
liege
lord
to
demand
the
treasure
that
is
his
stolen
from
his
house
by
his
false
servant
and
now
reset
by
you
laird
currie
of
the
laird
laughed
contumeliously
from
his
turret
window
an
the
earl
wants
his
treasure
let
him
come
and
fetch
it
said
he
at
which
answer
it
was
all
that
we
could
do
to
keep
the
earl
quiet
he
was
for
setting
the
squared
tree
to
the
door
at
once
kelwood
again
we
heard
the
voice
of
sir
thomas
i
ken
well
who
has
deceived
you
in
this
matter
listen
to
no
glosing
words
no
man
can
strive
with
the
kennedy
and
prosper
in
all
these
lands
twixt
clyde
and
which
kennedy
cried
kelwood
from
his
window
fleeringly
and
this
set
the
earl
more
bitterly
against
him
than
ever
for
it
was
as
much
as
to
say
that
the
bargany
kennedies
were
equal
in
power
and
place
to
his
own
house
of
cassillis
lift
the
trees
and
to
it
he
cried
and
with
that
being
a
strong
man
of
his
own
body
he
garred
a
great
dirl
against
the
iron
of
the
door
and
though
he
had
many
faults
this
forwardness
should
be
minded
to
him
for
good
then
there
was
a
noise
indeed
coulters
and
dinging
merrily
against
the
door
while
from
aloft
came
shouts
and
the
rolling
of
heavy
stones
down
about
us
but
by
my
strategy
there
was
not
one
came
near
to
hurting
us
the
defenders
might
have
been
so
many
sparrows
fyling
the
roof
for
all
the
harm
they
did
to
us
but
nevertheless
they
banged
away
their
powder
and
shouted
we
that
were
with
the
earl
shouted
none
but
kept
dourly
to
our
work
stark
and
strong
was
the
bolted
door
of
kelwood
and
all
the
might
of
our
men
could
do
it
no
injury
nor
so
much
as
shake
the
hinges
it
must
have
been
the
work
of
a
deacon
among
the
hammermen
but
i
felt
that
we
were
against
the
wall
of
the
kitchen
for
one
side
of
the
passage
was
warm
on
my
right
hand
and
the
other
clammy
and
cold
so
i
cried
on
them
to
leave
the
door
and
pull
down
the
stones
of
the
jamb
on
my
right
then
since
i
had
given
them
good
advice
before
and
they
knew
that
i
was
of
the
household
of
the
wise
man
of
culzean
they
were
the
more
ready
to
take
the
counsel
though
they
thanked
me
not
a
word
but
only
lifted
the
tree
and
drave
at
it
make
first
a
hole
with
the
crowbars
said
i
pull
down
the
stones
they
are
set
without
lime
under
the
so
they
did
it
and
we
found
the
first
part
of
the
wall
as
i
had
said
not
difficult
of
conquest
but
the
inner
being
cemented
with
shell
lime
was
like
adamant
therefore
with
a
shout
we
set
the
tree
to
it
swinging
it
in
our
hands
after
many
attempts
we
sent
the
butt
of
it
crushing
through
and
then
before
the
enemy
could
come
to
the
threatened
place
we
had
made
a
hole
large
enough
for
a
man
to
enter
on
his
hands
and
knees
i
was
leaping
forward
to
be
first
within
but
gremmat
got
in
front
of
me
and
crawled
through
whereat
the
laird
of
kelwood
himself
came
at
him
with
his
gun
and
shot
gremmat
in
the
kernel
of
the
thigh
so
that
he
dropped
in
a
heap
on
the
floor
and
was
ever
thereafter
unable
of
his
legs
but
i
that
came
second
and
right
glad
was
i
then
that
i
had
not
been
first
rose
and
set
my
point
at
kelwood
for
he
was
tangled
up
with
the
reeking
musket
i
had
him
pierced
before
ever
he
had
time
to
draw
and
was
set
in
defence
for
the
next
that
might
come
when
the
earl
and
the
other
gentlemen
came
rushing
past
us
both
and
completely
invaded
the
place
of
kelwood
so
that
all
within
it
immediately
surrendered
then
the
earl
was
like
a
man
gone
mad
to
find
the
chest
and
questioned
the
laird
who
as
was
somewhat
natural
could
do
nothing
but
groan
on
the
floor
with
my
through
his
shoulder
but
in
a
little
they
found
the
box
in
a
cunning
under
his
bed
where
it
could
not
be
reached
except
by
moving
the
whole
couch
from
its
place
and
sliding
a
panel
being
done
the
secret
cavity
was
made
plain
it
had
been
a
harder
task
to
transport
young
gremmat
back
with
us
than
it
was
to
take
the
was
in
a
small
enough
compass
though
heavy
beyond
belief
but
after
going
a
mile
or
two
we
left
the
young
wildcap
at
the
house
of
a
good
and
safe
man
who
made
himself
bound
to
the
earl
for
his
safe
keeping
till
he
should
be
whole
of
his
wound
throwing
of
the
bloody
indeed
it
had
been
no
likeable
job
to
deny
cassillis
that
night
for
with
the
fighting
the
treasure
and
the
reproaches
of
kelwood
whom
he
could
hardly
be
kept
from
finishing
with
his
own
hand
his
spirit
was
apt
for
wars
and
the
more
that
he
himself
had
as
yet
had
little
experience
of
blows
or
the
smart
of
wounds
kelwood
we
left
with
those
of
his
dependents
that
had
been
in
the
tower
with
him
his
wound
proved
not
so
serious
as
it
might
have
been
and
in
a
month
he
was
safe
with
the
laird
of
thing
occasioned
a
most
bitter
quarrel
between
cassillis
and
the
craufords
as
indeed
hereafter
ye
shall
hear
it
was
already
greying
for
the
dawn
when
we
reached
the
house
on
the
red
moss
black
peter
was
at
the
door
and
within
the
kitchen
a
large
fire
was
blazing
which
because
the
night
was
chill
and
the
sweat
of
fighting
hardly
yet
well
dried
on
us
we
were
right
glad
to
see
we
laid
down
the
chest
in
a
little
trance
at
the
back
of
the
kitchen
setting
it
upon
an
oatmeal
ark
which
stood
there
black
peter
went
out
to
hold
our
horses
while
we
talked
together
and
left
his
daughter
a
lass
of
about
my
own
years
or
thereby
to
wait
upon
us
so
meeting
the
lass
in
the
dusk
of
the
trance
on
pretext
of
seeing
that
the
treasure
was
safe
i
took
occasion
of
a
kiss
of
that
i
liked
it
over
much
or
that
her
favours
were
precious
but
because
such
like
is
held
a
soldier
s
privilege
at
an
inn
and
no
more
to
be
disregarded
than
the
somewhat
less
but
the
wench
dang
me
soundly
on
the
ear
for
it
so
that
my
head
echoed
again
yet
i
liked
her
better
for
that
because
it
made
the
adventure
something
worth
attempting
go
she
cried
grow
your
beard
before
ye
set
up
to
kiss
women
i
would
as
soon
kiss
the
back
of
my
hand
as
a
man
wanting
the
beard
to
his
thus
she
gave
me
also
the
woman
s
buffet
of
the
tongue
and
i
could
have
answered
her
and
well
too
but
that
i
saw
behind
me
my
lord
cassillis
himself
and
right
heartily
he
was
i
do
admit
disconcerted
me
no
little
and
brought
me
to
silence
ah
lad
he
said
have
ye
not
learned
from
your
experience
of
this
night
that
women
are
just
like
castles
ye
must
reconnoitre
them
circumspectly
before
ye
can
hope
to
take
them
by
direct
he
went
by
giving
me
a
clap
on
the
shoulder
as
one
that
had
sympathy
both
with
the
winning
of
castles
and
of
women
and
i
think
he
liked
me
none
the
worse
for
it
in
the
long
run
but
i
hoped
that
he
would
not
make
a
jest
of
it
nor
tell
the
tutor
of
the
matter
for
my
master
sir
thomas
of
culzean
being
a
grave
man
and
reverend
was
not
apt
to
look
upon
the
follies
of
youth
with
so
kindly
and
comprehending
an
eye
within
the
kitchen
of
the
inn
of
the
red
moss
there
was
routh
of
liquor
and
all
the
cassillis
faction
were
gathered
there
quaffing
and
pledging
one
another
they
were
flushed
with
their
success
and
several
were
even
keen
for
assaulting
some
of
the
bargany
strongholds
at
once
but
the
tutor
cautioned
them
mind
what
ye
do
young
bargany
is
as
a
lion
compared
to
that
braying
ass
we
left
groaning
behind
us
at
kelwood
and
john
muir
of
auchendrayne
has
at
once
the
wisest
head
and
the
evilest
heart
in
all
this
broad
scotland
be
patient
and
abide
we
have
gotten
the
treasure
let
us
be
content
and
ay
and
by
waiting
give
them
the
next
score
in
the
game
said
the
young
earl
he
too
was
hot
with
success
so
they
stood
about
the
kitchen
with
of
horn
in
their
hands
while
the
earl
unfolded
a
plan
of
the
great
house
of
bargany
and
began
to
explain
how
it
might
be
taken
but
he
said
we
must
wait
till
by
some
overt
and
considered
act
of
war
bargany
gives
me
the
chance
to
execute
justice
within
my
balliary
of
carrick
as
is
my
legal
right
then
swiftly
we
shall
strike
before
that
bargany
can
reach
us
with
the
sword
or
john
muir
of
auchendrayne
foil
us
by
getting
at
the
king
with
his
fox
s
hardly
were
the
words
out
of
his
mouth
when
a
silence
fell
upon
us
the
earl
ceased
speaking
and
inclined
his
head
as
though
like
the
rest
of
us
he
were
harkening
eagerly
for
the
repeating
of
a
sound
then
we
who
listened
with
him
heard
something
that
was
like
the
clattering
of
horses
feet
at
a
gallop
which
came
nearer
and
nearer
there
arose
a
cry
from
the
front
of
the
wild
shrill
scream
the
unmistakable
parting
cry
of
a
man
stricken
to
death
with
steel
then
broke
forth
about
the
inn
of
the
red
moss
the
rush
of
many
horses
snorting
with
fear
and
fleeing
every
way
the
while
we
that
were
in
the
house
stood
as
it
had
been
carved
in
stone
so
swift
and
unexpected
was
this
thing
the
earl
remained
by
the
table
in
the
centre
with
his
hand
yet
on
the
plan
of
the
house
of
his
enemy
sir
thomas
was
still
bending
down
to
look
when
all
suddenly
the
glass
of
the
window
crashed
and
a
missile
came
flashing
through
thrown
by
a
strong
man
s
hand
it
fell
with
a
ring
of
iron
across
the
paper
that
was
outspread
on
the
table
it
was
a
dagger
heavily
hiked
with
silver
but
what
thrilled
us
all
with
fear
was
that
the
blade
of
it
was
red
nearly
to
the
hilt
and
distilled
blood
upon
the
chart
then
was
heard
from
without
something
that
sounded
like
a
man
as
of
a
man
that
had
been
longtime
in
again
there
came
the
galloping
of
a
single
horse
s
feet
the
first
in
all
in
the
house
to
run
to
the
door
was
no
other
than
the
young
lass
i
had
tried
to
kiss
she
flung
the
door
open
and
ran
to
a
dark
huddled
thing
which
lay
across
the
paving
stones
of
the
little
causeway
in
front
of
the
inn
my
they
have
slain
my
father
she
cried
we
that
were
within
also
rushed
out
by
the
front
door
forgetting
all
else
and
filled
with
dread
of
what
we
might
see
the
dawn
was
coming
red
from
the
east
and
there
in
the
first
flush
of
it
lay
black
peter
plain
to
be
seen
a
dark
tide
sluggishly
welling
from
his
side
and
his
young
daughter
trying
pitifully
to
staunch
it
with
the
bit
laced
napkin
wherewith
she
had
bound
her
hair
to
make
her
pleasant
in
the
men
s
eyes
when
peter
of
the
red
moss
saw
the
earl
he
tried
to
raise
himself
upon
his
elbow
from
the
ground
one
feeble
hand
went
waveringly
to
his
head
as
if
to
remove
his
bonnet
in
the
presence
of
his
chief
cassillis
sank
on
his
knees
beside
him
and
took
the
hand
there
was
a
fragment
of
a
leather
rein
still
clasped
in
it
cut
across
with
a
clean
slicing
cut
peter
peter
poor
man
who
has
done
this
to
you
he
asked
the
man
that
was
about
to
die
turned
his
eyes
this
way
and
that
my
lord
my
lord
he
said
struggling
with
the
choking
blood
that
rose
in
his
throat
it
grey
and
the
earl
listened
for
more
with
his
ear
down
to
peter
s
mouth
but
the
spirit
of
the
man
who
had
died
for
his
master
ebbed
dumbly
away
without
another
word
so
there
was
nothing
left
for
us
to
do
but
to
carry
him
in
and
this
we
did
in
the
young
sunshine
of
a
pleasant
morning
and
the
maid
washed
and
streeked
him
moaning
and
crooning
over
him
piteously
as
a
dove
does
that
wanteth
company
i
went
as
it
happed
into
the
trance
to
fetch
her
a
basin
of
clear
water
the
top
of
the
stood
empty
my
chest
i
cried
and
all
save
the
maid
alone
rushed
in
the
treasure
of
kelwood
was
gone
without
the
door
on
the
trampled
clay
and
mud
there
were
the
steads
of
naked
feet
many
and
small
but
of
the
for
which
we
had
ventured
so
much
that
night
we
saw
neither
hilt
nor
hair
clasp
nor
band
only
in
the
kitchen
of
the
house
on
the
red
moss
there
was
a
dead
man
and
a
maid
mourning
over
him
on
the
table
a
dagger
red
to
the
guard
and
from
it
fell
slowly
the
drip
of
a
man
s
life
blood
blotting
out
with
a
bitter
scorn
the
plans
of
our
wisest
and
the
enmity
of
our
proudest
crown
of
the
i
rode
forth
from
edinburgh
town
with
infinite
glee
and
assurance
of
spirit
no
longer
could
i
be
slighted
as
a
boy
for
that
day
i
even
i
launcelot
kennedy
had
been
put
to
the
is
i
had
been
proclaimed
rebel
and
outlaw
at
the
cross
of
edinburgh
with
three
blasts
of
the
king
s
horn
against
john
earl
of
cassillis
sir
thomas
of
culzean
called
the
tutor
of
cassillis
and
launcelot
kennedy
his
esquire
so
had
run
the
proclamation
i
wondered
what
that
unkempt
lassie
nell
kennedy
would
say
to
this
but
the
honour
itself
even
she
could
not
gainsay
it
is
true
that
there
were
others
forfaulted
as
well
as
earl
himself
that
was
a
sitter
in
the
king
s
council
board
sir
thomas
my
master
and
indeed
all
that
had
any
hand
in
the
great
contest
in
the
high
street
of
edinburgh
how
close
had
every
leal
burgess
kept
within
doors
that
day
and
how
briskly
screamed
for
the
watch
how
the
town
guards
sequestered
themselves
safe
behind
bars
and
were
very
quiet
for
there
was
hardly
a
man
to
be
seen
from
the
castle
to
that
was
not
a
kennedy
and
trying
to
kill
some
other
indeed
is
ever
the
way
with
our
name
and
clan
we
of
cassillis
had
ridden
hot
foot
to
edinburgh
to
denounce
the
bargany
faction
to
the
king
in
the
matter
of
the
treasure
and
the
killing
of
black
peter
not
that
we
knew
for
certain
that
it
was
bargany
who
had
any
hand
in
the
murder
and
reiving
but
it
was
necessary
to
make
a
bold
face
for
it
and
at
all
events
we
knew
that
the
thing
had
been
done
in
bargany
s
interests
so
we
went
all
prepared
to
declare
that
the
active
criminal
was
bargany
s
brother
thomas
of
drummurchie
a
bold
and
desperate
villain
who
had
been
outlawed
for
years
for
many
a
crime
besides
murder
in
all
its
degrees
also
we
hoped
that
if
the
king
were
in
a
good
humour
towards
us
of
cassillis
who
were
always
the
men
of
loyalty
and
peace
he
might
even
attaint
bargany
himself
so
that
our
earl
being
the
bailzie
or
chief
ruler
of
carrick
under
the
king
might
get
his
will
of
his
house
foe
and
thus
put
an
end
to
the
quarrel
for
there
was
no
other
hope
of
peace
save
that
our
enemies
should
be
laid
waste
but
we
found
king
james
in
aught
but
a
yielding
mood
the
ministers
of
edinburgh
and
in
especial
one
mr
robert
bruce
a
man
of
very
great
note
and
once
a
prime
favourite
with
the
king
had
been
setting
themselves
against
his
will
so
at
first
we
got
little
satisfaction
and
it
did
not
help
matters
that
on
the
second
day
of
our
visit
the
bargany
kennedies
and
mures
rode
into
the
town
in
sturdy
men
from
the
landward
parts
of
carrick
while
we
were
mostly
slighter
and
limberer
lads
from
the
side
of
it
that
looks
towards
the
sea
the
next
day
as
i
went
down
the
canongate
with
the
gold
lilies
of
cassillis
on
my
cocked
bonnet
i
declare
that
nearly
every
third
man
i
met
was
a
bargany
lout
swaggering
with
his
silly
favour
of
red
and
white
in
his
cap
but
for
all
that
i
ruffled
it
right
bravely
in
despite
of
them
all
letting
no
man
cock
his
feather
at
me
for
i
had
a
way
which
i
found
exceedingly
irritating
to
them
of
turning
the
skirt
or
my
blue
french
cloak
over
my
shoulder
when
i
met
one
of
the
other
faction
as
if
i
feared
defilement
from
the
contact
of
their
very
garments
this
i
did
with
all
of
the
even
with
mure
of
cloncaird
indeed
i
had
already
had
my
long
sword
three
times
out
of
its
sheath
by
the
time
i
got
to
the
at
holyrood
it
was
just
there
that
i
met
young
bargany
himself
coming
direct
from
the
king
s
presence
but
i
practised
my
pleasantry
not
with
him
for
a
more
man
did
i
never
beyond
our
earl
shame
be
to
me
for
saying
such
a
thing
and
indeed
before
any
man
that
ever
i
saw
but
gilbert
kennedy
of
bargany
was
the
bravest
man
that
was
to
be
gotten
in
any
land
as
all
men
that
saw
him
in
his
flower
do
to
this
day
admit
and
hearts
were
like
water
before
him
he
was
of
his
stature
tall
and
with
a
complexion
black
but
comely
noble
on
horseback
and
a
master
both
of
arms
and
at
all
pastimes
and
when
i
beheld
him
it
came
upon
me
to
salute
though
i
had
small
intention
thereof
till
i
saw
him
i
did
it
was
with
some
surprise
perceiving
no
doubt
the
earl
s
colours
that
he
returned
my
greeting
and
that
very
graciously
the
moment
after
i
looked
about
me
and
right
glad
i
was
to
observe
that
none
of
our
folk
had
been
in
the
place
before
the
palace
to
observe
my
salutation
after
this
we
of
cassillis
went
in
parties
of
three
or
four
and
our
swords
were
in
our
hands
all
the
day
in
spite
of
the
in
spite
even
of
the
king
s
guard
which
his
majesty
had
sent
to
keep
the
peace
when
he
himself
had
gone
off
to
linlithgow
in
the
sulks
as
at
this
time
was
oft
his
silly
wont
for
me
i
went
chiefly
with
sir
thomas
my
master
as
was
my
duty
but
being
allowed
to
choose
my
companion
i
chose
muckle
hugh
from
kirriemore
which
marches
with
mine
own
home
of
kirrieoch
on
minnochside
hugh
was
the
strongest
man
in
all
carrick
and
had
joined
the
command
chiefly
for
the
love
of
he
had
once
herded
sheep
for
us
and
my
mother
had
been
kind
to
him
and
given
him
new
milk
instead
of
skim
for
his
porridge
and
i
warrant
you
when
the
two
of
us
took
the
crown
of
the
causeway
we
stepped
aside
for
no
man
not
even
for
bargany
and
his
brother
drummurchie
had
we
seen
them
which
by
good
luck
we
never
did
but
others
we
saw
in
plenty
it
was
bargany
thieves
cassillis
cairds
as
we
cried
one
to
the
other
across
the
street
and
the
next
moment
there
we
were
ruffling
and
strutting
like
gamecocks
in
the
midst
of
the
causeway
neither
willing
to
give
way
then
give
them
iron
would
be
the
cry
and
in
a
clapping
of
hands
there
would
be
as
pretty
a
fight
as
one
might
wish
to
behold
in
a
gliff
there
on
the
cobble
stones
was
a
man
stretched
and
all
workmanly
completed
from
beginning
to
end
while
the
clock
of
st
giles
was
jangling
the
hour
of
noon
for
the
matter
of
the
killing
of
black
peter
and
the
way
that
lassie
his
daughter
held
his
head
as
she
washed
him
abode
with
us
and
made
our
hearts
hot
against
the
barganies
that
is
the
hearts
of
the
younger
of
us
for
i
wot
well
that
the
elders
thought
more
of
the
lost
box
of
treasure
than
of
many
men
s
lives
far
more
famous
and
necessary
than
that
of
poor
black
peter
who
died
in
his
duty
at
the
house
door
of
the
red
that
is
not
at
all
an
ill
death
to
die
but
there
came
a
day
when
the
ill
blood
drew
to
a
head
it
was
bound
to
come
because
for
weeks
the
two
factions
of
us
kennedies
had
been
itching
to
fly
at
each
other
s
throats
the
barganies
mostly
lodged
together
in
the
lower
parts
of
the
town
beneath
the
nether
bow
in
order
to
keep
us
away
from
the
king
when
he
was
at
holyrood
house
and
also
to
be
near
the
haunts
of
those
loose
characters
of
the
baser
sort
with
whom
as
was
natural
they
chiefly
consorted
we
on
our
part
dwelled
in
the
upper
portion
of
the
town
in
the
lawnmarket
and
in
the
fashionable
closes
about
the
for
none
of
us
so
far
as
i
knew
desired
to
mix
or
to
mell
with
loose
an
it
might
be
the
earl
himself
that
being
the
custom
and
privilege
of
the
nobility
as
morton
said
to
his
leman
when
he
wished
to
change
her
for
another
now
we
had
among
us
of
our
company
one
patrick
wishart
an
indweller
in
irvine
and
a
good
fighter
he
was
an
edinburgh
man
born
and
knew
all
the
lane
and
street
every
bend
and
bow
every
close
and
pend
and
turning
in
it
he
also
knew
that
which
was
even
more
valuable
where
the
king
s
guard
were
and
how
to
shut
them
up
till
we
had
done
our
needs
upon
our
foes
he
was
well
advised
besides
where
each
of
the
leaders
among
the
barganies
dwelt
on
the
day
appointed
the
earl
gave
us
all
a
by
the
back
of
saint
giles
high
kirk
beneath
the
wall
of
the
tolbooth
and
there
we
mustered
at
ten
of
the
clock
one
gay
morning
it
was
a
windy
day
and
spite
of
the
sun
the
airs
blew
shrewdly
from
the
eastern
sea
as
is
their
use
and
wont
all
the
year
in
the
high
street
of
edinburgh
now
our
young
earl
had
ever
plenty
of
siller
though
afterward
he
parted
with
it
but
seldom
yet
for
the
furtherance
of
his
cause
he
had
spent
it
lavishly
during
these
days
in
edinburgh
so
that
all
the
common
orders
in
our
upper
part
of
the
town
held
him
to
be
the
greatest
man
and
the
best
that
ever
lived
and
as
for
the
vices
he
showed
they
were
easy
popular
ones
such
as
common
folk
readily
excuse
and
even
approve
in
the
women
wine
and
so
as
we
swung
down
the
street
all
the
windows
of
the
armourers
shops
in
the
booths
about
the
kirk
of
saint
giles
were
opened
and
as
many
as
desired
it
were
supplied
with
spears
and
pikes
and
highland
axes
each
with
a
grappling
hook
at
the
back
as
had
brought
many
a
good
knight
down
at
the
red
harlaw
and
these
were
afterwards
a
great
advantage
to
us
for
though
we
were
much
fewer
in
numbers
yet
we
had
longer
weapons
of
assault
and
also
the
upper
side
of
the
street
to
fight
from
then
we
sallied
forth
crying
a
kennedy
and
the
streets
were
lined
to
see
us
go
by
many
a
douce
burgher
s
wife
knowing
our
good
intentions
and
our
not
companying
with
the
riotous
troublers
of
the
town
but
rather
when
we
could
compass
it
with
honest
sonsy
women
giving
us
her
blessing
from
an
upper
window
patrick
wishart
advised
that
we
should
stop
up
all
the
alleys
and
closes
as
far
down
as
the
blackfriar
s
wynd
with
barracadoes
of
carts
barrels
and
puncheons
to
prevent
the
enemy
sallying
forth
upon
us
from
behind
it
was
a
good
thought
and
but
for
a
foe
without
whom
we
knew
not
how
to
reckon
with
it
had
been
completely
successful
down
by
the
nether
bow
where
the
street
narrows
was
the
place
where
we
first
saw
the
misleared
bargany
faction
drawn
across
the
street
to
resist
us
and
contemn
the
king
s
authority
when
we
observed
them
we
gave
a
mighty
shout
and
heaved
our
weapons
into
the
air
that
they
might
see
the
excellence
of
our
arming
they
sent
a
shout
back
again
and
i
saw
in
front
of
their
array
bargany
himself
with
a
casque
on
his
head
the
sun
glinting
the
while
on
a
steel
cuirass
which
covered
him
back
and
front
then
i
gave
the
word
to
blow
up
the
matches
for
by
this
time
i
was
well
kenned
for
a
good
soldier
and
proper
marksman
and
had
by
my
lord
himself
been
put
over
the
hackbuttmen
which
was
a
great
honour
for
one
so
young
thus
we
advanced
to
the
onset
but
first
my
lord
of
cassillis
going
to
the
front
cried
to
kennedy
of
bargany
to
know
why
he
withstood
him
in
the
highway
of
the
king
s
principal
town
because
ye
have
lied
concerning
me
to
the
king
because
ye
have
slain
my
men
hated
my
race
and
sought
to
bring
me
to
my
death
answered
back
young
bargany
in
a
clear
high
voice
ye
lie
man
have
at
you
with
the
sword
cried
our
earl
who
was
never
a
great
man
with
his
tongue
though
sometimes
masterful
enough
with
his
hands
so
with
that
i
gave
the
order
and
our
hackbuttmen
shot
off
their
pieces
so
that
more
than
one
of
the
wearers
of
the
red
and
white
fell
headlong
a
kennedy
a
kennedy
cried
the
earl
to
it
my
lads
and
in
a
moment
we
were
on
them
by
instinct
we
had
dropped
our
matchlocks
and
taken
to
the
steel
so
that
the
first
thing
that
i
knew
i
was
at
thomas
of
drummurchie
s
throat
with
my
borrowed
pike
he
roared
an
oath
and
leaping
to
the
side
he
struck
the
shaft
with
his
sword
which
shore
the
point
off
near
to
my
upper
grip
and
there
is
little
doubt
but
that
i
had
been
spent
ere
i
could
have
drawn
my
sword
had
not
muckle
hugh
of
kirriemore
brought
his
broadsword
down
upon
the
steel
cap
of
the
wolf
of
drummurchie
so
that
with
the
mighty
blow
he
was
beaten
to
the
ground
and
being
senseless
men
trampled
upon
him
as
the
battle
swayed
to
and
fro
yet
i
have
never
forgotten
that
but
for
hugh
i
was
that
day
almost
sped
which
should
have
been
a
lesson
to
me
not
to
trust
to
a
weapon
of
which
i
had
no
skill
even
though
it
might
be
an
ell
longer
in
the
haft
than
my
sword
also
i
was
thankful
to
god
a
kennedy
a
kennedy
cried
we
we
are
driving
them
they
give
back
for
we
felt
the
downward
push
upon
the
hillslope
and
that
gave
us
courage
and
the
crying
of
bargany
was
almost
silenced
for
now
the
wearers
of
the
butcher
s
colours
had
enough
to
do
to
keep
steeks
with
us
with
their
faces
braced
to
the
brae
and
so
needed
all
their
breath
by
this
time
i
had
my
arm
cleared
and
my
sword
out
and
certes
but
the
fray
was
brisk
now
when
it
is
hand
to
hand
i
fear
no
man
once
i
had
a
chance
of
paying
my
score
in
the
matter
of
drummurchie
for
as
i
passed
over
him
he
cut
upwards
at
me
with
a
knife
but
i
spared
only
long
enough
from
the
man
i
was
engaging
at
the
time
who
indeed
was
no
swordsman
or
i
dared
not
have
done
it
to
slash
the
wolf
across
the
wrist
which
i
am
given
to
believe
has
troubled
his
all
his
for
no
more
than
this
he
has
borne
me
a
grudge
unto
this
day
so
malicious
and
revengeful
are
some
men
thus
we
drove
the
bargany
faction
into
the
canongate
in
spite
of
the
swordsmanship
of
their
chief
who
fought
ever
in
the
forefront
it
was
indeed
all
over
with
them
when
suddenly
from
behind
us
there
came
rushing
a
rabblement
of
men
with
weapons
in
their
hands
all
crying
bargany
scoundrels
with
long
hair
and
pallid
faces
they
were
and
they
laid
about
them
with
desperate
vigour
now
it
is
no
wonder
that
this
was
a
terrible
surprise
to
us
and
hearing
their
cry
the
broken
bargany
folk
down
the
streets
and
closes
took
heart
of
grace
to
have
at
us
again
we
were
not
discouraged
but
part
of
us
faced
about
so
as
to
fight
with
our
backs
set
one
to
the
other
nevertheless
i
saw
at
once
that
unless
some
help
came
we
were
overpowered
into
the
lanes
i
cried
though
indeed
i
had
no
right
to
give
an
order
but
in
the
pinch
of
necessity
it
is
he
who
sees
that
should
lead
so
into
one
of
the
narrow
lanes
which
led
to
the
ford
and
down
by
the
across
the
nor
loch
we
ran
but
not
in
the
way
of
a
rout
rather
we
retreated
orderly
and
grieved
at
heart
to
think
that
we
had
to
leave
so
many
of
our
sick
and
wounded
behind
us
yet
because
of
the
love
they
bore
us
as
peaceable
men
we
knew
that
the
town
s
dames
would
succour
lest
we
should
be
bloodily
revenged
on
their
husbands
when
we
came
back
if
they
did
not
at
the
edge
of
the
nor
loch
six
or
seven
of
us
made
a
rally
and
having
wounded
and
captured
one
of
the
desperadoes
whose
assault
had
turned
the
tables
against
cassillis
we
brought
him
with
us
thinking
that
my
lord
might
wish
to
question
him
with
the
pilniewinks
now
not
many
of
the
bargany
faction
pursued
some
because
they
knew
not
whither
we
were
gone
some
because
both
their
chief
and
the
wolf
of
drummurchie
were
hurt
and
others
again
because
the
rabble
which
had
fallen
on
our
rear
not
knowing
one
party
from
another
had
turned
their
weapons
upon
their
friends
nevertheless
it
was
a
patent
fact
that
we
good
men
of
cassillis
had
been
baffled
and
put
to
shame
by
the
thieves
of
bargany
in
the
open
high
street
of
edinburgh
it
has
not
happened
to
many
to
be
victorious
and
pursuing
and
again
broken
and
defeated
all
within
the
space
of
when
we
were
safe
from
pursuit
on
the
other
side
of
the
nor
loch
we
questioned
the
varlet
whom
i
and
others
had
captured
as
to
what
was
his
quarrel
against
us
nothing
he
said
i
and
the
others
were
lying
in
the
tolbooth
when
suddenly
the
gates
were
opened
and
there
stood
one
at
the
door
clad
in
grey
who
gave
a
sword
or
a
pike
to
each
man
as
well
as
a
piece
of
gold
telling
us
that
there
were
other
ten
of
the
same
awaiting
each
good
striker
who
should
fall
on
and
fight
those
whom
he
would
show
what
like
was
this
man
said
sir
thomas
my
master
an
ordinary
man
enough
said
the
fellow
grey
of
head
and
also
clad
in
grey
but
with
armour
that
rattled
beneath
his
clothes
then
we
looked
at
one
another
and
remembered
the
dying
words
of
black
it
grey
once
more
such
a
man
had
crossed
the
luck
of
cassillis
by
what
golden
key
he
had
bribed
the
warders
and
opened
his
majesty
s
tolbooth
we
knew
not
but
assuredly
he
had
clean
beaten
us
from
the
field
nevertheless
i
was
much
cheered
to
hear
on
the
next
day
that
the
name
of
launcelot
kennedy
called
of
kirrieoch
or
launcelot
of
the
spurs
was
among
those
that
were
put
to
the
horn
or
in
plain
words
declared
rebel
and
outlaw
at
the
cross
of
edinburgh
for
i
knew
that
nell
kennedy
would
never
flout
me
more
even
fair
marjorie
would
perhaps
not
disdain
speech
with
me
now
and
might
perchance
let
me
walk
by
her
side
in
the
garden
some
summer
evening
lady
s
it
was
as
i
had
foretold
those
that
had
flouted
me
for
a
beardless
boy
now
scorned
me
no
more
i
mean
chiefly
nell
kennedy
indeed
for
some
days
it
was
as
much
as
i
would
do
even
to
speak
to
her
she
would
make
shift
oftentimes
to
pass
me
in
the
pleasaunces
of
the
house
of
culzean
when
i
walked
abroad
in
the
sunshine
with
my
hand
on
my
was
my
receive
her
father
s
guests
for
there
was
a
great
repair
of
people
to
our
castle
ever
since
the
outlawing
the
cause
of
which
was
considered
most
fortunate
and
honourable
to
all
concerned
nell
kennedy
as
i
say
would
often
pass
me
in
the
orchard
or
in
the
italian
garden
which
her
father
had
made
with
great
expense
and
as
she
went
by
she
would
kick
with
her
foot
a
stone
in
front
of
me
but
of
this
i
took
no
heed
whatever
no
more
than
if
i
had
not
seen
it
because
for
my
own
part
i
was
resolved
never
to
think
of
maids
and
such
light
matters
again
but
rather
to
concern
myself
solely
with
glory
as
became
one
who
at
eighteen
had
been
outlawed
for
rebellion
and
other
deeds
of
military
prowess
once
it
happened
that
we
were
all
in
the
the
loons
james
and
alexander
kennedy
and
little
david
sir
thomas
s
youngest
son
also
nell
kennedy
was
there
sir
thomas
himself
was
walking
to
and
fro
at
the
garden
s
end
all
by
his
lone
with
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
back
as
was
his
custom
then
nell
who
being
angry
desired
above
all
else
to
put
a
slight
upon
me
called
me
to
come
to
her
speaking
roughly
as
though
i
had
been
a
servitor
and
bade
me
take
a
misbehaving
puppy
dog
of
hers
within
doors
but
i
was
equal
with
her
and
beckoned
to
me
sandy
her
brother
who
played
about
on
the
grass
plots
who
may
this
little
girl
be
that
hath
the
messan
dog
with
her
i
asked
of
him
thou
art
a
great
blind
not
to
know
my
sister
nell
he
answered
and
ran
again
to
his
play
with
his
brothers
ah
said
i
looking
over
the
heads
of
those
that
stood
near
by
now
i
do
remember
to
have
seen
the
little
maid
playing
with
her
dolls
before
i
went
to
the
wars
and
with
that
i
marched
off
and
walked
to
and
fro
on
the
terrace
near
to
my
master
presently
he
came
and
walked
with
me
as
i
had
hoped
he
would
in
sight
of
nell
and
of
them
all
speaking
low
and
kindly
the
while
and
i
listened
as
though
it
were
an
affair
of
state
and
policy
he
had
been
confiding
to
my
private
ear
though
indeed
it
was
only
concerning
our
greatly
increased
expenses
with
the
vast
number
of
guests
who
came
to
see
him
and
his
fear
that
the
buttery
might
be
running
low
when
nell
kennedy
had
betaken
herself
away
in
an
access
of
anger
and
despite
i
made
my
bow
to
sir
thomas
her
father
and
went
to
the
italian
pleasaunce
once
again
presently
the
young
lady
marjorie
came
walking
by
fairer
of
face
than
the
flower
of
the
hawthorn
hedge
on
a
moonlight
night
but
with
hair
tossed
about
her
temples
blacker
than
the
sky
on
a
night
of
stars
her
eyes
were
bright
and
large
when
she
turned
them
on
me
launcelot
come
and
walk
with
me
awhile
she
said
kindly
unless
you
have
something
better
to
your
arms
and
war
gear
as
it
may
be
she
added
and
her
way
of
speaking
thus
of
my
calling
as
a
soldier
pleased
me
also
in
spite
of
my
renunciation
of
all
pleasure
in
women
s
society
my
heart
gave
a
great
stound
at
her
marked
favour
perhaps
also
at
the
way
she
had
in
walking
which
was
with
her
head
high
and
her
bosom
set
well
forward
in
its
openwork
bodice
of
fair
linen
and
all
her
sweet
body
swaying
lightly
to
the
side
as
a
willow
wand
that
bends
in
the
wind
her
voice
the
voice
of
marjorie
kennedy
sounded
like
the
running
of
deep
water
in
a
linn
under
the
dusk
of
trees
with
undercurrents
of
sobs
and
pitifulness
in
it
for
all
that
it
was
so
proud
for
even
thus
in
her
youth
walking
as
the
fairest
maid
the
sun
shone
on
marjorie
seemed
ever
to
be
fey
trysted
to
some
lot
beyond
that
of
maids
who
are
to
be
good
men
s
wives
and
mothers
but
enough
of
speaking
about
her
and
about
better
that
i
should
tell
what
she
said
to
me
as
we
walked
up
and
down
while
the
young
buds
were
cracking
open
that
gracious
may
gloaming
it
was
a
good
fight
i
hear
and
well
fought
she
said
which
fight
may
it
please
you
to
speak
of
my
lady
marjorie
said
i
making
as
though
i
had
been
in
many
the
battle
in
the
high
street
of
edinburgh
she
made
answer
and
methought
smiled
as
she
said
it
but
there
was
no
bairnly
scorn
or
raw
coltish
ignorance
in
marjorie
s
smile
as
there
mostly
was
in
the
face
of
her
was
nothing
but
a
child
at
any
rate
and
still
wore
her
hair
without
a
snood
flying
about
her
shoulders
then
i
told
marjorie
kennedy
of
all
the
fight
and
she
listened
with
face
turned
away
from
me
to
the
sea
looking
to
the
hills
of
arran
that
were
so
blue
in
the
distance
so
that
for
a
space
i
thought
she
hearkened
not
to
what
i
said
but
in
a
little
she
interrupted
me
and
you
speak
thus
with
admiration
of
gilbert
kennedy
of
bargany
he
that
is
an
enemy
to
our
house
and
name
how
say
ye
then
that
such
an
one
is
noble
and
worthy
for
i
had
been
telling
her
of
meeting
him
coming
from
the
king
s
palace
ay
noble
and
generous
is
gilbert
kennedy
of
bargany
as
well
as
the
handsomest
man
that
walks
with
a
spring
to
his
feet
as
one
that
goes
upon
the
deep
twigs
of
the
pine
trees
in
the
woods
he
can
twirl
a
lance
in
one
hand
on
i
myself
have
seen
was
there
such
a
man
for
i
had
given
him
all
my
heart
and
admiration
being
then
at
least
not
very
old
in
i
wished
with
all
my
strength
that
such
an
one
had
been
chief
of
our
side
and
earl
of
cassillis
instead
of
he
that
was
though
my
lord
is
a
good
man
also
and
i
deny
it
not
then
it
was
that
my
lady
marjorie
showed
me
the
greatest
favour
that
ever
she
showed
to
any
man
and
caused
my
heart
to
beat
high
with
love
and
hope
for
she
took
my
hand
in
hers
holding
it
to
her
side
as
she
and
stroked
and
touched
it
gently
with
her
other
hand
as
we
went
along
being
hidden
by
the
screen
of
the
leaves
in
the
pleasaunce
hedges
now
this
was
so
sweet
to
me
and
precious
that
i
slept
with
my
right
hand
in
a
glove
of
silk
for
many
and
even
forbore
to
wash
it
for
i
bethought
me
that
though
as
a
man
of
war
i
had
forsworn
the
society
of
silly
girls
yet
every
true
knight
had
a
lady
for
his
heart
s
mistress
whose
colours
he
might
wear
in
his
helmet
and
whose
lightest
word
he
might
treasure
in
his
heart
thus
we
two
walked
and
talked
while
the
sun
was
going
down
and
the
colours
of
a
dove
s
breast
crept
over
the
water
from
the
west
and
this
gilbert
of
me
of
being
the
great
enemy
of
our
house
i
desire
to
hear
more
of
him
she
said
so
i
told
her
being
nothing
loth
to
speak
of
so
brave
an
enemy
was
he
at
all
hurt
in
the
combat
think
you
she
asked
again
carelessly
as
one
that
thinks
of
other
things
wounded
no
i
replied
with
a
laugh
on
the
contrary
he
pursued
us
down
to
the
ford
of
the
nor
loch
and
defied
us
all
to
come
back
and
have
it
out
but
i
think
that
not
he
but
another
had
a
hand
in
the
craven
s
trick
of
letting
loose
on
us
the
offscourings
of
the
catherans
and
border
and
who
might
that
other
be
she
asked
that
i
replied
with
dignity
i
am
not
at
liberty
to
tell
it
is
yet
a
secret
under
tell
it
me
she
said
bending
her
eyes
on
me
that
were
beautiful
as
i
know
not
what
and
this
indeed
i
should
very
gladly
have
done
at
that
moment
but
truly
i
knew
nothing
of
the
matter
so
i
made
haste
to
answer
that
i
would
readily
die
for
her
but
that
it
was
a
soldier
s
duty
that
he
should
keep
the
secrets
with
which
his
honour
had
been
entrusted
then
tell
me
what
you
can
she
said
so
quietly
that
i
was
ashamed
of
my
subterfuge
though
that
is
the
way
that
all
wise
men
must
talk
to
women
so
as
to
keep
the
peace
telling
them
mostly
the
truth
but
seldom
the
whole
truth
it
was
said
i
the
grey
man
ah
she
replied
quickly
drawing
away
her
hand
and
laying
it
upon
her
heart
the
grey
man
what
ken
ye
of
the
grey
man
i
asked
her
in
surprise
nothing
she
said
giving
me
back
her
hand
i
know
not
why
but
for
the
moment
something
came
upon
me
and
i
felt
as
it
had
been
a
little
faint
it
is
nothing
it
has
already
then
i
wished
to
bring
her
a
cup
of
wine
from
the
house
but
she
laughed
more
merrily
than
ever
i
had
heard
her
and
tossed
back
the
lace
kerchief
which
confined
her
hair
so
that
it
lay
about
her
white
neck
with
the
ends
dropping
over
her
bosom
let
us
two
walk
here
yet
a
space
launcelot
she
said
for
it
is
lonely
within
the
great
a
saying
which
made
my
heart
swell
with
gladness
and
pride
for
she
had
never
thus
distinguished
any
man
before
so
that
i
forgot
all
about
my
vows
and
about
forswearing
to
company
with
women
but
this
was
indeed
very
different
my
lady
marjorie
i
said
i
much
desired
to
say
my
sweet
lady
as
they
do
in
the
stage
plays
but
dared
not
my
lady
marjorie
i
said
i
even
i
will
be
your
true
knight
and
fight
for
you
against
all
if
so
be
that
coming
home
i
may
see
the
pleasure
in
your
ah
will
you
truly
she
asked
and
sighed
then
she
was
silent
for
a
moment
but
drew
not
away
her
hand
which
i
took
of
be
a
good
omen
no
you
must
must
not
it
would
not
be
fair
she
said
i
love
you
with
all
my
heart
i
whispered
trying
to
reach
her
hand
but
somehow
though
it
was
very
near
i
could
not
again
take
it
in
mine
she
seemed
not
to
hear
me
speak
well
she
said
at
last
as
if
to
herself
perhaps
it
will
be
good
for
the
i
could
not
conceive
what
she
meant
launcelot
she
continued
and
her
voice
had
music
in
it
such
as
i
never
heard
in
any
kirk
or
quire
at
matins
or
at
laud
launcelot
do
not
think
of
me
i
pray
least
not
if
you
can
help
help
it
i
can
not
answered
i
it
is
far
beyond
that
and
so
i
thought
at
the
time
but
launcelot
my
sweet
squire
she
said
again
hast
thou
already
forgotten
thy
vow
it
is
better
for
thee
to
be
a
squire
of
arms
than
a
squire
of
dames
at
least
she
added
smiling
till
you
win
your
i
will
win
them
for
your
sake
an
you
will
let
me
marjorie
i
cried
win
them
then
launcelot
she
made
me
answer
suddenly
breaking
from
her
reserve
win
them
for
my
see
meantime
you
shall
wear
my
and
she
undid
a
brooch
of
gold
whereon
were
the
lilies
of
france
that
were
the
badge
of
her
house
and
setting
it
on
the
velvet
collar
of
my
coat
she
gave
a
little
dainty
pat
to
the
place
where
she
put
it
it
sets
you
well
she
said
pushing
my
hair
to
one
side
to
look
at
me
two
such
i
have
wear
you
one
and
i
shall
wear
the
marjorie
kennedy
and
the
honour
of
it
sounded
like
a
sacred
oath
rather
than
the
posy
of
a
marjorie
kennedy
and
the
honour
of
then
most
humbly
would
i
have
lifted
her
fingers
to
my
lips
and
kissed
them
not
daring
more
but
she
put
her
hand
on
my
head
for
she
was
tall
though
not
as
tall
as
i
and
bent
sweetly
to
me
the
blood
of
all
my
heart
fled
insurgent
to
my
ears
deafening
me
as
i
also
stooped
toward
her
no
not
there
she
whispered
and
kissed
me
gently
on
the
brow
my
laddie
she
said
be
brave
true
noble
and
one
day
you
shall
know
root
and
branch
what
the
love
of
woman
and
waving
me
not
to
follow
her
she
went
in
with
her
head
turned
away
from
my
sight
so
there
for
a
great
space
i
stood
in
the
dusk
of
the
arbour
mazed
and
bewildered
by
the
strange
by
the
touch
of
her
lips
ay
more
than
if
the
king
himself
had
laid
his
sword
on
my
shoulder
in
the
way
of
accolade
then
at
last
i
moved
and
went
in
also
dragging
away
from
the
sweet
and
memorable
place
at
the
garden
gate
i
met
nell
kennedy
and
made
to
pass
without
seeing
her
but
she
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
way
i
know
she
said
pointing
scornfully
with
her
finger
maidie
has
been
talking
to
you
behind
the
hedge
she
has
given
you
the
french
brooch
she
would
not
give
me
yesterday
though
she
has
then
i
walked
silently
past
her
with
as
great
dignity
as
i
could
command
for
that
is
ever
the
best
way
with
forward
children
but
she
turned
and
cried
after
me
i
know
who
will
get
that
a
saying
which
did
not
trouble
me
though
i
could
not
quite
forget
it
for
i
knew
well
enough
that
it
was
only
nell
s
spite
because
her
sister
had
not
given
her
the
golden
badge
which
she
coveted
high
in
my
room
in
the
white
tower
i
sat
and
looked
out
to
the
sea
there
i
sat
all
night
sleepless
till
the
sun
rose
over
the
woods
and
the
chilly
tops
of
the
waves
glittered
i
bethought
me
on
all
that
had
happened
and
i
remembered
with
shame
many
things
in
which
i
had
done
not
wisely
especially
in
the
matter
of
the
grieve
s
lass
and
my
convoying
of
her
home
through
the
wood
for
now
with
marjorie
kennedy
s
badge
against
my
lips
all
things
had
become
new
bitterly
was
i
ashamed
of
my
folly
and
right
briskly
did
i
repent
of
it
laird
of
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
the
taking
of
the
treasure
of
kelwood
was
permitted
to
pass
without
the
earl
a
man
keener
for
red
siller
than
any
other
man
in
scotland
casting
about
him
for
the
reivers
of
the
gear
he
had
so
confidently
counted
his
own
his
old
grandmother
of
a
countess
whom
though
a
young
man
he
had
shamefully
married
for
her
tocher
and
plenishing
flustered
about
the
house
of
cassillis
like
a
hen
dancing
on
a
hot
girdle
when
she
heard
of
the
loss
it
was
but
the
other
day
that
she
had
had
to
draw
her
and
pay
down
eight
thousand
merks
that
her
man
might
be
permitted
to
resign
the
office
of
high
treasurer
lest
all
her
gear
would
be
wasted
in
making
loans
to
the
king
who
had
great
need
of
such
and
so
the
further
loss
of
this
treasure
sat
wondrously
heavy
on
my
lady
cassillis
as
indeed
it
did
on
her
husband
the
earl
himself
rode
over
to
culzean
to
hold
council
concerning
it
with
his
uncle
the
tutor
he
cherished
a
wonderful
affection
for
sir
thomas
considering
that
is
what
a
selfish
man
he
was
and
how
bound
up
in
his
own
interests
so
after
they
had
talked
together
a
while
pacing
up
and
down
in
the
garden
while
i
walked
apart
and
pressed
the
hard
of
marjorie
kennedy
s
trysting
favour
to
my
breast
for
comfort
they
called
me
to
them
so
with
all
respect
and
speed
i
went
and
stood
with
my
bonnet
off
to
hear
their
commands
i
thought
that
it
was
some
light
matter
of
having
the
horses
brought
but
when
i
came
the
earl
was
looking
keenly
at
me
and
even
sir
thomas
paused
a
little
while
before
he
spoke
launcelot
you
are
a
brave
lad
he
said
and
i
know
that
you
desire
to
distinguish
yourself
even
more
than
you
have
done
though
you
have
shown
your
mettle
already
now
my
lord
and
i
have
a
matter
which
it
needs
a
man
to
of
address
and
daring
i
hear
from
all
about
me
that
you
are
a
ready
man
with
your
wits
and
your
tongue
will
you
bear
my
lord
s
cartel
of
defiance
to
his
enemy
david
crauford
of
kerse
ay
my
lords
that
will
i
and
readily
i
replied
knowing
that
my
good
fortune
stood
on
tiptoe
i
am
not
eager
the
earl
said
breaking
in
upon
my
reply
for
reasons
which
i
have
given
to
the
tutor
to
send
one
of
my
own
folk
i
would
rather
accredit
one
more
kin
to
culzean
here
one
who
is
a
gentleman
of
good
blood
and
a
brave
kennedy
such
as
i
observed
you
to
be
on
the
day
of
the
tulzie
in
i
will
serve
cassillis
till
i
die
i
replied
making
him
a
little
i
wished
him
to
see
that
though
i
was
of
the
moorland
house
i
had
yet
manners
as
good
as
he
had
brought
back
with
him
from
france
besides
i
saw
marjorie
looking
down
upon
us
from
the
terrace
which
made
me
glance
at
my
shadow
as
it
lay
clearly
outlined
upon
the
gravel
and
i
was
glad
to
observe
that
the
point
of
my
cloak
fell
with
some
grace
over
the
scabbard
of
my
sword
now
this
was
not
vanity
god
knows
but
only
a
just
desire
to
appear
point
device
in
the
presence
of
the
heads
of
my
clan
and
of
the
lady
of
my
is
a
thing
very
different
for
of
all
things
i
am
not
vain
nor
given
after
the
manner
of
some
to
talking
greatly
about
my
own
exploits
so
said
the
earl
you
will
go
to
david
crauford
of
kerse
at
his
own
house
as
my
messenger
you
will
not
give
him
a
written
but
a
spoken
message
and
in
token
that
you
come
from
us
who
have
power
to
speak
you
must
exhibit
to
him
our
signet
rings
which
we
now
entrust
to
you
to
guard
with
your
so
giving
me
the
rings
which
i
put
under
my
glove
upon
the
first
finger
of
the
left
hand
he
communicated
to
me
the
cartel
for
the
laird
of
kerse
which
he
made
me
repeat
carefully
thrice
over
in
their
hearing
then
he
dismissed
me
to
go
my
way
and
as
i
went
i
saw
the
lads
roistering
in
the
garden
with
the
young
sheriff
of
wigton
who
had
married
their
eldest
sister
when
she
was
but
a
lassie
and
i
smiled
as
i
thought
within
me
had
i
been
so
born
to
lofty
estate
i
might
even
have
been
playing
at
golf
and
instead
of
riding
on
the
errands
of
cassillis
and
culzean
with
an
earl
s
message
in
my
mouth
and
an
earl
s
signet
on
my
and
i
do
not
think
that
the
pride
was
an
unworthy
one
for
since
i
had
none
to
push
my
fortune
for
me
it
was
the
more
necessary
that
i
should
be
able
to
do
it
for
myself
i
went
to
get
my
for
after
the
affair
of
edinburgh
sir
thomas
had
given
me
dom
nicholas
a
black
of
mettle
and
power
well
able
to
carry
me
even
had
i
been
clad
in
full
armour
instead
of
merely
riding
light
as
i
now
meant
to
go
with
only
my
sword
and
pistolets
at
the
seaward
corner
of
the
white
tower
going
by
the
way
of
the
stables
i
met
my
lady
marjorie
and
my
heart
gave
a
bound
at
the
seeing
of
her
she
came
gravely
forward
to
give
me
her
hand
yet
not
to
kiss
as
i
knew
by
the
downward
weighting
of
it
and
by
her
taking
it
quickly
again
to
herself
whither
go
you
grave
man
of
affairs
she
said
smiling
with
pleasantry
i
go
with
an
earl
s
cartel
and
defiance
i
replied
telling
her
perhaps
more
than
i
ought
but
then
she
was
my
lady
marjorie
became
very
pale
and
set
her
hand
on
the
stone
parapet
of
the
sea
wall
where
she
stood
to
bargany
she
asked
breathlessly
for
it
was
natural
she
should
think
that
the
quarrel
with
the
family
had
broken
out
again
not
to
bargany
i
said
smiling
to
reassure
her
i
can
not
now
tell
you
where
but
it
is
out
of
carrick
that
i
for
a
for
a
cow
i
ride
to
the
land
of
sweet
milk
cheese
god
speed
you
then
she
said
take
care
of
of
the
dairymaids
i
have
heard
they
are
for
your
sweet
sake
cried
i
waving
my
bonnet
to
her
as
i
ran
down
the
path
but
before
i
went
fairly
out
of
sight
i
turned
and
looked
back
for
indeed
i
could
not
help
it
and
marjorie
was
still
standing
under
the
archway
where
i
had
left
her
but
with
so
sad
and
lost
a
countenance
that
i
had
run
back
to
ask
her
what
was
her
grief
then
she
seemed
to
awake
kissed
the
tips
of
her
fingers
to
me
and
turning
her
about
walked
slowly
within
when
i
was
fully
arrayed
i
rode
past
the
front
of
the
house
on
pretext
of
knowing
if
my
lords
had
any
further
commands
for
me
but
really
that
the
maids
might
see
me
upon
dom
nicholas
in
his
fair
caparison
of
beaten
silver
she
whom
i
wished
most
to
see
i
saw
not
indeed
but
there
at
the
great
gate
with
a
foolish
spraying
branch
of
hawthorn
in
her
hair
was
nell
kennedy
of
whom
during
these
last
days
i
had
scarcely
so
much
as
thought
and
with
her
to
my
burning
shame
and
amaze
was
kate
allison
the
grieve
s
daughter
the
two
girls
stood
with
their
arms
about
one
another
s
waists
as
maids
that
are
yet
half
bairns
are
wont
to
do
but
neither
of
them
looked
at
me
only
when
i
made
dom
nicholas
caracole
by
they
turned
disdainfully
aside
as
though
they
were
avoiding
the
path
of
some
poisonous
toad
or
asp
and
so
wholly
without
word
they
passed
down
one
of
the
leafy
avenues
that
beset
the
place
of
culzean
which
thing
in
a
moment
rendered
all
my
full
sweet
cup
empty
and
bitter
at
this
i
was
much
dashed
and
crestfallen
so
that
i
had
no
spirit
in
me
for
i
was
sure
by
the
attitude
of
the
maids
and
their
demeanour
to
me
that
they
had
gotten
to
the
stage
of
the
confiding
of
secrets
and
if
that
were
so
i
had
a
good
guess
that
it
would
be
as
well
for
me
to
avoid
the
grieve
s
house
by
the
shore
for
some
time
to
come
which
thing
indeed
last
evening
s
tryst
with
marjorie
had
made
me
resolve
on
before
but
it
was
not
the
matter
of
kate
allison
s
anger
that
troubled
me
it
was
rather
that
the
clattering
minx
nell
kennedy
would
certainly
tell
her
sister
of
my
past
boyish
affairs
with
the
pretty
young
lass
and
specially
of
our
from
the
march
fair
so
late
at
night
but
the
stir
of
going
through
the
town
of
lasses
running
to
the
doors
to
admire
the
prentice
lads
envying
and
hating
me
so
worked
on
me
that
for
a
space
i
forgot
the
memory
of
the
two
maids
linking
down
though
the
greenwood
together
yet
the
thing
came
again
into
my
mind
and
stuck
there
before
i
had
o
ertaken
half
the
way
to
dalrymple
by
which
i
was
behoved
to
go
as
i
rode
along
i
practised
pulling
at
the
wicks
of
my
upper
lip
where
i
was
persuaded
that
my
moustache
was
certainly
beginning
to
grow
apace
for
so
i
had
seen
the
soldiers
of
the
king
s
guard
do
in
edinburgh
and
mightily
admired
them
at
it
the
way
went
pleasantly
by
there
being
many
folk
of
all
degrees
and
qualities
on
the
road
and
as
many
as
saw
me
come
stepped
aside
and
stood
respectfully
at
gaze
if
they
were
on
foot
or
courteously
saluted
me
as
an
equal
if
they
were
on
horseback
both
which
things
pleased
me
well
so
i
went
on
smiling
to
myself
for
the
pleasantness
of
my
thoughts
in
spite
of
the
incident
of
the
lasses
suddenly
however
i
came
upon
a
horseman
like
myself
that
rode
down
a
loaning
from
the
muirside
i
saw
no
weapon
that
he
had
about
him
yet
he
was
no
mere
landward
minister
or
merchant
by
the
sober
richness
of
his
habit
he
was
dressed
in
fine
cloth
of
flemish
blue
with
a
plain
edging
of
silk
but
without
lace
or
any
broidery
his
face
when
i
saw
it
was
pleasant
and
there
was
on
it
a
smile
that
spoke
of
good
cheer
he
seemed
to
be
tall
of
his
person
and
from
the
manner
in
which
he
reined
his
horse
easily
with
his
left
hand
i
knew
him
to
be
strong
a
sober
conditionable
man
of
fifty
i
should
have
taken
him
to
be
fit
to
be
head
of
a
house
or
to
sit
at
a
king
s
council
table
but
his
occupation
was
the
strange
part
of
his
sudden
appearing
he
was
employed
in
reading
a
little
book
which
he
held
in
his
right
hand
riding
easily
all
the
while
with
his
horse
at
a
brisk
thing
which
i
never
saw
anyone
do
before
then
was
i
sure
that
he
was
a
man
of
religion
by
his
busying
himself
thus
with
his
devotions
at
which
i
was
the
better
pleased
since
religion
is
a
thing
i
was
ever
taught
to
reverence
above
all
else
for
that
is
the
habit
of
the
moorland
folk
who
get
but
little
of
it
on
the
other
hand
they
tell
me
that
in
edinburgh
where
there
are
as
many
as
seven
ministers
the
folk
pay
little
heed
to
their
privileges
and
are
as
indeed
i
have
seen
given
over
to
following
all
manner
of
wickedness
and
that
with
greediness
as
my
came
down
the
loaning
he
looked
up
and
seeing
me
he
wheeled
his
horse
alongside
of
mine
and
very
courteously
gave
me
then
as
well
he
might
he
admired
dom
nicholas
letting
his
eyes
stray
smilingly
over
my
equipage
yet
even
at
that
moment
i
marked
that
it
was
a
set
smile
and
methought
that
there
was
a
busy
brain
behind
it
you
ride
like
a
soldier
that
hath
seen
the
wars
young
sir
he
said
ah
i
replied
lifting
my
bonnet
of
steel
as
to
an
elder
but
little
enough
of
these
my
lord
for
i
am
but
a
you
will
mend
of
that
last
i
warrant
said
my
companion
and
in
the
end
more
swiftly
than
you
will
care
you
were
busy
with
your
book
of
devotion
said
i
with
respect
for
i
care
not
to
force
my
conversation
on
any
man
let
me
not
nay
he
said
i
fear
i
am
no
great
churchman
though
for
my
servants
sake
i
have
reading
and
worship
daily
in
my
own
house
and
generally
i
may
claim
to
be
very
well
affected
toward
the
are
there
no
churches
in
your
part
of
the
country
i
asked
him
for
i
perceive
by
your
habit
you
are
not
a
hereaway
man
there
are
indeed
kirks
there
but
i
can
not
bide
to
be
hampered
and
taken
in
a
snare
within
walls
in
the
present
unsettled
state
of
the
country
a
peaceable
man
does
well
to
worship
in
the
open
what
sense
is
there
in
being
shut
weaponless
in
a
kirk
and
shot
at
through
the
windows
as
happened
not
long
ago
i
asked
how
that
could
be
have
you
not
heard
how
in
the
north
country
the
craufords
beset
the
kennedies
in
dalrymple
kirk
taking
them
at
an
advantage
without
their
weapons
of
that
a
kennedy
now
goes
no
oftener
to
kirk
than
the
of
february
comes
into
the
how
strange
it
befalls
in
a
small
world
said
i
laughing
for
i
am
a
kennedy
and
i
ride
to
visit
the
craufords
of
then
he
looked
at
me
more
closely
than
ever
my
name
he
said
courteously
is
john
mure
of
so
i
told
him
my
name
and
style
and
also
the
knight
s
name
to
whom
i
was
squire
for
after
his
giving
me
his
own
i
could
not
do
less
you
have
been
in
edinburgh
lately
he
said
and
i
doubt
not
by
your
looks
bore
yourself
well
in
the
sad
broil
in
the
high
street
indeed
i
think
that
i
heard
as
much
though
being
a
man
of
good
age
and
one
that
is
of
quiet
ways
i
neither
make
nor
mell
with
such
tulzies
which
are
for
young
lusty
folk
at
any
after
a
little
riding
in
silence
and
thought
he
asked
me
if
i
had
ever
spoken
to
gilbert
kennedy
of
bargany
and
it
was
with
a
loath
heart
that
i
answered
then
he
spoke
long
of
him
and
his
noble
prowess
comparing
him
to
the
earl
of
cassillis
to
his
great
i
grant
it
was
easy
enough
to
do
but
since
i
could
not
wear
a
man
s
signet
ring
on
my
finger
and
deny
him
even
by
my
silence
i
spoke
up
for
my
colours
and
that
is
good
enough
religion
as
i
read
it
i
am
cassillis
man
said
i
with
my
hand
on
my
sword
and
i
care
not
who
knows
hush
you
young
sir
replied
the
laird
of
auchendrayne
soothingly
mind
that
you
are
now
in
an
enemy
s
country
i
warrant
that
currie
of
kelwood
has
travelled
this
road
not
so
long
before
i
am
not
one
who
cares
whether
folk
know
my
opinions
i
cried
see
i
wear
them
on
my
collar
and
i
have
on
my
finger
a
double
whereupon
i
let
him
see
the
rings
drawing
off
my
gauntlet
that
i
might
show
him
the
signets
then
he
redoubled
his
respect
and
rode
nearer
to
me
which
made
me
glad
that
i
had
showed
him
the
seals
with
their
crests
you
are
young
to
ride
so
far
alone
on
such
great
folk
s
business
he
said
softly
even
i
that
am
old
and
sober
am
not
so
laird
auchendrayne
i
replied
to
him
you
do
jest
with
me
because
of
my
youth
for
you
yourself
are
of
the
great
ones
their
kinsman
and
equal
at
muster
and
and
but
lately
in
the
earl
s
absence
bailzie
of
carrick
then
he
went
on
to
speak
of
the
earl
mocking
at
him
as
one
for
land
and
siller
like
his
father
and
warning
me
that
when
he
had
done
with
me
he
would
cast

king

he

to
have

earldom

he
hushed
his
voice
and
leaned
towards
me
setting
his
hand
on
the
arch
of
dom
nicholas
s
neck
and
that
he
whispered
will
mean
knighthood
and
an
a
fair
maid
with
a
tocher
to
every
good
man
that
can
draw
a
sword
and

company

of
that
be
not
hasty
man
i
tell
you
bargany
will
crumple
up
cassillis
as
i
crumple
this
bit
of
and
he
threw
a
crushed
sheet
of
writing
into
doon
water
as
we
rode
beside
it
then
i
faced
about
upon
him
and
set
myself
very
straight
in
the
saddle
sir
i
said
you
are
an
older
man
a
richer
man
a
better
learned
man
than
i
but
let
me
tell
you
sir
that
i
am
an
honester
man
than
you
and
maybe
i
shall
win
though
none
the
worse
of
that
at
the
long
and
last
but
if
what
i
have
said
offend
you
i
am
willing
to
give
satisfaction
on
horse
or
foot
now
or
again
either
to
you
or
to
any
younger
man
of
your
name
i
bid
you
sir
for
i
count
you
not
good
company
for
leal
and
with
that
i
turned
my
back
on
him
and
rode
on
my
way
go
your
own
gate
he
said
rather
regretfully
than
angrily
you
have
thrown
away
a
kindly
offer
for
an
old
song
and
a
sounding
phrase
you
are
a
mettle
lad
but
with
much
wind
in
your
so
i
rode
on
thinking
that
i
had
done
with
was
very
far
indeed
from
being
the
case
of
now
the
place
where
i
took
my
leave
of
that
pleasant
reputable
john
mure
of
auchendrayne
was
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
dalrymple
bridge
where
it
strides
across
doon
water
i
am
persuaded
that
when
i
left
him
a
little
behind
i
saw
him
heave
up
his
hand
for
i
got
just
a
waft
of
it
with
the
tail
of
my
eye
yet
though
i
could
not
swear
it
in
any
court
in
the
land
unless
absolute
need
were
i
am
still
persuaded
in
my
mind
as
much
as
i
was
then
that
the
douce
and
gracious
man
intended
that
i
should
fall
into
an
ambush
if
i
proved
overly
for
his
projects
and
temptings
so
as
i
came
near
to
the
i
looked
very
warily
about
and
methought
that
i
spied
the
black
muzzle
of
a
hackbutt
where
there
was
no
need
of
such
like
now
hackbutts
do
not
even
in
carrick
grow
on
hedges
though
in
these
days
a
man
might
somewhat
easily
make
the
mistake
of
thinking
so
i
judged
therefore
that
there
would
be
an
ugly
face
behind
the
gun
and
a
finger
on
the
slow
match
that
intended
me
no
good
as
i
paused
turning
about
on
my
saddle
i
saw
a
fellow
rise
out
of
the
before
me
and
run
like
a
rabbit
to
the
that
was
enough
for
me
fighting
is
well
enough
and
i
can
be
doing
with
it
for
it
is
the
path
of
glory
and
of
fortune
but
black
treachery
i
can
not
stomach
so
being
mightily
angry
but
resolved
like
steel
to
show
john
mure
and
his
butchers
that
i
despised
them
i
turned
dom
nicholas
s
head
and
set
him
straight
at
the
deeps
of
doon
water
where
ford
there
was
none
in
a
moment
we
were
splashing
in
the
pool
and
in
another
dom
nicholas
had
thrown
back
his
head
and
taken
to
the
swimming
like
a
duck
it
was
but
a
little
way
across
but
far
enough
for
me
for
i
saw
the
fellows
running
along
the
bank
from
the
end
of
the
bridge
blowing
on
their
matches
and
bidding
me
stop
now
that
was
not
a
likely
thing
for
me
to
do
being
praise
the
lord
in
my
sober
senses
but
when
i
got
to
the
other
shore
and
set
my
horse
to
climb
the
steep
which
was
by
a
mill
on
the
waterside
i
was
somewhat
dashed
to
find
one
sitting
quiet
on
his
horse
within
ten
paces
of
me
with
his
fingers
on
his
sword
and
his
pistol
bended
in
his
hand
i
apprehended
in
a
moment
that
this
must
be
james
mure
the
younger
of
auchendrayne
and
i
thought
that
i
was
as
good
as
dead
yet
i
held
up
my
hand
and
cried
herald
and
though
i
knew
that
with
such
men
as
the
mures
i
might
just
as
well
and
usefully
have
cried
bubbly
jock
or
pigeon
pie
the
young
man
in
who
sat
his
horse
above
me
did
not
move
nor
lift
his
weapon
to
fire
tell
me
he
said
calmly
who
may
you
be
that
cries
and
herald
on
the
lands
of
kerse
i
answered
him
that
i
was
launcelot
to
effectuate
something
with
him
i
added
of
for
i
thought
it
was
unlikely
that
he
would
know
the
hill
country
well
enough
to
remember
that
my
father
was
still
alive
which
i
take
to
have
been
an
innocent
enough
deception
in
that
it
hurt
no
one
and
in
this
i
was
right
for
he
answered
at
once
i
am
david
crauford
the
younger
of
kerse
but
what
said
you
of
so
i
showed
him
the
rings
and
told
him
that
my
business
lay
by
word
of
mouth
with
his
father
thereafter
i
laid
before
him
the
matter
of
the
scoundrels
running
at
me
nigh
to
dalrymple
bridge
indeed
we
could
even
then
see
them
retiring
in
a
group
let
us
ride
to
the
bridge
head
now
and
see
if
they
will
molest
us
and
this
we
did
but
none
stirred
nor
showed
themselves
so
he
said
let
us
ride
on
to
as
we
went
our
way
we
had
much
excellent
discourse
of
the
news
of
the
countryside
and
also
of
edinburgh
and
its
customs
i
found
david
crauford
a
fine
and
brave
fellow
and
regretted
heartily
that
he
was
not
on
our
side
of
the
thing
which
indeed
i
was
too
apt
to
do
i
considered
it
an
unfair
thing
that
all
the
shavelings
should
be
ours
and
all
the
paladins
theirs
yet
i
was
comforted
by
the
thought
that
it
was
easier
to
be
distinguished
among
the
men
of
cassillis
than
with
in
the
kingdom
of
the
blind
the
man
is
king
as
the
saw
hath
it
thus
we
came
at
last
to
the
place
of
kerse
it
was
a
handsome
tower
with
additions
that
made
it
almost
a
castle
standing
upon
a
rising
ground
by
a
loch
and
overlooked
at
a
safe
distance
by
some
high
rocks
and
scaurs
which
david
crauford
told
me
were
called
the
craigs
of
kyle
it
was
the
slowest
time
of
the
afternoon
when
we
arrived
at
the
ancient
strength
and
david
saying
that
his
father
might
not
be
wakeful
slipped
on
ahead
in
order
to
assure
me
a
proper
at
least
he
said
and
at
the
doorway
i
was
met
by
many
with
pikes
in
their
hands
and
feathers
in
their
bonnets
and
there
came
forth
to
meet
me
eight
of
the
twelve
brothers
of
kerse
all
bareheaded
and
with
swords
at
their
sides
in
the
background
i
could
see
the
cause
of
my
adventuring
currie
the
laird
of
and
smirking
like
a
french
but
i
never
so
much
as
looked
his
way
from
whom
come
you
and
in
peace
or
war
said
david
crauford
just
as
though
i
had
not
told
was
quite
right
and
proper
for
these
commissions
of
diplomacy
should
be
carried
out
with
decorum
and
observance
i
come
said
i
from
the
earl
and
also
from
the
tutor
of
cassillis
and
am
commissioned
to
speak
with
the
laird
of
kerse
in
their
name
and
on
their
with
that
i
was
conducted
through
a
lesser
into
a
greater
hall
at
the
upper
end
of
which
was
a
raised
platform
two
feet
or
so
above
the
floor
the
hall
and
dais
were
alike
strewed
with
yellow
bent
grass
such
as
grows
upon
the
sides
of
the
hills
and
on
the
seashore
on
the
dais
stood
a
great
oaken
chair
with
a
hood
about
it
and
in
it
there
sat
the
noblest
old
man
that
ever
i
saw
he
seemed
by
his
beard
and
hair
to
be
ninety
years
of
age
at
the
least
yet
his
natural
colour
was
in
his
cheek
and
he
was
gleg
both
to
hear
and
to
speak
so
they
introduced
me
and
i
went
up
to
the
old
man
of
kerse
to
show
my
credentials
bending
my
knee
but
not
near
to
the
ground
in
token
of
courtesy
come
hither
david
and
tell
me
what
are
the
posies
on
the
so
david
came
near
and
looking
at
my
hand
he
read
that
motto
of
the
earl
of
a
it
read
ay
ay
that
will
do
let
the
lad
speak
his
message
said
the
old
man
then
in
the
midst
of
craufords
i
set
myself
with
my
shoulders
squared
and
my
hand
on
my
hip
to
speak
the
message
of
my
lord
i
do
not
deny
that
i
liked
the
job
well
enough
for
it
was
the
sort
which
enables
a
man
to
make
a
to
stand
alone
among
a
host
of
enemies
and
speak
a
challenge
of
defiance
master
david
crauford
laird
of
kerse
and
skeldon
said
i
giving
out
his
titles
like
a
herald
i
bear
you
greeting
and
worship
from
john
earl
of
cassillis
and
sir
thomas
kennedy
of
culzean
tutor
of
that
the
old
man
bowed
in
token
of
respect
for
the
formal
courtesy
my
principals
bid
me
say
that
they
request
and
demand
as
their
right
that
you
shall
deliver
up
to
them
the
laird
of
kelwood
their
liege
vassal
presently
rebel
and
fugitive
and
also
that
you
render
back
the
box
of
treasure
and
the
stones
of
price
which
they
have
good
reason
to
believe
their
vassal
aforesaid
hath
concealed
with
you
these
things
being
done
they
assure
you
of
their
friendship
and
support
in
all
your
so
i
gave
it
out
clearly
formally
dispassionately
and
without
heat
as
one
that
is
accustomed
to
high
commissions
as
i
spoke
i
saw
the
old
man
grip
his
staff
as
though
it
had
been
a
sword
and
ere
i
had
done
he
had
half
risen
from
his
seat
as
though
he
would
have
struck
me
to
the
ground
and
you
dare
you
beardless
birkie
to
bring
such
a
message
to
crauford
of
kerse
in
his
own
hall
and
among
his
own
folk
but
i
stood
still
with
my
hand
on
my
side
as
before
looking
at
him
with
a
level
brow
knowing
that
without
a
weapon
in
my
hand
and
with
a
double
on
my
finger
i
had
by
far
the
best
of
it
ay
though
there
had
been
a
thousand
craufords
in
the
hall
father
father
said
david
from
behind
as
one
accustomed
to
soothe
the
old
man
s
anger
i
ken
bravely
the
laddie
has
to
bring
his
message
but
scraping
johnny
of
cassillis
shall
rue
this
day
tell
him
he
cried
his
voice
rising
to
a
wild
scream
that
i
have
seen
no
doit
of
the
dirty
money
which
he
howks
out
of
every
dub
with
his
swine
s
snout
the
laird
of
kelwood
indeed
i
have
with
me
and
here
he
shall
bide
while
it
likes
for
his
own
sake
for
he
is
small
credit
either
to
kennedy
or
crauford
to
his
face
i
say
it
but
because
kerse
is
an
eagle
sitting
on
high
and
it
has
not
yet
come
to
it
that
he
must
forsooth
throw
down
so
much
as
a
bone
at
the
bidding
of
i
bowed
to
the
ground
as
having
gotten
my
answer
but
i
had
another
part
of
the
piece
still
to
play
and
the
doing
of
it
liked
me
even
better
for
i
saw
that
this
time
i
should
anger
not
only
the
old
man
but
the
young
then
said
i
in
the
name
of
john
earl
of
cassillis
whom
ye
call
swine
s
snout
i
am
charged
to
tell
you
that
if
ye
will
not
deliver
the
man
and
the
thing
that
are
his
just
right
then
will
my
master
come
and
gar
ye
be
fain
to
deliver
then
there
went
a
murmur
of
scorn
and
anger
all
about
the
hall
and
the
white
locks
of
the
old
man
fairly
bristled
on
his
head
but
i
spoke
on
level
as
a
clerk
that
reads
his
lessons
hearken
ye
to
the
word
of
last
ye
refuse
he
will
come
on
lammas
day
proximate
and
in
token
of
ignominy
and
despite
he
will
tether
a
brood
sow
upon
the
lands
of
kerse
and
not
a
crauford
shall
steer
her
for
the
length
of
a
summer
s
what
a
shout
of
anger
went
up
from
about
the
hall
the
blades
of
the
young
men
fairly
blazed
from
their
sheaths
the
old
man
rose
in
his
chair
and
lifted
his
staff
by
the
middle
two
tall
servitors
that
stood
at
the
back
of
the
hall
lighting
the
dusk
with
torches
sprang
forward
ready
to
catch
him
should
his
strength
fail
there
were
at
least
thirty
swords
pointed
at
my
breast
and
one
great
lout
threatened
me
with
a
lochaber
axe
but
with
my
heart
swelling
i
stood
still
and
calm
amid
the
graceless
tumult
like
one
of
the
carven
stones
which
look
out
from
the
niches
of
crossraguel
motionless
i
stood
as
i
had
done
from
the
first
for
i
was
a
herald
with
an
earl
s
message
an
insult
an
insult
an
insult
in
the
hall
of
kerse
kill
the
black
kennedy
they
cried
gnashing
on
me
with
their
teeth
like
wild
beasts
i
declare
i
never
was
happier
in
my
life
knowing
that
i
had
made
that
day
a
figure
which
would
not
be
forgotten
and
that
my
bearing
among
them
would
be
spoken
of
over
all
carrick
and
kyle
how
i
wished
that
marjorie
kennedy
could
have
seen
me
and
i
smiled
as
i
thought
how
little
it
mattered
after
this
whether
or
no
nell
kennedy
turned
i
will
take
the
smile
off
his
black
kennedy
s
face
with
a
paik
of
this
lochaber
axe
cried
my
great
lout
but
indeed
i
smiled
not
at
him
nor
any
of
his
sept
but
at
the
thought
of
nell
kennedy
then
when
they
had
roared
themselves
out
in
anger
they
became
as
i
take
it
some
deal
ashamed
of
the
hideous
uproar
and
of
a
sudden
were
with
a
stave
thrust
in
the
joint
and
a
twist
of
the
wrist
one
may
shut
off
a
noisy
so
i
got
in
my
last
word
thereafter
john
earl
of
cassillis
bids
me
say
that
he
will
leave
not
one
standing
stone
in
the
house
of
kerse
upon
another
for
the
despite
and
contempt
done
to
him
as
its
then
the
loud
anger
gave
place
to
silent
deadly
hate
and
it
was
some
time
before
any
could
speak
david
the
younger
would
have
spoken
but
his
father
waved
him
down
fighting
for
utterance
hear
ye
sir
and
bear
this
message
and
defiance
to
your
master
he
has
put
a
shame
on
us
in
this
our
own
house
tell
him
that
he
may
bring
his
swine
to
kerse
every
lammas
day
and
fetch
with
him
every
swineherd
kennedy
from
every
betwixt
cassillis
and
the
inch
there
are
plenty
stout
craufords
here
in
kyle
that
can
flit
them
ay
though
this
hand
that
was
once
as
the
of
the
bruce
be
shrunken
now
and
though
i
lean
on
these
bearers
of
torches
because
of
mine
age
tell
him
that
there
are
twelve
stout
sons
behind
me
who
can
render
taunt
for
taunt
blow
for
blow
to
king
or
kennedy
and
tell
him
that
crauford
of
kerse
knows
no
overlord
in
earth
or
of
all
john
kennedy
fifth
earl
of
cassillis
then
i
bowed
as
one
might
before
some
of
the
glorious
pagan
gods
of
whom
dominie
mure
has
tales
to
tell
for
indeed
that
was
an
answer
worth
taking
back
and
being
a
man
i
know
a
man
when
it
is
given
me
to
see
him
so
with
my
face
to
him
still
and
my
bonnet
in
my
hand
i
made
my
way
off
the
dais
there
i
turned
me
about
and
as
an
earl
s
spokesman
should
set
my
steel
bonnet
on
my
head
to
go
out
alone
through
the
crowded
hall
but
the
old
man
stayed
me
launcelot
kennedy
of
kirrieoch
he
said
courteously
to
you
and
not
to
your
master
i
say
this
ye
have
well
delivered
an
ill
message
may
ye
never
get
your
fill
of
fighting
and
at
the
last
may
you
die
in
harness
i
would
to
god
ye
were
my
thirteenth
son
so
i
bowed
again
and
for
respect
i
walked
backwards
to
the
door
of
the
great
hall
with
my
head
again
bare
then
i
helmed
myself
and
passed
without
to
dom
nicholas
there
was
now
a
full
muster
of
craufords
in
the
hundred
of
them
i
should
say
at
least
but
no
murmur
arose
among
them
as
helped
by
a
groom
i
mounted
and
moved
slowly
through
the
throng
having
saluted
david
the
younger
and
his
brothers
with
my
hand
then
as
i
rode
through
the
gateway
the
feet
of
dom
nicholas
clattering
on
the
stones
i
was
aware
of
a
troop
of
twelve
that
followed
me
all
men
riding
in
order
and
i
knew
the
author
of
that
guard
it
was
david
who
had
resolved
to
see
me
safe
across
dalrymple
bridge
and
so
gave
me
the
attendance
of
a
prince
then
knew
i
how
excellent
a
thing
it
is
to
have
to
do
in
peace
or
war
with
gentlemen
for
to
do
them
justice
the
craufords
of
kerse
were
neither
landloupers
nor
ambuscaders
thomas
of
the
my
guard
of
honour
did
not
leave
me
till
i
was
within
sight
of
the
towers
of
cassillis
when
david
crauford
and
his
men
parted
from
me
with
silent
salute
nor
had
the
hiding
gentry
so
much
as
ventured
to
show
their
faces
so
i
rode
down
to
cassillis
yett
a
place
and
famous
in
story
down
a
smooth
green
mead
i
rode
to
it
at
the
gate
the
porter
a
surly
rogue
bade
me
stand
stand
thou
hang
thee
varlet
i
cried
haste
thee
and
up
with
the
gates
or
thine
ass
s
ears
shall
answer
for
it
nailed
incontinent
to
a
post
whereupon
seeing
him
wondering
and
still
wavering
i
drew
off
my
glove
and
flashed
the
earl
s
broad
signet
ring
at
him
i
declare
he
laid
hold
of
the
pulley
like
one
demented
i
trust
noble
sir
that
ye
will
not
mention
the
matter
of
my
hasty
greeting
to
my
lord
he
said
to
me
as
i
passed
for
the
rascal
was
shaking
in
every
limb
let
it
learn
you
to
be
better
scraped
as
to
the
tongue
for
the
time
to
come
i
answered
sharply
for
i
was
none
sorry
once
for
all
to
read
the
villain
a
lesson
there
is
nothing
better
than
a
man
who
worthily
and
for
his
office
s
sake
magnifies
his
office
but
there
is
nothing
more
scunnering
than
that
a
menial
knave
in
pride
of
place
should
beard
his
betters
in
the
hall
of
cassillis
while
i
waited
for
my
lord
i
met
the
old
man
of
strange
aspect
who
had
been
with
us
upon
the
red
moss
he
was
dressed
in
a
long
lank
robe
like
a
soutane
and
he
carried
a
book
with
him
very
filthy
and
tattered
in
this
he
read
or
pretended
to
read
by
whiles
muttering
and
mumbling
the
words
over
to
himself
seeing
me
stand
alone
he
came
over
and
began
to
speak
to
me
about
matters
that
i
knew
not
that
concerned
the
black
vault
of
dunure
so
i
understood
him
to
say
but
his
appearance
as
he
talked
caused
me
to
laugh
though
being
an
old
man
i
did
not
let
him
see
it
his
head
appeared
as
bald
all
about
as
is
a
hen
s
egg
but
on
the
very
crown
there
was
an
oval
place
of
a
hand
s
breadth
or
thereby
from
which
dropped
a
crest
of
hair
very
laughable
and
ludicrous
for
as
the
old
man
talked
the
silly
cockscomb
on
his
crown
waggled
and
being
toothless
his
jaw
waggled
also
so
that
the
jaw
underneath
and
the
waggling
plume
aloft
might
well
have
made
a
cat
laugh
i
am
sir
thomas
tode
he
mumbled
when
i
began
to
get
a
little
familiar
with
his
shambling
ay
me
sir
thomas
tode
he
pronounced
the
word
as
though
it
had
been
the
name
of
the
foul
beast
that
squats
on
its
belly
the
famous
sir
thomas
tode
am
ay
dear
mother
mean
christian
friends
but
a
feck
of
life
it
has
been
my
lot
to
i
thought
within
me
what
a
strange
old
this
was
to
have
the
name
and
style
of
knighthood
so
i
asked
him
what
were
his
ancestral
possessions
i
am
only
poor
sir
thomas
tode
chaplain
to
two
mighty
earls
he
said
shaking
his
head
and
waggling
his
till
he
looked
more
like
the
father
of
all
the
apes
that
ever
were
than
a
sober
cleric
even
so
he
went
on
i
was
bred
to
holy
mean
brought
up
in
ignorance
to
serve
the
whore
that
sitteth
on
the
seven
hills
i
was
chaplain
to
the
old
lord
gilbert
the
father
of
the
earl
john
that
is
ah
many
a
time
did
i
shrive
him
soundly
and
none
needed
it
more
faith
but
he
was
a
ripe
crusted
old
and
sir
thomas
tode
chuckled
a
senile
laugh
at
his
memories
of
the
bygone
wickednesses
of
the
great
faith
i
doubt
shrewdly
that
he
fries
for
it
now
for
in
these
days
there
are
no
prayers
to
hoist
men
out
of
purgatory
by
the
telling
down
of
the
good
broad
bonnet
s
the
pity
for
poor
honest
churchmen
ah
me
the
times
that
were
the
times
that
were
the
old
man
paused
a
moment
to
think
the
matter
over
and
then
very
visibly
his
mind
went
wandering
after
some
greater
and
yet
choicer
wickedness
which
he
might
retail
to
me
have
you
ever
heard
he
said
at
last
of
the
roasting
of
the
abbot
of
crossraguel
man
i
was
i
was
tode
was
there
and
turned
him
on
the
iron
brander
till
i
burned
my
fingers
and
the
ancient
rascal
beat
merrily
on
the
floor
with
his
stick
and
charked
together
his
toothless
gums
now
sit
ye
down
and
i
shall
tell
you
all
that
took
place
in
the
black
vaut
of
just
then
i
saw
a
sonsy
woman
ample
of
bosom
and
with
many
plies
of
wylicoats
pleated
and
gathered
about
her
rise
from
the
black
stair
as
dominie
mure
fables
that
venus
a
heathen
goddess
but
one
of
whose
ongoings
i
own
it
diverts
me
greatly
to
hear
did
from
the
sea
with
three
strides
she
came
across
the
hall
and
caught
sir
thomas
tode
by
the
shock
of
hair
on
his
crown
be
you
at
it
again
she
cried
i
will
give
you
your
fill
of
the
black
vaut
of
dunure
doddering
old
bletherer
that
ye
are
who
is
to
turn
my
spit
i
would
have
you
tell
me
gin
you
waste
your
time
yammering
to
wanchancy
lazybones
of
the
black
vaut
of
dunure
black
vaut
of
dunure
indeed
you
have
told
your
lies
till
i
declare
you
grow
to
believe
them
yourself
so
without
a
word
of
protest
from
the
knightly
lips
of
sir
thomas
tode
he
was
led
below
his
head
nodding
and
bowing
as
his
captor
shook
the
yellow
after
the
pair
were
gone
i
laughed
both
loud
and
long
so
that
they
had
to
fetch
me
nigh
on
a
gallon
of
strong
ale
to
recover
me
of
my
access
of
mirth
and
prepare
me
for
the
presence
of
the
earl
and
right
certainly
did
i
vow
within
my
heart
that
it
would
not
be
long
before
i
renewed
acquaintance
with
sir
thomas
and
his
tyrant
for
it
seemed
a
strange
and
merry
thing
to
sec
an
earl
s
chaplain
so
used
it
was
indeed
many
a
day
since
i
had
seen
such
sport
at
last
i
was
led
in
to
the
earl
he
sat
in
a
rich
flowered
with
gold
and
a
book
with
knobs
and
studs
of
brass
lay
open
beside
him
it
was
the
account
book
of
his
estates
and
overlordships
what
was
that
loud
mirth
i
heard
a
moment
since
he
asked
for
the
earl
john
did
not
seem
to
be
in
the
best
of
tempers
indeed
he
was
said
never
to
be
canny
to
come
near
when
he
was
in
the
same
house
as
his
wife
a
thing
passing
strange
and
but
not
wholly
without
precedent
i
answered
that
i
laughed
at
a
good
story
of
sir
thomas
tode
his
private
chaplain
my
what
he
cried
oh
ye
mean
old
tode
of
the
was
his
story
about
the
black
vault
of
dunure
and
without
stopping
for
an
answer
he
went
on
with
one
of
his
proverbs
just
as
though
he
had
not
sent
me
on
an
errand
and
that
in
peril
of
my
life
i
never
met
a
young
man
so
broadened
on
wiseacre
saws
and
proverbs
in
my
life
it
was
clean
ridiculous
though
well
enough
in
a
grandfather
no
doubt
the
loud
laughter
of
the
idle
gathereth
no
gear
said
earl
john
no
replied
i
but
since
it
cheers
the
heart
it
costs
less
than
your
good
strong
ay
but
he
said
breaking
in
and
looking
pleased
but
you
have
had
some
deal
of
that
too
i
can
smell
then
he
looked
briskly
up
as
if
delighted
with
himself
for
his
penetration
and
catching
me
with
my
hand
held
guiltily
before
my
mouth
he
smiled
well
he
said
can
you
not
come
to
the
stand
so
long
agape
what
of
your
mission
so
being
nothing
loath
i
told
him
the
whole
matter
much
as
i
have
related
it
in
this
place
and
though
at
the
beginning
he
sat
calmly
enough
to
listen
long
before
i
had
finished
he
was
striding
up
and
down
the
room
gripping
at
his
thigh
where
for
common
he
wore
his
after
all
earl
john
was
a
true
cassillis
and
neither
craven
nor
and
they
roared
upon
you
standing
still
nay
you
did
well
i
wish
it
had
been
i
man
i
will
give
you
the
horse
you
rode
upon
and
all
the
caparison
i
declare
i
will
for
which
i
thanked
him
in
words
but
in
my
heart
i
said
it
is
an
easy
present
to
give
that
which
is
your
uncle
s
and
hath
indeed
been
mine
for
then
he
seemed
to
remember
for
he
said
but
give
me
back
my
signet
ye
have
done
well
and
on
lammas
day
ye
shall
do
better
will
ye
take
a
ring
or
a
sword
for
a
keepsake
a
moment
only
i
divided
my
mind
a
ring
if
good
would
indeed
buy
many
swords
but
cassillis
was
not
the
man
to
give
a
ring
of
price
contrariwise
a
sword
was
a
thing
that
all
men
had
good
skill
of
and
for
very
shame
s
sake
a
good
sword
would
he
give
i
crave
a
sword
said
i
briefly
ye
have
chosen
like
a
soldier
i
shall
not
grudge
you
the
wale
of
swords
the
earl
made
reply
smiling
upon
me
well
pleased
so
with
that
he
went
out
into
the
armoury
and
came
back
with
the
noblest
sword
i
had
ever
seen
blade
hilt
and
scabbard
were
all
inlaid
with
scrolled
damascus
work
of
gold
thin
limned
and
never
saw
the
like
and
my
blood
leaped
within
declare
to
my
shame
nigh
as
hotly
as
it
did
when
marjorie
kennedy
kissed
me
on
the
brow
in
the
arbour
of
the
pleasaunce
at
the
house
of
culzean
buckle
it
on
and
take
it
with
you
said
the
earl
lest
looking
long
upon
it
my
heart
should
smite
me
and
i
want
it
back
so
i
thanked
him
and
presently
was
gone
without
great
ceremony
lest
indeed
it
should
be
so
stay
the
night
at
cassillis
he
cried
after
me
i
have
a
letter
to
send
to
my
eame
the
tutor
in
the
and
the
house
of
cassillis
is
not
a
great
place
for
size
to
be
so
famous
but
the
earl
has
many
castles
to
which
he
goes
to
the
grand
house
of
the
new
style
which
he
is
building
at
the
inch
and
from
which
he
means
to
assert
his
overlordship
of
the
lairds
of
galloway
which
as
i
see
it
is
likely
to
breed
him
than
if
he
had
stayed
here
at
home
and
flairdied
his
old
gammer
mistress
into
good
humour
so
leaving
his
presence
i
went
to
see
that
dom
nicholas
had
the
best
of
food
and
bedding
passing
through
the
grooms
and
in
the
bravery
of
my
damascus
sword
walking
carelessly
as
though
i
wore
suchlike
every
thing
i
liked
well
to
do
i
also
made
them
change
the
straw
for
better
though
indeed
there
was
little
to
find
fault
with
but
it
is
always
best
when
one
goes
first
into
the
stables
of
the
great
to
speak
loud
to
cry
here
sirrah
what
means
this
and
then
order
fresh
bedding
to
be
brought
and
that
instantly
thus
i
made
myself
respected
and
so
walked
out
while
the
grooms
bowed
pulling
the
while
at
my
moustache
and
pressing
upon
the
hilt
of
my
sword
so
that
the
point
stood
out
at
the
proper
angle
behind
with
my
cloak
over
it
as
i
have
said
then
on
my
way
back
to
the
house
i
must
needs
so
i
made
it
the
kitchens
where
i
found
my
tyrant
in
the
act
of
cooking
the
supper
seeing
me
lean
against
the
baking
board
dressed
so
she
came
and
brushed
me
a
place
to
sit
upon
then
she
asked
would
i
be
pleased
to
drink
a
cup
of
and
old
so
seeing
her
set
on
it
i
denied
her
not
but
sat
down
unbuckling
my
weapon
for
ease
s
sake
and
throwing
it
down
with
clank
of
blade
and
jingle
of
buckle
on
the
boards
of
the
great
deal
table
in
the
midst
the
lord
forgive
me
for
caring
so
mightily
about
these
things
and
so
little
for
going
to
church
some
good
day
doubtless
i
shall
change
about
and
in
the
meanwhile
what
would
you
were
you
that
chance
to
read
never
eighteen
and
thought
you
not
well
of
yourself
having
a
new
sword
if
not
the
lord
pity
you
it
is
little
ye
ken
but
all
the
while
i
longed
to
hear
more
of
sir
thomas
tode
and
if
it
might
be
to
see
him
so
i
asked
of
the
lady
of
the
pans
where
her
husband
was
she
set
her
thumb
over
her
shoulder
pointing
to
a
narrow
door
as
of
an
aumrie
or
wall
press
he
is
in
there
she
said
shortly
and
what
else
is
there
in
there
said
i
laughing
for
what
was
i
the
wiser
half
a
bullock
is
in
there
she
said
laughing
also
that
is
the
it
is
fine
and
caller
and
he
is
not
troubled
with
flies
upon
his
miserable
bald
the
cried
i
much
astonished
and
what
does
a
reverend
chaplain
and
a
knight
in
the
the
old
dotard
will
not
quit
his
maundering
about
the
black
vaut
of
dunure
to
every
one
that
comes
near
he
got
hold
of
a
silly
chapman
in
the
yard
that
came
with
fish
from
ayr
and
i
declare
he
must
sit
down
and
prate
by
the
hour
of
the
black
vaut
of
dunure
so
i
shut
him
up
in
the
faith
i
will
give
him
black
vaut
of
dunure
ere
i
have
done
with
him
the
black
vaut
of
cassillis
and
the
company
of
the
dinner
roast
will
set
him
and
what
says
my
lord
to
your
using
his
chaplain
so
the
lady
gazed
at
me
a
moment
in
a
kind
of
wilderment
then
she
broke
into
the
vulgar
speech
of
the
country
which
because
i
learned
to
write
english
as
those
at
the
queen
s
court
do
i
have
used
but
seldom
in
this
of
course
not
for
lack
of
knowledge
sain
me
she
said
this
may
be
a
queer
uncanny
world
but
it
is
surely
no
come
to
that
o
t
yet
that
a
wife
mauna
check
and
chastise
her
ain
man
guid
lord
wadna
be
worth
leevin
till
she
said
and
taking
a
key
from
her
pocket
she
rapidly
unlocked
the
door
of
the
sir
thomas
was
discovered
sitting
most
forlornly
within
upon
the
corner
of
a
great
chest
with
many
pieces
of
meat
depending
from
hooks
about
his
head
his
wife
reaching
in
from
the
step
took
him
by
the
of
hair
as
by
a
handle
and
pulled
him
out
upon
the
floor
of
the
kitchen
with
one
movement
of
her
arm
it
s
a
guid
s
mercy
she
cried
that
yince

papish
monk

a

wi

had
been
endeavouring
to
explain
to
myself
the
strangeness
of
the
wisp
upon
sir
thomas
s
head
but
the
words
of
his
wife
made
clear
the
matter
it
was
but
the
retarded
growth
of
his
long
fallow
tonsure
an
it
s
a
de

a
queer

sir
thomas
tode
looking
at
his
wife
with
a
cringing
shamefacedness
that
was
most
entertaining
oh
i

interrupted
his

nocht
better
than
an

on
nae

reason
than
that
it
is
the
custom
for
the
cook
in
a
decent
big
hoose
to
tak
up
wi
the
the
kitchen
began
to
fill
and
i
bethought
me
that
i
should
be
going
for
it
was
not
seemly
that
a
gentleman
and
a
squire
should
collogue
overly
long
with
all
the
orra
and
women
in
a
great
house
but
before
i
could
lift
my
sword
and
depart
there
came
in
a
dark
burly
man
with
a
eagle
s
face
on
him
his
eyes
very
close
together
and
a
contemptuous
sneer
that
was
liker
a
snarl
on
his
face
good
e
en
to
ye
john
dick
said
the
cook
mind
ye
keep
the
peace
ye
for
there
are
to
be
no
collieshangies
in
my
kitchen
a
voice
called
something
querulously
down
the
stairs
coming
the
noo
my
leddy
cried
mrs
tode
the
cook
of
cassillis
i
am
juist
pittin
on
the
and
she
vanished
up
the
stair
as
soon
as
she
was
gone
sir
thomas
appeared
to
wake
up
from
a
dream
he
looked
eagerly
around
him
she
will
no
be
back
for
a
while
he
said
i
might
have
a
chance
i
maun
tell
you
of
the
roasting
of
the
abbot
man
i
saw
was
there
i
held
him
on
the
ribs
o
the
grate
i
set
him
on
the
brander
and
poured
the
oil
on
him
that
he
might
be
roasted
in
sop
oh
man
ye
think
i
am
a
fool
ever
since
that
day
never
hae
i
been
alone
without
seeing
the
face
o
him
crying
out
for
them
to
ding
whingers
into
him
or
blaw
him
up
wi
powder
to
ease
auld
earl
girnin
at
him
like
a
wild
cat
and
hunkering
low
to
watch
with
his
hands
on
his
knees
oh
young
men
never
you
put
your
hand
to
the
torture
of
man
for
it

with
you
in
the
as

or
awake
night
or
day
i
see
the
black

o
dunure
good
life
cried
his
wife
entering
briskly
at
the
moment
is
it
possible
that
the
auld
fule
is
at
it
again
the
very
de
il
s
in
the
craitur
he
thinks
that
he
was
at
the
roastin
o
a
man
whan
a
the
roastin
he
has
done
in
his
life
has
been
turnin

spit
in
this
decent
hoose
o
cassillis
come
awa
ye
doitered
auld
loon
what
did
i
tell
ye
the
last
time
the
keepin
chamber
wi
you
and
she
caught
him
by
the
top
lock
to
lead
him
away
once
more
but
i
pled
for
him
saying
that
i
had
never
heard
of
his
fantasy
and
had
indeed
encouraged
him
to
begin
the
tall
man
who
had
been
called
john
dick
the
fellow
of
the
hateful
countenance
in
whose
eyes
there
was
the
insolence
of
challenge
at
this
point
stalked
up
to
the
table
on
which
my
sword
still
lay
he
took
it
in
his
hand
with
a
contemptuous
air
examined
the
damascus
work
of
fine
gold
and
was
about
to
draw
the
blade
from
its
sheath
that
sword
is
mine
said
i
scarcely
looking
at
the
fellow
and
does
not
leave
its
scabbard
save
when
i
draw
and
then
quoth
he
with
a
bitter
sneer
i
opine
it
will
not
do
much
damage
tis
but
a
bairn
s
plaik
at
any
rate
and
in
fit
hands
it
may
be
that
you
would
like
to
try
sirrah
said
i
slipping
my
hip
off
the
table
and
buckling
on
my
sword
with
one
movement
very
willingly
said
he
of
the
sneer
come
out
to
the
but
before
i
could
move
to
end
the
matter
there
arose
from
the
corner
where
he
had
been
lying
on
an
oaken
settle
a
tall
slender
lad
of
foreign
aspect
and
distinction
he
had
on
him
a
green
suit
like
the
royal
hunting
liveries
a
long
plain
sword
in
a
black
leather
scabbard
swung
by
his
side
launcelot
kennedy
of
kirrieoch
he
said
bowing
to
me
i
am
robert
harburgh
and
though
for
the
time
being
i
serve
here
as
little
better
than
a
cullion
i
am
yet
of
some
blood
and
kindred
therefore
i
shall
do
you
no
shame
and
you
sir
said
he
turning
to
john
dick
who
stood
lowering
being
your
equal
here
i
can
serve
your
turn
to
cross
swords
spare
this
gentleman
the
discomfort
of
defiling
his
sword
of
honour
with
such
black
ignoble
blood
as
and
with
that
he
whipped
out
a
long
straight
sword
which
glittered
in
the
firelight
john
dick
turned
up
his
lip
wickedly
so
that
we
saw
his
teeth
and
the
black
curly
fringe
of
hair
about
his
face
stood
out
till
his
visage
was
like
that
of
an
angry
ramping
bull
of
galloway
there
were
only
men
in
the
kitchen
when
the
fracas
arose
for
mistress
tode
had
gone
to
do
some
errand
for
the
countess
you
are
surely
a
stark
man
said
john
dick
to
mell
or
meddle
with
me
ken
ye
that
i
have
wounded
more
men
with
my
whinger
than
i
have
fingers
on
my
right
hand
and
how
many
may
that
be
said
the
young
man
who
had
espoused
my
cause
why
four
said
john
dick
surprised
at
the
question
then
in
a
little
while
you
shall
have
one
that
is
but
three
guard
yourself
and
there
in
the
red
dusk
of
the
kitchen
they
cleared
themselves
for
fighting
and
their
blades
met
with
so
stern
a
clash
that
sparks
were
driven
from
the
steel
but
harburgh
my
young
and
melancholy
dane
forced
the
fighting
from
the
first
driving
dick
before
him
round
the
narrow
and
enclosed
place
countering
and
attacking
with
such
dexterity
and
fury
as
i
had
never
seen
though
for
years
i
myself
had
been
a
sound
swordsman
but
such
fighting
as
this
i
saw
not
in
the
schools
which
the
king
has
set
up
in
edinburgh
to
be
used
instead
of
golf
and
siclike
foolish
games
which
the
men
of
the
east
country
love
to
play
in
their
idle
folly
and
wantonness
they
had
not
gone
far
when
my
champion
using
a
snicking
undercut
i
had
never
seen
severed
the
little
finger
of
his
opponent
at
the
second
joint
just
where
it
overlaid
the
hilt
so
that
the
tip
of
it
fell
on
the
floor
whereat
sir
thomas
tode
lifted
it
and
wrapped
it
with
care
in
two
sheets
of
clean
scrivening
paper
which
he
took
from
his
pocket
but
john
dick
who
after
all
was
a
man
though
a
and
one
only
called
a
halt
for
a
moment
and
wrapped
his
wounded
finger
in
a
napkin
drawing
the
cincture
close
with
cord
and
he
was
in
the
act
of
continuing
the
fight
and
pressing
his
adversary
for
revenge
being
resolved
to
kill
him
for
the
affront
when
with
a
loud
outcry
mistress
tode
rushed
down
the
stairs
she
seized
a
huge
spit
and
with
the
sharpened
end
so
briskly
attacked
both
the
combatants
battering
them
soundly
about
their
heads
that
they
were
compelled
to
desist
and
it
was
most
comical
to
see
these
fierce
and
confident
fighters
drop
their
swords
points
and
shield
their
heads
with
their
hands
to
ward
off
the
blows
of
the
stick
varlets
she
screamed
briskly
i
will
learn
you
to
fight
and
tulzie
in
my
kitchen
out
with
you
she
cried
giving
john
dick
the
sharpened
end
of
her
weapon
in
his
wame
out
with
you
for
it
was
your
de
il
s
temper
that
began
the
and
so
having
opened
the
door
she
fairly
thrust
him
out
into
the
night
but
she
had
not
time
to
close
it
again
before
one
whom
none
of
us
had
seen
came
within
the
circle
of
red
light
he
was
a
man
of
a
dignified
countenance
dressed
in
black
and
he
held
a
plain
staff
also
of
black
in
his
hand
on
his
head
there
was
a
broad
hat
with
a
cord
about
it
upon
his
coat
he
wore
no
ornament
save
a
broad
black
silk
collar
which
lay
upon
his
shoulders
and
over
that
again
there
fell
another
collar
of
fair
soft
linen
very
white
and
well
dressed
what
means
this
tumult
in
the
house
of
cassillis
he
asked
speaking
as
one
that
has
authority
and
has
been
accustomed
to
wield
it
unquestioned
for
many
years
now
there
was
not
a
man
there
but
longed
to
ask
and
who
may
you
be
that
speers
but
none
answered
rudely
for
the
awe
that
was
upon
them
then
at
last
robert
harburgh
said
to
him
but
courteously
sir
you
ask
of
the
tumult
it
was
a
matter
that
concerns
those
only
that
fought
upon
their
own
proper
quarrel
it
concerns
neither
you
nor
yet
my
lord
cassillis
in
whose
house
ye
presently
lead
me
to
my
lord
he
said
as
one
who
had
only
to
speak
that
the
doors
might
be
opened
but
robert
harburgh
withstood
him
and
would
not
suffer
him
to
pass
let
me
see
the
earl
of
cassillis
instantly
said
he
the
earl
is
at
supper
said
robert
harburgh
and
can
not
be
i
will
eat
with
him
said
the
stranger
calmly
then
when
some
scullion
laughed
for
of
custom
those
who
ate
with
the
earl
of
cassillis
entered
not
by
the
kitchen
door
the
unknown
made
a
gesture
of
extraordinary
contempt
and
yet
withal
of
a
marvellous
dignity
go
instantly
he
commanded
pointing
to
the
stair
door
with
his
finger
and
tell
your
master
that
robert
bruce
minister
of
edinburgh
town
would
see
him
in
the
name
of
the
lord
and
of
his
highness
the
king
of
and
robert
harburgh
who
had
just
outflouted
john
dick
the
ruffler
of
camps
bowed
before
him
and
as
for
me
i
took
my
bonnet
off
my
own
head
and
saluted
for
there
was
no
one
of
us
who
had
not
heard
of
the
famous
and
minister
to
whom
the
king
had
committed
the
rule
and
governance
of
all
the
realm
during
the
he
was
in
denmark
busy
marrying
of
his
queen
so
with
robert
harburgh
leading
and
myself
following
the
minister
passed
up
the
stair
with
due
attendance
and
into
the
supper
chamber
where
the
earl
and
countess
took
their
meal
at
even
mostly
without
speech
each
with
the
other
and
when
through
the
open
door
i
saw
the
earl
welcome
his
guest
as
he
would
have
done
the
king
himself
and
especially
when
i
heard
their
serious
and
weighty
conversation
the
thought
came
to
me
that
it
was
well
that
there
were
men
in
scotland
able
to
make
religion
so
to
be
honoured
then
again
i
laughed
thinking
of
the
mighty
difference
that
there
was
between
maister
robert
bruce
minister
of
edinburgh
and
sometime
ruler
of
scotland
and
poor
sir
thomas
tode
domestic
chaplain
to
the
earl
of
cassillis
and
the
husband
of
mary
greg
his
cook
flitting
of
the
it
was
lammas
day
and
the
strange
wager
of
battle
was
about
to
be
fought
maister
robert
bruce
who
had
composed
so
many
quarrels
and
made
so
many
more
in
the
doing
of
it
had
altogether
and
utterly
failed
to
make
up
this
one
so
he
had
passed
south
to
his
friend
and
favourer
the
laird
of
bargany
who
for
all
his
soldiership
was
ever
great
for
the
honour
of
the
kirk
i
hope
that
the
minister
of
edinburgh
made
more
of
him
than
he
made
of
earl
john
of
whom
he
gat
nothing
but
fair
speeches
and
most
indifferent
drink
which
were
indeed
in
my
time
the
staples
of
cassillis
hospitality
now
it
so
happened
that
sir
thomas
kennedy
my
master
could
not
move
from
his
chair
much
less
sit
a
horse
because
of
that
old
income
in
the
knee
which
ever
in
the
hot
season
of
the
year
caused
him
so
much
pain
and
trouble
thus
it
fell
to
me
to
lead
our
small
levy
from
the
lands
of
culzean
for
we
were
near
to
the
country
of
the
barganies
and
it
would
not
do
in
the
absence
of
an
armistice
to
denude
our
head
castle
of
all
the
fighting
men
that
were
thereabout
the
morn
of
lammas
was
one
that
promised
to
open
out
into
a
day
of
fervent
heat
for
the
mists
rose
lazily
but
did
not
dissolve
as
the
sun
climbed
the
skies
yet
it
was
a
morning
that
pleasured
me
beyond
telling
as
i
buckled
on
my
new
sword
of
price
and
rode
out
to
fight
i
am
not
averse
from
fighting
but
i
own
it
is
the
riding
out
in
array
that
i
chiefly
love
what
a
heartsome
sight
it
was
when
we
turned
our
faces
towards
cassillis
yett
and
saw
the
companies
of
kennedies
come
riding
and
running
over
every
green
upright
men
of
the
south
who
had
started
the
night
before
from
far
minnochside
and
auchneil
shoremen
who
came
over
the
edge
of
brown
carrick
pikemen
spearmen
and
hackbuttmen
together
with
a
multitude
of
limber
pranksome
lads
with
only
a
leathern
jacket
and
a
whinger
when
we
came
to
cassillis
yett
there
by
the
was
sir
thomas
tode
who
was
charged
to
tell
us
that
my
lord
had
gone
on
before
us
with
many
soldiers
and
horsemen
they
had
taken
also
with
them
a
being
a
box
with
shafts
like
a
carriage
but
without
wheels
mounted
on
a
great
brush
of
branches
and
twigs
which
stuck
out
behind
and
scored
the
ground
with
a
thousand
ruts
and
scratches
this
was
for
the
conveyance
of
the
sow
which
from
sundawn
to
sunset
was
to
be
tethered
in
despite
and
contempt
upon
the
lands
of
the
craufords
of
kerse
for
that
was
the
wager
of
battle
between
the
kennedies
and
the
craufords
the
place
where
we
found
the
earl
and
his
tethered
sow
was
well
chosen
it
was
a
piece
of
land
of
which
two
sides
were
defended
by
the
doon
water
sharply
bending
back
upon
itself
while
across
the
broad
base
of
the
triangle
there
ran
a
moss
the
beating
of
the
drums
and
the
playing
of
pipes
were
on
all
the
hills
and
so
gay
and
cheerful
was
the
scene
that
it
might
have
been
a
fair
or
a
for
the
sound
of
merrymaking
and
deray
that
there
was
all
about
the
doon
that
should
run
so
red
or
sunset
now
sparkled
pure
and
clear
in
the
light
of
morning
and
the
speckled
piets
and
pigeons
scudded
here
and
there
among
the
coppices
we
had
not
been
long
established
on
this
tongue
of
land
with
our
tethered
sow
when
there
arose
a
crying
among
the
outposts
and
word
was
brought
that
from
all
the
craigs
of
kyle
and
out
of
all
the
country
of
the
east
the
craufords
and
their
allies
were
gathering
to
the
trysted
fray
presently
we
saw
them
top
the
brae
in
ordered
companies
it
was
bonny
to
see
them
come
stringing
down
the
sides
of
the
hills
now
going
singly
like
cattle
along
a
path
in
the
steep
places
and
now
forming
into
squadrons
and
companies
on
the
plain
ground
the
sunshine
sifted
through
the
thin
clouds
as
through
a
sieve
and
made
a
strange
pale
glittering
on
their
war
gear
so
that
all
the
country
round
was
lit
up
with
little
sparkling
flashes
of
fire
like
the
wave
tops
when
the
sun
rises
out
of
the
eastern
sea
they
had
their
drums
also
though
it
was
the
latest
of
many
affronts
that
the
kennedys
had
put
holes
in
all
the
crauford
drums
which
were
in
the
town
of
ayr
upon
the
last
market
day
and
this
quarrel
also
had
to
be
settled
presently
we
could
see
all
twelve
of
the
stalwart
sons
leading
on
their
vassals
from
the
brown
hills
they
were
a
sunburnt
company
because
it
was
about
the
lammastide
when
the
muirmen
are
wont
to
be
out
all
day
at
the
watersides
at
the
winning
of
the
meadow
crop
which
is
hard
to
grow
ill
to
mow
but
worst
of
all
to
gather
into
barn
as
the
saying
goes
in
the
parts
of
the
outland
hills
it
was
nine
of
the
morning
when
the
craufords
moved
to
the
attack
all
this
while
the
loathly
sow
that
was
at
once
provocation
and
offence
lay
upon
a
little
mound
in
the
midst
of
our
camp
grunting
and
grumphing
most
filthily
the
earl
had
set
a
little
snipe
of
a
raggetty
loon
to
stir
her
up
with
a
pointed
stick
so
that
she
should
not
go
to
sleep
but
should
grunt
and
disport
herself
as
she
ought
being
thus
encouraged
the
boy
did
his
work
to
admiration
and
the
old
grouting
wretch
kept
up
such
a
snorking
and
yellyhooing
that
she
could
be
heard
almost
from
dalrymple
kirk
to
the
mains
of
kerse
then
there
was
a
pause
for
parley
of
this
i
will
not
write
at
length
because
it
was
for
the
most
part
but
rudeness
and
dirtiness
that
were
bandied
about
and
party
miscalling
the
other
for
greater
thieves
and
worse
murderers
than
their
neighbours
even
in
this
i
do
not
think
we
had
the
worst
of
it
for
john
dick
whose
was
well
healed
spat
out
oaths
as
if
for
a
wager
and
muckle
hugh
miscalled
the
craufords
in
a
voice
like
thunder
as
though
they
had
been
dogs
that
would
not
run
aright
upon
the
hillsides
of
kirriemore
in
that
dear
land
which
looks
towards
galloway
now
i
can
not
say
that
i
was
keen
of
this
particular
quarrel
for
though
there
was
some
pleasure
in
making
a
figure
in
the
great
hall
at
kerse
i
foresaw
but
a
brawling
of
clowns
and
the
splattering
of
confused
fighting
without
honour
or
chivalry
in
this
affair
of
swine
and
blundering
yet
because
i
was
there
in
the
place
of
my
knight
i
could
do
no
more
than
just
bear
the
brunt
and
abide
presently
the
craufords
came
on
with
their
horsemen
first
and
the
pikemen
behind
but
the
mounted
men
came
not
far
for
the
bog
laired
their
horses
and
they
sank
deeper
and
deeper
at
every
step
then
the
footmen
came
between
them
and
charged
up
to
our
foremost
lines
so
that
we
were
and
hard
at
it
in
a
trice
it
was
not
however
the
work
of
many
minutes
to
gar
them
turn
about
and
run
for
our
front
was
solid
and
broad
while
the
hackbutt
shooters
had
fine
rests
for
their
guns
so
that
on
a
still
day
they
could
bring
a
man
down
at
thirty
yards
or
more
a
good
many
craufords
were
already
splattering
like
wounded
waterfowl
in
the
moss
which
protected
our
front
after
this
we
had
time
to
look
across
the
doon
water
from
which
there
was
a
crying
and
lo
there
on
the
bank
stood
our
late
guest
maister
robert
bruce
the
minister
of
edinburgh
but
our
earl
was
now
too
hot
to
think
of
courtesy
so
he
bade
the
minister
stop
where
he
was
or
come
over
and
take
a
pike
by
the
end
and
this
greeting
made
me
sorry
for
he
was
a
man
with
his
long
black
cloak
and
his
noble
black
horse
which
they
say
had
once
been
the
king
s
own
charger
so
i
took
the
great
risk
of
drawing
the
earl
aside
and
urged
upon
him
that
he
should
call
a
parley
and
see
what
the
minister
wanted
this
very
reluctantly
he
did
and
we
could
hear
master
bruce
speaking
from
over
the
doon
water
clearly
as
if
he
had
been
in
his
own
pulpit
in
the
king
s
name
i
bid
you
cease
he
cried
and
in
god
s
name
i
debar
and
forbid
you
if
ye
persist
i
shall
deliver
you
to
satan
so
that
ye
may
learn
that
it
is
dangerous
to
despise
authority
hoot
toot
maister
bruce
the
days
of
curses
are
by
with
said
the
earl
and
besides
the
most
of
us
have
ta
en
a
heap
of
risks
afore
noo
we
can
e
en
afford
to
take
i
wish
to
speak
said
the
minister
with
crauford
of
then
gang
farther
up
the
waterside
and
gie
a
cry
there
s
nae
craufords
here
except
dead
anes
said
the
earl
who
had
his
daft
coat
on
him
that
day
so
that
we
feared
he
had
been
bewitched
but
the
young
men
of
the
craufords
would
have
nothing
to
say
to
him
having
as
i
suspect
no
goo
for
a
minister
meddling
in
the
bickerings
of
men
so
he
returned
and
asked
cassillis
for
one
to
take
him
to
kerse
go
launcelot
said
the
earl
and
guide
him
we
will
manage
somehow
to
keep
the
battle
up
among
us
till
you
so
nothing
loath
to
get
away
from
gruntling
horror
on
the
knowe
top
i
set
dom
nicholas
s
breast
to
the
river
and
was
beside
the
minister
in
a
trice
as
i
passed
up
the
waterside
i
came
quite
near
to
david
crauford
the
younger
he
stelled
up
the
cock
of
his
pistol
to
shoot
at
me
but
i
held
up
my
hand
i
am
going
to
the
kerse
to
see
your
father
have
you
any
word
i
cried
to
him
for
in
these
quaint
times
the
friendliness
and
complaisance
with
which
killing
was
done
will
scarce
be
with
a
jest
and
as
one
might
say
amicably
to
see
my
father
cried
david
across
the
water
ye
ll
find
him
then
tell
him
that
we
ll
flit
the
cassillis
sow
or
it
be
dark
he
turned
again
to
where
his
brothers
were
standing
in
council
looking
often
south
and
north
as
though
they
expected
some
reinforcement
then
something
came
into
his
mind
gangs
the
minister
to
kerse
wi
you
he
cried
down
the
wind
i
told
him
ay
then
said
he
laughing
he
is
likely
to
hear
my
father
at
his
i
had
at
that
time
no
inkling
of
david
crauford
s
meaning
but
before
all
was
done
i
learned
so
master
robert
bruce
and
i
rode
daintily
and
cannily
along
the
riverside
till
we
came
to
the
ford
of
the
mill
which
is
beneath
the
house
of
kerse
as
we
rode
our
horses
through
the
water
and
slowly
up
the
bank
and
even
as
we
set
our
heads
over
the
edge
we
heard
the
loud
and
wrathful
crying
of
a
voice
that
shook
the
air
it
sounded
just
as
when
straying
by
quiet
woodland
ways
one
turns
the
corner
of
a
cliff
and
comes
suddenly
upon
the
sea
edge
and
lo
the
roar
and
brattle
of
the
waves
on
the
long
beaches
as
we
neared
the
house
of
kerse
we
noted
that
the
words
rose
and
fell
swaying
like
the
voice
of
a
preacher
who
has
repeated
the
same
prayer
times
without
number
did
not
the
young
man
mention
that
his
father
was
at
his
devotion
heard
ye
ever
tell
that
he
was
a
religious
person
asked
the
minister
of
me
i
answered
him
no
but
by
all
accounts
the
contrary
i
told
him
that
i
had
once
been
in
the
house
of
kerse
and
that
none
there
including
myself
i
might
have
added
with
truth
seemed
to
be
greatly
oppressed
with
any
overload
of
the
christian
virtues
when
we
came
near
we
were
aware
of
a
wide
and
vacant
house
all
the
doors
open
to
the
wall
stables
and
barn
alike
void
and
empty
not
so
much
as
a
dog
stirring
but
from
the
house
end
that
looked
down
the
water
there
came
the
crying
of
this
great
voice
of
one
unseen
though
it
was
and
i
with
the
most
noted
minister
in
scotland
by
my
side
i
declare
that
i
felt
eerie
indeed
i
have
never
cared
for
coming
on
a
habited
house
when
it
stands
empty
with
all
the
furniture
of
service
left
where
the
folk
laid
them
down
and
finding
no
one
therein
such
a
place
is
full
of
footfalls
and
whispers
and
a
kirkyard
at
midnight
is
not
more
uncanny
at
least
not
to
my
thought
it
sounds
much
like
a
man
blaspheming
his
maker
said
the
minister
we
rode
round
an
angle
of
the
wall
where
there
was
a
flanking
tower
and
there
straight
before
us
sitting
on
a
high
oaken
chair
under
a
green
tree
was
old
david
crauford
of
kerse
his
head
thrown
forward
his
hands
clenched
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
over
which
his
sons
had
from
his
mouth
there
came
an
astounding
stream
of
oaths
and
cursings
of
which
so
far
as
one
could
grasp
it
the
main
purpose
seemed
to
be
the
sending
of
every
kennedy
that
ever
drew
the
breath
of
life
directly
and
eternally
to
the
abodes
of
the
damned
we
dismounted
leisurely
from
our
horses
and
reined
them
loosely
to
the
rings
in
the
stone
at
the
house
end
then
maister
bruce
strode
forward
and
stood
in
front
of
the
old
man
who
had
never
for
a
moment
noticed
us
nor
ceased
from
his
cursings
not
until
the
tall
and
dark
figure
of
the
minister
had
blotted
out
the
point
of
the
hill
towards
which
he
looked
did
the
old
man
intermit
his
speech
then
he
drew
his
hand
slowly
across
his
brow
and
threw
his
head
back
as
if
to
distinguish
whether
it
were
indeed
a
living
man
who
stood
before
him
i
am
robert
bruce
minister
of
the
town
of
edinburgh
said
my
companion
and
i
come
from
his
majesty
the
king
of
scotland
to
bid
you
make
an
end
of
this
evil
and
universal
regardlessness
which
has
polluted
the
whole
country
with
cruelty
and
dissension
with
public
factions
and
private
deadly
old
david
crauford
leaned
forward
in
his
chair
and
set
his
hand
to
his
ear
as
though
he
had
not
heard
a
word
of
the
minister
s
speech
what
say
ye
man
he
cried
testily
like
one
who
is
stayed
from
his
purpose
by
childish
pranks
i
say
said
the
minister
stoutly
that
the
disquieting
of
the
lieges
with
jacks
and
pistols
is
as
much
dishonouring
to
god
as
it
is
distasteful
to
his
majesty
the
hear
ye
me
my
man
hae
ye
done
said
old
david
glowering
at
him
are
you
a
christian
man
said
the
minister
sternly
or
he
added
as
if
on
second
thoughts
a
loyal
subject
of
king
james
the
sixth
christian
cried
the
old
man
with
great
indignation
do
you
speer
me
gin
i
am
a
christian
man
do
ye
no
ken
that
i
am
an
ayrshireman

proud
am
i
to

and
able
to
keep

ain
heid
and
haud
my
ain
land
again
baith
prince
and

old
man
said
the
minister
sternly
ken
ye
that
ye
speak
blasphemies
know
ye
not
that
for
every
word
ye
utter
god
shall
enter
into
judgment
with

said
david
crauford
drily
stand
oot
o
my
licht
man
i
canna
see
through
ye
gin
ye
dinna
this
pistol
will
enter
into
judgment
wi
the
minister
stepped
as
i
think
at
all
for
fear
of
the
pistol
but
despairing
of
reaching
the
conscience
of
such
a
seared
and
battered
heathen
then
suddenly
the
old
man
rose
from
his
seat
as
one
that
sees
a
heavenly
vision
his
face
appeared
transfigured
and
shining
and
with
his
white
hair
falling
on
his
shoulders
i
declare
he
looked
like
the
apostle
andrew
in
the
papish
window
of
the
high
kirk
of
edinburgh
i
see
him
i
see
him
he
cried
he
comes
with
the
tidings
of
i
looked
where
he
pointed
with
his
eyes
but
could
see
nothing
save
a
black
dot
which
seemed
to
rise
and
fall
steadily
nevertheless
the
old
man
spoke
the
truth
it
was
indeed
a
swift
rider
making
straight
for
the
house
of
kerse
as
the
man
came
nearer
we
saw
him
spur
his
horse
till
it
stumbled
and
fell
at
the
park
dykes
weary
or
wounded
we
could
not
tell
which
this
roused
david
crauford
and
he
shouted
to
the
man
who
now
came
on
lamely
on
foot
man
is
the
sow
flitted
he
cried
the
man
peching
and
blown
with
his
haste
could
not
answer
till
he
came
near
is
the
sow
flitted
again
shouted
the
old
man
oh
laird
kerse
cried
the
messenger
the
tears
trickling
down
his
face
pity
this
sorrowfu
day
there
has
been
a
waesome
slaughter
o
your
o
them
are
is
the
sow
flitted
cried
crauford
louder
than
ever
can
you
no
answer
yea
or
nay
oh
kerse
hear
me
and
weep
your
braw
and
bonny
son
jock
the
flower
of
kyle
is
stricken
through
the
heart
and
lies
cauld
and
dead
on
the
scoundrel
dolt
yammering
calf
answer
or
die
is
the
sow
flitted
the
patriarch
stood
up
on
his
feet
fiercely
threatening
the
messenger
with
his
staff
the
sow
is
flitted
cried
the
man
that
and
no
more
the
old
man
fairly
danced
in
a
whirling
triumph
cracking
his
fingers
in
the
air
with
joy
like
a
boy
my
thumb
for
jock
cried
he
the
sow
s
flitted
and
with
that
he
dropped
slack
and
senseless
upon
his
great
chair
the
minister
took
my
arm
and
led
me
to
the
stone
come
away
he
said
sadly
it
is
no
use
ephraim
hath
too
long
been
joined
to
his
idols
let
him
alone
it
is
as
guid
maister
knox
foretold
the
word
of
god
is
indeed
made
of
none
effect
in
kyle
and
tryst
at
from
robert
harburgh
i
got
the
tidings
of
the
disaster
that
had
befallen
the
cassillis
arms
soon
after
i
had
ridden
away
with
the
minister
of
edinburgh
the
craufords
were
in
no
hurry
to
come
on
in
spite
of
all
the
taunts
of
the
earl
and
the
disordered
noise
of
the
foul
beast
which
for
despite
he
had
tied
on
their
lands
but
they
kept
outposts
on
the
hills
about
and
they
looked
often
this
way
and
that
i
had
seen
them
then
began
a
waving
of
flags
and
crying
of
words
till
once
more
their
line
settled
into
place
and
from
the
north
and
the
south
at
once
fresh
bands
of
horsemen
came
riding
towards
us
and
as
they
came
nearer
the
cassillis
folk
saw
that
they
from
the
north
were
led
on
by
james
mure
the
younger
of
auchendrayne
and
from
the
south
there
came
the
band
of
outlaws
and
robbers
that
called
thomas
of
drummurchie
their
captain
on
two
sides
these
beset
us
with
only
the
river
between
and
the
craufords
began
to
gather
more
closely
than
ever
on
our
front
then
the
earl
remembered
that
what
dom
nicholas
and
i
had
done
so
easily
in
the
crossing
of
the
doon
other
men
as
determined
might
also
do
but
being
as
i
have
said
by
nature
a
brave
man
he
first
awaited
the
event
nor
was
it
long
before
at
a
given
signal
drummurchie
and
young
auchendrayne
set
their
horses
to
the
water
and
came
at
us
through
the
bends
of
the
river
in
spite
of
the
shots
that
rained
upon
them
and
the
men
that
dropped
from
their
seats
and
spun
down
the
flooded
doon
for
it
was
soon
after
the
time
of
the
lammas
floods
and
the
water
was
yet
drumlie
and
wan
in
our
front
the
craufords
raged
and
altogether
in
a
trice
our
position
was
wholly
turned
this
is
not
well
done
cried
our
earl
to
thomas
of
drummurchie
as
he
laid
stoutly
about
him
thy
brother
had
not
so
have
treated
his
chief
when
he
strove
with
the
enemies
of
the
clan
wolf
should
not
tear
wolf
nor
kennedy
kennedy
in
a
little
it
was
seen
that
the
promontory
could
not
be
kept
in
face
of
a
force
three
times
our
number
and
specially
when
those
of
our
own
name
and
ancient
alliance
were
striving
against
us
out
of
the
neck
of
the
bottle
and
keep
together
cried
the
earl
who
on
stricken
field
was
no
shaveling
so
with
that
earl
john
led
his
people
straight
across
the
water
at
the
point
of
the
land
that
jutted
between
the
forces
of
auchendrayne
that
came
from
the
north
and
drummurchie
s
desperate
riders
who
beset
us
on
the
south
so
swiftly
was
this
done
that
before
they
could
close
or
the
craufords
come
on
most
part
of
the
cassillis
folk
had
passed
doon
water
though
there
were
twenty
at
the
least
who
were
either
drowned
or
else
wounded
to
death
where
they
had
fought
the
wager
out
on
the
fair
holms
of
dalrymple
it
so
befel
as
the
minister
and
i
were
riding
home
that
we
came
on
our
little
company
of
culzean
lads
riding
with
tired
horses
and
slack
reins
shorewards
and
god
be
thanked
for
his
mercy
in
the
quarrel
that
had
been
so
evilly
settled
there
was
no
loss
to
culzean
for
we
came
not
home
with
a
single
empty
saddle
nor
was
there
so
much
as
a
pike
staff
left
behind
the
last
of
it
that
they
heard
was
the
shouts
of
the
craufords
as
they
flitted
the
sow
over
the
water
to
the
lands
of
kennedy
thus
clearing
their
own
borders
ere
set
of
sun
according
to
their
boast
and
promise
on
the
morrow
s
morn
there
came
to
each
kennedy
s
gate
a
little
squealing
pigling
with
the
cassillis
colours
of
blue
and
gold
tied
in
derision
to
its
curled
tail
and
round
its
neck
was
this
motto
the
flitted
sow
of
cassillis
hath
pigged
and
crauford
of
kerse
sends
the
litter
home
and
so
in
like
manner
was
done
at
the
house
of
every
kennedy
that
had
men
at
the
fight
of
the
whether
they
lived
near
or
far
but
who
left
them
at
the
yetts
none
saw
all
which
was
more
likely
to
be
a
ploy
of
thomas
of
drummurchie
or
john
mure
s
than
of
the
to
do
them
justice
had
small
skill
in
aught
save
hard
strokes
but
plenty
of
that
for
even
to
this
day
there
is
small
civility
or
scholarship
about
kyle
stewart
and
king
s
kyle
now
there
was
no
mistaking
but
that
we
came
home
with
our
fingers
in
our
mouths
and
the
countryside
jeers
at
us
of
cassillis
and
culzean
were
many
as
the
leaves
of
the
summer
trees
nor
could
i
win
belief
that
i
had
been
by
command
of
the
earl
at
the
house
of
kerse
along
with
the
minister
instead
of
on
the
green
inch
of
dalrymple
by
skeldon
haughs
for
believe
it
who
will
there
are
many
right
willing
to
have
a
catch
at
me
though
god
knows
i
had
never
gone
out
of
my
way
to
put
a
slight
upon
any
man
nor
yet
thought
more
highly
of
myself
than
i
ought
to
think
in
time
however
the
bitterness
died
down
and
at
culzean
things
went
their
wonted
quiet
way
it
is
true
that
nell
kennedy
never
so
much
as
looked
the
way
i
was
on
i
heard
that
she
went
about
telling
everyone
whom
she
thought
would
carry
the
tale
to
me
that
i
had
gotten
the
earl
s
sword
for
procuring
the
sow
of
skeldon
and
carrying
her
over
doon
water
on
my
back
but
this
was
no
more
than
spite
easily
seen
through
and
i
minded
it
not
for
everyone
in
carrick
knew
the
cause
why
i
had
gotten
the
blade
from
the
earl
who
indeed
is
not
a
man
to
give
aught
for
naught
nor
yet
to
bestow
where
with
honour
he
might
withhold
but
to
balance
the
beam
marjorie
was
kinder
to
me
than
ever
she
had
been
so
that
i
thought
of
a
surety
that
her
heart
had
at
last
been
touched
by
love
but
as
it
chanced
i
was
to
get
news
of
that
before
i
was
greatly
older
as
the
thing
fell
out
one
night
i
had
been
somewhat
late
out
of
bed
visiting
of
a
friend
whose
name
it
does
not
advantage
to
set
down
here
and
in
the
morning
while
yet
it
was
dark
i
was
returning
by
the
rough
shore
tracks
to
the
coves
from
whence
i
had
to
clamber
warily
up
in
order
to
reach
my
ladder
of
rope
which
depended
as
of
old
from
the
overhanging
turret
of
the
white
tower
as
i
stood
to
breathe
a
while
in
the
quiet
of
the
cove
i
was
aware
of
voices
that
spoke
above
me
for
the
sea
was
quiet
and
the
moon
dipping
down
to
the
setting
my
thoughts
were
running
at
the
time
on
for
among
the
things
i
had
had
on
my
mind
that
night
there
was
the
matter
of
the
losing
of
the
kelwood
treasure
in
the
house
of
the
red
moss
thinking
that
i
might
learn
something
of
importance
i
hasted
to
clamber
in
the
direction
from
which
came
the
voices
and
as
i
glided
along
the
foot
of
the
rocks
in
the
black
shadow
i
came
almost
without
warning
upon
two
who
stood
close
together
i
could
not
go
back
i
could
not
go
forward
i
could
only
retreat
sideways
as
far
as
the
rock
would
let
me
and
even
then
i
stood
within
a
few
feet
of
the
speakers
at
the
first
words
i
knew
them
it
was
marjorie
kennedy
of
culzean
talking
with
gilbert
of
bargany
the
enemy
of
her
house
and
of
us
all
the
blood
settled
sharply
chill
about
my
heart
and
the
bitterness
of
death
seemed
to
come
upon
me
the
maid
to
whom
my
heart
had
gone
out
to
whom
i
had
looked
up
as
my
liege
lady
was
standing
here
in
midnight
converse
with
the
sworn
enemy
of
her
race
and
of
her
father
but
i
had
no
time
for
for
deciding
what
i
should
do
i
was
no
eavesdropper
yet
for
my
life
i
could
not
go
forth
and
confront
them
i
could
hear
gilbert
kennedy
s
words
they
were
pleading
and
passionate
words
hear
me
listen
to
me
marjorie
he
said
and
i
could
see
his
uncovered
head
turned
towards
her
where
she
stood
black
between
me
and
the
sea
i
love
no
one
but
you
i
have
sought
none
but
you
ever
since
i
was
a
stripling
lad
like
your
young
launcelot
kennedy
have
not
i
given
you
worship
and
service
why
then
do
you
hate
me
despise
me
turn
away
from
me
as
i
listened
my
heart
rose
again
in
hope
your
launcelot
kennedy
he
had
said
it
might
be
that
i
even
i
was
the
cause
why
marjorie
turned
from
him
as
he
said
gilbert
said
marjorie
kennedy
and
her
voice
was
like
the
still
waters
of
a
sheltered
sea
lapping
on
the
wet
sands
i
do
not
turn
from
you
i
am
not
proud
with
you
if
i
were
would
i
be
here
but
in
spite
of
this
i
am
trysted
to
another
fate
if
there
is
to
be
any
use
in
my
life
it
is
that
i
may
become
the
sacrifice
that
is
to
compose
this
quarrel
and
it
can
not
be
with
you
for
and
wherefore
not
said
bargany
fiercely
striking
one
hand
into
the
hollow
palm
of
the
other
marjorie
put
out
one
of
her
own
hands
as
if
to
restrain
him
i
will
put
you
to
the
test
said
she
if
i
were
lady
bargany
would
you
submit
to
john
earl
of
cassillis
and
be
his
man
setting
aside
all
your
ancient
quarrels
and
acknowledging
him
as
your
liege
lord
god
forbid
said
bargany
promptly
marjorie
put
out
her
other
hand
for
him
to
take
and
i
like
you
the
better
for
it
gilbert
she
said
impulsively
bargany
set
her
fingers
to
his
lips
and
held
her
hands
as
if
he
could
never
let
them
go
then
said
she
since
this
bitter
strife
and
the
killing
of
friends
must
somehow
be
stopped
and
since
you
would
not
stop
it
even
for
am
i
that
i
should
not
be
at
my
father
s
command
to
give
and
to
take
to
be
sold
and
bought
like
a
beast
in
the
who
talks
of
buying
and
selling
interrupted
bargany
roughly
give
me
but
a
look
of
your
eyes
and
i
will
carry
you
to
my
house
of
bargany
and
see
if
any
dare
to
take
you
from
the
safe
keeping
of
gilbert
and
my
father
said
she
speaking
very
quietly
but
clearly
so
that
i
heard
every
word
your
father
answered
bargany
is
a
good
good
for
such
a
crew
he
has
married
one
daughter
to
the
young
sheriff
of
galloway
wherefore
not
another
to
his
cousin
of
bargany
is
not
kennedy
of
bargany
even
though
he
be
an
enemy
better
than
any
noltish
galloway
laird
ah
said
marjorie
kennedy
softly
but
there
is
another
tell
it
me
and
i
will
answer
it
said
bargany
with
a
swift
fierceness
for
i
think
he
imagined
that
he
was
making
head
against
her
scruples
but
i
had
heard
her
speak
in
that
still
way
before
and
could
have
told
him
different
isobel
stewart
to
the
queen
and
the
earldom
of
are
surely
reasons
enough
said
marjorie
kennedy
bargany
started
as
though
an
adder
had
stung
him
for
a
moment
he
seemed
bereft
of
speech
who
has
been
lying
to
you
of
me
he
said
almost
under
his
breath
as
though
the
night
air
had
suddenly
made
him
hoarse
nay
think
again
said
marjorie
is
it
not
true
better
a
soiled
of
the
king
s
court
and
an
earldom
with
her
than
poor
marjorie
kennedy
of
culzean
in
her
smock
i
never
heard
her
say
a
spiteful
thing
before
nor
when
it
comes
to
the
matter
of
the
other
woman
all
women
are
alike
bargany
stamped
his
foot
in
very
anger
a
fig
for
dignities
and
a
rotten
fig
for
isobel
stewart
he
cried
i
love
but
you
marjorie
kennedy
will
you
come
to
me
so
that
you
and
i
may
face
the
world
together
for
it
is
a
black
world
and
needs
two
hearts
that
can
stand
by
each
then
betwixt
me
and
the
sea
as
i
have
said
i
saw
marjorie
knitting
and
clasping
her
hands
as
if
her
spirit
were
wrestling
within
her
yea
gilbert
she
said
very
gently
at
last
it
is
as
you
say
a
black
black
world
but
neither
you
nor
i
are
going
to
better
it
by
the
breaking
of
trysts
and
engagements
and
what
tryst
have
you
he
demanded
sullenly
i
am
trysted
to
sorrow
she
answered
trysted
for
ever
to
want
that
which
most
i
desire
and
to
have
that
which
most
i
hate
gilbert
kennedy
take
my
hand
this
once
and
hearken
you
and
i
are
too
greatly
like
one
another
to
be
happy
together
we
are
not
mates
born
for
smooth
things
sorrow
is
our
dower
and
suffering
our
weird
and
the
pity
of
it
is
that
we
must
dree
it
apart
i
think
we
are
both
fey
she
said
breaking
off
with
a
change
of
tone
we
had
best
go
within
said
bargany
scornfully
for
he
bethought
him
that
he
could
never
enter
the
house
of
culzean
as
a
friend
now
gilbert
said
marjorie
be
a
man
and
forgive
be
a
man
also
to
isobel
stewart
that
she
may
know
you
a
truer
man
than
she
has
ever
met
in
king
s
truer
and
nobler
as
i
think
you
than
the
king
himself
and
let
me
go
my
way
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
stood
a
space
silent
and
bowed
let
me
go
my
way
she
said
again
and
so
would
have
gone
from
him
but
gilbert
kennedy
had
her
in
his
two
arms
and
was
kissing
her
mouth
and
that
often
and
passionately
no
he
said
i
will
not
let
you
go
i
will
take
you
in
spite
of
there
were
at
culzean
a
thousand
cassillis
a
thousand
earls
she
withdrew
herself
from
him
with
quiet
dignity
yet
without
anger
but
you
will
not
take
me
in
spite
of
one
marjorie
kennedy
she
said
then
at
this
quick
as
a
musket
flash
bargany
turned
on
his
heel
and
tramped
angrily
down
the
shingle
of
the
shore
his
sword
clanking
and
his
spurs
ringing
as
careless
who
might
hear
as
if
he
had
been
crossing
the
paved
court
of
his
own
house
of
bargany
and
marjorie
kennedy
stood
still
and
watched
him
go
her
hands
pressed
to
her
bosom
as
though
it
needed
both
to
still
the
dreadful
beating
of
her
heart
i
love
him
i
love
him
she
cried
to
the
stillness
when
he
was
quite
gone
oh
that
he
might
trample
me
that
his
hand
might
slay
me
so
that
in
death
he
might
lift
up
my
head
and
say
once
again
i
love
you
and
so
she
also
passed
away
within
then
i
in
my
corner
where
i
had
been
an
unwilling
hearkener
set
my
face
between
my
knees
and
thought
that
the
world
would
never
be
bright
again
for
i
had
heard
that
which
i
had
heard
and
i
knew
now
that
marjorie
my
lady
marjorie
would
never
know
love
for
me
while
the
world
lasted
nevertheless
i
rose
up
and
clambered
aloft
to
reach
my
rope
ladder
i
climbed
over
the
rocks
thoughtlessly
heedlessly
and
i
scraped
my
shoe
so
that
it
sounded
loud
in
the
still
night
suddenly
i
saw
something
bright
above
me
the
flicker
of
a
white
robe
i
had
nearly
fallen
thinking
that
the
appearance
might
be
a
spirit
of
the
darkness
dinna
be
feared
said
a
voice
i
knew
well
it
is
only
nell
kennedy
think
ye
that
none
can
climb
up
the
w
hite
tower
besides
yourself
i
was
so
greatly
astonished
that
i
could
not
speak
at
once
what
may
you
be
doing
there
at
this
time
of
the
morning
nell
i
said
at
last
just
like
to
find
a
quiet
way
to
my
bed
said
she
but
i
must
hasten
or
i
shall
be
late
to
let
in
what
marjorie
said
i
pretending
that
i
knew
nothing
of
the
matter
lie
to
other
folk
gin
ye
like
spurheel
said
the
madcap
contemptuously
but
dinna
think
ye
can
lie
to
nell
kennedy
i
saw
ye
come
from
the
hole
down
by
the
but
what
do
you
here
nell
said
i
for
it
might
be
that
the
mad
lassie
had
a
lad
and
it
seemed
a
terrible
thing
that
she
should
be
so
misguided
at
her
age
as
to
meet
him
alone
by
night
maybe
i
was
down
by
seeing
kate
allison
the
grieve
s
lassie
said
she
do
you
honestly
think
spurheel
that
helen
kennedy
would
permit
a
sister
of
hers
to
gang
jooking
here
and
there
about
the
shore
wi
a
bonny
young
man
at
the
dead
of
nicht
all
by
her
lone
it
is
not
very
i
said
no
more
it
was
not
easy
to
with
nell
kennedy
and
now
betake
yourself
up
the
rope
to
your
garret
she
said
and
i
will
follow
after
for
i
must
let
our
maidie
in
by
the
east
door
or
it
grows
i
motioned
her
to
go
first
but
she
turned
on
me
in
great
indignation
hear
ye
spurheel
up
wi
ye
and
if
ye
so
much
as
set
your
nose
oot
o
your
window
when
i
am
on
the
rope
it
will
no
be
telling
so
i
climbed
up
and
the
window
and
long
before
i
was
settled
in
bed
i
heard
the
two
sisters
talking
softly
together
in
the
room
beneath
so
i
knew
that
nell
kennedy
had
carried
out
her
mad
ploy
adventure
of
the
i
need
not
tell
all
the
reasons
why
my
and
kindly
master
sir
thomas
kennedy
had
grown
to
be
hated
with
a
deadly
feud
by
all
the
of
the
bargany
faction
saving
indeed
by
gilbert
kennedy
of
bargany
himself
for
one
thing
my
master
was
the
man
of
the
best
and
wisest
counsels
among
all
the
supporters
of
cassillis
he
had
many
virtues
being
wherever
he
went
for
kindliness
and
courteousness
also
he
was
a
man
of
good
principles
and
religion
so
far
as
the
times
permitted
and
indeed
somewhat
beyond
as
he
found
to
his
own
bitter
cost
or
all
was
done
still
more
my
master
culzean
was
never
one
to
suspect
evil
of
any
man
and
was
ever
prone
to
cover
wrack
and
ruin
by
and
graciousness
the
first
act
of
a
great
and
wide
conspiracy
to
compass
his
death
was
now
to
be
played
for
thomas
of
drummurchie
the
brother
of
young
bargany
was
not
of
so
lofty
a
spirit
as
his
chief
indeed
to
speak
plainly
he
was
no
better
than
an
assassin
and
a
common
bully
he
caused
all
the
to
lie
in
terror
for
fear
of
him
being
great
with
none
save
only
with
the
lairds
of
auchendrayne
was
a
strange
thing
considering
their
outward
profession
of
strict
honour
it
happened
that
there
was
a
worthy
knight
an
indweller
in
the
town
of
maybole
sir
thomas
nisbett
by
name
who
was
a
crony
of
my
master
culzean
now
it
was
the
practice
for
the
gentry
of
the
neighbourhood
during
the
winter
to
enter
in
and
dwell
within
the
town
of
maybole
in
many
pretty
and
houses
of
freestone
diverting
themselves
during
the
dead
time
of
the
year
with
converse
together
in
each
other
s
houses
these
stand
for
the
most
part
in
the
chief
street
of
maybole
and
have
fine
gardens
attached
to
them
of
them
all
that
of
the
earl
of
cassillis
is
the
largest
but
the
one
belonging
to
my
master
culzean
is
but
little
behind
it
in
beauty
and
convenience
but
sir
thomas
kennedy
bode
little
about
his
house
in
maybole
chiefly
because
his
lads
and
lasses
loved
most
to
remain
at
culzean
where
the
cliffs
are
and
the
sea
spreads
wide
clattering
pleasantly
on
the
rocks
and
with
the
birds
blithely
swirling
and
diving
about
it
all
the
year
round
and
of
this
i
also
was
glad
for
to
live
in
a
town
is
a
thing
i
can
not
abide
for
any
long
time
being
bred
to
the
life
of
the
hills
and
to
the
wind
in
my
face
now
on
this
new
year
s
day
it
so
happened
that
this
sir
thomas
nisbett
had
invited
my
master
being
as
i
say
a
crony
of
his
own
and
of
an
age
with
him
to
sit
down
at
supper
in
his
house
in
maybole
so
culzean
took
horse
and
a
small
attendance
of
whom
i
was
the
chief
and
rode
over
to
bide
the
night
in
maybole
town
meaning
to
lodge
in
his
own
house
and
in
the
morning
return
to
his
castle
of
culzean
my
master
was
a
mightily
curious
man
in
one
particular
he
could
not
abide
any
repair
of
people
coming
and
going
with
him
on
his
journeyings
and
if
in
a
quieter
time
he
had
gotten
his
will
he
would
have
ridden
here
and
there
without
any
attendance
kindly
and
unsuspicious
of
evil
was
his
nature
on
the
new
year
night
he
had
bidden
me
to
remain
within
doors
because
as
he
said
he
knew
his
way
home
full
well
from
sir
thomas
nisbett
s
house
also
i
suspect
he
wished
me
not
to
observe
whether
he
retained
his
usual
walk
and
conversation
after
seeing
the
new
year
in
with
the
provost
and
the
other
sir
thomas
for
the
custom
of
maybole
was
exceedingly
hospitable
new
year
s
day
had
been
dark
and
gloomy
the
promise
of
oncoming
foul
weather
was
in
the
feel
of
the
raw
drooky
air
no
sooner
was
it
dark
than
a
smurr
of
rain
began
to
fell
very
wetting
and
thick
so
that
even
with
torches
it
had
been
impossible
to
see
many
paces
we
reached
our
lodging
at
the
town
house
of
culzean
before
the
night
had
set
in
and
as
the
supper
was
at
six
of
the
clock
it
was
no
long
time
before
my
master
took
his
way
to
sir
thomas
nisbett
s
house
he
left
me
seated
by
the
fire
with
a
book
of
chronicles
of
the
wars
to
read
as
soon
however
as
he
had
issued
forth
upon
the
street
i
took
my
bare
sword
in
my
hand
and
by
another
door
i
sallied
forth
also
for
in
such
a
town
as
maybole
there
are
always
folk
that
would
gladly
do
an
injury
to
a
and
man
like
my
master
and
much
more
now
when
the
feud
had
waxed
so
hot
and
high
but
it
chanced
that
sir
thomas
so
soon
almost
as
he
set
foot
over
the
doorstep
greeted
his
the
provost
of
the
as
became
his
office
had
with
him
one
to
hold
the
tail
of
his
furred
gown
out
of
the
clarty
mud
and
also
a
lad
with
a
torch
running
before
him
nevertheless
i
followed
on
in
that
darker
dusk
which
succeeds
the
glare
of
a
torch
on
our
way
we
had
to
pass
through
the
garden
behind
the
house
of
sir
thomas
nisbett
which
was
full
of
groset
bushes
divided
by
high
hedges
of
yew
and
box
i
came
softly
after
them
and
abode
still
by
the
gate
when
the
provost
and
his
train
had
passed
through
with
our
good
knight
in
their
midst
the
pair
of
them
were
talking
jovially
together
as
they
went
like
men
with
toom
kytes
that
know
they
are
going
in
to
be
filled
with
good
cheer
i
declare
i
am
as
hungry
as
a
moudiewort
in
a
black
frost
said
the
douce
provost
i
haena
seen
meat
the
day
what
wi
hearkening
to
auld
wives
denouncing
ane
anither
for
kenned
and
notour
witches
and
sending
men
of
the
tribes
of
little
egypt
to
the
tolbooth
my
life
has
no
been
my
my
master
laughed
loudly
and
heartsomely
it
is
weel
to
be
hungry
and
ken
o
meat
he
replied
in
the
words
of
the
proverb
and
the
pair
of
them
laughed
with
their
noses
in
the
air
easily
mirthful
like
men
that
strengthen
themselves
with
the
comfortable
smell
of
dinner
blown
through
an
open
door
but
i
question
much
whether
they
had
laughed
so
heartily
if
they
had
seen
what
i
saw
at
that
moment
and
that
was
a
face
looking
over
the
height
of
the
yew
face
wrapped
about
the
mouth
with
a
grey
plaid
and
with
a
grey
brimmed
hat
pulled
close
down
over
the
eyes
as
the
flickering
of
the
torch
died
out
at
the
entering
in
of
the
house
door
i
saw
the
man
raise
his
hand
in
a
warning
and
forbidding
gesture
as
though
he
made
a
signal
to
men
who
could
see
him
but
who
were
hidden
from
my
sight
this
was
enough
for
me
i
resolved
that
those
who
plotted
evil
behind
backs
should
have
to
war
with
launce
kennedy
who
at
least
was
no
mean
foe
and
one
not
given
to
wearing
his
eyes
under
his
coat
not
for
a
moment
after
this
could
i
leave
the
garden
for
one
of
the
villains
might
have
gone
to
the
window
and
shot
at
my
master
through
the
one
had
done
years
before
to
good
maister
john
knox
who
as
i
have
heard
tell
reformed
religion
in
this
land
on
an
evening
he
sat
quietly
reading
his
book
and
drinking
of
his
ale
in
his
own
house
in
the
high
street
of
edinburgh
so
i
got
me
into
an
angle
of
the
garden
and
climbed
a
wall
which
being
grown
with
ivy
was
a
good
and
safe
post
of
vantage
from
thence
i
could
overlook
the
whole
enclosure
after
a
little
my
eyes
became
better
accustomed
to
the
darkness
the
lights
from
the
windows
also
made
a
faint
glimmering
athwart
the
hedges
and
i
could
distinctly
see
men
darning
themselves
into
their
and
getting
ready
their
pistols
and
hackbutts
even
as
i
sat
there
on
the
wall
and
froze
a
plan
came
into
my
head
which
sent
the
blood
surging
through
my
veins
like
the
tide
scouring
the
gut
of
solway
i
remembered
that
sir
thomas
kennedy
was
at
no
time
very
active
on
his
legs
and
what
with
the
income
in
his
knee
and
the
good
wine
under
his
belt
he
would
assuredly
be
in
no
key
for
running
when
he
issued
forth
also
they
were
certainly
many
who
lay
in
wait
for
him
i
counted
at
least
five
moving
about
in
the
faint
light
so
i
mounted
the
top
of
the
ivied
wall
and
slid
down
the
outside
landing
heavily
on
my
hinderlands
in
a
ditch
i
stole
round
to
the
gable
door
of
nisbett
s
house
and
told
the
manservant
that
i
had
come
to
see
my
master
whereupon
they
permitted
me
to
go
up
to
the
room
on
the
first
storey
where
the
guests
were
already
set
down
at
the
banquet
i
knew
well
that
it
was
no
use
speaking
to
my
lord
but
i
did
venture
to
call
out
the
host
sir
thomas
nisbett
whose
head
was
stronger
and
whose
heart
more
readily
suspicious
than
those
of
the
laird
of
culzean
him
i
told
how
the
matter
stood
whereupon
he
wished
to
speak
to
the
provost
and
to
call
the
town
officers
but
i
assured
him
that
these
determined
assassins
in
the
yard
could
render
an
account
of
the
town
guard
twice
told
over
so
said
i
i
have
this
to
propose
to
you
in
a
word
when
the
time
comes
for
the
guests
to
depart
you
will
detain
my
the
provost
too
if
you
ere
i
have
done
with
them
they
will
not
move
far
or
my
name
is
not
thomas
nisbett
said
the
host
nodding
his
head
for
these
were
the
manners
and
hospitalities
of
the
time
and
you
will
lock
them
in
a
secure
place
till
the
morning
but
said
nisbett
will
not
the
villains
attack
my
house
if
it
be
as
you
say
they
have
assurance
for
i
told
him
that
they
might
very
well
do
that
but
that
if
he
gave
me
a
mailed
coat
with
plate
sleeves
and
also
kneecaps
of
steel
together
with
my
arms
and
cap
i
thought
i
could
make
a
race
for
it
and
carry
them
all
off
along
with
me
but
laddie
he
cried
ye
gang
to
your
death
i
told
him
not
so
for
that
even
when
accoutred
i
was
a
notable
runner
and
could
course
like
a
hare
and
in
any
case
better
launce
kennedy
be
dead
than
culzean
or
the
provost
and
yourself
sir
thomas
nisbett
what
would
happen
to
the
town
and
countryside
then
ay
better
that
he
said
very
sententiously
at
which
i
could
scarce
forbear
but
smile
for
the
very
simplicity
of
the
man
was
such
that
he
not
only
counted
his
life
worth
more
than
mine
but
expected
me
to
do
the
same
however
it
was
not
concerning
him
but
of
my
master
and
my
master
s
children
that
i
thought
what
mattered
little
to
a
kennedy
of
kirrieoch
mattered
greatly
to
sir
thomas
kennedy
tutor
of
culzean
yet
i
know
not
that
i
had
any
great
fear
of
failure
for
i
had
thus
far
won
off
even
when
in
the
general
engagement
our
faction
had
gotten
the
worst
of
it
and
so
i
thought
to
do
always
the
evening
wore
on
like
eternity
and
i
had
many
a
thought
in
my
heart
though
but
few
of
them
were
sad
or
waesooie
for
i
was
too
young
most
of
all
i
prayed
that
i
might
bear
myself
well
and
in
some
shape
at
least
carry
the
matter
through
without
dishonour
when
the
provost
and
my
master
had
well
drunken
and
eaten
yet
more
their
host
stole
away
from
them
on
a
pretext
and
came
to
the
chamber
where
i
sat
in
darkness
planning
how
to
make
my
way
through
the
garden
he
brought
me
presently
the
equipment
of
which
i
had
need
and
of
his
own
accord
added
another
pistol
of
admirable
french
workmanship
for
france
is
ever
the
country
for
good
ordnance
of
all
the
pistolet
which
sir
thomas
nisbett
gave
me
to
the
cannons
that
dang
down
the
castle
of
saint
andrews
about
the
heads
of
normand
leslie
and
his
crew
gin
ye
live
ye
kin
keep
the
pistol
he
said
as
one
that
did
me
a
vast
kindness
then
over
my
steel
cap
i
set
the
great
broad
hat
of
sir
thomas
of
culzean
and
did
his
cloak
about
me
it
was
now
the
time
to
go
and
i
tell
you
true
my
heart
beat
a
pretty
tune
to
dance
to
as
i
stood
at
the
back
of
the
my
host
hiding
well
in
the
rear
lest
they
should
nick
him
by
firing
as
the
light
within
showed
me
plain
in
the
doorway
so
i
ordered
the
lamp
to
be
removed
and
the
door
to
be
opened
then
my
host
bade
me
adieu
in
a
loud
hearty
tone
and
said
that
he
would
come
round
and
visit
me
in
the
morning
it
was
with
a
bitter
sort
of
joy
not
wholly
unpleasant
that
i
heard
the
door
clash
sharply
to
behind
me
i
had
my
sword
in
my
right
hand
and
my
pistol
ready
bent
in
the
other
and
i
bethought
me
how
many
would
have
risked
the
same
wager
of
battle
there
was
a
light
flickering
somewhere
in
the
a
party
passing
homeward
with
torches
from
a
merry
making
or
some
of
the
bonfires
lighted
for
the
inbringing
of
the
new
year
i
could
see
my
friend
of
the
beckoning
hand
now
standing
erect
with
his
plaid
about
him
he
was
the
same
i
had
seen
at
the
burning
of
the
bible
when
i
was
but
a
boy
in
the
courtyard
of
ardstinchar
and
i
doubted
not
the
grey
man
of
our
later
troubles
i
knew
that
the
sharpshooters
would
be
placed
in
the
alleys
of
the
garden
indeed
i
had
seen
them
pass
to
their
situations
and
observed
that
they
had
their
hackbutts
carefully
pointed
at
the
path
along
which
i
must
pass
so
instead
of
walking
directly
down
the
main
road
to
the
gate
i
made
believe
to
stumble
on
the
threshold
and
to
recover
myself
with
an
exclamation
of
pain
in
order
that
i
might
divert
them
into
waiting
till
i
should
come
their
way
for
i
must
perforce
pass
by
the
mouths
of
their
muskets
so
close
that
they
could
not
miss
but
instead
of
taking
the
main
avenue
i
darted
sideways
along
the
narrower
path
which
led
round
the
garden
s
edge
and
there
cowering
in
the
angle
i
waited
for
what
should
happen
in
their
hurry
and
surprise
i
heard
one
hackbutt
go
off
with
a
crash
and
the
light
from
the
touch
lit
up
the
garden
then
in
the
darkness
that
followed
i
ran
further
down
the
walk
towards
the
outer
gate
in
the
midst
i
came
upon
a
fellow
who
kneeled
with
his
musket
upon
a
stick
trained
upon
the
middle
path
by
which
they
had
hoped
that
culzean
would
come
then
with
my
sword
i
stuck
the
hulking
villain
through
that
part
of
him
with
which
i
came
most
readily
in
contact
what
that
might
be
i
declare
that
i
know
not
until
this
day
only
i
judged
that
it
could
not
have
been
a
very
mortal
one
by
the
vigour
with
which
he
cried
out
then
indeed
there
was
confusion
and
deray
to
speak
about
i
saw
the
form
of
the
grey
man
whom
i
had
observed
directing
the
ambush
rise
from
the
further
he
spoke
sharply
like
one
that
cries
orders
and
at
the
word
many
men
came
rushing
to
see
what
was
the
cause
of
the
hideous
outcry
on
that
side
of
the
garden
where
i
was
but
i
overstepped
the
carcase
of
the
rascal
into
whom
i
had
set
my
good
blade
and
most
circumspectly
made
my
way
down
the
side
of
the
wall
unseen
of
any
but
when
i
had
advanced
as
far
as
the
way
out
by
the
single
gate
my
fate
came
as
it
were
to
the
stern
and
deadly
breach
for
there
were
marksmen
who
had
their
pieces
trained
on
that
place
with
my
own
eyes
i
had
seen
them
set
themselves
in
position
nevertheless
the
noise
behind
waxed
so
imminent
that
i
drew
a
long
breath
and
sprang
at
the
opening
as
i
went
through
ten
or
twelve
pieces
at
the
least
both
pistolets
and
hackbutts
were
loosed
off
against
me
i
heard
the
bullets
splash
splash
all
about
my
legs
and
body
and
one
that
had
bounded
from
the
lintel
of
the
dunted
me
on
the
breastplate
which
it
was
a
god
s
mercy
i
had
minded
to
wear
yet
for
all
i
escaped
wholly
unscathed
outside
the
gate
there
were
two
fellows
that
withstood
me
and
i
had
small
time
to
ask
whether
they
were
friends
or
foes
so
to
make
siccar
i
speered
no
catechisms
of
them
but
only
shot
off
my
pistol
into
one
of
the
thickest
parts
of
one
setting
the
muzzle
almost
to
his
belt
and
with
yet
more
gladness
gave
the
other
a
sound
iron
thrust
in
the
shoulder
for
all
my
life
i
have
loved
the
point
more
than
the
a
thousand
times
better
than
the
powder
and
is
an
uncertain
thing
at
best
i
cleared
the
yett
sprang
through
and
there
i
had
it
down
the
high
street
of
maybole
with
the
bullets
spelking
about
me
like
hailstones
and
chance
burghers
scudding
for
their
doors
like
conies
on
the
sandy
knowes
i
heard
the
fierce
rush
of
men
behind
me
and
looking
over
my
shoulder
i
saw
some
ten
running
my
way
with
their
swords
drawn
in
their
hands
so
i
knew
that
it
was
likely
there
would
be
one
among
them
who
could
outrun
me
having
upon
me
and
that
not
all
mine
own
with
that
i
undid
the
cloak
of
the
laird
of
culzean
my
master
and
let
it
fall
and
so
much
lightened
i
sped
on
till
near
to
the
house
of
one
matthew
m
gowan
they
fairly
ran
me
to
earth
midnight
the
place
of
my
refuge
was
a
set
in
a
garden
and
mostly
made
of
wood
but
it
had
three
feet
of
stonework
about
the
walls
which
chance
fortifications
as
i
think
saved
my
life
then
i
praised
the
forethought
with
which
i
had
brought
with
me
abundant
powder
and
shot
in
the
horns
i
had
slung
at
my
girdle
i
also
remembered
to
thank
providence
for
misdirecting
the
bullets
as
i
ran
out
of
the
garden
door
here
in
this
small
child
s
playhouse
it
was
my
fortune
to
stand
such
a
siege
as
mayhap
never
man
stood
before
and
of
that
i
shall
tell
so
that
all
may
judge
and
see
whether
the
reward
which
the
earl
of
cassillis
afterwards
obtained
for
me
was
at
all
out
of
keeping
as
some
allege
with
the
services
which
i
launce
kennedy
sometime
esquire
rendered
to
him
and
his
house
yet
i
did
the
thing
for
love
and
by
no
means
for
reward
ay
and
largely
without
thought
also
for
such
was
the
spirit
of
the
times
that
wagers
of
battle
were
accepted
lightly
to
spite
one
and
overpass
another
like
children
that
play
upon
the
street
so
i
lay
in
my
behind
the
low
breastwork
of
stone
while
above
me
the
bullets
rattled
through
the
frail
woodwork
like
hailstones
that
splash
into
still
water
lying
thus
prone
i
charged
my
thing
which
from
long
practice
i
could
do
very
well
in
the
dark
and
gazed
out
through
the
open
windows
that
looked
every
way
what
i
suffered
from
most
was
the
want
of
light
upon
the
approaches
of
my
castle
at
the
top
of
the
garden
for
i
was
placed
upon
a
little
hill
and
the
ground
sloped
in
every
direction
from
me
yet
even
this
advantage
of
position
did
me
little
good
for
the
light
was
too
uncertain
to
show
me
those
that
might
come
against
me
and
more
than
all
this
uncertainty
put
me
in
a
sweat
lest
i
should
shoot
at
shadows
and
allow
the
real
enemy
that
came
to
invade
and
slay
me
to
pass
harmless
so
that
they
would
break
upon
me
before
i
was
aware
occasionally
however
the
light
that
burned
somewhere
in
the
town
cast
glimmerings
over
the
garden
and
then
i
could
see
dark
figures
that
crouched
and
scudded
behind
bushes
and
sheltered
ayont
the
trunk
of
every
leafless
tree
after
that
illumination
grew
brighter
i
think
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
each
time
i
got
a
fair
chance
at
an
enemy
there
was
one
rascal
the
fewer
at
least
one
that
had
a
shot
the
more
in
him
it
cheered
me
to
see
them
crawling
out
of
the
range
of
my
ordnances
as
if
they
had
been
few
and
i
a
host
most
of
all
i
aimed
with
the
deadliest
and
most
prayerful
intent
to
kill
at
the
tall
man
in
the
cloak
whom
i
had
seen
from
the
first
directing
the
ploy
time
and
again
i
believed
that
i
had
him
but
upon
each
occasion
it
was
some
meaner
rogue
that
bore
the
brunt
thus
i
held
my
own
with
sir
thomas
s
french
pistol
laid
aside
ready
for
them
if
they
came
with
a
rush
and
my
own
for
common
use
to
load
and
fire
again
withal
till
the
barrels
almost
scorched
me
with
the
heat
also
i
kept
my
sword
ready
to
my
hand
for
when
it
comes
to
the
edge
of
death
i
put
more
confidence
in
my
blade
than
in
all
the
ordnance
in
the
land
though
heaven
forbid
that
i
should
speak
against
the
pistolet
when
that
very
night
i
had
so
often
owed
my
life
to
it
my
chief
hope
now
was
that
the
provost
of
the
place
who
had
been
a
guest
with
sir
thomas
might
escape
and
rouse
the
townsfolk
the
people
of
maybole
loved
not
the
barganies
greatly
but
on
the
contrary
were
devoted
to
the
service
of
my
master
culzean
because
of
his
kindliness
of
disposition
and
the
heartsome
way
he
had
of
calling
them
all
sandy
and
jeems
according
to
their
christian
name
a
thing
which
goes
a
far
road
in
scotland
it
so
happened
just
then
that
the
fire
that
did
me
so
much
as
i
afterwards
learned
was
lighted
by
one
of
my
enemies
for
frolic
in
the
of
one
duncan
crerar
up
a
little
and
cast
a
skarrow
over
the
garden
where
i
was
when
it
was
at
its
brightest
there
came
four
fellows
running
up
the
brae
all
with
their
swords
bare
in
their
hands
so
that
it
seemed
that
i
was
as
good
as
dead
for
it
was
manifestly
impossible
that
i
could
withstand
them
all
but
i
minded
the
saying
of
a
great
captain
of
the
old
wars
stop
you
the
front
rank
and
the
second
will
stop
of
so
i
took
good
and
careful
aim
with
my
pistols
at
the
two
fellows
that
led
the
charge
and
fired
the
first
of
them
tossed
his
blade
in
the
air
spun
about
like
a
weathercock
and
fell
headlong
while
the
other
lamed
in
his
leg
as
it
appeared
tried
to
crawl
back
down
the
hill
again
the
two
that
came
behind
were
no
little
daunted
by
this
fall
nevertheless
they
still
came
on
but
i
cried
out
as
loud
as
i
could
give
me
the
other
pistols
sir
thomas
and
i
shall
do
for
these
two
scoundrels
also
at
which
they
gave
back
in
great
astonishment
and
ran
i
make
no
doubt
to
tell
their
masters
that
they
had
to
do
with
more
than
one
old
man
well
lined
with
sack
and
canary
then
in
the
breathing
space
i
charged
my
pistols
again
and
cried
to
the
fellow
that
was
limping
along
the
ground
by
the
back
of
my
link
it
my
lad
back
to
your
master
or
i
shall
put
another
bullet
in
ye
in
a
place
where
it
will
stop
you
from
groaning
and
hirpling
there
at
my
lug
for
i
understood
well
that
he
desired
to
take
me
in
the
rear
at
this
moment
there
happened
a
thing
surprising
i
saw
a
tall
dark
figure
overleap
a
wall
at
the
side
from
which
the
shots
came
thinnest
i
saw
it
stoop
and
lay
fire
to
something
that
was
darker
than
itself
when
instantly
there
arose
from
the
pile
of
millwright
s
shavings
and
kindling
wood
a
clear
light
which
caused
all
the
garden
to
be
seen
without
any
difficulty
then
the
tall
unknown
figure
which
seemed
yet
unaccountably
familiar
to
me
walked
slowly
up
the
middle
walk
toward
the
the
pistols
cracking
all
about
and
the
bullets
splashing
faster
than
ever
upon
the
roof
and
sides
of
my
shelter
then
i
saw
who
it
was
run
for
it
robert
harburgh
i
cried
man
you
are
but
i
declare
he
never
altered
by
a
single
his
deliberate
advance
at
the
door
he
paused
as
one
that
upon
the
threshold
would
turn
to
kick
a
yelping
cur
then
giving
the
sharpshooters
a
wave
of
his
hand
in
contempt
he
entered
and
shut
the
door
saint
kentigern
s
fish
and
a
thousand
devils
said
i
i
am
not
feared
of
any
man
but
there
is
no
sense
in
foolhardiness
robert
come
in
out
of
reach
of
their
bullets
this
moment
thou
fool
ah
he
returned
to
me
i
had
as
lief
die
and
be
done
with
but
then
i
would
not
for
my
stomach
is
in
good
order
replied
i
swiftly
so
lie
down
on
thy
belly
and
at
the
least
help
me
to
keep
alive
for
i
am
most
consumedly
anxious
to
keep
my
body
from
proving
leaky
by
the
entering
in
of
so
obediently
he
laid
him
down
watching
one
side
of
our
cunning
defences
he
told
me
that
he
had
heard
what
was
that
the
mures
and
drummurchies
together
with
sawny
bean
the
savage
carl
that
was
called
of
the
common
people
the
earl
of
hell
had
gotten
the
laird
of
culzean
in
a
little
in
a
walled
garden
and
were
there
worrying
him
to
death
so
said
harburgh
having
nought
better
to
do
i
primed
my
pistols
and
the
firing
upon
us
grew
hotter
than
ever
we
seemed
at
times
to
be
closed
within
a
ring
of
fire
yet
neither
of
us
were
the
least
hurt
save
that
a
chip
from
the
edge
of
a
stone
driven
off
by
a
bullet
had
struck
me
on
the
cheek
and
made
it
bleed
when
the
fire
which
robert
harburgh
had
lighted
burned
up
we
that
were
marksmen
lost
no
chances
at
any
who
showed
so
much
as
an
arm
or
a
leg
and
many
of
those
murderous
rascals
whom
we
did
not
kill
outright
not
having
a
fair
chance
at
them
from
their
lying
in
shelter
and
other
causes
were
at
least
winged
and
sore
damaged
so
that
we
judged
that
there
would
be
some
roods
of
lint
bandage
required
about
drummurchie
and
auchendrayne
on
the
morrow
outside
we
heard
a
great
and
growing
turmoil
and
the
sound
of
many
voices
crying
to
the
death
with
the
murderers
break
down
the
doors
it
was
the
noise
of
the
people
who
had
risen
in
the
night
and
were
coming
to
help
us
for
in
a
moment
the
gate
of
the
yard
was
broken
down
and
a
rout
of
men
in
steel
caps
and
armour
came
pouring
in
and
it
had
been
comical
to
watch
the
array
if
our
urgent
business
had
allowed
for
some
had
put
on
a
breastplate
over
their
night
gear
some
fought
like
highlandmen
in
their
which
on
the
night
of
the
new
year
must
have
been
breezy
wear
while
others
again
had
snatched
a
hackbutt
and
had
forgotten
the
powder
so
that
now
they
carried
the
weapon
like
a
club
by
the
barrel
before
these
angry
levies
our
cruel
invaders
vanished
like
smoke
as
though
they
had
never
been
clambering
over
walls
and
scurrying
through
entries
but
it
is
reported
that
several
of
them
were
sore
hurt
in
thus
here
and
there
throughout
the
town
were
no
fewer
than
five
dead
and
six
wounded
chiefly
in
the
two
gardens
where
i
had
been
compelled
to
discharge
my
pistols
robert
harburgh
stepped
out
of
the
before
them
all
stretching
his
limbs
tis
a
cramped
ungodly
place
friends
he
said
after
all
it
is
better
to
fight
in
the
open
and
risk
it
where
is
the
laird
of
culzean
cried
some
that
knew
him
not
if
ye
can
not
show
us
the
laird
ye
shall
die
forthwith
nay
replied
harburgh
concerning
that
i
ken
not
tis
not
in
my
province
being
general
information
my
parish
is
fighting
not
the
answering
of
questions
come
hither
launce
and
tell
them
of
thy
master
whereat
i
came
forth
and
told
them
of
the
cruel
plot
and
the
attack
upon
sir
thomas
at
nisbett
s
house
but
they
would
not
be
satisfied
till
they
had
gone
there
and
found
him
nothing
would
do
but
that
he
should
show
himself
unhurt
and
speak
a
word
to
them
at
the
window
which
being
of
temper
and
with
a
monstrous
headache
he
was
most
loath
to
do
but
robert
harburgh
who
had
experience
of
suchlike
being
before
his
marriage
a
great
man
of
his
cups
poured
water
upon
his
head
and
having
dried
it
by
rubbing
he
brought
him
to
the
window
where
he
spoke
to
the
people
as
his
kindly
friends
and
neighbours
and
thanked
them
for
their
affection
nay
cried
one
thank
your
own
young
squire
who
has
ta
en
your
life
upon
so
the
people
of
maybole
for
the
honest
and
honourable
love
which
they
bore
us
abode
under
arms
till
the
morning
and
searched
all
the
town
for
the
murdering
ruffians
of
drummurchie
yet
they
found
them
not
for
such
always
have
a
back
door
to
escape
by
in
the
morning
sir
thomas
called
for
his
hat
and
cloak
and
when
they
were
brought
he
started
in
wonder
and
cried
what
in
the
name
of
the
shrunk
shanks
of
the
abbot
of
crossraguel
is
the
meaning
of
this
hole
then
robert
harburgh
said
tis
but
an
airy
summer
suit
that
launcelot
wore
last
night
when
he
went
forth
among
those
that
sought
to
kill
the
laird
of
my
master
stared
without
comprehending
but
when
he
fully
understood
he
clasped
me
in
his
arms
god
knows
he
said
i
would
give
my
right
hand
if
i
could
believe
that
i
had
a
son
who
would
ever
do
as
much
for
me
those
i
have
are
good
for
naught
but
golf
and
wherein
by
his
hasty
words
he
did
his
honest
silly
lads
much
wrong
and
dimple
one
sabbath
morn
there
came
an
unwonted
message
to
me
as
i
sat
lingering
and
idle
in
the
armoury
of
culzean
i
had
cleaned
my
own
graith
and
oiled
the
i
regularly
did
on
the
sabbath
morning
whenever
i
did
not
go
to
the
kirk
at
maybole
now
this
particular
day
of
which
i
speak
i
was
idly
conning
the
leaves
of
a
full
of
trifling
vain
and
amatorious
lilts
and
of
them
very
pleasant
however
and
taking
to
the
mind
it
ought
to
have
been
my
that
i
was
at
god
forgive
me
but
since
it
was
why
even
so
will
i
set
it
down
here
and
the
message
that
came
was
by
the
mouth
of
a
kind
of
jackal
or
lickpot
of
john
dick
for
reasons
of
his
own
hated
me
chiefly
because
i
took
no
share
in
the
foulness
of
him
and
his
subservient
crew
this
youth
was
of
so
little
worth
that
in
all
the
transactions
of
this
book
he
has
not
once
come
into
the
as
i
now
remember
he
was
at
the
tulzie
in
edinburgh
and
also
at
the
flitting
of
the
sow
on
both
occasions
he
was
the
first
to
run
the
name
of
him
was
colin
millar
an
envious
upsetting
knave
compact
of
various
ignorances
and
incapacities
and
there
needs
no
more
to
be
said
about
him
there
is
a
man
wanting
to
see
you
down
at
sandy
allison
s
the
grieve
s
he
said
then
he
looked
at
me
with
the
cast
in
his
eye
as
crooked
as
a
paddock
s
hind
leg
and
says
he
the
tat
will
be
in
the
fire
now
i
m
thinking
they
tell
me
that
it
is
the
minister
i
knew
very
well
what
the
hound
meant
so
right
gladly
without
a
word
i
set
the
knuckles
of
my
hand
sabbath
morning
though
it
was
against
his
ugly
face
in
a
way
that
would
leave
a
mark
for
a
day
or
two
take
you
that
dog
i
said
to
him
and
learn
to
keep
a
more
ruly
member
in
your
insolent
head
think
not
that
you
are
john
dick
though
you
carry
his
dirty
slanders
as
the
wild
boar
gnashes
its
tushes
so
the
little
piglings
squeak
and
as
he
went
away
lowering
and
snarling
i
had
a
mind
to
go
after
him
and
give
him
something
more
than
my
knuckles
for
the
thing
he
meant
was
a
lie
of
the
devil
lighted
at
his
furnace
and
spewed
out
of
the
reek
of
his
pit
but
as
i
went
to
the
door
there
came
a
poor
lad
from
the
stable
with
the
same
there
waited
one
for
me
at
the
house
of
sandy
allison
the
grieve
so
i
knew
that
the
dog
millar
had
not
invented
the
whole
matter
whereupon
i
looked
carefully
to
my
gear
did
a
new
doublet
upon
me
because
it
was
the
sabbath
day
and
girt
me
with
a
sash
of
blue
coft
in
edinburgh
and
never
before
worn
then
setting
my
sword
in
its
sheath
i
went
out
through
the
woods
which
were
now
grown
leafless
and
songless
there
was
a
brisk
air
of
winter
crisp
without
rawness
in
the
breeze
and
i
was
glad
to
be
out
of
doors
for
since
the
matter
of
the
meeting
with
gilbert
kennedy
which
by
ill
chance
i
had
seen
both
marjorie
and
nell
came
seldom
my
way
which
is
perhaps
why
i
looked
so
well
to
my
apparelling
ere
i
went
to
the
grieve
s
house
for
a
lad
wearies
for
the
speech
of
and
if
he
gets
not
one
he
will
seek
another
but
now
when
i
come
to
think
of
it
i
need
not
have
troubled
so
to
deck
myself
for
after
the
corner
is
turned
and
the
long
lane
leads
straight
to
the
garden
of
roses
a
woman
cares
not
whether
a
man
be
clothed
in
dishclouts
or
whether
he
glitters
like
a
bridegroom
in
cloth
of
gold
so
when
i
came
near
to
the
house
there
issued
forth
to
meet
me
kate
allison
which
seemed
to
me
like
ancient
days
come
back
and
my
heart
beat
in
a
fashion
i
never
thought
to
feel
again
for
a
burnt
stick
is
easily
lighted
and
kate
allison
was
without
doubt
both
bonny
and
kind
she
was
waiting
for
me
at
the
corner
of
the
barn
like
one
that
has
an
assignation
so
when
she
came
near
me
she
put
her
hands
roguishly
behind
her
and
said
launce
kennedy
you
are
a
false
deceitful
lad
and
no
true
lover
but
think
ye
not
that
i
care
a
pin
for
i
have
gotten
a
braw
lad
of
my
own
and
no
thanks
to
you
ye
can
get
the
lady
marjorie
to
convoy
hame
next
year
from
the
maybole
and
her
speech
made
me
glad
for
she
dropped
me
a
courtesy
and
pretended
to
march
off
so
i
knew
full
well
that
if
she
had
not
been
and
at
ease
about
all
doubtful
matters
she
would
have
greeted
me
very
differently
so
as
i
say
i
was
glad
yet
presently
i
liked
it
not
so
well
as
i
expected
for
though
men
are
often
false
to
their
loves
they
never
understand
how
their
loves
can
change
from
loving
them
i
knew
well
that
kate
would
if
not
meddled
with
immediately
return
to
tell
me
what
had
befallen
and
why
it
was
that
they
had
sent
for
me
which
indeed
was
just
what
she
did
we
have
gotten
a
mighty
grave
man
here
with
us
who
came
to
our
house
last
night
at
e
en
we
wanted
to
send
word
to
the
castle
to
sir
thomas
but
the
man
said
that
he
had
had
enough
of
the
kennedies
to
last
him
his
lifetime
and
that
he
would
put
up
with
us
if
we
could
make
shift
to
give
him
a
bed
he
is
a
man
of
a
majestic
and
noble
countenance
and
when
he
had
come
within
he
took
a
bible
from
his
wallet
and
tairged
us
tightly
on
the
histories
of
the
wars
of
the
jews
and
on
points
of
ye
would
be
fit
for
that
said
i
to
her
laughing
for
most
of
our
discourse
has
been
upon
points
of
doctrine
and
i
mind
not
that
we
touched
upon
the
wars
of
the
jews
we
had
ever
wars
enough
of
our
own
was
it
not
so
sweet
kate
and
i
would
have
taken
her
by
the
waist
for
that
is
ever
the
way
as
i
have
just
been
reading
in
my
to
punish
a
woman
when
like
a
pretty
scold
she
slanders
her
love
so
as
the
london
stage
catch
hath
it
i
forgave
her
for
it
yet
for
all
she
would
by
no
means
permit
me
to
come
near
i
was
mortally
sorry
for
because
though
i
wanted
her
to
change
i
desired
her
not
to
change
so
mightily
as
all
that
na
na
she
said
and
that
s
by
with
kate
allison
needs
no
general
lovers
wear
you
your
own
lady
s
favours
i
can
get
them
that
loe
me
and
none
other
to
wear
i
pursued
the
subject
no
further
at
that
time
meaning
however
to
return
to
it
for
a
man
likes
not
to
see
the
things
which
have
been
freely
his
slipping
from
him
like
corn
through
a
riddle
it
makes
his
mind
linger
after
things
long
past
and
he
begins
to
think
them
sweeter
than
any
favours
that
ever
he
had
even
when
all
the
garden
was
most
fully
his
to
wander
in
and
cull
at
his
lordly
pleasure
too
soon
for
my
liking
therefore
we
came
to
the
door
of
the
grieve
s
house
which
was
but
a
wide
kitchen
with
two
smaller
rooms
off
it
i
heard
a
voice
uplifted
as
it
seemed
in
prayer
and
i
bethought
me
with
shame
of
my
so
late
mean
and
earthly
thoughts
but
i
looked
at
kate
allison
and
she
was
so
pleasant
to
look
upon
that
i
found
excuses
for
myself
then
the
prayer
being
done
we
went
in
and
they
told
the
man
in
the
inner
room
that
that
same
launcelot
kennedy
for
whom
he
had
inquired
was
come
so
in
a
moment
there
came
forth
from
the
inner
chamber
even
as
i
had
expected
maister
robert
bruce
he
wore
his
long
black
cloak
and
his
fine
cloth
coat
showed
soberly
beneath
it
his
hat
was
on
his
head
which
he
doffed
for
a
moment
to
kate
allison
and
her
mother
and
then
set
on
again
he
bade
them
excuse
him
for
that
he
had
much
business
to
talk
with
me
i
followed
him
out
and
as
i
passed
kate
methought
she
looked
disappointed
that
i
should
go
thus
soon
so
the
corners
of
her
mouth
being
down
and
her
mother
s
back
turned
i
put
my
hand
beneath
her
chin
and
plucked
at
the
loose
of
her
bonnet
which
was
a
pretty
quipsome
thing
that
haymakers
use
but
prettier
on
her
than
on
any
of
them
whereat
she
flashed
forth
a
great
sharp
pin
and
set
it
spitefully
in
my
arm
which
also
was
a
pleasing
habit
of
hers
but
all
was
innocent
and
friendly
enough
and
my
only
excuse
for
thinking
more
of
daffing
with
kate
allison
than
of
listening
to
the
grave
converse
of
maister
robert
bruce
is
that
then
i
was
nearing
nineteen
years
of
my
as
you
all
do
know
is
a
time
when
maids
dimples
are
more
moving
than
the
wisdom
of
the
sages
that
is
all
mine
excuse
and
as
well
i
wot
but
a
poor
one
yet
when
once
maister
bruce
had
me
in
the
wood
taking
me
by
the
arm
the
majesty
of
his
countenance
and
the
moving
fervour
of
his
voice
so
worked
upon
me
that
in
good
sooth
i
thought
of
naught
but
what
he
said
he
told
me
that
he
was
resolved
to
depart
out
of
this
land
of
carrick
and
kyle
which
might
have
been
the
garden
of
eden
if
it
were
not
inhabited
by
devils
he
had
come
no
speed
at
reconciling
the
parties
at
feud
even
as
i
could
have
told
him
before
he
began
when
i
had
thought
he
said
that
i
had
made
some
way
in
softening
the
heart
of
gilbert
kennedy
who
vaunts
himself
to
be
sincerely
attached
to
i
do
believe
said
to
him
that
he
ought
for
the
settling
of
the
quarrel
to
give
in
his
submission
to
his
liege
lord
the
earl
of
cassillis
in
a
moment
comes
the
fire
into
his
eyes
the
anger
grows
black
in
his
heart
and
all
my
good
words
are
undone
i
think
you
kennedies
are
all
of
you
possessed
with
evil
spirits
even
as
it
was
in
the
days
of
the
gadarene
out
of
whom
christ
cast
many
he
paused
a
moment
and
then
continued
so
the
name
of
the
devils
of
carrick
is
legion
for
they
are
very
many
then
being
sorry
that
he
should
so
speak
of
those
who
after
all
were
my
master
s
kin
and
in
a
manner
my
all
the
world
knows
that
a
blood
feud
is
a
thing
acknowledged
in
the
bible
as
one
may
see
when
david
lay
on
his
asked
him
how
i
could
serve
him
in
order
that
i
might
stay
his
abuse
of
that
which
he
did
not
understand
you
may
wonder
he
went
on
that
i
choose
to
speak
in
confidence
to
one
that
is
but
an
esquire
and
i
hear
as
ready
with
his
sword
in
the
quarrel
as
any
of
them
but
at
least
you
are
not
like
the
rest
occupied
entirely
with
the
safety
of
your
own
skin
and
unwilling
to
look
the
matter
in
the
face
i
told
him
that
i
did
not
wonder
at
all
that
he
was
willing
to
speak
to
me
for
that
i
could
keep
my
counsel
truly
and
well
faith
and
i
believe
that
he
cried
if
it
were
only
your
of
being
able
to
do
but
i
understood
not
at
all
what
he
meant
for
if
there
is
anything
that
i
am
conspicuously
lacking
in
it
is
this
very
quality
of
hear
ye
then
and
mark
well
my
words
said
the
minister
of
edinburgh
there
is
a
man
in
this
country
who
is
at
the
root
of
all
the
blood
and
all
the
slaughter
and
who
if
he
be
not
curbed
will
yet
do
tenfold
more
mischief
your
master
thinks
that
he
can
bribe
him
to
friendship
well
i
am
no
judge
of
men
if
the
man
is
to
be
bribed
at
any
price
beneath
the
sole
power
and
sway
of
all
this
wild
country
of
the
it
is
gilbert
kennedy
of
bargany
that
you
mean
said
i
for
i
own
i
was
jealous
of
his
good
name
enemy
though
he
was
gilbert
kennedy
is
but
a
hammer
in
this
man
s
hand
your
good
knight
here
at
culzean
is
but
a
spoon
for
him
to
sup
with
and
the
only
man
that
sees
through
him
and
that
but
partially
is
your
earl
whose
keen
care
for
the
merks
the
duties
and
the
tacks
makes
him
somewhat
clearer
in
the
eye
than
the
rest
of
and
who
is
this
plotter
said
i
he
stopped
and
looked
about
him
to
see
that
none
was
listening
then
he
laid
his
lips
almost
to
my
ear
he
whispered
a
name
which
in
this
place
i
must
not
write
though
afterwards
it
will
be
plain
enough
it
is
simply
not
possible
said
i
the
man
you
mention
is
but
a
bonnet
laird
as
one
might
say
with
a
and
a
holding
of
crofts
why
my
master
could
eat
him
up
saltless
without
turning
out
more
than
half
a
parish
of
his
fighting
nevertheless
said
robert
bruce
that
is
the
man
who
stands
behind
and
makes
the
miracles
work
as
in
popish
days
the
priests
were
wont
to
do
behind
the
altar
ye
are
but
a
set
of
jigging
fools
here
in
carrick
and
the
man
that
pipes
to
you
is
the
man
i
ve
told
ye
of
then
i
thought
over
the
that
i
knew
of
the
man
in
truth
said
i
i
am
none
so
sure
that
you
may
not
be
robert
bruce
smiled
as
one
that
waxes
aweary
of
a
babe
s
prattle
for
said
i
i
mind
that
i
heard
him
endeavour
to
win
one
by
promises
to
the
side
of
pshaw
said
the
minister
he
would
as
readily
try
to
win
bargany
to
the
earl
s
side
if
it
suited
him
to
murder
them
both
together
it
is
his
plan
to
make
them
fight
each
other
till
there
are
none
cut
off
the
heads
of
the
taller
poppies
as
in
the
ancient
tale
of
rome
i
tell
you
this
man
has
no
side
but
his
own
no
desire
but
his
own
profit
no
end
but
to
make
himself
supreme
in
and
what
can
i
that
am
but
a
squire
and
a
youth
do
in
the
matter
said
i
you
are
on
the
spot
launcelot
said
the
minister
kindly
i
am
in
edinburgh
and
if
things
march
as
evilly
as
they
have
been
doing
of
late
it
is
likely
i
shall
be
even
further
afield
than
edinburgh
but
you
can
can
judge
whom
it
boots
to
warn
you
can
put
in
a
i
shall
put
in
a
sword
said
i
stamping
my
foot
put
it
in
think
of
such
deceit
and
guile
in
a
mere
vassal
and
understrapper
of
my
lord
launcelot
said
the
minister
of
edinburgh
you
begin
to
make
me
sorry
i
trusted
you
i
should
have
spoken
to
a
graver
nay
sir
i
said
you
mistake
me
i
but
mean
that
if
it
came
to
the
bitter
bite
of
iron
the
time
for
words
might
go
ay
he
replied
thoughtfully
there
is
some
sense
in
that
but
give
not
up
the
judicious
words
too
so
we
betook
ourselves
gravely
and
staidly
out
of
the
wood
and
at
bidding
him
farewell
i
received
his
benediction
which
he
gave
me
with
his
right
hand
stretched
out
and
though
i
am
tall
and
stand
as
erect
as
any
man
yet
the
minister
of
edinburgh
overtowered
me
by
half
a
foot
but
i
minded
that
not
in
him
so
i
went
to
the
castle
armoury
to
bethink
me
for
after
what
i
had
heard
maids
and
bonnet
strings
were
not
to
be
more
in
my
thought
that
day
corbies
at
the
eagle
s
one
snowy
day
i
mind
it
was
a
thursday
according
to
the
day
of
the
week
i
had
ridden
to
girvan
by
the
shore
road
i
journeyed
unmolested
save
that
one
sent
a
shot
after
me
as
i
passed
the
tower
of
girvanmains
but
this
not
so
much
i
think
with
intent
to
do
me
an
injury
as
because
they
saw
my
cassillis
colours
and
could
not
let
them
pass
unchallenged
by
a
yett
of
the
bargany
folk
but
upon
my
return
i
got
one
of
the
greatest
surprises
of
my
life
for
as
i
rode
gladly
into
the
courtyard
of
culzean
lo
there
was
my
lord
out
on
the
steps
with
the
noble
courtesy
and
distinction
which
none
could
assume
so
well
as
he
being
indeed
natural
to
him
bidding
farewell
to
a
pair
of
guests
whom
i
never
looked
to
see
in
the
courtyard
of
culzean
save
as
it
might
be
coming
in
decently
heels
first
for
the
purposes
of
christian
burial
the
two
strangers
were
john
mure
of
auchendrayne
and
the
young
laird
his
son
the
old
man
was
dressed
as
i
first
saw
plain
fine
cloth
of
blue
without
decoration
he
wore
no
arms
or
any
armour
that
was
by
the
square
setting
of
his
body
as
he
came
down
the
steps
i
judged
that
he
wore
a
stand
of
chain
mail
underneath
his
son
james
a
cruel
loutish
but
not
wholly
young
man
was
clad
in
the
gayest
fashion
he
wore
the
wide
falling
lace
collar
which
prince
henry
had
brought
in
from
france
and
a
pointed
doublet
and
wide
breeches
of
the
newest
english
mode
it
was
john
mure
who
was
speaking
for
his
son
was
but
a
lout
and
had
little
to
say
all
the
days
of
him
he
waved
his
hand
to
the
steps
by
the
door
of
culzean
whereon
there
stood
marjorie
kennedy
with
her
arm
on
nell
s
shoulder
both
being
pale
as
death
and
seeming
more
dowie
and
sad
than
i
had
ever
seen
them
look
before
it
is
to
be
the
burying
of
strife
cried
auchendrayne
in
this
loving
cup
i
drink
it
the
day
of
our
love
is
at
the
dawning
and
the
auguries
of
the
time
to
come
are
of
the
happiest
to
our
next
and
sweeter
merrymaking
and
sir
thomas
with
his
face
one
beaming
smile
of
pleasure
bade
him
a
loving
farewell
and
told
him
to
haste
back
for
that
cousins
thus
joined
in
affection
could
not
be
too
often
together
and
all
the
while
i
sat
dom
nicholas
as
one
that
is
sunk
fathoms
deep
in
blank
astonishment
as
auchendrayne
rode
through
the
gateway
he
waved
his
hand
to
me
and
turning
to
culzean
where
he
stood
looking
after
them
he
cried
in
the
hearing
of
them
all
you
have
there
the
handsomest
and
the
boldest
squire
in
all
the
south
country
culzean
this
is
the
bruit
that
i
hear
of
this
young
man
everywhere
i
and
so
still
smiling
and
bowing
he
rode
away
with
his
son
half
a
length
of
his
horse
behind
him
but
i
gave
him
no
greeting
neither
yea
nor
regarded
him
with
a
fixed
countenance
for
my
heart
was
like
stone
within
me
because
of
the
sorrow
that
i
saw
coming
on
the
house
and
could
noways
prevent
now
the
bitterness
of
this
winter
did
not
come
till
some
time
after
the
new
year
it
was
about
the
midst
of
january
when
the
frost
bit
most
keenly
and
the
snow
began
to
fall
most
deeply
the
culzean
lads
james
alexander
and
little
david
who
was
my
favourite
caused
the
court
and
to
ring
with
happiness
joy
and
peace
seemed
indeed
for
a
little
to
have
come
back
to
culzean
this
was
the
first
snow
since
david
had
donned
the
trunks
and
laid
by
the
bairn
s
are
indeed
mortally
cold
wear
in
the
winter
season
when
it
comes
to
rolling
in
the
snow
david
as
i
say
was
my
favourite
and
continually
in
my
loneliness
a
comfort
to
me
though
i
have
not
hitherto
often
mentioned
him
seeing
that
the
young
lads
of
culzean
come
not
into
my
tale
greatly
saving
at
this
time
though
in
the
coming
day
they
may
into
the
tales
others
shall
tell
when
we
that
now
prank
it
so
gaily
are
no
better
than
the
broken
shards
of
a
drained
but
little
davie
was
a
merry
lad
and
i
am
glad
that
there
is
occasion
for
me
to
name
him
in
this
history
davie
was
now
manfully
equipped
in
doublet
and
trunk
hosen
of
duffle
grey
homespun
so
thick
that
his
brothers
feigned
that
with
a
little
trouble
and
propping
they
stood
up
very
well
by
themselves
when
their
daily
tenant
had
untrussed
him
and
gone
to
bed
and
ever
the
snow
came
down
it
lay
deep
on
all
the
face
of
the
country
but
more
especially
it
had
swirled
into
the
courtyard
of
culzean
so
that
the
very
steps
of
the
door
were
sleeked
and
great
wreaths
lay
every
way
about
the
court
the
lads
made
revel
in
it
borrowing
shovels
from
the
stables
and
throwing
up
the
snow
on
either
side
so
as
to
make
narrow
passages
between
the
different
doors
of
the
castle
and
the
offices
about
i
can
not
set
down
because
that
there
is
press
of
matters
more
serious
yet
to
be
related
a
tithe
of
the
merry
pranks
the
rogues
wrought
in
their
madness
they
revelled
in
the
smother
of
the
snow
like
whelps
that
are
turned
loose
yet
because
there
is
none
too
much
of
merriment
in
this
chronicle
i
shall
make
shift
to
tell
somewhat
of
their
quipsome
rascaldom
it
chanced
one
morning
that
alexander
who
was
of
a
mirthful
mind
stood
by
a
little
door
which
led
into
the
house
wherein
our
peats
and
turfs
were
kept
for
the
fires
so
that
it
might
not
be
necessary
to
bring
a
supply
each
day
from
the
peatstacks
on
the
hill
where
the
greater
store
was
whether
sandy
s
head
ached
from
having
eaten
too
many
cakes
at
the
time
of
the
new
year
i
know
not
but
suddenly
it
came
into
his
mind
that
it
might
be
a
desirable
thing
and
a
cooling
to
stick
his
bullet
head
into
a
mighty
snowdrift
which
lay
in
front
of
the
door
so
accordingly
for
no
particular
reason
he
bent
himself
into
an
arch
and
thrust
his
head
into
the
snow
at
this
moment
came
his
elder
brother
james
kennedy
upon
the
scene
and
his
mood
was
also
merry
bless
the
rascal
quoth
he
whither
hath
his
tidy
lump
of
a
betaken
itself
to
so
without
loss
of
a
moment
the
rogue
made
him
a
large
ball
of
snow
well
compacted
and
caused
it
to
burst
upon
the
stretched
trusses
of
sandy
s
breeches
with
a
noise
like
the
breaking
of
an
egg
upon
a
wall
sandy
snatched
his
head
from
the
snow
swift
as
a
blade
that
bends
itself
to
the
straight
and
stood
erect
there
was
no
one
in
sight
save
little
davie
who
danced
at
a
distance
and
laughed
innocently
at
the
jest
for
james
the
doer
of
it
had
instantly
dropped
into
a
deep
snow
passage
whereat
sandy
cured
as
to
his
head
but
villainously
stung
in
the
breech
turned
him
about
in
fierce
anger
seeking
for
someone
to
truncheon
the
lad
davie
s
laugh
annoyed
him
and
sandy
being
an
adept
at
the
palm
play
sent
a
snowball
at
his
young
brother
which
took
him
smartly
upon
the
cheek
instantly
davie
poor
callant
set
up
a
cry
of
pain
which
brought
his
sister
nell
upon
the
scene
with
all
the
furies
in
the
tangle
of
her
hair
ye
muckle
calves
she
cried
addressing
both
her
unseen
brothers
whom
she
well
knew
to
be
lying
hidden
somewhere
among
the
snow
passages
of
the
courtyard
i
will
bring
launce
kennedy
to
you
with
a
knotty
stick
and
that
by
my
father
s
at
a
bairn
that
gate
and
garring
him
greet
ye
think
i
canna
see
ye
but
if
ye
dinna
come
oot
decently
i
will
come
and
bring
ye
ye
may
think
black
shame
o
yoursel
s
and
this
i
do
not
doubt
that
james
and
sandy
did
for
to
be
flyted
upon
by
a
lass
lying
prone
the
while
upon
one
s
stomach
in
a
snow
bank
does
not
make
for
so
both
the
lads
began
to
crawl
away
as
best
they
might
from
nell
s
dangerous
neighbourhood
it
jumped
greatly
with
my
humour
to
watch
them
from
the
upper
window
of
the
armoury
which
looked
abroad
over
the
court
all
unwitting
they
approached
the
one
to
the
other
with
their
heads
down
and
at
the
corner
each
running
with
full
speed
upon
his
hands
and
knees
they
knocked
their
skulls
together
soundly
with
a
crack
which
pleased
me
instantly
they
clinched
and
fought
like
wild
cats
biting
and
fisting
in
the
their
father
attracted
from
the
hall
by
the
noise
came
down
and
laid
upon
them
both
right
soundly
with
the
great
whip
wherewith
the
dogs
were
beaten
when
they
were
trained
for
hunting
all
this
was
excellent
sport
to
me
but
the
best
was
yet
to
come
in
a
little
thereafter
i
saw
nell
who
was
a
merry
lass
when
there
was
nothing
upon
her
mind
come
quietly
out
of
the
side
door
that
led
to
the
kitchen
places
with
david
in
her
hand
she
set
him
within
a
small
flanking
tower
which
in
old
days
had
been
for
arrows
then
she
locked
the
door
upon
him
taking
the
key
with
her
before
she
went
she
handed
the
boy
two
or
three
snowballs
made
from
the
wet
slushy
snow
where
the
sunshine
had
caused
some
drops
to
melt
off
the
roof
and
fall
from
the
eaves
thus
she
went
to
the
corner
i
watching
with
joy
the
while
from
the
window
of
the
armoury
jamie
sandy
she
cried
come
hither
lads
there
s
something
here
for
your
private
ear
at
first
the
boys
would
not
move
still
smarting
and
sulky
from
their
father
s
but
in
a
little
they
came
and
nell
enticed
them
with
the
repeated
promise
of
something
for
their
private
ear
the
artful
minx
till
she
had
them
exactly
opposite
the
little
window
where
david
was
posted
with
his
weapons
of
offence
suddenly
from
the
there
came
a
discharge
of
artillery
the
providence
that
helps
the
weak
put
pith
and
fusion
into
little
david
s
arm
as
though
it
had
been
the
smooth
stone
of
the
brook
that
sped
whizzing
to
the
brazen
front
of
goliath
the
first
moist
shot
of
david
s
ordnance
plumped
with
a
splash
into
the
ear
of
sandy
in
an
instant
i
lay
upon
the
floor
in
the
laughter
which
comes
only
from
beholding
silly
things
for
there
below
me
were
james
and
sandy
kennedy
each
dancing
upon
the
point
of
their
shoon
and
with
their
little
fingers
digging
in
their
several
ears
to
excavate
from
thence
the
slush
wherewith
little
david
had
taken
his
fitting
revenge
nor
was
the
occupation
made
easier
for
them
by
the
vexatious
commentaries
of
their
sister
nell
who
repeated
over
and
over
again
to
them
between
her
bursts
of
laughter
did
i
not
tell
you
that
if
ye
came
to
the
corner
of
the
tower
ye
would
get
something
for
your
private
ear
this
will
learn
you
to
let
wee
davie
alane
there
remains
yet
one
other
of
their
pranks
to
be
told
and
that
only
because
it
is
knit
into
the
story
and
so
must
be
unravelled
along
with
it
the
pair
of
elders
after
this
defeat
at
the
hands
of
nell
and
little
david
took
counsel
together
and
might
sooner
have
hit
upon
something
to
their
mind
but
that
james
as
was
usual
with
him
stood
in
an
attitude
of
cogitation
having
his
mouth
very
wide
open
whereat
sandy
whose
wits
were
brighter
could
not
even
for
the
sake
of
the
alliance
between
them
refrain
from
dropping
therein
a
snowball
which
he
had
ready
in
his
hand
for
any
purpose
that
might
arise
this
he
did
with
the
same
neatness
and
adroitness
with
which
he
would
have
dropped
a
ball
of
worset
yarn
when
the
caps
were
on
the
green
for
the
game
royal
of
it
took
some
time
and
a
mighty
deal
of
struggling
on
the
ground
before
this
treachery
between
friends
could
be
arranged
also
much
thrusting
of
snow
down
the
backs
of
doublets
and
holding
it
there
till
it
with
other
still
more
unseemly
and
uncomfortable
proceedings
then
the
reconciled
allies
entered
the
castle
together
promising
peace
and
fell
into
talk
with
young
davie
who
stood
within
the
great
door
in
the
inviolate
safety
of
the
hall
do
you
want
a
merk
said
sandy
tempting
him
with
the
sight
of
one
which
at
that
day
was
great
wealth
it
will
buy
store
of
peaches
and
pears
and
baked
apples
at
baillie
underwood
s
in
the
high
street
preserved
cherries
also
and
marmalit
of
then
said
davie
a
merk
i
want
indeed
as
does
everyone
but
you
are
not
the
fellow
to
give
it
me
therefore
quit
your
pother
for
i
know
that
you
would
only
make
friends
to
get
me
apart
and
so
work
mischief
upon
a
wise
boy
david
as
i
live
i
lie
not
said
sandy
taking
a
great
oath
i
will
give
you
the
merk
if
ye
go
down
after
dark
to
the
barn
and
passing
through
the
great
door
to
the
lesser
door
at
the
back
shut
and
bolt
it
with
its
bar
of
oak
and
so
return
the
way
ye
went
if
ye
do
this
sure
as
death
i
lie
not
i
will
give
you
the
little
david
who
had
ofttimes
been
deceived
of
his
brothers
considered
upon
the
offer
a
while
and
at
last
he
said
to
sandy
as
sure
as
death
ye
might
lie
though
twice
ye
have
said
it
but
give
the
merk
into
the
keeping
of
launce
kennedy
that
will
not
tell
lies
at
least
not
for
such
freits
and
then
i
will
take
your
dare
and
go
shut
the
further
door
of
the
they
came
up
therefore
to
me
to
the
armoury
james
sandy
and
david
all
together
and
as
soon
as
i
heard
them
coming
i
went
from
the
window
and
sat
by
the
fire
that
they
might
not
suspect
i
had
observed
aught
of
their
matters
then
when
they
revealed
the
plot
to
me
i
bade
sandy
be
careful
what
he
did
for
it
was
growing
dark
and
i
misdoubted
that
they
meant
to
fright
the
child
so
i
feared
them
with
the
threat
of
their
father
and
as
little
david
lingered
while
his
brothers
went
lumbering
and
shouting
down
the
armoury
stair
i
put
into
his
hand
a
short
blackthorn
cudgel
which
the
young
sheriff
of
galloway
had
brought
with
him
over
from
ireland
if
ye
see
anything
more
than
common
hit
it
as
hard
as
ye
can
with
that
i
bade
him
and
so
little
david
passed
out
i
could
not
see
him
far
across
the
yard
because
of
the
fall
of
the
gloaming
but
on
his
return
all
of
sweat
and
in
a
quivering
tremble
of
agony
he
told
me
what
had
befallen
him
it
was
bitter
cold
he
said
and
i
will
not
say
that
i
was
not
feared
for
i
was
yet
so
long
as
the
door
stood
ajar
there
came
a
ray
of
light
through
it
and
my
heart
was
cheered
but
presently
it
was
shut
to
and
i
had
all
the
way
to
go
alone
but
i
heard
the
cows
in
the
byre
rattling
at
their
hemps
through
the
rings
and
as
i
kenned
pulling
at
the
meadow
hay
in
their
stalls
and
that
at
least
was
some
company
so
i
went
on
and
the
frosty
snow
squeaked
under
my
feet
i
came
to
the
great
door
of
the
barn
it
stood
open
vast
and
terrible
as
the
mouth
of
a
giant
s
cave
but
i
thought
of
the
marmalit
of
plums
and
in
i
went
with
my
heart
high
in
my
i
nodded
at
the
little
fellow
for
many
a
time
had
i
felt
the
same
and
said
nothing
about
i
was
much
younger
of
course
so
said
he
i
went
through
the
barn
in
which
was
such
hay
and
straw
till
i
came
to
the
midst
of
it
here
i
stopped
to
listen
for
i
could
hear
a
noise
indeed
many
noises
however
it
was
only
the
black
rattons
firsling
among
the
straw
i
felt
a
thousand
miles
away
from
home
an
orphan
and
very
did
thinking
on
marmalit
of
plums
now
bring
least
none
to
speak
of
but
nevertheless
because
i
thought
of
the
taunting
and
japing
of
james
and
sandy
i
took
my
way
to
the
further
door
that
looketh
upon
the
old
orchard
the
black
shut
out
many
of
the
stars
but
those
that
were
left
tingled
and
shone
cold
i
thought
i
had
no
friend
nearer
than
one
of
these
i
was
much
afraid
yet
nevertheless
i
shut
the
back
door
and
barred
it
good
and
strong
with
both
bolts
and
set
a
at
the
back
for
luck
this
being
done
i
turned
and
took
but
one
step
towards
the
great
door
through
which
i
could
see
the
snow
shining
like
a
mist
then
my
heart
stopped
and
i
tried
to
cry
out
very
loud
but
alas
i
could
not
cry
out
at
all
for
there
was
something
in
the
doorway
i
could
see
it
against
the
snow
something
that
crawled
on
the
ground
with
dull
horrid
eyes
set
wide
apart
and
that
turned
a
shapeless
horned
head
slowly
from
side
to
side
moaning
and
yammering
the
while
i
thought
i
should
die
then
i
feared
that
i
should
not
die
before
the
thing
took
me
for
it
slowly
invaded
the
barn
till
it
filled
all
the
doorway
by
this
i
knew
that
i
should
indeed
be
devoured
nevertheless
i
minded
what
it
was
you
said
before
i
went
so
i
thought
that
having
a
stout
stick
in
my
hand
i
might
as
well
die
after
having
smitten
a
good
stroke
as
bravo
young
david
cried
i
that
is
the
right
spirit
of
so
i
took
the
blackthorn
in
both
hands
he
went
on
and
swung
it
about
my
head
as
you
showed
me
in
the
hagging
down
of
trees
with
that
i
struck
the
horrible
thing
fairly
between
the
eyes
then
leaping
over
it
i
ran
how
i
know
not
for
the
house
i
laughed
and
wept
time
about
till
nell
brought
me
here
that
you
might
bid
me
stop
now
i
want
the
so
i
gave
him
the
merk
took
down
the
from
the
nail
where
it
hung
and
went
out
to
look
for
jamie
and
well
i
knew
that
this
had
been
one
of
their
tricks
to
frighten
the
boy
and
i
was
resolved
that
they
should
take
a
thrashing
either
from
me
or
what
they
would
less
desire
from
their
though
a
kind
enough
man
till
he
began
to
lay
on
was
apt
to
be
carried
away
with
the
exercise
and
to
forget
bowels
of
mercy
but
when
i
got
upon
the
snow
by
the
door
sandy
came
running
to
me
fairly
crying
out
with
terror
he
had
the
hide
of
a
muckle
bullock
which
had
been
killed
that
day
trailing
from
his
waist
his
face
in
the
light
that
fell
from
the
lamp
in
the
hall
was
a
sight
to
be
seen
there
was
a
lump
on
his
brow
between
the
eyes
as
large
to
a
nearness
as
a
hen
s
egg
all
his
face
was
with
blood
so
that
for
the
moment
i
thought
that
the
lad
had
really
been
killed
but
when
i
pulled
him
up
to
the
armoury
and
got
him
washed
i
found
that
the
blood
was
only
that
of
the
bullock
whose
hide
he
had
wrapped
about
him
in
order
that
he
might
crawl
on
the
ground
and
fright
his
brother
david
and
i
had
there
and
then
taken
him
to
task
with
the
for
indeed
he
might
have
bereft
the
child
of
reason
but
the
sight
of
his
own
wordless
terror
smote
upon
me
so
that
i
that
time
at
least
for
a
while
sandy
could
not
speak
by
reason
of
the
fear
which
blanched
his
face
and
caused
him
to
hold
by
my
coat
even
when
i
went
across
the
room
at
last
however
he
found
tongue
there
is
a
man
he
stammered
a
man
with
a
drawn
sword
standing
at
the
barn
end
in
a
grey
cloak
and
a
wild
beast
crouching
beside
said
i
for
i
believed
not
a
word
of
it
your
head
is
muzzy
with
your
carrying
the
bullock
s
head
and
horns
and
serve
you
right
had
david
given
you
a
warble
on
it
twice
as
no
gasped
sandy
it
is
not
fantasy
i
saw
the
man
clearly
he
stood
against
the
sky
in
a
grey
cloak
and
the
beast
crouched
and
held
a
lanthorn
by
him
oh
launce
i
fear
i
have
seen
the
black
man
and
that
i
shall
seen
your
granny
s
said
i
roughly
for
i
was
angry
at
his
senselessness
lay
raw
beef
to
your
my
man
sleep
here
with
me
and
i
will
forgive
you
the
licking
with
the
so
by
little
and
little
i
got
sandy
soothed
down
till
he
went
to
sleep
on
my
bed
moaning
and
tossing
the
while
then
i
set
me
down
to
think
alone
on
the
above
the
courtyard
for
i
had
long
since
handed
david
over
to
the
care
of
nell
sometimes
for
convenience
i
slept
in
the
armoury
for
sir
thomas
had
trusted
me
with
everything
since
i
had
proved
myself
in
the
wars
i
saw
well
that
evil
was
somehow
intended
against
the
house
of
culzean
and
that
something
terrible
walked
in
darkness
i
resolved
that
i
should
find
out
what
it
was
or
die
yet
i
liked
not
stealthy
adventure
so
much
as
plain
cut
and
thrust
and
wished
that
i
had
had
robert
harburgh
with
me
but
i
knew
that
though
brave
as
a
lion
he
somewhat
lacked
discretion
and
so
might
spoil
all
there
was
nothing
for
it
therefore
but
to
go
out
alone
the
having
shut
and
locked
the
armoury
door
behind
me
i
stood
a
great
while
very
still
on
the
steps
in
the
black
shadow
for
nothing
could
i
see
though
i
looked
till
my
eyes
ached
so
i
set
out
with
my
sword
bare
in
my
hand
and
my
left
hand
hafting
an
dagger
i
declare
if
i
had
only
known
for
certain
that
the
thing
which
troubled
the
house
was
naught
but
flesh
and
blood
i
had
not
cared
the
tickling
of
a
flemish
poulet
for
i
was
growing
to
rejoice
in
adventure
believing
that
my
own
luck
was
to
win
through
in
safety
whatever
might
befall
to
others
indeed
i
never
loved
a
life
like
that
of
a
burgher
or
a
cellarer
but
rather
to
strip
and
lay
on
till
the
arm
dirls
with
is
in
a
just
cause
of
course
although
sometimes
if
your
chief
so
command
one
must
strike
without
inquiring
with
too
queasy
a
conscience
like
a
mere
knave
what
may
be
the
cause
for
which
ye
are
set
to
drive
the
steel
for
it
is
soldierly
to
strike
first
and
inquire
the
cause
is
if
the
man
live
but
i
ride
the
wild
mare
whenever
i
lay
the
reins
on
the
neck
of
my
and
since
i
love
to
keep
the
pages
even
and
the
lines
straight
anything
that
will
serve
to
fill
up
the
tale
of
my
day
s
doing
goes
down
but
pleasant
writing
maketh
not
always
good
or
reading
i
stood
therefore
awhile
outside
the
armoury
door
and
saw
only
the
drifted
snow
and
the
line
of
white
roofs
against
a
dark
sky
so
having
little
hope
of
discovery
by
waiting
like
a
dancer
outside
a
ring
i
stepped
lightly
down
being
shod
in
soft
double
hosen
without
leathern
shoon
so
that
my
feet
made
no
noise
on
the
frosty
snow
about
the
house
i
stole
gliding
from
shelter
to
shelter
till
i
came
to
the
edge
of
the
cliff
where
i
could
hear
but
not
see
the
breaker
waves
crisping
and
clapping
upon
the
shore
at
such
a
time
the
sea
is
black
but
so
much
blacker
was
the
night
that
i
saw
it
not
even
when
i
looked
straight
down
upon
it
turning
i
made
the
circuit
of
the
castle
but
still
found
nothing
then
i
minded
me
how
it
was
by
the
barn
that
sandy
had
seen
the
vision
which
had
affrighted
him
so
i
set
teeth
and
gripped
blade
tighter
and
took
my
way
to
the
barn
door
it
stood
wide
and
vacant
gaping
at
me
like
an
open
sepulchre
i
will
admit
that
it
required
all
my
courage
boldly
to
go
in
for
it
is
hard
to
enter
that
which
is
the
blackness
of
darkness
to
you
with
the
knowledge
that
all
the
while
you
stand
the
fairest
of
targets
in
the
doorway
but
because
as
my
father
had
told
me
it
is
ever
better
to
pursue
than
to
flee
i
stepped
within
with
elbow
crooked
for
the
thrust
and
dagger
arm
cleared
of
the
cloak
but
it
was
as
silent
in
the
barn
as
elsewhere
i
did
not
even
hear
the
rats
of
which
my
little
david
had
spoken
i
began
to
think
that
i
had
been
as
needlessly
and
as
childlessly
alarmed
as
he
then
all
at
once
and
quite
clearly
i
heard
voices
speaking
together
at
the
outer
corner
of
the
granary
so
i
went
near
to
a
convenient
wicket
that
i
might
listen
and
my
very
heart
and
life
chilled
and
thickened
because
that
the
voices
were
those
of
our
marjorie
and
someone
else
who
spoke
low
and
quick
and
high
like
gilbert
kennedy
then
was
my
heart
full
of
disgust
that
i
should
find
her
whom
i
had
loved
and
worshipped
engaging
in
another
midnight
tryst
and
one
that
might
be
no
better
than
a
paltry
intrigue
so
angered
was
i
that
i
stole
to
the
door
meaning
to
break
out
upon
them
in
violent
speech
caring
little
in
mine
anger
what
should
happen
but
as
i
came
to
the
edge
of
the
marjorie
kennedy
came
to
the
door
swiftly
turning
in
front
of
the
barn
and
standing
with
the
shawl
thrown
back
from
her
head
she
spoke
to
the
man
she
had
left
whom
as
yet
i
saw
not
remember
she
said
i
promise
no
more
than
the
bare
fact
i
tell
you
i
choose
the
grave
before
a
the
worm
before
such
a
husband
but
the
man
to
whom
she
spoke
uttered
no
word
though
he
had
come
nearer
to
where
in
the
dusk
of
the
doorway
i
stood
with
my
sword
bare
in
my
hand
i
could
see
him
plainly
but
his
face
for
the
tide
of
darkness
was
on
the
ebb
he
was
the
tall
cloaked
man
whom
we
knew
as
the
grey
man
behind
him
at
the
angle
of
the
wall
crouched
a
black
mass
which
yet
was
even
as
i
looked
it
took
something
from
under
a
coat
and
rose
erect
beside
the
grey
man
as
marjorie
vanished
these
two
figures
moved
towards
my
in
the
barn
i
had
no
time
to
do
more
than
glide
within
pull
a
sheaf
or
two
from
the
mow
and
thrust
myself
like
a
sword
into
its
scabbard
within
the
hole
i
had
made
amid
the
piled
grain
even
as
i
looked
their
dark
figures
filled
up
the
square
of
greyness
which
the
open
barn
door
made
against
the
snow
i
saw
them
enter
feeling
with
their
hands
as
though
to
grasp
something
yet
not
making
any
light
to
guide
them
in
finding
it
then
indeed
i
was
disquieted
and
my
very
bones
became
as
water
within
me
for
if
there
is
anything
trying
to
the
flesh
of
mortal
man
it
is
to
lie
still
and
be
groped
for
in
the
dark
by
unknown
and
horrible
enemies
i
had
a
nightmare
sense
of
powerlessness
to
move
of
impotence
in
the
face
of
peril
i
knew
that
when
the
blind
groping
inhuman
horror
took
me
by
the
throat
i
should
not
be
able
even
to
cry
out
it
was
like
a
dream
of
fever
made
real
a
moment
after
i
heard
a
man
s
voice
speak
in
a
fierce
whisper
ah
here
it
is
give
me
your
hand
and
put
strength
to
then
in
a
moment
like
the
breaking
of
a
dam
the
fear
quite
went
from
me
they
were
but
robbers
after
all
and
i
a
craven
and
a
coward
to
lie
still
while
my
master
s
goods
were
being
stolen
before
my
eyes
i
leaped
out
upon
them
without
waiting
to
think
for
i
was
not
feared
of
a
dozen
such
hold
i
cried
stand
for
your
lives
or
i
will
run
you
through
i
stood
in
the
doorway
with
my
sword
and
dagger
in
hand
and
as
soon
as
i
felt
one
come
against
the
point
of
my
blade
i
let
him
have
it
with
all
my
might
for
it
was
not
a
time
for
then
though
i
heard
the
answering
cry
of
wounding
there
was
no
time
for
further
action
for
something
came
at
me
with
a
rush
like
a
wild
beast
of
the
wood
and
the
snarl
of
the
springing
heather
cat
now
there
are
many
things
that
a
lad
of
eighteen
or
nineteen
may
of
worth
and
he
can
not
stand
against
the
weight
of
a
strong
and
man
when
he
leaps
upon
him
therefore
i
can
not
count
it
to
my
shame
that
now
i
was
overcome
and
overborne
once
and
again
was
i
smitten
till
i
felt
the
iron
as
it
had
been
fire
strike
me
here
and
there
and
though
i
felt
no
pain
there
was
something
warm
which
i
divined
to
be
my
own
blood
running
down
then
i
knew
no
more
when
i
awoke
i
was
in
the
grieve
s
house
lying
on
a
bed
sir
thomas
kennedy
my
master
and
the
earl
himself
were
bending
over
me
they
had
unclasped
my
hand
and
now
stood
back
in
wonderment
at
what
they
found
gripped
in
it
it
is
the
key
of
the
treasure
chest
of
key
with
my
father
the
king
of
carrick
s
seal
graven
upon
it
where
could
the
lad
have
gotten
it
yet
of
a
certainty
they
had
taken
it
out
of
my
hand
which
had
been
fixed
upon
something
ever
since
they
found
me
on
the
barn
where
i
lay
senseless
in
a
pool
of
my
own
blood
secret
of
the
it
was
i
can
avouch
a
strange
experience
for
me
to
lie
on
my
back
in
the
grieve
s
house
all
through
the
long
days
of
spring
and
summer
kate
allison
and
her
mother
were
tirelessly
kind
the
grieve
himself
generally
set
his
head
past
the
door
as
he
went
and
came
from
his
meals
crying
mayhap
something
of
the
it
was
warm
or
that
it
was
a
wat
yin
and
thinking
it
the
height
of
a
jest
to
say
to
me
an
what
kind
o
weather
hae
ye
below
the
blankets
for
with
country
folk
a
little
jest
goes
a
great
way
and
serveth
as
long
without
washing
as
a
pair
of
english
blankets
then
in
the
forenoon
sir
thomas
would
come
in
from
the
castle
opening
the
hallan
door
and
walking
across
the
grieve
s
kitchen
as
unceremoniously
as
he
would
have
done
in
his
own
house
my
lad
they
have
made
a
hand
of
you
but
we
will
dowse
them
yet
for
that
was
one
of
his
stated
encouragements
to
me
let
me
see
the
man
they
will
never
mar
you
on
your
marriage
day
and
so
kindly
and
smiling
he
would
pass
out
again
walking
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
as
far
as
i
could
see
him
along
the
arches
of
the
woodland
then
would
marjorie
come
to
the
door
and
inquire
for
me
of
good
mistress
allison
but
she
never
accepted
of
her
hearty
invite
to
at
least
to
enter
and
see
the
invalid
gently
would
she
ask
after
my
and
being
assured
of
it
as
gently
would
she
go
her
fair
face
looking
so
white
and
sorrowful
the
while
that
i
was
wae
for
her
and
for
the
unkenned
secrets
of
her
heart
into
which
god
forbid
that
i
should
pry
but
that
which
cheered
me
most
i
think
was
the
kindness
and
showed
me
without
stint
both
by
nell
kennedy
and
kate
allison
they
were
no
longer
flighty
and
sharp
of
tongue
in
speaking
to
me
but
rather
spoke
freely
and
sat
much
in
the
kitchen
with
the
door
of
my
room
open
so
that
i
could
see
them
nipping
and
scarting
at
one
another
like
kittens
in
their
wantonness
which
was
a
great
diversion
and
encouragement
to
me
on
my
weary
bed
and
there
we
had
no
little
merriment
for
nell
kennedy
would
be
saucy
and
miscall
me
for
my
laziness
and
for
my
lack
of
appetite
which
she
called
dainty
and
dorty
meaning
thereby
that
i
wanted
finer
meats
than
they
had
to
give
me
also
though
she
was
no
maid
for
gossip
nell
would
bring
me
all
the
clash
of
the
and
all
the
talk
that
was
gone
over
in
the
mill
while
the
thirlage
men
waited
for
their
grist
where
she
got
it
to
tell
me
i
can
not
imagine
but
it
was
all
like
sweet
wine
to
me
that
could
hear
naught
most
of
the
day
and
night
but
the
birds
singing
without
and
mistress
allison
clattering
wooden
platters
within
also
and
that
was
the
kindliest
thing
she
could
have
done
and
touched
my
heart
most
of
all
she
brought
to
me
all
my
and
accoutrements
my
sword
which
she
had
cleaned
herself
after
the
scuffle
in
the
barn
the
dagger
i
had
dropped
when
i
caught
and
clutched
the
key
of
the
kelwood
treasure
wherever
that
had
been
pistols
the
fine
new
hackbutt
which
had
just
come
from
the
town
of
ayr
and
which
sir
thomas
had
given
me
for
mine
own
as
he
would
have
given
a
child
a
toy
give
the
bairn
its
plaiks
then
said
nell
as
she
laid
them
on
the
bed
would
it
love
to
play
with
them
then
it
shall
she
spoke
in
an
enticing
and
babyish
way
that
diverted
me
and
warmed
me
too
when
i
thought
she
had
so
much
kindliness
for
me
so
i
said
it
is
monstrously
well
done
of
you
thus
to
divert
hoots
she
said
see
what
else
i
have
brought
and
with
that
she
took
from
her
pocket
all
the
apparatus
of
cleaning
my
pieces
and
sword
besides
the
links
and
buckles
of
dom
nicholas
s
harness
and
equipment
the
sight
of
which
put
me
in
a
fever
to
see
him
again
never
was
anything
kindlier
done
also
she
brought
me
from
her
father
s
scanty
library
such
books
as
she
thought
i
might
care
to
read
though
indeed
i
read
but
little
never
having
been
greatly
given
to
as
it
might
be
books
of
songs
wits
recreations
and
such
like
but
amongst
others
she
brought
me
a
french
manual
of
fence
which
gave
me
infinite
pleasure
for
with
her
help
i
could
spell
out
the
instructions
and
the
plates
of
positions
i
was
fain
to
imitate
with
my
two
rapiers
till
i
had
hacked
and
scarred
all
the
four
posts
of
the
bed
most
grievously
and
mistress
allison
declared
that
it
was
not
safe
for
anyone
to
come
within
the
outer
door
but
one
day
my
stood
mine
hostess
in
good
stead
for
which
afterwards
she
gave
me
full
thankfulness
it
chanced
on
a
certain
noontide
of
heat
that
all
were
at
the
hayfield
even
kate
and
nell
had
gone
to
toss
the
hay
which
is
a
pleasant
thing
to
do
in
good
company
but
i
faith
ill
enough
to
think
on
as
i
lay
tossing
my
weary
body
and
cursing
the
luck
that
tied
me
here
in
a
dull
with
heat
the
weight
of
bedclothing
and
the
broad
buzzing
flies
which
would
light
on
the
corner
of
one
s
nose
each
time
that
sleep
was
on
the
verge
of
flapping
down
silently
with
his
black
wings
to
bring
a
welcome
shortening
of
the
weary
hours
mistress
allison
stole
about
the
kitchen
on
bare
broad
feet
flapping
and
slapping
the
flags
with
them
as
she
carried
her
cakes
to
the
girdle
plate
or
swung
it
from
the
cleek
above
the
clear
baking
fire
of
brown
peats
she
thought
me
asleep
for
i
had
cleaned
all
my
arms
till
i
could
see
myself
sitting
up
in
bed
with
my
pale
face
and
towsed
haystack
of
a
head
in
every
square
inch
of
them
kate
had
brought
me
that
day
a
book
called
whole
duty
of
but
finding
it
full
of
religious
reflections
and
not
tales
of
the
crusaders
as
i
had
hoped
i
laid
it
aside
for
the
sabbath
day
as
being
more
reverent
and
fitting
all
at
once
the
outer
door
of
the
grieve
s
house
was
thrown
back
on
its
hinges
and
a
great
sturdy
caird
an
egyptian
sorner
or
bold
robber
such
as
were
vexing
the
realm
at
the
time
or
perhaps
only
a
common
muddy
rascal
of
the
road
mistress
i
bid
you
he
said
i
am
hungry
and
would
have
meat
plain
and
quite
short
he
said
as
i
have
written
it
down
in
this
grieve
s
house
of
culzean
even
gentry
folk
say
an
it
please
you
and
by
your
leave
replied
with
some
indignation
the
mistress
of
the
dwelling
but
then
i
will
e
en
help
myself
without
please
or
leave
either
cried
the
villain
and
with
that
he
opened
a
leathern
wallet
that
he
had
slung
over
his
shoulder
and
began
to
thrust
therein
not
only
the
scones
but
anything
about
the
dresser
and
tables
that
his
thievish
fancy
lit
upon
now
mistress
said
he
let
me
have
any
siller
you
have
in
the
house
and
a
kiss
of
your
moo
therewith
or
else
i
must
do
my
needs
with
you
and
with
that
he
opened
a
great
gully
knife
as
though
he
would
run
at
her
mistress
allison
cried
out
with
a
strange
cry
of
woman
s
fear
which
i
who
had
been
in
battle
never
heard
the
like
of
before
just
at
this
moment
i
pushed
the
bedroom
door
open
with
the
point
of
my
toe
and
sat
there
looking
straight
at
the
man
with
a
pistol
bended
in
each
hand
and
both
of
them
trained
point
blank
on
the
rascal
s
heart
i
make
bold
to
say
that
in
all
this
realm
of
scotland
there
was
not
any
man
so
exceedingly
astonished
as
this
particular
sturdy
thief
at
that
moment
drop
the
knife
sirrah
i
commanded
as
one
that
cries
his
orders
in
a
battle
and
the
knife
rang
obediently
on
the
stone
floor
kick
it
into
the
corner
with
your
no
not
with
your
and
reluctantly
he
kicked
the
knife
away
from
him
now
my
excellent
good
man
said
i
sit
you
down
and
put
your
hands
behind
you
there
and
thus
be
still
where
you
are
quite
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
not
so
he
sat
him
down
and
keeping
my
pistols
dead
upon
him
i
bade
mistress
allison
tie
his
hands
firmly
with
cord
and
give
him
a
settle
to
lean
against
thereafter
i
comforted
him
with
stern
philosophy
i
told
him
of
his
wandering
and
uncertain
life
i
showed
him
conclusively
how
that
he
went
ever
in
danger
of
the
hangman
s
whip
and
that
at
the
end
there
could
only
be
awaiting
for
him
a
shameful
death
i
told
him
also
that
our
overlord
of
culzean
had
the
power
of
pit
and
gallows
and
that
on
the
return
of
the
haymakers
he
should
be
brought
in
an
hour
there
would
be
an
end
of
all
his
misery
upon
the
or
tree
of
execution
which
stands
by
the
great
gate
and
bears
medlars
at
any
season
but
only
for
an
hour
at
a
time
tis
the
most
cruel
and
unjust
treatment
of
poor
beset
far
wandering
men
said
the
man
on
the
floor
they
were
the
first
words
he
had
spoken
since
he
threw
down
his
knife
i
wondered
he
could
speak
so
well
we
have
heard
no
complaints
so
far
i
made
answer
drily
for
the
man
s
former
insolence
stuck
in
my
throat
and
in
especial
the
thought
of
what
might
have
happened
to
mine
hostess
or
the
maids
had
i
not
been
there
upon
the
bed
with
my
weapons
beside
me
so
i
kept
him
in
torment
of
mind
for
a
space
at
last
as
the
afternoon
ebbed
away
and
the
hour
of
sundown
and
homecoming
wore
on
his
anxiety
waxed
pitiful
he
turned
and
twisted
to
free
his
hands
so
that
the
only
way
i
could
quiet
him
was
to
lift
a
pistol
and
point
it
at
him
but
even
that
did
not
appear
to
soothe
him
for
any
length
of
time
at
last
he
raised
his
head
master
said
he
sullenly
but
speaking
not
that
ill
ye
have
me
i
grant
in
the
cleaving
of
a
stick
now
i
will
tell
you
a
thing
you
greatly
desire
to
know
will
ye
promise
to
let
me
go
and
i
will
never
meddle
you
more
i
do
not
mean
that
you
should
said
i
nevertheless
what
is
the
thing
that
you
can
tell
me
and
when
i
know
i
shall
judge
its
the
honour
of
a
i
can
tell
you
said
he
where
you
will
find
the
treasure
of
kelwood
what
blethers
i
cried
scornfully
pray
how
am
i
to
know
that
you
speak
the
truth
ye
may
tell
me
that
it
is
with
the
gold
cup
at
the
end
of
the
rainbow
it
is
true
said
the
man
i
might
lie
to
you
but
i
will
not
for
i
need
my
life
it
is
sweet
to
me
as
yours
to
how
can
such
a
life
be
sweet
i
asked
daffing
with
the
man
in
my
was
bad
form
as
john
mure
himself
sayeth
in
his
history
of
the
troubles
it
is
not
a
time
to
argue
said
he
but
my
life
is
as
pleasant
as
the
trees
that
toss
their
branches
and
as
the
free
life
of
the
too
free
altogether
said
i
thus
to
come
in
and
threaten
the
life
and
honour
of
a
decent
woman
we
must
have
such
freedom
trussed
and
stretched
on
a
tow
i
did
but
fright
her
said
he
sullenly
that
is
as
may
be
replied
i
keeping
my
pistol
trained
for
his
left
and
in
any
case
it
will
be
all
the
same
in
two
but
said
he
hear
me
concerning
the
treasure
of
kelwood
ye
have
conquest
the
key
i
can
tell
you
where
the
box
itself
is
for
if
i
win
clear
this
time
i
must
escape
over
seas
from
the
vengeance
of
the
grey
but
you
may
lie
even
as
you
have
stolen
and
i
fear
me
murdered
also
for
by
your
talk
you
are
one
of
a
murderous
of
the
lying
you
must
e
en
take
your
as
after
telling
you
i
must
take
my
chance
of
your
cutting
my
bonds
and
letting
me
you
have
a
gentleman
s
word
i
answered
him
and
how
much
is
that
worth
in
carrick
this
day
he
said
harshly
and
bitterly
even
with
a
bond
to
back
it
mine
said
i
with
what
dignity
i
could
muster
is
worth
as
much
as
truth
itself
i
grant
was
but
a
windy
saying
i
believe
it
and
i
will
trust
it
said
he
the
treasure
of
kelwood
is
in
the
cave
of
sawny
bean
on
the
seashore
of
bennanbrack
over
against
the
hill
of
and
not
another
word
would
he
say
so
when
mistress
allison
had
locked
herself
in
the
and
advised
me
that
the
haymakers
were
in
full
sight
i
caused
my
man
to
roll
himself
to
the
door
of
the
bedroom
there
with
my
sword
i
cut
the
bonds
now
said
i
take
the
door
sharply
without
so
much
as
going
to
the
other
side
for
your
bundle
or
your
knife
and
then
the
woods
are
open
to
you
and
the
world
i
thank
you
master
he
said
civilly
when
you
go
for
the
treasure
i
counsel
you
do
not
call
on
sandy
by
your
leasome
and
with
that
caution
he
betook
himself
into
the
glades
of
the
wood
ancient
after
he
was
gone
i
cast
about
in
my
mind
and
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
not
decide
whether
the
fellow
had
been
lying
to
me
or
not
it
was
indeed
a
thing
to
be
wondered
at
how
this
chance
scoundrel
should
know
what
i
had
thought
known
only
to
my
lord
of
cassillis
and
my
master
that
after
the
fight
in
the
barn
i
had
carried
away
clenched
in
my
hand
the
key
of
the
treasure
chest
of
kelwood
now
as
was
natural
after
this
encounter
the
goodwife
of
the
grieve
s
house
could
not
make
enough
of
me
indeed
if
anything
she
made
too
much
of
me
for
instead
of
suffering
her
daughter
and
nell
to
entertain
me
as
before
while
she
went
about
her
work
she
thought
it
her
duty
as
soon
as
one
of
them
came
in
and
sat
down
to
leave
that
which
she
was
about
and
come
and
sit
with
us
for
company
now
mistress
allison
was
a
good
woman
and
agreeable
of
her
tongue
but
i
did
not
feel
the
necessity
for
this
byordinar
kindness
yet
it
was
not
easy
to
alter
it
then
in
the
evenings
came
robert
harburgh
to
see
me
at
first
he
came
once
a
week
while
my
wounds
kept
me
weak
and
fretful
then
as
i
grew
better
he
came
twice
and
when
i
was
able
to
sit
up
it
came
about
that
he
would
arrive
every
night
and
bide
till
that
at
last
i
was
almost
shamed
to
have
him
sitting
there
and
feared
that
he
might
be
burdensome
to
kate
allison
and
her
mother
for
robert
harburgh
had
but
little
to
say
but
he
ever
looked
and
proved
kindly
also
he
brought
me
many
things
from
maybole
and
and
wine
that
had
been
shipped
to
irvine
from
foreign
parts
neckerchiefs
also
for
kate
and
her
mother
a
quiet
fellow
was
robert
something
dull
of
the
uptake
and
with
little
to
say
for
himself
but
a
most
noble
sworder
and
wholly
without
care
for
his
body
when
it
came
to
the
fighting
now
it
seems
a
strange
thing
that
i
who
had
so
long
played
the
lover
to
kate
allison
should
be
laid
by
the
heels
in
her
father
s
house
hearing
the
whip
and
frisk
of
her
gown
about
the
chambers
all
the
day
and
i
still
loved
to
hear
it
for
she
was
a
bonny
kind
kind
to
me
also
her
eyes
were
pleasant
and
had
both
mischief
and
tears
in
like
nell
kennedy
s
that
held
only
mischief
and
once
as
it
seemed
to
me
a
little
while
when
i
was
deadly
fevered
and
when
dr
low
of
ayr
the
earl
of
cassillis
s
own
physician
ordered
me
and
shook
his
doting
wiseacre
s
head
over
me
like
a
most
melancholious
then
for
a
little
nell
s
eyes
were
quiet
and
sorrowful
but
it
did
not
last
for
by
the
time
that
i
could
get
a
scheme
laid
to
take
advantage
of
the
gleam
of
kindness
she
was
again
but
mine
own
of
a
nell
and
we
were
throng
at
the
sparring
and
quarrelling
just
as
usual
but
as
i
say
kate
allison
was
wondrously
kind
to
me
many
a
night
when
the
weather
was
hot
and
my
wounds
paining
me
as
though
they
would
break
again
open
would
she
sit
by
me
with
clear
caller
water
from
the
spring
tirelessly
changing
the
soft
linen
cloths
and
when
the
drops
of
stood
on
my
brow
she
would
touch
them
gently
away
and
lay
her
own
cool
cheek
against
my
forehead
ay
and
when
i
put
my
hand
up
and
drew
down
her
face
she
would
kiss
me
right
frankly
upon
the
lips
yet
as
i
judged
not
quite
as
of
old
but
i
thought
it
might
be
the
illness
that
made
the
difference
for
with
being
sick
in
body
and
feverish
in
mind
nothing
tastes
the
same
and
so
i
thought
it
might
be
also
with
kisses
but
after
i
had
grown
stronger
i
shall
ever
mind
me
of
one
night
when
i
got
a
horrid
awakening
it
was
a
quiet
gloaming
kate
allison
and
i
had
the
house
to
which
speaking
for
myself
i
did
not
wholly
object
i
lay
stretched
upon
the
long
oaken
settle
on
cushions
which
nell
kennedy
had
brought
from
the
great
house
kate
sat
beside
me
on
a
stool
and
leaned
an
elbow
on
the
oak
s
edge
she
was
unwontedly
silent
and
sometimes
i
touched
her
cheek
lightly
with
my
hand
it
was
a
most
pleasant
night
and
my
mind
was
full
of
pity
and
consideration
for
her
i
bethought
me
that
though
doubtless
i
could
have
looked
higher
i
might
do
worse
in
time
than
think
of
settling
down
with
a
sweet
and
pleasant
lass
like
kate
allison
it
was
also
touching
to
me
that
she
should
never
have
wavered
from
loving
me
all
the
time
that
i
had
been
forgetting
her
and
thinking
of
others
but
that
i
said
to
myself
is
the
way
of
women
we
were
silent
a
great
while
with
the
silence
that
needs
no
speech
and
my
heart
had
grown
melting
and
kindly
to
the
young
lass
even
as
it
had
been
in
old
days
all
of
a
sudden
she
spoke
launce
said
she
i
m
going
to
be
married
she
never
moved
her
head
off
my
shoulder
leaning
with
her
elbow
on
the
edge
of
the
settle
and
looking
away
from
me
out
at
the
door
neither
did
she
draw
her
hand
from
mine
but
rather
settled
it
the
more
kindly
nestling
it
in
my
palm
yet
anyone
might
have
knocked
me
off
the
oaken
settle
with
a
straw
married
said
i
ay
kate
lass
of
course
you
are
going
to
be
married
tis
what
you
and
i
must
come
to
i
assure
you
i
oftentimes
have
been
thinking
about
that
there
are
not
the
makings
of
an
old
maid
about
you
this
i
said
and
waited
for
the
answer
of
her
eyes
in
order
to
laugh
again
and
make
my
jest
but
she
did
not
look
at
me
i
do
not
think
she
heard
me
i
am
to
be
married
on
thursday
she
said
calmly
kate
allison
i
said
trying
to
turn
up
her
head
that
i
might
look
into
her
eyes
i
thought
to
see
the
in
them
but
as
women
know
how
to
do
she
evaded
me
without
seeming
to
be
conscious
of
it
why
kate
allison
sweetheart
said
i
how
can
i
be
ready
by
thursday
laid
here
on
my
back
with
only
you
to
care
for
me
i
am
to
be
married
on
thursday
to
robert
harburgh
she
said
then
i
drew
my
hand
away
and
sat
as
erect
and
stern
as
the
settle
and
my
sickness
would
let
me
for
it
is
hard
to
appear
dignified
and
like
a
soldier
lying
on
a
couch
and
wrapped
in
women
s
shawls
i
am
deceived
cried
i
mine
own
familiar
friend
in
whom
i
trusted
has
betrayed
me
coming
to
steal
that
which
was
dear
to
me
when
i
lay
most
weak
and
and
i
think
i
made
as
if
to
rise
for
i
had
an
idea
that
i
must
go
and
get
my
what
for
i
can
not
now
imagine
but
kate
allison
gently
put
me
back
on
the
pillows
and
sat
down
beside
me
taking
one
of
my
hands
again
laying
it
against
her
cheek
and
drawing
at
the
same
time
her
stool
nearer
to
me
i
tried
to
withdraw
my
hand
from
hers
but
being
weak
she
masterfully
kept
it
so
that
the
tears
sprang
to
my
eyes
for
very
helplessness
and
anger
you
have
played
with
me
and
deceived
me
kate
allison
i
cried
as
soon
as
i
could
command
my
voice
you
have
forgotten
the
old
days
and
all
that
we
were
to
one
nevertheless
kate
allison
never
winced
but
let
me
say
my
say
out
and
by
this
i
knew
that
the
old
days
were
gone
indeed
she
was
mightily
set
in
her
mind
launce
she
said
gently
launce
dear
sweetheart
am
fond
of
you
no
lass
in
carrick
but
would
like
you
for
a
lad
and
a
lover
even
for
your
very
feults
which
are
what
all
may
what
she
might
have
meant
i
have
even
yet
no
idea
ye
are
perfect
for
a
lad
that
comes
courting
and
i
liked
ye
and
like
ye
yet
but
i
saw
lang
syne
that
the
lads
that
court
best
are
not
the
men
that
marry
women
are
all
traitors
said
i
with
indignation
tingling
through
my
body
they
kiss
and
they
forget
and
then
in
a
trice
they
go
kiss
ay
replied
kate
allison
with
a
little
more
gravity
and
i
mean
to
have
a
short
word
with
you
on
that
very
she
paused
for
a
moment
and
looked
staidly
and
thoughtfully
out
of
the
window
i
believed
at
nineteen
that
i
wholly
understood
all
women
but
now
i
know
that
when
i
am
twice
that
and
more
the
simplest
seeming
of
them
will
be
able
to
wrap
me
in
her
and
sell
me
in
the
market
for
green
cabbage
listen
launce
my
dear
she
said
i
was
but
a
grieve
s
lass
and
not
unbonny
of
my
face
so
you
courted
me
you
longed
after
kissing
being
a
heartsome
lad
with
a
way
with
you
and
a
glint
in
your
e
e
and
so
you
kissed
me
and
in
my
youth
and
folly
i
said
ye
not
nay
but
you
went
over
the
hill
to
the
boreland
and
you
kissed
grace
and
you
kissed
the
lass
at
the
house
of
the
red
you
thought
that
i
would
never
know
it
and
more
you
expected
that
none
else
should
ever
come
near
to
kiss
me
ay
and
would
have
waxed
mightily
indignant
and
flashed
a
brave
sword
had
any
dared
for
that
is
the
excellent
way
of
the
lads
that
come
not
at
all
the
way
of
the
men
that
wise
women
i
was
mazed
and
confounded
before
her
but
could
not
answer
a
word
for
the
thing
was
as
true
as
if
she
had
read
my
heart
where
had
the
young
lass
so
learned
the
ways
of
men
forgotten
your
kisses
launce
she
went
on
and
what
of
them
i
count
kisses
but
as
the
x
s
and
o
s
that
bairns
make
on
the
flags
with
soft
cam
when
the
game
is
the
from
the
fair
at
maybole
and
the
kisses
that
you
and
i
then
kissed
said
i
bitterly
were
these
x
s
or
o
s
i
rede
ye
tell
me
launce
said
kate
allison
we
dreamed
a
pleasant
dream
you
and
i
we
have
awaked
it
is
a
new
day
we
wash
the
night
fantasies
off
our
faces
and
are
ready
to
meet
the
morning
with
the
sunshine
in
our
eyes
together
we
have
sipped
the
cream
it
is
time
to
drink
the
milk
we
have
gathered
the
us
look
to
the
kate
said
i
more
kindly
when
did
you
think
all
these
things
for
the
lassie
made
me
marvel
with
the
aptness
of
her
speech
and
ashamed
with
her
plain
saying
of
things
that
i
had
hardly
named
within
myself
ah
she
said
gently
and
wisely
the
thoughts
of
a
lass
when
a
lad
comes
courting
her
are
more
than
she
tells
with
her
mouth
for
many
a
kiss
is
on
the
lips
but
bitter
as
gall
in
the
heart
yet
so
has
it
not
been
with
yours
and
mine
we
loved
and
we
part
even
as
the
of
the
wind
that
kissed
the
apple
blossom
in
the
spring
when
the
year
was
young
and
she
made
to
rise
from
her
seat
i
must
go
she
said
to
go
meet
robert
harburgh
and
to
kiss
him
i
thought
i
knew
his
whistle
said
i
with
my
heart
raging
angry
and
disconsolate
in
spite
of
her
fine
words
which
i
could
not
answer
ay
she
said
rising
and
setting
her
lips
tenderly
to
my
brow
which
i
pettishly
turned
away
being
weakly
sullen
even
meet
robert
harburgh
and
to
kiss
and
with
that
she
passed
to
the
door
she
turned
ere
she
went
out
to
say
a
last
word
and
you
launce
my
lad
will
also
one
day
desire
to
leave
kissing
comfits
and
find
abiding
love
and
you
need
not
go
far
afield
to
look
for
it
thus
i
was
left
alone
with
a
heaving
heart
and
i
am
not
ashamed
to
say
that
i
wept
bitterly
for
poor
launce
kennedy
who
had
none
to
care
for
him
in
all
the
wide
lone
world
in
which
he
was
now
so
sore
wounded
and
cast
aside
like
an
old
shoe
or
a
broken
sword
but
even
as
i
wept
and
pitied
myself
nell
kennedy
danced
in
merry
as
the
morn
and
brought
a
great
spray
of
belated
hawthorn
to
set
in
a
dish
of
water
to
keep
the
room
sweet
and
i
declare
i
never
knew
the
young
lass
look
so
winsome
before
marriage
made
in
when
robert
harburgh
came
in
to
see
me
in
the
evening
i
was
chill
enough
in
my
reception
but
since
he
was
of
a
calm
temper
though
so
great
a
sworder
i
might
just
as
well
have
embraced
him
for
all
the
difference
it
made
to
him
so
i
said
without
giving
him
more
than
time
to
sit
all
my
days
i
must
ever
fly
headlong
at
a
thing
and
have
done
with
so
you
are
going
to
marry
kate
allison
she
was
proposing
so
said
he
as
calmly
as
when
he
had
walked
across
the
yard
to
the
with
the
hackbutt
bullets
splattering
about
him
and
the
guns
going
down
the
hedgerows
like
the
thumbs
of
a
class
of
bairns
when
the
dominie
asks
a
question
so
said
i
and
you
were
thinking
maybe
that
that
was
the
action
of
a
friend
when
your
comrade
was
laid
by
the
heels
i
was
thinking
so
said
he
looking
out
of
the
window
at
the
trees
did
you
not
know
i
cried
for
i
was
angered
beyond
words
being
weak
and
taking
ill
with
the
cherry
being
thus
snatched
out
of
my
mouth
did
you
not
know
that
kate
allison
was
my
lass
before
she
was
yours
did
she
not
tell
you
that
said
i
now
had
i
been
myself
i
should
not
thus
have
told
tales
on
a
lass
even
though
i
believed
with
some
reason
that
she
had
deceived
me
i
was
not
deprived
of
the
sight
of
my
eyes
said
he
very
quietly
and
you
mean
by
said
i
trembling
with
anger
that
i
did
not
need
telling
that
you
had
been
courting
the
lass
off
and
on
for
a
year
or
twa
and
that
she
took
it
not
and
in
spite
of
that
you
made
up
to
kate
allison
when
i
was
lying
sick
unto
death
upon
my
bed
i
asked
him
bitterly
how
long
may
you
have
kenned
kate
allison
said
robert
harburgh
to
me
in
his
turn
six
years
or
so
said
i
and
did
you
ever
in
all
that
time
ask
her
to
marry
you
he
inquired
no
said
i
not
seeing
what
he
was
driving
at
then
said
robert
very
drily
i
did
though
i
kenned
her
not
six
weeks
and
i
would
not
wonder
he
went
on
as
though
deep
in
meditation
i
would
not
wonder
but
that
is
the
reason
why
she
is
going
to
marry
so
i
turned
over
in
bed
being
deep
in
the
sullens
and
robert
harburgh
went
away
saying
only
now
ye
are
angry
launcelot
but
ye
will
find
us
both
good
friends
and
blythe
will
we
be
to
see
you
at
the
lands
of
chitterlintie
which
my
lord
cassillis
is
setting
to
kate
and
however
as
things
fell
out
the
wedding
was
not
to
be
on
the
thursday
nor
yet
for
many
thursdays
for
robert
was
bidden
ride
with
the
earl
to
the
inch
his
new
house
in
galloway
hither
he
went
to
set
pressure
on
the
country
lairds
who
were
his
feudal
holders
to
gar
them
pay
the
dues
which
he
john
thought
had
been
too
long
overlooked
by
his
forebears
as
the
business
was
likely
to
prove
a
troublesome
one
he
sent
for
robert
harburgh
to
ride
with
him
so
without
so
much
as
stopping
to
dismount
for
the
message
came
when
he
had
been
on
duty
robert
harburgh
rode
away
and
if
you
will
believe
it
he
went
without
so
much
as
kissing
his
sweetheart
he
leaned
down
and
shook
hands
with
her
but
as
for
me
i
marvelled
how
she
bore
with
that
for
to
my
certain
knowledge
she
liked
the
other
not
so
just
as
i
was
daily
getting
stronger
i
received
another
shock
which
had
i
think
even
more
effect
on
me
than
the
other
one
morning
there
came
sir
thomas
down
from
the
castle
and
i
could
see
that
he
was
full
to
the
teeth
with
news
for
he
walked
with
great
confidence
and
swung
a
little
stick
made
of
two
twisted
stems
of
ivy
which
i
had
given
him
very
quaint
and
curious
it
is
all
done
with
now
he
said
as
soon
as
ever
he
had
gotten
himself
seated
there
are
to
be
no
more
ill
times
in
carrick
and
kinsmen
s
blood
shall
not
flow
any
more
in
the
west
john
mure
of
auchendrayne
and
i
have
settled
it
all
between
us
his
son
and
apparent
heir
james
is
to
marry
with
my
i
stared
at
him
stunned
and
dumbfounded
ay
he
said
it
is
short
notice
but
young
folks
ye
my
daughter
would
not
hear
of
a
great
wedding
only
what
was
fitting
and
your
daughter
i
said
steadying
myself
though
my
heart
was
like
to
break
for
i
thought
all
my
friends
were
to
leave
me
together
ay
marjorie
said
sir
thomas
she
is
a
quiet
like
lass
and
speaks
little
but
when
i
put
the
matter
of
the
marriage
to
her
she
said
only
if
it
will
staunch
the
feud
i
am
ready
to
marry
whomsoever
you
thomas
tode
gin
you
like
but
that
was
only
her
daffing
for
as
we
all
know
sir
thomas
is
married
already
and
even
if
he
were
not
marrying
him
would
be
neither
here
nor
there
in
the
matter
of
the
cassillis
and
bargany
for
my
good
master
never
saw
far
into
a
whin
bush
all
his
days
though
accounted
by
most
to
be
a
wise
man
on
the
morrow
which
was
the
day
of
the
wedding
i
put
on
my
complete
accoutrements
for
the
first
time
i
had
dom
nicholas
saddled
for
i
felt
strong
once
more
and
greatly
desired
to
be
away
from
the
place
so
i
stood
by
the
gate
as
the
party
from
auchendrayne
came
in
and
saluted
them
as
was
my
duty
then
i
was
riding
away
alone
down
by
the
shore
road
when
i
heard
in
the
distance
the
sound
as
of
an
approaching
cavalcade
bridles
were
jingling
stirrups
clicking
and
spearheads
making
points
of
light
while
the
white
foam
went
blowing
back
from
the
horses
when
they
rode
up
i
saw
that
they
were
as
trenchant
a
set
of
blades
as
ever
a
man
might
wish
to
set
eyes
on
and
at
the
head
of
them
rode
young
gilbert
kennedy
of
bargany
so
not
knowing
whether
they
came
in
peace
or
war
i
set
myself
upright
on
the
back
of
dom
nicholas
who
was
of
so
great
freshness
with
kicking
of
his
heels
in
the
park
that
he
was
ill
to
keep
at
the
stand
nevertheless
stand
i
did
in
the
midst
of
the
outer
gate
so
that
i
should
know
whether
they
came
in
peace
or
war
and
to
have
time
to
cry
to
the
porter
even
if
they
rode
roughshod
over
me
and
though
i
was
weak
and
knew
not
what
might
happen
it
was
a
joy
untellable
to
be
somebody
again
and
to
gar
men
reckon
with
me
but
being
pale
i
fear
i
made
a
poor
figure
to
stand
in
the
gate
and
withhold
so
many
for
during
my
captivity
the
hair
on
my
face
had
begun
to
grow
in
a
manner
that
was
surprising
and
proved
a
constant
trouble
to
me
to
keep
shaven
halt
i
cried
to
them
how
come
you
to
peace
or
boding
in
fear
of
war
but
to
wish
the
tutor
luck
on
his
birthday
in
passing
said
gilbert
and
then
to
ride
on
to
the
help
of
john
earl
of
so
much
astonished
at
what
had
befallen
and
especially
at
his
last
saying
i
fell
in
behind
him
and
the
word
was
given
to
ride
forward
but
bargany
called
me
to
come
beside
him
and
asked
me
of
my
health
i
replied
that
i
had
been
long
time
sick
of
a
wound
but
that
i
was
now
recovered
and
above
all
things
desired
action
being
sicker
far
of
the
doing
of
nothing
whereat
he
laughed
and
said
be
cheerful
and
if
ye
want
blows
i
will
ask
the
loan
of
you
as
a
hostage
from
your
then
seeing
the
stir
about
the
doors
and
the
serving
men
running
every
way
with
flagons
and
dishes
he
said
tis
a
great
stir
for
naught
but
the
tutor
s
birthday
what
may
be
the
occasion
then
with
my
eyes
secretly
upon
his
i
told
gilbert
kennedy
that
the
lady
marjorie
was
to
be
married
that
day
to
james
mure
of
auchendrayne
i
never
saw
a
man
s
countenance
change
so
suddenly
the
fire
sprang
to
his
eyes
and
died
out
again
like
dead
tinder
the
heart
blood
flushed
hot
to
his
face
and
returning
left
him
pale
as
a
maid
in
a
decline
then
i
minded
how
i
had
taken
the
matter
myself
yet
i
was
sorrier
for
him
because
i
knew
that
he
had
loved
her
longer
and
better
than
i
but
nevertheless
he
tossed
his
sword
hand
in
air
and
cried
we
are
in
time
for
a
bridal
brave
lads
this
is
more
than
we
bargained
for
let
us
go
greet
the
bride
and
wish
her
and
this
i
grant
was
a
better
way
than
sulking
and
in
the
greenwood
which
would
have
been
mine
that
day
had
i
been
left
alone
with
that
he
put
the
horses
to
the
gallop
and
we
rode
through
the
narrow
pass
of
the
drawbridge
by
two
and
two
the
roar
of
the
horses
passing
over
was
as
the
roar
of
the
sea
when
the
storm
drives
up
from
the
west
on
the
craigs
of
culzean
as
we
came
by
the
corner
of
the
terrace
i
saw
him
give
a
look
at
that
window
of
the
white
tower
which
faced
to
the
landward
it
had
been
the
lady
marjorie
s
and
now
was
to
be
hers
no
more
then
i
saw
him
look
down
on
the
fretting
sea
as
it
tumbled
white
on
the
pebbles
and
rocks
by
the
cove
and
i
knew
why
he
looked
there
and
i
knew
more
also
for
i
remembered
what
i
had
heard
marjorie
say
after
he
had
gone
clanking
down
the
shore
in
his
anger
and
pride
yet
all
the
while
bargany
rode
upon
his
the
pride
of
his
horsemen
clattering
behind
him
gay
with
the
music
of
hoofs
and
the
dance
of
red
and
white
pennons
i
wondered
not
that
as
they
said
he
took
the
eyes
of
ladies
wherever
he
went
so
that
the
queen
s
quarrelled
concerning
him
till
her
majesty
said
i
shall
have
no
peace
till
i
take
him
for
myself
but
what
would
james
say
if
young
bargany
were
to
sing
john
come
kiss
me
now
beneath
my
bower
window
but
more
than
all
ladies
favours
i
envied
him
such
a
brave
repair
of
horse
to
follow
him
for
culzean
was
too
poor
and
the
lord
of
cassillis
too
near
the
bone
to
keep
any
such
array
of
mounted
gentlemen
for
hackbuttmen
and
footmen
with
spears
were
more
to
our
earl
s
mind
being
better
in
the
time
of
war
and
a
deal
cheaper
in
the
days
of
even
in
these
troubled
years
were
so
many
more
than
the
days
of
fighting
as
we
rode
up
and
the
bargany
squadron
halted
with
a
great
spattering
of
sand
and
tossing
of
the
heads
of
horses
the
wedding
folk
were
just
coming
out
first
of
all
there
issued
forth
the
bride
our
marjorie
the
marjorie
that
had
been
ours
on
james
mure
s
that
now
was
her
husband
and
behind
them
came
the
minister
of
maybole
and
sir
thomas
walking
together
very
caigy
and
jocose
friendly
but
marjorie
s
face
was
like
stone
though
the
bitterness
of
death
overpast
was
gone
from
it
i
trust
mine
eyes
may
never
see
such
a
look
of
reproach
and
pain
in
any
human
face
as
was
in
hers
when
she
saw
gilbert
kennedy
sitting
his
horse
in
front
of
the
squadron
upon
the
gravel
stones
from
the
seashore
that
were
laid
before
the
castle
steps
but
gilbert
only
saluted
her
and
cried
aloud
as
was
customary
luck
to
the
wedding
and
health
to
the
bride
then
ran
sir
thomas
to
him
and
took
his
hand
bubbling
over
with
kindliness
and
pleasure
the
feud
is
staunched
indeed
when
i
see
bargany
once
more
in
peace
at
the
house
of
culzean
even
as
my
good
friend
the
laird
of
auchendrayne
said
it
would
be
what
might
be
your
kindly
errand
and
will
ye
not
light
off
your
beasts
and
bide
to
feast
with
i
can
not
said
bargany
the
earl
of
cassillis
is
besieged
in
the
house
of
inch
by
the
lairds
of
galloway
and
i
ride
to
his
then
she
that
had
been
marjorie
kennedy
turned
to
him
and
said
and
will
ye
indeed
consent
to
staunch
the
feud
for
john
mure
s
sake
that
would
not
do
it
for
mine
which
seemed
to
me
a
strange
mode
of
speech
to
be
spoken
in
the
hearing
of
a
husband
on
his
wedding
day
but
i
had
forgotten
that
none
held
the
key
to
the
utterance
saving
gilbert
kennedy
and
myself
the
staunching
of
the
feud
is
neither
yours
nor
mine
lady
marjorie
said
bargany
bending
very
gently
toward
her
but
i
can
not
bide
still
in
my
house
at
the
town
of
ayr
while
a
kennedy
of
enemy
though
he
dared
outfaced
and
threatened
by
a
pack
of
galloway
are
they
then
ill
men
and
far
in
the
wrong
said
she
on
the
contrary
they
are
good
men
and
in
the
right
but
that
does
not
hinder
me
from
standing
for
my
name
and
house
against
every
other
even
though
that
house
be
foredoomed
to
fall
because
it
is
divided
against
then
he
turned
to
my
master
saying
to
him
for
this
one
time
and
as
a
pledge
to
my
lord
the
earl
john
that
i
mean
his
good
will
you
permit
launcelot
your
esquire
to
ride
in
my
that
hath
so
oft
ridden
well
against
my
folk
gladly
said
sir
thomas
but
the
lad
has
been
it
is
no
far
ride
and
the
boy
needs
but
change
of
air
and
foes
of
mettle
to
strengthen
his
so
in
a
trice
i
was
ready
to
follow
my
house
s
enemy
as
i
turned
i
saw
john
mure
of
auchendrayne
standing
looking
in
the
dignity
of
his
white
hair
most
like
a
saint
though
contrariwise
i
knew
him
to
be
that
which
i
will
not
name
i
heard
him
say
to
my
master
ye
see
did
not
i
tell
you
this
marriage
brings
all
good
things
already
and
this
is
but
the
nay
replied
sir
thomas
indeed
it
is
most
gratifying
and
well
done
of
you
who
would
have
believed
a
week
ago
that
bargany
would
have
saddled
his
steeds
and
mounted
his
men
to
ride
to
the
succour
of
john
earl
of
cassillis
and
i
saw
my
good
simple
master
raise
his
hand
and
clap
auchendrayne
upon
the
shoulder
then
for
very
hate
and
loathing
i
turned
away
even
as
i
did
so
i
saw
the
eye
of
john
mure
on
the
watch
and
i
knew
that
he
understood
for
his
glance
was
like
a
when
your
enemy
means
killing
ere
the
horsemen
turned
to
ride
away
marjorie
came
down
the
steps
to
where
bargany
sat
his
charger
and
slipping
a
ring
off
her
finger
she
handed
it
up
to
him
for
your
isobel
stewart
she
said
and
though
i
saw
it
not
i
am
as
certain
as
if
i
had
seen
the
crest
and
posy
upon
it
that
the
ring
was
his
own
one
which
he
had
given
her
in
some
past
day
when
they
had
far
other
hopes
than
to
part
in
this
fashion
on
her
wedding
morning
then
with
a
quick
cry
of
command
and
the
gallant
clatter
of
hoofs
we
rode
away
and
that
was
the
last
parting
in
life
of
gilbert
and
marjorie
kennedy
who
had
been
lovers
ever
since
they
were
bairns
and
had
linked
themselves
together
for
man
and
wife
with
chains
of
yellow
gowans
upon
the
braes
of
culzean
galloway
as
you
may
suppose
it
was
no
grief
but
the
reverse
for
me
to
ride
away
with
bargany
to
the
south
and
leave
behind
me
the
drear
house
of
culzean
upon
that
dismal
day
of
doom
and
sacrifice
nell
kennedy
i
saw
nothing
of
though
as
i
learned
in
the
aftertime
she
saw
me
for
she
too
had
fled
from
the
house
being
unwilling
to
have
aught
to
do
with
such
a
deed
of
cruel
wrong
as
the
marrying
of
her
sister
that
was
the
flower
of
the
west
to
an
oafish
lout
like
james
mure
not
but
what
our
maidie
can
stand
up
for
herself
and
if
she
gets
not
her
own
way
sorry
am
i
even
for
james
mure
said
she
it
was
from
the
branches
of
a
thick
plane
that
nell
watched
us
ride
away
to
the
house
of
the
inch
and
noted
me
as
i
cantered
by
bargany
s
side
of
which
had
i
known
it
then
i
should
have
been
fain
for
wild
ettercap
as
she
was
i
now
counted
nell
kennedy
almost
the
only
friend
i
had
left
and
as
we
went
bargany
told
me
of
the
earl
s
message
brought
him
by
james
young
the
minister
of
colmonel
and
in
especial
how
he
had
telled
a
great
lie
to
win
through
the
men
of
which
sin
it
was
then
uncommon
for
a
minister
to
be
found
out
not
but
that
my
heart
is
with
the
lads
of
galloway
said
bargany
but
after
all
gibby
is
the
first
of
the
kennedies
and
i
shall
not
see
him
put
down
whatever
be
his
deserts
by
garthland
and
the
sheriff
if
cassillis
is
to
go
down
bargany
shall
go
with
it
and
all
galloway
twice
told
shall
not
accomplish
that
although
i
felt
chilled
by
the
dull
unheartsome
day
we
had
left
behind
us
i
can
tell
you
i
thought
no
little
of
myself
to
be
thus
riding
in
comradeship
with
bargany
at
my
elbow
for
though
i
had
so
ridden
with
the
earl
once
or
twice
yet
i
counted
ten
times
more
on
bargany
forty
horsemen
were
of
our
company
and
mine
was
the
weariest
body
among
them
all
for
it
was
my
first
long
day
after
my
sickness
with
harness
on
my
back
and
pulses
beat
where
my
wounds
had
been
so
that
i
feared
that
they
would
break
out
afresh
and
i
have
to
be
left
behind
at
last
we
stayed
our
steeds
at
a
small
tenant
s
house
called
craigaffie
a
little
way
from
the
inch
where
a
vassal
of
bargany
s
dwelt
him
we
sent
to
meet
the
earl
and
tell
him
that
we
were
to
bid
the
galloway
men
come
to
an
arbitrament
if
so
they
would
for
they
had
enclosed
the
earl
back
and
front
in
his
own
house
of
the
inch
so
that
none
could
indeed
one
that
knew
the
byeways
and
outgates
as
did
this
peter
neilson
of
craigaffie
presently
there
came
back
from
the
earl
a
message
most
piteous
for
he
knew
the
men
of
galloway
had
him
fast
and
he
was
afraid
for
the
safety
of
the
rents
and
mails
that
he
had
with
him
in
silver
and
minted
more
to
do
him
justice
than
he
was
anxious
about
his
own
skin
bargany
was
his
cousin
his
eame
his
saviour
he
would
keep
friendship
with
him
more
than
with
any
friend
he
had
all
the
days
of
his
life
for
this
notable
deliverance
he
had
wrought
he
was
to
come
and
put
himself
in
the
earl
s
hands
after
he
had
sent
the
lords
of
galloway
about
their
business
the
earl
s
plighted
word
would
be
his
security
at
this
bargany
gave
a
smile
and
set
his
thumb
over
his
shoulder
at
the
forty
swords
that
were
riding
behind
him
these
said
he
will
be
the
best
security
that
john
earl
of
cassillis
will
not
harm
me
when
i
go
to
visit
him
in
his
castle
of
the
it
was
no
long
season
before
there
came
macdowall
of
garthland
and
sheriff
agnew
to
represent
the
men
of
galloway
and
never
in
my
life
save
when
i
went
as
herald
to
the
great
house
of
kerse
did
i
see
such
an
exchange
of
high
civilities
it
was
as
the
meeting
of
heroes
when
compared
to
the
and
deceit
of
our
earl
more
than
ever
i
wished
that
i
had
been
born
on
the
other
side
of
the
score
but
it
hadna
bin
to
be
agnew
the
sheriff
was
a
tall
man
with
dark
hair
quickly
frosting
to
grey
a
hawk
s
nose
a
long
arm
good
at
laying
on
and
a
biting
tongue
which
he
knew
well
when
to
hold
the
laird
of
garthland
on
the
other
hand
was
red
of
beard
and
brown
of
hair
altogether
a
man
well
set
beginning
also
to
be
with
good
feeding
and
sleeping
on
benches
of
the
afternoons
it
was
garthland
who
saluted
first
for
he
came
of
the
oldest
race
in
perhaps
it
may
be
the
maccullochs
of
ardwell
but
the
sheriff
was
the
chief
spokesman
greeting
courteously
to
you
bargany
he
said
this
is
a
pleasure
unexpected
over
on
our
poor
the
erne
of
the
hills
neither
mixes
nor
mells
with
the
quarrels
of
the
carrion
i
greet
you
well
sheriff
said
gilbert
kennedy
but
say
your
say
plain
out
without
bringing
all
the
birds
of
the
air
into
the
plainly
then
said
the
sheriff
the
matter
is
this
the
earl
has
moved
the
law
against
us
for
rights
his
father
granted
us
years
agone
rights
that
have
never
been
questioned
and
when
we
will
not
yield
to
him
he
uses
his
influence
with
the
king
to
make
us
traitors
he
sends
his
officers
to
remove
us
from
our
kindly
homesteadings
and
from
the
castles
where
for
centuries
our
forefathers
before
one
stone
of
cassillis
lay
on
the
top
of
and
the
fire
glinted
in
the
sheriff
s
eyes
till
with
his
eagle
s
beak
he
looked
himself
the
very
erne
of
which
he
had
spoken
he
went
on
then
comes
he
himself
with
a
force
of
forty
horse
to
reduce
the
unbroken
baronage
of
galloway
he
summons
us
to
the
court
of
doom
and
lo
we
come
to
this
yett
with
a
hundred
gentlemen
and
as
many
more
footmen
that
but
wait
to
be
called
we
have
obeyed
his
mandate
to
the
letter
whereat
he
sulks
within
gates
then
we
send
him
word
that
we
are
at
the
and
that
we
will
be
most
glad
to
see
his
face
but
for
some
reason
or
other
that
i
can
not
guess
at
he
comes
not
but
withdraws
himself
into
the
house
of
the
inch
where
presently
he
remains
and
we
being
bound
to
see
that
no
ill
befalls
him
within
our
borders
have
set
ourselves
down
to
be
the
warders
and
the
protectors
of
him
and
of
the
so
said
the
sheriff
and
made
his
courteous
amend
and
to
him
bargany
replied
but
lochnaw
ye
know
well
that
ye
have
no
warrant
thus
to
shut
up
the
earl
of
cassillis
immuring
your
lawful
feudal
superior
and
defying
ancient
then
spake
the
laird
of
garthland
if
it
come
to
that
we
are
bound
to
you
and
not
to
the
earl
gilbert
kennedy
ye
are
bound
to
maintain
us
in
our
rights
am
i
to
lose
my
auld
and
kindly
office
and
possession
which
i
have
held
in
direct
line
from
uchtred
lord
of
galloway
of
a
truth
no
bargany
ye
are
of
a
conscience
overtrue
for
work
of
this
kind
ye
will
do
to
me
your
honourable
duty
as
your
predecessors
have
ever
done
to
mine
in
time
and
having
said
his
say
with
dignity
the
red
garthland
held
his
peace
i
could
see
very
well
that
bargany
was
ill
at
ease
he
liked
not
the
errand
he
had
come
on
blows
were
very
well
but
to
be
sat
heavy
on
his
stomach
i
heard
him
mutter
that
i
gilbert
kennedy
should
be
doing
john
of
cassillis
s
dirty
work
for
none
other
sake
than
marjorie
s
would
i
do
this
thing
but
he
took
up
his
parable
with
the
lairds
of
galloway
hearken
garthland
and
as
ye
say
i
am
above
ye
well
do
ye
know
that
the
earl
is
by
law
above
us
he
paused
for
a
moment
as
though
he
had
swallowed
the
bitterest
drugs
of
the
apothecary
and
i
saw
the
sheriff
smile
a
smile
as
bitter
every
whit
hearken
to
me
if
my
lord
continue
to
do
ye
wrong
and
will
not
use
you
kindly
by
mine
honourable
word
in
the
hearing
of
all
these
friends
i
will
not
only
leave
his
will
maintain
you
to
the
last
drop
of
my
blood
but
if
ye
pursue
my
lord
to
take
his
life
seeing
that
he
has
sent
for
me
to
aid
him
i
will
defend
him
to
the
uttermost
of
my
then
said
the
sheriff
bargany
we
are
honourable
men
and
peaceful
we
are
not
here
to
attack
the
earl
but
to
defend
ourselves
in
that
thing
in
which
he
would
do
us
i
will
deal
straightly
with
my
lord
said
bargany
be
content
and
leave
the
outcome
to
we
are
content
they
replied
both
of
them
as
one
we
ken
a
man
when
we
front
him
for
we
ourselves
are
men
we
will
abide
your
judgment
whatever
you
may
so
in
a
trice
bargany
had
gotten
the
earl
to
promise
all
good
things
and
the
galloway
men
were
satisfied
thereafter
they
all
dined
together
with
my
lord
in
the
house
of
inch
and
parted
very
merry
and
the
men
of
galloway
convoyed
us
northward
to
the
braes
of
glenap
where
the
whole
force
and
retinue
of
bargany
s
servants
and
friends
met
us
thus
was
the
earl
released
from
durance
and
his
promises
were
loud
and
many
so
that
we
were
all
and
i
thought
that
the
old
feud
was
at
last
come
to
an
end
slaughter
in
the
but
alas
i
was
never
more
disappointed
shamed
deceived
in
my
life
for
no
sooner
was
our
earl
back
in
his
own
messuages
and
domains
and
behind
his
lines
of
hackbuttmen
than
he
resiled
from
all
his
to
the
galloway
men
who
had
done
so
honourably
in
the
releasing
and
convoying
of
him
and
what
seemed
to
me
worse
also
to
bargany
who
had
pledged
himself
in
honour
to
satisfy
the
sheriff
and
garthland
for
after
all
a
lie
told
to
a
loon
of
galloway
is
not
like
one
to
a
man
s
own
kin
and
country
though
of
course
a
man
that
is
true
all
through
the
web
will
not
tell
a
lie
to
any
but
such
men
are
few
at
least
in
the
shire
of
ayr
where
i
dwell
and
in
edinburgh
to
which
i
have
at
different
times
voyaged
but
bargany
as
was
natural
was
fierce
in
his
indignation
with
the
earl
for
said
he
he
has
made
me
that
am
a
man
of
my
word
break
faith
with
men
of
a
like
pattern
even
with
uchtred
macdowall
of
garthland
and
the
sheriff
of
so
after
all
this
tangled
business
instead
of
peace
as
my
master
had
supposed
when
he
gave
over
his
daughter
to
the
traitors
of
auchendrayne
there
issued
at
the
last
naught
but
feud
more
deadly
and
hateful
than
ever
the
earl
who
to
do
him
justice
was
no
coward
as
to
his
own
skin
went
hither
and
thither
between
cassillis
and
maybole
and
even
south
to
auchneil
riding
freely
as
though
he
had
been
within
his
own
borders
all
the
time
and
the
traps
that
were
laid
for
him
by
auchendrayne
and
thomas
of
drummurchie
the
laird
of
bargany
s
barbarous
brother
were
too
many
to
be
told
yet
for
the
sake
of
the
new
alliance
such
as
it
was
culzean
meddled
not
at
all
with
the
matter
though
doubtless
it
was
a
source
of
infinite
bitterness
of
spirit
to
him
then
all
of
a
sudden
there
came
upon
us
the
eleventh
of
december
which
is
a
day
yet
remembered
in
carrick
because
of
the
many
brave
lads
that
pranked
it
in
pride
in
the
morning
and
who
yet
lay
stiff
in
their
war
gear
or
ever
the
early
winter
gloaming
had
fallen
we
at
culzean
got
our
warning
from
the
earl
s
man
john
dick
on
the
night
before
how
it
was
the
order
that
we
were
to
gather
at
cassillis
yett
and
ride
with
them
back
to
maybole
town
all
in
a
company
john
dick
told
us
but
with
even
more
than
his
customary
surliness
and
unwillingness
that
the
cause
of
this
raising
of
the
clan
was
that
two
days
before
bargany
had
ridden
past
the
gate
of
cassillis
where
the
earl
not
at
all
but
riding
by
with
pennons
flying
in
despite
which
was
held
a
deadly
insult
to
his
feudal
superior
so
earl
john
had
sworn
to
be
equal
with
him
on
his
return
it
was
such
a
day
of
snow
this
eleventh
day
of
december
that
even
in
the
midst
of
the
fight
when
the
hackbutts
were
talking
and
the
steel
ringing
a
man
could
scarce
see
whither
he
was
going
at
times
so
thick
was
the
drift
that
when
a
man
struck
at
an
enemy
with
his
lance
he
could
not
tell
who
it
might
be
that
opposed
him
whether
friend
or
foe
but
when
very
early
in
the
morning
we
rode
out
to
the
muster
the
oncoming
storm
had
not
yet
begun
the
air
was
bitter
cold
blowing
from
the
so
that
it
drove
in
the
faces
of
the
bargany
folk
all
the
day
now
as
of
late
years
it
had
been
customary
with
him
my
lord
of
culzean
was
not
able
to
ride
with
us
for
the
chill
weather
unmanned
him
and
he
could
do
nothing
but
hurkle
over
the
fire
with
a
lad
to
rub
his
swollen
feet
and
stiff
so
it
befell
that
once
more
i
had
the
leading
of
our
good
lads
from
the
sea
border
right
merry
we
were
as
we
rode
forth
for
the
matter
seemed
to
us
no
more
than
a
good
adventure
none
thought
that
the
issue
would
be
so
grim
and
bloody
as
it
proved
we
were
but
to
maybole
when
we
came
suddenly
on
auchendrayne
himself
and
john
dick
the
earl
s
messenger
in
close
i
thought
a
strange
thing
seeing
that
auchendrayne
was
so
great
a
favourer
of
the
bargany
faction
so
soon
as
they
saw
us
come
in
sight
they
parted
and
john
dick
rode
away
over
the
fields
but
auchendrayne
came
towards
us
riding
easily
and
pleasantly
as
if
to
market
a
good
day
to
you
he
cried
whither
away
armed
so
early
we
ride
to
meet
my
lord
and
to
do
his
bidding
i
said
making
my
words
brief
and
curt
because
i
liked
not
the
man
for
all
his
fine
figure
and
commanding
presence
your
master
sir
thomas
is
i
hear
laid
by
with
his
ancient
trouble
i
asked
john
dick
concerning
him
tell
him
that
i
grieve
to
hear
of
without
doubt
you
were
on
your
way
to
visit
him
i
said
with
mockery
in
my
manner
of
speech
for
it
was
a
strange
thing
to
meet
john
mure
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
town
of
maybole
at
daybreak
of
a
winter
s
morning
without
doubt
he
answered
readily
but
now
that
i
know
of
his
weak
state
of
health
i
need
not
trouble
him
this
day
there
is
the
greater
need
laird
auchendrayne
i
made
reply
that
you
should
go
on
and
cheer
him
with
your
pleasant
he
answered
to
that
not
a
word
good
nor
bad
but
turned
his
horse
and
rode
away
to
the
right
making
as
i
guessed
a
detour
to
avoid
my
lord
and
join
our
enemies
of
bargany
it
was
early
in
the
morning
of
this
famous
eleventh
of
december
as
i
have
been
told
that
there
was
a
goodly
stir
and
commotion
in
the
town
of
ayr
gilbert
kennedy
had
resolved
that
he
would
ride
that
day
to
bargany
by
way
of
the
town
of
maybole
sorely
and
often
they
of
his
faction
tried
to
dissuade
him
but
he
was
set
immovably
on
it
as
he
was
on
anything
to
which
he
had
once
made
up
his
mind
think
ye
he
said
that
i
am
feared
of
john
earl
of
cassillis
or
of
all
the
kennedies
of
the
shore
edge
that
ever
scarted
other
folk
s
siller
into
their
wallets
like
ye
needna
be
feared
said
his
brother
thomas
the
wolf
of
drummurchie
but
ye
surely
have
enough
of
sense
to
take
care
of
your
pelt
even
a
swine
has
that
muckle
do
you
think
that
cassillis
and
those
that
are
with
him
have
not
as
much
sense
as
we
they
will
be
standing
by
some
roadside
where
we
have
to
ride
by
and
they
will
have
holes
cutted
out
i
warrant
you
long
or
this
to
shoot
us
in
the
as
we
did
for
earl
johnnie
at
the
limekilns
of
the
but
that
debauched
villain
the
laird
of
benane
and
his
sister
moved
him
to
that
pride
to
which
also
his
own
heart
ever
too
easily
inclined
so
in
spite
of
all
entreaty
bargany
leaped
on
his
charger
and
rode
forward
himself
with
only
ten
or
twelve
horsemen
as
a
first
vanguard
behind
him
there
came
other
seventy
making
in
all
the
number
of
fourscore
armed
men
on
horseback
all
good
riders
of
mettle
some
of
these
were
such
burghers
of
ayr
as
had
a
soul
beyond
the
and
could
follow
a
foray
and
bend
the
pull
of
a
pistolet
with
any
man
for
i
have
learned
that
all
townsfolk
are
not
nidderlings
as
once
i
thought
in
my
hot
youth
and
little
knowledge
now
so
soon
as
they
were
well
mounted
there
were
two
at
bargany
s
muster
who
rode
away
to
warn
my
lord
of
cassillis
by
which
way
bargany
should
come
so
that
he
might
be
in
array
the
traitorous
names
of
them
were
william
cunningham
and
hew
penandgow
against
both
of
whom
auchendrayne
had
warned
gilbert
kennedy
but
bargany
had
taken
no
heed
for
he
said
never
yet
have
i
seen
the
time
when
my
right
arm
could
not
keep
my
head
against
kings
and
earls
let
alone
and
penandgows
nor
like
i
this
day
s
work
said
auchendrayne
for
i
see
not
here
the
weight
of
men
to
do
your
turn
and
carry
you
yet
all
the
time
he
was
plotting
that
gilbert
kennedy
should
no
more
ride
home
to
bargany
and
that
john
mure
should
rule
the
land
in
his
stead
it
was
not
long
before
they
came
to
the
bridge
of
doon
there
they
stayed
awhile
and
bargany
set
his
fighting
men
in
array
and
as
was
the
custom
he
made
an
address
to
which
i
have
heard
much
and
often
for
all
men
minded
it
as
the
speech
of
a
brave
man
sirs
he
said
so
that
they
could
all
catch
his
words
i
am
here
to
protest
before
god
that
i
seek
neither
the
life
nor
the
dishonour
of
my
lord
but
i
desire
only
to
ride
home
to
my
house
in
peace
if
he
will
let
me
but
if
not
i
look
to
you
all
to
do
your
duty
as
becometh
men
he
that
is
willing
to
do
this
out
of
love
and
kindness
for
me
let
him
tarry
with
me
to
the
end
but
if
not
let
him
leave
me
now
at
this
present
and
they
all
answered
we
will
die
in
your
defence
if
any
dire
hurt
or
pursue
you
so
being
well
agreed
they
of
bargany
rode
forward
they
were
divided
into
two
companies
and
their
faces
were
set
toward
the
gate
of
the
town
and
now
it
befits
that
i
speak
of
the
things
which
i
saw
with
my
own
eyes
and
of
the
noble
muster
that
we
of
the
cassillis
faction
made
on
the
knowes
outside
of
maybole
i
mind
well
how
the
earl
s
spies
came
riding
in
with
the
news
that
bargany
had
ridden
out
of
the
town
of
ayr
and
what
joy
was
in
the
hearts
of
most
of
us
that
were
there
when
we
heard
that
with
him
he
had
but
eighty
men
earl
john
was
so
full
of
pleasure
that
his
countenance
shone
and
he
cracked
his
thumbs
like
a
boy
seeing
his
enemy
already
in
his
power
he
rode
here
and
there
among
us
and
saw
to
it
that
all
the
hackbuttmen
had
matches
and
all
the
footmen
practicable
spears
and
pikes
when
we
gathered
in
the
high
street
of
maybole
the
snow
was
just
beginning
to
fall
and
presently
it
came
driving
up
from
the
south
so
that
we
had
it
on
our
backs
all
through
the
fight
i
was
put
in
the
very
forefront
of
the
muster
with
my
twenty
horsemen
for
save
and
excepting
those
of
culzean
and
the
few
that
surrounded
his
own
person
and
were
his
gentlemen
as
robert
harburgh
and
others
my
lord
of
cassillis
counted
not
many
horsemen
but
rather
spent
his
means
upon
providing
hackbuttmen
with
the
latest
species
of
ordnance
nevertheless
gallantly
enough
we
rode
forth
from
maybole
with
the
hackbuttmen
and
spearmen
coming
on
foot
after
us
the
street
was
full
of
them
as
far
as
one
could
discern
through
the
oncoming
storm
rising
and
falling
like
the
waves
of
the
sea
yet
was
our
soldierly
figure
a
little
spoiled
by
the
falling
least
to
the
eyes
of
the
women
that
looked
down
upon
us
in
droves
from
the
upper
windows
of
the
houses
but
of
course
a
soldier
cared
nothing
for
such
a
trifle
when
once
we
got
outside
the
town
my
lord
bade
his
men
line
the
hedges
and
banks
so
that
the
hackbuttmen
might
have
both
rests
for
their
pieces
and
shelter
for
themselves
on
the
other
hand
the
laird
of
bargany
hid
few
hackbuttmen
for
he
said
it
is
not
the
arm
of
a
gen
leman
comes
a
bullet
of
lead
and
be
he
lord
prince
or
peasant
childe
roland
or
base
craven
there
is
no
difference
and
no
no
sooner
were
we
set
all
under
cover
than
our
spearmen
upon
the
left
and
we
upon
the
right
discerned
the
host
of
bargany
beginning
to
crown
the
opposite
knolls
and
through
the
pauses
of
the
storm
i
could
see
the
leaden
glint
of
their
spears
and
hear
the
words
of
command
it
was
indeed
a
picked
day
for
a
grim
fight
to
the
death
at
the
head
of
all
gilbert
kennedy
rode
behind
him
the
wolf
his
brother
and
the
laird
of
auchendrayne
wearing
a
long
cloak
for
it
was
a
stormy
day
and
he
no
longer
a
young
man
like
the
others
then
it
was
that
my
heart
rose
against
the
fighting
and
i
had
no
such
gladness
in
it
as
was
usual
with
me
all
for
the
sake
of
young
bargany
whom
i
loved
yet
as
soon
as
i
set
eyes
upon
john
mure
of
auchendrayne
i
felt
the
iron
grow
in
my
veins
and
the
hot
anger
mount
to
my
head
of
its
own
accord
my
hand
gripped
the
spearhilt
for
this
day
by
the
earl
s
command
i
was
again
to
lay
a
lance
in
rest
but
i
had
now
learned
the
game
and
art
of
it
and
took
lessons
no
longer
from
anyone
if
the
lord
prosper
me
this
day
i
will
make
an
end
of
one
false
rogue
so
i
vowed
solemn
as
if
i
had
been
in
the
kirk
on
a
sabbath
day
then
the
two
forces
drew
so
close
together
that
we
could
see
and
hear
one
is
before
the
snow
swept
down
blotting
out
faces
and
forms
friend
and
foe
alike
immediately
there
began
the
challenging
and
taunting
as
is
ever
the
way
in
these
clan
battles
where
every
fighter
knows
everyone
else
and
has
met
him
at
kirk
and
market
a
score
of
times
then
patrick
rippitt
that
was
ever
a
wild
lad
cried
out
for
provocation
to
the
laird
of
bargany
s
younger
brother
with
whom
he
had
some
quarrel
about
a
lass
laird
of
benane
laird
of
benane
this
is
i
patrick
rippitt
that
took
your
hackbutt
from
you
for
thy
latest
love
s
sake
come
down
to
the
hollow
and
break
a
tree
with
for
that
was
his
manner
of
challenging
his
enemy
to
fight
with
lances
and
again
then
for
all
thy
loves
sake
cried
patrick
which
made
a
laugh
for
benane
s
loves
were
comparable
to
the
snowflakes
for
number
and
eke
for
the
by
no
means
the
whiteness
of
their
characters
for
all
thy
loves
sakes
come
down
and
i
will
gar
thy
harns
clatter
but
benane
was
silent
and
returned
no
answer
albeit
the
moment
before
he
had
been
giving
bargany
counsel
to
ride
forward
at
the
charge
but
benane
was
a
man
debonnair
but
feckless
a
weighty
man
with
his
tongue
but
thewless
and
unable
of
his
hands
long
ere
this
the
men
of
ayr
were
keen
to
be
at
the
shooting
but
bargany
held
them
in
saying
i
will
go
to
the
length
of
my
tether
in
eschewing
all
cummer
and
bickering
so
far
as
i
and
with
that
he
wheeled
about
his
force
off
the
knows
of
the
lady
carse
and
went
down
by
the
bogside
of
dinhame
to
see
whether
a
way
might
be
won
in
that
direction
without
coming
to
the
bloody
arbitrament
of
battle
but
my
lord
the
earl
cried
out
ware
ye
there
on
the
left
they
would
turn
our
flank
and
take
us
at
unawares
so
he
spread
out
his
hackbuttmen
and
made
them
race
down
the
ridges
over
against
bargany
s
men
till
they
won
to
the
foot
of
the
bog
of
dinhame
there
on
the
edge
of
the
moss
was
a
wall
of
turf
or
as
the
country
folk
call
it
a
fail
dyke
so
our
hackbuttmen
coming
to
it
first
lined
it
and
then
began
to
fire
on
bargany
who
was
somewhat
disconcerted
and
taken
aback
at
their
alertness
i
galloped
round
to
the
right
to
make
safe
the
wing
with
my
little
band
of
horse
for
i
feared
we
might
be
suddenly
assaulted
by
the
whole
band
of
eighty
however
as
it
happened
the
sudden
shooting
of
our
musketeers
threw
their
lines
into
confusion
some
of
them
halting
by
a
little
that
was
at
the
this
staying
of
the
charge
gave
further
courage
to
our
musketeers
who
had
full
time
to
plant
their
rests
and
make
their
matches
ready
our
pikemen
also
gathered
at
the
back
of
the
turf
dyke
and
levelled
their
weapons
over
the
heads
of
the
kneeling
hackbuttmen
so
that
it
had
been
as
vain
for
the
whole
company
to
have
charged
upon
us
as
for
them
to
have
attacked
the
walls
of
calais
nevertheless
i
saw
them
muster
again
boldly
and
come
at
us
i
caught
the
trampling
of
their
horses
as
they
gathered
speed
the
fire
of
our
musketeers
flickered
out
here
and
there
adown
the
line
for
it
was
a
dark
afternoon
and
the
flashes
could
clearly
be
seen
i
saw
sundry
horses
go
down
and
heard
men
fall
the
iron
plates
of
their
mail
clashing
on
the
ground
some
of
those
who
started
most
gallantly
reeled
in
their
saddles
threw
up
their
arms
and
fell
backwards
while
their
horses
galloped
riderless
away
for
that
is
the
manner
of
men
s
falling
who
are
smitten
by
the
bullet
as
they
ride
the
wolf
of
drummurchie
was
down
i
hoped
that
he
would
rise
no
more
for
he
was
a
most
cruel
beast
and
the
bane
of
many
lives
indeed
from
before
the
fire
of
our
musketeers
all
trained
marksmen
the
riders
of
bargany
who
had
been
so
proud
fairly
melted
away
thus
was
earl
john
justified
of
his
dependence
upon
powder
and
lead
bids
her
love
i
was
just
rejoicing
that
the
battle
was
well
over
and
that
the
victory
remained
with
us
without
great
shedding
of
blood
when
to
my
infinite
astonishment
i
saw
a
little
dark
cloud
of
five
or
six
men
disengage
them
from
the
deray
and
charge
straight
at
the
thickest
of
us
they
seemed
to
come
suddenly
out
of
the
midst
of
the
battling
snowstorm
for
the
driven
flakes
beat
so
in
their
faces
that
had
it
not
been
shed
from
their
armour
they
would
have
been
fairly
sheeted
white
in
it
as
indeed
were
the
trappings
of
their
horses
in
a
moment
more
they
were
amongst
himself
first
of
all
with
cloncaird
and
james
and
andro
bannatyne
and
behind
them
with
his
sword
bare
auchendrayne
himself
yet
i
opine
he
came
not
willingly
but
that
his
horse
unaccustomed
to
noise
ran
away
with
him
by
what
freak
of
madness
they
resolved
thus
to
charge
as
it
had
been
an
army
in
position
it
is
beyond
me
to
tell
in
a
moment
these
five
were
in
the
midst
of
the
slicing
steel
and
the
flame
of
driving
in
their
eyes
and
their
swords
cutting
a
way
through
the
white
drift
to
reach
the
foe
never
was
there
such
a
least
not
in
this
land
for
there
were
but
five
of
them
to
near
a
hundred
of
us
so
that
i
saw
no
honour
in
the
battle
and
besides
it
went
hard
with
me
to
have
to
smite
that
gilbert
kennedy
at
whose
side
i
had
ridden
so
blithely
all
the
way
to
the
house
of
the
inch
but
i
spurred
dom
nicholas
forward
with
a
kind
of
joy
toward
the
mound
where
auchendrayne
had
managed
to
stay
his
horse
just
outside
the
heady
rush
of
the
fight
i
saw
that
he
meant
to
watch
what
the
end
might
be
but
i
was
determined
that
i
should
give
him
more
than
he
bargained
for
so
i
couched
lance
and
crying
a
kennedy
held
at
him
swinging
a
pistol
as
i
came
and
throwing
it
away
as
i
gripped
the
spear
and
this
time
at
least
i
might
well
have
been
called
spurheel
for
i
rowelled
dom
nicholas
most
vigorously
i
came
upon
john
mure
with
a
surge
so
that
i
clean
overbore
him
with
a
in
the
thigh
i
cared
not
a
jot
that
he
was
old
the
devil
was
older
than
he
and
besides
if
he
wanted
not
to
stand
the
chance
of
battle
he
might
even
have
bided
at
home
for
the
quarrel
was
none
of
his
and
it
had
been
telling
all
of
us
if
i
had
stayed
to
finish
him
when
i
think
of
the
ill
the
man
did
afterwards
and
how
for
years
he
had
been
bringing
many
to
their
deaths
i
can
bite
my
thumb
for
letting
him
off
but
like
a
fool
i
contented
myself
with
the
and
the
chance
pistol
bullet
i
sped
at
him
in
the
heat
of
the
fight
for
i
never
could
abide
the
cruel
slaying
of
the
wounded
which
is
practised
even
more
in
these
private
wars
than
in
the
great
affairs
of
nations
and
this
over
delicacy
has
often
stood
in
the
way
of
my
advantage
so
i
turned
and
left
auchendrayne
lying
on
the
ground
as
i
came
back
i
heard
bargany
crying
out
i
fear
we
are
too
few
but
have
at
them
till
we
die
there
was
but
one
that
fought
with
him
all
his
other
companions
being
stricken
down
and
in
a
trice
he
alone
was
left
on
his
horse
nevertheless
it
was
with
a
light
hand
on
the
rein
and
a
feat
touch
of
the
heel
that
gilbert
kennedy
kept
his
head
though
the
blows
fell
like
hail
on
his
armour
there
were
three
that
he
held
at
arm
s
the
while
crying
out
for
the
earl
and
trying
fiercely
to
break
through
the
spearmen
who
stood
like
a
fence
about
the
person
of
cassillis
where
is
my
lord
himself
he
cried
let
him
now
keep
promise
and
come
out
like
a
man
to
break
a
tree
with
me
so
went
the
fight
of
the
one
against
many
and
such
deeds
of
valiance
saw
i
never
any
man
do
in
this
realm
of
scotland
though
in
my
time
i
have
seen
so
many
brave
and
worthy
things
done
for
gilbert
kennedy
attacked
patrick
rippitt
and
quintain
crawford
with
strokes
that
nearly
dang
them
senseless
crying
at
each
blow
bargany
bargany
to
the
rescue
bargany
but
ever
as
he
raged
through
the
fight
like
a
lion
i
saw
john
dick
watching
him
with
a
poised
lance
in
his
hand
and
while
gilbert
was
at
blows
with
rippitt
and
big
quintain
dick
raised
the
spear
and
sent
it
quivering
at
him
with
an
art
which
i
never
saw
any
man
master
of
save
only
himself
gilbert
kennedy
had
taken
no
note
of
as
i
heard
afterwards
auchendrayne
had
told
all
that
were
in
the
camp
of
bargany
that
john
dick
was
his
man
and
his
paid
intelligencer
in
the
host
of
the
enemy
the
poised
lance
struck
young
bargany
full
in
the
neck
and
stayed
so
in
the
midst
of
his
foes
and
striking
at
them
to
the
last
he
fell
who
was
the
bravest
man
of
his
age
and
at
his
overthrow
there
fell
a
silence
for
a
space
and
the
battle
smother
cleared
only
the
snow
fell
and
scarce
melted
on
the
face
that
was
already
white
and
set
in
death
we
crossed
our
spears
and
made
a
bier
with
our
cloaks
whereon
we
laid
him
then
very
gently
i
drew
away
the
deadly
lance
though
the
wound
bled
not
much
but
inwardly
which
was
worse
we
thought
to
bear
him
to
some
castle
of
his
own
folk
as
it
might
be
to
the
house
of
auchdrayne
but
the
earl
john
came
and
looked
at
his
foe
and
kinsman
as
he
lay
on
the
snow
with
his
eyes
closed
carry
him
to
my
castle
at
the
town
end
of
maybole
said
he
for
that
is
near
now
i
thought
that
not
the
best
place
in
the
world
for
the
young
man
s
recovery
but
being
bidden
it
was
not
mine
to
reply
but
only
to
obey
we
came
to
the
portcullis
gate
of
maybole
and
were
bearing
him
in
upon
our
shoulders
when
down
the
road
to
the
town
there
came
riding
like
the
wind
first
a
lady
and
then
a
man
that
followed
hotly
in
pursuit
when
they
came
nearer
i
saw
that
the
lady
was
she
who
had
been
marjorie
kennedy
and
that
the
man
riding
after
was
her
husband
james
mure
at
sight
of
us
who
bore
the
soldier
s
bier
slowly
on
our
spears
marjorie
leaped
from
her
horse
and
left
it
to
wander
bridle
free
whither
it
would
but
a
page
seized
and
held
it
she
came
swiftly
to
where
we
were
carrying
our
burden
on
the
crossed
lances

gilbert
kennedy
she
said
we
told
her
ay
lay
him
down
under
the
gate
she
commanded
i
would
speak
with
but
my
lady
marjorie
i
said
as
gently
as
i
could
i
fear
that
he
is
dead
then
i
would
even
speak
to
him
dead
she
cried
lay
him
down
her
husband
came
up
to
take
her
by
the
hand
as
if
to
remove
her
but
she
turned
on
him
in
white
anger
swift
and
flaming
you
that
have
never
yet
dared
to
lay
a
hand
on
me
is
it
like
that
you
shall
begin
now
go
look
to
your
father
cravens
that
shun
the
battle
ought
not
to
brawl
with
women
in
the
gate
and
without
further
remonstrance
james
mure
slunk
away
like
the
very
pitiful
rogue
that
he
was
i
could
have
kicked
the
cur
and
wished
there
had
been
fewer
folk
i
had
done
it
too
then
she
that
had
been
so
proud
and
haughty
to
young
bargany
when
he
was
alive
took
the
fair
wounded
head
in
her
arms
crouching
beside
him
in
the
dun
trampled
snow
while
the
flakes
blew
in
upon
her
unbound
hair
she
crooned
and
hushed
him
like
a
bairn
while
we
that
had
borne
him
stood
wide
from
her
some
turning
away
altogether
but
because
i
knew
all
and
loved
her
i
stood
near
gilbert
she
said
noblest
and
dearest
never
doubt
but
that
i
loved
loved
but
you
though
i
flouted
you
oft
and
ever
sent
you
empty
away
yet
i
loved
you
and
none
other
and
i
want
the
world
to
know
that
i
loved
she
said
turning
her
face
up
to
us
all
defiantly
ay
and
loved
him
with
clean
hands
too
for
he
that
is
dead
never
knew
it
but
i
desire
you
that
were
his
enemies
in
life
to
know
that
i
marjorie
kennedy
honoured
myself
by
loving
the
noblest
man
and
the
that
thing
there
who
by
cozenance
bought
me
as
cattle
are
bought
in
the
she
laid
down
his
head
very
gently
taking
a
fine
silken
scarve
soft
and
white
from
her
own
neck
and
in
the
folds
of
that
which
was
yet
warm
with
the
warmth
of
her
pure
and
gracious
bosom
she
wrapped
from
common
sight
the
head
of
him
who
had
died
without
knowledge
of
her
love
then
she
kneeled
low
down
upon
her
knees
clasping
hands
and
holding
the
last
fold
of
the
napkin
ere
she
covered
his
face
from
sight
ah
best
beloved
she
said
very
gently
yet
so
that
i
could
hear
fare
thee
well
so
have
i
never
said
farewell
before
but
ever
scornfully
being
in
fear
of
mine
own
heart
s
treachery
lie
you
there
that
wert
the
noblest
man
the
sun
shone
on
of
adversaries
the
most
fearless
of
enemies
the
most
chivalrous
of
friends
the
truest
of
loves
the
you
there
those
that
hated
you
were
many
but
there
was
one
that
loved
and
loves
you
and
ever
shall
love
you
lie
you
there
heart
that
never
feared
aught
but
god
and
dishonour
and
a
that
never
took
favour
from
man
nor
refused
one
to
woman
see
i
will
touch
your
sweetest
lips
that
never
of
my
own
will
have
i
touched
before
the
earth
be
kind
to
your
body
sweet
the
heavens
receive
your
soul
with
honour
and
the
angels
that
warred
with
satan
and
vanquished
him
stand
up
at
your
entrance
to
give
you
room
she
smoothed
the
cloth
upon
the
face
with
mighty
love
in
the
caressing
of
her
finger
tips
dear
love
she
said
lifting
it
for
the
last
time
and
kissing
his
brow
it
is
sweet
even
thus
in
death
to
tell
thee
that
i
love
thee
then
when
marjorie
had
done
bidding
her
love
farewell
we
lifted
the
crossed
spears
and
setting
them
again
on
the
shoulders
of
men
we
carried
gilbert
of
bargany
away
of
i
ran
back
to
bid
marjorie
return
with
us
to
culzean
where
at
least
we
could
keep
her
safe
she
stood
where
we
had
left
her
looking
at
the
place
where
her
love
had
lain
the
marks
of
the
crossed
spears
and
certain
drops
of
blood
alone
remained
on
the
snow
at
the
sound
of
my
voice
she
started
as
from
a
dream
ah
launcelot
she
said
looking
at
me
strangely
as
though
i
too
had
been
dead
and
in
a
newer
life
had
unexpectedly
confronted
her
do
you
think
that
i
who
fear
not
fifty
in
the
highway
fear
one
or
two
in
the
house
of
auchendrayne
my
work
is
not
done
there
yet
she
added
till
it
be
there
i
shall
and
with
that
she
mounted
and
rode
away
never
did
i
see
a
cavalcade
ride
home
in
such
fashion
after
a
victory
there
was
not
a
man
of
us
from
culzean
but
went
with
his
head
hanging
down
like
a
little
whipped
cur
and
when
we
told
sir
thomas
he
was
like
to
break
his
heart
for
he
was
a
kindly
man
and
had
ever
a
great
affection
for
bargany
and
nell
when
she
heard
it
went
out
and
stopped
the
boys
that
played
at
ball
and
shouted
in
the
also
to
keep
them
sober
she
set
them
to
learn
their
which
in
common
with
all
in
that
country
side
save
perhaps
my
master
they
had
great
need
but
strange
to
tell
after
the
grief
for
bargany
s
death
was
a
little
among
us
there
befell
the
quietest
and
most
gracious
time
that
ever
had
been
in
the
house
of
culzean
it
was
like
the
coming
of
joy
after
the
warm
rain
of
pity
which
thawed
our
hearts
yet
the
things
that
happened
during
these
months
were
many
first
of
all
there
was
the
marrying
of
my
pretty
cruel
kate
to
robert
harburgh
who
had
at
last
gotten
leave
to
depart
from
the
earl
and
the
to
settle
on
so
the
day
came
that
i
had
looked
for
to
be
so
bitter
to
me
and
lo
it
was
not
bitter
at
all
for
i
stood
beside
nell
kennedy
in
white
who
was
kate
allison
s
best
maid
and
it
was
indeed
a
sight
comely
then
it
was
that
for
the
first
time
i
honestly
judged
nell
to
be
more
beautiful
than
her
sister
marjorie
of
which
i
have
often
thought
since
when
all
was
over
and
nell
and
i
had
done
racing
and
throwing
of
old
shoes
after
them
as
they
rode
away
together
to
their
house
of
chitterlintie
it
chanced
that
she
and
i
walked
home
together
we
were
silent
a
long
while
then
said
i
nell
do
you
remember
how
it
was
our
daily
use
to
quarrel
and
so
it
may
be
again
she
said
tossing
her
head
i
wonder
where
the
rope
is
and
the
that
used
to
dangle
from
the
white
tower
she
asked
after
a
moment
they
are
e
en
there
yet
i
said
if
it
be
that
you
desire
to
go
and
see
your
lad
but
be
more
timely
i
pray
you
in
your
homecoming
for
now
you
have
no
excuse
in
the
way
of
then
i
remembered
and
was
shamed
however
nell
paid
no
heed
but
seemed
to
be
thinking
of
something
else
nor
have
you
now
any
excuse
for
going
down
by
to
sandy
the
grieve
s
she
said
giving
me
tit
for
tat
nell
said
i
we
are
very
good
friends
are
we
not
ay
said
she
drily
brawly
do
i
ken
the
reason
of
and
what
may
the
reason
be
i
asked
of
her
just
that
i
am
all
there
is
left
she
said
so
quickly
that
i
declare
the
saying
took
the
wind
from
me
like
a
sudden
blow
where
one
s
breath
bides
nor
do
i
yet
know
the
answer
to
that
for
on
the
surface
of
the
thing
there
was
certainly
some
reason
in
what
she
said
oh
i
am
not
proud
she
went
on
and
you
and
i
are
good
friends
and
good
company
i
am
e
en
content
to
be
mistress
nell
said
i
going
nearer
to
her
and
taking
her
hand
nell
you
and
i
are
now
to
be
more
than
but
she
drew
her
hand
away
with
a
jerk
try
a
new
way
of
it
she
said
i
am
not
taking
mistress
katherine
allison
s
sweet
speeches
so
that
base
little
wretch
kate
allison
had
been
at
the
telling
of
tales
after
this
i
saw
no
better
way
out
of
the
bog
than
to
withdraw
myself
from
her
and
walk
apart
in
that
silent
dignity
which
upon
occasion
i
have
at
my
command
no
launce
she
said
standing
up
with
her
hands
behind
her
and
her
mouth
pouted
you
are
a
good
lad
enough
but
simple
i
knew
that
i
would
send
you
into
the
sulks
that
was
the
reason
i
said
it
if
you
take
me
for
a
sweet
confection
that
melts
in
the
mouth
you
mistake
me
sorely
but
i
made
no
answer
not
indeed
having
any
to
make
and
so
marched
off
by
myself
yet
for
all
nell
s
and
scorning
of
me
i
did
not
grieve
any
more
for
that
minx
kate
for
as
i
was
no
long
time
in
discovering
the
pretty
traitress
had
told
nell
many
of
those
sweet
things
i
had
said
to
her
i
never
imagined
that
girls
told
such
speeches
and
the
one
to
the
other
i
had
aways
believed
that
a
lass
kept
her
own
secrets
and
only
told
other
people
s
it
was
indeed
most
true
what
nell
had
cast
up
to
me
i
was
but
a
simple
lad
the
heartsome
now
i
must
tell
during
this
time
of
sir
thomas
kennedy
he
seemed
altogether
another
man
he
had
ever
indeed
been
kindly
and
generous
forgiving
and
unsuspicious
but
during
these
spring
months
of
the
year
after
bargany
s
death
he
seemed
to
ripen
like
a
winter
apple
when
it
is
laid
by
till
there
was
no
more
sourness
in
him
anywhere
oftentimes
he
would
come
and
cause
me
to
read
to
him
out
of
the
gospels
aforetime
it
had
always
been
from
the
old
testament
which
i
had
ever
thought
the
more
interesting
till
sir
thomas
that
spring
showed
me
other
of
it
making
me
read
through
the
holy
gospels
indeed
to
talk
with
him
and
watch
his
life
was
better
than
any
sermon
i
declare
that
before
i
understood
his
character
and
thought
i
knew
not
that
religion
was
aught
more
than
the
colour
of
a
thing
to
fight
about
like
the
blood
feuds
of
cassillis
and
bargany
concerning
the
wrong
and
right
of
which
not
one
in
a
thousand
knows
anything
and
still
fewer
care
yet
for
all
his
increasing
gentleness
there
was
naught
unmanly
about
my
lord
but
ever
the
bearing
and
speech
of
a
most
courteous
knight
he
had
a
great
love
for
noble
and
sweet
music
and
often
diverted
himself
on
the
viol
upon
which
he
played
most
masterly
the
scurril
jest
indeed
he
would
sharply
reprove
but
his
heart
still
inclined
to
wit
and
mirth
and
his
countenance
was
constantly
cheerful
specially
this
was
so
when
he
and
i
with
nell
and
little
david
rode
south
to
galloway
where
we
were
to
abide
a
long
season
with
sheriff
agnew
for
marget
kennedy
his
eldest
daughter
was
married
to
the
young
laird
the
sheriff
s
son
and
abode
at
the
castle
of
lochnaw
now
in
these
days
the
air
of
galloway
brisk
yet
kindly
suited
my
master
better
than
the
sea
winds
which
were
ever
blowing
about
culzean
and
what
was
more
to
him
than
all
galloway
was
not
so
torn
by
feuds
as
carrick
and
kyle
and
a
man
held
not
his
life
ever
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
as
a
tavern
drawer
does
an
unsteady
cup
which
at
any
moment
may
be
spilled
nevertheless
my
good
master
found
an
infinite
sadness
in
this
that
in
a
wide
realm
of
men
that
are
called
christians
i
launcelot
kennedy
should
have
come
to
the
years
of
manhood
with
no
better
opinion
of
religion
than
that
it
was
the
rag
of
faction
and
this
too
with
ministers
in
mostly
every
parish
with
preachings
and
communings
and
all
the
outer
husk
of
godliness
but
during
this
springtime
sir
thomas
showed
me
quite
other
of
it
but
yet
i
gave
not
in
to
all
his
argument
about
the
kingdom
of
peace
for
i
answered
that
i
was
his
soldier
and
servant
and
that
time
and
again
it
had
been
so
ordered
by
providence
that
fight
i
the
safety
and
honour
of
my
master
and
eke
for
mine
own
this
being
the
sphere
of
life
in
which
my
lot
had
been
cast
i
object
it
not
said
sir
thomas
defence
and
the
appeal
to
arms
are
lawful
but
i
have
lived
many
days
and
i
think
shall
not
live
many
more
yet
never
have
i
seen
the
lasting
success
of
them
that
make
the
appeal
to
the
sword
truly
does
holy
writ
say
that
they
that
flee
to
the
sword
shall
perish
by
the
and
as
we
paced
together
he
read
to
me
much
from
his
little
bible
and
bemoaned
his
sins
and
evil
life
especially
how
that
he
had
been
overtaken
in
the
house
of
sir
thomas
nisbett
on
the
new
year
s
night
of
the
attack
i
wished
that
i
dared
tell
him
that
i
had
arranged
the
matter
with
his
host
for
the
saving
of
his
life
but
i
judged
that
repentance
is
no
bad
thing
for
young
or
old
so
i
e
en
let
him
repent
his
fill
and
bemoan
as
he
would
few
places
more
heartsome
have
i
seen
than
the
tower
of
lochnaw
first
it
stood
near
to
an
inland
loch
where
ducks
squattered
and
splashed
instead
of
being
like
culzean
set
amid
the
thresh
of
winds
and
the
brattle
of
the
sea
then
the
sheriff
and
his
children
were
well
agreed
and
friendly
with
their
neighbours
so
that
it
was
a
proverb
that
the
wolves
and
the
lambs
lay
down
together
in
that
countryside
for
if
you
stirred
an
agnew
you
had
all
the
wolves
of
galloway
on
your
back
but
in
truth
the
agnews
were
somewhat
strange
lambs
though
their
name
bears
that
signification
we
are
called
agnews
because
we
have
so
often
been
fleeced
said
the
sheriff
once
in
his
pleasantry
but
i
told
him
that
was
bad
sense
though
good
in
the
hills
we
shore
not
the
lambs
till
they
had
grown
to
be
sheep
ay
well
said
the
sheriff
twinkling
with
his
eyes
shear
my
son
patrick
there
for
he
is
now
and
has
been
so
silly
as
to
mix
himself
with
the
unruly
folk
of
i
had
indeed
great
pleasure
in
the
house
of
lochnaw
it
is
a
fair
place
with
walls
moats
and
drawbridges
all
proper
for
that
there
be
no
artillery
set
against
it
but
to
my
thinking
the
mounds
might
now
very
well
be
levelled
and
turned
into
walks
and
terraces
as
has
been
done
at
culzean
i
sat
down
daily
with
the
family
at
table
and
was
in
all
respects
as
one
of
them
for
the
sheriff
said
ye
are
not
to
be
strange
with
my
wife
comes
from
within
sight
of
kirrieoch
hill
and
likes
dearly
to
listen
to
the
tongue
of
the
muirland
border
ay
said
my
lady
agnew
for
i
will
not
call
her
the
old
lady
seeing
that
she
had
kept
the
heart
that
was
within
her
young
ay
and
i
have
not
seen
any
folk
to
better
them
on
these
fat
profitable
that
said
the
sheriff
was
what
i
thought
when
i
went
to
the
minnoch
side
for
a
and
very
gallantly
he
lifted
his
wife
s
hand
to
his
lips
like
the
noble
and
courtly
gentleman
he
was
and
to
this
day
the
agnews
have
ever
been
proud
of
their
wives
and
with
reason
hearken
to
these
young
folk
said
lady
agnew
as
the
noise
and
tumult
of
much
laughter
and
daffing
came
up
to
us
hark
to
them
is
it
not
good
to
be
young
and
therefore
it
is
good
to
be
my
lady
of
lochnaw
said
i
for
i
determined
to
show
that
there
were
folk
in
carrick
that
could
be
gallant
as
well
as
galloway
agnews
hoot
culzean
cried
the
lady
agnew
how
have
ye
brought
up
your
squire
that
he
can
not
see
a
woman
but
on
the
instant
he
maun
begin
to
court
her
what
cried
my
master
the
regardless
that
before
her
husband
s
face
too
that
at
least
is
not
a
galloway
fault
at
ony
gate
said
the
sheriff
smiling
for
galloway
ever
behaves
itself
before
folk
and
courts
only
behind
backs
and
slily
by
the
licht
of
the
ye
talk
havers
andrew
said
his
wife
never
did
i
meet
you
behind
backs
all
the
days
of
our
na
said
the
sheriff
but
your
father
honest
man
was
sair
troubled
with
deafness
and
your
mother
was
blind
and
lame
o
a
leg
haud
your
tongue
guidman
have
some
mense
afore
the
young
man
for
he
looks
a
sober
chiel
and
blate
what
should
he
have
to
do
with
lasses
at
his
years
here
nell
kennedy
broke
out
in
peal
on
peal
of
laughter
and
when
they
asked
her
the
reason
it
was
but
at
launcelot
s
face
when
my
lady
praises
him
for
being
blate
he
looks
as
innocent
as
our
grey
cat
grimalkin
when
she
has
eaten
all
the
fish
for
i
wish
that
i
could
dwell
longer
on
these
sweet
peaceful
days
in
galloway
but
the
spring
went
on
apace
and
sir
thomas
was
summoned
back
to
culzean
his
nephew
the
earl
urgently
needed
his
advice
and
wrote
to
him
to
say
so
the
earl
makes
you
many
compliments
said
the
lady
lochnaw
ay
ay
said
culzean
earl
john
was
aye
a
great
spender
with
his
tongue
even
as
was
the
daddy
of
so
we
were
bound
to
ride
away
from
this
kindly
and
merry
house
of
lochnaw
and
much
did
i
desire
to
return
thither
never
once
did
we
speak
of
wars
and
stratagems
while
we
remained
under
that
roof
but
all
of
friendship
of
lusty
daffing
and
of
leasome
love
but
when
we
mounted
i
bade
farewell
to
all
with
a
wae
heart
i
envied
the
sheriff
greatly
for
he
had
a
wife
whom
he
loved
in
age
as
in
youth
and
yet
whom
he
knew
wherein
to
be
the
master
thing
i
take
it
which
makes
home
happier
than
all
besides
i
thought
within
me
that
patrick
his
son
had
set
himself
a
harder
field
to
plough
in
his
marget
yea
already
methought
he
had
let
the
reins
slip
from
his
after
all
is
no
strange
thing
considering
that
she
was
own
sister
to
marjorie
and
nell
kennedy
of
whose
stiff
necks
i
had
oft
had
experience
ere
we
went
the
sheriff
said
a
word
that
amused
us
all
when
i
came
to
be
sheriff
he
said
i
found
my
father
at
the
horn
outlaw
and
rebel
for
refusing
to
pay
teinds
to
cover
the
back
of
a
bishop
s
lady
with
silks
and
satins
and
when
i
die
it
looks
like
that
i
shall
see
my
son
at
the
horn
for
cleading
of
his
wife
according
to
the
degree
of
a
for
young
patrick
agnew
liked
better
than
all
to
be
for
ever
gadding
about
after
the
merchants
of
france
and
the
low
countries
who
knew
his
weakness
so
well
that
they
would
come
from
far
to
sell
him
stuff
for
the
decking
of
his
when
all
was
said
and
done
was
nothing
to
compare
to
nell
or
even
to
marjorie
her
younger
sisters
so
we
departed
almost
to
leave
the
sweet
place
of
lochnaw
and
the
sheriff
rode
with
us
to
the
village
of
long
clarty
street
with
pigs
and
bairns
running
about
it
set
on
the
shore
of
a
fine
loch
here
sir
andrew
and
his
retinue
bade
us
farewell
and
so
turned
them
and
rode
away
back
to
the
homely
steading
of
lochnaw
now
upon
our
homeward
journey
it
was
the
great
good
pleasure
of
the
knight
my
master
that
we
should
ride
up
the
minnoch
glen
to
visit
my
father
and
mother
whom
i
had
not
seen
for
long
sir
thomas
put
it
that
it
would
be
well
that
we
rode
not
directly
by
ardstinchar
and
near
to
bargany
along
the
shore
road
for
the
folk
of
bargany
were
cruelly
set
against
us
nevertheless
i
knew
that
the
real
reason
was
that
he
wished
me
to
see
my
mother
so
we
struck
across
the
moorland
country
of
wigtonshire
to
the
head
of
the
loch
of
cree
which
is
a
vast
wild
swampy
place
where
many
waterfowl
congregate
and
where
duck
and
seagull
build
their
nests
as
we
breasted
the
swelling
moors
we
came
in
sight
of
the
mountains
that
were
dear
to
me
for
i
was
and
loved
that
i
could
have
ridden
on
carolling
like
a
lark
had
i
been
in
any
other
company
but
sir
thomas
and
nell
knew
what
was
in
my
heart
for
as
we
rode
up
minnoch
they
looked
at
each
little
thatched
and
asked
what
it
might
be
was
most
amiable
of
them
for
i
loved
to
tell
over
the
names
though
the
hearing
of
them
could
not
possibly
have
pleasured
nell
or
her
father
when
we
came
to
the
brow
of
the
hill
along
the
side
of
which
runs
the
track
to
the
rowan
tree
i
begged
of
them
that
i
might
ride
a
little
way
in
front
in
order
to
prepare
my
father
and
mother
for
their
reception
really
i
went
because
i
did
not
wish
them
to
see
me
meet
my
mother
for
i
knew
that
i
was
bound
to
weep
but
it
fell
not
out
as
i
had
expected
for
the
dogs
that
were
about
the
farm
came
barking
and
youching
round
the
corner
and
i
saw
the
rough
head
of
our
herd
laddie
looking
out
of
the
barn
then
he
scudded
across
the
yard
like
a
hare
and
anon
there
came
my
mother
forth
with
a
white
hood
upon
her
head
and
girt
about
with
her
as
she
had
been
when
as
a
boy
i
used
to
come
pelting
home
from
the
hills
hungrily
looking
for
a
piece
and
a
slockening
drink
of
milk
so
she
came
own
the
little
loaning
to
meet
me
nearly
running
in
her
eagerness
i
declare
and
there
at
the
i
leaped
down
from
dom
nicholas
and
took
my
mother
about
the
neck
greeting
like
a
great
silly
bairn
but
for
my
life
i
could
not
help
it
yet
i
need
not
have
cared
for
nell
and
sir
thomas
were
admiring
something
on
the
hills
with
their
heads
close
together
and
over
my
shoulder
i
could
hear
him
pointing
out
to
her
the
road
to
straiton
and
the
way
across
the
hills
to
they
observed
not
my
weakness
then
came
sir
thomas
forward
and
i
presented
him
to
my
mother
whereupon
he
greeted
her
by
the
name
of
lady
kirrieoch
for
that
was
a
title
of
courtesy
to
a
laird
s
wife
and
though
kirrieoch
is
but
a
little
place
and
a
wild
uncouth
holding
yet
sir
thomas
walked
by
my
mother
s
side
leading
his
horse
and
talking
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
all
the
while
as
if
she
had
been
the
queen
of
scots
herself
and
as
i
looked
steadfastly
away
towards
the
wind
so
that
they
should
not
see
that
i
had
been
weeping
and
also
to
let
the
air
dry
my
eyes
for
such
weakness
is
ridiculous
in
a
man
nell
came
riding
by
on
her
palfrey
she
cast
a
little
glance
about
her
to
see
that
none
observed
a
look
quick
and
timorous
then
she
leaned
over
and
gave
me
a
light
little
pat
on
the
cheek
with
her
thing
she
never
did
before
but
which
i
liked
very
well
then
came
out
my
father
to
meet
us
at
the
door
and
sir
thomas
took
him
by
the
hand
heartily
you
and
i
laird
he
said
are
not
so
young
as
we
were
at
the
king
s
muster
on
the
boroughmuir
and
when
you
held
the
colours
of
cassillis
even
as
your
son
does
this
no
sir
thomas
said
my
father
brittle
bones
slack
sinew
hair
have
come
to
us
both
since
that
day
when
it
was
my
good
fortune
to
serve
with
you
and
under
ah
kirrieoch
replied
the
tutor
of
cassillis
i
envy
you
here
on
your
high
and
heartsome
muirs
where
the
wild
cats
are
your
greatest
enemies
and
naught
more
dangerous
than
the
erne
ever
stoops
to
it
is
a
gye
hard
struggle
at
times
replied
my
father
with
launcelot
away
and
only
two
old
bodies
left
with
the
serving
ah
bide
a
wee
said
the
tutor
i
have
made
it
my
business
to
see
that
in
a
little
when
the
lad
has
won
his
spurs
you
shall
have
launcelot
back
with
something
worth
while
in
his
pouch
and
a
handle
to
his
name
as
good
as
the
lave
of
i
am
glad
that
you
have
such
good
reports
to
give
of
him
said
my
mother
oh
said
the
tutor
of
cassillis
drolling
i
am
none
so
sure
of
that
he
has
enough
conceit
of
himself
indeed
but
in
his
presence
we
will
not
say
and
then
my
mother
set
the
table
for
us
with
her
own
hands
though
sir
thomas
insisted
that
she
should
not
but
with
all
due
acknowledgment
of
his
courtesy
my
mother
continued
the
work
with
dignity
and
grace
besides
which
i
question
whether
at
the
moment
susan
the
byre
lass
was
dressed
fitting
to
come
into
a
room
where
there
was
the
company
of
great
folk
but
it
was
more
than
pleasant
to
see
nell
rise
to
help
my
mother
to
spread
the
cloth
and
lay
out
the
silver
spoons
we
had
the
best
of
muirland
of
the
sweetest
and
small
toothsomely
fed
on
the
sweet
tender
grasses
that
nestle
among
the
also
we
had
sweet
milk
oaten
cake
of
a
rare
crispness
a
kebbuck
of
rich
cheese
and
butter
as
the
scriptures
say
in
a
lordly
dish
for
the
vessel
was
of
silver
and
had
upon
it
the
ancient
arms
of
the
kennedies
the
tutor
picked
it
up
and
looked
at
it
these
are
the
bearings
of
my
he
exclaimed
much
astonished
yes
said
my
father
and
he
was
also
my
bless
me
cried
the
tutor
of
cassillis
i
knew
not
that
we
were
so
nearly
and
all
through
the
remainder
of
our
stay
he
called
my
father
and
as
for
mistress
nell
there
was
no
end
to
her
merriment
on
the
subject
now
we
shall
fight
more
than
ever
she
said
for
we
kennedies
always
fight
with
our
cousins
and
i
must
find
the
handle
of
the
hayrake
with
which
i
used
to
beat
my
cousin
philip
it
will
serve
excellently
for
drubbing
launcelot
my
new
sweet
coz
at
last
we
rode
away
and
nell
kennedy
kissed
my
mother
lovingly
when
we
bade
farewell
so
that
my
heart
warmed
more
than
ever
to
the
lass
waeheartedly
enough
we
left
the
little
white
housie
behind
us
sitting
blythsome
on
its
brae
above
the
white
stones
of
the
burn
and
in
my
imagination
to
this
very
day
whenever
i
am
away
from
the
minnoch
for
long
rises
a
clear
picture
of
the
as
we
saw
it
that
wide
valley
filled
to
the
brim
with
sunshine
and
the
stir
of
breathing
airs
the
whaups
and
peesweeps
beginning
to
build
and
keeping
up
all
the
time
above
our
heads
a
brave
welter
of
crying
and
the
whistle
of
eddying
wings
i
wonder
not
that
sometimes
you
grow
homesick
said
nell
kennedy
when
you
are
distracted
and
morose
i
shall
now
know
the
so
we
came
in
due
season
to
the
house
of
culzean
and
there
we
found
all
well
with
james
playing
tennis
contentedly
in
the
court
and
sandy
up
at
the
stables
acting
the
big
man
and
giving
his
orders
as
large
as
my
lord
backs
make
braw
it
was
the
morning
of
the
of
may
and
we
were
on
the
morrow
to
take
our
journey
to
the
town
of
edinburgh
i
had
advertisement
the
night
before
that
i
was
to
ride
to
the
town
of
maybole
to
meet
john
mure
of
auchendrayne
and
on
my
master
s
account
to
appoint
a
tryst
with
him
at
the
duppil
not
far
from
the
town
of
ayr
for
my
lord
desired
not
to
pass
through
that
place
knowing
that
many
of
the
faction
of
bargany
abode
there
but
sir
thomas
ever
believed
that
auchendrayne
was
of
those
that
wished
him
well
because
of
the
marriage
and
of
all
that
had
passed
between
them
so
i
had
to
ride
on
this
mission
that
i
loved
not
over
well
but
i
had
nought
to
say
for
whenever
i
spake
to
the
tutor
concerning
john
mure
he
would
clap
me
on
the
head
and
say
ye
are
overcareful
and
suspicious
launcelot
john
mure
and
i
are
fathers
of
the
same
pair
of
bairns
wherefore
then
should
we
not
be
as
as
they
poor
could
not
find
it
in
my
heart
to
tell
him
of
the
happening
beneath
the
of
maybole
when
james
mure
s
wife
bade
farewell
to
gilbert
kennedy
of
bargany
as
he
lay
there
dead
on
his
enemies
spears
so
at
early
morning
i
rode
as
i
was
bidden
to
maybole
to
meet
the
laird
of
auchendrayne
who
as
my
master
knew
had
some
business
there
but
it
so
fell
out
that
i
missed
him
for
he
had
lodged
all
night
in
the
town
at
the
black
house
which
belongs
to
one
kennedy
of
knockdone
a
friend
of
his
and
of
the
laird
of
newark
s
i
was
loath
to
ride
all
the
way
after
him
to
auchendrayne
and
so
bethought
me
that
i
should
get
the
loan
of
a
laddie
from
my
crony
dominie
mure
out
of
his
school
at
the
foot
of
the
kirkwynd
my
way
led
me
by
the
green
where
it
was
sorely
in
my
mind
to
try
a
stroke
of
the
ball
but
i
remembered
me
that
sir
thomas
bade
me
be
soon
back
that
i
might
be
ready
to
ride
with
him
on
the
morrow
s
morn
to
the
town
of
edinburgh
by
duppil
and
the
ford
of
holmestone
so
though
i
saw
some
brisk
birkies
licking
at
the
ball
one
of
them
being
jamie
crawford
that
had
his
nose
flattened
with
the
stroke
of
a
golf
ball
on
the
hills
of
ayr
i
refrained
me
for
that
time
and
went
to
seek
a
boy
but
i
saw
none
on
the
green
saving
some
raggedy
loons
playing
whom
i
did
not
like
to
trust
with
so
important
a
message
i
went
on
therefore
to
the
schoolhouse
and
as
i
went
it
cheered
me
to
think
on
dominie
mure
and
his
humours
for
he
and
i
had
been
gossips
of
a
long
season
the
schoolhouse
of
maybole
was
a
curious
building
tacked
on
to
the
rear
of
the
kirk
with
vaulted
passages
of
timber
in
which
were
doors
which
could
on
occasion
be
opened
so
that
the
school
itself
might
be
used
as
an
addition
to
the
kirk
should
the
latter
be
crowded
but
in
my
time
the
space
was
but
seldom
in
demand
it
was
an
age
of
iron
and
men
s
minds
craved
not
naturally
that
which
was
peaceable
and
good
the
old
papistry
had
passed
away
but
the
new
religion
had
not
yet
grown
into
the
hearts
of
the
people
i
came
to
the
schoolhouse
door
the
noise
of
conning
lessons
that
used
to
go
humming
all
along
the
kirk
vennel
was
louder
than
it
was
wont
to
be
indeed
i
thought
that
of
a
surety
dominie
mure
had
gone
as
far
as
the
for
his
morning
glass
of
strong
waters
wherein
i
did
that
worthy
man
an
injury
the
dominie
s
highland
pipes
lay
on
the
desk
before
him
the
great
drones
looking
out
like
eyes
at
the
scholars
they
were
the
recreation
of
his
leisure
for
he
had
been
in
his
youth
in
the
savage
north
and
had
learned
to
be
no
performer
even
in
the
country
of
pipes
and
pibrochs
i
looked
within
and
there
mounted
upon
two
desks
and
a
chair
stood
the
dominie
with
his
head
through
a
round
hole
in
the
boards
of
the
roof
and
all
that
one
could
see
of
him
convulsed
with
animation
the
bairns
below
were
in
a
great
consternation
crying
out
that
this
one
and
that
other
was
robin
gibb
was
pinching
or
that
towhead
kennedy
was
in
the
act
of
some
piece
of
villainy
which
remained
unexpressed
for
the
obvious
reason
that
the
heavy
hand
of
towhead
kennedy
had
prisoned
the
information
within
the
mouth
of
the
the
school
of
maybole
was
an
apartment
nearly
square
with
a
dark
oaken
running
round
two
sides
of
it
and
benches
set
on
the
floor
where
when
the
peace
was
undisturbed
by
internal
war
the
bairns
conned
their
tasks
from
worn
copies
of
the
bible
at
the
far
end
of
the
school
was
a
wooden
bar
a
foot
from
the
floor
and
a
little
behind
it
another
this
was
called
the
hangman
for
it
was
the
post
of
judgment
to
unruly
boys
who
were
called
upon
to
kneel
over
the
first
bar
and
grasp
the
second
thus
putting
themselves
into
a
proper
position
for
the
operations
of
the
fiery
and
untender
little
dominie
the
desk
of
the
master
had
a
framework
behind
it
in
which
were
birch
rods
carefully
kept
and
oiled
even
as
i
keep
my
stands
of
arms
the
callants
of
maybole
have
ever
been
unruly
and
so
remain
to
this
day
dominie
mure
was
in
stature
the
least
but
in
learning
i
can
well
believe
the
greatest
of
dominies
for
he
was
never
without
two
or
three
scholars
in
the
latin
it
was
whispered
by
the
malicious
that
he
had
been
trained
for
a
clerk
in
the
old
days
of
the
roman
church
but
made
a
false
step
and
so
had
to
turn
dominie
taking
the
words
at
their
usual
meaning
i
utterly
condemn
and
reject
this
lying
malicious
explanation
for
dominie
mure
was
the
least
handsome
man
in
carrick
he
was
little
scarce
bigger
than
many
boys
of
twelve
and
fourteen
who
sat
in
his
class
in
the
new
was
naturally
the
class
beneath
the
old
testament
his
hair
grew
all
over
his
head
and
face
grey
wiry
and
rough
like
burned
heather
out
of
this
tangle
a
pair
of
humorsome
eyes
looked
and
a
stout
nose
projected
like
the
angle
of
an
overgrown
and
ruined
building
his
arms
were
long
and
so
strong
that
he
could
lift
any
lad
in
the
school
into
the
air
with
one
of
them
while
he
gave
him
paikie
with
the
other
so
fierce
and
fiery
was
the
little
man
that
no
one
of
the
great
stalwart
loons
who
came
in
the
dared
to
try
their
pranks
upon
him
he
would
fly
at
them
swift
as
the
wild
cat
springs
and
beat
black
and
blue
before
they
had
time
to
rally
what
he
was
now
doing
with
his
head
through
the
ceiling
i
could
not
well
imagine
but
there
was
a
great
noise
aloft
and
a
rushing
of
feet
while
the
master
made
desperate
dives
hither
and
thither
like
a
man
in
deep
water
and
not
well
able
to
swim
beneath
one
little
rascal
of
a
loon
rose
from
the
seat
where
he
had
been
sitting
squirming
at
his
copy
the
dominie
is
lost
he
cried
in
great
pretended
alarm
oh
sirs
where
is
our
dominie
look
in
the
lassies
look
in
a
your
pouches
laddies
and
so
all
the
vagabonds
rose
and
began
to
search
the
the
dinner
wallets
and
even
in
the
rat
holes
for
the
master
but
at
this
moment
there
was
a
crash
and
first
one
and
then
another
pair
of
legs
appeared
dangling
through
the
ceiling
wildly
kicking
the
head
of
the
dominie
returned
through
the
hole
in
the
ceiling
and
he
cautiously
descended
his
face
was
damp
with
perspiration
from
his
exertions
aloft
and
he
had
his
longest
and
stoutest
birch
rod
which
was
of
the
thickness
of
one
s
forefinger
in
his
hand
there
was
a
great
streak
of
soot
across
his
indeed
was
about
all
that
there
was
for
it
to
cross
the
rest
of
his
face
being
but
a
grey
tangle
of
hair
dominie
mure
came
forward
to
where
i
stood
by
the
door
he
greeted
me
right
heartily
and
not
the
less
when
i
told
him
on
whose
account
i
was
there
for
he
had
often
been
summoned
over
to
drink
a
pint
with
sir
thomas
at
the
inn
or
in
his
own
town
house
because
my
master
ever
loved
all
learned
men
bide
a
wee
he
said
till
i
attend
to
these
rascal
loons
they
climbed
up
through
the
hole
in
the
ceiling
when
i
was
at
deacon
gilroy
s
funeral
to
get
the
store
of
balls
chuckie
stones
and
other
things
the
bairns
throw
up
there
i
kenned
well
they
would
fall
so
the
dominie
took
a
much
thinner
and
suppler
bundle
of
birch
gave
it
a
draw
through
his
hand
and
a
swish
or
two
in
the
air
which
made
the
dangling
legs
kick
more
wildly
than
might
be
with
pleasure
and
it
might
be
with
painful
anticipation
dominie
mure
walked
to
the
place
and
set
a
chair
for
himself
to
stand
upon
wha
belangs
thae
legs
he
asked
of
the
scholars
they
are
tammy
nisbett
s
said
the
school
with
one
voice
we
ken
by
his
duddy
breeks
and
whose
limbs
are
whom
do
these
legs
belong
he
continued
pointing
to
certain
red
objects
that
twinkled
in
frantic
endeavours
to
be
free
jock
harrison
s
answered
the
school
without
a
moment
s
hesitation
they
are
clouted
wi
his
mither
s
auld
petticoat
then
the
master
did
his
office
affectionately
upon
those
parts
of
tommy
nisbett
and
jock
harrison
which
of
their
own
accord
the
adventurous
loons
had
exposed
the
thwacks
resounded
through
the
school
but
the
yells
mostly
ascended
through
the
roof
then
when
he
had
finished
his
i
saw
by
his
eye
it
was
no
unwelcome
put
up
an
arm
and
without
circumspection
pulled
the
squirming
urchins
through
the
rotten
boards
thomas
nisbett
he
said
severely
your
faither
is
an
householder
he
shall
pay
for
the
damage
done
to
the
ceiling
of
this
schule
which
is
the
property
of
the
session
of
the
parish
of
which
i
am
clerk
and
your
faither
can
take
the
price
out
of
your
breeks
himsel
at
his
he
then
hauled
the
other
down
in
the
same
manner
jock
harrison
i
ll
never
trouble
your
puir
mither
about
the
siller
for
the
repairs
she
has
enough
to
do
with
ten
like
you
but
i
ll
e
en
pay
your
hurdies
the
noo
and
quit
your
mother
and
you
too
at
the
one
which
having
done
he
laid
down
his
bundle
of
rods
dusted
his
hands
and
commended
himself
to
me
to
know
how
and
in
what
manner
he
might
serve
my
master
i
told
him
that
if
he
would
write
a
letter
to
john
mure
of
auchendrayne
to
bid
him
meet
with
sir
thomas
at
the
chapel
of
st
leonard
s
by
the
sandhills
of
ayr
on
the
morrow
s
morn
at
ten
of
the
clock
and
send
it
to
auchendrayne
by
one
of
his
most
trustworthy
lads
it
would
be
no
small
obligation
and
furthermore
that
i
would
await
an
answer
here
in
maybole
having
other
business
to
transact
good
faith
master
launcelot
i
will
do
gladsomely
said
the
little
dominie
so
having
brought
the
school
to
order
and
set
the
classes
to
their
work
he
squared
himself
at
his
desk
and
wrote
fairly
and
elaborately
as
i
told
him
for
the
little
man
prided
himself
on
his
indeed
sir
thomas
ever
said
was
better
than
that
of
any
law
scrivener
in
edinburgh
i
reminded
him
of
this
and
dominie
mure
could
hardly
contain
himself
for
pride
how
strange
that
so
small
a
thing
should
set
up
some
men
then
when
he
had
finished
and
addressed
it
in
the
italian
manner
he
called
out
william
dalrymple
come
hither
and
from
the
ranks
of
the
older
scholars
at
the
a
ruddy
boy
arose
this
the
dominie
said
is
the
son
of
a
widow
woman
and
a
steady
lad
that
will
truly
do
your
message
and
bring
you
word
again
without
delay
or
falsehood
he
is
called
for
a
nickname
willie
so
to
william
was
delivered
the
letter
and
sundry
copper
coins
for
running
the
errand
whereupon
he
took
up
the
vennel
and
through
the
high
street
on
the
way
to
auchendrayne
like
a
hunted
hare
for
as
his
name
imports
he
was
wonderfully
nimble
of
his
feet
having
thus
delivered
my
message
i
thanked
the
dominie
very
heartily
and
went
to
the
play
of
the
golf
green
till
the
messenger
should
return
i
had
an
excellent
game
but
not
playing
with
mine
own
clubs
i
was
beaten
though
not
at
a
great
odds
by
the
young
laird
of
gremmat
whose
chin
was
hardly
yet
better
of
the
cleaving
it
got
on
the
fatal
day
at
the
lady
s
carse
but
this
interfered
naught
with
his
putting
now
gaming
on
the
green
is
uncommonly
fretting
to
the
temper
and
more
especially
when
you
are
losing
with
a
man
like
gremmat
who
cries
and
shouts
at
every
good
stroke
of
his
own
and
dispraises
yours
yet
owing
to
the
equality
of
my
temper
and
also
because
he
was
not
yet
fully
recovered
of
his
wound
i
did
not
clout
him
over
the
sconse
with
my
cleek
as
i
certainly
was
in
a
great
mind
more
than
once
to
do
we
were
yet
hard
at
it
and
the
afternoon
wearing
on
apace
when
i
saw
the
little
dominie
coming
toward
us
with
the
boy
william
dalrymple
by
his
side
the
schoolmaster
held
the
letter
in
his
hand
and
gave
it
back
to
me
william
dalrymple
says
that
he
found
not
the
laird
of
auchendrayne
in
his
own
house
and
has
therefore
brought
back
the
i
looked
at
it
a
moment
turning
it
over
in
my
hand
it
has
been
opened
said
i
see
the
wax
is
gone
and
there
are
so
indeed
it
has
said
dominie
mure
boy
if
you
have
opened
it
i
will
tan
you
alive
outside
and
whereat
the
boy
began
to
weep
i
have
said
what
i
was
told
to
say
he
cried
and
for
all
we
could
do
nothing
more
could
we
get
out
of
that
a
dark
man
faced
like
an
ape
or
a
wild
beast
had
come
some
way
home
behind
him
and
sorely
terrified
him
so
we
sent
the
boy
back
to
his
mother
and
bidding
farewell
for
that
time
to
the
dominie
and
to
young
gremmat
i
fared
along
the
way
to
culzean
to
make
me
ready
for
the
long
journey
of
the
morrow
murder
among
the
it
was
broad
day
and
a
pleasant
may
morn
when
my
master
and
i
said
our
farewells
at
the
gate
of
culzean
with
my
own
hands
i
had
saddled
for
sir
thomas
his
warhorse
but
he
coming
down
arrayed
in
his
plain
suit
of
dark
flemish
cloth
bade
me
take
him
back
to
the
stable
and
get
instead
a
pacing
palfrey
which
he
loved
because
marjorie
had
used
to
ride
it
then
he
kissed
his
bairns
for
the
lads
and
nell
stood
by
the
door
on
the
landward
side
watching
us
with
earnest
eyes
keep
the
castle
james
he
cried
till
i
come
back
ay
said
sandy
we
will
keep
it
for
you
for
sandy
came
ever
to
the
forefront
setting
himself
naturally
before
the
slow
and
quiet
jamie
then
nell
came
near
and
kissed
her
rather
but
she
and
i
only
looked
the
one
at
the
other
as
friends
look
for
at
least
before
folk
we
did
not
so
much
as
touch
hands
so
down
through
the
woods
sir
thomas
and
i
went
sedately
and
quietly
now
into
little
caller
blinks
of
morning
sunshine
which
glinted
straight
and
level
between
the
trees
and
anon
coming
out
upon
a
bare
knoll
as
into
a
room
with
a
removed
and
spacious
ceiling
for
there
at
our
feet
was
the
plain
of
the
sea
sparkling
and
blue
beyond
it
again
the
hills
of
arran
and
to
the
south
the
shoulder
of
the
craig
of
ailsa
heaving
its
bulk
skyward
like
a
monster
of
the
ocean
stranded
in
the
shoreward
shallows
very
pleasant
was
my
master
s
discourse
as
we
went
of
the
wonderful
peace
that
he
was
going
to
bring
upon
the
land
of
carrick
from
his
dealings
with
the
king
and
council
in
edinburgh
specially
he
spoke
with
thankfulness
of
the
present
friendship
of
auchendrayne
of
the
young
bargany
who
should
for
long
be
under
tutors
and
governors
and
of
our
own
earl
now
tired
of
the
feud
and
eager
for
a
lasting
peace
it
needs
said
he
but
that
one
should
take
on
him
all
the
burden
and
heat
of
the
day
and
carry
the
matter
through
and
i
that
am
no
warrior
but
a
quiet
man
dwelling
in
mine
own
house
and
fit
only
for
daunering
about
mine
own
fields
may
be
able
to
do
more
in
the
matter
than
many
battalions
for
i
have
some
influence
with
the
man
that
loves
grave
discourse
upon
so
pleasantly
talking
together
in
this
fashion
speaking
ever
the
kindliest
things
of
the
enemies
of
his
house
and
all
the
time
making
many
excuses
for
them
sir
thomas
kept
his
palfrey
at
the
amble
presently
we
came
to
the
castle
of
greenan
which
stands
on
a
sea
crag
and
looks
right
bravely
over
the
bay
of
ayr
and
down
upon
the
little
town
thereof
it
belongs
to
kennedy
of
balterson
a
gossip
and
of
culzean
s
now
said
my
master
i
must
see
if
balterson
is
at
home
i
think
truly
that
he
is
for
there
is
a
reek
coming
up
very
freely
from
the
lum
now
john
was
ever
a
big
eater
and
a
long
lier
abed
in
the
mornings
what
a
pleasantry
if
i
should
raise
him
from
between
the
blankets
it
would
be
a
great
all
the
days
of
his
so
we
lighted
down
in
front
of
the
castle
yett
i
tied
the
horses
together
and
walked
about
the
cliff
edge
looking
out
to
sea
and
over
the
sands
of
ayr
thinking
of
many
things
mostly
my
thoughts
ran
on
the
treasure
of
kelwood
and
whether
i
should
ever
win
it
of
nell
too
and
what
she
meant
by
patting
me
on
the
cheek
when
we
met
my
mother
of
the
tutor
s
words
to
my
father
that
one
day
i
should
have
a
handle
to
my
name
and
a
as
good
as
any
plenty
of
pleasant
things
i
had
to
think
about
that
caller
morn
in
may
as
indeed
a
young
man
of
spirit
ought
to
have
and
it
was
not
very
long
before
sir
thomas
came
forth
arm
in
arm
with
john
kennedy
of
balterson
a
grave
and
portentous
man
of
heavy
figure
richly
arrayed
more
like
the
provost
of
a
town
than
a
country
laird
and
these
two
paced
up
and
down
the
narrow
terrace
walk
of
greenan
castle
turning
and
returning
wheeling
and
countering
as
on
the
quarterdeck
of
a
ship
but
of
the
matter
of
their
discourse
i
know
nothing
though
i
guessed
it
to
have
been
concerning
the
making
up
of
peace
between
the
feudal
enemies
in
the
lands
of
carrick
and
kyle
it
was
near
to
ten
of
the
clock
and
already
close
upon
the
time
which
had
been
appointed
for
the
tryst
with
auchendrayne
that
we
mounted
at
the
yett
of
greenan
to
ride
on
our
way
to
holmestone
ford
sorry
am
i
said
my
master
that
i
have
not
spoken
a
word
with
john
mure
ere
i
go
but
i
know
his
loving
desire
for
my
success
and
he
well
knows
my
affection
for
we
rode
down
from
the
castle
crag
of
greenan
and
presently
came
out
upon
the
links
these
are
here
all
sandy
cast
up
into
rounded
mounds
and
hills
and
bitten
into
by
the
little
pits
and
dungeons
called
of
them
that
play
at
the
golf
launcelot
ride
a
little
way
in
front
it
approaches
the
hour
of
noon
and
i
would
do
my
devotion
and
meditate
a
little
alone
said
sir
thomas
to
me
so
i
drew
myself
a
bowshot
before
him
riding
upon
dom
nicholas
and
taking
my
hat
in
my
hand
i
rode
easily
enjoying
the
sea
breeze
that
cooled
my
brow
and
tossed
my
hair
i
wondered
if
ever
the
time
would
come
when
i
also
should
be
thinking
about
my
religion
at
noon
of
a
fine
heartsome
day
it
seemed
a
strange
time
enough
for
a
hale
gentleman
to
set
to
his
prayers
presently
i
saw
a
man
standing
upon
my
right
hand
somewhat
above
me
upon
the
crown
of
a
sandhill
and
he
raised
his
hand
as
one
that
cried
to
clear
the
course
in
the
game
so
i
thought
no
more
of
the
matter
but
i
looked
round
thinking
perchance
that
he
cried
to
my
master
who
was
riding
with
bared
head
and
holding
his
little
red
testament
in
his
hand
suddenly
even
as
i
looked
at
him
i
heard
the
sound
of
shots
behind
me
and
turning
dom
nicholas
i
saw
my
master
reel
in
his
saddle
with
white
blowing
puffs
of
gunpowder
rising
all
about
him
from
behind
the
desolate
sandhills
among
which
the
murderers
had
hidden
themselves
drawing
my
sword
i
set
spurs
to
the
sides
of
dom
nicholas
and
galloped
towards
them
i
was
aware
as
i
rode
of
my
master
lying
on
his
back
on
the
sand
and
his
palfrey
galloping
away
with
streaming
mane
a
little
black
crowd
of
men
stood
and
knelt
about
him
and
i
saw
the
flash
of
steel
again
and
again
as
one
and
another
of
them
lifted
a
knife
and
struck
i
yelled
aloud
to
them
in
my
agony
and
bade
them
wait
till
i
came
so
they
hasted
to
make
front
against
me
some
of
them
leaping
on
their
horses
and
others
biding
a
moment
to
put
as
it
had
been
booty
into
their
saddle
wallets
it
was
thomas
kennedy
called
the
wolf
of
drummurchie
that
withstood
me
as
i
came
thus
furiously
upon
dom
nicholas
with
him
i
first
crossed
swords
while
one
james
mure
of
auchendrayne
held
off
a
little
warily
watching
to
win
in
at
me
when
i
should
give
him
opportunity
with
the
corner
of
my
eye
i
saw
the
same
man
whom
i
had
at
first
observed
making
the
warning
signal
he
held
up
his
hand
as
before
then
he
leaped
on
a
horse
which
he
had
by
him
in
a
hollow
of
the
sands
he
was
as
i
noted
a
tall
man
with
a
hat
pulled
low
over
his
eyes
and
he
wore
about
him
the
long
grey
cloak
which
had
been
so
fatal
a
sign
to
us
of
cassillis
but
ere
i
could
see
more
i
was
in
the
thick
of
the
murderers
with
my
sword
i
struck
and
warded
not
knowing
what
i
did
but
only
striking
with
the
anger
of
blood
in
my
eye
till
i
gave
drummurchie
a
cut
on
the
shoulder
which
made
him
fain
to
shift
his
sword
arm
then
i
wheeled
and
attacked
cloncaird
as
furiously
who
was
a
great
mountain
of
a
fellow
red
of
face
and
brutal
of
heart
and
i
had
readily
enough
done
for
him
too
had
he
been
alone
for
he
was
no
man
of
his
weapons
but
i
could
see
plainly
enough
three
or
four
others
charging
pistols
and
training
of
hackbutts
making
ready
to
take
an
aim
at
me
whereupon
i
knew
that
there
was
no
use
of
spending
my
life
for
naught
so
with
my
sword
red
in
my
hand
i
rode
over
the
sandhills
straight
at
the
tall
man
in
the
grey
cloak
but
such
was
the
effect
of
an
ill
conscience
that
he
took
his
mantle
about
his
mouth
as
one
that
fears
being
known
and
set
spurs
to
his
horse
i
had
not
pursued
far
when
i
came
to
the
top
of
a
dune
and
saw
a
little
cloud
of
citizens
that
played
at
the
clubs
beneath
me
to
them
i
rode
as
hard
as
i
could
with
the
murderers
bullets
splattering
here
and
there
and
throwing
up
little
spirts
of
sand
about
me
murder
foul
murder
i
cried
come
hastily
for
the
tutor
of
cassillis
is
done
to
death
one
of
the
citizens
held
up
his
hand
to
me
as
if
to
bid
me
be
silent
for
it
was
the
putting
stroke
which
his
neighbour
played
and
of
its
kind
difficult
so
that
men
held
their
breath
but
when
it
was
made
and
the
ball
holed
they
ran
to
me
quickly
enough
for
alas
murder
was
so
common
in
those
days
that
men
took
little
notice
unless
he
that
fell
was
one
who
was
some
kin
to
themselves
nevertheless
they
hasted
when
i
cried
who
was
my
master
and
who
were
the
villains
that
beset
him
for
the
players
were
all
burghers
of
ayr
and
feared
that
they
should
underlie
the
angers
of
the
earl
and
of
the
king
if
they
gave
not
ready
help
when
this
slaughter
was
done
as
it
were
at
their
very
gates
thus
very
quickly
we
came
to
my
dear
master
he
was
lying
alone
on
his
back
quietly
gazing
up
to
the
sky
the
red
blood
welling
from
many
ghastly
wounds
all
his
rich
plain
flanders
cleading
was
torn
and
disarranged
by
the
villains
who
had
not
disdained
to
despoil
after
that
they
had
murdered
him
yet
there
was
some
life
left
in
him
and
he
turned
his
head
smiling
as
if
thankful
after
the
hateful
faces
of
his
cruel
enemies
to
gaze
at
the
last
upon
the
countenances
of
friends
he
was
as
i
thought
past
speech
but
he
looked
about
him
in
a
certain
curious
way
he
had
when
he
had
lost
something
and
being
knew
not
for
the
moment
what
i
showed
him
his
empty
purse
but
it
was
not
that
so
i
looked
round
and
saw
nothing
but
some
discharged
pistols
lying
with
broken
lingels
abroad
upon
the
sand
and
the
little
book
he
had
been
reading
as
his
palfrey
paced
along
so
as
soon
as
i
showed
the
latter
to
him
he
put
out
his
hand
for
it
then
he
held
it
a
moment
kissed
it
and
gave
it
back
to
me
be
a
good
lad
he
said
quietly
and
composedly
fear
not
for
me
i
go
in
friendship
with
all
men
poor
poor
cloncaird
he
said
thinking
of
one
of
his
murderers
whom
he
had
always
befriended
it
is
a
pity
for
his
wife
and
young
family
then
he
closed
his
eyes
and
we
thought
he
had
already
passed
from
us
but
presently
he
opened
them
again
and
looked
toward
me
be
kind
to
nelly
he
said
smiling
so
kindly
at
me
that
my
heart
nearly
broke
he
shook
his
head
at
seeing
my
grief
and
the
tears
running
down
for
indeed
i
could
not
withhold
them
there
is
no
need
he
said
reprovingly
no
need
for
the
like
of
that
ava
be
a
brave
lad
launcelot
and
just
as
true
to
your
god
as
you
have
proved
to
me
who
have
been
a
loving
master
to
you
here
below
i
am
only
wae
for
the
poor
misguided
lads
that
were
so
far
left
to
themselves
as
to
lay
me
here
like
and
with
that
there
was
but
his
body
on
the
sands
for
the
spirit
of
the
gentlest
master
that
ever
a
man
served
had
gone
its
way
to
its
own
master
but
it
was
even
as
he
the
end
of
such
an
one
there
is
no
need
of
tears
then
i
stood
up
and
the
terrible
thought
came
in
upon
me
like
solway
tide
shall
i
take
him
home
to
helen
his
orphaned
bairns
and
to
the
stricken
house
of
culzean
seek
for
ay
well
might
i
say
it
how
was
i
to
face
nell
that
had
with
a
long
kindly
look
committed
her
father
into
my
keeping
that
very
morning
tenderly
we
lifted
the
body
which
in
life
had
been
so
noble
and
now
was
so
pitifully
mishandled
the
villains
had
despoiled
the
dainty
garmentry
torn
the
lace
and
snatched
the
jewellery
which
helen
kennedy
had
set
in
place
as
daffing
right
merrily
she
prepared
her
father
as
she
said
to
gang
worthily
and
bonnily
before
the
but
the
king
he
went
before
was
one
as
he
himself
would
often
say
that
looked
not
on
the
outer
appearance
but
on
the
heart
and
concerning
that
last
thomas
kennedy
need
have
had
no
fear
that
his
would
not
be
well
looked
it
was
upright
and
kindly
and
true
nor
did
it
ever
move
to
the
hurt
of
any
man
in
all
this
world
and
as
i
took
him
up
i
saw
still
more
clearly
the
rage
of
the
persecutors
for
it
showed
as
manifestly
as
any
other
fact
the
hellish
intent
of
the
murderers
that
they
had
taken
time
even
while
i
was
in
the
act
to
come
at
them
to
despoil
my
master
of
his
purse
with
a
thousand
merks
of
gold
therein
nay
his
very
ring
of
fine
diamonds
they
tore
from
his
finger
and
his
golden
buttons
of
wrought
goldsmith
work
were
riven
from
his
frilled
murderous
loon
snatching
one
thing
and
the
other
another
worse
than
brute
beasts
of
the
field
we
laid
him
gently
upon
the
back
of
wise
dom
nicholas
that
all
the
time
stood
like
a
statue
and
then
when
everything
was
ready
moved
graciously
and
soberly
away
as
though
he
had
been
well
aware
of
the
melancholy
burden
he
bore
even
thus
we
brought
my
dear
master
to
the
sea
terrace
of
greenan
which
he
had
so
lately
left
and
when
john
kennedy
of
balterson
heard
the
trampling
of
the
horse
on
the
flags
of
the
court
he
came
out
crying
loudly
and
heartily
as
was
the
manner
of
the
man
wi
what
s
this
culzean
are
ye
back
again
so
running
to
the
door
he
stood
with
his
in
his
hand
and
a
bit
of
his
meal
thereupon
astonished
beyond
the
utterance
of
words
what
s
this
what
s
this
he
cried
oh
sirs
what
foul
wark
is
here
wha
has
done
this
and
i
told
him
their
least
so
far
as
i
knew
them
thomas
of
drummurchie
he
cried
it
shall
not
be
the
uplands
of
barr
parish
that
shall
keep
ye
frae
the
stark
sword
of
john
kennedy
of
balterson
and
thou
walter
mure
of
cloncaird
that
has
so
often
sat
in
this
house
of
the
greenan
by
the
grace
of
god
i
shall
lay
thee
as
low
as
thou
hast
laid
my
friend
this
but
i
begged
balterson
to
think
of
something
else
than
the
taking
of
which
all
in
good
time
so
presently
he
got
me
a
horse
litter
with
two
beasts
and
i
walked
alongside
it
with
dom
nicholas
arching
his
head
and
treading
softly
as
if
he
also
mourned
thus
we
came
to
the
town
of
maybole
which
was
as
our
own
place
and
such
dule
and
lament
as
there
was
that
day
saw
i
never
anywhere
for
the
town
had
loved
him
as
its
liege
lord
far
more
than
either
john
earl
of
cassillis
or
his
father
the
king
of
carrick
such
a
congregation
as
met
us
at
the
town
gate
the
women
all
crying
the
cry
of
death
the
men
cursing
and
calling
vengeance
the
minister
was
there
to
pray
and
all
classes
and
conditions
were
moved
to
tears
and
ere
we
were
well
past
the
foul
alley
there
were
twenty
men
on
horseback
to
chase
the
murderers
with
john
kennedy
of
balterson
at
their
head
but
they
might
as
well
have
chased
the
wind
for
by
this
time
with
the
relays
of
horse
that
had
been
ordered
for
them
they
were
safe
among
the
wild
crauford
country
on
the
borders
of
kyle
of
the
sad
homecoming
to
culzean
itself
i
declare
i
can
not
write
at
length
at
the
entering
in
of
the
woodland
i
left
them
and
upon
dom
nicholas
i
rode
drearily
forward
to
do
the
bitterest
day
s
work
of
my
tell
helen
kennedy
that
i
brought
only
her
father
s
corpse
home
with
me
and
as
the
chance
befell
it
was
at
least
before
i
reached
the
home
gate
of
culzean
just
where
one
sees
for
the
first
time
the
grey
turrets
sitting
against
the
dimpled
blue
of
the
incoming
tide
that
i
was
aware
of
nell
kennedy
coming
towards
me
singing
a
catch
of
a
song
and
swaying
a
flourish
of
sweet
daintily
in
her
hand
i
have
never
rightly
loved
the
white
hawthorn
since
that
day
but
as
soon
as
she
saw
me
she
stopped
her
song
and
clutched
her
fingers
close
upon
her
palm
for
the
flowery
branch
had
fallen
at
her
feet
what
is
wrong
she
cried
when
i
came
near
to
her
but
i
could
not
answer
till
i
had
leaped
from
dom
nicholas
and
taken
her
by
the
hand
she
turned
round
keeping
me
at
the
stretch
of
her
arm
so
that
she
might
read
the
news
good
or
bad
in
my
eyes
is
it
my
father
tell
me
she
said
very
calmly
nell
it
is
your
father
i
said
as
quietly
they
set
upon
him
and
hurt
him
even
when
he
had
sent
me
on
a
little
way
before
him
that
he
might
be
alone
at
his
is
he
he
dead
she
broke
in
but
i
answered
her
not
for
i
could
not
so
she
knew
and
in
an
instant
grew
as
pale
and
still
as
the
man
that
was
passed
from
us
take
me
to
him
she
said
at
length
and
seeing
that
i
still
hesitated
she
said
do
not
fear
for
me
i
will
do
all
that
a
daughter
of
culzean
should
they
are
bringing
him
hither
now
i
said
i
came
hasting
to
tell
you
the
feet
of
the
horses
that
carry
him
are
even
now
upon
the
then
when
i
had
told
her
all
i
ended
the
tale
with
my
tears
and
with
crying
out
that
which
was
in
my
heart
oh
would
to
god
i
had
died
instead
of
him
launcelot
nell
said
with
a
wonderful
quiet
that
is
useless
and
not
well
said
be
comforted
none
would
have
done
so
much
as
thou
bless
you
nell
i
said
for
i
had
feared
greatly
she
would
have
broken
upon
me
with
bitter
railing
it
was
by
the
great
oak
tree
which
sends
its
boughs
over
the
road
that
we
met
the
bier
and
the
horses
stopped
even
thus
nell
kennedy
met
her
father
and
there
was
not
a
tear
on
her
face
but
only
a
great
sweet
calm
she
silenced
the
noisy
limmer
wives
that
went
behind
crying
and
mourning
aloud
so
in
this
manner
we
went
onward
to
culzean
nell
walking
on
one
side
of
the
bier
and
i
on
the
other
leading
dom
nicholas
by
the
bridle
and
lo
as
the
body
passed
the
drawbridge
a
sudden
gust
out
of
the
sea
snatched
his
knightly
pennon
from
the
topmost
turret
tower
of
the
battlements
of
culzean
which
was
held
a
freit
and
a
warning
by
all
the
folk
of
carrick
but
though
the
master
had
come
home
to
his
own
yet
both
culzean
and
i
were
now
masterless
in
due
time
we
gave
him
stately
funeral
carrying
him
forth
upon
a
day
so
calm
so
breathless
that
the
banners
did
not
wave
as
they
swept
the
dust
and
thereafter
all
life
seemed
to
stop
when
we
came
home
again
to
the
darkened
house
james
and
sandy
the
two
young
lads
played
no
more
in
the
but
went
about
with
linked
arms
speaking
of
revenge
but
little
david
abode
with
nell
and
went
forth
only
with
her
clinging
winsomely
to
her
hand
for
we
kept
us
close
within
bars
and
warded
ramparts
with
the
drawbridge
up
watching
the
fruit
ripening
on
the
walls
of
the
orchard
of
culzean
all
that
splendid
summer
of
the
murder
of
our
lord
and
master
slowly
i
thought
over
many
things
till
the
resolve
to
bring
the
matter
to
a
head
came
masterfully
upon
me
from
the
earl
as
bailzie
of
carrick
i
got
warrant
according
to
my
dead
master
s
word
and
direction
to
be
for
the
young
man
james
who
was
now
the
heir
of
cassilis
for
earl
john
knew
that
launcelot
kennedy
was
no
also
they
that
stood
about
had
told
to
him
the
tutor
s
last
i
was
to
be
a
good
lad
and
to
be
kind
to
nelly
it
was
adam
boyd
of
penkil
and
david
somerville
hosier
in
ayr
who
told
him
this
and
they
were
two
of
those
that
played
golf
by
the
sandhills
on
the
day
of
that
foul
slaying
under
trust
blue
yet
because
i
needed
advice
and
had
none
to
give
it
i
rode
one
day
to
edinburgh
to
see
maister
robert
bruce
i
found
the
whole
city
in
an
uproar
there
was
the
beating
of
drums
in
all
the
streets
and
closes
and
a
great
multitude
of
the
common
folk
crying
out
for
god
and
the
kirk
pikes
danced
merrily
along
the
causeways
and
good
wives
heads
were
thrust
through
all
the
in
the
windings
of
the
stairs
their
voices
shrill
and
vehement
kept
up
a
constant
deafening
clamour
each
calling
to
her
john
or
tam
to
come
awa
in
oot
o
that
or
bidding
them
not
to
mell
wi
what
concerned
them
what
concern
is
the
glory
o
god
o
that
is
but
a
baker
in
coul
s
close
i
heard
one
wife
cry
to
her
man
and
it
seemed
to
me
a
mightily
pertinent
question
at
last
after
many
inquiries
i
heard
how
the
minister
of
edinburgh
had
bearded
the
king
so
that
he
was
gone
off
to
linlithgow
in
great
indignation
and
how
that
in
a
day
or
two
maister
robert
bruce
would
either
be
king
of
scotland
or
lay
his
head
on
the
block
yet
the
minister
was
in
his
study
chamber
when
i
went
to
seek
him
reading
of
his
bible
and
writing
his
sermon
as
quietly
as
though
there
had
been
no
king
in
as
it
might
be
the
king
in
whose
interest
he
had
so
often
bearded
king
jamie
stuart
sixth
of
that
name
robert
bruce
looked
up
when
he
saw
me
ah
launcelot
he
cried
more
heartily
than
ever
i
had
heard
him
ken
ye
lad
that
you
are
likely
to
be
at
the
horn
for
communing
with
a
wild
rebel
like
me
to
be
at
the
horn
is
no
uncommon
thing
in
carrick
i
replied
and
makes
little
difference
either
to
the
length
of
a
man
s
life
or
the
soundness
of
his
sleep
i
have
been
at
the
horn
ever
since
i
was
eighteen
years
of
my
well
launcelot
he
said
soberly
so
it
has
turned
out
even
as
i
said
i
know
it
is
not
in
man
that
walketh
to
direct
his
steps
but
i
saw
ye
were
all
fey
at
then
i
told
him
the
purpose
of
my
coming
all
the
way
to
edinburgh
to
see
him
what
he
said
ye
have
never
come
so
far
only
to
have
speech
of
poor
robert
bruce
that
was
yesterday
minister
of
edinburgh
and
is
i
fear
doomed
to
lay
his
head
on
the
i
told
him
it
was
even
so
and
that
being
the
man
of
wisest
counsel
i
had
ever
known
i
would
have
gone
ten
times
as
far
to
have
his
friendly
advice
ay
me
he
said
sadly
wae
is
the
man
that
has
such
a
rumour
and
report
of
wisdom
yet
can
not
counsel
himself
what
he
should
do
in
his
own
utter
but
for
all
that
he
went
over
everything
that
had
happened
in
carrick
with
a
clearness
most
like
that
of
a
lawyer
when
he
sets
in
order
his
case
before
the
judge
then
he
sat
a
long
while
silent
with
his
finger
tips
drumming
idly
upon
his
writing
so
bargany
is
dead
he
said
at
last
he
was
the
only
considerable
man
of
his
own
faction
who
is
there
to
succeed
him
but
a
child
said
i
one
that
plays
with
as
do
we
all
launcelot
said
maister
bruce
smiling
on
me
and
after
him
in
that
faction
of
his
own
house
and
kin
who
he
asked
there
are
none
besides
the
tutor
s
murderer
thomas
of
drummurchie
and
benane
his
brother
but
he
is
a
deboshed
man
and
of
no
account
i
made
answer
not
seeing
his
drift
who
leads
them
john
mure
of
auchendrayne
is
their
only
considerable
man
and
he
has
waxen
great
and
greater
within
these
the
minister
nodded
his
head
and
sat
still
as
one
that
considers
all
sides
of
a
question
and
of
you
that
stand
by
the
gold
and
remains
he
went
on
i
told
him
but
john
earl
of
cassillis
and
his
brother
the
master
and
in
whose
friendship
is
the
master
he
asked
in
our
country
of
carrick
he
has
an
auld
friendship
with
auchendrayne
and
a
feud
with
the
earl
his
brother
but
recently
he
has
taken
up
with
the
lord
of
garthland
in
galloway
and
married
his
tell
him
from
me
said
the
minister
of
edinburgh
to
bide
close
in
galloway
and
get
him
bairns
in
peace
for
gin
he
comes
back
to
carrick
of
a
surety
his
head
shall
be
the
next
to
and
why
so
said
i
because
said
maister
robert
bruce
john
mure
designs
that
there
shall
be
no
power
in
carrick
nor
in
the
shire
of
ayr
besides
his
own
and
that
of
the
he
get
time
to
have
him
also
killed
i
tell
you
auchendrayne
hath
the
brains
of
any
three
of
and
of
the
treasure
of
kelwood
what
said
i
that
said
the
minister
meditating
is
a
little
forth
of
my
province
but
if
ye
will
know
i
think
it
is
in
the
keeping
of
some
of
auchendrayne
s
tools
and
i
advise
you
ere
ye
look
for
revenge
to
go
seek
for
i
was
silent
for
i
hoped
that
he
would
tell
me
yet
more
the
treasure
of
kelwood
will
lead
you
to
your
aim
i
think
ye
will
find
that
the
same
hands
which
reft
it
away
are
red
with
the
blood
of
your
master
and
one
thing
i
am
sure
within
that
treasure
chest
lie
your
love
your
land
and
your
lordship
i
asked
him
what
he
meant
but
he
would
not
tell
me
more
clearly
only
this
he
said
speaking
like
them
that
have
the
second
sight
james
stuart
being
what
he
john
earl
of
cassillis
being
what
he
ye
find
the
kist
ye
have
them
both
in
your
hand
and
therein
or
i
am
a
false
prophet
lie
as
i
say
your
love
your
land
and
your
then
i
asked
him
if
he
had
any
counsel
to
give
me
ere
i
went
be
brave
he
said
read
your
testament
tell
no
lies
carry
no
tales
seek
carefully
for
the
man
that
wears
the
grey
cloak
and
then
for
the
man
that
runs
like
a
beast
and
carries
the
knife
in
his
he
went
to
the
window
as
one
that
has
spoken
his
last
word
hear
ye
that
he
said
that
is
the
warrant
for
my
there
circulated
a
great
crowd
of
people
without
apprentices
and
suchlike
mostly
with
here
and
there
among
them
a
decent
responsible
man
of
the
trades
they
were
singing
at
the
utmost
pitch
of
their
voices
we
ll
hae
nae
mair
jeems
davie
s

we
ll
gie

sune
an
the
deil
may
tak
jeems
they
might
as
well
shear
my
head
at
once
as
sing
that
song
said
maister
robert
bruce
there
is
nothing
that
james
stuart
likes
so
ill
as
to
be
called
the
son
of
davie
unless
it
be
the
man
who
upholds
the
right
of
private
judgment
ah
he
cried
again
the
blue
waxes
serious
i
must
put
on
my
gown
and
sally
then
up
the
canon
gate
there
came
a
great
crowd
of
citizens
all
marching
together
and
crying
god
and
the
kirk
god
and
the
kirk
and
in
the
midst
there
was
borne
the
famous
flag
that
has
ever
staggered
in
the
front
of
a
bicker
foretelling
storms
and
the
shaking
of
blue
blanket
of
the
trades
of
edinburgh
robert
bruce
drew
his
black
geneva
gown
about
him
and
taking
his
little
bible
and
his
oak
staff
in
his
hand
he
went
out
as
he
stood
forth
upon
his
step
he
was
hailed
with
shouts
of
joy
and
rejoicing
hearken
maister
bruce
hear
the
minister
god
and
the
kirk
doon
wi
jeemie
and
the
blue
blanket
wavered
and
waggled
being
borne
this
way
and
that
by
the
press
all
about
the
skirts
of
the
crowd
and
down
the
closes
angry
drums
were
beating
and
a
hundred
idle
prentices
thundered
on
great
folk
s
doors
and
garred
the
window
panes
rattle
on
the
was
a
sin
when
glass
was
so
dear
and
to
be
seen
in
so
few
places
besides
the
citizen
houses
of
the
great
men
of
edinburgh
cried
bruce
hear
your
minister
wherefore
this
tumult
i
bid
you
to
depart
quietly
to
your
homes
we
have
a
difference
with
the
king
it
is
true
but
let
us
who
are
the
servants
of
god
and
of
the
kirk
of
scotland
settle
our
own
affairs
with
the
king
what
is
your
concern
in
the
matter
but
the
more
he
spoke
of
the
king
the
more
loud
grew
the
tumult
god
and
the
kirk
god
and
the
kirk
they
cried
and
the
blue
blanket
waved
higher
than
ever
being
held
up
by
one
man
standing
upon
the
shoulders
of
other
two
ay
ay
even
so
it
is
a
good
cry
said
the
minister
but
it
would
set
you
better
to
be
a
little
more
ready
to
obey
both
god
and
the
kirk
at
other
times
the
most
part
of
you
know
not
for
what
cause
ye
are
come
together
ye
want
to
roll
your
minister
s
head
in
the
no
no
cried
the
throng
we
will
keep
you
safe
or
know
the
reason
instantly
to
your
firesides
cried
bruce
and
so
ye
will
the
better
serve
the
kirk
of
scotland
and
me
her
unworthy
and
with
this
he
motioned
to
them
with
his
hands
dismissing
them
so
great
was
his
power
that
they
went
scattering
like
peet
reek
on
a
windy
day
in
a
minute
or
two
there
was
not
one
of
them
to
be
seen
on
the
street
the
minister
and
i
were
left
alone
what
think
ye
launcelot
why
stand
ye
so
moody
my
companion
said
to
me
i
told
him
that
i
liked
not
much
to
tell
him
that
it
was
no
fitting
thought
to
tell
a
minister
say
on
he
said
i
have
listed
to
strange
speeches
in
my
well
then
sir
i
made
answer
i
was
thinking
what
a
pity
to
see
so
many
limber
lads
with
stark
pikes
in
their
hands
and
nobody
a
penny
the
worse
i
would
to
god
i
had
them
in
carrick
john
mure
of
auchendrayne
would
hear
news
of
it
right
the
minister
clapped
me
on
the
back
ah
launce
it
will
be
a
strange
heaven
that
you
win
to
unless
you
mend
your
ways
ye
are
nocht
but
a
wild
carrick
savage
but
ye
maun
e
en
dree
your
weird
young
launcelot
and
auld
robert
bruce
maun
dree
his
fare
ye
so
we
parted
there
on
the
steps
of
his
own
house
and
with
that
i
betook
me
to
horse
and
forth
through
the
turbulent
city
that
could
yet
make
so
little
of
its
tulzies
and
as
i
went
i
thought
lord
lord
for
one
hour
of
gilbert
kennedy
and
me
to
show
them
a
better
way
of
it
or
even
robert
harburgh
and
it
would
be
like
capturing
heaven
by
violence
to
enter
holyrood
house
in
the
way
of
stouthrief
and
spulzie
but
i
only
thought
these
things
without
intent
to
do
them
for
i
am
a
king
s
man
and
which
i
had
but
lately
spoken
good
words
to
a
minister
of
religion
nevertheless
what
a
booty
would
there
not
have
been
in
that
palace
at
the
canongate
foot
not
that
i
would
lay
hand
upon
a
stiver
of
it
even
if
i
got
the
chance
but
the
thought
of
it
was
marvellously
refreshing
i
own
meets
greek
then
as
i
journeyed
south
i
saw
my
work
set
out
like
a
perspective
before
me
as
the
minister
had
said
the
treasure
of
kelwood
and
the
death
of
my
master
hung
by
one
string
the
house
of
the
red
moss
was
very
near
to
the
sandhills
of
ayr
and
there
could
be
little
doubt
that
the
hand
which
had
sped
the
bloody
dagger
was
the
hand
that
had
brought
my
master
to
his
death
as
the
drawbridge
clanged
down
for
me
to
ride
once
more
within
the
house
of
culzean
and
lazy
gib
stretched
himself
to
cry
that
all
was
well
i
took
a
resolve
it
was
to
tell
helen
kennedy
all
that
i
knew
and
ask
her
judgment
upon
i
have
small
notion
for
ordinary
of
women
s
discretion
so
when
the
greetings
were
said
i
took
my
opportunity
and
came
to
her
when
she
was
walking
in
the
garden
apart
where
the
apple
trees
grow
when
she
had
heard
all
she
said
launce
you
and
i
must
ride
to
well
said
i
and
what
then
shall
we
bid
grieve
allison
have
our
coffins
in
readiness
against
our
return
feet
first
we
shall
see
my
sister
marjorie
she
said
without
heeding
my
words
and
take
counsel
with
her
they
will
not
kill
us
within
the
house
of
auchendrayne
while
she
is
i
believe
not
that
we
shall
even
have
the
chance
of
speech
with
her
i
replied
but
we
may
at
least
go
and
see
whether
we
ever
win
back
to
culzean
is
another
but
nell
was
mainly
set
on
it
and
i
did
not
counter
her
it
being
so
that
i
was
to
ride
in
her
indeed
i
myself
desired
greatly
to
see
the
famous
tower
where
dwelled
a
man
so
potent
and
so
evil
the
next
day
it
happened
that
i
went
to
maybole
and
found
mine
ancient
friend
robert
mure
dominie
and
session
clerk
of
the
town
he
sat
gloomily
in
his
school
and
bowed
his
head
on
his
hands
for
he
had
never
looked
up
nor
taken
pleasure
in
life
since
they
laid
my
master
in
the
of
his
folk
within
the
kirkyaird
of
maybole
the
school
hummed
about
him
but
he
took
little
heed
his
old
alertness
seemed
quite
gone
from
him
and
when
i
came
in
he
only
lifted
his
head
a
moment
and
nodded
falling
back
again
at
once
into
his
new
melancholy
his
pipes
lay
beside
him
indeed
but
so
long
as
i
was
there
i
did
not
see
him
recreate
himself
upon
had
been
his
ordinary
wont
playing
pibrochs
for
his
scholars
delectation
at
every
pause
in
the
day
s
occupations
dominie
said
i
there
is
one
thing
i
say
on
said
he
briefly
not
looking
at
me
i
want
speech
with
william
dalrymple
the
lad
that
carried
the
letter
to
auchendrayne
the
day
before
my
lord
s
of
what
good
is
the
like
of
that
said
he
will
all
the
speech
in
the
world
bring
back
him
that
s
gane
no
said
i
going
nearer
to
him
and
speaking
under
my
breath
but
it
may
help
us
to
his
eh
what
said
the
master
sitting
up
as
gleg
as
a
cat
at
a
mousehole
his
murderer
said
ye
are
not
thomas
of
drummurchie
and
mure
of
cloncaird
his
declared
murderers
ay
said
i
declared
speak
either
less
or
us
hae
done
wi
parables
quoth
the
dominie
what
think
ye
said
i
of
the
grey
man
that
stood
behind
and
waved
them
on
like
a
pilot
guiding
a
ship
into
a
port
i
mean
the
man
that
threw
the
dagger
into
the
red
house
i
mean
the
man
that
let
loose
the
scum
of
the
tolbooth
on
us
of
cassillis
the
day
of
clear
the
causeway
and
who
might
he
be
said
the
dominie
breaking
in
upon
me
for
some
of
these
things
he
was
not
acquainted
with
first
bring
in
the
laddie
said
i
so
dominie
mure
brought
dalrymple
in
to
a
private
place
and
having
dismissed
the
school
we
proceeded
faithfully
to
examine
him
i
asked
him
to
tell
me
all
that
had
befallen
that
fateful
day
from
the
time
i
had
seen
him
run
up
the
kirk
vennel
to
the
time
when
he
came
to
me
again
upon
the
green
at
my
play
and
making
a
poor
hand
of
it
with
another
man
s
clubs
the
boy
began
his
tale
well
enough
like
one
that
says
a
lesson
but
in
the
very
midst
when
somewhat
severely
i
bade
him
say
over
again
what
he
had
already
said
he
broke
out
into
a
passion
of
weeping
and
begging
us
to
have
mercy
upon
that
he
was
but
a
laddie
and
had
been
commanded
upon
pain
of
his
death
to
tell
the
tale
which
he
had
told
us
at
the
first
so
we
bade
him
to
speak
freely
to
tell
no
lie
anymore
and
all
would
yet
be
well
so
he
told
us
how
he
had
gone
to
auchendrayne
and
had
there
found
john
mure
the
master
thereof
sitting
in
the
great
chamber
with
walter
of
cloncaird
he
described
how
that
he
had
given
the
letter
into
the
laird
s
hands
even
as
he
had
been
bidden
when
mure
had
read
it
he
handed
it
over
to
cloncaird
but
he
swearing
that
he
was
not
gleg
at
the
bade
auchendrayne
to
read
it
aloud
for
him
which
when
he
did
they
looked
long
and
strangely
at
one
another
and
at
last
john
mure
said
i
should
not
wonder
cloncaird
but
something
might
come
out
of
then
the
boy
told
how
they
had
gripped
him
set
a
naked
dagger
to
his
throat
and
afterwards
made
him
swear
to
take
the
letter
back
to
them
that
sent
him
saying
that
he
had
gone
to
auchendrayne
but
had
returned
without
seeing
the
laird
say
said
mure
that
the
servant
bade
you
take
back
the
letter
unopened
because
that
his
master
was
afield
and
he
knew
not
when
he
would
be
home
so
concluded
the
boy
even
thus
i
did
and
this
is
all
the
truth
or
may
god
strike
me
dead
the
dominie
and
i
looked
each
at
the
other
in
our
turns
the
grey
man
himself
said
i
the
black
deil
himsel
said
he
we
will
exorcise
him
black
or
grey
cried
the
dominie
i
am
going
direct
to
the
bailies
and
elders
to
tell
them
that
this
school
has
vacation
till
it
pleases
me
to
take
it
up
so
he
went
out
and
i
waited
alone
with
the
boy
william
dalrymple
whose
rosy
and
innocent
face
was
all
beblubbered
with
weeping
i
slapped
him
on
the
shoulder
and
bade
him
take
heart
because
he
had
found
friends
then
i
also
told
him
that
on
the
morrow
he
must
come
with
me
to
the
earl
of
cassillis
and
it
might
be
to
the
king
himself
will
the
dominie
come
too
the
boy
asked
very
anxiously
so
when
i
told
him
that
he
would
he
seemed
more
satisfied
and
asked
leave
to
go
home
to
his
mother
i
had
indeed
something
to
tell
nell
kennedy
that
night
when
i
rode
home
from
maybole
and
upon
the
head
of
it
we
two
sat
long
in
talk
and
were
more
than
ever
set
on
riding
to
auchendrayne
but
first
we
decided
that
the
dominie
and
i
should
carry
william
dalrymple
to
the
earl
that
he
might
certify
to
him
what
he
had
already
testified
to
us
at
the
schoolhouse
in
the
kirk
vennel
but
on
the
morrow
we
that
is
the
dominie
and
i
had
it
set
to
ride
to
cassillis
by
way
of
maybole
on
the
way
we
came
to
the
little
hut
of
the
widow
dalrymple
for
william
was
a
town
s
bursar
and
so
got
his
learning
from
the
session
as
a
poor
scholar
the
door
was
shut
and
a
neighbour
s
wife
cried
to
us
that
both
the
boy
and
his
mother
had
gone
on
to
cassillis
before
us
so
we
rode
forward
yet
we
must
have
missed
them
on
the
way
for
when
we
came
to
the
castle
yett
there
was
nobody
there
before
us
and
the
earl
himself
had
ridden
forth
to
the
hawking
by
the
waterside
then
came
out
to
us
foolish
sir
thomas
tode
with
his
long
story
which
began
as
usual
with
the
black
vault
of
dunure
and
was
proceeding
by
devious
ways
when
his
wife
came
round
the
right
briskly
he
changed
his
tune
and
as
i
was
saying
he
said
on
tuesday
seven
nights
we
had
a
shrewd
frost
that
nipped
the
it
is
as
well
for
you
old
dotard
cried
his
wife
listening
a
moment
i
had
thought
ye
were
at
your
auld
tricks
so
we
went
in
and
were
busily
partaking
of
the
cheer
of
mistress
tode
when
we
became
aware
of
the
noise
of
altercation
without
save
us
said
the
cook
it
is
a
mercy
that
neither
my
lord
nor
my
lady
are
within
gate
wi
a
that
narration
of
noise
outbye
what
can
it
be
at
a
and
she
went
out
to
inquire
but
if
the
disturbance
was
loud
before
it
certainly
became
ten
times
worse
when
mistress
tode
disappeared
i
got
up
to
look
and
the
dominie
followed
me
we
saw
a
tall
woman
stand
upon
the
causeway
of
the
courtyard
with
one
hand
on
her
hip
and
with
the
other
tossing
back
the
straying
witch
locks
from
her
brow
where
s
my
boy
mistress
tode
cried
the
newcomer
fiercely
to
our
friend
the
cook
who
stood
upon
the
steps
what

when

meg

this

bit
deeper
into
the
feelings
of
the
lady
of
sir
thomas
tode
than
all
the
other
reproaches
for

said

turning
round
unexpectedly
and
catching
the
dominie

by

arm
she
pushed
him
forward
and
clapped

in
a
knowing
way
on

shoulder
just
this
decent
snod
bit
mannikie
she
said
again
woman
said
the
dominie
very
indignantly
what

just

honest
man
said
mistress
tode

that

sicht
and
extract
o
them
under
date
fourteenth
o
januar
fifteen
hundred
and
aughty
the
stroke
told
meg
dalrymple
grew
silent
the
anger
faded
out
of
her
face
suddenly
as
the
shining
on
wet
sea
sand
when
you
lift
your
foot
the
warlike
crook
of
her
elbow
flattened
to
a
droop
for
the
session
records
of
the
kirk
of
scotland
are
the
nearest
thing
to
the
books
of
the
recording
angel
and
the
opening
of
them
is
a
little
day
of
judgment
to
half
the
parish
but
we
could
not
let
the
poor
woman
depart
in
this
fashion
i
stepped
to
the
door
from
behind
the
pillar
where
i
had
been
listening
for
the
ending
of
the
fray
mistress
dalrymple
i
said
very
quietly
your
lad
has
never
come
to
cassillis
at
all
we
came
here
to
meet
him
he
must
have
lost
his
maister
launcelot
said
meg
dalrymple
in
a
changed
voice
ye
come
o
a
guid
kind
hoose
and
ye
tell
no
lies
i
am
free
to
believe
you
but
my
bairn
is
tint
a
the
same
what
will
i
do
oh
what
will
i
do
go
home
and
bide
quiet
i
bade
her
gently
i
shall
myself
speak
to
the
earl
and
fear
not
but
we
will
find
your
lad
if
he
be
in
the
devil
is
a
but
william
dalrymple
was
not
to
be
so
easily
gotten
high
and
low
he
was
sought
for
but
no
trace
of
him
was
found
a
girl
had
seen
him
taking
the
road
to
cassillis
with
the
dust
rising
behind
him
as
was
his
wont
for
as
i
have
said
he
was
the
best
runner
in
the
school
of
maybole
and
in
the
winter
forenights
he
kept
himself
in
fine
practice
with
outrunning
rob
nickerson
the
town
s
watchman
so
on
a
day
since
no
better
might
be
nell
kennedy
and
i
rode
out
to
auchendrayne
at
first
we
had
it
trysted
to
go
by
ourselves
but
dominie
mare
declared
that
he
would
come
with
and
wait
in
the
hall
if
ye
were
asked
to
gang
ben
as
he
said
meaningly
for
they
might
put
you
and
the
lassie
awa
and
never
hear
mair
of
it
but
even
john
mure
and
his
son
would
think
twice
before
they
either
sequestered
or
murdered
the
dominie
o
maybole
and
the
clerk
of
the
kirk
session
so
though
his
coming
with
us
wearied
nell
and
myself
somewhat
and
hindered
our
discourse
on
the
journey
it
all
turned
out
for
the
best
in
the
end
as
things
that
are
bitter
in
the
taking
often
do
i
was
i
will
own
monstrously
curious
to
see
the
tower
of
auchendrayne
and
the
surroundings
of
it
for
there
were
strange
rumours
in
the
countryside
concerning
gangs
of
wild
savage
folk
that
sometimes
camped
under
the
trees
and
tales
of
horrid
faces
which
might
at
any
moment
glower
at
you
from
the
dark
bole
of
a
gnarled
oak
but
this
fair
sunshiny
day
we
that
rode
saw
nothing
but
the
leaves
rustling
and
clashing
above
us
and
heard
nothing
but
the
sough
and
murmur
of
the
doon
water
beneath
us
auchendrayne
is
a
place
hidden
among
on
a
knoll
indeed
but
with
trees
all
about
it
not
conspicuous
and
like
the
newark
or
culzean
when
first
we
saw
it
the
grey
battlements
looked
pleasantly
enough
out
of
the
greenery
basking
as
peacefully
in
the
sun
as
though
they
had
risen
over
the
abode
of
some
hermit
or
saint
we
saw
nought
of
the
customary
stir
and
bustle
of
an
habited
house
about
the
mansion
of
auchendrayne
none
ran
to
the
office
houses
none
carried
bundle
nor
drove
cattle
about
the
home
parks
it
was
a
peace
like
that
of
a
sabbath
day
a
black
devil
s
sabbath
said
the
dominie
grimly
and
in
truth
there
was
something
not
altogether
canny
about
thus
coming
to
a
dead
and
silent
house
with
the
sun
shining
hot
and
the
broad
common
day
all
about
and
above
nor
even
when
we
dismounted
did
any
servant
or
retainer
come
forth
to
meet
or
challenge
us
we
did
not
see
so
much
as
the
flutter
of
a
banner
or
the
gleam
of
a
steel
cap
only
there
about
us
was
the
silent
courtyard
with
the
heat
of
noon
trembling
athwart
it
and
the
very
paving
stones
clean
swept
like
a
table
before
the
feast
is
set
i
tied
our
horses
to
the
iron
ring
of
a
stone
which
stood
at
the
angle
of
the
wall
by
the
gate
thinking
as
i
did
so
that
if
only
these
steps
could
speak
they
could
tell
a
tale
worth
hearkening
to
of
strange
venturings
and
bloody
quests
also
i
loosened
my
sword
and
i
think
i
saw
the
dominie
lay
his
hand
to
his
hip
ere
nell
and
i
set
forward
together
we
went
up
the
steps
of
the
outside
stair
and
as
we
did
so
we
came
within
hearing
of
a
little
continuous
murmur
of
hoarse
sound
the
doors
were
all
open
and
i
wot
well
that
we
walked
softly
and
with
our
hearts
in
our
mouths
for
the
silence
and
the
strangeness
of
the
deadly
house
of
auchendrayne
daunted
me
more
than
the
clash
of
swords
or
the
crack
of
pistols
but
i
had
nell
kennedy
by
me
and
i
would
have
gone
to
destruction
s
for
her
saving
my
father
and
mother
she
was
the
only
friend
i
had
suddenly
in
our
advance
we
came
to
the
door
of
a
great
hall
where
at
the
upper
end
was
a
table
in
the
midst
the
windows
were
narrow
and
high
throwing
down
but
a
dim
light
upon
the
floor
there
were
many
servants
and
others
sitting
in
the
hall
and
at
the
further
end
stood
one
who
read
from
a
book
as
soon
as
our
eyes
became
accustomed
to
the
cool
duskiness
after
the
white
equal
glare
without
i
perceived
that
the
reader
was
none
other
than
john
mure
himself
about
him
there
sat
all
his
servants
and
retainers
both
men
and
women
it
was
the
crown
of
my
astonishment
to
hear
that
the
book
from
which
he
read
was
the
bible
and
also
that
as
he
went
on
he
made
comments
like
a
minister
expounding
his
morning
chapter
speaking
very
seasonably
and
fitly
and
eke
with
excellent
judgment
and
sense
or
so
at
least
it
seemed
to
me
for
i
am
not
enough
of
a
clerk
to
be
a
judge
of
expositions
though
my
father
has
the
two
great
volumes
of
clerk
his
on
the
shelf
over
the
mantel
but
though
he
is
fond
of
these
himself
he
never
rubbed
any
of
his
liking
into
me
but
we
were
hearkening
to
the
reading
of
john
mure
in
his
own
hall
of
auchendrayne
fill
ye
up
then
the
measures
of
your
fathers
somewhat
in
this
fashion
he
read
from
his
place
ye
serpents
ye
generation
of
vipers
how
shall
ye
escape
the
damnation
of
hell
wherefore
behold
i
send
unto
you
prophets
and
wise
men
and
scribes
and
some
of
them
ye
shall
kill
and
crucify
and
some
of
them
shall
ye
scourge
in
your
synagogues
and
persecute
them
from
city
to
upon
you
may
come
all
the
righteous
blood
shed
upon
the
earth
from
the
blood
of
righteous
abel
unto
the
blood
of
zacharias
son
of
barachias
whom
ye
slew
between
the
temple
and
the
altar
verily
i
say
unto
you
all
these
things
shall
come
upon
this
generation
having
read
this
word
which
knowing
what
i
knew
i
had
thought
would
have
made
him
sink
through
the
earth
with
the
fear
of
condemnation
john
mure
commented
upon
it
showing
how
it
applied
to
such
as
refused
the
right
gospel
way
and
walked
in
devious
courses
careless
of
god
and
man
then
he
went
on
with
his
reading
in
the
same
clear
and
solemn
voice
though
he
must
perforce
have
seen
us
stand
in
the
hall
door
so
soon
as
the
reading
was
over
the
great
company
of
the
retainers
decently
took
their
departure
walking
out
soberly
and
without
hurry
then
came
john
mure
down
from
the
dais
with
the
bible
yet
in
his
hand
and
welcomed
us
with
a
condescension
that
was
quaint
and
uncanny
ye
have
gotten
us
at
our
devotions
mistress
helen
and
you
master
launcelot
and
dominie
good
cousin
you
could
not
have
found
us
better
do
ye
believe
what
ye
read
asked
the
dominie
quickly
whatever
is
a
means
to
an
end
that
i
believe
as
you
believe
in
your
taws
and
birch
twigs
the
reading
of
scripture
threatenings
makes
quiet
bairns
and
so
does
the
what
think
ye
of
the
blood
of
righteous
abel
said
the
methought
more
boldness
than
discretion
will
it
cry
from
the
ground
think
ye
the
laird
of
auchendrayne
looked
at
the
little
dominie
as
one
might
upon
a
fractious
but
entertaining
bairn
it
is
a
point
much
disputed
ye
had
better
ask
our
launcelot
s
friend
maister
robert
bruce
minister
of
edinburgh
if
perchance
his
head
be
yet
upon
his
which
saying
showed
me
that
john
mure
knew
more
than
i
had
given
him
the
credit
for
then
he
turned
to
nell
you
would
wish
to
see
the
young
lady
auchendrayne
he
said
courteously
nell
replied
coldly
enough
i
should
like
to
see
my
i
think
said
auchendrayne
with
a
wiselike
and
grave
sobriety
that
set
well
on
his
reverend
person
that
she
is
presently
in
the
orchard
will
you
bide
here
or
will
you
go
with
mistress
helen
he
asked
of
me
we
would
all
go
together
said
nell
if
it
pleasure
so
with
a
courteous
wave
of
the
hand
he
led
us
through
stone
passages
and
along
echoing
corridors
till
we
came
to
a
door
in
the
wall
from
which
we
entered
upon
a
pleasant
prospect
of
gardens
and
orchards
here
again
there
was
the
same
curious
silence
and
as
it
seemed
an
absence
of
the
twitter
and
stir
of
a
scottish
garden
in
the
season
of
summer
we
came
presently
to
a
stone
building
like
a
tomb
all
overshaded
with
trees
this
is
the
orchard
house
of
auchendrayne
he
said
i
believe
the
lady
marjorie
is
the
dominie
and
i
stayed
without
with
john
mure
while
nell
went
in
alone
to
greet
her
sister
we
heard
the
faint
murmur
of
voices
and
now
and
then
a
pulsing
check
as
of
a
slow
smothered
sob
we
that
were
without
stood
with
our
backs
to
the
cold
heavy
white
stones
under
the
green
shade
while
john
mure
discoursed
learnedly
and
pleasantly
of
and
tulips
and
the
best
form
of
dovecot
tower
for
the
supply
of
the
table
with
pigeon
pie
at
last
nell
came
to
the
door
launcelot
marjorie
wishes
you
to
come
in
she
said
whereupon
i
entered
and
found
a
large
room
finished
in
oaken
panelling
and
moulded
archings
roses
looked
in
at
the
windows
and
a
stir
of
pleasant
coolness
was
all
about
marjorie
was
sitting
by
a
table
with
many
books
spread
upon
it
my
dear
lady
was
pale
and
white
as
a
lily
she
leaned
her
head
wearily
on
her
hand
but
there
burned
a
still
and
unslockened
fire
in
her
eye
launcelot
she
said
to
me
this
is
not
so
wide
a
place
to
walk
within
as
the
pleasaunce
at
culzean
nor
yet
can
we
see
from
the
garden
house
of
auchendrayne
the
rough
blue
edges
of
arran
or
the
round
haystack
of
ailsa
i
bade
her
look
forward
to
happy
days
yet
to
come
for
indeed
i
knew
not
what
to
say
to
her
she
smiled
upon
me
wistfully
and
indulgently
as
one
does
upon
a
prattling
child
i
thank
you
launcelot
she
said
but
i
was
not
born
for
happiness
nevertheless
you
were
ever
my
good
lad
i
see
you
still
wear
my
favour
but
doubtless
long
ere
this
you
have
found
another
lady
is
it
not
so
i
told
her
no
blushing
to
have
to
say
so
in
the
hearing
of
afterwards
might
flout
me
or
as
like
as
not
cast
up
again
the
old
matter
of
kate
allison
then
through
one
of
the
windows
i
saw
john
mure
pacing
up
and
down
the
path
with
the
dominie
at
the
other
side
of
the
garden
so
i
knew
that
it
was
our
time
to
speak
ye
have
heard
of
your
father
s
death
said
i
what
think
ye
how
was
it
wrought
and
how
brought
about
can
you
help
us
to
unravel
it
nay
said
marjorie
not
at
present
but
in
good
time
i
shall
yet
clear
the
matter
to
the
roots
and
that
before
i
wherefore
will
you
not
come
back
to
us
at
culzean
we
need
you
sorely
pleaded
nell
who
stood
holding
her
sister
s
hand
nay
said
marjorie
my
work
is
not
yet
done
at
it
was
the
answer
she
had
given
when
she
rode
away
from
the
gate
of
maybole
on
the
day
of
the
death
of
gilbert
kennedy
of
bargany
are
they
cruel
to
you
here
marjorie
tell
me
that
i
said
for
i
saw
that
the
old
laird
was
approaching
and
that
our
further
time
would
be
but
short
no
one
of
them
hath
laid
so
much
as
a
finger
upon
me
said
marjorie
and
this
at
least
was
some
comfort
to
carry
back
to
the
sad
house
of
culzean
with
us
so
with
that
little
satisfied
concerning
the
thing
which
we
came
to
seek
but
with
somewhat
more
ease
in
our
hearts
for
marjorie
s
sake
we
went
back
through
the
passages
and
into
the
great
hall
while
we
waited
there
for
a
servant
to
show
us
forth
to
our
horses
my
eye
rested
upon
a
large
volume
with
the
quill
pen
laid
upon
it
and
set
in
a
hole
in
the
desk
above
it
i
see
that
my
clerkly
work
has
caught
your
eye
said
john
mure
it
is
a
nothing
that
i
amuse
myself
withal
yet
it
may
live
longer
than
you
or
i
it
is
but
a
slight
history
of
the
mighty
sept
whose
name
you
master
launcelot
so
worthily
bear
with
all
their
branches
and
noble
deeds
at
arms
for
me
i
am
but
a
useless
old
man
past
the
labour
of
fighting
yea
i
know
it
was
your
own
lance
that
put
me
there
but
i
bear
no
malice
it
was
the
fortune
of
war
you
know
me
better
than
to
suppose
that
john
mure
bears
a
grudge
for
that
shrewd
thrust
you
dealt
me
on
the
day
of
the
quenching
of
our
hopes
in
blood
by
the
gate
of
i
bowed
and
thanked
him
for
his
courteous
words
it
was
indeed
the
gallantest
charge
that
ever
was
made
said
i
since
that
of
norman
leslie
when
on
the
day
before
renti
he
drava
into
the
midst
of
sixty
spaniards
with
but
seven
scottish
lances
at
his
sir
said
i
i
am
no
historian
but
a
soldier
yet
is
it
a
part
of
the
training
of
a
good
fighter
that
he
should
know
the
great
deeds
which
have
been
done
in
the
wars
before
him
by
brave
men
so
that
he
may
emulate
them
when
he
himself
is
launched
upon
the
points
it
is
well
said
sir
squire
said
auchendrayne
bowing
to
me
so
with
a
courteous
farewell
in
which
there
was
to
be
seen
no
grain
of
hate
nor
as
much
as
a
glint
of
the
teeth
or
the
wolf
he
bade
us
go
our
ways
and
above
all
things
he
cried
after
us
mind
your
prayers
tis
a
good
lesson
for
the
young
to
the
enemy
s
now
through
being
with
my
chronicle
i
have
spent
too
much
time
on
our
conferences
but
we
were
indeed
at
the
parting
of
the
ways
and
needed
all
advice
on
our
way
to
culzean
we
met
one
who
told
us
that
the
earl
had
gone
home
that
day
to
cassillis
nell
besought
me
to
ride
thither
for
she
had
a
request
to
make
to
the
head
of
her
house
ere
she
went
her
ways
back
to
culzean
so
to
cassillis
we
rode
and
at
the
gate
encountered
robert
harburgh
dressed
as
usual
in
his
dark
doublet
and
with
his
long
plain
sword
by
his
side
with
him
i
abode
while
helen
went
within
to
pay
her
duty
and
service
to
the
as
nell
told
me
afterwards
never
stopped
praising
the
ancient
days
when
she
was
the
chancellor
s
wife
and
had
one
of
the
ladies
of
the
court
to
attire
her
now
she
said
bitterly
john
grudges
it
if
i
take
a
milkmaid
from
the
to
help
to
arrange
my
presently
the
earl
came
out
he
showed
himself
well
pleased
and
kind
as
indeed
he
ever
was
with
because
i
never
asked
aught
of
him
in
all
my
life
helen
our
cousin
said
he
desires
that
she
may
go
and
bide
among
the
heather
with
your
good
mother
at
kirrieoch
what
think
ye
of
that
i
told
him
that
i
had
not
heard
of
she
had
spoken
no
word
to
me
see
to
the
matter
he
said
with
significance
i
have
been
advised
concerning
sir
thomas
and
his
last
words
and
if
you
prove
worthy
i
know
no
reason
why
ye
should
not
have
the
lass
but
first
ye
must
find
the
treasure
of
kelwood
or
bring
down
her
father
s
of
the
two
and
then
when
that
is
done
i
pledge
you
my
knightly
word
that
ye
shall
have
both
the
lass
and
a
suitable
providing
besides
which
if
i
am
in
favour
with
the
king
ye
may
even
get
a
clap
on
the
shoulder
from
the
flat
of
a
royal
sword
but
that
said
he
i
can
nocht
promise
ye
for
with
king
jamie
no
man
s
favour
is
i
told
him
that
i
kenned
not
rightly
if
the
lass
would
have
me
that
i
never
spoke
a
single
word
of
love
to
her
but
what
she
lightlied
me
in
good
time
said
the
earl
smiling
and
nodding
the
lass
that
wants
in
time
of
stress
to
gang
and
bide
with
the
minnie
will
draw
not
unkindly
to
the
son
in
times
of
then
came
nell
with
a
knitted
shawl
from
the
countess
to
wear
among
the
hills
for
earl
john
and
she
were
kind
folk
enough
in
all
that
touched
not
the
getting
or
spending
of
gear
i
asked
my
lord
also
for
the
company
of
robert
harburgh
to
help
me
in
the
escorting
of
nell
fitly
to
the
little
tower
of
kirrieoch
on
the
side
of
the
minnoch
water
ay
ay
let
him
gang
said
the
earl
the
honeymoon
is
by
and
his
wife
will
be
the
fonder
of
him
for
lying
her
lane
till
he
comes
hame
to
her
so
robert
harburgh
and
his
long
sword
went
southward
from
cassillis
along
with
us
riding
mostly
with
the
dominie
while
i
rode
behind
with
nell
i
told
her
all
our
plans
as
we
went
how
we
must
seek
the
treasure
and
how
we
must
above
all
things
find
the
boy
dalrymple
i
will
go
with
you
upon
your
quest
the
staunch
little
dominie
had
said
to
me
when
he
heard
of
our
adventure
and
so
it
fell
out
that
we
four
rode
steadily
to
the
south
till
we
came
in
the
evening
to
my
own
where
the
whaups
cry
where
the
burnies
go
chuckling
to
themselves
and
clattering
over
the
pebbles
and
where
all
the
folk
s
hearts
are
kindly
and
warm
my
mother
took
my
lass
in
her
arms
when
we
told
her
our
purpose
and
nell
s
request
and
i
will
help
you
with
the
kye
said
nell
blithely
to
her
ay
answered
my
mother
ye
will
help
with
the
drinking
of
the
milk
and
that
will
e
en
bring
some
roses
back
into
your
cheeks
my
puir
bit
shilpit
and
though
there
passed
not
a
look
by
the
common
between
us
when
we
parted
i
think
my
mother
shrewdly
jaloosed
what
were
my
hopes
thus
we
left
them
standing
by
the
loan
dyke
the
two
old
folk
and
nell
with
her
yellow
hair
in
the
midst
and
i
that
knew
not
whether
i
might
ever
see
them
again
waved
a
hand
and
resolved
to
return
with
a
name
and
a
barony
at
the
least
or
if
my
lot
were
perverse
to
leave
my
bones
in
some
stricken
field
it
is
hard
for
a
man
to
part
from
a
in
especial
from
one
to
whom
he
dares
not
make
love
as
he
has
done
to
others
all
because
those
others
have
told
upon
him
till
he
fears
the
ridicule
of
his
real
love
more
than
rapier
thrusts
right
bitterly
did
i
regret
that
i
had
done
my
so
near
home
because
on
my
very
life
i
dared
not
venture
a
sweet
word
to
nell
kennedy
for
fear
of
her
saying
that
is
even
what
you
said
to
kate
allison
the
grieve
s
or
as
it
might
keep
to
your
customs
it
is
not
your
usual
time
yet
by
a
to
put
your
arm
about
our
now
this
is
monstrously
unfair
to
any
man
who
after
all
is
compelled
to
conduct
his
affairs
with
some
sort
of
rule
and
plan
of
attack
i
was
a
do
i
know
it
i
ought
to
have
gone
further
afield
than
the
grieve
s
house
i
am
sure
there
are
plenty
of
lasses
in
carrick
fairer
to
look
upon
than
kate
allison
though
i
am
free
to
admit
that
i
thought
not
so
at
the
time
so
as
we
went
back
it
was
arranged
that
robert
harburgh
should
ride
to
the
woodland
country
about
auchendrayne
and
there
from
his
headquarters
at
cassillis
keep
his
eye
upon
the
doings
of
the
mures
because
his
person
was
unknown
to
them
of
auchendrayne
s
household
the
dominie
and
i
undertook
the
more
uncertain
work
but
we
had
made
our
plans
and
were
not
to
be
put
off
the
neighbourhood
of
the
benane
was
well
known
to
all
that
trafficked
about
the
town
of
girvan
it
was
a
dangerous
and
an
place
and
many
innocent
people
had
very
mysteriously
lost
their
lives
there
or
at
least
disappeared
to
return
no
more
in
order
therefore
that
we
might
be
more
free
to
pursue
our
wanderings
we
left
our
horses
behind
us
indeed
dom
nicholas
was
even
now
cropping
the
sweet
grasses
on
the
side
of
the
minnoch
water
with
my
father
to
show
him
where
they
grew
thickest
and
my
mother
to
give
him
oats
between
times
till
the
brave
beast
was
in
some
danger
of
being
overfed
as
we
neared
girvan
we
came
into
a
country
of
the
bitterest
partizans
of
the
bargany
folk
here
dwelt
james
bannatyne
of
chapeldonnan
one
of
the
great
intimates
of
john
mure
and
much
beholden
to
him
here
also
was
girvan
mains
over
the
possession
of
which
much
of
the
black
blood
had
arisen
so
for
our
safety
we
gave
ourselves
out
to
be
plain
merchants
travelling
to
stranrawer
in
order
to
get
a
passage
over
to
ireland
when
we
came
to
the
farmhouses
where
we
were
to
stay
for
the
night
we
always
asked
of
the
good
man
in
the
hearing
of
his
wife
concerning
the
state
of
the
country
was
it
peaceful
were
the
bloody
feuds
staunched
and
could
honest
men
now
live
in
peace
we
heard
as
was
natural
a
great
deal
of
abuse
of
the
earl
and
of
our
faction
as
the
greediest
and
rascals
in
the
world
that
from
the
goodman
but
when
the
wife
got
her
tongue
started
she
would
tell
us
much
that
was
no
credit
to
drummurchie
and
others
on
the
side
of
the
murderers
soon
we
were
fully
certified
that
we
were
already
in
the
country
where
drummurchie
and
cloncaird
and
the
rest
of
their
party
were
being
secretly
sustained
by
their
friends
yet
we
could
not
come
at
them
which
perhaps
was
as
well
seeing
that
my
person
was
well
known
to
them
i
found
the
little
dominie
a
right
brave
companion
when
we
sojourned
at
houses
he
had
a
way
with
the
bairns
that
kept
them
on
the
trot
to
do
his
will
and
pleasured
to
do
manner
also
of
the
parents
about
their
children
which
showed
them
his
interest
and
his
knowledge
then
he
would
most
wisely
and
soberly
advise
them
to
see
and
give
this
lad
alec
a
good
education
to
make
that
one
a
merchant
because
of
his
cleverness
with
figures
and
this
a
dominie
or
a
clerk
because
he
did
not
give
promise
of
being
fit
for
anything
else
it
was
as
good
as
a
play
to
hear
him
and
made
us
much
thought
of
whereever
we
went
yet
he
was
ready
with
his
fighting
tools
also
once
when
we
went
by
kildonan
and
a
pack
of
dirty
vagabonds
bade
us
stand
what
was
my
surprise
to
find
that
dominie
mure
having
laid
down
his
pipes
and
out
with
his
blade
was
already
driving
among
them
before
i
had
got
so
much
as
my
hand
on
the
sword
blade
and
i
am
no
laggard
either
with
the
iron
as
all
may
know
by
this
time
but
with
his
great
bristling
fierce
head
and
his
rapier
that
thrust
up
unexpectedly
from
below
yet
which
with
the
length
of
his
arm
reached
as
far
as
a
tall
man
s
the
dominie
gave
the
rascals
a
fright
and
a
wound
or
two
also
which
started
them
at
the
run
even
then
he
followed
thrusting
at
them
behind
till
they
shouted
amain
and
took
across
the
fields
to
escape
the
pricking
of
his
merciless
weapon
and
ever
as
they
ran
he
cried
halt
and
deliver
did
ye
say
i
will
give
you
a
bellyful
of
halt
and
deliver
ogre
s
so
being
wearied
with
the
chase
we
went
to
the
nearest
farm
which
as
it
happened
was
that
of
chapeldonnan
it
stood
quite
close
by
the
roadside
a
tall
woman
came
to
the
gate
with
a
pail
of
pigs
meat
in
her
hand
what
seek
ye
she
said
we
want
nae
travelling
folk
about
we
told
her
that
we
were
merchants
going
to
ireland
and
that
we
had
been
attacked
by
a
set
of
rascals
upon
the
way
whom
we
had
made
flee
they
are
no
that
ill
in
this
pairt
o
the
country
they
wad
only
hae
killed
ye
she
said
as
if
that
would
have
been
a
satisfaction
to
us
it
is
doon
aboot
the
benane
that
the
real
ill
folk
i
told
her
that
killing
was
enough
for
me
and
that
i
was
puzzled
to
know
what
worse
she
could
mean
so
with
some
seeming
reluctance
she
bade
us
come
in
the
wide
quadrangle
of
the
farm
buildings
was
defended
like
a
fortress
the
gate
was
spiked
and
barred
with
iron
from
post
to
post
as
though
it
had
been
the
gate
of
a
fighting
baron
instead
of
the
yett
of
a
tenant
devised
only
to
keep
in
the
kye
we
asked
civilly
for
the
master
of
the
house
and
somewhat
hastily
the
woman
answered
us
the
guidman
s
no
at
hame
he
has
been
away
ower
by
at
the
craig
trying
to
win
the
harvest
of
the
solan
geese
and
your
husband
is
tenant
of
the
rock
i
said
for
it
is
always
worth
while
finding
out
what
a
man
like
james
bannatyne
may
be
doing
or
at
least
how
much
he
thinks
it
advisable
to
tell
ow
ay
she
said
and
a
bonny
holding
it
is
gin
it
werena
for
the
ailsa
cocks
the
conies
and
the
doos
it
wad
be
a
aboot
our
necks
for
we
have
to
pay
sweetly
for
the
rent
o
it
to
my
lady
of
but
said
i
it
belongs
to
the
earl
does
it
not
the
mistress
of
chapeldonnan
looked
pityingly
at
us
ye
are
twa
men
to
be
so
ignorant
ye
maun
hae
been
lang
awa
frae
this
pairt
o
the
country
no
to
ken
that
the
neighbourhood
is
very
unhealthy
for
the
friends
o
the
earl
o
cassillis
to
come
here
faith
the
last
that
cam
speerin
for
rent
and
mails
in
this
quarter
gat
six
inch
o
cauld
steel
in
the
wame
o
him
and
what
said
the
dominie
became
o
him
after
that
did
he
manage
to
recover
na
na
he
was
buried
in
colmonel
kirkyaird
the
good
man
of
boghead
gied
him
a
and
a
headstone
it
was
thought
to
be
very
kind
o
him
it
was
boghead
himsel
that
stickit
ye
see
what
it
is
to
be
a
christian
good
wife
said
the
dominie
ow
ay
lad
said
the
woman
placidly
that
was
generally
remarked
on
at
the
time
ye
see
boghead
was
aye
a
forgiein
man
a
his
days
but
for
a
that
it
was
the
general
opinion
o
the
pairish
that
the
thing
might
be
carried
ower
far
when
it
cam
to
setting
up
my
lord
of
cassillis
s
folks
wi
graves
and
headstones
she
continued
after
a
pause
i
hae
been
deevin
at
our
guidman
to
gie
up
the
craig
for
it
keeps
him
a
deal
from
hame
and
i
aye
tell
him
that
he
carries
awa
mair
than
he
brings
back
o
drink
and
victual
but
he
says
that
the
rock
is
a
maist
extraordinary
hungrysome
place
it
has
that
name
said
i
unwarily
she
stopped
and
looked
at
me
with
sudden
suspicion
what
ken
ye
aboot
the
ailsa
she
asked
looking
directly
at
me
nocht
ava
i
replied
but
a
seaside
places
hae
the
name
o
making
your
ready
for
you
meal
of
hoot
no
said
mistress
bannatyne
now
there
s
mysel
i
canna
do
mair
than
tak
a
pickin
o
meat
like
a
sparrow
on
the
lip
o
the
swinepot
yet
chapeldonnan
is
but
a
step
frae
the
she
was
at
that
moment
lifting
a
heavy
iron
pot
off
the
cleps
or
iron
hooks
by
which
it
hung
over
the
fireplace
in
the
midst
of
the
kitchen
floor
i
hae
aye
been
delicate
a
my
days
and
it
is
an
awesome
thing
for
a
woman
like
me
to
be
tied
to
a
big
eater
like
james
that
never
kens
when
he
has
his
a
corbie
howkin
at
a
braxy
sheep
till
there
was
naething
left
but
the
horns
and
the
i
thought
we
might
get
some
information
about
the
benane
which
might
prove
of
some
use
to
us
when
we
adventured
thither
good
wife
said
i
we
are
thinking
of
going
by
ballantrae
to
the
town
of
stranrawer
the
direct
way
i
hear
is
by
the
benane
what
think
the
road
a
good
one
ye
are
a
sonsy
lad
she
said
ye
wad
mak
braw
pickin
for
the
teeth
o
sawny
bean
s
bairns
they
wad
roast
your
ribs
fresh
and
fresh
till
they
were
done
syne
they
would
pickle
your
quarters
for
the
winter
the
like
o
you
wad
be
as
guid
as
a
christmas
mart
to
hoot
good
wife
said
i
ye
ken
that
a
this
talk
aboot
sawny
bean
s
folk
is
juist
to
fright
bairns
frae
gallivanting
at
ye
ll
maybe
get
news
o
that
gin
sawny
puts
his
knife
intil
your
throat
ye
hae
heard
o
my
man
james
bannatyne
is
not
a
man
easily
feared
but
not
for
the
earldom
o
cassillis
wad
he
gang
that
shore
road
to
ballantrae
his
and
indeed
there
were
in
the
countryside
enough
tales
of
wayfarers
who
had
disappeared
there
of
pools
of
blood
frozen
in
the
morning
of
traveller
s
footsteps
that
went
so
far
and
then
were
lost
in
a
smother
of
tracks
made
by
naked
feet
running
every
way
but
i
kept
on
with
my
questions
i
wanted
to
hear
the
bruit
of
the
country
and
what
were
our
chances
while
we
were
thus
cheerfully
talking
and
the
dominie
by
whiles
playing
a
spring
upon
his
pipes
to
gain
the
lady
s
goodwill
there
came
in
a
man
of
a
black
and
gruesome
countenance
we
knew
him
at
once
for
the
master
of
chapeldonnan
james
bannatyne
for
he
came
in
as
only
a
goodman
comes
into
his
own
house
he
was
a
man
renowned
for
his
great
strength
all
over
carrick
he
turned
on
us
a
lowering
regard
as
he
went
clumsily
by
into
an
inner
room
carrying
an
armful
of
nets
i
noted
that
the
twine
had
not
been
wet
so
that
his
sea
fishing
had
not
come
to
much
but
behind
the
door
he
flung
down
a
of
solan
geese
and
the
fowl
called
the
foolish
cock
of
the
rock
together
with
tammy
so
i
guessed
that
he
had
either
been
over
the
water
to
ailsa
or
desired
to
have
it
thought
so
his
wife
went
ben
the
room
to
him
we
could
hear
the
sulky
giant
s
growling
questions
as
to
who
we
were
and
his
wife
s
brisk
replies
presently
she
came
out
looking
a
little
dashed
james
has
come
in
raither
tired
she
said
and
he
will
need
to
lie
down
and
hae
a
in
that
case
mistress
i
said
we
will
e
en
thank
you
for
your
kindly
hospitality
and
take
our
she
followed
us
to
the
door
and
i
think
she
was
wonderfully
glad
to
get
us
safe
away
without
bloodshed
be
sure
that
ye
gang
na
south
by
the
benane
she
said
the
folk
that
bide
there
are
no
so
we
thanked
her
again
and
took
our
way
breathing
more
freely
also
to
have
left
the
giant
behind
we
had
not
gone
far
however
when
we
spied
her
husband
hastening
after
us
across
a
field
he
came
up
with
us
by
a
turn
in
the
road
we
harbour
no
spies
at
chapeldonnan
he
said
bending
sullenest
brows
at
us
and
that
i
would
have
you
we
are
no
spies
on
you
nor
on
any
man
i
said
we
are
honest
merchants
on
our
way
to
stranrawer
and
but
called
in
to
ask
the
ye
speered
ower
mony
questions
of
my
wife
to
be
honest
men
he
said
threateningly
and
why
said
the
dominie
birsing
up
as
one
that
is
ready
to
quarrel
in
this
realm
of
scotland
may
not
a
man
without
offence
ask
his
way
from
the
honest
wife
of
an
honest
man
so
long
as
he
soliciteth
no
favour
more
intimate
at
this
the
giant
made
a
blow
at
the
little
dominie
he
had
a
large
cudgel
in
his
hand
and
he
struck
without
warning
like
the
ruffian
that
he
was
but
he
fell
in
with
the
wrong
man
when
he
tried
to
take
dominie
mure
unawares
for
the
little
man
was
as
gleg
as
a
hawk
having
been
accustomed
to
watch
the
eyes
of
boys
all
his
life
ay
and
often
those
of
lads
bigger
than
himself
so
that
long
before
the
hulking
stroke
of
the
fellow
came
near
him
the
dominie
had
sprung
to
the
side
and
was
ready
with
his
whinger
in
his
hand
to
spit
bannatyne
upon
the
point
for
myself
i
did
not
even
think
it
worth
my
while
even
to
i
had
only
brought
my
plain
sword
fearing
that
in
some
of
the
company
which
on
our
wanderings
we
might
have
to
keep
the
earl
s
damascus
blade
might
overmuch
excite
cupidity
but
instead
i
ordered
the
fellow
away
as
one
that
has
authority
it
was
not
for
launcelot
kennedy
to
mix
himself
with
a
common
brawling
dog
like
chapeldonnan
it
wants
but
the
tickling
of
a
straw
cried
the
little
man
that
i
should
spit
you
through
like
a
paddock
to
bait
a
line
for
geds
and
but
for
your
wife
s
sake
who
is
a
woman
by
tied
to
a
ruffian
i
should
do
then
seeing
that
together
we
were
overstrong
for
him
james
bannatyne
took
himself
away
growling
curses
and
threatenings
as
to
what
should
happen
to
us
before
we
got
clear
of
carrick
however
we
took
little
heed
to
the
empty
boaster
but
went
our
ways
down
into
the
town
of
girvan
here
it
came
to
my
mind
to
hire
a
boat
and
provision
her
as
it
were
to
go
to
the
island
of
arran
and
nothing
would
set
me
till
i
had
it
done
so
on
the
south
beach
we
found
a
man
cleaning
just
such
a
boat
as
we
needed
with
a
on
her
and
a
little
mast
which
would
go
either
up
or
down
for
three
merks
in
silver
we
got
the
use
of
the
boat
for
a
month
and
with
her
both
suitable
oars
and
sails
he
was
going
to
the
haying
in
the
parish
of
colmonel
the
owner
said
but
lest
we
should
lose
her
we
must
deposit
with
the
minister
or
the
provost
of
the
town
other
thirty
merks
as
the
value
of
the
boat
which
money
should
again
be
ours
when
we
returned
to
claim
it
so
to
the
provost
we
went
whom
we
found
a
hearty
man
a
dealer
in
provisions
and
all
manner
of
victual
of
these
we
took
a
sufficient
cargo
on
board
and
having
paid
down
our
thirty
merks
early
one
morning
we
laid
our
course
for
the
isle
of
arran
but
when
we
had
gone
screeving
well
across
with
a
following
wind
we
lay
to
under
pladda
till
it
was
dusk
and
then
with
a
breeze
shifted
to
our
quarter
we
bore
down
on
ailsa
i
knew
not
very
well
what
we
should
find
there
but
i
judged
that
we
would
at
least
come
on
some
traces
of
the
murderous
crew
which
might
help
us
to
clear
up
some
of
their
secrets
for
i
judged
that
james
bannatyne
did
not
spend
his
nights
out
of
bed
in
order
to
wile
a
few
solan
geese
off
the
rocks
of
ailsa
defence
of
castle
now
the
isle
of
ailsa
is
little
more
than
a
great
lumping
crag
set
askew
in
the
sea
nevertheless
it
has
both
landing
place
and
pasturage
house
of
refuge
and
place
of
defence
the
island
was
not
new
to
me
for
i
had
once
upon
a
time
gone
thither
out
of
curiosity
after
the
matter
of
barclay
laird
of
in
his
madness
thought
to
make
it
a
place
of
arms
for
the
papists
in
the
year
of
the
spanish
armada
but
was
prevented
and
slain
at
the
instance
of
andrew
knox
one
of
the
good
reforming
name
minister
of
paisley
this
last
was
a
wonderfully
clever
man
and
accounted
a
moving
preacher
but
on
this
occasion
he
showed
himself
a
better
upon
craig
ailsa
at
least
is
more
to
the
purpose
it
was
the
dusk
of
the
morning
when
we
ran
into
the
spit
of
shingle
which
is
upon
the
eastern
side
and
watching
our
chance
we
drew
the
boat
ashore
the
sea
was
chill
and
calm
only
a
little
ruffled
by
the
night
wind
and
the
sun
was
already
brightening
the
sky
to
the
east
so
that
the
byne
hill
and
brown
carrick
stood
black
against
it
with
great
stealth
and
quiet
we
climbed
up
the
narrow
path
seeing
nothing
however
save
a
pasturing
goat
that
sprang
away
as
we
came
near
it
was
eerie
enough
work
for
the
seabirds
clanged
around
us
yammering
and
chunnering
querulously
among
themselves
on
the
main
cliffs
at
the
farther
side
of
the
isle
it
grew
a
little
lighter
when
we
came
out
upon
the
narrow
path
which
leads
to
the
castle
suddenly
the
dark
door
of
the
tower
loomed
before
us
very
black
and
grim
i
declare
it
was
like
marching
up
to
the
cannon
s
mouth
to
walk
up
that
little
flight
of
stairs
which
led
to
the
door
in
the
wall
nevertheless
i
clambered
first
with
a
curious
pricking
down
my
back
and
a
slackness
about
the
knees
so
all
unscathed
we
entered
there
was
only
emptiness
in
all
the
chambers
the
castle
had
been
almost
wholly
ruined
and
spoiled
for
since
its
taking
by
the
protestant
party
it
had
not
been
touched
nor
put
in
defence
now
i
will
bring
up
the
provender
keep
you
the
castle
said
i
to
the
little
dominie
as
soon
as
we
were
certified
that
we
were
first
in
possession
so
i
went
down
and
made
first
one
backload
and
then
another
of
those
things
which
we
had
bought
at
girvan
and
placed
in
the
boat
i
brought
up
also
all
the
ammunition
for
the
hackbutt
and
the
pistols
before
i
had
finished
the
sky
grew
grey
and
clear
the
day
breaking
nobly
with
only
a
rack
of
cloud
racing
up
the
far
side
of
kilbrannan
sound
to
hang
upon
the
chill
shark
s
teeth
of
the
mountains
of
arran
upon
my
return
i
was
glad
to
find
the
castle
intact
and
the
little
man
seated
calmly
with
a
book
in
his
hand
did
you
never
so
much
as
shut
the
outer
door
i
asked
him
and
shut
you
without
said
he
is
it
likely
ye
might
have
had
to
come
along
that
footpad
with
only
your
limber
legs
to
keep
your
tail
and
tam
o
drummurchie
or
sawny
bean
jumping
ahint
ye
so
before
we
went
to
examine
the
nooks
and
crannies
of
the
craig
either
for
enemies
or
treasure
boxes
we
resolved
to
put
the
castle
into
as
good
a
state
of
defence
as
we
could
first
we
drew
in
the
rough
wooden
steps
which
led
to
the
door
in
the
wall
by
which
we
had
entered
so
that
only
the
little
projections
whereon
the
wood
had
rested
were
left
to
afford
foothold
to
any
besieger
then
we
closed
and
barricaded
the
door
for
the
huge
iron
bolt
was
yet
in
its
place
and
ran
securely
into
the
stone
of
the
wall
itself
for
quite
two
feet
when
the
day
broke
fully
i
went
up
to
the
turret
top
to
look
about
me
save
us
i
cried
down
to
the
little
man
come
hither
dominie
is
not
that
our
boat
out
there
with
men
in
her
the
dominie
ran
up
and
looked
long
and
earnestly
ay
deed
is
it
that
he
made
answer
we
are
trapped
launcelot
for
all
our
cleverness
and
if
these
chiels
be
our
enemies
i
doubt
that
we
are
as
good
as
dead
men
in
the
jaws
of
the
wolf
of
drummurchie
the
men
in
the
boat
kept
leaning
back
and
looking
up
at
the
cliffs
as
if
to
get
sight
of
something
sometimes
they
went
completely
out
of
view
as
it
had
been
close
into
the
bulk
of
the
isle
mayhap
to
examine
more
carefully
some
cave
or
we
had
better
look
well
to
our
priming
and
set
a
watch
said
i
we
shall
have
visitors
this
day
at
castle
ailsa
or
my
name
is
not
launcelot
but
the
hours
passed
slowly
on
from
nine
till
noon
before
we
heard
a
sound
or
saw
a
living
creature
beside
the
geese
and
the
gulls
after
the
boat
had
gone
westward
out
of
sight
we
waxed
weary
at
our
posts
on
the
top
of
the
turret
i
went
down
to
look
at
the
cupboards
of
the
chambers
there
i
was
rooting
and
exploring
when
i
heard
the
dominie
whispering
loudly
to
me
to
run
up
hastily
into
the
tower
he
told
me
how
that
a
stone
had
come
pelting
against
the
wall
on
the
side
towards
the
hill
now
the
castle
sits
on
the
verge
of
the
precipice
and
only
a
narrow
path
leads
to
it
along
the
cliff
but
behind
there
is
a
little
courtyard
to
landward
now
mostly
ruined
and
broken
down
it
was
from
this
side
so
dominie
mure
whispered
to
me
that
the
stone
had
come
tut
man
said
i
you
are
losing
your
nerve
with
this
playing
of
it
was
but
a
s
foot
that
spurned
it
and
so
naturally
it
came
bumming
down
the
hill
then
he
replied
grimly
it
was
a
as
big
as
an
elephant
and
it
will
ding
over
this
castle
into
the
sea
for
no
ordinary
goat
could
have
stirred
the
stone
i
saw
i
tell
you
it
popped
over
the
heuch
like
a
but
we
were
soon
to
have
other
company
besides
that
of
the
stone
for
presently
there
came
in
sight
a
man
walking
daintily
and
carefully
along
the
path
which
led
to
the
door
of
the
tower
now
he
would
pull
wantonly
at
a
flower
and
anon
he
would
skip
a
stone
over
the
all
the
world
as
if
it
were
a
sabbath
afternoon
and
he
was
waiting
for
his
lass
but
i
knew
better
for
i
heard
his
harness
clattering
under
his
loose
coat
of
blue
where
gang
ye
so
blythe
my
bonny
man
cried
the
dominie
suddenly
from
my
elbow
the
man
started
back
and
set
his
hand
beneath
his
cloak
but
the
dominie
cried
keep
awa
your
hand
frae
your
hip
young
may
need
it
to
preserve
your
balance
on
the
give
me
your
attention
for
a
the
man
did
as
he
was
bid
and
cast
his
eye
aloft
where
the
black
mouth
of
a
hackbutt
looked
discouragingly
down
upon
him
your
name
friend
said
the
dominie
i
am
james
carrick
from
the
parish
of
barr
said
the
man
at
last
ay
ay
slee
s
man
said
the
dominie
with
meaning
when
the
man
is
pooin
gowans
and
skytin
slate
stanes
the
maister
is
no
that
far
awa
noo
james
e
en
turn

aboot
and
gang
your
ways
and
tell
your
maister
that
his
black
murder
is
found
out
and
that
there
are
those
on
their
way
to
this
isle
that
will
put
the
irons
on
his
so
the
man
who
had
called
himself
james
carrick
turned
obediently
about
and
marched
away
the
road
he
had
come
probably
he
had
been
sent
for
nothing
more
than
to
know
if
we
had
stolen
a
march
upon
them
and
taken
possession
of
the
strength
of
the
castle
they
had
our
was
no
question
of
that
we
were
therefore
set
here
with
only
two
backloads
of
powder
and
provisions
to
stand
a
siege
in
a
small
and
ruinous
tower
upon
a
barren
cliff
nor
was
it
long
before
we
had
news
of
the
enemy
for
as
we
strolled
up
and
down
the
battlement
walk
which
as
is
common
in
such
little
fortalices
went
round
three
sides
of
the
is
round
every
side
except
that
which
looks
inward
to
the
number
of
scattering
shots
came
from
all
about
but
chiefly
from
above
we
could
hear
them
whistling
over
us
as
we
ducked
our
heads
we
got
ready
our
guns
to
fire
in
return
so
soon
as
a
man
showed
but
the
many
bowders
and
rocky
humps
about
gave
the
enemy
great
shelter
so
that
it
was
no
easy
thing
to
take
aim
at
them
however
i
did
get
a
steady
shot
at
an
incautious
leg
and
on
the
back
of
the
crack
of
the
hackbutt
came
a
great
torrent
of
swearing
and
this
i
took
for
a
good
sign
all
we
could
do
was
to
keep
the
little
courtyard
clear
and
to
shoot
whenever
we
saw
a
bonnet
rise
up
or
a
limb
carelessly
exposed
but
we
both
yearned
for
something
more
lively
to
put
an
end
to
our
suspense
nor
had
we
long
to
wait
from
the
east
side
of
the
tower
which
looks
to
the
sea
there
came
the
sound
of
a
loud
report
a
tumble
of
stones
and
then
a
loud
continual
and
most
pitiful
crying
as
of
a
man
hurt
unto
death
i
ran
up
into
the
battlements
above
and
set
my
head
through
a
loophole
beneath
me
lay
a
young
man
with
his
red
bonnet
fallen
aside
clad
in
a
short
white
coat
with
doublet
and
hose
also
of
red
he
was
unarmed
so
far
as
i
could
see
who
are
you
and
what
brought
you
there
i
cried
to
him
from
the
turret
loop
a
massy
fallen
from
the
castle
lay
on
his
chest
and
a
pile
of
other
rocks
and
stones
was
heaped
about
his
legs
he
turned
his
eyes
upward
at
me
and
tried
twice
to
speak
at
last
he
said
with
many
pants
and
piteous
groans
i
am
allan
crosby
from
auchneil
i
brought
you
a
letter
from
my
lord
cassillis
i
landed
below
and
came
up
by
the
path
but
when
i
got
near
i
heard
firing
and
saw
the
door
shut
so
i
tried
to
clamber
up
the
castle
wall
to
cry
in
at
the
window
to
you
because
you
were
my
friends
and
even
as
i
climbed
the
stones
of
the
castle
fell
upon
me
and
now
they
are
crushing
the
life
out
of
where
is
the
letter
from
my
lord
said
i
the
man
cast
his
eyes
about
him
as
if
to
look
for
it
i
had
it
in
my
hand
just
now
he
said
i
saw
a
scrap
of
parchment
a
little
way
from
him
and
asked
if
that
were
the
letter
tie
it
to
a
cord
for
me
said
i
that
i
may
see
but
by
reason
of
his
wounds
he
was
not
able
to
reach
it
and
the
stones
pressed
so
bitterly
on
his
breast
that
he
could
do
nothing
but
lie
and
groan
most
waesomely
oh
help
me
or
else
end
my
the
love
of
god
he
cried
earnestly
for
i
am
at
the
point
of
death
in
this
i
went
all
round
the
top
of
the
tower
and
looked
about
every
way
our
enemies
had
retired
further
up
the
cliff
and
were
contenting
themselves
with
firing
an
occasional
shot
which
fell
harmless
against
the
walls
buzzed
among
the
battlements
or
else
sang
past
us
into
the
sea
i
called
the
dominie
come
to
the
door
said
i
i
can
not
bide
still
and
see
that
poor
man
suffer
he
says
that
he
has
come
with
a
letter
from
my
lord
cassillis
it
may
be
so
i
will
at
least
go
and
see
drummurchie
s
thieves
have
gone
up
the
face
of
the
rock
and
the
wounded
man
can
not
hurt
me
much
even
if
he
were
then
the
dominie
pled
with
me
to
bide
where
i
was
because
said
he
you
know
not
whether
it
be
not
an
i
can
not
let
a
be
crushed
to
pieces
before
my
eyes
and
abide
to
hear
his
i
answered
come
down
and
hold
you
the
door
so
with
that
i
undid
the
bolts
and
put
the
dominie
behind
it
i
set
my
feet
upon
the
jutting
stones
on
which
the
wooden
stair
usually
rested
and
so
scrambled
perilously
down
holding
on
to
the
wall
with
my
right
hand
the
while
when
i
came
to
him
the
lad
was
lying
gasping
on
his
back
with
the
stones
edgewise
on
his
breast
i
asked
him
how
he
did
he
seemed
past
speech
but
was
able
to
motion
me
round
to
the
further
side
there
i
stooped
gently
in
order
to
raise
the
great
block
that
lay
upon
his
bosom
i
stepped
carefully
about
and
turned
my
body
to
render
him
my
aid
as
tenderly
as
i
could
but
i
got
a
sudden
and
terrible
surprise
and
though
i
am
not
one
much
given
to
fear
i
own
that
it
shook
my
heart
even
as
i
stooped
over
him
the
fellow
flung
oft
the
stones
as
if
they
had
been
featherweights
leaped
upon
his
own
feet
with
a
bended
pistol
in
his
hand
and
stood
in
front
of
me
striding
across
the
path
which
led
back
again
to
the
castle
door
at
the
same
moment
i
heard
a
loud
shout
of
warning
from
the
dominie
that
the
enemy
were
again
coming
down
the
brae
i
had
no
time
to
draw
my
dagger
and
for
greater
lightness
i
had
left
my
sword
behind
i
saw
the
rascal
make
him
ready
to
fire
at
me
aiming
at
my
heart
so
i
remembered
a
french
trick
of
high
kicking
which
robert
harburgh
had
once
taught
me
for
he
had
been
in
france
at
the
schools
with
his
master
the
earl
and
had
learned
much
there
besides
philosophy
so
i
gave
the
fellow
my
foot
shod
with
full
upon
his
wrist
which
knocked
the
pistol
up
against
his
chin
with
a
stunning
crash
in
the
next
moment
i
leaped
at
his
throat
and
overbore
him
spurning
him
with
my
heel
as
i
passed
i
can
remember
leaping
upon
him
with
all
my
weight
from
the
top
of
one
of
the
very
stones
the
traitor
had
pulled
down
upon
himself
then
i
ran
for
the
entrance
of
the
castle
others
of
the
enemy
were
just
coming
about
the
corner
when
i
reached
the
projecting
points
of
stone
with
my
heart
in
my
mouth
i
sprang
up
the
little
juts
of
rock
i
was
almost
within
and
in
safety
but
i
had
not
counted
upon
the
swiftness
and
resource
of
my
gentleman
of
the
fallen
stone
he
was
hard
upon
my
heels
in
spite
of
the
thundering
clout
he
had
gotten
on
the
jaw
from
the
pistol
but
luckily
my
brave
little
friend
the
dominie
stood
ready
behind
the
door
and
as
soon
as
my
hindmost
foot
was
over
the
threshold
he
set
his
strength
to
the
iron
handle
and
sent
the
massy
oak
home
to
its
fastenings
with
such
force
that
it
struck
the
pursuer
fair
on
the
face
with
a
stunning
crash
as
a
stone
is
driven
from
a
sling
so
he
fell
whirling
over
the
stair
head
and
unable
to
stop
himself
he
went
gripping
vainly
at
the
headlong
over
the
cliff
this
however
being
behind
the
door
and
fully
employed
in
securing
it
we
did
not
know
at
the
time
but
when
we
hurried
again
to
the
top
of
the
tower
we
saw
the
enemy
swarming
down
the
cliff
side
to
render
him
some
assistance
or
it
might
be
to
recover
his
body
ask
him
when
you
get
him
if
he
has
another
letter
from
my
lord
the
earl
cried
the
dominie
after
them
and
serve
him
right
well
the
treacherous
hound
muttered
the
little
man
to
himself
if
you
find
him
in
pound
pieces
but
i
said
nothing
for
i
thought
the
fellow
would
mind
the
kick
that
i
gave
him
that
night
thomas
of
drummurchie
and
all
his
folk
removed
from
the
cave
where
till
now
they
had
dwelt
they
went
over
in
our
boat
and
in
that
of
james
bannatyne
of
chapeldonnan
to
the
mainland
being
frightened
as
i
guess
by
our
declaration
that
there
were
those
coming
who
would
deliver
them
to
justice
and
also
being
dismayed
as
i
make
no
doubt
by
our
staunch
and
desperate
defence
thus
were
we
left
alone
on
the
muckle
weary
rock
which
men
call
ailsa
and
which
thousands
of
free
men
and
women
look
at
every
day
without
a
thought
of
the
poor
prisoned
folk
upon
it
voice
out
of
the
now
so
long
as
provisions
last
ailsa
is
none
such
a
bad
sanctuary
and
we
might
have
passed
the
time
there
very
well
had
we
possessed
minds
sufficiently
at
ease
for
enjoying
such
a
hermitage
the
spring
was
but
a
few
yards
above
the
castle
and
it
ran
crystal
clear
into
a
little
basin
which
i
cut
in
the
rock
we
had
enough
victual
to
serve
us
for
a
month
with
the
provision
we
had
bought
in
girvan
and
with
what
i
shot
of
the
puffins
or
tammy
nories
which
ran
in
and
out
of
their
holes
all
day
like
conies
in
a
warren
sometimes
we
would
climb
to
the
top
of
the
crag
and
look
long
at
the
sea
which
from
there
seemed
like
a
great
sheet
hung
upon
cantyre
and
arran
on
the
one
side
and
upon
the
hills
of
galloway
and
carrick
on
the
ailsa
itself
on
which
we
were
sitting
in
the
deepest
trough
of
it
a
few
boats
crept
timidly
about
the
shore
and
a
little
ship
sometimes
passed
by
but
otherwise
we
had
for
companions
only
the
silly
guillemots
that
couped
their
tails
uppermost
and
dived
under
the
that
dropped
splash
into
the
water
and
the
solan
or
solemne
geese
which
when
they
fell
made
a
bigger
plunge
than
any
even
as
on
the
cliffs
of
the
island
their
keckling
and
crying
are
the
loudest
one
day
the
dominie
and
i
were
sitting
on
the
roof
of
all
things
as
the
summit
of
ailsa
seemed
to
be
picking
at
the
grasses
and
knuckling
little
stones
for
the
idlesse
which
comes
with
summer
weather
when
it
came
in
my
head
to
rally
robert
mure
because
he
had
a
cold
hearthstone
and
a
half
empty
bed
you
a
burgess
and
a
learned
man
with
an
official
rent
and
a
yearly
charge
on
the
burgh
yet
can
not
get
so
much
as
a
cotter
s
sonsy
bit
lass
to
keep
you
company
and
to
sit
canty
like
jenny
and
jock
on
the
far
side
of
the
chimbley
lug
think
shame
of
yourself
dominie
any
questing
lout
that
can
persuade
a
mall
of
the
byre
to
set
up
house
with
him
deserves
better
of
his
country
than
you
were
all
of
your
mind
maybole
school
might
have
none
to
attend
it
but
dotards
and
grandmothers
and
where
were
your
craft
then
socrates
i
asked
him
for
just
before
he
had
been
speaking
to
me
of
a
certain
wise
man
a
greek
of
that
name
and
at
first
he
made
a
jest
of
the
matter
as
indeed
i
meant
it
never
fear
he
said
there
will
always
be
enough
fools
in
ayrshire
to
get
more
maybole
shall
have
its
share
of
and
indeed
that
hath
been
the
repute
of
our
town
and
countryside
ever
since
ayr
water
first
ran
over
its
pebbles
yet
when
i
pressed
the
dominie
further
upon
the
matter
he
waxed
thoughtful
his
face
which
was
not
naturally
merry
took
on
a
still
sterner
expression
presently
he
put
his
hand
within
his
blouse
and
pulled
out
a
little
string
of
beads
such
as
catholics
wear
to
mind
them
of
their
prayers
it
was
suspended
about
his
neck
this
i
own
was
a
great
marvel
to
me
for
the
dominie
was
a
strong
reformer
and
showed
little
mercy
in
arguing
with
men
still
inclined
to
the
ancient
opinion
he
gave
the
brown
rosary
into
my
hand
and
i
turned
it
curiously
about
it
was
made
of
the
stones
of
some
foreign
fruit
most
quaintly
and
fantastically
carven
and
joined
together
with
little
links
of
gold
between
two
of
the
beads
there
was
a
longer
portion
of
the
chain
and
upon
it
two
rings
of
gold
were
strung
once
said
the
dominie
there
was
a
maid
who
had
promised
to
share
my
hearth
one
ring
of
these
two
was
mine
to
wear
upon
my
finger
and
one
was
hers
upon
the
night
before
our
marriage
day
we
met
at
our
place
of
tryst
i
tried
the
ring
upon
her
finger
ard
wished
her
to
wear
it
that
night
will
is
not
so
far
away
she
said
and
slipped
from
my
arms
under
a
moon
she
went
homeward
singing
by
the
heads
of
benane
and
that
was
the
last
that
these
eyes
ever
beheld
of
bonny
mary
only
this
necklace
of
beads
which
she
wore
and
the
stain
of
her
blood
upon
the
short
grass
of
the
the
dominie
looked
long
to
seaward
at
the
flashing
birds
that
circled
and
clanged
about
our
rocky
isle
each
tribe
of
them
following
its
own
orbit
and
keeping
to
its
own
airy
sphere
and
what
happened
to
her
i
began
but
got
no
further
murder
most
foul
he
cried
rising
to
his
feet
in
his
agitation
horrible
unheard
of
in
any
kingdom
for
all
about
the
spot
where
these
things
were
found
was
the
trampling
of
many
naked
feet
and
some
of
these
were
small
and
some
were
great
but
all
were
naked
and
the
print
of
every
foot
was
plain
upon
the
sand
of
the
shore
each
footprint
had
the
toes
of
the
bare
feet
wide
and
distinct
every
toe
was
pointed
with
a
claw
as
though
the
steads
were
those
of
birds
and
the
fearsome
went
down
to
the
sea
edge
and
the
blood
marks
followed
them
and
that
was
then
the
dominie
fell
silent
and
i
also
for
though
ayrshire
was
full
of
blood
feuds
and
the
quest
of
human
life
this
was
a
new
kind
of
murder
to
by
all
accounts
it
seemed
not
rare
in
the
neighbourhood
of
benane
for
i
minded
the
warning
words
of
the
mistress
of
chapeldonnan
and
had
she
no
enemies
this
mary
torrance
i
asked
she
was
but
young
and
of
birth
too
lowly
for
feuds
and
fightings
besides
who
in
carrick
would
harm
a
maid
going
homeward
from
her
the
dominie
rose
and
walked
away
to
the
other
side
of
the
rock
of
ailsa
where
for
long
he
sat
by
himself
and
fingered
the
necklace
of
beads
his
face
was
fixed
as
if
he
were
making
of
the
rosary
a
very
catena
of
hate
a
receptacle
of
dark
imaginings
and
vengeful
vows
scarcely
could
i
recognise
my
quaint
and
friendly
dominie
it
was
that
night
as
the
blackness
grew
grey
towards
the
morn
that
i
yielded
my
watch
upon
the
roof
of
the
little
castle
of
ailsa
to
the
dominie
too
long
i
had
paced
the
battlements
listening
to
the
confused
and
belated
yawping
and
crying
of
the
upon
the
ledges
and
to
the
mysterious
night
sounds
of
the
isle
for
i
began
to
hear
and
to
see
all
manner
of
uncouth
things
that
have
no
existence
except
on
the
borderlands
of
sleep
the
dominie
said
no
word
good
or
bad
but
drew
his
cloak
about
him
and
sat
down
on
the
rampart
i
bade
him
good
morning
but
he
never
answered
me
a
word
and
so
i
left
him
for
i
judged
that
his
thought
was
bitter
and
that
the
tale
he
had
told
me
of
mary
torrance
lay
blackly
upon
him
yet
when
i
went
below
it
was
not
with
me
as
on
other
mornings
i
lay
down
upon
the
plaids
and
composed
me
to
sleep
yet
i
remained
broad
awake
which
was
an
unaccountable
thing
for
me
who
have
been
all
my
life
a
great
sleeper
i
lay
and
thought
of
my
friend
sitting
gloomy
and
silent
above
in
the
greyness
of
morn
till
my
own
meditations
grew
eerie
and
comfortless
often
and
often
i
started
upon
my
elbow
with
the
intention
of
going
to
him
as
often
i
lay
down
again
because
i
had
no
excuse
and
also
as
it
seemed
to
me
he
had
not
desired
my
company
but
once
as
i
lifted
me
up
on
my
elbow
i
seemed
to
hear
a
shrill
crying
as
it
had
been
out
of
the
sea
kennedy
it
said
and
the
crying
was
most
like
a
woman
s
voice
my
very
blood
chilled
within
me
for
the
tale
of
the
lass
murdered
upon
the
morn
of
her
marriage
day
was
yet
in
my
mind
and
i
thought
of
naught
less
than
that
her
uneasy
spirit
was
now
come
to
visit
the
man
aged
and
withered
who
sat
up
there
waiting
and
watching
for
her
coming
yet
why
it
should
cry
my
name
passed
my
comprehension
it
was
therefore
small
wonder
that
i
listened
long
lying
there
among
the
plaids
upon
the
floor
but
the
night
wind
soughed
and
sobbed
through
the
narrow
wicket
window
and
there
was
no
further
noise
thinking
that
i
had
dreamed
i
laid
my
head
upon
the
hard
pillow
and
composed
me
to
sleep
but
even
then
i
caught
as
it
had
been
the
regular
beat
of
a
boat
s
oars
upon
the
rullocks
and
anon
i
heard
my
name
cried
twice
and
thrice
launcelot
kennedy
launcelot
kennedy
launcelot
kennedy
whereat
with
a
thrill
of
horror
i
rose
cast
the
wrappings
from
me
and
with
my
naked
sword
in
my
hand
i
went
up
to
the
roof
of
the
castle
the
dominie
was
sitting
with
his
face
turned
seaward
he
heard
me
come
behind
him
without
turning
he
put
out
his
hand
did
you
hear
it
too
he
said
go
below
that
which
shall
come
is
not
for
your
eyes
to
see
but
i
heard
a
woman
call
my
name
i
said
i
heard
it
twice
and
thrice
plain
as
i
hear
you
speak
nay
he
said
not
your
and
once
more
we
listened
together
as
for
me
i
strained
my
eyes
into
the
darkness
so
that
they
ached
and
were
ready
to
behold
anything
i
gazed
out
directly
towards
the
sea
from
which
the
sounds
had
come
but
the
dominie
looked
along
the
path
which
led
precariously
between
the
wall
of
the
isle
above
and
the
precipice
below
thus
we
watched
as
it
seemed
for
hours
and
hours
suddenly
i
heard
him
draw
in
his
breath
with
a
gasping
sound
like
that
which
a
man
gives
when
he
finds
himself
unexpectedly
in
water
the
twilight
of
the
morning
had
come
a
little
and
as
i
looked
over
his
shoulder
lo
there
seemed
to
me
as
it
had
been
a
maid
in
white
coming
along
the
path
i
felt
my
heart
stop
beating
and
i
too
gazed
rigidly
for
it
seemed
to
me
to
be
nell
kennedy
coming
towards
us
robed
like
an
angel
she
is
dead
i
thought
mayhap
the
clawed
things
out
of
the
sea
have
devoured
her
even
as
they
took
mary
torrance
but
i
heard
the
dominie
say
under
his
breath
it
is
she
it
is
she
for
in
the
moment
of
terror
when
the
soul
is
unmanned
everyone
hears
with
his
own
ears
and
sees
with
his
own
eyes
according
to
his
own
heart
s
fantasy
but
the
figure
came
ever
closer
to
us
stepping
daintily
and
surely
in
the
dim
light
again
i
heard
the
voice
which
had
spoken
to
me
from
the
sea
and
at
the
sound
my
very
bones
quaked
within
me
kennedy
it
said
and
for
a
long
moment
the
figure
stood
still
as
if
waiting
for
an
answer
but
my
voice
was
shut
dumbly
within
me
the
dominie
stood
up
art
thou
the
spirit
of
mary
torrance
or
a
deceiving
fiend
of
hell
that
has
taken
her
shape
answer
me
or
i
fire
and
the
dominie
held
out
his
pistol
to
the
ghost
which
even
then
appeared
to
me
a
mightily
vain
thing
for
how
can
a
spirit
fear
these
things
which
are
only
deadly
to
flesh
and
bone
i
have
come
to
see
launcelot
kennedy
answered
the
voice
and
it
appeared
awful
and
terrible
to
me
beyond
the
power
of
words
i
could
not
so
much
as
fix
my
mind
on
a
prayer
though
i
knew
several
well
enough
i
have
come
to
seek
launce
kennedy
is
he
within
said
the
voice
what
would
you
with
him
he
is
no
concern
of
yours
said
the
dominie
i
ken
that
said
the
voice
nevertheless
i
have
come
to
seek
him
i
greet
you
well
dominie
mure
will
you
open
and
let
helen
kennedy
within
and
with
that
the
light
came
clearer
the
veil
of
the
fantasies
of
that
fearful
night
fell
like
a
loosened
bandage
from
my
eyes
and
lo
there
at
the
tower
s
foot
was
my
dear
quipsome
lass
nell
kennedy
in
her
own
proper
body
and
i
knew
her
for
good
sound
flesh
and
blood
nor
could
i
now
tell
how
i
had
so
deceived
myself
but
one
thing
i
i
should
not
reveal
my
terror
to
her
for
very
certainly
she
would
laugh
at
me
but
the
dominie
was
too
firmly
fixed
in
his
thought
i
saw
him
grip
his
pistol
and
lean
over
the
parapet
it
seemed
that
he
could
not
even
believe
the
seeing
of
his
eyes
come
not
nearer
he
cried
in
a
wild
voice
for
well
do
i
know
that
you
are
a
fiend
of
the
breed
of
the
sea
demons
whatsoever
you
may
pretend
i
will
try
a
bullet
of
holy
silver
upon
but
i
threw
myself
upon
him
and
held
his
arm
it
is
but
our
own
nell
kennedy
i
said
what
frights
you
dominie
for
i
resolved
to
make
a
virtue
of
my
courage
and
indeed
as
i
came
to
myself
first
and
had
done
no
open
foolishness
i
thought
i
might
as
well
take
all
the
credit
which
was
due
to
me
see
you
not
that
it
is
only
helen
kennedy
of
culzean
i
repeated
reasoning
with
him
and
what
seeks
she
with
you
said
he
still
struggling
in
my
grasp
i
tell
you
it
is
a
prodigy
and
bodes
us
no
good
he
persisted
that
i
can
not
tell
said
i
i
had
thought
her
safe
upon
the
moors
with
my
mother
but
i
will
go
down
and
open
the
door
to
so
when
i
had
run
down
the
stairs
of
the
small
keep
and
set
the
bolt
wide
lo
there
upon
the
step
was
nell
kennedy
her
face
dimpled
with
smiles
albeit
somewhat
pale
also
with
the
morning
light
and
the
strangeness
of
her
adventure
i
held
out
my
hand
to
her
never
had
i
been
so
moved
with
any
meeting
nell
i
said
and
could
say
no
more
ay
nell
she
said
and
she
came
in
without
taking
my
hand
but
for
all
that
she
was
not
abashed
nor
but
she
remained
as
direct
and
simple
in
her
demeanour
as
she
had
been
about
culzean
in
the
old
days
before
sorrow
fell
upon
the
house
and
indeed
upon
us
all
take
me
up
the
stairs
to
the
dominie
she
said
and
i
took
her
hand
and
kept
it
tightly
as
we
went
upwards
but
i
tried
after
no
greater
favours
at
that
time
for
i
knew
that
her
mood
leaned
not
towards
the
desires
of
a
lover
ah
dominie
said
nell
when
she
reached
the
top
this
ailsa
is
a
strange
place
to
keep
school
in
yet
i
warrant
you
that
geese
are
not
more
numerous
here
than
they
were
in
maybole
but
the
dominie
could
only
gaze
at
her
thus
daffing
with
him
so
fixed
had
he
been
in
his
fantasy
then
when
he
was
somewhat
come
to
himself
we
waited
expectantly
for
nell
to
reveal
her
errand
and
to
relate
her
adventure
and
she
did
not
keep
us
long
waiting
you
must
instantly
leave
ailsa
and
come
back
with
me
she
said
my
sister
marjorie
is
lost
from
auchendrayne
and
we
three
must
find
her
i
fear
that
the
mures
have
done
her
a
mischief
being
afraid
of
the
things
that
she
might
how
knew
you
of
that
nelly
i
asked
for
indeed
it
was
a
thing
i
could
make
no
guess
at
myself
it
was
one
morning
at
kirrieoch
said
nell
as
we
were
bringing
in
the
kye
out
of
the
green
pastures
by
the
waterside
that
a
messenger
rode
up
with
a
letter
from
marjorie
she
asked
me
to
meet
her
at
culzean
and
to
bring
you
and
any
other
faithful
men
whom
i
could
trust
along
with
me
and
thus
the
letter
ended
gin
i
once
win
clear
out
of
auchendrayne
we
have
them
all
in
the
hollow
of
our
hand
i
have
found
him
that
carried
the
she
means
the
letter
to
john
mure
that
took
your
father
to
the
tryst
of
death
i
said
the
dominie
seemed
to
awake
at
the
words
that
will
be
young
william
dalrymple
she
has
fallen
on
with
he
cried
in
much
excitement
i
rose
and
hastened
down
to
put
our
belongings
together
which
were
scattered
about
the
castle
as
soon
as
i
returned
nell
went
on
with
her
tale
then
because
i
knew
not
where
you
were
she
said
i
was
in
much
distress
but
your
father
donned
his
war
graith
and
rode
with
me
to
the
house
of
culzean
where
he
yet
abides
as
for
me
i
could
noways
rest
so
i
set
myself
to
trace
you
and
here
i
have
found
you
pray
god
we
may
find
our
marjorie
as
safely
but
how
did
you
manage
to
trace
us
i
asked
for
the
dominie
and
i
thought
that
we
had
well
hidden
our
tracks
oh
i
got
the
kindly
side
of
the
goodwife
of
chapeldonnan
said
nell
lightly
and
when
i
heard
that
i
did
not
wonder
any
more
for
she
could
get
the
kindly
side
of
anyone
if
so
she
chose
because
nell
kennedy
in
spite
of
her
taunting
and
teasing
had
ever
a
coaxing
winsome
way
with
her
which
was
vastly
taking
then
we
fell
to
making
our
plans
it
would
not
do
for
us
to
be
seen
leaving
the
craig
by
day
for
our
position
was
plainly
in
view
of
keen
eyes
along
all
the
girvan
shore
and
at
chapeldonnan
or
girvanmains
as
well
and
worse
enemies
than
these
might
put
out
a
dozen
boats
to
intercept
us
or
simply
lie
in
wait
to
take
us
as
we
landed
besides
all
this
day
and
part
of
the
night
there
befel
a
storm
which
lashed
the
waves
to
white
foam
about
our
abode
with
more
than
a
woman
s
ordinary
forethought
in
adventure
nell
had
left
her
boat
in
a
cove
to
the
right
of
the
and
indeed
i
that
somewhat
prided
myself
upon
my
wisdom
had
not
taken
as
great
precautions
among
other
things
was
the
cause
of
our
present
position
on
the
craig
so
we
three
spent
all
the
day
in
cheerful
talk
thinking
that
so
soon
as
we
could
find
marjorie
we
should
come
to
the
end
of
our
perplexities
and
have
the
guilty
in
our
power
but
in
this
we
spoke
without
knowledge
of
the
manifold
shifts
and
stratagems
of
our
arch
enemy
rescue
from
the
while
we
thus
waited
and
planned
nell
told
us
how
that
she
had
remained
at
culzean
till
there
seemed
no
more
hope
of
marjorie
s
coming
then
there
arrived
a
lass
of
the
cochranes
who
had
been
marjorie
s
tiring
maid
at
auchendrayne
from
her
nell
learned
how
after
a
fierce
and
bitter
scene
with
the
elder
mure
marjorie
had
fled
from
auchendrayne
none
knew
whither
escaping
all
their
toils
and
passing
their
inner
and
outer
guard
under
silence
of
night
then
so
soon
as
she
had
heard
this
fearing
all
evil
to
her
sister
nell
set
out
to
find
that
in
the
absence
of
any
hope
of
help
from
her
brothers
i
might
aid
her
to
find
her
sister
and
to
clear
some
of
the
ever
deepening
mysteries
it
was
the
dusk
of
an
evening
sweet
and
debonnair
when
we
left
the
castle
which
had
been
so
long
our
home
and
descended
the
perilous
steeps
to
the
foot
of
ailsa
here
we
found
nell
s
boat
safe
in
its
cove
and
immediately
we
pushed
out
having
placed
therein
all
our
weapons
and
belongings
nell
sat
in
the
stern
and
the
dominie
and
i
took
the
oars
the
storm
of
the
night
and
morning
had
abated
and
there
was
now
no
more
than
an
oily
swell
upon
the
water
there
was
little
talk
between
us
as
we
went
for
we
felt
that
our
lives
were
in
our
hands
and
that
we
might
be
only
running
into
greater
perils
i
supposed
that
the
dominie
was
thinking
of
the
love
he
had
lost
by
black
unnatural
murder
on
that
dangerous
shore
to
which
we
were
making
our
way
we
kept
well
to
the
south
of
girvan
because
i
had
twice
gone
there
on
errands
which
did
not
tend
to
make
us
favourites
with
the
bargany
kennedies
and
their
supporters
of
whom
the
townsfolk
were
mostly
composed
besides
i
remembered
the
word
of
the
rascal
whom
i
had
held
at
my
mercy
in
the
house
of
mistress
allison
the
grieve
s
wife
at
culzean
the
treasure
of
kelwood
is
in
the
cave
of
sawny
bean
on
the
shore
of
bennanbrack
over
against
and
this
though
not
a
clear
direction
pointed
to
some
promontory
south
of
girvan
and
north
of
ballantrae
and
though
the
discovery
of
my
master
s
death
was
i
trust
first
in
my
mind
i
need
not
deny
that
i
was
also
mindful
of
the
treasure
for
which
so
much
had
been
adventured
first
and
last
it
was
a
high
tide
and
a
calm
sea
when
we
got
over
into
the
loom
of
the
cliffs
we
had
a
making
wind
and
the
tide
was
with
us
so
that
we
had
been
able
to
set
the
sail
part
of
the
a
little
mast
which
would
carry
a
lug
sail
lay
snugly
under
the
thwarts
of
the
boat
the
dominie
who
in
his
rambling
youth
had
followed
the
sea
both
steered
and
managed
the
sheet
as
we
drew
nearer
the
shore
while
i
lay
over
the
bow
and
kept
a
ahead
we
steered
towards
a
light
which
went
wavering
along
the
top
of
the
rocks
for
we
opined
that
it
must
be
some
shepherd
wandering
with
a
lantern
to
look
for
a
lost
sheep
now
it
dipped
into
clefts
now
it
mounted
to
the
summit
of
the
crags
and
anon
it
was
lost
again
behind
the
screes
and
tumbled
cliffs
of
the
coast
suddenly
from
high
above
us
where
we
had
last
seen
the
light
we
heard
sounds
as
of
pain
and
woman
s
cry
in
her
weeping
or
beseeching
but
crying
only
being
as
it
seemed
utterly
in
distress
tis
our
marjorie
i
ken
her
voice
cried
nell
and
we
all
strained
our
eyes
upwards
to
the
dark
heuchs
the
lantern
had
come
to
a
standstill
almost
directly
above
us
the
dominie
silently
took
down
the
mast
and
let
it
rest
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
our
speed
slackened
till
we
floated
without
motion
on
the
gently
heaving
water
i
continued
to
peer
into
the
gloom
yet
how
marjorie
kennedy
could
have
come
to
be
in
danger
upon
the
shore
of
benane
was
far
beyond
my
comprehending
at
that
time
marjorie
sister
marjorie
cried
nell
as
loudly
as
she
could
and
almost
as
she
spoke
i
saw
something
white
descending
towards
us
from
the
cliff
like
a
poised
bird
that
closes
its
pinions
and
dives
into
the
water
the
smitten
waters
sprang
up
white
not
twenty
feet
from
our
bows
i
stood
erect
on
the
stern
scarce
knowing
what
might
hap
yet
to
be
ready
for
anything
balancing
on
both
feet
for
a
spring
and
as
soon
as
i
had
a
glimpse
of
something
white
which
rose
from
the
black
water
i
sprang
towards
it
ere
it
had
time
to
sink
again
for
nell
was
with
me
in
the
boat
and
it
was
my
opportunity
to
let
her
see
that
launce
kennedy
did
not
do
all
his
deeds
standing
on
the
solid
land
i
declare
so
much
was
i
affected
and
worked
upon
by
her
crying
to
her
sister
that
had
it
been
sawny
bean
himself
i
had
grappled
with
him
there
in
the
salt
water
but
it
was
a
braver
weight
and
shape
that
i
held
in
my
the
slim
form
of
a
woman
i
felt
a
thrill
run
through
me
when
i
found
that
her
arms
had
been
tied
closely
behind
her
back
both
at
wrist
and
elbow
nevertheless
i
gripped
the
cords
which
confined
her
and
struck
out
for
the
boat
which
i
saw
black
like
a
rock
above
me
it
was
no
more
than
a
minute
that
i
supported
the
girl
in
the
water
but
to
me
it
seemed
to
be
a
year
for
i
was
hill
born
and
had
learned
the
swimming
since
i
came
in
my
youth
to
culzean
and
this
never
makes
a
strong
nor
yet
a
long
swimmer
like
the
boy
who
has
been
half
in
and
half
out
of
the
tide
all
day
long
every
summer
season
since
he
could
walk
but
the
dominie
speedily
brought
the
boat
about
for
indeed
there
was
little
way
on
her
at
anyrate
in
a
moment
more
his
strong
hands
and
long
fingers
were
lifting
marjorie
kennedy
on
board
and
laying
her
all
wet
as
she
was
in
the
arms
of
her
sister
nell
then
he
gave
me
a
hand
over
the
bow
and
we
cowered
low
in
the
boat
letting
her
drift
inward
with
the
tide
till
we
were
close
under
the
loom
of
the
land
and
in
the
very
darkest
of
the
shadow
we
knew
well
that
they
who
had
tied
marjorie
s
hands
would
be
on
the
for
her
rescuers
so
on
the
black
water
we
lay
and
waited
nor
had
we
long
to
wait
for
in
a
short
time
voices
echoed
here
and
there
among
the
rocks
and
the
lantern
with
others
which
we
had
not
previously
seen
appeared
far
down
near
the
edge
of
the
sea
at
the
same
time
from
the
other
direction
came
the
noise
of
oars
roughly
thrown
into
a
boat
and
the
clambering
of
men
over
the
side
then
we
were
indeed
in
sore
jeopardy
for
the
wind
had
died
to
nothing
under
the
land
and
the
grey
sea
lay
outside
the
shadow
of
the
cliffs
with
quite
enough
light
upon
it
to
trace
us
by
if
we
rowed
out
in
that
direction
and
all
the
while
marjorie
lay
silent
in
her
sister
s
arms
i
had
cut
the
cords
and
chafed
her
hands
as
well
as
i
could
but
still
she
did
not
speak
the
pursuers
closed
rapidly
upon
us
from
both
sides
and
ere
we
could
think
of
a
plan
we
saw
the
boats
pushing
out
with
torches
held
at
their
prows
by
the
hands
of
dark
and
stalwart
men
and
then
the
dominie
and
i
looked
to
our
pistols
and
swords
resolving
if
it
came
to
the
sharp
pinch
to
make
a
good
fight
for
it
for
when
the
two
boats
came
together
they
could
not
choose
but
find
us
cleft
in
the
let
us
get
in
nearer
to
the
land
said
the
dominie
tis
the
sole
chance
that
remains
to
so
seizing
each
of
us
an
oar
the
sea
being
perfectly
calm
and
a
full
tide
lapsing
as
smoothly
upon
the
cliffs
as
the
water
in
a
tub
wherein
good
wives
wash
their
duds
we
risked
the
matter
and
rowed
in
closer
to
the
rock
we
sought
if
by
good
chance
there
might
be
found
some
inlet
where
we
could
land
or
some
cave
which
might
conceal
us
from
the
cruel
men
who
were
seeking
our
lives
nor
was
our
adventuring
in
vain
for
as
we
cautiously
advanced
into
the
blackness
the
wall
of
the
cliff
seemed
to
retire
before
us
so
that
the
prow
of
the
boat
actually
appeared
to
push
it
steadily
back
a
denser
darkness
a
very
night
of
egypt
surrounded
us
gradually
the
noise
of
the
pursuers
dulled
sank
and
died
away
we
lost
sight
of
the
grey
uneasy
plain
of
the
sea
behind
us
and
continued
to
advance
through
a
long
water
passage
walled
with
rock
the
sides
of
which
we
could
sometimes
feel
with
our
hands
and
sometimes
fail
to
touch
with
our
oars
this
i
took
at
the
time
to
be
a
marvellous
dispensation
of
providence
on
our
behalf
as
without
doubt
it
was
but
now
we
know
that
all
that
shoreward
country
owing
to
the
abundance
of
soft
stone
by
the
seaside
is
honeycombed
with
caves
so
that
it
was
impossible
to
miss
at
least
one
of
these
in
every
half
mile
of
cliff
all
about
the
heads
of
benerard
yet
that
we
should
strike
this
one
of
all
others
appeared
a
thing
worthy
of
admiration
as
presently
you
shall
hear
and
showed
the
same
dispensing
and
favourable
providence
which
has
throughout
been
on
the
side
of
culzean
and
against
our
enemies
of
bargany
marjorie
and
nell
still
sat
together
in
the
stern
but
so
dense
was
the
dark
that
we
could
see
nothing
of
them
the
dominie
and
i
took
our
oars
from
the
rullocks
and
pushed
onward
into
the
cave
hoping
to
come
in
time
to
some
wider
space
where
we
could
either
disembark
or
find
a
passage
out
upon
the
land
above
us
and
so
presently
we
came
to
a
place
wonderful
enough
in
itself
yet
no
more
than
the
gateway
to
other
and
greater
marvels
the
waves
which
had
scarcely
been
visible
out
on
the
open
sea
ran
into
the
cave
at
regular
intervals
and
in
the
narrow
places
formed
themselves
into
a
considerable
swell
of
water
before
us
we
could
hear
them
break
with
a
noise
like
thunder
upon
some
hidden
strand
or
beach
this
somewhat
terrified
us
in
that
place
of
horrid
darkness
for
the
noise
was
loud
as
is
a
waterfall
in
the
time
of
spate
the
echoing
of
the
cave
and
the
many
contracted
passages
and
wide
halls
deceiving
the
ear
so
our
boat
being
poised
upon
the
crest
of
one
of
these
smooth
steeps
of
water
which
rolled
onward
into
the
cave
advanced
swiftly
into
a
more
spacious
cavern
where
the
oar
could
be
used
without
touching
the
rock
at
either
side
the
sounds
now
came
back
to
us
also
from
high
aloft
and
we
had
the
feeling
of
much
air
and
a
certain
spacious
vastness
above
us
yet
the
imprisoning
darkness
confused
with
the
lashing
of
the
waves
wrought
a
kind
of
invincible
melancholy
which
weighed
down
all
our
spirits
presently
however
the
prow
of
the
boat
took
the
slushy
sand
in
a
coign
more
retired
where
the
waves
did
not
as
in
other
places
fall
with
an
arching
dash
but
rather
lapsed
with
a
gentler
wash
as
upon
a
regular
beach
being
in
the
bow
i
lost
no
time
in
leaping
ashore
and
in
a
few
moments
i
had
the
boat
fast
to
a
natural
pier
of
rock
behind
which
the
water
was
quiet
as
in
a
mill
pond
here
in
the
darkness
we
helped
each
other
out
and
feeling
ourselves
now
somewhat
more
safe
from
our
enemies
we
shook
one
another
by
the
hand
and
made
many
congratulation
on
our
escape
which
had
indeed
been
marvellous
even
thus
we
waited
for
the
day
to
reveal
to
us
whether
there
were
any
passage
by
which
we
could
ascend
from
the
deeps
of
the
cimmerian
pit
wherein
we
were
enclosed
without
adventuring
out
again
in
our
boat
upon
the
water
where
our
enemies
watched
for
us
we
drew
close
together
upon
the
rocky
pier
and
marjorie
told
us
of
her
escape
from
the
auchendraynes
the
strange
tale
of
which
shall
hereafter
be
given
at
length
in
its
own
place
also
she
confirmed
the
message
which
she
had
sent
to
her
sister
that
she
had
discovered
all
the
wickedness
and
certain
guilt
of
the
mures
in
the
death
of
her
father
and
in
many
other
crimes
so
we
saw
before
us
in
plain
case
their
condemnation
if
once
we
could
escape
from
this
snare
and
bring
their
iniquity
to
light
before
the
king
and
the
council
yet
all
the
while
it
was
a
marvel
to
me
how
marjorie
had
so
completely
forgotten
james
mure
the
younger
who
was
her
wedded
husband
even
though
she
had
never
rendered
to
him
the
love
and
duty
of
a
wife
but
we
were
by
no
means
yet
won
out
of
the
wood
and
at
the
best
our
case
was
not
a
particularly
comfortable
one
the
dominie
and
i
had
indeed
provided
marjorie
with
such
wrappings
and
covertures
as
were
in
our
power
which
we
had
brought
with
us
from
the
isle
but
we
had
mainly
to
trust
to
the
virtues
of
the
strong
waters
of
france
which
the
dominie
always
carried
about
with
him
as
well
as
to
the
mildness
of
the
night
that
she
should
take
no
harm
from
her
fearful
plunge
from
the
cliffs
into
the
salt
water
but
it
is
certain
that
the
perturbation
of
one
s
spirit
at
such
a
time
is
so
great
that
many
things
pass
without
penalty
to
the
health
which
at
another
season
might
induce
disease
and
death
presently
we
found
that
our
boat
was
being
left
high
and
dry
the
water
ebbing
swiftly
away
from
us
towards
the
mouth
of
the
cave
we
had
as
it
happened
entered
at
the
height
of
the
tide
and
now
the
water
was
upon
the
turn
but
this
affected
us
little
for
we
judged
that
either
it
would
go
so
far
back
that
we
might
find
a
way
of
escape
by
clambering
over
the
rocks
out
upon
the
land
or
else
at
the
worst
we
knew
that
by
waiting
till
the
next
tide
we
should
be
able
to
return
the
way
we
had
come
at
all
events
for
that
time
at
least
we
thought
ourselves
to
have
outwitted
our
pursuers
and
to
stand
no
longer
in
their
danger
but
we
were
briskly
to
learn
another
way
of
it
for
the
oftenest
slip
is
made
upon
the
threshold
of
safety
marjorie
and
nell
bore
themselves
through
all
these
dangers
and
discomforts
with
the
greatest
courage
never
had
this
come
home
to
me
so
strongly
before
for
the
maid
s
shamefacedness
had
died
out
of
marjorie
kennedy
and
now
she
seemed
wholly
set
with
a
fierce
jealousy
of
hate
to
compass
the
punishment
of
her
father
s
enemies
the
water
being
in
this
manner
retired
and
our
boat
lying
high
and
dry
upon
a
shelving
beach
i
proposed
that
the
dominie
and
myself
should
attempt
some
exploration
of
the
place
where
we
found
we
left
nell
and
her
sister
by
the
boat
to
make
such
dispositions
of
their
cleading
as
would
countervale
the
discomfort
of
marjorie
s
rescue
from
death
so
the
dominie
and
i
felt
with
our
hands
all
round
the
wide
amphitheatre
which
had
so
lately
been
filled
with
the
salt
water
we
had
no
difficulty
in
discovering
the
narrow
passage
by
which
we
had
come
for
down
its
narrow
gullet
the
water
was
now
retreating
with
great
swiftness
but
we
seemed
to
be
at
the
sack
s
end
in
every
other
way
so
that
we
looked
for
nothing
else
but
having
to
return
to
the
same
place
and
in
the
same
way
by
which
we
came
after
our
enemies
had
retired
so
swiftly
did
the
tide
run
back
that
it
seemed
as
if
it
might
be
possible
for
us
to
walk
out
upon
our
own
feet
and
so
indeed
we
did
but
in
a
very
strange
fashion
for
in
one
of
my
gropings
i
came
upon
a
projection
of
the
rock
which
caught
my
foot
and
threw
me
forward
upon
my
face
as
i
fell
my
hands
touched
something
like
a
flight
of
rough
steps
which
led
up
from
the
sanded
floor
of
the
cavern
without
waiting
to
call
out
to
dominie
mure
i
mounted
with
my
heart
beating
fast
with
anticipation
and
at
the
top
i
came
into
a
narrower
passage
than
any
we
had
yet
entered
which
led
me
forward
a
long
way
as
i
went
the
air
felt
unaccountably
lighter
it
smelled
most
like
a
room
dry
and
pleasant
so
that
i
waited
only
to
ascertain
that
the
passage
ended
in
another
apartment
before
going
back
to
communicate
my
fortunate
discovery
to
marjorie
and
nell
when
i
reached
the
boat
i
found
that
by
the
skilful
management
of
her
sister
marjorie
had
been
made
somewhat
more
comfortable
and
that
the
dominie
on
his
part
had
discovered
nothing
of
importance
of
which
i
was
glad
for
it
became
me
to
be
the
leader
of
our
expedition
so
i
bade
him
take
his
weapons
and
with
what
provender
we
could
carry
upon
our
backs
we
proceeded
all
of
us
together
to
the
rocky
stairway
leading
to
the
drier
inner
cave
the
dominie
had
as
usual
brought
his
pipes
over
his
shoulder
from
which
indeed
he
refused
to
be
parted
even
for
a
moment
and
but
for
the
fear
of
the
noise
reaching
our
enemies
i
think
that
there
and
then
he
would
have
played
us
both
reels
and
is
if
we
had
given
him
any
encouragement
so
pleased
was
he
and
indeed
all
of
us
to
leave
the
dark
cavern
and
oozy
sand
upon
which
we
had
first
landed
we
were
not
long
in
ascending
the
stairs
and
as
i
had
foretold
we
found
ourselves
speedily
in
the
warmer
and
drier
air
like
that
of
a
habited
house
which
was
so
great
a
change
from
the
dripping
damp
of
the
lower
that
we
rejoiced
greatly
though
quite
unable
to
discover
the
cause
yet
there
was
knew
not
the
inner
cavern
which
took
us
all
by
the
throat
indeed
we
had
not
gone
far
when
marjorie
kennedy
gasped
for
breath
and
said
let
us
go
back
i
do
not
like
the
place
but
this
i
took
to
be
no
more
than
the
dashing
of
her
spirit
by
the
adventures
of
the
night
and
the
terrors
through
which
as
she
had
already
told
us
she
had
come
in
the
dreary
and
dangerous
house
of
auchendrayne
for
the
passage
broadened
out
into
a
wider
hall
with
a
firm
floor
of
hard
earth
as
if
it
had
been
beaten
or
trampled
we
had
hardly
been
in
this
place
longer
than
a
few
moments
when
a
strangely
persistent
and
pervading
smell
began
to
impress
us
with
the
deadliest
loathing
it
was
sharp
pungent
and
familiar
yet
could
none
of
us
tell
whence
it
came
nor
in
what
place
we
had
smelled
it
before
i
am
faint
unto
death
said
marjorie
leaning
heavily
on
me
let
me
go
back
launcelot
while
i
but
this
for
the
sake
of
the
dryness
and
comfort
i
was
not
willing
to
do
so
stumbling
now
over
one
thing
and
now
over
another
in
the
darkness
i
made
shift
to
find
a
further
passage
i
chanced
to
put
down
my
hand
when
my
foot
struck
something
heavier
and
more
massive
than
before
and
lo
to
my
horror
i
touched
the
side
of
a
wooden
tub
or
vat
and
scarce
had
i
moved
from
the
place
where
i
was
before
something
cold
and
soft
brushed
my
face
as
if
it
had
been
suspended
from
the
roof
my
heart
trembled
for
we
were
plainly
in
a
place
of
habitation
of
some
unknown
and
terrible
sort
stand
still
where
you
are
i
cried
to
my
companions
for
i
was
afraid
that
they
also
might
come
against
one
of
these
obstructions
which
were
good
evidence
of
others
having
been
in
this
abode
of
horror
and
darkness
as
well
as
ourselves
immediately
i
set
to
the
groping
again
and
went
stumbling
from
one
thing
to
another
till
i
came
to
a
branching
passage
which
ascended
away
from
the
hall
and
since
here
in
the
roomy
alcove
high
above
the
floor
of
the
cave
there
were
so
far
as
i
could
find
none
of
the
vats
or
other
furniture
which
i
had
encountered
about
the
sides
of
the
greater
cave
i
decided
to
use
it
as
a
place
of
temporary
shelter
so
i
made
my
way
back
to
where
they
were
all
standing
close
together
and
i
pinched
the
dominie
s
arm
in
token
that
he
was
to
ask
no
questions
then
very
slowly
and
stealthily
we
felt
our
way
to
the
little
alcove
which
i
had
found
and
as
often
as
i
stumbled
against
anything
i
pretended
to
clatter
some
of
the
stuff
which
i
carried
upon
my
back
having
laden
myself
with
it
at
the
boat
and
so
passed
the
matter
off
at
last
we
came
to
the
which
had
been
my
latest
discovery
and
found
that
the
rock
was
cut
as
it
had
been
into
seats
all
round
about
while
the
path
ascended
upwards
at
the
back
yet
higher
into
the
stone
by
which
i
judged
that
we
had
not
yet
come
to
the
end
of
the
cavern
here
in
the
high
alcove
or
gallery
above
the
main
cave
we
accommodated
ourselves
and
disposed
our
belongings
as
well
as
we
could
for
the
darkness
the
dominie
set
himself
to
arrange
them
while
nell
and
marjorie
lay
covered
up
together
in
our
plaids
upon
the
stone
bench
which
ran
about
the
place
and
which
appeared
to
have
been
hewn
out
at
some
past
time
by
the
rude
art
of
man
but
i
myself
to
whom
it
came
as
natural
to
be
stirring
as
to
breathe
set
about
making
a
further
exploration
now
my
disappointment
was
great
when
i
found
that
we
had
indeed
come
to
the
limit
of
the
cavern
search
which
way
i
would
my
hands
encountered
nothing
but
rock
nevertheless
i
continued
my
circuit
standing
upon
the
stone
ledge
and
groping
above
me
for
it
was
possible
that
there
was
some
fresh
passage
which
from
this
alcove
might
lead
to
the
outer
air
suddenly
while
i
was
searching
with
my
hands
at
the
top
of
the
steps
of
stone
and
without
the
least
warning
my
finger
tips
fell
upon
something
which
felt
colder
than
the
stone
i
touched
the
projection
of
a
keyhole
then
the
iron
corners
of
a
chest
i
ran
my
hand
along
the
pattern
of
the
metal
bands
which
bound
the
lid
what
wonder
that
my
heart
beat
vehemently
for
i
knew
in
that
moment
that
i
had
my
hand
upon
the
treasure
of
kelwood
cave
of
for
a
moment
there
in
the
darkness
i
stood
dazed
and
my
head
swam
for
i
bethought
me
of
the
earl
s
words
as
well
as
of
the
words
of
the
minister
of
edinburgh
and
i
knew
that
my
fate
stood
upon
for
here
in
the
finding
of
this
box
lay
all
my
life
and
it
might
be
my
love
also
but
again
another
thought
crossed
the
first
damming
back
and
freezing
the
current
of
hot
blood
which
surged
to
my
heart
the
caird
s
words
in
the
grieve
s
kitchen
also
came
back
to
me
you
will
find
the
treasure
of
kelwood
in
the
cave
of
sawny
bean
in
the
head
of
bennanbrack
over
against
if
this
were
so
there
was
little
doubt
but
that
we
stood
in
the
most
instant
and
imminent
danger
of
our
lives
yet
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
leave
the
treasure
doubtless
i
ought
to
have
done
so
and
hastened
our
escape
for
the
sake
of
the
girls
nell
and
marjorie
but
i
thought
it
might
be
possible
to
convey
the
chest
out
and
so
bring
both
our
quests
to
an
end
at
for
treasure
by
the
recovery
of
the
box
which
had
been
lost
and
found
and
then
lost
again
upon
the
red
moss
and
that
of
vengeance
by
the
certain
condemnation
of
the
auchendraynes
upon
marjorie
s
evidence
the
next
moment
mighty
fear
took
hold
on
me
all
that
i
had
heard
since
my
childhood
about
the
unknown
being
who
dwelled
upon
the
of
benane
and
lived
no
man
knew
how
ran
through
my
monstrous
form
his
cloven
feet
that
made
steads
on
the
ground
like
those
of
a
beast
his
huge
hairy
arms
clawed
at
the
finger
ends
like
the
toes
of
a
bear
i
minded
me
of
the
fireside
tales
of
travellers
who
had
lost
their
way
in
that
fastness
and
who
falling
into
the
power
of
his
savage
tribe
returned
no
more
to
kindlier
places
i
minded
also
how
none
might
speak
to
the
prowler
by
night
nor
get
answer
from
every
expedition
against
him
had
come
to
naught
because
that
he
was
protected
by
a
power
stronger
than
himself
warned
and
advised
by
an
intelligence
higher
than
his
own
besides
none
had
been
able
to
find
the
abode
nor
yet
to
enter
into
the
secret
defences
where
lurked
the
of
benerard
and
it
was
in
this
abode
of
death
that
i
launce
kennedy
being
as
i
supposed
in
my
sane
mind
had
taken
refuge
with
two
women
one
the
dearest
to
me
on
earth
the
blood
ran
pingling
and
pricking
in
my
veins
at
the
thought
my
heart
cords
tightened
as
though
it
too
had
been
shut
in
a
box
and
the
key
turned
hastily
i
slipped
down
and
upon
a
pretext
took
the
dominie
aside
to
tell
him
what
it
was
that
i
had
found
ye
have
found
our
dead
warrant
then
i
wish
we
had
never
seen
your
treasures
and
boxes
said
he
roughly
as
if
i
had
done
it
with
intent
and
in
troth
i
began
to
think
he
was
right
but
it
was
none
of
my
fault
and
so
far
as
i
could
see
we
had
been
just
as
badly
off
in
that
place
if
i
had
not
found
it
at
all
after
that
i
went
ranging
hither
and
thither
among
all
the
passages
and
twinings
of
the
cave
yet
never
daring
to
go
very
far
from
the
place
where
we
were
lest
i
should
not
be
able
to
find
my
way
back
for
it
was
an
ill
murderous
uncanny
abode
where
every
step
that
i
took
something
strange
swept
across
my
face
or
slithered
clammily
along
my
cheek
making
me
grue
to
my
very
bone
marrows
i
am
as
fond
of
a
nimble
fetch
of
adventures
as
any
man
as
every
believing
reader
of
this
chronicle
kens
well
by
this
time
but
i
want
no
more
such
darkling
now
that
i
am
become
a
peaceable
man
and
no
longer
so
regardlessly
forward
as
i
once
was
in
thrusting
myself
into
all
stirs
and
quarrels
up
to
the
elbows
then
in
a
little
i
went
to
where
marjorie
and
nell
had
bestowed
themselves
when
i
told
them
how
we
had
run
into
danger
with
a
folly
and
senselessness
that
nothing
could
have
the
great
necessity
into
which
by
the
hellish
fury
of
our
enemies
we
had
been
was
indeed
cheerful
to
hear
their
words
of
trust
and
their
declarations
that
they
could
abide
the
issue
with
fortitude
so
a
little
heartened
we
made
such
preparations
as
we
preparing
our
pistols
and
loosening
our
swords
yet
all
had
to
be
done
by
touch
in
that
abode
of
darkness
and
black
deeds
it
was
silent
and
eerie
beyond
telling
in
the
cave
we
heard
the
water
lapping
further
and
further
from
us
as
it
retreated
down
the
long
passage
now
and
then
we
seemed
to
catch
a
gliff
of
the
noise
of
human
voices
but
again
when
we
listened
it
seemed
naught
but
the
wind
blowing
every
way
through
the
passages
and
halls
of
the
cave
or
the
echoed
of
the
uncanny
things
that
battened
in
the
roofs
and
crevices
of
this
murtherous
cavern
unfathomed
unsounded
and
obscure
but
we
had
not
long
to
wait
ere
our
courage
and
resolution
were
tested
to
the
uttermost
for
presently
there
came
to
us
clearly
enough
though
faintly
at
first
the
crying
and
baying
of
voices
fearful
and
threatening
indeed
they
sounded
more
like
the
insensate
howling
of
dogs
or
hungry
hounds
in
a
kennel
than
kindly
human
creatures
then
there
was
empty
silence
through
which
the
noise
came
in
gusts
like
the
sudden
deadly
anger
of
a
mob
again
it
came
more
sharp
and
with
fear
like
the
wailing
of
women
led
to
unpitied
doom
and
the
sound
of
this
inhuman
carnival
approaching
filled
the
cave
with
shuddering
this
direful
crying
came
nearer
and
nearer
till
we
all
cowered
paleface
together
save
marjorie
having
been
as
it
were
in
hell
itself
feared
not
the
most
merciless
fiends
that
might
have
broken
loose
therefrom
she
stood
a
little
apart
from
us
so
far
that
i
had
not
known
her
presence
but
for
the
draught
of
air
that
blew
inward
which
carried
her
light
robe
towards
me
so
that
its
texture
touched
my
face
and
i
was
aware
of
the
old
subtle
fragrance
which
in
happy
days
had
turned
my
head
in
the
gardens
of
culzean
but
nell
kennedy
stood
close
to
me
so
close
that
i
could
hear
her
heart
beating
and
the
little
nervous
sound
of
the
clasping
and
the
unclasping
of
her
thing
made
me
somewhat
braver
especially
when
she
put
both
her
palms
about
my
arm
and
gripped
it
convulsively
to
her
as
the
noises
of
the
crying
and
howling
waxed
louder
and
nearer
i
am
vexed
that
i
flouted
you
launce
she
whispered
in
my
ear
i
do
not
care
a
docken
what
you
said
to
kate
allison
after
all
she
is
not
such
a
girl
nor
yet
i
whispered
to
her
that
i
cared
not
either
but
that
i
was
content
to
die
for
her
oh
but
you
might
have
lived
for
me
she
moaned
if
i
had
not
led
you
into
all
this
nay
nell
my
dear
said
i
hastily
speak
not
so
you
have
ever
been
our
saviour
and
our
best
fortune
hitherto
and
so
shall
be
then
mock
us
not
in
the
darkness
of
the
cave
we
kissed
each
other
once
or
twice
amorously
and
willingly
and
the
savour
of
it
was
passing
sweet
even
when
we
looked
for
naught
but
death
give
me
a
dagger
nell
said
to
me
and
i
gave
mine
own
to
her
which
she
put
away
in
her
bosom
as
i
judged
and
again
took
my
hand
then
the
horrid
brabblement
filled
all
the
cave
and
sounded
louder
and
more
outrageous
being
heard
in
darkness
suddenly
however
the
murky
gloom
was
shot
through
with
beams
of
light
and
a
rout
of
savages
wild
and
bloody
filled
the
wide
cave
beneath
us
some
of
them
carried
rude
torches
and
others
had
various
sorts
of
which
they
cast
down
in
the
corners
i
gat
a
gliff
of
one
of
these
and
though
in
battle
i
had
often
seen
things
grim
and
butcherly
my
heart
now
sprang
to
my
mouth
so
that
i
had
fainted
with
loathing
but
i
commanded
myself
and
thrust
me
before
nell
who
from
where
she
sat
could
only
see
the
flickering
skarrow
of
the
torches
upon
the
roof
and
the
place
seemed
now
after
the
former
darkness
of
egypt
fairly
bursting
with
light
then
i
knew
that
these
execrable
must
be
the
hideous
crew
who
called
sawny
bean
lord
and
master
they
were
of
both
sexes
and
all
ages
mostly
running
naked
the
more
stalwart
of
them
armed
with
knives
and
whingers
or
with
knotted
pieces
of
tree
in
which
a
ragged
stone
had
been
thrust
and
tied
with
sinew
or
tags
of
rope
the
very
tottering
children
were
striking
at
one
another
or
biting
like
young
wolves
till
the
blood
flowed
in
the
corner
sat
an
old
bleared
hag
who
seemed
of
some
authority
over
them
for
she
pointed
with
her
finger
and
the
uproar
calmed
itself
a
little
the
shameless
naked
began
to
bestir
themselves
and
heaped
broken
driftwood
upon
the
floor
to
which
presently
a
light
was
set
then
the
red
climbing
flame
went
upward
the
wood
smoke
filled
the
cave
acrid
and
tickling
which
getting
into
our
throats
might
have
worked
us
infinite
danger
had
it
not
been
that
the
clamour
of
the
savages
was
so
great
that
it
never
stilled
for
a
moment
but
in
time
we
became
accustomed
to
the
reek
and
it
disturbed
us
not
more
by
luck
than
good
guiding
the
place
where
we
sat
was
as
i
have
said
favourably
situate
for
seeing
without
being
a
kind
of
natural
balcony
or
chamber
in
the
wall
like
a
swallow
s
nest
plastered
under
the
eaves
of
a
barn
we
learned
afterwards
that
it
was
a
place
forbidden
by
sawny
bean
the
head
of
the
clan
and
so
kept
sacred
for
himself
when
it
should
please
him
to
retire
thither
for
his
ease
and
pleasure
with
whomsoever
he
would
of
his
unholy
crew
and
to
this
no
doubt
we
owed
our
safety
for
the
young
impish
boys
roamed
everywhere
else
specially
swarming
and
yelling
about
our
boat
which
they
had
just
discovered
i
noted
also
that
when
any
of
these
came
in
the
way
of
the
men
he
was
knocked
down
incontinent
with
a
hand
a
knife
or
a
stick
as
was
most
convenient
sometimes
the
lad
would
lie
a
minute
or
two
where
he
had
been
struck
then
up
again
and
to
the
playing
and
disport
he
fell
as
though
nothing
had
happened
all
this
was
horrid
enough
but
that
was
not
the
worst
of
it
and
i
own
that
i
hesitate
to
write
that
which
i
saw
yet
for
the
sake
of
the
truth
tell
i
must
and
will
the
cavern
was
very
high
in
the
midst
but
at
the
sides
not
so
like
the
sloping
roof
of
an
attic
which
slants
quickly
down
from
the
rooftree
but
that
which
took
my
eye
amid
the
smoke
were
certain
vague
shapes
as
it
had
been
of
the
limbs
of
human
beings
shrunk
and
blackened
which
hung
in
rows
on
either
side
of
the
cave
at
first
it
seemed
that
my
eyes
must
certainly
deceive
me
for
the
reek
drifted
hither
and
thither
and
made
the
rheum
flow
from
them
with
its
bitterness
but
after
a
little
study
of
these
wall
adornments
i
could
make
nothing
else
of
it
than
that
these
poor
relics
which
hung
in
rows
from
the
roof
of
the
cave
like
hams
and
black
puddings
set
to
dry
in
the
smoke
were
indeed
no
other
than
the
parched
arms
and
legs
of
men
and
women
who
had
once
walked
the
upper
who
by
misfortune
had
fallen
into
the
power
of
this
hideous
inconceivable
gang
of
monstrous
then
the
true
interpretation
of
all
the
tales
that
went
floating
about
the
countryside
and
which
i
had
hitherto
deemed
wholly
vain
and
fantastical
burst
upon
me
but
there
was
that
nearer
to
me
which
smote
me
down
like
a
blow
taking
a
man
at
unawares
as
i
stood
up
to
look
gripping
nervously
at
my
sword
and
peering
over
there
came
a
gust
off
the
sea
roaring
up
the
passages
of
the
cavern
for
with
the
moon
the
wind
had
risen
without
the
fire
on
the
floor
flickered
upward
and
filled
the
place
with
light
i
felt
something
touch
my
cheek
speedily
i
turned
and
lo
it
was
a
little
babe
s
hand
that
swung
by
a
cord
the
wind
had
caught
it
so
light
it
was
and
it
had
rubbed
my
cheek
by
the
lord
it
was
enough
and
more
than
enough
i
sank
down
and
the
spirit
within
me
became
water
because
of
that
soft
sliding
little
hand
had
the
naked
devils
come
on
to
me
then
i
declare
i
had
not
found
power
to
lift
my
hand
against
them
nor
so
much
as
to
set
a
finger
to
the
latch
of
a
pistol
but
in
a
little
while
i
was
strengthened
for
now
as
though
i
had
never
seen
her
before
i
saw
the
true
face
of
the
brave
lass
nell
kennedy
and
it
is
passing
sweet
even
in
the
presence
of
death
to
see
the
eyes
of
the
beloved
for
the
first
time
after
declared
and
unashamed
love
has
come
into
them
she
never
took
her
sad
steadfast
regard
from
my
face
and
as
i
say
i
was
infinitely
strengthened
thereby
i
could
also
mark
marjorie
kennedy
and
since
she
stood
erect
i
knew
that
she
had
seen
all
the
blasting
horrors
i
had
perhaps
the
babe
s
hand
by
its
cord
yet
there
was
no
blanching
of
her
face
rather
she
stood
and
eyed
the
scene
with
a
calm
and
assured
countenance
like
to
a
martyr
ere
the
flames
are
lit
if
ever
any
soul
had
cast
out
fear
it
was
that
of
marjorie
kennedy
for
unfathomed
hate
can
do
that
as
well
as
perfect
especially
in
a
woman
but
when
my
eyes
fell
on
dominie
mure
i
got
a
yet
greater
start
the
little
thickset
man
who
had
been
my
brave
companion
through
such
a
multitude
of
dangers
seemed
to
be
transformed
a
still
and
biting
fury
sat
inexorably
on
his
lips
he
gripped
his
blade
as
if
he
would
spring
straight
over
the
wall
of
rock
upon
the
bestial
crew
so
afraid
was
i
to
look
upon
him
and
read
his
intent
in
his
burning
eyes
that
i
undid
for
a
moment
the
clasp
of
nell
s
hand
upon
my
shoulder
and
crawled
to
him
have
a
care
what
you
do
dominie
i
whispered
in
his
ear
remember
it
is
of
the
women
we
have
to
for
as
clearly
as
if
i
had
read
it
in
print
i
saw
his
desire
and
his
determination
he
thought
of
young
mary
torrance
the
lass
that
had
been
spirited
away
and
the
red
stain
on
the
grass
and
the
ghastly
garniture
about
the
walls
of
the
monster
s
cave
had
revealed
to
him
the
conclusion
of
the
untold
tale
but
my
words
stopped
him
dead
like
a
bullet
in
the
heart
of
a
springing
wild
cat
on
the
bough
he
looked
just
once
at
me
and
his
eyes
had
the
same
wild
glare
but
there
came
that
into
them
which
told
me
of
a
thought
greater
than
the
stark
revenge
on
which
he
had
been
all
intent
but
a
few
moments
before
i
bent
still
nearer
to
his
ear
dominie
i
said
if
they
come
at
us
mind
that
we
are
not
to
leave
the
lasses
alive
to
fall
into
their
bloody
he
looked
at
me
with
a
haggard
face
and
shook
his
head
i
can
not
do
it
he
said
and
set
his
hands
over
his
eyes
to
hide
the
torches
flare
when
he
looked
up
again
i
pointed
to
the
loathed
things
that
decked
the
walls
in
the
eaves
of
the
cave
and
to
the
pickle
barrels
that
stood
in
the
corners
the
dominie
understood
and
nodded
surely
you
can
if
can
i
whispered
to
him
i
will
take
care
of
love
if
and
i
looked
at
marjorie
so
that
he
understood
fully
then
came
my
eyes
back
to
nell
they
felt
hot
and
dry
for
i
was
taken
with
the
reek
in
them
and
my
heart
rose
within
me
to
think
that
in
a
swift
tale
of
moments
i
might
have
to
take
away
the
sweet
life
from
my
own
heart
s
love
but
when
i
went
back
to
her
there
was
a
new
light
of
understanding
in
the
face
on
which
the
flicker
of
the
fire
was
reflected
from
the
roof
i
knew
that
she
had
seen
and
understood
the
import
of
my
colloquy
with
the
dominie
and
our
looking
from
the
one
to
the
other
of
them
yet
the
fear
had
strangely
gone
from
her
face
i
declare
she
looked
almost
glad
she
set
her
lips
to
my
ear
launce
she
whispered
i
want
none
but
you
to
do
so
be
that
it
comes
to
that
you
will
will
you
not
launce
then
i
knew
that
she
had
understood
all
the
love
she
had
seen
in
my
face
for
indeed
i
would
rather
had
killed
my
sweetheart
a
hundred
times
than
let
her
fall
alive
into
the
hands
of
such
a
ghastly
bestial
devil
s
crew
so
nell
kennedy
trusting
me
with
the
manner
of
her
death
as
though
it
had
been
a
little
between
ourselves
sat
looking
up
at
me
with
such
eyes
of
love
and
trust
that
they
went
nigh
to
make
me
forget
that
cimmerian
den
and
the
ghoulish
beasts
that
rioted
in
it
of
thus
we
sat
a
long
time
waiting
suddenly
there
was
a
pause
in
the
noise
which
filled
the
cavern
below
i
thought
for
a
moment
that
they
had
discovered
us
but
marjorie
moved
her
hand
a
little
to
bid
me
keep
down
and
very
carefully
i
raised
my
head
over
the
rock
so
that
through
the
niche
i
could
as
before
look
down
upon
them
the
of
the
cave
was
now
entirely
filled
by
a
black
bulk
in
shape
like
a
grizzly
ape
even
in
the
flickering
light
i
knew
instantly
that
i
had
seen
the
monster
before
a
thrill
ran
through
me
when
i
remembered
the
the
thing
with
which
i
had
grappled
in
the
barn
of
culzean
the
night
i
the
grey
man
and
now
by
the
silence
and
the
crouching
of
the
horde
beneath
me
i
learned
that
their
master
had
come
home
the
monster
stood
a
moment
in
the
doorway
as
though
angered
at
something
then
he
spoke
in
a
voice
like
a
beast
s
growl
certain
things
which
i
could
not
at
all
it
was
clear
that
his
progeny
did
for
there
ensued
a
tumultuous
rushing
from
side
to
side
then
sawny
bean
strode
into
the
midst
of
his
den
it
happened
that
by
misadventure
he
stumbled
and
set
his
foot
upon
a
lad
of
six
or
seven
judging
by
the
size
of
him
who
sprawled
naked
in
the
doorway
the
imp
squirmed
round
like
a
serpent
and
bit
sawny
bean
in
the
leg
whereat
he
stooped
and
catching
the
lad
by
the
feet
he
dashed
his
head
with
a
dull
crash
against
the
wall
and
threw
him
quivering
like
a
dead
rabbit
into
the
corner
the
rest
stood
for
a
moment
aghast
but
in
a
trice
and
without
a
single
one
so
much
as
going
to
see
if
the
boy
were
dead
or
only
stunned
the
whole
hornet
s
byke
hummed
again
and
the
place
was
filled
with
a
stifling
smell
of
burning
fat
and
roasting
victual
upon
the
origin
of
which
i
dared
not
let
my
mind
for
a
moment
dwell
when
sawny
bean
came
in
he
had
that
which
looked
like
a
rich
cloth
of
gold
over
his
plunder
of
some
poor
butchered
wretch
belike
he
stood
with
this
trophy
in
front
of
him
examining
it
before
the
fire
presently
he
threw
it
over
his
shoulders
with
the
arms
hanging
idly
down
in
front
and
strode
about
most
like
a
or
a
mad
manifestly
to
his
own
great
content
and
to
the
huge
admiration
of
his
followers
who
stood
still
and
gaped
after
him
when
he
had
satisfied
himself
with
this
posturing
the
monster
looked
towards
our
place
of
refuge
a
great
spasm
seized
my
heart
when
i
saw
him
take
the
first
step
towards
us
for
i
guessed
that
it
was
his
forbidden
in
which
we
lurked
so
i
thought
it
had
certainly
come
to
the
last
bitter
push
with
us
but
something
yet
more
terrible
than
the
matter
of
the
boy
diverted
for
the
moment
the
monster
s
attention
the
lad
whom
he
had
cast
to
the
side
had
been
left
alone
none
daring
to
meddle
but
now
as
he
passed
him
sawny
bean
gave
the
body
a
toss
with
his
foot
at
this
quick
as
a
darting
falcon
on
the
stoop
a
woman
sprang
at
him
from
a
crevice
where
she
had
been
least
by
her
shape
she
was
a
woman
with
long
twisting
like
snakes
about
her
brow
and
over
her
shoulders
she
held
an
open
knife
in
her
hand
and
she
struck
at
the
chieftain
s
hairy
breast
i
heard
the
point
strike
the
flesh
and
the
cry
of
anger
and
pain
which
followed
but
the
monster
caught
the
woman
by
the
wrist
pulled
her
over
his
knee
and
bent
back
her
head
it
was
a
horrid
thing
to
see
and
there
is
small
wonder
that
i
can
see
it
yet
in
many
a
dream
of
the
night
and
no
doubt
also
i
shall
see
it
till
i
it
as
well
which
is
worse
then
for
a
long
season
i
could
look
no
more
but
when
i
had
recovered
me
a
little
and
could
again
command
my
heart
i
saw
a
great
part
of
the
crew
swarm
thick
as
carrying
and
working
like
bees
upon
spilled
honey
about
the
corner
where
had
lain
the
bodies
of
the
lad
and
the
woman
but
it
was
not
in
the
ordinary
way
that
these
were
being
prepared
for
burial
in
the
centre
of
the
cave
sat
sawny
bean
with
some
of
the
younger
sort
of
the
women
pawing
over
him
and
bandaging
his
wounded
shoulder
he
was
growling
and
spitting
inarticulately
all
the
while
like
a
wild
cat
and
every
time
his
shoulder
hurt
him
as
the
women
worked
with
the
wound
and
mouthed
it
he
would
take
his
other
hand
and
strike
one
of
them
down
as
though
it
was
to
her
that
he
owed
the
twinge
of
pain
presently
the
monster
arose
and
took
the
gold
brocade
again
in
his
hand
i
thought
that
of
a
certainty
now
our
time
was
come
and
i
looked
at
nell
kennedy
god
knows
what
was
in
my
eyes
my
heart
within
me
was
ready
to
break
for
the
like
of
this
pass
had
never
man
been
in
that
i
should
have
to
smite
my
love
to
the
death
within
an
hour
of
my
first
kiss
and
the
first
owning
of
her
affection
but
she
that
loved
me
read
my
thought
in
mine
eyes
she
bared
her
neck
for
me
so
that
i
could
see
its
tender
whiteness
in
the
flicker
of
the
fire
strike
there
she
said
and
let
me
die
in
your
arms
who
art
my
own
heart
s
love
launcelot
i
heard
the
s
step
on
the
stair
i
looked
from
nell
s
dear
neck
to
her
eyes
and
back
again
to
her
bosom
then
i
lifted
my
hand
with
the
steel
in
it
and
nerved
myself
for
the
striking
for
i
must
make
no
mistake
and
even
in
that
moment
i
saw
the
gleam
of
a
dagger
in
marjorie
s
hand
also
suddenly
a
tremendous
rush
of
sound
filled
the
cave
the
blade
fell
from
my
hand
and
by
instinct
not
knowing
what
we
did
nell
and
i
clasped
one
another
the
clamour
seemed
to
be
about
us
and
all
round
us
roaring
echoes
came
back
to
us
the
bowels
of
the
earth
quaked
yet
methought
there
was
something
strongly
familiar
in
the
sound
of
it
i
turned
me
about
and
there
standing
erect
with
all
his
little
height
was
the
dominie
his
cheeks
were
distended
and
he
was
blowing
upon
his
great
such
a
thunderous
pibroch
as
never
had
been
heard
east
of
the
minch
since
the
island
pipes
skirled
on
the
red
harlaw
what
madcap
possession
had
come
upon
his
mind
i
know
not
but
the
effect
i
can
tell
the
pack
of
fiends
that
caroused
and
slew
beneath
stood
stricken
a
moment
in
amaze
at
the
dreadful
incomprehensible
sounds
then
they
fled
yellyhooing
with
fear
down
the
narrow
from
which
the
tide
had
now
fully
ebbed
and
when
i
looked
again
there
was
not
a
soul
to
be
seen
only
over
the
edge
of
a
lappered
cauldron
the
body
of
the
murdered
woman
or
at
least
a
part
of
it
lay
bloody
incentive
to
make
haste
out
of
this
direful
cave
of
death
the
dominie
stepped
down
from
our
hidden
alcove
as
though
he
had
been
leading
a
march
strutting
and
passaging
like
the
king
s
piper
marching
about
the
banqueting
table
at
holyrood
i
declare
the
creature
seemed
he
was
certainly
possessed
with
a
devil
but
the
very
fearlessness
of
the
deed
won
into
our
veins
also
for
with
steel
or
pistol
in
each
of
our
hands
we
marched
after
and
indeed
eager
to
encounter
aught
that
might
come
in
our
way
ay
and
even
thus
we
passed
out
of
the
cave
hasting
down
the
long
passage
without
a
quiver
of
the
heart
or
a
blenching
of
the
suddenly
and
so
starkly
by
way
of
unexpected
hope
had
the
glorious
music
brought
the
hot
blood
back
to
our
hearts
even
as
it
had
stricken
our
cruel
foes
with
instant
terror
thus
dryshod
we
marched
out
of
the
cave
of
sawny
bean
and
as
i
am
a
true
man
not
so
much
as
a
dog
barked
at
us
but
when
we
emerged
into
the
grey
of
a
stormy
morning
and
reached
the
cliff
s
edge
we
heard
inland
the
wild
voices
of
the
gang
yelling
down
the
wind
as
though
the
furies
of
fear
were
still
pursuing
them
and
tearing
at
their
vitals
what
they
expected
i
know
not
but
i
conceive
that
they
must
have
taken
the
dominie
s
pipes
for
whatever
particular
devil
they
happened
to
believe
in
come
to
take
them
quick
to
their
own
place
which
after
all
could
not
be
much
worse
than
the
den
in
which
we
had
seen
them
at
their
disport
nor
could
all
the
torturing
fiends
of
lowest
hell
have
been
their
marrows
in
devilish
cruelty
lochaber
aix
gied
him
his
so
once
more
the
world
was
before
us
and
strangely
peaceful
it
seemed
as
if
somehow
or
other
we
had
died
in
stress
and
riot
and
been
born
again
into
an
uncanny
quiet
there
remained
for
us
now
only
the
bringing
to
pass
of
righteous
judgments
upon
the
wicked
ones
who
had
compassed
and
plotted
all
this
terrible
tale
of
murders
without
end
these
hellish
cruelties
and
deceits
for
the
vengeance
must
not
fall
alone
on
the
crazed
outlaw
and
his
brood
since
the
chief
criminals
were
those
that
were
greater
and
wiser
than
sawny
bean
and
his
merciless
crew
it
was
as
i
say
the
breaking
of
a
stormy
morrow
when
we
faced
up
the
brae
sword
in
hand
finding
none
to
withstand
us
for
all
had
fled
before
the
music
of
the
wild
highland
drones
then
in
the
sustaining
quiet
i
asked
the
dominie
by
what
inspiration
he
had
thought
of
such
a
mad
thing
as
thus
blasting
upon
the
oh
it
just
came
to
me
said
he
lightly
and
with
that
he
wiped
his
chanter
and
set
the
drones
under
his
arm
letting
them
hang
down
as
though
they
had
been
the
legs
of
a
lamb
which
a
herd
has
found
on
the
hill
but
our
troubles
were
not
yet
over
for
we
had
to
pass
through
many
miles
of
bargany
country
ere
we
could
reach
our
own
folk
i
proposed
to
turn
landwards
for
that
as
the
crow
flies
is
the
shortest
road
but
the
dominie
denied
me
saying
that
since
those
cruel
monsters
of
the
band
had
fled
that
way
the
closer
we
kept
to
the
coast
the
safer
we
should
be
we
made
therefore
only
such
a
detour
as
would
enable
us
to
escape
the
town
of
girvan
which
was
a
strength
of
our
foes
and
passing
by
killochan
a
pleasant
and
friendly
tower
well
set
in
a
wooded
valley
with
a
view
of
our
old
strength
of
ailsa
we
hastened
as
fast
as
we
could
march
with
the
women
in
our
company
to
culzean
now
near
by
killochan
there
was
a
school
and
a
schoolmaster
the
name
of
him
john
guid
he
had
been
for
a
long
season
a
friend
and
crony
of
our
dominie
mure
to
him
we
resorted
or
rather
the
dominie
went
alone
to
seek
him
while
i
abode
with
marjorie
and
nell
it
was
over
in
the
afternoon
when
he
came
back
and
what
was
our
joy
to
hear
behind
him
the
trampling
of
a
pair
of
hardy
ponies
for
with
the
weariness
of
her
terrible
quest
and
the
stress
of
the
night
in
the
cave
of
death
marjorie
looked
dismally
near
to
her
end
and
indeed
i
am
not
sure
that
nell
was
greatly
better
marjorie
had
passed
some
part
of
the
long
march
in
telling
us
in
bits
and
snatches
the
tale
of
her
sufferings
her
flight
and
capture
and
how
by
evil
and
hateful
hands
she
had
been
flung
into
the
water
from
off
the
heuch
of
benerard
it
was
a
tale
of
most
tyrannous
wrong
and
shall
be
kept
for
its
own
place
when
marjorie
came
to
tell
it
to
a
greater
and
more
powerful
than
either
launcelot
kennedy
or
dominie
mure
of
maybole
i
shall
therefore
let
the
reader
wait
yet
a
brief
space
for
the
explanation
of
many
things
which
are
dark
to
him
now
and
which
had
been
equally
dark
to
me
till
that
gusty
morning
so
we
four
fared
northward
over
the
moors
of
carrick
with
marjorie
and
nell
riding
upon
the
garrons
and
the
dominie
and
myself
hasting
along
by
their
side
with
a
hand
apiece
in
their
we
were
just
by
the
edge
of
the
red
moss
and
going
straight
and
snell
for
my
lord
earl
s
house
of
cassillis
when
nell
who
was
ever
our
most
watcher
cried
out
that
we
were
pursued
and
when
i
had
turned
me
about
and
looked
i
saw
that
of
a
surety
it
was
so
then
i
thought
that
if
it
should
happen
that
we
were
attacked
it
might
be
as
well
to
have
the
advantage
of
position
so
i
posted
our
party
on
a
little
heathery
mound
having
an
open
lairy
moss
in
front
with
dangerous
quags
trembling
bogs
and
square
black
islands
of
moss
and
peat
standing
in
the
midst
all
gashed
and
riven
here
we
waited
the
two
men
of
us
under
arms
in
front
and
the
maids
standing
close
behind
the
horses
with
the
bridles
loose
in
their
hands
i
had
cast
my
cloak
over
the
shoulder
of
nell
s
sheltie
to
clear
my
arms
for
the
fray
if
indeed
it
should
come
to
the
clash
of
blows
and
it
pleased
me
well
to
see
her
catch
it
without
a
word
and
fold
it
like
a
wife
who
watches
her
husband
and
is
pleased
to
anticipate
his
need
this
indeed
i
say
it
twice
pleased
me
well
for
i
knew
that
she
had
done
with
daffing
with
me
any
more
and
that
she
had
at
last
forgotten
all
the
matters
concerning
that
pretty
kate
allison
the
three
men
who
rode
toward
us
were
at
first
to
our
sight
like
ships
low
down
on
the
but
they
mounted
steadily
spears
and
pennons
first
after
that
the
shine
of
armour
and
then
the
heads
of
their
horses
becking
and
bowing
with
the
travail
of
the
moss
then
verily
we
that
stood
had
anxious
hearts
for
we
knew
not
whether
they
might
chance
to
be
friend
or
foe
and
indeed
it
was
well
that
we
looked
for
the
worst
as
they
came
nearer
we
saw
that
the
two
who
rode
ahead
were
armed
in
a
knightly
way
and
gripped
lances
in
their
hands
but
the
third
who
came
behind
and
held
a
little
aloof
was
plainly
clad
in
a
grey
cloak
and
hat
it
is
auchendrayne
and
a
younger
man
with
the
wolf
of
drummurchie
in
their
company
it
could
not
well
be
worse
said
the
dominie
we
are
like
to
be
hard
and
i
knew
that
marjorie
kennedy
looked
once
more
upon
the
man
who
in
cold
blood
had
slain
her
father
and
also
upon
the
man
who
according
to
the
law
was
her
husband
i
had
looked
for
them
to
call
a
parley
and
had
set
myself
in
front
to
acquit
me
well
in
the
barter
of
words
before
the
damsels
but
i
was
not
prepared
for
the
event
as
it
happened
for
without
a
word
of
preamble
warning
or
john
mure
of
auchendrayne
he
in
the
cloak
of
grey
cried
out
have
at
them
slay
them
every
one
tis
now
too
late
for
whimsies
it
is
our
lives
for
theirs
if
we
do
so
with
that
the
two
younger
came
on
couching
their
long
lances
and
riding
directly
at
us
i
stuck
my
sword
downward
by
the
point
naked
in
the
soft
moss
at
my
side
so
that
i
should
not
have
it
to
draw
out
of
the
sheath
when
it
came
to
the
pinch
and
for
the
last
time
i
looked
at
my
pistol
priming
and
longed
horribly
for
one
of
my
lord
s
new
hackbutts
of
the
french
pattern
out
of
the
armoury
of
cassillis
but
wishing
would
not
bring
them
or
i
had
had
a
dozen
each
with
a
good
culzean
man
behind
it
with
his
finger
on
the
touch
but
yet
you
may
depend
that
my
imagination
bodied
them
forth
standing
there
useless
in
the
press
oiled
and
burnished
as
i
had
seen
them
and
all
the
while
the
two
villains
came
on
now
in
a
plain
place
we
had
had
but
little
chance
to
stand
against
them
cumbered
with
the
women
as
we
were
but
the
peat
hag
i
had
chosen
for
our
defence
on
the
edge
of
the
red
moss
favoured
us
when
however
i
had
fired
my
pistol
and
made
nothing
of
it
save
only
the
clink
of
the
bullet
whizzing
off
the
plate
metal
they
got
time
to
ride
round
the
main
obstruction
then
it
had
gone
hard
with
us
indeed
but
that
the
dominie
mure
as
the
horses
came
forward
blew
so
sudden
a
snorting
blast
upon
his
pipes
that
one
of
the
steeds
swerved
and
stumbled
almost
throwing
his
rider
to
the
ground
then
ere
he
had
time
to
recover
the
dominie
was
upon
him
with
his
sword
springing
upward
and
striking
like
an
angry
ever
at
the
face
so
that
it
took
the
horseman
all
his
time
to
defend
himself
the
other
drave
at
me
full
tilt
with
his
long
spear
and
though
i
leapt
aside
from
the
i
with
only
my
pistol
and
sword
had
been
no
better
than
a
dead
man
at
the
next
turn
but
marjorie
kennedy
giving
the
bridle
reins
of
both
horses
to
her
sister
seized
the
dominie
s
lochaber
axe
she
sprang
behind
the
visored
man
and
hooking
the
bent
prong
in
his
gorget
collar
behind
she
pulled
him
down
from
his
horse
with
a
clash
of
armour
then
after
that
there
remained
nothing
for
me
to
do
but
to
set
my
sword
to
his
throat
and
bid
him
yield
himself
by
this
time
the
frightened
horse
which
had
stumbled
first
became
perfectly
mad
and
turning
in
spite
of
all
that
thomas
of
drummurchie
could
do
it
galloped
away
with
him
across
the
red
moss
then
the
man
in
the
grey
cloak
also
put
his
horse
to
its
speed
so
soon
as
he
saw
how
the
matter
was
like
to
go
for
he
had
kept
at
a
distance
and
taken
no
part
in
the
fighting
we
were
therefore
left
alone
victorious
without
a
wound
and
with
the
man
in
the
visor
our
prisoner
he
seemed
to
be
stunned
with
his
fall
so
marjorie
stooped
and
undid
his
laced
shelling
his
head
as
one
shells
the
husk
of
a
nut
from
the
kernel
the
man
whom
she
revealed
was
james
mure
the
younger
of
auchendrayne
her
wedded
husband
we
stood
thus
some
time
in
wonderment
what
should
be
the
upshot
marjorie
kennedy
i
can
not
while
i
live
call
her
by
any
other
name
stood
looking
down
at
the
man
to
whom
in
foulest
treachery
she
had
been
given
then
after
a
while
nell
touched
my
arm
and
lo
on
the
moss
there
was
yet
another
man
on
horseback
coming
towards
us
i
knew
the
beast
it
was
the
same
on
which
the
wolf
of
drummurchie
had
ridden
but
the
man
was
other
than
the
wolf
the
thing
was
a
mystery
to
us
but
at
last
nell
whose
eyes
were
like
an
eagle
s
for
as
i
have
before
observed
of
heavenly
beauty
cried
out
it
is
robert
are
saved
which
was
no
great
things
of
a
saying
for
i
myself
had
saved
her
ten
times
during
that
last
night
and
day
if
it
came
to
any
talk
of
saving
yet
i
think
from
that
moment
she
began
to
draw
away
a
little
from
me
whether
as
remembering
some
of
my
old
ploys
with
that
tricksy
lass
who
was
now
robert
harburgh
s
wife
or
partly
lest
she
should
have
seemed
to
be
in
owning
her
love
for
me
at
any
rate
after
i
had
thought
over
her
unkindness
and
sudden
chill
a
little
while
i
was
not
sure
that
it
might
not
be
after
all
the
best
sign
in
the
world
for
as
the
reader
of
this
chronicle
must
have
gathered
i
am
a
man
of
some
penetration
in
these
matters
and
it
is
not
given
to
any
woman
to
twine
launcelot
kennedy
in
a
knot
about
her
little
finger
also
i
have
had
very
considerable
experience
faith
cried
robert
harburgh
when
he
had
ridden
up
whom
have
we
here
i
answered
him
with
another
question
where
gat
ye
that
horse
robert
i
got
it
he
replied
readily
and
also
calmly
from
a
man
that
is
little
likely
to
need
it
again
at
least
for
a
tale
of
from
thomas
of
drummurchie
i
asked
who
else
said
harburgh
simply
as
though
the
fact
had
been
sufficient
explanation
as
indeed
it
the
way
he
said
it
but
all
the
while
marjorie
stood
looking
calmly
down
at
james
mure
he
recovered
little
by
little
from
the
stunning
knock
and
presently
made
as
if
he
would
sit
up
tie
his
hands
said
marjorie
kennedy
and
then
seeing
that
we
nay
give
me
the
halter
she
said
i
will
do
it
and
there
on
the
open
moor
with
the
bridle
of
his
own
beast
i
declare
she
did
the
binding
featly
and
well
now
listen
james
mure
she
said
raising
her
voice
ye
have
steeped
your
hands
in
my
father
s
blood
ye
have
shed
yet
more
blood
to
cover
that
crime
even
the
blood
of
an
innocent
young
child
with
these
hands
that
are
tied
you
did
these
things
i
am
your
wife
i
will
never
leave
you
nor
forsake
you
till
you
die
i
will
see
that
you
have
fair
and
honourable
trial
but
be
assured
that
i
shall
testify
against
you
truly
as
to
that
which
i
know
and
have
seen
she
turned
to
us
with
her
old
easy
way
of
command
imperiously
gracious
but
sharper
a
little
than
her
ordinary
mount
him
on
that
horse
she
said
like
a
queen
who
issues
commands
to
her
court
and
this
was
she
who
had
walked
gladsomely
with
me
in
the
garden
at
culzean
and
who
in
smiling
maidenly
condescension
had
given
a
boy
her
favour
to
wear
what
agony
of
hell
had
passed
over
her
spirit
thus
to
turn
the
sweet
maiden
to
a
woman
of
stone
whither
shall
we
take
him
said
i
for
it
seemed
to
me
not
at
all
expedient
to
delay
longer
than
we
could
help
in
that
disturbed
and
fatal
part
of
the
country
to
the
earl
on
his
way
to
the
king
replied
marjorie
kennedy
if
ye
bide
still
where
ye
are
ye
will
see
the
earl
come
hither
said
robert
harburgh
he
rides
to
the
south
to
hold
his
yearly
court
of
bailiary
on
the
borders
of
for
since
the
great
defeat
of
the
bargany
faction
and
the
death
of
the
young
chief
at
the
gate
of
maybole
upon
that
memorable
day
of
snow
my
lord
cassillis
had
gained
more
and
more
in
power
so
that
none
now
was
able
to
make
any
head
openly
against
him
the
death
of
sir
thomas
my
good
master
had
also
thrown
all
that
additional
weight
of
authority
upon
his
shoulders
indeed
earl
john
bode
fair
to
be
what
his
father
had
been
before
king
of
carrick
his
titular
jurisdiction
had
always
included
the
southern
parts
of
the
district
but
it
was
only
of
late
that
he
had
made
himself
so
strong
as
to
be
able
to
enforce
his
authority
there
now
however
earl
john
was
riding
to
hold
his
court
near
girvan
in
a
country
which
not
a
great
while
ago
had
been
purely
a
stronghold
of
his
enemies
and
which
still
swarmed
with
the
disaffected
and
rebellious
so
even
while
we
stood
and
waited
there
nell
cried
out
that
a
cavalcade
rode
southward
toward
us
by
the
edge
of
the
red
moss
it
was
not
long
before
we
could
discern
the
fluttering
pennons
of
blue
and
gold
which
denoted
the
presence
of
the
earl
he
had
with
him
a
noble
retinue
of
four
handsomely
of
them
knights
and
gentlemen
of
his
own
name
we
waited
for
them
to
come
up
with
us
i
meanwhile
keeping
close
by
nell
s
side
and
marjorie
kennedy
standing
steadfastly
at
her
husband
s
head
and
looking
at
him
while
robert
harburgh
marched
up
and
down
with
his
hands
under
his
points
and
whistled
the
broom
o
the
when
the
earl
john
riding
first
as
was
his
custom
perceived
who
we
were
he
lighted
down
with
much
courtesy
to
salute
his
cousins
how
do
you
ladies
and
what
by
the
grace
of
god
brings
you
hither
with
so
small
a
company
in
such
a
dangerous
place
then
said
marjorie
earl
of
cassillis
you
are
my
cousin
but
you
are
also
bailzie
of
carrick
and
hold
the
power
of
life
and
death
i
take
you
and
all
your
company
to
witness
that
i
deliver
over
to
you
this
man
called
james
mure
of
auchendrayne
he
is
twice
a
convict
cruelly
he
slew
my
father
and
your
uncle
and
i
charge
him
also
with
the
fact
of
the
murder
of
william
dalrymple
a
poor
boy
of
tender
years
whom
he
killed
with
his
own
hands
to
cover
the
first
which
accusations
i
shall
in
due
time
make
the
earl
was
manifestly
mightily
astonished
as
well
he
might
be
at
the
lady
marjorie
s
declaration
but
he
was
glad
also
because
it
was
no
light
thing
for
him
to
lay
the
enemy
of
his
house
by
the
heels
and
seeing
good
prospect
of
getting
the
mures
attainted
and
denounced
to
be
able
to
make
himself
omnipotent
in
all
the
lands
of
the
south
bring
the
man
along
with
us
he
commanded
let
him
have
all
tendance
and
care
but
let
a
double
guard
be
placed
over
i
will
be
his
guard
said
marjorie
firmly
i
and
no
other
nevertheless
earl
john
named
a
retinue
to
ride
with
marjorie
and
her
husband
in
the
name
of
a
guard
of
honour
but
really
because
he
felt
his
fingers
already
on
the
throat
of
his
house
s
enemy
and
as
we
rode
back
the
way
we
had
no
longer
in
fear
and
trembling
but
in
manifest
state
and
sate
humbly
upon
a
sheltie
by
the
side
of
the
man
who
was
lawfully
her
husband
and
yet
whom
she
had
most
sacredly
vowed
to
bring
to
the
gallows
and
for
the
present
the
dominie
and
i
resolved
to
keep
the
secret
of
the
cave
of
death
and
of
the
fearsome
inner
place
where
was
bestowed
the
treasure
of
kelwood
but
immediately
after
the
court
of
justiceaire
i
resolved
to
make
it
known
to
the
earl
for
so
nell
and
i
had
made
our
compact
and
as
for
the
dominie
he
might
be
relied
upon
to
speak
or
to
be
silent
even
as
i
bade
him
moot
hill
of
as
may
well
be
imagined
two
hundred
gentlemen
with
their
retinue
of
as
many
more
of
the
commonalty
made
a
gallant
stir
and
required
almost
the
providing
of
an
army
so
that
as
we
went
southward
the
people
were
well
warned
to
repair
to
the
court
of
my
lord
bailzie
of
carrick
for
the
office
of
earl
john
was
the
greatest
of
the
lowland
hereditary
jurisdictions
though
the
house
of
cassillis
has
never
been
so
beloved
of
the
people
nor
yet
so
careful
of
their
rights
as
that
of
the
agnews
of
lochnaw
who
from
very
ancient
times
have
been
sheriffs
of
galloway
nevertheless
it
was
a
right
solemn
gathering
which
assembled
on
the
little
hill
outside
the
town
of
girvan
where
such
feudal
courts
had
always
been
held
within
the
enclosure
formed
by
the
fluttering
blue
and
gold
pennons
of
the
earl
there
was
set
a
high
seat
for
cassillis
himself
in
front
of
him
at
a
draped
table
sat
his
adviser
and
assessor
lawyer
boyd
of
penkill
while
all
round
the
gentlemen
of
his
house
and
name
sat
or
stood
according
to
their
degree
just
outside
the
line
of
pennons
within
which
none
might
come
save
the
accused
and
they
who
gave
their
evidence
then
the
trumpeter
from
the
summit
of
the
moot
hill
of
girvan
made
proclamation
with
three
blasts
of
his
horn
that
the
session
was
open
and
that
all
men
s
causes
were
to
be
brought
to
the
probation
first
there
came
sundry
usual
complaints
of
stouthreif
and
oppression
for
the
country
was
yet
very
unsettled
a
woman
cried
for
vengeance
on
thomas
of
drummurchie
called
the
wolf
for
the
carrying
off
of
her
daughter
but
as
drummurchie
was
already
ten
times
attainted
it
seemed
as
though
little
would
come
of
it
but
robert
harburgh
strode
forward
and
cried
out
by
your
leave
earl
of
cassillis
the
wolf
of
drummurchie
will
carry
off
no
more
tender
lambs
neither
mell
with
other
men
s
wives
any
more
the
dainty
ladies
of
ayr
need
no
more
draw
their
purses
to
rescue
him
neither
to
provide
him
with
costly
gear
for
he
has
gone
to
a
country
where
he
shall
be
keeped
bien
and
warm
beiking
forever
foment
the
hottest
fires
of
satan
so
lately
his
master
here
on
earth
and
with
that
he
threw
the
arms
and
accoutrement
of
the
wolf
on
the
green
with
prodigious
clatterment
but
this
said
the
earl
john
though
greatly
creditable
to
our
squire
and
of
excellent
omen
for
the
peace
of
carrick
from
this
day
forth
gives
not
this
poor
woman
again
her
for
he
did
not
wish
to
assign
any
reward
to
robert
harburgh
besides
the
lands
which
had
already
been
given
him
perhaps
desiring
to
retain
so
valiant
a
sworder
near
to
his
own
person
and
estate
i
had
been
to
the
house
of
drummurchie
ere
i
settled
accounts
with
the
wolf
himself
replied
robert
harburgh
in
the
same
manner
of
exceeding
quiet
and
there
have
i
set
all
things
in
order
sending
every
man
s
daughter
to
her
father
s
house
and
every
man
s
wife
back
to
his
retaining
none
for
yourself
cried
earl
john
for
daffing
s
sake
for
that
was
his
idea
of
a
jest
whatever
my
desires
i
have
married
a
wife
that
sees
to
as
hath
also
my
lord
earl
quoth
robert
harburgh
and
so
the
laugh
was
turned
against
the
earl
john
because
all
knew
how
carefully
the
ancient
countess
kept
the
valleys
about
cassillis
and
the
inch
clear
of
buxom
dames
and
maids
for
in
his
youth
earl
john
had
the
name
of
being
both
generally
and
most
subtly
amorous
yet
strange
to
say
the
jest
thus
broken
at
his
expense
put
the
earl
into
a
good
key
for
it
was
only
the
outlay
of
money
that
he
grudged
so
he
cried
out
robert
harburgh
your
tongue
can
be
as
sharp
as
your
rapier
you
have
rid
us
of
a
great
curse
here
in
the
south
and
there
is
muckle
need
in
these
parts
of
such
a
sword
and
such
a
tongue
as
yours
to
keep
the
landward
oafs
in
civility
you
shall
have
the
lands
of
drummurchie
with
ten
men
s
fighting
charges
to
hold
them
against
all
evil
folk
till
such
time
as
the
land
be
and
robert
harburgh
bowed
low
to
his
lord
and
retired
as
he
went
i
clapped
him
on
the
back
and
said
robert
i
would
that
my
long
sword
had
done
as
muckle
for
steady
on
the
hilt
keep
your
point
low
your
tongue
silent
and
it
shall
do
more
he
answered
over
his
shoulder
as
he
went
by
then
was
brought
forward
james
mure
of
auchendrayne
clad
only
in
the
suit
of
russet
leather
which
he
had
worn
under
the
mail
wherein
he
had
been
taken
he
was
ever
a
oaf
and
now
looked
sullenly
and
silently
upon
the
ground
his
names
and
titles
were
first
declared
who
accuses
this
man
and
of
what
cried
earl
john
in
loud
tones
and
every
man
in
the
assembly
moved
a
little
as
though
he
itched
to
be
the
accuser
himself
but
since
there
was
none
that
directly
knew
of
our
adventure
no
one
stood
forth
save
our
marjorie
and
nell
till
i
myself
stepped
forth
with
them
with
robert
harburgh
and
the
dominie
a
little
behind
us
now
speak
out
whispered
harburgh
of
the
long
sword
to
me
and
let
your
nimble
wit
win
you
a
and
i
looked
at
nell
and
resolved
that
if
she
slipped
through
my
fingers
it
should
not
be
the
fault
of
my
lack
of
address
who
accuses
this
man
cried
the
herald
taking
the
word
from
his
master
for
the
lords
of
carrick
and
cassillis
were
beyond
the
paltry
fashion
of
pursuivants
i
do
said
marjorie
kennedy
and
all
men
set
their
eyes
on
her
neither
so
long
as
the
case
lasted
did
they
withdraw
their
eyes
from
her
face
then
she
opened
her
mouth
and
spoke
firmly
and
sternly
her
accusation
i
marjorie
daughter
of
the
tutor
of
cassillis
in
law
wife
to
this
man
charge
james
mure
the
younger
of
auchendrayne
with
the
murder
of
my
father
committed
as
all
men
know
upon
the
sandhills
of
ayr
i
also
accuse
him
of
the
murder
of
william
dalrymple
the
lad
who
carried
the
message
to
auchendrayne
concerning
my
father
s
cousin
said
earl
john
you
have
doubtless
abundant
proof
to
support
these
strange
charges
marjorie
kennedy
stood
up
among
us
tall
like
a
lily
flower
and
she
held
her
head
erect
hear
you
john
of
cassillis
and
all
men
she
said
i
will
tell
my
tale
of
my
own
griefs
i
will
say
naught
for
in
no
realm
do
a
woman
s
count
for
a
docken
s
value
it
is
enough
that
my
father
in
the
simplicity
of
his
heart
gave
me
to
this
man
as
an
innocent
sacrifice
is
cast
to
a
monster
to
appease
his
ravening
these
many
months
i
dwelt
in
this
man
s
castle
i
have
been
prisoned
starved
all
the
mures
in
auchendrayne
could
neither
prevail
to
break
my
resolve
nor
yet
could
they
close
my
mouth
concerning
the
things
which
i
saw
and
now
i
that
am
no
more
bound
to
this
man
than
i
was
when
he
took
me
out
of
my
father
s
house
of
who
have
never
looked
upon
him
that
is
my
wedded
husband
save
with
eyes
of
hatred
never
lain
by
his
side
stand
here
to
denounce
james
mure
and
his
father
for
black
cruel
repeated
defenceless
murder
murder
upon
the
marjorie
kennedy
rang
out
the
last
words
like
a
trumpet
not
even
the
earl
s
herald
could
have
been
heard
further
all
men
hear
my
tale
before
they
judge
she
went
on
it
was
the
morn
before
my
father
s
from
my
window
in
the
house
of
auchendrayne
i
had
seen
this
man
and
his
father
with
thomas
of
drummurchie
and
walter
of
cloncaird
come
and
go
all
day
with
trappings
and
harness
because
they
knew
that
the
time
was
nigh
at
hand
for
my
father
s
riding
to
edinburgh
it
chanced
that
i
was
looking
down
through
the
bars
of
my
for
there
was
little
else
to
do
in
the
house
of
auchendrayne
it
was
about
eleven
of
the
clock
when
i
saw
a
young
lad
dusty
from
head
to
foot
venture
a
little
way
within
the
castle
yett
and
stand
as
one
that
looks
about
him
not
knowing
where
to
turn
the
court
was
void
and
silent
and
the
lad
seemed
distressed
but
while
he
thus
stood
james
mure
and
his
father
came
down
the
turnpike
stair
and
stepped
talking
whisperingly
together
out
into
the
flagged
court
it
was
john
mure
the
elder
who
first
saw
the
lad
and
called
him
i
saw
the
boy
put
a
letter
into
his
hand
the
which
he
opened
carefully
and
read
passing
it
to
his
son
who
read
also
then
james
mure
stepped
back
and
called
thomas
of
drummurchie
and
cloncaird
they
came
both
of
them
and
the
four
bent
their
heads
together
over
the
writing
then
in
a
little
john
mure
closed
the
letter
again
as
it
had
been
and
gave
it
with
certain
charges
to
the
saw
you
that
letter
or
knew
you
aught
of
its
contents
asked
the
earl
john
nay
said
marjorie
kennedy
my
window
was
too
far
from
them
and
they
spoke
low
and
with
privity
among
then
was
my
time
my
lord
bailzie
of
carrick
said
i
may
it
please
you
it
was
i
launcelot
kennedy
of
kirrieoch
some
time
squire
to
sir
thomas
of
culzean
who
sent
that
letter
i
sent
it
from
maybole
by
the
hands
of
william
dalrymple
the
lad
whom
the
lady
marjorie
saw
come
within
the
castle
yett
of
the
dominie
stood
forward
and
it
was
i
robert
mure
schoolmaster
in
the
town
of
maybole
who
wrote
that
letter
i
wrote
it
as
launcelot
kennedy
set
me
the
words
for
he
is
a
man
readier
with
the
sword
than
the
pen
though
he
hath
some
small
skill
even
of
that
but
that
day
he
was
hot
upon
his
game
of
golf
which
i
hold
to
be
but
a
foolish
sport
which
rapidly
obscures
the
senses
so
i
having
as
is
mine
office
pen
in
hand
wrote
the
letter
for
him
also
i
sent
one
william
dalrymple
called
for
a
nickname
willie
of
the
with
it
to
john
mure
at
his
house
of
auchendrayne
i
bear
witness
that
after
a
space
this
boy
came
back
with
the
story
that
he
had
found
john
mure
from
home
but
when
we
charged
it
upon
him
that
the
letter
had
been
thumbed
and
opened
he
grew
confused
and
confessed
that
he
had
been
compelled
to
bring
back
that
message
by
mure
himself
who
had
broken
the
seal
and
given
it
again
to
him
even
as
the
lady
marjorie
has
and
what
further
proof
do
you
offer
of
all
this
asked
the
earl
bending
forward
with
eagerness
to
catch
the
dominie
s
words
the
dominie
put
his
hand
into
the
inner
pocket
of
his
coat
and
pulled
out
among
various
pipe
reeds
and
scraps
of
writing
a
letter
which
he
kept
carefully
folded
in
a
leathern
case
by
itself
there
is
the
thing
itself
may
it
please
your
lordship
to
look
upon
it
said
he
calmly
and
as
soon
as
he
had
said
that
the
earl
rose
eagerly
to
see
the
famous
missive
which
had
drought
about
all
this
turmoil
there
was
also
a
stir
among
the
folk
that
were
gathered
about
for
all
strained
their
eyes
as
if
they
could
see
that
which
was
going
on
and
read
the
writing
at
that
distance
it
is
a
most
notable
proof
said
the
earl
and
so
we
receive
it
but
can
you
not
produce
the
lad
william
dalrymple
that
can
we
not
said
the
lady
marjorie
but
i
and
i
alone
can
tell
you
all
the
story
of
his
even
than
the
other
because
done
to
a
young
lad
against
whom
even
these
cruel
murderers
could
allege
no
and
again
there
could
be
heard
the
sound
of
men
settling
down
to
deep
attention
throughout
all
the
crowd
at
the
diet
of
justiceaire
and
they
even
crowded
in
a
little
past
the
pennons
so
that
the
heralds
had
to
beat
upon
the
ground
with
the
butts
of
their
halbards
as
though
to
bruise
their
feet
before
they
could
force
them
to
give
back
but
james
mure
abode
stupidlike
and
sullen
before
his
judge
while
his
accuser
stood
not
three
feet
from
him
and
told
her
story
it
was
just
when
the
bruit
of
my
father
s
death
began
to
go
abroad
against
the
auchendraynes
so
marjorie
kennedy
again
took
up
her
tale
and
when
john
mure
the
elder
began
to
fear
that
the
matter
of
the
letter
would
be
made
manifest
that
i
again
saw
the
little
lad
william
dalrymple
one
night
i
observed
james
mure
leading
him
rudely
by
the
neck
into
one
of
the
barred
cells
which
underlie
the
stables
and
to
that
place
with
his
own
hands
he
carried
food
and
water
once
every
day
thereafter
then
came
to
visit
john
mure
one
sir
robert
montgomery
the
laird
of
skelmorlie
and
with
him
they
sent
the
lad
on
pretext
to
be
a
page
at
his
house
of
loch
ranza
which
he
keeps
for
the
king
s
hunting
lodge
on
the
isle
of
arran
what
befell
there
i
can
not
tell
but
it
was
not
many
weeks
before
william
dalrymple
was
back
again
and
this
time
they
sent
him
as
he
told
me
afterwards
to
the
lowlands
of
holland
there
to
serve
in
the
lord
buccleuch
s
regiment
which
first
as
a
trumpeter
and
after
as
a
soldier
he
did
nevertheless
being
but
young
he
wearied
easily
of
the
stress
and
chance
of
foreign
war
and
so
returned
as
before
then
when
in
spite
of
all
the
boy
came
back
and
it
was
told
to
john
mure
that
william
dalrymple
was
again
in
his
native
town
he
was
neither
to
hold
nor
to
bind
he
neither
rested
nor
slept
till
he
had
again
brought
the
lad
to
his
house
where
he
abode
for
some
weeks
but
not
so
closely
shut
up
as
before
so
that
it
was
often
my
chance
to
see
him
as
he
came
and
went
about
the
court
and
even
to
converse
with
him
but
in
a
little
while
he
vanished
and
from
that
time
i
saw
him
no
more
now
the
bitterness
of
my
life
and
my
desire
to
bring
to
justice
the
murderers
of
my
father
caused
me
at
last
to
quit
the
house
of
auchendrayne
for
now
i
held
as
i
thought
the
strings
which
would
draw
mine
enemies
to
their
doom
so
upon
a
night
i
had
it
set
to
escape
she
that
was
my
maid
helping
me
with
one
other
that
was
a
body
servant
of
auchendrayne
s
and
my
s
lover
when
i
came
out
i
found
a
pony
waiting
for
me
and
it
was
my
purpose
to
ride
to
the
house
of
my
kinsman
the
earl
of
cassillis
but
as
i
journeyed
what
was
my
great
affrightment
to
come
upon
a
company
of
two
who
rode
some
little
way
before
me
i
could
easily
have
turned
and
ridden
another
way
but
for
something
which
came
into
my
heart
to
make
me
follow
on
for
in
a
trice
i
recognised
the
riders
to
be
john
mure
and
his
son
the
father
being
wrapped
in
his
great
cloak
of
grey
as
is
his
custom
and
by
this
i
knew
him
so
i
followed
them
but
not
very
near
and
because
my
beast
was
a
stable
companion
of
their
horses
he
went
after
of
his
own
by
the
first
breaking
touch
or
morn
we
came
to
a
waste
place
upon
the
edge
of
the
sea
where
in
a
secret
dell
i
dismounted
and
tied
my
pony
to
a
which
shot
out
over
a
sandy
hollow
then
yet
more
secretly
i
followed
them
across
the
sandhills
and
on
the
very
edge
on
the
links
where
the
turf
ceases
underfoot
and
there
is
only
sand
john
mure
and
his
son
this
man
before
you
waited
for
a
while
they
stood
listening
and
talking
low
together
so
that
though
i
lay
hidden
behind
a
whin
which
overgrew
a
little
turfy
dell
i
could
neither
hear
what
was
said
nor
yet
by
reason
of
the
bareness
of
the
sand
dared
i
to
adventure
nearer
them
but
they
waited
not
long
before
one
came
down
to
meet
them
over
the
turf
bringing
a
lad
with
him
then
immediately
james
mure
whistled
a
call
and
the
reply
came
back
in
like
manner
you
are
late
james
bannatyne
i
heard
john
mure
the
elder
say
what
has
taigled
you
my
sea
cloth
is
not
so
well
accustomed
to
night
ploys
as
your
cloak
of
grey
the
man
growled
as
he
came
along
sullenly
enough
then
the
three
men
of
them
walked
a
little
apart
and
came
in
their
circuit
very
near
to
the
hollow
where
i
lay
while
down
on
the
shore
the
young
lad
stood
and
yawned
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
like
one
that
shivers
and
wishes
he
were
back
in
bed
nor
had
he
i
am
confident
even
then
any
thought
of
evil
but
the
talk
of
the
three
as
i
heard
it
in
snatches
was
black
and
bitter
the
darkest
counsel
was
that
of
the
man
who
stands
here
for
james
mure
said
only
the
dead
are
no
and
again
we
have
had
enough
of
this
silly
endless
work
let
the
earth
hide
him
or
the
sea
keep
be
done
with
it
now
john
mure
the
elder
and
the
man
whom
they
called
james
bannatyne
seemed
at
the
least
inclined
to
discuss
milder
councils
bannatyne
was
all
for
sending
the
lad
over
to
ireland
and
john
mure
listened
as
though
he
might
be
persuaded
yet
i
knew
his
guile
for
even
when
he
stood
with
his
back
to
his
son
i
saw
him
lift
up
his
hand
for
a
signal
and
with
that
and
no
more
james
mure
rushed
at
the
poor
lad
and
overbore
him
to
the
ground
and
there
upon
the
sands
of
the
seashore
this
james
mure
set
his
knee
on
the
bairnie
s
breast
and
with
bloody
hands
choked
and
worried
him
till
there
was
no
life
left
in
the
lad
and
his
father
also
went
and
held
the
lad
when
he
fought
his
white
reverend
beard
waggling
in
the
wind
till
at
last
the
bairn
lay
still
but
james
bannatyne
stood
by
and
clasped
his
hands
as
the
boy
tossed
and
struggled
for
his
dear
young
life
for
i
think
he
was
now
mainly
sorry
that
he
had
brought
the
lad
to
his
death
then
i
could
stand
the
vileness
no
longer
without
protest
so
i
marjorie
kennedy
even
though
i
well
knew
that
they
would
certainly
do
the
like
to
me
rose
from
my
in
the
and
cried
murderers
cease
from
your
cruel
work
god
will
come
and
judge
you
whereat
john
mure
came
hastily
to
where
i
stood
and
gripped
me
you
have
seen
all
he
said
then
you
must
die
let
us
see
if
god
will
come
and
help
you
so
i
defied
them
to
do
their
worst
with
me
for
madness
had
come
upon
me
at
the
sight
of
the
monstrous
cruelty
to
an
innocent
bairn
and
for
the
time
i
cared
not
what
should
become
of
myself
then
i
called
to
james
bannatyne
requiring
of
him
to
declare
if
he
too
were
a
murderer
like
the
other
fiends
and
to
call
upon
him
to
protect
the
innocent
we
will
settle
all
that
in
the
one
payment
mistress
said
john
mure
to
me
so
by
force
i
was
compelled
to
abide
with
them
john
mure
the
elder
taking
me
cruelly
by
the
arm
while
he
sent
the
others
to
cast
into
the
sea
the
dead
body
of
the
lad
but
even
so
oft
as
they
threw
him
in
so
often
the
waves
cast
him
out
again
upon
the
shore
and
that
though
there
was
a
strong
wind
off
the
land
which
blew
the
tops
from
the
waves
and
drave
the
sand
in
hissing
streams
into
the
sea
so
when
for
the
third
time
the
boy
had
been
tumbled
upon
the
beach
john
mure
bade
bannatyne
bring
his
boat
saying
that
they
would
cast
the
loon
afloat
out
in
the
deeps
of
the
bay
so
that
the
outerly
wind
might
drive
him
to
the
coast
of
ireland
after
that
they
would
return
betimes
to
attend
to
other
which
i
took
him
to
mean
that
they
would
do
that
for
me
which
i
had
so
lately
seen
them
do
for
the
young
boy
and
indeed
i
looked
for
no
other
mercy
at
their
brutal
hands
so
in
a
little
space
james
bannatyne
brought
his
boat
and
with
hard
endeavour
they
launched
her
and
compelled
me
to
accompany
them
there
was
a
strong
wind
from
the
east
and
we
were
soon
blown
far
out
into
the
wild
sea
there
they
cast
the
body
of
the
lad
overboard
and
turned
to
make
again
for
the
shore
but
though
they
all
took
oars
and
laboured
in
rowing
sames
bannatyne
taking
twain
they
could
make
nothing
of
it
but
were
rather
worse
than
they
had
been
before
they
started
so
they
began
to
be
afraid
and
i
was
right
glad
thereat
for
i
looked
that
the
doom
of
the
twice
guilty
murderers
should
speedily
come
and
so
the
pain
of
this
trial
and
my
witnessing
might
have
been
spared
now
the
mures
were
the
most
fearful
of
the
storm
being
as
it
were
inland
bred
it
was
all
that
james
bannatyne
could
get
them
to
do
to
sit
still
ye
will
wreck
us
all
and
send
us
before
our
maker
with
the
lad
s
body
not
cold
in
the
water
and
his
spirit
there
to
meet
us
at
the
judgment
seat
said
he
and
with
that
john
mure
rose
in
his
place
and
in
despite
of
the
swaying
and
plunging
of
the
ship
into
which
the
water
came
lashing
he
cried
out
the
wraith
the
wraith
it
is
following
are
doomed
and
lo
when
i
looked
i
saw
that
which
chilled
me
more
than
the
whistling
tempest
and
if
it
feared
me
to
the
soul
judge
ye
what
it
must
have
been
to
the
guilty
men
whose
hands
were
yet
red
with
the
blood
of
the
innocent
for
there
not
thirty
yards
behind
the
boat
and
following
strongly
in
our
wake
as
a
stark
swimmer
might
do
now
tumbling
and
leaping
in
the
wash
of
the
seas
and
now
lunging
forward
like
a
boat
that
is
towed
was
the
murdered
boy
himself
and
thus
he
followed
with
a
smile
on
his
face
or
what
looked
like
it
in
the
uncertain
light
of
the
morning
so
with
that
the
men
who
rowed
fell
on
their
faces
and
could
not
look
any
more
though
the
prodigy
followed
us
a
good
while
only
john
mure
sat
wrapped
in
his
grey
cloak
steering
the
boat
and
i
sat
beside
him
little
by
little
we
came
to
the
land
but
as
it
had
been
sideways
having
been
driven
by
the
wind
to
the
other
side
of
the
wide
bay
there
we
disembarked
and
the
mures
kept
me
close
all
that
day
in
a
place
of
strength
on
the
seashore
till
it
was
night
they
plied
me
to
promise
silence
for
they
believed
that
i
would
keep
my
word
if
once
i
pledged
it
they
offered
me
all
that
they
had
of
honour
or
place
in
the
country
there
was
nothing
they
said
that
was
not
within
the
power
of
their
compassing
for
since
the
death
of
gilbert
of
bargany
the
king
needed
someone
in
carrick
strong
enough
to
count
spears
with
the
earl
of
cassillis
but
very
steadfastly
i
withstood
them
declaring
that
i
should
certainly
reveal
all
their
murder
and
treachery
both
in
the
matter
of
the
death
of
my
lather
and
in
that
which
i
had
seen
done
upon
the
sands
to
the
young
lad
william
dalrymple
so
finally
seeing
that
they
could
prevail
nothing
they
went
out
and
kept
silent
watch
by
the
door
till
the
even
then
as
soon
as
it
was
dark
they
opened
the
lock
and
bade
me
come
forth
and
this
i
did
knowing
for
a
certainty
that
my
last
hour
was
come
yet
my
life
had
not
been
so
pleasant
to
me
as
to
be
very
greatly
precious
so
i
followed
them
with
no
very
ill
will
nor
yet
greatly
concerned
then
on
the
craggy
top
they
gave
me
for
the
sake
of
their
house
and
good
name
as
they
said
one
more
chance
to
swear
silence
this
i
would
not
accept
and
they
being
startled
with
the
approach
of
a
boat
upon
the
water
which
steered
towards
our
light
pinioned
my
arms
and
thrusting
something
into
my
mouth
forthwith
threw
me
over
the
cliff
into
the
sea
and
as
to
the
mode
of
my
rescuing
and
standing
here
before
the
earl
my
cousin
young
launcelot
kennedy
my
father
s
squire
can
tell
and
also
my
sister
and
robert
mure
of
man
in
the
wide
she
ceased
suddenly
after
this
long
account
of
her
adventuring
and
the
folk
stood
still
in
amazement
having
held
their
breath
while
she
told
of
the
killing
of
young
william
dalrymple
and
of
the
wraith
and
then
there
arose
a
great
cry
from
all
the
people
tear
the
murderer
in
him
kill
him
so
that
cassillis
had
to
summon
to
keep
back
that
throng
of
furious
folk
for
the
death
of
my
master
seemed
to
them
but
a
little
thing
and
venial
compared
to
the
killing
of
a
lad
like
william
dalrymple
and
this
was
because
the
people
of
carrick
had
been
used
all
their
days
to
family
feuds
and
the
expiation
of
blood
by
blood
the
earl
was
about
to
call
me
up
to
give
an
account
of
my
part
in
the
affair
and
i
was
preparing
myself
to
make
a
good
and
creditable
thing
which
i
have
all
my
life
studied
to
there
was
heard
a
mighty
crying
in
the
rear
of
the
bailzie
court
men
cried
he
comes
he
comes
as
though
it
had
been
some
great
one
and
everybody
turned
their
heads
to
the
no
small
annoyance
of
earl
john
who
when
on
his
hill
of
justice
loved
not
that
men
should
look
in
any
other
direction
than
his
own
the
ranks
of
the
opened
and
there
strode
into
the
square
of
trial
which
was
guarded
by
the
pennons
of
blue
and
gold
at
the
four
but
john
mure
of
auchendrayne
himself
wearing
the
same
cloak
of
grey
and
broad
plumed
hat
which
had
been
his
wont
when
he
went
abroad
upon
dangerous
quests
with
him
was
another
shorter
man
whose
face
was
for
the
time
being
almost
hidden
for
he
had
pulled
the
cloak
he
was
wearing
close
about
his
mouth
he
walked
with
an
odd
jolt
or
roll
in
his
gait
and
his
breeches
were
exceedingly
broad
in
the
basement
it
was
small
wonder
that
we
stood
aghast
at
this
sudden
compearing
of
the
arch
criminal
whose
misdeeds
throughout
all
the
countryside
had
filled
the
cup
of
his
wickedness
to
the
brim
seize
him
cried
the
earl
pointing
directly
at
john
mure
and
his
bailzie
s
men
took
him
roughly
by
the
shoulders
and
set
him
beside
his
son
then
it
was
to
be
noticed
as
the
two
stood
together
that
there
was
a
great
likeness
between
father
and
son
the
elder
man
possessed
the
same
features
without
any
evident
differences
in
outline
but
so
informed
was
his
face
with
intelligence
and
power
that
what
was
simply
dull
cruelty
and
loutishness
in
the
one
became
the
guile
of
statecraft
in
the
other
wherefore
my
lord
earl
cried
john
mure
of
auchendrayne
is
this
violence
done
to
me
and
to
the
heir
of
my
house
i
demand
to
know
concerning
what
we
are
called
in
question
and
by
whom
then
the
earl
of
cassillis
answered
him
john
mure
of
auchendrayne
know
then
that
you
are
charged
along
with
this
your
son
with
the
bloody
murder
of
sir
thomas
kennedy
of
culzean
tutor
of
cassillis
and
also
with
the
cruel
death
of
william
dalrymple
the
young
lad
who
brought
you
the
message
to
your
own
house
of
auchendrayne
telling
at
what
hour
the
tutor
should
pass
the
trysting
place
where
he
was
by
you
and
yours
foully
assaulted
and
and
who
declares
these
things
cried
mure
boldly
with
a
bearing
more
like
that
of
an
innocent
man
than
that
of
any
criminal
that
ever
i
saw
the
earl
bade
us
who
had
accused
them
so
justly
to
stand
forth
then
john
mure
eyed
us
with
a
grave
and
amused
contempt
my
son
s
false
wife
whom
sorrow
has
caused
to
dote
concerning
her
father
s
rantipole
sister
and
her
paramour
a
loutish
dominie
of
maybole
a
crippledick
and
piping
that
travelled
with
are
the
accusers
of
john
mure
of
auchendrayne
they
have
seen
heard
noted
what
others
have
been
ignorant
of
nay
rather
is
it
not
clear
that
they
have
collogued
together
conspiring
to
bear
false
witness
against
me
and
the
sake
of
the
frantic
splenetic
madness
of
her
who
is
my
son
s
fugitive
wife
whose
wrongs
exist
only
in
her
own
you
have
forgotten
me
said
robert
harburgh
quietly
stepping
forward
i
know
you
well
said
john
mure
and
i
would
have
remembered
you
had
you
been
worth
remembering
you
are
my
lord
of
cassillis
s
squire
and
erstwhile
a
gay
ruffler
now
married
to
the
grieve
s
daughter
at
well
said
harburgh
and
what
of
that
can
a
man
not
be
all
that
and
yet
tell
the
truth
that
i
leave
to
one
who
is
greater
to
judge
said
john
mure
and
i
do
judge
john
mure
cried
the
earl
rising
in
his
chair
of
state
i
judge
you
to
be
a
man
rebel
and
mansworn
a
traitor
and
a
for
a
score
of
years
ye
have
keeped
all
this
realm
of
carrick
in
a
turmoil
you
and
they
that
have
partaken
with
you
in
your
evil
loud
swelling
words
are
but
wind
my
lord
earl
of
cassillis
answered
mure
of
auchendrayne
a
dry
smile
of
contempt
coming
over
his
features
now
i
will
show
thee
bold
said
the
earl
fiercely
whether
i
speak
the
words
of
a
dotard
or
no
forward
men
take
him
up
and
bind
him
methinks
we
have
yet
engines
within
the
castle
of
dunure
that
can
make
him
declare
the
rights
of
this
murderous
treason
then
i
rejoiced
not
for
the
torture
of
our
enemy
but
because
at
last
the
earl
saw
fully
with
our
eyes
and
would
right
us
against
the
cruel
oppressor
of
marjorie
kennedy
and
for
the
murder
of
my
gentle
and
courteous
master
but
ere
the
men
could
carry
out
the
orders
of
the
earl
the
man
who
had
accompanied
auchendrayne
and
who
had
all
the
while
stood
still
and
watchful
dropped
his
plaid
which
like
a
mask
he
had
held
beneath
his
eyes
he
was
a
fleshy
man
with
no
great
dignity
of
face
and
with
a
weak
mouth
that
dribbled
perpetually
at
the
side
as
if
the
tongue
were
too
large
for
it
he
wore
a
slashed
doublet
very
full
at
the
sleeves
baggy
trunks
and
a
sword
in
a
plain
scabbard
hanging
at
his
side
i
saw
nothing
further
very
particular
about
the
man
save
the
shambling
inward
bend
of
his
knees
but
it
was
with
dumb
amaze
that
the
earl
looked
at
him
standing
there
arrested
in
the
act
of
pointing
with
his
hand
at
john
mure
he
stood
with
his
jaw
fallen
and
his
eyes
starting
from
his
head
the
king
the
king
he
muttered
in
astonishment
looking
about
him
like
one
distracted
ay
baron
bailzie
of
carrick
even
your
king
said
the
man
in
the
wide
trunk
hosen
come
to
see
how
his
sometime
high
treasurer
of
scotland
executes
just
judgment
in
his
own
regality
the
earl
came
quickly
to
himself
and
he
and
all
the
people
took
off
their
hats
he
stepped
down
and
made
his
obeisance
to
the
king
bending
humbly
upon
his
knee
then
he
ushered
the
king
to
the
throne
whereon
he
himself
had
been
sitting
and
took
a
lower
seat
beside
adam
boyd
of
penkill
his
assessor
in
ordinary
the
king
rose
to
speak
my
lord
earl
and
gentlemen
of
carrick
he
said
with
dignity
enough
but
with
a
thick
and
rolling
accent
as
if
his
tongue
had
been
indeed
too
big
i
know
this
case
to
the
bottom
i
am
fully
persuaded
of
the
innocence
of
our
trusty
councillor
john
mure
of
is
besides
of
the
fraternity
of
learned
men
and
one
that
hath
a
history
of
this
realm
in
script
ready
for
the
printers
wherein
he
does
full
justice
both
to
myself
and
to
my
noble
predecessors
he
hath
as
i
should
nominate
it
an
exactness
of
expression
and
a
perspicuity
of
argument
that
have
never
been
matched
in
the
land
i
propose
shortly
to
make
him
my
historiographer
royal
also
i
the
king
do
know
him
to
be
a
man
well
affected
to
the
right
ecclesiastical
ruling
of
this
kingdom
and
minded
to
help
me
with
the
due
ordering
of
the
king
puffed
and
blew
after
his
speech
and
we
and
all
that
were
there
stood
silent
for
to
most
of
us
he
might
as
well
have
spoken
in
the
hebrew
of
which
he
boasted
himself
so
great
a
master
then
he
went
on
i
have
left
my
lord
mar
and
my
retinue
some
way
in
the
rear
for
we
go
to
hunt
the
deer
in
whatever
forest
the
goodwill
of
our
loyal
subjects
may
put
at
our
you
are
right
welcome
my
liege
said
the
earl
john
starting
up
and
standing
bareheaded
to
my
hunting
lodges
and
retinue
both
in
the
forest
of
buchan
and
also
at
my
house
of
the
king
bent
towards
him
royally
for
james
the
sixth
had
manners
when
he
liked
to
show
in
truth
was
not
always
i
thank
you
trusty
councillor
said
he
it
is
nobly
and
generously
which
also
marked
your
tenure
of
the
office
of
high
treasurer
of
scotland
but
for
the
judging
of
this
our
worthy
subject
i
propose
to
take
that
upon
myself
being
wholly
persuaded
of
his
innocence
and
as
for
those
that
have
falsely
accused
him
let
the
men
underlie
my
will
in
the
prison
most
convenient
and
the
women
be
warded
meantime
in
their
own
house
and
castle
till
i
cause
to
be
known
my
whole
pleasure
in
the
we
stood
aghast
and
knew
not
what
to
say
so
completely
had
auchendrayne
turned
our
flank
with
the
king
not
a
word
had
we
found
to
allege
when
the
officers
of
the
court
to
whom
the
charge
was
given
came
to
put
the
iron
rings
on
our
wrists
and
march
us
off
even
as
we
had
hoped
and
expected
to
see
auchendrayne
and
his
son
taken
and
as
the
dominie
and
i
were
haled
away
we
could
see
auchendrayne
bending
suavely
over
the
king
s
high
seat
and
his
majesty
inclining
to
him
and
talking
privately
back
and
forth
with
many
becks
and
uncouth
graces
such
as
he
had
used
in
his
address
to
the
earl
and
his
people
he
is
the
very
devil
himself
said
the
dominie
meaning
auchendrayne
and
not
the
king
he
hath
not
halted
to
cozen
the
greatest
man
in
this
realm
with
his
lying
tongue
but
i
said
nothing
for
what
had
i
to
say
i
had
seen
lands
honours
love
and
consideration
vanish
at
a
stroke
judgment
of
the
court
of
the
baron
bailzie
of
carrick
broke
up
in
confusion
it
had
been
arranged
that
we
should
ride
all
together
to
the
north
even
to
culzean
where
his
majesty
might
have
due
entertainment
provided
for
him
nearer
than
at
my
lord
s
castle
of
cassillis
also
it
was
upon
this
shoreside
road
that
he
had
left
the
earl
of
mar
and
the
favourite
attendants
with
whom
james
the
sixth
ordinarily
sallied
forth
to
the
hunting
those
of
the
auchendrayne
and
bargany
party
who
hated
us
clamoured
that
the
dominie
and
i
should
be
left
warded
in
the
place
of
girvan
where
our
enemies
would
soon
have
ta
en
their
will
of
us
but
robert
harburgh
moved
my
lord
who
went
about
dour
and
heartsick
for
the
failure
of
his
plans
in
the
matter
of
the
mures
to
have
us
brought
on
with
purpose
to
lodge
us
within
the
ancient
strengths
of
dunure
so
that
as
i
rode
at
the
tail
of
the
king
s
retinue
i
was
yet
near
enough
to
have
sight
of
marjorie
and
nell
who
rode
before
us
and
this
was
some
comfort
to
my
heart
the
way
lay
for
miles
along
the
seashore
which
is
here
sandy
with
a
broad
belt
of
fine
hard
beach
whereon
the
horses
went
daintily
and
well
while
at
our
left
elbows
the
sea
murmured
the
king
and
john
mure
rode
first
and
his
majesty
constantly
broke
into
loud
mirth
at
some
witty
saying
of
his
companion
s
level
with
them
but
riding
moodily
apart
was
the
earl
while
james
mure
the
younger
rode
alone
by
himself
behind
these
three
i
groaned
within
me
for
the
exaltation
of
our
enemy
and
at
the
shortsightedness
of
anointed
kings
is
there
a
god
in
heaven
i
cried
aloud
thus
to
make
no
sign
while
the
devil
is
driving
all
things
headlong
to
destruction
according
to
his
own
devising
there
was
a
god
in
heaven
for
quick
as
an
echo
that
answers
from
the
wood
there
before
us
upon
the
sands
just
where
the
levels
had
been
overflowed
at
the
last
tide
lay
a
thing
which
halted
the
advancing
cavalcade
as
suddenly
as
an
army
with
banners
the
men
crowded
about
and
having
in
the
excitement
forgotten
us
their
charges
we
also
were
permitted
to
look
and
this
is
what
we
saw
there
upon
the
ribbed
sea
sand
lay
the
dead
body
of
the
boy
william
dalrymple
i
knew
him
at
a
glance
for
all
that
so
much
had
come
and
gone
since
that
day
when
i
played
at
the
golf
game
upon
the
green
of
maybole
he
lay
with
his
arms
stretched
away
from
his
sides
his
face
turned
over
and
one
cheek
dented
deeply
into
the
sand
it
was
a
pitiful
sight
yet
the
lad
was
not
greatly
and
as
he
had
been
and
now
brought
to
cross
the
path
of
the
unjust
at
the
very
nick
of
time
by
the
manifest
judgment
and
providence
of
god
what
means
this
said
the
king
some
poor
drowned
sailor
boy
let
us
avoid
for
of
all
things
he
loved
not
gruesome
sights
nor
the
colour
of
blood
but
james
mure
suddenly
cried
aloud
at
the
vision
as
if
he
had
been
stricken
with
pain
and
as
he
did
so
his
father
looked
at
him
as
though
he
would
have
slain
him
so
devilish
was
his
glance
of
hate
and
contempt
but
a
woman
who
had
come
running
after
the
party
now
rushed
to
the
front
she
gave
a
loud
scream
and
frantic
when
she
saw
the
tossed
little
body
lying
all
abroad
upon
the
sand
my
willie
my
ain
son
willie
she
cried
for
it
was
meg
dalrymple
all
her
ignorant
rudeness
seemed
to
fade
away
in
the
presence
of
death
and
as
she
lifted
the
poor
mishandled
head
that
had
been
her
son
s
each
of
us
felt
that
she
grew
akin
to
our
own
mothers
widowed
and
bereaved
for
i
think
that
which
touches
us
most
in
the
grief
of
a
widow
is
not
our
feeling
for
a
particular
woman
but
our
obligation
to
the
mother
of
all
flesh
so
when
meg
dalrymple
lifted
her
son
s
head
it
might
have
been
a
mourning
queen
with
a
dead
kingling
upon
her
knee
my
ain
my
ain
lad
she
cried
see
lammie
but
i
loved
ye
ye
were
the
widow
s
ae
son
than
the
mountain
roe
mair
gleg
than
the
falcon
that
sits
yonder
on
the
king
s
wrist
ye
were
the
hope
o
thy
mither
s
life
and
they
hae
slain
ye
killed
my
bonny
wean
that
never
did
harm
to
nae
she
undid
a
kerchief
from
about
the
white
swollen
neck
of
her
son
kens
ony
man
that
image
and
superscription
said
she
pointing
to
an
embroidered
crest
upon
it
john
mure
strode
forward
hastily
he
had
grown
as
pale
as
death
give
it
me
i
will
pass
it
to
his
majesty
he
said
holding
out
his
hand
for
it
but
the
woman
leaped
up
fiercely
na
she
said
the
butcher
kens
his
knife
but
he
would
only
hide
it
in
the
day
of
trial
i
will
give
it
to
my
ain
and
she
put
the
napkin
into
the
hands
of
the
earl
of
cassillis
who
looked
at
it
with
the
most
minute
attention
this
kerchief
said
the
earl
gravely
has
the
crest
and
motto
of
john
mure
of
the
king
looked
staggered
and
bewildered
let
all
dismount
till
we
try
further
of
this
thing
he
said
but
john
mure
would
have
had
him
go
on
saying
that
it
was
yet
more
of
the
plot
but
the
king
would
not
now
hearken
to
him
for
he
was
an
obstinate
man
and
oftentime
he
would
listen
to
no
reason
though
his
ear
was
ever
open
enough
to
flattery
besides
he
thought
himself
to
be
the
wisest
man
in
all
the
islands
and
kingdoms
of
the
even
than
solomon
the
son
of
david
so
his
majesty
commanded
his
inclination
and
went
up
to
the
body
there
was
also
a
rope
around
the
neck
with
a
long
end
which
was
embedded
in
the
sand
with
his
own
hand
the
king
drew
this
out
he
held
it
up
kens
any
man
this
length
of
rope
he
asked
looking
about
now
one
strand
of
is
like
another
as
two
peas
but
this
was
our
solomon
s
way
of
find
out
the
insignificant
and
then
pretend
that
it
told
him
a
mighty
deal
yet
it
so
happened
that
there
was
a
man
there
from
out
of
the
shoreside
of
girvan
he
was
a
coastwise
sailor
and
he
took
the
rope
in
his
hand
this
rope
he
said
turning
it
about
every
way
is
irish
made
and
has
been
used
to
tie
bundles
of
neat
and
who
again
asked
the
as
i
do
admit
who
upon
this
coast
trades
with
ireland
in
the
commodity
of
neat
hides
there
are
but
myself
and
james
bannatyne
of
chapeldonnan
replied
the
man
honestly
and
promptly
and
this
is
not
your
rope
said
the
king
nay
said
the
man
i
would
not
buy
a
pennyworth
of
irish
hemp
so
long
as
i
could
twine
the
hemp
of
not
even
to
hang
an
irishman
would
i
do
it
this
is
james
bannatyne
s
rope
then
said
the
king
bring
hither
james
of
chapeldonnan
and
they
brought
him
he
stood
forth
much
feared
indeed
but
taking
the
matter
dourly
like
the
burly
ruffian
he
was
nevertheless
when
put
to
the
question
he
denied
the
rope
and
that
in
spite
of
all
threats
of
torture
yet
i
could
see
that
the
king
was
greatly
shaken
in
his
opinion
and
knew
not
what
to
think
for
when
john
mure
drew
near
to
touch
his
arm
and
as
before
say
somewhat
in
his
private
ear
the
king
drew
hastily
away
and
looked
at
auchendrayne
s
hand
as
though
there
had
been
pollution
upon
it
so
i
knew
that
his
opinion
was
wavering
also
the
poor
body
in
the
mother
s
arms
daunted
him
suddenly
he
clapped
his
hands
together
and
became
exceedingly
joyous
and
alert
i
have
it
he
cried
the
ordeal
of
touch
it
is
god
s
ordinary
and
manifest
way
of
vindicating
his
justice
here
is
the
dead
body
of
the
slain
here
are
all
the
accused
and
the
accusers
let
it
be
equally
done
let
all
touch
the
body
for
the
revealing
of
the
secrets
of
the
hearts
of
wicked
then
john
mure
laughed
and
scoffed
saying
that
it
was
but
a
freit
a
foolish
opinion
an
old
wives
fable
but
for
all
his
quirksome
guile
he
had
gotten
this
time
very
mightily
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
king
for
his
majesty
was
just
mad
with
belief
in
such
things
as
omens
and
miracles
of
god
s
providence
so
the
king
shook
him
off
and
said
it
is
my
royal
will
that
all
who
are
tainted
with
the
matter
shall
immediately
touch
or
be
held
and
the
saying
comforted
king
james
being
as
it
were
easily
pleased
with
his
own
words
and
plaiks
so
they
brought
us
forward
from
among
the
crowd
bound
as
we
were
and
first
of
all
i
touched
fearlessly
the
poor
dead
body
of
the
lad
yet
it
was
with
some
strange
feeling
though
i
knew
well
that
i
was
wholly
innocent
but
yet
i
could
not
forget
that
something
untoward
might
happen
and
then
to
this
fair
world
and
all
the
pleasant
stir
of
life
within
it
then
after
me
the
dominie
marjorie
and
nell
doing
it
with
set
faces
and
strange
eyes
it
was
now
the
turns
of
the
real
murderers
and
my
heart
beat
little
and
fast
to
see
what
should
happen
let
auchendrayne
the
younger
touch
first
being
the
more
directly
accused
cried
the
king
but
james
mure
seemed
to
flame
out
suddenly
distract
like
a
madman
being
taken
to
bethlem
he
cried
out
no
no
i
will
not
touch
i
declare
that
i
will
not
go
near
him
and
when
john
mure
strove
to
persuade
him
to
it
he
struck
at
him
fiercely
with
his
open
hand
leaving
the
stead
of
his
fingers
dead
white
upon
his
father
s
cheek
and
when
they
took
his
arm
and
would
have
forced
him
to
it
he
threw
himself
down
headlong
in
the
sand
foaming
and
crying
i
will
not
touch
for
blood
i
will
not
touch
for
blood
but
in
spite
of
his
struggling
they
carried
him
to
where
the
body
lay
and
all
men
standing
back
they
thrust
his
bare
hand
sharply
upon
the
neck
where
the
rope
had
been
and
it
is
true
as
scripture
i
that
write
declare
though
i
can
not
explain
it
out
from
the
open
mouth
of
the
lad
there
sprang
a
gout
of
black
and
oozy
blood
whereat
a
great
cry
went
up
and
james
mure
fell
forward
oh
the
sand
as
one
suddenly
stricken
dead
all
crowded
forward
to
see
crying
with
one
voice
the
judgment
of
god
the
judgment
of
god
and
i
shouted
too
for
i
had
seen
the
vindication
of
justice
upon
the
murderer
the
blood
of
abel
had
cried
out
of
the
waste
sea
sand
the
mark
of
god
was
on
the
guilty
then
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
the
push
i
heard
a
stirring
and
a
shouting
stop
him
stop
him
they
cried
i
looked
about
and
lo
there
sitting
erect
upon
his
horse
and
riding
like
fire
among
heather
was
john
mure
he
had
stolen
away
while
all
eyes
were
on
the
marvel
he
had
passed
unregarded
through
the
press
and
now
he
rode
for
his
life
southward
along
the
shore
i
gave
one
mighty
twist
to
the
manacles
on
my
wrists
and
whether
those
that
set
them
had
been
kindly
being
of
my
own
name
and
clan
or
whether
the
gyves
were
weak
i
can
not
tell
at
all
events
my
hands
were
free
and
so
with
never
a
weapon
in
my
possession
i
leaped
on
a
same
indeed
which
the
king
had
been
set
it
to
the
gallop
after
the
man
whose
death
was
my
life
it
was
the
maddest
foolishest
venture
for
doubtless
my
enemy
was
well
armed
but
i
seemed
to
see
my
love
and
all
the
endowment
of
grace
and
favour
i
was
to
receive
with
her
vanishing
away
with
every
stride
of
john
mure
s
horse
besides
there
was
a
king
and
an
earl
looking
on
so
upon
the
king
s
horse
i
settled
down
to
a
long
chase
i
was
already
far
forward
ere
behind
me
i
heard
the
clatter
of
mounting
men
the
crying
to
restive
horses
to
stand
still
and
the
other
accompaniments
of
a
cavalcade
leaping
hastily
into
the
saddle
but
when
i
looked
at
john
mure
upon
his
fleet
steed
and
saw
that
i
upon
the
king
s
horse
but
scarcely
held
mine
own
i
knew
that
the
stopping
of
the
murderer
must
be
work
of
mine
if
it
were
to
be
done
at
all
so
i
resolved
to
chance
it
in
spite
of
whatever
armoury
of
weapons
he
might
carry
but
first
i
cleared
my
feet
of
the
great
stirrups
which
the
king
used
so
that
if
it
came
to
the
bitter
pinch
and
i
was
stricken
with
a
bullet
or
pierced
with
steel
i
should
not
be
dragged
helpless
along
the
ground
with
my
foot
in
the
iron
as
once
or
twice
i
had
seen
happen
in
battle
and
that
though
an
easily
memorable
is
i
can
bear
witness
not
a
bonny
sight
my
charger
stretched
away
as
though
he
had
been
a
beagle
running
conies
of
the
down
into
their
holes
but
john
mure
s
horse
went
every
whit
as
fast
i
saw
well
that
he
made
for
the
deep
trackless
spaces
of
killochan
wood
the
oak
trees
that
grew
along
its
edge
stretched
out
their
arms
to
hide
him
the
birken
shaw
waved
all
its
green
boughs
with
a
promise
of
security
i
shortened
my
grip
upon
the
stout
staff
which
the
king
carried
at
the
pommel
of
his
saddle
yet
as
john
mure
drave
madly
towards
the
wood
and
sometimes
looked
over
his
shoulder
to
see
how
i
came
on
i
was
overjoyed
to
notice
a
wide
ditch
before
him
which
he
must
needs
at
that
business
if
at
no
other
i
thought
to
beat
him
being
slim
and
of
half
his
weight
so
i
kept
my
horse
to
the
right
upon
better
ground
though
it
took
me
a
little
out
of
the
straight
course
for
the
wood
his
horse
at
the
first
refused
the
leap
and
i
counted
upon
him
as
mine
but
i
counted
too
soon
for
he
went
down
the
bankside
a
short
way
to
an
easier
place
where
there
was
a
landward
man
s
bridge
of
trees
and
sods
here
he
easily
walked
his
horse
across
and
having
mounted
the
bank
he
waved
his
hand
at
me
and
set
off
again
toward
the
wood
but
now
while
he
had
an
uneven
country
to
overpass
i
had
only
the
green
fields
rich
in
old
pasture
and
undulating
like
the
waves
of
an
oily
tide
when
the
sea
is
deep
and
there
is
no
break
of
the
water
he
was
at
the
very
edge
of
the
wood
before
i
came
upon
his
flank
then
i
gave
a
loud
shout
as
i
set
my
horse
to
his
speed
and
circled
about
to
head
him
off
but
john
mure
though
an
old
man
only
settled
himself
firmer
in
his
saddle
and
with
his
sword
in
his
hand
rode
soldierly
and
straight
at
the
wood
as
though
i
had
not
been
in
front
of
him
at
all
it
was
wisely
enough
done
for
his
heavier
beast
took
mine
upon
the
shoulder
and
almost
rolled
me
in
the
dust
he
came
upon
me
not
front
to
front
as
a
rider
meets
his
foe
in
the
lists
but
as
it
were
stem
to
side
like
two
boats
that
meet
upon
converging
tacks
yet
i
managed
to
avoid
him
being
light
and
supple
though
he
leaned
far
over
and
struck
savagely
at
me
as
he
passed
again
at
the
third
shock
he
had
almost
overridden
me
and
made
me
die
the
death
but
i
had
not
practised
horsemanship
and
the
art
of
fighting
in
the
saddle
so
long
for
nothing
indeed
on
all
the
seaboard
of
ayr
there
was
no
one
that
could
compare
with
me
in
these
things
therefore
it
was
easy
for
me
by
dint
of
my
quickness
and
skill
to
swerve
off
to
the
right
and
receive
the
sword
stroke
in
my
cloak
which
i
carried
twisted
about
my
left
arm
then
keeping
still
between
the
wood
and
john
mure
i
met
him
this
time
face
to
face
with
my
eyes
watching
the
direction
of
his
eye
and
the
crook
of
his
elbow
that
i
might
know
where
he
meant
to
strike
for
a
good
sworder
knows
the
enemy
s
intent
and
his
blade
meets
it
long
ere
thought
can
pass
into
action
so
it
was
no
which
told
me
that
he
meant
to
slash
me
across
the
thigh
when
he
came
me
i
knew
it
or
ever
his
blade
was
raised
so
that
when
he
struck
i
was
ready
for
him
and
measured
his
sword
proving
my
distance
as
it
had
been
upon
parade
and
as
the
blade
whistled
by
me
i
judged
that
it
was
my
turn
and
struck
him
with
all
the
force
i
could
muster
a
crashing
blow
upon
the
face
with
the
heavy
butt
of
the
king
s
stave
which
stunned
and
unsettled
him
so
that
he
pitched
forward
upon
his
horse
yet
not
so
as
to
lose
his
seat
nevertheless
owing
to
the
swing
of
my
arm
the
stroke
fell
also
partly
upon
his
horse
s
back
which
affrighted
the
beast
and
set
him
harder
than
ever
to
the
running
so
that
i
was
passed
ere
i
knew
it
and
the
wood
was
won
but
i
was
not
thirty
yards
behind
him
and
looked
to
make
the
capture
ere
we
reached
the
further
side
and
but
for
a
foul
trick
i
should
have
done
it
it
so
happens
that
there
is
a
little
hill
in
the
woods
of
killochan
and
i
seeing
that
john
mure
was
riding
about
one
side
took
round
the
other
thinking
that
i
had
the
shorter
line
of
it
but
he
so
soon
as
he
saw
me
make
round
the
corner
turned
his
horse
into
its
own
and
sped
away
back
it
had
been
to
meet
them
that
pursued
but
at
the
same
time
bearing
enough
to
the
south
to
clear
them
easily
so
that
when
i
came
round
the
hill
i
saw
no
quarry
and
only
heard
the
boughs
crashing
in
his
wake
nevertheless
without
the
loss
of
a
moment
i
took
the
line
of
his
retreat
as
i
thought
yet
not
so
correctly
but
that
when
i
issued
forth
from
the
wood
i
saw
him
nigh
half
a
mile
in
front
again
he
waved
a
contumelious
hand
which
made
me
so
fiercely
angry
that
i
tightened
my
and
vowed
to
go
no
more
to
sunny
culzean
if
i
took
not
back
the
head
and
hands
of
john
mure
at
my
saddlebow
so
with
set
and
determined
brow
i
rode
ever
forward
it
was
the
cast
of
the
die
for
me
for
nell
herself
our
life
together
and
our
green
pastures
and
napery
cupboards
were
all
to
come
out
of
the
catching
of
this
enemy
of
our
house
it
is
small
wonder
therefore
that
i
was
passing
keen
upon
the
matter
yet
in
spite
of
my
endeavours
i
gained
but
little
and
it
was
already
greying
to
the
twilight
when
i
came
to
a
place
by
the
seashore
waste
and
solitary
where
there
were
but
few
houses
about
i
had
seen
john
mure
ride
in
thitherwards
and
so
i
followed
him
full
tilt
reckless
of
danger
being
with
the
of
my
riding
and
quest
but
as
i
entered
the
narrows
of
the
pass
a
stone
flew
from
an
ambuscade
i
felt
a
hot
stunning
blow
upon
the
head
and
with
the
pain
i
remember
laying
hold
of
my
horse
s
mane
and
gripping
tight
with
the
hand
on
which
a
broken
manacle
still
jangled
something
warm
flowed
over
my
brow
and
suddenly
i
saw
everything
red
as
though
i
had
been
looking
through
the
stained
glass
of
some
ancient
flowers
red
grass
red
sand
and
red
sea
that
was
all
i
saw
and
i
do
not
remember
even
falling
to
the
ground
place
of
the
legion
of
when
i
woke
it
was
exceedingly
dark
but
a
darkness
with
shooting
lights
and
hideous
sounds
at
the
first
start
i
thought
that
i
was
dead
and
in
the
place
of
torment
and
when
i
grew
a
little
more
awake
i
wished
to
god
that
i
had
been
for
all
about
were
swart
naked
men
and
women
dancing
round
me
while
on
a
cask
or
keg
at
my
head
sat
john
mure
himself
wrapped
in
his
cloak
and
regarding
me
with
gloating
baleful
bloodshot
eyes
then
i
knew
that
i
was
lost
indeed
for
by
the
flickering
light
of
a
dying
fire
of
driftwood
i
could
see
that
i
was
again
in
the
cave
of
sawny
bean
in
the
same
wide
hall
with
the
strange
narrow
hams
on
the
roof
the
tubs
of
salt
meat
festering
under
the
eaves
and
the
wild
savage
crew
dancing
about
me
what
wonder
that
my
heart
fainted
within
me
to
be
thus
left
alone
in
that
den
of
hideous
things
and
especially
to
think
of
the
free
birds
going
to
their
beds
on
the
cliffs
above
me
and
the
fishing
solan
geese
circling
and
balancing
home
to
the
lonely
rock
of
ailsa
ha
sir
launcelot
kennedy
said
a
mocking
voice
as
the
deafening
turmoil
quieted
a
little
you
are
near
your
honours
is
if
there
be
such
bauble
dignities
either
in
heaven
or
hell
the
treasure
of
kelwood
in
hand
john
mure
s
life
out
of
there
on
the
shelf
as
it
were
are
your
broad
acres
and
your
bonny
lady
i
was
silent
for
i
knew
that
nothing
could
avail
me
now
it
was
useless
to
waste
words
but
ere
all
that
comes
to
pass
he
went
on
there
are
sundry
little
formalities
to
be
gone
we
are
right
dainty
folk
here
in
sawny
bean
s
mansion
you
shall
be
kept
warm
and
cherished
tenderly
there
are
here
twenty
sonsier
queans
than
the
one

warmly
shall
they
welcome
sweetly
shall
they
cherish
handsome
sir
launcelot
their
embracements
shall
sting
you
more
than
all
sweethearting
again
he
pauses
to
observe
the
effect
of
his
words
you
that
so
lately
held
me
in
chase
like
a
steer
that
has
escaped
from
the
shambles
now
you
yourself
are
in
the
thills
you
that
have
crossed
me
a
thousand
times
in
my
plans
since
that
frore
night
in
sir
thomas
nesbitt
s
yard
in
maybole
you
shall
now
be
crossed
in
a
new
fashion
you
that
wagged
tongue
so
merrily
at
another
s
expense
you
shall
see
your
tongue
wag
upon
the
redhot
brander
to
an
unkenned
tune
you
that
have
ridden
so
fast
and
so
far
you
shall
ride
your
last
slowly
very
slowly
cried
the
fiend
in
my
ear
for
i
shall
hoard
every
drop
of
your
blood
as
john
of
cassillis
hoards
his
gold
rose
nobles
i
shall
husband
every
minute
of
your
life
as
though
they
were
the
hours
of
young
bridal
content
ye
have
bruised
my
old
face
indeed
with
your
oaken
staff
but
i
will
cherish
yours
that
is
youthful
and
blooming
tenderly
shall
we
take
off
the
coverture
of
hide
the
tegument
of
beauty
sawny
bean
has
famous
skill
in
such
surgery
gently
will
we
lay
you
down
in
the
swarming
nest
of
the
patient
ant
we
have
read
how
scripture
bids
the
sluggard
go
to
the
ant
for
if
that
makes
him
not
lively
nothing
will
i
have
ofttimes
commented
on
the
passage
at
family
worship
and
i
must
see
that
the
young
and
headstrong
like
you
my
lord
launcelot
give
heed
to
that
which
is
but
in
spite
of
all
his
terrible
threatenings
i
bode
still
and
answered
him
never
a
word
they
laid
logs
of
driftwood
upon
the
fire
till
the
whole
inside
of
the
cave
grew
bright
and
clear
and
all
the
monstrous
deformity
of
the
women
and
the
cruel
hideousness
of
the
men
were
made
apparent
as
in
broad
daylight
some
of
them
were
painted
and
stained
like
demons
and
danced
and
leaped
through
the
fire
like
them
too
for
such
monsters
have
not
been
heard
of
much
less
seen
in
the
history
of
any
country
as
were
sawny
bean
and
his
crew
in
the
cave
upon
the
seashore
of
bennanbrack
bring
me
a
knife
cried
john
mure
from
where
he
sat
for
he
appeared
like
a
chief
devil
among
a
company
of
gibbering
lubber
fiends
he
had
still
his
grey
cloak
about
him
his
plumed
hat
was
upon
his
head
and
he
looked
save
for
the
eyes
of
him
in
which
the
fires
of
hell
burned
a
civil
respectable
man
of
means
and
substance
as
indeed
save
for
his
evil
heart
he
might
have
been
for
he
came
of
as
good
a
family
as
the
earl
of
cassillis
or
as
it
might
be
as
i
myself
launcelot
kennedy
of
kirrieoch
so
when
auchendrayne
asked
for
a
knife
sawny
bean
himself
the
ruffian
kemper
and
inhuman
brought
it
to
him
with
a
grin
he
made
as
if
he
would
have
set
it
in
me
to
the
hilt
but
john
mure
stayed
him
bide
he
said
not
so
fast
there
is
long
and
sweet
pleasuring
to
come
before
slow
relishing
delight
such
covetous
mouseplay
of
the
brindled
cat
such
luxurious
of
the
delicate
skin
till
it
be
raw
such
dainty
torments
as
when
one
would
bite
his
love
and
be
glad
of
it
he
shall
taste
them
all
this
frolic
squire
of
this
gamesome
player
upon
pipes
this
curious
handler
of
quaint
love
tunes
ere
we
pluck
the
red
rose
of
his
life
he
shall
sate
himself
with
new
delicious
than
the
handling
of
many
maidens
i
was
moved
to
speak
to
him
i
ask
not
mercy
said
i
for
i
own
that
i
would
have
killed
you
if
i
could
but
as
you
are
a
valiant
man
give
me
a
sword
and
let
me
make
a
stand
for
it
against
you
all
that
as
i
have
lived
so
i
may
also
die
but
he
mocked
me
hurrying
on
in
his
heady
turmoil
of
words
if
i
be
a
man
you
said
that
i
was
a
man
do
i
act
as
other
men
is
my
knowledge
like
that
of
other
men
do
i
company
with
other
men
call
you
that
a
man
he
pointed
to
sawny
bean
who
for
wantonness
sat
on
an
upturned
tub
striking
with
a
knife
at
the
legs
of
all
that
came
by
for
mere
delight
of
blood
storming
at
them
meantime
with
horrid
imprecations
to
approach
nearer
and
be
flicked
or
call
you
these
men
he
showed
me
some
of
the
younger
cannibal
race
gnawing
like
kennelled
dogs
at
horrid
bones
nay
my
dainty
wanton
you
shall
not
enter
hell
through
the
brave
brattle
of
warring
blades
nor
yet
handling
your
rapier
like
a
but
as
the
blood
drains
to
the
white
from
the
stricken
calf
so
shall
they
whiten
your
flesh
for
the
tooth
and
so
reluctantly
shall
your
life
drip
from
you
drop
by
and
i
declare
that
this
scornful
fiend
telling
me
of
tortures
in
choice
words
made
me
scunner
more
than
the
prick
of
the
knife
for
the
abhorred
invention
quickened
the
imagination
and
set
the
nerves
agate
so
that
i
was
honestly
glad
when
he
took
knife
in
shoemaker
s
curved
blade
with
a
keen
cutting
edge
strip
him
naked
he
cried
and
very
cheerfully
so
they
did
smiting
me
the
meantime
with
the
broad
of
their
hand
then
john
mure
leaned
over
me
delicately
and
made
as
though
he
would
have
traced
with
his
knife
the
jointing
of
my
limbs
saying
thus
and
thus
shall
the
dismember
your
body
when
the
torture
of
the
ant
s
nest
is
and
again
here
is
toothsome
eating
sawny
bean
thou
chief
lover
of
dainty
then
as
the
evil
man
went
on
with
his
pitiless
jestings
his
grey
cloak
began
to
waver
before
me
his
face
to
glow
like
fire
and
i
fainted
or
dwamed
away
till
the
sharp
knife
pricked
me
into
consciousness
again
yet
auchendrayne
overdid
his
threatening
for
the
too
sharp
relish
of
the
words
issued
in
tranced
dulness
ere
the
matter
came
to
action
and
of
torture
there
was
none
that
i
can
now
remember
or
bear
the
mark
only
the
slight
scores
of
the
knife
which
he
made
when
he
showed
me
where
they
would
joint
and
haggle
my
body
indeed
i
mind
no
more
till
i
came
to
myself
lying
on
my
back
with
the
cave
all
empty
save
for
john
sat
as
before
with
his
hand
to
his
ear
listening
but
there
sounded
a
great
and
furious
uproar
down
by
the
cave
mouth
the
deep
baying
of
bloodhounds
the
fierce
cry
of
many
voices
striving
for
mastery
and
above
all
the
shrieks
of
the
smitten
surely
i
thought
there
is
a
battle
fierce
and
fell
at
the
cave
s
mouth
john
mure
sat
and
listened
for
a
long
space
and
presently
he
looked
over
at
me
i
will
even
make
sure
of
him
come
what
may
he
said
and
with
that
he
took
the
knife
and
came
nearer
to
smite
me
in
the
breast
and
i
lay
as
one
dead
already
waiting
for
the
stroke
but
even
in
that
moment
as
i
held
my
breath
a
ravening
hound
darted
within
the
cave
overleaped
the
embers
of
the
fire
and
pinned
the
murderer
to
the
earth
by
the
throat
he
struck
out
desperately
but
the
dog
held
him
fast
another
and
another
came
in
till
as
it
seemed
he
was
in
danger
of
being
torn
to
pieces
of
dogs
but
me
they
minded
not
at
all
for
as
i
say
i
lay
as
one
dead
and
this
is
the
story
of
the
chase
as
nell
told
it
to
me
when
all
was
over
as
they
of
the
king
s
company
looked
from
the
shore
towards
the
south
there
in
the
distance
was
john
mure
on
his
horse
disappearing
into
the
wood
and
i
as
it
seemed
at
his
very
heels
both
of
us
were
leaning
far
forward
like
men
that
run
a
race
and
because
she
knew
that
i
carried
no
equipment
with
me
nell
leaped
upon
a
horse
with
a
sword
laid
before
her
crosswise
on
the
saddle
whereupon
i
turned
to
nell
and
called
her
the
bravest
maid
in
broad
scotland
with
other
names
as
i
could
mind
them
but
she
set
her
head
aside
and
would
content
me
nothing
though
i
was
minded
for
kindness
saying
only
if
you
do
not
desire
to
hear
the
tale
then
i
am
saved
the
fash
of
telling
it
tis
no
time
for
fooling
said
she
when
i
am
speaking
of
the
saving
of
your
nell
said
i
for
i
was
nettled
at
her
indifference
thou
art
an
unseasoned
lass
skilless
in
love
s
i
want
none
of
kate
allison
s
at
second
hand
said
nell
harking
back
like
a
pretty
shrew
on
her
former
taunts
since
ye
are
so
wise
unriddle
me
the
manner
of
your
saving
from
the
cave
of
sawny
bean
and
i
am
content
to
yield
me
to
your
teaching
in
the
yet
even
with
this
fair
promise
i
could
not
but
desired
her
instead
to
continue
her
well
said
she
robert
harburgh
it
was
who
next
after
me
took
not
far
behind
either
for
he
had
but
to
disentangle
the
bridle
from
his
arm
while
i
had
to
beguile
another
to
lend
me
his
horse
so
in
a
little
we
were
all
after
you
and
we
took
the
wood
in
the
very
place
you
entered
but
naught
could
we
find
save
the
trail
of
you
all
confused
among
the
trees
then
what
a
chasing
hither
and
thither
there
followed
even
the
king
searched
for
you
like
any
common
man
and
puffed
and
blew
upon
his
purple
cheeks
like
the
dominie
on
his
pipes
and
he
that
had
been
our
companion
this
same
dominie
went
about
everywhere
seeking
and
crying
each
time
that
he
came
near
to
me
reckless
loon
reckless
loon
well
he
deserves
to
be
unbreeched
and
soundly
paid
for
this
hardiness
then
we
utterly
lost
you
and
i
believe
they
would
have
given
up
the
search
but
i
minded
me
of
the
dogs
that
james
of
chapeldonnan
keeps
for
his
own
purposes
which
on
my
way
to
ailsa
i
had
seen
his
wife
feed
so
i
told
the
earl
john
of
them
and
he
had
james
bannatyne
brought
and
bade
him
bring
them
to
set
on
the
trail
promising
him
his
life
if
the
matter
were
brought
to
a
good
issue
and
so
robert
harburgh
and
a
few
swords
were
sent
to
chapeldonnan
with
james
his
life
upon
it
if
he
played
them
false
and
robert
harburgh
s
sword
near
his
ribs
each
time
that
he
faltered
or
failed
to
remember
and
the
good
wife
seeing
her
man
in
such
deadly
case
came
back
herself
to
plead
with
the
king
for
him
so
the
chapeldonnan
pack
was
laid
on
the
trail
and
fine
bloodhounds
they
were
but
so
soon
as
i
heard
the
first
deep
bay
when
with
noses
on
the
ground
they
took
the
line
of
the
shore
it
went
to
my
heart
that
since
you
were
the
last
to
enter
the
wood
the
dogs
would
first
seize
you
so
i
cried
a
word
to
robert
harburgh
and
we
two
that
loved
you
spurred
horses
and
sped
on
level
with
the
dogs
and
through
all
the
windings
and
wimplings
of
your
path
we
followed
till
we
came
to
the
shore
where
together
with
the
king
s
oaken
staff
which
had
been
in
your
hand
we
found
the
place
all
trampled
with
naked
feet
and
stains
of
blood
so
we
traced
you
across
the
shore
grass
to
the
sand
and
over
the
sand
into
the
sea
with
a
company
of
bare
feet
and
many
stains
of
blood
then
for
a
moment
i
knew
not
what
to
think
but
marjorie
my
sister
cried
out
it
is
the
vile
wretches
of
sawny
bean
s
band
who
have
taken
him
to
the
cave
of
death
then
i
remembered
that
the
entrance
to
the
cavern
was
among
the
rocks
and
yet
because
of
the
gladness
that
was
in
our
hearts
when
we
issued
forth
i
had
taken
no
very
great
pains
to
mind
the
exact
place
nor
was
the
dominie
aught
the
wiser
for
he
had
been
wholly
intent
on
blowing
upon
his
pipes
but
marjorie
minded
better
than
any
of
us
the
cleave
in
the
rocks
and
showed
us
to
a
nearness
where
the
cave
entrance
was
but
the
tide
had
flowed
in
and
we
had
perforce
to
wait
and
calm
our
impatience
as
best
we
might
till
it
went
back
again
ere
we
could
follow
into
the
cave
mouth
but
by
this
time
it
was
dark
so
that
the
had
to
find
rosin
torches
and
set
them
alight
thus
with
the
flambeaux
blazing
and
the
smoke
wavering
red
overhead
we
took
our
way
along
the
wet
edge
of
the
sea
but
the
tide
had
washed
away
all
traces
of
blood
and
feet
up
and
down
the
coast
we
wandered
trying
every
covert
and
yet
for
our
lives
we
could
not
hit
upon
the
right
cave
s
entrance
the
dogs
ran
yelping
and
nosing
here
and
there
but
for
long
nothing
came
of
it
then
earl
john
and
the
king
himself
threatened
james
bannatyne
to
reveal
the
place
but
he
denied
that
he
had
any
knowledge
of
the
cave
and
whether
he
spoke
truth
or
no
i
can
not
say
but
his
wife
went
to
the
king
and
holding
his
bridle
rein
she
said
well
do
i
ken
your
majesty
that
my
man
s
life
is
forfeit
but
he
is
my
husband
and
at
least
so
far
as
it
concerns
him
and
me
betwixt
and
i
can
rule
him
as
a
wife
should
gin
i
persuade
him
to
lead
you
to
the
spot
will
ye
on
your
word
give
me
my
ain
man
s
life
so
the
king
promised
though
earl
john
hung
a
little
on
the
form
of
the
words
then
went
the
goodwife
of
chapeldonnan
to
her
husband
and
what
she
said
to
him
i
know
not
for
they
spake
privily
and
apart
but
though
at
first
he
shook
his
head
and
denied
as
i
could
see
that
he
had
any
knowledge
of
the
cave
of
death
yet
in
a
little
while
he
took
some
other
thought
and
ran
forward
to
grip
one
of
the
dogs
then
went
james
bannatyne
on
ahead
with
all
of
us
hotfoot
after
him
with
the
torches
and
the
and
you
also
nell
said
i
were
you
lurking
with
the
and
which
had
you
a
sword
or
a
torch
i
had
both
said
nell
kennedy
shortly
and
went
on
with
her
tale
as
if
she
had
been
speaking
of
james
bannatyne
took
the
dog
into
all
the
wide
cave
mouths
and
made
him
smell
the
walls
and
floor
above
the
tide
mark
talking
to
the
brute
all
the
time
and
encouraging
him
but
for
a
long
time
it
was
still
in
vain
at
last
the
other
dog
which
had
been
left
to
itself
bayed
out
suddenly
from
among
the
rocks
where
it
had
found
a
dark
and
dismal
archway
with
a
wide
pool
of
water
in
it
which
we
had
passed
time
and
again
without
suspicion
and
at
the
entrance
to
this
place
we
found
the
second
hound
with
tail
erected
baying
up
the
cave
mouth
from
the
edge
of
the
pool
then
so
soon
as
james
bannatyne
brought
in
his
dog
it
began
to
smell
hither
and
thither
with
erected
ears
and
bristling
hair
presently
it
swam
away
into
the
darkness
and
because
the
men
hesitated
to
go
after
the
beast
i
took
the
water
to
show
them
the
hearing
which
i
had
made
my
acknowledgments
but
nell
said
no
no
hear
my
tale
then
with
me
there
came
robert
harburgh
and
after
him
the
earl
and
all
his
company
with
their
torches
the
pool
proved
shallow
and
after
many
turns
and
windings
we
came
to
a
wide
to
the
same
beach
with
sand
and
dripping
fingers
of
stone
where
we
had
first
found
ourselves
and
here
also
we
passed
the
remains
of
our
boat
for
it
was
to
this
point
that
we
had
rowed
that
night
when
we
took
refuge
in
the
lion
s
den
the
savages
had
broken
most
of
it
up
for
firewood
yet
enough
remained
so
that
i
knew
it
again
but
ere
the
had
time
to
gather
behind
us
a
host
of
wild
creatures
armed
with
stones
knives
and
burst
upon
us
yelling
like
demons
of
the
pit
women
also
there
were
some
half
clad
and
some
wholly
without
cleading
and
then
and
there
was
a
fight
such
as
you
launce
love
to
tell
about
but
i
have
no
skill
in
for
the
shot
and
we
that
had
but
swords
struck
while
the
wild
folk
shouted
and
the
savage
women
bit
and
tore
with
their
nails
till
the
cavern
was
full
of
confused
noise
and
the
red
reek
of
burning
torches
but
ever
as
the
slain
rolled
among
our
feet
they
gripped
to
pull
us
down
so
that
in
the
intervals
of
his
fighting
robert
harburgh
went
hither
and
thither
making
siccar
as
he
said
with
a
coup
de
grace
for
each
poor
clawing
wretch
and
in
the
narrow
doorway
through
which
you
found
the
way
stood
the
chief
himself
with
his
eyes
and
his
hair
about
his
face
he
gripped
a
mighty
axe
in
his
hand
and
with
it
he
stood
ready
to
cleave
all
that
came
against
him
even
the
men
hesitated
at
his
fearsome
aspect
and
it
was
small
wonder
but
i
knew
that
there
was
no
other
way
to
the
innermost
cave
so
i
cried
to
them
to
overpass
the
rabble
and
drive
forward
at
all
hazards
how
it
came
about
i
know
not
but
a
moment
after
i
found
myself
opposite
to
sawny
bean
himself
and
engaging
him
with
your
for
all
the
world
as
if
it
had
been
in
the
armoire
room
of
culzean
on
a
rainy
day
and
you
again
teaching
me
the
fence
of
blade
against
lochaber
axe
but
though
i
had
not
wholly
forgotten
my
skill
doubtless
the
giant
had
soon
made
an
end
of
me
for
he
struck
fiercely
every
way
but
sudden
as
the
heathcat
springs
on
the
hill
the
little
dominie
leaped
upon
him
and
drove
his
sword
into
his
heart
so
that
sawny
bean
fell
with
dominie
mure
upon
his
breast
then
because
he
was
not
able
to
pull
out
his
sword
again
being
too
close
the
dominie
gripped
his
dagger
and
struck
again
and
again
panting
and
between
each
blow
he
cried
out
the
name
of
a
mary
torrance
mary
torrance
he
said
then
it
was
that
the
hounds
the
two
of
them
struggling
there
in
the
arch
and
sprang
on
and
after
them
came
robert
harburgh
and
i
we
two
first
entered
the
murky
place
of
death
the
dogs
were
mouthing
and
gripping
the
grey
man
but
you
lay
naked
upon
the
sand
as
it
had
been
this
was
the
matter
of
nell
s
tale
and
i
will
now
in
turn
take
up
mine
own
part
in
it
from
the
time
at
which
the
dogs
gripped
my
remorseless
enemy
and
as
it
had
been
the
life
went
out
from
me
finding
of
the
treasure
of
when
i
came
to
myself
the
cave
was
filled
with
armed
men
and
the
confused
clamour
of
voices
the
torches
spluttered
and
reeked
and
i
could
feel
that
my
naked
body
was
covered
with
a
woman
s
cloak
wrapped
well
about
me
someone
was
binding
up
my
head
and
as
she
examined
to
see
if
all
had
been
rightly
done
i
saw
that
it
was
nell
kennedy
so
i
called
her
softly
by
her
name
but
she
bade
me
not
try
to
rise
and
looked
again
to
my
head
to
see
that
it
had
no
serious
wound
then
came
john
the
earl
and
asked
how
i
did
whereupon
minding
as
is
my
wont
to
have
old
time
by
the
forelock
i
spoke
of
his
promise
here
i
said
is
the
murderer
john
mure
here
is
the
gang
of
monsters
and
now
i
will
put
you
in
the
way
of
obtaining
the
treasure
of
kelwood
if
you
will
fulfil
the
promise
which
you
made
to
what
was
that
he
said
shortly
for
though
earl
john
liked
promising
well
enough
he
was
not
so
fond
of
performing
if
it
cost
him
aught
as
in
this
case
it
was
like
to
do
my
sweetheart
here
my
knighthood
and
a
suitable
of
land
said
i
knowing
that
it
was
now
or
never
with
me
then
he
demurred
a
little
and
hesitated
so
that
for
a
moment
i
thought
all
was
lost
your
sweetheart
you
shall
have
he
said
at
last
but
the
others
are
not
in
my
a
holding
of
land
perhaps
which
i
can
let
you
for
a
trifling
return
when
it
falls
and
so
rejoiced
was
i
to
think
of
getting
my
lass
that
i
might
have
consented
to
this
but
nell
was
behind
me
and
upon
pretence
of
arranging
a
knot
of
the
bandage
upon
my
forehead
she
whispered
in
my
ear
threat
him
with
telling
the
king
about
the
so
knowing
her
wisdom
i
obeyed
her
well
then
earl
john
said
i
if
that
be
so
and
a
knighthood
and
suitable
heritages
are
not
in
your
power
to
bestow
here
at
hand
is
the
king
give
me
leave
to
speak
with
him
he
is
fond
of
treasure
and
i
can
put
a
brave
one
under
his
hand
hush
said
the
earl
looking
about
him
with
apprehension
for
the
king
was
yet
in
the
place
with
mar
and
lennox
ordering
the
taking
down
and
burying
of
the
strange
white
hams
and
the
other
things
that
turned
the
gay
squeamish
folk
that
came
with
him
pale
and
sick
only
to
look
upon
them
hush
he
said
again
above
all
things
beware
what
you
say
to
the
king
show
the
kelwood
treasure
to
myself
alone
and
you
shall
have
and
all
minnochside
from
the
to
the
forks
of
trool
and
i
will
even
speak
to
the
king
about
the
knighting
will
your
lordship
please
to
declare
it
before
witnesses
said
i
nell
prompting
me
as
before
for
my
head
was
dazed
but
hers
was
singularly
clear
so
he
called
to
him
certain
honourable
men
of
his
name
and
promised
faithfully
are
you
content
said
he
so
i
said
nelly
show
them
the
treasure
here
is
the
key
and
she
rose
and
took
them
to
the
by
the
blessing
of
god
remained
still
where
we
had
left
it
in
the
she
fitted
the
key
in
the
lock
and
it
turned
without
a
sound
and
there
the
earl
bathed
his
hands
in
the
set
jewels
the
loose
stones
of
price
and
the
coined
golden
money
plashing
them
through
his
fingers
with
a
sound
like
a
spout
of
water
till
for
fear
of
the
king
i
advised
him
to
close
it
again
it
is
worth
the
bargain
said
he
though
i
am
sorry
to
have
promised
away
fair
minnochside
i
trow
it
was
woman
s
wit
that
guided
you
in
the
asking
and
not
that
of
thine
launcelot
but
i
answered
not
knowing
how
to
leave
well
alone
when
a
man
is
pleased
with
himself
so
the
earl
placed
robert
harburgh
to
guard
the
chest
and
to
lie
discreetly
concerning
it
if
any
of
the
king
s
men
should
come
near
saying
that
it
was
but
some
foulness
appropriate
to
the
den
but
none
came
asking
and
thus
was
the
treasure
of
kelwood
conquest
for
ever
to
the
family
of
cassillis
as
for
sawny
bean
s
monstrous
brood
is
it
not
recorded
how
they
were
carried
through
the
country
to
edinburgh
and
as
how
they
went
the
folk
flocked
in
from
leagues
away
to
see
and
execrate
them
they
were
hurried
straight
to
the
sands
of
leith
where
without
process
of
trial
or
pleading
and
in
the
manner
prescribed
for
such
fiends
they
were
executed
out
of
hand
as
enemies
to
the
human
race
in
general
thus
mainly
through
my
instrumentality
was
the
country
rid
of
a
monstrous
foul
blot
such
as
no
land
since
the
flood
has
ever
been
cursed
with
though
i
deny
not
that
dominie
mure
and
nell
kennedy
helped
well
according
to
their
possibles
yet
the
most
part
of
the
credit
was
rightly
given
to
me
who
had
twice
adventured
my
life
within
the
cave
of
as
i
admit
on
both
occasions
against
my
will
once
more
the
city
of
edinburgh
swarmed
with
kennedys
come
thither
to
the
great
trial
there
had
not
been
so
great
a
concurrence
of
westland
folk
in
edinburgh
since
the
memorable
day
when
young
gilbert
of
bargany
cleared
the
causeway
of
us
of
the
house
of
which
afterwards
we
were
one
and
all
put
to
the
horn
to
our
great
and
lasting
honour
as
hath
been
related
at
the
west
port
i
met
patrick
rippett
he
who
had
taunted
benane
at
the
maybole
snowballing
whither
is
your
eye
gone
i
asked
him
for
he
had
a
black
patch
where
his
left
eye
should
have
been
a
fause
loon
pyked
it
out
and
offered
it
me
back
on
the
end
of
his
rapier
said
patrick
rippett
with
the
utmost
unconcern
and
what
said
ye
to
him
i
asked
of
patrick
because
he
was
not
a
man
to
take
a
jest
and
such
a
jest
for
nothing
faith
i
juist
bartered
him
fair
i
offered
him
his
heart
on
the
point
of
mine
said
rippett
and
so
strolled
away
ogling
the
snooded
maids
at
the
windows
of
the
high
lands
as
best
he
could
with
the
one
wicked
orb
which
was
left
to
him
i
was
walking
with
my
father
at
the
time
he
had
ridden
the
long
way
from
kirrieoch
on
a
white
pony
all
to
pleasure
my
mother
ye
maun
gang
and
hear
the
laddie
gie
his
evidence
she
bade
him
they
will
fright
him
to
deid

amang
thae
edinburgh
men
o
the
law
they
are
no
canny
so
long
as
launce
gets
striking
at
them
with
the
steel

ken
he
is
safe
and
sound
for
his
hand

e
en
keep
his
head
as
a
kennedy
s
ever

but
wha
kens
what
they
may
do
to
my
laddie
when
he
stands
afore
the
justicers
and
the
lawyer
loons
come
at
him
wi
their
quips
and
quandaries
faith
then
good
wife
said
my
father
ye
shall
come
too
and
thou
and
i
shall
ride
to
edinburgh
like
joes
that
are
newly
and
though
at
first
she
denied
yet
at
the
last
she
consented
a
desire
to
purchase
garmentry
more
suitable
for
the
wife
of
a
laird
and
the
mother
of
one
who
was
to
be
made
a
knight
when
my
mother
went
out
for
the
first
time
she
held
up
her
hands
and
exclaimed
at
the
noise
and
bustle
of
the
high
soldiers
who
were
for
ever
marching
to
and
fro
in
companies
with
drums
and
pipes
the
lasses
that
went
hither
and
thither
with
a
shawl
about
their
heads
and
bandied
such
swashbucklers
and
rantipole
prentice
lads
the
limmers
they
need
soundly
skelping
said
my
mother
for
a
that
they
carry
their
heads
so
high
and
their
kirtles
higher
than
their
heads
surely
scantly
that
said
my
father
but
ay
continued
my
mother
not
heeding
him
in
her
press
of
speech
such
hempies
wad
be
dookit
in
the
limmers
dub
on
saturday
in
every
decent
country
and
set
on
the
black
stool
of
repentance
ilka
sabbath
day
i
wonder
what
the
king
and
the
ministers
o
edinburgh
can
be
thinkin
o
there
was
however
for
most
of
us
a
long
and
weary
waiting
ere
in
the
town
of
edinburgh
the
high
court
of
justiciary
was
ripe
for
the
hearing
of
the
case
against
the
mures
but
when
at
last
the
great
day
came
the
whole
west
country
was
there
sir
launcelot
kennedy
of
palgowan
and
kirrieoch
appears
somewhat
to
have
confused
the
dates
of
the
first
and
second
trials
of
john
mure
of
auchendrayne
indeed
weakness
in
exact
chronology
is
common
to
his
record
and
to
the
contemporary
historie
of
the
kennedies
which
was
written
about
the
same
time
by
a
partisan
of
the
other
may
even
be
by
john
mure
of
auchendrayne
himself
and
though
many
a
face
was
joyous
as
were
ours
eke
many
were
sad
and
lowering
for
it
is
strange
that
such
ill
men
should
have
some
to
love
them
or
at
least
so
it
was
with
john
mure
the
elder
and
so
there
were
in
the
city
mures
by
the
score
fighting
mackerrows
cankered
craufords
with
all
the
disbanded
bargany
discontents
from
the
south
of
carrick
drummurchie
s
broken
band
from
the
of
barr
together
with
many
others
so
that
we
kept
our
swords
as
at
our
first
visit
to
the
town
in
the
days
of
gilbert
kennedy
free
in
their
scabbards
while
we
ruffled
it
along
the
pavement
and
i
mind
what
my
mother
said
the
first
time
she
went
down
the
plainstones
with
me
we
met
young
anthony
kennedy
of
benane
and
i
perceived
that
it
was
his
intent
to
take
the
wall
of
me
so
i
squared
myself
and
went
a
little
before
with
my
hand
on
my
rapier
hilt
and
my
elbows
wide
also
cocking
fiercely
my
bonnet
over
my
assurance
feared
anthony
so
greatly
that
he
meekly
took
the
pavement
edge
and
i
went
by
with
my
mother
on
my
arm
having
as
i
thought
come
off
very
well
in
the
matter
but
my
mother
stood
stock
still
in
amazement
laddie
laddie
i
kenned
na
what
had
taken
prinked
and
passaged
for
a
the
world
like
our
bantam
cock
at
kirrieoch
when
he
hears
his
neighbour
at
kirriemore
craw
in
the
prime
of
the
morn
gin
ye
gang
on
that
gait
ye
will
get
your
kame
berried
and
scarted
my
lad
so
listen
your
auld
mither
and
walk
mair
at
this
i
was
somewhat
shamed
and
dropped
behind
like
a
little
whipped
messan
for
my
mother
has
a
brisk
tongue
my
father
said
not
a
word
but
there
was
a
look
of
dry
humorsomeness
upon
his
face
which
i
knew
and
feared
more
than
my
mother
s
tongue
great
day
of
at
last
however
the
trial
was
set
and
we
all
summoned
for
our
evidence
it
was
to
be
held
in
the
high
court
of
justiciary
and
was
a
right
solemn
thing
a
hot
day
in
it
proved
with
the
narrow
overcrowded
bounds
of
the
town
drowsed
with
heat
and
yet
eaten
up
with
a
plague
of
flies
the
room
of
the
trial
was
a
large
one
with
a
dais
for
the
judges
at
the
end
the
boxes
for
the
prisoners
and
a
tall
stool
with
steps
and
a
bar
on
which
to
rest
the
hands
for
the
witnesses
and
in
the
long
dark
low
room
what
a
crush
of
people
for
the
report
of
the
monstrous
dealing
of
the
mures
and
the
strangeness
of
their
crimes
had
caused
a
mighty
coil
in
the
town
of
edinburgh
and
in
the
country
round
about
so
that
all
the
time
of
the
trial
there
was
a
constant
hum
about
the
a
continuous
murmur
that
forced
its
way
within
and
now
a
louder
roar
as
the
doors
were
opened
and
shut
by
the
officers
of
the
court
also
in
order
to
show
themselves
busybodies
these
went
and
came
every
minute
or
two
pushing
right
and
left
with
their
halberts
which
the
poor
folk
had
very
peaceably
to
abide
as
best
they
might
but
the
disposition
of
the
rabble
of
the
city
was
a
marvel
to
me
for
being
stirred
up
by
the
bargany
folk
and
by
the
earl
of
dunbar
mure
s
it
was
singularly
unfriendly
to
us
so
that
we
were
almost
feared
that
the
criminals
might
after
all
be
let
off
by
the
overawing
of
the
assize
that
sat
upon
the
case
but
finally
as
it
happened
those
who
were
chosen
were
mostly
landward
gentlemen
of
stout
hearts
and
no
subjection
to
the
clamour
of
the
indeed
as
should
ever
be
placed
upon
the
hearing
of
justice
not
mere
bodies
of
the
luckenbooths
who
if
they
give
the
verdict
against
the
popular
voice
are
liable
to
have
their
shops
and
stalls
plundered
and
james
scrymgeour
of
dudhope
a
good
man
was
made
the
chancellor
of
the
jury
there
were
many
of
the
great
lords
of
session
on
the
bench
for
a
case
so
important
and
notable
had
not
been
tried
for
years
and
the
lords
of
secret
council
appointed
my
lord
president
himself
to
be
in
the
chief
place
in
his
robes
as
well
as
five
other
justices
in
his
company
that
the
dittay
might
be
heard
with
all
equal
mind
and
with
great
motion
of
solemnity
it
was
eleven
by
the
clock
when
the
judges
were
ushered
in
sir
john
fenton
of
fentonbarns
lord
president
coming
first
and
sitting
in
the
midst
then
the
crier
of
the
court
shouted
way
for
his
king
james
the
sext
make
way
and
all
the
people
rose
up
while
king
james
was
coming
in
he
sat
upon
the
bench
with
the
justices
indeed
but
a
little
way
apart
as
having
by
law
no
share
in
their
deliberations
nevertheless
he
was
all
the
time
writing
and
passing
pieces
of
white
paper
to
them
whereat
they
bowed
very
courteously
back
to
him
but
whether
they
took
any
notice
of
their
import
i
know
not
then
the
prisoners
were
brought
in
john
mure
the
elder
with
his
grey
hair
and
commanding
presence
looked
out
of
from
beneath
his
eyebrows
like
a
lion
ignominiously
beset
james
mure
the
younger
came
after
his
father
a
heavy
loutish
ignorant
man
but
somewhat
paled
with
his
bloody
handling
at
the
instance
of
the
lords
of
secret
council
also
in
accordance
with
the
promise
of
earl
john
in
the
matter
of
the
finding
of
the
cave
james
bannatyne
of
chapeldonnan
was
not
set
up
for
trial
along
with
them
which
was
a
wonder
to
many
and
an
outcry
to
some
of
the
evilly
affected
then
the
court
being
set
the
dittay
was
read
solemnly
by
a
very
and
courteous
gentleman
thomas
hamilton
of
byres
the
king
s
advocate
he
spoke
in
a
soft
voice
as
if
he
were
courting
a
lady
and
whenever
he
addressed
a
word
to
the
prisoners
it
was
as
if
he
had
been
their
dearest
friend
and
grieved
that
they
should
thus
stand
in
jeopardy
of
their
lives
yet
or
so
it
seemed
to
me
john
mure
was
ever
his
match
and
answered
him
without
a
moment
s
hesitancy
then
after
the
advocate
s
opening
the
evidence
was
led
they
called
upon
me
first
to
arise
and
i
declare
that
my
knees
trembled
and
shook
as
they
never
did
before
the
shock
of
battle
so
that
only
the
sight
of
nell
s
pale
face
and
my
mother
holding
her
hand
at
all
gave
me
any
shred
of
courage
but
nevertheless
i
went
with
my
tall
hat
in
hand
and
my
damascus
sword
by
my
side
to
the
stance
and
there
i
told
all
that
i
had
of
the
murder
at
the
chapel
of
st
leonards
with
the
matter
of
the
grey
man
who
sat
his
horse
a
little
way
apart
among
the
sandhills
yet
could
i
not
declare
on
mine
oath
that
i
knew
of
a
certainty
that
this
man
was
the
accused
john
mure
of
auchendrayne
though
as
between
man
and
man
i
was
wholly
assured
of
it
i
told
also
of
the
sending
of
the
letter
and
of
the
confusion
of
the
lad
upon
his
return
from
the
house
of
auchendrayne
and
of
all
the
other
matter
which
came
under
my
observation
even
as
i
have
detailed
them
in
this
history
but
more
briefly
then
a
tall
thin
leathery
man
sir
john
russell
the
name
of
him
advocate
for
the
mures
stood
up
and
tried
to
shake
me
in
my
averments
but
he
could
nor
any
other
man
for
i
wasted
no
thought
on
what
i
ought
to
say
but
out
with
the
plain
truth
so
that
he
could
not
break
down
the
impregnable
wall
of
the
thing
that
was
neither
make
me
say
that
which
was
not
then
there
came
one
after
the
other
the
dominie
meg
dalrymple
robert
harburgh
and
lastly
my
own
nell
but
they
had
little
more
to
tell
than
i
had
told
at
the
first
till
the
herald
of
the
court
cried
out
for
marjorie
mure
or
kennedy
called
in
the
pleas
the
younger
lady
of
auchendrayne
then
pale
as
a
lily
flower
is
pale
clad
in
white
and
with
her
hair
daintily
and
smoothly
braided
she
rose
and
gave
her
hand
to
my
lord
cassillis
who
brought
her
with
all
dignity
and
observance
to
the
witness
stance
so
firmly
she
stood
within
it
that
she
seemed
a
figure
of
some
goddess
done
in
alabaster
the
like
of
that
which
i
had
once
seen
at
the
entering
in
of
the
king
s
palace
at
holy
rood
house
there
was
the
stillest
silence
while
marjorie
told
her
tale
the
king
stood
up
in
his
place
with
his
hat
on
his
head
to
look
at
her
the
judges
gazed
as
though
they
had
seen
a
ghost
but
in
an
even
voice
she
related
all
the
terrible
story
making
it
clear
as
crystal
till
there
stood
out
the
full
wickedness
of
the
unparalleled
murders
you
are
the
wife
of
james
mure
the
younger
prisoner
said
the
man
of
leather
the
advocate
russell
how
then
do
you
appear
to
give
evidence
against
him
i
was
first
the
daughter
of
thomas
kennedy
of
culzean
whom
these
men
slew
said
she
and
this
was
her
sole
answer
the
lawyers
for
the
defence
as
was
their
duty
tried
to
make
it
out
that
her
evidence
was
prejudiced
and
so
to
shake
it
but
the
king
broke
out
upon
them
no
more
than
we
are
all
prejudiced
against
foul
murder
so
they
were
silenced
but
the
judges
were
manifestly
ill
at
ease
and
shifted
in
their
even
the
king
had
not
liberty
of
speech
in
that
place
yet
no
man
said
him
nay
because
he
was
the
king
and
save
it
were
maister
robert
bruce
not
many
cared
to
brook
his
sudden
violent
rages
then
was
entered
james
bannatyne
who
had
been
brought
to
confession
in
what
fashion
it
boots
not
to
inquire
and
he
in
his
turn
detailed
line
by
line
all
the
iniquity
so
it
seemed
that
now
the
net
was
indeed
woven
about
the
cruel
plotters
but
my
lord
president
by
the
king
s
authority
was
instant
with
the
prisoners
to
confess
the
murdering
of
sir
thomas
and
of
the
even
offering
his
life
but
no
more
to
either
of
them
who
would
reveal
the
matter
and
tell
who
were
complices
in
the
conspiracy
and
i
think
james
mure
the
younger
was
a
little
moved
at
this
offer
for
i
saw
him
very
plainly
move
and
shift
the
hand
that
was
upon
his
head
his
father
watched
him
with
a
sharp
eye
and
once
set
his
manacled
wrist
upon
his
son
s
shoulder
as
it
had
been
to
encourage
him
to
remain
firm
he
himself
stood
erect
and
undaunted
all
the
time
of
the
trial
like
a
tower
of
ancient
strength
while
his
son
sat
upon
a
stool
with
his
back
against
the
bars
of
the
box
as
it
seemed
careless
of
the
crimes
which
were
alleged
against
him
he
had
not
even
lifted
his
eyes
when
his
wife
marjorie
went
into
the
place
of
witnessing
at
last
it
was
all
over
and
the
men
of
the
jury
spoke
earnestly
together
while
john
mure
watched
them
with
his
lionlike
eyes
shining
from
under
his
hassock
of
grey
hair
the
king
sat
impatiently
drumming
his
hands
upon
a
rail
he
would
have
liked
i
could
see
to
go
over
to
confer
with
them
but
even
king
jamie
had
hardly
dared
so
much
as
that
after
a
short
space
for
consultation
their
president
of
assize
sir
james
scrymgeour
stood
up
in
the
body
of
the
court
with
a
little
paper
in
his
hand
king
s
lieges
all
are
ye
agreed
in
your
verdict
asked
my
lord
president
we
are
said
sir
james
firmly
and
what
is
your
finding
there
was
a
great
and
mighty
silence
so
that
the
anxious
tapping
of
the
king
s
fingers
on
the
wooden
bench
could
be
heard
we
find
them
both
said
sir
james
he
would
have
said
more
in
due
form
but
there
was
a
thunderous
shout
from
all
the
westland
folk
that
were
in
the
hall
so
that
no
more
could
be
heard
but
the
king
was
seen
upon
his
feet
commanding
silence
and
the
macers
of
the
court
struck
here
and
there
among
them
that
shouted
then
when
the
tumult
within
was
a
little
hushed
my
lord
president
rose
to
pronounce
sentence
but
he
had
scarce
opened
his
mouth
when
there
came
through
the
open
windows
the
angry
roaring
of
the
mob
without
for
the
news
had
already
reached
them
and
dunbar
and
others
were
busily
employed
stirring
them
up
to
make
a
tumult
on
behalf
of
the
murderers
my
lord
president
had
a
noble
voice
and
the
words
of
condemnation
came
clear
and
solemn
from
him
so
that
they
were
heard
above
the
din
by
every
ear
in
the
and
even
as
far
as
the
outer
port
we
discern
and
adjudge
john
mure
of
auchendrayne
and
james
mure
his
son
and
apparent
heir
to
be
ta
en
to
the
mercat
cross
of
edinburgh
and
there
their
heads
to
be
stricken
from
their
being
culpable
and
convict
of
many
treasonable
and
heinous
crimes
which
is
pronounced
for
doom
and
when
the
officers
had
removed
the
prisoners
marjorie
kennedy
walked
forth
from
the
hall
of
judgment
as
silent
and
composed
as
though
she
had
been
coming
out
of
the
kirk
on
a
still
summer
s
morning
with
her
bible
in
her
hand
last
of
the
grey
it
was
the
morn
of
the
execution
justice
delayed
for
long
was
that
day
to
let
fall
its
sword
we
of
the
cassillis
colours
mustered
in
the
dead
of
the
night
for
there
was
no
force
save
the
city
guard
within
the
walls
and
we
had
recently
had
overly
many
proofs
how
little
these
men
could
do
with
the
unruly
commons
of
edinburgh
if
it
pleased
them
to
be
turbulent
so
it
had
come
to
be
bruited
abroad
that
there
was
an
intent
to
prevent
the
execution
and
deliver
the
murderers
out
of
the
hands
of
justice
but
we
were
resolved
that
this
should
not
be
so
as
was
our
bounden
duty
we
armed
us
to
support
the
right
and
to
keep
the
king
s
peace
against
all
riotous
the
earl
gave
to
me
the
command
of
one
half
of
the
band
reserving
the
other
for
himself
and
already
he
called
me
sir
launcelot
though
i
had
not
yet
received
the
acknowledgment
of
knighthood
from
the
king
at
the
first
break
of
day
it
was
to
be
done
of
this
we
had
private
notice
from
the
turnkey
of
the
tolbooth
i
had
worked
earnestly
upon
my
mother
and
nell
that
they
should
abide
from
the
was
indeed
not
for
womankind
to
see
though
i
knew
that
there
would
be
many
there
ay
even
dames
gentle
of
degree
but
my
father
marched
with
me
shall
i
put
my
harness
off
me
said
he
when
there
is
a
chance
of
a
tumult
and
of
the
defeating
of
the
solemn
justice
of
providence
and
of
king
james
god
forbid
wife
help
me
on
with
my
so
i
placed
my
father
in
my
own
command
and
i
set
him
in
the
second
rank
with
hugh
of
kirriemore
beside
him
and
robert
harburgh
in
front
of
him
where
i
judged
he
would
not
come
to
any
great
harm
and
we
kennedies
had
the
king
s
private
permission
thus
to
come
through
the
town
under
arms
when
we
arrived
at
the
place
the
tall
scaffold
had
already
been
set
up
at
the
cross
and
even
ere
we
arrayed
us
first
about
it
many
a
candle
had
begun
to
wink
here
and
there
in
the
tall
windows
of
the
high
street
the
earl
was
to
command
a
second
strong
guard
from
the
prison
port
to
the
scaffold
lest
the
rabble
should
try
to
overwhelm
the
city
guard
and
the
marshal
s
men
as
they
convoyed
the
prisoners
to
the
place
of
execution
thus
we
of
the
first
band
stood
grimly
to
our
arms
a
long
time
after
the
gloaming
of
the
morning
began
the
hum
of
the
folk
gathering
surrounded
us
there
was
however
little
pleasance
or
laughing
as
there
is
at
an
ordinary
heading
or
hanging
and
that
did
not
betoken
good
for
when
the
populace
is
silent
it
is
plotting
this
much
i
had
learned
in
my
long
service
and
afterwards
as
a
therefore
i
hold
it
the
true
wisdom
to
strike
ere
the
can
bite
that
at
least
is
my
thought
of
it
slowly
and
slowly
three
or
four
dark
figures
on
the
scaffold
grew
clearer
to
our
eyes
till
we
could
see
the
headsman
and
his
assistants
waiting
patiently
for
their
work
to
be
brought
to
them
the
chief
of
these
was
a
man
mighty
of
his
arms
he
had
a
black
mask
upon
his
face
and
was
naked
even
to
the
waist
a
leathern
apron
like
a
smith
s
was
done
about
his
loins
and
he
stood
leaning
his
broad
axe
upon
the
block
the
sun
was
just
beginning
to
redden
the
clouds
in
the
east
when
the
door
of
the
tolbooth
fell
open
with
a
loud
noise
at
the
very
same
moment
the
rooks
and
jackdaws
arose
in
a
perfect
cloud
from
the
pinnacles
of
st
giles
as
well
as
from
the
whole
city
and
in
a
black
clanging
cloud
they
drifted
seaward
which
was
looked
upon
as
a
marvel
by
them
that
watched
for
freits
for
they
said
these
be
john
mure
s
devils
that
have
forsaken
and
indeed
whether
there
was
aught
in
it
or
no
certain
is
it
that
the
birds
came
not
back
for
many
days
at
least
not
to
my
seeing
but
then
i
was
much
occupied
with
other
matters
as
the
procession
came
out
the
earl
john
and
his
men
filed
on
either
side
in
a
triple
line
with
the
of
the
guard
marching
close
about
the
prisoners
john
mure
walked
first
in
his
grey
cloak
but
bareheaded
striding
reverend
and
strong
before
all
behind
him
came
his
son
and
hand
in
hand
with
him
o
marvel
of
marvels
was
she
that
had
been
in
name
his
wife
even
marjorie
kennedy
and
as
they
came
the
light
grew
clearer
there
seemed
to
be
almost
a
smile
upon
the
lady
marjorie
s
face
and
james
mure
listened
intently
as
she
spoke
low
and
steadily
to
him
for
marjorie
had
in
these
days
become
as
it
seemed
a
woman
removed
from
us
supported
by
no
earthly
food
for
none
touched
her
lips
her
strength
being
upheld
by
some
power
from
above
at
least
so
i
think
she
had
received
permission
from
the
king
to
be
with
her
husband
in
his
last
hours
i
have
fulfilled
the
lord
s
justice
for
my
duty
was
laid
upon
me
she
said
but
i
would
not
kill
both
body
and
how
she
effected
it
i
know
not
but
certain
it
is
that
during
the
weeks
of
waiting
she
had
won
james
mure
in
some
sort
to
contrition
and
prayer
and
now
with
his
hand
in
hers
they
walked
together
along
the
short
way
to
the
scaffold
foot
but
old
john
mure
strode
scornfully
on
before
heedful
neither
of
man
nor
woman
and
i
swear
that
i
could
not
but
in
some
measure
admire
at
him
devil
of
cruelty
as
he
was
they
climbed
the
mure
calmly
as
though
he
were
leading
a
lady
to
a
banquet
his
son
faltered
and
had
fallen
at
the
ladder
foot
save
for
the
hand
of
marjorie
who
walked
in
white
by
his
side
accompanying
him
faithfully
to
his
end
i
am
his
wife
she
said
it
was
i
who
brought
him
to
this
ye
will
not
twain
me
from
him
on
this
day
of
shame
never
have
i
owned
james
mure
as
my
husband
before
but
i
own
him
these
were
her
words
when
the
captain
of
the
guard
was
instant
with
her
to
depart
home
and
i
declare
that
the
doomed
man
looked
at
her
with
something
like
a
beast
s
dumb
gratitude
in
his
eyes
which
when
you
think
on
it
is
a
thing
marvellous
enough
and
i
ask
not
that
it
shall
be
believed
yet
i
saw
it
and
will
at
any
time
uphold
the
truth
of
it
with
my
sword
if
need
be
at
last
they
stood
upon
the
scaffold
platform
and
the
headsman
made
ready
then
there
sounded
above
the
mingled
roar
of
the
multitude
the
blowing
of
a
trumpet
and
the
king
s
gay
favourite
the
duke
of
lennox
rode
to
the
foot
of
the
stage
he
had
a
paper
in
his
hand
a
pardon
a
pardon
yelled
the
people
my
heart
gave
a
great
leap
and
stood
still
they
never
dare
cried
i
lads
stand
firm
if
the
king
hath
pardoned
the
murderers
shall
we
of
the
west
will
ye
follow
me
lads
and
they
whispered
back
ay
that
we
will
we
will
help
you
to
do
justice
upon
them
the
mures
shall
never
leave
this
place
alive
though
we
all
die
also
we
shall
not
go
back
to
carrick
shamed
by
these
men
s
so
we
arranged
it
if
by
any
chance
there
should
be
news
of
a
reprieve
for
it
was
by
singular
good
hap
that
we
were
the
only
company
under
arms
in
the
city
save
the
few
men
of
the
town
guard
but
when
lennox
made
his
way
to
the
scaffold
we
heard
another
way
of
it
i
was
almost
underneath
the
staging
upon
the
front
and
heard
that
which
was
said
almost
every
word
the
king
to
you
two
traitors
about
to
die
he
read
his
majesty
desires
greatly
to
be
informed
of
the
certainty
of
these
things
whereof
you
have
been
accused
and
for
which
you
have
been
justly
murder
of
sir
thomas
kennedy
the
matter
of
the
bloody
dagger
thrown
at
the
red
house
the
treasure
of
kelwood
and
its
taking
out
of
the
changehouse
on
the
red
moss
his
majesty
the
king
offers
life
and
his
clemency
in
a
perpetual
exile
upon
some
warded
isle
to
the
first
of
you
that
will
reveal
the
whole
the
king
s
favourite
ceased
his
reading
and
looked
at
the
condemned
men
and
john
mure
in
his
plain
grey
cloak
which
he
had
not
yet
laid
aside
looked
askance
at
lennox
who
shone
like
a
butterfly
in
gay
colours
being
tricked
out
in
the
latest
fitful
extravagancies
of
fashion
we
shall
be
grateful
to
his
majesty
all
our
lives
said
he
sneeringly
but
the
solomon
of
scotland
is
so
wise
that
he
can
easily
certify
himself
of
the
truth
of
these
things
without
our
poor
but
james
mure
the
younger
where
he
stood
with
his
wife
by
his
side
seemed
a
little
struck
with
the
message
and
began
to
listen
with
interest
read
that
again
he
said
to
lennox
abruptly
and
lennox
prinking
and
preening
him
like
a
indian
bird
in
my
lady
s
bower
read
the
king
s
mandate
over
again
john
mure
watched
his
son
with
the
eye
of
a
crouching
wild
cat
the
younger
man
was
about
to
utter
something
when
his
father
said
quickly
to
lennox
i
pray
thee
my
lord
duke
may
i
speak
with
you
a
moment
apart
i
am
the
first
to
accept
the
offer
and
with
that
they
came
both
of
them
to
the
side
of
the
scaffold
where
i
was
on
guard
leaving
james
mure
standing
with
drooping
head
by
the
block
hark
ye
my
lord
said
auchendrayne
the
elder
thy
master
s
terms
are
fair
enough
to
be
offered
to
a
dying
man
on
the
scaffold
i
will
take
them
but
on
condition
that
my
son
be
executed
before
i
reveal
the
secret
for
there
are
but
two
of
us
left
and
we
have
been
close
to
one
another
all
our
lives
i
would
not
therefore
have
my
son
think
that
i
being
an
old
man
for
the
sake
of
a
year
or
two
of
longer
life
would
reveal
those
matters
for
which
he
has
already
suffered
the
torture
of
the
extreme
question
with
so
great
constancy
both
in
the
king
s
inquest
chamber
and
before
the
lords
of
secret
that
is
easily
arranged
said
lennox
dusting
at
his
doublet
i
have
but
to
give
the
word
to
the
executioner
and
he
will
do
his
duty
first
upon
your
son
then
he
will
halt
till
you
have
accepted
the
king
s
mercy
and
given
pledge
and
earnest
of
full
revelations
concerning
these
hidden
and
mysterious
this
was
lennox
s
customary
manner
of
he
had
learned
it
in
the
english
court
with
womanish
conceits
and
a
flood
of
words
and
gestures
and
as
he
spoke
he
smiled
upon
john
mure
as
though
the
old
grey
man
in
the
cloak
and
reverend
beard
had
been
some
young
and
dame
of
the
court
and
so
taken
up
with
himself
was
he
that
he
did
not
observe
the
basilisk
look
which
the
turned
upon
him
lennox
held
up
his
hand
to
the
executioner
in
the
king
s
name
he
cried
to
the
man
in
the
mask
do
thine
office
upon
the
younger
first
and
these
are
not
my
orders
quoth
he
in
the
mask
curtly
lennox
flashed
a
little
ebon
staff
with
a
golden
crown
set
upon
the
summit
before
his
eyes
would
st
thou
with
me
he
said
then
right
soon
another
shall
take
thy
bishopric
and
as
thou
dost
others
shalt
shepherd
thee
to
whereat
marjorie
robed
in
her
white
took
the
hand
of
james
mure
the
man
that
was
about
to
die
husband
said
she
calmly
i
have
asked
pardon
for
thee
from
thou
also
ask
it
now
ere
swift
death
take
thee
ask
it
both
from
god
and
for
she
had
been
his
ministrant
angel
in
the
prison
and
her
own
heart
being
in
the
drinking
not
seeming
so
sweet
a
cup
as
it
had
appeared
in
the
mixing
she
had
also
won
the
sullen
mechanic
heart
of
him
who
according
to
the
law
of
the
land
had
been
so
long
her
husband
she
had
showed
him
the
way
to
a
certain
sum
of
faith
penitence
and
hope
which
perchance
he
snatched
at
not
so
much
for
themselves
but
as
the
best
things
which
were
left
to
him
james
won
thou
forth
on
thy
way
fear
not
thou
shalt
not
be
long
alone
she
said
to
him
and
staggering
a
little
he
moved
across
the
scaffold
he
would
have
fallen
but
that
marjorie
set
his
hand
upon
her
shoulder
and
put
her
arm
about
him
so
he
came
forward
stumbling
like
a
man
in
sore
sickness
as
doubtless
he
was
i
am
a
sinful
man
he
said
so
that
some
at
least
could
hear
him
pray
for
me
good
people
keep
your
hands
from
blood
as
i
have
not
kept
mine
and
marjorie
though
thou
didst
never
love
me
love
me
now
and
bide
with
me
till
i
fear
not
she
said
i
will
stand
beside
thee
and
not
only
here
i
have
a
message
that
i
shall
right
soon
be
called
to
journey
with
thee
further
meeting
thee
somewhere
by
the
way
that
thou
must
and
calling
him
again
sweet
brother
and
james
she
laid
down
his
neck
upon
the
block
and
with
one
blow
the
headsman
featly
did
his
office
but
marjorie
stood
still
and
received
the
poor
head
in
a
decent
napkin
after
the
masked
man
had
held
it
up
john
mure
looked
at
her
and
at
her
son
all
the
time
and
an
evil
and
contemptuous
light
shone
in
his
eyes
madam
he
said
it
had
done
no
harm
had
you
begun
your
care
and
attendance
somewhat
earlier
ye
might
have
made
a
decent
preacher
out
of
james
he
was
never
muckle
worth
for
aught
then
lennox
came
forward
again
with
his
paper
now
john
mure
he
said
we
have
done
according
to
your
desire
ye
will
now
i
doubt
not
having
seen
the
end
and
reward
of
iniquity
in
the
person
of
your
son
accept
his
majesty
s
so
marvellous
clemency
and
be
content
to
reveal
all
the
he
came
a
little
near
to
the
old
man
airily
whisking
his
paper
with
his
forefinger
john
mure
waved
him
aside
with
one
hand
and
held
his
nose
with
the
other
pah
get
apart
from
me
civet
cat
he
cried
think
ye
that
i
will
have
any
dealings
with
you
or
with
your
dullard
fool
master
king
i
saw
that
ye
might
perchance
were
i
first
turned
to
dead
clay
and
lappered
blood
chance
to
get
something
out
of
james
there
i
saw
him
look
somewhat
too
eagerly
on
your
reprieve
for
much
belated
domesticity
had
turned
him
soft
so
i
played
with
you
and
now
wot
ye
well
ye
shall
know
nothing
from
me
that
your
precious
solomon
of
asses
can
not
divine
for
himself
he
took
off
his
cloak
of
grey
and
lace
collar
baring
his
neck
for
the
dead
stroke
stay
he
said
to
lennox
since
your
wise
king
is
so
curious
here
is
a
history
of
divers
matters
that
may
interest
your
master
it
may
do
him
some
the
new
minister
of
edinburgh
a
man
came
near
john
mure
looked
at
him
of
what
religion
art
thou
he
asked
ay
verily
of
the
king
s
religion
were
my
time
not
so
circumscribed
i
would
have
at
thee
with
texts
thou
rogue
ay
and
would
swinge
thee
with
them
soundly
in
what
religion
dost
thou
die
said
the
minister
for
it
was
a
customary
question
in
those
days
when
men
were
forced
to
live
and
die
on
the
borderland
of
many
creeds
john
mure
smiled
as
he
bent
his
head
to
the
block
of
the
ancientest
persuasion
said
he
for
i
am
ready
to
believe
in
any
god
whom
i
may
chance
to
meet
in
my
pilgriming
but
in
none
will
i
believe
till
i
do
meet
him
nevertheless
do
thou
like
a
wise
silly
bishop
stick
to
the
king
and
thy
printed
book
which
saying
was
remembered
when
the
minister
was
afterward
made
a
bishop
by
the
king
s
favour
with
these
words
john
mure
threw
out
his
hands
with
a
sharp
that
was
the
customary
signal
the
broad
axe
rose
and
fell
flashing
in
the
sun
a
moment
ere
it
crashed
dully
upon
the
block
the
westland
men
gave
a
shout
and
the
heathen
spirit
of
john
mure
of
auchendrayne
carrying
such
a
load
of
sin
and
bloodshedding
as
never
soul
did
before
or
since
fared
forth
alone
to
its
own
place
s
even
as
the
axe
was
falling
marjorie
kennedy
sank
down
upon
the
platform
of
the
scaffold
as
though
the
stroke
had
fallen
upon
her
i
sheathed
my
sword
and
sprang
upon
the
slippery
stage
to
hold
her
up
when
i
took
her
in
my
arms
she
was
soft
and
pliable
in
all
her
limbs
like
a
little
child
till
now
she
had
been
like
a
woman
of
steel
or
rather
like
one
carven
in
alabaster
as
i
have
said
but
now
she
lay
in
my
arms
like
a
babe
on
the
nurse
s
lap
we
carried
her
homeward
making
strangely
enough
for
some
distance
but
one
procession
with
the
bodies
which
were
going
to
be
buried
without
the
wall
while
the
heads
were
taken
to
be
set
on
the
pikes
of
the
nether
bow
to
the
earl
john
s
own
lodging
we
brought
her
and
in
a
room
with
a
wide
window
we
laid
her
down
on
a
bed
then
we
stood
silently
about
her
nell
and
i
being
nearest
in
a
little
while
marjorie
turned
her
head
to
the
window
the
sun
had
risen
on
the
sea
a
north
wind
was
blowing
all
was
very
blue
and
smacked
of
the
morning
freshness
for
the
window
was
open
and
the
sea
air
blew
off
the
firth
almost
as
salt
it
was
wont
to
blow
in
at
the
windows
of
culzean
thrice
she
moved
her
lips
to
speak
but
till
the
fourth
time
no
word
came
i
have
done
the
work
appointed
she
said
i
ken
not
if
i
have
done
it
she
paused
a
little
and
her
eyes
as
she
looked
at
the
sea
were
very
wide
and
wistful
it
is
a
hard
saying
that
vengeance
is
his
i
thought
it
would
be
she
said
but
now
in
the
mouth
it
is
hush
thee
marjorie
whispered
my
nell
it
was
the
justice
of
god
upon
the
murderers
of
our
and
i
thought
that
she
spoke
well
but
marjorie
waved
her
aside
like
enough
she
answered
quietly
as
one
that
has
not
strength
to
argue
but
yet
holds
the
contrary
opinion
done
at
least
is
marjorie
s
task
i
journey
forth
to
take
my
wages
fare
you
she
turned
her
face
a
little
outward
so
that
she
could
look
upon
the
sea
and
the
fife
lomonds
a
dearer
shore
she
said
softly
and
then
she
started
a
little
quickly
as
if
she
had
waked
from
sleep
where
am
i
she
asked
but
ere
we
could
nell
who
stood
close
beside
her
and
stroked
her
brow
with
a
soft
hand
she
went
on
oh
what
am
i
saying
i
was
thinking
on
our
garden
at
culzean
with
its
rose
walks
and
the
sweet
dreaming
scent
of
the
sea
she
looked
up
at
me
as
it
had
been
almost
archly
yet
so
as
almost
to
break
my
heart
launcelot
lad
she
said
hast
thou
thy
gage
that
i
gave
thee
there
ye
thought
me
once
to
be
sweet
and
i
liked
you
laddie
i
liked
something
just
an
inch
on
the
hither
side
of
loving
but
now
nelly
will
love
thee
a
mile
on
the
further
side
come
you
nell
she
said
beckoning
her
brave
sweet
sister
let
not
thy
sharp
tongue
longer
injure
thy
warm
heart
give
me
your
hand
little
sister
nelly
where
is
it
i
can
not
the
bright
shining
and
finding
nell
s
hand
she
put
it
into
mine
across
the
bed
bairns
she
said
even
so
keep
them
till
the
world
ends
then
for
a
short
space
she
was
silent
and
when
she
spoke
again
it
was
very
low
so
that
none
save
nell
and
i
could
hear
but
the
words
made
us
tingle
as
we
caught
them
gilbert
she
was
saying
in
a
whisper
clear
and
distinct
is
it
not
sweet
to
walk
thus
hand
in
hand
on
the
green
meadows
are
not
the
spring
flowers
sweet
lad
of
my
love
shall
i
sing
thee
a
song
about
them
for
though
thou
know
st
it
not
i
can
sing
both
high
and
then
she
spoke
as
it
had
been
liltingly
and
gladsomely
gilbert
let
me
set
this
spray
of
the
bonny
birk
above
thine
heart
methinks
it
hath
a
strange
look
i
kenned
not
that
it
grew
in
this
she
broke
into
a
weird
lilt
of
song
that
sent
the
tears
hasting
to
our
eyes
but
marjorie
was
smiling
as
she
never
smiled
on
me
and
that
made
me
weep
the
more
it
neither
grew
in
syke
nor
yet
in
any
sheuch
at
the
gates
o
paradise
birk
grew
fair
gilbert
gilbert
she
said
lovingly
crooning
like
one
that
is
caressed
is
not
this
right
winsome
that
we
are
walking
here
together
on
the
living
all
our
fashes
all
our
troubles
left
quite
behind
us
there
was
surely
something
long
ago
that
wearied
us
something
that
parted
us
and
twained
us
i
can
not
mind
what
it
was
i
shall
not
try
to
remember
but
love
of
mine
it
shall
separate
us
no
more
for
ever
and
ever
her
voice
had
almost
gone
but
once
again
it
came
louder
keep
my
hand
gilbert
she
said
trembling
a
little
there
is
a
mist
coming
up
over
the
green
betwixt
me
and
the
cold
cold
mist
from
the
sea
but
keep
thou
my
hand
dear
love
clasp
it
tighter
and
it
will
pass
i
saw
the
death
sweat
break
on
her
brow
gilbert
gilbert
she
whispered
searching
above
her
with
her
hands
and
opening
her
arms
clasp
me
closer
i
can
not
see
thee
love
for
the
mist
i
can
not
feel
your
i
bent
my
ear
i
thought
she
was
gone
from
us
but
as
from
an
infinite
distance
i
heard
the
words
come
to
me
they
were
the
last
spoken
with
great
relief
the
mist
has
gone
by
dear
love
the
mist
has
quite
gone
by
and
she
lay
still
smiling
most
sweetly
the
snows
of
another
winter
had
fallen
frozen
and
lain
long
ere
they
were
at
last
whisked
away
by
the
winds
of
a
brisk
and
bitter
march
it
was
now
again
the
springtime
upon
the
face
of
the
time
of
the
earliest
singing
of
the
mavis
of
the
sweet
piping
of
the
blackbird
on
the
tree
the
grasses
were
green
too
over
the
unforgotten
grave
of
our
marjorie
but
we
who
loved
her
had
won
to
a
memory
that
was
not
now
wholly
sorrow
specially
we
remembered
the
sweet
and
profitable
end
she
had
made
when
after
many
days
of
bitter
winter
in
her
heart
forgiveness
and
love
at
last
unsealed
her
bosom
it
had
been
a
long
winter
for
us
all
because
it
behoved
that
i
should
go
to
london
there
to
be
made
one
of
his
majesty
s
new
knights
for
i
had
told
all
my
tale
to
the
king
being
so
charged
by
the
earl
john
yet
said
he
keep
ever
your
thumb
upon
the
matter
of
the
treasure
of
kelwood
and
i
will
keep
mine
right
effectually
upon
currie
the
thief
and
so
he
did
and
for
the
same
laird
of
kelwood
s
sake
chiefly
he
set
to
mending
and
patching
our
old
tower
of
defence
on
craig
ailsa
in
which
he
gave
one
hamilton
the
charge
of
him
as
prisoner
together
with
john
dick
the
traitor
and
two
or
three
more
it
was
a
fine
quiet
place
said
the
earl
john
and
would
give
such
rascals
time
and
opportunity
for
added
he
seems
more
than
i
am
ever
likely
to
get
with
all
this
throng
of
business
on
for
the
earl
john
was
now
waxen
one
of
the
greatest
men
in
broad
scotland
and
withal
he
had
all
the
power
worth
considering
in
the
shire
of
ayr
so
that
even
the
craufords
wanting
now
their
ancient
chief
and
broken
with
bickerings
among
themselves
sent
an
embassy
of
peace
and
goodwill
to
him
it
chanced
that
it
came
when
the
earl
was
in
a
good
humour
ah
john
crauford
said
cassillis
tis
a
changed
day
since
bargany
and
you
chased
us
off
skeldon
haughs
it
looks
as
if
the
sow
had
not
been
flitted
so
far
after
all
but
ye
shall
have
the
peace
ye
ask
for
we
live
under
a
gracious
king
who
loves
quietness
as
much
as
when
he
dwelt
here
in
our
kindly
north
and
he
is
now
the
better
able
to
enforce
it
therefore
look
ye
to
it
i
will
maintain
you
craufords
in
your
heritages
of
by
my
power
as
bailzie
i
might
legally
declare
forfeit
but
i
will
tell
you
what
ye
must
do
in
return
ye
shall
render
me
place
and
precedence
at
kirk
and
market
ye
shall
build
up
your
private
door
in
dalrymple
kirk
and
ye
shall
abide
from
taking
your
places
there
till
ye
have
seen
me
to
this
dourly
enough
the
craufords
perforce
agreed
for
indeed
they
could
make
no
better
of
it
so
great
a
man
was
our
earl
grown
but
to
me
he
was
ever
kind
and
proved
none
so
when
it
liked
him
for
he
said
build
you
the
house
of
palgowan
and
i
will
plenish
it
for
you
and
that
not
meanly
and
you
and
my
cousin
nell
shall
rear
me
routh
of
lusty
knaves
to
protect
my
marches
and
keep
down
the
reivers
of
the
dungeon
which
indeed
so
far
as
i
was
concerned
i
was
right
willing
to
promise
so
it
came
about
that
the
earl
would
have
it
that
our
wedding
must
be
held
in
the
ancient
strength
of
cassillis
which
sits
by
the
waterside
not
so
far
from
the
town
of
ayr
and
a
bonny
place
it
like
culzean
which
stands
blusteringly
on
the
seabrink
all
and
because
the
earl
of
cassillis
said
it
so
it
was
bound
to
be
for
he
was
our
nell
s
guardian
and
besides
we
that
were
to
live
under
him
were
none
the
worse
of
keeping
in
with
him
when
i
went
to
do
my
courting
as
often
as
not
i
found
nell
walking
with
him
and
ofttimes
flouting
him
and
when
i
would
have
cautioned
her
tut
she
said
he
likes
nothing
better
if
his
own
wife
flouted
him
he
might
stay
better
at
cousin
nell
would
say
to
him
sometimes
cousin
john
ye
think
ye
are
such
a
great
man
yet
a
little
or
a
woman
s
bodkin
might
let
all
thy
greatness
out
ye
should
think
oftener
on
that
what
nell
said
he
is
it
that
the
hour
of
thy
marriage
grows
so
near
that
thou
must
test
thy
preaching
on
me
keep
the
proof
of
the
pudding
for
thine
own
ah
said
she
perchance
my
cousin
the
noble
countess
has
already
given
thee
thy
fill
of
thou
art
a
forward
chit
said
he
wringing
her
ear
between
his
finger
and
thumb
i
hope
launce
will
swinge
thee
tightly
with
a
supple
birch
for
thy
often
it
was
indeed
a
notable
day
when
nell
and
i
were
married
all
the
morning
my
heart
was
beating
a
fine
tune
lest
something
should
happen
ere
i
got
my
lass
carried
off
to
our
home
alone
i
rode
from
the
cove
of
culzean
to
the
house
of
cassillis
i
started
brave
and
early
and
my
good
old
horse
dom
nicholas
rode
for
once
the
right
road
and
the
ready
the
gate
that
i
longed
to
go
i
had
a
rare
fine
coat
of
blue
silk
upon
me
belted
about
the
waist
with
the
king
s
belt
and
with
the
king
s
order
of
knighthood
all
upon
my
breast
was
my
coat
and
of
solid
silver
too
were
the
accoutrements
of
dom
to
the
very
stirrups
and
the
broidery
on
his
blue
i
wore
the
earl
s
damascus
sword
his
first
gift
swinging
at
my
side
and
as
dom
nicholas
and
i
went
through
maybole
wot
ye
if
we
kept
not
our
heads
up
for
the
lasses
ran
out
in
clouds
to
watch
us
go
past
and
what
was
even
better
the
lads
sulked
and
turned
their
backs
saying
that
they
would
be
shamed
to
lay
a
leg
across
a
horse
s
back
thus
appareled
for
i
knew
well
what
they
were
thinking
had
i
been
trudging
afoot
in
hodden
and
they
riding
by
all
in
silk
with
a
sword
that
is
just
what
i
should
have
said
so
the
black
envy
eating
into
their
hearts
and
lowering
on
their
brows
cheered
me
like
old
french
wine
on
a
cold
day
i
had
not
gone
far
across
the
bent
when
i
spied
a
cavalcade
before
me
it
was
the
men
of
culzean
whom
i
had
so
often
led
in
battle
come
to
give
me
a
right
gay
sending
off
and
at
their
head
rode
james
now
the
heir
mirthful
sandy
and
mine
own
little
davie
dressed
like
a
in
satin
of
blue
and
gold
they
gave
me
boisterous
welcome
and
they
that
dared
would
have
broken
many
jests
of
the
sort
upon
my
head
but
on
such
a
day
a
lover
s
head
is
helmeted
alike
against
the
hand
of
war
and
the
strife
of
tongues
the
earl
himself
met
us
at
cassillis
yett
whereupon
i
dismounted
and
bent
upon
a
knee
he
raised
me
right
courteously
and
led
me
within
conversing
all
the
while
as
to
an
equal
such
a
repair
of
folk
i
never
saw
before
in
carrick
or
in
kyle
and
sweetest
of
all
to
me
was
to
see
my
father
for
my
mother
had
bidden
at
home
to
welcome
us
when
we
should
ride
southward
and
among
the
first
that
came
to
bid
me
good
fortune
were
robert
harburgh
and
his
wife
now
so
soon
as
the
eyes
of
my
ancient
love
crossed
mine
i
perceived
well
that
there
was
yet
wickedness
lurking
in
them
and
whensoever
her
husband
was
called
away
on
some
business
of
the
earl
s
i
had
proof
of
it
for
kate
allison
came
near
to
me
and
setting
her
hand
on
the
silver
buttons
of
my
coat
as
though
to
pick
a
thread
she
said
so
i
should
say
sir
it
come
to
this
you
see
there
is
none
so
disdainful
but
in
time
their
fall
will
nay
kate
i
made
answer
it
was
not
i
that
was
first
disdainful
for
do
you
mind
who
it
was
that
told
me
certain
truths
in
the
grieve
s
house
at
culzean
ah
launce
said
kate
allison
own
it
now
was
not
i
a
kind
leech
to
bite
one
i
loved
so
healthily
all
for
his
good
and
for
the
cooling
of
his
blood
kate
allison
said
i
thou
wast
ever
a
minx
a
teasing
rogue
of
rogues
but
thy
disdain
might
have
gone
near
to
costing
me
my
life
go
to
sir
said
she
did
not
i
know
all
the
time
that
thy
love
for
me
was
no
more
than
a
boy
s
fondness
for
kissing
comfits
and
to
be
made
of
by
a
bonny
lass
why
even
then
thou
wast
fonder
of
nell
s
little
finger
than
of
my
whole
i
knew
that
kate
spoke
indeed
it
was
many
months
since
i
had
so
much
as
thought
upon
her
but
this
i
told
her
not
the
lord
knows
how
seldom
she
had
thought
upon
me
but
when
they
meet
together
old
sweethearts
take
pleasure
thus
in
dallying
with
the
past
when
all
wounds
have
been
healed
and
no
hearts
broken
but
she
saw
my
eyes
wandering
as
i
guess
every
way
about
and
she
must
needs
tease
me
concerning
that
also
nay
she
said
you
will
not
see
your
posy
till
she
comes
in
to
the
minister
and
you
so
e
en
content
ye
for
a
little
with
an
old
married
wife
and
the
mother
of
a
family
ye
shall
have
time
and
to
spare
with
your
bonny
bride
or
all
be
kate
i
said
ye
will
be
my
friend
as
of
ay
and
hold
my
tongue
answered
she
quickly
that
you
did
not
always
then
said
i
for
there
never
was
such
an
uncouth
in
the
world
as
with
your
tongue
ye
made
mine
i
dared
not
lay
my
lips
to
a
tender
word
nor
so
much
as
seek
a
favour
as
it
might
be
innocently
betwixt
man
and
maid
but
it
was
that
you
said
to
kate
on
such
a
night
or
think
ye
that
i
count
so
little
on
myself
as
to
be
content
with
kate
allison
s
sweet
speeches
and
the
pretty
besom
laughed
for
though
a
married
wife
she
was
not
a
whit
sobered
as
one
might
see
by
her
eyes
it
served
you
greatly
right
said
she
but
do
me
some
justice
did
you
ever
hear
of
my
telling
of
the
night
of
the
fair
at
maybole
and
of
our
by
the
woodland
way
no
said
i
curtly
for
indeed
i
liked
not
that
memory
specially
well
and
wondered
that
she
did
then
said
kate
allison
rail
no
more
against
woman
s
tongues
for
they
are
moveable
yard
measures
and
let
out
no
more
than
likes
at
this
moment
they
called
to
me
from
the
great
door
and
kate
allison
waved
me
off
with
a
gay
up
and
away
sir
knight
pleased
me
more
from
her
than
many
a
from
another
the
minister
had
come
they
said
and
was
waiting
for
me
i
went
in
and
lo
to
my
wonder
who
should
he
be
but
maister
robert
bruce
the
sequestrated
minister
of
edinburgh
with
whom
the
king
had
at
last
wholly
fallen
out
concerning
the
matter
of
the
gowrie
riot
the
earl
smiled
at
my
wonderment
art
thou
astonished
he
said
thus
to
see
our
ancient
friend
in
carrick
thinkest
thou
that
thy
marriage
will
not
stand
truth
it
will
for
even
king
james
will
think
twice
or
he
bids
his
bishop
unfrock
a
man
that
bides
with
me
in
my
defenced
house
of
sir
launcelot
said
maister
robert
bruce
bending
to
me
with
his
ancient
grace
and
most
reverend
dignity
this
is
the
happiest
hour
with
me
since
i
quitted
my
high
town
upon
the
long
ridge
it
is
true
that
i
wander
like
a
restless
ghost
seeking
abode
but
as
yet
the
king
hath
not
bent
though
thrice
i
have
met
him
in
dispute
and
then
went
the
earl
out
to
bring
in
my
nell
and
i
listened
to
the
minister
of
edinburgh
speaking
yet
on
my
life
i
could
not
fix
my
mind
on
a
word
he
said
for
there
was
a
jangling
as
of
many
bells
in
mine
ears
and
all
the
pulses
of
my
life
beat
together
then
knew
i
of
a
surety
that
none
had
power
to
touch
my
heart
like
nell
kennedy
the
lass
that
would
not
need
to
change
her
name
at
last
the
door
opened
and
she
on
the
earl
s
arm
she
came
there
was
a
rim
of
gold
about
her
hair
like
a
coronet
and
john
of
cassillis
bent
over
to
me
as
he
gave
her
into
my
hand
take
her
he
said
i
have
set
a
coronet
about
her
brows
for
she
is
in
haste
to
be
wed
or
i
might
have
put
a
real
one
there
and
what
had
sir
launcelot
done
then
poor
thing
and
i
think
the
cold
tall
earl
john
was
more
than
a
little
fond
of
our
nell
concerning
which
i
often
rally
her
now
so
nell
and
i
were
married
and
as
though
he
had
known
her
and
her
teasing
temper
maister
robert
bruce
paused
long
on
the
promise
to
obey
when
he
came
to
put
the
questions
to
her
and
also
upon
the
words
obedient
wherefore
i
have
ever
held
him
to
be
a
man
gifted
above
most
with
the
second
sight
it
was
between
the
sweet
hazel
and
the
flowering
may
that
we
rode
two
alone
for
robert
harburgh
had
led
a
company
of
men
with
lances
and
of
young
maids
on
palfreys
as
far
as
the
crossing
of
the
roads
which
come
from
culzean
where
there
met
us
a
party
with
the
loving
cup
but
now
at
long
and
last
we
were
won
clear
and
ever
as
we
rode
we
caught
hands
and
laughed
and
loosed
them
for
gladness
to
be
alone
and
we
looked
in
one
another
s
eyes
and
nigh
brought
ourselves
and
our
horses
to
destruction
by
thus
looking
and
overlooking
till
i
felt
mine
old
dom
nicholas
a
horse
that
loves
not
philandering
grow
restive
and
sulky
under
my
thigh
tossing
his
head
up
as
one
slighted
for
the
unworthy
and
ever
as
we
went
she
charged
it
upon
me
that
then
and
then
and
at
such
another
time
i
loved
her
not
and
ever
i
swore
that
i
did
thereafter
being
beaten
on
that
point
she
fell
to
declaring
that
she
had
loved
me
first
and
i
only
reluctantly
and
as
it
had
been
at
thus
we
made
the
miles
and
the
hours
go
by
redding
up
all
our
past
life
and
planning
our
future
wondering
the
while
if
the
stir
and
clangour
of
war
had
indeed
passed
away
for
ever
for
already
there
had
come
a
new
look
upon
the
land
whether
it
was
the
union
of
the
crowns
and
the
new
english
wealth
which
made
money
more
plenty
i
know
not
at
any
rate
certain
it
is
that
there
had
arrived
a
security
to
which
we
in
the
lands
of
carrick
had
been
strangers
for
many
generations
then
it
was
that
the
farmer
began
to
set
his
oxen
to
the
plough
in
teams
of
a
dozen
or
more
not
fearing
any
longer
that
there
might
come
a
glint
of
riders
over
the
hill
who
should
drive
his
cattle
before
them
and
leave
himself
lying
in
the
furrow
in
his
blood
the
wind
blew
sweet
about
us
it
seemed
that
never
had
there
been
a
spring
like
this
one
since
the
world
began
never
such
delicatest
airs
as
those
that
stirred
the
crisps
about
nell
s
white
neck
when
she
bent
it
sideways
to
hearken
to
my
speeches
i
declare
that
were
i
not
an
unlearned
scot
who
takes
to
his
pen
only
when
work
for
the
sword
waxes
slack
i
could
praise
my
love
in
similitudes
of
arabian
birds
and
ferny
sprays
as
well
as
euphues
delight
or
even
as
in
the
gentle
sydney
his
arcadia
but
as
it
is
i
waste
time
for
already
i
have
spoke
too
long
and
must
haste
me
to
the
end
though
this
is
a
part
of
my
life
that
i
could
love
to
linger
on
for
what
is
pleasanter
than
sunshine
after
storm
and
the
bolts
of
ruin
i
declare
it
was
five
years
since
i
had
had
time
to
look
at
a
robin
but
there
seemed
to
be
time
for
everything
this
fine
may
day
and
ever
as
we
went
it
seemed
that
we
had
been
a
long
time
alone
and
that
it
would
soon
come
time
to
be
turning
back
again
then
to
which
soever
of
us
the
thought
came
that
we
were
now
on
the
long
lane
that
has
no
turning
save
that
which
turns
in
at
the
kirkyaird
loaning
there
would
also
come
the
desire
to
touch
and
to
look
and
even
thus
did
nell
kennedy
often
reaching
her
hand
across
to
me
from
her
gentle
steed
then
would
she
fall
back
on
the
things
that
had
been
and
which
now
were
passed
away
yesterday
at
such
a
time
she
would
say
i
thought
that
would
never
come
and
whereupon
with
her
eyes
she
would
look
the
rest
then
i
told
her
how
that
i
had
seen
the
dominie
but
yestereven
when
she
was
sewing
at
the
pearling
of
her
bridal
dress
and
thinking
of
me
he
had
gone
back
with
his
pipes
to
the
school
by
the
kirk
at
maybole
and
what
said
he
of
our
wedding
asked
my
dear
why
i
was
instant
with
him
to
come
and
bide
at
palgowan
i
made
answer
shall
i
tell
thee
what
he
said
ay
tell
it
me
indeed
quoth
she
blithely
stopping
a
moment
on
a
moorish
summit
with
her
hand
above
her
eyes
and
looking
to
the
spear
of
the
merrick
towards
which
we
rode
well
then
he
said
that
those
that
were
but
newly
wed
had
no
use
for
carven
wherein
to
put
the
ashes
of
their
he
is
none
so
ugly
as
that
said
i
think
a
look
at
me
which
i
took
for
a
certain
complaisance
it
pleased
me
to
see
then
i
told
her
how
the
dominie
had
added
that
it
was
not
yet
time
for
men
of
his
profession
to
come
about
the
house
of
a
knight
but
that
if
prosperity
should
come
to
palgowan
and
the
din
of
bairns
voices
we
might
ask
him
again
in
ten
years
or
somewhat
less
oh
said
nell
shortly
and
rode
a
little
further
off
yet
i
flattered
myself
that
i
had
said
the
thing
pretty
well
for
it
was
not
at
all
in
these
terms
that
the
dominie
had
put
his
offer
indeed
i
was
in
a
quandary
how
most
discreetly
to
deliver
his
message
so
in
the
long
twilight
of
may
we
came
riding
down
minnoch
water
for
with
the
we
had
fallen
silent
and
we
looked
no
more
so
frankly
at
each
other
but
with
one
accord
we
turned
our
eyes
across
the
water
to
watch
for
the
light
of
my
mother
s
candle
in
the
little
window
she
heard
us
as
we
came
and
there
lo
before
i
knew
it
she
was
at
nelly
s
saddle
leather
helping
her
to
dismount
and
the
tears
were
running
steadily
down
her
face
i
think
she
minded
the
day
when
she
too
had
come
home
a
bride
to
the
little
house
of
kirrieoch
among
the
hills
oh
my
bairn
was
what
she
said
come
awa
ben
and
it
was
to
nell
that
she
said
it
me
she
minded
no
more
than
a
under
the
eaves
then
came
hugh
of
kirriemore
out
to
take
the
horses
but
i
went
as
is
my
custom
to
the
stable
with
dom
nicholas
for
he
never
slept
well
otherwise
and
when
i
came
in
again
i
found
that
my
mother
had
nell
already
seated
by
the
fireside
for
it
is
chill
among
the
uplands
in
may
the
peats
were
burning
fine
and
on
the
white
board
there
was
a
supper
set
fit
for
a
prince
and
princess
but
all
the
time
my
mother
never
minded
me
at
all
save
to
rage
on
me
for
bringing
the
lass
so
far
and
so
fast
but
mother
said
i
remember
that
if
i
had
not
made
some
haste
all
your
fine
supper
would
have
been
and
indeed
it
came
not
far
from
being
that
as
it
was
for
we
could
eat
but
little
the
finest
of
muirland
fare
seemed
somehow
or
other
to
stick
by
the
way
tasting
strangely
dry
and
sapless
and
after
we
had
done
we
drew
apart
and
looked
at
the
red
ashes
while
my
mother
rattled
on
about
the
simple
concerns
of
the
sheep
and
the
calves
which
folk
vastly
love
both
to
speak
of
and
to
hear
about
presently
she
leaned
over
me
and
took
down
the
burnt
bible
out
of
the
wall
aumry
here
launce
she
said
read
you
the
chapter
this
night
ere
ye
sleep
it
becomes
a
man
wedded
and
the
head
of
a
family
besides
your
father
is
from
i
declare
i
would
sooner
have
charged
upon
the
level
spears
but
i
had
no
choice
with
my
mother
speaking
as
she
did
when
i
was
a
boy
and
my
nell
sitting
there
crossing
her
pretty
ankles
by
the
fireside
so
i
manned
to
read
a
portion
it
was
about
jonathan
clambering
up
a
rock
and
a
good
soldier
he
was
but
the
prayer
fairly
beat
me
however
ere
we
rose
from
our
knees
we
said
the
lord
s
prayer
all
of
us
together
so
to
rest
we
went
without
other
word
spoken
and
through
the
little
window
of
the
room
in
which
i
was
born
nell
and
i
could
hear
ere
we
went
to
sleep
the
brattle
of
the
burn
hurrying
down
through
the
peace
of
the
hills
past
our
own
new
house
of
palgowan
and
so
on
toward
the
silence
of
the
