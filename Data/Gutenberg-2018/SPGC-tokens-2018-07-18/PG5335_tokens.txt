you
may
contradict
me
as
flat
as
a
flounder
eunice
but
that
won
t
alter
the
facts
there
is
something
in
telepathy
there
is
something
in
if
you
could
read
my
mind
aunt
abby
you
d
drop
that
subject
for
if
you
keep
on
i
may
say
what
i
think
and
oh
that
won
t
bother
me
in
the
least
i
know
what
you
think
but
your
thoughts
are
so
chaotic
so
ignorant
of
the
whole
matter
that
they
are
worthless
now
listen
to
this
from
the
paper
hanlon
will
walk
blindfolded
blindfolded
mind
you
through
the
streets
of
newark
and
will
find
an
article
hidden
by
a
representative
of
the
free
of
course
you
know
eunice
the
newspaper
people
are
on
the
square
why
there
d
be
no
sense
to
the
whole
thing
otherwise
i
saw
an
exhibition
once
you
were
a
little
girl
then
i
remember
you
flew
into
such
a
rage
because
you
couldn
t
go
well
where
was
i
let
me
see
oh
yes
hanlon
h
m
h
m
why
my
goodness
it
s
how
i
do
want
to
go
do
you
suppose
sanford
would
take
us
i
do
not
unless
he
loses
his
mind
first
aunt
abby
you
re
crazy
what
is
the
thing
anyway
some
common
street
show
if
you
d
listen
eunice
and
pay
a
little
attention
you
might
know
what
i
m
talking
about
but
as
soon
as
i
say
telepathy
you
begin
to
laugh
and
make
fun
of
it
all
i
haven
t
heard
anything
yet
to
make
fun
of
what
s
it
all
about
but
as
she
spoke
eunice
embury
was
moving
about
the
room
the
big
of
their
park
avenue
apartment
and
in
a
preoccupied
way
was
patting
her
household
gods
on
their
shoulders
a
readjustment
of
the
pink
carnations
in
a
tall
glass
vase
a
turning
round
of
a
rose
in
a
silver
holder
a
punch
here
and
there
to
the
pillows
of
the
davenport
and
at
last
dropping
down
on
her
desk
chair
as
a
hovering
butterfly
settles
on
a
chosen
flower
a
moment
more
and
she
was
engrossed
in
some
letters
and
aunt
abby
sighed
resignedly
quite
hopeless
now
of
interesting
her
niece
in
her
project
all
the
same
i
m
going
she
remarked
nodding
her
head
at
the
back
of
the
graceful
figure
sitting
at
the
desk
newark
isn
t
so
far
away
i
could
go
alone
or
maybe
take
maggie
she
d
love
it
start
from
the
oberon
theatre
at
h
m
i
could
have
an
early
lunch
and
hidden
in
any
part
of
the
city
only
mentally
directed
not
a
word
spoken
just
think
of
that
eunice
it
doesn
t
seem
credible
that
oh
my
goodness
tomorrow
is
red
cross
day
well
i
can
t
help
it
such
a
chance
as
this
doesn
t
happen
twice
i
wish
i
could
coax
sanford
you
can
t
murmured
eunice
without
looking
up
from
her
writing
then
i
ll
go
alone
aunt
abby
spoke
with
spirit
and
her
bright
black
eyes
snapped
with
determination
as
she
nodded
her
white
head
you
can
t
monopolize
the
willpower
of
the
whole
family
eunice
embury
i
don
t
want
to
but
i
can
have
a
voice
in
the
matters
of
my
own
house
and
family
yes
and
guests
i
can
t
spare
maggie
you
well
know
sanford
won
t
go
on
any
such
wild
goose
chase
with
you
and
i
m
sure
i
won
t
you
can
t
go
alone
and
anyway
the
whole
thing
is
bosh
and
nonsense
let
me
hear
no
more
of
it
eunice
picked
up
her
pen
but
she
cast
a
sidelong
glance
at
her
aunt
to
see
if
she
accepted
the
situation
she
did
not
miss
abby
ames
was
a
lady
of
decision
and
she
had
one
hobby
for
the
pursuit
of
which
she
would
attempt
to
overcome
any
obstacle
you
needn
t
hear
any
more
of
it
eunice
she
said
curtly
i
am
not
a
child
to
be
allowed
out
or
kept
at
home
i
shall
go
to
newark
to
see
this
performance
and
i
shall
go
alone
and
you
ll
do
nothing
of
the
sort
you
d
look
nice
starting
off
alone
on
a
railroad
trip
why
i
don
t
believe
you
ve
ever
been
to
newark
in
your
life
nobody
has
it
isn
t
done
eunice
was
half
whimsical
half
angry
but
her
stormy
eyes
presaged
combat
and
her
rising
color
indicated
decided
annoyance
done
cried
her
aunt
conventions
mean
nothing
to
me
abby
ames
makes
social
laws
she
does
not
obey
those
made
by
others
you
can
t
do
that
in
new
york
aunt
abby
in
your
old
boston
perhaps
you
had
a
certain
dictatorship
but
it
won
t
do
here
moreover
i
have
rights
as
your
hostess
and
i
forbid
you
to
go
skylarking
about
by
you
amuse
me
eunice
i
had
no
intention
of
being
funny
i
assure
while
not
distinctly
humorous
the
idea
of
your
forbidding
me
is
well
oh
my
gracious
eunice
listen
to
this
the
man
chosen
for
hanlon
s
guide
is
the
hon
james
mortimer
h
m
high
street
why
eunice
i
ve
heard
of
mortimer
he
s
i
don
t
care
who
he
is
aunt
abby
and
i
wish
you
d
drop
the
i
won
t
drop
it
it
s
too
interesting
oh
my
i
wish
we
could
go
out
there
in
the
big
car
then
we
could
follow
him
round
hush
go
out
to
newark
in
the
car
trail
round
the
streets
and
alleys
after
a
fool
mountebank
with
a
horde
of
gamins
and
low
horrid
men
crowding
about
they
won
t
be
allowed
to
crowd
about
and
yelling
i
admit
the
yelling
aunt
abby
you
re
impossible
eunice
rose
and
scowled
irately
at
her
aunt
her
temper
always
quick
was
at
times
ungovernable
and
was
oftenest
roused
at
the
suggestion
of
any
topic
or
proceeding
that
jarred
on
her
taste
exclusive
to
the
point
of
absurdity
fastidious
in
all
her
ways
embury
was
so
far
as
possible
in
the
world
but
not
of
it
both
she
and
her
husband
rejoiced
in
the
smallness
of
their
friendly
circle
and
shrank
from
any
unnecessary
association
with
hoi
polloi
and
aunt
abby
ames
their
not
entirely
welcome
guest
was
of
a
different
nature
and
possessed
of
another
scale
of
standards
secure
in
her
new
england
aristocracy
calmly
conscious
of
her
innate
refinement
she
permitted
herself
any
lapses
from
conventional
laws
that
recommended
themselves
to
her
inclination
and
it
can
not
be
denied
that
the
investigation
of
her
pet
subject
the
satisfaction
of
her
curiosity
concerning
occult
matters
and
her
diligent
inquiries
into
the
mysteries
of
the
supernatural
did
lead
her
into
places
and
scenes
not
at
all
in
harmony
with
eunice
s
ideas
of
propriety
not
another
word
of
that
rubbish
auntie
the
subject
is
taboo
and
eunice
waved
her
hand
with
the
air
of
one
who
dismisses
a
matter
completely
don
t
you
think
you
can
come
any
of
your
high
and
mighty
airs
on
me
retorted
the
elder
lady
it
doesn
t
seem
so
very
many
years
ago
that
i
spanked
you
and
shut
you
in
the
closet
for
impudence
the
fact
that
you
are
now
sanford
embury
instead
of
little
eunice
ames
hasn
t
changed
my
attitude
toward
you
oh
auntie
you
are
too
ridiculous
and
eunice
laughed
outright
but
the
tables
are
turned
and
i
am
not
only
sanford
embury
but
your
hostess
and
as
such
entitled
to
your
polite
regard
for
my
tomfoolery
talk
my
dear
i
ll
give
you
all
the
polite
regard
you
are
entitled
to
but
i
shall
carry
out
my
own
wishes
even
though
they
run
contrary
to
yours
and
i
prance
out
to
newark
your
orders
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
the
aristocratic
old
head
went
up
and
the
aristocratic
old
nose
sniffed
disdainfully
for
though
eunice
embury
was
her
aunt
was
equally
so
and
in
a
clash
of
opinions
miss
ames
not
infrequently
won
out
eunice
didn
t
sulk
that
was
not
her
nature
she
turned
back
to
her
writing
desk
with
an
offended
air
but
with
a
smile
as
of
one
who
tolerates
the
vagaries
of
an
inferior
this
she
knew
would
irritate
her
aunt
more
than
further
words
could
do
and
yet
eunice
embury
was
neither
mean
nor
spiteful
of
disposition
she
had
a
furious
temper
but
she
tried
hard
to
control
it
and
when
it
did
break
loose
the
spasm
was
but
of
short
duration
and
she
was
sorry
for
it
afterward
her
husband
declared
he
had
tamed
her
and
that
since
her
marriage
about
two
years
ago
his
wise
calm
influence
had
curbed
her
tendency
to
fly
into
a
rage
and
had
made
her
far
more
equable
and
placid
of
disposition
his
methods
had
been
drastic
somewhat
like
those
of
petruchio
toward
katherine
when
his
wife
grew
angry
sanford
embury
grew
more
so
and
by
harder
words
and
more
scathing
sarcasms
he
as
he
expressed
it
took
the
wind
out
of
her
sails
and
rendered
her
helplessly
vanquished
and
yet
they
were
a
congenial
pair
their
tastes
were
similar
they
liked
the
same
people
the
same
books
the
same
plays
eunice
approved
of
sanford
s
correct
ways
and
perfect
intuitions
and
he
admired
her
beauty
and
dainty
grace
neither
of
them
loved
aunt
abby
the
sister
of
eunice
s
father
but
her
annual
visit
was
customary
and
unavoidable
the
city
apartment
of
the
sanfords
had
no
guestroom
and
therefore
the
visitor
must
needs
occupy
eunice
s
charming
boudoir
and
as
a
bedroom
this
inconvenienced
the
emburys
but
they
put
up
with
it
perforce
nor
would
they
have
so
disliked
to
entertain
the
old
lady
had
it
not
been
for
her
predilection
for
occult
matters
her
visit
to
their
home
coincided
with
her
course
of
clairvoyant
sittings
and
her
class
of
psychic
development
these
took
place
at
houses
in
undesirable
sometimes
unsavory
localities
and
only
aunt
abby
s
immovable
determination
made
it
possible
for
her
to
attend
a
large
the
voice
of
the
future
was
her
inseparable
companion
and
one
of
her
chief
though
as
yet
unfulfilled
desires
was
to
have
a
reading
given
at
the
embury
home
by
the
swami
ramananda
eunice
by
dint
of
stern
disapproval
and
sanford
by
his
chaffing
and
ridicule
had
so
far
prevented
this
calamity
but
both
feared
that
aunt
abby
might
yet
outwit
them
and
have
her
coveted
s√©ance
after
all
outside
of
this
phase
of
her
character
miss
ames
was
not
an
undesirable
guest
she
had
a
good
sense
of
humor
a
kind
and
generous
heart
and
was
both
perceptive
and
responsive
in
matters
of
household
interest
owing
to
the
early
death
of
eunice
s
mother
aunt
abby
had
brought
up
the
child
and
had
done
her
duty
by
her
as
she
saw
it
it
was
after
eunice
had
married
that
miss
ames
became
interested
in
mystics
and
with
a
few
of
her
friends
in
boston
had
formed
a
circle
for
the
pursuance
of
the
cult
her
life
had
otherwise
been
empty
indeed
for
the
girl
had
given
her
occupation
and
that
removed
miss
abby
felt
a
vague
want
of
interest
eunice
ames
had
not
been
easy
to
manage
nor
was
miss
abby
ames
the
best
one
to
be
her
manager
the
girl
was
headstrong
and
wilful
yet
possessed
of
such
winsome
persuasive
wiles
that
she
twisted
her
aunt
round
her
finger
then
too
her
quick
temper
served
as
a
rod
and
many
times
miss
ames
indulged
the
girl
against
her
better
judgment
lest
an
unpleasant
explosion
of
wrath
should
occur
and
shake
her
nervous
system
to
its
foundation
so
eunice
grew
up
an
uncurbed
untamed
and
girl
making
up
her
quarrels
as
fast
as
she
picked
them
and
winning
friends
everywhere
in
spite
of
her
sharp
tongue
and
so
on
this
occasion
neither
of
the
combatants
held
rancor
more
than
a
few
minutes
eunice
went
on
writing
letters
and
miss
abby
went
on
reading
her
paper
until
at
five
o
clock
ferdinand
the
butler
brought
in
the
goody
cried
eunice
jumping
up
i
do
want
some
tea
don
t
you
aunty
yes
and
miss
ames
crossed
the
room
to
sit
beside
her
and
i
ve
an
idea
eunice
i
ll
take
ferdinand
with
me
the
butler
who
was
also
embury
s
valet
and
a
general
household
steward
looked
up
quickly
he
had
been
in
miss
ames
employ
for
many
years
before
eunice
s
marriage
and
now
in
the
embury
s
city
home
was
the
indispensable
of
the
establishment
yes
went
on
aunt
abby
that
will
make
it
all
quite
circumspect
and
correct
ferdinand
tomorrow
you
accompany
me
to
newark
new
i
think
not
said
eunice
quietly
and
dismissing
ferdinand
with
a
nod
she
began
serenely
to
make
the
tea
don
t
be
silly
aunt
abby
she
said
you
can
t
go
that
way
it
would
be
all
right
to
go
with
ferdinand
of
course
but
what
could
you
do
when
you
reached
newark
race
about
on
foot
following
up
this
clown
or
whoever
is
performing
we
could
take
a
taxicab
you
might
get
one
and
you
might
not
now
you
will
wait
till
san
comes
home
and
see
if
he
ll
let
you
have
the
big
will
you
go
then
eunice
no
of
course
not
i
don
t
go
to
such
fool
shows
there
s
the
door
sanford
s
a
step
was
heard
in
the
hall
a
cheery
voice
spoke
to
ferdinand
as
he
took
his
master
s
coat
and
hat
and
then
a
big
man
entered
the
hello
girls
he
said
gaily
how
s
things
he
kissed
eunice
shook
aunt
abby
s
hand
and
dropped
into
an
easy
chair
things
are
whizzing
he
said
as
he
took
the
cup
eunice
poured
for
him
i
ve
just
come
from
the
club
and
our
outlook
is
old
hendricks
is
going
to
get
badly
it
s
all
safe
for
you
then
is
it
and
eunice
smiled
radiantly
at
her
husband
right
as
rain
the
did
it
they
upset
old
hendrick
s
and
spilled
his
beans
lots
of
them
object
to
the
fights
because
of
the
expense
fighters
are
a
bunch
but
i
m
down
on
them
because
i
think
it
bad
form
i
should
say
so
put
in
eunice
emphatically
bad
form
for
an
athletic
club
of
gentlemen
to
have
brutal
exhibitions
for
their
and
what
about
the
theatre
the
same
there
frightful
expense
and
also
rotten
taste
no
the
metropolitan
athletic
club
can
t
stoop
to
such
entertainments
if
it
were
a
little
playhouse
now
and
if
they
had
a
high
class
of
performances
that
would
be
another
story
hey
aunt
abby
what
do
you
think
i
don
t
know
sanford
you
know
i
m
ignorant
on
such
matters
but
i
want
to
ask
you
something
have
you
read
the
paper
why
yes
being
a
normal
american
citizen
i
did
run
through
the
of
freedom
why
did
you
read
about
hanlon
the
great
hanlon
musician
statesman
or
criminal
i
can
t
seem
to
place
a
really
great
hanlon
by
the
way
eunice
if
hendricks
blows
in
ask
him
to
stay
to
dinner
will
you
i
want
to
talk
to
him
but
i
don
t
want
to
seem
unduly
anxious
for
his
very
well
and
eunice
smiled
if
i
can
persuade
him
i
if
you
can
exclaimed
miss
abby
her
sarcasm
entirely
unveiled
alvord
hendricks
would
walk
the
plank
if
you
invited
him
to
do
so
who
wouldn
t
laughed
embury
i
have
the
same
confidence
in
my
wife
s
powers
of
persuasion
that
you
seem
to
have
aunt
abby
and
though
i
may
impose
on
her
i
do
want
her
to
use
them
upon
me
deadly
you
mean
rival
in
your
club
election
returned
miss
ames
but
he
is
also
your
rival
in
another
don
t
speak
so
cryptically
aunt
dear
we
all
know
of
his
infatuation
for
eunice
but
he
s
only
one
of
many
think
you
he
is
more
dangerous
than
say
friend
elliott
mason
elliott
oh
of
course
he
has
been
an
admirer
of
eunice
since
they
made
that
s
two
then
embury
laughed
lightly
and
jim
craft
is
three
and
halliwell
james
is
four
and
guy
little
oh
don
t
include
him
i
beg
of
you
cried
eunice
he
flats
when
he
sings
well
i
could
round
up
a
round
dozen
who
would
willingly
cast
sheeps
eyes
at
my
wife
but
well
they
don
t
they
d
better
not
laughed
eunice
and
embury
added
not
if
i
see
them
first
isn
t
it
funny
said
aunt
abby
reminiscently
that
eunice
did
choose
you
out
of
that
cambridge
i
chose
her
corrected
embury
and
don
t
take
that
wrong
i
mean
that
i
swooped
down
and
carried
her
off
under
their
very
noses
didn
t
i
firebrand
the
only
way
you
could
get
me
agreed
eunice
saucily
oh
i
don
t
know
and
embury
smiled
you
weren
t
so
desperately
no
but
she
was
undecided
said
aunt
abby
why
for
weeks
before
your
engagement
was
announced
eunice
couldn
t
make
up
her
mind
for
certain
there
was
mason
elliott
and
al
hendricks
both
as
determined
as
you
i
know
it
aunt
good
lord
i
guess
i
knew
those
boys
all
my
life
and
i
knew
all
their
love
affairs
as
well
as
they
knew
all
you
had
others
then
and
eunice
opened
her
brown
eyes
in
mock
amazement
rather
how
could
i
know
you
were
the
dearest
girl
in
the
world
if
i
had
no
one
to
compare
you
with
well
then
i
had
a
right
to
have
other
of
course
you
did
i
never
objected
but
now
you
re
my
wife
and
though
all
the
men
in
christendom
may
admire
you
you
are
not
to
give
one
of
them
a
glance
that
belongs
to
no
sir
i
won
t
and
eunice
s
long
lashes
dropped
on
her
cheeks
as
she
assumed
an
absurdly
overdone
meekness
i
was
surprised
though
pursued
aunt
abby
still
reminiscent
when
eunice
married
you
sanford
mason
is
so
much
more
intellectual
and
hendricks
so
much
better
thank
you
lady
and
embury
bowed
gravely
but
you
see
i
have
that
er
indescribable
charm
that
nobody
can
you
have
you
rascal
and
miss
ames
beamed
on
him
and
i
think
this
a
favorable
moment
to
ask
a
favor
of
your
royal
out
with
it
i
ll
grant
it
to
the
half
of
my
kingdom
but
don
t
dip
into
the
other
well
it
s
a
simple
little
favor
after
all
i
want
to
go
out
to
newark

the
big
car

and
he

t
see
a
thing
and
he
doesn
t
know
anybody
and
the
guide
man

mortimer
don
t
you
remember
his
mother
used
to
live
in
cambridge
she
was
an
emmins
well
anyway
it
s
the
most
marvelous
exhibition
of
thought
transference

that

ever
been
shown
and
i
must
go
do
let
me
please
sanford
my
lord
aunt
abby
you

hanlon

abby
but
wait
till

eunice
something
you

dear
if
hendricks
does
show
up
i
can
pump
him
judiciously
and

out
where
the
meredith
brothers

then
all
right
san
i
ll
see
that
he
stays
now
do
settle
aunt
abby
on
this
crazy
scheme
of
hers
she
doesn
t
want
to
go
to
newark
at
all
i
do
i
do
cried
the
old
lady
between
you
and
me
eunice
i
believe
she
does
want
to
go
and
embury
chuckled
where
s
the
paper
aunt
let
me
see
what
it
s
all
a
fair
test
he
read
aloud
positive
evidence
for
or
against
the
theory
of
thought
transference
the
mysterious
hanlon
to
perform
a
seeming
miracle
sponsored
by
the
editor
of
the
newark
free
press
assisted
by
the
prominent
citizen
james
mortimer
done
in
broad
daylight
in
the
sight
of
crowds
of
people
tomorrow
s
performance
will
be
a
revelation
to
doubters
or
a
triumph
indeed
for
those
who
believe
in
h
m
h
m
but
what
s
he
going
to
do
read
on
read
on
sanford
cried
aunt
abby
excitedly
starting
from
the
oberon
theatre
at
two
o
clock
hanlon
will
undertake
to
find
a
penknife
previously
hidden
in
a
distant
part
of
the
city
its
whereabouts
known
only
to
the
editor
of
the
free
press
and
to
mortimer
hanlon
is
to
be
blindfolded
by
a
committee
of
citizens
and
is
to
be
followed
not
preceded
by
mortimer
who
is
to
will
hanlon
in
the
right
direction
and
to
guide
him
merely
by
mental
there
is
to
be
no
word
spoken
between
these
two
men
no
personal
contact
and
no
possibility
of
a
confederate
or
trickery
of
any
sort
mr
mortimer
is
not
a
psychic
indeed
he
is
not
a
student
of
the
occult
or
even
a
believer
in
telepathy
but
he
has
promised
to
obey
the
conditions
laid
down
for
him
these
are
merely
and
only
that
he
is
to
follow
hanlon
keeping
a
few
steps
behind
him
and
mentally
will
the
blindfolded
man
to
go
in
the
right
direction
to
find
the
hidden
isn
t
it
wonderful
sanford
breathed
miss
abby
her
eyes
shining
with
the
delight
of
the
mystery
poppycock
and
embury
smiled
at
her
as
a
gullible
child
you
don
t
mean
to
say
aunt
that
you
believe
there
is
no
trickery
about
this
but
how
can
there
be
you
know
sanford
it
s
easy
enough
to
say
poppycock
and
and
gammon
and
spinach
but
just
tell
me
how
it
s
done
how
it
can
be
done
by
trickery
suggest
a
means
however
complicated
or
difficult
oh
of
course
i
can
t
i
m
no
charlatan
or
prestidigitateur
but
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
the
thing
is
a
trick
i
don
t
and
anyway
that
isn
t
the
point
i
want
to
go
to
see
it
i
m
not
asking
your
opinion
of
the
performance
i
m
asking
you
to
let
me
go
may
i
no
indeed
why
aunt
abby
it
will
be
a
terrible
crowd
a
horde
of
ragamuffins
and
ruffians
you
d
be
torn
to
pieces
but
i
want
to
sanford
and
the
old
lady
was
on
the
verge
of
tears
i
want
to
see
hanlon
hanlon
who
wants
to
see
hanlon
the
expected
hendricks
came
into
the
room
and
shaking
hands
as
he
talked
he
repeated
his
question
who
wants
to
see
hanlon
because
i
do
and
i
ll
take
any
one
here
who
is
oh
you
angel
man
exclaimed
aunt
abby
her
face
beaming
i
want
to
go
will
you
really
take
me
alvord
sure
i
will
anybody
else
you
want
to
see
it
eunice
why
i
didn
t
but
as
sanford
just
read
it
it
sounded
interesting
how
would
we
go
i
ll
run
you
out
in
my
touring
car
it
won
t
take
more
n
the
afternoon
and
it
ll
be
a
jolly
picnic
go
along
san
no
not
on
your
life
when
did
you
go
foolish
alvord
oh
i
always
had
a
notion
toward
that
sort
of
thing
i
want
to
see
how
he
does
it
don
t
think
i
fall
for
the
telepathy
gag
but
i
want
to
see
where
the
little
joker
is
and
then
too
i
m
glad
to
please
the
i
ll
go
said
eunice
that
is
if
you
ll
stay
and
dine
now
and
we
can
talk
it
over
and
plan
the
with
all
the
pleasure
in
life
returned
hendricks
chapter
ii
a
trip
to
newark
perhaps
no
factor
is
more
indicative
of
the
type
of
a
home
life
than
its
breakfast
atmosphere
for
in
america
it
is
only
a
small
proportion
even
among
the
wealthy
who
breakfast
in
their
and
a
knowledge
of
the
appointments
and
customs
of
the
breakfast
are
often
data
enough
to
stamp
the
status
of
the
household
in
the
embury
home
breakfast
was
a
pleasant
for
the
day
both
sanford
and
eunice
were
of
the
sort
who
wake
up
and
their
appearance
in
the
was
always
an
occasion
of
merry
banter
and
a
leisurely
enjoyment
of
the
meal
aunt
abby
too
was
at
her
best
in
the
morning
and
breakfast
was
served
sufficiently
early
to
do
away
with
any
need
for
hurry
on
sanford
s
part
the
morning
paper
save
for
its
headlines
was
not
a
component
part
of
the
routine
and
it
was
an
exceptionally
interesting
topic
that
caused
it
to
be
unfolded
this
morning
however
miss
ames
reached
the
before
the
others
and
eagerly
scanned
the
pages
for
some
further
notes
of
the
affair
in
newark
but
with
the
total
depravity
of
inanimate
things
and
with
the
invariable
disappointingness
of
a
newspaper
the
columns
offered
no
other
information
than
a
mere
announcement
of
the
coming
event
hunting
for
details
of
your
chase
asked
embury
as
he
paused
on
the
way
to
his
own
chair
to
lean
over
aunt
abby
s
shoulder
yes
and
there
s
almost
nothing
why
do
you
take
this
paper
you
ll
see
it
all
so
why
do
you
want
to
read
about
it
laughed
a
gay
voice
and
eunice
came
in
all
fluttering
chiffon
and
ribbon
ends
she
took
the
chair
ferdinand
placed
for
her
and
picked
up
a
spoon
as
the
attentive
man
set
grapefruit
at
her
plate
the
waitress
was
allowed
to
serve
the
others
but
ferdinand
reserved
to
himself
the
privilege
of
waiting
on
his
beloved
mistress
still
of
a
mind
to
go
she
said
smiling
at
her
aunt
more
than
ever
it
s
a
perfectly
heavenly
day
and
we
ll
have
a
good
ride
if
nothing
good
ride
chaffed
embury
don
t
you
fool
yourself
aunt
abby
the
ride
from
this
burg
to
newark
is
just
about
the
most
godforsaken
bit
of
scenery
you
ever
passed
through
i
don
t
mind
that
al
hendricks
is
good
company
and
any
way
i
d
go
through
fire
and
water
to
see
that
hanlon
show
eunice
can
t
you
and
hendricks
pick
me
up
i
want
to
go
to
my
psychic
class
this
morning
and
there
s
no
use
coming
way
back
here
yes
certainly
we
re
going
about
noon
you
know
and
have
lunch
in
in
newark
and
embury
looked
his
amazement
yes
alvord
said
so
last
night
he
says
that
new
hotel
there
is
quite
all
right
we
ll
only
have
time
for
a
bite
well
bite
where
you
like
by
the
way
my
tiger
girl
you
didn
t
get
that
information
from
our
friend
last
no
san
i
couldn
t
without
making
it
too
pointed
i
thought
i
could
bring
it
in
more
casually
say
at
yes
that
s
good
but
find
out
eunice
just
where
the
merediths
stand
they
may
swing
the
whole
what
vote
asked
aunt
abby
who
was
interested
in
everything
our
club
auntie
and
embury
explained
you
know
hendricks
is
president
has
been
for
years
and
we
re
trying
to
oust
him
in
favor
of
yours
you
sanford
do
you
mean
you
want
to
put
him
out
and
put
yourself
in
his
place
exactly
that
my
queer
does
he
know
it
rather
yes
even
on
calm
second
thought
i
should
say
hendricks
knows
it
but
i
shouldn
t
think
you
two
would
be
friends
in
such
that
s
the
beauty
of
it
ma
am
we
re
bosom
friends
as
you
know
and
yet
we
re
fighting
for
that
presidency
like
two
cats
of
the
new
york
athletic
club
is
it
oh
no
ma
am
not
so
but
far
otherwise
the
metropolitan
athletic
club
if
you
yes
i
know
i
d
forgotten
the
don
t
mix
up
the
two
they
re
deadly
why
do
you
want
to
be
president
sanford
that
s
a
long
tale
but
in
a
nutshell
purely
and
solely
for
the
good
of
the
and
that
s
the
truth
declared
eunice
sanford
is
getting
himself
disliked
in
some
quarters
influential
ones
too
and
he
s
making
enemies
not
alvord
but
others
and
it
is
all
because
he
has
the
real
interests
of
the
club
at
heart
al
hendricks
is
running
it
into
into
a
isn
t
he
san
well
yes
though
i
shouldn
t
have
thought
of
using
that
word
but
he
is
bringing
its
gray
hairs
in
sorrow
to
the
grave
or
will
if
he
remains
in
office
instead
of
turning
it
over
to
a
man
of
good
judgment
and
unerring
taste
say
like
one
sanford
you
certainly
are
not
afflicted
with
false
pride
sanford
and
aunt
abby
bit
into
her
crisp
toast
with
a
decided
snap
why
thank
you
and
embury
smiled
as
he
purposely
misinterpreted
her
words
i
quite
agree
aunt
that
my
pride
is
by
no
means
false
it
is
a
just
and
righteous
pride
in
my
own
merits
both
natural
and
he
winked
at
eunice
across
the
table
and
she
smiled
back
appreciatively
aunt
abby
gave
him
what
was
meant
to
be
a
scathing
glance
but
which
turned
to
a
nod
of
admiration
that
s
so
sanford
she
admitted
al
hendricks
is
a
nice
man
but
he
falls
down
on
some
things
hasn
t
he
been
a
good
president
until
lately
aunt
abby
now
he
s
all
mixed
up
with
a
crowd
of
intractables
sporty
chaps
who
want
a
lot
of
innovations
that
the
more
conservative
element
won
t
stand
why
they
want
and
a
movie
in
the
club
informed
eunice
and
it
means
too
much
expense
besides
being
a
horrid
there
there
tiger
and
sanford
shook
his
head
at
her
let
us
say
those
things
are
unpalatable
to
a
lot
of
us
old
fogies
stop
i
won
t
have
you
call
yourself
old
or
fogyish
either
you
re
the
farthest
possible
removed
from
that
why
you
re
no
older
than
al
you
were
all
children
together
said
aunt
abby
as
if
imparting
a
bit
of
new
information
you
three
and
mason
elliott
why
when
you
were
ten
or
eleven
eunice
those
three
boys
were
eternally
camping
out
in
the
front
yard
waiting
for
you
to
get
your
hair
curled
and
go
out
to
play
and
later
they
all
hung
around
to
take
you
to
parties
and
then
later
still
not
so
much
later
either
they
all
wanted
to
marry
why
auntie
you
re
telling
the
whole
story
of
my
life
and
what
s
my
real
name
sanford
knows
all
this
and
knows
that
he
cut
out
the
other
two
though
i
m
not
saying
they
wanted
to
marry
it
goes
without
saying
and
her
husband
gave
her
a
gallant
bow
but
great
heavens
eunice
if
you
d
married
those
other
two
i
mean
one
of
em
either
one
you
d
have
been
decidedly
out
of
your
element
hendricks
though
a
bully
chap
is
a
man
of
impossible
tastes
and
elliott
is
a
prig
pure
and
simple
i
you
see
strike
a
happy
medium
and
speaking
of
such
things
are
your
mediums
always
happy
aunt
abby
how
you
do
rattle
on
sanford
a
true
medium
is
so
absorbed
in
her
endeavors
so
wrapped
up
in
her
work
she
is
of
course
happy
i
suppose
i
never
thought
about
well
don
t
go
out
of
your
way
to
find
out
it
isn
t
of
vital
importance
that
i
should
know
may
i
be
excused
madam
wife
i
m
called
to
the
busy
marts
and
all
that
sort
of
embury
rose
from
the
table
a
big
tall
man
graceful
in
his
every
motion
as
only
a
trained
athlete
can
be
devoted
to
athletics
he
kept
himself
in
the
pink
of
condition
physically
and
this
was
no
small
aid
to
his
vigorous
mentality
and
splendid
business
acumen
wait
a
minute
san
and
for
the
first
time
that
morning
there
was
a
note
of
timidity
in
eunice
s
soft
voice
please
give
me
a
little
money
won
t
you
money
you
grasping
young
person
what
do
you
want
it
for
why
i
m
going
to
newark
you
know
going
to
newark
yes
but
you
re
going
in
hendricks
car
that
doesn
t
require
a
ticket
does
it
no
but
i
i
might
want
to
give
the
chauffeur
something
when
i
get
out
nonsense
not
hendricks
chauffeur
that
s
all
right
when
you
re
with
formal
friends
or
comparative
strangers
but
it
would
be
ridiculous
to
tip
hendricks
gus
embury
swung
into
the
light
topcoat
held
by
the
faithful
ferdinand
but
dear
and
eunice
rose
and
stood
by
her
husband
i
do
want
a
little
money
she
fingered
nervously
the
breakfast
napkin
she
was
still
holding
what
for
was
the
repeated
inquiry
oh
you
see
i
might
want
to
do
a
little
shopping
in
shop
in
newark
that
s
a
good
one
why
girlie
you
never
want
to
shop
outside
of
little
old
new
york
and
you
know
it
shop
in
newark
embury
laughed
at
the
very
idea
but
i
might
see
something
in
a
window
that
s
just
what
i
then
make
a
note
of
it
and
buy
it
in
new
york
you
have
an
account
at
all
the
desirable
shops
here
and
i
never
kick
at
the
bills
do
i
now
no
but
a
woman
does
want
a
little
cash
with
her
oh
that
of
course
i
quite
subscribe
to
that
but
i
gave
you
a
couple
of
dollars
yes
but
i
gave
one
to
a
red
cross
collector
and
the
other
i
had
to
pay
out
for
a
why
buy
things
when
you
have
accounts
everywhere
oh
this
was
something
i
saw
advertised
in
the
evening
paper
and
you
bought
it
because
it
was
cheap
oh
you
women
now
eunice
that
s
just
a
case
in
point
i
want
my
wife
to
have
everything
she
wants
everything
in
reason
but
there
s
no
sense
in
throwing
money
away
now
kiss
me
sweetheart
for
i
m
due
at
a
directors
meeting
in
two
shakes
or
embury
snapped
the
fastening
of
his
second
glove
and
hat
in
hand
held
out
his
arms
to
his
wife
she
made
one
more
appeal
you
re
quite
right
san
maybe
i
didn
t
need
that
thing
but
i
do
want
a
little
chickenfeed
in
my
purse
when
i
go
out
maybe
they
ll
take
up
a
a
silver
offering
for
the
old
ladies
home
eh
well
tell
em
to
come
to
me
and
i
ll
sign
their
subscription
paper
now
dolly
gray
i
m
off
with
a
hearty
kiss
on
eunice
s
red
lips
and
a
gay
wave
of
his
hand
to
aunt
abby
embury
went
away
and
ferdinand
closed
the
door
behind
him
i
can
t
stand
it
aunt
abby
eunice
exclaimed
as
the
butler
disappeared
into
the
pantry
if
sanford
were
a
poor
man
it
would
be
different
but
he
s
made
more
money
this
year
than
ever
before
and
yet
he
won
t
give
me
an
allowance
or
even
a
little
bit
of
ready
but
you
have
accounts
aunt
abby
said
absently
for
scanning
the
paper
now
accounts
of
course
i
have
but
there
are
a
thousand
things
one
wants
cash
for
you
know
that
perfectly
well
why
when
our
car
was
out
of
commission
last
week
and
i
had
to
use
a
taxicab
sanford
would
give
me
just
enough
for
the
fare
and
not
a
cent
over
to
fee
the
driver
and
lots
of
times
i
need
a
few
dollars
for
charities
or
some
odds
and
ends
and
i
can
t
have
a
cent
to
call
my
own
al
hendricks
may
be
of
coarser
clay
than
sanford
embury
but
he
wouldn
treat
a
wife
like
that
it
is
annoying
eunice
but
sanford
is
so
good
to
you
good
to
me
why
shouldn
t
he
be
it
isn
t
a
question
of
goodness
or
of
generosity
it
s
just
a
fool
whim
of
his
that
i
mustn
t
ask
for
actual
cash
i
can
have
all
the
parties
i
want
buy
all
the
clothes
i
want
get
expensive
hats
or
of
any
sort
and
have
them
all
charged
he
s
never
even
questioned
my
bills
but
has
his
secretary
pay
them
and
i
must
have
some
money
in
my
purse
and
i
will
i
know
ways
to
get
it
without
begging
it
from
sanford
embury
eunice
s
dark
eyes
flashed
fire
and
her
cheeks
burned
scarlet
for
she
was
furiously
angry
now
now
my
dear
don
t
take
it
so
to
heart
soothed
aunt
abby
i
ll
give
you
some
money
i
was
going
to
make
you
a
present
but
if
you
d
rather
have
the
money
that
it
would
cost
say
i
daren
t
aunt
abby
sanford
would
find
it
out
and
he
d
be
terribly
annoyed
it
s
one
of
his
idiosyncrasies
and
i
have
to
bear
it
as
long
as
i
live
with
him
the
gleam
in
the
beautiful
eyes
gave
a
hint
of
desperate
remedies
that
might
be
applied
to
the
case
but
ferdinand
returned
to
the
room
and
the
two
women
quickly
spoke
of
other
things
hendricks
perfectly
appointed
and
car
made
the
trip
to
newark
in
minimum
time
though
the
road
was
not
a
picturesque
one
the
party
was
in
gay
spirits
and
the
host
was
indefatigable
in
his
efforts
to
be
entertaining
i
ve
looked
up
this
hanlon
person
he
said
and
his
record
is
astonishing
i
mean
he
does
astonishing
feats
he
s
a
juggler
a
sword
swallower
and
a
card
sharp
that
is
a
card
wizard
of
course
he
s
a
faker
but
he
s
a
clever
one
and
i
m
anxious
to
see
what
his
game
is
this
time
of
course
it
s
first
of
all
advertisement
for
the
paper
that
s
backing
him
but
it
s
a
new
game
at
least
it
s
new
over
here
they
tell
me
it
s
done
to
death
in
oh
no
alvord
it
isn
t
a
game
insisted
miss
ames
if
the
man
is
blindfolded
he
can
t
play
any
tricks
on
us
and
he
couldn
t
play
tricks
on
newspaper
men
anyway
they
re
too
bright
for
that
i
think
they
are
too
that
s
why
i
m
interested
warm
enough
eunice
yes
thank
you
and
the
beautiful
face
looked
happily
content
as
eunice
embury
nestled
her
chin
deeper
into
her
fur
collar
for
though
late
april
the
day
was
crisply
cool
and
there
was
a
tang
in
the
bright
sunshiny
air
aunt
abby
was
almost
as
warmly
wrapped
up
as
in
midwinter
and
when
on
reaching
newark
they
encountered
a
raw
east
wind
she
shrugged
into
her
coat
like
a
shivering
esquimau
where
do
we
go
to
see
it
asked
eunice
as
later
after
luncheon
she
eagerly
looked
about
at
the
crowds
massed
everywhere
we
ll
have
to
reconnoiter
hendricks
replied
smiling
at
her
animated
face
drive
on
to
the
oberon
as
they
neared
the
theatre
the
surging
waves
of
humanity
barred
their
progress
and
the
big
car
was
forced
to
come
to
a
standstill
i
ll
get
out
said
hendricks
and
make
a
few
inquiries
the
free
press
office
is
near
here
and
i
know
some
of
the
people
he
strode
off
and
was
soon
swallowed
up
in
the
crowd
i
think
i
see
a
good
opening
said
gus
after
a
moment

abby
tried
to
extricate
herself
from
the
motor
rug
that
had
been
tucked
all
too
securely
about
her
and
failing
in
that
endeavored
to
reach

her
pocket

her
gloved
hand

hopelessly

mass
of

chiffon

two
men
came
to
the
side
of
the
car
i
made
him
come
and
speak
to
you
ladies
though
i
believe
its
holding
up
the
whole
performance
let
me
present
the
god
in
the
machine
not
that
said
mortimer
smiling
only
a
small
mechanical
part
of
s
doings
i
ve
a
few
minutes
to
spare
though
but
a
few
how
do
you
do
miss
ames
glad
to
see
you
again
and
embury
this
brings
back
childhood
days
tell
me
about
hanlon
begged
miss
ames
is
he
on
the
square
so
far
as
i
know
and
i
know
all
there
is
to
know
i
think
i
was
present
at
a
preliminary
test
this
morning
and
i
ll
tell
you
what
he
mortimer
looked
at
his
watch
and
proceeded
quickly
in
at
the
free
press
office
one
of
the
men
took
a
piece
of
chalk
and
drew
a
line
from
where
we
were
to
a
distant
room
of
the
building
the
line
went
up
and
down
stairs
in
and
out
of
various
rooms
over
chairs
and
under
desks
and
finally
wound
up
in
a
small
closet
in
the
city
editor
s
office
well
and
i
must
jump
away
now
that
wizard
hanlon
being
securely
blindfolded
i
did
it
myself
followed
that
line
almost
without
deviation
from
start
to
finish
through
a
building
he
had
never
seers
before
and
groping
along
in
complete
how
in
the
world
could
he
do
it
aunt
abby
asked
breathlessly
the
chap
who
drew
the
line
was
behind
him
behind
mind
you
and
he
willed
him
where
to
go
of
course
he
did
his
best
kept
his
mind
on
the
job
and
earnestly
used
his
mentality
to
will
hanlon
along
and
did
there
that
s
all
i
know
until
this
afternoon
s
stunt
is
pulled
off
but
what
i
ve
told
you
i
do
know
i
saw
it
and
i
for
one
am
a
complete
convert
to
telepathy
the
busy
man
hastily
shaking
hands
bustled
away
and
hendricks
told
in
glee
how
through
his
acquaintance
with
mortimer
he
had
secured
a
permit
to
drive
his
car
among
the
front
ones
that
were
following
the
performance
which
was
to
begin
very
soon
now
gus
returned
and
they
were
about
to
start
when
aunt
abby
set
up
a
plea
for
a
copy
of
the
paper
that
she
wanted
gus
tried
his
best
hendricks
himself
made
endeavors
but
all
in
vain
the
papers
were
gone
the
edition
exhausted
nor
could
any
one
whom
they
asked
be
induced
to
part
with
his
copy
even
at
a
substantial
premium
sorry
miss
ames
said
hendricks
but
we
can
t
seem
to
nail
one
perhaps
later
we
can
get
one
now
we
must
be
starting
or
we
ll
soon
lose
our
the
crowd
was
like
a
rolling
sea
by
this
time
and
only
the
efficiency
of
the
fine
police
work
kept
anything
like
order
cautiously
the
motor
car
edged
along
while
the
daring
pedestrians
seemed
to
scramble
from
beneath
the
very
wheels
and
then
a
cheer
arose
which
proclaimed
the
presence
of
hanlon
the
mysterious
possessor
of
second
sight
or
the
marvelous
reader
of
another
s
mind
nobody
knew
exactly
which
he
was
chapter
iii
the
stunt
bowing
in
response
to
the
mighty
cheer
that
greeted
his
appearance
hanlon
stood
smiling
at
the
crowd
a
young
fellow
he
seemed
to
be
slender
and
with
a
frank
winning
face
but
he
evidently
meant
business
for
he
turned
at
once
to
mortimer
and
asked
that
the
test
be
begun
a
few
words
from
one
of
the
staff
of
the
newspaper
that
was
backing
the
enterprise
informed
the
audience
that
the
day
before
there
had
been
hidden
in
a
distant
part
of
the
city
a
penknife
and
that
only
the
hider
thereof
and
the
hon
mortimer
knew
where
the
hiding
place
was
hanlon
would
now
undertake
to
go
blindfolded
to
the
spot
and
find
the
knife
although
the
distance
as
the
speaker
was
willing
to
disclose
was
more
than
a
mile
the
blindfolding
was
to
be
done
by
a
committee
of
prominent
citizens
and
was
to
be
looked
after
so
carefully
that
there
could
be
no
possibility
of
hanlon
s
seeing
anything
after
that
hanlon
engaged
to
go
to
the
hiding
place
and
find
the
knife
on
condition
that
mortimer
would
follow
him
and
concentrate
all
his
willpower
on
mentally
guiding
or
rather
directing
hanlon
s
footsteps
the
blindfolding
which
was
done
in
full
view
of
the
front
ranks
of
spectators
was
an
elaborate
proceeding
a
heavy
silk
handkerchief
had
been
prepared
by
folding
it
in
eight
thicknesses
which
were
then
stitched
to
prevent
clipping
this
bandage
was
four
inches
wide
and
completely
covered
the
man
s
eyes
but
as
an
additional
precaution
pads
of
cotton
wool
were
first
placed
over
his
closed
eyelids
and
the
bandage
then
tied
over
them
thus
completely
blindfolded
hanlon
spoke
earnestly
to
mortimer
i
must
ask
of
you
sir
that
you
do
your
very
best
to
guide
me
aright
the
success
of
this
enterprise
depends
quite
as
much
on
you
as
on
myself
i
am
merely
receptive
you
are
the
acting
agent
i
strive
to
keep
my
mind
a
blank
that
your
will
may
sway
it
in
the
right
direction
i
trust
you
and
i
beg
that
you
will
keep
your
whole
mind
on
the
quest
think
of
the
hidden
article
keep
it
in
your
mind
look
toward
it
follow
me
not
too
closely
and
mentally
push
me
in
the
way
i
should
go
if
i
go
wrong
will
me
back
to
the
right
path
but
in
no
case
get
near
enough
to
touch
me
and
of
course
do
not
speak
to
me
this
test
is
entirely
that
of
the
influence
of
your
will
upon
mine
call
it
telepathy
anything
you
choose
but
grant
my
request
that
you
devote
all
your
attention
to
the
work
in
hand
if
your
mind
wanders
mine
will
if
your
mind
goes
straight
to
the
goal
mine
will
also
be
impelled
with
a
slight
bow
hanlon
stood
motionless
ready
to
start
the
preliminaries
had
taken
place
on
a
platform
hastily
built
for
the
occasion
and
now
with
mortimer
behind
him
hanlon
started
down
the
steps
to
the
street
reaching
the
pavement
he
stood
motionless
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
turning
walked
toward
broad
street
reaching
it
he
turned
south
and
walked
along
at
a
fairly
rapid
gait
at
the
crossings
he
paused
momentarily
sometimes
as
if
uncertain
which
way
to
go
and
again
evidently
assured
of
his
direction
the
crowd
surged
about
him
now
impeding
his
progress
and
now
almost
pushing
him
along
he
gave
them
no
heed
but
made
his
way
here
or
there
as
he
chose
and
mortimer
followed
always
a
few
steps
behind
but
near
enough
to
see
that
hanlon
was
in
no
way
interfered
with
by
the
throng
indeed
so
anxious
were
the
onlookers
that
fair
play
should
obtain
the
ones
nearest
to
the
performer
served
as
a
cordon
of
guards
to
keep
his
immediate
surroundings
cleared
hanlon
s
actions
in
all
respects
were
those
that
might
be
expected
from
a
blindfolded
man
he
groped
sometimes
with
outstretched
hands
again
with
arms
folded
or
hands
clasped
and
extended
but
always
with
an
expression
so
far
as
his
face
could
be
seen
of
earnest
concentrated
endeavor
to
go
the
right
way
now
and
then
he
would
half
turn
as
if
impelled
in
one
direction
and
then
hesitate
turn
and
march
off
the
other
way
one
time
indeed
he
went
nearly
half
a
block
in
a
wrong
street
then
he
paused
groped
stumbled
a
little
and
gradually
returned
to
the
vicinity
of
mortimer
who
had
stood
still
at
the
corner
apparently
hanlon
had
no
idea
of
his
detour
for
he
went
on
in
the
right
direction
and
mortimer
who
was
oblivious
to
all
but
his
mission
followed
interestedly
one
time
hanlon
spoke
to
him
you
are
a
fine
guide
sir
he
said
i
seem
impelled
steadily
not
in
sudden
thought
waves
and
i
find
my
mind
responds
well
to
your
will
if
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
keep
the
crowd
away
from
us
a
little
more
carefully
i
don
t
want
you
any
nearer
me
but
if
too
many
people
are
between
us
it
interferes
somewhat
with
the
transference
of
your
guiding
do
you
want
to
hear
my
footsteps
asked
mortimer
thoughtfully
that
doesn
t
matter
hanlon
smiled
you
are
to
follow
me
sir
even
if
i
go
wrong
if
i
waited
to
hear
you
that
would
be
no
test
at
all
simply
will
me
and
then
follow
whether
i
am
on
the
right
track
or
not
but
keep
your
mind
on
the
goal
and
look
toward
it
if
convenient
of
course
the
looking
toward
it
is
no
help
to
me
save
as
it
serves
to
fix
your
mind
more
firmly
on
the
and
then
hanlon
seemed
to
go
more
carefully
he
stepped
slowly
feeling
with
his
foot
for
any
curbstone
grating
or
irregularity
in
the
pavement
and
yet
he
failed
in
one
instance
to
feel
the
edge
of
an
open
coalhole
and
his
right
leg
slipped
down
into
it
some
of
the
nearby
watchers
grabbed
him
and
pulled
him
back
without
his
sustaining
injury
for
which
he
thanked
them
briefly
and
continued
several
times
some
sceptical
bystanders
put
themselves
deliberately
in
front
of
the
blindfolded
man
to
see
if
he
would
turn
out
for
them
on
the
contrary
hanlon
bumped
into
them
so
innocently
that
they
were
nearly
thrown
down
he
smiled
and
said
all
right
fellows
i
don
t
mind
if
you
don
t
and
i
don
t
blame
you
for
wanting
to
make
sure
that
i
m
not
playing
possum
of
course
hanlon
carried
no
light
cane
such
as
blind
men
use
to
tap
on
the
stones
so
he
helped
himself
by
feeling
the
way
along
shop
windows
and
area
gates
judging
thus
when
he
was
nearing
a
cross
street
and
sometimes
hesitating
whether
to
cross
or
turn
the
corner
after
a
of
this
sort
of
progress
he
found
himself
in
a
vacant
lot
near
the
edge
of
the
city
there
had
been
a
building
in
the
middle
of
the
plot
of
ground
but
it
had
been
burned
down
and
only
a
pile
of
blackened
debris
marked
the
place
reaching
the
corner
of
the
streets
that
bounded
the
lot
hanlon
made
no
pause
but
started
on
a
straight
diagonal
toward
the
center
of
the
lot
he
stepped
into
a
tangle
of
charred
logs
and
ashes
but
forged
ahead
unhesitatingly
though
slowly
and
picked
his
way
by
thrusting
the
toe
of
his
shoe
tentatively
forward
mortimer
about
three
paces
behind
him
followed
unheeding
the
rubbish
he
stalked
through
and
very
evidently
absorbed
in
doing
his
part
to
its
conclusion
for
the
knife
was
hidden
in
the
very
center
of
the
house
a
bit
of
flooring
was
left
on
which
hanlon
climbed
mortimer
getting
up
on
it
also
hanlon
walked
slowly
round
in
a
circle
the
floor
being
several
yards
square
mortimer
stepped
behind
him
gravely
looking
toward
the
and
exerting
all
his
mentality
toward
guiding
hanlon
to
it
at
no
time
was
he
nearer
than
two
feet
though
once
making
a
quick
turn
hanlon
nearly
bumped
into
him
finally
hanlon
poking
about
in
the
ashes
with
his
right
foot
kicked
against
something
he
picked
it
up
and
it
proved
to
be
only
a
bit
of
wire
but
the
next
moment
he
struck
something
else
and
stooping
brought
up
triumphantly
the
hidden
penknife
which
he
waved
exultantly
at
the
crowd
loud
and
long
they
cheered
him
cordially
mortimer
grasped
the
hands
of
the
hero
and
it
was
with
some
difficulty
that
alvord
hendricks
restrained
miss
abby
ames
from
getting
out
of
his
car
and
rushing
to
congratulate
the
successful
now
she
exclaimed
no
one
can
ever
doubt
the
fact
of
telepathy
after
this
how
else
could
that
young
man
have
done
what
he
has
done
answer
me
that
it
s
all
a
fake
asserted
hendricks
but
i
m
ready
to
acknowledge
i
don
t
know
how
it
s
done
it
s
the
best
game
i
ever
saw
put
up
and
i
d
like
to
know
how
he
does
seems
to
me
put
in
eunice
a
little
dryly
one
oughtn
t
to
insist
that
it
is
a
fake
unless
one
has
some
notion
at
least
of
how
it
could
be
done
if
the
man
could
see
could
even
peep
there
might
be
a
chance
for
trickery
but
with
those
thick
cotton
pads
on
his
eyes
and
then
covered
with
that
big
thick
folded
silk
handkerchief
it
s
really
a
s
no
chance
for
his
and
if
he
could
see
if
his
eyes
were
wide
open
how
would
he
know
where
to
go
demanded
aunt
abby
that
blindfolding
is
only
so
he
can
t
see
mortimer
s
face
if
he
turns
round
and
judge
from
its
expression
and
also
i
daresay
to
help
him
concentrate
his
mind
and
not
be
diverted
or
distracted
by
the
crowd
and
all
the
same
i
don
t
believe
in
it
and
hendricks
shook
his
head
obstinately
there
is
no
such
thing
as
telepathy
and
this
willing
business
has
all
been
exposed
years
i
remember
and
aunt
abby
nodded
you
mean
that
bishop
man
and
all
that
but
this
affair
it
quite
different
you
don
t
believe
mortimer
was
a
party
to
deceit
do
you
no
i
don
t
mortimer
is
a
judge
and
a
most
honest
man
besides
he
wouldn
t
stoop
to
trickery
in
a
thing
of
this
sort
but
he
has
been
himself
then
how
was
it
done
cried
eunice
triumphantly
for
no
one
else
knew
where
the
knife
was
hidden
except
that
newspaper
man
who
hid
it
and
he
was
sincere
of
course
or
there
d
be
no
sense
in
the
whole
i
know
that
yes
the
newspaper
people
were
hoodwinked
then
what
happened
eunice
persisted
there
s
no
possible
explanation
but
telepathy
is
there
now
i
don
t
know
of
any
hendricks
was
forced
to
admit
after
the
excitement
blows
over
a
little
i
ll
try
to
speak
with
mortimer
again
i
d
like
to
know
his
they
sat
in
the
car
looking
at
the
hilarious
crowds
of
people
most
of
whom
seemed
imbued
with
a
wild
desire
to
get
to
the
hero
of
the
hour
and
demand
his
secret
there
s
a
man
who
looks
like
tom
meredith
said
eunice
suddenly
by
the
way
alvord
where
do
the
merediths
stand
in
the
matter
of
the
club
election
which
of
them
either
or
both
i
suppose
they
re
on
your
side
they
never
seemed
to
like
sanford
my
dear
eunice
don
t
be
so
club
men
don
t
vote
one
way
or
another
because
of
a
personal
like
or
dislike
they
consider
the
good
of
the
club
the
welfare
of
the
well
then
which
side
do
they
favor
as
being
for
the
good
of
the
club
ask
oh
if
you
don
t
want
to
tell
eunice
looked
provokingly
pretty
and
her
piquant
face
showed
a
petulant
expression
as
she
turned
it
to
hendricks
smile
on
me
again
and
i
ll
tell
you
anything
you
want
to
know
if
i
know
it
a
dazzling
smile
answered
this
speech
and
hendricks
gaze
softened
as
he
watched
her
but
you
ll
have
to
ask
me
something
else
for
alas
the
brothers
meredith
haven
t
made
a
confidant
of
and
eunice
s
dark
eyes
assumed
the
look
of
a
roguish
little
girl
you
can
t
fool
me
alvord
now
tell
me
and
i
ll
invite
you
in
to
tea
when
we
get
i
m
going
in
not
unless
you
tell
me
what
i
ask
why
won
t
you
is
it
a
secret
pooh
i
d
just
as
lief
ask
tom
meredith
myself
if
i
could
see
him
never
mind
don
t
tell
me
if
you
don
t
want
to
you
re
not
my
only
confidential
friend
there
are
who
are
they
euny
i
flattered
myself
i
was
your
only
really
truly
intimate
friend
not
even
excepting
your
husband
oh
what
a
naughty
speech
if
you
weren
t
sanford
s
very
good
friend
i
d
never
speak
to
you
again
i
don
t
see
how
you
two
men
can
be
friends
put
in
aunt
abby
when
you
re
both
after
that
same
that
s
the
answer
eunice
laughed
alvord
is
san
s
greatest
friend
because
it
s
going
to
be
an
easy
thing
for
sanford
to
win
the
election
from
him
if
there
were
a
more
popular
candidate
in
alvord
s
place
or
a
less
popular
one
in
sanford
s
place
it
wouldn
t
be
such
a
walkover
you
you
hendricks
looked
at
eunice
in
speechless
admiration
the
dancing
eyes
were
impudent
the
red
lips
curved
scornfully
and
she
made
a
daring
little
moue
at
him
as
she
readjusted
her
black
lace
veil
so
that
a
heavy
bit
of
its
pattern
covered
her
mouth
what
do
you
do
that
for
move
that
darned
flower
so
i
can
see
you
talk
she
laughed
then
and
wrinkled
her
straight
little
nose
until
the
veil
billowed
mischievously
i
wish
you
d
take
that
thing
off
hendricks
said
irritatedly
it
annoys
and
pray
sir
who
are
you
that
i
should
shield
you
from
annoyance
my
veil
is
a
necessary
part
of
my
necessary
nothing
take
it
off
i
tell
you
merry
christmas
and
eunice
gave
him
such
a
scornful
shrug
of
her
furred
shoulders
that
hendricks
laughed
out
in
sheer
enjoyment
of
her
audacity
tell
me
about
the
merediths
and
i
ll
take
off
the
offending
veil
she
urged
looking
at
him
very
coaxingly
all
right
off
with
slowly
and
with
careful
deliberation
eunice
unpinned
her
veil
took
it
off
and
folded
it
in
a
small
compact
parcel
this
she
put
in
her
handbag
and
then
with
an
adorable
smile
said
now
you
beautiful
idiot
and
hendricks
devoured
her
with
his
eyes
all
i
can
tell
you
about
the
merediths
is
that
i
don
t
know
anything
about
their
stand
on
the
what
do
you
guess
assume
surmise
imagine
or
predict
she
teased
still
fascinating
him
with
her
magnetic
charm
well
i
think
this
they
re
a
little
too
to
take
up
all
my
projects
but
on
the
other
hand
they
re
far
from
willing
to
subscribe
to
your
husband
s
views
they
do
not
approve
of
the
atmosphere
he
wants
to
bring
about
nor
do
they
shut
their
eyes
to
the
fact
that
the
younger
element
must
be
younger
element
do
you
call
sanford
old
no
he
s
only
this
minute
but
there
are
a
lot
of
new
members
even
younger
than
that
strange
as
it
may
seem
these
boys
want
gayety
yea
even
unto
the
scorned
movies
and
the
hilarious
and
as
they
are
scions
of
the
wealthy
and
aristocratic
families
of
our
little
old
town
i
think
we
should
consider
them
and
since
you
insist
on
knowing
it
is
my
firm
belief
conviction
and
i
m
willing
to
add
my
hope
that
the
great
and
influential
meredith
brothers
agree
with
me
so
there
now
madam
sanford
embury
thank
you
alvord
you
re
clear
at
least
do
you
think
i
could
persuade
them
to
come
over
to
sanford
s
side
i
think
you
could
persuade
the
statue
of
jupiter
ammon
to
climb
down
from
his
pedestal
and
take
you
to
coney
island
if
you
looked
at
him
like
that
but
i
also
think
that
friend
husband
will
not
consent
to
your
electioneering
for
him
it
isn
t
done
my
dear
as
if
i
cared
what
is
done
and
what
isn
t
if
i
want
to
help
go
ahead
then
fair
lady
but
remember
that
sanford
embury
stands
for
the
conservative
element
in
our
club
and
anything
you
might
try
to
do
by
virtue
of
your
blandishments
or
fascinations
would
be
frowned
upon
and
would
react
against
your
cause
instead
of
for
it
if
i
might
suggest
my
supporters
the
younger
set
the
well
the
gayer
set
would
more
readily
respond
to
such
a
plan
why
don
t
you
electioneer
for
me
eunice
disdained
to
reply
and
aunt
abby
broke
into
the
discussion
by
exclaiming
oh
alvord
here
comes
mortimer
and
he
has
hanlon
with
him
sure
enough
the
two
heroes
of
the
day
were
walking
toward
the
hendricks
car
which
still
standing
near
the
scene
of
hanlon
s
triumph
awaited
a
good
chance
for
a
getaway
i
wonder
if
you
ladies
wouldn
t
like
to
meet
this
marvel
began
mortimer
genially
and
aunt
abby
s
delight
was
convincing
indeed
eunice
too
greeted
hanlon
cordially
and
hendricks
held
out
a
welcoming
hand
tell
us
how
you
did
it
he
said
smiling
into
the
intelligent
face
of
the
mysterious
you
saw
he
returned
simply
with
a
slight
gesture
of
palms
as
if
to
disavow
any
secrets
yes
i
saw
said
hendricks
but
with
me
seeing
is
not
don
t
listen
hanlon
mortimer
said
smiling
a
little
resentfully
that
sort
of
talk
would
go
before
the
test
but
not
now
what
do
you
mean
hendricks
by
not
believing
do
you
suspect
me
of
complicity
i
do
not
mortimer
i
believe
you
have
been
taken
in
with
the
rest
by
a
very
clever
he
looked
sharply
at
hanlon
who
returned
his
gaze
serenely
i
believe
this
young
man
is
unusually
apt
as
a
trickster
and
i
believe
he
hoodwinked
the
whole
community
the
fact
that
i
can
not
comprehend
or
even
guess
how
he
did
it
in
no
way
disturbs
my
conviction
that
he
did
do
it
by
trickery
i
will
change
this
opinion
however
if
hanlon
will
look
me
in
the
eye
and
assure
me
on
his
honor
that
he
found
the
penknife
by
no
other
means
or
with
no
other
influence
to
guide
him
than
mortimer
s
i
am
not
on
trial
he
said
i
am
not
called
upon
to
prove
or
disprove
anything
i
promised
to
perform
a
feat
and
i
have
done
so
it
was
not
nominated
in
the
bond
that
i
should
defend
my
honor
by
begging
the
question
laughed
hendricks
but
mortimer
said
not
at
all
hanlon
is
right
if
he
has
any
secret
means
of
guidance
it
is
up
to
us
to
discover
it
but
i
hold
that
he
can
not
have
or
it
would
have
been
discovered
by
some
of
the
eager
observers
we
had
thousands
looking
on
there
must
have
been
some
one
clever
enough
to
suspect
the
deceit
if
deceit
there
thank
you
mortimer
hanlon
spoke
quietly
i
made
no
mystery
of
my
performance
i
had
no
confederate
no
paraphernalia
all
there
was
to
see
could
be
seen
by
all
you
willed
me
i
followed
your
will
that
is
the
simple
manner
and
pleasant
demeanor
of
the
young
man
greatly
attracted
eunice
who
smiled
at
him
kindly
i
came
here
very
sceptical
she
admitted
and
even
now
i
can
t
feel
entirely
convinced
well
i
can
declared
aunt
abby
i
am
willing
to
own
it
too
these
people
who
really
believe
in
your
sincerity
hanlon
and
refuse
to
confess
it
make
me
mad
i
wish
you
d
give
an
exhibition
in
new
i
m
sorry
to
disappoint
you
madam
but
this
is
my
last
good
gracious
why
aunt
abby
looked
curiously
at
him
i
have
good
reasons
hanlon
smiled
you
may
learn
them
later
if
you
care
i
do
how
can
i
learn
them
read
the
newark
free
press
next
oh
and
eunice
had
an
inspiration
a
premonition
of
the
truth
may
i
speak
to
you
alone
a
minute
hanlon
she
got
out
of
the
car
and
walked
a
few
steps
with
the
young
man
who
politely
accompanied
her
they
paused
a
short
distance
away
and
held
a
brief
but
animated
conversation
eunice
laughed
gleefully
and
it
was
plain
to
be
seen
her
charming
smiles
played
havoc
with
hanlon
s
reserved
demeanor
soon
he
was
willingly
agreeing
to
something
she
was
proposing
and
finally
they
shook
hands
on
it
they
returned
to
the
car
he
assisted
eunice
in
and
then
he
told
mortimer
they
had
stayed
as
long
as
was
permissible
and
were
being
eagerly
called
back
to
the
committee
in
charge
of
the
day
s
programme
that
s
so
said
mortimer
i
begged
off
for
a
few
minutes
he
raised
his
hat
and
hurried
away
after
hanlon
well
said
hendricks
as
they
started
homeward
what
did
you
persuade
him
to
do
eunice
give
a
parlor
exhibition
for
you
the
boy
guessed
nearly
right
the
very
first
time
cried
eunice
gleefully
it
was
all
a
fake
and
he
s
coming
to
our
house
sunday
afternoon
to
tell
how
he
did
it
it
s
all
coming
out
in
the
paper
on
my
good
land
and
aunt
abby
sank
back
in
her
seat
utterly
disgusted
chapter
iv
the
emburys
and
that
s
my
last
word
on
the
embury
lighted
one
cigarette
from
the
stub
of
another
and
deposited
the
stub
in
the
at
his
elbow
it
was
sunday
afternoon
and
the
peculiar
relaxedness
of
that
day
of
rest
and
gladness
had
somewhat
worn
on
the
nerves
of
both
sanford
and
eunice
aunt
abby
was
napping
and
it
was
too
early
yet
to
look
for
their
expected
visitor
hanlon
eunice
had
been
once
again
endeavoring
to
persuade
her
husband
to
give
her
an
allowance
a
stated
sum
however
small
that
she
might
depend
upon
regularly
the
emburys
fulfilled
every
requirement
of
the
condition
known
as
happily
married
save
for
this
one
item
they
were
congenial
affectionate
and
quite
ready
to
make
allowances
for
each
other
s
idiosyncrasies
or
whims
with
this
one
exception
eunice
found
it
intolerable
to
be
cramped
and
pinched
for
small
amounts
of
ready
cash
when
her
husband
was
a
rich
man
nor
was
embury
mean
or
even
economical
of
nature
he
was
more
than
willing
that
his
wife
should
have
all
the
extravagant
luxuries
she
desired
he
was
entirely
ready
to
pay
any
and
all
bills
that
she
might
contract
never
had
he
chided
her
for
buying
expensive
or
unnecessary
finery
even
more
he
had
always
admired
her
taste
and
shown
pleasure
at
her
purchases
he
was
proud
of
her
beauty
and
willing
it
should
be
adorned
he
was
proud
of
her
grace
and
charm
and
willing
that
the
household
appointments
should
provide
an
appropriate
setting
for
her
hospitality
they
were
both
fond
of
entertaining
and
never
was
there
a
word
of
protest
from
him
as
to
the
amounts
charged
by
florists
and
caterers
and
yet
by
reason
of
some
crank
crotchet
or
perverse
notion
embury
was
unwilling
to
give
his
wife
what
is
known
as
pin
buy
your
pins
at
the
best
jewelers
he
would
laugh
and
send
the
bills
to
me
buy
your
hats
and
gowns
from
the
frenchiest
shops
you
can
get
credit
anywhere
on
my
name
good
lord
tiger
what
more
can
a
woman
want
nor
would
he
agree
to
her
explanations
that
there
were
a
thousand
and
one
occasions
when
some
money
was
an
absolute
necessity
or
if
persuaded
he
gave
her
a
small
amount
and
expected
it
to
last
indefinitely
it
is
difficult
to
know
just
what
was
the
reason
for
this
attitude
sanford
embury
was
not
a
miser
he
was
not
penurious
or
stingy
he
subscribed
liberally
to
charities
many
of
them
unknown
to
the
public
or
even
to
his
wife
but
some
trick
of
nature
some
twist
in
his
brain
made
this
peculiarity
of
his
persistent
and
ineradicable
now
eunice
embury
was
possessed
of
a
quick
sometimes
ungovernable
temper
it
was
because
of
this
that
her
husband
called
her
tiger
and
also
as
he
declared
because
her
beautiful
lithe
grace
was
suggestive
of
the
fearful
symmetry
of
the
forest
tribe
she
had
tried
honestly
to
control
her
quick
anger
but
it
would
now
and
then
assert
itself
in
spite
of
her
and
embury
delighted
to
liken
her
to
katherine
and
declared
that
he
must
tame
her
as
petruchio
tamed
his
shrew
this
annoyed
eunice
far
more
than
she
let
him
know
for
she
was
well
aware
that
if
he
thought
it
teased
her
he
would
more
frequently
try
petruchio
s
methods
so
when
she
flew
into
a
rage
and
he
countered
with
a
fiercer
anger
she
knew
he
was
assuming
it
purposely
and
she
usually
quieted
down
as
the
better
part
of
valor
on
this
particular
occasion
eunice
had
taken
advantage
of
a
quiet
pleasant
to
bring
up
the
subject
embury
had
heard
her
pleading
not
unkindly
but
with
a
bored
air
and
had
finally
remarked
as
she
paused
in
her
arguments
i
refuse
eunice
to
give
you
a
stated
allowance
if
you
haven
t
sufficient
confidence
in
your
husband
s
generosity
to
trust
him
to
give
you
all
you
want
or
need
and
even
more
than
that
then
you
are
ungrateful
for
what
i
have
given
you
and
that
s
my
last
word
on
the
the
rank
injustice
of
this
was
like
iron
entering
her
soul
she
knew
his
speech
was
illogical
unfair
and
even
absurd
but
she
knew
no
words
of
hers
could
make
him
see
it
so
and
in
utter
exasperation
at
her
own
impotence
she
flung
her
to
the
winds
and
let
go
of
her
temper
well
it
isn
t
my
last
word
on
the
subject
she
cried
i
have
something
further
to
say
that
is
your
woman
s
privilege
and
embury
smiled
irritatingly
at
her
not
only
my
privilege
but
my
duty
i
owe
it
to
my
to
my
social
position
to
my
standing
as
your
wife
the
wife
of
a
prominent
man
of
affairs
to
have
at
my
command
a
sum
of
ready
money
when
i
need
it
you
know
perfectly
well
i
do
not
want
it
for
anything
wrong
or
for
anything
that
i
want
to
keep
secret
from
you
you
know
i
have
never
had
a
secret
from
you
nor
do
i
wish
to
have
i
simply
want
to
do
as
other
women
do
even
the
poorest
the
meanest
man
will
give
his
wife
an
allowance
a
little
something
that
is
absolutely
her
own
why
most
of
the
women
of
my
set
have
a
checking
account
at
the
bank
they
all
have
a
personal
allowance
so
embury
took
up
another
cigarette
you
may
remember
eunice
i
have
spoken
my
last
word
on
the
and
you
may
remember
that
i
have
not
but
i
will
and
right
now
and
it
is
simply
that
since
you
refuse
me
the
pleasure
and
convenience
of
some
money
for
everyday
use
i
shall
get
some
from
another
embury
s
eyes
narrowed
and
he
surveyed
his
wife
with
a
calm
scrutiny
then
he
smiled
stenography
and
typewriting
he
said
or
shall
you
take
in
plain
sewing
cut
out
the
threats
eunice
they
won
t
get
you
anywhere
they
ll
get
me
where
i
want
to
arrive
don
t
say
i
didn
t
warn
you
i
repeat
i
shall
get
money
for
my
personal
use
and
you
will
have
no
right
to
criticize
my
methods
since
you
refuse
me
a
paltry
sum
by
way
of
eunice
was
standing
her
two
hands
tightly
grasping
a
as
she
looked
angrily
at
embury
who
still
seated
lazily
blew
smoke
rings
toward
her
she
was
magnificent
in
her
anger
her
cheeks
burned
crimson
her
dark
eyes
had
an
ominous
gleam
in
them
and
her
curved
lips
straightened
into
a
determined
line
of
scarlet
her
muscles
were
strained
and
tense
her
breath
came
quickly
yet
she
had
full
control
of
herself
and
her
pose
was
that
of
a
crouching
waiting
tiger
rather
than
a
furious
ode
embury
was
full
of
admiration
at
the
beautiful
picture
she
made
but
pursuant
of
his
inexorable
plan
he
rose
to
tame
her
tiger
tiger
burning
bright
he
quoted
you
must
take
back
that
speech
it
is
neither
pretty
nor
tactful
i
have
no
wish
to
be
tactful
why
should
i
i
am
not
trying
to
coax
or
cajole
you
you
refuse
my
request
you
have
repeatedly
refused
me
now
i
am
at
the
end
of
my
patience
and
i
shall
take
matters
into
my
own
hands
lovely
hands
he
murmured
taking
them
in
his
own
you
have
unusually
pretty
hands
eunice
it
would
be
a
pity
to
use
them
to
earn
yet
that
is
my
intention
i
shall
get
money
by
the
work
of
these
hands
it
will
be
in
a
way
that
you
will
not
approve
but
you
have
forfeited
your
right
to
approve
or
that
i
have
not
i
am
your
husband
you
have
promised
to
obey
me
a
mere
form
of
words
it
meant
nothing
our
marriage
ceremony
meant
nothing
if
it
did
remember
that
you
endowed
me
with
all
your
worldly
goods
and
i
give
them
to
you
too
do
you
know
that
of
my
yearly
expenditures
are
for
your
pleasure
and
benefit
i
enjoy
our
home
too
but
it
would
not
be
the
elaborate
luxurious
establishment
that
it
is
but
that
it
suits
your
taste
to
have
it
so
and
then
you
whine
and
fret
for
what
you
yourself
call
a
paltry
matter
ingrate
don
t
you
dare
call
me
ingrate
i
owe
you
no
gratitude
do
you
give
me
this
home
as
a
charity
as
a
gift
even
it
is
my
right
and
it
is
also
my
right
to
have
a
bank
account
of
my
own
it
is
my
right
to
uphold
my
head
among
other
women
who
laugh
at
me
who
ridicule
me
because
with
all
your
wealth
i
have
no
purse
of
my
own
i
will
not
stand
it
i
rebel
and
you
may
rest
assured
things
are
going
to
be
different
hereafter
i
will
get
money
you
shall
not
embury
grasped
the
wrists
of
the
hands
he
still
held
and
his
face
was
fiercely
frowning
you
are
my
wife
and
whatever
you
may
or
may
not
owe
to
me
you
owe
it
to
our
position
to
our
standing
in
the
community
to
do
nothing
beneath
your
dignity
or
mine
you
care
nothing
for
my
dignity
for
my
appearance
before
other
women
so
why
should
i
consider
your
dignity
you
force
me
to
it
and
it
is
therefore
your
fault
if
i
what
is
it
you
propose
to
do
how
are
you
going
to
get
this
absurd
paltry
sum
you
are
making
such
a
fuss
about
that
i
decline
to
tell
you
don
t
you
dare
to
do
needlework
or
anything
that
would
make
me
look
foolish
i
forbid
it
and
i
scorn
your
forbidding
make
you
look
foolish
indeed
when
you
make
me
look
foolish
every
day
of
my
life
because
i
can
t
do
as
other
women
do
can
t
have
what
other
wives
have
now
now
tiger
don
t
make
such
a
row
over
nothing
let
s
talk
it
over
seriously
there
s
nothing
to
talk
over
i
ve
asked
you
time
and
again
for
an
allowance
of
money
real
money
not
charge
accounts
and
you
always
refuse
and
always
shall
if
you
are
so
ugly
about
it
why
must
you
fly
into
a
rage
over
it
your
temper
is
my
temper
is
roused
by
your
cruelty
cruelty
yes
it
s
as
much
cruelty
as
if
you
struck
me
you
deny
me
my
heart
s
dearest
wish
for
no
reason
whatever
it
s
enough
that
i
don
t
approve
of
an
allowance
it
ought
to
be
enough
that
i
do
no
no
my
lady
i
love
you
i
adore
you
but
i
am
not
the
sort
of
man
to
lie
down
and
let
you
walk
over
me
i
give
you
everything
you
want
and
if
i
reserve
the
privilege
of
paying
for
it
myself
it
does
not
seem
to
me
a
crime
oh
do
hush
up
sanford
you
drive
me
frantic
you
prate
the
same
foolishness
over
and
over
i
don
t
want
to
hear
any
more
about
it
you
said
you
had
spoken
the
last
word
on
the
subject
now
stop
it
i
too
have
said
my
final
say
i
shall
do
as
i
please
and
i
shall
not
consider
myself
accountable
to
you
for
my
confound
it
do
what
you
please
then
i
wash
my
hands
of
your
nonsense
but
be
careful
how
you
carry
the
name
i
have
given
you
if
you
keep
on
i
may
decide
not
to
carry
it
at
all
eunice
was
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
ferdinand
announcing
the
arrival
of
mason
elliott
trained
in
the
school
of
convention
both
the
emburys
became
at
once
the
courteous
cordial
host

hostess

so
i
says
to
myself
s
posin
i
hop
along
and
listen
in
yes
i
am
interested
sufficiently
so
not
to
mind
your
jeers
about
bunk
and
oh
do
you
believe
in
it
mason
said
eunice
animatedly
for
this
is
a
faked
affair
or
rather
the
explanation
of
one
it
s
the
hanlon
boy
you
know
yes
i
know
but
what
s
the
racket
with
you
two
i
come
in
and
find
eunice
wearing
the
pet
expression
of
a
tragedy
queen
and
sanford
here
doing
the
irate
husband
going
into
the
movies
yes
that
s
it
and
eunice
smiled
bravely
although
her
lips
still
quivered
from
her
recent
turbulent
quarrel
and
a
light
jaunty
air
was
forced
to
conceal
her
lingering
nervousness
irate
husband
is
good
laughed
embury
considering
we
are
yet
good
dissemblers
both
of
you
and
elliott
settled
himself
in
an
easy
chair
but
you
don
t
fool
your
old
friend
talk
about
it
doesn
t
take
much
of
that
commodity
to
read
that
you
two
were
interrupted
by
my
entrance
in
the
middle
of
a
real
cats
all
right
have
it
your
own
way
and
embury
laughed
shortly
but
it
wasn
t
the
middle
of
it
it
was
about
all
but
the
making
up
shall
i
fade
away
for
fifteen
minutes
no
protested
eunice
it
was
only
one
of
the
little
tiffs
that
happen
in
the
best
families
now
listen
mason
my
dear
lady
i
live
but
on
the
chance
of
being
permitted
to
listen
to
you
only
in
the
hope
that
i
may
listen
early
and
often
oh
hush
what
a
silly
you
are
silly
is
it
remember
i
was
your
childhood
playmate
would
you
have
kept
me
on
your
string
all
these
years
if
i
were
silly
and
here
s
another
of
my
childhood
friends
how
do
you
do
most
gracious
lady
with
courtly
deference
elliott
rose
to
greet
aunt
abby
who
came
into
the
from
eunice
s
bedroom
her
black
silk
rustled
and
her
old
point
lace
fell
yellowly
round
her
slender
old
hands
for
on
sunday
afternoon
miss
ames
dressed
the
part
how
are
you
mason
she
said
but
with
a
preoccupied
air
what
time
is
hanlon
coming
eunice
soon
now
i
think
and
eunice
spoke
with
entire
composure
her
angry
excitement
all
subdued
it
was
characteristic
of
her
that
after
a
fit
of
temper
she
was
more
than
usually
soft
and
gentle
more
considerate
of
others
and
even
more
roguishly
merry
you
know
mason
that
what
we
are
to
be
told
is
a
most
inviolable
secret
that
is
it
is
a
secret
until
never
put
off
till
what
you
can
tell
returned
elliott
but
he
listened
attentively
while
eunice
and
aunt
abby
described
the
performance
of
the
young
man
hanlon
of
course
elliott
observed
a
little
disappointedly
if
he
says
he
hoaxed
the
crowd
of
course
he
did
but
in
that
case
i
ve
no
interest
in
the
thing
i
d
like
it
better
if
he
were
oh
he
s
honest
enough
corrected
embury
he
owns
right
up
that
it
was
a
trick
why
good
heavens
man
if
it
hadn
t
been
he
couldn
t
have
done
it
at
all
i
m
rather
keen
to
know
just
how
he
managed
though
for
the
yarn
of
eunice
and
aunt
abby
is
a
bit
don
t
depend
too
much
on
the
tale
of
interested
spectators
they
re
the
worst
possible
witnesses
they
see
only
what
they
wish
to
only
what
hanlon
wished
us
to
see
corrected
eunice
gaily
and
then
hanlon
himself
and
alvord
hendricks
arrived
together
met
on
the
doorstep
said
hendricks
as
he
came
in
mr
hanlon
is
a
little
so
it
s
lucky
i
happened
willy
hanlon
as
he
was
called
in
the
papers
came
shyly
forward
and
eunice
with
her
ready
tact
proceeded
to
put
him
at
once
at
his
ease
you
came
just
at
the
right
minute
to
help
me
out
she
said
smiling
at
him
they
are
saying
women
are
no
good
at
describing
a
scene
they
say
that
we
can
t
be
relied
on
for
accuracy
so
now
you
re
here
and
you
can
tell
what
really
yes
ma
am
and
hanlon
swallowed
a
little
embarrassedly
that
s
what
i
came
for
ma
am
but
first
are
you
all
straight
goods
will
you
all
promise
not
to
tell
what
i
tell
you
before
tomorrow
morning
they
all
promised
on
their
honor
and
satisfied
hanlon
began
his
tale
you
see
it
s
a
game
that
can
t
be
played
too
often
or
too
close
together
he
said
i
mean
if
i
put
it
over
around
here
i
can
t
risk
it
again
nearer
than
some
several
states
away
and
even
then
it
s
likely
to
get
caught
on
have
you
put
it
over
often
asked
hendricks
interestedly
yes
sir
well
say
about
a
dozen
times
altogether
now
i
m
going
to
chuck
it
for
it
s
too
risky
and
so
i
ve
sold
the
story
of
how
i
do
it
to
the
newspaper
syndicate
for
more
than
i
d
make
out
of
it
in
a
dozen
performances
you
can
read
it
all
in
s
papers
but
embury
she
asked
me
to
tell
it
here
and
i
said
yes
cause
cause
well
cause
i
wanted
to
the
boyish
outburst
was
so
unmistakably
one
of
admiration
of
immediate
capitulation
to
eunice
s
charm
that
she
blushed
adorably
and
the
others
laughed
outright
one
more
scalp
euny
said
elliott
oh
you
can
t
help
it
i
go
on
hanlon
said
eunice
and
he
went
on
you
see
to
make
you
understand
it
rightly
i
must
go
back
a
ways
i
ve
done
all
sorts
of
magic
stunts
and
i
m
kinda
fond
of
athletics
i
ve
given
exhibitions
along
both
those
lines
in
athletic
clubs
and
in
ladies
parlors
too
well
i
had
a
natural
talent
for
making
my
ears
move
lots
of
fellows
do
that
i
know
but
i
got
pretty
spry
at
what
for
asked
embury
nothing
particular
sir
only
one
thing
led
to
another
one
day
i
read
in
an
english
magazine
about
somebody
pulling
off
this
trick
this
blindfold
chase
and
i
said
to
myself
i
b
lieved
i
could
do
it
first
rate
and
maybe
make
easy
money
i
don
t
deny
i
m
out
after
the
coin
i
ve
got
to
get
my
living
and
if
i
d
rather
do
it
by
gulling
the
public
why
it
s
no
more
than
many
a
better
man
right
you
are
said
elliott
so
s
i
say
i
read
this
piece
that
told
just
how
to
do
it
and
i
set
to
work
you
may
think
it
s
funny
but
the
first
step
was
working
my
forehead
whatever
for
cried
aunt
abby
who
was
listening
perhaps
most
intently
of
all
i
ll
tell
you
in
a
jiffy
ma
am
and
hanlon
smiled
respectfully
at
the
eager
old
face
you
see
if
you
ll
take
notice
the
muscles
of
your
forehead
just
above
your
eyebrows
work
whenever
you
shut
or
open
your
eyes
yes
try
it
ma
am
as
aunt
abby
wrinkled
her
forehead
spasmodically
shut
your
eyes
ma
am
now
cover
them
closely
with
the
palm
of
your
left
hand
press
it
close
so
now
with
your
hand
there
open
your
eyes
slowly
and
feel
your
forehead
muscles
go
up
they
have
to
you
can
t
help
it
now
that
s
the
keynote
of
the
whole
clear
as
erebus
remarked
hendricks
i
don
t
get
you
nor
i
and
eunice
sat
with
her
hand
against
her
eyes
drawing
her
lovely
brows
into
contortions
well
never
mind
trying
i
ll
just
tell
you
about
hanlon
laughed
at
the
frantic
attempts
of
all
of
them
to
open
their
eyes
in
accordance
with
his
directions
anyhow
you
gentleman
know
for
i
know
you
all
belong
to
a
big
athletic
club
that
if
you
exercise
any
set
of
muscles
regularly
and
for
a
long
time
they
will
develop
and
expand
and
become
greatly
increased
in
size
and
sure
said
hendricks
i
once
developed
my
biceps
yes
that
s
what
i
mean
well
sir
i
worked
at
my
forehead
muscles
some
hours
a
day
for
months
and
i
kept
at
it
until
i
had
those
muscles
not
only
developed
and
in
fine
working
condition
but
absolutely
under
my
control
look
they
gazed
fascinated
while
the
strange
visitor
moved
the
skin
of
his
forehead
up
and
down
and
sideways
and
in
strange
circular
movements
he
seemed
distinctly
proud
of
his
accomplishment
and
paused
for
approbation
marvelous
holmes
marvelous
exclaimed
hendricks
who
had
discovered
that
hanlon
did
not
resent
jocularity
but
what
for
can
t
you
guess
and
the
young
man
smiled
mysteriously
give
it
up
and
hendricks
shook
his
head
i
think
it
s
more
wonderful
to
get
by
wiggling
your
forehead
than
any
other
way
i
ever
heard
of
but
i
can
t
guess
how
it
can
t
any
of
you
and
hanlon
looked
around
the
circle
wait
a
minute
said
aunt
abby
who
was
thinking
hard
let
me
try
is
it
because
when
the
thought
waves
jump
from
the
guide
to
you
they
strike
your
forehead
first
and
it
acts
as
a
wireless
receiving
station
no
ma
am
that
isn
t
it
and
too
ma
am
i
owned
up
you
know
that
the
whole
thing
was
a
fake
a
trick
you
see
there
was
no
not
any
none
at
then
what
do
you
accomplish
with
your
forehead
muscles
asked
eunice
unable
to
restrain
her
impatience
chapter
v
the
explanation
just
this
embury
the
impossibility
of
my
being
blindfolded
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
practically
impossible
to
blindfold
anybody
why
what
do
you
mean
interrupted
hendricks
why
is
it
because
the
natural
formation
of
most
people
s
noses
allows
them
to
see
straight
down
beneath
an
ordinary
bandage
i
doubt
if
one
child
out
of
a
hundred
who
plays
blind
man
s
buff
is
really
unable
to
see
at
that
s
so
said
embury
when
i
played
it
as
a
kid
i
could
always
see
straight
down
though
not
of
course
and
noses
are
different
went
on
hanlon
some
prominent
beaks
could
never
be
blindfolded
but
some
small
flat
noses
might
be
however
this
refers
to
ordinary
blindfolding
with
an
ordinary
handkerchief
when
it
comes
to
putting
fat
cotton
pads
in
one
s
eye
sockets
before
the
thick
bandage
is
added
it
necessitates
previous
preparation
so
my
powers
of
contracting
and
expanding
my
forehead
muscles
allow
me
to
push
the
pads
out
of
the
way
and
enable
me
to
see
straight
down
the
sides
of
my
nose
from
under
the
bandage
of
course
i
can
see
only
the
ground
and
that
but
in
a
circumscribed
area
around
my
feet
but
it
s
how
asked
eunice
her
piquant
face
eagerly
turned
to
the
speaker
how
did
you
know
which
way
to
turn
i
don
t
like
it
declared
aunt
abby
i
hate
it
i
m
absolutely
disgusted
with
the
whole
performance
i
detest
practical
jokes
oh
come
now
miss
ames
and
hendricks
chuckled
this
isn
t
exactly
a
joke
it
s
a
hoax
and
a
new
one
but
it
s
a
legitimate
game
from
the
davenport
brothers
and
herrmann
on
down
through
the
line
of
lesser
lights
in
the
conjuring
business
even
our
own
houdini
we
know
there
is
a
trick
somewhere
the
fun
is
in
finding
it
hanlon
s
is
a
new
one
and
a
gem
i
don
t
even
begin
to
see
through
it
neither
do
i
agreed
mason
eliott
i
think
to
do
what
he
did
by
a
trick
is
really
more
of
a
feat
than
to
be
led
by
real
except
that
the
real
thing
isn
t
available
and
hanlon
smiled
genially
as
he
said
this
and
embury
a
little
impatiently
urged
him
to
go
on
and
begged
the
others
to
cease
their
interruptions
well
hanlon
resumed
understand
then
that
i
can
not
be
really
blindfolded
no
committee
of
citizens
however
determined
can
bandage
my
eyes
in
such
a
manner
that
i
can
t
wiggle
my
forehead
about
sufficiently
to
get
the
pads
up
or
down
or
one
side
or
the
other
until
i
can
see
all
i
want
hanlon
knotted
up
his
frontal
muscles
to
prove
that
a
bandage
tied
tightly
would
become
loose
when
he
relaxed
the
strain
understand
that
i
can
see
the
ground
only
for
a
few
inches
directly
at
the
front
of
me
or
very
close
to
my
sides
that
is
said
hendricks
now
with
your
sight
assured
for
that
very
limited
space
what
is
next
that
sir
is
enough
to
explain
the
little
game
i
put
over
in
the
newspaper
office
before
trying
the
test
you
remember
ladies
mortimer
told
you
how
i
followed
a
chalk
line
drawn
on
the
floor
and
which
led
me
up
and
down
stairs
over
chairs
under
desks
and
all
that
well
it
was
dead
easy
because
i
could
see
the
line
on
the
floor
all
the
time
their
confidence
in
their
secure
blindfolding
made
them
entirely
unsuspicious
of
my
ability
to
see
so
that
was
clever
though
and
embury
looked
at
young
hanlon
with
admiration
simple
but
most
perfectly
yes
sir
it
was
the
very
simplicity
of
it
that
gulled
em
and
of
course
i
m
some
actor
i
groped
around
and
felt
my
way
by
chairs
and
railings
and
though
i
needn
t
have
touched
one
of
em
my
way
was
plainly
marked
and
i
could
see
the
chalk
line
and
all
i
had
to
do
was
to
follow
it
but
it
was
that
preliminary
test
that
fixed
it
in
their
minds
about
the
willing
business
i
kept
asking
the
guide
to
keep
his
mind
firmly
on
his
efforts
to
will
me
i
begged
him
to
use
all
his
mental
powers
to
keep
me
in
the
right
direction
oh
i
have
that
poppycock
all
down
fine
just
as
the
mediums
at
the
s√©ances
aunt
abby
sniffed
disdainfully
and
embury
chuckled
at
her
expression
though
not
a
spiritualist
miss
ames
was
greatly
interested
in
telepathy
and
kindred
subjects
and
like
all
the
apostles
of
such
cults
she
disliked
to
hear
of
frauds
committed
in
their
names
go
on
said
eunice
her
eyes
dancing
with
anticipation
i
love
a
hoax
of
this
sort
but
i
can
t
imagine
yet
how
you
did
it
i
understand
about
the
blindfolding
though
and
of
course
that
was
half
the
it
was
ma
am
and
the
other
half
was
boots
boots
yes
ma
am
do
you
know
that
you
seldom
see
two
pairs
of
boots
or
shoes
alike
on
men
i
thought
they
were
all
alike
exclaimed
eunice
i
mean
all
street
shoes
alike
and
all
pumps
alike
and
so
no
not
that
and
embury
laughed
but
i
say
hanlon
there
are
thousands
of
duplicates
not
so
you
d
notice
it
but
let
me
explain
first
however
here
are
four
men
present
let
s
compare
our
eight
feet
were
extended
and
it
was
surprising
to
note
the
difference
in
the
footgear
naturally
hanlon
s
were
of
a
cheaper
grade
than
the
others
but
whereas
it
might
have
been
expected
that
the
three
society
men
would
wear
almost
identical
boots
they
were
decidedly
varied
each
pair
was
correct
in
style
and
the
work
of
the
best
bootmakers
but
the
difference
in
the
design
of
tip
side
cut
sole
and
fastening
was
quite
sufficient
to
prevent
mistaking
one
for
another
you
see
said
hanlon
well
take
a
whole
lot
of
your
men
friends
even
if
they
all
go
to
the
same
bootmaker
and
you
ll
find
as
much
difference
i
don
t
mean
that
there
are
not
thousands
of
shoes
turned
out
in
the
same
factory
as
alike
as
peas
but
there
is
small
chance
of
striking
two
pairs
alike
in
any
group
of
men
then
too
there
is
the
wear
to
be
counted
on
suppose
two
of
you
men
had
bought
shoes
exactly
alike
you
wear
them
differently
one
may
run
over
his
heel
slightly
another
may
stub
out
the
toe
but
these
things
are
observable
only
to
a
trained
eye
so
i
trained
my
eye
i
made
a
study
of
it
and
now
if
i
see
a
shoe
once
i
never
forget
it
and
never
connect
it
with
the
wrong
man
on
the
street
in
the
cars
everywhere
i
go
i
look
at
shoes
or
rather
i
did
when
i
was
training
for
this
stunt
it
was
fascinating
really
why
sometimes
the
only
identifying
mark
would
be
the
places
worn
or
rubbed
by
the
bones
of
the
man
s
foot
but
it
was
there
allee
samee
i
nailed
m
every
one
oh
i
didn
t
remember
them
all
that
was
only
practice
but
here
s
the
application
when
i
started
on
that
trip
in
newark
i
was
introduced
to
mortimer
mind
you
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
ever
laid
eyes
on
the
man
well
unnoticed
by
anybody
of
course
i
caught
onto
his
shoes
they
were
probably
to
other
people
merely
ordinary
shoes
but
to
me
they
were
as
a
flaming
beacon
light
i
stamped
them
on
my
memory
every
detail
of
them
they
were
not
brand
new
for
of
course
anybody
would
choose
an
easy
old
pair
for
that
walk
so
there
were
scratches
bumps
and
worn
rubbed
places
that
with
their
general
rendered
them
unmistakable
to
yours
truly
then
i
was
ready
the
earnest
but
committee
carefully
adjusted
their
useless
pads
of
cotton
and
their
thick
bandage
over
my
eyes
and
i
was
led
forth
to
the
fray
remember
i
asked
mortimer
not
only
to
think
of
the
hidden
penknife
and
will
me
toward
it
but
also
to
look
toward
it
himself
now
to
look
toward
any
object
a
man
usually
turns
his
whole
body
in
that
direction
so
groping
about
clumsily
i
managed
to
get
sight
of
the
toes
of
those
boots
seeing
which
way
they
were
pointed
was
all
the
information
i
needed
just
then
so
with
all
sorts
of
hesitating
movements
and
false
starts
i
finally
trotted
off
in
the
direction
he
had
faced
the
rest
is
easy
of
course
coming
to
a
corner
i
was
absolutely
in
the
dark
as
to
whether
i
was
to
turn
or
to
keep
straight
ahead
this
necessitated
my
turning
back
to
mortimer
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
which
way
his
feet
were
pointing
i
covered
this
by
speaking
to
him
begging
him
to
will
me
aright
to
will
me
more
earnestly
or
some
such
bunk
i
could
invent
many
reasons
for
turning
round
pretend
i
had
lost
my
feeling
of
guidance
or
pretend
i
heard
a
sudden
noise
as
of
danger
or
even
pretend
i
felt
i
was
going
wrong
well
i
got
a
peek
at
those
feet
as
often
as
was
necessary
and
the
rest
was
just
to
mislead
the
people
s
minds
of
course
when
i
stumbled
over
a
stone
or
nearly
fell
into
a
coal
hole
or
grating
it
was
all
pretense
i
saw
the
pavements
as
well
as
anybody
and
my
effort
was
to
seem
unaware
of
what
was
coming
had
i
carefully
avoided
obstacles
they
would
know
i
could
and
when
you
reached
that
vacant
lot
prompted
eunice
i
saw
friend
mortimer
s
feet
were
pointing
toward
the
center
of
the
lot
and
not
in
the
direction
of
either
street
so
i
turned
in
and
when
i
got
where
i
could
see
the
house
i
guessed
that
was
the
so
i
circled
around
it
urging
my
guide
to
look
toward
the
place
and
then
noting
his
feet
i
had
to
do
a
bit
of
scratching
about
but
remember
i
could
see
perfectly
and
i
felt
sure
the
knife
was
in
the
charred
and
blackened
rubbish
so
i
just
hunted
till
i
found
it
that
s
well
it
does
sound
simple
and
easy
as
you
tell
it
but
believe
me
hanlon
i
appreciate
the
cleverness
of
the
thing
and
the
real
work
you
went
through
in
preparation
for
it
all
hendricks
said
heartily
and
the
other
men
added
words
of
admiration
and
approval
but
miss
ames
was
distinctly
displeased
i
wouldn
t
mind
if
you
d
advertised
it
as
a
trick
she
said
in
an
injured
tone
as
say
the
conjurors
do
such
tricks
but
everybody
knows
they
re
fooling
their
audience
it
is
yes
lady
hanlon
smiled
but
the
fake
mediums
and
they
don
t
say
they
re
frauds
but
they
sir
you
don
t
know
what
you
re
talking
about
just
because
there
are
some
tricksters
in
that
as
in
all
professions
you
must
not
denounce
them
they
re
all
fakes
lady
and
hanlon
s
air
of
sincerity
carried
conviction
to
all
but
aunt
abby
how
do
you
know
she
demanded
angrily
i
ve
looked
into
it
i
ve
looked
into
all
sorts
of
stunts
like
these
it
s
in
my
nature
i
guess
and
all
professional
mediums
are
frauds
you
bank
on
that
ma
am
if
you
want
to
tip
tables
or
run
a
ouija
board
with
some
honest
friends
of
yours
go
ahead
but
any
man
or
woman
who
takes
your
money
for
showing
you
spiritual
revelations
of
any
sort
is
a
fraud
and
a
there
s
no
exception
asked
embury
quite
surprised
not
among
the
professionals
they
wouldn
t
keep
on
in
their
profession
if
they
didn
t
put
up
the
goods
and
to
do
that
they
ve
got
to
use
the
why
why
young
man
cried
aunt
abby
explosively
you
just
read
the
voice
of
isis
you
read
that
s
all
right
they
are
plenty
of
fake
books
more
prob
ly
than
fake
mediums
but
you
read
some
books
that
i
ll
recommend
you
read
behind
the
scenes
with
the
mediums
or
the
spirit
world
unveiled
and
see
where
you
re
at
then
no
ma
am
the
only
good
spook
is
a
dead
spook
and
they
don
t
come
back
to
but
and
eunice
gazed
earnestly
at
her
guest
is
there
nothing
nothing
at
all
in
telepathy
now
you
ve
asked
a
question
ma
am
i
don
t
say
there
isn
t
but
i
do
say
there
isn
t
two
per
cent
of
what
the
fakers
claim
there
is
i
ll
grant
just
about
two
per
cent
of
real
stuff
in
this
talk
of
telepathy
and
and
even
that
is
mostly
getting
a
letter
the
very
day
you
were
thinking
about
the
writer
embury
laughed
that
s
as
close
as
i
ve
ever
come
to
it
he
said
yep
that
s
the
commonest
stunt
that
and
the
ghostly
appearance
of
a
friend
that
s
dyin
at
the
time
in
a
distant
aren
t
those
cases
ever
true
eunice
asked
bout
two
per
cent
of
em
most
of
those
that
have
been
traced
down
to
actual
evidence
have
fizzled
out
well
i
must
be
going
you
see
now
i
ve
sold
this
whole
spiel
that
i
ve
just
given
you
folks
to
a
big
newspaper
syndicate
and
i
got
well
paid
that
puts
me
on
easy
street
for
the
time
bein
and
i
m
going
to
practice
up
for
a
new
stunt
when
you
hear
again
of
willy
hanlon
it
ll
be
in
a
very
different
line
of
goods
what
asked
eunice
interestedly
scuse
me
ma
am
i
d
tell
you
if
i
d
tell
anybody
but
you
see
it
ain
t
good
business
i
just
thought
up
a
new
line
of
work
and
i
m
going
to
take
time
to
perfect
myself
in
it
and
then
spring
it
on
a
no
i
won
t
ask
you
to
tell
of
course
eunice
agreed
but
when
you
give
an
exhibition
if
it
s
near
new
york
let
me
know
won
t
you
yes
ma
am
i
sure
will
and
now
i
ll
move
oh
no
you
must
wait
for
a
cup
of
tea
we
ll
have
it
brought
at
eunice
left
the
room
for
a
moment
aunt
abby
in
dudgeon
refused
to
talk
to
the
disappointing
visitor
but
the
three
men
quickly
engaged
him
in
conversation
and
hanlon
told
some
anecdotes
of
his
past
experiences
that
kept
them
interested
ferdinand
brought
in
the
tea
things
and
eunice
with
her
graceful
hospitality
saw
to
it
that
her
guest
was
in
no
way
embarrassed
or
bothered
by
unaccustomed
service
i
ve
had
a
right
good
time
he
said
in
his
boyish
way
as
he
rose
to
go
thank
you
ma
am
for
the
tea
and
things
i
liked
it
his
comprehensive
glance
that
swept
the
room
and
its
occupants
was
a
sincere
compliment
and
after
he
had
gone
there
was
only
kindly
comment
on
his
personality
except
from
aunt
abby
he
s
an
ignorant
boor
she
announced
now
now
objected
eunice
you
only
say
that
because
he
upset
your
favorite
delusions
he
punctured
your
bubbles
and
pulled
down
your
give
it
up
aunt
abby
there
s
nothing
in
your
voice
of
isis
racket
permit
me
to
be
the
judge
of
my
own
five
senses
eunice
if
you
that
s
just
it
miss
ames
spoke
up
hendricks
is
your
psychic
information
or
whatever
it
is
discernible
to
your
five
senses
or
any
of
them
of
course
or
how
could
i
realize
the
presence
of
the
psychic
forces
i
don
t
know
just
what
those
things
are
but
i
supposed
they
were
available
only
to
a
sort
of
sixth
sense
or
seventh
why
i
have
five
senses
but
i
don
t
lay
claim
to
any
more
than
you
re
a
trifler
and
i
decline
to
discuss
the
subject
seriously
with
you
you
ve
always
been
a
trifler
alvord
remember
i
ve
known
you
from
boyhood
and
though
you
ve
a
brilliant
brain
you
have
not
utilized
it
to
the
best
sorry
ma
am
and
the
handsome
face
put
on
a
mock
penitence
but
i
m
too
far
advanced
in
years
to
pull
up
nonsense
you
re
barely
thirty
that
s
a
young
not
nowadays
they
say
after
thirty
a
man
begins
to
fall
to
pieces
oh
al
what
nonsense
cried
eunice
why
thirty
isn
t
even
far
enough
along
to
be
called
the
prime
of
life
oh
yes
it
is
eunice
in
this
day
and
generation
nobody
thinks
a
man
can
do
any
great
creative
work
after
thirty
inventing
you
know
or
art
or
literature
honestly
that
s
the
attitude
now
isn
t
it
mason
elliott
looked
serious
it
is
an
opinion
recently
expressed
by
some
big
man
he
admitted
but
i
don
t
subscribe
to
it
why
i
d
be
sorry
to
think
i
m
a
and
i
m
in
the
class
with
you
and
you
re
none
of
you
in
the
sere
and
yellow
declared
eunice
laughing
at
the
idea
why
even
aunt
abby
in
spite
of
the
family
record
is
about
as
young
as
any
of
i
know
i
am
said
the
old
lady
serenely
and
i
know
more
about
my
hobby
of
psychic
lore
in
a
minute
than
you
young
things
ever
heard
of
in
all
your
life
so
don
t
attempt
to
tell
me
what
s
what
that
s
right
miss
ames
you
do
and
mason
elliott
looked
earnestly
at
her
i
m
half
inclined
to
go
over
to
your
side
myself
will
you
take
me
some
time
to
one
of
your
s√©ances
but
wait
i
only
want
to
go
to
one
where
as
you
said
the
psychic
manifestations
are
perceptible
to
one
or
more
of
the
five
senses
i
don
t
want
any
of
this
talk
of
a
mysterious
sixth
oh
mason
i
wish
you
would
go
with
me
madame
medora
gives
wonderful
readings
mason
i
m
ashamed
of
you
cried
eunice
laughing
don
t
let
him
tease
you
aunt
abby
he
doesn
t
mean
a
word
he
says
oh
but
i
do
i
want
to
learn
to
read
other
people
s
thoughts
not
like
our
friend
hanlon
but
really
by
means
of
my
senses
and
you
prove
you
haven
t
any
brain
when
you
talk
like
that
put
in
hendricks
contemptuously
and
you
prove
you
haven
t
any
sense
retorted
elliott
i
say
who
s
for
a
walk
i
ve
got
to
sweep
the
cobwebs
out
of
the
place
where
my
brain
ought
to
be
even
if
it
is
empty
as
my
learned
colleague
i
ll
go
and
eunice
jumped
up
i
want
a
breath
of
fresh
air
come
along
san
nixy
i
ve
got
to
look
over
some
papers
in
connection
with
my
coming
election
as
president
of
a
big
your
coming
election
may
come
when
you
re
really
in
the
prime
of
life
hendricks
laughed
or
perhaps
not
till
you
strike
the
sere
and
yellow
but
if
you
refer
to
this
year
s
campaign
of
the
athletic
club
please
speak
of
my
coming
oh
you
two
deadly
rivals
exclaimed
eunice
i
m
glad
to
be
out
of
it
if
you
re
going
to
talk
about
those
eternal
and
club
theatres
come
on
mason
let
s
go
for
a
brisk
walk
in
the
eunice
went
to
her
room
and
came
back
looking
unusually
beautiful
in
a
new
spring
habit
the
soft
fawn
color
suited
her
dark
type
and
a
sable
scarf
round
her
throat
left
exposed
an
adorable
triangle
of
creamy
white
flesh
get
through
with
your
squabbling
little
boys
she
said
gaily
with
a
saucy
smile
at
hendricks
and
a
swift
perfunctory
kiss
on
embury
s
cheek
and
then
she
went
away
with
mason
elliott
they
walked
a
few
blocks
in
silence
and
then
elliott
said
abruptly
what
were
you
and
sanford
quarreling
about
aren
t
you
a
little
intrusive
but
a
smile
accompanied
the
words
no
eunice
it
isn
t
intrusion
i
have
the
right
of
an
old
friend
more
than
a
friend
from
my
point
of
view
and
i
ask
only
from
the
best
and
kindest
could
you
explain
some
those
motives
she
tried
to
make
her
voice
cold
and
distant
but
only
succeeded
in
making
it
pathetic
i
could
but
i
think
it
better
wiser
and
more
honorable
not
to
you
know
dear
why
i
want
to
know
because
i
want
you
to
be
the
happiest
woman
in
the
whole
world
and
if
sanford
embury
can
t
make
you
so
nobody
can
she
interrupted
him
quickly
don
t
mason
she
turned
a
pleading
look
toward
him
don
t
say
anything
we
may
both
regret
you
know
how
good
sanford
is
to
me
you
know
how
happy
we
are
were
he
corrected
very
gravely
were
and
are
she
insisted
and
you
know
too
no
one
better
what
a
fiendish
temper
i
have
though
i
try
my
best
to
control
it
it
breaks
out
now
and
then
and
i
am
helpless
sanford
thinks
he
can
tame
it
by
giving
me
as
good
as
i
send
by
playing
as
he
calls
it
petruchio
to
my
katherine
but
somehow
i
don
t
believe
that
s
the
treatment
i
her
dark
eyes
were
wistful
but
she
did
not
look
at
him
of
course
it
isn
t
elliott
returned
in
a
low
voice
i
know
your
nature
eunice
i
ve
known
it
all
our
lives
you
need
kindness
when
you
are
in
a
tantrum
the
outbursts
of
temper
you
can
not
help
that
i
know
positively
they
re
an
integral
part
of
your
nature
but
they
re
soon
over
often
the
fiercer
they
are
the
quicker
they
pass
and
if
you
were
gently
managed
not
brutally
at
the
time
they
occur
it
would
go
far
to
help
you
to
overcome
them
entirely
but
and
i
ask
you
again
what
were
you
discussing
when
i
came
why
do
you
want
to
know
i
think
i
do
know
and
forgive
me
if
i
offend
you
i
think
i
can
help
what
do
you
mean
eunice
looked
up
with
a
frightened
stare
don
t
look
like
that
oh
eunice
don
t
i
only
meant
i
know
you
want
money
ready
money
let
me
give
it
to
you
or
lend
it
to
you
do
eunice
darling
thank
you
mason
eunice
forced
herself
to
say
but
i
must
refuse
your
offer
i
think
i
think
we
we
ll
go
home
chapter
vi
a
slammed
door
don
t
you
call
her
that
desternay
woman
i
ll
call
her
what
i
please
and
without
asking
your
permission
either
and
i
won
t
have
my
wife
playing
bridge
at
what
is
practically
a
gambling
house
nothing
of
the
sort
a
party
of
invited
guests
in
a
private
house
is
a
social
affair
and
you
shall
not
call
it
ridiculous
names
you
play
for
far
higher
stakes
at
your
club
than
we
ever
do
at
fifi
desternay
that
name
is
enough
fancy
your
associating
with
a
woman
who
calls
herself
fifi
she
can
t
help
her
name
it
was
probably
wished
on
her
by
her
parents
in
baptism
it
probably
was
not
she
was
probably
christened
mary
jane
you
seem
to
know
a
lot
about
i
know
all
i
want
to
and
you
have
reached
the
end
of
your
acquaintance
with
her
and
her
set
you
are
not
to
go
there
eunice
and
that
s
all
there
is
about
the
emburys
were
in
eunice
s
bedroom
sanford
was
in
evening
dress
and
was
about
to
leave
for
his
club
eunice
who
had
dined
in
a
neglig√©e
was
donning
an
elaborate
evening
costume
she
had
dismissed
her
maid
when
embury
came
into
the
room
and
was
herself
adjusting
the
finishing
touches
her
gown
of
chiffon
with
touches
of
gold
embroidery
was
most
becoming
to
her
dark
beauty
and
some
fine
ornaments
of
ancient
carved
gold
gave
an
oriental
touch
to
her
appearance
she
stood
before
a
long
mirror
noting
the
details
of
her
gown
and
showed
an
irritating
lack
of
attention
to
embury
s
last
dictum
you
heard
me
eunice
he
said
caustically
his
hand
on
the
doorknob
not
being
deaf
i
did
she
returned
without
looking
toward
him
and
you
will
obey
me
he
turned
back
and
reaching
her
side
he
grasped
her
arm
with
no
uncertain
touch
i
demand
your
obedience
demands
are
not
always
granted
she
gave
him
a
dazzling
smile
but
it
was
defiant
rather
than
friendly
i
make
it
a
request
then
will
you
grant
me
that
why
should
i
grant
your
requests
when
you
won
t
grant
mine
good
lord
eunice
are
you
going
to
harp
on
that
allowance
string
again
i
am
why
shouldn
t
i
when
it
warps
my
whole
life
oh
come
cut
out
the
hifalutin
talk
well
then
to
come
down
to
plain
facts
there
isn
t
a
day
that
i
m
not
humiliated
and
embarrassed
by
the
lack
of
a
little
bad
as
that
yes
quite
as
bad
as
that
why
the
day
we
went
out
to
newark
i
didn
t
have
five
cents
to
buy
aunt
abby
a
newspaper
and
she
had
to
get
along
without
one
she
seemed
to
live
through
sanford
you
re
unbearable
and
at
garland
s
a
woman
talked
and
then
they
took
up
a
collection
for
the
belgian
home
fires
and
i
didn
t
have
a
cent
to
who
is
she
i
ll
send
a
a
check
you
answer
everything
by
a
check
can
t
you
understand
oh
there
s
no
use
explaining
you
re
determined
you
won
t
understand
so
let
us
drop
the
subject
is
the
club
election
no
night
but
will
probably
decide
it
in
my
mind
it
practically
hinges
on
the
meredith
set
if
they
can
be
talked
over
oh
sanford
i
do
hope
they
can
eunice
s
eyes
sparkled
and
she
smiled
as
she
put
her
hands
on
her
husband
s
shoulders
and
listen
dear
if
they
are
if
you
do
win
the
election
won
t
you
oh
san
won
t
you
give
me
an
allowance
eunice
you
re
enough
to
drive
a
man
crazy
will
you
let
up
on
that
everlasting
whine
no
i
won
t
is
that
plain
then
i
shall
go
and
get
it
for
myself
go
to
the
devil
for
all
i
care
sanford
flung
out
of
the
room
banging
the
door
behind
him
eunice
heard
him
speaking
to
ferdinand
rather
shortly
and
as
he
left
the
apartment
she
knew
that
he
had
gone
to
the
club
in
their
motor
car
and
if
she
went
out
she
would
have
to
call
a
cab
she
began
to
take
off
her
gown
half
deciding
to
stay
at
home
she
had
never
run
counter
to
embury
s
expressed
orders
and
she
hesitated
to
do
so
now
and
yet
the
question
of
money
so
summarily
dismissed
by
her
husband
was
a
very
real
trouble
to
her
in
her
social
position
she
actually
needed
ready
cash
frequently
and
she
had
determined
to
get
it
her
last
hope
of
sanford
failed
her
when
he
refused
to
grant
her
wish
as
a
sort
of
celebration
of
his
election
and
she
persuaded
herself
that
it
was
her
right
to
get
some
money
somehow
her
proposed
method
was
by
no
means
a
certain
one
for
it
was
the
hazardous
plan
of
winning
at
bridge
although
a
player
eunice
often
had
streaks
of
bad
luck
and
too
inexpert
partners
were
a
dangerous
factor
but
though
she
sometimes
said
that
winnings
and
losings
came
out
about
even
in
the
long
run
she
had
found
by
keeping
careful
account
her
skill
made
it
probable
for
her
to
win
more
than
she
lost
and
this
reasoning
prompted
her
to
risk
high
stakes
in
hope
of
winning
something
fifi
desternay
was
a
recent
acquaintance
of
hers
and
not
a
member
of
the
set
eunice
looked
upon
as
her
own
but
the
gatherings
at
the
desternay
house
were
gay
and
pleasant
a
bit
bohemian
yet
exclusive
too
and
eunice
had
already
spent
several
enjoyable
afternoons
there
she
had
never
been
in
the
evening
for
embury
wouldn
t
go
and
had
refused
to
let
her
go
without
him
nor
did
she
want
to
for
it
was
not
eunice
s
way
to
go
out
alone
at
night
but
she
was
desperate
and
moreover
she
was
exceedingly
angry
sanford
was
unjust
and
unkind
also
he
had
been
cross
and
ugly
and
had
left
her
in
anger
a
thing
that
had
never
happened
before
and
she
wanted
some
money
at
once
a
sale
of
laces
was
to
be
held
next
day
at
a
friend
s
home
and
she
wanted
to
go
there
properly
prepared
to
purchase
some
bits
if
she
chose
to
her
cheeks
flushed
as
she
remembered
mason
elliott
s
offer
to
give
or
lend
her
money
but
she
smiled
gently
as
she
remembered
the
true
friendliness
of
the
man
and
his
which
took
all
sting
from
his
offer
as
she
brooded
her
anger
became
more
fierce
and
finally
with
a
toss
of
her
head
she
rose
from
the
chair
rang
for
the
maid
and
proceeded
to
finish
her
toilette
lend
me
some
money
will
you
aunt
abby
she
asked
as
all
ready
to
go
she
stepped
into
the
livingroom
she
had
no
hesitancy
in
making
this
appeal
if
she
won
she
would
repay
on
her
return
if
she
lost
aunt
abby
was
a
waiter
and
she
knew
eunice
would
pay
later
bridge
said
the
old
lady
smiling
at
the
lovely
picture
eunice
made
in
her
low
gown
and
her
billowy
satin
wrap
i
thought
sanford
took
the
he
did
i
m
going
in
a
taxi
what
a
duck
you
are
to
let
me
have
this
as
she
spoke
she
stuffed
the
bills
in
her
soft
gold
don
t
sit
up
dear
i
ll
be
out
till
all
where
are
you
going
to
the
end
of
the
rainbow
where
there
s
a
pot
of
gold
you
read
your
spook
books
and
then
go
to
bed
and
dream
of
ghosts
and
specters
eunice
kissed
her
lightly
and
gathering
up
her
floating
draperies
went
out
of
the
room
with
the
faithful
and
efficient
ferdinand
on
his
way
to
the
club
embury
pursued
that
pleasing
occupation
known
as
nursing
his
wrath
he
was
sorry
he
had
left
eunice
in
anger
he
realized
it
was
the
first
time
that
had
ever
happened
and
he
was
tempted
to
go
back
or
at
least
to
telephone
back
that
he
was
sorry
but
that
would
do
little
good
he
knew
unless
he
also
said
he
was
willing
to
accede
to
her
request
for
an
allowance
and
that
he
was
as
sternly
set
against
as
ever
he
couldn
t
quite
have
told
himself
why
he
was
so
positive
in
this
matter
but
it
was
largely
owing
to
an
instinctive
sense
of
the
fitness
of
having
a
wife
dependent
on
her
husband
for
all
things
moreover
it
seemed
to
him
that
unlimited
charge
accounts
betokened
a
greater
generosity
than
an
allowance
and
he
felt
an
aggrieved
irritation
at
eunice
s
seeming
ingratitude
the
matter
of
her
wanting
now
and
then
seemed
to
him
too
petty
to
be
worthy
of
serious
consideration
he
really
believed
that
he
gave
her
money
whenever
she
asked
for
it
and
was
all
unaware
how
hard
he
made
it
for
her
to
ask
the
more
he
thought
about
it
the
more
he
saw
eunice
in
the
wrong
and
himself
an
injured
unappreciated
benefactor
he
adored
his
wife
but
this
peculiarity
of
hers
must
be
put
an
end
to
somehow
her
temper
too
was
becoming
worse
instead
of
better
her
outbreaks
were
more
frequent
more
furious
and
he
had
less
power
to
quell
them
than
formerly
clearly
he
concluded
eunice
must
be
taught
a
lesson
and
this
occasion
must
be
made
a
test
case
he
had
left
her
angrily
and
it
might
turn
out
that
it
was
the
best
thing
he
could
have
done
poor
girl
she
doubtless
was
sorry
enough
by
now
crying
probably
his
heart
softened
as
he
conjured
up
the
picture
of
his
wife
alone
and
in
tears
but
he
reasoned
that
it
would
do
her
good
and
he
would
give
her
a
new
jewel
to
make
up
for
it
after
the
trouble
was
all
over
so
he
went
on
to
the
club
and
dove
into
the
great
business
of
the
last
possible
chance
of
electioneering
though
friendly
through
all
this
campaign
the
strain
was
beginning
to
tell
on
the
two
candidates
and
both
embury
and
hendricks
found
it
a
little
difficult
to
keep
up
their
good
feeling
but
they
both
reasoned
as
soon
as
the
election
is
over
we
ll
be
all
right
again
we
re
both
too
good
sports
to
hold
rancor
or
to
feel
any
and
this
was
true
men
of
the
world
men
of
minds
clever
logical
and
just
they
were
fighting
hard
each
for
his
own
side
but
once
the
matter
was
decided
they
would
be
again
the
same
old
friends
however
embury
was
just
as
well
pleased
to
learn
that
hendricks
was
out
of
town
he
had
gone
to
boston
on
an
important
business
matter
and
though
it
was
not
so
stated
embury
was
pretty
sure
that
the
important
business
was
closely
connected
with
the
coming
election
in
his
own
endeavor
to
secure
votes
embury
was
not
above
playing
the
to
him
unusual
game
of
being
all
things
to
all
men
and
this
brought
him
into
cordial
conversation
with
one
of
the
younger
club
members
who
was
of
the
type
he
generally
went
out
of
his
way
to
avoid
try
to
put
yourself
in
our
place
embury
the
cub
was
saying
we
want
this
club
to
be
and
beyond
conservatism
is
all
very
well
and
we
all
practiced
it
for
the
duration
but
now
the
war
s
over
let
s
have
some
fun
say
we
i
know
billy
but
there
is
a
certain
standard
to
be
maintained
we
the
people
of
the
united
states
and
tiddle
tya
tya
tya
why
everybody
s
doing
it
the
women
bless
em
too
i
just
left
your
wife
at
a
table
with
my
wife
and
the
pile
of
chips
between
em
would
make
some
men
s
hide
their
diminished
walls
that
so
you
saw
my
wife
this
evening
where
as
if
you
didn
t
know
but
good
heavens
perhaps
you
didn
t
have
i
been
indiscreet
not
at
all
at
desternay
s
wasn
t
it
yes
but
you
gave
me
a
jolt
i
was
afraid
i
d
not
at
all
they
re
well
between
you
and
me
they
oughtn
t
to
be
i
let
gladys
go
under
protest
i
left
her
there
myself
but
it
s
never
again
for
her
i
shall
tell
her
so
embury
changed
the
subject
and
by
using
all
his
gave
no
hint
of
his
wrath
so
eunice
had
gone
after
all
after
his
expressly
forbidding
it
it
was
almost
unbelievable
and
within
an
hour
of
his
receiving
information
sanford
embury
in
his
own
car
stopped
at
the
desternay
house
smiling
and
debonair
as
he
entered
the
drawingroom
he
greeted
the
hostess
and
asked
for
his
wife
oh
don
t
disturb
her
dear
embury
begged
the
vivacious
fifi
she
s
out
for
blood
she
s
in
the
den
with
three
of
our
wizards
and
the
sky
s
their
limit
tut
tut
what
naughtiness
embury
s
manner
was
just
the
right
degree
of
playful
reproach
and
his
fine
poise
and
distinguished
air
attracted
attention
from
many
of
the
players
the
rooms
were
filled
without
being
crowded
and
a
swift
mental
of
the
appointments
and
atmosphere
convinced
the
newcomer
that
his
preconception
of
the
place
was
about
right
i
must
take
her
away
before
she
cleans
out
the
bunch
he
laughed
and
made
progress
toward
the
here
you
are
he
said
lightly
as
he
came
upon
eunice
with
another
woman
and
two
men
all
of
whom
were
silently
concentrating
on
what
was
quite
evidently
a
stiff
game
yes
here
i
am
she
returned
don
t
speak
please
until
i
finish
this
eunice
was
playing
the
hand
and
though
her
face
paled
and
a
spot
of
bright
color
appeared
on
either
cheek
she
did
not
lose
her
head
and
carried
the
hand
through
to
a
successful
conclusion
game
and
rubber
she
cried
triumphantly
and
the
vanquished
pair
nodded
regretfully
and
the
last
game
please
for
my
wife
embury
said
in
calm
courteous
tones
you
can
get
a
substitute
of
course
come
eunice
there
was
something
icy
in
his
tones
that
made
eunice
shiver
though
it
was
not
noticeable
to
strangers
and
she
rose
smiling
with
a
few
gay
words
of
apology
perfectly
awful
of
me
to
leave
when
i
m
winning
she
said
but
there
are
times
you
know
when
one
remembers
the
obey
plank
in
the
matrimonial
platform
dear
fifi
forgive
me
she
moved
about
gracefully
saying
a
word
or
two
of
farewell
and
then
disappeared
to
get
her
wrap
with
as
little
disturbance
as
possible
of
the
other
players
you
naughty
man
and
desternay
shook
her
finger
at
embury
if
you
weren
t
so
i
should
put
you
in
my
black
books
that
would
at
least
keep
me
in
your
memory
he
returned
but
his
smile
was
now
quite
evidently
a
forced
one
and
his
words
of
farewell
were
few
as
he
led
eunice
from
the
house
and
down
to
the
car
he
handed
her
in
and
then
sat
beside
her
as
the
chauffeur
turned
homeward
not
a
word
was
spoken
by
either
of
them
during
the
whole
ride
several
times
eunice
decided
to
break
the
silence
but
concluded
not
to
she
was
both
angry
and
frightened
but
the
anger
predominated
embury
sat
motionless
his
face
pale
and
stern
and
when
they
arrived
at
their
own
house
he
assisted
her
from
the
car
quite
as
usual
dismissed
the
chauffeur
with
a
word
of
orders
for
the
next
day
and
then
the
pair
went
into
the
house
ferdinand
met
them
at
their
door
and
performed
his
efficient
and
accustomed
services
and
then
after
a
glance
at
her
husband
eunice
went
into
her
own
room
and
closed
the
door
embury
smoked
a
cigarette
or
two
and
at
last
went
to
his
room
ferdinand
attended
him
and
the
concerned
expression
on
the
old
servant
s
face
showed
though
he
tried
to
repress
it
an
anxiety
as
to
the
very
evident
trouble
that
was
brewing
but
he
made
no
intrusive
remark
or
implication
though
a
furtive
glance
at
his
master
betokened
a
resentment
of
his
treatment
of
eunice
the
idol
of
ferdinand
s
heart
dismissed
he
left
embury
s
room
and
closed
the
door
softly
behind
him
the
door
between
the
rooms
of
embury
and
his
wife
stood
a
little
ajar
and
as
his
hand
fell
on
it
to
shut
it
he
heard
a
stifled
gasp
of
sanford
he
looked
in
and
saw
eunice
in
a
very
white
heat
of
rage
in
all
their
married
life
he
had
never
seen
her
so
terribly
angry
as
she
looked
then
speechless
from
very
fury
she
stood
with
clenched
hands
trying
to
command
her
voice
she
looked
wonderfully
beautiful
like
some
statue
of
an
avenging
angel
he
almost
fancied
he
could
see
a
flaming
sword
as
he
looked
she
took
a
step
toward
him
her
eyes
burning
with
a
glance
of
hate
judith
might
have
looked
so
or
jael
not
exactly
frightened
but
alarmed
lest
she
might
fly
into
a
passion
of
rage
that
would
really
injure
her
embury
closed
the
door
practically
in
her
very
face
indeed
practically
he
slammed
it
with
all
the
audible
implication
of
which
a
slammed
door
is
capable
the
next
morning
ferdinand
waited
for
the
usual
summons
from
embury
s
bedroom
the
tea
tray
was
ready
the
toast
crisp
and
hot
but
the
summons
of
the
bell
was
unusually
delayed
when
the
clock
pointed
to
fifteen
minutes
past
the
hour
ferdinand
tapped
on
embury
s
door
a
few
moments
later
he
tapped
again
rapping
louder
several
such
attempts
brought
no
response
and
the
valet
tried
the
door
it
would
not
open
so
ferdinand
went
to
eunice
s
door
and
knocked
there
jumping
from
her
bed
and
throwing
a
kimono
round
her
eunice
opened
her
own
door
ferdinand
started
at
sight
of
her
white
face
but
recovered
himself
and
said
mr
embury
ma
am
he
doesn
t
answer
my
knock
can
he
be
ill
oh
i
guess
not
eunice
tried
to
speak
casually
but
miserably
failed
go
through
that
she
pointed
to
the
door
between
her
room
and
her
husband
s
ferdinand
hesitated
you
open
it
embury
please
he
said
and
his
voice
shook
why
ferdinand
what
do
you
mean
open
that
door
yes
ma
am
and
turning
the
knob
ferdinand
entered
why
he
s
still
asleep
he
exclaimed
shall
i
wake
him
yes
that
is
yes
of
course
wake
him
up
the
door
on
the
other
side
of
eunice
s
room
opened
and
aunt
abby
put
her
head
in
what
s
the
matter
what
s
ferdinand
doing
in
your
room
eunice
are
you
ill
no
aunt
abby
but
eunice
got
no
further
she
sank
back
on
her
bed
and
buried
her
face
in
the
pillows
get
up
embury
it
s
late
ferdinand
was
saying
and
then
he
lightly
touched
the
arm
of
his
master
he
he
oh
miss
eunice
oh
my
god
why
ma
am
he
he
looks
to
be
dead
with
a
shriek
eunice
raised
her
head
a
moment
and
then
flung
it
down
on
the
pillows
again
crying
i
don
t
believe
it
you
don
t
know
what
you
re
saying

t
be
so

and
aunt
abby
leaned
over
the
silent
figure
what

was
perfectly
well
when
he
went
to
bed

must
put
on
a
aunt
abby
flew
to
her
bedroom
and
returned
quickly
wearing
a
lace
cap
eunice
had
given
her
and
talking
as
she
adjusted
it
it
must
be
a
stroke
and
yet
people
don
t
have
strokes
at
his
age
it
can
t
be
apoplexy
he
isn
t
that
build
and
too
he
s
such
an
athlete
there
s
nothing
the
matter
with
him
it
can
t
be
oh
mercy
gracious
it
can

sanford

course
not

just
now
before

election
no
of
course
he
wouldn
t
but
it
can
t
be
oh
lord
what
can
it
be
chapter
vii
a
vision
i
have
never
been
so
mystified
in
all
my
life
harper
spoke
in
a
perplexed
worried
way
and
a
puzzled
frown
drew
his
shaggy
eyebrows
together
though
the
family
physician
of
most
of
the
tenants
of
the
large
apartment
house
he
was
of
the
old
school
type
and
had
the
kindly
sociable
ways
of
a
smalltown
practitioner
i
know
sanford
embury
bone
blood
and
muscle
he
said
i
ve
not
only
been
his
physician
for
two
years
but
i
ve
examined
him
watched
him
and
kept
him
in
pink
of
condition
for
his
athletic
work
if
i
hadn
t
looked
after
him
he
might
have
overdone
his
athletics
but
he
didn
t
he
used
judgment
and
was
more
than
willing
to
follow
my
advice
result
he
was
in
the
most
perfect
possible
physical
shape
in
every
particular
he
could
no
more
have
had
a
stroke
of
apoplexy
or
paralysis
than
a
young
oak
tree
could
and
there
s
no
indication
of
such
a
thing
either
a
man
can
t
die
of
a
stroke
of
any
sort
without
showing
certain
symptoms
none
of
these
are
present
there
s
nothing
present
to
hint
the
cause
of
his
death
there
s
no
cut
scratch
or
mark
of
any
description
there
s
no
suggestion
of
strangulation
or
heart
failure
well
it
s
the
strangest
thing
i
ever
ran
up
against
in
all
my
years
of
practice
the
doctor
sat
at
the
embury
breakfast
table
heartily
partaking
of
the
dishes
ferdinand
offered
he
had
prescribed
aromatic
ammonia
for
eunice
and
a
cup
of
coffee
for
miss
ames
and
then
he
had
made
a
careful
examination
of
sanford
embury
s
mortal
body
upon
its
conclusion
he
had
insisted
that
the
ladies
join
him
at
breakfast
and
he
saw
to
it
that
they
made
more
than
a
pretense
of
eating
you
ve
a
hard
day
ahead
of
you
he
said
in
his
gentle
paternal
way
and
you
must
be
fortified
as
far
as
possible
i
may
seem
harsh
embury
but
i
m
going
to
ask
you
to
be
as
brave
as
you
can
right
now
at
first
as
i
may
say
and
then
indulge
in
the
luxury
of
tears
later
on
this
sounds
brutal
i
daresay
but
i
ve
a
reason
dear
madam
there
s
a
mystery
here
i
don
t
go
so
far
as
to
say
there
s
anything
wrong
but
there
s
a
very
mysterious
death
to
be
looked
into
and
as
your
physician
and
your
friend
i
want
to
advise
to
urge
you
to
keep
up
your
strength
for
what
may
be
a
trying
ordeal
in
the
first
place
i
apprehend
an
autopsy
will
be
advisable
and
i
trust
you
will
give
your
consent
to
oh
no
cried
eunice
her
face
drawn
with
dismay
not
that
now
now
be
reasonable
embury
i
know
you
dislike
the
idea
most
people
do
but
i
think
i
shall
have
to
insist
upon
but
you
can
t
do
it
unless
i
agree
can
you
and
eunice
looked
at
him
sharply
no
but
i
m
sure
you
will
i
won
t
i
never
will
you
shan
t
touch
sanford
i
won
t
allow
she
s
right
declared
aunt
abby
i
can
t
see
doctor
why
it
is
necessary
to
have
a
postmortem
i
don
t
approve
of
such
things
surely
you
can
somehow
discover
what
embury
died
of
and
if
not
what
matter
he
s
dead
and
nothing
can
change
that
it
doesn
t
seem
to
me
that
we
have
to
know
pardon
me
miss
ames
it
is
necessary
that
i
should
know
the
cause
of
the
death
i
can
not
make
a
report
until
well
you
can
find
out
i
should
i
never
heard
of
a
doctor
who
couldn
t
determine
the
cause
of
a
simple
natural
death
of
one
of
his
own
patients
eunice
s
glance
was
scathing
and
her
tones
full
of
scorn
but
the
doctor
realized
the
nervous
tension
she
was
under
and
forbore
to
take
offense
or
to
answer
her
sharply
well
well
we
ll
see
about
it
he
temporized
i
shall
first
call
in
marsden
a
colleague
of
mine
in
consultation
i
admit
i
m
at
the
end
of
my
own
knowledge
tell
me
the
details
of
last
evening
was
embury
just
as
usual
so
far
as
you
noticed
of
course
he
was
said
eunice
biting
the
words
off
crisply
he
went
to
the
athletic
club
he
s
a
candidate
for
the
presidency
i
know
i
know
and
i
i
was
at
a
party
on
his
way
from
the
club
he
called
for
me
and
brought
me
home
in
our
car
then
he
went
to
bed
almost
at
once
and
so
did
that
s
you
heard
no
sound
from
him
whatever
during
the
night
as
nearly
as
i
can
judge
he
died
about
daybreak
but
it
is
impossible
to
say
positively
as
to
that
especially
as
i
can
not
find
the
immediate
cause
of
death
you
heard
nothing
during
the
night
miss
ames
i
did
and
i
didn
t
was
the
strange
reply
just
what
does
that
mean
and
doctor
harper
looked
at
her
curiously
well
and
aunt
abby
spoke
very
solemnly
sanford
appeared
to
me
in
a
vision
just
as
he
died
oh
aunt
abby
eunice
groaned
don
t
begin
that
sort
of
talk
miss
ames
is
a
sort
of
a
spiritualist
doctor
and
she
has
not
hallucinations
visions
corrected
the
old
lady
and
it
is
not
an
unheard
of
phenomenon
to
have
a
dying
person
appear
to
a
friend
at
the
moment
of
death
it
was
the
passing
of
sanford
and
i
did
see
him
eunice
rose
and
left
the
table
her
shattered
nerves
couldn
t
stand
this
to
her
mind
foolishness
at
the
moment
she
went
from
the
into
the
livingroom
and
stood
gazing
out
of
the
window
but
seeing
nothing
harper
pushed
back
his
chair
from
the
table
just
a
word
more
about
that
miss
ames
he
said
i
m
rather
interested
in
those
matters
myself
you
thought
you
saw
embury
i
did
see
him
it
was
a
vague
shadowy
form
but
i
recognized
him
he
came
into
my
room
from
eunice
s
room
he
paused
at
my
bedside
and
leaned
over
me
as
if
for
a
farewell
he
said
nothing
and
in
a
moment
he
disappeared
but
i
know
it
was
sanford
s
spirit
taking
this
is
interesting
but
i
can
t
discuss
it
further
now
i
have
heard
of
such
cases
but
never
so
directly
but
my
duty
now
is
to
embury
i
fear
she
will
have
a
nervous
breakdown
may
i
ask
you
miss
ames
not
to
talk
about
you
your
vision
to
her
i
think
it
disturbs
don
t
you
tell
me
doctor
what
to
talk
to
eunice
about
and
what
not
to
i
brought
up
that
girl
from
a
baby
and
i
know
her
clear
through
if
it
upsets
her
nerves
to
hear
about
my
experience
last
night
of
course
i
shall
not
talk
about
it
to
her
but
trust
me
please
to
know
what
is
best
to
do
about
that
peppery
women
both
of
them
was
harper
s
mental
comment
but
he
only
nodded
his
head
pleasantly
and
went
to
eunice
if
you
ve
no
objections
i
ll
call
marsden
here
at
once
he
said
already
taking
up
the
telephone
eunice
listlessly
acquiesced
and
then
the
doctor
returned
to
embury
s
bedroom
he
looked
carefully
about
all
the
details
of
the
room
the
position
of
clothing
the
opened
book
face
down
on
the
night
table
the
the
penciled
memorandum
on
the
chiffonier
all
seemed
to
bear
witness
to
the
well
strong
man
who
expected
to
rise
and
go
about
his
day
as
usual
not
a
chance
of
suicide
mused
the
doctor
hunting
about
the
room
and
scrutinizing
its
handsome
appointments
he
stepped
into
embury
s
bathroom
and
could
find
nothing
that
gave
him
the
least
hint
of
anything
unusual
in
the
man
s
life
a
chart
near
the
white
enameled
scale
showed
that
embury
had
recorded
his
weight
the
night
before
in
his
regular
methodical
way
the
written
figures
were
clear
and
firm
as
always
positively
the
man
had
no
premonition
of
his
swiftly
approaching
end
what
could
have
caused
it
what
could
have
snapped
short
the
life
thread
of
this
strong
sound
specimen
of
human
vitality
harper
could
find
no
possible
answer
and
he
was
glad
to
hear
ferdinand
s
voice
as
he
announced
the
arrival
of
marsden
the
two
men
held
earnest
consultation
the
newcomer
was
quite
as
much
mystified
as
his
colleague
and
they
marveled
together
autopsy
of
course
said
marsden
finally
the
widow
must
be
brought
to
consent
why
does
she
object
so
strongly
i
don
t
know
of
any
reason
except
the
usual
dislike
the
members
of
the
family
feel
toward
it
i
ve
no
doubt
she
will
agree
when
you
advise
eunice
embury
did
agree
but
it
was
only
after
the
strenuous
insistence
of
marsden
she
flew
into
a
rage
at
first
and
the
doctor
who
was
unacquainted
with
her
wondered
at
her
fiery
exhibition
of
temper
and
but
for
the
arrival
of
mason
elliott
on
the
scene
she
might
have
resisted
longer
elliott
had
telephoned
wishing
to
consult
embury
on
some
matter
and
ferdinand
s
incoherent
and
emotional
words
had
brought
out
the
facts
so
of
course
elliott
had
come
right
over
to
the
house
what
is
it
eunice
he
asked
as
he
entered
seeing
her
fiercely
quarreling
with
the
doctors
let
me
help
you
advise
you
poor
child
you
ought
to
be
in
his
kindly
assertive
voice
calmed
her
and
turning
her
sad
eyes
to
him
she
moaned
plaintively
don
t
let
them
do
it
they
mustn
t
do
do
what
elliott
turned
to
the
doctors
and
soon
was
listening
to
the
whole
strange
story
certainly
an
autopsy
he
declared
why
it
s
the
only
thing
to
do
hush
eunice
make
no
further
objection
it
s
absolutely
necessary
give
your
consent
at
almost
as
if
hypnotized
eunice
embury
gave
her
consent
and
the
two
doctors
went
away
together
tell
me
all
about
it
said
elliott
all
you
know
and
then
he
saw
how
weak
and
unnerved
eunice
was
and
he
quickly
added
no
not
now
go
and
lie
down
for
a
time
where
s
miss
ames
here
and
aunt
abby
reappeared
from
her
room
yes
go
and
lie
down
eunice
maggie
has
made
up
our
rooms
and
your
bed
is
in
order
go
dear
i
don
t
want
to
and
eunice
s
eyes
looked
unusually
large
and
bright
i
m
not
the
sort
of
woman
who
can
cure
everything
by
lying
down
i
d
rather
talk
mason
what
happened
to
sanford
i
don
t
know
eunice
it
s
the
strangest
thing
i
ever
heard
of
if
you
want
to
talk
really
tell
me
what
occurred
last
night
did
you
two
have
a
quarrel
yes
we
did
eunice
looked
defiant
rather
than
penitent
but
that
couldn
t
have
done
it
i
mean
we
didn
t
quarrel
so
violently
that
san
burst
a
or
that
sort
of
thing
of
course
not
in
that
case
the
doctors
would
know
that
s
the
queerest
thing
to
me
a
man
dies
and
two
physicians
can
t
say
what
killed
him
but
what
difference
does
it
make
mason
i
m
sure
i
don
t
care
what
he
died
of
i
mean
i
don
t
want
him
all
cut
up
to
satisfy
the
curiosity
of
those
inquisitive
doctors
it
isn
t
that
eunice
they
have
to
know
the
cause
to
make
out
a
death
why
do
they
have
to
make
it
out
we
all
know
he
s
the
law
requires
it
the
bureau
of
vital
statistics
must
be
notified
and
must
be
told
the
cause
of
death
try
to
realize
that
these
matters
are
important
you
can
not
put
your
own
personal
preferences
above
them
leave
it
to
me
eunice
i
ll
take
charge
and
look
after
all
the
details
poor
old
san
i
can
t
realize
it
he
was
so
big
and
strong
and
healthy
and
so
full
of
life
and
vitality
and
by
jove
eunice
think
of
the
election
though
a
warm
friend
of
embury
it
was
characteristic
of
elliott
that
his
thoughts
should
fly
to
the
consequences
of
the
tragic
death
outside
the
family
circle
he
was
silent
as
he
realized
that
the
removal
of
the
other
candidate
left
alvord
hendricks
the
winner
in
the
race
for
president
of
the
club
that
is
if
the
election
should
be
held
it
was
highly
probable
that
it
would
be
postponed
the
club
people
ought
to
be
notified
at
once
hendricks
ought
to
be
told
i
say
eunice
there
s
lots
of
things
to
do
i
think
i
ought
to
telephone
the
club
and
several
people
do
you
mind
no
of
course
not
do
whatever
is
right
mason
i
m
so
glad
to
have
you
here
it
takes
a
load
of
responsibility
off
of
me
you
re
a
tower
of
then
do
what
you
can
to
help
me
eunice
try
won
t
you
to
be
quiet
and
calm
don
t
get
so
wrought
up
over
these
things
that
are
unpleasant
but
unavoidable
i
don
t
underrate
your
grief
or
your
peculiarly
hard
position
the
nervous
shock
is
enough
to
make
you
ill
but
try
to
control
yourself
that
s
a
goody
i
will
mason
honest
i
soon
after
noon
hendricks
arrived
he
had
returned
from
boston
on
an
early
morning
train
and
hearing
of
the
tragedy
came
at
once
to
the
embury
home
at
sight
of
his
grave
sympathetic
face
eunice
burst
into
tears
the
first
she
had
been
able
to
shed
and
they
were
a
real
relief
to
her
overburdened
heart
oh
alvord
she
cried
hysterically
now
you
can
be
president
hush
hush
eunice
dear
he
soothed
her
don
t
let
s
speak
of
that
now
i
m
just
in
from
boston
i
hurried
over
as
soon
as
i
heard
tell
me
somebody
not
you
eunice
you
tell
me
aunt
abby
how
it
that
s
the
strange
part
said
elliott
who
was
sitting
at
the
telephone
and
was
at
the
moment
waiting
for
a
response
to
a
call
the
doctors
can
t
tell
what
ailed
sanford
what
can
t
tell
what
made
him
die
no
aunt
abby
took
up
the
tale
as
elliott
turned
back
to
the
telephone
and
i
think
it
s
very
queer
did
you
ever
know
a
man
to
die
alvord
and
nobody
be
able
to
tell
what
killed
him
i
certainly
never
did
what
had
he
eaten
oh
it
s
nothing
like
that
eunice
spoke
up
it
must
be
that
something
gave
way
his
heart
or
lungs
never
sanford
was
a
sound
as
a
dollar
that
s
what
harper
says
they
re
they
re
going
to
have
an
of
course
we
d
never
be
satisfied
without
that
they
ll
find
the
cause
that
way
of
course
dear
eunice
i
m
so
sorry
for
it
s
awful
for
eunice
said
aunt
abby
the
excitement
and
the
mystery
oh
alvord
do
let
me
tell
you
what
i
saw
what
he
asked
with
interest
why
it
was
almost
dawn
just
beginning
to
be
daylight
and
you
know
harper
says
sanford
died
about
daybreak
he
thinks
and
i
was
sort
of
between
asleep
and
awake
don
t
you
know
how
you
are
like
that
sometimes
and
i
saw
aunt
abby
if
you
re
going
to
tell
that
yarn
over
again
i
ll
go
away
i
can
t
stand
it
go
on
eunice
and
aunt
abby
spoke
gently
i
wish
you
would
go
to
your
room
and
lie
down
for
awhile
even
if
you
don
t
want
to
it
will
rest
your
to
her
surprise
eunice
rose
and
without
a
word
went
to
her
own
room
aunt
abby
sent
maggie
to
look
after
her
and
resumed
her
story
i
m
going
to
tell
you
alvord
for
i
must
tell
somebody
and
eunice
won
t
listen
and
mason
is
busy
telephoning
he
s
been
at
it
all
day
off
and
on
fire
away
aunt
abby
dear
hendricks
said
he
had
small
desire
to
hear
her
meandering
tales
but
he
felt
sorry
for
the
pathetic
face
she
showed
and
listened
out
of
sheer
charity
yes
it
was
near
dawn
and
i
was
sort
of
dozing
but
yet
awake
too
and
i
heard
a
step
no
not
a
step
just
a
sort
of
gliding
footfall
like
a
person
shufing
in
slippers
and
then
i
saw
a
vague
shadowy
shape
like
sanford
s
and
it
passed
slowly
through
the
room
not
stepping
more
like
floating
and
it
stopped
right
at
my
bedside
and
leaned
over
me
you
saw
this
well
it
was
so
dark
i
can
t
say
i
saw
it
but
i
was
i
don
t
know
how
to
describe
it
i
was
conscious
of
its
presence
that
s
all
and
you
think
it
was
sanford
s
ghost
don
t
put
it
that
way
al
it
was
sanford
s
spirit
leaving
the
earth
and
bidding
me
as
it
wafted
why
didn
t
he
bid
his
wife
hendricks
was
blunt
but
he
deemed
it
best
to
speak
thus
rather
than
to
encourage
the
ghost
talk
he
probably
tried
to
but
eunice
must
have
been
asleep
i
don
t
know
as
to
that
but
you
know
alvord
it
is
not
an
uncommon
thing
for
such
experiences
to
happen
why
there
are
thousands
of
authenticated
cases
authenticated
fiddlesticks
your
scorn
doesn
t
alter
the
truth
i
saw
him
i
tell
you
and
it
was
not
a
dream
or
my
imagination
i
really
saw
him
though
what
did
he
have
on
that
s
the
queer
part
not
his
usual
clothes
but
that
sort
of
a
jersey
he
wears
when
he
s
doing
his
oh
his
gym
suit
you
saw
it
plainly
not
so
very
plainly
but
i
felt
it
felt
it
what
are
you
talking
about
i
did
i
tell
you
he
leaned
over
me
and
i
put
out
my
hand
and
touched
his
arm
and
i
i
think
i
felt
a
tight
woolen
jersey
oh
you
think
you
did
well
that
s
all
right
then
but
you
mustn
t
say
you
felt
a
ghost
they
re
not
material
you
you
re
making
fun
of
me
alvord
but
you
mustn
t
i
know
more
about
these
things
than
you
do
why
shouldn
t
i
i
ve
made
a
study
of
them
i
ve
read
lots
of
books
and
been
to
lots
of
s√©ances
and
lectures
oh
i
know
it
was
a
manifestation
of
san
himself
well
aunt
abby
if
it
gives
you
any
comfort
to
think
it
was
why
just
keep
right
on
thinking
i
don
t
say
there
aren
t
such
happenings
i
only
say
i
don
t
believe
there
are
i
don
t
doubt
your
word
you
understand
but
i
can
t
make
my
hard
common
sense
take
it
in
my
mind
isn
t
built
that
way
did
you
hear
anything
i
heard
aunt
abby
paused
and
blushed
a
little
you
ll
laugh
i
know
but
i
heard
his
watch
ticking
oh
come
now
aunt
abby
that
s
a
little
too
much
i
can
t
help
smiling
at
that
for
i
m
sure
ghosts
don
t
carry
watches
and
anyway
not
in
a
gymnasium
suit
i
knew
you
d
jeer
at
it
but
i
did
hear
the
ticking
all
the
wasn
t
your
own
watch
under
your
pillow
oh
all
right
i
haven
t
a
word
to
but
it
wasn
t
any
watch
i
heard
it
was
a
different
sort
of
yes
of
course
it
was
ghosts
watches
have
a
peculiar
tick
of
their
own
alvord
stop
it
s
mean
of
you
to
poke
fun
at
me
forgive
me
do
i
apologize
it
was
mean
and
i
ll
stop
what
else
happened
nothing
aunt
abby
was
clearly
piqued
yes
tell
me
what
became
of
the
the
figure
why
it
disappeared
gradually
you
know
just
seemed
to
float
away
into
he
gave
you
no
message
not
in
words
no
they
rarely
do
but
the
appearance
the
visibility
is
the
usual
way
of
manifestation
i
m
glad
it
occurred
oh
i
m
awfully
sorry
sanford
is
dead
i
didn
t
mean
that
but
since
he
had
to
go
i
m
glad
he
bade
me
as
he
passed
well
i
m
glad
too
if
it
is
any
comfort
to
you
are
you
sure
eunice
had
no
such
experience
oh
no
if
she
had
she
d
have
told
me
she
hates
all
such
ideas
i
suppose
if
she
had
seen
sanford
as
i
did
she
would
have
become
a
believer
but
i
m
sure
she
didn
poor
eunice
she
is
terribly
broken
yes
of
course
they
were
so
devoted
they
had
a
tiff
now
and
then
but
that
was
because
of
eunice
s
quick
temper
she
flares
up
so
easily
aunt
abby
sighed
san
couldn
t
manage
her
at
i
know
poor
girl
i
don
t
blame
her
for
those
spasms
of
rage
she
can
t
help
it
you
know
and
she
s
improving
every
that
s
what
sanford
said
he
thought
he
helped
her
and
i
dare
say
he
did
but
sometimes
he
had
to
speak
pretty
sharply
to
her
just
as
one
would
to
a
naughty
that
s
what
she
is
bless
her
heart
just
a
naughty
child
we
must
be
very
considerate
of
her
now
aunt
abby
mustn
t
we
yes
indeed
she
is
sorely
to
be
pitied
she
adored
sanford
i
don
t
know
what
she
will
chapter
viii
the
examiner
when
after
the
autopsy
harper
announced
that
it
was
necessary
to
send
for
the
medical
chief
examiner
eunice
cried
out
why
what
do
you
mean
he
s
the
same
as
a
coroner
he
takes
the
place
of
the
coroner
nowadays
rejoined
harper
and
in
marsden
s
opinion
his
attendance
is
do
you
mean
sanford
was
murdered
eunice
whispered
her
face
white
and
drawn
we
can
t
tell
embury
it
is
a
most
unusual
case
there
is
absolutely
no
indication
of
foul
play
but
on
the
other
hand
there
is
no
symptom
or
condition
that
tells
the
reason
of
his
death
that
is
your
finding
marsden
yes
agreed
the
other
mr
embury
died
because
of
a
sudden
and
complete
paralysis
of
respiration
and
circulation
there
is
nothing
we
can
find
to
account
for
that
and
by
elimination
of
all
other
possible
causes
we
are
brought
to
the
consideration
of
poison
not
any
known
or
evident
poison
but
a
subtle
mysteriously
administered
toxic
agent
of
some
sort
you
must
be
crazy
and
eunice
faced
him
with
scornful
glance
and
angry
eyes
who
would
poison
my
husband
how
could
any
one
get
at
him
to
do
it
why
would
they
anyway
marsden
looked
at
her
curiously
those
questions
are
not
for
me
madame
he
said
a
little
curtly
i
shall
call
examiner
crowell
and
he
will
take
charge
of
the
he
s
the
same
as
a
coroner
i
won
t
have
him
eunice
declared
it
isn
t
for
you
to
say
marsden
was
already
at
the
telephone
the
course
of
events
makes
it
imperative
that
i
should
call
crowell
he
is
not
a
coroner
he
is
of
course
a
civil
service
appointee
and
as
such
in
authority
you
will
do
whatever
he
eunice
embury
was
silent
from
sheer
astonishment
never
before
had
she
been
talked
to
like
this
accustomed
to
dictate
to
give
orders
to
have
her
lightest
word
obeyed
she
was
dumfounded
at
being
overruled
in
this
fashion
the
men
took
in
the
situation
more
clearly
medical
examiner
exclaimed
hendricks
is
it
a
case
for
him
yes
returned
marsden
gravely
at
least
it
is
a
very
mysterious
death
mystery
implies
wrong
of
some
sort
had
embury
been
a
man
with
a
weak
heart
or
any
affected
organ
i
should
have
been
able
to
make
a
satisfactory
diagnosis
but
his
sound
perfect
condition
precludes
any
reason
for
this
sudden
death
it
must
be
looked
into
it
may
be
the
examiner
will
find
a
simple
logical
cause
but
i
admit
i
can
find
none
and
i
am
not
but
if
he
were
poisoned
began
hendricks
as
you
have
implied
surely
you
could
find
some
that
s
just
the
point
agreed
marsden
i
certainly
think
i
could
and
since
i
can
t
i
feel
it
my
duty
to
report
it
as
a
mysterious
and
to
me
inexplicable
you
re
right
said
elliott
if
you
can
t
find
the
cause
for
heaven
s
sake
get
somebody
who
can
i
don
t
for
a
minute
believe
it
s
a
murder
but
the
barest
suspicion
of
such
a
thing
must
be
set
at
rest
once
and
for
all
murder
ridiculous
but
get
the
examiner
by
all
means
so
eunice
s
continued
objections
were
set
aside
and
crowell
was
called
in
a
strange
little
man
the
examiner
proved
to
be
he
had
sharp
eyes
that
darted
from
one
person
to
another
and
seemed
to
read
their
very
thoughts
on
his
entrance
he
went
straight
to
eunice
and
took
her
hand
mrs
embury
he
said
positively
rather
than
interrogatively
do
not
fear
me
ma
am
i
want
to
help
you
not
annoy
impressed
by
his
magnetic
manner
and
his
encouraging
handclasp
eunice
melted
a
little
and
her
look
of
angry
scorn
changed
to
a
expression
of
greeting
miss
ames
my
aunt
she
volunteered
as
crowell
paused
before
aunt
abby
and
then
the
newcomer
spoke
to
the
two
doctors
already
present
was
introduced
to
elliott
and
hendricks
who
were
still
there
and
in
a
very
decided
manner
took
affairs
into
his
own
hands
yes
yes
he
chattered
on
i
will
help
you
embury
now
harper
this
is
your
case
i
understand
marsden
yours
too
yes
yes
mysterious
you
say
maybe
so
maybe
so
let
us
proceed
at
the
little
man
stood
nervously
teetering
up
and
down
on
his
toes
almost
like
a
schoolboy
preparing
to
speak
a
piece
now
if
you
please
now
he
looked
eagerly
toward
the
other
doctors
they
all
went
into
embury
s
room
and
closed
the
door
then
eunice
s
temporary
calm
forsook
her
it
s
awful
she
cried
i
don
t
want
them
to
bother
poor
sanford
why
can
t
they
let
him
alone
i
don
t
care
what
killed
him
he
s
dead
and
no
doctors
can
help
that
oh
alvord
can
t
you
make
them
let
san
alone
no
eunice
it
has
to
be
keep
quiet
dear
it
can
do
no
good
for
you
to
get
all
wrought
up
and
if
you
d
go
and
lie
down
for
heaven
s
sake
stop
telling
me
to
go
and
lie
down
if
one
more
person
says
that
to
me
i
shall
just
perfectly
fly
now
eunice
began
aunt
abby
it
s
only
for
your
own
good
dear
you
are
all
excited
and
nervous
of
course
i
am
who
wouldn
t
be
mason
she
looked
around
at
the
concerned
faces
i
believe
you
understand
me
best
you
know
i
don
t
want
to
go
and
lie
down
don
t
you
stay
where
you
are
child
elliott
smiled
kindly
at
her
of
course
you
re
nervous
and
upset
all
you
can
do
is
to
try
to
hold
yourself
together
and
don
t
try
that
too
hard
either
for
you
may
defeat
your
own
ends
thereby
just
wait
eunice
sit
still
and
they
all
waited
and
after
what
seemed
an
interminable
time
the
examiner
reappeared
and
the
other
two
doctors
with
him
well
well
crowell
began
his
restless
hands
twisting
themselves
round
each
other
now
be
quiet
embury
i
declare
i
don
t
know
how
to
say
what
i
have
to
say
if
you
sit
there
like
a
chained
tiger
go
on
eunice
now
seemed
to
usurp
something
of
crowell
s
own
dictatorship
go
on
crowell
well
ma
am
i
will
but
there
s
not
much
to
tell
our
principal
evidence
is
lack
of
evidence
what
do
you
mean
cried
eunice
talk
english
please
i
am
doing
so
there
is
positively
no
evidence
that
embury
was
poisoned
yet
owing
to
the
absolute
lack
of
any
hint
of
any
other
means
of
death
we
are
forced
to
the
conclusion
that
he
was
by
his
own
hand
asked
hendricks
his
face
grave
probably
not
you
see
sir
with
no
knowledge
of
how
the
poison
was
administered
with
no
suspicion
of
any
reason
for
its
being
administered
we
are
working
in
the
dark
i
should
say
so
exclaimed
elliott
black
darkness
i
call
it
are
you
within
your
rights
in
assuming
poison
entirely
it
has
to
be
the
truth
no
agent
but
a
swift
subtle
poison
could
have
cut
off
the
victim
s
life
like
crowell
was
now
walking
up
and
down
the
room
he
was
a
restless
nervous
man
and
under
stress
of
anxiety
he
became
almost
hysterical
i
don
t
know
he
cried
out
as
one
in
an
extremity
of
uncertainty
it
must
be
poison
it
must
have
been
murder
he
pronounced
the
last
word
in
a
gasping
way
as
if
afraid
to
suggest
it
but
forced
to
do
so
hendricks
looked
at
him
with
a
slight
touch
of
contempt
in
his
glance
but
seeing
this
harper
interjected
the
examiner
is
regretting
the
necessity
of
thrusting
his
convictions
upon
you
but
he
knows
it
must
be
yes
said
crowell
more
decidedly
now
i
have
had
cases
before
where
murder
was
committed
in
such
an
almost
undiscoverable
way
as
this
never
a
case
quite
so
mysterious
but
nearly
what
is
your
theory
of
the
method
asked
elliott
who
was
staggered
by
the
rush
of
thoughts
and
conclusions
made
inevitable
by
the
examiner
s
report
that
s
the
greatest
mystery
of
all
crowell
replied
he
was
quite
calm
now
apparently
it
was
concern
for
the
family
that
had
made
him
so
disturbed
poison
was
not
taken
by
way
of
the
stomach
that
is
certain
therefore
it
must
have
been
introduced
through
some
other
channel
but
we
find
no
trace
of
a
hypodermic
needle
how
utterly
ridiculous
eunice
exclaimed
her
eyes
blazing
with
scorn
how
could
any
one
get
in
to
poison
my
husband
why
we
lock
all
our
doors
at
night
we
always
yes
m
exactly
ma
am
crowell
began
rubbing
his
hands
again
and
now
please
tell
me
of
the
locking
up
last
night
as
usual
ma
am
as
usual
precisely
our
sleeping
rooms
are
those
three
she
pointed
to
the
bedrooms
when
they
are
locked
they
form
a
unit
by
themselves
quite
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
crowell
looked
interested
the
apartment
faced
on
park
avenue
and
being
on
the
corner
had
also
windows
on
the
side
street
front
enumerating
from
the
corner
and
running
south
were
the
the
large
and
the
reception
hall
directly
back
of
these
and
with
windows
on
a
large
court
were
the
three
bedrooms
eunice
s
in
the
middle
sanford
s
back
of
the
hall
and
aunt
abby
s
back
of
the
aunt
abby
s
room
was
ordinarily
eunice
s
boudoir
and
but
was
used
as
a
guest
chamber
on
occasion
these
three
bedrooms
as
was
shown
to
examiner
crowell
when
locked
from
the
inside
were
shut
off
by
themselves
although
allowing
free
communication
from
one
to
another
of
them
lock
with
keys
he
asked
no
eunice
replied
there
are
big
strong
on
the
inside
of
the
doors
i
mean
locks
that
fasten
themselves
when
you
shut
the
door
unless
you
have
previously
put
up
the
yes
i
see
and
crowell
looked
into
the
matter
for
himself
spring
catches
and
mighty
strong
ones
too
and
these
were
always
fastened
at
night
always
eunice
declared
mr
embury
was
not
afraid
of
burglars
but
it
was
his
habit
to
sleep
with
a
locked
door
and
he
couldn
t
get
over
then
and
the
little
eyes
darted
from
one
to
another
of
his
listeners
and
paused
at
aunt
abby
then
miss
ames
you
were
also
locked
in
each
night
with
your
niece
and
her
husband
safe
from
yes
and
aunt
abby
looked
a
little
startled
at
being
addressed
i
don
t
sleep
with
my
door
locked
at
home
and
it
bothered
me
at
first
but
you
see
my
room
has
no
outlet
except
through
embury
s
bedroom
so
as
the
door
between
her
room
and
mine
was
never
locked
it
really
made
little
difference
to
oh
is
that
the
way
of
it
and
crowell
rose
in
his
hasty
manner
and
dashed
in
at
eunice
s
door
this
the
middle
room
opened
on
the
right
to
the
boudoir
and
on
the
left
to
embury
s
room
the
latter
door
was
closed
and
crowell
turned
toward
the
boudoir
now
aunt
abby
s
bedroom
a
small
bed
had
been
put
up
for
her
there
and
the
room
was
quite
large
enough
to
be
comfortable
it
was
luxuriously
furnished
and
the
appointments
were
quite
in
keeping
with
the
dainty
tastes
of
the
mistress
of
the
house
crowell
darted
here
and
there
about
the
room
he
looked
out
of
the
rear
windows
which
faced
on
the
court
out
of
a
window
that
faced
on
the
side
street
peeped
into
the
bathroom
and
then
hurried
back
to
eunice
s
own
room
here
he
observed
the
one
large
window
which
was
a
triple
bay
and
which
of
course
opened
on
the
court
he
glanced
at
embury
s
closed
door
and
then
returned
to
the
and
again
faced
his
audience
nobody
came
in
from
the
outside
he
announced
the
windows
show
a
sheer
drop
of
ten
stories
to
the
ground
no
balconies
or
so
our
problem
resolves
itself
into
two
possibilities
embury
was
given
the
poison
by
someone
already
inside
those
locked
doors
or
the
doors
were
not
the
restless
hands
were
still
now
the
examiner
bore
the
aspect
of
a
who
had
exploded
his
missile
and
calmly
awaited
the
result
his
darting
eyes
flew
from
face
to
face
as
if
he
were
looking
for
a
criminal
then
and
there
he
sat
motionless
save
for
his
constantly
moving
eyeballs
and
for
a
moment
no
word
was
spoken
by
anyone
then
eunice
said
with
no
trace
of
anger
or
excitement
you
mean
some
intruder
was
concealed
in
there
when
we
went
to
bed
crowell
turned
on
her
a
look
of
undisguised
admiration
more
he
seemed
struck
with
a
sudden
joy
of
finding
a
possible
loophole
from
the
implication
he
had
meant
to
convey
i
never
thought
of
that
he
said
slowly
piercing
her
with
his
intent
gaze
it
may
be
but
embury
in
that
case
where
is
the
intruder
now
how
did
he
get
out
rubbish
cried
miss
ames
caustically
there
never
was
any
intruder
i
mean
not
in
our
rooms
ridiculous
of
course
the
doors
were
not
locked
they
were
unintentionally
left
open
i
don
t
believe
they
re
locked
half
the
time
and
your
intruder
came
in
through
these
other
yes
agreed
hendricks
that
must
have
been
the
way
of
it
crowell
if
you
re
sure
this
is
a
a
oh
it
isn
t
who
would
kill
embury
your
theory
presupposes
a
motive
what
was
it
robbery
is
anything
missing
nobody
could
answer
this
question
and
ferdinand
as
one
familiar
with
his
master
s
belongings
was
sent
into
the
room
of
death
to
investigate
unwillingly
and
only
after
a
repeated
order
the
man
went
no
ma
am
he
said
on
his
return
addressing
eunice
none
of
embury
s
things
are
gone
all
his
pins
and
are
in
their
boxes
and
his
watch
is
on
the
chiffonier
where
he
always
leaves
it
then
resumed
hendricks
what
motive
can
you
suggest
crowell
it
s
not
for
me
sir
to
go
so
far
as
that
i
see
it
this
way
i
m
positive
that
the
man
was
killed
by
foul
means
i
m
sure
he
was
poisoned
though
i
can
t
say
how
i
you
see
i
haven
t
been
medical
examiner
very
long
and
i
never
had
such
a
hard
duty
to
perform
before
but
it
is
my
duty
and
i
must
do
it
i
must
report
to
you
shan
t
eunice
flew
across
the
room
and
stood
before
him
her
whole
body
quivering
with
intense
rage
i
forbid
it
i
am
sanford
embury
s
wife
and
as
such
i
have
rights
that
shall
not
be
imposed
upon
i
will
have
no
police
dragged
into
this
matter
were
my
husband
really
murdered
which
of
course
he
was
not
i
would
rather
never
have
the
murderer
discovered
or
punished
than
to
have
the
degradation
the
horrors
of
a
police
case
the
infinite
scorn
with
which
she
brought
out
the
last
phrase
showed
her
earnestness
and
her
determination
to
have
the
matter
pushed
no
further
but
examiner
crowell
was
by
no
means
the
inefficient
little
man
he
looked
his
eyes
took
on
a
new
glitter
and
narrowed
as
they
looked
at
the
angry
woman
before
him
i
am
sorry
embury
he
said
gently
but
with
a
strong
decision
in
his
tone
but
your
wishes
can
not
be
considered
the
law
is
inexorable
the
mystery
of
this
case
is
deepened
rather
than
lessened
by
your
extraordinary
behavior
and
i
must
but
his
brave
manner
quailed
before
the
lightning
of
eunice
s
eyes
what
she
cried
you
defy
me
you
will
call
the
police
against
my
desire
my
command
you
will
not
sir
i
forbid
it
crowell
looked
at
her
with
a
new
interest
it
would
seem
he
had
discovered
a
new
species
of
humanity
doubtless
he
had
never
seen
a
woman
like
that
in
his
previous
experience
for
eunice
was
no
shrew
she
did
not
for
a
moment
lose
her
poise
or
her
dignity
indeed
she
was
rather
more
imperious
and
dominating
in
her
intense
anger
than
when
more
serene
but
she
carried
conviction
both
elliott
and
hendricks
hoped
and
believed
she
could
sway
the
examiner
to
her
will
aunt
abby
merely
sat
nodding
her
head
in
corroboration
of
eunice
s
speeches
yes
yes
that
s
so
she
murmured
unheeding
whether
she
were
heard
or
not
the
examiner
however
paid
little
attention
to
the
decrees
of
the
angry
woman
he
looked
at
eunice
curiously
even
admiringly
and
then
went
across
the
room
to
the
telephone
eunice
flew
after
him
and
snatched
the
instrument
from
his
hand
stop
she
cried
fairly
beside
herself
with
fury
you
shall
not
both
elliott
and
hendricks
sprang
from
their
chairs
and
harper
rose
to
take
care
of
eunice
as
an
irresponsible
patient
but
crowell
waved
them
all
back
sit
down
gentlemen
he
said
mrs
embury
think
a
minute
if
you
act
like
that
you
will
you
inevitably
will
draw
suspicion
on
yourself
i
don
t
care
she
screamed
better
that
than
the
the
publicity
the
shame
of
a
police
investigation
oh
sanford
my
husband
it
was
quite
clear
that
uppermost
in
her
disturbed
mind
was
the
dread
of
the
disgrace
of
the
police
inquiry
this
had
dulled
her
poignant
grief
her
horror
her
sadness
all
had
been
lost
in
the
immediate
fear
of
the
impending
unpleasantness
and
too
the
examiner
went
on
coldly
it
is
useless
for
you
to
rant
around
like
that
i
ll
simply
go
to
another
eunice
stepped
back
and
looked
at
him
more
in
surprise
than
submission
to
be
told
that
she
was
ranting
around
was
not
the
way
in
which
she
was
usually
spoken
to
moreover
she
realized
it
was
true
that
to
jerk
the
telephone
away
from
crowell
could
not
permanently
prevent
his
sending
his
message
she
tried
another
tack
i
beg
your
pardon
doctor
she
said
and
her
expression
was
that
of
a
sad
and
sorry
child
you
re
right
i
mustn
t
lose
my
temper
so
but
you
know
i
am
under
a
severe
mental
strain
and
something
should
be
forgiven
me
some
allowance
made
for
my
dreadful
position
yes
ma
am
oh
certainly
ma
am
crowell
was
again
nervous
and
restless
he
proved
that
he
could
withstand
an
angry
woman
far
better
than
a
supplicating
one
eunice
saw
this
and
followed
up
her
advantage
and
so
doctor
try
to
appreciate
how
i
feel
a
newlymade
widow
my
husband
dead
from
some
unknown
cause
but
which
i
know
is
not
murder
after
a
second
s
hesitation
she
pronounced
the
awful
word
clearly
and
you
want
to
add
to
my
terror
and
distress
by
calling
in
the
police
of
all
things
the
police
yes
ma
am
i
know
it
s
too
bad
but
my
duty
ma
am
your
duty
is
first
to
me
eunice
s
smile
was
dazzling
it
had
been
a
callous
heart
indeed
that
would
not
be
touched
by
it
to
you
ma
am
the
examiner
s
tone
was
innocence
itself
yes
eunice
faltered
for
she
began
to
realize
she
was
not
gaining
ground
you
owe
me
the
don
t
they
call
it
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
what
doubt
ma
am
why
doubt
as
to
murder
if
my
husband
died
a
natural
death
you
know
there
s
no
reason
to
call
the
police
and
as
you
re
not
sure
i
claim
that
you
must
give
me
the
benefit
of
your
doubt
and
not
call
now
ma
am
you
don
t
put
that
just
right
you
see
the
police
are
the
people
who
must
settle
that
doubt
it
s
that
very
doubt
that
makes
it
necessary
to
call
them
and
truly
ernbury
it
won
t
be
any
such
horrible
ordeal
as
you
seem
to
anticipate
they
re
decent
men
and
all
they
want
to
get
at
is
the
that
isn
t
so
eunice
was
angry
again
they
re
horrible
men
rude
unkempt
common
men
i
won
t
have
them
in
my
house
you
have
no
right
to
insist
on
it
they
ll
be
all
over
the
rooms
prying
into
everything
looking
here
there
and
all
over
they
ll
ask
impertinent
questions
they
ll
assume
all
sorts
of
things
that
aren
t
true
and
they
ll
wind
up
by
coming
to
a
positively
false
conclusion
alvord
mason
you
re
my
friends
help
me
out
don
t
let
this
man
do
as
he
threatens
listen
eunice
elliott
said
striving
to
quiet
her
we
can
t
help
the
necessity
crowell
sees
of
notifying
the
police
but
we
can
help
you
only
however
if
you
ll
be
sensible
dear
and
trust
to
our
word
that
it
can
t
be
helped
and
you
must
let
it
go
on
oh
hush
up
mason
your
talk
drives
me
crazy
alvord
are
you
a
broken
reed
too
is
there
nobody
to
stand
by
me
i
ll
try
and
hendricks
went
and
spoke
to
crowell
in
low
tones
a
whispered
colloquy
followed
but
it
soon
became
clear
that
hendricks
pleas
of
whatever
nature
were
unsuccessful
and
he
returned
to
eunice
s
side
nothing
doing
he
said
with
an
attempt
at
lightness
he
won
t
listen
to
reason
nor
to
bribery
and
corruption
this
last
was
said
openly
and
with
a
smile
that
robbed
the
idea
of
any
real
seriousness
and
then
crowell
again
lifted
the
telephone
and
called
up
headquarters
chapter
ix
hamlet
of
the
two
detectives
who
arrived
in
response
to
the
examiner
s
call
one
almost
literally
fulfilled
eunice
s
prophecy
of
a
rude
unkempt
common
man
his
name
was
shane
and
he
strode
into
the
room
with
a
bumptious
air
his
burly
frame
looking
especially
awkward
and
unwieldy
in
the
gentle
surroundings
his
companion
however
a
younger
man
named
driscoll
was
of
a
finer
type
and
showed
at
least
an
appreciation
of
the
nature
of
the
home
which
he
had
entered
we
re
up
from
the
homicide
bureau
shane
said
to
crowell
quite
ignoring
the
others
present
tell
us
all
you
in
the
fewest
possible
words
the
medical
examiner
did
this
and
shane
paid
close
attention
driscoll
listened
too
but
his
glance
instead
of
being
fixed
on
the
speaker
darted
from
one
to
another
of
the
people
sitting
round
he
noted
carefully
eunice
s
beautiful
angry
face
as
she
sat
looking
out
of
a
window
disdaining
any
connection
with
the
proceedings
he
watched
miss
ames
nervously
rolling
her
handkerchief
into
a
ball
and
shaking
it
out
again
mason
elliott
calm
grave
and
earnestly
attentive
alvord
hendricks
alert
eager
sharply
critical
and
in
the
background
ferdinand
the
butler
hovering
in
the
doorway
all
these
things
driscoll
studied
for
his
method
was
judging
from
the
manners
of
individuals
whereas
shane
gathered
his
conclusions
from
their
definite
statements
and
having
listened
to
crowell
s
account
shane
turned
to
eunice
and
said
bluntly
you
and
your
husband
good
friends
eunice
gasped
then
after
one
scathing
glance
she
deliberately
turned
back
to
the
window
and
neglected
to
answer
that
won
t
do
ma
am
said
shane
in
his
heavy
voice
which
was
coarse
and
uncultured
but
not
intentionally
rude
i
m
here
to
ask
questions
and
you
people
have
got
to
answer
em
mebbe
i
can
put
it
different
was
you
and
embury
on
good
terms
the
word
was
forced
from
eunice
s
scornful
lips
and
accompanied
by
an
icy
glance
meant
to
freeze
the
detective
but
which
utterly
failed
no
rows
or
disagreements
eh
shane
s
smile
was
unbearable
and
eunice
turned
and
faced
him
like
an
angry
thing
at
bay
i
forbid
you
to
speak
to
me
she
said
and
looked
at
shane
as
if
he
were
some
miserable
crawling
reptile
mason
will
you
answer
this
man
for
me
no
no
lady
shane
seemed
to
humor
her
i
must
get
your
own
word
for
it
don
t
you
want
me
to
find
out
who
killed
your
husband
don
t
you
want
the
truth
known
are
you
afraid
to
have
it
told
hey
shane
s
secret
theory
was
that
of
a
sort
of
third
degree
applied
at
the
very
beginning
often
scared
people
into
a
quick
confession
of
the
truth
and
saved
time
in
the
long
run
driscoll
knew
of
this
and
did
not
approve
let
up
shane
he
muttered
this
is
no
time
for
such
talk
you
don
t
know
anything
go
ahead
you
returned
shane
not
unwillingly
and
driscoll
did
of
course
we
must
ask
questions
embury
he
said
and
his
politeness
gained
him
a
hearing
from
eunice
she
looked
at
him
with
at
least
toleration
as
he
began
to
question
her
when
did
you
last
see
embury
alive
ma
am
last
night
replied
eunice
about
midnight
when
we
he
was
in
his
usual
health
and
spirits
you
have
two
bedrooms
door
between
open
or
shut
after
you
said
to
embury
locked
who
shut
mr
bang
it
sir
did
he
bang
it
shut
slam
it
mr
embury
was
a
yes
i
know
did
he
slam
that
door
n
he
did
and
driscoll
nodded
his
head
as
if
not
minding
eunice
s
stammered
denial
but
not
believing
it
either
now
as
he
closed
that
door
with
a
bang
ma
am
i
gather
that
you
two
had
a
well
say
a
little
tiff
a
quarrel
might
as
well
own
up
ma
am
it
ll
come
out
and
it
s
better
you
should
tell
me
the
i
am
not
accustomed
to
telling
anything
else
eunice
declared
holding
herself
together
with
a
very
evident
effort
mr
embury
and
i
had
a
slight
difference
of
opinion
but
not
enough
to
call
a
what
about
broke
in
shane
who
had
been
listening
intently
eunice
did
not
speak
until
elliott
advised
her
tell
all
eunice
it
is
the
best
we
had
a
slight
discussion
eunice
said
but
it
was
earlier
in
the
evening
we
had
spent
the
evening
out
embury
at
his
club
and
i
at
the
house
of
a
friend
we
came
home
together
embury
called
for
me
in
our
own
car
on
reaching
home
we
had
no
angry
words
and
as
it
was
late
we
retired
at
once
that
is
all
embury
closed
the
door
between
our
bedrooms
and
that
is
the
last
i
ever
saw
of
him
until
this
morning
she
did
not
break
down
but
she
seemed
to
think
she
had
told
all
and
she
ceased
speaking
and
then
he
was
dead
shane
mused
what
doctor
did
you
call
crowell
took
up
the
narrative
and
told
of
harper
and
marsden
who
were
not
now
present
he
told
further
of
the
mysterious
and
undiscoverable
cause
of
the
death
let
me
see
him
said
shane
rising
suddenly
most
of
this
man
s
movements
were
sudden
and
as
he
was
in
every
respect
awkward
and
uncouth
eunice
s
dislike
of
him
grew
momentarily
isn
t
he
dreadful
she
cried
as
the
two
detectives
and
the
medical
examiner
disappeared
into
embury
s
room
yes
agreed
hendricks
but
eunice
you
must
not
antagonize
him
it
can
t
do
any
good
and
it
may
do
harm
how
and
eunice
turned
her
big
wondering
eyes
on
hendrick
oh
it
isn
t
wise
to
cross
a
man
like
that
he
s
a
common
clod
but
he
represents
authority
he
represents
the
law
and
we
must
respect
that
fact
however
his
personal
manner
offends
all
right
alvord
i
understand
but
there
s
no
use
in
my
seeing
him
again
can
t
you
and
mason
settle
up
things
and
let
aunt
abby
and
me
go
to
our
rooms
no
eunice
hendricks
voice
was
grave
you
must
stay
here
and
too
they
will
go
through
your
room
my
room
my
bedroom
they
shan
t
i
won
t
have
it
mason
must
i
submit
to
such
horrible
things
now
eunice
dear
mason
elliott
spoke
very
gently
we
can
t
blink
matters
we
must
face
this
squarely
the
police
think
sanford
was
murdered
they
re
endeavoring
to
find
out
who
killed
him
to
do
their
duty
in
the
matter
they
have
to
search
everywhere
it
s
the
law
you
know
and
we
can
t
get
away
from
it
so
try
to
take
it
as
quietly
as
you
oh
my
oh
my
wailed
aunt
abby
that
i
should
live
to
see
this
day
a
murder
in
my
own
family
no
wonder
poor
sanford
s
troubled
spirit
paused
in
its
passing
to
bid
me
eunice
shrieked
aunt
abby
if
you
start
up
that
talk
i
shall
go
stark
staring
mad
hush
i
won
t
have
it
let
up
on
the
spook
stuff
miss
ames
begged
hendricks
our
poor
eunice
is
just
about
at
the
end
of
her
so
am
i
cried
aunt
abby
i
m
entitled
to
some
consideration
here
s
the
whole
house
turned
upside
down
with
a
murder
and
police
and
all
that
and
nobody
considers
me
it
s
all
eunice
then
with
a
softened
voice
she
added
and
lord
knows
she
s
got
enough
to
bear
yes
i
have
eunice
was
composed
again
now
but
i
can
bear
it
i
m
not
going
to
collapse
don
t
be
afraid
for
me
and
i
do
consider
you
aunt
abby
it
s
dreadful
for
you
for
both
of
eunice
crossed
the
room
and
sat
by
the
elder
lady
and
they
comforted
one
another
shane
came
back
to
the
here
s
the
way
it
is
he
said
gruffly
those
three
bedrooms
all
open
into
each
other
but
when
their
doors
that
open
out
into
these
here
other
rooms
are
locked
they
re
quite
shut
off
by
themselves
and
nobody
can
get
into
em
now
that
last
room
the
one
the
old
lady
sleeps
in
that
don
t
have
a
door
except
into
embury
s
room
what
i
m
gettin
at
is
if
and
embury
s
room
doors
is
locked
not
meanin
the
door
between
then
those
three
people
are
locked
in
there
every
night
and
can
t
get
out
or
in
except
through
those
two
locked
doors
well
this
morning
where
s
that
butler
man
here
sir
and
ferdinand
appeared
promptly
and
with
his
usual
correct
demeanor
yes
you
now
this
morning
those
two
doors
to
the
sleeping
rooms
was
locked
i
understand
yes
sir
they
usually
what
happens
what
what
happens
sir
yes
what
s
your
first
duty
in
the
morning
does
embury
call
you
or
ring
for
you
oh
that
sir
why
generally
embury
unlocked
his
door
about
eight
o
clock
and
you
went
to
help
him
dress
no
sir
embury
didn
t
require
that
i
valeted
his
clothes
like
and
kept
them
in
order
but
he
dressed
by
himself
i
took
him
some
tea
and
toast
he
had
that
before
the
regular
breakfast
and
this
morning
when
he
didn
t
ring
or
make
any
sound
what
did
you
do
i
waited
a
little
while
and
then
i
rapped
at
embury
s
yes
and
she
now
be
careful
man
shane
s
voice
was
impressive
how
did
she
act
unusual
or
frightened
in
any
way
not
a
bit
sir
embury
was
surprised
and
when
i
said
embury
didn
t
answer
my
knock
she
let
me
go
through
her
room
to
exactly
and
then
you
found
your
master
dead
yes
now
what
is
your
name
yes
now
ferdinand
you
know
and
embury
had
a
quarrel
last
yes
the
trap
had
worked
shane
had
brought
about
the
admission
from
the
servant
that
eunice
had
refused
to
make
a
smile
of
satisfaction
settled
on
his
ugly
features
as
he
nodded
his
head
and
went
on
at
what
time
was
this
ferdinand
be
quiet
said
eunice
her
own
voice
low
and
even
but
her
face
was
ablaze
with
wrath
you
know
nothing
of
such
things
that
s
right
sir
i
don
clearly
the
butler
restored
to
his
sense
of
the
responsibilities
of
his
position
felt
he
had
made
a
misstep
and
regretted
it
be
quiet
madam
shane
hurled
at
eunice
and
turning
to
the
frightened
ferdinand
said
you
tell
the
truth
or
you
ll
go
to
jail
at
what
time
was
this
quarrel
that
you
have
admitted
took
place
eunice
stood
superbly
indifferent
looking
like
a
tragedy
queen
tell
him
ferdinand
tell
all
you
know
but
tell
only
the
yes
ma
am
yes
sir
why
it
was
just
before
they
went
ah
before
did
they
go
out
together
no
sir
embury
went
later
by
i
told
you
that
eunice
interposed
i
gave
you
a
detailed
account
of
the
you
omitted
the
quarrel
what
was
it
about
it
was
scarcely
important
enough
to
call
a
quarrel
my
husband
and
i
frequently
disagreed
on
trifling
matters
we
were
both
a
little
and
often
had
altercations
that
were
forgotten
as
soon
as
they
and
that
s
true
put
in
miss
ames
for
two
people
who
loved
each
other
to
distraction
i
often
thought
the
emburys
were
the
most
quarrelsome
i
ever
shane
looked
sharply
at
the
old
lady
is
that
so
he
said
did
you
hear
this
particular
quarrel
ma
am
not
that
i
remember
if
i
did
i
didn
t
take
much
notice
of
what
was
it
about
oh
the
same
old
subject
embury
wanted
aunt
abby
hush
what
are
you
talking
about
leave
me
to
tell
my
own
secrets
pray
secrets
ma
am
shane
s
cold
blue
eyes
glistened
who
s
talking
of
secrets
nobody
offered
hendricks
seems
to
me
shane
you
re
trying
to
frighten
two
nervous
women
into
a
confession
who
said
anything
about
a
confession
what
s
to
be
confessed
who
s
made
any
accusations
hendricks
was
silent
he
didn
t
like
the
man
shane
at
all
but
he
saw
plainly
that
he
was
a
master
of
his
craft
and
depended
on
his
sudden
and
startling
suggestions
to
rouse
antagonism
or
fear
and
so
gather
the
facts
he
desired
i
m
asking
nobody
s
secrets
he
went
on
except
in
so
far
as
i
m
obliged
to
by
reason
of
my
duty
and
in
that
connection
ma
am
i
ask
you
right
here
and
now
what
you
meant
by
your
reference
to
secrets
eunice
looked
at
him
a
moment
in
silence
then
she
said
you
have
i
daresay
a
right
to
ask
that
and
i
ve
not
the
least
objection
to
answering
embury
was
the
kindest
of
husbands
but
it
did
not
suit
his
ideas
to
give
me
what
is
known
as
an
allowance
this
in
no
way
reflects
on
his
generosity
for
he
insisted
that
i
should
have
a
charge
account
at
any
shops
i
wished
but
because
of
a
whim
i
often
begged
that
i
be
given
a
stated
and
periodical
allowance
this
i
have
no
reason
for
not
admitting
was
the
cause
of
most
of
our
this
is
what
i
should
prefer
to
keep
secret
but
not
if
it
is
for
any
reason
a
necessary
shane
looked
at
her
in
undisguised
admiration
fine
he
ejaculated
somewhat
cryptically
and
you
quarreled
about
this
last
night
last
evening
before
we
went
not
after
you
came
home
no
the
subject
was
not
then
h
m
and
you
two
were
as
friendly
as
ever
no
coolness
sorta
left
over
like
no
eunice
spoke
haughtily
but
the
crimson
flood
that
rose
to
her
cheeks
gave
the
lie
to
her
words
driscoll
came
in
i
ve
found
out
what
killed
embury
he
said
in
his
quiet
fashion
what
cried
the
examiner
and
shane
at
the
same
time
can
t
tell
you
just
yet
i
ll
have
to
go
out
on
an
errand
stay
here
all
of
you
till
i
get
the
dapper
little
figure
disappeared
through
the
hall
door
and
shane
turned
back
to
the
group
with
a
grunt
of
satisfaction
that
s
driscoll
all
over
he
said
put
him
on
a
case
and
he
don
t
say
much
and
he
don
t
look
like
he
s
doing
anything
and
then
all
in
a
minute
he
ll
bring
in
the
i
d
be
glad
to
hear
the
cause
of
that
death
said
crowell
musingly
i
m
an
old
experienced
practitioner
and
i
ve
never
seen
anything
so
mysterious
there
s
absolutely
no
trace
of
any
poison
and
yet
it
can
be
nothing
poison
s
a
mighty
sly
proposition
observed
shane
a
clever
poisoner
can
put
over
a
big
perhaps
your
assumption
of
murder
is
premature
said
hendricks
and
he
gave
shane
a
sharp
look
maybe
and
that
worthy
nodded
his
head
but
i
m
still
standing
pat
now
here
s
the
proposition
three
people
locked
into
a
suite
you
may
say
of
three
rooms
no
way
of
getting
in
from
this
side
those
locks
are
heavy
brass
that
can
t
be
worked
from
outside
no
way
either
of
getting
in
at
the
windows
apartment
and
the
windows
look
straight
down
to
the
ground
no
balconies
or
anything
like
that
unless
an
aryoplane
let
off
its
passengers
nobody
could
get
in
the
windows
well
then
we
have
those
three
people
shut
up
alone
there
all
night
in
the
morning
one
of
em
is
dead
poisoned
what
s
the
answer
he
stared
at
eunice
as
he
talked
it
was
quite
evident
he
meant
to
frighten
her
almost
to
accuse
her
but
with
her
strange
contradictoriness
she
smiled
at
him
you
have
stated
a
problem
shane
to
which
there
can
be
no
answer
therefore
that
is
not
the
problem
that
confronts
fine
talk
fine
talk
lady
but
it
won
t
get
you
anywhere
to
the
unbiased
logical
mind
the
answer
must
be
that
it
s
the
work
of
the
other
two
then
yours
is
not
a
logical
or
unbiased
mind
hendricks
flared
out
and
i
object
to
your
making
implications
if
you
are
making
accusations
do
so
frankly
and
let
us
know
where
we
stand
if
not
shut
up
shane
merely
looked
at
him
without
resenting
this
speech
the
detective
appeared
to
be
marking
time
as
he
awaited
the
return
of
his
partner
and
driscoll
returned
shortly
his
manner
betokened
success
in
his
quest
whatever
it
may
have
been
and
yet
he
looked
distressed
too
it
s
a
queer
thing
he
said
half
to
himself
as
he
fell
into
a
chair
shane
pushed
toward
him
mrs
embury
do
you
keep
an
engagement
book
why
yes
replied
eunice
amazed
at
the
question
put
to
her
let
me
see
it
eunice
went
for
it
and
returning
handed
the
detective
a
finely
bound
volume
hastily
he
ran
over
the
dates
looking
at
notes
of
parties
concerts
and
theatres
she
had
attended
recently
at
last
he
gave
a
start
read
over
one
entry
carefully
and
closed
the
book
abruptly
then
he
went
back
to
embury
s
room
asking
crowell
to
go
with
him
when
they
reappeared
it
was
plain
to
be
seen
the
mystery
was
solved
there
is
no
doubt
said
the
medical
examiner
that
sanford
embury
met
his
death
by
foul
play
the
means
used
was
the
administering
of
poison
through
the
ear
through
the
ear
repeated
elliott
as
one
who
failed
to
grasp
the
sense
of
the
words
yes
it
is
a
most
unusual
almost
a
unique
case
but
it
is
proved
beyond
a
doubt
the
poison
was
inserted
in
embury
s
ear
by
means
he
paused
and
driscoll
held
up
to
view
a
small
ordinary
glass
medicine
dropper
with
a
rubber
bulb
top
in
it
still
remained
a
portion
of
a
colorless
liquid
by
means
of
this
driscoll
declared
this
fluid
is
henbane
that
is
the
commercial
name
of
it
known
to
the
profession
however
as
hyoscyamus
or
hyoscyamine
this
little
implement
i
found
in
the
medicine
chest
in
miss
ames
no
no
screamed
aunt
abby
i
never
saw
it
before
i
don
t
think
you
did
said
driscoll
quietly
but
here
is
a
side
light
on
the
subject
this
henbane
was
used
in
this
very
manner
we
are
told
in
shakespeare
s
works
by
hamlet
s
uncle
when
he
poisoned
hamlet
s
father
he
used
the
play
says
distilled
hebenon
supposed
to
be
another
form
of
the
word
henbane
and
this
is
what
is
perhaps
important
embury
s
engagement
book
shows
that
about
a
week
ago
she
attended
the
play
of
hamlet
the
suggestion
there
received
the
presence
of
this
dropper
still
containing
the
stuff
the
finding
of
traces
of
henbane
in
the
ear
of
the
dead
man
seem
to
lead
to
a
conclusion
the
only
possible
conclusion
it
s
an
case
cried
shane
rising
and
striding
toward
eunice
mrs
embury
i
arrest
you
for
the
wilful
murder
of
your
husband
chapter
x
a
confession
don
t
you
dare
touch
me
eunice
embury
cried
stepping
back
from
the
advancing
figure
of
the
burly
detective
go
out
of
my
house
ferdinand
put
this
person
out
the
butler
appeared
in
the
doorway
but
shane
waved
a
dismissing
hand
at
him
no
use
blustering
embury
he
said
gruffly
but
not
rudely
you
d
better
come
along
quietly
than
to
make
such
a
i
shall
make
whatever
fuss
i
choose
and
i
shall
not
come
along
quietly
or
any
other
way
i
am
not
intimidated
by
your
absurd
accusations
and
i
command
you
once
more
to
leave
my
house
or
i
will
have
you
thrown
out
eunice
s
eyes
blazed
with
anger
her
voice
was
not
loud
but
was
tense
with
concentrated
rage
and
she
stood
one
hand
clenching
a
while
with
the
other
she
pointed
toward
the
door
be
quiet
eunice
said
mason
elliott
coming
toward
her
you
can
t
dismiss
an
officer
of
the
law
like
that
but
you
can
demand
an
explanation
i
think
shane
you
are
going
too
fast
you
haven
t
evidence
enough
against
embury
to
think
of
arrest
explain
yourself
no
explanation
necessary
she
killed
her
husband
and
she
s
my
hush
up
shane
let
me
talk
interrupted
driscoll
whose
calmer
tones
carried
more
authority
than
those
of
his
rough
partner
it
s
this
way
elliott
i
m
a
detective
and
i
saw
at
once
that
if
the
doctors
couldn
t
find
the
cause
of
embury
s
death
it
must
be
a
most
unusual
cause
so
i
hunted
for
some
clue
or
some
bit
of
evidence
pointing
to
the
manner
of
his
death
well
when
i
spied
that
little
medicine
dropper
half
full
of
something
i
didn
t
know
what
but
here
he
paused
impressively
but
there
was
no
bottle
or
vial
of
anything
in
the
cupboard
from
which
it
could
have
been
taken
there
was
no
fluid
in
there
that
looked
a
bit
like
the
stuff
in
the
dropper
so
i
thought
that
looked
suspicious
as
if
some
one
had
hidden
it
there
i
didn
t
see
the
whole
game
then
but
i
went
around
to
a
druggist
s
and
asked
him
what
was
in
that
dropper
and
he
said
henbane
he
further
explained
that
henbane
is
the
common
name
for
hyoscyamin
which
is
a
deadly
poison
now
the
doctors
were
pretty
sure
that
embury
had
not
been
killed
by
anything
taken
into
the
stomach
so
i
thought
a
minute
and
like
a
flash
i
remembered
the
play
of
hamlet
that
i
saw
last
week
i
guess
everybody
in
new
york
went
to
see
it
the
house
was
crowded
anyway
i
ve
proved
by
embury
s
engagement
book
that
she
went
one
afternoon
to
a
matinee
and
what
closer
or
more
indicative
hint
do
you
want
in
that
play
the
murder
is
fully
described
and
though
many
people
might
think
poison
could
not
be
introduced
through
the
intact
ear
in
sufficient
quantity
to
be
fatal
yet
it
can
be
and
i
read
an
article
lately
in
a
prominent
medical
journal
saying
so
i
was
interested
because
of
the
hamlet
play
if
i
hadn
t
seen
that
i
d
never
thought
of
this
whole
business
but
if
i
m
wrong
let
embury
explain
the
presence
of
that
dropper
in
her
medicine
i
don
t
know
anything
about
the
thing
i
never
saw
or
heard
of
it
before
i
don
t
believe
you
found
it
where
you
say
you
did
eunice
faced
him
with
an
accusing
look
you
put
it
there
yourself
it
s
what
you
call
a
i
know
nothing
of
your
old
dropper
there
there
lady
shane
put
in
don
t
get
excited
it
only
counts
against
you
driscoll
here
wouldn
t
have
no
reason
to
do
such
a
thing
as
you
speak
of
why
would
he
do
that
now
but
he
must
have
done
it
broke
in
miss
ames
for
i
use
that
bathroom
of
eunice
s
and
that
thing
hasn
t
been
in
it
since
i
ve
been
of
course
not
and
shane
looked
at
her
as
at
a
foolish
child
why
should
it
be
the
lady
used
it
and
then
put
it
hold
on
there
shane
hendricks
interrupted
why
would
any
one
do
such
a
positively
incriminating
thing
as
that
they
always
slip
up
somewhere
said
driscoll
after
committing
a
crime
your
criminal
is
bound
to
do
something
careless
that
gives
it
all
away
embury
how
did
that
dropper
get
in
that
medicine
chest
in
your
bathroom
i
scorn
to
answer
the
cold
tones
showed
no
fear
no
trepidation
but
eunice
s
white
fingers
interlaced
themselves
in
a
nervous
fashion
do
you
know
anything
about
it
miss
ames
n
no
stammered
aunt
abby
trembling
as
she
looked
now
at
the
detectives
and
then
at
eunice
well
it
couldn
t
have
put
itself
there
went
on
driscoll
who
else
has
access
to
that
place
eunice
gave
no
heed
to
this
speech
she
gave
no
heed
to
the
speaker
but
stared
at
him
unseeingly
her
gaze
seeming
to
go
straight
through
him
why
the
maid
said
aunt
abby
with
a
helpless
glance
toward
elliott
and
hendricks
as
if
beseeching
assistance
the
servants
must
be
considered
said
hendricks
catching
at
a
straw
they
may
know
something
that
will
call
the
maid
said
shane
briefly
and
as
neither
of
the
women
obeyed
he
turned
to
ferdinand
who
hovered
in
the
background
and
thundered
bring
her
in
you
maggie
appeared
shaken
and
frightened
but
when
questioned
she
answered
calmly
and
positively
i
put
that
dropper
in
the
medicine
closet
she
said
and
every
one
looked
toward
her
where
did
you
get
it
asked
shane
i
found
it
on
the
on
the
floor
where
beside
miss
ames
the
girl
s
eyes
were
cast
down
she
looked
at
nobody
but
gave
her
answers
in
a
dull
way
almost
as
if
she
had
rehearsed
them
before
when
this
morning
when
i
made
up
her
had
you
ever
seen
it
before
no
why
did
you
think
it
belonged
to
miss
ames
i
didn
t
think
anything
about
it
i
found
it
there
and
i
supposed
it
belonged
to
miss
ames
and
i
put
it
why
did
you
put
it
in
the
medicine
chest
the
girl
looked
up
surprised
that
seemed
to
me
the
proper
place
for
it
whenever
i
find
a
bottle
of
camphor
or
a
jar
of
cold
cream
or
anything
like
that
i
always
put
it
in
the
medicine
chest
that
s
where
such
things
belong
so
i
thought
it
was
the
right
place
for
the
little
dropper
did
i
do
wrong
no
maggie
driscoll
said
kindly
that
was
all
right
now
tell
us
exactly
where
you
found
i
did
tell
you
on
the
floor
just
beside
miss
ames
bed
near
the
head
of
the
well
miss
ames
i
guess
it
s
up
to
you
what
were
you
doing
with
this
thing
i
didn
t
have
it
at
all
i
never
saw
it
before
come
come
that
won
t
do
how
could
it
get
there
i
don
t
know
but
i
didn
t
put
it
the
old
lady
trembled
pitifully
and
looked
from
one
to
another
for
help
or
guidance
of
course
she
didn
t
cried
eunice
you
sha
n
t
torment
my
aunt
cease
questioning
her
talk
to
me
if
you
choose
and
as
you
choose
but
leave
miss
ames
alone
she
faced
her
inquisitors
defiantly
and
even
shane
quailed
a
little
before
her
scornful
eyes
well
ma
am
as
you
see
i
ain
t
got
much
choice
in
the
matter
here
s
the
case
you
and
your
aunt
and
embury
was
shut
in
those
three
rooms
nobody
else
could
get
in
come
morning
the
gentleman
is
dead
murdered
one
of
you
two
done
it
it
s
for
us
to
find
out
which
unless
the
guilty
party
sees
fit
to
i
do
i
confess
cried
aunt
abby
i
did
it
and
i
m
willing
to
go
to
prison
she
was
clearly
hysterical
and
though
her
words
were
positive
they
by
no
means
carried
conviction
now
that
s
all
bosh
declared
shane
you
re
sayin
that
ma
am
to
shield
your
niece
you
know
she
s
the
murderer
and
eunice
flew
at
shane
like
a
wild
thing
she
grasped
his
arm
and
whirled
him
around
toward
her
as
she
glared
into
his
face
quivering
with
indignation
coward
she
flung
at
him
to
attack
two
helpless
women
to
accuse
me
me
of
crime
why
i
could
kill
you
where
you
stand
for
such
an
insinuation
say
you
re
some
tiger
shane
exclaimed
in
a
sort
of
grudging
admiration
but
better
be
careful
of
your
words
ma
am
if
you
could
kill
me
ah
there
the
last
exclamation
was
brought
forth
by
the
sudden
attack
of
eunice
as
she
shook
the
big
man
so
violently
that
he
nearly
lost
his
balance
say
you
wildcat
be
careful
what
you
do
you
are
a
tiger
yes
aunt
abby
giggled
nervously
mr
embury
always
called
her
tiger
i
don
t
wonder
and
shane
stared
at
eunice
who
had
stepped
back
but
who
still
stood
like
a
wild
animal
at
bay
her
eyes
darting
angry
fire
now
embury
let
s
get
down
to
business
who
s
your
lawyer
i
am
declared
alvord
hendricks
i
am
her
counsel
i
represent
embury
eunice
say
nothing
more
leave
it
to
me
and
first
shane
you
haven
t
enough
evidence
to
arrest
this
lady
that
dropper
thing
is
no
positive
information
against
her
it
might
be
the
work
of
the
servants
or
some
intruder
the
story
of
that
housemaid
is
not
necessarily
law
and
gospel
remember
you
d
get
in
pretty
bad
if
you
were
to
arrest
sanford
embury
falsely
and
my
influence
with
your
superiors
is
not
entirely
negligible
you
re
doing
your
duty
all
right
but
don
t
overstep
your
authority
or
rather
don
t
let
your
desire
to
make
a
sensational
arrest
cloud
your
that
s
what
i
think
hendricks
said
driscoll
earnestly
we
ve
found
the
method
but
i
m
by
no
means
sure
we
ve
found
the
criminal
leastways
it
don
t
look
sure
to
me
eh
shane
clear
enough
to
me
the
big
man
growled
but
he
was
quite
evidently
influenced
by
hendricks
words
however
i
m
willing
to
wait
but
we
must
put
embury
under
surveillance
under
what
demanded
eunice
her
beautiful
face
again
contorted
by
uncontrollable
anger
i
will
not
be
watched
or
spied
upon
hush
eunice
begged
elliott
try
to
keep
yourself
calm
it
does
no
good
to
defy
these
men
they
are
not
really
acting
on
their
own
initiative
but
they
are
merely
carrying
out
their
duty
as
they
see
their
duty
is
to
find
out
who
killed
my
husband
and
eunice
gave
shane
another
stormy
glare
they
can
not
do
that
by
accusing
two
innocent
women
if
you
two
women
can
be
proved
innocent
nobody
will
be
more
glad
than
me
shane
announced
in
a
hearty
way
that
was
really
generous
after
eunice
s
treatment
of
him
but
it
beats
me
to
see
how
it
can
be
proved
you
admit
ma
am
nobody
could
get
into
embury
s
room
except
you
and
miss
ames
don
t
you
i
don
t
admit
that
at
all
for
the
murderer
did
get
in
and
did
commit
the
murder
therefore
there
must
be
some
means
of
access
oho
and
just
how
can
you
suggest
that
an
intruder
got
in
and
got
out
again
and
left
those
doors
fastened
on
the
inside
that
i
don
t
know
nor
is
it
my
business
to
find
maybe
you
think
a
flyin
machine
came
at
the
window
ma
am
for
nothin
else
could
negotiate
a
don
t
talk
nonsense
but
i
have
heard
of
keys
that
unlock
doors
from
the
outside
skeleton
keys
i
think
they
are
yes
ma
am
there
are
such
sure
but
they
re
keys
and
they
unlock
doors
these
doors
of
yours
have
strong
brass
catches
that
work
only
on
the
inside
they
are
and
when
they
re
fastened
nothing
from
the
other
side
of
the
door
could
undo
em
but
i
say
here
you
ferdinand
the
butler
came
forward
his
face
surprised
rather
than
alarmed
and
stood
at
attention
what
do
you
know
of
events
here
last
night
shane
asked
him
nothing
sir
and
ferdinand
s
face
was
blankly
respectful
you
d
better
tell
all
you
know
or
you
ll
get
into
could
you
could
you
make
your
question
a
little
more
definite
i
will
when
and
embury
came
home
last
night
were
they
in
good
humor
i
don
t
know
you
do
know
you
know
your
employers
well
enough
to
judge
by
their
manner
whether
they
were
at
odds
or
not
answer
me
man
well
sir
they
were
i
should
judge
a
little
at
oh
they
were
in
what
way
did
they
show
it
by
quarreling
no
how
then
by
not
saying
anything
but
it
s
not
uncommon
for
them
to
be
at
odds
sir
speak
when
you
re
spoken
to
after
embury
went
to
his
room
did
you
attend
him
i
was
in
his
room
mrs
embury
was
in
her
own
room
then
her
outer
door
was
closed
and
therefore
fastened
by
the
yes
i
suppose
don
t
you
know
so
don
t
you
know
that
it
must
have
been
and
then
then
when
you
left
embury
s
room
when
you
left
him
for
the
night
did
you
close
his
door
i
and
that
of
itself
locked
that
door
yes
i
suppose
stop
saying
you
suppose
so
you
know
it
did
you
ve
lived
in
this
house
two
years
you
know
how
those
doors
work
you
know
your
closing
that
door
locked
it
didn
t
it
yes
it
did
i
turned
the
knob
afterward
to
make
sure
i
always
do
ferdinand
now
seemed
to
be
as
discursive
as
he
was
reticent
before
and
i
know
miss
eunice
s
embury
s
door
was
locked
because
she
had
to
unbolt
it
before
i
could
get
in
this
but
look
here
driscoll
broke
in
are
these
doors
on
that
all
day
isn
t
that
rather
an
inconvenience
not
all
day
vouchsafed
ferdinand
they
can
be
turned
so
the
bolt
doesn
t
catch
and
are
turned
that
way
in
the
daytime
but
and
driscoll
looked
at
him
intently
you
can
swear
that
the
bolts
were
on
last
night
yes
sir
you
can
t
hendricks
shot
at
him
the
lawyer
had
been
listening
in
silence
but
he
now
refuted
ferdinand
you
don
t
know
that
embury
put
on
the
catch
of
her
door
when
she
closed
i
do
sir
i
heard
it
you
are
very
observant
said
shane
peculiarly
so
it
seems
to
no
sir
and
ferdinand
looked
thoughtful
but
you
see
it
s
this
way
every
night
i
hear
the
click
of
those
locks
and
it
sort
of
seems
natural
to
me
to
listen
for
it
if
it
should
be
forgotten
i
d
think
it
my
duty
to
call
attention
to
a
most
careful
butler
on
my
word
shane
s
tone
was
a
little
sneering
he
is
indeed
eunice
defended
and
i
can
assert
that
it
is
because
of
his
faithfulness
and
efficiency
that
we
have
always
felt
safe
at
night
from
intrusion
by
and
you
did
lock
your
door
securely
last
night
embury
i
most
assuredly
did
i
do
every
night
but
that
does
not
prove
that
i
killed
my
husband
nor
that
miss
ames
then
your
theory
i
have
no
theory
embury
was
killed
it
is
for
you
detectives
to
find
out
how
but
do
not
dare
to
say
or
imply
that
it
was
by
the
hand
of
his
wife
or
his
relative
she
glanced
fondly
at
miss
ames
and
then
again
assumed
her
look
of
angry
defiance
toward
the
two
men
who
were
accusing
her
it
is
for
you
to
find
out
how
said
mason
elliott
gravely
it
is
incredible
that
embury
is
the
guilty
one
though
i
admit
the
incriminating
appearance
of
the
henbane
but
i
ve
been
thinking
it
over
and
while
driscoll
s
surmise
that
the
deed
can
possibly
be
traced
to
one
who
recently
saw
the
play
of
hamlet
yet
he
must
remember
that
thousands
of
people
saw
that
play
and
that
therefore
it
can
not
point
exclusively
toward
that
s
so
agreed
driscoll
who
went
with
you
to
the
play
embury
my
aunt
miss
ames
also
a
friend
desternay
and
i
understand
you
went
yourself
driscoll
why
single
out
me
for
a
suspect
the
haughty
face
turned
to
him
was
quite
severely
critical
true
embury
why
should
i
the
answer
is
motive
you
must
admit
that
i
had
neither
motive
nor
opportunity
to
kill
your
husband
desternay
let
us
say
had
neither
opportunity
nor
motive
miss
ames
had
opportunity
but
no
motive
and
so
you
we
must
all
admit
are
the
only
human
being
who
had
both
opportunity
and
i
did
not
have
motive
eunice
flushed
back
you
talk
nonsense
i
have
had
slight
differences
of
opinion
with
my
husband
hundreds
of
time
but
that
is
not
a
motive
for
murder
i
have
a
high
temper
and
at
times
i
am
unable
to
control
it
but
that
does
not
mean
i
am
a
murderess
not
necessarily
but
it
gives
a
reason
for
suspecting
you
since
you
are
the
only
person
who
can
reasonably
be
but
hold
on
driscoll
don
t
go
too
fast
said
mason
elliott
there
may
be
other
people
who
had
motives
remember
sanford
embury
was
a
man
of
wide
public
interests
outside
of
his
family
affairs
suppose
you
turn
your
attention
to
that
sort
of
gladly
elliott
but
when
we
ve
proved
no
outsider
could
get
into
embury
s
room
why
look
for
outside
motives
it
seems
only
fair
to
my
mind
that
such
motives
should
be
looked
into
now
for
instance
embury
was
candidate
in
a
hotly
contested
coming
election
that
s
so
cried
hendricks
look
for
your
murderer
in
some
such
connection
as
election
to
what
growled
shane
president
of
the
metropolitan
athletic
club
a
big
organization
h
m
who
s
the
opposing
candidate
i
am
replied
hendricks
quietly
you
well
hendricks
where
were
you
last
night
when
this
man
was
killed
in
hendricks
did
not
smile
but
he
looked
as
if
the
question
annoyed
him
you
can
prove
that
yes
of
course
i
stayed
at
the
touraine
was
with
friends
till
well
after
midnight
and
took
the
seven
o
clock
train
this
morning
for
new
york
in
company
with
the
same
men
you
can
look
up
all
that
at
your
leisure
but
there
is
a
point
in
what
elliott
says
i
can
t
think
that
any
of
the
club
members
would
be
so
keen
over
the
election
as
to
do
away
with
one
of
the
candidates
but
there
s
the
situation
go
to
it
leaves
something
to
be
looked
into
at
any
rate
mused
shane
why
didn
t
you
think
of
it
for
yourself
said
hendricks
rather
scathingly
it
seems
to
me
a
detective
ought
to
look
a
little
beyond
his
nose
i
can
t
think
we
ve
got
to
in
this
case
shane
persisted
but
i
m
willing
to
try
also
embury
i
ll
ask
you
for
the
address
of
the
lady
who
went
with
you
to
see
that
certainly
said
eunice
in
a
cold
voice
and
gave
the
address
desired
and
now
we
ll
move
on
said
shane
rising
you
ain
t
under
arrest
embury
not
yet
but
i
advise
you
not
to
try
to
leave
this
house
without
permission
indeed
i
shall
whenever
and
as
often
as
i
choose
the
idea
of
your
forbidding
me
hush
eunice
said
hendricks
she
will
not
shane
i
m
her
guaranty
for
that
don
t
apprehend
any
insubordination
on
the
part
of
not
if
she
knows
what
s
good
for
herself
was
shane
s
parting
shot
and
the
two
detectives
went
away
chapter
xi
fifi
oh
yes
indeed
shane
embury
is
a
dear
friend
of
mine
a
very
very
dear
friend
and
i
d
so
gladly
go
to
see
her
and
comfort
her
console
with
her
and
try
to
cheer
her
up
but
well
i
asked
her
last
night
over
the
telephone
to
let
me
go
to
see
her
and
she
she
desternay
s
pretty
blue
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
her
pretty
lips
quivered
and
she
dabbed
a
sheer
little
handkerchief
here
and
there
on
her
countenance
then
she
took
up
her
babbling
again
oh
i
don
t
mean
she
was
unfriendly
or
or
cross
you
know
but
she
was
a
little
well
curt
almost
i
might
say
cool
and
i
m
one
of
her
dearest
friends
and
i
can
t
quite
understand
perhaps
you
must
make
allowances
for
embury
shane
suggested
remember
the
sudden
and
mysterious
death
of
her
husband
must
have
been
a
fearful
shock
oh
terrible
yes
indeed
i
do
appreciate
all
that
and
of
course
when
i
telephoned
last
evening
she
had
just
had
that
long
interview
with
you
and
your
other
detective
what
and
oh
yes
elliott
answered
my
call
and
he
told
me
just
how
things
were
but
i
did
think
dear
eunice
would
want
to
see
me
but
it
s
all
right
of
course
if
she
doesn
t
want
my
sympathy
i
m
the
last
one
to
intrude
on
her
grief
but
she
has
no
one
no
one
at
all
except
that
old
aunt
who
s
half
foolish
i
think
what
do
you
mean
half
foolish
oh
she
s
hipped
over
those
psychic
studies
of
hers
and
she
s
all
wrapped
up
in
spiritualism
and
occult
thingamajigs
i
don
t
know
what
you
call
she
seems
to
me
a
very
sane
and
practical
in
most
ways
yes
but
crazy
on
the
subject
of
spooks
and
mediums
and
things
like
that
oh
shane
who
do
you
suppose
killed
embury
how
awful
to
have
a
real
murder
right
in
one
s
owns
circle
of
acquaintances
i
had
almost
said
friends
but
dear
eunice
doesn
t
seem
to
look
on
me
as
her
friend
the
blue
eyes
made
a
bid
for
sympathy
and
shane
though
not
always
at
ease
in
the
presence
of
society
ladies
met
her
half
way
now
that
s
a
pity
desternay
i
m
sure
you
d
be
the
greatest
help
to
her
in
her
fifi
desternay
raised
her
hands
and
let
them
fall
with
a
pretty
little
gesture
of
helplessness
she
was
a
slip
of
a
thing
and
it
was
the
morning
of
the
day
after
the
embury
tragedy
she
was
garbed
in
a
scant
but
becoming
negligee
and
had
received
the
detective
in
her
morning
room
where
she
sat
tucked
into
the
corner
of
a
great
davenport
sofa
smoking
cigarettes
her
little
face
was
delicately
made
up
and
her
soft
fair
hair
was
in
blobs
over
her
ears
for
the
rest
the
effect
was
mostly
a
rather
low
v
d
neck
and
somewhat
evident
silk
stockings
and
beribboned
mules
she
continually
pulled
her
narrow
satin
gown
about
her
and
it
as
continually
slipped
away
from
her
lace
petticoat
as
she
crossed
and
recrossed
her
silken
legs
she
was
entirely
and
yet
the
detective
felt
instinctively
that
she
carefully
measured
every
one
of
the
words
she
so
carelessly
uttered
well
shane
she
said
suddenly
we
re
not
getting
anywhere
just
exactly
what
did
you
come
here
for
what
do
you
want
of
me
the
detective
was
grateful
for
this
assistance
i
came
he
stated
without
hesitation
to
ask
you
about
the
circumstances
of
the
party
which
embury
attended
here
night
before
last
the
night
her
husband
oh
yes
let
me
see
there
isn
t
much
to
tell
eunice
embury
spent
the
evening
here
we
had
a
game
of
cards
and
before
supper
was
served
embury
called
for
her
and
took
her
home
in
their
car
that
s
all
i
know
about
what
was
the
card
game
for
high
stakes
oh
mercy
no
we
never
really
gamble
the
fluttering
little
hands
deprecated
the
very
idea
we
have
just
a
tiny
stake
to
why
only
to
make
us
play
a
better
game
it
does
you
yes
m
and
what
do
you
call
a
tiny
stake
opinions
differ
you
and
so
do
stakes
the
blue
eyes
flashed
a
warning
of
course
we
don
t
always
play
for
the
same
indeed
the
sum
may
differ
at
the
various
tables
are
you
prying
into
my
private
affairs
only
so
far
as
i
m
obliged
to
ma
am
never
mind
the
bridge
for
the
moment
was
embury
annoyed
with
his
wife
for
any
reason
when
he
called
to
take
her
home
now
how
should
i
know
that
a
pretty
look
of
perplexity
came
into
the
blue
eyes
i
m
not
a
mind
reader
you
re
a
woman
was
embury
put
out
fifi
laughed
a
ringing
peal
was
he
she
cried
as
if
suddenly
deciding
to
tell
the
truth
i
should
say
he
was
why
he
was
so
mad
i
was
positively
afraid
of
him
what
did
he
say
that
s
just
it
he
didn
t
say
anything
oh
he
spoke
to
me
pleasantly
he
was
polite
and
all
that
but
i
could
see
that
he
was
simply
boiling
underneath
you
are
a
mind
reader
then
i
didn
t
have
to
be
to
see
that
the
little
figure
rocked
back
and
forth
on
the
sofa
as
with
arms
clasped
round
one
knee
fifi
gave
way
to
a
dramatic
reconstruction
of
the
scene
come
eunice
he
said
just
like
that
and
you
bet
eunice
went
was
she
angry
too
rather
oh
you
know
her
temper
is
something
fierce
when
she
s
roused
she
s
like
a
roaring
lion
and
a
raging
bear
as
it
says
in
the
bible
or
shakespeare
or
speaking
of
shakespeare
you
and
embury
went
to
see
hamlet
recently
i
oh
yes
when
the
avon
players
put
it
on
everybody
went
didn
t
you
you
missed
it
if
you
didn
t
most
marvelous
performance
macbeth
too
that
was
perfectly
darling
i
went
to
that
with
excuse
me
as
to
hamlet
now
did
you
notice
particularly
the
speech
about
the
poisoning
of
of
hamlet
s
father
i
should
say
i
did
why
that
speech
by
postlewaite
he
was
the
ghost
you
know
was
stunning
as
much
applauded
as
the
soliloquy
itself
he
fairly
made
you
see
that
poisoning
scene
was
embury
interested
oh
we
both
were
we
were
at
school
together
and
we
both
loved
shakespeare
we
took
it
and
we
were
terribly
interested
in
the
avon
players
hamlet
it
was
unlike
any
representation
we
had
ever
ah
yes
and
did
you
you
and
embury
discuss
the
poison
used
by
the
wicked
uncle
not
lately
but
in
class
we
discussed
that
years
ago
oh
that
s
one
of
the
regulation
shakespearean
puzzles
you
can
t
trip
us
up
on
our
shakespeare
either
of
us
i
doubt
if
you
can
find
two
frivolous
society
women
who
know
it
better
than
we
do
did
you
know
that
embury
was
killed
in
a
manner
identical
with
the
hamlet
murder
no
what
do
you
mean
i
ve
really
not
heard
the
details
as
soon
as
i
heard
of
his
death
i
called
up
eunice
but
as
i
said
she
wasn
t
cordial
at
all
then
i
was
busy
with
my
own
guests
after
that
last
night
and
this
morning
well
i
m
really
hardly
awake
yet
fifi
rubbed
her
eyes
with
the
back
of
her
hand
a
childish
gesture
and
daintily
smothered
a
slight
yawn
but
i
m
awfully
interested
she
went
on
only
only
i
can
t
bear
to
hear
about
a
murder
the
details
i
mean
i
should
think
eunice
would
go
crazy
i
should
think
she
d
be
glad
to
come
here
i
was
going
to
ask
her
when
she
called
me
down
but
what
do
you
mean
killed
like
hamlet
s
father
yes
there
was
poison
introduced
into
his
ear
as
embury
slept
really
how
tragic
how
terrible
who
did
it
that
s
what
we
re
trying
to
discover
could
do
you
think
embury
could
have
had
sufficient
motive
eunice
fifi
screamed
what
an
idea
eunice
embury
to
kill
her
own
husband
oh
no
but
only
she
and
that
aunt
of
hers
had
opportunity
you
know
how
their
bedrooms
are
oh
yes
i
know
miss
ames
is
using
eunice
s
and
a
nuisance
it
is
then
you
know
that
at
night
those
three
bedrooms
are
shut
off
from
the
rest
of
the
house
by
strong
bolts
on
the
inside
of
the
yes
i
then
don
t
you
see
as
embury
was
killed
the
doctors
say
about
daybreak
or
earlier
nobody
could
have
done
it
except
somebody
who
was
behind
those
locked
the
windows
tenth
story
and
no
balconies
and
too
they
all
have
except
one
and
the
flowers
were
undisturbed
the
one
that
hasn
t
a
is
on
the
side
street
in
miss
ames
room
and
that
i
looked
out
myself
has
no
balcony
nor
even
a
broad
ledge
it
couldn
t
be
reached
from
the
next
apartment
if
that
s
what
you
re
thinking
i
m
not
thinking
of
anything
returned
fifi
i
m
too
dazed
to
think
eunice
embury
do
you
mean
she
is
really
suspected
i
mean
that
very
decidedly
ma
am
and
i
am
here
to
ask
you
if
you
can
give
any
additional
evidence
any
any
evidence
evidence
against
my
dear
friend
why
man
if
i
knew
anything
i
wouldn
t
tell
it
if
it
would
go
against
eunice
oh
yes
you
would
the
law
would
force
you
to
but
do
you
know
anything
definite
no
of
course
i
don
t
i
know
that
and
embury
were
not
always
cooing
like
she
had
the
devil
s
own
temper
and
he
wasn
t
much
better
i
know
he
drove
her
frantic
because
he
wouldn
t
give
her
some
privileges
she
wanted
wouldn
t
allow
her
certain
latitudes
and
was
generally
pretty
dictatorial
i
know
eunice
resented
this
and
i
know
that
lots
of
times
she
was
pretty
nearly
at
the
end
of
her
rope
and
she
said
all
sorts
of
things
that
of
course
she
didn
t
mean
but
she
wouldn
t
kill
him
oh
i
don
t
think
she
would
do
that
h
m
so
they
lived
like
cats
and
dogs
did
they
what
an
awful
way
to
put
it
but
well
sanford
didn
t
make
eunice
s
life
a
bed
of
roses
nor
did
she
go
out
of
her
way
to
please
him
mr
embury
was
often
a
guest
here
he
was
not
eunice
came
here
against
his
will
against
his
expressed
oho
she
did
and
her
visit
here
night
before
last
that
was
an
act
of
insubordination
it
was
i
wouldn
t
tell
this
but
it
s
sure
to
come
out
yes
he
had
especially
and
positively
forbidden
her
to
come
to
that
party
here
and
after
he
went
to
his
club
eunice
ran
away
from
home
and
came
naughty
girl
she
told
us
she
had
played
hookey
when
she
first
came
in
but
good
gracious
shane
that
was
no
crime
in
this
day
and
generation
a
wife
may
disobey
her
husband
and
get
away
with
it
the
arch
little
face
smiled
saucily
and
fifi
cuddled
into
her
corner
and
again
fell
i
can
t
believe
you
really
mean
you
think
eunice
did
it
she
broke
out
why
what
are
you
going
to
do
arrest
her
not
quite
although
she
is
under
strict
surveillance
at
what
can
t
she
go
out
if
she
likes
how
perfectly
absurd
oh
i
ve
a
notion
to
telephone
and
ask
her
to
go
for
a
drive
what
fun
shane
looked
at
the
mischievous
face
in
astonishment
he
was
experienced
in
human
nature
but
this
shallow
frivolous
attitude
toward
a
tragedy
was
new
to
him
i
thought
you
and
embury
were
friends
he
said
reprovingly
oh
we
are
or
rather
we
were
i
m
not
sure
i
can
know
her
after
this
but
you
see
i
can
t
take
it
seriously
i
can
t
really
believe
you
mean
that
you
think
eunice
guilty
why
i
d
a
thousand
times
rather
suspect
the
old
aunt
person
you
would
shane
spoke
eagerly
could
that
be
possible
it
could
be
possible
this
way
fifi
was
serious
now
you
see
miss
ames
adores
eunice
she
found
it
hard
to
forgive
sanford
for
his
tyrannical
ways
and
they
were
tyrannical
and
miss
ames
might
have
by
way
of
ridding
eunice
from
a
cruel
husband
might
have
oh
i
can
t
say
it
it
sounds
too
absurd
but
after
all
it
s
no
more
absurd
than
to
suspect
eunice
why
don
t
you
look
for
somebody
else
how
could
anybody
get
in
i
know
impatiently
but
i
ve
read
detective
stories
and
most
always
the
murder
is
committed
in
what
they
call
a
hermetically
sealed
room
and
yet
somebody
did
get
in
there
s
no
such
thing
as
a
hermetically
sealed
room
don
t
you
know
what
hermetically
sealed
means
yes
of
course
i
do
literally
but
that
phrase
is
used
in
detective
stories
to
mean
an
inaccessible
room
or
a
seemingly
inaccessible
one
but
always
it
comes
out
that
it
could
be
that
s
all
very
well
in
fiction
ma
am
but
it
won
t
work
in
this
case
why
i
looked
over
those
door
locks
myself
nobody
could
get
well
leaving
aside
the
way
they
got
in
let
s
see
whom
we
can
suspect
there
s
two
men
that
i
know
of
who
are
dead
in
love
with
embury
and
i
daresay
there
are
a
lot
more
who
can
see
a
silver
lining
in
this
cloud
what
what
do
you
mean
shane
was
fascinated
by
the
lovely
personality
of
desternay
and
he
began
to
think
that
she
might
be
of
some
real
help
to
him
though
a
skilled
detective
he
was
of
the
plodding
sort
and
never
had
brilliant
or
even
original
ideas
he
had
had
a
notion
it
would
have
been
better
to
send
driscoll
on
this
errand
he
was
himself
attempting
but
a
touch
of
jealousy
of
the
younger
and
more
man
made
him
determine
to
attend
to
desternay
himself
well
stupid
if
you
were
in
the
presence
of
embury
and
elliott
and
hendricks
as
you
said
you
were
and
didn
t
size
up
how
matters
stand
with
those
two
men
you
are
a
queer
sort
of
detective
her
light
laughter
rippled
pleasantly
and
shane
forgave
her
reproof
by
reason
of
her
charm
both
of
them
he
said
helplessly
yes
sir
both
of
them
she
mimicked
his
tone
you
see
shane
it
s
an
old
romance
all
round
when
eunice
ames
was
a
girl
three
men
fought
for
her
hand
the
two
we
ve
just
mentioned
and
embury
who
was
the
successful
suitor
and
he
succeeded
only
by
sheer
force
of
will
he
practically
stole
her
from
the
other
two
and
married
her
out
of
i
suppose
the
lady
agreed
of
course
but
it
was
a
marriage
in
haste
and
i
imagine
that
it
was
followed
by
the
proverbial
what
do
you
mean
asked
the
shane
that
they
repented
at
leisure
at
least
eunice
did
i
don
t
believe
sanford
ever
but
those
two
men
are
embury
s
sure
they
are
oh
friend
shane
were
you
born
yesterday
i
thought
detectives
were
a
little
more
than
that
of
course
they
re
all
friends
always
have
been
since
they
made
together
in
their
boston
did
you
belong
to
that
childish
group
me
lord
no
i
m
simon
pure
middle
west
and
i
glory
in
it
i
d
hate
to
be
of
new
england
descent
you
have
to
live
up
to
traditions
and
things
i
m
a
law
unto
myself
when
it
comes
to
life
and
living
and
you
met
embury
at
we
spent
four
years
together
chums
and
all
that
then
after
we
were
both
married
we
drifted
together
again
here
in
new
york
and
somehow
eunice
s
husband
didn
t
take
to
poor
little
fifi
one
bit
i
wonder
why
her
look
of
injured
innocence
was
charming
and
shane
had
to
make
an
effort
to
keep
to
the
subject
in
hand
so
those
two
men
admire
embury
admire
is
a
silly
word
they
adore
her
they
worship
the
ground
she
walks
on
they
are
no
doubt
decently
decorous
at
the
passing
of
their
old
friend
but
as
soon
as
the
funeral
baked
meats
are
cold
enough
look
out
for
a
marriage
table
on
which
to
serve
them
did
did
embury
realize
that
his
friends
so
admired
his
wife
probably
yes
of
course
he
did
but
he
didn
t
care
she
was
his
she
gave
them
no
encouragement
such
things
aren
t
done
fifi
s
eyes
rolled
upward
and
i
only
tell
you
to
show
you
that
there
are
at
least
other
directions
in
which
to
look
but
let
me
see
hendricks
was
in
boston
at
the
time
of
embury
s
then
that
lets
him
out
and
elliott
where
was
he
i
haven
t
made
definite
inquiry
probably
he
probably
he
has
an
alibi
oh
yes
of
course
he
has
and
if
he
killed
sanford
embury
he
s
more
likely
than
ever
to
have
a
fine
alibi
look
here
shane
i
believe
i
could
give
you
cards
and
spades
and
beat
you
at
your
little
detective
games
you
mix
me
all
up
with
your
ridiculous
suggestions
shane
tried
to
speak
sternly
but
was
forced
to
smile
at
the
roguish
laughing
face
that
mocked
him
all
right
play
your
own
game
i
tried
to
help
by
suggesting
more
suspects
in
a
multitude
of
suspects
there
is
safety
for
our
dear
eunice
and
she
never
did
it
if
you
can
t
contrive
a
way
for
either
of
those
two
men
to
get
through
those
bolted
doors
then
turn
your
eagle
eyes
toward
aunt
abby
she
s
a
queer
dick
if
you
ask
me
and
eunice
embury
well
i
admit
i
resent
her
coolness
last
night
but
i
freely
own
up
that
i
think
her
incapable
of
such
a
but
you
two
discussed
the
poisoning
business
in
the
play
we
did
but
we
discussed
lots
of
other
points
about
that
play
and
compared
it
with
other
presentations
we
have
seen
and
oh
you
re
too
absurd
to
hang
a
murder
on
that
woman
just
because
she
saw
a
murder
on
the
stage
or
rather
heard
the
description
of
one
but
that
s
the
coincidence
she
did
hear
that
murder
described
fully
she
did
talk
it
over
with
you
she
did
show
a
special
interest
in
it
then
a
week
or
so
later
her
husband
is
killed
by
identically
the
same
method
she
and
she
alone
except
for
a
mild
old
lady
has
opportunity
to
do
the
deed
the
instrument
of
death
is
found
in
her
cupboard
and
she
flies
into
a
rage
at
the
first
hint
of
accusation
of
the
crime
by
the
way
if
as
you
hint
one
of
those
men
did
it
would
they
leave
the
medicine
dropper
that
conveyed
the
poison
in
embury
s
rooms
would
they
want
to
bring
suspicion
against
the
woman
they
love
answer
me
that
there
might
be
another
solution
fifi
nodded
her
wise
little
head
thoughtfully
perhaps
whoever
did
it
tried
to
throw
suspicion
on
miss
that
makes
him
a
still
more
despicable
villain
to
implicate
falsely
a
harmless
old
lady
no
i
can
t
think
yet
you
think
embury
did
i
don
t
know
perhaps
the
two
women
worked
in
collusion
or
miss
ames
might
have
wakened
and
learned
the
truth
and
agreed
to
keep
the
secret
in
fact
miss
ames
confessed
that
she
did
the
murder
but
we
know
she
was
not
telling
the
truth
then
however
she
knows
who
did
do
it
i
ve
no
doubt
of
that
well
desternay
i
can
t
subscribe
to
your
original
if
rather
impossible
suggestions
but
i
thank
you
for
this
interview
and
i
may
say
you
have
helped
i
have
how
not
against
eunice
never
mind
ma
am
i
must
get
off
by
myself
and
straighten
out
my
notes
and
see
where
i
stand
are
you
going
to
telephone
to
embury
again
no
and
the
little
head
was
tossed
proudly
if
she
wants
me
let
her
call
me
up
i
did
my
part
now
i
ll
subside
and
too
if
she
is
is
oh
i
can
t
say
it
but
i
ll
wait
further
developments
before
i
decide
just
where
i
stand
in
regard
to
eunice
embury
chapter
xii
in
hanlon
s
office
in
an
office
building
away
downtown
a
little
old
lady
stood
in
the
lobby
studying
the
great
bulletin
board
of
room
numbers
can
i
help
you
ma
am
asked
the
elevator
starter
seeing
her
perplexity
i
want
sykes
and
barton
scenic
sign
painters
she
said
positively
enough
but
there
are
so
many
s
s
i
can
t
seem
to
find
them
all
right
ma
am
here
they
are
sixth
floor
room
thank
you
the
old
lady
said
and
entered
the
elevator
he
indicated
she
seemed
preoccupied
and
made
no
move
to
leave
the
car
until
the
elevator
man
spoke
to
her
twice
this
is
the
floor
you
want
lady
he
said
room
that
way
just
round
that
first
miss
ames
started
off
in
the
way
he
pointed
and
stood
for
a
moment
in
front
of
the
door
numbered
then
with
a
determined
shake
of
her
thin
shoulders
she
opened
the
door
and
walked
in
i
want
to
see
hanlon
she
said
to
the
girl
at
the
first
desk
by
appointment
no
but
say
it
is
miss
ames
he
ll
see
why
miss
ames
how
do
you
do
and
the
man
who
had
so
interested
the
beholders
of
his
feat
in
newark
came
forward
to
greet
her
come
right
into
my
office
and
he
led
her
to
an
inner
room
now
what
s
it
all
about
the
cheery
reception
set
his
visitor
at
ease
and
she
drew
a
long
breath
of
relief
as
she
settled
herself
in
the
chair
he
offered
oh
hanlon
i
m
so
frightened
or
at
least
i
was
it
s
all
so
noisy
and
confusing
down
here
why
i
haven
t
been
downtown
in
new
york
for
twenty
years
that
so
then
i
must
take
you
up
on
our
roof
and
show
you
a
few
of
the
skyscrapers
no
no
i
ve
not
time
for
anything
like
that
oh
hanlon
you
have
you
read
in
the
papers
of
our
our
trouble
yes
and
the
young
man
spoke
gravely
i
have
miss
ames
just
a
week
ago
wasn
t
it
yes
and
they
re
no
nearer
a
solution
of
the
mystery
than
ever
and
oh
hanlon
they
re
still
suspecting
eunice
embury
and
i
must
save
her
she
didn
t
do
it
truly
she
didn
t
and
i
think
i
what
yes
i
truly
think
so
but
i
wasn
t
myself
you
know
i
was
hypnotized
hypnotized
by
whom
i
don
t
know
by
some
awful
person
who
wanted
sanford
dead
i
but
that
s
ridiculous
miss
ames
no
it
isn
t
i
m
a
very
easy
subject
have
you
ever
been
hypnotized
not
very
successfully
but
no
real
hypnotizer
ever
tried
it
i
m
sure
though
i
d
be
a
perfect
subject
i
m
so
so
psychic
you
know
bosh
and
nonsense
you
know
miss
ames
what
i
think
of
that
sort
of
thing
you
know
how
i
played
on
people
s
gullibility
when
i
used
to
do
that
fake
i
know
hanlon
and
miss
ames
was
very
earnest
but
and
this
is
why
i
m
here
you
told
me
that
in
all
the
foolery
and
there
was
you
believed
two
per
cent
of
genuine
telepathy
two
per
cent
of
genuine
communication
with
spirits
of
the
but
i
said
that
merely
in
a
general
way
miss
ames
i
didn
t
mean
to
say
it
was
a
proven
proposition
that
isn
t
the
point
you
told
me
there
were
a
few
a
very
few
real
sincere
mediums
now
i
m
here
to
get
the
address
of
the
best
one
you
know
of
i
want
to
go
to
him
or
her
and
have
a
s√©ance
and
i
want
to
get
into
communication
with
sanford
with
embury
s
spirit
and
learn
from
him
who
killed
him
it
s
the
only
way
we
can
ever
find
miss
ames
gray
eyes
took
on
a
strange
look
she
seemed
half
hypnotized
at
the
moment
as
she
looked
at
hanlon
he
moved
uncomfortably
under
her
gaze
well
he
said
at
length
i
can
give
you
the
address
of
the
best
the
only
real
medium
i
know
that
i
will
do
with
pleasure
but
i
can
not
guarantee
his
bringing
about
a
materialization
of
of
never
mind
about
materialization
if
he
can
get
in
touch
and
get
a
message
for
me
you
see
i
haven
t
said
much
about
this
but
embury
s
spirit
appeared
to
me
as
as
he
what
yes
just
at
the
moment
his
soul
passed
from
earth
his
astral
body
passed
by
me
and
paused
at
my
bedside
for
a
you
amaze
me
you
are
indeed
psychic
tell
me
about
no
i
won
t
tell
you
the
story
i
ll
tell
the
medium
but
i
know
i
saw
him
why
he
was
discernible
to
all
my
five
senses
to
your
senses
then
it
was
no
spirit
oh
yes
it
was
sanford
s
body
still
lay
on
his
own
bed
but
his
passing
spirit
materialized
sufficiently
for
me
to
see
it
to
hear
it
to
feel
miss
ames
you
mustn
t
go
to
a
medium
you
are
too
imaginative
too
easily
swayed
don
t
go
dear
lady
it
can
do
no
young
hanlon
looked
as
he
felt
very
solicitous
for
the
aged
spinster
and
he
cast
an
anxious
glance
at
her
disturbed
face
i
must
she
insisted
it
is
the
only
way
i
had
great
trouble
to
find
you
hanlon
i
had
to
communicate
with
mortimer
in
newark
and
at
last
we
traced
you
here
are
you
all
through
with
your
fake
tricks
yes
hanlon
laughed
i
wore
them
out
i
ve
gone
into
a
legitimate
sign
painting
yes
as
you
but
such
big
signs
and
the
old
lady
s
eyes
wandered
to
photographs
and
sketches
of
enormous
scenic
signs
such
as
are
painted
on
high
buildings
or
built
on
housetops
that
s
the
specialty
of
this
firm
i
m
only
learning
but
it
strongly
appeals
to
me
it
s
really
more
of
an
art
than
a
trade
now
as
to
this
man
you
want
to
see
miss
ames
i
ll
give
you
his
address
but
i
beg
of
you
to
think
it
over
before
you
visit
him
consult
with
some
one
not
embury
some
man
of
good
judgment
and
clear
mind
who
is
advising
you
mr
hendricks
and
elliott
you
saw
them
both
the
day
you
were
at
our
house
they
advise
my
niece
and
myself
in
all
matters
shall
i
ask
them
miss
abby
was
pathetic
in
her
simple
inquiry
and
hanlon
spoke
gently
as
he
replied
yes
if
you
are
determined
to
try
the
experiment
but
i
do
not
advise
you
to
see
marigny
the
medium
i
spoke
of
here
is
the
address
but
you
talk
it
over
with
those
two
men
you
mentioned
i
know
they
are
both
practical
logical
business
men
and
their
advice
on
the
subject
will
be
all
right
i
thank
you
miss
ames
for
honoring
me
with
a
call
i
hope
if
you
do
go
to
see
marigny
it
will
prove
a
satisfactory
s√©ance
but
i
also
hope
you
will
decide
not
to
go
you
are
as
i
said
too
emotional
too
easily
swayed
by
the
supernatural
to
go
very
deeply
into
those
mysteries
shall
i
take
you
to
the
elevator
if
you
please
hanlon
and
still
in
that
half
oblivious
mood
miss
ames
allowed
herself
to
be
led
through
the
halls
hanlon
went
down
with
her
for
he
feared
to
leave
her
to
her
own
devices
he
was
relieved
to
find
she
had
a
taxicab
in
waiting
and
as
he
put
her
into
it
he
cautioned
the
driver
to
take
his
fare
straight
home
but
i
want
to
go
to
marigny
s
now
objected
miss
ames
as
she
heard
what
hanlon
said
oh
you
can
t
you
must
make
an
appointment
with
him
by
mail
or
by
telephone
and
too
you
promised
me
you
d
put
it
up
to
hendricks
or
elliott
so
i
did
and
the
old
head
nodded
submissively
as
the
taxi
drove
away
when
ferdinand
admitted
aunt
abby
to
the
embury
home
she
heard
voices
in
the
that
were
unmistakably
raised
in
anger
you
know
perfectly
well
fifi
eunice
was
saying
that
your
little
bridge
games
are
quite
big
enough
to
be
called
a
violation
of
the
law
you
know
that
such
stakes
as
you
people
play
for
it
isn
t
the
size
of
the
stake
that
makes
gambling
fifi
desternay
cried
shrilly
i
ve
had
the
advice
of
a
lawyer
and
he
says
that
as
long
as
it
s
my
own
home
and
the
players
are
invited
guests
there
s
no
possibility
of
being
raided
said
eunice
scathingly
might
as
well
call
things
by
their
real
name
hush
up
some
of
the
servants
might
hear
you
how
unkind
you
are
to
me
eunice
you
used
to
love
your
little
fifi
well
she
doesn
t
now
said
miss
ames
tartly
as
she
came
in
you
see
desternay
you
have
been
instrumental
in
bringing
our
dear
eunice
under
a
dreadful
and
absolutely
unfounded
suspicion
dreadful
but
far
from
unfounded
declared
desternay
her
little
hands
uplifted
and
her
pretty
face
showing
a
scornful
smile
you
and
i
aunt
abby
know
what
our
dear
eunice
s
temper
is
don
t
you
aunt
abby
me
you
little
piece
i
am
surprised
eunice
allows
you
in
this
house
now
now
if
eunice
doesn
t
want
me
i
ll
get
out
and
jolly
well
glad
to
do
so
how
about
it
eunice
i
came
here
to
help
but
if
i
m
not
wanted
out
goes
little
fifi
she
rose
shaking
her
fur
stole
into
place
about
her
dainty
person
and
whipping
out
a
tiny
mirror
from
her
vanity
case
she
applied
a
rouge
stick
to
her
already
scarlet
lips
no
no
and
eunice
wailed
despairingly
don
t
go
fifi
i
oh
i
don
t
know
how
i
feel
toward
you
you
see
i
will
speak
plainly
you
see
it
was
my
acquaintance
with
you
that
caused
the
trouble
mostly
between
me
and
thought
it
was
money
matters
his
stinginess
you
he
wasn
t
stingy
he
wouldn
t
give
me
an
allowance
but
he
was
generous
in
every
other
way
and
that
s
why
why
you
came
to
my
gambling
house
to
try
to
pick
up
a
little
ready
cash
i
know
but
now
looky
here
eunice
you
ve
got
to
decide
either
you
re
with
me
or
agin
me
i
won
t
have
any
blow
hot
blow
cold
you
re
friends
with
fifi
desternay
or
she
s
your
enemy
what
do
you
mean
just
what
i
say
you
like
me
you
ve
always
liked
me
now
stand
by
me
and
i
ll
stand
by
how
you
think
i
can
t
well
madame
you
re
greatly
mistaken
that
big
blundering
fool
of
a
detective
person
has
been
to
see
me
shane
the
same
and
he
grilled
me
pretty
thoroughly
as
to
our
going
to
see
hamlet
and
whether
we
talked
the
poison
scene
over
and
so
forth
and
so
on
in
a
word
eunice
embury
i
hold
your
life
in
my
hands
fifi
held
out
her
pretty
little
hands
dramatically
she
still
stood
her
white
fur
scarf
hanging
from
one
shoulder
her
small
turban
of
red
breast
feathers
cocked
at
a
jaunty
angle
above
her
straight
brows
and
one
tiny
slippered
foot
tapping
decidedly
on
the
floor
yes
ma
am
in
my
two
hands
me
fifi
if
i
tell
all
we
said
about
that
poisoning
of
the
old
hamlet
gentleman
through
his
ear
you
know
what
we
said
eunice
embury
you
know
how
we
discussed
the
impossibility
of
such
a
murder
ever
being
discovered
you
know
if
i
should
give
shane
a
full
account
of
that
talk
of
ours
the
life
of
madame
embury
wouldn
t
be
worth
that
a
snap
of
a
dainty
thumb
and
finger
gave
a
sharp
click
that
went
straight
through
eunice
s
brain
and
made
her
gasp
out
a
frightened
oh
yes
ma
am
oh
all
you
like
to
you
can
t
deny
it
shane
came
to
see
me
three
times
i
almost
told
him
all
the
last
time
for
you
steadily
refused
to
see
me
until
and
now
i
put
it
to
you
eunice
embury
do
you
want
me
for
friend
or
foe
fifi
s
blue
eyes
glittered
her
red
lips
closed
in
a
tight
line
and
her
little
pointed
face
was
as
the
face
of
a
wicked
sprite
eunice
stood
surveying
her
tall
stately
beautiful
she
towered
above
her
guest
and
looked
down
on
her
with
a
fine
disdain
eunice
s
eyes
were
stormy
not
glittering
desperate
rather
than
defiant
she
seemed
almost
like
a
fierce
powerful
tiger
appraising
a
small
but
very
wily
ferret
is
this
a
bargain
she
cried
scathingly
are
you
offering
to
buy
my
friendship
i
know
you
fifi
desternay
you
are
a
snake
in
the
grass
fifi
clenched
her
little
fists
drew
her
lips
between
her
teeth
and
fairly
hissed
serpent
yourself
murderess
i
know
all
and
i
shall
tell
all
you
ll
regret
the
day
you
scorned
the
friendship
the
help
of
fifi
desternay
i
don
t
want
your
help
at
the
price
of
friendship
with
you
i
know
you
for
what
you
are
my
husband
told
me
others
have
told
me
i
did
go
to
your
house
for
the
sake
of
winning
money
yes
and
i
am
ashamed
of
it
and
i
am
ready
to
face
any
accusation
brave
any
suspicion
rather
than
be
shielded
from
it
or
helped
out
of
it
by
you
fine
words
but
they
mean
nothing
you
know
you
re
justly
accused
you
know
you
re
rightly
suspected
but
you
are
clever
you
also
know
that
no
jury
in
this
enlightened
age
will
ever
convict
a
woman
especially
a
beautiful
woman
you
know
you
are
safe
from
even
the
lightest
sentence
and
that
though
you
are
guilty
yes
guilty
of
the
murder
of
your
husband
you
will
get
off
scot
free
because
fifi
paused
to
give
her
last
shot
telling
effect
because
your
counsel
alvord
hendricks
is
in
love
with
you
he
will
manage
it
and
what
he
can
t
accomplish
mason
elliott
can
with
those
two
influential
men
both
in
love
with
you
you
can
t
be
convicted
and
probably
you
won
t
even
be
arrested
go
said
eunice
and
she
folded
her
arms
as
she
gazed
at
her
angry
antagonist
go
i
scorn
to
refute
or
even
answer
your
because
they
re
true
because
there
is
no
answer
fifi
fairly
screamed
you
think
you
re
a
power
because
you
re
tall
and
statuesque
and
stunning
you
know
if
those
men
can
t
keep
you
out
of
the
at
least
you
are
safe
in
the
hands
of
any
judge
or
jury
because
they
are
men
you
know
if
you
smile
at
them
pathetically
if
you
cast
those
wonderful
eyes
of
yours
at
them
they
ll
grovel
at
your
feet
i
know
you
eunice
embury
you
re
banking
on
your
femininity
to
save
you
from
your
just
you
judge
me
by
yourself
fifi
you
are
a
power
among
men
most
women
are
but
i
do
not
bank
on
that
not
alone
you
bank
on
the
fact
that
either
hendricks
or
elliott
would
go
through
hell
for
you
and
count
it
an
easy
journey
you
rest
easy
in
the
knowledge
that
those
two
men
can
do
just
about
anything
they
set
their
minds
to
will
you
go
yes
i
will
go
and
when
shane
comes
to
see
me
again
i
will
tell
him
the
truth
all
the
truth
about
the
hamlet
play
and
it
will
be
enough
tell
him
eunice
s
eyes
blazed
now
tell
him
the
truth
and
add
to
it
whatever
lies
your
clever
brain
can
invent
do
your
worst
fifi
desternay
i
am
not
afraid
of
you
i
am
going
fifi
moved
slowly
toward
the
door
i
shall
tell
the
truth
but
i
shall
add
no
lies
that
will
not
be
necessary
she
disappeared
and
eunice
stood
panting
with
excitement
and
indignation
aunt
abby
came
toward
her
the
old
lady
had
been
a
witness
of
the
whole
scene
had
indeed
tried
several
times
to
utter
a
word
of
pacification
but
neither
of
the
women
had
so
much
as
noticed
her
go
away
auntie
please
said
eunice
i
can
t
talk
to
you
i
m
expecting
mason
at
any
time
now
and
i
want
to
get
calmed
down
a
miss
ames
went
to
her
room
and
eunice
sat
down
on
the
davenport
she
sat
upright
tensely
quiet
and
thought
over
all
fifi
had
said
all
she
had
threatened
it
would
have
been
far
better
eunice
told
herself
for
my
cause
if
i
had
held
her
friendship
and
i
could
have
done
it
easily
but
fifi
s
friendship
would
be
worse
than
her
enmity
when
mason
elliott
came
detective
driscoll
was
with
him
the
net
of
the
detectives
was
closing
in
around
eunice
and
though
both
elliott
and
hendricks
as
fifi
had
truly
surmised
were
doing
all
in
their
power
the
d√©nouement
was
not
far
off
eunice
was
in
imminent
danger
of
arrest
at
any
moment
we
ve
been
talking
about
the
will
sanford
s
will
elliott
said
in
a
dreary
tone
after
the
callers
were
seated
and
eunice
driscoll
chooses
to
think
that
the
fact
that
san
left
practically
everything
to
you
without
any
restraint
in
the
way
of
trustees
or
restriction
of
any
sort
is
another
count
against
eunice
smiled
bravely
but
that
isn
t
news
she
said
we
all
knew
that
my
husband
made
me
his
sole
or
rather
principal
beneficiary
i
know
the
consensus
of
opinion
is
that
i
murdered
my
husband
that
i
might
have
his
money
and
full
control
of
it
this
is
no
new
no
said
driscoll
moved
by
the
sight
of
the
now
patient
gentle
face
no
but
we
ve
added
a
few
more
facts
and
look
here
embury
it
s
this
way
i
ve
doped
it
out
that
there
are
five
persons
who
could
possibly
have
committed
this
this
crime
i
ll
speak
plainly
for
you
have
continually
permitted
me
even
urged
me
to
do
so
well
let
us
say
sanford
embury
could
have
been
killed
by
anyone
of
a
certain
five
and
they
size
up
like
this
elliott
here
and
alvord
hendricks
may
be
said
to
have
had
motive
but
no
motive
said
eunice
in
a
tone
of
deepest
possible
scorn
yes
ma
am
elliott
now
is
an
admirer
of
yours
don
t
look
offended
please
i
m
speaking
very
seriously
it
is
among
the
possibilities
that
he
wanted
your
husband
out
of
his
mason
elliott
listened
to
this
without
any
expression
of
annoyance
indeed
he
had
heard
this
argument
of
driscoll
s
before
and
it
affected
him
not
at
all
but
embury
elliott
had
no
opportunity
we
have
learned
beyond
all
doubt
that
he
was
at
his
club
or
at
his
home
all
that
night
next
hendricks
had
a
motive
the
rival
candidates
were
both
eager
for
election
and
we
must
call
that
a
motive
for
hendricks
to
be
willing
to
remove
his
opponent
but
again
hendricks
had
no
opportunity
he
was
in
boston
from
the
afternoon
of
the
day
before
embury
s
death
until
noon
of
the
next
day
that
lets
him
out
positively
therefore
there
are
two
with
motives
but
no
opportunity
next
we
must
admit
there
were
two
who
had
opportunity
but
no
motive
i
refer
to
ferdinand
your
butler
and
miss
ames
your
aunt
these
two
could
have
managed
to
commit
the
deed
had
they
chosen
but
we
can
find
no
motive
to
attribute
to
either
of
them
it
has
been
suggested
that
miss
ames
might
have
had
such
a
desire
to
rid
you
embury
of
a
tyrannical
husband
that
she
was
guilty
but
it
is
so
highly
improbable
as
to
be
almost
unbelievable
therefore
as
i
sum
it
up
the
two
who
had
motive
without
opportunity
and
the
two
who
had
opportunity
without
motive
must
all
be
disregarded
because
of
the
one
who
had
motive
and
opportunity
both
yourself
the
arraignment
was
complete
driscoll
s
quiet
even
tones
carried
a
sort
of
calm
conviction
and
so
eunice
mason
elliott
spoke
up
i
m
going
to
try
one
more
chance
i
ve
persuaded
driscoll
to
wait
a
day
or
two
before
progressing
any
further
and
let
me
get
fleming
stone
on
this
very
well
said
eunice
listlessly
who
is
he
a
celebrated
detective
driscoll
makes
no
objection
which
goes
to
prove
what
a
good
detective
he
is
himself
his
partner
shane
is
not
so
willing
but
has
grudgingly
consented
in
fact
they
couldn
t
help
themselves
for
they
are
not
quite
sure
that
they
have
enough
evidence
to
arrest
you
shane
thinks
that
stone
will
find
out
more
and
so
strengthen
the
case
against
you
but
driscoll
bless
him
thinks
maybe
stone
can
find
another
i
didn
t
exactly
say
i
thought
that
elliott
said
driscoll
i
said
i
hoped
we
all
hope
it
returned
elliott
hope
while
you
may
and
driscoll
sighed
fleming
stone
has
never
failed
to
find
the
criminal
yet
and
if
his
findings
verify
mine
i
shall
be
glad
to
put
the
responsibility
on
his
chapter
xiii
fleming
stone
one
of
the
handsomest
types
of
american
manhood
is
that
rather
frequently
seen
combination
of
hair
and
dark
eyes
that
look
out
from
under
heavy
brows
with
a
keen
comprehensive
glance
this
type
of
man
is
always
a
thinker
usually
a
professional
man
and
almost
invariably
a
man
of
able
brain
he
is
nearly
always
physically
and
of
good
carriage
and
demeanor
at
any
rate
fleming
stone
was
all
of
these
things
and
when
he
came
into
the
embury
his
appearance
was
in
such
contrast
to
that
of
the
other
two
detectives
that
eunice
greeted
him
with
a
pleased
smile
neither
shane
nor
driscoll
was
present
and
mason
elliott
introduced
stone
to
the
two
ladies
with
a
deep
and
fervent
hope
that
the
great
detective
could
free
eunice
from
the
cloud
of
danger
and
disgrace
that
hovered
above
her
head
his
magnetic
smile
was
so
attractive
that
aunt
abby
nodded
her
head
in
complete
approval
of
the
newcomer
and
now
tell
me
all
about
everything
stone
said
as
they
seated
themselves
in
a
cozy
group
i
know
the
newspaper
facts
but
that
s
all
i
must
do
my
work
quite
apart
from
the
beaten
track
and
i
want
any
sidelights
or
bits
of
information
that
your
local
detectives
may
have
overlooked
and
which
may
help
you
don
t
think
eunice
did
it
do
you
stone
aunt
abby
broke
out
impulsively
quite
forgetting
the
man
was
a
comparative
stranger
i
am
going
to
work
on
the
theory
that
she
did
not
he
declared
then
we
will
see
what
we
can
scare
up
in
the
way
of
evidence
against
some
one
else
first
give
me
a
good
look
at
those
doors
that
shut
off
the
with
a
grave
face
fleming
stone
studied
the
doors
which
as
he
saw
when
bolted
on
the
inside
left
no
means
of
access
to
the
three
rooms
in
which
the
family
had
slept
except
the
windows
stone
mused
and
went
to
look
at
them
as
they
all
had
window
boxes
save
one
in
aunt
abby
s
room
and
as
that
was
about
a
hundred
feet
from
the
ground
he
dismissed
the
possibility
of
an
intruder
nobody
could
climb
over
the
plants
without
breaking
them
said
eunice
with
a
sigh
at
the
inevitable
deduction
stone
looked
closely
at
the
plants
kept
in
perfect
order
by
aunt
abby
who
loved
the
work
and
who
tended
them
every
day
not
a
leaf
was
crushed
not
a
stem
broken
and
the
scarlet
geranium
blossoms
stood
straight
up
like
so
many
mute
witnesses
against
any
burglarious
entrance
stone
returned
to
aunt
abby
s
side
window
and
leaning
over
the
sill
looked
out
and
down
to
the
street
below
couldn
t
be
reached
even
by
firemen
s
ladders
he
said
and
anyway
the
police
would
have
spotted
any
ladder
i
tried
to
think
some
one
came
in
at
that
window
said
elliott
but
even
so
nobody
could
go
through
miss
ames
room
and
then
embury
s
room
and
so
on
to
embury
s
room
do
his
deadly
work
and
return
again
without
waking
the
ladies
not
only
that
but
how
could
he
get
in
the
window
said
eunice
there
s
no
possible
way
of
climbing
across
from
the
next
apartment
oh
i
m
honest
with
myself
she
added
as
stone
looked
at
her
curiously
i
don
t
deceive
myself
by
thinking
impossibilities
could
happen
but
somebody
killed
my
husband
and
according
to
the
detectives
i
am
the
only
one
who
had
both
motive
and
opportunity
had
you
a
motive
embury
stone
asked
quietly
eunice
stared
at
him
they
say
so
she
replied
they
say
i
was
unhappy
with
and
were
you
the
very
directness
of
stone
s
pertinent
questions
seemed
to
compel
eunice
s
truthful
answers
and
she
said
of
course
i
was
but
that
eunice
hush
broke
in
elliott
with
a
pained
look
don
t
say
such
things
dear
it
can
do
no
good
and
may
injure
your
not
with
me
stone
declared
my
work
has
led
me
rather
intimately
into
people
s
lives
and
i
am
willing
to
go
on
record
as
saying
that
fifty
per
cent
of
marriages
are
unhappy
more
or
less
whether
that
is
a
motive
for
murder
depends
entirely
on
the
temper
and
temperament
of
the
married
ones
themselves
but
it
is
very
rarely
that
a
wife
kills
her
why
there
are
lots
of
cases
in
the
papers
said
miss
ames
and
never
are
the
women
convicted
either
oh
not
lots
of
cases
objected
stone
but
the
few
that
do
occur
are
usually
tragic
and
dramatic
and
fill
a
front
page
for
a
few
days
now
let
s
sift
down
this
remarkably
definite
statement
of
motives
and
opportunities
that
your
eminent
detectives
have
catalogued
i
m
told
that
they
ve
two
people
with
motive
and
no
opportunity
two
more
with
opportunity
and
no
motive
and
one
embury
who
fulfills
both
requirements
quite
an
elaborate
schedule
to
be
sure
eunice
looked
at
him
with
a
glimmer
of
hope
surely
a
man
who
talked
like
that
didn
t
place
implicit
reliance
on
the
schedule
in
question
and
yet
stone
went
on
it
is
certainly
true
a
motive
is
a
queer
thing
an
elusive
uncertain
thing
they
say
i
have
this
from
the
detectives
hendricks
and
elliott
both
had
the
motive
of
deep
affection
for
embury
please
don
t
be
offended
i
am
speaking
quite
impersonally
now
hendricks
i
am
advised
also
had
a
strong
motive
in
a
desire
to
remove
a
rival
candidate
for
an
important
election
but
neither
of
these
gentlemen
had
opportunity
as
each
has
proven
a
perfect
and
indubitable
alibi
i
admit
the
alibis
i
ve
looked
into
them
and
they
are
unimpeachable
but
i
don
t
admit
the
motives
granting
a
man
s
affection
for
a
married
woman
it
is
not
at
all
a
likely
thing
for
him
to
kill
her
right
stone
and
mason
elliott
s
voice
rang
out
in
honest
appreciation
again
it
is
absurd
to
suspect
one
election
candidate
of
killing
another
it
isn
t
done
and
one
very
good
reason
is
that
if
the
criminal
should
be
discovered
he
has
small
chance
for
the
election
he
coveted
and
there
is
always
a
chance
and
a
strong
one
that
murder
will
out
so
personally
i
admit
i
don
t
subscribe
entirely
to
the
program
of
my
esteemed
colleagues
now
as
to
these
two
people
with
opportunity
but
no
motive
they
are
i
m
told
miss
ames
and
the
butler
very
well
i
grant
their
opportunity
but
since
they
are
alleged
to
have
no
motive
why
consider
them
at
all
this
brings
us
to
eunice
was
watching
the
speaker
fascinated
she
had
never
met
a
man
like
this
before
though
stone
s
manner
was
by
no
means
flippant
he
seemed
to
take
a
light
view
of
some
aspects
of
the
case
but
now
he
looked
at
eunice
very
earnestly
i
am
informed
he
went
on
slowly
that
you
have
an
ungovernable
temper
nothing
of
the
sort
eunice
cried
tossing
her
head
defiantly
and
turning
angry
eyes
on
the
bland
detective
i
am
supposed
to
be
unable
to
control
myself
but
it
is
not
true
as
a
child
i
gave
way
to
fits
of
temper
i
acknowledge
but
i
have
overcome
that
tendency
and
i
am
no
more
now
than
other
people
as
always
when
roused
eunice
looked
strikingly
beautiful
her
eyes
shone
and
her
cheeks
showed
a
crimson
flush
she
drew
herself
up
haughtily
and
clenching
her
hands
on
the
back
of
a
chair
as
she
stood
facing
stone
she
said
if
you
have
come
here
to
browbeat
me
to
discuss
my
personal
characteristics
you
may
go
i
ve
no
intention
of
being
brought
to
book
by
a
detective
why
eunice
don
t
talk
that
way
begged
aunt
abby
i
m
sure
stone
is
trying
to
get
you
freed
from
the
awful
thing
that
is
hanging
over
you
there
s
no
awful
thing
hanging
over
me
i
don
t
know
what
you
mean
aunt
abby
there
can
t
be
anything
worse
than
to
have
a
stranger
come
in
here
and
remark
on
my
unfortunate
weakness
in
sometimes
giving
way
to
my
sense
of
righteous
indignation
i
resent
it
i
won
t
have
it
mason
you
brought
stone
here
now
take
him
away
there
there
eunice
you
are
not
quite
yourself
and
i
don
t
wonder
this
scene
is
too
much
for
you
i
m
sure
you
will
make
allowance
stone
for
embury
s
overwrought
nerves
of
course
and
fleming
stone
spoke
coldly
without
sympathy
or
even
apparent
interest
let
embury
retire
to
her
room
if
she
they
had
all
returned
to
the
big
and
stone
stood
near
a
front
window
now
and
then
glancing
out
to
the
trees
in
park
avenue
below
i
don
t
want
to
retire
to
my
room
eunice
cried
i
don
t
want
to
be
set
aside
as
if
i
were
a
child
i
did
want
stone
to
investigate
this
whole
matter
but
i
don
t
now
i
ve
changed
my
mind
mason
tell
him
to
go
away
no
dear
and
elliott
looked
at
her
kindly
you
can
t
change
your
mind
like
that
stone
has
the
case
and
he
will
go
on
with
it
and
when
you
come
to
yourself
again
you
will
be
glad
for
he
will
free
you
from
suspicion
by
finding
the
real
i
don
t
want
him
to
i
don
t
want
the
criminal
found
i
want
it
to
be
an
unsolved
mystery
always
and
forever
no
elliott
spoke
more
firmly
no
eunice
that
is
not
what
you
stop
i
know
what
i
want
without
your
telling
me
you
overstep
your
privileges
mason
i
m
not
an
imbecile
to
be
ignored
set
aside
overruled
i
won
t
stand
it
stone
you
are
discharged
she
stood
pointing
to
the
door
with
a
gesture
that
would
have
been
melodramatic
had
she
not
been
so
desperately
in
earnest
the
soft
black
sleeve
fell
away
from
her
soft
white
arm
and
her
hand
was
steady
and
unwavering
as
she
stood
silent
but
quivering
with
suppressed
rage
eunice
and
going
to
her
elliott
took
the
cold
white
hand
in
his
own
eunice
he
said
and
no
more
but
his
eyes
looked
deeply
into
hers
she
gazed
steadily
for
a
moment
and
then
her
face
softened
and
she
turned
aside
and
sank
wearily
into
a
chair
do
as
you
like
she
said
in
a
low
murmur
i
ll
leave
it
to
you
mason
let
stone
go
yes
go
ahead
stone
said
aunt
abby
eagerly
i
ll
show
you
anywhere
you
want
to
go
anything
you
want
to
see
i
ll
tell
you
all
about
why
do
you
know
anything
i
haven
t
been
told
miss
ames
i
thought
we
had
pretty
well
sized
up
the
yes
but
i
can
tell
you
something
that
nobody
else
will
listen
to
and
i
think
you
eunice
started
up
again
aunt
abby
she
said
if
you
begin
that
pack
of
fool
nonsense
about
a
vision
i
ll
leave
the
room
i
vow
i
will
leave
then
retorted
aunt
abby
whose
patience
was
also
under
a
strain
but
stone
said
wait
please
i
want
a
few
more
matters
mentioned
and
then
miss
ames
i
will
listen
to
your
fool
nonsense
first
what
is
this
talk
about
money
troubles
between
and
embury
that
eunice
seemed
interested
is
utter
folly
my
husband
objected
to
giving
me
a
definite
allowance
but
he
gave
me
twice
the
sum
i
would
have
asked
for
and
more
too
by
letting
me
have
charge
accounts
everywhere
i
then
you
didn
t
kill
him
for
that
reason
and
the
dark
eyes
of
the
detective
rested
on
eunice
kindly
no
i
did
not
she
said
curtly
and
stone
returned
i
believe
you
embury
if
you
were
the
criminal
that
was
not
the
motive
next
he
went
on
what
about
this
quarrel
you
and
embury
had
the
night
before
his
death
that
was
because
i
had
disobeyed
his
express
orders
eunice
said
frankly
and
bravely
and
i
went
to
a
bridge
game
at
a
house
to
which
he
had
forbidden
me
to
go
i
am
sorry
and
i
wish
i
could
tell
him
fleming
stone
looked
at
her
closely
was
she
sincere
or
was
she
merely
a
clever
actress
a
game
for
high
stakes
i
assume
he
said
quietly
very
high
embury
objected
strongly
to
my
playing
there
but
i
went
hoping
to
win
some
money
that
i
that
you
wanted
for
some
particular
purpose
no
only
that
i
might
have
a
few
dollars
in
my
purse
as
other
women
do
it
all
comes
back
to
the
same
old
quarrel
stone
you
don
t
know
i
can
t
make
you
understand
how
humiliating
how
galling
it
is
for
a
woman
to
have
no
money
of
her
own
nobody
understands
but
i
have
been
subjected
to
shame
and
embarrassment
hundreds
of
times
for
the
want
of
a
bit
of
ready
money
i
think
i
do
understand
embury
i
know
how
hard
it
must
have
been
for
a
proud
woman
to
have
that
annoyance
did
embury
object
to
the
lady
who
was
your
hostess
that
evening
yes
he
did
desternay
is
an
old
school
friend
of
mine
but
embury
never
liked
her
and
he
objected
more
strenuously
because
she
had
the
bridge
and
the
lady
s
attitude
toward
you
fifi
oh
i
don
t
know
we
ve
always
been
friends
generally
speaking
but
we
ve
had
quarrels
now
and
then
sometimes
we
d
be
really
intimate
and
then
again
we
wouldn
t
speak
for
six
weeks
at
a
time
just
petty
tiffs
you
know
but
they
seemed
serious
at
the
i
see
hello
here
s
mcguire
ferdinand
with
a
look
ushered
in
a
boy
with
red
hair
and
a
very
red
face
he
was
a
freckled
youth
and
his
bright
eyes
showed
quick
perception
as
they
darted
round
the
room
and
came
to
rest
on
miss
ames
on
whom
he
smiled
broadly
this
is
my
assistant
stone
said
casually
his
name
is
terence
mcguire
and
he
is
an
invaluable
help
anything
doing
son
not
partickler
kin
i
sit
and
listen
clearly
the
lad
was
embarrassed
probably
at
the
unaccustomed
luxury
of
his
surroundings
and
the
presence
of
so
many
strangers
for
terence
or
fibsy
as
he
was
nicknamed
was
a
child
of
the
streets
and
though
a
clever
assistant
to
fleming
stone
in
his
career
the
boy
seldom
accompanied
his
employer
to
the
homes
of
the
aristocracy
when
he
did
do
so
he
was
seized
with
a
shyness
that
was
by
no
means
evident
when
he
was
in
his
more
congenial
surroundings
he
glanced
bashfully
at
eunice
attracted
by
her
beauty
but
afraid
to
look
at
her
attentively
he
gazed
at
mason
elliott
with
a
more
frank
curiosity
and
then
he
cast
a
furtive
look
at
aunt
abby
who
was
herself
smiling
at
him
it
was
a
genial
smile
for
the
old
lady
had
a
soft
spot
in
her
heart
for
boys
and
was
already
longing
to
give
him
some
fruit
and
nuts
from
the
sideboard
fibsy
seemed
to
divine
her
attitude
and
he
grinned
affably
and
was
more
at
his
ease
but
he
sat
quietly
while
the
others
went
on
discussing
the
details
of
the
case
eunice
was
amazed
at
such
a
strange
partner
for
the
great
man
but
she
quickly
thought
that
a
street
urchin
like
that
could
go
to
places
and
learn
of
side
issues
in
ways
which
the
older
man
could
not
compass
so
conveniently
presently
fibsy
slipped
from
his
seat
and
quietly
went
into
the
bedrooms
eunice
raise
her
eyebrows
slightly
but
fleming
stone
observing
said
don
t
mind
embury
the
lad
is
all
right
i
ll
vouch
for
a
queer
helper
remarked
elliott
yes
but
very
i
rely
on
him
in
many
ways
and
he
almost
never
fails
to
help
me
he
s
now
looking
over
the
bedrooms
just
as
i
did
and
he
ll
disturb
mercy
me
exclaimed
aunt
abby
maybe
he
won
t
but
i
don
t
like
boys
prowling
among
my
things
and
she
scurried
after
him
she
found
him
in
her
room
and
rather
gruffly
said
what
are
you
up
to
boy
snuff
ma
am
he
replied
with
a
comical
wink
which
ought
to
have
shocked
the
old
lady
but
which
somehow
had
a
contrary
effect
do
you
like
candy
she
asked
unnecessarily
she
knew
and
offered
him
a
box
from
a
drawer
fibsy
felt
that
a
verbal
answer
was
not
called
for
and
helping
himself
proceeded
to
munch
the
sweets
contentedly
and
continuously
say
he
burst
out
after
a
thoughtful
study
of
the
room
where
was
that
there
dropper
thing
found
anyhow
in
this
medicine
chest
naw
i
mean
where
d
the
girl
find
it
the
housework
you
seem
to
know
a
lot
about
the
matter
sure
i
do
where
d
you
say
right
here
and
aunt
abby
pointed
to
a
place
on
the
rug
near
the
head
of
her
bed
it
was
a
narrow
bed
which
had
been
brought
there
for
her
during
her
stay
huh
now
you
could
a
dropped
it
there
i
know
and
aunt
abby
whispered
nobody
ll
believe
me
but
i
know
you
do
say
you
re
some
wiz
spill
it
to
me
there
s
a
dear
fibsy
was
in
his
way
a
psychologist
and
he
knew
by
instinct
that
this
old
lady
would
like
him
better
if
he
retained
his
ignorant
untutored
ways
than
if
he
used
the
more
polished
speech
which
he
had
painstakingly
acquired
for
other
kinds
of
occasions
i
wonder
if
you
d
understand
for
a
boy
you
re
a
bright
one
oh
yes
ma
am
i
am
they
don
t
make
em
no
brighter
n
me
try
me
do
miss
ames
i
m
right
there
with
the
well
child
it
s
this
i
saw
a
a
vision
yes
m
i
know
i
mean
i
know
what
visions
are
they
re
fine
too
he
fairly
smacked
his
lips
in
gusto
and
it
encouraged
aunt
abby
to
proceed
yes
and
it
was
the
ghost
of
who
do
you
suppose
it
was
your
grandmother
ma
am
the
boy
s
attitude
was
eagerly
attentive
and
his
freckled
little
face
was
drawn
in
a
desperate
interest
no
aunt
abby
drew
closer
and
just
breathed
the
words
mr
embury
oh
fibsy
was
really
startled
and
his
eyes
opened
wide
as
he
urged
go
on
ma
am
yes
well
it
was
just
at
the
moment
that
embury
was
that
he
died
you
yes
m
they
always
comes
then
ma
am
i
know
it
and
oh
child
this
is
a
true
story
oh
yes
ma
am
i
know
it
is
indeed
one
could
scarcely
doubt
it
for
aunt
abby
having
found
an
interested
listener
at
last
poured
forth
her
account
of
her
strange
experience
not
caring
for
comment
or
explanation
since
she
had
found
some
one
who
believed
yes
it
was
just
at
that
time
i
know
because
it
was
almost
daylight
just
before
dawn
and
i
was
asleep
but
not
entirely
asleep
sort
a
half
dozing
yes
and
sanford
embury
you
know
came
gliding
through
my
room
and
he
stopped
at
my
bedside
to
say
was
he
alive
asked
fibsy
at
her
hushed
tones
and
bright
glittering
eyes
oh
no
it
was
his
spirit
you
see
his
disembodied
spirit
how
could
you
see
it
then
when
spirits
appear
like
that
they
are
oh
ma
am
i
didn
t
yes
and
i
not
only
saw
him
but
he
was
evident
to
all
my
five
senses
what
ma
am
what
do
you
mean
fibsy
drew
back
a
little
scared
as
aunt
abby
clutched
his
sleeve
in
her
excitement
he
felt
uneasy
for
it
was
growing
dusk
and
the
old
lady
was
in
such
a
state
of
nervous
exhilaration
that
he
shrank
a
little
from
her
proximity
but
fibsy
was
game
go
on
ma
am
he
whispered
yes
aunt
abby
declared
with
an
eerie
smile
of
triumph
i
saw
him
i
heard
him
i
felt
him
i
smelled
him
and
i
tasted
him
fibsy
nearly
shrieked
for
at
each
enumeration
of
her
marvelous
experiences
miss
ames
grasped
his
arm
tighter
and
emphasized
her
statements
by
pounding
on
his
shoulder
she
seemed
unaware
of
his
personal
presence
she
talked
more
as
if
recounting
the
matter
to
herself
but
she
used
him
as
a
general
audience
and
the
boy
had
to
make
a
desperate
effort
to
preserve
his
poise
and
then
it
struck
him
that
the
old
lady
was
crazy
or
else
she
really
had
an
important
story
to
tell
in
either
case
it
was
his
duty
to
let
fleming
stone
hear
it
at
first
hand
if
possible
but
he
felt
sure
that
to
call
in
the
rest
of
the
household
or
to
take
the
narrator
out
to
them
would
as
he
expressed
it
to
himself
upset
her
applecart
and
spill
the
beans
chapter
xiv
the
five
senses
however
he
decided
quickly
it
must
be
done
so
he
said
diplomatically
this
is
awful
int
restin
miss
ames
and
i
m
just
dead
sure
and
certain
stone
d
think
so
too
let
s
go
out
and
get
it
off
where
he
c
n
hear
it
what
say
the
boy
had
risen
and
was
edging
toward
the
door
rather
than
lose
her
audience
aunt
abby
followed
and
in
a
moment
the
pair
appeared
in
the
where
fleming
stone
was
still
talking
to
eunice
and
elliott
miss
ames
now
she
s
got
somethin
worth
tellin
fibsy
announced
this
yarn
of
hers
is
pure
gold
and
a
yard
wide
stone
and
you
oughter
hear
it
gladly
and
stone
gave
aunt
abby
a
welcoming
smile
nothing
loath
to
achieve
the
center
of
the
stage
the
old
lady
seated
herself
in
her
favorite
and
began
it
was
almost
morning
she
said
a
faint
dawn
began
to
make
objects
about
the
room
visible
when
i
opened
my
eyes
and
saw
a
dim
gliding
figure
eunice
gave
an
angry
exclamation
and
rising
quickly
from
her
chair
walked
into
her
own
room
and
closed
the
door
with
a
slam
that
left
no
doubt
as
to
her
state
of
mind
let
her
alone
advised
elliott
she
s
better
off
in
there
what
is
this
story
aunt
abby
i
ve
never
heard
it
in
no
eunice
never
would
let
me
tell
it
but
it
will
solve
all
mystery
of
sanford
s
then
it
is
indeed
important
and
stone
looked
at
the
speaker
intently
yes
stone
it
will
prove
beyond
all
doubt
that
embury
was
a
go
on
then
said
elliott
briefly
i
will
in
the
half
light
i
saw
this
figure
i
just
mentioned
it
wasn
t
discernible
clearly
it
was
merely
a
moving
shadow
a
vague
shape
it
came
toward
me
from
which
direction
asked
stone
with
decided
interest
from
eunice
s
room
that
is
it
had
of
course
come
from
embury
s
room
through
eunice
s
room
and
so
on
into
my
room
for
it
was
sanford
embury
s
spirit
get
that
firmly
in
your
minds
the
old
lady
spoke
with
asperity
for
she
was
afraid
of
contradiction
and
resented
their
quite
apparent
scepticism
go
on
please
urged
stone
well
the
spirit
came
nearer
my
bed
and
paused
and
looked
down
on
me
where
i
did
you
see
his
face
asked
elliott
dimly
i
can
t
seem
to
make
you
understand
how
vague
the
whole
thing
was
and
yet
it
was
there
as
he
leaned
over
me
i
saw
him
saw
the
indistinct
shape
and
i
heard
the
sound
of
a
watch
ticking
it
was
not
my
watch
it
was
a
very
faint
ticking
one
but
all
else
was
so
still
that
i
positively
heard
gee
said
fibsy
in
an
explosive
whisper
then
he
seemed
about
to
move
away
impulsively
i
made
a
movement
to
detain
him
almost
without
volition
acting
on
instinct
i
put
out
my
hand
and
clutched
his
arm
i
felt
his
sleeve
it
wasn
t
a
coat
sleeve
nor
a
pajama
sleeve
it
seemed
to
have
on
his
gymnasium
suit
the
sleeve
was
like
woolen
jersey
and
you
felt
this
yes
stone
i
felt
it
distinctly
and
not
only
with
my
hand
as
i
grasped
at
his
arm
but
aunt
abby
hesitated
an
instant
then
went
on
but
i
bit
at
him
yes
i
did
i
don
t
know
why
only
i
was
possessed
with
an
impulse
to
hold
him
and
he
was
slipping
away
i
didn
t
realize
at
the
time
who
what
it
was
and
i
sort
of
thought
it
was
a
burglar
but
anyway
i
bit
at
him
and
so
i
bit
at
the
woolen
sleeve
it
was
unmistakable
and
on
it
i
tasted
raspberry
what
cried
her
hearers
almost
in
concert
yes
you
needn
t
laugh
i
guess
i
know
the
taste
of
raspberry
jam
and
it
was
on
that
sleeve
as
sure
as
i
m
sitting
here
gee
repeated
fibsy
his
fists
clenched
on
his
knees
and
his
bright
eyes
fairly
boring
into
the
old
lady
s
countenance
gee
whiz
go
on
said
stone
quietly
and
i
smelt
gasoline
concluded
miss
ames
defiantly
now
sir
there
s
the
story
make
what
you
will
out
of
it
it
s
every
word
true
i
ve
thought
it
over
and
over
since
i
realized
what
it
all
meant
and
had
i
known
at
the
time
it
was
sanford
s
spirit
i
should
have
spoken
to
him
but
as
it
was
i
was
too
stunned
to
speak
and
when
i
tried
to
hold
him
he
slipped
away
and
disappeared
but
it
was
positively
a
materialization
of
sanford
embury
s
flitting
spirit
and
nothing
the
vision
may
argue
a
passing
soul
stone
said
kindly
as
if
humoring
her
but
the
effect
on
your
other
senses
seems
to
me
to
indicate
a
living
no
and
aunt
abby
spoke
with
deep
solemnity
a
materialized
spirit
is
evident
to
our
senses
one
or
another
of
them
in
this
case
i
discerned
it
by
all
five
senses
which
is
unusual
possibly
unique
but
i
am
very
psychic
very
sensitive
to
spiritual
you
have
seen
ghosts
before
then
oh
yes
i
have
visions
often
but
never
such
a
strange
and
where
did
this
spirit
disappear
to
it
just
faded
it
seemed
to
waft
on
across
the
room
i
closed
my
eyes
involuntarily
and
when
i
opened
them
again
it
was
leaving
no
trace
behind
the
faint
odor
of
gasoline
and
the
taste
of
raspberry
jam
on
my
fibsy
snickered
but
suppressed
it
at
once
and
said
and
he
left
the
little
beside
your
bed
yes
boy
you
seem
clairvoyant
yourself
he
did
it
was
sanford
of
course
he
had
killed
himself
with
the
poison
and
he
tried
to
tell
me
so
but
he
couldn
t
make
any
communication
they
rarely
can
so
he
left
the
tiny
implement
that
we
might
know
and
h
m
yes
and
stone
sat
thinking
now
miss
ames
you
must
not
be
offended
at
what
i
m
about
to
say
i
don
t
disbelieve
your
story
at
all
you
tell
it
too
honestly
for
that
i
fully
believe
you
saw
what
you
call
a
but
you
have
thought
over
it
and
brooded
over
it
until
you
think
you
saw
more
than
you
did
or
less
but
leaving
that
aside
for
the
moment
i
want
you
to
realize
that
your
theory
of
suicide
based
on
the
vision
is
not
logical
supposing
your
niece
were
guilty
as
the
detectives
think
might
not
embury
s
spirit
have
pursued
the
same
course
aunt
abby
pondered
then
her
eyes
flashing
she
cried
do
you
mean
he
put
the
dropper
in
my
room
to
throw
suspicion
on
me
instead
of
on
his
wife
there
is
a
chance
for
such
a
sanford
wouldn
t
do
such
a
thing
he
was
truly
fond
of
me
but
to
save
his
wife
i
never
thought
of
all
that
maybe
he
did
or
maybe
he
dropped
the
thing
accidentally
stone
spoke
preoccupiedly
mason
elliott
too
sat
in
deep
thought
at
last
he
said
aunt
abby
if
i
were
you
i
wouldn
t
tell
that
yarn
to
anybody
else
let
s
all
forget
it
and
call
it
merely
a
what
do
you
mean
mason
the
old
lady
bridled
having
no
wish
to
hear
her
marvelous
experience
belittled
it
wasn
t
a
dream
not
an
ordinary
dream
it
was
a
true
appearance
of
sanford
after
his
death
you
know
such
things
do
happen
look
at
that
son
of
sir
oliver
lodge
you
don
t
doubt
that
do
you
never
mind
those
things
but
i
earnestly
beg
of
you
aunt
abby
to
forget
the
episode
or
at
least
to
promise
me
you
ll
not
repeat
it
to
any
one
why
i
think
it
wiser
for
all
concerned
for
all
concerned
that
the
tale
shall
not
become
public
but
why
oh
my
land
burst
out
fibsy
don
t
you
see
the
ghost
was
embury
the
boy
had
put
into
words
what
was
in
the
thoughts
of
both
stone
and
elliott
they
realized
that
while
aunt
abby
s
experience
might
have
been
entirely
a
dream
it
was
so
circumstantial
as
to
indicate
a
real
occurrence
and
in
that
case
what
solution
so
plausible
as
that
eunice
after
committing
the
crime
wandered
into
her
aunt
s
room
and
whether
purposely
or
accidentally
dropped
the
implement
of
death
stone
bent
on
investigation
plied
miss
ames
with
questions
elliott
sorely
afraid
for
eunice
begged
the
old
lady
not
to
answer
you
are
inventing
he
cried
you
are
drawing
on
your
imagination
don
t
believe
all
that
stone
it
isn
t
fair
to
to
embury
then
you
see
it
as
i
do
elliott
and
stone
turned
to
him
quickly
but
even
so
we
must
look
into
this
story
suppose
as
an
experiment
we
build
up
a
case
against
embury
for
the
purpose
of
knocking
it
down
again
a
man
of
straw
you
don
t
pleaded
elliott
just
forget
the
rigmarole
of
the
nocturnal
vision
and
devote
your
energies
to
finding
the
real
murderer
i
have
a
theory
wait
elliott
i
fear
you
are
an
interested
investigator
don
t
forget
that
you
have
been
mentioned
as
one
of
those
with
motive
but
no
since
you
have
raised
that
issue
stone
let
me
say
right
here
that
my
regard
for
embury
is
very
great
it
is
also
honorable
and
lifelong
i
make
no
secret
of
it
but
i
declare
to
you
that
its
very
purity
and
intensity
puts
it
far
above
and
beyond
any
suspicion
of
being
motive
for
the
murder
of
embury
s
mason
elliott
looked
fleming
stone
straight
in
the
eye
and
the
speaker
s
tone
and
expression
carried
a
strong
conviction
of
sincerity
fibsy
too
scrutinized
elliott
good
egg
he
observed
to
himself
trouble
is
he
d
give
us
that
same
song
and
dance
if
he
d
croaked
the
guy
his
own
self
furthermore
stone
went
on
mrs
embury
shows
a
peculiarly
strong
repugnance
to
hearing
this
story
of
miss
ames
experience
that
looks
oh
fiddlesticks
cried
miss
ames
who
had
been
listening
in
amazement
it
wasn
t
eunice
why
would
she
rig
up
in
sanford
s
gym
jersey
why
wouldn
t
she
countered
stone
as
i
said
we
re
building
up
a
supposititious
case
assume
that
it
was
embury
not
at
all
enacting
a
ghost
but
merely
wandering
around
after
her
impulsive
deed
for
if
she
is
the
guilty
party
it
must
have
been
an
impulsive
deed
you
know
her
uncontrollable
temper
her
sudden
spasms
of
rage
mr
stone
a
man
of
straw
as
you
call
it
is
much
more
easily
built
up
than
knocked
elliott
spoke
sternly
i
hold
you
have
no
right
to
assume
embury
s
identity
in
this
story
miss
ames
is
there
anything
that
points
to
her
in
your
discernment
by
your
five
senses
miss
ames
stone
asked
very
gravely
has
embury
a
faintly
ticking
watch
yes
her
aunt
abby
answered
though
speaking
evidently
against
her
will
and
it
is
possible
that
she
slipped
on
her
husband
s
jersey
and
it
is
possible
there
was
raspberry
jam
on
the
sleeve
of
it
you
see
i
am
not
doubting
the
evidence
of
your
senses
now
as
to
the
gasoline
had
embury
or
her
maid
by
any
chance
been
cleaning
any
laces
or
finery
with
gasoline
i
won
t
tell
you
and
aunt
abby
shook
her
head
so
obstinately
that
it
was
quite
equivalent
to
an
affirmative
answer
now
you
see
aunt
abby
protested
elliott
in
an
agonized
voice
why
i
want
you
to
shut
up
about
that
confounded
vision
you
are
responsible
for
this
case
stone
is
so
ingeniously
building
up
against
eunice
you
are
getting
her
into
a
desperate
coil
from
which
it
will
be
difficult
to
extricate
her
if
shane
got
hold
of
this
absurd
yarn
it
s
not
entirely
absurd
broke
in
stone
but
i
agree
with
you
elliott
if
shane
learns
of
it
he
won
t
investigate
any
further
he
shan
t
know
of
it
was
the
angry
retort
i
got
you
here
stone
to
discover
the
truth
or
to
free
embury
there
was
a
pause
and
the
two
men
looked
at
each
other
then
mason
elliott
said
in
a
low
voice
to
free
i
can
t
take
the
case
that
way
stone
replied
i
will
abandon
the
whole
affair
or
i
will
find
out
the
abandon
it
cried
a
ringing
voice
and
the
door
of
her
bedroom
was
flung
open
as
eunice
again
appeared
she
was
in
a
towering
fury
her
face
was
white
and
her
lips
compressed
to
a
straight
scarlet
line
give
up
the
case
i
will
take
my
chances
with
any
judge
or
jury
rather
than
with
you
she
faced
stone
like
the
tiger
her
husband
had
nicknamed
her
i
have
heard
every
word
aunt
abby
s
story
and
your
conclusions
your
despicable
deductions
as
i
suppose
you
call
them
i
ve
had
enough
of
the
celebrated
detective
quite
enough
of
fleming
stone
and
his
work
she
stepped
back
and
gazed
at
him
with
utter
scorn
beautiful
as
a
sculptured
medea
haughty
as
a
tragedy
queen
independent
as
a
pig
on
ice
fibsy
communicated
with
himself
and
he
stared
at
her
with
undisguised
admiration
eunice
and
the
pain
in
mason
elliott
s
voice
was
noticeable
eunice
dear
don
t
do
yourself
such
why
not
when
everybody
is
unjust
to
me
you
mason
you
and
this
this
infallible
detective
sit
here
and
deliberately
build
up
what
you
call
a
case
against
me
me
eunice
embury
oh
i
hate
you
all
a
veritable
figure
of
hate
incarnate
she
stood
her
white
hands
clasping
each
other
tightly
as
they
hung
against
her
black
gown
her
head
held
high
her
whole
attitude
fiercely
defiant
she
flung
out
her
words
with
a
bitterness
that
betokened
the
end
of
her
endurance
the
limit
of
her
patience
then
her
hands
fell
apart
her
whole
body
drooped
and
sinking
down
on
the
wide
sofa
she
sat
hopelessly
facing
them
but
with
head
erect
and
the
air
of
one
vanquished
but
very
much
unsubdued
take
that
back
eunice
elliott
spoke
passionately
and
quite
as
if
there
were
no
others
present
you
do
not
hate
me
i
am
here
to
help
you
you
can
t
mason
no
one
can
help
me
no
one
can
protect
me
from
fleming
stone
the
name
was
uttered
with
such
scorn
as
to
seem
an
invective
of
itself
stone
betrayed
no
annoyance
at
her
attitude
toward
him
but
rather
seemed
impressed
with
her
personality
he
gave
her
a
glance
that
was
not
untinged
with
admiration
but
he
made
no
defence
i
can
cried
fibsy
who
was
utterly
routed
by
eunice
s
imperious
beauty
you
go
ahead
with
stone
ma
am
and
i
ll
see
to
it
that
they
ain
t
no
injustice
done
to
you
stone
looked
at
his
excited
young
assistant
with
surprise
and
then
contented
himself
with
a
shake
of
his
head
and
a
careful
yes
sir
but
oh
stone
and
then
at
a
gesture
from
the
great
detective
the
boy
paused
abashed
and
remained
silent
now
miss
ames
stone
began
in
embury
s
presence
i
ll
ask
you
you
won
t
ask
me
anything
sir
she
returned
crisply
i
m
going
out
i
ve
a
very
important
errand
to

don
t
know
about
that
elliott
said

almost
six
o
clock

mason
you

be
sorry
if

even
as
she
spoke
the
old
lady
was
scurrying
to
her
room
from
which
she
returned
shortly
garbed
for
the
street
all
right
stone
said
in
reply
to
a
whisper
from
fibsy
and
the
boy
offered
respectfully

me
go
with
you
miss
ames

t
fittin

go
alone
it
s
most
come
on

regarded
him
kindly
i
d
be
glad
of
your
at
the
street
door
the
old
lady
asked
for
a
taxicab
and
the
strangely
assorted
pair
were
soon
on
their
way
you
re
a
bright
lad
fibsy
she
said

the
way

the
plain
unvarnished
but

tittle
to
that
ghost
story

every
bit
on
the
dead
level

his
question

word

chapter
xv
marigny
the
medium
the
journey
ended
at
the
rooms
of
marigny
the
psychic
recommended
by
willy
hanlon
as
fibsy
his
bright
eyes
wide
with
wonder
found
himself
in
the
unmistakable
surroundings
of
dingy
draperies
a
curtained
cabinet
and
an
odor
of
burning
incense
he
exclaimed
to
himself
gee
a
clairviant
now
for
some
fun
aunt
abby
apparently
aware
of
the
proprieties
of
the
occasion
seated
herself
and
waited
patiently
at
a
gesture
from
her
fibsy
obediently
took
a
seat
near
her
and
waited
quietly
too
soon
the
psychic
entered
he
was
robed
in
a
long
black
garment
and
wore
a
heavy
white
turban
swathed
in
folds
his
face
was
what
was
visible
of
it
for
his
beard
was
white
and
flowing
and
a
heavy
drooping
moustache
fell
over
his
lips
locks
of
white
hair
showed
from
the
turban
s
edge
and
a
pair
of
big
glasses
of
an
amber
tint
partially
hid
his
eyes
the
whole
was
false
it
was
clear
to
be
seen
but
a
psychic
has
a
right
to
disguise
himself
if
he
choose
fibsy
gave
marigny
one
quick
glance
and
then
the
boy
assumed
an
expression
of
face
quite
different
from
his
usual
one
he
managed
to
look
positively
his
eyes
became
his
mouth
slightly
open
looked
almost
imbecile
and
his
roving
glance
betokened
no
interest
whatever
in
the
proceedings
mr
marigny
said
miss
ames
eagerly
anxious
for
the
s√©ance
to
begin
yes
madam
you
are
three
minutes
late
i
couldn
t
help
it
the
traffic
is
very
heavy
at
this
and
you
should
have
come
alone
i
can
not
concentrate
with
an
alien
influence
in
the
oh
the
boy
isn
t
an
alien
influence
he
s
a
little
friend
of
mine
he
ll
do
no
i
ll
go
out
if
you
say
mister
fibsy
turned
his
indifferent
gaze
on
the
clairvoyant
you
ll
do
nothing
of
the
sort
spoke
up
miss
ames
i
m
accustomed
to
s√©ances
marigny
and
if
you
re
all
right
as
i
was
told
you
were
a
child
s
presence
won
t
evidently
the
psychic
saw
he
had
no
novice
to
deal
with
and
he
accepted
the
situation
what
do
you
want
to
know
he
asked
his
client
who
killed
sanford
embury
or
did
he
kill
himself
i
want
you
to
get
into
communication
with
his
spirit
and
find
out
from
him
but
i
don
t
want
any
if
you
can
t
succeed
that
s
all
right
i
ll
pay
your
fee
just
the
same
but
no
that
s
the
way
to
look
at
it
madam
i
will
go
into
the
silence
and
i
will
give
you
only
such
information
as
i
get
the
man
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
gradually
seemed
to
enter
a
hypnotic
state
his
muscles
relaxed
his
face
became
still
and
set
and
his
breathing
was
slow
and
a
little
labored
fibsy
retained
his
vacuous
look
he
even
fidgeted
a
little
in
a
bored
way
and
rarely
glanced
toward
the
man
of
clear
miss
ames
though
anxious
for
results
was
alert
and
quite
on
her
guard
against
fraud
experienced
in
fake
mediums
she
believed
willy
hanlon
s
assertion
that
this
man
was
one
of
the
few
genuine
mystics
but
she
proposed
to
judge
for
herself
at
last
marigny
spoke
his
voice
was
low
his
tones
monotonous
and
uninflected
aunt
abby
aunt
westminster
abbey
the
words
came
slowly
miss
ames
gave
a
startled
jump
her
face
blanched
and
she
trembled
as
she
clutched
fibsy
s
arm
that
s
what
sanford
used
to
call
me
she
whispered
can
it
really
be
his
spirit
talking
to
me
through
the
medium
don
t
worry
the
voice
went
on
don
t
grieve
for
me
it
s
all
right
let
it
go
that
i
took
my
own
life
but
did
you
sanford
did
you
miss
ames
implored
it
would
be
better
you
should
never
i
must
know
i
ve
got
to
know
tell
me
sanford
it
wasn
t
eunice
no
it
wasn
t
was
it
oh
san
was
it
i
yes
aunt
abby
it
was
but
you
were
entirely
irresponsible
you
were
asleep
hypnotized
perhaps
perhaps
merely
where
did
i
get
the
stuff
i
think
somebody
hypnotized
you
and
gave
it
to
you
when
where
i
don
t
know
it
is
vague
uncertain
but
you
put
it
in
my
ear
remember
aunt
abby
i
don
t
blame
you
at
all
and
you
must
not
tell
this
you
must
let
it
go
as
suicide
that
is
the
only
way
to
save
yourself
but
they
suspect
eunice
they
ll
never
convict
her
nor
would
they
convict
you
tell
them
you
got
into
communication
with
my
spirit
and
i
said
it
was
ask
him
about
the
raspberry
jam
put
in
fibsy
in
a
stage
whisper
what
the
medium
came
out
of
his
trance
suddenly
and
glared
at
the
boy
i
told
you
i
could
do
nothing
if
the
child
stayed
here
marigny
cried
evidently
in
a
towering
passion
put
him
out
who
is
he
what
is
he
talking
about
nothing
of
importance
keep
still
mcguire
can
you
get
embury
s
spirit
back
sir
no
the
communion
is
too
greatly
disturbed
boy
what
do
you
mean
by
raspberry
jam
oh
nothin
and
fibsy
wriggled
bashfully
you
tell
him
miss
it
needed
little
encouragement
to
launch
aunt
abby
on
the
story
of
her
vision
and
she
told
it
in
full
detail
marigny
seemed
interested
though
a
little
impatient
and
tried
to
hurry
the
recital
it
was
without
doubt
embury
s
spirit
he
said
as
aunt
abby
finished
but
your
imagination
has
exaggerated
and
elaborated
the
facts
for
instance
i
think
the
jam
and
the
gasoline
are
added
by
your
fancy
in
order
to
fill
out
the
full
tale
of
your
five
that
s
what
i
thought
and
fibsy
nodded
his
head
raspberry
jam
oh
gee
he
exploded
in
a
burst
of
silly
laughter
marigny
looked
at
him
with
a
new
interest
the
glasses
turned
toward
the
boy
seemed
to
frighten
him
and
he
began
to
whimper
i
didn
t
mean
any
harm
he
said
but
raspberry
jam
was
so
funny
for
a
ghost
to
have
on
him
it
would
have
been
assented
marigny
but
that
i
feel
sure
existed
only
in
miss
ames
fancy
her
mind
upset
by
the
vision
had
strange
hallucinations
and
the
jam
was
one
you
know
we
often
have
grotesque
so
we
do
agreed
fibsy
why
once
i
drempt
that
excuse
me
young
sir
but
i
ve
no
time
to
listen
to
your
dreams
the
s√©ance
is
at
an
end
madam
your
companion
probably
cut
it
off
prematurely
but
perhaps
not
perhaps
the
communication
was
about
over
anyway
are
you
satisfied
miss
ames
yes
marigny
i
know
the
appearance
of
embury
was
a
genuine
visitation
for
he
called
me
by
a
peculiar
name
which
no
one
else
ever
used
and
which
you
could
not
possibly
know
that
is
indeed
a
positive
test
i
am
glad
you
received
what
you
wished
for
the
fee
is
ten
dollars
aunt
abby
paid
it
willingly
enough
and
with
fibsy
took
her
departure
on
reaching
home
they
found
alvord
hendricks
there
mason
elliott
had
tarried
and
fleming
stone
too
was
still
there
eunice
was
awaiting
aunt
abby
s
return
to
have
dinner
served
i
thought
you
d
never
come
auntie
said
eunice
greeting
her
warmly
eunice
was
in
a
most
pleasant
mood
and
seemed
to
have
become
entirely
reconciled
to
the
presence
of
stone
you
will
dine
here
too
terence
she
said
kindly
to
the
boy
who
replied
yes
ma
am
very
respectfully
well
eunice
aunt
abby
announced
after
they
were
seated
at
the
table
i
m
the
criminal
after
you
seem
pretty
cheerful
about
it
said
hendricks
looking
at
her
in
astonishment
well
i
wasn
t
responsible
i
did
it
under
compulsory
you
owned
up
to
it
before
aunt
abby
said
eunice
humoring
her
you
said
i
know
eunice
but
that
time
it
was
to
shield
you
now
i
know
for
certain
that
i
did
do
it
and
how
it
came
dear
aunt
abby
and
elliott
spoke
very
gently
don
t
you
talk
about
it
any
more
your
vagaries
are
tolerated
by
us
who
love
you
but
stone
is
bored
by
them
not
at
all
said
fleming
stone
on
the
contrary
i
m
deeply
interested
tell
me
all
about
it
miss
ames
where
have
you
been
thus
encouraged
aunt
abby
told
all
she
described
the
s√©ance
truthfully
fibsy
s
bright
eyes
not
now
darting
glances
at
her
and
at
stone
as
the
tale
proceeded
he
was
the
real
thing
wasn
t
he
mcguire
miss
ames
appealed
to
him
at
last
you
bet
why
if
the
side
wire
of
his
beard
hadn
t
fetched
loose
and
if
his
walnut
juice
complexion
hadn
t
stopped
a
mite
short
of
his
collar
i
d
a
took
him
for
a
oriental
don
t
be
so
impertinent
terence
reproved
stone
miss
ames
knows
better
than
you
it
doesn
t
matter
that
he
was
made
up
that
way
aunt
abby
said
serenely
they
often
do
that
but
he
was
genuine
i
know
because
why
eunice
what
did
sanford
use
to
call
me
for
fun
aunt
what
aunt
westminter
abbey
said
eunice
smiling
at
the
recollection
yes
triumphantly
and
that
s
what
sanford
called
me
when
speaking
to
me
through
the
medium
isn
t
that
a
proof
how
could
that
man
know
that
i
can
t
explain
that
declared
elliott
a
little
shortly
but
it
s
all
rubbish
and
i
don
t
think
you
ought
to
be
allowed
to
go
to
such
places
it
s
disgraceful
you
hush
up
mason
miss
ames
cried
i
ll
go
where
i
like
i
m
not
a
child
and
too
i
wasn
t
alone
i
had
an
escort
a
very
nice
she
looked
kindly
at
fibsy
thank
you
ma
am
he
returned
bobbing
his
funny
red
head
i
sure
enjoyed
you
didn
t
look
so
you
looked
half
i
always
enjoy
myself
when
i
m
asleep
and
half
a
loaf
is
better
n
no
bed
the
boy
grinned
at
her
well
it
may
all
be
rubbish
alvord
hendricks
said
musingly
and
it
probably
is
but
there
are
people
mason
who
don
t
think
so
anyway
here
s
my
idea
if
aunt
abby
thinks
she
poisoned
sanford
under
hypnotism
or
any
other
way
for
the
love
of
heaven
let
it
go
at
that
if
you
don
t
suspicion
will
turn
back
to
eunice
again
and
that
s
what
we
want
to
prevent
now
no
jury
would
ever
convict
an
old
lady
nor
any
woman
said
elliott
but
that
isn
t
the
whole
thing
i
say
alvord
since
stone
is
on
the
job
suppose
we
give
him
full
swing
and
let
him
find
the
real
murderer
it
wasn
t
eunice
his
words
rang
out
so
vibrantly
that
stone
gave
him
a
quick
glance
you
re
sure
he
asked
as
it
seemed
involuntarily
i
am
responded
elliott
with
a
satisfied
nod
of
his
handsome
head
but
your
being
sure
doesn
t
help
much
mason
eunice
said
a
despondent
look
coming
into
her
eyes
are
you
sure
stone
i
can
t
quite
answer
that
question
yet
embury
the
courteous
voice
replied
remember
i
ve
only
just
begun
to
look
into
the
but
you
know
all
about
it
from
shane
and
i
know
what
they
think
about
it
but
that
s
a
different
you
don
t
agree
with
their
deductions
then
asked
hendricks
i
don
t
agree
with
their
premises
therefore
stone
smiled
cryptically
and
left
the
sentence
unfinished
and
ambiguous
which
was
his
deliberate
intention
we
will
have
coffee
in
the
said
eunice
as
she
rose
from
the
table
always
a
charming
hostess
she
was
at
her
best
her
thin
black
gown
was
becoming
and
made
her
fair
throat
and
arms
seem
even
whiter
by
contrast
she
stood
back
as
the
others
left
the
room
and
hendricks
tarrying
too
came
close
to
her
brace
up
dear
he
said
it
will
all
come
out
right
i
m
sorry
elliott
dragged
in
this
stone
but
it
will
be
all
right
but
it
s
all
so
mysterious
alvord
i
don
t
know
what
to
do
or
say
don
t
lose
your
temper
eunice
let
me
advise
you
strongly
as
to
that
it
never
does
any
good
it
militates
against
you
and
here
s
another
thing
are
you
afraid
of
the
little
desternay
afraid
how
but
eunice
paled
afraid
she
knows
something
oh
something
injurious
to
to
me
she
knows
heaps
the
haughty
head
tossed
and
eunice
looked
defiant
you
beauty
and
hendricks
took
a
step
nearer
oh
you
splendid
thing
how
i
adore
you
eunice
you
are
a
goddess
and
you
are
for
me
some
day
oh
i
m
not
going
to
say
it
now
t
look
so
alarmed
but
you
know
oh
sweet
you
know
and
you
yes
you
too
my
splendid
tiger
hush
alvord
never
call
me
that
no
i
beg
pardon
and
i
don
t
want
to
that
was
san
s
own
name
for
you
i
shall
call
you
my
queen
my
glorious
oh
stop
don
t
you
dare
make
love
to
me
and
don
t
you
dare
say
dare
to
me
i
dare
all
ferdinand
s
entrance
cut
short
this
dialogue
and
eunice
and
hendricks
went
into
the
other
room
almost
immediately
a
visitor
was
announced
and
hanlon
came
in
why
hanlon
eunice
said
greeting
him
cordially
i
m
glad
to
see
you
so
am
i
cried
aunt
abby
hastening
to
welcome
the
newcomer
oh
hanlon
i
went
to
see
your
man
marigny
you
know
yes
i
called
to
see
if
you
had
found
him
all
the
necessary
introductions
were
made
and
hanlon
took
his
place
in
the
group
he
was
a
little
ill
at
ease
for
he
was
by
no
means
a
member
of
society
and
though
he
had
been
at
the
embury
house
before
he
seemed
a
trifle
in
awe
of
his
surroundings
and
i
called
too
hanlon
said
to
offer
you
my
respectful
sympathy
embury
and
ask
if
there
s
anything
i
can
do
for
why
you
re
very
kind
said
eunice
touched
by
his
thoughtfulness
but
i
m
afraid
there
s
nothing
you
anybody
can
do
for
f
stone
can
declared
fibsy
he
can
do
a
lot
for
you
the
red
head
nodded
vigorously
as
was
the
boy
s
habit
when
much
in
earnest
hanlon
regarded
him
closely
and
fibsy
returned
the
scrutiny
say
the
boy
broke
out
suddenly
i
ve
seen
you
before
you
re
the
man
who
found
the
hidden
jackknife
in
newark
the
same
and
hanlon
smiled
at
him
were
you
present
i
sure
was
gee
you
re
a
wonder
i
was
a
wonder
but
i
don
t
do
wonderful
things
any
what
do
you
do
now
yes
chimed
in
eunice
what
are
you
doing
hanlon
you
told
me
you
were
going
to
take
up
a
different
line
of
i
did
embury
i
m
a
prosaic
and
uninteresting
painter
man
an
artist
in
a
way
and
hanlon
smiled
i
paint
signs
and
i
try
to
do
them
signs
how
dull
for
you
after
your
exciting
performances
not
so
very
dull
interrupted
aunt
abby
i
know
about
the
signs
hanlon
paints
they
re
bigger
n
a
house
they
re
why
they
re
scenery
don
t
you
know
like
you
see
along
the
railroad
i
mean
along
the
meadows
when
you
re
riding
in
the
oh
scenic
advertising
observed
fleming
stone
and
signs
on
the
palisades
not
on
the
natural
scenery
laughed
hanlon
though
i
ve
been
tempted
by
high
rocks
or
are
you
a
asked
fibsy
his
eyes
sparkling
can
you
paint
spires
and
things
no
and
hanlon
looked
at
the
boy
regretfully
i
can
t
do
that
i
m
no
climber
i
make
the
signs
and
then
they
re
put
where
they
belong
by
other
oh
and
fibsy
looked
disappointed
at
not
finding
the
daring
hero
he
sought
for
i
must
not
presume
further
on
your
kindness
embury
hanlon
said
with
an
attempt
at
society
jargon
i
merely
called
in
for
a
minute
hendricks
are
you
going
my
way
i
want
to
see
you
about
that
no
hanlon
sorry
but
i
m
not
going
now
and
hendricks
shook
his
head
i
m
here
for
the
all
right
see
you
later
then
where
can
i
find
you
i
m
something
of
an
owl
i
ll
call
you
up
after
i
get
home
if
it
isn
t
too
late
hendricks
suggested
never
too
late
for
me
see
that
you
hanlon
looked
at
hendricks
with
more
seriousness
than
the
subject
appeared
to
call
for
then
he
went
away
you
got
the
earache
asked
fibsy
suddenly
of
hendricks
as
that
gentleman
half
absently
rubbed
his
ear
bless
my
soul
no
what
do
you
mean
by
such
a
question
stone
this
boy
of
yours
is
too
fresh
be
quiet
terence
said
stone
paying
but
slight
attention
to
the
matter
oh
all
right
no
offense
meant
and
the
boy
grinned
at
hendricks
but
didn
t
you
ever
have
an
earache
if
not
you
don
t
know
what
real
sufferin
is
no
i
never
had
it
that
i
remember
perhaps
as
a
child
why
alvord
said
aunt
abby
you
had
it
fearfully
about
a
month
ago
don
t
you
recollect
you
were
afraid
of
oh
that
well
that
was
a
serious
illness
i
was
thinking
of
an
ordinary
earache
when
i
said
i
never
had
one
but
i
beg
of
you
drop
the
subject
of
my
ailments
what
a
thing
to
discuss
true
enough
agreed
stone
i
propose
we
keep
to
the
theme
under
consideration
i
ve
been
engaged
to
look
into
this
murder
mystery
i
m
here
for
that
purpose
i
must
insist
that
i
conduct
my
investigation
in
my
own
that
s
the
right
talk
approved
elliott
now
stone
let
s
get
right
down
to
very
well
the
case
stands
thus
shane
says
and
it
s
perfectly
true
there
are
five
possible
suspects
but
only
one
of
these
had
both
motive
and
opportunity
now
the
whole
five
are
here
present
and
absurd
though
it
my
seem
i
m
going
to
ask
each
one
of
you
the
definite
question
ferdinand
he
raised
his
voice
and
the
butler
came
in
from
the
did
you
kill
your
master
no
god
hearing
me
i
didn
t
the
man
was
quiet
and
composed
though
his
face
was
agonized
that
will
do
you
may
go
said
stone
mr
elliott
did
you
kill
your
friend
your
partner
in
business
i
did
not
said
elliott
curtly
he
was
evidently
at
the
question
mr
hendricks
did
you
as
i
have
repeatedly
proved
i
was
in
boston
that
night
it
would
be
impossible
for
me
to
be
the
criminal
but
i
will
answer
your
ridiculous
query
i
did
mrs
embury
did
you
n
no
but
i
would
rather
be
suspected
than
to
have
you
said
no
i
believe
stone
interrupted
her
miss
ames
do
you
really
think
you
killed
your
niece
s
husband
oh
sir
i
don
t
know
i
can
t
think
i
did
of
course
you
didn
t
aunt
abby
mason
elliott
rose
from
his
seat
and
paced
up
and
down
the
room
i
must
say
stone
this
is
a
childish
performance
what
makes
you
think
any
of
us
would
say
so
if
we
had
killed
embury
it
is
utterly
absurd
you
re
absurd
elliott
cut
in
hendricks
mr
stone
is
a
psychologist
he
learns
what
he
wants
to
know
not
from
what
we
say
but
the
way
we
say
it
right
stone
right
stone
looked
grave
anything
more
to
say
elliott
yes
i
have
and
it
s
this
i
asked
you
to
come
here
i
asked
you
to
take
this
case
as
you
ve
already
surmised
to
free
embury
from
wrongful
suspicion
wrongful
mind
you
i
do
not
want
you
to
clear
her
if
she
is
guilty
but
she
isn
t
therefore
i
want
you
to
find
the
real
criminal
that
s
what
i
want
and
that
s
what
i
m
of
course
he
is
eunice
defended
him
i
wish
you
d
keep
still
mason
you
talk
too
much
and
you
interfere
with
stone
s
perhaps
i
d
better
go
home
elliott
was
clearly
offended
if
you
don
t
want
me
here
i
ll
oh
no
eunice
began
but
hendricks
said
go
on
elliott
do
there
are
too
many
of
us
here
and
as
eunice
s
counsel
i
can
look
after
her
mason
elliott
rose
and
turned
to
eunice
shall
i
go
he
said
and
he
gave
her
a
look
of
entreaty
a
look
of
yearning
pleading
love
go
she
said
coldly
alvord
will
take
care
of
and
elliott
went
chapter
xvi
fibsy
s
busy
day
it
s
this
way
stone
said
fibsy
earnestly
the
crooks
of
the
situation
the
what
the
crooks
that
s
what
they
call
it
oh
the
stone
did
not
laugh
yessir
if
that
s
how
you
pronounce
it
guess
i
ll
stick
to
plain
english
well
to
my
way
of
thinkin
the
little
joker
in
the
case
is
that
there
raspberry
jam
i
m
a
strong
believer
in
raspberry
jam
on
general
principles
but
in
pertikler
i
should
say
in
this
present
case
raspberry
jam
will
win
the
war
don
t
eat
it
thought
you
were
going
to
talk
plain
english
you
re
cryptic
my
all
right
here
goes
that
jam
business
is
straight
goods
the
old
lady
says
she
tasted
jam
and
she
did
taste
jam
that
s
all
there
is
about
that
and
that
sweet
pleasant
innercent
raspberry
jam
will
yet
send
the
moiderer
of
embury
to
the
chair
i
think
myself
there
s
something
to
be
looked
into
there
but
how
are
you
going
about
it
dunno
yet
but
here
s
another
thing
stone
that
i
ain
t
had
time
to
tell
you
yet
that
suppose
you
begin
at
the
beginning
and
tell
me
your
story
in
supposin
i
do
fibsy
thought
a
moment
before
he
began
it
was
the
morning
after
the
two
had
dined
at
the
embury
home
and
they
were
breakfasting
together
in
stone
s
hotel
apartment
well
stone
as
you
know
i
left
embury
s
last
night
d
eckly
after
hendricks
took
his
deeparture
as
i
s
pected
there
was
trouble
for
him
just
outside
the
street
doorway
that
hanlon
chap
was
standing
and
he
met
up
with
hendricks
much
to
the
dismay
of
the
latter
your
english
is
fine
this
morning
go
well
hanlon
fell
into
step
like
with
henricks
and
they
walked
along
hanlon
doing
the
talking
i
didn
t
dare
get
close
enough
to
overhear
them
for
they
re
both
live
wires
and
i
don
t
fool
either
of
em
into
thinking
meself
a
ninkypoop
so
i
trailed
but
well
out
a
sight
and
hold
on
stone
while
i
tell
you
this
the
fake
mejum
that
miss
ames
went
to
see
yesterday
afternoon
was
none
other
than
friend
hanlon
himself
what
fibs
are
you
sure
sure
as
shootin
i
spotted
him
the
minute
he
came
up
to
embury
s
i
didn
t
reckernize
him
at
first
as
the
whiskered
moses
but
i
did
later
you
know
stone
i
saw
him
do
stunts
for
newspapers
in
two
towns
and
i
wonder
i
didn
t
tumble
to
him
in
the
spookshop
but
i
didn
t
i
dessay
because
when
i
saw
him
doing
his
tricks
outdoors
he
was
blindfolded
which
some
concealed
his
natural
scenery
well
he
hadn
t
more
n
tripped
over
the
embury
welcome
mat
than
i
was
onto
him
me
thinker
woiked
light
lightnin
and
i
had
him
ticketed
and
pigeonholed
in
no
is
he
mixed
up
in
the
embury
case
he
s
mixed
up
with
hendricks
in
some
way
and
he
learned
from
miss
ames
that
hendricks
was
to
be
among
those
present
so
he
made
up
foolish
excuses
and
betook
himself
to
the
vicinity
of
said
why
wanted
to
converse
with
him
and
couldn
t
get
hold
of
him
otherwise
hendricks
it
would
seem
didn
t
hanker
for
said
i
remember
hanlon
asked
hendricks
if
he
were
going
his
way
and
hendricks
said
he
was
going
to
spend
the
evening
where
he
and
did
but
all
the
same
hanlon
waited
and
a
wait
of
an
hour
and
a
half
registers
patience
and
perseverance
to
my
right
you
are
and
you
trailed
the
pair
did
i
fibsy
fell
back
in
his
chair
as
if
exhausted
i
followed
them
to
hendricks
home
they
chatterin
glibly
all
the
way
and
then
after
a
few
minutes
further
remarks
on
the
doorstep
hendricks
he
went
in
and
hanlon
you
know
stone
hanlon
s
nobody
s
fool
and
he
knew
i
was
follerin
him
as
well
as
he
knew
his
name
i
don
t
know
how
he
knew
it
for
i
was
most
careful
to
keep
out
a
sight
but
all
the
same
he
did
know
it
and
what
do
you
think
he
did
he
led
me
a
chase
of
miles
and
miles
and
miles
that
s
what
he
did
on
purpose
on
purpose
laughin
in
his
silly
sleeve
i
was
game
i
trotted
along
but
bullieve
me
i
was
mad
and
the
galoot
was
so
slick
about
it
why
he
walked
up
broadway
first
as
if
he
had
a
business
appointment
in
a
desprit
hurry
then
having
reached
hunderd
an
th
street
he
pauses
a
minute
to
be
sure
i
m
trailin
the
vilyun
and
then
he
swings
east
and
across
town
and
turns
south
again
oh
well
stone
he
simpully
makes
me
foller
him
till
i
m
that
i
near
drops
in
my
tracks
and
to
top
the
heap
he
leads
me
straight
to
this
hotel
where
we
re
stayin
yes
sir
right
here
and
makin
a
sharp
turn
he
says
pleasant
like
and
scoots
off
can
you
beat
it
poor
old
fibs
that
was
an
experience
looks
like
the
hanlon
person
is
one
to
be
reckoned
with
but
it
doesn
t
prove
him
mixed
up
in
the
murder
mystery
in
any
no
sir
it
don
t
it
s
only
made
me
sore
on
him
and
sore
on
my
own
account
too
fibsy
grinned
ruefully
me
feet
s
that
blistered
and
i
m
lame
all
over
poor
boy
you
see
he
s
a
sprinter
from
way
back
his
stunts
on
that
newspaper
work
prove
he
can
take
long
walks
without
turning
a
yes
but
its
croolty
to
animiles
to
drag
a
young
feller
like
me
along
too
i
ve
got
his
number
just
you
wait
cele
remember
stone
he
played
to
miss
ames
that
means
something
it
does
indeed
this
is
a
great
old
case
fibsy
are
you
getting
a
line
on
it
i
think
so
sir
and
the
lad
looked
very
earnest
are
you
a
strange
one
but
yet
a
line
fibs
i
want
you
to
interview
that
desternay
you
can
do
it
better
than
i
jolly
her
along
and
find
out
if
she
s
friend
or
foe
of
yessir
an
kin
i
do
a
little
sleuthin
on
my
own
what
sort
legitermit
i
do
assure
you
when
fibsy
assumed
this
deeply
earnest
air
stone
knew
some
clever
dodge
was
in
his
mind
and
he
found
it
usually
turned
out
well
so
he
said
go
ahead
my
boy
i
trust
thank
yer
and
fibsy
devoted
himself
to
the
remainder
of
his
breakfast
while
stone
read
the
morning
paper
an
hour
later
terence
mcguire
presented
himself
at
the
embury
home
and
asked
for
miss
ames
good
morning
ma
am
he
said
as
he
smiled
brightly
at
her
howlja
like
to
join
me
in
a
bit
of
investergation
that
ll
proberly
end
up
in
a
s
lution
of
the
mystery
i
d
like
it
first
rate
replied
miss
ames
with
enthusiasm
when
do
we
begin
immejitly
where
s
mis
embury
in
her
no
use
her
but
i
want
a
see
the
jersey
the
gymnasium
jersey
your
ghost
aunt
abby
looked
disappointed
she
had
hoped
for
something
more
exciting
but
she
said
i
ll
get
it
and
went
at
once
to
sanford
embury
s
room
thank
you
said
fibsy
as
he
took
it
but
his
eager
scrutiny
failed
to
disclose
any
trace
of
jam
on
its
sleeves
which
arm
did
you
bite
he
asked
briefly
i
didn
t
really
bite
at
all
miss
ames
returned
i
sort
of
made
a
snap
at
him
it
was
more
a
nervous
gesture
than
an
intelligent
action
and
i
just
caught
a
bit
of
the
worsted
sleeve
between
my
lips
for
an
instant
it
was
let
me
see
it
must
have
been
the
left
arm
well
we
ll
examine
both
sleeves
and
i
regret
to
state
ma
am
there
s
no
sign
of
sticky
stuff
this
is
a
fine
specimen
of
a
jersey
i
never
saw
a
handsomer
one
but
there
s
no
stain
on
it
and
never
has
nor
has
it
ever
been
cleaned
with
gasoline
mused
miss
ames
and
yet
mcguire
nothing
to
my
dying
day
can
ever
convince
me
that
i
am
mistaken
on
those
two
subjects
i
m
just
as
sure
as
i
can
i
m
sure
too
listen
here
miss
ames
there
s
a
great
little
old
revelation
due
in
about
a
day
or
so
and
i
wish
you
d
lay
low
will
you
what
do
you
mean
why
don
t
do
or
say
much
about
the
affair
let
it
simmer
i
m
on
the
warpath
and
so
s
stone
and
we
re
comin
out
on
top
if
we
don
t
have
no
drawbacks
so
don
t
trot
round
to
clarviants
or
harp
on
that
there
vision
of
yours
will
you
my
boy
i
m
only
too
glad
to
keep
away
from
the
subject
i
m
worried
to
death
with
it
all
and
if
i
can
t
do
any
good
by
my
efforts
i
ll
willingly
lay
low
as
you
all
right
ma
am
now
i
m
off
and
i
ll
be
back
here
when
i
come
again
so
fibsy
went
down
in
the
service
elevator
and
forthwith
proceeded
to
interview
the
rubbish
man
of
the
house
and
some
other
functionaries
by
dint
of
much
prodding
of
memory
assisted
by
judicious
silver
offerings
he
finally
learned
that
there
was
an
apartment
occupied
by
a
couple
with
four
children
who
it
appeared
consumed
large
quantities
of
jam
of
all
flavors
at
least
their
rubbish
was
bristling
with
empty
jam
pots
and
the
deduction
was
logical
seemingly
unimpressed
fibsy
declared
it
was
he
was
searching
for
and
departed
outwardly
crestfallen
but
inwardly
elated
going
out
of
doors
he
walked
to
the
corner
of
park
avenue
and
turned
into
the
side
street
crossing
that
street
to
get
a
better
view
he
looked
up
the
side
of
the
big
apartment
house
and
his
gaze
paused
at
the
window
in
the
tenth
story
which
was
in
miss
ames
two
floors
below
this
was
the
apartment
of
the
family
who
were
reputed
jam
eaters
fibsy
looked
intently
at
all
the
windows
the
one
next
miss
ames
was
he
knew
in
the
embury
s
pantry
hence
the
one
two
stories
below
was
in
the
patterson
s
pantry
the
patterson
being
the
aforesaid
family
and
to
the
boy
s
astonished
and
delighted
eyes
there
on
the
pantry
sat
what
was
unmistakably
a
jam
jar
so
far
so
good
but
what
did
it
mean
fibsy
had
learned
that
patterson
was
a
member
of
the
metropolitan
athletic
club
and
was
greatly
interested
in
its
presidential
election
which
election
owing
to
the
death
of
one
of
the
candidates
had
been
indefinitely
postponed
but
further
investigation
of
patterson
was
too
serious
a
matter
for
the
boy
to
undertake
it
must
be
referred
to
fleming
stone
so
fibsy
glued
his
eyes
once
more
to
that
fascinating
jam
jar
up
on
the
and
slowly
walked
away
under
his
breath
he
was
singing
raz
berry
jam
raz
berry
jam
to
the
tune
of
a
certain
march
from
lohengrin
which
somehow
represented
to
his
idea
the
high
note
of
triumph
he
proceeded
along
the
cross
street
and
at
fifth
avenue
he
entered
a
bus
his
next
errand
took
him
to
the
home
of
fifi
desternay
by
some
ingenious
method
of
wheedling
he
persuaded
the
doorman
to
acquaint
the
lady
with
the
fact
of
his
presence
and
when
she
came
into
the
room
where
he
awaited
her
he
banked
on
his
nerve
to
induce
her
to
grant
him
an
interview
you
know
me
he
said
with
his
most
ingratiating
smile
and
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
take
her
beringed
little
hand
in
his
own
boyish
paw
i
do
not
she
declared
staring
at
him
and
then
his
grin
proving
infectious
she
added
not
unkindly
who
are
you
child
i
wish
i
was
a
society
reporter
or
a
photographer
or
anybody
who
could
do
justice
to
your
wonderful
charms
his
gaze
of
admiration
was
so
sincere
that
fifi
couldn
t
resent
it
she
often
looked
her
best
in
the
morning
and
her
dainty
negligee
and
bewitching
french
cap
made
her
a
lovely
picture
she
tucked
herself
into
a
big
cushioned
chair
and
drawing
a
nearer
fussed
with
its
silver
appointments
lem
me
ma
am
said
fibsy
eagerly
and
though
it
was
his
first
attempt
he
held
a
lighted
match
to
her
cigarette
with
real
grace
then
drawing
a
long
breath
of
relief
at
his
success
he
took
a
cigarette
himself
and
sat
near
her
well
she
began
what
s
it
all
about
and
do
tell
me
how
you
got
in
i
m
glad
you
did
though
it
was
against
orders
i
ve
not
seen
anything
so
amusing
as
you
for
a
long
time
this
is
my
amusin
day
returned
the
boy
imperturbably
i
came
to
talk
over
things
in
general
and
what
in
particular
fifi
was
enjoying
herself
she
felt
almost
sure
the
boy
was
a
reporter
of
a
new
sort
but
she
was
frankly
curious
well
ma
am
and
here
fibsy
changed
his
demeanor
to
a
stern
scowling
fierceness
i
m
a
special
he
rose
now
and
strode
about
the
room
i
m
engaged
on
the
embury
murder
case
and
i
m
here
to
ask
you
a
few
pointed
questions
about
my
heavens
cried
fifi
what
are
you
talking
about
don
t
scoff
at
me
ma
am
i
m
in
oh
well
go
ahead
why
are
you
questioning
me
it
s
this
way
ma
fibsy
sat
down
astride
a
chair
looking
over
the
back
of
it
at
his
hostess
you
and
embury
are
bosom
friends
i
from
whom
do
you
understand
it
was
the
tart
response
from
embury
in
a
manner
o
speakin
yes
and
then
again
no
but
aren
t
you
we
were
we
were
school
friends
and
have
been
intimates
for
years
but
since
her
trouble
embury
has
thrown
me
over
has
discarded
me
utterly
i
m
so
sorry
fifi
daintily
touched
her
eyes
with
a
tiny
square
of
monogrammed
linen
and
fibsy
said
gravely
careful
there
don
t
dab
your
eyelashes
too
hard
what
desternay
could
scarcely
believe
her
ears
honest
you
d
better
look
out
it
s
coming
off
nothing
of
the
sort
and
fifi
whipped
out
a
vanity
case
and
readjusted
her
cosmetic
adornment
then
i
take
it
you
two
are
not
friends
we
most
certainly
are
not
i
wouldn
t
do
anything
in
the
world
to
injure
eunice
embury
in
fact
i
d
help
her
even
now
though
she
scorned
my
assistance
but
we
re
not
friends
no
all
right
i
just
wanted
to
know
ask
right
out
that
s
my
it
seems
to
be
anything
else
you
are
thirsting
to
learn
yes
m
you
know
that
hamlet
performance
you
and
mis
embury
went
to
yes
said
fifi
cautiously
you
know
you
accused
her
of
talkin
it
over
with
you
she
did
yes
m
i
know
you
say
she
did
i
got
that
from
shane
but
lem
me
tell
you
ma
am
friendly
like
you
want
to
be
careful
how
you
tell
that
yarn
cause
they
s
chance
fer
a
perfectly
good
slander
case
against
you
what
nonsense
but
fifi
paled
a
little
under
her
delicate
rouge
no
nonsense
whatsomever
but
here
s
the
point
was
there
a
witness
to
that
conversation
why
let
me
see
we
talked
it
over
at
the
matinee
we
were
alone
then
but
yes
of
course
i
recollect
now
that
same
evening
eunice
was
here
and
hendricks
was
too
and
patterson
he
lives
in
their
apartment
house
the
embury
s
i
we
all
talked
about
it
there
i
guess
that
s
witnesses
enough
i
guess
it
is
but
take
it
from
me
lady
you
re
too
pretty
to
get
into
a
bothersome
lawsuit
and
i
advise
you
to
keep
on
the
sunny
side
of
the
street
and
let
these
shady
matters
i
ll
gladly
do
so
honest
i
don
t
want
to
get
eunice
in
bad
oh
no
we
all
know
you
don
t
want
to
get
her
in
bad
unless
it
can
be
done
with
abserlute
safety
to
your
own
precious
self
well
it
can
t
ma
am
you
keep
on
like
you
ve
begun
and
your
middle
name
ll
soon
be
trouble
good
morning
ma
fibsy
rose
bowed
and
left
the
room
so
suddenly
that
fifi
hadn
t
time
to
stop
him
if
she
had
wanted
to
and
he
left
behind
him
a
decidedly
scared
little
woman
fibsy
then
went
straight
to
the
offices
of
mason
elliott
he
was
admitted
and
given
an
audience
at
once
what
is
it
mcguire
asked
the
broker
a
lot
of
things
elliott
first
of
all
i
suppose
the
police
are
quite
satisfied
with
the
alibis
of
you
and
hendricks
yes
and
elliott
looked
curiously
into
the
grave
earnest
little
face
he
had
resented
at
first
the
work
of
this
boy
but
after
fleming
stone
had
explained
his
worth
elliott
soon
began
to
see
it
for
himself
they
are
unimpeachable
he
went
on
i
was
at
home
and
hendricks
was
in
boston
this
has
been
proved
over
and
over
by
many
witnesses
both
authentic
and
yes
fibsy
nodded
i
m
sure
of
it
too
and
of
course
that
lets
you
two
out
now
elliott
the
butler
didn
t
do
it
stone
says
that
s
a
fact
bringin
us
back
as
per
usual
to
the
two
ladies
but
elliott
neither
of
those
ladies
did
bless
you
my
boy
that
s
my
own
opinion
of
course
but
how
can
we
prove
it
fibsy
deeply
appreciated
the
we
and
gave
the
speaker
a
grateful
smile
there
you
are
elliott
how
can
we
stone
as
you
know
is
the
cleverest
detective
in
the
world
but
he
s
no
magician
he
can
t
find
the
truth
if
the
truth
is
hidden
in
a
place
he
can
t
get
have
you
any
idea
mcguire
who
the
murderer
was
no
sir
i
haven
t
but
i
ve
an
idea
where
to
get
an
idea
and
i
want
you
to
help
surely
that
goes
without
you
d
do
anything
for
embury
wouldn
t
you
the
simple
assertion
told
the
whole
story
and
fibsy
nodded
with
satisfaction
then
tell
me
truly
sir
please
wasn
t
embury
a
a
a
careful
there
he
s
dead
you
yes
i
know
but
it
s
necessary
sir
wasn
t
he
a
i
don
t
know
the
right
term
but
wasn
t
he
a
in
what
way
elliott
spoke
very
gravely
you
know
best
sir
he
was
your
partner
had
been
for
some
years
but
on
the
side
now
didn
t
he
do
this
lend
personally
you
know
on
and
if
he
did
didn
t
he
demand
big
security
didn
t
he
get
men
his
friends
even
in
his
power
and
then
come
down
on
em
oh
wasn
t
he
a
sort
of
a
loan
shark
where
did
you
get
all
this
i
put
together
odds
and
ends
of
talk
i
ve
heard
and
it
must
be
so
that
patterson
now
patterson
what
do
you
know
of
him
nothing
but
that
he
owed
embury
a
lot
and
his
household
stuff
was
the
collateral
and
were
did
you
learn
that
i
insist
on
knowing
servants
gossip
sir
i
picked
it
up
in
the
apartment
house
he
and
the
emburys
live
in
the
same
one
you
mcguire
you
are
on
a
wrong
trail
embury
may
have
lent
money
to
his
friends
may
have
had
collateral
security
from
them
probably
did
but
that
s
nothing
to
do
with
his
being
killed
and
as
it
is
a
blot
on
his
memory
i
do
not
want
the
matter
made
i
understand
that
elliott
neither
do
i
but
sposin
the
discovery
of
the
murderer
hinges
on
that
very
thing
that
very
branch
of
embury
s
business
then
mustn
t
it
be
looked
into
perhaps
it
must
but
not
by
no
sir

hanlon
s
ambition
an
important
feature
of
fleming
stone
s
efficiency
was
his
ability
to
make
use
of
the
services
of
others
in
the
present
case
he
skilfully
utilized
both
shane
and
driscoll
s
energies
and
received
their
reports
diplomatically
concealing
the
fact
that
he
was
making
tools
of
them
and
letting
them
infer
that
he
was
merely
their
also
he
depended
greatly
on
fibsy
s
assistance
the
boy
was
indefatigable
and
he
did
errands
intelligently
and
made
investigations
with
a
minute
attention
to
details
that
delighted
the
heart
of
his
master
young
mcguire
had
all
the
natural
attributes
of
a
detective
and
under
the
tuition
of
fleming
stone
was
advancing
rapidly
when
assisting
stone
on
a
case
the
two
usually
lived
together
at
some
hotel
stone
going
back
and
forth
between
there
and
his
own
home
which
was
now
in
a
westchester
suburb
it
was
part
of
the
routine
that
the
two
should
breakfast
together
and
plan
the
day
s
work
these
breakfasts
were
carefully
arranged
meals
with
correct
appointments
for
stone
had
the
boy
s
good
at
heart
and
was
glad
to
train
him
in
deportment
for
his
own
sake
but
also
he
desired
that
fibsy
should
be
presentable
in
any
society
as
the
pursuit
of
the
detective
calling
made
it
often
necessary
that
the
boy
should
visit
in
homes
fibsy
was
therefore
eating
his
breakfast
after
the
most
approved
formula
when
stone
said
well
fibs
how
about
sykes
and
barton
now
for
the
tale
of
your
call
on
willy
hanlon
i
went
down
there
stone
but
i
didn
t
see
hanlon
he
was
out
but
i
did
a
lot
better
i
saw
barton
of
sykes
and
barton
and
i
got
an
earful
it
seems
friend
willy
has
in
what
line
upward
like
the
gentleman
in
the
he
wants
to
go
higher
higher
ever
higher
aeroplane
no
not
that
way
painting
spires
not
only
spires
but
signs
in
high
places
dangerous
you
know
stone
he
told
us
that
day
at
the
embury
house
that
he
didn
t
climb
that
he
painted
signs
and
let
other
people
put
them
yes
well
what
of
it
only
this
why
did
he
try
to
deceive
us
why
barton
says
he
s
a
most
daring
climber
he
s
practicing
to
be
a
human
a
human
fly
is
that
a
new
circus
stunt
you
know
what
i
mean
you
ve
seen
a
human
fly
perform
haven
t
you
oh
that
chap
who
stood
on
his
head
on
the
coping
of
the
woolworth
building
to
get
contributions
for
the
red
cross
work
yes
i
remember
he
wasn
t
hanlon
was
he
no
sir
he
was
the
original
or
one
of
the
first
ones
there
are
lots
of
human
flies
now
they
cut
up
tricks
all
over
the
country
and
willy
hanlon
is
practicing
for
that
but
he
doesn
t
want
it
all
right
i
won
t
tell
his
guilty
secret
is
safe
with
me
now
you
re
laughing
at
me
stone
all
right
just
you
wait
and
hanlon
goes
around
on
a
too
he
does
then
we
are
undone
what
a
revelation
and
now
fibs
if
you
ll
explain
to
me
the
significance
of
hanlon
s
aspiring
ambitions
and
his
weird
taste
for
i
ll
be
fibsy
was
extremely
even
absurdly
sensitive
to
irony
sometimes
it
didn
t
affect
him
seriously
and
then
again
he
would
be
so
hurt
and
embarrassed
by
it
that
it
fairly
made
him
unable
to
talk
in
this
instance
it
overcame
him
utterly
and
his
funny
little
freckled
face
turned
red
and
his
eyes
lost
their
eagerness
and
showed
only
chagrin
come
come
said
stone
regretting
his
teasing
but
determined
to
help
the
boy
overcome
his
sensitiveness
to
it
brace
up
fibs
you
know
i
meant
no
harm
forgive
a
chap
can
t
you
and
begin
all
over
again
i
know
you
have
something
in
your
noddle
and
doubtless
something
jolly
well
worth
well
i
oh
wait
a
minute
stone
i
m
a
fool
but
i
can
t
help
it
when
you
come
at
me
like
that
i
lose
all
faith
in
my
notions
for
it
s
only
a
notion
and
a
crazy
one
at
that
and
well
sir
you
wait
till
i
ve
worked
it
up
a
little
further
and
if
there
s
anything
to
it
i
ll
expound
now
what
s
my
orders
for
fibsy
had
an
obstinate
streak
in
his
and
fleming
stone
was
too
wise
to
insist
on
the
boy
s
expounding
just
then
instead
he
said
pleasantly
fibs
i
want
you
to
make
a
round
of
the
drug
stores
it
s
not
a
hopeful
job
indeed
i
can
t
think
it
can
amount
to
anything
but
have
a
try
at
it
you
remember
hendricks
had
the
earache
i
do
indeed
he
had
it
a
month
ago
and
what
s
more
he
denied
it
at
yes
well
use
your
discretion
for
all
it
s
worth
but
get
a
line
on
the
doctor
that
prescribed
for
him
it
was
a
bad
case
you
know
and
find
out
what
he
got
to
relieve
him
and
where
he
got
yessir
say
stone
is
hendricks
implicated
do
you
think
in
the
murder
why
he
was
in
boston
at
the
time
a
man
can
t
be
in
two
places
at
once
can
he
he
can
not
he
has
a
perfect
alibi
hasn
t
he
stone
he
sure
has
fibsy
and
yet
he
was
in
the
party
that
discussed
the
possibilities
of
killing
people
by
the
henbane
yessir
but
so
was
patterson
mis
desternay
said
the
patterson
business
must
be
looked
into
i
ll
attend
to
that
i
ll
also
see
elliott
about
that
matter
of
personal
loans
that
embury
seemed
to
be
conducting
as
a
side
yes
do
please
stone
it
would
be
a
motive
if
embury
had
a
on
somebody
who
owed
him
a
whole
lot
and
couldn
t
pay
and
fine
motive
my
boy
but
how
about
opportunity
you
forget
those
bolted
and
patterson
had
borrowed
money
of
embury
how
do
you
know
that
i
heard
it
oh
well
i
got
it
from
one
of
the
footmen
of
the
apartment
house
footmen
what
do
you
mean
you
know
there
s
a
lot
of
employees
porters
rubbish
men
doormen
hallmen
pages
and
lord
knows
what
i
lump
em
all
under
the
title
of
footmen
anyway
one
of
those
persons
told
me
for
a
consideration
a
lot
about
the
private
affairs
of
the
tenants
you
know
stone
those
footmen
pick
up
a
lot
of
information
overhearing
here
and
there
and
from
the
private
servants
kept
by
the
that
s
true
fibs
there
must
be
a
mine
of
information
available
in
that
there
is
sir
and
i
caught
onto
a
good
deal
and
specially
i
learned
that
patterson
is
in
the
faction
or
whatever
you
call
it
that
didn
t
want
embury
to
be
president
of
that
and
so
you
think
patterson
had
a
hand
in
the
murder
stone
s
face
was
grave
and
there
was
no
hint
of
banter
in
his
tone
so
fibsy
replied
earnestly
well
he
is
the
man
who
has
lots
of
empty
jam
jars
go
down
in
the
garbage
but
he
has
lots
of
yes
sir
four
oh
well
i
suppose
a
good
many
people
like
raspberry
go
on
fibsy
don
t
be
discouraged
as
i
ve
often
told
you
one
scrap
of
evidence
is
worth
considering
a
second
against
the
same
man
is
important
and
a
third
is
decidedly
yessir
that
s
what
i
m
bankin
on
you
see
patterson
now
he
s
over
head
and
ears
in
debt
to
embury
he
was
against
embury
for
club
president
he
was
present
at
the
henbane
discussion
and
he
s
an
habitual
buyer
of
raspberry
some
counts
and
fleming
stone
looked
thoughtful
but
not
entirely
convincing
how
d
he
get
in
you
know
his
apartment
is
directly
beneath
the
embury
apartment
but
two
floors
might
as
well
be
ten
floors
below
how
could
he
get
in
somebody
got
in
stone
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
neither
embury
nor
miss
ames
committed
that
murder
we
must
face
nor
did
ferdinand
do
it
i
ll
go
you
all
those
all
right
sir
then
somebody
got
in
from
the
how
mr
stone
haven
t
you
ever
read
detective
stories
where
a
murder
was
committed
in
a
room
that
was
locked
and
and
yet
somebody
did
get
in
and
the
fun
of
the
story
is
guessing
how
he
got
fiction
my
boy
is
one
thing
fact
is
no
sir
they
re
one
and
the
same
thing
all
right
son
have
it
your
own
way
now
if
you
re
ready
to
get
ready
skittle
off
to
your
chain
of
drug
stores
and
run
down
a
henbane
purchase
by
any
citizen
of
this
little
old
town
or
adjacent
fibsy
went
off
he
had
recovered
from
the
sense
of
annoyance
at
being
chaffed
by
stone
but
it
made
him
more
resolved
than
ever
to
prove
the
strange
theory
he
had
formed
he
didn
t
dignify
his
idea
by
the
name
of
theory
but
he
was
doggedly
sticking
to
a
notion
which
he
hoped
would
bring
forth
some
strange
developments
and
speedily
laying
aside
his
own
plans
for
the
moment
he
went
about
stone
s
business
and
had
little
difficulty
in
finding
the
nearby
druggist
whom
hendricks
frequently
patronized
alvord
hendricks
sure
he
trades
here
said
the
dapper
young
clerk
he
buys
mostly
and
but
here
s
where
he
buys
righto
and
say
a
month
or
so
ago
he
bought
some
hyoscine
oh
no
excuse
me
he
did
not
that
s
not
sold
hit
or
miss
but
maybe
you
mean
hyoscyamine
that
s
another
why
maybe
i
do
look
up
the
sale
can
t
you
and
make
why
should
i
fibsy
explained
that
in
the
interests
of
a
police
investigation
it
might
be
better
to
acquiesce
than
to
question
why
and
the
young
man
proved
obliging
so
terence
mcguire
learned
that
alvord
hendricks
bought
some
hyoscyamine
on
a
doctor
s
prescription
about
a
month
ago
the
same
to
be
used
to
relieve
a
serious
case
of
earache
but
there
was
no
record
of
his
having
bought
hyoscyarnus
which
was
the
deadly
henbane
used
in
the
medicine
was
there
any
other
record
of
hyoscyamine
against
him
satisfied
that
he
had
learned
all
he
could
fibsy
continued
his
round
of
visits
in
an
circle
but
got
no
information
on
any
henbane
sales
whatever
nothin
doin
he
told
himself
whoever
squirted
that
henbane
from
that
squirter
into
that
ear
brought
said
henbane
from
a
distance
which
to
my
mind
indicates
a
and
intelligent
reasoning
his
present
duty
done
he
started
forth
on
his
own
tour
of
investigation
he
went
to
a
small
boarding
house
in
an
inconspicuous
street
the
address
of
which
had
been
given
him
by
barton
and
asked
for
hanlon
he
ain
t
home
declared
the
frowning
landlady
who
opened
the
door
i
know
it
returned
fibsy
nonchalantly
but
i
got
ta
go
up
to
his
room
a
minute
he
sent
how
do
i
know
that
that
s
so
how
do
you
fibsy
s
grin
was
sociable
well
look
here
i
guess
this
ll
fix
it
i
m
errand
boy
to
you
know
who
he
winked
mysteriously
to
the
man
he
takes
his
acrobat
lessons
off
oh
the
woman
looked
frightened
hush
up
it
s
all
right
only
don
t
mention
no
names
go
on
upstairs
third
floor
yep
and
fibsy
went
quietly
up
the
stairs
hanlon
s
room
was
not
locked
but
a
big
wardrobe
inside
was
and
nothing
else
was
of
interest
to
the
visitor
he
picked
at
the
lock
with
his
knife
but
to
no
avail
as
he
stood
looking
wistfully
at
the
wardrobe
door
a
cheerful
voice
sounded
behind
him
i
ll
open
it
for
you
what
do
you
want
out
of
it
fibsy
looked
up
quickly
to
see
hanlon
himself
smiling
at
him
quick
to
take
a
cue
the
boy
didn
t
show
any
embarrassment
but
putting
out
his
hand
said
how
do
you
do
hanlon
fine
how
s
yourself
and
why
the
sneak
visit
my
boy
fibsy
looked
his
questioner
square
in
the
eye
and
then
said
oh
well
i
s
pose
i
may
as
well
speak
right
you
sure
may
either
tell
the
truth
or
put
up
such
a
convincing
lie
that
i
ll
think
it
s
the
truth
go
here
goes
then
fibsy
made
a
quick
decision
that
hanlon
was
too
keen
to
stand
for
any
lie
i
m
engaged
on
the
embury
murder
i
know
that
s
true
though
it
s
hard
to
fibsy
chose
to
ignore
this
dig
and
went
on
i
m
here
because
i
want
to
see
how
you
re
mixed
up
in
oh
you
do
why
not
ask
me
all
right
i
ask
you
how
are
you
connected
with
the
murder
of
sanford
embury
will
anything
i
say
be
used
against
me
hanlon
s
tone
was
jocular
but
he
was
staring
hard
at
fibsy
s
face
if
it
s
usable
was
the
nonchalant
reply
well
use
it
if
you
can
i
m
mixed
up
in
the
matter
as
you
put
it
because
i
m
trying
to
find
the
murderer
on
my
own
why
do
you
want
the
murderer
on
your
own
account
i
didn
t
agree
to
answer
more
than
one
question
but
i
will
i
don
t
want
the
murderer
particularly
but
i
m
interested
in
the
case
i
ve
the
detective
instinct
myself
and
i
thought
if
i
could
track
down
the
villain
i
might
get
a
reward
is
there
one
offered
not
that
i
know
of
but
i
daresay
either
elliott
or
hendricks
would
willingly
pay
to
have
the
murderer
why
those
two
why
not
embury
innocent
child
those
two
are
deeply
desperately
darkly
in
love
with
the
the
let
s
leave
her
out
of
this
ha
ha
a
squire
of
dames
eh
and
at
your
age
all
right
leave
the
lady
s
name
out
but
i
ve
confessed
my
hidden
purpose
now
tell
me
what
brings
you
to
my
domicile
on
false
pretenses
and
why
do
i
find
you
on
the
point
of
breaking
into
my
wardrobe
truth
does
it
i
wanted
to
see
if
i
could
find
a
false
beard
and
a
white
oh
you
did
and
what
good
would
that
do
you
you
have
cleverly
discerned
that
i
assumed
an
innocent
disguise
in
order
to
give
aid
and
comfort
to
a
most
worthy
dame
of
advanced
you
did
but
why
are
you
paul
pry
you
ll
drive
me
crazy
with
your
eternal
why
all
right
go
crazy
then
but
why
the
same
old
reason
and
hanlon
spoke
seriously
i
m
trying
as
i
said
to
find
the
embury
murderer
and
i
contrived
that
session
with
the
old
lady
in
hopes
of
learning
something
to
help
me
in
finding
and
did
you
i
learned
that
she
is
a
harmless
but
none
the
less
positively
demented
woman
i
learned
that
she
deceives
herself
in
a
way
hypnotizes
herself
and
she
believes
she
sees
and
hears
things
that
she
does
not
see
and
and
tastes
them
and
smells
them
there
too
she
deceives
herself
surely
you
don
t
take
in
that
story
of
her
vision
i
believe
she
believes
yes
so
do
i
now
look
here
mcguire
i
m
a
sort
and
i
m
willing
to
overlook
this
raid
of
yours
if
you
ll
join
forces
i
can
help
you
but
only
if
you
re
frank
and
honest
in
whacking
up
with
whatever
info
you
have
i
know
something
you
know
something
will
you
go
in
cahoots
i
would
hanlon
and
fibsy
looked
regretful
if
i
was
my
own
boss
but
you
see
i
m
under
orders
i
m
stone
s
helper
and
i
ll
tell
you
what
he
says
i
may
and
that
s
that
goes
i
don
t
want
any
more
than
your
boss
lets
you
spill
and
now
honest
what
did
you
come
here
for
to
look
in
that

and
returned

looking

an
amused
expression
on
his
face
any
incriminating
evidence

said

fibsy
hung
up
the
final

re

the

in

himself

went
on

way
oh

what
a
feller
chapter
xviii
the
guilty
one
alvord
you
shock
me
you
amaze
me
how
dare
you
talk
to
me
of
love
when
my
husband
hasn
t
been
dead
a
fortnight
what
matter
eunice
you
never
really
loved
sanford
i
did
i
did
not
lately
anyhow
perhaps
just
at
first
and
then
not
deeply
he
carried
you
originally
by
storm
it
was
an
even
whether
he
or
elliott
or
i
won
out
he
was
the
most
forceful
of
the
three
and
he
made
you
marry
him
didn
t
he
now
don
t
talk
nonsense
i
married
sanford
of
my
own
free
will
yes
and
in
haste
and
repented
at
leisure
now
don
t
be
hypocritical
and
pretend
to
grieve
for
him
his
death
was
shocking
fearful
but
you
re
really
relieved
that
he
is
gone
why
not
admit
it
alvord
stop
such
talk
i
command
you
i
won
t
listen
very
well
dearest
i
ll
stop
it
i
beg
your
pardon
i
forgot
myself
i
confess
now
let
me
atone
i
love
you
eunice
and
i
ll
promise
not
to
tell
you
so
or
to
talk
about
it
now
if
you
ll
just
give
me
a
ray
of
hope
a
glimmer
of
anticipation
will
you
sometime
darling
let
me
tell
you
of
my
love
after
such
an
interval
as
you
judge
proper
will
you
eunice
no
i
will
not
i
don
t
love
you
i
never
did
and
never
can
love
you
how
did
you
ever
get
such
an
idea
into
your
head
the
beautiful
face
expressed
surprise
and
incredulity
rather
than
anger
and
eunice
s
voice
was
gentle
in
such
a
mood
she
was
even
more
attractive
than
in
her
more
vivacious
moments
unable
to
control
himself
hendricks
took
a
step
toward
her
and
folded
her
in
his
arms
she
made
no
effort
to
disengage
herself
but
said
in
a
tone
of
utter
disdain
let
me
go
alvord
you
bore
as
she
had
well
known
this
angered
him
far
more
than
angry
words
would
have
done
he
released
her
instantly
but
his
face
was
blazing
with
indignation
oh
i
do
do
i
and
who
can
make
love
to
you
and
not
bore
you
elliott
you
are
still
forgetting
i
am
not
i
am
thinking
of
myself
only
oh
eunice
dear
eunice
i
have
loved
you
so
long
and
i
have
been
good
all
the
time
you
were
sanford
s
wife
i
never
so
much
as
called
you
dear
never
gave
you
even
a
look
that
wasn
t
one
of
respect
for
my
friend
s
wife
but
now
now
that
you
are
free
i
have
a
right
to
woo
you
it
is
too
soon
yes
i
know
that
but
i
will
wait
wait
as
long
as
you
command
if
you
ll
only
promise
me
that
i
may
sometime
never
i
told
you
that
before
i
do
not
want
to
be
obliged
to
repeat
it
please
understand
once
for
all
i
have
no
love
to
give
you
because
it
is
another
s
eunice
tell
me
you
do
not
care
for
elliott
and
i
won
t
say
another
word
now
i
ll
wait
patiently
for
a
year
two
years
as
long
as
you
wish
only
give
me
the
assurance
that
you
will
not
marry
mason
you
are
impossible
how
dare
you
speak
to
me
of
my
marriage
with
anybody
when
my
husband
is
only
just
dead
one
word
more
alvord
on
the
subject
and
i
shall
forbid
you
my
house
all
right
my
lady
put
on
your
high
and
mighty
air
if
you
choose
but
before
you
marry
that
man
make
sure
that
he
did
not
himself
prepare
the
way
for
the
wedding
what
do
you
mean
are
you
accusing
mason
of
i
make
no
accusations
but
who
did
kill
sanford
i
know
you
didn
t
do
it
and
elliott
has
engaged
stone
to
prove
that
you
didn
t
it
is
absurd
we
all
know
to
suspect
aunt
abby
i
was
out
of
town
who
is
left
but
mason
hush
i
won
t
listen
to
such
a
suggestion
mason
was
at
his
home
that
are
you
sure
of
course
i
m
sure
and
i
don
t
have
to
have
it
proved
by
a
detective
either
and
now
alvord
hendricks
you
may
go
i
don
t
care
to
talk
to
anyone
who
can
make
such
a
contemptible
accusation
against
a
lifelong
friend
but
before
hendricks
left
elliott
himself
came
in
he
was
grave
and
preoccupied
he
bowed
a
little
curtly
to
hendricks
and
as
he
took
eunice
s
hand
he
said
may
i
see
you
alone
i
want
to
talk
over
some
business
matters
and
i
m
pressed
for
oh
all
right
hendricks
said
i
can
take
a
hint
i
m
going
how
s
your
sleuth
progressing
elliott
has
stone
unearthed
the
murderer
yet
not
yet
but
soon
and
elliott
essayed
to
pass
the
subject
off
lightly
very
soon
hendricks
looked
at
him
in
a
curious
manner
very
soon
i
that
s
interesting
would
it
be
indiscreet
to
ask
in
what
direction
one
must
look
for
the
criminal
it
would
elliott
smiled
a
little
now
run
along
hendricks
that
s
a
good
chap
i
ve
important
business
matters
to
talk
over
with
hendricks
went
and
elliott
turned
to
eunice
with
a
grave
face
i
ve
been
going
over
sanford
s
private
papers
he
said
and
eunice
there
s
a
lot
that
we
want
to
keep
was
sanford
a
bad
man
she
asked
her
quiet
white
face
imploring
a
negative
answer
not
so
very
but
as
you
know
he
had
a
love
of
money
a
sort
of
acquisitiveness
that
led
him
into
questionable
dealings
he
loaned
money
to
any
one
who
would
give
him
security
that
isn
t
wrong
not
in
itself
but
oh
eunice
i
can
t
explain
it
to
you
or
at
least
i
don
t
want
to
but
sanford
lent
money
to
men
to
his
friends
who
were
in
great
exigency
who
gave
their
choicest
belongings
their
treasures
as
security
and
then
he
had
no
leniency
no
compassion
for
them
why
should
he
have
because
well
there
is
a
justice
that
is
almost
criminal
sanford
was
a
a
shylock
there
can
you
understand
now
who
were
his
debtors
alvord
yes
hendricks
was
one
who
owed
him
enormous
sums
and
he
was
going
to
make
lots
of
trouble
i
mean
sanford
was
why
eunice
in
sanford
s
private
safe
are
practically
all
of
hendricks
stocks
and
bonds
put
up
as
collateral
sanford
holds
mortgages
on
all
hendricks
belongings
real
estate
furniture
everything
now
just
at
the
time
sanford
died
these
notes
were
due
this
indebtedness
of
hendricks
to
sanford
had
to
be
paid
and
merely
the
fact
of
san
s
death
occurring
just
when
it
did
saved
alvord
from
financial
do
you
mean
sanford
would
have
insisted
on
the
payment
then
oh
mason
i
can
t
say
it
i
wouldn
t
breathe
it
to
any
one
but
you
but
could
alvord
have
killed
sanford
of
course
not
eunice
he
was
in
boston
you
yes
i
know
but
mason
he
hinted
to
me
just
now
that
that
maybe
you
killed
did
he
dear
then
he
was
angry
or
or
crazy
he
doesn
t
think
so
perhaps
he
was
very
yes
he
was
how
did
you
know
i
have
eyes
you
don
t
care
for
him
particularly
do
you
eunice
their
eyes
met
and
in
one
long
look
the
truth
was
told
a
great
love
existed
between
these
two
and
both
had
been
honest
and
honorable
so
long
as
eunice
was
sanford
s
wife
and
even
now
though
embury
was
gone
elliott
made
no
protestation
of
love
to
his
widow
said
no
word
that
might
not
have
been
heard
by
the
whole
world
but
they
both
knew
no
word
was
necessary
a
beautiful
expression
came
over
eunice
s
face
she
smiled
a
little
and
the
in
her
eyes
was
unmistakable
i
shall
never
lose
my
temper
again
she
said
softly
and
mason
elliott
believed
her
another
big
debtor
to
sanford
is
patterson
he
went
on
forcing
himself
to
calm
his
riotous
pulses
and
continue
his
business
talk
how
is
that
man
mixed
into
our
affars
he
s
very
much
mixed
up
in
san
s
affairs
but
eunice
i
don
t
want
to
burden
you
with
all
these
details
only
you
see
alvord
is
your
lawyer
and
it
s
confoundedly
awkward
look
here
mason
do
this
can
t
you
forgive
alvord
all
sanford
s
claims
on
him
i
mean
wipe
the
slate
clean
as
far
as
he
is
concerned
i
don
t
want
his
money
i
mean
i
don
t
want
to
keep
his
stocks
and
things
give
them
all
back
to
him
and
hush
the
matter
up
you
know
we
four
sanford
and
alvord
and
you
and
i
are
the
old
quartet
the
three
boys
and
a
girl
who
used
to
play
together
now
one
of
us
is
gone
don
t
let
s
make
any
trouble
for
another
of
the
group
i
ve
enough
money
without
realizing
on
alvord
s
securities
give
them
all
back
to
him
and
forget
it
can
t
we
why
yes
i
suppose
so
if
you
so
decree
what
about
patterson
oh
those
things
you
and
alvord
must
look
after
i
ve
no
head
for
business
and
anyway
must
it
be
attended
to
at
once
not
immediately
sanford
s
estate
is
so
large
and
his
debtors
so
numerous
it
will
take
months
to
get
it
very
well
let
anything
unpleasant
wait
for
a
while
now
on
this
very
day
and
at
this
very
hour
fibsy
was
in
philadelphia
watching
the
initial
performance
of
a
new
human
a
crowd
was
gathered
about
the
tall
skyscraper
where
the
event
was
to
take
place
and
when
hanlon
appeared
he
was
greeted
by
a
roar
of
cheering
that
warmed
his
heart
bowing
and
smiling
at
his
audience
he
started
on
his
perilous
climb
up
the
side
of
the
building
the
sight
was
thrilling
breathlessly
the
people
watched
as
he
climbed
up
the
straight
sheer
facade
catching
now
at
a
window
ledge
now
at
a
bit
of
stone
ornamentation
and
again
seeming
to
hold
on
by
nothing
at
all
almost
as
a
real
fly
does
when
he
negotiated
a
particularly
difficult
place
the
crowd
forebore
to
cheer
instinctively
feeling
it
might
disturb
him
he
went
on
higher
and
higher
now
pausing
to
look
down
and
smile
at
the
sea
of
upturned
faces
below
and
in
a
moment
of
bravado
even
daring
to
pause
and
hanging
on
by
one
hand
and
one
foot
scissor
out
his
other
limbs
and
wave
a
tiny
flag
which
he
carried
on
he
went
and
on
at
last
reaching
the
very
top
over
the
coping
he
climbed
and
gaily
waved
his
flag
as
he
bowed
to
the
applauding
crowds
below
then
for
hanlon
was
a
daring
soul
the
return
journey
was
begun
even
more
fascinating
than
the
ascent
was
this
hazardous
task
fibsy
watched
him
noted
every
step
every
motion
and
was
fairly
beside
himself
with
the
excitement
of
the
moment
and
then
when
half
a
dozen
stories
from
the
ground
when
success
was
almost
within
his
grasp
something
happened
nobody
knew
what
a
misstep
a
miscalculation
of
distance
a
slipping
stone
whatever
the
cause
hanlon
fell
fell
from
the
sixth
story
to
the
ground
those
nearest
the
catastrophe
stepped
back
others
pushed
forward
and
an
ambulance
ready
for
such
a
possible
occasion
hurried
the
wounded
man
to
the
hospital
for
hanlon
was
not
killed
but
so
crushed
and
broken
that
his
life
was
but
a
matter
of
hours
perhaps
moments
let
me
in
i
must
see
him
fibsy
fought
the
doormen
the
attendants
the
nurses
i
tell
you
i
must
in
the
name
of
the
law
let
me
in
and
then
a
more
coherent
insistence
brought
him
permission
and
he
was
immediately
admitted
to
hanlon
s
presence
a
priest
was
there
administering
extreme
unction
and
saying
such
words
of
comfort
as
he
could
command
but
at
sight
of
fibsy
hanlon
s
dull
eyes
brightened
and
he
partially
revived
yes
him
he
cried
out
with
a
sudden
flicker
of
energy
i
must
talk
to
him
the
doctor
fell
back
and
made
way
for
the
boy
let
him
talk
if
he
likes
he
said
nothing
matters
now
poor
chap
he
can
t
live
ten
awed
but
very
determined
fibsy
approached
the
bedside
he
looked
at
hanlon
strangely
still
and
white
yet
his
eyes
burning
with
a
desperate
desire
to
communicate
something
come
here
he
whispered
and
fibsy
drew
nearer
to
him
you
know
he
said
yes
and
fibsy
glanced
around
as
if
to
be
sure
of
his
witnesses
to
this
strange
confession
you
killed
sanford
i
did
i
i
oh
i
can
t
talk
you
talk
this
is
his
confession
fibsy
turned
to
the
priest
and
the
doctor
listen
to
then
addressing
himself
again
to
hanlon
he
resumed
you
climbed
up
the
side
of
the
apartment
house
on
the
cross
street
not
on
park
avenue
and
you
got
in
at
miss
ames
yes
said
hanlon
his
white
lips
barely
moving
but
his
eyes
showing
acquiescence
you
went
straight
through
those
two
rooms
softly
not
awakening
either
of
the
ladies
and
you
killed
embury
and
then
you
returned
through
the
bedrooms
again
the
eyes
said
yes
and
passing
through
miss
ames
room
she
stirred
and
thinking
she
might
be
awake
you
stopped
and
leaned
over
her
to
see
there
you
accidentally
let
fall
perhaps
from
your
breast
pocket
the
little
glass
dropper
you
had
used
and
as
you
bent
over
the
old
lady
she
grabbed
at
you
and
felt
your
jersey
sleeve
even
bit
at
it
and
tasted
raspberry
jam
that
jam
got
on
that
sleeve
as
you
climbed
up
past
the
patterson
s
window
where
a
jar
of
it
was
on
the
yes
that
s
right
hanlon
breathed
and
on
his
face
was
a
distinct
look
of
admiration
for
the
boy
s
perception
you
wore
a
the
same
one
you
re
wearing
now
and
the
odor
of
gasoline
about
you
was
from
your
you
then
were
the
vision
miss
ames
has
so
often
described
and
you
glided
silently
away
from
her
bedside
and
out
at
the
window
by
which
you
entered
gee
it
was
some
stunt
this
tribute
of
praise
was
wrung
from
fibsy
by
the
sudden
realization
that
what
he
had
for
some
time
surmised
was
really
true
i
guess
it
was
that
jam
that
did
for
you
he
went
on
but
say
we
ain
t
got
no
time
for
talkin
hanlon
s
eyes
were
already
glazing
his
breath
came
shorter
and
it
was
plain
to
be
seen
the
end
was
very
near
who
hired
you
fibsy
flung
the
question
at
him
with
such
force
that
it
seemed
to
rouse
a
last
effort
of
the
ebbing
life
in
the
dying
man
and
he
answered
faintly
but
clearly
alvord
hendricks
ten
thousand
dollars
and
then
hanlon
was
gone
reminding
the
priest
and
the
doctor
that
they
were
witnesses
to
this
dying
confession
fibsy
rushed
from
the
room
and
back
to
new
york
as
fast
as
he
could
get
there
he
learned
by
telephone
that
fleming
stone
was
at
embury
s
and
pausing
only
to
telephone
for
shane
to
go
at
once
to
the
same
house
fibsy
jumped
into
a
taxicab
and
hurried
up
there
himself
it
s
all
over
he
burst
forth
as
he
dashed
into
the
room
where
stone
sat
talking
to
eunice
mason
elliott
was
there
too
indeed
he
was
a
frequent
visitor
and
aunt
abby
sat
by
with
her
knitting
what
is
asked
stone
looking
at
the
boy
in
concern
for
fibsy
was
greatly
excited
his
fingers
worked
nervously
and
his
voice
shook
the
whole
thing
stone
hanlon
s
dead
and
he
killed
yes
i
know
fleming
stone
showed
no
surprise
did
he
fall
yessir
got
up
the
climb
all
right
and
most
down
again
and
fell
from
the
sixth
floor
killed
him
but
not
instantly
i
went
to
the
hospital
and
he
who
did
said
shane
coming
in
at
the
door
as
the
last
words
were
spoken
willy
hanlon
a
human
and
then
fleming
stone
told
the
whole
story
fibsy
adding
here
and
there
his
bits
of
information
but
i
don
t
understand
said
shane
at
last
why
would
that
chap
kill
embury
hired
said
fibsy
as
stone
hesitated
to
speak
hired
by
a
man
who
paid
him
ten
thousand
hanlon
a
gunman
said
shane
amazed
not
a
professional
one
fibsy
said
but
he
acted
as
one
in
this
case
the
man
who
hired
him
knew
he
was
privately
learning
to
be
a
human
fly
and
he
had
the
diabolical
thought
of
hiring
him
to
climb
up
this
house
and
get
in
at
the
only
available
window
and
kill
embury
with
that
henbane
and
the
man
s
name
shouted
shane
the
name
of
the
real
criminal
fibsy
sat
silent
looking
at
stone
his
name
is
alvord
hendricks
was
stone
s
quiet
reply
an
instant
commotion
arose
eunice
her
great
eyes
full
of
horror
ran
to
aunt
abby
who
seemed
about
to
collapse
from
sheer
dismay
mason
elliott
started
up
with
a
sudden
where
is
he
and
shane
echoed
with
a
roar
yes
where
is
he
can
he
get
away
no
said
stone
he
can
t
i
have
him
covered
day
and
night
by
my
men
at
present
shane
he
is
i
am
quite
sure
in
his
office
if
you
want
to
go
there
if
i
want
to
go
there
i
should
say
i
do
he
ll
get
his
and
in
less
than
half
an
hour
shane
had
taken
alvord
hendricks
into
custody
and
in
due
time
that
arch
criminal
received
the
retribution
of
justice
shane
gone
fibsy
went
over
the
whole
story
once
again
you
see
it
was
stone
s
keeping
at
it
what
did
it
he
connected
up
hanlon
and
the
jam
he
connected
up
hendricks
and
the
hamlet
business
we
connected
up
hanlon
and
the
gasoline
and
hanlon
and
the
jersey
and
the
and
all
fibsy
grew
excited
then
we
connected
up
hendricks
and
his
perfect
always
distrust
the
perfect
alibi
that
s
one
of
stone
s
first
maxims
well
this
hendricks
he
had
a
pluperfect
alibi
couldn
t
be
shaken
so
stone
he
says
the
more
perfect
the
alibi
the
more
we
must
distrust
it
so
he
went
for
that
alibi
and
he
found
that
hendricks
was
sure
in
boston
that
night
but
he
didn
t
have
any
real
reason
not
any
imperative
reason
for
going
it
was
a
sorta
trumped
up
trip
well
that
s
the
way
it
was
he
had
to
get
embury
out
of
the
way
just
then
or
be
shown
up
a
ruined
man
and
too
he
was
afraid
embury
d
be
president
of
the
club
and
too
he
wanted
to
fibsy
gave
one
eloquent
glance
at
eunice
and
paused
abruptly
in
his
speech
every
one
knew
every
one
realized
that
love
of
sanford
embury
s
wife
was
one
reason
at
least
for
the
fatal
deed
everybody
realized
that
alvord
hendricks
was
a
villain
through
and
through
that
he
had
killed
his
friend
though
not
by
his
own
hand
eunice
never
saw
hendricks
again
she
and
aunt
abby
went
away
for
a
year
s
stay
they
traveled
in
lovely
lands
where
the
scenery
and
climate
brought
rest
and
peace
to
eunice
s
troubled
heart
and
where
she
learned
by
honest
effort
to
control
her
quick
temper
and
then
after
two
of
the
friendly
quartet
had
become
only
a
past
memory
the
remaining
two
eunice
and
mason
elliott
found
happiness
and
joy
one
of
our
biggest
cases
stone
said
fibsy
one
day
reminiscently
it
was
indeed
fibs
and
you
did
yourself
great
old
scheme
perfect
alibi
unknown
human
fly
bolted
doors
all
the
elements
of
a
successful
crime
if
he
hadn
t
slipped
up
on
that
raspberry
jam
