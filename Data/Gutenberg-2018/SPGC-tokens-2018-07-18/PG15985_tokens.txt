deephaven
preface
this
book
is
not
wholly
new
several
of
the
chapters
having
already
been
published
in
the
atlantic
monthly
it
has
so
often
been
asked
if
deephaven
may
not
be
found
on
the
map
of
new
england
under
another
name
that
to
prevent
any
misunderstanding
i
wish
to
say
while
there
is
a
likeness
to
be
traced
few
of
the
sketches
are
drawn
from
that
town
itself
and
the
characters
will
in
almost
every
case
be
looked
for
there
in
vain
i
dedicate
this
story
of
life
and
country
people
first
to
my
father
and
mother
my
two
best
friends
and
also
to
all
my
other
friends
whose
names
i
say
to
myself
lovingly
though
i
do
not
write
them
here

miss
chauncey
last
days
in
deephaven
lancaster
i
had
been
spending
the
winter
in
boston
and
kate
lancaster
and
i
had
been
together
a
great
deal
for
we
are
the
best
of
friends
it
happened
that
the
morning
when
this
story
begins
i
had
waked
up
feeling
sorry
and
as
if
something
dreadful
were
going
to
happen
there
did
not
seem
to
be
any
good
reason
for
it
so
i
undertook
to
discourage
myself
more
by
thinking
that
it
would
soon
be
time
to
leave
town
and
how
much
i
should
miss
being
with
kate
and
my
other
friends
my
mind
was
still
disquieted
when
i
went
down
to
breakfast
but
beside
my
plate
i
found
with
a
letter
from
my
father
a
note
from
kate
to
this
day
i
have
never
known
any
explanation
of
that
depression
of
my
spirits
and
i
hope
that
the
good
luck
which
followed
will
help
some
reader
to
lose
fear
and
to
smile
at
such
shadows
if
any
chance
to
come
kate
had
evidently
written
to
me
in
an
excited
state
of
mind
for
her
note
was
not
so
as
usual
but
this
is
what
she
said
dear
helen
i
have
a
plan
i
think
it
a
most
delightful
plan
in
which
you
and
i
are
chief
characters
promise
that
you
will
say
yes
if
you
do
not
you
will
have
to
remember
all
your
life
that
you
broke
a
girl
heart
come
round
early
and
lunch
with
me
and
dine
with
me
i
to
be
all
alone
and
it
a
long
story
and
will
need
a
great
deal
of
talking
over
i
showed
this
note
to
my
aunt
and
soon
went
round
very
much
interested
my
opened
the
lancasters
door
and
i
hurried
to
the
parlor
where
i
heard
my
friend
practising
with
great
diligence
i
went
up
to
her
and
she
turned
her
head
and
kissed
me
solemnly
you
need
not
smile
we
are
not
sentimental
girls
and
are
both
much
averse
to
indiscriminate
kissing
though
i
have
not
the
adroit
habit
of
shying
in
which
kate
is
proficient
it
would
sometimes
be
impolite
in
any
one
else
but
she
shies
so
affectionately
wo
you
sit
down
dear
she
said
with
great
ceremony
and
went
on
with
her
playing
which
was
abominable
that
morning
her
fingers
stepped
on
each
other
and
whatever
the
tune
might
have
been
in
reality
it
certainly
had
a
most
remarkable
incoherence
as
i
heard
it
then
i
took
up
the
new
littell
and
made
believe
read
it
and
finally
threw
it
at
kate
you
would
have
thought
we
were
two
children
have
you
heard
that
my
miss
katharine
brandon
of
deephaven
is
dead
i
knew
that
she
had
died
in
november
at
least
six
months
before
do
be
nonsensical
kate
said
i
what
is
it
you
are
going
to
tell
me
my
died
very
old
and
was
the
last
of
her
generation
she
had
a
sister
and
three
brothers
one
of
whom
had
the
honor
of
being
my
grandfather
mamma
is
sole
heir
to
the
family
estates
in
deephaven
and
all
and
it
is
a
great
inconvenience
to
her
the
house
is
a
charming
old
house
and
some
of
my
ancestors
who
followed
the
sea
brought
home
the
greater
part
of
its
furnishings
miss
katharine
was
a
person
who
ignored
all
frivolities
and
her
house
was
as
sedate
as
herself
i
have
been
there
but
little
for
when
i
was
a
child
my
aunt
found
no
pleasure
in
the
society
of
noisy
children
who
upset
her
treasures
and
when
i
was
older
she
did
not
care
to
see
strangers
and
after
i
left
school
she
grew
more
and
more
feeble
i
had
not
been
there
for
two
years
when
she
died
mamma
went
down
very
often
the
town
is
a
quaint
old
place
which
has
seen
better
days
there
are
high
rocks
at
the
shore
and
there
is
a
beach
and
there
are
woods
inland
and
hills
and
there
is
the
sea
it
might
be
dull
in
deephaven
for
two
young
ladies
who
were
fond
of
gay
society
and
dependent
upon
excitement
i
suppose
but
for
two
little
girls
who
were
fond
of
each
other
and
could
play
in
the
boats
and
dig
and
build
houses
in
the
and
gather
shells
and
carry
their
dolls
wherever
they
went
what
could
be
pleasanter
nothing
said
i
promptly
kate
had
told
this
a
little
at
a
time
with
a
few
appropriate
bars
of
music
between
which
suddenly
reminded
me
of
the
story
of
a
chinese
procession
which
i
had
read
in
one
of
marryat
novels
when
i
was
a
child
a
thousand
white
elephants
richly
caparisoned
and
so
on
for
a
page
or
two
she
seemed
to
have
finished
her
story
for
that
time
and
while
it
was
dawning
upon
me
what
she
meant
she
sang
a
bit
from
one
of
jean
ingelow
verses
will
ye
step
aboard
my
dearest
for
the
high
seas
lie
before
us
and
then
came
over
to
sit
beside
me
and
tell
the
whole
story
in
a
more
sensible
fashion
you
know
that
my
father
has
been
meaning
to
go
to
england
in
the
autumn
yesterday
he
told
us
that
he
is
to
leave
in
a
month
and
will
be
away
all
summer
and
mamma
is
going
with
him
jack
and
willy
are
to
join
a
party
of
their
classmates
who
are
to
spend
nearly
the
whole
of
the
long
vacation
at
lake
superior
i
do
care
to
go
abroad
again
now
and
i
did
not
like
any
plan
that
was
proposed
to
me
aunt
anna
was
here
all
the
afternoon
and
she
is
going
to
take
the
house
at
newport
which
is
very
pleasant
and
unexpected
for
she
hates
housekeeping
mamma
thought
of
course
that
i
would
go
with
her
but
i
did
not
wish
to
do
that
and
it
would
only
result
in
my
keeping
house
for
her
visitors
whom
i
know
very
little
and
she
will
be
much
more
free
and
independent
by
herself
beside
she
can
have
my
room
if
i
am
not
there
i
have
promised
to
make
her
a
long
visit
in
baltimore
next
winter
instead
i
told
mamma
that
i
should
like
to
stay
here
and
go
away
when
i
choose
there
are
ever
so
many
visits
which
i
have
promised
i
could
stay
with
you
and
your
aunt
mary
at
lenox
if
she
goes
there
for
a
while
and
i
have
always
wished
to
spend
a
summer
in
town
but
mamma
did
not
encourage
that
at
all
in
the
evening
papa
gave
her
a
letter
which
had
come
from
dockum
the
man
who
takes
care
of
aunt
katharine
place
and
the
most
charming
idea
came
into
my
head
and
i
said
i
meant
to
spend
my
summer
in
deephaven
at
first
they
laughed
at
me
and
then
they
said
i
might
go
if
i
chose
and
at
last
they
thought
nothing
could
be
pleasanter
and
mamma
wishes
she
were
going
herself
i
asked
if
she
did
not
think
you
would
be
the
best
person
to
keep
me
company
and
she
does
and
papa
announced
that
he
was
just
going
to
suggest
my
asking
you
i
am
to
take
ann
and
maggie
who
will
be
overjoyed
for
they
came
from
that
part
of
the
country
and
the
other
servants
are
to
go
with
aunt
anna
and
old
nora
will
come
to
take
care
of
this
house
as
she
always
does
perhaps
you
and
i
will
come
up
to
town
once
in
a
while
for
a
few
days
we
shall
have
such
jolly
housekeeping
mamma
and
i
sat
up
very
late
last
night
and
everything
is
planned
dockum
house
is
very
near
aunt
katharine
so
we
shall
not
be
lonely
though
i
know
you
no
more
afraid
of
that
than
o
helen
wo
you
go
do
you
think
it
took
me
long
to
decide
and
lancaster
sailed
the
of
june
and
my
aunt
mary
went
to
spend
her
summer
among
the
berkshire
hills
so
i
was
at
the
ready
to
welcome
kate
when
she
came
home
after
having
said
good
by
to
her
father
and
mother
we
meant
to
go
to
deephaven
in
a
week
but
were
obliged
to
stay
in
town
longer
boston
was
nearly
deserted
of
our
friends
at
the
last
and
we
used
to
take
quiet
walks
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
after
dinner
up
and
down
the
street
or
sit
on
the
front
steps
in
company
with
the
servants
left
in
charge
of
the
other
houses
who
also
sometimes
walked
up
and
down
and
looked
at
us
wonderingly
we
had
much
shopping
to
do
in
the
daytime
for
there
was
a
probability
of
our
spending
many
days
in
doors
and
as
we
were
not
to
be
near
any
large
town
and
did
not
mean
to
come
to
boston
for
weeks
at
least
there
was
a
great
deal
to
be
remembered
and
arranged
we
enjoyed
making
our
plans
and
deciding
what
we
should
want
and
going
to
the
shops
together
i
think
we
felt
most
important
the
day
we
conferred
with
ann
and
made
out
a
list
of
the
provisions
which
must
be
ordered
this
was
being
housekeepers
in
earnest
dockum
happened
to
come
to
town
and
we
sent
ann
and
maggie
with
most
of
our
boxes
to
deephaven
in
his
company
a
day
or
two
before
we
were
ready
to
go
ourselves
and
when
we
reached
there
the
house
was
opened
and
in
order
for
us
on
our
journey
to
deephaven
we
left
the
railway
twelve
miles
from
that
place
and
took
passage
in
a
there
was
only
one
passenger
beside
ourselves
she
was
a
very
large
thin
woman
and
looked
so
tired
and
lonesome
and
that
i
could
not
help
saying
it
was
very
dusty
and
she
was
apparently
delighted
to
answer
that
she
should
think
everybody
was
sweeping
and
she
always
felt
after
being
in
the
cars
a
while
as
if
she
had
been
taken
all
to
pieces
and
left
in
the
different
places
and
this
was
the
beginning
of
our
friendship
with
kew
after
this
conversation
we
looked
industriously
out
of
the
window
into
the
pastures
and
i
had
given
up
my
seat
to
her
for
i
do
not
mind
riding
backward
in
the
least
and
you
would
have
thought
i
had
done
her
the
greatest
favor
of
her
life
i
think
she
was
the
most
grateful
of
women
and
i
was
often
reminded
of
a
remark
one
of
my
friends
once
made
about
some
one
if
you
give
bessie
a
of
she
behaves
to
you
as
if
it
were
the
most
exquisite
of
presents
kate
and
i
had
some
fruit
left
in
our
and
divided
it
with
kew
but
after
the
first
mouthful
we
looked
at
each
other
in
dismay
lemons
with
oranges
clothes
on
are
they
said
she
as
kate
threw
hers
out
of
the
window
and
mine
went
after
it
for
company
and
after
this
we
began
to
be
very
friendly
indeed
we
both
liked
the
odd
woman
there
was
something
so
straightforward
and
kindly
about
her
are
you
going
to
deephaven
dear
she
asked
me
and
then
i
wonder
if
you
are
going
to
stay
long
all
summer
well
that
clever
i
do
hope
you
will
come
out
to
the
light
to
see
me
young
folks
always
like
my
place
most
likely
your
friends
will
fetch
you
do
you
know
the
brandon
house
asked
kate
well
as
i
do
the
there
i
wonder
i
did
know
from
the
beginning
but
i
have
been
a
trying
all
the
way
to
settle
it
who
you
could
be
i
been
up
country
some
weeks
stopping
with
my
mother
and
she
seemed
so
set
to
have
me
stay
till
and
would
hardly
let
me
come
now
you
see
she
getting
to
be
old
why
every
time
come
away
for
fifteen
years
she
said
it
was
the
last
time
i
ever
see
her
but
she
a
dreadful
smart
woman
of
her
age
wrote
me
some
lancaster
folks
were
going
to
take
the
brandon
house
this
summer
and
so
you
are
the
ones
it
a
sightly
old
place
i
used
to
go
and
see
miss
katharine
she
must
have
left
a
power
of
she
set
a
great
deal
by
the
house
and
she
kept
everything
just
as
it
used
to
be
in
her
mother
day
then
you
live
in
deephaven
too
asked
kate
i
been
here
the
better
part
of
my
life
i
was
raised
up
among
the
hills
in
vermont
and
i
shall
always
be
a
real
woman
if
i
live
here
a
hundred
years
the
sea
does
come
natural
to
me
it
kind
of
worries
me
though
you
wo
find
a
happier
woman
than
i
be
shore
when
i
was
first
married
had
a
schooner
and
went
to
the
banks
and
once
he
was
off
on
a
whaling
voyage
and
i
hope
i
may
never
come
to
so
long
a
three
years
as
those
were
again
though
i
was
up
to
mother
before
i
was
married
he
had
been
everywhere
when
he
came
home
that
time
from
whaling
he
found
i
taken
it
so
to
heart
that
he
said
he
never
go
off
again
and
then
he
got
the
chance
to
keep
deephaven
light
and
we
lived
there
seventeen
years
come
january
there
is
great
pay
but
then
nobody
tries
to
get
it
away
from
us
and
we
got
so
to
be
contented
if
it
is
lonesome
in
winter
do
you
really
live
in
the
lighthouse
i
remember
how
i
used
to
beg
to
be
taken
out
there
when
i
was
a
child
and
how
i
used
to
watch
for
the
light
at
night
said
kate
enthusiastically
so
began
a
friendship
which
we
both
still
treasure
for
knowing
kew
was
one
of
the
pleasantest
things
which
happened
to
us
in
that
delightful
summer
and
she
used
to
do
so
much
for
our
pleasure
and
was
so
good
to
us
when
we
went
out
to
the
lighthouse
for
the
last
time
to
say
good
by
we
were
very
sorry
girls
indeed
we
had
no
idea
until
then
how
much
she
cared
for
us
and
her
affection
touched
us
very
much
she
told
us
that
she
loved
us
as
if
we
belonged
to
her
and
begged
us
not
to
forget
her
as
if
we
ever
could
and
to
remember
that
there
was
always
a
home
and
a
warm
heart
for
us
if
she
were
alive
kate
and
i
have
often
agreed
that
few
of
our
acquaintances
are
half
so
entertaining
her
comparisons
were
most
striking
and
amusing
and
her
comments
upon
the
books
she
read
for
she
was
a
great
reader
were
very
shrewd
and
clever
and
always
to
the
point
she
was
never
out
of
temper
even
when
the
barrels
of
oil
were
being
rolled
across
her
kitchen
floor
and
she
was
such
a
wise
woman
this
which
we
expected
to
find
tiresome
we
enjoyed
very
much
and
we
were
glad
to
think
when
the
coach
stopped
and
he
came
to
meet
her
with
great
satisfaction
that
we
had
one
friend
in
deephaven
at
all
events
i
liked
the
house
from
my
very
first
sight
of
it
it
stood
behind
a
row
of
poplars
which
were
as
green
and
flourishing
as
the
poplars
which
stand
in
stately
processions
in
the
fields
around
quebec
it
was
an
imposing
great
white
house
and
the
lilacs
were
tall
and
there
were
crowds
of
not
yet
out
of
bloom
and
there
were
box
borders
and
there
were
great
elms
at
the
side
of
the
house
and
down
the
road
the
hall
door
stood
wide
open
and
my
hostess
turned
to
me
as
we
went
in
with
one
of
her
sweet
sudden
smiles
wo
we
have
a
good
time
nelly
said
she
and
i
thought
we
should
so
our
summer
housekeeping
began
in
most
pleasant
fashion
it
was
just
at
sunset
and
ann
and
maggie
presence
made
the
house
seem
familiar
at
once
maggie
had
been
unpacking
for
us
and
there
was
a
delicious
supper
ready
for
the
hungry
girls
later
in
the
evening
we
went
down
to
the
shore
which
was
not
very
far
away
the
fresh
was
welcome
after
the
dusty
day
and
it
seemed
so
quiet
and
pleasant
in
deephaven
brandon
house
and
the
i
do
not
know
that
the
brandon
house
is
really
very
remarkable
but
i
never
have
been
in
one
that
interested
me
in
the
same
way
kate
used
to
recount
to
select
audiences
at
school
some
of
her
experiences
with
her
aunt
katharine
and
it
was
popularly
believed
that
she
once
carried
down
some
indestructible
when
they
were
first
in
fashion
and
the
old
lady
basted
them
for
her
to
hem
round
the
edges
at
the
rate
of
two
a
day
it
may
have
been
fabulous
it
was
impossible
to
imagine
any
children
in
the
old
place
everything
was
for
grown
people
even
the
was
too
high
to
slide
down
on
the
chairs
looked
as
if
they
had
been
put
at
the
furnishing
of
the
house
in
their
places
and
there
they
meant
to
remain
the
carpets
were
particularly
interesting
and
i
remember
kate
pointing
out
to
me
one
day
a
great
square
figure
in
one
and
telling
me
she
used
to
keep
house
there
with
her
dolls
for
lack
of
a
better
and
if
one
of
them
chanced
to
fall
outside
the
boundary
stripe
it
was
immediately
put
to
bed
with
a
cold
it
is
a
house
with
great
possibilities
it
might
easily
be
made
charming
there
are
four
very
large
rooms
on
the
lower
floor
and
six
above
a
wide
hall
in
each
story
and
a
fascinating
garret
over
the
whole
where
were
many
mysterious
old
chests
and
boxes
in
one
of
which
we
found
grandmother
and
you
may
be
sure
the
vista
of
rummages
which
lancaster
had
laughed
about
was
explored
to
its
very
end
the
rooms
all
have
elaborate
cornices
and
the
lower
hall
is
very
fine
with
an
archway
dividing
it
and
panellings
of
all
sorts
and
a
great
door
at
each
end
through
which
the
lilacs
in
front
and
the
old
pensioner
in
the
garden
are
seen
exchanging
bows
and
gestures
coming
from
the
lancasters
high
city
house
it
did
not
seem
as
if
we
had
to
go
up
stairs
at
all
there
for
every
step
of
the
stairway
is
so
broad
and
low
and
you
come
to
a
square
landing
with
an
old
chair
in
each
farther
corner
and
between
them
a
large
window
with
a
cushioned
seat
looking
out
on
the
garden
and
the
village
the
hills
far
inland
and
the
sunset
beyond
all
then
you
turn
and
go
up
a
few
more
steps
to
the
upper
hall
where
we
used
to
stay
a
great
deal
there
were
more
old
chairs
and
a
pair
of
remarkable
sofas
on
which
we
used
to
deposit
the
treasures
collected
in
our
wanderings
the
wide
window
which
looks
out
on
the
lilacs
and
the
sea
was
a
favorite
seat
of
ours
facing
each
other
on
either
side
of
it
are
two
old
secretaries
and
one
of
them
we
ascertained
to
be
the
of
secret
drawers
in
which
may
be
found
valuable
records
deposited
by
ourselves
one
rainy
day
when
we
first
explored
it
we
wrote
between
us
a
tragic
journal
on
some
yellow
old
we
found
in
the
desk
we
put
it
in
the
most
hidden
drawer
by
itself
and
flatter
ourselves
that
it
will
be
regarded
with
great
interest
some
time
or
other
of
one
of
the
front
rooms
the
best
chamber
we
stood
rather
in
dread
it
is
very
remarkable
that
there
seem
to
be
no
connected
with
any
part
of
the
house
particularly
this
we
are
neither
of
us
nervous
but
there
is
certainly
something
dismal
about
the
room
the
huge
curtained
bed
and
immense
windows
and
everything
were
draped
in
some
kind
of
white
cloth
which
always
seemed
to
be
waving
and
moving
about
of
itself
the
carpet
was
most
singularly
colored
with
dark
reds
and
indescribable
grays
and
browns
and
the
pattern
after
a
whole
summer
study
could
never
be
followed
with
one
eye
the
paper
was
captured
in
a
french
prize
somewhere
some
time
in
the
last
century
and
part
of
the
figure
was
shaggy
and
therein
little
spiders
found
habitation
and
went
visiting
their
acquaintances
across
the
shiny
places
the
color
was
an
unearthly
pink
and
a
forbidding
maroon
with
dim
white
spots
which
gave
it
the
appearance
of
having
moulded
it
made
you
to
look
long
in
the
mirror
and
the
great
lounge
one
could
not
have
cheerful
associations
with
after
hearing
that
miss
brandon
herself
did
not
like
it
having
seen
so
many
of
her
relatives
lie
there
dead
there
were
fantastic
china
ornaments
from
bible
subjects
on
the
mantel
and
the
only
picture
was
one
of
the
maid
of
orleans
tied
with
an
unnecessarily
strong
rope
to
a
very
stout
stake
the
best
parlor
we
also
rarely
used
because
all
the
portraits
which
hung
there
had
for
some
unaccountable
reason
taken
a
violent
dislike
to
us
and
followed
us
suspiciously
with
their
eyes
the
furniture
was
stately
and
very
uncomfortable
and
there
was
something
about
the
room
which
suggested
an
invisible
funeral
there
is
not
very
much
to
say
about
the
it
was
not
specially
interesting
though
the
sea
was
in
sight
from
one
of
the
windows
there
were
some
old
dutch
pictures
on
the
wall
so
dark
that
one
could
scarcely
make
out
what
they
were
meant
to
represent
and
one
or
two
engravings
there
was
a
huge
sideboard
for
which
kate
had
brought
down
from
boston
miss
brandon
own
silver
which
had
stood
there
for
so
many
years
and
looked
so
much
more
at
home
and
in
place
than
any
other
possibly
could
have
looked
and
kate
also
found
in
the
closet
the
three
great
decanters
with
silver
labels
chained
round
their
necks
which
had
always
been
the
companions
of
the
in
her
lifetime
from
the
little
closets
in
the
sideboard
there
came
a
most
significant
odor
of
cake
and
wine
whenever
one
opened
the
doors
we
used
miss
brandon
beautiful
old
blue
india
china
which
she
had
given
to
kate
and
which
had
been
carefully
packed
all
winter
kate
sat
at
the
head
and
i
at
the
foot
of
the
round
table
and
i
must
confess
that
we
were
apt
to
have
either
a
feast
or
a
famine
for
at
first
we
often
forgot
to
provide
our
dinners
if
this
were
the
case
maggie
was
sure
to
serve
us
with
most
derisive
elegance
and
make
us
wait
for
as
much
ceremony
as
she
thought
necessary
for
one
of
the
west
parlor
was
our
favorite
room
down
stairs
it
had
a
great
fireplace
framed
in
blue
and
white
dutch
tiles
which
ingeniously
and
instructively
represented
the
careers
of
the
good
and
the
bad
man
the
of
each
being
a
very
singular
cradle
in
the
centre
at
the
top
the
last
two
of
the
series
are
very
high
art
a
great
coffin
stands
in
the
foreground
of
each
and
the
virtuous
man
is
being
led
off
by
two
angels
while
the
wicked
one
is
hastening
from
an
indescribable
but
unpleasant
assemblage
of
claws
and
horns
and
eyes
which
is
rapidly
advancing
from
the
distance
and
bringing
a
chain
with
it
there
was
a
large
cabinet
holding
all
the
small
curiosities
and
there
seemed
to
be
no
other
place
for
odd
china
figures
and
cups
and
vases
unaccountable
chinese
carvings
and
exquisite
corals
and
minerals
and
swiss
and
articles
of
from
the
south
seas
underneath
were
stored
boxes
of
letters
and
old
magazines
for
this
was
one
of
the
houses
where
nothing
seems
to
have
been
thrown
away
in
one
parting
we
found
a
parcel
of
old
manuscript
sermons
the
existence
of
which
was
a
mystery
until
kate
remembered
there
had
been
a
gifted
son
of
the
house
who
entered
the
ministry
and
soon
died
the
windows
had
each
a
pane
of
stained
glass
and
on
the
wide
sills
we
used
to
put
our
immense
bouquets
of
there
was
one
place
which
i
liked
and
sat
in
more
than
any
other
the
chimney
filled
nearly
the
whole
side
of
the
room
all
but
this
little
corner
where
there
was
just
room
for
a
very
comfortable
cushioned
chair
and
a
narrow
window
where
i
always
had
a
bunch
of
fresh
green
ferns
in
a
tall
i
used
to
write
there
often
and
always
sat
there
when
kate
sang
and
played
she
sent
for
a
tuner
and
used
to
successfully
coax
the
music
from
the
antiquated
piano
and
sing
for
her
visitors
by
the
hour
she
almost
always
sang
her
oldest
songs
for
they
seemed
most
in
keeping
with
everything
about
us
i
used
to
fancy
that
the
portraits
liked
our
being
there
there
was
one
young
girl
who
seemed
solitary
and
forlorn
among
the
rest
in
the
room
who
were
all
for
their
part
they
looked
amiable
but
rather
unhappy
as
if
she
had
come
in
and
interrupted
their
conversation
we
both
grew
very
fond
of
her
and
it
seemed
when
we
went
in
the
last
morning
on
purpose
to
take
leave
of
her
as
if
she
looked
at
us
imploringly
she
was
soon
afterward
boxed
up
and
now
enjoys
society
after
her
own
heart
in
kate
room
in
boston
there
was
the
largest
sofa
i
ever
saw
opposite
the
fireplace
it
must
have
been
brought
in
in
pieces
and
built
in
the
room
it
was
broad
enough
for
kate
and
me
to
lie
on
together
and
very
high
and
square
but
there
was
a
pile
of
soft
cushions
at
one
end
we
used
to
enjoy
it
greatly
in
september
when
the
evenings
were
long
and
cool
and
we
had
many
candles
and
a
fire
and
crickets
too
on
the
hearth
and
the
dear
dog
lying
on
the
rug
i
remember
one
rainy
night
just
before
miss
tennant
and
kitty
bruce
went
away
we
had
a
real
fire
and
blew
out
the
lights
and
told
stories
miss
margaret
knows
so
many
and
tells
them
so
well
kate
and
i
were
unusually
entertaining
for
we
became
familiar
with
the
family
record
of
the
town
and
could
recount
marvellous
adventures
by
land
and
sea
and
by
the
dozen
we
had
never
either
of
us
been
in
a
society
consisting
of
so
many
travelled
people
hardly
a
man
but
had
been
the
most
of
his
life
at
sea
speaking
of
i
must
tell
you
that
once
in
the
summer
two
cambridge
girls
who
were
spending
a
week
with
us
unwisely
enticed
us
into
giving
some
thrilling
recitals
which
nearly
frightened
them
out
of
their
wits
and
kate
and
i
were
finally
in
terror
ourselves
we
had
all
been
on
the
sofa
in
the
dark
singing
and
talking
and
were
waiting
in
great
suspense
after
i
had
finished
one
of
such
particular
horror
that
i
declared
it
should
be
the
last
when
we
heard
footsteps
on
the
hall
stairs
there
were
lights
in
the
which
shone
faintly
through
the
door
and
we
saw
something
white
and
shapeless
come
slowly
down
and
clutched
each
other
gowns
in
agony
it
was
only
kate
dog
who
came
in
and
laid
his
head
in
her
lap
and
slept
peacefully
we
thought
we
could
not
sleep
a
wink
after
this
and
i
bravely
went
alone
out
to
the
light
to
see
my
watch
and
finding
it
was
past
twelve
we
concluded
to
sit
up
all
night
and
to
go
down
to
the
shore
at
sunrise
it
would
be
so
much
easier
than
getting
up
early
some
morning
we
had
been
out
rowing
and
had
taken
a
long
walk
the
day
before
and
were
obliged
to
dance
and
make
other
slight
exertions
to
keep
ourselves
awake
at
one
time
we
lunched
at
two
and
i
never
shall
forget
the
sunrise
that
morning
but
we
were
singularly
quiet
and
abstracted
that
day
and
indeed
for
several
days
after
deephaven
was
a
land
in
which
it
seemed
always
afternoon
we
breakfasted
so
late
as
kew
had
said
there
was
a
power
of
china
kate
and
i
were
convinced
that
the
lives
of
her
grandmothers
must
have
been
spent
in
giving
we
counted
ten
sets
of
cups
beside
quantities
of
stray
ones
and
some
member
of
the
family
had
evidently
devoted
her
time
to
making
a
collection
of
pitchers
there
was
an
escritoire
in
miss
brandon
own
room
which
we
looked
over
one
day
there
was
a
little
package
of
letters
ship
letters
mostly
tied
with
a
very
pale
and
blue
ribbon
they
were
in
a
drawer
with
a
locket
holding
a
faded
miniature
on
ivory
and
a
lock
of
brown
hair
and
there
were
also
some
dry
twigs
and
bits
of
leaf
which
had
long
ago
been
bright
such
as
still
bloom
among
the
deephaven
rocks
kate
said
that
she
had
often
heard
her
mother
wonder
why
her
aunt
never
had
cared
to
marry
for
she
had
chances
enough
doubtless
and
had
been
rich
and
handsome
and
finely
educated
so
there
was
a
sailor
lover
after
all
and
perhaps
he
had
been
lost
at
sea
and
she
faithfully
kept
the
secret
never
mourning
outwardly
and
i
always
thought
her
the
most
old
lady
said
kate
yet
her
romance
after
all
we
put
the
letters
outside
on
a
chair
to
read
but
afterwards
carefully
replaced
them
without
untying
them
i
glad
we
did
there
were
other
letters
which
we
did
read
and
which
interested
us
very
much
letters
from
her
girl
friends
written
in
the
vacations
and
just
after
she
finished
school
those
in
one
of
the
smaller
packages
were
charming
it
must
have
been
such
a
bright
nice
girl
who
wrote
them
they
were
very
few
and
were
tied
with
black
ribbon
and
marked
on
the
outside
in
girlish
writing
my
dearest
friend
dolly
mcallister
died
september
aged
eighteen
the
ribbon
had
evidently
been
untied
and
the
letters
read
many
times
one
began
my
dear
delightful
kitten
i
am
quite
overjoyed
to
find
my
father
has
business
which
will
force
him
to
go
to
deephaven
next
week
and
he
kindly
says
if
there
be
no
more
rain
i
may
ride
with
him
to
see
you
i
will
surely
come
for
if
there
is
danger
of
spattering
my
gown
and
he
bids
me
stay
at
home
i
shall
go
galloping
after
him
and
overtake
him
when
it
is
too
late
to
send
me
back
i
have
so
much
to
tell
you
i
wish
i
knew
more
about
the
visit
poor
miss
katharine
it
made
us
sad
to
look
over
these
treasures
of
her
girlhood
there
were
her
compositions
and
some
samplers
and
queer
little
keepsakes
withered
flowers
and
some
pebbles
and
other
things
of
like
value
with
which
there
was
probably
some
pleasant
association
only
think
of
her
keeping
them
all
her
days
said
i
to
kate
i
am
continually
throwing
some
relic
of
the
kind
away
because
i
forget
why
i
have
it
there
was
a
box
in
the
lower
part
which
kate
was
glad
to
find
for
she
had
heard
her
mother
wonder
if
some
such
things
were
not
in
existence
it
held
a
crucifix
and
a
and
some
rosaries
and
kate
told
me
miss
katharine
youngest
and
favorite
brother
had
become
a
roman
catholic
while
studying
in
europe
it
was
a
dreadful
blow
to
the
family
for
in
those
days
there
could
have
been
few
deeper
disgraces
to
the
brandon
family
than
to
have
one
of
its
sons
go
over
to
popery
only
miss
katharine
treated
him
with
kindness
and
after
a
time
he
disappeared
without
telling
even
her
where
he
was
going
and
was
only
heard
from
indirectly
once
or
twice
afterward
it
was
a
great
grief
to
her
and
mamma
knows
said
kate
that
she
always
had
a
lingering
hope
of
his
return
for
one
of
the
last
times
she
saw
aunt
katharine
before
she
was
ill
she
spoke
of
soon
going
to
be
with
all
the
rest
and
said
your
uncle
henry
dear
and
stopped
and
smiled
sadly
think
me
a
very
foolish
old
woman
but
i
never
quite
gave
up
thinking
he
might
come
home
kew
did
the
honors
of
the
lighthouse
thoroughly
on
our
first
visit
but
i
think
we
rarely
went
to
see
her
that
we
did
not
make
some
entertaining
discovery
kew
nephew
a
guileless
youth
of
forty
lived
with
them
and
the
two
men
were
of
a
mechanical
turn
and
had
invented
numerous
aids
to
housekeeping
appendages
to
the
stove
and
fixtures
on
the
walls
for
everything
that
could
be
hung
up
catches
in
the
floor
to
hold
the
doors
open
and
ingenious
apparatus
to
close
them
but
above
all
a
system
of
barring
and
bolting
for
the
wide
fore
door
which
would
have
disconcerted
an
energetic
after
all
this
work
being
expended
kew
informed
us
that
it
was
usually
wide
open
all
night
in
summer
weather
on
the
back
of
this
door
i
discovered
one
day
a
row
of
marks
and
asked
their
significance
it
seemed
that
kew
had
attempted
one
summer
to
keep
count
of
the
number
of
people
who
inquired
about
the
depredations
of
the
chickens
kew
bedroom
was
partly
devoted
to
the
fine
arts
there
was
a
large
collection
of
likenesses
of
her
relatives
and
friends
on
the
wall
which
was
interesting
in
the
extreme
kew
was
always
much
pleased
to
tell
their
names
and
her
remarks
about
any
feature
not
exactly
perfect
were
very
searching
and
critical
that
my
oldest
brother
wife
clorinthy
adams
that
was
she
well
featured
if
it
were
not
for
her
nose
and
that
looks
as
if
it
had
been
thrown
at
her
and
she
was
particular
about
having
it
on
firm
in
hopes
of
getting
a
better
one
she
sets
by
her
looks
though
there
were
often
that
came
there
from
up
and
down
the
coast
one
day
kate
and
i
were
spending
the
afternoon
at
the
light
we
had
been
fishing
and
were
sitting
in
the
doorway
listening
to
a
reminiscence
of
the
winter
kew
kept
school
at
the
four
corners
saw
a
boatful
coming
and
all
lost
our
tempers
kew
had
a
lame
ankle
and
kate
offered
to
go
up
with
the
visitors
there
were
some
girls
and
young
men
who
stood
on
the
rocks
awhile
and
then
asked
us
with
much
better
manners
than
the
people
who
usually
came
if
they
could
see
the
lighthouse
and
kate
led
the
way
she
was
dressed
that
day
in
a
costume
we
both
frequently
wore
of
gray
skirts
and
blue
and
her
boots
were
much
the
worse
for
wear
the
celebrated
lancaster
complexion
was
rather
darkened
by
the
sun
kew
expressed
a
wish
to
know
what
questions
they
would
ask
her
and
i
followed
after
a
few
minutes
they
seemed
to
have
finished
asking
about
the
lantern
and
to
have
become
personal
do
you
get
tired
staying
here
no
indeed
said
kate
is
that
your
sister
down
stairs
no
i
have
no
sister
i
should
think
you
would
wish
she
was
are
you
ever
lonesome
everybody
is
sometimes
said
kate
but
it
such
a
lonesome
place
said
one
of
the
girls
i
should
think
you
would
get
work
away
i
live
in
boston
why
it
so
awful
quiet
nothing
but
the
water
and
the
wind
when
it
blows
and
i
think
either
of
them
is
worse
than
nothing
and
only
this
little
bit
of
a
rocky
place
i
should
want
to
go
to
walk
i
heard
kate
pleasantly
refuse
the
offer
of
pay
for
her
services
and
then
they
began
to
come
down
the
steep
stairs
laughing
and
chattering
with
each
other
kate
stayed
behind
to
close
the
doors
and
leave
everything
all
right
and
the
girl
who
had
talked
the
most
waited
too
and
when
they
were
on
the
stairs
just
above
me
and
the
others
out
of
hearing
she
said
you
real
good
to
show
us
the
things
i
guess
you
think
i
silly
but
i
do
like
you
ever
so
much
i
wish
you
would
come
to
boston
i
in
a
real
nice
store
h
on
winter
street
and
they
will
want
new
saleswomen
in
october
perhaps
you
could
be
at
my
counter
i
teach
you
and
you
could
board
with
me
i
got
a
real
comfortable
room
and
i
suppose
i
might
have
more
things
for
i
get
good
pay
but
i
like
to
send
money
home
to
mother
i
at
my
aunt
now
but
i
am
going
back
next
monday
and
if
you
will
tell
me
what
your
name
is
i
find
out
for
certain
about
the
place
and
write
you
my
name
mary
wendell
i
knew
by
kate
voice
that
this
had
touched
her
you
are
very
kind
thank
you
heartily
said
she
but
i
can
not
go
and
work
with
you
i
should
like
to
know
more
about
you
i
live
in
boston
too
my
friend
and
i
are
staying
over
in
deephaven
for
the
summer
only
and
she
held
out
her
hand
to
the
girl
whose
face
had
changed
from
its
first
expression
of
earnest
to
a
very
startled
one
and
when
she
noticed
kate
hand
and
a
ring
of
hers
which
had
been
turned
round
she
looked
really
frightened
o
will
you
please
excuse
me
said
she
blushing
i
ought
to
have
known
better
but
you
showed
us
round
so
willing
and
i
never
thought
of
your
not
living
here
i
did
mean
to
be
rude
of
course
you
did
not
and
you
were
not
i
am
very
glad
you
said
it
and
glad
you
like
me
said
kate
and
just
then
the
party
called
the
girl
and
she
hurried
away
and
i
joined
kate
then
you
heard
it
all
that
was
worth
having
said
she
she
was
such
an
honest
little
soul
and
i
mean
to
look
for
her
when
i
get
home
sometimes
we
used
to
go
out
to
the
light
early
in
the
morning
with
the
fishermen
who
went
that
way
to
the
but
we
usually
made
the
voyage
early
in
the
afternoon
if
it
were
not
too
hot
and
we
went
fishing
off
the
rocks
or
sat
in
the
house
with
kew
who
often
related
some
of
her
vermont
experiences
or
kew
would
tell
us
surprising
and
like
a
sailor
then
we
would
have
an
unreasonably
good
supper
and
afterward
climb
the
ladder
to
the
lantern
to
see
the
lamps
lighted
and
sit
there
for
a
while
watching
the
ships
and
the
sunset
almost
all
the
coasters
came
in
sight
of
deephaven
and
the
sea
outside
the
light
was
their
grand
highway
twice
from
the
lighthouse
we
saw
a
yacht
squadron
like
a
flock
of
great
white
birds
as
for
the
sunsets
it
used
to
seem
often
as
if
we
were
near
the
heart
of
them
for
the
sea
all
around
us
caught
the
color
of
the
clouds
and
though
the
glory
was
wonderful
i
remember
best
one
still
evening
when
there
was
a
bank
of
heavy
gray
clouds
in
the
west
shutting
down
like
a
curtain
and
the
sea
was
you
could
look
under
and
beyond
the
curtain
of
clouds
into
the
palest
clearest
yellow
sky
there
was
a
little
black
boat
in
the
distance
drifting
slowly
climbing
one
white
wave
after
another
as
if
it
were
bound
out
into
that
other
world
beyond
but
presently
the
sun
came
from
behind
the
clouds
and
the
dazzling
golden
light
changed
the
look
of
everything
and
it
was
the
time
then
to
say
one
thought
it
a
beautiful
sunset
while
before
one
could
only
keep
very
still
and
watch
the
boat
and
wonder
if
heaven
would
not
be
somehow
like
that
far
faint
color
which
was
neither
sea
nor
sky
when
we
came
down
from
the
lighthouse
and
it
grew
late
we
would
beg
for
an
hour
or
two
longer
on
the
water
and
row
away
in
the
twilight
far
out
from
land
where
with
our
faces
turned
from
the
light
it
seemed
as
if
we
were
alone
and
the
sea
shoreless
and
as
the
darkness
closed
round
us
softly
we
watched
the
stars
come
out
and
were
always
glad
to
see
kate
star
and
my
star
which
we
had
chosen
when
we
were
children
i
used
long
ago
to
be
sure
of
one
thing
that
however
far
away
heaven
might
be
it
could
not
be
out
of
sight
of
the
stars
sometimes
in
the
evening
we
waited
out
at
sea
for
the
moonrise
and
then
we
would
take
the
oars
again
and
go
slowly
in
once
in
a
while
singing
or
talking
but
oftenest
silent
lady
brandon
and
the
widow
when
it
was
known
that
we
had
arrived
in
deephaven
the
people
who
had
known
miss
brandon
so
well
and
lancaster
also
seemed
to
consider
themselves
kate
friends
by
inheritance
and
were
exceedingly
polite
to
us
in
either
calling
upon
us
or
sending
pleasant
messages
before
the
first
week
had
ended
we
had
no
lack
of
society
they
were
not
strangers
to
kate
to
begin
with
and
as
for
me
i
think
it
is
easy
for
me
to
be
contented
and
to
feel
at
home
anywhere
i
have
the
good
fortune
and
the
misfortune
to
belong
to
the
navy
that
is
my
father
does
and
my
life
has
been
consequently
an
unsettled
one
except
during
the
years
of
my
school
life
when
my
friendship
with
kate
began
i
think
i
should
be
happy
in
any
town
if
i
were
living
there
with
kate
lancaster
i
will
not
praise
my
friend
as
i
can
praise
her
or
say
half
the
things
i
might
say
honestly
she
is
so
fresh
and
good
and
true
and
enjoys
life
so
heartily
she
is
so
without
being
childish
and
i
do
not
tell
you
that
she
is
faultless
but
when
she
makes
mistakes
she
is
sorrier
and
more
ready
to
hopefully
try
again
than
any
girl
i
know
perhaps
you
would
like
to
know
something
about
us
but
i
am
not
writing
kate
biography
and
my
own
only
telling
you
of
one
summer
which
we
spent
together
sometimes
in
deephaven
we
were
between
six
and
seven
years
old
but
at
other
times
we
have
felt
irreparably
and
as
if
we
carried
a
crushing
weight
of
care
and
duty
in
reality
we
are
both
and
it
is
a
pleasant
age
though
i
think
next
year
is
sure
to
be
pleasanter
for
we
do
not
mind
growing
older
since
we
have
lost
nothing
that
we
mourn
about
and
are
gaining
so
much
i
shall
be
glad
if
you
learn
to
know
kate
a
little
in
my
stories
it
is
not
that
i
am
fond
of
her
and
endow
her
with
imagined
virtues
and
graces
no
one
can
fail
to
see
how
unaffected
she
is
or
not
notice
her
thoughtfulness
and
generosity
and
her
delightful
fun
which
never
has
a
trace
of
coarseness
or
silliness
it
was
very
pleasant
having
her
for
companion
for
she
has
an
unusual
power
of
winning
people
confidence
and
of
knowing
with
surest
instinct
how
to
meet
them
on
their
own
ground
it
is
the
girl
being
so
genuinely
sympathetic
and
interested
which
makes
every
one
ready
to
talk
to
her
and
be
friends
with
her
just
as
the
sunshine
makes
it
easy
for
flowers
to
grow
which
the
chilly
winds
hinder
she
is
not
polite
for
the
sake
of
seeming
polite
but
polite
for
the
sake
of
being
kind
and
there
is
not
a
particle
of
what
hugh
miller
justly
calls
the
insolence
of
condescension
about
her
she
is
not
brilliantly
talented
yet
she
does
everything
in
a
charming
fashion
of
her
own
she
is
not
profoundly
learned
yet
she
knows
much
of
which
many
wise
people
are
ignorant
and
while
she
is
a
patient
scholar
in
both
little
things
and
great
she
is
no
less
a
teacher
to
all
her
friends
dear
kate
lancaster
we
knew
that
we
were
considered
miss
brandon
representatives
in
deephaven
society
and
this
was
no
slight
responsibility
as
she
had
received
much
honor
and
respect
we
heard
again
and
again
what
a
loss
she
had
been
to
the
town
and
we
tried
that
summer
to
do
nothing
to
lessen
the
family
reputation
and
to
give
pleasure
as
well
as
take
it
though
we
were
singularly
persistent
in
our
pursuit
of
a
good
time
i
grew
much
interested
in
what
i
heard
of
miss
brandon
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
a
great
privilege
to
have
an
elderly
person
in
neighborhood
in
town
or
country
who
is
proud
and
conservative
and
who
lives
in
stately
fashion
who
is
intolerant
of
sham
and
of
useless
novelties
and
clings
to
the
old
ways
of
living
and
behaving
as
if
it
were
part
of
her
religion
there
is
something
immensely
respectable
about
the
gentlewomen
of
the
old
school
they
ignore
all
bustle
and
flashiness
and
the
conceit
of
the
younger
people
who
act
as
if
at
last
it
had
been
time
for
them
to
appear
and
manage
this
world
as
it
ought
to
have
been
managed
before
their
position
in
modern
society
is
much
like
that
of
the
king
chapel
in
its
busy
street
in
boston
it
perhaps
might
not
have
been
easy
to
approach
miss
brandon
but
i
am
sure
that
if
i
had
visited
in
deephaven
during
her
lifetime
i
should
have
been
very
proud
if
i
had
been
asked
to
take
tea
at
her
house
and
should
have
liked
to
speak
afterward
of
my
acquaintance
with
her
it
would
have
been
impossible
not
to
pay
her
great
deference
it
is
a
pleasure
to
think
that
she
must
have
found
this
world
a
most
polite
world
and
have
had
the
highest
opinion
of
its
good
manners
that
is
true
in
more
ways
than
one
i
can
not
help
wondering
if
those
of
us
who
will
be
left
by
and
by
to
represent
our
own
generation
will
seem
to
have
such
superior
elegance
of
behavior
if
we
shall
receive
so
much
respect
and
be
so
much
valued
it
is
hard
to
imagine
it
we
know
that
the
world
gains
new
refinements
and
a
better
culture
but
to
us
there
never
will
be
such
imposing
ladies
and
gentlemen
as
these
who
belong
to
the
old
school
the
morning
after
we
reached
deephaven
we
were
busy
up
stairs
and
there
was
a
determined
blow
at
the
knocker
of
the
front
door
i
went
down
to
see
who
was
there
and
had
the
pleasure
of
receiving
our
first
caller
she
was
a
prim
little
old
woman
who
looked
pleased
and
expectant
who
wore
a
neat
cap
and
front
and
whose
eyes
were
as
bright
as
black
beads
she
wore
no
bonnet
and
had
thrown
a
little
shawl
with
figures
over
her
shoulders
and
it
was
evident
that
she
was
a
near
neighbor
she
was
very
short
and
straight
and
thin
and
so
quick
that
she
darted
like
a
pickerel
when
she
moved
about
it
occurred
to
me
at
once
that
she
was
a
very
capable
person
and
had
faculty
and
dear
me
how
fast
she
talked
she
hesitated
a
moment
when
she
saw
me
and
dropped
a
fragment
of
a
courtesy
miss
said
she
doubtfully
no
said
i
i
miss
denis
miss
lancaster
is
at
home
though
come
in
wo
you
o
mrs
patton
said
kate
who
came
down
just
then
how
very
kind
of
you
to
come
over
so
soon
i
should
have
gone
to
see
you
i
was
asking
kew
last
night
if
you
were
here
land
o
compassion
said
patton
as
she
shook
kate
hand
delightedly
where
ye
i
be
dear
i
ai
like
to
move
away
from
deephaven
now
after
i
held
by
the
place
so
long
i
got
as
many
roots
as
the
big
ellum
well
i
should
know
you
were
a
brandon
no
matter
where
i
see
you
you
got
a
real
brandon
look
tall
and
straight
ai
you
it
four
or
five
years
since
i
saw
you
except
once
at
church
and
once
you
went
by
down
to
the
shore
i
suppose
it
was
a
windy
day
in
the
spring
of
the
year
i
remember
it
very
well
said
kate
those
were
both
visits
of
only
a
day
or
two
and
i
was
here
at
aunt
katharine
funeral
and
went
away
that
same
evening
do
you
remember
once
i
was
here
in
the
summer
for
a
longer
visit
five
or
six
years
ago
and
i
helped
you
pick
currants
in
the
garden
you
had
a
very
old
mug
now
whoever
would
ha
thought
o
your
that
said
patton
yes
i
had
that
mug
because
it
was
handy
to
carry
about
among
the
bushes
and
then
i
empt
it
into
the
basket
as
fast
as
i
got
it
full
your
aunt
always
told
me
to
pick
all
i
wanted
she
could
use
but
they
used
to
make
sights
o
currant
wine
in
old
times
i
that
mug
would
be
considerable
of
a
curiosity
to
anybody
that
used
to
seeing
it
round
my
joseph
toggerson
my
mother
was
a
toggerson
picked
it
up
on
the
long
sands
in
a
wad
of
strange
it
was
broke
but
it
tough
i
dropped
it
on
the
floor
the
time
and
it
ai
even
chipped
there
some
dutch
reading
on
it
and
it
marked
now
i
should
ha
thought
you
remembered
that
old
mug
i
declare
your
aunt
she
had
a
monstrous
sight
of
chiny
told
me
where
all
of
it
come
from
but
i
expect
i
forgot
my
memory
fails
me
a
good
deal
by
spells
if
you
had
come
down
i
suppose
your
mother
would
have
had
the
chiny
packed
up
this
spring
what
she
did
take
with
her
after
your
aunt
died
she
has
made
up
her
mind
what
to
do
with
the
house
no
said
kate
she
wishes
she
could
it
is
a
great
puzzle
to
us
i
hope
you
will
find
it
in
middling
order
said
patton
humbly
me
and
mis
dockum
have
done
the
best
we
knew
opened
the
windows
and
let
in
the
air
and
tried
to
keep
it
from
getting
damp
i
fixed
all
the
woollens
with
fresh
camphire
and
tobacco
the
last
o
the
winter
you
have
to
be
dreadful
careful
in
one
o
these
old
houses
everything
gets
creaking
with
moths
in
no
time
miss
katharine
how
she
did
hate
the
sight
of
a
there
something
i
speak
about
before
i
forget
it
the
mice
have
eat
the
backs
of
a
pile
o
old
books
stored
away
in
the
west
chamber
closet
next
to
miss
katharine
room
and
i
set
a
trap
there
but
it
was
older
the
ten
commandments
that
trap
was
and
the
spring
rusty
i
guess
you
better
get
some
new
ones
and
set
round
in
different
places
the
mice
pester
you
there
ai
been
no
chance
for
to
get
much
of
a
living
through
the
winter
but
they
be
sure
to
come
back
quick
as
they
find
likely
to
be
good
board
i
see
your
aunt
cat
setting
out
on
the
front
steps
she
never
was
no
great
of
a
mouser
but
it
went
to
my
heart
to
see
how
pleased
she
looks
come
right
back
did
she
how
they
do
hold
to
their
old
haunts
was
that
miss
brandon
cat
i
asked
with
great
interest
she
has
been
up
stairs
with
us
but
i
supposed
she
belonged
to
some
neighbor
and
had
strayed
in
she
behaved
as
if
she
felt
at
home
poor
old
pussy
we
must
keep
her
here
said
kate
mis
dockum
took
her
after
your
mother
went
off
and
miss
maids
said
patton
but
she
told
me
that
it
was
a
long
spell
before
she
seemed
to
feel
contented
she
used
to
set
on
the
steps
and
cry
by
the
hour
together
and
try
to
get
in
to
first
one
door
and
then
another
i
used
to
think
how
bad
miss
katharine
would
feel
she
set
a
great
deal
by
a
cat
and
she
took
notice
of
this
as
long
as
she
did
of
anything
her
mind
failed
her
you
know
great
loss
to
deephaven
she
was
proud
woman
and
some
folks
were
scared
of
her
but
i
always
got
along
with
her
and
i
would
ask
for
no
kinder
friend
nor
neighbor
i
had
my
troubles
and
i
seen
the
day
i
was
suffering
poor
and
i
could
have
brought
myself
to
ask
town
help
nohow
but
i
wish
ye
heared
her
scold
me
when
she
found
it
out
and
she
come
marching
into
my
kitchen
one
morning
like
a
grenadier
and
says
she
did
you
send
and
tell
me
how
sick
and
poor
you
are
says
she
and
she
said
she
ha
been
so
glad
to
help
me
all
along
but
she
thought
i
had
means
everybody
did
and
i
see
the
tears
in
her
eyes
but
she
was
scolding
me
and
speaking
as
if
she
was
dreadful
mad
she
made
me
comfortable
and
she
sent
over
one
o
her
maids
to
see
to
me
and
got
the
doctor
and
a
load
o
stuff
come
up
from
the
store
so
i
did
have
to
buy
anything
for
a
good
many
weeks
i
got
better
and
so
to
work
but
she
never
let
me
say
nothing
about
it
i
had
a
good
deal
trouble
and
i
thought
i
lost
my
health
but
i
had
and
that
was
thirty
or
forty
years
ago
there
never
was
nothing
going
on
at
the
great
house
that
she
did
have
me
over
sewing
or
cleaning
or
company
and
i
got
so
that
i
knew
how
she
liked
to
have
things
done
i
felt
as
if
it
was
my
own
sister
though
i
never
had
one
when
i
was
going
over
to
help
lay
her
out
she
used
to
talk
as
free
to
me
as
she
would
to
miss
lorimer
or
miss
carew
i
ye
ai
seen
nothing
o
them
yet
she
was
a
good
christian
woman
miss
katharine
was
memory
of
the
just
is
blessed
that
what
lorimer
said
in
his
sermon
the
sunday
after
she
died
and
there
was
a
there
to
hear
it
i
declare
it
looked
pitiful
to
see
that
pew
empty
that
ought
to
ha
been
the
mourners
pew
your
mother
mis
lancaster
had
to
go
home
saturday
your
father
was
going
away
sudden
to
washington
i
understood
and
she
come
back
again
the
first
of
the
week
there
it
did
make
no
sort
o
difference
nobody
thought
of
it
but
me
there
had
been
anybody
in
the
pew
more
than
a
couple
o
times
since
she
used
to
sit
there
herself
regular
as
sunday
come
and
patton
looked
for
a
minute
as
if
she
were
going
to
cry
but
she
changed
her
mind
upon
second
thought
your
mother
gave
me
most
of
miss
katharine
clothes
this
cap
belonged
to
her
that
i
got
on
now
it
wore
out
but
it
does
for
mornings
o
said
kate
i
have
two
new
ones
for
you
in
one
of
my
trunks
mamma
meant
to
choose
them
herself
but
she
had
not
time
and
so
she
told
me
and
i
think
i
found
the
kind
she
thought
you
would
like
now
i
sure
said
patton
if
that
ai
kind
you
do
tell
me
that
mis
lancaster
thought
of
me
just
as
she
was
going
off
i
shall
set
everything
by
them
caps
and
i
much
obliged
to
you
too
miss
kate
i
was
just
going
to
speak
of
that
time
you
were
here
and
saw
the
mug
you
trimmed
a
cap
for
miss
katharine
to
give
me
real
boston
style
i
guess
that
box
of
is
up
on
the
top
shelf
of
miss
closet
now
to
the
left
hand
said
patton
with
wistful
certainty
she
used
to
make
her
caps
herself
and
she
had
some
beautiful
materials
laid
away
that
she
never
used
some
folks
has
laughed
at
me
for
being
so
particular
wearing
caps
except
for
best
but
i
know
it
presuming
beyond
my
station
and
somehow
i
feel
more
respect
for
myself
when
i
have
a
good
cap
on
i
ca
get
over
your
about
me
and
she
sent
me
a
handsome
present
o
money
this
spring
for
looking
after
the
house
i
never
should
have
asked
for
a
cent
it
a
pleasure
to
me
to
keep
an
eye
on
it
out
o
respect
to
your
aunt
i
was
so
pleased
when
i
heard
you
were
coming
long
o
your
friend
i
like
to
see
the
old
place
open
it
was
about
as
bad
as
having
no
meeting
i
miss
seeing
the
lights
and
your
aunt
was
a
great
hand
for
lighting
up
bright
the
big
hall
lantern
was
lit
every
night
and
she
put
it
out
when
she
went
up
stairs
she
liked
to
go
round
same
if
it
was
day
you
see
i
forget
all
the
time
she
was
sick
and
go
back
to
the
days
when
she
was
well
and
about
the
house
when
her
mind
was
failing
her
and
she
was
up
stairs
in
her
room
her
eyesight
seemed
to
be
lost
part
of
the
time
and
sometimes
she
tell
us
to
get
the
lamp
and
a
couple
o
candles
in
the
middle
o
the
day
and
then
she
be
as
satisfied
but
she
used
to
take
a
notion
to
set
in
the
dark
some
nights
and
think
i
i
should
have
forty
fits
if
i
undertook
it
that
was
a
good
while
ago
and
do
you
how
she
used
to
play
the
piano
she
used
to
be
a
great
hand
to
play
when
she
was
young
indeed
i
remember
it
said
kate
who
told
me
afterward
how
her
aunt
used
to
sit
at
the
piano
in
the
twilight
and
play
to
herself
she
was
formerly
a
skilful
musician
said
my
friend
though
one
would
not
have
imagined
she
cared
for
music
when
i
was
a
child
she
used
to
play
in
company
of
an
evening
and
once
when
i
was
here
one
of
her
old
friends
asked
for
a
tune
and
she
laughingly
said
that
her
day
was
over
and
her
fingers
were
stiff
though
i
believe
she
might
have
played
as
well
as
ever
then
if
she
had
cared
to
try
but
once
in
a
while
when
she
had
been
quiet
all
day
and
rather
sad
i
am
ashamed
that
i
used
to
think
she
was
cross
she
would
open
the
piano
and
sit
there
until
late
while
i
used
to
be
enchanted
by
her
memories
of
and
old
psalms
and
marches
and
songs
there
was
one
tune
which
i
am
sure
had
a
history
there
was
a
sweet
wild
cadence
in
it
and
she
would
come
back
to
it
again
and
again
always
going
through
with
it
in
the
same
measured
way
i
have
remembered
so
many
things
about
my
aunt
since
i
have
been
here
said
kate
which
i
hardly
noticed
and
did
not
understand
when
they
happened
i
was
afraid
of
her
when
i
was
a
little
girl
but
i
think
if
i
had
grown
up
sooner
i
should
have
enjoyed
her
heartily
it
never
used
to
occur
to
me
that
she
had
a
spark
of
tenderness
or
of
sentiment
until
just
before
she
was
ill
but
i
have
been
growing
more
fond
of
her
ever
since
i
might
have
given
her
a
great
deal
more
pleasure
it
was
not
long
after
i
was
through
school
that
she
became
so
feeble
and
of
course
she
liked
best
having
mamma
come
to
see
her
one
of
us
had
to
be
at
home
i
have
thought
lately
how
careful
one
ought
to
be
to
be
kind
and
thoughtful
to
one
old
friends
it
is
so
soon
too
late
to
be
good
to
them
and
then
one
is
always
so
sorry
i
must
tell
you
more
of
patton
of
course
it
was
not
long
before
we
returned
her
call
and
we
were
much
entertained
we
always
liked
to
see
our
friends
in
their
own
houses
her
house
was
a
little
way
down
the
road
unpainted
and
but
so
low
that
the
old
which
clustered
round
it
were
as
tall
as
the
eaves
the
widow
jim
as
nearly
every
one
called
her
in
distinction
to
the
widow
jack
patton
who
was
a
tailoress
and
lived
at
the
other
end
of
the
town
was
a
very
useful
person
i
suppose
there
must
be
her
counterpart
in
all
old
new
england
villages
she
sewed
and
she
made
elaborate
rugs
and
she
had
a
decided
talent
for
making
carpets
if
there
were
one
to
be
made
which
must
have
happened
seldom
but
there
were
a
great
many
to
be
turned
and
made
over
in
deephaven
and
she
went
to
the
carews
and
lorimers
at
time
or
in
seasons
of
great
festivity
she
had
no
equal
in
sickness
and
knew
how
to
brew
every
dose
and
to
make
every
variety
of
and
when
her
nursing
was
put
to
an
end
by
her
patient
death
she
was
at
the
funeral
and
stood
near
the
doorway
to
direct
the
mourning
friends
to
their
seats
and
i
have
no
reason
to
doubt
that
she
sometimes
even
had
the
immense
responsibility
of
making
out
the
order
of
the
procession
since
she
had
all
genealogy
and
relationship
at
her
tongue
end
it
was
an
awful
thing
in
deephaven
we
found
if
the
precedence
was
wrongly
assigned
and
once
we
chanced
to
hear
some
bitter
remarks
because
the
cousins
of
the
departed
wife
had
been
placed
after
the
husband
relatives
the
ridin
behind
them
that
was
only
kin
by
marriage
i
do
wonder
they
felt
hurt
said
the
person
who
spoke
a
most
unselfish
and
unassuming
soul
ordinarily
patton
knew
everybody
secrets
but
she
told
them
judiciously
if
at
all
she
chattered
all
day
to
you
as
a
sparrow
twitters
and
you
did
not
tire
of
her
and
kate
and
i
were
never
more
agreeably
entertained
than
when
she
told
us
of
old
times
and
of
kate
ancestors
and
their
contemporaries
for
her
memory
was
wonderful
and
she
had
either
seen
everything
that
had
happened
in
deephaven
for
a
long
time
or
had
received
the
particulars
from
reliable
witnesses
she
had
known
much
trouble
her
husband
had
been
but
small
satisfaction
to
her
and
it
was
not
to
be
wondered
at
if
she
looked
upon
all
proposed
marriages
with
compassion
she
was
always
early
at
church
and
she
wore
the
same
bonnet
that
she
had
when
kate
was
a
child
it
was
such
a
proper
black
straw
bonnet
with
discreet
bows
of
ribbon
and
a
useful
lace
veil
to
protect
it
from
the
weather
she
showed
us
into
the
best
room
the
first
time
we
went
to
see
her
it
was
the
plainest
little
room
and
very
dull
and
there
was
an
exact
sufficiency
about
its
furnishings
yet
there
was
a
certain
dignity
about
it
it
was
unmistakably
a
best
room
and
not
a
place
where
one
might
make
a
litter
or
carry
one
work
you
felt
at
once
that
somebody
valued
the
prim
chairs
and
the
two
tables
and
the
thin
carpet
which
must
have
needed
anxious
stretching
every
spring
to
make
it
come
to
the
edge
of
the
floor
there
were
some
by
way
of
decoration
inscribed
with
the
names
of
patton
departed
friends
two
worked
in
crewel
to
the
memory
of
her
father
and
mother
and
two
paper
memorials
with
the
woman
weeping
under
the
willow
at
the
side
of
a
monument
they
were
all
brown
with
age
and
there
was
a
sampler
beside
worked
by
judith
beckett
aged
ten
and
all
five
were
framed
in
slender
black
frames
and
hung
very
high
on
the
walls
there
was
a
which
looked
as
if
it
felt
too
grand
for
use
and
considered
itself
imposing
it
tilted
far
back
on
its
rockers
and
was
bent
forward
at
the
top
to
make
one
head
uncomfortable
it
need
not
have
troubled
itself
nobody
would
ever
wish
to
sit
there
it
was
such
a
big
and
patton
was
proud
of
it
always
generously
urging
her
guests
to
enjoy
its
comfort
which
was
imaginary
with
her
as
she
was
so
short
that
she
could
hardly
have
climbed
into
it
without
assistance
patton
was
a
little
ceremonious
at
first
but
soon
recovered
herself
and
told
us
a
great
deal
which
we
were
glad
to
hear
i
asked
her
once
if
she
had
not
always
lived
at
deephaven
here
and
beyond
east
parish
said
she
patton
that
was
my
husband
he
owned
a
good
farm
there
when
i
married
him
but
i
come
back
here
again
after
he
died
place
was
all
mortgaged
i
never
got
a
cent
and
i
was
poorer
than
when
i
started
i
worked
harder
ever
i
did
before
or
since
to
keep
things
together
but
was
any
kind
o
use
your
mother
knows
all
about
it
miss
kate
as
if
we
might
not
be
willing
to
believe
it
on
her
authority
i
come
back
here
a
widow
and
destitute
and
i
tell
you
the
world
looked
fair
to
me
when
i
left
this
house
first
to
go
over
there
do
you
run
no
risks
you
better
off
as
you
be
dears
but
land
sakes
alive
did
mean
no
hurt
and
he
set
everything
by
me
when
he
was
himself
i
do
make
no
scruples
of
speaking
about
it
everybody
knows
how
it
was
but
i
did
go
through
with
everything
i
never
knew
what
the
day
would
bring
forth
said
the
widow
as
if
this
were
the
first
time
she
had
had
a
chance
to
tell
her
sorrows
to
a
sympathizing
audience
she
did
not
seem
to
mind
talking
about
the
troubles
of
her
married
life
any
more
than
a
soldier
minds
telling
the
story
of
his
campaigns
and
dwells
with
pride
on
the
worst
battle
of
all
her
favorite
subject
always
was
miss
brandon
and
after
a
pause
she
said
that
she
hoped
we
were
finding
everything
right
in
the
house
she
had
meant
to
take
up
the
carpet
in
the
best
spare
room
but
it
did
seem
to
need
it
it
was
taken
up
the
year
before
and
the
room
had
not
been
used
since
there
was
not
a
mite
of
dust
under
it
last
time
and
kate
assured
her
with
an
appearance
of
great
wisdom
that
she
did
not
think
it
could
be
necessary
at
all
i
come
home
and
had
a
good
cry
yesterday
after
i
was
over
to
see
you
said
patton
and
i
could
not
help
wondering
if
she
really
could
cry
for
she
looked
so
perfectly
dried
up
so
dry
that
she
might
rustle
in
the
wind
your
aunt
had
been
failin
so
long
that
just
after
she
died
it
was
a
relief
but
i
got
so
to
forget
all
about
that
and
i
miss
her
as
she
used
to
be
it
seemed
as
if
you
had
stepped
into
her
place
and
you
look
some
as
she
used
to
when
she
was
young
you
must
miss
her
said
kate
and
i
know
how
much
she
used
to
depend
upon
you
you
were
very
kind
to
her
i
sat
up
with
her
the
night
she
died
said
the
widow
with
mournful
satisfaction
i
have
lived
neighbor
to
her
all
my
life
except
the
thirteen
years
i
was
married
and
there
was
a
week
i
was
over
to
the
great
house
except
i
was
off
to
a
distance
taking
care
of
the
sick
when
she
got
to
be
feeble
she
always
wanted
me
to
to
the
cleaning
and
to
see
to
putting
the
canopies
and
curtains
on
the
bedsteads
and
she
would
trust
nobody
but
me
to
handle
some
of
the
best
china
i
used
to
say
katharine
why
do
you
have
some
young
folks
come
and
stop
with
you
there
mis
lancaster
daughter
a
growing
up
but
she
did
seem
to
care
for
nobody
but
your
mother
you
would
believe
what
a
hand
she
used
to
be
for
company
in
her
younger
days
how
folks
alters
when
i
first
her
much
she
was
as
straight
as
an
arrow
and
she
used
to
go
to
boston
visiting
and
come
home
with
the
top
of
the
fashion
she
always
did
dress
elegant
it
used
to
be
gay
here
and
she
was
always
going
down
to
the
lorimers
or
the
carews
to
tea
and
they
coming
here
her
sister
was
married
she
was
a
good
deal
older
but
some
of
her
brothers
were
at
home
there
was
your
grandfather
and
henry
i
do
think
she
ever
got
it
over
his
disappearing
so
there
were
lots
of
folks
then
that
dead
and
gone
and
they
used
to
have
their
and
old
manning
he
dead
and
gone
used
to
have
all
to
play
whist
every
fortnight
sometimes
three
or
four
tables
and
they
always
had
cake
and
wine
handed
round
or
the
made
some
punch
like
not
with
oranges
in
it
and
lemons
knew
how
he
was
a
bachelor
to
the
end
of
his
days
the
old
was
but
he
used
to
entertain
real
handsome
i
one
night
they
was
a
after
the
wine
was
brought
in
and
he
upset
his
glass
all
over
miss
martha
lorimer
watered
silk
and
spoilt
the
better
part
of
two
breadths
she
sent
right
over
for
me
early
the
next
morning
to
see
if
i
knew
of
anything
to
take
out
the
spots
but
i
did
though
i
can
take
grease
out
o
most
any
material
we
tried
clear
alcohol
and
and
hartshorn
and
pouring
water
through
and
heating
of
it
and
when
we
got
through
it
was
worse
than
when
we
started
she
felt
dreadful
bad
about
it
and
at
last
she
says
we
wo
work
over
it
any
more
but
if
you
give
me
a
day
some
time
or
we
rip
it
up
and
make
a
quilt
of
it
i
see
that
quilt
last
time
i
was
in
miss
rebecca
north
chamber
miss
martha
was
her
aunt
you
never
saw
her
she
was
dead
and
gone
before
your
day
it
was
a
silk
old
peter
lorimer
her
brother
who
left
his
money
brought
home
from
sea
and
she
had
worn
it
for
best
and
second
best
eleven
year
it
looked
as
good
as
new
and
she
never
would
have
ripped
it
up
if
she
could
have
matched
it
i
said
it
seemed
to
be
a
shame
but
it
was
a
curi
figure
manning
fetched
her
one
to
pay
for
it
the
next
time
he
went
to
boston
she
did
want
to
take
it
but
he
would
take
no
for
an
answer
he
was
the
was
i
helped
make
it
of
mary
ann
simms
the
dressmaker
she
dead
and
gone
too
the
time
it
was
made
it
was
brown
and
a
piece
but
it
wore
shiny
and
she
made
a
of
it
before
she
died
patton
brought
kate
and
me
some
delicious
cake
with
much
spice
in
it
and
told
us
it
was
made
by
old
chantrey
receipt
which
she
got
in
england
that
it
would
keep
a
year
and
she
always
kept
a
loaf
by
her
now
that
she
could
afford
it
she
supposed
we
knew
miss
katharine
had
named
her
in
her
will
long
before
she
was
sick
it
has
put
me
beyond
fear
of
want
said
patton
i
wo
deny
that
i
used
to
think
it
would
go
hard
with
me
when
i
got
so
old
i
could
earn
my
living
you
see
i
never
laid
up
but
a
little
and
hard
for
a
woman
who
comes
of
respectable
folks
to
be
a
pauper
in
her
last
days
but
your
aunt
miss
kate
she
thought
of
it
too
and
i
sure
i
thankful
to
be
so
comfortable
and
to
stay
in
my
house
which
i
could
have
done
like
not
miss
rebecca
lorimer
said
to
me
after
i
got
news
of
the
will
mis
patton
you
do
suppose
your
friends
would
ever
have
let
you
want
and
i
says
friends
are
kind
the
lord
bless
but
i
feel
better
to
be
able
to
do
for
myself
than
to
be
beholden
after
this
long
call
we
went
down
to
the
and
coming
home
stopped
for
a
while
in
the
old
which
we
had
noticed
the
day
before
and
we
sat
for
the
first
time
on
the
great
stone
in
the
wall
in
the
shade
of
a
where
we
so
often
waited
afterward
for
the
stage
to
come
with
the
mail
or
rested
on
our
way
home
from
a
walk
it
was
a
comfortable
perch
we
used
to
read
our
letters
there
i
remember
i
must
tell
you
a
little
about
the
deephaven
for
its
interest
was
inexhaustible
and
i
do
not
know
how
much
time
we
may
have
spent
in
reading
the
long
epitaphs
on
the
and
trying
to
puzzle
out
the
inscriptions
which
were
often
so
old
and
worn
that
we
could
only
trace
a
letter
here
and
there
it
was
a
neglected
corner
of
the
world
and
there
were
straggling
sumachs
and
acacias
scattered
about
the
enclosure
while
a
row
of
fine
old
elms
marked
the
boundary
of
two
sides
the
grass
was
long
and
tangled
and
most
of
the
stones
leaned
one
way
or
the
other
and
some
had
fallen
flat
there
were
a
few
handsome
old
family
monuments
clustered
in
one
corner
among
which
the
one
that
marked
miss
brandon
grave
looked
so
new
and
fresh
that
it
seemed
inappropriate
it
should
have
been
dingy
to
begin
with
like
the
rest
said
kate
one
day
but
i
think
it
will
make
itself
look
like
its
neighbors
as
soon
as
possible
there
were
many
stones
which
were
sacred
to
the
memory
of
men
who
had
been
lost
at
sea
almost
always
giving
the
name
of
the
departed
ship
which
was
so
kept
in
remembrance
and
one
felt
as
much
interest
in
the
ship
starlight
supposed
to
have
foundered
off
the
cape
of
good
hope
as
in
the
poor
fellow
who
had
the
ill
luck
to
be
one
of
her
crew
there
were
dozens
of
such
inscriptions
and
there
were
other
stones
perpetuating
the
fame
of
honourable
gentlemen
who
had
been
members
of
his
majesty
council
or
surveyors
of
his
majesty
woods
or
officers
of
customs
for
the
town
of
deephaven
some
of
the
epitaphs
were
beautiful
showing
that
tenderness
for
the
friends
who
had
died
that
longing
to
do
them
justice
to
fully
acknowledge
their
virtues
and
dearness
which
is
so
touching
and
so
unmistakable
even
under
the
stiff
quaint
expressions
and
formal
words
which
were
thought
suitable
to
be
chiselled
on
the
stones
so
soon
to
be
looked
at
carelessly
by
the
tearless
eyes
of
strangers
we
often
used
to
notice
names
and
learn
their
history
from
the
old
people
whom
we
knew
and
in
this
way
we
heard
many
stories
which
we
never
shall
forget
it
is
wonderful
the
romance
and
tragedy
and
adventure
which
one
may
find
in
a
quiet
country
town
though
to
heartily
enjoy
the
life
one
must
care
to
study
life
and
character
and
must
find
pleasure
in
thought
and
observation
of
simple
things
and
have
an
instinctive
delicious
interest
in
what
to
other
eyes
is
unflavored
dulness
to
go
back
to
patton
on
our
way
home
after
our
first
call
upon
her
we
stopped
to
speak
to
dockum
who
mentioned
that
she
had
seen
us
going
in
to
the
widow
jim
willin
woman
said
dockum
always
been
respected
got
an
uncommon
facility
o
speech
i
never
saw
such
a
hand
to
talk
but
then
she
has
something
to
say
which
ai
the
case
with
everybody
good
neighbor
does
according
to
her
means
always
dreadful
tough
time
of
it
with
her
husband
and
drunk
all
his
time
noticed
that
dent
in
the
side
of
her
forehead
i
that
where
he
liked
to
have
killed
her
slung
a
stone
bottle
at
her
said
kate
and
i
very
much
shocked
she
do
like
to
have
it
inquired
about
but
she
and
i
were
sitting
up
with
damer
one
night
and
she
gave
me
the
particulars
i
knew
he
did
it
for
she
had
a
fit
o
sickness
afterward
had
sliced
cucumbers
for
breakfast
that
morning
he
was
very
partial
to
them
and
he
wanted
some
vinegar
happened
to
be
two
bottles
in
the
were
just
alike
and
one
of
was
vinegar
and
the
other
had
sperrit
in
it
at
he
takes
up
the
wrong
one
and
pours
on
quick
and
out
come
the
hayseed
and
flies
and
he
give
the
bottle
a
sling
and
it
hit
her
there
where
you
see
the
scar
might
put
the
end
of
your
finger
into
the
dent
he
said
he
meant
to
break
the
bottle
the
door
but
it
went
sort
of
i
don
know
i
sure
meditatively
she
said
he
was
it
was
early
in
the
mornin
and
he
had
had
time
to
get
upset
but
he
had
a
high
temper
naturally
and
so
much
drink
made
it
much
better
she
had
good
prospects
when
she
married
him
and
red
cheeks
and
straight
as
a
noroway
pine
had
a
good
property
from
his
father
and
his
mother
come
of
a
good
family
but
he
died
in
debt
drank
like
a
fish
yes
was
a
shame
nice
woman
good
consistent
always
been
respected
useful
among
the
sick
it
was
curious
to
notice
in
this
quaint
little
by
the
sea
how
clearly
the
gradations
of
society
were
defined
the
place
prided
itself
most
upon
having
been
long
ago
the
residence
of
one
governor
chantrey
who
was
a
rich
shipowner
and
east
india
merchant
and
whose
fame
and
magnificence
were
almost
fabulous
it
was
a
regret
that
his
house
should
have
burned
down
after
he
died
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
if
it
were
still
standing
it
would
rival
any
ruin
of
the
old
world
the
elderly
people
though
laying
claim
to
no
slight
degree
of
present
consequence
modestly
ignored
it
and
spoke
with
pride
of
the
grand
way
in
which
life
was
carried
on
by
their
ancestors
the
deephaven
families
of
old
times
i
think
kate
and
i
were
assured
at
least
a
hundred
times
that
governor
chantrey
kept
a
valet
and
his
wife
lady
chantrey
kept
a
maid
and
that
the
governor
had
an
uncle
in
england
who
was
a
baronet
and
i
believe
this
must
have
been
why
our
friends
felt
so
deep
an
interest
in
the
affairs
of
the
english
nobility
they
no
doubt
felt
themselves
entitled
to
seats
near
the
throne
itself
there
were
formerly
five
families
who
kept
their
coaches
in
deephaven
there
were
balls
at
the
governor
and
regal
entertainments
at
other
of
the
grand
mansions
there
is
not
a
really
distinguished
person
in
the
country
who
will
not
prove
to
have
been
directly
or
indirectly
connected
with
deephaven
we
were
shown
the
cellar
of
the
chantrey
house
and
the
terraces
and
a
few
clumps
of
lilacs
and
the
grand
rows
of
elms
there
are
still
two
of
the
governor
warehouses
left
but
his
ruined
wharves
are
fast
disappearing
and
are
almost
deserted
except
by
small
barefooted
boys
who
sit
on
the
edges
to
fish
for
when
the
tide
comes
in
there
is
an
imposing
monument
in
the
to
the
great
man
and
his
amiable
consort
i
am
sure
that
if
there
were
any
surviving
relatives
of
the
governor
they
would
receive
in
deephaven
far
more
deference
than
is
consistent
with
the
principles
of
a
republican
government
but
the
family
became
extinct
long
since
and
i
have
heard
though
it
is
not
a
subject
that
one
may
speak
of
lightly
that
the
sons
were
unworthy
their
noble
descent
and
came
to
inglorious
ends
there
were
still
remaining
a
few
representatives
of
the
old
families
who
were
treated
with
much
reverence
by
the
rest
of
the
townspeople
although
they
were
like
the
conies
of
scripture
a
feeble
folk
deephaven
is
utterly
out
of
fashion
it
never
recovered
from
the
effects
of
the
embargo
of
and
a
has
been
steadily
filling
in
the
mouth
of
the
harbor
though
the
fishing
gives
what
occupation
there
is
for
the
inhabitants
of
the
place
it
is
by
no
means
sufficient
to
draw
recruits
from
abroad
but
nobody
in
deephaven
cares
for
excitement
and
if
some
one
once
in
a
while
has
the
low
taste
to
prefer
a
more
active
life
he
is
obliged
to
go
elsewhere
in
search
of
it
and
is
spoken
of
afterward
with
kind
pity
i
well
remember
the
widow
moses
said
to
me
in
speaking
of
a
certain
misguided
nephew
of
hers
i
never
could
see
what
could
sot
him
out
to
leave
so
many
privileges
and
go
way
off
to
lynn
with
all
them
children
too
why
they
lived
here
no
more
than
a
cable
length
from
the
there
were
two
schooners
owned
in
town
and
mauley
and
jo
sands
owned
a
trawl
there
were
some
schooners
and
a
small
brig
slowly
going
to
pieces
by
the
wharves
and
indeed
all
deephaven
looked
more
or
less
out
of
repair
all
along
shore
one
might
see
dories
and
wherries
and
which
had
been
left
to
die
a
lingering
death
there
is
something
piteous
to
me
in
the
sight
of
an
old
boat
if
one
i
had
used
much
and
cared
for
were
past
its
usefulness
i
should
say
good
by
to
it
and
have
it
towed
out
to
sea
and
sunk
it
never
should
be
left
to
fall
to
pieces
above
mark
even
the
commonest
fishermen
felt
a
satisfaction
and
seemed
to
realize
their
privilege
in
being
residents
of
deephaven
but
among
the
nobility
and
gentry
there
lingered
a
fierce
pride
in
their
family
and
town
records
and
a
hardly
concealed
contempt
and
pity
for
people
who
were
obliged
to
live
in
other
parts
of
the
world
there
were
acknowledged
to
be
a
few
disadvantages
such
as
living
nearly
a
dozen
miles
from
the
railway
but
as
miss
honora
carew
said
the
tone
of
deephaven
society
had
always
been
very
high
and
it
was
very
nice
that
there
had
never
been
any
manufacturing
element
introduced
she
could
not
feel
too
grateful
herself
that
there
was
no
disagreeable
foreign
population
but
said
kate
one
day
would
you
like
to
have
some
pleasant
new
people
brought
into
town
certainly
my
dear
said
miss
honora
rather
doubtfully
i
have
always
been
but
then
we
always
have
guests
in
summer
and
i
am
growing
old
i
should
not
care
to
enlarge
my
acquaintance
to
any
great
extent
miss
honora
and
dent
had
lived
gay
lives
in
their
younger
days
and
were
interested
and
connected
with
the
outside
world
more
than
any
of
our
deephaven
friends
but
they
were
quite
contented
to
stay
in
their
own
house
with
their
books
and
letters
and
knitting
and
they
carefully
read
littell
and
the
new
magazine
as
they
called
the
atlantic
the
carews
were
very
intimate
with
the
minister
and
his
sister
and
there
were
one
or
two
others
who
belonged
to
this
set
there
was
joshua
dorsey
who
wore
his
hair
in
a
queue
was
very
deaf
and
carried
a
ponderous
cane
which
had
belonged
to
his
venerated
father
a
much
taller
man
than
he
he
was
polite
to
kate
and
me
but
we
never
knew
him
much
he
went
to
play
whist
with
the
carews
every
monday
evening
and
commonly
went
out
fishing
once
a
week
he
had
begun
the
practice
of
law
but
he
had
lost
his
hearing
and
at
the
same
time
his
had
inconsiderately
fallen
in
love
with
somebody
else
after
which
he
retired
from
active
business
life
he
had
a
fine
library
which
he
invited
us
to
examine
he
had
many
new
books
but
they
looked
shockingly
overdressed
in
their
fresher
bindings
beside
the
old
brown
volumes
of
essays
and
sermons
and
lighter
works
in
editions
a
prominent
link
in
society
was
widow
tully
who
had
been
the
housekeeper
of
old
captain
manning
for
forty
years
when
he
died
he
left
her
the
use
of
his
house
and
family
pew
besides
an
annuity
the
existence
of
tully
seemed
to
be
a
myth
during
the
first
of
his
widow
residence
in
town
she
had
been
much
affected
when
obliged
to
speak
of
him
and
always
represented
herself
as
having
seen
better
days
and
as
being
highly
connected
but
she
was
apt
to
be
ungrammatical
when
excited
and
there
was
a
whispered
tradition
that
she
used
to
keep
a
in
a
town
in
connecticut
though
the
mystery
of
her
previous
state
of
existence
will
probably
never
be
solved
she
wore
mourning
for
the
captain
which
would
have
befitted
his
widow
and
patronized
the
townspeople
conspicuously
while
she
herself
was
treated
with
much
condescension
by
the
carews
and
lorimers
she
occupied
on
the
whole
much
the
same
position
that
betty
barker
did
in
cranford
and
indeed
kate
and
i
were
often
reminded
of
that
estimable
town
we
heard
that
kate
aunt
miss
brandon
had
never
been
appreciative
of
tully
merits
and
that
since
her
death
the
others
had
received
tully
into
their
society
rather
more
it
seemed
as
if
all
the
clocks
in
deephaven
and
all
the
people
with
them
had
stopped
years
ago
and
the
people
had
been
doing
over
and
over
what
they
had
been
busy
about
during
the
last
week
of
their
unambitious
progress
their
clothes
had
lasted
wonderfully
well
and
they
had
no
need
to
earn
money
when
there
was
so
little
chance
to
spend
it
indeed
there
were
several
families
who
seemed
to
have
no
more
visible
means
of
support
than
a
balloon
there
were
no
young
people
whom
we
knew
though
a
number
used
to
come
to
church
on
sunday
from
the
inland
farms
or
the
country
as
we
learned
to
say
there
were
children
among
the
fishermen
families
at
the
shore
but
a
few
years
will
see
deephaven
possessed
by
two
classes
instead
of
the
three
as
for
our
first
sunday
at
church
it
must
be
in
vain
to
ask
you
to
imagine
our
delight
when
we
heard
the
tuning
of
a
in
the
gallery
just
before
service
we
pressed
each
other
hands
most
tenderly
looked
up
at
the
singers
seats
and
then
trusted
ourselves
to
look
at
each
other
it
was
more
than
we
had
hoped
for
there
were
also
a
violin
and
sometimes
a
flute
and
a
choir
of
men
and
women
singers
though
the
congregation
were
expected
to
join
in
the
the
first
hymn
was
the
lord
our
god
is
full
of
might
the
winds
obey
his
will
to
the
tune
of
ann
it
was
all
so
delightfully
our
pew
was
a
square
pew
and
was
by
an
open
window
looking
seaward
we
also
had
a
view
of
the
entire
congregation
and
as
we
were
somewhat
early
we
watched
the
people
come
in
with
great
interest
the
deephaven
aristocracy
came
with
stately
step
up
the
aisle
this
was
all
the
chance
there
was
for
displaying
their
unquestioned
dignity
in
public
many
of
the
people
drove
to
church
in
wagons
that
were
low
and
old
and
creaky
with
worn
over
the
seat
and
some
hay
tucked
underneath
for
the
sleepy
undecided
old
horse
some
of
the
younger
farmers
and
their
wives
had
high
shiny
wagons
with
tall
horsewhips
which
they
sometimes
brought
into
church
and
they
drove
up
to
the
steps
with
a
consciousness
of
being
conspicuous
and
enviable
they
had
a
bashful
look
when
they
came
in
and
for
a
few
minutes
after
they
took
their
seats
they
evidently
felt
that
all
eyes
were
fixed
upon
them
but
after
a
little
while
they
were
quite
at
their
ease
and
looked
critically
at
the
new
arrivals
the
old
folks
interested
us
most
do
you
notice
how
many
more
old
women
there
are
than
old
men
whispered
kate
to
me
and
we
wondered
if
the
husbands
and
brothers
had
been
drowned
and
if
it
must
not
be
sad
to
look
at
the
blue
sunshiny
sea
beyond
the
marshes
if
the
white
sails
reminded
them
of
some
ships
that
had
never
sailed
home
into
deephaven
harbor
or
of
that
had
never
come
back
to
land
the
girls
and
young
men
adorned
themselves
in
what
they
believed
to
be
the
latest
fashion
but
the
elderly
women
were
usually
relics
of
old
times
in
manner
and
dress
they
wore
to
church
thin
soft
silk
gowns
that
must
have
been
brought
from
over
the
seas
years
upon
years
before
and
wide
collars
fastened
with
holding
a
lock
of
hair
they
had
big
black
bonnets
some
of
them
with
stiff
capes
such
as
kate
and
i
had
not
seen
before
since
our
childhood
they
treasured
large
rusty
lace
veils
of
scraggly
pattern
and
wore
sometimes
on
pleasant
sundays
white
shawls
with
attenuated
fringes
and
there
were
two
or
three
of
these
shawls
in
the
congregation
which
had
been
dyed
black
and
gave
an
aspect
of
meekness
and
general
unworthiness
to
the
aged
wearer
they
clung
and
drooped
about
the
figure
in
such
a
hopeless
way
we
used
to
notice
often
the
most
interesting
scarfs
without
which
no
deephaven
woman
considered
herself
in
full
dress
sometimes
there
were
red
india
scarfs
in
spite
of
its
being
hot
weather
but
our
favorite
ones
were
long
strips
of
silk
embroidered
along
the
edges
and
at
the
ends
with
floss
in
odd
patterns
i
think
there
must
have
been
a
fashion
once
in
deephaven
of
working
these
scarfs
and
i
should
not
be
surprised
to
find
that
it
was
many
years
before
the
fashion
of
working
samplers
came
about
our
friends
always
wore
black
mitts
on
warm
sundays
and
many
of
them
carried
neat
little
bags
of
various
designs
on
their
arms
containing
a
precisely
folded
and
a
frugal
lunch
of
caraway
seeds
or
red
and
white
peppermints
i
should
like
you
to
see
with
your
own
eyes
widow
ware
and
miss
hull
two
old
sisters
whose
personal
appearance
we
delighted
in
and
whom
we
saw
feebly
approaching
down
the
street
this
first
sunday
morning
under
the
shadow
of
the
two
last
members
of
an
otherwise
extinct
race
of
parasols
there
were
two
or
three
old
men
who
sat
near
us
they
were
sailors
there
is
something
unmistakable
about
a
sailor
and
they
had
a
curiously
ancient
uncanny
look
as
if
they
might
have
belonged
to
the
crew
of
the
mayflower
or
even
have
cruised
about
with
the
northmen
in
the
times
of
harold
harfager
and
his
comrades
they
had
been
blown
about
by
so
many
winter
winds
so
browned
by
summer
suns
and
wet
by
salt
spray
that
their
hands
and
faces
looked
like
leather
with
a
few
deep
folds
instead
of
wrinkles
they
had
pale
blue
eyes
very
keen
and
quick
their
hair
looked
like
the
fine
which
clings
to
the
and
in
little
locks
these
friends
of
ours
sat
solemnly
at
the
heads
of
their
pews
and
looked
unflinchingly
at
the
minister
when
they
were
not
dozing
and
they
sang
with
voices
like
the
howl
of
the
wind
with
an
occasional
deep
note
or
two
have
you
never
seen
faces
that
seemed
many
of
the
people
in
deephaven
church
looked
as
if
they
must
be
if
not
supernaturally
old
exact
copies
of
their
remote
ancestors
i
wonder
if
it
is
not
possible
that
the
features
and
expression
may
be
almost
perfectly
reproduced
these
faces
were
not
modern
american
faces
but
belonged
rather
to
the
days
of
the
early
settlement
of
the
country
the
old
colonial
times
we
often
heard
quaint
words
and
expressions
which
we
never
had
known
anywhere
else
but
in
old
books
there
was
a
great
deal
of
in
use
indeed
we
learned
a
great
deal
ourselves
unconsciously
and
used
it
afterward
to
the
great
amusement
of
our
friends
but
there
were
also
many
peculiar
provincialisms
and
among
the
people
who
lived
on
the
lonely
farms
inland
we
often
noticed
words
we
had
seen
in
chaucer
and
studied
out
at
school
in
our
english
literature
class
everything
in
deephaven
was
more
or
less
influenced
by
the
sea
the
minister
spoke
oftenest
of
peter
and
his
fishermen
companions
and
prayed
most
earnestly
every
sunday
morning
for
those
who
go
down
to
the
sea
in
ships
he
made
frequent
allusions
and
drew
numberless
illustrations
of
a
similar
kind
for
his
sermons
and
indeed
i
am
in
doubt
whether
if
the
bible
had
been
written
wholly
in
inland
countries
it
would
have
been
much
valued
in
deephaven
the
singing
was
very
droll
for
there
was
a
majority
of
old
voices
which
had
seen
their
best
days
long
before
and
the
was
excessively
noticeable
and
apt
to
be
a
little
ahead
of
the
time
the
singers
kept
while
the
violin
lingered
after
somewhere
on
the
other
side
of
the
church
we
heard
an
acute
voice
which
rose
high
above
all
the
rest
of
the
congregation
sharp
as
a
needle
and
slightly
cracked
with
a
limitless
supply
of
breath
it
rose
and
fell
gallantly
and
clung
long
to
the
high
notes
of
dundee
it
was
like
the
wail
of
the
banshee
which
sounds
clear
to
the
fated
hearer
above
all
other
noises
we
afterward
became
acquainted
with
the
owner
of
this
voice
and
were
surprised
to
find
her
a
meek
widow
who
was
like
a
thin
black
beetle
in
her
pathetic
cypress
veil
and
big
black
bonnet
she
looked
as
if
she
had
forgotten
who
she
was
and
spoke
with
an
apologetic
whine
but
we
heard
she
had
a
temper
as
high
as
her
voice
and
as
much
to
be
dreaded
as
the
equinoctial
gale
near
the
church
was
the
parsonage
where
lorimer
lived
and
the
old
lorimer
house
not
far
beyond
was
occupied
by
miss
rebecca
lorimer
some
stranger
might
ask
the
question
why
the
minister
and
his
sister
did
not
live
together
but
you
would
have
understood
it
at
once
after
you
had
lived
for
a
little
while
in
town
they
were
very
fond
of
each
other
and
the
minister
dined
with
miss
rebecca
on
sundays
and
she
passed
the
day
with
him
on
wednesdays
and
they
ruled
their
separate
households
with
decision
and
dignity
i
think
lorimer
house
showed
no
signs
of
being
without
a
mistress
any
more
than
his
sister
betrayed
the
want
of
a
master
care
and
authority
the
carews
were
very
kind
friends
of
ours
and
had
been
miss
best
friends
we
heard
that
there
had
always
been
a
coolness
between
miss
brandon
and
miss
lorimer
and
that
though
they
exchanged
visits
and
were
always
polite
there
was
a
chill
in
the
politeness
and
one
would
never
have
suspected
them
of
admiring
each
other
at
all
we
had
the
whole
history
of
the
trouble
which
dated
back
scores
of
years
from
miss
honora
carew
but
we
always
took
pains
to
appear
ignorant
of
the
feud
and
i
think
miss
lorimer
was
satisfied
that
it
was
best
not
to
refer
to
it
and
to
let
bygones
be
bygones
it
would
not
have
been
true
deephaven
courtesy
to
prejudice
kate
against
her
and
miss
rebecca
cherished
her
dislike
in
silence
which
gave
us
a
most
grand
respect
for
her
since
we
knew
she
thought
herself
in
the
right
though
i
think
it
never
had
come
to
an
open
quarrel
between
these
majestic
aristocrats
miss
honora
carew
and
dick
and
their
elder
sister
dent
had
a
charmingly
sedate
and
quiet
home
in
the
old
carew
house
dent
was
ill
a
great
deal
while
we
were
there
but
she
must
have
been
a
very
brilliant
woman
and
was
not
at
all
dull
when
we
knew
her
she
had
outlived
her
husband
and
her
children
and
she
had
several
years
before
our
summer
there
given
up
her
own
home
which
was
in
the
city
and
had
come
back
to
deephaven
miss
honora
dear
miss
honora
had
been
one
of
the
brightest
happiest
girls
and
had
lost
none
of
her
brightness
and
happiness
by
growing
old
she
had
lost
none
of
her
fondness
for
society
though
she
was
so
contented
in
quiet
deephaven
and
i
think
she
enjoyed
kate
and
my
stories
of
our
pleasures
as
much
as
we
did
hers
of
old
times
we
used
to
go
to
see
her
almost
every
day
dick
as
they
called
their
brother
had
once
been
a
merchant
in
the
east
indies
and
there
were
quantities
of
curiosities
and
most
beautiful
china
which
he
had
brought
and
sent
home
which
gave
the
house
a
character
of
its
own
he
had
been
very
rich
and
had
lost
some
of
his
money
and
then
he
came
home
and
was
still
considered
to
possess
princely
wealth
by
his
neighbors
he
had
a
great
fondness
for
reading
and
study
which
had
not
been
lost
sight
of
during
his
business
life
and
he
spent
most
of
his
time
in
his
library
he
and
lorimer
had
their
differences
of
opinion
about
certain
points
of
theology
and
this
made
them
much
fonder
of
each
other
society
and
gave
them
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
for
after
every
series
of
arguments
each
was
sure
that
he
had
vanquished
the
other
or
there
were
alternate
victories
and
defeats
which
made
life
vastly
interesting
and
important
miss
carew
and
dent
had
a
great
treasury
of
old
brocades
and
laces
and
ornaments
which
they
showed
us
one
day
and
told
us
stories
of
the
wearers
or
if
they
were
their
own
there
were
always
some
reminiscences
which
they
liked
to
talk
over
with
each
other
and
with
us
i
never
shall
forget
the
first
evening
we
took
tea
with
them
it
impressed
us
very
much
and
yet
nothing
wonderful
happened
tea
was
handed
round
by
an
maid
and
afterward
we
sat
talking
in
the
twilight
looking
out
at
the
garden
it
was
such
a
delight
to
have
tea
served
in
this
way
i
wonder
that
the
fashion
has
been
almost
forgotten
kate
and
i
took
much
pleasure
in
choosing
our
hers
had
a
mandarin
parading
on
the
top
and
mine
a
flight
of
birds
and
a
pagoda
and
we
often
used
them
afterward
for
miss
honora
asked
us
to
come
to
tea
whenever
we
liked
a
stupid
common
country
town
some
one
dared
to
call
deephaven
in
a
letter
once
and
how
bitterly
we
resented
it
that
was
a
house
where
one
might
find
the
best
society
and
the
most
charming
manners
and
and
if
i
were
asked
to
tell
you
what
i
mean
by
the
word
lady
i
should
ask
you
to
go
if
it
were
possible
to
call
upon
miss
honora
carew
after
a
while
the
elder
sister
said
my
dears
we
always
have
prayers
at
nine
for
i
have
to
go
up
stairs
early
nowadays
and
then
the
servants
came
in
and
she
read
solemnly
the
king
of
glory
psalm
which
i
have
always
liked
best
and
then
dick
read
the
church
prayers
the
form
of
prayer
to
be
used
in
families
we
stayed
later
to
talk
with
miss
honora
after
we
had
said
good
night
to
dent
and
we
told
each
other
as
we
went
home
in
the
moonlight
down
the
quiet
street
how
much
we
had
enjoyed
the
evening
for
somehow
the
house
and
the
people
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
present
or
the
hurry
of
modern
life
i
have
never
heard
that
psalm
since
without
its
bringing
back
that
summer
night
in
deephaven
the
beautiful
quaint
old
room
and
kate
and
i
feeling
so
young
and
worldly
by
contrast
the
flickering
shaded
light
of
the
candles
the
old
book
and
the
voices
that
said
amen
there
were
several
other
fine
old
houses
in
deephaven
beside
this
and
the
brandon
house
though
that
was
rather
the
most
imposing
there
were
two
or
three
which
had
not
been
kept
in
repair
and
were
deserted
and
of
course
they
were
said
to
be
haunted
and
we
were
told
of
their
ghosts
and
why
they
walked
and
when
from
some
of
the
local
superstitions
kate
and
i
have
vainly
endeavored
ever
since
to
shake
ourselves
free
there
was
a
most
heathenish
fear
of
doing
certain
things
on
friday
and
there
were
countless
signs
in
which
we
still
have
confidence
when
the
moon
is
very
bright
and
other
people
grow
sentimental
we
only
remember
that
it
is
a
fine
night
to
catch
hake
i
should
consider
my
account
of
deephaven
society
incomplete
if
i
did
not
tell
you
something
of
the
ancient
mariners
who
may
be
found
every
pleasant
morning
sunning
themselves
like
turtles
on
one
of
the
wharves
sometimes
there
was
a
considerable
group
of
them
but
the
less
constant
members
of
the
club
were
older
than
the
rest
and
the
epidemics
of
rheumatism
in
town
were
sadly
frequent
we
found
that
it
was
etiquette
to
call
them
each
captain
but
i
think
some
of
the
deephaven
men
took
the
title
by
brevet
upon
arriving
at
a
proper
age
they
sat
close
together
because
so
many
of
them
were
deaf
and
when
we
were
lucky
enough
to
overhear
the
conversation
it
seemed
to
concern
their
adventures
at
sea
or
the
freight
carried
out
by
the
sea
duck
the
ocean
rover
or
some
other
deephaven
ship
the
particulars
of
the
voyage
and
its
disasters
and
successes
being
as
familiar
as
the
wanderings
of
the
children
of
israel
to
an
old
parson
there
were
sometimes
violent
altercations
when
the
captains
differed
as
to
the
tonnage
of
some
craft
that
had
been
a
prey
to
the
winds
and
waves
or
barnacles
fifty
years
before
the
old
fellows
puffed
away
at
little
black
pipes
with
short
stems
and
otherwise
consumed
tobacco
in
fabulous
quantities
it
is
needless
to
say
that
they
gave
an
immense
deal
of
attention
to
the
weather
we
used
to
wish
we
could
join
this
agreeable
company
but
we
found
that
the
appearance
of
an
outsider
caused
a
disapproving
silence
and
that
the
meeting
was
evidently
not
to
be
interfered
with
once
we
were
impertinent
enough
to
hide
ourselves
for
a
while
just
round
the
corner
of
the
warehouse
but
we
were
afraid
or
ashamed
to
try
it
again
though
the
conversation
was
inconceivably
edifying
captain
isaac
horn
the
eldest
and
wisest
of
all
was
discoursing
upon
some
cloth
he
had
purchased
once
in
bristol
which
the
shopkeeper
delayed
sending
until
just
as
they
were
ready
to
weigh
anchor
i
happened
to
take
a
look
at
that
cloth
said
the
captain
in
a
loud
droning
voice
and
as
quick
as
i
got
sight
of
it
i
spoke
onpleasant
of
that
swindling
english
fellow
and
the
crew
they
stood
back
i
was
dreadful
in
them
days
mind
ye
and
i
had
the
gig
manned
we
was
out
in
the
stream
just
ready
to
sail
was
no
use
waiting
any
longer
for
the
wind
to
change
and
we
was
going
i
went
ashore
and
when
i
walks
into
his
shop
ye
never
see
a
creatur
so
wilted
ye
see
the
sculpin
thought
i
never
stop
to
open
the
goods
an
it
was
a
chance
i
did
mind
ye
says
he
grinning
and
turning
the
color
of
a
biled
lobster
ye
were
a
standing
out
to
sea
by
this
time
says
i
i
got
my
men
out
here
on
the
quay
a
landing
that
cloth
o
yourn
and
if
you
do
send
just
what
i
bought
and
paid
for
down
there
to
go
back
in
the
gig
within
fifteen
minutes
i
take
ye
by
the
collar
and
drop
ye
into
the
dock
i
was
twice
the
size
of
him
mind
ye
and
master
strong
ye
like
it
says
he
edging
round
change
it
for
ye
then
perlite
he
was
it
says
i
looks
as
if
it
were
built
of
dog
hair
and
divil
wool
kicked
together
by
spiders
and
it
coarser
than
irish
frieze
three
threads
to
an
says
i
this
was
evidently
one
of
the
captain
favorite
stories
for
we
heard
an
approving
grumble
from
the
audience
in
the
course
of
a
walk
inland
we
made
a
new
acquaintance
captain
lant
whom
we
had
noticed
at
church
and
who
sometimes
joined
the
company
on
the
wharf
we
had
been
walking
through
the
woods
and
coming
out
to
his
fields
we
went
on
to
the
house
for
some
water
there
was
no
one
at
home
but
the
captain
who
told
us
cheerfully
that
he
should
be
pleased
to
serve
us
though
his
had
gone
off
to
a
funeral
the
other
side
of
the
he
brought
out
a
pitcherful
of
milk
and
after
we
had
drunk
some
we
all
sat
down
together
in
the
shade
the
captain
brought
an
old
chair
from
the
woodhouse
and
sat
down
facing
kate
and
me
with
an
air
of
certainty
that
he
was
going
to
hear
something
new
and
make
some
desirable
new
acquaintances
and
also
that
he
could
tell
something
it
would
be
worth
our
while
to
hear
he
looked
more
and
more
like
a
old
english
sparrow
and
chippered
faster
and
faster
queer
ye
should
know
i
a
sailor
so
quick
why
i
been
it
this
twenty
years
have
to
go
down
to
the
shore
and
take
a
fishing
every
hand
turn
though
to
keep
the
old
hulk
clear
of
barnacles
there
i
do
wish
i
lived
nigher
the
shore
where
i
could
see
the
folks
i
know
and
talk
about
what
been
on
you
do
know
anything
about
it
you
do
but
it
tryin
to
a
man
to
be
called
lant
and
so
to
speak
be
forgot
when
there
anything
stirring
and
be
called
by
clumsy
creatur
goin
on
fifty
and
sixty
who
ca
do
no
more
work
than
i
can
an
then
the
keeps
me
to
be
keerful
and
not
fall
and
as
how
i
too
old
to
go
out
fishing
and
when
they
want
to
be
they
say
as
how
they
do
see
as
i
fail
and
how
wonderful
i
keep
my
hearin
i
never
did
want
to
farm
it
but
always
took
it
to
heart
when
i
was
off
on
a
and
this
farm
and
some
means
beside
come
to
her
from
her
brother
and
they
all
sot
to
and
give
me
no
peace
of
mind
till
i
sold
out
my
share
of
the
ann
eliza
and
come
ashore
for
good
i
did
keep
an
eighth
of
the
pactolus
and
i
was
ship
husband
for
a
long
spell
but
she
never
was
heard
from
on
her
last
voyage
to
singapore
i
was
the
lonesomest
man
when
i
first
come
ashore
that
ever
you
see
well
you
are
master
hands
to
walk
if
you
come
way
up
from
the
brandon
house
i
wish
the
women
was
at
home
know
miss
brandon
why
yes
and
i
remember
all
her
brothers
and
sisters
and
her
father
and
mother
i
can
see
now
coming
into
meeting
proud
as
lucifer
and
straight
as
a
mast
every
one
of
miss
katharine
she
always
had
her
butter
from
this
very
farm
some
of
the
folks
used
to
go
down
every
saturday
and
my
wife
she
been
in
the
house
a
hundred
times
i
so
you
are
hathaway
brandon
to
kate
why
he
and
i
have
been
out
fishing
together
many
the
time
he
and
chantrey
his
next
younger
brother
henry
he
was
a
he
went
to
furrin
parts
and
turned
out
a
catholic
priest
i
you
heard
i
never
was
so
set
henry
as
some
folks
was
he
was
the
pleasantest
spoken
of
the
whole
on
you
do
look
like
the
brandons
you
really
favor
well
i
pleased
to
see
ye
i
sure
we
asked
him
many
questions
about
the
old
people
and
found
he
knew
all
the
family
histories
and
told
them
with
great
satisfaction
we
found
he
had
his
pet
stories
and
it
must
have
been
gratifying
to
have
an
entirely
new
and
fresh
audience
he
was
adroit
in
leading
the
conversation
around
to
a
point
where
the
stories
would
come
in
appropriately
and
we
helped
him
as
much
as
possible
in
a
small
neighborhood
all
the
people
know
each
other
stories
and
experiences
by
heart
and
i
have
no
doubt
the
old
captain
had
been
snubbed
many
times
on
beginning
a
favorite
anecdote
there
was
a
story
which
he
told
us
that
first
day
which
he
assured
us
was
strictly
true
and
it
is
certainly
a
remarkable
instance
of
the
influence
of
one
mind
upon
another
at
a
distance
it
seems
to
me
worth
preserving
at
any
rate
and
as
we
heard
it
from
the
old
man
with
his
solemn
voice
and
serious
expression
and
quaint
gestures
it
was
singularly
impressive
when
i
was
a
youngster
said
captain
lant
i
was
an
orphan
and
i
was
bound
out
to
old
peletiah
daw
folks
over
on
the
ridge
road
it
was
in
the
time
of
the
last
war
and
he
had
a
nephew
ben
dighton
a
dreadful
wild
fellow
who
had
gone
off
on
a
privateer
the
old
man
he
set
everything
by
ben
he
would
disoblige
his
own
boys
any
day
to
please
him
this
was
in
his
latter
days
and
he
used
to
have
spells
of
wandering
and
being
out
of
his
head
and
he
used
to
call
for
ben
and
talk
sort
of
foolish
about
him
till
they
would
tell
him
to
stop
ben
never
did
a
stroke
of
work
for
him
either
but
he
was
a
handsome
fellow
and
had
a
way
with
him
when
he
was
one
night
old
peletiah
had
been
very
bad
all
day
and
was
getting
quieted
down
and
it
was
after
supper
we
sat
round
in
the
kitchen
and
he
lay
in
the
bedroom
opening
out
there
were
some
blazing
and
the
light
shone
in
on
the
bed
and
all
of
a
sudden
something
made
me
look
up
and
look
in
and
there
was
the
old
man
setting
up
straight
with
his
eyes
shining
at
me
like
a
cat
says
he
and
his
two
sons
run
in
then
to
catch
hold
of
him
for
they
thought
he
was
beginning
with
one
of
his
wild
spells
but
he
fell
back
on
the
bed
and
began
to
cry
like
a
baby
dear
me
says
he
hung
him
hung
him
right
up
to
the
o
they
ought
to
have
done
it
cut
him
down
quick
he
did
think
he
means
well
ben
does
he
was
hasty
o
my
god
i
ca
bear
to
see
him
swing
round
by
the
neck
poor
ben
hung
up
to
the
let
me
alone
i
say
andrew
and
moses
they
were
holding
him
with
all
their
might
and
they
were
both
hearty
men
but
he
got
away
from
them
once
or
twice
and
he
screeched
and
howled
like
a
mad
creatur
and
then
he
would
cry
again
like
a
child
he
was
worn
out
after
a
while
and
lay
back
quiet
and
said
over
and
over
ben
and
at
the
and
he
told
the
neighbors
next
day
but
nobody
noticed
him
much
and
he
seemed
to
forget
it
as
his
mind
come
back
all
that
summer
he
was
and
towards
cold
weather
he
failed
right
along
though
he
had
been
a
master
strong
man
in
his
day
and
his
timbers
held
together
well
along
late
in
the
fall
he
had
taken
to
his
bed
and
one
day
there
came
to
the
house
a
fellow
named
sim
decker
a
reckless
fellow
he
was
too
who
had
gone
out
in
the
same
ship
with
ben
he
pulled
a
long
face
when
he
came
in
and
said
he
had
brought
bad
news
they
had
been
taken
prisoner
and
carried
into
port
and
put
in
jail
and
ben
dighton
had
got
a
fever
there
and
died
lie
says
the
old
man
from
the
bedroom
speaking
as
loud
and
as
ever
you
heard
hung
him
to
the
mind
him
says
andrew
and
he
had
a
bad
dream
along
back
in
the
spring
i
he
forgotten
it
but
the
decker
fellow
he
turned
pale
and
kept
talking
crooked
while
he
listened
to
old
peletiah
to
himself
he
answered
the
questions
the
asked
him
they
took
on
a
good
deal
but
pretty
soon
he
got
up
and
winked
to
me
and
andrew
and
we
went
out
in
the
yard
he
began
to
swear
and
then
says
he
did
the
old
man
have
his
dream
andrew
could
remember
but
i
knew
it
was
the
night
before
he
sold
the
gray
colt
and
that
was
the
of
april
says
sim
decker
the
day
of
april
ben
dighton
was
hung
to
the
and
i
see
do
it
lord
help
him
i
mean
to
tell
the
women
and
i
you
never
know
for
i
all
the
one
of
the
ship
company
you
ever
likely
to
see
we
were
taken
prisoner
and
ben
was
mad
as
fire
and
they
were
scared
of
him
and
chained
him
to
the
deck
and
while
he
was
sulking
there
a
little
parrot
of
a
midshipman
come
up
and
grinned
at
him
and
snapped
his
fingers
in
his
face
and
ben
lifted
his
hands
with
the
heavy
irons
and
sprung
at
him
like
a
tiger
and
the
boy
dropped
dead
as
a
stone
and
they
put
the
bight
of
a
rope
round
ben
neck
and
slung
him
right
up
to
the
and
there
he
swung
back
and
forth
until
as
soon
as
we
dared
one
of
us
clim
up
and
cut
the
rope
and
let
him
go
over
the
side
and
they
put
us
in
irons
for
that
curse
how
did
that
old
man
in
there
know
and
he
bedridden
here
nigh
upon
three
thousand
miles
off
says
he
but
i
guess
there
was
any
of
us
could
tell
him
said
captain
lant
in
conclusion
it
something
i
never
could
account
for
but
it
true
as
truth
i
known
more
such
cases
some
folks
laughs
at
me
for
believing
yarns
they
calls
but
if
you
notice
everybody
got
some
yarn
of
that
kind
they
do
believe
if
they
wo
believe
yours
and
there
a
good
deal
happens
in
the
world
that
now
there
was
widder
oliver
pinkham
over
to
the
told
me
with
her
own
lips
that
she
but
just
here
we
saw
the
captain
expression
alter
suddenly
and
looked
around
to
see
a
wagon
coming
up
the
lane
we
immediately
said
we
must
go
home
for
it
was
growing
late
but
asked
permission
to
come
again
and
hear
the
widow
oliver
pinkham
story
we
stopped
however
to
see
the
and
afterward
became
so
intimate
with
them
that
we
were
invited
to
spend
the
afternoon
and
take
tea
which
invitation
we
accepted
with
great
pride
we
went
out
fishing
also
with
the
captain
and
danny
of
whom
i
will
tell
you
presently
i
often
think
of
captain
lant
in
the
winter
for
he
told
kate
once
that
he
felt
master
old
in
winter
to
what
he
did
in
summer
he
likes
reading
fortunately
and
we
had
a
letter
from
him
not
long
ago
acknowledging
the
receipt
of
some
books
of
travel
by
land
and
water
which
we
had
luckily
thought
to
send
him
he
gave
the
latitude
and
longitude
of
deephaven
at
the
beginning
of
his
letter
and
signed
himself
respectfully
yours
with
esteem
jacob
lant
condemned
as
unseaworthy
deephaven
seemed
more
like
one
of
the
lazy
little
english
seaside
towns
than
any
other
it
was
not
in
the
least
american
there
was
no
excitement
about
anything
there
were
no
manufactories
nobody
seemed
in
the
least
hurry
the
only
foreigners
were
a
few
stranded
sailors
i
do
not
know
when
a
house
or
a
new
building
of
any
kind
had
been
built
the
men
were
farmers
or
went
outward
in
boats
or
inward
in
or
sometimes
mackerel
and
halibut
fishing
in
schooners
for
the
city
markets
sometimes
a
schooner
came
to
one
of
the
wharves
to
load
with
hay
or
firewood
but
deephaven
used
to
be
a
town
of
note
rich
and
busy
as
its
forsaken
warehouses
show
we
knew
almost
all
the
at
the
shore
even
old
dinnett
who
lived
an
apparently
desolate
life
by
himself
in
a
hut
and
was
reputed
to
have
been
a
bloodthirsty
pirate
in
his
youth
he
was
consequently
feared
by
all
the
children
and
for
misdemeanors
in
his
latter
days
avoided
generally
kate
talked
with
him
awhile
one
day
on
the
shore
and
made
him
come
up
with
her
for
a
bandage
for
his
hand
which
she
saw
he
had
hurt
badly
and
the
next
morning
he
brought
us
a
new
lobster
apiece
fishermen
mean
that
a
thing
is
only
not
salted
when
they
say
it
is
fresh
we
happened
to
be
in
the
hall
and
received
him
ourselves
and
gave
him
a
great
piece
of
tobacco
and
unintentionally
the
means
of
drinking
our
health
bless
your
pretty
hearts
said
he
may
ye
be
happy
and
live
long
and
get
good
husbands
and
if
they
ai
good
to
you
may
they
die
from
you
none
of
our
friends
were
more
interesting
than
the
fishermen
the
which
might
be
called
the
business
centre
of
the
town
were
at
a
little
distance
from
the
old
warehouses
farther
down
the
harbor
shore
and
were
ready
to
fall
down
in
despair
there
were
some
fishermen
who
lived
near
by
but
most
of
them
were
also
farmers
in
a
small
way
and
lived
in
the
village
or
farther
inland
from
our
eastern
windows
we
could
see
the
moorings
and
we
always
liked
to
watch
the
boats
go
out
or
come
straying
in
one
after
the
other
ripping
and
skimming
under
the
square
little
sails
and
we
often
went
down
to
the
to
see
what
kind
of
a
catch
there
had
been
i
should
have
imagined
that
the
sea
would
become
very
commonplace
to
men
whose
business
was
carried
on
in
boats
and
who
had
spent
night
after
night
and
day
after
day
from
their
boyhood
on
the
water
but
that
is
a
mistake
they
have
an
awe
of
the
sea
and
of
its
mysteries
and
of
what
it
hides
away
from
us
they
are
childish
in
their
wonder
at
any
strange
creature
which
they
find
if
they
have
not
seen
the
they
believe
i
am
sure
that
other
people
have
and
when
a
great
shark
or
or
was
taken
and
brought
in
shore
everybody
went
to
see
it
and
we
talked
about
it
and
how
brave
its
conqueror
was
and
what
a
fight
there
had
been
for
a
long
time
afterward
i
said
that
we
liked
to
see
the
boats
go
out
but
i
must
not
give
you
the
impression
that
we
saw
them
often
for
they
weighed
anchor
at
an
early
hour
in
the
morning
i
remember
once
there
was
a
light
fog
over
the
sea
lifting
fast
as
the
sun
was
coming
up
and
the
brownish
sails
disappeared
in
the
mist
while
voices
could
still
be
heard
for
some
minutes
after
the
men
were
hidden
from
sight
this
gave
one
a
curious
feeling
but
afterward
when
the
sun
had
risen
everything
looked
much
the
same
as
usual
the
fog
had
gone
and
the
dories
and
even
the
larger
boats
were
distant
specks
on
the
sparkling
sea
one
afternoon
we
made
a
new
acquaintance
in
this
wise
we
went
down
to
the
shore
to
see
if
we
could
hire
a
conveyance
to
the
lighthouse
the
next
morning
we
often
went
out
early
in
one
of
the
and
after
we
had
stayed
as
long
as
we
pleased
kew
would
bring
us
home
it
was
quiet
enough
that
day
for
not
a
single
boat
had
come
in
and
there
were
no
men
to
be
seen
there
was
a
solemn
company
of
or
cages
which
had
been
brought
in
to
be
mended
they
always
amused
kate
she
said
they
seemed
to
her
like
droll
old
women
telling
each
other
secrets
these
were
scattered
about
in
different
attitudes
and
looked
more
confidential
than
usual
just
as
we
were
going
away
we
happened
to
see
a
man
at
work
in
one
of
the
sheds
he
was
the
fisherman
whom
we
knew
least
of
all
an
silent
sort
of
man
more
sunburnt
and
than
any
of
the
others
we
had
learned
to
know
him
by
the
bright
red
flannel
shirt
he
always
wore
and
besides
he
was
lame
some
one
told
us
he
had
had
a
bad
fall
once
on
board
ship
kate
and
i
had
always
wished
we
could
find
a
chance
to
talk
with
him
he
looked
up
at
us
pleasantly
and
when
we
nodded
and
smiled
he
said
good
day
in
a
gruff
hearty
voice
and
went
on
with
his
work
cleaning
mackerel
do
you
mind
our
watching
you
asked
kate
no
said
the
fisherman
emphatically
so
there
we
stood
those
were
curious
places
so
different
from
any
other
kind
of
workshop
in
this
there
was
a
seine
or
part
of
one
festooned
among
the
overhead
and
there
were
snarled
and
barrows
to
carry
fish
in
like
wheelbarrows
without
wheels
there
were
the
queer
round
and
kits
of
salt
mackerel
tubs
of
bait
and
piles
of
clams
and
some
queer
bones
and
parts
of
remarkable
fish
and
of
surprising
size
fastened
on
the
walls
for
ornament
there
was
a
pile
of
rubbish
down
at
the
end
i
dare
say
it
was
all
useful
however
there
is
such
mystery
about
the
business
kate
and
i
were
never
tired
of
hearing
of
the
fish
that
come
at
different
times
of
the
year
and
go
away
again
like
the
birds
or
of
the
actions
of
the
which
the
hate
so
bitterly
and
then
there
are
such
curious
legends
and
traditions
of
which
almost
all
fishermen
have
a
store
i
think
mackerel
are
the
prettiest
fish
that
swim
said
i
presently
so
do
i
miss
said
the
man
not
to
say
but
i
seen
more
fish
down
in
southern
waters
bright
as
any
flower
you
ever
see
but
a
mackerel
holding
up
one
admiringly
why
they
so
and
put
a
cod
alongside
and
he
looks
as
lumbering
as
an
dutch
brig
aside
a
yacht
those
are
fish
but
they
a
made
much
account
of
continued
our
friend
as
he
pushed
aside
the
mackerel
and
took
another
tub
they
hake
i
you
know
but
i
forgot
i
ca
stop
to
bother
with
them
now
and
he
pulled
forward
a
barrow
full
of
small
fish
flat
and
hard
with
pointed
bony
heads
those
are
porgies
are
they
asked
kate
yes
said
the
man
an
i
going
to
sliver
them
for
the
trawls
we
knew
what
the
trawls
were
and
supposed
that
the
porgies
were
to
be
used
for
bait
and
we
soon
found
out
what
slivering
meant
by
seeing
him
take
them
by
the
head
and
cut
a
slice
from
first
one
side
and
then
the
other
in
such
a
way
that
the
pieces
looked
not
unlike
smaller
fish
it
seems
to
me
said
i
that
fishermen
always
have
sharper
knives
than
other
people
yes
we
do
like
a
sharp
knife
in
our
trade
and
then
we
are
mostly
he
was
throwing
the
porgies
heads
and
backbones
all
that
was
left
of
them
after
slivering
in
a
heap
and
now
several
cats
walked
in
as
if
they
felt
at
home
and
began
a
hearty
lunch
what
a
troop
of
pussies
there
is
round
here
said
i
i
wonder
what
will
become
of
them
in
the
winter
though
to
be
sure
the
fishing
goes
on
just
the
same
the
better
part
of
them
do
get
through
the
cold
weather
said
danny
two
or
three
of
the
old
ones
have
been
here
for
years
and
are
as
much
belonging
to
deephaven
as
the
but
the
rest
of
them
a
to
be
depended
on
you
miss
the
young
ones
by
the
dozen
come
spring
i
do
know
myself
but
they
move
inland
in
the
fall
of
the
year
they
knowing
enough
if
that
all
kate
and
i
stood
in
the
wide
doorway
arm
in
arm
looking
sometimes
at
the
queer
fisherman
and
the
porgies
and
sometimes
out
to
sea
it
was
low
tide
the
wind
had
risen
a
little
and
the
heavy
salt
air
blew
toward
us
from
the
wet
brown
ledges
in
the
rocky
harbor
the
sea
was
bright
blue
and
the
sun
was
shining
two
gulls
were
swinging
lazily
to
and
fro
there
was
a
flock
of
down
by
the
water
edge
in
a
great
hurry
as
usual
presently
the
fisherman
spoke
again
beginning
with
an
odd
laugh
i
scared
last
winter
jack
scudder
and
me
we
were
up
in
the
manning
storehouse
hunting
for
a
of
salt
the
skipper
said
was
there
it
was
an
awful
blustering
kind
of
day
with
a
thin
icy
rain
blowing
from
all
points
at
once
sea
roaring
as
if
it
wished
it
could
come
ashore
and
put
a
stop
to
everything
bad
days
at
sea
them
are
rigging
all
froze
up
as
i
was
saying
we
were
hunting
for
a
of
salt
and
i
laid
hold
of
a
that
had
something
heavy
in
the
bottom
and
tilted
it
up
and
my
eye
there
was
a
stir
and
a
scratch
and
a
squeal
and
out
went
some
kind
of
a
creatur
and
i
jumped
back
not
looking
for
anything
live
but
i
see
in
a
minute
it
was
a
cat
and
perhaps
you
think
it
is
a
big
story
but
there
were
eight
more
in
there
hived
in
together
to
keep
warm
i
car
up
some
new
fish
that
night
they
seemed
short
of
provisions
we
had
been
out
fishing
as
much
as
common
and
they
had
dared
to
be
round
the
much
for
a
fellow
who
came
in
on
a
coaster
had
a
dog
and
he
used
to
chase
hard
chance
they
had
and
lots
of
died
i
guess
but
there
seem
to
be
some
survivin
relatives
an
just
so
hungry
i
used
to
feed
them
some
when
i
was
ashore
i
think
likely
you
heard
that
a
cat
will
fetch
you
bad
luck
but
i
do
know
that
made
much
difference
to
me
i
kind
of
like
to
keep
on
the
right
side
of
too
if
ever
i
have
a
bad
dream
there
sure
to
be
a
cat
in
it
but
i
was
brought
up
to
be
clever
to
dumb
beasts
an
i
guess
it
my
natur
except
fish
said
danny
after
a
minute
thought
but
then
it
never
seems
like
they
had
feelin
like
creatur
that
live
ashore
and
we
all
laughed
heartily
and
felt
well
acquainted
i
you
misses
will
laugh
if
i
tell
ye
i
kept
a
kitty
once
myself
this
was
said
rather
shyly
and
there
was
evidently
a
story
so
we
were
much
interested
and
kate
said
please
tell
us
about
it
was
it
at
sea
yes
it
was
at
sea
leastways
on
a
coaster
i
got
her
in
a
kind
of
way
it
was
one
afternoon
we
were
lying
alongside
charlestown
bridge
and
i
heard
a
young
cat
screeching
real
pitiful
and
after
i
looked
all
round
i
see
her
in
the
water
clutching
on
to
the
pier
of
the
bridge
and
some
little
divils
of
boys
were
heaving
rocks
down
at
her
i
got
into
the
schooner
quick
i
tell
ye
and
pushed
off
for
her
she
let
go
just
as
i
got
there
i
guess
you
never
saw
a
more
creatur
than
i
fished
out
of
the
water
cold
weather
it
was
her
leg
was
hurt
and
her
eye
and
i
thought
first
drop
her
overboard
again
and
then
i
did
and
i
took
her
aboard
the
schooner
and
put
her
by
the
stove
i
thought
she
might
as
well
die
where
it
was
warm
she
eat
a
little
mite
of
chowder
before
night
but
she
was
very
slim
but
next
morning
when
i
went
to
see
if
she
was
dead
she
fell
to
licking
my
finger
and
she
did
purr
away
like
a
dolphin
one
of
her
eyes
was
out
where
a
stone
had
took
her
and
she
never
got
any
use
of
it
but
she
used
to
look
at
you
so
clever
with
the
other
and
she
got
well
of
her
lame
foot
after
a
while
i
got
to
be
fond
of
her
she
was
just
the
knowingest
thing
you
ever
saw
and
she
used
to
sleep
alongside
of
me
in
my
bunk
and
like
as
not
she
would
go
on
deck
with
me
when
it
was
my
watch
i
was
coasting
then
for
a
year
and
eight
months
and
i
kept
her
all
the
time
we
used
to
be
in
harbor
and
about
eight
in
the
forenoon
i
used
to
drop
a
line
and
catch
her
a
couple
of
cunners
now
it
is
that
she
used
to
know
when
i
was
fishing
for
her
she
would
pounce
on
them
fish
and
carry
them
off
and
growl
and
she
knew
when
i
got
a
bite
she
watch
the
line
but
when
we
were
mackereling
she
never
give
us
any
trouble
she
would
never
lift
a
paw
to
touch
any
of
our
fish
she
did
have
the
thieving
ways
common
to
most
cats
she
used
to
set
round
on
deck
in
fair
weather
and
when
the
wind
blew
she
kept
herself
below
sometimes
when
we
were
in
port
she
would
go
ashore
awhile
and
fetch
back
a
bird
or
a
mouse
but
she
would
eat
it
till
she
come
and
showed
it
to
me
she
never
wanted
to
stop
long
ashore
though
i
never
shut
her
up
i
always
give
her
her
liberty
i
got
a
good
deal
of
joking
about
her
from
the
fellows
but
she
was
a
sight
of
company
i
don
know
as
i
ever
had
anything
like
me
as
much
as
she
did
not
to
say
as
i
ever
had
much
of
any
trouble
with
anybody
ashore
or
afloat
i
a
still
kind
of
fellow
for
all
i
look
so
rough
but
then
i
ha
had
a
home
what
i
call
a
home
since
i
was
going
on
nine
year
old
how
has
that
happened
asked
kate
well
mother
she
died
and
i
was
bound
out
to
a
man
in
the
tanning
trade
and
i
hated
him
and
i
hated
the
trade
and
when
i
was
a
little
bigger
i
ran
away
and
i
followed
the
sea
ever
since
i
was
much
use
to
him
i
guess
leastways
he
never
took
the
trouble
to
hunt
me
up
about
the
best
place
i
ever
was
in
was
a
hospital
it
was
in
foreign
parts
ye
see
i
crippled
some
i
fell
from
the
topsail
yard
to
the
deck
and
i
struck
my
shoulder
and
broke
my
leg
and
banged
myself
all
up
it
was
to
a
nuns
hospital
where
they
took
me
all
of
the
nuns
were
catholics
and
they
wore
big
white
things
on
their
heads
i
suppose
you
ever
saw
any
have
you
well
now
that
queer
when
i
was
first
there
i
was
scared
of
them
they
were
real
ladies
and
i
used
to
being
in
a
house
any
way
one
of
them
that
took
care
of
me
most
of
the
time
why
she
would
even
set
up
half
the
night
with
me
and
i
could
begin
to
tell
you
how
she
was
an
she
look
real
sorry
too
i
used
to
be
ugly
i
ached
so
along
in
the
first
of
my
being
there
but
i
spoke
of
it
when
i
was
coming
away
and
she
said
it
was
all
right
she
used
to
feed
me
that
lady
did
and
there
were
some
days
i
could
lift
my
head
and
she
would
rise
it
on
her
arm
she
give
me
a
little
mite
of
a
book
when
i
come
away
i
not
much
of
a
hand
at
reading
but
i
always
kept
it
on
account
of
her
she
was
so
pleased
when
i
got
so
to
set
up
in
a
chair
and
look
out
of
the
window
she
much
of
a
hand
to
talk
english
i
did
feel
bad
to
come
away
from
there
i
wished
i
could
be
sick
a
while
longer
i
never
said
much
of
anything
either
and
i
do
know
but
she
thought
it
was
queer
but
i
am
a
dreadful
clumsy
man
to
say
anything
and
i
got
flustered
i
know
i
mind
telling
you
i
was
i
used
to
think
i
lay
by
some
money
and
ship
for
there
and
carry
her
something
real
pretty
but
i
do
rank
seaman
like
i
used
and
it
as
much
as
i
can
do
to
get
a
berth
on
a
coaster
i
suppose
i
might
go
as
cook
i
liked
to
have
died
with
my
hurt
at
that
hospital
but
when
i
was
getting
well
it
made
me
think
of
when
i
was
a
mite
of
a
chap
to
home
before
mother
died
to
be
laying
there
in
a
clean
bed
with
somebody
to
do
for
me
guess
you
think
i
a
good
hand
to
spin
long
yarns
somehow
it
comes
easy
to
talk
what
became
of
your
cat
asked
kate
after
a
pause
during
which
our
friend
sliced
away
at
the
porgies
i
never
rightfully
knew
it
was
in
salem
harbor
and
a
windy
night
i
was
on
deck
for
the
schooner
pitched
lively
and
once
or
twice
she
dragged
her
anchor
i
never
saw
the
kitty
after
she
eat
her
supper
i
remember
i
gave
her
some
milk
i
used
to
buy
her
a
pint
once
in
a
while
for
a
treat
i
do
know
but
she
might
have
gone
off
on
a
cake
of
ice
but
it
did
seem
as
if
she
had
too
much
sense
for
that
most
likely
she
missed
her
footing
and
fell
overboard
in
the
dark
she
was
marked
real
pretty
black
and
white
and
kep
herself
just
as
clean
she
knew
as
well
as
could
be
when
foul
weather
was
coming
she
would
bother
round
and
act
queer
but
when
the
sun
was
out
she
would
sit
round
on
deck
as
pleased
as
a
queen
there
i
feel
bad
sometimes
when
i
think
of
her
and
i
never
went
into
salem
since
without
hoping
that
i
should
see
her
i
do
know
but
if
i
was
to
begin
my
life
over
again
settle
down
ashore
and
have
a
snug
little
house
and
farm
it
but
i
guess
i
shall
do
better
at
fishing
give
me
a
topsail
schooner
painted
up
nice
with
a
stripe
on
her
and
clean
sails
and
a
fresh
wind
with
the
sun
and
i
feel
do
you
believe
that
codfish
swallow
stones
before
a
storm
asked
kate
i
had
been
thinking
about
the
lonely
fisherman
in
a
sentimental
way
and
so
irrelevant
a
question
shocked
me
i
saw
he
felt
slightly
embarrassed
at
having
talked
about
his
affairs
so
much
kate
told
me
afterward
and
i
thought
we
should
leave
him
feeling
more
at
his
ease
if
we
talked
about
fish
for
a
while
and
sure
enough
he
did
seem
relieved
and
gave
us
his
opinion
about
the
codfish
at
once
adding
that
he
never
cared
much
for
cod
any
way
folks
up
country
bought
a
good
deal
he
heard
give
him
a
haddock
right
out
of
the
water
for
his
dinner
i
never
can
remember
said
kate
whether
it
is
cod
or
haddock
that
have
a
black
stripe
along
their
sides
o
those
are
haddock
said
i
they
say
that
the
devil
caught
a
haddock
once
and
it
slipped
through
his
fingers
and
got
scorched
so
all
the
haddock
had
the
same
mark
afterward
well
now
how
did
you
know
that
old
story
said
danny
laughing
heartily
ye
must
believe
all
the
old
stories
ye
hear
mind
ye
o
no
said
we
hullo
there
jim
toggerson
boat
close
in
shore
she
sets
low
in
the
water
so
he
done
well
he
and
skipper
scudder
have
been
out
fishing
since
yesterday
our
friend
pushed
the
porgies
back
into
a
corner
stuck
his
knife
into
a
beam
and
we
hurried
down
to
the
shore
kate
and
i
sat
on
the
pebbles
and
he
went
out
to
the
moorings
in
a
dirty
dory
to
help
unload
the
fish
we
afterward
saw
a
great
deal
of
danny
as
all
the
men
called
him
but
though
kate
and
i
tried
our
best
and
used
our
utmost
skill
and
tact
to
make
him
tell
us
more
about
himself
he
never
did
but
perhaps
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
told
the
day
we
left
deephaven
we
went
down
to
the
shore
to
say
good
by
to
him
and
to
some
other
friends
and
he
said
goin
are
ye
well
sorry
ye
treated
me
the
lord
bless
ye
and
then
was
so
much
mortified
at
the
way
he
had
said
farewell
that
he
turned
and
fled
round
the
corner
of
the
old
captain
sands
was
one
of
the
most
prominent
citizens
of
deephaven
and
a
very
good
friend
of
kate
and
mine
we
often
met
him
and
grew
much
interested
in
him
before
we
knew
him
well
he
had
a
reputation
in
town
for
being
peculiar
and
somewhat
visionary
but
every
one
seemed
to
like
him
and
at
last
one
morning
when
we
happened
to
be
on
our
way
to
the
wharves
we
stopped
at
the
door
of
an
old
warehouse
which
we
had
never
seen
opened
before
captain
sands
sat
just
inside
smoking
his
pipe
and
we
said
good
morning
and
asked
him
if
he
did
not
think
there
was
a
fog
coming
in
by
and
by
we
had
thought
a
little
of
going
out
to
the
lighthouse
the
rose
slowly
and
came
out
so
that
he
could
see
farther
round
to
the
east
there
some
scud
coming
in
said
he
none
to
speak
of
yet
i
do
know
you
can
see
it
yes
right
there
a
heavy
bank
of
fog
lyin
off
but
it
wo
be
in
under
two
or
three
hours
yet
unless
the
wind
backs
round
more
and
freshens
up
were
thinking
of
going
out
were
ye
a
little
said
kate
but
we
had
nearly
given
it
up
we
are
getting
to
be
very
and
we
pride
ourselves
on
being
quick
at
seeing
fogs
at
which
the
smiled
and
said
we
were
young
to
know
much
about
weather
but
it
looked
well
that
we
took
some
interest
in
it
most
young
people
were
fools
about
weather
and
would
just
as
soon
set
off
to
go
anywhere
right
under
the
edge
of
a
come
in
and
set
down
wo
ye
he
added
it
ai
much
of
a
place
i
got
a
lot
of
old
stuff
stowed
away
here
that
the
want
up
to
the
house
i
a
great
hand
for
keeping
things
and
he
looked
round
fondly
at
the
contents
of
the
wide
low
room
i
come
down
here
once
in
a
while
and
let
in
the
sun
and
sometimes
i
want
to
hunt
up
something
or
kind
of
place
ye
see
and
then
he
laughed
apologetically
rubbing
his
hands
together
and
looking
out
to
sea
again
as
if
he
wished
to
appear
unconcerned
yet
we
saw
that
he
wondered
if
we
thought
it
ridiculous
for
a
man
of
his
age
to
have
treasured
up
so
much
trumpery
in
that
cobwebby
place
there
were
some
whole
oars
and
the
sail
of
his
boat
and
two
or
three
killicks
and
painters
not
to
forget
a
heap
of
oars
and
sails
in
one
corner
and
a
sailor
hammock
slung
across
the
beam
overhead
and
there
were
some
sailor
chests
and
the
capstan
of
a
ship
and
innumerable
boxes
which
all
seemed
to
be
stuffed
full
besides
no
end
of
things
lying
on
the
floor
and
packed
away
on
shelves
and
hanging
to
rusty
nails
in
the
wall
i
saw
some
great
lumps
of
coral
and
large
rough
shells
a
great
hornet
nest
and
a
monstrous
the
had
cobbled
and
tied
up
some
remarkable
old
chairs
for
the
accommodation
of
himself
and
his
friends
what
a
nice
place
said
kate
in
a
frank
delighted
way
which
could
not
have
failed
to
be
gratifying
well
no
said
the
with
his
slow
smile
it
ai
what
rightly
call
as
i
know
of
it
ai
never
been
cleared
out
all
at
once
since
i
began
putting
in
there
nothing
that
worth
anything
either
to
anybody
but
me
wife
she
said
to
me
a
hundred
times
do
you
overhaul
them
old
things
and
burn
she
at
me
about
letting
the
property
as
if
it
were
a
in
broadway
that
all
know
about
business
and
here
the
captain
caught
himself
tripping
and
looked
uneasy
for
a
minute
i
suppose
i
might
have
let
it
for
a
but
it
most
too
far
from
the
shore
to
be
handy
and
well
there
are
some
things
here
that
i
set
a
good
deal
by
is
that
a
sword
in
that
piece
of
wood
kate
asked
presently
and
was
answered
that
it
was
found
broken
off
as
we
saw
it
in
the
hull
of
a
wreck
that
went
ashore
on
blue
when
the
captain
was
a
young
man
and
he
had
sawed
it
out
and
kept
it
ever
since
years
of
course
we
went
closer
to
look
at
it
and
we
both
felt
a
great
sympathy
for
this
friend
of
ours
because
we
have
the
same
fashion
of
keeping
worthless
treasures
and
we
understood
perfectly
how
dear
such
things
may
be
do
you
mind
if
we
look
round
a
little
i
asked
doubtfully
for
i
knew
how
i
should
hate
having
strangers
look
over
my
own
treasury
but
captain
sands
looked
pleased
at
our
interest
and
said
cheerfully
that
we
might
overhaul
as
much
as
we
chose
kate
discovered
first
an
old
battered
wooden
of
a
ship
a
woman
head
with
long
curly
hair
falling
over
the
shoulders
the
paint
was
almost
gone
and
the
dust
covered
most
of
what
was
left
still
there
was
a
wonderful
spirit
and
grace
and
a
wild
weird
beauty
which
attracted
us
exceedingly
but
the
captain
could
only
tell
us
that
it
had
belonged
to
the
wreck
of
a
danish
brig
which
had
been
driven
on
the
reef
where
the
lighthouse
stands
now
and
his
father
had
found
this
on
the
long
sands
a
day
or
two
afterward
that
was
a
dreadful
storm
said
the
captain
i
heard
the
old
folks
tell
about
it
it
was
when
i
was
only
a
year
or
two
old
there
were
three
merchantmen
wrecked
within
five
miles
of
deephaven
this
one
was
all
stove
to
splinters
and
they
used
to
say
she
had
treasure
aboard
when
i
was
small
i
used
to
have
a
great
idea
of
going
out
there
to
the
rocks
at
low
water
and
trying
to
find
some
gold
but
i
never
made
out
no
great
and
he
smiled
indulgently
at
the
thought
of
his
youthful
dream
kate
said
i
do
you
see
what
beauties
these
knots
are
we
had
been
taking
a
course
of
first
lessons
in
knots
from
danny
and
had
followed
by
learning
some
charmingly
intricate
ones
from
captain
lant
the
stranded
mariner
who
lived
on
a
farm
two
miles
or
so
inland
kate
came
over
to
look
at
the
which
were
at
either
end
of
the
rope
handles
of
a
little
chest
captain
sands
turned
in
his
chair
and
nodded
approval
that
a
neat
piece
of
work
and
it
was
a
seaman
who
did
it
he
dead
and
gone
years
ago
poor
young
fellow
an
he
was
who
sailed
on
the
ranger
three
or
four
long
voyages
he
fell
from
the
on
the
voyage
home
from
callao
manning
and
old
lorimer
they
owned
the
ranger
and
when
she
come
into
port
and
they
got
the
news
they
took
it
as
much
to
heart
as
if
he
been
some
relation
he
was
smart
as
a
whip
and
had
a
way
with
him
and
the
pleasantest
kind
of
a
voice
you
could
help
liking
him
they
found
out
that
he
had
a
mother
alive
in
port
mahon
and
they
sent
his
pay
and
some
money
he
had
in
the
bank
at
riverport
out
to
her
by
a
ship
that
was
going
to
the
mediterranean
he
had
some
clothes
in
his
chest
and
they
sold
those
and
sent
her
the
money
all
but
some
trinkets
they
supposed
he
was
keeping
for
her
i
he
used
to
speak
about
his
mother
i
shipped
one
with
him
before
the
mast
before
i
went
out
mate
of
the
daylight
i
happened
to
be
in
port
the
time
the
ranger
got
in
an
i
see
this
chist
lying
round
in
manning
storehouse
and
i
offered
to
give
him
what
it
was
worth
but
we
was
good
friends
and
he
told
me
take
it
if
i
wanted
it
it
was
no
use
to
him
and
i
kept
it
ever
since
there
are
some
of
his
traps
in
it
now
i
believe
ye
can
look
and
we
took
off
some
tangled
and
opened
the
chest
there
was
only
a
round
wooden
box
in
the
till
and
in
some
idle
hour
at
sea
the
young
sailor
had
carved
his
initials
and
an
anchor
and
the
date
on
the
cover
we
found
some
and
a
palm
in
this
kit
as
the
sailors
call
it
and
a
little
string
of
buttons
with
some
needles
and
yarn
and
thread
in
a
neat
little
bag
which
perhaps
his
mother
had
made
for
him
when
he
started
off
on
his
first
voyage
besides
these
things
there
was
only
a
fanciful
little
broken
buckle
green
and
gilt
which
he
might
have
picked
up
in
some
foreign
street
and
his
carefully
folded
wherein
he
was
certified
as
being
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
with
dark
complexion
and
dark
hair
he
was
one
of
the
pleasantest
fellows
that
ever
i
shipped
with
said
the
captain
with
a
gruff
tenderness
in
his
voice
always
willin
to
do
his
work
himself
and
like
not
when
the
other
fellows
up
the
rigging
were
cold
or
ugly
about
something
or
he
say
something
that
would
set
them
all
laughing
and
somehow
it
made
you
to
see
him
round
he
was
brought
up
a
catholic
i
anyway
he
had
some
beads
and
sometimes
they
would
joke
him
about
on
board
ship
but
he
would
blaze
up
in
a
minute
ugly
as
a
tiger
i
never
saw
him
mad
about
anything
else
though
he
would
stand
it
if
anybody
tried
to
crowd
him
he
fell
from
the
yard
to
the
deck
and
was
dead
when
they
picked
him
up
they
were
off
the
bermudas
i
suppose
he
lost
his
balance
but
i
never
could
see
how
he
was
and
as
quick
as
a
cat
they
said
they
saw
him
try
to
catch
at
the
stay
but
there
was
a
heavy
sea
running
and
the
ship
rolled
just
so
to
let
him
through
between
the
rigging
and
he
struck
the
deck
like
a
stone
i
know
that
chest
has
been
opened
these
ten
years
i
declare
it
carries
me
back
to
look
at
those
poor
little
traps
of
his
well
it
the
way
of
the
world
we
think
we
somebody
and
we
have
our
day
but
it
long
afore
we
forgotten
the
captain
reached
over
for
the
paper
and
taking
out
a
clumsy
pair
of
spectacles
read
it
through
carefully
i
warrant
he
took
good
care
of
this
said
he
he
was
an
and
no
more
of
an
american
citizen
than
a
chinese
i
wonder
he
had
called
himself
john
jones
that
the
name
most
of
the
foreigners
used
to
take
when
they
got
their
papers
i
remember
once
i
was
sick
with
a
fever
in
chelsea
hospital
and
one
morning
they
came
bringing
in
the
mate
of
a
portugee
brig
on
a
stretcher
and
the
surgeon
asked
what
his
name
was
jones
says
he
say
something
else
says
the
surgeon
got
five
john
joneses
here
and
it
getting
to
be
no
name
at
all
sailors
are
great
hands
for
false
names
they
have
a
trick
of
using
them
when
they
have
any
money
to
leave
ashore
for
fear
their
shipmates
will
go
and
draw
it
out
i
suppose
there
are
thousands
of
dollars
unclaimed
in
new
york
banks
where
men
have
left
it
charged
to
their
false
names
then
they
get
lost
at
sea
or
something
and
never
go
to
get
it
and
nobody
knows
whose
it
is
they
curious
folks
take
altogether
sailors
is
specially
these
foreign
fellows
that
wander
about
from
ship
to
ship
they
getting
to
be
a
dreadful
low
set
too
of
late
years
it
the
last
thing
i
want
a
boy
of
mine
to
do
ship
before
the
mast
with
one
of
these
mixed
crews
it
a
dog
life
anyway
and
the
risks
and
the
chances
against
you
are
awful
it
a
good
while
before
you
can
lay
up
anything
unless
you
are
part
owner
i
saw
all
the
a
good
deal
plainer
after
i
quit
followin
the
sea
myself
though
i
always
been
more
or
less
into
navigation
until
this
last
war
come
on
i
know
when
i
was
ship
husband
of
the
polly
and
susan
there
was
a
young
man
went
out
of
her
her
last
voyage
and
she
never
was
heard
from
he
had
a
wife
and
two
or
three
little
children
and
for
all
he
was
so
smart
they
would
have
been
about
the
same
as
beggars
if
i
happened
to
have
his
life
insured
the
day
i
was
having
the
papers
made
out
for
the
ship
i
happened
to
think
of
it
five
thousand
dollars
there
was
and
i
sent
it
to
the
widow
along
with
his
primage
she
expected
nothing
or
next
to
nothing
and
she
was
pleased
i
tell
ye
i
think
it
was
very
kind
in
you
to
think
of
that
captain
sands
said
kate
and
the
old
man
said
flushing
a
little
well
i
not
so
smart
as
some
of
the
men
who
started
when
i
did
and
some
of
went
ahead
of
me
but
some
of
did
after
all
i
tried
to
be
honest
and
to
do
just
about
as
nigh
right
as
i
could
and
you
know
there
an
old
sayin
that
a
cripple
in
the
right
road
will
beat
a
racer
in
the
wrong
circus
at
kate
and
i
looked
forward
to
a
certain
saturday
with
as
much
eagerness
as
if
we
had
been
little
for
on
that
day
we
were
to
go
to
a
circus
at
denby
a
town
perhaps
eight
miles
inland
there
had
not
been
a
circus
so
near
deephaven
for
a
long
time
and
nobody
had
dared
to
believe
the
first
rumor
of
it
until
two
dashing
young
men
had
deigned
to
come
themselves
to
put
up
the
big
posters
on
the
end
of
mauley
barn
all
the
boys
in
town
came
as
soon
as
possible
to
see
these
amazing
pictures
and
some
were
wretched
in
their
secret
hearts
at
the
thought
that
they
might
not
see
the
show
itself
tommy
dockum
was
more
interested
than
any
one
else
and
mentioned
the
subject
so
frequently
one
day
when
he
went
blackberrying
with
us
that
we
grew
enthusiastic
and
told
each
other
what
fun
it
would
be
to
go
for
everybody
would
be
there
and
it
would
be
the
greatest
loss
to
us
if
we
were
absent
i
thought
i
had
lost
my
childish
fondness
for
circuses
but
it
came
back
redoubled
and
kate
may
contradict
me
if
she
chooses
but
i
am
sure
she
never
looked
forward
to
the
easter
oratorio
with
half
the
pleasure
she
did
to
this
caravan
as
most
of
the
people
called
it
we
felt
that
it
was
a
great
pity
that
any
of
the
boys
and
girls
should
be
left
lamenting
at
home
and
finding
that
there
were
some
of
our
acquaintances
and
tommy
who
saw
no
chance
of
going
we
engaged
jo
sands
and
leander
dockum
to
carry
them
to
denby
in
two
with
boards
laid
across
for
the
extra
seats
we
saw
them
join
the
straggling
train
of
carriages
which
had
begun
to
go
through
the
village
from
all
along
shore
soon
after
daylight
and
they
started
on
their
journey
shouting
and
carousing
with
their
pockets
crammed
with
early
apples
and
other
provisions
we
thought
it
would
have
been
fun
enough
to
see
the
people
go
by
for
we
had
had
no
idea
until
then
how
many
inhabitants
that
country
held
we
had
asked
kew
to
go
with
us
but
she
was
half
an
hour
later
than
she
had
promised
for
since
there
was
no
wind
she
could
not
come
ashore
in
the
and
kew
had
had
to
row
her
in
in
the
dory
we
saw
the
boat
at
last
nearly
in
shore
and
drove
down
to
meet
it
even
the
horse
seemed
to
realize
what
a
great
day
it
was
and
showed
a
disposition
to
friskiness
evidently
as
surprising
to
himself
as
to
us
kew
was
funnier
that
day
than
we
had
ever
known
her
which
is
saying
a
great
deal
and
we
should
not
have
had
half
so
good
a
time
if
she
had
not
been
with
us
although
she
lived
in
the
lighthouse
and
had
no
chance
to
see
passing
which
a
woman
prizes
so
highly
in
the
country
she
had
a
wonderful
memory
for
faces
and
could
tell
us
the
names
of
all
deephaveners
and
of
most
of
the
people
we
met
outside
its
limits
she
looked
impressed
and
solemn
as
she
hurried
up
from
the
water
edge
giving
kew
some
parting
charges
over
her
shoulder
as
he
pushed
off
the
boat
to
go
back
but
after
we
had
convinced
her
that
the
delay
had
not
troubled
us
she
seemed
more
cheerful
it
was
evident
that
she
felt
the
importance
of
the
occasion
and
that
she
was
pleased
at
our
having
chosen
her
for
company
she
threw
back
her
veil
entirely
sat
very
straight
and
took
immense
pains
to
bow
to
every
acquaintance
whom
she
met
she
wore
her
best
sunday
clothes
and
her
manner
was
formal
for
the
first
few
minutes
it
was
evident
that
she
felt
we
were
meeting
under
unusual
circumstances
and
that
although
we
had
often
met
before
on
the
friendliest
terms
our
having
asked
her
to
make
this
excursion
in
public
required
a
different
sort
of
behavior
at
her
hands
and
a
due
amount
of
ceremony
and
propriety
but
this
state
of
things
did
not
last
long
as
she
soon
made
a
remark
at
which
kate
and
i
laughed
so
heartily
in
fashion
that
she
unbent
and
gave
her
whole
mind
to
enjoying
herself
when
we
came
by
the
store
where
the
was
kept
we
saw
a
small
knot
of
people
gathered
round
the
door
and
stopped
to
see
what
had
happened
there
was
a
forlorn
horse
standing
near
with
his
harness
tied
up
with
fuzzy
ends
of
rope
and
the
wagon
was
cobbled
together
with
pieces
of
board
the
whole
craft
looked
as
if
it
might
be
wrecked
with
the
least
jar
in
the
wagon
were
four
or
five
boys
and
girls
one
of
whom
was
crying
softly
their
father
was
sick
some
one
told
us
he
was
took
faint
but
he
is
coming
to
all
right
they
have
give
him
something
to
take
their
name
is
craper
and
they
live
way
over
beyond
the
ridge
on
stone
hill
they
were
goin
over
to
denby
to
the
circus
and
the
man
was
to
get
doctored
but
i
d
know
he
can
get
so
fur
he
powerful
to
me
kate
and
i
went
to
see
if
we
could
be
of
any
use
and
when
we
went
into
the
store
we
saw
the
man
leaning
back
in
his
chair
looking
ghastly
pale
and
as
if
he
were
far
gone
in
consumption
kate
spoke
to
him
and
he
said
he
was
better
he
had
felt
bad
all
the
way
along
but
he
had
given
up
he
was
pitiful
poor
fellow
with
his
evident
attempt
at
dressing
up
he
had
the
bushiest
dustiest
red
hair
and
whiskers
which
made
the
pallor
of
his
face
still
more
striking
and
his
illness
had
thinned
and
paled
his
rough
clumsy
hands
i
thought
what
a
hard
piece
of
work
it
must
have
been
for
him
to
start
for
the
circus
that
morning
and
how
he
must
be
to
have
made
such
an
effort
for
his
pleasure
as
we
went
out
they
stared
at
us
gloomily
the
shadow
of
their
disappointment
touched
and
chilled
our
pleasure
somebody
had
turned
the
horse
so
that
he
was
heading
toward
home
and
by
his
actions
he
showed
that
he
was
the
only
one
of
the
party
who
was
glad
we
were
so
sorry
for
the
children
perhaps
it
had
promised
to
be
the
happiest
day
of
their
lives
and
now
they
must
go
back
to
their
uninteresting
home
without
having
seen
the
great
show
i
am
so
sorry
you
are
disappointed
said
kate
as
we
were
wondering
how
the
man
who
had
followed
us
could
ever
climb
into
the
wagon
heh
said
he
blankly
as
if
he
did
not
know
what
her
words
meant
what
fool
has
been
a
turning
o
this
horse
he
asked
a
man
who
was
looking
on
why
which
way
be
ye
goin
to
the
circus
said
craper
with
decision
where
d
that
where
i
started
for
anyways
and
he
climbed
in
and
glanced
round
to
count
the
children
struck
the
horse
with
the
willow
switch
and
they
started
off
briskly
while
everybody
laughed
kate
and
i
joined
kew
who
had
enjoyed
the
scene
well
there
said
she
i
wonder
the
folks
in
the
old
north
ai
up
to
go
to
denby
to
that
caravan
we
reached
denby
at
noon
it
was
an
uninteresting
town
which
had
grown
up
around
some
mills
there
was
a
great
commotion
in
the
streets
and
it
was
evident
that
we
had
lost
much
in
not
having
seen
the
procession
there
was
a
great
deal
of
business
going
on
in
the
shops
and
there
were
two
or
three
at
large
near
one
of
which
we
stopped
awhile
to
listen
just
after
we
had
met
leander
and
given
the
horse
into
his
charge
kew
finished
her
shopping
as
soon
as
possible
and
we
hurried
toward
the
great
tents
where
all
the
flags
were
flying
i
think
i
have
not
told
you
that
we
were
to
have
the
benefit
of
seeing
a
menagerie
in
addition
to
the
circus
and
you
may
be
sure
we
went
faithfully
round
to
see
everything
that
the
cages
held
i
can
not
truthfully
say
that
it
was
a
good
show
it
was
somewhat
dreary
now
that
i
think
of
it
quietly
and
without
excitement
the
creatures
looked
tired
and
as
if
they
had
been
on
the
road
for
a
great
many
years
the
animals
were
all
old
and
there
was
a
shabby
great
elephant
whose
look
of
general
discouragement
went
to
my
heart
for
it
seemed
as
if
he
were
miserably
conscious
of
a
misspent
life
he
stood
dejected
and
motionless
at
one
side
of
the
tent
and
it
was
hard
to
believe
that
there
was
a
spark
of
vitality
left
in
him
a
great
number
of
the
people
had
never
seen
an
elephant
before
and
we
heard
a
thin
little
old
man
who
stood
near
us
say
delightedly
there
the
old
creatur
and
no
mistake
ann
i
wanted
to
see
him
most
of
anything
my
sakes
alive
ai
he
big
and
ann
who
was
stout
and
droned
out
there
of
him
but
he
looks
as
if
he
ai
got
no
animation
kate
and
i
turned
away
and
laughed
while
kew
said
confidentially
as
the
couple
moved
away
need
be
a
reflectin
on
the
poor
beast
that
mis
seth
tanner
and
there
is
a
woman
in
deephaven
nor
east
parish
to
be
named
the
same
day
with
her
for
laziness
i
glad
she
did
catch
sight
of
me
she
have
talked
about
nothing
for
a
fortnight
there
was
a
picture
of
a
huge
snake
in
deephaven
and
i
was
just
wondering
where
he
could
be
or
if
there
ever
had
been
one
when
we
heard
a
boy
ask
the
same
question
of
the
man
whose
thankless
task
it
was
to
stir
up
the
lions
with
a
stick
to
make
them
roar
the
snake
dead
he
answered
did
you
have
to
dig
an
awful
long
grave
for
him
asked
the
boy
but
the
man
said
he
reckoned
they
curled
him
up
some
and
smiled
as
he
turned
to
his
lions
who
looked
as
if
they
needed
a
tonic
everybody
lingered
longest
before
the
monkeys
who
seemed
to
be
the
only
lively
creatures
in
the
whole
collection
and
finally
we
made
our
way
into
the
other
tent
and
perched
ourselves
on
a
high
seat
from
whence
we
had
a
capital
view
of
the
audience
and
the
ring
and
could
see
the
people
come
in
kew
was
on
the
lookout
for
acquaintances
and
her
spirits
as
well
as
our
own
seemed
to
rise
higher
and
higher
she
was
on
the
alert
moving
her
head
this
way
and
that
to
catch
sight
of
people
giving
us
a
running
commentary
in
the
mean
time
it
was
very
pleasant
to
see
a
person
so
happy
as
kew
was
that
day
and
i
dare
say
in
speaking
of
the
occasion
she
would
say
the
same
thing
of
kate
and
me
for
it
was
such
a
good
time
we
bought
some
peanuts
without
which
no
circus
seems
complete
and
we
listened
to
the
conversations
which
were
being
carried
on
around
us
while
we
were
waiting
for
the
performance
to
begin
there
were
two
old
farmers
whom
we
had
noticed
occasionally
in
deephaven
one
was
telling
the
other
with
great
confusion
of
pronouns
about
a
big
pig
which
had
lately
been
killed
john
did
feel
dreadful
disappointed
at
having
to
kill
now
we
heard
him
say
bein
as
he
had
to
kill
along
near
time
there
was
goin
to
be
a
new
moon
then
and
he
expected
to
get
or
a
hundred
pound
more
on
to
him
but
he
did
seem
to
gain
and
me
and
both
told
him
he
be
better
to
kill
now
while
everything
was
and
if
he
set
out
to
wait
something
might
happen
to
him
and
then
i
always
held
that
you
ca
get
no
hog
only
just
so
fur
and
for
my
part
i
do
like
these
great
overgrown
creatur
i
like
well
enough
to
see
a
hog
that
weigh
six
hunderd
just
for
the
beauty
o
but
for
my
eatin
give
me
one
that
just
rise
three
accurate
and
he
says
he
is
goin
to
weigh
five
hundred
and
fifty
i
shall
stop
as
i
go
home
to
john
brother
and
see
if
they
got
the
particulars
yet
john
was
goin
to
get
the
scales
this
morning
i
guess
likely
many
gather
there
after
meeting
john
did
to
cut
up
till
monday
i
guess
likely
i
stop
in
said
the
other
man
i
like
to
see
a
hog
chester
white
you
said
consider
them
best
ye
but
this
question
never
was
answered
for
the
greater
part
of
the
circus
company
in
gorgeous
trappings
came
parading
in
the
circus
was
like
all
other
circuses
except
that
it
was
shabbier
than
most
and
the
performers
seemed
to
have
less
heart
in
it
than
usual
they
did
their
best
and
went
through
with
their
parts
conscientiously
but
they
looked
as
if
they
never
had
had
a
good
time
in
their
lives
the
audience
was
hilarious
and
cheered
and
laughed
at
the
tired
clown
until
he
looked
as
if
he
thought
his
speeches
might
possibly
be
funny
after
all
we
were
so
glad
we
had
pleased
the
poor
thing
and
when
he
sang
a
song
our
satisfaction
was
still
greater
and
so
he
sang
it
all
over
again
perhaps
he
had
been
associating
with
people
who
were
used
to
circuses
the
afternoon
was
hot
and
the
boys
with
japanese
fans
and
trays
of
lemonade
did
a
remarkable
business
for
so
late
in
the
season
the
brass
band
on
the
other
side
of
the
tent
shrieked
its
very
best
and
all
the
young
men
of
the
region
had
brought
their
girls
and
some
of
these
countless
pairs
of
country
lovers
we
watched
a
great
deal
as
they
kept
company
with
more
or
less
depth
of
satisfaction
in
each
other
we
had
a
grand
chance
to
see
the
fashions
and
there
were
many
old
people
and
a
great
number
of
little
children
and
some
families
had
evidently
locked
their
house
door
behind
them
since
they
had
brought
both
the
dog
and
the
baby
does
it
seem
as
if
you
were
a
child
again
kate
asked
me
i
am
sure
this
is
just
the
same
as
the
first
circus
i
ever
saw
it
grows
more
and
more
familiar
and
it
puzzles
me
to
think
they
should
not
have
altered
in
the
least
while
i
have
changed
so
much
and
have
even
had
time
to
grow
up
you
do
know
how
it
is
making
me
remember
other
things
of
which
i
have
not
thought
for
years
i
was
seven
years
old
when
i
went
that
first
time
uncle
jack
invited
me
i
had
a
new
parasol
and
he
laughed
because
i
would
hold
it
over
my
shoulder
when
the
sun
was
in
my
face
he
took
me
into
the
and
bought
me
everything
i
asked
for
on
the
way
home
and
we
did
not
get
home
until
twilight
the
rest
of
the
family
had
dined
at
four
and
gone
out
for
a
long
drive
and
it
was
such
fun
to
have
our
dinner
by
ourselves
i
sat
at
the
head
of
the
table
in
mamma
place
and
when
bridget
came
down
and
insisted
that
i
must
go
to
bed
uncle
jack
came
softly
up
stairs
and
sat
by
the
window
smoking
and
telling
me
stories
he
ran
and
hid
in
the
closet
when
we
heard
mamma
coming
up
and
when
she
found
him
out
by
the
and
made
believe
scold
him
i
thought
she
was
in
earnest
and
begged
him
off
yes
and
i
remember
that
bridget
sat
in
the
next
room
making
her
new
dress
so
she
could
wear
it
to
church
next
day
i
thought
it
was
a
beautiful
dress
and
besought
mamma
to
have
one
like
it
it
was
bright
green
with
yellow
spots
all
over
it
said
kate
ah
poor
uncle
jack
he
was
so
good
to
me
we
were
always
telling
stories
of
what
we
would
do
when
i
was
grown
up
he
died
in
canton
the
next
year
and
i
cried
myself
ill
but
for
a
long
time
i
thought
he
might
not
be
dead
after
all
and
might
come
home
any
day
he
used
to
seem
so
old
to
me
and
he
really
was
just
out
of
college
and
not
so
old
as
i
am
now
that
day
at
the
circus
he
had
a
pink
rosebud
in
his
buttonhole
and
ah
when
have
i
ever
thought
of
this
before
a
woman
sat
before
us
who
had
a
stiff
little
cape
on
her
bonnet
like
a
shelf
and
i
carefully
put
peanuts
round
the
edge
of
it
and
when
she
moved
her
head
they
would
fall
i
thought
it
was
the
best
fun
in
the
world
and
i
wished
uncle
jack
to
ride
the
donkey
i
was
sure
he
could
keep
on
because
his
horse
had
capered
about
with
him
one
day
on
beacon
street
and
i
thought
him
a
perfect
rider
since
nothing
had
happened
to
him
then
i
remember
said
kew
presently
that
just
before
i
was
married
took
me
over
to
wareham
corners
to
a
caravan
my
sister
hannah
and
the
young
man
who
was
keeping
company
with
her
went
too
i
have
been
to
one
since
till
and
it
does
carry
me
back
same
it
does
you
miss
kate
it
does
seem
more
than
five
years
ago
and
what
would
i
have
thought
if
i
had
known
and
i
were
going
to
keep
a
lighthouse
and
be
contented
there
what
more
and
sometimes
not
get
ashore
for
a
fortnight
settled
old
folks
we
were
gay
enough
in
those
days
i
know
old
miss
sabrina
smith
warned
me
that
i
better
think
twice
before
i
took
up
with
tom
kew
for
he
was
a
young
man
i
speak
o
that
to
him
in
the
when
he
sets
reading
the
almanac
half
asleep
and
i
knitting
and
the
wind
a
howling
and
the
waves
coming
ashore
on
those
rocks
as
if
they
wished
they
could
put
out
the
light
and
blow
down
the
lighthouse
we
were
reflected
on
a
good
deal
for
going
to
that
caravan
some
of
the
old
folks
did
think
it
was
improvin
well
i
should
think
that
man
was
a
trying
to
break
his
neck
coming
out
of
the
great
tent
was
disagreeable
enough
and
we
seemed
to
have
chosen
the
worst
time
for
the
crowd
pushed
fiercely
though
i
suppose
nobody
was
in
the
least
hurry
and
we
were
all
severely
jammed
while
from
somewhere
underneath
came
the
wails
of
a
deserted
dog
we
had
not
meant
to
see
the
and
went
carelessly
past
two
or
three
tents
but
when
we
came
in
sight
of
the
picture
of
the
kentucky
giantess
we
noticed
that
kew
looked
at
it
wistfully
and
we
immediately
asked
if
she
cared
anything
about
going
to
see
the
wonder
whereupon
she
confessed
that
she
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
as
a
woman
weighing
six
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
so
we
all
three
went
in
there
were
only
two
or
three
persons
inside
the
tent
beside
a
little
boy
who
played
the
the
kentucky
giantess
sat
in
two
chairs
on
a
platform
and
there
was
a
large
cage
of
monkeys
just
beyond
toward
which
kate
and
i
went
at
once
why
she
is
more
than
two
thirds
as
big
as
the
picture
said
kew
in
a
regretful
whisper
but
i
guess
she
big
enough
does
she
look
discouraged
poor
creatur
kate
and
i
felt
ashamed
of
ourselves
for
being
there
no
matter
if
she
had
consented
to
be
carried
round
for
a
show
it
must
have
been
horrible
to
be
stared
at
and
joked
about
day
after
day
and
we
gravely
looked
at
the
monkeys
and
in
a
few
minutes
turned
to
see
if
kew
were
not
ready
to
come
away
when
to
our
surprise
we
saw
that
she
was
talking
to
the
giantess
with
great
interest
and
we
went
nearer
i
thought
your
face
looked
natural
the
minute
i
set
foot
inside
the
door
said
kew
but
you
altered
some
since
i
saw
you
and
i
could
place
you
till
i
heard
you
speak
why
you
used
to
be
spare
i
am
amazed
marilly
where
are
your
folks
i
do
wonder
you
are
surprised
said
the
giantess
i
was
a
good
ways
from
this
when
you
knew
me
was
i
but
father
he
run
through
with
every
cent
he
had
before
he
died
and
took
to
drink
and
it
killed
him
after
a
while
and
then
i
begun
to
grow
worse
and
worse
till
i
could
do
nothing
to
earn
a
dollar
and
everybody
was
a
coming
to
see
me
till
at
last
i
used
to
ask
ten
cents
apiece
and
i
scratched
along
somehow
till
this
man
came
round
and
heard
of
me
and
he
offered
me
my
keep
and
good
pay
to
go
along
with
him
he
had
another
giantess
before
me
but
she
had
begun
to
fall
away
so
he
paid
her
off
and
let
her
go
this
other
giantess
was
an
awful
expense
to
him
she
was
such
an
eater
now
i
do
have
no
great
of
an
appetite
this
was
said
plaintively
and
he
raised
my
pay
since
i
been
with
him
because
we
did
so
well
i
took
up
with
his
offer
because
i
was
nothing
but
a
drag
and
never
will
be
i
as
comfortable
as
i
can
be
but
it
a
pretty
hard
business
my
oldest
boy
is
able
to
do
for
himself
but
married
this
last
year
and
his
wife
do
want
me
i
do
know
i
blame
her
either
it
would
be
something
like
if
i
had
a
daughter
now
but
there
i
getting
to
like
travelling
it
gives
anybody
a
good
deal
to
think
of
i
was
asking
the
folks
about
you
when
i
was
up
home
the
early
part
of
the
summer
said
kew
but
all
they
knew
was
that
you
were
living
out
in
new
york
state
have
you
been
living
in
kentucky
long
i
saw
it
on
the
picture
outside
no
said
the
giantess
that
was
a
picture
the
man
bought
cheap
from
another
show
that
broke
up
last
year
it
says
six
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
but
i
do
weigh
more
than
four
hundred
i
have
been
weighed
for
some
time
past
between
you
and
me
i
do
weigh
so
much
as
that
but
you
must
mention
it
for
it
would
spoil
my
reputation
and
might
hender
my
getting
another
engagement
and
then
the
poor
giantess
lost
her
professional
look
and
tone
as
she
said
i
believe
i
rather
die
than
grow
any
bigger
i
do
lose
heart
sometimes
and
wish
i
was
a
smart
woman
and
could
keep
house
i
be
smarter
than
ever
i
was
when
i
had
the
chance
i
tell
you
that
is
tom
along
with
you
no
i
came
with
these
young
ladies
miss
lancaster
and
miss
denis
who
are
stopping
over
to
deephaven
for
the
summer
kate
and
i
turned
as
we
heard
this
introduction
we
were
standing
close
by
and
i
am
proud
to
say
that
i
never
saw
kate
treat
any
one
more
politely
than
she
did
that
absurd
pitiful
creature
with
the
gilt
crown
and
many
bracelets
it
was
not
that
she
said
much
but
there
was
such
an
exquisite
courtesy
in
her
manner
and
an
apparent
unconsciousness
of
there
being
anything
in
the
least
surprising
or
uncommon
about
the
giantess
just
then
a
party
of
people
came
in
and
kew
said
good
by
reluctantly
it
has
done
me
sights
of
good
to
see
you
said
our
new
acquaintance
i
was
feeling
just
before
you
came
in
pleased
to
see
somebody
that
remembers
me
as
i
used
to
be
and
they
shook
hands
in
a
way
that
meant
a
great
deal
and
when
kate
and
i
said
good
afternoon
the
giantess
looked
at
us
gratefully
and
said
i
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
coming
in
young
ladies
walk
in
walk
in
the
man
was
shouting
as
we
came
away
walk
in
and
see
the
wonder
of
the
world
ladies
and
gentlemen
the
largest
woman
ever
seen
in
america
the
great
kentucky
giantess
would
you
have
liked
to
stay
longer
kate
asked
kew
as
we
came
down
the
street
but
she
answered
that
it
would
be
no
satisfaction
the
people
were
coming
in
and
she
would
have
no
chance
to
talk
i
never
knew
her
very
well
she
is
younger
than
i
and
she
used
to
go
to
meeting
where
i
did
but
she
lived
five
or
six
miles
from
our
house
she
had
a
hard
time
of
it
according
to
her
account
said
kew
she
used
to
be
a
dreadful
flighty
girl
but
she
lost
that
now
i
can
see
by
her
eyes
i
was
running
over
in
my
mind
to
see
if
there
was
anything
i
could
do
for
her
but
i
do
know
as
there
is
she
said
the
man
who
hired
her
was
kind
i
guess
your
treating
her
so
polite
did
her
as
much
good
as
anything
she
used
to
be
real
ambitious
i
had
it
on
my
tongue
end
to
ask
her
if
she
could
get
a
few
days
leave
and
come
out
to
stop
with
me
but
i
thought
just
in
time
that
she
sink
the
dory
in
a
minute
there
seeing
her
has
took
away
all
the
fun
said
kew
ruefully
and
we
were
all
dismal
for
a
while
but
at
last
after
we
were
fairly
started
for
home
we
began
to
be
merry
again
we
passed
the
craper
family
whom
we
had
seen
at
the
store
in
the
morning
the
children
looked
as
stupid
as
ever
but
the
father
i
am
sorry
to
say
had
been
tempted
to
drink
more
whiskey
than
was
good
for
him
he
had
a
bright
flush
on
his
cheeks
and
he
was
flourishing
his
whip
and
hoarsely
singing
some
meaningless
tune
poor
creature
said
i
i
should
think
this
day
pleasuring
would
kill
him
now
you
think
so
said
kew
sympathizingly
but
the
truth
is
you
could
kill
one
of
those
crapers
if
you
pounded
him
in
a
mortar
we
had
a
pleasant
drive
home
and
we
kept
kew
to
supper
and
afterward
went
down
to
the
shore
to
see
her
set
sail
for
home
kew
had
come
in
some
time
before
and
had
been
waiting
for
the
moon
to
rise
kew
told
us
that
she
should
have
enough
to
think
of
for
a
year
she
had
enjoyed
the
day
so
much
and
we
stood
on
the
pebbles
watching
the
boat
out
of
the
harbor
and
wishing
ourselves
on
board
it
was
such
a
beautiful
evening
we
went
to
another
show
that
summer
the
memory
of
which
will
never
fade
it
is
somewhat
impertinent
to
call
it
a
show
and
public
entertainment
is
equally
inappropriate
though
we
certainly
were
entertained
it
had
been
raining
for
two
or
three
days
the
deephavenites
spoke
of
it
as
a
spell
of
weather
just
after
tea
one
thursday
evening
kate
and
i
went
down
to
the
when
we
opened
the
great
hall
door
the
salt
air
was
delicious
but
we
found
the
town
apparently
wet
through
and
discouraged
and
though
it
had
almost
stopped
raining
just
then
there
was
a
scotch
mist
like
a
with
the
chill
taken
off
and
the
chantrey
elms
dripped
hurriedly
and
creaked
occasionally
in
the
there
will
not
be
a
on
the
wharves
for
a
week
after
this
said
i
to
kate
only
think
of
the
cases
of
rheumatism
we
stopped
for
a
few
minutes
at
the
carews
who
were
as
much
surprised
to
see
us
as
if
we
had
been
mermaids
out
of
the
sea
and
begged
us
to
give
ourselves
something
warm
to
drink
and
to
change
our
boots
the
moment
we
got
home
then
we
went
on
to
the
kate
went
in
but
stopped
as
she
came
out
with
our
letters
to
read
a
written
notice
securely
fastened
to
the
grocery
door
by
four
large
with
wide
leathers
round
their
necks
dear
said
she
exultantly
there
going
to
be
a
lecture
in
the
church
a
free
lecture
on
the
elements
of
true
manhood
you
like
to
go
and
we
went
we
were
fifteen
minutes
later
than
the
time
appointed
and
were
sorry
to
find
that
the
audience
was
almost
imperceptible
the
dampness
had
affected
the
antiquated
lamps
so
that
those
on
the
walls
and
on
the
front
of
the
gallery
were
the
dimmest
lights
i
ever
saw
and
sent
their
feeble
rays
through
a
small
space
the
edges
of
which
were
clearly
defined
there
were
two
rather
more
energetic
lights
on
the
table
near
the
pulpit
where
the
lecturer
sat
and
as
we
were
in
the
rear
of
the
church
we
could
see
the
yellow
fog
between
ourselves
and
him
there
were
fourteen
persons
in
the
audience
and
we
were
all
huddled
together
in
a
cowardly
way
in
the
pews
nearest
the
door
three
old
men
four
women
and
four
children
besides
ourselves
and
the
sexton
a
deaf
little
old
man
with
a
wooden
leg
the
children
whispered
noisily
and
soon
to
our
surprise
the
lecturer
rose
and
began
he
bowed
and
treated
us
with
beautiful
deference
and
read
his
dreary
lecture
with
enthusiasm
i
wish
i
could
say
for
his
sake
that
it
was
interesting
but
i
can
not
tell
a
lie
and
it
was
so
long
he
went
on
and
on
until
it
seemed
as
if
i
had
been
there
ever
since
i
was
a
little
girl
kate
and
i
did
not
dare
to
look
at
each
other
and
in
my
desperation
at
feeling
her
quiver
with
laughter
i
moved
to
the
other
end
of
the
pew
knocking
over
a
big
on
the
way
which
attracted
so
much
attention
that
i
have
seldom
felt
more
embarrassed
in
my
life
kate
great
dog
rose
several
times
to
shake
himself
and
yawn
loudly
and
then
lie
down
again
despairingly
you
would
have
thought
the
man
was
addressing
an
enthusiastic
young
men
christian
association
he
exhorted
with
fervor
upon
our
duties
as
citizens
and
as
voters
and
told
us
a
great
deal
about
george
washington
and
benjamin
franklin
whom
he
urged
us
to
choose
as
our
examples
he
waited
for
applause
after
each
of
his
outbursts
of
eloquence
and
presently
went
on
again
in
no
wise
disconcerted
at
the
silence
and
as
if
he
were
sure
that
he
would
fetch
us
next
time
the
rain
began
to
fall
again
heavily
and
the
wind
wailed
around
the
if
the
lecture
had
been
upon
any
other
subject
it
would
not
have
been
so
hard
for
kate
and
me
to
keep
sober
faces
but
it
was
directed
entirely
toward
young
men
and
there
was
not
a
young
man
there
the
children
in
front
of
us
mildly
scuffled
with
each
other
at
one
time
until
the
one
at
the
end
of
the
pew
dropped
a
marble
which
struck
the
floor
and
rolled
with
a
frightful
noise
down
the
edge
of
the
aisle
where
there
was
no
carpet
the
congregation
instinctively
started
up
to
look
after
it
but
we
recollected
ourselves
and
leaned
back
again
in
our
places
while
the
awed
children
after
keeping
unnaturally
quiet
fell
asleep
and
tumbled
against
each
other
helplessly
after
a
time
the
man
sat
down
and
wiped
his
forehead
looking
well
satisfied
and
when
we
were
wondering
whether
we
might
with
propriety
come
away
he
rose
again
and
said
it
was
a
free
lecture
and
he
thanked
us
for
our
kind
patronage
on
that
inclement
night
but
in
other
places
which
he
had
visited
there
had
been
a
contribution
taken
up
for
the
cause
it
would
perhaps
do
no
harm
would
the
sexton
but
the
sexton
could
not
have
heard
the
sound
of
a
cannon
at
that
distance
and
slumbered
on
neither
kate
nor
i
had
any
money
except
a
bill
in
my
purse
and
some
coppers
in
the
pocket
of
her
cloak
which
she
assured
me
she
was
prepared
to
give
but
we
saw
no
signs
of
the
sexton
waking
and
as
one
of
the
women
kindly
went
forward
to
wake
the
children
we
all
rose
and
came
away
after
we
had
made
as
much
fun
and
laughed
as
long
as
we
pleased
that
night
we
became
suddenly
conscious
of
the
pitiful
side
of
it
all
and
being
anxious
that
every
one
should
have
the
highest
opinion
of
deephaven
we
sent
tom
dockum
early
in
the
morning
with
an
anonymous
note
to
the
lecturer
whom
he
found
without
much
trouble
but
afterward
we
were
disturbed
at
hearing
that
he
was
going
to
repeat
his
lecture
that
evening
the
wind
having
gone
round
to
the
northwest
and
i
have
no
doubt
there
were
a
good
many
women
able
to
be
out
and
that
he
harvested
enough
pieces
to
pay
his
expenses
without
our
help
though
he
had
particularly
told
us
it
was
for
the
cause
the
evening
before
and
that
ought
to
have
been
a
consolation
one
of
the
chief
pleasures
in
deephaven
was
our
housekeeping
going
to
market
was
apt
to
use
up
a
whole
morning
especially
if
we
went
to
the
we
depended
somewhat
upon
supplies
from
boston
but
sometimes
we
used
to
chase
a
butcher
who
took
a
drive
in
his
old
cart
when
he
felt
like
it
and
as
for
fish
there
were
always
enough
to
be
caught
even
if
we
could
not
buy
any
our
acquaintances
would
often
ask
if
we
had
anything
for
dinner
that
day
and
would
kindly
suggest
that
somebody
had
been
boiling
lobsters
or
that
a
boat
had
just
come
in
with
some
nice
mackerel
or
that
somebody
over
on
the
ridge
was
calculating
to
kill
a
lamb
and
we
had
better
speak
for
a
quarter
in
good
season
i
am
afraid
we
were
looked
upon
as
being
in
danger
of
becoming
epicures
which
we
certainly
are
not
and
we
undoubtedly
roused
a
great
deal
of
interest
because
we
used
to
eat
mushrooms
which
grew
in
the
suburbs
of
the
town
in
wild
luxuriance
one
morning
maggie
told
us
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
house
for
dinner
and
taking
an
early
start
we
went
at
once
down
to
the
store
to
ask
if
the
butcher
had
been
seen
but
finding
that
he
had
gone
out
fishing
for
two
days
and
that
when
he
came
back
he
had
planned
to
kill
a
veal
we
left
word
for
a
sufficient
piece
of
the
doomed
animal
to
be
set
apart
for
our
family
and
strolled
down
to
the
shore
to
see
if
we
could
find
some
mackerel
but
there
was
not
a
fisherman
in
sight
and
after
going
to
all
the
we
concluded
that
we
had
better
provide
for
ourselves
we
had
not
brought
our
own
lines
but
we
knew
where
danny
kept
his
and
after
finding
a
basket
of
suitable
size
and
taking
some
clams
from
danny
we
went
over
to
the
hull
of
an
old
schooner
which
was
going
to
pieces
alongside
one
of
the
ruined
wharves
we
looked
down
the
hatchway
into
the
hold
and
could
see
the
flounders
and
sculpin
swimming
about
lazily
and
once
in
a
while
a
little
pollock
scooted
down
among
them
impertinently
and
then
disappeared
there
is
that
same
big
flounder
that
we
saw
day
before
yesterday
said
i
i
know
him
because
one
of
his
fins
is
half
gone
i
do
believe
he
can
get
out
for
the
hole
in
the
side
of
the
schooner
is
very
wide
and
it
is
higher
up
than
flounders
ever
swim
perhaps
he
came
in
when
he
was
young
and
was
too
lazy
to
go
out
until
he
was
so
large
he
could
flounders
always
look
so
lazy
and
as
if
they
thought
a
great
deal
of
themselves
i
hope
they
will
think
enough
of
themselves
to
keep
away
from
my
hook
this
morning
said
kate
philosophically
and
the
sculpin
too
i
am
going
to
fish
for
cunners
alone
and
keep
my
line
short
and
she
perched
herself
on
the
quarter
baited
her
hook
carefully
and
threw
it
over
with
a
to
call
attention
i
went
to
the
rail
at
the
side
and
we
were
presently
much
encouraged
by
pulling
up
two
small
cunners
and
felt
that
our
prospects
for
dinner
were
excellent
then
i
unhappily
caught
so
large
a
sculpin
that
it
was
like
pulling
up
an
open
umbrella
and
after
i
had
thrown
him
into
the
hold
to
keep
company
with
the
flounder
our
usual
good
luck
seemed
to
desert
us
it
was
one
of
the
days
when
in
spite
of
twitching
the
line
and
using
all
the
tricks
we
could
think
of
the
cunners
would
either
eat
our
bait
or
keep
away
altogether
kate
at
last
said
we
must
starve
unless
we
could
catch
the
big
flounder
and
asked
me
to
drop
my
hook
down
the
hatchway
but
it
seemed
almost
too
bad
to
destroy
his
innocent
happiness
just
then
we
heard
the
noise
of
oars
and
to
our
delight
saw
sands
in
his
dory
just
beyond
the
next
wharf
any
luck
said
he
ye
do
care
anything
about
going
out
this
morning
we
are
not
amusing
ourselves
we
are
trying
to
catch
some
fish
for
dinner
said
kate
could
you
wait
out
by
the
red
buoy
while
we
get
a
few
more
and
then
should
you
be
back
by
noon
or
are
you
going
for
a
longer
voyage
captain
sands
i
was
going
out
to
black
rock
for
cunners
myself
said
the
i
should
be
pleased
to
take
ye
if
ye
like
to
go
so
we
wound
up
our
lines
and
took
our
basket
and
clams
and
went
round
to
meet
the
boat
i
felt
like
rowing
and
took
the
oars
while
kate
was
mending
her
sinker
and
the
was
busy
with
a
snarled
line
it
pretty
hot
said
he
presently
but
i
see
a
breeze
coming
in
and
the
clouds
seem
to
be
thickening
i
guess
we
shall
have
it
cooler
towards
noon
it
looked
last
night
as
if
we
were
going
to
have
foul
weather
but
the
scud
seemed
to
blow
off
and
it
was
as
pretty
a
morning
as
ever
i
see
growing
moon
chaws
up
the
clouds
my
used
to
say
he
was
as
knowing
about
the
weather
as
anybody
i
ever
come
across
always
hit
it
just
about
right
some
folks
lay
all
the
weather
to
the
moon
accordin
to
where
she
quarters
and
when
she
in
perigee
we
going
to
have
this
kind
of
weather
and
when
she
in
apogee
she
got
to
do
so
and
so
for
sartain
but
he
used
to
laugh
at
all
them
things
he
said
it
never
made
no
kind
of
difference
and
he
went
by
the
looks
of
the
clouds
and
the
feel
of
the
air
and
he
thought
folks
could
make
no
kind
of
rules
that
held
good
that
had
to
do
with
the
moon
well
he
did
use
to
depend
on
the
moon
some
everybody
knows
we
are
so
likely
to
have
foul
weather
in
a
growing
moon
as
we
be
when
she
waning
but
some
folks
i
could
name
they
ca
do
nothing
without
having
the
moon
opinion
on
it
when
i
went
my
second
voyage
afore
the
mast
we
was
in
port
ten
days
at
cadiz
and
the
ship
she
needed
salting
dreadful
the
mate
kept
telling
the
captain
how
low
the
salt
was
in
her
and
we
was
going
a
long
voyage
from
there
but
no
he
would
have
her
salted
nohow
because
it
was
the
wane
of
the
moon
he
was
an
amazing
set
kind
of
man
the
was
and
would
have
his
own
way
on
sea
or
shore
the
mate
was
his
own
brother
and
they
used
to
fight
like
a
cat
and
dog
they
owned
most
of
the
ship
between
i
was
slushing
the
and
heard
a
about
the
salt
the
was
a
seaman
and
died
rich
but
he
was
dreadful
notional
i
know
one
time
we
were
a
lyin
out
in
the
stream
all
ready
to
weigh
anchor
and
everything
was
in
trim
the
men
were
up
in
the
rigging
and
a
fresh
breeze
going
out
just
what
we
been
waiting
for
and
the
word
was
passed
to
take
in
sail
and
make
everything
fast
the
men
swore
and
everybody
said
the
had
had
some
kind
of
a
warning
but
that
night
it
began
to
blow
and
i
tell
you
afore
morning
we
were
glad
enough
we
were
in
harbor
the
old
victor
she
dragged
her
anchor
and
the
sail
and
got
loose
somehow
and
was
blown
out
of
the
most
of
the
canvas
and
rigging
was
old
but
we
had
weather
after
that
and
did
bend
near
all
the
new
sail
we
had
aboard
though
the
was
most
afraid
we
come
short
when
we
left
boston
that
was
sixty
year
ago
said
the
captain
reflectively
how
time
does
slip
away
you
young
folks
have
any
idea
she
was
a
ship
the
old
victor
was
though
i
suppose
she
would
cut
much
of
a
dash
now
of
some
of
the
new
clippers
there
used
to
be
some
crafts
in
those
days
there
was
the
old
brig
hannah
they
used
to
say
she
would
sail
backwards
as
fast
as
forwards
and
she
was
so
square
in
the
bows
they
used
to
call
her
the
she
was
master
old
the
hannah
was
and
there
was
a
port
from
here
to
new
orleans
where
she
was
known
she
used
to
carry
a
master
cargo
for
her
size
more
than
some
ships
that
ranked
two
hundred
and
fifty
ton
and
she
was
put
down
for
two
hundred
she
used
to
make
good
voyages
the
hannah
did
and
then
there
was
the
pactolus
she
was
just
about
such
another
you
would
have
laughed
to
see
her
she
sailed
out
of
this
port
for
a
good
many
years
wall
he
told
me
that
if
he
had
her
before
the
wind
with
a
cargo
of
cotton
she
would
make
a
middling
good
run
but
load
her
deep
with
salt
and
you
might
as
well
try
to
sail
a
stick
of
oak
timber
with
a
handkerchief
she
was
a
ship
i
should
wonder
if
her
timbers
were
afloat
somewhere
yet
she
was
sold
to
some
parties
out
in
san
francisco
there
everything
changed
from
what
it
was
when
i
used
to
follow
the
sea
i
wonder
sometimes
if
the
sailors
have
as
queer
works
aboard
ship
as
they
used
bless
ye
deephaven
used
to
be
a
different
place
to
what
it
is
now
there
was
hardly
a
day
in
the
year
that
you
did
hear
the
shipwrights
hammers
and
there
was
always
something
going
on
at
the
wharves
you
would
see
the
folks
from
up
country
comin
in
with
their
loads
of
oak
knees
and
plank
and
logs
o
for
keels
when
there
was
snow
on
the
ground
in
and
the
big
sticks
of
for
masts
would
come
crawling
along
the
road
with
their
three
and
four
yoke
of
oxen
all
frosted
up
the
sleds
creaking
and
the
snow
growling
and
the
men
flapping
their
arms
to
keep
warm
and
hallooing
as
if
there
wa
nothin
else
goin
on
in
the
world
except
to
get
them
masts
to
the
bless
ye
two
o
them
teams
together
would
stretch
from
here
up
to
the
widow
jim
place
no
such
nowadays
i
suppose
the
sailors
are
very
jolly
together
sometimes
said
kate
meditatively
with
the
least
flicker
of
a
smile
at
me
the
captain
did
not
answer
for
a
minute
as
he
was
battling
with
an
obstinate
snarl
in
his
line
but
when
he
had
found
the
right
loop
he
said
i
had
the
best
times
and
the
hardest
times
of
my
life
at
sea
that
certain
i
was
just
thinking
it
over
when
you
spoke
i
tell
you
some
stories
one
day
or
that
please
you
land
you
no
idea
what
tricks
some
of
those
wild
fellows
will
be
up
to
now
saying
they
fetch
home
a
cargo
of
wines
and
they
want
a
drink
they
got
a
trick
so
they
can
get
it
saying
it
champagne
they
fetch
up
a
basket
and
how
do
you
suppose
they
get
into
it
of
course
we
did
know
well
every
basket
will
be
counted
and
they
fastened
up
particular
so
they
can
tell
in
a
minute
if
they
been
tampered
with
and
neither
must
you
draw
the
corks
if
you
could
get
the
basket
open
i
suppose
ye
may
have
seen
champagne
how
it
all
wired
and
waxed
now
they
take
a
clean
tub
them
fellows
do
and
just
shake
the
basket
and
jounce
it
up
and
down
till
they
break
the
bottles
and
let
the
wine
drain
out
then
they
take
it
down
in
the
hold
and
put
it
back
with
the
rest
and
when
the
cargo
is
delivered
there
only
one
or
two
whole
bottles
in
that
basket
and
there
a
dreadful
fuss
about
its
being
stowed
so
foolish
the
captain
told
this
with
an
air
of
great
satisfaction
but
we
did
not
show
the
least
suspicion
that
he
might
have
assisted
at
some
such
festivity
then
they
have
a
way
of
breaking
into
a
cask
it
wo
do
to
start
the
bung
and
it
wo
do
to
bore
a
hole
where
it
can
be
seen
but
up
to
that
they
slip
back
one
of
the
end
hoops
and
bore
two
holes
underneath
it
one
for
the
air
to
go
in
and
one
for
the
liquor
to
come
out
and
after
they
get
all
out
they
want
they
put
in
some
spigots
and
cut
them
down
close
to
the
stave
knock
back
the
hoop
again
and
there
ye
are
all
trig
i
never
should
have
thought
of
it
said
kate
admiringly
there
is
nothing
sands
went
on
that
hender
some
masters
from
cheating
the
owners
a
little
get
them
off
in
a
foreign
port
and
there
nobody
to
watch
and
they
most
of
them
have
a
feeling
that
they
ai
getting
full
pay
and
they
charge
things
to
the
ship
that
she
never
seen
nor
heard
of
there
were
two
shipmasters
that
sailed
out
of
salem
i
heard
one
of
tell
the
story
they
had
both
come
into
port
from
liverpool
nigh
the
same
time
and
one
of
he
was
dressed
up
in
a
handsome
suit
of
clothes
and
the
other
looked
kind
of
did
you
get
them
clothes
says
he
to
liverpool
says
the
other
do
mean
to
say
you
come
away
without
none
cheap
as
cloth
was
there
yes
says
the
other
ca
afford
to
wear
such
clothes
as
those
be
and
i
do
see
how
you
can
either
to
the
ship
bless
ye
the
owners
expect
it
so
the
next
the
poor
he
had
a
nice
rig
for
himself
made
to
the
best
tailor
in
bristol
and
charged
it
say
ten
pounds
in
the
ship
account
and
when
he
came
home
the
ship
husband
he
was
looking
over
the
papers
and
this
says
he
come
the
ship
to
run
up
a
tailor
bill
them
mine
says
the
very
meaching
understood
that
there
would
be
no
objection
made
you
made
a
mistake
says
the
other
laughing
i
better
scratch
this
out
and
it
was
long
before
the
met
the
one
who
had
put
him
up
to
doing
it
and
he
give
him
a
blowing
up
for
getting
him
into
such
a
fix
sakes
alive
says
he
you
fool
enough
to
set
it
down
in
the
account
why
i
put
mine
in
so
many
bolts
of
russia
duck
captain
sands
seemed
to
enjoy
this
reminiscence
and
to
our
satisfaction
in
a
few
minutes
after
he
had
offered
to
take
the
oars
he
went
on
to
tell
us
another
story
why
as
for
cheating
there
plenty
of
that
all
over
the
world
the
first
i
went
into
havana
as
master
of
the
deerhound
she
had
never
been
in
the
port
before
and
had
to
be
measured
and
recorded
and
then
pay
her
tonnage
duties
every
time
she
went
into
port
there
afterward
according
to
what
she
was
registered
on
the
books
the
inspector
he
come
aboard
and
he
went
below
and
looked
round
and
he
measured
her
between
decks
but
he
never
offered
to
set
down
any
figgers
and
when
we
came
back
into
the
cabin
says
he
yes
good
ship
you
put
one
bloon
front
of
this
eye
says
he
i
not
see
with
him
and
you
put
one
more
doubloon
front
of
other
eye
and
how
you
think
i
see
at
all
what
figger
you
write
so
i
took
his
book
and
i
set
down
her
measurements
and
made
her
out
twenty
ton
short
and
he
took
his
doubloons
and
shoved
into
his
pocket
there
it
is
what
you
call
straight
dealing
but
everybody
done
it
that
dared
and
you
eat
up
all
the
profits
of
a
and
the
owners
would
just
as
soon
try
a
little
air
if
you
paid
all
those
dues
according
to
law
tonnage
was
dreadful
high
and
wharfage
too
in
some
ports
and
they
get
your
last
cent
some
way
or
if
ye
were
sharp
old
carew
uncle
to
them
ye
see
to
meeting
did
a
smart
thing
in
the
time
of
the
embargo
folks
got
tired
of
it
and
it
was
dreadful
hard
times
ships
rotting
at
the
wharves
and
deephaven
never
was
quite
the
same
afterward
though
the
old
place
held
out
for
a
good
while
before
she
let
go
as
ye
see
her
now
you
had
a
hard
grip
o
when
i
was
a
young
man
to
make
me
believe
it
would
ever
be
so
dull
here
well
carew
he
bought
an
old
brig
that
was
lying
over
by
east
parish
and
he
began
fitting
her
up
and
loading
her
for
the
west
indies
and
the
farmers
they
come
in
there
by
night
from
all
round
the
country
to
sell
and
lumber
and
potatoes
and
glad
enough
they
were
i
tell
ye
the
rigging
was
put
in
order
and
it
was
long
before
she
was
ready
to
sail
and
it
was
all
kept
mighty
quiet
she
lay
up
to
an
old
wharf
in
a
cove
where
she
would
be
much
noticed
and
they
took
care
not
to
paint
her
any
or
to
attract
any
attention
one
day
carew
was
over
in
riverport
dining
out
with
some
gentlemen
and
the
revenue
officer
sat
next
to
him
and
by
and
by
says
he
wo
ye
take
a
ride
with
me
this
afternoon
i
had
warning
that
there
a
brig
loading
for
the
west
indies
over
beyond
deephaven
somewheres
and
i
going
over
to
seize
her
and
he
laughed
to
himself
as
if
he
expected
fun
and
something
in
his
pocket
beside
well
the
first
minute
that
carew
dared
after
dinner
he
slipped
out
and
he
hired
the
swiftest
horse
in
riverport
and
rode
for
dear
life
and
told
the
folks
who
were
in
the
secret
and
some
who
were
what
was
the
matter
and
every
soul
turned
to
and
helped
finish
loading
her
and
getting
the
rigging
ready
and
the
water
aboard
but
just
as
they
were
leaving
the
cove
the
wind
was
blowing
just
right
along
came
the
revenue
officer
with
two
or
three
men
and
they
come
off
in
a
boat
and
boarded
her
as
important
as
could
be
ye
step
into
the
cabin
gentlemen
and
take
a
glass
o
wine
says
carew
very
polite
and
the
wind
came
in
fresher
something
like
a
squall
for
a
few
minutes
and
the
men
had
the
sails
spread
before
you
could
say
jack
and
before
those
fellows
knew
what
they
were
about
the
old
brig
was
a
standing
out
to
sea
and
the
folks
on
the
wharves
cheered
and
yelled
the
gave
the
officers
a
good
scare
and
offered
a
free
passage
to
the
west
indies
and
finally
they
said
they
would
report
at
headquarters
if
he
let
go
ashore
so
he
told
the
sailors
to
lower
their
boat
about
two
miles
off
deephaven
and
they
pulled
ashore
meek
enough
carew
had
a
run
and
made
a
lot
of
money
so
i
have
heard
it
said
bless
ye
every
shipmaster
would
have
done
just
the
same
if
he
had
dared
and
everybody
was
glad
when
they
heard
about
it
dreadful
foolish
piece
of
business
that
embargo
was
now
i
declare
said
captain
sands
after
he
had
finished
this
narrative
here
i
a
telling
stories
and
you
doin
all
the
work
you
pull
a
boat
ahead
of
anybody
if
you
keep
on
tom
kew
was
up
both
of
you
to
me
the
other
day
says
he
do
put
on
no
airs
but
i
tell
ye
they
can
pull
a
boat
well
and
swim
like
fish
says
he
there
now
if
you
give
me
the
oars
i
put
the
dory
just
where
i
want
her
and
you
can
be
getting
your
lines
ready
i
know
a
place
here
where
it
always
fishing
and
i
guess
we
get
something
kate
and
i
cracked
our
clams
on
the
gunwale
of
the
boat
and
cut
them
into
nice
little
bits
for
bait
with
a
piece
of
the
shell
and
by
the
time
the
captain
had
thrown
out
the
killick
we
were
ready
to
begin
and
found
the
fishing
much
more
exciting
than
it
had
been
at
the
wharf
i
do
know
as
i
ever
see
bite
faster
said
the
old
sailor
presently
guess
it
because
they
like
the
folks
that
fishing
well
i
pleased
i
thought
i
let
take
some
along
to
denby
in
the
cart
if
i
got
more
than
i
could
use
at
home
i
on
having
such
a
lively
crew
aboard
i
ye
would
care
about
going
out
a
little
further
by
and
by
to
see
if
we
ca
get
two
or
three
haddock
and
we
answered
that
we
should
like
nothing
better
it
was
growing
cloudy
and
was
much
cooler
the
perfection
of
a
day
for
fishing
and
we
sat
there
diligently
pulling
in
cunners
and
talking
a
little
once
in
a
while
the
tide
was
nearly
out
and
black
rock
looked
almost
large
enough
to
be
called
an
island
the
sea
was
smooth
and
the
low
waves
broke
lazily
among
the
ledges
while
our
boat
swayed
about
on
the
water
lifting
and
falling
gently
as
the
waves
went
in
shore
we
were
not
a
very
long
way
from
the
lighthouse
and
once
we
could
see
kew
big
white
apron
as
she
stood
in
the
doorway
for
a
few
minutes
there
was
no
noise
except
the
plash
of
the
waves
and
the
occasional
flutter
of
a
fish
in
the
bottom
of
the
dory
kate
and
i
always
killed
our
fish
at
once
by
a
rap
on
the
head
for
it
certainly
saved
the
poor
creatures
much
discomfort
and
ourselves
as
well
and
it
made
it
easier
to
take
them
off
the
hook
than
if
they
were
flopping
about
and
making
us
aware
of
our
cruelty
suddenly
the
captain
wound
up
his
line
and
said
he
thought
we
better
be
going
in
and
kate
and
i
looked
at
him
with
surprise
it
is
only
half
past
ten
said
i
looking
at
my
watch
do
hurry
in
on
our
account
added
kate
persuasively
for
we
were
having
a
very
good
time
i
guess
we
wo
mind
about
the
haddock
i
got
a
feelin
we
better
go
ashore
and
he
looked
up
into
the
sky
and
turned
to
see
the
west
i
knew
there
was
something
the
matter
there
going
to
be
a
shower
and
we
looked
behind
us
to
see
a
bank
of
heavy
clouds
coming
over
fast
i
wish
we
had
two
pair
of
oars
said
captain
sands
i
afraid
we
shall
get
caught
you
need
mind
us
said
kate
we
are
in
the
least
afraid
of
our
clothes
and
we
do
get
cold
when
we
wet
we
have
made
sure
of
that
well
i
glad
to
hear
that
said
the
are
apt
to
be
dreadful
scared
of
a
wetting
but
i
just
as
lief
not
get
wet
myself
i
had
a
twinge
of
rheumatism
yesterday
i
guess
we
get
ashore
fast
enough
no
i
feel
well
enough
but
you
can
row
if
you
want
to
and
i
take
the
oars
the
last
part
of
the
way
when
we
reached
the
moorings
the
clouds
were
black
and
the
thunder
rattled
and
boomed
over
the
sea
while
heavy
spatters
of
rain
were
already
falling
we
did
not
go
to
the
wharves
but
stopped
down
the
shore
at
the
the
nearer
place
of
shelter
you
just
select
some
of
those
cunners
said
the
captain
who
was
beginning
to
be
a
little
out
of
breath
and
then
you
can
run
right
up
and
get
under
cover
and
i
put
a
bit
of
old
sail
over
the
rest
of
the
fish
to
keep
the
fresh
water
off
by
the
time
the
boat
touched
the
shore
and
we
had
pulled
it
up
on
the
pebbles
the
rain
had
begun
in
good
earnest
luckily
there
was
a
barrow
lying
near
and
we
loaded
that
in
a
hurry
and
just
then
the
captain
caught
sight
of
a
red
shirt
in
an
open
door
and
shouted
halloa
danny
lend
us
a
hand
with
these
fish
for
nigh
on
to
being
shipwrecked
and
then
we
ran
up
to
the
and
waited
awhile
though
we
stood
in
the
doorway
watching
the
lightning
and
there
were
so
many
leaks
in
the
roof
that
we
might
almost
as
well
have
been
out
of
doors
it
was
one
of
danny
quietest
days
and
he
silently
beheaded
hake
only
winking
at
us
once
very
gravely
at
something
our
other
companion
said
there
said
captain
sands
folks
may
say
what
they
have
a
mind
to
i
did
see
that
shower
coming
up
and
i
know
as
well
as
i
want
to
that
my
wife
did
and
impressed
it
on
my
mind
our
house
sets
high
and
she
watches
the
sky
and
is
a
worrying
when
i
go
out
fishing
for
fear
something
going
to
happen
to
me
specially
sence
i
got
to
be
along
in
years
this
was
just
what
kate
and
i
wished
to
hear
for
we
had
been
told
that
captain
sands
had
most
decided
opinions
on
dreams
and
other
mysteries
and
could
tell
some
stories
which
were
considered
incredible
by
even
a
deephaven
audience
to
whom
the
marvellous
was
of
occurrence
then
it
has
happened
before
asked
kate
i
wondered
why
you
started
so
suddenly
to
come
in
happened
said
the
captain
bless
ye
yes
i
tell
you
my
views
about
these
one
o
those
days
i
thought
a
good
deal
about
by
spells
not
that
i
can
explain
nor
anybody
else
but
it
no
use
to
laugh
at
as
some
folks
do
lant
you
know
lant
he
and
i
have
talked
it
over
and
he
says
to
me
got
some
story
of
the
kind
they
will
believe
in
spite
of
everything
and
yet
they
wo
believe
yourn
the
shower
seemed
to
be
over
now
and
we
felt
compelled
to
go
home
as
the
captain
did
not
go
on
with
his
remarks
i
hope
he
did
not
see
danny
wink
skipper
scudder
who
was
danny
friend
and
partner
came
up
just
then
and
asked
us
if
we
knew
what
the
sign
was
when
the
sun
came
out
through
the
rain
i
said
that
i
had
always
heard
it
would
rain
again
next
day
o
no
said
skipper
scudder
the
devil
is
whipping
his
wife
after
dinner
kate
and
i
went
for
a
walk
through
some
pine
woods
which
were
beautiful
after
the
rain
the
mosses
and
lichens
which
had
been
dried
up
were
all
freshened
and
blooming
out
in
the
dampness
the
smell
of
the
wet
was
unusually
sweet
and
we
wandered
about
for
an
hour
or
two
there
to
find
some
ferns
we
wanted
and
then
walked
over
toward
east
parish
and
home
by
the
long
beach
late
in
the
afternoon
we
came
as
far
as
the
meaning
to
go
home
through
the
lane
but
to
our
delight
we
saw
captain
sands
sitting
alone
on
an
old
overturned
whaleboat
whittling
busily
at
a
piece
of
dried
kelp
good
evenin
said
our
friend
cheerfully
and
we
explained
that
we
had
taken
a
long
walk
and
thought
we
would
rest
awhile
before
we
went
home
to
supper
kate
perched
herself
on
the
boat
and
i
sat
down
on
a
knee
which
lay
on
the
pebbles
did
get
any
hurt
from
being
out
in
the
shower
i
hope
no
indeed
laughed
kate
and
we
had
such
a
good
time
i
hope
you
wo
mind
taking
us
out
again
some
time
bless
ye
no
said
the
captain
my
girl
she
that
mis
winslow
over
to
riverport
used
to
go
out
with
me
a
good
deal
and
it
seemed
natural
to
have
you
aboard
i
missed
after
she
got
married
for
she
was
ready
to
go
anywhere
of
father
had
slim
health
of
late
years
i
tell
she
been
too
much
shut
up
out
of
the
fresh
air
and
sun
when
she
was
young
her
mother
never
could
on
her
to
set
in
the
house
stiddy
and
sew
and
she
used
to
have
great
misgivin
that
never
was
going
to
be
capable
how
about
those
fish
you
caught
this
morning
good
were
they
mis
sands
had
dinner
on
the
stocks
when
i
got
home
and
she
said
she
would
fry
any
but
i
to
have
this
noon
i
like
best
right
out
o
the
water
little
more
and
we
should
have
got
them
wet
that
one
of
my
whims
i
ca
bear
to
let
fish
get
rained
on
o
captain
sands
said
i
there
being
a
convenient
pause
you
were
speaking
of
your
wife
just
now
did
you
ask
her
if
she
saw
the
shower
first
thing
she
spoke
of
when
i
got
into
the
house
says
she
was
afraid
you
would
see
the
rain
coming
in
time
and
i
had
my
heart
in
my
mouth
when
it
began
to
thunder
i
thought
you
get
soaked
through
and
be
laid
up
for
a
fortnight
says
she
guess
a
summer
shower
wo
hurt
an
old
sailor
like
me
says
i
and
the
captain
reached
for
another
piece
of
his
and
whittled
away
more
busily
than
ever
kate
took
out
her
knife
and
also
began
to
cut
kelp
and
i
threw
pebbles
in
the
hope
of
hitting
a
spider
which
sat
complacently
on
a
stone
not
far
away
and
when
he
suddenly
vanished
there
was
nothing
for
me
to
do
but
to
whittle
kelp
also
do
you
suppose
said
kate
that
sands
really
made
you
know
about
that
shower
the
captain
put
on
his
most
serious
look
coughed
slowly
and
moved
himself
a
few
inches
nearer
us
along
the
boat
i
think
he
fully
understood
the
importance
and
solemnity
of
the
subject
it
ai
for
us
to
say
what
we
do
know
or
do
for
there
nothing
sartain
but
i
made
up
my
mind
long
ago
that
there
something
about
these
my
wife
and
me
will
be
sitting
there
to
home
and
there
be
no
word
between
us
for
an
hour
and
then
of
a
sudden
we
speak
up
about
the
same
thing
now
the
way
i
view
it
she
either
puts
it
into
my
head
or
i
into
hers
i
spoke
up
lots
of
times
about
something
when
i
did
know
what
i
was
going
to
say
when
i
began
and
she
say
she
was
just
thinking
of
that
like
as
not
you
have
noticed
it
sometimes
there
was
something
my
mind
was
dwellin
on
yesterday
and
she
come
right
out
with
it
and
i
a
good
deal
rather
she
had
said
the
captain
ruefully
i
did
want
to
rake
it
all
over
i
sure
and
then
he
recollected
himself
and
was
silent
which
his
audience
must
confess
to
have
regretted
for
a
moment
i
used
to
think
a
good
deal
about
such
things
when
i
was
younger
and
i
free
to
say
i
took
more
stock
in
dreams
and
such
like
than
i
do
now
i
old
parson
lorimer
this
parson
lorimer
father
who
was
settled
here
first
spoke
to
me
once
about
it
and
said
it
was
a
tempting
of
providence
and
that
we
had
no
right
to
pry
into
secrets
i
know
i
had
a
then
that
i
picked
up
in
a
shop
in
bristol
once
when
i
was
there
on
the
ranger
and
all
the
young
folks
were
beset
to
get
sight
of
it
i
see
what
fools
it
made
of
folks
bothering
their
heads
about
such
things
and
i
pretty
much
let
them
go
all
this
stuff
about
is
enough
to
make
a
man
crazy
you
do
get
no
good
by
it
i
come
across
a
paper
once
with
a
lot
of
letters
in
it
from
sperits
and
i
cast
my
eye
over
and
i
says
to
myself
i
always
was
given
to
understand
that
when
we
come
to
a
futur
state
we
was
goin
to
have
more
wisdom
than
we
can
get
afore
but
them
letters
had
any
more
sense
to
nor
so
much
as
a
man
could
write
here
without
schooling
and
i
should
think
that
if
the
letters
be
all
straight
if
the
folks
who
wrote
had
any
kind
of
ambition
want
to
be
movin
back
here
again
but
as
for
one
person
having
something
to
do
with
another
any
distance
off
why
that
another
thing
there
ai
any
nonsense
about
that
i
know
it
true
jest
as
well
as
i
want
to
said
the
warming
up
i
tell
ye
how
i
was
led
to
make
up
my
mind
about
it
one
time
i
waked
a
man
up
out
of
a
sound
sleep
looking
at
him
and
it
set
me
to
thinking
first
there
was
any
noise
and
then
there
was
any
touch
so
he
could
feel
it
and
i
says
to
myself
could
i
ha
done
it
the
width
of
two
rooms
as
well
as
one
and
why
could
i
ha
done
it
with
my
back
turned
it
could
have
been
the
looking
so
much
as
the
thinking
and
then
i
car
it
further
and
i
says
ai
a
mile
as
good
as
a
yard
and
it
the
thinking
that
does
it
says
i
we
got
some
faculty
or
other
that
we
do
know
much
about
we
got
some
way
of
sending
our
thought
like
a
bullet
goes
out
of
a
gun
and
it
hits
we
do
know
nothing
except
what
we
see
and
some
folks
is
scared
and
some
more
thinks
it
is
all
nonsense
and
laughs
but
there
something
we
have
got
the
hang
of
it
makes
me
think
o
them
little
black
polliwogs
that
turns
into
frogs
in
the
puddles
in
the
there
a
time
before
their
tails
drop
off
and
their
legs
have
sprouted
out
when
they
do
get
any
use
o
their
legs
and
i
dare
say
in
their
way
but
after
they
get
to
be
frogs
they
find
out
what
they
for
without
no
kind
of
trouble
i
guess
we
shall
turn
these
to
account
some
time
or
seems
to
me
though
that
we
might
depend
on
now
more
than
we
do
the
captain
was
under
full
sail
on
what
we
had
heard
was
his
pet
subject
and
it
was
a
great
satisfaction
to
listen
to
what
he
had
to
say
it
loses
a
great
deal
in
being
written
for
the
old
sailor
voice
and
gestures
and
thorough
earnestness
all
carried
no
little
persuasion
and
it
was
impossible
not
to
be
sure
that
he
knew
more
than
people
usually
do
about
these
mysteries
in
which
he
delighted
now
how
can
you
account
for
this
said
he
i
remember
not
more
than
ten
years
ago
my
son
wife
was
stopping
at
our
house
and
she
had
left
her
child
at
home
while
she
come
away
for
a
rest
and
after
she
had
been
there
two
or
three
days
one
morning
she
was
sitting
in
the
kitchen
o
the
folks
and
all
of
a
sudden
she
jumped
out
of
her
chair
and
ran
into
the
bedroom
and
next
minute
she
come
out
laughing
and
looking
kind
of
scared
could
ha
taken
my
oath
says
she
i
heard
katy
cryin
out
mother
says
she
as
if
she
was
hurt
i
heard
it
so
plain
that
before
i
stopped
to
think
it
seemed
as
if
she
were
right
in
the
next
room
i
afeard
something
has
happened
but
the
folks
laughed
and
said
she
must
ha
heard
one
of
the
lambs
it
was
says
she
was
katy
and
sure
enough
just
after
dinner
a
young
man
who
lived
neighbor
to
her
come
riding
into
the
yard
to
get
her
to
go
home
for
the
baby
had
pulled
some
hot
water
over
on
to
herself
and
was
nigh
scalded
to
death
and
cryin
for
her
mother
every
minute
now
who
going
to
explain
that
it
was
any
common
hearing
that
heard
that
child
cryin
fifteen
miles
and
i
can
tell
you
another
thing
that
happened
among
my
own
folks
there
was
an
own
cousin
of
mine
married
to
a
man
by
the
name
of
john
hathorn
he
was
trading
up
to
parsonsfield
and
business
run
down
so
he
wound
up
there
and
thought
he
make
a
new
start
he
moved
down
to
denby
and
while
he
was
getting
under
way
he
left
his
family
up
to
the
old
place
and
at
the
time
i
speak
of
was
going
to
move
down
in
about
a
fortnight
one
morning
his
wife
was
fidgeting
round
and
finally
she
came
down
stairs
with
her
bonnet
and
shawl
on
and
said
somebody
must
put
the
horse
right
into
the
wagon
and
take
her
down
to
denby
what
for
mother
they
says
stop
to
talk
says
she
father
is
sick
and
wants
me
it
been
a
worrying
me
since
before
day
and
i
ca
stand
it
no
longer
and
the
short
of
the
story
is
that
she
kept
hurrying
faster
and
faster
and
then
she
got
hold
of
the
reins
herself
and
when
they
got
within
five
miles
of
the
place
the
horse
fell
dead
and
she
was
nigh
about
crazy
and
they
took
another
horse
at
a
on
the
road
it
was
the
spring
of
the
year
and
the
going
was
dreadful
and
when
they
got
to
the
house
john
hathorn
had
just
died
and
he
had
been
calling
for
his
wife
up
to
the
last
breath
he
drew
he
had
been
taken
sick
sudden
the
day
before
but
the
folks
knew
it
was
bad
travelling
and
that
she
was
a
feeble
woman
to
come
near
thirty
miles
and
they
had
no
idee
he
was
so
bad
off
i
telling
you
the
living
truth
said
captain
sands
with
an
emphatic
shake
of
his
head
more
folks
than
me
can
tell
about
it
and
if
you
were
goin
to
me
next
minute
and
hang
me
to
the
afterward
i
could
say
it
different
i
was
up
to
parsonsfield
to
the
funeral
it
was
just
after
i
quit
following
the
sea
i
never
saw
a
woman
so
broke
down
as
she
was
john
was
a
nice
man
stiddy
and
and
straightforrard
and
kind
to
his
folks
he
belonged
to
the
odd
fellows
and
they
all
marched
to
the
funeral
there
was
a
good
deal
of
respect
shown
him
i
tell
ye
there
is
another
story
i
like
to
have
ye
hear
if
it
so
that
you
ai
beat
out
hearing
me
talk
when
i
get
going
i
slip
along
as
easy
as
a
schooner
afore
the
wind
this
happened
to
my
own
father
but
i
never
heard
him
say
much
about
it
never
could
get
him
to
talk
it
over
to
any
length
best
i
could
do
but
his
father
told
me
about
it
nigh
upon
fifty
times
first
and
last
and
always
the
same
way
lived
to
be
old
and
there
was
ten
or
a
dozen
years
after
his
wife
died
that
he
lived
year
and
year
about
with
uncle
tobias
folks
and
our
folks
uncle
tobias
lived
over
on
the
ridge
i
got
home
from
my
first
as
mate
of
the
daylight
just
in
time
for
his
funeral
i
was
to
find
the
old
man
was
gone
i
fetched
him
some
tobacco
for
he
was
a
great
hand
to
smoke
and
i
was
on
his
being
pleased
old
folks
like
to
be
thought
of
and
then
he
set
more
by
me
than
by
the
other
boys
i
know
i
used
to
be
sorry
for
him
when
i
was
a
little
fellow
my
father
second
wife
she
was
a
woman
but
an
awful
driver
with
her
work
and
she
was
always
making
of
him
feel
he
was
no
use
i
do
know
as
she
meant
to
either
he
never
said
nothing
and
he
was
always
just
so
pleasant
and
he
was
fond
of
his
book
and
used
to
set
round
reading
and
tried
to
keep
himself
out
of
the
way
just
as
much
as
he
could
there
was
one
winter
when
i
was
small
that
i
had
the
and
was
very
slim
for
a
long
time
afterward
and
i
used
to
keep
along
o
and
he
would
tell
me
stories
he
been
a
sailor
it
runs
in
our
blood
to
foller
the
sea
and
he
been
wrecked
two
or
three
times
and
been
taken
by
the
algerine
pirates
you
remind
me
to
tell
you
some
time
about
that
and
i
wonder
if
you
ever
heard
about
old
citizen
leigh
that
used
to
be
about
here
when
i
was
a
boy
he
was
taken
by
the
algerines
once
and
they
was
dreadful
just
then
and
they
sent
him
home
to
get
the
ransom
money
for
the
crew
but
it
was
a
monstrous
price
they
asked
and
the
owners
would
give
it
to
him
and
they
likely
the
men
was
dead
by
that
time
any
way
old
citizen
leigh
he
went
crazy
and
used
to
go
about
the
streets
with
a
bundle
of
papers
in
his
hands
year
in
and
year
out
i
seen
him
a
good
many
times
used
to
tell
me
how
he
escaped
i
remember
it
for
ye
some
day
if
you
put
me
in
mind
i
got
to
be
mate
when
i
was
twenty
and
i
was
as
strong
a
fellow
as
you
could
scare
up
and
darin
why
it
makes
my
blood
run
cold
when
i
think
of
the
reckless
things
i
used
to
do
i
was
off
at
sea
after
i
was
fifteen
year
old
and
there
was
anybody
so
glad
to
see
me
as
when
i
came
home
i
expect
he
used
to
be
lonesome
after
i
went
off
but
then
his
mind
failed
him
quite
a
while
before
he
died
father
was
clever
to
him
and
he
get
him
anything
he
spoke
about
but
he
was
a
man
to
set
round
and
talk
and
he
never
took
notice
himself
when
was
out
of
tobacco
so
sometimes
it
would
be
a
day
or
two
i
know
better
how
he
used
to
feel
now
that
i
getting
to
be
along
in
years
myself
and
likely
to
be
some
care
to
the
folks
before
long
i
never
could
bear
to
see
old
folks
neglected
nice
old
men
and
women
who
have
worked
hard
in
their
day
and
been
useful
and
willin
i
seen
many
a
time
when
they
could
help
knowing
that
the
folks
would
a
little
rather
they
be
in
heaven
and
a
good
respectable
headstone
put
up
for
in
the
well
now
i
sure
i
forgot
what
i
was
going
to
tell
you
o
yes
about
grandmother
dreaming
about
father
when
he
come
home
from
sea
well
to
go
back
to
the
first
of
it
never
was
rugged
he
had
when
he
was
a
young
man
and
though
he
lived
to
be
so
old
he
never
could
work
hard
and
never
got
forehanded
and
aunt
hannah
starbird
over
at
east
parish
took
my
sister
to
fetch
up
because
she
was
named
for
her
and
melinda
and
tobias
stayed
at
home
with
the
old
folks
and
my
father
went
to
live
with
an
uncle
over
in
riverport
whom
he
was
named
for
he
was
in
the
west
india
trade
and
was
and
he
had
no
children
so
they
expected
he
would
do
well
by
father
he
was
dreadful
i
heard
say
he
had
the
worst
temper
that
was
ever
raised
in
deephaven
one
day
he
set
father
to
putting
some
cherries
into
a
of
rum
and
went
off
down
to
his
wharf
to
see
to
the
loading
of
a
vessel
and
afore
he
come
back
father
found
he
got
hold
of
the
wrong
and
had
a
of
the
best
holland
gin
he
tried
to
get
the
cherries
out
but
that
was
any
use
and
he
was
dreadful
afraid
of
uncle
matthew
and
he
run
away
and
never
was
heard
of
from
that
time
out
they
supposed
he
run
away
to
sea
as
he
had
a
leaning
that
way
but
nobody
ever
knew
for
certain
and
his
mother
she
mourned
herself
to
death
told
me
that
it
got
so
at
last
that
if
they
could
only
know
for
sure
that
he
was
dead
it
was
all
they
would
ask
but
it
went
on
four
years
and
got
used
to
it
some
though
grandmother
never
would
give
up
and
one
morning
early
before
day
she
waked
him
up
and
says
she
going
to
hear
from
matthew
get
up
quick
and
go
down
to
the
store
says
he
seen
him
says
grandmother
he
coming
home
he
looks
older
but
just
the
same
other
ways
and
he
got
long
hair
like
a
horse
mane
all
down
over
his
shoulders
let
the
dead
rest
says
thought
about
the
boy
till
your
head
is
turned
tell
you
i
saw
matthew
himself
says
she
i
want
you
to
go
right
down
to
see
if
there
is
a
letter
and
she
kept
at
him
till
he
saddled
the
horse
and
he
got
down
to
the
store
before
it
was
opened
in
the
morning
and
he
had
to
wait
round
and
when
the
man
came
over
to
unlock
it
he
was
ashamed
to
tell
what
his
errand
was
for
he
had
been
so
many
times
and
everybody
supposed
the
boy
was
dead
when
he
asked
for
a
letter
the
man
said
there
was
none
there
and
asked
if
he
was
expecting
any
particular
one
he
did
get
many
letters
i
all
his
folks
lived
about
here
and
people
did
write
any
to
speak
of
in
those
days
said
he
thought
he
would
make
such
a
fool
of
himself
again
but
he
did
say
anything
and
he
waited
round
awhile
talking
to
one
and
another
who
came
up
and
by
and
by
says
the
who
was
reading
a
newspaper
that
had
just
come
some
news
for
you
sands
i
do
believe
there
are
three
vessels
come
into
boston
harbor
that
have
been
out
whaling
and
sealing
in
the
south
seas
for
three
or
four
years
and
your
son
matthew
name
is
down
on
the
list
of
the
crew
tell
ye
says
took
that
paper
and
i
got
on
my
horse
and
put
for
home
and
your
grandmother
she
hailed
me
and
she
said
you
heard
have
you
before
i
told
her
a
word
he
got
his
breakfast
and
started
right
off
for
boston
and
got
there
early
the
second
day
and
went
right
down
on
the
wharves
somebody
lent
him
a
boat
and
he
went
out
to
where
there
were
two
sealers
laying
off
riding
at
anchor
and
he
asked
a
sailor
if
matthew
was
aboard
ay
says
the
sailor
down
below
and
he
sung
out
for
him
and
when
he
come
up
out
of
the
hold
his
hair
was
long
down
over
his
shoulders
like
a
horse
mane
just
as
his
mother
saw
it
in
the
dream
he
did
know
what
to
say
it
scared
him
and
he
asked
how
it
happened
and
father
told
how
they
been
off
sealing
in
the
south
seas
and
he
and
another
man
had
lived
alone
on
an
island
for
months
and
the
whole
crew
had
grown
wild
in
their
ways
of
living
being
off
so
long
and
for
one
thing
had
gone
without
caps
and
let
their
hair
grow
the
rest
of
the
men
had
been
ashore
and
got
fixed
up
smart
but
he
had
been
busy
and
had
put
it
off
till
that
morning
he
was
just
going
ashore
then
father
was
all
struck
up
when
he
heard
about
the
dream
and
said
his
mind
had
been
dwellin
on
his
mother
and
going
home
and
he
come
down
to
let
her
see
him
just
as
he
was
and
she
said
it
was
the
same
way
he
looked
in
the
dream
he
never
would
have
his
hair
cut
father
would
and
wore
it
in
a
queue
i
remember
seeing
him
with
it
when
i
was
a
boy
but
his
second
wife
did
like
the
looks
of
it
and
she
come
up
behind
him
one
day
and
cut
it
off
with
the
scissors
he
was
terrible
worked
up
about
it
i
never
see
father
so
mad
as
he
was
that
day
now
this
is
just
as
true
as
the
bible
said
captain
sands
i
have
put
a
word
to
it
and
told
a
story
just
as
it
was
that
woman
saw
her
son
but
if
you
ask
me
what
kind
of
eyesight
it
was
i
tell
you
nor
nobody
else
later
that
evening
kate
and
i
drifted
into
a
long
talk
about
the
captain
stories
and
these
mysterious
powers
of
which
we
know
so
little
it
was
somewhat
chilly
in
the
house
and
we
had
kindled
a
fire
in
the
fireplace
which
at
first
made
a
blaze
which
lighted
the
old
room
royally
and
then
quieted
down
into
red
coals
and
lazy
puffs
of
smoke
we
had
carried
the
lights
away
and
sat
with
our
feet
on
the
fender
and
kate
great
dog
was
lying
between
us
on
the
rug
i
remember
that
evening
so
well
we
could
see
the
stars
through
the
window
plainer
and
plainer
as
the
fire
went
down
and
we
could
hear
the
noise
of
the
sea
do
you
remember
in
the
old
myth
of
demeter
and
persephone
kate
asked
me
where
demeter
takes
care
of
the
child
and
gives
it
ambrosia
and
hides
it
in
fire
because
she
loves
it
and
wishes
to
make
it
immortal
and
to
give
it
eternal
youth
and
then
the
mother
finds
it
out
and
cries
in
terror
to
hinder
her
and
the
goddess
angrily
throws
the
child
down
and
rushes
away
and
he
had
to
share
the
common
destiny
of
mankind
though
he
always
had
some
wonderful
inscrutable
grace
and
wisdom
because
a
goddess
had
loved
him
and
held
him
in
her
arms
i
always
thought
that
part
of
the
story
beautiful
where
demeter
throws
off
her
disguise
and
is
no
longer
an
old
woman
and
the
great
house
is
filled
with
brightness
like
lightning
and
she
rushes
out
through
the
halls
with
her
yellow
hair
waving
over
her
shoulders
and
the
people
would
give
anything
to
bring
her
back
again
and
to
undo
their
mistake
i
knew
it
almost
all
by
heart
once
said
kate
and
i
am
always
finding
a
new
meaning
in
it
i
was
just
thinking
that
it
may
be
that
we
all
have
given
to
us
more
or
less
of
another
nature
as
the
child
had
whom
demeter
wished
to
make
like
the
gods
i
believe
old
captain
sands
is
right
and
we
have
these
instincts
which
defy
all
our
wisdom
and
for
which
we
never
can
frame
any
laws
we
may
laugh
at
them
but
we
are
always
meeting
them
and
one
can
not
help
knowing
that
it
has
been
the
same
through
all
history
they
are
powers
which
are
imperfectly
developed
in
this
life
but
one
can
not
help
the
thought
that
the
mystery
of
this
world
may
be
the
commonplace
of
the
next
i
wonder
said
i
why
it
is
that
one
hears
so
much
more
of
such
things
from
simple
country
people
they
believe
in
dreams
and
they
have
a
kind
of
fetichism
and
believe
so
heartily
in
supernatural
causes
i
suppose
nothing
could
shake
patton
faith
in
warnings
there
is
no
end
of
absurdity
in
it
and
yet
there
is
one
side
of
such
lives
for
which
one
can
not
help
having
reverence
they
live
so
much
nearer
to
nature
than
people
who
are
in
cities
and
there
is
a
soberness
about
country
people
oftentimes
that
one
can
not
help
noticing
i
wonder
if
they
are
unconsciously
awed
by
the
strength
and
purpose
in
the
world
about
them
and
the
mysterious
creative
power
which
is
at
work
with
them
on
their
familiar
farms
in
their
simple
life
they
take
their
instincts
for
truths
and
perhaps
they
are
not
always
so
far
wrong
as
we
imagine
because
they
are
so
instinctive
and
unreasoning
they
may
have
a
more
complete
sympathy
with
nature
and
may
hear
her
voices
when
wiser
ears
are
deaf
they
have
much
in
common
after
all
with
the
plants
which
grow
up
out
of
the
ground
and
the
wild
creatures
which
depend
upon
their
instincts
wholly
i
think
said
kate
that
the
more
one
lives
out
of
doors
the
more
personality
there
seems
to
be
in
what
we
call
inanimate
things
the
strength
of
the
hills
and
the
voice
of
the
waves
are
no
longer
only
grand
poetical
sentences
but
an
expression
of
something
real
and
more
and
more
one
finds
god
himself
in
the
world
and
believes
that
we
may
read
the
thoughts
that
he
writes
for
us
in
the
book
of
nature
and
after
this
we
were
silent
for
a
while
and
in
the
mean
time
it
grew
very
late
and
we
watched
the
fire
until
there
were
only
a
few
sparks
left
in
the
ashes
the
stars
faded
away
and
the
moon
came
up
out
of
the
sea
and
we
barred
the
great
hall
door
and
went
up
stairs
to
bed
the
lighthouse
lamp
burned
steadily
and
it
was
the
only
light
that
had
not
been
blown
out
in
all
deephaven
i
am
sure
that
kate
lancaster
and
i
must
have
spent
by
far
the
greater
part
of
the
summer
out
of
doors
we
often
made
long
expeditions
out
into
the
suburbs
of
deephaven
sometimes
being
gone
all
day
and
sometimes
taking
a
long
afternoon
stroll
and
coming
home
early
in
the
evening
hungry
as
hunters
and
laden
with
treasure
whether
we
had
been
through
the
pine
woods
inland
or
alongshore
whether
we
had
met
old
friends
or
made
some
desirable
new
acquaintances
we
had
a
fashion
of
calling
at
the
and
by
the
end
of
the
season
we
knew
as
many
people
as
if
we
had
lived
in
deephaven
all
our
days
we
used
to
ask
for
a
drink
of
water
this
was
our
unfailing
introduction
and
afterward
there
were
many
interesting
subjects
which
one
could
introduce
and
we
could
always
give
the
latest
news
at
the
shore
it
was
amusing
to
see
the
curiosity
which
we
aroused
many
of
the
people
came
into
deephaven
only
on
special
occasions
and
i
must
confess
that
at
first
we
were
often
naughty
enough
to
wait
until
we
had
been
severely
before
we
gave
a
definite
account
of
ourselves
kate
was
very
clever
at
making
unsatisfactory
answers
when
she
cared
to
do
so
we
did
not
understand
for
some
time
with
what
a
keen
sense
of
enjoyment
many
of
those
people
made
the
acquaintance
of
an
entirely
new
person
who
cordially
gave
the
full
particulars
about
herself
but
we
soon
learned
to
call
this
by
another
name
than
impertinence
i
think
there
were
no
points
of
interest
in
that
region
which
we
did
not
visit
with
conscientious
faithfulness
there
were
cliffs
and
the
long
sands
and
the
short
sands
there
were
black
rock
and
roaring
rock
high
point
and
east
point
and
spouting
rock
we
went
to
see
where
a
ship
had
been
driven
ashore
in
the
night
all
hands
being
lost
and
not
a
piece
of
her
left
larger
than
an
we
visited
the
spot
where
a
ship
had
come
ashore
in
the
fog
and
had
been
left
high
and
dry
on
the
edge
of
the
marsh
when
the
tide
went
out
we
saw
where
the
brig
methuselah
had
been
wrecked
and
the
shore
had
been
golden
with
her
cargo
of
lemons
and
oranges
which
one
might
carry
away
by
the
wherryful
inland
there
were
not
many
noted
localities
but
we
used
to
enjoy
the
woods
and
our
explorations
among
the
farms
immensely
to
the
westward
the
land
was
better
and
the
people
but
we
went
oftenest
toward
the
hills
and
among
the
poorer
people
the
land
was
uneven
and
full
of
ledges
and
the
people
worked
hard
for
their
living
at
most
laying
aside
only
a
few
dollars
each
year
some
of
the
more
enterprising
young
people
went
away
to
work
in
shops
and
factories
but
the
custom
was
by
no
means
universal
and
the
people
had
a
hungry
discouraged
look
it
is
all
very
well
to
say
that
they
knew
nothing
better
that
it
was
the
only
life
of
which
they
knew
anything
there
was
too
often
a
look
of
disappointment
in
their
faces
and
sooner
or
later
we
heard
or
guessed
many
stories
that
this
young
man
had
wished
for
an
education
but
there
had
been
no
money
to
spare
for
books
or
schooling
and
that
one
had
meant
to
learn
a
trade
but
there
must
be
some
one
to
help
his
father
with
the
and
there
was
no
money
to
hire
a
man
to
work
in
his
place
if
he
went
away
the
older
people
had
a
hard
look
as
if
they
had
always
to
be
on
the
alert
and
must
fight
for
their
place
in
the
world
one
could
only
forgive
and
pity
their
petty
sharpness
which
showed
itself
in
trifling
bargains
when
one
understood
how
much
a
single
dollar
seemed
where
dollars
came
so
rarely
we
used
to
pity
the
young
girls
so
much
it
was
plain
that
those
who
knew
how
much
easier
and
pleasanter
our
lives
were
could
not
help
envying
us
there
was
a
high
hill
half
a
dozen
miles
from
deephaven
which
was
known
in
its
region
as
the
mountain
it
was
the
highest
land
anywhere
near
us
and
having
been
told
that
there
was
a
fine
view
from
the
top
one
day
we
went
there
with
tommy
dockum
for
escort
we
overtook
lorimer
the
minister
on
his
way
to
make
parochial
calls
upon
some
members
of
his
parish
who
lived
far
from
church
and
to
our
delight
he
proposed
to
go
with
us
instead
it
was
a
great
satisfaction
to
have
him
for
a
guide
for
he
knew
both
the
country
and
the
people
more
intimately
than
any
one
else
it
was
a
long
climb
to
the
top
of
the
hill
but
not
a
hard
one
the
sky
was
clear
and
there
was
a
fresh
wind
though
we
had
left
none
at
all
at
the
after
lunch
kate
and
i
spread
our
shawls
over
a
fine
cushion
of
and
had
a
long
talk
with
lorimer
about
ancient
and
modern
deephaven
he
always
seemed
as
much
pleased
with
our
enthusiasm
for
the
town
as
if
it
had
been
a
personal
favor
and
compliment
to
himself
i
remember
how
far
we
could
see
that
day
and
how
we
looked
toward
the
blue
mountains
and
then
out
over
the
ocean
deephaven
looked
insignificant
from
that
height
and
distance
and
indeed
the
country
seemed
to
be
mostly
covered
with
the
pointed
tops
of
pines
and
spruces
and
there
were
long
tracts
of
maple
and
beech
woods
with
their
coloring
of
lighter
fresher
green
suppose
we
go
down
now
said
lorimer
long
before
kate
and
i
had
meant
to
propose
such
a
thing
and
our
feeling
was
that
of
dismay
i
should
like
to
take
you
to
make
a
call
with
me
did
you
ever
hear
of
old
mrs
bonny
no
said
we
and
cheerfully
gathered
our
wraps
and
baskets
and
when
tommy
finally
came
panting
up
the
hill
after
we
had
begun
to
think
that
our
shoutings
and
whistling
were
useless
we
sent
him
down
to
the
horses
and
went
down
ourselves
by
another
path
it
led
us
a
long
distance
through
a
grove
of
young
beeches
the
last
year
whitish
leaves
lay
thick
on
the
ground
and
the
new
leaves
made
so
close
a
roof
overhead
that
the
light
was
strangely
purple
as
if
it
had
come
through
a
great
church
window
of
stained
glass
after
this
we
went
through
some
hemlock
growth
where
on
the
lower
branches
the
pale
green
of
the
new
shoots
and
the
dark
green
of
the
old
made
an
exquisite
contrast
each
to
the
other
finally
we
came
out
at
bonny
lorimer
had
told
us
something
about
her
on
the
way
down
saying
in
the
first
place
that
she
was
one
of
the
queerest
characters
he
knew
her
husband
used
to
be
a
and
and
she
used
to
sell
butter
and
berries
and
eggs
and
preserved
in
molasses
she
always
came
down
to
deephaven
on
a
little
black
horse
with
her
goods
in
baskets
and
bags
which
were
fastened
to
the
saddle
in
a
mysterious
way
she
had
the
reputation
of
not
being
a
neat
housekeeper
and
none
of
the
wise
women
of
the
town
would
touch
her
butter
especially
so
it
was
always
a
joke
when
she
coaxed
a
new
resident
or
a
strange
shipmaster
into
buying
her
wares
but
the
old
woman
always
managed
to
jog
home
without
the
freight
she
had
brought
she
must
be
very
old
now
said
lorimer
i
have
not
seen
her
in
a
long
time
it
can
not
be
possible
that
her
horse
is
still
alive
and
we
all
laughed
when
we
saw
bonny
steed
at
a
little
distance
for
the
shaggy
old
creature
was
covered
with
mud
and
dead
leaves
with
half
the
last
year
in
all
deephaven
snarled
into
his
mane
and
tail
and
sprinkled
over
his
fur
which
looked
nearly
as
long
as
a
buffalo
he
had
hurt
his
leg
and
his
kind
mistress
had
tied
it
up
with
a
piece
of
faded
red
calico
and
an
end
of
ragged
rope
he
gave
us
a
civil
neigh
and
looked
at
us
curiously
then
an
impertinent
little
dog
with
one
ear
standing
up
straight
and
the
other
drooping
over
began
to
bark
with
all
his
might
but
he
retreated
when
he
saw
kate
great
dog
who
was
walking
solemnly
by
her
side
and
did
not
deign
to
notice
him
just
now
bonny
appeared
at
the
door
of
the
house
shading
her
eyes
with
her
hand
to
see
who
was
coming
landy
said
she
if
it
ai
old
parson
lorimer
and
who
be
these
with
ye
this
is
miss
kate
lancaster
of
boston
miss
katharine
brandon
niece
and
her
friend
miss
denis
pleased
to
see
ye
said
the
old
woman
walk
in
and
lay
off
your
things
and
we
followed
her
into
the
house
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
her
she
wore
a
man
coat
cut
off
so
that
it
made
an
odd
short
jacket
and
a
pair
of
men
boots
much
the
worse
for
wear
also
some
short
skirts
beside
two
or
three
aprons
the
inner
one
being
a
as
she
took
off
the
outer
ones
and
threw
them
into
a
corner
and
on
her
head
was
a
tight
cap
with
strings
to
tie
under
her
chin
i
thought
it
was
a
nightcap
and
that
she
had
forgotten
to
take
it
off
and
dreaded
her
mortification
if
she
should
suddenly
become
conscious
of
it
but
i
need
not
have
troubled
myself
for
while
we
were
with
her
she
pulled
it
on
and
tied
it
tighter
as
if
she
considered
it
ornamental
there
were
only
two
rooms
in
the
house
we
went
into
the
kitchen
which
was
occupied
by
a
flock
of
hens
and
one
turkey
the
latter
was
evidently
undergoing
a
course
of
medical
treatment
behind
the
stove
and
was
allowed
to
stay
with
us
while
the
hens
were
remorselessly
hustled
out
with
a
hemlock
broom
they
all
congregated
on
the
doorstep
apparently
wishing
to
hear
everything
that
was
said
ben
up
on
the
mountain
asked
our
hostess

sightly

a
great

when

an
awful
old
thief

he
no
idea
of

else
i
to

makin
to
the
lord
if
anybody

ai
to

ca
bear
to
see
folks
so
pious
to
meeting
and
cheat
yer
out
monday
morning
well
there
we
ai
none
of
us
perfect
even
old
parson
moody
was
they
say
you
were
speaking
of
the
becketts
just
now
said
lorimer
after
we
had
stopped
laughing
and
bonny
had
settled
her
big
spectacles
and
sat
looking
at
him
with
an
expression
of
extreme
wisdom
one
might
have
ventured
to
call
her
peart
i
think
how
do
they
get
on
i
am
seldom
in
this
region
nowadays
since
reid
has
taken
it
under
his
charge
they
get
along
somehow
or
replied
bonny
they
got
the
best
farm
this
side
of
the
ledge
but
they
dreadful
lazy
and
shiftless
them
young
folks
old
mis
beckett
was
tellin
me
the
other
day
she
that
was
samanthy
barnes
you
know
that
one
of
the
boys
got
fighting
the
other
side
of
the
mountain
and
come
home
with
his
nose
broke
and
a
piece
o
one
ear
bit
off
i
forget
which
ear
it
was
their
mother
is
a
real
clever
willin
woman
and
she
takes
it
to
heart
but
it
no
use
for
her
to
say
anything
mis
beckett
says
she
does
make
my
man
feel
dreadful
to
see
his
brother
folks
carry
on
so
there
says
i
beckett
it
just
such
things
as
we
read
of
scriptur
is
fulfilled
in
the
larter
days
there
shall
be
disobedient
children
this
application
of
the
text
was
too
much
for
us
but
bonny
looked
serious
and
we
did
not
like
to
laugh
two
or
three
of
the
exiled
fowls
had
crept
slyly
in
dodging
underneath
our
chairs
and
had
perched
themselves
behind
the
stove
they
were
creatures
and
just
at
this
minute
one
rash
young
rooster
made
a
manful
attempt
to
crow
do
tell
said
his
mistress
who
rose
in
great
wrath
you
need
be
so
as
i
knows
on
after
this
we
were
urged
to
stay
and
have
some
supper
bonny
assured
us
she
could
pick
a
likely
young
hen
in
no
time
fry
her
with
a
bit
of
pork
and
get
us
up
a
good
meat
tea
but
we
had
to
disappoint
her
as
we
had
some
distance
to
walk
to
the
house
where
we
had
left
our
horses
and
a
long
drive
home
kate
asked
if
she
would
be
kind
enough
to
lend
us
a
tumbler
for
ours
was
in
the
basket
which
was
given
into
tommy
charge
we
were
thirsty
and
would
like
to
go
back
to
the
spring
and
get
some
water
yes
dear
said
bonny
i
got
a
glass
if
it
so
i
can
find
it
and
she
pulled
a
chair
under
the
little
cupboard
over
the
fireplace
mounted
it
and
opened
the
door
several
things
fell
out
at
her
and
after
taking
a
careful
survey
she
went
in
head
and
shoulders
until
i
thought
that
she
would
disappear
altogether
but
soon
she
came
back
and
reaching
in
took
out
one
treasure
after
another
putting
them
on
the
or
dropping
them
on
the
floor
there
were
some
bunches
of
dried
herbs
a
tin
horn
a
lump
of
tallow
in
a
broken
plate
a
newspaper
and
an
old
boot
with
a
number
of
tied
together
several
bottles
and
a
steel
trap
and
finally
such
a
tumbler
which
she
produced
with
triumph
before
stepping
down
she
poured
out
of
it
on
the
table
a
mixture
of
old
buttons
and
beside
a
lump
of
beeswax
which
she
said
she
had
lost
and
now
pocketed
with
satisfaction
she
wiped
the
tumbler
on
her
apron
and
handed
it
to
kate
but
we
were
not
so
thirsty
as
we
had
been
though
we
thanked
her
and
went
down
to
the
spring
coming
back
as
soon
as
possible
for
we
could
not
lose
a
bit
of
the
conversation
there
was
a
beautiful
view
from
the
doorstep
and
we
stopped
a
minute
there
real
sightly
ai
it
said
bonny
but
you
ought
to
be
here
and
look
across
the
woods
some
morning
just
at
why
the
sky
is
all
yaller
and
red
and
them
low
lands
topped
with
fog
yes
nice
weather
good
growin
weather
this
week
corn
and
all
the
rest
of
the
trade
looks
i
call
it
a
forrard
season
it
just
such
weather
as
we
read
of
ai
it
i
do
remember
where
just
at
this
moment
said
lorimer
why
in
the
almanac
bless
ye
said
she
with
a
tone
of
pity
in
her
grum
voice
could
it
be
possible
he
did
know
the
deephaven
minister
we
asked
her
to
come
and
see
us
she
said
she
had
always
thought
get
a
chance
some
time
to
see
miss
katharine
brandon
house
she
should
be
pleased
to
call
and
she
did
know
but
she
should
be
down
to
the
shore
before
very
long
she
was
to
look
so
that
day
but
she
had
some
good
clothes
in
a
chist
in
the
bedroom
and
a
boughten
bonnet
with
a
good
cypress
veil
which
she
had
when
he
died
she
calculated
they
would
do
though
they
might
be
some
she
seemed
greatly
pleased
at
lorimer
having
taken
the
trouble
to
come
to
see
her
all
those
people
had
a
great
reverence
for
the
minister
we
were
urged
to
come
again
in
rosbry
time
which
was
near
at
hand
and
she
gave
us
messages
for
some
of
her
old
customers
and
acquaintances
i
believe
some
of
those
old
creatur
will
never
die
said
she
why
they
getting
to
be
old
ai
they
lorimer
there
ye
done
me
a
sight
of
good
and
i
wish
i
could
found
the
bible
to
hear
ye
read
a
psalm
when
lorimer
shook
hands
with
her
at
leaving
she
made
him
a
most
reverential
courtesy
he
was
the
greatest
man
she
knew
and
once
during
the
call
when
he
was
speaking
of
serious
things
in
his
simple
earnest
way
she
had
so
devout
a
look
and
seemed
so
interested
that
kate
and
i
and
lorimer
himself
caught
a
new
fresh
meaning
in
the
familiar
words
he
spoke
living
there
in
the
lonely
clearing
deep
in
the
woods
and
far
from
any
neighbor
she
knew
all
the
herbs
and
trees
and
the
harmless
wild
creatures
who
lived
among
them
by
heart
and
she
had
an
amazing
store
of
tradition
and
superstition
which
made
her
so
entertaining
to
us
that
we
went
to
see
her
many
times
before
we
came
away
in
the
autumn
we
went
with
her
to
find
some
one
day
and
it
was
wonderful
how
much
she
knew
about
the
woods
what
keen
observation
she
had
there
was
something
so
wild
and
unconventional
about
bonny
that
it
was
like
taking
an
afternoon
walk
with
a
indian
we
used
to
carry
her
offerings
of
tobacco
for
she
was
a
great
smoker
and
advised
us
to
try
it
if
ever
we
should
be
troubled
with
nerves
or
narves
as
she
pronounced
the
name
of
that
affliction
soon
after
we
went
to
deephaven
we
took
a
long
drive
one
day
with
dockum
the
kindest
and
silentest
of
men
he
had
the
care
of
the
brandon
property
and
had
some
business
at
that
time
connected
with
a
large
tract
of
perhaps
ten
miles
from
town
we
had
heard
of
the
which
led
to
it
how
rocky
and
how
rough
and
wild
it
was
and
when
kate
heard
by
chance
that
dockum
meant
to
go
that
way
she
asked
if
we
might
go
with
him
he
said
he
would
much
rather
take
us
than
go
sole
alone
but
he
should
be
away
until
late
and
we
must
take
our
dinner
which
we
did
not
mind
doing
at
all
after
we
were
three
or
four
miles
from
deephaven
the
country
looked
very
different
the
shore
was
so
rocky
that
there
were
almost
no
places
where
a
boat
could
put
in
so
there
were
no
fishermen
in
the
region
and
the
farms
were
scattered
wide
apart
the
land
was
so
poor
that
even
the
trees
looked
hungry
at
the
end
of
our
drive
we
left
the
horse
at
a
lonely
little
close
by
the
sea
dockum
was
to
walk
a
long
way
inland
through
the
woods
with
a
man
whom
he
had
come
to
meet
and
he
told
us
if
we
followed
the
shore
westward
a
mile
or
two
we
should
find
some
very
high
rocks
for
which
he
knew
we
had
a
great
liking
it
was
a
delightful
day
to
spend
out
of
doors
there
was
an
occasional
whiff
of
seeing
us
seemed
to
be
a
perfect
godsend
to
the
people
whose
nearest
neighbors
lived
far
out
of
sight
we
had
a
long
talk
with
them
before
we
went
for
our
walk
the
house
was
close
by
the
water
by
a
narrow
cove
around
which
the
rocks
were
low
but
farther
down
the
shore
the
land
rose
more
and
more
and
at
last
we
stood
at
the
edge
of
the
highest
rocks
of
all
and
looked
far
down
at
the
sea
dashing
its
white
spray
high
over
the
ledges
that
quiet
day
what
could
it
be
in
winter
when
there
was
a
storm
and
the
great
waves
came
thundering
in
after
we
had
explored
the
shore
to
our
hearts
content
and
were
tired
we
rested
for
a
while
in
the
shadow
of
some
gnarled
which
stood
close
together
as
near
the
sea
as
they
dared
they
looked
like
a
band
of
outlaws
they
were
such
trees
they
seemed
very
old
and
as
if
their
savage
fights
with
the
winter
winds
had
made
them
and
yet
the
little
and
the
thin
green
were
growing
fearlessly
close
around
their
feet
and
there
were
some
comfortable
in
safe
corners
of
their
rough
branches
when
we
went
back
to
the
house
at
the
cove
we
had
to
wait
some
time
for
dockum
we
succeeded
in
making
friends
with
the
children
and
gave
them
some
candy
and
the
rest
of
our
lunch
which
luckily
had
been
even
more
abundant
than
usual
they
looked
thin
and
pitiful
but
even
in
that
lonely
place
where
they
so
seldom
saw
a
stranger
or
even
a
neighbor
they
showed
that
there
was
an
evident
effort
to
make
them
look
like
other
children
and
they
were
neatly
dressed
though
there
could
be
no
mistake
about
their
being
very
poor
one
forlorn
little
soul
with
honest
gray
eyes
and
a
sweet
shy
smile
showed
us
a
string
of
beads
which
she
wore
round
her
neck
there
were
perhaps
two
dozen
of
them
blue
and
white
on
a
bit
of
twine
and
they
were
the
dearest
things
in
all
her
world
when
we
came
away
we
were
so
glad
that
we
could
give
the
man
more
than
he
asked
us
for
taking
care
of
the
horse
and
his
thanks
touched
us
i
hope
ye
may
never
know
what
it
is
to
earn
every
dollar
as
hard
as
i
have
i
never
earned
any
money
as
easy
as
this
before
i
do
feel
as
if
i
ought
to
take
it
i
done
the
best
i
could
said
the
man
with
the
tears
coming
into
his
eyes
and
a
huskiness
in
his
voice
i
done
the
best
i
could
and
i
willin
and
my
woman
is
but
everything
seems
to
have
been
us
we
never
seem
to
get
forehanded
it
looks
sometimes
as
if
the
lord
had
forgot
us
but
my
woman
she
never
wants
me
to
say
that
she
says
he
ai
and
that
we
might
be
worse
off
but
i
don
know
i
have
had
my
health
that
hendered
me
most
i
a
by
trade
but
the
business
all
run
down
folks
buys
nowadays
and
you
ca
make
nothing
i
ca
stand
it
to
foller
fishing
and
well
you
see
what
my
land
wuth
but
my
oldest
boy
he
getting
ahead
he
pushed
off
this
spring
and
he
works
in
a
to
boston
a
cousin
o
his
mother
got
him
the
chance
he
sent
me
ten
dollars
a
spell
ago
and
his
mother
a
shawl
i
do
see
how
he
done
it
but
he
smart
this
seemed
to
be
the
only
bright
spot
in
their
lives
and
we
admired
the
shawl
and
sat
down
in
the
house
awhile
with
the
mother
who
seemed
kind
and
patient
and
tired
and
to
have
great
delight
in
talking
about
what
one
should
wear
kate
and
i
thought
and
spoke
often
of
these
people
afterward
and
when
one
day
we
met
the
man
in
deephaven
we
sent
some
things
to
the
children
and
his
wife
and
begged
him
to
come
to
the
house
whenever
he
came
to
town
but
we
never
saw
him
again
and
though
we
made
many
plans
for
going
again
to
the
cove
we
never
did
at
one
time
the
road
was
reported
impassable
and
we
put
off
our
second
excursion
for
this
reason
and
others
until
just
before
we
left
deephaven
late
in
october
we
knew
the
would
be
bad
after
the
fall
rains
and
we
found
that
leander
the
eldest
of
the
dockum
boys
had
some
errand
that
way
so
he
went
with
us
we
enjoyed
the
drive
that
morning
in
spite
of
the
rough
road
the
air
was
warm
and
sweet
with
the
smell
of
and
and
the
delicious
saltness
of
the
sea
which
was
not
far
from
us
all
the
way
it
was
a
perfect
autumn
day
sometimes
we
crossed
pebble
beaches
and
then
went
farther
inland
through
woods
and
up
and
down
steep
little
hills
over
shaky
bridges
which
crossed
narrow
salt
creeks
in
the
there
was
a
little
excitement
about
the
drive
and
an
exhilaration
in
the
air
and
we
laughed
at
jokes
forgotten
the
next
minute
and
sang
and
were
jolly
enough
leander
who
had
never
happened
to
see
us
in
exactly
this
hilarious
state
of
mind
before
seemed
surprised
and
interested
and
became
unusually
talkative
telling
us
a
great
many
edifying
particulars
about
the
people
whose
houses
we
passed
and
who
owned
every
along
the
road
do
you
see
that
house
over
on
the
he
asked
an
old
fellow
lives
there
that
part
lost
his
mind
he
had
a
son
who
was
drowned
off
cod
rock
fishing
much
as
years
ago
and
worn
a
deep
path
out
to
the
end
of
the
where
he
goes
out
every
hand
turn
o
the
day
to
see
if
he
ca
see
the
boat
coming
in
and
leander
looked
round
to
see
if
we
were
not
amused
and
seemed
puzzled
because
we
did
laugh
happily
his
next
story
was
funny
we
saw
a
sleepy
little
owl
on
the
dead
branch
of
a
we
saw
a
rabbit
cross
the
road
and
disappear
in
a
clump
of
juniper
and
squirrels
run
up
and
down
trees
and
along
the
with
acorns
in
their
mouths
we
passed
straggling
thickets
of
the
upland
sumach
leafless
and
holding
high
their
ungainly
spikes
of
red
berries
there
were
sturdy
along
the
lonely
wayside
their
unpicked
fruit
hanging
in
brilliant
clusters
the
made
patches
of
dull
red
along
the
hillsides
the
ferns
were
and
brown
at
the
edges
of
the
woods
and
the
asters
and
which
had
lately
looked
so
gay
in
the
open
fields
stood
now
in
faded
companies
there
were
busy
flocks
of
birds
flitting
from
field
to
field
ready
to
start
on
their
journey
southward
when
we
reached
the
house
to
our
surprise
there
was
no
one
in
sight
and
the
place
looked
deserted
we
left
the
wagon
and
while
leander
went
toward
the
barn
which
stood
at
a
little
distance
kate
and
i
went
to
the
house
and
knocked
i
opened
the
door
a
little
way
and
said
hallo
but
nobody
answered
the
people
could
not
have
moved
away
for
there
were
some
chairs
standing
outside
the
door
and
as
i
looked
in
i
saw
the
bunches
of
herbs
hanging
up
and
a
trace
of
corn
and
the
furniture
was
all
there
it
was
a
great
disappointment
for
we
had
counted
upon
seeing
the
children
again
leander
said
there
was
nobody
at
the
barn
and
that
they
must
have
gone
to
a
funeral
he
could
think
of
anything
else
just
now
we
saw
some
people
coming
up
the
road
and
we
thought
at
first
that
they
were
the
man
and
his
wife
coming
back
but
they
proved
to
be
strangers
and
we
eagerly
asked
what
had
become
of
the
family
they
dead
both
on
his
wife
she
died
about
nine
weeks
ago
last
sunday
and
he
died
day
before
yesterday
funeral
going
to
be
this
afternoon
thought
ye
were
some
of
her
folks
from
up
country
when
we
were
coming
along
said
the
man
guess
they
wo
come
nigh
said
the
woman
scornfully
they
have
to
help
provide
for
the
children
i
was
to
him
and
i
got
to
take
the
two
least
ones
did
you
say
he
was
going
to
be
buried
this
afternoon
asked
kate
slowly
we
were
both
more
startled
than
i
can
tell
yes
said
the
man
who
seemed
much
than
his
wife
she
appeared
like
a
person
whose
only
aim
in
life
was
to
have
things
over
with
yes
we
going
to
bury
at
two
they
had
a
master
sight
of
trouble
first
and
last
leander
had
said
nothing
all
this
time
he
had
known
the
man
and
had
expected
to
spend
the
day
with
him
and
to
get
him
to
go
on
two
miles
farther
to
help
bargain
for
a
dory
he
asked
in
a
disappointed
way
what
had
carried
him
off
so
sudden
drink
said
the
woman
relentlessly
he
ai
been
good
for
nothing
sence
his
wife
died
she
was
took
with
a
fever
along
in
the
first
of
august
ha
got
up
from
it
now
do
be
hard
on
the
dead
marthy
said
her
husband
i
guess
they
done
the
best
they
could
they
were
you
know
they
never
had
no
health
was
against
wind
and
tide
with
all
the
time
and
kate
asked
did
you
say
he
was
your
brother
yes
i
was
to
him
said
the
woman
promptly
with
perfect
unconsciousness
of
kate
meaning
and
what
will
become
of
those
poor
children
i
got
the
two
youngest
over
to
my
place
to
take
care
on
and
the
two
next
them
has
been
put
out
to
some
folks
over
to
the
cove
i
dare
say
like
not
they
be
sent
back
they
clever
i
guess
said
the
man
who
spoke
as
if
this
were
the
first
time
he
had
dared
take
their
part
do
be
marthy
who
knows
but
they
may
do
for
us
when
we
get
to
be
old
and
then
she
turned
and
looked
at
him
with
utter
contempt
i
ca
stand
it
to
hear
talking
on
what
they
do
know
nothing
about
said
she
the
ways
of
providence
is
dreadful
she
went
on
with
a
whine
instead
of
the
sharp
tone
of
voice
which
we
had
heard
before
we
had
a
hard
row
and
we
just
got
our
own
children
off
our
hands
and
able
to
do
for
themselves
and
now
here
are
these
to
be
fetched
up
but
perhaps
they
be
a
help
to
you
they
seem
to
be
good
little
things
said
kate
i
saw
them
in
the
summer
and
they
seemed
to
be
pleasant
children
and
it
is
dreadfully
hard
for
them
to
be
left
alone
it
not
their
fault
you
know
we
brought
over
something
for
them
will
you
be
kind
enough
to
take
the
basket
when
you
go
home
thank
ye
i
sure
said
the
aunt
relenting
slightly
you
can
speak
to
my
man
about
it
and
he
give
it
to
somebody
that
going
by
got
to
walk
in
the
procession
they
be
obliged
i
sure
i
you
the
young
ladies
that
come
here
right
after
the
fourth
o
july
ai
you
i
should
be
pleased
to
have
you
call
and
see
the
if
you
over
this
way
again
i
heard
talk
about
you
last
time
i
was
over
wo
ye
step
into
the
house
and
see
him
he
looks
real
natural
she
added
but
we
said
no
thank
you
leander
told
us
he
believed
he
would
bother
about
the
dory
that
day
and
he
should
be
there
at
the
house
whenever
we
were
ready
he
evidently
considered
it
a
piece
of
good
luck
that
he
had
happened
to
arrive
in
time
for
the
funeral
we
spoke
to
the
man
about
the
things
we
had
brought
for
the
children
which
seemed
to
delight
him
poor
soul
and
we
felt
sure
he
would
be
kind
to
them
his
wife
shouted
to
him
from
a
window
of
the
house
that
he
better
not
loiter
round
or
they
be
half
ready
when
the
folks
began
to
come
and
we
said
good
by
to
him
and
went
away
it
was
a
beautiful
morning
and
we
walked
slowly
along
the
shore
to
the
high
rocks
and
the
trees
which
we
had
seen
before
the
air
was
deliciously
fresh
and
one
could
take
long
deep
breaths
of
it
the
tide
was
coming
in
and
the
spray
dashed
higher
and
higher
we
climbed
about
the
rocks
and
went
down
in
some
of
the
deep
cold
clefts
into
which
the
sun
could
seldom
shine
we
gathered
some
bits
of
pimpernel
and
one
or
two
sprigs
of
fringed
gentian
which
had
bloomed
late
in
a
sheltered
place
and
a
pale
little
bouquet
of
asters
we
sat
for
a
long
time
looking
off
to
sea
and
we
could
talk
or
think
of
almost
nothing
beside
what
we
had
seen
and
heard
at
the
we
said
how
much
we
should
like
to
go
to
that
funeral
and
we
even
made
up
our
minds
to
go
back
in
season
but
we
gave
up
the
idea
we
had
no
right
there
and
it
would
seem
as
if
we
were
merely
curious
and
we
were
afraid
our
presence
would
make
the
people
ill
at
ease
the
minister
especially
it
would
be
an
intrusion
we
spoke
of
the
children
and
tried
to
think
what
could
be
done
for
them
we
were
afraid
they
would
be
told
so
many
times
that
it
was
lucky
they
did
not
have
to
go
to
the
and
yet
we
could
not
help
pitying
the
discouraged
woman
whom
we
had
seen
in
spite
of
her
bitterness
poor
soul
she
looked
like
a
person
to
whom
nobody
had
ever
been
very
kind
and
for
whom
life
had
no
pleasures
its
sunshine
had
never
been
warm
enough
to
thaw
the
ice
at
her
heart
we
remembered
how
we
knocked
at
the
door
and
called
loudly
but
there
had
been
no
answer
and
we
wondered
how
we
should
have
felt
if
we
had
gone
farther
into
the
room
and
had
found
the
dead
man
in
his
coffin
all
alone
in
the
house
we
thought
of
our
first
visit
and
what
he
had
said
to
us
and
we
wished
we
had
come
again
sooner
for
we
might
have
helped
them
so
much
more
if
we
had
only
known
what
a
pitiful
ending
it
is
said
kate
do
you
realize
that
the
family
is
broken
up
and
the
children
are
to
be
half
strangers
to
each
other
did
you
not
notice
that
they
seemed
very
fond
of
each
other
when
we
saw
them
in
the
summer
there
was
not
half
the
roughness
and
apparent
carelessness
of
one
another
which
one
so
often
sees
in
the
country
theirs
was
such
a
little
world
one
can
understand
how
when
the
wife
died
he
was
bewildered
and
discouraged
utterly
at
a
loss
the
thoughts
of
winter
and
of
the
little
children
and
of
the
struggles
he
had
already
come
through
against
poverty
and
disappointment
were
terrible
thoughts
and
like
a
boat
adrift
at
sea
the
waves
of
his
misery
brought
him
in
against
the
rocks
and
his
simple
life
was
wrecked
i
suppose
his
grandest
hopes
and
wishes
would
have
been
realized
in
a
good
farm
and
a
thousand
or
two
dollars
in
safe
keeping
said
i
do
you
remember
that
merry
little
song
in
you
like
it
doth
ambition
shun
and
loves
to
live
i
the
sun
seeking
the
food
he
eats
and
pleased
with
what
he
gets
and
shall
he
see
no
enemy
but
winter
and
rough
weather
that
is
all
he
lived
for
his
literal
daily
bread
i
suppose
what
would
be
prosperity
to
him
would
be
miserably
insufficient
for
some
other
people
i
wonder
how
we
can
help
being
conscious
in
the
midst
of
our
comforts
and
pleasures
of
the
lives
which
are
being
starved
to
death
in
more
ways
than
one
i
suppose
one
thinks
more
about
these
things
as
one
grows
older
said
kate
thoughtfully
how
seldom
life
in
this
world
seems
to
be
a
success
among
rich
or
poor
only
here
and
there
one
touches
satisfaction
though
the
one
who
seems
to
have
made
an
utter
failure
may
really
be
the
greatest
conqueror
and
helen
i
find
that
i
understand
better
and
better
how
unsatisfactory
how
purposeless
and
disastrous
any
life
must
be
which
is
not
a
christian
life
it
is
like
being
always
in
the
dark
and
wandering
one
knows
not
where
if
one
is
not
learning
more
and
more
what
it
is
to
have
a
friendship
with
god
by
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
the
sky
had
grown
cloudy
and
a
wind
seemed
to
be
coming
in
off
the
sea
and
we
unwillingly
decided
that
we
must
go
home
we
supposed
that
the
funeral
would
be
all
over
with
but
found
we
had
been
mistaken
when
we
reached
the
cove
we
seated
ourselves
on
a
rock
near
the
water
just
beside
us
was
the
old
boat
with
its
killick
and
painter
stretched
ashore
where
its
owner
had
left
it
there
were
several
men
standing
around
the
door
of
the
house
looking
solemn
and
important
and
by
and
by
one
of
them
came
over
to
us
and
we
found
out
a
little
more
of
the
sad
story
we
liked
this
man
there
was
so
much
pity
in
his
face
and
voice
he
was
a
real
willin
honest
man
andrew
was
said
our
new
friend
but
he
used
to
be
sickly
and
seemed
to
have
no
luck
though
for
a
year
or
two
he
got
along
some
better
when
his
wife
died
he
was
sore
afflicted
and
could
get
over
it
and
he
did
know
what
to
do
or
what
was
going
to
become
of
with
winter
comin
on
and
well
i
may
well
tell
ye
he
took
to
drink
and
it
killed
him
right
off
i
come
over
two
or
three
times
and
made
some
gruel
and
fixed
him
up
well
i
could
and
the
little
gals
done
the
best
they
could
but
he
faded
right
out
and
did
know
anything
the
last
time
i
see
him
and
he
died
sunday
mornin
when
the
tide
begun
to
ebb
i
always
set
a
good
deal
by
andrew
we
used
to
play
together
down
to
the
great
cove
that
where
he
was
raised
and
my
folks
lived
there
too
i
got
one
o
the
little
gals
i
always
knowed
him
and
his
wife
just
now
we
heard
the
people
in
the
house
singing
china
the
deephaven
funeral
hymn
and
the
tune
suited
well
that
day
with
its
wailing
rise
and
fall
it
was
strangely
plaintive
then
the
funeral
exercises
were
over
and
the
man
with
whom
we
had
just
been
speaking
led
to
the
door
a
horse
and
rickety
wagon
from
which
the
seat
had
been
taken
and
when
the
coffin
had
been
put
in
he
led
the
horse
down
the
road
a
little
way
and
we
watched
the
mourners
come
out
of
the
house
two
by
two
we
heard
some
one
scold
in
a
whisper
because
the
wagon
was
twice
as
far
off
as
it
need
have
been
they
evidently
had
a
rigid
funeral
etiquette
and
felt
it
important
that
everything
should
be
carried
out
according
to
rule
we
saw
a
kitten
with
a
bit
of
faded
braid
round
its
neck
run
across
the
road
in
terror
and
presently
appear
again
on
the
where
she
sat
looking
at
the
people
we
saw
the
dead
eldest
son
of
whom
he
had
told
us
in
the
summer
with
such
pride
he
had
shown
his
respect
for
his
father
as
best
he
could
by
a
black
band
on
his
hat
and
a
pair
of
black
cotton
gloves
a
world
too
large
for
him
he
looked
so
sad
and
cried
bitterly
as
he
stood
alone
at
the
head
of
the
people
his
aunt
was
next
with
a
handkerchief
at
her
eyes
fully
equal
to
the
proprieties
of
the
occasion
though
i
fear
her
grief
was
not
so
heartfelt
as
her
husband
who
dried
his
eyes
on
his
again
and
again
there
were
perhaps
twenty
of
the
mourners
and
there
was
much
whispering
among
those
who
walked
last
the
minister
and
some
others
fell
into
line
and
the
procession
went
slowly
down
the
slope
a
strange
shadow
had
fallen
over
everything
it
was
like
a
november
day
for
the
air
felt
cold
and
bleak
there
were
some
great
high
in
the
air
fighting
their
way
toward
the
sea
against
the
wind
and
giving
now
and
then
a
wild
ringing
cry
we
could
hear
the
dull
sound
of
the
sea
and
at
a
little
distance
from
the
land
the
waves
were
leaping
high
and
breaking
in
white
foam
over
the
isolated
ledges
the
rest
of
the
people
began
to
walk
or
drive
away
but
kate
and
i
stood
watching
the
funeral
as
it
crept
along
the
narrow
crooked
road
we
had
never
seen
what
the
people
called
walking
funerals
until
we
came
to
deephaven
and
there
was
something
piteous
about
this
the
mourners
looked
so
few
and
we
could
hear
the
rattle
of
the
gone
ai
he
said
some
one
near
us
that
was
it
before
the
people
had
entered
the
house
there
had
been
i
am
sure
an
indifferent
look
but
when
they
came
out
all
that
was
changed
their
faces
were
awed
by
the
presence
of
death
and
the
indifference
had
given
place
to
uncertainty
their
neighbor
was
immeasurably
their
superior
now
living
he
had
been
a
failure
by
their
own
low
standards
but
now
if
he
could
come
back
he
would
know
secrets
and
be
wise
beyond
anything
they
could
imagine
and
who
could
know
the
riches
of
which
he
might
have
come
into
possession
to
kate
and
me
there
came
a
sudden
consciousness
of
the
mystery
and
inevitableness
of
death
it
was
not
fear
thank
god
but
a
thought
of
how
certain
it
was
that
some
day
it
would
be
a
mystery
to
us
no
longer
and
there
was
a
thought
too
of
the
limitation
of
this
present
life
we
were
waiting
there
in
company
with
the
people
the
great
sea
and
the
rocks
and
fields
themselves
on
this
side
the
boundary
we
knew
just
then
how
close
to
this
familiar
world
might
be
the
other
which
at
times
before
had
seemed
so
far
away
out
of
reach
of
even
our
thoughts
beyond
the
distant
stars
we
stayed
awhile
longer
until
the
little
black
funeral
had
crawled
out
of
sight
until
we
had
seen
the
last
funeral
guest
go
away
and
the
door
had
been
shut
and
fastened
with
a
queer
old
padlock
and
some
links
of
rusty
chain
the
door
fitted
loosely
and
the
man
gave
it
a
vindictive
shake
as
if
he
thought
that
the
poor
house
had
somehow
been
to
blame
and
that
after
a
long
desperate
struggle
for
life
under
its
roof
and
among
the
stony
fields
the
family
must
go
away
defeated
it
is
not
likely
that
any
one
else
will
ever
go
to
live
there
the
man
to
whom
the
farm
was
mortgaged
will
add
the
few
forlorn
acres
to
his
and
the
thistles
which
the
man
who
is
dead
had
fought
so
many
years
will
march
in
next
summer
and
take
unmolested
possession
i
think
of
that
fireless
empty
forsaken
house
where
the
winter
sun
shines
in
and
creeps
slowly
along
the
floor
the
bitter
cold
is
in
and
around
the
house
and
the
snow
has
sifted
in
at
every
crack
outside
it
is
untrodden
by
any
living
creature
footstep
the
wind
blows
and
rushes
and
shakes
the
loose
in
their
frames
while
the
padlock
knocks
knocks
against
the
door
the
deephaven
people
used
to
say
sometimes
complacently
that
certain
things
or
certain
people
were
as
dull
as
east
parish
kate
and
i
grew
curious
to
see
that
part
of
the
world
which
was
considered
duller
than
deephaven
itself
and
as
upon
inquiry
we
found
that
it
was
not
out
of
reach
one
day
we
went
there
it
was
like
deephaven
only
on
a
smaller
scale
the
village
though
it
is
a
question
whether
that
is
not
an
exaggerated
term
to
apply
had
evidently
seen
better
days
it
was
on
the
bank
of
a
river
and
perhaps
half
a
mile
from
the
sea
there
were
a
few
old
buildings
there
some
with
mossy
roofs
and
a
great
deal
of
yellow
lichen
on
the
sides
of
the
walls
next
the
sea
a
few
newer
houses
belonging
to
fishermen
some
dilapidated
and
a
row
of
every
house
seemed
to
have
a
lane
of
its
own
and
all
faced
different
ways
except
two
which
stood
amiably
side
by
side
there
was
a
church
which
we
had
been
told
was
the
oldest
in
the
region
through
the
windows
we
saw
the
high
pulpit
and
and
finally
found
the
keys
at
a
house
near
by
so
we
went
in
and
looked
around
at
our
leisure
a
rusty
stood
in
one
of
the
old
square
pews
and
in
the
gallery
there
was
a
majestic
with
all
its
strings
snapped
but
the
largest
which
gave
out
a
doleful
sound
when
we
touched
it
after
we
left
the
church
we
walked
along
the
road
a
little
way
and
came
in
sight
of
a
fine
old
house
which
had
apparently
fallen
into
ruin
years
before
the
front
entrance
was
a
fine
specimen
of
workmanship
with
its
columns
and
carvings
and
the
fence
had
been
a
grand
affair
in
its
day
though
now
it
could
scarcely
stand
alone
the
long
range
of
were
falling
piece
by
piece
one
shed
had
been
blown
down
entirely
by
a
late
high
wind
the
large
windows
had
many
panes
of
glass
and
the
great
chimneys
were
built
of
the
bright
red
bricks
which
used
to
be
brought
from
in
the
days
of
the
colonies
we
noticed
the
gnarled
lilacs
in
the
yard
the
wrinkled
and
a
flourishing
company
of
french
pinks
or
bouncing
bets
as
kate
called
them
suppose
we
go
in
said
i
the
door
is
open
a
little
way
there
surely
must
be
some
stories
about
its
being
haunted
we
will
ask
miss
honora
and
we
climbed
over
the
boards
which
were
put
up
like
across
the
wide
front
gateway
we
shall
certainly
meet
a
ghost
said
kate
just
as
we
stood
on
the
steps
the
door
was
pulled
wide
open
we
started
back
and
young
women
as
we
are
we
have
confessed
since
that
our
first
impulse
was
to
run
away
on
the
threshold
there
stood
a
stately
old
woman
who
looked
surprised
at
first
sight
of
us
then
quickly
recovered
herself
and
stood
waiting
for
us
to
speak
she
was
dressed
in
a
rusty
black
satin
gown
with
scant
short
skirt
and
huge
sleeves
on
her
head
was
a
great
black
bonnet
with
a
high
crown
and
a
close
brim
which
came
far
out
over
her
face
what
is
your
pleasure
said
she
and
we
felt
like
two
awkward
children
kate
partially
recovered
her
wits
and
asked
which
was
the
nearer
way
to
deephaven
there
is
but
one
road
past
the
church
and
over
the
hill
it
can
not
be
missed
and
she
bowed
gravely
when
we
thanked
her
and
begged
her
pardon
we
hardly
knew
why
and
came
away
we
looked
back
to
see
her
still
standing
in
the
doorway
who
in
the
world
can
she
be
said
kate
and
we
wondered
and
puzzled
and
talked
over
the
ghost
until
we
saw
miss
honora
carew
who
told
us
that
it
was
miss
sally
chauncey
indeed
i
know
her
poor
old
soul
said
miss
honora
she
has
such
a
sad
history
she
is
the
last
survivor
of
one
of
the
most
aristocratic
old
colonial
families
the
chaunceys
were
of
great
renown
until
early
in
the
present
century
and
then
their
fortunes
changed
they
had
always
been
rich
and
and
i
suppose
nobody
ever
had
a
gayer
happier
time
than
miss
sally
did
in
her
girlhood
for
they
entertained
a
great
deal
of
company
and
lived
in
fine
style
but
her
father
was
unfortunate
in
business
and
at
last
was
utterly
ruined
at
the
time
of
the
embargo
then
he
became
partially
insane
and
died
after
many
years
of
poverty
i
have
often
heard
a
tradition
that
a
sailor
to
whom
he
had
broken
a
promise
had
cursed
him
and
that
none
of
the
family
had
died
in
their
beds
or
had
any
good
luck
since
the
east
parish
people
seem
to
believe
in
it
and
it
is
certainly
strange
what
terrible
sorrow
has
come
to
the
chaunceys
one
of
miss
sally
brothers
a
fine
young
officer
in
the
navy
who
was
at
home
on
leave
asked
her
one
day
if
she
could
get
on
without
him
and
she
said
yes
thinking
he
meant
to
go
back
to
sea
but
in
a
few
minutes
she
heard
the
noise
of
a
pistol
in
his
room
and
hurried
in
to
find
him
lying
dead
on
the
floor
then
there
was
another
brother
who
was
insane
and
who
became
so
violent
that
he
was
chained
for
years
in
one
of
the
upper
chambers
a
dangerous
prisoner
i
have
heard
his
horrid
cries
myself
when
i
was
a
young
girl
said
miss
honora
with
a
shiver
miss
sally
is
insane
and
has
been
for
many
years
and
this
seems
to
me
the
saddest
part
of
the
story
when
she
first
lost
her
reason
she
was
sent
to
a
hospital
for
there
was
no
one
who
could
take
care
of
her
the
mania
was
so
acute
that
no
one
had
the
slightest
thought
that
she
would
recover
or
even
live
long
her
guardian
sold
the
furniture
and
pictures
and
china
almost
everything
but
clothing
to
pay
the
bills
at
the
hospital
until
the
house
was
fairly
empty
and
then
one
spring
day
i
remember
it
well
she
came
home
in
her
right
mind
and
without
a
thought
of
what
was
awaiting
her
ran
eagerly
into
her
home
it
was
a
terrible
shock
and
she
never
has
recovered
from
it
though
after
a
long
illness
her
insanity
took
a
mild
form
and
she
has
always
been
perfectly
harmless
she
has
been
alone
many
years
and
no
one
can
persuade
her
to
leave
the
old
house
where
she
seems
to
be
contented
and
does
not
realize
her
troubles
though
she
lives
mostly
in
the
past
and
has
little
idea
of
the
present
except
in
her
house
affairs
which
seem
pitiful
to
me
for
i
remember
the
housekeeping
of
the
chaunceys
when
i
was
a
child
i
have
always
been
to
see
her
and
she
usually
knows
me
though
i
have
been
but
seldom
of
late
years
she
is
several
years
older
than
i
the
town
makes
her
an
allowance
every
year
and
she
has
some
friends
who
take
care
that
she
does
not
suffer
though
her
wants
are
few
she
is
an
elegant
woman
still
and
some
day
if
you
like
i
will
give
you
something
to
carry
to
her
and
a
message
if
i
can
think
of
one
and
you
must
go
to
make
her
a
call
i
hope
she
will
happen
to
be
talkative
for
i
am
sure
you
would
enjoy
her
for
many
years
she
did
not
like
to
see
strangers
but
some
one
has
told
me
lately
that
she
seems
to
be
pleased
if
people
go
to
see
her
you
may
be
sure
it
was
not
many
days
before
kate
and
i
claimed
the
basket
and
the
message
and
went
again
to
east
parish
we
boldly
lifted
the
great
brass
knocker
and
were
dismayed
because
nobody
answered
while
we
waited
a
girl
came
up
the
walk
and
said
that
miss
sally
lived
up
stairs
and
she
would
speak
to
her
if
we
liked
sometimes
she
have
sense
enough
to
know
what
the
knocker
means
we
were
told
there
was
evidently
no
romance
about
miss
sally
to
our
new
acquaintance
do
you
think
said
i
that
we
might
go
in
and
look
around
the
lower
rooms
perhaps
she
will
refuse
to
see
us
yes
indeed
said
the
girl
only
run
the
minute
i
speak
you
have
time
enough
for
she
walks
slow
and
is
a
little
deaf
so
we
went
into
the
great
hall
with
its
wide
staircase
and
handsome
cornices
and
panelling
and
then
into
the
large
parlor
on
the
right
and
through
it
to
a
smaller
room
looking
out
on
the
garden
which
sloped
down
to
the
river
both
rooms
had
fine
carved
mantels
with
fireplaces
and
in
the
cornices
we
saw
the
fastenings
where
pictures
had
hung
old
portraits
perhaps
and
what
had
become
of
them
the
girl
did
not
know
the
house
had
been
the
same
ever
since
she
could
remember
only
it
would
all
fall
through
into
the
cellar
soon
but
the
old
lady
was
proud
as
lucifer
and
would
hear
of
moving
out
the
floor
in
the
room
toward
the
river
was
so
broken
that
it
was
not
safe
and
we
came
back
through
the
hall
and
opened
the
door
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
guess
you
wo
want
to
stop
long
there
said
the
girl
three
old
hens
and
a
rooster
marched
toward
us
with
great
solemnity
when
we
looked
in
the
cobwebs
hung
in
the
room
as
they
often
do
in
old
barns
in
long
gray
festoons
the
lilacs
outside
grew
close
against
the
two
windows
where
the
shutters
were
not
drawn
and
the
light
in
the
room
was
greenish
and
dim
then
we
took
our
places
on
the
threshold
and
the
girl
went
up
stairs
and
announced
us
to
miss
sally
and
in
a
few
minutes
we
heard
her
come
along
the
hall
sophia
said
she
where
are
the
gentry
waiting
and
just
then
she
came
in
sight
round
the
turn
of
the
staircase
she
wore
the
same
great
black
bonnet
and
satin
gown
and
looked
more
and
ghostly
than
before
she
was
not
tall
but
very
erect
in
spite
of
her
great
age
and
her
eyes
seemed
to
look
through
you
in
an
uncanny
way
she
slowly
descended
the
stairs
and
came
toward
us
with
a
courteous
greeting
and
when
we
had
introduced
ourselves
as
miss
carew
friends
she
gave
us
each
her
hand
in
a
most
cordial
way
and
said
she
was
pleased
to
see
us
she
bowed
us
into
the
parlor
and
brought
us
two
rickety
chairs
which
with
an
old
table
were
all
the
furniture
there
was
in
the
room
sit
ye
down
said
she
herself
taking
a
place
in
the
i
have
seen
few
more
elegant
women
than
miss
chauncey
thoroughly
at
her
ease
she
had
the
manner
of
a
lady
of
the
olden
times
using
the
quaint
fashion
of
speech
which
she
had
been
taught
in
her
girlhood
the
long
words
and
ceremonious
phrases
suited
her
extremely
well
her
hands
were
delicately
shaped
and
she
folded
them
in
her
lap
as
no
doubt
she
had
learned
to
do
at
so
many
years
before
she
asked
kate
and
me
if
we
knew
any
young
ladies
at
that
school
in
boston
saying
that
most
of
her
intimate
friends
had
left
when
she
did
but
some
of
the
younger
ones
were
there
still
she
asked
for
the
carews
and
lorimer
and
when
kate
told
her
that
she
was
miss
brandon
niece
and
asked
if
she
had
not
known
her
she
said
certainly
my
dear
we
were
intimate
friends
at
one
time
but
i
have
seen
her
little
of
late
do
you
not
know
that
she
is
dead
asked
kate
ah
they
say
every
one
is
nowadays
i
do
not
comprehend
the
silly
idea
said
the
old
lady
impatiently
it
is
an
excuse
i
suppose
she
could
come
to
see
me
if
she
chose
but
she
was
always
a
ceremonious
body
and
i
go
abroad
but
seldom
now
so
perhaps
she
waits
my
visit
i
will
not
speak
uncourteously
and
you
must
remember
me
to
her
kindly
then
she
asked
us
about
other
old
people
in
deephaven
and
about
families
in
boston
whom
she
had
known
in
her
early
days
i
think
every
one
of
whom
she
spoke
was
dead
but
we
assured
her
that
they
were
all
well
and
prosperous
and
we
hoped
we
told
the
truth
she
asked
about
the
of
men
and
women
who
had
died
old
and
within
our
remembrance
and
finally
she
said
we
must
pardon
her
for
these
tiresome
questions
but
it
was
so
rarely
she
saw
any
one
direct
from
boston
of
whom
she
could
inquire
concerning
these
old
friends
and
relatives
of
her
family
something
happened
after
this
which
touched
us
both
inexpressibly
she
sat
for
some
time
watching
kate
with
a
bewildered
look
which
at
last
faded
away
a
smile
coming
in
its
place
i
think
you
are
like
my
mother
she
said
did
any
one
ever
say
to
you
that
you
are
like
my
mother
will
you
let
me
see
your
forehead
yes
and
your
hair
is
only
a
little
darker
kate
had
risen
when
miss
chauncey
did
and
they
stood
side
by
side
there
was
a
tone
in
the
old
lady
voice
which
brought
the
tears
to
my
eyes
she
stood
there
some
minutes
looking
at
kate
i
wonder
what
her
thoughts
were
there
was
a
kinship
it
seemed
to
me
not
of
blood
only
that
they
both
were
of
the
same
stamp
and
rank
miss
chauncey
of
the
old
generation
and
kate
lancaster
of
the
new
miss
chauncey
turned
to
me
saying
look
up
at
the
portrait
and
you
will
see
the
likeness
too
i
think
but
when
she
turned
and
saw
the
bare
wainscoting
of
the
room
she
looked
puzzled
and
the
bright
flash
which
had
lighted
up
her
face
was
gone
in
an
instant
and
she
sat
down
again
in
the
but
we
were
glad
that
she
had
forgotten
presently
she
said
pardon
me
but
i
forget
your
question
miss
carew
had
told
us
to
ask
her
about
her
as
she
nearly
always
spoke
of
that
time
to
her
and
to
our
delight
miss
sally
told
us
a
long
story
about
her
friends
and
about
her
party
when
of
gay
young
guests
came
down
from
riverport
and
all
the
gentry
from
deephaven
the
band
from
the
fort
played
for
the
dancing
the
garden
was
lighted
the
were
in
this
room
and
a
grand
supper
was
served
she
also
remembered
what
some
of
her
friends
wore
and
her
own
dress
was
a
brocade
with
rosebuds
of
three
colors
she
told
us
how
she
watched
the
boats
go
off
up
river
in
the
middle
of
the
summer
night
how
sweet
the
music
sounded
how
bright
the
moonlight
was
how
she
wished
we
had
been
there
at
her
party
i
ca
believe
i
am
an
old
woman
it
seems
only
yesterday
said
she
thoughtfully
and
then
she
lost
the
idea
and
talked
about
whom
she
had
known
and
asked
us
how
she
had
been
this
summer
she
asked
us
if
we
would
like
to
go
up
stairs
where
she
had
a
fire
and
we
eagerly
accepted
though
we
were
not
in
the
least
cold
ah
what
a
sorry
place
it
was
she
had
gathered
together
some
few
pieces
of
her
old
furniture
which
half
filled
one
fine
room
and
here
she
lived
there
was
a
tall
handsome
chest
of
drawers
which
i
should
have
liked
much
to
ransack
miss
carew
had
told
us
that
miss
chauncey
had
large
claims
against
the
government
dating
back
sixty
or
seventy
years
but
nobody
could
ever
find
the
papers
and
i
felt
sure
that
they
must
be
hidden
away
in
some
secret
drawer
the
brass
handles
and
trimmings
were
blackened
and
the
wood
looked
like
ebony
i
wanted
to
climb
up
and
look
into
the
upper
part
of
this
antique
piece
of
furniture
and
it
seemed
to
me
i
could
at
once
put
my
hand
on
a
package
of
papers
relating
to
the
embargo
on
a
stand
near
the
window
was
an
old
bible
fairly
worn
out
with
constant
use
miss
chauncey
was
religious
in
fact
it
was
the
only
subject
about
which
she
was
perfectly
sane
we
saw
almost
nothing
of
her
insanity
that
day
though
afterward
she
was
different
there
were
days
when
her
mind
seemed
clear
but
sometimes
she
was
silent
and
often
she
would
confuse
kate
with
miss
brandon
and
talk
to
her
of
plans
and
people
she
would
rarely
speak
of
anything
more
than
a
minute
or
two
and
then
would
drift
into
an
entirely
foreign
subject
she
urged
us
that
afternoon
to
stay
to
luncheon
with
her
she
said
she
could
not
offer
us
dinner
but
she
would
give
us
tea
and
biscuit
and
no
doubt
we
should
find
something
in
miss
carew
basket
as
she
was
always
kind
in
remembering
her
fancies
miss
honora
had
told
us
to
decline
if
she
asked
us
to
stay
but
i
should
have
liked
to
see
her
sit
at
the
head
of
her
table
and
to
be
a
guest
at
such
a
poor
creature
it
was
a
blessed
thing
that
her
shattered
reason
made
her
unconscious
of
the
change
in
her
fortunes
and
incapable
of
comparing
the
end
of
her
life
with
its
beginning
to
herself
she
was
still
miss
chauncey
a
gentlewoman
of
high
family
possessed
of
unusual
worldly
advantages
the
remembrance
of
her
cruel
trials
and
sorrows
had
faded
from
her
mind
she
had
no
idea
of
the
poverty
of
her
surroundings
when
she
paced
back
and
forth
with
stately
steps
on
the
ruined
terraces
of
her
garden
the
ranks
of
lilies
and
the
were
still
in
bloom
for
her
and
the
were
as
trimly
kept
as
ever
and
when
she
pointed
out
to
us
the
distant
steeples
of
riverport
it
was
plain
to
see
that
it
was
still
the
riverport
of
her
girlhood
if
the
at
the
foot
of
the
garden
had
long
ago
dropped
into
the
river
and
gone
out
with
the
tide
if
the
maids
and
men
who
used
to
do
her
bidding
were
all
out
of
hearing
if
there
had
been
no
dinner
company
that
day
and
no
guests
were
expected
for
the
evening
what
did
it
matter
the
twilight
had
closed
around
her
gradually
and
she
was
alone
in
her
house
but
she
did
not
heed
the
ruin
of
it
or
the
absence
of
her
friends
on
the
morrow
life
would
again
go
on
we
always
used
to
ask
her
to
read
the
bible
to
us
after
lorimer
had
told
us
how
grand
and
beautiful
it
was
to
listen
to
her
i
shall
never
hear
some
of
the
psalms
or
some
chapters
of
isaiah
again
without
being
reminded
of
her
and
i
remember
just
now
as
i
write
one
summer
afternoon
when
kate
and
i
had
lingered
later
than
usual
and
we
sat
in
the
upper
room
looking
out
on
the
river
and
the
shore
beyond
where
the
light
had
begun
to
grow
golden
as
the
day
drew
near
sunset
miss
sally
had
opened
the
great
book
at
random
and
read
slowly
in
my
house
are
many
mansions
and
then
looking
off
for
a
moment
at
a
leaf
which
had
drifted
into
the
she
repeated
it
in
my
father
house
are
many
mansions
if
it
were
not
so
i
would
have
told
you
then
she
went
on
slowly
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
and
with
her
hands
clasped
together
on
the
bible
she
fell
into
a
reverie
and
the
tears
came
into
our
eyes
as
we
watched
her
look
of
perfect
content
through
all
her
clouded
years
the
promises
of
god
had
been
her
only
certainty
miss
chauncey
died
early
in
the
winter
after
we
left
deephaven
and
one
day
when
i
was
visiting
kate
in
boston
lorimer
came
to
see
us
and
told
us
about
her
it
seems
that
after
much
persuasion
she
was
induced
to
go
to
spend
the
winter
with
a
neighbor
her
house
having
become
uninhabitable
and
she
was
beside
too
feeble
to
live
alone
but
her
fondness
for
her
old
home
was
too
strong
and
one
day
she
stole
away
from
the
people
who
took
care
of
her
and
crept
in
through
the
cellar
where
she
had
to
wade
through
water
and
then
went
up
stairs
where
she
seated
herself
at
a
front
window
and
called
joyfully
to
the
people
who
went
by
asking
them
to
come
in
to
see
her
as
she
had
got
home
again
after
this
she
was
very
ill
and
one
day
when
she
was
half
delirious
they
missed
her
and
found
her
at
last
sitting
on
her
hall
stairway
which
she
was
too
feeble
to
climb
she
lived
but
a
short
time
afterwards
and
in
her
last
days
her
mind
seemed
perfectly
clear
she
said
over
and
over
again
how
good
god
had
always
been
to
her
and
she
was
gentle
and
unwilling
to
be
a
trouble
to
those
who
had
the
care
of
her
lorimer
spoke
of
her
simple
goodness
and
told
us
that
though
she
had
no
other
sense
of
time
and
hardly
knew
if
it
were
summer
or
winter
she
was
always
sure
when
sunday
came
and
always
came
to
church
when
he
preached
at
east
parish
her
greatest
pleasure
seeming
to
be
to
give
money
if
there
was
a
contribution
she
may
be
a
lesson
to
us
added
the
old
minister
reverently
for
though
bewildered
in
mind
bereft
of
riches
and
friends
and
all
that
makes
this
world
dear
to
many
of
us
she
was
still
steadfast
in
her
simple
faith
and
was
never
heard
to
complain
of
any
of
the
burdens
which
god
had
given
her
days
in
when
the
summer
was
ended
it
was
no
sorrow
to
us
for
we
were
even
more
fond
of
deephaven
in
the
glorious
autumn
weather
than
we
had
ever
been
before
lancaster
was
abroad
longer
than
he
had
intended
to
be
at
first
and
it
was
late
in
the
season
before
we
left
we
were
both
ready
to
postpone
going
back
to
town
as
late
as
possible
but
at
last
it
was
time
for
my
friend
to
the
boston
housekeeping
and
to
take
up
the
city
life
again
i
must
admit
we
half
dreaded
it
we
were
surprised
to
find
how
little
we
cared
for
it
and
how
well
one
can
get
on
without
many
things
which
are
thought
indispensable
for
the
last
fortnight
we
were
in
the
house
a
good
deal
because
the
weather
was
wet
and
dreary
at
one
time
there
was
a
magnificent
storm
and
we
went
every
day
along
the
shore
in
the
wind
and
rain
for
a
mile
or
two
to
see
the
furious
great
breakers
come
plunging
in
against
the
rocks
i
never
had
seen
such
a
wild
stormy
sea
as
that
the
rage
of
it
was
awful
and
the
whole
harbor
was
white
with
foam
the
wind
had
blown
northeast
steadily
for
days
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
sea
never
could
be
quiet
and
smooth
and
blue
again
with
soft
white
clouds
sailing
over
it
in
the
sky
it
was
a
treacherous
sea
it
was
wicked
it
had
all
the
trembling
land
in
its
power
if
it
only
dared
to
send
its
great
waves
far
ashore
all
night
long
the
breakers
roared
and
the
wind
howled
in
the
chimneys
and
in
the
morning
we
always
looked
fearfully
across
the
surf
and
the
tossing
gray
water
to
see
if
the
lighthouse
were
standing
firm
on
its
rock
it
was
so
slender
a
thing
to
hold
its
own
in
such
a
wide
and
monstrous
sea
but
the
sun
came
out
at
last
and
not
many
days
afterward
we
went
out
with
danny
and
skipper
scudder
to
say
good
by
to
kew
i
have
been
some
voyages
at
sea
but
i
never
was
so
danced
about
in
a
little
boat
as
i
was
that
day
there
was
nothing
to
fear
with
so
careful
a
crew
and
we
only
enjoyed
the
roughness
as
we
went
out
and
in
though
it
took
much
manoeuvring
to
land
us
at
the
island
it
was
very
sad
work
to
us
saying
good
by
to
our
friends
and
we
tried
to
make
believe
that
we
should
spend
the
next
summer
in
deephaven
and
we
meant
at
any
rate
to
go
down
for
a
visit
we
were
glad
when
the
people
said
they
should
miss
us
and
that
they
hoped
we
should
not
forget
them
and
the
old
place
it
touched
us
to
find
that
they
cared
so
much
for
us
and
we
said
over
and
over
again
how
happy
we
had
been
and
that
it
was
such
a
satisfactory
summer

laughingly
proposed
one
evening
as
we
sat
talking
by
the
fire
and
were
particularly
contented
that
we
should
copy
the
ladies
of
llangollen
and
remove
ourselves
from
society
and
its
distractions
i
have
thought
often
lately
said
my
friend
what
a
good
time
they
must
have
had
and
i
feel
a
sympathy
and
friendliness
for
them
which
i
never
felt
before
we
could
have
guests
when
we
chose
as
we
have
had
this
summer
and
we
could
study
and
grow
very
wise
and
what
could
be
pleasanter
but
i
wonder
if
we
should
grow
very
lazy
if
we
stayed
here
all
the
year
round
village
life
is
not
stimulating
and
there
would
not
be
much
to
do
in
winter
though
i
do
not
believe
that
need
be
true
one
may
be
busy
and
useful
in
any
place
i
suppose
if
we
really
belonged
in
deephaven
we
should
think
it
a
hard
fate
and
not
enjoy
it
half
so
much
as
we
have
this
summer
said
i
our
idea
of
happiness
would
be
making
long
visits
in
boston
and
we
should
be
when
we
had
to
come
away
and
leave
our
and
symphony
concerts
and
calls
and
fairs
the
and
the
childrens
hospital
we
should
think
the
people
uncongenial
and
behind
the
times
and
that
the
ridge
road
was
stupid
and
the
long
sands
desolate
while
we
remembered
what
delightful
walks
we
had
taken
out
beacon
street
to
the
three
roads
and
over
the
cambridge
bridge
perhaps
we
should
even
be
ashamed
of
the
dear
old
church
for
being
so
out
of
fashion
we
should
have
the
blues
dreadfully
and
think
there
was
no
society
here
and
wonder
why
we
had
to
live
in
such
a
town
what
a
gloomy
picture
said
kate
laughing
do
you
know
that
i
have
understood
something
lately
better
than
i
ever
did
before
it
is
that
success
and
happiness
are
not
things
of
chance
with
us
but
of
choice
i
can
see
how
we
might
so
easily
have
had
a
dull
summer
here
of
course
it
is
our
own
fault
if
the
events
of
our
lives
are
hindrances
it
is
we
who
make
them
bad
or
good
sometimes
it
is
a
conscious
choice
but
oftener
unconscious
i
suppose
we
educate
ourselves
for
taking
the
best
of
life
or
the
worst
do
not
you
dear
old
deephaven
said
kate
gently
after
we
had
been
silent
a
little
while
it
makes
me
think
of
one
of
its
own
old
ladies
with
its
clinging
to
the
old
fashions
and
its
respect
for
what
used
to
be
respectable
when
it
was
young
i
can
not
make
fun
of
what
was
once
dear
to
somebody
and
which
realized
somebody
ideas
of
beauty
or
fitness
i
do
dispute
the
usefulness
of
a
new
bustling
manufacturing
town
with
its
progressive
ideas
but
there
is
a
simple
dignity
in
a
town
like
deephaven
as
if
it
tried
to
be
loyal
to
the
traditions
of
its
ancestors
it
quietly
accepts
its
altered
circumstances
if
it
has
seen
better
days
and
has
no
harsh
feelings
toward
the
places
which
have
drawn
away
its
business
but
it
lives
on
making
its
old
houses
and
boats
and
clothes
last
as
long
as
possible
i
think
one
can
not
help
said
i
having
a
different
affection
for
an
old
place
like
deephaven
from
that
which
one
may
have
for
a
newer
town
here
though
there
are
no
exciting
historical
associations
and
none
of
the
veneration
which
one
has
for
the
very
old
cities
and
towns
abroad
it
is
impossible
not
to
remember
how
many
people
have
walked
the
streets
and
lived
in
the
houses
i
was
thinking
how
many
girls
might
have
grown
up
in
this
house
and
that
their
places
have
been
ours
we
have
inherited
their
pleasures
and
perhaps
have
carried
on
work
which
they
began
we
sit
in
somebody
favorite
chair
and
look
out
of
the
windows
at
the
sea
and
have
our
wishes
and
our
hopes
and
plans
just
as
they
did
before
us
something
of
them
still
lingers
where
their
lives
were
spent
we
are
often
reminded
of
our
friends
who
have
died
why
are
we
not
reminded
as
surely
of
strangers
in
such
a
house
as
this
finding
some
trace
of
the
lives
which
were
lived
among
the
sights
we
see
and
the
things
we
handle
as
the
incense
of
many
masses
lingers
in
some
old
cathedral
and
one
catches
the
spirit
of
longing
and
prayer
where
so
many
heavy
hearts
have
brought
their
burdens
and
have
gone
away
comforted
when
i
first
came
here
said
kate
it
used
to
seem
very
sad
to
me
to
find
aunt
katharine
little
trinkets
lying
about
the
house
i
have
often
thought
of
what
you
have
just
said
i
heard
patton
say
the
other
day
that
there
is
no
pocket
in
a
shroud
and
of
course
it
is
better
that
we
should
carry
nothing
out
of
this
world
yet
i
ca
help
wishing
that
it
were
possible
to
keep
some
of
my
worldly
goods
always
there
are
one
or
two
books
of
mine
and
some
little
things
which
i
have
had
a
long
time
and
of
which
i
have
grown
very
fond
it
makes
me
so
sorry
to
think
of
their
being
neglected
and
lost
i
can
not
believe
i
shall
forget
these
earthly
treasures
when
i
am
in
heaven
and
i
wonder
if
i
shall
not
miss
them
is
it
strange
to
think
of
not
reading
bible
any
more
i
suppose
this
is
a
very
low
view
of
heaven
do
you
and
we
both
smiled
i
think
the
next
dwellers
in
this
house
ought
to
find
a
decided
atmosphere
of
contentment
said
i
have
you
ever
thought
that
it
took
us
some
time
to
make
it
your
house
instead
of
miss
brandon
it
used
to
seem
to
me
that
it
was
still
under
her
management
that
she
was
its
mistress
but
now
it
belongs
to
you
and
if
i
were
ever
to
come
back
without
you
i
should
find
you
here
it
is
bewildering
to
know
that
this
is
the
last
chapter
and
that
it
must
not
be
long
i
remember
so
many
of
our
pleasures
of
which
i
have
hardly
said
a
word
there
were
our
guests
of
whom
i
have
told
you
nothing
and
of
whom
there
was
so
much
to
say
of
course
we
asked
my
aunt
mary
to
visit
us
and
miss
margaret
tennant
and
many
of
our
girlfriends
all
the
people
we
know
who
have
yachts
made
the
port
of
deephaven
if
they
were
cruising
in
the
neighboring
waters
once
a
most
cheerful
party
of
kate
cousins
and
some
other
young
people
whom
we
knew
very
well
came
to
visit
us
in
this
way
and
the
yacht
was
kept
in
the
harbor
a
week
or
more
while
we
were
all
as
gay
as
bobolinks
and
went
frisking
about
the
country
and
kept
late
hours
in
the
sober
old
brandon
house
my
aunt
mary
who
was
with
us
and
kate
aunt
thorniford
who
knew
the
carews
and
was
commander
of
the
tried
to
keep
us
in
order
and
to
make
us
ornaments
to
deephaven
society
instead
of
reproaches
and
kate
younger
brothers
were
with
us
waiting
until
it
was
time
for
them
to
go
back
to
college
and
i
think
there
never
had
been
such
picnics
in
deephaven
before
and
i
fear
there
never
will
be
again
we
are
fond
of
reading
and
we
meant
to
do
a
great
deal
of
it
as
every
one
does
who
goes
away
for
the
summer
but
i
must
confess
that
our
grand
plans
were
not
well
carried
out
our
german
dictionaries
were
on
the
table
in
the
west
parlor
until
the
sight
of
them
mortified
us
and
finally
to
avoid
their
silent
reproach
i
put
them
in
the
closet
with
the
excuse
that
it
would
be
as
easy
to
get
them
there
and
they
would
be
out
of
the
way
we
used
to
have
the
magazines
sent
us
from
town
you
would
have
smiled
at
the
box
of
books
which
we
carried
to
deephaven
and
indeed
we
sent
two
or
three
times
for
others
but
i
do
not
remember
that
we
ever
carried
out
that
course
of
study
which
we
had
planned
with
so
much
interest
we
were
out
of
doors
so
much
that
there
was
often
little
time
for
anything
else
kate
said
one
day
that
she
did
not
care
in
reading
to
be
always
making
new
acquaintances
but
to
be
seeing
more
of
old
ones
and
i
think
it
is
a
very
wise
idea
we
each
have
our
pet
books
kate
carries
with
her
a
copy
of
rutherford
children
which
has
been
her
delight
ever
since
she
can
remember
sibyl
and
chryssa
are
dear
old
friends
though
i
suppose
now
it
is
not
merely
what
kate
reads
but
what
she
associates
with
the
story
i
am
not
often
separated
from
jean
ingelow
stories
told
to
a
child
that
charmingly
wise
and
pleasant
little
book
it
is
always
new
like
kate
favorite
it
is
very
hard
to
make
a
list
of
the
books
one
likes
best
but
i
remember
that
we
had
the
village
on
the
cliff
and
henry
esmond
and
tom
brown
at
rugby
with
his
more
serious
ancestor
sir
thomas
browne
i
am
sure
we
had
fenelon
for
we
always
have
that
and
there
was
pet
marjorie
and
rab
and
annals
of
a
parish
and
the
life
of
the
reverend
sydney
smith
beside
miss
tytler
days
of
yore
and
the
holy
and
profane
state
by
thomas
fuller
from
which
kate
gets
so
much
entertainment
and
profit
we
read
emerson
essays
together
out
of
doors
and
some
stories
which
had
been
our
dear
friends
at
school
like
leslie
goldthwaite
there
was
a
very
good
library
in
the
house
and
we
both
like
old
books
so
we
enjoyed
that
and
we
used
to
read
the
spectator
and
many
stories
and
essays
and
sermons
with
much
more
pleasure
because
they
had
such
quaint
old
brown
leather
bindings
you
will
not
doubt
that
we
had
some
cherished
volumes
of
poetry
or
that
we
used
to
read
them
aloud
to
each
other
when
we
sat
in
our
favorite
corner
of
the
rocks
at
the
shore
or
were
in
the
pine
woods
of
an
afternoon
we
used
to
go
out
to
tea
and
do
a
great
deal
of
social
visiting
which
was
very
pleasant
were
not
in
fashion
though
it
was
a
great
attention
to
be
asked
to
spend
the
day
which
courtesy
we
used
to
delight
in
extending
to
our
friends
and
we
entertained
company
in
that
way
often
when
we
first
went
out
we
were
somewhat
interesting
on
account
of
our
clothes
which
were
of
later
pattern
than
had
been
adopted
generally
in
deephaven
we
used
to
take
great
pleasure
in
arraying
ourselves
on
high
days
and
holidays
since
when
we
went
wandering
on
shore
or
out
sailing
or
rowing
we
did
not
always
dress
as
befitted
our
position
in
the
town
and
so
soon
disfigure
one
clothes
we
became
in
the
course
of
time
learned
in
all
manner
of
lore
and
even
profitably
employed
ourselves
one
morning
in
going
with
old
ben
horn
a
most
fascinating
ancient
mariner
we
both
grew
so
well
and
brown
and
strong
and
kate
and
i
did
not
get
tired
of
each
other
at
all
which
i
think
was
wonderful
for
few
friendships
would
bear
such
a
test
we
were
together
always
and
alone
together
a
great
deal
and
we
became
wonderfully
well
acquainted
we
are
such
good
friends
that
we
often
were
silent
for
a
long
time
when
mere
acquaintances
would
have
felt
compelled
to
talk
and
try
to
entertain
each
other
before
we
left
the
leaves
had
fallen
off
all
the
trees
except
the
oaks
which
make
in
cold
weather
one
of
the
dreariest
sounds
one
ever
hears
a
shivering
rustle
which
makes
one
pity
the
tree
and
imagine
it
shelterless
and
forlorn
the
sea
had
looked
rough
and
cold
for
many
days
and
the
old
house
itself
had
grown
chilly
all
the
world
seemed
waiting
for
the
snow
to
come
there
was
nobody
loitering
on
the
wharves
and
when
we
went
down
the
street
we
walked
fast
arm
in
arm
to
keep
warm
the
houses
were
shut
up
as
close
as
possible
and
the
old
sailors
did
not
seem
cheery
any
longer
they
looked
forlorn
and
it
was
not
a
pleasant
prospect
to
be
so
long
in
port
if
they
ventured
out
they
put
on
ancient
with
huge
flaps
to
the
pockets
and
large
horn
buttons
and
they
looked
contemptuously
at
the
vane
which
always
pointed
to
the
north
or
east
it
felt
like
winter
and
the
captains
rolled
more
than
ever
as
they
walked
as
if
they
were
on
deck
in
a
heavy
sea
the
rheumatism
claimed
many
victims
and
there
was
one
day
it
must
be
confessed
when
a
biting
icy
fog
was
blown
that
kate
and
i
were
willing
to
admit
that
we
could
be
as
comfortable
in
town
and
it
was
almost
time
for
sealskin
jackets
in
the
front
yards
we
saw
the
black
with
frost
except
a
few
brave
pansies
which
had
kept
green
and
had
bloomed
under
the
tall
stalks
and
one
day
we
picked
some
of
these
little
flowers
to
put
between
the
leaves
of
a
book
and
take
away
with
us
i
think
we
loved
deephaven
all
the
more
in
those
last
days
with
a
bit
of
compassion
in
our
tenderness
for
the
dear
old
town
which
had
so
little
to
amuse
it
so
long
a
winter
was
coming
but
we
thought
with
a
sigh
how
pleasant
it
would
be
in
the
spring
you
would
have
smiled
at
the
treasures
we
brought
away
with
us
we
had
become
so
fond
of
even
our
and
this
very
day
you
may
see
in
kate
room
two
great
bunches
of
deephaven
they
were
much
in
our
way
on
the
journey
home
but
we
clung
affectionately
to
these
last
sheaves
of
our
harvest
the
morning
we
came
away
our
friends
were
all
looking
out
from
door
or
window
to
see
us
go
by
and
after
we
had
passed
the
last
house
and
there
was
no
need
to
smile
any
longer
we
were
very
dismal
the
sun
was
shining
again
bright
and
warm
as
if
the
indian
summer
were
beginning
and
we
wished
that
it
had
been
a
rainy
day
the
thought
of
deephaven
will
always
bring
to
us
our
long
quiet
summer
days
and
reading
aloud
on
the
rocks
by
the
sea
the
fresh
salt
air
and
the
glory
of
the
sunsets
the
wail
of
the
sunday
at
church
the
yellow
lichen
that
grew
over
the
trees
the
houses
and
the
our
boating
and
wanderings
ashore
our
importance
as
members
of
society
and
how
kind
every
one
was
to
us
both
by
and
by
the
deephaven
warehouses
will
fall
and
be
used
for
firewood
by
the
and
the
wharves
will
be
worn
away
by
the
tides
the
few
old
gentlefolks
who
still
linger
will
be
dead
then
and
i
wonder
if
some
day
kate
lancaster
and
i
will
go
down
to
deephaven
for
the
sake
of
old
times
and
read
the
epitaphs
in
the
look
out
to
sea
and
talk
quietly
about
the
girls
who
were
so
happy
there
one
summer
long
before
i
should
like
to
walk
along
the
beach
at
sunset
and
watch
the
color
of
the
marshes
and
the
sea
change
as
the
light
of
the
sky
goes
out
it
would
make
the
old
days
come
back
vividly
we
should
see
the
roofs
and
chimneys
of
the
village
and
the
great
chantrey
elms
look
black
against
the
sky
a
little
later
the
marsh
fog
would
show
faintly
white
and
we
should
feel
it
deliciously
cold
and
wet
against
our
hands
and
faces
when
we
looked
up
there
would
be
a
star
the
crickets
would
chirp
loudly
perhaps
some
late
would
fly
inland
turning
we
should
see
the
lighthouse
lamp
shine
out
over
the
water
and
the
great
sea
would
move
and
speak
to
us
lazily
in
its
idle
sleep
selected
stories
and
sketches
contents
an
autumn
holiday
from
a
mournful
villager
an
october
ride
tom
husband
miss
debby
neighbors
autumn
i
had
started
early
in
the
afternoon
for
a
long
walk
it
was
just
the
weather
for
walking
and
i
went
across
the
fields
with
a
delighted
heart
the
wind
came
straight
in
from
the
sea
and
the
sky
was
bright
blue
there
was
a
little
tinge
of
red
still
lingering
on
the
maples
and
my
dress
brushed
over
the
late
while
my
old
dog
who
seemed
to
have
taken
a
new
lease
of
youth
jumped
about
wildly
and
raced
after
the
little
birds
that
flew
up
out
of
the
long
brown
grass
the
constant
little
chickadees
that
would
soon
sing
before
the
coming
of
snow
but
this
day
brought
no
thought
of
winter
it
was
one
of
the
october
days
when
to
breathe
the
air
is
like
drinking
wine
and
every
touch
of
the
wind
against
one
face
is
a
caress
like
a
quick
sweet
kiss
that
wind
is
you
have
a
sense
of
companionship
it
is
a
day
that
loves
you
i
went
strolling
along
with
this
dear
idle
day
for
company
it
was
a
pleasure
to
be
alive
and
to
go
through
the
dry
grass
and
to
spring
over
the
stone
walls
and
the
shaky
pasture
fences
i
stopped
by
each
of
the
stray
that
came
in
my
way
to
make
friends
with
it
or
to
ask
after
its
health
if
it
were
an
old
friend
these
old
make
very
charming
bits
of
the
world
in
october
the
leaves
cling
to
them
later
than
to
the
other
trees
and
the
turf
keeps
short
and
green
underneath
and
in
this
grass
which
was
frosty
in
the
morning
and
has
not
quite
dried
yet
you
can
find
some
cold
little
cider
apples
with
one
side
knurly
and
one
shiny
bright
red
or
yellow
cheek
they
are
wet
with
dew
these
little
apples
and
a
black
ant
runs
anxiously
over
them
when
you
turn
them
round
and
round
to
see
where
the
best
place
is
to
bite
there
will
almost
always
be
a
bird
nest
in
the
tree
and
it
is
most
likely
to
be
a
robin
nest
the
prehistoric
robins
must
have
been
cave
dwellers
for
they
still
make
their
nests
as
much
like
cellars
as
they
can
though
they
follow
the
new
fashion
and
build
them
aloft
one
always
has
a
thought
of
spring
at
the
sight
of
a
robin
nest
it
is
so
little
while
ago
that
it
was
spring
and
we
were
so
glad
to
have
the
birds
come
back
and
the
life
of
the
new
year
was
just
showing
itself
we
were
looking
forward
to
so
much
growth
and
to
the
realization
and
perfection
of
so
many
things
i
think
the
sadness
of
autumn
or
the
pathos
of
it
is
like
that
of
elderly
people
we
have
seen
how
the
flowers
looked
when
they
bloomed
and
have
eaten
the
fruit
when
it
was
ripe
the
questions
have
had
their
answer
the
days
we
waited
for
have
come
and
gone
everything
has
stopped
growing
and
so
the
children
have
grown
to
be
men
and
women
their
lives
have
been
lived
the
autumn
has
come
we
have
seen
what
our
lives
would
be
like
when
we
were
older
success
or
disappointment
it
is
all
over
at
any
rate
yet
it
only
makes
one
sad
to
think
it
is
autumn
with
the
flowers
or
with
one
own
life
when
one
forgets
that
always
and
always
there
will
be
the
spring
again
i
am
very
fond
of
walking
between
the
roads
one
grows
so
familiar
with
the
highways
themselves
but
once
leap
the
fence
and
there
are
a
hundred
roads
that
you
can
take
each
with
its
own
scenery
and
entertainment
every
walk
of
this
kind
proves
itself
a
tour
of
exploration
and
discovery
and
the
fields
of
my
own
town
which
i
think
i
know
so
well
are
always
new
fields
i
find
new
ways
to
go
new
sights
to
see
new
friends
among
the
things
that
grow
and
new
treasures
and
pleasures
every
summer
and
later
when
the
frosts
have
come
and
the
swamps
have
frozen
i
can
go
everywhere
i
like
all
over
my
world
that
afternoon
i
found
something
i
had
never
seen
before
a
little
grave
alone
in
a
wide
pasture
which
had
once
been
a
field
the
nearest
house
was
at
least
two
miles
away
but
by
hunting
for
it
i
found
a
very
old
cellar
where
the
child
home
used
to
be
not
very
far
off
along
the
slope
it
must
have
been
a
great
many
years
ago
that
the
house
had
stood
there
and
the
small
slate
was
worn
away
by
the
rain
and
wind
so
there
was
nothing
to
be
read
if
indeed
there
had
ever
been
any
letters
on
it
it
had
looked
many
a
storm
in
the
face
and
many
a
red
sunset
i
suppose
the
woods
near
by
had
grown
and
been
cut
and
grown
again
since
it
was
put
there
there
was
an
old
bush
growing
on
the
short
little
grave
and
in
the
grass
underneath
i
found
a
nest
it
was
like
a
little
neighborhood
and
i
have
felt
ever
since
as
if
i
belonged
to
it
and
i
wondered
then
if
one
of
the
young
was
not
always
sent
to
take
the
nest
when
the
old
ones
were
done
with
it
so
they
came
back
in
the
spring
year
after
year
to
live
there
and
there
were
always
the
stone
and
the
bush
and
the
birds
to
remember
the
child
it
was
such
a
lonely
place
in
that
wide
field
under
the
great
sky
and
yet
it
was
so
comfortable
too
but
the
sight
of
the
little
grave
at
first
touched
me
strangely
and
i
tried
to
picture
to
myself
the
procession
that
came
out
from
the
house
the
day
of
the
funeral
and
i
thought
of
the
mother
in
the
evening
after
all
the
people
had
gone
home
and
how
she
missed
the
baby
and
kept
seeing
the
new
grave
out
here
in
the
twilight
as
she
went
about
her
work
i
suppose
the
family
moved
away
and
so
all
the
rest
were
buried
elsewhere
i
often
think
of
this
place
and
i
link
it
in
my
thoughts
with
something
i
saw
once
in
the
water
when
i
was
out
at
sea
a
little
boat
that
some
child
had
lost
that
had
drifted
down
the
river
and
out
to
sea
too
long
a
voyage
for
it
was
a
sad
little
wreck
with
even
its
white
sail
of
a
half
under
water
and
its
twine
rigging
trailing
astern
it
was
a
silly
little
boat
and
no
loss
except
to
its
owner
to
whom
it
had
seemed
as
brave
and
proud
a
thing
as
any
ship
of
the
line
to
you
and
me
it
was
a
shipwreck
of
his
small
hopes
i
suppose
and
i
can
see
it
now
the
toy
of
the
great
winds
and
waves
as
it
floated
on
its
way
while
i
sailed
on
mine
out
of
sight
of
land
the
little
grave
is
forgotten
by
everybody
but
me
i
think
the
mother
must
have
found
the
child
again
in
heaven
a
very
long
time
ago
but
in
the
winter
i
shall
wonder
if
the
snow
has
covered
it
well
and
next
year
i
shall
go
to
see
the
bush
when
it
is
in
bloom
god
knows
what
use
that
life
was
the
grave
is
such
a
short
one
and
nobody
knows
whose
little
child
it
was
but
perhaps
a
thousand
people
in
the
world
are
better
because
it
brought
a
little
love
into
the
world
that
was
not
there
before
i
sat
so
long
here
in
the
sun
that
the
dog
after
running
after
all
the
birds
and
even
chasing
crickets
and
going
through
a
great
piece
of
affectation
in
barking
before
an
empty
woodchuck
hole
to
kill
time
came
to
sit
patiently
in
front
of
me
as
if
he
wished
to
ask
when
i
would
go
on
i
had
never
been
in
this
part
of
the
pasture
before
it
was
at
one
side
of
the
way
i
usually
took
so
presently
i
went
on
to
find
a
favorite
track
of
mine
half
a
mile
to
the
right
along
the
bank
of
a
brook
there
had
been
heavy
rains
the
week
before
and
i
found
more
water
than
usual
running
and
the
brook
was
apparently
in
a
great
hurry
it
was
very
quiet
along
the
shore
of
it
the
frogs
had
long
ago
gone
into
and
there
was
not
one
to
splash
into
the
water
when
he
saw
me
coming
i
did
not
see
a
either
though
i
knew
where
their
holes
were
by
the
piles
of
mussel
shells
that
they
had
untidily
thrown
out
at
their
front
door
i
thought
it
might
be
well
to
hunt
for
mussels
myself
and
crack
them
in
search
of
pearls
but
it
was
too
serene
and
beautiful
a
day
i
was
not
willing
to
disturb
the
comfort
of
even
a
it
was
one
of
the
days
when
one
does
not
think
of
being
tired
the
scent
of
the
dry
everlasting
flowers
and
the
freshness
of
the
wind
and
the
cawing
of
the
crows
all
come
to
me
as
i
think
of
it
and
i
remember
that
i
went
a
long
way
before
i
began
to
think
of
going
home
again
i
knew
i
could
not
be
far
from
a
and
when
i
climbed
a
low
hill
i
saw
a
house
which
i
was
glad
to
make
the
end
of
my
walk
for
a
time
at
any
rate
it
was
some
time
since
i
had
seen
the
old
woman
who
lived
there
and
i
liked
her
dearly
and
was
sure
of
a
welcome
i
went
down
through
the
pasture
lane
and
just
then
i
saw
my
father
drive
away
up
the
road
just
too
far
for
me
to
make
him
hear
when
i
called
that
seemed
too
bad
at
first
until
i
remembered
that
he
would
come
back
again
over
the
same
road
after
a
while
and
in
the
mean
time
i
could
make
my
call
the
house
was
low
and
long
and
unpainted
with
a
great
many
flowers
about
it
some
hollyhocks
were
bowed
down
despairingly
and
the
vines
were
more
miserable
still
some
of
the
smaller
plants
had
been
covered
to
keep
them
from
freezing
and
were
braving
out
a
few
more
days
but
no
shelter
would
avail
them
much
longer
and
already
nobody
minded
whether
the
gate
was
shut
or
not
and
part
of
the
great
flock
of
hens
were
marching
proudly
about
among
the
wilted
posies
which
they
had
stretched
their
necks
wistfully
through
the
fence
for
all
summer
i
heard
the
noise
of
spinning
in
the
house
and
my
dog
scurried
off
after
the
cat
as
i
went
in
the
door
i
saw
miss
polly
marsh
and
her
sister
mrs
snow
stepping
back
and
forward
together
spinning
yarn
at
a
pair
of
big
wheels
the
wheels
made
such
a
noise
with
their
whir
and
creak
and
my
friends
were
talking
so
fast
as
they
twisted
and
turned
the
yarn
that
they
did
not
hear
my
footstep
and
i
stood
in
the
doorway
watching
them
it
was
such
a
quaint
and
pretty
sight
they
went
together
like
a
pair
of
horses
and
kept
step
with
each
other
to
and
fro
they
were
about
the
same
size
and
were
cheerful
old
bodies
looking
a
good
deal
alike
with
their
checked
handkerchiefs
over
their
smooth
gray
hair
their
dark
gowns
made
short
in
the
skirts
and
their
broad
little
feet
in
gray
stockings
and
low
leather
shoes
without
heels
they
stood
straight
and
though
they
were
quick
at
their
work
they
moved
stiffly
they
were
talking
busily
about
some
one
i
could
tell
by
the
way
the
doctor
looked
that
he
did
think
there
was
much
of
anything
the
matter
with
her
said
miss
polly
marsh
need
tell
me
says
i
the
other
day
when
i
see
him
at
miss
martin
be
up
and
about
this
minute
if
she
only
had
a
mite
resolution
and
says
he
polly
you
as
near
right
as
usual
and
the
old
lady
stopped
to
laugh
a
little
i
told
him
that
saying
much
said
she
with
an
evident
consciousness
of
the
underlying
compliment
and
the
doctor
good
opinion
i
never
knew
one
of
that
tribe
that
had
a
queer
streak
and
was
but
tougher
than
ellum
roots
and
she
gave
the
wheel
an
emphatic
turn
while
mrs
snow
reached
for
more
rolls
of
wool
and
happened
to
see
me
wherever
did
you
come
from
said
they
in
great
surprise
why
you
was
anywhere
in
sight
when
i
was
out
speaking
to
the
doctor
said
mrs
snow
oh
come
over
horseback
i
suppose
well
now
we
pleased
to
see
ye
no
said
i
i
walked
across
the
fields
it
was
too
pleasant
to
stay
in
the
house
and
i
have
had
a
long
walk
for
some
time
before
i
begged
them
not
to
stop
spinning
but
they
insisted
that
they
should
not
have
turned
the
wheels
a
times
more
even
if
i
had
not
come
and
they
pushed
them
back
to
the
wall
before
they
came
to
sit
down
to
talk
with
me
over
their
knitting
for
neither
of
them
were
ever
known
to
be
idle
mrs
snow
was
only
there
for
a
visit
she
was
a
widow
and
lived
during
most
of
the
year
with
her
son
and
aunt
polly
was
at
home
but
seldom
herself
as
she
was
a
famous
nurse
and
was
often
in
demand
all
through
that
part
of
the
country
i
had
known
her
all
my
days
everybody
was
fond
of
the
good
soul
and
she
had
been
one
of
the
most
useful
women
in
the
world
one
of
my
pleasantest
memories
is
of
a
long
but
not
very
painful
illness
one
winter
when
she
came
to
take
care
of
me
there
was
no
end
either
to
her
stories
or
her
kindness
i
was
delighted
to
find
her
at
home
that
afternoon
and
mrs
snow
also
aunt
polly
brought
me
some
of
her
gingerbread
which
she
knew
i
liked
and
a
stout
little
pitcher
of
milk
and
we
sat
there
together
for
a
while
gossiping
and
enjoying
ourselves
i
told
all
the
village
news
that
i
could
think
of
and
i
was
just
tired
enough
to
know
it
and
to
be
contented
to
sit
still
for
a
while
in
the
comfortable
chair
by
the
little
front
window
the
october
sunshine
lay
along
the
clean
kitchen
floor
and
aunt
polly
darted
from
her
chair
occasionally
to
catch
stray
little
wisps
of
wool
which
the
breeze
through
the
door
blew
along
from
the
wheels
there
was
a
gay
string
of
red
peppers
hanging
over
the
very
high
and
the
in
the
room
had
never
been
painted
and
had
grown
dark
brown
with
age
and
smoke
and
scouring
the
clock
ticked
solemnly
as
if
it
were
a
judge
giving
the
laws
of
time
and
felt
itself
to
be
the
only
thing
that
did
not
waste
it
there
was
a
bouquet
of
asparagus
and
some
late
sprigs
of
larkspur
and
white
petunias
on
the
table
underneath
and
a
leavitt
almanac
lay
on
the
county
paper
which
was
itself
lying
on
the
big
bible
of
which
aunt
polly
made
a
point
of
reading
two
chapters
every
day
in
course
i
remember
her
saying
despairingly
one
night
half
to
herself
i
know
but
i
may
skip
the
chronicles
next
time
but
i
have
never
to
this
day
believed
that
she
did
they
asked
me
at
once
to
come
into
the
best
room
but
i
liked
the
old
kitchen
best
who
was
it
that
you
were
talking
about
as
i
came
in
said
i
you
said
you
did
believe
there
was
much
the
matter
with
her
and
aunt
polly
clicked
her
faster
and
told
me
that
it
was
mary
susan
ash
over
by
little
creek
they
dreadful
nervous
all
them
ashes
said
mrs
snow
you
know
young
joe
adams
wife
over
our
way
is
a
sister
to
her
and
forever
poor
fellow
got
a
drag
i
real
sorry
for
joe
but
land
sakes
alive
he
might
known
better
they
said
she
had
an
old
green
bandbox
with
a
gingham
cover
that
was
stowed
full
vials
that
she
moved
with
the
rest
of
her
things
when
she
was
married
besides
some
she
car
in
her
hands
i
guess
she
ai
in
no
more
hurry
to
go
than
any
of
the
rest
of
us
i
lost
every
mite
of
patience
with
her
i
was
over
there
last
week
one
day
and
she
had
a
call
from
the
new
supply
you
know
adams
folks
is
methodists
and
he
was
took
in
by
her
she
made
out
she
got
the
consumption
and
she
told
how
many
complaints
she
had
and
what
a
sight
o
medicine
she
took
and
she
groaned
and
sighed
and
her
voice
was
so
weak
you
could
more
than
just
hear
it
i
stepped
right
into
the
bedroom
after
he
been
with
her
and
was
taking
leave
you
thought
by
what
he
said
she
was
going
right
off
then
she
was
coughing
dreadful
hard
and
i
knew
she
had
no
more
cough
than
i
had
so
says
i
the
matter
adaline
i
get
ye
a
drink
of
water
something
in
your
throat
i
i
hope
you
wo
go
and
get
cold
and
have
a
cough
she
looked
as
if
she
could
bit
me
but
i
was
just
as
pleasant
could
be
land
to
see
her
laying
there
i
suppose
the
poor
young
fellow
thought
she
was
all
gone
he
meant
well
i
wish
he
had
seen
her
eating
for
dinner
she
felt
better
in
the
first
o
the
afternoon
before
he
come
i
says
to
her
right
before
him
that
i
guessed
them
dumplings
did
her
good
but
she
never
made
no
answer
she
will
have
these
dyin
spells
i
do
know
she
can
help
it
but
she
need
act
as
if
it
was
a
credit
to
anybody
to
be
sick
and
laid
up
poor
joe
he
come
over
for
me
last
week
another
day
and
said
she
been
havin
spasms
and
asked
me
if
there
something
i
could
think
of
says
i
just
take
a
pail
o
water
and
throw
it
square
into
her
face
bring
her
out
of
it
and
he
looked
at
me
a
minute
and
then
he
burst
out
he
could
help
it
he
too
good
to
her
that
the
trouble
you
never
said
that
to
her
about
the
dumplings
said
aunt
polly
admiringly
well
should
ha
dared
and
she
rocked
and
knitted
away
faster
than
ever
while
we
all
laughed
now
with
mary
susan
different
i
suppose
she
does
have
the
neurology
and
she
a
poor
creature
i
do
feel
for
her
more
than
i
do
for
adaline
she
was
always
a
willing
girl
and
she
worked
herself
to
death
and
she
ca
help
these
notions
nor
being
an
ash
neither
i
the
last
one
to
be
hard
on
anybody
that
sick
and
in
trouble
said
mrs
snow
bless
you
she
set
up
with
herself
three
nights
in
one
week
to
my
knowledge
it
i
would
do
said
aunt
polly
as
if
there
were
danger
that
i
should
think
mrs
snow
kind
heart
to
be
made
of
flint
it
ai
what
i
call
watching
said
she
apologetically
we
both
doze
off
and
then
when
the
folks
come
in
in
the
morning
she
tell
what
a
sufferin
night
she
had
she
likes
to
have
it
said
she
has
to
have
watchers
it
strange
what
a
queer
streak
there
is
running
through
the
whole
of
said
aunt
polly
presently
it
always
was
so
far
back
you
can
follow
did
you
ever
hear
about
that
of
theirs
that
lived
over
to
the
other
side
o
denby
over
to
what
they
call
the
denby
meadows
we
had
a
cousin
o
my
father
that
kept
house
for
him
he
was
a
single
man
and
i
spent
most
of
a
summer
and
fall
with
her
once
when
i
was
growing
up
she
seemed
to
want
company
it
was
a
lonesome
sort
of
a
place
there
i
do
know
when
i
have
thought
to
that
said
mrs
snow
looking
much
amused
what
stories
you
did
use
to
tell
after
you
come
home
about
the
way
he
used
to
act
dear
sakes
she
used
to
keep
us
laughing
till
we
was
tired
do
tell
her
about
him
polly
she
like
to
hear
well
i
forgot
a
good
deal
about
it
you
see
it
was
much
as
fifty
years
ago
i
was
more
than
seventeen
or
eighteen
years
old
he
was
a
very
respectable
man
old
gunn
was
and
a
in
the
militia
in
his
day
gunn
they
always
called
him
he
was
well
off
but
he
got
and
never
was
just
right
in
his
mind
afterward
when
he
was
getting
over
his
sickness
after
the
stroke
he
was
very
wandering
and
at
last
he
seemed
to
get
it
into
his
head
that
he
was
his
own
sister
patience
that
died
some
five
or
six
years
before
she
was
single
too
and
she
always
lived
with
him
they
said
when
he
got
so
to
sit
up
in
his
of
an
afternoon
when
he
was
getting
better
he
fought
dreadfully
because
they
fetched
him
his
own
clothes
to
put
on
he
said
they
was
brother
clothes
so
sure
enough
they
got
out
an
old
double
gown
and
let
him
put
it
on
and
he
was
as
peaceable
as
could
be
the
doctor
told
to
humor
him
but
they
thought
it
was
a
fancy
he
took
and
he
would
forget
it
but
the
next
day
he
made
get
the
double
gown
again
and
a
cap
too
and
there
he
used
to
set
up
alongside
of
his
bed
as
prim
as
a
dish
when
he
got
round
again
so
he
could
set
up
all
day
they
thought
he
wanted
the
dress
but
no
he
seemed
to
be
himself
and
had
on
his
own
clothes
just
as
usual
in
the
morning
but
when
he
took
his
nap
after
dinner
and
waked
up
again
he
was
in
a
dreadful
frame
o
mind
and
had
the
trousers
and
coat
off
in
no
time
and
said
he
was
patience
he
used
to
fuss
with
some
he
got
hold
of
somehow
he
was
as
could
be
and
sometimes
he
would
make
fetch
him
the
cat
because
patience
used
to
have
a
cat
that
set
in
her
lap
while
she
knit
i
was
there
then
you
know
but
they
used
to
tell
me
about
it
folks
used
to
call
him
miss
gunn
he
been
that
way
some
time
when
i
went
over
i
heard
about
his
notions
and
i
was
scared
of
him
at
first
but
i
found
out
there
no
need
do
you
know
i
was
sort
o
to
go
when
cousin
statiry
sent
for
me
after
she
went
home
from
that
visit
she
made
here
she
told
us
about
him
but
sometimes
at
the
first
of
it
he
used
to
be
cross
he
never
was
after
i
went
there
he
was
a
clever
man
if
ever
there
was
one
said
aunt
polly
with
decision
he
used
to
go
down
to
the
corner
to
the
store
sometimes
in
the
morning
and
he
would
see
to
business
and
before
he
got
feeble
sometimes
he
would
work
out
on
the
farm
all
the
morning
stiddy
as
any
of
the
men
but
after
he
come
in
to
dinner
he
would
take
off
his
coat
if
he
had
it
on
and
fall
asleep
in
his
or
on
a
there
was
in
his
bedroom
and
when
he
waked
up
he
would
be
sort
of
bewildered
for
a
while
and
then
he
step
round
quick
he
could
and
get
his
dress
out
o
the
and
the
cap
and
put
on
right
over
the
rest
of
his
clothes
he
was
always
and
and
i
don
know
as
to
come
in
sudden
you
would
have
thought
he
was
a
man
except
his
hair
stood
up
short
and
straight
all
on
the
top
of
his
head
as
had
a
fashion
o
combing
their
hair
then
and
i
must
say
he
did
make
a
dreadful
woman
the
neighbors
got
used
to
his
ways
and
land
i
never
thought
nothing
of
it
after
the
first
week
or
two
his
sister
clothes
that
he
wore
first
was
too
small
for
him
and
so
my
cousin
statiry
that
kep
his
house
she
made
him
a
dress
with
a
considerable
short
skirt
and
he
was
dreadful
pleased
with
it
she
said
because
the
other
one
never
would
button
over
good
and
showed
his
and
she
and
i
used
to
make
him
caps
he
used
to
wear
the
kind
all
the
old
women
did
then
with
a
big
crown
and
close
round
the
face
i
got
some
laid
away
now
that
was
my
mother
she
wore
caps
very
young
mother
did
his
nephew
that
lived
with
him
carried
on
the
farm
and
managed
the
business
but
he
always
treated
the
as
if
he
was
head
of
everything
there
everybody
pitied
the
folks
respected
him
but
you
could
help
laughing
to
save
ye
we
used
to
try
to
keep
him
in
afternoons
but
we
always
tell
her
about
that
day
he
went
to
meeting
said
mrs
snow
why
one
of
us
always
used
to
stay
to
home
with
him
we
took
turns
and
somehow
or
he
never
offered
to
go
though
by
spells
he
would
be
constant
to
meeting
in
the
morning
why
bless
you
you
never
think
anything
ailed
him
a
good
deal
of
the
time
if
you
saw
him
before
noon
though
sometimes
he
would
be
freaky
and
hide
himself
in
the
barn
or
go
over
in
the
woods
but
we
always
kept
an
eye
on
him
but
this
sunday
there
was
going
to
be
a
great
occasion
old
parson
croden
was
going
to
preach
he
was
thought
more
of
than
anybody
in
this
region
you
heard
tell
of
him
a
good
many
times
i
he
was
getting
to
be
old
and
did
preach
much
he
had
a
colleague
they
set
so
much
by
him
in
his
parish
and
i
did
know
i
ever
get
another
chance
to
hear
him
so
i
did
want
to
stay
to
home
and
neither
did
cousin
statiry
and
jacob
gunn
old
gunn
nephew
he
said
it
might
be
the
last
time
ever
hear
parson
croden
and
he
set
in
the
seats
anyway
so
we
talked
it
all
over
and
we
got
a
young
boy
to
come
and
set
of
the
till
we
got
back
he
had
offered
to
go
anywhere
of
an
afternoon
for
a
long
time
i
he
thought
women
ought
to
be
stayers
at
home
according
to
scripture
parson
ridley
his
wife
was
a
niece
to
old
croden
and
the
old
doctor
they
was
up
in
the
pulpit
and
the
choir
was
singing
the
first
hymn
it
was
a
fuguing
tune
and
they
was
doing
their
best
seems
to
me
it
was
new
yes
it
was
i
remember
i
thought
how
splendid
it
sounded
and
jacob
gunn
he
was
off
and
i
happened
to
look
down
the
aisle
and
who
should
i
see
but
the
poor
old
in
his
cap
and
gown
parading
right
into
meeting
before
all
the
folks
there
i
wanted
to
go
through
the
floor
everybody
had
seen
him
at
home
but
my
goodness
to
have
him
come
into
meeting
what
did
you
do
said
i
why
nothing
said
miss
polly
there
was
nothing
do
i
thought
i
should
faint
away
but
i
called
cousin
statiry
and
she
looked
dreadful
put
to
it
for
a
minute
and
then
says
she
the
door
for
him
i
guess
he
wo
make
no
trouble
and
poor
soul
he
did
but
to
see
him
come
up
the
aisle
he
fixed
himself
nice
as
he
could
poor
creatur
he
raked
out
miss
patience
old
navarino
bonnet
with
green
ribbons
and
a
willow
feather
and
set
it
on
right
over
his
cap
and
he
had
her
bead
bag
on
his
arm
and
her
fan
that
he
got
out
of
the
best
room
and
he
come
with
little
short
steps
up
to
the
pew
and
i
he
set
by
the
door
but
no
he
made
to
go
by
us
up
into
the
corner
where
she
used
to
set
and
took
her
place
and
spread
his
dress
out
nice
and
got
his
handkerchief
out
o
his
bag
just
he
seen
her
do
he
took
off
his
bonnet
all
of
a
sudden
as
if
he
forgot
it
and
put
it
under
the
seat
like
he
did
his
hat
that
was
the
only
thing
he
did
that
any
woman
would
have
done
and
the
crown
of
his
cap
was
bent
some
i
thought
die
i
should
the
pew
was
one
of
them
up
aside
the
pulpit
a
square
one
you
know
right
at
the
end
of
the
aisle
so
i
could
see
the
length
of
it
and
out
of
the
door
and
there
stood
that
poor
boy
we
left
to
keep
the
company
looking
as
pale
as
ashes
we
found
he
tried
every
way
to
keep
the
old
gentleman
at
home
but
he
said
he
got
as
could
be
so
he
dare
to
say
no
more
and
gunn
drove
him
back
twice
to
the
house
and
that
why
he
got
in
so
late
i
did
know
but
it
was
the
boy
that
had
set
him
on
to
go
to
meeting
when
i
see
him
walk
in
and
i
could
wrung
his
neck
but
i
guess
i
misjudged
him
he
was
called
a
stiddy
boy
he
married
a
daughter
of
ichabod
pinkham
over
to
oak
plains
and
i
saw
a
son
of
his
when
i
was
taking
care
of
miss
west
last
spring
through
that
lung
fever
looked
like
his
father
i
wish
i
thought
to
tell
him
about
that
sunday
i
heard
he
was
waiting
on
that
pretty
becket
girl
the
orphan
one
that
lives
with
nathan
becket
her
father
and
mother
was
both
lost
at
sea
but
she
got
property
what
did
they
say
in
church
when
the
captain
came
in
aunt
polly
said
i
well
a
good
many
of
them
laughed
they
could
help
it
to
save
them
but
the
he
was
some
hard
o
hearin
so
he
never
noticed
it
and
he
set
there
in
the
corner
and
fanned
him
as
pleased
and
satisfied
as
could
be
the
singers
they
had
the
worst
time
but
they
had
just
come
to
the
end
of
a
verse
and
they
played
on
the
instruments
a
good
while
in
between
but
i
could
see
shake
and
i
the
tune
did
stray
a
little
though
they
went
through
it
well
and
after
the
first
fun
of
it
was
over
most
of
the
folks
felt
bad
you
see
the
had
been
very
much
looked
up
to
and
it
was
his
misfortune
and
he
set
there
quiet
listening
to
the
preaching
i
see
some
tears
in
some
o
the
old
eyes
they
hated
to
see
him
so
broke
in
his
mind
you
know
there
was
more
than
usual
of
out
that
day
they
knew
how
bad
he
feel
if
he
realized
it
a
good
christian
man
he
was
and
dreadful
precise
heard
say
did
he
ever
go
again
said
i
i
seem
to
forget
said
aunt
polly
i
dare
say
i
was
there
but
from
the
last
of
june
into
november
and
when
i
went
over
again
it
was
for
three
years
and
the
had
been
dead
some
time
his
mind
failed
him
more
and
more
along
at
the
last
but
i
tell
you
what
he
did
do
and
it
was
the
week
after
that
very
sunday
too
he
heard
it
given
out
from
the
pulpit
that
the
female
missionary
society
would
meet
with
mis
william
sands
the
thursday
night
o
that
week
the
sewing
society
you
know
and
he
looked
round
to
us
real
knowing
and
cousin
statiry
says
she
to
me
under
her
bonnet
do
he
want
to
go
and
i
like
to
have
laughed
right
out
but
sure
enough
he
did
and
what
do
you
suppose
but
he
made
us
fix
over
a
handsome
black
watered
silk
for
him
to
wear
that
had
been
his
sister
best
dress
he
said
he
outgrown
it
dreadful
quick
cousin
statiry
she
wished
to
heaven
she
thought
to
put
it
away
for
jacob
had
given
it
to
her
and
she
was
meaning
to
make
it
over
for
herself
but
it
did
do
to
cross
the
and
jacob
gunn
gave
statiry
another
one
the
best
he
could
get
but
it
was
near
so
good
a
piece
she
thought
he
set
everything
by
statiry
and
so
did
the
and
well
they
might
we
hoped
he
forget
all
about
it
the
next
day
but
he
did
and
i
always
thought
well
of
those
ladies
they
treated
him
so
handsome
and
tried
to
make
him
enjoy
himself
he
did
eat
a
great
supper
they
up
his
plate
with
everything
i
could
help
wondering
if
some
of
would
have
put
themselves
out
much
if
it
had
been
some
poor
flighty
old
woman
the
he
was
as
polite
as
could
be
and
when
jacob
come
to
walk
home
with
him
he
kissed
all
round
and
asked
to
meet
at
his
house
but
the
greatest
was
land
i
do
know
when
thought
so
much
about
those
times
one
afternoon
he
was
setting
at
home
in
the
and
statiry
was
there
and
deacon
abel
pinkham
stopped
in
to
see
jacob
gunn
about
building
some
fence
and
he
found
he
gone
to
mill
so
he
waited
a
while
talking
friendly
as
they
expected
jacob
might
be
home
and
the
was
as
pleased
as
could
be
and
he
urged
the
deacon
to
stop
to
tea
and
when
he
went
away
says
he
to
statiry
in
a
dreadful
knowing
way
of
us
do
you
consider
the
deacon
come
to
see
you
see
the
deacon
was
a
widower
bless
you
when
i
first
come
home
i
used
to
set
everybody
laughing
but
i
forget
most
of
the
things
now
there
was
one
day
though
here
comes
your
father
said
mrs
snow
now
we
must
let
him
go
by
or
you
have
to
walk
home
and
aunt
polly
hurried
out
to
speak
to
him
while
i
took
my
great
bunch
of
which
already
drooped
a
little
and
followed
her
with
mrs
snow
who
confided
to
me
that
the
captain
nephew
jacob
had
offered
to
polly
that
summer
she
was
over
there
and
she
never
could
see
why
she
did
have
him
only
love
goes
where
it
is
sent
and
polly
was
one
to
marry
for
what
she
could
get
if
she
did
like
the
man
there
was
plenty
that
would
have
said
yes
and
thank
you
too
sir
to
jacob
gunn
that
was
a
pleasant
afternoon
i
reached
home
when
it
was
growing
dark
and
chilly
and
the
early
autumn
sunset
had
almost
faded
in
the
west
it
was
a
much
longer
way
home
around
by
the
road
than
by
the
way
i
had
come
across
the
fields
a
mournful
lately
i
have
been
thinking
with
much
sorrow
of
the
approaching
extinction
of
front
yards
and
of
the
type
of
new
england
village
character
and
civilization
with
which
they
are
associated
formerly
because
i
lived
in
an
new
england
village
it
would
have
been
hard
for
me
to
imagine
that
there
were
parts
of
the
country
where
the
front
yard
as
i
knew
it
was
not
in
fashion
and
that
grounds
however
small
had
taken
its
place
no
matter
how
large
a
piece
of
land
lay
in
front
of
a
house
in
old
times
it
was
still
a
front
yard
in
spite
of
noble
dimension
and
the
skill
of
practiced
gardeners
there
are
still
a
good
many
examples
of
the
old
manner
of
life
and
customs
as
well
as
a
good
deal
of
the
provincial
society
left
in
the
eastern
parts
of
the
new
england
states
but
put
side
by
side
with
the
society
that
is
american
rather
than
provincial
one
discovers
it
to
be
in
a
small
minority
the
representative
united
states
citizen
will
be
or
already
is
a
westerner
and
his
instincts
and
ways
of
looking
at
things
have
certain
characteristics
of
their
own
which
are
steadily
growing
more
noticeable
for
many
years
new
england
was
simply
a
bit
of
old
england
transplanted
we
all
can
remember
elderly
people
whose
ideas
were
wholly
under
the
influence
of
their
english
ancestry
it
is
hardly
more
than
a
hundred
years
since
we
were
english
colonies
and
not
independent
united
states
and
the
customs
and
ideas
of
the
mother
country
were
followed
from
force
of
habit
now
one
begins
to
see
a
difference
the
old
traditions
have
had
time
to
almost
die
out
even
in
the
most
conservative
and
least
changed
towns
and
a
new
element
has
come
in
the
true
characteristics
of
american
society
as
i
have
said
are
showing
themselves
more
and
more
distinctly
to
the
westward
of
new
england
and
come
back
to
it
in
a
tide
that
steadily
sweeps
away
the
old
traditions
it
rises
over
the
heads
of
the
prim
and
stately
idols
before
which
our
grandfathers
and
grandmothers
bowed
down
and
worshiped
and
which
we
ourselves
were
at
least
taught
to
walk
softly
by
as
they
toppled
on
their
thrones
one
can
not
help
wondering
what
a
lady
of
the
old
school
will
be
like
a
hundred
years
from
now
but
at
any
rate
she
will
not
be
in
heart
and
thought
and
fashion
of
good
breeding
as
truly
an
englishwoman
as
if
she
had
never
stepped
out
of
great
britain
if
one
of
our
own
elderly
ladies
were
suddenly
dropped
into
the
midst
of
provincial
english
society
she
would
be
quite
at
home
but
west
of
her
own
hudson
river
she
is
lucky
if
she
does
not
find
herself
behind
the
times
and
almost
a
stranger
and
a
foreigner
and
yet
from
the
first
there
was
a
little
difference
and
the
colonies
were
new
england
and
not
old
in
some
ways
more
radical
yet
in
some
ways
more
conservative
than
the
people
across
the
water
they
showed
a
new
sort
of
flower
when
they
came
into
bloom
in
this
new
climate
and
soil
in
the
old
days
there
had
not
been
time
for
the
family
ties
to
be
broken
and
forgotten
instead
of
the
unknown
english
men
and
women
who
are
our
sixth
and
seventh
cousins
now
they
had
first
and
second
cousins
then
but
there
was
little
communication
between
one
country
and
the
other
and
the
mutual
interest
in
affairs
had
to
fade
out
quickly
a
traveler
was
a
curiosity
and
here
even
between
the
villages
themselves
there
was
far
less
intercourse
than
we
can
believe
possible
people
stayed
on
their
own
ground
their
horizons
were
of
small
circumference
and
their
whole
interest
and
thought
were
spent
upon
their
own
land
their
own
neighbors
their
own
affairs
while
they
not
only
were
contented
with
this
state
of
things
but
encouraged
it
one
has
only
to
look
at
the
pews
of
the
old
churches
at
the
high
fences
of
the
town
gardens
and
at
even
the
strong
fortifications
around
some
family
lots
in
the
to
be
sure
of
this
the
interviewer
was
not
besought
and
encouraged
in
those
days
he
was
defied
in
that
quarter
at
least
they
had
the
advantage
of
us
their
interest
was
as
real
and
heartfelt
in
each
other
affairs
as
ours
let
us
hope
but
they
never
allowed
idle
curiosity
to
show
itself
in
the
world
shameless
and
unblushing
there
is
so
much
to
be
said
in
favor
of
our
own
day
and
the
men
and
women
of
our
own
time
that
a
plea
for
a
recognition
of
the
quaintness
and
pleasantness
of
village
life
in
the
old
days
can
not
seem
unwelcome
or
without
deference
to
all
that
has
come
with
the
later
years
of
ease
and
comfort
or
of
discovery
in
the
realms
of
mind
or
matter
we
are
beginning
to
cling
to
the
elderly
people
who
are
so
different
from
ourselves
and
for
this
reason
we
are
paying
them
instinctively
the
honor
that
is
due
from
us
to
our
elders
and
betters
they
have
that
grand
prestige
and
dignity
that
only
comes
with
age
they
are
like
old
wines
perhaps
no
better
than
many
others
when
they
were
young
but
now
after
many
years
they
have
come
to
be
worth
nobody
knows
how
many
dollars
a
dozen
and
the
connoisseurs
make
treasures
of
the
few
bottles
of
that
vintage
which
are
left
it
was
a
restricted
and
narrowly
limited
life
in
the
old
days
religion
or
rather
sectarianism
was
apt
to
be
simply
a
matter
of
inheritance
and
there
was
far
more
bigotry
in
every
cause
and
question
a
fiercer
partisanship
and
because
there
were
fewer
channels
of
activity
and
those
undivided
into
specialties
there
was
a
concentration
of
energy
that
was
as
efficient
as
it
was
sometimes
narrow
and
people
were
more
contented
in
the
sphere
of
life
to
which
it
had
pleased
god
to
call
them
and
they
do
not
seem
to
have
been
so
often
sorely
tempted
by
the
devil
with
a
sight
of
the
kingdoms
of
the
world
and
the
glory
of
them
we
are
more
likely
to
busy
ourselves
with
finding
things
to
do
than
in
doing
with
our
might
the
work
that
is
in
our
hands
already
the
disappearance
of
many
of
the
village
front
yards
may
come
to
be
typical
of
the
altered
position
of
woman
and
mark
a
stronghold
on
her
way
from
the
much
slavery
and
subjection
to
a
coveted
equality
she
used
to
be
shut
off
from
the
wide
acres
of
the
farm
and
had
no
voice
in
the
world
politics
she
must
stay
in
the
house
or
only
hold
sway
out
of
doors
in
this
prim
corner
of
land
where
she
was
queen
no
wonder
that
women
clung
to
their
rights
in
their
then
and
no
wonder
that
they
have
grown
a
little
careless
of
them
now
and
that
lawn
mowers
find
so
ready
a
sale
the
whole
world
is
their
front
yard
nowadays
there
might
be
written
a
history
of
front
yards
in
new
england
which
would
be
very
interesting
to
read
it
would
end
in
a
treatise
upon
landscape
gardening
and
its
possibilities
and
wild
flights
of
imagination
about
the
culture
of
plants
under
glass
the
application
of
artificial
heat
in
forcing
and
the
curious
mingling
and
development
of
plant
life
but
it
would
begin
in
the
simple
time
of
the
early
colonists
it
must
have
been
hard
when
after
being
familiar
with
the
gardens
and
parks
of
england
and
holland
they
found
themselves
restricted
to
front
yards
by
way
of
pleasure
grounds
perhaps
they
thought
such
things
were
wrong
and
that
having
a
pleasant
place
to
walk
about
in
out
of
doors
would
encourage
idle
and
lawless
ways
in
the
young
at
any
rate
for
several
years
it
was
more
necessary
to
raise
corn
and
potatoes
to
keep
themselves
from
starving
than
to
lay
out
alleys
and
plant
flowers
and
box
borders
among
the
rocks
and
stumps
there
is
a
great
pathos
in
the
fact
that
in
so
stern
and
hard
a
life
there
was
time
or
place
for
any
gardens
at
all
i
can
picture
to
myself
the
little
slips
and
cuttings
that
had
been
brought
over
in
the
ship
and
more
carefully
guarded
than
any
of
the
household
goods
i
can
see
the
women
look
at
them
tearfully
when
they
came
into
bloom
because
nothing
else
could
be
a
better
reminder
of
their
old
home
what
fears
there
must
have
been
lest
the
first
winter
cold
might
kill
them
and
with
what
love
and
care
they
must
have
been
tended
i
know
a
and
a
little
while
ago
i
knew
an
that
were
brought
over
by
the
first
settlers
the
rose
still
blooms
and
until
it
was
cut
down
the
old
tree
bore
apples
it
is
strange
to
think
that
civilized
new
england
is
no
older
than
the
little
red
roses
that
bloom
in
june
on
that
slope
above
the
river
in
kittery
those
earliest
gardens
were
very
pathetic
in
the
contrast
of
their
extent
and
their
power
of
suggestion
and
association
every
seed
that
came
up
was
thanked
for
its
kindness
and
every
flower
that
bloomed
was
the
child
of
a
beloved
ancestry
it
would
be
interesting
to
watch
the
growth
of
the
gardens
as
life
became
easier
and
more
comfortable
in
the
colonies
as
the
settlements
grew
into
villages
and
towns
and
the
indians
were
less
dreadful
and
the
houses
were
better
and
more
the
busy
people
began
to
find
a
little
time
now
and
then
when
they
could
enjoy
themselves
soberly
beside
the
fruits
of
the
earth
they
could
have
some
flowers
and
a
sprig
of
sage
and
southernwood
and
tansy
or
lavender
that
had
come
from
surrey
and
could
be
dried
to
be
put
among
the
linen
as
it
used
to
be
strewn
through
the
chests
and
cupboards
in
the
old
country
i
like
to
think
of
the
changes
as
they
came
slowly
that
after
a
while
tender
plants
could
be
kept
through
the
winter
because
the
houses
were
better
built
and
warmer
and
were
no
longer
rough
shelters
which
were
only
meant
to
serve
until
there
could
be
something
better
perhaps
the
parlor
or
best
room
and
a
special
separate
garden
for
the
flowers
were
two
luxuries
of
the
same
date
and
they
made
a
noticeable
change
in
the
manner
of
living
the
best
room
being
a
formal
recognition
of
the
claims
of
society
and
the
front
yard
an
appeal
for
the
existence
of
something
that
gave
pleasure
beside
the
merely
useful
and
wholly
necessary
things
of
life
when
it
was
thought
worth
while
to
put
a
fence
around
the
the
respectability
of
art
itself
was
established
and
made
secure
whether
the
house
was
a
fine
one
and
its
inclosure
spacious
or
whether
it
was
a
small
house
with
only
a
narrow
bit
of
ground
in
front
this
yard
was
kept
with
care
and
it
was
different
from
the
rest
of
the
land
altogether
the
children
were
not
often
allowed
to
play
there
and
the
family
did
not
use
the
front
door
except
upon
occasions
of
more
or
less
ceremony
i
think
that
many
of
the
old
front
yards
could
tell
stories
of
the
lovers
who
found
it
hard
to
part
under
the
stars
and
lingered
over
the
gate
and
who
does
not
remember
the
solemn
group
of
men
who
gather
there
at
funerals
and
stand
with
their
heads
uncovered
as
the
mourners
go
out
and
come
in
two
by
two
i
have
always
felt
rich
in
the
possession
of
an
ancient
york
tradition
of
an
old
fellow
who
demanded
as
he
lay
dying
that
the
grass
in
his
front
yard
should
be
cut
at
once
it
was
no
use
to
have
it
trodden
down
and
spoilt
by
the
folks
at
the
funeral
i
always
hoped
it
was
good
hay
weather
but
he
must
have
been
certain
of
that
when
he
spoke
let
us
hope
he
did
not
confuse
this
world
with
the
next
being
so
close
upon
the
borders
of
it
it
was
not
to
think
of
the
front
yard
since
it
was
the
special
domain
of
the
women
the
men
of
the
family
respected
but
ignored
it
they
had
to
be
teased
in
the
spring
to
dig
the
flower
beds
but
it
was
the
busiest
time
of
the
year
one
should
remember
that
i
think
many
people
are
sorry
without
knowing
why
to
see
the
fences
pulled
down
and
the
disappearance
of
plain
white
palings
causes
almost
as
deep
regret
as
that
of
the
handsome
ornamental
fences
and
their
high
posts
with
urns
or
great
white
balls
on
top
a
stone
coping
does
not
make
up
for
the
loss
of
them
it
always
looks
a
good
deal
like
a
lot
in
a
cemetery
for
one
thing
and
then
in
a
small
town
the
grass
is
not
smooth
and
looks
uneven
where
the
were
not
properly
smoothed
down
the
stray
cows
trample
about
where
they
never
went
before
the
bushes
and
little
trees
that
were
once
protected
grow
ragged
and
scraggly
and
out
at
elbows
and
a
few
forlorn
flowers
come
up
of
themselves
and
try
hard
to
grow
and
to
bloom
the
ungainly
red
tubs
that
are
perched
on
little
posts
have
plants
in
them
but
the
poor
posies
look
as
if
they
would
rather
be
in
the
ground
and
as
if
they
are
held
too
near
the
fire
of
the
sun
if
everything
must
be
neglected
and
forlorn
so
much
the
more
reason
there
should
be
a
fence
if
but
to
hide
it
americans
are
too
fond
of
being
stared
at
they
apparently
feel
as
if
it
were
one
duty
to
one
neighbor
even
if
there
is
nothing
really
worth
looking
at
about
a
house
it
is
still
exposed
to
the
gaze
of
the
foreigners
are
far
more
sensible
than
we
and
the
home
life
among
them
is
something
we
might
well
try
to
copy
they
often
have
their
meals
served
out
of
doors
and
one
can
enjoy
an
afternoon
nap
in
a
hammock
or
can
take
one
work
out
into
the
shady
garden
with
great
satisfaction
unwatched
and
even
a
little
piece
of
ground
can
be
made
if
shut
in
and
kept
for
the
use
and
pleasure
of
the
family
alone
a
most
charming
unroofed
and
trellised
summer
to
the
house
in
a
large
crowded
town
it
would
be
selfish
to
conceal
the
rare
bits
of
garden
where
the
sight
of
anything
green
is
a
godsend
but
where
there
is
the
whole
wide
country
of
fields
and
woods
within
easy
reach
i
think
there
should
be
high
walls
around
our
gardens
and
that
we
lose
a
great
deal
in
not
making
them
entirely
separate
from
the
highway
as
much
as
we
should
lose
in
making
the
walls
of
our
parlors
and
of
glass
and
building
the
house
as
close
to
the
street
as
possible
but
to
go
back
to
the
little
front
yards
we
are
sorry
to
miss
them
and
their
tangle
or
orderliness
of
roses
and
larkspur
and
honeysuckle
canterbury
bells
and
london
pride
lilacs
and
peonies
these
may
all
bloom
better
than
ever
in
the
new
beds
that
are
cut
in
the
turf
but
with
the
side
fences
that
used
to
come
from
the
corners
of
the
house
to
the
front
fence
other
barriers
as
i
have
said
here
over
and
over
have
been
taken
away
and
the
village
life
is
becoming
extinct
people
do
not
know
what
they
lose
when
they
make
way
with
the
reserve
the
separateness
the
sanctity
of
the
front
yard
of
their
grandmothers
it
is
like
writing
down
the
family
secrets
for
any
one
to
read
it
is
like
having
everybody
call
you
by
your
first
name
and
sitting
in
any
pew
in
church
and
like
having
your
house
in
the
middle
of
a
road
to
take
away
the
fence
which
slight
as
it
may
be
is
a
fortification
round
your
home
more
things
than
one
may
come
in
without
being
asked
we
americans
had
better
build
more
fences
than
take
any
away
from
our
lives
there
should
be
gates
for
charity
to
go
out
and
in
and
kindness
and
sympathy
too
but
his
life
and
his
house
are
together
each
man
stronghold
and
castle
to
be
kept
and
defended
i
was
much
amused
once
at
thinking
that
the
fine
old
solid
paneled
doors
were
being
unhinged
faster
than
ever
nowadays
since
so
many
front
gates
have
disappeared
and
the
click
of
the
latch
can
no
longer
give
notice
of
the
approach
of
a
guest
now
the
knocker
sounds
or
the
bell
rings
without
note
or
warning
and
the
village
housekeeper
can
not
see
who
is
coming
in
until
they
have
already
reached
the
door
once
the
guests
could
be
seen
on
their
way
up
the
walk
it
must
be
a
satisfaction
to
look
through
the
clear
spots
of
the
figured
in
the
new
doors
and
i
believe
if
there
is
a
covering
inside
few
doors
will
be
found
unprovided
with
a
peephole
it
was
better
to
hear
the
gate
open
and
shut
and
if
it
caught
and
dragged
as
front
gates
are
very
apt
to
do
you
could
have
time
always
for
a
good
look
out
of
the
window
at
the
approaching
friend
there
are
few
of
us
who
can
not
remember
a
garden
which
seemed
to
us
a
very
paradise
in
childhood
it
was
like
a
miracle
when
the
yellow
and
white
daffies
came
into
bloom
in
the
spring
and
there
was
a
time
when
and
the
taller
were
taller
than
we
were
and
we
could
not
look
over
their
heads
as
we
do
now
there
were
always
a
good
many
that
grew
under
the
bushes
and
came
up
anywhere
in
the
chinks
of
the
walk
of
the
and
there
was
a
little
green
sprig
called
ambrosia
that
was
a
famous
outside
the
fence
one
was
not
unlikely
to
see
a
company
of
french
pinks
which
were
forbidden
inside
as
if
they
were
tiresome
poor
relations
of
the
other
flowers
i
always
felt
a
sympathy
for
french
pinks
they
have
a
fresh
sweet
look
as
if
they
resigned
themselves
to
their
lot
in
life
and
made
the
best
of
it
and
remembered
that
they
had
the
sunshine
and
rain
and
could
see
what
was
going
on
in
the
world
if
they
were
outlaws
i
like
to
remember
being
sent
on
errands
and
being
asked
to
wait
while
the
mistress
of
the
house
picked
some
flowers
to
send
back
to
my
mother
they
were
almost
always
prim
flat
bouquets
in
those
days
the
larger
flowers
were
picked
first
and
stood
at
the
back
and
looked
over
the
heads
of
those
that
were
shorter
of
stem
and
stature
and
the
givers
always
sent
a
message
that
they
had
not
stopped
to
arrange
them
i
remember
that
i
had
even
then
a
great
dislike
to
lemon
verbena
and
that
i
would
have
waited
patiently
outside
a
gate
all
the
afternoon
if
i
knew
that
some
one
would
kindly
give
me
a
sprig
of
lavender
in
the
evening
and
lilies
did
not
seem
to
me
overdressed
but
it
was
easy
for
me
to
believe
that
solomon
in
all
his
glory
was
not
arrayed
like
a
great
yellow
marigold
or
even
the
dear
little
single
ones
that
were
yellow
and
brown
and
bloomed
until
the
snow
came
i
wish
that
i
had
lived
for
a
little
while
in
those
days
when
lilacs
were
a
new
fashion
and
it
was
a
great
distinction
to
have
some
growing
in
a
front
yard
it
always
seems
as
if
lilacs
and
poplars
belonged
to
the
same
generation
with
a
certain
kind
of
new
english
gentlemen
and
ladies
who
were
ascetic
and
severe
in
some
of
their
fashions
while
in
others
they
were
more
given
to
pleasuring
and
mild
revelry
than
either
their
ancestors
or
the
people
who
have
lived
in
their
houses
since
fifty
years
ago
there
seems
to
have
been
a
last
tidal
wave
of
puritanism
which
swept
over
the
country
and
drowned
for
a
time
the
sober
feasting
and
dancing
which
before
had
been
considered
no
impropriety
in
the
larger
villages
was
clung
to
only
by
the
most
worldly
citizens
and
as
for
dancing
it
was
made
a
sin
in
itself
and
a
reproach
as
if
every
step
was
taken
willfully
in
boots
toward
a
place
which
is
to
be
the
final
destination
of
all
the
wicked
a
single
poplar
may
have
a
severe
and
uncharitable
look
but
a
row
of
them
suggests
the
antique
and
pleasing
pomp
and
ceremony
of
their
early
days
before
the
sideboard
cupboards
were
only
used
to
keep
the
boxes
of
strings
and
nails
and
the
duster
and
the
best
decanters
were
put
on
a
high
shelf
while
the
plain
ones
were
used
for
vinegar
in
the
kitchen
closet
there
is
far
less
social
visiting
from
house
to
house
than
there
used
to
be
people
in
the
smaller
towns
have
more
acquaintances
who
live
at
a
distance
than
was
the
case
before
the
days
of
railroads
and
there
are
more
guests
who
come
from
a
distance
which
has
something
to
do
with
making
and
the
entertainment
of
one
neighbors
less
frequent
than
in
former
times
but
most
of
the
new
england
towns
have
changed
their
characters
in
the
last
twenty
years
since
the
manufactories
have
come
in
and
brought
together
large
numbers
either
of
foreigners
or
of
a
different
class
of
people
from
those
who
used
to
make
the
most
of
the
population
a
certain
class
of
families
is
rapidly
becoming
extinct
there
will
be
found
in
the
older
villages
very
few
persons
left
who
belong
to
this
class
which
was
once
far
more
important
and
powerful
the
oldest
churches
are
apt
to
be
most
thinly
attended
simply
because
a
different
sort
of
ideas
even
of
heavenly
things
attract
the
newer
residents
i
suppose
that
elderly
people
have
said
ever
since
the
time
of
shem
ham
and
japhet
wives
in
the
ark
that
society
is
nothing
to
what
it
used
to
be
and
we
may
expect
to
be
always
told
what
unworthy
successors
we
are
of
our
grandmothers
but
the
fact
remains
that
a
certain
element
of
american
society
is
fast
dying
out
giving
place
to
the
new
and
with
all
our
glory
and
pride
in
modern
progress
and
success
we
cling
to
the
old
associations
regretfully
there
is
nothing
to
take
the
place
of
the
pleasure
we
have
in
going
to
see
our
old
friends
in
the
parlors
which
have
changed
little
since
our
childhood
no
matter
how
advanced
in
years
we
seem
to
ourselves
we
are
children
still
to
the
gracious
hostess
thank
heaven
for
the
friends
who
have
always
known
us
they
may
think
us
unreliable
and
young
still
they
may
not
understand
that
we
have
become
busy
and
more
or
less
important
people
to
ourselves
and
to
the
world
we
are
pretty
sure
to
be
without
honor
in
our
own
country
but
they
will
never
forget
us
and
we
belong
to
each
other
and
always
shall
i
have
received
many
kindnesses
at
my
friends
hands
but
i
do
not
know
that
i
have
ever
felt
myself
to
be
a
more
fortunate
or
honored
guest
than
i
used
years
ago
when
i
sometimes
went
to
call
upon
an
elderly
friend
of
my
mother
who
lived
in
most
pleasant
and
stately
fashion
i
used
to
put
on
my
very
best
manner
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
my
thoughts
were
well
ordered
and
my
conversation
as
proper
as
i
knew
how
to
make
it
i
can
remember
that
i
used
to
sit
on
a
tall
ottoman
with
nothing
to
lean
against
and
my
feet
were
off
soundings
i
was
so
high
above
the
floor
we
used
to
discuss
the
weather
and
i
said
that
i
went
to
school
sometimes
or
that
it
was
then
vacation
as
the
case
might
be
and
we
tried
to
make
ourselves
agreeable
to
each
other
presently
my
lady
would
take
her
keys
out
of
her
pocket
and
sometimes
a
maid
would
come
to
serve
me
or
else
she
herself
would
bring
me
a
silver
tray
with
some
baked
in
hearts
and
rounds
and
a
small
glass
of
wine
and
i
proudly
felt
that
i
was
a
guest
though
i
was
such
a
little
thing
an
attention
was
being
paid
me
and
a
thrill
of
satisfaction
used
to
go
over
me
for
my
consequence
and
importance
a
handful
of
would
have
seemed
nothing
beside
this
entertainment
i
used
to
be
careful
not
to
crumble
the
cake
and
i
used
to
eat
it
with
my
gloves
on
and
a
pleasant
fragrance
would
cling
for
some
time
afterward
to
the
ends
of
the
short
fingers
i
have
no
doubt
that
my
manners
as
i
took
leave
were
almost
as
distinguished
as
those
of
my
hostess
though
i
might
have
been
wild
and
shy
all
the
rest
of
the
week
it
was
not
many
years
ago
that
i
went
to
my
old
friend
funeral
and
saw
them
carry
her
down
the
long
wide
walk
between
the
tall
box
borders
which
were
her
pride
and
all
the
air
was
heavy
and
sweet
with
the
perfume
of
the
early
summer
blossoms
the
white
lilacs
and
the
flowering
currants
were
still
in
bloom
and
the
rows
of
her
dear
dutch
tulips
stood
dismayed
in
their
flaunting
colors
and
watched
her
go
away
my
sketch
of
the
already
or
fast
vanishing
village
fashions
perhaps
should
be
ended
here
but
i
can
not
resist
a
wish
to
add
another
bit
of
autobiography
of
which
i
have
been
again
and
again
reminded
in
writing
these
pages
the
front
yard
i
knew
best
belonged
to
my
grandfather
house
my
grandmother
was
a
proud
and
solemn
woman
and
she
hated
my
mischief
and
rightly
thought
my
elder
sister
a
much
better
child
than
i
used
to
be
afraid
of
her
when
i
was
in
the
house
but
i
shook
off
even
her
authority
and
forgot
i
was
under
anybody
rule
when
i
was
out
of
doors
i
was
first
cousin
to
a
caterpillar
if
they
called
me
to
come
in
and
i
was
own
sister
to
a
bobolink
when
i
ran
away
across
the
fields
as
i
used
to
do
very
often
but
when
i
was
a
very
little
child
indeed
my
world
was
bounded
by
the
fences
that
were
around
my
home
there
were
wide
green
yards
and
tall
to
shade
them
there
was
a
long
line
of
barns
and
sheds
and
one
of
these
had
a
large
room
in
its
upper
story
with
an
old
ship
foresail
spread
over
the
floor
and
made
a
capital
in
wet
weather
here
fruit
was
spread
in
the
fall
and
there
were
some
old
chests
and
pieces
of
furniture
that
had
been
discarded
it
was
like
the
garret
only
much
pleasanter
the
children
in
the
village
now
can
not
possibly
be
so
happy
as
i
was
then
i
used
to
mount
the
fence
next
the
street
and
watch
the
people
go
in
and
out
of
the
village
shops
that
stood
in
a
row
on
the
other
side
and
looked
as
if
they
belonged
to
a
dutch
or
old
english
town
they
were
burnt
down
long
ago
but
they
were
charmingly
picturesque
the
upper
stories
sometimes
projected
over
the
lower
and
the
chimneys
were
sometimes
clustered
together
and
built
of
bright
red
bricks
and
i
was
too
happy
when
i
could
smuggle
myself
into
the
front
yard
with
its
four
lilac
bushes
and
its
white
fences
to
shut
it
in
from
the
rest
of
the
world
beside
other
railings
that
went
from
the
porch
down
each
side
of
the
brick
walk
which
was
laid
in
a
pattern
and
had
cut
deeply
into
one
of
the
bricks
near
the
the
was
for
henry
currier
the
mason
who
had
signed
this
choice
bit
of
work
as
if
it
were
a
picture
and
he
had
been
dead
so
many
years
that
i
used
to
think
of
his
initials
as
if
the
corner
brick
were
a
little
for
him
the
knocker
used
to
be
so
bright
that
it
shone
at
you
and
caught
your
eye
bewilderingly
as
you
came
in
from
the
street
on
a
sunshiny
day
there
were
very
few
flowers
for
my
grandmother
was
old
and
feeble
when
i
knew
her
and
could
not
take
care
of
them
but
i
remember
that
there
were
blush
roses
and
white
roses
and
cinnamon
roses
all
in
a
tangle
in
one
corner
and
i
used
to
pick
the
crumpled
petals
of
those
to
make
myself
a
delicious
coddle
with
ground
cinnamon
and
damp
brown
sugar
in
the
spring
i
used
to
find
the
first
green
grass
there
for
it
was
warm
and
sunny
and
i
used
to
pick
the
little
french
pinks
when
they
dared
show
their
heads
in
the
cracks
of
the
that
were
laid
around
the
house
there
were
small
shoots
of
lilac
too
and
their
leaves
were
brown
and
had
a
faint
sweet
fragrance
and
a
little
later
the
dandelions
came
into
bloom
the
largest
ones
i
knew
grew
there
and
they
have
always
been
to
this
day
my
favorite
flowers
i
had
my
trials
and
sorrows
in
this
paradise
however
i
lost
a
cent
there
one
day
which
i
never
have
found
yet
and
one
morning
there
suddenly
appeared
in
one
corner
a
beautiful
and
i
joyfully
broke
its
neck
and
carried
it
into
the
house
but
everybody
had
seen
it
and
wondered
that
i
could
not
have
left
it
alone
besides
this
it
befell
me
later
to
sin
more
gravely
still
my
grandmother
had
kept
some
plants
through
the
winter
on
a
stand
built
like
a
flight
of
steps
and
when
the
warm
spring
weather
came
this
was
put
out
of
doors
she
had
a
cherished
bush
and
what
should
i
find
but
a
bud
on
it
it
was
opened
just
enough
to
give
a
hint
of
its
color
i
was
very
pleased
i
snapped
it
off
at
once
for
i
had
heard
so
many
times
that
it
was
hard
to
make
roses
bloom
and
i
ran
in
through
the
hall
and
up
the
stairs
where
i
met
my
grandmother
on
the
square
landing
she
sat
down
in
the
and
i
showed
her
proudly
what
was
crumpled
in
my
warm
little
fist
i
can
see
it
now
it
had
no
stem
at
all
and
for
many
days
afterward
i
was
bowed
down
with
a
sense
of
my
guilt
and
shame
for
i
was
made
to
understand
it
was
an
awful
thing
to
have
blighted
and
broken
a
treasured
flower
like
that
it
must
have
been
the
very
next
winter
that
my
grandmother
died
she
had
a
long
illness
which
i
do
not
remember
much
about
but
the
night
she
died
might
have
been
yesterday
night
it
is
all
so
fresh
and
clear
in
my
mind
i
did
not
live
with
her
in
the
old
house
then
but
in
a
new
house
close
by
across
the
yard
all
the
family
were
at
the
great
house
and
i
could
see
that
lights
were
carried
hurriedly
from
one
room
to
another
a
servant
came
to
fetch
me
but
i
would
not
go
with
her
my
grandmother
was
dying
whatever
that
might
be
and
she
was
taking
leave
of
every
one
she
was
ceremonious
even
then
i
did
not
dare
to
go
with
the
rest
i
had
an
intense
curiosity
to
see
what
dying
might
be
like
but
i
was
afraid
to
be
there
with
her
and
i
was
also
afraid
to
stay
at
home
alone
i
was
only
five
years
old
it
was
in
december
and
the
sky
seemed
to
grow
darker
and
darker
and
i
went
out
at
last
to
sit
on
a
and
cry
softly
to
myself
and
while
i
was
there
some
one
came
to
another
door
next
the
street
and
rang
the
bell
loudly
again
and
again
i
suppose
i
was
afraid
to
answer
the
summons
indeed
i
do
not
know
that
i
thought
of
it
all
the
world
had
been
still
before
and
the
bell
sounded
loud
and
awful
through
the
empty
house
it
seemed
as
if
the
messenger
from
an
unknown
world
had
come
to
the
wrong
house
to
call
my
poor
grandmother
away
and
that
loud
ringing
is
curiously
linked
in
my
mind
with
the
knocking
at
the
gate
in
macbeth
i
never
can
think
of
one
without
the
other
though
there
was
no
fierce
lady
macbeth
to
bid
me
not
be
lost
so
poorly
in
my
thoughts
for
when
they
all
came
back
awed
and
tearful
and
found
me
waiting
in
the
cold
alone
and
afraid
more
of
this
world
than
the
next
they
were
very
good
to
me
but
as
for
the
funeral
it
gave
me
vast
entertainment
it
was
the
first
grand
public
occasion
in
which
i
had
taken
any
share
october
it
was
a
fine
afternoon
just
warm
enough
and
just
cool
enough
and
i
started
off
alone
on
horseback
though
i
do
not
know
why
i
should
say
alone
when
i
find
my
horse
such
good
company
she
is
called
sheila
and
she
not
only
gratifies
one
sense
of
beauty
but
is
very
interesting
in
her
character
while
her
usefulness
in
this
world
is
beyond
question
i
grow
more
fond
of
her
every
week
we
have
had
so
many
capital
good
times
together
and
i
am
certain
that
she
is
as
much
pleased
as
i
when
we
start
out
for
a
run
i
do
not
say
to
every
one
that
i
always
pronounce
her
name
in
german
fashion
because
she
occasionally
shies
but
that
is
the
truth
i
do
not
mind
her
shying
or
a
certain
mysterious
and
apparently
unprovoked
jump
with
which
she
sometimes
indulges
herself
and
no
one
else
rides
her
so
i
think
she
does
no
harm
but
i
do
not
like
the
principle
of
allowing
her
to
be
wicked
unrebuked
and
unhindered
and
some
day
i
shall
give
my
mind
to
admonishing
this
princess
of
thule
who
seems
at
present
to
consider
herself
at
the
top
of
royalty
in
this
kingdom
or
any
other
i
believe
i
should
not
like
her
half
so
well
if
she
were
tamer
and
entirely
and
stupidly
reliable
i
glory
in
her
good
spirits
and
i
think
she
has
a
right
to
be
proud
and
willful
if
she
chooses
i
am
proud
myself
of
her
quick
eye
and
ear
her
sure
foot
and
her
slender
handsome
chestnut
head
i
look
at
her
points
of
high
breeding
with
admiration
and
i
thank
her
heartily
for
all
the
pleasure
she
has
given
me
and
for
what
i
am
sure
is
a
steadfast
friendship
between
us
and
a
mutual
understanding
that
rarely
knows
a
disappointment
or
a
mistake
she
is
careful
when
i
come
home
late
through
the
shadowy
twilighted
woods
and
i
can
hardly
see
my
way
she
forgets
then
all
her
little
tricks
and
capers
and
is
as
steady
as
a
clock
with
her
tramp
tramp
over
the
rough
dark
country
roads
i
feel
as
if
i
had
suddenly
grown
a
pair
of
wings
when
she
fairly
flies
over
the
ground
and
the
wind
whistles
in
my
ears
there
never
was
a
time
when
she
could
not
go
a
little
faster
but
she
is
willing
to
go
step
by
step
through
the
close
woods
pushing
her
way
through
the
branches
and
stopping
considerately
when
a
bough
that
will
not
bend
tries
to
pull
me
off
the
saddle
and
she
never
goes
away
and
leaves
me
when
i
dismount
to
get
some
flowers
or
a
drink
of
spring
water
though
sometimes
she
thinks
what
fun
it
would
be
i
can
not
speak
of
all
her
virtues
for
i
have
not
learned
them
yet
we
are
still
new
friends
for
i
have
only
ridden
her
two
years
and
i
feel
all
the
fascination
of
the
first
meeting
every
time
i
go
out
with
her
she
is
so
unexpected
in
her
ways
so
amusing
so
sensible
so
brave
and
in
every
way
so
delightful
a
horse
it
was
in
october
and
it
was
a
fine
day
to
look
at
though
some
of
the
great
clouds
that
sailed
through
the
sky
were
a
little
too
to
promise
good
weather
on
the
morrow
and
over
in
the
west
where
the
wind
was
coming
from
they
were
packed
close
together
and
looked
gray
and
wet
it
might
be
cold
and
cloudy
later
but
that
would
not
hinder
my
ride
it
is
a
capital
way
to
keep
warm
to
come
along
a
smooth
bit
of
road
on
the
run
and
i
should
have
time
at
any
rate
to
go
the
way
i
wished
so
sheila
trotted
quickly
through
the
gate
and
out
of
the
village
there
was
a
flicker
of
color
left
on
the
oaks
and
maples
and
though
it
was
not
weather
it
was
first
cousin
to
it
i
took
off
my
cap
to
let
the
wind
blow
through
my
hair
i
had
half
a
mind
to
go
down
to
the
sea
but
it
was
too
late
for
that
there
was
no
moon
to
light
me
home
sheila
took
the
strip
of
smooth
turf
just
at
the
side
of
the
road
for
her
own
highway
she
tossed
her
head
again
and
again
until
i
had
my
hand
full
of
her
thin
silky
mane
and
she
gave
quick
pulls
at
her
bit
and
hurried
little
jumps
ahead
as
if
she
expected
me
already
to
pull
the
reins
tight
and
steady
her
for
a
hard
gallop
i
patted
her
and
whistled
at
her
i
was
so
glad
to
see
her
again
and
to
be
out
riding
and
i
gave
her
part
of
her
reward
to
begin
with
because
i
knew
she
would
earn
it
and
then
we
were
on
better
terms
than
ever
she
has
such
a
pretty
way
of
turning
her
head
to
take
the
square
lump
of
sugar
and
she
never
bit
my
fingers
or
dropped
the
sugar
in
her
life
down
in
the
lower
part
of
the
town
on
the
edge
of
york
there
is
a
long
tract
of
woodland
covering
what
is
called
the
rocky
hills
rough
high
land
that
stretches
along
from
beyond
agamenticus
near
the
sea
to
the
upper
part
of
eliot
near
the
piscataqua
river
standing
on
agamenticus
the
woods
seem
to
cover
nearly
the
whole
of
the
country
as
far
as
one
can
see
and
there
is
hardly
a
clearing
to
break
this
long
reach
of
forest
of
which
i
speak
there
must
be
twenty
miles
of
it
in
an
almost
unbroken
line
the
roads
cross
it
here
and
there
and
one
can
sometimes
see
small
and
lonely
farms
hiding
away
in
the
heart
of
it
the
trees
are
for
the
most
part
young
growth
of
oak
or
pine
though
i
could
show
you
yet
many
a
noble
company
of
great
pines
that
once
would
have
been
marked
with
the
king
arrow
and
many
a
royal
old
oak
which
has
been
overlooked
in
the
search
for
ships
knees
and
plank
for
the
navy
yard
and
piles
for
the
always
shaky
and
down
pleasant
old
portsmouth
bridge
the
part
of
these
woods
which
i
know
best
lies
on
either
side
the
already
old
new
road
to
york
on
the
rocky
hills
and
here
i
often
ride
or
even
take
perilous
rough
drives
through
the
the
wood
roads
which
are
busy
thoroughfares
in
the
winter
and
are
silent
and
shady
narrowed
by
green
branches
and
carpeted
with
slender
brakes
and
seldom
traveled
over
except
by
me
all
summer
long
it
was
a
great
surprise
or
a
succession
of
surprises
one
summer
when
i
found
that
every
one
of
the
old
uneven
tracks
led
to
or
at
least
led
by
what
had
once
been
a
clearing
and
in
old
days
must
have
been
the
secluded
home
of
some
of
the
earliest
adventurous
farmers
of
this
region
it
must
have
taken
great
courage
i
think
to
strike
the
first
blow
of
one
axe
here
in
the
woods
and
it
must
have
been
a
brave
certainty
of
one
perseverance
that
looked
forward
to
the
smooth
field
which
was
to
succeed
the
unfruitful
wilderness
the
farms
were
far
enough
apart
to
be
very
lonely
and
i
suppose
at
first
the
cry
of
fierce
wild
creatures
in
the
forest
was
an
sound
and
the
indians
stole
like
snakes
through
the
bushes
and
crept
from
tree
to
tree
about
the
houses
watching
begging
and
plundering
over
and
over
again
there
are
some
of
these
farms
still
occupied
where
the
land
seems
to
have
become
thoroughly
civilized
but
most
of
them
were
deserted
long
ago
the
people
gave
up
the
fight
with
such
a
persistent
willfulness
and
wildness
of
nature
and
went
away
to
the
village
or
to
find
more
tractable
soil
and
kindlier
neighborhoods
i
do
not
know
why
it
is
these
silent
forgotten
places
are
so
delightful
to
me
there
is
one
which
i
always
call
my
farm
and
it
was
a
long
time
after
i
knew
it
well
before
i
could
find
out
to
whom
it
had
once
belonged
in
some
strange
way
the
place
has
become
a
part
of
my
world
and
to
belong
to
my
thoughts
and
my
life
i
suppose
every
one
can
say
i
have
a
little
kingdom
where
i
give
laws
each
of
us
has
truly
a
kingdom
in
thought
and
a
certain
spiritual
possession
there
are
some
gardens
of
mine
where
somebody
plants
the
seeds
and
pulls
the
weeds
for
me
every
year
without
my
ever
taking
a
bit
of
trouble
i
have
trees
and
fields
and
woods
and
seas
and
houses
i
own
a
great
deal
of
the
world
to
think
and
plan
and
dream
about
the
picture
belongs
most
to
the
man
who
loves
it
best
and
sees
entirely
its
meaning
we
can
always
have
just
as
much
as
we
can
take
of
things
and
we
can
lay
up
as
much
treasure
as
we
please
in
the
higher
world
of
thought
that
can
never
be
spoiled
or
hindered
by
moth
or
rust
as
lower
and
meaner
wealth
can
be
as
for
this
farm
of
mine
i
found
it
one
day
when
i
was
coming
through
the
woods
on
horseback
trying
to
strike
a
shorter
way
out
into
the
main
road
i
was
pushing
through
some
thick
underbrush
and
looking
ahead
i
noticed
a
good
deal
of
clear
sky
as
if
there
were
an
open
place
just
beyond
and
presently
i
found
myself
on
the
edge
of
a
clearing
there
was
a
straggling
orchard
of
old
the
grass
about
them
was
close
and
short
like
the
wide
of
an
old
and
into
this
cleared
space
the
little
pines
were
growing
on
every
side
the
old
pines
stood
a
little
way
back
watching
their
children
march
in
upon
their
inheritance
as
if
they
were
ready
to
interfere
and
protect
and
defend
if
any
trouble
came
i
could
see
that
it
would
not
be
many
years
if
they
were
left
alone
before
the
green
grass
would
be
covered
and
the
old
would
grow
mossy
and
die
for
lack
of
room
and
sunlight
in
the
midst
of
the
young
woods
it
was
a
perfect
acre
of
turf
only
here
and
there
i
could
already
see
a
cushion
of
juniper
or
a
tuft
of
sweet
fern
or
bayberry
i
walked
the
horse
about
slowly
picking
a
hard
little
yellow
apple
here
and
there
from
the
boughs
over
my
head
and
at
last
i
found
a
cellar
all
grown
over
with
grass
with
not
even
a
bit
of
a
crumbling
brick
to
be
seen
in
the
hollow
of
it
no
doubt
there
were
some
underground
it
was
a
very
large
cellar
twice
as
large
as
any
i
had
ever
found
before
in
any
of
these
deserted
places
in
the
woods
or
out
and
that
told
me
at
once
that
there
had
been
a
large
house
above
it
an
unusual
house
for
those
old
days
the
family
was
either
a
large
one
or
it
had
made
for
itself
more
than
a
merely
sufficient
covering
and
shelter
with
no
inch
of
unnecessary
room
i
knew
i
was
on
very
high
land
but
the
trees
were
so
tall
and
close
that
i
could
not
see
beyond
them
the
wind
blew
over
pleasantly
and
it
was
a
curiously
protected
and
hidden
place
sheltered
and
quiet
with
its
one
small
crop
of
cider
apples
dropping
ungathered
to
the
ground
and
unharvested
there
except
by
hurrying
black
ants
and
sticky
witless
little
snails
i
suppose
my
feeling
toward
this
place
was
like
that
about
a
ruin
only
this
seemed
older
than
a
ruin
i
could
not
hear
my
horse
and
an
apple
startled
me
when
it
fell
with
a
soft
thud
and
i
watched
it
roll
a
foot
or
two
and
then
stop
as
if
it
knew
it
never
would
have
anything
more
to
do
in
the
world
i
remembered
the
enchanted
palace
and
the
sleeping
beauty
in
the
wood
and
it
seemed
as
if
i
were
on
the
way
to
it
and
this
was
a
corner
of
that
palace
garden
the
horse
listened
and
stood
still
without
a
bit
of
restlessness
and
when
we
heard
the
far
cry
of
a
bird
she
looked
round
at
me
as
if
she
wished
me
to
notice
that
we
were
not
alone
in
the
world
after
all
it
was
strange
to
be
sure
that
people
had
lived
there
and
had
had
a
home
where
they
were
busy
and
where
the
fortunes
of
life
had
found
them
that
they
had
followed
out
the
law
of
existence
in
its
succession
of
growth
and
flourishing
and
failure
and
decay
within
that
steadily
narrowing
circle
of
trees
the
relationship
of
untamed
nature
to
what
is
tamed
and
cultivated
is
a
very
curious
and
subtle
thing
to
me
i
do
not
know
if
every
one
feels
it
so
intensely
in
the
darkness
of
an
early
autumn
evening
i
sometimes
find
myself
whistling
a
queer
tune
that
chimes
in
with
the
piping
and
the
cries
of
the
little
creatures
around
me
in
the
garden
i
have
no
thought
of
the
rest
of
the
world
i
wonder
what
i
am
there
is
a
strange
but
i
am
only
a
part
of
one
great
existence
which
is
called
nature
the
life
in
me
is
a
bit
of
all
life
and
where
i
am
happiest
is
where
i
find
that
which
is
next
of
kin
to
me
in
friends
or
trees
or
hills
or
seas
or
beside
a
flower
when
i
turn
back
more
than
once
to
look
into
its
face
the
world
goes
on
year
after
year
we
can
use
its
forces
and
shape
and
mould
them
and
perfect
this
thing
or
that
but
we
can
not
make
new
forces
we
only
use
the
tools
we
find
to
carve
the
wood
we
find
there
is
nothing
new
we
discover
and
combine
and
use
here
is
the
wild
fruit
the
same
fruit
at
heart
as
that
with
which
the
gardener
wins
his
prize
the
world
is
the
same
world
you
find
a
diamond
but
the
diamond
was
there
a
thousand
years
ago
you
did
not
make
it
by
finding
it
we
grow
spiritually
until
we
grasp
some
new
great
truth
of
god
but
it
was
always
true
and
waited
for
us
until
we
came
what
is
there
new
and
strange
in
the
world
except
ourselves
our
thoughts
are
our
own
god
gives
our
life
to
us
moment
by
moment
but
he
gives
it
to
be
our
own
ye
on
your
harps
must
lean
to
hear
a
secret
chord
that
mine
will
bear
as
i
looked
about
me
that
day
i
saw
the
difference
that
men
had
made
slowly
fading
out
of
sight
it
was
like
a
dam
in
a
river
when
it
is
once
swept
away
the
river
goes
on
the
same
as
before
the
old
patient
sublime
forces
were
there
at
work
in
their
appointed
way
but
perhaps
by
and
by
when
the
are
gone
and
the
cellar
is
only
a
rough
hollow
in
the
woods
some
one
will
again
set
aside
these
forces
that
have
worked
unhindered
and
will
bring
this
corner
of
the
world
into
a
new
use
and
shape
what
if
we
could
stop
or
change
forever
the
working
of
these
powers
but
nature
repossesses
herself
surely
of
what
we
boldly
claim
the
pyramids
stand
yet
it
happens
but
where
are
all
those
cities
that
used
also
to
stand
in
old
egypt
proud
and
strong
and
dating
back
beyond
men
memories
or
traditions
turned
into
sand
again
and
dust
that
is
like
all
the
rest
of
the
desert
and
blows
about
in
the
wind
yet
there
can
not
be
such
a
thing
as
life
that
is
lost
the
tree
falls
and
decays
in
the
dampness
of
the
woods
and
is
part
of
the
earth
under
foot
but
another
tree
is
growing
out
of
it
perhaps
it
is
part
of
its
own
life
that
is
springing
again
from
the
part
of
it
that
died
god
must
always
be
putting
again
to
some
use
the
life
that
is
withdrawn
it
must
live
because
it
is
life
there
can
be
no
confusion
to
god
in
this
wonderful
world
the
new
birth
of
the
immortal
the
new
forms
of
the
life
that
is
from
everlasting
to
everlasting
or
the
new
way
in
which
it
comes
but
it
is
only
god
who
can
plan
and
order
it
all
who
is
a
father
to
his
children
and
cares
for
the
least
of
us
i
thought
of
his
unbroken
promises
the
people
who
lived
and
died
in
that
lonely
place
knew
him
and
the
chain
of
events
was
fitted
to
their
thoughts
and
lives
for
their
development
and
education
the
world
was
made
for
them
and
god
keeps
them
yet
somewhere
in
his
kingdom
they
are
in
their
places
they
are
not
lost
while
the
trees
they
left
grow
older
and
the
young
trees
spring
up
and
the
fields
they
cleared
are
being
covered
over
and
turned
into
wild
land
again
i
had
visited
this
farm
of
mine
many
times
since
that
first
day
but
since
the
last
time
i
had
been
there
i
had
found
out
luckily
something
about
its
last
tenant
an
old
lady
whom
i
knew
in
the
village
had
told
me
that
when
she
was
a
child
she
remembered
another
very
old
woman
who
used
to
live
here
all
alone
far
from
any
neighbors
and
that
one
afternoon
she
had
come
with
her
mother
to
see
her
she
remembered
the
house
very
well
it
was
larger
and
better
than
most
houses
in
the
region
its
owner
was
the
last
of
her
family
but
why
she
lived
alone
or
what
became
of
her
at
last
or
of
her
money
or
her
goods
or
who
were
her
relatives
in
the
town
my
friend
did
not
know
she
was
a
thrifty
old
soul
a
famous
weaver
and
spinner
and
she
used
to
come
to
the
at
the
old
fields
every
sunday
and
sit
by
herself
in
a
square
pew
since
i
knew
this
the
last
owner
of
my
farm
has
become
very
real
to
me
and
i
thought
of
her
that
day
a
great
deal
and
could
almost
see
her
as
she
sat
alone
on
her
in
the
twilight
of
a
summer
evening
when
the
thrushes
were
calling
in
the
woods
or
going
down
the
hills
to
church
dressed
in
quaint
fashion
with
a
little
sadness
in
her
face
as
she
thought
of
her
lost
companions
and
how
she
did
not
use
to
go
to
church
alone
and
i
pictured
her
funeral
to
myself
and
watched
her
carried
away
at
last
by
the
narrow
road
that
wound
among
the
trees
and
there
was
nobody
left
in
the
house
after
the
neighbors
from
the
nearest
farms
had
put
it
to
rights
and
had
looked
over
her
treasures
to
their
hearts
content
she
must
have
been
a
fearless
woman
and
one
could
not
stay
in
such
a
place
as
this
year
in
and
year
out
through
the
long
days
of
summer
and
the
long
nights
of
winter
unless
she
found
herself
good
company
i
do
not
think
i
could
find
a
worse
avenue
than
that
which
leads
to
my
farm
i
think
sometimes
there
must
have
been
an
easier
way
out
which
i
have
yet
failed
to
discover
but
it
has
its
advantages
for
the
trees
are
beautiful
and
stand
close
together
and
i
do
not
know
such
green
brakes
anywhere
as
those
which
grow
in
the
shadiest
places
i
came
into
a
track
after
a
while
which
led
into
a
small
granite
quarry
and
then
i
could
go
faster
and
at
last
i
reached
a
pasture
wall
which
was
quickly
left
behind
and
i
was
only
a
little
way
from
the
main
road
there
were
a
few
young
cattle
scattered
about
in
the
pasture
and
some
of
them
which
were
lying
down
got
up
in
a
hurry
and
stared
at
me
suspiciously
as
i
rode
along
it
was
very
uneven
ground
and
i
passed
some
stiff
straight
mullein
stalks
which
stood
apart
together
in
a
hollow
as
if
they
wished
to
be
alone
they
always
remind
me
of
the
rigid
old
scotch
covenanters
who
used
to
gather
themselves
together
in
companies
against
the
law
to
worship
god
in
some
secret
hollow
of
the
bleak
even
the
smallest
and
youngest
of
the
mulleins
was
a
covenanter
at
heart
they
had
all
put
by
their
yellow
flowers
and
they
will
stand
there
gray
and
unbending
through
the
fall
rains
and
winter
snows
to
keep
their
places
and
praise
god
in
their
own
fashion
and
they
take
great
credit
to
themselves
for
doing
it
i
have
no
doubt
and
think
it
is
far
better
to
be
a
stern
and
respectable
mullein
than
a
straying
idle
clematis
that
clings
and
wanders
and
can
not
bear
wet
weather
i
saw
members
of
the
congregation
scattered
through
the
pasture
and
felt
like
telling
them
to
hurry
for
the
long
sermon
had
already
begun
but
one
ancient
worthy
very
late
on
his
way
to
the
meeting
happened
to
stand
in
our
way
and
sheila
bit
his
dry
head
off
which
was
a
great
pity
after
i
was
once
on
the
high
road
it
was
not
long
before
i
found
myself
in
another
part
of
the
town
altogether
it
is
great
fun
to
ride
about
the
country
one
rouses
a
great
deal
of
interest
there
seems
to
be
something
exciting
in
the
sight
of
a
girl
on
horseback
and
people
who
pass
you
in
wagons
turn
to
look
after
you
though
they
never
would
take
the
trouble
if
you
were
only
walking
the
country
horses
shy
if
you
go
by
them
fast
and
sometimes
you
stop
to
apologize
the
boys
will
leave
anything
to
come
and
throw
a
stone
at
your
horse
i
think
sheila
would
like
to
bite
a
boy
though
sometimes
she
goes
through
her
best
paces
when
she
hears
them
hooting
as
if
she
thought
they
were
admiring
her
which
i
never
allow
myself
to
doubt
it
is
considered
a
much
greater
compliment
if
you
make
a
call
on
horseback
than
if
you
came
afoot
but
carriage
people
are
nothing
in
the
country
to
what
they
are
in
the
city
i
was
on
a
good
road
and
sheila
was
trotting
steadily
and
i
did
not
look
at
the
western
sky
behind
me
until
i
suddenly
noticed
that
the
air
had
grown
colder
and
the
sun
had
been
for
a
long
time
behind
a
cloud
then
i
found
there
was
going
to
be
a
shower
in
a
very
little
while
too
i
was
in
a
thinly
settled
part
of
the
town
and
at
first
i
could
not
think
of
any
shelter
until
i
remembered
that
not
very
far
distant
there
was
an
old
house
with
a
long
sloping
roof
which
had
formerly
been
the
parsonage
of
the
north
parish
there
had
once
been
a
church
near
by
to
which
most
of
the
people
came
who
lived
in
this
upper
part
of
the
town
it
had
been
for
many
years
the
house
of
an
old
minister
of
widespread
fame
in
his
day
i
had
always
heard
of
him
from
the
elderly
people
and
i
had
often
thought
i
should
like
to
go
into
his
house
and
had
looked
at
it
with
great
interest
but
until
within
a
year
or
two
there
had
been
people
living
there
i
had
even
listened
with
pleasure
to
a
story
of
its
being
haunted
and
this
was
a
capital
chance
to
take
a
look
at
the
old
place
so
i
hurried
toward
it
as
i
went
in
at
the
broken
gate
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
the
house
might
have
been
shut
up
and
left
to
itself
fifty
years
before
when
the
minister
died
so
soon
the
grass
grows
up
after
men
footsteps
have
worn
it
down
and
the
traces
are
lost
of
the
daily
touch
and
care
of
their
hands
the
home
lot
was
evidently
part
of
a
pasture
and
the
sheep
had
nibbled
close
to
the
while
tags
of
their
long
spring
wool
washed
clean
by
summer
rains
were
caught
in
the
near
by
it
had
been
a
very
good
house
in
its
day
and
had
a
dignity
of
its
own
holding
its
gray
head
high
as
if
it
knew
itself
to
be
not
merely
a
but
a
parsonage
the
roof
looked
as
if
the
next
weight
of
snow
might
break
it
in
and
the
window
panes
had
been
loosened
so
much
in
their
shaking
frames
that
many
of
them
had
fallen
out
on
the
north
side
of
the
house
and
were
lying
on
the
long
grass
underneath
blurred
and
thin
but
still
unbroken
that
was
the
last
letter
of
the
house
death
warrant
for
now
the
rain
could
get
in
and
the
crumbling
timbers
must
loose
their
hold
of
each
other
quickly
i
had
found
a
dry
corner
of
the
old
shed
for
the
horse
and
left
her
there
looking
most
ruefully
over
her
shoulder
after
me
as
i
hurried
away
for
the
rain
had
already
begun
to
spatter
down
in
earnest
i
was
not
sorry
when
i
found
that
somebody
had
broken
a
pane
of
glass
in
the
sidelight
of
the
front
door
near
the
latch
and
i
was
very
pleased
when
i
found
that
by
reaching
through
i
could
unfasten
a
great
bolt
and
let
myself
in
as
perhaps
some
tramp
in
search
of
shelter
had
done
before
me
however
i
gave
the
blackened
brass
knocker
a
ceremonious
rap
or
two
and
i
could
have
told
by
the
sound
of
it
if
in
no
other
way
that
there
was
nobody
at
home
i
looked
up
to
see
a
robin
nest
on
the
cornice
overhead
and
i
had
to
push
away
the
lilacs
and
a
withered
hop
vine
which
were
both
trying
to
cover
up
the
door
it
gives
one
a
strange
feeling
i
think
to
go
into
an
empty
house
so
old
as
this
it
was
so
still
there
that
the
noise
my
footsteps
made
startled
me
and
the
floor
creaked
and
cracked
as
if
some
one
followed
me
about
there
was
hardly
a
straw
left
or
a
bit
of
string
or
paper
but
the
rooms
were
much
worn
the
bricks
in
the
were
burnt
out
rough
and
crumbling
and
the
doors
were
all
worn
smooth
and
round
at
the
edges
the
best
rooms
were
wainscoted
but
there
was
a
long
unfinished
room
with
a
little
square
window
at
each
end
under
the
sloping
roof
and
as
i
listened
there
to
the
rain
i
remembered
that
i
had
once
heard
an
old
man
say
wistfully
that
he
had
slept
in
just
such
a
linter
chamber
as
this
when
he
was
a
boy
and
that
he
never
could
sleep
anywhere
now
so
well
as
he
used
there
while
the
rain
fell
on
the
roof
just
over
his
bed
i
found
a
room
which
i
knew
must
have
been
the
study
it
was
handsomely
wainscoted
and
the
finish
of
it
was
even
better
than
that
of
the
parlor
it
must
have
been
a
most
comfortable
place
and
i
fear
the
old
parson
was
luxurious
in
his
tastes
and
less
ascetic
perhaps
than
the
more
puritanical
members
of
his
congregation
approved
there
was
a
great
with
a
broad
where
i
think
he
may
have
made
a
mug
of
flip
sometimes
and
there
were
several
curious
narrow
little
cupboards
built
into
the
wall
at
either
side
and
over
the
itself
two
doors
opened
and
there
were
shelves
inside
broader
at
the
top
as
the
chimney
sloped
back
i
saw
some
writing
on
one
of
these
doors
and
went
nearer
to
read
it
there
was
a
date
at
the
top
some
time
in
and
his
reverence
had
had
a
good
quill
pen
and
ink
which
bravely
stood
the
test
of
time
he
must
have
been
a
tall
man
to
have
written
so
high
i
thought
it
might
be
some
record
of
a
great
storm
or
other
notable
event
in
his
house
or
parish
but
i
was
amused
to
find
that
he
had
written
there
on
the
unpainted
wood
some
valuable
recipes
for
the
medical
treatment
of
horses
it
is
useful
for
a
sprain
and
for
a
cough
take
of
elecampane
and
so
on
i
hope
he
was
not
a
hunting
parson
but
one
could
hardly
expect
to
find
any
reference
to
the
early
fathers
or
federal
in
adam
on
the
cupboard
door
i
thought
of
the
stories
i
had
heard
of
the
old
minister
and
felt
very
well
acquainted
with
him
though
his
books
had
been
taken
down
and
his
fire
was
out
and
he
himself
had
gone
away
i
was
glad
to
think
what
a
good
faithful
man
he
was
who
spoke
comfortable
words
to
his
people
and
lived
pleasantly
with
them
in
this
quiet
country
place
so
many
years
there
are
old
people
living
who
have
told
me
that
nobody
preaches
nowadays
as
he
used
to
preach
and
that
he
used
to
lift
his
hat
to
everybody
that
he
liked
a
good
dinner
and
always
was
kind
to
the
poor
i
thought
as
i
stood
in
the
study
how
many
times
he
must
have
looked
out
of
the
western
windows
across
the
fields
and
how
in
his
later
days
he
must
have
had
a
treasure
of
memories
of
the
people
who
had
gone
out
of
that
room
the
better
for
his
advice
and
consolation
the
people
whom
he
had
helped
and
taught
and
ruled
i
could
not
imagine
that
he
ever
angrily
took
his
parishioners
to
task
for
their
errors
of
doctrine
indeed
it
was
not
of
his
active
youth
and
middle
age
that
i
thought
at
all
but
of
the
last
of
his
life
when
he
sat
here
in
the
sunshine
of
a
winter
afternoon
and
the
fire
flickered
and
snapped
on
the
hearth
and
he
sat
before
it
in
his
with
a
brown
old
book
which
he
laid
on
his
knee
while
he
thought
and
dozed
and
roused
himself
presently
to
greet
somebody
who
came
in
a
little
awed
at
first
to
talk
with
him
it
was
a
great
thing
to
be
a
country
minister
in
those
old
days
and
to
be
such
a
minister
as
he
was
truly
the
priest
and
ruler
of
his
people
the
times
have
changed
and
the
temporal
power
certainly
is
taken
away
the
divine
right
of
ministers
is
almost
as
little
believed
in
as
that
of
kings
by
many
people
it
is
not
possible
for
the
influence
to
be
so
great
the
office
and
the
man
are
both
looked
at
with
less
reverence
it
is
a
pity
that
it
should
be
so
but
the
conservative
people
who
like
ways
can
not
tell
where
to
place
all
the
blame
and
it
is
very
odd
to
think
that
these
iconoclastic
and
unpleasant
new
times
of
ours
will
a
little
later
be
called
old
times
and
that
the
children
when
they
are
elderly
people
will
sigh
to
have
them
back
again
i
was
very
glad
to
see
the
old
house
and
i
told
myself
a
great
many
stories
there
as
one
can
not
help
doing
in
such
a
place
there
must
have
been
so
many
things
happen
in
so
many
long
lives
which
were
lived
there
people
have
come
into
the
world
and
gone
out
of
it
again
from
those
square
rooms
with
their
little
windows
and
i
believe
if
there
are
ghosts
who
walk
about
in
daylight
i
was
only
half
deaf
to
their
voices
and
heard
much
of
what
they
tried
to
tell
me
that
day
the
rooms
which
had
looked
empty
at
first
were
filled
again
with
the
old
clergymen
who
met
together
with
important
looks
and
complacent
dignity
and
eager
talk
about
some
minor
point
in
theology
that
is
yet
unsettled
the
awkward
smiling
couples
who
came
to
be
married
the
mistress
of
the
house
who
must
have
been
a
stately
person
in
her
day
the
little
children
who
under
all
their
shyness
remembered
the
in
the
old
pockets
all
these
and
even
the
tall
cane
that
must
have
stood
in
the
entry
were
visible
to
my
mind
eye
and
i
even
heard
a
sermon
from
the
old
preacher
who
died
so
long
ago
on
the
beauty
of
a
life
well
spent
the
rain
fell
steadily
and
there
was
no
prospect
of
its
stopping
though
i
could
see
that
the
clouds
were
thinner
and
that
it
was
only
a
shower
in
the
kitchen
i
found
an
old
chair
which
i
pulled
into
the
study
which
seemed
more
cheerful
than
the
rest
of
the
house
and
then
i
remembered
that
there
were
some
bits
of
board
in
the
kitchen
also
and
the
thought
struck
me
that
it
would
be
good
fun
to
make
a
fire
in
the
old
everything
seemed
right
about
the
chimney
i
even
went
up
into
the
garret
to
look
at
it
there
for
i
had
no
wish
to
set
the
parsonage
on
fire
and
i
brought
down
a
pile
of
old
corn
husks
for
kindlings
which
i
found
on
the
garret
floor
i
built
my
fire
carefully
with
two
bricks
for
andirons
and
when
i
lit
it
it
blazed
up
gayly
i
poked
it
and
it
crackled
and
though
i
was
very
well
contented
there
alone
i
wished
for
some
friend
to
keep
me
company
it
was
selfish
to
have
so
much
pleasure
with
no
one
to
share
it
the
rain
came
faster
than
ever
against
the
windows
and
the
room
would
have
been
dark
if
it
had
not
been
for
my
fire
which
threw
out
a
magnificent
yellow
light
over
the
old
brown
i
leaned
back
and
watched
the
dry
sticks
fall
apart
in
red
coals
and
thought
i
might
have
to
spend
the
night
there
for
if
it
were
a
storm
and
not
a
shower
i
was
several
miles
from
home
and
a
late
october
rain
is
not
like
a
warm
one
in
june
to
fall
upon
one
shoulders
i
could
hear
the
house
leaking
when
it
rained
less
heavily
and
the
soot
dropped
down
the
chimney
and
great
drops
of
water
came
down
too
and
spluttered
in
the
fire
i
thought
what
a
merry
thing
it
would
be
if
a
party
of
young
people
ever
had
to
take
refuge
there
and
i
could
almost
see
their
faces
and
hear
them
laugh
though
until
that
minute
they
had
been
strangers
to
me
but
the
shower
was
over
at
last
and
my
fire
was
out
and
the
last
pale
shining
of
the
sun
came
into
the
windows
and
i
looked
out
to
see
the
distant
fields
and
woods
all
clear
again
in
the
late
afternoon
light
i
must
hurry
to
get
home
before
dark
so
i
raked
up
the
ashes
and
left
my
chair
beside
the
and
shut
and
fastened
the
front
door
after
me
and
went
out
to
see
what
had
become
of
my
horse
shaking
the
dust
and
cobwebs
off
my
dress
as
i
crossed
the
wet
grass
to
the
shed
the
rain
had
come
through
the
broken
roof
and
poor
sheila
looked
anxious
and
hungry
as
if
she
thought
i
might
have
meant
to
leave
her
there
till
morning
in
that
dismal
place
i
offered
her
my
apologies
but
she
made
even
a
shorter
turn
than
usual
when
i
had
mounted
and
we
scurried
off
down
the
road
spattering
ourselves
as
we
went
i
hope
the
ghosts
who
live
in
the
parsonage
watched
me
with
friendly
eyes
and
i
looked
back
myself
to
see
a
thin
blue
whiff
of
smoke
still
coming
up
from
the
great
chimney
i
wondered
who
it
was
that
had
made
the
first
fire
there
but
i
think
i
shall
have
made
the
last
i
shall
not
dwell
long
upon
the
circumstances
that
led
to
the
marriage
of
my
hero
and
heroine
though
their
courtship
was
to
them
the
only
one
that
has
ever
noticeably
approached
the
ideal
it
had
many
aspects
in
which
it
was
entirely
commonplace
in
other
people
eyes
while
the
world
in
general
smiles
at
lovers
with
kindly
approval
and
sympathy
it
refuses
to
be
aware
of
the
unprecedented
delight
which
is
amazing
to
the
lovers
themselves
but
as
has
been
true
in
many
other
cases
when
they
were
at
last
married
the
most
ideal
of
situations
was
found
to
have
been
changed
to
the
most
practical
instead
of
having
shared
their
original
duties
and
as
would
say
going
halves
they
discovered
that
the
cares
of
life
had
been
doubled
this
led
to
some
distressing
moments
for
both
our
friends
they
understood
suddenly
that
instead
of
dwelling
in
heaven
they
were
still
upon
earth
and
had
made
themselves
slaves
to
new
laws
and
limitations
instead
of
being
freer
and
happier
than
ever
before
they
had
assumed
new
responsibilities
they
had
established
a
new
household
and
must
fulfill
in
some
way
or
another
the
obligations
of
it
they
looked
back
with
affection
to
their
engagement
they
had
been
longing
to
have
each
other
to
themselves
apart
from
the
world
but
it
seemed
that
they
never
felt
so
keenly
that
they
were
still
units
in
modern
society
since
adam
and
eve
were
in
paradise
before
the
devil
joined
them
nobody
has
had
a
chance
to
imitate
that
unlucky
couple
in
some
respects
they
told
the
truth
when
twenty
times
a
day
they
said
that
life
had
never
been
so
pleasant
before
but
there
were
mental
reservations
on
either
side
which
might
have
subjected
them
to
the
accusation
of
lying
somehow
there
was
a
little
feeling
of
disappointment
and
they
caught
themselves
wondering
though
they
would
have
died
sooner
than
confess
it
whether
they
were
quite
so
happy
as
they
had
expected
the
truth
was
they
were
much
happier
than
people
usually
are
for
they
had
an
uncommon
capacity
for
enjoyment
for
a
little
while
they
were
like
a
that
is
beating
and
has
to
drift
a
few
minutes
before
it
can
catch
the
wind
and
start
off
on
the
other
tack
and
they
had
the
same
feeling
too
that
any
one
is
likely
to
have
who
has
been
long
pursuing
some
object
of
his
ambition
or
desire
whether
it
is
a
coin
or
a
picture
or
a
stray
volume
of
some
old
edition
of
shakespeare
or
whether
it
is
an
office
under
government
or
a
lover
when
fairly
in
one
grasp
there
is
a
loss
of
the
eagerness
that
was
felt
in
pursuit
satisfaction
even
after
one
has
dined
well
is
not
so
interesting
and
eager
a
feeling
as
hunger
my
hero
and
heroine
were
reasonably
well
established
to
begin
with
they
each
had
some
money
though
wilson
had
most
his
father
had
at
one
time
been
a
rich
man
but
with
the
decline
a
few
years
before
of
manufacturing
interests
he
had
become
mostly
through
the
fault
of
others
somewhat
involved
and
at
the
time
of
his
death
his
affairs
were
in
such
a
condition
that
it
was
still
a
question
whether
a
very
large
sum
or
a
moderately
large
one
would
represent
his
estate
wilson
tom
was
somewhat
of
an
invalid
she
suffered
severely
at
times
with
asthma
but
she
was
almost
entirely
relieved
by
living
in
another
part
of
the
country
while
her
husband
lived
she
had
accepted
her
illness
as
inevitable
and
rarely
left
home
but
during
the
last
few
years
she
had
lived
in
philadelphia
with
her
own
people
making
short
and
wheezing
visits
only
from
time
to
time
and
had
not
undergone
a
voluntary
period
of
suffering
since
the
occasion
of
tom
marriage
which
she
had
entirely
approved
she
had
a
sufficient
property
of
her
own
and
she
and
tom
were
independent
of
each
other
in
that
way
her
only
other
stepchild
was
a
daughter
who
had
married
a
navy
officer
and
had
at
this
time
gone
out
to
spend
three
years
or
less
with
her
husband
who
had
been
ordered
to
japan
it
is
not
unfrequently
noticed
that
in
many
marriages
one
of
the
persons
who
choose
each
other
as
partners
for
life
is
said
to
have
thrown
himself
or
herself
away
and
the
relatives
and
friends
look
on
with
dismal
forebodings
and
submission
in
this
case
it
was
the
wife
who
might
have
done
so
much
better
according
to
public
opinion
she
did
not
think
so
herself
luckily
either
before
marriage
or
afterward
and
i
do
not
think
it
occurred
to
her
to
picture
to
herself
the
sort
of
career
which
would
have
been
her
alternative
she
had
been
an
only
child
and
had
usually
taken
her
own
way
some
one
once
said
that
it
was
a
great
pity
that
she
had
not
been
obliged
to
work
for
her
living
for
she
had
inherited
a
most
uncommon
business
talent
and
without
being
disreputably
keen
at
a
bargain
her
insight
into
the
practical
working
of
affairs
was
very
clear
and
her
father
who
had
also
been
a
manufacturer
like
tom
had
often
said
it
had
been
a
mistake
that
she
was
a
girl
instead
of
a
boy
such
executive
ability
as
hers
is
often
wasted
in
the
more
contracted
sphere
of
women
and
is
apt
to
be
more
a
disadvantage
than
a
help
she
was
too
independent
and
for
a
wife
it
would
seem
at
first
thought
that
she
needed
a
wife
herself
more
than
she
did
a
husband
most
men
like
best
the
women
whose
natures
cling
and
appeal
to
theirs
for
protection
but
tom
wilson
while
he
did
not
wish
to
be
protected
himself
liked
these
very
qualities
in
his
wife
which
would
have
displeased
some
other
men
to
tell
the
truth
he
was
very
much
in
love
with
his
wife
just
as
she
was
he
was
a
successful
collector
of
almost
everything
but
money
and
during
a
great
part
of
his
life
he
had
been
an
invalid
and
he
had
grown
as
he
laughingly
confessed
very
he
had
been
badly
lamed
when
a
boy
by
being
caught
in
some
machinery
in
his
father
mill
near
which
he
was
idling
one
afternoon
and
though
he
had
almost
entirely
outgrown
the
effect
of
his
injury
it
had
not
been
until
after
many
years
he
had
been
in
college
but
his
eyes
had
given
out
there
and
he
had
been
obliged
to
leave
in
the
middle
of
his
junior
year
though
he
had
kept
up
a
pleasant
intercourse
with
the
members
of
his
class
with
whom
he
had
been
a
great
favorite
he
was
a
good
deal
of
an
idler
in
the
world
i
do
not
think
his
ambition
except
in
the
case
of
securing
mary
dunn
for
his
wife
had
ever
been
distinct
he
seemed
to
make
the
most
he
could
of
each
day
as
it
came
without
making
all
his
days
works
tend
toward
some
grand
result
and
go
toward
the
upbuilding
of
some
grand
plan
and
purpose
he
consequently
gave
no
promise
of
being
either
distinguished
or
great
when
his
eyes
would
allow
he
was
an
indefatigable
reader
and
although
he
would
have
said
that
he
read
only
for
amusement
yet
he
amused
himself
with
books
that
were
well
worth
the
time
he
spent
over
them
the
house
where
he
lived
nominally
belonged
to
his
but
she
had
taken
for
granted
that
tom
would
bring
his
wife
home
to
it
and
assured
him
that
it
should
be
to
all
intents
and
purposes
his
tom
was
deeply
attached
to
the
old
place
which
was
altogether
the
pleasantest
in
town
he
had
kept
bachelor
hall
there
most
of
the
time
since
his
father
death
and
he
had
taken
great
pleasure
before
his
marriage
in
refitting
it
to
some
extent
though
it
was
already
comfortable
and
furnished
in
remarkably
good
taste
people
said
of
him
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
his
illnesses
and
if
he
had
been
a
poor
boy
he
probably
would
have
made
something
of
himself
as
it
was
he
was
not
very
well
known
by
the
being
somewhat
reserved
and
not
taking
much
interest
in
their
subjects
of
conversation
nobody
liked
him
so
well
as
they
liked
his
wife
yet
there
was
no
reason
why
he
should
be
disliked
enough
to
have
much
said
about
him
after
our
friends
had
been
married
for
some
time
and
had
outlived
the
first
strangeness
of
the
new
order
of
things
and
had
done
their
duty
to
their
neighbors
with
so
much
apparent
willingness
and
generosity
that
even
tom
himself
was
liked
a
great
deal
better
than
he
ever
had
been
before
they
were
sitting
together
one
stormy
evening
in
the
library
before
the
fire
wilson
had
been
reading
tom
the
letters
which
had
come
to
him
by
the
night
mail
there
was
a
long
one
from
his
sister
in
nagasaki
which
had
been
written
with
a
good
deal
of
reproach
she
complained
of
the
smallness
of
the
income
of
her
share
in
her
father
estate
and
said
that
she
had
been
assured
by
american
friends
that
the
smaller
mills
were
starting
up
everywhere
and
beginning
to
do
well
again
since
so
much
of
their
money
was
invested
in
the
factory
she
had
been
surprised
and
sorry
to
find
by
tom
last
letters
that
he
had
seemed
to
have
no
idea
of
putting
in
a
proper
person
as
superintendent
and
going
to
work
again
four
per
cent
on
her
other
property
which
she
had
been
told
she
must
soon
expect
instead
of
eight
would
make
a
great
difference
to
her
a
navy
captain
in
a
foreign
port
was
obliged
to
entertain
a
great
deal
and
tom
must
know
that
it
cost
them
much
more
to
live
than
it
did
him
and
ought
to
think
of
their
interests
she
hoped
he
would
talk
over
what
was
best
to
be
done
with
their
mother
who
had
been
made
executor
with
tom
of
his
will
tom
laughed
a
little
but
looked
disturbed
his
wife
had
said
something
to
the
same
effect
and
his
mother
had
spoken
once
or
twice
in
her
letters
of
the
prospect
of
starting
the
mill
again
he
was
not
a
bit
of
a
business
man
and
he
did
not
feel
certain
with
the
theories
which
he
had
arrived
at
of
the
state
of
the
country
that
it
was
safe
yet
to
spend
the
money
which
would
have
to
be
spent
in
putting
the
mill
in
order
they
think
that
the
minute
it
is
going
again
we
shall
be
making
money
hand
over
hand
just
as
father
did
when
we
were
children
he
said
it
is
going
to
cost
us
no
end
of
money
before
we
can
make
anything
before
father
died
he
meant
to
put
in
a
good
deal
of
new
machinery
i
remember
i
do
know
anything
about
the
business
myself
and
i
would
have
sold
out
long
ago
if
i
had
had
an
offer
that
came
anywhere
near
the
value
the
larger
mills
are
the
only
ones
that
are
good
for
anything
now
and
we
should
have
to
bring
a
crowd
of
french
canadians
here
the
day
is
past
for
the
people
who
live
in
this
part
of
the
country
to
go
into
the
factory
again
even
the
irish
all
go
west
when
they
come
into
the
country
and
do
come
to
places
like
this
any
more
but
there
are
a
good
many
of
the
old
down
in
the
village
said
wilson
jack
towne
asked
me
the
other
day
if
you
going
to
start
up
in
the
spring
tom
moved
uneasily
in
his
chair
i
put
you
in
for
superintendent
if
you
like
he
said
half
angrily
whereupon
mary
threw
the
newspaper
at
him
but
by
the
time
he
had
thrown
it
back
he
was
in
good
humor
again
do
you
know
tom
she
said
with
amazing
seriousness
that
i
believe
i
should
like
nothing
in
the
world
so
much
as
to
be
the
head
of
a
large
business
i
hate
keeping
house
i
always
did
and
i
never
did
so
much
of
it
in
all
my
life
put
together
as
i
have
since
i
have
been
married
i
suppose
it
is
womanly
to
say
so
but
if
i
could
escape
from
the
whole
thing
i
believe
i
should
be
perfectly
happy
if
you
get
rich
when
the
mill
is
going
again
i
shall
beg
for
a
housekeeper
and
shirk
everything
i
give
you
fair
warning
i
do
believe
i
keep
this
house
half
so
well
as
you
did
before
i
came
here
tom
eyes
twinkled
i
am
going
to
have
that
glory
i
do
think
you
do
polly
but
you
ca
say
that
i
have
not
been
forbearing
i
certainly
have
not
told
you
more
than
twice
how
we
used
to
have
things
cooked
i
not
going
to
be
your
of
course
it
seemed
the
proper
thing
to
do
said
his
wife
meditatively
but
i
think
we
should
have
been
even
happier
than
we
have
if
i
had
been
spared
it
i
have
had
some
days
of
wretchedness
that
i
shudder
to
think
of
i
never
know
what
to
have
for
breakfast
and
i
ought
not
to
say
it
but
i
do
mind
the
sight
of
dust
i
look
upon
housekeeping
as
my
life
great
discipline
and
at
this
pathetic
confession
they
both
laughed
heartily
i
a
great
mind
to
take
it
off
your
hands
said
tom
i
always
rather
liked
it
to
tell
the
truth
and
i
ought
to
be
a
better
housekeeper
i
have
been
at
it
for
five
years
though
housekeeping
for
one
is
different
from
what
it
is
for
two
and
one
of
them
a
woman
you
see
you
have
brought
a
different
element
into
my
family
luckily
the
servants
are
pretty
well
drilled
i
do
think
you
upset
them
a
good
deal
at
first
mary
wilson
smiled
as
if
she
only
half
heard
what
he
was
saying
she
drummed
with
her
foot
on
the
floor
and
looked
intently
at
the
fire
and
presently
gave
it
a
vigorous
poking
well
said
tom
after
he
had
waited
patiently
as
long
as
he
could
tom
i
going
to
propose
something
to
you
i
wish
you
would
really
do
as
you
said
and
take
all
the
home
affairs
under
your
care
and
let
me
start
the
mill
i
am
certain
i
could
manage
it
of
course
i
should
get
people
who
understood
the
thing
to
teach
me
i
believe
i
was
made
for
it
i
should
like
it
above
all
things
and
this
is
what
i
will
do
i
will
bear
the
cost
of
starting
it
myself
i
think
i
have
money
enough
or
can
get
it
and
if
i
have
not
put
affairs
in
the
right
trim
at
the
end
of
a
year
i
will
stop
and
you
may
make
some
other
arrangement
if
i
have
you
and
your
mother
and
sister
can
pay
me
back
so
i
am
going
to
be
the
wife
and
you
the
husband
said
tom
a
little
indignantly
at
least
that
is
what
people
will
say
it
a
regular
darby
and
joan
affair
and
you
think
you
can
do
more
work
in
a
day
than
i
can
do
in
three
do
you
know
that
you
must
go
to
town
to
buy
cotton
and
do
you
know
there
are
a
thousand
things
about
it
that
you
know
and
never
will
said
mary
with
perfect
good
humor
why
tom
i
can
learn
as
well
as
you
and
a
good
deal
better
for
i
like
business
and
you
do
you
forget
that
i
was
always
father
man
after
i
was
a
dozen
years
old
and
that
you
have
let
me
invest
my
money
and
some
of
your
own
and
i
have
made
a
blunder
yet
tom
thought
that
his
wife
had
never
looked
so
handsome
or
so
happy
i
do
care
i
should
rather
like
the
fun
of
knowing
what
people
will
say
it
is
a
new
departure
at
any
rate
women
think
they
can
do
everything
better
than
men
in
these
days
but
i
the
first
man
apparently
who
has
wished
he
were
a
woman
of
course
people
will
laugh
said
mary
but
they
will
say
that
just
like
me
and
think
i
am
fortunate
to
have
married
a
man
who
will
let
me
do
as
i
choose
i
do
see
why
it
is
sensible
you
will
be
living
exactly
as
you
were
before
you
married
as
to
home
affairs
and
since
it
was
a
good
thing
for
you
to
know
something
about
housekeeping
then
i
ca
imagine
why
you
should
go
on
with
it
now
since
it
makes
me
miserable
and
i
am
wasting
a
fine
business
talent
while
i
do
it
what
do
we
care
for
people
talking
about
it
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
something
like
women
smoking
it
wicked
but
it
is
the
custom
of
the
country
and
i
do
like
the
idea
of
your
going
among
business
men
of
course
i
should
be
above
going
with
you
and
having
people
think
i
must
be
an
idiot
they
would
say
that
you
married
a
manufacturing
interest
and
i
was
thrown
in
i
can
foresee
that
my
pride
is
going
to
be
humbled
to
the
dust
in
every
way
tom
declared
in
mournful
tones
and
began
to
shake
with
laughter
it
is
one
of
your
lovely
castles
in
the
air
dear
polly
but
an
old
brick
mill
needs
a
better
foundation
than
the
clouds
no
i
look
around
and
get
an
honest
experienced
man
for
agent
i
suppose
it
the
best
thing
we
can
do
for
the
machinery
ought
not
to
lie
still
any
longer
but
i
mean
to
sell
the
factory
as
soon
as
i
can
i
devoutly
wish
it
would
take
fire
for
the
insurance
would
be
the
best
price
we
are
likely
to
get
that
is
a
famous
letter
from
alice
i
am
afraid
the
captain
has
been
growling
over
his
pay
or
they
have
been
giving
too
many
little
dinners
on
board
ship
if
we
were
rid
of
the
mill
you
and
i
might
go
out
there
this
winter
it
would
be
capital
fun
mary
smiled
again
in
an
way
tom
had
an
uneasy
feeling
that
he
had
not
heard
the
end
of
it
yet
but
nothing
more
was
said
for
a
day
or
two
when
tom
wilson
announced
with
no
apparent
thought
of
being
contradicted
that
she
had
entirely
made
up
her
mind
and
she
meant
to
see
those
men
who
had
been
overseers
of
the
different
departments
who
still
lived
in
the
village
and
have
the
mill
put
in
order
at
once
tom
looked
disturbed
but
made
no
opposition
and
soon
after
breakfast
his
wife
formally
presented
him
with
a
handful
of
keys
and
told
him
there
was
some
lamb
in
the
house
for
dinner
and
presently
he
heard
the
wheels
of
her
little
phaeton
rattling
off
down
the
road
i
should
be
untruthful
if
i
tried
to
persuade
any
one
that
he
was
not
provoked
he
thought
she
would
at
least
have
waited
for
his
formal
permission
and
at
first
he
meant
to
take
another
horse
and
chase
her
and
bring
her
back
in
disgrace
and
put
a
stop
to
the
whole
thing
but
something
assured
him
that
she
knew
what
she
was
about
and
he
determined
to
let
her
have
her
own
way
if
she
failed
it
might
do
no
harm
and
this
was
the
only
ungallant
thought
he
gave
her
he
was
sure
that
she
would
do
nothing
unladylike
or
be
unmindful
of
his
dignity
and
he
believed
it
would
be
looked
upon
as
one
of
her
odd
independent
freaks
which
always
had
won
respect
in
the
end
however
much
they
had
been
laughed
at
in
the
beginning
susan
said
he
as
that
estimable
person
went
by
the
door
with
the
you
may
tell
catherine
to
come
to
me
for
orders
about
the
house
and
you
may
do
so
yourself
i
am
going
to
take
charge
again
as
i
did
before
i
was
married
it
is
no
trouble
to
me
and
wilson
dislikes
it
besides
she
is
going
into
business
and
will
have
a
great
deal
else
to
think
of
yes
sir
very
well
sir
said
susan
who
was
suddenly
moved
to
ask
so
many
questions
that
she
was
utterly
silent
but
her
master
looked
very
happy
there
was
evidently
no
disapproval
of
his
wife
and
she
went
on
up
the
stairs
and
began
to
sweep
them
down
knocking
the
about
excitedly
as
if
she
were
trying
to
kill
a
descending
colony
of
insects
tom
went
out
to
the
stable
and
mounted
his
horse
which
had
been
waiting
for
him
to
take
his
customary
ride
to
the
and
he
galloped
down
the
road
in
quest
of
the
phaeton
he
saw
mary
talking
with
jack
towne
who
had
been
an
overseer
and
a
valued
workman
of
his
father
he
was
looking
much
surprised
and
pleased
i
was
caring
so
much
about
getting
work
myself
he
explained
i
got
what
will
carry
me
and
my
wife
through
but
it
be
better
for
the
young
folks
about
here
to
work
near
home
my
nephews
are
wanting
something
to
do
they
were
going
to
lynn
next
week
i
do
say
but
i
should
like
to
be
to
work
in
the
old
place
again
i
sort
of
missed
it
since
we
shut
down
i
sorry
i
was
so
long
in
overtaking
you
said
tom
politely
to
his
wife
well
jack
did
wilson
tell
you
she
going
to
start
the
mill
you
must
give
her
all
the
help
you
can
i
will
said
towne
gallantly
without
a
bit
of
astonishment
i
do
know
much
about
the
business
yet
said
wilson
who
had
been
a
little
overcome
at
jack
towne
lingo
of
the
different
rooms
and
machinery
and
who
felt
an
overpowering
sense
of
having
a
great
deal
before
her
in
the
next
few
weeks
by
the
time
the
mill
is
ready
i
will
be
ready
too
she
said
taking
heart
a
little
and
tom
who
was
quick
to
understand
her
moods
could
not
help
laughing
as
he
rode
alongside
we
want
a
new
barrel
of
flour
tom
dear
she
said
by
way
of
punishment
for
his
untimely
mirth
if
she
lost
courage
in
the
long
delay
or
was
disheartened
at
the
steady
call
for
funds
she
made
no
sign
and
after
a
while
the
mill
started
up
and
her
cares
were
lightened
so
that
she
told
tom
that
before
next
pay
day
she
would
like
to
go
to
boston
for
a
few
days
and
go
to
the
theatre
and
have
a
frolic
and
a
rest
she
really
looked
pale
and
thin
and
she
said
she
never
worked
so
hard
in
all
her
life
but
nobody
knew
how
happy
she
was
and
she
was
so
glad
she
had
married
tom
for
some
men
would
have
laughed
at
it
i
laughed
at
it
said
tom
meekly
all
is
if
i
do
cry
by
and
by
because
i
am
a
beggar
i
shall
be
lucky
but
mary
looked
fearlessly
serene
and
said
that
there
was
no
danger
at
present
it
would
have
been
ridiculous
to
expect
a
dividend
the
first
year
though
the
nagasaki
people
were
pacified
with
difficulty
all
the
business
letters
came
to
tom
address
and
everybody
who
was
not
directly
concerned
thought
that
he
was
the
motive
power
of
the
reawakened
enterprise
sometimes
business
people
came
to
the
mill
and
were
amazed
at
having
to
confer
with
wilson
but
they
soon
had
to
respect
her
talents
and
her
success
she
was
helped
by
the
old
clerk
who
had
been
promptly
recalled
and
reinstated
and
she
certainly
did
capitally
well
she
was
laughed
at
as
she
had
expected
to
be
and
people
said
they
should
think
tom
would
be
ashamed
of
himself
but
it
soon
appeared
that
he
was
not
to
blame
and
what
reproach
was
offered
was
on
the
score
of
his
wife
oddity
there
was
nothing
about
the
mill
that
she
did
not
understand
before
very
long
and
at
the
end
of
the
second
year
she
declared
a
small
dividend
with
great
pride
and
triumph
and
she
was
congratulated
on
her
success
and
every
one
thought
of
her
project
in
a
different
way
from
the
way
they
had
thought
of
it
in
the
beginning
she
had
singularly
good
fortune
at
the
end
of
the
third
year
she
was
making
money
for
herself
and
her
friends
faster
than
most
people
were
and
approving
letters
began
to
come
from
nagasaki
the
ashtons
had
been
ordered
to
stay
in
that
region
and
it
was
evident
that
they
were
continually
being
obliged
to
entertain
more
instead
of
less
their
children
were
growing
fast
too
and
constantly
becoming
more
expensive
the
captain
and
his
wife
had
already
begun
to
congratulate
themselves
secretly
that
their
two
sons
would
in
all
probability
come
into
possession
one
day
of
their
uncle
tom
handsome
property
for
a
good
while
tom
enjoyed
life
and
went
on
his
quiet
way
serenely
he
was
anxious
at
first
for
he
thought
that
mary
was
going
to
make
ducks
and
drakes
of
his
money
and
her
own
and
then
he
did
not
exactly
like
the
looks
of
the
thing
either
he
feared
that
his
wife
was
growing
successful
as
a
business
person
at
the
risk
of
losing
her
womanliness
but
as
time
went
on
and
he
found
there
was
no
fear
of
that
he
accepted
the
situation
philosophically
he
gave
up
his
collection
of
engravings
having
become
more
interested
in
one
of
coins
and
medals
which
took
up
most
of
his
leisure
time
he
often
went
to
the
city
in
pursuit
of
such
treasures
and
gained
much
renown
in
certain
quarters
as
a
numismatologist
of
great
skill
and
experience
but
at
last
his
house
which
had
almost
kept
itself
and
had
given
him
little
to
do
beside
ordering
the
dinners
while
faithful
old
catherine
and
her
niece
susan
were
his
aids
suddenly
became
a
great
care
to
him
catherine
who
had
been
the
of
the
family
for
many
years
died
after
a
short
illness
and
susan
must
needs
choose
that
time
of
all
others
for
being
married
to
one
of
the
second
hands
in
the
mill
there
followed
a
long
and
dismal
season
of
experimenting
and
for
a
time
there
was
a
procession
of
incapable
creatures
going
in
at
one
kitchen
door
and
out
of
the
other
his
wife
would
not
have
liked
to
say
so
but
it
seemed
to
her
that
tom
was
growing
fussy
about
the
house
affairs
and
took
more
notice
of
those
minor
details
than
he
used
she
wished
more
than
once
when
she
was
tired
that
he
would
not
talk
so
much
about
the
housekeeping
he
seemed
sometimes
to
have
no
other
thought
in
the
early
days
of
wilson
business
life
she
had
made
it
a
rule
to
consult
her
husband
on
every
subject
of
importance
but
it
had
speedily
proved
to
be
a
formality
tom
tried
manfully
to
show
a
deep
interest
which
he
did
not
feel
and
his
wife
gave
up
little
by
little
telling
him
much
about
her
affairs
she
said
that
she
liked
to
drop
business
when
she
came
home
in
the
evening
and
at
last
she
fell
into
the
habit
of
taking
a
nap
on
the
library
sofa
while
tom
who
could
not
use
his
eyes
much
by
sat
smoking
or
in
utter
idleness
before
the
fire
when
they
were
first
married
his
wife
had
made
it
a
rule
that
she
should
always
read
him
the
evening
papers
and
afterward
they
had
always
gone
on
with
some
book
of
history
or
philosophy
in
which
they
were
both
interested
these
evenings
of
their
early
married
life
had
been
charming
to
both
of
them
and
from
time
to
time
one
would
say
to
the
other
that
they
ought
to
take
up
again
the
habit
of
reading
together
mary
was
so
unaffectedly
tired
in
the
evening
that
tom
never
liked
to
propose
a
walk
for
though
he
was
not
a
man
of
peculiarly
social
nature
he
had
always
been
accustomed
to
pay
an
occasional
evening
visit
to
his
neighbors
in
the
village
and
though
he
had
little
interest
in
the
business
world
and
still
less
knowledge
of
it
after
a
while
he
wished
that
his
wife
would
have
more
to
say
about
what
she
was
planning
and
doing
or
how
things
were
getting
on
he
thought
that
her
chief
aid
old
jackson
was
far
more
in
her
thoughts
than
he
she
was
forever
quoting
jackson
opinions
he
did
not
like
to
find
that
she
took
it
for
granted
that
he
was
not
interested
in
the
welfare
of
his
own
property
it
made
him
feel
like
a
sort
of
pensioner
and
dependent
though
when
they
had
guests
at
the
house
which
was
by
no
means
seldom
there
was
nothing
in
her
manner
that
would
imply
that
she
thought
herself
in
any
way
the
head
of
the
family
it
was
hard
work
to
find
fault
with
his
wife
in
any
way
though
to
give
him
his
due
he
rarely
tried
but
this
being
a
wholly
unnatural
state
of
things
the
reader
must
expect
to
hear
of
its
change
at
last
and
the
first
blow
from
the
enemy
was
dealt
by
an
old
woman
who
lived
near
by
and
who
called
to
tom
one
morning
as
he
was
driving
down
to
the
village
in
a
great
hurry
to
post
a
letter
which
ordered
his
agent
to
secure
a
ancient
copper
coin
at
any
price
to
ask
him
if
they
had
made
yeast
that
week
and
if
she
could
borrow
a
cupful
as
her
own
had
met
with
some
misfortune
tom
was
instantly
in
a
rage
and
he
mentally
condemned
her
to
some
undeserved
fate
but
told
her
aloud
to
go
and
see
the
cook
this
slight
delay
besides
being
killing
to
his
dignity
caused
him
to
lose
the
mail
and
in
the
end
his
copper
coin
it
was
a
hard
day
for
him
altogether
it
was
wednesday
and
the
first
days
of
the
week
having
been
stormy
the
washing
was
very
late
and
mary
came
home
to
dinner
provokingly
she
had
met
an
old
and
her
husband
driving
home
from
the
mountains
and
had
first
taken
them
over
her
factory
to
their
great
amusement
and
delight
and
then
had
brought
them
home
to
dinner
tom
greeted
them
cordially
and
manifested
his
usual
graceful
hospitality
but
the
minute
he
saw
his
wife
alone
he
said
in
a
plaintive
tone
of
rebuke
i
should
think
you
might
have
remembered
that
the
servants
are
unusually
busy
i
do
wish
you
would
take
a
little
interest
in
things
at
home
the
women
have
been
washing
and
sure
i
do
know
what
sort
of
a
dinner
we
can
give
your
friends
i
wish
you
had
thought
to
bring
home
some
steak
i
have
been
busy
myself
and
could
go
down
to
the
village
i
thought
we
would
only
have
a
lunch
mary
was
hungry
but
she
said
nothing
except
that
it
would
be
all
right
she
did
mind
and
perhaps
they
could
have
some
canned
soup
she
often
went
to
town
to
buy
or
look
at
cotton
or
to
see
some
improvement
in
machinery
and
she
brought
home
beautiful
bits
of
furniture
and
new
pictures
for
the
house
and
showed
a
touching
thoughtfulness
in
remembering
tom
fancies
but
somehow
he
had
an
uneasy
suspicion
that
she
could
get
along
pretty
well
without
him
when
it
came
to
the
deeper
wishes
and
hopes
of
her
life
and
that
her
most
important
concerns
were
all
matters
in
which
he
had
no
share
he
seemed
to
himself
to
have
merged
his
life
in
his
wife
he
lost
his
interest
in
things
outside
the
house
and
grounds
he
felt
himself
fast
growing
rusty
and
behind
the
times
and
to
have
somehow
missed
a
good
deal
in
life
he
had
a
suspicion
that
he
was
a
failure
one
day
the
thought
rushed
over
him
that
his
had
been
almost
exactly
the
experience
of
most
women
and
he
wondered
if
it
really
was
any
more
disappointing
and
ignominious
to
him
than
it
was
to
women
themselves
some
of
them
may
be
contented
with
it
he
said
to
himself
soberly
people
think
women
are
designed
for
such
careers
by
nature
but
i
do
know
why
i
ever
made
such
a
fool
of
myself
having
once
seen
his
situation
in
life
from
such
a
standpoint
he
felt
it
day
by
day
to
be
more
degrading
and
he
wondered
what
he
should
do
about
it
and
once
drawn
by
a
new
strange
sympathy
he
went
to
the
little
family
burying
ground
it
was
one
of
the
mild
dim
days
that
come
sometimes
in
early
november
when
the
pale
sunlight
is
like
the
pathetic
smile
of
a
sad
face
and
he
sat
for
a
long
time
on
the
limp
grass
beside
his
mother
grave
but
when
he
went
home
in
the
twilight
his
who
just
then
was
making
them
a
little
visit
mentioned
that
she
had
been
looking
through
some
boxes
of
hers
that
had
been
packed
long
before
and
stowed
away
in
the
garret
everything
looks
very
nice
up
there
she
said
in
her
wheezing
voice
which
worse
than
usual
that
day
always
made
him
nervous
and
added
without
any
intentional
slight
to
his
feelings
i
do
think
you
have
always
been
a
most
excellent
housekeeper
i
tired
of
such
nonsense
he
exclaimed
with
surprising
indignation
mary
i
wish
you
to
arrange
your
affairs
so
that
you
can
leave
them
for
six
months
at
least
i
am
going
to
spend
this
winter
in
europe
why
tom
dear
said
his
wife
appealingly
i
could
leave
my
business
any
way
in
the
but
she
caught
sight
of
a
look
on
his
usually
placid
countenance
that
was
something
more
than
decision
and
refrained
from
saying
anything
more
and
three
weeks
from
that
day
they
sailed
debby
there
is
a
class
of
elderly
new
england
women
which
is
fast
dying
out
those
good
souls
who
have
sprung
from
a
soil
full
of
the
true
new
england
instincts
who
were
used
to
the
ways
and
whose
minds
were
stored
with
quaint
country
lore
and
tradition
the
fashions
of
the
newer
generations
do
not
reach
them
they
are
quite
unconscious
of
the
western
spirit
and
enterprise
and
belong
to
the
old
days
and
to
a
order
of
things
but
a
shrewder
person
does
not
exist
than
the
spokeswoman
of
the
following
reminiscences
whose
simple
history
can
be
quickly
told
since
she
spent
her
early
life
on
a
lonely
farm
leaving
it
only
once
for
any
length
of
time
one
winter
when
she
learned
her
trade
of
tailoress
she
afterward
sewed
for
her
neighbors
and
enjoyed
a
famous
reputation
for
her
skill
but
year
by
year
as
she
grew
older
there
was
less
to
do
and
at
last
to
use
her
own
expression
everybody
got
into
the
way
of
buying
cheap
clothes
just
to
save
a
little
trouble
and
she
found
herself
out
of
business
or
nearly
so
after
her
death
and
that
of
her
favorite
younger
brother
jonas
she
left
the
farm
and
came
to
a
little
house
in
the
village
where
she
lived
most
comfortably
the
rest
of
her
life
having
a
small
property
which
she
used
most
sensibly
she
was
always
ready
to
render
any
special
service
with
her
needle
and
was
a
most
welcome
guest
in
any
household
and
a
most
efficient
helper
to
be
in
the
same
room
with
her
for
a
while
was
sure
to
be
profitable
and
as
she
grew
older
she
was
delighted
to
recall
the
people
and
events
of
her
earlier
life
always
filling
her
descriptions
with
wise
reflections
and
much
quaint
humor
she
always
insisted
not
without
truth
that
the
railroads
were
making
everybody
look
and
act
of
a
piece
and
that
the
young
folks
were
more
alike
than
people
of
her
own
day
it
is
impossible
to
give
the
delightfulness
of
her
talk
in
any
written
words
as
well
as
many
of
its
peculiarities
for
her
way
of
going
round
robin
hood
barn
between
the
beginning
of
her
story
and
its
end
can
hardly
be
followed
at
all
and
certainly
not
in
her
own
dear
loitering
footsteps
on
an
idle
day
her
most
devoted
listener
thought
there
was
nothing
better
worth
doing
than
to
watch
this
good
soul
at
work
a
book
was
held
open
for
the
looks
of
the
thing
but
presently
it
was
allowed
to
flutter
its
leaves
and
close
for
miss
debby
began
without
any
apparent
provocation
they
may
say
whatever
they
have
a
mind
to
but
they
ca
persuade
me
that
there
no
such
thing
as
special
providences
and
she
twitched
her
strong
linen
thread
so
angrily
through
the
carpet
she
was
sewing
that
it
snapped
and
the
big
needle
flew
into
the
air
it
had
to
be
found
before
any
further
remarks
could
be
made
and
the
listener
also
knelt
down
to
search
for
it
after
a
while
it
was
discovered
clinging
to
miss
debby
own
dress
and
after
reharnessing
it
she
went
to
work
again
at
her
long
seam
it
was
always
significant
of
a
succession
of
miss
opinions
when
she
quoted
and
berated
certain
imaginary
persons
whom
she
designated
as
they
who
stood
for
the
opposite
side
of
the
question
and
who
merited
usually
her
deepest
scorn
and
fullest
antagonism
her
remarks
to
these
offending
parties
were
always
prefaced
with
i
tell
and
to
the
listener
mind
they
always
stood
rebuked
but
not
convinced
in
spiritual
form
it
may
be
but
most
intense
reality
a
little
group
as
solemn
as
miss
debby
herself
once
the
listener
ventured
to
ask
who
they
were
in
her
early
childhood
but
she
was
only
answered
by
a
frown
miss
debby
knew
as
well
as
any
one
the
difference
between
figurative
language
and
a
lie
sometimes
they
said
what
was
right
and
proper
and
were
treated
accordingly
but
very
seldom
and
on
this
occasion
it
seemed
that
they
had
ventured
to
trifle
with
sacred
things
i
suppose
you
too
young
to
remember
john
ashby
grandmother
a
good
woman
she
was
and
she
had
a
dreadful
time
with
her
family
they
never
could
keep
the
peace
and
there
was
always
as
many
as
two
of
them
who
did
speak
with
each
other
it
seems
to
come
down
from
generation
to
generation
like
a
and
miss
debby
spoke
the
last
word
as
if
she
had
meant
it
partly
for
her
thread
which
had
again
knotted
and
caught
and
she
snatched
the
offered
scissors
without
a
word
but
said
peaceably
after
a
minute
or
two
that
the
thread
was
what
it
used
to
be
the
next
needleful
proved
more
successful
and
the
listener
asked
if
the
ashbys
were
getting
on
comfortably
at
present
they
always
behave
as
if
they
thought
they
needed
nothing
was
the
response
not
that
i
mean
that
they
are
any
ways
contented
but
they
never
will
give
in
that
other
folks
holds
a
candle
to
there
one
kind
of
pride
that
i
do
hate
when
folks
is
satisfied
with
their
selves
and
do
see
no
need
of
improvement
i
believe
in
but
i
believe
in
respecting
other
folks
rights
as
much
as
your
own
but
it
takes
an
ashby
to
ride
right
over
you
i
tell
it
the
spirit
of
the
tyrants
of
old
and
it
the
kind
of
pride
that
goes
before
a
fall
john
ashby
grandmother
was
a
clever
little
woman
as
ever
stepped
she
came
from
over
hardwick
way
and
i
think
she
kep
kind
of
as
long
as
she
was
round
but
she
got
wore
out
a
doin
of
it
an
went
down
to
her
grave
in
a
quick
consumption
my
mother
set
up
with
her
the
night
she
died
it
was
in
may
towards
the
latter
part
and
an
awful
rainy
night
it
was
the
storm
that
always
comes
in
time
i
remember
well
that
mother
come
crying
home
in
the
morning
and
told
us
mis
ashby
was
dead
she
brought
marilly
with
her
that
was
about
my
own
age
and
was
taken
away
within
six
months
afterwards
she
pined
herself
to
death
for
her
mother
and
when
she
caught
the
scarlet
fever
she
went
as
quick
as
when
it
just
ready
to
fall
and
a
wind
strikes
it
she
like
the
rest
of
she
took
after
her
mother
folks
altogether
you
know
our
farm
was
right
next
to
theirs
the
one
asa
hopper
owns
now
but
he
let
it
all
run
out
and
so
as
we
lived
some
ways
from
the
stores
we
had
to
be
neighborly
for
we
depended
on
each
other
for
a
good
many
things
families
in
lonesome
places
get
out
of
one
supply
and
another
and
have
to
borrow
until
they
get
a
chance
to
send
to
the
village
or
sometimes
in
a
busy
season
some
of
the
folks
would
have
to
leave
work
and
be
gone
half
a
day
land
you
do
know
nothing
about
old
times
and
the
life
that
used
to
go
on
about
here
you
ca
step
into
a
house
anywheres
now
that
there
ai
the
county
map
and
they
do
fetch
out
the
photograph
book
and
in
every
district
you
find
all
the
folks
has
got
the
same
chromo
picture
hung
up
and
all
sorts
of
luxuries
and
makeshifts
o
splendor
that
would
have
made
the
folks
i
was
fetched
up
by
stare
their
eyes
out
o
their
heads
it
was
all
we
could
do
to
keep
along
then
and
if
anybody
was
called
rich
it
was
only
because
he
had
a
great
sight
of
land
and
then
it
was
drudge
drudge
the
harder
to
pay
the
taxes
there
was
hardly
any
ready
money
and
i
recollect
well
that
old
tommy
simms
was
reputed
wealthy
and
it
was
told
over
fifty
times
a
year
that
he
got
a
solid
four
thousand
dollars
in
the
bank
he
strutted
round
like
a
and
thought
he
ought
to
have
his
first
say
about
everything
that
was
going
i
was
talking
about
the
ashbys
was
i
i
do
know
i
ever
told
you
about
the
fight
they
had
after
their
father
died
about
the
old
house
joseph
was
married
to
a
girl
he
met
in
time
who
had
a
little
property
two
or
three
hundred
dollars
from
an
old
great
uncle
that
she
been
keeping
house
for
and
i
do
know
what
other
plans
she
may
have
had
for
spending
of
her
means
but
she
laid
most
of
it
out
in
a
husband
for
joseph
never
cared
any
great
about
her
that
i
could
see
though
he
always
treated
her
well
enough
she
was
a
poor
ignorant
sort
of
thing
seven
years
older
than
he
was
but
she
had
a
pleasant
kind
of
a
face
and
seemed
like
an
overgrown
girl
of
six
or
eight
years
old
i
remember
just
after
they
was
married
joseph
was
taken
down
with
a
quinsy
sore
throat
being
always
subject
to
them
and
mother
was
over
in
the
forenoon
and
she
was
one
that
was
always
giving
right
hand
and
left
and
she
told
susan
ellen
that
was
his
wife
to
step
over
in
the
afternoon
and
she
would
give
her
some
blackberry
preserve
for
him
she
had
some
that
was
nice
and
it
was
very
healing
so
along
about
one
just
as
we
had
got
the
kitchen
cleared
and
mother
and
i
had
got
out
the
big
wheels
to
spin
a
few
rolls
we
always
liked
to
spin
together
and
mother
was
always
good
company
my
brother
jonas
that
was
the
youngest
of
us
looked
out
of
the
window
and
says
he
comes
joe
ashby
wife
with
a
pail
mother
she
began
to
shake
all
over
with
a
laugh
she
tried
to
swallow
down
but
i
did
know
what
it
was
all
about
and
in
come
poor
susan
ellen
and
lit
on
the
edge
of
the
first
chair
and
set
the
pail
down
beside
of
her
we
tried
to
make
her
feel
welcome
and
spoke
about
everything
we
could
contrive
seein
as
it
was
the
first
time
been
over
and
she
seemed
grateful
and
did
the
best
she
could
and
lost
her
strangeness
with
mother
right
away
for
mother
was
the
best
hand
to
make
folks
feel
to
home
with
her
that
i
ever
come
across
there
many
like
her
now
nor
never
was
i
tell
but
there
nothing
said
about
the
pail
and
there
it
set
on
the
floor
until
susan
ellen
said
she
must
be
going
and
mentioned
that
there
was
something
said
about
a
remedy
for
joseph
throat
yes
says
mother
and
she
brought
out
the
little
stone
jar
she
kept
the
preserve
in
and
there
more
than
the
half
of
it
full
susan
ellen
took
up
the
cover
off
the
pail
and
i
walked
off
into
the
bedroom
for
i
thought
i
should
laugh
certain
mother
put
in
a
big
spoonful
and
another
and
i
heard
drop
and
she
went
on
with
one
or
two
more
and
then
she
give
up
give
you
the
jar
and
welcome
she
says
i
ai
very
well
off
for
preserves
and
i
was
kind
of
counting
on
this
for
tea
in
case
my
brother
folks
are
over
susan
ellen
thanked
her
and
said
joseph
would
be
obliged
and
back
she
went
acrost
the
pasture
i
can
see
that
big
tin
pail
now
in
the
sun
the
old
man
was
alive
then
and
he
took
a
great
spite
against
poor
susan
ellen
though
he
never
would
if
he
had
been
set
on
by
john
and
whether
he
was
mad
because
joseph
had
stepped
in
to
so
much
good
money
or
what
i
do
know
but
he
twitted
him
about
her
and
at
last
he
and
the
old
man
between
was
too
much
to
bear
and
joe
fitted
up
a
couple
o
rooms
for
himself
in
a
building
he
put
up
for
a
kind
of
he
used
to
carpenter
by
spells
and
he
clapboarded
it
and
made
it
as
comfortable
as
he
could
and
he
ordered
john
out
of
it
for
good
and
all
but
he
and
susan
ellen
both
treated
the
old
sir
the
best
they
knew
how
and
joseph
kept
right
on
with
his
farm
work
same
as
ever
and
meant
to
lay
up
a
little
more
money
to
join
with
his
wife
and
push
off
as
soon
as
he
could
for
the
sake
of
peace
though
if
there
was
anybody
set
by
the
farm
it
was
joseph
he
was
to
blame
for
some
things
i
never
saw
an
ashby
that
was
and
i
dare
say
he
was
aggravating
they
were
clearing
a
piece
of
woodland
that
winter
and
the
old
man
was
laid
up
in
the
house
with
the
rheumatism
off
and
on
and
that
made
him
fractious
and
he
and
john
connived
together
till
one
day
joseph
and
susan
ellen
had
taken
the
sleigh
and
gone
to
freeport
four
corners
to
get
some
flour
and
one
thing
and
another
and
to
have
the
horse
shod
beside
so
they
was
likely
to
be
gone
two
or
three
hours
john
jacobs
was
going
by
with
his
oxen
and
john
ashby
and
the
old
man
hailed
him
and
said
give
him
a
dollar
if
he
help
and
they
hitched
the
two
yoke
his
and
to
joseph
house
there
any
foundation
to
speak
of
the
sills
set
right
on
the
ground
and
he
banked
it
up
with
a
few
old
boards
and
some
pine
spills
and
sand
and
stuff
just
to
keep
the
cold
out
there
but
a
little
snow
and
the
roads
was
smooth
and
icy
and
they
slipped
it
along
as
if
it
had
been
a
and
got
it
down
the
road
a
half
a
mile
or
so
to
the
fork
of
the
roads
and
left
it
settin
there
right
on
the
jacobs
told
afterward
that
he
kind
of
disliked
to
do
it
but
he
thought
as
long
as
their
minds
were
set
he
might
as
well
have
the
dollar
as
anybody
he
said
when
the
house
give
a
slew
on
a
sideling
piece
in
the
road
he
heard
some
of
the
smash
down
and
a
branch
of
an
oak
they
passed
by
caught
hold
of
the
that
come
out
through
one
of
the
walls
and
give
that
a
wrench
but
he
guessed
there
no
great
damage
joseph
may
have
given
some
provocation
before
he
went
away
in
the
morning
i
do
know
he
did
and
i
do
know
he
did
but
at
any
rate
when
he
was
coming
home
late
in
the
afternoon
he
caught
sight
of
his
house
some
of
our
folks
was
right
behind
and
they
saw
him
and
he
stood
right
up
in
the
sleigh
and
shook
his
fist
he
was
so
mad
but
afterwards
he
out
laughin
it
did
look
kind
of
curi
it
bigger
than
a
front
entry
and
it
set
up
so
pert
right
there
on
the
as
if
he
was
to
farm
it
the
folks
said
susan
ellen
covered
up
her
face
in
her
shawl
and
began
to
cry
i
the
pore
thing
was
discouraged
joseph
was
awful
mad
he
was
kind
of
laughing
and
cryin
together
our
folks
stopped
and
asked
him
if
there
was
anything
they
could
do
and
he
said
no
but
susan
ellen
went
in
to
view
how
things
were
and
they
made
up
a
fire
and
then
joe
took
the
horse
home
and
i
guess
they
had
it
hot
and
heavy
nobody
supposed
they
ever
make
up
there
was
a
funeral
in
the
family
to
bring
together
the
fight
had
gone
so
far
but
in
the
winter
old
ashby
the
boys
father
was
taken
down
with
a
spell
o
sickness
and
there
anybody
they
could
get
to
come
and
look
after
the
house
the
doctor
hunted
and
they
all
hunted
but
there
did
seem
to
be
anybody
so
thick
settled
as
now
and
there
was
no
spare
help
so
john
had
to
eat
humble
pie
and
go
and
ask
susan
ellen
if
she
would
come
back
and
let
be
she
was
as
a
creatur
as
ever
stepped
and
did
the
best
she
knew
and
she
spoke
up
as
pleasant
as
could
be
and
said
she
go
right
off
that
afternoon
and
help
through
the
old
ashby
had
been
a
hard
drinker
in
his
day
and
he
was
all
broke
down
nobody
ever
saw
him
that
he
could
walk
straight
but
he
got
a
crooked
disposition
out
of
it
if
nothing
else
i
there
never
was
a
man
loved
sperit
better
they
said
one
year
he
was
over
to
cyrus
barker
to
help
with
the
haying
and
there
was
a
jug
o
new
england
rum
over
by
the
spring
with
some
gingerbread
and
cheese
and
stuff
and
he
went
over
about
every
half
an
hour
to
take
something
and
along
about
ten
he
got
the
jug
middling
low
so
he
went
to
fill
it
up
with
a
little
water
and
lost
holt
of
it
and
it
sunk
and
they
said
he
drunk
the
spring
dry
three
times
joe
and
susan
ellen
stayed
there
at
the
old
place
well
into
the
summer
and
then
after
planting
they
moved
down
to
the
four
corners
where
they
had
bought
a
nice
little
place
joe
did
well
there
he
carried
on
the
carpenter
trade
and
got
smoothed
down
considerable
being
amongst
folks
john
he
married
a
pecker
girl
and
got
his
match
too
she
was
the
only
living
soul
he
ever
was
afraid
of
they
lived
on
there
a
spell
and
why
they
must
have
lived
there
all
of
fifteen
or
twenty
years
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
for
the
time
they
moved
was
after
the
railroad
was
built
was
along
in
the
winter
and
his
wife
she
got
a
notion
to
buy
a
place
down
to
the
falls
below
the
corners
after
the
mills
got
started
and
have
john
work
in
the
while
she
took
boarders
she
said
no
use
staying
on
the
farm
they
could
make
a
living
off
from
it
now
they
cut
the
growth
joe
folks
and
she
never
could
get
along
and
they
said
she
was
dreadfully
riled
up
hearing
how
much
joe
was
getting
in
the
machine
shop
they
need
tell
me
about
special
providences
being
all
moonshine
said
miss
debby
for
the
second
time
if
here
a
plain
one
never
say
one
word
more
about
it
you
see
that
very
time
joe
ashby
got
a
splinter
in
his
eye
and
they
were
afraid
he
was
going
to
lose
his
sight
and
he
got
a
notion
that
he
wanted
to
go
back
to
farming
he
always
set
everything
by
the
old
place
and
he
had
a
boy
growing
up
that
neither
took
to
his
book
nor
to
mill
work
and
he
wanted
to
farm
it
too
so
joe
got
hold
of
john
one
day
when
he
come
in
with
some
wood
and
asked
him
why
he
would
take
his
place
for
a
year
or
two
if
he
wanted
to
get
to
the
village
and
let
him
go
out
to
the
old
place
my
brother
jonas
was
standin
right
by
and
heard
and
said
he
never
heard
nobody
speak
civiller
but
john
swore
and
said
he
going
to
be
caught
in
no
such
a
trap
as
that
his
father
left
him
the
place
and
he
was
going
to
do
as
he
a
mind
to
there
trouble
about
the
property
for
old
ashby
had
given
joe
some
money
he
had
in
the
bank
joe
had
got
to
be
well
off
he
could
have
bought
most
any
farm
about
here
but
he
wanted
the
old
place
of
his
attachment
he
set
everything
by
his
mother
spite
of
her
being
dead
so
long
john
had
done
very
well
spite
of
his
being
so
sharp
but
he
let
out
the
best
of
the
farm
on
shares
and
bought
a
little
house
down
close
by
the
mills
and
then
some
idea
or
other
got
into
his
head
to
fit
that
up
to
let
and
move
it
to
one
side
of
the
lot
and
haul
down
the
old
house
from
the
farm
to
live
in
themselves
there
no
time
to
lose
else
the
snow
would
be
gone
so
he
got
a
gang
o
men
up
there
and
put
shoes
underneath
the
sills
and
then
they
assembled
all
the
oxen
they
could
call
in
and
started
mother
was
living
then
though
she
got
to
be
very
feeble
and
when
they
come
for
our
yoke
she
would
have
jonas
let
go
she
said
the
old
house
ought
to
stay
in
its
place
everybody
had
been
telling
john
ashby
that
the
road
was
too
hilly
and
besides
the
house
was
too
old
to
move
they
rack
it
all
to
pieces
dragging
it
so
fur
but
he
would
listen
to
no
reason
i
never
saw
mother
so
stirred
up
as
she
was
that
day
and
when
she
see
the
old
thing
a
moving
she
burst
right
out
crying
we
could
see
one
end
of
it
looking
over
the
slope
of
the
hill
in
the
pasture
between
it
and
our
house
there
was
two
windows
that
looked
our
way
and
i
know
ashby
used
to
hang
a
piece
o
something
white
out
o
one
of
when
she
wanted
mother
to
step
over
for
anything
they
set
a
good
deal
by
each
other
and
mis
ashby
was
a
lame
woman
i
should
ha
thought
john
would
had
haul
the
house
right
over
the
little
gardin
she
thought
so
much
of
and
broke
down
the
laylocks
and
flowering
currant
she
set
everything
by
i
remember
when
she
died
i
was
seven
or
eight
year
old
it
was
all
in
full
bloom
and
mother
she
broke
off
a
branch
and
laid
into
the
coffin
i
do
know
as
i
ever
seen
any
since
or
set
in
a
room
and
had
the
sweetness
of
it
blow
in
at
the
windows
without
remembering
that
day
was
the
first
funeral
i
ever
went
to
and
that
may
be
some
reason
well
the
old
house
started
off
and
mother
watched
it
as
long
as
she
could
see
it
she
was
sort
o
feeble
herself
then
as
i
said
and
we
went
on
with
the
work
was
a
saturday
and
we
was
baking
and
churning
and
getting
things
to
rights
generally
jonas
had
been
over
in
the
swamp
getting
out
some
wood
he
cut
earlier
in
the
winter
and
along
in
the
afternoon
he
come
in
and
said
he
i
would
want
to
ride
down
to
the
corners
so
late
and
i
said
i
did
feel
just
like
it
so
we
started
off
we
went
the
birch
ridge
road
because
he
wanted
to
see
somebody
over
that
way
and
when
we
was
going
home
by
the
straight
road
jonas
laughed
and
said
we
had
seen
anything
of
john
ashby
moving
and
he
guessed
he
got
stuck
somewhere
he
was
glad
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
we
drove
along
pretty
quick
for
we
were
some
belated
and
we
did
like
to
leave
mother
all
alone
after
it
come
dark
all
of
a
sudden
jonas
stood
up
in
the
sleigh
and
says
he
do
believe
but
the
cars
is
off
the
track
and
i
looked
and
there
did
seem
to
be
something
the
matter
with
they
had
been
running
more
than
a
couple
o
years
then
and
we
was
prepared
for
anything
jonas
he
whipped
up
the
horse
and
we
got
there
pretty
quick
and
be
bound
if
the
ashby
house
had
got
stuck
fast
right
on
the
track
and
stir
it
one
way
or
another
they
could
they
been
there
since
one
pulling
and
hauling
and
the
men
was
all
hoarse
with
yelling
and
the
cars
had
come
from
both
ways
and
met
there
one
each
side
of
the
crossing
and
the
passengers
was
walking
about
scolding
and
swearing
and
somebody
gone
and
lit
up
a
bonfire
you
never
see
such
a
sight
in
all
your
life
i
happened
to
look
up
at
the
old
house
and
there
were
them
two
top
windows
that
used
to
look
over
to
our
place
and
they
had
caught
the
shine
of
the
firelight
and
made
the
poor
old
thing
look
as
if
it
was
scared
to
death
the
men
was
banging
at
it
with
axes
and
crowbars
and
it
was
dreadful
distressing
you
pitied
it
as
if
it
was
a
live
creatur
it
come
from
such
a
quiet
place
and
always
looked
kind
of
comfortable
though
so
much
war
had
gone
on
amongst
the
ashbys
i
tell
you
it
was
a
judgment
on
john
for
they
got
it
shoved
back
after
a
while
and
then
would
touch
it
again
not
one
of
the
men
nor
let
their
oxen
the
plastering
was
all
stove
and
the
outside
walls
all
wrenched
apart
and
john
never
did
anything
more
about
it
but
let
it
set
there
all
summer
till
it
burnt
down
and
there
was
an
end
one
night
in
september
they
supposed
some
traveling
folks
slept
in
it
and
set
it
afire
or
else
some
boys
did
it
for
fun
i
was
glad
it
was
out
of
the
way
one
day
i
know
i
was
coming
by
with
mother
and
she
said
it
made
her
feel
bad
to
see
the
little
strips
of
leather
by
the
fore
door
where
mis
ashby
had
nailed
up
a
rosebush
once
there
there
ai
an
ashby
alive
now
of
the
old
stock
except
young
john
joe
son
went
off
to
sea
and
i
believe
he
was
lost
somewhere
in
the
china
seas
or
else
he
died
of
a
fever
i
seem
to
forget
he
was
called
a
smart
boy
but
he
never
could
seem
to
settle
down
to
anything
sometimes
i
wonder
folks
is
as
good
as
they
be
when
i
consider
what
comes
to
from
their
folks
before
and
how
misshaped
by
nature
them
ashbys
never
was
like
other
folks
and
yet
some
good
streak
or
other
there
was
in
every
one
of
you
expect
much
from
such
hindered
creator
it
just
like
beratin
a
black
and
white
cat
for
being
a
poor
mouser
it
ai
her
fault
that
the
mice
see
her
quicker
than
they
can
a
gray
one
if
you
get
one
of
them
masterful
dispositions
put
with
a
good
strong
will
towards
the
right
that
what
makes
the
best
of
men
but
all
them
ashbys
cared
about
was
to
grasp
and
get
and
be
they
liked
to
see
other
folks
put
down
just
as
if
it
was
going
to
set
them
up
and
they
did
know
nothing
they
make
me
think
of
some
o
them
old
marauders
that
used
to
hive
up
into
their
castles
in
old
times
and
then
go
out
and
plundering
and
i
tell
you
that
same
sperit
was
in
they
was
born
a
couple
o
hundred
years
too
late
kind
of
folks
as
it
were
and
miss
debby
indulged
in
a
quiet
chuckle
as
she
bent
over
her
work
john
he
got
captured
by
his
wife
she
carried
too
many
guns
for
him
i
believe
he
died
very
poor
and
her
own
son
would
support
her
so
she
died
over
in
freeport
and
joe
got
along
better
his
wife
was
clever
but
rather
slack
and
it
took
her
a
good
while
to
see
through
things
she
married
again
pretty
quick
after
he
died
she
had
as
much
as
seven
or
eight
thousand
dollars
and
she
was
taken
just
as
she
stood
by
a
roving
preacher
that
was
holding
meetings
here
in
the
winter
time
he
sold
out
her
place
here
and
they
went
up
country
somewheres
that
he
come
from
her
boy
was
lost
before
that
so
there
was
nothing
to
hinder
her
there
do
you
think
i
always
when
i
get
hold
of
the
real
thing
in
folks
i
stick
to
but
there
an
awful
sight
of
poor
material
walking
about
that
ai
worth
the
ground
it
steps
on
but
when
i
look
back
a
little
ways
i
ca
blame
some
of
though
it
does
often
seem
as
if
people
might
do
better
if
they
only
set
to
work
and
tried
i
must
say
i
always
do
feel
pleased
when
i
think
how
mad
john
was
this
john
father
when
he
could
do
just
as
he
a
mind
to
with
the
pore
old
house
i
could
help
thinking
of
joe
mansion
that
he
and
his
father
hauled
down
to
the
heater
piece
in
the
fork
of
the
roads
sometimes
i
wonder
where
them
ashbys
all
went
to
they
mistake
one
place
for
the
other
in
the
next
world
for
make
heaven
out
o
hell
because
they
could
be
disagreeing
with
somebody
and
well
i
do
know
i
sure
they
kep
a
good
row
going
while
they
was
in
this
world
only
with
mother
somehow
she
could
get
along
with
anybody
and
not
always
give
their
way
either
