sentimental
education
chapter
i
a
promising
pupil
on
the
of
september
about
six
in
the
morning
the
de
just
on
the
point
of
starting
was
sending
forth
great
whirlwinds
of
smoke
in
front
of
the
quai
bernard
people
came
rushing
on
board
in
breathless
haste
the
traffic
was
obstructed
by
casks
cables
and
baskets
of
linen
the
sailors
answered
nobody
people
jostled
one
another
between
the
two
was
piled
up
a
heap
of
parcels
and
the
uproar
was
drowned
in
the
loud
hissing
of
the
steam
which
making
its
way
through
the
plates
of
enveloped
everything
in
a
white
cloud
while
the
bell
at
the
prow
kept
ringing
continuously
at
last
the
vessel
set
out
and
the
two
banks
of
the
river
stocked
with
warehouses
and
manufactories
opened
out
like
two
huge
ribbons
being
unrolled
a
young
man
of
eighteen
with
long
hair
holding
an
album
under
his
arm
remained
near
the
helm
without
moving
through
the
haze
he
surveyed
steeples
buildings
of
which
he
did
not
know
the
names
then
with
a
parting
glance
he
took
in
the
île
louis
the
cité
nôtre
dame
and
presently
as
paris
disappeared
from
his
view
he
heaved
a
deep
sigh
frederick
moreau
having
just
taken
his
bachelor
degree
was
returning
home
to
where
he
would
have
to
lead
a
languishing
existence
for
two
months
before
going
back
to
begin
his
legal
studies
his
mother
had
sent
him
with
enough
to
cover
his
expenses
to
havre
to
see
an
uncle
from
whom
she
had
expectations
of
his
receiving
an
inheritance
he
had
returned
from
that
place
only
yesterday
and
he
indemnified
himself
for
not
having
the
opportunity
of
spending
a
little
time
in
the
capital
by
taking
the
longest
possible
route
to
reach
his
own
part
of
the
country
the
hubbub
had
subsided
the
passengers
had
all
taken
their
places
some
of
them
stood
warming
themselves
around
the
machinery
and
the
chimney
spat
forth
with
a
slow
rhythmic
rattle
its
plume
of
black
smoke
little
drops
of
dew
trickled
over
the
copper
plates
the
deck
quivered
with
the
vibration
from
within
and
the
two
rapidly
turning
round
lashed
the
water
the
edges
of
the
river
were
covered
with
sand
the
vessel
swept
past
rafts
of
wood
which
began
to
oscillate
under
the
rippling
of
the
waves
or
a
boat
without
sails
in
which
a
man
sat
fishing
then
the
wandering
haze
cleared
off
the
sun
appeared
the
hill
which
ran
along
the
course
of
the
seine
to
the
right
subsided
by
degrees
and
another
rose
nearer
on
the
opposite
bank
it
was
crowned
with
trees
which
surrounded
houses
covered
with
roofs
in
the
italian
style
they
had
sloping
gardens
divided
by
fresh
walls
iron
railings
and
vases
of
geraniums
laid
out
regularly
on
the
terraces
where
one
could
lean
forward
on
one
elbow
more
than
one
spectator
longed
on
beholding
those
attractive
residences
which
looked
so
peaceful
to
be
the
owner
of
one
of
them
and
to
dwell
there
till
the
end
of
his
days
with
a
good
a
and
a
woman
or
some
other
object
to
dream
about
the
agreeable
novelty
of
a
journey
by
water
made
such
outbursts
natural
already
the
wags
on
board
were
beginning
their
jokes
many
began
to
sing
gaiety
prevailed
and
glasses
of
brandy
were
poured
out
frederick
was
thinking
about
the
apartment
which
he
would
occupy
over
there
on
the
plan
of
a
drama
on
subjects
for
pictures
on
future
passions
he
found
that
the
happiness
merited
by
the
excellence
of
his
soul
was
slow
in
arriving
he
declaimed
some
melancholy
verses
he
walked
with
rapid
step
along
the
deck
he
went
on
till
he
reached
the
end
at
which
the
bell
was
and
in
the
centre
of
a
group
of
passengers
and
sailors
he
saw
a
gentleman
talking
soft
nothings
to
a
while
fingering
the
gold
cross
which
she
wore
over
her
breast
he
was
a
jovial
blade
of
forty
with
frizzled
hair
his
robust
form
was
encased
in
a
jacket
of
black
velvet
two
emeralds
sparkled
in
his
cambric
shirt
and
his
wide
white
trousers
fell
over
red
boots
of
russian
leather
set
off
with
blue
designs
the
presence
of
frederick
did
not
discompose
him
he
turned
round
and
glanced
several
times
at
the
young
man
with
winks
of
enquiry
he
next
offered
cigars
to
all
who
were
standing
around
him
but
getting
tired
no
doubt
of
their
society
he
moved
away
from
them
and
took
a
seat
further
up
frederick
followed
him
the
conversation
at
first
turned
on
the
various
kinds
of
tobacco
then
quite
naturally
it
glided
into
a
discussion
about
women
the
gentleman
in
the
red
boots
gave
the
young
man
advice
he
put
forward
theories
related
anecdotes
referred
to
himself
by
way
of
illustration
and
he
gave
utterance
to
all
these
things
in
a
paternal
tone
with
the
ingenuousness
of
entertaining
depravity
he
was
republican
in
his
opinions
he
had
travelled
he
was
familiar
with
the
inner
life
of
theatres
restaurants
and
newspapers
and
knew
all
the
theatrical
celebrities
whom
he
called
by
their
christian
names
frederick
told
him
confidentially
about
his
projects
and
the
elder
man
took
an
encouraging
view
of
them
but
he
stopped
talking
to
take
a
look
at
the
funnel
then
he
went
mumbling
rapidly
through
a
long
calculation
in
order
to
ascertain
how
much
each
stroke
of
the
piston
at
so
many
times
per
minute
would
come
to
and
having
found
the
number
he
spoke
about
the
scenery
which
he
admired
immensely
then
he
gave
expression
to
his
delight
at
having
got
away
from
business
frederick
regarded
him
with
a
certain
amount
of
respect
and
politely
manifested
a
strong
desire
to
know
his
name
the
stranger
without
a
moment
hesitation
replied
jacques
arnoux
proprietor
of
boulevard
montmartre
a
in
a
cap
came
up
and
said
would
monsieur
have
the
kindness
to
go
below
mademoiselle
is
crying
was
a
hybrid
establishment
wherein
the
functions
of
an
and
a
were
combined
frederick
had
seen
this
title
several
times
in
the
bookseller
window
in
his
native
place
on
big
prospectuses
on
which
the
name
of
jacques
arnoux
displayed
itself
magisterially
the
sun
rays
fell
perpendicularly
shedding
a
glittering
light
on
the
iron
hoops
around
the
masts
the
plates
of
the
barricades
and
the
surface
of
the
water
which
at
the
prow
was
cut
into
two
furrows
that
spread
out
as
far
as
the
borders
of
the
meadows
at
each
winding
of
the
river
a
screen
of
pale
poplars
presented
itself
with
the
utmost
uniformity
the
surrounding
country
at
this
point
had
an
empty
look
in
the
sky
there
were
little
white
clouds
which
remained
motionless
and
the
sense
of
weariness
which
vaguely
diffused
itself
over
everything
seemed
to
retard
the
progress
of
the
steamboat
and
to
add
to
the
insignificant
appearance
of
the
passengers
putting
aside
a
few
persons
of
good
position
who
were
travelling
first
class
they
were
artisans
or
shopmen
with
their
wives
and
children
as
it
was
customary
at
that
time
to
wear
old
clothes
when
travelling
they
nearly
all
had
their
heads
covered
with
shabby
greek
caps
or
discoloured
hats
thin
black
coats
that
had
become
quite
threadbare
from
constant
rubbing
against
or
with
the
casings
of
their
buttons
loose
from
continual
service
in
the
shop
here
and
there
some
waistcoat
afforded
a
glimpse
of
a
calico
shirt
stained
with
coffee
pinchbeck
pins
were
stuck
into
cravats
that
were
all
torn
list
shoes
were
kept
up
by
stitched
straps
two
or
three
roughs
who
held
in
their
hands
bamboo
canes
with
leathern
loops
kept
looking
askance
at
their
and
fathers
of
families
opened
their
eyes
wide
while
making
enquiries
people
chatted
either
standing
up
or
squatting
over
their
luggage
some
went
to
sleep
in
various
corners
of
the
vessel
several
occupied
themselves
with
eating
the
deck
was
soiled
with
walnut
shells
of
cigars
peelings
of
pears
and
the
droppings
of
meat
which
had
been
carried
wrapped
up
in
paper
three
in
blouses
took
their
stand
in
front
of
the
bottle
case
a
in
rags
was
resting
with
his
elbows
on
his
instrument
at
intervals
could
be
heard
the
sound
of
falling
coals
in
the
furnace
a
shout
or
a
laugh
and
the
captain
kept
walking
on
the
bridge
from
one
to
the
other
without
stopping
for
a
moment
frederick
to
get
back
to
his
place
pushed
forward
the
grating
leading
into
the
part
of
the
vessel
reserved
for
passengers
and
in
so
doing
disturbed
two
sportsmen
with
their
dogs
what
he
then
saw
was
like
an
apparition
she
was
seated
in
the
middle
of
a
bench
all
alone
or
at
any
rate
he
could
see
no
one
dazzled
as
he
was
by
her
eyes
at
the
moment
when
he
was
passing
she
raised
her
head
his
shoulders
bent
involuntarily
and
when
he
had
seated
himself
some
distance
away
on
the
same
side
he
glanced
towards
her
she
wore
a
wide
straw
hat
with
red
ribbons
which
fluttered
in
the
wind
behind
her
her
black
tresses
twining
around
the
edges
of
her
large
brows
descended
very
low
and
seemed
amorously
to
press
the
oval
of
her
face
her
robe
of
light
muslin
spotted
with
green
spread
out
in
numerous
folds
she
was
in
the
act
of
embroidering
something
and
her
straight
nose
her
chin
her
entire
person
was
cut
out
on
the
background
of
the
luminous
air
and
the
blue
sky
as
she
remained
in
the
same
attitude
he
took
several
turns
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
to
hide
from
her
his
change
of
position
then
he
placed
himself
close
to
her
parasol
which
lay
against
the
bench
and
pretended
to
be
looking
at
a
sloop
on
the
river
never
before
had
he
seen
more
lustrous
dark
skin
a
more
seductive
figure
or
more
delicately
shaped
fingers
than
those
through
which
the
sunlight
gleamed
he
stared
with
amazement
at
her
as
if
it
were
something
extraordinary
what
was
her
name
her
place
of
residence
her
life
her
past
he
longed
to
become
familiar
with
the
furniture
of
her
apartment
all
the
dresses
that
she
had
worn
the
people
whom
she
visited
and
the
desire
of
physical
possession
yielded
to
a
deeper
yearning
a
painful
curiosity
that
knew
no
bounds
a
negress
wearing
a
silk
handkerchief
tied
round
her
head
made
her
appearance
holding
by
the
hand
a
little
girl
already
tall
for
her
age
the
child
whose
eyes
were
swimming
with
tears
had
just
awakened
the
lady
took
the
little
one
on
her
knees
mademoiselle
was
not
good
though
she
would
soon
be
seven
her
mother
would
not
love
her
any
more
she
was
too
often
pardoned
for
being
naughty
and
frederick
heard
those
things
with
delight
as
if
he
had
made
a
discovery
an
acquisition
he
assumed
that
she
must
be
of
andalusian
descent
perhaps
a
creole
had
she
brought
this
negress
across
with
her
from
the
west
indian
islands
meanwhile
his
attention
was
directed
to
a
long
shawl
with
violet
stripes
thrown
behind
her
back
over
the
copper
support
of
the
bench
she
must
have
many
a
time
wrapped
it
around
her
waist
as
the
vessel
sped
through
the
midst
of
the
waves
drawn
it
over
her
feet
gone
to
sleep
in
it
frederick
suddenly
noticed
that
with
the
sweep
of
its
fringes
it
was
slipping
off
and
it
was
on
the
point
of
falling
into
the
water
when
with
a
bound
he
secured
it
she
said
to
him
thanks
monsieur
their
eyes
met
are
you
ready
my
dear
cried
my
lord
arnoux
presenting
himself
at
the
hood
of
the
mademoiselle
marthe
ran
over
to
him
and
clinging
to
his
neck
she
began
pulling
at
his
moustache
the
strains
of
a
harp
were
heard
she
wanted
to
see
the
music
played
and
presently
the
performer
on
the
instrument
led
forward
by
the
negress
entered
the
place
reserved
for
saloon
passengers
arnoux
recognized
in
him
a
man
who
had
formerly
been
a
model
and
thou
him
to
the
astonishment
of
the
bystanders
at
length
the
harpist
flinging
back
his
long
hair
over
his
shoulders
stretched
out
his
hands
and
began
playing
it
was
an
oriental
ballad
all
about
poniards
flowers
and
stars
the
man
in
rags
sang
it
in
a
sharp
voice
the
twanging
of
the
harp
strings
broke
the
harmony
of
the
tune
with
false
notes
he
played
more
vigorously
the
chords
vibrated
and
their
metallic
sounds
seemed
to
send
forth
sobs
and
as
it
were
the
plaint
of
a
proud
and
vanquished
love
on
both
sides
of
the
river
woods
extended
as
far
as
the
edge
of
the
water
a
current
of
fresh
air
swept
past
them
and
madame
arnoux
gazed
vaguely
into
the
distance
when
the
music
stopped
she
moved
her
eyes
several
times
as
if
she
were
starting
out
of
a
dream
the
harpist
approached
them
with
an
air
of
humility
while
arnoux
was
searching
his
pockets
for
money
frederick
stretched
out
towards
the
cap
his
closed
hand
and
then
opening
it
in
a
shamefaced
manner
he
deposited
in
it
a
louis
it
was
not
vanity
that
had
prompted
him
to
bestow
this
alms
in
her
presence
but
the
idea
of
a
blessing
in
which
he
thought
she
might
share
an
almost
religious
impulse
of
the
heart
arnoux
pointing
out
the
way
cordially
invited
him
to
go
below
frederick
declared
that
he
had
just
lunched
on
the
contrary
he
was
nearly
dying
of
hunger
and
he
had
not
a
single
centime
in
his
purse
after
that
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
had
a
perfect
right
as
well
as
anyone
else
to
remain
in
the
cabin
ladies
and
gentlemen
were
seated
before
round
tables
lunching
while
an
attendant
went
about
serving
out
coffee
monsieur
and
madame
arnoux
were
in
the
far
corner
to
the
right
he
took
a
seat
on
the
long
bench
covered
with
velvet
having
picked
up
a
newspaper
which
he
found
there
they
would
have
to
take
the
diligence
at
montereau
for
châlons
their
tour
in
switzerland
would
last
a
month
madame
arnoux
blamed
her
husband
for
his
weakness
in
dealing
with
his
child
he
whispered
in
her
ear
something
agreeable
no
doubt
for
she
smiled
then
he
got
up
to
draw
down
the
window
curtain
at
her
back
under
the
low
white
ceiling
a
crude
light
filled
the
cabin
frederick
sitting
opposite
to
the
place
where
she
sat
could
distinguish
the
shade
of
her
eyelashes
she
just
moistened
her
lips
with
her
glass
and
broke
a
little
piece
of
crust
between
her
fingers
the
locket
fastened
by
a
little
gold
chain
to
her
wrist
made
a
ringing
sound
every
now
and
then
as
it
touched
her
plate
those
present
however
did
not
appear
to
notice
it
at
intervals
one
could
see
through
the
small
portholes
the
side
of
a
boat
taking
away
passengers
or
putting
them
on
board
those
who
sat
round
the
tables
stooped
towards
the
openings
and
called
out
the
names
of
the
various
places
they
passed
along
the
river
arnoux
complained
of
the
cooking
he
grumbled
particularly
at
the
amount
of
the
bill
and
got
it
reduced
then
he
carried
off
the
young
man
towards
the
forecastle
to
drink
a
glass
of
grog
with
him
but
frederick
speedily
came
back
again
to
gaze
at
madame
arnoux
who
had
returned
to
the
awning
beneath
which
she
seated
herself
she
was
reading
a
thin
volume
from
time
to
time
the
corners
of
her
mouth
curled
and
a
gleam
of
pleasure
lighted
up
her
forehead
he
felt
jealous
of
the
inventor
of
those
things
which
appeared
to
interest
her
so
much
the
more
he
contemplated
her
the
more
he
felt
that
there
were
yawning
abysses
between
them
he
was
reflecting
that
he
should
very
soon
lose
sight
of
her
irrevocably
without
having
extracted
a
few
words
from
her
without
leaving
her
even
a
souvenir
on
the
right
a
plain
stretched
out
on
the
left
a
strip
of
rose
gently
to
meet
a
hillock
where
one
could
see
vineyards
groups
of
a
mill
embedded
in
the
grassy
slopes
and
beyond
that
little
zigzag
paths
over
the
white
mass
of
rocks
that
reached
up
towards
the
clouds
what
bliss
it
would
have
been
to
ascend
side
by
side
with
her
his
arm
around
her
waist
while
her
gown
would
sweep
the
yellow
leaves
listening
to
her
voice
and
gazing
up
into
her
glowing
eyes
the
steamboat
might
stop
and
all
they
would
have
to
do
was
to
step
out
of
it
and
yet
this
thing
simple
as
it
might
be
was
not
less
difficult
than
it
would
have
been
to
move
the
sun
a
little
further
on
a
château
appeared
with
pointed
roof
and
square
turrets
a
flower
garden
spread
out
in
the
foreground
and
avenues
ran
like
dark
archways
under
the
tall
linden
trees
he
pictured
her
to
himself
passing
along
by
this
group
of
trees
at
that
moment
a
young
lady
and
a
young
man
showed
themselves
on
the
steps
in
front
of
the
house
between
the
trunks
of
the
orange
trees
then
the
entire
scene
vanished
the
little
girl
kept
skipping
playfully
around
the
place
where
he
had
stationed
himself
on
the
deck
frederick
wished
to
kiss
her
she
hid
herself
behind
her
nurse
her
mother
scolded
her
for
not
being
nice
to
the
gentleman
who
had
rescued
her
own
shawl
was
this
an
indirect
overture
is
she
going
to
speak
to
me
he
asked
himself
time
was
flying
how
was
he
to
get
an
invitation
to
the
arnoux
house
and
he
could
think
of
nothing
better
than
to
draw
her
attention
to
the
autumnal
hues
adding
we
are
close
to
winter
the
season
of
balls
and
but
arnoux
was
entirely
occupied
with
his
luggage
they
had
arrived
at
the
point
of
the
river
bank
facing
surville
the
two
bridges
drew
nearer
they
passed
a
ropewalk
then
a
range
of
houses
inside
which
there
were
pots
of
tar
and
splinters
of
wood
and
brats
went
along
the
sand
turning
head
over
heels
frederick
recognised
a
man
with
a
sleeved
waistcoat
and
called
out
to
him
make
haste
they
were
at
the
he
looked
around
anxiously
for
arnoux
amongst
the
crowd
of
passengers
and
the
other
came
and
shook
hands
with
him
saying
a
pleasant
time
dear
monsieur
when
he
was
on
the
quay
frederick
turned
around
she
was
standing
beside
the
helm
he
cast
a
look
towards
her
into
which
he
tried
to
put
his
whole
soul
she
remained
motionless
as
if
he
had
done
nothing
then
without
paying
the
slightest
attentions
to
the
obeisances
of
his
why
did
you
bring
the
trap
down
here
the
man
made
excuses
what
a
clumsy
fellow
you
are
give
me
some
money
and
after
that
he
went
off
to
get
something
to
eat
at
an
inn
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
he
felt
an
inclination
to
turn
into
the
coachyard
as
if
by
chance
perhaps
he
would
see
her
again
what
the
use
of
it
said
he
to
himself
the
vehicle
carried
him
off
the
two
horses
did
not
belong
to
his
mother
she
had
borrowed
one
of
chambrion
the
in
order
to
have
it
yoked
alongside
of
her
own
isidore
having
set
forth
the
day
before
had
taken
a
rest
at
bray
until
evening
and
had
slept
at
montereau
so
that
the
animals
with
restored
vigour
were
trotting
briskly
fields
on
which
the
crops
had
been
cut
stretched
out
in
apparently
endless
succession
and
by
degrees
villeneuve
georges
ablon
châtillon
corbeil
and
the
other
places
his
entire
journey
came
back
to
his
recollection
with
such
vividness
that
he
could
now
recall
to
mind
fresh
details
more
intimate
particulars
under
the
lowest
flounce
of
her
gown
her
foot
showed
itself
encased
in
a
dainty
silk
boot
of
maroon
shade
the
awning
made
of
ticking
formed
a
wide
canopy
over
her
head
and
the
little
red
tassels
of
the
edging
kept
perpetually
trembling
in
the
breeze
she
resembled
the
women
of
whom
he
had
read
in
romances
he
would
have
added
nothing
to
the
charms
of
her
person
and
would
have
taken
nothing
from
them
the
universe
had
suddenly
become
enlarged
she
was
the
luminous
point
towards
which
all
things
converged
and
rocked
by
the
movement
of
the
vehicle
with
eyelids
and
his
face
turned
towards
the
clouds
he
abandoned
himself
to
a
dreamy
infinite
joy
at
bray
he
did
not
wait
till
the
horses
had
got
their
oats
he
walked
on
along
the
road
ahead
by
himself
arnoux
had
when
he
spoke
to
her
addressed
her
as
marie
he
now
loudly
repeated
the
name
marie
his
voice
pierced
the
air
and
was
lost
in
the
distance
the
western
sky
was
one
great
mass
of
flaming
purple
huge
stacks
of
wheat
rising
up
in
the
midst
of
the
stubble
fields
projected
giant
shadows
a
dog
began
to
bark
in
a
in
the
distance
he
shivered
seized
with
disquietude
for
which
he
could
assign
no
cause
when
isidore
had
come
up
with
him
he
jumped
up
into
the
front
seat
to
drive
his
fit
of
weakness
was
past
he
had
thoroughly
made
up
his
mind
to
effect
an
introduction
into
the
house
of
the
arnoux
and
to
become
intimate
with
them
their
house
should
be
amusing
besides
he
liked
arnoux
then
who
could
tell
thereupon
a
wave
of
blood
rushed
up
to
his
face
his
temples
throbbed
he
cracked
his
whip
shook
the
reins
and
set
the
horses
going
at
such
a
pace
that
the
old
coachman
repeatedly
exclaimed
easy
easy
now
or
they
get
gradually
frederick
calmed
down
and
he
listened
to
what
the
man
was
saying
monsieur
return
was
impatiently
awaited
mademoiselle
louise
had
cried
in
her
anxiety
to
go
in
the
trap
to
meet
him
who
pray
is
mademoiselle
louise
monsieur
roque
little
girl
you
know
ah
i
had
forgotten
rejoined
frederick
carelessly
meanwhile
the
two
horses
could
keep
up
the
pace
no
longer
they
were
both
getting
lame
and
nine
struck
at
laurent
when
he
arrived
at
the
parade
in
front
of
his
mother
house
this
house
of
large
dimensions
with
a
garden
looking
out
on
the
open
country
added
to
the
social
importance
of
madame
moreau
who
was
the
most
respected
lady
in
the
district
she
came
of
an
old
family
of
nobles
of
which
the
male
line
was
now
extinct
her
husband
a
plebeian
whom
her
parents
forced
her
to
marry
met
his
death
by
a
during
her
pregnancy
leaving
her
an
estate
much
encumbered
she
received
visitors
three
times
a
week
and
from
time
to
time
gave
a
fashionable
dinner
but
the
number
of
wax
candles
was
calculated
beforehand
and
she
looked
forward
with
some
impatience
to
the
payment
of
her
rents
these
pecuniary
embarrassments
concealed
as
if
there
were
some
guilt
attached
to
them
imparted
a
certain
gravity
to
her
character
nevertheless
she
displayed
no
prudery
no
sourness
in
the
practice
of
her
peculiar
virtue
her
most
trifling
charities
seemed
munificent
alms
she
was
consulted
about
the
selection
of
servants
the
education
of
young
girls
and
the
art
of
making
preserves
and
monseigneur
used
to
stay
at
her
house
on
the
occasion
of
his
episcopal
visitations
madame
moreau
cherished
a
lofty
ambition
for
her
son
through
a
sort
of
prudence
grounded
on
the
expectation
of
favours
she
did
not
care
to
hear
blame
cast
on
the
government
he
would
need
patronage
at
the
start
then
with
its
aid
he
might
become
a
councillor
of
state
an
ambassador
a
minister
his
triumphs
at
the
college
of
sens
warranted
this
proud
anticipation
he
had
carried
off
there
the
prize
of
honour
when
he
entered
the
all
present
arose
with
a
great
racket
he
was
embraced
and
the
chairs
large
and
small
were
drawn
up
in
a
big
around
the
fireplace
gamblin
immediately
asked
him
what
was
his
opinion
about
madame
lafarge
this
case
the
rage
of
the
period
did
not
fail
to
lead
to
a
violent
discussion
madame
moreau
stopped
it
to
the
regret
however
of
gamblin
he
deemed
it
serviceable
to
the
young
man
in
his
character
of
a
future
lawyer
and
nettled
at
what
had
occurred
he
left
the
nothing
should
have
caused
surprise
on
the
part
of
a
friend
of
père
roque
the
reference
to
père
roque
led
them
to
talk
of
dambreuse
who
had
just
become
the
owner
of
the
demesne
of
la
fortelle
but
the
had
drawn
frederick
aside
to
know
what
he
thought
of
guizot
latest
work
they
were
all
anxious
to
get
some
information
about
his
private
affairs
and
madame
benoît
went
cleverly
to
work
with
that
end
in
view
by
inquiring
about
his
uncle
how
was
that
worthy
relative
they
no
longer
heard
from
him
had
he
not
a
distant
cousin
in
america
the
cook
announced
that
monsieur
soup
was
served
the
guests
discreetly
retired
then
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
in
the
his
mother
said
to
him
in
a
low
tone
well
the
old
man
had
received
him
in
a
very
cordial
manner
but
without
disclosing
his
intentions
madame
moreau
sighed
where
is
she
now
was
his
thought
the
diligence
was
rolling
along
the
road
and
wrapped
up
in
the
shawl
no
doubt
she
was
leaning
against
the
cloth
of
the
coupé
her
beautiful
head
nodding
asleep
he
and
his
mother
were
just
going
up
to
their
apartments
when
a
waiter
from
the
swan
of
the
cross
brought
him
a
note
what
is
that
pray
it
is
deslauriers
who
wants
me
said
he
ha
your
chum
said
madame
moreau
with
a
contemptuous
sneer
certainly
it
is
a
nice
hour
to
select
frederick
hesitated
but
friendship
was
stronger
he
got
his
hat
at
any
rate
do

had
married

with
the
amount
of
the
dowry
bought
up
the
business
of
a
which
brought
him
barely
enough
to
maintain
him
embittered
by
a
long
course
of
unjust
treatment
suffering
still
from
the
effects
of
old
wounds
and
always
regretting
the
emperor
he
vented
on
those
around
him
the
fits
of
rage
that
seemed
to
choke
him

so
many
whackings
as
his

not

she
tried
to
interpose

also
finally
the
captain
planted
the
boy
in
his
office
and
all
the
day
long
kept
him
bent
over
his
desk
copying
documents
with
the
result
that
his
right
shoulder
was
noticeably
higher
than

the
french

a

it

generally
the

not
be
understood

its

this

is
sometimes
a
lucrative
translator
in
on
the
invitation
of
the
president
the
captain
sold
his
office
his
wife
died
of
cancer
he
then
went
to
live
at
dijon
after
that
he
started
in
business
at
troyes
where
he
was
connected
with
the
slave
trade
and
having
obtained
a
small
scholarship
for
charles
placed
him
at
the
college
of
sens
where
frederick
came
across
him
but
one
of
the
pair
was
twelve
years
old
while
the
other
was
fifteen
besides
a
thousand
differences
of
character
and
origin
tended
to
keep
them
apart
frederick
had
in
his
chest
of
drawers
all
sorts
of
useful
things
choice
articles
such
as
a
he
liked
to
lie
late
in
bed
in
the
morning
to
look
at
the
swallows
and
to
read
plays
and
regretting
the
comforts
of
home
he
thought
college
life
rough
to
the
son
it
seemed
a
pleasant
life
he
worked
so
hard
that
at
the
end
of
the
second
year
he
had
got
into
the
third
form
however
owing
to
his
poverty
or
to
his
quarrelsome
disposition
he
was
regarded
with
intense
dislike
but
when
on
one
occasion
in
the
courtyard
where
pupils
of
the
middle
grade
took
exercise
an
attendant
openly
called
him
a
child
he
sprang
at
the
fellow
throat
and
would
have
killed
him
if
three
of
the
ushers
had
not
intervened
frederick
carried
away
by
admiration
pressed
him
in
his
arms
from
that
day
forward
they
became
fast
friends
the
affection
of
a
no
doubt
flattered
the
vanity
of
the
youth
of
meaner
rank
and
the
other
accepted
as
a
piece
of
good
fortune
this
devotion
freely
offered
to
him
during
the
holidays
charles
father
allowed
him
to
remain
in
the
college
a
translation
of
plato
which
he
opened
by
chance
excited
his
enthusiasm
then
he
became
smitten
with
a
love
of
metaphysical
studies
and
he
made
rapid
progress
for
he
approached
the
subject
with
all
the
energy
of
youth
and
the
of
an
emancipated
intellect
jouffroy
cousin
laromiguière
malebranche
and
the
scotch
metaphysicians
everything
that
could
be
found
in
the
library
dealing
with
this
branch
of
knowledge
passed
through
his
hands
he
found
it
necessary
to
steal
the
key
in
order
to
get
the
books
frederick
intellectual
distractions
were
of
a
less
serious
description
he
made
sketches
of
the
genealogy
of
christ
carved
on
a
post
in
the
rue
des
trois
rois
then
of
the
gateway
of
a
cathedral
after
a
course
of
mediæval
dramas
he
took
up
memoirs
froissart
comines
pierre
de
and
brantôme
the
impressions
made
on
his
mind
by
this
kind
of
reading
took
such
a
hold
of
it
that
he
felt
a
need
within
him
of
reproducing
those
pictures
of
bygone
days
his
ambition
was
to
be
one
day
the
walter
scott
of
france
deslauriers
dreamed
of
formulating
a
vast
system
of
philosophy
which
might
have
the
most
applications
they
chatted
over
all
these
matters
at
recreation
hours
in
the
playground
in
front
of
the
moral
inscription
painted
under
the
clock
they
kept
whispering
to
each
other
about
them
in
the
chapel
even
with
louis
staring
down
at
them
they
dreamed
about
them
in
the
dormitory
which
looked
out
on
a
on
they
took
up
a
position
behind
the
others
and
talked
without
stopping
they
spoke
of
what
they
would
do
later
when
they
had
left
college
first
of
all
they
would
set
out
on
a
long
voyage
with
the
money
which
frederick
would
take
out
of
his
own
fortune
on
reaching
his
majority
then
they
would
come
back
to
paris
they
would
work
together
and
would
never
part
and
as
a
relaxation
from
their
labours
they
would
have
with
princesses
in
boudoirs
lined
with
satin
or
dazzling
orgies
with
famous
courtesans
their
rapturous
expectations
were
followed
by
doubts
after
a
crisis
of
verbose
gaiety
they
would
often
lapse
into
profound
silence
on
summer
evenings
when
they
had
been
walking
for
a
long
time
over
stony
paths
which
bordered
on
vineyards
or
on
the
in
the
open
country
and
when
they
saw
the
wheat
waving
in
the
sunlight
while
the
air
was
filled
with
the
fragrance
of
angelica
a
sort
of
suffocating
sensation
took
possession
of
them
and
they
stretched
themselves
on
their
backs
dizzy
intoxicated
meanwhile
the
other
lads
in
their
were
playing
at
base
or
flying
kites
then
as
the
usher
called
in
the
two
companions
from
the
playground
they
would
return
taking
the
path
which
led
along
by
the
gardens
watered
by
brooklets
then
they
would
pass
through
the
boulevards
overshadowed
by
the
old
city
walls
the
deserted
streets
rang
under
their
tread
the
grating
flew
back
they
ascended
the
stairs
and
they
felt
as
sad
as
if
they
had
had
a
great
debauch
the
proctor
maintained
that
they
mutually
cried
up
each
other
nevertheless
if
frederick
worked
his
way
up
to
the
higher
forms
it
was
through
the
exhortations
of
his
friend
and
during
the
vacation
in
he
brought
deslauriers
to
his
mother
house
madame
moreau
disliked
the
young
man
he
had
a
terrible
appetite
he
was
fond
of
making
republican
speeches
to
crown
all
she
got
it
into
her
head
that
he
had
been
the
means
of
leading
her
son
into
improper
places
their
relations
towards
each
other
were
watched
this
only
made
their
friendship
grow
stronger
and
they
bade
one
another
adieu
with
heartfelt
pangs
when
in
the
following
year
deslauriers
left
the
college
in
order
to
study
law
in
paris
frederick
anxiously
looked
forward
to
the
time
when
they
would
meet
again
for
two
years
they
had
not
laid
eyes
on
each
other
and
when
their
embraces
were
over
they
walked
over
the
bridges
to
talk
more
at
their
ease
the
captain
who
had
now
set
up
a
at
villenauxe
reddened
with
anger
when
his
son
called
for
an
account
of
the
expense
of
tutelage
and
even
cut
down
the
cost
of
victuals
to
the
lowest
figure
but
as
he
intended
to
become
a
candidate
at
a
later
period
for
a
professor
chair
at
the
school
and
as
he
had
no
money
deslauriers
accepted
the
post
of
principal
clerk
in
an
attorney
office
at
troyes
by
dint
of
sheer
privation
he
spared
four
thousand
francs
and
by
not
drawing
upon
the
sum
which
came
to
him
through
his
mother
he
would
always
have
enough
to
enable
him
to
work
freely
for
three
years
while
he
was
waiting
for
a
better
position
it
was
necessary
therefore
to
abandon
their
former
project
of
living
together
in
the
capital
at
least
for
the
present
frederick
hung
down
his
head
this
was
the
first
of
his
dreams
which
had
crumbled
into
dust
be
consoled
said
the
captain
son
life
is
long
we
are
young
we
meet
again
think
no
more
about
it
he
shook
the
other
hand
warmly
and
to
distract
his
attention
questioned
him
about
his
journey
frederick
had
nothing
to
tell
but
at
the
recollection
of
madame
arnoux
his
vexation
disappeared
he
did
not
refer
to
her
restrained
by
a
feeling
of
bashfulness
he
made
up
for
it
by
expatiating
on
arnoux
recalling
his
talk
his
agreeable
manner
his
stories
and
deslauriers
urged
him
strongly
to
cultivate
this
new
acquaintance
frederick
had
of
late
written
nothing
his
literary
opinions
were
changed
passion
was
now
above
everything
else
in
his
estimation
he
was
equally
enthusiastic
about
werther
rené
franck
lara
lélia
and
other
ideal
creations
of
less
merit
sometimes
it
seemed
to
him
that
music
alone
was
capable
of
giving
expression
to
his
internal
agitation
then
he
dreamed
of
symphonies
or
else
the
surface
of
things
seized
hold
of
him
and
he
longed
to
paint
he
had
however
composed
verses
deslauriers
considered
them
beautiful
but
did
not
ask
him
to
write
another
poem
as
for
himself
he
had
given
up
metaphysics
social
economy
and
the
french
revolution
absorbed
all
his
attention
just
now
he
was
a
tall
fellow
of
thin
with
a
wide
mouth
and
a
resolute
look
on
this
particular
evening
he
wore
a
paletot
of
lasting
and
his
shoes
were
white
with
dust
for
he
had
come
all
the
way
from
villenauxe
on
foot
for
the
express
purpose
of
seeing
frederick
isidore
arrived
while
they
were
talking
madame
begged
of
monsieur
to
return
home
and
for
fear
of
his
catching
cold
she
had
sent
him
his
cloak
wait
a
bit
said
deslauriers
and
they
continued
walking
from
one
end
to
the
other
of
the
two
bridges
which
rest
on
the
narrow
islet
formed
by
the
canal
and
the
river
when
they
were
walking
on
the
side
towards
nogent
they
had
exactly
in
front
of
them
a
block
of
houses
which
projected
a
little
at
the
right
might
be
seen
the
church
behind
the
mills
in
the
wood
whose
sluices
had
been
closed
up
and
at
the
left
the
hedges
covered
with
shrubs
along
the
skirts
of
the
wood
formed
a
boundary
for
the
gardens
which
could
scarcely
be
distinguished
but
on
the
side
towards
paris
the
high
road
formed
a
sheer
descending
line
and
the
meadows
lost
themselves
in
the
distance
under
the
vapours
of
the
night
silence
reigned
along
this
road
whose
white
track
clearly
showed
itself
through
the
surrounding
gloom
odours
of
damp
leaves
ascended
towards
them
the
waterfall
where
the
stream
had
been
diverted
from
its
course
a
hundred
paces
further
away
kept
rumbling
with
that
deep
harmonious
sound
which
waves
make
in
the
night
time
deslauriers
stopped
and
said
is
funny
to
have
these
worthy
folks
sleeping
so
quietly
patience
a
new
is
in
preparation
people
are
tired
of
constitutions
charters
subtleties
lies
ah
if
i
had
a
newspaper
or
a
platform
how
i
would
shake
off
all
these
things
but
in
order
to
undertake
anything
whatever
money
is
required
what
a
curse
it
is
to
be
a
son
and
to
waste
one
youth
in
quest
of
bread
he
hung
down
his
head
bit
his
lips
and
shivered
under
his
threadbare
overcoat
frederick
flung
half
his
cloak
over
his
friend
shoulder
they
both
wrapped
themselves
up
in
it
and
with
their
arms
around
each
waists
they
walked
down
the
road
side
by
side
how
do
you
think
i
can
live
over
there
without
you
said
frederick
the
bitter
tone
of
his
friend
had
brought
back
his
own
sadness
i
would
have
done
something
with
a
woman
who
loved
me
what
are
you
laughing
at
love
is
the
and
as
it
were
the
atmosphere
of
genius
extraordinary
emotions
produce
sublime
works
as
for
seeking
after
her
whom
i
want
i
give
that
up
besides
if
i
should
ever
find
her
she
will
repel
me
i
belong
to
the
race
of
the
disinherited
and
i
shall
be
extinguished
with
a
treasure
that
will
be
of
paste
or
of
diamond
i
know
not
which
somebody
shadow
fell
across
the
road
and
at
the
same
time
they
heard
these
words
excuse
me
gentlemen
the
person
who
had
uttered
them
was
a
little
man
attired
in
an
ample
brown
and
with
a
cap
on
his
head
which
under
its
peak
afforded
a
glimpse
of
a
sharp
nose
monsieur
roque
said
frederick
the
very
man
returned
the
voice
this
resident
in
the
locality
explained
his
presence
by
stating
that
he
had
come
back
to
inspect
the
in
his
garden
near
the
and
so
you
are
back
again
in
the
old
spot
very
good
i
ascertained
the
fact
through
my
little
girl
your
health
is
good
i
hope
you
are
not
going
away
again
then
he
left
them
repelled
probably
by
frederick
chilling
reception
madame
moreau
indeed
was
not
on
visiting
terms
with
him
père
roque
lived
in
peculiar
relations
with
his
and
was
held
in
very
slight
esteem
although
he
was
the
at
elections
and
dambreuse
manager
the
banker
who
resides
in
the
rue
observed
deslauriers
do
you
know
what
you
ought
to
do
my
fine
fellow
isidore
once
more
interrupted
his
orders
were
positive
not
to
go
back
without
frederick
madame
would
be
getting
uneasy
at
his
absence
well
well
he
will
go
back
said
deslauriers
he
not
going
to
stay
out
all
night
and
as
soon
as
the
had
disappeared
you
ought
to
ask
that
old
chap
to
introduce
you
to
the
dambreuses
there
nothing
so
useful
as
to
be
a
visitor
at
a
rich
man
house
since
you
have
a
black
coat
and
white
gloves
make
use
of
them
you
must
mix
in
that
set
you
can
introduce
me
into
it
later
just
think
a
man
worth
millions
do
all
you
can
to
make
him
like
you
and
his
wife
too
become
her
lover
frederick
uttered
an
exclamation
by
way
of
protest
why
i
can
quote
classical
examples
for
you
on
that
point
i
rather
think
remember
rastignac
in
the
you
will
succeed
i
have
no
doubt
frederick
had
so
much
confidence
in
deslauriers
that
he
felt
his
firmness
giving
way
and
forgetting
madame
arnoux
or
including
her
in
the
prediction
made
with
regard
to
the
other
he
could
not
keep
from
smiling
the
clerk
added
a
last
piece
of
advice
pass
your
examinations
it
is
always
a
good
thing
to
have
a
handle
to
your
name
and
without
more
ado
give
up
your
catholic
and
satanic
poets
whose
philosophy
is
as
old
as
the
twelfth
century
your
despair
is
silly
the
very
greatest
men
have
had
more
difficult
beginnings
as
in
the
case
of
mirabeau
besides
our
separation
will
not
be
so
long
i
will
make
that
pickpocket
of
a
father
of
mine
disgorge
it
is
time
for
me
to
be
going
back
farewell
have
you
got
a
hundred
sous
to
pay
for
my
dinner
frederick
gave
him
ten
francs
what
was
left
of
those
he
had
got
that
morning
from
isidore
meanwhile
some
forty
yards
away
from
the
bridges
a
light
shone
from
the
of
a
house
deslauriers
noticed
it
then
he
said
emphatically
as
he
took
off
his
hat
your
pardon
venus
queen
of
heaven
but
penury
is
the
mother
of
wisdom
we
have
been
slandered
enough
for
that
so
have
mercy
this
allusion
to
an
adventure
in
which
they
had
both
taken
part
put
them
into
a
jovial
mood
they
laughed
loudly
as
they
passed
through
the
streets
then
having
settled
his
bill
at
the
inn
deslauriers
walked
back
with
frederick
as
far
as
the
crossway
near
the
and
after
a
long
embrace
the
two
friends
parted
chapter
iii
sentiment
and
passion
two
months
later
frederick
having
debarked
one
morning
in
the
rue
immediately
thought
of
paying
his
great
visit
chance
came
to
his
aid
père
roque
had
brought
him
a
roll
of
papers
and
requested
him
to
deliver
them
up
himself
to
dambreuse
and
the
worthy
man
accompanied
the
package
with
an
open
letter
of
introduction
in
behalf
of
his
young
madame
moreau
appeared
surprised
at
this
proceeding
frederick
concealed
the
delight
that
it
gave
him
dambreuse
real
name
was
the
count
but
since
gradually
abandoning
his
title
of
nobility
and
his
party
he
had
turned
his
attention
to
business
and
with
his
ears
open
in
every
office
his
hand
in
every
enterprise
on
the
watch
for
every
opportunity
as
subtle
as
a
greek
and
as
laborious
as
a
native
of
auvergne
he
had
amassed
a
fortune
which
might
be
called
considerable
furthermore
he
was
an
officer
of
the
legion
of
honour
a
member
of
the
general
council
of
the
aube
a
deputy
and
one
of
these
days
would
be
a
peer
of
france
however
affable
as
he
was
in
other
respects
he
wearied
the
minister
by
his
continual
applications
for
relief
for
crosses
and
licences
for
tobacconists
shops
and
in
his
complaints
against
authority
he
was
inclined
to
join
the
left
centre
his
wife
the
pretty
madame
dambreuse
of
whom
mention
was
made
in
the
fashion
journals
presided
at
charitable
assemblies
by
wheedling
the
duchesses
she
appeased
the
rancours
of
the
aristocratic
faubourg
and
led
the
residents
to
believe
that
dambreuse
might
yet
repent
and
render
them
some
services
the
young
man
was
agitated
when
he
called
on
them
i
should
have
done
better
to
take
my
with
me
no
doubt
they
will
give
me
an
invitation
to
next
week
ball
what
will
they
say
to
me
his
returned
when
he
reflected
that
dambreuse
was
only
a
person
of
the
middle
class
and
he
sprang
out
of
the
cab
briskly
on
the
pavement
of
the
rue
when
he
had
pushed
forward
one
of
the
two
gateways
he
crossed
the
courtyard
mounted
the
steps
in
front
of
the
house
and
entered
a
vestibule
paved
with
coloured
marble
a
straight
double
staircase
with
red
carpet
fastened
with
copper
rods
rested
against
the
high
walls
of
shining
stucco
at
the
end
of
the
stairs
there
was
a
whose
wide
leaves
fell
down
over
the
velvet
of
the
baluster
two
bronze
candelabra
with
porcelain
globes
hung
from
little
chains
the
atmosphere
was
heavy
with
the
fumes
exhaled
by
the
of
the
stoves
and
all
that
could
be
heard
was
the
ticking
of
a
big
clock
fixed
at
the
other
end
of
the
vestibule
under
a
suit
of
armour
a
bell
rang
a
valet
made
his
appearance
and
introduced
frederick
into
a
little
apartment
where
one
could
observe
two
strong
boxes
with
filled
with
pieces
of
pasteboard
in
the
centre
of
it
dambreuse
was
writing
at
a
desk
he
ran
his
eye
over
père
roque
letter
tore
open
the
canvas
in
which
the
papers
had
been
wrapped
and
examined
them
at
some
distance
he
presented
the
appearance
of
being
still
young
owing
to
his
slight
figure
but
his
thin
white
hair
his
feeble
limbs
and
above
all
the
extraordinary
pallor
of
his
face
betrayed
a
shattered
constitution
there
was
an
expression
of
pitiless
energy
in
his
eyes
colder
than
eyes
of
glass
his
projected
and
his
were
knotted
at
length
he
arose
and
addressed
to
the
young
man
a
few
questions
with
regard
to
persons
of
their
acquaintance
at
nogent
and
also
with
regard
to
his
studies
and
then
dismissed
him
with
a
bow
frederick
went
out
through
another
lobby
and
found
himself
at
the
lower
end
of
the
courtyard
near
the
a
blue
brougham
to
which
a
black
horse
was
yoked
stood
in
front
of
the
steps
before
the
house
the
carriage
door
flew
open
a
lady
sprang
in
and
the
vehicle
with
a
rumbling
noise
went
rolling
along
the
gravel
frederick
had
come
up
to
the
courtyard
gate
from
the
other
side
at
the
same
moment
as
there
was
not
room
enough
to
allow
him
to
pass
he
was
compelled
to
wait
the
young
lady
with
her
head
thrust
forward
past
the
carriage
blind
talked
to
the
in
a
very
low
tone
all
he
could
see
was
her
back
covered
with
a
violet
mantle
however
he
took
a
glance
into
the
interior
of
the
carriage
lined
with
blue
rep
with
silk
lace
and
fringes
the
lady
ample
robes
filled
up
the
space
within
he
stole
away
from
this
little
padded
box
with
its
perfume
of
iris
and
so
to
speak
its
vague
odour
of
feminine
elegance
the
coachman
slackened
the
reins
the
horse
brushed
abruptly
past
the
and
all
disappeared
frederick
returned
on
foot
following
the
track
of
the
boulevard
he
regretted
not
having
been
able
to
get
a
proper
view
of
madame
dambreuse
a
little
higher
than
the
rue
montmartre
a
regular
jumble
of
vehicles
made
him
turn
round
his
head
and
on
the
opposite
side
facing
him
he
read
on
a
marble
plate
jacques
arnoux
how
was
it
that
he
had
not
thought
about
her
sooner
it
was
fault
and
he
approached
the
shop
which
however
he
did
not
enter
he
was
waiting
for
to
appear
the
high
transparent
windows
presented
to
one
gaze
statuettes
drawings
engravings
catalogues
and
numbers
of
arranged
in
a
skilful
fashion
and
the
amounts
of
the
subscription
were
repeated
on
the
door
which
was
decorated
in
the
centre
with
the
publisher
initials
against
the
walls
could
be
seen
large
pictures
whose
varnish
had
a
shiny
look
two
chests
laden
with
porcelain
bronze
alluring
curiosities
a
little
staircase
separated
them
shut
off
at
the
top
by
a
wilton
portière
and
a
lustre
of
old
saxe
a
green
carpet
on
the
floor
with
a
table
of
marqueterie
gave
to
this
interior
the
appearance
rather
of
a
than
of
a
shop
frederick
pretended
to
be
examining
the
drawings
after
hesitating
for
a
long
time
he
went
in
a
clerk
lifted
the
portière
and
in
reply
to
a
question
said
that
monsieur
would
not
be
in
the
shop
before
five
but
if
the
message
could
be
conveyed
no
i
come
back
again
frederick
answered
blandly
the
following
days
were
spent
in
searching
for
lodgings
and
he
fixed
upon
an
apartment
in
a
second
story
of
a
furnished
mansion
in
the
rue
hyacinthe
with
a
fresh
under
his
arm
he
set
forth
to
attend
the
opening
lecture
of
the
course
three
hundred
young
men
filled
an
amphitheatre
where
an
old
man
in
a
red
gown
was
delivering
a
discourse
in
a
monotonous
voice
quill
pens
went
scratching
over
the
paper
in
this
hall
he
found
once
more
the
dusty
odour
of
the
school
a
of
similar
shape
the
same
wearisome
monotony
for
a
fortnight
he
regularly
continued
his
attendance
at
law
lectures
but
he
left
off
the
study
of
the
civil
code
before
getting
as
far
as
article
and
he
gave
up
the
institutes
at
the
divisio
the
pleasures
that
he
had
promised
himself
did
not
come
to
him
and
when
he
had
exhausted
a
circulating
library
gone
over
the
collections
in
the
louvre
and
been
at
the
theatre
a
great
many
nights
in
succession
he
sank
into
the
lowest
depths
of
idleness
his
depression
was
increased
by
a
thousand
fresh
annoyances
he
found
it
necessary
to
count
his
linen
and
to
bear
with
the
door
keeper
a
bore
with
the
figure
of
a
male
hospital
nurse
who
came
in
the
morning
to
make
up
his
bed
smelling
of
alcohol
and
grunting
he
did
not
like
his
apartment
which
was
ornamented
with
an
alabaster
the
partitions
were
thin
he
could
hear
the
students
making
punch
laughing
and
singing
tired
of
this
solitude
he
sought
out
one
of
his
old
schoolfellows
named
baptiste
martinon
and
he
discovered
this
friend
of
his
boyhood
in
a
in
the
rue
cramming
up
legal
procedure
before
a
coal
fire
a
woman
in
a
print
dress
sat
opposite
him
darning
his
socks
martinon
was
what
people
call
a
very
fine
man
big
chubby
with
a
regular
physiognomy
and
blue
eyes
far
up
in
his
face
his
father
an
extensive
had
destined
him
for
the
magistracy
and
wishing
already
to
present
a
grave
exterior
he
wore
his
beard
cut
like
a
collar
round
his
neck
as
there
was
no
rational
foundation
for
frederick
complaints
and
as
he
could
not
give
evidence
of
any
misfortune
martinon
was
unable
in
any
way
to
understand
his
lamentations
about
existence
as
for
him
he
went
every
morning
to
the
school
after
that
took
a
walk
in
the
luxembourg
in
the
evening
swallowed
his
of
coffee
and
with
fifteen
hundred
francs
a
year
and
the
love
of
this
workwoman
he
felt
perfectly
happy
what
happiness
was
frederick
internal
comment
at
the
school
he
had
formed
another
acquaintance
a
youth
of
aristocratic
family
who
on
account
of
his
dainty
manners
suggested
a
resemblance
to
a
young
lady
de
cisy
devoted
himself
to
drawing
and
loved
the
gothic
style
they
frequently
went
together
to
admire
the
and
nôtre
dame
but
the
young
patrician
rank
and
pretensions
covered
an
intellect
of
the
feeblest
order
everything
took
him
by
surprise
he
laughed
immoderately
at
the
most
trifling
joke
and
displayed
such
utter
simplicity
that
frederick
at
first
took
him
for
a
wag
and
finally
regarded
him
as
a
booby
the
young
man
found
it
impossible
therefore
to
be
effusive
with
anyone
and
he
was
constantly
looking
forward
to
an
invitation
from
the
dambreuses
on
new
year
day
he
sent
them
but
received
none
in
return
he
made
his
way
back
to
the
office
of
a
third
time
he
returned
to
it
and
at
last
saw
arnoux
carrying
on
an
argument
with
five
or
six
persons
around
him
he
scarcely
responded
to
the
young
man
bow
and
frederick
was
wounded
by
this
reception
none
the
less
he
cogitated
over
the
best
means
of
finding
his
way
to
her
side
his
first
idea
was
to
come
frequently
to
the
shop
on
the
pretext
of
getting
pictures
at
low
prices
then
he
conceived
the
notion
of
slipping
into
the
of
the
journal
a
few
very
strong
articles
which
might
lead
to
friendly
relations
perhaps
it
would
be
better
to
go
straight
to
the
mark
at
once
and
declare
his
love
acting
on
this
impulse
he
wrote
a
letter
covering
a
dozen
pages
full
of
lyric
movements
and
apostrophes
but
he
tore
it
up
and
did
nothing
attempted
nothing
bereft
of
motive
power
by
his
want
of
success
above
arnoux
shop
there
were
on
the
first
floor
three
windows
which
were
lighted
up
every
evening
shadows
might
be
seen
moving
about
behind
them
especially
one
this
was
hers
and
he
went
very
far
out
of
his
way
in
order
to
gaze
at
these
windows
and
to
contemplate
this
shadow
a
negress
who
crossed
his
path
one
day
in
the
tuileries
holding
a
little
girl
by
the
hand
recalled
to
his
mind
madame
arnoux
negress
she
was
sure
to
come
there
like
the
others
every
time
he
passed
through
the
tuileries
his
heart
began
to
beat
with
the
anticipation
of
meeting
her
on
sunny
days
he
continued
his
walk
as
far
as
the
end
of
the
women
seated
with
careless
ease
in
open
carriages
and
with
their
veils
floating
in
the
wind
filed
past
close
to
him
their
horses
advancing
at
a
steady
walking
pace
and
with
an
unconscious
movement
that
made
the
varnished
leather
of
the
harness
crackle
the
vehicles
became
more
numerous
and
slackening
their
motion
after
they
had
passed
the
circular
space
where
the
roads
met
they
took
up
the
entire
track
the
horses
manes
and
the
carriage
lamps
were
close
to
each
other
the
steel
stirrups
the
silver
curbs
and
the
brass
rings
flung
here
and
there
luminous
points
in
the
midst
of
the
short
breeches
the
white
gloves
and
the
furs
falling
over
the
blazonry
of
the
carriage
doors
he
felt
as
if
he
were
lost
in
some
world
his
eyes
wandered
along
the
rows
of
female
heads
and
certain
vague
resemblances
brought
back
madame
arnoux
to
his
recollection
he
pictured
her
to
himself
in
the
midst
of
the
others
in
one
of
those
little
broughams
like
madame
brougham
but
the
sun
was
setting
and
the
cold
wind
raised
whirling
clouds
of
dust
the
coachmen
let
their
chins
sink
into
their
neckcloths
the
wheels
began
to
revolve
more
quickly
the
grated
and
all
the
equipages
descended
the
long
sloping
avenue
at
a
quick
trot
touching
sweeping
past
one
another
getting
out
of
one
another
way
then
at
the
place
de
la
concorde
they
went
off
in
different
directions
behind
the
tuileries
there
was
a
patch
of
sky
the
trees
of
the
garden
formed
two
enormous
masses
at
their
summits
the
were
lighted
and
the
seine
green
all
over
was
torn
into
strips
of
silver
moiré
near
the
piers
of
the
bridges
he
went
to
get
a
dinner
for
sous
in
a
restaurant
in
the
rue
de
la
harpe
he
glanced
disdainfully
at
the
old
mahogany
counter
the
soiled
napkins
the
dingy
and
the
hats
hanging
up
on
the
wall
those
around
him
were
students
like
himself
they
talked
about
their
professors
and
about
their
mistresses
much
he
cared
about
professors
had
he
a
mistress
to
avoid
being
a
witness
of
their
enjoyment
he
came
as
late
as
possible
the
tables
were
all
strewn
with
remnants
of
food
the
two
waiters
worn
out
with
attendance
on
customers
lay
asleep
each
in
a
corner
of
his
own
and
an
odour
of
cooking
of
an
argand
lamp
and
of
tobacco
filled
the
deserted
then
he
slowly
toiled
up
the
streets
again
the
gas
lamps
vibrated
casting
on
the
mud
long
yellowish
shafts
of
flickering
light
shadowy
forms
surmounted
by
umbrellas
glided
along
the
footpaths
the
pavement
was
slippery
the
fog
grew
thicker
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
moist
gloom
wrapping
him
around
descended
into
the
depths
of
his
heart
he
was
smitten
with
a
vague
remorse
he
renewed
his
attendance
at
lectures
but
as
he
was
entirely
ignorant
of
the
matters
which
formed
the
subject
of
explanation
things
of
the
simplest
description
puzzled
him
he
set
about
writing
a
novel
entitled
the
the
scene
of
the
story
was
venice
the
hero
was
himself
and
madame
arnoux
was
the
heroine
she
was
called
antonia
and
to
get
possession
of
her
he
assassinated
a
number
of
noblemen
and
burned
a
portion
of
the
city
after
which
achievements
he
sang
a
serenade
under
her
balcony
where
fluttered
in
the
breeze
the
red
damask
curtains
of
the
boulevard
montmartre
the
reminiscences
far
too
numerous
on
which
he
dwelt
produced
a
disheartening
effect
on
him
he
went
no
further
with
the
work
and
his
mental
vacuity
redoubled
after
this
he
begged
of
deslauriers
to
come
and
share
his
apartment
they
might
make
arrangements
to
live
together
with
the
aid
of
his
allowance
of
two
thousand
francs
anything
would
be
better
than
this
intolerable
existence
deslauriers
could
not
yet
leave
troyes
he
urged
his
friend
to
find
some
means
of
distracting
his
thoughts
and
with
that
end
in
view
suggested
that
he
should
call
on
sénécal
sénécal
was
a
mathematical
tutor
a
man
with
republican
convictions
a
future
according
to
the
clerk
frederick
ascended
the
five
flights
up
which
he
lived
three
times
in
succession
without
getting
a
visit
from
him
in
return
he
did
not
go
back
to
the
place
he
now
went
in
for
amusing
himself
he
attended
the
balls
at
the
opera
house
these
exhibitions
of
riotous
gaiety
froze
him
the
moment
he
had
passed
the
door
besides
he
was
restrained
by
the
fear
of
being
subjected
to
insult
on
the
subject
of
money
his
notion
being
that
a
supper
with
a
domino
entailing
considerable
expense
was
rather
a
big
adventure
it
seemed
to
him
however
that
he
must
needs
love
her
sometimes
he
used
to
wake
up
with
his
heart
full
of
hope
dressed
himself
carefully
as
if
he
were
going
to
keep
an
appointment
and
started
on
interminable
excursions
all
over
paris
whenever
a
woman
was
walking
in
front
of
him
or
coming
in
his
direction
he
would
say
here
she
is
every
time
it
was
only
a
fresh
disappointment
the
idea
of
madame
arnoux
strengthened
these
desires
perhaps
he
might
find
her
on
his
way
and
he
conjured
up
dangerous
complications
extraordinary
perils
from
which
he
would
save
her
in
order
to
get
near
her
so
the
days
slipped
by
with
the
same
tiresome
experiences
and
enslavement
to
contracted
habits
he
turned
over
the
pages
of
pamphlets
under
the
arcades
of
the
odéon
went
to
read
the
des
deux
at
the
café
entered
the
hall
of
the
collége
de
france
and
for
an
hour
stopped
to
listen
to
a
lecture
on
chinese
or
political
economy
every
week
he
wrote
long
letters
to
deslauriers
dined
from
time
to
time
with
martinon
and
occasionally
saw
de
cisy
he
hired
a
piano
and
composed
german
waltzes
one
evening
at
the
theatre
of
the
he
perceived
in
one
of
the
arnoux
with
a
woman
by
his
side
was
it
she
the
screen
of
green
taffeta
pulled
over
the
side
of
the
box
hid
her
face
at
length
the
curtain
rose
and
the
screen
was
drawn
aside
she
was
a
tall
woman
of
about
thirty
rather
faded
and
when
she
laughed
her
thick
lips
uncovered
a
row
of
shining
teeth
she
chatted
familiarly
with
arnoux
giving
him
from
time
to
time
taps
with
her
fan
on
the
fingers
then
a
young
girl
with
eyelids
a
little
red
as
if
she
had
just
been
weeping
seated
herself
between
them
arnoux
after
that
remained
stooped
over
her
shoulder
pouring
forth
a
stream
of
talk
to
which
she
listened
without
replying
frederick
taxed
his
ingenuity
to
find
out
the
social
position
of
these
women
modestly
attired
in
gowns
of
sober
hue
with
flat
collars
at
the
close
of
the
play
he
made
a
dash
for
the
passages
the
crowd
of
people
going
out
filled
them
up
arnoux
just
in
front
of
him
was
descending
the
staircase
step
by
step
with
a
woman
on
each
arm
suddenly
a
shed
its
light
on
him
he
wore
a
crape
she
was
dead
perhaps
this
idea
tormented
frederick
mind
so
much
that
he
hurried
next
day
to
the
office
of
and
paying
without
a
moment
delay
for
one
of
the
engravings
exposed
in
the
window
for
sale
he
asked
the
how
was
monsieur
arnoux
the
replied
why
quite
well
frederick
growing
pale
added
and
madame
madame
also
frederick
forgot
to
carry
off
his
engraving
the
winter
drew
to
an
end
he
was
less
melancholy
in
the
spring
time
and
began
to
prepare
for
his
examination
having
passed
it
indifferently
he
started
immediately
afterwards
for
nogent
he
refrained
from
going
to
troyes
to
see
his
friend
in
order
to
escape
his
mother
comments
then
on
his
return
to
paris
at
the
end
of
the
vacation
he
left
his
lodgings
and
took
two
rooms
on
the
quai
napoléon
which
he
furnished
he
had
given
up
all
hope
of
getting
an
invitation
from
the
dambreuses
his
great
passion
for
madame
arnoux
was
beginning
to
die
out
chapter
iv
the
inexpressible
she
one
morning
in
the
month
of
december
while
going
to
attend
a
law
lecture
he
thought
he
could
observe
more
than
ordinary
animation
in
the
rue
the
students
were
rushing
precipitately
out
of
the
cafés
where
through
the
open
windows
they
were
calling
one
another
from
one
house
to
the
other
the
shop
keepers
in
the
middle
of
the
footpath
were
looking
about
them
anxiously
the
were
fastened
and
when
he
reached
the
rue
soufflot
he
perceived
a
large
assemblage
around
the
panthéon
young
men
in
groups
numbering
from
five
to
a
dozen
walked
along
arm
in
arm
and
accosted
the
larger
groups
which
had
stationed
themselves
here
and
there
at
the
lower
end
of
the
square
near
the
railings
men
in
blouses
were
holding
forth
while
policemen
with
their
hats
drawn
over
their
ears
and
their
hands
behind
their
backs
were
strolling
up
and
down
beside
the
walls
making
the
flags
ring
under
the
tread
of
their
heavy
boots
all
wore
a
mysterious
wondering
look
they
were
evidently
expecting
something
to
happen
each
held
back
a
question
which
was
on
the
edge
of
his
lips
frederick
found
himself
close
to
a
young
man
with
a
prepossessing
face
and
a
moustache
and
a
tuft
of
beard
on
his
chin
like
a
dandy
of
louis
xiii
time
he
asked
the
stranger
what
was
the
cause
of
the
disorder
i
have
the
least
idea
replied
the
other
nor
have
they
for
that
matter
is
their
fashion
just
now
what
a
good
joke
and
he
burst
out
laughing
the
petitions
for
reform
which
had
been
signed
at
the
quarters
of
the
national
guard
together
with
the
of
humann
and
other
events
besides
had
for
the
past
six
months
led
to
inexplicable
gatherings
of
riotous
crowds
in
paris
and
so
frequently
had
they
broken
out
anew
that
the
newspapers
had
ceased
to
refer
to
them
this
lacks
graceful
outline
and
colour
continued
neighbour
i
am
convinced
messire
that
we
have
degenerated
in
the
good
epoch
of
louis
and
even
in
that
of
benjamin
constant
there
was
more
mutinousness
amongst
the
students
i
find
them
as
pacific
as
sheep
as
stupid
as
greenhorns
and
only
fit
to
be
grocers
gadzooks
and
these
are
what
we
call
the
youth
of
the
schools
he
held
his
arms
wide
apart
after
the
fashion
of
frederick
lemaitre
in
youth
of
the
schools
i
give
you
my
blessing
after
this
addressing
a
rag
picker
who
was
moving
a
heap
of
up
against
the
wall
of
a
house
do
you
belong
to
them
the
youth
of
the
schools
the
old
man
lifted
up
a
hideous
countenance
in
which
one
could
trace
in
the
midst
of
a
grey
beard
a
red
nose
and
two
dull
eyes
bloodshot
from
drink
no
you
appear
to
me
rather
one
of
those
men
with
patibulary
faces
whom
we
see
in
various
groups
liberally
scattering
gold
oh
scatter
it
my
patriarch
scatter
it
corrupt
me
with
the
treasures
of
albion
are
you
english
i
do
not
reject
the
presents
of
artaxerxes
let
us
have
a
little
chat
about
the
union
of
customs
frederick
felt
a
hand
laid
on
his
shoulder
it
was
martinon
looking
exceedingly
pale
well
said
he
with
a
big
sigh
another
riot
he
was
afraid
of
being
compromised
and
uttered
complaints
men
in
blouses
especially
made
him
feel
uneasy
suggesting
a
connection
with
secret
societies
you
mean
to
say
there
are
secret
societies
said
the
young
man
with
the
moustaches
that
is
a
dodge
of
the
government
to
frighten
the
folk
martinon
urged
him
to
speak
in
a
lower
tone
for
fear
of
the
police
you
believe
still
in
the
police
do
you
as
a
matter
of
fact
how
do
you
know
monsieur
that
i
am
not
myself
a
police
spy
and
he
looked
at
him
in
such
a
way
that
martinon
much
discomposed
was
at
first
unable
to
see
the
joke
the
people
pushed
them
on
and
they
were
all
three
compelled
to
stand
on
the
little
staircase
which
led
by
one
of
the
passages
to
the
new
amphitheatre
the
crowd
soon
broke
up
of
its
own
accord
many
heads
could
be
distinguished
they
bowed
towards
the
distinguished
professor
samuel
rondelot
who
wrapped
in
his
big
with
his
silver
spectacles
held
up
high
in
the
air
and
breathing
hard
from
his
asthma
was
advancing
at
an
easy
pace
on
his
way
to
deliver
his
lecture
this
man
was
one
of
the
judicial
glories
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
rival
of
the
zachariæs
and
the
ruhdorffs
his
new
dignity
of
peer
of
france
had
in
no
way
modified
his
external
demeanour
he
was
known
to
be
poor
and
was
treated
with
profound
respect
meanwhile
at
the
lower
end
of
the
square
some
persons
cried
out
down
with
guizot
down
with
pritchard
down
with
the
sold
ones
down
with
louis
philippe
the
crowd
swayed
to
and
fro
and
pressing
against
the
gate
of
the
courtyard
which
was
shut
prevented
the
professor
from
going
further
he
stopped
in
front
of
the
staircase
he
was
speedily
observed
on
the
lowest
of
three
steps
he
spoke
the
loud
murmurs
of
the
throng
drowned
his
voice
although
at
another
time
they
might
love
him
they
hated
him
now
for
he
was
the
representative
of
authority
every
time
he
tried
to
make
himself
understood
the
outcries
recommenced
he
gesticulated
with
great
energy
to
induce
the
students
to
follow
him
he
was
answered
by
vociferations
from
all
sides
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
disdainfully
and
plunged
into
the
passage
martinon
profited
by
his
situation
to
disappear
at
the
same
moment
what
a
coward
said
frederick
he
was
prudent
returned
the
other
there
was
an
outburst
of
applause
from
the
crowd
from
whose
point
of
view
this
retreat
on
the
part
of
the
professor
appeared
in
the
light
of
a
victory
from
every
window
faces
lighted
with
curiosity
looked
out
some
of
those
in
the
crowd
struck
up
the
marseillaise
others
proposed
to
go
to
béranger
house
to
laffitte
house
to
chateaubriand
house
to
voltaire
house
yelled
the
young
man
with
the
fair
moustaches
the
policemen
tried
to
pass
around
saying
in
the
mildest
tones
they
could
assume
move
on
messieurs
move
on
take
yourselves
off
somebody
exclaimed
down
with
the
slaughterers
this
was
a
form
of
insult
usual
since
the
troubles
of
the
month
of
september
everyone
echoed
it
the
guardians
of
public
order
were
hooted
and
hissed
they
began
to
grow
pale
one
of
them
could
endure
it
no
longer
and
seeing
a
young
man
approaching
too
close
laughing
in
his
teeth
pushed
him
back
so
roughly
that
he
tumbled
over
on
his
back
some
five
paces
away
in
front
of
a
shop
all
made
way
but
almost
immediately
afterwards
the
policeman
rolled
on
the
ground
himself
felled
by
a
blow
from
a
species
of
hercules
whose
hair
hung
down
like
a
bundle
of
tow
under
an
oilskin
cap
having
stopped
for
a
few
minutes
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
he
had
very
quickly
laid
down
a
large
case
which
he
had
been
carrying
in
order
to
make
a
spring
at
the
policeman
and
holding
down
that
functionary
punched
his
face
unmercifully
the
other
policemen
rushed
to
the
rescue
of
their
comrade
the
terrible
was
so
powerfully
built
that
it
took
four
of
them
at
least
to
get
the
better
of
him
two
of
them
shook
him
while
keeping
a
grip
on
his
collar
two
others
dragged
his
arms
a
fifth
gave
him
digs
of
the
knee
in
the
ribs
and
all
of
them
called
him
brigand
assassin
rioter
with
his
breast
bare
and
his
clothes
in
rags
he
protested
that
he
was
innocent
he
could
not
in
cold
blood
look
at
a
child
receiving
a
beating
my
name
is
dussardier
i
employed
at
messieurs
valincart
lace
and
fancy
warehouse
in
the
rue
de
cléry
where
my
case
i
want
my
case
he
kept
repeating
dussardier
rue
de
cléry
my
case
however
he
became
quiet
and
with
a
stoical
air
allowed
himself
to
be
led
towards
the
in
the
rue
descartes
a
flood
of
people
came
rushing
after
him
frederick
and
the
young
man
with
the
moustaches
walked
immediately
behind
full
of
admiration
for
the
shopman
and
indignant
at
the
violence
of
power
as
they
advanced
the
crowd
became
less
thick
the
policemen
from
time
to
time
turned
round
with
threatening
looks
and
the
rowdies
no
longer
having
anything
to
do
and
the
spectators
not
having
anything
to
look
at
all
drifted
away
by
degrees
the
who
met
the
procession
as
they
came
along
stared
at
dussardier
and
in
loud
tones
gave
vent
to
abusive
remarks
about
him
one
old
woman
at
her
own
door
bawled
out
that
he
had
stolen
a
loaf
of
bread
from
her
this
unjust
accusation
increased
the
wrath
of
the
two
friends
at
length
they
reached
the
only
about
twenty
persons
were
now
left
in
the
attenuated
crowd
and
the
sight
of
the
soldiers
was
enough
to
disperse
them
frederick
and
his
companion
boldly
asked
to
have
the
man
who
had
just
been
imprisoned
delivered
up
the
sentinel
threatened
if
they
persisted
to
ram
them
into
jail
too
they
said
they
required
to
see
the
commander
of
the
and
stated
their
names
and
the
fact
that
they
were
declaring
that
the
prisoner
was
one
also
they
were
ushered
into
a
room
perfectly
bare
in
which
amid
an
atmosphere
of
smoke
four
benches
might
be
seen
lining
the
walls
at
the
lower
end
there
was
an
open
wicket
then
appeared
the
sturdy
face
of
dussardier
who
with
his
hair
all
tousled
his
honest
little
eyes
and
his
broad
snout
suggested
to
one
mind
in
a
confused
sort
of
way
the
physiognomy
of
a
good
dog
do
you
recognise
us
said
hussonnet
this
was
the
name
of
the
young
man
with
the
moustaches
why
stammered
dussardier
do
play
the
fool
any
further
returned
the
other
we
know
that
you
are
just
like
ourselves
a
in
spite
of
their
winks
dussardier
failed
to
understand
he
appeared
to
be
collecting
his
thoughts
then
suddenly
has
my
case
been
found
frederick
raised
his
eyes
feeling
much
discouraged
hussonnet
however
said
promptly
ha
your
case
in
which
you
keep
your
notes
of
lectures
yes
yes
make
your
mind
easy
about
it
they
made
further
pantomimic
signs
with
redoubled
energy
till
dussardier
at
last
realised
that
they
had
come
to
help
him
and
he
held
his
tongue
fearing
that
he
might
compromise
them
besides
he
experienced
a
kind
of
shamefacedness
at
seeing
himself
raised
to
the
social
rank
of
student
and
to
an
equality
with
those
young
men
who
had
such
white
hands
do
you
wish
to
send
any
message
to
anyone
asked
frederick
no
thanks
to
nobody
but
your
family
he
lowered
his
head
without
replying
the
poor
fellow
was
a
bastard
the
two
friends
stood
quite
astonished
at
his
silence
have
you
anything
to
smoke
was
frederick
next
question
he
felt
about
then
drew
forth
from
the
depths
of
one
of
his
pockets
the
remains
of
a
pipe
a
beautiful
pipe
made
of
white
talc
with
a
shank
of
blackwood
a
silver
cover
and
an
amber
mouthpiece
for
the
last
three
years
he
had
been
engaged
in
completing
this
masterpiece
he
had
been
careful
to
keep
the
bowl
of
it
constantly
thrust
into
a
kind
of
sheath
of
chamois
to
smoke
it
as
slowly
as
possible
without
ever
letting
it
lie
on
any
cold
stone
substance
and
to
hang
it
up
every
evening
over
the
head
of
his
bed
and
now
he
shook
out
the
fragments
of
it
into
his
hand
the
nails
of
which
were
covered
with
blood
and
with
his
chin
sunk
on
his
chest
his
pupils
fixed
and
dilated
he
contemplated
this
wreck
of
the
thing
that
had
yielded
him
such
delight
with
a
glance
of
unutterable
sadness
suppose
we
give
him
some
cigars
eh
said
hussonnet
in
a
whisper
making
a
gesture
as
if
he
were
reaching
them
out
frederick
had
already
laid
down
a
filled
on
the
edge
of
the
wicket
pray
take
this
cheer
up
dussardier
flung
himself
on
the
two
hands
that
were
held
out
towards
him
he
pressed
them
frantically
his
voice
choked
with
sobs
what
for
me
for
me
the
two
friends
tore
themselves
away
from
the
effusive
display
of
gratitude
which
he
made
and
went
off
to
lunch
together
at
the
café
tabourey
in
front
of
the
luxembourg
while
cutting
up
the
beefsteak
hussonnet
informed
his
companion
that
he
did
work
for
the
fashion
journals
and
manufactured
catchwords
for
at
jacques
arnoux
establishment
said
frederick
do
you
know
him
yes
no
that
is
to
say
i
have
seen
him
i
have
met
him
he
carelessly
asked
hussonnet
if
he
sometimes
saw
arnoux
wife
from
time
to
time
the
bohemian
replied
frederick
did
not
venture
to
follow
up
his
enquiries
this
man
henceforth
would
fill
up
a
large
space
in
his
life
he
paid
the
without
any
protest
on
the
other
part
there
was
a
bond
of
mutual
sympathy
between
them
they
gave
one
another
their
respective
addresses
and
hussonnet
cordially
invited
frederick
to
accompany
him
to
the
rue
de
fleurus
they
had
reached
the
middle
of
the
garden
when
arnoux
clerk
holding
his
breath
twisted
his
features
into
a
hideous
grimace
and
began
to
crow
like
a
cock
thereupon
all
the
cocks
in
the
vicinity
responded
with
prolonged
it
is
a
signal
explained
hussonnet
they
stopped
close
to
the
théàtre
bobino
in
front
of
a
house
to
which
they
had
to
find
their
way
through
an
alley
in
the
skylight
of
a
garret
between
the
nasturtiums
and
the
sweet
peas
a
young
woman
showed
herself
in
her
stays
her
two
arms
resting
on
the
edge
of
the
my
angel
ducky
said
hussonnet
sending
her
kisses
he
made
the
barrier
fly
open
with
a
kick
and
disappeared
frederick
waited
for
him
all
the
week
he
did
not
venture
to
call
at
hussonnet
residence
lest
it
might
look
as
if
he
were
in
a
hurry
to
get
a
lunch
in
return
for
the
one
he
had
paid
for
but
he
sought
the
clerk
all
over
the
latin
quarter
he
came
across
him
one
evening
and
brought
him
to
his
apartment
on
the
quai
napoléon
they
had
a
long
chat
and
unbosomed
themselves
to
each
other
hussonnet
yearned
after
the
glory
and
the
gains
of
the
theatre
he
collaborated
in
the
writing
of
vaudevilles
which
were
not
accepted
had
heaps
of
plans
could
turn
a
couplet
he
sang
out
for
frederick
a
few
of
the
verses
he
had
composed
then
noticing
on
one
of
the
shelves
a
volume
of
hugo
and
another
of
lamartine
he
broke
out
into
sarcastic
criticisms
of
the
romantic
school
these
poets
had
neither
good
sense
nor
correctness
and
above
all
were
not
french
he
plumed
himself
on
his
knowledge
of
the
language
and
analysed
the
most
beautiful
phrases
with
that
snarling
severity
that
academic
taste
which
persons
of
playful
disposition
exhibit
when
they
are
discussing
serious
art
frederick
was
wounded
in
his
predilections
and
he
felt
a
desire
to
cut
the
discussion
short
why
not
take
the
risk
at
once
of
uttering
the
word
on
which
his
happiness
depended
he
asked
this
literary
youth
whether
it
would
be
possible
to
get
an
introduction
into
the
arnoux
house
through
his
agency
the
thing
was
declared
to
be
quite
easy
and
they
fixed
upon
the
following
day
hussonnet
failed
to
keep
the
appointment
and
on
three
subsequent
occasions
he
did
not
turn
up
one
saturday
about
four
he
made
his
appearance
but
taking
advantage
of
the
cab
into
which
they
had
got
he
drew
up
in
front
of
the
théàtre
français
to
get
a
got
down
at
a
tailor
shop
then
at
a
dressmaker
and
wrote
notes
in
the
lodge
at
last
they
came
to
the
boulevard
montmartre
frederick
passed
through
the
shop
and
went
up
the
staircase
arnoux
recognised
him
through
the
in
front
of
his
desk
and
while
continuing
to
write
he
stretched
out
his
hand
and
laid
it
on
frederick
shoulder
five
or
six
persons
standing
up
filled
the
narrow
apartment
which
was
lighted
by
a
single
window
looking
out
on
the
yard
a
sofa
of
brown
damask
wool
occupying
the
interior
of
an
alcove
between
two
of
similar
material
upon
the
covered
with
old
papers
there
was
a
bronze
venus
two
candelabra
garnished
with
supported
it
one
at
each
side
at
the
right
near
a
cardboard
chest
of
drawers
a
man
seated
in
an
armchair
was
reading
the
newspaper
with
his
hat
on
the
walls
were
hidden
from
view
beneath
the
array
of
prints
and
pictures
precious
engravings
or
sketches
by
contemporary
masters
adorned
with
dedications
testifying
the
most
sincere
affection
for
jacques
arnoux
you
getting
on
well
all
this
time
said
he
turning
round
to
frederick
and
without
waiting
for
an
answer
he
asked
hussonnet
in
a
low
tone
what
is
your
friend
name
then
raising
his
voice
take
a
cigar
out
of
the
box
on
the
cardboard
stand
the
office
of
situated
in
a
central
position
in
paris
was
a
convenient
place
of
resort
a
neutral
ground
wherein
rivalries
elbowed
each
other
familiarly
on
this
day
might
be
seen
there
anténor
braive
who
painted
portraits
of
kings
jules
burrieu
who
by
his
sketches
was
beginning
to
popularise
the
wars
in
algeria
the
caricaturist
sombary
the
sculptor
vourdat
and
others
and
not
a
single
one
of
them
corresponded
with
the
student
preconceived
ideas
their
manners
were
simple
their
talk
free
and
easy
the
mystic
lovarias
told
an
obscene
story
and
the
inventor
of
oriental
landscape
the
famous
dittmer
wore
a
knitted
shirt
under
his
waistcoat
and
went
home
in
the
omnibus
the
first
topic
that
came
on
the
carpet
was
the
case
of
a
girl
named
apollonie
formerly
a
model
whom
burrieu
alleged
that
he
had
seen
on
the
boulevard
in
a
carriage
hussonnet
explained
this
metamorphosis
through
the
succession
of
persons
who
had
loved
her
how
well
this
sly
dog
knows
the
girls
of
paris
said
arnoux
after
you
if
there
are
any
of
them
left
sire
replied
the
bohemian
with
a
military
salute
in
imitation
of
the
grenadier
offering
his
flask
to
napoléon
then
they
talked
about
some
pictures
in
which
apollonie
had
sat
for
the
female
figures
they
criticised
their
absent
brethren
expressing
astonishment
at
the
sums
paid
for
their
works
and
they
were
all
complaining
of
not
having
been
sufficiently
remunerated
themselves
when
the
conversation
was
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
a
man
of
middle
stature
who
had
his
coat
fastened
by
a
single
button
and
whose
eyes
glittered
with
a
rather
wild
expression
what
a
lot
of
shopkeepers
you
are
said
he
god
bless
my
soul
what
does
that
signify
the
old
masters
did
not
trouble
their
heads
about
the
million
correggio
murillo
add
pellerin
said
sombary
but
without
taking
the
slightest
notice
of
the
epigram
he
went
on
talking
with
such
vehemence
that
arnoux
was
forced
to
repeat
twice
to
him
my
wife
wants
you
on
thursday
do
forget
this
remark
recalled
madame
arnoux
to
frederick
thoughts
no
doubt
one
might
be
able
to
reach
her
through
the
little
room
near
the
sofa
arnoux
had
just
opened
the
portière
leading
into
it
to
get
a
and
frédéric
had
seen
a
at
the
far
end
of
the
apartment
but
at
this
point
a
kind
of
muttering
sound
came
from
the
corner
of
the
it
was
caused
by
the
personage
who
sat
in
the
armchair
reading
the
newspaper
he
was
a
man
of
five
feet
nine
inches
in
height
with
rather
heavy
eyelashes
a
head
of
grey
hair
and
an
imposing
appearance
and
his
name
was
regimbart
what
the
matter
now
citizen
said
arnoux
another
fresh
piece
of
rascality
on
the
part
of
government
the
thing
that
he
was
referring
to
was
the
dismissal
of
a
schoolmaster
pellerin
again
took
up
his
parallel
between
michael
angelo
and
shakespeare
dittmer
was
taking
himself
off
when
arnoux
pulled
him
back
in
order
to
put
two
bank
notes
into
his
hand
thereupon
hussonnet
said
considering
this
an
opportune
time
could
you
give
me
an
advance
my
dear
master
but
arnoux
had
resumed
his
seat
and
was
administering
a
severe
reprimand
to
an
old
man
of
mean
aspect
who
wore
a
pair
of
blue
spectacles
ha
a
nice
fellow
you
are
père
isaac
here
are
three
works
cried
down
destroyed
everybody
is
laughing
at
me
people
know
what
they
are
now
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
with
them
i
have
to
send
them
off
to
california
or
to
the
devil
hold
your
tongue
the
specialty
of
this
old
worthy
consisted
in
attaching
the
signatures
of
the
great
masters
at
the
bottom
of
these
pictures
arnoux
refused
to
pay
him
and
dismissed
him
in
a
brutal
fashion
then
with
an
entire
change
of
manner
he
bowed
to
a
gentleman
of
affectedly
grave
demeanour
who
wore
whiskers
and
displayed
a
white
tie
round
his
neck
and
the
cross
of
the
legion
of
honour
over
his
breast
with
his
elbow
resting
on
the
he
kept
talking
to
him
for
a
long
time
in
honeyed
tones
at
last
he
burst
out
ah
well
i
am
not
bothered
with
brokers
count
the
nobleman
gave
way
and
arnoux
paid
him
down
louis
as
soon
as
he
had
gone
out
what
a
plague
these
big
lords
are
a
lot
of
wretches
muttered
regimbart
as
it
grew
later
arnoux
was
much
more
busily
occupied
he
classified
articles
tore
open
letters
set
out
accounts
in
a
row
at
the
sound
of
hammering
in
the
warehouse
he
went
out
to
look
after
the
packing
then
he
went
back
to
his
ordinary
work
and
while
he
kept
his
steel
pen
running
over
the
paper
he
indulged
in
sharp
witticisms
he
had
an
invitation
to
dine
with
his
lawyer
that
evening
and
was
starting
next
day
for
belgium
the
others
chatted
about
the
topics
of
the
day
cherubini
portrait
the
hemicycle
of
the
fine
arts
and
the
next
exhibition
pellerin
railed
at
the
institute
scandalous
stories
and
serious
discussions
got
mixed
up
together
the
apartment
with
its
low
ceiling
was
so
much
stuffed
up
that
one
could
scarcely
move
and
the
light
of
the
was
obscured
in
the
smoke
of
their
cigars
like
the
rays
in
a
fog
the
door
near
the
sofa
flew
open
and
a
tall
thin
woman
entered
with
abrupt
movements
which
made
all
the
trinkets
of
her
watch
rattle
under
her
black
taffeta
gown
it
was
the
woman
of
whom
frederick
had
caught
a
glimpse
last
summer
at
the
some
of
those
present
addressing
her
by
name
shook
hands
with
her
hussonnet
had
at
last
managed
to
extract
from
his
employer
the
sum
of
fifty
francs
the
clock
struck
seven
all
rose
to
go
arnoux
told
pellerin
to
remain
and
accompanied
mademoiselle
vatnaz
into
the
frederick
could
not
hear
what
they
said
they
spoke
in
whispers
however
the
woman
voice
was
raised
i
have
been
waiting
ever
since
the
job
was
done
six
months
ago
there
was
a
long
silence
and
then
mademoiselle
vatnaz
reappeared
arnoux
had
again
promised
her
something
oh
oh
later
we
shall
see
happy
man
said
she
as
she
was
going
out
arnoux
quickly
the
rubbed
some
cosmetic
over
his
moustaches
raised
his
braces
stretched
his
straps
and
while
he
was
washing
his
hands
i
would
require
two
over
the
door
at
two
hundred
and
fifty
apiece
in
boucher
style
is
that
understood
be
it
so
said
the
artist
his
face
reddening
good
and
do
forget
my
wife
frederick
accompanied
pellerin
to
the
top
of
the
faubourg
poissonnière
and
asked
his
permission
to
come
to
see
him
sometimes
a
favour
which
was
graciously
accorded
pellerin
read
every
work
on
æsthetics
in
order
to
find
out
the
true
theory
of
the
beautiful
convinced
that
when
he
had
discovered
it
he
would
produce
masterpieces
he
surrounded
himself
with
every
imaginable
auxiliary
drawings
models
engravings
and
he
kept
searching
about
eating
his
heart
out
he
blamed
the
weather
his
nerves
his
studio
went
out
into
the
street
to
find
inspiration
there
quivered
with
delight
at
the
thought
that
he
had
caught
it
then
abandoned
the
work
in
which
he
was
engaged
and
dreamed
of
another
which
should
be
finer
thus
tormented
by
the
desire
for
glory
and
wasting
his
days
in
discussions
believing
in
a
thousand
fooleries
in
systems
in
criticisms
in
the
importance
of
a
regulation
or
a
reform
in
the
domain
of
art
he
had
at
fifty
as
yet
turned
out
nothing
save
mere
sketches
his
robust
pride
prevented
him
from
experiencing
any
discouragement
but
he
was
always
irritated
and
in
that
state
of
exaltation
at
the
same
time
factitious
and
natural
which
is
characteristic
of
comedians
on
entering
his
studio
one
attention
was
directed
towards
two
large
pictures
in
which
the
first
tones
of
colour
laid
on
here
and
there
made
on
the
white
canvas
spots
of
brown
red
and
blue
a
network
of
lines
in
chalk
stretched
overhead
like
stitches
of
thread
repeated
twenty
times
it
was
impossible
to
understand
what
it
meant
pellerin
explained
the
subject
of
these
two
compositions
by
pointing
out
with
his
thumb
the
portions
that
were
lacking
the
first
was
intended
to
represent
the
madness
of
nebuchadnezzar
and
the
second
the
burning
of
rome
by
nero
frederick
admired
them
he
admired
academies
of
women
with
dishevelled
hair
landscapes
in
which
trunks
of
trees
twisted
by
the
storm
abounded
and
above
all
freaks
of
the
pen
imitations
from
memory
of
callot
rembrandt
or
goya
of
which
he
did
not
know
the
models
pellerin
no
longer
set
any
value
on
these
works
of
his
youth
he
was
now
all
in
favour
of
the
grand
style
he
dogmatised
eloquently
about
phidias
and
winckelmann
the
objects
around
him
strengthened
the
force
of
his
language
one
saw
a
death
head
on
a
yataghans
a
monk
habit
frederick
put
it
on
when
he
arrived
early
he
surprised
the
artist
in
his
wretched
which
was
hidden
from
view
by
a
strip
of
tapestry
for
pellerin
went
to
bed
late
being
an
assiduous
frequenter
of
the
theatres
an
old
woman
in
tatters
attended
on
him
he
dined
at
a
and
lived
without
a
mistress
his
acquirements
picked
up
in
the
most
irregular
fashion
rendered
his
paradoxes
amusing
his
hatred
of
the
vulgar
and
the
bourgeois
overflowed
in
sarcasms
marked
by
a
superb
lyricism
and
he
had
such
religious
reverence
for
the
masters
that
it
raised
him
almost
to
their
level
but
why
had
he
never
spoken
about
madame
arnoux
as
for
her
son
at
one
time
he
called
pellerin
a
decent
fellow
at
other
times
a
charlatan
frederick
was
waiting
for
some
disclosures
on
his
part
one
day
while
turning
over
one
of
the
portfolios
in
the
studio
he
thought
he
could
trace
in
the
portrait
of
a
female
bohemian
some
resemblance
to
mademoiselle
vatnaz
and
as
he
felt
interested
in
this
lady
he
desired
to
know
what
was
her
exact
social
position
she
had
been
as
far
as
pellerin
could
ascertain
originally
a
schoolmistress
in
the
provinces
she
now
gave
lessons
in
paris
and
tried
to
write
for
the
small
journals
according
to
frederick
one
would
imagine
from
her
manners
with
arnoux
that
she
was
his
mistress
pshaw
he
has
others
then
turning
away
his
face
which
reddened
with
shame
as
he
realised
the
baseness
of
the
suggestion
the
young
man
added
with
a
swaggering
air
very
likely
his
wife
pays
him
back
for
it
not
at
all
she
is
virtuous
frederick
again
experienced
a
feeling
of
compunction
and
the
result
was
that
his
attendance
at
the
office
of
the
art
journal
became
more
marked
than
before
the
big
letters
which
formed
the
name
of
arnoux
on
the
marble
plate
above
the
shop
seemed
to
him
quite
peculiar
and
pregnant
with
significance
like
some
sacred
writing
the
wide
footpath
by
its
descent
facilitated
his
approach
the
door
almost
turned
of
its
own
accord
and
the
handle
smooth
to
the
touch
gave
him
the
sensation
of
friendly
and
as
it
were
intelligent
fingers
clasping
his
unconsciously
he
became
quite
as
punctual
as
regimbart
every
day
regimbart
seated
himself
in
the
chimney
corner
in
his
armchair
got
hold
of
the
and
kept
possession
of
it
expressing
his
thoughts
by
exclamations
or
by
shrugs
of
the
shoulders
from
time
to
time
he
would
wipe
his
forehead
with
his
rolled
up
in
a
ball
which
he
usually
stuck
in
between
two
buttons
of
his
green
he
had
trousers
with
wrinkles
bluchers
and
a
long
cravat
and
his
hat
with
its
brim
made
him
easily
recognised
at
a
distance
in
a
crowd
at
eight
in
the
morning
he
descended
the
heights
of
montmartre
in
order
to
imbibe
white
wine
in
the
rue
nôtre
dame
des
victoires
a
late
breakfast
following
several
games
of
billiards
brought
him
on
to
three
he
then
directed
his
steps
towards
the
passage
des
panoramas
where
he
had
a
glass
of
absinthe
after
the
sitting
in
arnoux
shop
he
entered
the
bordelais
where
he
swallowed
some
bitters
then
in
place
of
returning
home
to
his
wife
he
preferred
to
dine
alone
in
a
little
café
in
the
rue
gaillon
where
he
desired
them
to
serve
up
to
him
household
dishes
natural
things
finally
he
made
his
way
to
another
and
remained
there
till
midnight
in
fact
till
one
in
the
morning
up
till
the
last
moment
when
the
gas
being
put
out
and
the
fastened
the
master
of
the
establishment
worn
out
begged
of
him
to
go
and
it
was
not
the
love
of
drinking
that
attracted
citizen
regimbart
to
these
places
but
the
inveterate
habit
of
talking
politics
at
such
resorts
with
advancing
age
he
had
lost
his
vivacity
and
now
exhibited
only
a
silent
moroseness
one
would
have
said
judging
from
the
gravity
of
his
countenence
that
he
was
turning
over
in
his
mind
the
affairs
of
the
whole
world
nothing
however
came
from
it
and
nobody
even
amongst
his
own
friends
knew
him
to
have
any
occupation
although
he
gave
himself
out
as
being
up
to
his
eyes
in
business
arnoux
appeared
to
have
a
very
great
esteem
for
him
one
day
he
said
to
frederick
he
knows
a
lot
i
assure
you
he
is
an
able
man
on
another
occasion
regimbart
spread
over
his
desk
papers
relating
to
the
kaolin
mines
in
brittany
arnoux
referred
to
his
own
experience
on
the
subject
frederick
showed
himself
more
ceremonious
towards
regimbart
going
so
far
as
to
invite
him
from
time
to
time
to
take
a
glass
of
absinthe
and
although
he
considered
him
a
stupid
man
he
often
remained
a
full
hour
in
his
company
solely
because
he
was
jacques
arnoux
friend
after
pushing
forward
some
contemporary
masters
in
the
early
portions
of
their
career
the
a
man
of
progressive
ideas
had
tried
while
clinging
to
his
artistic
ways
to
extend
his
pecuniary
profits
his
object
was
to
emancipate
the
fine
arts
to
get
the
sublime
at
a
cheap
rate
over
every
industry
associated
with
parisian
luxury
he
exercised
an
influence
which
proved
fortunate
with
respect
to
little
things
but
fatal
with
respect
to
great
things
with
his
mania
for
pandering
to
public
opinion
he
made
clever
artists
swerve
from
their
true
path
corrupted
the
strong
exhausted
the
weak
and
got
distinction
for
those
of
mediocre
talent
he
set
them
up
with
the
assistance
of
his
connections
and
of
his
magazine
tyros
in
painting
were
ambitious
of
seeing
their
works
in
his
and
upholsterers
brought
specimens
of
furniture
to
his
house
frederick
regarded
him
at
the
same
time
as
a
millionaire
as
a
and
as
a
man
of
action
however
he
found
many
things
that
filled
him
with
astonishment
for
my
lord
arnoux
was
rather
sly
in
his
commercial
transactions
he
received
from
the
very
heart
of
germany
or
of
italy
a
picture
purchased
in
paris
for
fifteen
hundred
francs
and
exhibiting
an
invoice
that
brought
the
price
up
to
four
thousand
sold
it
over
again
through
complaisance
for
three
thousand
five
hundred
one
of
his
usual
tricks
with
painters
was
to
exact
as
a
an
abatement
in
the
of
their
pictures
under
the
pretence
that
he
would
bring
out
an
engraving
of
it
he
always
when
selling
such
pictures
made
a
profit
by
the
abatement
but
the
engraving
never
appeared
to
those
who
complained
that
he
had
taken
an
advantage
of
them
he
would
reply
by
a
slap
on
the
stomach
generous
in
other
ways
he
squandered
money
on
cigars
for
his
acquaintances
thee
and
thou
persons
who
were
unknown
displayed
enthusiasm
about
a
work
or
a
man
and
after
that
sticking
to
his
opinion
and
regardless
of
consequences
spared
no
expense
in
journeys
correspondence
and
advertising
he
looked
upon
himself
as
very
upright
and
yielding
to
an
irresistible
impulse
to
unbosom
himself
ingenuously
told
his
friends
about
certain
indelicate
acts
of
which
he
had
been
guilty
once
in
order
to
annoy
a
member
of
his
own
trade
who
inaugurated
another
art
journal
with
a
big
banquet
he
asked
frederick
to
write
under
his
own
eyes
a
little
before
the
hour
fixed
for
the
entertainment
letters
to
the
guests
recalling
the
invitations
this
impugns
nobody
honour
do
you
understand
and
the
young
man
did
not
dare
to
refuse
the
service
next
day
on
entering
with
hussonnet
arnoux
office
frederick
saw
through
the
door
the
one
opening
on
the
staircase
the
hem
of
a
dress
disappearing
a
thousand
pardons
said
hussonnet
if
i
had
known
that
there
were
women
oh
as
for
that
one
she
is
my
own
replied
arnoux
she
just
came
in
to
pay
me
a
visit
as
she
was
passing
you
do
say
so
said
frederick
why
yes
she
is
going
back
home
again
the
charm
of
the
things
around
him
was
suddenly
withdrawn
that
which
had
seemed
to
him
to
be
diffused
vaguely
through
the
place
had
now
vanished
or
rather
it
had
never
been
there
he
experienced
an
infinite
amazement
and
as
it
were
the
painful
sensation
of
having
been
betrayed
arnoux
while
rummaging
about
in
his
drawer
began
to
smile
was
he
laughing
at
him
the
clerk
laid
down
a
bundle
of
moist
papers
on
the
table
ha
the
placards
exclaimed
the
i
am
not
ready
to
dine
this
evening
regimbart
took
up
his
hat
what
are
you
leaving
me
seven
said
regimbart
frederick
followed
him
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
montmartre
he
turned
round
he
glanced
towards
the
windows
of
the
first
floor
and
he
laughed
internally
with
as
he
recalled
to
mind
with
what
love
he
had
so
often
contemplated
them
where
then
did
she
reside
how
was
he
to
meet
her
now
once
more
around
the
object
of
his
desire
a
solitude
opened
more
immense
than
ever
are
you
coming
to
take
it
asked
regimbart
to
take
what
the
absinthe
and
yielding
to
his
importunities
frederick
allowed
himself
to
be
led
towards
the
bordelais
whilst
his
companion
leaning
on
his
elbow
was
staring
at
the
decanter
he
was
turning
his
eyes
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
but
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
pellerin
profile
on
the
footpath
outside
the
painter
gave
a
quick
tap
at
the
and
he
had
scarcely
sat
down
when
regimbart
asked
him
why
they
no
longer
saw
him
at
the
office
of
may
i
perish
before
ever
i
go
back
there
again
the
fellow
is
a
brute
a
mere
tradesman
a
wretch
a
downright
rogue
these
insulting
words
harmonised
with
frederick
present
angry
mood
nevertheless
he
was
wounded
for
it
seemed
to
him
that
they
hit
at
madame
arnoux
more
or
less
why
what
has
he
done
to
you
said
regimbart
pellerin
stamped
with
his
foot
on
the
ground
and
his
only
response
was
an
energetic
puff
he
had
been
devoting
himself
to
artistic
work
of
a
kind
that
he
did
not
care
to
connect
his
name
with
such
as
portraits
for
two
crayons
or
pasticcios
from
the
great
masters
for
amateurs
of
limited
knowledge
and
as
he
felt
humiliated
by
these
inferior
productions
he
preferred
to
hold
his
tongue
on
the
subject
as
a
general
rule
but
arnoux
dirty
conduct
exasperated
him
too
much
he
had
to
relieve
his
feelings
in
accordance
with
an
order
which
had
been
given
in
frederick
very
presence
he
had
brought
arnoux
two
pictures
thereupon
the
dealer
took
the
liberty
of
criticising
them
he
found
fault
with
the
composition
the
colouring
and
the
drawing
above
all
the
drawing
he
would
not
in
short
take
them
at
any
price
but
driven
to
extremities
by
a
bill
falling
due
pellerin
had
to
give
them
to
the
jew
isaac
and
a
fortnight
later
arnoux
himself
sold
them
to
a
spaniard
for
two
thousand
francs
not
a
sou
less
what
rascality
and
faith
he
has
done
many
other
things
just
as
bad
one
of
these
mornings
we
see
him
in
the
dock
how
you
exaggerate
said
frederick
in
a
timid
voice
come
now
that
good
i
exaggerate
exclaimed
the
artist
giving
the
table
a
great
blow
with
his
fist
this
violence
had
the
effect
of
completely
restoring
the
young
no
doubt
he
might
have
acted
more
nicely
still
if
arnoux
found
these
two
pictures
bad
say
it
out
are
you
a
judge
of
them
is
this
your
profession
now
you
know
my
youngster
i
do
allow
this
sort
of
thing
on
the
part
of
mere
amateurs
ah
well
it
not
my
business
said
frederick
then
what
interest
have
you
in
defending
him
returned
pellerin
coldly
the
young
man
faltered
but
since
i
am
his
friend
go
and
give
him
a
hug
for
me
good
evening
and
the
painter
rushed
away
in
a
rage
and
of
course
without
paying
for
his
drink
frederick
whilst
defending
arnoux
had
convinced
himself
in
the
heat
of
his
eloquence
he
was
filled
with
tenderness
towards
this
man
so
intelligent
and
kind
whom
his
friends
calumniated
and
who
had
now
to
work
all
alone
abandoned
by
them
he
could
not
resist
a
strange
impulse
to
go
at
once
and
see
him
again
ten
minutes
afterwards
he
pushed
open
the
door
of
the
arnoux
was
preparing
with
the
assistance
of
his
clerks
some
huge
placards
for
an
exhibition
of
pictures
halloa
what
brings
you
back
again
this
question
simple
though
it
was
embarrassed
frederick
and
at
a
loss
for
an
answer
he
asked
whether
they
had
happened
to
find
a
notebook
of
his
a
little
notebook
with
a
blue
leather
cover
the
one
that
you
put
your
letters
to
women
in
said
arnoux
frederick
blushing
like
a
young
girl
protested
against
such
an
assumption
your
verses
then
returned
the
he
handled
the
pictorial
specimens
that
were
to
be
exhibited
discovering
their
form
colouring
and
frames
and
frederick
felt
more
and
more
irritated
by
his
air
of
abstraction
and
particularly
by
the
appearance
of
his
hands
large
hands
rather
soft
with
flat
nails
at
length
arnoux
arose
and
saying
that
disposed
of
he
chucked
the
young
man
familiarly
under
the
chin
frederick
was
offended
at
this
liberty
and
recoiled
a
pace
or
two
then
he
made
a
dash
for
the
and
passed
out
through
it
as
he
imagined
for
the
last
time
in
his
life
madame
arnoux
herself
had
been
lowered
by
the
vulgarity
of
her
husband
during
the
same
week
he
got
a
letter
from
deslauriers
informing
him
that
the
clerk
would
be
in
paris
on
the
following
thursday
then
he
flung
himself
back
violently
on
this
affection
as
one
of
a
more
solid
and
lofty
character
a
man
of
this
sort
was
worth
all
the
women
in
the
world
he
would
no
longer
have
any
need
of
regimbart
of
pellerin
of
hussonnet
of
anyone
in
order
to
provide
his
friend
with
as
comfortable
lodgings
as
possible
he
bought
an
iron
bedstead
and
a
second
armchair
and
stripped
off
some
of
his
own
to
garnish
this
one
properly
on
thursday
morning
he
was
dressing
himself
to
go
to
meet
deslauriers
when
there
was
a
ring
at
the
door
arnoux
entered
just
one
word
yesterday
i
got
a
lovely
trout
from
geneva
we
expect
you
at
seven
sharp
the
address
is
the
rue
de
choiseul
do
forget
frederick
was
obliged
to
sit
down
his
knees
were
tottering
under
him
he
repeated
to
himself
at
last
at
last
then
he
wrote
to
his
tailor
to
his
hatter
and
to
his
bootmaker
and
he
despatched
these
three
notes
by
three
different
messengers
the
key
turned
in
the
lock
and
the
appeared
with
a
trunk
on
his
shoulder
frederick
on
seeing
deslauriers
began
to
tremble
like
an
adulteress
under
the
glance
of
her
husband
what
has
happened
to
you
said
deslauriers
surely
you
got
my
letter
frederick
had
not
enough
energy
left
to
lie
he
opened
his
arms
and
flung
himself
on
his
friend
breast
then
the
clerk
told
his
story
his
father
thought
to
avoid
giving
an
account
of
the
expense
of
tutelage
fancying
that
the
period
limited
for
rendering
such
accounts
was
ten
years
but
well
up
in
legal
procedure
deslauriers
had
managed
to
get
the
share
coming
to
him
from
his
mother
into
his
clutches
seven
thousand
francs
clear
which
he
had
there
with
him
in
an
old
is
a
reserve
fund
in
case
of
misfortune
i
must
think
over
the
best
way
of
investing
it
and
find
quarters
for
myself
morning
i
perfectly
free
and
am
entirely
at
your
service
my
old
friend
oh
do
put
yourself
about
said
frederick
if
you
had
anything
of
importance
to
do
this
evening
come
now
i
would
be
a
selfish
wretch
this
epithet
flung
out
at
random
touched
frederick
to
the
quick
like
a
reproachful
hint
the
had
placed
on
the
table
close
to
the
fire
some
chops
cold
meat
a
large
lobster
some
sweets
for
dessert
and
two
bottles
of
bordeaux
deslauriers
was
touched
by
these
excellent
preparations
to
welcome
his
arrival
upon
my
word
you
are
treating
me
like
a
king
they
talked
about
their
past
and
about
the
future
and
from
time
to
time
they
grasped
each
other
hands
across
the
table
gazing
at
each
other
tenderly
for
a
moment
but
a
messenger
came
with
a
new
hat
deslauriers
in
a
loud
tone
remarked
that
this
was
very
showy
next
came
the
tailor
himself
to
fit
on
the
coat
to
which
he
had
given
a
touch
with
the
one
would
imagine
you
were
going
to
be
married
said
deslauriers
an
hour
later
a
third
individual
appeared
on
the
scene
and
drew
forth
from
a
big
black
bag
a
pair
of
shining
patent
leather
boots
while
frederick
was
trying
them
on
the
bootmaker
slyly
drew
attention
to
the
shoes
of
the
young
man
from
the
country
does
monsieur
require
anything
thanks
replied
the
clerk
pulling
behind
his
chair
his
old
shoes
fastened
with
strings
this
humiliating
incident
annoyed
frederick
at
length
he
exclaimed
as
if
an
idea
had
suddenly
taken
possession
of
him
ha
deuce
take
it
i
was
forgetting
what
is
it
pray
i
have
to
dine
in
the
city
this
evening
at
the
dambreuses
why
did
you
never
say
anything
to
me
about
them
in
your
letters
it
is
not
at
the
dambreuses
but
at
the
arnoux
you
should
have
let
me
know
beforehand
said
deslauriers
i
would
have
come
a
day
later
impossible
returned
frederick
abruptly
i
only
got
the
invitation
this
morning
a
little
while
ago
and
to
redeem
his
error
and
distract
his
friend
mind
from
the
occurrence
he
proceeded
to
unfasten
the
tangled
cords
round
the
trunk
and
to
arrange
all
his
belongings
in
the
chest
of
drawers
expressed
his
willingness
to
give
him
his
own
bed
and
offered
to
sleep
himself
in
the
bedstead
then
as
soon
as
it
was
four
he
began
the
preparations
for
his
toilet
you
have
plenty
of
time
said
the
other
at
last
he
was
dressed
and
off
he
went
that
the
way
with
the
rich
thought
deslauriers
and
he
went
to
dine
in
the
rue
at
a
little
restaurant
kept
by
a
man
he
knew
frederick
stopped
several
times
while
going
up
the
stairs
so
violently
did
his
heart
beat
one
of
his
gloves
which
was
too
tight
burst
and
while
he
was
fastening
back
the
torn
part
under
his
arnoux
who
was
mounting
the
stairs
behind
him
took
his
arm
and
led
him
in
the
anteroom
decorated
in
the
chinese
fashion
had
a
painted
lantern
hanging
from
the
ceiling
and
bamboos
in
the
corners
as
he
was
passing
into
the
frederick
stumbled
against
a
tiger
skin
the
place
had
not
yet
been
lighted
up
but
two
lamps
were
burning
in
the
boudoir
in
the
far
corner
mademoiselle
marthe
came
to
announce
that
her
mamma
was
dressing
arnoux
raised
her
as
high
as
his
mouth
in
order
to
kiss
her
then
as
he
wished
to
go
to
the
cellar
himself
to
select
certain
bottles
of
wine
he
left
frederick
with
the
little
girl
she
had
grown
much
larger
since
the
trip
in
the
steamboat
her
dark
hair
descended
in
long
ringlets
which
curled
over
her
bare
arms
her
dress
more
puffed
out
than
the
petticoat
of
a
allowed
her
rosy
calves
to
be
seen
and
her
pretty
childlike
form
had
all
the
fresh
odour
of
a
bunch
of
flowers
she
received
the
young
gentleman
compliments
with
a
coquettish
air
fixed
on
him
her
large
dreamy
eyes
then
slipping
on
the
carpet
amid
the
furniture
disappeared
like
a
cat
after
this
he
no
longer
felt
ill
at
ease
the
globes
of
the
lamps
covered
with
a
paper
sent
forth
a
white
light
softening
the
colour
of
the
walls
hung
with
mauve
satin
through
the
as
through
the
slits
in
a
big
fan
the
coal
could
be
seen
in
the
fireplace
and
close
beside
the
clock
there
was
a
little
chest
with
silver
clasps
here
and
there
things
lay
about
which
gave
the
place
a
look
of
home
a
doll
in
the
middle
of
the
sofa
a
fichu
against
the
back
of
a
chair
and
on
the
a
knitted
woollen
vest
from
which
two
ivory
needles
were
hanging
with
their
points
downwards
it
was
altogether
a
peaceful
spot
suggesting
the
idea
of
propriety
and
innocent
family
life
arnoux
returned
and
madame
arnoux
appeared
at
the
other
doorway
as
she
was
enveloped
in
shadow
the
young
man
could
at
first
distinguish
only
her
head
she
wore
a
black
velvet
gown
and
in
her
hair
she
had
fastened
a
long
algerian
cap
in
a
red
silk
net
which
coiling
round
her
comb
fell
over
her
left
shoulder
arnoux
introduced
frederick
oh
i
remember
monsieur
perfectly
well
she
responded
then
the
guests
arrived
nearly
all
at
the
same
time
dittmer
lovarias
burrieu
the
composer
rosenwald
the
poet
théophile
lorris
two
art
critics
colleagues
of
hussonnet
a
paper
manufacturer
and
in
the
rear
the
illustrious
pierre
paul
meinsius
the
last
representative
of
the
grand
school
of
painting
who
blithely
carried
along
with
his
glory
his
years
and
his
big
paunch
when
they
were
passing
into
the
madame
arnoux
took
his
arm
a
chair
had
been
left
vacant
for
pellerin
arnoux
though
he
took
advantage
of
him
was
fond
of
him
besides
he
was
afraid
of
his
terrible
tongue
so
much
so
that
in
order
to
soften
him
he
had
given
a
portrait
of
him
in
accompanied
by
exaggerated
eulogies
and
pellerin
more
sensitive
about
distinction
than
about
money
made
his
appearance
about
eight
quite
out
of
breath
frederick
fancied
that
they
had
been
a
long
time
reconciled
he
liked
the
company
the
dishes
everything
the
which
resembled
a
mediæval
parlour
was
hung
with
stamped
leather
a
dutch
whatnot
faced
a
rack
for
chibouks
and
around
the
table
the
bohemian
glasses
variously
coloured
had
in
the
midst
of
the
flowers
and
fruits
the
effect
of
an
illumination
in
a
garden
he
had
to
make
his
choice
between
ten
sorts
of
mustard
he
partook
of
daspachio
of
curry
of
ginger
of
corsican
blackbirds
and
a
species
of
roman
macaroni
called
lasagna
he
drank
extraordinary
wines
and
tokay
arnoux
indeed
prided
himself
on
entertaining
people
in
good
style
with
an
eye
to
the
procurement
of
eatables
he
paid
court
to
drivers
and
was
in
league
with
the
cooks
of
great
houses
who
communicated
to
him
the
secrets
of
rare
sauces
but
frederick
was
particularly
amused
by
the
conversation
his
taste
for
travelling
was
tickled
by
dittmer
who
talked
about
the
east
he
gratified
his
curiosity
about
theatrical
matters
by
listening
to
rosenwald
chat
about
the
opera
and
the
atrocious
existence
of
bohemia
assumed
for
him
a
droll
aspect
when
seen
through
the
gaiety
of
hussonnet
who
related
in
a
picturesque
fashion
how
he
had
spent
an
entire
winter
with
no
food
except
dutch
cheese
then
a
discussion
between
lovarias
and
burrieu
about
the
florentine
school
gave
him
new
ideas
with
regard
to
masterpieces
widened
his
horizon
and
he
found
difficulty
in
restraining
his
enthusiasm
when
pellerin
exclaimed
do
bother
me
with
your
hideous
reality
what
does
it
mean
reality
some
see
things
black
others
blue
the
multitude
sees
them
there
is
nothing
less
natural
than
michael
angelo
there
is
nothing
more
powerful
the
anxiety
about
external
truth
is
a
mark
of
contemporary
baseness
and
art
will
become
if
things
go
on
that
way
a
sort
of
poor
joke
as
much
below
religion
as
it
is
below
poetry
and
as
much
below
politics
as
it
is
below
business
you
will
never
reach
its
end
yes
its
end
which
is
to
cause
within
us
an
impersonal
exaltation
with
petty
works
in
spite
of
all
your
finished
execution
look
for
instance
at
bassolier
pictures
they
are
pretty
coquettish
spruce
and
by
no
means
dull
you
might
put
them
into
your
pocket
bring
them
with
you
when
you
are
travelling
notaries
buy
them
for
twenty
thousand
francs
while
pictures
of
the
ideal
type
are
sold
for
three
sous
but
without
ideality
there
is
no
grandeur
without
grandeur
there
is
no
beauty
olympus
is
a
mountain
the
most
swagger
monument
will
always
be
the
pyramids
exuberance
is
better
than
taste
the
desert
is
better
than
a
and
a
savage
is
better
than
a
hairdresser
frederick
as
these
words
fell
upon
his
ear
glanced
towards
madame
arnoux
they
sank
into
his
soul
like
metals
falling
into
a
furnace
added
to
his
passion
and
supplied
the
material
of
love
his
chair
was
three
seats
below
hers
on
the
same
side
from
time
to
time
she
bent
forward
a
little
turning
aside
her
head
to
address
a
few
words
to
her
little
daughter
and
as
she
smiled
on
these
occasions
a
dimple
took
shape
in
her
cheek
giving
to
her
face
an
expression
of
more
dainty
as
soon
as
the
time
came
for
the
gentlemen
to
take
their
wine
she
disappeared
the
conversation
became
more
free
and
easy
arnoux
shone
in
it
and
frederick
was
astonished
at
the
cynicism
of
men
however
their
preoccupation
with
woman
established
between
them
and
him
as
it
were
an
equality
which
raised
him
in
his
own
estimation
when
they
had
returned
to
the
he
took
up
to
keep
himself
in
countenance
one
of
the
albums
which
lay
about
on
the
table
the
great
artists
of
the
day
had
illustrated
them
with
drawings
had
written
in
them
snatches
of
verse
or
prose
or
their
signatures
simply
in
the
midst
of
famous
names
he
found
many
that
he
had
never
heard
of
before
and
original
thoughts
appeared
only
underneath
a
flood
of
nonsense
all
these
effusions
contained
a
more
or
less
direct
expression
of
homage
towards
madame
arnoux
frederick
would
have
been
afraid
to
write
a
line
beside
them
she
went
into
her
boudoir
to
look
at
the
little
chest
with
silver
clasps
which
he
had
noticed
on
the
it
was
a
present
from
her
husband
a
work
of
the
renaissance
arnoux
friends
complimented
him
and
his
wife
thanked
him
his
tender
emotions
were
aroused
and
before
all
the
guests
he
gave
her
a
kiss
after
this
they
all
chatted
in
groups
here
and
there
the
worthy
meinsius
was
with
madame
arnoux
on
an
easy
chair
close
beside
the
fire
she
was
leaning
forward
towards
his
ear
their
heads
were
just
touching
and
frederick
would
have
been
glad
to
become
deaf
infirm
and
ugly
if
instead
he
had
an
illustrious
name
and
white
hair
in
short
if
he
only
happened
to
possess
something
which
would
install
him
in
such
intimate
association
with
her
he
began
once
more
to
eat
out
his
heart
furious
at
the
idea
of
being
so
young
a
man
but
she
came
into
the
corner
of
the
in
which
he
was
sitting
asked
him
whether
he
was
acquainted
with
any
of
the
guests
whether
he
was
fond
of
painting
how
long
he
had
been
a
student
in
paris
every
word
that
came
out
of
her
mouth
seemed
to
frederick
something
entirely
new
an
exclusive
appendage
of
her
personality
he
gazed
attentively
at
the
fringes
of
her
the
ends
of
which
caressed
her
bare
shoulder
and
he
was
unable
to
take
away
his
eyes
he
plunged
his
soul
into
the
whiteness
of
that
feminine
flesh
and
yet
he
did
not
venture
to
raise
his
eyelids
to
glance
at
her
higher
face
to
face
rosenwald
interrupted
them
begging
of
madame
arnoux
to
sing
something
he
played
a
prelude
she
waited
her
lips
opened
slightly
and
a
sound
pure
silvery
ascended
into
the
air
frederick
did
not
understand
a
single
one
of
the
italian
words
the
song
began
with
a
grave
measure
something
like
church
music
then
in
a
more
animated
strain
with
a
crescendo
movement
it
broke
into
repeated
bursts
of
sound
then
suddenly
subsided
and
the
melody
came
back
again
in
a
tender
fashion
with
a
wide
and
easy
swing
she
stood
beside
the
keyboard
with
her
arms
hanging
down
and
a
look
on
her
face
sometimes
in
order
to
read
the
music
she
advanced
her
forehead
for
a
moment
and
her
eyelashes
moved
to
and
fro
her
contralto
voice
in
the
low
notes
took
a
mournful
intonation
which
had
a
chilling
effect
on
the
listener
and
then
her
beautiful
head
with
those
great
brows
of
hers
bent
over
her
shoulder
her
bosom
swelled
her
eyes
were
wide
apart
her
neck
from
which
roulades
made
their
escape
fell
back
as
if
under
aërial
kisses
she
flung
out
three
sharp
notes
came
down
again
cast
forth
one
higher
still
and
after
a
silence
finished
with
an
rosenwald
did
not
leave
the
piano
he
continued
playing
to
amuse
himself
from
time
to
time
a
guest
stole
away
at
eleven
as
the
last
of
them
were
going
off
arnoux
went
out
along
with
pellerin
under
the
pretext
of
seeing
him
home
he
was
one
of
those
people
who
say
that
they
are
ill
when
they
do
not
take
a
turn
after
dinner
madame
arnoux
had
made
her
way
towards
the
anteroom
dittmer
and
hussonnet
bowed
to
her
she
stretched
out
her
hand
to
them
she
did
the
same
to
frederick
and
he
felt
as
it
were
something
penetrating
every
particle
of
his
skin
he
quitted
his
friends
he
wished
to
be
alone
his
heart
was
overflowing
why
had
she
offered
him
her
hand
was
it
a
thoughtless
act
or
an
encouragement
come
now
i
am
mad
besides
what
did
it
matter
when
he
could
now
visit
her
entirely
at
his
ease
live
in
the
very
atmosphere
she
breathed
the
streets
were
deserted
now
and
then
a
heavy
wagon
would
roll
past
shaking
the
pavements
the
houses
came
one
after
another
with
their
grey
fronts
their
closed
windows
and
he
thought
with
disdain
of
all
those
human
beings
who
lived
behind
those
walls
without
having
seen
her
and
not
one
of
whom
dreamed
of
her
existence
he
had
no
consciousness
of
his
surroundings
of
space
of
anything
and
striking
the
ground
with
his
heel
rapping
with
his
on
the
shutters
of
the
shops
he
kept
walking
on
continually
at
random
in
a
state
of
excitement
carried
away
by
his
emotions
suddenly
he
felt
himself
surrounded
by
a
circle
of
damp
air
and
found
that
he
was
on
the
edge
of
the
quays
the
shone
in
two
straight
lines
which
ran
on
endlessly
and
long
red
flames
flickered
in
the
depths
of
the
water
the
waves
were
while
the
sky
which
was
of
clearer
hue
seemed
to
be
supported
by
vast
masses
of
shadow
that
rose
on
each
side
of
the
river
the
darkness
was
intensified
by
buildings
whose
outlines
the
eye
could
not
distinguish
a
luminous
haze
floated
above
the
roofs
further
on
all
the
noises
of
the
night
had
melted
into
a
single
monotonous
hum
he
stopped
in
the
middle
of
the
pont
neuf
and
taking
off
his
hat
and
exposing
his
chest
he
drank
in
the
air
and
now
he
felt
as
if
something
that
was
inexhaustible
were
rising
up
from
the
very
depths
of
his
being
an
afflux
of
tenderness
that
enervated
him
like
the
motion
of
the
waves
under
his
eyes
a
slowly
struck
one
like
a
voice
calling
out
to
him
then
he
was
seized
with
one
of
those
shuddering
sensations
of
the
soul
in
which
one
seems
to
be
transported
into
a
higher
world
he
felt
as
it
were
endowed
with
some
extraordinary
faculty
the
aim
of
which
he
could
not
determine
he
seriously
asked
himself
whether
he
would
be
a
great
painter
or
a
great
poet
and
he
decided
in
favour
of
painting
for
the
exigencies
of
this
profession
would
bring
him
into
contact
with
madame
arnoux
so
then
he
had
found
his
vocation
the
object
of
his
existence
was
now
perfectly
clear
and
there
could
be
no
mistake
about
the
future
when
he
had
shut
his
door
he
heard
some
one
snoring
in
the
dark
closet
near
his
apartment
it
was
his
friend
he
no
longer
bestowed
a
thought
on
him
his
own
face
presented
itself
to
his
view
in
the
glass
he
thought
himself
handsome
and
for
a
minute
he
remained
gazing
at
himself
chapter
love
knoweth
no
laws
before
twelve
next
day
he
had
bought
a
box
of
colours
paintbrushes
and
an
easel
pellerin
consented
to
give
him
lessons
and
frederick
brought
him
to
his
lodgings
to
see
whether
anything
was
wanting
among
his
painting
utensils
deslauriers
had
come
back
and
the
second
armchair
was
occupied
by
a
young
man
the
clerk
said
pointing
towards
him
is
he
there
he
is
sénécal
frederick
disliked
this
young
man
his
forehead
was
heightened
by
the
way
in
which
he
wore
his
hair
cut
straight
like
a
brush
there
was
a
certain
hard
cold
look
in
his
grey
eyes
and
his
long
black
coat
his
entire
costume
savoured
of
the
pedagogue
and
the
ecclesiastic
they
first
discussed
topics
of
the
hour
amongst
others
the
of
rossini
sénécal
in
answer
to
a
question
declared
that
he
never
went
to
the
theatre
pellerin
opened
the
box
of
colours
are
these
all
for
you
said
the
clerk
why
certainly
well
really
what
a
notion
and
he
leaned
across
the
table
at
which
the
mathematical
tutor
was
turning
over
the
leaves
of
a
volume
of
louis
blanc
he
had
brought
it
with
him
and
was
reading
passages
from
it
in
low
tones
while
pellerin
and
frederick
were
examining
together
the
palette
the
knife
and
the
bladders
then
the
talk
came
round
to
the
dinner
at
arnoux
the
is
it
asked
sénécal
a
nice
gentleman
truly
why
now
said
pellerin
sénécal
replied
a
man
who
makes
money
by
political
turpitude
and
he
went
on
to
talk
about
a
lithograph
in
which
the
royal
family
was
all
represented
as
being
engaged
in
edifying
occupations
louis
philippe
had
a
copy
of
the
code
in
his
hand
the
queen
had
a
catholic
the
princesses
were
embroidering
the
duc
de
nemours
was
girding
on
a
sword
de
joinville
was
showing
a
map
to
his
young
brothers
and
at
the
end
of
the
apartment
could
be
seen
a
bed
with
two
divisions
this
picture
which
was
entitled
a
good
family
was
a
source
of
delight
to
commonplace
people
but
of
grief
to
patriots
pellerin
in
a
tone
of
vexation
as
if
he
had
been
the
producer
of
this
work
himself
observed
by
way
of
answer
that
every
opinion
had
some
value
sénécal
protested
art
should
aim
exclusively
at
promoting
morality
amongst
the
masses
the
only
subjects
that
ought
to
be
reproduced
were
those
which
impelled
people
to
virtuous
actions
all
others
were
injurious
but
that
depends
on
the
execution
cried
pellerin
i
might
produce
masterpieces
so
much
the
worse
for
you
then
you
have
no
right
what
no
monsieur
you
have
no
right
to
excite
my
interest
in
matters
of
which
i
disapprove
what
need
have
we
of
laborious
trifles
from
which
it
is
impossible
to
derive
any
benefit
those
venuses
for
instance
with
all
your
landscapes
i
see
there
no
instruction
for
the
people
show
us
rather
their
miseries
arouse
enthusiasm
in
us
for
their
sacrifices
ah
my
god
there
is
no
lack
of
subjects
the
farm
the
workshop
pellerin
stammered
forth
his
indignation
at
this
and
imagining
that
he
had
found
an
argument
molière
do
you
accept
him
certainly
said
sénécal
i
admire
him
as
the
precursor
of
the
french
revolution
ha
the
revolution
what
art
never
was
there
a
more
pitiable
epoch
none
greater
monsieur
pellerin
folded
his
arms
and
looking
at
him
straight
in
the
face
you
have
the
appearance
of
a
famous
member
of
the
national
guard
his
opponent
accustomed
to
discussions
responded
i
am
not
and
i
detest
it
just
as
much
as
you
but
with
such
principles
we
corrupt
the
crowd
this
sort
of
thing
however
is
profitable
to
the
government
it
would
not
be
so
powerful
but
for
the
complicity
of
a
lot
of
rogues
of
that
sort
the
painter
took
up
the
defence
of
the
for
opinions
exasperated
him
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
maintain
that
arnoux
was
really
a
man
with
a
heart
of
gold
devoted
to
his
friends
deeply
attached
to
his
wife
oho
if
you
offered
him
a
good
sum
he
would
not
refuse
to
let
her
serve
as
a
model
frederick
turned
pale
so
then
he
has
done
you
some
great
injury
monsieur
me
no
i
saw
him
once
at
a
café
with
a
friend
that
all
sénécal
had
spoken
truly
but
he
had
his
teeth
daily
set
on
edge
by
the
announcements
in
arnoux
was
for
him
the
representative
of
a
world
which
he
considered
fatal
to
democracy
an
austere
republican
he
suspected
that
there
was
something
corrupt
in
every
form
of
elegance
and
the
more
so
as
he
wanted
nothing
and
was
inflexible
in
his
integrity
they
found
some
difficulty
in
resuming
the
conversation
the
painter
soon
recalled
to
mind
his
appointment
the
tutor
his
pupils
and
when
they
had
gone
after
a
long
silence
deslauriers
asked
a
number
of
questions
about
arnoux
you
will
introduce
me
there
later
will
you
not
old
fellow
certainly
said
frederick
then
they
thought
about
settling
themselves
deslauriers
had
without
much
trouble
obtained
the
post
of
second
clerk
in
a
solicitor
office
he
had
also
entered
his
name
for
the
terms
at
the
law
school
and
bought
the
indispensable
books
and
the
life
of
which
they
had
dreamed
now
began
it
was
delightful
owing
to
their
youth
which
made
everything
assume
a
beautiful
aspect
as
deslauriers
had
said
nothing
as
to
any
pecuniary
arrangement
frederick
did
not
refer
to
the
subject
he
helped
to
defray
all
the
expenses
kept
the
cupboard
well
stocked
and
looked
after
all
the
household
requirements
but
if
it
happened
to
be
desirable
to
give
the
a
rating
the
clerk
took
that
on
his
own
shoulders
still
playing
the
part
which
he
had
assumed
in
their
college
days
of
protector
and
senior
separated
all
day
long
they
met
again
in
the
evening
each
took
his
place
at
the
fireside
and
set
about
his
work
but
ere
long
it
would
be
interrupted
then
would
follow
endless
outpourings
unaccountable
bursts
of
merriment
and
occasional
disputes
about
the
lamp
flaring
too
much
or
a
book
being
mislaid
momentary
ebullitions
of
anger
which
subsided
in
hearty
laughter
while
in
bed
they
left
open
the
door
of
the
little
room
where
deslauriers
slept
and
kept
chattering
to
each
other
from
a
distance
in
the
morning
they
walked
in
their
on
the
terrace
the
sun
rose
light
vapours
passed
over
the
river
from
the
close
beside
them
the
noise
of
screaming
reached
their
ears
and
the
smoke
from
their
pipes
whirled
round
in
the
clear
air
which
was
refreshing
to
their
eyes
still
puffed
from
sleep
while
they
inhaled
it
their
hearts
swelled
with
great
expectations
when
it
was
not
raining
on
sunday
they
went
out
together
and
arm
in
arm
they
sauntered
through
the
streets
the
same
reflection
nearly
always
occurred
to
them
at
the
same
time
or
else
they
would
go
on
chatting
without
noticing
anything
around
them
deslauriers
longed
for
riches
as
a
means
for
gaining
power
over
men
he
was
anxious
to
possess
an
influence
over
a
vast
number
of
people
to
make
a
great
noise
to
have
three
secretaries
under
his
command
and
to
give
a
big
political
dinner
once
a
month
frederick
would
have
furnished
for
himself
a
palace
in
the
moorish
fashion
to
spend
his
life
reclining
on
cashmere
divans
to
the
murmur
of
a
jet
of
water
attended
by
negro
pages
and
these
things
of
which
he
had
only
dreamed
became
in
the
end
so
definite
that
they
made
him
feel
as
dejected
as
if
he
had
lost
them
what
is
the
use
of
talking
about
all
these
things
said
he
when
we
never
have
them
who
knows
returned
deslauriers
in
spite
of
his
democratic
views
he
urged
frederick
to
get
an
introduction
into
the
dambreuses
house
the
other
by
way
of
objection
pointed
to
the
failure
of
his
previous
attempts
bah
go
back
there
they
give
you
an
invitation
towards
the
close
of
the
month
of
march
they
received
amongst
other
bills
of
a
rather
awkward
description
that
of
the
who
supplied
them
with
dinners
frederick
not
having
the
entire
amount
borrowed
a
hundred
crowns
from
deslauriers
a
fortnight
afterwards
he
renewed
the
same
request
and
the
clerk
administered
a
lecture
to
him
on
the
extravagant
habits
to
which
he
gave
himself
up
in
the
society
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
put
no
restraint
upon
himself
in
this
respect
a
view
of
venice
a
view
of
naples
and
another
of
constantinople
occupying
the
centre
of
three
walls
respectively
equestrian
subjects
by
alfred
de
dreux
here
and
there
a
group
by
pradier
over
the
mantelpiece
numbers
of
lying
on
the
piano
and
works
in
boards
on
the
floor
in
the
corners
encumbered
the
apartment
which
he
occupied
to
such
an
extent
that
it
was
hard
to
find
a
place
to
lay
a
book
on
or
to
move
one
elbows
about
freely
frederick
maintained
that
he
needed
all
this
for
his
painting
he
pursued
his
under
pellerin
but
when
he
called
on
the
artist
the
latter
was
often
out
being
accustomed
to
attend
at
every
funeral
and
public
occurrence
of
which
an
account
was
given
in
the
newspapers
and
so
it
was
that
frederick
spent
entire
hours
alone
in
the
studio
the
quietude
of
this
spacious
room
which
nothing
disturbed
save
the
scampering
of
the
mice
the
light
falling
from
the
ceiling
or
the
hissing
noise
of
the
stove
made
him
sink
into
a
kind
of
intellectual
ease
then
his
eyes
wandering
away
from
the
task
at
which
he
was
engaged
roamed
over
the
on
the
wall
around
the
objects
of
virtù
on
the
whatnot
along
the
torsos
on
which
the
dust
that
had
collected
made
as
it
were
shreds
of
velvet
and
like
a
traveller
who
has
lost
his
way
in
the
middle
of
a
wood
and
whom
every
path
brings
back
to
the
same
spot
continually
he
found
underlying
every
idea
in
his
mind
the
recollection
of
madame
arnoux
he
selected
days
for
calling
on
her
when
he
had
reached
the
second
floor
he
would
pause
on
the
threshold
hesitating
as
to
whether
he
ought
to
ring
or
not
steps
drew
nigh
the
door
opened
and
the
announcement
madame
is
gone
out
a
sense
of
relief
would
come
upon
him
as
if
a
weight
had
been
lifted
from
his
heart
he
met
her
however
on
the
first
occasion
there
were
three
other
ladies
with
her
the
next
time
it
was
in
the
afternoon
and
mademoiselle
marthe
came
on
the
scene
besides
the
men
whom
madame
arnoux
received
were
not
very
punctilious
about
paying
visits
for
the
sake
of
prudence
he
deemed
it
better
not
to
call
again
but
he
did
not
fail
to
present
himself
regularly
at
the
office
of
every
wednesday
in
order
to
get
an
invitation
to
the
thursday
dinners
and
he
remained
there
after
all
the
others
even
longer
than
regimbart
up
to
the
last
moment
pretending
to
be
looking
at
an
engraving
or
to
be
running
his
eye
through
a
newspaper
at
last
arnoux
would
say
to
him
shall
you
be
disengaged
evening
and
before
the
sentence
was
finished
he
would
give
an
affirmative
answer
arnoux
appeared
to
have
taken
a
fancy
to
him
he
showed
him
how
to
become
a
good
judge
of
wines
how
to
make
hot
punch
and
how
to
prepare
a
woodcock
ragoût
frederick
followed
his
advice
with
docility
feeling
an
attachment
to
everything
connected
with
madame
arnoux
her
furniture
her
servants
her
house
her
street
during
these
dinners
he
scarcely
uttered
a
word
he
kept
gazing
at
her
she
had
a
little
mole
close
to
her
temple
her
were
darker
than
the
rest
of
her
hair
and
were
always
a
little
moist
at
the
edges
from
time
to
time
she
stroked
them
with
only
two
fingers
he
knew
the
shape
of
each
of
her
nails
he
took
delight
in
listening
to
the
rustle
of
her
silk
skirt
as
she
swept
past
doors
he
stealthily
inhaled
the
perfume
that
came
from
her
handkerchief
her
comb
her
gloves
her
rings
were
for
him
things
of
special
interest
important
as
works
of
art
almost
endowed
with
life
like
individuals
all
took
possession
of
his
heart
and
strengthened
his
passion
he
had
not
been
sufficiently
to
conceal
it
from
deslauriers
when
he
came
home
from
madame
arnoux
he
would
wake
up
his
friend
as
if
inadvertently
in
order
to
have
an
opportunity
of
talking
about
her
deslauriers
who
slept
in
the
little
close
to
where
they
had
their
would
give
a
great
yawn
frederick
seated
himself
on
the
side
of
the
bed
at
first
he
spoke
about
the
dinner
then
he
referred
to
a
thousand
petty
details
in
which
he
saw
marks
of
contempt
or
of
affection
on
one
occasion
for
instance
she
had
refused
his
arm
in
order
to
take
dittmer
and
frederick
gave
vent
to
his
humiliation
ah
how
stupid
or
else
she
had
called
him
her
dear
friend
then
go
after
her
gaily
but
i
dare
not
do
that
said
frederick
well
then
think
no
more
about
her
good
night
deslauriers
thereupon
turned
on
his
side
and
fell
asleep
he
felt
utterly
unable
to
comprehend
this
love
which
seemed
to
him
the
last
weakness
of
adolescence
and
as
his
own
society
was
apparently
not
enough
to
content
frederick
he
conceived
the
idea
of
bringing
together
once
a
week
those
whom
they
both
recognised
as
friends
they
came
on
saturday
about
nine
the
three
algerine
curtains
were
carefully
drawn
the
lamp
and
four
were
burning
in
the
middle
of
the
table
the
filled
with
pipes
displayed
itself
between
the
the
a
flagon
of
rum
and
some
fancy
biscuits
they
discussed
the
immortality
of
the
soul
and
drew
comparisons
between
the
different
professors
one
evening
hussonnet
introduced
a
tall
young
man
attired
in
a
too
short
in
the
wrists
and
with
a
look
of
embarrassment
in
his
face
it
was
the
young
fellow
whom
they
had
gone
to
release
from
the
the
year
before
as
he
had
not
been
able
to
restore
the
box
of
lace
which
he
had
lost
in
the
scuffle
his
employer
had
accused
him
of
theft
and
threatened
to
prosecute
him
he
was
now
a
clerk
in
a
hussonnet
had
come
across
him
that
morning
at
the
corner
of
the
street
and
brought
him
along
for
dussardier
in
a
spirit
of
gratitude
had
expressed
a
wish
to
see
the
other
he
stretched
out
towards
frederick
the
still
full
which
he
had
religiously
preserved
in
the
hope
of
being
able
to
give
it
back
the
young
men
invited
him
to
pay
them
a
second
visit
and
he
was
not
slow
in
doing
so
they
all
had
sympathies
in
common
at
first
their
hatred
of
the
government
reached
the
height
of
an
unquestionable
dogma
martinon
alone
attempted
to
defend
louis
philippe
they
overwhelmed
him
with
the
commonplaces
scattered
through
the
newspapers
the
bastillization
of
paris
the
september
laws
pritchard
lord
guizot
so
that
martinon
held
his
tongue
for
fear
of
giving
offence
to
somebody
during
his
seven
years
at
college
he
had
never
incurred
the
penalty
of
an
imposition
and
at
the
law
school
he
knew
how
to
make
himself
agreeable
to
the
professors
he
usually
wore
a
big
of
the
colour
of
putty
with
goloshes
but
one
evening
he
presented
himself
arrayed
like
a
bridegroom
in
a
velvet
waistcoat
a
white
tie
and
a
gold
chain
the
astonishment
of
the
other
young
men
was
greatly
increased
when
they
learned
that
he
had
just
come
away
from
dambreuse
house
in
fact
the
banker
dambreuse
had
just
bought
a
portion
of
an
extensive
wood
from
martinon
senior
and
when
the
worthy
man
introduced
his
son
the
other
had
invited
them
both
to
dinner
was
there
a
good
supply
of
truffles
there
asked
deslauriers
and
did
you
take
his
wife
by
the
waist
between
the
two
doors
hereupon
the
conversation
turned
on
women
pellerin
would
not
admit
that
there
were
beautiful
women
he
preferred
tigers
besides
the
human
female
was
an
inferior
creature
in
the
æsthetic
hierarchy
what
fascinates
you
is
just
the
very
thing
that
degrades
her
as
an
idea
i
mean
her
breasts
her
hair
nevertheless
urged
frederick
long
black
hair
and
large
dark
eyes
oh
we
know
all
about
that
cried
hussonnet
enough
of
andalusian

those
things
are

dussardier
did

they
all
pressed
him
to
ascertain
what
his
tastes
were
well
said
he
colouring
for
my
part
i
would
like
to
love
the
same
one
always
this
was
said
in
such
a
way
that
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
some
of
them
being
surprised
at
this
candour
and
others
finding
in
his
words
perhaps
the
secret
yearning
of
their
souls
sénécal
placed
his
glass
of
beer
on
the
mantelpiece
and
declared
dogmatically
that
as
prostitution
was
tyrannical
and
marriage
immoral
it
was
better
to
practice
abstinence
deslauriers
regarded
women
as
a
source
of
amusement
nothing
more
de
cisy
looked
upon
them
with
the
utmost
dread
brought
up
under
the
eyes
of
a
grandmother
who
was
a
devotee
he
found
the
society
of
those
young
fellows
as
alluring
as
a
place
of
and
as
instructive
as
the
sorbonne
they
gave
him
lessons
without
stint
and
so
much
zeal
did
he
exhibit
that
he
even
wanted
to
smoke
in
spite
of
the
qualms
that
upset
him
every
time
he
made
the
experiment
frederick
paid
him
the
greatest
attention
he
admired
the
shade
of
this
young
gentleman
cravat
the
fur
on
his
overcoat
and
especially
his
boots
as
thin
as
gloves
and
so
very
neat
and
fine
that
they
had
a
look
of
insolent
superiority
his
carriage
used
to
wait
for
him
below
in
the
street
one
evening
after
his
departure
when
there
was
a
fall
of
snow
sénécal
began
to
complain
about
his
having
a
coachman
he
declaimed
against
exquisites
and
against
the
jockey
club
he
had
more
respect
for
a
workman
than
for
these
fine
gentlemen
for
my
part
anyhow
i
work
for
my
livelihood
i
am
a
poor
man
that
quite
evident
said
frederick
at
length
losing
patience
the
tutor
conceived
a
grudge
against
him
for
this
remark
but
as
regimbart
said
he
knew
sénécal
pretty
well
frederick
wishing
to
be
civil
to
a
friend
of
the
arnoux
asked
him
to
come
to
the
saturday
meetings
and
the
two
patriots
were
glad
to
be
brought
together
in
this
way
however
they
took
opposite
views
of
things
sénécal
who
had
a
skull
of
the
angular
type
fixed
his
attention
merely
on
systems
whereas
regimbart
on
the
contrary
saw
in
facts
nothing
but
facts
the
thing
that
chiefly
troubled
him
was
the
rhine
frontier
he
claimed
to
be
an
authority
on
the
subject
of
artillery
and
got
his
clothes
made
by
a
tailor
of
the
polytechnic
school
the
first
day
when
they
asked
him
to
take
some
cakes
he
disdainfully
shrugged
his
shoulders
saying
that
these
might
suit
women
and
on
the
next
few
occasions
his
manner
was
not
much
more
gracious
whenever
speculative
ideas
had
reached
a
certain
elevation
he
would
mutter
oh
no
utopias
no
dreams
on
the
subject
of
art
though
he
used
to
visit
the
studios
where
he
occasionally
out
of
complaisance
gave
a
lesson
in
fencing
his
opinions
were
not
remarkable
for
their
excellence
he
compared
the
style
of
marast
to
that
of
voltaire
and
mademoiselle
vatnaz
to
madame
de
staël
on
account
of
an
ode
on
poland
in
which
there
was
some
spirit
in
short
regimbart
bored
everyone
and
especially
deslauriers
for
the
citizen
was
a
friend
of
the
arnoux
family
now
the
clerk
was
most
anxious
to
visit
those
people
in
the
hope
that
he
might
there
make
the
acquaintance
of
some
persons
who
would
be
an
advantage
to
him
when
are
you
going
to
take
me
there
with
you
he
would
say
arnoux
was
either
overburdened
with
business
or
else
starting
on
a
journey
then
it
was
not
worth
while
as
the
dinners
were
coming
to
an
end
if
he
had
been
called
on
to
risk
his
life
for
his
friend
frederick
would
have
done
so
but
as
he
was
desirous
of
making
as
good
a
figure
as
possible
and
with
this
view
was
most
careful
about
his
language
and
manners
and
so
attentive
to
his
costume
that
he
always
presented
himself
at
the
office
of
irreproachably
gloved
he
was
afraid
that
deslauriers
with
his
shabby
black
coat
his
exterior
and
his
swaggering
kind
of
talk
might
make
himself
disagreeable
to
madame
arnoux
and
thus
compromise
him
and
lower
him
in
her
estimation
the
other
results
would
have
been
bad
enough
but
the
last
one
would
have
annoyed
him
a
thousand
times
more
the
clerk
saw
that
his
friend
did
not
wish
to
keep
his
promise
and
frederick
silence
seemed
to
him
an
aggravation
of
the
insult
he
would
have
liked
to
exercise
absolute
control
over
him
to
see
him
developing
in
accordance
with
the
ideal
of
their
youth
and
his
inactivity
excited
the
clerk
indignation
as
a
breach
of
duty
and
a
want
of
loyalty
towards
himself
moreover
frederick
with
his
thoughts
full
of
madame
arnoux
frequently
talked
about
her
husband
and
deslauriers
now
began
an
intolerable
course
of
boredom
by
repeating
the
name
a
hundred
times
a
day
at
the
end
of
each
remark
like
the
of
an
idiot
when
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
he
would
answer
come
in
arnoux
at
the
restaurant
he
asked
for
a
brie
cheese
in
imitation
of
arnoux
and
at
night
pretending
to
wake
up
from
a
bad
dream
he
would
rouse
his
comrade
by
howling
out
arnoux
arnoux
at
last
frederick
worn
out
said
to
him
one
day
in
a
piteous
voice
oh
do
bother
me
about
arnoux
never
replied
the
clerk
he
always
everywhere
burning
or
icy
cold
the
pictured
form
of
arnoux

hold

exclaimed
frederick
raising
his
fist
then
less
angrily
he
added
you
know
well
this
is
a
painful
subject
to
me
oh
forgive
me
old
fellow
returned
deslauriers
with
a
very
low
bow
from
this
time
forth
we
will
be
considerate
towards
nerves
again
i
say
forgive
me
a
thousand
pardons
and
so
this
little
joke
came
to
an
end
but
three
weeks
later
one
evening
deslauriers
said
to
him
well
i
have
just
seen
madame
arnoux
where
pray
at
the
palais
with
balandard
the
solicitor
a
dark
woman
is
she
not
of
the
middle
height
frederick
made
a
gesture
of
assent
he
waited
for
deslauriers
to
speak
at
the
least
expression
of
admiration
he
would
have
been
most
effusive
and
would
have
fairly
hugged
the
other
however
deslauriers
remained
silent
at
last
unable
to
contain
himself
any
longer
frederick
with
assumed
indifference
asked
him
what
he
thought
of
her
deslauriers
considered
that
she
was
not
so
bad
but
still
nothing
extraordinary
ha
you
think
so
said
frederick
they
soon
reached
the
month
of
august
the
time
when
he
was
to
present
himself
for
his
second
examination
according
to
the
prevailing
opinion
the
subjects
could
be
made
up
in
a
fortnight
frederick
having
full
confidence
in
his
own
powers
swallowed
up
in
a
trice
the
first
four
books
of
the
code
of
procedure
the
first
three
of
the
penal
code
many
bits
of
the
system
of
criminal
investigation
and
a
part
of
the
civil
code
with
the
annotations
of
poncelet
the
night
before
deslauriers
made
him
run
through
the
whole
course
a
process
which
did
not
finish
till
morning
and
in
order
to
take
advantage
of
even
the
last
quarter
of
an
hour
continued
questioning
him
while
they
walked
along
the
footpath
together
as
several
examinations
were
taking
place
at
the
same
time
there
were
many
persons
in
the
precincts
and
amongst
others
hussonnet
and
cisy
young
men
never
failed
to
come
and
watch
these
ordeals
when
the
fortunes
of
their
comrades
were
at
stake
frederick
put
on
the
traditional
black
gown
then
followed
by
the
throng
with
three
other
students
he
entered
a
spacious
apartment
into
which
the
light
penetrated
through
uncurtained
windows
and
which
was
garnished
with
benches
ranged
along
the
walls
in
the
centre
leather
chairs
were
drawn
round
a
table
adorned
with
a
green
cover
this
separated
the
candidates
from
the
examiners
in
their
red
gowns
and
ermine
the
head
examiners
wearing
flat
caps
frederick
found
himself
the
last
but
one
in
the
series
an
unfortunate
place
in
answer
to
the
first
question
as
to
the
difference
between
a
convention
and
a
contract
he
defined
the
one
as
if
it
were
the
other
and
the
professor
who
was
a
fair
sort
of
man
said
to
him
do
be
agitated
monsieur
compose
yourself
then
having
asked
two
easy
questions
which
were
answered
in
a
doubtful
fashion
he
passed
on
at
last
to
the
fourth
this
wretched
beginning
made
frederick
lose
his
head
deslauriers
who
was
facing
him
amongst
the
spectators
made
a
sign
to
him
to
indicate
that
it
was
not
a
hopeless
case
yet
and
at
the
second
batch
of
questions
dealing
with
the
criminal
law
he
came
out
tolerably
well
but
after
the
third
with
reference
to
the
mystic
will
the
examiner
having
remained
impassive
the
whole
time
his
mental
distress
redoubled
for
hussonnet
brought
his
hands
together
as
if
to
applaud
whilst
deslauriers
liberally
indulged
in
shrugs
of
the
shoulders
finally
the
moment
was
reached
when
it
was
necessary
to
be
examined
on
procedure
the
professor
displeased
at
listening
to
theories
opposed
to
his
own
asked
him
in
a
churlish
tone
and
so
this
is
your
view
monsieur
how
do
you
reconcile
the
principle
of
article
of
the
civil
code
with
this
application
by
a
third
party
to
set
aside
a
judgment
by
default
frederick
had
a
great
headache
from
not
having
slept
the
night
before
a
ray
of
sunlight
penetrating
through
one
of
the
slits
in
a
venetian
blind
fell
on
his
face
standing
behind
the
seat
he
kept
wriggling
about
and
tugging
at
his
moustache
i
am
still
awaiting
your
answer
the
man
with
the
cap
observed
and
as
frederick
movements
no
doubt
irritated
him
you
wo
find
it
in
that
moustache
of
yours
this
sarcasm
made
the
spectators
laugh
the
professor
feeling
flattered
adopted
a
wheedling
tone
he
put
two
more
questions
with
reference
to
adjournment
and
summary
jurisdiction
then
nodded
his
head
by
way
of
approval
the
examination
was
over
frederick
retired
into
the
vestibule
while
an
usher
was
taking
off
his
gown
to
draw
it
over
some
other
person
immediately
afterwards
his
friends
gathered
around
him
and
succeeded
in
fairly
bothering
him
with
their
conflicting
opinions
as
to
the
result
of
his
examination
presently
the
announcement
was
made
in
a
sonorous
voice
at
the
entrance
of
the
hall
the
third
was
put
off
sent
packing
said
hussonnet
let
us
go
away
in
front
of
the
lodge
they
met
martinon
flushed
excited
with
a
smile
on
his
face
and
the
halo
of
victory
around
his
brow
he
had
just
passed
his
final
examination
without
any
impediment
all
he
had
now
to
do
was
the
thesis
before
a
fortnight
he
would
be
a
licentiate
his
family
enjoyed
the
acquaintance
of
a
minister
a
beautiful
career
was
opening
before
him
all
the
same
this
puts
you
into
a
mess
said
deslauriers
there
is
nothing
so
humiliating
as
to
see
blockheads
succeed
in
undertakings
in
which
we
fail
frederick
filled
with
vexation
replied
that
he
did
not
care
a
straw
about
the
matter
he
had
higher
pretensions
and
as
hussonnet
made
a
show
of
leaving
frederick
took
him
aside
and
said
to
him
not
a
word
about
this
to
them
mind
it
was
easy
to
keep
it
secret
since
arnoux
was
starting
the
next
morning
for
germany
when
he
came
back
in
the
evening
the
clerk
found
his
friend
singularly
altered
he
danced
about
and
whistled
and
the
other
was
astonished
at
this
capricious
change
of
mood
frederick
declared
that
he
did
not
intend
to
go
home
to
his
mother
as
he
meant
to
spend
his
holidays
working
at
the
news
of
arnoux
departure
a
feeling
of
delight
had
taken
possession
of
him
he
might
present
himself
at
the
house
whenever
he
liked
without
any
fear
of
having
his
visits
broken
in
upon
the
consciousness
of
absolute
security
would
make
him
at
last
he
would
not
stand
aloof
he
would
not
be
separated
from
her
something
more
powerful
than
an
iron
chain
attached
him
to
paris
a
voice
from
the
depths
of
his
heart
called
out
to
him
to
remain
there
were
certain
obstacles
in
his
path
these
he
got
over
by
writing
to
his
mother
he
first
of
all
admitted
that
he
had
failed
to
pass
owing
to
alterations
made
in
the
course
a
mere
mischance
an
unfair
thing
besides
all
the
great
advocates
he
referred
to
them
by
name
had
been
rejected
at
their
examinations
but
he
calculated
on
presenting
himself
again
in
the
month
of
november
now
having
no
time
to
lose
he
would
not
go
home
this
year
and
he
asked
in
addition
to
the
quarterly
allowance
for
two
hundred
and
fifty
francs
to
get
coached
in
law
by
a
private
tutor
which
would
be
of
great
assistance
to
him
and
he
threw
around
the
entire
epistle
a
garland
of
regrets
condolences
expressions
of
endearment
and
protestations
of
filial
love
madame
moreau
who
had
been
expecting
him
the
following
day
was
doubly
grieved
she
threw
a
veil
over
her
son
misadventure
and
in
answer
told
him
to
come
all
the
same
frederick
would
not
give
way
and
the
result
was
a
falling
out
between
them
however
at
the
end
of
the
week
he
received
the
amount
of
the
quarter
allowance
together
with
the
sum
required
for
the
payment
of
the
private
tutor
which
helped
to
pay
for
a
pair
of
trousers
a
white
felt
hat
and
a
switch
when
he
had
procured
all
these
things
he
thought
perhaps
this
is
only
a
hairdresser
fancy
on
my
part
and
a
feeling
of
considerable
hesitation
took
possession
of
him
in
order
to
make
sure
as
to
whether
he
ought
to
call
on
madame
arnoux
he
tossed
three
coins
into
the
air
in
succession
on
each
occasion
luck
was
in
his
favour
so
then
fate
must
have
ordained
it
he
hailed
a
cab
and
drove
to
the
rue
de
choiseul
he
quickly
ascended
the
staircase
and
drew
the
but
without
effect
he
felt
as
if
he
were
about
to
faint
then
with
fierce
energy
he
shook
the
heavy
silk
tassel
there
was
a
resounding
peal
which
gradually
died
away
till
no
further
sound
was
heard
frederick
got
rather
frightened
he
pasted
his
ear
to
the
door
not
a
breath
he
looked
in
through
the
and
only
saw
two
on
the
in
the
midst
of
designs
of
flowers
at
last
he
was
on
the
point
of
going
away
when
he
changed
his
mind
this
time
he
gave
a
timid
little
ring
the
door
flew
open
and
arnoux
himself
appeared
on
the
threshold
with
his
hair
all
in
disorder
his
face
crimson
and
his
features
distorted
by
an
expression
of
sullen
embarrassment
hallo
what
the
deuce
brings
you
here
come
in
he
led
frederick
not
into
the
boudoir
or
into
the
bedroom
but
into
the
where
on
the
table
could
be
seen
a
bottle
of
champagne
and
two
glasses
and
in
an
abrupt
tone
there
is
something
you
want
to
ask
me
my
dear
friend
no
nothing
nothing
stammered
the
young
man
trying
to
think
of
some
excuse
for
his
visit
at
length
he
said
to
arnoux
that
he
had
called
to
know
whether
they
had
heard
from
him
as
hussonnet
had
announced
that
he
had
gone
to
germany
not
at
all
returned
arnoux
what
a
fellow
that
is
to
take
everything
in
the
wrong
way
in
order
to
conceal
his
agitation
frederick
kept
walking
from
right
to
left
in
the
happening
to
come
into
contact
with
a
chair
he
knocked
down
a
parasol
which
had
been
laid
across
it
and
the
ivory
handle
got
broken
good
heavens
he
exclaimed
how
sorry
i
am
for
having
broken
madame
arnoux
parasol
at
this
remark
the
raised
his
head
and
smiled
in
a
very
peculiar
fashion
frederick
taking
advantage
of
the
opportunity
thus
offered
to
talk
about
her
added
shyly
could
i
not
see
her
no
she
had
gone
to
the
country
to
see
her
mother
who
was
ill
he
did
not
venture
to
ask
any
questions
as
to
the
length
of
time
that
she
would
be
away
he
merely
enquired
what
was
madame
arnoux
native
place
chartres
does
this
astonish
you
astonish
me
oh
no
why
should
it
not
in
the
least
after
that
they
could
find
absolutely
nothing
to
talk
about
arnoux
having
made
a
cigarette
for
himself
kept
walking
round
the
table
puffing
frederick
standing
near
the
stove
stared
at
the
walls
the
whatnot
and
the
floor
and
delightful
pictures
flitted
through
his
memory
or
rather
before
his
eyes
then
he
left
the
apartment
a
piece
of
a
newspaper
rolled
up
into
a
ball
lay
on
the
floor
in
the
anteroom
arnoux
snatched
it
up
and
raising
himself
on
the
tips
of
his
toes
he
stuck
it
into
the
bell
in
order
as
he
said
that
he
might
be
able
to
go
and
finish
his
interrupted
siesta
then
as
he
grasped
frederick
hand
kindly
tell
the
porter
that
i
am
not
in
and
he
shut
the
door
after
him
with
a
bang
frederick
descended
the
staircase
step
by
step
the
of
this
first
attempt
discouraged
him
as
to
the
possible
results
of
those
that
might
follow
then
began
three
months
of
absolute
boredom
as
he
had
nothing
to
do
his
melancholy
was
aggravated
by
the
want
of
occupation
he
spent
whole
hours
gazing
from
the
top
of
his
balcony
at
the
river
as
it
flowed
between
the
quays
with
their
bulwarks
of
grey
stone
blackened
here
and
there
by
the
seams
of
the
sewers
with
a
pontoon
of
washerwomen
moored
close
to
the
bank
where
some
brats
were
amusing
themselves
by
making
a
swim
in
the
slime
his
eyes
turning
aside
from
the
stone
bridge
of
nôtre
dame
and
the
three
suspension
bridges
continually
directed
their
glance
towards
the
resting
on
a
group
of
old
trees
resembling
the
of
the
montereau
wharf
the
tower
the
hôtel
de
ville
and
rose
up
in
front
of
him
amid
a
confused
mass
of
roofs
and
the
genius
of
the
july
column
glittered
at
the
eastern
side
like
a
large
gold
star
whilst
at
the
other
end
the
dome
of
the
tuileries
showed
its
outlines
against
the
sky
in
one
great
round
mass
of
blue
madame
arnoux
house
must
be
on
this
side
in
the
rear
he
went
back
to
his
bedchamber
then
throwing
himself
on
the
sofa
he
abandoned
himself
to
a
confused
succession
of
thoughts
plans
of
work
schemes
for
the
guidance
of
his
conduct
attempts
to
divine
the
future
at
last
in
order
to
shake
off
broodings
all
about
himself
he
went
out
into
the
open
air
he
plunged
at
random
into
the
latin
quarter
usually
so
noisy
but
deserted
at
this
particular
time
for
the
students
had
gone
back
to
join
their
families
the
huge
walls
of
the
colleges
which
the
silence
seemed
to
lengthen
wore
a
still
more
melancholy
aspect
all
sorts
of
peaceful
sounds
could
be
heard
the
flapping
of
wings
in
cages
the
noise
made
by
the
turning
of
a
lathe
or
the
strokes
of
a
cobbler
hammer
and
the
men
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
street
looked
up
at
each
house
fruitlessly
in
the
interior
of
a
solitary
café
the
barmaid
was
yawning
between
her
two
full
decanters
the
newspapers
were
left
undisturbed
on
the
tables
of
in
the
ironing
establishments
linen
quivered
under
the
puffs
of
tepid
wind
from
time
to
time
he
stopped
to
look
at
the
window
of
a
an
omnibus
which
grazed
the
footpath
as
it
came
rumbling
along
made
him
turn
round
and
when
he
found
himself
before
the
luxembourg
he
went
no
further
occasionally
he
was
attracted
towards
the
boulevards
by
the
hope
of
finding
there
something
that
might
amuse
him
after
he
had
passed
through
dark
alleys
from
which
his
nostrils
were
greeted
by
fresh
moist
odours
he
reached
vast
desolate
open
spaces
dazzling
with
light
in
which
monuments
cast
at
the
side
of
the
pavement
notches
of
black
shadow
but
once
more
the
wagons
and
the
shops
appeared
and
the
crowd
had
the
effect
of
stunning
him
especially
on
sunday
when
from
the
bastille
to
the
madeleine
it
kept
swaying
in
one
immense
flood
over
the
asphalt
in
the
midst
of
a
cloud
of
dust
in
an
incessant
clamour
he
felt
disgusted
at
the
meanness
of
the
faces
the
silliness
of
the
talk
and
the
idiotic
that
oozed
through
these
sweating
foreheads
however
the
consciousness
of
being
superior
to
these
individuals
mitigated
the
weariness
which
he
experienced
in
gazing
at
them
every
day
he
went
to
the
office
of
and
in
order
to
ascertain
when
madame
arnoux
would
be
back
he
made
elaborate
enquiries
about
her
mother
arnoux
answer
never
varied
the
change
for
the
better
was
continuing
his
wife
with
his
little
daughter
would
be
returning
the
following
week
the
longer
she
delayed
in
coming
back
the
more
uneasiness
frederick
exhibited
so
that
arnoux
touched
by
so
much
affection
brought
him
five
or
six
times
a
week
to
dine
at
a
restaurant
in
the
long
talks
which
they
had
together
on
these
occasions
frederick
discovered
that
the
was
not
a
very
intellectual
type
of
man
arnoux
might
however
take
notice
of
his
chilling
manner
and
now
frederick
deemed
it
advisable
to
pay
back
in
a
small
measure
his
polite
attentions
so
being
anxious
to
do
things
on
a
good
scale
the
young
man
sold
all
his
new
clothes
to
a
for
the
sum
of
eighty
francs
and
having
increased
it
with
a
hundred
more
francs
which
he
had
left
he
called
at
arnoux
house
to
bring
him
out
to
dine
regimbart
happened
to
be
there
and
all
three
of
them
set
forth
for
les
trois
frères
provençaux
the
citizen
began
by
taking
off
his
surtout
and
knowing
that
the
two
others
would
defer
to
his
gastronomic
tastes
drew
up
the
but
in
vain
did
he
make
his
way
to
the
kitchen
to
speak
himself
to
the
go
down
to
the
cellar
with
every
corner
of
which
he
was
familiar
and
send
for
the
master
of
the
establishment
to
whom
he
gave
a
blowing
up
he
was
not
satisfied
with
the
dishes
the
wines
or
the
attendance
at
each
new
dish
at
each
fresh
bottle
as
soon
as
he
had
swallowed
the
first
mouthful
the
first
draught
he
threw
down
his
fork
or
pushed
his
glass
some
distance
away
from
him
then
leaning
on
his
elbows
on
the
tablecloth
and
stretching
out
his
arms
he
declared
in
a
loud
tone
that
he
could
no
longer
dine
in
paris
finally
not
knowing
what
to
put
into
his
mouth
regimbart
ordered
dressed
with
oil
quite
plain
which
though
only
a
partial
success
slightly
appeased
him
then
he
had
a
talk
with
the
waiter
all
about
the
latter
predecessors
at
the
provençaux
what
had
become
of
antoine
and
a
fellow
named
eugène
and
théodore
the
little
fellow
who
always
used
to
attend
down
stairs
there
was
much
finer
fare
in
those
days
and
burgundy
vintages
the
like
of
which
they
would
never
see
again
then
there
was
a
discussion
as
to
the
value
of
ground
in
the
suburbs
arnoux
having
speculated
in
that
way
and
looked
on
it
as
a
safe
thing
in
the
meantime
however
he
would
lie
out
of
the
interest
on
his
money
as
he
did
not
want
to
sell
out
at
any
price
regimbart
would
find
out
some
one
to
whom
he
could
let
the
ground
and
so
these
two
gentlemen
proceeded
at
the
close
of
the
dessert
to
make
calculations
with
a
lead
pencil
they
went
out
to
get
coffee
in
the
on
the
in
the
passage
du
saumon
frederick
had
to
remain
on
his
legs
while
interminable
games
of
billiards
were
being
played
drenched
in
innumerable
glasses
of
beer
and
he
lingered
on
there
till
midnight
without
knowing
why
through
want
of
energy
through
sheer
senselessness
in
the
vague
expectation
that
something
might
happen
which
would
give
a
favourable
turn
to
his
love
when
then
would
he
next
see
her
frederick
was
in
a
state
of
despair
about
it
but
one
evening
towards
the
close
of
november
arnoux
said
to
him
my
wife
you
know
came
back
yesterday
next
day
at
five
he
made
his
way
to
her
house
he
began
by
congratulating
her
on
her
mother
recovery
from
such
a
serious
illness
why
no
who
told
you
that
arnoux
she
gave
vent
to
a
slight
ah
then
added
that
she
had
grave
fears
at
first
which
however
had
now
been
dispelled
she
was
seated
close
beside
the
fire
in
an
upholstered
he
was
on
the
sofa
with
his
hat
between
his
knees
and
the
conversation
was
difficult
to
carry
on
as
it
was
broken
off
nearly
every
minute
so
he
got
no
chance
of
giving
utterance
to
his
sentiments
but
when
he
began
to
complain
of
having
to
study
legal
quibbles
she
answered
oh
i
understand
business
and
she
let
her
face
fall
buried
suddenly
in
her
own
reflections
he
was
eager
to
know
what
they
were
and
even
did
not
bestow
a
thought
on
anything
else
the
twilight
shadows
gathered
around
them
she
rose
having
to
go
out
about
some
shopping
then
she
reappeared
in
a
bonnet
trimmed
with
velvet
and
a
black
mantle
edged
with
minever
he
plucked
up
courage
and
offered
to
accompany
her
it
was
now
so
dark
that
one
could
scarcely
see
anything
the
air
was
cold
and
had
an
unpleasant
odour
owing
to
a
heavy
fog
which
partially
blotted
out
the
fronts
of
the
houses
frederick
inhaled
it
with
delight
for
he
could
feel
through
the
wadding
of
his
coat
the
form
of
her
arm
and
her
hand
cased
in
a
chamois
glove
with
two
buttons
her
little
hand
which
he
would
have
liked
to
cover
with
kisses
leaned
on
his
sleeve
owing
to
the
slipperiness
of
the
pavement
they
lost
their
balance
a
little
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
they
were
both
rocked
by
the
wind
in
the
midst
of
a
cloud
the
glitter
of
the
lamps
on
the
boulevard
brought
him
back
to
the
realities
of
existence
the
opportunity
was
a
good
one
there
was
no
time
to
lose
he
gave
himself
as
far
as
the
rue
de
richeliéu
to
declare
his
love
but
almost
at
that
very
moment
in
front
of
a
she
stopped
abruptly
and
said
to
him
we
are
at
the
place
thanks
on
thursday
is
it
not
as
usual
the
dinners
were
now
renewed
and
the
more
visits
he
paid
at
madame
arnoux
the
more
his
increased
the
contemplation
of
this
woman
had
an
enervating
effect
upon
him
like
the
use
of
a
perfume
that
is
too
strong
it
penetrated
into
the
very
depths
of
his
nature
and
became
almost
a
kind
of
habitual
sensation
a
new
mode
of
existence
the
prostitutes
whom
he
brushed
past
under
the
gaslight
the
female
breaking
into
bursts
of
melody
the
ladies
rising
on
horseback
at
full
gallop
the
shopkeepers
wives
on
foot
the
grisettes
at
their
windows
all
women
brought
her
before
his
mental
vision
either
from
the
effect
of
their
resemblance
to
her
or
the
violent
contrast
to
her
which
they
presented
as
he
walked
along
by
the
shops
he
gazed
at
the
cashmeres
the
laces
and
the
jewelled
eardrops
imagining
how
they
would
look
draped
around
her
figure
sewn
in
her
corsage
or
lighting
up
her
dark
hair
in
the
baskets
the
bouquets
blossomed
for
her
to
choose
one
as
she
passed
in
the
shoemakers
the
little
satin
slippers
with
edges
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
her
foot
every
street
led
towards
her
house
the
stood
in
their
places
to
carry
her
home
the
more
quickly
paris
was
associated
with
her
person
and
the
great
city
with
all
its
noises
roared
around
her
like
an
immense
orchestra
when
he
went
into
the
jardin
des
plantes
the
sight
of
a
carried
him
off
into
distant
countries
they
were
travelling
together
on
the
backs
of
dromedaries
under
the
awnings
of
elephants
in
the
cabin
of
a
yacht
amongst
the
blue
archipelagoes
or
side
by
side
on
mules
with
little
bells
attached
to
them
who
went
stumbling
through
the
grass
against
broken
columns
sometimes
he
stopped
in
the
louvre
before
old
pictures
and
his
love
embracing
her
even
in
vanished
centuries
he
substituted
her
for
the
personages
in
the
paintings
wearing
a
hennin
on
her
head
she
was
praying
on
bended
knees
before
a
window
lady
paramount
of
castile
or
flanders
she
remained
seated
in
a
starched
ruff
and
a
body
lined
with
whalebone
with
big
puffs
then
he
saw
her
descending
some
wide
porphyry
staircase
in
the
midst
of
senators
under
a
dais
of
ostriches
feathers
in
a
robe
of
brocade
at
another
time
he
dreamed
of
her
in
yellow
silk
trousers
on
the
cushions
of
a
harem
and
all
that
was
beautiful
the
scintillation
of
the
stars
certain
tunes
in
music
the
turn
of
a
phrase
the
outlines
of
a
face
led
him
to
think
about
her
in
an
abrupt
unconscious
fashion
as
for
trying
to
make
her
his
mistress
he
was
sure
that
any
such
attempt
would
be
futile
one
evening
dittmer
on
his
arrival
kissed
her
on
the
forehead
lovarias
did
the
same
observing
you
give
me
leave
do
you
as
it
is
a
friend
privilege
frederick
stammered
out
it
seems
to
me
that
we
are
all
friends
not
all
old
friends
she
returned
this
was
repelling
him
beforehand
indirectly
besides
what
was
he
to
do
to
tell
her
that
he
loved
her
no
doubt
she
would
decline
to
listen
to
him
or
else
she
would
feel
indignant
and
turn
him
out
of
the
house
but
he
preferred
to
submit
to
even
the
most
painful
ordeal
rather
than
run
the
horrible
risk
of
seeing
her
no
more
he
envied
pianists
for
their
talents
and
soldiers
for
their
scars
he
longed
for
a
dangerous
attack
of
sickness
hoping
in
this
way
to
make
her
take
an
interest
in
him
one
thing
caused
astonishment
to
himself
that
he
felt
in
no
way
jealous
of
arnoux
and
he
could
not
picture
her
in
his
imagination
undressed
so
natural
did
her
modesty
appear
and
so
far
did
her
sex
recede
into
a
mysterious
background
nevertheless
he
dreamed
of
the
happiness
of
living
with
her
of
theeing
and
thouing
her
of
passing
his
hand
lingeringly
over
her
or
remaining
in
a
kneeling
posture
on
the
floor
with
both
arms
clasped
round
her
waist
so
as
to
drink
in
her
soul
through
his
eyes
to
accomplish
this
it
would
be
necessary
to
conquer
fate
and
so
incapable
of
action
cursing
god
and
accusing
himself
of
being
a
coward
he
kept
moving
restlessly
within
the
confines
of
his
passion
just
as
a
prisoner
keeps
moving
about
in
his
dungeon
the
pangs
which
he
was
perpetually
enduring
were
choking
him
for
hours
he
would
remain
quite
motionless
or
else
he
would
burst
into
tears
and
one
day
when
he
had
not
the
strength
to
restrain
his
emotion
deslauriers
said
to
him
why
goodness
gracious
what
the
matter
with
you
frederick
nerves
were
unstrung
deslauriers
did
not
believe
a
word
of
it
at
the
sight
of
so
much
mental
anguish
he
felt
all
his
old
affection
reawakening
and
he
tried
to
cheer
up
his
friend
a
man
like
him
to
let
himself
be
depressed
what
folly
it
was
all
very
well
while
one
was
young
but
as
one
grows
older
it
is
only
loss
of
time
you
are
spoiling
my
frederick
for
me
i
want
him
whom
i
knew
in
bygone
days
the
same
boy
as
ever
i
liked
him
come
smoke
a
pipe
old
chap
shake
yourself
up
a
little
you
drive
me
mad
it
is
true
said
frederick
i
am
a
fool
the
clerk
replied
ah
old
troubadour
i
know
well
what
troubling
you
a
little
affair
of
the
heart
confess
it
bah
one
lost
four
found
instead
we
console
ourselves
for
virtuous
women
with
the
other
sort
would
you
like
me
to
introduce
you
to
some
women
you
have
only
to
come
to
the
alhambra
this
was
a
place
for
public
balls
recently
opened
at
the
top
of
the
which
had
gone
down
owing
to
a
display
of
licentiousness
somewhat
ruder
than
is
usual
in
establishments
of
the
kind
that
a
place
where
there
seems
to
be
good
fun
you
can
take
your
friends
if
you
like
i
can
even
pass
in
regimbart
for
you
frederick
did
not
think
fit
to
ask
the
citizen
to
go
deslauriers
deprived
himself
of
the
pleasure
of
sénécal
society
they
took
only
hussonnet
and
cisy
along
with
dussardier
and
the
same
set
the
group
of
five
down
at
the
entrance
of
the
alhambra
two
moorish
galleries
extended
on
the
right
and
on
the
left
parallel
to
one
another
the
wall
of
a
house
opposite
occupied
the
entire
backguard
and
the
fourth
side
that
in
which
the
restaurant
was
represented
a
gothic
cloister
with
windows
a
sort
of
chinese
roof
screened
the
platform
reserved
for
the
musicians
the
ground
was
covered
all
over
with
asphalt
the
venetian
lanterns
fastened
to
posts
formed
at
regular
intervals
crowns
of
flame
above
the
heads
of
the
dancers
a
pedestal
here
and
there
supported
a
stone
basin
from
which
rose
a
thin
streamlet
of
water
in
the
midst
of
the
foliage
could
be
seen
plaster
statues
and
hebes
and
cupid
painted
in
oil
and
presenting
a
very
sticky
appearance
and
the
numerous
walks
garnished
with
sand
of
a
deep
yellow
carefully
raked
made
the
garden
look
much
larger
than
it
was
in
reality
students
were
walking
their
mistresses
up
and
down
drapers
clerks
strutted
about
with
canes
in
their
hands
lads
fresh
from
college
were
smoking
their
regalias
old
men
had
their
dyed
beards
smoothed
out
with
combs
there
were
english
russians
men
from
south
america
and
three
orientals
in
tarbooshes
lorettes
grisettes
and
girls
of
the
town
had
come
there
in
the
hope
of
finding
a
protector
a
lover
a
gold
coin
or
simply
for
the
pleasure
of
dancing
and
their
dresses
with
tunics
of
or
violet
swept
along
fluttered
between
the
and
the
lilacs
nearly
all
the
men
clothes
were
of
striped
material
some
of
them
had
white
trousers
in
spite
of
the
coolness
of
the
evening
the
gas
was
lighted
hussonnet
was
acquainted
with
a
number
of
the
women
through
his
connection
with
the
and
the
smaller
theatres
he
sent
them
kisses
with
the
tips
of
his
fingers
and
from
time
to
time
he
quitted
his
friends
to
go
and
chat
with
them
deslauriers
felt
jealous
of
these
playful
familiarities
he
accosted
in
a
cynical
manner
a
tall
girl
in
a
nankeen
costume
after
looking
at
him
with
a
certain
air
of
sullenness
she
said
no
i
would
trust
you
my
good
fellow
and
turned
on
her
heel
his
next
attack
was
on
a
stout
brunette
who
apparently
was
a
little
mad
for
she
gave
a
bounce
at
the
very
first
word
he
spoke
to
her
threatening
if
he
went
any
further
to
call
the
police
deslauriers
made
an
effort
to
laugh
then
coming
across
a
little
woman
sitting
by
herself
under
a
he
asked
her
to
be
his
partner
in
a
quadrille
the
musicians
perched
on
the
platform
in
the
attitude
of
apes
kept
scraping
and
blowing
away
with
desperate
energy
the
conductor
standing
up
kept
beating
time
automatically
the
dancers
were
much
crowded
and
enjoyed
themselves
thoroughly
the
getting
loose
rubbed
against
the
cravats
the
boots
sank
under
the
petticoats
and
all
this
bouncing
went
on
to
the
accompaniment
of
the
music
deslauriers
hugged
the
little
woman
and
seized
with
the
delirium
of
the
cancan
whirled
about
like
a
big
marionnette
in
the
midst
of
the
dancers
cisy
and
deslauriers
were
still
promenading
up
and
down
the
young
aristocrat
kept
ogling
the
girls
and
in
spite
of
the
clerk
exhortations
did
not
venture
to
talk
to
them
having
an
idea
in
his
head
that
in
the
resorts
of
these
women
there
was
always
a
man
hidden
in
the
cupboard
with
a
pistol
who
would
come
out
of
it
and
force
you
to
sign
a
bill
of
exchange
they
came
back
and
joined
frederick
deslauriers
had
stopped
dancing
and
they
were
all
asking
themselves
how
they
were
to
finish
up
the
evening
when
hussonnet
exclaimed
look
here
the
marquise
the
person
referred
to
was
a
pale
woman
with
a
nose
mittens
up
to
her
elbows
and
big
black
earrings
hanging
down
her
cheeks
like
two
dog
ears
hussonnet
said
to
her
we
ought
to
organise
a
little
fête
at
your
house
a
sort
of
oriental
rout
try
to
collect
some
of
your
friends
here
for
these
french
cavaliers
well
what
is
annoying
you
are
you
going
to
wait
for
your
hidalgo
the
andalusian
hung
down
her
head
being
well
aware
of
the
by
no
means
lavish
habits
of
her
friend
she
was
afraid
of
having
to
pay
for
any
refreshments
he
ordered
when
at
length
she
let
the
word
money
slip
from
her
cisy
offered
five
napoleons
all
he
had
in
his
purse
and
so
it
was
settled
that
the
thing
should
come
off
but
frederick
was
absent
he
fancied
that
he
had
recognised
the
voice
of
arnoux
and
got
a
glimpse
of
a
woman
hat
and
accordingly
he
hastened
towards
an
arbour
which
was
not
far
off
mademoiselle
vatnaz
was
alone
there
with
arnoux
excuse
me
i
am
in
the
way
not
in
the
least
returned
the
frederick
from
the
closing
words
of
their
conversation
understood
that
arnoux
had
come
to
the
alhambra
to
talk
over
a
pressing
matter
of
business
with
mademoiselle
vatnaz
and
it
was
evident
that
he
was
not
completely
reassured
for
he
said
to
her
with
some
uneasiness
in
his
manner
you
are
quite
sure
perfectly
certain
you
are
loved
ah
what
a
man
you
are
and
she
assumed
a
pouting
look
putting
out
her
big
lips
so
red
that
they
seemed
tinged
with
blood
but
she
had
wonderful
eyes
of
a
tawny
hue
with
specks
of
gold
in
the
pupils
full
of
vivacity
amorousness
and
sensuality
they
illuminated
like
lamps
the
rather
yellow
tint
of
her
thin
face
arnoux
seemed
to
enjoy
her
exhibition
of
pique
he
stooped
over
her
saying
you
are
nice
give
me
a
kiss
she
caught
hold
of
his
two
ears
and
pressed
her
lips
against
his
forehead
at
that
moment
the
dancing
stopped
and
in
the
conductor
place
appeared
a
handsome
young
man
rather
fat
with
a
waxen
complexion
he
had
long
black
hair
which
he
wore
in
the
same
fashion
as
christ
and
a
blue
velvet
waistcoat
embroidered
with
large
gold
he
looked
as
proud
as
a
peacock
and
as
stupid
as
a
and
having
bowed
to
the
audience
he
began
a
ditty
a
villager
was
supposed
to
be
giving
an
account
of
his
journey
to
the
capital
the
singer
used
the
dialect
of
lower
normandy
and
played
the
part
of
a
drunken
man
the
refrain
ah
i
laughed
at
you
there
i
laughed
at
you
there
in
that
rascally
city
of
paris
was
greeted
with
enthusiastic
stampings
of
feet
delmas
a
vocalist
who
sang
with
expression
was
too
shrewd
to
let
the
excitement
of
his
listeners
cool
a
guitar
was
quickly
handed
to
him
and
he
moaned
forth
a
ballad
entitled
the
albanian
girl
brother
footnote
ri
ri
dans
ce
gueusard
de
paris
the
words
recalled
to
frederick
those
which
had
been
sung
by
the
man
in
rags
between
the
of
the
steamboat
his
eyes
involuntarily
attached
themselves
to
the
hem
of
the
dress
spread
out
before
him
after
each
couplet
there
was
a
long
pause
and
the
blowing
of
the
wind
through
the
trees
resembled
the
sound
of
the
waves
mademoiselle
vatnaz
blushed
the
moment
she
saw
dussardier
she
soon
rose
and
stretching
out
her
hand
towards
him
you
do
not
remember
me
monsieur
auguste
how
do
you
know
her
asked
frederick
we
have
been
in
the
same
house
he
replied
cisy
pulled
him
by
the
sleeve
they
went
out
and
scarcely
had
they
disappeared
when
madame
vatnaz
began
to
pronounce
a
eulogy
on
his
character
she
even
went
so
far
as
to
add
that
he
possessed
the
genius
of
the
heart
then
they
chatted
about
delmas
admitting
that
as
a
mimic
he
might
be
a
success
on
the
stage
and
a
discussion
followed
in
which
shakespeare
the
censorship
style
the
people
the
receipts
of
the
porte
alexandre
dumas
victor
hugo
and
dumersan
were
all
mixed
up
together
arnoux
had
known
many
celebrated
actresses
the
young
men
bent
forward
their
heads
to
hear
what
he
had
to
say
about
these
ladies
but
his
words
were
drowned
in
the
noise
of
the
music
and
as
soon
as
the
quadrille
or
the
polka
was
over
they
all
squatted
round
the
tables
called
the
waiter
and
laughed
bottles
of
beer
and
of
effervescent
lemonade
went
off
with
detonations
amid
the
foliage
women
clucked
like
hens
now
and
then
two
gentlemen
tried
to
fight
and
a
thief
was
arrested
the
dancers
in
the
rush
of
a
gallop
encroached
on
the
walks
panting
with
flushed
smiling
faces
they
filed
off
in
a
whirlwind
which
lifted
up
the
gowns
with
the
the
trombones
brayed
more
loudly
the
rhythmic
movement
became
more
rapid
behind
the
mediæval
cloister
could
be
heard
crackling
sounds
squibs
went
off
artificial
suns
began
turning
round
the
gleam
of
the
bengal
fires
like
emeralds
in
colour
lighted
up
for
the
space
of
a
minute
the
entire
garden
and
with
the
last
rocket
a
great
sigh
escaped
from
the
assembled
throng
it
slowly
died
away
a
cloud
of
gunpowder
floated
into
the
air
frederick
and
deslauriers
were
walking
step
by
step
through
the
midst
of
the
crowd
when
they
happened
to
see
something
that
made
them
suddenly
stop
martinon
was
in
the
act
of
paying
some
money
at
the
place
where
umbrellas
were
left
and
he
was
accompanying
a
woman
of
fifty
magnificently
dressed
and
of
problematic
social
rank
that
sly
dog
said
deslauriers
is
not
so
simple
as
we
imagine
but
where
in
the
world
is
cisy
dussardier
pointed
out
to
them
the
where
they
perceived
the
knightly
youth
with
a
bowl
of
punch
before
him
and
a
pink
hat
by
his
side
to
keep
him
company
hussonnet
who
had
been
away
for
the
past
few
minutes
reappeared
at
the
same
moment
a
young
girl
was
leaning
on
his
arm
and
addressing
him
in
a
loud
voice
as
my
little
cat
oh
no
said
he
to
her
not
in
public
call
me
rather
that
gives
you
a
cavalier
style
louis
xiii
and
dainty
boots
the
sort
of
thing
i
like
yes
my
good
friends
one
of
the
old
nice
is
she
and
he
chucked
her
by
the
chin
salute
these
gentlemen
they
are
all
the
sons
of
peers
of
france
i
keep
company
with
them
in
order
that
they
may
get
an
appointment
for
me
as
an
ambassador
how
insane
you
are
sighed
mademoiselle
vatnaz
she
asked
dussardier
to
see
her
as
far
as
her
own
door
arnoux
watched
them
going
off
then
turning
towards
frederick
did
you
like
the
vatnaz
at
any
rate
you
not
quite
frank
about
these
affairs
i
believe
you
keep
your
amours
hidden
frederick
turning
pale
swore
that
he
kept
nothing
hidden
can
it
be
possible
you
do
know
what
it
is
to
have
a
mistress
said
arnoux
frederick
felt
a
longing
to
mention
a
woman
name
at
random
but
the
story
might
be
repeated
to
her
so
he
replied
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
had
no
mistress
the
reproached
him
for
this
this
evening
you
had
a
good
opportunity
why
did
you
do
like
the
others
each
of
whom
went
off
with
a
woman
well
and
what
about
yourself
said
frederick
provoked
by
his
persistency
oh
myself
that
quite
a
different
matter
my
lad
i
go
home
to
my
own
one
then
he
called
a
cab
and
disappeared
the
two
friends
walked
towards
their
own
destination
an
east
wind
was
blowing
they
did
not
exchange
a
word
deslauriers
was
regretting
that
he
had
not
succeeded
in
making
a
before
a
certain
and
frederick
was
lost
once
more
in
his
melancholy
broodings
at
length
breaking
silence
he
said
that
this
ball
appeared
to
him
a
stupid
affair
whose
fault
is
it
if
you
had
not
left
us
to
join
that
arnoux
of
yours
bah
anything
i
could
have
done
would
have
been
utterly
useless
but
the
clerk
had
theories
of
his
own
all
that
was
necessary
in
order
to
get
a
thing
was
to
desire
it
strongly
nevertheless
you
yourself
a
little
while
ago
i
do
care
a
straw
about
that
sort
of
thing
returned
deslauriers
cutting
short
frederick
allusion
am
i
going
to
get
entangled
with
women
and
he
declaimed
against
their
affectations
their
silly
ways
in
short
he
disliked
them
do
be
acting
then
said
frederick
deslauriers
became
silent
then
all
at
once
will
you
bet
me
a
hundred
francs
that
i
wo
the
first
woman
that
passes
yes
it
a
bet
the
first
who
passed
was
a
and
they
were
giving
up
all
hope
of
a
chance
presenting
itself
when
in
the
middle
of
the
rue
de
rivoli
they
saw
a
tall
girl
with
a
little
bandbox
in
her
hand
deslauriers
accosted
her
under
the
arcades
she
turned
up
abruptly
by
the
tuileries
and
soon
diverged
into
the
place
du
carrousel
she
glanced
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
she
ran
after
a
deslauriers
overtook
her
he
walked
by
her
side
talking
to
her
with
expressive
gestures
at
length
she
accepted
his
arm
and
they
went
on
together
along
the
quays
then
when
they
reached
the
rising
ground
in
front
of
the
châtelet
they
kept
tramping
up
and
down
for
at
least
twenty
minutes
like
two
sailors
keeping
watch
but
all
of
a
sudden
they
passed
over
the
through
the
flower
market
and
along
the
quai
napoléon
frederick
came
up
behind
them
deslauriers
gave
him
to
understand
that
he
would
be
in
their
way
and
had
only
to
follow
his
own
example
how
much
have
you
got
still
two
hundred
sous
pieces
that
enough
good
night
to
you
frederick
was
seized
with
the
astonishment
one
feels
at
seeing
a
piece
of
foolery
coming
to
a
successful
issue
he
has
the
laugh
at
me
was
his
reflection
suppose
i
went
back
again
perhaps
deslauriers
imagined
that
he
was
envious
of
this
paltry
love
as
if
i
had
not
one
a
hundred
times
more
rare
more
noble
more
absorbing
he
felt
a
sort
of
angry
feeling
impelling
him
onward
he
arrived
in
front
of
madame
arnoux
door
none
of
the
outer
windows
belonged
to
her
apartment
nevertheless
he
remained
with
his
eyes
pasted
on
the
front
of
the
house
as
if
he
fancied
he
could
by
his
contemplation
break
open
the
walls
no
doubt
she
was
now
sunk
in
repose
tranquil
as
a
sleeping
flower
with
her
beautiful
black
hair
resting
on
the
lace
of
the
pillow
her
lips
slightly
parted
and
one
arm
under
her
head
then
arnoux
head
rose
before
him
and
he
rushed
away
to
escape
from
this
vision
the
advice
which
deslauriers
had
given
to
him
came
back
to
his
memory
it
only
filled
him
with
horror
then
he
walked
about
the
streets
in
a
vagabond
fashion
when
a
pedestrian
approached
he
tried
to
distinguish
the
face
from
time
to
time
a
ray
of
light
passed
between
his
legs
tracing
a
great
quarter
of
a
circle
on
the
pavement
and
in
the
shadow
a
man
appeared
with
his
dosser
and
his
lantern
the
wind
at
certain
points
made
the
flue
of
a
chimney
shake
distant
sounds
reached
his
ears
mingling
with
the
buzzing
in
his
brain
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
listening
to
the
indistinct
flourish
of
quadrille
music
his
movements
as
he
walked
on
kept
up
this
illusion
he
found
himself
on
the
pont
de
la
concorde
then
he
recalled
that
evening
in
the
previous
winter
when
as
he
left
her
house
for
the
first
time
he
was
forced
to
stand
still
so
rapidly
did
his
heart
beat
with
the
hopes
that
held
it
in
their
clasp
and
now
they
had
all
withered
dark
clouds
were
drifting
across
the
face
of
the
moon
he
gazed
at
it
musing
on
the
vastness
of
space
the
wretchedness
of
life
the
nothingness
of
everything
the
day
dawned
his
teeth
began
to
chatter
and
wet
with
the
morning
mist
and
bathed
in
tears
he
asked
himself
why
should
i
not
make
an
end
of
it
all
that
was
necessary
was
a
single
movement
the
weight
of
his
forehead
dragged
him
along
he
beheld
his
own
dead
body
floating
in
the
water
frederick
stooped
down
the
parapet
was
rather
wide
and
it
was
through
pure
weariness
that
he
did
not
make
the
attempt
to
leap
over
it
then
a
feeling
of
dismay
swept
over
him
he
reached
the
boulevards
once
more
and
sank
down
upon
a
seat
he
was
aroused
by
some
who
were
convinced
that
he
had
been
indulging
a
little
too
freely
he
resumed
his
walk
but
as
he
was
exceedingly
hungry
and
as
all
the
restaurants
were
closed
he
went
to
get
a
snack
at
a
tavern
by
the
after
which
thinking
it
too
soon
to
go
in
yet
he
kept
sauntering
about
the
hôtel
de
ville
till
a
quarter
past
eight
deslauriers
had
long
since
got
rid
of
his
wench
and
he
was
writing
at
the
table
in
the
middle
of
his
room
about
four
de
cisy
came
in
thanks
to
dussardier
he
had
enjoyed
the
society
of
a
lady
the
night
before
and
he
had
even
accompanied
her
home
in
the
carriage
with
her
husband
to
the
very
threshold
of
their
house
where
she
had
given
him
an
assignation
he
parted
with
her
without
even
knowing
her
name
and
what
do
you
propose
that
i
should
do
in
that
way
said
frederick
thereupon
the
young
gentleman
began
to
cudgel
his
brains
to
think
of
a
suitable
woman
he
mentioned
mademoiselle
vatnaz
the
andalusian
and
all
the
rest
at
length
with
much
circumlocution
he
stated
the
object
of
his
visit
relying
on
the
discretion
of
his
friend
he
came
to
aid
him
in
taking
an
important
step
after
which
he
might
definitely
regard
himself
as
a
man
and
frederick
showed
no
reluctance
he
told
the
story
to
deslauriers
without
relating
the
facts
with
reference
to
himself
personally
the
clerk
was
of
opinion
that
he
was
now
going
on
very
well
this
respect
for
his
advice
increased
his
good
humour
he
owed
to
that
quality
his
success
on
the
very
first
night
he
met
her
with
mademoiselle
clémence
daviou
embroideress
in
gold
for
military
outfits
the
sweetest
creature
that
ever
lived
as
slender
as
a
reed
with
large
blue
eyes
perpetually
staring
with
wonder
the
clerk
had
taken
advantage
of
her
credulity
to
such
an
extent
as
to
make
her
believe
that
he
had
been
decorated
at
their
private
conversations
he
had
his
adorned
with
a
red
ribbon
but
divested
himself
of
it
in
public
in
order
as
he
put
it
not
to
humiliate
his
master
however
he
kept
her
at
a
distance
allowed
himself
to
be
fawned
upon
like
a
pasha
and
in
a
laughing
sort
of
way
called
her
daughter
of
the
people
every
time
they
met
she
brought
him
little
bunches
of
violets
frederick
would
not
have
cared
for
a
love
affair
of
this
sort
meanwhile
whenever
they
set
forth
to
visit
pinson
or
barillot
circulating
library
he
experienced
a
feeling
of
singular
depression
frederick
did
not
realise
how
much
pain
he
had
made
deslauriers
endure
for
the
past
year
while
brushing
his
nails
before
going
out
to
dine
in
the
rue
de
choiseul
one
evening
when
from
the
commanding
position
in
which
his
balcony
stood
he
had
just
been
watching
them
as
they
went
out
together
he
saw
hussonnet
some
distance
off
on
the
pont
the
bohemian
began
calling
him
by
making
signals
towards
him
and
when
frederick
had
descended
the
five
flights
of
stairs
here
is
the
thing
it
is
next
saturday
the
madame
how
is
that
when
her
name
is
marie
and
angèle
also
no
matter
they
will
entertain
their
guests
at
their
at
i
was
told
to
give
you
due
notice
about
it
you
find
a
vehicle
at
the
at
three
so
that
makes
matters
all
right
excuse
me
for
having
disturbed
you
but
i
have
such
a
number
of
calls
to
make
frederick
had
scarcely
turned
round
when
his
placed
a
letter
in
his
hand
monsieur
and
madame
dambreuse
beg
of
monsieur
moreau
to
do
them
the
honour
to
come
and
dine
with
them
on
saturday
the
too
late
he
said
to
himself
nevertheless
he
showed
the
letter
to
deslauriers
who
exclaimed
ha
at
last
but
you
do
look
as
if
you
were
satisfied
why
after
some
little
hesitation
frederick
said
that
he
had
another
invitation
for
the
same
day
be
kind
enough
to
let
me
run
across
to
the
rue
de
choiseul
i
not
joking
i
answer
this
for
you
if
it
puts
you
about
and
the
clerk
wrote
an
acceptance
of
the
invitation
in
the
third
person
having
seen
nothing
of
the
world
save
through
the
fever
of
his
desires
he
pictured
it
to
himself
as
an
artificial
creation
discharging
its
functions
by
virtue
of
mathematical
laws
a
dinner
in
the
city
an
accidental
meeting
with
a
man
in
office
a
smile
from
a
pretty
woman
might
by
a
series
of
actions
deducing
themselves
from
one
another
have
gigantic
results
certain
parisian
were
like
those
machines
which
take
a
material
in
the
rough
and
render
it
a
hundred
times
more
valuable
he
believed
in
courtesans
advising
diplomatists
in
wealthy
marriages
brought
about
by
intrigues
in
the
cleverness
of
convicts
in
the
capacity
of
strong
men
for
getting
the
better
of
fortune
in
short
he
considered
it
so
useful
to
visit
the
dambreuses
and
talked
about
it
so
plausibly
that
frederick
was
at
a
loss
to
know
what
was
the
best
course
to
take
the
least
he
ought
to
do
as
it
was
madame
arnoux
was
to
make
her
a
present
he
naturally
thought
of
a
parasol
in
order
to
make
reparation
for
his
awkwardness
now
he
came
across
a
parasol
with
a
little
carved
ivory
handle
which
had
come
all
the
way
from
china
but
the
price
of
it
was
a
hundred
and
francs
and
he
had
not
a
sou
having
in
fact
to
live
on
the
credit
of
his
next
quarter
allowance
however
he
wished
to
get
it
he
was
determined
to
have
it
and
in
spite
of
his
repugnance
to
doing
so
he
had
recourse
to
deslauriers
deslauriers
answered
frederick
first
question
by
saying
that
he
had
no
money
i
want
some
said
frederick
i
want
some
very
badly
as
the
other
made
the
same
excuse
over
again
he
flew
into
a
passion
you
might
find
it
to
your
advantage
some
time
what
do
you
mean
by
that
oh
nothing
the
clerk
understood
he
took
the
sum
required
out
of
his
and
when
he
had
counted
out
the
money
coin
by
coin
i
am
not
asking
you
for
a
receipt
as
i
see
you
have
a
lot
of
expense
frederick
threw
himself
on
his
friend
neck
with
a
thousand
affectionate
protestations
deslauriers
received
this
display
of
emotion
frigidly
then
next
morning
noticing
the
parasol
on
the
top
of
the
piano
ah
it
was
for
that
i
will
send
it
perhaps
said
frederick
with
an
air
of
carelessness
good
fortune
was
on
his
side
for
that
evening
he
got
a
note
with
a
black
border
from
madame
dambreuse
announcing
to
him
that
she
had
lost
an
uncle
and
excusing
herself
for
having
to
defer
till
a
later
period
the
pleasure
of
making
his
acquaintance
at
two
he
reached
the
office
of
the
art
journal
instead
of
waiting
for
him
in
order
to
drive
him
in
his
carriage
arnoux
had
left
the
city
the
night
before
unable
to
resist
his
desire
to
get
some
fresh
air
every
year
it
was
his
custom
as
soon
as
the
leaves
were
budding
forth
to
start
early
in
the
morning
and
to
remain
away
several
days
making
long
journeys
across
the
fields
drinking
milk
at
the
romping
with
the
village
girls
asking
questions
about
the
harvest
and
carrying
back
home
with
him
stalks
of
salad
in
his
at
length
in
order
to
realise
a
dream
of
his
he
had
bought
a
while
frederick
was
talking
to
the
clerk
mademoiselle
vatnaz
suddenly
made
her
appearance
and
was
disappointed
at
not
seeing
arnoux
he
would
perhaps
be
remaining
away
two
days
longer
the
clerk
advised
her
to
go
there
she
could
not
go
there
to
write
a
letter
she
was
afraid
that
the
letter
might
get
lost
frederick
offered
to
be
the
bearer
of
it
himself
she
rapidly
scribbled
off
a
letter
and
implored
of
him
to
let
nobody
see
him
delivering
it
forty
minutes
afterwards
he
found
himself
at
the
house
which
was
about
a
hundred
paces
farther
away
than
the
bridge
stood
up
the
hill
the
were
hidden
by
two
rows
of
and
a
wide
lawn
descended
to
the
bank
of
the
river
the
railed
entrance
before
the
door
was
open
and
frederick
went
in
arnoux
stretched
on
the
grass
was
playing
with
a
litter
of
kittens
this
amusement
appeared
to
absorb
him
completely
mademoiselle
letter
drew
him
out
of
his
sleepy
idleness
the
deuce
the
deuce
this
is
a
bore
she
is
right
though
i
must
go
then
having
stuck
the
missive
into
his
pocket
he
showed
the
young
man
through
the
grounds
with
manifest
delight
he
pointed
out
everything
the
stable
the
the
kitchen
the
was
at
the
right
on
the
side
facing
paris
and
looked
out
on
a
floored
arbour
covered
over
with
clematis
but
presently
a
few
harmonious
notes
burst
forth
above
their
heads
madame
arnoux
fancying
that
there
was
nobody
near
was
singing
to
amuse
herself
she
executed
quavers
trills
arpeggios
there
were
long
notes
which
seemed
to
remain
suspended
in
the
air
others
fell
in
a
rushing
shower
like
the
spray
of
a
waterfall
and
her
voice
passing
out
through
the
venetian
blind
cut
its
way
through
the
deep
silence
and
rose
towards
the
blue
sky
she
ceased
all
at
once
when
and
madame
oudry
two
neighbours
presented
themselves
then
she
appeared
herself
at
the
top
of
the
steps
in
front
of
the
house
and
as
she
descended
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
foot
she
wore
little
open
shoes
of
leather
with
three
straps
crossing
each
other
so
as
to
draw
just
above
her
stockings
a
wirework
of
gold
those
who
had
been
invited
arrived
with
the
exception
of
maître
lefaucheur
an
advocate
they
were
the
same
guests
who
came
to
the
thursday
dinners
each
of
them
had
brought
some
present
dittmer
a
syrian
scarf
rosenwald
a
of
ballads
burieu
a
painting
sombary
one
of
his
own
caricatures
and
pellerin
a
representing
a
kind
of
dance
of
death
a
hideous
fantasy
the
execution
of
which
was
rather
poor
hussonnet
dispensed
with
the
formality
of
a
present
frederick
was
waiting
to
offer
his
after
the
others
she
thanked
him
very
much
for
it
thereupon
he
said
why
is
almost
a
debt
i
have
been
so
much
annoyed
at
what
pray
she
returned
i
do
understand
come
dinner
is
waiting
said
arnoux
catching
hold
of
his
arm
then
in
a
whisper
you
are
not
very
knowing
certainly
nothing
could
well
be
prettier
than
the
painted
in
at
one
end
a
nymph
of
stone
was
dipping
her
toe
in
a
basin
formed
like
a
shell
through
the
open
windows
the
entire
garden
could
be
seen
with
the
long
lawn
flanked
by
an
old
scotch
fir
stripped
bare
groups
of
flowers
swelled
it
out
in
unequal
plots
and
at
the
other
side
of
the
river
extended
in
a
wide
the
bois
de
boulogne
neuilly
sèvres
and
meudon
before
the
railed
gate
in
front
a
canoe
with
sail
outspread
was
tacking
about
they
chatted
first
about
the
view
in
front
of
them
then
about
scenery
in
general
and
they
were
beginning
to
plunge
into
discussions
when
arnoux
at
nine
ordered
the
horse
to
be
put
to
the
carriage
would
you
like
me
to
go
back
with
you
said
madame
arnoux
why
certainly
and
making
her
a
graceful
bow
you
know
well
madame
that
it
is
impossible
to
live
without
you
everyone
congratulated
her
on
having
so
good
a
husband
ah
it
is
because
i
am
not
the
only
one
she
replied
quietly
pointing
towards
her
little
daughter
then
the
conversation
having
turned
once
more
on
painting
there
was
some
talk
about
a
ruysdaél
for
which
arnoux
expected
a
big
sum
and
pellerin
asked
him
if
it
were
true
that
the
celebrated
saul
mathias
from
london
had
come
over
during
the
past
month
to
make
him
an
offer
of
thousand
francs
for
it
is
a
positive
fact
and
turning
towards
frederick
that
was
the
very
same
gentleman
i
brought
with
me
a
few
days
ago
to
the
alhambra
much
against
my
will
i
assure
you
for
these
english
are
by
no
means
amusing
companions
frederick
who
suspected
that
mademoiselle
vatnaz
letter
contained
some
reference
to
an
intrigue
was
amazed
at
the
facility
with
which
my
lord
arnoux
found
a
way
of
passing
it
off
as
a
perfectly
honourable
transaction
but
his
new
lie
which
was
quite
needless
made
the
young
man
open
his
eyes
in
speechless
astonishment
the
added
with
an
air
of
simplicity
what
the
name
of
that
young
fellow
your
friend
deslauriers
said
frederick
quickly
and
in
order
to
repair
the
injustice
which
he
felt
he
had
done
to
his
comrade
he
praised
him
as
one
who
possessed
remarkable
ability
ah
indeed
but
he
does
look
such
a
fine
fellow
as
the
other
the
clerk
in
the
frederick
bestowed
a
mental
imprecation
on
dussardier
she
would
now
be
taking
it
for
granted
that
he
associated
with
the
common
herd
then
they
began
to
talk
about
the
ornamentation
of
the
capital
the
new
districts
of
the
city
and
the
worthy
oudry
happened
to
refer
to
dambreuse
as
one
of
the
big
speculators
frederick
taking
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
make
a
good
figure
said
he
was
acquainted
with
that
gentleman
but
pellerin
launched
into
a
harangue
against
shopkeepers
he
saw
no
difference
between
them
whether
they
were
sellers
of
candles
or
of
money
then
rosenwald
and
burieu
talked
about
old
china
arnoux
chatted
with
madame
oudry
about
gardening
sombary
a
comical
character
of
the
old
school
amused
himself
by
chaffing
her
husband
referring
to
him
sometimes
as
odry
as
if
he
were
the
actor
of
that
name
and
remarking
that
he
must
be
descended
from
oudry
the
seeing
that
the
bump
of
the
animals
was
visible
on
his
forehead
he
even
wanted
to
feel
skull
but
the
latter
excused
himself
on
account
of
his
wig
and
the
dessert
ended
with
loud
bursts
of
laughter
when
they
had
taken
their
coffee
while
they
smoked
under
the
and
strolled
about
the
garden
for
some
time
they
went
out
for
a
walk
along
the
river
the
party
stopped
in
front
of
a
fishmonger
shop
where
a
man
was
washing
eels
mademoiselle
marthe
wanted
to
look
at
them
he
emptied
the
box
in
which
he
had
them
out
on
the
grass
and
the
little
girl
threw
herself
on
her
knees
in
order
to
catch
them
laughed
with
delight
and
then
began
to
scream
with
terror
they
all
got
spoiled
and
arnoux
paid
for
them
he
next
took
it
into
his
head
to
go
out
for
a
sail
in
the
cutter
one
side
of
the
horizon
was
beginning
to
assume
a
pale
aspect
while
on
the
other
side
a
wide
strip
of
orange
colour
showed
itself
in
the
sky
deepening
into
purple
at
the
summits
of
the
hills
which
were
steeped
in
shadow
madame
arnoux
seated
herself
on
a
big
stone
with
this
glittering
splendour
at
her
back
the
other
ladies
sauntered
about
here
and
there
hussonnet
at
the
lower
end
of
the
river
bank
went
making
ducks
and
drakes
over
the
water
arnoux
presently
returned
followed
by
a
long
boat
into
which
in
spite
of
the
most
prudent
remonstrances
he
packed
his
guests
the
boat
got
upset
and
they
had
to
go
ashore
again
by
this
time
were
burning
in
the
all
hung
with
chintz
and
with
branched
candlesticks
of
crystal
fixed
close
to
the
walls
mère
oudry
was
sleeping
comfortably
in
an
armchair
and
the
others
were
listening
to
lefaucheux
expatiating
on
the
glories
of
the
bar
madame
arnoux
was
sitting
by
herself
near
the
window
frederick
came
over
to
her
they
chatted
about
the
remarks
which
were
being
made
in
their
vicinity
she
admired
oratory
he
preferred
the
renown
gained
by
authors
but
she
ventured
to
suggest
it
must
give
a
man
greater
pleasure
to
move
crowds
directly
by
addressing
them
in
person
face
to
face
than
it
does
to
infuse
into
their
souls
by
his
pen
all
the
sentiments
that
animate
his
own
such
triumphs
as
these
did
not
tempt
frederick
much
as
he
had
no
ambition
then
he
broached
the
subject
of
sentimental
adventures
she
spoke
pityingly
of
the
havoc
wrought
by
passion
but
expressed
indignation
at
hypocritical
vileness
and
this
rectitude
of
spirit
harmonised
so
well
with
the
regular
beauty
of
her
face
that
it
seemed
indeed
as
if
her
physical
attractions
were
the
outcome
of
her
moral
nature
she
smiled
every
now
and
then
letting
her
eyes
rest
on
him
for
a
minute
then
he
felt
her
glances
penetrating
his
soul
like
those
great
rays
of
sunlight
which
descend
into
the
depths
of
the
water
he
loved
her
without
mental
reservation
without
any
hope
of
his
love
being
returned
unconditionally
and
in
those
silent
transports
which
were
like
outbursts
of
gratitude
he
would
fain
have
covered
her
forehead
with
a
rain
of
kisses
however
an
inspiration
from
within
carried
him
beyond
himself
he
felt
moved
by
a
longing
for
an
imperative
impulse
towards
immediate
and
all
the
stronger
from
the
fact
that
he
could
not
gratify
it
he
did
not
leave
along
with
the
rest
neither
did
hussonnet
they
were
to
go
back
in
the
carriage
and
the
vehicle
was
waiting
just
in
front
of
the
steps
when
arnoux
rushed
down
and
hurried
into
the
garden
to
gather
some
flowers
there
then
the
bouquet
having
been
tied
round
with
a
thread
as
the
stems
fell
down
unevenly
he
searched
in
his
pocket
which
was
full
of
papers
took
out
a
piece
at
random
wrapped
them
up
completed
his
handiwork
with
the
aid
of
a
strong
pin
and
then
offered
it
to
his
wife
with
a
certain
amount
of
tenderness
look
here
my
darling
excuse
me
for
having
forgotten
you
but
she
uttered
a
little
scream
the
pin
having
been
awkwardly
fixed
had
cut
her
and
she
hastened
up
to
her
room
they
waited
nearly
a
quarter
of
an
hour
for
her
at
last
she
reappeared
carried
off
marthe
and
threw
herself
into
the
carriage
and
your
bouquet
said
arnoux
no
no
it
is
not
worth
while
frederick
was
running
off
to
fetch
it
for
her
she
called
out
to
him
i
do
want
it
but
he
speedily
brought
it
to
her
saying
that
he
had
just
put
it
into
an
envelope
again
as
he
had
found
the
flowers
lying
on
the
floor
she
thrust
them
behind
the
leathern
apron
of
the
carriage
close
to
the
seat
and
off
they
started
frederick
seated
by
her
side
noticed
that
she
was
trembling
frightfully
then
when
they
had
passed
the
bridge
as
arnoux
was
turning
to
the
left
why
no
you
are
making
a
mistake
that
way
to
the
right
she
seemed
irritated
everything
annoyed
her
at
length
marthe
having
closed
her
eyes
madame
arnoux
drew
forth
the
bouquet
and
flung
it
out
through
the
then
caught
frederick
arm
making
a
sign
to
him
with
the
other
hand
to
say
nothing
about
it
after
this
she
pressed
her
handkerchief
against
her
lips
and
sat
quite
motionless
the
two
others
on
the
dickey
kept
talking
about
printing
and
about
subscribers
arnoux
who
was
driving
recklessly
lost
his
way
in
the
middle
of
the
bois
de
boulogne
then
they
plunged
into
narrow
paths
the
horse
proceeded
along
at
a
walking
pace
the
branches
of
the
trees
grazed
the
hood
frederick
could
see
nothing
of
madame
arnoux
save
her
two
eyes
in
the
shade
marthe
lay
stretched
across
her
lap
while
he
supported
the
child
head
she
is
tiring
you
said
her
mother
he
replied
no
oh
no
whirlwinds
of
dust
rose
up
slowly
they
passed
through
auteuil
all
the
houses
were
closed
up
a
here
and
there
lighted
up
the
angle
of
a
wall
then
once
more
they
were
surrounded
by
darkness
at
one
time
he
noticed
that
she
was
shedding
tears
was
this
remorse
or
passion
what
in
the
world
was
it
this
grief
of
whose
exact
nature
he
was
ignorant
interested
him
like
a
personal
matter
there
was
now
a
new
bond
between
them
as
if
in
a
sense
they
were
accomplices
and
he
said
to
her
in
the
most
caressing
voice
he
could
assume
you
are
ill
yes
a
little
she
returned
the
carriage
rolled
on
and
the
honeysuckles
and
the
syringas
trailed
over
the
garden
fences
sending
forth
puffs
of
enervating
odour
into
the
night
air
her
gown
fell
around
her
feet
in
numerous
folds
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
he
were
in
communication
with
her
entire
person
through
the
medium
of
this
child
body
which
lay
stretched
between
them
he
stooped
over
the
little
girl
and
spreading
out
her
pretty
brown
tresses
kissed
her
softly
on
the
forehead
you
are
good
said
madame
arnoux
why
because
you
are
fond
of
children
not
all
he
said
no
more
but
he
let
his
left
hand
hang
down
her
side
wide
open
fancying
that
she
would
follow
his
example
perhaps
and
that
he
would
find
her
palm
touching
his
then
he
felt
ashamed
and
withdrew
it
they
soon
reached
the
paved
street
the
carriage
went
on
more
quickly
the
number
of
vastly
increased
it
was
paris
hussonnet
in
front
of
the
jumped
down
from
his
seat
frederick
waited
till
they
were
in
the
courtyard
before
alighting
then
he
lay
in
ambush
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
de
choiseul
and
saw
arnoux
slowly
making
his
way
back
to
the
boulevards
next
morning
he
began
working
as
hard
as
ever
he
could
he
saw
himself
in
an
assize
court
on
a
winter
evening
at
the
close
of
the
advocates
speeches
when
the
jurymen
are
looking
pale
and
when
the
panting
audience
make
the
partitions
of
the
prætorium
creak
and
after
having
being
four
hours
speaking
he
was
recapitulating
all
his
proofs
feeling
with
every
phrase
with
every
word
with
every
gesture
the
chopper
of
the
guillotine
which
was
suspended
behind
him
rising
up
then
in
the
tribune
of
the
chamber
an
orator
who
bears
on
his
lips
the
safety
of
an
entire
people
drowning
his
opponents
under
his
figures
of
rhetoric
crushing
them
under
a
repartee
with
thunders
and
musical
intonations
in
his
voice
ironical
pathetic
fiery
sublime
she
would
be
there
somewhere
in
the
midst
of
the
others
hiding
beneath
her
veil
her
enthusiastic
tears
after
that
they
would
meet
again
and
he
would
be
unaffected
by
discouragements
calumnies
and
insults
if
she
would
only
say
ah
that
is
beautiful
while
drawing
her
light
hand
across
his
brow
these
images
flashed
like
on
the
horizon
of
his
life
his
intellect
thereby
excited
became
more
active
and
more
vigorous
he
buried
himself
in
study
till
the
month
of
august
and
was
successful
at
his
final
examination
deslauriers
who
had
found
it
so
troublesome
to
coach
him
once
more
for
the
second
examination
at
the
close
of
december
and
for
the
third
in
february
was
astonished
at
his
ardour
then
the
great
expectations
of
former
days
returned
in
ten
years
it
was
probable
that
frederick
would
be
deputy
in
fifteen
a
minister
why
not
with
his
patrimony
which
would
soon
come
into
his
hands
he
might
at
first
start
a
newspaper
this
would
be
the
opening
step
in
his
career
after
that
they
would
see
what
the
future
would
bring
as
for
himself
he
was
still
ambitious
of
obtaining
a
chair
in
the
law
school
and
he
sustained
his
thesis
for
the
degree
of
doctor
in
such
a
remarkable
fashion
that
it
won
for
him
the
compliments
of
the
professors
three
days
afterwards
frederick
took
his
own
degree
before
leaving
for
his
holidays
he
conceived
the
idea
of
getting
up
a
picnic
to
bring
to
a
close
their
saturday
reunions
he
displayed
the
utmost
gaiety
on
the
occasion
madame
arnoux
was
now
with
her
mother
at
chartres
but
he
would
soon
come
across
her
again
and
would
end
by
being
her
lover
deslauriers
admitted
the
same
day
to
the
young
advocates
pleading
rehearsals
at
orsay
had
made
a
speech
which
was
greatly
applauded
although
he
was
sober
he
drank
a
little
more
wine
than
was
good
for
him
and
said
to
dussardier
at
dessert
you
are
an
honest
fellow
and
when
i
a
rich
man
i
make
you
my
manager
all
were
in
a
state
of
delight
cisy
was
not
going
to
finish
his
martinon
intended
to
remain
during
the
period
before
his
admission
to
the
bar
in
the
provinces
where
he
would
be
nominated
a
pellerin
was
devoting
himself
to
the
production
of
a
large
picture
representing
the
genius
of
the
revolution
hussonnet
was
in
the
following
week
about
to
read
for
the
director
of
public
amusements
the
scheme
of
a
play
and
had
no
doubt
as
to
its
success
as
for
the
framework
of
the
drama
they
may
leave
that
to
me
as
for
the
passions
i
have
knocked
about
enough
to
understand
them
thoroughly
and
as
for
witticisms
they
entirely
in
my
line
he
gave
a
spring
fell
on
his
two
hands
and
thus
moved
for
some
time
around
the
table
with
his
legs
in
the
air
this
performance
worthy
of
a
did
not
get
rid
of
sénécal
frowns
he
had
just
been
dismissed
from
the
in
which
he
had
been
a
teacher
for
having
given
a
whipping
to
an
aristocrat
son
his
straitened
circumstances
had
got
worse
in
consequence
he
laid
the
blame
of
this
on
the
inequalities
of
society
and
cursed
the
wealthy
he
poured
out
his
grievances
into
the
sympathetic
ears
of
regimbart
who
had
become
every
day
more
and
more
disillusioned
saddened
and
disgusted
the
citizen
had
now
turned
his
attention
towards
questions
arising
out
of
the
budget
and
blamed
the
court
party
for
the
loss
of
millions
in
algeria
as
he
could
not
sleep
without
having
paid
a
visit
to
the
alexandre
he
disappeared
at
eleven
the
rest
went
away
some
time
afterwards
and
frederick
as
he
was
parting
with
hussonnet
learned
that
madame
arnoux
was
to
have
come
back
the
night
before
he
accordingly
went
to
the
to
change
his
time
for
starting
to
the
next
day
and
at
about
six
in
the
evening
presented
himself
at
her
house
her
return
the
door
keeper
said
had
been
put
off
for
a
week
frederick
dined
alone
and
then
lounged
about
the
boulevards
rosy
clouds
in
form
stretched
beyond
the
roofs
the
were
beginning
to
be
taken
away
were
letting
a
shower
of
spray
fall
over
the
dusty
pavement
and
an
unexpected
coolness
was
mingled
with
emanations
from
cafés
as
one
got
a
glimpse
through
their
open
doors
between
some
silver
plate
and
gilt
ware
of
flowers
in
sheaves
which
were
reflected
in
the
large
sheets
of
glass
the
crowd
moved
on
at
a
leisurely
pace
groups
of
men
were
chatting
in
the
middle
of
the
footpath
and
women
passed
along
with
an
indolent
expression
in
their
eyes
and
that
camelia
tint
in
their
complexions
which
intense
heat
imparts
to
feminine
flesh
something
immeasurable
in
its
vastness
seemed
to
pour
itself
out
and
enclose
the
houses
never
had
paris
looked
so
beautiful
he
saw
nothing
before
him
in
the
future
but
an
interminable
series
of
years
all
full
of
love
he
stopped
in
front
of
the
theatre
of
the
porte
to
look
at
the
bill
and
for
want
of
something
to
occupy
him
paid
for
a
seat
and
went
in
an
dramatic
version
of
a
was
the
piece
on
the
stage
there
was
a
very
small
audience
and
through
the
skylights
of
the
top
gallery
the
vault
of
heaven
seemed
cut
up
into
little
blue
squares
whilst
the
stage
lamps
above
the
orchestra
formed
a
single
line
of
yellow
illuminations
the
scene
represented
a
at
pekin
with
tomtoms
sweeping
robes
caps
and
clownish
jokes
then
as
soon
as
the
curtain
fell
he
wandered
into
the
foyer
all
alone
and
gazed
out
with
admiration
at
a
large
green
landau
which
stood
on
the
boulevard
outside
before
the
front
steps
of
the
theatre
yoked
to
two
white
horses
while
a
coachman
with
short
breeches
held
the
reins
he
had
just
got
back
to
his
seat
when
in
the
balcony
a
lady
and
a
gentleman
entered
the
first
box
in
front
of
the
stage
the
husband
had
a
pale
face
with
a
narrow
strip
of
grey
beard
round
it
the
rosette
of
a
government
official
and
that
frigid
look
which
is
supposed
to
characterise
diplomatists
his
wife
who
was
at
least
twenty
years
younger
and
who
was
neither
tall
nor
neither
ugly
nor
pretty
wore
her
fair
hair
in
corkscrew
curls
in
the
english
fashion
and
displayed
a
dress
and
a
large
black
lace
fan
to
make
people
so
fashionable
as
these
come
to
the
theatre
at
such
a
season
one
would
imagine
either
that
there
was
some
accidental
cause
or
that
they
had
got
tired
of
spending
the
evening
in
one
another
society
the
lady
kept
nibbling
at
her
fan
while
the
gentleman
yawned
frederick
could
not
recall
to
mind
where
he
had
seen
that
face
in
the
next
interval
between
the
acts
while
passing
through
one
of
the
lobbies
he
came
face
to
face
with
both
of
them
as
he
bowed
in
an
undecided
manner
dambreuse
at
once
recognising
him
came
up
and
apologised
for
having
treated
him
with
unpardonable
neglect
it
was
an
allusion
to
the
numerous
he
had
sent
in
accordance
with
the
clerk
advice
however
he
confused
the
periods
supposing
that
frederick
was
in
the
second
year
of
his
then
he
said
he
envied
the
young
man
for
the
opportunity
of
going
into
the
country
he
sadly
needed
a
little
rest
himself
but
business
kept
him
in
paris
madame
dambreuse
leaning
on
his
arm
nodded
her
head
slightly
and
the
agreeable
sprightliness
of
her
face
contrasted
with
its
gloomy
expression
a
short
time
before
one
finds
charming
diversions
in
it
nevertheless
she
said
after
her
husband
last
remark
what
a
stupid
play
that
was
was
it
not
monsieur
and
all
three
of
them
remained
there
chatting
about
theatres
and
new
pieces
frederick
accustomed
to
the
grimaces
of
provincial
dames
had
not
seen
in
any
woman
such
ease
of
manner
combined
with
that
simplicity
which
is
the
essence
of
refinement
and
in
which
ingenuous
souls
trace
the
expression
of
instantaneous
sympathy
they
would
expect
to
see
him
as
soon
as
he
returned
dambreuse
told
him
to
give
his
kind
remembrances
to
père
roque
frederick
when
he
reached
his
lodgings
did
not
fail
to
inform
deslauriers
of
their
hospitable
invitation
grand
was
the
clerk
reply
and
do
let
your
mamma
get
round
you
come
back
without
delay
on
the
day
after
his
arrival
as
soon
as
they
had
finished
breakfast
madame
moreau
brought
her
son
out
into
the
garden
she
said
she
was
happy
to
see
him
in
a
profession
for
they
were
not
as
rich
as
people
imagined
the
land
brought
in
little
the
people
who
farmed
it
paid
badly
she
had
even
been
compelled
to
sell
her
carriage
finally
she
placed
their
situation
in
its
true
colours
before
him
during
the
first
embarrassments
which
followed
the
death
of
her
late
husband
roque
a
man
of
great
cunning
had
made
her
loans
of
money
which
had
been
renewed
and
left
long
unpaid
in
spite
of
her
desire
to
clear
them
off
he
had
suddenly
made
a
demand
for
immediate
payment
and
she
had
gone
beyond
the
strict
terms
of
the
agreement
by
giving
up
to
him
at
a
contemptible
figure
the
farm
of
presles
ten
years
later
her
capital
disappeared
through
the
failure
of
a
banker
at
melun
through
a
horror
which
she
had
of
mortgages
and
to
keep
up
appearances
which
might
be
necessary
in
view
of
her
son
future
she
had
when
père
roque
presented
himself
again
listened
to
him
once
more
but
now
she
was
free
from
debt
in
short
there
was
left
them
an
income
of
about
ten
thousand
francs
of
which
two
thousand
three
hundred
belonged
to
him
his
entire
patrimony
it
is
possible
exclaimed
frederick
she
nodded
her
head
as
if
to
declare
that
it
was
perfectly
possible
but
his
uncle
would
leave
him
something
that
was
by
no
means
certain
and
they
took
a
turn
around
the
garden
without
exchanging
a
word
at
last
she
pressed
him
to
her
heart
and
in
a
voice
choked
with
rising
tears
ah
my
poor
boy
i
have
had
to
give
up
my
dreams
he
seated
himself
on
a
bench
in
the
shadow
of
the
large
acacia
her
advice
was
that
he
should
become
a
clerk
to
prouharam
solicitor
who
would
assign
over
his
office
to
him
if
he
increased
its
value
he
might
sell
it
again
and
find
a
good
practice
frederick
was
no
longer
listening
to
her
he
was
gazing
automatically
across
the
hedge
into
the
other
garden
opposite
a
little
girl
of
about
twelve
with
red
hair
happened
to
be
there
all
alone
she
had
made
earrings
for
herself
with
the
berries
of
the
her
bodice
made
of
grey
allowed
her
shoulders
slightly
gilded
by
the
sun
to
be
seen
her
short
white
petticoat
was
spotted
with
the
stains
made
by
sweets
and
there
was
so
to
speak
the
grace
of
a
young
wild
animal
about
her
entire
person
at
the
same
time
nervous
and
thin
apparently
the
presence
of
a
stranger
astonished
her
for
she
had
stopped
abruptly
with
her
in
her
hand
darting
glances
at
him
with
her
large
bright
eyes
which
were
of
a
limpid
colour
that
is
roque
daughter
said
madame
moreau
he
has
just
married
his
servant
and
legitimised
the
child
that
he
had
by
her
chapter
vi
blighted
hopes
ruined
stripped
of
everything
undermined
he
remained
seated
on
the
bench
as
if
stunned
by
a
shock
he
cursed
fate
he
would
have
liked
to
beat
somebody
and
to
intensify
his
despair
he
felt
a
kind
of
outrage
a
sense
of
disgrace
weighing
down
upon
him
for
frederick
had
been
under
the
impression
that
the
fortune
coming
to
him
through
his
father
would
mount
up
one
day
to
an
income
of
fifteen
thousand
livres
and
he
had
so
informed
the
arnoux
in
an
indirect
sort
of
way
so
then
he
would
be
looked
upon
as
a
braggart
a
rogue
an
obscure
blackguard
who
had
introduced
himself
to
them
in
the
expectation
of
making
some
profit
out
of
it
and
as
for
her
madame
arnoux
how
could
he
ever
see
her
again
now
moreover
that
was
completely
impossible
when
he
had
only
a
yearly
income
of
three
thousand
francs
he
could
not
always
lodge
on
the
fourth
floor
have
the
door
keeper
as
a
servant
and
make
his
appearance
with
wretched
black
gloves
turning
blue
at
the
ends
a
greasy
hat
and
the
same
for
a
whole
year
no
no
never
and
yet
without
her
existence
was
intolerable
many
people
were
well
able
to
live
without
any
fortune
deslauriers
amongst
the
rest
and
he
thought
himself
a
coward
to
attach
so
much
importance
to
matters
of
trifling
consequence
need
would
perhaps
multiply
his
faculties
a
hundredfold
he
excited
himself
by
thinking
on
the
great
men
who
had
worked
in
garrets
a
soul
like
that
of
madame
arnoux
ought
to
be
touched
at
such
a
spectacle
and
she
would
be
moved
by
it
to
sympathetic
tenderness
so
after
all
this
catastrophe
was
a
piece
of
good
fortune
like
those
earthquakes
which
unveil
treasures
it
had
revealed
to
him
the
hidden
wealth
of
his
nature
but
there
was
only
one
place
in
the
world
where
this
could
be
turned
to
account
paris
for
to
his
mind
art
science
and
love
those
three
faces
of
god
as
pellerin
would
have
said
were
associated
exclusively
with
the
capital
that
evening
he
informed
his
mother
of
his
intention
to
go
back
there
madame
moreau
was
surprised
and
indignant
she
regarded
it
as
a
foolish
and
absurd
course
it
would
be
better
to
follow
her
advice
namely
to
remain
near
her
in
an
office
frederick
shrugged
his
shoulders
come
now
looking
on
this
proposal
as
an
insult
to
himself
thereupon
the
good
lady
adopted
another
plan
in
a
tender
voice
broken
by
sobs
she
began
to
dwell
on
her
solitude
her
old
age
and
the
sacrifices
she
had
made
for
him
now
that
she
was
more
unhappy
than
ever
he
was
abandoning
her
then
alluding
to
the
anticipated
close
of
her
life
a
little
patience
good
heavens
you
will
soon
be
free
these
lamentations
were
renewed
twenty
times
a
day
for
three
months
and
at
the
same
time
the
luxuries
of
a
home
made
him
effeminate
he
found
it
enjoyable
to
have
a
softer
bed
and
napkins
that
were
not
torn
so
that
weary
enervated
overcome
by
the
terrible
force
of
comfort
frederick
allowed
himself
to
be
brought
to
maître
prouharam
office
he
displayed
there
neither
knowledge
nor
aptitude
up
to
this
time
he
had
been
regarded
as
a
young
man
of
great
means
who
ought
to
be
the
shining
light
of
the
department
the
public
would
now
come
to
the
conclusion
that
he
had
imposed
upon
them
at
first
he
said
to
himself
it
is
necessary
to
inform
madame
arnoux
about
it
and
for
a
whole
week
he
kept
formulating
in
his
own
mind
dithyrambic
letters
and
short
notes
in
an
eloquent
and
sublime
style
the
fear
of
avowing
his
actual
position
restrained
him
then
he
thought
that
it
was
far
better
to
write
to
the
husband
arnoux
knew
life
and
could
understand
the
true
state
of
the
case
at
length
after
a
fortnight
hesitation
bah
i
ought
not
to
see
them
any
more
let
them
forget
me
at
any
rate
i
shall
be
cherished
in
her
memory
without
having
sunk
in
her
estimation
she
will
believe
that
i
am
dead
and
will
regret
me
perhaps
as
extravagant
resolutions
cost
him
little
he
swore
in
his
own
mind
that
he
would
never
return
to
paris
and
that
he
would
not
even
make
any
enquiries
about
madame
arnoux
nevertheless
he
regretted
the
very
smell
of
the
gas
and
the
noise
of
the
omnibuses
he
mused
on
the
things
that
she
might
have
said
to
him
on
the
tone
of
her
voice
on
the
light
of
her
eyes
and
regarding
himself
as
a
dead
man
he
no
longer
did
anything
at
all
he
arose
very
late
and
looked
through
the
window
at
the
passing
teams
of
wagoners
the
first
six
months
especially
were
hateful
on
certain
days
however
he
was
possessed
by
a
feeling
of
indignation
even
against
her
then
he
would
go
forth
and
wander
through
the
meadows
half
covered
in
winter
time
by
the
inundations
of
the
seine
they
were
cut
up
by
rows
of
here
and
there
arose
a
little
bridge
he
tramped
about
till
evening
rolling
the
yellow
leaves
under
his
feet
inhaling
the
fog
and
jumping
over
the
ditches
as
his
arteries
began
to
throb
more
vigorously
he
felt
himself
carried
away
by
a
desire
to
do
something
wild
he
longed
to
become
a
trapper
in
america
to
attend
on
a
pasha
in
the
east
to
take
ship
as
a
sailor
and
he
gave
vent
to
his
melancholy
in
long
letters
to
deslauriers
the
latter
was
struggling
to
get
on
the
slothful
conduct
of
his
friend
and
his
eternal
jeremiads
appeared
to
him
simply
stupid
their
correspondence
soon
became
a
mere
form
frederick
had
given
up
all
his
furniture
to
deslauriers
who
stayed
on
in
the
same
lodgings
from
time
to
time
his
mother
spoke
to
him
at
length
he
one
day
told
her
about
the
present
he
had
made
and
she
was
giving
him
a
rating
for
it
when
a
letter
was
placed
in
his
hands
what
is
the
matter
now
she
said
you
are
trembling
there
is
nothing
the
matter
with
me
replied
frederick
deslauriers
informed
him
that
he
had
taken
sénécal
under
his
protection
and
that
for
the
past
fortnight
they
had
been
living
together
so
now
sénécal
was
exhibiting
himself
in
the
midst
of
things
that
had
come
from
the
arnoux
shop
he
might
sell
them
criticise
make
jokes
about
them
frederick
felt
wounded
in
the
depths
of
his
soul
he
went
up
to
his
own
apartment
he
felt
a
yearning
for
death
his
mother
called
him
to
consult
him
about
a
plantation
in
the
garden
this
garden
was
after
the
fashion
of
an
english
park
cut
in
the
middle
by
a
stick
fence
and
the
half
of
it
belonged
to
père
roque
who
had
another
for
vegetables
on
the
bank
of
the
river
the
two
neighbours
having
fallen
out
abstained
from
making
their
appearance
there
at
the
same
hour
but
since
frederick
return
the
old
gentleman
used
to
walk
about
there
more
frequently
and
was
not
stinted
in
his
courtesies
towards
madame
moreau
son
he
pitied
the
young
man
for
having
to
live
in
a
country
town
one
day
he
told
him
that
madame
dambreuse
had
been
anxious
to
hear
from
him
on
another
occasion
he
expatiated
on
the
custom
of
champagne
where
the
stomach
conferred
nobility
at
that
time
you
would
have
been
a
lord
since
your
mother
name
was
de
fouvens
and
is
all
very
well
to
talk
never
mind
something
in
a
name
after
all
he
added
with
a
sly
glance
at
frederick
that
depends
on
the
keeper
of
the
seals
this
pretension
to
aristocracy
contrasted
strangely
with
his
personal
appearance
as
he
was
small
his
big
exaggerated
the
length
of
his
bust
when
he
took
off
his
hat
a
face
almost
like
that
of
a
woman
with
an
extremely
sharp
nose
could
be
seen
his
hair
which
was
of
a
yellow
colour
resembled
a
wig
he
saluted
people
with
a
very
low
bow
brushing
against
the
wall
up
to
his
fiftieth
year
he
had
been
content
with
the
services
of
catherine
a
native
of
lorraine
of
the
same
age
as
himself
who
was
strongly
marked
with
but
in
the
year
he
brought
back
with
him
from
paris
a
handsome
blonde
with
a
type
of
countenance
and
a
queenly
carriage
ere
long
she
was
observed
strutting
about
with
large
earrings
and
everything
was
explained
by
the
birth
of
a
daughter
who
was
introduced
to
the
world
under
the
name
of
elisabeth
olympe
louise
roque
catherine
in
her
first
ebullition
of
jealousy
expected
that
she
would
curse
this
child
on
the
contrary
she
became
fond
of
the
little
girl
and
treated
her
with
the
utmost
care
consideration
and
tenderness
in
order
to
supplant
her
mother
and
render
her
odious
an
easy
task
inasmuch
as
madame
éléonore
entirely
neglected
the
little
one
preferring
to
gossip
at
the
tradesmen
shops
on
the
day
after
her
marriage
she
went
to
pay
a
visit
at
the
no
longer
thee
and
thou
the
servants
and
took
it
into
her
head
that
as
a
matter
of
good
form
she
ought
to
exhibit
a
certain
severity
towards
the
child
she
was
present
while
the
little
one
was
at
her
lessons
the
teacher
an
old
clerk
who
had
been
employed
at
the
mayor
office
did
not
know
how
to
go
about
the
work
of
instructing
the
girl
the
pupil
rebelled
got
her
ears
boxed
and
rushed
away
to
shed
tears
on
the
lap
of
catherine
who
always
took
her
part
after
this
the
two
women
wrangled
and
roque
ordered
them
to
hold
their
tongues
he
had
married
only
out
of
tender
regard
for
his
daughter
and
did
not
wish
to
be
annoyed
by
them
she
often
wore
a
white
dress
with
ribbons
and
pantalettes
trimmed
with
lace
and
on
great
she
would
leave
the
house
attired
like
a
princess
in
order
to
mortify
a
little
the
matrons
of
the
town
who
forbade
their
brats
to
associate
with
her
on
account
of
her
illegitimate
birth
she
passed
her
life
nearly
always
by
herself
in
the
garden
went
on
the
swing
chased
butterflies
then
suddenly
stopped
to
watch
the
floral
beetles
swooping
down
on
the
it
was
no
doubt
these
habits
which
imparted
to
her
face
an
expression
at
the
same
time
of
audacity
and
dreaminess
she
had
moreover
a
figure
like
marthe
so
that
frederick
said
to
her
at
their
second
interview
will
you
permit
me
to
kiss
you
mademoiselle
the
little
girl
lifted
up
her
head
and
replied
i
will
but
the
separated
them
from
one
another
we
must
climb
over
said
frederick
no
lift
me
up
he
stooped
over
the
hedge
and
raising
her
off
the
ground
with
his
hands
kissed
her
on
both
cheeks
then
he
put
her
back
on
her
own
side
by
a
similar
process
and
this
performance
was
repeated
on
the
next
occasions
when
they
found
themselves
together
without
more
reserve
than
a
child
of
four
as
soon
as
she
heard
her
friend
coming
she
sprang
forward
to
meet
him
or
else
hiding
behind
a
tree
she
began
yelping
like
a
dog
to
frighten
him
one
day
when
madame
moreau
had
gone
out
he
brought
her
up
to
his
own
room
she
opened
all
the
and
pomaded
her
hair
plentifully
then
without
the
slightest
embarrassment
she
lay
down
on
the
bed
where
she
remained
stretched
out
at
full
length
wide
awake
i
fancy
myself
your
wife
she
said
to
him
next
day
he
found
her
all
in
tears
she
confessed
that
she
had
been
weeping
for
her
sins
and
when
he
wished
to
know
what
they
were
she
hung
down
her
head
and
answered
ask
me
no
more
the
time
for
first
communion
was
at
hand
she
had
been
brought
to
confession
in
the
morning
the
sacrament
scarcely
made
her
wiser
occasionally
she
got
into
a
real
passion
and
frederick
was
sent
for
to
appease
her
he
often
brought
her
with
him
in
his
walks
while
he
indulged
in
as
he
walked
along
she
would
gather
wild
poppies
at
the
edges
of
the
and
when
she
saw
him
more
melancholy
than
usual
she
tried
to
console
him
with
her
pretty
childish
prattle
his
heart
bereft
of
love
fell
back
on
this
friendship
inspired
by
a
little
girl
he
gave
her
sketches
of
old
fogies
told
her
stories
and
devoted
himself
to
reading
books
for
her
he
began
with
the
a
collection
of
prose
and
verse
celebrated
at
the
period
then
forgetting
her
age
so
much
was
he
charmed
by
her
intelligence
he
read
for
her
in
succession
and
feuilles
but
one
night
she
had
that
very
evening
heard
in
letourneur
simple
translation
she
woke
up
exclaiming
the
spot
the
spot
her
teeth
chattered
she
shivered
and
fixing
terrified
glances
on
her
right
hand
she
kept
rubbing
it
saying
always
a
spot
at
last
a
doctor
was
brought
who
directed
that
she
should
be
kept
free
from
violent
emotions
the
townsfolk
saw
in
this
only
an
unfavourable
prognostic
for
her
morals
it
was
said
that
young
moreau
wished
to
make
an
actress
of
her
later
soon
another
event
became
the
subject
of
discussion
namely
the
arrival
of
uncle
barthélemy
madame
moreau
gave
up
her
to
him
and
was
so
gracious
as
to
serve
up
meat
to
him
on
the
old
man
was
not
very
agreeable
he
was
perpetually
making
comparisons
between
havre
and
nogent
the
air
of
which
he
considered
heavy
the
bread
bad
the
streets
the
food
indifferent
and
the
inhabitants
very
lazy
how
wretched
trade
is
with
you
in
this
place
he
blamed
his
deceased
brother
for
his
extravagance
pointing
out
by
way
of
contrast
that
he
had
himself
accumulated
an
income
of
thousand
livres
a
year
at
last
he
left
at
the
end
of
the
week
and
on
the
footboard
of
the
carriage
gave
utterance
to
these
by
no
means
reassuring
words
i
am
always
very
glad
to
know
that
you
are
in
a
good
position
you
will
get
nothing
said
madame
moreau
as
they
the
he
had
come
only
at
her
urgent
request
and
for
eight
days
she
had
been
seeking
on
her
part
for
an
opening
only
too
clearly
perhaps
she
repented
now
of
having
done
so
and
remained
seated
in
her
armchair
with
her
head
bent
down
and
her
lips
tightly
pressed
together
frederick
sat
opposite
staring
at
her
and
they
were
both
silent
as
they
had
been
five
years
before
on
his
return
home
by
the
montereau
steamboat
this
coincidence
which
presented
itself
even
to
her
mind
recalled
madame
arnoux
to
his
recollection
at
that
moment
the
crack
of
a
whip
outside
the
window
reached
their
ears
while
a
voice
was
heard
calling
out
to
him
it
was
père
roque
who
was
alone
in
his
tilted
cart
he
was
going
to
spend
the
whole
day
at
la
fortelle
with
dambreuse
and
cordially
offered
to
drive
frederick
there
you
have
no
need
of
an
invitation
as
long
as
you
are
with
me
do
be
afraid
frederick
felt
inclined
to
accept
this
offer
but
how
would
he
explain
his
fixed
sojourn
at
nogent
he
had
not
a
proper
summer
suit
finally
what
would
his
mother
say
he
accordingly
decided
not
to
go
from
that
time
their
neighbour
exhibited
less
friendliness
louise
was
growing
tall
madame
éléonore
fell
dangerously
ill
and
the
intimacy
broke
off
to
the
great
delight
of
madame
moreau
who
feared
lest
her
son
prospects
of
being
settled
in
life
might
be
affected
by
association
with
such
people
she
was
thinking
of
purchasing
for
him
the
registrarship
of
the
court
of
justice
frederick
raised
no
particular
objection
to
this
scheme
he
now
accompanied
her
to
mass
in
the
evening
he
took
a
hand
in
a
game
of
all
fours
he
became
accustomed
to
provincial
habits
of
life
and
allowed
himself
to
slide
into
them
and
even
his
love
had
assumed
a
character
of
mournful
sweetness
a
kind
of
soporific
charm
by
dint
of
having
poured
out
his
grief
in
his
letters
mixed
it
up
with
everything
he
read
given
full
vent
to
it
during
his
walks
through
the
country
he
had
almost
exhausted
it
so
that
madame
arnoux
was
for
him
as
it
were
a
dead
woman
whose
tomb
he
wondered
that
he
did
not
know
so
tranquil
and
resigned
had
his
affection
for
her
now
become
one
day
the
of
december
about
nine
in
the
morning
the
cook
brought
up
a
letter
to
his
room
the
address
which
was
in
big
characters
was
written
in
a
hand
he
was
not
acquainted
with
and
frederick
feeling
sleepy
was
in
no
great
hurry
to
break
the
seal
at
length
when
he
did
so
he
read
justice
of
the
peace
at
havre
arrondissement
monsieur
monsieur
moreau
your
uncle
having
died
intestate
he
had
fallen
in
for
the
inheritance
as
if
a
conflagration
had
burst
out
behind
the
wall
he
jumped
out
of
bed
in
his
shirt
with
his
feet
bare
he
passed
his
hand
over
his
face
doubting
the
evidence
of
his
own
eyes
believing
that
he
was
still
dreaming
and
in
order
to
make
his
mind
more
clearly
conscious
of
the
reality
of
the
event
he
flung
the
window
wide
open
there
had
been
a
fall
of
snow
the
roofs
were
white
and
he
even
recognised
in
the
yard
outside
a
washtub
which
had
caused
him
to
stumble
after
dark
the
evening
before
he
read
the
letter
over
three
times
in
succession
could
there
be
anything
more
certain
his
uncle
entire
fortune
a
yearly
income
of
thousand
livres
and
he
was
overwhelmed
with
frantic
joy
at
the
idea
of
seeing
madame
arnoux
once
more
with
the
vividness
of
a
hallucination
he
saw
himself
beside
her
at
her
house
bringing
her
some
present
in
silver
paper
while
at
the
door
stood
a
tilbury
no
a
brougham
rather
a
black
brougham
with
a
servant
in
brown
livery
he
could
hear
his
horse
pawing
the
ground
and
the
noise
of
the
mingling
with
the
rippling
sound
of
their
kisses
and
every
day
this
was
renewed
indefinitely
he
would
receive
them
in
his
own
house
the
would
be
furnished
in
red
leather
the
boudoir
in
yellow
silk
sofas
everywhere
and
such
a
variety
of
whatnots
china
vases
and
carpets
these
images
came
in
so
tumultuous
a
fashion
into
his
mind
that
he
felt
his
head
turning
round
then
he
thought
of
his
mother
and
he
descended
the
stairs
with
the
letter
in
his
hand
footnote
about
translator
madame
moreau
made
an
effort
to
control
her
emotion
but
could
not
keep
herself
from
swooning
frederick
caught
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
on
the
forehead
dear
mother
you
can
now
buy
back
your
carriage
laugh
then
shed
no
more
tears
be
happy
illustration
laugh
then
shed
no
more
tears
be
happy
ten
minutes
later
the
news
had
travelled
as
far
as
the
faubourgs
then
benoist
gamblin
chambion
and
other
friends
hurried
towards
the
house
frederick
got
away
for
a
minute
in
order
to
write
to
deslauriers
then
other
visitors
turned
up
the
afternoon
passed
in
congratulations
they
had
forgotten
all
about
roque
wife
who
however
was
declared
to
be
very
low
when
they
were
alone
the
same
evening
madame
moreau
said
to
her
son
that
she
would
advise
him
to
set
up
as
an
advocate
at
troyes
as
he
was
better
known
in
his
own
part
of
the
country
than
in
any
other
he
might
more
easily
find
there
a
profitable
connection
ah
it
is
too
hard
exclaimed
frederick
he
had
scarcely
grasped
his
good
fortune
in
his
hands
when
he
longed
to
carry
it
to
madame
arnoux
he
announced
his
express
determination
to
live
in
paris
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
there
nothing
madame
moreau
astonished
at
his
manner
asked
what
he
intended
to
become
a
minister
was
frederick
reply
and
he
declared
that
he
was
not
at
all
joking
that
he
meant
to
plunge
at
once
into
diplomacy
and
that
his
studies
and
his
instincts
impelled
him
in
that
direction
he
would
first
enter
the
council
of
state
under
dambreuse
patronage
so
then
you
know
him
oh
yes
through
m
roque
that
is
singular
said
madame
moreau
he
had
awakened
in
her
heart
her
former
dreams
of
ambition
she
internally
abandoned
herself
to
them
and
said
no
more
about
other
matters
if
he
had
yielded
to
his
impatience
frederick
would
have
started
that
very
instant
next
morning
every
seat
in
the
diligence
had
been
engaged
and
so
he
kept
eating
out
his
heart
till
seven
in
the
evening
they
had
sat
down
to
dinner
when
three
prolonged
tolls
of
the
fell
on
their
ears
and
the
housemaid
coming
in
informed
them
that
madame
éléonore
had
just
died
this
death
after
all
was
not
a
misfortune
for
anyone
not
even
for
her
child
the
young
girl
would
only
find
it
all
the
better
for
herself
afterwards
as
the
two
houses
were
close
to
one
another
a
great
coming
and
going
and
a
clatter
of
tongues
could
be
heard
and
the
idea
of
this
corpse
being
so
near
them
threw
a
certain
funereal
gloom
over
their
parting
madame
moreau
wiped
her
eyes
two
or
three
times
frederick
felt
his
heart
oppressed
when
the
meal
was
over
catherine
stopped
him
between
two
doors
mademoiselle
had
peremptorily
expressed
a
wish
to
see
him
she
was
waiting
for
him
in
the
garden
he
went
out
there
strode
over
the
hedge
and
knocking
more
or
less
against
the
trees
directed
his
steps
towards
roque
house
lights
were
glittering
through
a
window
in
the
second
story
then
a
form
appeared
in
the
midst
of
the
darkness
and
a
voice
whispered
is
i
she
seemed
to
him
taller
than
usual
owing
to
her
black
dress
no
doubt
not
knowing
what
to
say
to
her
he
contented
himself
with
catching
her
hands
and
sighing
forth
ah
my
poor
louise
she
did
not
reply
she
gazed
at
him
for
a
long
time
with
a
look
of
sad
deep
earnestness
frederick
was
afraid
of
missing
the
coach
he
fancied
that
he
could
hear
the
rolling
of
wheels
some
distance
away
and
in
order
to
put
an
end
to
the
interview
without
any
delay
catherine
told
me
that
you
had
something
yes
is
true
i
wanted
to
tell
you
he
was
astonished
to
find
that
she
addressed
him
in
the
plural
and
as
she
again
relapsed
into
silence
well
what
i
do
know
i
forget
is
it
true
that
you
going
away
yes
i
starting
just
now
she
repeated
ah
just
now
for
good
we
never
see
one
another
again
she
was
choking
with
sobs
embrace
me
then
and
she
threw
her
arms
about
him
passionately
chapter
vii
a
change
of
fortune
then
he
had
taken
his
place
behind
the
other
passengers
in
the
front
of
the
diligence
and
when
the
vehicle
began
to
shake
as
the
five
horses
started
into
a
brisk
trot
all
at
the
same
time
he
allowed
himself
to
plunge
into
an
intoxicating
dream
of
the
future
like
an
architect
drawing
up
the
plan
of
a
palace
he
mapped
out
his
life
beforehand
he
filled
it
with
dainties
and
with
splendours
it
rose
up
to
the
sky
a
profuse
display
of
allurements
could
be
seen
there
and
so
deeply
was
he
buried
in
the
contemplation
of
these
things
that
he
lost
sight
of
all
external
objects
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
of
sourdun
his
attention
was
directed
to
the
stage
which
they
had
reached
in
their
journey
they
had
travelled
only
about
five
kilometres
at
the
most
he
was
annoyed
at
this
tardy
rate
of
travelling
he
pulled
down
the
in
order
to
get
a
view
of
the
road
he
asked
the
conductor
several
times
at
what
hour
they
would
reach
their
destination
however
he
eventually
regained
his
composure
and
remained
seated
in
his
corner
of
the
vehicle
with
eyes
wide
open
footnote
a
little
over
three
translator
the
lantern
which
hung
from
the
postilion
seat
threw
its
light
on
the
buttocks
of
the
in
front
only
the
manes
of
the
other
horses
could
be
seen
undulating
like
white
billows
their
breathing
caused
a
kind
of
fog
to
gather
at
each
side
of
the
team
the
little
iron
chains
of
the
harness
rang
the
windows
shook
in
their
sashes
and
the
heavy
coach
went
rolling
at
an
even
pace
over
the
pavement
here
and
there
could
be
distinguished
the
wall
of
a
barn
or
else
an
inn
standing
by
itself
sometimes
as
they
entered
a
village
a
baker
oven
threw
out
gleams
of
light
and
the
gigantic
silhouettes
of
the
horses
kept
rushing
past
the
walls
of
the
opposite
houses
at
every
change
of
horses
when
the
harness
was
unfastened
there
was
a
great
silence
for
a
minute
overhead
under
the
awning
some
passenger
might
be
heard
tapping
with
his
feet
while
a
woman
sitting
at
the
threshold
of
the
door
screened
her
candle
with
her
hand
then
the
conductor
would
jump
on
the
footboard
and
the
vehicle
would
start
on
its
way
again
at
mormans
the
striking
of
the
clocks
announced
that
it
was
a
quarter
past
one
so
then
we
are
in
another
day
he
thought
we
have
been
in
it
for
some
time
but
gradually
his
hopes
and
his
recollections
nogent
the
rue
de
choiseul
madame
arnoux
and
his
mother
all
got
mixed
up
together
he
was
awakened
by
the
dull
sound
of
wheels
passing
over
planks
they
were
crossing
the
pont
de
charenton
it
was
paris
then
his
two
travelling
companions
the
first
taking
off
his
cap
and
the
second
his
silk
handkerchief
put
on
their
hats
and
began
to
chat
the
first
a
big
man
in
a
velvet
was
a
merchant
the
second
was
coming
up
to
the
capital
to
consult
a
physician
and
fearing
that
he
had
disturbed
this
gentleman
during
the
night
frederick
spontaneously
apologised
to
him
so
much
had
the
young
man
heart
been
softened
by
the
feelings
of
happiness
that
possessed
it
the
wharf
of
the
wet
dock
being
flooded
no
doubt
they
went
straight
ahead
and
once
more
they
could
see
green
fields
in
the
distance
tall
were
sending
forth
their
smoke
then
they
turned
into
ivry
then
drove
up
a
street
all
at
once
he
saw
before
him
the
dome
of
the
panthéon
the
plain
quite
broken
up
seemed
a
waste
of
ruins
the
enclosing
wall
of
the
fortifications
made
a
horizontal
swelling
there
and
on
the
footpath
on
the
ground
at
the
side
of
the
road
little
branchless
trees
were
protected
by
laths
bristling
with
nails
establishments
for
chemical
products
and
yards
made
their
appearance
alternately
high
gates
like
those
seen
in
afforded
glimpses
through
their
opening
leaves
of
wretched
yards
within
full
of
filth
with
puddles
of
dirty
water
in
the
middle
of
them
long
of
the
colour
of
ox
blood
displayed
in
the
first
floor
between
the
windows
two
crossing
one
another
with
a
wreath
of
painted
flowers
here
and
there
might
be
noticed
a
plaster
hut
which
had
been
allowed
to
remain
unfinished
then
the
double
row
of
houses
was
no
longer
interrupted
and
over
their
bare
fronts
enormous
tin
cigars
showed
themselves
at
some
distance
from
each
other
indicating
tobacconists
shops
midwives
signboards
represented
in
each
case
a
matron
in
a
cap
rocking
a
doll
under
a
counterpane
trimmed
with
lace
the
corners
of
the
walls
were
covered
with
placards
which
torn
were
quivering
in
the
wind
like
rags
workmen
in
blouses
brewers
drays
laundresses
and
butchers
carts
passed
along
a
thin
rain
was
falling
it
was
cold
there
was
a
pale
sky
but
two
eyes
which
to
him
were
as
precious
as
the
sun
were
shining
behind
the
haze
they
had
to
wait
a
long
time
at
the
barrier
for
vendors
of
poultry
wagoners
and
a
flock
of
sheep
caused
an
obstruction
there
the
sentry
with
his
thrown
back
walked
to
and
fro
in
front
of
his
box
to
keep
himself
warm
the
clerk
who
collected
the
clambered
up
to
the
roof
of
the
diligence
and
a
sent
forth
a
flourish
they
went
down
the
boulevard
at
a
quick
trot
the
clapping
and
the
traces
hanging
loose
the
lash
of
the
whip
went
cracking
through
the
moist
air
the
conductor
uttered
his
sonorous
shout
look
alive
look
alive
oho
and
the
scavengers
drew
out
of
the
way
the
pedestrians
sprang
back
the
mud
gushed
against
the
they
crossed
cabs
and
omnibuses
at
length
the
iron
gate
of
the
jardin
des
plantes
came
into
sight
the
seine
which
was
of
a
yellowish
colour
almost
reached
the
platforms
of
the
bridges
a
cool
breath
of
air
issued
from
it
frederick
inhaled
it
with
his
utmost
energy
drinking
in
this
good
air
of
paris
which
seems
to
contain
the
effluvia
of
love
and
the
emanations
of
the
intellect
he
was
touched
with
emotion
at
the
first
glimpse
of
a
he
gazed
with
delight
on
the
thresholds
of
the
shops
garnished
with
straw
on
the
with
their
boxes
on
the
lads
who
sold
groceries
as
they
shook
their
women
hurried
along
at
a
with
umbrellas
over
their
heads
he
bent
forward
to
try
whether
he
could
distinguish
their
faces
chance
might
have
led
madame
arnoux
to
come
out
the
shops
displayed
their
wares
the
crowd
grew
denser
the
noise
in
the
streets
grew
louder
after
passing
the
quai
the
quai
de
la
tournelle
and
the
quai
montebello
they
drove
along
the
quai
napoléon
he
was
anxious
to
see
the
windows
there
but
they
were
too
far
away
from
him
then
they
once
more
crossed
the
seine
over
the
and
descended
in
the
direction
of
the
louvre
and
having
traversed
the
rues
croix
des
and
du
bouloi
he
reached
the
rue
and
entered
the
courtyard
of
the
hotel
to
make
his
enjoyment
last
the
longer
frederick
dressed
himself
as
slowly
as
possible
and
even
walked
as
far
as
the
boulevard
montmartre
he
smiled
at
the
thought
of
presently
beholding
once
more
the
beloved
name
on
the
marble
plate
he
cast
a
glance
upwards
there
was
no
longer
a
trace
of
the
display
in
the
windows
the
pictures
or
anything
else
he
hastened
to
the
rue
de
choiseul
and
madame
arnoux
no
longer
resided
there
and
a
woman
next
door
was
keeping
an
eye
on
the
lodge
frederick
waited
to
see
the
porter
himself
after
some
time
he
made
his
appearance
it
was
no
longer
the
same
man
he
did
not
know
their
address
frederick
went
into
a
café
and
while
at
breakfast
consulted
the
commercial
directory
there
were
three
hundred
arnoux
in
it
but
no
jacques
arnoux
where
then
were
they
living
pellerin
ought
to
know
he
made
his
way
to
the
very
top
of
the
faubourg
poissonnière
to
the
artist
studio
as
the
door
had
neither
a
bell
nor
a
knocker
he
rapped
loudly
on
it
with
his
knuckles
and
then
called
out
shouted
but
the
only
response
was
the
echo
of
his
voice
from
the
empty
house
after
this
he
thought
of
hussonnet
but
where
could
he
discover
a
man
of
that
sort
on
one
occasion
he
had
waited
on
hussonnet
when
the
latter
was
paying
a
visit
to
his
mistress
house
in
the
rue
de
fleurus
frederick
had
just
reached
the
rue
de
fleurus
when
he
became
conscious
of
the
fact
that
he
did
not
even
know
the
lady
name
he
had
recourse
to
the
prefecture
of
police
he
wandered
from
staircase
to
staircase
from
office
to
office
he
found
that
the
intelligence
department
was
closed
for
the
day
and
was
told
to
come
back
again
next
morning
then
he
called
at
all
the
shops
that
he
could
discover
and
enquired
whether
they
could
give
him
any
information
as
to
whereabouts
the
only
answer
he
got
was
that
arnoux
was
no
longer
in
the
trade
at
last
discouraged
weary
sickened
he
returned
to
his
hotel
and
went
to
bed
just
as
he
was
stretching
himself
between
the
sheets
an
idea
flashed
upon
him
which
made
him
leap
up
with
delight
regimbart
what
an
idiot
i
was
not
to
think
of
him
before
next
morning
at
seven
he
arrived
in
the
rue
nôtre
dame
des
victoires
in
front
of
a
where
regimbart
was
in
the
habit
of
drinking
white
wine
it
was
not
yet
open
he
walked
about
the
neighbourhood
and
at
the
end
of
about
presented
himself
at
the
place
once
more
regimbart
had
left
it
frederick
rushed
out
into
the
street
he
fancied
that
he
could
even
notice
regimbart
hat
some
distance
away
a
hearse
and
some
mourning
coaches
intercepted
his
progress
when
they
had
got
out
of
the
way
the
vision
had
disappeared
fortunately
he
recalled
to
mind
that
the
citizen
breakfasted
every
day
at
eleven
sharp
at
a
little
restaurant
in
the
place
gaillon
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
wait
patiently
till
then
and
after
sauntering
about
from
the
bourse
to
the
madeleine
and
from
the
madeleine
to
the
gymnase
so
long
that
it
seemed
as
if
it
would
never
come
to
an
end
frederick
just
as
the
clocks
were
striking
eleven
entered
the
restaurant
in
the
rue
gaillon
certain
of
finding
regimbart
there
do
know
said
the
in
an
unceremonious
tone
frederick
persisted
the
man
replied
i
have
no
longer
any
acquaintance
with
him
monsieur
and
as
he
spoke
he
raised
his
eyebrows
majestically
and
shook
his
head
in
a
mysterious
fashion
but
in
their
last
interview
the
citizen
had
referred
to
the
alexandre
frederick
swallowed
a
cake
jumped
into
a
cab
and
asked
the
driver
whether
there
happened
to
be
anywhere
on
the
heights
of
a
certain
café
alexandre
the
cabman
drove
him
to
the
rue
des
francs
bourgeois
where
there
was
an
establishment
of
that
name
and
in
answer
to
his
question
regimbart
if
you
please
the
keeper
of
the
café
said
with
an
unusually
gracious
smile
we
have
not
seen
him
as
yet
monsieur
while
he
directed
towards
his
wife
who
sat
behind
the
counter
a
look
of
intelligence
and
the
next
moment
turning
towards
the
clock
but
he
be
here
i
hope
in
ten
minutes
or
at
most
a
quarter
of
an
hour
celestin
hurry
with
the
newspapers
what
would
monsieur
like
to
take
though
he
did
not
want
to
take
anything
frederick
swallowed
a
glass
of
rum
then
a
glass
of
kirsch
then
a
glass
of
curaçoa
then
several
glasses
of
grog
both
cold
and
hot
he
read
through
that
day
and
then
read
it
over
again
he
examined
the
caricatures
in
the
down
to
the
very
tissue
of
the
paper
when
he
had
finished
he
knew
the
advertisements
by
heart
from
time
to
time
the
tramp
of
boots
on
the
footpath
outside
reached
his
ears
it
was
he
and
some
one
form
would
trace
its
outlines
on
the
but
it
invariably
passed
on
in
order
to
get
rid
of
the
sense
of
weariness
he
experienced
frederick
shifted
his
seat
he
took
up
his
position
at
the
lower
end
of
the
room
then
at
the
right
after
that
at
the
left
and
he
remained
in
the
middle
of
the
bench
with
his
arms
stretched
out
but
a
cat
daintily
pressing
down
the
velvet
at
the
back
of
the
seat
startled
him
by
giving
a
sudden
spring
in
order
to
lick
up
the
spots
of
syrup
on
the
tray
and
the
child
of
the
house
an
insufferable
brat
of
four
played
noisily
with
a
rattle
on
the
bar
steps
his
mother
a
little
woman
with
decayed
teeth
was
smiling
in
a
stupid
sort
of
way
what
in
the
world
could
regimbart
be
doing
frederick
waited
for
him
in
an
exceedingly
miserable
frame
of
mind
the
rain
clattered
like
hail
on
the
covering
of
the
cab
through
the
opening
in
the
muslin
curtain
he
could
see
the
poor
horse
in
the
street
more
motionless
than
a
horse
made
of
wood
the
stream
of
water
becoming
enormous
trickled
down
between
two
spokes
of
the
wheels
and
the
coachman
was
nodding
drowsily
with
the
horsecloth
wrapped
round
him
for
protection
but
fearing
lest
his
fare
might
give
him
the
slip
he
opened
the
door
every
now
and
then
with
the
rain
dripping
from
him
as
if
falling
from
a
mountain
torrent
and
if
things
could
get
worn
out
by
looking
at
them
the
clock
ought
to
have
by
this
time
been
utterly
dissolved
so
frequently
did
frederick
rivet
his
eyes
on
it
however
it
kept
going
mine
host
alexandre
walked
up
and
down
repeating
come
cheer
up
he
come
and
in
order
to
divert
his
thoughts
talked
politics
holding
forth
at
some
length
he
even
carried
civility
so
far
as
to
propose
a
game
of
dominoes
at
length
when
it
was
four
frederick
who
had
been
there
since
about
twelve
sprang
to
his
feet
and
declared
that
he
would
not
wait
any
longer
i
ca
understand
it
at
all
myself
replied
the
in
a
tone
of
straightforwardness
this
is
the
first
time
that
ledoux
has
failed
to
come
what
monsieur
ledoux
why
yes
monsieur
i
said
regimbart
exclaimed
frederick
exasperated
ah
a
thousand
pardons
you
are
making
a
mistake
madame
alexandre
did
not
monsieur
say
m
ledoux
and
questioning
the
waiter
you
heard
him
yourself
just
as
i
did
no
doubt
to
pay
his
master
off
for
old
scores
the
waiter
contented
himself
with
smiling
frederick
drove
back
to
the
boulevards
indignant
at
having
his
time
wasted
raging
against
the
citizen
but
craving
for
his
presence
as
if
for
that
of
a
god
and
firmly
resolved
to
drag
him
forth
if
necessary
from
the
depths
of
the
most
remote
cellars
the
vehicle
in
which
he
was
driving
only
irritated
him
the
more
and
he
accordingly
got
rid
of
it
his
ideas
were
in
a
state
of
confusion
then
all
the
names
of
the
cafés
which
he
had
heard
pronounced
by
that
idiot
burst
forth
at
the
same
time
from
his
memory
like
the
thousand
pieces
of
an
exhibition
of
fireworks
the
café
gascard
the
café
grimbert
the
café
halbout
the
bordelais
the
havanais
the
havrais
the
boeuf
à
la
mode
the
brasserie
allemande
and
the
mère
morel
and
he
made
his
way
to
all
of
them
in
succession
but
in
one
he
was
told
that
regimbart
had
just
gone
out
in
another
that
he
might
perhaps
call
at
a
later
hour
in
a
third
that
they
had
not
seen
him
for
six
months
and
in
another
place
that
he
had
the
day
before
ordered
a
leg
of
mutton
for
saturday
finally
at
vautier
frederick
on
opening
the
door
knocked
against
the
waiter
do
you
know
m
regimbart
what
monsieur
do
i
know
him
is
i
who
have
the
honour
of
attending
on
him
he
upstairs
he
is
just
finishing
his
dinner
and
with
a
napkin
under
his
arm
the
master
of
the
establishment
himself
accosted
him
you
asking
him
for
regimbart
monsieur
he
was
here
a
moment
ago
frederick
gave
vent
to
an
oath
but
the
proprietor
of
the
stated
that
he
would
find
the
gentleman
as
a
matter
of
certainty
at
bouttevilain
i
assure
you
on
my
honour
he
left
a
little
earlier
than
usual
for
he
had
a
business
appointment
with
some
gentlemen
but
you
find
him
i
tell
you
again
at
bouttevilain
in
the
rue
no
the
second
row
of
steps
at
the
left
at
the
end
of
the
courtyard
first
floor
door
to
the
right
at
last
he
saw
regimbart
in
a
cloud
of
by
himself
at
the
lower
end
of
the
near
the
with
a
glass
of
beer
in
front
of
him
and
his
chin
lowered
in
a
thoughtful
attitude
ah
i
have
been
a
long
time
searching
for
you
without
rising
regimbart
extended
towards
him
only
two
fingers
and
as
if
he
had
seen
frederick
the
day
before
he
gave
utterance
to
a
number
of
commonplace
remarks
about
the
opening
of
the
session
frederick
interrupted
him
saying
in
the
most
natural
tone
he
could
assume
is
arnoux
going
on
well
the
reply
was
a
long
time
coming
as
regimbart
was
gargling
the
liquor
in
his
throat
yes
not
badly
where
is
he
living
now
why
in
the
rue
paradis
poissonnière
the
citizen
returned
with
astonishment
what
number
confound
it
what
a
funny
fellow
you
are
frederick
rose
what
are
you
going
yes
yes
i
have
to
make
a
call
some
business
matter
i
had
forgotten
frederick
went
from
the
to
the
arnoux
residence
as
if
carried
along
by
a
tepid
wind
with
a
sensation
of
extreme
ease
such
as
people
experience
in
dreams
he
found
himself
soon
on
the
second
floor
in
front
of
a
door
at
the
ringing
of
whose
bell
a
servant
appeared
a
second
door
was
flung
open
madame
arnoux
was
seated
near
the
fire
arnoux
jumped
up
and
rushed
across
to
embrace
frederick
she
had
on
her
lap
a
little
boy
not
quite
three
years
old
her
daughter
now
as
tall
as
herself
was
standing
up
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
mantelpiece
allow
me
to
present
this
gentleman
to
you
said
arnoux
taking
his
son
up
in
his
arms
and
he
amused
himself
for
some
minutes
in
making
the
child
jump
up
in
the
air
very
high
and
then
catching
him
with
both
hands
as
he
came
down
you
kill
him
ah
good
heavens
have
done
exclaimed
madame
arnoux
but
arnoux
declaring
that
there
was
not
the
slightest
danger
still
kept
tossing
up
the
child
and
even
addressed
him
in
words
of
endearment
such
as
nurses
use
in
the
marseillaise
dialect
his
natal
tongue
ah
my
fine
picheoun
my
ducksy
of
a
little
nightingale
then
he
asked
frederick
why
he
had
been
so
long
without
writing
to
them
what
he
had
been
doing
down
in
the
country
and
what
brought
him
back
as
for
me
i
am
at
present
my
dear
friend
a
dealer
in
faïence
but
let
us
talk
about
yourself
frederick
gave
as
reasons
for
his
absence
a
protracted
lawsuit
and
the
state
of
his
mother
health
he
laid
special
stress
on
the
latter
subject
in
order
to
make
himself
interesting
he
ended
by
saying
that
this
time
he
was
going
to
settle
in
paris
for
good
and
he
said
nothing
about
the
inheritance
lest
it
might
be
prejudicial
to
his
past
the
curtains
like
the
upholstering
of
the
furniture
were
of
maroon
damask
wool
two
pillows
were
close
beside
one
another
on
the
bolster
on
the
a
kettle
was
boiling
and
the
shade
of
the
lamp
which
stood
near
the
edge
of
the
chest
of
drawers
darkened
the
apartment
madame
arnoux
wore
a
large
blue
merino
with
her
face
turned
towards
the
fire
and
one
hand
on
the
shoulder
of
the
little
boy
she
unfastened
with
the
other
the
child
bodice
the
youngster
in
his
shirt
began
to
cry
while
scratching
his
head
like
the
son
of
alexandre
frederick
expected
that
he
would
have
felt
spasms
of
joy
but
the
passions
grow
pale
when
we
find
ourselves
in
an
altered
situation
and
as
he
no
longer
saw
madame
arnoux
in
the
environment
wherein
he
had
known
her
she
seemed
to
him
to
have
lost
some
of
her
fascination
to
have
degenerated
in
some
way
that
he
could
not
comprehend
in
fact
not
to
be
the
same
he
was
astonished
at
the
serenity
of
his
own
heart
he
made
enquiries
about
some
old
friends
about
pellerin
amongst
others
i
do
see
him
often
said
arnoux
she
added
we
no
longer
entertain
as
we
used
to
do
formerly
was
the
object
of
this
to
let
him
know
that
he
would
get
no
invitation
from
them
but
arnoux
continuing
to
exhibit
the
same
cordiality
reproached
him
for
not
having
come
to
dine
with
them
uninvited
and
he
explained
why
he
had
changed
his
business
what
are
you
to
do
in
an
age
of
decadence
like
ours
great
painting
is
gone
out
of
fashion
besides
we
may
import
art
into
everything
you
know
that
for
my
part
i
am
a
lover
of
the
beautiful
i
must
bring
you
one
of
these
days
to
see
my
earthenware
works
and
he
wanted
to
show
frederick
immediately
some
of
his
productions
in
the
store
which
he
had
between
the
and
the
first
floor
dishes
and
encumbered
the
floor
against
the
walls
were
laid
out
large
squares
of
pavement
for
bathrooms
and
with
mythological
subjects
in
the
renaissance
style
whilst
in
the
centre
a
pair
of
whatnots
rising
up
to
the
ceiling
supported
candelabra
little
and
large
statuettes
of
many
colours
representing
a
negro
or
a
shepherdess
in
the
pompadour
fashion
frederick
who
was
cold
and
hungry
was
bored
with
arnoux
display
of
his
wares
he
hurried
off
to
the
café
anglais
where
he
ordered
a
sumptuous
supper
and
while
eating
said
to
himself
i
was
well
off
enough
below
there
with
all
my
troubles
she
scarcely
took
any
notice
of
me
how
like
a
shopkeeper
wife
and
in
an
abrupt
expansion
of
healthfulness
he
formed
egoistic
resolutions
he
felt
his
heart
as
hard
as
the
table
on
which
his
elbows
rested
so
then
he
could
by
this
time
plunge
fearlessly
into
the
vortex
of
society
the
thought
of
the
dambreuses
recurred
to
his
mind
he
would
make
use
of
them
then
he
recalled
deslauriers
to
mind
ah
faith
so
much
the
worse
nevertheless
he
sent
him
a
note
by
a
messenger
making
an
appointment
with
him
for
the
following
day
in
order
that
they
might
breakfast
together
fortune
had
not
been
so
kind
to
the
other
he
had
presented
himself
at
the
examination
for
a
fellowship
with
a
thesis
on
the
law
of
wills
in
which
he
maintained
that
the
powers
of
testators
ought
to
be
restricted
as
much
as
possible
and
as
his
adversary
provoked
him
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
him
say
foolish
things
he
gave
utterance
to
many
of
these
absurdities
without
in
any
way
inducing
the
examiners
to
falter
in
deciding
that
he
was
wrong
then
chance
so
willed
it
that
he
should
choose
by
lot
as
a
subject
for
a
lecture
prescription
thereupon
deslauriers
gave
vent
to
some
lamentable
theories
the
questions
in
dispute
in
former
times
ought
to
be
brought
forward
as
well
as
those
which
had
recently
arisen
why
should
the
proprietor
be
deprived
of
his
estate
because
he
could
furnish
his
only
after
the
lapse
of
years
this
was
giving
the
security
of
the
honest
man
to
the
inheritor
of
the
enriched
thief
every
injustice
was
consecrated
by
extending
this
law
which
was
a
form
of
tyranny
the
abuse
of
force
he
had
even
exclaimed
abolish
it
and
the
franks
will
no
longer
oppress
the
gauls
the
english
oppress
the
irish
the
yankee
oppress
the
redskins
the
turks
oppress
the
arabs
the
whites
oppress
the
blacks
poland
the
president
interrupted
him
well
well
monsieur
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
your
political
opinions
you
will
have
them
represented
in
your
behalf
deslauriers
did
not
wish
to
have
his
opinions
represented
but
this
unfortunate
title
xx
of
the
third
book
of
the
civil
code
had
become
a
sort
of
mountain
over
which
he
stumbled
he
was
elaborating
a
great
work
on
prescription
considered
as
the
basis
of
the
civil
law
and
of
the
law
of
nature
amongst
peoples
and
he
got
lost
in
dunod
rogerius
balbus
merlin
vazeille
savigny
traplong
and
other
weighty
authorities
on
the
subject
in
order
to
have
more
leisure
for
the
purpose
of
devoting
himself
to
this
task
he
had
resigned
his
post
of
he
lived
by
giving
private
tuitions
and
preparing
theses
and
at
the
meetings
of
barristers
to
rehearse
legal
arguments
he
frightened
by
his
display
of
virulence
those
who
held
conservative
views
all
the
young
doctrinaires
who
acknowledged
guizot
as
their
master
so
that
in
a
certain
set
he
had
gained
a
sort
of
celebrity
mingled
in
a
slight
degree
with
lack
of
confidence
in
him
as
an
individual
he
came
to
keep
the
appointment
in
a
big
paletot
lined
with
red
flannel
like
the
one
sénécal
used
to
wear
in
former
days
human
respect
on
account
of
the
prevented
them
from
straining
one
another
long
in
an
embrace
of
friendship
and
they
made
their
way
to
véfour
laughing
pleasantly
though
with
lingering
in
the
depths
of
their
eyes
then
as
soon
as
they
were
free
from
observation
deslauriers
exclaimed
ah
damn
it
we
have
a
jolly
time
of
it
now
frederick
was
not
quite
pleased
to
find
deslauriers
all
at
once
associating
himself
in
this
way
with
his
own
inheritance
his
friend
exhibited
too
much
pleasure
on
account
of
them
both
and
not
enough
on
his
account
alone
after
this
deslauriers
gave
details
about
the
reverse
he
had
met
with
and
gradually
told
frederick
all
about
his
occupations
and
his
daily
existence
speaking
of
himself
in
a
stoical
fashion
and
of
others
in
tones
of
intense
bitterness
he
found
fault
with
everything
there
was
not
a
man
in
office
who
was
not
an
idiot
or
a
rascal
he
flew
into
a
passion
against
the
waiter
for
having
a
glass
badly
rinsed
and
when
frederick
uttered
a
reproach
with
a
view
to
mitigating
his
wrath
as
if
i
were
going
to
annoy
myself
with
such
numbskulls
who
you
must
know
can
earn
as
much
as
six
and
even
eight
thousand
francs
a
year
who
are
electors
perhaps
eligible
as
candidates
ah
no
no
then
with
a
sprightly
air
but
i
forgotten
that
i
talking
to
a
capitalist
to
a
mondor
for
you
are
a
mondor
now
footnote
mondor
was
a
celebrated
italian
charlatan
who
in
the
seventeenth
century
settled
in
paris
and
made
a
large
translator
and
coming
back
to
the
question
of
the
inheritance
he
gave
expression
to
this
view
that
collateral
successorship
a
thing
unjust
in
itself
though
in
the
present
case
he
was
glad
it
was
possible
would
be
abolished
one
of
these
days
at
the
approaching
revolution
do
you
believe
in
that
said
frederick
be
sure
of
it
he
replied
this
sort
of
thing
can
not
last
there
is
too
much
suffering
when
i
see
into
the
wretchedness
of
men
like
sénécal
always
sénécal
thought
frederick
but
at
all
events
tell
me
the
news
are
you
still
in
love
with
madame
arnoux
is
it
all
over
eh
frederick
not
knowing
what
answer
to
give
him
closed
his
eyes
and
hung
down
his
head
with
regard
to
arnoux
deslauriers
told
him
that
the
journal
was
now
the
property
of
hussonnet
who
had
transformed
it
it
was
called
a
literary
institution
a
company
with
shares
of
one
hundred
francs
each
capital
of
the
firm
forty
thousand
francs
each
shareholder
having
the
right
to
put
into
it
his
own
contributions
for
the
company
has
for
its
object
to
publish
the
works
of
beginners
to
spare
talent
perchance
genius
the
sad
crises
which
drench
etc
you
see
the
dodge
there
was
however
something
to
be
effected
by
the
change
the
tone
of
the
journal
could
be
raised
then
without
any
delay
while
retaining
the
same
writers
and
promising
a
continuation
of
the
feuilleton
to
supply
the
subscribers
with
a
political
organ
the
amount
to
be
advanced
would
not
be
very
great
what
do
you
think
of
it
come
would
you
like
to
have
a
hand
in
it
frederick
did
not
reject
the
proposal
but
he
pointed
out
that
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
attend
to
the
regulation
of
his
affairs
after
that
if
you
require
anything
thanks
my
boy
said
deslauriers
then
they
smoked
puros
leaning
with
their
elbows
on
the
shelf
covered
with
velvet
beside
the
window
the
sun
was
shining
the
air
was
balmy
flocks

about

down
into
the
garden
the
statues

together
and
the
laughter
of
children
could
be
heard
mingling
with
the
continuous
plash
that
came
from
the
of
the
fountain
frederick
was
troubled
by
deslauriers

but
under
the
influence
of
the
wine
which
circulated
through
his
veins
in
a
state
of
torpor
with
the
sun
shining
full
on
his
face
he
was
no
longer
conscious
of
anything

a
profound
sense
of
comfort
a
kind
of
voluptuous
feeling
that
stupefied
him

saturated
with
heat

moisture
deslauriers

eyelids

staring
vacantly
into

his
breast
swelled
and
he
broke

and
he
went
on
setting
forth
his
theories
in
the
street
frederick
without
listening
to
him
was
looking
at
certain
materials
and
articles
of
furniture
in
the
which
would
be
suitable
for
his

exposed
to
view
they
were
decorated
with
yellow
arabesques
with
metallic
reflections
and
were
worth
a
hundred
crowns
apiece
he
got
them
put
by
for
my
part
if
i
were
in
your
place
said
deslauriers
i
would
rather
buy
silver
plate
revealing
by
this
love
of
substantial
things
the
man
of
mean
extraction
as
soon
as
he
was
alone
frederick
repaired
to
the
establishment
of
the
celebrated
pomadère
where
he
ordered
three
pairs
of
trousers
two
coats
a
pelisse
trimmed
with
fur
and
five
waistcoats
then
he
called
at
a
bootmaker
a
shirtmaker
and
a
hatter
giving
them
directions
in
each
shop
to
make
the
greatest
possible
haste
three
days
later
on
the
evening
of
his
return
from
havre
he
found
his
complete
wardrobe
awaiting
him
in
his
parisian
abode
and
impatient
to
make
use
of
it
he
resolved
to
pay
an
immediate
visit
to
the
dambreuses
but
it
was
too
early
yet
scarcely
eight
suppose
i
went
to
see
the
others

he
to
himself
he
came
upon
arnoux
all
alone
in
the
act
of
shaving
in
front
of
his
glass
the
latter
proposed
to
drive
him
to
a
place
where
they
could
amuse
themselves
and
when
dambreuse
was
referred
to
ah
just
lucky
you
see
some
of
his
friends
there
come
on
then
it
will
be
good
fun
frederick
asked
to
be
excused
madame
arnoux
recognised
his
voice
and
wished
him
through
the
partition
for
her
daughter
was
indisposed
and
she
was
also
rather
unwell
herself
the
noise
of
a
against
a
glass
could
be
heard
from
within
and
all
those
quivering
sounds
made
by
things
being
lightly
moved
about
which
are
usual
in
a
then
arnoux
left
his
to
say
to
his
wife
he
brought
forward
a
heap
of
reasons
for
going
out

know
well
that

is
a
serious
matter

must
go

as
he
let
himself
sink
back
in
the
cushions
ah

tired

dear
fellow

will
be
the
death
of
me
however
i
can
tell
it
to
you

he
bent
towards
frederick
ear
in
a
mysterious
fashion
i
am
trying
to
discover
again
the
red
of
chinese
copper
and
he
explained
the
nature
of
the
glaze
and
the
little
fire
on
their
arrival
at
chevet
shop
a
large
hamper
was
brought
to
him
which
he
stowed
away
in
the
then
he
bought
for
his
poor
wife
and
various
dainties
and
directed
that
they
should
be
sent
early
next
morning
after
this
they
called
at
a
costumer
establishment
it
was
to
a
ball
they
were
going
arnoux
selected
blue
velvet
breeches
a
vest
of
the
same
material
and
a
red
wig
frederick
a
domino
and
they
went
down
the
rue
de
laval
towards
a
house
the
second
floor
of
which
was
illuminated
by
coloured
lanterns
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
they
heard
violins
playing
above
where
the
deuce
are
you
bringing
me
to
said
frederick
to
see
a
nice
girl
do
be
afraid
the
door
was
opened
for
them
by
a
groom
and
they
entered
the
anteroom
where
paletots
mantles
and
shawls
were
thrown
together
in
a
heap
on
some
chairs
a
young
woman
in
the
costume
of
a
dragoon
of
louis
xiv
reign
was
passing
at
that
moment
it
was
mademoiselle
rosanette
bron
the
mistress
of
the
place
well
said
arnoux
is
done
she
replied
ah
thanks
my
angel
and
he
wanted
to
kiss
her
take
care
now
you
foolish
man
you
spoil
the
paint
on
my
face
arnoux
introduced
frederick
step
in
there
monsieur
you
are
quite
welcome
she
drew
aside
a
and
cried
out
with
a
certain
emphasis
here
my
lord
arnoux
girl
and
a
princely
friend
of
his
frederick
was
at
first
dazzled
by
the
lights
he
could
see
nothing
save
some
silk
and
velvet
dresses
naked
shoulders
a
mass
of
colours
swaying
to
and
fro
to
the
accompaniment
of
an
orchestra
hidden
behind
green
foliage
between
walls
hung
with
yellow
silk
with
pastel
portraits
here
and
there
and
crystal
chandeliers
in
the
style
of
louis
xvi
period
high
lamps
whose
globes
of
roughened
glass
resembled
snowballs
looked
down
on
baskets
of
flowers
placed
on
brackets
in
the
corners
and
at
the
opposite
side
at
the
rear
of
a
second
room
smaller
in
size
one
could
distinguish
in
a
third
a
bed
with
twisted
posts
and
at
its
head
a
venetian
mirror
the
dancing
stopped
and
there
were
bursts
of
applause
a
hubbub
of
delight
as
arnoux
was
seen
advancing
with
his
hamper
on
his
head
the
eatables
contained
in
it
made
a
lump
in
the
centre
make
way
for
the
lustre
frederick
raised
his
eyes
it
was
the
lustre
of
old
saxe
that
had
adorned
the
shop
attached
to
the
office
of
the
memory
of
former
days
was
brought
back
to
his
mind
but
a
of
the
line
in
undress
with
that
silly
expression
of
countenance
ascribed
by
tradition
to
conscripts
planted
himself
right
in
front
of
him
spreading
out
his
two
arms
in
order
to
emphasise
his
astonishment
and
in
spite
of
the
hideous
black
moustaches
unusually
pointed
which
disfigured
his
face
frederick
recognised
his
old
friend
hussonnet
in
a
kind
of
gibberish
the
bohemian
loaded
him
with
congratulations
calling
him
his
colonel
frederick
put
out
of
countenance
by
the
crowd
of
personages
assembled
around
him
was
at
a
loss
for
an
answer
at
a
tap
on
the
desk
from
a
fiddlestick
the
partners
in
the
dance
fell
into
their
places
they
were
about
sixty
in
number
the
women
being
for
the
most
part
dressed
either
as
or
marchionesses
and
the
men
who
were
nearly
all
of
mature
age
being
got
up
as
wagoners
or
sailors
frederick
having
taken
up
his
position
close
to
the
wall
stared
at
those
who
were
going
through
the
quadrille
in
front
of
him
an
old
beau
dressed
like
a
venetian
doge
in
a
long
gown
or
purple
silk
was
dancing
with
mademoiselle
rosanette
who
wore
a
green
coat
laced
breeches
and
boots
of
soft
leather
with
gold
spurs
the
pair
in
front
of
them
consisted
of
an
albanian
laden
with
yataghans
and
a
swiss
girl
with
blue
eyes
and
skin
white
as
milk
who
looked
as
plump
as
a
quail
with
her
and
red
corset
exposed
to
view
in
order
to
turn
to
account
her
hair
which
fell
down
to
her
hips
a
tall
blonde
a
walking
lady
in
the
opera
had
assumed
the
part
of
a
female
savage
and
over
her
brown
she
displayed
nothing
save
leathern
breeches
glass
bracelets
and
a
tinsel
diadem
from
which
rose
a
large
sheaf
of
peacock
feathers
in
front
of
her
a
gentleman
who
had
intended
to
represent
pritchard
muffled
up
in
a
grotesquely
big
black
coat
was
beating
time
with
his
elbows
on
his
a
little
watteau
shepherd
in
like
moonlight
dashed
his
crook
against
the
thyrsus
of
a
bacchante
crowned
with
grapes
who
wore
a
leopard
skin
over
her
left
side
and
buskins
with
gold
ribbons
on
the
other
side
a
polish
lady
in
a
spencer
of
velvet
made
her
gauze
petticoat
flutter
over
her
stockings
which
rose
above
her
fashionable
pink
boots
bordered
with
white
fur
she
was
smiling
on
a
man
of
forty
disguised
as
a
who
was
skipping
very
high
lifting
up
his
surplice
with
one
hand
and
with
the
other
his
red
clerical
cap
but
the
queen
the
star
was
mademoiselle
loulou
a
celebrated
dancer
at
public
halls
as
she
had
now
become
wealthy
she
wore
a
large
lace
collar
over
her
vest
of
smooth
black
velvet
and
her
wide
trousers
of
silk
clinging
closely
to
her
figure
and
drawn
tight
round
her
waist
by
a
cashmere
scarf
had
all
over
their
seams
little
natural
white
camellias
her
pale
face
a
little
puffed
and
with
the
nose
somewhat
looked
all
the
more
pert
from
the
disordered
appearance
of
her
wig
over
which
she
had
with
a
touch
of
her
hand
clapped
a
man
grey
felt
hat
so
that
it
covered
her
right
ear
and
with
every
bounce
she
made
her
pumps
adorned
with
diamond
buckles
nearly
reached
the
nose
of
her
neighbour
a
big
mediæval
baron
who
was
quite
entangled
in
his
steel
armour
there
was
also
an
angel
with
a
gold
sword
in
her
hand
and
two
swan
wings
over
her
back
who
kept
rushing
up
and
down
every
minute
losing
her
partner
who
appeared
as
louis
displaying
an
utter
ignorance
of
the
figures
and
confusing
the
quadrille
footnote
this
probably
refers
to
the
english
astronomer
of
that
translator
frederick
as
he
gazed
at
these
people
experienced
a
sense
of
forlornness
a
feeling
of
uneasiness
he
was
still
thinking
of
madame
arnoux
and
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
he
were
taking
part
in
some
plot
that
was
being
hatched
against
her
when
the
quadrille
was
over
mademoiselle
rosanette
accosted
him
she
was
slightly
out
of
breath
and
her
gorget
polished
like
a
mirror
swelled
up
softly
under
her
chin
and
you
monsieur
said
she
do
you
dance
frederick
excused
himself
he
did
not
know
how
to
dance
really
but
with
me
are
you
quite
sure
and
poising
herself
on
one
hip
with
her
other
knee
a
little
drawn
back
while
she
stroked
with
her
left
hand
the
pommel
of
her
sword
she
kept
staring
at
him
for
a
minute
with
a
air
at
last
she
said
good
night
then
made
a
pirouette
and
disappeared
frederick
dissatisfied
with
himself
and
not
well
knowing
what
to
do
began
to
wander
through
the
he
entered
the
boudoir
padded
with
pale
blue
silk
with
bouquets
of
flowers
from
the
fields
whilst
on
the
ceiling
in
a
circle
of
gilt
wood
cupids
emerging
out
of
an
azure
sky
played
over
the
clouds
resembling
down
in
appearance
this
display
of
luxuries
which
would
be
only
trifles
to
persons
like
rosanette
dazzled
him
and
he
admired
everything
the
artificial
convolvuli
which
adorned
the
surface
of
the
mirror
the
curtains
on
the
mantelpiece
the
turkish
divan
and
a
sort
of
tent
in
a
recess
in
the
wall
with
pink
silk
hangings
and
a
covering
of
white
muslin
overhead
furniture
made
of
dark
wood
with
inlaid
work
of
copper
filled
the
sleeping
apartment
where
on
a
platform
covered
with
stood
the
large
canopied
bedstead
trimmed
with
pins
with
heads
made
of
precious
stones
stuck
into
pincushions
rings
trailing
over
trays
lockets
with
hoops
of
gold
and
little
silver
chests
could
be
distinguished
in
the
shade
under
the
light
shed
by
a
bohemian
urn
suspended
from
three
chainlets
through
a
little
door
which
was
slightly
ajar
could
be
seen
a
occupying
the
entire
breadth
of
a
terrace
with
an
aviary
at
the
other
end
here
were
surroundings
specially
calculated
to
charm
him
in
a
sudden
revolt
of
his
youthful
blood
he
swore
that
he
would
enjoy
such
things
he
grew
bold
then
coming
back
to
the
place
opening
into
the
where
there
was
now
a
larger
gathering
it
kept
moving
about
in
a
kind
of
luminous
pulverulence
he
stood
to
watch
the
quadrilles
blinking
his
eyes
to
see
better
and
inhaling
the
soft
perfumes
of
the
women
which
floated
through
the
atmosphere
like
an
immense
kiss
but
close
to
him
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
was
pellerin
pellerin
in
full
dress
his
left
arm
over
his
breast
and
with
his
hat
and
a
torn
white
glove
in
his
right
halloa
is
a
long
time
since
we
saw
you
where
the
deuce
have
you
been
gone
to
travel
in
italy
is
a
commonplace
country
enough
italy
eh
not
so
unique
as
people
say
it
is
no
matter
will
you
bring
me
your
sketches
one
of
these
days
and
without
giving
him
time
to
answer
the
artist
began
talking
about
himself
he
had
made
considerable
progress
having
definitely
satisfied
himself
as
to
the
stupidity
of
the
line
we
ought
not
to
look
so
much
for
beauty
and
unity
in
a
work
as
for
character
and
diversity
of
subject
for
everything
exists
in
nature
therefore
everything
is
legitimate
everything
is
plastic
it
is
only
a
question
of
catching
the
note
mind
you
i
have
discovered
the
secret
and
giving
him
a
nudge
he
repeated
several
times
i
have
discovered
the
secret
you
see
just
look
at
that
little
woman
with
the
of
a
sphinx
who
is
dancing
with
a
russian
postilion
that
neat
dry
fixed
all
in
flats
and
in
stiff
tones
indigo
under
the
eyes
a
patch
of
vermilion
on
the
cheek
and
bistre
on
the
temples
pif
paf
and
with
his
thumb
he
drew
as
it
were
in
the
air
whilst
the
big
one
over
there
he
went
on
pointing
towards
a
fishwife
in
a
cherry
gown
with
a
gold
cross
hanging
from
her
neck
and
a
lawn
fichu
fastened
round
her
shoulders
is
nothing
but
curves
the
nostrils
are
spread
out
just
like
the
borders
of
her
cap
the
corners
of
the
mouth
are
rising
up
the
chin
sinks
all
is
fleshy
melting
abundant
tranquil
and
sunshiny
a
true
rubens
nevertheless
they
are
both
perfect
where
then
is
the
type
he
grew
warm
with
the
subject
what
is
this
but
a
beautiful
woman
what
is
it
but
the
beautiful
ah
the
beautiful
tell
me
what
that
is
frederick
interrupted
him
to
enquire
who
was
the
with
the
face
of
a
who
was
in
the
very
act
of
blessing
all
the
dancers
in
the
middle
of
a
pastourelle
oh
he
not
much
a
widower
the
father
of
three
boys
he
leaves
them
without
breeches
spends
his
whole
day
at
the
club
and
lives
with
the
servant
and
who
is
that
dressed
like
a
bailiff
talking
in
the
recess
of
the
window
to
a
marquise
de
pompadour
the
marquise

mademoiselle

an
actress
at
the
gymnase

mistress
of
the
doge

comte
de

they
have
now
been
twenty
years
living
together
nobody
can
tell
why
had
she
fine
eyes
at
one
time
this
woman
as
for
the
citizen
by
her
side
his
name
is
captain
an
old
man
of
the
sort
that
you
can
play
on
with
nothing
in
the
world
except
his
cross
of
the
legion
of
honour
and
his
pension
he
passes
for
the
uncle
of
the
grisettes
at
festival
times
arranges
duels
and
dines
in
the
city
a
rascal
said
frederick
no
an
honest
man
ha
the
artist
was
going
on
to
mention
the
names
of
many
others
when
perceiving
a
gentleman
who
like
molière
physician
wore
a
big
black
serge
gown
opening
very
wide
as
it
descended
in
order
to
display
all
his
trinkets
the
person
who
presents
himself
there
before
you
is
des
rogis
who
full
of
rage
at
not
having
made
a
name
for
himself
has
written
a
book
of
medical
pornography
and
willingly
blacks
people
boots
in
society
while
he
is
at
the
same
time
discreet
these
ladies
adore
him

and
his
wife
that
lean
châtelaine
in
the
grey
dress

about
together
at
every
public

and
at
other
places
too
in
spite
of
domestic
embarrassments
they
have
a
artistic
teas
at
which
verses
are
recited
attention
in
fact
the
doctor
came
up
to
them
at
that
moment
and
soon
they
formed
all
three
at
the
entrance
to
the
a
group
of
talkers
which
was
presently
augmented
by
hussonnet
then
by
the
lover
of
the
female
savage
a
young
poet
who
displayed
under
a
court
cloak
of
francis
i
reign
the
most
pitiful
of
anatomies
and
finally
a
sprightly
youth
disguised
as
a
turk
of
the
barrier
but
his
vest
with
its
yellow
galloon
had
taken
so
many
voyages
on
the
backs
of
strolling
dentists
his
wide
trousers
full
of
creases
were
of
so
faded
a
red
his
turban
rolled
about
like
an
eel
in
the
tartar
fashion
was
so
poor
in
appearance
in
short
his
entire
costume
was
so
wretched
and
that
the
women
did
not
attempt
to
hide
their
disgust
the
doctor
consoled
him
by
pronouncing
eulogies
on
his
mistress
the
lady
in
the
dress
of
a

between

quadrilles
rosanette
advanced
towards
the
mantelpiece
where
an
obese
little
old
man
in
a
maroon
coat
with
gold
buttons
had
seated
himself
in
an
armchair
in
spite
of
his
withered
cheeks
which
fell
over
his
white
cravat
his
hair
still
fair
and
curling
naturally
like
that
of
a
poodle
gave
him
a
certain
frivolity
of
aspect
she
was
listening
to
him
with
her
face
bent
close
to
his
presently
she
accommodated
him
with
a
little
glass
of
syrup
and
nothing
could
be
more
dainty
than
her
hands
under
their
laced
sleeves
which
passed
over
the
facings
of
her
green
coat
when
the
old
man
had
swallowed
it
he
kissed
them
why
that
oudry
a
neighbor
of
arnoux
he
has
lost
her
said
pellerin
smiling
a
longjumeau
postilion
caught
her
by
the
waist
a
waltz
was
beginning
then
all
the
women
seated
round
the
on
benches
rose
up
quickly
at
the
same
time
and
their
petticoats
their
scarfs
and
their
went
whirling
round
they
whirled
so
close
to
him
that
frederick
could
notice
the
beads
of
perspiration
on
their
foreheads
and
this
gyral
movement
more
and
more
lively
regular
provocative
of
dizzy
sensations
communicated
to
his
mind
a
sort
of
intoxication
which
made
other
images
surge
up
within
it
while
every
woman
passed
with
the
same
dazzling
effect
and
each
of
them
with
a
special
kind
of
exciting
influence
according
to
her
style
of
beauty
the
polish
lady
surrendering
herself
in
a
languorous
fashion
inspired
him
with
a
longing
to
clasp
her
to
his
heart
while
they
were
both
spinning
forward
on
a
sledge
along
a
plain
covered
with
snow
horizons
of
tranquil
voluptuousness
in
a
châlet
at
the
side
of
a
lake
opened
out
under
the
footsteps
of
the
swiss
girl
who
waltzed
with
her
bust
erect
and
her
eyelashes
drooping
then
suddenly
the
bacchante
bending
back
her
head
with
its
dark
locks
made
him
dream
of
devouring
caresses
in
a
wood
of
oleanders
in
the
midst
of
a
storm
to
the
confused
accompaniment
of
tabours
the
fishwife
who
was
panting
from
the
rapidity
of
the
music
which
was
far
too
great
for
her
gave
vent
to
bursts
of
laughter
and
he
would
have
liked
while
drinking
with
her
in
some
tavern
in
the
porcherons
to
rumple
her
fichu
with
both
hands
as
in
the
good
old
times
but
the
whose
light
toes
barely
skimmed
the
floor
seemed
to
conceal
under
the
suppleness
of
her
limbs
and
the
seriousness
of
her
face
all
the
refinements
of
modern
love
which
possesses
the
exactitude
of
a
science
and
the
mobility
of
a
bird
rosanette
was
whirling
with
arms
akimbo
her
wig
in
an
awkward
position
bobbing
over
her
collar
flung
around
her
and
at
every
turn
she
was
near
catching
hold
of
frederick
with
the
ends
of
her
gold
spurs
footnote
the
porcherons
was
the
name
given
to
an
old
quarter
of
paris
famous
for
its
taverns
situated
between
the
rue
du
faubourg
montmartre
and
the
rue
de
translator
during
the
closing
bar
of
the
waltz
mademoiselle
vatnaz
made
her
appearance
she
had
an
algerian
handkerchief
on
her
head
a
number
of
piastres
on
her
forehead
antimony
at
the
edges
of
her
eyes
with
a
kind
of
paletot
made
of
black
cashmere
falling
over
a
petticoat
of
sparkling
colour
with
stripes
of
silver
and
in
her
hand
she
held
a
tambourine
behind
her
back
came
a
tall
fellow
in
the
classical
costume
of
dante
who
happened
to
be
she
now
made
no
concealment
any
longer
about
it
the
of
the
alhambra
and
who
though
his
name
was
auguste
delamare
had
first
called
himself
anténor
delamarre
then
delmas
then
belmar
and
at
last
delmar
thus
modifying
and
perfecting
his
name
as
his
celebrity
increased
for
he
had
forsaken
the
concert
for
the
theatre
and
had
even
just
made
his
in
a
noisy
fashion
at
the
ambigu
in
le
hussonnet
on
seeing
him
knitted
his
brows
since
his
play
had
been
rejected
he
hated
actors
it
was
impossible
to
conceive
the
vanity
of
individuals
of
this
sort
and
above
all
of
this
fellow
what
a
prig
just
look
at
him
after
a
light
bow
towards
rosanette
delmar
leaned
back
against
the
mantelpiece
and
he
remained
motionless
with
one
hand
over
his
heart
his
left
foot
thrust
forward
his
eyes
raised
towards
heaven
with
his
wreath
of
gilt
laurels
above
his
cowl
while
he
strove
to
put
into
the
expression
of
his
face
a
considerable
amount
of
poetry
in
order
to
fascinate
the
ladies
they
made
at
some
distance
a
great
circle
around
him
but
the
vatnaz
having
given
rosanette
a
prolonged
embrace
came
to
beg
of
hussonnet
to
revise
with
a
view
to
the
improvement
of
the
style
an
educational
work
which
she
intended
to
publish
under
the
title
of
the
young
ladies
garland
a
collection
of
literature
and
moral
philosophy
the
man
of
letters
promised
to
assist
her
in
the
preparation
of
the
work
then
she
asked
him
whether
he
could
not
in
one
of
the
prints
to
which
he
had
access
give
her
friend
a
slight
puff
and
even
assign
to
him
later
some
part
hussonnet
had
forgotten
to
take
a
glass
of
punch
on
account
of
her
it
was
arnoux
who
had
brewed
the
beverage
and
followed
by
the
groom
carrying
an
empty
tray
he
offered
it
to
the
ladies
with
a
air
when
he
came
to
pass
in
front
of
oudry
rosanette
stopped
him
well
and
this
little
business
he
coloured
slightly
finally
addressing
the
old
man
our
fair
friend
tells
me
that
you
would
have
the
kindness
what
of
that
neighbour
i
am
quite
at
your
service
and
dambreuse
name
was
pronounced
as
they
were
talking
to
one
another
in
low
tones
frederick
could
only
hear
indistinctly
and
he
made
his
way
to
the
other
side
of
the
mantelpiece
where
rosanette
and
delmar
were
chatting
together
the
mummer
had
a
vulgar
countenance
made
like
the
scenery
of
the
stage
to
be
viewed
from
a
distance
coarse
hands
big
feet
and
a
heavy
jaw
and
he
disparaged
the
most
distinguished
actors
spoke
of
poets
with
patronising
contempt
made
use
of
the
expressions
my
organ
my
physique
my
powers
enamelling
his
conversation
with
words
that
were
scarcely
intelligible
even
to
himself
and
for
which
he
had
quite
an
affection
such
as
analogue
and
homogeneity
rosanette
listened
to
him
with
little
nods
of
approbation
one
could
see
her
enthusiasm
bursting
out
under
the
paint
on
her
cheeks
and
a
touch
of
moisture
passed
like
a
veil
over
her
bright
eyes
of
an
indefinable
colour
how
could
such
a
man
as
this
fascinate
her
frederick
internally
excited
himself
to
greater
contempt
for
him
in
order
to
banish
perhaps
the
species
of
envy
which
he
felt
with
regard
to
him
mademoiselle
vatnaz
was
now
with
arnoux
and
while
laughing
from
time
to
time
very
loudly
she
cast
glances
towards
rosanette
of
whom
oudry
did
not
lose
sight
then
arnoux
and
the
vatnaz
disappeared
the
old
man
began
talking
in
a
subdued
voice
to
rosanette
well
yes
is
settled
then
leave
me
alone
and
she
asked
frederick
to
go
and
give
a
look
into
the
kitchen
to
see
whether
arnoux
happened
to
be
there
a
battalion
of
glasses
covered
the
floor
and
the
saucepans
the
pots
the
and
the
were
all
in
a
state
of
commotion
arnoux
was
giving
directions
to
the
servants
whom
he
thee
and
thou
beating
up
the
mustard
tasting
the
sauces
and
larking
with
the
housemaid
all
right
he
said
tell
them
is
ready
i
going
to
have
it
served
up
the
dancing
had
ceased
the
women
came
and
sat
down
the
men
were
walking
about
in
the
centre
of
the
one
of
the
curtains
stretched
over
a
window
was
swelling
in
the
wind
and
the
sphinx
in
spite
of
the
observations
of
everyone
exposed
her
sweating
arms
to
the
current
of
air
where
could
rosanette
be
frederick
went
on
further
to
find
her
even
into
her
boudoir
and
her
bedroom
some
in
order
to
be
alone
or
to
be
in
pairs
had
retreated
into
the
corners
whisperings
intermingled
with
the
shade
there
were
little
laughs
stifled
under
handkerchiefs
and
at
the
sides
of
women
corsages
one
could
catch
glimpses
of
fans
quivering
with
slow
gentle
movements
like
the
beating
of
a
wounded
bird
wings
as
he
entered
the
he
saw
under
the
large
leaves
of
a
caladium
near
the
jet
delmar
lying
on
his
face
on
the
sofa
covered
with
linen
cloth
rosanette
seated
beside
him
had
passed
her
fingers
through
his
hair
and
they
were
gazing
into
each
other
faces
at
the
same
moment
arnoux
came
in
at
the
opposite
side
that
which
was
near
the
aviary
delmar
sprang
to
his
feet
then
he
went
out
at
a
rapid
pace
without
turning
round
and
even
paused
close
to
the
door
to
gather
a
hibiscus
flower
with
which
he
adorned
his
rosanette
hung
down
her
head
frederick
who
caught
a
sight
of
her
profile
saw
that
she
was
in
tears
i
say
what
the
matter
with
you
exclaimed
arnoux
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
without
replying
is
it
on
account
of
him
he
went
on
she
threw
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
kissing
him
on
the
forehead
slowly
you
know
well
that
i
will
always
love
you
my
big
fellow
think
no
more
about
it
let
us
go
to
supper
a
copper
chandelier
with
forty
wax
tapers
lighted
up
the
the
walls
of
which
were
hidden
from
view
under
some
fine
old
earthenware
that
was
hung
up
there
and
this
crude
light
falling
perpendicularly
rendered
still
whiter
amid
the
and
the
fruits
a
huge
turbot
which
occupied
the
centre
of
the
tablecloth
with
plates
all
round
filled
with
crayfish
soup
with
a
rustle
of
garments
the
women
having
arranged
their
skirts
their
sleeves
and
their
scarfs
took
their
seats
beside
one
another
the
men
standing
up
posted
themselves
at
the
corners
pellerin
and
oudry
were
placed
near
rosanette
arnoux
was
facing
her
palazot
and
his
female
companion
had
just
gone
out
to
them
said
she
now
let
us
begin
the
attack
and
the
a
facetious
man
with
a
big
sign
of
the
cross
said
grace
the
ladies
were
scandalised
and
especially
the
fishwife
the
mother
of
a
young
girl
of
whom
she
wished
to
make
an
honest
woman
neither
did
arnoux
like
that
sort
of
thing
as
he
considered
that
religion
ought
to
be
respected
a
german
clock
with
a
cock
attached
to
it
happening
to
chime
out
the
hour
of
two
gave
rise
to
a
number
of
jokes
about
the
cuckoo
all
kinds
of
talk
followed
puns
anecdotes
bragging
remarks
bets
lies
taken
for
truth
improbable
assertions
a
tumult
of
words
which
soon
became
dispersed
in
the
form
of
chats
between
particular
individuals
the
wines
went
round
the
dishes
succeeded
each
other
the
doctor
carved
an
orange
or
a
cork
would
every
now
and
then
be
flung
from
a
distance
people
would
quit
their
seats
to
go
and
talk
to
some
one
at
another
end
of
the
table
rosanette
turned
round
towards
delmar
who
sat
motionless
behind
her
pellerin
kept
babbling
oudry
smiled
mademoiselle
vatnaz
ate
almost
alone
a
group
of
crayfish
and
the
shells
crackled
under
her
long
teeth
the
angel
poised
on
the
the
only
place
on
which
her
wings
permitted
her
to
sit
down
was
placidly
masticating
without
ever
stopping
what
an
appetite
the
kept
repeating
in
amazement
what
an
appetite
and
the
sphinx
drank
brandy
screamed
out
with
her
throat
full
and
wriggled
like
a
demon
suddenly
her
jaws
swelled
and
no
longer
being
able
to
keep
down
the
blood
which
rushed
to
her
head
and
nearly
choked
her
she
pressed
her
napkin
against
her
lips
and
threw
herself
under
the
table
frederick
had
seen
her
falling
is
nothing
and
at
his
entreaties
to
be
allowed
to
go
and
look
after
her
she
replied
slowly
pooh
what
the
good
that
just
as
pleasant
as
anything
else
life
is
not
so
amusing
then
he
shivered
a
feeling
of
icy
sadness
taking
possession
of
him
as
if
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
whole
worlds
of
wretchedness
and
despair
a
of
charcoal
beside
a
the
corpses
of
the
morgue
in
leathern
aprons
with
the
tap
of
cold
water
that
flows
over
their
heads
meanwhile
hussonnet
squatted
at
the
feet
of
the
female
savage
was
howling
in
a
hoarse
voice
in
imitation
of
the
actor
grassot
be
not
cruel
o
celuta
this
little
family
fête
is
charming
intoxicate
me
with
delight
my
loves
let
us
be
gay
let
us
be
gay
and
he
began
kissing
the
women
on
the
shoulders
they
quivered
under
the
tickling
of
his
moustaches
then
he
conceived
the
idea
of
breaking
a
plate
against
his
head
by
rapping
it
there
with
a
little
energy
others
followed
his
example
the
broken
earthenware
flew
about
in
bits
like
slates
in
a
storm
and
the
exclaimed
do
bother
yourselves
about
it
these
cost
nothing
we
get
a
present
of
them
from
the
merchant
who
makes
them
every
eye
was
riveted
on
arnoux
he
replied
ha
about
the
invoice
allow
me
desiring
no
doubt
to
pass
for
not
being
or
for
no
longer
being
rosanette
lover
but
two
angry
voices
here
made
themselves
heard
idiot
rascal
i
am
at
your
command
so
am
i
at
yours
it
was
the
mediæval
knight
and
the
russian
postilion
who
were
disputing
the
latter
having
maintained
that
armour
dispensed
with
bravery
while
the
other
regarded
this
view
as
an
insult
he
desired
to
fight
all
interposed
to
prevent
him
and
in
the
midst
of
the
uproar
the
captain
tried
to
make
himself
heard
listen
to
me
messieurs
one
word
i
have
some
experience
messieurs
rosanette
by
tapping
with
her
knife
on
a
glass
succeeded
eventually
in
restoring
silence
and
addressing
the
knight
who
had
kept
his
helmet
on
and
then
the
postilion
whose
head
was
covered
with
a
hairy
cap
take
off
that
saucepan
of
yours
and
you
there
your
wolf
head
are
you
going
to
obey
me
damn
you
pray
show
respect
to
my
epaulets
i
am
your
commanding
officer
they
complied
and
everyone
present
applauded
exclaiming
long
live
the
maréchale
long
live
the
maréchale
then
she
took
a
bottle
of
champagne
off
the
stove
and
poured
out
its
contents
into
the
cups
which
they
successively
stretched
forth
to
her
as
the
table
was
very
large
the
guests
especially
the
women
came
over
to
her
side
and
stood
erect
on
tiptoe
on
the
slats
of
the
chairs
so
as
to
form
for
the
space
of
a
minute
a
pyramidal
group
of
naked
shoulders
extended
arms
and
stooping
bodies
and
over
all
these
objects
a
spray
of
wine
played
for
some
time
for
the
and
arnoux
at
opposite
corners
of
the
each
letting
fly
the
cork
of
a
bottle
splashed
the
faces
of
those
around
them
the
little
birds
of
the
aviary
the
door
of
which
had
been
left
open
broke
into
the
apartment
quite
scared
flying
round
the
chandelier
knocking
against
the
and
against
the
furniture
and
some
of
them
alighting
on
the
heads
of
the
guests
presented
the
appearance
there
of
large
flowers
the
musicians
had
gone
the
piano
had
been
drawn
out
of
the
anteroom
the
vatnaz
seated
herself
before
it
and
accompanied
by
the
who
thumped
his
tambourine
she
made
a
wild
dash
into
a
quadrille
striking
the
keys
like
a
horse
pawing
the
ground
and
wriggling
her
waist
about
the
better
to
mark
the
time
the
maréchale
dragged
out
frederick
hussonnet
took
the
windmill
the
put
out
her
joints
like
a
the
exhibited
the
manoeuvres
of
an
the
female
savage
with
outspread
arms
imitated
the
swaying
motion
of
a
boat
at
last
unable
to
go
on
any
further
they
all
stopped
and
a
window
was
flung
open
the
broad
daylight
penetrated
the
apartment
with
the
cool
breath
of
morning
there
was
an
exclamation
of
astonishment
and
then
came
silence
the
yellow
flames
flickered
making
the
sockets
of
the
candlesticks
crack
from
time
to
time
the
floor
was
strewn
with
ribbons
flowers
and
pearls
the
were
sticky
with
the
stains
of
punch
and
syrup
the
hangings
were
soiled
the
dresses
rumpled
and
dusty
the
plaits
of
the
women
hair
hung
loose
over
their
shoulders
and
the
paint
trickling
down
with
the
perspiration
revealed
pallid
faces
and
red
blinking
eyelids
the
maréchale
fresh
as
if
she
had
come
out
of
a
bath
had
rosy
checks
and
sparkling
eyes
she
flung
her
wig
some
distance
away
and
her
hair
fell
around
her
like
a
fleece
allowing
none
of
her
uniform
to
be
seen
except
her
breeches
the
effect
thus
produced
being
at
the
same
time
comical
and
pretty
the
sphinx
whose
teeth
chattered
as
if
she
had
the
ague
wanted
a
shawl
rosanette
rushed
up
to
her
own
room
to
look
for
one
and
as
the
other
came
after
her
she
quickly
shut
the
door
in
her
face
the
turk
remarked
in
a
loud
tone
that
oudry
had
not
been
seen
going
out
nobody
noticed
the
maliciousness
of
this
observation
so
worn
out
were
they
all
then
while
waiting
for
vehicles
they
managed
to
get
on
their
hats
and
cloaks
it
struck
seven
the
angel
was
still
in
the
seated
at
the
table
with
a
plate
of
sardines
and
fruit
stewed
in
melted
butter
in
front
of
her
and
close
beside
her
was
the
fishwife
smoking
cigarettes
while
giving
her
advice
as
to
the
right
way
to
live
at
last
the
cabs
having
arrived
the
guests
took
their
departure
hussonnet
who
had
an
engagement
as
correspondent
for
the
provinces
had
to
read
through
newspapers
before
his
breakfast
the
female
savage
had
a
rehearsal
at
the
theatre
pellerin
had
to
see
a
model
and
the
had
three
appointments
but
the
angel
attacked
by
the
preliminary
symptoms
of
indigestion
was
unable
to
rise
the
mediæval
baron
carried
her
to
the
cab
take
care
of
her
wings
cried
the
through
the
window
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
mademoiselle
vatnaz
said
to
rosanette
darling
that
was
a
very
nice
evening
party
of
yours
then
bending
close
to
her
ear
take
care
of
him
till
better
times
come
returned
the
maréchale
in
drawling
tones
as
she
turned
her
back
arnoux
and
frederick
returned
together
just
as
they
had
come
the
dealer
in
faïence
looked
so
gloomy
that
his
companion
wished
to
know
if
he
were
i
not
at
all
he
bit
his
moustache
knitted
his
brows
and
frederick
asked
him
was
it
his
business
that
annoyed
him
by
no
means
then
all
of
a
sudden
you
know
him
père
oudry
do
you
and
with
a
spiteful
expression
on
his
countenance
he
rich
the
old
scoundrel
after
this
arnoux
spoke
about
an
important
piece
of
which
had
to
be
finished
that
day
at
his
works
he
wanted
to
see
it
the
train
was
starting
in
an
hour
meantime
i
must
go
and
embrace
my
wife
ha
his
wife
thought
frederick
then
he
made
his
way
home
to
go
to
bed
with
his
head
aching
terribly
and
to
appease
his
thirst
he
swallowed
a
whole
carafe
of
water
another
thirst
had
come
to
him
the
thirst
for
women
for
licentious
pleasure
and
all
that
parisian
life
permitted
him
to
enjoy
he
felt
somewhat
stunned
like
a
man
coming
out
of
a
ship
and
in
the
visions
that
haunted
his
first
sleep
he
saw
the
shoulders
of
the
fishwife
the
loins
of
the
the
calves
of
the
polish
lady
and
the
of
the
female
savage
flying
past
him
and
coming
back
again
continually
then
two
large
black
eyes
which
had
not
been
at
the
ball
appeared
before
him
and
light
as
butterflies
burning
as
torches
they
came
and
went
ascended
to
the
cornice
and
descended
to
his
very
mouth
frederick
made
desperate
efforts
to
recognise
those
eyes
without
succeeding
in
doing
so
but
already
the
dream
had
taken
hold
of
him
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
yoked
beside
arnoux
to
the
pole
of
a
and
that
the
maréchale
astride
of
him
was
disembowelling
him
with
her
gold
spurs
chapter
viii
frederick
entertains
frederick
found
a
little
mansion
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
rumfort
and
he
bought
it
along
with
the
brougham
the
horse
the
furniture
and
two
which
were
taken
from
the
arnoux
house
to
be
placed
on
each
side
of
his
door
in
the
rear
of
this
apartment
were
a
bedroom
and
a
closet
the
idea
occurred
to
his
mind
to
put
up
deslauriers
there
but
how
could
he
receive
her
his
future
mistress
the
presence
of
a
friend
would
be
an
obstacle
he
knocked
down
the
in
order
to
enlarge
the
and
converted
the
closet
into
a
he
bought
the
works
of
the
poets
whom
he
loved
books
of
travel
atlases
and
dictionaries
for
he
had
innumerable
plans
of
study
he
hurried
on
the
workmen
rushed
about
to
the
different
shops
and
in
his
impatience
to
enjoy
carried
off
everything
without
even
holding
out
for
a
bargain
beforehand
from
the
tradesmen
bills
frederick
ascertained
that
he
would
have
to
expend
very
soon
forty
thousand
francs
not
including
the
succession
duties
which
would
exceed
thousand
as
his
fortune
was
in
landed
property
he
wrote
to
the
notary
at
havre
to
sell
a
portion
of
it
in
order
to
pay
off
his
debts
and
to
have
some
money
at
his
disposal
then
anxious
to
become
acquainted
at
last
with
that
vague
entity
glittering
and
indefinable
which
is
known
as
society
he
sent
a
note
to
the
dambreuses
to
know
whether
he
might
be
at
liberty
to
call
upon
them
madame
in
reply
said
she
would
expect
a
visit
from
him
the
following
day
this
happened
to
be
their
carriages
were
standing
in
the
courtyard
two
footmen
rushed
forward
under
the
marquée
and
a
third
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
began
walking
in
front
of
him
he
was
conducted
through
an
anteroom
a
second
room
and
then
a
with
high
windows
and
a
monumental
supporting
a
in
the
form
of
a
sphere
and
two
enormous
porcelain
vases
in
each
of
which
bristled
like
a
golden
bush
a
cluster
of
sconces
pictures
in
the
manner
of
espagnolet
hung
on
the
walls
the
heavy
tapestry
portières
fell
majestically
and
the
armchairs
the
brackets
the
tables
the
entire
furniture
which
was
in
the
style
of
the
second
empire
had
a
certain
imposing
and
diplomatic
air
frederick
smiled
with
pleasure
in
spite
of
himself
at
last
he
reached
an
oval
apartment
wainscoted
in
stuffed
with
dainty
furniture
and
letting
in
the
light
through
a
single
sheet
of
which
looked
out
on
a
garden
madame
dambreuse
was
seated
at
the
fireside
with
a
dozen
persons
gathered
round
her
in
a
circle
with
a
polite
greeting
she
made
a
sign
to
him
to
take
a
seat
without
however
exhibiting
any
surprise
at
not
having
seen
him
for
so
long
a
time
just
at
the
moment
when
he
was
entering
the
room
they
had
been
praising
the
eloquence
of
the
abbé
coeur
then
they
deplored
the
immorality
of
servants
a
topic
suggested
by
a
theft
which
a
had
committed
and
they
began
to
indulge
in
old
madame
de
sommery
had
a
cold
mademoiselle
de
turvisot
had
got
married
the
montcharrons
would
not
return
before
the
end
of
january
neither
would
the
bretancourts
now
that
people
remained
in
the
country
till
a
late
period
of
the
year
and
the
triviality
of
the
conversation
was
so
to
speak
intensified
by
the
luxuriousness
of
the
surroundings
but
what
they
said
was
less
stupid
than
their
way
of
talking
which
was
aimless
disconnected
and
utterly
devoid
of
animation
and
yet
there
were
present
men
versed
in
life
an
the
curé
of
a
large
parish
two
or
three
government
officials
of
high
rank
they
adhered
to
the
most
hackneyed
commonplaces
some
of
them
resembled
weary
dowagers
others
had
the
appearance
of
and
old
men
accompanied
their
wives
of
whom
they
were
old
enough
to
be
the
grandfathers
madame
dambreuse
received
all
of
them
graciously
when
it
was
mentioned
that
anyone
was
ill
she
knitted
her
brows
with
a
painful
expression
on
her
face
and
when
balls
or
evening
parties
were
discussed
assumed
a
joyous
air
she
would
ere
long
be
compelled
to
deprive
herself
of
these
pleasures
for
she
was
going
to
take
away
from
a
a
niece
of
her
husband
an
orphan
the
guests
extolled
her
devotedness
this
was
behaving
like
a
true
mother
of
a
family
frederick
gazed
at
her
attentively
the
dull
skin
of
her
face
looked
as
if
it
had
been
stretched
out
and
had
a
bloom
in
which
there
was
no
brilliancy
like
that
of
preserved
fruit
but
her
hair
which
was
in
corkscrew
curls
after
the
english
fashion
was
finer
than
silk
her
eyes
of
a
sparkling
blue
and
all
her
movements
were
dainty
seated
at
the
lower
end
of
the
apartment
on
a
small
sofa
she
kept
brushing
off
the
red
flock
from
a
japanese
screen
no
doubt
in
order
to
let
her
hands
be
seen
to
greater
advantage
long
narrow
hands
a
little
thin
with
fingers
tilting
up
at
the
points
she
wore
a
grey
moiré
gown
with
a
body
like
a
puritan
lady
frederick
asked
her
whether
she
intended
to
go
to
la
fortelle
this
year
madame
dambreuse
was
unable
to
say
he
was
sure
however
of
one
thing
that
one
would
be
bored
to
death
in
nogent
then
the
visitors
thronged
in
more
quickly
there
was
an
incessant
rustling
of
robes
on
the
carpet
ladies
seated
on
the
edges
of
chairs
gave
vent
to
little
sneering
laughs
articulated
two
or
three
words
and
at
the
end
of
five
minutes
left
along
with
their
young
daughters
it
soon
became
impossible
to
follow
the
conversation
and
frederick
withdrew
when
madame
dambreuse
said
to
him
every
wednesday
is
it
not
monsieur
moreau
making
up
for
her
previous
display
of
indifference
by
these
simple
words
he
was
satisfied
nevertheless
he
took
a
deep
breath
when
he
got
out
into
the
open
air
and
needing
a
less
artificial
environment
frederick
recalled
to
mind
that
he
owed
the
maréchale
a
visit
the
door
of
the
anteroom
was
open
two
havanese
lapdogs
rushed
forward
a
voice
exclaimed
delphine
delphine
is
that
you
felix
he
stood
there
without
advancing
a
step
the
two
little
dogs
kept
yelping
continually
at
length
rosanette
appeared
wrapped
up
in
a
sort
of
of
white
muslin
trimmed
with
lace
and
with
her
stockingless
feet
in
turkish
slippers
ah
excuse
me
monsieur
i
thought
it
was
the
hairdresser
one
minute
i
am
coming
back
and
he
was
left
alone
in
the
the
venetian
blinds
were
closed
frederick
as
he
cast
a
glance
round
was
beginning
to
recall
the
hubbub
of
the
other
night
when
he
noticed
on
the
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
a
man
hat
an
old
felt
hat
bruised
greasy
dirty
to
whom
did
this
hat
belong
impudently
displaying
its
torn
lining
it
seemed
to
say
i
have
the
laugh
after
all
i
am
the
master
the
maréchale
suddenly
reappeared
on
the
scene
she
took
up
the
hat
opened
the
conservatory
flung
it
in
there
shut
the
door
again
other
doors
flew
open
and
closed
again
at
the
same
moment
and
having
brought
frederick
through
the
kitchen
she
introduced
him
into
her
it
could
at
once
be
seen
that
this
was
the
most
frequented
room
in
the
house
and
so
to
speak
its
true
moral
centre
the
walls
the
armchairs
and
a
big
divan
with
a
spring
were
adorned
with
a
chintz
pattern
on
which
was
traced
a
great
deal
of
foliage
on
a
white
marble
table
stood
two
large
of
fine
blue
earthenware
crystal
shelves
forming
a
whatnot
overhead
were
laden
with
phials
brushes
combs
sticks
of
cosmetic
and
the
fire
was
reflected
in
a
high
a
sheet
was
hanging
outside
a
bath
and
odours
of
and
of
benzoin
were
exhaled
you
excuse
the
disorder
i
dining
in
the
city
this
evening
and
as
she
turned
on
her
heel
she
was
near
crushing
one
of
the
little
dogs
frederick
declared
that
they
were
charming
she
lifted
up
the
pair
of
them
and
raising
their
black
snouts
up
to
her
face
come
do
a
laugh
kiss
the
gentleman
a
man
dressed
in
a
dirty
overcoat
with
a
fur
collar
here
entered
abruptly
felix
my
worthy
fellow
said
she
you
have
that
business
of
yours
disposed
of
next
sunday
without
fail
the
man
proceeded
to
dress
her
hair
frederick
told
her
he
had
heard
news
of
her
friends
madame
de
rochegune
madame
de
and
madame
lombard
every
woman
being
noble
as
if
it
were
at
the
mansion
of
the
dambreuses
then
he
talked
about
the
theatres
an
extraordinary
performance
was
to
be
given
that
evening
at
the
ambigu
shall
you
go
faith
no
i
staying
at
home
delphine
appeared
her
mistress
gave
her
a
scolding
for
having
gone
out
without
permission
the
other
vowed
that
she
was
just
returning
from
market
well
bring
me
your
book
you
have
no
objection
is
that
so
and
reading
the
in
a
low
tone
rosanette
made
remarks
on
every
item
the
different
sums
were
not
added
up
correctly
hand
me
over
four
sous
delphine
handed
the
amount
over
to
her
and
when
she
had
sent
the
maid
away
ah
holy
virgin
could
i
be
more
unfortunate
than
i
am
with
these
creatures
frederick
was
shocked
at
this
complaint
about
servants
it
recalled
the
others
too
vividly
to
his
mind
and
established
between
the
two
houses
a
kind
of
vexatious
equality
when
delphine
came
back
again
she
drew
close
to
the
maréchale
side
in
order
to
whisper
something
in
her
ear
ah
no
i
do
want
her
delphine
presented
herself
once
more
madame
she
insists
ah
what
a
plague
throw
her
out
at
the
same
moment
an
old
lady
dressed
in
black
pushed
forward
the
door
frederick
heard
nothing
saw
nothing
rosanette
rushed
into
her
apartment
to
meet
her
when
she
reappeared
her
cheeks
were
flushed
and
she
sat
down
in
one
of
the
armchairs
without
saying
a
word
a
tear
fell
down
her
face
then
turning
towards
the
young
man
softly
what
is
your
christian
name
frederick
ha
federico
it
does
annoy
you
when
i
address
you
in
that
way
and
she
gazed
at
him
in
a
coaxing
sort
of
way
that
was
almost
amorous
all
of
a
sudden
she
uttered
an
exclamation
of
delight
at
the
sight
of
mademoiselle
vatnaz
the
had
no
time
to
lose
before
presiding
at
her
at
six
sharp
and
she
was
panting
for
breath
being
completely
exhausted
she
first
took
out
of
her
pocket
a
gold
chain
in
a
paper
then
various
objects
that
she
had
bought
you
should
know
that
there
are
in
the
rue

rosanette
went
to
a
drawer
to
get
ten
napoleons
neither
of
the
pair
had
any
money
frederick
offered
some
i
pay

back
said
the
vatnaz
as
she
stuffed
the
fifteen
francs
into
her
handbag
but
you
are
a
naughty
boy
i
do
love
you
any
longer
you
did
get
me
to
dance
with

even
once
the
other
evening
ah

came
across
a
case
of
stuffed
which
are
perfect
loves
at
a
shop
in
the
quai

were
in
your
place
i
would
make
myself
a
present
of
them

here

think
of

and
she
exhibited
an
old
remnant
of
pink
silk
which
she
had
purchased
at
the
temple
to
make
a
mediæval
doublet
for
delmar
he
came
did
he
no
that
singular
and
after
a
minute
silence
where
are
you
going
this
evening
to
alphonsine
said
rosanette
this
being
the
third
version
given
by
her
as
to
the
way
in
which
she
was
going
to
pass
the
evening
mademoiselle
vatnaz
went
on
and
what
news
about
the
old
man
of
the
mountain
but
with
an
abrupt
wink
the
maréchale
bade
her
hold
her
tongue
and
she
accompanied
frederick
out
as
far
as
the
anteroom
to
ascertain
from
him
whether
he
would
soon
see
arnoux
pray
ask
him
to
come
not
before
his
wife
mind
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
an
umbrella
was
placed
against
the
wall
near
a
pair
of
goloshes
vatnaz
goloshes
said
rosanette
what
a
foot
eh
my
little
friend
is
rather
strongly
built
and
in
a
melodramatic
tone
making
the
final
letter
of
the
word
roll
do
her
frederick
emboldened
by
a
confidence
of
this
sort
tried
to
kiss
her
on
the
neck
oh
do
it
it
costs
nothing
he
felt
rather
as
he
left
her
having
no
doubt
that
ere
long
the
maréchale
would
be
his
mistress
this
desire
awakened
another
in
him
and
in
spite
of
the
species
of
grudge
that
he
owed
her
he
felt
a
longing
to
see
madame
arnoux
besides
he
would
have
to
call
at
her
house
in
order
to
execute
the
commission
with
which
he
had
been
entrusted
by
rosanette
but
now
thought
he
it
had
just
struck
six
arnoux
is
probably
at
home
so
he
put
off
his
visit
till
the
following
day
she
was
seated
in
the
same
attitude
as
on
the
former
day
and
was
sewing
a
little
boy
shirt
the
child
at
her
feet
was
playing
with
a
wooden
toy
menagerie
marthe
a
short
distance
away
was
writing
he
began
by
complimenting
her
on
her
children
she
replied
without
any
exaggeration
of
maternal
silliness
the
room
had
a
tranquil
aspect
a
glow
of
sunshine
stole
in
through
the
lighting
up
the
angles
of
the
different
articles
of
furniture
and
as
madame
arnoux
sat
close
beside
the
window
a
large
ray
falling
on
the
curls
over
the
nape
of
her
neck
penetrated
with
liquid
gold
her
skin
which
assumed
the
colour
of
amber
then
he
said
this
young
lady
here
has
grown
very
tall
during
the
past
three
years
do
you
remember
mademoiselle
when
you
slept
on
my
knees
in
the
carriage
marthe
did
not
remember
one
evening
returning
from
there
was
a
look
of
peculiar
sadness
in
madame
arnoux
face
was
it
in
order
to
prevent
any
allusion
on
his
part
to
the
memories
they
possessed
in
common
her
beautiful
black
eyes
whose
sclerotics
were
glistening
moved
gently
under
their
somewhat
drooping
lids
and
her
pupils
revealed
in
their
depths
an
inexpressible
kindness
of
heart
he
was
seized
with
a
love
stronger
than
ever
a
passion
that
knew
no
bounds
it
enervated
him
to
contemplate
the
object
of
his
attachment
however
he
shook
off
this
feeling
how
was
he
to
make
the
most
of
himself
by
what
means
and
having
turned
the
matter
over
thoroughly
in
his
mind
frederick
could
think
of
none
that
seemed
more
effectual
than
money
he
began
talking
about
the
weather
which
was
less
cold
than
it
had
been
at
havre
you
have
been
there
yes
about
a
family
matter
an
inheritance
ah
i
am
very
glad
she
said
with
an
air
of
such
genuine
pleasure
that
he
felt
quite
touched
just
as
if
she
had
rendered
him
a
great
service
she
asked
him
what
he
intended
to
do
as
it
was
necessary
for
a
man
to
occupy
himself
with
something
he
recalled
to
mind
his
false
position
and
said
that
he
hoped
to
reach
the
council
of
state
with
the
help
of
dambreuse
the
secretary
you
are
acquainted
with
him
perhaps
merely
by
name
then
in
a
low
tone
brought
you
to
the
ball
the
other
night
did
he
not
frederick
remained
silent
that
was
what
i
wanted
to
know
thanks
after
that
she
put
two
or
three
discreet
questions
to
him
about
his
family
and
the
part
of
the
country
in
which
he
lived
it
was
very
kind
of
him
not
to
have
forgotten
them
after
having
lived
so
long
away
from
paris
but
could
i
do
so
he
rejoined
have
you
any
doubt
about
it
madame
arnoux
arose
i
believe
that
you
entertain
towards
us
a
true
and
solid
affection
revoir
and
she
extended
her
hand
towards
him
in
a
sincere
and
virile
fashion
was
this
not
an
engagement
a
promise
frederick
felt
a
sense
of
delight
at
merely
living
he
had
to
restrain
himself
to
keep
from
singing
he
wanted
to
burst
out
to
do
generous
deeds
and
to
give
alms
he
looked
around
him
to
see
if
there
were
anyone
near
whom
he
could
relieve
no
wretch
happened
to
be
passing
by
and
his
desire
for
evaporated
for
he
was
not
a
man
to
go
out
of
his
way
to
find
opportunities
for
benevolence
then
he
remembered
his
friends
the
first
of
whom
he
thought
was
hussonnet
the
second
pellerin
the
lowly
position
of
dussardier
naturally
called
for
consideration
as
for
cisy
he
was
glad
to
let
that
young
aristocrat
get
a
slight
glimpse
as
to
the
extent
of
his
fortune
he
wrote
accordingly
to
all
four
to
come
to
a
housewarming
the
following
sunday
at
eleven
sharp
and
he
told
deslauriers
to
bring
sénécal
the
tutor
had
been
dismissed
from
the
third
in
which
he
had
been
employed
for
not
having
given
his
consent
to
the
distribution
of
prizes
a
custom
which
he
looked
upon
as
dangerous
to
equality
he
was
now
with
an
and
for
the
past
six
months
had
been
no
longer
living
with
deslauriers
there
had
been
nothing
painful
about
their
parting
sénécal
had
been
visited
by
men
in
blouses
all
patriots
all
workmen
all
honest
fellows
but
at
the
same
time
men
whose
society
seemed
distasteful
to
the
advocate
besides
he
disliked
certain
ideas
of
his
friend
excellent
though
they
might
be
as
weapons
of
warfare
he
held
his
tongue
on
the
subject
through
motives
of
ambition
deeming
it
prudent
to
pay
deference
to
him
in
order
to
exercise
control
over
him
for
he
looked
forward
impatiently
to
a
revolutionary
movement
in
which
he
calculated
on
making
an
opening
for
himself
and
occupying
a
prominent
position
sénécal
convictions
were
more
disinterested
every
evening
when
his
work
was
finished
he
returned
to
his
garret
and
sought
in
books
for
something
that
might
justify
his
dreams
he
had
annotated
the
he
had
crammed
himself
with
the
he
was
acquainted
with
mably
morelly
fourier
comte
cabet
louis
blanc
the
heavy
cartload
of
socialistic
writers
those
who
claim
for
humanity
the
dead
level
of
barracks
those
who
would
like
to
amuse
it
in
a
brothel
or
to
bend
it
over
a
counter
and
from
a
medley
of
all
these
things
he
constructed
an
ideal
of
virtuous
democracy
with
the
double
aspect
of
a
farm
in
which
the
landlord
was
to
receive
a
share
of
the
produce
and
a
a
sort
of
american
lacedæmon
in
which
the
individual
would
only
exist
for
the
benefit
of
society
which
was
to
be
more
omnipotent
absolute
infallible
and
divine
than
the
grand
lamas
and
the
nebuchadnezzars
he
had
no
doubt
as
to
the
approaching
realisation
of
this
ideal
and
sénécal
raged
against
everything
that
he
considered
hostile
to
it
with
the
reasoning
of
a
geometrician
and
the
zeal
of
an
inquisitor
titles
of
nobility
crosses
plumes
liveries
above
all
and
even
reputations
that
were
too
scandalised
him
his
studies
as
well
as
his
sufferings
intensifying
every
day
his
essential
hatred
of
every
kind
of
distinction
and
every
form
of
social
superiority
what
do
i
owe
to
this
gentleman
that
i
should
be
polite
to
him
if
he
wants
me
he
can
come
to
me
deslauriers
however
forced
him
to
go
to
frederick
reunion
they
found
their
friend
in
his
bedroom
blinds
and
double
curtains
venetian
mirrors
nothing
was
wanting
there
frederick
in
a
velvet
vest
was
lying
back
on
an
smoking
cigarettes
of
turkish
tobacco
sénécal
wore
the
gloomy
look
of
a
bigot
arriving
in
the
midst
of
a
deslauriers
gave
him
a
single
comprehensive
glance
then
with
a
very
low
bow
monseigneur
allow
me
to
pay
my
respects
to
you
dussardier
leaped
on
his
neck
so
you
are
a
rich
man
now
ah
upon
my
soul
so
much
the
better
cisy
made
his
appearance
with
crape
on
his
hat
since
the
death
of
his
grandmother
he
was
in
the
enjoyment
of
a
considerable
fortune
and
was
less
bent
on
amusing
himself
than
on
being
distinguished
from
others
not
being
the
same
as
everyone
else
in
short
on
having
the
proper
stamp
this
was
his
favourite
phrase
however
it
was
now
midday
and
they
were
all
yawning
frederick
was
waiting
for
some
one
at
the
mention
of
arnoux
name
pellerin
made
a
wry
face
he
looked
on
him
as
a
renegade
since
he
had
abandoned
the
fine
arts
suppose
we
pass
over
him
what
do
you
say
to
that
they
all
approved
of
this
suggestion
the
door
was
opened
by
a
in
long
gaiters
and
the
could
be
seen
with
its
lofty
oak
plinths
relieved
with
gold
and
its
two
sideboards
laden
with
plate
the
bottles
of
wine
were
heating
on
the
stove
the
blades
of
new
knives
were
glittering
beside
oysters
in
the
milky
tint
of
the
enamelled
glasses
there
was
a
kind
of
alluring
sweetness
and
the
table
disappeared
from
view
under
its
load
of
game
fruit
and
meats
of
the
rarest
quality
these
attentions
were
lost
on
sénécal
he
began
by
asking
for
household
bread
the
hardest
that
could
be
got
and
in
connection
with
this
subject
spoke
of
the
murders
of
buzançais
and
the
crisis
arising
from
lack
of
the
means
of
subsistence
nothing
of
this
sort
could
have
happened
if
agriculture
had
been
better
protected
if
everything
had
not
been
given
up
to
competition
to
anarchy
and
to
the
deplorable
maxim
of
let
things
alone
let
things
go
their
own
way
it
was
in
this
way
that
the
feudalism
of
money
was
established
the
worst
form
of
feudalism
but
let
them
take
care
the
people
in
the
end
will
get
tired
of
it
and
may
make
the
capitalist
pay
for
their
sufferings
either
by
bloody
proscriptions
or
by
the
plunder
of
their
houses
frederick
saw
as
if
by
a
a
flood
of
men
with
bare
arms
invading
madame
dambreuse
and
smashing
the
mirrors
with
blows
of
pikes
sénécal
went
on
to
say
that
the
workman
owing
to
the
insufficiency
of
wages
was
more
unfortunate
than
the
helot
the
negro
and
the
pariah
especially
if
he
has
children
ought
he
to
get
rid
of
them
by
asphyxia
as
some
english
doctor
whose
name
i
do
remember
a
disciple
of
malthus
advises
him
and
turning
towards
cisy
are
we
to
be
obliged
to
follow
the
advice
of
the
infamous
malthus
cisy
who
was
ignorant
of
the
infamy
and
even
of
the
existence
of
malthus
said
by
way
of
reply
that
after
all
much
human
misery
was
relieved
and
that
the
higher
classes
ha
the
higher
classes
said
the
socialist
with
a
sneer
in
the
first
place
there
are
no
higher
classes
is
the
heart
alone
that
makes
anyone
higher
than
another
we
want
no
alms
understand
but
equality
the
fair
division
of
products
what
he
required
was
that
the
workman
might
become
a
capitalist
just
as
the
soldier
might
become
a
colonel
the
at
least
in
limiting
the
number
of
apprentices
prevented
workmen
from
growing
inconveniently
numerous
and
the
sentiment
of
fraternity
was
kept
up
by
means
of
the
fêtes
and
the
banners
hussonnet
as
a
poet
regretted
the
banners
so
did
pellerin
too
a
predilection
which
had
taken
possession
of
him
at
the
café
dagneaux
while
listening
to
the
phalansterians
talking
he
expressed
the
opinion
that
fourier
was
a
great
man
come
now
said
deslauriers
an
old
fool
who
sees
in
the
overthrow
of
governments
the
effects
of
divine
vengeance
he
is
just
like
my
lord
and
his
church
with
his
hatred
of
the
french
revolution
a
set
of
buffoons
who
would
fain
catholicism
de
cisy
no
doubt
in
order
to
get
information
or
to
make
a
good
impression
broke
in
with
this
remark
which
he
uttered
in
a
mild
tone
these
two
men
of
science
are
not
then
of
the
same
way
of
thinking
as
voltaire
that
fellow
i
make
you
a
present
of
him
how
is
that
why
i
thought
oh
no
he
did
not
love
the
people
then
the
conversation
came
down
to
contemporary
events
the
spanish
marriages
the
dilapidations
of
rochefort
the
new
of
which
had
led
to
the
taxes
being
doubled
nevertheless
according
to
sénécal
they
were
not
high
enough
and
why
are
they
paid
my
god
to
erect
the
palace
for
apes
at
the
museum
to
make
showy
parade
along
our
squares
or
to
maintain
a
gothic
etiquette
amongst
the
flunkeys
of
the
château
i
have
read
in
the
said
cisy
that
at
the
tuileries
ball
on
the
feast
of
everyone
was
disguised
as
a
miser
how
pitiable
said
the
socialist
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
as
if
to
indicate
his
disgust
and
the
museum
of
versailles
exclaimed
pellerin
let
us
talk
about
it
these
idiots
have
foreshortened
a
delacroix
and
lengthened
a
gros
at
the
louvre
they
have
so
well
restored
scratched
and
made
a
jumble
of
all
the
canvases
that
in
ten
years
probably
not
one
will
be
left
as
for
the
errors
in
the
catalogue
a
german
has
written
a
whole
volume
on
the
subject
upon
my
word
the
foreigners
are
laughing
at
us
yes
we
are
the
of
europe
said
sénécal
is
because
art
is
conveyed
in
to
the
crown
as
long
as
you
have
universal
suffrage
allow
me
for
the
artist
having
been
rejected
at
every
for
the
last
twenty
years
was
filled
with
rage
against
power
ah
let
them
not
bother
us
as
for
me
i
ask
for
nothing
only
the
chambers
ought
to
pass
enactments
in
the
interests
of
art
a
chair
of
æsthetics
should
be
established
with
a
professor
who
being
a
practical
man
as
well
as
a
philosopher
would
succeed
i
hope
in
grouping
the
multitude
you
would
do
well
hussonnet
to
touch
on
this
matter
with
a
word
or
two
in
your
newspaper
are
the
newspapers
free
are
we
ourselves
free
said
deslauriers
in
an
angry
tone
when
one
reflects
that
there
might
be
as
many
as
different
formalities
to
set
up
a
boat
on
the
river
it
makes
me
feel
a
longing
to
go
and
live
amongst
the
cannibals
the
government
is
eating
us
up
everything
belongs
to
it
philosophy
law
the
arts
the
very
air
of
heaven
and
france
bereft
of
all
energy
lies
under
the
boot
of
the
gendarme
and
the
cassock
of
the
with
the
in
her
throat
the
future
mirabeau
thus
poured
out
his
bile
in
abundance
finally
he
took
his
glass
in
his
right
hand
raised
it
and
with
his
other
arm
akimbo
and
his
eyes
flashing
i
drink
to
the
utter
destruction
of
the
existing
order
of
things
that
is
to
say
of
everything
included
in
the
words
privilege
monopoly
regulation
hierarchy
authority
state
and
in
a
louder
voice
which
i
would
like
to
smash
as
i
do
this
dashing
on
the
table
the
beautiful
which
broke
into
a
thousand
pieces
they
all
applauded
and
especially
dussardier
the
spectacle
of
injustices
made
his
heart
leap
up
with
indignation
everything
that
wore
a
beard
claimed
his
sympathy
he
was
one
of
those
persons
who
fling
themselves
under
vehicles
to
relieve
the
horses
who
have
fallen
his
erudition
was
limited
to
two
works
one
entitled
of
and
the
other
of
the
he
had
listened
to
the
advocate
with
delight
at
length
unable
to
stand
it
any
longer
for
my
part
the
thing
i
blame
louis
philippe
for
is
abandoning
the
poles
one
moment
said
hussonnet
in
the
first
place
poland
has
no
existence
is
an
invention
of
lafayette
the
poles
as
a
general
rule
all
belong
to
the
faubourg
the
real
ones
having
been
drowned
with
poniatowski
in
short
he
no
longer
gave
into
it
he
had
got
over
all
that
sort
of
thing
it
was
just
like
the
the
revocation
of
the
edict
of
nantes
and
that
antiquated
about
the
massacre
sénécal
while
he
did
not
defend
the
poles
extolled
the
latest
remarks
made
by
the
men
of
letters
the
popes
had
been
calumniated
inasmuch
as
they
at
any
rate
defended
the
people
and
he
called
the
league
the
aurora
of
democracy
a
great
movement
in
the
direction
of
equality
as
opposed
to
the
individualism
of
protestants
frederick
was
a
little
surprised
at
these
views
they
probably
bored
cisy
for
he
changed
the
conversation
to
the
at
the
gymnase
which
at
that
time
attracted
a
great
number
of
people
sénécal
regarded
them
with
disfavour
such
exhibitions
corrupted
the
daughters
of
the
proletariat
then
it
was
noticeable
that
they
went
in
for
a
display
of
shameless
luxury
therefore
he
approved
of
the
conduct
of
the
bavarian
students
who
insulted
lola
montès
in
imitation
of
rousseau
he
showed
more
esteem
for
the
wife
of
a
than
for
the
mistress
of
a
king
you
do
appreciate
dainties
retorted
hussonnet
in
a
majestic
tone
and
he
took
up
the
championship
of
ladies
of
this
class
in
order
to
praise
rosanette
then
as
he
happened
to
make
an
allusion
to
the
ball
at
her
house
and
to
arnoux
costume
pellerin
remarked
people
maintain
that
he
is
becoming
shaky
the
had
just
been
engaged
in
a
lawsuit
with
reference
to
his
grounds
at
belleville
and
he
was
actually
in
a
kaolin
company
in
lower
brittany
with
other
rogues
of
the
same
sort
dussardier
knew
more
about
him
for
his
own
master
moussinot
having
made
enquiries
about
arnoux
from
the
banker
oscar
lefébvre
the
latter
had
said
in
reply
that
he
considered
him
by
no
means
solvent
as
he
knew
about
bills
of
his
that
had
been
renewed
the
dessert
was
over
they
passed
into
the
which
was
hung
like
that
of
the
maréchale
in
yellow
damask
in
the
style
of
louis
xvi
pellerin
found
fault
with
frederick
for
not
having
chosen
in
preference
the
style
sénécal
rubbed
matches
against
the
hangings
deslauriers
did
not
make
any
remark
there
was
a
bookcase
set
up
there
which
he
called
a
little
library
the
principal
contemporary
writers
were
to
be
found
there
it
was
impossible
to
speak
about
their
works
for
hussonnet
immediately
began
relating
anecdotes
with
reference
to
their
personal
characteristics
criticising
their
faces
their
habits
their
dress
glorifying
intellects
and
disparaging
those
of
the
first
and
all
the
while
making
it
clear
that
he
deplored
modern
decadence
he
instanced
some
village
ditty
as
containing
in
itself
alone
more
poetry
than
all
the
lyrics
of
the
nineteenth
century
he
went
on
to
say
that
balzac
was
overrated
that
byron
was
effaced
and
that
hugo
knew
nothing
about
the
stage
why
then
said
sénécal
have
you
not
got
the
volumes
of
the
poets
and
de
cisy
who
devoted
his
attention
to
literature
was
astonished
at
not
seeing
on
frederick
table
some
of
those
new
physiological
studies
the
physiology
of
the
smoker
of
the
angler
of
the
man
employed
at
the
barrier
they
went
on
irritating
him
to
such
an
extent
that
he
felt
a
longing
to
shove
them
out
by
the
shoulders
but
they
are
making
me
quite
stupid
and
then
he
drew
dussardier
aside
and
wished
to
know
whether
he
could
do
him
any
service
the
honest
fellow
was
moved
he
answered
that
his
post
of
cashier
entirely
sufficed
for
his
wants
after
that
frederick
led
deslauriers
into
his
own
apartment
and
taking
out
of
his
escritoire
two
thousand
francs
look
here
old
boy
put
this
money
in
your
pocket
is
the
balance
of
my
old
debts
to
you
but
what
about
the
journal
said
the
advocate
you
are
of
course
aware
that
i
spoke
about
it
to
hussonnet
and
when
frederick
replied
that
he
was
a
little
short
of
cash
just
now
the
other
smiled
in
a
sinister
fashion
after
the
liqueurs
they
drank
beer
and
after
the
beer
grog
and
then
they
lighted
their
pipes
once
more
at
last
they
left
at
five
in
the
evening
and
they
were
walking
along
at
each
others
side
without
speaking
when
dussardier
broke
the
silence
by
saying
that
frederick
had
entertained
them
in
excellent
style
they
all
agreed
with
him
on
that
point
then
hussonnet
remarked
that
his
luncheon
was
too
heavy
sénécal
found
fault
with
the
trivial
character
of
his
household
arrangements
cisy
took
the
same
view
it
was
absolutely
devoid
of
the
proper
stamp
for
my
part
i
think
said
pellerin
he
might
have
had
the
grace
to
give
me
an
order
for
a
picture
deslauriers
held
his
tongue
as
he
had
the
that
had
been
given
to
him
in
his
breeches
pocket
frederick
was
left
by
himself
he
was
thinking
about
his
friends
and
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
a
huge
ditch
surrounded
with
shade
separated
him
from
them
he
had
nevertheless
held
out
his
hand
to
them
and
they
had
not
responded
to
the
sincerity
of
his
heart
he
recalled
to
mind
what
pellerin
and
dussardier
had
said
about
arnoux
undoubtedly
it
must
be
an
invention
a
calumny
but
why
and
he
had
a
vision
of
madame
arnoux
ruined
weeping
selling
her
furniture
this
idea
tormented
him
all
night
long
next
day
he
presented
himself
at
her
house
at
a
loss
to
find
any
way
of
communicating
to
her
what
he
had
heard
he
asked
her
as
if
in
casual
conversation
whether
arnoux
still
held
possession
of
his
building
grounds
at
belleville
yes
he
has
them
still
he
is
now
i
believe
a
shareholder
in
a
kaolin
company
in
brittany
that
true
his
are
going
on
very
well
are
they
not
well
i
suppose
so
and
as
he
hesitated
what
is
the
matter
with
you
you
frighten
me
he
told
her
the
story
about
the
renewals
she
hung
down
her
head
and
said
i
thought
so
in
fact
arnoux
in
order
to
make
a
good
speculation
had
refused
to
sell
his
grounds
had
borrowed
money
extensively
on
them
and
finding
no
purchasers
had
thought
of
rehabilitating
himself
by
establishing
the
earthenware
manufactory
the
expense
of
this
had
exceeded
his
calculations
she
knew
nothing
more
about
it
he
evaded
all
her
questions
and
declared
repeatedly
that
it
was
going
on
very
well
frederick
tried
to
reassure
her
these
in
all
probability
were
mere
temporary
embarrassments
however
if
he
got
any
information
he
would
impart
it
to
her
oh
yes
will
you
not
said
she
clasping
her
two
hands
with
an
air
of
charming
supplication
so
then
he
had
it
in
his
power
to
be
useful
to
her
he
was
now
entering
into
her
existence
finding
a
place
in
her
heart
arnoux
appeared
ha
how
nice
of
you
to
come
to
take
me
out
to
dine
frederick
was
silent
on
hearing
these
words
arnoux
spoke
about
general
topics
then
informed
his
wife
that
he
would
be
returning
home
very
late
as
he
had
an
appointment
with
oudry
at
his
house
why
certainly
at
his
house
as
they
went
down
the
stairs
he
confessed
that
as
the
maréchale
had
no
engagement
at
home
they
were
going
on
a
secret
to
the
moulin
rouge
and
as
he
always
needed
somebody
to
be
the
recipient
of
his
outpourings
he
got
frederick
to
drive
him
to
the
door
in
place
of
entering
he
walked
about
on
the
footpath
looking
up
at
the
windows
on
the
second
floor
suddenly
the
curtains
parted
ha
bravo
père
oudry
is
no
longer
there
good
evening
frederick
did
not
know
what
to
think
now
from
this
day
forth
arnoux
was
still
more
cordial
than
before
he
invited
the
young
man
to
dine
with
his
mistress
and
ere
long
frederick
frequented
both
houses
at
the
same
time
rosanette
abode
furnished
him
with
amusement
he
used
to
call
there
of
an
evening
on
his
way
back
from
the
club
or
the
play
he
would
take
a
cup
of
tea
there
or
play
a
game
of
loto
on
sundays
they
played
charades
rosanette
more
noisy
than
the
rest
made
herself
conspicuous
by
funny
tricks
such
as
running
on
or
muffling
her
head
in
a
cotton
cap
in
order
to
watch
the
through
the
window
she
had
a
hat
of
waxed
leather
she
smoked
chibouks
she
sang
tyrolese
airs
in
the
afternoon
to
kill
time
she
cut
out
flowers
in
a
piece
of
chintz
and
pasted
them
against
the
smeared
her
two
little
dogs
with
varnish
burned
pastilles
or
drew
cards
to
tell
her
fortune
incapable
of
resisting
a
desire
she
became
infatuated
about
some
trinket
which
she
happened
to
see
and
could
not
sleep
till
she
had
gone
and
bought
it
then
bartered
it
for
another
sold
costly
dresses
for
little
or
nothing
lost
her
jewellery
squandered
money
and
would
have
sold
her
chemise
for
a
at
the
theatre
often
she
asked
frederick
to
explain
to
her
some
word
she
came
across
when
reading
a
book
but
did
not
pay
any
attention
to
his
answer
for
she
jumped
quickly
to
another
idea
while
heaping
questions
on
top
of
each
other
after
spasms
of
gaiety
came
childish
outbursts
of
rage
or
else
she
sat
on
the
ground
dreaming
before
the
fire
with
her
head
down
and
her
hands
clasping
her
knees
more
inert
than
a
torpid
adder
without
minding
it
she
made
her
toilet
in
his
presence
drew
on
her
silk
stockings
then
washed
her
face
with
great
splashes
of
water
throwing
back
her
figure
as
if
she
were
a
shivering
naiad
and
her
laughing
white
teeth
her
sparkling
eyes
her
beauty
her
gaiety
dazzled
frederick
and
made
his
nerves
tingle
under
the
lash
of
desire
nearly
always
he
found
madame
arnoux
teaching
her
little
boy
how
to
read
or
standing
behind
marthe
chair
while
she
played
her
scales
on
the
piano
when
she
was
doing
a
piece
of
sewing
it
was
a
great
source
of
delight
to
him
to
pick
up
her
scissors
now
and
then
in
all
her
movements
there
was
a
tranquil
majesty
her
little
hands
seemed
made
to
scatter
alms
and
to
wipe
away
tears
and
her
voice
naturally
rather
hollow
had
caressing
intonations
and
a
sort
of
breezy
lightness
she
did
not
display
much
enthusiasm
about
literature
but
her
intelligence
exercised
a
charm
by
the
use
of
a
few
simple
and
penetrating
words
she
loved
travelling
the
sound
of
the
wind
in
the
woods
and
a
walk
with
uncovered
head
under
the
rain
frederick
listened
to
these
confidences
with
rapture
fancying
that
he
saw
in
them
the
beginning
of
a
certain
on
her
part
his
association
with
these
two
women
made
as
it
were
two
different
strains
of
music
in
his
life
the
one
playful
passionate
diverting
the
other
grave
and
almost
religious
and
vibrating
both
at
the
same
time
they
always
increased
in
volume
and
gradually
blended
with
one
another
for
if
madame
arnoux
happened
merely
to
touch
him
with
her
finger
the
image
of
the
other
immediately
presented
itself
to
him
as
an
object
of
desire
because
from
that
quarter
a
better
opportunity
was
thrown
in
his
way
and
when
his
heart
happened
to
be
touched
while
in
rosanette
company
he
was
immediately
reminded
of
the
woman
for
whom
he
felt
such
a
consuming
passion
this
confusion
was
in
some
measure
due
to
a
similarity
which
existed
between
the
interiors
of
the
two
houses
one
of
the
trunks
which
was
formerly
to
be
seen
in
the
boulevard
montmartre
now
adorned
the
same
courses
were
served
up
for
dinner
in
both
places
and
even
the
same
velvet
cap
was
to
be
found
trailing
over
the
then
a
heap
of
little
presents
screens
boxes
fans
went
to
the
mistress
house
from
the
wife
and
returned
again
for
arnoux
without
the
slightest
embarrassment
often
took
back
from
the
one
what
he
had
given
to
her
in
order
to
make
a
present
of
it
to
the
other
the
maréchale
laughed
with
frederick
at
the
utter
disregard
for
propriety
which
his
habits
exhibited
one
sunday
after
dinner
she
led
him
behind
the
door
and
showed
him
in
the
pocket
of
arnoux
overcoat
a
bag
of
cakes
which
he
had
just
pilfered
from
the
table
in
order
no
doubt
to
regale
his
little
family
with
it
at
home
arnoux
gave
himself
up
to
some
rogueries
which
bordered
on
vileness
it
seemed
to
him
a
duty
to
practise
fraud
with
regard
to
the
city
dues
he
never
paid
when
he
went
to
the
theatre
or
if
he
took
a
ticket
for
the
second
seats
always
tried
to
make
his
way
into
the
first
and
he
used
to
relate
as
an
excellent
joke
that
it
was
a
custom
of
his
at
the
cold
baths
to
put
into
the
waiters
a
breeches
button
instead
of
a
piece
and
this
did
not
prevent
the
maréchale
from
loving
him
one
day
however
she
said
while
talking
about
him
ah
he
making
himself
a
nuisance
to
me
at
last
i
had
enough
of
him
faith
so
much
the
better
i
find
another
instead
frederick
believed
that
the
other
had
already
been
found
and
that
his
name
was
oudry
well
said
rosanette
what
does
that
signify
then
in
a
voice
choked
with
rising
tears
i
ask
very
little
from
him
however
and
he
wo
give
me
that
he
had
even
promised
a
fourth
of
his
profits
in
the
famous
kaolin
mines
no
profit
made
its
appearance
any
more
than
the
cashmere
with
which
he
had
been
luring
her
on
for
the
last
six
months
frederick
immediately
thought
of
making
her
a
present
arnoux
might
regard
it
as
a
lesson
for
himself
and
be
annoyed
at
it
for
all
that
he
was
his
wife
herself
said
so
but
so
foolish
instead
of
bringing
people
to
dine
every
day
at
his
house
he
now
entertained
his
acquaintances
at
a
restaurant
he
bought
things
that
were
utterly
useless
such
as
gold
chains
timepieces
and
household
articles
madame
arnoux
even
pointed
out
to
frederick
in
the
lobby
an
enormous
supply
of
and
samovars
finally
she
one
day
confessed
that
a
certain
matter
caused
her
much
anxiety
arnoux
had
made
her
sign
a
promissory
note
payable
to
dambreuse
meanwhile
frederick
still
cherished
his
literary
projects
as
if
it
were
a
point
of
honour
with
himself
to
do
so
he
wished
to
write
a
history
of
æsthetics
a
result
of
his
conversations
with
pellerin
next
to
write
dramas
dealing
with
different
epochs
of
the
french
revolution
and
to
compose
a
great
comedy
an
idea
traceable
to
the
indirect
influence
of
deslauriers
and
hussonnet
in
the
midst
of
his
work
her
face
or
that
of
the
other
passed
before
his
mental
vision
he
struggled
against
the
longing
to
see
her
but
was
not
long
ere
he
yielded
to
it
and
he
felt
sadder
as
he
came
back
from
madame
arnoux
house
one
morning
while
he
was
brooding
over
his
melancholy
thoughts
by
the
fireside
deslauriers
came
in
the
incendiary
speeches
of
sénécal
had
filled
his
master
with
uneasiness
and
once
more
he
found
himself
without
resources
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
said
frederick
nothing
i
know
you
have
no
money
but
it
will
not
be
much
trouble
for
you
to
get
him
a
post
either
through
dambreuse
or
else
through
arnoux
the
latter
ought
to
have
need
of
engineers
in
his
establishment
frederick
had
an
inspiration
sénécal
would
be
able
to
let
him
know
when
the
husband
was
away
carry
letters
for
him
and
assist
him
on
a
thousand
occasions
when
opportunities
presented
themselves
services
of
this
sort
are
always
rendered
between
man
and
man
besides
he
would
find
means
of
employing
him
without
arousing
any
suspicion
on
his
part
chance
offered
him
an
auxiliary
it
was
a
circumstance
that
omened
well
for
the
future
and
he
hastened
to
take
advantage
of
it
and
with
an
affectation
of
indifference
he
replied
that
the
thing
was
feasible
perhaps
and
that
he
would
devote
attention
to
it
and
he
did
so
at
once
arnoux
took
a
great
deal
of
pains
with
his
earthenware
works
he
was
endeavouring
to
discover
the
of
the
chinese
but
his
colours
evaporated
in
the
process
of
baking
in
order
to
avoid
cracks
in
his
ware
he
mixed
lime
with
his
potter
clay
but
the
articles
got
broken
for
the
most
part
the
enamel
of
his
paintings
on
the
raw
material
boiled
away
his
large
plates
became
bulged
and
attributing
these
mischances
to
the
inferior
plant
of
his
manufactory
he
was
anxious
to
start
other
and
other
frederick
recalled
some
of
these
things
to
mind
and
when
he
met
arnoux
said
that
he
had
discovered
a
very
able
man
who
would
be
capable
of
finding
his
famous
red
arnoux
gave
a
jump
then
having
listened
to
what
the
young
man
had
to
tell
him
replied
that
he
wanted
assistance
from
nobody
frederick
spoke
in
a
very
laudatory
style
about
sénécal
prodigious
attainments
pointing
out
that
he
was
at
the
same
time
an
engineer
a
chemist
and
an
accountant
being
a
mathematician
of
the
first
rank
the
consented
to
see
him
but
they
squabbled
over
the
emoluments
frederick
interposed
and
at
the
end
of
a
week
succeeded
in
getting
them
to
come
to
an
agreement
but
as
the
works
were
situated
at
creil
sénécal
could
not
assist
him
in
any
way
this
thought
alone
was
enough
to
make
his
courage
flag
as
if
he
had
met
with
some
misfortune
his
notion
was
that
the
more
arnoux
would
be
kept
apart
from
his
wife
the
better
would
be
his
own
chance
with
her
then
he
proceeded
to
make
repeated
apologies
for
rosanette
he
referred
to
all
the
wrongs
she
had
sustained
at
the
other
hands
referred
to
the
vague
threats
which
she
had
uttered
a
few
days
before
and
even
spoke
about
the
cashmere
without
concealing
the
fact
that
she
had
accused
arnoux
of
avarice
arnoux
nettled
at
the
word
and
furthermore
feeling
some
uneasiness
brought
rosanette
the
cashmere
but
scolded
her
for
having
made
any
complaint
to
frederick
when
she
told
him
that
she
had
reminded
him
a
hundred
times
of
his
promise
he
pretended
that
owing
to
pressure
of
business
he
had
forgotten
all
about
it
the
next
day
frederick
presented
himself
at
her
abode
and
found
the
maréchale
still
in
bed
though
it
was
two
with
delmar
beside
her
finishing
a
de
foie
at
a
little
round
table
before
he
had
advanced
many
paces
she
broke
out
into
a
cry
of
delight
saying
i
have
him
i
have
him
then
she
seized
him
by
the
ears
kissed
him
on
the
forehead
thanked
him
effusively
thee
and
thou
him
and
even
wanted
to
make
him
sit
down
on
the
bed
her
fine
eyes
full
of
tender
emotion
were
sparkling
with
pleasure
there
was
a
smile
on
her
humid
mouth
her
two
round
arms
emerged
through
the
sleeveless
opening
of
her
and
from
time
to
time
he
could
feel
through
the
cambric
the
outlines
of
her
form
illustration
then
she
seized
him
by
the
ears
and
kissed
him
all
this
time
delmar
kept
rolling
his
eyeballs
about
but
really
my
dear
my
own
pet
it
was
the
same
way
on
the
occasion
when
he
saw
her
next
as
soon
as
frederick
entered
she
sat
up
on
a
cushion
in
order
to
embrace
him
with
more
ease
called
him
a
darling
a
dearie
put
a
flower
in
his
and
settled
his
cravat
these
delicate
attentions
were
redoubled
when
delmar
happened
to
be
there
were
they
advances
on
her
part
so
it
seemed
to
frederick
as
for
deceiving
a
friend
arnoux
in
his
place
would
not
have
had
many
scruples
on
that
score
and
he
had
every
right
not
to
adhere
to
rigidly
virtuous
principles
with
regard
to
this
man
mistress
seeing
that
his
relations
with
the
wife
had
been
strictly
honourable
for
so
he
thought
or
rather
he
would
have
liked
arnoux
to
think
so
in
any
event
as
a
sort
of
justification
of
his
own
prodigious
cowardice
nevertheless
he
felt
somewhat
bewildered
and
presently
he
made
up
his
mind
to
lay
siege
boldly
to
the
maréchale
so
one
afternoon
just
as
she
was
stooping
down
in
front
of
her
chest
of
drawers
he
came
across
to
her
and
repeated
his
overtures
without
a
pause
thereupon
she
began
to
cry
saying
that
she
was
very
unfortunate
but
that
people
should
not
despise
her
on
that
account
he
only
made
fresh
advances
she
now
adopted
a
different
plan
namely
to
laugh
at
his
attempts
without
stopping
he
thought
it
a
clever
thing
to
answer
her
sarcasms
with
repartees
in
the
same
strain
in
which
there
was
even
a
touch
of
exaggeration
but
he
made
too
great
a
display
of
gaiety
to
convince
her
that
he
was
in
earnest
and
their
comradeship
was
an
impediment
to
any
outpouring
of
serious
feeling
at
last
when
she
said
one
day
in
reply
to
his
amorous
whispers
that
she
would
not
take
another
woman
leavings
he
answered
what
other
woman
ah
yes
go
and
meet
madame
arnoux
again
for
frederick
used
to
talk
about
her
often
arnoux
on
his
side
had
the
same
mania
at
last
she
lost
patience
at
always
hearing
this
praises
sung
and
her
insinuation
was
a
kind
of
revenge
frederick
resented
it
however
rosanette
was
beginning
to
excite
his
love
to
an
unusual
degree
sometimes
assuming
the
attitude
of
a
woman
of
experience
she
spoke
ill
of
love
with
a
sceptical
smile
that
made
him
feel
inclined
to
box
her
ears
a
quarter
of
an
hour
afterwards
it
was
the
only
thing
of
any
consequence
in
the
world
and
with
her
arms
crossed
over
her
breast
as
if
she
were
clasping
some
one
close
to
her
oh
yes
is
good
is
good
and
her
eyelids
would
quiver
in
a
kind
of
rapturous
swoon
it
was
impossible
to
understand
her
to
know
for
instance
whether
she
loved
arnoux
for
she
made
fun
of
him
and
yet
seemed
jealous
of
him
so
likewise
with
the
vatnaz
whom
she
would
sometimes
call
a
wretch
and
at
other
times
her
best
friend
in
short
there
was
about
her
entire
person
even
to
the
very
arrangement
of
her
chignon
over
her
head
an
inexpressible
something
which
seemed
like
a
challenge
and
he
desired
her
for
the
satisfaction
above
all
of
conquering
her
and
being
her
master
how
was
he
to
accomplish
this
for
she
often
sent
him
away
unceremoniously
appearing
only
for
a
moment
between
two
doors
in
order
to
say
in
a
subdued
voice
i
engaged
for
the
evening
or
else
he
found
her
surrounded
by
a
dozen
persons
and
when
they
were
alone
so
many
impediments
presented
themselves
one
after
the
other
that
one
would
have
sworn
there
was
a
bet
to
keep
matters
from
going
any
further
he
invited
her
to
dinner
as
a
rule
she
declined
the
invitation
on
one
occasion
she
accepted
it
but
did
not
come
a
machiavellian
idea
arose
in
his
brain
having
heard
from
dussardier
about
pellerin
complaints
against
himself
he
thought
of
giving
the
artist
an
order
to
paint
the
maréchale
portrait
a
portrait
which
would
necessitate
a
good
number
of
sittings
he
would
not
fail
to
be
present
at
all
of
them
the
habitual
incorrectness
of
the
painter
would
facilitate
their
private
conversations
so
then
he
would
urge
rosanette
to
get
the
picture
executed
in
order
to
make
a
present
of
her
face
to
her
dear
arnoux
she
consented
for
she
saw
herself
in
the
midst
of
the
grand
salon
in
the
most
prominent
position
with
a
crowd
of
people
staring
at
her
picture
and
the
newspapers
would
all
talk
about
it
which
at
once
would
set
her
afloat
as
for
pellerin
he
eagerly
snatched
at
the
offer
this
portrait
ought
to
place
him
in
the
position
of
a
great
man
it
ought
to
be
a
masterpiece
he
passed
in
review
in
his
memory
all
the
portraits
by
great
masters
with
which
he
was
acquainted
and
decided
finally
in
favour
of
a
titian
which
would
be
set
off
with
ornaments
in
the
style
of
veronese
therefore
he
would
carry
out
his
design
without
artificial
backgrounds
in
a
bold
light
which
would
illuminate
the
with
a
single
tone
and
which
would
make
the
accessories
glitter
suppose
i
were
to
put
on
her
he
thought
a
pink
silk
dress
with
an
oriental
bournous
oh
no
the
bournous
is
only
a
rascally
thing
or
suppose
rather
i
were
to
make
her
wear
blue
velvet
with
a
grey
background
richly
coloured
we
might
likewise
give
her
a
white
guipure
collar
with
a
black
fan
and
a
scarlet
curtain
behind
and
thus
seeking
for
ideas
he
enlarged
his
conception
and
regarded
it
with
admiration
he
felt
his
heart
beating
when
rosanette
accompanied
by
frederick
called
at
his
house
for
the
first
sitting
he
placed
her
standing
up
on
a
sort
of
platform
in
the
midst
of
the
apartment
and
finding
fault
with
the
light
and
expressing
regret
at
the
loss
of
his
former
studio
he
first
made
her
lean
on
her
elbow
against
a
pedestal
then
sit
down
in
an
armchair
and
drawing
away
from
her
and
coming
near
her
again
by
turns
in
order
to
adjust
with
a
fillip
the
folds
of
her
dress
he
watched
her
with
eyelids
and
appealed
to
frederick
taste
with
a
passing
word
well
no
he
exclaimed
i
return
to
my
own
idea
i
will
set
you
up
in
the
venetian
style
she
would
have
a
velvet
gown
with
a
jewelled
girdle
and
her
wide
sleeve
lined
with
ermine
would
afford
a
glimpse
of
her
bare
arm
which
was
to
touch
the
balustrade
of
a
staircase
rising
behind
her
at
her
left
a
large
column
would
mount
as
far
as
the
top
of
the
canvas
to
meet
certain
structures
so
as
to
form
an
arch
underneath
one
would
vaguely
distinguish
groups
of
almost
black
through
which
the
blue
sky
with
its
streaks
of
white
cloud
would
seem
cut
into
fragments
on
the
baluster
covered
with
a
carpet
there
would
be
on
a
silver
dish
a
bouquet
of
flowers
a
chaplet
of
amber
a
poniard
and
a
little
chest
of
antique
ivory
rather
yellow
with
age
which
would
appear
to
be
disgorging
gold
sequins
some
of
them
falling
on
the
ground
here
and
there
would
form
brilliant
splashes
as
it
were
in
such
a
way
as
to
direct
one
glance
towards
the
tip
of
her
foot
for
she
would
be
standing
on
the
last
step
but
one
in
a
natural
position
as
if
in
the
act
of
moving
under
the
glow
of
the
broad
sunlight
he
went
to
look
for
a
which
he
laid
on
the
platform
to
represent
the
step
then
he
arranged
as
accessories
on
a
stool
by
way
of
balustrade
his
a
buckler
a
a
bundle
of
pens
and
a
knife
and
when
he
had
flung
in
front
of
rosanette
a
dozen
big
sous
he
made
her
assume
the
attitude
he
required
just
try
to
imagine
that
these
things
are
riches
magnificent
presents
the
head
a
little
on
one
side
perfect
and
do
stir
this
majestic
posture
exactly
suits
your
style
of
beauty
she
wore
a
plaid
dress
and
carried
a
big
muff
and
only
kept
from
laughing
outright
by
an
effort
of
as
regards
the
we
will
mingle
with
it
a
circle
of
pearls
it
always
produces
a
striking
effect
with
red
hair
the
maréchale
burst
out
into
an
exclamation
remarking
that
she
had
not
red
hair
nonsense
the
red
of
painters
is
not
that
of
ordinary
people
he
began
to
sketch
the
position
of
the
masses
and
he
was
so
much
preoccupied
with
the
great
artists
of
the
renaissance
that
he
kept
talking
about
them
persistently
for
a
whole
hour
he
went
on
musing
aloud
on
those
splendid
lives
full
of
genius
glory
and
sumptuous
displays
with
triumphal
entries
into
the
cities
and
galas
by
torchlight
among
women
beautiful
as
goddesses
you
were
made
to
live
in
those
days
a
creature
of
your
calibre
would
have
deserved
a
monseigneur
rosanette
thought
the
compliments
he
paid
her
very
pretty
the
day
was
fixed
for
the
next
sitting
frederick
took
it
on
himself
to
bring
the
accessories
as
the
heat
of
the
stove
had
stupefied
her
a
little
they
went
home
on
foot
through
the
rue
du
bac
and
reached
the
pont
royal
it
was
fine
weather
piercingly
bright
and
warm
some
windows
of
houses
in
the
city
shone
in
the
distance
like
plates
of
gold
whilst
behind
them
at
the
right
the
turrets
of
nôtre
dame
showed
their
outlines
in
black
against
the
blue
sky
softly
bathed
at
the
horizon
in
grey
vapours
the
wind
began
to
swell
and
rosanette
having
declared
that
she
felt
hungry
they
entered
the
patisserie
anglaise
young
women
with
their
children
stood
eating
in
front
of
the
marble
buffet
where
plates
of
little
cakes
had
glass
covers
pressed
down
on
them
rosanette
swallowed
two
the
powdered
sugar
formed
moustaches
at
the
sides
of
her
mouth
from
time
to
time
in
order
to
wipe
it
she
drew
out
her
handkerchief
from
her
muff
and
her
face
under
her
green
silk
hood
resembled
a
rose
in
the
midst
of
its
leaves
they
resumed
their
walk
in
the
rue
de
la
paix
she
stood
before
a
goldsmith
shop
to
look
at
a
bracelet
frederick
wished
to
make
her
a
present
of
it
no
said
she
keep
your
money
he
was
hurt
by
these
words
what
the
matter
now
with
the
ducky
we
are
melancholy
and
the
conversation
having
been
renewed
he
began
making
the
same
protestations
of
love
to
her
as
usual
you
know
well
is
impossible
why
ah
because
they
went
on
side
by
side
she
leaning
on
his
arm
and
the
flounces
of
her
gown
kept
flapping
against
his
legs
then
he
recalled
to
mind
one
winter
twilight
when
on
the
same
footpath
madame
arnoux
walked
thus
by
his
side
and
he
became
so
much
absorbed
in
this
recollection
that
he
no
longer
saw
rosanette
and
did
not
bestow
a
thought
upon
her
she
kept
looking
straight
before
her
in
a
careless
fashion
lagging
a
little
like
a
lazy
child
it
was
the
hour
when
people
had
just
come
back
from
their
promenade
and
equipages
were
making
their
way
at
a
quick
trot
over
the
hard
pavement
pellerin
flatteries
having
probably
recurred
to
her
mind
she
heaved
a
sigh
ah
there
are
some
lucky
women
in
the
world
decidedly
i
was
made
for
a
rich
man
he
replied
with
a
certain
brutality
in
his
tone
you
have
one
in
the
meantime
for
oudry
was
looked
upon
as
a
man
that
could
count
a
million
three
times
over
she
asked
for
nothing
better
than
to
get
free
from
him
what
prevents
you
from
doing
so
and
he
gave
utterance
to
bitter
jests
about
this
old
bewigged
citizen
pointing
out
to
her
that
such
an
intrigue
was
unworthy
of
her
and
that
she
ought
to
break
it
off
yes
replied
the
maréchale
as
if
talking
to
herself
is
what
i
shall
end
by
doing
no
doubt
frederick
was
charmed
by
this
disinterestedness
she
slackened
her
pace
and
he
fancied
that
she
was
fatigued
she
obstinately
refused
to
let
him
take
a
cab
and
she
parted
with
him
at
her
door
sending
him
a
kiss
with
her
ah
what
a
pity
and
to
think
that
imbeciles
take
me
for
a
man
of
wealth
he
reached
home
in
a
gloomy
frame
of
mind
hussonnet
and
deslauriers
were
awaiting
him
the
bohemian
seated
before
the
table
made
sketches
of
turks
heads
and
the
advocate
in
dirty
boots
lay
asleep
on
the
sofa
ha
at
last
he
exclaimed
but
how
sullen
you
look
will
you
listen
to
me
his
vogue
as
a
tutor
had
fallen
off
for
he
crammed
his
pupils
with
theories
unfavourable
for
their
examinations
he
had
appeared
in
two
or
three
cases
in
which
he
had
been
unsuccessful
and
each
new
disappointment
flung
him
back
with
greater
force
on
the
dream
of
his
earlier
days
a
journal
in
which
he
could
show
himself
off
avenge
himself
and
spit
forth
his
bile
and
his
opinions
fortune
and
reputation
moreover
would
follow
as
a
necessary
consequence
it
was
in
this
hope
that
he
had
got
round
the
bohemian
hussonnet
happening
to
be
the
possessor
of
a
press
at
present
he
printed
it
on
pink
paper
he
invented
hoaxes
composed
rebuses
tried
to
engage
in
polemics
and
even
intended
in
spite
of
the
situation
of
the
premises
to
get
up
concerts
a
year
subscription
was
to
give
a
right
to
a
place
in
the
orchestra
in
one
of
the
principal
theatres
of
paris
besides
the
board
of
management
took
on
itself
to
furnish
foreigners
with
all
necessary
information
artistic
and
otherwise
but
the
printer
gave
vent
to
threats
there
were
three
quarters
rent
due
to
the
landlord
all
sorts
of
embarrassments
arose
and
hussonnet
would
have
allowed
to
perish
were
it
not
for
the
exhortations
of
the
advocate
who
kept
every
day
exciting
his
mind
he
had
brought
the
other
with
him
in
order
to
give
more
weight
to
the
application
he
was
now
making
we
come
about
the
journal
said
he
what
are
you
still
thinking
about
that
said
frederick
in
an
absent
tone
certainly
i
am
thinking
about
it
and
he
explained
his
plan
anew
by
means
of
the
bourse
returns
they
would
get
into
communication
with
financiers
and
would
thus
obtain
the
hundred
thousand
francs
indispensable
as
security
but
in
order
that
the
print
might
be
transformed
into
a
political
journal
it
was
necessary
beforehand
to
have
a
large
and
for
that
purpose
to
make
up
their
minds
to
go
to
some
expense
so
much
for
the
cost
of
paper
and
printing
and
for
outlay
at
the
office
in
short
a
sum
of
about
fifteen
thousand
francs
i
have
no
funds
said
frederick
and
what
are
we
to
do
then
said
deslauriers
with
folded
arms
frederick
hurt
by
the
attitude
which
deslauriers
was
assuming
replied
is
that
my
fault
ah
very
fine
a
man
has
wood
in
his
fire
truffles
on
his
table
a
good
bed
a
library
a
carriage
every
kind
of
comfort
but
let
another
man
shiver
under
the
slates
dine
at
twenty
sous
work
like
a
convict
and
sprawl
through
want
in
the
mire
is
it
the
rich
man
fault
and
he
repeated
is
it
the
rich
man
fault
with
a
ciceronian
irony
which
smacked
of
the
frederick
tried
to
speak
however
i
understand
one
has
certain
wants
aristocratic
wants
for
no
doubt
some
woman
well
even
if
that
were
so
am
i
not
free
oh
quite
free
and
after
a
minute
silence
promises
are
so
convenient
good
god
i
do
deny
that
i
gave
them
said
frederick
the
advocate
went
on
at
college
we
take
oaths
we
are
going
to
set
up
a
phalanx
we
are
going
to
imitate
balzac
thirteen
then
on
meeting
a
friend
after
a
separation
night
old
fellow
go
about
your
business
for
he
who
might
help
the
other
carefully
keeps
everything
for
himself
alone
how
is
that
yes
you
have
not
even
introduced
me
to
the
dambreuses
frederick
cast
a
scrutinising
glance
at
him
with
his
shabby
his
spectacles
of
rough
glass
and
his
sallow
face
that
advocate
seemed
to
him
such
a
typical
specimen
of
the
penniless
pedant
that
he
could
not
prevent
his
lips
from
curling
with
a
disdainful
smile
deslauriers
perceived
this
and
reddened
he
had
already
taken
his
hat
to
leave
hussonnet
filled
with
uneasiness
tried
to
mollify
him
with
appealing
looks
and
as
frederick
was
turning
his
back
on
him
look
here
my
boy
become
my
mæcenas
protect
the
arts
frederick
with
an
abrupt
movement
of
resignation
took
a
sheet
of
paper
and
having
scrawled
some
lines
on
it
handed
it
to
him
the
bohemian
face
lighted
up
then
passing
across
the
sheet
of
paper
to
deslauriers
apologise
my
fine
fellow
their
friend
begged
his
notary
to
send
him
fifteen
thousand
francs
as
quickly
as
possible
ah
i
recognise
you
in
that
said
deslauriers
on
the
faith
of
a
gentleman
added
the
bohemian
you
are
a
noble
fellow
you
be
placed
in
the
gallery
of
useful
men
the
advocate
remarked
you
lose
nothing
by
it
is
an
excellent
speculation
faith
exclaimed
hussonnet
i
stake
my
head
at
the
scaffold
on
its
success
and
he
said
so
many
foolish
things
and
promised
so
many
wonderful
things
in
which
perhaps
he
believed
that
frederick
did
not
know
whether
he
did
this
in
order
to
laugh
at
others
or
at
himself
the
same
evening
he
received
a
letter
from
his
mother
she
expressed
astonishment
at
not
seeing
him
yet
a
minister
while
indulging
in
a
little
banter
at
his
expense
then
she
spoke
of
her
health
and
informed
him
that
roque
had
now
become
one
of
her
visitors
since
he
is
a
widower
i
thought
there
would
be
no
objection
to
inviting
him
to
the
house
louise
is
greatly
changed
for
the
better
and
in
a
postscript
you
have
told
me
nothing
about
your
fine
acquaintance
dambreuse
if
i
were
you
i
would
make
use
of
him
why
not
his
intellectual
ambitions
had
left
him
and
his
fortune
he
saw
it
clearly
was
insufficient
for
when
his
debts
had
been
paid
and
the
sum
agreed
on
remitted
to
the
others
his
income
would
be
diminished
by
four
thousand
at
least
moreover
he
felt
the
need
of
giving
up
this
sort
of
life
and
attaching
himself
to
some
pursuit
so
next
day
when
dining
at
madame
arnoux
he
said
that
his
mother
was
tormenting
him
in
order
to
make
him
take
up
a
profession
but
i
was
under
the
impression
she
said
that
dambreuse
was
going
to
get
you
into
the
council
of
state
that
would
suit
you
very
well
so
then
she
wished
him
to
take
this
course
he
regarded
her
wish
as
a
command
the
banker
as
on
the
first
occasion
was
seated
at
his
desk
and
with
a
gesture
intimated
that
he
desired
frederick
to
wait
a
few
minutes
for
a
gentleman
who
was
standing
at
the
door
with
his
back
turned
had
been
discussing
some
serious
topic
with
him
the
subject
of
their
conversation
was
the
proposed
amalgamation
of
the
different
companies
on
each
side
of
the
glass
hung
portraits
of
general
foy
and
louis
philippe
cardboard
shelves
rose
along
the
panels
up
to
the
ceiling
and
there
were
six
straw
chairs
dambreuse
not
requiring
a
more
apartment
for
the
transaction
of
business
it
resembled
those
gloomy
kitchens
in
which
great
banquets
are
prepared
frederick
noticed
particularly
two
chests
of
prodigious
size
which
stood
in
the
corners
he
asked
himself
how
many
millions
they
might
contain
the
banker
unlocked
one
of
them
and
as
the
iron
plate
revolved
it
disclosed
to
view
nothing
inside
but
blue
paper
books
full
of
entries
at
last
the
person
who
had
been
talking
to
dambreuse
passed
in
front
of
frederick
it
was
père
oudry
the
two
saluted
one
another
their
faces
colouring
a
circumstance
which
surprised
dambreuse
however
he
exhibited
the
utmost
affability
observing
that
nothing
would
be
easier
than
to
recommend
the
young
man
to
the
keeper
of
the
seals
they
would
be
too
happy
to
have
him
he
added
concluding
his
polite
attentions
by
inviting
him
to
an
evening
party
which
he
would
be
giving
in
a
few
days
frederick
was
stepping
into
a
brougham
on
his
way
to
this
party
when
a
note
from
the
maréchale
reached
him
by
the
light
of
the
he
read
darling
i
have
followed
your
advice
i
have
just
expelled
my
savage
after
evening
liberty
say
whether
i
am
not
brave
nothing
more
but
it
was
clearly
an
invitation
to
him
to
take
the
vacant
place
he
uttered
an
exclamation
squeezed
the
note
into
his
pocket
and
set
forth
two
municipal
guards
on
horseback
were
stationed
in
the
street
a
row
of
lamps
burned
on
the
two
front
gates
and
some
servants
were
calling
out
in
the
courtyard
to
have
the
carriages
brought
up
to
the
end
of
the
steps
before
the
house
under
the
marquée
then
suddenly
the
noise
in
the
vestibule
ceased
large
trees
filled
up
the
space
in
front
of
the
staircase
the
porcelain
globes
shed
a
light
which
waved
like
white
moiré
satin
on
the
walls
frederick
rushed
up
the
steps
in
a
joyous
frame
of
mind
an
usher
announced
his
name
dambreuse
extended
his
hand
almost
at
the
very
same
moment
madame
dambreuse
appeared
she
wore
a
mauve
dress
trimmed
with
lace
the
ringlets
of
her
hair
were
more
abundant
than
usual
and
not
a
single
jewel
did
she
display
she
complained
of
his
coming
to
visit
them
so
rarely
and
seized
the
opportunity
to
exchange
a
few
confidential
words
with
him
the
guests
began
to
arrive
in
their
mode
of
bowing
they
twisted
their
bodies
on
one
side
or
bent
in
two
or
merely
lowered
their
heads
a
little
then
a
married
pair
a
family
passed
in
and
all
scattered
themselves
about
the
which
was
already
filled
under
the
chandelier
in
the
centre
an
enormous
supported
a
stand
the
flowers
of
which
bending
forward
like
plumes
of
feathers
hung
over
the
heads
of
the
ladies
seated
all
around
in
a
ring
while
others
occupied
the
which
formed
two
straight
lines
symmetrically
interrupted
by
the
large
velvet
curtains
of
the
windows
and
the
lofty
bays
of
the
doors
with
their
gilded
lintels
the
crowd
of
men
who
remained
standing
on
the
floor
with
their
hats
in
their
hands
seemed
at
some
distance
like
one
black
mass
into
which
the
ribbons
in
the
introduced
red
points
here
and
there
and
rendered
all
the
more
dull
the
monotonous
whiteness
of
their
cravats
with
the
exception
of
the
very
young
men
with
the
down
on
their
faces
all
appeared
to
be
bored
some
dandies
with
an
expression
of
sullenness
on
their
countenances
were
swinging
on
their
heels
there
were
numbers
of
men
with
grey
hair
or
wigs
here
and
there
glistened
a
bald
pate
and
the
visages
of
many
of
these
men
either
purple
or
exceedingly
pale
showed
in
their
worn
aspect
the
traces
of
immense
fatigues
for
they
were
persons
who
devoted
themselves
either
to
political
or
commercial
pursuits
dambreuse
had
also
invited
a
number
of
scholars
and
magistrates
two
or
three
celebrated
doctors
and
he
deprecated
with
an
air
of
humility
the
eulogies
which
they
pronounced
on
his
entertainment
and
the
allusions
to
his
wealth
an
immense
number
of
with
fine
livery
kept
moving
about
on
every
side
the
large
branched
candlesticks
like
bouquets
of
flame
threw
a
glow
over
the
hangings
they
were
reflected
in
the
mirrors
and
at
the
bottom
of
the
which
was
adorned
with
a
jessamine
treillage
the
resembled
the
high
altar
of
a
cathedral
or
an
exhibition
of
jewellery
there
were
so
many
dishes
bells
knives
and
forks
silver
and
spoons
in
the
midst
of
crystal
ware
glittering
with
iridescence
the
three
other
overflowed
with
artistic
objects
landscapes
by
great
masters
on
the
walls
ivory
and
porcelain
at
the
sides
of
the
tables
and
chinese
ornaments
on
the
brackets
lacquered
screens
were
displayed
in
front
of
the
windows
clusters
of
camelias
rose
above
the
and
a
light
music
vibrated
in
the
distance
like
the
humming
of
bees
the
quadrilles
were
not
numerous
and
the
dancers
judged
by
the
indifferent
fashion
in
which
they
dragged
their
pumps
after
them
seemed
to
be
going
through
the
performance
of
a
duty
frederick
heard
some
phrases
such
as
the
following
were
you
at
the
last
charity
fête
at
the
hôtel
lambert
mademoiselle
no
monsieur
it
will
soon
be
intolerably
warm
here
oh
yes
indeed
quite
suffocating
whose
polka
pray
is
this
good
heavens
madame
i
do
know
and
behind
him
three
greybeards
who
had
posted
themselves
in
the
recess
of
a
window
were
whispering
some
remarks
a
sportsman
told
a
hunting
story
while
a
legitimist
carried
on
an
argument
with
an
orléanist
and
wandering
about
from
one
group
to
another
he
reached
the
where
in
the
midst
of
men
gathered
in
a
circle
he
recognised
martinon
now
attached
to
the
bar
of
the
capital
his
big
face
with
its
waxen
complexion
filled
up
the
space
encircled
by
his
beard
which
was
a
marvel
with
its
even
surface
of
black
hair
and
observing
the
golden
mean
between
the
elegance
which
his
age
might
yearn
for
and
the
dignity
which
his
profession
exacted
from
him
he
kept
his
thumbs
stuck
under
his
armpits
according
to
the
custom
of
beaux
and
then
put
his
hands
into
his
waistcoat
pockets
after
the
manner
of
learned
personages
though
his
boots
were
polished
to
excess
he
kept
his
temples
shaved
in
order
to
have
the
forehead
of
a
thinker
after
he
had
addressed
a
few
chilling
words
to
frederick
he
turned
once
more
towards
those
who
were
chatting
around
him
a
was
saying
this
is
a
class
of
men
that
dreams
of
upsetting
society
they
are
calling
for
the
organisation
of
labour
said
another
can
this
be
conceived
what
could
you
expect
said
a
third
when
we
see
de
genoude
giving
his
assistance
to
the
and
even
conservatives
style
themselves
progressives
to
lead
us
to
what
to
the
republic
as
if
such
a
thing
were
possible
in
france
everyone
declared
that
the
republic
was
impossible
in
france
no
matter
remarked
one
gentleman
in
a
loud
tone
people
take
too
much
interest
in
the
revolution
a
heap
of
histories
of
different
kinds
of
works
are
published
concerning
it
without
taking
into
account
said
martinon
that
there
are
probably
subjects
of
far
more
importance
which
might
be
studied
a
gentleman
occupying
a
ministerial
office
laid
the
blame
on
the
scandals
associated
with
the
stage
thus
for
instance
this
new
drama
of
reine
really
goes
beyond
the
proper
limits
what
need
was
there
for
telling
us
about
the
valois
all
this
exhibits
loyalty
in
an
unfavourable
light
is
just
like
your
press
there
is
no
use
in
talking
the
september
laws
are
altogether
too
mild
for
my
part
i
would
like
to
have
to
gag
the
journalists
at
the
slightest
display
of
insolence
drag
them
before
a
council
of
war
and
then
make
an
end
of
the
business
oh
take
care
monsieur
take
care
said
a
professor
do
attack
the
precious
boons
we
gained
in
respect
our
liberties
it
would
be
better
he
contended
to
adopt
a
policy
of
decentralisation
and
to
distribute
the
surplus
populations
of
the
towns
through
the
country
districts
but
they
are
gangrened
exclaimed
a
catholic
let
religion
be
more
firmly
established
martinon
hastened
to
observe
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
a
restraining
force
all
the
evil
lay
in
this
modern
longing
to
rise
above
one
class
and
to
possess
luxuries
however
urged
a
manufacturer
luxury
aids
commerce
therefore
i
approve
of
the
duc
de
nemours
action
in
insisting
on
having
short
breeches
at
his
evening
parties
thiers
came
to
one
of
them
in
a
pair
of
trousers
you
know
his
joke
on
the
subject
yes
charming
but
he
turned
round
to
the
demagogues
and
his
speech
on
the
question
of
incompatibilities
was
not
without
its
influence
in
bringing
about
the
attempt
of
the
twelfth
of
may
oh
pooh
ay
ay
the
circle
had
to
make
a
little
opening
to
give
a
passage
to
a
carrying
a
tray
who
was
trying
to
make
his
way
into
the
under
the
green
shades
of
the
the
tables
were
covered
with
two
rows
of
cards
and
gold
coins
frederick
stopped
beside
one
corner
of
the
table
lost
the
fifteen
napoleons
which
he
had
in
his
pocket
whirled
lightly
about
and
found
himself
on
the
threshold
of
the
boudoir
in
which
madame
dambreuse
happened
to
be
at
that
moment
it
was
filled
with
women
sitting
close
to
one
another
in
little
groups
on
seats
without
backs
their
long
skirts
swelling
round
them
seemed
like
waves
from
which
their
waists
emerged
and
their
breasts
were
clearly
outlined
by
the
slope
of
their
corsages
nearly
every
one
of
them
had
a
bouquet
of
violets
in
her
hand
the
dull
shade
of
their
gloves
showed
off
the
whiteness
of
their
arms
which
formed
a
contrast
with
its
human
flesh
tints
over
the
shoulders
of
some
of
them
hung
fringe
or
and
every
now
and
then
as
they
quivered
with
emotion
it
seemed
as
if
their
bodices
were
about
to
fall
down
but
the
decorum
of
their
countenances
tempered
the
exciting
effect
of
their
costumes
several
of
them
had
a
placidity
almost
like
that
of
animals
and
this
resemblance
to
the
brute
creation
on
the
part
of
women
made
him
think
of
the
interior
of
a
harem
indeed
a
grosser
comparison
suggested
itself
to
the
young
man
mind
every
variety
of
beauty
was
to
be
found
there
some
english
ladies
with
the
profile
familiar
in
keepsakes
an
italian
whose
black
eyes
shot
forth
flashes
like
a
vesuvius
three
sisters
dressed
in
blue
three
normans
fresh
as
april
apples
a
tall
girl
with
a
set
of
amethysts
and
the
bright
scintillation
of
diamonds
which
trembled
in
aigrettes
worn
over
their
hair
the
luminous
spots
of
precious
stones
laid
over
their
breasts
and
the
delightful
radiance
of
pearls
which
adorned
their
foreheads
mingled
with
the
glitter
of
gold
rings
as
well
as
with
the
lace
powder
the
feathers
the
vermilion
of
dainty
mouths
and
the
hue
of
teeth
the
ceiling
rounded
like
a
cupola
gave
to
the
boudoir
the
form
of
a
and
a
current
of
perfumed
air
circulated
under
the
flapping
of
their
fans
frederick
planting
himself
behind
them
put
up
his
eyeglass
and
scanned
their
shoulders
not
all
of
which
did
he
consider
irreproachable
he
thought
about
the
maréchale
and
this
dispelled
the
temptations
that
beset
him
or
consoled
him
for
not
yielding
to
them
he
gazed
however
at
madame
dambreuse
and
he
considered
her
charming
in
spite
of
her
mouth
being
rather
large
and
her
nostrils
too
dilated
but
she
was
remarkably
graceful
in
appearance
there
was
as
it
were
an
expression
of
passionate
languor
in
the
ringlets
of
her
hair
and
her
forehead
which
was
like
agate
seemed
to
cover
a
great
deal
and
indicated
a
masterful
intelligence
she
had
placed
beside
her
her
husband
niece
a
rather
young
person
from
time
to
time
she
left
her
seat
to
receive
those
who
had
just
come
in
and
the
murmur
of
feminine
voices
made
as
it
were
a
cackling
like
that
of
birds
they
were
talking
about
the
tunisian
ambassadors
and
their
costumes
one
lady
had
been
present
at
the
last
reception
of
the
academy
another
referred
to
the
of
molière
which
had
recently
been
performed
at
the
théâtre
français
but
with
a
significant
glance
towards
her
niece
madame
dambreuse
laid
a
finger
on
her
lips
while
the
smile
which
escaped
from
her
contradicted
this
display
of
austerity
suddenly
martinon
appeared
at
the
door
directly
in
front
of
her
she
arose
at
once
he
offered
her
his
arm
frederick
in
order
to
watch
the
progress
of
these
gallantries
on
martinon
part
walked
past
the
and
came
up
with
them
in
the
large
madame
dambreuse
very
soon
quitted
her
cavalier
and
began
chatting
with
frederick
himself
in
a
very
familiar
tone
she
understood
that
he
did
not
play
cards
and
did
not
dance
young
people
have
a
tendency
to
be
melancholy
then
with
a
single
comprehensive
glance
around
besides
this
sort
of
thing
is
not
amusing
at
least
for
certain
natures
and
she
drew
up
in
front
of
the
row
of
armchairs
uttering
a
few
polite
remarks
here
and
there
while
some
old
men
with
double
eyeglasses
came
to
pay
court
to
her
she
introduced
frederick
to
some
of
them
dambreuse
touched
him
lightly
on
the
elbow
and
led
him
out
on
the
terrace
he
had
seen
the
minister
the
thing
was
not
easy
to
manage
before
he
could
be
qualified
for
the
post
of
auditor
to
the
council
of
state
he
should
pass
an
examination
frederick
seized
with
an
unaccountable
replied
that
he
had
a
knowledge
of
the
subjects
prescribed
for
it
the
financier
was
not
surprised
at
this
after
all
the
eulogies
roque
had
pronounced
on
his
abilities
at
the
mention
of
this
name
a
vision
of
little
louise
her
house
and
her
room
passed
through
his
mind
and
he
remembered
how
he
had
on
nights
like
this
stood
at
her
window
listening
to
the
wagoners
driving
past
this
recollection
of
his
griefs
brought
back
the
thought
of
madame
arnoux
and
he
relapsed
into
silence
as
he
continued
to
pace
up
and
down
the
terrace
the
windows
shone
amid
the
darkness
like
slabs
of
flame
the
buzz
of
the
ball
gradually
grew
fainter
the
carriages
were
beginning
to
leave
why
in
the
world
dambreuse
went
on
are
you
so
anxious
to
be
attached
to
the
council
of
state
and
he
declared
in
the
tone
of
a
man
of
broad
views
that
the
public
functions
led
to
nothing
he
could
speak
with
some
authority
on
that
point
business
was
much
better
frederick
urged
as
an
objection
the
difficulty
of
grappling
with
all
the
details
of
business
pooh
i
could
post
you
up
well
in
them
in
a
very
short
time
would
he
like
to
be
a
partner
in
any
of
his
own
undertakings
the
young
man
saw
as
by
a
an
enormous
fortune
coming
into
his
hands
let
us
go
in
again
said
the
banker
you
are
staying
for
supper
with
us
are
you
not
it
was
three
they
left
the
terrace
in
the
a
table
at
which
supper
was
served
up
awaited
the
guests
dambreuse
perceived
martinon
and
drawing
near
his
wife
in
a
low
tone
is
it
you
who
invited
him
she
answered
dryly
yes
of
course
the
niece
was
not
present
the
guests
drank
a
great
deal
of
wine
and
laughed
very
loudly
and
risky
jokes
did
not
give
any
offence
all
present
experiencing
that
sense
of
relief
which
follows
a
somewhat
prolonged
period
of
constraint
martinon
alone
displayed
anything
like
gravity
he
refused
to
drink
champagne
as
he
thought
this
good
form
and
moreover
he
assumed
an
air
of
tact
and
politeness
for
when
dambreuse
who
had
a
contracted
chest
complained
of
an
oppression
he
made
repeated
enquiries
about
that
gentleman
health
and
then
let
his
blue
eyes
wander
in
the
direction
of
madame
dambreuse
she
questioned
frederick
in
order
to
find
out
which
of
the
young
ladies
he
liked
best
he
had
noticed
none
of
them
in
particular
and
besides
he
preferred
the
women
of
thirty
there
perhaps
you
show
your
sense
she
returned
then
as
they
were
putting
on
their
pelisses
and
paletots
dambreuse
said
to
him
come
and
see
me
one
of
these
mornings
and
we
have
a
chat
martinon
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
was
lighting
a
cigar
and
as
he
puffed
it
he
presented
such
a
heavy
profile
that
his
companion
allowed
this
remark
to
escape
from
him
upon
my
word
you
have
a
fine
head
it
has
turned
a
few
other
heads
replied
the
young
magistrate
with
an
air
of
mingled
and
annoyance
as
soon
as
frederick
was
in
bed
he
summed
up
the
main
features
of
the
evening
party
in
the
first
place
his
own
toilet
he
had
looked
at
himself
several
times
in
the
mirrors
from
the
cut
of
his
coat
to
the
knot
of
his
pumps
left
nothing
to
find
fault
with
he
had
spoken
to
influential
men
and
seen
wealthy
ladies
at
close
quarters
dambreuse
had
shown
himself
to
be
an
admirable
type
of
man
and
madame
dambreuse
an
almost
bewitching
type
of
woman
he
weighed
one
by
one
her
slightest
words
her
looks
a
thousand
things
incapable
of
being
analysed
it
would
be
a
right
good
thing
to
have
such
a
mistress
and
after
all
why
should
he
not
he
would
have
as
good
a
chance
with
her
as
any
other
man
perhaps
she
was
not
so
hard
to
win
then
martinon
came
back
to
his
recollection
and
as
he
fell
asleep
he
smiled
with
pity
for
this
worthy
fellow
he
woke
up
with
the
thought
of
the
maréchale
in
his
mind
those
words
of
her
note
after
evening
were
in
fact
an
appointment
for
the
very
same
day
he
waited
until
nine
and
then
hurried
to
her
house
some
one
who
had
been
going
up
the
stairs
before
him
shut
the
door
he
rang
the
bell
delphine
came
out
and
told
him
that
madame
was
not
there
frederick
persisted
begging
of
her
to
admit
him
he
had
something
of
a
very
serious
nature
to
communicate
to
her
only
a
word
would
suffice
at
length
the
argument
proved
successful
and
the
maid
let
him
into
the
anteroom
rosanette
appeared
she
was
in
a
negligée
with
her
hair
loose
and
shaking
her
head
she
waved
her
arms
when
she
was
some
paces
away
from
him
to
indicate
that
she
could
not
receive
him
now
frederick
descended
the
stairs
slowly
this
caprice
was
worse
than
any
of
the
others
she
had
indulged
in
he
could
not
understand
it
at
all
in
front
of
the
porter
lodge
mademoiselle
vatnaz
stopped
him
has
she
received
you
no
you
been
put
out
how
do
you
know
that
is
quite
plain
but
come
on
let
us
go
away
i
am
suffocating
she
made
him
accompany
her
along
the
street
she
panted
for
breath
he
could
feel
her
thin
arm
trembling
on
his
own
suddenly
she
broke
out
ah
the
wretch
who
pray
why
he
he
delmar
this
revelation
humiliated
frederick
he
next
asked
are
you
quite
sure
of
it
why
when
i
tell
you
i
followed
him
exclaimed
the
vatnaz
i
saw
him
going
in
now
do
you
understand
i
ought
to
have
expected
it
for
that
matter
was
i
in
my
stupidity
that
introduced
him
to
her
and
if
you
only
knew
all
my
god
why
i
picked
him
up
supported
him
clothed
him
and
then
all
the
paragraphs
i
got
into
the
newspapers
about
him
i
loved
him
like
a
mother
then
with
a
sneer
ha
monsieur
wants
velvet
robes
you
may
be
sure
is
a
speculation
on
his
part
and
as
for
her
to
think
that
i
knew
her
to
earn
her
living
as
a
seamstress
if
it
were
not
for
me
she
would
have
fallen
into
the
mire
twenty
times
over
but
i
will
plunge
her
into
it
yet
i
see
her
dying
in
a
hospital
and
everything
about
her
will
be
known
and
like
a
torrent
of
dirty
water
from
a
vessel
full
of
refuse
her
rage
poured
out
in
a
tumultuous
fashion
into
frederick
ear
the
recital
of
her
rival
disgraceful
acts
she
lived
with
jumillac
with
flacourt
with
little
allard
with
bertinaux
with
the
fellow
no
was
the
other
they
are
two
brothers
it
makes
no
difference
and
when
she
was
in
difficulties
i
settled
everything
she
is
so
avaricious
and
then
you
will
agree
with
me
was
nice
and
kind
of
me
to
go
to
see
her
for
we
are
not
persons
of
the
same
grade
am
i
a
fast
woman
i
do
i
sell
myself
without
taking
into
account
that
she
is
as
stupid
as
a
head
of
cabbage
she
writes
with
a
after
all
they
are
well
met
they
make
a
precious
couple
though
he
styles
himself
an
artist
and
thinks
himself
a
man
of
genius
but
my
god
if
he
had
only
intelligence
he
would
not
have
done
such
an
infamous
thing
men
do
as
a
rule
leave
a
superior
woman
for
a
hussy
what
do
i
care
about
him
after
all
he
is
becoming
ugly
i
hate
him
if
i
met
him
mind
you
spit
in
his
face
she
spat
out
as
she
uttered
the
words
yes
this
is
what
i
think
about
him
now
and
arnoux
eh
is
it
abominable
he
has
forgiven
her
so
often
you
ca
conceive
the
sacrifices
he
has
made
for
her
she
ought
to
kiss
his
feet
he
is
so
generous
so
good
frederick
was
delighted
at
hearing
delmar
disparaged
he
had
taken
sides
with
arnoux
this
perfidy
on
rosanette
part
seemed
to
him
an
abnormal
and
inexcusable
thing
and
infected
with
this
elderly
emotion
he
felt
a
sort
of
tenderness
towards
her
suddenly
he
found
himself
in
front
of
arnoux
door
mademoiselle
vatnaz
without
his
attention
having
been
drawn
to
it
had
led
him
down
towards
the
rue
poissonnière
here
we
are
said
she
as
for
me
i
ca
go
up
but
you
surely
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
you
from
doing
what
from
telling
him
everything
faith
frederick
as
if
waking
up
with
a
start
saw
the
baseness
towards
which
she
was
urging
him
well
she
said
after
a
pause
he
raised
his
eyes
towards
the
second
floor
madame
arnoux
lamp
was
burning
in
fact
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
him
from
going
up
i
am
going
to
wait
for
you
here
go
on
then
this
direction
had
the
effect
of
chilling
him
and
he
said
i
shall
be
a
long
time
up
there
you
would
do
better
to
return
home
i
will
call
on
you
no
no
replied
the
vatnaz
stamping
with
her
foot
take
him
with
you
bring
him
there
let
him
catch
them
together
but
delmar
will
no
longer
be
there
she
hung
down
her
head
yes
that
true
perhaps
and
she
remained
without
speaking
in
the
middle
of
the
street
with
vehicles
all
around
her
then
fixing
on
him
her
eyes
i
may
rely
on
you
may
i
not
there
is
now
a
sacred
bond
between
us
do
what
you
say
then
we
talk
about
it
frederick
in
passing
through
the
lobby
heard
two
voices
responding
to
one
another
madame
arnoux
voice
was
saying
do
lie
do
lie
pray
he
went
in
the
voices
suddenly
ceased
arnoux
was
walking
from
one
end
of
the
apartment
to
the
other
and
madame
was
seated
on
the
little
chair
near
the
fire
extremely
pale
and
staring
straight
before
her
frederick
stepped
back
and
was
about
to
retire
when
arnoux
grasped
his
hand
glad
that
some
one
had
come
to
his
rescue
but
i
am
afraid
said
frederick
stay
here
i
beg
of
you
he
whispered
in
his
ear
madame
remarked
you
must
make
some
allowance
for
this
scene
monsieur
moreau
such
things
sometimes
unfortunately
occur
in
households
they
do
when
we
introduce
them
there
ourselves
said
arnoux
in
a
jolly
tone
women
have
crotchets
i
assure
you
this
for
instance
is
not
a
bad
one
see
no
quite
the
contrary
well
she
has
been
amusing
herself
for
the
last
hour
by
teasing
me
with
a
heap
of
idle
stories
they
are
true
retorted
madame
arnoux
losing
patience
for
in
fact
you
bought
it
yourself
i
yes
you
yourself
at
the
persian
house
the
cashmere
thought
frederick
he
was
filled
with
a
consciousness
of
guilt
and
got
quite
alarmed
she
quickly
added
it
was
on
saturday
the
fourteenth
the
fourteenth
said
arnoux
looking
up
as
if
he
were
searching
in
his
mind
for
a
date
and
furthermore
the
clerk
who
sold
it
to
you
was
a
young
man
how
could
i
remember
what
sort
of
man
the
clerk
was
and
yet
it
was
at
your
dictation
he
wrote
the
address
rue
de
laval
how
do
you
know
said
arnoux
in
amazement
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
oh
is
very
simple
i
went
to
get
my
cashmere
altered
and
the
superintendent
of
the
millinery
department
told
me
that
they
had
just
sent
another
of
the
same
sort
to
madame
arnoux
is
it
my
fault
if
there
is
a
madame
arnoux
in
the
same
street
yes
but
not
jacques
arnoux
she
returned
thereupon
he
began
to
talk
in
an
incoherent
fashion
protesting
that
he
was
innocent
it
was
some
misapprehension
some
accident
one
of
those
things
that
happen
in
some
way
that
is
utterly
unaccountable
men
should
not
be
condemned
on
mere
suspicion
vague
probabilities
and
he
referred
to
the
case
of
the
unfortunate
lesurques
in
short
i
say
you
are
mistaken
do
you
want
me
to
take
my
oath
on
it
is
not
worth
while
why
she
looked
him
straight
in
the
face
without
saying
a
word
then
stretched
out
her
hand
took
down
the
little
silver
chest
from
the
mantelpiece
and
handed
him
a
bill
which
was
spread
open
arnoux
coloured
up
to
his
ears
and
his
swollen
and
distorted
features
betrayed
his
confusion
but
he
said
in
faltering
tones
what
does
this
prove
ah
she
said
with
a
peculiar
ring
in
her
voice
in
which
sorrow
and
irony
were
blended
ah
arnoux
held
the
bill
in
his
hands
and
turned
it
round
without
removing
his
eyes
from
it
as
if
he
were
going
to
find
in
it
the
solution
of
a
great
problem
ah
yes
yes
i
remember
said
he
at
length
was
a
commission
you
ought
to
know
about
that
matter
frederick
frederick
remained
silent
a
commission
that
père
oudry
entrusted
to
me
and
for
whom
for
his
mistress
for
your
own
exclaimed
madame
arnoux
springing
to
her
feet
and
standing
erect
before
him
i
swear
to
you
do
begin
over
again
i
know
everything
ha
quite
right
so
you
spying
on
me
she
returned
coldly
perhaps
that
wounds
your
delicacy
since
you
are
in
a
passion
said
arnoux
looking
for
his
hat
and
ca
be
reasoned
with
then
with
a
big
sigh
do
marry
my
poor
friend
do
if
you
take
my
advice
and
he
took
himself
off
finding
it
absolutely
necessary
to
get
into
the
open
air
then
there
was
a
deep
silence
and
it
seemed
as
if
everything
in
the
room
had
become
more
motionless
than
before
a
luminous
circle
above
the
lamp
whitened
the
ceiling
while
at
the
corners
stretched
out
bits
of
shade
resembling
pieces
of
black
gauze
placed
on
top
of
one
another
the
ticking
of
the
clock
and
the
crackling
of
the
fire
were
the
only
sounds
that
disturbed
the
stillness
madame
arnoux
had
just
seated
herself
in
the
armchair
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
she
bit
her
lip
and
shivered
she
drew
her
hands
up
to
her
face
a
sob
broke
from
her
and
she
began
to
weep
he
sat
down
on
the
little
couch
and
in
the
soothing
tone
in
which
one
addresses
a
sick
person
you
do
suspect
me
of
having
anything
to
do
with
she
made
no
reply
but
continuing
presently
to
give
utterance
to
her
own
thoughts
i
leave
him
perfectly
free
there
was
no
necessity
for
lying
on
his
part
that
is
quite
true
said
frederick
no
doubt
he
added
it
was
the
result
of
arnoux
habits
he
had
acted
thoughtlessly
but
perhaps
in
matters
of
a
graver
character
what
do
you
see
then
that
can
be
graver
oh
nothing
frederick
bent
his
head
with
a
smile
of
acquiescence
nevertheless
he
urged
arnoux
possessed
certain
good
qualities
he
was
fond
of
his
children
ay
and
he
does
all
he
can
to
ruin
them
frederick
urged
that
this
was
due
to
an
excessively
disposition
for
indeed
he
was
a
good
fellow
she
exclaimed
but
what
is
the
meaning
of
that
a
good
fellow
and
he
proceeded
to
defend
arnoux
in
the
vaguest
kind
of
language
he
could
think
of
and
while
expressing
his
sympathy
with
her
he
rejoiced
he
was
delighted
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
through
retaliation
or
need
of
affection
she
would
fly
to
him
for
refuge
his
love
was
intensified
by
the
hope
which
had
now
grown
immeasurably
stronger
in
his
breast
never
had
she
appeared
to
him
so
captivating
so
perfectly
beautiful
from
time
to
time
a
deep
breath
made
her
bosom
swell
her
two
eyes
gazing
fixedly
into
space
seemed
dilated
by
a
vision
in
the
depths
of
her
consciousness
and
her
lips
were
slightly
parted
as
if
to
let
her
soul
escape
through
them
sometimes
she
pressed
her
handkerchief
over
them
tightly
he
would
have
liked
to
be
this
dainty
little
piece
of
cambric
moistened
with
her
tears
in
spite
of
himself
he
cast
a
look
at
the
bed
at
the
end
of
the
alcove
picturing
to
himself
her
head
lying
on
the
pillow
and
so
vividly
did
this
present
itself
to
his
imagination
that
he
had
to
restrain
himself
to
keep
from
clasping
her
in
his
arms
she
closed
her
eyelids
and
now
she
appeared
quiescent
and
languid
then
he
drew
closer
to
her
and
bending
over
her
he
eagerly
scanned
her
face
at
that
moment
he
heard
the
noise
of
boots
in
the
lobby
outside
it
was
the
other
they
heard
him
shutting
the
door
of
his
own
room
frederick
made
a
sign
to
madame
arnoux
to
ascertain
from
her
whether
he
ought
to
go
there
she
replied
yes
in
the
same
voiceless
fashion
and
this
mute
exchange
of
thoughts
between
them
was
as
it
were
an
assent
the
preliminary
step
in
adultery
arnoux
was
just
taking
off
his
coat
to
go
to
bed
well
how
is
she
going
on
oh
better
said
frederick
this
will
pass
off
but
arnoux
was
in
an
anxious
state
of
mind
you
do
know
her
she
has
got
hysterical
now
idiot
of
a
clerk
this
is
what
comes
of
being
too
good
if
i
had
not
given
that
cursed
shawl
to
rosanette
do
regret
having
done
so
a
bit
nobody
could
be
more
grateful
to
you
than
she
is
do
you
really
think
so
frederick
had
not
a
doubt
of
it
the
best
proof
of
it
was
her
dismissal
of
père
oudry
ah
poor
little
thing
and
in
the
excess
of
his
emotion
arnoux
wanted
to
rush
off
to
her
forthwith
is
worth
while
i
am
calling
to
see
her
she
is
unwell
all
the
more
reason
for
my
going
he
quickly
put
on
his
coat
again
and
took
up
his
candlestick
frederick
cursed
his
own
stupidity
and
pointed
out
to
him
that
for
decency
sake
he
ought
to
remain
this
night
with
his
wife
he
could
not
leave
her
it
would
be
very
nasty
i
tell
you
candidly
you
would
be
doing
wrong
there
is
no
hurry
over
there
you
will
go
come
do
this
for
my
sake
arnoux
put
down
his
candlestick
and
embracing
him
said
you
are
a
right
good
fellow
chapter
ix
the
friend
of
the
family
then
began
for
frederick
an
existence
of
misery
he
became
the
parasite
of
the
house
if
anyone
were
indisposed
he
called
three
times
a
day
to
know
how
the
patient
was
went
to
the
contrived
to
do
a
thousand
acts
of
kindness
and
he
endured
with
an
air
of
contentment
mademoiselle
marthe
poutings
and
the
caresses
of
little
eugène
who
was
always
drawing
his
dirty
hands
over
the
young
man
face
he
was
present
at
dinners
at
which
monsieur
and
madame
facing
each
other
did
not
exchange
a
word
unless
it
happened
that
arnoux
provoked
his
wife
with
the
absurd
remarks
he
made
when
the
meal
was
over
he
would
play
about
the
room
with
his
son
conceal
himself
behind
the
furniture
or
carry
the
little
boy
on
his
back
walking
about
on
all
fours
like
the
bearnais
at
last
he
would
go
out
and
she
would
at
once
plunge
into
the
eternal
subject
of
complaint
arnoux
footnote
henry
translator
it
was
not
his
misconduct
that
excited
her
indignation
but
her
pride
appeared
to
be
wounded
and
she
did
not
hide
her
repugnance
towards
this
man
who
showed
an
absence
of
delicacy
dignity
and
honour
or
rather
he
is
mad
she
said
frederick
artfully
appealed
to
her
to
confide
in
him
ere
long
he
knew
all
the
details
of
her
life
her
parents
were
people
in
a
humble
rank
in
life
at
chartres
one
day
arnoux
while
sketching
on
the
bank
of
the
river
at
this
period
he
believed
himself
to
be
a
painter
saw
her
leaving
the
church
and
made
her
an
offer
of
marriage
on
account
of
his
wealth
he
was
unhesitatingly
accepted
besides
he
was
desperately
in
love
with
her
she
added
good
heavens
he
loves
me
still
after
his
fashion
they
spent
the
few
months
immediately
after
their
marriage
in
travelling
through
italy
arnoux
in
spite
of
his
enthusiasm
at
the
sight
of
the
scenery
and
the
masterpieces
did
nothing
but
groan
over
the
wine
and
to
find
some
kind
of
amusement
organised
picnics
along
with
some
english
people
the
profit
which
he
had
made
by
reselling
some
pictures
tempted
him
to
take
up
the
fine
arts
as
a
commercial
speculation
then
he
became
infatuated
about
pottery
just
now
other
branches
of
commerce
attracted
him
and
as
he
had
become
more
and
more
vulgarised
he
contracted
coarse
and
extravagant
habits
it
was
not
so
much
for
his
vices
she
had
to
reproach
him
as
for
his
entire
conduct
no
change
could
be
expected
in
him
and
her
unhappiness
was
irreparable
frederick
declared
that
his
own
life
in
the
same
way
was
a
failure
he
was
still
a
young
man
however
why
should
he
despair
and
she
gave
him
good
advice
work
and
marry
he
answered
her
with
bitter
smiles
for
in
place
of
giving
utterance
to
the
real
cause
of
his
grief
he
pretended
that
it
was
of
a
different
character
a
sublime
feeling
and
he
assumed
the
part
of
an
antony
to
some
extent
the
man
accursed
by
fate
language
which
did
not
however
change
very
materially
the
complexion
of
his
thoughts
for
certain
men
action
becomes
more
difficult
as
desire
becomes
stronger
they
are
embarrassed
by
and
terrified
by
the
fear
of
making
themselves
disliked
besides
deep
attachments
resemble
virtuous
women
they
are
afraid
of
being
discovered
and
pass
through
life
with
downcast
eyes
though
he
was
now
better
acquainted
with
madame
arnoux
for
that
very
reason
perhaps
he
was
still
more
than
before
each
morning
he
swore
in
his
own
mind
that
he
would
take
a
bold
course
he
was
prevented
from
doing
so
by
an
unconquerable
feeling
of
bashfulness
and
he
had
no
example
to
guide
him
inasmuch
as
she
was
different
from
other
women
from
the
force
of
his
dreams
he
had
placed
her
outside
the
ordinary
pale
of
humanity
at
her
side
he
felt
himself
of
less
importance
in
the
world
than
the
sprigs
of
silk
that
escaped
from
her
scissors
then
he
thought
of
some
monstrous
and
absurd
devices
such
as
surprises
at
night
with
narcotics
and
false
keys
anything
appearing
easier
to
him
than
to
face
her
disdain
besides
the
children
the
two
and
the
relative
position
of
the
rooms
caused
insurmountable
obstacles
so
then
he
made
up
his
mind
to
possess
her
himself
alone
and
to
bring
her
to
live
with
him
far
away
in
the
depths
of
some
solitude
he
even
asked
himself
what
lake
would
be
blue
enough
what
seashore
would
be
delightful
enough
for
her
whether
it
would
be
in
spain
switzerland
or
the
east
and
expressly
fixing
on
days
when
she
seemed
more
irritated
than
usual
he
told
her
that
it
would
be
necessary
for
her
to
leave
the
house
to
find
out
some
ground
to
justify
such
a
step
and
that
he
saw
no
way
out
of
it
but
a
separation
however
for
the
sake
of
the
children
whom
she
loved
she
would
never
resort
to
such
an
extreme
course
so
much
virtue
served
to
increase
his
respect
for
her
he
spent
each
afternoon
in
recalling
the
visit
he
had
paid
the
night
before
and
in
longing
for
the
evening
to
come
in
order
that
he
might
call
again
when
he
did
not
dine
with
them
he
posted
himself
about
nine
at
the
corner
of
the
street
and
as
soon
as
arnoux
had
slammed
the
behind
him
frederick
quickly
ascended
the
two
flights
of
stairs
and
asked
the
in
an
ingenuous
fashion
is
monsieur
in
then
he
would
exhibit
surprise
at
finding
that
arnoux
was
gone
out
the
latter
frequently
came
back
unexpectedly
then
frederick
had
to
accompany
him
to
the
little
café
in
the
rue
which
regimbart
now
frequented
the
citizen
began
by
giving
vent
to
some
fresh
grievance
which
he
had
against
the
crown
then
they
would
chat
pouring
out
friendly
abuse
on
one
another
for
the
earthenware
manufacturer
took
regimbart
for
a
thinker
of
a
high
order
and
vexed
at
seeing
him
neglecting
so
many
chances
of
winning
distinction
teased
the
citizen
about
his
laziness
it
seemed
to
regimbart
that
arnoux
was
a
man
full
of
heart
and
imagination
but
decidedly
of
lax
morals
and
therefore
he
was
quite
unceremonious
towards
a
personage
he
respected
so
little
refusing
even
to
dine
at
his
house
on
the
ground
that
such
formality
was
a
bore
sometimes
at
the
moment
of
parting
arnoux
would
be
seized
with
hunger
he
found
it
necessary
to
order
an
omelet
or
some
roasted
apples
and
as
there
was
never
anything
to
eat
in
the
establishment
he
sent
out
for
something
they
waited
regimbart
did
not
leave
and
ended
by
consenting
in
a
grumbling
fashion
to
have
something
himself
he
was
nevertheless
gloomy
for
he
remained
for
hours
seated
before
a
glass
as
providence
did
not
regulate
things
in
harmony
with
his
ideas
he
was
becoming
a
hypochondriac
no
longer
cared
even
to
read
the
newspapers
and
at
the
mere
mention
of
england
name
began
to
bellow
with
rage
on
one
occasion
referring
to
a
waiter
who
attended
on
him
carelessly
he
exclaimed
have
we
not
enough
of
insults
from
the
foreigner
except
at
these
critical
periods
he
remained
taciturn
contemplating
an
infallible
stroke
of
business
that
would
burst
up
the
whole
shop
whilst
he
was
lost
in
these
reflections
arnoux
in
a
monotonous
voice
and
with
a
slight
look
of
intoxication
related
incredible
anecdotes
in
which
he
always
shone
himself
owing
to
his
assurance
and
frederick
this
was
no
doubt
due
to
some
resemblances
felt
more
or
less
attracted
towards
him
he
reproached
himself
for
this
weakness
believing
that
on
the
contrary
he
ought
to
hate
this
man
arnoux
in
frederick
presence
complained
of
his
wife
her
obstinacy
her
unjust
accusations
she
had
not
been
like
this
in
former
days
if
i
were
you
said
frederick
i
would
make
her
an
allowance
and
live
alone
arnoux
made
no
reply
and
the
next
moment
he
began
to
sound
her
praises
she
was
good
devoted
intelligent
and
virtuous
and
passing
to
her
personal
beauty
he
made
some
revelations
on
the
subject
with
the
thoughtlessness
of
people
who
display
their
treasures
at
taverns
his
equilibrium
was
disturbed
by
a
catastrophe
he
had
been
appointed
one
of
the
board
of
superintendence
in
a
kaolin
company
but
placing
reliance
on
everything
that
he
was
told
he
had
signed
inaccurate
reports
and
approved
without
verification
of
the
annual
inventories
fraudulently
prepared
by
the
manager
the
company
had
now
failed
and
arnoux
being
legally
responsible
was
along
with
the
others
who
were
liable
under
the
guaranty
condemned
to
pay
damages
which
meant
a
loss
to
him
of
thirty
thousand
francs
not
to
speak
of
the
costs
of
the
judgment
frederick
read
the
report
of
the
case
in
a
newspaper
and
at
once
hurried
off
to
the
rue
de
paradis
he
was
ushered
into
madame
apartment
it
was
a
round
table
close
to
the
fire
was
covered
with
bowls
of
au
slippers
trailed
over
the
carpet
and
clothes
over
the
armchairs
arnoux
was
attired
in
trousers
and
a
knitted
vest
with
his
eyes
bloodshot
and
his
hair
in
disorder
little
eugène
was
crying
at
the
pain
caused
by
an
attack
of
mumps
while
nibbling
at
a
slice
of
bread
and
butter
his
sister
was
eating
quietly
madame
arnoux
a
little
paler
than
usual
was
attending
on
all
three
of
them
well
said
arnoux
heaving
a
deep
sigh
you
know
all
about
it
and
as
frederick
gave
him
a
pitying
look
there
you
see
i
have
been
the
victim
of
my
own
trustfulness
then
he
relapsed
into
silence
and
so
great
was
his
prostration
that
he
pushed
his
breakfast
away
from
him
madame
arnoux
raised
her
eyes
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
he
passed
his
hand
across
his
forehead
after
all
i
am
not
guilty
i
have
nothing
to
reproach
myself
with
is
a
misfortune
it
will
be
got
over
ay
and
so
much
the
worse
faith
he
took
a
bite
of
a
cake
however
in
obedience
to
his
entreaties
that
evening
he
wished
that
she
should
go
and
dine
with
him
alone
in
a
private
room
at
the
maison
madame
arnoux
did
not
at
all
understand
this
emotional
impulse
taking
offence
in
fact
at
being
treated
as
if
she
were
a
light
woman
arnoux
on
the
contrary
meant
it
as
a
proof
of
affection
then
as
he
was
beginning
to
feel
dull
he
went
to
pay
the
maréchale
a
visit
in
order
to
amuse
himself
up
to
the
present
he
had
been
pardoned
for
many
things
owing
to
his
reputation
for
his
lawsuit
placed
him
amongst
men
of
bad
character
no
one
visited
his
house
frederick
however
considered
that
he
was
bound
in
honour
to
go
there
more
frequently
than
ever
he
hired
a
box
at
the
italian
opera
and
brought
them
there
with
him
every
week
meanwhile
the
pair
had
reached
that
period
in
unsuitable
unions
when
an
invincible
lassitude
springs
from
concessions
which
people
get
into
the
habit
of
making
and
which
render
existence
intolerable
madame
arnoux
restrained
her
feelings
from
breaking
out
arnoux
became
gloomy
and
frederick
grew
sad
at
witnessing
the
unhappiness
of
these
two
beings
she
had
imposed
on
him
the
obligation
since
she
had
given
him
her
confidence
of
making
enquiries
as
to
the
state
of
her
affairs
but
shame
prevented
him
from
doing
so
it
was
painful
to
him
to
reflect
that
he
coveted
the
wife
of
this
man
at
whose
he
constantly
sat
nevertheless
he
continued
his
visits
excusing
himself
on
the
ground
that
he
was
bound
to
protect
her
and
that
an
occasion
might
present
itself
for
being
of
service
to
her
eight
days
after
the
ball
he
had
paid
a
visit
to
dambreuse
the
financier
had
offered
him
twenty
shares
in
a
speculation
frederick
did
not
go
back
there
again
deslauriers
had
written
letters
to
him
which
he
left
unanswered
pellerin
had
invited
him
to
go
and
see
the
portrait
he
always
put
it
off
he
gave
way
however
to
persistent
appeals
to
be
introduced
to
rosanette
she
received
him
very
nicely
but
without
springing
on
his
neck
as
she
used
to
do
formerly
his
comrade
was
delighted
at
being
received
by
a
woman
of
easy
virtue
and
above
all
at
having
a
chat
with
an
actor
delmar
was
there
when
he
called
a
drama
in
which
he
appeared
as
a
peasant
lecturing
louis
xiv
and
prophesying
the
events
of
had
made
him
so
conspicuous
that
the
same
part
was
continually
assigned
to
him
and
now
his
function
consisted
of
attacks
on
the
monarchs
of
all
nations
as
an
english
brewer
he
inveighed
against
charles
as
a
student
at
salamanca
he
cursed
philip
ii
or
as
a
sensitive
father
he
expressed
indignation
against
the
pompadour
this
was
the
most
beautiful
bit
of
acting
the
brats
of
the
street
used
to
wait
at
the
door
leading
to
the
in
order
to
see
him
and
his
biography
sold
between
the
acts
described
him
as
taking
care
of
his
aged
mother
reading
the
bible
assisting
the
poor
in
fact
under
the
aspect
of
a
saint
vincent
de
paul
together
with
a
dash
of
brutus
and
mirabeau
people
spoke
of
him
as
our
delmar
he
had
a
mission
he
became
another
christ
all
this
had
fascinated
rosanette
and
she
had
got
rid
of
père
oudry
without
caring
one
jot
about
consequences
as
she
was
not
of
a
covetous
disposition
arnoux
who
knew
her
had
taken
advantage
of
the
state
of
affairs
for
some
time
past
to
spend
very
little
money
on
her
roque
had
appeared
on
the
scene
and
all
three
of
them
carefully
avoided
anything
like
a
candid
explanation
then
fancying
that
she
had
got
rid
of
the
other
solely
on
his
account
arnoux
increased
her
allowance
for
she
was
living
at
a
very
expensive
rate
she
had
even
sold
her
cashmere
in
her
anxiety
to
pay
off
her
old
debts
as
she
said
and
he
was
continually
giving
her
money
while
she
bewitched
him
and
imposed
upon
him
pitilessly
therefore
bills
and
stamped
paper
rained
all
over
the
house
frederick
felt
that
a
crisis
was
approaching
one
day
he
called
to
see
madame
arnoux
she
had
gone
out
monsieur
was
at
work
below
stairs
in
the
shop
in
fact
arnoux
in
the
midst
of
his
japanese
vases
was
trying
to
take
in
a
pair
who
happened
to
be
people
from
the
provinces
he
talked
about
and
about
spotted
porcelain
and
glazed
porcelain
the
others
not
wishing
to
appear
utterly
ignorant
of
the
subject
listened
with
nods
of
approbation
and
made
purchases
when
the
customers
had
gone
out
he
told
frederick
that
he
had
that
very
morning
been
engaged
in
a
little
altercation
with
his
wife
in
order
to
obviate
any
remarks
about
expense
he
had
declared
that
the
maréchale
was
no
longer
his
mistress
i
even
told
her
that
she
was
yours
frederick
was
annoyed
at
this
but
to
utter
reproaches
might
only
betray
him
he
faltered
ah
you
were
in
the
wrong
greatly
in
the
wrong
what
does
that
signify
said
arnoux
where
is
the
disgrace
of
passing
for
her
lover
i
am
really
so
myself
would
you
not
be
flattered
at
being
in
that
position
had
she
spoken
was
this
a
hint
frederick
hastened
to
reply
no
not
at
all
on
the
contrary
well
what
then
yes
is
true
it
makes
no
difference
so
far
as
that
concerned
arnoux
next
asked
and
why
do
you
call
there
oftener
frederick
promised
that
he
would
make
it
his
business
to
go
there
again
ah
i
forgot
you
ought
when
talking
about
rosanette
to
let
out
in
some
way
to
my
wife
that
you
are
her
lover
i
ca
suggest
how
you
can
best
do
it
but
you
find
out
that
i
ask
this
of
you
as
a
special
favour
eh
the
young
man
only
answer
was
an
equivocal
grimace
this
calumny
had
undone
him
he
even
called
on
her
that
evening
and
swore
that
accusation
was
false
is
that
really
so
he
appeared
to
be
speaking
sincerely
and
when
she
had
taken
a
long
breath
of
relief
she
said
to
him
i
believe
you
with
a
beautiful
smile
then
she
hung
down
her
head
and
without
looking
at
him
besides
nobody
has
any
claim
on
you
so
then
she
had
divined
nothing
and
she
despised
him
seeing
that
she
did
not
think
he
could
love
her
well
enough
to
remain
faithful
to
her
frederick
forgetting
his
overtures
while
with
the
other
looked
on
the
permission
accorded
to
him
as
an
insult
to
himself
after
this
she
suggested
that
he
ought
now
and
then
to
pay
rosanette
a
visit
to
get
a
little
glimpse
of
what
she
was
like
arnoux
presently
made
his
appearance
and
five
minutes
later
wished
to
carry
him
off
to
rosanette
abode
the
situation
was
becoming
intolerable
his
attention
was
diverted
by
a
letter
from
a
notary
who
was
going
to
send
him
fifteen
thousand
francs
the
following
day
and
in
order
to
make
up
for
his
neglect
of
deslauriers
he
went
forthwith
to
tell
him
this
good
news
the
advocate
was
lodging
in
the
rue
des
on
the
fifth
floor
over
a
courtyard
his
study
a
little
tiled
apartment
chilly
and
with
a
grey
paper
on
the
walls
had
as
its
principal
decoration
a
gold
medal
the
prize
awarded
him
on
the
occasion
of
taking
out
his
degree
as
a
doctor
of
laws
which
was
fixed
in
an
ebony
frame
near
the
mirror
a
mahogany
bookcase
enclosed
under
its
glass
front
a
hundred
volumes
more
or
less
the
covered
with
occupied
the
centre
of
the
apartment
four
old
armchairs
upholstered
in
green
velvet
were
placed
in
the
corners
and
a
heap
of
shavings
made
a
blaze
in
the
fireplace
where
there
was
always
a
bundle
of
sticks
ready
to
be
lighted
as
soon
as
he
rang
the
bell
it
was
his
and
the
advocate
had
on
a
white
cravat
the
announcement
as
to
the
fifteen
thousand
francs
he
had
no
doubt
given
up
all
hope
of
getting
the
amount
made
him
chuckle
with
delight
that
right
old
fellow
that
right
that
quite
right
he
threw
some
wood
into
the
fire
sat
down
again
and
immediately
began
talking
about
the
journal
the
first
thing
to
do
was
to
get
rid
of
hussonnet
i
quite
tired
of
that
idiot
as
for
officially
professing
opinions
my
own
notion
is
that
the
most
equitable
and
forcible
position
is
to
have
no
opinions
at
all
frederick
appeared
astonished
why
the
thing
is
perfectly
plain
it
is
time
that
politics
should
be
dealt
with
scientifically
the
old
men
of
the
eighteenth
century
began
it
when
rousseau
and
the
men
of
letters
introduced
into
the
political
sphere
philanthropy
poetry
and
other
fudge
to
the
great
delight
of
the
catholics
a
natural
alliance
however
since
the
modern
reformers
i
can
prove
it
all
believe
in
revelation
but
if
you
sing
high
masses
for
poland
if
in
place
of
the
god
of
the
dominicans
who
was
an
executioner
you
take
the
god
of
the
romanticists
who
is
an
upholsterer
if
in
fact
you
have
not
a
wider
conception
of
the
absolute
than
your
ancestors
monarchy
will
penetrate
underneath
your
republican
forms
and
your
red
cap
will
never
be
more
than
the
headpiece
of
a
priest
the
only
difference
will
be
that
the
cell
system
will
take
the
place
of
torture
the
outrageous
treatment
of
religion
that
of
sacrilege
and
the
european
concert
that
of
the
holy
alliance
and
in
this
beautiful
order
which
we
admire
composed
of
the
wreckage
of
the
followers
of
louis
the
last
remains
of
the
voltaireans
with
some
imperial
on
top
and
some
fragments
of
the
british
constitution
you
will
see
the
municipal
councils
trying
to
give
annoyance
to
the
mayor
the
general
councils
to
their
prefect
the
chambers
to
the
king
the
press
to
power
and
the
administration
to
everybody
but
people
get
enraptured
about
the
civil
code
a
work
fabricated
let
them
say
what
they
like
in
a
mean
and
tyrannical
spirit
for
the
legislator
in
place
of
doing
his
duty
to
the
state
which
simply
means
to
observe
customs
in
a
regular
fashion
claims
to
model
society
like
another
lycurgus
why
does
the
law
impede
fathers
of
families
with
regard
to
the
making
of
wills
why
does
it
place
shackles
on
the
compulsory
sale
of
real
estate
why
does
it
punish
as
a
misdemeanour
vagrancy
which
ought
not
even
to
be
regarded
as
a
technical
contravention
of
the
code
and
there
are
other
things
i
know
all
about
them
and
so
i
am
going
to
write
a
little
novel
entitled
history
of
the
idea
of
justice
which
will
be
amusing
but
i
am
infernally
thirsty
and
you
he
leaned
out
through
the
window
and
called
to
the
porter
to
go
and
fetch
them
two
glasses
of
grog
from
the
over
the
way
to
sum
up
i
see
three
parties
no
three
groups
in
none
of
which
do
i
take
the
slightest
interest
those
who
have
those
who
have
nothing
and
those
who
are
trying
to
have
but
all
agree
in
their
idiotic
worship
of
authority
for
example
mably
recommends
that
the
philosophers
should
be
prevented
from
publishing
their
doctrines
wronsky
the
geometrician
describes
the
censorship
as
the
expression
of
speculative
spontaneity
père
enfantin
gives
his
blessing
to
the
hapsburgs
for
having
passed
a
hand
across
the
alps
in
order
to
keep
italy
down
pierre
leroux
wishes
people
to
be
compelled
to
listen
to
an
orator
and
louis
blanc
inclines
towards
a
state
religion
so
much
rage
for
government
have
these
vassals
whom
we
call
the
people
nevertheless
there
is
not
a
single
legitimate
government
in
spite
of
their
sempiternal
principles
but
signifies
it
is
always
necessary
to
go
back
to
a
revolution
to
an
act
of
violence
to
a
transitory
fact
thus
our
principle
is
the
national
sovereignty
embodied
in
the
parliamentary
form
though
the
parliament
does
not
assent
to
this
but
in
what
way
could
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
be
more
sacred
than
the
divine
right
they
are
both
fictions
enough
of
metaphysics
no
more
phantoms
there
is
no
need
of
dogmas
in
order
to
get
the
streets
swept
it
will
be
said
that
i
am
turning
society
upside
down
well
after
all
where
would
be
the
harm
of
that
it
is
indeed
a
nice
thing
this
society
of
yours
frederick
could
have
given
many
answers
but
seeing
that
his
theories
were
far
less
advanced
than
those
of
sénécal
he
was
full
of
indulgence
towards
deslauriers
he
contented
himself
with
arguing
that
such
a
system
would
make
them
generally
hated
on
the
contrary
as
we
should
have
given
to
each
party
a
pledge
of
hatred
against
his
neighbour
all
will
reckon
on
us
you
are
about
to
enter
into
it
yourself
and
to
furnish
us
with
some
transcendent
criticism
it
was
necessary
to
attack
accepted
ideas
the
academy
the
normal
school
the
consérvatoire
the
comédie
française
everything
that
resembled
an
institution
it
was
in
that
way
that
they
would
give
uniformity
to
the
doctrines
taught
in
their
review
then
as
soon
as
it
had
been
thoroughly
the
journal
would
suddenly
be
converted
into
a
daily
publication
thereupon
they
could
find
fault
with
individuals
and
they
will
respect
us
you
may
be
sure
deslauriers
touched
upon
that
old
dream
of
his
the
position
of
so
that
he
might
have
the
unutterable
happiness
of
directing
others
of
entirely
cutting
down
their
articles
of
ordering
them
to
be
written
or
declining
them
his
eyes
twinkled
under
his
goggles
he
got
into
a
state
of
excitement
and
drank
a
few
glasses
of
brandy
one
after
the
other
in
an
automatic
fashion
you
have
to
stand
me
a
dinner
once
a
week
that
indispensable
even
though
you
should
have
to
squander
half
your
income
on
it
people
would
feel
pleasure
in
going
to
it
it
would
be
a
centre
for
the
others
a
lever
for
yourself
and
by
manipulating
public
opinion
at
its
two
ends
literature
and
politics
you
will
see
how
before
six
months
have
passed
we
shall
occupy
the
first
rank
in
paris
frederick
as
he
listened
to
deslauriers
experienced
a
sensation
of
rejuvenescence
like
a
man
who
after
having
been
confined
in
a
room
for
a
long
time
is
suddenly
transported
into
the
open
air
the
enthusiasm
of
his
friend
had
a
contagious
effect
upon
him
yes
i
have
been
an
idler
an
imbecile
you
are
right
all
in
good
time
said
deslauriers
i
have
found
my
frederick
again
and
holding
up
his
jaw
with
closed
fingers
ah
you
have
made
me
suffer
never
mind
i
am
fond
of
you
all
the
same
they
stood
there
gazing
into
each
other
faces
both
deeply
affected
and
were
on
the
point
of
embracing
each
other
a
woman
cap
appeared
on
the
threshold
of
the
anteroom
what
brings
you
here
said
deslauriers
it
was
mademoiselle
clémence
his
mistress
she
replied
that
as
she
happened
to
be
passing
she
could
not
resist
the
desire
to
go
in
to
see
him
and
in
order
that
they
might
have
a
little
repast
together
she
had
brought
some
cakes
which
she
laid
on
the
table
take
care
of
my
papers
said
the
advocate
sharply
besides
this
is
the
third
time
that
i
have
forbidden
you
to
come
at
my
she
wished
to
embrace
him
all
right
go
away
cut
your
stick
he
repelled
her
she
heaved
a
great
sigh
ah
you
are
plaguing
me
again
is
because
i
love
you
i
do
ask
you
to
love
me
but
to
oblige
me
this
harsh
remark
stopped
clémence
tears
she
took
up
her
station
before
the
window
and
remained
there
motionless
with
her
forehead
against
the
pane
her
attitude
and
her
silence
had
an
irritating
effect
on
deslauriers
when
you
have
finished
you
will
order
your
carriage
will
you
not
she
turned
round
with
a
start
you
are
sending
me
away
exactly
she
fixed
on
him
her
large
blue
eyes
no
doubt
as
a
last
appeal
then
drew
the
two
ends
of
her
tartan
across
each
other
lingered
for
a
minute
or
two
and
went
away
you
ought
to
call
her
back
said
frederick
come
now
and
as
he
wished
to
go
out
deslauriers
went
into
the
kitchen
which
also
served
as
his
on
the
stone
floor
beside
a
pair
of
boots
were
to
be
seen
the
remains
of
a
meagre
breakfast
and
a
mattress
with
a
coverlid
was
rolled
up
on
the
floor
in
a
corner
this
will
show
you
said
he
that
i
receive
few
marchionesses
is
easy
to
get
enough
of
them
ay
faith
and
some
others
too
those
who
cost
nothing
take
up
your
time
is
money
under
another
form
now
not
rich
and
then
they
are
all
so
silly
so
silly
can
you
chat
with
a
woman
yourself
as
they
parted
at
the
corner
of
the
pont
neuf
deslauriers
said
agreed
then
you
bring
the
thing
to
me
as
soon
as
you
have
it
agreed
said
frederick
when
he
awoke
next
morning
he
received
through
the
post
a
cheque
on
the
bank
for
fifteen
thousand
francs
this
scrap
of
paper
represented
to
him
fifteen
big
bags
of
money
and
he
said
to
himself
that
with
such
a
sum
he
could
first
of
all
keep
his
carriage
for
three
years
instead
of
selling
it
as
he
would
soon
be
forced
to
do
or
buy
for
himself
two
beautiful
damaskeened
pieces
of
armour
which
he
had
seen
on
the
quai
voltaire
then
a
quantity
of
other
things
pictures
books
and
what
a
quantity
of
bouquets
of
flowers
presents
for
madame
arnoux
anything
in
short
would
have
been
preferable
to
risking
losing
everything
in
that
journal
deslauriers
seemed
to
him
presumptuous
his
insensibility
on
the
night
before
having
chilled
frederick
affection
for
him
and
the
young
man
was
indulging
in
these
feelings
of
regret
when
he
was
quite
surprised
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
arnoux
who
sat
down
heavily
on
the
side
of
the
bed
like
a
man
overwhelmed
with
trouble
what
is
the
matter
now
i
am
ruined
he
had
to
deposit
that
very
day
at
the
office
of
maître
beaumont
notary
in
the
rue
eighteen
thousand
francs
lent
him
by
one
vanneroy
is
an
unaccountable
disaster
i
have
however
given
him
a
mortgage
which
ought
to
keep
him
quiet
but
he
threatens
me
with
a
writ
if
it
is
not
paid
this
afternoon
promptly
and
what
next
oh
the
next
step
is
simple
enough
he
will
take
possession
of
my
real
estate
once
the
thing
is
publicly
announced
it
means
ruin
to
me
that
all
ah
if
i
could
find
anyone
to
advance
me
this
cursed
sum
he
might
take
vanneroy
place
and
i
should
be
saved
you
chance
to
have
it
yourself
the
cheque
had
remained
on
the
near
a
book
frederick
took
up
a
volume
and
placed
it
on
the
cheque
while
he
replied
good
heavens
my
dear
friend
no
but
it
was
painful
to
him
to
say
no
to
arnoux
what
do
you
know
anyone
who
would
nobody
and
to
think
that
in
eight
days
i
should
be
getting
in
money
there
is
owing
to
me
probably
fifty
thousand
francs
at
the
end
of
the
month
could
you
ask
some
of
the
persons
that
owe
you
money
to
make
you
an
advance
ah
well
so
i
did
but
have
you
any
bills
or
promissory
notes
not
one
what
is
to
be
done
said
frederick
that
what
i
asking
myself
said
arnoux
is
for
myself
my
god
but
for
my
children
and
my
poor
wife
then
letting
each
phrase
fall
from
his
lips
in
a
broken
fashion
in
fact
i
could
rough
it
i
could
pack
off
all
i
have
and
go
and
seek
my
fortune
i
do
know
where
impossible
exclaimed
frederick
arnoux
replied
with
an
air
of
calmness
how
do
you
think
i
could
live
in
paris
now
there
was
a
long
silence
frederick
broke
it
by
saying
when
could
you
pay
back
this
money
not
that
he
had
it
quite
the
contrary
but
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
him
from
seeing
some
friends
and
making
an
application
to
them
and
he
rang
for
his
servant
to
get
himself
dressed
arnoux
thanked
him
the
amount
you
want
is
eighteen
thousand
francs
is
it
oh
i
could
manage
easily
with
sixteen
thousand
for
i
could
make
two
thousand
five
hundred
out
of
it
or
get
three
thousand
on
my
silver
plate
if
vanneroy
meanwhile
would
give
me
till
and
i
repeat
to
you
you
may
inform
the
lender
give
him
a
solemn
undertaking
that
in
eight
days
perhaps
even
in
five
or
six
the
money
will
be
reimbursed
besides
the
mortgage
will
be
security
for
it
so
there
is
no
risk
you
understand
frederick
assured
him
that
he
thoroughly
understood
the
state
of
affairs
and
added
that
he
was
going
out
immediately
he
would
be
sure
on
his
return
to
bestow
hearty
maledictions
on
deslauriers
for
he
wished
to
keep
his
word
and
in
the
meantime
to
oblige
arnoux
suppose
i
applied
to
dambreuse
but
on
what
pretext
could
i
ask
for
money
is
i
on
the
contrary
that
should
give
him
some
for
the
shares
i
took
in
his
company
ah
let
him
go
hang
himself
his
shares
i
am
really
not
liable
for
them
and
frederick
applauded
himself
for
his
own
independence
as
if
he
had
refused
to
do
some
service
for
dambreuse
ah
well
said
he
to
himself
afterwards
since
i
going
to
meet
with
a
loss
in
this
way
for
with
fifteen
thousand
francs
i
might
gain
a
hundred
thousand
such
things
sometimes
happen
on
the
bourse
well
then
since
i
am
breaking
my
promise
to
one
of
them
am
i
not
free
besides
when
deslauriers
might
wait
no
no
that
wrong
let
us
go
there
he
looked
at
his
watch
ah
there
no
hurry
the
bank
does
not
close
till
five
and
at
four
when
he
had
cashed
the
cheque
is
useless
now
i
should
not
find
him
in
i
go
this
evening
thus
giving
himself
the
opportunity
of
changing
his
mind
for
there
always
remain
in
the
conscience
some
of
those
sophistries
which
we
pour
into
it
ourselves
it
preserves
the
of
them
like
some
unwholesome
liquor
he
walked
along
the
boulevards
and
dined
alone
at
the
restaurant
then
he
listened
to
one
act
of
a
play
at
the
vaudeville
in
order
to
divert
his
thoughts
but
his
caused
him
as
much
embarrassment
as
if
he
had
stolen
them
he
would
not
have
been
very
sorry
if
he
had
lost
them
when
he
reached
home
again
he
found
a
letter
containing
these
words
what
news
my
wife
joins
me
dear
friend
in
the
hope
yours
and
then
there
was
a
flourish
after
his
signature
his
wife
she
appeals
to
me
at
the
same
moment
arnoux
appeared
to
have
an
answer
as
to
whether
he
had
been
able
to
obtain
the
sum
so
sorely
needed
wait
a
moment
here
it
is
said
frederick
and
hours
later
he
gave
this
reply
to
deslauriers
i
have
no
money
the
advocate
came
back
three
days
one
after
the
other
and
urged
frederick
to
write
to
the
notary
he
even
offered
to
take
a
trip
to
havre
in
connection
with
the
matter
at
the
end
of
the
week
frederick
timidly
asked
the
worthy
arnoux
for
his
fifteen
thousand
francs
arnoux
put
it
off
till
the
following
day
and
then
till
the
day
after
frederick
ventured
out
late
at
night
fearing
lest
deslauriers
might
come
on
him
by
surprise
one
evening
somebody
knocked
against
him
at
the
corner
of
the
madeleine
it
was
he
and
deslauriers
accompanied
frederick
as
far
as
the
door
of
a
house
in
the
faubourg
poissonnière
wait
for
me
he
waited
at
last
after
three
quarters
of
an
hour
frederick
came
out
accompanied
by
arnoux
and
made
signs
to
him
to
have
patience
a
little
longer
the
earthenware
merchant
and
his
companion
went
up
the
rue
de
hauteville
and
then
turned
down
the
rue
de
chabrol
the
night
was
dark
with
gusts
of
tepid
wind
arnoux
walked
on
slowly
talking
about
the
galleries
of
commerce
a
succession
of
covered
passages
which
would
have
led
from
the
boulevard
to
the
châtelet
a
marvellous
speculation
into
which
he
was
very
anxious
to
enter
and
he
stopped
from
time
to
time
in
order
to
have
a
look
at
the
grisettes
faces
in
front
of
the
and
then
raising
his
head
again
resumed
the
thread
of
his
discourse
frederick
heard
deslauriers
steps
behind
him
like
reproaches
like
blows
falling
on
his
conscience
but
he
did
not
venture
to
claim
his
money
through
a
feeling
of
bashfulness
and
also
through
a
fear
that
it
would
be
fruitless
the
other
was
drawing
nearer
he
made
up
his
mind
to
ask
arnoux
in
a
very
flippant
tone
said
that
as
he
had
not
got
in
his
outstanding
debts
he
was
really
unable
to
pay
back
the
fifteen
thousand
francs
you
have
no
need
of
money
i
fancy
at
that
moment
deslauriers
came
up
to
frederick
and
taking
him
aside
be
honest
have
you
got
the
amount
yes
or
no
well
then
no
said
frederick
i
lost
it
ah
and
in
what
way
at
play
deslauriers
without
saying
a
single
word
in
reply
made
a
very
low
bow
and
went
away
arnoux
had
taken
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
light
a
cigar
in
a
tobacconist
shop
when
he
came
back
he
wanted
to
know
from
frederick
who
was
that
young
man
oh
nobody
a
friend
then
three
minutes
later
in
front
of
rosanette
door
come
on
up
said
arnoux
she
be
glad
to
see
you
what
a
savage
you
are
just
now
a
which
was
directly
opposite
threw
its
light
on
him
and
with
his
cigar
between
his
white
teeth
and
his
air
of
contentment
there
was
something
intolerable
about
him
ha
now
that
i
think
of
it
my
notary
has
been
at
your
place
this
morning
about
that
business
is
my
wife
reminded
me
about
it
a
wife
with
brains
returned
frederick
automatically
i
believe
you
and
once
more
arnoux
began
to
sing
his
wife
praises
there
was
no
one
like
her
for
spirit
tenderness
and
thrift
he
added
in
a
low
tone
rolling
his
eyes
about
and
a
woman
with
so
many
charms
too
said
frederick
arnoux
made
a
step
closer
to
him
hold
on
why
are
you
going
and
with
his
hand
out
towards
frederick
he
stared
at
the
young
man
quite
abashed
by
the
look
of
anger
in
his
face
frederick
repeated
in
a
dry
tone
he
hurried
down
the
rue
de
bréda
like
a
stone
rolling
headlong
raging
against
arnoux
swearing
in
his
own
mind
that
he
would
never
see
the
man
again
nor
her
either
so
and
desolate
did
he
feel
in
place
of
the
rupture
which
he
had
anticipated
here
was
the
other
on
the
contrary
exhibiting
towards
her
a
most
perfect
attachment
from
the
ends
of
her
hair
to
the
inmost
depths
of
her
soul
frederick
was
exasperated
by
the
vulgarity
of
this
man
everything
then
belonged
to
him
he
would
meet
arnoux
again
at
his
mistress
door
and
the
mortification
of
a
rupture
would
be
added
to
rage
at
his
own
powerlessness
besides
he
felt
humiliated
by
the
other
display
of
integrity
in
offering
him
guaranties
for
his
money
he
would
have
liked
to
strangle
him
and
over
the
pangs
of
disappointment
floated
in
his
conscience
like
a
fog
the
sense
of
his
baseness
towards
his
friend
rising
tears
nearly
suffocated
him
deslauriers
descended
the
rue
des
martyrs
swearing
aloud
with
indignation
for
his
project
like
an
obelisk
that
has
fallen
now
assumed
extraordinary
proportions
he
considered
himself
robbed
as
if
he
had
suffered
a
great
loss
his
friendship
for
frederick
was
dead
and
he
experienced
a
feeling
of
joy
at
it
it
was
a
sort
of
compensation
to
him
a
hatred
of
all
rich
people
took
possession
of
him
he
leaned
towards
sénécal
opinions
and
resolved
to
make
every
effort
to
propagate
them
all
this
time
arnoux
was
comfortably
seated
in
an
near
the
fire
sipping
his
cup
of
tea
with
the
maréchale
on
his
knees
frederick
did
not
go
back
there
and
in
order
to
distract
his
attention
from
his
disastrous
passion
he
determined
to
write
a
history
of
the
renaissance
he
piled
up
confusedly
on
his
table
the
humanists
the
philosophers
and
the
poets
and
he
went
to
inspect
some
engravings
of
mark
antony
and
tried
to
understand
machiavelli
gradually
the
serenity
of
intellectual
work
had
a
soothing
effect
upon
him
while
his
mind
was
steeped
in
the
personality
of
others
he
lost
sight
of
his
own
which
is
the
only
way
perhaps
of
getting
rid
of
suffering
one
day
while
he
was
quietly
taking
notes
the
door
opened
and
the
announced
madame
arnoux
it
was
she
indeed
and
alone
why
no
for
she
was
holding
little
eugène
by
the
hand
followed
by
a
nurse
in
a
white
apron
she
sat
down
and
after
a
preliminary
cough
it
is
a
long
time
since
you
came
to
see
us
as
frederick
could
think
of
no
excuse
at
the
moment
she
added
it
was
delicacy
on
your
part
he
asked
in
return
delicacy
about
what
about
what
you
have
done
for
arnoux
said
she
frederick
made
a
significant
gesture
what
do
i
care
about
him
indeed
it
was
for
your
sake
i
did
it
she
sent
off
the
child
to
play
with
his
nurse
in
the
two
or
three
words
passed
between
them
as
to
their
state
of
health
then
the
conversation
hung
fire
she
wore
a
brown
silk
gown
which
had
the
colour
of
spanish
wine
with
a
paletot
of
black
velvet
bordered
with
sable
this
fur
made
him
yearn
to
pass
his
hand
over
it
and
her
so
long
and
so
exquisitely
smooth
seemed
to
draw
his
lips
towards
them
but
he
was
agitated
by
emotion
and
turning
his
eyes
towards
the
door
is
rather
warm
here
frederick
understood
what
her
discreet
glance
meant
ah
excuse
me
the
two
leaves
of
the
door
are
merely
drawn
together
yes
that
true
and
she
smiled
as
much
as
to
say
i
not
a
bit
afraid
he
asked
her
presently
what
was
the
object
of
her
visit
my
husband
she
replied
with
an
effort
has
urged
me
to
call
on
you
not
venturing
to
take
this
step
himself
and
why
you
know
dambreuse
do
you
yes
slightly
ah
slightly
she
relapsed
into
silence
no
matter
finish
what
you
were
going
to
say
thereupon
she
told
him
that
two
days
before
arnoux
had
found
himself
unable
to
meet
four
bills
of
a
thousand
francs
made
payable
at
the
banker
order
and
with
his
signature
attached
to
them
she
felt
sorry
for
having
compromised
her
children
fortune
but
anything
was
preferable
to
dishonour
and
if
dambreuse
stopped
the
proceedings
they
would
certainly
pay
him
soon
for
she
was
going
to
sell
a
little
house
which
she
had
at
chartres
poor
woman
murmured
frederick
i
will
go
rely
on
me
thanks
and
she
arose
to
go
oh
there
is
nothing
to
hurry
you
yet
she
remained
standing
examining
the
trophy
of
mongolian
arrows
suspended
from
the
ceiling
the
bookcase
the
bindings
all
the
utensils
for
writing
she
lifted
up
the
bronze
bowl
which
held
his
pens
her
feet
rested
on
different
portions
of
the
carpet
she
had
visited
frederick
several
times
before
but
always
accompanied
by
arnoux
they
were
now
alone
together
alone
in
his
own
house
it
was
an
extraordinary
event
almost
a
successful
issue
of
his
love
she
wished
to
see
his
little
garden
he
offered
her
his
arm
to
show
her
his
property
thirty
feet
of
ground
enclosed
by
some
houses
adorned
with
shrubs
at
the
corners
and
in
the
middle
the
early
days
of
april
had
arrived
the
leaves
of
the
lilacs
were
already
showing
their
borders
of
green
a
breath
of
pure
air
was
diffused
around
and
the
little
birds
chirped
their
song
alternating
with
the
distant
sound
that
came
from
a
coachmaker
forge
frederick
went
to
look
for
a
and
while
they
walked
on
side
by
side
the
child
kept
making
in
the
walk
madame
arnoux
did
not
believe
that
as
he
grew
older
he
would
have
a
great
imagination
but
he
had
a
winning
disposition
his
sister
on
the
other
hand
possessed
a
caustic
humour
that
sometimes
wounded
her
that
will
change
said
frederick
we
must
never
despair
she
returned
we
must
never
despair
this
automatic
repetition
of
the
phrase
he
had
used
appeared
to
him
a
sort
of
encouragement
he
plucked
a
rose
the
only
one
in
the
garden
do
you
remember
a
certain
bouquet
of
roses
one
evening
in
a
carriage
she
coloured
a
little
and
with
an
air
of
bantering
pity
ah
i
was
very
young
then
and
this
one
went
on
frederick
in
a
low
tone
will
it
be
the
same
way
with
it
she
replied
while
turning
about
the
stem
between
her
fingers
like
the
thread
of
a
spindle
no
i
will
preserve
it
she
called
over
the
nurse
who
took
the
child
in
her
arms
then
on
the
threshold
of
the
door
in
the
street
madame
arnoux
inhaled
the
odour
of
the
flower
leaning
her
head
on
her
shoulder
with
a
look
as
sweet
as
a
kiss
when
he
had
gone
up
to
his
study
he
gazed
at
the
armchair
in
which
she
had
sat
and
every
object
which
she
had
touched
some
portion
of
her
was
diffused
around
him
the
caress
of
her
presence
lingered
there
still
so
then
she
came
here
said
he
to
himself
and
his
soul
was
bathed
in
the
waves
of
infinite
tenderness
next
morning
at
eleven
he
presented
himself
at
house
he
was
received
in
the
the
banker
was
seated
opposite
his
wife
at
breakfast
beside
her
sat
his
niece
and
at
the
other
side
of
the
table
appeared
the
governess
an
english
woman
strongly
pitted
with
dambreuse
invited
his
young
friend
to
take
his
place
among
them
and
when
he
declined
what
can
i
do
for
you
i
am
listening
to
whatever
you
have
to
say
to
me
frederick
confessed
while
affecting
indifference
that
he
had
come
to
make
a
request
in
behalf
of
one
arnoux
ha
ha
the
said
the
banker
with
a
noiseless
laugh
which
exposed
his
gums
oudry
formerly
gave
security
for
him
he
has
given
a
lot
of
trouble
and
he
proceeded
to
read
the
letters
and
newspapers
which
lay
close
beside
him
on
the
table
two
servants
attended
without
making
the
least
noise
on
the
floor
and
the
loftiness
of
the
apartment
which
had
three
portières
of
richest
tapestry
and
two
white
marble
fountains
the
polish
of
the
the
arrangement
of
the
and
even
the
rigid
folds
of
the
napkins
all
this
sumptuous
comfort
impressed
mind
with
the
contrast
between
it
and
another
breakfast
at
the
house
he
did
not
take
the
liberty
of
interrupting
dambreuse
madame
noticed
his
embarrassment
do
you
occasionally
see
our
friend
martinon
he
will
be
here
this
evening
said
the
young
girl
in
a
lively
tone
ha
so
you
know
him
said
her
aunt
fixing
on
her
a
freezing
look
at
that
moment
one
of
the
bending
forward
whispered
in
her
ear
your
dressmaker
mademoiselle
miss
john
and
the
governess
in
obedience
to
this
summons
left
the
room
along
with
her
pupil
dambreuse
annoyed
at
the
disarrangement
of
the
chairs
by
this
movement
asked
what
was
the
matter
is
madame
regimbart
wait
a
moment
regimbart
i
know
that
name
i
have
come
across
his
signature
frederick
at
length
broached
the
question
arnoux
deserved
some
consideration
he
was
even
going
for
the
sole
purpose
of
fulfilling
his
engagements
to
sell
a
house
belonging
to
his
wife
she
is
considered
very
pretty
said
madame
dambreuse
the
banker
added
with
a
display
of
are
you
on
friendly
terms
with
them
on
intimate
terms
frederick
without
giving
an
explicit
reply
said
that
he
would
be
very
much
obliged
to
him
if
he
considered
the
matter
well
since
it
pleases
you
be
it
so
we
will
wait
i
have
some
time
to
spare
yet
suppose
we
go
down
to
my
office
would
you
mind
they
had
finished
breakfast
madame
dambreuse
bowed
slightly
towards
frederick
smiling
in
a
singular
fashion
with
a
mixture
of
politeness
and
irony
frederick
had
no
time
to
reflect
about
it
for
dambreuse
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
you
did
not
come
to
get
your
shares
and
without
permitting
him
to
make
any
excuses
well
well
is
right
that
you
should
know
a
little
more
about
the
business
he
offered
frederick
a
cigarette
and
began
his
statement
the
general
union
of
french
coal
mines
had
been
constituted
all
that
they
were
waiting
for
was
the
order
for
its
incorporation
the
mere
fact
of
the
amalgamation
had
diminished
the
cost
of
superintendence
and
of
manual
labour
and
increased
the
profits
besides
the
company
had
conceived
a
new
idea
which
was
to
interest
the
workmen
in
its
undertaking
it
would
erect
houses
for
them
healthful
dwellings
finally
it
would
constitute
itself
the
purveyor
of
its
and
would
have
everything
supplied
to
them
at
net
prices
and
they
will
be
the
gainers
by
it
monsieur
there
true
progress
that
the
way
to
reply
effectively
to
certain
republican
brawlings
we
have
on
our
board
he
showed
the
prospectus
a
peer
of
france
a
scholar
who
is
a
member
of
the
institute
a
retired
of
genius
such
elements
reassure
the
timid
capitalists
and
appeal
to
intelligent
capitalists
the
company
would
have
in
its
favour
the
sanction
of
the
state
then
the
railways
the
steam
service
the
metallurgical
establishments
the
gas
companies
and
ordinary
households
thus
we
heat
we
light
we
penetrate
to
the
very
hearth
of
the
humblest
home
but
how
you
will
say
to
me
can
we
be
sure
of
selling
by
the
aid
of
protective
laws
dear
monsieur
and
we
shall
get
them
that
is
a
matter
that
concerns
us
for
my
part
however
i
am
a
downright
prohibitionist
the
country
before
anything
he
had
been
appointed
a
director
but
he
had
no
time
to
occupy
himself
with
certain
details
amongst
other
things
with
the
editing
of
their
publications
i
find
myself
rather
muddled
with
my
authors
i
have
forgotten
my
greek
i
should
want
some
one
who
could
put
my
ideas
into
shape
and
suddenly
will
you
be
the
man
to
perform
those
duties
with
the
title
of
general
secretary
frederick
did
not
know
what
reply
to
make
well
what
is
there
to
prevent
you
his
functions
would
be
confined
to
writing
a
report
every
year
for
the
shareholders
he
would
find
himself
day
after
day
in
communication
with
the
most
notable
men
in
paris
representing
the
company
with
the
workmen
he
would
ere
long
be
worshipped
by
them
as
a
natural
consequence
and
by
this
means
he
would
be
able
later
to
push
him
into
the
general
council
and
into
the
position
of
a
deputy
frederick
ears
tingled
whence
came
this
goodwill
he
got
confused
in
returning
thanks
but
it
was
not
necessary
the
banker
said
that
he
should
be
dependent
on
anyone
the
best
course
was
to
take
some
shares
a
splendid
investment
besides
for
your
capital
guarantees
your
position
as
your
position
does
your
capital
about
how
much
should
it
amount
to
said
frederick
oh
well
whatever
you
please
from
forty
to
sixty
thousand
francs
i
suppose
this
sum
was
so
trifling
in
dambreuse
eyes
and
his
authority
was
so
great
that
the
young
man
resolved
immediately
to
sell
a
farm
he
accepted
the
offer
dambreuse
was
to
select
one
of
his
disengaged
days
for
an
appointment
in
order
to
finish
their
arrangements
so
i
can
say
to
jacques
arnoux
anything
you
like
the
poor
chap
anything
you
like
frederick
wrote
to
the
arnouxs
to
make
their
minds
easy
and
he
despatched
the
letter
by
a
who
brought
back
the
letter
all
right
his
action
in
the
matter
deserved
better
recognition
he
expected
a
visit
or
at
least
a
letter
he
did
not
receive
a
visit
and
no
letter
arrived
was
it
forgetfulness
on
their
part
or
was
it
intentional
since
madame
arnoux
had
come
once
what
was
to
prevent
her
from
coming
again
the
species
of
confidence
of
avowal
of
which
she
had
made
him
the
recipient
on
the
occasion
was
nothing
better
then
than
a
manoeuvre
which
she
had
executed
through
interested
motives
are
they
playing
on
me
and
is
she
an
accomplice
of
her
husband
a
sort
of
shame
in
spite
of
his
desire
prevented
him
from
returning
to
their
house
one
morning
three
weeks
after
their
interview
dambreuse
wrote
to
him
saying
that
he
expected
him
the
same
day
in
an
hour
time
on
the
way
the
thought
of
arnoux
oppressed
him
once
more
and
not
having
been
able
to
discover
any
reason
for
his
conduct
he
was
seized
with
a
feeling
of
wretchedness
a
melancholy
presentiment
in
order
to
shake
it
off
he
hailed
a
cab
and
drove
to
the
rue
de
paradis
arnoux
was
away
travelling
and
madame
in
the
country
at
the
works
when
is
monsieur
coming
back
without
fail
he
would
find
her
alone
this
was
the
opportune
moment
something
imperious
seemed
to
cry
out
in
the
depths
of
his
consciousness
go
then
and
meet
her
but
dambreuse
ah
well
so
much
the
worse
i
say
that
i
was
he
rushed
to
the
and
as
soon
as
he
was
in
the
carriage
perhaps
i
have
done
wrong
pshaw
what
does
it
matter
green
plains
stretched
out
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
the
train
rolled
on
the
little
glistened
like
and
the
smoke
of
the
locomotive
kept
constantly
sending
forth
on
the
same
side
its
big
fleecy
masses
which
danced
for
a
little
while
on
the
grass
and
were
then
dispersed
frederick
who
sat
alone
in
his
compartment
gazed
at
these
objects
through
sheer
weariness
lost
in
that
languor
which
is
produced
by
the
very
excess
of
impatience
but
cranes
and
warehouses
presently
appeared
they
had
reached
creil
the
town
built
on
the
slopes
of
two
hills
the
first
of
which
was
bare
and
the
second
crowned
by
a
wood
with
its
its
houses
of
unequal
size
and
its
stone
bridge
seemed
to
him
to
present
an
aspect
of
mingled
gaiety
reserve
and
propriety
a
long
flat
barge
descended
to
the
edge
of
the
water
which
leaped
up
under
the
lash
of
the
wind
fowl
perched
on
the
straw
at
the
foot
of
the
crucifix
erected
on
the
spot
a
woman
passed
with
some
wet
linen
on
her
head
after
crossing
the
bridge
he
found
himself
in
an
isle
where
he
beheld
on
his
right
the
ruins
of
an
abbey
a
mill
with
its
wheels
revolving
barred
up
the
entire
width
of
the
second
arm
of
the
oise
over
which
the
manufactory
projected
frederick
was
greatly
surprised
by
the
imposing
character
of
this
structure
he
felt
more
respect
for
arnoux
on
account
of
it
three
paces
further
on
he
turned
up
an
alley
which
had
a
grating
at
its
lower
end
he
went
in
the
called
him
back
exclaiming
have
you
a
permit
for
what
purpose
for
the
purpose
of
visiting
the
establishment
frederick
said
in
a
rather
curt
tone
that
he
had
come
to
see
arnoux
who
is
m
arnoux
why
the
chief
the
master
the
proprietor
in
fact
no
monsieur
these
are
mm
leboeuf
and
milliet
works
the
good
woman
was
surely
joking
some
workmen
arrived
he
came
up
and
spoke
to
two
or
three
of
them
they
gave
the
same
response
frederick
left
the
premises
staggering
like
a
drunken
man
and
he
had
such
a
look
of
perplexity
that
on
the
pont
de
la
boucherie
an
inhabitant
of
the
town
who
was
smoking
his
pipe
asked
whether
he
wanted
to
find
out
anything
this
man
knew
where
arnoux
manufactory
was
it
was
situated
at
montataire
frederick
asked
whether
a
vehicle
was
to
be
got
he
was
told
that
the
only
place
where
he
could
find
one
was
at
the
station
he
went
back
there
a
calash
to
which
was
yoked
an
old
horse
with
torn
harness
hanging
over
the
shafts
stood
all
alone
in
front
of
the
luggage
office
an
urchin
who
was
looking
on
offered
to
go
and
find
père
pilon
in
ten
minutes
time
he
came
back
and
announced
that
père
pilon
was
at
his
breakfast
frederick
unable
to
stand
this
any
longer
walked
away
but
the
gates
of
the
thoroughfare
across
the
line
were
closed
he
would
have
to
wait
till
two
trains
had
passed
at
last
he
made
a
dash
into
the
open
country
the
monotonous
greenery
made
it
look
like
the
cover
of
an
immense
the
scoriæ
of
iron
were
ranged
on
both
sides
of
the
track
like
heaps
of
stones
a
little
further
on
some
factory
chimneys
were
smoking
close
beside
each
other
in
front
of
him
on
a
round
hillock
stood
a
little
turreted
château
with
the
quadrangular
belfry
of
a
church
at
a
lower
level
long
walls
formed
irregular
lines
past
the
trees
and
further
down
again
the
houses
of
the
village
spread
out
they
had
only
a
single
story
with
staircases
consisting
of
three
steps
made
of
uncemented
blocks
every
now
and
then
the
bell
in
front
of
a
could
be
heard
tinkling
heavy
steps
sank
into
the
black
mire
and
a
light
shower
was
falling
which
cut
the
pale
sky
with
a
thousand
hatchings
frederick
pursued
his
way
along
the
middle
of
the
street
then
he
saw
on
his
left
at
the
opening
of
a
pathway
a
large
wooden
arch
whereon
was
traced
in
letters
of
gold
the
word
faïences
it
was
not
without
an
object
that
jacques
arnoux
had
selected
the
vicinity
of
creil
by
placing
his
works
as
close
as
possible
to
the
other
works
which
had
long
enjoyed
a
high
reputation
he
had
created
a
certain
confusion
in
the
public
mind
with
a
favourable
result
so
far
as
his
own
interests
were
concerned
the
main
body
of
the
building
rested
on
the
same
bank
of
a
river
which
flows
through
the
meadowlands
the
master
house
surrounded
by
a
garden
could
be
distinguished
by
the
steps
in
front
of
it
adorned
with
four
vases
in
which
cactuses
were
bristling
heaps
of
white
clay
were
drying
under
sheds
there
were
others
in
the
open
air
and
in
the
midst
of
the
yard
stood
sénécal
with
his
everlasting
blue
paletot
lined
with
red
the
extended
towards
frederick
his
cold
hand
you
come
to
see
the
master
he
not
there
frederick
nonplussed
replied
in
a
stupefied
fashion
i
knew
it
but
the
next
moment
correcting
himself
is
about
a
matter
that
concerns
madame
arnoux
can
she
receive
me
ha
i
have
not
seen
her
for
the
last
three
days
said
sénécal
and
he
broke
into
a
long
string
of
complaints
when
he
accepted
the
post
of
manager
he
understood
that
he
would
have
been
allowed
to
reside
in
paris
and
not
be
forced
to
bury
himself
in
this
country
district
far
from
his
friends
deprived
of
newspapers
no
matter
he
had
overlooked
all
that
but
arnoux
appeared
to
pay
no
heed
to
his
merits
he
was
moreover
shallow
and
retrograde
no
one
could
be
more
ignorant
in
place
of
seeking
for
artistic
improvements
it
would
have
been
better
to
introduce
firewood
instead
of
coal
and
gas
the
spirit
itself
sénécal
laid
stress
on
the
last
words
in
short
he
disliked
his
present
occupation
and
he
all
but
appealed
to
frederick
to
say
a
word
in
his
behalf
in
order
that
he
might
get
an
increase
of
salary
make
your
mind
easy
said
the
other
he
met
nobody
on
the
staircase
on
the
first
floor
he
pushed
his
way
into
an
empty
room
it
was
the
he
called
out
at
the
top
of
his
voice
there
was
no
reply
no
doubt
the
cook
had
gone
out
and
so
had
the
housemaid
at
length
having
reached
the
second
floor
he
pushed
a
door
open
madame
arnoux
was
alone
in
this
room
in
front
of
a
press
with
a
mirror
attached
the
belt
of
her
hung
down
her
hips
one
entire
half
of
her
hair
fell
in
a
dark
wave
over
her
right
shoulder
and
she
had
raised
both
arms
in
order
to
hold
up
her
chignon
with
one
hand
and
to
put
a
pin
through
it
with
the
other
she
broke
into
an
exclamation
and
disappeared
then
she
came
back
again
properly
dressed
her
waist
her
eyes
the
rustle
of
her
dress
her
entire
appearance
charmed
him
frederick
felt
it
hard
to
keep
from
covering
her
with
kisses
i
beg
your
pardon
said
she
but
i
could
not
he
had
the
boldness
to
interrupt
her
with
these
words
nevertheless
you
looked
very
nice
just
now
she
probably
thought
this
compliment
a
little
coarse
for
her
cheeks
reddened
he
was
afraid
that
he
might
have
offended
her
she
went
on
what
lucky
chance
has
brought
you
here
he
did
not
know
what
reply
to
make
and
after
a
slight
chuckle
which
gave
him
time
for
reflection
if
i
told
you
would
you
believe
me
why
not
frederick
informed
her
that
he
had
had
a
frightful
dream
a
few
nights
before
i
dreamt
that
you
were
seriously
ill
near
dying
oh
my
husband
and
i
are
never
i
have
dreamt
only
of
you
said
he
she
gazed
at
him
calmly
dreams
are
not
always
realised
frederick
stammered
sought
to
find
appropriate
words
to
express
himself
in
and
then
plunged
into
a
flowing
period
about
the
affinity
of
souls
there
existed
a
force
which
could
through
the
intervening
bounds
of
space
bring
two
persons
into
communication
with
each
other
make
known
to
each
the
other
feelings
and
enable
them
to
reunite
she
listened
to
him
with
downcast
face
while
she
smiled
with
that
beautiful
smile
of
hers
he
watched
her
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
with
delight
and
poured
out
his
love
all
the
more
freely
through
the
easy
channel
of
a
commonplace
remark
she
offered
to
show
him
the
works
and
as
she
persisted
he
made
no
objection
in
order
to
divert
his
attention
with
something
of
an
amusing
nature
she
showed
him
the
species
of
museum
that
decorated
the
staircase
the
specimens
hung
up
against
the
wall
or
laid
on
shelves
bore
witness
to
the
efforts
and
the
successive
fads
of
arnoux
after
seeking
vainly
for
the
red
of
chinese
copper
he
had
wished
to
manufacture
majolicas
faiënce
etruscan
and
oriental
ware
and
had
in
fact
attempted
all
the
improvements
which
were
realised
at
a
later
period
so
it
was
that
one
could
observe
in
the
series
big
vases
covered
with
figures
of
mandarins
porringers
of
shot
pots
adorned
with
arabian
inscriptions
in
the
style
of
the
renaissance
and
large
plates
on
which
two
personages
were
outlined
as
it
were
on
bloodstone
in
a
delicate
aërial
fashion
he
now
made
letters
for
signboards
and
but
his
intelligence
was
not
high
enough
to
attain
to
art
nor
commonplace
enough
to
look
merely
to
profit
so
that
without
satisfying
anyone
he
had
ruined
himself
they
were
both
taking
a
view
of
these
things
when
mademoiselle
marthe
passed
so
then
you
did
not
recognise
him
said
her
mother
to
her
yes
indeed
she
replied
bowing
to
him
while
her
clear
and
sceptical
glance
the
glance
of
a
virgin
seemed
to
say
in
a
whisper
what
are
you
coming
here
for
and
she
rushed
up
the
steps
with
her
head
slightly
bent
over
her
shoulder
madame
arnoux
led
frederick
into
the
yard
attached
to
the
works
and
then
explained
to
him
in
a
grave
tone
how
different
clays
were
ground
cleaned
and
sifted
the
most
important
thing
is
the
preparation
of
pastes
and
she
introduced
him
into
a
hall
filled
with
vats
in
which
a
vertical
axis
with
horizontal
arms
kept
turning
frederick
felt
some
regret
that
he
had
not
flatly
declined
her
offer
a
little
while
before
these
things
are
merely
the
slobberings
said
she
he
thought
the
word
grotesque
and
in
a
measure
unbecoming
on
her
lips
wide
straps
ran
from
one
end
of
the
ceiling
to
the
other
so
as
to
roll
themselves
round
the
drums
and
everything
kept
moving
continuously
with
a
provoking
mathematical
regularity
they
left
the
spot
and
passed
close
to
a
ruined
hut
which
had
formerly
been
used
as
a
repository
for
gardening
implements
it
is
no
longer
of
any
use
said
madame
arnoux
he
replied
in
a
tremulous
voice
happiness
may
have
been
associated
with
it
the
clacking
of
the
drowned
his
words
and
they
entered
the
workshop
where
rough
drafts
were
made
some
men
seated
at
a
narrow
table
placed
each
in
front
of
himself
on
a
revolving
disc
a
piece
of
paste
then
each
man
with
his
left
hand
scooped
out
the
insides
of
his
own
piece
while
smoothing
its
surface
with
the
right
and
vases
could
be
seen
bursting
into
shape
like
blossoming
flowers
madame
arnoux
had
the
moulds
for
more
difficult
works
shown
to
him
in
another
portion
of
the
building
the
threads
the
necks
and
the
projecting
lines
were
being
formed
on
the
floor
above
they
removed
the
seams
and
stopped
up
with
plaster
the
little
holes
that
had
been
left
by
the
preceding
operations
at
every
opening
in
the
walls
in
corners
in
the
middle
of
the
corridor
everywhere
earthenware
vessels
had
been
placed
side
by
side
frederick
began
to
feel
bored
perhaps
these
things
are
tiresome
to
you
said
she
fearing
lest
it
might
be
necessary
to
terminate
his
visit
there
and
then
he
affected
on
the
contrary
a
tone
of
great
enthusiasm
he
even
expressed
regret
at
not
having
devoted
himself
to
this
branch
of
industry
she
appeared
surprised
certainly
i
would
have
been
able
to
live
near
you
and
as
he
tried
to
catch
her
eye
madame
arnoux
in
order
to
avoid
him
took
off
a
bracket
little
balls
of
paste
which
had
come
from
abortive
readjustments
flattened
them
out
into
a
thin
cake
and
pressed
her
hand
over
them
might
i
carry
these
away
with
me
said
frederick
good
heavens
are
you
so
childish
he
was
about
to
reply
when
in
came
sénécal
the
on
the
threshold
had
noticed
a
breach
of
the
rules
the
workshops
should
be
swept
every
week
this
was
saturday
and
as
the
workmen
had
not
done
what
was
required
sénécal
announced
that
they
would
have
to
remain
an
hour
longer
so
much
the
worse
for
you
they
stooped
over
the
work
assigned
to
them
unmurmuringly
but
their
rage
could
be
divined
by
the
hoarse
sounds
which
came
from
their
chests
they
were
moreover
very
easy
to
manage
having
all
been
dismissed
from
the
big
manufactory
the
republican
had
shown
himself
a
hard
taskmaster
to
them
a
mere
theorist
he
regarded
the
people
only
in
the
mass
and
exhibited
an
utter
absence
of
pity
for
individuals
frederick
annoyed
by
his
presence
asked
madame
arnoux
in
a
low
tone
whether
they
could
have
an
opportunity
of
seeing
the
kilns
they
descended
to
the
and
she
was
just
explaining
the
use
of
caskets
when
sénécal
who
had
followed
close
behind
placed
himself
between
them
he
continued
the
explanation
of
his
own
motion
expatiated
on
the
various
kinds
of
combustibles
the
process
of
placing
in
the
kiln
the
pyroscopes
the
cylindrical
furnaces
the
instruments
for
rounding
the
lustres
and
the
metals
making
a
prodigious
display
of
chemical
terms
such
as
chloride
sulphuret
borax
and
carbonate
frederick
did
not
understand
a
single
one
of
them
and
kept
turning
round
every
minute
towards
madame
arnoux
you
are
not
listening
said
she
sénécal
however
is
very
clear
he
knows
all
these
things
much
better
than
i
the
mathematician
flattered
by
this
eulogy
proposed
to
show
the
way
in
which
colours
were
laid
on
frederick
gave
madame
arnoux
an
anxious
questioning
look
she
remained
impassive
not
caring
to
be
alone
with
him
very
probably
and
yet
unwilling
to
leave
him
he
offered
her
his
arm
no
many
thanks
the
staircase
is
too
narrow
and
when
they
had
reached
the
top
sénécal
opened
the
door
of
an
apartment
filled
with
women
they
were
handling
brushes
phials
shells
and
plates
of
glass
along
the
cornice
close
to
the
wall
extended
boards
with
figures
engraved
on
them
scraps
of
thin
paper
floated
about
and
a
sent
forth
fumes
that
made
the
temperature
oppressive
while
there
mingled
with
it
the
odour
of
turpentine
the
workwomen
had
nearly
all
sordid
costumes
it
was
noticeable
however
that
one
of
them
wore
a
madras
handkerchief
and
long
earrings
of
slight
frame
and
at
the
same
time
plump
she
had
large
black
eyes
and
the
fleshy
lips
of
a
negress
her
ample
bosom
projected
from
under
her
chemise
which
was
fastened
round
her
waist
by
the
string
of
her
petticoat
and
with
one
elbow
on
the
board
of
the
and
the
other
arm
hanging
down
she
gazed
vaguely
at
the
open
country
a
long
distance
away
beside
her
were
a
bottle
of
wine
and
some
pork
chops
the
regulations
prohibited
eating
in
the
workshops
a
rule
intended
to
secure
cleanliness
at
work
and
to
keep
the
hands
in
a
healthy
condition
sénécal
through
a
sense
of
duty
or
a
longing
to
exercise
despotic
authority
shouted
out
to
her
ere
he
had
come
near
her
while
pointing
towards
a
framed
placard
i
say
you
girl
from
bordeaux
over
there
read
out
for
me
article
well
what
then
what
then
mademoiselle
you
have
to
pay
a
fine
of
three
francs
she
looked
him
straight
in
the
face
in
an
impudent
fashion
what
does
that
signify
to
me
the
master
will
take
off
your
fine
when
he
comes
back
i
laugh
at
you
my
good
man
sénécal
who
was
walking
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
like
an
usher
in
the
contented
himself
with
smiling
article
insubordination
ten
francs
the
girl
from
bordeaux
resumed
her
work
madame
arnoux
through
a
sense
of
propriety
said
nothing
but
her
brows
contracted
frederick
murmured
ha
you
are
very
severe
for
a
democrat
the
other
replied
in
a
magisterial
tone
democracy
is
not
the
unbounded
license
of
individualism
it
is
the
equality
of
all
belonging
to
the
same
community
before
the
law
the
distribution
of
work
order
you
are
forgetting
humanity
said
frederick
madame
arnoux
took
his
arm
sénécal
perhaps
offended
by
this
mark
of
silent
approbation
went
away
frederick
experienced
an
immense
relief
since
morning
he
had
been
looking
out
for
the
opportunity
to
declare
itself
now
it
had
arrived
besides
madame
arnoux
spontaneous
movements
seemed
to
him
to
contain
promises
and
he
asked
her
as
if
on
the
pretext
of
warming
their
feet
to
come
up
to
her
room
but
when
he
was
seated
close
beside
her
he
began
once
more
to
feel
embarrassed
he
was
at
a
loss
for
a
sénécal
luckily
suggested
an
idea
to
his
mind
nothing
could
be
more
stupid
said
he
than
this
punishment
madame
arnoux
replied
there
are
certain
severe
measures
which
are
indispensable
what
you
who
are
so
good
oh
i
am
mistaken
for
you
sometimes
take
pleasure
in
making
other
people
suffer
i
do
understand
riddles
my
friend
and
her
austere
look
still
more
than
the
words
she
used
checked
him
frederick
was
determined
to
go
on
a
volume
of
de
musset
chanced
to
be
on
the
chest
of
drawers
he
turned
over
some
pages
then
began
to
talk
about
love
about
his
hopes
and
his
transports
all
this
according
to
madame
arnoux
was
criminal
or
factitious
the
young
man
felt
wounded
by
this
negative
attitude
with
regard
to
his
passion
and
in
order
to
combat
it
he
cited
by
way
of
proof
the
suicides
which
they
read
about
every
day
in
the
newspapers
extolled
the
great
literary
types
phèdre
dido
romeo
desgrieux
he
talked
as
if
he
meant
to
do
away
with
himself
the
fire
was
no
longer
burning
on
the
hearth
the
rain
lashed
against
the
madame
arnoux
without
stirring
remained
with
her
hands
resting
on
the
sides
of
her
armchair
the
flaps
of
her
cap
fell
like
the
fillets
of
a
sphinx
her
pure
profile
traced
out
its
outlines
in
the
midst
of
the
shadow
he
was
anxious
to
cast
himself
at
her
feet
there
was
a
creaking
sound
in
the
lobby
and
he
did
not
venture
to
carry
out
his
intention
he
was
moreover
restrained
by
a
kind
of
religious
awe
that
robe
mingling
with
the
surrounding
shadows
appeared
to
him
boundless
infinite
incapable
of
being
touched
and
for
this
very
reason
his
desire
became
intensified
but
the
fear
of
doing
too
much
and
again
of
not
doing
enough
deprived
him
of
all
judgment
if
she
dislikes
me
he
thought
let
her
drive
me
away
if
she
cares
for
me
let
her
encourage
me
he
said
with
a
sigh
so
then
you
do
admit
that
a
man
may
love
a
woman
madame
arnoux
replied
assuming
that
she
is
at
liberty
to
marry
he
may
marry
her
when
she
belongs
to
another
he
should
keep
away
from
her
so
happiness
is
impossible
no
but
it
is
never
to
be
found
in
falsehood
mental
anxiety
and
remorse
what
does
it
matter
if
one
is
compensated
by
the
enjoyment
of
supreme
bliss
the
experience
is
too
costly
then
he
sought
to
assail
her
with
irony
would
not
virtue
in
that
case
be
merely
cowardice
say
rather
even
for
those
women
who
might
forget
duty
or
religion
simple
good
sense
is
sufficient
a
solid
foundation
for
wisdom
may
be
found
in
ah
what
maxims
these
are
of
yours
but
i
do
boast
of
being
a
fine
lady
at
that
moment
the
little
boy
rushed
in
mamma
are
you
coming
to
dinner
yes
in
a
moment
frederick
arose
at
the
same
instant
marthe
made
her
appearance
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
go
away
and
with
a
look
of
entreaty
these
women
you
speak
of
are
very
unfeeling
then
no
but
deaf
when
it
is
necessary
to
be
so
and
she
remained
standing
on
the
threshold
of
her
room
with
her
two
children
beside
her
he
bowed
without
saying
a
word
she
mutely
returned
his
salutation
what
he
first
experienced
was
an
unspeakable
astonishment
he
felt
crushed
by
this
mode
of
impressing
on
him
the
emptiness
of
his
hopes
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
he
were
lost
like
a
man
who
has
fallen
to
the
bottom
of
an
abyss
and
knows
that
no
help
will
come
to
him
and
that
he
must
die
he
walked
on
however
but
at
random
without
looking
before
him
he
knocked
against
stones
he
mistook
his
way
a
clatter
of
wooden
shoes
sounded
close
to
his
ear
it
was
caused
by
some
of
the
who
were
leaving
the
foundry
then
he
realised
where
he
was
the
railway
lamps
traced
on
the
horizon
a
line
of
flames
he
arrived
just
as
the
train
was
starting
let
himself
be
pushed
into
a
carriage
and
fell
asleep
an
hour
later
on
the
boulevards
the
gaiety
of
paris
by
night
made
his
journey
all
at
once
recede
into
an
already
past
he
resolved
to
be
strong
and
relieved
his
heart
by
vilifying
madame
arnoux
with
insulting
epithets
she
is
an
idiot
a
goose
a
mere
brute
let
us
not
bestow
another
thought
on
her
when
he
got
home
he
found
in
his
study
a
letter
of
eight
pages
on
blue
glazed
paper
with
the
initials
r
a
it
began
with
friendly
reproaches
what
has
become
of
you
my
dear
i
am
getting
quite
bored
but
the
handwriting
was
so
abominable
that
frederick
was
about
to
fling
away
the
entire
bundle
of
sheets
when
he
noticed
in
the
postscript
the
following
words
i
count
on
you
to
come
and
drive
me
to
the
races
what
was
the
meaning
of
this
invitation
was
it
another
trick
of
the
maréchale
but
a
woman
does
not
make
a
fool
of
the
same
man
twice
without
some
object
and
seized
with
curiosity
he
read
the
letter
over
again
attentively
frederick
was
able
to
distinguish
misunderstanding
to
have
taken
a
wrong
path
disillusions
poor
children
that
we
are
like
two
rivers
that
join
each
other
etc
he
kept
the
sheets
for
a
long
time
between
his
fingers
they
had
the
odour
of
orris
and
there
was
in
the
form
of
the
characters
and
the
irregular
spaces
between
the
lines
something
suggestive
as
it
were
of
a
disorderly
toilet
that
fired
his
blood
why
should
i
not
go
said
he
to
himself
at
length
but
if
madame
arnoux
were
to
know
about
it
ah
let
her
know
so
much
the
better
and
let
her
feel
jealous
over
it
in
that
way
i
shall
be
avenged
chapter
x
at
the
races
the
maréchale
was
prepared
for
his
visit
and
had
been
awaiting
him
this
is
nice
of
you
she
said
fixing
a
glance
of
her
fine
eyes
on
his
face
with
an
expression
at
the
same
time
tender
and
mirthful
when
she
had
fastened
her
she
sat
down
on
the
divan
and
remained
silent
shall
we
go
said
frederick
she
looked
at
the
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
oh
no
not
before
one
as
if
she
had
imposed
this
limit
to
her
indecision
at
last
when
the
hour
had
struck
ah
well
caro
and
she
gave
a
final
touch
to
her
and
left
directions
for
delphine
is
madame
coming
home
to
dinner
why
should
we
indeed
we
shall
dine
together
somewhere
at
the
café
anglais
wherever
you
wish
be
it
so
her
little
dogs
began
yelping
around
her
we
can
bring
them
with
us
ca
we
frederick
carried
them
himself
to
the
vehicle
it
was
a
hired
berlin
with
two
and
a
postilion
he
had
put
his
in
the
back
seat
the
maréchale
appeared
satisfied
with
his
attentions
then
as
soon
as
she
had
seated
herself
she
asked
him
whether
he
had
been
lately
at
the
arnouxs
not
for
the
past
month
said
frederick
as
for
me
i
met
him
the
day
before
yesterday
he
would
have
even
come
but
he
has
all
sorts
of
troubles
another
lawsuit
i
do
know
what
what
a
queer
man
frederick
added
with
an
air
of
indifference
now
that
i
think
of
it
do
you
still
see
what
that
his
name
is
that
delmar
she
replied
dryly
no
that
all
over
so
it
was
clear
that
there
had
been
a
rupture
between
them
frederick
derived
some
hope
from
this
circumstance
they
descended
the
quartier
bréda
at
an
easy
pace
as
it
happened
to
be
sunday
the
streets
were
deserted
and
some
citizens
faces
presented
themselves
at
the
windows
the
carriage
went
on
more
rapidly
the
noise
of
wheels
made
the
turn
round
the
leather
of
the
hood
which
had
slid
down
was
glittering
the
doubled
himself
up
and
the
two
havanese
beside
one
another
seemed
like
two
ermine
muffs
laid
on
the
cushions
frederick
let
himself
jog
up
and
down
with
the
rocking
of
the
the
maréchale
turned
her
head
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
with
a
smile
on
her
face
her
straw
hat
of
colour
was
trimmed
with
black
lace
the
hood
of
her
bournous
floated
in
the
wind
and
she
sheltered
herself
from
the
rays
of
the
sun
under
a
parasol
of
lilac
satin
pointed
at
the
top
like
a
pagoda
what
loves
of
little
fingers
said
frederick
softly
taking
her
other
hand
her
left
being
adorned
with
a
gold
bracelet
in
the
form
of
a
i
say
that
pretty
where
did
it
come
from
oh
i
had
it
a
long
time
said
the
maréchale
the
young
man
did
not
challenge
this
hypocritical
answer
in
any
way
he
preferred
to
profit
by
the
circumstance
and
still
keeping
hold
of
the
wrist
he
pressed
his
lips
on
it
between
the
glove
and
the
cuff
stop
people
will
see
us
pooh
what
does
it
signify
after
passing
by
the
place
de
la
concorde
they
drove
along
the
quai
de
la
conférence
and
the
quai
de
billy
where
might
be
noticed
a
cedar
in
a
garden
rosanette
believed
that
lebanon
was
situated
in
china
she
laughed
herself
at
her
own
ignorance
and
asked
frederick
to
give
her
lessons
in
geography
then
leaving
the
trocadéro
at
the
right
they
crossed
the
pont
de
jéna
and
drew
up
at
length
in
the
middle
of
the
champ
de
mars
near
some
other
vehicles
already
drawn
up
in
the
hippodrome
the
grass
hillocks
were
covered
with
common
people
some
spectators
might
be
seen
on
the
balcony
of
the
military
school
and
the
two
pavilions
outside
the
the
two
galleries
contained
within
its
enclosure
and
a
third
in
front
of
that
of
the
king
were
filled
with
a
fashionably
dressed
crowd
whose
deportment
showed
their
regard
for
this
as
yet
novel
form
of
amusement
the
public
around
the
course
more
select
at
this
period
had
a
less
vulgar
aspect
it
was
the
era
of
velvet
collars
and
white
gloves
the
ladies
attired
in
showy
colours
displayed
gowns
with
long
waists
and
seated
on
the
tiers
of
the
stands
they
formed
so
to
speak
immense
groups
of
flowers
spotted
here
and
there
with
black
by
the
men
costumes
but
every
glance
was
directed
towards
the
celebrated
algerian
who
sat
impassive
between
two
staff
officers
in
one
of
the
private
galleries
that
of
the
jockey
club
contained
none
but
gentlemen
the
more
enthusiastic
portion
of
the
throng
were
seated
underneath
close
to
the
track
protected
by
two
lines
of
sticks
which
supported
ropes
in
the
immense
oval
described
by
this
passage
were
shaking
their
rattles
others
were
selling
programmes
of
the
races
others
were
hawking
cigars
with
loud
cries
on
every
side
there
was
a
great
murmur
the
municipal
guards
passed
to
and
fro
a
bell
hung
from
a
post
covered
with
figures
began
ringing
five
horses
appeared
and
the
spectators
in
the
galleries
resumed
their
seats
meanwhile
big
clouds
touched
with
their
winding
outlines
the
tops
of
the
elms
opposite
rosanette
was
afraid
that
it
was
going
to
rain
i
have
umbrellas
said
frederick
and
everything
that
we
need
to
afford
ourselves
diversion
he
added
lifting
up
the
chest
in
which
there
was
a
stock
of
provisions
in
a
basket
bravo
we
understand
each
other
and
we
understand
each
other
still
better
shall
we
not
that
may
be
she
said
colouring
the
jockeys
in
silk
jackets
were
trying
to
draw
up
their
horses
in
order
and
were
holding
them
back
with
both
hands
somebody
lowered
a
red
flag
then
the
entire
five
bent
over
the
bristling
manes
and
off
they
started
at
first
they
remained
pressed
close
to
each
other
in
a
single
mass
this
presently
stretched
out
and
became
cut
up
the
jockey
in
the
yellow
jacket
was
near
falling
in
the
middle
of
the
first
round
for
a
long
time
it
was
uncertain
whether
filly
or
tibi
should
take
the
lead
then
tom
pouce
appeared
in
front
but
clubstick
who
had
been
in
the
rear
since
the
start
came
up
with
the
others
and
outstripped
them
so
that
he
was
the
first
to
reach
the
beating
sir
charles
by
two
lengths
it
was
a
surprise
there
was
a
shout
of
applause
the
planks
shook
with
the
stamping
of
feet
we
are
amusing
ourselves
said
the
maréchale
i
love
you
darling
frederick
no
longer
doubted
that
his
happiness
was
secure
last
words
were
a
confirmation
of
it
a
hundred
paces
away
from
him
in
a
cabriolet
a
lady
could
be
seen
she
stretched
her
head
out
of
the
and
then
quickly
drew
it
in
again
this
movement
was
repeated
several
times
frederick
could
not
distinguish
her
face
he
had
a
strong
suspicion
however
that
it
was
madame
arnoux
and
yet
this
seemed
impossible
why
should
she
have
come
there
he
stepped
out
of
his
own
vehicle
on
the
pretence
of
strolling
into
the
you
are
not
very
gallant
said
rosanette
he
paid
no
heed
to
her
and
went
on
the
cabriolet
turning
back
broke
into
a
trot
frederick
at
the
same
moment
found
himself
by
cisy
my
dear
boy
how
are
you
going
on
hussonnet
is
over
there
are
you
listening
to
me
frederick
tried
to
shake
him
off
in
order
to
get
up
with
the
cabriolet
the
maréchale
beckoned
to
him
to
come
round
to
her
cisy
perceived
her
and
obstinately
persisted
in
bidding
her
since
the
termination
of
the
regular
period
of
mourning
for
his
grandmother
he
had
realised
his
ideal
and
succeeded
in
getting
the
proper
stamp
a
scotch
plaid
waistcoat
a
short
coat
large
bows
over
the
pumps
and
an
stuck
in
the
ribbon
of
his
hat
nothing
in
fact
was
wanting
to
produce
what
he
described
himself
as
his
a
characterised
by
anglomania
and
the
swagger
of
the
musketeer
he
began
by
finding
fault
with
the
champ
de
mars
which
he
referred
to
as
an
execrable
turf
then
spoke
of
the
chantilly
races
and
the
droll
things
that
had
occurred
there
swore
that
he
could
drink
a
dozen
glasses
of
champagne
while
the
clock
was
striking
the
midnight
hour
offered
to
make
a
bet
with
the
maréchale
softly
caressed
her
two
lapdogs
and
leaning
against
the
on
one
elbow
he
kept
talking
nonsense
with
the
handle
of
his
in
his
mouth
his
legs
wide
apart
and
his
back
stretched
out
frederick
standing
beside
him
was
smoking
while
endeavouring
to
make
out
what
had
become
of
the
cabriolet
the
bell
having
rung
cisy
took
himself
off
to
the
great
delight
of
rosanette
who
said
he
had
been
boring
her
to
death
the
second
race
had
nothing
special
about
it
neither
had
the
third
save
that
a
man
was
thrown
over
the
shaft
of
a
cart
while
it
was
taking
place
the
fourth
in
which
eight
horses
contested
the
city
stakes
was
more
interesting
the
spectators
in
the
gallery
had
clambered
to
the
top
of
their
seats
the
others
standing
up
in
the
vehicles
followed
with
in
their
hands
the
movements
of
the
jockeys
they
could
be
seen
starting
out
like
red
yellow
white
or
blue
spots
across
the
entire
space
occupied
by
the
crowd
that
had
gathered
around
the
ring
of
the
hippodrome
at
a
distance
their
speed
did
not
appear
to
be
very
great
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
champ
de
mars
they
seemed
even
to
be
slackening
their
pace
and
to
be
merely
slipping
along
in
such
a
way
that
the
horses
bellies
touched
the
ground
without
their
outstretched
legs
bending
at
all
but
coming
back
at
a
more
rapid
stride
they
looked
bigger
they
cut
the
air
in
their
wild
gallop
the
sun
rays
quivered
pebbles
went
flying
about
under
their
hoofs
the
wind
blowing
out
the
jockeys
jackets
made
them
flutter
like
veils
each
of
them
lashed
the
animal
he
rode
with
great
blows
of
his
whip
in
order
to
reach
the
that
was
the
goal
they
aimed
at
one
swept
away
the
figures
another
was
hoisted
off
his
saddle
and
in
the
midst
of
a
burst
of
applause
the
victorious
horse
dragged
his
feet
to
the
all
covered
with
sweat
his
knees
stiffened
his
neck
and
shoulders
bent
down
while
his
rider
looking
as
if
he
were
expiring
in
his
saddle
clung
to
the
animal
flanks
the
final
start
was
retarded
by
a
dispute
which
had
arisen
the
crowd
getting
tired
began
to
scatter
groups
of
men
were
chatting
at
the
lower
end
of
each
gallery
the
talk
was
of
a
description
some
fashionable
ladies
left
scandalised
by
seeing
fast
women
in
their
immediate
vicinity
there
were
also
some
specimens
of
the
ladies
who
appeared
at
public
balls
some
actresses
of
the
boulevards
and
it
was
not
the
portion
of
them
that
got
the
most
appreciation
the
elderly
georgine
aubert
she
whom
a
writer
of
vaudevilles
called
the
louis
xi
of
her
profession
horribly
painted
and
giving
vent
every
now
and
then
to
a
laugh
resembling
a
grunt
remained
reclining
at
full
length
in
her
big
calash
covered
with
a
sable
as
if
it
were
midwinter
madame
de
remoussat
who
had
become
fashionable
by
means
of
a
notorious
trial
in
which
she
figured
sat
enthroned
on
the
seat
of
a
brake
in
company
with
some
americans
and
thérèse
bachelu
with
her
look
of
a
gothic
virgin
filled
with
her
dozen
furbelows
the
interior
of
a
trap
which
had
in
place
of
an
apron
a
filled
with
roses
the
maréchale
was
jealous
of
these
magnificent
displays
in
order
to
attract
attention
she
began
to
make
vehement
gestures
and
to
speak
in
a
very
loud
voice
gentlemen
recognised
her
and
bowed
to
her
she
returned
their
salutations
while
telling
frederick
their
names
they
were
all
counts
viscounts
dukes
and
marquises
and
carried
a
high
head
for
in
all
eyes
he
could
read
a
certain
respect
for
his
good
fortune
cisy
had
a
no
less
happy
air
in
the
midst
of
the
circle
of
mature
men
that
surrounded
them
their
faces
wore
cynical
smiles
above
their
cravats
as
if
they
were
laughing
at
him
at
length
he
gave
a
tap
in
the
hand
of
the
oldest
of
them
and
made
his
way
towards
the
maréchale
she
was
eating
with
an
affectation
of
gluttony
a
slice
of
de
foie
frederick
in
order
to
make
himself
agreeable
to
her
followed
her
example
with
a
bottle
of
wine
on
his
knees
the
cabriolet
reappeared
it
madame
arnoux
her
face
was
startlingly
pale
give
me
some
champagne
said
rosanette
and
lifting
up
her
glass
full
to
the
brim
as
high
as
possible
she
exclaimed
look
over
there
look
at
my
protector
wife
one
of
the
virtuous
women
there
was
a
great
burst
of
laughter
all
round
her
and
the
cabriolet
disappeared
from
view
frederick
tugged
impatiently
at
her
dress
and
was
on
the
point
of
flying
into
a
passion
but
cisy
was
there
in
the
same
attitude
as
before
and
with
increased
assurance
he
invited
rosanette
to
dine
with
him
that
very
evening
impossible
she
replied
we
going
together
to
the
café
anglais
frederick
as
if
he
had
heard
nothing
remained
silent
and
cisy
quitted
the
maréchale
with
a
look
of
disappointment
on
his
face
while
he
had
been
talking
to
her
at
the
door
of
the
carriage
hussonnet
presented
himself
at
the
opposite
side
and
catching
the
words
café
anglais
it
a
nice
establishment
suppose
we
had
a
pick
there
eh
just
as
you
like
said
frederick
who
sunk
down
in
the
corner
of
the
berlin
was
gazing
at
the
horizon
as
the
cabriolet
vanished
from
his
sight
feeling
that
an
irreparable
thing
had
happened
and
that
there
was
an
end
of
his
great
love
and
the
other
woman
was
there
beside
him
the
gay
and
easy
love
but
worn
out
full
of
conflicting
desires
and
no
longer
even
knowing
what
he
wanted
he
was
possessed
by
a
feeling
of
infinite
sadness
a
longing
to
die
a
great
noise
of
footsteps
and
of
voices
made
him
raise
his
head
the
little
ragamuffins
assembled
round
the
track
sprang
over
the
ropes
and
came
to
stare
at
the
galleries
thereupon
their
occupants
rose
to
go
a
few
drops
of
rain
began
to
fall
the
crush
of
vehicles
increased
and
hussonnet
got
lost
in
it
well
so
much
the
better
said
frederick
we
like
to
be
alone
better
do
we
said
the
maréchale
as
she
placed
her
hand
in
his
then
there
swept
past
him
with
a
glitter
of
copper
and
steel
a
magnificent
landau
to
which
were
yoked
four
horses
driven
in
the
daumont
style
by
two
jockeys
in
velvet
vests
with
gold
fringes
madame
dambreuse
was
by
her
husband
side
and
martinon
was
on
the
other
seat
facing
them
all
three
of
them
gazed
at
frederick
in
astonishment
they
have
recognised
me
said
he
to
himself
rosanette
wished
to
stop
in
order
to
get
a
better
view
of
the
people
driving
away
from
the
course
madame
arnoux
might
again
make
her
appearance
he
called
out
to
the
postilion
go
on
go
on
forward
and
the
berlin
dashed
towards
the
in
the
midst
of
the
other
vehicles
calashes
britzkas
wurths
tandems
tilburies
tilted
carts
with
leather
curtains
in
which
workmen
in
a
jovial
mood
were
singing
or
chaises
driven
by
fathers
of
families
in
victorias
crammed
with
people
some
young
fellows
seated
on
the
others
feet
let
their
legs
both
hang
down
large
broughams
which
had
their
seats
lined
with
cloth
carried
dowagers
fast
asleep
or
else
a
splendid
machine
passed
with
a
seat
as
simple
and
coquettish
as
a
dandy
black
coat
the
shower
grew
heavier
umbrellas
parasols
and
mackintoshes
were
put
into
requisition
people
cried
out
at
some
distance
away
are
you
quite
well
yes
no
and
the
faces
succeeded
each
other
with
the
rapidity
of
chinese
shadows
frederick
and
rosanette
did
not
say
a
word
to
each
other
feeling
a
sort
of
dizziness
at
seeing
all
these
wheels
continually
revolving
close
to
them
at
times
the
rows
of
carriages
too
closely
pressed
together
stopped
all
at
the
same
time
in
several
lines
then
they
remained
side
by
side
and
their
occupants
scanned
one
another
over
the
sides
of
panels
adorned
with
indifferent
glances
were
cast
on
the
crowd
eyes
full
of
envy
gleamed
from
the
interiors
of
depreciatory
smiles
responded
to
the
haughty
manner
in
which
some
people
carried
their
heads
mouths
gaping
wide
expressed
idiotic
admiration
and
here
and
there
some
lounger
in
the
middle
of
the
road
fell
back
with
a
bound
in
order
to
avoid
a
rider
who
had
been
galloping
through
the
midst
of
the
vehicles
and
had
succeeded
in
getting
away
from
them
then
everything
set
itself
in
motion
once
more
the
coachmen
let
go
the
reins
and
lowered
their
long
whips
the
horses
excited
shook
their
and
flung
foam
around
them
and
the
cruppers
and
the
harness
getting
moist
were
smoking
with
the
watery
evaporation
through
which
struggled
the
rays
of
the
sinking
sun
passing
under
the
arc
de
triomphe
there
stretched
out
at
the
height
of
a
man
a
reddish
light
which
shed
a
glittering
lustre
on
the
naves
of
the
wheels
the
handles
of
the
the
ends
of
the
shafts
and
the
rings
of
the
and
on
the
two
sides
of
the
great
avenue
like
a
river
in
which
manes
garments
and
human
heads
were
undulating
the
trees
all
glittering
with
rain
rose
up
like
two
green
walls
the
blue
of
the
sky
overhead
reappearing
in
certain
places
had
the
soft
hue
of
satin
then
frederick
recalled
the
days
already
far
away
when
he
yearned
for
the
inexpressible
happiness
of
finding
himself
in
one
of
these
carriages
by
the
side
of
one
of
these
women
he
had
attained
to
this
bliss
and
yet
he
was
not
thereby
one
jot
the
happier
the
rain
had
ceased
falling
the
pedestrians
who
had
sought
shelter
between
the
columns
of
the
public
storerooms
took
their
departure
persons
who
had
been
walking
along
the
rue
royale
went
up
again
towards
the
boulevard
in
front
of
the
residence
of
the
minister
of
foreign
affairs
a
group
of
boobies
had
taken
up
their
posts
on
the
steps
when
it
had
got
up
as
high
as
the
chinese
baths
as
there
were
holes
in
the
pavement
the
berlin
slackened
its
pace
a
man
in
a
paletot
was
walking
on
the
edge
of
the
footpath
a
splash
spurting
out
from
under
the
springs
showed
itself
on
his
back
the
man
turned
round
in
a
rage
frederick
grew
pale
he
had
recognised
deslauriers
at
the
door
of
the
café
anglais
he
sent
away
the
carriage
rosanette
had
gone
in
before
him
while
he
was
paying
the
postilion
he
found
her
subsequently
on
the
stairs
chatting
with
a
gentleman
frederick
took
her
arm
but
in
the
lobby
a
second
gentleman
stopped
her
go
on
said
she
i
am
at
your
service
and
he
entered
the
private
room
alone
through
the
two
open
windows
people
could
be
seen
at
the
casements
of
the
other
houses
opposite
large
watery
masses
were
quivering
on
the
pavement
as
it
began
to
dry
and
a
magnolia
placed
on
the
side
of
a
balcony
shed
a
perfume
through
the
apartment
this
fragrance
and
freshness
had
a
relaxing
effect
on
his
nerves
he
sank
down
on
the
red
divan
underneath
the
glass
the
maréchale
here
entered
the
room
and
kissing
him
on
the
forehead
poor
pet
there
something
annoying
you
perhaps
so
was
his
reply
you
are
not
alone
take
heart
which
was
as
much
as
to
say
let
us
each
forget
our
own
concerns
in
a
bliss
which
we
shall
enjoy
in
common
then
she
placed
the
petal
of
a
flower
between
her
lips
and
extended
it
towards
him
so
that
he
might
peck
at
it
this
movement
full
of
grace
and
of
almost
voluptuous
gentleness
had
a
softening
influence
on
frederick
why
do
you
give
me
pain
said
he
thinking
of
madame
arnoux
i
give
you
pain
and
standing
before
him
she
looked
at
him
with
her
lashes
drawn
close
together
and
her
two
hands
resting
on
his
shoulders
all
his
virtue
all
his
rancour
gave
way
before
the
utter
weakness
of
his
will
he
continued
because
you
wo
love
me
and
he
took
her
on
his
knees
she
gave
way
to
him
he
pressed
his
two
hands
round
her
waist
the
crackling
sound
of
her
silk
dress
inflamed
him
where
are
they
said
hussonnet
voice
in
the
lobby
outside
the
maréchale
arose
abruptly
and
went
across
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
where
she
sat
down
with
her
back
to
the
door
she
ordered
oysters
and
they
seated
themselves
at
table
hussonnet
was
not
amusing
by
dint
of
writing
every
day
on
all
sorts
of
subjects
reading
many
newspapers
listening
to
a
great
number
of
discussions
and
uttering
paradoxes
for
the
purpose
of
dazzling
people
he
had
in
the
end
lost
the
exact
idea
of
things
blinding
himself
with
his
own
feeble
fireworks
the
embarrassments
of
a
life
which
had
formerly
been
frivolous
but
which
was
now
full
of
difficulty
kept
him
in
a
state
of
perpetual
agitation
and
his
impotency
which
he
did
not
wish
to
avow
rendered
him
snappish
and
sarcastic
referring
to
a
new
ballet
entitled
he
gave
a
thorough
to
the
dancing
and
then
when
the
opera
was
in
question
he
attacked
the
italians
now
replaced
by
a
company
of
spanish
actors
as
if
people
had
not
quite
enough
of
castilles
already
frederick
was
shocked
at
this
owing
to
his
romantic
attachment
to
spain
and
with
a
view
to
diverting
the
conversation
into
a
new
channel
he
enquired
about
the
collége
of
france
where
edgar
quinet
and
mickiewicz
had
attended
but
hussonnet
an
admirer
of
de
maistre
declared
himself
on
the
side
of
authority
and
spiritualism
nevertheless
he
had
doubts
about
the
most
facts
contradicted
history
and
disputed
about
things
whose
certainty
could
not
be
questioned
so
that
at
mention
of
the
word
geometry
he
exclaimed
what
fudge
this
geometry
is
all
this
he
intermingled
with
imitations
of
actors
sainville
was
specially
his
model
footnote
this
pun
of
hussonnet
turns
on
the
double
sense
of
the
word
castille
which
not
only
means
a
place
in
spain
but
also
an
translator
frederick
was
quite
bored
by
these
quibbles
in
an
outburst
of
impatience
he
pushed
his
foot
under
the
table
and
pressed
it
on
one
of
the
little
dogs
thereupon
both
animals
began
barking
in
a
horrible
fashion
you
ought
to
get
them
sent
home
said
he
abruptly
rosanette
did
not
know
anyone
to
whom
she
could
intrust
them
then
he
turned
round
to
the
bohemian
look
here
hussonnet
sacrifice
yourself
oh
yes
my
boy
that
would
be
a
very
obliging
act
hussonnet
set
off
without
even
requiring
to
have
an
appeal
made
to
him
in
what
way
could
they
repay
him
for
his
kindness
frederick
did
not
bestow
a
thought
on
it
he
was
even
beginning
to
rejoice
at
finding
himself
alone
with
her
when
a
waiter
entered
madame
somebody
is
asking
for
you
what
again
however
i
must
see
who
it
is
said
rosanette
he
was
thirsting
for
her
he
wanted
her
this
disappearance
seemed
to
him
an
act
of
prevarication
almost
a
piece
of
rudeness
what
then
did
she
mean
was
it
not
enough
to
have
insulted
madame
arnoux
so
much
for
the
latter
all
the
same
now
he
hated
all
women
and
he
felt
the
tears
choking
him
for
his
love
had
been
misunderstood
and
his
desire
eluded
the
maréchale
returned
and
presented
cisy
to
him
i
have
invited
monsieur
i
have
done
right
have
i
not
how
is
that
oh
certainly
frederick
with
the
smile
of
a
criminal
about
to
be
executed
beckoned
to
the
gentleman
to
take
a
seat
the
maréchale
began
to
run
her
eye
through
the
bill
of
fare
stopping
at
every
fantastic
name
suppose
we
eat
a
turban
of
rabbits
la
and
a
pudding
la
footnote
the
word
orléans
means
light
woollen
cloth
and
possibly
cisy
pun
might
be
rendered
oh
no
cloth
pudding
translator
oh
not
orléans
pray
exclaimed
cisy
who
was
a
legitimist
and
thought
of
making
a
pun
would
you
prefer
a
turbot
chambord
she
next
asked
frederick
was
disgusted
with
this
display
of
politeness
the
maréchale
made
up
her
mind
to
order
a
simple
fillet
of
beef
cut
up
into
steaks
some
crayfishes
truffles
a
salad
and
vanilla
ices
we
see
what
next
go
on
for
the
present
ah
i
was
forgetting
bring
me
a
sausage
not
with
garlic
and
she
called
the
waiter
young
man
struck
her
glass
with
her
knife
and
flung
up
the
crumbs
of
her
bread
to
the
ceiling
she
wished
to
drink
some
burgundy
immediately
it
is
not
taken
in
the
beginning
said
frederick
this
was
sometimes
done
according
to
the
vicomte
oh
no
never
yes
indeed
i
assure
you
ha
you
see
the
look
with
which
she
accompanied
these
words
meant
this
is
a
rich
man
pay
attention
to
what
he
says
meantime
the
door
was
opening
every
moment
the
waiters
kept
shouting
and
on
an
infernal
piano
in
the
adjoining
room
some
one
was
strumming
a
waltz
then
the
races
led
to
a
discussion
about
horsemanship
and
the
two
rival
systems
cisy
was
upholding
baucher
and
frederick
the
comte
when
rosanette
shrugged
her
shoulders
enough
my
god
he
is
a
better
judge
of
these
things
than
you
are
come
now
she
kept
nibbling
at
a
pomegranate
with
her
elbow
resting
on
the
table
the
of
the
candelabrum
in
front
of
her
were
flickering
in
the
wind
this
white
light
penetrated
her
skin
with
tones
gave
a
pink
hue
to
her
lids
and
made
her
eyeballs
glitter
the
red
colour
of
the
fruit
blended
with
the
purple
of
her
lips
her
thin
nostrils
heaved
and
there
was
about
her
entire
person
an
air
of
insolence
intoxication
and
recklessness
that
exasperated
frederick
and
yet
filled
his
heart
with
wild
desires
then
she
asked
in
a
calm
voice
who
owned
that
big
landau
with
livery
cisy
replied
that
it
was
the
comtesse
dambreuse
they
very
rich
are
they
oh
very
rich
although
madame
dambreuse
who
was
merely
a
mademoiselle
boutron
and
the
daughter
of
a
prefect
had
a
very
modest
fortune
her
husband
on
the
other
hand
must
have
inherited
several
estates
cisy
enumerated
them
as
he
visited
the
dambreuses
he
knew
their
family
history
frederick
in
order
to
make
himself
disagreeable
to
the
other
took
a
pleasure
in
contradicting
him
he
maintained
that
madame
maiden
name
was
de
boutron
which
proved
that
she
was
of
a
noble
family
no
matter
i
like
to
have
her
equipage
said
the
maréchale
throwing
herself
back
on
the
armchair
and
the
sleeve
of
her
dress
slipping
up
a
little
showed
on
her
left
wrist
a
bracelet
adorned
with
three
opals
frederick
noticed
it
look
here
why
all
three
looked
into
one
another
faces
and
reddened
the
door
was
cautiously
the
brim
of
a
hat
could
be
seen
and
then
hussonnet
profile
exhibited
itself
pray
excuse
me
if
i
disturb
the
lovers
but
he
stopped
astonished
at
seeing
cisy
and
that
cisy
had
taken
his
own
seat
another
cover
was
brought
and
as
he
was
very
hungry
he
snatched
up
at
random
from
what
remained
of
the
dinner
some
meat
which
was
in
a
dish
fruit
out
of
a
basket
and
drank
with
one
hand
while
he
helped
himself
with
the
other
all
the
time
telling
them
the
result
of
his
mission
the
two
had
been
taken
home
nothing
fresh
at
the
house
he
had
found
the
cook
in
the
company
of
a
soldier
a
fictitious
story
which
he
had
especially
invented
for
the
sake
of
effect
the
maréchale
took
down
her
cloak
from
the
frederick
made
a
rush
towards
the
bell
calling
out
to
the
waiter
who
was
some
distance
away
a
carriage
i
have
one
of
my
own
said
the
vicomte
but
monsieur
nevertheless
monsieur
and
they
stared
into
each
other
eyes
both
pale
and
their
hands
trembling
at
last
the
maréchale
took
cisy
arm
and
pointing
towards
the
bohemian
seated
at
the
table
pray
mind
him
he
choking
himself
i
would
care
to
let
his
devotion
to
my
pugs
be
the
cause
of
his
death
the
door
closed
behind
him
well
said
hussonnet
well
what
i
thought
what
did
you
think
were
you
not
he
completed
the
sentence
with
a
gesture
oh
no
never
in
all
my
life
hussonnet
did
not
press
the
matter
further
he
had
an
object
in
inviting
himself
to
dinner
his
journal
which
was
no
longer
called
but
with
this
epigraph
gunners
to
your
cannons
not
being
at
all
in
a
flourishing
condition
he
had
a
mind
to
change
it
into
a
weekly
review
conducted
by
himself
without
any
assistance
from
deslauriers
he
again
referred
to
the
old
project
and
explained
his
latest
plan
footnote
frederick
probably
not
understanding
what
he
was
talking
about
replied
with
some
vague
words
hussonnet
snatched
up
several
cigars
from
the
tables
said
old
chap
and
disappeared
frederick
called
for
the
bill
it
had
a
long
list
of
items
and
the
waiter
with
his
napkin
under
his
arm
was
expecting
to
be
paid
by
frederick
when
another
a
individual
who
resembled
martinon
came
and
said
to
him
beg
pardon
they
forgot
at
the
bar
to
add
in
the
charge
for
the
cab
what
cab
the
cab
the
gentleman
took
a
short
time
ago
for
the
little
dogs
and
the
waiter
put
on
a
look
of
gravity
as
if
he
pitied
the
poor
young
man
frederick
felt
inclined
to
box
the
fellow
ears
he
gave
the
waiter
the
twenty
francs
change
as
a
thanks
monseigneur
said
the
man
with
the
napkin
bowing
low
