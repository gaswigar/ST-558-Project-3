note
the
following
narrative
is
based
upon
an
episode
taken
from
that
much
neglected
portion
of
our
history
the
era
of
the
american
fur
trade
my
interest
in
that
period
may
be
said
to
have
begun
at
the
age
of
six
when
clinging
to
the
forefinger
of
my
father
i
discovered
the
missouri
river
from
a
bluff
top
at
kansas
city
it
was
flood
time
and
the
impression
i
received
was
deep
and
lasting
even
now
i
can
not
think
of
that
stream
without
a
thrill
of
awe
and
something
of
the
reverence
one
feels
for
mighty
things
it
was
for
me
what
the
sea
must
have
been
to
the
greek
boys
of
antiquity
and
as
those
ancient
boys
must
have
been
eager
to
hear
of
perils
nobly
encountered
on
the
deep
and
in
the
lands
adjacent
so
was
i
eager
to
learn
of
the
heroes
who
had
travelled
my
river
as
an
imperial
road
nor
was
i
disappointed
in
what
i
learned
of
them
for
they
seemed
to
me
in
every
way
equal
to
the
heroes
of
old
i
came
to
think
of
them
with
a
sense
of
personal
ownership
for
any
one
of
many
of
them
might
have
been
my
so
a
little
of
their
purple
fell
on
me
as
i
grew
older
and
came
to
possess
more
of
my
inheritance
i
began
to
see
that
what
had
enthralled
me
was
in
fact
of
the
stuff
of
sagas
a
genuine
epic
cycle
in
the
rough
furthermore
i
realized
that
this
raw
material
had
been
undergoing
a
process
of
digestion
in
my
consciousness
corresponding
in
a
way
to
the
process
of
infinite
repetition
and
fond
elaboration
which
as
certain
scholars
tell
us
foreran
the
heroic
narratives
of
old
time
i
decided
that
some
day
i
would
begin
to
tell
these
hero
tales
in
verse
and
in
as
a
preparation
for
what
i
had
in
mind
i
descended
the
missouri
in
an
open
boat
and
also
ascended
the
yellowstone
for
a
considerable
distance
on
the
upper
river
the
country
was
practically
unchanged
and
for
one
familiar
with
what
had
taken
place
there
it
was
no
difficult
feat
of
the
imagination
to
revive
the
details
of
that
men
the
trails
the
boats
the
trading
posts
where
veritable
satraps
once
ruled
under
the
sway
of
the
american
fur
company
the
hugh
glass
episode
is
to
be
found
in
chittenden
s
history
of
the
american
fur
trade
where
it
is
quoted
from
its
three
printed
sources
the
sage
s
scenes
in
the
rocky
mountains
and
cooke
s
scenes
in
the
united
states
the
present
narrative
begins
after
that
military
fiasco
known
as
the
leavenworth
campaign
against
the
aricaras
which
took
place
at

introduction
if
the
average
student
of
western
american
history
in
our
schools
were
asked
to
recall
those
names
which
loom
large
for
him
during
the
four
decades
from
the
purchase
of
the
louisiana
territory
to
the
coming
of
the
settlers
he
would
doubtless
think
of
lewis
and
clark
lieutenant
pike
major
long
and
general
frémont
with
perhaps
one
or
two
others
that
is
to
say
the
average
student
of
western
history
is
familiar
with
the
names
of
official
explorers
and
but
for
their
exploits
those
forty
wonderful
years
would
seem
to
him
little
more
than
a
lapse
of
empty
time
in
a
vast
region
waiting
for
the
westering
white
man
it
is
true
that
the
deeds
of
those
above
named
were
important
the
journey
of
lewis
and
clark
from
louis
to
the
mouth
of
the
columbia
and
back
again
has
immense
significance
in
the
story
of
our
national
life
and
it
was
truly
a
magnificent
adventure
to
use
the
phrase
of
emerson
hough
pike
holds
and
deserves
a
high
place
for
his
explorations
in
the
southwest
long
s
contribution
to
the
early
knowledge
of
the
west
was
considerable
and
frémont
s
expeditions
served
at
least
to
awaken
the
popular
eastern
mind
to
the
great
possibilities
of
the
region
frémont
s
reputation
however
is
out
of
all
proportion
to
his
real
accomplishment
for
the
trails
he
travelled
were
well
known
to
white
men
long
before
he
ventured
into
the
wilderness
in
this
connection
major
chittenden
one
of
the
foremost
authorities
on
the
subject
tells
us
that
there
never
has
been
a
time
until
very
recently
when
the
geography
of
the
west
was
so
thoroughly
understood
as
it
was
by
the
trader
and
trapper
from
to
when
lewis
and
clark
were
descending
the
missouri
river
in
the
summer
of
on
their
return
from
the
mouth
of
the
columbia
they
met
bands
of
traders
pushing
on
toward
the
country
from
whence
the
explorers
had
just
come
these
were
the
vanguard
of
the
real
history
makers
of
the
early
west
it
was
such
men
as
these
who
during
the
next
generation
as
chittenden
says
first
explored
and
established
the
routes
of
travel
which
are
now
and
always
will
be
the
avenues
of
commerce
in
that
the
period
that
followed
the
return
of
lewis
and
clark
was
one
of
the
most
enthralling
in
the
entire
story
of
the
human
race
and
yet
the
very
names
of
its
principal
heroes
are
practically
unknown
except
to
specialists
in
western
history
the
stories
of
their
exploits
have
not
yet
reached
our
schools
and
are
to
be
found
for
the
most
part
hidden
away
in
the
collections
of
state
historical
societies
and
in
contemporary
journals
and
books
of
travel
long
since
out
of
print
the
mormon
emigration
the
mexican
war
the
gold
rush
to
california
and
the
oregon
question
filled
the
popular
imagination
during
the
early
years
of
the
west
and
thus
an
important
phase
of
our
national
development
was
overlooked
and
forgotten
nevertheless
it
remains
true
that
the
story
of
the
west
during
the
first
four
decades
of
the
nineteenth
century
is
the
story
of
the
wandering
bands
of
trappers
and
traders
who
explored
the
wilderness
in
search
of
furs
from
the
british
boundary
to
mexico
and
from
the
missouri
to
the
pacific
history
as
written
in
the
past
has
been
too
much
a
chronological
record
of
official
governmental
acts
too
little
an
intimate
account
of
the
lives
of
the
people
themselves
doubtless
the
democratic
spirit
that
now
seems
to
be
sweeping
the
world
will
if
it
continues
to
spread
revolutionize
our
whole
conception
of
history
bringing
us
to
realize
that
the
glory
of
the
race
is
not
the
glory
of
a
chosen
few
but
that
it
radiates
from
the
precious
heroic
stuff
of
common
human
lives
and
that
view
i
am
proud
to
say
is
quite
in
keeping
with
our
dearest
national
traditions
now
the
fur
trade
on
the
missouri
river
dates
well
back
into
the
eighteenth
century
and
at
the
time
of
the
revolutionary
war
parties
of
trappers
had
already
ascended
as
far
north
as
the
big
bend
in
the
present
state
of
south
dakota
but
it
was
not
until
after
the
return
of
lewis
and
clark
from
the
northwest
and
of
lieutenant
pike
from
the
southwest
that
the
great
era
of
the
fur
trade
began
in
the
spanish
trader
manuel
lisa
ascended
the
missouri
and
the
yellowstone
to
the
mouth
of
the
big
horn
where
he
erected
a
trading
post
returning
to
louis
the
next
year
he
became
the
leading
spirit
in
the
st
louis
missouri
fur
company
the
troubled
career
of
which
during
the
succeeding
fifteen
years
was
rich
in
the
stuff
of
which
epics
are
made
major
andrew
henry
who
appears
in
the
song
of
hugh
glass
as
leader
of
the
westbound
expedition
from
the
mouth
of
the
grand
river
was
a
member
of
that
company
ascending
the
missouri
to
the
three
forks
in
the
summer
of
driven
thence
by
the
blackfeet
he
crossed
the
great
divide
and
built
a
post
on
what
has
since
been
called
henry

fork
of
the
snake
river
thus
being
the
first
american
trader
to
operate
on
the
pacific
side
of
the
rockies
in
the
spring
of
the
overland
astorians
under
the
command
of

bound
for
the
mouth
of
the
columbia
where
they
expected
to
join
forces
with
a
sea
expedition
that
had
set
sail
from
new
york
during
the
previous
autumn
for
the
long
and
hazardous
voyage
around
cape
horn
this
is
the
only
widely
known
expedition
in
the
whole
history
of
the
fur
trade
thanks
to
washington
irving
whose
account
of
it
is
an
american
classic
during
the
war
of
the
fur
trade
on
the
missouri
declined
and
though
in
the
year
five
companies
of
some
importance
were
operating
from
louis
none
of
these
was
doing
a
profitable
business
the
revival
of
the
trade
which
ushered
in
the
great
epic
period
of
our
national
development
may
be
dated
from
march
when
the
following
advertisement
appeared
in
the
of
louis
to
enterprising
young
men
the
subscriber
wishes
to
engage
one
hundred
young
men
to
ascend
the
missouri
river
to
its
source
there
to
be
employed
for
one
two
or
three
years
for
particulars
enquire
of
major
andrew
henry
near
the
lead
mines
in
the
county
of
washington
who
will
ascend
with
and
command
the
party
or
of
the
subscriber
near
louis
signed
william
ashley
major
henry
has
already
been
mentioned
as
a
veteran
trader
of
the
upper
country
ashley
who
was
at
that
time
general
of
the
missouri
militia
and
lieutenant
governor
of
the
recently
admitted
state
was
about
to
make
his
first
trip
into
the
wilderness
setting
out
in
the
spring
of
major
henry
with
his
one
hundred
enterprising
young
men
some
of
whom
were
young
only
in
spirit
ascended
to
the
mouth
of
the
yellowstone
this
was
before
the
era
of
the
missouri
river
steamboat
and
the
two
keelboats
that
bore
the
trading
stock
and
supplies
of
the
party
were
cordelled
that
is
to
say
pulled
by
general
ashley
accompanied
the
expedition
returning
to
louis
in
the
fall
early
in
the
spring
of
he
started
north
again
with
a
second
band
of
one
hundred
men
stopping
to
trade
for
horses
at
the
ree
villages
near
the
mouth
of
the
grand
he
was
attacked
by
that
most
treacherous
of
the
missouri
river
tribes
received
a
sound
drubbing
lost
most
of
his
horses
and
was
compelled
to
drop
down
stream
to
await
reënforcements
it
was
in
this
battle
that
old
hugh
glass
received
his
hip
wound
jedediah
smith
who
was
a
member
of
the
defeated
party
and
who
had
fought
with
conspicuous
bravery
volunteered
to
carry
the
news
of
disaster
to
henry
at
the
mouth
of
the
yellowstone
he
was
then
but
years
old
yet
during
the
next
six
years
he
was
destined
to
discover
and
explore
the
central
and
southwestern
routes
to
the
achievement
of
equal
importance
with
that
of
lewis
and
clark
and
performed
under
much
greater
difficulties
immediately
upon
the
arrival
of
smith
at
the
mouth
of
the
yellowstone
henry
with
most
of
his
band
started
south
to
the
relief
of
ashley
in
the
meanwhile
ashley
had
apprised
the
indian
agent
and
military
authorities
at
fort
atkinson
of
his
rough
treatment
and
colonel
leavenworth
started
north
with
men
intent
upon
chastising
the
rees
and
making
the
missouri
river
safe
for
american
traders
the
campaign
that
followed
in
which
the
whites
were
aided
by
a
band
of
sioux
was
in
some
important
respects
a
fiasco
as
the
opening
lines
of
the
poem
suggest
but
that
does
not
greatly
matter
here
what
does
matter
is
the
fact
that
the
muster
roll
of
the
two
parties
of
ashley
and
henry
then
united
at
the
mouth
of
the
grand
contained
nearly
all
of
the
great
names
in
the
history
of
the
west
from
the
time
of
lewis
and
clark
to
the
coming
of
the
settlers
harrison
clifford
dale
whose
explorations
to
the
pacific
easily
ranks
him
as
the
supreme
authority
on
this
particular
period
has
the
following
to
say
regarding
the
men
the
wanderings
of
this
group
during
the
next
ten
or
fifteen
years
cover
the
entire
west
it
was
the
most
significant
group
of
continental
explorers
ever
brought
after
the
leavenworth
campaign
against
the
rees
major
henry
with
eighty
men
set
out
for
the
mouth
of
the
big
horn
by
way
of
the
grand
river
valley
hugh
glass
acted
as
hunter
for
the
westbound
party
and
it
is
at
this
point
that
the
following
narrative
begins
old
glass
was
not
himself
an
explorer
yet
his
adventures
serve
to
illustrate
the
heroic
temper
of
the
men
who
explored
the
west
as
well
as
the
nature
of
the
difficulties
they
encountered
in
building
the
epic
cycle
of
which
the
song
of
hugh
glass
and
the
song
of
three
friends
are
parts
each
however
being
complete
in
itself
i
am
concerned
with
the
wanderings
of
that
group
of
men
who
were
assembled
for
the
last
time
at
the
mouth
of
the
grand
long
ago
when
i
was
younger
than
most
of
you
who
are
now
about
to
study
the
poem
here
presented
i
dreamed
of
making
those
men
live
again
for
the
young
men
and
women
of
my
country
the
tremendous
mood
of
heroism
that
was
developed
in
our
american
west
during
that
period
is
properly
a
part
of
your
racial
inheritance
and
certainly
no
less
important
a
part
than
the
memory
of
ancient
heroes
indeed
it
can
be
shown
that
those
virginians
pennsylvanians
direct
descendants
in
the
epic
line
of
all
the
heroes
of
our
aryan
race
that
have
been
celebrated
by
the
poets
of
the
past
descendants
of
achilles
and
hector
of
æneas
of
roland
of
sigurd
and
of
the
knights
of
arthur
s
court
they
went
as
in
the
van
of
our
westering
civilization
your
present
is
in
a
great
measure
a
heritage
from
their
past

habit
of
his
tongue
none
knew
the
place
or
season
of
his
birth
slowly
he
woke
to
anger
or
to
mirth
yet
none
laughed
louder
when
the
rare
mood
fell
and
hate
in
him
was
like
a
still
white
hell
a
thing
of
doom
not
lightly
reconciled
what
memory
he
kept
of
wife
or
child
was
never
told
for
when
his
comrades
sat
about
the
evening
fire
with
pipe
and
chat
exchanging
talk
of
home
and
gentler
days
old
hugh
stared
long
upon
the
pictured
blaze
and
what
he
saw
went
upward
in
the
smoke
but
once
as
with
an
inner
lightning
stroke
the
veil
was
rent
and
briefly
men
discerned
what
fires
of
selfless
passion
burned
beneath
the
still
gray
smoldering
of
him
there
was
a
rakehell
lad
called
little
jim
jamie
or
petit
jacques
for
scarce
began
the
downy
beard
to
mark
him
for
a
man
was
he
and
femininely
fair
a
maiden
might
have
coveted
his
hair
that
trapped
the
sunlight
in
its
tangled
skein
so
tardily
outflowered
the
wild
blond
strain
that
gutted
rome
grown
overfat
in
sloth
a
ganymedes
haunted
by
a
goth
was
jamie
when
the
restive
ghost
was
laid
he
seemed
some
child
who
played
at
manliness
mid
all
those
bearded
men
the
sternest
heart
was
drawn
to
jamie
then
but
his
one
mood
ne
er
linked
two
hours
together
to
schedule
jamie
s
way
as
prairie
weather
was
to
get
fact
by
wedding
doubt
and
whim
for
very
lightly
slept
that
ghost
in
him
no
cloudy
brooding
went
before
his
wrath
that
like
a
recked
not
its
path
but
raged
upon
what
happened
in
its
way
some
called
him
brave
who
saw
him
on
that
day
when
ashley
stormed
a
bluff
town
of
the
ree
and
all
save
beardless
jamie
turned
to
flee
for
shelter
from
that
steep
slope
yet
hardly
courage
but
blind
rage
agrope
inspired
the
foolish
deed
twas
then
old
hugh
tore
off
the
gray
mask
and
the
heart
shone
through
for
halting
in
a
dry
draw
the
trappers
rallied
looked
aloft
and
saw
that
travesty
of
war
against
the
sky
out
of
a
breathless
hush
the
old
man
s
cry
leaped
shivering
an
anguished
cry
and
wild
as
of
some
mother
fearing
for
her
child
and
up
the
steep
he
went
with
mighty
bounds
long
afterward
the
story
went
the
rounds
how
old
glass
fought
that
day
with
gun
for
club
grim
as
a
grizzly
fighting
for
a
cub
he
laid
about
him
cleared
the
way
and
so
supported
by
the
firing
from
below
brought
jamie
back
and
when
the
deed
was
done
taking
the
lad
upon
his
knee
my
son
brave
men
are
not
ashamed
to
fear
said
hugh
and
i
ve
a
mind
to
make
a
man
of
you
so
here
s
your
first
acquaintance
with
the
law
whereat
he
spanked
the
lad
with
vigorous
paw
and
having
done
so
limped
away
to
bed
for
wounded
in
the
hip
the
old
man
bled
it
was
a
month
before
he
hobbled
out
and
jamie
like
a
fond
son
hung
about
the
old
man
s
tent
and
waited
upon
him
and
often
would
the
deep
gray
eyes
grow
dim
with
gazing
on
the
boy
and
there
would
as
though
should
waken
out
of
a
wistful
light
across
that
mask
of
gray
and
once
hugh
smiled
his
enigmatic
way
while
poring
long
on
jamie
s
face
and
said
so
with
their
sons
are
women
brought
to
bed
sore
wounded
thus
united
were
the
two
and
some
would
dub
the
old
man
mother
hugh
while
those
in
whom
all
living
waters
sank
to
some
dull
inner
pool
that
teemed
and
stank
with
formless
evil
into
that
morass
gazed
and
saw
darkly
there
as
in
a
glass
the
foul
shape
of
some
weakly
envied
sin
for
each
man
builds
a
world
and
dwells
therein
nor
could
these
know
what
mocking
ghost
of
spring
stirred
hugh
s
gray
world
with
dreams
of
blossoming
that
wooed
no
seed
to
swell
or
bird
to
sing
so
might
a
digit
of
the
moon
dream
back
the
rain
of
some
old
lunar
june
and
ache
through
all
its
craters
to
be
green
little
they
know
what
life
s
one
love
can
mean
who
shrine
it
in
a
bower
of
peace
and
bliss
pang
dwelling
in
a
puckered
cicatrice
more
truly
figures
this
belated
love
yet
very
precious
was
the
hurt
thereof
grievous
to
bear
too
dear
to
cast
away
now
jamie
went
with
hugh
but
who
shall
say
if
twas
a
warm
heart
or
a
wind
of
whim
love
or
the
rover
s
teasing
itch
in
him
moved
jamie
howsoe
er
twas
good
to
see
graybeard
and
goldhair
riding
knee
to
knee
one
age
in
young
adventure
one
who
saw
has
likened
to
a
february
thaw
hugh
s
mellow
mood
those
days
and
truly
so
for
when
the
tempering
southwest
wakes
to
blow
a
phantom
april
over
melting
snow
deep
in
the
north
some
new
white
wrath
is
brewed
out
of
a
inner
solitude
the
old
man
summoned
many
a
stirring
story
lived
grimly
once
but
now
shot
through
with
glory
caught
from
the
wondering
eyes
of
him
who
tales
jaggéd
with
the
bleak
unstudied
word
stark
a
fellow
that
i
knew
so
nameless
went
the
hero
that
was
a
mere
pelt
merchant
as
it
seemed
to
him
yet
trailing
epic
thunders
through
the
dim
whist
world
of
jamie
s
awe
and
so
they
went
one
heart
it
seemed
and
that
heart
well
content
with
tale
and
snatch
of
song
and
careless
laughter
never
before
and
surely
never
after
the
gray
old
man
seemed
nearer
to
his
that
myth
that
somehow
had
to
be
the
truth
yet
could
not
be
convincing
any
more
now
when
the
days
of
travel
numbered
four
and
nearer
drew
the
barrens
with
their
need
on
glass
the
hunter
fell
the
task
to
feed
those
four
score
hungers
when
the
game
should
fail
for
no
young
eye
could
trace
so
dim
a
trail
or
line
the
rifle
sights
with
speed
so
true
nor
might
the
wistful
jamie
go
with
hugh
for
so
hugh
chaffed
my
trick
of
getting
game
might
teach
young
eyes
to
put
old
eyes
to
shame
an
old
dog
never
risks
his
only
wolves
prey
in
packs
the
lion
hunts
alone
is
somewhat
nearer
what
he
should
have
meant
and
so
with
merry
jest
the
old
man
went
and
so
they
parted
at
an
unseen
gate
that
even
then
some
gust
of
moody
fate
clanged
to
betwixt
them
each
a
tale
to
one
in
the
nightmare
scrawl
of
dreams
from
hell
one
in
the
blistering
trail
of
days
venomous
footed
nor
might
it
ere
befall
these
two
should
meet
in
after
days
and
be
graybeard
and
goldhair
riding
knee
to
knee
recounting
with
a
bluff
heroic
scorn
the
haps
of
either
tale
twas
early
morn
when
hugh
went
forth
and
all
day
jamie
rode
with
henry
s
men
while
more
and
more
the
goad
of
eager
youth
sore
fretted
him
and
made
the
dusty
progress
of
the
cavalcade
the
journey
of
a
snail
flock
to
the
moon
until
the
afternoon
turned
many
fingers
he
fled
pricking
his
horse
nor
deigned
to
turn
his
head
at
any
dwindling
voice
of
reprimand
for
somewhere
in
the
breaks
along
the
grand
surely
hugh
waited
with
a
goodly
kill
hoofbeats
of
ghostly
steeds
on
every
hill
mysterious
muffled
hoofs
on
every
bluff
spurred
echo
horses
clattering
up
the
rough
confluent
draws
these
flying
jamie
heard
the
lagging
air
droned
like
the
drowsy
word
of
one
who
tells
weird
stories
late
at
night
half
headlong
joy
and
half
delicious
fright
his
s
pace
outstripped
the
plunging
steed
s
lean
galloper
in
a
wind
of
splendid
deeds
like
hugh
s
he
seemed
unto
himself
until
snorting
above
a
breakneck
hill
the
horse
stopped
jamie
was
aware
of
lonesome
flatlands
fading
skyward
there
beneath
him
and
zigzag
on
either
hand
a
purple
haze
denoted
how
the
grand
forked
wide
twixt
sunset
and
the
polar
star
in
the
stirrups
gazing
far
he
saw
no
hugh
nor
any
moving
thing
save
for
a
welter
of
cawing
crows
about
some
banquet
in
the
further
hush
one
faint
star
set
above
the
fading
blush
of
sunset
saw
the
coming
night
and
grew
with
hand
for
trumpet
jamie
gave
halloo
and
once
again
for
answer
the
horse
neighed
some
vague
mistrust
now
made
him
half
some
formless
dread
that
stirred
beneath
the
will
as
far
as
sleep
from
waking
down
the
hill
in
the
skitter
of
the
shale
the
spurred
horse
floundered
to
the
solid
vale
and
galloped
to
the
northwest
whinnying
the
outstripped
air
moaned
like
a
wounded
thing
but
jamie
gave
the
lie
unto
his
dread
the
old
man
s
camping
out
he
said
somewhere
about
the
forks
as
like
as
not
and
there
ll
be
hunks
of
fresh
meat
steaming
hot
and
fighting
stories
by
a
dying
fire
the
sunset
reared
a
luminous
phantom
spire
that
crumbling
sifted
ashes
down
the
sky
now
pausing
jamie
sent
a
searching
cry
into
the
twilit
brush
and
in
the
vast
denial
of
the
hush
the
champing
of
the
snaffled
horse
seemed
loud
then
startling
as
a
voice
beneath
a
shroud
a
muffled
boom
woke
somewhere
up
the
stream
and
like
vague
thunder
hearkened
in
a
dream
drawled
back
to
silence
now
with
heart
abound
keen
for
the
quarter
of
the
perished
sound
the
lad
spurred
gaily
for
he
doubted
not
his
cry
had
brought
hugh
s
answering
rifle
shot
the
laggard
air
was
like
a
voice
that
sang
and
jamie
half
believed
he
sniffed
the
tang
of
woodsmoke
and
the
smell
of
flesh
when
presently
before
him
like
a
ghost
upstanding
huge
in
twilight
arms
flung
wide
a
gray
form
loomed
the
wise
horse
reared
and
shied
snorting
his
inborn
terror
of
the
bear
and
in
the
whirlwind
of
a
moment
there
betwixt
the
brute
s
hoarse
challenge
and
the
charge
the
lad
beheld
upon
the
grassy
marge
of
a
small
spring
that
bullberries
stooped
to
scan
a
ragged
heap
that
should
have
been
a
man
a
huddled
broken
it
was
hugh
there
was
no
need
for
any
closer
view
as
on
the
instant
of
a
lightning
flash
ere
yet
the
split
gloom
closes
with
a
crash
a
landscape
stares
with
every
circumstance
of
rock
and
so
the
fatal
chance
of
hugh
s
one
shot
made
futile
with
surprise
was
clear
to
jamie
then
before
his
eyes
the
light
whirled
in
a
giddy
dance
of
red
and
doubting
not
the
crumpled
thing
was
dead
that
was
a
friend
with
but
a
skinning
knife
he
would
have
striven
for
the
hated
life
that
triumphed
there
but
with
a
shriek
of
fright
the
mad
horse
bolted
through
the
falling
night
and
jamie
fumbling
at
his
rifle
boot
heard
the
brush
crash
behind
him
where
the
brute
came
headlong
close
upon
the
straining
flanks
but
when
at
length
river
white
rubble
in
the
near
a
swift
thought
swept
the
mind
of
jamie
clear
of
anger
and
of
anguish
for
the
dead
scarce
seemed
the
raging
beast
a
thing
to
dread
but
some
braggart
to
outwit
now
hurling
all
his
strength
upon
the
bit
he
sank
the
spurs
and
with
a
groan
of
pain
the
plunging
horse
obedient
to
the
rein
swerved
sharply
streamward
sliddering
in
the
sand
the
bear
shot
past
and
suddenly
the
grand
loomed
up
beneath
and
rose
to
meet
the
pair
that
rode
a
moment
upon
empty
air
then
smote
the
water
in
a
shower
of
spray
and
when
again
the
slowly
ebbing
day
came
back
to
them
from
nose
to
flank
the
steed
was
scrambling
up
the
further
bank
and
jamie
saw
across
the
narrow
stream
like
some
vague
shape
of
fury
in
a
dream
the
checked
beast
ramping
at
the
water
s
rim
doubt
struggled
with
a
victor
s
thrill
in
him
as
hand
to
buckle
of
the
he
thought
of
dampened
powder
but
beneath
the
rawhide
flap
the
gun
lay
snug
and
dry
then
as
the
horse
wheeled
and
the
mark
went
a
patch
of
shadow
dancing
upon
he
fired
a
sluggish
thunder
trailed
away
the
spreading
lifted
slow
and
there
floundering
in
a
seethe
of
foam
the
bear
hugged
yielding
water
for
the
foe
that
slew
triumphant
jamie
wondered
what
old
hugh
would
think
of
such
a
trick
of
getting
game
young
eyes
indeed
then
that
memory
came
like
a
dull
blade
thrust
back
into
a
wound
one
moment
twas
as
though
the
lad
had
swooned
into
a
waking
there
to
sicken
at
the
ghastly
land
like
some
familiar
face
gone
strange
at
last
but
as
the
hot
tears
came
the
moment
passed
song
snatches
broken
troop
forlorn
like
merry
friends
of
eld
come
back
to
o
erwhelmed
him
there
and
when
the
black
bulk
churned
the
stream
no
longer
jamie
turned
recrossed
the
river
and
rode
back
to
hugh
a
burning
twist
of
valley
grasses
threw
blear
light
about
the
region
of
the
spring
then
jamie
torch
aloft
and
shuddering
knelt
there
beside
his
friend
and
moaned
o
hugh
if
i
had
been
with
been
with
you
we
might
be
laughing
you
are
with
gentle
hand
he
turned
the
hoary
head
that
he
might
see
the
good
gray
face
again
the
torch
burned
out
the
dark
swooped
back
and
then
his
grief
was
frozen
with
an
icy
plunge
in
horror
twas
as
though
a
bloody
sponge
had
wiped
the
pictured
features
from
a
slate
so
pillaged
by
an
army
drunk
with
hate
home
stares
upon
the
homing
refugee
a
red
gout
clung
where
either
brow
should
be
the
haughty
nose
lay
crushed
amid
the
beard
thick
with
slow
ooze
whence
like
a
devil
leered
the
battered
mouth
convulsed
into
a
grin
nor
did
the
darkness
cover
for
therein
some
torch
unsnuffed
with
blear
funereal
flare
still
painted
upon
black
that
alien
stare
to
make
the
lad
more
terribly
alone
then
in
the
gloom
there
rose
a
broken
moan
quick
stifled
and
it
seemed
that
something
stirred
about
the
body
doubting
that
he
heard
the
lad
felt
with
a
panic
catch
of
breath
pale
vagrants
from
the
legendry
of
death
potential
in
the
shadows
there
but
when
the
motion
and
the
moaning
came
again
hope
like
a
shower
at
daybreak
cleansed
the
dark
and
in
the
lad
s
heart
something
like
a
lark
sang
morning
bending
low
he
crooned
hugh
hugh
it
s
t
you
know
m
here
with
as
one
who
in
a
nightmare
strives
to
shouting
across
the
gap
of
some
dim
what
things
assail
him
so
it
seemed
hugh
heard
and
flung
some
unintelligible
word
athwart
the
muffling
distance
of
his
swoon
now
kindled
by
the
yet
unrisen
moon
the
east
went
pale
and
like
a
naked
thing
a
little
wind
ran
vexed
and
shivering
along
the
dusk
till
jamie
shivered
too
and
worried
lest
twere
bitter
cold
where
hugh
hung
clutching
at
the
bleak
raw
edge
of
life
so
jamie
rose
and
with
his
split
wood
and
built
a
fire
nor
did
he
fear
the
staring
face
now
for
he
found
it
dear
with
the
warm
presence
of
a
friend
returned
the
fire
made
cozy
chatter
as
it
burned
and
reared
a
tent
of
light
in
that
lone
place
then
jamie
set
about
to
bathe
the
face
with
water
from
the
spring
oft
crooning
low
it
s
jamie
here
beside
t
you
know
yet
came
no
answer
save
the
labored
breath
of
one
who
wrestled
mightily
with
death
where
watched
no
referee
to
call
the
foul
the
moon
now
cleared
the
world
s
end
and
the
owl
gave
voice
unto
the
wizardry
of
light
while
in
some
chancel
of
the
night
snouts
to
the
goddess
wolfish
corybants
intoned
their
wild
antiphonary
the
oldest
saddest
worship
in
the
world
and
jamie
watched
until
the
firelight
swirled
softly
about
him
sound
and
glimmer
merged
to
make
an
eerie
void
through
which
he
urged
with
frantic
spur
some
whirlwind
of
a
steed
that
made
the
way
as
glass
beneath
his
speed
yet
scarce
kept
pace
with
something
dear
that
fled
on
ever
half
a
dream
ahead
until
it
seemed
by
some
vague
shape
dismayed
he
cried
aloud
for
hugh
and
the
steed
a
neigh
that
was
a
burst
of
light
not
sound
and
jamie
sprawling
on
the
dewy
ground
knew
that
his
horse
was
sniffing
at
his
hair
while
mumbling
through
the
early
morning
air
there
came
a
roll
of
many
then
he
saw
the
swinging
troop
of
henry
s
men
up
the
valley
with
the
sun
of
all
hugh
s
comrades
crowding
round
not
one
but
would
have
given
heavy
odds
on
death
for
though
the
graybeard
fought
with
sobbing
breath
no
man
it
seemed
might
break
upon
the
hip
so
stern
a
wrestler
with
the
strangling
grip
that
made
the
neck
veins
like
a
purple
thong
tangled
with
knots
nor
might
hugh
tarry
long
there
where
the
trail
forked
outward
far
and
dim
or
so
it
seemed
and
when
they
lifted
him
his
moan
went
treble
like
a
song
of
pain
he
was
so
tortured
surely
it
were
vain
to
hope
he
might
endure
the
toilsome
ride
across
the
barrens
better
let
him
bide
there
on
the
grassy
couch
beside
the
spring
and
furthermore
it
seemed
a
foolish
thing
that
eighty
men
should
wait
the
issue
there
for
dying
is
a
game
of
solitaire
and
all
men
play
the
losing
hand
alone
but
when
at
noon
he
had
not
ceased
to
moan
and
fought
still
like
the
strong
man
he
had
been
there
grew
a
vague
mistrust
that
he
might
win
and
all
this
be
a
tale
for
wondering
ears
so
major
henry
called
for
volunteers
two
men
among
the
eighty
who
would
stay
to
wait
on
glass
and
keep
the
wolves
away
until
he
did
whatever
he
should
do
all
quite
agreed
twas
bitter
bread
for
hugh
yet
none
save
jamie
felt
in
duty
bound
to
run
the
the
hat
went
round
and
pity
wakened
at
the
silver
s
clink
in
jules
le
bon
he
would
not
have
them
think
that
mercenary
motives
prompted
him
but
somehow
just
the
grief
of
little
jim
was
quite
to
mention
hugh
he
weighed
the
risk
as
everybody
knew
the
rickarees
were
scattered
to
the
west
the
late
campaign
had
stirred
a
hornet
s
nest
to
fill
the
land
with
stingers
which
was
so
and
three
days
a
southwest
wind
may
blow
false
april
with
no
drop
of
dew
at
heart
so
jules
ran
on
while
ready
for
the
start
the
pawing
horses
nickered
and
the
men
impatient
in
their
saddles
yawned
and
then
with
brief
advice
a
round
of
bluff
and
some
few
reassuring
backward
cries
the
troop
rode
up
the
valley
with
the
day
intent
upon
his
friend
with
naught
to
say
sat
jamie
while
le
bon
discussed
at
length
the
reasonable
limits
of
man
s
a
dialectic
strife
that
made
absurd
all
argument
for
life
and
granted
but
a
hole
for
hugh
twas
half
like
murder
yet
it
seemed
jules
knew
unnumbered
tales
accordant
with
the
case
each
circumstantial
as
to
time
and
place
and
furnished
with
a
death
s
head
colophon
vivaciously
despondent
jules
ran
on
did
he
not
share
his
judgment
with
the
rest
you
see
twas
some
contusion
of
the
chest
that
did
the
lungs
and
all
that
mixed
in
such
a
way
they
never
could
be
fixed
a
bear
s
and
often
jamie
winced
at
some
of
reason
that
convinced
yet
left
him
sick
with
unrelinquished
hope
as
one
who
in
a
darkened
room
might
grope
for
some
belovéd
face
with
shuddering
anticipation
of
a
clammy
thing
so
in
the
lad
s
heart
sorrow
fumbled
round
for
some
old
joy
to
lean
upon
and
found
the
stark
cold
something
jamie
knew
was
there
yet
womanlike
he
stroked
the
hoary
hair
or
bathed
the
face
while
jules
found
tales
to
lugubriously
garrulous
night
fell
at
sundown
winds
are
like
to
veer
so
summoning
a
mood
of
relished
fear
le
bon
remembered
dire
alarms
by
the
swoop
of
savage
hordes
the
desperate
fight
of
men
outnumbered
and
like
him
of
old
in
all
that
made
jules
shudder
as
he
told
his
the
great
man
by
field
and
flood
upon
the
gloom
he
limned
in
blood
their
situation
s
possibilities
two
men
against
the
fury
of
the
a
game
in
which
two
hundred
men
had
failed
he
pointed
out
how
little
it
availed
to
run
the
risk
for
one
as
good
as
dead
yet
jules
le
bon
meant
every
word
he
said
and
had
a
scalp
to
lose
if
need
should
be
that
night
through
jamie
s
dreaming
swarmed
the
ree
he
wakened
to
a
dawn
of
gray
and
felt
that
something
strong
had
gone
away
nor
knew
what
thing
some
whisper
of
the
will
bade
him
rejoice
that
hugh
was
living
still
but
hugh
the
real
seemed
somehow
otherwhere
jules
snug
and
snoring
in
his
blanket
there
was
half
a
life
the
nearer
just
so
pain
is
nearer
than
the
peace
we
seek
in
vain
and
by
its
very
sting
compels
belief
jules
woke
and
with
a
fine
restraint
of
grief
saw
early
dissolution
one
more
night
and
then
the
poor
old
man
would
lose
the
ah
such
a
man
a
day
and
night
crept
by
and
yet
the
stubborn
fighter
would
not
die
but
grappled
with
the
angel
all
the
while
with
some
conviction
but
with
more
of
guile
jules
colonized
the
vacancy
with
rees
till
jamie
felt
that
looseness
of
the
knees
that
comes
of
oozing
courage
many
men
may
tower
for
a
moment
when
the
wild
blood
surges
at
a
sudden
shock
but
when
insistent
as
a
ticking
clock
blind
peril
haunts
and
whispers
fewer
dare
dread
hovered
in
the
hushed
and
moony
air
the
long
night
through
nor
might
a
fire
be
lit
lest
some
foe
take
note
of
it
and
jamie
scanned
the
blank
sky
rim
for
dust
clouds
till
there
woke
in
him
a
childish
for
ruth
and
that
hugh
so
dallied
but
the
fourth
dawn
came
and
with
it
lulled
the
fight
as
on
a
field
where
broken
armies
sleep
but
will
not
yield
or
had
one
conquered
was
it
hugh
or
death
the
old
man
breathed
with
faintly
fluttering
breath
nor
did
his
body
shudder
as
before
jules
triumphed
sadly
it
would
soon
be
o
er
so
men
grew
quiet
when
they
lost
their
grip
and
did
not
care
at
sundown
he
would
slip
into
the
deeper
jamie
wept
unwitting
how
a
furtive
gladness
crept
into
his
heart
that
gained
a
stronger
beat
so
cities
long
beleaguered
take
unto
themselves
half
traitors
jules
began
to
dig
a
hole
that
might
conceal
a
man
and
as
his
sheath
knife
broke
the
stubborn
sod
he
spoke
in
kindly
vein
of
life
and
god
and
mutability
and
rectitude
the
immemorial
funerary
mood
brought
tears
mute
tribute
to
the
and
jamie
seeing
felt
each
cutting
thrust
less
like
a
stab
into
the
flesh
of
hugh
the
sun
crept
up
and
down
the
arc
of
blue
and
through
the
air
a
chill
of
evening
ran
but
though
the
grave
yawned
waiting
for
the
man
the
man
seemed
scarce
yet
ready
for
the
grave
now
prompted
by
a
coward
or
a
knave
that
lurked
in
him
le
bon
began
to
hear
faint
sounds
that
to
the
lad
s
less
cunning
ear
were
silence
more
like
tremors
of
the
ground
they
were
jules
said
than
any
proper
thus
one
detected
horsemen
miles
away
for
many
moments
big
with
fate
he
lay
ear
pressed
to
earth
then
rose
and
shook
his
head
as
one
perplexed
there
s
something
wrong
he
said
at
daybreak
whiten
winter
skies
agape
and
staring
with
a
wild
the
lad
s
face
whitened
at
the
other

word
jules
could
not
quite
interpret
what
he
heard
a
hundred
horse
might
noise
their
whereabouts
in
just
that
fashion
yet
he
had
his
doubts
it
could
be
bison
moving
quite
as
well
but
if
twere
d
be
a
tale
to
tell
that
two
men
he
might
name
should
never
hear
he
reckoned
scalps
that
fall
were
selling
dear
in
keeping
with
the
limited
supply
men
fit
to
live
were
not
afraid
to
die
then
in
that
caution
suits
not
courage
ill
jules
saddled
up
and
cantered
to
the
hill
a
white
dam
set
against
the
twilight
stream
and
as
a
horseman
riding
in
a
dream
the
lad
beheld
him
watched
him
clamber
up
to
where
the
dusk
as
from
a
brimming
cup
ran
over
saw
him
pause
against
the
gloom
portentous
brooder
upon
doom
what
did
he
look
upon
some
moments
passed
then
suddenly
it
seemed
as
though
a
blast
of
wind
with
the
whips
of
sleet
smote
horse
and
rider
haunched
on
huddled
feet
the
steed
shrank
from
the
ridge
then
rearing
wheeled
and
took
the
rubbly
incline
those
days
and
nights
like
seasons
creeping
slow
had
told
on
jamie
better
blow
on
blow
of
evil
hap
with
doom
seen
clear
ahead
than
that
monotonous
abrasive
dread
blind
gnawer
at
the
of
the
blind
the
last
that
held
him
kind
strung
taut
the
final
tie
that
kept
him
true
now
snapped
in
jamie
as
he
saw
the
two
so
goaded
by
some
terrifying
sight
death
riding
with
the
vanguard
of
the
night
life
dwindling
yonder
with
the
rear
of
day
what
choice
for
one
whom
panic
swept
away
from
moorings
in
the
sanity
of
will
jules
came
and
summed
the
vision
of
the
hill
in
one
hoarse
cry
that
left
no
word
to
say
rees
saddle
up
we
ve
got
to
get
away
small
wit
had
jamie
left
to
ferret
guile
but
fumblingly
obeyed
le
bon
the
while
jules
knelt
beside
the
man
who
could
not
flee
for
big
hearts
lack
not
time
for
charity
however
thick
the
blows
of
fate
may
fall
yet
in
that
jules
le
bon
was
practical
he
could
not
quite
ignore
a
hunting
knife
a
flint
a
gun
a
of
life
scarce
suited
to
the
customs
of
the
dead
and
hugh
slept
soundly
in
his
ample
bed
and
blanketed
with
night
unwitting
how
venality
and
fright
made
hot
the
westward
trail
of
henry
s
men
ii
the
awakening
no
one
may
say
what
time
elapsed
or
when
the
slumberous
shadow
lifted
over
hugh
but
some
globose
immensity
of
blue
enfolded
him
at
last
within
whose
light
he
seemed
to
float
as
some
faint
swimmer
might
a
deep
beneath
and
overhead
a
deep
so
one
late
plunged
into
the
lethal
sleep
a
spirit
diver
fighting
for
his
breath
swoops
through
the
glooms
of
death
emerging
in
a
daylight
strange
and
new
rousing
a
languid
wonder
came
on
hugh
the
quiet
splendor
of
the
day
agrope
for
some
dim
memory
he
lay
upon
his
back
and
watched
a
lucent
fleece
fade
in
the
blue
profundity
of
peace
as
did
the
memory
he
sought
in
vain
then
with
a
stirring
of
mysterious
pain
old
habit
of
the
body
bade
him
rise
but
when
he
would
obey
the
hollow
skies
broke
as
a
bubble
punctured
and
went
out
again
he
woke
and
with
a
drowsy
doubt
remote
unto
his
horizontal
gaze
he
saw
the
world
s
end
kindle
to
a
blaze
and
up
the
smoky
steep
pale
heralds
run
and
when
at
length
he
knew
it
for
the
sun
dawn
found
the
darkling
reaches
of
his
mind
where
in
the
twilight
he
began
to
find
strewn
shards
and
torsos
of
familiar
things
as
from
the
rubble
in
a
place
of
kings
men
school
the
dream
to
build
the
past
anew
so
out
of
dream
and
fragment
builded
hugh
and
came
upon
the
reason
of
his
plight
the
bear
s
then
the
night
wherein
men
talked
as
ghosts
above
a
grave
some
consciousness
of
will
the
memory
gave
he
would
get
up
the
painful
effort
spent
made
the
wide
heavens
billow
as
a
tent
the
shaken
prairie
sag
and
roll
some
moments
with
an
effort
at
control
he
swayed
half
raised
upon
his
arms
until
the
dizzy
cosmos
righted
and
was
still
then
would
he
stand
erect
and
be
again
the
man
he
was
an
overwhelming
pain
smote
him
to
earth
and
one
unruly
limb
refused
the
weight
and
crumpled
under
him
sickened
with
torture
he
lay
huddled
there
gazing
about
him
with
a
great
despair
proportioned
to
the
might
that
felt
the
chain
as
dawn
collusive
sky
and
plain
stared
bleak
denial
back
why
strive
at
all
that
vacancy
about
him
like
a
wall
yielding
as
light
a
granite
scarp
to
climb
some
little
waiting
on
the
creep
of
time
abandonment
to
circumstance
and
here
flashed
a
sudden
thought
of
henry
s
men
into
his
mind
and
drove
the
gloom
away
they
would
be
riding
westward
with
the
day
how
strange
he
had
forgot
that
battered
leg
or
some
scalp
wound
had
set
his
wits
was
this
hugh
glass
to
whimper
like
a
squaw
grimly
amused
he
raised
his
head
and
the
empty
distance
listened
long
and
naught
but
the
twitter
of
a
lonely
bird
that
emphasized
the
hush
was
something
wrong
twas
not
the
major
s
way
to
dally
long
and
surely
they
had
camped
not
far
behind
now
woke
a
query
in
his
troubled
where
was
his
horse
again
came
creeping
back
the
circumstances
of
the
bear
s
attack
he
had
dismounted
thinking
at
the
spring
to
spend
the
then
the
grisly
of
course
the
horse
had
bolted
plain
enough
but
why
was
all
the
soil
about
so
rough
as
though
a
herd
of
horses
had
been
there
the
riddle
vexed
him
till
his
vacant
stare
fell
on
a
heap
of
earth
beside
a
pit
what
did
that
mean
he
wormed
his
way
to
it
the
newly
wakened
wonder
dulling
pain
no
paw
of
beast
had
scooped
was
plain
twas
squared
indeed
twas
like
a
grave
he
thought
a
mental
echo
wrought
sick
fancies
who
had
risen
from
the
dead
who
lying
there
had
heard
above
his
head
the
ghostly
talkers
deaf
unto
his
shout
now
searching
all
the
region
round
about
as
though
the
answer
were
a
lurking
thing
he
saw
along
the
margin
of
the
spring
an
and
the
litter
of
a
camp
suspicion
like
a
little
smoky
lamp
that
daubs
the
murk
but
can
not
fathom
it
flung
blear
grotesques
before
his
groping
wit
had
rees
been
there
and
he
alive
who
then
and
were
he
dead
it
might
be
henry
s
men
how
many
suns
had
risen
while
he
slept
the
smoky
glow
flared
wildly
and
he
crept
the
dragged
limb
throbbing
till
at
length
he
found
the
trail
of
many
horses
westward
bound
and
in
one
breath
the
groping
light
became
a
ecstasy
of
flame
a
dazing
conflagration
of
belief
plunged
deeper
than
the
seats
of
hate
and
grief
he
gazed
about
for
aught
that
might
deny
such
baseness
saw
the
sky
the
prairie
apathetic
in
a
shroud
the
bland
complacence
of
a
vagrant
connivance
smilingly
the
sun
approved
a
land
wherein
such
deeds
were
done
and
careless
breezes
like
a
troop
of
youth
unawed
before
the
presence
of
such
truth
went
scampering
amid
the
tousled
brush
then
bye
and
bye
came
on
him
with
a
rush
his
weakness
and
the
consciousness
of
pain
while
with
the
chill
insistence
of
a
rain
that
pelts
the
sodden
wreck
of
summer
s
end
his
manifest
betrayal
by
a
friend
beat
in
upon
him
jamie
had
been
there
and
did
not
care
what
no
man
yet
had
witnessed
the
wide
sky
looked
down
and
saw
a
light
wind
idling
by
heard
what
no
ear
of
mortal
yet
had
heard
for
name
was
like
a
magic
word
to
conjure
the
remote
heroic
mood
of
valiant
deed
and
splendid
fortitude
wherever
two
that
shared
a
fire
might
be
gave
way
to
grief
and
wept
unmanfully
yet
not
as
they
for
whom
tears
fall
like
dew
to
green
a
frosted
heart
again
wept
hugh
so
thewed
to
strive
so
engined
to
prevail
and
make
harsh
fate
the
zany
of
a
tale
his
own
might
shook
and
tore
him
for
a
span
he
lay
a
gray
old
ruin
of
a
man
with
all
his
years
upon
him
like
a
snow
and
then
at
length
as
from
the
long
ago
remote
beyond
the
other
side
of
wrong
the
old
love
came
like
some
remembered
song
whereof
the
strain
is
sweet
the
burden
sad
a
retrospective
vision
of
the
lad
grew
up
in
him
as
in
a
foggy
night
the
witchery
of
semilunar
light
mysteriously
quickens
all
the
air
some
memory
of
golden
hair
the
boyish
laugh
the
merry
eyes
of
blue
wrought
marvelously
in
the
heart
of
hugh
as
under
snow
the
dæmon
of
the
spring
and
momently
it
seemed
a
little
thing
to
suffer
nor
might
treachery
recall
the
miracle
of
being
loved
at
all
the
privilege
of
loving
to
the
end
and
thereupon
a
longing
for
his
friend
made
life
once
more
a
struggle
for
a
to
look
again
upon
the
merry
eyes
to
see
again
the
golden
hair
aye
one
should
lavish
very
tender
care
upon
the
vessel
of
a
hope
so
great
lest
it
be
shattered
and
the
precious
freight
as
water
on
the
arid
waste
poured
out
yet
though
he
longed
to
live
a
subtle
doubt
still
turned
on
him
the
weapon
of
his
pain
now
as
before
collusive
sky
and
plain
outstared
his
purpose
for
a
puny
thing
praying
to
live
he
crawled
back
to
the
spring
with
something
in
his
heart
like
gratitude
that
by
good
luck
his
gun
might
furnish
food
his
blanket
shelter
and
his
flint
a
fire
for
after
all
what
thing
do
men
desire
to
be
or
have
but
these
condition
it
these
with
a
purpose
and
a
little
wit
and
howsoever
smitten
one
might
rise
push
back
the
curtain
of
the
curving
skies
and
come
upon
the
living
dream
at
last
exhausted
by
the
spring
he
lay
and
cast
dull
eyes
about
him
what
did
it
portend
naught
but
the
footprints
of
a
fickle
friend
a
yawning
grave
and
ashes
met
his
eyes
scarce
feeling
yet
the
shock
of
a
surprise
he
searched
about
him
for
his
flint
and
knife
knew
vaguely
that
his
seeking
was
for
life
and
that
the
place
was
empty
where
he
sought
no
food
no
fire
no
shelter
dully
wrought
the
bleak
negation
in
him
slowly
crept
to
where
despite
the
pain
his
love
had
kept
a
shrine
for
jamie
undefiled
of
doubt
then
suddenly
conviction
like
a
shout
aroused
him
was
a
thief
the
very
difficulty
of
belief
was
fuel
for
the
simmering
of
rage
that
grew
and
grew
the
more
he
strove
to
gage
the
underlying
motive
of
the
deed
untempered
youth
might
fail
a
friend
in
need
but
here
had
wrought
some
devil
of
the
will
some
heartless
thing
too
cowardly
to
kill
that
left
to
nature
what
it
dared
not
do
so
bellowsed
all
the
kindled
soul
of
hugh
became
a
still
white
hell
of
brooding
ire
and
through
his
veins
regenerating
fire
ran
driving
out
the
lethargy
of
pain
now
once
again
he
scanned
the
yellow
plain
conspirant
with
the
overbending
skies
and
lo
the
one
was
blue
as
jamie
s
eyes
the
other
of
the
color
of
his
twin
hues
of
falseness
merging
to
a
stare
as
though
such
guilt
thus
visibly
immense
regarded
its
effect
with
insolence
alas
for
those
who
fondly
place
above
the
act
of
loving
what
they
chance
to
love
who
prize
the
goal
more
dearly
than
the
way
for
time
shall
plunder
them
and
change
betray
and
life
shall
find
them
vulnerable
still
a
narcotic
to
the
will
hugh
s
love
increased
the
peril
of
his
plight
but
anger
broke
the
slumber
of
his
might
quickened
the
heart
and
warmed
the
blood
that
ran
defiance
for
the
treachery
of
man
defiance
for
the
meaning
of
his
pain
defiance
for
the
distance
of
the
plain
that
seemed
to
gloat
you
can
not
master
and
for
one
burning
moment
he
felt
free
to
rise
and
conquer
in
a
wind
of
rage
but
as
a
tiger
conscious
of
the
cage
with
a
purpose
broods
and
waits
so
with
the
sullen
patience
that
is
hate
s
hugh
taught
his
wrath
to
bide
expedience
now
cognizant
of
every
quickened
sense
thirst
came
upon
him
leaning
to
the
spring
he
stared
with
fascination
on
a
thing
that
rose
from
giddy
deeps
to
share
the
a
face
it
was
so
tortured
that
it
laughed
a
ghastly
mask
that
murder
well
might
wear
and
while
as
one
they
drank
together
there
it
was
as
though
the
deed
he
meant
to
do
took
shape
and
came
to
kiss
the
lips
of
hugh
lest
that
revenge
might
falter
hunger
woke
and
from
the
bush
with
leafage
gray
as
smoke
wherein
like
flame
the
bullberries
glinted
red
scarce
sweeter
than
the
heart
of
him
they
fed
hugh
feasted
and
the
hours
of
waiting
crept
and
though
he
waked
or
slept
the
pondered
purpose
or
a
dream
that
wrought
by
night
the
murder
of
his
waking
thought
sustained
him
till
he
felt
his
strength
returned
and
then
at
length
the
morning
burned
and
beckoned
down
the
vast
way
he
should
that
waste
to
be
surmounted
as
a
wall
and
yet
more
steep
to
that
simulacrum
of
enduring
the
hundred
empty
miles
twixt
him
and
where
the
stark
missouri
ran
yet
why
not
dare
despite
the
useless
leg
he
could
not
die
one
hairsbreadth
farther
from
the
earth
and
sky
or
more
remote
from
kindness
iii
the
crawl
straight
away
beneath
the
flare
of
dawn
the
ree
land
lay
and
through
it
ran
the
short
trail
to
the
goal
thereon
a
grim
turnpikeman
waited
toll
but
twas
so
doomed
that
southering
geese
should
flee
nine
times
ere
yet
the
vengeance
of
the
ree
should
make
their
foe
the
haunter
of
a
tale
midway
to
safety
on
the
northern
trail
the
scoriac
region
of
a
hell
burned
black
forbade
the
crawler
and
for
all
his
lack
hugh
had
no
heart
to
journey
with
the
suns
no
suppliant
unto
those
faithless
ones
should
bid
for
pity
at
the
big
horn
s
mouth
the
greater
odds
for
safety
in
the
south
allured
him
so
he
felt
the
midday
sun
blaze
down
the
coulee
of
a
little
run
that
dwindled
upward
to
the
watershed
whereon
the
feeders
of
the
moreau
scarce
more
than
runes
of
vernal
rain
the
trailing
leg
was
like
a
galling
chain
and
bound
him
to
a
doubt
that
would
not
pass
defiant
clumps
of
grass
that
bit
parched
earth
with
bared
and
roots
dwarf
thickets
jealous
for
their
stunted
fruits
by
their
these
symbolized
the
enmity
of
chance
for
him
who
with
his
fate
unreconciled
equipped
for
travel
as
a
weanling
child
essayed
the
journey
of
a
mighty
man
like
agitated
oil
the
ran
and
made
the
scabrous
gulch
appear
to
shake
as
some
reflected
landscape
in
a
lake
where
laggard
breezes
move
a
taunting
reek
rose
from
the
grudging
seepage
of
the
creek
whereof
hugh
drank
and
drank
and
still
would
drink
and
where
the
mottled
shadow
dripped
as
ink
from
scanty
thickets
on
the
yellow
glare
the
crawler
faltered
with
no
heart
to
dare
again
the
torture
of
that
toil
until
the
of
vengeance
woke
the
will
to
goad
him
forth
and
when
the
sun
quiesced
amid
ironic
heavens
in
the
the
region
of
false
gained
a
rise
whence
to
the
fading
cincture
of
the
skies
a
purpling
panorama
swept
away
scarce
farther
than
a
shout
might
carry
lay
the
place
of
his
betrayal
he
could
see
the
yellow
blotch
of
earth
where
treachery
had
digged
his
grave
o
futile
wrath
and
toil
tucked
in
beneath
yon
coverlet
of
soil
turned
back
for
him
how
soundly
had
he
slept
fool
fool
to
struggle
when
he
might
have
crept
so
short
a
space
yet
farther
than
the
flight
of
swiftest
dreaming
through
the
longest
night
into
the
quiet
house
of
no
false
friend
alas
for
those
who
seek
a
journey
s
they
have
it
ever
with
them
like
a
ghost
nor
shall
they
find
who
deem
they
seek
it
most
but
crave
the
end
of
human
hugh
now
swoopingly
the
world
of
dream
broke
through
the
figured
wall
of
sense
it
seemed
he
ran
as
wind
above
the
creeping
ways
of
man
and
came
upon
the
place
of
his
desire
where
burned
as
a
the
face
of
jamie
but
the
vengeful
stroke
bit
air
the
darkness
lifted
like
a
and
it
was
early
morning
gazing
far
from
where
the
west
yet
kept
a
pallid
star
to
thinner
sky
where
dawn
was
wearing
through
hugh
shrank
with
dread
reluctant
to
renew
the
war
with
that
serene
antagonist
more
fearsome
than
a
smashing
iron
fist
seemed
that
vast
negativity
of
might
until
the
frustrate
vision
of
the
night
came
moonwise
on
the
gloom
of
his
despair
and
lo
the
foe
was
naught
but
yielding
air
a
vacancy
to
fill
with
his
intent
so
from
his
spacious
bed
he
rose
and
went
and
the
vision
goaded
him
all
morning
southward
to
the
bare
sky
rim
the
rugged
coulee
zigzagged
mounting
slow
and
ever
as
it
rose
the
lean
creek
s
flow
dwindled
and
dwindled
steadily
until
at
last
a
basin
would
not
fill
and
thenceforth
twas
a
way
of
mocking
dust
but
in
that
hugh
still
kept
the
driving
lust
for
vengeance
this
new
circumstance
of
fate
served
but
to
brew
more
venom
for
his
hate
and
nerved
him
to
avail
the
most
with
least
ere
noon
the
crawler
chanced
upon
a
feast
of
breadroot
sunning
in
a
favored
draw
a
sentry
gopher
from
his
stronghold
saw
some
beast
yet
not
a
bear
with
quite
misguided
fury
digging
where
no
hapless
brother
gopher
might
be
found
and
while
with
stripéd
nose
above
his
mound
the
sentinel
chirped
shrilly
to
his
clan
of
that
anomaly
the
man
devoured
the
manna
of
the
plains
that
some
vague
reminiscence
of
old
rains
kept
succulent
despite
the
burning
drouth
so
with
new
vigor
hugh
assailed
the
south
his
pockets
laden
with
the
precious
roots
against
that
coming
traverse
where
no
fruits
of
herb
or
vine
or
shrub
might
brave
the
land
spread
rooflike
twixt
the
moreau
and
the
grand
the
coulee
deepened
yellow
walls
flung
high
sheer
to
the
ragged
strip
of
blinding
sky
dazzled
and
sweltered
in
the
glare
of
day
capricious
draughts
that
woke
and
died
away
into
the
heavy
drowse
were
breatht
as
flame
and
midway
down
the
afternoon
hugh
came
upon
a
little
patch
of
spongy
ground
his
thirst
became
a
rage
he
gazed
around
seeking
a
spring
but
all
about
was
dry
as
strewn
bones
bleaching
to
a
desert
sky
nor
did
a
clawed
hole
bought
with
needed
strength
return
a
grateful
ooze
and
when
at
length
hugh
sucked
the
mud
he
spat
it
in
disgust
it
had
the
acrid
tang
of
broken
trust
the
sweetish
tepid
taste
of
feigning
love
still
hopeful
of
a
spring
somewhere
above
he
crawled
the
faster
for
his
taunted
thirst
more
damp
spots
no
less
grudging
than
the
first
occurred
with
growing
frequence
on
the
way
until
amid
the
purple
wane
of
day
the
crawler
came
upon
a
little
pool
clear
as
a
friend
s
heart
twas
and
seeming
a
crystal
bowl
whence
skyey
deeps
looked
up
so
might
a
god
set
down
his
drinking
cup
charged
with
a
distillation
of
haut
skies
as
famished
horses
thrusting
to
the
eyes
parched
muzzles
take
a
hugh
plunged
his
head
into
the
brimming
bowl
as
though
to
share
the
joy
with
every
sense
and
lo
the
tang
of
that
wide
insolence
of
sky
and
plain
was
acrid
in
the
draught
how
ripplingly
the
lying
water
laughed
how
like
fine
sentiment
the
mirrored
sky
won
credence
for
a
sink
of
alkali
so
with
false
friends
and
yet
as
may
accrue
from
specious
love
some
profit
of
the
true
one
gift
of
kindness
had
the
tainted
sink
stripped
of
his
clothes
hugh
let
his
body
drink
at
every
thirsting
pore
through
trunk
and
limb
the
elemental
blessing
solaced
him
nor
did
he
rise
till
vague
with
stellar
light
the
lone
gulch
buttressing
an
arch
of
night
was
like
a
temple
to
the
holy
ghost
as
priests
in
slow
procession
with
the
host
a
gusty
breeze
low
now
loud
and
now
as
to
the
murmur
of
a
crowd
yielding
the
wonder
of
the
nave
aloft
along
the
dusky
architrave
the
of
drifting
stars
evolved
and
hugh
lay
gazing
till
the
whole
resolved
into
a
haze
it
seemed
that
little
jim
had
come
to
share
a
merry
fire
with
him
and
there
had
been
no
trouble
twixt
the
two
and
jamie
listened
eagerly
while
hugh
essayed
a
tangled
tale
of
bears
and
men
and
stars
but
ever
now
and
then
the
shifting
dimmed
the
golden
hair
the
leal
blue
eyes
until
with
sudden
flare
the
flame
effaced
them
lo
the
gulch
with
morning
loath
to
go
hugh
lay
beside
the
pool
and
pondered
fate
he
saw
his
pilgrimage
of
hate
stretch
fool
s
trail
and
it
made
him
cringe
for
still
amid
the
nightly
vision
s
fringe
his
dull
wit
strayed
companioned
with
regret
but
when
the
sun
a
tilted
cauldron
set
upon
the
gulch
rim
poured
a
blaze
of
day
he
rose
and
bathed
again
and
went
his
way
sustaining
wrath
returning
with
the
toil
at
noon
the
gulch
walls
hewn
in
lighter
soil
fell
back
and
coulees
dense
with
shrub
and
vine
climbed
zigzag
to
the
sharp
horizon
line
whence
one
might
choose
the
pilotage
of
crows
he
labored
upward
through
the
noonday
doze
of
breathless
shade
where
plums
were
turning
red
in
tangled
bowers
and
grapevines
overhead
purpled
with
fruit
to
taunt
the
crawler
s
thirst
with
little
effort
hugh
attained
the
first
the
latter
bargained
sharply
ere
they
sold
their
luscious
clusters
for
the
hoarded
gold
of
strength
that
had
so
very
much
to
buy
now
having
feasted
it
was
sweet
to
lie
beneath
a
canopy
and
sleep
came
swiftly
hugh
awakened
to
some
deep
well
of
night
awhile
he
lay
and
wondered
what
had
happened
to
the
day
and
where
he
was
and
what
were
best
to
do
but
when
the
drowse
dispersed
he
knew
how
from
the
rim
above
the
plain
stretched
far
to
where
the
evening
and
the
morning
are
and
that
twere
better
he
should
crawl
by
night
sleep
out
the
glare
with
groping
hands
for
sight
skyward
along
the
broken
steep
he
crawled
and
saw
at
length
immense
and
or
dusky
mystery
of
plain
gazing
aloft
he
found
the
capsized
wain
in
down
the
polar
steep
thereto
he
set
his
back
and
far
ahead
there
grew
as
some
pale
blossom
from
a
darkling
root
the
summit
of
a
lonely
butte
and
thitherward
he
dragged
his
heavy
limb
it
seemed
naught
moved
time
hovered
over
him
an
instant
of
incipient
endeavor
twas
ever
thus
and
should
be
thus
this
groping
for
the
same
armful
of
space
an
insubstantial
essence
of
one
place
extentless
on
a
weird
frontier
of
sleep
sheer
deep
upon
unfathomable
deep
the
flood
of
dusk
bore
down
without
a
sound
as
ocean
on
the
spirits
of
the
drowned
awakened
headlong
leagues
beneath
the
light
so
lapsed
the
drowsy
æon
of
the
a
strangely
tensile
moment
in
a
trance
and
then
as
quickened
to
somnambulance
the
heavens
imperceptibly
in
motion
were
altered
as
the
upward
deeps
of
ocean
diluted
with
a
seepage
of
the
moon
the
late
a
gossamer
balloon
in
tethered
hovering
grew
down
and
rooted
in
a
blear
expanse
of
brown
that
lifting
slowly
with
the
ebb
of
night
took
on
the
harsh
solidity
of
and
day
was
on
the
prairie
like
a
flame
scarce
had
he
munched
the
hoarded
roots
when
came
a
vertigo
of
slumber
snatchy
dreams
of
sick
pools
inaccessible
cool
streams
lured
on
through
giddy
vacancies
of
heat
in
swooping
flights
now
hills
of
roasting
meat
made
savory
the
oven
of
the
world
yet
kept
remote
peripheries
and
whirled
about
a
burning
center
that
was
hugh
then
all
were
gone
save
one
and
it
turned
blue
and
was
a
heap
of
cool
and
luscious
fruit
until
at
length
he
knew
it
for
the
butte
now
mantled
with
a
weaving
of
the
gloam
it
was
the
hour
when
cattle
straggle
home
across
the
clearing
in
a
hush
of
sleep
they
saunter
lowing
loiter
amid
the
lush
grass
by
the
meadow
stream
how
like
the
sound
of
water
in
a
dream
the
intermittent
tinkle
of
yon
bell
a
windlass
creaks
contentment
from
a
well
and
cool
deeps
gurgle
as
the
bucket
sinks
now
blowing
at
the
trough
the
drinks
the
shaken
harness
rattles
sleepy
quails
call
far
the
warm
milk
hisses
in
the
pails
there
in
the
dusky
crickets
cry
the
meadow
twinkles
with
the
glowing
fly
one
hears
the
horses
munching
at
their
oats
the
green
grows
black
a
veil
of
slumber
floats
across
the
haunts
of
men
some
freak
of
memory
brought
back
again
the
boyhood
world
of
sight
and
scent
and
sound
it
perished
and
the
prairie
ringed
him
round
blank
as
the
face
of
fate
in
listless
mood
hugh
set
his
face
against
the
solitude
and
met
the
night
the
new
moon
low
and
far
a
frail
cup
tilted
nor
the
star
it
seemed
might
glint
on
any
stream
or
spring
or
touch
with
silver
any
toothsome
thing
the
kiote
voiced
the
universal
lack
as
from
a
nether
fire
the
plain
gave
back
the
swelter
of
the
to
the
gloom
in
the
hot
hush
hugh
heard
his
temples
boom
thirst
tortured
motion
was
a
languid
pain
why
seek
some
further
nowhere
on
the
plain
here
might
the
kiotes
feast
as
well
as
there
so
spoke
some
spirit
of
despair
and
still
hugh
moved
weight
submissive
to
that
now
unconscious
hate
as
darkling
water
to
the
hidden
moon
now
when
the
night
wore
on
in
middle
swoon
the
crawler
roused
from
stupor
was
aware
of
some
strange
alteration
in
the
air
to
breathe
became
an
act
of
conscious
will
the
starry
waste
was
ominously
still
the
kiote
s
yelp
came
sharp
and
clear
as
through
a
tunnel
in
the
a
ponderable
resonating
mass
the
limp
leg
dragging
on
the
grass
produced
a
sound
unnaturally
loud
crouched
panting
hugh
looked
up
but
saw
no
cloud
an
oily
film
seemed
spread
upon
the
sky
now
dully
staring
as
the
open
eye
of
one
in
fever
gasping
choked
with
thirst
a
childish
rage
assailed
hugh
and
he
cursed
twas
like
a
broken
spirit
s
outcry
tossed
upon
hell
s
burlesque
sabbath
for
the
lost
and
briefly
space
seemed
crowded
with
the
voice
to
wait
and
die
to
move
and
choice
hugh
chose
not
yet
he
crawled
though
more
and
more
he
felt
the
futile
strife
was
nearly
o
er
and
as
he
went
a
muffled
rumbling
grew
more
felt
than
heard
for
long
it
puzzled
hugh
somehow
twas
coextensive
with
his
thirst
yet
boundless
swollen
ere
they
burst
might
give
such
warning
so
he
thought
and
still
the
drone
seemed
heaping
up
a
phonic
hill
that
towered
in
a
listening
profound
then
suddenly
a
mountain
peak
of
sound
came
toppling
to
a
fall
the
prairie
shuddered
and
a
raucous
drawl
ran
far
and
perished
in
the
outer
deep
as
one
too
roughly
shaken
out
of
sleep
hugh
stared
bewildered
still
the
face
of
night
remained
the
same
save
where
upon
his
right
the
moon
had
vanished
neath
the
prairie
rim
then
suddenly
the
meaning
came
to
him
he
turned
and
saw
athwart
the
northwest
sky
like
some
black
eyelid
shutting
on
an
eye
a
coming
night
to
which
the
night
was
day
ranged
in
regular
array
the
lifting
mass
assailed
the
dragon
s
lair
submerged
the
region
of
the
hounded
bear
the
tall
and
the
pole
and
all
the
while
there
came
a
roll
less
sound
in
air
than
tremor
in
the
earth
from
where
like
flame
upon
a
windy
hearth
deep
in
the
further
murk
flared
and
still
the
southern
arc
of
heaven
stared
a
eye
near
blind
with
fever
rheum
and
still
the
plain
lay
tranquil
as
a
tomb
wherein
the
dead
reck
not
a
menaced
world
what
turmoil
now
lo
ragged
columns
hurled
up
stellar
slopes
swift
blue
fires
leap
above
the
wild
assailants
of
the
steep
along
the
solid
rear
a
dull
boom
runs
so
light
horse
squadrons
charge
beneath
the
guns
now
once
again
the
night
is
deathly
still
what
ghastly
peace
upon
the
zenith
hill
no
longer
starry
not
a
sound
is
heard
so
poised
the
hush
it
seems
a
whispered
word
might
loose
all
noises
in
an
avalanche
only
the
black
mass
moves
and
far
glooms
blanch
with
fitful
flashes
the
capricious
flare
reveals
the
tall
and
lonely
there
like
some
gray
prophet
contemplating
doom
but
hark
what
spirits
whisper
in
the
gloom
what
sibilation
of
conspiracies
ruffles
the
murmuring
of
trees
ghosts
of
the
ancient
old
rain
in
some
hallucination
of
the
plain
a
frustrate
phantom
mourning
all
around
that
e
er
evolving
ne
er
resolving
sound
gropes
in
the
stifling
hollow
of
the
night
blade
of
blinding
light
ripped
up
the
heavens
and
the
deluge
a
burst
of
wind
and
water
noise
and
flame
that
hurled
the
watcher
flat
upon
the
ground
a
moment
past
hugh
famished
now
half
drowned
he
gasped
for
breath
amid
the
hurtling
drench
so
might
a
testy
god
long
sought
to
quench
a
puny
thirst
pour
wassail
hurling
after
the
crashing
bowl
with
wild
sardonic
laughter
to
see
man
wrestle
with
his
answered
prayer
prone
to
the
roaring
flaw
and
ceaseless
flare
the
man
drank
deeply
with
the
drinking
grass
until
it
seemed
the
storm
would
never
pass
but
ravin
down
the
painted
murk
for
aye
when
had
what
dreamer
seen
a
glaring
day
and
leagues
of
prairie
pantingly
aquiver
flame
flood
wind
noise
and
darkness
were
a
river
tearing
a
cosmic
channel
to
no
sea
the
tortured
night
wore
on
then
suddenly
peace
fell
remotely
the
retreating
wrath
trailed
dull
reluctant
thunders
in
its
path
and
up
along
a
broken
stair
of
cloud
the
dawn
came
creeping
whitely
like
a
shroud
gray
vapors
clung
along
the
sodden
plain
up
rose
the
sun
to
wipe
the
final
stain
of
fury
from
the
sky
and
drink
the
mist
against
a
flawless
arch
of
amethyst
the
butte
soared
like
a
soul
serene
and
white
because
of
the
katharsis
of
the
night
all
day
hugh
fought
with
sleep
and
struggled
on
southeastward
for
the
heavy
heat
was
gone
despite
the
naked
sun
the
blank
northwest
breathed
coolly
and
the
crawler
thought
it
best
to
move
while
yet
each
little
break
and
hollow
and
shallow
basin
of
the
begrudged
the
earth
and
air
its
dwindling
store
but
now
that
thirst
was
conquered
more
and
more
he
felt
the
gnaw
of
hunger
like
a
rage
and
once
from
dozing
in
a
clump
of
sage
a
lone
jackrabbit
bounded
as
a
flame
hope
flared
in
hugh
until
the
memory
came
of
him
who
robbed
a
sleeping
friend
and
fled
then
hate
and
hunger
merged
the
man
saw
red
and
momently
the
hare
and
little
jim
were
one
blurred
mark
for
murder
unto
elusive
taunting
sweet
to
clutch
and
tear
the
rabbit
paused
to
scan
the
crippled
bear
that
ground
its
teeth
as
though
it
chewed
a
root
but
when
in
witless
rage
hugh
drew
his
boot
and
hurled
it
with
a
curse
the
hare
loped
off
its
critic
ears
turned
back
as
though
to
scoff
at
silly
brutes
that
threw
their
legs
away
night
like
a
shadow
on
enduring
day
swooped
by
the
dream
of
crawling
and
the
act
were
phases
of
one
everlasting
fact
hugh
woke
and
he
was
doing
what
he
dreamed
the
butte
outstripped
at
eventide
now
seemed
intent
to
follow
ever
now
and
then
the
crawler
paused
to
calculate
again
what
yawn
of
distance
dwarfed
the
hill
close
in
the
rear
it
soared
a
titan
still
whose
saunter
kept
the
pace
distinct
along
the
southern
rim
of
space
a
low
ridge
lay
the
crest
of
the
divide
what
rest
and
plenty
on
the
other
side
through
what
lush
valleys
ran
what
crystal
brooks
and
there
in
virgin
meadows
wayside
nooks
with
leaf
and
purple
cluster
dulled
the
light
all
day
it
seemed
that
distant
pisgah
height
retreated
and
the
tall
butte
dogged
the
rear
at
eve
a
stripéd
gopher
chirping
near
gave
hugh
an
inspiration
now
at
least
no
thieving
friend
should
rob
him
of
a
feast
his
great
idea
stirred
him
as
a
shout
off
came
a
boot
a
sock
was
ravelled
out
the
coarse
yarn
fashioned
to
a
running
snare
he
placed
about
the
gopher
s
hole
with
care
and
then
withdrew
to
hold
the
yarn
and
wait
the
moments
ponderous
with
fate
crept
slowly
by
the
battered
gray
face
leered
in
expectation
down
the
grizzled
beard
ran
slaver
from
anticipating
jaws
evolving
twilight
hovered
to
a
pause
the
light
wind
fell
again
and
yet
again
the
man
devoured
his
fancied
prey
and
then
within
the
noose
a
timid
snout
was
thrust
his
hand
unsteadied
with
the
hunger
lust
hugh
jerked
the
yarn
it
broke
down
swooped
the
night
a
shadow
of
despair
bleak
height
on
height
it
seemed
a
sheer
abyss
enclosed
him
round
clutching
a
strand
of
yarn
he
heard
the
sound
of
some
infernal
turmoil
under
him
grimly
he
strove
to
reach
the
ragged
rim
that
snared
a
star
until
the
skyey
space
was
darkened
with
a
roof
of
jamie
s
face
and
then
the
yarn
was
broken
and
he
fell
like
a
stricken
bat
his
yell
woke
hordes
of
laughers
down
the
giddy
yawn
of
that
black
suddenly
twas
dawn
yet
possest
by
one
stern
dream
more
clamorous
than
the
rest
hugh
headed
for
a
gap
that
notched
the
hills
wherethrough
a
luring
murmur
of
cool
rills
a
haunting
smell
of
verdure
seemed
to
creep
by
fits
the
wild
adventure
of
his
sleep
became
the
cause
of
all
his
waking
care
and
he
complained
unto
the
empty
air
how
jamie
broke
the
yarn
the
sun
and
breeze
had
drunk
all
shallow
basins
to
the
lees
but
now
and
then
some
gully
choked
with
mud
retained
a
turbid
relict
of
the
flood
and
still
obsessed
by
that
one
dream
more
clamorous
than
the
rest
hugh
struggled
for
the
crest
of
the
divide
and
when
at
length
he
saw
the
other
side
twas
but
a
rumpled
waste
of
yellow
hills
the
wiser
self
had
known
the
rills
and
nooks
to
be
the
facture
of
a
whim
yet
had
the
pleasant
lie
befriended
him
and
now
the
brutal
fact
had
come
to
stare
succumbing
to
a
languorous
despair
he
mourned
his
fate
with
childish
uncontrol
and
nursed
that
deadly
adder
of
the
soul
let
the
crows
swoop
down
and
feed
aye
batten
on
a
thing
that
died
of
need
a
poor
old
wretch
betrayed
of
god
and
man
so
peevishly
his
broken
musing
ran
till
glutted
with
the
luxury
of
woe
he
turned
to
see
the
butte
that
he
might
know
how
little
all
his
striving
could
avail
against
and
lo
a
at
held
could
blot
it
out
of
space
a
goading
purpose
and
a
creeping
pace
had
dwarfed
the
titan
in
a
haze
of
blue
and
suddenly
new
power
came
to
hugh
with
gazing
on
his
masterpiece
of
will
so
fare
the
wise
on
pisgah
down
the
hill
unto
the
higher
vision
consecrate
now
sallied
forth
the
new
a
weariness
a
hunger
and
a
against
tyrannic
chance
as
in
a
story
some
higher
hugh
observed
the
baser
part
so
sits
the
artist
throned
above
his
art
nor
recks
the
travail
so
the
end
be
fair
it
seemed
the
wrinkled
hills
pressed
in
to
stare
the
arch
of
heaven
was
an
eye
and
as
hugh
went
he
fashioned
many
a
phrase
for
use
when
by
some
friendly
his
tale
of
things
endured
should
speed
the
night
and
all
this
gloom
grow
golden
in
the
sharing
so
wrought
the
old
evangel
of
high
daring
the
duty
and
the
beauty
of
endeavor
the
privilege
of
going
on
forever
a
victor
in
the
moment
ah
but
when
the
night
slipped
by
and
morning
came
again
the
sky
and
hill
were
only
sky
and
hill
and
crawling
but
an
agony
of
will
so
once
again
the
old
triumvirate
a
buzzard
hunger
and
a
viper
hate
together
with
the
baser
part
of
hugh
went
visionless
that
day
the
wild
geese
flew
vague
in
a
gray
profundity
of
sky
and
on
into
the
night
their
muffled
cry
haunted
the
moonlight
like
a
far
farewell
it
made
hugh
homesick
though
he
could
not
tell
for
what
he
yearned
and
in
his
fitful
sleeping
the
cry
became
the
sound
of
jamie
weeping
immeasurably
distant
morning
broke
blear
chilly
through
a
fog
that
drove
as
smoke
before
the
booming
northwest
sweet
and
sad
came
creeping
back
old
visions
of
the
some
trick
of
speech
some
merry
little
lilt
the
brooding
blue
of
eyes
too
clear
for
guilt
the
golden
hair
hate
slept
that
day
and
half
of
hugh
was
half
a
life
away
a
wandering
spirit
wistful
of
the
past
and
half
went
drifting
with
the
autumn
blast
that
mourned
among
the
melancholy
hills
for
something
of
the
lethargy
that
kills
came
creeping
close
upon
the
ebb
of
hate
only
the
raw
wind
like
the
lash
of
fate
could
have
availed
to
move
him
any
more
at
last
the
buzzard
beak
no
longer
tore
his
vitals
and
he
ceased
to
think
of
food
the
fighter
slumbered
and
a
maudlin
mood
foretold
the
dissolution
of
the
man
he
sobbed
and
down
his
beard
the
big
tears
ran
and
now
the
scene
is
changed
the
bleak
wind
s
cry
becomes
a
flight
of
bullets
snarling
by
from
where
on
yonder
summit
skulk
the
rees
against
the
sky
in
silhouette
he
sees
the
headstrong
jamie
in
the
leaden
rain
and
now
serenely
beautiful
and
slain
the
dear
lad
lies
within
a
gusty
tent
thus
vexed
with
doleful
whims
the
crawler
went
adrift
before
the
wind
nor
saw
the
trail
till
close
on
night
he
knew
a
rugged
vale
had
closed
about
him
and
a
hush
was
there
though
still
a
moaning
in
the
upper
air
told
how
the
gale
blew
out
the
day
beneath
a
clump
of
brush
he
swooned
away
into
an
icy
void
and
waking
numb
it
seemed
the
still
white
dawn
of
death
had
come
on
this
some
of
the
soul
he
saw
a
dim
enchanted
hollow
roll
beneath
him
and
the
brush
thereof
was
fleece
and
like
the
body
of
the
perfect
peace
that
thralled
the
whole
abode
the
break
of
day
it
seemed
no
wind
had
ever
come
that
way
nor
sound
dwelt
there
nor
echo
found
the
place
and
hugh
lay
lapped
in
wonderment
a
space
vexed
with
a
snarl
whereof
the
ends
were
lost
till
shivering
he
wondered
if
a
frost
had
fallen
with
the
dying
of
the
blast
so
vaguely
troubled
listlessly
he
cast
a
gaze
about
him
lo
above
his
head
the
curtain
of
his
chilly
bed
was
broidered
thick
with
plums
or
so
it
seemed
for
he
was
half
persuaded
that
he
dreamed
and
with
a
steady
stare
he
strove
to
keep
that
treasure
for
the
other
side
of
sleep
returning
hunger
bade
him
rise
in
vain
he
struggled
with
a
mesh
of
pain
that
trammelled
him
until
a
yellow
stream
of
day
flowed
down
the
white
vale
of
a
dream
and
left
it
disenchanted
in
the
glare
then
warmed
and
soothed
hugh
rose
and
feasted
there
and
thought
once
more
of
reaching
the
moreau
to
southward
with
a
painful
pace
and
slow
he
went
and
a
gnawing
ache
in
that
he
had
for
jamie
s
sake
oft
made
him
wrought
a
tender
mood
the
rankling
weapon
of
ingratitude
was
turned
again
with
every
puckering
twinge
far
down
the
vale
a
narrow
winding
fringe
of
wilted
green
betokened
how
a
spring
there
sent
a
little
rill
meandering
and
hugh
was
greatly
heartened
for
he
knew
what
fruits
and
herbs
might
flourish
in
the
slough
and
thirst
henceforth
should
torture
not
again
so
day
on
day
despite
the
crawler
s
pain
all
in
the
windless
golden
autumn
weather
these
two
as
comrades
struggled
south
the
homeless
graybeard
and
the
homing
rill
and
one
was
sullen
with
the
lust
to
kill
and
one
went
crooning
of
the
vast
for
each
the
peace
at
last
but
oh
the
boon
of
singing
on
the
way
so
came
these
in
the
golden
fall
of
day
unto
a
sudden
turn
in
the
ravine
wherefrom
hugh
saw
a
flat
of
cluttered
green
beneath
the
further
bluffs
of
the
moreau
with
sinking
heart
he
paused
and
gazed
below
upon
the
goal
of
so
much
toil
and
pain
yon
green
had
seemed
a
paradise
to
gain
the
while
he
thirsted
where
the
lonely
butte
looked
far
and
saw
no
toothsome
herb
or
fruit
in
all
that
yellow
barren
dim
with
heat
but
now
the
wasting
body
cried
for
meat
and
sickness
was
upon
him
game
should
pass
nor
deign
to
fear
the
mighty
hunter
glass
but
curiously
sniffing
pause
to
stare
now
while
thus
musing
hugh
became
aware
of
some
low
murmur
phasic
and
profound
scarce
risen
o
er
the
border
line
of
sound
it
might
have
been
the
coursing
of
his
blood
or
thunder
heard
remotely
or
a
flood
flung
down
a
wooded
valley
far
away
yet
that
had
been
no
day
twould
frost
that
night
amid
the
thirsty
land
all
streams
ran
thin
and
when
he
pressed
a
hand
on
either
ear
the
world
seemed
very
still
the
channel
of
the
little
rill
here
fell
away
to
eastward
rising
rough
with
old
to
a
lofty
bluff
that
faced
the
river
with
a
yellow
wall
thereto
perplexed
hugh
set
about
to
crawl
nor
reached
the
summit
till
the
sun
was
low
in
the
level
glow
the
still
land
told
not
whence
the
murmur
grew
but
where
the
green
strip
melted
into
blue
far
down
the
winding
valley
of
the
stream
hugh
saw
what
seemed
the
tempest
of
a
dream
at
mimic
havoc
in
the
as
from
the
sweeping
of
gigantic
brooms
a
dust
cloud
deepened
down
the
dwindling
river
upon
the
distant
ran
a
shiver
and
huddled
thickets
writhed
as
in
a
gale
on
creeps
the
windless
tempest
up
the
vale
the
while
the
murmur
deepens
to
a
roar
as
with
the
wider
yawning
of
a
door
and
now
the
agitated
green
gloom
gapes
to
belch
a
flood
of
countless
dusky
shapes
that
mill
and
wrangle
in
a
turbid
migrating
myriads
of
the
buffalo
bound
for
the
winter
pastures
of
the
platte
exhausted
faint
with
need
of
meat
hugh
sat
and
watched
the
mounting
of
the
living
flood
down
came
the
night
and
like
a
blot
of
blood
the
lopped
moon
weltered
in
the
east
sleep
came
and
gave
a
barmecidal
feast
about
a
merry
flame
were
simmering
sweet
haunches
of
the
calving
of
the
spring
and
tender
tongues
that
never
tasted
snow
and
marrow
bones
that
yielded
to
a
blow
such
treasure
hugh
awoke
with
gnashing
teeth
and
heard
the
mooing
drone
of
cows
beneath
the
roll
of
hoofs
the
challenge
of
the
bull
so
sounds
a
freshet
when
the
banks
are
full
and
bursting
bellow
to
the
croon
of
water
through
green
leaves
the
ragged
moon
now
drenched
the
valley
in
an
eerie
rain
below
the
semblance
of
a
hurricane
above
the
perfect
calm
of
brooding
frost
through
which
the
wolves
in
doleful
tenson
tossed
from
hill
to
hill
the
ancient
in
broken
sleep
hugh
rolled
the
chill
night
long
half
conscious
of
the
flowing
flesh
below
and
now
he
trailed
a
bison
in
the
snow
that
deepened
till
he
could
not
lift
his
feet
again
he
battled
for
a
chunk
of
meat
with
some
gray
beast
that
fought
with
icy
fang
and
when
he
woke
the
wolves
no
longer
sang
white
dawn
athwart
a
white
world
smote
the
hill
and
thunder
rolled
along
the
valley
still
morn
wiping
up
the
frost
as
with
a
sponge
day
on
the
steep
and
down
the
nightward
plunge
and
twilight
saw
the
myriads
moving
on
dust
to
the
westward
where
the
van
had
gone
and
dust
and
muffled
thunder
in
the
east
hugh
starved
while
gazing
on
a
titan
feast
the
tons
of
beef
that
eddied
there
and
swirled
had
stilled
the
crying
hungers
of
the
world
yet
not
one
little
morsel
was
for
him
the
red
sun
pausing
on
the
dusty
rim
induced
a
panic
aspect
of
his
plight
the
herd
would
pass
and
vanish
in
the
night
and
be
another
dream
to
cling
and
flout
now
scanning
all
the
summit
round
about
amid
the
rubble
of
the
ancient
drift
he
saw
a
bowlder
twas
too
big
to
lift
yet
he
might
roll
it
painfully
and
slow
he
worked
it
to
the
edge
then
let
it
go
and
breathlessly
expectant
watched
it
fall
it
hurtled
down
the
leaning
yellow
wall
and
bounding
from
a
brushy
ledge
s
brow
it
barely
grazed
the
buttocks
of
a
cow
and
made
a
moment
s
eddy
where
it
struck
in
peevish
wrath
hugh
cursed
his
evil
luck
and
seizing
rubble
gave
his
fury
vent
by
pelting
bison
till
his
strength
was
spent
so
might
a
child
assail
the
crowding
sea
then
sick
at
heart
and
musing
bitterly
he
shambled
down
the
steep
way
to
the
creek
and
having
stayed
the
tearing
buzzard
beak
with
breadroot
and
the
waters
of
the
rill
slept
till
the
white
of
morning
o
er
the
hill
was
like
a
whisper
groping
in
a
hush
the
stream
s
low
trill
seemed
loud
the
tumbled
brush
and
rumpled
in
the
flat
below
upon
a
fog
that
clung
like
spectral
snow
lay
motionless
nor
any
sound
was
there
no
frost
had
fallen
but
the
crystal
air
smacked
of
the
autumn
and
a
heavy
dew
lay
hoar
upon
the
grass
there
came
on
hugh
a
picture
vivid
in
the
moment
s
thrill
of
martialed
marching
up
a
hill
and
spiked
fields
dotted
with
the
pumpkin
s
gold
it
vanished
and
with
the
cold
he
brooded
on
the
mockeries
of
chance
the
shrewd
malignity
of
circumstance
that
either
gave
too
little
or
too
much
yet
with
the
fragment
of
a
hope
for
crutch
his
spirit
rallied
and
he
rose
to
go
though
each
stiff
joint
resisted
as
a
foe
and
that
old
battled
with
his
will
so
down
along
the
channel
of
the
rill
unto
the
vale
below
he
fought
his
way
the
frore
fog
rifting
in
the
risen
day
revealed
the
havoc
of
the
living
the
river
shallows
beaten
into
mud
the
slender
saplings
shattered
in
the
crush
all
lower
leafage
stripped
the
tousled
brush
despoiled
of
fruitage
aghast
and
where
the
avalanche
of
hoofs
had
passed
it
seemed
nor
herb
nor
grass
had
ever
been
and
this
the
paradise
wherein
a
plethora
of
food
had
come
to
make
a
starving
solitude
yet
hope
and
courage
mounted
with
the
sun
surely
hugh
thought
some
one
of
all
that
striving
mass
had
lost
the
strife
and
perished
in
the
headlong
stream
of
a
feast
to
fill
the
bellies
of
the
strong
that
still
the
weak
might
perish
all
day
long
he
struggled
down
the
stricken
vale
nor
saw
what
thing
he
sought
but
when
the
twilight
awe
was
creeping
in
beyond
a
bend
arose
a
din
as
though
the
kiotes
and
the
crows
fought
there
with
shrill
and
raucous
battle
cries
small
need
had
hugh
to
ponder
and
surmise
what
guerdon
beak
and
fang
contended
for
within
himself
the
oldest
cause
of
war
brought
forth
upon
the
instant
fang
and
beak
he
too
would
fight
nor
had
he
far
to
seek
amid
the
driftwood
strewn
about
the
sand
for
weapons
suited
to
a
brawny
hand
with
such
a
purpose
armed
with
club
and
stone
he
forged
ahead
into
the
battle
zone
and
from
a
screening
thicket
spied
his
foes
he
saw
a
bison
carcass
black
with
crows
and
over
it
a
welter
of
black
wings
and
round
about
a
press
of
tawny
rings
that
like
a
muddy
current
churned
to
foam
upon
a
snag
flashed
whitely
in
the
gloam
with
naked
teeth
while
close
about
the
prize
red
beaks
and
muzzles
bloody
to
the
eyes
betrayed
how
worth
a
struggle
was
the
feast
then
came
on
hugh
the
fury
of
the
to
eat
or
to
be
eaten
better
so
to
die
contending
with
a
living
foe
than
fight
the
yielding
distance
and
the
lack
masked
by
the
brush
he
opened
the
attack
and
ever
where
a
stone
or
club
fell
true
about
the
stricken
one
an
uproar
grew
and
brute
tore
brute
forgetful
of
the
prey
until
the
whole
pack
tumbled
in
the
fray
with
bleeding
flanks
and
lacerated
throats
then
as
the
leader
of
a
host
who
notes
the
confusion
of
the
foe
hugh
seized
the
moment
for
a
daring
blow
the
wolf
s
a
coward
who
in
goodly
packs
may
counterfeit
the
courage
that
he
lacks
and
with
a
craven
s
fury
crush
the
bold
but
when
the
disunited
mass
that
rolled
in
suicidal
strife
became
aware
how
some
great
beast
that
shambled
like
a
bear
bore
down
with
roaring
challenge
fell
a
hush
upon
the
pack
some
slinking
to
the
brush
with
tails
while
some
that
whined
in
pain
writhed
off
on
reddened
trails
with
bristled
mane
before
the
flying
stones
a
bolder
few
snarled
menace
at
the
foe
as
they
withdrew
to
fill
the
outer
dusk
with
clamorings
aloft
upon
a
moaning
wind
of
wings
the
crows
with
harsh
vituperative
cries
now
saw
a
gray
wolf
of
prodigious
size
devouring
with
the
frenzy
of
the
starved
thus
fell
to
hugh
a
bison
killed
and
carved
and
so
fate
s
whims
mysteriously
woe
in
the
silken
meshes
of
the
friend
weal
in
the
might
and
menace
of
the
foe
but
with
the
fading
of
the
afterglow
the
routed
wolves
found
courage
to
return
amid
the
brush
hugh
saw
their
burn
and
well
he
knew
how
futile
stick
and
stone
should
prove
by
night
to
keep
them
from
their
own
better
is
less
with
safety
than
enough
with
ruin
he
retreated
to
a
bluff
and
scarce
had
reached
it
when
the
pack
swooped
in
upon
the
carcass
all
night
long
the
din
of
wrangling
wolves
assailed
the
starry
air
while
high
above
them
in
a
brushy
lair
hugh
dreamed
of
gnawing
at
the
bloody
feast
along
about
the
blanching
of
the
east
when
sleep
is
weirdest
and
a
moment
s
flight
remembered
coextensive
with
the
night
may
teem
with
hapful
years
as
light
in
smoke
upon
the
jumble
of
hugh
s
dreaming
broke
a
buzz
of
human
voices
once
again
he
rode
the
westward
trail
with
henry
s
leagues
consuming
in
a
dust
and
now
the
nightmare
of
that
broken
trust
was
on
him
and
he
lay
beside
the
spring
a
corpse
yet
heard
the
muffled
parleying
above
him
of
the
looters
of
the
dead
but
when
he
might
have
riddled
what
they
said
the
babble
flattened
to
a
blur
of
and
lo
upon
a
bleak
frontier
of
day
the
spent
moon
staring
down
a
little
space
hugh
scrutinized
the
featureless
white
face
as
though
twould
speak
but
when
again
the
sound
grew
up
and
seemed
to
come
from
under
ground
he
cast
the
drowse
and
peering
down
the
slope
beheld
what
set
at
grapple
fear
and
three
indian
horsemen
riding
at
a
jog
their
ponies
wading
in
fog
that
clung
along
the
valley
seemed
to
swim
and
through
a
thinner
vapor
moving
dim
the
men
were
could
they
be
the
sioux
almost
the
wish
became
belief
in
hugh
or
were
they
rees
as
readily
the
doubt
withheld
him
from
the
hazard
of
a
shout
and
while
he
followed
them
with
baffled
gaze
grown
large
and
vague
dissolving
in
the
haze
they
vanished
westward
knowing
well
the
wont
of
indians
moving
on
the
forthwith
hugh
guessed
the
early
riders
were
the
outflung
feelers
of
a
tribe
like
some
huge
cat
gone
mousing
so
he
lay
concealed
impatient
with
the
sleepy
day
that
dawdled
in
the
dawning
would
it
bring
good
luck
or
ill
his
eager
questioning
as
crawling
fog
took
on
a
golden
hue
from
sunrise
he
was
waiting
for
the
sioux
their
parfleche
panniers
fat
with
maize
and
wasna
from
the
mint
of
evil
days
he
would
coin
tales
and
be
no
begging
guest
about
the
tribal
burning
west
but
kinsman
of
the
blood
of
daring
men
and
when
the
crawler
stood
erect
o
at
the
big
horn
s
mouth
beware
of
someone
riding
from
the
south
to
do
the
deed
that
he
had
lived
to
do
now
when
the
sun
stood
in
the
blue
from
where
a
cloud
of
startled
blackbirds
rose
down
stream
a
panic
tumult
broke
the
doze
of
windless
morning
what
unwelcome
news
embroiled
the
parliament
of
feathered
shrews
a
boiling
cloud
against
the
sun
they
lower
flackering
strepent
now
a
sooty
shower
westward
down
they
flutter
to
set
a
clump
of
cottonwoods
with
cold
black
fire
and
once
again
some
shock
of
sight
or
sound
flings
panic
in
the
gray
boughs
exploding
in
a
ruck
of
birds
what
augury
in
orniscopic
words
did
yon
swart
sibyls
on
the
morning
scrawl
now
broke
abruptly
through
the
clacking
brawl
a
s
barking
and
a
pony
s
neigh
whereat
a
running
nicker
fled
away
attenuating
to
a
rearward
hush
and
lo
in
hailing
distance
round
the
brush
that
fringed
a
jutting
bluff
s
base
like
a
beard
upon
a
stubborn
chin
appeared
a
band
of
mounted
warriors
in
their
van
aloof
and
lonely
rode
a
gnarled
old
man
upon
a
piebald
stallion
stooped
was
he
beneath
his
heavy
years
yet
haughtily
he
wore
them
like
the
purple
of
a
king
keen
for
a
goal
as
from
the
driving
string
a
barbed
and
feathered
arrow
truly
sped
his
face
was
like
a
flinty
and
brooded
westward
in
a
steady
stare
there
was
a
sift
of
winter
in
his
hair
the
bleakness
of
brown
winter
in
his
look
hugh
saw
and
huddled
closer
in
his
nook
fled
the
bright
dreams
of
safety
feast
and
rest
before
that
keen
cold
brooder
on
the
west
as
gaudy
leaves
before
the
blizzard
flee
twas
elk
tongue
fighting
chieftain
of
the
ree
with
all
his
people
at
his
pony
s
full
lodges
emptied
on
the
trail
of
hunger
on
they
came
in
ravelled
rank
and
many
a
haggard
eye
and
hollow
flank
made
plain
how
close
and
pitilessly
pressed
the
enemy
that
drove
them
to
the
such
foeman
as
no
warrior
ever
slew
a
tale
of
cornfields
plundered
by
the
sioux
their
sagging
panniers
told
yet
rich
enough
they
seemed
to
him
who
watched
them
from
the
bluff
yea
pampered
nigh
the
limit
of
desire
no
friend
had
filched
from
them
the
boon
of
fire
and
hurled
them
shivering
back
upon
the
beast
erect
they
went
to
strive
at
least
and
nightly
in
a
cozy
hope
fed
them
with
a
dream
of
buffalo
soon
to
be
overtaken
after
that
home
with
their
pawnee
cousins
on
the
platte
much
meat
and
till
the
spring
on
dragged
the
rabble
like
a
fraying
string
too
tautly
drawn
the
rode
for
much
is
light
and
little
is
a
load
among
all
heathen
with
no
christ
to
save
gray
seekers
for
the
yet
begrudging
grave
bent
with
the
hoeing
of
forgotten
maize
all
their
days
toiled
neath
the
hoarding
of
their
packs
and
nursing
squaws
their
babies
at
their
backs
whining
because
the
milk
they
got
was
thinned
in
dugs
of
famine
strove
as
with
a
wind
invincibly
equipped
with
their
first
bows
the
striplings
strutted
knowing
as
youth
knows
how
fair
life
is
beyond
the
beckoning
blue
the
grandsires
plodded
for
they
knew
as
frosted
heads
may
know
how
all
trails
merge
in
what
lone
land
raw
maidens
on
the
verge
of
some
mystery
of
life
in
wistful
emulation
of
the
wife
stooped
to
the
fancied
burden
of
the
race
nor
read
upon
the
withered
granddam
s
face
the
scrawled
tale
of
that
burden
and
its
woe
slant
to
the
sagging
poles
of
the
travaux
numb
to
the
squaw
s
harsh
railing
and
the
goad
the
lean
cayuses
toiled
and
children
rode
the
household
plunder
to
see
a
world
flow
by
on
either
side
from
blue
air
sprung
to
vanish
in
blue
air
a
river
of
enchantments
here
and
there
the
loped
upon
a
vexing
quest
where
countless
hoofs
had
left
a
palimpsest
a
taunting
snarl
of
broken
scents
and
now
they
sniff
the
clean
bones
of
the
bison
cow
howl
to
the
skies
and
now
with
manes
they
nose
the
leading
to
the
bluff
pause
puzzled
at
the
base
and
sweep
the
height
with
questioning
yelps
aloft
crouched
low
in
fright
already
hugh
can
hear
the
braves
guffaws
at
their
scorned
foeman
yielded
to
the
squaws
inverted
mercy
and
a
grave
since
earth
s
first
mother
scolded
from
a
cave
and
that
dear
riddle
of
her
love
began
no
man
has
wrought
a
weapon
against
man
to
match
the
deadly
venom
brewed
above
the
lean
blue
blinding
of
her
love
well
might
the
hunted
hunter
shrink
aghast
but
thrice
three
seasons
yet
should
swell
the
past
so
was
it
writ
ere
fate
s
keen
harriers
should
run
hugh
glass
to
earth
the
hungry
curs
took
up
again
the
tangled
scent
of
food
still
flowed
the
rabble
through
the
a
thinning
stream
now
of
the
halt
the
weak
and
all
who
had
not
very
far
to
seek
for
that
weird
pass
whereto
the
fleet
are
slow
and
out
of
it
keen
winds
and
numbing
blow
shrill
with
the
fleeing
voices
of
the
dead
slowly
the
scattered
stragglers
making
head
against
their
weariness
as
up
a
steep
fled
westward
and
the
morning
lay
asleep
upon
the
valley
fallen
wondrous
still
hugh
kept
his
nook
nor
ventured
forth
until
the
high
day
toppled
to
the
blue
descent
when
thirst
became
a
master
and
he
went
with
painful
scrambling
down
the
broken
scarp
lured
by
the
stream
that
like
a
smitten
harp
rippled
a
muted
music
to
the
sun
scarce
had
he
crossed
the
open
flat
and
won
the
fringe
of
willows
when
he
saw
slow
plodding
up
the
trail
a
tottering
squaw
whose
years
made
big
the
little
pack
she
bore
crouched
in
the
brush
hugh
watched
her
more
and
more
the
little
burden
tempted
him
why
not
a
thin
cry
throttled
in
that
lonely
spot
could
bring
no
succor
none
should
ever
know
save
him
the
feasted
kiote
and
the
crow
why
one
poor
crone
found
not
the
midnight
fire
nor
would
the
vanguard
quick
with
young
desire
devouring
distance
westward
like
a
flame
regret
this
ash
dropped
rearward
on
she
came
staring
blankly
on
the
so
close
now
that
it
needed
but
a
hand
to
overthrow
her
aye
to
win
that
priceless
spoil
a
little
tent
of
skin
a
flint
and
steel
a
kettle
and
a
knife
what
did
the
dying
with
the
means
of
life
that
thus
the
should
suffer
lack
poised
for
the
lunge
what
whimsy
held
him
back
why
did
he
gaze
upon
the
passing
prize
nor
seize
it
did
some
gust
of
ghostly
cries
awaken
round
of
eld
of
the
babies
she
had
to
plead
for
pity
on
her
graveward
days
far
down
a
moment
s
cleavage
in
the
haze
of
backward
years
hugh
saw
her
saw
the
little
burden
and
the
feeble
squaw
but
someone
sitting
haloed
like
a
saint
beside
a
hearth
long
cold
the
dream
grew
faint
and
when
he
looked
again
the
crone
was
gone
beyond
a
clump
of
willow
crawling
on
he
reached
the
river
leaning
to
a
pool
calm
in
its
cup
of
sand
he
fool
a
wild
wry
mask
of
mirth
yet
grim
rose
there
to
claim
identity
with
him
and
ridicule
his
folly
pity
faugh
who
pitied
this
that
it
should
spare
a
squaw
spent
in
the
spawning
of
a
scorpion
brood
he
drank
and
hastened
down
the
solitude
fleeing
that
thing
which
fleered
him
and
was
hugh
and
as
he
went
his
grew
and
with
it
anger
till
it
came
to
seem
that
somehow
some
sly
jamie
of
a
dream
had
plundered
him
again
and
he
was
strong
with
lust
of
vengeance
and
the
sting
of
wrong
so
that
he
travelled
faster
than
for
days
now
when
the
eve
in
grays
wove
the
day
s
shroud
and
through
the
lower
lands
lean
groped
with
chilling
spirit
hands
hugh
paused
perplexed
elusive
haunting
dim
as
though
some
memory
that
stirred
in
him
invasive
of
the
real
outgrew
the
dream
there
came
upon
the
breeze
that
stole
up
stream
a
whiff
of
woodsmoke
twixt
a
beat
and
beat
of
hugh
s
deluded
heart
it
seemed
the
sweet
allure
of
brief
way
and
one
came
upon
the
clearing
where
the
sumach
flame
ran
round
the
and
just
beyond
one
saw
the
slough
grass
nodding
in
the
pond
unto
the
sleepy
troll
the
bullfrogs
sung
and
then
one
saw
the
place
where
one
was
the
sitting
on
a
stumpy
rise
within
its
windows
were
as
eyes
that
love
much
and
are
faded
with
old
tears
it
seemed
regretful
of
a
life
s
arrears
yet
patient
with
a
poise
like
some
old
mother
for
her
bearded
boys
waiting
and
a
little
so
briefly
dreamed
a
recrudescent
lad
beneath
gray
hairs
and
fled
through
chill
and
damp
still
groped
the
odor
hinting
at
a
camp
a
herald
wooing
hope
and
fear
was
hospitality
or
danger
near
a
sioux
hot
upon
the
trail
or
laggard
rees
hugh
crawled
across
the
vale
toiled
up
along
a
zigzag
gully
s
bed
and
reached
a
bluff
s
top
in
a
smudge
of
red
the
west
burned
low
hill
summits
yet
alight
and
pools
of
gloom
anticipating
night
mottled
the
landscape
to
the
dull
blue
rim
what
freak
of
fancy
had
imposed
on
him
could
one
smell
fifty
years
away
he
saw
no
fire
no
pluming
spire
of
gray
rose
in
the
dimming
air
to
woo
or
warn
he
lay
upon
the
bare
height
fagged
forlorn
and
old
times
came
upon
him
with
the
creep
of
subtle
drugs
that
put
the
will
to
sleep
and
wreak
doom
to
the
soothing
of
a
dream
so
listlessly
he
scanned
the
sombrous
stream
scarce
seeing
what
he
scanned
the
dark
increased
a
chill
wind
wakened
from
the
frowning
east
and
soughed
along
the
vale
then
with
a
start
he
saw
what
broke
the
torpor
of
his
heart
and
set
the
wild
blood
free
from
where
he
lay
an
easy
away
appeared
a
mystic
germinating
spark
that
in
some
secret
garden
of
the
dark
upreared
a
frail
blue
nodding
stem
whereon
a
ruddy
lily
was
gone
what
miracle
was
this
again
it
grew
the
scarlet
blossom
on
the
stem
of
blue
and
withered
back
again
into
the
night
with
pounding
heart
hugh
crawled
along
the
height
and
reached
a
point
of
vantage
whence
below
he
saw
capricious
dim
and
glow
like
embers
quickened
in
a
breeze
twas
surely
not
a
camp
of
laggard
rees
nor
yet
of
siouan
warriors
hot
in
chase
dusk
and
a
quiet
bivouacked
in
that
place
a
doddering
vagrant
with
numb
hands
the
wind
fumbled
the
dying
ashes
there
and
whined
it
was
the
of
the
foe
now
hugh
gained
the
vale
below
keen
to
possess
once
more
the
ancient
gift
nearing
the
glow
he
saw
vague
shadows
lift
out
of
the
painted
gloom
of
smouldering
distorted
bulks
that
bristled
and
were
dogs
snarling
at
this
invasion
of
their
lair
hugh
charged
upon
them
growling
like
a
bear
and
sent
them
whining
now
again
to
view
the
burgeoning
of
scarlet
gold
and
blue
the
immemorial
miracle
of
fire
from
twigs
a
tenuous
smoky
spire
arose
and
made
an
altar
of
the
place
the
faint
upon
the
grizzled
face
transformed
the
kneeling
outcast
to
a
priest
and
native
of
the
east
the
wind
became
a
chanting
acolyte
these
two
entempled
in
the
vaulted
night
breathed
conjuries
of
interwoven
breath
then
hark
snapping
of
the
chains
of
death
from
dead
wood
lo
epiphanic
god
once
more
the
freightage
of
the
fennel
rod
dissolved
the
chilling
pall
of
jovian
scorn
the
wonder
of
the
resurrection
morn
the
face
apocalyptic
and
the
sword
the
glory
of
the
lord
hugh
lifting
up
his
eyes
about
him
saw
and
something
in
him
like
a
vernal
thaw
voiced
with
the
sound
of
many
waters
ran
and
quickened
to
the
laughter
of
a
man
he
fed
the
singing
flame
and
took
its
blessing
till
a
soft
sleep
came
with
dreaming
that
was
like
a
pleasant
tale
the
far
white
dawn
was
peering
up
the
vale
when
he
awoke
to
indolent
content
a
few
shorn
stars
in
pale
astonishment
were
huddled
westward
and
the
fire
was
low
three
scrawny
mustered
in
a
row
beyond
the
heap
of
embers
heads
askew
ears
pricked
to
question
what
the
man
might
do
sat
wistfully
regardant
he
arose
and
they
grown
canny
in
a
school
of
blows
skulked
to
a
safer
distance
there
to
raise
a
dolorous
chanting
of
the
evil
days
their
gray
breath
like
the
body
of
a
prayer
hugh
nursed
the
sullen
embers
to
a
flare
then
set
about
to
view
an
empty
camp
as
once
before
but
now
no
smoky
lamp
of
blear
suspicion
searched
a
gloom
of
fraud
wherein
a
smirking
friendship
like
a
bawd
embraced
a
coward
safety
now
no
grief
twixt
hideous
revelation
and
belief
made
womanish
the
man
but
glad
to
strive
with
hope
to
nerve
him
and
a
will
to
drive
he
knew
that
he
could
finish
in
the
race
the
staring
impassivity
of
space
no
longer
mocked
the
dreadful
skyward
climb
where
distance
seemed
identical
with
time
was
past
now
and
that
mystic
something
luck
without
which
worth
may
flounder
in
the
ruck
had
turned
to
him
again
so
flamelike
soared
rekindled
hope
in
him
as
he
explored
among
the
and
the
lean
dogs
ran
and
barked
about
him
for
the
love
of
man
wistful
yet
fearing
surely
he
could
find
some
trifle
in
the
hurry
left
or
haply
hidden
in
the
trampled
that
to
the
cunning
of
a
needy
hand
should
prove
the
of
circumstance
for
tis
the
little
gifts
of
grudging
chance
well
husbanded
make
victors
long
he
sought
without
avail
and
crawling
back
he
thought
of
how
the
dogs
were
growing
less
afraid
and
how
one
might
be
skinned
without
a
blade
a
flake
of
flint
might
do
it
he
would
try
and
then
he
did
the
servile
eye
trick
out
a
mental
image
like
the
real
he
saw
a
glimmering
of
whetted
steel
beside
a
heap
now
washed
with
morning
light
scarce
more
of
marvel
and
the
sense
of
might
moved
arthur
when
he
reached
a
hand
to
take
the
brand
emerging
from
the
lake
whereby
a
kingdom
should
be
lopped
of
strife
than
hugh
now
pouncing
on
a
trader
s
knife
worn
hollow
in
the
use
of
bounteous
days
and
now
behold
a
rich
man
by
the
blaze
of
his
own
lord
of
steel
and
fire
not
having
but
the
measure
of
desire
determines
wealth
who
gaining
more
seek
most
are
ever
the
pursuers
of
a
ghost
and
lend
their
fleetness
to
the
fugitive
for
hugh
long
goaded
by
the
wish
to
live
what
gage
of
mastery
in
fire
and
tool
that
twain
wherewith
time
put
the
brute
to
school
evolving
man
the
maker
and
the
seer
twixt
urging
hunger
and
restraining
fear
the
gaunt
dogs
hovered
round
the
man
while
he
cajoled
them
in
the
language
of
the
ree
and
simulated
feeding
them
with
sand
until
the
boldest
dared
to
sniff
his
hand
and
with
conciliative
whine
through
bristled
mane
the
quick
blade
bit
the
spine
below
the
skull
and
as
a
thing
the
body
humped
and
shuddered
withering
the
lank
limbs
huddled
wilted
now
to
skin
the
carcass
dig
a
hole
arrange
therein
and
fix
the
pelt
with
stakes
the
up
this
done
he
shaped
the
bladder
to
a
cup
on
willow
withes
and
filled
the
rawhide
pot
with
water
from
the
it
hot
with
roasted
stones
and
set
the
meat
those
days
of
famine
and
prodigious
toil
had
wrought
bulimic
cravings
in
the
man
and
scarce
the
cooking
of
the
flesh
outran
the
eating
of
it
as
a
fed
flame
towers
according
to
the
fuel
it
devours
his
hunger
with
indulgence
grew
nor
ceased
until
the
kettle
empty
of
the
feast
went
dim
the
sky
and
valley
merging
swirled
in
subtle
smoke
that
smothered
out
the
world
hugh
slept
and
divers
mounting
sunder
a
murmuring
murk
to
blink
in
sudden
wonder
upon
a
dazzling
upper
deep
of
he
rose
again
to
consciousness
and
knew
the
low
sun
beating
slantly
on
his
face
now
indolently
gazing
round
the
place
he
noted
how
the
curs
had
revelled
the
bones
and
entrails
gone
some
scattered
hair
alone
remaining
of
the
pot
of
hide
how
strange
he
had
not
heard
them
at
his
side
and
granting
but
one
afternoon
had
passed
what
could
have
made
the
fire
burn
out
so
fast
had
daylight
waned
night
fallen
morning
crept
noon
blazed
a
new
day
dwindled
while
he
slept
and
was
the
friendlike
fire
a
jamie
too
across
the
twilit
consciousness
of
hugh
the
old
obsession
like
a
wounded
bird
fluttered
he
got
upon
his
knees
and
stirred
the
feathery
ash
but
not
a
spark
was
there
already
with
the
failing
sun
the
air
went
keen
betokening
a
frosty
night
hugh
winced
with
something
like
the
clutch
of
fright
how
could
he
bear
the
torture
how
sustain
the
sting
of
that
antiquity
of
pain
rolled
back
upon
again
the
foe
that
yielding
victor
fleet
in
being
slow
that
huge
impersonal
malevolence
so
readily
the
tentacles
of
sense
root
in
the
larger
standard
of
desire
that
hugh
fell
farther
in
the
loss
of
fire
than
in
the
finding
of
it
he
arose
and
suddenly
the
place
grew
strange
as
grows
a
friend
s
house
when
the
friend
is
on
his
bier
and
all
that
was
familiar
there
and
dear
puts
on
a
blank
inhospitable
look
hugh
set
his
face
against
the
east
and
took
that
dreariest
of
ways
the
trail
of
flight
he
would
outcrawl
the
shadow
of
the
night
and
have
the
day
to
blanket
him
in
sleep
but
as
he
went
to
meet
the
gloom
bemused
with
life
s
irrational
rebuffs
a
yelping
of
the
dogs
among
the
bluffs
rose
stabbing
rent
the
pall
of
evening
silence
blunted
to
a
drawl
amid
the
arid
waterways
and
died
and
as
the
echo
to
the
sound
replied
so
in
the
troubled
mind
of
hugh
was
wrought
a
reminiscent
cry
of
thought
to
thought
that
groping
found
an
unlocked
door
to
life
the
flint
to
skin
the
knife
discovered
why
that
made
a
flint
and
steel
no
further
with
the
subtle
foe
at
heel
he
fled
for
all
about
him
in
the
rock
to
waken
when
the
needy
hand
might
knock
a
savior
slept
he
found
a
flake
of
flint
scraped
from
his
shirt
a
little
wad
of
lint
spilled
on
it
from
the
smitten
stone
a
shower
of
ruddy
seed
and
saw
the
mystic
flower
that
genders
its
own
summer
bloom
anew
and
so
capricious
luck
came
back
to
hugh
and
he
was
happier
than
he
had
been
since
jamie
to
that
unforgiven
sin
had
yielded
ages
back
upon
the
grand
now
he
would
turn
the
cunning
of
his
hand
to
carving
crutches
that
he
might
arise
be
manlike
lift
more
rapidly
the
skies
that
crouched
between
his
purpose
and
the
mark
the
warm
glow
housed
him
from
the
frosty
dark
and
there
he
wrought
in
very
joyous
mood
and
sang
by
the
solitude
set
laggard
singers
snatching
at
the
tune
the
gaunter
for
their
hunt
the
dogs
came
soon
to
haunt
the
shaken
fringes
of
the
glow
and
pitching
voices
to
the
timeless
woe
outwailed
the
lilting
so
the
chorus
sings
of
terror
pity
and
the
tears
of
things
when
most
the
doomed
protagonist
is
gay
the
stars
swarmed
over
and
the
front
of
day
whitened
above
a
white
world
and
the
sun
rose
on
a
sleeper
with
a
task
well
done
nor
roused
him
till
its
burning
topped
the
blue
when
hugh
awoke
there
woke
a
younger
hugh
now
half
a
stranger
and
twas
good
to
feel
with
ebbing
sleep
the
old
green
vigor
steal
thrilling
along
his
muscles
and
his
veins
as
in
a
lull
of
rains
the
gray
bough
quickens
to
the
sap
it
chanced
the
dogs
lay
near
him
sound
asleep
curled
nose
to
buttock
in
the
noonday
glow
he
killed
the
larger
with
a
blow
skinned
dressed
and
set
it
roasting
on
a
spit
and
when
twas
cooked
ate
sparingly
of
it
for
need
might
yet
make
little
seem
a
feast
fording
the
river
shallows
south
by
east
he
hobbled
now
along
a
withered
rill
that
issued
where
old
floods
had
gashed
the
a
cyclopean
portal
yawning
sheer
no
storm
of
countless
hoofs
had
entered
here
it
seemed
a
place
where
nothing
ever
comes
but
change
of
season
he
could
hear
the
plums
plash
in
the
frosted
thicket
while
like
a
spirit
lisping
in
the
hush
the
crisp
leaves
whispered
round
him
as
they
fell
and
ever
now
and
then
the
autumn
spell
was
broken
by
an
ululating
cry
from
where
far
back
with
muzzle
to
the
sky
the
lone
dog
followed
mourning
darkness
came
and
huddled
up
beside
a
cozy
flame
hugh
s
sleep
was
but
a
momentary
flight
across
a
little
shadow
into
light
so
day
on
day
he
toiled
and
when
afloat
above
the
sunset
like
a
stygian
boat
the
new
moon
bore
the
spectre
of
the
old
he
dwindling
strip
of
blue
the
valley
of
the
tortuous
cheyenne
and
ere
the
half
moon
sailed
the
night
again
those
far
lone
leagues
had
sloughed
their
garb
of
blue
and
dwindled
dwindled
dwindled
after
hugh
until
he
saw
that
titan
of
the
plains
the
sinewy
missouri
dearth
of
rains
had
made
the
giant
gaunt
as
he
who
saw
this
loud
of
a
late
march
thaw
seemed
never
to
have
bellowed
at
his
banks
and
yet
with
staring
ribs
and
hollow
flanks
the
urge
of
an
indomitable
will
proclaimed
him
of
the
breed
of
giants
still
and
where
the
current
ran
a
boiling
track
twas
like
the
muscles
of
a
mighty
back
grown
atlantean
in
the
wrestler
s
craft
hugh
set
to
work
and
built
a
little
raft
of
driftwood
bound
with
grapevines
so
it
fell
that
one
with
an
amazing
tale
to
tell
came
drifting
to
the
gates
of
kiowa
iv
the
return
of
the
ghost
not
long
hugh
let
the
lust
of
vengeance
gnaw
upon
him
idling
though
the
tale
he
told
and
what
report
proclaimed
him
were
as
gold
to
buy
a
winter
s
comfort
at
the
post
i
can
not
rest
for
i
am
but
the
ghost
of
someone
murdered
by
a
friend
he
said
so
long
as
yonder
traitor
thinks
me
dead
aye
buried
in
the
bellies
of
the
crows
and
kiotes
whereupon
said
one
of
those
who
heard
him
noting
how
the
old
man
shook
as
with
a
chill
god
fend
that
one
should
look
with
such
a
blizzard
of
a
face
for
me
for
he
went
grayer
like
a
poplar
tree
that
shivers
ruffling
to
the
first
faint
breath
of
storm
while
yet
the
world
is
still
as
death
save
where
far
off
the
kenneled
thunders
bay
so
brooding
he
grew
stronger
day
by
day
until
at
last
he
laid
the
crutches
by
and
then
one
evening
came
a
rousing
cry
from
where
the
year
s
last
keelboat
hove
in
view
around
the
bend
its
swarthy
sweating
crew
slant
to
the
shouldered
line
men
sang
that
night
in
kiowa
and
by
the
ruddy
light
of
leaping
fires
amid
the
wooden
walls
the
cups
went
round
and
there
were
merry
brawls
of
bearded
lads
no
older
for
the
beard
and
laughing
stories
vied
with
tales
of
weird
by
stream
and
prairie
trail
and
mountain
pass
until
the
tipsy
bourgeois
bawled
for
glass
to
shame
these
with
a
man
s
tale
fit
to
the
graybeard
sitting
where
the
light
was
blear
with
little
heart
for
revelry
began
his
story
told
as
of
another
man
who
loving
late
loved
much
and
was
betrayed
he
spoke
unwitting
how
his
passion
played
upon
them
how
their
eyes
grew
soft
or
hard
with
what
he
told
yet
something
of
the
bard
he
seemed
and
his
the
purpose
that
is
art
s
whereby
men
make
a
vintage
of
their
hearts
and
with
the
wine
of
beauty
deaden
pain
insistent
as
october
rain
his
voice
beat
on
and
now
and
then
would
flit
across
the
melancholy
gray
of
it
a
glimmer
of
cold
fire
that
like
the
flare
of
soundless
lightning
showed
a
world
made
bare
green
summer
slain
and
all
its
leafage
stripped
and
bronze
jaws
tightened
brawny
hands
were
gripped
as
though
each
hearer
had
a
fickle
friend
but
when
the
old
man
might
have
made
an
end
rounding
the
story
to
a
peaceful
close
at
kiowa
songlike
his
voice
arose
the
grinning
gray
mask
lifted
and
the
eyes
burned
as
a
bard
s
who
sees
and
prophesies
conning
the
future
as
a
time
long
gone
swaying
to
rhythm
the
dizzy
tale
plunged
on
even
to
the
cutting
of
the
traitor
s
throat
and
though
a
bloody
strangling
smote
the
voice
of
that
gray
chanter
drunk
with
doom
and
there
was
shuddering
in
the
gloom
of
fallen
fires
it
seemed
the
deed
was
done
before
their
eyes
who
heard
the
morrow
s
sun
low
over
leagues
of
plain
saw
glass
upon
his
pilgrimage
again
northbound
as
hunter
for
the
keelboat
s
crew
and
many
times
the
wide
autumnal
blue
burned
out
and
darkened
to
a
deep
of
stars
and
still
they
toiled
among
the
snags
and
those
lean
men
straining
at
the
rope
lashed
by
the
doubt
and
strengthened
by
the
hope
of
backward
wrought
of
bone
and
muscle
panting
for
the
yellowstone
bend
after
bend
and
yet
more
bends
away
now
was
the
river
like
a
sandy
bay
at
and
the
cutbank
s
boom
mocked
them
in
shallows
now
twas
like
a
flume
with
which
the
toilers
barely
creeping
strove
and
bend
by
bend
the
selfsame
poplar
grove
set
on
the
selfsame
headland
so
it
seemed
confronted
them
as
though
they
merely
dreamed
of
passing
one
drear
point
so
on
and
up
past
where
the
tawny
titan
gulps
the
cup
of
cheyenne
waters
past
the
moreau
s
mouth
and
still
wry
league
and
stubborn
league
fell
south
becoming
haze
and
weary
memory
then
past
the
empty
lodges
of
the
ree
that
gaped
at
cornfields
plundered
by
the
sioux
and
there
old
times
came
mightily
on
hugh
for
much
of
him
was
born
and
buried
there
some
troubled
glory
of
that
hair
was
on
the
trampled
corn
the
lonely
skies
so
haunted
with
the
blue
of
jamie
s
eyes
seemed
taunting
him
and
through
the
frosted
wood
along
the
flat
where
once
their
tent
had
stood
a
chill
wind
sorrowed
and
the
blackbirds
brawl
amid
the
funeral
torches
of
the
fall
ran
raucously
a
desecrating
din
past
where
the
cannon
ball
and
heart
come
in
they
labored
now
the
northwest
woke
at
last
the
gaunt
bluffs
bellowed
back
the
trumpet
blast
of
charging
winds
that
made
the
sandbars
smoke
to
breathe
now
was
to
gulp
fine
sand
and
choke
the
stinging
air
was
sibilant
with
whips
leaning
the
more
and
with
the
firmer
grips
still
northward
the
embattled
toilers
pressed
to
where
the
river
yaws
into
the
west
there
stood
the
mandan
village
now
began
the
chaining
of
the
titan
ran
the
wingéd
hounds
of
winter
ceased
to
bay
the
stupor
of
a
doom
completed
lay
upon
the
world
the
biting
darkness
fell
out
in
the
night
resounding
as
a
well
they
heard
the
popping
in
a
vise
of
frost
all
night
the
smithies
of
the
ice
reëchoed
with
the
griding
jar
and
clink
of
ghostly
hammers
welding
link
to
link
and
morning
found
the
world
without
a
sound
there
lay
the
stubborn
prairie
titan
bound
to
wait
the
heraclean
thaw
though
still
in
silent
rage
he
strove
to
gnaw
the
ragged
shackles
knitting
at
his
breast
and
so
the
boatman
won
a
winter
s
rest
among
the
mandan
traders
but
for
hugh
there
yet
remained
a
weary
work
to
do
across
the
naked
country
west
by
south
his
purpose
called
him
at
the
big
horn
s
three
hundred
miles
of
winging
for
the
crow
but
by
the
river
trail
that
he
must
go
twas
seven
hundred
winding
miles
at
least
so
now
he
turned
his
back
upon
the
feast
snug
ease
the
pleasant
tale
the
merry
mood
and
took
the
bare
solitude
northwestward
long
they
watched
him
from
the
post
skied
on
a
fading
like
a
ghost
at
gray
and
hooded
in
his
breath
he
seemed
indeed
a
fugitive
from
death
on
whom
some
tatter
of
the
shroud
still
clung
blank
space
engulfed
him
now
the
moon
was
young
when
he
set
forth
and
day
by
day
he
strode
his
scarce
healed
wounds
upon
him
like
a
load
and
dusk
by
dusk
his
fire
the
moon
that
waxed
until
it
wrought
a
spectral
noon
at
nightfall
then
he
came
to
where
awhirl
with
spring
s
wild
rage
the
titan
girl
a
skyey
wonder
on
her
virgin
face
receives
the
virile
yellowstone
s
embrace
and
bears
the
lusty
seeker
for
the
sea
a
bleak
serenity
clung
round
the
valley
where
the
twain
lay
dead
a
winding
sheet
was
on
the
marriage
bed
twas
warmer
now
the
sky
grew
overcast
and
as
hugh
strode
southwestward
all
the
vast
gray
void
seemed
suddenly
astir
with
wings
and
multitudinary
the
muffled
sibilance
of
tumbling
snow
it
seemed
no
more
might
living
waters
flow
moon
gleam
star
glint
dawn
smoulder
through
bird
sing
or
ever
any
fair
familiar
thing
be
so
again
the
outworn
winds
were
furled
weird
weavers
of
the
twilight
of
a
world
wrought
thread
on
kissing
thread
the
web
of
doom
grown
insubstantial
in
the
knitted
gloom
the
bluffs
loomed
eerie
and
the
scanty
trees
were
dwindled
to
remote
that
never
might
be
green
or
shield
a
nest
all
day
with
swinging
stride
hugh
forged
southwest
along
the
yellowstone
s
stream
a
moving
in
a
troubled
dream
and
all
day
long
the
whispering
weavers
wove
and
close
on
dark
he
came
to
where
a
grove
of
cottonwoods
rose
tall
and
against
the
northern
bluffs
he
camped
therein
and
with
cut
boughs
made
shelter
as
he
might
close
pressed
the
blackness
of
the
night
about
him
and
his
fire
of
plum
wood
purred
athwart
a
soft
penumbral
drowse
he
heard
the
tumbling
snowflakes
sighing
all
around
till
sleep
transformed
it
to
a
summer
sound
of
boyish
bees
the
southwind
in
the
tousled
apple
trees
and
slumber
flowing
from
their
leafy
gloom
he
wakened
to
the
cottonwoods
deep
boom
black
fury
was
the
world
the
northwest
s
roar
as
of
a
surf
upon
a
shipwreck
shore
plunged
high
above
him
from
the
sheer
bluff
s
verge
and
like
the
backward
sucking
of
the
surge
far
fled
the
sobbing
of
the
wild
black
blindness
grew
white
twas
day
all
being
now
seemed
narrowed
to
a
span
that
held
a
sputtering
wood
fire
and
a
man
beyond
was
tumult
and
a
whirling
maze
the
trees
were
but
a
roaring
in
a
haze
the
sheer
that
took
the
blizzard
s
charge
was
thunder
flung
along
the
hidden
marge
of
chaos
stridden
by
the
ghost
of
light
white
blindness
grew
black
twas
night
wherethrough
nor
moon
nor
any
star
might
grope
two
days
since
hugh
had
killed
an
antelope
and
what
remained
sufficed
the
time
of
storm
the
snow
banked
round
his
shelter
kept
him
warm
and
there
was
wood
to
burn
for
many
a
day
the
third
dawn
oozing
through
a
smudge
of
gray
awoke
him
it
was
growing
colder
fast
still
from
the
bluff
high
over
boomed
the
blast
but
now
it
took
the
void
with
numbing
wings
by
noon
the
woven
mystery
of
things
frayed
raggedly
and
through
a
sudden
rift
at
length
hugh
saw
the
beetling
lift
a
sturdy
shoulder
to
the
flying
rack
slowly
the
sense
of
distances
came
back
as
with
the
waning
day
the
great
wind
fell
the
pale
sun
set
upon
a
frozen
hell
the
wolves
howled
hugh
had
left
the
mandan
town
when
the
maiden
moon
lies
down
beside
the
sea
of
evening
now
she
rose
and
staring
blankly
on
the
snows
while
yet
the
twilight
tarried
in
the
west
and
more
and
more
she
came
a
tardy
guest
as
hugh
pushed
onward
through
the
frozen
waste
until
she
stole
on
midnight
a
haggard
spectre
then
no
more
appeared
twas
on
that
time
the
man
of
hoary
beard
paused
in
the
early
twilight
looming
lone
upon
a
of
the
yellowstone
and
peered
across
the
white
stream
to
the
south
where
in
the
flatland
at
the
big
horn
s
mouth
the
new
fort
stood
that
henry
s
men
had
built
what
perfect
peace
for
such
a
nest
of
guilt
what
satisfied
immunity
from
woe
yon
sprawling
shadow
pied
with
and
plumed
with
sparkling
woodsmoke
might
have
been
a
homestead
with
the
children
gathered
in
to
share
its
bounty
through
the
holidays
hugh
saw
their
faces
round
the
gay
the
hale
old
father
in
a
mood
for
yarns
or
boastful
of
the
plenty
of
his
barns
fruitage
of
honest
toil
and
grateful
lands
and
half
a
stranger
to
her
folded
hands
the
mother
with
october
in
her
hair
and
august
in
her
face
one
moment
there
hugh
saw
it
then
the
monstrous
brutal
fact
wiped
out
the
dream
and
goaded
him
to
act
though
now
to
act
seemed
strangely
like
a
dream
descending
from
the
bluff
he
crossed
the
stream
the
dry
snow
fifing
to
his
eager
stride
reaching
the
fort
stockade
he
paused
to
bide
the
passing
of
a
whimsy
was
it
true
or
was
this
but
the
fretted
wraith
of
hugh
whose
flesh
had
fed
the
kiotes
long
ago
still
through
a
chink
he
saw
the
so
like
an
eye
that
brazened
out
a
wrong
and
now
there
came
a
flight
of
muffled
song
the
rhythmic
thudding
of
a
booted
heel
that
timed
a
squeaking
fiddle
to
a
reel
how
swiftly
men
forget
the
spawning
earth
is
fat
with
graves
and
what
is
one
man
worth
that
fiddles
should
be
muted
at
his
fall
he
should
have
died
and
did
was
all
well
let
the
living
jig
it
he
would
turn
back
to
the
night
the
spacious
unconcern
of
wilderness
that
never
played
the
friend
now
came
the
song
and
fiddling
to
an
end
and
someone
laughed
within
the
old
man
winced
listened
with
bated
breath
and
was
convinced
twas
jamie
laughing
once
again
he
heard
joy
filled
a
hush
twixt
like
a
bird
then
like
a
famished
cat
his
lurking
hate
pounced
crushingly
he
found
the
outer
gate
beat
on
it
with
his
shoulder
raised
a
cry
no
doubt
twas
deemed
a
fitful
wind
went
by
none
stirred
but
when
he
did
not
cease
to
shout
a
door
creaked
open
and
a
man
came
out
amid
the
spilling
raised
the
wicket
in
the
outer
gate
and
gazed
one
moment
on
a
face
as
white
as
death
because
the
beard
was
thick
with
frosted
breath
made
mystic
by
the
stars
then
came
a
gasp
the
clatter
of
the
falling
wicket
s
hasp
the
crunch
of
panic
feet
along
the
snow
and
someone
stammered
huskily
and
low
my
god
i
saw
the
old
man
s
ghost
out
there
twas
spoken
as
one
speaks
who
feels
his
hair
prickle
the
scalp
and
then
another
it
seemed
like
henry
s
the
dead
are
dead
what
talk
is
this
le
bon
you
saw
him
die
who
s
there
hugh
strove
to
shout
to
give
the
lie
to
those
within
but
could
not
fetch
a
sound
just
so
he
dreamed
of
lying
under
ground
beside
the
grand
and
hearing
overhead
the
talk
of
men
or
was
he
really
dead
and
all
this
but
a
maggot
in
the
brain
then
suddenly
the
clatter
of
a
chain
aroused
him
and
he
saw
the
portal
yawn
and
saw
a
bright
rectangled
patch
of
dawn
as
through
a
grave
s
twas
candlelight
poured
through
the
open
doorway
on
the
night
and
those
were
men
before
him
bulking
black
against
the
glow
reality
flashed
back
he
strode
ahead
and
entered
at
the
door
a
falling
fiddle
jangled
on
the
floor
and
left
a
deathly
silence
on
his
bench
the
fiddler
shrank
a
row
of
eyes
with
terror
ran
about
the
naked
hall
and
there
was
one
who
huddled
by
the
wall
and
hid
his
face
and
shivered
for
a
spell
that
silence
clung
and
then
the
old
man
well
is
this
the
sort
of
welcome
that
i
get
twas
not
my
time
to
feed
the
kiotes
yet
put
on
the
pot
and
stew
a
chunk
of
meat
and
you
shall
see
how
much
a
ghost
can
eat
i
ve
journeyed
far
if
what
i
hear
be
true
now
in
that
none
might
doubt
the
voice
of
hugh
nor
yet
the
face
however
it
might
seem
a
blurred
reflection
in
a
flowing
stream
a
buzz
of
wonder
broke
the
trance
of
dread
good
god
the
major
gasped
we
thought
you
dead
two
men
have
testified
they
saw
you
die
if
they
speak
truth
hugh
answered
then
i
lie
both
here
and
by
the
grand
if
i
be
right
then
two
lie
here
and
shall
lie
from
this
night
which
are
they
henry
answered
yon
is
the
old
man
set
the
trigger
of
his
gun
and
gazed
on
jules
who
cowered
by
the
wall
eyes
blinked
expectant
of
the
hammer
s
fall
ears
strained
anticipative
of
the
roar
but
hugh
walked
leisurely
across
the
floor
and
kicked
the
croucher
saying
come
get
up
and
wag
your
tail
i
couldn
t
kill
a
pup
then
turning
round
i
had
a
faithful
friend
no
doubt
he
too
was
with
me
to
the
end
where
s
jamie
started
out
before
the
snows
for
v
jamie
the
country
of
the
crows
through
which
the
big
horn
and
the
rosebud
run
sees
over
mountain
peaks
the
setting
sun
and
southward
from
the
yellowstone
flung
wide
it
broadens
ever
to
the
morning
side
and
has
the
powder
on
its
vague
frontier
about
the
subtle
changing
of
the
year
ere
even
favored
valleys
felt
the
stir
of
spring
and
yet
expectancy
of
her
was
like
a
pleasant
rumor
all
repeat
yet
none
may
prove
the
sound
of
horses
feet
went
eastward
through
the
silence
of
that
land
for
then
it
was
there
rode
a
little
band
of
trappers
out
of
henry
s
post
to
bear
dispatches
down
to
atkinson
and
there
to
furnish
out
a
keelboat
for
the
horn
and
four
went
lightly
but
the
fifth
seemed
worn
as
with
a
heavy
heart
for
that
was
he
who
should
have
died
but
did
not
silently
he
heard
the
careless
parley
of
his
men
and
thought
of
how
the
spring
should
come
again
that
garish
strumpet
with
her
lure
to
waken
hope
where
nothing
may
endure
to
quicken
love
where
loving
is
betrayed
yet
now
and
then
some
dream
of
jamie
made
slow
music
in
him
for
a
little
while
and
they
who
rode
beside
him
saw
a
smile
glimmer
upon
that
ruined
face
of
gray
as
on
a
winter
fog
the
groping
day
pours
glory
through
a
momentary
rift
yet
never
did
the
gloom
that
bound
him
lift
he
seemed
as
one
who
feeds
upon
his
heart
and
finds
despite
the
bitter
and
the
smart
a
little
sweetness
and
is
glad
for
that
now
up
the
powder
striking
for
the
platte
across
the
bleak
divide
the
horsemen
went
attained
that
river
where
its
course
is
bent
from
north
to
east
and
spurring
on
apace
along
the
wintry
valley
reached
the
place
where
from
the
west
flows
in
the
laramie
thence
fearing
to
encounter
with
the
ree
they
headed
eastward
through
the
barren
land
to
where
down
a
track
of
sand
the
niobrara
races
for
the
a
runner
here
at
length
was
born
upon
the
southern
slopes
the
baby
spring
a
timid
fretful
thing
at
the
winter
s
withered
paps
not
such
as
when
announced
by
and
ringed
with
swords
of
lightning
she
would
ride
the
haughty
victrix
and
the
mystic
bride
clad
splendidly
as
never
sheba
s
queen
before
her
marching
multitudes
of
green
in
triumph
grudging
slow
amid
the
fraying
fringes
of
the
snow
the
sprouted
and
the
air
was
chill
along
the
northern
slopes
twas
winter
still
and
no
root
dreamed
what
was
nurtured
now
in
some
bleak
nazareth
beyond
the
crest
to
sunward
on
they
spurred
through
vacancies
that
waited
for
the
bird
and
everywhere
the
odic
presence
dwelt
the
southwest
blew
the
snow
began
to
melt
and
when
they
reached
the
valley
of
the
snake
the
niobrara
s
ice
began
to
break
and
all
night
long
and
all
day
long
it
made
a
sound
as
of
a
random
cannonade
with
rifles
snarling
down
a
skirmish
line
the
geese
went
over
every
tree
and
vine
was
dotted
thick
with
when
they
saw
the
little
river
of
keyapaha
grown
mighty
for
the
moment
then
they
came
one
evening
when
all
thickets
were
aflame
with
pale
green
and
the
windflowers
blew
to
where
the
headlong
niobrara
threw
his
speed
against
the
swoln
missouri
s
flank
and
hurled
him
roaring
to
the
further
a
giant
staggered
by
a
pigmy
s
sling
thence
plunging
ever
deeper
into
spring
across
the
greening
prairie
east
by
south
they
rode
and
just
above
the
platte
s
wide
mouth
came
weary
with
the
trail
to
atkinson
there
all
the
vernal
was
done
no
heart
might
find
aught
lacking
there
the
dove
s
call
wandered
in
the
drowsy
air
a
brooded
in
the
lucent
haze
priapic
revellers
the
shrieking
jays
held
mystic
worship
in
the
secret
shade
woodpeckers
briskly
plied
their
noisy
trade
along
the
and
their
scarlet
hoods
flashed
flamelike
in
the
smoky
cottonwoods
what
lacked
not
sweetness
in
the
breeze
the
plum
bloom
murmurous
with
bumblebees
was
drifted
deep
in
every
draw
and
slough
not
color
witcheries
of
gold
and
blue
the
dandelion
and
the
violet
wove
in
the
green
might
not
the
sad
forget
the
happy
here
have
nothing
more
to
seek
lo
yonder
by
that
pleasant
little
creek
how
one
might
loll
upon
the
grass
and
fish
and
build
the
temple
of
one
s
wildest
wish
twixt
nibbles
surely
there
was
quite
enough
of
and
of
to
rear
it
nobly
to
the
roof
yet
there
was
one
whose
spirit
stood
aloof
from
all
this
gray
old
man
no
nearer
now
than
when
the
quest
began
to
what
he
sought
on
that
long
winter
trail
aye
jamie
had
been
there
but
when
the
tale
that
roving
trappers
brought
from
kiowa
was
told
to
him
he
seemed
as
one
who
saw
a
ghost
and
could
but
stare
on
it
they
said
until
one
day
he
mounted
horse
and
fled
into
the
north
a
man
i
ve
got
to
go
and
find
him
if
i
can
was
all
he
said
for
days
before
he
left
and
what
of
hugh
so
long
of
love
bereft
so
long
sustained
and
driven
by
his
hate
a
touch
of
ruth
now
made
him
desolate
no
longer
eager
to
avenge
the
wrong
with
not
enough
of
pity
to
be
strong
and
just
enough
of
love
to
choke
and
sting
a
gray
old
hulk
amid
the
surge
of
spring
he
floundered
on
a
of
the
heart
but
when
the
boat
was
ready
for
the
start
up
the
long
watery
stairway
to
the
horn
hugh
joined
the
party
and
the
year
was
shorn
of
blooming
girlhood
as
they
forged
amain
into
the
north
the
late
plain
grew
sallow
and
the
ruthless
golden
shower
of
summer
wrought
in
lust
upon
the
flower
that
withered
in
the
endless
martyrdom
to
seed
the
scarlet
quickened
on
the
plum
about
the
heart
s
mouth
when
they
came
thereto
among
the
mandans
grapes
were
turning
blue
and
they
were
purple
at
the
yellowstone
a
frosted
standing
out
alone
upon
a
barren
bluff
top
gazing
far
above
the
crossing
at
the
powder
s
bar
was
spattered
with
the
blood
of
summer
slain
so
it
was
autumn
in
the
world
again
and
all
those
months
of
toil
had
yielded
nought
to
hugh
how
often
is
the
seeker
sought
by
what
he
blind
game
for
always
had
the
answer
been
the
same
from
roving
trapper
and
at
trading
post
aye
one
who
seemed
to
stare
upon
a
ghost
and
followed
where
it
led
had
gone
that
way
in
search
of
hugh
they
a
haggard
chap
and
often
had
the
old
man
thought
mayhap
he
ll
be
at
henry
s
post
and
we
shall
meet
and
to
forgive
and
to
forget
were
sweet
tis
for
its
nurse
that
vengeance
whets
the
tooth
and
oh
the
golden
time
of
jamie
s
youth
that
it
should
darken
for
a
graybeard
s
whim
so
hugh
had
brooded
till
there
came
on
him
the
pity
of
a
slow
rain
after
drouth
but
at
the
crossing
of
the
rosebud
s
mouth
a
shadow
fell
upon
his
growing
dream
a
band
of
henry
s
traders
bound
down
stream
who
paused
to
traffic
in
the
latest
news
for
matters
seen
and
heard
in
higher
not
met
the
lad
not
yet
encountered
anyone
who
had
alas
the
journey
back
to
yesterwhiles
how
tangled
are
the
trails
the
stubborn
miles
how
wearily
they
stretch
and
if
one
win
the
long
way
back
in
search
of
what
has
been
shall
he
find
aught
that
is
not
strange
and
new
thus
wrought
the
melancholy
news
in
hugh
as
he
turned
back
with
those
who
brought
the
news
for
more
and
more
he
dreaded
now
to
lose
what
doubtful
seeking
rendered
doubly
dear
and
in
the
time
when
keen
winds
stripped
the
year
he
came
with
those
to
where
the
poplar
joins
the
greater
river
there
assinoboines
rich
from
the
summer
s
hunting
had
come
down
and
flung
along
the
flat
their
ragged
town
that
traders
might
bring
goods
and
winter
there
so
leave
the
heartsick
graybeard
otherwhere
the
final
curtain
rises
on
the
play
tis
dead
of
winter
now
for
day
on
day
the
blizzard
wind
has
thundered
sweeping
wide
from
mississippi
to
the
great
divide
out
of
the
north
beyond
saskatchewan
brief
evening
glimmers
like
an
inverse
dawn
after
a
long
white
night
the
tempest
dies
the
lifts
now
let
the
curtain
rise
upon
milk
river
valley
and
reveal
the
stars
like
broken
glass
on
frosted
steel
above
the
piegan
lodges
huddled
deep
in
snowdrifts
like
a
freezing
flock
of
sheep
a
crystal
weight
the
dread
cold
crushes
down
and
no
one
moves
about
the
little
town
that
seems
to
grovel
as
a
thing
that
fears
but
see
a
swings
a
squaw
appears
hunched
with
the
sudden
cold
her
footsteps
creak
shrill
in
the
hush
she
stares
upon
the
bleak
white
skyline
for
a
moment
then
goes
in
we
follow
her
push
back
the
flap
of
skin
enter
the
lodge
inhale
the
air
and
blink
upon
the
little
that
blossoms
in
the
center
of
the
room
unsteady
shadows
haunt
the
outer
gloom
wherein
the
walls
are
guessed
at
upward
far
the
now
and
then
reveals
a
star
as
in
a
well
the
ancient
squaw
her
face
stirs
a
pot
of
soup
that
simmers
with
a
pleasant
smell
and
sound
a
gnarled
old
man
upon
the
ground
sits
brooding
near
he
feeds
the
flame
with
sticks
it
brightens
lo
a
leaden
crucifix
upon
the
wall
these
heathen
eyes
though
dim
have
seen
the
white
man
s
god
and
cling
to
him
lest
on
the
sunset
trail
slow
feet
should
err
but
look
again
from
yonder
bed
of
fur
beside
the
wall
a
white
man
strives
to
rise
he
lifts
his
head
with
yearning
sightless
eyes
gropes
for
the
light
a
mass
of
golden
hair
falls
round
the
face
that
sickness
and
despair
somehow
make
old
albeit
he
is
young
his
weak
voice
stumbling
to
the
mongrel
tongue
of
traders
flings
a
question
to
the
squaw
you
saw
no
black
robe
tell
me
what
you
saw
and
she
as
her
race
replies
heaped
kiote
on
the
the
blind
youth
huddles
moaning
in
the
furs
the
firewood
spits
and
pops
the
boiled
pot
purrs
and
sputters
on
this
little
isle
of
sound
the
sea
of
winter
silence
presses
one
feels
it
like
a
menace
now
the
crone
dips
out
a
cup
of
soup
and
having
blown
upon
it
takes
it
to
the
sick
man
there
and
bids
him
eat
with
wild
unseeing
stare
he
turns
upon
her
why
are
they
so
long
i
can
not
eat
i
ve
done
a
mighty
wrong
it
chokes
me
oh
no
no
i
must
not
die
until
the
black
robe
comes
his
feeble
cry
sinks
to
a
whisper
tell
me
did
they
your
kinsmen
they
went
south
before
the
and
will
they
tell
the
black
robe
they
will
the
crackling
of
the
faggots
for
a
spell
seems
very
loud
again
the
sick
man
moans
and
struggling
with
the
weakness
in
his
bones
would
gain
his
feet
but
can
not
go
again
and
tell
me
that
you
see
the
bulks
of
men
dim
in
the
distance
the
squaw
obeys
returns
anon
to
crouch
beside
the
blaze
and
from
the
night
the
vacant
eyes
that
hunger
for
the
light
are
turned
upon
her
tell
me
what
you
saw
or
maybe
snowshoes
sounded
up
the
draw
quick
tell
me
what
you
saw
and
heard
out
there
heaped
stillness
one
clutching
at
thin
ice
with
numbing
grip
cries
while
he
hopes
but
when
his
fingers
slip
he
takes
the
final
plunge
without
a
sound
so
sinks
the
youth
now
hopeless
all
around
the
winter
silence
presses
in
the
walls
grow
vague
and
vanish
in
the
gloom
that
crawls
close
to
the
failing
fire
the
piegans
sleep
night
hovers
midway
down
the
morning
steep
the
sick
man
drowses
nervously
he
starts
and
listens
hears
no
sound
except
his
heart
s
and
that
weird
murmur
brooding
stillness
makes
but
stealthily
upon
the
quiet
vague
as
the
coursing
of
the
hearer
s
a
muffled
rhythmic
beating
thud
on
thud
that
growing
nearer
deepens
to
a
crunch
so
hungry
for
the
distance
snowshoes
munch
the
crusted
leagues
of
winter
stride
by
stride
a
barks
the
hollow
world
outside
brims
with
the
running
howl
of
many
curs
now
half
risen
in
the
furs
the
youth
can
hear
low
voices
and
the
creak
of
snowshoes
near
the
lodge
his
thin
wild
shriek
startles
the
old
folk
from
their
slumberings
he
comes
the
black
robe
now
the
swings
and
briefly
one
who
splutters
piegan
bars
the
way
then
enters
now
the
patch
of
stars
is
darkened
with
a
greater
bulk
that
bends
beneath
the
lintel
peace
be
with
you
friends
and
peace
with
him
herein
who
suffers
pain
so

lad
then
the
westward
march
with
major
henry
s
men
with
all
that
happened
there
upon
the
grand
and
so
we
hit
the
trail
of
henry
s
band
the
youth
continues
for
we
feared
to
die
and
dread
of
shame
was
ready
with
the
lie
we
carried
to
our
comrades
hugh
was
dead
and
buried
there
beside
the
grand
we
said
could
any
doubt
that
what
we
said
was
true
they
even
praised
our
courage
but
i
knew
the
nights
were
hell
because
i
heard
his
cries
and
saw
the
crows
at
his
eyes
the
kiotes
tearing
at
him
o
my
god
i
tried
and
tried
to
think
him
under
sod
but
every
time
i
slept
it
was
the
same
and
then
one
lay
came
i
say
he
know
i
hadn
t
slept
amid
a
light
like
rainy
dawn
he
crept
out
of
the
dark
upon
his
hands
and
knees
the
wound
he
got
that
day
among
the
rees
was
like
red
fire
a
snarl
of
bloody
hair
hung
round
the
eyes
that
had
a
pleading
stare
and
down
the
ruined
face
and
gory
beard
big
rolled
he
went
as
he
appeared
trailing
a
fog
of
light
that
died
away
and
i
grew
old
before
i
saw
the
day
o
father
i
had
paid
too
much
for
breath
the
devil
traffics
in
the
fear
of
death
and
may
god
pity
anyone
who
buys
what
i
have
bought
with
treachery
and
this
gnawing
in
my
breast
i
knew
i
couldn
t
rest
until
i
buried
hugh
and
so
i
told
the
major
i
would
go
to
atkinson
with
letters
ere
the
snow
had
choked
the
trails
jules
wouldn
t
come
along
he
didn
t
seem
to
realize
the
wrong
he
called
me
foolish
couldn
t
understand
i
rode
south
but
to
the
grand
daylong
my
horse
beat
thunder
from
the
sod
accusing
me
and
all
my
prayers
to
god
seemed
flung
in
vain
at
bolted
gates
of
brass
and
in
the
night
the
wind
among
the
grass
hissed
endlessly
the
story
of
my
shame
i
do
not
know
how
long
i
rode
i
came
upon
the
grand
at
last
and
found
the
place
and
it
was
empty
not
a
sign
or
trace
was
left
to
show
what
end
had
come
to
hugh
and
oh
that
grave
it
gaped
upon
the
blue
a
pleading
dumbly
for
the
slain
i
filled
it
up
and
fled
across
the
plain
and
somehow
came
to
atkinson
at
last
and
there
i
heard
the
living
hugh
had
passed
along
the
river
northward
in
the
fall
o
father
he
had
found
the
strength
to
crawl
that
long
distance
back
to
life
though
jules
had
taken
blanket
steel
and
knife
and
i
his
trusted
comrade
had
his
gun
they
said
i
d
better
stay
at
atkinson
because
old
hugh
was
surely
hunting
me
to
kill
i
did
not
want
to
flee
or
hide
from
him
i
even
wished
to
die
if
so
this
aching
cancer
of
a
lie
might
be
torn
out
forever
so
i
went
as
eager
as
the
homesick
homeward
bent
in
search
of
him
and
peace
but
i
was
cursed
for
even
when
his
stolen
rifle
burst
and
spewed
upon
me
this
eternal
night
i
might
not
die
as
any
other
might
but
god
so
willed
that
friendly
piegans
came
to
spare
me
yet
a
little
unto
shame
o
father
is
there
any
hope
for
me
great
hope
