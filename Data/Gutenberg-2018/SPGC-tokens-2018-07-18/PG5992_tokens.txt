station
amusements
in
new
zealand
by
lady
barker
preface
the
interest
shown
by
the
public
in
the
simple
and
true
account
of
life
in
new
zealand
published
by
the
author
three
years
ago
has
encouraged
her
to
enlarge
upon
the
theme
this
volume
is
but
a
continuation
of
station
life
with
this
difference
that
whereas
that
little
book
dwelt
somewhat
upon
practical
matters
these
pages
are
entirely
devoted
to
reminiscences
of
the
idler
hours
of
a
life
many
readers
have
friends
and
relations
out
in
those
beautiful
distant
islands
and
though
her
book
should
possess
no
wider
interest
the
author
hopes
that
these
at
least
will
care
to
know
exactly
what
sort
of
life
their
absent
dear
ones
are
leading
one
thing
is
certain
that
few
books
can
ever
have
afforded
so
much
pleasure
to
their
authors
or
can
have
appeared
more
completely
to
write
themselves
than
station
life
and
this
its
sequel
a
b
chapter
i
a
bush
picnic
since
my
return
to
england
two
years
ago
i
have
been
frequently
asked
by
my
friends
and
acquaintances
how
did
you
amuse
yourself
up
at
the
station
i
am
generally
tempted
to
reply
we
were
all
too
busy
to
need
amusement
but
when
i
come
to
think
the
matter
over
calmly
and
dispassionately
i
find
that
a
great
many
of
our
occupations
may
be
classed
under
the
head
of
play
rather
than
work
but
that
would
hardly
give
a
fair
idea
of
our
lives
there
either
it
would
be
more
correct
to
say
perhaps
that
most
of
our
simple
pleasures
were
composed
of
a
solid
layer
of
usefulness
underneath
the
froth
of
fun
and
frolic
i
purpose
therefore
in
these
sketches
to
describe
some
of
the
pursuits
which
afforded
us
a
keen
enjoyment
at
the
time
an
enjoyment
arising
from
perfect
health
simple
tastes
and
an
exquisite
climate
it
will
be
as
well
to
begin
with
the
description
of
one
of
the
picnics
which
were
favourite
amusements
in
our
home
nestled
in
a
valley
of
the
malvern
hills
of
canterbury
these
hills
are
of
a
very
respectable
height
and
constitute
in
fact
the
lowest
slopes
of
the
great
southern
alps
which
rise
to
peaks
behind
them
our
little
wooden
homestead
stood
at
the
head
of
a
sunny
sheltered
valley
and
around
it
we
could
see
the
hills
gradually
rolling
into
downs
which
in
their
turn
were
smoothed
out
some
ten
or
twelve
miles
off
into
the
dead
level
of
the
plains
the
only
drawback
to
the
picturesque
beauty
of
these
lower
ranges
is
the
absence
of
forest
or
as
it
is
called
there
bush
behind
the
malvern
hills
where
they
begin
to
rise
into
steeper
ascents
lies
many
and
many
a
mile
of
mountain
making
deep
blue
shadows
when
the
setting
sun
brings
the
grand
alpine
range
into
sharp
white
outline
against
the
background
of
dazzling
italian
sky
but
just
here
where
my
beloved
antipodean
home
stood
we
had
no
trees
whatever
except
those
which
we
had
planted
ourselves
and
whose
growth
we
watched
with
eager
interest
i
dwell
a
little
upon
this
point
to
try
to
convey
to
any
one
who
may
glance
at
these
pages
how
we
all
dwellers
among
hills
as
we
were
longed
and
pined
for
the
sights
and
sounds
of
a
bush
quite
out
of
view
from
the
house
or
garden
and
about
seven
miles
away
lay
a
mountain
pass
or
saddle
over
a
range
which
was
densely
wooded
and
from
whose
highest
peak
we
could
see
a
wide
extent
of
timbered
country
often
in
our
evening
rides
we
have
gone
round
by
that
saddle
in
spite
of
a
track
and
quicksands
and
bogs
just
to
satisfy
our
constant
longing
for
green
leaves
waving
branches
and
the
twitter
of
birds
whenever
any
wood
was
wanted
for
building
a
stockyard
or
slabbing
a
well
or
making
a
fence
around
a
new
paddock
we
were
obliged
to
take
out
a
government
license
to
cut
wood
in
this
splendid
bush
armed
with
the
necessary
document
the
next
step
was
to
engage
bushmen
or
woodcutters
by
profession
who
felled
and
cut
the
timber
into
the
proper
lengths
and
stacked
it
neatly
in
a
clearing
where
it
could
get
dry
and
seasoned
these
stacks
were
often
placed
in
such
inaccessible
and
rocky
parts
of
the
steep
mountain
side
that
they
had
to
be
brought
down
to
the
flat
in
rude
little
sledges
drawn
by
a
bullock
who
required
to
be
trained
to
the
work
and
to
possess
so
steady
and
equable
a
disposition
as
to
be
indifferent
to
the
annoyance
of
great
logs
of
heavy
wood
dangling
and
bumping
against
his
heels
as
the
sledge
pursued
its
uneven
way
down
the
bed
of
a
mountain
torrent
in
default
of
a
better
road
imagine
then
a
beautiful
day
in
our
early
new
zealand
autumn
for
a
week
past
a
furious
gale
had
been
blowing
down
the
gorges
of
the
rakaia
and
the
selwyn
as
if
it
had
come
out
of
a
funnel
and
sweeping
across
the
great
shelterless
plains
with
irresistible
force
we
had
been
close
prisoners
to
the
house
all
those
days
dreading
to
open
a
door
to
go
out
for
wood
or
water
lest
a
terrific
blast
should
rush
in
and
whip
the
light
shingle
roof
off
not
an
animal
could
be
seen
out
of
doors
they
had
all
taken
shelter
on
the
of
the
gorse
hedges
which
are
always
planted
round
a
garden
to
give
the
vegetables
a
chance
of
coming
up
on
the
of
the
hills
could
be
perceived
towards
evening
mobs
of
sheep
feeding
with
their
heads
and
travelling
to
the
high
which
they
always
select
in
preference
to
a
valley
the
yellow
tussocks
were
bending
all
one
way
perfectly
flat
to
the
ground
and
the
shingle
on
the
gravel
walk
outside
rattled
like
hail
against
the
low
latticed
windows
the
uproar
from
the
gale
was
indescribable
and
the
little
fragile
house
swayed
and
shook
as
the
furious
gusts
hurled
themselves
against
it
inside
its
shelter
the
pictures
were
blowing
out
from
the
walls
until
i
expected
them
to
be
shaken
off
their
hooks
even
in
those
rooms
which
had
plank
walls
lined
with
papered
canvas
whilst
in
the
kitchen
whose
sides
were
made
of
cob
the
dust
blew
in
fine
clouds
from
the
pulverized
walls
penetrating
even
to
the
dairy
and
settling
half
an
inch
thick
on
my
precious
cream
at
last
when
our
skin
felt
like
tightly
drawn
parchment
and
our
ears
and
eyes
had
long
been
filled
with
powdered
earth
the
wind
dropped
at
sunset
as
suddenly
as
it
had
risen
five
days
before
we
ventured
out
to
breathe
the
atmosphere
and
to
look
if
the
swollen
creeks
swollen
because
had
done
or
threatened
to
do
any
mischief
and
saw
on
the
horizon
great
fleecy
masses
of
cloud
driving
rapidly
up
before
a
chill
icy
breeze
hurrah
here
comes
a
the
earth
the
shrivelled
leaves
the
dusty
grass
all
needed
the
blessed
damp
air
in
an
hour
it
was
upon
us
we
had
barely
time
to
house
the
cows
and
horses
to
feed
the
fowls
and
secure
them
in
their
own
shed
and
to
light
a
roaring
coal
or
rather
lignite
for
it
is
not
true
coal
fire
in
the
when
with
a
few
warning
splashes
the
deluge
of
cold
rain
came
steadily
down
and
we
went
to
sleep
to
the
welcome
sound
of
its
refreshing
patter
all
that
i
have
been
describing
was
the
weather
of
the
past
week
disagreeable
as
it
might
have
been
it
was
needed
in
both
its
hot
and
cold
dry
and
wet
extremes
to
make
a
true
new
zealand
day
the
furious
had
blown
every
fleck
of
cloud
below
the
horizon
and
dried
the
air
until
it
was
as
light
as
ether
the
buster
on
the
other
hand
had
cooled
and
refreshed
everything
in
the
most
delicious
way
and
a
perfect
day
had
come
at
last
what
words
can
describe
the
pleasure
it
is
to
inhale
such
an
atmosphere
one
feels
as
if
old
age
or
sickness
or
even
sorrow
could
hardly
exist
beneath
such
a
spotless
vault
of
blue
as
stretched
out
above
our
happy
heads
i
have
often
been
told
that
this
feeling
of
intense
pleasure
on
a
fine
day
which
is
peculiar
to
new
zealand
is
really
a
very
low
form
of
animal
enjoyment
it
may
be
so
but
i
only
know
that
i
never
stood
in
the
verandah
early
in
the
morning
of
such
a
day
as
i
am
trying
to
sketch
in
pen
and
ink
now
without
feeling
the
highest
spiritual
joy
the
deepest
thankfulness
to
the
loving
father
who
had
made
his
beautiful
world
so
fair
and
who
would
fain
lead
us
through
its
paths
of
pleasantness
to
a
still
more
glorious
home
which
will
be
free
from
the
shadows
brooding
from
beneath
sin
wings
over
this
one
as
i
stood
in
the
porch
i
have
often
fancied
i
could
seethe
animals
and
even
the
poultry
expressing
in
dumb
brute
fashion
their
joy
and
gratitude
to
the
god
from
whom
all
blessings
flow
but
to
return
to
the
verandah
although
we
have
never
left
it
presently
f
came
out
and
i
said
with
a
sigh
born
of
deep
content
and
happiness
what
a
day
yes
answered
f
a
heavenly
day
indeed
well
worth
waiting
for
i
want
to
go
and
see
how
the
men
are
getting
on
in
the
bush
will
you
like
to
come
too
of
course
i
will
what
can
be
more
enchanting
than
the
prospect
of
spending
such
sunny
hours
in
that
glorious
bush
so
after
breakfast
i
give
my
few
simple
orders
to
the
cook
and
prepare
to
pack
a
maori
kit
or
flat
basket
made
of
flax
which
could
be
fastened
to
my
with
the
preparations
for
our
luncheon
first
some
mutton
chops
had
to
be
trimmed
and
prepared
all
ready
to
be
cooked
when
we
got
there
these
were
neatly
folded
up
in
clean
paper
and
a
little
packet
of
tea
a
few
lumps
of
white
sugar
a
tiny
wooden
contrivance
for
holding
salt
and
pepper
and
a
couple
of
knives
and
forks
were
added
to
the
parcel
so
much
for
the
contents
of
the
basket
they
needed
to
be
carefully
packed
so
as
not
to
rattle
in
any
way
or
helen
my
pretty
bay
mare
would
soon
have
got
rid
of
the
luncheon
and
me
i
wrapped
up
three
or
four
large
raw
potatoes
in
separate
bits
of
paper
and
slipped
them
into
f
pockets
when
he
was
looking
another
way
and
then
began
the
real
difficulty
of
my
picnic
how
was
the
little
tin
and
an
odd
delf
cup
to
be
carried
f
objected
to
put
them
also
in
his
pocket
assuring
me
that
i
could
make
very
good
tea
by
putting
my
packet
of
the
fragrant
leaves
into
the
bushmen
kettle
and
drinking
it
afterwards
out
of
one
of
their
pannikins
he
tried
to
bribe
me
to
this
latter
piece
of
simplicity
by
promising
to
wash
the
tin
pannikin
out
for
me
first
now
i
was
not
dainty
or
over
particular
i
could
not
have
enjoyed
my
new
zealand
life
so
thoroughly
if
i
had
been
either
but
i
did
not
like
the
idea
of
using
the
bushmen
tea
equipage
in
the
first
place
the
tea
never
tastes
the
same
when
made
in
their
way
and
allowed
to
boil
for
a
moment
or
two
after
the
leaves
have
been
thrown
in
before
the
kettle
is
taken
off
the
fire
and
in
the
next
place
it
is
very
difficult
to
drink
tea
out
of
a
pannikin
for
it
becomes
so
hot
directly
we
put
the
scalding
liquid
into
it
that
long
after
the
tea
is
cool
enough
to
drink
the
pannikin
still
continues
too
hot
to
touch
but
i
said
so
pathetically
you
know
how
wretched
i
am
without
my
tea
that
f
heart
relented
and
he
managed
to
stow
away
the
little
teapot
and
the
cup
that
cup
bore
a
charmed
life
it
accompanied
me
on
all
my
excursions
escaping
unbroken
and
is
i
believe
in
existence
now
spending
its
honoured
old
age
in
the
recesses
of
a
cupboard
after
the
luncheon
the
next
question
to
be
decided
is
which
of
the
dogs
are
to
join
the
expedition
hector
of
course
he
is
the
colley
and
would
no
more
look
at
a
sheep
except
in
the
way
of
business
than
he
would
fly
rose
a
little
terrier
was
the
most
fascinating
of
dog
companions
and
i
pleaded
hard
for
her
as
she
was
an
especial
pet
though
there
were
too
many
lambs
belonging
to
a
summer
lambing
in
new
zealand
the
winter
is
the
usual
lambing
season
in
the
sheltered
paddocks
beneath
the
bush
to
make
it
quite
safe
for
her
to
be
one
of
the
party
she
would
not
kill
or
hurt
a
lamb
on
any
account
but
she
always
appeared
anxious
to
play
with
the
little
creatures
and
as
her
own
spotless
coat
was
as
white
as
theirs
she
often
managed
to
get
quite
close
to
a
flock
of
sheep
before
they
perceived
that
she
belonged
to
the
dreaded
race
of
dogs
when
the
timid
animals
found
out
their
mistake
a
regular
stampede
used
to
ensue
and
it
was
not
supposed
to
be
good
for
the
health
of
the
old
or
young
sheep
to
hurry
up
the
in
such
wild
fashion
as
that
in
which
they
rushed
away
from
rose
attempts
to
intrude
on
their
society
nettle
may
come
for
he
is
but
a
tiny
terrier
and
so
fond
of
his
mistress
that
he
never
strays
a
yard
away
from
her
horse
heels
brisk
my
beautiful
stupid
is
also
allowed
an
outing
he
is
perfect
to
look
at
but
not
having
had
any
educational
advantages
in
his
youth
is
an
utter
fool
amiable
indeed
but
not
the
less
a
fool
garibaldi
another
colley
is
suffering
a
long
penal
sentence
of
being
tied
up
to
his
barrel
on
account
of
divers
unlawful
chases
after
sheep
which
were
not
wanted
and
dear
old
jip
though
she
pretends
to
be
very
anxious
to
accompany
us
is
far
too
fat
and
too
rheumatic
to
keep
pace
with
our
long
stretching
gallop
up
the
valley
at
last
we
were
fairly
off
about
eleven
and
an
hour
easy
canter
intersected
by
many
or
rather
across
the
numerous
creeks
brought
unto
the
foot
of
the
mountain
after
that
our
pace
became
a
very
sober
one
as
the
track
resembled
a
broken
rocky
staircase
more
than
a
but
such
as
it
was
our
horses
carried
us
safely
up
and
down
its
rugged
steeps
without
making
a
single
false
step
no
mule
can
be
more
than
a
new
zealand
horse
he
will
carry
his
rider
anywhere
if
only
that
rider
trusts
entirely
to
him
nor
attempts
to
guide
him
in
any
way
during
the
last
of
our
slow
and
climb
we
could
hear
the
ring
of
the
bushmen
axes
and
the
warning
shouts
preceding
the
crashing
fall
of
a
black
birch
fallen
logs
and
deep
ruts
made
by
the
sledges
in
their
descent
added
to
the
difficulties
of
the
track
and
i
was
so
as
to
entreat
piteously
on
more
than
one
occasion
when
helen
paused
and
shook
her
head
preparatory
to
climbing
over
a
barricade
to
be
taken
off
but
f
had
been
used
to
these
dreadful
roads
for
too
many
years
to
regard
them
in
the
same
light
as
i
did
and
would
answer
carelessly
nonsense
you
as
safe
as
if
you
were
sitting
in
an
all
i
can
say
is
it
might
have
been
so
but
i
did
not
feel
at
all
like
it
however
the
event
proved
him
to
have
been
right
and
we
reached
the
clearing
in
safety
here
we
dismounted
and
led
the
horses
to
a
place
where
they
could
nibble
some
grass
and
rest
in
the
cool
shade
the
saddles
and
bridles
were
soon
removed
and
halters
improvised
out
of
the
new
zealand
flax
which
can
be
turned
to
so
many
uses
having
provided
for
the
comfort
of
our
faithful
animals
our
next
step
was
to
look
for
the
bushmen
the
spot
which
we
had
reached
was
their
temporary
home
in
the
heart
of
the
forest
but
their
work
was
being
carried
on
elsewhere
i
could
not
have
told
from
which
side
the
regular
ringing
proceeded
so
confusing
were
the
echoes
from
the
cliffs
around
us
but
after
a
moment
silent
pause
f
said
if
we
follow
that
track
pointing
to
a
slightly
cleared
passage
among
the
trees
we
shall
come
upon
them
so
i
kilted
up
my
linsey
skirt
and
hung
up
my
little
jacket
necessary
for
protection
against
the
evening
air
on
a
bough
out
of
the
wekas
reach
whilst
i
followed
f
through
tangled
creepers
over
brake
over
brier
towards
the
place
from
whence
the
noise
of
falling
trees
proceeded
by
the
time
we
reached
it
our
scratched
hands
and
faces
bore
traces
of
the
thorny
undergrowth
which
had
barred
our
way
but
all
minor
discomforts
were
forgotten
in
the
picturesque
beauty
of
the
spot
around
us
lay
the
majestic
still
in
their
overthrow
whilst
substantial
stacks
of
and
split
timber
witnessed
to
the
skill
and
industry
of
the
stalwart
figures
before
us
who
reddened
through
their
sunburn
with
surprise
and
shyness
at
seeing
a
lady
they
need
not
have
been
afraid
of
me
for
i
had
long
ago
made
friends
with
them
and
during
the
preceeding
winter
had
established
a
sort
of
in
my
for
all
the
hands
employed
on
the
station
and
these
two
men
had
been
amongst
my
most
constant
pupils
one
of
them
a
big
was
very
backward
in
his
larning
and
though
he
plodded
on
diligently
never
got
beyond
the
simplest
words
in
the
largest
type
small
print
puzzled
him
at
once
and
he
had
a
habit
of
standing
or
sitting
with
his
back
to
me
whilst
repeating
his
lessons
nothing
would
induce
him
to
face
me
the
moment
it
became
his
turn
to
go
on
with
the
chapter
out
of
the
bible
with
which
we
commenced
our
studies
that
instant
he
turned
his
broad
shoulders
towards
me
and
i
could
only
hear
the
faintest
murmurs
issuing
from
the
depths
of
a
great
beard
remonstrance
would
have
scared
my
shy
pupil
away
so
i
was
fain
to
put
up
with
his
own
method
of
instruction
but
this
is
a
digression
and
i
want
to
make
you
see
with
my
eyes
the
beautiful
glimpses
of
distant
country
lying
around
the
bold
wooded
cliff
on
which
we
were
standing
the
ground
fell
away
from
our
feet
so
completely
in
some
places
that
we
could
see
over
the
tops
of
the
high
trees
around
us
whilst
in
others
the
landscape
appeared
framed
in
an
arch
of
quivering
foliage
a
noisy
little
creek
chattered
and
babbled
as
it
hurried
along
to
join
its
big
brother
down
below
and
kept
a
fringe
of
exquisite
ferns
which
grew
along
its
banks
brightly
green
by
its
moisture
each
tree
if
taken
by
itself
was
more
like
an
umbrella
than
anything
else
to
english
eyes
for
in
these
primitive
forests
where
no
kind
pruning
hand
has
ever
touched
them
they
shoot
up
straight
and
branchless
into
the
free
air
above
where
they
spread
a
leafy
crown
out
to
the
sunbeams
beneath
the
dense
shade
of
these
matted
branches
grew
a
luxuriant
shrubbery
whose
every
leaf
was
a
marvel
of
delicate
beauty
and
ferns
found
here
a
home
such
as
they
might
seek
elsewhere
in
vain
flowers
were
very
rare
and
i
did
not
observe
many
berries
but
these
conditions
vary
in
different
parts
of
the
beautiful
middle
island
that
was
a
fair
and
fertile
land
stretching
out
before
us
intersected
by
the
deep
banks
of
the
rakaia
with
here
and
there
a
tiny
patch
of
emerald
green
and
a
white
dot
representing
the
house
and
english
grass
paddock
of
a
new
settler
in
the
background
the
mountains
rose
ever
higher
and
higher
in
bolder
outline
till
they
shook
off
their
leafy
clothing
and
stood
out
in
steep
cliffs
and
scaurs
from
the
glacier
region
of
the
mountain
range
running
from
north
to
south
and
forming
the
back
bone
of
the
island
i
may
perhaps
make
you
see
the
yellow
plains
and
the
great
confusion
of
rising
ground
behind
them
but
can
not
make
you
see
still
less
feel
the
atmosphere
around
quivering
in
a
summer
haze
in
the
valley
beneath
and
stirred
to
the
faintest
summer
as
it
moved
among
the
pines
and
birches
overhead
its
lightness
was
its
most
striking
peculiarity
you
felt
as
if
your
lungs
could
never
weary
of
inhaling
deep
breaths
of
such
an
air
warm
without
oppression
cool
without
a
chill
i
can
find
nothing
but
paradoxes
to
describe
it
as
for
fatigue
one
muscles
might
get
tired
and
need
rest
but
the
usual
depression
and
weariness
attending
could
not
exist
in
such
an
atmosphere
one
felt
like
a
happy
child
pleased
at
nothing
content
to
exist
where
existence
was
a
pleasure
you
could
not
find
more
favourable
specimens
of
new
zealand
colonists
than
the
two
men
trew
and
domville
who
stood
before
us
in
their
working
dress
of
red
flannel
shirts
and
moleskin
trousers
cookham
boots
and
digger
plush
hats
three
years
before
this
day
they
had
landed
at
port
lyttleton
with
no
other
capital
than
their
strong
willing
arms
and
their
sober
sensible
heads
very
different
is
their
appearance
from
what
it
was
on
their
arrival
and
the
change
in
their
position
and
circumstances
is
as
great
their
bodily
frames
have
filled
out
and
developed
under
the
influence
of
the
healthy
climate
and
abundance
of
mutton
until
they
look
ten
years
younger
and
twice
as
strong
and
each
man
owns
a
cottage
and
twenty
acres
of
freehold
land
at
which
he
works
in
spare
time
as
well
as
having
more
pounds
than
he
ever
possessed
pence
in
the
old
country
put
safely
away
in
the
bank
there
can
be
no
doubt
about
the
future
of
any
working
man
or
woman
in
our
new
zealand
colonies
it
rests
in
their
own
hands
under
blessing
and
the
history
of
the
whole
human
race
shows
us
that
he
always
has
blessed
honest
labour
and
rightly
directed
efforts
to
do
our
duty
in
this
world
sobriety
and
industry
are
the
first
essentials
to
success
possessing
these
moral
qualifications
and
a
pair
of
hands
a
man
may
rear
up
his
children
in
those
beautiful
distant
lands
in
ignorance
of
what
hunger
or
thirst
or
grinding
poverty
means
hitherto
the
want
of
places
of
worship
and
schools
for
the
children
have
been
a
sad
drawback
to
the
material
advantages
of
colonization
at
the
antipodes
but
these
blessings
are
increasing
every
day
and
the
need
of
them
creates
the
supply
the
great
mistake
made
in
england
next
to
that
of
sending
out
worthless
idle
paupers
who
have
never
done
a
hand
turn
for
themselves
here
and
are
still
less
likely
to
do
it
elsewhere
is
for
parents
and
guardians
to
ship
off
to
new
zealand
young
men
who
have
received
the
and
education
of
gentlemen
without
a
shilling
in
their
pockets
under
the
vague
idea
that
something
will
turn
up
for
them
in
a
new
place
there
is
nothing
which
can
turn
up
for
the
machinery
of
civilization
is
reduced
to
the
most
primitive
scale
in
these
countries
and
i
have
known
pounds
per
annum
regarded
as
a
monstrous
salary
to
be
drawn
by
a
official
of
some
twenty
years
standing
and
great
experience
in
the
colony
from
this
we
may
judge
of
the
chances
of
remunerative
employment
for
a
raw
unfledged
youth
with
a
smattering
of
classical
learning
at
first
they
simply
loaf
as
it
is
called
there
on
their
acquaintances
and
friends
at
the
end
of
six
months
their
clothes
are
beginning
to
look
shabby
they
feel
they
to
do
something
and
they
make
day
by
day
the
terrible
discovery
that
there
is
nothing
for
them
to
do
in
their
own
rank
of
life
many
a
poor
clergyman
son
sooner
than
return
to
the
home
which
has
been
so
pinched
to
furnish
forth
his
passage
money
and
outfit
takes
a
shepherd
billet
though
he
generally
makes
a
very
bad
shepherd
for
the
first
year
or
two
or
drives
bullocks
or
perhaps
wanders
vaguely
over
the
country
looking
for
work
and
getting
food
and
lodging
indeed
for
inhospitality
is
unknown
but
no
pay
sometimes
they
go
to
the
diggings
only
to
find
that
money
is
as
necessary
there
as
anywhere
and
that
they
are
not
fitted
to
dig
in
wet
holes
for
eight
or
ten
hours
a
day
often
these
poor
young
men
go
home
again
and
it
is
the
best
thing
they
can
do
for
at
least
they
have
gained
some
knowledge
of
life
on
its
dark
as
well
as
its
brighter
side
but
still
oftener
alas
they
go
hopelessly
to
the
bad
degenerating
into
billiard
markers
piano
players
at
dancing
saloons
cattle
drivers
and
their
friends
probably
lose
sight
of
them
once
i
was
riding
with
my
husband
up
a
lovely
gulley
when
we
heard
the
crack
of
a
stockwhip
sounding
strangely
through
the
deep
eternal
silence
of
a
new
zealand
valley
and
a
turn
of
the
track
showed
us
a
heavy
labouring
slowly
along
at
the
head
of
the
long
team
sauntered
the
driver
in
the
usual
costume
with
his
soft
plush
hat
pulled
low
over
his
face
and
pulling
vigorously
at
a
clay
pipe
in
spite
of
all
the
outer
surroundings
something
in
the
man
walk
and
dejected
attitude
struck
my
imagination
and
i
made
some
remark
to
my
companion
the
sound
of
my
voice
reached
the
ears
he
looked
up
and
on
seeing
a
lady
took
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
his
hat
off
his
head
and
forcing
his
beasts
a
little
aside
stood
at
their
head
to
let
us
pass
i
smiled
and
nodded
receiving
in
return
a
perfect
and
profound
bow
and
the
most
melancholy
glance
i
have
ever
seen
in
human
eyes
good
gracious
f
i
cried
when
we
had
passed
who
is
that
man
that
is
sir
third
son
he
replied
they
sent
him
out
here
without
a
shilling
five
years
ago
and
that
is
what
he
has
come
to
a
working
man
living
with
working
men
he
looks
poor
fellow
does
he
i
acting
upon
impulse
as
any
woman
would
have
done
turning
back
and
rode
up
to
him
finding
it
very
difficult
to
frame
my
pity
and
sympathy
in
coherent
words
no
thank
you
was
all
the
answer
i
could
get
in
the
most
refined
gentlemanly
tone
of
voice
i
very
well
as
i
am
i
should
only
have
the
struggle
all
over
again
if
i
made
any
change
now
it
is
the
truest
kindness
to
leave
me
alone
he
would
not
even
shake
hands
with
me
so
i
rode
back
discomfited
to
hear
from
f
that
he
had
made
many
attempts
to
befriend
him
but
without
success
in
fact
concluded
f
with
some
embarrassment
he
drinks
dreadfully
poor
fellow
of
course
that
is
the
secret
of
all
his
wretchedness
but
i
believe
despair
drove
him
to
it
in
the
first
instance
i
have
also
known
an
officer
working
as
a
clerk
in
an
attorney
office
at
fifteen
shillings
a
week
who
lived
like
a
mechanic
and
yet
spake
and
stepped
like
his
old
self
one
listened
involuntarily
for
the
clink
of
the
sabre
and
spur
whenever
he
moved
across
the
room
this
has
been
a
terrible
digression
almost
a
social
essay
in
fact
but
i
have
it
so
much
at
heart
to
dissuade
fathers
and
mothers
from
sending
their
sons
so
far
away
without
any
certainty
of
employment
capitalists
even
small
ones
do
well
in
new
zealand
the
labouring
classes
still
better
but
there
is
no
place
yet
for
the
educated
gentleman
without
money
and
with
hands
unused
to
and
unfit
for
manual
labour
and
the
downward
path
is
just
as
smooth
and
pleasant
at
first
there
as
anywhere
else
trew
and
domville
soon
got
over
their
momentary
shyness
and
answered
my
inquiries
about
their
families
then
i
had
a
short
talk
with
them
but
on
the
principle
that
it
is
ill
speaking
to
a
fasting
man
we
agreed
to
adjourn
to
the
clearing
where
they
had
built
a
rough
log
hut
for
temporary
shelter
and
have
our
dinner
they
had
provided
themselves
with
some
bacon
but
were
very
glad
to
accept
of
f
offer
of
mutton
to
be
had
for
the
trouble
of
fetching
it
when
we
reached
the
little
shanty
trew
produced
some
capital
bread
he
had
baked
the
evening
before
in
a
f
pockets
were
emptied
of
their
load
of
potatoes
which
were
put
to
roast
in
the
wood
embers
rashers
of
bacon
and
mutton
chops
spluttered
and
fizzed
on
a
monster
gridiron
with
tall
feet
so
as
to
allow
it
to
stand
by
itself
over
the
clear
fire
and
we
turned
our
chops
from
time
to
time
by
means
of
a
fork
extemporized
out
of
a
pronged
stick
over
another
fire
a
little
way
to
leeward
hung
the
bushmen
kettle
on
an
iron
tripod
and
so
soon
as
it
boiled
my
little
teapot
was
filled
before
domville
threw
in
his
great
of
tea
i
had
brought
a
tiny
phial
of
cream
in
the
pocket
of
my
saddle
but
the
men
thought
it
spoiled
the
flavour
of
the
tea
which
they
always
drink
as
they
call
it
the
temperance
society
could
draw
many
interesting
statistics
from
the
amount
of
hard
work
which
is
done
in
new
zealand
on
tea
now
i
am
sorry
to
say
beer
is
creeping
up
to
the
stations
and
is
served
out
at
shearing
time
and
so
on
but
in
the
old
days
all
the
hard
work
used
to
be
done
on
tea
and
tea
alone
the
men
always
declaring
they
worked
far
better
on
it
than
on
beer
when
we
have
as
much
good
bread
and
mutton
as
we
can
eat
they
would
say
we
do
feel
to
miss
the
beer
we
used
to
drink
in
england
and
at
the
end
of
a
year
or
two
of
tea
and
their
bright
eyes
and
splendid
physical
condition
showed
plainly
enough
which
was
the
best
kind
of
beverage
to
work
and
work
hard
too
upon
so
there
we
sat
round
the
fire
f
with
the
men
and
i
a
little
way
off
out
of
the
smoke
with
the
dogs
overhead
the
sunlight
streamed
down
on
the
grass
which
had
sprung
up
as
it
always
does
in
a
clearing
the
rustle
among
the
lofty
tree
tops
made
a
delicious
murmur
high
up
in
the
air
a
waft
of
cool
breeze
flitted
past
us
laden
with
the
scent
of
wood
and
who
does
not
know
that
nice
perfume
innumerable
paroquets
almost
brushed
us
with
their
wings
whilst
the
tamer
robin
or
the
dingy
but
melodious
came
near
to
watch
the
intruders
the
sweet
clear
whistle
of
the
tui
or
so
called
from
his
glossy
black
suit
and
white
wattles
curling
exactly
where
a
bands
would
be
could
be
heard
at
a
distance
whilst
overhead
the
soft
cooing
of
the
wild
pigeons
and
the
hoarse
croak
of
the
or
native
parrot
made
up
the
music
of
the
birds
orchestra
ah
how
delicious
it
all
was
the
robinson
crusoe
feel
of
the
whole
thing
the
heavenly
air
the
fluttering
leaves
the
birds
chirrups
and
whistle
and
the
foreground
of
happy
healthy
men
rose
and
i
had
enough
to
do
even
with
nettle
assistance
in
acting
as
police
to
keep
off
those
bold
thieves
the
wekas
who
are
as
impudent
as
they
are
tame
and
fearless
in
appearance
they
resemble
exactly
a
stout
hen
pheasant
without
its
long
tail
but
they
belong
to
the
apterix
family
and
have
no
wings
only
a
tiny
useless
pinion
at
each
shoulder
furnished
with
a
claw
like
a
small
what
is
the
use
of
this
claw
i
was
never
able
to
discover
when
startled
or
hunted
the
weka
glides
for
it
can
scarcely
be
called
running
with
incredible
swiftness
and
in
perfect
silence
to
the
nearest
cover
a
tussock
a
clump
of
flax
a
tuft
of
tall
tohi
grass
all
serve
as
and
wingless
as
she
is
the
weka
can
hold
her
own
very
well
against
her
enemies
the
dogs
i
really
believe
the
great
desire
of
brisk
life
was
to
catch
a
weka
he
started
many
but
used
to
go
sniffing
and
barking
round
the
flax
bush
where
it
had
taken
refuge
at
first
long
after
the
clever
cunning
bird
had
glided
from
its
shelter
to
another
cover
further
off
after
dinner
was
over
and
domville
had
brought
back
the
tin
plates
and
pannikins
from
the
creek
where
he
had
washed
them
up
pipes
were
lighted
and
a
few
minutes
smoking
served
to
rest
and
refresh
the
men
who
had
been
working
since
their
six
breakfast
the
daylight
hours
were
too
precious
however
to
be
wasted
in
smoking
trew
and
domville
would
not
have
had
that
comfortable
standing
in
their
name
at
the
bank
in
christchurch
if
they
had
spent
much
time
over
their
pipes
so
after
a
very
short
spell
they
got
up
from
the
fallen
log
of
wood
which
had
served
them
for
a
bench
and
suggested
that
f
should
accompany
them
back
to
where
their
work
lay
you
do
mind
being
left
asked
f
certainly
not
replied
i
i
have
got
the
dogs
for
company
and
a
book
in
my
pocket
i
daresay
i
shall
not
read
much
however
for
it
is
so
beautiful
to
sit
here
and
watch
the
changing
lights
and
shadows
and
so
it
was
most
beautiful
and
thoroughly
delightful
i
sat
on
the
short
sweet
grass
which
springs
upon
the
rich
loam
of
fallen
leaves
the
moment
sunlight
is
admitted
into
the
heart
of
a
bush
no
one
plants
it
probably
the
birds
carry
the
seeds
yet
it
grows
freely
after
a
clearing
has
been
made
nature
lays
down
a
green
sward
directly
on
the
rich
virgin
mould
and
sets
to
work
besides
to
cover
up
the
unsightly
stems
and
holes
of
the
fallen
timber
with
luxuriant
tufts
of
a
species
of
fern
which
grows
almost
as
freely
as
an
orchid
on
decayed
timber
i
was
so
still
and
silent
that
innumerable
forest
birds
came
about
me
a
wood
pigeon
alighted
on
a
branch
close
by
and
sat
preening
her
radiant
plumage
in
a
bath
of
golden
sunlight
the
profound
stillness
was
stirred
now
and
then
by
a
soft
sighing
breeze
which
passed
over
the
tree
tops
and
made
the
delicate
foliage
of
the
undergrowth
around
me
quiver
and
rustle
i
had
purposely
scattered
the
remains
of
our
meal
in
a
spot
where
the
birds
could
see
the
crumbs
and
it
was
not
long
before
the
clever
little
creatures
availed
themselves
of
the
unexpected
feast
so
perfectly
tame
and
friendly
were
they
that
i
felt
as
if
i
were
the
intruder
and
bound
by
all
the
laws
of
aerial
chivalry
to
keep
the
peace
but
this
was
no
easy
matter
where
rose
and
nettle
were
concerned
for
when
an
imprudent
weka
appeared
on
the
sylvan
scene
looking
if
to
say
who
afraid
it
was
more
than
i
could
do
to
keep
the
little
terriers
from
giving
chase
brisk
too
blundered
after
them
but
i
had
no
fear
of
his
destroying
the
charm
of
the
day
by
taking
even
a
weka
life
thus
the
delicious
afternoon
wore
on
until
it
was
time
to
boil
the
kettle
once
more
and
make
a
cup
of
tea
before
setting
out
homewards
the
lengthening
shadows
added
fresh
tenderness
and
beauty
to
the
peaceful
scene
and
the
sky
began
to
paint
itself
in
its
exquisite
sunset
hues
it
has
been
usual
to
praise
the
tints
of
tropic
skies
when
the
day
is
declining
but
never
in
any
of
my
wanderings
to
east
and
west
indies
have
i
seen
such
gorgeous
evening
colours
as
those
which
glorify
new
zealand
skies
a
loud
summoned
f
to
tea
and
directly
afterwards
the
horses
were
the
now
empty
flax
basket
filled
with
the
obnoxious
teapot
and
cup
wrapped
in
many
layers
of
flax
leaves
to
prevent
their
rattling
and
we
bade
good
night
to
the
tired
bushmen
we
left
them
at
their
tea
and
i
was
much
struck
to
observe
that
though
they
looked
like
men
who
had
done
a
hard
day
work
there
was
none
of
the
exhaustion
we
often
see
in
england
depicted
on
the
labouring
man
face
instead
of
a
hot
crowded
room
these
bushmen
were
going
to
sleep
in
their
log
hut
where
the
fresh
pure
air
could
circulate
through
every
nook
and
cranny
they
had
each
their
pair
of
red
blankets
one
to
spread
over
a
heap
of
freshly
cut
tussocks
which
formed
a
delicious
elastic
mattrass
and
the
other
to
serve
as
a
coverlet
during
the
day
these
blankets
were
always
hung
outside
on
a
tree
out
of
the
reach
of
the
most
investigating
weka
you
may
be
sure
i
had
not
come
in
the
way
of
books
and
papers
and
my
last
glance
as
i
rode
away
rested
on
trew
opening
a
number
of
note
was
not
in
existence
at
that
time
or
else
its
pages
are
just
what
those
simple
men
would
have
appreciated
and
enjoyed
and
the
used
to
be
their
favourite
periodicals
and
the
kindness
of
english
friends
kept
me
also
well
supplied
with
copies
of
miss
marsh
little
books
which
were
read
with
the
deepest
and
most
eager
interest
with
the
of
a
child
examining
a
packet
of
toys
and
so
we
rode
slowly
home
through
the
delicious
gloaming
with
the
evening
air
cooled
to
freshness
so
soon
as
the
sun
had
sunk
below
the
great
mountains
to
the
west
from
behind
which
he
shot
up
glorious
rays
of
gold
and
crimson
against
the
blue
ethereal
sky
causing
the
snowy
peaks
to
look
more
exquisitely
pure
from
the
background
of
gorgeous
colour
during
the
flood
of
sunlight
all
day
we
had
not
perceived
a
single
fleck
of
cloud
but
now
lovely
pink
wreaths
floating
in
betrayed
that
here
and
there
a
nursling
of
the
sky
lingered
behind
the
which
we
thought
had
all
been
blown
away
yesterday
the
short
twilight
hour
was
over
and
the
stars
were
filtering
their
soft
radiance
on
our
heads
by
the
time
we
heard
the
welcoming
barks
of
the
homestead
and
saw
the
glimmer
of
the
lighted
lamp
in
our
shining
out
of
the
distant
gloom
and
so
ended
in
supper
and
a
night
of
deep
dreamless
sleep
one
of
the
many
happy
picnic
days
of
my
new
zealand
life
chapter
ii
one
of
the
greatest
drawbacks
in
an
english
gentleman
eyes
to
living
in
new
zealand
is
the
want
of
sport
there
is
absolutely
none
there
used
to
be
a
few
quails
but
they
are
almost
extinct
now
and
during
four
years
residence
in
very
sequestered
regions
i
only
saw
one
wild
ducks
abound
on
some
of
the
rivers
but
they
are
becoming
fewer
and
shyer
every
year
the
beautiful
paradise
duck
is
gradually
retreating
to
those
inland
lakes
lying
at
the
foot
of
the
southern
alps
amid
glaciers
and
boulders
which
serve
as
a
barrier
to
keep
back
his
ruthless
foe
even
the
heron
once
so
plentiful
on
the
lowland
rivers
is
now
seldom
seen
as
i
write
these
lines
a
remorseful
recollection
comes
back
upon
me
of
overhanging
cliffs
and
of
a
bend
in
a
swirling
river
on
whose
rapid
current
a
beautiful
wounded
heron
its
right
wing
shattered
drifts
helplessly
round
and
round
with
the
eddying
water
each
circle
bringing
it
nearer
to
our
feet
i
can
see
now
its
bright
fearless
eye
full
of
suffering
but
yet
unconquered
its
slender
neck
proudly
arched
and
bearing
up
the
small
graceful
head
with
its
coronal
or
raised
in
defiance
as
if
to
protest
to
the
last
against
the
cruel
shot
which
had
just
been
fired
i
was
but
a
spectator
having
merely
wandered
that
far
to
look
at
my
yet
i
felt
as
guilty
as
though
my
hand
had
pulled
the
trigger
just
as
the
noble
bird
drifted
to
our
feet
for
i
could
not
help
going
down
to
the
edge
where
pepper
our
head
shepherd
stood
looking
very
contrite
it
reared
itself
half
out
of
the
water
with
a
hissing
noise
and
threatening
bill
resolved
to
sell
its
liberty
as
dearly
as
it
could
but
the
effort
only
spread
a
brighter
shade
of
crimson
on
the
waters
surface
for
a
brief
moment
and
then
with
glazing
eye
and
drooping
crest
the
dying
creature
turned
over
on
its
side
and
was
borne
helpless
to
our
feet
by
the
time
pepper
extended
his
arm
and
drew
it
in
with
the
quaint
apology
i
sorry
i
shot
yer
old
feller
i
am
indeed
the
heron
was
dead
and
that
happened
to
be
the
only
one
i
ever
came
across
during
my
mountain
life
once
i
saw
some
beautiful
flying
down
the
gorge
of
the
selwyn
and
f
nearly
broke
his
neck
in
climbing
the
crag
from
whence
one
of
them
rose
in
alarm
at
the
noise
of
our
horses
feet
on
the
shingle
there
were
three
eggs
in
the
inaccessible
and
he
brought
me
one
which
i
tried
in
vain
to
hatch
under
a
sitting
duck
betty
would
not
admit
the
intruder
among
her
own
eggs
but
resolutely
pushed
it
out
of
her
nest
twenty
times
a
day
until
at
last
i
was
obliged
to
blow
it
and
send
it
home
to
figure
in
a
little
boy
collection
far
away
in
kent
i
have
seen
very
good
blue
duck
shooting
on
the
waimakiriri
river
but
per
cent
of
the
birds
were
lost
for
want
of
a
retriever
bold
enough
to
face
that
formidable
river
wide
as
was
the
beautiful
reach
on
whose
shore
the
sportsmen
stood
and
calmly
as
the
deep
stream
seemed
to
glide
beneath
its
high
banks
the
wounded
birds
flying
low
on
the
water
had
hardly
dropped
when
they
disappeared
sucked
beneath
by
the
strong
current
and
whirled
past
us
in
less
time
than
it
takes
one
to
write
a
line
we
had
retrievers
with
us
who
would
face
the
waves
of
an
inland
lake
during
a
which
is
giving
a
dog
very
high
praise
indeed
but
there
was
no
canine
bayard
at
hand
to
brave
those
treacherous
depths
and
bring
out
our
game
so
the
sport
soon
ceased
for
what
was
the
good
of
shooting
the
beautiful
harmless
creatures
when
we
could
not
make
use
of
them
as
food
i
often
accompanied
f
on
his
expeditions
but
more
for
the
sake
of
companionship
than
from
any
amusement
i
found
in
the
sport
i
may
here
confess
frankly
that
i
can
not
understand
anyone
being
an
inveterate
for
of
all
monotonous
pursuits
it
is
the
most
in
its
forms
even
the
first
time
i
went
out
i
found
it
delightful
only
in
anticipation
and
this
is
the
one
midnight
excursion
which
i
shall
attempt
to
for
you
it
had
been
a
broiling
midsummer
day
too
hot
to
sit
in
the
verandah
too
hot
to
stroll
about
the
garden
or
go
for
a
ride
or
do
anything
in
fact
except
bask
like
a
lizard
in
the
warm
air
new
zealand
summer
weather
however
high
the
thermometer
is
quite
different
from
either
tropical
or
english
heat
it
is
intensely
hot
in
the
sun
but
always
cool
in
the
shade
i
never
heard
of
an
instance
of
from
exposure
to
the
sun
for
there
always
was
a
light
air
often
scarcely
perceptible
until
you
were
well
out
in
the
open
to
temper
the
fierce
vertical
rays
it
sometimes
happened
that
i
found
myself
obliged
either
for
business
or
pleasure
to
take
a
long
ride
in
the
middle
of
a
summer
day
and
my
invariable
reflection
used
to
be
it
is
not
nearly
so
hot
out
of
doors
as
one
fancies
it
would
be
then
there
is
none
of
the
stuffiness
so
often
an
accompaniment
to
our
brief
summers
bringing
lassitude
and
debility
in
its
train
the
only
disadvantage
of
an
unusually
hot
season
with
us
was
that
our
already
embrowned
complexions
took
a
deeper
shade
of
bronze
but
as
we
were
all
equally
there
was
no
one
to
throw
critical
stones
what
surprised
me
most
was
the
utter
absence
of
damp
or
miasma
after
a
blazing
day
instead
of
hurrying
in
out
of
reach
of
poisonous
vapours
as
the
must
needs
do
we
could
linger
lightly
clad
out
of
doors
listening
to
the
distant
roar
of
a
river
or
watching
the
exquisite
tints
of
the
evening
sky
i
dwell
on
this
to
explain
that
in
almost
any
other
country
there
would
have
been
risk
in
remaining
out
at
night
after
such
still
hot
days
on
this
particular
evening
during
my
first
summer
in
the
new
zealand
malvern
hills
after
we
had
watered
my
pet
flowers
near
the
house
and
speculated
a
good
deal
as
to
whether
the
mignonette
seed
had
all
been
blown
out
of
the
ground
by
the
last
or
not
f
said
i
shall
go
to
the
creek
down
the
flat
why
do
you
come
too
i
am
sure
you
would
like
it
now
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
i
am
such
a
thorough
gipsy
in
my
tastes
that
any
pursuit
which
serves
as
an
excuse
for
spending
hours
in
the
open
air
is
full
of
attraction
for
me
consequently
i
embraced
the
proposal
with
ardour
and
set
about
gathering
under
f
directions
what
seemed
to
bid
fair
to
rival
the
collection
of
an
old
merchant
first
of
all
there
was
a
muster
of
every
empty
tin
in
the
little
house
these
were
to
hold
the
of
mutton
and
worms
then
i
was
desired
to
hunt
up
all
the
odds
and
ends
of
worsted
which
lurked
in
the
a
forage
next
took
place
in
search
of
string
but
as
no
parcels
were
ever
delivered
in
that
sequestered
valley
twine
became
a
precious
and
rare
treasure
in
default
of
any
large
supply
being
obtainable
my
lamp
and
material
was
requisitioned
by
f
who
by
the
way
is
a
perfect
uhlan
for
getting
what
he
wants
when
bent
on
a
sporting
expedition
and
lastly
one
or
two
empty
were
called
for
you
will
see
the
use
of
this
heterogeneous
collection
presently
it
was
of
no
use
starting
until
the
twilight
had
darkened
into
a
cloudy
moonless
night
so
after
our
seven
supper
we
adjourned
into
the
verandah
to
watch
f
make
a
large
round
ball
such
as
children
play
with
out
of
the
scraps
of
worsted
with
which
i
had
furnished
him
instead
of
cutting
the
wool
into
lengths
however
it
was
left
in
loops
and
i
learned
that
this
is
done
to
afford
a
firm
hold
for
the
sharp
teeth
of
an
inquisitive
eel
who
might
be
tempted
to
find
out
if
this
strange
round
thing
floating
near
his
hole
would
be
good
to
eat
i
was
impatient
as
a
child
remember
it
was
my
first
expedition
and
i
thought
nine
would
never
come
for
i
had
been
told
to
go
and
dress
at
that
hour
that
is
to
say
i
was
to
change
my
usual
a
pretty
print
gown
for
a
short
linsey
skirt
strong
boots
and
gaiters
f
and
our
cadet
u
soon
appeared
clad
in
shooting
coats
instead
of
their
alpaca
costumes
and
their
trousers
stuffed
into
enormous
boots
the
upper
leathers
of
which
came
beyond
their
knees
are
we
going
into
the
water
i
timidly
inquired
oh
no
not
at
all
it
is
on
account
of
the
spaniards
no
doubt
this
sounds
very
unintelligible
to
an
english
reader
but
every
colonist
who
may
chance
to
see
my
pages
will
shiver
at
the
recollection
of
those
vegetable
defenders
of
an
unexplored
region
in
new
zealand
imagine
a
gigantic
artichoke
with
slender
instead
of
broad
leaves
set
round
in
dense
compact
order
they
vary
of
course
in
size
but
in
our
part
of
the
world
four
or
six
feet
in
circumference
and
a
couple
of
feet
high
was
the
usual
growth
to
which
they
attained
though
at
the
back
of
the
run
they
were
much
larger
spaniards
grow
in
clusters
or
patches
among
the
tussocks
on
the
plains
and
constitute
a
most
unpleasant
feature
of
the
vegetation
of
the
country
their
leaves
are
as
firm
as
bayonets
and
taper
at
the
point
to
the
fineness
of
a
needle
but
are
not
nearly
so
easily
broken
as
a
needle
would
be
no
horse
will
face
them
preferring
a
jump
at
the
cost
of
any
exertion
to
the
risk
of
a
stab
from
the
cruel
points
the
least
touch
of
this
green
bayonet
draws
blood
and
a
fall
a
spaniard
is
a
thing
to
be
remembered
all
one
life
interspersed
with
the
spaniards
are
generally
clumps
of
wild
irishman
a
straggling
sturdy
bramble
ready
to
receive
and
scratch
you
well
if
you
attempt
to
avoid
the
spaniard
weapons
especially
detrimental
to
riding
habits
are
wild
irishmen
and
there
are
fragments
of
mine
of
all
sorts
of
materials
and
colours
fluttering
now
on
their
thorny
branches
in
places
on
our
run
it
is
not
surprising
therefore
that
we
guarded
our
legs
as
well
as
we
could
against
these
foes
to
flesh
and
blood
we
are
rather
early
said
the
gentlemen
as
i
appeared
ready
and
eager
to
start
but
perhaps
it
is
all
the
better
to
enable
you
to
see
the
track
they
each
flung
an
empty
sack
over
their
shoulders
felt
in
their
pockets
to
ascertain
whether
the
matches
hooks
boxes
of
bait
were
all
there
and
then
we
set
forth
at
first
it
appeared
as
if
we
had
stepped
from
the
brightness
of
the
into
utter
and
pitchy
blackness
but
after
we
had
groped
for
a
few
steps
down
the
familiar
garden
path
our
eyes
became
accustomed
to
the
subdued
light
of
the
soft
summer
night
although
heavy
banks
of
cloud
the
general
precursors
of
wind
were
moving
slowly
between
us
and
the
heavens
the
stars
shone
down
through
their
rifts
and
on
the
western
horizon
a
faint
yellowish
tinge
told
us
that
daylight
was
in
no
hurry
to
leave
our
quiet
valley
the
mountain
streams
or
creeks
which
water
so
well
the
grassy
plains
among
the
malvern
hills
are
not
affected
to
any
considerable
extent
by
dry
summer
weather
they
are
from
the
high
ranges
and
each
restores
many
a
glacier
or
avalanche
to
its
original
form
and
sends
it
flowing
down
the
steep
sides
of
yonder
distant
beautiful
mountains
to
join
the
creeks
which
like
a
tangled
skein
of
silver
threads
ensure
a
good
water
supply
to
the
new
zealand
in
the
holes
under
steep
overhanging
banks
the
eels
love
to
lurk
hiding
from
the
sun
rays
in
cool
depths
and
coming
out
at
night
to
feed
there
are
no
fish
whatever
in
the
rivers
and
i
fear
that
the
labours
of
the
acclimatization
society
will
be
thrown
away
until
they
can
persuade
the
streams
themselves
to
remain
in
their
beds
like
more
civilised
waters
at
present
not
a
month
passes
that
one
does
not
hear
of
some
eccentric
proceeding
on
the
part
of
either
rivers
or
creeks
unless
the
fish
are
prepared
to
shift
their
liquid
quarters
at
a
moment
notice
they
will
find
themselves
often
left
high
and
dry
on
the
deserted
but
eels
are
proverbially
accustomed
to
adapt
themselves
to
circumstances
and
a
fisherman
may
always
count
on
getting
some
if
he
be
patient
about
a
mile
down
the
flat
between
very
high
banks
our
principal
creek
ran
and
to
a
quiet
spot
among
the
we
directed
our
steps
by
the
light
the
gentlemen
set
their
lines
in
very
primitive
fashion
on
the
crumbling
rotten
earth
the
new
zealand
flax
the
loves
to
grow
and
to
its
long
leaves
the
fastened
their
lines
securely
baiting
each
alternate
hook
with
mutton
and
worms
i
declared
this
was
too
cockney
a
method
of
fishing
and
selected
a
tall
slender
the
stalk
of
last
year
spike
of
red
blossoms
and
to
this
extempore
rod
i
fastened
my
line
and
bait
when
one
considers
that
the
old
whalers
were
accustomed
to
use
ropes
made
in
the
rudest
fashion
from
the
fibre
of
this
very
plant
in
their
fishing
for
very
big
prey
it
is
not
surprising
that
we
found
it
sufficiently
strong
for
our
purpose
i
picked
out
therefore
a
comfortable
spot
that
is
to
say
well
in
the
centre
of
a
young
whose
satiny
leaves
made
the
most
elastic
cushions
around
me
with
my
held
out
over
what
was
supposed
to
be
a
favourite
haunt
of
the
eels
and
with
nettle
asleep
at
my
feet
and
a
warm
shawl
close
to
my
hand
prepared
for
my
vigil
do
speak
or
move
were
the
gentlemen
last
words
the
eels
are
all
eyes
and
ears
at
this
hour
they
can
almost
hear
you
breathe
each
man
then
took
up
his
position
a
few
hundred
yards
away
from
me
so
that
i
felt
to
all
intents
and
purposes
absolutely
alone
i
am
free
to
confess
as
our
american
cousins
say
that
it
was
a
very
eerie
sensation
it
was
now
past
ten
the
darkness
was
intense
and
the
silence
as
deep
as
the
darkness
hot
as
the
day
had
been
the
night
air
felt
chill
and
a
heavy
dew
began
to
fall
showing
me
the
wisdom
of
substituting
woollen
for
cotton
garments
i
could
see
the
dim
outlines
of
the
high
hills
which
shut
in
our
happy
valley
on
all
sides
and
the
smell
of
the
earth
of
a
paddock
near
the
house
which
was
in
process
of
being
broken
up
for
english
grass
came
stealing
towards
me
on
the
silent
air
the
melancholy
cry
of
a
bittern
or
the
shrill
wail
of
the
weka
startled
me
from
time
to
time
but
there
was
no
other
sound
to
break
the
eternal
silence
as
i
waited
and
watched
i
thought
as
every
one
must
surely
think
with
strange
paradoxical
feelings
of
one
own
utter
insignificance
in
creation
mingled
with
the
delightful
consciousness
of
our
individual
importance
in
the
eyes
of
the
maker
and
father
of
all
an
atom
among
worlds
as
one
feels
sitting
there
at
such
an
hour
and
in
such
a
spot
still
we
remember
with
love
and
pride
that
not
a
hair
of
our
head
falls
to
the
ground
unnoticed
by
an
infinite
love
and
an
eternal
providence
the
soul
tries
to
fly
into
the
boundless
regions
of
space
and
eternity
and
to
gaze
upon
other
worlds
and
other
beings
equally
the
object
of
the
great
creator
care
but
her
mortal
wing
soon
droops
and
tires
and
she
is
fain
to
nestle
home
again
to
her
saviour
arms
with
the
thought
i
am
my
beloved
and
he
is
mine
that
is
the
only
safe
beginning
and
end
of
all
speculation
it
was
very
solemn
and
beautiful
that
long
dark
night
a
pause
amid
the
bustle
of
every
day
cares
and
duties
hours
in
which
one
takes
counsel
with
one
own
heart
and
is
still
midnight
had
come
and
gone
when
the
sputter
and
snap
of
striking
a
match
which
sounded
almost
like
a
pistol
shot
amid
the
profound
silence
told
me
that
one
of
the
sportsmen
had
been
successful
i
got
up
as
softly
as
possible
wrapped
my
damp
shawl
round
my
still
damper
shoulders
and
fastening
the
securely
in
the
ground
stole
along
the
bank
of
the
creek
towards
the
place
where
a
blazing
tussock
serving
as
a
torch
showed
the
successful
struggling
with
his
prize
through
the
gloom
i
saw
another
figure
running
silently
in
the
same
direction
for
the
fact
was
we
were
all
so
cramped
and
cold
and
weary
of
sitting
waiting
for
bites
which
never
came
that
we
hailed
with
delight
a
break
in
the
monotony
of
our
watch
it
did
not
matter
now
how
much
noise
we
made
within
moderate
limits
for
the
peace
of
that
portion
of
the
creek
was
destroyed
for
the
night
eels
must
have
banded
themselves
together
and
made
a
sudden
and
furious
dash
at
the
worsted
ball
which
u
had
been
dangling
in
front
of
their
mud
for
the
last
two
hours
just
as
he
had
intended
their
long
sharp
teeth
became
entangled
in
the
worsted
loops
and
although
he
declared
some
had
broken
away
and
escaped
three
or
four
ones
remained
struggling
frantically
it
would
have
been
almost
impossible
for
one
man
to
lift
such
a
weight
straight
out
of
the
water
by
a
string
and
as
we
came
up
and
saw
u
agitated
face
in
the
fantastic
flickering
light
of
the
blazing
tussock
which
he
had
set
on
fire
as
a
signal
of
distress
i
involuntarily
thought
of
the
old
joe
miller
about
the
tartar
why
you
let
him
go
because
he
has
caught
it
looked
just
like
that
the
furious
splashing
in
the
water
below
and
u
grasping
his
line
with
desperate
valour
but
being
gradually
drawn
nearer
to
the
edge
of
the
steep
bank
each
instant
keep
up
a
good
light
but
not
too
much
cried
f
to
me
in
a
regular
as
he
rushed
to
the
rescue
so
i
pulled
up
one
tussock
after
another
by
its
roots
an
exertion
which
resulted
in
upsetting
me
each
time
and
lighted
one
as
fast
as
its
predecessor
burned
out
they
were
all
rather
damp
so
they
did
not
flare
away
too
quickly
by
the
blaze
of
my
grassy
torches
i
saw
f
first
seize
u
round
the
waist
and
drag
him
further
from
the
bank
but
the
latter
called
out
it
my
hands
they
have
no
skin
left
do
catch
hold
there
a
good
fellow
so
the
good
fellow
did
catch
hold
but
he
was
too
experienced
an
to
try
to
lift
a
couple
of
dozen
pounds
weight
of
eels
out
of
the
water
by
a
perpendicular
string
so
he
tied
it
to
a
near
and
stooping
down
in
order
to
get
some
leverage
over
the
bank
very
soon
drew
the
ball
with
its
slimy
wriggling
captives
out
of
the
water
just
as
he
jerked
it
far
on
shore
one
or
two
of
the
creatures
broke
loose
and
escaped
leaving
quite
enough
to
afford
a
most
disgusting
and
horrible
sight
as
they
were
shuffled
and
poked
into
the
empty
the
sportsmen
were
delighted
however
and
departed
to
a
fresh
bend
of
the
creek
leaving
me
to
find
my
way
back
to
my
original
post
this
would
have
been
difficult
indeed
had
not
nettle
remained
behind
to
guard
my
gloves
which
i
had
left
in
his
custody
as
i
passed
not
knowing
i
was
so
near
the
spot
the
little
dog
gave
a
low
whimper
of
greeting
sufficient
to
attract
my
attention
and
guide
me
to
where
he
was
keeping
his
faithful
watch
and
ward
i
felt
for
my
and
moved
it
ever
so
gently
a
sudden
jerk
and
splash
startled
me
horribly
and
warned
me
that
i
had
disturbed
an
eel
who
was
in
the
act
of
supping
off
my
bait
in
the
momentary
surprise
i
suppose
i
let
go
for
certain
it
is
that
the
next
instant
my
was
rapidly
towed
down
the
stream
instead
of
feeling
provoked
or
mortified
it
was
the
greatest
relief
to
know
that
my
was
over
for
the
night
and
that
now
i
had
nothing
to
do
except
wait
till
called
for
so
i
took
nettle
on
my
lap
and
tried
to
abide
patiently
but
i
had
not
been
long
enough
in
new
zealand
to
have
any
confidence
in
the
climate
and
as
i
felt
how
damp
my
clothes
were
and
recollected
with
horror
my
west
indian
experiences
of
the
consequences
of
exposure
to
night
air
and
heavy
dew
my
mind
dwell
gloomily
on
the
prospect
of
a
fever
at
least
it
seemed
a
long
and
weary
while
before
i
perceived
a
figure
coming
towards
me
and
i
am
afraid
i
was
both
cross
and
cold
and
sleepy
by
the
time
we
set
our
faces
homewards
i
have
only
caught
three
said
f
how
many
have
you
got
none
i
am
happy
to
say
i
answered
peevishly
what
could
nettle
and
i
have
done
with
the
horrible
things
if
we
had
caught
any
the
walk
or
rather
the
stumble
home
proved
to
be
the
worst
part
of
the
expedition
not
a
ray
of
starlight
had
we
to
guide
us
nothing
but
inky
blackness
around
and
over
us
we
tried
to
make
nettle
go
first
intending
to
follow
his
lead
and
trusting
to
his
keeping
the
track
but
nettle
place
was
at
my
heels
and
neither
coaxing
nor
scolding
would
induce
him
to
forego
it
a
forlorn
hope
was
nothing
to
the
dangers
of
each
footstep
first
one
and
then
the
other
volunteered
to
lead
the
way
declaring
they
could
find
the
track
all
this
time
we
were
trying
to
strike
the
indistinct
road
among
the
tussocks
made
by
occasional
wheels
to
our
house
but
the
marks
never
very
distinct
in
daylight
became
perfect
at
night
if
we
crossed
a
we
joyfully
announced
that
we
had
found
the
way
but
only
to
be
undeceived
the
next
moment
by
discovering
that
we
were
returning
to
the
creek
from
time
to
time
we
fell
into
and
over
spaniards
and
what
was
left
of
our
clothes
and
our
flesh
the
wild
irishmen
devoured
we
must
have
got
home
somehow
or
i
should
not
be
writing
an
account
of
it
at
this
moment
but
really
i
hardly
know
how
we
reached
the
house
i
recollect
that
the
next
day
there
was
a
great
demand
for
skin
and
and
that
whenever
f
and
u
had
a
spare
moment
during
the
ensuing
week
they
devoted
themselves
to
performing
surgical
operations
on
each
other
with
a
needle
and
that
i
felt
very
subdued
and
tired
for
a
day
or
two
but
there
was
no
question
of
fever
or
cold
and
i
was
stared
at
when
i
inquired
whether
it
was
not
dangerous
to
be
out
all
night
in
heavy
dew
after
a
broiling
day
we
had
the
eels
made
into
a
pie
by
our
shepherd
who
assured
me
that
if
i
entrusted
them
to
my
cook
she
would
send
me
up
such
an
oily
dish
that
i
should
never
be
able
to
endure
an
eel
again
he
declared
that
the
maoris
who
seem
to
have
rather
a
horror
of
grease
had
taught
him
how
to
cook
both
eels
and
wekas
in
such
a
way
as
to
eliminate
every
particle
of
fat
from
both
i
had
no
experience
of
the
latter
dish
but
he
certainly
kept
his
word
about
the
eels
for
they
were
excellent
chapter
iii
it
was
much
too
hot
in
summer
to
go
after
wild
pigs
that
was
our
winter
amusement
and
very
good
sport
it
afforded
us
besides
the
pleasure
of
knowing
that
we
were
really
doing
good
service
to
the
pastoral
interest
by
ridding
the
hills
around
us
of
almost
the
only
enemies
which
the
sheep
have
if
the
squatter
goes
to
look
after
his
mob
of
ewes
and
lambs
in
the
sheltered
slopes
at
the
back
of
his
run
he
is
pretty
nearly
certain
to
find
them
attended
by
an
old
sow
with
a
dozen
babies
at
her
heels
she
will
follow
the
sheep
patiently
from
one
camping
ground
to
another
watching
for
a
and
weakly
lamb
to
linger
behind
the
rest
and
then
she
will
seize
and
devour
it
besides
this
danger
the
presence
of
pigs
on
the
run
keeps
the
sheep
in
an
excited
state
they
have
an
uneasy
consciousness
that
their
foes
are
looking
after
them
and
they
move
restlessly
up
and
down
the
hills
not
stopping
to
feed
sufficiently
to
get
fat
if
a
thinks
his
sheep
are
not
in
good
condition
one
of
the
first
questions
he
asks
his
shepherd
is
are
there
any
pigs
about
our
run
had
a
good
many
of
these
troublesome
visitors
on
it
especially
in
the
winter
when
they
would
travel
down
from
the
back
country
to
grub
up
acres
on
acres
of
splendid
sheep
pasture
in
search
of
roots
the
only
good
they
do
is
to
dig
up
the
spaniards
for
the
sake
of
their
delicious
white
fibres
and
the
fact
of
their
being
able
to
do
this
will
give
a
better
idea
of
the
toughness
of
a
wild
pig
snout
than
anything
else
i
can
say
it
may
be
strange
to
english
ears
to
hear
a
woman
of
tolerably
peaceful
disposition
and
as
the
advertisements
in
the
so
often
state
thoroughly
domesticated
aver
that
she
found
great
pleasure
in
going
after
wild
pigs
but
the
circumstances
of
the
ease
must
be
taken
into
consideration
before
i
am
condemned
first
of
all
it
seemed
terribly
lonely
at
home
if
f
was
out
with
his
rifle
all
day
next
there
was
the
temptation
to
spend
those
delicious
hours
of
a
new
zealand
day
between
ten
and
four
out
of
doors
wandering
over
hills
and
exploring
new
gullies
and
lastly
i
had
a
firm
idea
that
i
was
taking
care
of
f
and
so
i
was
in
a
certain
sense
for
if
his
rifle
had
burst
or
any
accident
had
happened
to
him
and
he
had
been
unable
to
reach
the
homestead
we
should
never
have
known
where
to
find
him
and
days
would
probably
have
passed
before
every
nook
and
corner
of
a
run
extending
over
many
thousand
acres
could
have
been
thoroughly
searched
i
had
heard
terrible
stories
of
shepherds
slipping
down
and
injuring
themselves
so
that
they
could
not
move
and
of
their
dead
bodies
being
only
found
after
weeks
of
careful
seeking
f
himself
delighted
to
terrify
me
by
descriptions
of
narrow
escapes
and
as
the
pigs
had
to
be
killed
i
resolved
to
follow
in
the
hunter
train
the
sport
is
conducted
exactly
like
deer
stalking
only
it
is
much
harder
work
and
a
huge
boar
is
not
so
picturesque
an
object
as
a
stag
of
many
tines
when
you
do
catch
sight
of
him
there
is
just
the
same
accurate
knowledge
needed
of
the
animal
habits
and
customs
and
the
same
untiring
patience
it
is
quite
as
necessary
to
be
a
good
shot
for
a
grey
pig
standing
under
the
lee
of
a
boulder
of
exactly
his
own
colour
is
a
much
more
difficult
object
to
hit
from
the
opposite
side
of
a
ravine
than
a
stag
and
a
wild
boar
is
every
whit
as
keen
of
scent
and
sharp
of
eye
and
ear
as
any
antlered
monarch
of
the
glen
imagine
then
a
beautiful
winter
morning
without
wind
or
rain
there
has
been
perhaps
a
sharp
frost
but
after
a
couple
of
hours
of
sunshine
the
air
is
as
warm
and
bright
as
midsummer
we
used
to
be
glad
enough
of
a
wood
fire
at
breakfast
but
after
that
meal
had
been
eaten
we
went
into
the
verandah
open
to
the
our
warm
quarter
which
made
a
delicious
winter
parlour
and
basked
in
the
blazing
sunshine
i
used
often
to
bring
out
a
chair
and
a
table
and
work
and
read
there
all
the
morning
without
either
hat
or
jacket
but
it
sometimes
happened
that
once
or
twice
a
week
on
just
such
a
lovely
morning
f
would
proclaim
his
intention
of
going
out
to
look
for
pigs
and
sooner
than
be
left
behind
i
nearly
always
begged
to
be
allowed
to
come
too
there
was
no
fear
of
my
getting
tired
or
lagging
behind
and
as
i
was
willing
to
make
myself
generally
useful
by
carrying
the
telescope
a
revolver
for
close
quarters
and
eke
a
few
sandwiches
the
offer
of
my
company
used
to
be
graciously
accepted
we
could
seldom
procure
the
loan
of
a
good
and
after
one
excursion
with
a
certain
dog
of
the
name
of
pincher
i
preferred
going
out
by
ourselves
on
that
occasion
f
did
not
take
his
rifle
as
there
was
no
chance
of
getting
a
long
shot
at
our
game
for
the
dog
would
surely
bring
the
pig
to
bay
and
then
the
hunter
must
trust
to
a
revolver
or
the
colonial
half
a
pair
of
shears
i
suppose
it
should
be
called
bound
firmly
on
a
flax
stick
by
green
we
had
heard
of
pigs
having
been
seen
by
our
shepherd
at
the
back
of
the
run
and
as
we
were
not
encumbered
by
the
heavy
rifle
we
mounted
our
horses
and
rode
as
far
as
we
could
towards
the
range
where
the
pigs
had
been
grubbing
up
the
hill
sides
in
unmolested
security
for
some
time
past
five
miles
from
home
the
ground
became
so
rough
that
our
horses
could
go
no
further
we
therefore
jumped
off
tied
them
to
a
taking
off
the
saddles
in
case
they
broke
loose
and
proceeded
on
foot
over
the
jungly
saddle
on
the
other
side
we
came
upon
a
beautiful
gully
with
a
creek
running
through
it
whose
banks
were
so
densely
fringed
with
scrub
that
we
could
not
get
through
to
the
stream
which
we
heard
rippling
amid
the
tangled
shrubs
if
we
could
only
have
reached
the
water
our
best
plan
would
have
been
to
get
into
it
and
follow
its
windings
up
the
ravine
but
even
pincher
could
hardly
squeeze
and
burrow
through
the
impenetrable
fence
of
matapo
and
goi
which
were
woven
together
by
fibres
of
a
thorny
creeper
called
a
lawyer
by
the
shepherds
it
was
very
tantalising
for
in
less
than
five
minutes
we
heard
trusty
pincher
speaking
to
a
boar
and
knew
that
he
had
baled
it
up
against
a
tree
and
was
calling
to
us
to
come
and
help
him
f
ran
about
like
a
lunatic
calling
out
coming
pincher
round
him
up
good
dog
and
so
forth
but
they
were
all
vain
promises
for
he
could
not
get
in
i
did
my
best
in
searching
for
an
opening
and
gave
many
false
hopes
of
having
found
one
at
last
i
said
if
i
run
up
the
mountain
side
and
look
down
on
that
mass
of
scrub
perhaps
i
may
see
some
way
into
it
from
above
no
do
you
stay
here
and
see
if
the
pig
breaks
cover
which
way
he
goes
up
the
steep
hill
therefore
f
rushed
as
swiftly
and
lightly
as
one
of
his
own
mountain
sheep
and
in
a
minute
or
two
i
saw
him
standing
revolver
in
hand
on
an
overhanging
rock
peering
anxiously
down
on
the
leafy
mass
below
pincher
and
the
creek
made
such
a
noise
between
them
that
i
could
not
hear
what
f
said
and
only
guessed
from
his
despairing
gestures
that
there
was
no
trap
door
visible
in
the
green
roof
i
signalled
as
well
as
i
could
that
he
was
to
come
down
directly
for
looked
most
insecure
insecure
indeed
it
proved
as
i
spoke
the
great
fragment
of
rock
loosely
embedded
in
earth
on
the
mountain
side
gave
way
with
a
crash
and
came
tumbling
majestically
down
on
the
top
of
the
scrub
as
for
f
he
described
a
series
of
somersaults
in
the
air
which
however
agreeable
in
themselves
were
very
trying
to
the
nerves
of
the
spectatrix
below
my
first
dread
was
least
the
rock
should
crush
him
but
to
my
great
joy
i
saw
at
once
that
it
was
rolling
slowly
down
the
hill
whilst
f
vigorous
bound
off
it
as
it
gave
way
had
carried
him
well
into
the
middle
of
the
leafy
cushion
beneath
him
where
he
presently
landed
flat
on
his
back
i
expected
every
moment
to
hear
the
revolver
go
off
but
mercifully
it
did
not
do
so
and
as
his
thorny
bed
was
hardly
to
be
endured
f
soon
kicked
himself
off
it
and
before
i
could
realize
that
he
was
unhurt
had
scrambled
to
his
feet
and
was
rushing
off
crying
in
glee
that
will
fetch
him
out
that
the
rock
certainly
did
fetch
him
the
pig
out
in
a
moment
and
pincher
availed
himself
of
the
general
confusion
to
seize
hold
of
his
enemy
hind
leg
which
he
never
afterwards
let
go
the
boar
kept
snapping
and
champing
his
great
tusks
but
pincher
even
with
the
leg
in
his
mouth
was
too
active
to
be
caught
so
as
the
boar
found
that
it
was
both
futile
and
undignified
to
try
to
run
away
with
a
dog
hanging
on
his
he
tried
another
plan
making
for
a
clump
of
palms
he
went
to
bay
and
contrived
to
take
up
a
very
good
defensive
position
pincher
would
have
never
given
up
his
mouthful
of
leg
if
f
had
not
called
him
off
for
it
seemed
impossible
to
fire
the
revolver
whilst
the
dog
held
on
this
change
of
tactics
was
much
against
pincher
judgment
and
he
kept
rushing
furiously
in
between
f
and
the
boar
as
for
me
i
prudently
retired
behind
a
big
boulder
on
which
i
could
climb
if
the
worst
came
to
the
worst
and
called
out
from
time
to
time
to
both
dog
and
man
oh
do
they
did
not
even
hear
me
for
the
din
of
battle
was
loud
the
pig
dodged
about
so
fast
that
although
f
bullets
lodged
in
the
palm
tree
at
his
back
not
one
struck
a
vulnerable
part
and
at
last
f
casting
his
revolver
behind
him
for
me
to
pick
up
and
reload
closed
with
his
foe
armed
only
with
the
pincher
considered
this
too
dangerous
and
rushed
in
between
them
to
distract
the
attention
just
as
f
aimed
a
thrust
at
his
chest
for
it
was
of
no
use
trying
to
penetrate
his
hide
the
boar
lowered
his
head
caught
poor
faithful
pincher
exposed
flank
and
tore
it
open
with
his
tusk
but
in
the
meantime
the
spear
had
gone
well
home
into
his
brawny
chest
exactly
beneath
the
left
shoulder
and
his
came
gushing
out
i
was
so
infuriated
at
the
sight
of
frightful
wound
that
i
felt
none
of
my
usual
pity
for
the
victim
and
rushing
up
to
f
with
the
revolver
of
which
only
a
couple
of
chambers
were
loaded
thrust
it
into
his
hand
with
an
entreaty
to
kill
him
quickly
this
f
was
quite
willing
to
do
for
his
own
sake
as
a
wounded
boar
is
about
the
most
dangerous
beast
on
earth
and
although
the
poor
brute
kept
snapping
at
the
broken
sticking
in
his
heart
he
fired
a
steady
shot
which
brought
the
pig
on
his
knees
only
to
roll
over
dead
the
next
moment
i
can
not
help
pausing
to
say
that
i
sewed
up
pincher
wound
then
and
there
with
some
of
the
contents
of
my
cambusmore
which
always
accompanied
me
on
my
sporting
expeditions
and
we
carried
him
between
us
down
to
where
the
horses
were
fastened
there
i
mounted
and
f
lifting
the
faithful
creature
on
my
lap
we
rode
slowly
home
dipping
our
handkerchiefs
in
cold
water
at
every
creek
we
crossed
and
laying
them
on
his
poor
flank
he
was
as
patient
and
brave
as
possible
and
bore
his
sufferings
and
weakness
for
days
afterwards
in
a
way
which
was
a
lesson
to
one
so
grateful
and
gentle
was
he
his
brave
and
sensible
behaviour
met
its
due
reward
in
a
complete
though
slow
recovery
i
have
only
left
myself
space
for
one
little
sketch
more
but
it
comes
so
vividly
before
me
that
i
can
not
shut
it
out
after
a
long
walking
over
the
hills
and
vallies
so
beautiful
beneath
our
azure
walking
which
was
delightful
as
an
expedition
but
unsuccessful
as
to
sport
we
crossed
the
track
of
a
large
boar
we
knew
he
was
old
by
his
being
alone
and
it
was
therefore
very
certain
that
he
would
show
fight
if
we
came
up
with
him
patiently
we
followed
the
track
over
a
low
saddle
through
a
clump
of
brushwood
menuka
the
broken
twigs
of
which
showed
how
large
an
animal
had
just
passed
by
here
and
there
a
freshly
spaniard
showed
where
he
had
paused
for
a
snack
but
at
length
we
dropped
down
on
the
river
bed
with
its
wide
expanse
of
shingle
and
there
we
lost
all
clue
to
our
game
after
a
little
hesitation
f
decided
on
climbing
a
high
cliff
on
the
right
bank
of
the
river
and
trying
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
him
the
opposite
was
gaunt
and
bare
a
southern
aspect
shut
out
the
sun
in
winter
and
for
all
its
rich
traces
of
copper
ore
head
found
no
favour
in
the
eyes
of
either
shepherds
or
master
grass
would
not
grow
there
except
in
summer
and
its
gray
shingly
sides
were
an
to
its
owner
we
sat
down
on
the
cliff
and
looked
around
carefully
presently
f
said
in
a
breathless
whisper
of
intense
delight
i
see
him
in
vain
i
looked
and
looked
but
nothing
could
my
stupid
eyes
discover
lie
down
said
f
to
me
just
as
if
i
had
been
a
dog
i
crouched
as
low
as
possible
whilst
f
settled
himself
comfortably
flat
on
his
stomach
and
prepared
to
take
a
careful
aim
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
hill
after
what
seemed
a
long
time
he
pulled
his
rifle
trigger
and
the
flash
and
crack
was
followed
apparently
by
one
of
the
gray
boulders
opposite
leaping
up
and
then
rolling
heavily
down
the
hill
f
jumped
up
in
triumph
crying
come
along
and
do
forget
the
revolver
when
we
had
crossed
the
river
reckless
of
getting
wet
to
our
waists
in
water
f
took
the
revolver
from
me
and
went
first
but
after
an
instant
examination
he
called
out
dead
as
a
come
and
look
at
him
so
i
came
with
great
caution
and
a
more
repulsive
and
disgusting
sight
can
not
be
imagined
than
the
huge
carcass
of
our
victim
already
stiffening
in
death
the
shot
had
been
a
fortunate
one
for
only
an
inch
away
from
the
hole
the
bullet
had
made
his
shoulders
were
regularly
plated
with
thick
horny
scales
off
which
a
revolver
bullet
would
have
glanced
harmlessly
and
he
bore
marks
of
having
fought
many
and
many
a
battle
with
younger
rivals
his
huge
tusks
were
notched
and
broken
and
he
had
evidently
been
driven
out
from
among
his
fellows
as
a
quarrelsome
member
of
their
society
already
the
hawks
were
hovering
above
the
great
monster
and
we
left
him
to
his
fate
in
the
solitary
river
gorge
where
all
was
bleak
and
cold
and
gloomy
a
fitting
for
the
fierce
old
warrior
chapter
iv
skating
in
the
back
country
i
do
not
believe
that
even
in
canada
the
skating
can
be
better
than
that
which
was
within
our
reach
in
the
malvern
hills
among
our
sheltered
valleys
an
sunny
slopes
the
hardest
frost
only
lasted
a
few
hour
after
dawn
but
miles
further
back
on
the
border
of
the
glacier
region
the
mountain
tarns
could
boast
of
ice
several
feet
thick
all
the
winter
we
heard
rumours
of
lakes
across
which
could
pass
in
perfect
safety
for
three
months
of
the
year
and
we
grumbled
at
the
light
film
over
our
own
large
ponds
which
would
not
bear
even
my
little
terrier
weight
after
and
yet
it
was
cold
enough
at
night
during
our
short
bright
winters
to
satisfy
the
most
person
i
think
i
have
mentioned
before
that
the
wooden
houses
in
new
zealand
especially
those
roughly
put
together
are
by
no
means
disagreeable
as
this
may
be
it
is
doubtless
the
reason
of
the
extraordinary
immunity
from
colds
and
coughs
which
we
enjoyed
living
between
walls
formed
by
each
other
and
which
can
only
be
made
to
resemble
english
rooms
by
being
canvassed
and
papered
inside
the
pure
fresh
air
finds
its
way
in
on
all
sides
a
hot
room
in
winter
is
an
impossibility
in
spite
of
drawn
curtains
and
blazing
fires
therefore
the
risk
of
sudden
changes
of
temperature
is
avoided
some
such
theory
as
this
is
absolutely
necessary
to
account
for
the
wonderfully
good
health
enjoyed
by
all
in
the
most
capricious
and
trying
climate
i
have
ever
come
across
when
a
strong
was
howling
down
the
glen
i
have
seen
the
pictures
on
my
walls
blowing
out
to
an
angle
of
degrees
although
every
door
and
window
in
the
little
low
wooden
structure
had
been
carefully
closed
for
hours
it
has
happened
to
me
more
than
once
on
getting
up
in
the
morning
to
find
my
clothes
which
had
been
laid
on
a
chair
beneath
my
bedroom
window
overnight
completely
covered
by
powdered
snow
drifting
in
through
the
casement
this
same
window
was
within
a
couple
of
feet
of
my
bed
and
between
me
and
it
was
neither
curtain
nor
shelter
of
any
sort
of
a
winter
evening
i
have
often
been
obliged
to
wrap
myself
up
in
a
big
scotch
maud
as
i
sat
dressed
in
a
high
linsey
gown
by
a
blazing
fire
so
hard
was
the
frost
outside
but
by
ten
next
morning
i
would
be
loitering
about
the
verandah
basking
in
the
sunshine
and
watching
the
light
flecks
of
and
veils
floating
against
an
sky
yet
such
is
the
inherent
discontent
of
the
human
heart
that
instead
of
rejoicing
in
this
lovely
sunshine
we
actually
mourned
over
the
vanished
ice
which
at
daylight
had
been
found
by
a
early
riser
strong
enough
to
slide
on
for
half
an
hour
it
seemed
almost
impossible
to
believe
that
any
one
had
been
sliding
that
morning
within
a
few
feet
of
where
i
sat
working
in
a
blaze
of
sunshine
with
my
pretty
grey
and
pink
australian
parrot
pluming
itself
on
the
branch
of
a
silver
wattle
close
by
and
joey
the
tiny
monkey
from
panama
sitting
on
the
skirt
of
my
gown
with
a
piece
of
its
folds
arranged
by
himself
over
his
glossy
black
shoulders
if
either
of
these
tropical
pets
had
been
left
out
after
four
that
sunny
day
they
would
have
been
frozen
to
death
before
our
supper
time
it
was
just
on
such
a
day
as
this
and
in
just
such
a
bright
hour
that
a
distant
neighbour
of
ours
rode
up
to
the
garden
gate
leading
a
pack
horse
outside
the
with
which
this
animal
was
somewhat
heavily
laden
could
be
plainly
seen
a
beautiful
new
pair
of
oxford
skates
glinting
in
the
sunshine
and
it
must
have
been
the
sight
of
these
beloved
implements
which
called
forth
the
remark
from
one
of
the
gentlemen
i
suppose
you
have
lots
of
skating
up
at
your
place
well
not
exactly
at
my
station
but
there
is
a
capital
lake
ten
miles
from
my
house
where
i
am
sure
of
a
good
day
skating
any
time
between
june
and
august
answered
h
our
newly
arrived
guest
we
all
looked
at
each
other
i
believe
i
heaved
a
deep
sigh
and
dropped
my
thimble
which
joey
instantly
seized
and
with
a
low
chirrup
of
intense
delight
commenced
to
poke
down
between
the
boards
of
the
verandah
it
was
too
bad
of
us
to
give
such
broad
hints
by
looks
if
not
by
words
poor
h
was
a
bachelor
in
those
days
he
had
not
been
at
his
little
homestead
for
some
weeks
and
was
ignorant
of
its
resources
in
the
way
of
firing
always
an
important
matter
at
a
station
or
even
of
tea
and
mutton
he
had
no
and
was
totally
unprepared
for
an
incursion
of
skaters
and
yet
new
zealand
fashion
no
sooner
did
he
perceive
that
we
were
all
longing
and
pining
for
some
skating
than
he
invited
us
all
most
cordially
to
go
up
to
his
run
the
very
next
day
with
him
and
skate
as
long
as
we
liked
this
was
indeed
a
delightful
prospect
the
more
especially
as
it
happened
to
be
only
monday
which
gave
us
plenty
of
time
to
be
back
again
by
sunday
for
our
weekly
service
we
made
it
a
rule
never
to
be
away
from
home
on
that
day
lest
any
of
our
distant
congregation
should
ride
their
twenty
miles
or
so
across
country
and
find
us
absent
when
the
host
is
willing
and
the
guests
eager
it
does
not
take
long
to
arrange
a
plan
so
the
next
morning
found
three
of
us
besides
h
mounted
and
ready
to
start
directly
after
breakfast
i
have
often
been
asked
how
i
managed
in
those
days
about
toilette
arrangements
when
it
was
impossible
to
carry
any
luggage
except
a
small
swag
closely
packed
in
a
waterproof
case
and
fastened
on
the
same
side
as
the
first
of
all
i
must
assure
my
lady
readers
that
i
prided
myself
on
turning
out
as
neat
and
natty
as
possible
at
the
end
of
the
journey
and
yet
i
rode
not
only
in
my
linsey
gown
which
could
be
made
long
or
short
at
pleasure
but
in
my
crinoline
this
was
artfully
looped
up
on
the
right
side
and
tied
by
a
ribbon
in
such
a
way
that
when
i
came
out
ready
dressed
to
mount
no
one
in
the
world
could
have
guessed
that
i
had
on
any
beneath
my
short
riding
habit
with
a
loose
tweed
jacket
over
the
body
of
the
dress
within
the
swag
was
stowed
a
brush
and
comb
collar
cuffs
and
handkerchiefs
a
little
necessary
linen
a
pair
of
shoes
and
perhaps
a
ribbon
for
my
hair
if
i
meant
to
be
very
smart
on
this
occasion
we
all
found
that
our
skates
occupied
a
terribly
large
proportion
both
of
weight
and
space
in
our
modest
kits
but
still
we
were
much
too
happy
to
grumble
where
could
you
find
a
gayer
quartette
than
started
at
an
easy
canter
up
the
valley
that
fresh
bracing
morning
from
the
very
first
our
faces
were
turned
to
the
and
before
us
rose
the
magnificent
chain
of
the
southern
alps
with
their
bold
snowy
peaks
standing
out
in
a
glorious
dazzle
against
the
cobalt
sky
a
stranger
or
colonially
speaking
a
new
chum
would
have
thought
we
must
needs
cross
that
before
we
could
penetrate
any
distance
into
the
back
country
but
we
knew
of
long
winding
vallies
and
gullies
running
up
between
the
giant
slopes
which
would
lead
us
almost
without
our
knowing
how
high
we
had
climbed
up
to
the
elevated
but
sheltered
plateau
among
the
back
country
ranges
where
h
homestead
stood
there
was
only
one
steep
saddle
to
be
crossed
and
that
lay
between
us
and
rockwood
six
miles
off
it
was
the
worst
part
of
the
journey
for
the
horses
so
we
had
easy
consciences
in
dismounting
and
waiting
an
hour
when
we
reached
that
most
charming
and
hospitable
of
houses
i
had
just
time
for
one
turn
round
the
beautiful
garden
where
the
flowers
and
shrubs
of
old
england
grew
side
by
side
with
the
wild
and
lovely
blossoms
of
our
new
island
home
when
the
expected
rang
out
shrill
and
clear
from
the
porch
it
was
but
little
past
when
we
made
our
second
start
and
set
seriously
to
work
over
fifteen
miles
of
fairly
good
galloping
ground
this
distance
brought
us
well
up
to
the
foot
of
a
high
range
and
the
last
six
miles
of
the
journey
had
to
be
accomplished
in
single
file
and
with
great
care
and
discretion
for
the
track
led
through
bleak
desolate
vallies
round
the
shoulder
of
abutting
spurs
through
swamps
and
up
and
down
rocky
staircases
h
and
his
cob
both
knew
the
way
well
however
and
my
bay
mare
helen
had
the
cleverest
legs
and
the
wisest
as
well
as
prettiest
head
of
her
race
if
left
to
herself
she
seldom
made
a
mistake
and
the
few
tumbles
she
and
i
ever
had
together
took
place
only
when
she
found
herself
obliged
to
go
my
way
instead
of
her
own
we
entered
the
gorges
of
the
high
mountains
between
us
and
the
west
and
soon
lost
the
sun
even
the
brief
winter
twilight
faded
away
more
swiftly
than
usual
amid
those
dark
defiles
and
it
was
pitch
dark
though
only
five
when
we
heard
a
sudden
and
welcome
clamour
of
dog
voices
these
tones
invariably
constitute
the
first
notes
of
a
welcome
and
a
delightful
sound
it
is
to
the
belated
and
bewildered
traveller
for
besides
guiding
his
horse
to
the
right
spot
the
noise
serves
to
bring
out
some
one
to
see
who
the
traveller
may
be
on
this
occasion
we
heard
one
man
say
to
the
other
it
the
boss
so
almost
before
we
had
time
to
dismount
from
our
tired
horses
remember
they
had
each
carried
a
heavy
swag
besides
their
riders
lights
gleamed
from
the
windows
of
the
little
house
and
a
wood
fire
sparkled
and
sputtered
on
the
open
hearth
h
only
just
guided
me
to
the
door
of
the
making
an
apology
and
injunction
together
its
very
rough
i
am
afraid
but
you
can
do
what
you
like
before
he
hastened
back
to
assist
his
guests
in
settling
their
horses
comfortably
for
the
night
labour
used
to
be
so
dear
and
wages
so
high
especially
in
the
back
country
of
new
zealand
that
the
couple
of
men
one
for
indoor
work
to
saw
wood
milk
cook
sweep
and
the
other
to
act
as
gardener
groom
ploughman
and
do
all
the
numerous
odd
jobs
about
a
place
a
hundred
miles
and
more
from
the
nearest
shop
represented
a
of
at
least
pounds
a
year
every
gentleman
therefore
as
a
matter
of
course
sees
to
his
own
horse
when
he
arrives
unexpectedly
at
a
station
and
i
knew
i
should
have
at
least
half
an
hour
to
myself
the
first
thing
to
do
was
to
let
down
my
crinoline
for
i
could
only
walk
like
a
crab
in
it
when
it
was
fastened
up
for
riding
kilt
up
my
linsey
gown
take
off
my
hat
and
jacket
and
set
to
work
the
curtains
must
be
drawn
close
and
the
chairs
moved
out
from
their
symmetrical
positions
against
the
wall
then
i
made
an
expedition
into
the
kitchen
and
won
the
heart
of
the
stalwart
cook
who
was
already
frying
chops
over
the
fire
by
saying
in
my
best
german
i
have
come
to
help
you
with
the
tea
poor
man
it
was
very
unfair
for
h
had
told
me
during
our
ride
that
his
servitor
was
a
german
and
i
had
employed
the
last
long
hour
of
the
journey
in
rubbing
up
my
exceedingly
rusty
knowledge
of
that
language
and
arranging
one
or
two
effective
sentences
poor
karl
surprise
and
delight
knew
no
bounds
and
he
burst
forth
into
a
long
monologue
to
which
i
could
find
no
readier
answers
than
smiles
and
nods
hiding
my
inability
to
follow
up
my
brilliant
beginning
under
the
pretence
of
being
very
busy
by
the
time
the
gentlemen
had
stabled
and
fed
the
horses
and
were
ready
karl
and
i
between
us
had
arranged
a
bright
cosy
little
apartment
with
a
capital
on
the
table
after
this
meal
there
were
pipes
and
toddy
and
as
i
could
not
retire
like
micawber
at
david
copperfield
supper
party
into
the
adjoining
bedroom
and
sit
by
myself
in
the
cold
i
made
the
best
of
the
somewhat
dense
clouds
of
smoke
with
which
i
was
soon
surrounded
and
listened
to
the
fragmentary
plans
for
the
next
day
then
we
all
separated
for
the
night
and
in
two
minutes
i
was
fast
asleep
in
a
little
room
no
bigger
than
the
cabin
of
a
ship
with
an
opossum
rug
on
a
sofa
for
my
bed
and
bedding
it
was
cold
enough
the
next
morning
i
assure
you
so
cold
that
it
was
difficult
to
believe
the
statement
that
all
the
gentlemen
had
been
down
at
daybreak
to
bathe
in
the
great
lake
which
spread
like
an
inland
sea
before
the
of
the
little
sitting
room
this
lake
the
largest
of
the
mountain
chain
never
freezes
on
account
partly
of
its
great
depth
and
also
because
of
its
sunny
aspect
our
destination
lay
far
inland
and
if
we
meant
to
have
a
good
long
day
skating
we
must
start
at
once
such
a
perfect
day
as
it
was
i
felt
half
inclined
to
beg
off
the
first
day
on
the
ice
and
to
spend
my
morning
wandering
along
the
shores
of
lake
coleridge
with
its
glorious
enclosing
of
hills
which
might
fairly
be
called
mountains
but
i
feared
to
seem
capricious
or
lazy
when
really
my
only
difficulty
was
in
selecting
a
pleasure
the
sun
had
climbed
well
over
the
high
barriers
which
lay
eastwards
and
was
shining
brightly
down
through
the
quivering
blue
ether
overhead
the
frost
sparkled
on
every
broad
or
slender
as
if
the
silver
side
of
earth
were
turned
outwards
that
winter
morning
no
sooner
had
we
mounted
with
no
swag
except
our
skates
this
time
than
h
set
spurs
to
his
horse
and
bounded
over
the
of
the
paddock
before
karl
could
get
it
down
we
were
too
primitive
for
gates
in
those
parts
they
only
belonged
to
the
civilization
nearer
christchurch
and
i
had
much
ado
to
prevent
my
pony
from
following
his
lead
especially
as
the
other
gentlemen
were
only
too
delighted
to
get
rid
of
some
of
their
high
spirits
by
a
jump
however
karl
got
the
top
rail
down
for
me
and
mouse
hopped
over
the
lower
one
gaily
overtaking
the
leader
of
the
expedition
in
a
very
few
strides
we
could
not
keep
up
our
rapid
pace
long
for
the
ground
became
terribly
broken
and
cut
up
by
swamps
quicksands
blind
creeks
and
all
sorts
of
snares
and
every
moment
added
to
the
desolate
grandeur
of
the
scene
bleak
hills
rose
up
on
either
hand
with
still
bleaker
and
higher
peaks
appearing
beyond
them
again
an
awful
silence
unbroken
by
the
familiar
cheerful
sound
of
the
sheep
calling
to
each
other
for
even
the
hardy
merino
can
not
live
in
these
ranges
during
the
winter
months
brooded
around
us
and
the
dark
mass
of
a
splendid
bush
extending
over
many
hundred
acres
only
added
to
the
lonely
grandeur
of
the
scene
we
rode
almost
the
whole
time
in
a
deep
cold
shade
for
between
us
and
the
warm
were
such
lofty
mountains
that
it
was
only
for
a
few
brief
noontide
moments
he
could
peep
over
their
steep
sides
after
two
hour
riding
at
the
best
pace
which
we
could
keep
up
through
these
terrible
gorges
a
sharp
turn
of
the
track
brought
us
full
in
view
of
our
destination
i
can
never
forget
that
first
glimpse
of
lake
ida
in
the
cleft
of
a
huge
gaunt
bare
hill
divided
as
if
by
a
giant
hand
lay
a
large
sheet
of
ice
no
ray
of
sunshine
ever
struck
it
from
autumn
until
spring
and
it
seemed
impossible
to
imagine
our
venturing
to
skate
merrily
in
such
a
sombre
looking
spot
but
sheep
farmers
are
not
sentimental
i
am
afraid
beyond
a
rapid
thought
of
that
such
cold
country
was
not
on
run
they
did
not
feel
affected
by
its
eternal
silence
and
gloom
the
ice
would
bear
and
what
more
could
skater
heart
desire
at
the
end
of
the
dark
tarn
nearest
to
the
track
by
which
we
had
approached
it
stood
a
neat
little
hut
and
judge
of
my
amazement
when
as
we
rode
up
to
it
a
young
gentleman
looking
as
if
he
was
just
going
out
for
a
opened
the
low
door
and
came
out
to
greet
us
yes
here
was
one
of
those
strange
anomalies
peculiar
to
the
colonies
a
young
man
fresh
from
his
university
of
refined
tastes
and
cultivated
intellect
was
leading
here
the
life
of
a
boor
without
companionship
or
appreciation
of
any
sort
his
mate
seemed
to
be
a
rough
west
countryman
honest
and
well
meaning
enough
but
utterly
unsuited
to
k
it
was
the
old
story
of
wild
unpractical
ideas
hastily
carried
out
k
had
arrived
in
new
zealand
a
couple
of
years
before
with
all
his
worldly
wealth
pounds
finding
this
would
not
go
very
far
in
the
purchase
of
a
good
and
hearing
some
calculations
about
the
profit
to
be
derived
from
breeding
cattle
based
upon
somebody
lucky
speculation
he
eagerly
caught
at
one
of
the
many
offers
showered
upon
unfortunate
new
chums
and
bought
the
worst
and
bleakest
bit
of
one
of
the
worst
and
bleakest
runs
in
the
province
the
remainder
of
his
money
was
laid
out
in
purchasing
stock
and
now
he
had
sat
down
patiently
to
await
in
his
little
hut
until
such
time
as
his
brilliant
expectations
would
be
realized
i
may
say
here
they
became
fainter
and
fainter
year
by
year
and
at
last
faded
away
altogether
leaving
him
at
the
end
of
three
lonely
dreadful
years
with
exactly
half
his
capital
but
double
his
experience
however
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
my
story
except
that
i
can
never
think
of
our
skating
expedition
to
that
lonely
lake
far
back
among
those
terrible
hills
without
a
thrill
of
compassion
for
the
only
living
human
being
who
dwelt
among
them
it
was
too
cold
to
dawdle
about
however
that
day
the
frost
lay
white
and
hard
upon
the
ground
and
we
felt
that
we
were
cruel
in
leaving
our
poor
horses
standing
to
get
chilled
whilst
we
amused
ourselves
although
my
beloved
helen
was
not
there
having
been
exchanged
for
the
day
in
favour
of
master
mouse
a
shaggy
pony
whose
paces
were
as
rough
as
its
coat
i
begged
a
red
blanket
from
k
and
covered
up
stable
companion
whose
sleek
skin
spoke
of
a
milder
temperature
than
that
on
lake
ida
gloomy
shore
our
simple
arrangements
were
soon
made
k
left
directions
to
his
mate
to
prepare
a
repast
consisting
of
tea
bread
and
mutton
for
us
and
each
carrying
our
skates
we
made
the
best
of
our
way
across
the
frozen
tussocks
to
the
lake
k
proved
an
admirable
guide
over
its
surface
for
he
was
in
the
habit
during
the
winter
of
getting
all
his
firewood
out
of
the
opposite
bush
and
bringing
it
across
the
lake
on
sledges
drawn
by
bullocks
we
accused
him
of
having
cut
up
our
ice
dreadfully
by
these
means
but
he
took
us
to
a
part
of
the
vast
expanse
where
an
unbroken
field
of
at
least
ten
acres
of
ice
stretched
smoothly
before
us
here
were
no
boards
marked
dangerous
nor
any
intimation
of
the
depth
of
water
beneath
the
most
timid
person
could
feel
no
apprehension
on
ice
which
seemed
more
solid
than
the
earth
so
accordingly
in
a
few
moments
we
had
buckled
and
strapped
on
our
skates
and
were
skimming
and
gliding
and
i
must
add
falling
in
all
directions
we
were
very
much
out
of
practice
at
first
except
k
who
skated
every
day
taking
short
cuts
across
the
lake
to
track
a
stray
heifer
or
explore
a
blind
gully
i
despair
of
making
my
readers
see
the
scene
as
i
saw
it
or
of
conveying
any
adequate
idea
of
the
intense
the
appalling
loneliness
of
the
spot
it
really
seemed
to
me
as
if
our
voices
and
laughter
so
far
from
breaking
the
deep
eternal
silence
only
brought
it
out
into
stronger
relief
on
either
hand
rose
up
shear
from
the
waters
edge
a
great
barren
shingly
mountain
before
us
loomed
a
dark
pine
forest
whose
black
shadows
crept
up
until
they
merged
in
the
deep
and
fissures
of
the
snowy
range
behind
us
stretched
the
winding
gullies
by
which
we
had
climbed
to
this
mountain
tarn
and
k
little
hut
and
scrap
of
a
garden
and
paddock
gave
the
one
touch
of
life
or
possibility
of
life
to
this
desolate
region
in
spite
of
all
scenic
wet
blankets
we
tried
hard
to
be
gay
and
no
one
but
myself
would
acknowledge
that
we
found
the
lonely
grandeur
of
our
rink
too
much
for
us
we
skated
away
perseveringly
until
we
were
both
tired
and
hungry
when
we
returned
to
k
hut
took
a
hasty
meal
and
mounted
our
chilled
steeds
h
insisted
on
bringing
poor
k
back
with
us
though
he
was
somewhat
reluctant
to
come
alleging
that
a
few
days
spent
in
the
society
of
his
kind
made
the
solitude
of
his
hut
all
the
more
dreary
the
next
day
and
yet
the
next
we
returned
to
our
gloomy
skating
ground
and
when
i
turned
round
in
my
saddle
as
we
rode
away
on
friday
evening
for
a
last
look
at
lake
ida
lying
behind
us
in
her
winter
black
numbness
her
aspect
seemed
more
forbidding
than
ever
for
only
the
bare
steep
could
be
seen
the
pine
forest
and
white
distant
mountains
were
all
blotted
and
blurred
out
of
sight
by
a
heavy
pall
of
cloud
creeping
slowly
up
let
us
ride
fast
cried
k
or
we
shall
have
a
upon
us
so
we
galloped
home
as
quickly
as
we
could
over
ground
that
i
do
really
believe
i
could
summon
courage
to
walk
across
ever
so
slowly
but
then
one
nerves
and
courage
are
in
very
different
order
out
in
new
zealand
to
the
low
standard
which
rules
for
ladies
in
england
who
live
at
home
in
ease
long
before
we
reached
home
the
storm
was
pelting
us
my
little
jacket
was
like
a
white
board
when
i
took
it
off
for
the
sleet
and
snow
had
frozen
as
it
fell
i
was
wet
to
the
skin
and
so
numb
with
cold
i
could
hardly
stand
when
we
reached
home
at
last
in
the
dark
and
i
could
only
get
my
things
very
imperfectly
dried
and
had
to
manage
as
best
i
could
but
yet
no
one
even
thought
of
making
the
inquiry
next
morning
when
i
came
out
to
breakfast
have
you
caught
cold
it
would
have
seemed
a
ridiculous
question
chapter
v
i
can
not
resist
the
temptation
to
touch
upon
one
of
the
winter
amusements
which
came
to
us
two
years
later
yet
the
word
amusement
seems
out
of
place
no
one
in
the
province
having
much
heart
to
amuse
themselves
for
the
great
snow
storm
of
august
had
just
taken
place
and
we
were
in
the
first
days
of
bewilderment
at
the
calamity
which
had
befallen
us
all
a
week
incessant
accompanied
by
a
fierce
and
freezing
wind
had
not
only
covered
the
whole
of
the
mountains
from
base
to
brow
with
shining
white
through
which
not
a
single
dark
rock
jutted
but
had
drifted
on
the
plains
for
many
feet
deep
gullies
had
been
filled
up
by
the
soft
driving
flakes
creeks
were
bridged
over
and
for
three
weeks
and
more
all
communication
between
the
stations
and
the
various
townships
was
cut
off
the
full
extent
of
our
losses
was
unknown
to
us
and
dreary
as
were
our
forebodings
of
misfortune
none
of
us
guessed
that
snow
to
be
the
winding
sheet
of
half
a
million
of
sheep
the
magnificent
of
the
southern
alps
stood
out
for
a
hundred
miles
from
north
to
south
in
appalling
white
distinctness
and
no
one
in
the
whole
colony
had
ever
seen
the
splendid
range
thus
free
from
fleck
or
flaw
we
had
done
all
we
could
within
working
distance
but
what
was
the
use
of
digging
in
drifts
thirty
feet
deep
amidst
and
almost
above
the
terrible
anxiety
about
our
own
individual
safety
for
the
snow
was
over
the
roof
of
many
of
the
came
the
pressing
question
where
are
the
sheep
a
profound
silence
unbroken
by
bleat
of
lamb
or
bark
of
dog
or
any
sound
of
life
had
reigned
for
many
days
when
a
merciful
gale
sprung
up
and
releasing
the
earth
from
its
white
bondage
freed
the
miserable
remnant
of
our
flocks
and
herds
at
least
i
should
say
it
freed
those
sheep
which
had
travelled
down
to
the
vallies
driven
before
the
first
pitiless
gusts
but
we
knew
that
many
hundreds
if
not
thousands
of
wethers
must
have
been
surprised
and
imprisoned
far
back
among
the
hills
such
knowledge
could
not
be
acted
upon
however
for
no
human
being
could
hope
to
plunge
through
the
drifts
around
us
old
shepherds
who
had
lived
on
the
run
for
fifteen
years
confessed
that
they
did
not
know
their
way
fifty
yards
from
the
homestead
the
vallies
were
filled
up
so
that
one
gully
looked
precisely
like
its
fellow
rocks
scrub
palms
all
our
local
had
disappeared
not
a
fence
or
gate
could
be
seen
in
all
the
country
side
here
and
there
a
long
line
in
the
smooth
mass
would
lead
us
to
suppose
that
a
wire
fence
lay
buried
beneath
its
curves
but
we
had
no
means
of
knowing
for
certain
near
the
house
every
shrub
and
every
or
had
all
been
covered
up
and
no
man
might
even
guess
where
they
lay
this
had
been
the
terrible
state
of
things
and
although
the
blessed
warm
wind
had
removed
our
immediate
and
pressing
fear
of
starvation
we
could
not
hope
to
employ
ourselves
in
searching
for
our
missing
sheep
for
many
days
to
come
none
of
us
had
been
able
to
take
any
exercise
for
more
than
a
fortnight
and
having
done
all
that
could
possibly
be
done
near
at
hand
f
set
to
work
to
manufacture
some
sledges
out
of
old
quite
close
to
the
house
a
hill
sloped
smoothly
for
about
yards
at
an
angle
of
degrees
along
its
side
lay
a
perfectly
level
and
deep
drift
which
did
not
show
any
signs
of
thawing
for
more
than
a
month
and
we
resolved
to
use
this
as
a
natural
the
construction
of
a
suitable
sledge
was
the
first
difficulty
to
be
surmounted
and
many
were
the
dismal
failures
and
catastrophes
which
preceded
what
we
considered
a
safe
and
successful
vehicle
not
only
was
it
immensely
difficult
to
make
without
either
proper
materials
or
tools
a
sledge
which
could
hold
two
people
for
f
declared
it
was
no
fun
sleighing
alone
but
his
patent
brakes
proved
the
most
broken
of
reeds
to
lean
upon
when
the
sledge
was
dashing
down
the
steep
incline
at
the
rate
of
a
thousand
miles
an
hour
we
nearly
broke
our
necks
more
than
once
and
i
look
back
now
with
amazement
to
our
how
well
i
remember
one
expedition
when
f
who
had
been
hammering
away
in
a
shed
all
the
morning
came
to
find
me
sitting
in
the
sun
in
the
verandah
and
to
inform
me
that
at
last
he
had
perfected
a
conveyance
which
would
combine
speed
with
safety
undaunted
by
previous
mishaps
i
sallied
forth
and
in
company
with
u
and
f
climbed
painfully
up
the
high
hill
i
have
mentioned
by
some
steps
which
they
had
cut
in
the
frozen
snow
without
some
such
help
we
could
not
have
kept
our
footing
for
a
moment
and
as
long
as
i
live
i
shall
never
forget
the
sensation
of
leaving
my
friendly
alpenstock
planted
in
the
snow
and
of
seating
myself
on
that
frail
sledge
perhaps
i
ought
to
describe
it
here
a
board
about
six
feet
long
by
one
foot
broad
with
nailed
beneath
it
and
curved
upwards
in
front
on
its
upper
surface
a
couple
of
battens
were
fixed
one
quite
at
the
foremost
end
and
one
that
was
f
new
patent
sledge
warranted
to
go
faster
down
an
incline
than
any
other
conveyance
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
i
was
the
wretched
passenger
as
he
called
me
on
more
than
one
occasion
and
i
will
briefly
describe
my
experiences
why
did
you
go
is
a
very
natural
question
to
arise
in
my
reader
mind
and
sitting
here
at
my
i
feel
as
if
i
must
have
been
a
lunatic
to
venture
but
in
those
delicious
wild
days
no
enterprise
seemed
too
rash
or
dangerous
to
engage
in
from
mounting
a
horse
which
had
never
seen
or
felt
the
fluttering
of
a
habit
to
embarking
on
the
conveyance
i
have
described
above
and
starting
down
a
at
the
risk
of
a
broken
neck
well
to
return
to
that
terrible
moment
i
see
the
whole
scene
now
the
frail
rude
sledge
with
its
breaks
made
out
of
a
couple
of
standards
from
a
wire
fence
connected
by
a
strong
iron
chain
f
seated
at
the
back
of
the
precious
contrivance
firmly
grasping
a
standard
in
each
hand
u
clinging
desperately
to
his
with
one
hand
whilst
with
the
other
he
helps
me
on
to
the
board
and
nettle
my
dear
little
terrier
standing
shivering
on
three
legs
sniffing
distrustfully
at
the
sledge
it
is
extremely
difficult
even
to
take
one
place
on
a
board
a
dozen
inches
wide
my
petticoats
have
to
be
firmly
wrapped
around
me
and
care
taken
that
no
fold
projects
beyond
the
sledge
or
i
should
be
soon
dragged
out
of
my
frail
seat
i
fix
my
feet
firmly
against
the
batten
and
f
cries
are
you
ready
oh
not
yet
i
gasp
clinging
to
u
hand
as
if
i
never
meant
to
let
it
go
hold
tight
he
shouts
now
what
a
mockery
this
injunction
was
i
had
nothing
to
hold
on
to
except
my
own
knees
and
i
clasped
them
convulsively
u
says
you
all
right
now
and
before
i
can
realize
that
he
has
let
go
my
hand
before
my
courage
is
up
to
the
necessary
height
we
are
off
the
breaks
are
slightly
depressed
for
the
first
few
yards
in
order
to
regulate
our
pace
and
because
there
is
a
tremendously
steep
pitch
just
at
first
once
we
have
safely
passed
that
he
tilts
up
the
standards
and
our
sledge
shoots
like
a
meteor
down
the
perfectly
smooth
incline
i
can
not
draw
my
breath
we
are
going
at
such
a
pace
through
the
keen
air
i
give
myself
up
for
lost
we
come
to
another
steep
pitch
near
the
bottom
of
the
hill
f
is
laughing
to
such
a
degree
at
me
that
he
does
not
put
down
his
breaks
soon
enough
and
loses
control
of
the
sledge
we
appear
to
leap
down
the
dip
and
then
the
sledge
turns
first
one
way
and
then
the
other
its
zinc
prow
being
sometimes
and
down
it
seems
wonderful
that
we
keep
on
the
sledge
for
we
have
no
means
of
holding
on
except
by
pressing
our
feet
against
the
battens
yet
in
the
grand
and
final
upset
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
the
sledge
is
there
too
and
we
find
we
have
never
parted
company
from
it
will
any
one
believe
that
after
such
a
perilous
journey
i
could
actually
be
persuaded
to
try
again
but
so
it
was
at
first
the
fright
for
i
was
really
terrified
used
to
make
me
very
cross
and
i
declared
that
i
was
severely
hurt
if
not
kilt
entirely
but
after
i
had
shaken
the
snow
out
of
my
linsey
skirt
and
discovered
that
beyond
the
damage
to
my
nerves
i
was
uninjured
f
was
quite
sure
to
try
to
persuade
me
to
make
another
attempt
and
i
was
equally
sure
to
yield
to
the
temptation
as
well
as
my
memory
serves
me
we
only
made
one
really
successful
journey
and
that
was
on
an
occasion
when
we
kept
the
breaks
down
the
whole
way
but
i
never
could
insure
similar
precautions
being
taken
again
and
we
consequently
experienced
every
variety
of
mishaps
possible
to
sledge
travellers
i
persevered
however
for
some
days
until
the
wind
which
was
blowing
softly
all
the
time
began
to
lay
bare
the
sharpest
points
of
the
rocks
and
then
i
gave
in
at
once
and
would
not
be
a
passenger
any
more
it
was
rather
too
much
to
strike
one
head
against
a
jagged
fragment
of
rock
or
to
dislocate
one
thumb
against
a
concealed
stump
of
a
palm
tree
then
the
sharp
points
of
the
spaniards
began
to
stick
up
through
the
softening
snow
and
nothing
would
induce
me
to
run
the
risk
of
touching
their
green
bayonets
besides
which
the
snow
made
it
very
difficult
to
climb
up
to
the
top
of
our
hill
for
the
steps
had
disappeared
long
ago
so
i
gave
up
sledge
journeys
on
my
own
account
and
used
only
to
look
at
f
and
u
taking
them
these
two
persevered
so
long
as
an
inch
of
snow
remained
on
the
some
of
their
adventures
were
very
alarming
and
certainly
rather
dangerous
one
afternoon
i
had
been
watching
them
for
more
than
an
hour
and
had
seen
them
go
through
every
variety
of
disaster
and
capsize
with
no
further
effect
than
increasing
their
desire
for
one
more
trial
on
the
of
the
hill
that
is
to
say
the
side
which
gets
scarcely
any
sun
in
winter
a
deep
drift
of
snow
still
lingered
filling
up
a
furrow
made
in
former
years
by
a
thither
the
two
adventurous
climbers
dragged
their
sledge
and
down
the
steep
incline
they
performed
their
perilous
descent
many
a
time
i
became
tired
of
watching
the
board
shoot
swiftly
over
the
white
streak
and
i
strolled
round
the
shoulder
of
the
hill
to
see
if
there
was
any
appearance
of
the
lessening
in
the
back
country
i
must
have
been
away
about
half
an
hour
and
had
made
the
circuit
of
the
little
knoll
which
projected
from
the
mountain
side
returning
to
where
i
expected
to
find
sleigh
and
sleighers
starting
perhaps
on
just
one
more
journey
but
no
one
was
there
and
a
dozen
yards
or
so
from
the
usual
the
snow
was
a
good
deal
ploughed
up
and
stained
in
large
patches
by
blood
here
was
an
alarming
spectacle
though
the
only
wonder
was
that
a
bad
accident
had
not
occurred
before
i
saw
the
sledge
deserted
and
broken
near
the
end
of
the
drift
of
the
passengers
there
was
neither
sign
nor
token
i
must
say
i
was
terribly
frightened
but
it
is
useless
in
new
zealand
to
scream
or
faint
the
only
thing
to
do
in
an
emergency
is
to
and
so
although
my
heart
was
thumping
loudly
in
my
ears
and
at
first
i
could
not
produce
a
sound
i
managed
at
last
after
many
attempts
to
muster
up
a
loud
clear
there
was
the
usual
pause
whilst
the
last
sharp
note
rang
back
from
the
and
vibrated
through
the
clear
silent
air
and
then
oh
welcome
sound
i
heard
a
vigorous
answer
from
our
own
flat
where
the
homestead
stood
i
set
off
as
fast
as
i
could
and
had
the
joy
when
i
turned
the
slope
which
had
hidden
our
little
house
from
my
view
to
see
f
and
u
walking
about
but
even
from
that
distance
i
could
see
that
poor
u
head
was
bandaged
up
and
as
soon
as
i
got
near
enough
to
hear
f
shouted
i
have
broken
my
neck
adding
i
am
very
hungry
let
us
go
in
to
supper
under
the
circumstances
these
words
were
consolatory
and
when
i
came
to
hear
the
story
this
was
the
way
the
accident
happened
as
i
mentioned
before
even
this
drift
had
thawed
till
it
was
soft
at
the
surface
and
worn
away
almost
to
the
rocks
during
a
rapid
descent
the
nose
of
the
sledge
dipped
through
the
snow
and
stopped
dead
against
a
rock
u
was
instantly
buried
in
the
snow
falling
into
a
young
but
prickly
spaniard
which
assaulted
him
grievously
but
f
shot
over
his
head
some
ten
yards
turned
a
somersault
and
alit
on
his
feet
this
sounds
a
harmless
performance
enough
but
it
requires
practice
and
f
declared
that
for
weeks
afterwards
his
neck
felt
twisted
the
accident
must
have
looked
very
ridiculous
the
sledge
one
moment
gliding
smoothly
along
at
the
rate
of
forty
miles
an
hour
the
next
a
dead
stop
and
f
flying
through
the
air
over
his
passenger
head
finishing
feet
first
plump
down
in
the
soft
snow
looking
back
on
that
time
i
can
remember
how
curiously
soon
the
external
traces
of
the
great
disappeared
for
some
weeks
after
the
friendly
the
air
of
the
whole
neighbourhood
was
tainted
by
dead
and
decaying
sheep
and
lambs
and
the
wire
fences
rails
and
every
coign
of
vantage
had
to
be
made
useful
but
ghastly
by
a
tapestry
of
the
only
wonder
was
that
a
single
sheep
had
survived
a
storm
severe
enough
to
kill
wild
pigs
great
boars
cased
in
hides
an
inch
thick
had
perished
through
sheer
stress
of
weather
while
animals
with
only
a
few
months
growth
of
fine
merino
wool
on
their
backs
had
endured
it
all
it
was
well
known
that
the
actual
destruction
of
sheep
was
mainly
owing
to
the
two
days
of
heavy
rain
which
succeeded
the
snow
out
of
a
flock
of
of
all
ages
we
lost
on
the
lowest
calculation
grown
sheep
and
nearly
lambs
and
yet
our
loss
was
small
by
comparison
with
that
of
our
neighbours
whose
runs
were
further
back
among
the
hill
and
less
sheltered
than
our
own
long
before
midsummer
our
hills
were
green
once
more
and
i
think
i
see
again
their
beautiful
outlines
their
steep
sides
planted
with
palms
and
grasses
whilst
the
more
distant
peaks
are
veiled
in
a
sultry
haze
during
that
peculiarly
bright
and
lovely
summer
we
often
ask
each
other
could
it
have
been
true
that
no
one
knew
one
mountain
from
the
other
and
that
hills
had
been
apparently
levelled
and
vallies
filled
up
by
the
heaviest
ever
known
but
whilst
the
words
were
on
our
lips
we
could
see
a
group
of
ten
feet
high
with
their
topmost
leaves
gnawed
to
the
stump
by
starving
sheep
that
must
have
been
standing
on
at
least
seven
feet
of
snow
to
reach
them
and
there
was
scarcely
a
creek
on
the
run
whose
banks
were
not
strewn
for
many
a
long
day
by
bare
and
bleaching
bones
chapter
vi
buying
a
run
like
many
other
people
in
the
world
i
have
occasionally
built
castles
in
the
air
and
equally
of
course
they
have
invariably
tumbled
down
in
due
time
with
a
crash
this
particular
castle
however
not
only
attained
to
a
great
elevation
in
the
visionary
builder
eyes
but
it
covered
so
vast
an
area
of
land
that
the
story
of
its
rise
and
fall
deserves
to
be
placed
on
record
as
a
warning
to
aerial
architects
and
also
as
a
to
young
colonists
this
was
exactly
the
way
it
all
happened
the
new
year
of
us
living
very
quietly
and
happily
on
a
small
compact
at
the
foot
of
the
malvern
hills
in
the
province
of
canterbury
new
zealand
as
runs
went
its
dimensions
were
small
indeed
for
we
only
measured
it
at
acres
all
told
the
great
tidal
wave
of
prosperity
which
sets
once
in
a
while
towards
the
shores
of
all
colonies
had
that
year
swelled
and
risen
to
its
full
force
but
this
we
did
not
know
borne
aloft
upon
its
unsubstantial
crest
we
could
not
from
that
giddy
height
discern
any
of
adversity
or
clouds
of
change
and
storm
along
the
shining
horizon
of
the
new
world
around
us
all
our
calculations
were
based
on
the
assumption
that
the
existing
prices
for
sheep
wool
cattle
and
all
would
rule
for
many
a
long
day
and
the
delightful
part
of
this
royal
road
to
wealth
was
that
its
travellers
need
not
exert
themselves
in
any
way
they
had
only
to
sit
still
with
folded
hands
whilst
their
sheep
increased
and
it
was
well
known
that
a
flock
doubled
itself
in
three
short
years
the
obvious
deduction
from
this
agreeable
numerical
fact
was
that
in
an
equally
short
period
your
agent
payments
to
your
bank
account
would
also
be
doubled
in
the
meantime
the
drays
were
busy
carting
the
wool
to
the
seaports
as
fast
as
they
could
be
loaded
whilst
speculative
drovers
rode
all
about
the
country
buying
up
the
fat
cattle
and
wethers
from
every
run
these
were
wanted
to
supply
the
west
coast
diggings
which
had
just
broken
out
as
the
curious
phrase
goes
there
and
so
was
every
description
of
grain
and
dairy
produce
we
squatters
were
not
the
only
inhabitants
of
this
fool
paradise
the
local
government
began
planning
extensive
works
railways
were
laid
out
in
every
direction
bridges
planned
across
rivers
which
proved
the
despair
of
engineers
whilst
a
tunnel
the
wonder
of
the
southern
hemisphere
was
commenced
through
a
range
of
hills
lying
between
port
lyttleton
and
christchurch
all
this
work
was
undertaken
on
a
scale
of
pay
which
made
the
poor
immigrants
who
thronged
to
the
place
by
every
ship
rub
their
eyes
and
believe
they
must
be
dreaming
and
that
they
would
presently
wake
up
and
find
themselves
back
again
in
the
old
country
at
the
old
starvation
rate
of
wages
small
capitalists
with
perhaps
only
one
or
two
hundred
pounds
in
the
world
bid
against
each
other
as
purchasers
of
sections
in
the
townships
or
of
lots
of
arable
land
in
the
projected
suburbs
subscriptions
were
raised
for
building
a
cathedral
in
christchurch
but
so
dear
was
both
labour
and
material
that
pounds
barely
sufficed
to
lay
its
foundations
the
paramount
anxiety
in
men
minds
seemed
to
be
to
secure
land
in
sheltered
accessible
parts
of
the
country
commanded
enormous
prices
and
were
bought
in
the
most
complicated
way
the
first
comers
had
taken
up
vast
tracts
of
land
in
all
directions
from
the
government
at
an
almost
nominal
rental
this
had
happened
quite
in
the
dark
and
remote
ages
of
the
history
of
the
colony
at
least
ten
or
twelve
years
before
the
date
of
which
i
write
as
speculators
with
plenty
of
hard
cash
came
down
from
australia
these
original
tenants
sold
as
it
were
the
and
stock
of
their
run
at
enormous
prices
but
what
always
seemed
to
me
so
hard
was
that
after
you
had
paid
any
number
of
thousand
pounds
for
your
run
you
might
have
to
buy
it
all
or
at
any
rate
some
portion
of
it
over
again
land
could
only
be
purchased
freehold
from
the
government
for
pounds
an
acre
and
if
a
cockatoo
a
small
farmer
or
a
speculator
in
mines
fancied
any
part
of
your
property
he
had
only
to
go
to
the
land
office
and
challenge
your
rights
the
officials
gave
you
notice
of
the
challenge
and
six
weeks
grace
in
which
to
raise
the
money
and
buy
it
freehold
yourself
but
few
could
afford
to
pay
a
good
many
hundred
pounds
unexpectedly
to
secure
even
their
best
flats
or
vallies
hence
it
often
happened
that
large
runs
in
the
most
favourable
situations
were
cut
up
by
small
investors
free
selectors
as
they
are
called
in
australia
and
it
used
to
be
rather
absurd
the
way
one
grew
to
distrust
any
stranger
who
was
descried
riding
about
the
run
the
poor
man
might
be
looking
for
a
stray
horse
or
have
lost
his
way
but
we
always
fancied
he
must
be
prospecting
for
either
gold
or
coals
or
else
be
a
cockatoo
disguised
as
a
traveller
such
was
the
state
of
things
when
my
story
opens
shearing
was
just
over
and
we
knew
to
a
lamb
how
rapidly
our
flocks
and
herds
were
increasing
a
succession
of
mild
winters
and
early
genial
springs
had
got
the
flock
into
capital
order
the
wool
had
all
been
sent
off
to
christchurch
by
drays
the
sheep
were
turned
out
on
the
beautiful
green
hills
for
ten
months
of
perfect
rest
and
peace
whilst
the
dogs
who
had
barked
themselves
quite
hoarse
were
enabled
to
desist
from
their
labours
in
mustering
and
watching
the
yet
unshorn
mobs
on
the
vallies
although
our
run
was
as
well
grassed
and
watered
as
any
in
the
province
still
it
could
not
possibly
carry
more
than
a
certain
number
of
sheep
and
to
that
total
our
returns
showed
that
we
were
rapidly
approaching
the
most
careful
calculations
warned
us
that
by
next
shearing
we
should
hardly
know
what
to
do
with
our
sheep
it
is
always
better
to
be
under
than
overstocked
for
the
merino
gets
out
of
condition
immediately
and
even
the
staple
of
the
wool
deteriorates
if
its
wearer
be
at
all
crowded
on
his
you
must
take
up
more
country
directly
was
the
invariable
formula
of
the
advice
we
comparatively
new
chums
received
on
all
sides
this
was
easier
to
say
than
to
do
turn
which
ever
way
we
would
far
back
beyond
our
own
lovely
vallies
and
green
hills
back
up
to
the
bleak
region
of
glaciers
where
miles
of
bush
and
hundreds
of
acres
of
steep
formed
the
of
back
country
every
inch
of
land
was
taken
up
no
fear
had
those
distant
squatters
of
cockatoos
or
even
of
miners
for
no
one
came
their
way
who
could
possibly
help
it
still
we
should
have
been
comparatively
glad
to
buy
such
a
run
fifty
or
sixty
miles
further
back
at
the
foot
in
fact
of
the
great
southern
alps
just
as
a
summer
for
the
least
valuable
portion
of
our
flock
but
no
one
was
inclined
to
part
with
a
single
acre
and
we
were
forced
to
turn
our
eyes
in
a
totally
different
direction
if
my
readers
will
refer
to
the
accompanying
map
of
new
zealand
and
look
at
the
middle
or
south
island
they
will
notice
a
long
seaboard
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
island
stretching
for
many
hundred
leagues
it
extends
beyond
the
province
of
canterbury
to
that
of
otago
and
embraces
some
of
the
most
magnificent
pastoral
land
in
the
settlement
not
only
is
the
soil
rich
and
productive
but
the
climate
is
rather
less
windy
than
with
us
in
the
northern
portion
of
the
island
and
the
capital
of
otago
dunedin
had
risen
into
comparative
position
and
importance
before
christchurch
was
in
short
an
elder
sister
of
that
pretty
little
town
most
of
the
settlers
in
otago
were
scotchmen
and
as
there
are
no
better
colonists
anywhere
its
prosperity
had
attained
to
a
very
flourishing
height
had
also
broken
out
at
the
foot
of
the
dunstan
range
so
that
otago
held
her
head
quite
as
high
if
not
higher
than
her
neighbour
canterbury
of
course
all
the
down
south
as
it
was
called
had
been
taken
up
long
before
but
we
heard
rumours
of
splendid
sheep
country
yet
unappropriated
far
back
towards
the
west
coast
of
otago
just
where
its
boundary
joined
canterbury
with
our
minds
in
this
state
of
desire
for
what
poor
mazzini
used
to
denounce
as
territorial
aggrandisement
we
paid
our
usual
visit
to
christchurch
f
had
his
agent
accounts
to
examine
a
nice
little
surplus
of
to
receive
and
many
other
squatting
interests
to
attend
to
whilst
i
had
to
lay
in
chests
of
tea
barrels
of
sugar
and
rice
hundreds
of
yards
of
reels
of
cotton
and
many
other
miscellaneous
articles
but
through
all
our
pleasant
happy
little
bustle
ran
the
constant
thought
what
shall
we
do
for
more
country
a
day
or
two
before
the
expiration
of
the
week
leave
of
absence
which
we
always
gave
ourselves
f
came
into
my
at
the
hotel
flung
down
his
hat
on
the
table
with
an
air
of
triumph
and
cried
i
heard
of
such
a
splendid
run
one
hundred
thousand
acres
of
beautiful
and
going
for
a
mere
song
now
i
had
lived
long
enough
in
the
world
to
discover
that
one
sometimes
danced
on
the
wrong
foot
to
the
tune
of
these
mere
songs
so
i
cautiously
inquired
where
is
it
f
seemed
a
little
dashed
that
the
only
question
which
he
could
not
answer
favourably
should
be
the
first
i
asked
and
he
replied
vaguely
well
it
is
rather
a
long
way
off
but
i
am
sure
we
can
manage
it
a
little
more
sifting
elicited
the
fact
that
this
desirable
investment
stretched
along
the
shores
of
lake
wanaka
famous
for
its
beautiful
scenery
and
was
to
be
had
for
what
certainly
seemed
a
ridiculously
small
sum
only
a
few
hundred
pounds
of
course
it
has
no
sheep
on
it
added
f
but
that
is
all
the
better
i
burn
it
this
year
and
then
turn
some
cattle
on
it
and
after
next
shearing
we
have
a
good
mob
of
sheep
to
draft
out
and
stock
it
he
further
added
that
he
had
invited
his
man
of
business
and
the
individual
who
owned
this
magnificent
property
to
dine
with
us
that
evening
and
that
then
i
should
hear
all
about
it
and
i
may
truly
say
that
i
hear
about
it
for
my
brain
reeled
with
figures
and
calculations
by
bedtime
i
was
wondering
if
we
could
possibly
spend
the
enormous
fortune
which
would
be
quite
certain
to
accrue
to
us
in
a
few
years
if
only
we
could
make
up
our
minds
to
invest
the
modest
balance
at
our
bankers
in
this
tempting
bargain
i
remember
well
that
i
found
myself
wishing
we
were
not
going
to
be
so
rich
half
our
promised
income
would
have
been
ample
i
thought
my
anxieties
on
that
score
turned
out
to
have
been
to
say
the
least
premature
not
to
make
my
story
too
long
i
may
briefly
say
that
after
making
due
allowance
for
the
natural
exaggeration
of
the
owner
the
run
on
lake
wanaka
shores
seemed
certainly
to
offer
many
attractions
besides
thousands
of
acres
of
beautiful
sheltered
sheep
country
it
was
said
to
possess
a
magnificent
bush
in
which
sawyers
were
already
hard
at
work
of
course
all
this
timber
would
become
our
own
and
we
were
to
make
so
much
a
year
by
selling
it
how
about
the
carriage
inquired
f
cautiously
having
visions
of
costly
and
teams
and
drivers
at
fabulous
wages
oh
the
lake
is
your
highway
replied
the
seller
airily
you
have
nothing
to
do
but
lash
your
felled
trees
together
as
they
do
in
the
countries
and
set
them
afloat
on
the
lake
they
will
thus
form
a
natural
raft
and
cost
you
little
or
nothing
to
get
down
to
a
good
market
you
know
the
dunstan
diggings
are
just
at
the
foot
of
the
lake
and
they
have
a
stick
there
timber
is
very
badly
wanted
in
those
parts
not
only
for
fuel
and
building
but
also
for
slabbing
the
shafts
which
the
miners
sink
by
the
time
the
coffee
was
served
f
had
made
up
his
mind
to
buy
the
lake
wanaka
run
his
business
agent
urging
him
strongly
not
to
hesitate
for
a
moment
in
securing
such
a
chance
the
negotiations
reached
thus
far
without
the
least
hitch
but
at
this
point
f
said
well
tell
you
what
i
do
we
will
start
in
a
day
or
two
and
go
straight
up
to
this
run
and
look
round
it
and
if
i
find
it
anything
like
so
good
as
you
both
make
it
out
i
buy
it
on
the
spot
never
did
that
sociable
little
word
we
sound
so
delightful
to
my
ears
then
i
am
to
come
too
i
thought
to
myself
but
i
prudently
concealed
from
the
company
that
i
had
ever
had
any
misgivings
on
that
point
however
the
company
did
not
concern
themselves
with
my
doubts
and
fears
for
our
two
guests
seemed
much
taken
aback
at
this
very
proposal
of
f
that
wo
do
at
all
my
dear
fellow
said
the
owner
of
the
run
i
am
going
to
england
by
the
next
mail
steamer
which
you
know
sails
next
week
and
the
reason
i
am
literally
giving
away
my
property
is
that
i
do
want
any
suspense
or
bother
take
it
or
leave
it
just
as
you
like
there
wilkinson
and
fairwright
and
a
lot
of
others
all
clamouring
for
the
refusal
of
it
and
i
only
waited
to
see
if
you
really
wanted
it
before
closing
with
fairwright
he
is
walking
about
with
a
cheque
all
ready
filled
up
in
his
pocket
and
only
begging
and
praying
me
to
let
him
have
the
run
on
my
own
terms
why
you
might
be
or
kept
there
for
a
month
and
what
shall
i
do
then
no
its
all
just
as
i
told
you
and
you
can
call
it
your
own
but
i
ca
possibly
wait
for
you
to
go
and
look
at
it
no
words
of
mine
can
give
any
idea
of
the
tone
of
scorn
in
which
our
guest
pronounced
these
last
three
words
as
if
looking
at
an
intended
purchase
was
at
once
the
meanest
and
most
absurd
thing
world
f
seemed
half
ashamed
of
himself
for
his
proposal
but
still
he
urged
that
he
never
liked
to
take
a
leap
in
the
dark
backing
up
his
opinion
by
several
adages
that
all
very
fine
chimed
in
our
precious
business
adviser
but
this
transaction
can
hardly
be
said
to
be
in
the
dark
here
are
the
plans
and
the
government
lease
and
the
transfer
deeds
all
regular
and
ready
with
this
he
produced
the
plans
and
then
it
was
all
up
with
us
who
does
not
know
the
peculiar
of
with
its
suggestions
of
ownership
when
these
fresh
and
crackling
drawings
were
opened
before
us
they
resembled
nothing
so
much
as
a
veritable
paradise
there
shone
the
lake
a
brilliant
patch
of
cobalt
blue
bordered
by
outlines
of
vivid
green
pasture
and
belts
of
timber
here
and
there
on
the
outskirts
we
read
the
words
proposed
township
building
lots
probable
gold
fields
saw
mills
f
laid
his
hand
down
over
a
large
wash
of
light
green
paint
and
asked
now
what
sort
of
country
is
this
really
and
truly
you
know
first
class
sheep
country
i
give
you
my
word
replied
the
owner
eagerly
only
wants
to
be
stocked
for
a
year
or
two
why
need
i
go
on
it
was
the
old
old
story
of
misplaced
confidence
neither
f
nor
i
could
believe
that
our
friends
would
wilfully
us
so
it
was
settled
that
the
first
thing
next
morning
the
money
should
be
handed
over
and
the
government
lease
transferred
to
us
we
decided
that
as
we
were
so
far
on
the
way
to
our
new
property
we
would
go
and
look
at
it
before
returning
to
the
malvern
hills
and
the
next
few
days
were
very
busy
ones
as
we
had
to
arrange
our
small
domestic
affairs
send
up
the
dray
etc
i
felt
rather
anxious
at
the
postponement
of
our
return
home
for
i
had
left
several
clutches
of
eggs
on
the
point
of
being
hatched
and
i
had
grave
misgivings
as
to
the
care
my
expected
ducklings
and
chickens
would
receive
at
the
lands
of
my
maid
servants
to
say
nothing
of
the
dangers
besetting
them
from
hawks
and
rats
however
small
interests
must
give
way
to
great
ones
and
f
and
i
were
already
tasting
the
cares
of
proprietorship
our
friend
the
former
owner
of
our
new
property
sailed
for
england
in
the
mail
steamer
in
high
spirits
saying
cordially
as
he
shook
f
hand
at
parting
well
you
got
your
fortune
cut
out
for
you
and
no
mistake
i
feel
half
sorry
already
to
think
that
parted
with
that
run
about
two
days
after
his
departure
f
who
had
registered
his
name
at
the
land
office
as
the
present
tenant
of
acres
in
the
lake
wanaka
district
received
a
polite
request
from
official
quarters
to
pay
up
the
annual
rent
just
due
amounting
to
pounds
or
so
we
had
effected
our
brilliant
negotiations
about
a
week
too
soon
it
seemed
but
that
was
our
own
fault
so
we
had
nothing
to
do
but
pay
the
money
with
as
good
a
grace
as
possible
i
am
free
to
confess
that
this
second
cheque
ran
our
banker
account
very
fine
indeed
but
still
in
those
palmy
days
of
the
past
this
was
no
subject
of
uneasiness
to
a
squatter
his
credit
was
almost
unlimited
and
he
could
always
raise
as
much
money
as
he
liked
on
an
hypothecation
of
next
year
wool
but
we
had
not
come
to
that
yet
the
weather
was
delightful
the
customary
week
of
heavy
rain
just
after
our
midsummer
christmas
had
cooled
the
air
and
laid
the
dust
besides
bringing
out
a
fresh
green
tint
over
the
willows
and
poplars
and
causing
even
the
leaves
of
the
gums
to
lose
their
look
for
a
few
days
after
much
consultation
we
decided
to
go
by
coach
as
far
as
timaru
and
then
trust
to
circumstances
to
decide
our
future
means
of
transport
not
only
were
we
obliged
to
pay
a
large
sum
for
our
places
but
our
luggage
was
charged
for
by
the
pound
so
we
found
it
necessary
to
reduce
our
kit
to
the
most
modest
dimensions
and
only
to
take
what
was
absolutely
necessary
the
journey
was
a
long
and
weary
one
the
only
variety
being
caused
by
a
strong
spice
of
danger
at
each
river
at
some
streams
we
were
transferred
bodily
to
a
large
ferry
boat
and
so
taken
across
at
others
the
passengers
and
luggage
only
were
put
into
the
boat
the
lumbering
coach
with
its
leathern
springs
left
behind
whilst
the
horses
swam
in
our
wake
across
the
wide
and
rushing
river
to
be
to
another
coach
on
the
opposite
shore
the
rakaia
ashburton
and
rangitata
had
been
crossed
in
this
way
and
we
had
reached
the
otaio
a
smaller
river
when
we
found
a
new
mode
of
transport
awaiting
us
a
large
dray
with
a
couple
of
powerful
horses
was
in
readiness
and
into
this
springless
vehicle
we
were
unceremoniously
bundled
the
empty
coach
and
horses
was
driven
over
at
another
part
of
the
stream
i
shall
never
forget
the
jolting
the
river
must
have
been
at
least
a
quarter
of
a
mile
wide
at
that
reach
and
over
its
bed
of
boulders
and
rocks
we
bumped
in
the
middle
stretched
a
long
strip
of
shingle
which
seemed
as
smooth
as
turf
by
contrast
with
the
first
half
of
the
when
we
charged
into
the
water
again
our
driver
removed
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
looked
over
his
shoulder
and
remarked
river
come
down
since
mornin
best
tuck
up
your
feet
marms
all
i
can
answer
for
this
marm
tucking
up
her
feet
with
great
agility
and
not
a
moment
too
soon
either
for
as
a
light
wind
was
blowing
a
playful
wave
came
rippling
over
and
through
the
planked
floor
of
the
dray
floating
all
the
smaller
parcels
about
but
no
one
could
speak
we
were
so
jolted
it
literally
seemed
as
if
our
spines
come
through
the
crown
of
our
heads
and
i
expected
all
my
teeth
to
tumble
out
in
the
midst
of
my
fright
and
suffering
a
laugh
was
jolted
out
of
me
by
the
absurd
behaviour
of
one
of
our
he
was
what
is
called
a
bush
carpenter
a
wandering
carpenter
who
travels
from
station
to
station
doing
any
little
odd
rough
jobs
wanted
this
man
had
been
working
for
us
some
time
before
and
had
often
amused
me
with
his
quaint
ways
on
this
occasion
he
was
on
his
oppressively
good
behaviour
and
sat
quite
silent
and
solemn
on
the
opposite
ledge
of
the
dray
but
when
for
the
second
time
the
water
came
swirling
through
our
rude
conveyance
with
a
force
which
threatened
to
upset
it
altogether
dale
fumbled
in
his
pocket
as
if
he
were
seeking
for
a
produced
an
enormous
pair
of
green
goggle
spectacles
which
might
have
made
part
of
moses
primrose
purchases
at
the
fair
and
adjusting
them
on
his
nose
as
steadily
as
he
could
said
gravely
this
must
be
looked
to
he
continued
to
stare
at
the
wash
of
water
during
the
remainder
of
our
perilous
and
rough
transit
without
vouchsafing
any
explanation
of
his
meaning
but
after
we
had
safely
landed
he
replaced
his
spectacles
first
in
their
huge
shagreen
case
and
next
in
his
pocket
with
an
air
which
seemed
to
say
the
danger
is
now
over
thanks
to
my
precautions
timaru
was
reached
very
late
and
the
best
accommodation
at
the
inn
placed
at
our
disposal
still
in
those
distant
days
there
was
no
such
thing
as
a
private
sitting
room
and
we
had
all
to
eat
our
supper
in
the
same
little
apartment
but
in
all
my
varied
wanderings
in
different
parts
of
the
world
when
the
accidents
of
travel
have
thrown
me
for
a
time
among
the
class
whom
we
foolishly
speak
of
as
the
lower
orders
i
have
never
yet
had
to
complain
of
the
slightest
inconvenience
or
disagreeableness
from
my
on
the
contrary
i
have
always
received
the
most
chivalrous
politeness
at
their
hands
and
have
noticed
how
ready
they
were
to
forego
their
usual
tastes
and
habits
lest
they
should
cause
me
any
annoyance
i
wonder
whether
fine
gentlemen
in
their
splendid
clubs
would
be
quite
so
willing
to
spoil
the
pleasure
of
their
evening
if
any
accident
were
to
throw
an
unwelcome
lady
amongst
them
at
all
events
they
could
not
be
than
my
friends
in
fustian
jackets
have
always
proved
themselves
and
on
this
particular
evening
the
landlord
of
the
inn
was
so
amazed
at
the
orders
for
tea
and
coffee
instead
of
the
usual
nips
of
spirits
that
he
was
constrained
to
inquire
the
reason
a
stalwart
drover
who
was
sitting
opposite
to
me
at
the
rude
table
murmured
from
the
depths
of
his
great
beard
in
an
oracular
whisper
the
smell
of
speerits
be
agreeble
like
to
the
lady
in
vain
i
protested
that
i
did
not
mind
it
in
the
least
tea
and
coffee
was
the
order
of
the
evening
and
solemn
silence
and
good
behaviour
no
smoking
no
songs
no
conviviality
of
any
sort
i
would
fain
have
shown
my
appreciation
of
their
courtesy
by
talking
to
them
but
alas
i
was
one
vast
ache
all
over
although
the
road
had
been
a
dead
level
sixteen
hours
of
jolting
and
bumping
had
reduced
me
to
a
limp
creature
with
out
a
word
or
a
smile
of
course
i
retired
to
what
was
literally
a
pallet
and
a
very
hard
pallet
too
as
early
as
possible
but
even
after
i
had
vanished
behind
the
thin
wooden
partition
which
formed
my
bedroom
the
greatest
silence
and
decorum
continued
to
reign
among
my
chapter
vii
buying
a
continued
early
the
next
morning
we
all
breakfasted
together
and
then
separated
with
most
polite
adieux
we
sallied
forth
to
look
for
a
couple
of
riding
horses
there
were
none
to
be
hired
so
we
had
to
buy
two
nags
for
pounds
the
same
horses
would
not
fetch
more
than
pounds
and
i
have
been
told
that
in
australia
you
can
buy
a
horse
for
a
shilling
but
ours
in
new
zealand
have
never
sunk
lower
than
a
couple
of
pounds
if
they
had
any
legs
at
all
it
seemed
to
the
quite
a
superfluous
question
when
i
timidly
inquired
if
my
horse
had
ever
carried
a
lady
no
i
ca
just
say
as
he
has
mum
as
you
see
there
aint
no
ladies
in
these
parts
for
him
to
carry
but
he
added
magnanimously
i
try
him
with
a
blanket
fust
if
you
at
all
oneasy
about
him
we
did
not
start
until
the
next
day
as
we
had
to
hunt
up
and
i
had
to
sew
a
few
yards
of
grey
linsey
into
a
but
by
the
following
day
we
were
all
ready
and
our
swags
packed
and
strapped
to
the
saddles
by
nine
f
horse
looked
a
very
nice
one
in
every
respect
mine
was
evidently
uneasy
in
his
mind
at
the
strange
shape
of
his
saddle
and
i
was
recommended
to
mount
outside
the
little
enclosure
on
a
patch
of
open
ground
where
my
steed
would
not
be
able
to
brush
me
off
the
moment
i
mounted
the
hermit
as
he
was
called
made
for
a
dry
ditch
and
tried
to
lie
down
but
a
sharp
cut
from
a
brought
him
out
of
it
and
then
he
laid
his
ears
well
back
and
started
for
a
good
gallop
to
endeavour
to
get
rid
of
his
strange
rider
however
his
head
was
turned
in
the
right
direction
there
were
no
obstacles
in
the
way
and
before
he
got
tired
of
his
pace
we
had
left
timaru
a
good
many
miles
behind
us
f
looked
complacently
at
the
hermit
and
observed
he
carry
you
very
nicely
i
think
i
could
only
breathe
a
sincere
hope
that
he
might
it
was
a
beautiful
day
warm
but
not
oppressive
and
delightfully
calm
our
road
lay
at
first
along
the
ever
since
we
had
left
christchurch
the
ground
had
been
almost
level
and
the
road
consisted
merely
of
a
track
cleared
from
tussocks
on
our
left
extended
the
vast
strip
known
as
the
beach
whilst
far
on
our
right
between
us
and
the
west
coast
the
southern
alps
rose
in
all
their
might
and
beauty
sometimes
lightly
veiled
by
a
summer
haze
at
others
cutting
our
sky
sharp
and
clear
with
their
grand
outlines
our
horses
were
a
trifle
too
fat
for
good
condition
and
we
feared
to
hurry
them
the
first
day
so
we
made
an
early
halt
at
mahiki
only
a
twenty
miles
stage
but
the
next
day
they
took
us
on
to
waitaki
ferry
past
a
splendid
bush
and
so
into
the
heart
of
the
hill
country
between
the
ranges
beautiful
fertile
valleys
extended
when
i
say
fertile
i
mean
that
the
soil
was
excellent
and
the
land
but
there
was
no
cultivation
not
a
sod
had
ever
been
turned
there
since
the
creation
of
the
world
and
the
whole
country
wore
the
peculiar
yellow
tinge
caught
from
the
tall
waving
tussocks
which
is
the
prevailing
feature
of
new
zealand
scenery
every
acre
had
been
taken
up
but
as
yet
the
runs
were
rather
understocked
our
fourth
day
ride
was
the
longest
miles
in
all
though
we
halted
for
a
couple
of
hours
at
a
miserable
accommodation
house
our
bivouac
that
night
was
close
to
lake
wanaka
at
the
molyneux
and
there
i
was
kept
awake
all
night
by
the
attentions
of
a
cat
i
never
saw
such
a
ridiculous
animal
prince
for
that
was
his
name
took
the
greatest
fancy
to
me
or
rather
to
my
woollen
skirt
i
suppose
and
found
a
linsey
lap
much
more
comfortable
than
the
corduroy
knees
on
which
he
took
his
usual
evening
nap
at
all
events
he
followed
me
into
my
room
which
only
boasted
of
a
mattress
stuffed
with
by
the
way
on
the
floor
here
i
should
have
slept
very
well
after
my
long
journey
if
prince
would
have
permitted
it
in
vain
i
put
him
out
of
the
window
not
always
very
gently
he
returned
in
five
minutes
bringing
a
palpitating
bird
or
mouse
which
he
softly
dropped
on
my
face
and
purred
loudly
with
delight
at
his
own
gallantry
twenty
times
did
i
strike
a
match
that
night
and
try
to
restore
the
victims
to
life
only
one
recovered
sufficiently
to
be
released
and
prince
brought
it
in
again
quite
dead
five
minutes
later
i
shut
the
little
casement
window
but
the
room
became
so
hot
and
stuffy
and
suspicious
fumes
of
stale
beer
and
tobacco
began
to
assert
their
presence
so
that
i
found
myself
obliged
to
open
it
again
sometimes
the
victim
bones
were
crunched
close
to
my
ear
and
i
found
more
than
one
feather
in
my
hair
in
the
morning
never
was
any
one
so
persecuted
by
a
cat
as
i
was
by
prince
that
weary
night
the
next
day
we
got
to
a
station
known
as
johnson
it
was
just
at
the
head
of
the
lake
and
as
we
arrived
tolerably
early
in
the
forenoon
we
embarked
after
the
usual
station
dinner
of
mutton
tea
and
damper
on
lake
wanaka
alas
for
those
treacherous
blue
waters
we
had
only
a
little
boat
in
which
i
took
my
place
as
coxwain
and
after
pulling
for
a
mile
or
two
under
a
blazing
sun
over
short
chopping
waves
with
a
we
all
became
so
deadly
that
we
had
to
turn
back
as
soon
as
we
had
rested
and
recovered
a
council
of
war
was
held
as
to
our
movements
and
we
decided
in
spite
of
our
recent
experiences
to
turn
our
horses
who
had
done
quite
enough
for
the
present
out
on
the
run
and
so
make
our
way
down
the
lake
by
boat
already
f
was
beginning
to
look
anxious
for
he
perceived
that
even
after
the
head
of
the
lake
had
been
reached
the
wool
would
cost
an
enormous
sum
to
cart
down
to
either
oamaru
or
timaru
from
whence
alone
it
could
be
shipped
the
mile
or
two
of
the
run
which
lay
along
the
shore
of
the
lake
showed
us
frightfully
rough
country
a
dense
jungle
of
tussocks
and
thorny
bushes
choked
up
the
feed
and
made
it
impossible
to
drive
any
animals
through
it
even
supposing
that
good
pasturage
lay
beyond
still
we
hoped
that
we
might
be
looking
at
the
worst
portion
of
our
purchase
and
deter
mined
to
persevere
in
the
attempt
to
penetrate
to
the
furthest
end
of
our
new
property
accordingly
we
hired
a
safe
old
tub
of
a
boat
which
though
too
heavy
to
pull
was
warranted
to
sail
steadily
and
with
a
couple
of
men
some
cold
mutton
bread
tea
and
sugar
started
valiantly
on
our
cruise
but
the
blue
unclouded
weather
in
which
we
had
hitherto
basked
was
at
an
end
for
the
present
we
had
already
enjoyed
a
longer
succession
of
calm
days
than
usually
falls
to
the
lot
of
the
travellers
in
that
windy
middle
island
and
it
was
now
quite
time
for
the
imprisoned
to
have
his
turn
over
the
surface
of
the
domain
accordingly
the
first
day
sail
was
against
a
light
ominously
warm
and
we
only
made
any
way
at
all
by
keeping
up
a
complicated
system
of
tacking
the
start
had
not
been
an
early
one
so
darkness
found
us
but
little
advanced
on
our
voyage
and
we
passed
the
night
in
a
rough
shanty
on
beds
of
wrapped
in
our
red
blankets
tired
as
we
were
none
of
us
could
sleep
much
the
air
was
dry
and
parched
every
now
and
then
a
sough
of
the
rising
hot
gale
swept
through
our
crazy
shelter
without
cooling
us
and
warned
us
to
prepare
for
what
was
coming
our
only
chance
of
getting
on
was
to
make
an
early
start
for
fortunately
a
true
is
somewhat
of
a
sluggard
the
skies
wore
their
peculiar
chrysoprase
green
tint
except
towards
the
weather
quarter
where
heavy
banks
of
lurid
cloud
showed
that
the
enemy
was
collecting
in
force
even
the
hour
of
dawn
usually
so
crisp
and
cool
brought
no
sense
of
refreshment
to
our
languid
limbs
and
we
embarked
with
the
direst
forebodings
a
few
miles
further
up
the
lake
we
reached
an
hut
built
by
our
host
johnson
when
he
first
took
up
his
country
and
intended
to
push
his
boundary
as
far
as
this
he
soon
drew
in
his
lines
however
on
account
of
the
rough
nature
of
the
ground
the
hut
was
in
a
most
picturesque
spot
and
although
deserted
remained
still
in
good
repair
the
little
scrap
of
garden
ground
was
a
tangle
of
gooseberry
and
currant
bushes
among
which
potatoes
flourished
at
their
own
sweet
will
we
had
only
time
to
beach
the
boat
that
is
to
say
f
and
the
two
men
did
so
whilst
i
ran
backwards
and
forwards
with
the
blankets
and
provisions
before
the
hurricane
was
upon
us
henceforth
there
was
no
stirring
out
of
doors
until
the
gale
had
blown
itself
out
we
dragged
in
some
driftwood
barricaded
the
door
and
prepared
to
pass
the
time
as
well
as
we
could
oh
the
fleas
in
the
hut
the
ground
was
literally
alive
with
them
and
their
audacity
and
appetite
was
unparalleled
our
boatmen
sat
tranquilly
by
the
tiny
window
and
played
cribbage
incessantly
with
very
dirty
cards
and
a
board
made
out
of
a
small
bar
of
soap
as
for
me
i
turned
an
empty
box
up
on
its
end
so
as
to
get
out
of
the
way
of
the
fleas
and
perched
myself
on
it
finding
ample
occupation
in
defending
my
position
from
the
attacks
of
the
active
little
wretches
sometimes
i
felt
as
if
i
must
rush
out
into
the
lake
and
drown
myself
and
my
tormentors
together
it
was
very
bad
for
everybody
the
poor
boatmen
doubtless
wished
to
smoke
but
were
too
polite
to
do
anything
of
the
sort
f
had
nothing
whatever
to
read
except
a
torn
piece
of
an
old
at
least
two
years
old
which
we
had
brought
to
wrap
up
some
of
our
provisions
whilst
i
was
still
more
idle
and
wretched
two
weary
interminable
days
dragged
or
perhaps
i
should
say
blew
themselves
along
in
this
miserable
fashion
but
at
sundown
on
the
evening
of
the
third
day
the
wind
dropped
suddenly
and
we
did
not
lose
a
moment
in
darting
out
of
our
prison
and
embarking
once
more
for
the
first
time
since
we
started
we
could
perceive
the
grandeur
of
the
surrounding
country
but
grand
scenery
is
not
necessary
nor
indeed
desirable
in
a
sheep
run
splendid
mountains
ran
down
in
steep
spurs
to
the
very
shore
of
the
enormous
lake
behind
them
piled
in
snowy
steeps
rose
the
distant
alps
of
the
antipodes
great
masses
of
native
bush
made
dark
purple
shadows
among
the
clefts
of
the
hills
whilst
the
lake
rippled
in
and
out
of
many
a
graceful
bay
and
quiet
harbour
not
a
fleck
or
film
of
cloud
floated
between
us
and
the
serene
and
darkening
sky
a
profound
delightful
calm
brooded
over
land
and
water
although
there
was
no
moon
the
stars
served
us
as
lights
and
compass
until
two
in
the
morning
by
which
time
we
had
reached
the
head
of
the
lake
which
is
miles
in
length
where
we
landed
extemporized
a
tent
out
of
the
boat
sail
and
turned
in
for
a
refreshing
sleep
the
next
day
was
beautifully
still
with
a
light
air
from
the
opposite
point
just
sufficient
to
cool
the
parched
atmosphere
and
we
made
our
way
along
the
head
of
the
lake
to
a
place
were
a
couple
of
sawyers
were
at
work
one
of
them
had
brought
his
wife
with
him
and
her
welcome
to
me
was
the
most
touching
thing
in
the
world
she
took
me
entirely
under
her
care
and
would
hardly
let
me
out
of
her
sight
i
must
say
it
was
very
nice
to
be
waited
on
so
faithfully
and
i
gave
myself
up
to
the
unaccustomed
luxury
all
she
required
of
me
in
exchange
for
her
incessant
toil
on
my
behalf
was
news
it
did
not
matter
of
what
kind
every
scrap
of
intelligence
was
welcome
to
her
and
she
refused
to
tell
me
to
what
date
her
latest
advices
extended
during
the
three
days
of
our
stay
in
that
clearing
among
the
great
pines
of
the
wanaka
bush
i
gave
my
hostess
a
complete
abridgment
of
the
history
of
england
political
social
and
moral
beginning
from
my
earliest
recollections
then
we
ran
over
contemporary
foreign
affairs
dwelt
minutely
on
every
scrap
of
colonial
news
and
finally
wound
up
with
a
full
true
and
particular
account
of
myself
and
all
my
relations
and
friends
when
i
paused
for
breath
she
would
cease
her
washing
and
cooking
on
my
behalf
and
say
entreatingly
go
on
now
do
until
i
felt
quite
desperate
all
this
time
whilst
i
was
being
interviewed
nearly
to
death
f
employed
himself
in
making
excursions
to
different
parts
of
the
run
one
of
the
sawyers
lent
him
a
miserable
little
pony
and
he
penetrated
to
another
sawyer
hut
seven
miles
distant
up
the
matukituki
river
but
no
matter
whether
he
turned
his
steps
to
north
or
south
east
or
west
he
met
with
the
same
disheartening
report
there
was
the
ground
indeed
but
it
was
perfectly
useless
not
only
was
there
was
pasturage
but
if
there
had
been
the
nature
of
the
country
would
have
rendered
it
valueless
on
account
of
the
way
it
was
overgrown
it
would
be
tedious
to
explain
more
minutely
why
this
was
the
case
sufficient
must
it
be
to
say
that
whilst
f
was
only
too
anxious
to
keep
his
eyes
shut
as
to
the
ground
he
had
alighted
on
after
his
leap
in
the
dark
and
the
sawyers
were
equally
anxious
to
induce
settlers
to
come
there
and
so
bring
a
market
for
their
labour
close
to
their
hand
nothing
could
make
our
purchase
appear
anything
except
a
dead
loss
as
for
the
plans
they
were
purely
imaginary
the
blue
lake
was
about
the
only
part
true
to
nature
and
even
that
should
have
had
a
to
state
that
it
was
generally
lashed
into
high
unnavigable
waves
by
a
chronic
no
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
go
home
again
to
the
little
run
which
had
seemed
such
a
mere
paddock
in
our
eyes
whilst
we
indulged
in
over
acres
of
country
it
was
of
no
use
lingering
amid
such
disappointment
and
discomfort
besides
which
my
listener
the
sawyer
wife
had
turned
her
husband
and
herself
out
of
their
hut
and
were
sleeping
under
a
red
blanket
tent
poor
woman
she
was
most
anxious
to
get
away
and
the
lovely
sylvan
scene
with
the
tall
trees
standing
like
sentinels
over
their
prostrate
brethren
the
wealth
of
beauteous
greenery
springing
through
fronds
of
fern
and
ground
creepers
the
flight
of
paroquets
and
other
bush
birds
even
the
vast
expanse
of
the
lake
which
stretched
almost
from
their
threshold
for
so
many
miles
all
would
have
been
gladly
exchanged
for
a
dusty
high
street
in
any
country
her
last
words
were
you
send
me
a
paper
or
hany
thing
printed
mam
i
faithfully
promised
to
do
my
best
and
carried
out
my
share
of
the
bargain
by
despatching
to
her
a
large
packet
of
miscellaneous
periodicals
and
newspapers
but
whether
she
ever
received
them
is
more
than
i
can
say
we
were
afraid
of
lingering
too
long
lest
another
should
become
due
and
we
therefore
started
as
soon
as
f
had
decided
that
it
was
of
no
use
exploring
our
wretched
purchase
any
further
we
had
a
stiff
breeze
from
the
all
the
way
down
the
lake
but
as
it
was
right
it
helped
us
along
to
such
good
purpose
that
one
day
sailing
before
it
brought
us
back
to
johnson
homestead
and
comparative
civilization
the
little
parlour
and
the
tiny
beyond
into
which
i
could
only
get
access
by
climbing
through
a
window
for
the
architect
had
forgotten
to
put
a
door
appeared
like
apartments
in
a
spacious
palace
so
great
was
the
contrast
between
their
snug
comfort
and
the
desolate
misery
of
our
hut
life
of
course
nothing
else
was
talked
of
except
our
disappointment
at
our
new
run
and
although
johnson
had
indulged
in
forebodings
which
were
only
too
literally
fulfilled
he
had
the
good
taste
never
to
remind
us
of
his
prophecies
of
all
the
forms
of
human
woe
defend
me
from
that
dread
told
you
so
after
a
day
halt
and
rest
we
mounted
our
much
refreshed
horses
and
set
our
faces
straight
across
country
for
dunedin
this
is
very
easy
to
write
but
it
was
not
quite
so
easy
to
do
we
could
only
ride
for
the
first
miles
which
we
accomplished
in
two
days
these
stages
brought
us
to
the
foot
of
the
dunstan
range
and
near
the
of
that
name
i
would
fain
have
turned
aside
to
see
them
but
we
had
not
time
however
we
felt
the
auriferous
influence
of
the
locality
for
a
perfect
stranger
came
up
to
us
whilst
we
were
baiting
at
another
place
called
the
kaiwarara
diggings
and
offered
to
buy
our
horses
from
us
for
pounds
each
and
also
to
purchase
our
saddles
and
bridles
at
a
fair
price
this
was
exactly
what
we
wanted
as
we
had
intended
to
sell
them
at
dunedin
and
i
was
no
ways
disinclined
to
part
with
the
hermit
who
retained
the
sulky
misanthropical
temper
which
had
earned
him
his
name
he
was
now
pronounced
fit
to
carry
a
lady
and
purchased
to
be
sold
again
at
the
diggings
whether
there
were
any
ladies
there
or
not
i
can
not
tell
of
course
before
parting
with
our
nags
we
ascertained
that
the
ubiquitous
cobb
coach
started
from
our
resting
place
for
dunedin
next
day
and
we
made
the
rest
of
our
journey
in
one
of
that
line
its
leathern
springs
whilst
not
so
liable
to
break
by
sudden
jolts
impart
a
swinging
rocking
motion
to
the
body
of
the
vehicle
which
is
most
disagreeable
but
rough
and
rude
as
they
are
they
deserve
to
be
looked
upon
with
respect
as
the
pioneers
of
civilization
all
over
america
australia
and
now
new
zealand
the
moment
passengers
are
forthcoming
that
moment
the
enterprising
firm
starts
a
coach
and
the
vehicle
runs
until
it
is
ousted
by
a
railway
all
previous
tracks
which
i
had
journeyed
over
seemed
smooth
turnpike
roads
compared
to
that
terrible
tussocky
track
which
led
to
dunedin
but
that
bright
little
town
was
reached
at
last
the
hotel
welcomed
us
tired
and
bruised
travellers
that
we
were
and
next
evening
we
started
in
the
for
port
lyttleton
this
little
coasting
steamer
seemed
to
touch
at
every
hamlet
along
the
coast
and
after
each
pause
i
had
to
begin
afresh
my
agonies
of
there
was
no
such
thing
as
getting
one
for
we
were
seldom
more
than
a
few
hours
outside
and
had
no
chance
of
getting
used
to
the
horrible
motion
timaru
was
reached
next
day
but
we
had
suffered
so
frightfully
during
the
night
from
a
chopping
sea
and
an
open
roadstead
that
we
went
on
shore
and
entrusted
ourselves
once
more
to
the
old
coach
it
seemed
better
to
endure
the
miseries
we
knew
of
than
to
make
experiments
in
wretchedness
so
we
went
through
the
old
jolting
and
jumbling
until
we
were
dropped
at
an
accommodation
house
fifteen
miles
from
christchurch
where
we
slept
that
night
and
at
daylight
despatched
a
messenger
to
the
next
station
for
our
own
horses
he
had
only
miles
to
ride
and
about
we
started
to
meet
him
on
hired
horses
which
we
were
very
glad
to
exchange
for
better
nags
a
stage
further
on
and
so
we
rode
quietly
home
in
the
gloaming
winding
up
the
lovely
tranquil
valley
at
whose
head
stood
our
own
snug
little
homestead
at
first
we
were
so
glad
to
be
safely
at
hone
again
that
we
scarcely
gave
a
thought
to
our
fruitless
enterprise
but
as
our
bruised
bodies
became
rested
and
restored
our
hearts
began
to
ache
when
we
thought
of
the
money
we
had
so
rashly
flung
away
in
buying
a
run
chapter
viii
looking
for
a
congregation
it
is
to
be
hoped
and
expected
that
such
a
good
understanding
has
been
established
between
my
readers
and
myself
by
this
time
that
they
will
not
find
the
general
title
of
these
papers
unsuitable
to
the
heading
of
this
particular
chapter
indeed
i
may
truly
say
that
looking
back
upon
the
many
happy
memories
of
my
three
years
life
in
that
lovely
and
beloved
middle
island
no
pleasures
stand
out
more
vividly
than
my
evening
rides
up
winding
gullies
or
across
low
in
search
of
a
shepherd
hut
or
a
nest
a
peculiar
brightness
seems
to
rest
on
those
peaks
of
memory
landscape
and
it
is
but
fitting
that
it
should
be
so
for
other
excursions
or
expeditions
used
to
be
undertaken
merely
for
business
or
pleasure
but
these
delicious
wanderings
were
in
search
of
scattered
dwellings
whose
lonely
inhabitants
far
removed
from
church
privileges
for
many
a
long
year
past
might
be
bidden
nay
entreated
to
come
to
us
on
sunday
afternoons
and
attend
the
service
we
held
at
home
weekly
and
here
i
feel
constrained
to
say
a
word
to
those
whose
eyes
may
haply
rest
on
my
pages
and
who
may
find
themselves
in
the
coming
years
in
perhaps
the
same
position
as
i
did
a
short
time
ago
a
new
comer
to
a
new
country
is
sure
to
be
discouraged
if
he
or
she
particularly
i
fancy
should
attempt
to
revive
or
introduce
any
custom
which
has
been
neglected
or
overlooked
this
is
especially
the
case
with
religious
observances
at
every
turn
one
is
met
by
disheartening
warnings
oh
the
people
here
are
very
different
to
those
in
the
old
country
they
would
look
upon
it
as
impertinence
if
you
suggested
they
should
come
to
church
you
will
find
a
few
may
come
just
at
first
and
then
when
the
novelty
wears
off
and
they
have
seen
all
the
pretty
things
in
your
drawing
room
not
a
soul
will
ever
come
near
the
place
if
even
the
men
do
say
something
very
free
and
easy
to
you
when
you
invite
them
to
your
house
on
sunday
afternoons
you
may
depend
upon
it
that
after
two
or
three
weeks
you
will
not
know
how
to
keep
them
in
order
such
and
many
more
were
the
discouraging
remarks
made
when
i
consulted
my
neighbours
about
my
plan
for
collecting
the
shepherds
from
the
surrounding
runs
and
holding
a
church
of
england
service
every
sunday
afternoon
at
our
own
little
homestead
to
my
mind
the
distances
seemed
the
greatest
obstacle
as
many
of
the
men
i
wanted
to
reach
lived
or
even
thirty
miles
away
with
very
rough
country
between
i
had
no
fear
of
impertinence
for
it
is
unknown
to
me
and
seldom
comes
i
fancy
unprovoked
whilst
with
regard
to
the
novelty
wearing
off
and
the
men
ceasing
to
attend
that
must
be
left
in
god
hands
we
could
only
endeavour
to
plant
the
good
seed
and
trust
to
him
to
give
the
increase
it
was
a
great
comfort
to
me
in
those
early
days
that
f
who
had
been
many
years
in
the
colony
never
joined
in
the
disheartening
prophecies
i
have
alluded
to
although
as
naturally
averse
to
reading
aloud
before
strangers
as
a
man
who
had
lived
a
solitary
life
would
be
sure
to
be
he
promised
at
once
with
a
good
grace
to
read
the
evening
service
and
a
sermon
afterwards
and
thus
smoothed
one
difficulty
over
directly
his
advice
to
me
was
precisely
what
i
would
fain
repeat
try
by
all
means
if
you
fail
you
will
at
least
feel
you
have
made
the
attempt
may
all
who
try
succeed
as
we
did
i
believe
firmly
they
will
for
it
is
an
undertaking
on
which
god
blessing
is
sure
to
rest
and
there
are
no
such
fertilizing
dews
as
those
which
fall
from
heaven
the
mists
arising
from
earth
are
only
miasmic
vapours
after
all
but
i
fear
to
linger
too
long
on
the
end
instead
of
telling
you
about
the
means
it
was
may
when
we
were
fairly
settled
in
our
new
home
at
the
head
of
a
valley
with
us
that
month
answers
to
your
november
but
fogs
are
unknown
in
that
breezy
middle
island
and
my
first
winter
in
canterbury
was
a
beautiful
season
heralded
in
by
an
exquisite
autumn
how
crisp
the
mornings
and
evenings
were
with
ever
so
light
a
film
of
hoar
frost
making
a
splendid
sparkle
on
every
blade
of
waving
then
in
the
middle
of
the
day
the
delicious
warmth
of
the
sun
tempted
one
to
linger
all
day
in
the
open
air
and
i
never
wearied
of
gazing
at
the
strange
purple
shadows
cast
by
a
passing
cloud
or
up
beyond
the
floating
vapourous
wreath
to
the
heaven
of
brilliant
blue
which
smiled
upon
us
and
yet
when
i
come
to
think
of
it
i
do
know
that
i
had
much
time
to
spare
for
glancing
at
either
hills
or
skies
for
we
were
just
settling
ourselves
in
a
new
place
and
no
one
knows
what
means
unless
they
have
tried
it
fifty
miles
away
from
the
nearest
shop
the
yeast
alone
was
a
perpetual
anxiety
to
me
it
would
not
keep
beyond
a
certain
time
and
had
a
tendency
to
explode
its
confining
bottles
in
the
middle
of
the
night
so
it
became
necessary
to
make
it
in
smaller
quantities
every
ten
days
or
so
if
by
any
chance
i
forgot
to
remind
my
damsels
to
replenish
the
yeast
bottles
they
used
up
the
last
drop
and
then
would
come
smilingly
to
me
with
the
remark
there
aint
not
a
drop
o
yeast
about
anywhere
mum
this
entailed
or
scones
or
soda
bread
or
some
indigestible
compound
for
at
least
three
days
as
it
was
of
no
use
attempting
to
make
proper
bread
until
the
yeast
had
worked
then
the
well
needed
to
be
deepened
a
kitchen
garden
had
to
be
made
shelter
to
be
provided
for
the
fowls
and
pigs
a
shed
to
be
put
up
for
coals
a
thousand
things
which
entailed
thought
and
trouble
had
to
be
done
it
is
true
these
rough
jobs
were
not
exactly
in
my
line
but
indoors
i
was
just
as
busy
trying
to
make
big
things
fit
into
little
spaces
and
we
could
not
afford
to
take
things
coolly
and
do
a
little
every
day
for
at
that
time
of
year
an
hour
change
in
the
wind
might
have
brought
a
heavy
fall
of
snow
or
a
sharp
frost
or
a
deluge
of
rain
down
upon
the
uncovered
and
defenceless
heads
of
our
live
stock
the
poor
dear
sheep
the
source
of
our
income
were
after
all
the
least
for
creatures
on
the
station
a
well
grassed
and
watered
run
with
sunny
vallies
for
winter
feeding
and
green
hills
for
summer
pasturage
had
been
provided
by
antipodean
nature
for
them
and
to
these
advantages
we
only
added
some
twenty
or
miles
of
wire
fencing
and
then
they
were
left
to
themselves
with
a
couple
of
shepherds
to
look
after
fifteen
thousand
sheep
all
the
year
round
but
yet
busy
as
we
were
we
found
time
to
look
up
a
congregation
the
very
first
sunday
afternoon
whilst
we
were
still
in
the
midst
of
a
chaos
of
chips
and
big
boxes
and
straw
and
empty
our
own
shepherds
came
over
by
invitation
and
the
only
very
near
neighbours
we
had
a
scotch
and
his
charming
young
wife
and
we
held
a
service
in
the
drawing
room
after
it
was
ended
we
had
a
long
talk
with
the
men
and
they
confessed
that
they
had
enjoyed
it
very
much
and
would
like
to
come
regularly
when
questioned
as
to
the
feasibility
of
inducing
others
to
join
they
said
that
it
might
be
suggested
to
more
than
one
distant
lonely
but
his
uncontrollable
shyness
would
probably
prevent
his
attendance
jim
salter
and
joe
bennett
and
a
lot
more
on
would
be
glad
enow
to
come
if
so
be
they
could
feel
as
how
they
was
truly
wellcombe
said
our
shepherd
pepper
who
prided
himself
on
the
elegance
and
correctness
of
his
phraseology
he
added
after
a
reflective
pause
turning
bashfully
away
if
so
be
as
the
lady
would
just
look
round
and
give
a
call
they
be
to
be
persuaded
belike
so
the
scheme
was
pepper
after
all
you
see
but
this
looking
round
to
which
he
alluded
so
airily
meant
scrambling
rides
varying
from
ten
to
miles
in
length
over
country
and
this
on
the
slender
chance
of
finding
the
men
now
a
new
zealand
shepherd
almost
lives
out
on
the
hills
so
the
prospect
of
finding
any
of
our
congregation
at
home
was
slight
indeed
however
as
i
said
before
f
stood
by
me
and
although
we
neither
of
us
could
well
spare
the
time
we
agreed
to
devote
two
afternoons
every
week
so
long
as
the
fine
open
autumn
weather
lasted
to
making
excursions
in
search
of
huts
there
are
no
roads
or
finger
posts
or
guides
of
any
sort
in
those
distant
places
when
we
inquired
what
was
the
name
of
mills
shepherd
the
masters
are
always
plain
smith
or
jones
and
the
shepherds
in
the
colonies
the
answer
was
generally
very
vague
wiry
bill
we
mostly
calls
but
i
think
i
heerd
say
his
rightful
name
was
mr
pellet
mum
he
a
little
chap
as
strong
as
the
explained
pepper
who
was
an
incorrigible
cockney
and
he
lives
over
there
pointing
with
his
thumb
to
a
mountain
range
behind
us
he
in
one
of
them
blind
gullies
you
go
along
the
gorge
of
the
river
till
you
come
to
a
saddle
all
over
fern
and
you
drop
down
that
and
follow
the
best
o
three
or
four
tracts
till
you
come
to
a
swamp
here
pepper
paused
in
consideration
of
my
face
of
horror
for
if
there
was
one
thing
i
dreaded
more
than
another
in
those
early
days
it
was
a
swamp
steep
hill
sides
wide
creeks
flats
all
came
in
the
day
ride
but
a
swamp
ugh
the
horrible
treacherous
thing
so
green
and
innocent
looking
with
here
and
there
a
quicksand
or
a
peaty
morass
in
which
without
a
moment
warning
your
horse
sank
up
to
his
withers
it
was
dreadful
and
when
we
came
to
such
a
place
helen
used
to
stop
dead
short
prick
her
pretty
ears
well
forward
and
trembling
with
fear
and
excitement
put
her
nose
close
to
the
ground
smelling
every
inch
before
she
would
place
her
fore
foot
down
on
it
jumping
off
it
like
a
goat
if
it
proved
insecure
generally
she
crossed
a
swamp
by
a
series
of
bounds
in
and
out
of
flax
bushes
and
hopeless
indeed
would
a
morass
be
without
those
green
cities
of
refuge
horrible
as
a
large
swamp
is
however
to
a
timid
horsewoman
it
is
dear
to
the
heart
of
a
cockatoo
he
gladly
buys
a
freehold
of
fifty
acres
in
the
midst
of
one
burns
it
makes
a
sod
fence
sown
with
gorse
seed
all
round
his
section
drains
it
in
a
rough
and
ready
fashion
and
then
the
splendid
fertile
soil
which
has
been
waiting
for
so
many
thousand
years
brings
forth
fruit
abundantly
such
enormous
fields
of
wheat
and
oats
and
barley
as
you
come
upon
sometimes
with
alas
never
a
market
near
enough
to
enable
the
plenteous
crop
to
return
sevenfold
into
its
master
bosom
i
shall
not
inflict
upon
you
a
description
of
all
our
rides
in
search
of
members
for
our
congregation
two
in
widely
differing
directions
will
serve
as
specimens
of
such
excursions
in
consideration
of
my
f
selected
a
comparatively
easy
track
for
our
first
ride
and
yet
bad
was
the
best
might
surely
be
said
of
that
breakneck
path
what
would
an
english
horse
or
an
english
lady
say
to
riding
for
miles
over
a
slippery
winding
ledge
on
a
rocky
hill
side
where
a
wall
of
solid
mountain
rose
up
perpendicularly
on
the
right
hand
and
on
the
left
a
very
respectable
sized
river
hurried
over
its
boulders
far
beneath
the
aerial
path
yet
this
was
comparatively
a
safe
track
and
presented
but
one
serious
obstacle
over
which
i
was
ruthlessly
taken
it
is
perhaps
needless
to
say
we
were
riding
in
single
file
and
equally
unnecessary
to
state
that
i
was
the
last
for
certainly
we
should
never
have
made
much
progress
otherwise
helen
my
bay
mare
would
follow
her
stable
companion
on
which
f
was
mounted
so
that
was
the
way
we
got
on
at
all
a
sudden
sharp
turn
showed
me
what
appeared
to
be
a
low
stone
wall
running
own
the
spur
of
the
mountain
right
across
our
track
and
i
had
already
begun
to
disquiet
myself
about
the
possibility
of
turning
back
on
such
a
narrow
ledge
when
i
saw
f
powerful
black
horse
with
his
ears
well
forward
and
his
reins
lying
loose
on
his
neck
make
a
sort
of
rush
at
the
obstacle
climb
up
it
as
a
cat
would
stand
for
an
instant
exactly
like
a
performing
goat
with
all
four
legs
drawn
closely
together
under
him
and
then
with
a
spring
disappear
on
the
other
side
this
wall
i
thought
must
be
but
loosely
built
for
has
displaced
some
of
the
stones
from
its
coping
helen
pretty
dear
hurried
after
her
friend
and
leader
and
before
i
had
time
to
realize
what
she
was
going
to
do
she
was
balancing
herself
on
the
crumbling
summit
of
this
stone
wall
which
was
only
the
freak
of
a
landslip
and
as
it
proved
impossible
to
remain
there
perched
like
a
bird
on
a
very
insecure
branch
nothing
remained
except
to
gather
herself
well
together
and
jump
off
but
what
a
jump
the
ground
fell
sheer
away
at
the
foot
of
the
wall
and
left
a
chasm
many
feet
wide
which
the
horse
could
not
see
until
it
had
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
wall
and
as
turning
back
was
out
of
the
question
the
only
alternative
was
to
give
a
vigorous
bound
on
to
the
narrow
ledge
beyond
terrified
as
i
felt
i
luckily
refrained
from
jerking
helen
head
or
attempting
to
guide
her
in
any
way
the
only
chance
of
safety
over
new
zealand
tracks
or
new
zealand
creeks
is
to
leave
your
horse
to
itself
i
have
seen
men
who
were
reckoned
good
riders
in
england
get
the
most
ignominious
tumbles
from
a
disregard
of
this
advice
an
horse
knows
perfectly
well
the
only
sound
spots
in
a
swamp
or
the
only
sound
part
of
a
creek
banks
if
his
rider
persists
in
taking
him
over
the
latter
where
he
himself
thinks
it
narrowest
and
safest
he
is
pretty
sure
to
find
the
earth
rotten
and
crumbling
and
to
pay
for
his
obstinacy
by
a
wetting
whilst
in
the
case
of
a
swamp
the
consequences
are
even
more
serious
and
the
horse
often
gets
badly
strained
in
floundering
out
of
a
quagmire
but
it
was
not
all
danger
and
difficulty
and
the
many
varieties
of
scene
in
the
course
of
a
long
ride
constituted
some
of
its
chief
charms
at
first
perhaps
after
we
had
left
our
own
fair
valley
behind
the
track
would
wind
through
the
gorge
of
a
river
with
lofty
mountains
rising
sheer
up
from
the
water
side
all
here
was
sad
and
grey
and
very
solemn
in
its
eternal
silence
only
made
more
intense
by
the
ceaseless
monotonous
roar
of
the
water
then
we
would
emerge
on
acres
and
acres
of
softly
rolling
downs
higher
than
the
hillocks
we
call
by
that
name
at
home
but
still
marvellously
beautiful
in
their
swelling
curves
all
folding
so
softly
into
each
other
and
dotted
with
mobs
of
sheep
making
pastoral
music
to
a
ear
over
this
sort
of
ground
we
could
canter
gaily
along
with
hector
f
pet
colley
keeping
close
to
the
heels
of
his
master
horse
for
it
is
the
worst
of
bad
manners
in
a
colley
to
look
at
a
neighbour
sheep
the
etiquette
in
passing
through
a
strange
run
is
for
the
dog
to
go
on
the
off
side
of
his
master
horse
so
that
the
sheep
shall
not
even
see
him
and
this
piece
of
courtly
politeness
hector
always
practised
of
his
own
accord
a
wire
fence
always
proved
a
very
tiresome
obstacle
for
horses
have
a
great
dread
of
them
and
will
not
be
induced
to
jump
them
on
any
account
if
we
could
find
out
where
the
gate
was
well
and
good
but
as
it
might
be
half
a
dozen
miles
off
on
one
side
or
the
other
we
seldom
lost
time
or
patience
in
seeking
it
when
there
was
no
help
for
it
and
such
a
fence
had
to
be
crossed
the
proceedings
were
always
the
same
f
dismounted
and
unfastened
one
of
his
stirrup
leathers
with
this
he
strapped
the
wires
as
firmly
as
possible
together
but
if
the
fence
had
been
lately
it
was
sometimes
a
difficult
task
still
he
generally
made
one
spot
lower
than
the
rest
and
over
this
he
proceeded
to
adjust
his
coat
very
carefully
he
then
vaulted
lightly
over
himself
and
calling
upon
me
to
aid
by
sundry
flicks
on
flank
the
horse
would
be
induced
to
jump
over
it
this
was
always
a
work
of
time
and
trouble
for
leo
hated
doing
it
and
would
rather
have
leaped
the
widest
winter
creek
than
jumped
the
lowest
wire
fence
helen
had
to
jump
with
me
on
her
back
and
without
any
friendly
whip
to
urge
her
but
except
once
when
she
caught
her
hind
leg
in
the
sleeve
of
the
coat
which
was
hanging
over
the
fence
and
tore
it
completely
out
she
got
over
very
well
upon
that
occasion
f
had
to
carry
his
sleeve
in
his
pocket
until
we
reached
the
neat
little
hut
where
jim
salter
lived
and
where
we
were
pretty
sure
to
find
a
housewife
for
shepherds
are
as
handy
as
sailors
with
a
needle
and
thread
i
shall
always
believe
that
some
bird
of
the
air
had
carried
the
matter
to
salter
because
not
only
was
he
at
home
and
in
his
sunday
clothes
but
he
had
made
a
cake
the
evening
before
and
that
was
a
very
suspicious
circumstance
however
we
pretended
not
to
imagine
that
we
were
expected
and
jim
pretended
with
equal
success
to
be
much
surprised
at
our
visit
so
both
sides
were
satisfied
nothing
could
be
neater
than
the
inside
of
the
little
hut
its
cob
walls
papered
with
old
illustrated
london
news
not
only
pictures
but
its
tiny
window
as
clean
as
possible
a
new
rug
laid
down
before
the
open
fireplace
where
a
bright
wood
fire
was
sputtering
and
cracking
cheerily
and
the
inevitable
kettle
suspended
from
a
hook
up
the
low
chimney
outside
the
had
been
newly
thatched
with
tohi
grass
the
garden
weeded
and
freshly
dug
the
and
as
clean
as
scrubbing
could
make
them
it
was
too
late
in
the
year
for
fruit
but
salter
currant
raspberry
and
gooseberry
bushes
gave
us
a
good
idea
of
how
well
he
must
have
fared
in
the
summer
the
fowls
were
just
devouring
the
last
of
the
shoots
and
the
potatoes
had
been
blackened
by
our
first
frosts
it
was
all
very
nice
and
trim
and
comfortable
except
the
loneliness
that
must
have
been
simply
awful
it
is
difficult
to
realise
how
completely
cut
off
from
the
society
of
his
kind
a
new
zealand
shepherd
is
especially
at
an
like
this
once
in
every
three
months
he
goes
down
to
the
homestead
borrows
the
pack
horse
and
leads
it
up
to
his
hut
with
a
quarter
rations
of
flour
tea
sugar
and
salt
of
course
he
provides
himself
with
mutton
and
firewood
and
his
simple
wants
are
thus
supplied
after
shearing
about
january
his
wages
are
paid
varying
from
pounds
to
pounds
a
year
according
to
the
locality
and
then
he
gets
a
week
leave
to
go
down
to
the
nearest
town
if
he
be
a
prudent
steady
man
as
our
friend
salter
was
he
puts
his
money
in
the
bank
or
lends
it
out
on
a
freehold
mortgage
at
ten
per
only
deducting
a
few
pounds
from
his
capital
for
a
suit
of
clothes
a
couple
of
pair
of
cookham
boots
for
hill
walking
and
above
all
some
new
books
without
any
exception
the
shepherds
i
came
across
in
new
zealand
were
all
passionately
fond
of
reading
and
they
were
also
men
who
often
expressed
themselves
in
excellent
through
superfine
language
their
libraries
chiefly
consisted
of
novels
and
out
of
my
visits
in
search
of
a
congregation
grew
a
scheme
for
a
to
supply
something
better
in
the
way
of
literature
which
was
afterwards
most
successfully
carried
out
but
of
this
i
need
not
speak
here
for
we
are
still
seated
inside
salter
hut
so
small
in
its
dimensions
that
it
could
hardly
have
held
another
guest
womanlike
my
eyes
were
everywhere
and
i
presently
spied
out
an
empty
bottle
labelled
worcestershire
sauce
dear
me
salter
i
cried
i
had
no
idea
you
were
so
grand
as
to
have
sauces
up
here
why
we
hardly
ever
use
them
well
mum
replied
salter
bashfully
and
stroking
his
long
black
beard
to
gain
time
to
select
the
grandest
words
he
could
think
of
it
is
hardly
to
be
regarded
in
the
light
of
happetite
that
there
bottle
it
is
more
in
the
nature
of
remedies
then
seeing
that
i
still
looked
mystified
he
added
you
see
mum
although
we
gets
our
uncommon
well
in
these
salubrious
mountings
still
a
drop
of
physic
is
often
and
in
a
general
way
i
always
purchase
myself
a
box
of
holloway
pills
of
which
you
do
get
such
a
lot
for
your
money
and
also
a
bottle
of
but
last
shearing
they
was
out
o
they
said
so
they
put
me
up
a
bottle
o
cain
pepper
and
likewise
that
condiment
which
was
werry
efficacious
towards
the
end
the
bottle
and
do
you
really
mean
to
say
you
drank
it
salter
i
inquired
with
horror
certainly
i
do
mum
whenever
i
felt
out
o
sorts
it
always
took
my
mind
off
the
loneliness
and
cheered
me
up
wonderful
especial
if
i
hadded
a
little
red
pepper
to
it
said
salter
getting
up
from
his
log
of
wood
and
making
me
a
low
bow
all
this
time
f
and
i
were
seated
amicably
side
by
side
on
poor
salter
red
bunk
or
wooden
bedstead
made
of
empty
nailed
between
rough
poles
and
other
sacks
filled
with
tussock
grass
for
a
mattress
and
pillow
the
word
loneliness
gave
me
a
good
opening
to
broach
the
subject
of
our
sunday
gatherings
and
my
suspicions
of
jim
having
been
told
of
our
visit
were
confirmed
by
the
alacrity
with
which
he
said
i
have
much
pleasure
in
accepting
your
kind
invitation
mum
if
so
be
as
i
am
not
intruding
no
indeed
salter
f
said
you
be
very
welcome
and
you
could
always
turn
judy
into
the
paddock
whilst
we
were
having
service
now
if
there
was
one
thing
dearer
to
salter
heart
than
another
it
was
his
little
roan
mare
judy
her
excellent
condition
and
jaunty
little
and
tail
testified
to
her
master
loving
care
so
it
was
all
happily
settled
and
after
paying
a
most
unfashionably
long
visit
to
the
lonely
man
we
rode
away
with
many
a
farewell
nod
and
smile
i
may
say
here
that
salter
was
one
of
the
most
regular
of
our
congregation
for
more
than
two
years
besides
being
a
member
of
the
book
club
in
time
its
more
sensible
volumes
utterly
displaced
the
yellow
paper
rubbish
in
his
but
library
and
i
never
can
forget
the
poor
man
emotion
when
he
came
to
bid
me
at
my
request
he
made
the
rough
little
pen
and
ink
sketches
which
are
here
given
and
as
he
held
my
offered
hand
not
knowing
quite
what
else
to
do
with
it
when
i
took
leave
of
him
after
our
last
when
my
face
was
set
towards
england
he
could
not
say
a
word
the
great
burly
creature
heart
must
have
been
nearly
as
big
as
his
body
and
he
seemed
hardly
to
know
that
large
tears
were
rolling
down
his
sunburnt
face
and
losing
themselves
in
his
bushy
beard
i
tried
to
be
cheerful
myself
but
he
kept
repeating
it
is
only
natural
you
should
be
glad
to
go
yet
it
is
very
rough
upon
us
in
vain
i
assured
him
i
was
not
at
all
glad
to
go
very
very
sorry
in
fact
all
he
would
say
was
to
england
home
and
beauty
in
course
any
one
would
be
pleased
to
return
i
ca
tell
you
what
he
meant
and
he
had
no
voice
to
waste
on
explanations
i
only
give
poor
dear
jim
valedictory
sentences
as
they
fell
from
his
white
and
trembling
lips
very
different
was
ned
palmer
the
most
diminutive
and
wiry
of
hill
shepherds
with
a
tongue
which
seemed
never
tired
and
a
good
humoured
smile
for
every
one
ned
used
to
try
my
gravity
sorely
by
stepping
up
to
me
half
a
dozen
times
during
the
service
to
find
his
place
for
him
in
his
and
always
saying
aloud
thank
you
kindly
m
chapter
ix
another
shepherd
hut
to
get
to
ned
hut
which
was
not
nearly
so
trim
or
comfortable
as
salter
and
stood
out
in
the
midst
of
a
vast
plain
covered
with
waving
yellow
tussocks
we
had
to
cross
a
low
range
of
hills
and
pick
our
way
through
nearly
a
mile
of
swampy
ground
on
the
other
side
the
horses
their
way
up
the
steep
with
astonishing
ease
availing
themselves
here
and
there
of
a
sheep
track
for
sheep
are
the
best
engineers
in
the
world
and
always
hit
off
the
safest
and
easiest
line
of
country
i
did
not
feel
nervous
going
the
hill
although
we
must
have
appeared
had
there
been
any
one
to
look
at
us
more
like
flies
on
a
wall
than
a
couple
of
people
on
horse
back
but
when
we
came
to
the
ridge
and
looked
down
on
the
descent
beneath
us
my
heart
fairly
gave
way
not
a
blade
of
grass
or
a
leaf
of
a
shrub
was
to
be
seen
on
all
the
steep
slope
or
rather
precipice
for
there
was
very
little
slope
about
it
nothing
but
grey
loose
shingle
which
the
first
of
the
leading
horse
invariably
sent
slipping
and
sliding
in
a
perfect
avalanche
of
rubble
down
into
the
soft
bright
green
morass
beneath
of
all
the
bad
tracks
i
encountered
in
my
primitive
rides
i
really
believe
i
suffered
more
real
terror
and
anguish
on
that
particular
than
on
any
other
my
companion
conduct
too
used
to
be
heartless
in
the
extreme
he
let
the
reins
fall
loosely
on
his
neck
merely
holding
their
extreme
ends
settled
himself
comfortably
in
his
saddle
leaning
well
back
and
turning
round
laughingly
to
me
observed
are
you
coming
oh
not
there
i
cried
in
true
tones
of
horror
but
it
was
all
in
vain
f
merely
remarked
you
have
nothing
to
do
but
fancy
you
are
sitting
in
an
at
home
you
are
quite
as
safe
what
nonsense
i
gasped
i
only
wish
i
at
home
never
never
will
i
come
out
riding
again
all
this
time
the
leading
horse
was
slowly
and
carefully
edging
himself
down
hill
a
few
steps
to
the
right
then
a
few
to
the
left
just
as
he
thought
best
displacing
tons
of
loose
stone
and
even
small
rocks
at
every
movement
helen
nothing
daunted
was
eager
to
follow
and
although
she
quivered
with
excitement
at
the
noise
echoed
back
from
the
opposite
hills
lost
no
time
in
preparing
to
descend
her
first
movement
sent
such
showers
of
rubble
down
upon
f
and
his
horse
that
i
really
thought
the
latter
would
have
been
knocked
off
his
legs
if
you
keep
a
little
more
to
the
right
so
as
to
send
the
stones
clear
of
me
i
should
be
very
grateful
shouted
f
who
was
actually
near
the
bottom
of
the
hill
already
so
sharp
had
been
the
angles
of
his
descent
i
felt
afraid
of
attempting
to
guide
helen
lest
the
least
check
should
send
us
both
head
over
heels
into
the
quagmire
below
and
yet
it
seemed
dreadful
to
cause
the
death
of
one
husband
by
rolling
down
cart
loads
of
stones
upon
him
it
could
not
have
been
more
than
five
minutes
before
helen
and
i
stood
side
by
side
with
leo
on
the
only
bit
of
firm
ground
at
the
edge
of
the
morass
i
believe
i
was
as
white
as
my
pocket
handkerchief
and
if
fright
could
turn
a
person
hair
grey
i
had
been
sufficiently
alarmed
to
make
myself
eligible
for
any
quantity
of
walnut
pomade
fortunately
the
summer
had
proved
rather
a
dry
one
and
the
swamp
was
not
so
wet
as
it
would
have
been
after
a
heavy
the
horses
stepped
carefully
from
flax
bushes
to
nigger
heads
as
the
very
old
blackened
grass
stumps
are
called
resting
hardly
a
moment
anywhere
and
avoiding
all
the
most
seductive
looking
spots
i
thought
my
companion
must
have
gone
suddenly
mad
when
a
hawk
rising
up
almost
from
beneath
our
horses
feet
he
flung
himself
off
his
saddle
and
cried
out
a
late
hawk
nest
i
declare
and
so
it
proved
for
a
little
searching
in
a
sheltered
and
tolerably
dry
spot
revealed
a
couple
of
eggs
precisely
like
hens
eggs
until
broken
when
their
delicate
pale
green
inner
membrane
betrayed
their
dangerous
origin
it
is
chiefly
owing
to
this
practice
of
laying
in
swamps
that
the
various
kinds
of
hawk
increase
and
thrive
as
they
do
for
if
it
were
possible
to
get
at
them
the
shepherds
would
soon
exterminate
the
sworn
foe
of
their
chickens
and
pigeons
they
are
also
the
great
drawback
to
the
introduction
of
pheasants
and
partridges
for
the
young
birds
have
not
a
chance
in
the
open
against
even
a
although
it
is
a
digression
i
must
tell
you
here
how
one
beautiful
early
winter
day
i
was
standing
in
the
verandah
at
my
own
home
when
one
of
our
pigeons
chased
by
a
hawk
flew
right
into
my
face
and
its
pursuer
was
so
close
and
so
heated
by
the
chase
that
it
flung
itself
also
with
great
violence
against
my
head
with
a
scream
of
rage
and
triumph
hurting
me
a
good
deal
as
it
dug
its
cruel
armed
heel
into
my
cheek
the
pigeon
had
fluttered
stunned
and
exhausted
to
the
ground
and
quick
as
lightning
i
stooped
to
pick
it
up
so
great
had
been
the
impetus
of
the
hawk
final
charge
that
he
had
never
perceived
his
victim
had
escaped
him
the
cunning
of
these
birds
must
be
seen
to
be
believed
i
have
often
watched
a
wary
old
hawk
perched
most
impudently
on
the
rails
waiting
until
a
rash
chicken
or
duckling
should
in
spite
of
its
mother
warning
clucks
of
terror
insist
on
coming
out
from
under
her
sheltering
wings
if
i
took
an
umbrella
or
a
croquet
mallet
or
a
walking
stick
and
went
out
the
bird
would
remain
quite
unmoved
even
if
i
held
my
weapon
pointed
towards
him
but
let
anyone
take
a
real
gun
and
hold
it
ever
so
well
hidden
behind
their
back
and
emerge
ever
so
cautiously
from
the
shelter
of
the
shrubs
my
fine
gentleman
was
off
directly
mounting
out
of
sight
with
a
few
strokes
of
his
powerful
wings
and
uttering
a
shriek
of
derision
as
he
departed
nothing
is
so
rare
as
a
successful
shot
at
a
hawk
we
consoled
ourselves
however
on
this
occasion
by
reflecting
that
we
had
annihilated
two
young
hawks
before
they
had
commenced
their
lives
of
rapine
and
robbery
and
rode
on
our
way
rejoicing
to
find
ned
palmer
sitting
outside
his
but
door
on
a
log
of
drift
wood
making
candles
in
the
more
primitive
days
of
the
settlement
the
early
settlers
must
have
been
as
badly
off
for
light
during
the
long
dark
winter
evenings
as
are
even
now
the
poorer
inhabitants
of
greenland
or
of
iceland
for
their
sole
substitute
for
candles
consisted
of
a
pannikin
half
filled
with
melted
tallow
in
which
a
piece
of
cork
and
an
apology
for
a
wick
floated
but
by
my
time
all
this
had
long
been
past
and
over
and
even
a
shepherd
had
a
nice
tin
mould
in
which
he
could
make
a
dozen
candles
of
the
purest
tallow
at
a
time
ned
was
just
running
a
slender
piece
of
wood
through
the
loops
of
his
twisted
cotton
wicks
so
as
to
keep
them
above
the
rim
of
the
mould
and
the
strong
odour
of
melted
mutton
fat
was
tainting
the
lovely
fresh
air
but
new
zealand
have
often
to
put
up
with
queer
smells
as
well
as
sights
and
sounds
therefore
we
only
complimented
ned
on
being
provident
enough
to
make
a
good
stock
of
candles
for
home
consumption
during
the
coming
dark
days
after
we
had
dismounted
and
hobbled
our
horses
with
the
stirrup
leathers
so
that
they
could
move
about
and
nibble
the
sweet
blue
grass
growing
under
each
sheltering
tussock
i
sat
down
on
a
large
stone
near
and
began
to
tell
ned
how
often
i
had
watched
the
negroes
in
jamaica
making
candles
after
a
similar
fashion
only
they
use
the
wax
from
the
wild
bee
nests
instead
of
tallow
which
was
a
rare
and
scarce
thing
in
that
part
of
the
world
i
described
to
him
the
thick
wax
candles
which
used
to
be
the
delight
of
my
childhood
giving
out
a
peculiar
perfuming
odour
after
they
had
been
burning
for
an
hour
or
two
an
odour
made
up
of
honey
and
the
scent
of
heavy
tropic
flowers
ned
listened
to
my
little
story
with
much
politeness
and
then
feeling
it
incumbent
on
him
to
contribute
to
the
conversation
remarked
i
never
makes
candles
without
i
thinks
of
how
is
that
palmer
i
asked
laughingly
what
in
the
world
have
they
to
do
with
each
other
well
you
see
it
was
just
in
this
way
it
was
afore
i
come
here
which
is
quite
a
lively
sociable
place
compared
to
dodson
back
country
at
the
foot
o
those
there
ranges
beyond
i
give
you
my
word
it
used
always
to
make
me
feel
as
if
i
was
dead
and
living
in
a
lonely
eternity
them
clear
glaciers
he
meant
i
presume
was
awful
lonesome
and
as
for
a
human
being
they
never
come
the
place
well
as
i
was
saying
one
day
i
finds
i
had
run
out
o
candles
and
as
the
long
dark
evenings
for
it
was
the
height
o
winter
was
bad
enough
even
with
a
dip
burning
to
show
me
old
spot
face
for
company
i
set
to
work
hot
haste
to
make
some
more
it
was
bitter
biting
cold
you
bet
and
i
was
hard
at
work
just
after
i
had
had
my
bit
o
breakfast
before
i
went
out
for
to
look
round
my
boundary
melting
and
making
my
dips
so
that
they
might
be
fine
and
hard
for
night
i
ought
praps
to
mention
that
spot
used
to
get
so
close
to
the
that
as
often
as
not
i
dropped
a
mossel
of
the
hot
grease
on
the
dog
and
if
it
touched
a
thin
place
in
his
coat
he
would
jump
up
howling
well
i
was
pouring
a
pannikin
full
o
biling
tallow
into
the
mould
when
poor
old
spot
he
gives
a
sudden
howl
and
yell
and
runs
to
the
door
i
paid
no
attention
to
him
at
the
time
for
i
was
so
busy
but
he
went
on
leaping
up
and
howling
as
if
he
had
gone
mad
as
soon
as
i
could
put
down
the
pannikin
out
my
hand
i
went
to
the
door
meaning
to
open
it
and
sorry
am
i
to
say
it
kick
the
poor
beast
out
for
making
such
a
row
about
a
drop
o
hot
grease
but
the
dog
turned
his
face
round
on
me
and
gave
me
a
look
as
much
as
to
say
haste
do
there
a
good
chap
i
ought
to
be
outside
there
and
what
with
the
sense
shinin
in
his
eyes
and
a
curious
kind
o
sound
outside
i
takes
down
the
bar
for
the
door
would
stay
shut
otherwise
and
looks
out
never
until
my
dyin
day
and
not
even
then
i
expect
shall
i
forget
what
the
dog
and
i
saw
lying
on
the
ground
which
was
all
white
and
hard
with
frost
the
sun
not
having
got
over
the
east
range
yet
the
dog
he
had
more
sense
and
a
deal
more
pluck
than
i
had
for
he
knows
there
aint
a
moment
to
be
lost
and
he
runs
up
to
the
flat
heap
o
clothes
gets
on
its
back
for
no
face
could
i
see
so
as
to
be
doing
something
and
not
losing
time
and
begins
licking
not
very
far
off
there
was
a
lean
horse
standing
but
he
did
seem
to
like
to
come
through
the
the
paddock
fence
in
coorse
i
could
stand
gaping
there
all
day
so
i
went
and
stooped
down
to
the
man
who
was
lying
flat
on
his
face
with
his
arms
straight
out
he
was
sensibleless
palmer
favourite
word
for
senseless
for
he
opened
his
eyes
and
said
for
god
sake
mate
take
me
in
so
i
will
mate
i
makes
reply
and
welcome
you
are
can
you
get
on
your
legs
think
you
with
that
he
groans
awful
and
says
my
legs
is
friz
well
i
looks
at
his
legs
and
sees
he
was
dressed
in
what
had
been
good
moleskins
and
high
jack
coming
up
to
his
knees
but
sure
enough
they
was
as
hard
as
a
board
and
actially
if
believe
me
there
was
a
rim
o
solid
hice
round
the
tops
of
his
boots
as
for
standing
he
could
do
it
his
legs
was
no
more
use
to
him
than
they
was
to
me
and
he
was
a
tall
high
fellow
besides
cold
as
it
was
i
felt
hot
enough
by
the
time
i
had
lugged
that
poor
man
inside
my
place
and
got
him
up
on
my
bunk
he
could
speak
though
his
voice
was
weak
as
weak
could
be
and
he
helped
me
as
well
as
he
could
by
catching
hold
with
his
arms
but
his
legs
was
stone
dead
i
had
to
get
the
tommy
and
his
boots
off
and
that
the
gospel
truth
i
broke
my
knife
first
try
and
the
axe
was
too
big
he
told
me
poor
fellow
that
two
days
before
as
he
was
returning
from
prospecting
up
towards
the
back
ranges
his
horse
got
away
and
he
catch
him
no
he
tried
with
all
his
might
and
main
for
in
his
swag
which
was
strapped
to
the
d
of
his
saddle
was
not
only
his
blanket
but
his
baccy
and
tea
and
damper
and
a
glass
o
grog
the
curious
thing
too
was
that
the
horse
did
bolt
right
away
as
they
generally
do
he
jest
walked
knowing
his
master
was
bound
to
follow
wherever
he
led
for
in
coorse
he
had
hopes
to
catch
him
every
moment
that
ere
brute
he
never
laid
down
nor
rested
jest
kep
slowly
moving
on
as
if
he
was
a
lunnon
with
a
bobby
at
his
heels
through
creeks
and
rivers
and
swamps
he
led
that
poor
fellow
his
boots
got
chuck
full
o
cold
water
and
when
the
sun
went
down
it
friz
into
solid
hice
and
that
misfortnit
man
he
felt
his
legs
which
was
his
life
you
see
gradially
dyin
under
him
yet
he
was
a
one
if
ever
there
was
such
a
party
on
this
airth
he
told
me
he
had
took
mortial
hours
to
come
the
last
mile
the
horse
walkin
slowly
afore
him
and
guiding
him
like
and
how
do
you
think
he
did
it
with
two
pillars
of
hice
for
legs
why
he
lifted
up
just
one
leg
and
then
the
other
with
both
his
hands
and
put
them
afore
him
and
took
his
steps
that
way
here
honest
ned
his
eyes
glistening
and
his
ugly
little
face
glowing
with
emotion
through
its
coating
of
sunburn
paused
as
if
he
did
not
like
to
go
on
i
was
more
touched
and
interested
than
i
could
avoid
showing
and
cried
oh
tell
me
palmer
what
became
of
the
poor
fellow
did
he
die
ned
cleared
his
throat
and
moved
so
as
to
get
between
me
and
the
light
from
the
door
as
he
said
huskily
he
came
very
nigh
to
it
i
never
did
set
eyes
on
such
a
decent
patient
chap
as
that
man
was
i
did
the
very
wust
thing
i
could
a
done
the
town
doctors
told
me
for
i
brought
him
into
the
hut
instead
o
keeping
him
outdoors
and
rubbing
his
poor
black
legs
with
snow
o
that
i
wrapped
him
up
warm
in
my
own
blankets
after
i
had
chipped
his
boots
and
the
hice
off
of
and
i
made
up
a
roarin
fire
good
lord
how
the
poor
fellow
groaned
when
he
begun
to
get
warm
i
gave
him
a
pannikin
full
o
hot
tea
with
a
drop
o
grog
in
it
and
that
seemed
to
make
him
awful
bad
at
last
he
said
with
the
sweat
from
sheer
agony
pouring
down
his
face
look
here
matey
could
you
hump
me
out
in
the
snow
again
for
it
aint
nigh
so
bad
to
bear
it
cold
as
it
is
to
bear
it
hot
not
a
bad
word
did
he
say
and
he
tried
not
to
give
in
more
nor
he
could
help
but
he
was
clean
druv
wild
with
the
hanguish
in
his
legs
presently
i
remembers
quite
sudden
like
that
a
bush
doctor
name
of
tomkins
was
likely
to
be
round
by
simmons
cos
o
his
missus
so
i
got
on
my
in
a
minnit
and
i
rides
off
and
fetches
him
for
sure
enough
he
was
there
and
though
simmons
missis
was
to
say
over
her
troubles
she
spoke
up
from
behind
the
curtain
of
red
blanket
she
had
put
up
in
her
tidy
little
hut
and
bade
old
tomkins
go
with
me
may
god
bless
her
and
hers
for
that
same
say
i
well
when
tomkins
come
back
with
me
and
saw
the
poor
fellow
he
was
fair
shoutin
with
the
pain
in
his
legs
by
then
he
said
nothin
could
be
done
they
mortify
by
morrow
mornin
says
he
and
then
he
die
easy
so
with
that
he
goes
back
with
the
first
light
next
day
to
simmons
sure
enough
the
poor
fellow
did
get
a
bit
easier
next
day
and
i
felt
clear
mad
to
think
he
was
goin
to
die
before
my
very
eyes
not
if
i
can
help
it
i
cries
quite
savage
like
but
he
only
smiled
a
patient
smile
and
said
god
will
be
done
mate
he
knows
best
and
i
aint
in
any
pain
to
speak
of
now
by
and
bye
i
hears
a
rumbling
and
a
creaking
and
cracking
of
whips
and
when
i
looks
out
what
do
i
see
but
the
from
coming
up
the
flat
it
was
the
only
thing
on
wheels
within
forty
mile
and
simmons
had
brought
it
his
own
self
to
see
if
we
could
manage
to
get
the
poor
fellow
down
to
the
nighest
town
i
wo
make
my
yarn
no
longer
than
i
can
help
so
i
only
mention
that
we
made
a
lot
o
the
strongest
mutton
broth
you
ever
tasted
we
slung
a
hammock
of
red
blankets
in
the
dray
and
we
got
the
poor
fellow
down
by
evening
to
a
gentleman
station
there
they
made
us
kindly
welcome
did
all
they
could
for
him
and
transhipped
the
hammock
into
a
dray
which
went
quicker
and
was
easier
we
got
on
as
fast
as
we
could
every
step
of
the
way
and
by
midnight
that
poor
fellow
was
tucked
into
a
clean
bed
in
the
hospital
at
christchurch
with
both
his
legs
neatly
cut
off
just
above
the
knee
for
there
was
a
minute
to
lose
i
was
almost
afraid
to
inquire
how
the
sufferer
fared
for
ned
eyes
were
fairly
swimming
with
unshed
tears
but
he
smiled
brightly
and
said
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
in
the
town
they
set
up
a
and
bought
the
poor
chap
a
pair
o
wooden
legs
and
he
could
even
manage
to
ride
about
after
a
bit
and
instead
o
wandering
about
looking
for
country
or
gold
or
what
not
he
settled
down
as
a
carrier
and
throve
and
did
well
and
i
was
thinking
as
how
i
like
to
return
thanks
for
that
poor
fellow
wonderful
recovery
for
i
never
had
a
chance
of
going
to
church
since
and
its
nigh
upon
two
years
ago
that
it
happened
so
you
shall
ned
so
you
shall
we
said
with
one
voice
and
so
at
our
first
church
gathering
at
our
dear
little
antipodean
home
f
who
acted
as
our
minister
paused
in
the
beautiful
thanksgiving
service
after
he
had
read
solemnly
and
slowly
the
simple
words
especially
for
thy
late
mercies
vouchsafed
to
and
ned
palmer
chimed
in
with
an
amen
misplaced
indeed
but
none
the
less
hearty
and
delightful
to
hear
chapter
x
swaggers
johnson
did
not
know
the
somewhat
vulgar
word
which
heads
this
paper
at
least
he
did
not
know
it
as
a
noun
but
gives
swagger
to
bluster
bully
brag
but
the
slang
dictionary
admits
it
as
a
word
springing
indeed
from
the
thieves
vocabulary
one
who
carries
a
swag
neither
of
these
books
however
give
the
least
idea
of
the
true
meaning
of
the
expression
which
is
as
fully
recognised
as
an
honest
word
in
both
australia
and
new
zealand
as
any
other
combination
of
letters
in
the
english
language
a
swagger
is
the
very
antithesis
then
of
a
swaggerer
for
whereas
the
one
is
full
of
pretension
and
abounds
in
unjust
claims
on
our
notice
the
swagger
is
humility
and
civility
itself
he
knows
poor
weary
tramp
that
on
the
favourable
impression
he
makes
upon
the
boss
depends
his
night
lodging
and
food
as
well
as
a
job
of
work
in
the
future
we
will
leave
then
the
ideal
swaggerer
to
some
other
biographer
who
may
draw
glowing
of
him
in
all
his
jay
splendour
and
we
will
confine
ourselves
to
describing
the
real
swagger
clad
in
flannel
shirt
moleskin
trowsers
and
what
were
once
thick
boots
but
might
now
be
used
as
sieves
nothing
astonished
me
so
much
in
my
new
zealand
station
life
as
these
visitors
even
sir
roger
de
coverley
himself
would
have
looked
with
distrust
upon
most
of
our
and
yet
i
never
heard
of
an
instance
in
our
part
of
the
country
where
the
unhesitating
ungrudging
hospitality
extended
by
the
rich
squatters
to
their
poorer
compatriots
was
ever
abused
i
say
in
our
part
because
unfortunately
wherever
gold
is
discovered
either
in
quartz
or
riverbed
the
good
old
primitive
customs
and
ways
die
out
of
themselves
in
a
few
weeks
and
each
looks
with
distrust
on
a
stranger
only
fifty
or
sixty
miles
from
us
as
the
crow
might
fly
across
the
snowy
range
where
an
immense
bush
clothes
the
banks
of
the
hokitika
river
right
down
to
its
mouth
on
the
west
coast
the
great
gold
diggings
broke
out
seven
or
eight
years
ago
and
changed
the
face
of
society
in
that
district
in
a
few
days
a
swagger
meant
a
man
who
might
rob
or
murder
you
in
your
sleep
after
you
had
fed
and
lodged
him
or
under
the
most
favourable
circumstances
supposing
him
to
be
a
milder
mannered
man
a
fossicker
who
would
not
hesitate
to
jump
your
claim
or
hang
about
when
you
are
prospecting
to
watch
how
much
of
the
colour
you
found
and
then
go
off
stealthily
to
return
next
day
at
the
head
of
a
rush
of
a
thousand
diggers
even
before
the
famous
maungatapu
murders
in
swaggers
were
looked
upon
with
distrust
on
the
west
coast
and
after
that
date
hardly
any
one
travelled
in
those
parts
without
carrying
a
small
revolver
in
his
nothing
is
more
tantalising
than
an
allusion
to
a
circumstance
which
is
not
and
as
i
feel
certain
that
very
few
of
my
readers
have
ever
heard
of
what
may
be
called
the
first
great
crime
committed
in
the
middle
island
a
brief
account
of
that
terrible
tragedy
may
not
be
out
of
place
gold
of
course
was
at
the
bottom
of
it
but
the
full
of
the
glittering
flakes
were
red
with
blood
by
the
time
they
reached
the
bank
at
nelson
the
diggings
on
the
west
coast
were
only
two
years
old
at
that
date
and
although
it
was
not
uncommon
for
prospecting
parties
cutting
their
way
axe
in
hand
through
the
thick
bush
to
come
upon
skeletons
of
men
in
lonely
places
still
it
might
be
taken
for
granted
that
these
were
the
remains
of
early
explorers
or
travellers
who
had
got
lost
and
starved
to
death
within
the
green
tangled
walls
of
this
impenetrable
forest
the
scenery
of
that
part
of
the
middle
island
is
far
more
beautiful
than
in
the
agricultural
or
pastoral
districts
giant
alps
clothed
half
up
their
steep
sides
with
evergreen
pines
whose
dark
forms
end
abruptly
where
snow
and
ice
begin
stand
out
against
a
pure
sky
of
more
than
italian
blue
and
only
when
a
cleared
saddle
is
reached
can
the
traveller
look
down
over
the
wooded
hills
and
vallies
rolling
away
inland
before
him
or
turn
his
eyes
to
the
bold
coast
with
its
many
rivers
whose
wide
mouths
foam
right
out
to
where
the
great
pacific
waves
are
heaving
under
the
bright
winter
sun
such
and
yet
still
more
fair
must
have
been
the
prospect
on
which
burgess
kelly
levy
and
sullivan
eyes
rested
one
june
morning
in
the
of
they
were
one
and
all
originally
london
thieves
and
had
been
transported
years
before
to
the
early
penal
settlements
of
australia
from
thence
they
had
managed
by
fair
means
and
foul
to
work
their
way
to
other
places
and
had
latterly
been
living
in
the
middle
island
earning
what
they
could
by
and
divers
odd
jobs
but
your
true
convict
hates
work
with
a
curiously
deadly
hatred
and
these
four
men
agreed
to
go
and
look
round
them
at
the
new
west
coast
diggings
they
found
however
that
there
as
elsewhere
it
would
be
necessary
to
work
hard
so
in
disgust
at
seeing
the
nuggets
and
dust
which
rewarded
the
toil
of
more
industrious
men
they
left
hokitika
and
reached
nelson
on
their
way
to
picton
the
chief
town
of
the
adjoining
province
of
marlborough
most
of
the
gold
found
its
way
under
a
strongly
armed
escort
to
the
banks
in
both
these
towns
but
it
was
that
fortunate
diggers
occasionally
travelled
together
unarmed
and
laden
with
dust
so
safe
had
been
the
roads
hitherto
that
the
commonest
precautions
were
not
taken
nor
the
least
secrecy
observed
about
travellers
movements
it
was
therefore
no
mystery
that
four
unarmed
diggers
carrying
a
considerable
number
of
ounces
of
with
them
were
going
to
start
from
the
diggings
for
nelson
on
a
certain
day
and
the
men
i
have
mentioned
set
out
to
meet
them
one
part
of
their
long
journey
led
them
over
the
maungatapu
range
by
a
saddle
which
in
its
lowest
part
is
feet
above
the
the
night
before
the
murder
the
victims
and
their
assassins
camped
out
with
only
ten
miles
between
them
so
lonely
and
deserted
was
the
rough
mountain
track
that
the
appearance
of
a
poor
old
man
named
battle
alarmed
burgess
and
his
gang
dreadfully
and
they
immediately
murdered
him
in
order
that
he
should
not
report
having
passed
them
on
the
road
between
the
commission
of
this
act
of
precaution
and
the
arrival
of
the
little
band
of
travellers
no
one
else
was
seen
burgess
appears
to
have
shown
some
of
the
qualities
of
a
good
general
for
he
selected
a
spot
where
the
only
path
wound
along
a
steep
less
than
six
feet
wide
with
an
unbroken
forest
on
the
upper
and
a
mass
of
tangled
bush
on
the
lower
side
as
the
doomed
men
approached
the
murderers
sprang
out
and
each
thrusting
a
revolver
close
to
their
faces
called
on
them
to
hold
up
their
hands
this
is
an
old
bushranger
challenge
and
is
meant
to
ensure
perfect
quiescence
on
the
part
of
the
victim
the
travellers
mechanically
complied
and
in
this
way
were
instantly
separated
led
to
different
spots
and
ruthlessly
shot
dead
it
was
all
over
in
a
moment
burgess
and
his
men
flung
the
bodies
down
among
the
tangled
bush
and
returned
to
nelson
rejoicing
exceedingly
over
the
simple
and
easy
means
by
which
they
had
possessed
themselves
of
several
hundred
pounds
of
course
they
calculated
on
the
usual
supine
indifference
to
other
people
affairs
which
prevails
in
busy
communities
but
in
this
instance
the
public
seemed
to
be
suddenly
seized
by
a
violent
and
inconvenient
curiosity
to
find
out
what
had
become
of
the
four
men
who
were
known
to
have
started
from
two
or
three
days
before
no
one
ever
dreamed
of
a
murder
having
been
committed
not
even
when
another
swagger
reached
nelson
and
stated
that
he
had
followed
the
diggers
on
the
road
only
a
mile
or
so
behind
had
suddenly
lost
sight
of
them
at
the
spot
i
have
mentioned
and
had
never
been
able
to
overtake
them
instead
of
leaving
the
now
excited
little
town
or
keeping
quiet
burgess
kelly
levy
and
sullivan
may
truly
be
said
to
have
become
swaggerers
for
they
loitered
about
the
place
ostentatiously
displaying
their
bags
of
gold
dust
unsuspicious
as
the
nelson
people
were
they
acted
upon
a
sort
of
instinct
that
instinct
within
us
which
answers
so
mysteriously
to
the
cry
of
blood
from
the
earth
and
arrested
these
four
men
still
the
matter
might
have
ended
there
for
lack
of
a
clue
if
one
of
the
party
sullivan
had
not
suddenly
turned
informer
and
led
the
horrified
to
the
jungle
which
concealed
the
bodies
here
my
dreadful
story
may
end
for
we
need
not
follow
the
course
of
the
trial
which
resulted
in
the
complete
conviction
of
the
three
other
men
i
have
only
dwelt
on
so
horrible
a
theme
in
order
to
make
my
readers
understand
how
natural
it
was
that
i
should
feel
nervous
when
it
became
apparent
to
my
understanding
that
the
custom
of
the
country
demanded
that
you
should
ask
no
questions
but
simply
tell
any
travellers
who
claimed
your
hospitality
where
they
were
to
sleep
and
send
them
in
large
supplies
of
mutton
flour
and
tea
on
one
occasion
it
chanced
that
f
our
stalwart
cadet
a
and
the
man
who
did
odd
jobs
about
the
place
were
all
on
the
point
of
setting
out
upon
some
expedition
when
a
party
of
four
swaggers
made
their
appearance
just
at
sundown
no
true
swagger
ever
appears
earlier
lest
he
might
be
politely
requested
to
move
on
to
the
next
station
whereas
if
he
times
his
arrival
exactly
when
the
shades
of
night
are
falling
fast
no
boss
could
be
enough
to
point
to
hills
and
valleys
which
are
a
of
deep
creeks
and
swamps
and
desire
the
wayfarer
to
go
on
further
once
and
only
once
did
i
know
of
such
a
thing
being
done
but
i
will
not
say
more
about
that
unfortunate
at
this
moment
for
i
want
to
claim
the
pity
of
all
my
lady
readers
for
the
very
unprotected
position
i
am
trying
to
depict
f
could
not
understand
my
nervousness
and
did
not
reassure
me
by
saying
as
he
mounted
his
horse
i
told
them
to
sleep
in
the
stable
i
am
pretty
sure
they
are
sailors
they
seem
so
footsore
do
expect
me
until
you
see
me
now
i
was
a
very
new
chum
in
those
days
and
had
just
heard
of
the
maungatapu
murders
these
guests
of
mine
looked
most
disreputable
and
were
all
powerful
young
men
i
do
not
believe
there
was
a
single
lock
or
bolt
or
bar
on
any
door
in
the
whole
of
the
little
wooden
house
the
large
stood
outside
in
the
verandah
and
my
could
have
been
carried
off
through
the
bedroom
window
by
an
enterprising
thief
of
ten
years
old
as
for
my
two
maids
the
only
human
beings
within
reach
they
were
as
perfectly
useless
on
any
emergency
as
if
they
had
been
wax
dolls
one
of
them
had
the
habit
of
fainting
if
anything
happened
and
the
other
used
to
tend
her
until
she
revived
when
they
both
sat
still
and
shrieked
their
nerves
had
once
been
tested
by
a
carpenter
who
was
employed
about
the
house
and
cut
his
hand
badly
on
another
occasion
by
the
kitchen
chimney
which
took
fire
and
that
was
the
way
they
behaved
each
time
so
it
was
useless
to
look
upon
their
presence
as
any
safeguard
indeed
one
of
them
speedily
detected
a
fancied
likeness
to
burgess
in
one
of
the
poor
swaggers
and
shrieked
every
time
she
saw
him
we
were
indeed
three
lone
women
all
through
that
weary
night
i
could
not
close
my
eyes
but
laid
awake
listening
to
the
weka
shrill
call
or
the
melancholy
cry
of
the
bitterns
down
in
the
swamp
with
the
morning
light
came
hope
and
courage
and
i
must
say
i
felt
ashamed
of
my
suspicions
when
my
cook
came
to
announce
that
the
swaggers
was
just
agoin
off
and
wishful
to
say
they
been
and
washed
up
the
tin
plates
and
pannikins
and
spoons
as
clean
as
clean
can
be
and
the
one
i
thought
favoured
burgess
so
much
mum
he
been
and
draw
water
from
the
well
all
that
we
shall
want
and
they
very
civil
chaps
if
you
please
mum
f
was
right
in
his
surmise
i
fancy
for
there
were
plenty
of
tattooed
pictures
of
anchors
and
ships
on
the
brawny
bare
arms
of
my
departing
guests
they
seemed
much
disappointed
to
find
there
was
no
work
to
be
had
on
our
station
but
departed
with
many
thanks
and
blessings
over
the
hills
and
far
away
latterly
with
increasing
civilization
and
corresponding
social
economy
there
have
been
many
attempts
made
by
managers
of
runs
more
than
by
the
themselves
to
induce
these
swaggers
to
work
for
their
tucker
to
use
pure
colonial
phraseology
several
devices
have
been
tried
such
as
taking
away
their
swags
their
red
blankets
rolled
tightly
into
a
sort
of
pack
which
they
carry
on
their
backs
and
derive
their
name
from
and
locking
them
up
until
they
had
chopped
a
small
quantity
of
wood
or
performed
some
other
trifling
domestic
duty
but
the
swagger
will
be
led
though
not
driven
and
what
he
often
did
of
his
own
accord
for
the
sake
of
a
nod
or
a
smile
of
thanks
from
my
pretty
he
would
not
do
for
the
hardest
words
which
ever
came
out
of
a
boss
mouth
there
are
also
strict
rules
of
honesty
observed
among
these
men
and
if
one
swagger
were
to
purloin
the
smallest
article
from
a
station
which
had
fed
and
sheltered
him
every
other
swagger
in
all
the
country
side
would
immediately
become
an
amateur
detective
to
make
the
thief
give
up
his
spoil
a
pair
of
old
boots
was
once
missing
from
a
neighbouring
station
and
suspicion
fell
upon
a
swagger
justice
was
perhaps
somewhat
tardy
in
this
instance
as
it
rested
entirely
in
the
hands
of
every
tramp
who
passed
that
way
but
at
the
end
of
some
months
the
boots
were
found
at
home
and
the
innocence
of
the
swaggers
individually
and
collectively
triumphantly
established
the
only
instance
of
harshness
to
a
swagger
which
came
under
my
notice
during
three
years
residence
in
new
zealand
is
the
one
i
have
alluded
to
above
and
contains
so
much
dramatic
interest
in
its
details
that
it
may
not
be
out
of
place
here
although
i
have
naturally
dwelt
in
these
papers
more
upon
our
bright
sunny
weather
our
clear
bracing
winter
days
and
our
balmy
spring
and
autumn
evenings
let
no
intending
traveller
think
that
he
will
not
meet
with
bad
weather
at
the
antipodes
i
can
only
repeat
what
i
have
said
with
pen
and
voice
a
hundred
times
before
new
zealand
possesses
a
very
capricious
and
disagreeable
climate
disagreeable
from
its
constant
high
winds
but
it
is
perhaps
the
most
singularly
and
remarkably
healthy
place
in
the
world
this
must
surely
arise
from
the
very
gales
which
i
found
so
trying
to
my
temper
for
damp
is
a
word
without
meaning
as
for
mildew
or
miasma
the
generation
who
are
growing
up
there
will
not
know
the
meaning
of
the
words
and
in
spite
of
a
warm
bright
day
often
turning
at
five
minutes
warning
into
a
snowy
or
wet
afternoon
colds
and
coughs
are
almost
unknown
people
who
go
out
there
with
delicate
lungs
recover
in
the
most
surprising
manner
surprising
because
one
expects
the
sudden
changes
of
temperature
the
unavoidable
exposure
to
rain
and
even
snow
to
kill
instead
of
curing
invalids
but
the
practice
is
very
unlike
the
theory
in
this
case
and
people
thrive
where
they
ought
to
die
during
my
first
winter
in
canterbury
we
had
only
one
week
of
bad
weather
but
i
felt
at
that
time
as
if
i
had
never
realized
before
what
bad
weather
meant
a
true
was
blowing
from
the
first
to
the
second
monday
in
that
july
without
one
moment
lull
the
bitter
furious
blast
swept
down
the
mountain
gorges
driving
sheets
of
blinding
rain
in
a
dense
wall
before
it
now
and
then
the
rain
turned
into
large
or
the
wind
rose
into
such
a
hurricane
that
the
falling
water
appeared
to
be
flashing
over
the
drenched
earth
without
actually
touching
it
indoors
we
could
hardly
hear
ourselves
speak
for
the
noise
of
the
wind
and
rain
against
the
shingle
roof
it
became
a
service
of
danger
almost
resembling
a
forlorn
hope
to
go
out
and
drag
in
logs
of
wet
wood
or
draw
water
from
the
well
for
alas
there
were
no
convenient
taps
or
snug
in
our
little
wooden
house
we
husbanded
every
scrap
of
mutton
in
very
different
fashion
to
our
usual
reckless
consumption
the
consumption
of
a
household
which
has
no
butcher
bill
to
pay
for
we
knew
not
when
the
shepherd
might
be
able
to
fight
his
way
through
the
storm
with
half
a
sheep
packed
before
him
on
sturdy
little
judy
back
the
creeks
rose
and
poured
over
their
banks
in
angry
yellow
floods
every
morning
casualties
in
the
poultry
yard
had
to
be
reported
and
that
week
cost
me
almost
as
many
fowls
and
ducks
as
my
great
christening
party
did
the
first
thing
every
morning
when
i
opened
my
eyes
i
used
to
jump
up
and
look
out
of
the
different
windows
with
eager
curiosity
to
see
if
there
were
any
signs
of
a
break
in
the
weather
for
i
was
quite
unaccustomed
to
be
pent
up
like
a
besieged
prisoner
for
so
many
succeeding
days
we
did
not
boast
of
shutters
in
those
regions
and
even
blinds
were
a
luxury
which
were
not
wasted
in
the
little
hall
consequently
when
my
unsatisfactory
wanderings
about
the
silent
house
for
no
one
else
was
up
led
me
that
dreadful
stormy
morning
into
the
narrow
passage
called
the
i
easily
saw
through
its
what
seemed
to
me
one
of
the
most
pathetic
sights
my
eyes
had
ever
rested
upon
just
outside
the
verandah
which
is
the
invariable
addition
to
new
zealand
houses
stood
bareheaded
a
tall
gaunt
figure
whose
garments
clung
closely
to
its
tottering
limbs
a
more
dismal
morning
could
not
well
be
imagined
the
early
dawn
struggling
to
make
itself
apparent
through
a
downpour
of
sleet
and
rain
the
howling
wind
which
one
could
almost
see
as
it
drove
the
vapour
wall
before
it
and
the
profound
solitude
and
silence
of
all
except
the
raging
storm
at
first
i
thought
i
must
be
dreaming
so
silent
and
hopeless
stood
that
weird
figure
my
next
impulse
without
staying
to
consider
my
dishevelled
hair
and
loose
wrapper
was
to
open
the
door
and
beckon
the
poor
man
within
the
shelter
of
the
verandah
when
once
i
had
got
him
there
i
did
not
exactly
know
what
to
do
with
my
guest
for
neither
fire
nor
food
could
be
procured
quite
so
early
he
crouched
like
a
stray
dog
down
on
the
dripping
mat
outside
the
door
and
murmured
some
unintelligible
words
in
this
dilemma
i
hastened
to
wake
up
poor
f
who
found
it
difficult
to
understand
why
i
wanted
him
to
get
up
at
daylight
during
a
but
i
entreated
him
to
go
to
the
hall
door
whilst
i
flew
off
to
get
my
lazy
maids
out
of
their
warm
beds
with
all
their
faults
they
did
not
need
much
rousing
on
that
occasion
i
suppose
i
used
very
forcible
words
to
convey
the
misery
of
the
object
standing
outside
for
i
know
that
mary
was
in
floods
of
tears
and
had
fastened
her
gown
on
over
her
whilst
i
was
still
speaking
and
the
cook
had
tumbled
out
of
bed
and
was
kneeling
before
the
kitchen
fire
with
her
eyes
shut
kindling
a
blaze
apparently
in
her
sleep
as
soon
as
things
were
in
this
forward
state
i
returned
to
the
verandah
and
found
our
swagger
guest
drawing
a
very
long
breath
after
a
good
nip
of
pure
whisky
which
f
had
promptly
administered
to
him
i
fair
clemmed
wi
cold
and
wet
the
swagger
said
still
bundled
up
in
his
comparatively
sheltered
corner
i
been
out
on
the
hills
the
whole
night
and
i
am
deadbeat
might
i
stop
here
for
a
bit
he
asked
this
very
doubtfully
for
it
is
quite
against
swagger
etiquette
to
demand
shelter
in
the
morning
for
all
answer
he
was
taken
by
the
shoulder
and
helped
up
i
never
shall
forget
the
poor
deprecating
face
as
he
looked
back
at
me
whilst
he
was
being
led
through
the
pretty
little
with
its
bright
carpet
on
which
his
boots
and
dripping
garments
left
a
muddy
as
well
as
a
watery
track
all
right
i
said
with
colonial
brevity
and
so
we
escorted
our
strange
guest
through
the
house
into
the
kitchen
where
the
kettle
and
gridiron
were
busy
preparing
tea
and
chops
over
a
blazing
fire
of
course
the
maids
screamed
when
they
saw
us
and
i
do
not
wonder
at
their
doing
so
for
neither
f
nor
i
looked
very
respectable
with
huddled
on
and
towzled
hair
whilst
our
drenched
guest
subsided
into
a
chair
by
the
door
covered
his
wretched
pinched
face
with
two
bony
hands
and
burst
into
tears
i
certainly
never
expected
to
see
a
swagger
cry
and
f
declared
the
sight
was
quite
as
new
to
him
as
to
me
however
the
poor
man
tears
and
helplessness
gave
fresh
energy
to
my
maids
treacherous
nerves
and
they
even
suggested
dry
clothes
our
cadet
who
at
this
moment
appeared
on
the
scene
was
only
too
happy
to
find
some
outlet
for
superfluous
benevolence
and
hastened
off
to
return
in
a
moment
or
two
with
an
old
flannel
shirt
dry
and
whole
in
spite
of
its
faded
stripes
a
pair
of
moleskin
trousers
and
a
huge
pair
of
canvas
cricketing
shoes
it
was
no
time
for
ceremony
so
we
women
retreated
for
a
few
minutes
into
the
whilst
f
and
a
made
the
swagger
toilette
getting
so
interested
in
their
task
as
even
to
part
his
dripping
hair
out
of
his
eyes
he
had
no
swag
poor
fellow
having
lost
his
roll
of
red
blankets
in
one
of
the
treacherous
across
the
range
that
man
was
exactly
like
a
lost
starving
dog
he
ate
an
enormous
breakfast
curled
himself
upon
some
empty
in
a
dry
corner
of
the
kitchen
and
slept
till
dinner
time
then
another
sleep
until
the
supper
hour
and
so
on
the
round
of
he
clock
all
this
time
he
never
spoke
though
we
were
dying
to
hear
how
he
had
come
into
such
a
plight
the
still
raged
furiously
out
of
doors
without
a
cessation
and
we
were
obliged
to
have
recourse
to
the
tins
of
meat
kept
in
the
for
such
an
emergency
the
shepherd
told
us
afterwards
he
had
ventured
out
to
look
for
some
wethers
his
own
supply
being
exhausted
but
the
whole
mob
had
hidden
themselves
so
cleverly
that
neither
man
nor
dog
could
discover
their
place
of
shelter
on
the
monday
night
exactly
a
week
after
the
outbreak
of
bad
weather
the
skies
showed
signs
of
having
exhausted
themselves
and
nature
began
to
wear
a
sulky
air
as
if
her
temper
were
but
slowly
recovering
herself
the
learned
in
such
matters
however
took
a
cheerful
view
of
affairs
and
declared
the
worst
to
be
over
for
this
bout
as
they
cautiously
added
whether
it
was
the
three
days
of
rest
warmth
and
good
food
which
unlocked
the
swagger
heart
or
not
i
do
not
pretend
to
decide
but
that
evening
over
a
pipe
in
the
kitchen
he
confided
to
a
that
he
had
been
working
his
way
down
to
the
from
a
station
where
he
had
been
employed
very
far
back
in
the
hill
ranges
the
had
overtaken
him
about
twenty
miles
from
us
but
only
five
from
another
station
where
he
had
applied
towards
the
evening
for
shelter
being
even
then
drenched
with
rain
and
worn
out
by
struggling
through
such
a
tremendous
storm
there
for
some
reason
which
i
confess
did
not
seem
very
clear
he
had
been
refused
the
unvarying
hospitality
extended
in
new
zealand
to
all
travellers
rich
or
poor
squatter
or
swagger
and
had
been
directed
to
take
a
short
cut
across
the
hills
to
our
station
which
he
was
assured
could
easily
be
reached
in
an
hour
or
two
more
the
track
a
difficult
one
enough
to
strike
in
summer
weather
became
indeed
impossible
to
discover
amid
rushing
torrents
and
driving
wind
and
rain
besides
which
as
the
poor
fellow
repeated
more
than
once
during
his
story
i
was
fair
done
up
when
i
set
out
for
i
been
travelling
all
day
a
told
us
what
the
man
had
been
saying
before
we
all
went
to
bed
adding
he
seems
an
odd
surly
kind
of
creature
for
although
he
declares
he
is
going
away
the
first
thing
if
the
rain
be
over
i
noticed
he
never
said
a
word
approaching
to
thanks
the
rain
was
indeed
over
next
morning
and
a
flood
of
brilliant
sunshine
awoke
me
bright
and
early
as
the
country
people
say
it
seemed
impossible
to
stop
in
bed
so
i
jumped
up
thrust
my
feet
into
slippers
and
my
arms
into
a
warm
and
sallied
forth
opening
window
after
window
so
as
to
let
the
sunshine
into
rooms
which
not
even
a
week
steady
could
render
damp
what
a
morning
it
was
and
for
too
no
haze
or
fog
or
vapour
on
all
the
green
hills
whose
sides
were
glistening
in
a
bright
glow
of
sunlight
for
the
first
time
too
since
the
bad
weather
had
set
in
was
to
be
heard
the
incessant
bleat
which
is
music
to
the
ears
of
a
new
zealand
white
moving
calling
patches
on
the
hillsides
told
that
the
sheep
were
returning
to
their
favourite
pastures
and
a
mob
of
horses
could
be
descried
quietly
feeding
on
the
sunny
flat
but
i
had
no
eyes
for
beauties
of
mountain
or
sky
i
could
do
nothing
but
gaze
on
the
strange
figure
of
the
silent
swagger
who
knelt
yes
positively
knelt
on
the
still
wet
and
shining
shingle
which
formed
an
apology
for
a
gravel
path
up
to
the
of
the
little
wooden
homestead
his
appearance
was
very
different
to
what
it
had
been
three
days
before
now
his
clothes
were
dry
and
clean
and
mended
my
irish
maids
doing
bless
their
warm
hearts
he
had
cobbled
up
his
boots
himself
and
his
felt
hat
which
had
quite
recovered
from
its
drenching
lay
at
his
side
the
perfect
rest
and
warmth
and
good
food
had
filled
up
his
hollow
cheeks
but
still
his
countenance
was
a
curious
one
and
never
until
my
dying
day
can
i
forget
the
rapture
of
entreaty
on
that
man
upturned
face
it
brings
the
tears
into
my
own
eyes
now
to
recollect
its
beseeching
expression
i
do
not
think
i
ever
prayer
before
or
since
he
did
not
perceive
me
for
i
had
hidden
behind
a
sheltering
curtain
to
listen
to
his
strange
earnest
petitions
so
he
could
not
know
that
anybody
in
the
house
was
stirring
for
he
knelt
at
the
back
and
all
my
fussings
had
taken
place
in
the
front
and
he
could
not
therefore
have
been
doing
anything
for
effect
there
exactly
where
he
had
crouched
a
wretched
tramp
in
pouring
rain
he
knelt
now
with
the
flood
of
sunshine
streaming
down
on
his
uplifted
face
whilst
he
prayed
for
the
welfare
and
happiness
individually
and
collectively
of
every
living
creature
within
the
house
then
he
stood
up
and
lifted
his
hat
from
the
ground
but
before
he
replaced
it
on
his
head
he
turned
with
a
gesture
which
would
have
made
the
fortune
of
any
orator
a
gesture
of
mingled
love
and
farewell
and
solemnly
blessed
the
which
had
sheltered
him
in
his
hour
of
need
i
could
not
help
being
struck
by
the
extraordinarily
good
language
in
which
he
expressed
his
fervent
desires
and
his
whole
bearing
seemed
quite
different
to
that
of
the
silent
man
we
had
kept
in
the
kitchen
these
last
three
days
i
watched
him
turn
and
go
noiselessly
closing
the
garden
gate
after
him
and
shall
i
confess
it
my
heart
has
always
felt
light
whenever
i
think
of
that
blessing
when
we
all
met
at
breakfast
i
had
to
take
his
part
and
tell
of
the
scene
i
had
witnessed
for
everybody
was
inclined
to
blame
him
for
having
stolen
away
scarcely
without
saying
or
expressing
a
word
of
thanks
for
the
kindness
he
had
received
but
i
knew
better
from
the
sublime
to
the
ridiculous
we
all
know
the
step
is
but
short
especially
in
the
human
mind
and
to
my
tender
mood
succeeds
the
recollection
of
an
absurd
panic
we
once
suffered
from
about
swaggers
exaggerated
stories
had
reached
us
brought
by
timid
fat
men
on
horseback
with
bulky
who
came
to
buy
our
wethers
for
the
hokitika
market
of
sticking
up
having
broken
out
on
the
west
land
i
fear
my
expressions
are
often
unintelligible
to
an
english
reader
but
in
this
instance
i
will
explain
sticking
up
is
merely
a
concise
colonial
rendering
of
your
money
or
your
life
and
was
originally
employed
by
australian
bushrangers
those
terrible
freebooters
whose
ranks
used
to
be
always
recruited
from
escaped
convicts
fortunately
we
had
no
community
of
that
class
only
a
few
prisoners
kept
in
a
little
ricketty
wooden
house
in
christchurch
from
which
an
enterprising
baby
might
easily
have
escaped
i
dare
say
as
we
get
more
civilized
out
there
we
shall
build
ourselves
handsome
prisons
and
penitentiaries
but
in
those
early
days
a
story
was
current
of
a
certain
jailor
who
let
all
his
captives
out
on
some
festal
occasion
using
the
tremendous
threat
that
whoever
had
not
returned
by
eight
should
be
out
but
to
return
to
that
particular
winter
evening
we
had
been
telling
each
other
stories
which
we
had
heard
or
read
of
bushranging
exploits
until
we
were
all
as
nervous
as
possible
ghosts
or
even
burglar
stories
are
nothing
to
the
horror
of
a
true
bushranger
story
and
f
had
made
himself
particularly
ghastly
and
disagreeable
by
giving
a
minute
account
of
an
adventure
which
had
been
told
to
him
by
one
of
the
survivors
we
listened
with
the
wind
howling
outside
to
f
horrid
story
of
how
one
fine
day
up
country
eight
or
ten
men
station
hands
were
stuck
up
by
one
solitary
bushranger
armed
to
the
teeth
he
tied
them
up
one
by
one
and
seated
them
all
on
a
bench
in
the
sun
and
deliberately
fired
at
and
wounded
the
youngest
of
the
party
then
seized
with
compunction
he
unbound
one
of
the
captives
and
stood
over
him
revolver
in
hand
whilst
he
saddled
and
mounted
a
horse
to
go
for
a
doctor
to
set
the
poor
boy
broken
leg
before
the
messenger
had
gone
a
league
a
league
but
barely
twa
the
freebooter
recollected
that
he
might
bring
somebody
else
back
with
him
besides
the
doctor
and
flinging
himself
across
his
horse
rode
after
the
affrighted
man
and
coolly
shot
him
dead
i
really
do
know
how
the
story
ended
i
believe
everybody
perished
but
at
this
juncture
i
declared
it
to
be
impossible
to
sit
up
any
longer
to
listen
to
such
tragedies
and
went
to
bed
exactly
at
midnight
the
proper
hour
for
ghosts
burglars
and
bushrangers
and
such
small
deer
to
be
about
everybody
was
awakened
simultaneously
by
a
loud
irregular
knocking
which
sounded
with
hollow
reverberations
all
through
the
wooden
house
bushrangers
we
all
thought
every
one
of
us
for
although
burglars
may
not
usually
knock
at
in
england
it
is
by
no
means
uncommon
for
their
bolder
brethren
to
do
so
at
the
other
end
of
the
world
it
is
such
a
comfort
to
me
now
looking
back
on
that
scene
to
remember
that
our
stalwart
cadet
was
as
frightened
as
anybody
stood
six
feet
one
in
his
stockings
and
was
a
match
for
any
two
in
the
country
side
and
yet
i
am
happy
to
think
he
was
as
bad
as
any
one
as
for
me
to
say
that
my
heart
became
like
water
and
my
knees
like
soft
wax
is
to
express
in
mild
words
my
state
of
abject
terror
there
was
no
need
to
inquire
what
the
maids
thought
for
smothered
shrieks
louder
and
louder
as
each
peal
of
knocks
vibrated
through
the
little
house
proclaimed
sufficiently
their
sentiments
on
the
subject
dear
me
how
ridiculous
it
all
must
have
been
in
one
corner
of
the
ceiling
of
our
bedroom
was
a
little
which
opened
into
an
attic
adjoining
that
where
the
big
cadet
slept
now
whilst
f
was
hurriedly
taking
down
his
gun
from
its
bracket
just
below
this
aperture
and
i
held
the
candlestick
with
so
shaky
a
hand
that
the
extinguisher
clattered
like
a
castanet
this
door
was
slowly
lifted
up
and
a
large
white
face
with
dishevelled
stubbly
hair
and
blue
eyes
looked
down
through
the
cobwebs
saying
in
a
husky
whisper
could
you
let
me
have
a
rifle
or
any
thing
this
was
our
gallant
cadet
who
had
no
idea
of
presenting
himself
at
a
disadvantage
before
the
foe
i
had
desperately
seized
a
revolver
but
f
declared
that
if
i
persisted
in
carrying
it
i
certainly
should
go
first
as
he
did
not
wish
to
be
shot
in
the
back
we
held
a
hurried
council
of
war
a
assisting
through
the
trap
door
and
the
maids
breathing
suggestions
through
the
but
the
difficulty
consisted
in
determining
at
which
door
the
knocking
was
going
on
some
said
one
and
some
another
for
there
were
many
modes
of
egress
from
the
tiny
dwelling
but
at
last
f
cried
decidedly
we
must
try
them
all
in
succession
and
shouldering
his
gun
with
the
revolver
sticking
in
the
girdle
of
his
sallied
valiantly
forth
i
do
know
what
became
of
a
i
believe
he
took
up
a
position
with
the
rifle
pointing
downwards
the
maids
retreated
beneath
their
blankets
and
i
too
frightened
to
stay
behind
followed
closely
armed
with
an
indian
f
flung
the
hall
door
wide
open
and
called
out
there
but
no
one
answered
the
silence
was
intense
and
so
was
the
cold
therefore
we
returned
speedily
indoors
to
consult
it
must
be
at
the
back
door
i
urged
adding
that
is
the
short
cut
down
the
valley
where
bushrangers
would
be
most
likely
to
come
bushrangers
you
silly
child
laughed
f
it
most
likely
a
belated
swagger
or
else
somebody
who
is
playing
us
a
trick
however
as
he
spoke
a
succession
of
fierce
and
loud
knocks
resounded
through
the
whole
house
it
must
be
at
the
kitchen
door
f
said
come
along
and
stand
well
behind
me
when
i
open
the
door
but
we
never
opened
the
door
for
on
our
way
through
the
kitchen
with
its
and
unceiled
roof
a
very
cavern
for
echoes
we
discovered
the
source
of
the
noise
and
of
our
fright
within
a
large
wooden
lay
a
poor
little
lamb
and
its
dying
throes
had
wakened
us
all
up
as
it
kicked
expiring
kicks
violently
against
the
side
of
the
box
it
was
my
doing
bringing
it
indoors
for
i
never
find
it
in
my
heart
to
leave
a
lamb
out
on
the
hills
if
we
came
across
a
dead
ewe
with
her
baby
bleating
desolately
and
running
round
her
body
f
always
said
you
can
not
rear
a
merino
lamb
indoors
the
poor
little
thing
will
only
die
all
the
same
in
a
day
or
two
and
then
i
am
sorry
to
say
he
added
in
an
unfeeling
manner
they
are
not
worth
much
now
as
if
that
could
make
any
difference
i
had
brought
this
as
i
had
brought
scores
of
others
home
in
my
arms
from
a
long
distance
off
fed
it
out
of
a
baby
bottle
rubbed
it
dry
and
put
it
to
sleep
in
a
warm
bed
of
hay
at
the
bottom
of
this
very
box
they
had
all
died
quietly
after
a
day
or
two
in
spite
of
my
devotion
and
nursing
but
this
little
foundling
kicked
herself
out
of
the
world
with
as
much
noise
as
would
have
sufficed
to
summon
a
garrison
to
surrender
it
is
all
very
well
to
laugh
at
it
now
but
we
were
five
valiant
souls
in
all
as
thoroughly
frightened
at
the
time
as
we
could
well
be
the
only
real
harm
a
swagger
did
me
was
to
carry
off
one
of
my
best
maidservants
as
his
wife
but
as
he
had
pounds
in
the
bank
at
christchurch
and
was
only
travelling
about
looking
for
work
and
they
have
lived
in
great
peace
and
prosperity
ever
since
i
suppose
i
ought
not
to
complain
this
swagger
was
employed
in
deepening
our
well
and
mary
was
always
going
to
see
how
he
was
getting
on
so
he
used
to
make
love
to
her
looking
up
from
the
bottom
of
a
deep
shaft
and
shouting
compliments
to
her
from
a
depth
of
sixty
feet
what
really
won
her
irish
heart
though
was
his
calmly
putting
a
rival
a
shepherd
into
a
she
could
not
resist
that
so
they
were
married
and
are
doing
well
let
no
one
despise
swaggers
they
are
merely
travelling
workmen
and
would
pay
for
their
lodging
if
it
was
the
custom
to
do
so
i
am
told
that
even
now
they
are
fast
becoming
things
of
the
past
for
one
could
not
swagger
by
railroad
and
most
of
our
beautiful
happy
vallies
will
soon
have
a
line
of
rails
laid
down
throughout
its
green
and
peaceful
length
chapter
x
changing
servants
to
the
eyes
of
an
english
housewife
the
title
of
this
chapter
must
appear
a
very
bad
joke
indeed
and
the
amusement
what
the
immortal
poyser
would
call
a
poor
tale
far
be
it
from
me
to
make
light
of
the
misery
of
a
tolerably
good
servant
coming
to
you
after
three
service
just
as
you
were
beginning
to
feel
settled
and
comfortable
and
announcing
with
a
smile
that
she
was
going
to
be
married
or
with
a
flood
of
tears
that
she
found
it
lonesome
either
of
these
two
contingencies
was
pretty
sure
to
arise
at
least
four
times
a
year
on
a
station
at
first
i
determined
to
do
all
i
could
to
make
their
new
home
so
attractive
to
my
two
handmaidens
that
they
would
not
wish
to
leave
it
directly
in
one
of
wilkie
collins
books
an
upholsterer
is
represented
as
saying
that
if
you
want
to
domesticate
a
woman
you
should
surround
her
with
maple
and
chintz
that
must
have
been
exactly
my
idea
for
the
two
rooms
which
i
prepared
for
my
maidservants
were
small
indeed
yet
exquisitely
pretty
of
course
i
should
not
have
been
so
foolish
as
to
buy
any
of
the
unnecessary
and
dainty
fittings
with
which
they
were
decorated
but
as
all
the
furniture
and
belongings
of
an
english
house
a
good
deal
larger
than
our
station
home
had
been
taken
out
to
it
there
were
sundry
toilet
tables
whose
destination
would
have
been
a
loft
over
the
stable
if
i
had
not
used
them
for
my
maids
i
had
seen
and
chosen
two
very
respectable
young
women
in
christchurch
one
as
a
cook
and
the
other
as
a
housemaid
the
cook
euphemia
by
name
was
a
tall
fat
flabby
woman
with
a
pasty
complexion
but
a
nice
expression
of
face
and
better
manners
than
usual
she
turned
out
to
be
very
good
natured
perfectly
ignorant
though
willing
to
learn
and
was
much
admired
by
the
neighbouring
or
small
farmers
lois
the
housemaid
was
the
smallest
and
skimpiest
and
most
angular
girl
i
ever
beheld
at
first
i
regarded
her
with
deep
compassion
imagining
that
she
was
about
fifteen
years
of
age
and
had
been
cruelly
and
starved
how
she
divined
what
was
passing
in
my
mind
i
can
not
tell
but
during
our
first
interview
she
suddenly
fired
up
and
informed
me
that
she
was
years
old
that
she
was
the
seventh
child
of
a
seventh
child
and
therefore
absolutely
certain
to
achieve
some
wonderful
piece
of
good
luck
and
furthermore
that
she
had
been
much
admired
in
her
own
part
of
the
country
and
was
universally
allowed
to
be
the
flower
of
the
province
this
statement
delivered
with
great
volubility
and
defiant
jerkiness
of
manner
rather
took
my
breath
away
but
it
was
a
case
of
hobson
choice
just
then
about
servants
and
as
i
was
assured
she
was
a
respectable
girl
i
closed
with
her
terms
pounds
a
year
and
all
found
on
the
spot
the
fat
pale
cook
was
to
get
pounds
i
hear
that
wages
are
somewhat
lower
but
the
sums
i
have
named
were
the
average
figures
of
six
or
seven
years
ago
especially
here
i
feel
impelled
to
repeat
the
substance
of
what
i
have
stated
elsewhere
that
these
rough
queer
servants
were
as
a
general
rule
perfectly
honest
and
of
irreproachable
morals
besides
working
in
their
own
curious
fashion
desperately
hard
our
family
was
an
exceptionally
small
one
and
the
place
was
considered
light
you
bet
but
even
then
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
both
my
domestics
worked
very
hard
in
the
first
place
there
was
the
washing
two
days
severe
work
under
difficulties
which
they
thought
nothing
of
all
the
clothes
had
to
be
taken
to
a
boiler
fixed
in
the
side
of
a
hill
for
the
convenience
of
the
creek
and
washed
and
rinsed
under
a
blazing
sun
for
of
course
it
never
was
attempted
on
a
wet
day
and
amid
clouds
of
not
until
evening
was
this
really
hard
day
work
over
and
the
various
garments
fluttering
in
the
breeze
up
a
valley
behind
the
house
the
chances
were
strongly
in
favour
of
a
tremendous
coming
down
this
said
valley
during
the
night
and
in
that
case
there
would
not
be
a
sign
next
morning
of
any
of
the
clothes
heavy
things
such
as
sheets
or
table
cloths
might
be
safely
looked
for
under
lee
of
the
nearest
gorse
hedge
but
it
would
be
impossible
even
to
guess
where
the
lighter
and
more
diaphanous
articles
had
been
whisked
to
a
week
afterwards
the
shepherds
used
to
bring
in
stray
cuffs
and
collars
and
upon
one
occasion
judy
the
calf
was
discovered
in
a
paddock
hard
by
breakfasting
off
my
best
pocket
handkerchiefs
with
an
excellent
appetite
of
course
everything
was
dirty
and
needed
to
be
washed
over
again
we
had
a
mangle
which
greatly
simplified
matters
on
the
second
day
but
it
used
not
to
be
uncommon
on
stations
to
get
up
the
fine
things
with
a
flat
stone
heated
in
the
wood
ashes
for
an
iron
after
the
washing
operations
had
been
brought
to
a
more
or
less
successful
ending
there
came
the
yeast
making
and
the
baking
followed
by
the
brewing
of
sugar
beer
preserves
had
to
be
made
bacon
cured
all
sorts
of
things
to
be
done
besides
the
daily
duties
of
scrubbing
and
cleaning
and
cooking
at
all
hours
for
stray
visitors
or
swaggers
but
i
am
overcome
with
contrition
at
perceiving
into
what
a
digression
i
have
wandered
having
strayed
from
my
maids
rooms
to
their
duties
they
arrived
as
usual
on
a
dray
late
in
the
evening
tired
and
wearied
enough
poor
souls
in
those
early
days
i
had
not
yet
plucked
up
courage
to
try
my
hand
in
the
kitchen
and
our
meals
had
been
left
to
the
charge
of
f
who
whatever
he
may
be
in
other
relations
of
life
is
a
vile
cook
and
our
cadet
u
who
was
exceedingly
willing
but
profoundly
ignorant
of
the
elements
of
cookery
for
fear
of
being
tempted
into
another
digression
i
will
briefly
state
that
during
that
week
i
lived
in
a
chronic
state
of
hunger
and
heartburn
and
sought
forgetfulness
from
repeated
attacks
of
indigestion
by
decorating
my
servants
rooms
they
opened
into
each
other
and
it
would
have
been
hard
to
find
two
prettier
little
nests
each
had
its
shining
brass
bedstead
with
chintz
hangings
its
toilette
table
and
its
daintily
curtained
window
besides
a
pretty
carpet
i
can
remember
now
the
sort
of
dazed
look
with
which
euphemia
regarded
a
room
such
as
she
had
never
seen
whilst
lois
considered
it
to
be
an
instalment
of
her
good
luck
and
proceeded
to
contemplate
her
sharp
and
elfish
countenance
in
her
pronouncing
it
as
her
opinion
that
she
wanted
more
colour
that
she
certainly
did
and
she
might
have
added
more
flesh
and
youthfulness
while
she
was
about
it
however
they
were
greatly
delighted
and
euphemia
who
was
of
a
grateful
and
affectionate
disposition
actually
thanked
me
for
having
with
my
own
hands
arranged
such
pretty
rooms
for
them
this
was
a
very
good
beginning
they
were
both
civil
girls
and
got
on
very
well
together
leaving
me
plenty
of
leisure
to
attend
to
the
quantities
of
necessary
arrangements
which
have
to
be
made
when
you
are
settling
yourself
for
good
fifty
miles
from
a
shop
and
on
a
spot
where
no
other
human
being
has
ever
lived
before
f
congratulated
myself
in
private
on
my
exceptional
good
luck
and
attributed
it
partly
to
my
having
followed
the
upholsterer
advice
in
that
book
of
wilkie
collins
but
as
it
turned
out
f
was
dwelling
in
a
fool
paradise
in
vain
had
it
been
pointed
out
to
me
that
a
certain
stalwart
north
countryman
whose
shyness
could
only
be
equalled
by
his
appetite
had
been
a
most
regular
attendant
for
some
weeks
past
at
our
sunday
evening
services
accepting
the
offer
of
tea
in
the
kitchen
afterwards
with
great
alacrity
i
scouted
these
insinuations
appealing
to
the
general
sense
of
the
public
as
to
whether
moffatt
had
been
known
to
refuse
a
meal
anywhere
or
under
any
circumstances
and
declaring
that
if
he
was
courting
it
was
being
done
in
solemn
silence
for
never
a
sound
filtered
through
the
thin
wooden
planks
between
the
kitchen
and
the
dining
room
except
the
clatter
of
a
vigorously
plied
knife
and
fork
for
moffatt
teas
always
included
a
shoulder
of
mutton
but
i
was
wrong
and
others
were
right
early
in
october
our
second
spring
month
i
chanced
to
get
up
betimes
one
delicious
calm
morning
a
morning
when
it
seemed
a
new
and
exquisite
pleasure
to
open
each
window
in
succession
and
fill
one
lungs
with
a
deep
deep
breath
of
that
heavenly
atmosphere
at
once
so
fresh
and
so
pure
quiet
as
the
little
homestead
lay
nestled
among
the
hills
there
were
too
many
morning
noises
stirring
among
the
animals
for
any
one
to
feel
lonely
or
dull
i
should
have
thought
from
a
distance
came
a
regular
monotonous
lowing
sound
that
was
hetty
the
pretty
little
yellow
alderney
announcing
from
the
swamps
that
she
and
her
two
female
friends
were
quite
ready
to
be
milked
their
calves
answered
them
dutifully
from
the
english
grass
paddock
and
between
the
two
i
could
see
u
tall
figure
stalking
down
the
flat
with
his
cattle
dog
at
his
heels
and
hear
his
merry
whistle
shrilling
through
the
silent
air
then
all
the
ducks
and
fowls
about
the
place
were
inquiring
in
noisy
cackle
how
long
it
would
be
before
breakfast
was
ready
whilst
helen
whinneying
made
me
turn
my
head
to
see
her
with
a
mob
of
horses
at
her
heels
coming
over
the
nearest
ridge
on
the
chance
of
a
stray
carrot
or
two
going
begging
all
the
dogs
were
pulling
at
the
staples
of
their
fastenings
and
entreating
by
short
joyous
barks
to
be
allowed
just
one
good
frisk
and
roll
in
the
sparkling
dewy
grass
around
but
even
i
universal
spoiler
of
animals
that
i
am
was
obliged
to
harden
my
heart
against
their
noisy
appeals
for
quite
close
to
the
stable
on
the
nearest
an
immense
mob
of
sheep
and
young
lambs
were
feeding
that
steep
incline
had
been
burnt
six
weeks
before
and
was
now
as
green
as
the
clover
field
at
its
base
affording
a
delicious
pasturage
to
these
nursing
mothers
and
their
frisky
infants
i
think
i
see
and
hear
it
all
now
the
moving
white
patches
on
the
the
incessant
calling
and
answering
the
racing
and
chasing
among
the
curly
little
merino
lambs
and
above
all
the
fair
earth
the
clear
vault
of
an
almost
cloudless
sky
bent
itself
in
a
deep
blue
dome
just
over
the
eastern
hills
the
first
long
lances
of
the
sun
lay
in
bright
shafts
of
silver
sheen
on
the
tussocks
and
that
peculiar
morning
fragrance
rose
up
from
the
moist
ground
which
is
as
much
the
reward
of
the
early
riser
as
the
early
worm
is
of
the
bird
was
it
a
morning
for
low
spirits
or
sobs
and
sighs
surely
not
and
yet
as
i
turned
the
handle
of
the
kitchen
door
those
melancholy
sounds
struck
my
ear
i
had
intended
to
make
my
entrance
with
a
propitiatory
smile
suitable
to
such
a
glorious
morning
proceed
to
pay
my
damsels
a
graceful
compliment
on
their
somewhat
unusual
early
rising
and
wind
up
with
a
request
for
a
cup
of
tea
but
all
these
friendly
purposes
went
out
of
my
head
when
i
beheld
euphemia
seated
on
the
rude
wooden
settle
with
its
chopped
tussock
mattrass
which
had
been
covered
with
a
bright
cotton
damask
and
was
now
called
respectfully
the
kitchen
sofa
her
arm
was
round
lois
waist
and
she
had
drawn
that
young
lady
shock
head
of
red
curls
down
on
her
capacious
bosom
both
were
crying
as
if
their
hearts
would
break
and
startled
as
i
felt
to
see
these
floods
of
tears
it
struck
me
how
incongruous
their
attitude
looked
against
the
background
of
the
large
window
through
which
all
nature
looked
so
smiling
and
sparkling
the
kettle
was
singing
on
the
fire
everything
seemed
bright
and
snug
and
comfortable
indoors
what
in
the
world
has
happened
i
gasped
really
frightened
nothing
mem
its
only
them
sheep
sobbed
euphemia
calling
like
they
always
makes
me
cry
your
tea
be
ready
directly
mem
this
last
with
a
deep
sigh
is
it
possible
you
are
crying
about
that
i
inquired
yes
mem
yes
said
euphemia
in
accents
clasping
lois
who
was
positively
howling
closer
to
her
sympathetic
heart
its
terrible
to
hear
they
keeps
calling
and
answering
each
other
and
that
makes
us
think
of
our
home
and
friends
now
both
these
women
had
starved
as
factory
hands
all
their
lives
and
i
used
to
feel
much
more
inclined
to
cry
when
they
told
me
all
unconscious
of
the
pathos
stories
of
their
baby
work
and
hardships
certainly
they
had
never
seen
a
sheep
until
they
came
to
new
zealand
and
as
they
had
particularly
mentioned
the
silence
which
used
to
reign
supreme
at
the
manufactory
during
work
hours
i
could
not
trace
the
connection
between
a
dingy
smoky
factory
and
a
bright
spring
morning
in
this
delightful
valley
what
nonsense
i
cried
half
laughing
and
half
angry
you
ca
be
in
earnest
why
you
must
both
be
ill
let
me
give
you
each
a
good
dose
of
medicine
i
said
this
encouragingly
for
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
euphemia
liked
so
much
as
good
substantial
physic
and
the
only
thing
i
ever
needed
to
keep
locked
up
from
her
was
the
medicine
drawer
euphemia
seemed
touched
and
grateful
and
her
face
brightened
up
directly
but
lois
looked
up
with
her
frightful
little
face
more
ugly
than
usual
as
she
said
spitefully
physic
wo
make
them
nasty
sheep
hold
their
tongues
i
sure
is
the
place
for
me
to
find
my
luck
so
i
rather
go
if
you
please
mem
i
every
one
o
them
gullies
and
never
seen
the
colour
yet
so
it
ai
any
good
my
stopping
this
was
quite
a
fresh
light
thrown
upon
the
purpose
of
lois
long
lonely
rambles
she
used
to
be
off
and
away
over
the
hills
whenever
she
had
finished
her
daily
work
and
i
encouraged
her
rambles
thinking
the
fresh
air
and
exercise
must
do
her
a
world
of
good
never
had
i
guessed
that
the
sordid
little
puss
was
turning
over
every
stone
in
the
creek
in
her
search
for
the
shining
flakes
why
did
you
think
you
should
find
gold
here
i
asked
because
they
do
say
it
lies
in
all
these
mountain
streams
she
answered
sullenly
and
i
always
dreaming
of
nuggets
not
that
a
girl
with
my
face
and
figure
wants
to
set
her
off
however
but
if
its
all
the
same
to
you
mem
i
rather
leave
when
euphemia
does
are
going
then
i
inquired
turning
reproachfully
to
my
cook
who
actually
coloured
a
little
as
she
answered
well
mem
you
see
moffatt
says
he
got
his
window
frames
in
now
and
glass
them
the
very
first
chance
and
i
think
it
be
more
company
for
me
on
saddler
flat
so
if
you
please
to
send
me
down
in
the
dray
i
should
be
obliged
here
was
a
pretty
upset
and
i
went
about
my
with
a
heavy
heart
how
was
i
to
get
fresh
servants
and
above
all
what
was
i
to
do
for
cooking
during
the
week
they
were
away
these
questions
fortunately
settled
themselves
in
rather
an
unexpected
manner
i
heard
of
a
very
nice
willing
girl
who
was
particularly
anxious
to
come
up
as
housemaid
to
my
part
of
the
world
on
condition
that
i
should
also
engage
as
cook
her
sister
who
was
leaving
a
place
on
the
opposite
side
of
a
range
of
high
hills
to
the
south
i
shall
only
briefly
say
that
all
inquiries
about
these
damsels
proved
satisfactory
and
i
could
see
euphemia
and
lois
depart
with
tolerable
equanimity
the
former
wept
and
begged
for
a
box
of
cockles
pills
but
lois
tossed
her
elfish
head
and
gave
me
to
understand
that
she
had
never
been
properly
admired
or
appreciated
whilst
in
my
service
chapter
xii
culinary
troubles
i
want
to
lodge
a
formal
complaint
against
all
cookery
books
they
are
not
the
least
use
in
the
world
until
you
know
how
to
cook
and
then
you
can
do
without
them
somebody
ought
to
write
a
cookery
book
which
would
tell
an
unhappy
beginner
whether
the
water
in
which
she
proposes
to
put
her
potatoes
is
to
be
hot
or
cold
how
long
such
water
is
to
boil
how
she
is
to
know
whether
the
potatoes
are
done
enough
how
to
dry
them
after
they
have
boiled
and
similar
things
which
make
all
the
difference
in
the
world
to
speak
like
brooke
for
a
moment
rice
now
i
have
dabbled
in
that
a
good
deal
myself
and
found
it
would
do
at
all
of
course
in
time
and
after
many
failures
i
did
learn
to
boil
a
potato
which
would
not
disgrace
me
and
to
bake
bread
besides
in
time
attaining
to
puddings
and
cakes
of
which
i
do
mind
confessing
i
was
modestly
proud
it
used
to
be
a
study
i
am
told
to
watch
my
face
when
a
cake
had
turned
out
as
it
ought
gratified
vanity
at
the
lavish
encomiums
bestowed
on
it
and
horrified
dismay
at
the
rapidity
with
which
a
good
sized
cake
disappeared
down
the
throats
of
the
company
warred
together
in
the
most
artless
fashion
the
reflection
would
arise
that
it
was
almost
a
pity
it
should
be
eaten
up
so
very
fast
yet
was
it
not
a
fine
thing
to
be
able
to
make
such
a
cake
and
oh
would
the
next
be
equally
good
one
lesson
i
leaned
in
my
new
zealand
kitchen
and
that
was
not
to
be
too
hard
on
the
point
of
breakages
for
no
one
knows
unless
from
personal
experience
how
true
was
the
irish
cook
apology
for
breaking
a
dish
when
she
said
that
it
let
go
of
her
hand
i
declare
that
i
used
at
last
to
regard
my
plates
and
dishes
cups
and
saucers
yea
even
the
pudding
basons
not
as
so
much
china
and
delf
but
as
troublesome
imps
possessed
with
an
insane
desire
to
dash
themselves
madly
on
the
kitchen
floor
upon
the
least
provocation
every
woman
knows
what
a
slippery
thing
to
hold
is
a
baby
in
its
tub
i
am
in
a
position
to
pronounce
that
wet
plates
and
dishes
are
far
more
difficult
to
keep
hold
of
they
have
a
way
of
leaping
out
of
your
fingers
which
must
be
felt
to
be
believed
after
my
first
week
in
my
kitchen
i
used
to
wonder
not
at
the
breakages
but
at
anything
remaining
unbroken
my
maids
had
a
very
ingenious
method
of
disposing
of
the
fragments
of
their
pottery
misfortunes
at
the
back
of
the
house
an
open
patch
of
ground
thickly
covered
with
an
of
native
grass
and
the
usual
large
proportion
of
sheltering
tussocks
stretched
away
to
the
foot
of
the
nearest
hill
this
was
burned
every
second
year
or
so
and
when
the
fire
had
passed
away
the
sight
it
revealed
was
certainly
very
curious
beneath
each
tussock
had
lain
concealed
a
small
heap
of
broken
china
which
must
have
been
placed
there
in
the
dead
of
the
night
the
delinquents
had
evidently
been
at
the
pains
to
perfect
their
work
of
destruction
by
reducing
the
china
articles
in
question
to
the
smallest
imaginable
fragments
for
fear
of
a
protruding
corner
betraying
the
clever
and
the
contrast
afforded
to
the
blackened
ground
on
which
they
lay
by
the
gay
patches
of
tiny
fragments
huddled
together
was
droll
indeed
that
was
the
moment
for
recognising
the
remains
of
a
favourite
jug
or
plate
or
even
a
beloved
there
they
were
all
laid
in
neat
little
heaps
and
the
best
of
it
was
that
the
existing
cook
always
declared
loudly
her
astonishment
at
the
base
ingenuity
of
such
conduct
although
i
could
not
fail
to
recognise
many
a
plate
or
dish
which
had
disappeared
from
the
land
of
the
living
during
her
reign
all
housekeepers
will
sympathise
with
my
feelings
at
seeing
an
amateur
scullion
who
had
distinguished
himself
greatly
in
the
balaklava
charge
but
who
appeared
to
have
no
idea
that
boiling
water
would
scald
his
fingers
drop
the
top
plate
of
a
pile
which
he
had
placed
in
a
tub
before
him
in
spite
of
my
entreaties
to
be
allowed
to
myself
he
gallantly
declared
that
he
could
do
it
beautifully
and
that
the
great
thing
was
to
have
the
water
very
hot
in
pursuance
of
this
theory
he
poured
the
contents
of
a
kettle
of
boiling
water
over
his
plates
plunged
his
hand
in
and
dropped
the
top
plate
with
a
shriek
of
dismay
on
those
beneath
it
out
of
consideration
for
that
emigrant
feelings
i
abstain
from
publishing
the
list
of
the
killed
and
wounded
briefly
stating
that
he
might
almost
as
well
have
fired
a
shot
among
my
poor
plates
a
perfect
fountain
of
water
and
chips
and
bits
of
china
flew
up
into
the
air
and
i
really
believe
that
hardly
one
plate
remained
uncracked
so
much
for
one
friends
i
must
candidly
state
that
although
the
servants
broke
a
good
deal
we
destroyed
twice
as
much
amongst
us
during
the
week
which
must
needs
elapse
between
their
departure
and
the
arrival
of
the
new
ones
shall
i
ever
forget
the
guilty
pallor
which
overspread
the
bronzed
and
bearded
countenance
of
one
of
my
guests
who
particularly
wished
to
dust
the
ornaments
when
on
hearing
a
slight
crash
i
came
into
the
room
and
found
him
picking
up
the
remains
of
a
china
shepherdess
considering
everything
i
kept
my
temper
remarkably
well
merely
observing
that
he
had
better
go
into
the
verandah
and
sit
down
with
a
book
and
his
pipe
and
send
joey
in
to
help
me
joey
was
a
little
black
monkey
from
panama
who
had
to
be
provided
with
broken
bits
of
delf
or
china
in
order
that
he
might
amuse
himself
by
breaking
them
ingeniously
into
smaller
fragments
but
the
real
object
of
this
chapter
was
to
relate
some
of
my
own
private
misfortunes
in
the
cooking
line
once
when
alice
s
was
staying
with
me
and
we
had
no
servants
she
and
i
undertook
to
bake
a
very
infantine
and
unweaned
pig
it
was
all
properly
arranged
for
us
and
making
up
a
good
fire
we
proceeded
to
cook
the
little
monster
hours
passed
by
all
the
rest
of
the
dinner
got
itself
properly
cooked
at
the
right
time
but
the
pig
presented
exactly
the
same
appearance
at
dewy
eve
as
it
had
done
in
the
early
morn
we
looked
rather
at
its
pale
condition
when
one
struck
but
i
said
cheerfully
oh
i
daresay
it
will
be
ready
by
supper
but
it
was
not
not
a
bit
of
it
of
course
we
searched
in
those
delusive
cookery
books
but
they
only
told
us
what
sauces
to
serve
with
a
roasted
pig
or
how
to
garnish
it
entering
minutely
into
a
disquisition
upon
whether
a
lemon
or
an
orange
had
better
be
stuck
into
its
mouth
we
wanted
to
know
how
to
cook
it
and
why
it
would
not
get
itself
baked
about
an
hour
before
i
grew
desperate
at
the
anticipation
of
the
chaff
alice
and
i
would
certainly
have
to
undergo
if
this
detestable
animal
could
not
be
produced
in
a
sufficiently
cooked
state
by
evening
we
took
it
out
of
the
oven
and
contemplated
it
with
silence
and
dismay
fair
as
ever
did
that
pig
appear
and
as
if
it
had
no
present
intention
of
being
cooked
at
all
a
sudden
idea
came
into
our
heads
at
the
same
moment
but
it
was
alice
who
first
whispered
let
us
cut
off
its
head
yes
i
cried
i
am
sure
that
prevents
its
roasting
or
baking
or
whatever
it
is
so
we
got
out
the
big
carving
knife
and
cut
off
the
piggy
head
far
be
it
from
me
to
offer
any
solution
of
the
theory
why
the
head
should
have
interfered
with
the
baking
process
but
all
i
know
is
that
like
the
old
woman
in
the
nursery
song
everything
began
to
go
right
and
we
got
our
supper
that
night
has
anybody
ever
reflected
on
how
difficult
it
must
be
to
get
a
chimney
swept
without
ever
a
sweep
or
even
a
brush
luckily
our
chimneys
were
short
and
wide
and
we
used
a
good
deal
of
wood
so
in
three
years
the
kitchen
chimney
only
needed
to
be
cleansed
twice
the
first
time
it
was
cleared
of
soot
by
the
simple
process
of
being
set
on
fire
but
as
a
light
was
blowing
the
risk
to
the
wooden
roof
became
very
great
and
could
only
be
met
by
spreading
wet
blankets
over
the
shingles
we
had
a
very
narrow
escape
of
losing
our
little
wooden
house
and
it
was
fortunate
it
happened
just
at
the
men
dinner
hour
when
there
was
plenty
of
help
close
at
hand
however
great
my
satisfaction
at
feeling
that
at
last
my
chimney
had
been
thoroughly
swept
there
was
evidently
too
much
risk
about
the
performance
to
admit
of
its
being
repeated
so
about
a
year
afterwards
i
asked
an
old
chum
what
i
was
to
do
with
my
chimney
sweep
it
with
a
to
be
sure
she
replied
i
mentioned
this
primitive
receipt
at
home
and
the
idea
was
carried
out
a
day
or
two
later
by
one
man
mounting
on
the
roof
of
the
house
whilst
another
remained
in
the
kitchen
the
individual
on
the
roof
threw
down
a
rope
to
the
one
below
who
fastened
a
large
in
the
middle
they
each
held
an
end
of
this
rope
and
so
pulled
it
up
and
down
the
chimney
until
the
man
below
was
as
black
as
any
veritable
sweep
and
had
to
betake
himself
clothes
and
all
to
a
neighbouring
creek
as
for
the
kitchen
its
state
can
not
be
better
described
than
in
my
irish
words
who
cried
did
mortial
man
ever
see
sich
a
ridiklous
mess
arrah
why
could
ye
let
it
be
thin
but
for
all
that
she
set
bravely
to
work
and
got
everything
clean
and
nice
once
more
merely
stipulating
that
the
next
time
we
were
going
to
sweep
chimney
we
should
let
her
know
beforehand
that
she
might
go
somewhere
right
away
i
feel
however
that
in
all
these
reminiscences
i
am
straying
widely
from
the
point
which
was
before
my
mind
when
i
began
this
chapter
and
that
is
the
delusiveness
of
a
cookery
book
no
book
which
i
have
ever
seen
tells
you
for
instance
how
to
boil
rice
properly
they
all
insist
that
the
grains
must
be
white
and
dry
and
separate
but
they
omit
to
describe
the
process
by
which
these
results
can
be
attained
they
tell
you
what
you
are
to
do
with
your
rice
after
it
is
boiled
but
not
how
to
boil
it
the
fact
is
i
suppose
that
the
people
who
write
such
books
began
so
early
to
be
cooks
themselves
that
they
forget
there
ever
was
a
time
when
such
simple
things
were
unknown
to
them
even
when
i
had
after
many
failures
mastered
the
art
of
boiling
rice
and
also
of
making
an
excellent
curry
for
which
accomplishment
i
was
indebted
to
the
practical
teaching
of
a
neighbour
there
used
still
to
be
misfortunes
in
store
for
me
one
of
these
caused
me
such
a
bitter
disappointment
that
i
have
never
quite
forgotten
it
this
was
the
manner
of
it
we
were
without
servants
my
readers
must
not
suppose
that
such
was
our
chronic
condition
but
when
you
come
to
change
your
servants
three
or
four
times
a
year
and
have
to
do
for
yourself
each
time
during
the
week
which
must
elapse
before
the
arrival
of
new
ones
there
is
an
ample
margin
for
every
possible
domestic
misadventure
if
any
doubt
me
let
them
try
for
themselves
on
this
special
occasion
which
proved
to
be
nearly
the
last
my
mind
was
easy
for
the
simple
reason
that
i
was
now
independent
of
cookery
books
i
had
puzzled
out
all
the
elementary
parts
of
the
science
for
myself
and
had
no
misgivings
on
the
subject
of
potatoes
or
even
peas
so
confident
was
i
and
vain
that
i
volunteered
to
make
a
curry
for
breakfast
such
a
savoury
curry
as
it
was
and
it
turned
out
to
be
all
that
the
heart
of
a
hungry
man
could
desire
so
did
the
rice
i
really
felt
proud
of
that
rice
each
grain
kept
itself
duly
apart
from
its
fellow
and
was
as
soft
and
white
and
plump
as
possible
everything
went
well
and
i
had
plenty
of
assistants
to
carry
in
the
substantial
breakfast
as
fast
as
it
was
ready
the
coffee
toast
all
the
other
things
had
gone
in
even
the
curry
had
been
borne
off
amid
many
compliments
and
now
it
only
remained
for
me
to
dish
up
the
rice
imagine
the
scene
the
bright
pretty
kitchen
with
its
large
window
through
which
you
could
see
the
green
hills
around
dotted
with
sheep
the
creek
chattering
along
just
outside
whilst
close
to
the
back
door
loitered
a
crowd
of
fowls
and
ducks
on
the
chance
of
fate
sending
them
something
extra
to
eat
beneath
the
large
window
and
just
in
front
of
it
stood
a
large
deal
table
and
it
used
to
be
my
custom
to
transfer
the
contents
of
the
saucepans
to
the
dishes
at
that
convenient
place
well
i
emptied
the
rice
into
its
dish
and
gazed
fondly
at
it
for
a
moment
any
cook
might
have
been
proud
of
that
beautiful
heap
of
grains
i
had
boiled
a
great
quantity
more
than
necessary
it
seemed
for
although
the
dish
was
piled
up
almost
as
high
as
it
would
hold
some
rice
yet
remained
in
the
saucepan
oh
that
i
had
been
content
to
leave
it
there
but
no
with
a
certain
spasmodic
frugality
which
has
often
been
my
bane
i
shook
the
saucepan
vehemently
in
order
to
dislodge
some
more
of
its
contents
into
my
already
full
dish
as
i
did
so
my
treacherous
wrist
strained
by
the
weight
of
the
saucepan
gave
way
and
with
the
rapidity
of
a
trick
i
found
the
great
black
saucepan
seated
yes
that
is
the
only
word
for
it
seated
in
the
midst
of
my
heap
of
rice
which
was
now
covered
by
fine
black
powder
from
its
sooty
outside
all
the
rice
was
utterly
and
completely
spoiled
i
do
believe
that
five
clean
grains
were
left
in
the
dish
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
leave
it
to
get
cold
and
then
throw
it
all
out
for
the
fowls
who
do
mind
au
it
seems
although
i
feel
more
than
half
ashamed
to
confess
it
i
am
by
no
means
sure
i
did
not
retire
into
the
and
shed
a
tear
over
the
fate
of
that
rice
everybody
else
laughed
but
i
was
dreadfully
mortified
and
vexed
chapter
xiii
amateur
servants
i
flattered
myself
on
a
certain
occasion
that
i
had
made
some
very
artful
arrangements
to
provide
the
family
with
something
to
eat
during
the
servants
absence
i
had
been
lamenting
the
week
of
experiments
in
food
which
would
be
sure
to
ensue
so
soon
as
the
dray
should
leave
in
the
hearing
of
a
gallant
young
who
had
come
out
to
new
zealand
to
try
and
see
if
one
could
gratify
tastes
requiring
say
a
thousand
a
year
to
provide
for
on
an
income
of
pounds
he
was
just
finding
out
that
it
was
quite
as
difficult
to
manage
this
in
the
southern
as
in
the
northern
hemisphere
but
his
hearty
cheery
manner
and
enormous
stock
of
hope
kept
him
up
for
some
time
i
come
and
cook
for
you
he
cried
i
can
cook
like
a
bird
but
i
ca
wash
up
no
no
it
burns
too
much
if
you
can
get
somebody
to
wash
up
i
cook
and
just
look
here
it
would
be
very
nice
if
we
could
have
some
music
after
dinner
you
got
a
piano
have
you
that
right
well
now
do
you
ask
that
pretty
miss
a
who
has
just
come
out
from
england
to
come
and
stop
with
you
and
then
we
could
have
some
music
where
did
you
learn
to
cook
i
inquired
suspiciously
for
f
had
also
assured
me
could
cook
and
this
had
upset
my
confidence
on
the
west
coast
to
be
sure
ask
vere
and
williams
and
taylor
and
everybody
if
they
tasted
such
pies
as
i
used
to
make
them
my
countenance
must
have
still
looked
rather
doubtful
because
i
well
remember
sundry
verbal
testimonials
of
capability
being
produced
and
as
i
was
still
very
ignorant
of
the
rudiments
of
the
science
of
cookery
i
shrank
from
assuming
the
whole
responsibility
of
the
family
meals
so
the
household
was
arranged
in
this
way
captain
george
head
cook
u
miss
a
housemaid
myself
forsyth
a
young
naval
officer
butler
on
the
principle
of
giving
honour
to
whom
honour
is
due
this
gallant
lieutenant
deserves
special
mention
for
the
way
he
cleaned
glass
he
did
not
pay
much
attention
to
his
silver
but
his
glass
would
have
passed
muster
at
a
club
the
only
drawback
was
the
immense
time
he
took
over
each
glass
and
the
way
he
followed
either
miss
a
or
me
all
about
the
house
holding
a
tumbler
in
one
hand
and
a
long
clean
in
the
other
calling
upon
us
to
admire
the
polish
of
the
crystal
to
clean
two
tumblers
would
be
a
good
day
work
for
him
from
monday
to
saturday
when
the
dray
returned
this
state
of
things
went
on
of
course
i
had
taken
the
precaution
of
having
a
good
supply
of
bread
made
beforehand
besides
cakes
and
biscuits
tarts
and
pies
everything
to
save
trouble
but
it
was
not
of
much
use
for
alleging
that
they
were
working
so
hard
the
young
men
f
at
their
head
though
i
was
always
telling
him
he
was
married
and
ought
to
know
better
set
to
work
and
ate
up
everything
immediately
as
completely
as
if
they
had
been
locusts
and
then
they
were
all
so
dreadfully
wild
and
unmanageable
mine
was
by
far
the
hardest
task
of
all
the
keeping
them
in
any
sort
of
order
for
instance
captain
george
declared
one
day
that
if
there
was
one
thing
he
did
better
than
another
it
was
to
make
jam
consequently
a
fatigue
party
was
ordered
out
to
gather
strawberries
and
after
more
than
half
had
been
eaten
on
the
way
to
the
house
a
stewpan
was
filled
i
had
to
do
most
of
the
skimming
as
captain
george
wanted
to
practice
a
duet
with
miss
a
i
may
as
well
mention
here
that
we
never
had
any
opportunity
of
seeing
how
the
jam
kept
because
the
smell
pervaded
the
whole
house
to
such
an
extent
that
declaring
they
felt
like
schoolboys
again
the
gentlemen
fell
on
my
half
dozen
pots
of
preserves
in
a
body
carried
them
off
and
ate
them
all
up
then
and
there
announcing
afterwards
there
had
just
been
a
pot
it
was
really
a
dreadful
time
although
we
got
well
cooked
for
captain
george
wasted
quite
as
much
as
he
used
the
pigs
fed
sumptuously
that
week
on
his
failures
in
sauces
minces
puddings
and
what
not
he
had
insisted
on
our
making
him
a
paper
cap
and
a
linen
apron
or
rather
a
dozen
linen
aprons
for
he
was
perpetually
blackening
his
apron
and
casting
it
aside
then
he
used
suddenly
to
cease
to
take
any
interest
in
his
occupation
and
seating
himself
sideways
on
the
kitchen
dresser
begin
to
whistle
through
a
whole
opera
or
repeat
pages
of
poetry
i
tried
the
experiment
of
banishing
miss
a
from
the
kitchen
during
cooking
hours
but
a
few
bars
played
on
the
piano
were
quite
enough
to
distract
my
cook
from
his
work
my
only
quiet
time
was
the
afternoon
when
about
four
my
amateur
servants
all
went
out
for
a
ride
and
left
me
in
peace
for
a
couple
of
hours
i
had
enough
to
do
during
that
short
time
to
tidy
up
to
collect
the
scattered
books
and
music
and
prepare
the
for
which
they
came
back
in
tearing
spirits
and
frantically
hungry
between
seven
and
eight
after
this
meal
had
been
cleared
away
and
u
and
i
had
washed
up
the
others
declaring
they
were
too
tired
to
stir
we
all
used
to
adjourn
to
the
verandah
it
happened
to
be
an
exceptionally
week
no
dry
hot
nor
cold
wet
and
it
was
perfectly
delicious
to
sit
out
in
the
verandah
and
rest
after
the
labours
of
the
day
in
our
cane
the
balmy
air
was
so
soft
and
fresh
and
the
intense
silence
all
around
so
profound
unfortunately
there
was
a
full
moon
i
say
unfortunately
because
the
flood
of
pale
light
suggested
to
these
dreadful
young
men
the
feasibility
of
having
what
they
called
a
servant
ball
in
vain
i
declared
that
the
housekeeper
was
never
expected
to
dance
oh
yes
laughed
captain
george
i
often
danced
with
a
housekeeper
and
very
jolly
it
was
too
come
along
f
her
dance
and
i
was
forced
to
gallopade
up
and
down
that
verandah
till
i
felt
half
dead
with
fatigue
the
boards
had
a
tremendous
spring
and
the
verandah
built
by
f
by
the
way
was
very
wide
and
roomy
so
it
made
an
excellent
as
for
the
trifling
difficulty
about
music
that
was
supplied
by
captain
george
and
u
whistling
in
turn
time
being
kept
by
clapping
the
top
and
bottom
of
my
silver
butter
dish
together
oh
dear
it
takes
my
breath
away
now
even
to
think
of
those
evenings
i
see
alice
a
flitting
about
in
her
white
dress
and
wreath
dancing
like
the
slender
sylph
she
really
was
but
never
can
i
forget
the
odd
effect
of
the
feet
no
one
had
their
dress
boots
up
at
the
station
and
as
alice
and
i
firmly
declined
to
dance
with
anybody
who
wore
cookham
boots
great
heavy
things
with
nails
in
the
soles
they
had
no
other
course
open
to
them
except
to
wear
their
smart
slippers
there
were
slippers
of
purple
velvet
embroidered
with
gold
others
of
blue
kid
delicately
traced
in
crimson
lines
foxes
heads
stared
at
us
in
startling
perspective
from
a
scarlet
ground
or
black
figures
disported
themselves
on
orange
then
these
slippers
were
all
more
or
less
of
an
easy
fit
and
had
a
way
of
flying
out
on
the
lawn
suddenly
startling
my
dear
dog
nettle
out
of
his
first
sleep
ah
well
that
may
be
an
absurd
bit
of
one
life
to
look
back
upon
but
its
days
were
bright
and
innocent
enough
health
was
so
perfect
that
the
mere
sensation
of
being
alive
became
happiness
and
all
the
noise
of
the
eager
bustling
pushing
world
seemed
shut
away
by
those
steep
hills
which
folded
our
quiet
valley
in
their
green
arms
people
have
often
said
to
me
since
surely
you
would
not
like
to
have
lived
there
for
ever
perhaps
not
i
can
only
say
that
three
years
of
that
calm
idyllic
life
held
no
weary
hour
for
me
and
i
am
quite
sure
that
quiet
time
was
a
great
blessing
to
me
in
many
ways
first
of
all
in
health
for
a
person
must
be
in
a
very
bad
way
indeed
for
new
zealand
air
not
to
do
them
a
world
of
good
next
in
teaching
me
amid
a
great
deal
of
fun
and
laughter
sundry
useful
accomplishments
not
easily
learned
in
our
luxurious
civilization
and
lastly
those
few
years
of
seclusion
from
the
turmoil
of
life
brought
leisure
to
think
out
one
own
thoughts
and
to
sift
them
from
other
peoples
ideas
under
such
circumstances
it
is
hard
if
the
unregarded
river
of
our
life
as
matthew
arnold
so
finely
call
it
be
not
perceived
for
one
then
becomes
aware
of
his
life
flow
and
bears
its
winding
murmur
and
he
sees
the
meadows
where
it
glides
the
sun
the
breeze
and
there
arrives
a
lull
in
the
hot
race
wherein
he
doth
for
ever
chase
that
flying
and
elusive
shadow
rest
one
good
effect
of
my
sufferings
with
a
house
full
of
unruly
volunteers
was
that
during
the
brief
stay
only
two
months
of
my
next
cook
i
set
to
work
assiduously
to
learn
as
many
kitchen
mysteries
as
she
could
teach
me
and
so
became
independent
of
captain
george
or
f
or
any
other
amateur
good
bad
or
indifferent
nothing
could
be
more
extraordinary
than
the
way
in
which
the
two
affectionate
sisters
mentioned
earlier
and
who
succeeded
euphemia
and
lois
quarrelled
they
were
very
unlike
each
other
in
appearance
and
one
fruitful
source
of
bickering
arose
from
their
respective
styles
of
beauty
not
only
did
they
wrangle
and
rave
at
each
other
all
the
day
long
during
every
moment
of
their
spare
time
but
after
they
had
gone
to
bed
we
could
hear
them
quite
plainly
calling
out
to
each
other
from
their
different
rooms
if
i
begged
them
to
be
quiet
there
might
be
silence
for
a
moment
but
it
would
shortly
be
broken
by
maria
calling
out
i
say
dinah
do
you
go
for
to
wear
green
my
girl
i
only
tell
you
friendly
but
you
a
deal
too
yellow
for
that
it
suits
i
so
fresh
and
rosy
but
you
never
have
my
not
if
you
live
to
be
eighty
good
night
i
thought
i
just
mention
it
while
i
remembered
this
used
to
aggravate
dinah
dreadfully
and
she
would
retaliate
by
repeating
some
complimentary
speech
of
old
ben
or
long
tom
the
stockman
and
then
there
would
be
no
peace
for
an
hour
their
successors
were
clarissa
and
eunice
eunice
wept
sore
for
a
whole
month
over
her
sweeping
and
cleaning
to
this
day
i
have
not
the
dimmest
idea
she
gave
me
warning
amid
floods
of
tears
directly
she
arrived
though
i
could
not
make
out
any
other
tangible
complaint
than
that
the
dray
had
jolted
as
never
was
and
to
clarissa
i
gave
warning
the
first
day
i
came
into
the
kitchen
she
received
me
seated
on
the
kitchen
table
swinging
her
legs
which
did
not
nearly
touch
the
floor
she
had
carefully
arranged
her
position
so
as
to
turn
her
back
towards
me
and
she
went
on
picking
her
teeth
with
a
i
stood
aghast
at
this
specimen
of
colonial
manners
which
was
the
more
astonishing
as
i
knew
the
girl
had
lived
in
the
service
of
a
gentleman
family
in
the
north
of
england
for
some
time
before
she
sailed
dear
me
clarissa
i
cried
is
that
the
way
you
behaved
at
colonel
st
john
clarissa
looked
at
me
very
coolly
over
her
shoulder
i
must
mention
she
was
a
very
pretty
girl
and
but
with
a
temper
and
giving
her
plump
shoulders
a
little
shrug
said
no
in
course
not
was
gentlefolks
they
was
i
confess
i
felt
rather
nettled
at
this
and
yet
it
was
difficult
to
be
angry
with
a
girl
who
looked
like
a
grown
up
and
very
pretty
baby
i
restrained
my
feelings
and
said
well
i
should
like
you
to
behave
here
as
you
did
there
suppose
you
get
off
the
table
and
come
and
look
what
we
can
find
in
the
store
room
i
looked
round
she
declared
there
much
to
be
seen
my
patience
began
to
run
short
and
i
said
very
firmly
you
must
get
off
the
table
directly
clarissa
and
stand
and
speak
properly
or
i
shall
send
you
down
to
christchurch
again
i
suppose
that
was
exactly
what
the
damsel
wished
for
she
made
no
movement
whereat
i
said
in
great
wrath
very
well
then
you
shall
leave
at
the
end
of
a
month
and
so
she
did
having
bullied
everybody
out
of
their
lives
during
that
time
whilst
we
are
on
the
subject
of
manners
it
may
not
be
out
of
place
to
relate
a
little
episode
of
my
early
days
up
country
i
think
i
have
alluded
in
station
life
in
new
zealand
to
our
book
club
but
i
do
know
that
it
has
been
explained
that
i
used
to
change
the
books
on
sunday
afternoon
after
our
little
evening
service
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
induce
the
men
to
come
from
an
immense
distance
twice
a
week
and
it
was
therefore
necessary
that
they
should
be
able
to
get
a
fresh
book
after
service
nothing
could
have
been
better
than
the
behaviour
of
my
little
congregation
they
made
it
a
point
of
giving
no
trouble
whatever
with
their
horses
or
dogs
and
they
were
so
afraid
of
being
supposed
to
come
for
what
they
could
get
that
i
had
some
difficulty
in
inducing
those
who
travelled
from
a
distance
to
have
a
cup
of
tea
in
the
kitchen
before
they
mounted
to
set
off
on
their
long
solitary
ride
homewards
they
were
also
exceedingly
quiet
and
for
if
even
a
dozen
men
or
more
were
standing
outside
in
fine
weather
or
waiting
within
the
kitchen
if
it
were
wet
or
windy
not
a
sound
could
be
heard
if
they
spoke
to
each
other
it
was
in
the
lowest
whisper
and
they
would
no
more
have
thought
of
lighting
their
pipes
anywhere
near
the
house
than
they
would
of
flying
this
innate
tact
and
true
gentlemanly
feeling
which
struck
me
so
much
in
the
labouring
man
as
he
appears
in
new
zealand
made
the
lapse
of
good
manners
to
which
i
am
coming
all
the
more
remarkable
of
course
they
never
touched
their
hats
to
me
they
would
make
me
a
bow
or
take
their
hats
but
they
never
touched
them
i
have
often
seen
a
hand
raised
involuntarily
to
the
soft
felt
hat
which
every
one
wears
there
but
the
mechanical
action
would
be
arrested
by
the
recollection
of
the
first
article
of
the
old
colonial
creed
jack
is
as
good
as
his
master
i
never
minded
this
in
the
least
and
got
so
completely
out
of
the
habit
of
expecting
any
salutations
that
it
seemed
quite
odd
to
me
to
receive
them
again
on
my
return
no
what
i
objected
to
was
that
when
i
used
to
go
into
my
kitchen
about
ten
minutes
or
so
after
the
service
had
been
concluded
with
the
list
of
club
books
in
my
hand
not
a
single
man
rose
from
his
seat
they
seemed
to
make
it
a
point
to
sit
down
somewhere
on
a
table
or
window
seat
if
all
the
chairs
were
occupied
but
at
all
events
not
to
be
found
standing
they
would
bend
their
heads
and
blush
and
glance
shyly
at
each
other
for
encouragement
as
i
came
in
but
no
one
got
up
or
took
his
hat
off
this
went
on
for
a
few
weeks
until
i
felt
sure
that
this
curious
behaviour
did
not
spring
from
forgetfulness
or
inattention
when
i
mentioned
my
grievance
in
the
to
the
gentlemen
i
only
got
laughed
at
for
my
pains
and
i
was
asked
what
else
i
expected
to
this
question
used
to
be
added
sundry
anecdotes
of
earlier
colonial
life
intended
to
reconcile
me
to
the
manners
of
these
later
days
i
remember
particularly
a
legend
of
a
man
cook
who
was
said
to
have
walked
into
the
of
the
station
where
the
master
was
practising
tunes
on
an
accordion
and
exclaimed
now
look
here
boss
if
you
do
leave
off
that
there
noise
which
perwents
me
gettin
a
wink
o
sleep
i
clear
out
o
this
sharp
mornin
so
now
yer
know
and
with
that
remark
he
returned
to
his
bunk
at
last
i
was
goaded
to
declare
i
felt
sure
that
the
men
only
behaved
in
that
way
from
crass
ignorance
and
that
if
they
knew
how
much
my
feelings
were
hurt
they
would
alter
their
manners
directly
this
opinion
was
received
with
such
incredulity
that
i
felt
roused
to
declare
i
should
try
the
experiment
next
sunday
afternoon
the
only
warning
which
at
all
daunted
me
was
the
assurance
that
i
should
affront
my
congregation
and
scare
them
away
it
was
the
dread
of
this
which
made
my
heart
beat
so
fast
and
my
hands
turn
so
cold
as
i
opened
the
the
next
sunday
afternoon
there
were
exactly
the
same
attitudes
every
body
perfectly
civil
and
respectful
but
every
body
seated
luckily
my
courage
rose
at
the
right
moment
and
i
came
forward
as
usual
with
a
smile
and
said
look
here
my
men
there
is
one
little
thing
i
want
to
ask
you
do
you
know
that
it
is
not
the
custom
anywhere
in
any
civilized
country
for
gentlemen
to
remain
seated
and
covered
when
a
lady
comes
into
the
room
if
i
were
to
go
into
a
room
in
england
where
the
prince
of
wales
or
any
of
the
finest
gentlemen
of
the
land
were
sitting
just
as
you
are
now
they
would
all
get
up
the
prince
first
most
likely
and
they
would
certainly
take
off
their
hats
now
why
ca
you
all
do
the
same
here
the
effect
of
my
little
speech
was
magical
pepper
glanced
at
mcquhair
moffatt
crimsoned
and
nudged
mckenzie
wiry
ben
slipped
off
the
and
shyed
his
hat
across
the
kitchen
whilst
long
tom
the
thanked
me
kindly
for
mentioning
of
it
and
every
body
got
up
directly
and
took
their
hats
off
i
felt
immensely
proud
of
my
success
and
hastened
the
moment
of
my
return
to
the
drawing
room
where
i
announced
my
triumph
i
repeated
my
little
speech
as
concisely
as
possible
but
alas
it
was
not
nearly
so
well
received
as
it
had
been
in
the
kitchen
have
you
ever
gone
to
see
a
london
club
one
person
inquired
ah
i
thought
not
i
do
know
about
the
prince
because
he
always
do
the
prettiest
things
at
the
right
moment
but
i
doubt
very
much
about
all
the
others
i
fear
you
have
made
a
very
wild
assertion
to
get
your
own
way
i
need
hardly
say
i
sulked
at
that
incredulous
individual
for
many
days
but
he
always
stuck
firmly
to
his
own
opinion
however
my
men
never
required
another
hint
they
came
just
as
regularly
as
usual
to
church
and
we
all
lived
happily
ever
after
i
feel
that
my
chapter
should
end
here
but
any
record
of
my
new
zealand
servants
would
be
incomplete
without
mention
of
my
bearded
cook
every
body
thinks
when
i
say
this
that
i
am
going
to
tell
them
about
a
man
but
it
is
nothing
of
the
sort
isabella
lyon
in
spite
of
her
pronounced
beard
was
a
very
fine
woman
exceedingly
looking
and
with
most
amiable
prepossessing
manners
she
had
not
long
arrived
and
had
been
at
once
snapped
up
for
an
hotel
but
she
applied
for
my
place
saying
she
wished
for
quiet
and
a
country
life
could
any
thing
be
more
propitious
i
thought
like
lois
that
my
luck
so
long
in
turning
was
improving
and
that
at
last
i
was
to
have
a
cook
who
knew
her
business
and
so
she
did
thoroughly
and
delightfully
for
one
brief
fortnight
we
lived
on
dainties
never
could
i
have
believed
that
such
a
variety
of
dishes
could
have
been
produced
out
of
mutton
in
fact
we
seemed
to
have
everything
at
table
except
the
staple
dish
unlike
the
cook
who
actually
sent
me
in
a
roast
shoulder
of
mutton
for
breakfast
one
morning
isabella
prided
herself
on
eliminating
the
monotonous
animal
from
her
bills
of
fare
certainly
she
was
rather
heavy
on
the
sauces
and
i
was
trying
to
pluck
up
courage
to
remonstrate
as
it
would
not
be
easy
or
cheap
to
replace
them
before
a
certain
time
of
year
and
then
she
was
so
clean
so
smiling
and
so
she
seemed
to
treat
us
all
as
if
we
were
a
parcel
of
children
for
whom
she
was
never
weary
of
preparing
surprises
as
for
me
i
felt
miserable
if
any
shepherd
or
handsome
young
bachelor
cockatoo
came
near
the
place
dreading
lest
the
wretch
should
have
designs
on
my
cook
heart
and
hand
i
rejoiced
in
her
beard
and
would
not
have
had
her
without
it
for
worlds
as
i
selfishly
hoped
it
might
stand
in
her
matrimonial
path
this
arcadian
state
of
kitchen
affairs
went
on
for
exactly
a
fortnight
one
evening
at
the
end
of
that
time
we
had
been
out
riding
and
returned
as
usual
very
hungry
what
are
we
going
to
have
for
supper
inquired
f
i
told
him
what
had
been
ordered
but
when
that
meal
made
its
appearance
lo
there
was
not
a
single
dish
which
i
had
named
the
things
were
not
exactly
nasty
but
they
were
queer
for
instance
pears
are
not
usually
stewed
in
gravy
but
they
were
by
no
means
bad
and
we
took
it
for
granted
it
was
something
quite
new
the
housemaid
sarah
looked
very
nervous
and
scared
and
glanced
at
me
from
time
to
time
with
a
very
wistful
look
but
i
was
so
delightfully
tired
and
sleepy
one
never
seemed
to
get
beyond
the
pleasant
stage
of
those
sensations
that
i
did
not
ask
any
questions
next
morning
when
we
came
out
to
breakfast
imagine
my
astonishment
at
seeing
a
tureen
of
half
cold
soup
on
the
table
and
nothing
else
i
could
hardly
believe
my
eyes
and
hastened
to
the
kitchen
to
explain
that
this
was
rather
too
much
of
a
novelty
in
the
gastronomic
line
if
i
live
to
be
a
hundred
years
old
i
shall
never
forget
the
sight
at
once
terrible
and
absurd
which
met
my
eyes
before
the
kitchen
fire
stood
isabella
having
evidently
slept
in
her
clothes
all
night
she
looked
wretched
and
bloated
and
quite
curiously
dirty
as
black
as
if
she
had
been
up
the
chimney
and
even
i
could
see
that
early
as
was
the
hour
she
was
hopelessly
drunk
between
both
of
her
nerveless
black
hands
she
held
a
poker
with
which
she
struck
from
time
to
time
a
feeble
blow
on
a
heap
of
plates
which
she
persisted
in
considering
a
lump
of
coal
the
fire
was
nearly
out
but
she
hastened
to
assure
me
that
if
she
could
only
break
this
lump
of
coal
it
would
soon
burn
up
need
i
say
that
i
rescued
my
plates
at
once
and
marched
the
bearded
one
off
to
her
own
apartment
oh
how
dimmed
its
dainty
freshness
had
become
since
even
yesterday
sarah
was
summoned
and
confessed
that
she
had
known
last
night
that
hisabella
had
gone
on
the
burst
having
bought
for
some
fabulous
sum
a
bottle
of
rum
from
a
passing
swagger
it
was
all
very
dreadful
and
worst
of
all
was
the
scene
of
tears
and
penitence
i
had
to
endure
when
the
rum
was
finished
the
dray
however
relieved
me
of
the
incubus
of
her
presence
and
that
was
the
only
instance
of
drunkenness
i
came
across
among
my
domestic
changes
and
chances
chapter
xiv
our
pets
one
of
the
first
things
which
struck
me
when
i
came
to
know
a
little
more
about
the
feelings
and
ways
of
my
neighbours
in
the
malvern
hills
was
the
good
understanding
which
existed
between
man
and
beast
i
am
afraid
i
must
except
the
poor
sheep
for
i
never
heard
them
spoken
of
with
affection
nor
do
i
consider
that
they
were
the
objects
of
any
special
humanity
even
on
their
owners
parts
this
must
surely
arise
from
their
enormous
numbers
how
can
you
be
fond
of
thousands
of
anything
said
a
shepherd
once
to
me
in
answer
to
some
sentimental
inquiry
of
mine
respecting
his
feelings
towards
his
flock
that
is
the
fact
there
were
too
many
sheep
in
our
happy
arcadia
for
any
body
to
value
or
pet
them
on
a
large
scale
they
were
looked
after
carefully
water
and
sheltered
feed
and
undisturbed
camping
grounds
all
these
good
things
were
provided
for
them
and
in
return
they
were
expected
to
yield
a
large
percentage
of
lambs
and
a
good
clip
even
the
touching
patience
of
the
poor
animals
beneath
the
shears
or
amid
the
dust
and
noise
of
the
yards
was
generally
despised
as
stupidity
far
different
is
the
feeling
of
the
new
zealander
whether
he
be
squatter
or
cockatoo
towards
his
horse
and
his
dog
they
are
the
faithful
friends
and
often
the
only
companions
of
the
lonely
man
of
course
there
will
soon
be
no
lonely
men
anywhere
but
a
few
years
ago
there
were
plenty
of
unwilling
robinson
crusoes
in
the
middle
island
and
whenever
i
came
upon
one
of
these
pastoral
hermits
i
was
sure
to
find
a
dog
or
a
horse
a
cat
or
even
a
hen
established
as
mate
to
some
poor
solitary
from
whom
all
human
companionship
was
shut
out
by
mountain
rock
or
river
are
you
not
lonely
here
was
often
my
first
instinctive
question
as
i
have
dismounted
at
the
door
of
a
shepherd
hut
in
the
back
country
and
listened
to
the
eternal
roar
of
the
river
which
formed
his
boundary
or
the
still
more
oppressive
silence
which
seemed
to
have
reigned
ever
since
the
creation
well
mum
it
aint
very
lively
but
i
got
topsy
producing
a
black
kitten
from
his
pocket
and
there
the
dogs
and
i
shall
have
some
fowls
next
year
but
my
object
in
beginning
this
chapter
was
not
to
enter
into
a
disquisition
on
other
people
pets
with
which
after
all
one
can
have
but
a
distant
acquaintance
but
to
introduce
some
of
my
own
especial
favourites
to
those
kind
and
sympathetic
readers
who
take
pleasure
in
hearing
of
my
own
somewhat
solitary
existence
in
that
distant
land
i
am
quite
ready
to
acknowledge
that
i
never
thoroughly
comprehended
the
individuality
of
animals
even
of
fowls
and
ducks
until
i
lived
up
at
the
station
perhaps
like
their
masters
they
really
get
to
possess
more
independence
of
character
under
those
free
and
easy
skies
for
where
would
you
meet
with
such
a
worldly
and
selfish
cat
as
sandy
or
so
fastidious
and
intelligent
a
smooth
terrier
as
rose
sandy
was
an
old
bachelor
of
a
sleek
appearance
red
in
colour
but
with
a
good
deal
of
white
and
wristbands
as
to
the
of
which
he
was
most
particular
it
was
easy
to
imagine
sandy
sitting
in
a
club
window
and
i
am
he
had
a
slight
tendency
to
gout
and
reading
french
novels
sandy
selfishness
was
quite
open
and
he
liked
you
very
much
until
somebody
else
came
whom
he
liked
better
and
then
he
would
desert
his
oldest
friend
without
hesitation
i
do
suppose
the
wildest
young
ever
dreamed
of
chasing
or
worrying
sandy
who
would
not
have
stirred
from
his
warm
corner
by
the
fire
for
snarleyow
himself
every
now
and
then
sandy
must
have
felt
alarmed
about
his
health
or
his
figure
for
he
ate
less
and
walked
gravely
and
sulkily
up
and
down
the
verandah
for
hours
but
as
soon
as
he
considered
himself
out
of
danger
he
relapsed
into
all
his
ways
no
one
ventured
to
offer
sandy
anything
but
the
choicest
meats
and
he
was
wont
to
sit
up
and
beg
like
a
dog
for
a
savoury
but
he
would
revenge
himself
on
you
afterwards
for
the
humiliation
you
might
be
sure
what
always
appeared
to
me
so
odd
was
that
in
spite
of
his
known
and
unblushing
selfishness
sandy
used
to
be
a
great
favourite
and
we
all
vied
with
each
other
for
the
honour
of
his
notice
now
why
was
this
if
boundless
time
and
space
were
at
our
disposal
we
might
go
deeply
into
the
question
and
work
it
out
but
as
the
dimensions
of
this
volume
are
not
elastic
the
impending
social
essay
shall
be
postponed
and
we
will
confine
ourselves
to
a
brief
description
of
sandy
outer
cat
he
was
of
a
pure
breed
far
removed
from
the
lanky
race
of
ordinary
who
from
time
to
time
disappeared
into
the
bush
and
contracted
alliances
with
the
still
more
degraded
specimens
of
their
class
who
had
long
been
wild
among
the
scrub
no
sandy
came
of
pur
sang
and
held
his
small
square
head
erect
with
a
haughty
carriage
as
beseemed
his
ancestry
his
fur
was
really
beautiful
a
sort
of
tortoiseshell
red
the
lighter
stripes
repeating
exactly
the
different
golden
tints
of
a
fashionable
chignon
in
early
youth
though
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
sandy
ever
a
playful
kitten
his
tail
had
been
curtailed
to
the
length
of
three
inches
and
this
short
flexible
stump
gave
an
air
of
great
decision
to
sandy
movements
but
his
chief
peculiarity
and
i
must
add
attraction
in
my
opinion
was
the
perfume
of
his
sleek
coat
when
sandy
condescended
to
take
his
evening
doze
on
my
linsey
lap
i
never
smelt
anything
so
strange
and
so
agreeable
as
the
odour
of
his
fur
specially
that
on
the
top
of
his
head
it
was
like
the
most
delicate
musk
but
without
any
of
the
sickly
smell
common
to
that
scent
i
believe
sandy
knew
of
this
personal
peculiarity
and
felt
proud
of
it
a
far
more
unselfish
and
agreeable
personage
was
rose
the
white
terrier
whose
name
often
finds
a
loving
place
in
these
pages
she
and
sandy
dwelt
together
in
peace
and
amity
although
the
little
doggie
never
could
have
felt
any
affection
for
her
selfish
companion
nerves
were
of
a
delicate
and
order
and
there
was
nothing
she
hated
so
much
as
uproarious
noise
every
now
and
then
it
chanced
that
during
a
few
days
of
wet
or
windy
weather
our
little
house
had
been
filled
by
passing
guests
gentlemen
who
had
called
in
to
ask
for
supper
and
a
bed
intending
to
go
on
next
day
in
a
country
where
inns
or
are
fifty
miles
apart
this
is
a
common
incident
and
it
sometimes
happens
that
the
resources
of
station
hospitality
are
taxed
to
the
utmost
in
this
way
i
have
known
our
own
little
wooden
box
to
be
so
closely
packed
that
besides
a
guest
on
each
sofa
in
the
there
would
be
another
on
a
sort
of
portable
couch
in
the
this
was
after
the
spare
room
had
been
filled
to
the
utmost
a
delicate
new
chum
who
required
to
be
pampered
had
retired
to
rest
on
the
hard
kitchen
sofa
described
elsewhere
whilst
a
couple
of
sturdy
travellers
were
sleeping
soundly
in
the
saddle
room
after
that
there
could
be
nothing
for
the
last
comer
except
a
in
red
blankets
it
happened
i
observed
that
everybody
arrived
together
for
weeks
we
would
be
alone
i
lived
once
for
eight
months
without
seeing
a
lady
and
then
some
fine
evening
half
a
dozen
acquaintances
would
turn
up
there
really
is
no
other
word
for
it
well
on
these
occasions
when
instead
of
departing
next
morning
our
impromptu
guests
have
sometimes
been
forced
to
wait
until
such
time
as
the
rain
or
the
wind
should
cease
their
animal
spirits
became
often
too
much
for
them
and
they
would
feel
an
irresistible
impulse
to
get
rid
of
some
of
their
superfluous
health
and
strength
by
violent
exercise
i
set
my
face
at
once
against
athletic
sports
or
feats
of
strength
being
performed
in
my
little
although
they
were
always
very
anxious
to
secure
me
for
the
solitary
spectator
and
i
forget
who
hit
upon
the
happy
thought
of
turning
the
empty
into
a
temporary
gymnasium
there
these
wild
boys
for
in
spite
of
stalwart
frames
and
bushy
beards
the
southern
colonist
heart
keeps
very
fresh
and
young
used
to
adjourn
and
hop
and
leap
wrestle
and
box
fence
and
spar
to
their
active
young
limbs
content
they
seemed
very
happy
and
loud
were
the
joyous
shouts
and
peals
of
laughter
over
the
failures
but
after
seeing
the
performance
once
or
twice
i
generally
became
tired
and
bored
and
used
to
slip
away
to
the
house
and
my
quiet
corner
by
the
fire
rose
considered
it
her
duty
to
remain
at
her
master
heels
as
long
as
possible
but
after
a
time
she
too
would
creep
back
to
silence
and
warmth
though
she
never
deserted
her
post
until
the
noise
grew
altogether
too
much
for
her
nerves
and
then
with
a
despairing
whimper
sometimes
swelling
to
a
howl
poor
little
rose
would
tuck
her
tail
between
her
legs
and
dash
out
through
the
storm
to
seek
shelter
and
quiet
with
me
whenever
rose
appeared
thus
suddenly
in
my
quiet
retreat
i
felt
sure
some
greater
uproar
than
usual
was
going
on
down
at
the
and
more
than
once
on
inquiry
i
found
rose
nerves
must
have
been
tried
to
the
utmost
before
she
turned
and
fled
as
for
the
intelligence
of
a
volume
could
be
written
on
the
facts
concerning
them
and
a
still
more
entertaining
book
on
the
fictions
for
a
new
zealand
shepherd
will
always
consider
it
a
point
of
honour
to
cap
his
neighbour
anecdote
of
dog
sagacity
by
a
yet
stronger
proof
of
canine
intelligence
i
shall
only
briefly
allude
to
one
dog
whose
history
will
probably
be
placed
in
the
colonial
archives
a
colley
who
knows
his
master
brand
and
who
will
when
the
sheep
get
boxed
that
is
mixed
together
pick
out
with
unfailing
accuracy
all
the
bleating
members
of
his
own
flock
from
amid
the
confused
terrified
mass
as
for
the
patience
of
a
good
dog
in
crossing
sheep
over
a
river
i
have
witnessed
that
myself
and
been
forced
to
draw
conclusions
very
much
in
favour
of
the
dog
over
the
human
beings
who
were
directing
the
operation
some
dogs
again
who
are
perfectly
helpless
with
sheep
are
unrivalled
with
cattle
and
i
have
stood
on
the
edge
of
a
swamp
more
than
once
and
seen
a
dog
go
after
a
couple
of
milch
cows
and
fetch
them
out
of
a
herd
of
bullocks
returning
for
the
second
milky
mother
after
the
first
had
been
brought
right
up
within
reach
of
the
stockman
lash
then
among
my
horse
friends
was
a
certain
suffolk
punch
who
had
been
christened
the
artful
dodger
from
his
trick
of
counterfeiting
lameness
the
moment
he
was
put
in
the
shafts
of
a
dray
that
is
to
say
if
the
dray
was
loaded
so
long
as
it
was
empty
or
the
load
was
light
the
dodger
stepped
out
gaily
but
if
he
found
the
dray
at
all
heavy
he
affected
to
fall
dead
lame
the
old
strain
of
staunch
blood
was
too
strong
in
his
veins
to
allow
him
to
refuse
or
jib
or
stand
still
oh
no
the
dodger
arranged
a
compromise
with
his
conscience
and
though
he
pulled
manfully
he
resorted
to
this
lazy
subterfuge
more
than
once
with
a
new
chum
it
had
succeeded
to
perfection
and
the
dodger
found
himself
back
again
in
his
stable
with
a
rack
of
hay
before
him
whilst
his
deluded
owner
or
driver
was
running
all
over
the
place
to
find
a
substitute
in
the
shafts
if
i
had
not
seen
it
myself
i
could
not
have
believed
it
in
order
to
induce
the
dodger
to
act
his
part
thoroughly
a
drayman
was
appointed
whom
the
horse
had
never
seen
and
therefore
imagined
could
be
easily
imposed
upon
the
moment
the
signal
was
given
to
start
the
dodger
after
a
glance
round
which
plainly
said
i
wonder
if
i
may
try
it
upon
you
took
a
step
forward
and
almost
fell
down
so
desperate
was
his
lameness
the
driver
who
was
well
instructed
in
his
part
ran
round
and
lifted
up
one
sturdy
bay
leg
after
the
other
with
every
appearance
of
the
deepest
concern
this
encouraged
the
dodger
who
uttered
a
groan
but
still
seemed
determined
to
do
his
best
and
limped
and
stumbled
a
yard
or
two
further
on
i
confess
it
seemed
impossible
to
believe
the
horse
to
be
quite
sound
and
if
it
had
depended
on
me
the
dodger
would
instantly
have
been
unharnessed
and
put
back
in
his
stable
but
the
moment
had
come
to
unmask
him
his
master
stepped
forward
and
pulling
first
one
cunning
ear
on
the
alert
for
every
word
and
then
the
other
cried
it
wont
do
sir
step
out
directly
and
do
let
us
have
any
nonsense
the
dodger
groaned
again
this
time
from
his
heart
probably
shook
himself
and
leaning
well
forward
in
his
big
collar
stepped
out
without
a
murmur
the
lameness
had
disappeared
by
magic
nor
was
there
even
the
slightest
return
of
it
until
he
saw
a
new
driver
and
considered
it
safe
to
try
his
dodge
once
more
very
different
was
star
poor
wilful
beauty
whose
name
and
fate
will
long
be
remembered
among
the
green
hills
where
her
short
life
was
passed
born
and
bred
on
the
station
she
was
the
pride
and
joy
of
her
owner
heart
slender
without
being
weedy
compact
without
clumsiness
her
small
head
well
set
on
her
graceful
neck
and
her
fine
legs
with
their
sinews
like
steel
she
attracted
the
envy
of
all
the
neighbouring
squatters
what
will
you
take
for
that
little
grey
filly
when
she
is
broken
was
a
constant
question
she
not
for
sale
her
owner
used
to
answer
i
break
her
myself
and
make
her
as
gentle
as
a
dog
and
she
do
for
my
wife
when
i
get
one
but
this
proved
a
castle
in
the
air
so
far
as
star
was
concerned
the
wife
was
not
so
mythical
in
due
time
appeared
in
that
sheltered
valley
and
standing
at
the
head
of
a
mound
marked
by
a
stake
whereon
a
star
was
rudely
carved
heard
the
story
of
the
poor
creature
fate
from
the
first
week
of
her
life
star
from
a
black
mark
on
her
forehead
showed
signs
of
possessing
a
strange
wild
nature
unlike
her
sire
or
dam
she
evidently
had
a
violent
temper
and
not
to
put
too
fine
a
point
on
it
was
as
vicious
a
grey
mare
as
ever
flung
up
her
heels
in
a
new
zealand
valley
when
her
second
birthday
was
passed
star
education
commenced
the
process
called
gentling
was
a
complete
misnomer
for
the
series
of
buck
jumps
of
bites
and
kicks
with
which
the
young
lady
received
the
slightest
attempt
to
touch
her
she
had
a
horrible
habit
also
of
shrieking
really
almost
like
a
human
being
in
a
frantic
rage
she
would
rush
at
you
with
a
wild
scream
of
fury
and
after
striking
at
you
with
her
front
hoofs
would
wheel
round
like
lightning
and
dash
her
hind
legs
in
your
face
the
stoutest
stockman
declined
to
have
anything
whatever
to
do
with
star
the
most
experienced
breaker
declined
her
with
thanks
generally
adding
a
long
bill
for
repairs
of
rack
and
manger
and
breaking
tackle
and
not
unfrequently
a
hospital
report
of
maimed
and
wounded
stablemen
amateur
horsemen
of
celebrity
arrived
at
the
station
to
look
at
the
beautiful
fiend
and
departed
saying
they
would
rather
not
have
anything
to
say
to
her
at
last
she
was
given
over
in
despair
to
lead
her
own
free
life
never
having
endured
the
indignity
of
bit
or
bridle
for
more
than
two
minutes
months
passed
away
and
star
and
her
tantrums
had
been
nearly
forgotten
when
one
mild
winter
evening
the
stockman
came
in
to
report
that
wonder
of
wonders
star
was
standing
meekly
outside
whinnying
and
as
quiet
as
a
dog
her
master
went
out
to
find
the
man
report
exact
star
walked
straight
up
to
him
and
rubbed
her
soft
nose
confidingly
against
his
sleeve
the
mystery
explained
itself
at
a
glance
she
was
on
the
point
of
having
her
first
foal
and
with
some
strange
and
pathetic
instinct
she
bethought
herself
of
the
kind
hands
whose
caresses
she
had
so
often
rejected
and
came
straight
to
them
for
help
and
succour
her
shy
and
touching
advances
were
warmly
responded
to
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
poor
beast
was
safely
housed
in
the
warm
shed
which
then
represented
the
present
row
of
neat
stables
long
since
on
that
very
spot
a
warm
mash
was
eagerly
swallowed
and
the
stockman
volunteered
to
remain
up
until
all
should
be
happily
over
but
his
courage
failed
him
at
the
sight
of
her
horrible
sufferings
and
in
the
early
dawn
he
came
to
rouse
up
his
master
and
beg
him
to
come
and
see
if
anything
more
could
be
done
there
lay
star
all
her
fierce
spirit
quenched
with
an
appealing
look
in
her
large
black
eyes
which
seemed
positively
human
in
their
capacity
for
expressing
suffering
it
was
many
hours
before
a
dead
foal
was
born
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
if
she
had
been
out
on
the
bleak
hills
the
poor
exhausted
young
mother
must
have
perished
from
weakness
she
appeared
to
understand
thoroughly
the
motive
of
all
that
was
being
done
for
her
and
submitted
with
patience
to
all
the
remedies
gradually
but
slowly
her
strength
returned
and
alas
her
evil
nature
tamed
by
anguish
returned
also
day
by
day
she
became
shyer
of
even
the
hand
which
had
fed
and
succoured
her
and
as
this
is
a
true
chronicle
it
must
be
stated
that
the
very
first
use
star
made
of
her
convalescence
was
to
kick
her
nurse
on
the
leg
break
her
halter
into
fragments
and
gallop
off
to
the
hills
with
a
loud
neigh
of
defiance
whenever
the
topic
of
feminine
ingratitude
came
on
the
carpet
at
that
station
this
which
star
had
done
used
always
to
be
told
as
an
instance
in
point
two
years
later
exactly
the
same
thing
happened
again
the
dreaded
hour
of
suffering
found
the
wayward
beauty
once
more
under
the
roof
which
had
sheltered
her
in
her
former
time
of
trial
and
once
more
she
rested
her
head
in
penitence
and
appeal
against
her
owner
shoulder
who
could
bear
malice
in
the
presence
of
such
dreadful
pain
not
star
owner
certainly
besides
the
home
resources
a
man
on
horseback
was
sent
off
to
fetch
a
famous
veterinary
who
chanced
to
be
staying
at
a
neighbouring
station
and
they
both
returned
before
star
worst
sufferings
began
all
that
skill
and
experience
could
do
was
done
that
night
but
the
morning
light
found
the
poor
little
grey
mare
dying
from
exhaustion
with
another
dead
foal
lying
by
her
side
she
only
lived
a
few
hours
later
in
spite
of
stimulants
and
the
utmost
care
and
died
gently
and
peacefully
with
those
human
hands
whose
lightest
touch
she
had
so
flouted
ministering
tenderly
to
her
great
needs
the
stockman
had
become
so
fond
of
the
wayward
beauty
in
spite
of
her
ingratitude
that
the
only
solace
he
could
find
for
his
regret
at
her
early
death
lay
in
digging
a
deep
grave
for
her
and
carving
the
emblem
of
her
pretty
name
on
the
rude
stake
which
still
marks
the
spot
no
account
of
station
pets
would
be
complete
without
a
brief
allusion
to
my
numerous
and
unsuccessful
attempts
to
rear
merino
lambs
in
the
house
it
never
was
of
any
use
advising
me
to
leave
the
poor
little
creatures
out
on
the
bleak
if
in
the
course
of
my
rambles
after
ferns
or
creepers
i
came
upon
a
dead
ewe
with
her
baby
running
round
and
round
her
how
could
i
turn
my
back
on
the
little
orphan
who
instead
of
bounding
off
up
the
steep
hill
used
to
run
confidingly
up
to
me
and
poke
its
black
muzzle
into
my
hand
as
if
it
would
say
here
is
a
friend
at
last
and
then
merino
lambs
are
so
much
prettier
than
any
i
have
seen
in
england
their
wool
is
as
tightly
screwed
up
in
small
curls
as
any
astracan
fleece
and
from
being
of
so
much
more
active
a
race
they
are
smaller
and
more
compact
than
english
lambs
and
not
so
awkward
and
leggy
a
merino
lamb
of
a
couple
of
hours
old
is
far
better
fitted
to
take
care
of
itself
up
a
mountain
than
a
civilized
and
helpless
lamb
of
a
month
old
besides
these
latter
being
so
weak
about
the
knees
always
i
only
mention
this
not
out
of
any
desire
to
blow
about
our
sheep
but
because
i
want
to
account
for
my
on
the
subject
of
desolate
orphans
the
ewes
scarcely
ever
died
of
disease
unless
by
a
rare
chance
it
happened
to
be
a
very
old
lady
whose
constitution
gave
way
at
last
before
a
severe
winter
we
oftenest
found
that
the
dead
mother
was
a
fine
fat
young
ewe
who
had
slipped
up
on
a
and
could
not
recover
herself
but
had
died
of
exhaustion
and
fatigue
from
her
violent
efforts
to
kick
herself
up
again
if
we
chanced
to
be
in
time
to
rescue
her
by
the
simple
process
of
setting
her
on
her
legs
again
it
would
be
all
right
but
sometimes
the
poor
creature
had
been
cold
and
stiff
for
hours
before
we
found
her
and
her
lamb
had
bleated
itself
hoarse
and
hungry
and
was
as
tame
as
a
pet
dog
now
could
turn
away
from
a
little
helpless
thing
like
that
who
positively
leaped
into
your
arms
and
cuddled
itself
up
in
delight
sucking
vigorously
away
at
your
glove
or
anything
handy
not
i
for
one
though
i
might
as
well
have
left
it
alone
so
far
as
its
ultimate
fate
was
concerned
but
i
always
hoped
for
better
luck
next
time
and
carried
it
off
in
my
arms
the
first
thing
to
be
do
be
on
arrival
at
home
was
to
give
the
starving
little
creature
a
good
meal
out
of
a
and
the
next
to
put
it
to
sleep
in
a
box
of
hay
in
a
warm
corner
of
the
kitchen
what
always
seemed
to
me
so
extraordinary
was
that
the
lambs
one
and
all
preserved
the
most
cheerful
demeanour
ate
and
drank
and
slept
well
and
yet
died
within
a
month
some
lingered
until
quite
four
weeks
had
passed
others
succumbed
to
my
treatment
in
a
week
i
varied
their
food
mixing
oatmeal
with
the
milk
some
i
fed
often
others
seldom
to
some
i
gave
sugar
in
the
milk
others
had
new
milk
there
was
abundance
of
grass
just
outside
the
house
for
them
to
eat
if
they
could
some
did
mumble
feebly
at
it
i
remember
but
the
mortality
continued
uninterrupted
it
must
have
been
very
ridiculous
to
a
visitor
to
see
my
dear
little
snowy
pets
going
down
on
their
front
knees
before
me
and
wagging
their
long
tails
furiously
the
moment
the
was
brought
out
they
were
far
too
sensible
to
do
this
if
my
hands
were
empty
gentle
affectionate
little
creatures
they
used
to
be
wonderfully
though
now
and
then
they
would
wander
through
the
verandah
and
so
into
my
bedroom
where
the
drapery
of
my
afforded
them
endless
amusement
and
occupation
they
gnawed
and
sucked
all
my
daisy
fringe
until
the
first
thing
that
had
to
be
done
when
a
lamb
arrived
at
the
house
was
to
take
off
muslins
and
fringes
from
that
the
only
trimmed
table
in
the
house
often
and
often
of
a
cold
night
for
we
must
remember
that
new
zealand
lambing
used
always
to
come
off
in
winter
we
would
all
become
suddenly
aware
of
a
strong
smell
of
burning
pervading
the
whole
house
which
on
being
traced
to
its
source
was
often
found
to
proceed
from
the
rosette
of
wool
on
the
forehead
of
a
chilly
lamb
the
creature
drew
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
genial
warmth
of
the
kitchen
fire
until
at
last
it
used
to
lean
its
brow
pensively
against
the
red
hot
bars
hence
arose
the
powerful
odour
gradually
filling
the
whole
of
the
little
wooden
house
of
course
i
used
to
rush
to
the
rescue
and
draw
my
bewildered
pet
away
from
the
fatal
warmth
but
not
until
it
had
usually
singed
the
wool
off
down
to
the
bone
and
there
was
often
a
bad
burn
on
its
forehead
as
well
but
still
in
spite
of
stupidity
and
an
insatiable
appetite
i
always
grieved
very
sincerely
for
each
of
my
orphan
lambs
as
it
in
turn
sank
into
its
early
grave
i
used
to
be
well
laughed
at
for
attaching
any
sentiment
to
an
animal
which
had
sunk
so
disgracefully
low
in
the
as
a
new
zealand
lamb
but
the
abundant
supply
of
my
little
pets
never
made
it
easier
for
me
to
lose
the
particular
one
which
i
had
set
my
heart
on
rearing
it
certainly
did
afford
me
some
comfort
to
hear
that
merino
lambs
had
always
been
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
bring
up
like
so
many
pups
by
hand
and
among
all
the
statistics
i
carefully
collected
i
could
only
find
one
instance
of
a
foundling
having
been
reared
indoors
my
informant
tried
to
comfort
me
by
tales
of
the
tyranny
that
stout
and
tame
sheep
exercised
over
the
household
which
had
sheltered
it
but
i
fear
that
the
stories
of
its
delightful
impudence
only
made
me
more
anxious
to
succeed
in
my
own
experiments
among
the
lambs
chapter
xv
a
feathered
pet
no
record
of
those
dear
distant
days
would
be
complete
without
a
short
memoir
of
kitty
she
was
only
a
grey
dorking
hen
but
no
heroine
in
fact
or
fiction
no
lady
rachel
russell
or
ever
exceeded
kitty
in
unswerving
devotion
to
a
beloved
object
or
rather
objects
to
see
kitty
was
to
admire
her
at
least
as
i
saw
her
one
beautiful
spring
evening
in
a
grassy
paddock
on
the
banks
of
the
horarata
we
had
ridden
over
there
to
visit
our
kind
and
friendly
neighbours
the
c
we
had
enjoyed
a
delicious
cup
of
tea
in
the
verandah
which
looked
on
the
whole
range
from
east
to
west
of
the
glorious
southern
alps
their
shining
white
summits
sharply
cut
against
our
own
peculiarly
beautiful
sky
we
had
strolled
round
the
charming
unformal
garden
on
either
sloping
side
of
a
wide
creek
and
had
admired
with
just
a
tinge
of
envy
the
fruits
and
flowers
the
standard
apple
and
rose
trees
the
tangle
of
fern
and
creepers
the
wealth
of
the
old
and
new
worlds
heaped
together
in
floral
profusion
we
had
done
all
this
i
say
and
very
pleasant
we
had
found
it
now
we
were
trying
to
say
goodbye
not
so
easy
a
task
let
me
tell
you
when
there
are
so
many
temptations
to
linger
and
when
you
are
greatly
pressed
to
stay
the
last
device
of
our
hospitable
hostess
to
keep
us
consisted
in
offering
to
show
me
her
now
i
was
a
young
beginner
in
that
line
myself
and
tormented
my
ducks
and
fowls
to
death
by
my
incessant
care
at
least
that
is
the
conclusion
i
have
arrived
at
since
but
at
that
time
i
considered
it
as
necessary
to
look
after
them
as
if
they
had
been
so
many
children
the
consequence
was
as
i
pathetically
complained
to
c
that
my
hens
sat
furiously
for
a
week
and
then
took
to
lingering
outside
where
perpetual
feeding
was
going
on
until
their
eggs
grew
cold
that
my
ducks
neglected
their
offspring
and
allowed
the
rats
to
decimate
them
and
that
every
variety
of
epidemic
and
misfortune
assailed
in
turns
my
unhappy
poultry
yard
kind
c
listened
as
gravely
as
she
could
hinting
gently
that
perhaps
i
took
too
much
trouble
about
them
then
fearing
least
she
might
have
wounded
my
feelings
she
hastened
to
suggest
that
i
should
try
the
introduction
of
a
different
breed
as
a
preliminary
step
to
this
reformation
she
offered
to
bestow
upon
me
one
of
her
best
dorking
hens
it
was
too
tempting
an
offer
to
be
refused
and
i
forthwith
bestowed
my
affections
on
a
beautiful
grey
pullet
whose
dignified
carriage
and
speckled
exterior
bespoke
her
high
lineage
that
kitty
said
c
i
am
so
glad
you
fancy
her
she
is
one
of
my
nicest
young
hens
we
catch
her
for
you
in
a
moment
i
must
pause
to
mention
here
that
it
struck
me
as
being
very
odd
in
new
zealand
the
way
in
which
creature
has
a
name
excepting
always
the
poor
sheep
if
one
sees
a
cock
strutting
proudly
outside
a
shepherd
door
you
are
sure
to
hear
it
is
either
nelson
or
wellington
every
hen
has
a
pet
name
and
answers
to
it
so
have
the
ducks
and
geese
at
least
of
course
dogs
horses
cows
and
bullocks
each
rejoice
in
the
most
inflated
appellations
but
i
do
remember
ever
hearing
ducks
and
fowls
answer
to
their
names
in
any
other
country
but
this
is
only
by
the
way
i
gratefully
and
gladly
accepted
the
transfer
of
the
fair
kitty
and
only
wondered
how
i
was
to
convey
her
to
her
new
home
fifteen
miles
away
kitty
was
soon
caught
and
carried
off
into
the
house
to
be
packed
up
for
her
first
ride
accustomed
as
i
am
to
ridiculous
things
happening
to
me
still
i
never
felt
in
so
absurd
a
position
as
when
having
mounted
helen
who
seemed
in
a
particularly
playful
mood
after
a
good
feed
of
oats
kitty
was
handed
to
me
neatly
tied
up
in
a
with
her
tufted
head
protruding
from
a
hole
in
the
seam
at
the
side
although
very
anxious
to
carry
her
home
immediately
my
heart
died
within
me
at
the
prospect
of
a
long
gallop
on
a
skittish
mare
with
a
plump
dorking
hen
tied
up
in
a
bag
on
my
lap
there
was
no
help
for
it
however
and
i
tried
to
put
my
bravest
face
on
the
matter
the
difficulties
commenced
at
the
very
point
of
departure
for
it
is
not
easy
to
say
farewell
cordially
with
your
hands
full
of
reins
whip
and
poultry
but
it
proved
comparatively
easy
going
whilst
we
only
cantered
over
the
plains
it
was
not
until
the
first
creek
had
been
reached
that
i
really
perceived
what
lay
before
me
helen
distrusted
the
contents
of
the
bag
and
kept
trying
to
look
round
and
see
what
it
contained
and
her
fears
of
something
uncanny
might
well
have
been
confirmed
when
she
took
off
at
her
first
flat
jump
kitty
screamed
or
shrieked
or
whatever
name
best
expresses
her
discordant
and
piercing
yells
i
more
than
suspect
i
shrieked
too
partly
at
the
difficulty
of
keeping
both
kitty
and
helen
in
any
sort
of
order
and
partly
at
my
own
insecurity
no
sooner
had
helen
landed
on
the
other
side
than
she
fled
homewards
as
if
a
tin
kettle
were
tied
to
her
tail
the
speed
at
which
we
dashed
through
the
fragrant
summer
air
completely
took
away
kitty
breath
and
the
poor
creature
appeared
more
dead
than
alive
by
the
time
i
dismounted
trembling
myself
in
every
limb
for
her
safety
as
well
as
my
own
at
the
garden
gate
however
next
morning
brought
a
renewed
delight
in
existence
to
both
kitty
and
me
and
our
night
sleep
had
made
us
forget
our
agitation
and
peril
after
breakfast
i
introduced
her
to
the
poultry
yard
and
she
adapted
herself
to
her
new
home
with
a
tact
and
good
humour
most
edifying
to
behold
months
passed
away
kitty
had
made
herself
a
nest
in
a
place
the
selection
of
which
did
equal
honour
to
her
head
and
heart
and
she
gladdened
my
eyes
one
fine
morning
by
appearing
with
a
lovely
brood
of
chicks
around
her
who
so
proud
as
the
young
mother
she
exhibited
them
to
me
and
after
i
had
duly
admired
them
used
to
carry
them
off
to
a
nursery
of
her
own
which
she
had
established
among
the
tussocks
just
outside
the
stable
door
c
had
impressed
upon
me
that
kitty
could
be
safely
trusted
to
manage
her
own
affairs
no
fear
of
her
dragging
her
fluffy
babies
out
among
the
wet
grass
too
early
in
the
morning
or
losing
them
among
the
flax
bushes
on
the
no
kitty
came
of
a
race
who
were
model
mothers
and
was
to
be
left
to
take
care
of
herself
and
her
chickens
about
a
week
after
kitty
had
first
shown
me
her
large
small
family
a
friend
of
ours
arrived
unexpectedly
to
stop
the
night
next
morning
when
he
was
going
away
he
apologised
for
asking
leave
to
mount
at
the
stables
saying
his
led
horse
was
so
vicious
and
the
one
he
was
riding
so
gay
that
it
was
quite
possible
their
legs
might
find
themselves
within
the
verandah
or
do
some
mischief
to
the
young
shrubs
which
were
the
pride
and
joy
of
my
heart
this
gentleman
rode
beautifully
and
i
used
to
like
to
see
the
courage
and
patience
with
which
he
always
conquered
the
most
unruly
horse
we
will
come
up
to
the
stable
and
see
you
mount
i
cried
seizing
my
hat
of
course
every
one
followed
my
lead
and
it
was
to
the
sound
of
mingled
jeers
and
compliments
that
poor
t
mounted
his
fiery
steed
and
seized
hold
of
the
leading
rein
of
his
but
this
animal
had
no
intention
of
taking
his
departure
with
propriety
or
tranquillity
he
pranced
and
shied
flinging
out
his
heels
as
he
wildly
danced
round
to
every
point
of
the
compass
in
a
circle
gradually
he
drew
t
and
his
chestnut
a
dozen
yards
away
from
the
stable
and
it
was
just
then
that
i
perceived
poor
kitty
sitting
close
under
a
tussock
it
chanced
to
be
the
hour
for
the
chickens
siesta
and
they
were
all
folded
away
beneath
her
ample
brooding
wings
perhaps
the
danger
had
come
too
near
to
be
avoided
before
i
perceived
it
but
at
all
events
my
loud
shriek
of
warning
was
too
late
to
save
the
pretty
crouching
head
from
the
flourish
of
the
glancing
heels
swift
indeed
was
the
blow
for
scarcely
ten
seconds
could
have
passed
between
my
first
glimpse
of
poor
kitty
bright
black
eye
looking
out
with
such
mortal
terror
in
its
expression
from
beneath
the
yellow
tuft
of
grass
and
my
seeing
the
horse
heel
lay
her
head
right
open
the
brave
little
mother
never
dreamed
of
saving
herself
at
the
cost
of
her
nestlings
she
crouched
as
low
as
possible
and
when
the
horse
had
jumped
over
her
i
flew
to
see
if
she
had
escaped
no
there
lay
my
pretty
pet
with
her
wings
still
outspread
and
her
chickens
unhurt
but
she
seemed
dead
her
head
had
been
actually
cut
clean
open
and
i
never
expected
that
she
would
have
lived
a
moment
yet
she
did
i
took
her
at
once
to
the
well
hard
by
and
bound
up
her
split
head
with
my
pocket
handkerchief
keeping
it
well
wetted
with
cold
water
later
on
i
put
forth
all
the
surgical
art
i
possessed
and
dressed
the
wound
in
the
most
scientific
manner
nursing
poor
kitty
tenderly
in
the
kitchen
and
feeding
her
with
my
own
hands
every
two
hours
she
was
for
a
long
time
incapable
of
feeding
herself
and
even
when
all
danger
was
over
required
most
careful
nursing
however
the
end
of
the
story
is
that
she
recovered
entirely
her
bodily
health
but
her
poor
little
brain
remained
clouded
for
ever
she
never
took
any
more
notice
of
her
chickens
who
had
to
be
brought
up
by
hand
and
she
never
mixed
again
with
the
society
of
the
at
night
she
roosted
apart
in
the
coalshed
and
she
never
seemed
to
hear
my
voice
or
distinguish
me
from
others
though
she
was
perfectly
tame
to
everybody
kitty
end
was
very
tragical
she
grew
exceedingly
fat
and
at
last
one
time
when
we
were
all
snowed
up
and
could
not
afford
to
be
sentimental
my
cook
laid
hold
of
poor
kitty
who
was
moping
in
her
usual
corner
and
converted
her
into
a
savoury
stew
without
telling
me
until
i
had
actually
dined
off
her
i
was
very
angry
but
eliza
only
repeated
by
way
of
consolation
she
had
no
wits
only
flesh
consequently
she
was
better
in
my
nor
anywhere
else
mum
if
you
only
look
at
it
calm
like
but
it
was
very
hard
to
be
made
to
eat
one
patient
especially
when
i
was
so
proud
of
the
way
her
poor
head
had
healed
if
anybody
wanted
to
teaze
me
they
suggested
that
i
had
omitted
to
replace
my
dear
kitty
brains
before
closing
that
cruel
wound
in
her
skull
chapter

doctoring
without

so
many
reminiscences
come
crowding
into
my
mind
some
grave
and
others
gay
as
i
sit
down
to
write
these
final
chapters
that
i
hardly
know
where
to
begin
the
most
clamorous
of
the
memories
the
one
which
pushes
its
way
most
vividly
to
the
front
is
of
a
little
amateur
doctoring
of
mine
and
as
my
patient
luckily
did
not
die
of
my
remedies
i
need
not
fear
that
i
shall
be
asked
for
my

shearing
was
just
over
over
only
that
very
evening
in
fact
we
had
been
leading
a
sort
of
uncomfortable
picnic
life
at
the

station
for
more
than
ten
days
and
had
returned
to
our
own
pretty
little
home
up
the
valley
late
on
saturday
night
in
time
for
the
i
have
so
often
described
it
was
my
doing
that
fortnight
picnic
at
the
home
station
and
i
may
as
well
candidly
confess
it
was
a
mistake
although
made
like
most
mistakes
in
life
with
good
intentions
our
partner
had
gone
to
england
our
manager
had
just
left
us
to
set
up
on
his
own
account
and
all
the
responsibility
of
shearing
a
good
many
thousand
sheep
devolved
on
f
and
not
only
the
shearing
the
flock
had
to
be
carefully
draughted
the
ewes
wethers
and
hoggets
to
be
branded
and
turned
out
on
their
several
ranges
the
wethers
for
home
consumption
which
consisted
of
a
flock
of
many
hundred
sheep
turned
into
the
an
enclosure
of
some
five
or
six
hundred
acres
and
various
other
minute
details
to
be
seen
to
the
wool
to
be
sent
down
to
christchurch
and
the
stores
brought
up
by
the
return
drays
my
motives
for
the
plan
i
formed
for
us
to
go
over
bag
and
baggage
to
the
home
station
the
evening
before
the
shearing
began
and
live
there
till
it
was
over
were
varied
we
will
put
the
most
unselfish
first
for
the
sake
of
appearances
i
knew
it
would
be
very
hard
work
for
poor
f
all
that
time
and
i
thought
it
would
add
to
his
fatigue
if
he
had
to
go
backwards
and
forwards
to
his
own
house
every
day
getting
up
at
five
in
the
morning
and
returning
late
at
night
besides
having
no
comfortable
meals
the
next
motive
was
that
i
wanted
very
much
to
see
the
whole
process
of
shearing
and
all
the
rest
of
it
myself
and
as
it
turned
out
though
i
little
dreamed
of
it
at
the
time
this
proved
to
be
my
only
chance
every
body
tried
to
dissuade
me
from
carrying
out
the
scheme
by
urging
that
i
should
be
very
uncomfortable
but
i
did
not
care
in
the
least
for
that
and
insisted
on
being
allowed
at
all
events
to
see
how
i
liked
it
accordingly
one
evening
we
set
forth
such
a
ridiculous
cavalcade
i
would
not
hear
of
riding
for
it
was
only
a
short
two
miles
walk
and
as
we
did
not
start
until
after
our
last
meal
the
sun
had
dipped
behind
tall
peak
and
nearly
the
whole
of
our
happy
valley
lay
in
deep
cool
shadow
besides
which
it
looked
more
like
the
real
thing
to
walk
and
that
was
half
the
battle
with
me
the
real
thing
in
this
case
though
i
did
not
stop
to
explain
it
to
myself
must
have
meant
emigrants
mormons
soldiers
on
the
march
what
you
will
any
thing
which
expresses
all
one
belongings
being
packed
into
a
little
cart
with
a
huge
tin
bath
secured
on
the
top
of
all
such
a
miscellaneous
assortment
of
dry
goods
as
that
cart
held
a
couple
of
mattresses
for
my
courage
failed
me
at
the
idea
of
sleeping
on
chopped
tussocks
for
a
fortnight
a
couple
of
though
as
it
turned
out
one
would
have
been
enough
for
poor
f
never
sat
down
from
the
time
he
got
up
until
he
went
to
bed
again
a
large
hamper
of
provisions
some
books
our
clothes
and
various
little
matters
which
were
indispensable
if
one
had
to
live
in
an
empty
house
for
a
fortnight
i
had
sent
my
two
maids
over
one
morning
a
few
days
before
with
pails
and
mops
and
brushes
and
they
had
given
the
couple
of
rooms
which
we
were
to
inhabit
a
thorough
good
cleaning
and
scouring
so
my
mind
was
easy
on
that
point
it
would
not
have
answered
for
many
reasons
to
have
encumbered
ourselves
with
these
damsels
during
our
stay
at
the
home
station
in
the
first
place
there
was
really
no
accommodation
for
them
in
the
next
it
would
have
entailed
more
luggage
than
the
little
cart
could
hold
and
finally
we
should
have
been
obliged
to
leave
them
behind
at
the
last
moment
for
only
the
evening
before
we
started
a
couple
of
friends
arrived
in
true
new
zealand
fashion
from
christchurch
to
pay
us
a
month
visit
it
was
too
late
to
alter
our
plans
then
so
we
told
them
to
make
themselves
thoroughly
at
home
and
took
our
departure
next
day
in
the
way
i
have
alluded
to
we
had
plenty
of
escort
as
far
as
the
first
swamp
when
that
treacherous
and
spot
had
been
reached
everybody
suddenly
remembered
that
they
had
forgotten
something
or
the
other
which
obliged
them
to
return
directly
so
our
farewells
had
to
be
exchanged
from
the
centre
of
a
flax
bush
the
cart
meanwhile
was
nearly
out
of
sight
so
wide
a
had
its
driver
been
forced
to
make
in
order
to
find
a
place
sound
enough
to
bear
its
weight
but
we
caught
it
up
again
after
we
had
happily
crossed
the
quagmire
which
used
always
to
be
my
and
in
due
time
we
made
our
appearance
in
the
gloaming
at
the
tiny
house
belonging
to
the
home
station
early
as
was
the
hour
not
later
than
eight
the
place
lay
silent
and
still
under
the
balmy
summer
haze
all
the
shearers
were
fast
asleep
in
the
men
hut
whilst
every
available
nook
and
corner
was
filled
with
the
spare
hands
the
musterers
branders
and
many
others
whose
duties
were
far
down
the
flat
we
could
dimly
discern
a
white
patch
the
fleecy
outlines
of
the
large
mob
destined
to
fill
the
skillions
at
morning
and
although
we
could
not
see
them
distinctly
close
by
watchful
and
vigilant
all
through
that
and
many
subsequent
summer
nights
pepper
and
his
two
beautiful
colleys
kept
watch
and
ward
over
the
sheep
writing
in
the
heavy
atmosphere
of
this
vast
london
world
i
look
back
upon
that
and
such
evenings
as
that
with
a
desperate
craving
to
breathe
once
more
he
delicious
air
unsoiled
by
human
lungs
and
stirred
into
fresh
fragrance
by
every
summer
sigh
of
those
distant
new
zealand
valleys
no
wonder
people
were
always
well
in
such
a
pure
clear
light
atmosphere
i
try
to
feel
again
in
fancy
the
exquisite
enjoyment
of
merely
drawing
a
deep
breath
the
thrilling
sensation
of
health
and
strength
it
sent
tingling
down
to
your
finger
ends
no
fleck
or
film
of
vapour
or
miasma
could
be
seen
or
smelt
though
the
day
had
been
burning
hot
and
as
i
have
said
there
were
plenty
of
creeks
and
swamps
hard
by
damp
is
unknown
in
those
valleys
and
we
might
have
lingered
bareheaded
even
after
the
heavy
dew
began
to
fall
without
risk
of
cold
or
fever
or
any
other
ailment
but
we
could
not
afford
to
linger
a
moment
out
of
doors
that
lovely
tempting
evening
f
and
the
driver
of
the
cart
who
had
some
important
part
to
take
in
the
proceedings
i
forget
exactly
what
soon
tossed
out
my
little
stores
which
looked
very
insignificant
as
they
lay
in
a
heap
in
the
verandah
and
departed
to
see
that
all
was
in
train
for
next
day
work
i
had
no
time
to
enjoy
the
evening
soft
beauty
the
beds
had
to
be
made
clothes
to
be
unpacked
and
hung
up
stores
must
be
arranged
on
the
shelves
in
the
for
the
house
only
consisted
of
two
small
rooms
in
front
with
a
wide
verandah
and
a
sort
of
at
the
back
which
was
divided
into
a
small
kitchen
and
this
last
was
empty
i
confess
i
thought
rather
regretfully
of
my
pretty
comfortable
at
the
other
house
with
its
curtains
and
carpet
its
wardrobes
and
when
i
found
myself
surveying
the
scene
of
my
completed
labours
two
station
wooden
of
the
simplest
and
rudest
construction
with
a
sacking
bottom
a
couple
of
empty
boxes
one
for
a
and
the
other
for
a
a
tin
basin
and
a
bucket
of
water
being
the
paraphernalia
of
the
latter
whilst
some
nails
behind
the
door
served
to
hang
our
clothes
on
such
was
my
station
bedroom
and
all
my
own
doing
too
certainly
it
looked
uncomfortable
enough
to
satisfy
any
one
but
i
would
not
have
complained
of
it
for
the
world
lest
i
might
have
been
ordered
home
directly
hard
as
was
my
bed
that
night
i
slept
soundly
and
it
appeared
only
five
minutes
before
i
heard
a
tremendous
noise
outside
the
verandah
the
bleating
of
hundreds
of
sheep
announced
that
the
mob
were
slowly
advancing
before
a
perfect
army
of
men
and
dogs
up
to
the
sheep
yards
what
a
din
they
all
made
f
was
wide
awake
and
up
in
a
moment
i
anxious
to
show
i
had
insisted
on
coming
over
got
up
too
and
made
my
way
into
the
little
kitchen
where
i
found
a
charming
surprise
awaiting
me
in
the
shape
of
some
faggots
of
wood
cut
into
exactly
the
right
lengths
for
the
american
stove
and
also
a
heap
of
dry
menuka
bushes
which
make
the
best
touchwood
for
lighting
fires
in
the
whole
world
the
tiny
kitchen
and
stove
were
both
scrupulously
clean
and
so
were
my
three
saucepans
and
kettle
this
had
been
of
course
my
maids
doing
but
the
fuel
was
a
delicate
little
attention
on
pepper
part
how
he
blushed
and
grinned
with
delight
when
i
thanked
him
before
all
his
mates
this
was
indeed
made
easy
it
did
not
take
two
minutes
to
light
my
fire
and
in
five
more
i
had
a
delicious
cup
of
tea
and
some
all
ready
for
f
it
was
nearly
cold
however
by
the
time
i
could
catch
him
and
make
him
drink
it
of
course
being
a
man
instead
of
saying
thank
you
or
anything
of
that
sort
he
merely
remarked
what
nonsense
but
equally
of
course
he
was
very
glad
to
get
it
and
ate
and
drank
it
all
up
returning
instantly
to
his
shed
after
this
little
episode
i
set
to
work
to
unpack
a
little
and
make
the
look
the
least
bit
more
then
i
laid
the
cloth
for
breakfast
put
out
the
pie
and
potted
meat
etc
no
words
can
say
how
heartily
tired
of
pies
we
both
were
before
the
week
was
over
and
arranged
everything
for
breakfast
then
i
waylaid
one
of
the
numerous
stray
hands
which
hang
about
a
station
at
shearing
time
and
got
him
to
fetch
me
a
couple
of
buckets
of
water
as
far
as
the
verandah
these
i
conveyed
myself
into
the
little
and
finished
my
toilette
at
my
leisure
tidying
it
all
up
afterwards
i
wonder
if
any
one
has
any
idea
what
hot
work
it
is
making
a
bed
so
hot
in
fact
that
i
resolved
in
future
to
be
wise
enough
to
finish
all
these
domestic
occupations
before
i
had
my
bath
the
worst
of
getting
up
so
early
proved
to
be
that
by
nine
i
was
very
tired
and
had
nothing
else
to
do
for
the
remainder
of
the
long
noisy
day
as
for
the
meals
they
were
wretchedly
unsociable
for
f
only
came
in
to
snatch
a
mouthful
or
two
standing
and
it
was
of
little
use
trying
to
make
things
comfortable
for
him
i
must
confess
here
what
i
would
not
acknowledge
at
the
time
that
i
found
it
a
very
long
and
dull
visit
my
husband
never
had
time
to
speak
to
me
and
when
he
did
it
was
only
about
sheep
i
grew
weary
of
living
on
cold
meat
for
it
was
really
too
hot
to
cook
and
my
servants
used
to
send
me
over
every
second
day
cold
fowls
or
pies
besides
one
seemed
to
live
in
a
whirl
and
confusion
of
dust
and
bleating
and
barking
after
the
day
work
was
fairly
over
f
used
to
rush
in
seize
a
big
cry
i
am
off
for
a
bathe
in
the
creek
and
only
return
in
time
for
supper
and
bed
the
weather
was
all
that
a
could
desire
bright
sunny
and
clear
one
lovely
summer
day
followed
another
hot
almost
to
tropical
warmth
without
any
risk
or
fear
of
or
and
a
delicious
lightness
in
the
atmosphere
all
the
time
which
merged
into
a
cool
bracing
air
the
moment
the
sun
had
slowly
travelled
behind
the
high
hills
to
the
westward
but
all
these
details
though
necessary
to
make
you
understand
what
i
had
been
doing
are
not
the
story
itself
so
to
that
we
will
hurry
on
the
shearing
was
over
saturday
evening
had
come
as
welcome
to
poor
imprisoned
me
as
to
any
one
and
the
great
work
of
the
new
zealand
year
had
been
most
successfully
accomplished
f
was
in
such
good
humour
that
he
even
deigned
to
admit
that
his
own
comfort
had
been
somewhat
increased
by
my
living
at
the
home
station
so
i
felt
quite
rewarded
for
my
many
dreary
hours
the
shearers
had
been
paid
and
were
even
then
picking
their
way
over
the
hills
in
little
groups
of
two
and
three
some
i
grieve
to
say
bound
for
the
nearest
or
wayside
inn
and
others
for
the
next
station
across
the
river
where
the
skillions
were
full
and
waiting
for
them
to
begin
on
monday
morning
only
people
instead
of
thirty
were
left
at
our
place
and
there
would
not
even
have
been
so
many
if
it
had
not
been
thought
well
to
keep
a
few
there
until
the
was
empty
generally
it
was
arranged
for
the
to
follow
each
other
every
two
days
with
a
load
down
to
christchurch
for
the
greatest
risk
a
runs
is
from
his
shed
taking
fire
whilst
it
is
full
of
bales
of
wool
this
had
happened
often
enough
in
the
colony
and
even
in
our
neighbourhood
to
make
us
more
and
more
careful
every
year
and
as
i
have
said
amongst
our
precautions
was
that
of
keeping
as
little
wool
as
possible
in
the
shed
most
waited
until
the
shearing
should
be
quite
over
before
they
carted
the
wool
away
but
in
that
case
a
spark
from
a
pipe
a
match
carelessly
dropped
in
a
tussock
outside
when
a
was
blowing
and
the
slight
wooden
building
would
be
blazing
like
a
torch
and
your
year
income
vanishing
in
the
smoke
even
at
the
last
moment
when
the
cart
had
already
started
homewards
with
the
tin
bath
balanced
once
more
on
the
top
of
the
mattresses
and
boxes
when
the
house
was
empty
and
i
was
waiting
my
hat
and
jacket
on
and
in
hand
eager
to
set
out
a
doubt
arose
about
the
expediency
of
our
return
home
some
accidental
delay
had
prevented
the
dray
from
arriving
in
time
to
start
for
christchurch
with
the
last
load
and
between
two
and
three
hundred
pounds
worth
of
wool
still
remained
in
the
shed
packed
and
labelled
indeed
but
neither
insured
nor
protected
from
the
risk
of
fire
in
any
way
f
was
very
loath
to
leave
them
there
but
yielding
to
my
entreaties
he
called
pepper
the
head
shepherd
and
solemnly
gave
the
and
its
contents
over
into
his
charge
with
many
and
many
a
caution
about
fire
pepper
was
as
trustworthy
and
steady
a
shepherd
as
any
in
the
colony
and
promised
to
keep
his
open
as
he
phrased
it
in
nautical
slang
picked
up
from
some
sailor
all
the
way
home
f
said
from
time
to
time
anxiously
i
wish
the
shed
was
empty
but
i
cheered
him
up
and
told
him
he
was
and
unreasonably
nervous
and
so
forth
but
with
a
great
longing
myself
for
monday
morning
to
come
and
for
the
dray
to
take
its
load
and
start
i
need
not
dwell
on
how
delicious
it
was
to
return
home
where
everything
seemed
so
comfortable
and
nice
and
the
bed
felt
especially
soft
and
welcome
to
tired
limbs
early
were
our
hours
you
may
be
sure
and
we
slept
the
sleep
of
the
until
between
two
and
three
the
next
morning
then
we
were
roused
up
by
some
one
knocking
loudly
against
our
latticed
window
i
was
the
first
to
hear
the
noise
and
cried
who
there
what
is
it
all
in
a
breath
the
on
fire
murmured
f
in
a
tone
of
agonized
conviction
it
you
that
wanted
please
mum
this
moment
over
at
the
home
station
i
heard
pepper
say
in
impatient
tones
it
the
repeated
f
more
than
half
asleep
and
with
only
room
for
that
one
idea
in
his
dreamy
mind
nonsense
i
cried
jumping
out
of
bed
i
should
not
be
wanted
if
the
were
on
fire
do
you
hear
pepper
say
he
wants
me
all
right
then
said
f
actually
turning
over
and
proposing
to
go
to
sleep
again
but
there
was
no
more
sleep
for
either
of
us
that
night
whilst
i
hastily
put
on
my
pepper
told
me
through
the
window
an
incoherent
tale
of
some
one
being
at
the
point
of
death
and
wanting
me
to
cure
him
and
the
master
to
bring
over
pen
and
ink
to
make
a
will
and
dying
speeches
and
cold
shivers
all
mixed
up
together
in
a
tangle
of
words
f
took
some
minutes
to
understand
that
it
was
fenwick
a
gigantic
yorkshireman
who
had
been
seized
with
what
pepper
would
call
the
choleraics
and
who
in
spite
of
having
swallowed
all
the
mustard
and
rum
and
left
on
the
premises
grew
worse
and
worse
every
moment
he
dying
safe
enough
concluded
pepper
but
he
main
anxious
to
see
you
mum
and
the
master
and
he
wants
a
bible
brought
to
swear
him
and
he
powerful
uneasy
to
make
his
will
i
knew
quite
as
little
of
medicine
as
my
husband
did
of
law
but
of
course
we
decided
instantly
that
we
ought
both
to
go
and
see
what
could
be
done
in
any
way
to
relieve
either
the
body
or
mind
of
the
sufferer
we
said
to
each
other
while
we
were
hastily
dressing
how
shall
we
ever
catch
the
horses
they
have
all
been
turned
out
of
course
as
no
one
thought
they
would
be
wanted
until
monday
and
who
knows
where
they
have
gone
to
miles
away
perhaps
and
it
pitch
dark
judge
then
of
our
delighted
surprise
when
on
going
out
into
the
verandah
preparatory
to
starting
off
to
look
for
our
steeds
we
found
them
standing
at
the
gate
ready
saddled
and
bridled
it
seemed
like
magic
but
the
good
fairies
in
this
case
had
been
the
two
guests
to
whom
i
have
alluded
as
having
arrived
just
as
we
were
starting
for
our
picnic
life
they
were
both
old
chums
and
understood
the
situation
instantly
whilst
we
were
questioning
pepper
you
can
hear
every
word
all
over
a
new
zealand
house
they
had
jumped
up
huddled
on
their
clothes
and
gone
over
the
brow
of
the
hill
to
look
for
the
horses
by
great
good
fortune
the
whole
mob
was
found
quietly
camping
in
the
sheltered
valley
full
of
sweet
grass
on
its
further
side
to
walk
up
to
my
pretty
bay
mare
helen
and
lay
hold
of
her
mane
and
then
vaulting
on
her
back
ride
the
rest
of
the
mob
back
into
the
stockyard
was
even
in
the
deep
darkness
of
a
midsummer
night
no
difficult
task
for
eyes
so
practised
to
catching
horses
under
all
circumstances
so
here
was
one
obstacle
suddenly
smoothed
and
as
i
hastily
collected
my
few
simple
remedies
consisting
chiefly
of
flannel
chlorodyne
and
brandy
i
could
only
trust
and
pray
that
poor
fenwick
case
might
not
be
so
desperate
as
pepper
represented
it
to
our
impatience
the
difficult
track
with
its
swamps
and
holes
its
creeks
to
be
jumped
and
morasses
to
be
avoided
seemed
long
indeed
but
to
judge
from
the
continued
profound
darkness
that
inky
blackness
of
the
sky
which
is
the
immediate
forerunner
of
daylight
the
dawn
could
not
be
far
off
how
well
i
remember
the
whole
scene
f
tied
his
white
handkerchief
on
his
arm
that
helen
and
i
might
have
a
faint
speck
of
light
by
which
to
guide
ourselves
pepper
rode
close
to
me
pouring
into
my
ears
dismal
predictions
of
fenwick
end
whilst
i
amid
all
my
anxiety
could
only
think
of
the
dangers
of
the
track
and
whether
in
the
pitchy
darkness
we
should
ever
get
to
the
home
station
the
dew
fell
so
heavily
that
more
than
once
i
thought
it
must
be
raining
but
those
were
only
brooding
in
the
great
dark
vault
above
us
more
welcome
than
ever
sounded
the
bark
of
the
dogs
which
told
us
we
had
reached
the
end
of
our
stumbling
ride
and
the
moment
their
tongues
woke
up
the
silence
a
lantern
showed
a
ray
of
light
to
guide
us
to
the
hut
door
i
jumped
off
my
horse
instantly
and
went
in
at
first
i
thought
my
patient
was
dead
for
he
lay
rigid
and
grey
in
his
bunk
at
a
glance
i
perceived
that
nothing
could
really
be
done
to
help
him
whilst
he
was
lying
on
a
high
shelf
almost
out
of
my
reach
in
a
small
hut
filled
with
bewildered
men
who
kept
offering
him
from
time
to
time
a
pull
at
a
particularly
good
pipe
having
previously
poured
all
the
grog
they
could
muster
down
his
throat
or
rather
over
his
pillow
his
saddle
performed
that
duty
by
night
for
he
had
been
unable
to
swallow
for
some
hours
i
remembered
that
there
were
the
bedsteads
we
had
used
at
the
house
and
also
some
firewood
still
left
in
the
kitchen
explaining
to
pepper
how
he
was
to
wrap
poor
fenwick
in
every
available
blanket
in
the
place
and
carry
him
across
the
open
space
into
the
parlour
i
hastily
ran
on
before
got
some
one
to
help
me
to
drag
one
of
the
light
frames
into
the
laced
it
before
the
fireplace
and
then
made
up
a
good
blazing
fire
on
the
open
hearth
by
the
time
the
dry
wood
was
crackling
and
sparkling
out
its
cheery
welcome
my
patient
arrived
and
was
laid
down
blankets
and
all
on
the
rude
little
bedstead
before
the
blaze
by
its
fitful
and
uncertain
light
i
proceeded
to
examine
the
enormous
frame
stretched
so
helplessly
before
me
feeling
half
afraid
to
touch
him
at
all
f
was
very
trying
as
an
assistant
for
he
looked
on
without
making
any
suggestions
and
only
said
from
time
to
time
take
care
the
man
is
dead
to
my
inexperienced
eyes
he
indeed
seemed
past
all
human
help
his
skin
was
icy
cold
and
as
wet
as
if
he
had
been
lying
out
in
the
dew
no
flutter
of
pulse
nor
sign
of
breath
could
my
trembling
efforts
discover
but
i
fancied
there
was
the
least
little
sign
of
pulsation
about
his
heart
of
course
i
had
not
the
vaguest
notion
of
what
was
the
matter
with
the
man
for
all
pepper
could
tell
me
was
that
fenwick
been
powerful
bad
you
bet
this
does
not
sound
a
minute
diagnosis
to
go
on
and
the
only
remedies
which
presented
themselves
to
my
mind
were
those
i
had
studied
as
being
useful
for
the
recovery
of
drowned
persons
so
to
work
i
set
as
if
the
poor
fellow
had
just
been
fished
out
of
the
creek
and
whenever
any
one
wanted
to
teaze
me
afterwards
they
would
declare
i
had
insisted
on
fenwick
being
held
up
by
his
heels
but
of
course
that
was
all
nonsense
what
i
did
really
do
was
this
and
a
doctor
in
christchurch
whom
i
afterwards
consulted
as
to
my
treatment
assured
me
laughingly
that
it
was
capital
i
made
pepper
and
another
man
both
rub
the
cold
clammy
body
as
hard
as
they
could
with
mustard
and
hot
flannel
i
got
some
bottles
filled
with
hot
water
for
it
did
not
take
five
minutes
to
boil
the
kettle
and
placed
to
his
feet
and
under
his
arms
then
i
mixed
a
little
very
strong
and
hot
brandy
and
water
to
which
i
added
a
few
drops
of
chlorodyne
and
gave
him
a
teaspoonful
every
five
minutes
for
the
first
there
was
no
sign
of
life
to
be
detected
and
the
same
horrible
bluish
pallor
made
poor
fenwick
really
handsome
face
look
ghastly
in
the
flickering
light
my
two
assistants
were
getting
exhausted
and
pepper
had
more
than
once
murmured
with
the
recollection
of
the
past
fortnight
work
strong
upon
him
spell
oh
or
else
shears
note
the
shearer
demand
for
a
few
minutes
rest
whilst
his
companion
inquired
pathetically
what
was
the
use
of
flaying
a
dead
man
to
these
hints
i
paid
no
attention
though
my
damp
riding
habit
was
steaming
from
the
heat
of
the
fire
and
i
felt
dreadfully
tired
for
certainly
there
seemed
to
my
eyes
a
healthier
tinge
stealing
over
the
rigid
features
and
it
could
not
be
my
fancy
which
detected
a
stronger
effort
to
swallow
the
last
spoonful
of
brandy
i
need
not
go
into
the
details
of
my
remedies
probably
i
should
bring
upon
myself
serious
remonstrances
from
the
royal
humane
society
if
my
treatment
of
that
unhappy
man
were
made
public
it
is
enough
to
say
that
i
exhibited
mustard
by
the
pound
and
brandy
by
the
quart
that
i
roasted
him
first
on
one
side
and
then
on
the
other
that
his
true
skin
was
rubbed
off
that
i
chlorodyned
him
until
he
slept
for
nearly
a
week
and
that
when
he
finally
recovered
he
declared
he
felt
as
if
he
been
dead
and
no
wonder
as
pepper
always
remarked
the
only
clue
i
could
get
to
the
cause
of
his
illness
was
a
shy
confession
about
a
week
afterwards
that
he
had
eaten
a
few
mushrooms
idea
of
a
few
of
anything
was
generally
a
liberal
notion
i
questioned
him
narrowly
as
to
what
he
had
had
for
supper
the
night
he
was
taken
ill
and
this
was
his
bill
of
fare
well
you
see
mum
i
was
rightly
hungry
it
must
have
been
them
gripses
coming
on
so
i
only
had
a
shoulder
of
mutton
when
fenwick
had
really
a
good
appetite
he
regarded
anything
less
than
a
whole
leg
of
a
sheep
as
an
insult
that
night
slap
jacks
and
a
trifle
of
mushrooms
how
big
were
the
mushrooms
i
asked
oh
they
was
rather
fine
ones
mum
i
wo
deny
they
might
have
been
the
bigness
of
a
plate
now
even
supposing
them
to
have
been
perfectly
wholesome
a
few
dozen
mushrooms
of
that
size
eaten
half
raw
with
a
whole
shoulder
of
mutton
are
quite
enough
to
my
ignorant
mind
to
account
for
so
severe
a
fit
of
the
choleraics
chapter
xvii
odds
and
ends
my
nerves
had
hardly
recovered
the
shock
of
having
the
care
of
such
a
huge
patient
thrust
on
me
for
seriously
speaking
fenwick
took
a
good
deal
of
nursing
and
attention
before
he
got
well
again
when
we
had
another
night
alarm
our
beautiful
summer
weather
was
breaking
up
high
had
blown
down
the
gorges
for
days
and
now
a
cold
wet
gale
was
coming
up
in
heavy
banks
of
fleecy
clouds
from
the
everything
looked
cold
and
wretched
out
of
doors
but
the
were
thankful
and
pleased
their
mobs
could
find
excellent
shelter
for
themselves
for
it
takes
bad
weather
to
hurt
a
merino
sheep
and
the
creeks
had
been
running
rather
low
we
shall
have
a
splendid
autumn
after
this
is
over
said
all
the
squatters
gleefully
with
lots
of
feed
there
tyler
creek
coming
down
beautifully
so
i
was
fain
to
be
content
though
my
fowls
looked
draggled
and
wretched
and
my
pet
patch
of
mignonette
became
a
miniature
desert
its
fragrance
being
all
blown
and
away
good
fires
of
lignite
and
wood
made
the
house
cheery
and
we
went
to
bed
hoping
for
fine
weather
next
day
in
the
middle
of
the
night
everyone
was
awakened
by
a
tremendous
echoing
noise
outside
whilst
the
frail
wooden
house
vibrated
perceptibly
it
could
not
be
caused
by
the
wind
for
although
the
rain
kept
pouring
steadily
down
the
furious
gusts
had
long
ago
been
beaten
into
a
sullen
silence
by
the
descending
torrents
for
a
moment
and
an
old
tropical
reminiscence
floated
through
my
sleepy
startled
mind
can
it
be
an
earthquake
i
dreamily
wondered
but
no
earthquake
of
my
acquaintance
was
ever
yet
so
resounding
and
noisy
for
all
its
crumbling
horror
yet
the
house
was
certainly
shaking
what
is
it
what
are
you
doing
rang
in
shouts
through
the
little
dwelling
as
its
dwellers
came
thronging
one
after
another
to
our
door
frightened
as
i
was
i
can
perfectly
remember
how
indignant
i
felt
when
it
became
clear
to
my
mind
that
they
all
thought
were
making
such
an
uproar
how
could
we
do
it
if
even
we
had
wished
to
get
out
of
our
warm
beds
and
create
a
disturbance
on
such
a
wild
night
good
gracious
the
house
is
coming
down
i
cried
as
a
fresh
shudder
ran
through
the
slight
framework
of
our
little
wooden
home
pray
go
out
and
see
what
is
the
matter
thus
urged
f
opened
a
casement
on
the
sheltered
side
if
any
side
could
be
said
to
be
sheltered
in
such
weather
and
cautiously
put
his
head
out
i
peered
over
his
shoulder
and
never
can
i
forget
the
ridiculous
sight
which
met
our
eyes
there
dripping
and
forlorn
huddled
together
under
the
wide
roof
of
our
summer
parlour
as
the
verandah
used
to
be
often
called
the
whole
mob
of
horses
had
gathered
themselves
the
garden
gate
chanced
to
have
been
left
open
and
evidently
under
old
jack
guidance
they
had
all
walked
into
the
verandah
wandered
disconsolately
up
and
down
its
boarded
floor
and
after
partaking
of
a
slight
refreshment
in
the
shape
of
my
best
creepers
had
proceeded
to
make
themselves
at
home
by
rubbing
their
wet
sides
against
the
pillars
and
the
wooden
sides
of
the
house
itself
no
wonder
the
noise
had
aroused
us
all
ironshod
hoofs
clattering
up
and
down
a
boarded
verandah
is
riot
a
silent
performance
and
jack
was
so
cool
and
impudent
about
it
positively
refusing
to
stir
from
the
sheltered
corner
by
the
aviary
which
he
had
chosen
for
himself
the
other
horses
evidently
felt
they
were
intruders
and
were
glad
enough
on
the
flapping
of
a
handkerchief
to
hurry
out
of
their
impromptu
stables
making
the
best
of
their
way
through
the
narrow
garden
gate
and
so
out
upon
the
bleak
hills
again
but
jack
conduct
was
very
trying
he
found
himself
perfectly
comfortable
and
evidently
intended
to
remain
so
neither
for
wishing
nor
coaxing
for
fair
words
nor
foul
would
he
stir
it
seemed
so
horrid
to
have
to
dress
and
go
out
in
such
a
downpour
of
rain
that
we
weakly
deliberated
on
the
expediency
of
letting
the
cunning
old
remain
but
fortunately
at
that
moment
he
began
to
scratch
his
ear
with
his
hind
foot
waking
up
a
thousand
echoes
against
the
side
of
the
house
as
he
did
so
and
making
the
pictures
dance
again
on
the
canvas
and
paper
walls
this
will
never
do
cried
we
all
desperately
he
sure
must
be
taken
to
the
stable
or
he
come
back
again
that
was
exactly
what
jack
meant
and
wanted
so
to
the
stable
he
went
under
poor
shivering
u
guidance
and
the
old
rogue
spent
a
dry
warm
night
under
its
roof
it
was
the
more
absurd
jack
pretending
to
be
afraid
of
a
wet
night
when
he
had
walked
many
and
many
a
weary
mile
over
the
rough
mountain
passes
towards
the
with
a
heavy
pack
on
his
back
and
in
all
sorts
of
weather
a
tradition
existed
in
our
neighbourhood
that
jack
had
once
been
met
crossing
the
amuri
downs
with
a
small
an
american
cooking
stove
and
a
sow
with
a
litter
of
young
ones
all
packed
on
his
back
and
stepping
out
bravely
under
them
all
as
my
informant
added
but
i
can
not
vouch
for
the
truth
of
the
items
of
this
load
jack
fame
as
a
as
well
as
a
stood
high
in
the
malvern
hills
but
his
conduct
in
the
shafts
was
eccentric
to
say
the
least
of
it
he
could
not
bear
to
be
guided
by
his
driver
and
was
always
squinting
over
his
blinkers
in
the
most
ridiculous
manner
if
he
perceived
a
mob
of
cattle
or
horses
on
a
distant
flat
he
would
set
off
to
have
a
look
at
them
and
determine
whether
they
were
strangers
or
friends
dragging
the
gig
after
him
over
bank
bush
and
scaur
once
when
we
were
in
great
despair
for
a
jack
was
elected
to
the
post
but
long
before
we
had
come
to
the
journey
end
we
regretted
our
choice
it
was
during
the
first
summer
of
my
life
in
the
malvern
hills
and
whilst
the
were
still
steadily
setting
their
breezy
faces
against
such
a
new
fangled
idea
as
a
lawn
i
had
wearied
of
sowing
grass
seed
at
a
guinea
a
bag
long
before
those
extremely
rude
zephyrs
got
tired
of
blowing
it
all
out
of
the
ground
there
was
my
beautiful
set
of
croquet
fresh
from
jacques
lying
idle
in
its
box
in
the
verandah
and
there
was
my
charming
friend
alice
s
longing
for
a
game
of
croquet
when
pretty
young
ladies
wish
for
anything
very
much
and
the
house
is
full
of
gentlemen
it
goes
hard
but
that
they
get
the
desire
of
their
innocent
hearts
so
it
was
in
this
case
one
fine
afternoon
alice
wandered
into
the
verandah
and
peeped
for
the
hundredth
time
into
the
box
what
beautiful
things
she
sighed
and
how
hard
it
is
we
ca
have
a
game
i
know
a
patch
of
grass
sang
one
of
the
party
whereon
we
might
play
a
game
where
oh
where
we
asked
in
eager
chorus
about
two
miles
from
this
near
a
deserted
shepherd
hut
it
is
as
thick
and
soft
as
green
velvet
and
the
sheep
keep
it
quite
short
is
the
ground
level
we
inquired
as
flat
as
this
table
was
the
satisfactory
answer
of
course
we
wanted
to
start
immediately
but
how
were
we
to
get
the
croquet
things
there
to
say
nothing
of
the
delightful
excuse
for
tea
out
of
doors
which
immediately
presented
itself
to
my
mind
a
dray
was
suggested
carriages
we
had
none
there
being
no
roads
for
them
if
we
had
possessed
such
vehicles
but
alas
and
alas
the
proper
dray
and
driver
and
horse
were
all
away
on
an
expedition
up
a
distant
gulley
getting
out
some
for
fires
there
jack
some
one
said
doubtfully
he
had
never
even
drawn
a
dray
in
his
life
so
far
as
we
knew
but
at
the
same
time
we
felt
sure
that
when
once
jack
understood
what
was
required
of
him
he
would
do
his
best
to
help
us
to
get
to
our
croquet
ground
so
we
flew
off
to
our
different
duties
alice
to
see
that
the
balls
hoops
and
mallets
were
all
right
in
numbers
and
colours
i
to
pack
a
large
open
basket
with
the
materials
for
my
favourite
form
of
dissipation
an
tea
and
the
gentlemen
to
catch
jack
and
harness
him
into
the
cart
peals
of
laughter
announced
the
setting
forth
of
the
expedition
and
no
wonder
inside
the
dray
which
was
a
very
light
and
crazy
old
affair
was
seated
alice
on
an
empty
by
her
side
i
crouched
on
an
old
sugar
bag
one
of
my
arms
keeping
tight
hold
of
my
beloved
with
its
jingling
contents
whilst
the
other
was
desperately
clutching
at
the
side
of
the
dray
on
a
board
across
the
front
three
gentlemen
were
perched
each
wanting
to
drive
exactly
like
so
many
small
children
in
a
goat
carriage
and
like
them
one
holding
the
reins
the
other
the
whip
and
the
third
giving
good
advice
in
the
shafts
stood
poor
shaggy
old
jack
looking
over
his
blinkers
as
much
as
to
say
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
now
our
good
humoured
and
stalwart
cadet
u
walked
backwards
holding
out
a
carrot
and
calling
jack
to
come
and
eat
it
in
this
extraordinary
fashion
we
proceeded
down
the
flat
for
two
or
three
hundred
yards
one
carrot
succeeding
the
other
in
jack
jaws
rapidly
u
was
just
beginning
to
say
look
here
do
you
think
we
ought
to
take
turns
at
this
when
jack
caught
sight
of
a
creek
right
before
him
he
only
knew
of
one
way
of
crossing
such
obstacles
and
that
was
to
jump
them
no
one
calculated
on
the
sudden
rush
and
high
bound
into
the
air
with
which
he
triumphantly
cleared
the
water
knocking
u
over
and
scattering
his
three
drivers
like
summer
leaves
on
the
track
as
for
alice
and
me
the
inside
passengers
we
found
the
sensation
of
jumping
a
creek
in
a
dray
most
unpleasant
all
the
croquet
balls
leapt
wildly
up
into
the
air
to
fall
like
a
wooden
hailstorm
around
us
the
mallets
and
hoops
bruised
us
from
our
head
to
our
feet
and
the
contents
of
my
basket
were
utterly
ruined
not
only
had
my
and
saucers
come
together
in
one
grand
smash
but
the
kettle
broke
the
bottle
of
cream
which
in
its
turn
absorbed
all
the
sugar
jack
looked
coolly
round
at
us
with
an
air
of
mild
satisfaction
as
if
he
thought
he
had
done
something
very
clever
whilst
our
shrieks
were
rending
the
air
what
a
merry
time
of
one
life
was
that
we
all
had
to
work
hard
and
our
amusements
were
so
simple
and
arcadian
that
i
often
wonder
if
they
really
did
amuse
us
so
much
as
we
thought
they
did
at
the
moment
let
all
new
zealanders
who
doubt
this
look
into
those
perhaps
closed
chapters
of
their
lives
and
as
memory
turns
over
the
leaves
one
by
one
and
pictures
like
the
sketches
i
try
to
reproduce
in
pen
and
ink
grow
into
distinctness
out
of
the
dim
past
it
will
indeed
surprise
me
very
much
if
they
do
not
say
as
i
do
my
pleasant
task
ended
ah
those
were
happy
days
indeed
