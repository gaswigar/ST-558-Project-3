homiletic
dear
friends
i
am
beginning
a
new
book
like
an
old
sermon
but
as
you
know
i
have
been
so
accustomed
to
preach
all
my
life
that
whatever
i
say
or
write
will
more
or
less
take
the
shape
of
a
sermon
and
if
you
had
not
by
this
time
learned
at
least
to
bear
with
my
oddities
you
would
not
have
wanted
any
more
of
my
teaching
and
indeed
i
did
not
think
you
would
want
any
more
i
thought
i
had
bidden
you
farewell
but
i
am
seated
once
again
at
my
to
write
for
you
with
a
strange
feeling
however
that
i
am
in
the
heart
of
some
curious
rather
awful
acoustic
contrivance
by
means
of
which
the
words
which
i
have
a
habit
of
whispering
over
to
myself
as
i
write
them
are
heard
aloud
by
multitudes
of
people
whom
i
can
not
see
or
hear
i
will
favour
the
fancy
that
by
a
sense
of
your
presence
i
may
speak
the
more
truly
as
man
to
man
but
let
me
for
a
moment
suppose
that
i
am
your
grandfather
and
that
you
have
all
come
to
beg
for
a
story
and
that
therefore
as
usually
happens
in
such
cases
i
am
sitting
with
a
puzzled
face
indicating
a
more
puzzled
mind
i
know
that
there
are
a
great
many
stories
in
the
holes
and
corners
of
my
brain
indeed
here
is
one
there
is
one
peeping
out
at
me
like
a
rabbit
but
alas
like
a
rabbit
showing
me
almost
at
the
same
instant
the
of
it
and
vanishing
with
a
contemptuous
of
its
hind
feet
on
the
ground
for
i
must
have
suitable
regard
to
the
desires
of
my
children
it
is
a
fine
thing
to
be
able
to
give
people
what
they
want
if
at
the
same
time
you
can
give
them
what
you
want
to
give
people
what
they
want
would
sometimes
be
to
give
them
only
dirt
and
poison
to
give
them
what
you
want
might
be
to
set
before
them
something
of
which
they
could
not
eat
a
mouthful
what
both
you
and
i
want
i
am
willing
to
think
is
a
dish
of
good
wholesome
venison
now
i
suppose
my
children
around
me
are
neither
young
enough
nor
old
enough
to
care
about
a
fairy
tale
go
that
will
not
do
what
they
want
is
i
believe
something
that
i
know
about
that
has
happened
to
myself
well
i
confess
that
is
the
kind
of
thing
i
like
best
to
hear
anybody
talk
to
me
about
let
anyone
tell
me
something
that
has
happened
to
himself
especially
if
he
will
give
me
a
peep
into
how
his
heart
took
it
as
it
sat
in
its
own
little
room
with
the
closed
door
and
that
person
will
so
telling
absorb
my
attention
he
has
something
true
and
genuine
and
valuable
to
communicate
they
are
mostly
old
people
that
can
do
so
not
that
young
people
have
nothing
happen
to
them
but
that
only
when
they
grow
old
are
they
able
to
see
things
right
to
disentangle
confusions
and
judge
righteous
judgment
things
which
at
the
time
appeared
insignificant
or
wearisome
then
give
out
the
light
that
was
in
them
show
their
own
truth
interest
and
influence
they
are
far
enough
off
to
be
seen
it
is
not
when
we
are
nearest
to
anything
that
we
know
best
what
it
is
how
i
should
like
to
write
a
story
for
old
people
the
young
are
always
having
stories
written
for
them
why
should
not
the
old
people
come
in
for
a
share
a
story
without
a
young
person
in
it
at
all
nobody
under
fifty
admitted
it
could
hardly
be
a
fairy
tale
could
it
or
a
love
story
either
i
am
not
so
sure
about
that
the
worst
of
it
would
be
however
that
hardly
a
young
person
would
read
it
now
we
old
people
would
not
like
that
we
can
read
young
people
s
books
and
enjoy
them
they
would
not
try
to
read
old
men
s
books
or
old
women
s
books
they
would
be
so
sure
of
their
being
dry
my
dear
old
brothers
and
sisters
we
know
better
do
we
not
we
have
nice
old
jokes
with
no
end
of
fun
in
them
only
they
can
not
see
the
fun
we
have
strange
tales
that
we
know
to
be
true
and
which
look
more
and
more
marvellous
every
time
we
turn
them
over
again
only
somehow
they
do
not
belong
to
the
ways
of
this
year
i
was
going
to
say
and
so
the
young
people
generally
do
not
care
to
hear
them
i
have
had
one
boy
to
be
sure
who
will
sit
at
his
mother
s
feet
and
listen
for
hours
to
what
took
place
before
he
was
born
to
him
his
mother
s
was
as
old
as
eve
s
coat
of
skins
but
then
he
was
young
enough
not
yet
to
have
had
a
chance
of
losing
the
childhood
common
to
the
young
and
the
old
ah
i
should
like
to
write
for
you
old
men
old
women
to
help
you
to
read
the
past
to
help
you
to
look
for
the
future
now
is
your
salvation
nearer
than
when
you
believed
for
however
your
souls
may
be
at
peace
however
your
quietness
and
confidence
may
give
you
strength
in
the
decay
of
your
earthly
tabernacle
in
the
shortening
of
its
cords
in
the
weakening
of
its
stakes
in
the
rents
through
which
you
see
the
stars
you
have
yet
your
share
in
the
cry
of
the
creation
after
the
sonship
but
the
one
thing
i
should
keep
saying
to
you
my
companions
in
old
age
would
be
friends
let
us
not
grow
old
age
is
but
a
mask
let
us
not
call
the
mask
the
face
is
the
acorn
old
because
its
cup
dries
and
drops
it
from
its
hold
because
its
skin
has
grown
brown
and
cracks
in
the
earth
then
only
is
a
man
growing
old
when
he
ceases
to
have
sympathy
with
the
young
that
is
a
sign
that
his
heart
has
begun
to
wither
and
that
is
a
dreadful
kind
of
old
age
the
heart
needs
never
be
old
indeed
it
should
always
be
growing
younger
some
of
us
feel
younger
do
we
not
than
when
we
were
nine
or
ten
it
is
not
necessary
to
be
able
to
play
at
leapfrog
to
enjoy
the
game
there
are
young
creatures
whose
turn
it
is
and
perhaps
whose
duty
it
would
be
to
play
at
if
there
was
any
necessity
for
putting
the
matter
in
that
light
and
for
us
we
have
the
privilege
or
if
we
will
not
accept
the
privilege
then
i
say
we
have
the
duty
of
enjoying
their
but
if
we
must
withdraw
in
a
measure
from
sociable
relations
with
our
fellows
let
it
be
as
the
wise
creatures
that
creep
aside
and
wrap
themselves
up
and
lay
themselves
by
that
their
wings
may
grow
and
put
on
the
lovely
hues
of
their
coming
resurrection
such
a
withdrawing
is
in
the
name
of
youth
and
while
it
is
pleasant
no
one
knows
how
pleasant
except
him
who
experiences
it
to
sit
apart
and
see
the
drama
of
life
going
on
around
him
while
his
feelings
are
calm
and
free
his
vision
clear
and
his
judgment
righteous
the
old
man
must
ever
be
ready
should
the
sweep
of
action
catch
him
in
its
skirts
to
get
on
his
tottering
old
legs
and
go
with
brave
heart
to
do
the
work
of
a
true
man
none
the
less
true
that
his
hands
tremble
and
that
he
would
gladly
return
to
his
if
he
is
never
thus
called
out
let
him
examine
himself
lest
he
should
be
falling
into
the
number
of
those
that
say
i
go
sir
and
go
not
who
are
content
with
thinking
beautiful
things
in
an
atlantis
oceana
arcadia
or
what
it
may
be
but
put
not
forth
one
of
their
fingers
to
work
a
salvation
in
the
earth
better
than
such
is
the
man
who
using
just
weights
and
a
true
balance
sells
good
flour
and
never
has
a
thought
of
his
own
i
have
been
talking
to
my
reader
is
it
or
to
my
supposed
group
of
grandchildren
i
remember
to
my
companions
in
old
age
it
is
time
i
returned
to
the
company
who
are
hearing
my
whispers
at
the
other
side
of
the
great
thundering
gallery
i
take
leave
of
my
old
friends
with
one
word
we
have
yet
a
work
to
do
my
friends
but
a
work
we
shall
never
do
aright
after
ceasing
to
understand
the
new
generation
we
are
not
the
men
neither
shall
wisdom
die
with
us
the
lord
hath
not
forsaken
his
people
because
the
young
ones
do
not
think
just
as
the
old
ones
choose
the
lord
has
something
fresh
to
tell
them
and
is
getting
them
ready
to
receive
his
message
when
we
are
out
of
sympathy
with
the
young
then
i
think
our
work
in
this
world
is
over
it
might
end
more
honourably
now
readers
in
general
i
have
had
time
to
consider
what
to
tell
you
about
and
how
to
begin
my
story
will
be
rather
about
my
family
than
myself
now
i
was
as
it
were
a
little
withdrawn
even
by
the
time
of
which
i
am
about
to
write
i
had
settled
into
a
quite
elderly
yet
active
man
young
still
in
fact
to
what
i
am
now
but
even
then
though
my
faith
had
grown
stronger
life
had
grown
sadder
and
needed
all
my
stronger
faith
for
the
vanishing
of
beloved
faces
and
the
trials
of
them
that
are
dear
will
make
even
those
that
look
for
a
better
country
both
for
themselves
and
their
friends
sad
though
it
will
be
with
a
preponderance
of
the
first
meaning
of
the
word
which
was
i
am
again
seated
in
the
little
octagonal
room
which
i
have
made
my
study
because
i
like
it
best
it
is
rather
a
shame
for
my
books
cover
over
every
foot
of
the
old
oak
panelling
but
they
make
the
room
all
the
pleasanter
to
the
eye
and
after
i
am
gone
there
is
the
old
oak
none
the
worse
for
anyone
who
prefers
it
to
books
i
intend
to
use
as
the
central
portion
of
my
present
narrative
the
history
of
a
year
during
part
of
which
i
took
charge
of
a
friend
s
parish
while
my
thomas
weir
who
was
and
is
still
my
curate
took
the
entire
charge
of
marshmallows
what
led
to
this
will
soon
appear
i
will
try
to
be
minute
enough
in
my
narrative
to
make
my
story
interesting
although
it
will
cost
me
suffering
to
recall
some
of
the
incidents
i
have
to
narrate
chapter
ii
constance
s
birthday
was
it
from
observation
of
nature
in
its
association
with
human
nature
or
from
artistic
feeling
alone
that
shakspere
so
often
represents
nature
s
mood
as
in
harmony
with
the
mood
of
the
principal
actors
in
his
drama
i
know
i
have
so
often
found
nature
s
mood
in
harmony
with
my
own
even
when
she
had
nothing
to
do
with
forming
mine
that
in
looking
back
i
have
wondered
at
the
fact
there
may
however
be
some
about
it
at
all
events
on
the
morning
of
my
constance
s
eighteenth
birthday
a
lovely
october
day
with
a
golden
east
clouds
of
golden
foliage
about
the
ways
and
an
air
that
seemed
filled
with
the
ether
of
an
there
came
yet
an
occasional
blast
of
wind
which
without
being
absolutely
cold
smelt
of
winter
and
made
one
draw
one
s
shoulders
together
with
the
sense
of
an
unfriendly
presence
i
do
not
think
constance
felt
it
at
all
however
as
she
stood
on
the
steps
in
her
waiting
till
the
horses
made
their
appearance
it
had
somehow
grown
into
a
custom
with
us
that
each
of
the
children
as
his
or
her
birthday
came
round
should
be
king
or
queen
for
that
day
and
subject
to
the
veto
of
father
and
mother
should
have
everything
his
or
her
own
way
let
me
say
for
them
however
that
in
the
matter
of
choosing
the
dinner
which
of
course
was
included
in
the
royal
prerogative
i
came
to
see
that
it
was
almost
invariably
the
favourite
dishes
of
others
of
the
family
that
were
chosen
and
not
those
especially
agreeable
to
the
royal
palate
members
of
families
where
children
have
not
been
taught
from
their
earliest
years
that
the
great
privilege
of
possession
is
the
right
to
bestow
may
regard
this
as
an
improbable
assertion
but
others
will
know
that
it
might
well
enough
be
true
even
if
i
did
not
say
that
so
it
was
but
there
was
always
the
choice
of
some
individual
treat
which
was
determined
solely
by
the
preference
of
the
individual
in
authority
constance
had
chosen
a
long
ride
with
i
suppose
a
parent
may
sometimes
be
right
when
he
speaks
with
admiration
of
his
own
children
the
probability
of
his
being
correct
is
to
be
determined
by
the
amount
of
capacity
he
has
for
admiring
other
people
s
children
however
this
may
be
in
my
own
case
i
venture
to
assert
that
constance
did
look
very
lovely
that
morning
she
was
fresh
as
the
young
day
we
were
early
people
breakfast
and
prayers
were
over
and
it
was
nine
o
clock
as
she
stood
on
the
steps
and
i
approached
her
from
the
lawn
o
papa
isn
t
it
jolly
she
said
merrily
very
jolly
indeed
my
dear
i
answered
delighted
to
hear
the
word
from
the
lips
of
my
gentle
daughter
she
very
seldom
used
a
slang
word
and
when
she
did
she
used
it
like
a
lady
shall
i
tell
you
what
she
was
like
ah
you
could
not
see
her
as
i
saw
her
that
morning
if
i
did
i
will
however
try
to
give
you
a
general
idea
just
in
order
that
you
and
i
should
not
be
picturing
to
ourselves
two
very
different
persons
while
i
speak
of
her
she
was
rather
little
and
so
slight
that
she
looked
tall
i
have
often
observed
that
the
impression
of
height
is
an
affair
of
proportion
and
has
nothing
to
do
with
feet
and
inches
she
was
rather
fair
in
complexion
with
her
mother
s
blue
eyes
and
her
mother
s
long
dark
wavy
hair
she
was
generally
playful
and
took
greater
liberties
with
me
than
any
of
the
others
only
with
her
liberties
as
with
her
slang
she
knew
instinctively
when
where
and
how
much
for
on
the
borders
of
her
playfulness
there
seemed
ever
to
hang
a
fringe
of
thoughtfulness
as
if
she
felt
that
the
present
moment
owed
all
its
sparkle
and
brilliance
to
the
eternal
sunlight
and
the
appearance
was
not
in
the
least
a
deceptive
one
the
eternal
was
not
far
from
her
none
the
farther
that
she
enjoyed
life
like
a
bird
that
her
laugh
was
merry
that
her
heart
was
careless
and
that
her
voice
rang
through
the
house
a
sweet
soprano
voice
singing
snatches
of
songs
now
a
street
tune
she
had
caught
from
a
london
organ
now
an
air
from
handel
or
mozart
or
that
she
would
sometimes
tease
her
elder
sister
about
her
solemn
and
anxious
looks
for
wynnie
the
eldest
had
to
suffer
for
her
grandmother
s
sins
against
her
daughter
and
came
into
the
world
with
a
troubled
little
heart
that
was
soon
compelled
to
flee
for
refuge
to
the
rock
that
was
higher
than
she
ah
my
constance
but
god
was
good
to
you
and
to
us
in
you
where
shall
we
go
connie
i
said
and
the
same
moment
the
sound
of
the
horses
hoofs
reached
us
would
it
be
too
far
to
go
to
addicehead
she
returned
it
is
a
long
ride
i
answered
too
much
for
the
pony
o
dear
no
not
at
all
i
was
thinking
of
you
not
of
the
i
m
quite
as
able
to
ride
as
the
pony
is
to
carry
me
papa
and
i
want
to
get
something
for
wynnie
do
let
us
very
well
my
dear
i
said
and
raised
her
to
the
saddle
if
i
may
say
for
no
bird
ever
hopped
more
lightly
from
one
twig
to
another
than
she
sprung
from
the
ground
on
her
pony
s
back
in
a
moment
i
was
beside
her
and
away
we
rode
the
shadows
were
still
long
the
dew
still
pearly
on
the
spiders
webs
as
we
trotted
out
of
our
own
grounds
into
a
lane
that
led
away
towards
the
high
road
our
horses
were
fresh
and
the
air
was
exciting
so
we
turned
from
the
hard
road
into
the
first
suitable
field
and
had
a
gallop
to
begin
with
constance
was
a
good
for
she
had
been
used
to
the
saddle
longer
than
she
could
remember
she
was
now
riding
a
tall
pony
with
plenty
of
life
rather
too
much
i
sometimes
thought
when
i
was
out
with
wynnie
but
i
never
thought
so
when
i
was
with
constance
another
field
or
two
sufficiently
quieted
both
animals
i
did
not
want
to
have
all
our
time
taken
up
with
their
frolics
and
then
we
began
to
talk
you
are
getting
quite
a
woman
now
connie
my
dear
i
said
quite
an
old
grannie
papa
she
answered
old
enough
to
think
about
what
s
coming
next
i
said
gravely
o
papa
and
you
are
always
telling
us
that
we
must
not
think
about
the
morrow
or
even
the
next
hour
but
then
that
s
in
the
pulpit
she
added
with
a
sly
look
up
at
me
from
under
the
drooping
feather
of
her
pretty
hat
you
know
very
well
what
i
mean
you
puss
i
answered
and
i
don
t
say
one
thing
in
the
pulpit
and
another
out
of
she
was
at
my
horse
s
shoulder
with
a
bound
as
if
spry
her
pony
had
been
of
one
mind
and
one
piece
with
her
she
was
afraid
she
had
offended
me
she
looked
up
into
mine
with
as
anxious
a
face
as
ever
i
saw
upon
wynnie
o
thank
you
papa
she
said
when
i
smiled
i
thought
i
had
been
rude
i
didn
t
mean
it
indeed
i
didn
t
but
i
do
wish
you
would
make
it
a
little
plainer
to
me
i
do
think
about
things
sometimes
though
you
would
hardly
believe
what
do
you
want
made
plainer
my
child
i
asked
when
we
re
to
think
and
when
we
re
not
to
think
she
answered
i
remember
all
of
this
conversation
because
of
what
came
so
soon
after
if
the
known
duty
of
depends
on
the
work
of
i
answered
if
it
can
not
be
done
right
except
you
think
about
it
and
lay
your
plans
for
it
then
that
thought
is
s
business
not
dear
papa
some
of
your
explanations
are
more
difficult
than
the
things
themselves
may
i
be
as
impertinent
as
i
like
on
my
birthday
she
asked
suddenly
again
looking
up
in
my
face
we
were
walking
now
and
she
had
a
hold
of
my
horse
s
mane
so
as
to
keep
her
pony
close
up
yes
my
dear
as
impertinent
as
you
like
not
an
atom
more
well
papa
i
sometimes
wish
you
wouldn
t
explain
things
so
much
i
seem
to
understand
you
all
the
time
you
are
preaching
but
when
i
try
the
text
afterwards
by
myself
i
can
t
make
anything
of
it
and
i
ve
forgotten
every
word
you
said
about
perhaps
that
is
because
you
have
no
right
to
understand
i
thought
all
protestants
had
a
right
to
understand
every
word
of
the
bible
she
returned
if
they
can
i
rejoined
but
last
sunday
for
instance
i
did
not
expect
anybody
there
to
understand
a
certain
bit
of
my
sermon
except
your
mamma
and
thomas
how
funny
what
part
of
it
was
that
o
i
m
not
going
to
tell
you
you
have
no
right
to
understand
it
but
most
likely
you
thought
you
understood
it
perfectly
and
it
appeared
to
you
in
consequence
very
in
consequence
of
what
in
consequence
of
your
thinking
you
understood
o
papa
dear
you
re
getting
worse
and
worse
it
s
not
often
i
ask
you
anything
and
on
my
birthday
too
it
is
really
too
bad
of
you
to
bewilder
my
poor
little
brains
in
this
i
will
try
to
make
you
see
what
i
mean
my
pet
no
talk
about
an
idea
that
you
never
had
in
your
head
at
all
can
make
you
have
that
idea
if
you
had
never
seen
a
horse
no
description
even
not
to
say
no
amount
of
remark
would
bring
the
figure
of
a
horse
before
your
mind
much
more
is
this
the
case
with
truths
that
belong
to
the
convictions
and
feelings
of
the
heart
suppose
a
man
had
never
in
his
life
asked
god
for
anything
or
thanked
god
for
anything
would
his
opinion
as
to
what
david
meant
in
one
of
his
worshipping
psalms
be
worth
much
the
whole
thing
would
be
beyond
him
if
you
have
never
known
what
it
is
to
have
care
of
any
kind
upon
you
you
can
not
understand
what
our
lord
means
when
he
tells
us
to
take
no
thought
for
the
but
indeed
papa
i
am
very
full
of
care
sometimes
though
not
perhaps
about
precisely
but
that
does
not
matter
does
it
certainly
not
tell
me
what
you
are
full
of
care
about
my
child
and
perhaps
i
can
help
you
often
say
papa
that
half
the
misery
in
this
world
comes
from
idleness
and
that
you
do
not
believe
that
in
a
world
where
god
is
at
work
every
day
sundays
not
excepted
it
could
have
been
intended
that
women
any
more
than
men
should
have
nothing
to
do
now
what
am
i
to
do
what
have
i
been
sent
into
the
world
for
i
don
t
see
it
and
i
feel
very
useless
and
wrong
i
do
not
think
there
is
very
much
to
complain
of
you
in
that
respect
connie
you
and
your
sister
as
well
help
me
very
much
in
my
parish
you
take
much
off
your
mother
s
hands
too
and
you
do
a
good
deal
for
the
poor
you
teach
your
younger
brothers
and
sister
and
meantime
you
are
learning
yes
but
that
s
not
it
is
work
and
it
is
the
work
that
is
given
you
to
do
at
present
and
you
would
do
it
much
better
if
you
were
to
look
at
it
in
that
light
not
that
i
have
anything
to
complain
but
i
don
t
want
to
stop
at
home
and
lead
an
easy
comfortable
life
when
there
are
so
many
to
help
everywhere
in
the
is
there
anything
better
in
doing
something
where
god
has
not
placed
you
than
in
doing
it
where
he
has
placed
you
no
papa
but
my
sisters
are
quite
enough
for
all
you
have
for
us
to
do
at
home
is
nobody
ever
to
go
away
to
find
the
work
meant
for
her
you
won
t
think
dear
papa
that
i
want
to
get
away
from
home
will
you
no
my
dear
i
believe
that
you
are
really
thinking
about
duty
and
now
comes
the
moment
for
considering
the
passage
to
which
you
began
by
referring
what
god
may
hereafter
require
of
you
you
must
not
give
yourself
the
least
trouble
about
everything
he
gives
you
to
do
you
must
do
as
well
as
ever
you
can
and
that
is
the
best
possible
preparation
for
what
he
may
want
you
to
do
next
if
people
would
but
do
what
they
have
to
do
they
would
always
find
themselves
ready
for
what
came
next
and
i
do
not
believe
that
those
who
follow
this
rule
are
ever
left
floundering
on
the
sands
of
inaction
unable
to
find
water
enough
to
swim
thank
you
dear
papa
that
s
a
little
sermon
all
to
myself
and
i
think
i
shall
understand
it
even
when
i
think
about
it
afterwards
now
let
s
have
a
there
is
one
thing
more
i
ought
to
speak
about
though
connie
it
is
not
your
moral
nature
alone
you
ought
to
cultivate
you
ought
to
make
yourself
as
worth
god
s
making
as
you
possibly
can
now
i
am
a
little
doubtful
whether
you
keep
up
your
studies
at
she
shrugged
her
pretty
shoulders
playfully
looking
up
in
my
face
again
i
don
t
like
dry
things
nobody
nobody
she
exclaimed
how
do
the
grammars
and
come
to
be
written
then
in
talking
to
me
somehow
the
child
always
put
on
a
more
childish
tone
than
when
she
talked
to
anyone
else
i
am
certain
there
was
no
affection
in
it
though
indeed
how
could
she
be
affected
with
her
old
father
no
those
books
are
exceedingly
interesting
to
the
people
that
make
them
dry
things
are
just
things
that
you
do
not
know
enough
about
to
care
for
them
and
all
you
learn
at
school
is
next
to
nothing
to
what
you
have
to
what
must
i
do
then
she
asked
with
a
sigh
must
i
go
all
over
my
french
grammar
again
o
dear
i
do
hate
it
so
if
you
will
tell
me
something
you
like
connie
instead
of
something
you
don
t
like
i
may
be
able
to
give
you
advice
is
there
nothing
you
are
fond
of
i
continued
finding
that
she
remained
silent
i
don
t
know
anything
in
particular
that
is
i
don
t
know
anything
in
the
way
of
that
i
really
liked
i
don
t
mean
that
i
didn
t
try
to
do
what
i
had
to
do
for
i
did
there
was
just
one
thing
i
liked
the
poetry
we
had
to
learn
once
a
week
but
i
suppose
gentlemen
count
that
silly
don
t
they
on
the
contrary
my
dear
i
would
make
that
liking
of
yours
the
foundation
of
all
your
work
besides
i
think
poetry
the
grandest
thing
god
has
given
us
though
perhaps
you
and
i
might
not
quite
agree
about
what
poetry
was
poetry
enough
to
be
counted
an
especial
gift
of
god
now
what
poetry
do
you
like
best
mrs
hemans
s
i
think
well
very
well
to
begin
with
there
is
as
carlyle
said
to
a
friend
of
mine
there
is
a
thin
vein
of
true
poetry
in
but
it
is
time
you
had
done
with
thin
things
however
good
they
may
be
most
people
never
get
beyond
in
this
world
at
least
and
they
expect
nothing
else
in
the
world
to
come
i
must
take
you
in
hand
myself
and
see
what
i
can
do
for
you
it
is
wretched
to
see
capable
enough
creatures
all
for
want
of
a
little
guidance
bursting
with
admiration
of
what
owes
its
principal
charm
to
novelty
of
form
gained
at
the
cost
of
expression
and
sense
not
that
that
applies
to
hemans
she
is
simple
enough
only
diluted
to
a
degree
but
i
hold
that
whatever
mental
food
you
take
should
be
just
a
little
too
strong
for
you
that
implies
trouble
necessitates
growth
and
involves
i
sha
n
t
mind
how
difficult
it
is
if
you
help
me
papa
but
it
is
anything
but
satisfactory
to
go
groping
on
without
knowing
what
you
are
i
ought
to
have
mentioned
that
constance
had
been
at
school
for
two
years
and
had
only
been
home
a
month
that
very
day
in
order
to
account
for
my
knowing
so
little
about
her
tastes
and
habits
of
mind
we
went
on
talking
a
little
more
in
the
same
way
and
if
i
were
writing
for
young
people
only
i
should
be
tempted
to
go
on
a
little
farther
with
the
account
of
what
we
said
to
each
other
for
it
might
help
some
of
them
to
see
that
the
thing
they
like
best
should
circumstances
and
conscience
permitting
be
made
the
centre
from
which
they
start
to
learn
that
they
should
go
on
enlarging
their
knowledge
all
round
from
that
one
point
at
which
god
intended
them
to
begin
but
at
length
we
fell
into
a
silence
a
very
happy
one
on
my
part
for
i
was
more
than
delighted
to
find
that
this
one
too
of
my
children
was
following
after
the
truth
wanting
to
do
what
was
right
namely
to
obey
the
word
of
the
lord
whether
openly
spoken
to
all
or
to
herself
in
the
voice
of
her
own
conscience
and
the
light
of
that
understanding
which
is
the
candle
of
the
lord
i
had
often
said
to
myself
in
past
years
when
i
had
found
myself
in
the
company
of
young
ladies
who
announced
their
opinions
probably
of
no
deeper
origin
than
the
prejudices
of
their
nurses
as
if
these
distinguished
them
from
all
the
world
besides
who
were
profound
upon
passion
and
ignorant
of
grace
who
had
not
a
notion
whether
a
dress
was
beautiful
but
only
whether
it
was
of
the
newest
cut
i
had
often
said
to
myself
what
shall
i
do
if
my
daughters
come
to
talk
and
think
like
that
if
thinking
it
can
be
called
but
being
confident
that
instruction
for
which
the
mind
is
not
prepared
only
lies
in
a
rotting
heap
producing
all
kinds
of
mental
evils
correspondent
to
the
results
of
successive
loads
of
food
which
the
system
can
not
assimilate
my
hope
had
been
to
rouse
wise
questions
in
the
minds
of
my
children
in
place
of
overwhelming
their
digestions
with
what
could
be
of
no
instruction
or
edification
without
the
foregoing
appetite
now
my
constance
had
begun
to
ask
me
questions
and
it
made
me
very
happy
we
had
thus
come
a
long
way
nearer
to
each
other
for
however
near
the
affection
of
human
animals
may
bring
them
there
are
abysses
between
soul
and
soul
the
souls
even
of
father
and
daughter
over
which
they
must
pass
to
meet
and
i
do
not
believe
that
any
two
human
beings
alive
know
yet
what
it
is
to
love
as
love
is
in
the
glorious
will
of
the
father
of
lights
i
linger
on
with
my
talk
for
i
shrink
from
what
i
must
relate
we
were
going
at
a
gentle
trot
silent
along
a
woodland
path
a
brown
soft
shady
road
nearly
five
miles
from
home
our
horses
scattering
about
the
withered
leaves
that
lay
thick
upon
it
a
good
deal
of
underwood
and
a
few
large
trees
had
been
lately
cleared
from
the
place
there
were
many
piles
of
fagots
about
and
a
great
log
lying
here
and
there
along
the
side
of
the
path
one
of
these
when
a
tree
had
been
struck
by
lightning
and
had
stood
till
the
frosts
and
rains
had
bared
it
of
its
bark
now
it
lay
white
as
a
skeleton
by
the
side
of
the
path
and
was
i
think
the
cause
of
what
followed
all
at
once
my
daughter
s
pony
sprang
to
the
other
side
of
the
road
shying
sideways
unsettled
her
so
i
presume
then
rearing
and
plunging
threw
her
from
the
saddle
across
one
of
the
logs
of
which
i
have
spoken
i
was
by
her
side
in
a
moment
to
my
horror
she
lay
motionless
her
eyes
were
closed
and
when
i
took
her
up
in
my
arms
she
did
not
open
them
i
laid
her
on
the
moss
and
got
some
water
and
sprinkled
her
face
then
she
revived
a
little
but
seemed
in
much
pain
and
all
at
once
went
off
into
another
faint
i
was
in
terrible
perplexity
presently
a
man
who
having
been
cutting
fagots
at
a
little
distance
had
seen
the
pony
careering
through
the
wood
came
up
and
asked
what
he
could
do
to
help
me
i
told
him
to
take
my
horse
whose
bridle
i
had
thrown
over
the
latch
of
a
gate
and
ride
to
oldcastle
hall
and
ask
walton
to
come
with
the
carriage
as
quickly
as
possible
tell
her
i
said
that
her
daughter
has
had
a
fall
from
her
pony
and
is
rather
shaken
ride
as
hard
as
you
can
the
man
was
off
in
a
moment
and
there
i
sat
watching
my
poor
child
for
what
seemed
to
be
a
dreadfully
long
time
before
the
carriage
arrived
she
had
come
to
herself
quite
but
complained
of
much
pain
in
her
back
and
to
my
distress
i
found
that
she
could
not
move
herself
enough
to
make
the
least
change
of
her
position
she
evidently
tried
to
keep
up
as
well
as
she
could
but
her
face
expressed
great
suffering
it
was
dreadfully
pale
and
looked
worn
with
a
month
s
illness
all
my
fear
was
for
her
spine
at
length
i
caught
sight
of
the
carriage
coming
through
the
wood
as
fast
as
the
road
would
allow
with
the
woodman
on
the
box
directing
the
coachman
it
drew
up
and
my
wife
got
out
she
was
as
pale
as
constance
but
quiet
and
firm
her
features
composed
almost
to
determination
i
had
never
seen
her
look
like
that
before
she
asked
no
questions
there
was
time
enough
for
that
afterwards
she
had
brought
plenty
of
cushions
and
pillows
and
we
did
all
we
could
to
make
an
easy
couch
for
the
poor
girl
but
she
moaned
dreadfully
as
we
lifted
her
into
the
carriage
we
did
our
best
to
keep
her
from
being
shaken
but
those
few
miles
were
the
longest
journey
i
ever
made
in
my
life
when
we
reached
home
at
length
we
found
that
ethel
or
as
we
commonly
called
her
using
the
other
end
of
her
name
wynnie
for
she
was
named
after
her
mother
had
got
a
room
on
the
usually
given
to
visitors
ready
for
her
sister
and
we
were
glad
indeed
not
to
have
to
carry
her
up
the
stairs
before
my
wife
left
she
had
sent
the
groom
off
to
addicehead
for
both
physician
and
surgeon
a
young
man
who
had
settled
at
marshmallows
as
general
practitioner
a
year
or
two
before
was
waiting
for
us
when
we
arrived
he
helped
us
to
lay
her
upon
a
mattress
in
the
position
in
which
she
felt
the
least
pain
but
why
should
i
linger
over
the
sorrowful
detail
all
agreed
that
the
poor
child
s
spine
was
seriously
injured
and
that
probably
years
of
suffering
were
before
her
everything
was
done
that
could
be
done
but
she
was
not
moved
from
that
room
for
nine
months
during
which
though
her
pain
certainly
grew
less
by
degrees
her
want
of
power
to
move
herself
remained
almost
the
same
when
i
had
left
her
at
last
a
little
composed
with
her
mother
seated
by
her
bedside
i
called
my
other
two
daughters
wynnie
the
eldest
and
dorothy
the
youngest
whom
i
found
seated
on
the
floor
outside
one
on
each
side
of
the
door
weeping
into
my
study
and
said
to
them
my
darlings
this
is
very
sad
but
you
must
remember
that
it
is
god
s
will
and
as
you
would
both
try
to
bear
it
cheerfully
if
it
had
fallen
to
your
lot
to
bear
you
must
try
to
be
cheerful
even
when
it
is
your
sister
s
part
to
o
papa
poor
connie
cried
dora
and
burst
into
fresh
tears
wynnie
said
nothing
but
knelt
down
by
my
knee
and
laid
her
cheek
upon
it
shall
i
tell
you
what
constance
said
to
me
just
before
i
left
the
room
i
asked
please
do
she
whispered
you
must
try
to
bear
it
all
of
you
as
well
as
you
can
i
don
t
mind
it
very
much
only
for
so
you
see
if
you
want
to
make
her
comfortable
you
must
not
look
gloomy
and
troubled
sick
people
like
to
see
cheerful
faces
about
them
and
i
am
sure
connie
will
not
suffer
nearly
so
much
if
she
finds
that
she
does
not
make
the
household
this
i
had
learned
from
being
ill
myself
once
or
twice
since
my
marriage
my
wife
never
came
near
me
with
a
gloomy
face
and
i
had
found
that
it
was
quite
possible
to
be
sympathetic
with
those
of
my
flock
who
were
ill
without
putting
on
a
long
face
when
i
went
to
see
them
of
course
i
do
not
mean
that
i
could
or
that
it
was
desirable
that
i
should
look
cheerful
when
any
were
in
great
pain
or
mental
distress
but
in
ordinary
conditions
of
illness
a
cheerful
countenance
is
as
a
message
of
s
which
may
surely
be
carried
into
a
sick
chamber
by
the
man
who
believes
that
the
heart
of
a
loving
father
is
at
the
centre
of
things
that
he
is
light
all
about
the
darkness
and
that
he
will
not
only
bring
good
out
of
evil
at
last
but
will
be
with
the
sufferer
all
the
time
making
endurance
possible
and
pain
tolerable
there
are
a
thousand
alleviations
that
people
do
not
often
think
of
coming
from
god
himself
would
you
not
say
for
instance
that
time
must
pass
very
slowly
in
pain
but
have
you
never
observed
or
has
no
one
ever
made
the
remark
to
you
how
strangely
fast
even
in
severe
pain
the
time
passes
after
all
we
will
do
all
we
can
will
we
not
i
went
on
to
make
her
as
comfortable
as
possible
you
dora
must
attend
to
your
little
brothers
that
your
mother
may
not
have
too
much
to
think
about
now
that
she
will
have
connie
to
they
could
not
say
much
but
they
both
kissed
me
and
went
away
leaving
me
to
understand
clearly
enough
that
they
had
quite
understood
me
i
then
returned
to
the
sick
chamber
where
i
found
that
the
poor
child
had
fallen
asleep
my
wife
and
i
watched
by
her
bedside
on
alternate
nights
until
the
pain
had
so
far
subsided
and
the
fever
was
so
far
reduced
that
we
could
allow
wynnie
to
take
a
share
in
the
office
we
could
not
think
of
giving
her
over
to
the
care
of
any
but
one
of
ourselves
during
the
night
her
chief
suffering
came
from
its
being
necessary
that
she
should
keep
nearly
one
position
on
her
back
because
of
her
spine
while
the
external
bruise
and
the
swelling
of
the
muscles
were
in
consequence
so
painful
that
it
needed
all
that
mechanical
contrivance
could
do
to
render
the
position
endurable
but
these
outward
conditions
were
greatly
ameliorated
before
many
days
were
over
this
is
a
dreary
beginning
of
my
story
is
it
not
but
sickness
of
all
kinds
is
such
a
common
thing
in
the
world
that
it
is
well
sometimes
to
let
our
minds
rest
upon
it
lest
it
should
take
us
altogether
at
unawares
either
in
ourselves
or
our
friends
when
it
comes
if
it
were
not
a
good
thing
in
the
end
surely
it
would
not
be
and
perhaps
before
i
have
done
my
readers
will
not
be
sorry
that
my
tale
began
so
gloomily
the
sickness
in
judaea
eighteen
hundred
and
years
ago
or
thereabouts
has
no
small
part
in
the
story
of
him
who
came
to
put
all
things
under
our
feet
praise
be
to
him
for
evermore
it
soon
became
evident
to
me
that
that
room
was
like
a
new
and
more
sacred
heart
to
the
house
at
first
it
radiated
gloom
to
the
remotest
corners
but
soon
rays
of
light
began
to
appear
mingling
with
the
gloom
i
could
see
that
bits
of
news
were
carried
from
it
to
the
servants
in
the
kitchen
in
the
garden
in
the
stable
and
over
the
way
to
the
even
in
the
village
and
everywhere
over
the
parish
i
was
received
more
kindly
and
listened
to
more
willingly
because
of
the
trouble
i
and
my
family
were
in
while
in
the
house
although
we
had
never
been
anything
else
than
a
loving
family
it
was
easy
to
discover
that
we
all
drew
more
closely
together
in
consequence
of
our
common
anxiety
previous
to
this
it
had
been
no
unusual
thing
to
see
wynnie
and
dora
impatient
with
each
other
for
dora
was
none
the
less
a
wild
somewhat
lawless
child
that
she
was
a
profoundly
affectionate
one
she
rather
resembled
her
cousin
judy
in
fact
whom
she
called
aunt
judy
and
with
whom
she
was
naturally
a
great
favourite
wynnie
on
the
other
hand
was
sedate
and
rather
severe
more
severe
i
must
in
justice
say
with
herself
than
with
anyone
else
i
had
sometimes
wished
it
is
true
that
her
mother
in
regard
to
the
younger
children
were
more
like
her
but
there
i
was
wrong
for
one
of
the
great
goods
that
come
of
having
two
parents
is
that
the
one
balances
and
rectifies
the
motions
of
the
other
no
one
is
good
but
god
no
one
holds
the
truth
or
can
hold
it
in
one
and
the
same
thought
but
god
our
human
life
is
often
at
best
but
an
oscillation
between
the
extremes
which
together
make
the
truth
and
it
is
not
a
bad
thing
in
a
family
that
the
pendulums
of
father
and
mother
should
differ
in
movement
so
far
that
when
the
one
is
at
one
extremity
of
the
swing
the
other
should
be
at
the
other
so
that
they
meet
only
in
the
point
of
in
the
middle
that
the
predominant
tendency
of
the
one
should
not
be
the
predominant
tendency
of
the
other
i
was
a
very
strict
disciplinarian
too
much
so
perhaps
sometimes
ethelwyn
on
the
other
hand
was
too
much
inclined
i
thought
to
excuse
everything
i
was
law
she
was
grace
but
grace
often
yielded
to
law
and
law
sometimes
yielded
to
grace
yet
she
represented
the
higher
for
in
the
ultimate
triumph
of
grace
in
the
glad
performance
of
the
command
from
love
of
what
is
commanded
the
law
is
fulfilled
the
law
is
a
schoolmaster
to
bring
us
to
christ
i
must
say
this
for
myself
however
that
although
obedience
was
the
one
thing
i
enforced
believing
it
the
one
thing
upon
which
all
family
economy
primarily
depends
yet
my
object
always
was
to
set
my
children
free
from
my
law
as
soon
as
possible
in
a
word
to
help
them
to
become
as
soon
as
it
might
be
a
law
unto
themselves
then
they
would
need
no
more
of
mine
then
i
would
go
entirely
over
to
the
mother
s
higher
side
and
become
to
them
as
much
as
in
me
lay
no
longer
law
and
truth
but
grace
and
truth
but
to
return
to
my
children
it
was
soon
evident
not
only
that
wynnie
had
grown
more
indulgent
to
dora
s
vagaries
but
that
dora
was
more
submissive
to
wynnie
while
the
younger
children
began
to
obey
their
eldest
sister
with
a
willing
obedience
keeping
down
their
effervescence
within
doors
and
letting
it
off
only
out
of
doors
or
in
the
when
constance
began
to
recover
a
little
then
the
sacredness
of
that
chamber
began
to
show
itself
more
powerfully
radiating
on
all
sides
a
yet
stronger
influence
of
peace
and
goodwill
it
was
like
a
fountain
of
gentle
light
quieting
and
bringing
more
or
less
into
tune
all
that
came
within
the
circle
of
its
sweetness
this
brings
me
to
speak
again
of
my
lovely
child
for
surely
a
father
may
speak
thus
of
a
child
of
god
he
can
not
regard
his
child
as
his
even
as
a
book
he
has
written
may
be
his
a
man
s
child
is
his
because
god
has
said
to
him
take
this
child
and
nurse
it
for
she
is
god
s
making
god
s
marvellous
invention
to
be
tended
and
cared
for
and
ministered
unto
as
one
of
his
precious
things
a
young
angel
let
me
say
who
needs
the
air
of
this
lower
world
to
make
her
wings
grow
and
while
he
regards
her
thus
he
will
see
all
other
children
in
the
same
light
and
will
not
dare
to
set
up
his
own
against
others
of
god
s
brood
with
the
wings
the
universal
heart
of
truth
will
thus
rectify
while
it
intensifies
the
individual
feeling
towards
one
s
own
and
the
man
who
is
most
free
from
poor
partisanship
in
regard
to
his
own
family
will
feel
the
most
individual
tenderness
for
the
lovely
human
creatures
whom
god
has
given
into
his
own
especial
care
and
responsibility
show
me
the
man
who
is
tender
reverential
gracious
towards
the
children
of
other
men
and
i
will
show
you
the
man
who
will
love
and
tend
his
own
best
to
whose
heart
his
own
will
flee
for
their
first
refuge
after
god
when
they
catch
sight
of
the
cloud
in
the
wind
chapter
iii
the
sick
chamber
in
the
course
of
a
month
there
was
a
good
deal
more
of
light
in
the
smile
with
which
my
darling
greeted
me
when
i
entered
her
room
in
the
morning
her
pain
was
greatly
gone
but
the
power
of
moving
her
limbs
had
not
yet
even
begun
to
show
itself
one
day
she
received
me
with
a
still
happier
smile
than
i
had
yet
seen
upon
her
face
put
out
her
thin
white
hand
took
mine
and
kissed
it
and
said
papa
with
a
lingering
on
the
last
syllable
what
is
it
my
pet
i
asked
i
am
so
happy
what
makes
you
so
happy
i
asked
again
i
don
t
know
she
answered
i
haven
t
thought
about
it
yet
but
everything
looks
so
pleasant
round
me
is
it
nearly
winter
yet
papa
i
ve
forgotten
all
about
how
the
time
has
been
it
is
almost
winter
my
dear
there
is
hardly
a
leaf
left
on
the
trees
just
two
or
three
disconsolate
yellow
ones
that
want
to
get
away
down
to
the
rest
they
go
fluttering
and
fluttering
and
trying
to
break
away
but
they
can
that
is
just
as
i
felt
a
little
while
ago
i
wanted
to
die
and
get
away
papa
for
i
thought
i
should
never
be
well
again
and
i
should
be
in
everybody
s
i
am
afraid
i
shall
not
get
well
after
all
she
added
and
the
light
clouded
on
her
sweet
face
well
my
darling
we
are
in
god
s
hands
we
shall
never
get
tired
of
you
and
you
must
not
get
tired
of
us
would
you
get
tired
of
nursing
me
if
i
were
ill
o
papa
and
the
tears
began
to
gather
in
her
eyes
then
you
must
think
we
are
not
able
to
love
so
well
as
i
know
what
you
mean
i
did
not
think
of
it
that
way
i
will
never
think
so
about
it
again
i
was
only
thinking
how
useless
i
there
you
are
quite
mistaken
my
dear
no
living
creature
ever
was
useless
you
ve
got
plenty
to
do
but
what
have
i
got
to
do
i
don
t
feel
able
for
anything
she
said
and
again
the
tears
came
in
her
eyes
as
if
i
had
been
telling
her
to
get
up
and
she
could
not
a
great
deal
of
our
work
i
answered
we
do
without
knowing
what
it
is
but
i
ll
tell
you
what
you
have
got
to
do
you
have
got
to
believe
in
god
and
in
everybody
in
this
i
do
i
do
but
that
is
easy
to
do
she
returned
and
do
you
think
that
the
work
god
gives
us
to
do
is
never
easy
jesus
says
his
yoke
is
easy
his
burden
is
light
people
sometimes
refuse
to
do
god
s
work
just
because
it
is
easy
this
is
sometimes
because
they
can
not
believe
that
easy
work
is
his
work
but
there
may
be
a
very
bad
pride
in
it
it
may
be
because
they
think
that
there
is
little
or
no
honour
to
be
got
in
that
way
and
therefore
they
despise
it
some
again
accept
it
with
half
a
heart
and
do
it
with
half
a
hand
but
however
easy
any
work
may
be
it
can
not
be
well
done
without
taking
thought
about
it
and
such
people
instead
of
taking
thought
about
their
work
generally
take
thought
about
the
morrow
in
which
no
work
can
be
done
any
more
than
in
yesterday
the
holy
present
i
think
i
must
make
one
more
sermon
about
it
although
you
connie
i
said
meaning
it
for
a
little
joke
do
think
that
i
have
said
too
much
about
it
papa
papa
do
forgive
me
this
is
a
judgment
on
me
for
talking
to
you
as
i
did
that
dreadful
morning
but
i
was
so
happy
that
i
was
you
silly
darling
i
said
a
judgment
god
be
angry
with
you
for
that
even
if
it
had
been
anything
wrong
which
it
was
not
do
you
think
god
has
no
patience
no
connie
i
will
tell
you
what
seems
to
me
much
more
likely
you
wanted
something
to
do
and
so
god
gave
you
something
to
lying
in
bed
and
doing
nothing
yes
just
lying
in
bed
and
doing
his
if
i
could
but
feel
that
i
was
doing
his
will
when
you
do
it
then
you
will
feel
you
are
doing
i
know
you
are
coming
to
something
papa
please
make
haste
for
my
back
is
getting
so
i
ve
tired
you
my
pet
it
was
very
thoughtless
of
me
i
will
tell
you
the
rest
another
time
i
said
rising
no
no
it
will
make
me
much
worse
not
to
hear
it
all
well
i
will
tell
you
be
still
my
darling
i
won
t
be
long
in
the
time
of
the
old
sacrifices
when
god
so
kindly
told
his
ignorant
children
to
do
something
for
him
in
that
way
poor
people
were
told
to
bring
not
a
bullock
or
a
sheep
for
that
was
more
than
they
could
get
but
a
pair
of
turtledoves
or
two
young
pigeons
but
now
as
crashaw
the
poet
says
ourselves
become
our
own
best
god
wanted
to
teach
people
to
offer
themselves
now
you
are
poor
my
pet
and
you
can
not
offer
yourself
in
great
things
done
for
your
which
was
the
way
jesus
did
but
you
must
remember
that
the
two
young
pigeons
of
the
poor
were
just
as
acceptable
to
god
as
the
fat
bullock
of
the
rich
therefore
you
must
say
to
god
something
like
this
o
heavenly
father
i
have
nothing
to
offer
thee
but
my
patience
i
will
bear
thy
will
and
so
offer
my
will
a
unto
thee
i
will
be
as
useless
as
thou
depend
upon
it
my
darling
in
the
midst
of
all
the
science
about
the
world
and
its
ways
and
all
the
ignorance
of
god
and
his
greatness
the
man
or
woman
who
can
thus
say
will
be
with
the
true
heart
of
giving
up
is
nearer
the
secret
of
things
than
the
geologist
and
theologian
and
now
my
darling
be
quiet
in
god
s
she
held
up
her
mouth
to
kiss
me
but
did
not
speak
and
i
left
her
and
sent
dora
to
sit
with
her
in
the
evening
when
i
went
into
her
room
again
having
been
out
in
my
parish
all
the
morning
i
began
to
unload
my
budget
of
small
events
indeed
we
all
came
in
like
pelicans
with
stuffed
pouches
to
empty
them
in
her
room
as
if
she
had
been
the
only
young
one
we
had
and
we
must
cram
her
with
news
or
rather
she
was
like
the
queen
of
the
commonwealth
sending
out
her
messages
into
all
parts
and
receiving
messages
in
return
i
might
call
her
the
brain
of
the
house
but
i
have
used
similes
enough
for
a
while
after
i
had
done
talking
she
said
and
you
have
been
to
the
school
too
papa
yes
i
go
to
the
school
almost
every
day
i
fancy
in
such
a
school
as
ours
the
young
people
get
more
good
than
they
do
in
church
you
know
i
had
made
a
great
change
in
the
just
before
you
came
i
heard
of
that
papa
you
won
t
let
any
of
the
little
ones
go
to
school
on
the
no
it
is
too
much
for
them
and
having
made
this
change
i
feel
the
necessity
of
being
in
the
school
myself
nearly
every
day
that
i
may
do
something
direct
for
the
little
and
you
ll
have
to
take
me
up
soon
as
you
promised
you
know
papa
just
before
sprite
threw
as
soon
as
you
like
my
dear
after
you
are
able
to
read
o
you
must
begin
before
that
you
could
spare
time
to
read
a
little
to
me
couldn
t
you
she
said
doubtfully
as
if
she
feared
she
was
asking
too
much
certainly
my
dear
and
i
will
begin
to
think
about
it
at
it
was
in
part
the
result
of
this
wish
of
my
child
s
that
it
became
the
custom
to
gather
in
her
room
on
sunday
evenings
she
was
quite
unable
for
any
kind
of
work
such
as
she
would
have
had
me
commence
with
her
but
i
used
to
take
something
to
read
to
her
every
now
and
then
and
always
after
our
early
tea
on
sundays
what
a
thing
it
is
to
have
one
to
speak
and
think
about
and
try
to
find
out
and
understand
who
is
always
and
altogether
and
perfectly
good
such
a
centre
that
is
for
all
our
thoughts
and
words
and
actions
and
imaginations
it
is
indeed
blessed
to
be
human
beings
with
jesus
christ
for
the
centre
of
humanity
in
the
papers
wherein
i
am
about
to
record
the
chief
events
of
the
following
years
of
my
life
i
shall
give
a
short
account
of
what
passed
at
some
of
these
assemblies
in
my
child
s
room
in
the
hope
that
it
may
give
my
friends
something
if
not
new
yet
fresh
to
think
about
for
god
has
so
made
us
that
everyone
who
thinks
at
all
thinks
in
a
way
that
must
be
more
or
less
fresh
to
everyone
else
who
thinks
if
he
only
have
the
gift
of
setting
forth
his
thoughts
so
that
we
can
see
what
they
are
i
hope
my
readers
will
not
be
alarmed
at
this
and
suppose
that
i
am
about
to
inflict
long
sermons
upon
them
i
am
not
i
do
hope
as
i
say
to
teach
them
something
but
those
whom
i
succeed
in
so
teaching
will
share
in
the
delight
it
will
give
me
to
write
about
what
i
love
most
as
far
as
i
can
remember
i
will
tell
how
this
class
began
i
was
sitting
by
constance
s
bed
the
fire
was
burning
brightly
and
the
twilight
had
deepened
so
nearly
into
night
that
it
was
reflected
back
from
the
window
for
the
curtains
had
not
yet
been
drawn
there
was
no
light
in
the
room
but
that
of
the
fire
now
constance
was
in
the
way
of
asking
often
what
kind
of
day
or
night
it
was
for
there
never
was
a
girl
more
a
child
of
nature
than
she
her
heart
seemed
to
respond
at
once
to
any
and
every
mood
of
the
world
around
her
to
her
the
condition
of
air
earth
and
sky
was
news
and
news
of
poetic
interest
too
what
is
it
like
she
would
often
say
without
any
more
definite
shaping
of
the
question
this
same
evening
she
said
what
is
it
like
papa
it
is
growing
dark
i
answered
as
you
can
see
it
is
a
still
evening
and
what
they
call
a
black
frost
the
trees
are
standing
as
still
as
if
they
were
carved
out
of
stone
and
would
snap
off
everywhere
if
the
wind
were
to
blow
the
ground
is
dark
and
as
hard
as
if
it
were
of
cast
iron
a
gloomy
night
rather
my
dear
it
looks
as
if
there
were
something
upon
its
mind
that
made
it
sullenly
thoughtful
but
the
stars
are
coming
out
one
after
another
overhead
and
the
sky
will
be
all
awake
soon
a
strange
thing
the
life
that
goes
on
all
night
is
it
not
the
life
of
owlets
and
mice
and
beasts
of
prey
and
bats
and
stars
i
said
with
no
very
categorical
arrangement
and
dreams
and
flowers
that
don
t
go
to
sleep
like
the
rest
but
send
out
their
scent
all
night
long
only
those
are
gone
now
there
are
no
scents
abroad
not
even
of
the
earth
in
such
a
frost
as
don
t
you
think
it
looks
sometimes
papa
as
if
god
turned
his
back
on
the
world
or
went
farther
away
from
it
for
a
while
tell
me
a
little
more
what
you
mean
well
this
night
now
this
dark
frozen
lifeless
night
which
you
have
been
describing
to
me
isn
t
like
god
at
all
is
it
no
it
is
not
i
see
what
you
mean
it
is
just
as
if
he
had
gone
away
and
said
now
you
shall
see
what
you
can
do
without
something
like
that
but
do
you
know
that
english
people
at
least
i
think
so
enjoy
the
changeful
weather
of
their
country
much
more
upon
the
whole
than
those
who
have
fine
weather
constantly
you
see
it
is
not
enough
to
satisfy
god
s
goodness
that
he
should
give
us
all
things
richly
to
enjoy
but
he
must
make
us
able
to
enjoy
them
as
richly
as
he
gives
them
he
has
to
consider
not
only
the
gift
but
the
receiver
of
the
gift
he
has
to
make
us
able
to
take
the
gift
and
make
it
our
own
as
well
as
to
give
us
the
gift
in
fact
it
is
not
real
giving
with
the
full
that
is
the
divine
meaning
of
giving
without
it
he
has
to
give
us
to
the
gift
as
well
as
give
the
gift
to
us
now
for
this
a
break
an
interruption
is
good
is
invaluable
for
then
we
begin
to
think
about
the
thing
and
do
something
in
the
matter
ourselves
the
wonder
of
god
s
teaching
is
that
in
great
part
he
makes
us
not
merely
learn
but
teach
ourselves
and
that
is
far
grander
than
if
he
only
made
our
minds
as
he
makes
our
i
think
i
understand
you
papa
for
since
i
have
been
ill
you
would
wonder
if
you
could
see
into
me
how
even
what
you
tell
me
about
the
world
out
of
doors
gives
me
more
pleasure
than
i
think
i
ever
had
when
i
could
go
about
in
it
just
as
i
it
wouldn
t
do
that
though
you
know
if
you
hadn
t
had
the
other
first
the
pleasure
you
have
comes
as
much
from
your
memory
as
from
my
i
see
that
now
can
you
tell
me
anything
in
history
that
confirms
what
i
have
been
saying
i
don
t
know
anything
about
history
papa
the
only
thing
that
comes
into
my
head
is
what
you
were
saying
yourself
the
other
day
about
milton
s
ah
yes
i
had
not
thought
of
that
do
you
know
i
do
believe
that
god
wanted
a
grand
poem
from
that
man
and
therefore
blinded
him
that
he
might
be
able
to
write
it
but
he
had
first
trained
him
up
to
the
point
given
him
thirty
years
in
which
he
had
not
to
provide
the
bread
of
a
single
day
only
to
learn
and
think
then
set
him
to
teach
boys
then
placed
him
at
cromwell
s
side
in
the
midst
of
the
tumultuous
movement
of
public
affairs
into
which
the
late
student
entered
with
all
his
heart
and
soul
and
then
last
of
all
he
cast
the
veil
of
a
divine
darkness
over
him
sent
him
into
a
chamber
far
more
retired
than
that
in
which
he
laboured
at
cambridge
and
set
him
like
the
nightingale
to
sing
darkling
the
blackness
about
him
was
just
the
great
canvas
which
god
gave
him
to
cover
with
forms
of
light
and
music
deep
wells
of
memory
burst
upwards
from
below
the
windows
of
heaven
were
opened
from
above
from
both
rushed
the
deluge
of
song
which
flooded
his
soul
and
which
he
has
poured
out
in
a
great
river
to
it
was
rather
hard
for
poor
milton
though
wasn
t
it
papa
wait
till
he
says
so
my
dear
we
are
sometimes
too
ready
with
our
sympathy
and
think
things
a
great
deal
worse
than
those
who
have
to
undergo
them
who
would
not
be
glad
to
be
struck
with
blindness
as
milton
s
those
that
do
not
care
about
his
poetry
papa
answered
constance
with
a
deprecatory
smile
well
said
my
connie
and
to
such
it
never
can
come
but
if
it
please
god
you
will
love
milton
before
you
are
about
again
you
can
t
love
one
you
know
nothing
i
have
tried
to
read
him
a
yes
i
daresay
you
might
as
well
talk
of
liking
a
man
whose
face
you
had
never
seen
because
you
did
not
approve
of
the
back
of
his
coat
but
you
and
milton
together
have
led
me
away
from
a
far
grander
instance
of
what
we
had
been
talking
about
are
you
tired
darling
not
the
least
papa
you
don
t
mind
what
i
said
about
milton
not
at
all
my
dear
i
like
your
honesty
but
i
should
mind
very
much
if
you
thought
with
your
ignorance
of
milton
that
your
judgment
of
him
was
more
likely
to
be
right
than
mine
with
my
knowledge
of
o
papa
i
am
only
sorry
that
i
am
not
capable
of
appreciating
there
you
are
wrong
again
i
think
you
are
quite
capable
of
appreciating
him
but
you
can
not
appreciate
what
you
have
never
seen
you
think
of
him
as
dry
and
think
you
ought
to
be
able
to
like
dry
things
now
he
is
not
dry
and
you
ought
not
to
be
able
to
like
dry
things
you
have
a
figure
before
you
in
your
fancy
which
is
dry
and
which
you
call
milton
but
it
is
no
more
milton
than
your
dutch
doll
which
you
called
after
her
was
your
merry
aunt
judy
but
here
comes
your
mamma
and
i
haven
t
said
what
i
wanted
to
say
but
surely
husband
you
can
say
it
all
the
same
said
my
wife
i
will
go
away
if
you
can
i
can
say
it
all
the
better
my
love
come
and
sit
down
here
beside
me
i
was
trying
to
show
connie
you
did
show
me
well
i
was
showing
connie
that
a
gift
has
sometimes
to
be
taken
away
again
before
we
can
know
what
it
is
worth
and
so
receive
it
ethelwyn
sighed
she
was
always
more
open
to
the
mournful
than
the
glad
her
heart
had
been
dreadfully
wrung
in
her
youth
and
i
was
going
on
to
give
her
the
greatest
instance
of
it
in
human
history
as
long
as
our
lord
was
with
his
disciples
they
could
not
see
him
right
he
was
too
near
them
too
much
light
too
many
words
too
much
revelation
blinds
or
stupefies
the
lord
had
been
with
them
long
enough
they
loved
him
dearly
and
yet
often
forgot
his
words
almost
as
soon
as
he
said
them
he
could
not
get
it
into
them
for
instance
that
he
had
not
come
to
be
a
king
whatever
he
said
they
shaped
it
over
again
after
their
own
fancy
and
their
minds
were
so
full
of
their
own
worldly
notions
of
grandeur
and
command
that
they
could
not
receive
into
their
souls
the
gift
of
god
present
before
their
eyes
therefore
he
was
taken
away
that
his
spirit
which
was
more
himself
than
his
bodily
presence
might
come
into
them
that
they
might
receive
the
gift
of
god
into
their
innermost
being
after
he
had
gone
out
of
their
sight
and
they
might
look
all
around
and
down
in
the
grave
and
up
in
the
air
and
not
see
him
anywhere
when
they
thought
they
had
lost
him
he
began
to
come
to
them
again
from
the
other
side
from
the
inside
they
found
that
the
image
of
him
which
his
presence
with
them
had
printed
in
light
upon
their
souls
began
to
revive
in
the
dark
of
his
absence
and
not
that
only
but
that
in
looking
at
it
without
the
overwhelming
of
his
bodily
presence
lines
and
forms
and
meanings
began
to
dawn
out
of
it
which
they
had
never
seen
before
and
his
words
came
back
to
them
no
longer
as
they
had
received
them
but
as
he
meant
them
the
spirit
of
christ
filling
their
hearts
and
giving
them
new
power
made
them
remember
by
making
them
able
to
understand
all
that
he
had
said
to
them
they
were
then
always
saying
to
each
other
you
remember
how
whereas
before
they
had
been
always
staring
at
each
other
with
astonishment
and
something
very
near
incredulity
while
he
spoke
to
them
so
that
after
he
had
gone
away
he
was
really
nearer
to
them
than
he
had
been
before
the
meaning
of
anything
is
more
than
its
visible
presence
there
is
a
soul
in
everything
and
that
soul
is
the
meaning
of
it
the
soul
of
the
world
and
all
its
beauty
has
come
nearer
to
you
my
dear
just
because
you
are
separated
from
it
for
a
thank
you
dear
papa
i
do
like
to
get
a
little
sermon
all
to
myself
now
and
then
that
is
another
good
of
being
you
don
t
mean
me
to
have
a
share
in
it
then
connie
do
you
said
my
wife
smiling
at
her
daughter
s
pleasure
o
mamma
i
should
have
thought
you
knew
all
papa
had
got
to
say
by
this
time
i
daresay
he
has
given
you
a
thousand
sermons
all
to
then
you
suppose
connie
that
i
came
into
the
world
with
just
a
boxful
of
sermons
and
after
i
had
taken
them
all
out
there
were
no
more
i
should
be
sorry
to
think
i
should
not
have
a
good
many
new
things
to
say
by
this
time
next
well
papa
i
wish
i
could
be
sure
of
knowing
more
next
most
people
do
learn
whether
they
will
or
not
but
the
kind
of
learning
is
very
different
in
the
two
but
i
want
to
ask
you
one
question
papa
do
you
think
that
we
should
not
know
jesus
better
now
if
he
were
to
come
and
let
us
see
him
as
he
came
to
the
disciples
so
long
long
ago
i
wish
it
were
not
so
long
as
to
the
time
it
makes
no
difference
whether
it
was
last
year
or
two
thousand
years
ago
the
whole
question
is
how
much
we
understand
and
understanding
obey
him
and
i
do
not
think
we
should
be
any
nearer
that
if
he
came
amongst
us
bodily
again
if
we
should
he
would
come
i
believe
we
should
be
further
off
do
you
think
then
said
connie
in
an
almost
despairing
tone
as
if
i
were
the
prophet
of
great
evil
that
we
shall
never
never
never
see
him
that
is
another
thing
my
connie
that
is
the
heart
of
my
hopes
by
day
and
my
dreams
by
night
to
behold
the
face
of
jesus
seems
to
me
the
one
thing
to
be
desired
i
do
not
know
that
it
is
to
be
prayed
for
but
i
think
it
will
be
given
us
as
the
great
bounty
of
god
so
soon
as
ever
we
are
capable
of
it
that
sight
of
the
face
of
jesus
is
i
think
what
is
meant
by
his
glorious
appearing
but
it
will
come
as
a
consequence
of
his
spirit
in
us
not
as
a
cause
of
that
spirit
in
us
the
pure
in
heart
shall
see
god
the
seeing
of
him
will
be
the
sign
that
we
are
like
him
for
only
by
being
like
him
can
we
see
him
as
he
is
all
the
time
that
he
was
with
them
the
disciples
never
saw
him
as
he
was
you
must
understand
a
man
before
you
can
see
and
read
his
face
aright
and
as
the
disciples
did
not
understand
our
lord
s
heart
they
could
neither
see
nor
read
his
face
aright
but
when
we
shall
be
fit
to
look
that
man
in
the
face
god
only
then
do
you
think
papa
that
we
who
have
never
seen
him
could
know
him
better
than
the
disciples
i
don
t
mean
of
course
better
than
they
knew
him
after
he
was
taken
away
from
them
but
better
than
they
knew
him
while
he
was
still
with
them
certainly
i
do
my
o
papa
is
it
possible
why
don
t
we
all
then
because
we
won
t
take
the
trouble
that
is
the
o
what
a
grand
thing
to
think
that
would
be
worth
living
worth
being
ill
for
but
how
how
can
t
you
help
me
mayn
t
one
human
being
help
another
it
is
the
highest
duty
one
human
being
owes
to
another
but
whoever
wants
to
learn
must
pray
and
think
and
above
all
obey
that
is
simply
do
what
jesus
there
followed
a
little
silence
and
i
could
hear
my
child
sobbing
and
the
tears
stood
in
my
wife
s
eyes
tears
of
gladness
to
hear
her
daughter
s
sobs
i
will
try
papa
constance
said
at
last
but
you
help
me
that
i
will
my
love
i
will
help
you
in
the
best
way
i
know
by
trying
to
tell
you
what
i
have
heard
and
learned
about
him
heard
and
learned
of
the
father
i
hope
and
trust
it
is
coming
near
to
the
time
when
he
was
born
but
i
have
spoken
quite
as
long
as
you
are
able
to
bear
no
no
papa
do
go
no
my
dear
no
more
that
would
be
to
offend
against
the
very
truth
i
have
been
trying
to
set
forth
to
you
but
next
sunday
you
have
plenty
to
think
about
till
then
i
will
talk
to
you
about
the
baby
jesus
and
perhaps
i
may
find
something
more
to
help
you
by
that
time
besides
what
i
have
got
to
say
but
said
my
wife
don
t
you
think
connie
this
is
too
good
to
keep
all
to
ourselves
don
t
you
think
we
ought
to
have
wynnie
and
dora
in
yes
yes
mamma
do
let
us
have
them
in
and
harry
and
charlie
i
fear
they
are
rather
young
yet
i
said
perhaps
it
might
do
them
it
would
be
all
the
better
for
us
to
have
them
anyhow
said
ethelwyn
smiling
how
do
you
mean
my
dear
because
you
will
say
things
more
simply
if
you
have
them
by
you
besides
you
always
say
such
things
to
children
as
delight
grown
people
though
they
could
never
get
them
out
of
it
was
a
wife
s
speech
reader
forgive
me
for
writing
it
well
i
said
i
don
t
mind
them
coming
in
but
i
don
t
promise
to
say
anything
directly
to
them
and
you
must
let
them
go
away
the
moment
they
wish
certainly
answered
my
wife
and
so
the
matter
was
arranged
chapter
iv
a
sunday
evening
when
i
went
in
to
see
constance
the
next
sunday
morning
before
going
to
church
i
knew
by
her
face
that
she
was
expecting
the
evening
i
took
care
to
get
into
no
conversation
with
her
during
the
day
that
she
might
be
quite
fresh
in
the
evening
when
i
went
into
her
room
again
with
my
bible
in
my
hand
i
found
all
our
little
company
assembled
there
was
a
glorious
fire
for
it
was
very
cold
and
the
little
ones
were
seated
on
the
rug
before
it
one
on
each
side
of
their
mother
wynnie
sat
by
the
further
side
of
the
bed
for
she
always
avoided
any
place
or
thing
she
thought
another
might
like
and
dora
sat
by
the
further
leaving
the
space
between
the
fire
and
my
chair
open
that
i
might
see
and
share
the
glow
the
wind
is
very
high
papa
said
constance
as
i
seated
myself
beside
her
yes
my
dear
it
has
been
blowing
all
day
and
since
sundown
it
has
blown
harder
do
you
like
the
wind
connie
i
am
afraid
i
do
like
it
when
it
roars
like
that
in
the
chimneys
and
shakes
the
windows
with
a
great
rush
as
if
it
get
into
the
house
and
tear
us
to
pieces
and
then
goes
moaning
away
into
the
woods
and
grumbles
about
in
them
till
it
grows
savage
again
and
rushes
up
at
us
with
fresh
fury
i
am
afraid
i
delight
in
it
i
feel
so
safe
in
the
very
jaws
of
why
you
are
quite
poetic
connie
said
wynnie
don
t
laugh
at
me
wynnie
mind
i
m
an
invalid
and
i
can
t
bear
to
be
laughed
at
returned
connie
half
laughing
herself
and
a
little
more
than
a
quarter
crying
wynnie
rose
and
kissed
her
whispered
something
to
her
which
made
her
laugh
outright
and
then
sat
down
again
but
tell
me
connie
i
said
why
you
are
you
enjoy
hearing
the
wind
about
the
because
it
must
be
so
dreadful
for
those
that
are
out
in
perhaps
not
quite
so
bad
as
we
think
you
must
not
suppose
that
god
has
forgotten
them
or
cares
less
for
them
than
for
you
because
they
are
out
in
the
but
if
we
thought
like
that
papa
said
wynnie
shouldn
t
we
come
to
feel
that
their
sufferings
were
none
of
our
business
if
our
benevolence
rests
on
the
belief
that
god
is
less
loving
than
we
it
will
come
to
a
bad
end
somehow
before
long
of
course
i
could
not
think
that
she
returned
then
your
kindness
would
be
such
that
you
dared
not
in
god
s
name
think
hopefully
for
those
you
could
not
help
lest
you
should
believing
in
his
kindness
cease
to
help
those
whom
you
could
help
either
god
intended
that
there
should
be
poverty
and
suffering
or
he
did
not
if
he
did
not
intend
it
for
similar
reasons
to
those
for
which
he
allows
all
sorts
of
evils
then
there
is
nothing
between
but
that
we
should
sell
everything
that
we
have
and
give
it
away
to
the
then
why
don
t
we
said
wynnie
looking
truth
itself
in
my
face
because
that
is
not
god
s
way
and
we
should
do
no
end
of
harm
by
so
doing
we
should
make
so
many
more
of
those
who
will
not
help
themselves
who
will
not
be
set
free
from
themselves
by
rising
above
themselves
we
are
not
to
gratify
our
own
benevolence
at
the
expense
of
its
object
not
to
save
our
own
souls
as
we
fancy
by
putting
other
souls
into
more
danger
than
god
meant
for
it
sounds
hard
doctrine
from
your
lips
papa
said
wynnie
many
things
will
look
hard
in
so
many
words
which
yet
will
be
found
kindness
itself
when
they
are
interpreted
by
a
higher
theory
if
the
one
thing
is
to
let
people
have
everything
they
want
then
of
course
everyone
ought
to
be
rich
i
have
no
doubt
such
a
man
as
we
were
reading
of
in
the
papers
the
other
day
who
saw
his
servant
girl
drown
without
making
the
least
effort
to
save
her
and
then
bemoaned
the
loss
of
her
labour
for
the
coming
harvest
thinking
himself
in
her
death
would
hug
his
own
selfishness
on
hearing
my
words
and
say
all
right
parson
every
man
for
himself
i
made
my
own
money
and
they
may
make
theirs
know
that
is
not
exactly
the
way
i
should
think
or
act
with
regard
to
my
neighbour
but
if
it
were
only
that
i
have
seen
such
noble
characters
cast
in
the
mould
of
poverty
i
should
be
compelled
to
regard
poverty
as
one
of
god
s
powers
in
the
world
for
raising
the
children
of
the
kingdom
and
to
believe
that
it
was
not
because
it
could
not
be
helped
that
our
lord
said
the
poor
ye
have
always
with
but
what
i
wanted
to
say
was
that
there
can
be
no
reason
why
connie
should
not
enjoy
what
god
has
given
her
although
he
has
not
thought
fit
to
give
as
much
to
everybody
and
above
all
that
we
shall
not
help
those
right
whom
god
gives
us
to
help
if
we
do
not
believe
that
god
is
caring
for
every
one
of
them
as
much
as
he
is
caring
for
every
one
of
us
there
was
once
a
baby
born
in
a
stable
because
his
poor
mother
could
get
no
room
in
a
decent
house
where
she
lay
i
can
hardly
think
they
must
have
made
a
bed
of
hay
and
straw
for
her
in
the
stall
for
we
know
the
baby
s
cradle
was
the
manger
had
god
forsaken
them
or
would
they
not
have
been
more
if
that
was
the
main
thing
somewhere
else
ah
if
the
disciples
who
were
being
born
about
the
same
time
of
and
to
get
ready
for
him
to
call
and
teach
by
the
time
he
should
be
thirty
years
of
age
if
they
had
only
been
old
enough
and
had
known
that
he
was
coming
would
they
not
have
got
everything
ready
for
him
they
would
have
clubbed
their
little
savings
together
and
worked
day
and
night
and
some
rich
women
would
have
helped
them
and
they
would
have
dressed
the
baby
in
fine
linen
and
got
him
the
richest
room
their
money
would
get
and
they
would
have
made
the
gold
that
the
wise
men
brought
into
a
crown
for
his
little
head
and
would
have
burnt
the
frankincense
before
him
and
so
our
little
would
have
been
taken
away
from
us
no
more
the
saviour
no
more
the
poor
son
of
god
born
for
us
all
as
strong
as
noble
as
loving
as
worshipful
as
beautiful
as
he
was
poor
and
we
should
not
have
learned
that
god
does
not
care
for
money
that
if
he
does
not
give
more
of
it
it
is
not
that
it
is
scarce
with
him
or
that
he
is
unkind
but
that
he
does
not
value
it
himself
and
if
he
sent
his
own
son
to
be
not
merely
brought
up
in
the
house
of
the
carpenter
of
a
little
village
but
to
be
born
in
the
stable
of
a
village
inn
we
need
not
suppose
because
a
man
sleeps
under
a
haystack
and
is
put
in
prison
for
it
next
day
that
god
does
not
care
for
but
why
did
jesus
come
so
poor
papa
that
he
might
be
just
a
human
baby
that
he
might
not
be
distinguished
by
this
or
by
that
accident
of
birth
that
he
might
have
nothing
but
a
mother
s
love
to
welcome
him
and
so
belong
to
everybody
that
from
the
first
he
might
show
that
the
kingdom
of
god
and
the
favour
of
god
lie
not
in
these
external
things
at
all
that
the
poorest
little
one
born
in
the
meanest
dwelling
or
in
none
at
all
is
as
much
god
s
own
and
god
s
care
as
if
he
came
in
a
royal
chamber
with
colour
and
shine
all
about
him
had
jesus
come
amongst
the
rich
riches
would
have
been
more
worshipped
than
ever
see
how
so
many
that
count
themselves
good
christians
honour
possession
and
family
and
social
rank
and
i
doubt
hardly
get
rid
of
them
when
they
are
all
swept
away
from
them
the
furthest
most
of
such
reach
is
to
count
jesus
an
exception
and
therefore
not
despise
him
see
how
even
in
the
services
of
the
church
as
they
call
them
they
will
accumulate
gorgeousness
and
cost
had
i
my
way
though
i
will
never
seek
to
rouse
men
s
thoughts
about
such
external
things
i
would
never
have
any
vessel
used
in
the
eucharist
but
wooden
platters
and
wooden
but
are
we
not
to
serve
him
with
our
best
said
my
wife
yes
with
our
very
hearts
and
souls
with
our
wills
with
our
absolute
being
but
all
external
things
should
be
in
harmony
with
the
spirit
of
his
revelation
and
if
god
chose
that
his
son
should
visit
the
earth
in
homely
fashion
in
homely
fashion
likewise
should
be
everything
that
enforces
and
commemorates
that
revelation
all
should
be
on
the
other
side
from
show
and
expense
let
the
money
go
to
build
decent
houses
for
god
s
poor
not
to
give
them
his
holy
bread
and
wine
out
of
silver
and
gold
and
precious
stones
stealing
from
the
significance
of
the
by
the
meretricious
grandeur
of
the
i
would
send
all
the
to
fight
the
devil
with
his
own
weapons
in
our
overcrowded
cities
and
in
our
villages
where
the
husbandmen
are
housed
like
swine
by
giving
them
room
to
be
clean
and
decent
air
from
heaven
to
breathe
when
the
people
find
the
clergy
thus
in
earnest
they
will
follow
them
fast
enough
and
the
money
will
come
in
like
salt
and
oil
upon
the
sacrifice
i
would
there
were
a
few
of
our
dignitaries
that
could
think
grandly
about
things
even
as
jesus
thought
even
as
god
thought
when
he
sent
him
there
are
many
of
them
willing
to
stand
any
amount
of
persecution
about
trifles
the
same
enthusiasm
directed
by
high
thoughts
about
the
kingdom
of
heaven
as
within
men
and
not
around
them
would
redeem
a
vast
region
from
that
indifference
which
comes
of
judging
the
gospel
of
god
by
the
church
of
christ
with
its
phylacteries
and
there
is
one
thing
said
wynnie
after
a
pause
that
i
have
often
thought
about
why
it
was
necessary
for
jesus
to
come
as
a
baby
he
could
not
do
anything
for
so
first
i
would
answer
wynnie
that
if
you
would
tell
me
why
it
is
necessary
for
all
of
us
to
come
as
babies
it
would
be
less
necessary
for
me
to
tell
you
why
he
came
so
whatever
was
human
must
be
his
but
i
would
say
next
are
you
sure
that
he
could
not
do
anything
for
so
long
does
a
baby
do
nothing
ask
mamma
there
is
it
for
nothing
that
the
mother
lifts
up
such
heartfuls
of
thanks
to
god
for
the
baby
on
her
knee
is
it
nothing
that
the
baby
opens
such
fountains
of
love
in
almost
all
the
hearts
around
ah
you
do
not
think
how
much
every
baby
has
to
do
with
the
saving
of
the
world
the
saving
of
it
from
selfishness
and
folly
and
greed
and
for
jesus
was
he
not
going
to
establish
the
reign
of
love
in
the
earth
how
could
he
do
better
than
begin
from
babyhood
he
had
to
lay
hold
of
the
heart
of
the
world
how
could
he
do
better
than
begin
with
his
mother
s
the
best
one
in
it
through
his
mother
s
love
first
he
grew
into
the
world
it
was
first
by
the
door
of
all
the
holy
relations
of
the
family
that
he
entered
the
human
world
laying
hold
of
mother
father
brothers
sisters
all
his
friends
then
by
the
door
of
labour
for
he
took
his
share
of
his
father
s
work
then
when
he
was
thirty
years
of
age
by
the
door
of
teaching
by
kind
deeds
and
sufferings
and
through
all
by
obedience
unto
the
death
you
must
not
think
little
of
the
grand
thirty
years
wherein
he
got
ready
for
the
chief
work
to
follow
you
must
not
think
that
while
he
was
thus
preparing
for
his
public
ministrations
he
was
not
all
the
time
saving
the
world
even
by
that
which
he
was
in
the
midst
of
it
ever
laying
hold
of
it
more
and
more
these
were
things
not
so
easy
to
tell
and
you
must
remember
that
our
records
are
very
scanty
it
is
a
small
biography
we
have
of
a
man
who
became
to
say
nothing
more
the
man
of
the
world
the
son
of
man
no
doubt
it
is
enough
or
god
would
have
told
us
more
but
surely
we
are
not
to
suppose
that
there
was
nothing
significant
nothing
of
saving
power
in
that
which
we
are
not
charlie
wouldn
t
you
have
liked
to
see
the
little
baby
jesus
yes
that
i
would
i
would
have
given
him
my
white
rabbit
with
the
pink
that
is
what
the
great
painter
titian
must
have
thought
charlie
for
he
has
painted
him
playing
with
a
white
rabbit
not
such
a
pretty
one
as
i
would
have
carried
him
about
all
day
said
dora
as
little
henny
parsons
does
her
did
he
have
any
brother
or
sister
to
carry
him
about
papa
asked
harry
no
my
boy
for
he
was
the
eldest
but
you
may
be
pretty
sure
he
carried
about
his
brothers
and
sisters
that
came
after
wouldn
t
he
take
care
of
them
just
said
charlie
i
wish
i
had
been
one
of
them
said
constance
you
are
one
of
them
my
connie
now
he
is
so
great
and
so
strong
that
he
can
carry
father
and
mother
and
all
of
us
in
his
then
we
sung
a
child
s
hymn
in
praise
of
the
god
of
little
children
and
the
little
ones
went
to
bed
constance
was
tired
now
and
we
left
her
with
wynnie
we
too
went
early
to
bed
about
midnight
my
wife
and
i
awoke
together
at
least
neither
knew
which
waked
the
other
the
wind
was
still
raving
about
the
house
with
lulls
between
its
charges
there
s
a
child
crying
said
my
wife
starting
up
i
sat
up
too
and
listened
there
is
some
creature
i
granted
it
is
an
infant
insisted
my
wife
it
can
t
be
either
of
the
i
was
out
of
bed
in
a
moment
and
my
wife
the
same
instant
we
hurried
on
some
of
our
clothes
going
to
the
windows
and
listening
as
we
did
so
we
seemed
to
hear
the
wailing
through
the
loudest
of
the
wind
and
in
the
lulls
were
sure
of
it
but
it
grew
fainter
as
we
listened
the
night
was
pitch
dark
i
got
a
lantern
and
hurried
out
i
went
round
the
house
till
i
came
under
our
windows
and
there
listened
i
heard
it
but
not
so
clearly
as
before
i
set
out
as
well
as
i
could
judge
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
i
could
find
nothing
my
lantern
lighted
only
a
few
yards
around
me
and
the
wind
was
so
strong
that
it
blew
through
every
chink
and
threatened
momently
to
blow
it
out
my
wife
was
by
my
side
before
i
knew
she
was
coming
my
dear
i
said
it
is
not
fit
for
you
to
be
it
is
as
fit
for
me
as
for
a
child
anyhow
she
said
do
it
was
certainly
no
time
for
expostulation
all
the
mother
was
awake
in
ethelwyn
s
bosom
it
would
have
been
cruelty
to
make
her
go
in
though
she
was
indeed
to
encounter
such
a
another
wail
reached
us
it
seemed
to
come
from
a
thicket
at
one
corner
of
the
lawn
we
hurried
thither
again
a
cry
and
we
knew
we
were
much
nearer
to
it
searching
and
searching
we
went
there
it
is
ethelwyn
almost
screamed
as
the
feeble
light
of
the
lantern
fell
on
a
dark
bundle
of
something
under
a
bush
she
caught
at
it
it
gave
another
pitiful
wail
the
poor
baby
of
some
tramp
rolled
up
in
a
dirty
ragged
shawl
and
tied
round
with
a
bit
of
string
as
if
it
had
been
a
parcel
of
clouts
she
set
off
running
with
it
to
the
house
and
i
followed
much
fearing
she
would
miss
her
way
in
the
dark
and
fall
i
could
hardly
get
up
with
her
so
eager
was
she
to
save
the
child
she
darted
up
to
her
own
room
where
the
fire
was
not
yet
out
run
to
the
kitchen
harry
and
get
some
hot
water
take
the
two
jugs
there
you
can
empty
them
in
the
sink
you
won
t
know
where
to
find
anything
there
will
be
plenty
in
the
by
the
time
i
returned
with
the
hot
water
she
had
taken
off
the
child
s
covering
and
was
sitting
with
it
wrapped
in
a
blanket
before
the
fire
the
little
thing
was
cold
as
a
stone
and
now
silent
and
motionless
we
had
found
it
just
in
time
ethelwyn
ordered
me
about
as
if
i
had
been
a
nursemaid
i
poured
the
hot
water
into
a
footbath
some
cold
water
harry
you
would
boil
the
you
made
me
throw
away
the
cold
water
i
said
laughing
there
s
some
in
the
bottles
she
returned
make
i
did
try
to
make
haste
but
i
could
not
be
quick
enough
to
satisfy
ethelwyn
the
child
will
be
dead
she
cried
before
we
get
it
in
the
she
had
its
rags
off
in
a
moment
there
was
very
little
to
remove
after
the
shawl
how
white
the
little
thing
was
though
dreadfully
neglected
it
was
a
girl
not
more
than
a
few
weeks
old
we
agreed
her
little
heart
was
still
beating
feebly
and
as
she
was
a
apparently
healthy
infant
we
had
every
hope
of
recovering
her
and
we
were
not
disappointed
she
began
to
move
her
little
legs
and
arms
with
short
convulsive
motions
do
you
know
where
the
dairy
is
harry
asked
my
wife
with
no
great
compliment
to
my
bumps
of
locality
which
i
had
always
flattered
myself
were
beyond
the
average
in
development
i
think
i
do
i
answered
could
you
tell
which
was
this
night
s
milk
now
there
will
be
less
cream
on
it
i
answered
bring
a
little
of
that
and
some
more
hot
water
i
ve
got
some
sugar
here
i
wish
we
had
a
i
executed
her
commands
faithfully
by
the
time
i
returned
the
child
was
lying
on
her
lap
clean
and
dry
a
fine
baby
i
thought
ethelwyn
went
on
talking
to
her
and
praising
her
as
if
she
had
not
only
been
the
finest
specimen
of
mortality
in
the
world
but
her
own
child
to
boot
she
got
her
to
take
a
few
spoonfuls
of
milk
and
water
and
then
the
little
thing
fell
fast
asleep
ethelwyn
s
nursing
days
were
not
so
far
gone
by
that
she
did
not
know
where
her
baby
s
clothes
were
she
gave
me
the
child
and
going
to
a
wardrobe
in
the
room
brought
out
some
and
put
them
on
i
could
not
understand
in
the
least
why
the
sleeping
darling
must
be
indued
with
little
chemise
and
flannel
and
nightgown
and
i
do
not
know
what
all
requiring
a
world
of
nice
care
and
a
hundred
turnings
to
and
fro
now
on
its
little
stomach
now
on
its
back
now
sitting
up
now
lying
down
when
it
would
have
slept
just
as
well
and
i
venture
to
think
much
more
comfortably
if
laid
in
blankets
and
well
covered
over
but
i
had
never
ventured
to
interfere
with
any
of
my
own
children
devoutly
believing
up
to
this
moment
though
in
a
dim
unquestioning
way
that
there
must
be
some
hidden
feminine
wisdom
in
the
whole
process
and
now
that
i
had
begun
to
question
it
i
found
that
my
opportunity
had
long
gone
by
if
i
had
ever
had
one
and
after
all
there
may
be
some
reason
for
it
though
i
confess
i
do
strongly
suspect
that
all
these
matters
are
so
wonderfully
complicated
in
order
that
the
girl
left
in
the
woman
may
have
her
heart
s
content
of
playing
with
her
doll
just
as
the
woman
hid
in
the
girl
expends
no
end
of
lovely
affection
upon
the
dull
stupidity
of
wooden
cheeks
and
a
body
of
sawdust
but
it
was
a
delight
to
my
heart
to
see
how
ethelwyn
could
not
be
satisfied
without
treating
the
foundling
in
precisely
the
same
fashion
as
one
of
her
own
and
if
this
was
a
necessary
preparation
for
what
should
follow
i
would
be
the
very
last
to
complain
of
it
we
went
to
bed
again
and
the
forsaken
child
of
some
mother
now
perhaps
asleep
in
some
filthy
lodging
for
tramps
lay
in
my
ethelwyn
s
bosom
i
loved
her
the
more
for
it
though
i
confess
it
would
have
been
very
painful
to
me
had
she
shown
it
possible
for
her
to
treat
the
baby
otherwise
especially
after
what
we
had
been
talking
about
that
same
evening
so
we
had
another
child
in
the
house
and
nobody
knew
anything
about
it
but
ourselves
two
the
household
had
never
been
disturbed
by
all
the
going
and
coming
after
everything
had
been
done
for
her
we
had
a
good
laugh
over
the
whole
matter
and
then
ethelwyn
fell
pray
for
the
poor
thing
harry
she
sobbed
before
you
come
to
i
knelt
down
and
said
o
lord
our
father
this
is
as
much
thy
child
and
as
certainly
sent
to
us
as
if
she
had
been
born
of
us
help
us
to
keep
the
child
for
thee
take
thou
care
of
thy
own
and
teach
us
what
to
do
with
her
and
how
to
order
our
ways
towards
then
i
said
to
ethelwyn
we
will
not
say
one
word
more
about
it
tonight
you
must
try
to
go
to
sleep
i
daresay
the
little
thing
will
sleep
till
the
morning
and
i
am
sure
i
shall
if
she
does
my
love
you
are
a
true
mother
mind
you
go
to
i
am
half
asleep
already
harry
she
returned
i
know
nothing
more
about
anything
till
i
in
the
morning
except
that
i
had
a
dream
which
i
have
not
made
up
my
mind
yet
whether
i
shall
tell
or
not
we
slept
soundly
god
s
baby
and
all
chapter
my
dream
i
think
i
will
tell
the
dream
i
had
i
can
not
well
account
for
the
beginning
of
it
the
end
will
appear
sufficiently
explicable
to
those
who
are
quite
satisfied
that
they
get
rid
of
the
mystery
of
a
thing
when
they
can
associate
it
with
something
else
with
which
they
are
familiar
such
do
not
care
to
see
that
the
thing
with
which
they
associate
it
may
be
as
mysterious
as
the
other
for
although
use
too
often
destroys
marvel
it
can
not
destroy
the
marvellous
the
origin
of
our
thoughts
is
just
as
wonderful
as
the
origin
of
our
dreams
in
my
dream
i
found
myself
in
a
pleasant
field
full
of
daisies
and
white
clover
the
sun
was
setting
the
wind
was
going
one
way
and
the
shadows
another
i
felt
rather
tired
i
neither
knew
nor
thought
why
with
an
old
man
s
prudence
i
would
not
sit
down
upon
the
grass
but
looked
about
for
a
more
suitable
seat
then
i
saw
for
often
in
our
dreams
there
is
an
immediate
response
to
our
wishes
a
long
rather
narrow
stone
lying
a
few
yards
from
me
i
wondered
how
it
could
have
come
there
for
there
were
no
mountains
or
rocks
near
the
field
was
part
of
a
level
country
carelessly
i
sat
down
upon
it
astride
and
watched
the
setting
of
the
sun
somehow
i
fancied
that
his
light
was
more
sorrowful
than
the
light
of
the
setting
sun
should
be
and
i
began
to
feel
very
heavy
at
the
heart
no
sooner
had
the
last
brilliant
spark
of
his
light
vanished
than
i
felt
the
stone
under
me
begin
to
move
with
the
inactivity
of
a
dreamer
however
i
did
not
care
to
rise
but
wondered
only
what
would
come
next
my
seat
after
several
strange
tumbling
motions
seemed
to
rise
into
the
air
a
little
way
and
then
i
found
that
i
was
astride
of
a
gaunt
bony
horse
a
skeleton
horse
almost
only
he
had
a
gray
skin
on
him
he
began
apparently
with
pain
as
if
his
joints
were
all
but
too
stiff
to
move
to
go
forward
in
the
direction
in
which
he
found
himself
i
kept
my
seat
indeed
i
never
thought
of
dismounting
i
was
going
on
to
meet
what
might
come
slowly
feebly
trembling
at
every
step
the
strange
steed
went
and
as
he
went
his
joints
seemed
to
become
less
stiff
and
he
went
a
little
faster
all
at
once
i
found
that
the
pleasant
field
had
vanished
and
that
we
were
on
the
borders
of
a
moor
straight
forward
the
horse
carried
me
and
the
moor
grew
very
rough
and
he
went
stumbling
dreadfully
but
always
recovering
himself
every
moment
it
seemed
as
if
he
would
fall
to
rise
no
more
but
as
often
he
found
fresh
footing
at
length
the
surface
became
a
little
smoother
and
he
began
a
horrible
canter
which
lasted
till
he
reached
a
low
broken
wall
over
which
he
half
walked
half
fell
into
what
was
plainly
an
ancient
neglected
churchyard
the
mounds
were
low
and
covered
with
rank
grass
in
some
parts
hollows
had
taken
the
place
of
mounds
gravestones
lay
in
every
position
except
the
level
or
the
upright
and
broken
masses
of
monuments
were
scattered
about
my
horse
bore
me
into
the
midst
of
it
and
there
slow
and
stiff
as
he
had
risen
he
lay
down
again
once
more
i
was
astride
of
a
long
narrow
stone
and
now
i
found
that
it
was
an
ancient
gravestone
which
i
knew
well
in
a
certain
sussex
churchyard
the
top
of
it
carved
into
the
rough
resemblance
of
a
human
skeleton
that
of
a
man
tradition
said
who
had
been
killed
by
a
serpent
that
came
out
of
a
bottomless
pool
in
the
next
field
how
long
i
sat
there
i
do
not
know
but
at
last
i
saw
the
faint
gray
light
of
morning
begin
to
appear
in
front
of
me
the
horse
of
death
had
carried
me
eastward
the
dawn
grew
over
the
top
of
a
hill
that
here
rose
against
the
horizon
but
it
was
a
wild
dreary
dawn
a
blot
of
gray
first
which
then
stretched
into
long
lines
of
dreary
yellow
and
gray
looking
more
like
a
blasted
and
withered
sunset
than
a
fresh
sunrise
and
well
it
suited
that
waste
wide
deserted
churchyard
if
churchyard
i
ought
to
call
it
where
no
church
was
to
be
seen
only
a
vast
hideous
square
of
graves
before
me
i
noticed
especially
one
old
grave
the
flat
stone
of
which
had
broken
in
two
and
sunk
in
the
middle
while
i
sat
with
my
eyes
fixed
on
this
stone
it
began
to
move
the
crack
in
the
middle
closed
then
widened
again
as
the
two
halves
of
the
stone
were
lifted
up
and
flung
outward
like
the
two
halves
of
a
folding
door
from
the
grave
rose
a
little
child
smiling
such
perfect
contentment
as
if
he
had
just
come
from
kissing
his
mother
his
little
arms
had
flung
the
stones
apart
and
as
he
stood
on
the
edge
of
the
grave
next
to
me
they
remained
outspread
from
the
action
for
a
moment
as
if
blessing
the
sleeping
people
then
he
came
towards
me
with
the
same
smile
and
took
my
hand
i
rose
and
he
led
me
away
over
another
broken
wall
towards
the
hill
that
lay
before
us
and
as
we
went
the
sun
came
nearer
the
pale
yellow
bars
flushed
into
orange
and
rosy
red
till
at
length
the
edges
of
the
clouds
were
swept
with
an
agony
of
golden
light
which
even
my
dreamy
eyes
could
not
endure
and
i
awoke
weeping
for
joy
this
waking
woke
my
wife
who
said
in
some
alarm
what
is
the
matter
husband
so
i
told
her
my
dream
and
how
in
my
sleep
my
gladness
had
overcome
me
it
was
this
little
darling
that
set
you
dreaming
so
she
said
and
turning
put
the
baby
in
my
arms
chapter
vi
the
new
baby
i
will
not
attempt
to
describe
the
astonishment
of
the
members
of
our
household
each
in
succession
as
the
news
of
the
child
spread
charlie
was
heard
shouting
across
the
to
his
brother
harry
harry
mamma
has
got
a
new
baby
isn
t
it
jolly
where
did
she
get
it
cried
harry
in
return
in
the
i
suppose
answered
charlie
and
was
nearer
right
than
usual
for
the
information
on
which
his
conclusion
was
founded
had
no
doubt
been
imparted
as
belonging
to
the
history
of
the
human
race
but
my
reader
can
easily
imagine
the
utter
bewilderment
of
those
of
the
family
whose
knowledge
of
human
affairs
would
not
allow
of
their
curiosity
being
so
easily
satisfied
as
that
of
the
boys
in
them
was
exemplified
that
confusion
of
the
intellectual
being
which
is
produced
by
the
witness
of
incontestable
truth
to
a
thing
incredible
in
which
case
the
probability
always
is
that
the
incredibility
results
from
something
in
the
mind
of
the
hearer
falsely
associated
with
and
disturbing
the
true
perception
of
the
thing
to
which
witness
is
borne
nor
was
the
astonishment
confined
to
the
family
for
it
spread
over
the
parish
that
walton
had
got
another
baby
and
so
indeed
she
had
and
seldom
has
baby
met
with
a
more
hearty
welcome
than
this
baby
met
with
from
everyone
of
our
family
they
hugged
it
first
and
then
asked
questions
and
that
i
say
is
the
right
way
of
receiving
every
good
gift
of
god
ask
what
questions
you
will
but
when
you
see
that
the
gift
is
a
good
one
make
sure
that
you
take
it
there
is
plenty
of
time
for
you
to
ask
questions
afterwards
then
the
better
you
love
the
gift
the
more
ready
you
will
be
to
ask
and
the
more
fearless
in
asking
the
truth
however
soon
became
known
and
then
strange
to
relate
we
began
to
receive
visits
of
condolence
o
that
poor
baby
how
it
was
frowned
upon
and
how
it
had
heads
shaken
over
it
just
because
it
was
not
ethelwyn
s
baby
it
could
not
help
that
poor
darling
of
course
you
ll
give
information
to
the
police
said
i
am
sorry
to
say
one
of
my
brethren
in
the
neighbourhood
who
had
the
misfortune
to
be
a
magistrate
as
well
why
i
asked
why
that
they
may
discover
the
parents
to
be
wouldn
t
it
be
as
hard
a
matter
to
prove
the
parentage
as
it
would
be
easy
to
suspect
it
i
asked
and
just
think
what
it
would
be
to
give
the
baby
to
a
woman
who
not
only
did
not
want
her
but
who
was
not
her
mother
but
if
her
own
mother
came
to
claim
her
now
i
don
t
say
i
would
refuse
her
but
i
should
think
twice
about
giving
her
up
after
she
had
once
abandoned
her
for
a
whole
night
in
the
open
air
in
fact
i
don
t
want
the
but
you
don
t
want
the
how
do
you
know
that
i
returned
rather
rudely
i
am
afraid
for
i
am
easily
annoyed
at
anything
that
seems
to
me
heartless
about
children
especially
o
of
course
if
you
want
to
have
an
orphan
asylum
of
your
own
no
one
has
a
right
to
interfere
but
you
ought
to
consider
other
that
is
just
what
i
thought
i
was
doing
i
answered
but
he
went
on
without
heeding
my
reply
we
shall
all
be
having
babies
left
at
our
doors
and
some
of
us
are
not
so
fond
of
them
as
you
are
remember
you
are
your
brother
s
and
my
sister
s
too
i
answered
and
if
the
question
lies
between
keeping
a
big
burly
brother
like
you
and
a
tiny
wee
sister
like
that
i
venture
to
choose
for
she
ought
to
go
to
the
workhouse
said
the
magistrate
a
friendly
man
enough
in
ordinary
and
rising
he
took
his
hat
and
departed
this
man
had
no
children
so
he
was
or
was
not
so
much
to
blame
which
say
the
latter
some
of
ethelwyn
s
friends
were
no
less
positive
about
her
duty
in
the
affair
i
happened
to
go
into
the
during
the
visit
of
one
of
them
miss
bowdler
but
my
dear
walton
she
was
saying
you
ll
be
having
all
the
tramps
in
england
leaving
their
babies
at
your
the
better
for
the
babies
interposed
i
laughing
but
you
don
t
think
of
your
wife
don
t
i
i
thought
i
did
i
returned
dryly
depend
upon
it
you
ll
repent
i
hope
i
shall
never
repent
of
anything
but
what
is
ah
but
really
it
s
not
a
thing
to
be
made
game
certainly
not
the
baby
shall
be
treated
with
all
due
respect
in
this
what
a
provoking
man
you
are
you
know
what
i
mean
well
as
well
as
i
choose
to
know
certainly
i
answered
this
lady
was
one
of
my
oldest
parishioners
and
took
liberties
for
which
she
had
no
other
justification
except
indeed
an
unhesitating
belief
in
the
superior
rectitude
of
whatever
came
into
her
own
head
can
be
counted
as
one
when
she
was
gone
my
wife
turned
to
me
with
a
look
and
said
but
it
would
be
rather
alarming
harry
if
this
were
to
get
abroad
and
we
couldn
t
go
out
at
the
door
in
the
morning
without
being
in
danger
of
stepping
on
a
baby
on
the
you
might
as
well
have
said
when
you
were
going
to
be
married
if
god
should
send
me
twenty
children
whatever
should
i
do
he
who
sent
us
this
one
can
surely
prevent
any
more
from
coming
than
he
wants
to
come
all
that
we
have
to
think
of
is
to
do
right
not
the
consequences
of
doing
right
but
leaving
all
that
aside
you
must
not
suppose
that
wandering
mothers
have
not
even
the
attachment
of
animals
to
their
offspring
there
are
not
so
many
that
are
willing
to
part
with
babies
as
all
that
would
come
to
if
you
believe
that
god
sent
this
one
that
is
enough
for
the
present
if
he
should
send
another
we
should
know
by
that
that
we
had
to
take
it
my
wife
said
the
baby
was
a
beauty
i
could
see
that
she
was
a
plump
baby
and
being
by
nature
no
particular
lover
of
babies
as
babies
that
is
feeling
none
of
the
inclination
of
mothers
and
nurses
and
elder
sisters
to
eat
them
or
rather
perhaps
loving
more
for
what
i
believed
than
what
i
saw
that
was
all
i
could
pretend
to
discover
but
even
the
aforementioned
elderly
parishioner
was
compelled
to
allow
before
three
months
were
over
that
little
theodora
for
we
turned
the
name
of
my
youngest
daughter
upside
down
for
her
was
a
proper
to
none
however
did
she
seem
to
bring
so
much
delight
as
to
our
dear
constance
oftener
than
not
when
i
went
into
her
room
i
found
the
sleepy
useless
little
thing
lying
beside
her
on
the
bed
and
her
staring
at
it
with
such
loving
eyes
how
it
began
i
do
not
know
but
it
came
at
last
to
be
called
connie
s
dora
or
miss
connie
s
baby
all
over
the
house
and
nothing
pleased
connie
better
not
till
she
saw
this
did
her
old
nurse
take
quite
kindly
to
the
infant
for
she
regarded
her
as
an
interloper
who
had
no
right
to
the
tenderness
which
was
lavished
upon
her
but
she
had
no
sooner
given
in
than
the
baby
began
to
grow
dear
to
her
as
well
as
to
the
rest
in
fact
the
house
was
ere
long
full
of
nurses
the
staff
included
everyone
but
myself
who
only
occasionally
at
the
entreaty
of
some
one
or
other
of
the
younger
ones
took
her
in
my
arms
but
before
she
was
three
months
old
anxious
thoughts
began
to
intrude
all
centering
round
the
question
in
what
manner
the
child
was
to
be
brought
up
certainly
there
was
time
enough
to
think
of
this
as
ethelwyn
constantly
reminded
me
but
what
made
me
anxious
was
that
i
could
not
discover
the
principle
that
ought
to
guide
me
now
no
one
can
tell
how
soon
a
principle
in
such
a
case
will
begin
even
unconsciously
to
operate
and
the
danger
was
that
the
moment
when
it
ought
to
begin
to
operate
would
be
long
past
before
the
principle
was
discovered
except
i
did
what
i
could
now
to
find
it
out
i
had
again
and
again
to
remind
myself
that
there
was
no
cause
for
anxiety
for
that
i
might
certainly
claim
the
enlightenment
which
all
who
want
to
do
right
are
sure
to
receive
but
still
i
continued
uneasy
just
from
feeling
a
vacancy
where
a
principle
ought
to
have
been
chapter
vii
another
sunday
evening
during
all
this
time
connie
made
no
very
perceptible
progress
in
the
recovery
of
her
bodily
powers
i
mean
for
her
heart
and
mind
advanced
remarkably
we
held
our
assemblies
in
her
room
pretty
regularly
my
occasional
absence
in
the
exercise
of
my
duties
alone
interfering
with
them
in
connection
with
one
of
these
i
will
show
how
i
came
at
length
to
make
up
my
mind
as
to
what
i
would
endeavour
to
keep
before
me
as
my
object
in
the
training
of
little
theodora
always
remembering
that
my
preparation
might
be
used
for
a
very
different
end
from
what
i
purposed
if
my
intention
was
right
the
fact
that
it
might
be
turned
aside
would
not
trouble
me
we
had
spoken
a
good
deal
together
about
the
infancy
and
childhood
of
jesus
about
the
shepherds
and
the
wise
men
and
the
star
in
the
east
and
the
children
of
bethlehem
i
encouraged
the
thoughts
of
all
the
children
to
rest
and
brood
upon
the
fragments
that
are
given
us
and
believing
that
the
imagination
is
one
of
the
most
powerful
of
all
the
faculties
for
aiding
the
growth
of
truth
in
the
mind
i
would
ask
them
questions
as
to
what
they
thought
he
might
have
said
or
done
in
ordinary
family
occurrences
thus
giving
a
reality
in
their
minds
to
this
part
of
his
history
and
trying
to
rouse
in
them
a
habit
of
referring
their
conduct
to
the
standard
of
his
if
we
do
not
thus
employ
our
imagination
on
sacred
things
his
example
can
be
of
no
use
to
us
except
in
exactly
corresponding
circumstances
and
when
can
such
occur
from
one
end
to
another
of
our
lives
the
very
effort
to
think
how
he
would
have
done
is
a
wonderful
purifier
of
the
conscience
and
even
if
the
conclusion
arrived
at
should
not
be
correct
from
lack
of
sufficient
knowledge
of
his
character
and
principles
it
will
be
better
than
any
that
can
be
arrived
at
without
this
inquiry
besides
the
asking
of
such
questions
gave
me
good
opportunity
through
the
answers
they
returned
of
seeing
what
their
notions
of
jesus
and
of
duty
were
and
thus
of
discovering
how
to
help
the
dawn
of
the
light
in
their
growing
minds
nor
let
anyone
fear
that
such
employment
of
the
divine
gift
of
imagination
will
lead
to
foolish
vagaries
and
useless
inventions
while
the
object
is
to
discover
the
right
way
the
truth
there
is
little
danger
of
that
besides
there
i
was
to
help
hereby
in
the
actual
training
of
their
imaginations
to
truth
and
wisdom
to
aid
in
this
i
told
them
some
of
the
stories
that
were
circulated
about
him
in
the
early
centuries
of
the
church
but
which
the
church
has
rejected
as
of
no
authority
and
i
showed
them
how
some
of
them
could
not
be
true
because
they
were
so
unlike
those
words
and
actions
which
we
had
the
best
of
reasons
for
receiving
as
true
and
how
one
or
two
of
them
might
be
true
though
considering
the
company
in
which
we
found
them
we
could
say
nothing
for
certain
concerning
them
and
such
wise
things
as
those
children
said
sometimes
it
is
marvellous
how
children
can
reach
the
heart
of
the
truth
at
once
their
utterances
are
sometimes
entirely
concordant
with
the
results
arrived
at
through
years
of
thought
by
the
earnest
mind
results
which
no
mind
would
ever
arrive
at
save
by
virtue
of
the
in
it
well
then
upon
this
evening
i
read
to
them
the
story
of
the
boy
jesus
in
the
temple
then
i
sought
to
make
the
story
more
real
to
them
by
dwelling
a
little
on
the
growing
fears
of
his
parents
as
they
went
from
group
to
group
of
their
friends
tracing
back
the
road
towards
jerusalem
and
asking
every
fresh
company
they
knew
if
they
had
seen
their
boy
till
at
length
they
were
in
great
trouble
when
they
could
not
find
him
even
in
jerusalem
then
came
the
delight
of
his
mother
when
she
did
find
him
at
last
and
his
answer
to
what
she
said
now
while
i
thus
lingered
over
the
simple
story
my
children
had
put
many
questions
to
me
about
jesus
being
a
boy
and
not
seeming
to
know
things
which
if
he
was
god
he
must
have
known
they
thought
to
some
of
these
i
had
just
to
reply
that
i
did
not
understand
myself
and
therefore
could
not
teach
them
to
others
that
i
could
explain
them
but
that
they
were
not
yet
some
of
them
old
enough
to
receive
and
understand
my
explanation
while
others
i
did
my
best
to
answer
as
simply
as
i
could
but
at
this
point
we
arrived
at
a
question
put
by
wynnie
to
answer
which
aright
i
considered
of
the
greatest
importance
wynnie
said
that
is
just
one
of
the
things
about
jesus
that
have
always
troubled
me
what
is
my
dear
i
said
for
although
i
thought
i
knew
well
enough
what
she
meant
i
wished
her
to
set
it
forth
in
her
own
words
both
for
her
own
sake
and
the
sake
of
the
others
who
would
probably
understand
the
difficulty
much
better
if
she
presented
it
herself
i
mean
that
he
spoke
to
his
mother
why
don
t
you
say
wynnie
said
charlie
she
was
his
own
mamma
wasn
t
she
papa
yes
my
dear
but
don
t
you
know
that
the
shoemaker
s
children
down
in
the
village
always
call
their
mamma
yes
but
they
are
shoemaker
s
well
jesus
was
one
of
that
class
of
people
he
was
the
son
of
a
carpenter
he
called
his
mamma
but
charlie
is
the
more
beautiful
word
of
the
two
by
a
great
deal
i
think
is
a
very
pretty
word
but
is
a
very
beautiful
word
just
so
with
and
is
pretty
but
is
why
don
t
we
always
say
then
just
because
it
is
the
most
beautiful
and
so
we
keep
it
for
sundays
that
is
for
the
more
solemn
times
of
life
we
don
t
want
it
to
get
common
to
us
with
too
much
use
we
may
think
it
as
much
as
we
like
thinking
does
not
spoil
it
but
saying
spoils
many
things
and
especially
beautiful
words
now
we
must
let
wynnie
finish
what
she
was
i
was
saying
papa
that
i
can
t
help
feeling
as
if
i
know
it
can
t
be
true
but
i
feel
as
if
jesus
spoke
unkindly
to
his
mother
when
he
said
that
to
i
looked
at
the
page
and
read
the
words
how
is
it
that
ye
sought
me
wist
ye
not
that
i
must
be
about
my
father
s
business
and
i
sat
silent
for
a
while
why
don
t
you
speak
papa
said
harry
i
am
sitting
wondering
at
myself
harry
i
said
long
after
i
was
your
age
wynnie
i
remember
quite
well
that
those
words
troubled
me
as
they
now
trouble
you
but
when
i
read
them
over
now
they
seemed
to
me
so
lovely
that
i
could
hardly
read
them
aloud
i
can
recall
the
fact
that
they
troubled
me
but
the
mode
of
the
fact
i
scarcely
can
recall
i
can
hardly
see
now
wherein
lay
the
hurt
or
offence
the
words
gave
me
and
why
is
that
simply
because
i
understand
them
now
and
i
did
not
understand
them
then
i
took
them
as
uttered
with
a
tone
of
reproof
now
i
hear
them
as
uttered
with
a
tone
of
loving
surprise
but
really
i
can
not
feel
sure
what
it
was
that
i
did
not
like
and
i
am
confident
it
is
so
with
a
great
many
things
that
we
reject
we
reject
them
simply
because
we
do
not
understand
them
therefore
indeed
we
can
not
with
truth
be
said
to
reject
them
at
all
it
is
some
false
appearance
that
we
reject
some
of
the
grandest
things
in
the
whole
realm
of
truth
look
repellent
to
us
and
we
turn
away
from
them
simply
because
we
are
not
to
use
a
familiar
phrase
we
are
not
up
to
them
they
appear
to
us
therefore
to
be
what
they
are
not
instruction
sounds
to
the
proud
man
like
reproof
illumination
comes
on
the
vain
man
like
scorn
the
manifestation
of
a
higher
condition
of
motive
and
action
than
his
own
falls
on
the
like
condemnation
but
it
is
consciousness
and
conscience
working
together
that
produce
this
impression
the
result
is
from
the
man
himself
not
from
the
higher
source
from
the
truth
comes
the
power
but
the
shape
it
assumes
to
the
man
is
from
the
man
you
are
quite
beyond
me
now
papa
said
wynnie
well
my
dear
i
answered
i
will
return
to
the
words
of
the
boy
jesus
instead
of
talking
more
about
them
and
when
i
have
shown
you
what
they
mean
i
think
you
will
allow
that
that
feeling
you
have
about
them
is
all
and
altogether
an
there
is
one
thing
first
said
connie
that
i
want
to
understand
you
said
the
words
of
jesus
rather
indicated
surprise
but
how
could
he
be
surprised
at
anything
if
he
was
god
he
must
have
known
he
tells
us
himself
that
he
did
not
know
everything
he
says
once
that
even
did
not
know
one
thing
only
the
father
knew
but
how
could
that
be
if
he
was
god
my
dear
that
is
one
of
the
things
that
it
seems
to
me
impossible
i
should
understand
certainly
i
think
his
trial
as
a
man
would
not
have
been
perfect
had
he
known
everything
he
too
had
to
live
by
faith
in
the
father
and
remember
that
for
the
divine
sonship
on
earth
perfect
knowledge
was
not
necessary
only
perfect
confidence
absolute
obedience
utter
holiness
there
is
a
great
tendency
in
our
sinful
natures
to
put
knowledge
and
power
on
a
level
with
goodness
it
was
one
of
the
lessons
of
our
lord
s
life
that
they
are
not
so
that
the
one
grand
thing
in
humanity
is
faith
in
god
that
the
highest
in
god
is
his
truth
his
goodness
his
rightness
but
if
jesus
was
a
real
man
and
no
mere
appearance
of
a
man
is
it
any
wonder
that
with
a
heart
full
to
the
brim
of
the
love
of
god
he
should
be
for
a
moment
surprised
that
his
mother
whom
he
loved
so
dearly
the
best
human
being
he
knew
should
not
have
taken
it
as
a
matter
of
course
that
if
he
was
not
with
her
he
must
be
doing
something
his
father
wanted
him
to
do
for
this
is
just
what
his
answer
means
to
turn
it
into
the
ordinary
speech
of
our
day
it
is
just
this
why
did
you
look
for
me
didn
t
you
know
that
i
must
of
course
be
doing
something
my
father
had
given
me
to
do
just
think
of
the
quiet
sweetness
of
confidence
in
this
and
think
what
a
life
his
must
have
been
up
to
that
twelfth
year
of
his
that
such
an
expostulation
with
his
mother
was
justified
it
must
have
had
reference
to
a
good
many
things
that
had
passed
before
then
which
ought
to
have
been
sufficient
to
make
mary
conclude
that
her
missing
boy
must
be
about
god
s
business
somewhere
if
her
heart
had
been
as
full
of
god
and
god
s
business
as
his
she
would
not
have
been
in
the
least
uneasy
about
him
and
here
is
the
lesson
of
his
whole
life
it
was
all
his
father
s
business
the
boy
s
mind
and
hands
were
full
of
it
the
man
s
mind
and
hands
were
full
of
it
and
the
risen
conqueror
was
full
of
it
still
for
the
father
s
business
is
everything
and
includes
all
work
that
is
worth
doing
we
may
say
in
a
full
grand
sense
that
there
is
nothing
but
the
father
and
his
but
we
have
so
many
things
to
do
that
are
not
his
business
said
wynnie
with
a
sigh
of
oppression
not
one
my
darling
if
anything
is
not
his
business
you
not
only
have
not
to
do
it
but
you
ought
not
to
do
it
your
words
come
from
the
want
of
spiritual
sight
we
can
not
see
the
truth
in
common
things
the
will
of
god
in
little
everyday
affairs
and
that
is
how
they
become
so
irksome
to
us
show
a
beautiful
picture
one
full
of
quiet
imagination
and
deep
thought
to
a
man
he
will
pass
it
by
with
some
slight
remark
thinking
it
very
ordinary
and
commonplace
that
is
because
he
is
commonplace
because
our
minds
are
so
commonplace
have
so
little
of
the
divine
imagination
in
them
therefore
we
do
not
recognise
the
spiritual
meaning
and
worth
we
do
not
perceive
the
beautiful
will
of
god
in
the
things
required
of
us
though
they
are
full
of
it
but
if
we
do
them
we
shall
thus
make
acquaintance
with
them
and
come
to
see
what
is
in
them
the
roughest
kernel
amongst
them
has
a
tree
of
life
in
its
i
wish
he
would
tell
me
something
to
do
said
charlie
wouldn
t
i
do
it
i
made
no
reply
but
waited
for
an
opportunity
which
i
was
pretty
sure
was
at
hand
while
i
carried
the
matter
a
little
further
but
look
here
wynnie
listen
to
this
i
said
and
he
went
down
with
them
and
came
to
nazareth
and
was
subject
unto
was
that
not
doing
his
father
s
business
too
was
it
not
doing
the
business
of
his
father
in
heaven
to
honour
his
father
and
his
mother
though
he
knew
that
his
days
would
not
be
long
in
that
land
did
not
his
whole
teaching
his
whole
doing
rest
on
the
relation
of
the
son
to
the
father
and
surely
it
was
doing
his
father
s
business
then
to
obey
his
parents
to
serve
them
to
be
subject
to
them
it
is
true
that
the
business
god
gives
a
man
to
do
may
be
said
to
be
the
peculiar
walk
in
life
into
which
he
is
led
but
that
is
only
as
distinguishing
it
from
another
man
s
peculiar
business
god
gives
us
all
our
business
and
the
business
which
is
common
to
humanity
is
more
peculiarly
god
s
business
than
that
which
is
one
man
s
and
not
another
s
because
it
lies
nearer
the
root
and
is
essential
it
does
not
matter
whether
a
man
is
a
farmer
or
a
physician
but
it
greatly
matters
whether
he
is
a
good
son
a
good
husband
and
so
on
o
my
children
i
said
if
the
world
could
but
be
brought
to
believe
the
world
did
i
say
if
the
best
men
in
the
world
could
only
see
as
god
sees
it
that
service
is
in
itself
the
noblest
exercise
of
human
powers
if
they
could
see
that
god
is
the
hardest
worker
of
all
and
that
his
nobility
are
those
who
do
the
most
service
surely
it
would
alter
the
whole
aspect
of
the
church
menial
offices
for
instance
would
soon
cease
to
be
talked
of
with
that
contempt
which
shows
that
there
is
no
true
recognition
of
the
fact
that
the
same
principle
runs
through
the
highest
duty
and
the
lowest
that
the
lowest
work
which
god
gives
a
man
to
do
must
be
in
its
nature
noble
as
certainly
noble
as
the
highest
this
would
destroy
condescension
which
is
the
rudeness
yes
impertinence
of
the
higher
as
it
would
destroy
insolence
which
is
the
rudeness
of
the
lower
he
who
recognised
the
dignity
of
his
own
lower
office
would
thereby
recognise
the
superiority
of
the
higher
office
and
would
be
the
last
either
to
envy
or
degrade
it
he
would
see
in
it
his
own
only
higher
only
better
and
revere
it
but
i
am
afraid
i
have
wearied
you
my
o
no
papa
said
the
elder
ones
while
the
little
ones
gaped
and
said
nothing
i
know
i
am
in
danger
of
doing
so
when
i
come
to
speak
upon
this
subject
it
has
such
a
hold
of
my
heart
and
mind
now
charlie
my
boy
go
to
but
charlie
was
very
comfortable
before
the
fire
on
the
rug
and
did
not
want
to
go
first
one
shoulder
went
up
and
then
the
other
and
the
corners
of
his
mouth
went
down
as
if
to
keep
the
balance
true
he
did
not
move
to
go
i
gave
him
a
few
moments
to
recover
himself
but
as
the
black
frost
still
endured
i
thought
it
was
time
to
hold
up
a
mirror
to
him
when
he
was
a
very
little
boy
he
was
much
in
the
habit
of
getting
out
of
temper
and
then
as
now
he
made
a
face
that
was
hideous
to
behold
and
to
cure
him
of
this
i
used
to
make
him
carry
a
little
mirror
about
his
neck
that
the
means
might
be
always
at
hand
of
showing
himself
to
him
it
was
a
sort
of
artificial
conscience
which
by
enabling
him
to
see
the
picture
of
his
own
condition
which
the
face
always
is
was
not
unfrequently
operative
in
rousing
his
real
conscience
and
making
him
ashamed
of
himself
but
now
the
mirror
i
wanted
to
hold
up
to
him
was
a
past
mood
in
the
light
of
which
the
present
would
show
what
it
was
charlie
i
said
a
little
while
ago
you
were
wishing
that
god
would
give
you
something
to
do
and
now
when
he
does
you
refuse
at
once
without
even
thinking
about
how
do
you
know
that
god
wants
me
to
go
to
bed
said
charlie
with
something
of
surly
impertinence
which
i
did
not
meet
with
reproof
at
once
because
there
was
some
sense
along
with
the
impudence
i
know
that
god
wants
you
to
do
what
i
tell
you
and
to
do
it
pleasantly
do
you
think
the
boy
jesus
would
have
put
on
such
a
face
as
that
i
wish
i
had
the
little
mirror
to
show
it
to
you
when
his
mother
told
him
it
was
time
to
go
to
bed
and
now
charlie
began
to
look
ashamed
i
left
the
truth
to
work
in
him
because
i
saw
it
was
working
had
i
not
seen
that
i
should
have
compelled
him
to
go
at
once
that
he
might
learn
the
majesty
of
law
but
now
that
his
own
better
self
the
self
enlightened
of
the
light
that
lighteneth
every
man
that
cometh
into
the
world
was
working
time
might
well
be
afforded
it
to
work
its
perfect
work
i
went
on
talking
to
the
others
in
the
space
of
not
more
than
one
minute
he
rose
and
came
to
me
looking
both
good
and
ashamed
and
held
up
his
face
to
kiss
me
saying
goodnight
i
bade
him
and
kissed
him
more
tenderly
than
usual
that
he
might
know
that
it
was
all
right
between
us
i
required
no
formal
apology
no
begging
of
my
pardon
as
some
parents
think
right
it
seemed
enough
to
me
that
his
heart
was
turned
it
is
a
terrible
thing
to
run
the
risk
of
changing
humility
into
humiliation
humiliation
is
one
of
the
proudest
conditions
in
the
human
world
when
he
felt
that
it
would
be
a
relief
to
say
more
explicitly
father
i
have
sinned
then
let
him
say
it
but
not
till
then
to
compel
manifestation
is
one
surest
way
to
check
feeling
my
readers
must
not
judge
it
silly
to
record
a
boy
s
unwillingness
to
go
to
bed
it
is
precisely
the
same
kind
of
disobedience
that
some
of
them
are
guilty
of
themselves
and
that
in
things
not
one
whit
more
important
than
this
only
those
things
happen
to
be
wish
at
the
moment
and
not
charlie
s
and
so
gain
their
superiority
chapter
viii
theodora
s
doom
try
not
to
get
weary
respected
reader
of
so
much
of
what
i
am
afraid
most
people
will
call
tiresome
preaching
but
i
know
if
you
get
anything
practicable
out
of
it
you
will
not
be
so
soon
tired
of
it
i
promise
you
more
story
by
and
by
only
an
old
man
like
an
old
horse
must
be
allowed
to
take
very
much
his
own
way
go
his
own
pace
i
should
have
said
i
am
afraid
there
must
be
a
little
more
of
a
similar
sort
in
this
chapter
on
the
monday
morning
i
set
out
to
visit
one
or
two
people
whom
the
severity
of
the
weather
had
kept
from
church
on
the
sunday
the
last
severe
frost
as
it
turned
out
of
the
season
was
possessing
the
earth
the
sun
was
low
in
the
wintry
sky
and
what
seemed
a
very
cold
mist
up
in
the
air
hid
him
from
the
earth
i
was
walking
along
a
path
in
a
field
close
by
a
hedge
a
tree
had
been
cut
down
and
lay
upon
the
grass
a
short
distance
from
it
lay
its
own
figure
marked
out
in
there
alone
was
there
any
on
the
field
the
rest
was
all
of
the
loveliest
tenderest
green
i
will
not
say
the
figure
was
such
an
exact
resemblance
as
a
photograph
would
have
been
still
it
was
an
indubitable
likeness
it
appeared
to
the
hasty
glance
that
not
a
branch
not
a
knot
of
the
upper
side
of
the
tree
at
least
was
left
unrepresented
in
shining
and
glittering
whiteness
upon
the
green
grass
it
was
very
pretty
and
i
confess
at
first
very
puzzling
i
walked
on
meditating
on
the
phenomenon
till
at
length
i
found
out
its
cause
the
had
been
all
over
the
field
in
the
morning
the
sun
had
been
shining
for
a
time
and
had
melted
the
frost
away
except
where
he
could
only
cast
a
shadow
as
he
rose
and
rose
the
shadow
of
the
tree
had
shortened
and
come
nearer
and
nearer
to
its
original
growing
more
and
more
like
as
it
came
nearer
while
the
frost
kept
disappearing
as
the
shadow
withdrew
its
protection
when
the
shadow
extended
only
to
a
little
way
from
the
tree
the
clouds
came
and
covered
the
sun
and
there
were
no
more
shadows
only
one
great
one
of
the
clouds
then
the
frost
shone
out
in
the
shape
of
the
vanished
shadow
it
lay
at
a
little
distance
from
the
tree
because
the
tree
having
been
only
partially
lopped
some
great
stumps
of
boughs
held
it
up
from
the
ground
and
thus
when
the
sun
was
low
his
light
had
shone
a
little
way
through
beneath
as
well
as
over
the
trunk
my
reader
needs
not
be
afraid
i
am
not
going
to
moralise
this
spectacle
with
a
thousand
i
only
tell
it
him
as
a
very
pretty
phenomenon
but
i
confess
i
walked
on
moralising
it
any
new
thing
in
nature
i
mean
new
in
regard
to
my
knowledge
of
course
always
made
me
happy
and
i
was
full
of
the
quiet
pleasure
it
had
given
me
and
of
the
thoughts
it
had
brought
me
when
as
i
was
getting
over
a
stile
whom
should
i
see
in
the
next
field
coming
along
the
footpath
but
the
lady
who
had
made
herself
so
disagreeable
about
theodora
the
sight
was
rather
a
discord
in
my
feeling
at
that
moment
perhaps
it
would
have
been
so
at
any
moment
but
i
prepared
myself
to
meet
her
in
the
strength
of
the
good
humour
which
nature
had
just
bestowed
upon
me
for
i
fear
the
failing
will
go
with
me
to
the
grave
that
i
am
very
ready
to
be
annoyed
even
to
the
loss
of
my
temper
at
the
urgings
of
ignoble
prudence
miss
bowdler
i
said
walton
she
returned
i
am
afraid
you
thought
me
impertinent
the
other
week
but
you
know
by
this
time
it
is
only
my
as
such
i
take
it
i
answered
with
a
smile
she
did
not
seem
quite
satisfied
that
i
did
not
defend
her
from
her
own
accusation
but
as
it
was
a
just
one
i
could
not
do
so
therefore
she
went
on
to
repeat
the
offence
by
way
of
justification
it
was
all
for
walton
s
sake
you
ought
to
consider
her
walton
she
has
quite
enough
to
do
with
that
dear
connie
who
is
likely
to
be
an
invalid
all
her
days
too
much
to
take
the
trouble
of
a
beggar
s
brat
as
has
walton
been
complaining
to
you
about
it
miss
bowdler
i
asked
o
dear
no
she
answered
she
is
far
too
good
to
complain
of
anything
that
s
just
why
her
friends
must
look
after
her
a
bit
then
i
beg
you
won
t
speak
disrespectfully
of
my
little
o
dear
me
no
not
at
all
i
don
t
speak
disrespectfully
of
even
amongst
the
class
of
which
she
comes
a
beggar
s
brat
would
be
regarded
as
bad
i
beg
your
pardon
i
m
sure
walton
if
you
take
offence
i
do
take
offence
and
you
know
there
is
one
who
has
given
especial
warning
against
offending
the
little
miss
bowdler
walked
away
in
high
displeasure
let
me
hope
in
conviction
of
sin
as
well
she
did
not
appear
in
church
for
the
next
two
sundays
then
she
came
again
but
she
called
very
seldom
at
the
hall
after
this
and
i
believe
my
wife
was
not
sorry
now
whether
it
came
in
any
way
from
what
that
lady
had
said
as
to
my
wife
s
trouble
with
constance
and
theodora
together
i
can
hardly
tell
but
before
i
had
reached
home
i
had
at
last
got
a
glimpse
of
something
like
the
right
way
as
it
appeared
to
me
of
bringing
up
theodora
when
i
went
into
the
house
i
looked
for
my
wife
to
have
a
talk
with
her
about
it
but
indeed
it
always
necessary
to
find
her
every
time
i
got
home
i
found
her
in
connie
s
room
as
i
had
expected
now
although
we
were
never
in
the
habit
of
making
mysteries
of
things
in
which
there
was
no
mystery
and
talked
openly
before
our
children
and
the
more
openly
the
older
they
grew
yet
there
were
times
when
we
wanted
to
have
our
talks
quite
alone
especially
when
we
had
not
made
up
our
minds
about
something
so
i
asked
ethelwyn
to
walk
out
with
me
i
m
afraid
i
can
t
just
this
moment
husband
she
answered
she
was
in
the
way
of
using
that
form
of
address
for
she
said
it
meant
everything
without
saying
it
aloud
i
can
t
just
this
moment
for
there
is
no
one
at
liberty
to
stay
with
o
never
mind
me
mamma
said
connie
cheerfully
theodora
will
take
care
of
me
and
she
looked
fondly
at
the
child
who
was
lying
by
her
side
fast
asleep
there
i
said
and
both
looked
up
surprised
for
neither
knew
what
i
meant
i
will
tell
you
afterwards
i
said
laughing
come
along
you
can
ring
the
bell
you
know
connie
if
you
should
want
anything
or
your
baby
should
wake
up
and
be
troublesome
you
won
t
want
me
long
will
you
husband
i
m
not
sure
about
that
you
must
tell
susan
to
watch
for
the
susan
was
the
old
nurse
ethel
put
on
her
hooded
cloak
and
we
went
out
together
i
took
her
across
to
the
field
where
i
had
seen
the
hoary
shadow
the
sun
had
not
shone
out
and
i
hoped
it
would
be
there
to
gladden
her
dear
eyes
as
it
had
gladdened
mine
but
it
was
gone
the
warmth
of
the
sun
without
his
direct
rays
had
melted
it
away
as
sacred
influences
will
sometimes
do
with
other
shadows
without
the
mind
knowing
any
more
than
the
grass
how
the
shadow
departed
there
reader
i
have
got
a
bit
of
a
moral
in
about
it
before
you
knew
what
i
was
doing
but
i
was
sorry
my
wife
could
see
it
only
through
my
eyes
and
words
then
i
told
her
about
miss
bowdler
and
what
she
had
said
ethel
was
very
angry
at
her
impertinence
in
speaking
so
to
me
that
was
a
wife
s
feeling
you
know
and
perhaps
excusable
in
the
first
impression
of
the
thing
she
seems
to
think
she
said
that
she
was
sent
into
the
world
to
keep
other
people
right
instead
of
herself
i
am
very
glad
you
set
her
down
as
the
maids
o
i
don
t
think
there
s
much
harm
in
her
i
returned
which
was
easy
generosity
seeing
my
wife
was
taking
my
part
indeed
i
am
not
sure
that
we
are
not
both
considerably
indebted
to
her
for
it
was
after
i
met
her
that
a
thought
came
into
my
head
as
to
how
we
ought
to
do
with
still
troubling
yourself
about
that
husband
the
longer
the
difficulty
lasts
the
more
necessary
is
it
that
it
should
be
met
i
answered
our
measures
must
begin
sometime
and
when
who
can
tell
we
ought
to
have
them
in
our
heads
or
they
will
never
begin
at
well
i
confess
they
are
rather
of
a
general
nature
at
present
belonging
to
humanity
rather
than
the
individual
as
you
would
say
consisting
chiefly
in
washing
dressing
feeding
and
apostrophe
varied
with
lullabying
but
our
hearts
are
a
better
place
for
our
measures
than
our
heads
aren
t
they
certainly
i
walk
corrected
only
there
s
no
fear
about
your
heart
i
m
not
quite
so
sure
about
your
thank
you
husband
but
with
you
for
a
head
it
doesn
t
matter
does
it
i
don
t
know
that
people
should
always
strengthen
the
weaker
part
for
no
chain
is
stronger
than
its
weakest
link
no
fortification
stronger
than
its
most
assailable
point
but
seriously
wife
i
trust
your
head
nearly
though
not
quite
as
much
as
your
heart
now
to
go
to
business
there
s
one
thing
we
have
both
made
up
our
minds
about
that
there
is
to
be
no
concealment
with
the
child
god
s
fact
must
be
known
by
her
it
would
be
cruel
to
keep
the
truth
from
her
even
if
it
were
not
sure
to
come
upon
her
with
a
terrible
shock
some
day
she
must
know
from
the
first
by
hearing
it
talked
of
not
by
solemn
and
private
communication
that
she
came
out
of
the
shrubbery
that
s
settled
is
it
not
certainly
i
see
that
to
be
the
right
way
responded
ethelwyn
now
are
we
bound
to
bring
her
up
exactly
as
our
own
or
are
we
not
we
are
bound
to
do
as
well
for
her
as
for
our
assuredly
but
if
we
brought
her
up
just
as
our
own
would
that
the
facts
being
as
they
are
be
to
do
as
well
for
her
as
for
our
own
i
doubt
it
for
other
people
would
not
choose
to
receive
her
as
we
have
that
is
true
she
would
be
continually
reminded
of
her
origin
not
that
that
in
itself
would
be
any
evil
but
as
they
would
do
it
by
excluding
or
neglecting
her
or
still
worse
by
taking
liberties
with
her
it
would
be
a
great
pain
but
keeping
that
out
of
view
would
it
be
good
for
herself
knowing
what
she
will
know
to
be
thus
brought
up
would
it
not
be
kinder
to
bring
her
up
in
a
way
that
would
make
it
easier
for
her
to
relieve
the
gratitude
which
i
trust
she
will
feel
not
for
our
sakes
i
hope
we
are
above
doing
anything
for
the
sake
of
the
gratitude
which
will
be
given
for
it
and
which
is
so
often
far
beyond
the
worth
of
the
thing
done
alas
the
gratitude
of
men
hath
oftener
left
me
mourning
said
ethel
ah
you
understand
that
now
my
ethel
yes
thank
you
i
but
we
must
wish
for
gratitude
for
others
sake
though
we
may
be
willing
to
go
without
it
for
our
own
indeed
gratitude
is
often
just
as
painful
as
wordsworth
there
represents
it
it
makes
us
so
ashamed
makes
us
think
how
much
more
we
have
done
how
lovely
a
thing
it
is
to
give
in
return
for
such
common
gifts
as
ours
how
needy
the
man
or
woman
must
be
in
whom
a
trifle
awakes
so
much
yes
but
we
must
not
in
justice
think
that
it
is
merely
that
our
little
doing
seems
great
to
them
it
is
the
kindness
shown
them
therein
for
which
often
they
are
more
grateful
than
for
the
gift
though
they
can
t
show
the
difference
in
their
and
indeed
are
not
aware
of
it
themselves
though
it
is
so
and
yet
the
same
remarks
hold
good
about
the
kindness
as
about
the
gift
but
to
return
to
theodora
if
we
put
her
in
a
way
of
life
that
would
be
recognisant
of
whence
she
came
and
how
she
had
been
brought
thence
might
it
not
be
better
for
her
would
it
not
be
building
on
the
truth
would
she
not
be
happier
for
it
you
are
putting
general
propositions
while
all
the
time
you
have
something
particular
and
definite
in
your
own
mind
and
that
is
not
fair
to
my
place
in
the
conference
said
ethel
in
fact
you
think
you
are
trying
to
approach
me
wisely
in
order
to
persuade
i
will
not
say
me
into
something
it
s
a
good
thing
you
have
the
harmlessness
of
the
dove
harry
for
you
ve
got
the
other
well
then
i
will
be
as
plain
as
ever
i
can
be
only
premising
that
what
you
call
the
cunning
of
the
serpent
wisdom
harry
not
is
only
that
i
like
to
give
my
arguments
before
my
proposition
but
here
it
is
bare
and
defenceless
only
let
me
warn
you
with
a
whole
battery
behind
it
it
is
to
bring
up
little
theodora
as
a
servant
to
my
wife
laughed
well
she
said
for
one
who
says
so
much
about
not
thinking
of
the
morrow
you
do
look
rather
far
not
with
any
anxiety
however
if
only
i
know
that
i
am
doing
but
just
think
the
child
is
about
three
months
well
connie
will
be
none
the
worse
that
she
is
being
trained
for
her
i
don
t
say
that
she
is
to
commence
her
duties
at
but
connie
may
be
at
the
head
of
a
house
of
her
own
long
before
the
training
won
t
be
lost
to
the
child
though
but
i
much
fear
my
love
that
connie
will
never
be
herself
again
there
is
no
sign
of
it
and
turner
does
not
give
much
o
harry
harry
don
t
say
so
i
can
t
bear
it
to
think
of
the
darling
child
lying
like
that
all
her
life
it
is
sad
indeed
but
no
such
awful
misfortune
surely
ethel
haven
t
you
seen
as
well
as
i
that
the
growth
of
that
child
s
nature
since
her
accident
has
been
marvellous
ten
times
rather
would
i
have
her
lying
there
such
as
she
is
than
have
her
well
and
strong
and
silly
with
her
bonnets
inside
instead
of
outside
her
yes
but
she
needn
t
have
been
like
that
wynnie
never
well
but
god
does
all
things
not
only
well
but
best
absolutely
best
but
just
think
what
it
would
be
in
any
circumstances
to
have
a
maid
that
had
begun
to
wait
upon
her
from
the
first
days
that
she
was
able
to
toddle
after
something
to
fetch
it
for
won
t
it
be
like
making
a
slave
of
her
won
t
it
be
like
giving
her
a
divine
freedom
from
the
first
the
lack
of
service
is
the
ruin
of
but
we
can
t
train
her
then
like
one
of
our
why
not
could
we
not
give
her
all
the
love
and
all
the
teaching
because
it
would
not
be
fair
to
give
her
the
education
of
a
lady
and
then
make
a
servant
of
you
forget
that
the
service
would
be
part
of
her
training
from
the
first
and
she
would
know
no
change
of
position
in
it
when
we
tell
her
that
she
was
found
in
the
shrubbery
we
will
add
that
we
think
god
sent
her
to
take
care
of
constance
i
do
not
believe
myself
that
you
can
have
perfect
service
except
from
a
lady
do
not
forget
the
true
notion
of
service
as
the
essence
of
christianity
yea
of
divinity
it
is
not
education
that
unfits
for
service
it
is
the
want
of
well
i
know
that
the
reading
girls
i
have
had
have
as
a
rule
served
me
worse
than
the
would
you
have
called
one
of
those
girls
educated
or
even
if
they
had
been
educated
as
any
of
them
might
well
have
been
better
than
of
the
girls
that
go
to
you
must
remember
that
they
had
never
been
taught
service
the
highest
accomplishment
of
all
to
that
everything
aids
when
any
true
feeling
of
it
is
there
but
for
service
of
this
high
sort
the
education
must
begin
with
the
beginning
of
the
dawn
of
will
how
often
have
you
wished
that
you
had
servants
who
would
believe
in
you
and
serve
you
with
the
same
truth
with
which
you
regarded
them
the
servants
born
in
a
man
s
house
in
the
old
times
were
more
like
his
children
than
his
servants
here
is
a
chance
for
you
as
it
were
of
a
servant
born
in
your
own
house
connie
loves
the
child
the
child
will
love
connie
and
find
her
delight
in
serving
her
like
a
little
cherub
not
one
of
the
maids
to
whom
you
have
referred
had
ever
been
taught
to
think
service
other
than
an
unavoidable
necessity
the
end
of
life
being
to
serve
yourself
not
to
serve
others
and
hence
most
of
them
would
escape
from
it
by
any
marriage
almost
that
they
had
a
chance
of
making
i
don
t
say
all
servants
are
like
that
but
i
do
think
that
most
of
them
are
i
know
very
well
that
most
mistresses
are
as
much
to
blame
for
this
result
as
the
servants
are
but
we
are
not
talking
about
them
servants
nowadays
despise
work
and
yet
are
forced
to
do
it
a
most
degrading
condition
to
be
in
but
they
would
not
be
in
any
better
condition
if
delivered
from
the
work
the
lady
who
despises
work
is
in
as
bad
a
condition
as
they
are
the
only
way
to
set
them
free
is
to
get
them
to
regard
service
not
only
as
their
duty
but
as
therefore
honourable
and
besides
and
beyond
this
in
its
own
nature
divine
in
america
the
very
name
of
servant
is
repudiated
as
inconsistent
with
human
dignity
there
is
dignity
but
of
service
how
different
the
whole
notion
of
training
is
now
from
what
it
was
in
the
middle
ages
service
was
honourable
then
no
doubt
we
have
made
progress
as
a
whole
but
in
some
things
we
have
degenerated
sadly
the
first
thing
taught
then
was
how
to
serve
no
man
could
rise
to
the
honour
of
knighthood
without
service
a
nobleman
s
son
even
had
to
wait
on
his
father
or
to
go
into
the
family
of
another
nobleman
and
wait
upon
him
as
a
page
standing
behind
his
chair
at
dinner
this
was
an
honour
no
notion
of
degradation
was
in
it
it
was
a
necessary
step
to
higher
honour
and
what
was
the
next
higher
honour
to
be
set
free
from
service
no
to
serve
in
the
harder
service
of
the
field
to
be
a
squire
to
some
noble
knight
to
tend
his
horse
to
clean
his
armour
to
see
that
every
rivet
was
sound
every
buckle
true
every
strap
strong
to
ride
behind
him
and
carry
his
spear
and
if
more
than
one
attacked
him
to
rush
to
his
aid
this
service
was
the
more
honourable
because
it
was
harder
and
was
the
next
step
to
higher
honour
yet
and
what
was
this
higher
honour
that
of
knighthood
wherein
did
this
knighthood
consist
the
very
word
means
simply
and
for
what
was
the
knight
thus
waited
upon
by
his
squire
that
he
might
be
free
to
do
as
he
pleased
no
but
that
he
might
be
free
to
be
the
servant
of
all
by
being
a
squire
first
the
servant
of
one
he
learned
to
rise
to
the
higher
rank
that
of
servant
of
all
his
horse
was
tended
this
armour
observed
his
sword
and
spear
and
shield
held
to
his
hand
that
he
might
have
no
trouble
looking
after
himself
but
might
be
free
strong
unwearied
to
shoot
like
an
arrow
to
the
rescue
of
any
and
every
one
who
needed
his
ready
aid
there
was
a
grand
heart
of
christianity
in
that
old
chivalry
notwithstanding
all
its
abuses
which
must
be
no
more
laid
to
its
charge
than
the
burning
of
jews
and
heretics
to
christianity
it
was
the
lack
of
it
not
the
presence
of
it
that
occasioned
the
abuses
that
coexisted
with
it
train
our
theodora
as
a
holy
and
there
will
be
no
need
to
restrain
any
impulse
of
wise
affection
from
pouring
itself
forth
upon
her
my
firm
belief
is
that
we
should
then
love
and
honour
her
far
more
than
if
we
made
her
just
like
one
of
our
but
what
if
she
should
turn
out
utterly
unfit
for
it
ah
then
would
come
an
obstacle
but
it
will
not
come
till
that
discovery
is
but
if
we
should
be
going
wrong
all
the
time
now
there
comes
the
kind
of
care
that
never
troubles
me
and
which
i
so
strongly
object
to
it
won
t
hurt
her
anyhow
and
we
ought
always
to
act
upon
the
ideal
it
is
the
only
safe
ground
of
action
when
that
which
contradicts
and
resists
and
would
ruin
our
ideal
opposes
us
then
we
must
take
measures
but
not
till
then
can
we
take
measures
or
know
what
measures
it
may
be
necessary
to
take
but
the
ideal
itself
is
the
only
thing
worth
striving
after
remember
what
our
lord
himself
said
be
ye
therefore
perfect
even
as
your
father
which
is
in
heaven
is
well
i
will
think
about
it
harry
there
is
time
plenty
no
time
only
not
to
think
about
it
the
more
you
think
about
it
the
better
if
a
thing
be
a
good
thing
the
more
you
think
about
it
the
better
it
will
look
for
its
real
nature
will
go
on
coming
out
and
showing
itself
i
can
not
doubt
that
you
will
soon
see
how
good
it
we
then
went
home
it
was
only
two
days
after
that
my
wife
said
to
me
i
am
more
than
reconciled
to
your
plan
husband
it
seems
to
me
when
we
reentered
connie
s
room
we
found
that
her
baby
had
just
waked
and
she
had
managed
to
get
one
arm
under
her
and
was
trying
to
comfort
her
for
she
was
crying
chapter
ix
a
spring
chapter
more
especially
now
in
my
old
age
i
find
myself
to
a
lingering
motion
i
would
if
i
might
tell
a
tale
day
by
day
hour
by
hour
following
the
movement
of
the
year
in
its
sweet
change
of
seasons
this
may
not
be
but
i
will
indulge
myself
now
so
far
as
to
call
this
a
spring
chapter
and
so
pass
to
the
summer
when
my
reader
will
see
why
i
have
called
my
story
the
seaboard
i
was
out
one
day
amongst
my
people
and
i
found
two
precious
things
one
a
lovely
little
fact
the
other
a
lovely
little
primrose
this
was
a
pinched
dwarfish
thing
for
the
spring
was
but
a
baby
herself
and
so
could
not
mother
more
than
a
weakling
the
frost
lay
all
about
it
under
the
hedge
but
its
rough
leaves
kept
it
just
warm
enough
and
hardly
now
i
should
never
have
pulled
the
little
darling
it
would
have
seemed
a
kind
of
small
sacrilege
committed
on
the
church
of
nature
seeing
she
had
but
this
one
only
with
my
sickly
cub
at
home
i
felt
justified
in
ravening
like
a
beast
of
prey
i
even
went
so
far
in
my
greed
as
to
dig
up
the
little
plant
with
my
fingers
and
bear
it
leaves
and
all
with
a
lump
of
earth
about
it
to
keep
it
alive
home
to
my
little
woman
a
present
from
the
outside
world
which
she
loved
so
much
and
as
i
went
there
dawned
upon
me
the
recollection
of
a
little
mirror
in
which
if
i
could
find
it
she
would
see
it
still
more
lovely
than
in
a
direct
looking
at
itself
so
i
set
myself
to
find
it
for
it
lay
in
fragments
in
the
drawers
and
cabinets
of
my
memory
and
before
i
got
home
i
had
found
all
the
pieces
and
put
them
together
and
then
it
was
a
lovely
little
sonnet
which
a
friend
of
mine
had
written
and
allowed
me
to
see
many
years
before
i
was
in
the
way
of
writing
verses
myself
but
i
should
have
been
proud
to
have
written
this
one
i
never
could
have
done
that
yet
as
far
as
i
knew
it
had
never
seen
the
light
through
the
windows
of
print
it
was
with
some
difficulty
that
i
got
it
all
right
but
i
thought
i
had
succeeded
very
nearly
if
not
absolutely
and
i
said
it
over
and
over
till
i
was
sure
i
should
not
spoil
its
music
or
its
meaning
by
halting
in
the
delivery
of
it
look
here
my
connie
what
i
have
brought
you
i
said
she
held
out
her
two
white
hands
took
it
as
if
it
had
been
a
human
baby
and
looked
at
it
lovingly
till
the
tears
came
in
her
eyes
she
would
have
made
a
tender
picture
as
she
then
lay
with
her
two
hands
up
holding
the
little
beauty
before
her
eyes
then
i
said
what
i
have
already
written
about
the
mirror
and
repeated
the
sonnet
to
her
here
it
is
and
my
readers
will
owe
me
gratitude
for
it
my
friend
had
found
the
snowdrop
in
february
and
in
frost
indeed
he
told
me
that
there
was
a
tolerable
sprinkling
of
snow
upon
the
ground
i
know
not
what
among
the
grass
thou
art
thy
nature
nor
thy
substance
fairest
flower
nor
what
to
other
eyes
thou
hast
of
power
to
send
thine
image
through
them
to
the
heart
but
when
i
push
the
frosty
leaves
apart
and
see
thee
hiding
in
thy
wintry
bower
thou
growest
up
within
me
from
that
hour
and
through
the
snow
i
with
the
spring
depart
i
have
no
words
but
fragrant
is
the
breath
pale
beauty
of
thy
second
life
within
there
is
a
wind
that
cometh
for
thy
death
but
thou
a
life
immortal
dost
begin
where
in
one
soul
which
is
thy
heaven
shall
dwell
thy
spirit
beautiful
unspeakable
will
you
say
it
again
papa
said
connie
i
do
not
quite
understand
i
will
my
dear
but
i
will
do
something
better
as
well
i
will
go
and
write
it
out
for
you
as
soon
as
i
have
given
you
something
else
that
i
have
thank
you
papa
and
please
write
it
in
your
best
sunday
hand
that
i
may
read
it
quite
i
promised
and
repeated
the
poem
i
understand
it
a
little
better
she
said
but
the
meaning
is
just
like
the
primrose
itself
hidden
up
in
its
green
leaves
when
you
give
it
me
in
writing
i
will
push
them
apart
and
find
it
now
tell
me
what
else
you
have
brought
i
was
greatly
pleased
with
the
resemblance
the
child
saw
between
the
plant
and
the
sonnet
but
i
did
not
say
anything
in
praise
i
only
expressed
satisfaction
before
i
began
my
story
wynnie
came
in
and
sat
down
with
us
i
have
been
to
see
miss
aylmer
this
morning
i
said
she
feels
the
loss
of
her
mother
very
much
poor
how
old
was
she
papa
asked
connie
she
was
over
ninety
my
dear
but
she
had
forgotten
how
much
herself
and
her
daughter
could
not
be
sure
about
it
she
was
a
peculiar
old
lady
you
know
she
once
reproved
me
for
inadvertently
putting
my
hat
on
the
tablecloth
mr
shafton
she
said
was
one
of
the
old
school
he
would
never
have
done
that
i
don
t
know
what
the
world
is
coming
my
two
girls
laughed
at
the
idea
of
their
papa
being
reproved
for
bad
manners
what
did
you
say
papa
they
asked
i
begged
her
pardon
and
lifted
it
instantly
o
it
s
all
right
now
my
dear
she
said
when
you
ve
taken
it
up
again
but
i
like
good
manners
though
i
live
in
a
cottage
had
she
seen
better
days
then
asked
wynnie
she
was
a
farmer
s
daughter
and
a
farmer
s
widow
i
suppose
the
chief
difference
in
her
mode
of
life
was
that
she
lived
in
a
cottage
instead
of
a
but
what
is
the
story
you
have
to
tell
us
i
m
coming
to
that
when
you
have
done
with
your
we
have
done
after
talking
awhile
during
which
she
went
bustling
a
little
about
the
cottage
in
order
to
hide
her
feelings
as
i
thought
for
she
has
a
good
deal
of
her
mother
s
sense
of
dignity
about
her
but
i
want
your
mother
to
hear
the
story
run
and
fetch
her
o
do
make
haste
wynnie
said
connie
when
ethelwyn
came
i
went
on
miss
aylmer
was
bustling
a
little
about
the
cottage
putting
things
to
rights
all
at
once
she
gave
a
cry
of
surprise
and
said
here
it
is
at
last
she
had
taken
up
a
stuff
dress
of
her
mother
s
and
was
holding
it
in
one
hand
while
with
the
other
she
drew
from
the
pocket
what
do
you
think
various
guesses
were
hazarded
no
no
nothing
like
it
i
know
you
never
guess
therefore
it
would
not
be
fair
to
keep
you
trying
a
great
iron
horseshoe
the
old
woman
of
ninety
years
had
in
the
pocket
of
the
dress
that
she
was
wearing
at
the
very
moment
when
she
died
for
her
death
was
sudden
an
iron
what
did
it
mean
could
her
daughter
explain
it
that
she
proceeded
at
once
to
do
do
you
remember
sir
she
said
how
that
horseshoe
used
to
hang
on
a
nail
over
the
chimneypiece
i
do
remember
having
observed
it
there
i
answered
for
once
when
i
took
notice
of
it
i
said
to
your
mother
laughing
i
hope
you
are
not
afraid
of
witches
aylmer
and
she
looked
a
little
offended
and
assured
me
to
the
well
her
daughter
went
on
about
three
months
ago
i
missed
it
my
mother
would
not
tell
me
anything
about
it
and
here
it
is
i
can
hardly
think
she
can
have
carried
it
about
all
that
time
without
me
finding
it
out
but
i
don
t
know
here
it
is
anyhow
perhaps
when
she
felt
death
drawing
nearer
she
took
it
from
somewhere
where
she
had
hidden
it
and
put
it
in
her
pocket
if
i
had
found
it
in
time
i
would
have
put
it
in
her
but
why
i
asked
do
tell
me
the
story
about
it
if
you
know
i
know
it
quite
well
for
she
told
me
all
about
it
once
it
is
the
shoe
of
a
favourite
mare
of
my
father
s
one
he
used
to
ride
when
he
went
courting
my
mother
my
grandfather
did
not
like
to
have
a
young
man
coming
about
the
house
and
so
he
came
after
the
old
folks
were
gone
to
bed
but
he
had
a
long
way
to
come
and
he
rode
that
mare
she
had
to
go
over
some
stones
to
get
to
the
stable
and
my
mother
used
to
spread
straw
there
for
it
was
under
the
window
of
my
grandfather
s
room
that
her
shoes
mightn
t
make
a
noise
and
wake
him
and
that
s
one
of
the
shoes
she
said
holding
it
up
to
me
when
the
mare
died
my
mother
begged
my
father
for
the
one
off
her
near
forefoot
where
she
had
so
often
stood
and
patted
her
neck
when
my
father
was
mounted
to
ride
home
but
it
was
very
naughty
of
her
wasn
t
it
said
wynnie
to
do
that
without
her
father
s
knowledge
i
don
t
say
it
was
right
my
dear
but
in
looking
at
what
is
wrong
we
ought
to
look
for
the
beginning
of
the
wrong
and
possibly
we
might
find
that
in
this
case
farther
back
if
for
instance
a
father
isn
t
a
father
we
must
not
be
too
hard
in
blaming
the
child
for
not
being
a
child
the
father
s
part
has
to
come
first
and
teach
the
child
s
part
now
if
i
might
guess
from
what
i
know
of
the
old
lady
in
whom
probably
it
was
much
softened
her
father
was
very
possibly
a
hard
unreasoning
and
unreasonable
man
such
that
it
scarcely
ever
came
into
the
daughter
s
head
that
she
had
anything
else
to
do
with
regard
to
him
than
beware
of
the
consequences
of
letting
him
know
that
she
had
a
lover
the
whole
thing
i
allow
was
wrong
but
i
suspect
the
father
was
first
to
blame
and
far
more
to
blame
than
the
daughter
and
that
is
the
more
likely
from
the
high
character
of
the
old
dame
and
the
romantic
way
in
which
she
clung
to
the
memory
of
the
courtship
a
true
heart
only
does
not
grow
old
and
i
have
therefore
no
doubt
that
the
marriage
was
a
happy
one
besides
i
daresay
it
was
very
much
the
custom
of
the
country
where
they
were
and
that
makes
some
well
i
m
sure
papa
you
wouldn
t
like
any
of
us
to
go
and
do
like
that
said
wynnie
assuredly
not
my
dear
i
answered
laughing
nor
have
i
any
fear
of
it
but
shall
i
tell
you
what
i
think
would
be
one
of
the
chief
things
to
trouble
me
if
you
did
if
you
like
papa
but
it
sounds
rather
dreadful
to
hear
such
an
said
wynnie
it
would
be
to
think
how
much
i
had
failed
of
being
such
a
father
to
you
as
i
ought
to
be
and
as
i
wished
to
be
if
it
should
prove
at
all
possible
for
you
to
do
such
a
it
s
too
dreadful
to
talk
about
papa
said
wynnie
and
the
subject
was
dropped
she
was
a
strange
child
this
wynnie
of
ours
whereas
most
people
are
in
danger
of
thinking
themselves
in
the
right
or
insisting
that
they
are
whether
they
think
so
or
not
she
was
always
thinking
herself
in
the
wrong
nay
more
she
always
expected
to
find
herself
in
the
wrong
if
the
perpetrator
of
any
mischief
was
inquired
after
she
always
looked
into
her
own
bosom
to
see
whether
she
could
not
with
justice
aver
that
she
was
the
doer
of
the
deed
i
believe
she
felt
at
that
moment
as
if
she
had
been
deceiving
me
already
and
deserved
to
be
driven
out
of
the
house
this
came
of
an
accompanied
by
a
general
dissatisfaction
with
herself
which
was
not
upheld
by
a
sufficient
faith
in
the
divine
sympathy
or
sufficient
confidence
of
final
purification
she
never
spared
herself
and
if
she
was
a
little
severe
on
the
younger
ones
sometimes
no
one
was
yet
more
indulgent
to
them
she
would
eat
all
their
hard
crusts
for
them
always
give
them
the
best
and
take
the
worst
for
herself
if
there
was
any
part
in
the
dish
that
she
was
helping
that
she
thought
nobody
would
like
she
invariably
assigned
it
to
her
own
share
it
looked
like
a
determined
sometimes
but
that
was
not
it
she
did
not
care
for
her
own
comfort
enough
to
feel
it
any
mortification
though
i
observed
that
when
her
mother
or
i
helped
her
to
anything
nice
she
ate
it
with
as
much
relish
as
the
youngest
of
the
party
and
her
sweet
smile
was
always
ready
to
meet
the
least
kindness
that
was
offered
her
her
obedience
was
perfect
and
had
been
so
for
very
many
years
as
far
as
we
could
see
indeed
not
since
she
was
the
merest
child
had
there
been
any
contest
between
us
now
of
course
there
was
no
demand
of
obedience
she
was
simply
the
best
earthly
friend
that
her
father
and
mother
had
it
often
caused
me
some
passing
anxiety
to
think
that
her
temperament
as
well
as
her
devotion
to
her
home
might
cause
her
great
suffering
some
day
but
when
those
thoughts
came
i
just
gave
her
to
god
to
take
care
of
her
mother
sometimes
said
to
her
that
she
would
make
an
excellent
wife
for
a
poor
man
she
would
brighten
up
greatly
at
this
taking
it
for
a
compliment
of
the
best
sort
and
she
did
not
forget
it
as
the
sequel
will
show
she
would
choose
to
sit
with
one
candle
lit
when
there
were
two
on
the
table
wasting
her
eyes
to
save
the
candles
which
will
you
have
for
dinner
papa
roast
beef
or
boiled
she
asked
me
once
when
her
mother
was
too
unwell
to
attend
to
the
housekeeping
and
when
i
replied
that
i
would
have
whichever
she
liked
best
the
boiled
beef
lasts
longest
i
think
she
said
yet
she
was
not
only
as
liberal
and
kind
as
any
to
the
poor
but
she
was
which
is
rarer
and
perhaps
more
important
for
the
final
formation
of
a
character
carefully
just
to
everyone
with
whom
she
had
any
dealings
her
sense
of
law
was
very
strong
law
with
her
was
something
absolute
and
not
to
be
questioned
in
her
childhood
there
was
one
lady
to
whom
for
years
she
showed
a
decided
aversion
and
we
could
not
understand
it
for
it
was
the
most
inoffensive
miss
boulderstone
when
she
was
nearly
grown
up
one
of
us
happening
to
allude
to
the
fact
she
volunteered
an
explanation
miss
boulderstone
had
happened
to
call
one
day
when
wynnie
then
between
three
and
four
was
in
disgrace
the
in
fact
miss
boulderstone
interceded
for
her
and
this
was
the
whole
front
of
her
offending
i
so
angry
she
said
as
if
my
papa
did
not
know
best
when
i
ought
to
come
out
of
the
corner
i
said
to
myself
and
i
couldn
t
bear
her
for
ever
so
long
after
miss
boulderstone
however
though
not
very
interesting
was
quite
a
favourite
before
she
died
she
left
wynnie
for
she
and
her
brother
were
the
last
of
their
race
a
death
watch
which
had
been
in
the
family
she
did
not
know
how
long
i
think
it
is
as
old
as
queen
elizabeth
s
time
i
took
it
to
london
to
a
skilful
man
and
had
it
as
well
repaired
as
its
age
would
admit
of
and
it
has
gone
ever
since
though
not
with
the
greatest
accuracy
for
what
could
be
expected
of
an
old
death
the
most
transitory
thing
in
creation
wynnie
wears
it
to
this
day
and
wouldn
t
part
with
it
for
the
best
watch
in
the
world
i
tell
the
reader
all
this
about
my
daughter
that
he
may
be
the
more
able
to
understand
what
will
follow
in
due
time
he
will
think
that
as
yet
my
story
has
been
nothing
but
promises
let
him
only
hope
that
i
will
fulfil
them
and
i
shall
be
content
boulderstone
did
not
long
outlive
his
sister
though
the
old
couple
for
they
were
rather
old
before
they
died
if
indeed
they
were
not
born
old
which
i
strongly
suspect
being
the
last
of
a
decaying
family
that
had
not
left
the
land
on
which
they
were
born
for
a
great
many
generations
though
the
old
people
had
not
of
what
the
french
call
sentiments
one
between
them
they
were
yet
capable
of
a
stronger
and
i
had
almost
said
more
romantic
attachment
than
many
couples
who
have
married
from
love
for
the
lady
s
sole
trouble
in
dying
was
what
her
brother
do
without
her
and
from
the
day
of
her
death
he
grew
more
and
more
dull
and
seemingly
stupid
nothing
gave
him
any
pleasure
but
having
wynnie
to
dinner
with
him
i
knew
that
it
must
be
very
dull
for
her
but
she
went
often
and
i
never
heard
her
complain
of
it
though
she
certainly
did
look
fagged
not
observe
but
fagged
showing
that
she
had
been
exerting
herself
to
meet
the
difficulties
of
the
situation
when
the
good
man
died
we
found
that
he
had
left
all
his
money
in
my
hands
in
trust
for
the
poor
of
the
parish
to
be
applied
in
any
way
i
thought
best
this
involved
me
in
much
perplexity
for
nothing
is
more
difficult
than
to
make
money
useful
to
the
poor
but
i
was
very
glad
of
it
notwithstanding
my
own
means
were
not
so
large
as
my
readers
may
think
the
property
my
wife
brought
me
was
much
encumbered
with
the
help
of
her
private
fortune
and
the
income
of
several
years
not
my
income
from
the
church
it
may
be
as
well
to
say
i
succeeded
in
clearing
off
the
encumbrances
but
even
then
there
remained
much
to
be
done
if
i
would
be
the
good
steward
that
was
not
to
be
ashamed
at
his
lord
s
coming
first
of
all
there
were
many
cottages
to
be
built
for
the
labourers
on
the
estate
if
the
farmers
would
not
or
could
not
help
i
must
do
it
for
to
provide
decent
dwellings
for
them
was
clearly
one
of
the
divine
conditions
in
the
righteous
tenure
of
property
whatever
the
human
might
be
for
it
was
not
for
myself
alone
or
for
myself
chiefly
that
this
property
was
given
to
me
it
was
for
those
who
lived
upon
it
therefore
i
laid
out
what
money
i
could
not
only
in
getting
all
the
land
clearly
in
its
right
relation
to
its
owner
but
in
doing
the
best
i
could
for
those
attached
to
it
who
could
not
help
themselves
and
when
i
hint
to
my
reader
that
i
had
some
conscience
in
paying
my
curate
though
as
they
had
no
children
they
did
not
require
so
much
as
i
should
otherwise
have
felt
compelled
to
give
them
he
will
easily
see
that
as
my
family
grew
up
i
could
not
have
so
much
to
give
away
of
my
own
as
i
should
have
liked
therefore
this
trust
of
the
good
boulderstone
was
the
more
acceptable
to
me
one
word
more
ere
i
finish
this
i
should
not
like
my
friends
to
think
that
i
had
got
tired
of
our
christmas
gatherings
because
i
have
made
no
mention
of
one
this
year
it
had
been
pretermitted
for
the
first
time
because
of
my
daughter
s
illness
it
was
much
easier
to
give
them
now
than
when
i
lived
at
the
vicarage
for
there
was
plenty
of
room
in
the
old
hall
but
my
curate
weir
still
held
a
similar
gathering
there
every
easter
another
one
word
more
about
him
some
may
wonder
why
i
have
not
mentioned
him
or
my
sister
especially
in
connection
with
connie
s
accident
the
fact
was
that
he
had
taken
or
rather
i
had
given
him
a
long
holiday
martha
had
had
several
disappointing
illnesses
and
her
general
health
had
suffered
so
much
in
consequence
that
there
was
even
some
fear
of
her
lungs
and
a
winter
in
the
south
of
france
had
been
strongly
recommended
upon
this
i
came
in
with
more
than
a
recommendation
and
insisted
that
they
should
go
they
had
started
in
the
beginning
of
october
and
had
not
returned
up
to
the
time
of
which
i
am
now
about
to
write
somewhere
in
the
beginning
of
the
month
of
april
but
my
sister
was
now
almost
quite
well
and
i
was
not
sorry
to
think
that
i
should
soon
have
a
little
more
leisure
for
such
small
literary
pursuits
as
i
delighted
in
to
my
own
enrichment
and
consequently
to
the
good
of
my
parishioners
and
friends
chapter
x
an
important
letter
it
was
then
in
the
beginning
of
april
that
i
received
one
morning
an
epistle
from
an
old
college
friend
of
mine
with
whom
i
had
renewed
my
acquaintance
of
late
through
the
pleasure
which
he
was
kind
enough
to
say
he
had
derived
from
reading
a
little
book
of
mine
upon
the
relation
of
the
mind
of
paul
to
the
gospel
story
his
name
was
shepherd
a
good
name
for
a
clergyman
in
his
case
both
christian
name
and
patronymic
might
remind
him
well
of
his
duty
david
shepherd
ought
to
be
a
good
clergyman
as
soon
as
i
had
read
the
letter
i
went
with
it
open
in
my
hand
to
find
my
wife
here
is
shepherd
i
said
with
a
clerical
and
forced
to
give
up
his
duty
for
a
whole
summer
he
writes
to
ask
me
whether
as
he
understands
i
have
a
curate
as
good
as
myself
that
is
what
the
old
fellow
says
it
might
not
suit
me
to
take
my
family
to
his
place
for
the
summer
he
assures
me
i
should
like
it
and
that
it
would
do
us
all
good
his
house
he
says
is
large
enough
to
hold
us
and
he
knows
i
should
not
like
to
be
without
duty
wherever
i
was
and
so
on
read
the
letter
for
yourself
and
turn
it
over
in
your
mind
weir
will
come
back
so
fresh
and
active
that
it
will
be
no
oppression
to
him
to
take
the
whole
of
the
duty
here
i
will
run
and
ask
turner
whether
it
would
be
safe
to
move
connie
and
whether
the
would
be
good
for
one
would
think
you
were
only
twenty
husband
you
make
up
your
mind
so
quickly
and
are
in
such
a
the
fact
was
a
vision
of
the
sea
had
rushed
in
upon
me
it
was
many
years
since
i
had
seen
the
sea
and
the
thought
of
looking
on
it
once
more
in
its
most
glorious
show
the
atlantic
itself
with
nothing
between
us
and
america
but
the
round
of
the
ridgy
water
had
excited
me
so
that
my
wife
s
reproof
if
reproof
it
was
was
quite
necessary
to
bring
me
to
my
usually
quiet
and
sober
senses
i
laughed
begged
old
grannie
s
pardon
and
set
off
to
see
turner
notwithstanding
leaving
her
to
read
and
ponder
shepherd
s
letter
what
do
you
think
turner
i
said
and
told
him
the
case
he
looked
rather
grave
when
would
you
think
of
going
he
asked
about
the
beginning
of
nearly
two
months
he
said
thoughtfully
and
miss
connie
was
not
the
worse
for
getting
on
the
sofa
yesterday
the
better
i
do
has
she
had
any
increase
of
pain
since
none
i
quite
believe
for
i
questioned
her
as
to
he
thought
again
he
was
a
careful
man
although
young
it
is
a
long
she
could
make
it
by
easy
it
would
certainly
do
her
good
to
breathe
the
and
have
such
a
thorough
change
in
every
way
if
only
it
could
be
managed
without
fatigue
and
suffering
i
think
if
you
can
get
her
up
every
day
between
this
and
that
we
shall
be
justified
in
trying
it
at
least
the
sooner
you
get
her
out
of
doors
the
better
too
but
the
weather
is
scarcely
fit
for
that
a
good
deal
will
depend
on
how
she
is
inclined
i
yes
but
in
her
case
you
must
not
mind
that
too
much
an
invalid
s
instincts
as
to
eating
and
drinking
are
more
to
be
depended
upon
than
those
of
a
healthy
person
but
it
is
not
so
i
think
with
regard
to
anything
involving
effort
that
she
must
sometimes
be
urged
to
she
must
not
judge
that
by
inclination
i
have
had
in
my
short
practice
two
patients
who
considered
themselves
as
you
will
find
the
common
people
in
the
part
you
are
going
to
call
them
bedridden
that
is
one
of
them
i
persuaded
to
make
the
attempt
to
rise
and
although
her
sense
of
inability
was
anything
but
feigned
and
she
will
be
a
sufferer
to
the
end
of
her
days
yet
she
goes
about
the
house
without
much
inconvenience
and
i
suspect
is
not
only
physically
but
morally
the
better
for
it
the
other
would
not
consent
to
try
and
i
believe
lies
there
the
will
has
more
to
do
with
most
things
than
people
generally
suppose
i
said
could
you
manage
now
do
you
think
supposing
we
resolve
to
make
the
experiment
to
accompany
us
the
first
stage
or
two
it
is
very
likely
i
could
only
you
must
not
depend
upon
me
i
can
not
tell
beforehand
you
yourself
would
teach
me
that
i
must
not
be
a
respecter
of
persons
you
i
returned
to
my
wife
she
was
in
connie
s
room
well
my
dear
i
said
what
do
you
think
of
it
of
what
she
asked
why
of
shepherd
s
letter
of
course
i
answered
i
ve
been
ordering
the
dinner
since
the
dinner
i
returned
with
some
show
of
contempt
for
i
knew
my
wife
was
only
teasing
me
what
s
the
dinner
to
the
atlantic
what
do
you
mean
by
the
atlantic
papa
said
connie
from
whose
roguish
eyes
i
could
see
that
her
mother
had
told
her
all
about
it
and
that
was
not
disinclined
to
get
up
if
only
she
could
the
atlantic
my
dear
is
the
name
given
to
that
portion
of
the
waters
of
the
globe
which
divides
europe
from
america
i
will
fetch
you
the
universal
gazetteer
if
you
would
like
to
consult
it
on
the
o
papa
laughed
connie
you
know
what
i
yes
and
you
know
what
i
mean
too
you
squirrel
but
do
you
really
mean
papa
she
said
that
you
will
take
me
to
the
atlantic
if
you
will
only
oblige
me
by
getting
well
enough
to
go
as
soon
as
the
poor
child
half
rose
on
her
elbow
but
sank
back
again
with
a
moan
which
i
took
for
a
cry
of
pain
i
was
beside
her
in
a
moment
my
darling
you
have
hurt
yourself
o
no
papa
i
felt
for
the
moment
as
if
i
could
get
up
if
i
liked
but
i
soon
found
that
i
hadn
t
any
back
or
legs
o
what
a
plague
i
am
to
you
on
the
contrary
you
are
the
nicest
plaything
in
the
world
connie
one
always
knows
where
to
find
she
half
laughed
and
half
cried
and
the
two
halves
made
a
very
bewitching
whole
but
i
went
on
i
mean
to
try
whether
my
dolly
won
t
bear
moving
one
thing
is
clear
i
can
t
go
without
it
do
you
think
you
could
be
got
on
the
sofa
without
hurting
you
i
am
sure
i
could
papa
i
feel
better
today
than
i
have
felt
yet
mamma
do
send
for
susan
and
get
me
up
before
when
i
went
in
after
a
couple
of
hours
or
so
i
found
her
lying
on
the
conch
propped
up
with
pillows
she
lay
looking
out
of
the
window
on
the
lawn
at
the
back
of
the
house
a
smile
hovered
about
her
bloodless
lips
and
the
blue
of
her
eyes
though
very
gray
looked
sunny
her
white
face
showed
the
whiter
because
her
dark
brown
hair
was
all
about
it
we
had
had
to
cut
her
hair
but
it
had
grown
to
her
neck
again
i
have
been
trying
to
count
the
daisies
on
the
lawn
she
said
what
a
sharp
sight
you
must
have
child
i
see
them
all
as
clear
as
if
they
were
enamelled
on
that
table
before
i
was
not
so
anxious
to
get
rid
of
the
daisies
as
some
people
are
neither
did
i
keep
the
grass
quite
so
close
shaved
but
she
went
on
i
could
not
count
them
for
it
gave
me
the
fidgets
in
my
you
don
t
say
so
i
exclaimed
she
looked
at
me
with
some
surprise
but
concluding
that
i
was
only
making
a
little
of
my
mild
fun
at
her
expense
she
laughed
yes
isn
t
it
a
wonderful
fact
she
said
it
is
a
fact
my
dear
that
i
feel
ready
to
go
on
my
knees
and
thank
god
for
i
may
be
wrong
but
i
take
it
as
a
sign
that
you
are
beginning
to
recover
a
little
but
we
mustn
t
make
too
much
of
it
lest
i
should
be
mistaken
i
added
checking
myself
for
i
feared
exciting
her
too
much
but
she
lay
very
still
only
the
tears
rose
slowly
and
lay
shimmering
in
her
eyes
after
about
five
minutes
during
which
we
were
both
silent
o
papa
she
said
to
think
of
ever
walking
out
with
you
again
and
feeling
the
wind
on
my
face
i
can
hardly
believe
it
it
is
so
mild
i
think
you
might
have
half
that
pleasure
at
once
i
and
i
opened
the
window
let
the
spring
air
gently
move
her
hair
for
one
moment
and
then
shut
it
again
connie
breathed
deep
and
said
after
a
little
pause
i
had
no
idea
how
delightful
it
was
to
think
that
i
have
been
in
the
way
of
breathing
that
every
moment
for
so
many
years
and
never
thought
about
it
it
is
not
always
just
like
that
in
this
climate
but
i
ought
not
to
have
made
that
remark
when
i
wanted
to
make
this
other
that
i
suspect
we
shall
find
some
day
that
the
loss
of
the
human
paradise
consists
chiefly
in
the
closing
of
the
human
eyes
that
at
least
far
more
of
it
than
people
think
remains
about
us
still
only
we
are
so
filled
with
foolish
desires
and
evil
cares
that
we
can
not
see
or
hear
can
not
even
smell
or
taste
the
pleasant
things
round
about
us
we
have
need
to
pray
in
regard
to
the
right
receiving
of
the
things
of
the
senses
even
lord
open
thou
our
hearts
to
understand
thy
word
for
each
of
these
things
is
as
certainly
a
word
of
god
as
jesus
is
the
word
of
god
he
has
made
nothing
in
vain
all
is
for
our
teaching
shall
i
tell
you
what
such
a
breath
of
fresh
air
makes
me
think
of
it
comes
to
me
said
connie
like
forgiveness
when
i
was
a
little
girl
and
was
naughty
i
used
to
feel
just
like
it
is
the
same
kind
of
thing
i
feel
i
said
as
if
life
from
the
spirit
of
god
were
coming
into
my
soul
i
think
of
the
wind
that
bloweth
where
it
listeth
wind
and
spirit
are
the
same
word
in
the
greek
and
the
latin
word
comes
even
nearer
to
what
we
are
saying
for
it
is
the
wind
as
and
now
connie
i
will
tell
you
and
you
will
see
how
i
am
growing
able
to
talk
to
you
like
quite
an
old
friend
what
put
me
in
such
a
delight
with
shepherd
s
letter
and
so
exposed
me
to
be
teased
by
mamma
and
you
as
i
read
it
there
rose
up
before
me
a
vision
of
one
sight
of
the
sea
which
i
had
when
i
was
a
young
man
long
before
i
saw
your
mamma
i
had
gone
out
for
a
walk
along
some
high
downs
but
i
ought
to
tell
you
that
i
had
been
working
rather
hard
at
cambridge
and
the
life
seemed
to
be
all
gone
out
of
me
though
my
holidays
had
come
they
did
not
feel
quite
like
holidays
not
as
holidays
used
to
feel
when
i
was
a
boy
even
when
walking
along
those
downs
with
the
scents
of
sixteen
grasses
or
so
in
my
brain
like
a
melody
with
the
odour
of
the
earth
for
the
accompaniment
upon
which
it
floated
and
with
just
enough
of
wind
to
stir
them
up
and
set
them
in
motion
i
could
not
feel
at
all
i
remembered
something
of
what
i
had
used
to
feel
in
such
places
but
instead
of
believing
in
that
i
doubted
now
whether
it
had
not
been
all
a
trick
that
i
played
myself
a
fancied
pleasure
only
i
was
walking
along
then
with
the
sea
behind
me
it
was
a
warm
cloudy
day
i
had
had
no
sunshine
since
i
came
out
all
at
once
i
turned
i
don
t
know
why
there
lay
the
gray
sea
but
not
as
i
had
seen
it
last
not
all
gray
it
was
dotted
spotted
and
splashed
all
over
with
drops
pools
and
lakes
of
light
of
all
shades
of
depth
from
a
light
shimmer
of
tremulous
gray
through
a
half
light
that
turned
the
prevailing
lead
colour
into
translucent
green
that
seemed
to
grow
out
of
its
depths
through
this
i
say
to
brilliant
light
deepening
and
deepening
till
my
very
soul
was
stung
by
the
triumph
of
the
intensity
of
its
molten
silver
there
was
no
sun
upon
me
but
there
were
breaks
in
the
clouds
over
the
sea
through
which
the
air
being
filled
with
vapour
i
could
see
the
long
lines
of
the
descending
on
the
waters
like
rain
so
like
a
rain
of
light
that
the
water
seemed
to
plash
up
in
light
under
their
fall
i
questioned
the
past
no
more
the
present
seized
upon
me
and
i
knew
that
the
past
was
true
and
that
nature
was
more
lovely
more
awful
in
her
loveliness
than
i
could
grasp
it
was
a
lonely
place
i
fell
on
my
knees
and
worshipped
the
god
that
made
the
glory
and
my
while
i
spoke
connie
s
tears
had
been
flowing
quietly
and
mamma
and
i
were
making
fun
while
you
were
seeing
such
things
as
those
she
said
pitifully
you
didn
t
hurt
them
one
bit
my
darling
neither
mamma
nor
you
if
i
had
been
the
least
cross
about
it
as
i
should
have
been
when
i
was
as
young
as
at
the
time
of
which
i
was
thinking
that
would
have
ruined
the
vision
entirely
but
your
merriment
only
made
me
enjoy
it
more
and
my
connie
i
hope
you
will
see
the
atlantic
before
long
and
if
one
vision
should
come
as
brilliant
as
that
we
shall
be
fortunate
indeed
if
we
went
all
the
way
to
the
west
to
see
that
o
papa
i
dare
hardly
think
of
it
it
is
too
delightful
but
do
you
think
we
shall
really
go
i
do
here
comes
your
mamma
i
am
going
to
say
to
shepherd
my
dear
that
i
will
take
his
parish
in
hand
and
if
i
can
not
after
all
go
myself
will
find
some
one
so
that
he
need
be
in
no
anxiety
from
the
uncertainty
which
must
hang
over
our
movements
even
till
the
experiment
itself
is
very
well
husband
i
am
quite
and
as
i
watched
connie
i
saw
that
hope
and
expectation
did
much
to
prepare
her
chapter
xi
connie
s
dream
turner
being
a
good
mechanic
as
well
as
surgeon
proceeded
to
invent
and
with
his
own
hands
in
a
great
measure
construct
a
kind
of
litter
which
with
a
laid
upon
it
could
be
placed
in
our
own
carriage
for
connie
to
lie
upon
and
from
that
lifted
without
disturbing
her
and
placed
in
a
similar
manner
in
the
railway
carriage
he
had
laid
connie
repeatedly
upon
it
before
he
was
satisfied
that
the
arrangement
of
the
springs
was
successful
but
at
length
she
declared
that
it
was
perfect
and
that
she
would
not
mind
being
carried
across
the
arabian
desert
on
a
camel
s
back
with
that
under
her
as
the
season
advanced
she
continued
to
improve
i
shall
never
forget
the
first
time
she
was
carried
out
upon
the
lawn
if
you
can
imagine
an
infant
coming
into
the
world
capable
of
the
observation
and
delight
of
a
child
of
eight
or
ten
you
will
have
some
idea
of
how
connie
received
the
new
impressions
of
everything
around
her
they
were
almost
too
much
for
her
at
first
however
she
who
had
been
used
to
scamper
about
like
a
wild
thing
on
a
pony
found
the
delight
of
a
breath
of
wind
almost
more
than
she
could
bear
after
she
was
laid
down
she
closed
her
eyes
and
the
smile
that
flickered
about
her
mouth
was
of
a
sort
that
harmonised
entirely
with
the
two
great
tears
that
crept
softly
out
from
under
her
eyelids
and
sank
rather
than
ran
down
her
cheeks
she
lay
so
that
she
faced
a
rich
tract
of
gently
receding
upland
plentifully
wooded
to
the
horizon
s
edge
and
through
the
wood
peeped
the
white
and
red
houses
of
a
little
hamlet
with
the
square
tower
of
its
church
just
rising
above
the
trees
a
kind
of
frame
was
made
to
the
whole
picture
by
the
nearer
trees
of
our
own
woods
through
an
opening
in
which
evidently
made
or
left
for
its
sake
the
distant
prospect
was
visible
it
was
a
morning
in
early
summer
when
the
leaves
were
not
quite
but
almost
and
their
green
was
shining
and
pure
as
the
blue
of
the
sky
when
the
air
had
no
touch
of
bitterness
or
of
lassitude
but
was
thoroughly
warm
and
yet
filled
the
lungs
with
the
reviving
as
of
a
draught
of
cold
water
we
had
fastened
the
carriage
umbrella
to
the
sofa
so
that
it
should
shade
her
perfectly
without
obscuring
her
prospect
and
behind
this
we
all
crept
leaving
her
to
come
to
herself
without
being
looked
at
for
emotion
is
a
shy
and
sacred
thing
and
should
be
tenderly
hidden
by
those
who
are
near
the
bees
kept
very
all
about
us
to
see
one
huge
fellow
as
big
as
three
ordinary
ones
with
pieces
of
red
and
yellow
about
him
as
if
he
were
the
beadle
of
all
and
overgrown
in
consequence
to
see
him
i
say
down
in
a
little
tuft
of
white
clover
rolling
about
in
it
hardly
able
to
move
for
fatness
yet
bumming
away
as
if
his
business
was
to
express
the
delight
of
the
whole
creation
was
a
sight
then
there
were
the
butterflies
so
light
that
they
seemed
to
tumble
up
into
the
air
and
get
down
again
with
difficulty
they
bewildered
me
with
their
inscrutable
variations
of
purpose
if
i
could
but
see
once
for
an
hour
into
the
mind
of
a
butterfly
i
thought
it
would
be
to
me
worth
all
the
natural
history
i
ever
read
if
i
could
but
see
why
he
changes
his
mind
so
often
and
so
suddenly
what
he
saw
about
that
flower
to
make
him
seek
it
then
why
on
a
nearer
approach
he
should
decline
further
acquaintance
with
it
and
go
rocking
away
through
the
air
to
do
the
same
fifty
times
over
again
it
would
give
me
an
insight
into
all
animal
and
vegetable
life
that
ages
of
study
could
not
bring
me
up
i
was
thinking
all
this
behind
my
daughter
s
umbrella
while
a
lark
whose
body
had
melted
quite
away
in
the
heavenly
spaces
was
scattering
bright
beads
of
ringing
melody
straight
down
upon
our
heads
while
a
cock
was
crowing
like
a
clarion
from
the
as
if
in
defiance
of
the
golden
glitter
of
his
silent
brother
on
the
roof
of
the
stable
while
a
little
stream
that
scampered
down
the
same
slope
as
the
lawn
lay
upon
from
a
well
in
the
mingled
its
sweet
undertone
of
contentment
with
the
jubilation
of
the
lark
and
the
hum
of
the
bees
and
while
white
clouds
floated
in
the
majesty
of
silence
across
the
blue
deeps
of
the
heavens
the
air
was
so
full
of
life
and
reviving
that
it
seemed
like
the
crude
substance
that
god
might
take
to
make
babies
souls
of
only
the
very
simile
smells
of
materialism
and
therefore
i
do
not
like
it
papa
said
connie
at
length
and
i
was
beside
her
in
a
moment
her
face
looked
almost
glorified
with
delight
there
was
a
hush
of
that
awe
upon
it
which
is
perhaps
one
of
the
deepest
kinds
of
delight
she
put
out
her
thin
white
hand
took
hold
of
a
button
of
my
coat
drew
me
down
towards
her
and
said
in
a
whisper
don
t
you
think
god
is
here
papa
yes
i
do
my
darling
i
answered
doesn
t
enjoy
this
yes
my
dear
he
wouldn
t
make
us
enjoy
it
if
he
did
not
enjoy
it
it
would
be
to
deceive
us
to
make
us
glad
and
blessed
while
our
father
did
not
care
about
it
or
how
it
came
to
us
at
least
it
would
amount
to
making
us
no
longer
his
i
am
so
glad
you
think
so
i
do
and
i
shall
enjoy
it
so
much
more
she
could
hardly
finish
her
sentence
but
burst
out
sobbing
so
that
i
was
afraid
she
would
hurt
herself
i
saw
however
that
it
was
best
to
leave
her
to
quiet
herself
and
motioned
to
the
rest
to
keep
back
and
let
her
recover
as
she
could
the
emotion
passed
off
in
a
summer
shower
and
when
i
went
round
once
more
her
face
was
shining
just
like
a
wet
landscape
after
the
sun
has
come
out
and
nature
has
begun
to
make
gentle
game
of
her
own
past
sorrows
in
a
little
while
she
was
merry
merrier
notwithstanding
her
weakness
than
i
think
i
had
ever
seen
her
before
look
at
that
comical
sparrow
she
said
look
how
he
cocks
his
head
first
on
one
side
and
then
on
the
other
does
he
want
us
to
see
him
is
he
bumptious
or
what
i
hardly
know
my
dear
i
think
sparrows
are
very
like
schoolboys
and
i
suspect
that
if
we
understood
the
one
class
thoroughly
we
should
understand
the
other
but
i
confess
i
do
not
yet
understand
perhaps
you
will
when
charlie
and
harry
are
old
enough
to
go
to
school
said
connie
it
is
my
only
chance
of
making
any
true
acquaintance
with
the
sparrows
i
answered
look
at
them
now
i
exclaimed
as
a
little
crowd
of
them
suddenly
appeared
where
only
one
had
stood
a
moment
before
and
exploded
in
objurgation
and
general
unintelligible
excitement
after
some
obscure
fluttering
of
wings
and
pecking
they
all
vanished
except
two
which
walked
about
in
a
dignified
manner
trying
apparently
to
seem
quite
unconscious
each
of
the
other
s
presence
i
think
it
was
a
political
meeting
of
some
sort
said
connie
laughing
merrily
well
they
have
this
advantage
over
us
i
answered
that
they
get
through
their
business
whatever
it
may
be
with
considerably
greater
expedition
than
we
get
through
a
short
silence
followed
during
which
connie
lay
contemplating
everything
what
do
you
think
we
girls
are
like
then
papa
she
asked
at
length
don
t
say
you
don
t
know
i
ought
to
know
something
more
about
you
than
i
do
about
schoolboys
and
i
think
i
do
know
a
little
about
girls
not
much
though
they
puzzle
me
a
good
deal
sometimes
i
know
what
a
woman
is
you
can
t
help
doing
that
papa
interrupted
connie
adding
with
her
old
roguishness
you
mustn
t
pass
yourself
off
for
very
knowing
for
that
by
the
time
wynnie
is
quite
grown
up
your
skill
will
be
i
hope
i
shall
understand
her
then
and
you
too
a
shadow
just
like
the
shadow
of
one
of
those
white
clouds
above
us
passed
over
her
face
and
she
said
trying
to
smile
i
shall
never
grow
up
papa
if
i
live
i
shall
only
be
a
girl
at
best
a
creature
you
can
t
on
the
contrary
connie
i
think
i
understand
you
almost
as
well
as
mamma
but
there
isn
t
so
much
to
understand
yet
you
know
as
there
will
her
merriment
returned
tell
me
what
girls
are
like
then
or
i
shall
sulk
all
day
because
you
say
there
isn
t
so
much
in
me
as
in
well
i
think
if
the
boys
are
like
sparrows
the
girls
are
like
swallows
did
you
ever
watch
them
before
rain
connie
skimming
about
over
the
lawn
as
if
it
were
water
low
towards
its
surface
but
never
alighting
you
never
see
them
grubbing
after
worms
nothing
less
than
things
with
wings
like
themselves
will
satisfy
them
they
will
be
obliged
to
the
earth
only
for
a
little
mud
to
build
themselves
nests
with
for
the
rest
they
live
in
the
air
and
on
the
creatures
of
the
air
and
then
when
they
fancy
the
air
begins
to
be
uncivil
sending
little
shoots
of
cold
through
their
warm
feathers
they
vanish
they
won
t
stand
it
they
re
off
to
a
warmer
climate
and
you
never
know
till
you
find
they
re
not
there
any
more
there
connie
i
don
t
know
papa
whether
you
are
making
game
of
us
or
not
if
you
are
not
then
i
wish
all
you
say
were
quite
true
of
us
if
you
are
then
i
think
it
is
not
quite
like
you
to
be
i
am
no
believer
in
satire
connie
and
i
didn
t
mean
any
the
swallows
are
lovely
creatures
and
there
would
be
no
harm
if
the
girls
were
a
little
steadier
than
the
swallows
further
satire
than
that
i
am
innocent
i
don
t
mind
that
much
papa
only
i
m
steady
enough
and
no
thanks
to
me
for
it
she
added
with
a
sigh
connie
i
said
it
s
all
for
the
sake
of
your
wings
that
you
re
kept
in
your
she
did
not
stay
out
long
this
first
day
for
the
life
the
air
gave
her
soon
tired
her
weak
body
but
the
next
morning
she
was
brighter
and
better
and
longing
to
get
up
and
go
out
again
when
she
was
once
more
laid
on
her
couch
on
the
lawn
in
the
midst
of
the
world
of
light
and
in
which
the
light
was
the
busiest
of
all
she
said
to
me
papa
i
had
such
a
strange
dream
last
night
shall
i
tell
it
you
if
you
please
my
dear
i
am
very
fond
of
dreams
that
have
any
sense
in
them
or
even
of
any
that
have
good
nonsense
in
them
i
woke
this
morning
saying
to
myself
dante
the
poet
must
have
been
a
respectable
man
for
he
was
permitted
by
the
council
of
florence
to
carry
the
nicene
creed
and
the
multiplication
table
in
his
coat
of
now
tell
me
your
connie
laughed
all
the
household
tried
to
make
connie
laugh
and
generally
succeeded
it
was
quite
a
triumph
to
charlie
or
harry
and
was
sure
to
be
recounted
with
glee
at
the
next
meal
when
he
succeeded
in
making
connie
laugh
mine
wasn
t
a
dream
to
make
me
laugh
it
was
too
dreadful
at
first
and
too
delightful
afterwards
i
suppose
it
was
getting
out
for
the
first
time
yesterday
that
made
me
dream
it
i
thought
i
was
lying
quite
still
without
breathing
even
with
my
hands
straight
down
by
my
sides
and
my
eyes
closed
i
did
not
choose
to
open
them
for
i
knew
that
if
i
did
i
should
see
nothing
but
the
inside
of
the
lid
of
my
coffin
i
did
not
mind
it
much
at
first
for
i
was
very
quiet
and
not
uncomfortable
everything
was
as
silent
as
it
should
be
for
i
was
ten
feet
and
a
half
under
the
surface
of
the
earth
in
the
churchyard
old
sogers
was
not
far
from
me
on
one
side
and
that
was
a
comfort
only
there
was
a
thick
wall
of
earth
between
but
as
the
time
went
on
i
began
to
get
uncomfortable
i
could
not
help
thinking
how
long
i
should
have
to
wait
for
the
resurrection
somehow
i
had
forgotten
all
that
you
teach
us
about
that
perhaps
it
was
a
punishment
the
dream
for
forgetting
silly
child
your
dream
is
far
better
than
your
well
i
ll
go
on
with
my
dream
i
lay
a
long
time
till
i
got
very
tired
and
wanted
to
get
up
o
so
much
but
still
i
lay
and
although
i
tried
i
could
not
move
hand
or
foot
at
last
i
burst
out
crying
i
was
ashamed
of
crying
in
my
coffin
but
i
couldn
t
bear
it
any
longer
i
thought
i
was
quite
disgraced
for
everybody
was
expected
to
be
perfectly
quiet
and
patient
down
there
but
the
moment
i
began
to
cry
i
heard
a
sound
and
when
i
listened
it
was
the
sound
of
spades
and
pickaxes
it
went
on
and
on
and
came
nearer
and
nearer
and
then
it
was
so
strange
i
was
dreadfully
frightened
at
the
idea
of
the
light
and
the
wind
and
of
the
people
seeing
me
in
my
coffin
and
my
and
tried
to
persuade
myself
that
it
was
somebody
else
they
were
digging
for
or
that
they
were
only
going
to
lay
another
coffin
over
mine
and
i
thought
that
if
it
was
you
papa
i
shouldn
t
mind
how
long
i
lay
there
for
i
shouldn
t
feel
a
bit
lonely
even
though
we
could
not
speak
a
word
to
each
other
all
the
time
but
the
sounds
came
on
nearer
and
nearer
and
at
last
a
pickaxe
struck
with
a
blow
that
jarred
me
all
through
upon
the
lid
of
the
coffin
right
over
my
head
here
she
is
poor
thing
i
heard
a
sweet
voice
say
i
m
so
glad
we
ve
found
her
said
another
voice
she
couldn
t
bear
it
any
longer
said
a
third
more
pitiful
voice
than
either
of
the
others
i
heard
her
first
it
went
on
i
was
away
up
in
orion
when
i
thought
i
heard
a
woman
crying
that
oughtn
t
to
be
crying
and
i
stopped
and
listened
and
i
heard
her
again
then
i
knew
that
it
was
one
of
the
buried
ones
and
that
she
had
been
buried
long
enough
and
was
ready
for
the
resurrection
so
as
any
business
can
wait
except
that
i
flew
here
and
there
till
i
fell
in
with
the
rest
of
i
think
papa
that
this
must
have
been
because
of
what
you
were
saying
the
other
evening
about
the
mysticism
of
paul
that
while
he
defended
with
all
his
might
the
actual
resurrection
of
christ
and
the
resurrection
of
those
he
came
to
save
he
used
it
as
meaning
something
more
yet
as
a
symbol
for
our
coming
out
of
the
death
of
sin
into
the
life
of
truth
isn
t
that
right
papa
yes
my
dear
i
believe
so
but
i
want
to
hear
your
dream
first
and
then
your
way
of
accounting
for
there
isn
t
much
more
of
it
there
must
be
the
best
of
yes
i
allow
that
well
while
they
spoke
it
was
a
wonderfully
clear
and
connected
dream
i
never
had
one
like
it
for
that
or
for
anything
else
they
were
clearing
away
the
earth
and
stones
from
the
top
of
my
coffin
and
i
lay
trembling
and
expecting
to
be
looked
at
like
a
thing
in
a
box
as
i
was
every
moment
but
they
lifted
me
coffin
and
all
out
of
the
grave
for
i
felt
the
motion
of
it
up
then
they
set
it
down
and
i
heard
them
taking
the
lid
off
but
after
the
lid
was
off
it
did
not
seem
to
make
much
difference
to
me
i
could
not
open
my
eyes
i
saw
no
light
and
felt
no
wind
blowing
upon
me
but
i
heard
whispering
about
me
then
i
felt
warm
soft
hands
washing
my
face
and
then
i
felt
wafts
of
wind
coming
on
my
face
and
thought
they
came
from
the
waving
of
wings
and
when
they
had
washed
my
eyes
the
air
came
upon
them
so
sweet
and
cool
and
i
opened
them
i
thought
and
here
i
was
lying
on
this
couch
with
butterflies
and
bees
flitting
and
buzzing
about
me
the
brook
singing
somewhere
near
me
and
a
lark
up
in
the
sky
but
there
were
no
angels
only
plenty
of
light
and
wind
and
living
creatures
and
i
don
t
think
i
ever
knew
before
what
happiness
meant
wasn
t
it
a
resurrection
papa
to
come
out
of
the
grave
into
such
a
world
as
this
indeed
it
was
my
darling
and
a
very
beautiful
and
true
dream
there
is
no
need
for
me
to
moralise
it
to
you
for
you
have
done
so
for
yourself
already
but
not
only
do
i
think
that
the
coming
out
of
sin
into
goodness
out
of
unbelief
into
faith
in
god
is
like
your
dream
but
i
do
expect
that
no
dream
of
such
delight
can
come
up
to
the
sense
of
fresh
life
and
being
that
we
shall
have
when
we
get
on
the
higher
body
after
this
one
won
t
serve
our
purpose
any
longer
and
is
worn
out
and
cast
aside
the
very
ability
of
the
mind
whether
of
itself
or
by
some
inspiration
of
the
almighty
to
dream
such
things
is
a
proof
of
our
capacity
for
such
things
a
proof
i
think
that
for
such
things
we
were
made
here
comes
in
the
chance
for
faith
in
god
the
confidence
in
his
being
and
perfection
that
he
would
not
have
made
us
capable
without
meaning
to
fill
that
capacity
if
he
is
able
to
make
us
capable
that
is
the
harder
half
done
already
the
other
he
can
easily
do
and
if
he
is
love
he
will
do
it
you
should
thank
god
for
that
dream
i
was
afraid
to
do
that
that
is
as
much
as
to
fear
that
there
is
one
place
to
which
david
might
have
fled
where
god
would
not
find
him
the
most
terrible
of
all
where
do
you
mean
papa
dreamland
my
dear
if
it
is
right
to
thank
god
for
a
beautiful
thought
i
mean
a
thought
of
strength
and
grace
giving
you
fresh
life
and
hope
why
should
you
be
less
bold
to
thank
him
when
such
thoughts
arise
in
plainer
shape
take
such
vivid
forms
to
your
mind
that
they
seem
to
come
through
the
doors
of
the
eyes
into
the
vestibule
of
the
brain
and
thence
into
the
inner
chambers
of
the
soul
chapter
xii
the
journey
for
more
than
two
months
charlie
and
harry
had
been
preparing
for
the
journey
the
moment
they
heard
of
the
prospect
of
it
they
began
to
prepare
accumulate
and
pack
stores
both
for
the
transit
and
the
sojourn
first
of
all
there
was
an
extensive
preparation
of
consisting
as
i
was
informed
in
confidence
of
brown
sugar
ground
ginger
and
cold
water
this
store
was
however
as
near
as
i
can
judge
exhausted
and
renewed
about
twelve
times
before
the
day
of
departure
arrived
and
when
at
last
the
auspicious
morning
dawned
they
remembered
with
dismay
that
they
had
drunk
the
last
drop
two
days
before
and
there
was
none
in
stock
then
there
was
a
wonderful
and
more
successful
hoarding
of
marbles
of
a
variety
so
great
that
my
memory
refuses
to
bear
the
names
of
the
different
kinds
which
i
think
must
have
greatly
increased
since
the
time
when
i
too
was
a
boy
when
some
marbles
one
of
real
white
marble
with
red
veins
especially
produced
in
my
mind
something
of
the
delight
that
a
work
of
art
produces
now
these
were
carefully
deposited
in
one
of
the
many
divisions
of
a
huge
old
which
they
had
got
their
uncle
weir
who
could
use
his
father
s
tools
with
pleasure
if
not
to
profit
to
fit
up
for
them
with
a
multiplicity
of
boxes
and
cupboards
and
drawers
and
trays
and
slides
that
was
quite
bewildering
in
this
same
box
was
stowed
also
a
quantity
of
hair
the
gleanings
of
all
the
upon
the
premises
this
was
for
making
with
a
vague
notion
on
the
part
of
harry
that
it
was
to
be
employed
in
catching
whales
and
crocodiles
then
all
their
favourite
books
were
stowed
away
in
the
same
chest
in
especial
a
packet
of
a
dozen
penny
books
of
which
i
think
i
could
give
a
complete
list
now
for
one
afternoon
as
i
searched
about
in
the
after
a
set
of
old
library
steps
which
i
wanted
to
get
repaired
i
came
upon
the
chest
and
opening
it
discovered
my
boys
hoard
and
in
it
this
packet
of
books
i
sat
down
on
the
top
of
the
chest
and
read
them
all
through
from
jack
the
down
to
hop
o
my
thumb
without
rising
and
this
in
the
broad
daylight
with
the
yellow
sunshine
nestling
beside
me
on
the
silken
seat
richly
worked
of
a
large
chair
with
three
golden
legs
yes
i
could
tell
you
all
those
stories
not
to
say
the
names
of
them
over
yet
only
i
knew
every
one
of
them
before
finding
now
that
they
had
fared
like
good
vintages
for
if
they
had
lost
something
in
potency
they
had
gained
much
in
flavour
harry
could
not
read
these
and
charlie
not
very
well
but
they
put
confidence
in
them
notwithstanding
in
virtue
of
the
red
blue
and
yellow

then
there
was
a
box
of
sawdust
the
design
of
which
i
have
not
yet
discovered
a
huge
ball
of
string
a
rabbit
s
skin
a
noah
s
ark
an
american
clock
that
refused
to
go
for
all
the
variety
of
treatment
they
gave
it
a
box
of
and
twenty
other
things
amongst
which
was
a
huge
gilt
ball
having
an
eagle
of
brass
with
outspread
wings
on
the
top
of
it
great
was
their
consternation
and
dismay
when
they
found
that
this
magazine
could
not
be
taken
in
the
in
which
they
were
to
follow
us
to
the
station
a
good
part
of
our
luggage
had
been
sent
on
before
us
but
the
boys
had
intended
the
precious
box
to
go
with
themselves
knowing
well
however
how
little
they
would
miss
it
and
with
what
shouts
of
discovery
they
would
greet
the
forgotten
treasure
when
they
returned
i
insisted
on
the
lumbering
article
being
left
in
peace
so
that
as
man
goeth
treasureless
to
his
grave
whatever
he
may
have
accumulated
before
the
fatal
moment
they
had
to
set
off
for
the
far
country
without
chest
or
not
therefore
altogether
so
desolate
and
unprovided
for
as
they
imagined
the
abandoned
treasure
was
forgotten
the
moment
the
few
tears
it
had
occasioned
were
wiped
away
it
was
the
loveliest
of
mornings
when
we
started
upon
our
journey
the
sun
shone
the
wind
was
quiet
and
everything
was
glad
the
swallows
were
twittering
from
the
corbels
they
had
added
to
the
adornment
of
the
dear
old
house
i
m
sorry
to
leave
the
swallows
behind
said
wynnie
as
she
stepped
into
the
carriage
after
her
mother
connie
of
course
was
already
there
eager
and
for
the
journey
we
set
off
connie
was
in
delight
with
everything
especially
with
all
forms
of
animal
life
and
enjoyment
that
we
saw
on
the
road
she
seemed
to
enter
into
the
spirit
of
the
cows
feeding
on
the
rich
green
grass
of
the
meadows
of
the
donkeys
eating
by
the
roadside
of
the
horses
we
met
bravely
diligent
at
their
day
s
work
as
they
trudged
along
the
road
with
wagon
or
cart
behind
them
i
sat
by
the
coachman
but
so
that
i
could
see
her
face
by
the
slightest
turning
of
my
head
i
knew
by
its
expression
that
she
gave
a
silent
blessing
to
the
little
troop
of
a
gipsy
family
which
came
out
of
a
dingy
tent
to
look
at
the
passing
carriage
a
fleet
of
ducklings
in
a
pool
paddling
along
under
the
convoy
of
the
parent
duck
next
attracted
her
look
look
isn
t
that
delicious
she
cried
i
don
t
think
i
should
like
it
though
said
wynnie
what
shouldn
t
you
like
wynnie
asked
her
mother
to
be
in
the
water
and
not
feel
it
wet
those
feathers
they
feel
it
with
their
legs
and
their
webby
toes
said
connie
yes
that
is
some
consolation
answered
wynnie
and
if
you
were
a
duck
you
would
feel
the
good
of
your
feathers
in
winter
when
you
got
into
your
cold
bath
of
a
i
give
all
this
chat
for
the
sake
of
showing
how
connie
s
illness
had
not
in
the
least
withdrawn
her
from
nature
and
her
sympathies
had
rather
as
it
were
made
all
the
fibres
of
her
being
more
delicate
and
sympathetic
so
that
the
things
around
her
could
enter
her
soul
even
more
easily
than
before
and
what
had
seemed
to
shut
her
out
had
in
reality
brought
her
into
closer
contact
with
the
movements
of
all
vitality
we
had
to
pass
through
the
village
to
reach
the
railway
station
everybody
almost
was
out
to
bid
us
i
did
not
want
for
connie
s
sake
chiefly
to
have
any
scene
but
recalling
something
i
had
forgotten
to
say
to
one
of
my
people
i
stopped
the
carriage
to
speak
to
him
the
same
instant
there
was
a
crowd
of
women
about
us
but
connie
was
the
centre
of
all
their
regards
they
hardly
looked
at
her
mother
or
sister
had
she
been
a
martyr
who
had
stood
the
test
and
received
her
aureole
she
could
hardly
have
been
more
regarded
the
common
use
of
the
word
martyr
is
a
curious
instance
of
how
words
get
degraded
the
sufferings
involved
in
martyrdom
and
not
the
pure
will
giving
occasion
to
that
suffering
is
fixed
upon
by
the
common
mind
as
the
martyrdom
the
is
lost
sight
of
except
we
can
suppose
that
a
martyr
to
the
toothache
means
a
witness
of
the
fact
of
the
toothache
and
its
tortures
but
while
really
means
a
bearing
for
the
sake
of
the
truth
yet
there
is
a
way
in
which
any
suffering
even
that
we
have
brought
upon
ourselves
may
become
martyrdom
when
it
is
so
borne
that
the
sufferer
therein
bears
witness
to
the
presence
and
fatherhood
of
god
in
quiet
hopeful
submission
to
his
will
in
gentle
endurance
and
that
effort
after
cheerfulness
which
is
not
seldom
to
be
seen
where
the
effort
is
hardest
to
make
more
than
all
perhaps
and
rarest
of
all
when
it
is
accepted
as
the
just
and
merciful
consequence
of
and
is
endured
humbly
and
with
righteous
shame
as
the
cleansing
of
the
father
s
hand
indicating
that
repentance
unto
life
which
lifts
the
sinner
out
of
his
sins
and
makes
him
such
that
the
holiest
men
of
old
would
talk
to
him
with
gladness
and
respect
then
indeed
it
may
be
called
a
martyrdom
this
latter
could
not
be
connie
s
case
but
the
former
was
hers
and
so
far
she
might
be
called
a
martyr
even
as
the
old
women
of
the
village
designated
her
after
we
had
again
started
our
ears
were
invaded
with
shouts
from
the
behind
us
in
which
charlie
and
harry
their
grief
at
the
abandoned
chest
forgotten
as
if
it
had
never
been
were
yelling
in
the
exuberance
of
their
gladness
dora
more
staid
as
became
her
years
was
trying
to
act
the
matron
with
them
in
vain
and
old
nursie
had
enough
to
do
with
miss
connie
s
baby
to
heed
what
the
young
gentlemen
were
about
so
long
as
explosions
of
noise
was
all
the
mischief
walter
the
who
had
been
with
us
ten
years
and
was
the
main
prop
of
the
establishment
looking
after
everything
and
putting
his
hand
to
everything
with
an
indefinite
charge
ranging
from
the
nursery
to
the
and
from
the
to
the
and
who
as
we
could
not
possibly
get
on
without
him
sat
on
the
box
of
the
beside
the
driver
from
the
griffin
rather
connived
i
fear
than
otherwise
at
the
noise
of
the
youngsters
marshmallows
they
were
shouting
at
the
top
of
their
voices
as
if
they
had
just
been
released
from
a
prison
where
they
had
spent
a
wretched
childhood
and
as
it
could
hardly
offend
anybody
s
ears
on
the
open
country
road
i
allowed
them
to
shout
till
they
were
tired
which
condition
fortunately
arrived
before
we
reached
the
station
so
that
there
was
no
occasion
for
me
to
interfere
i
always
sought
to
give
them
as
much
liberty
as
could
be
afforded
them
at
the
station
we
found
weir
waiting
to
see
us
off
with
my
sister
now
in
wonderful
health
turner
was
likewise
there
and
ready
to
accompany
us
a
good
part
of
the
way
but
beyond
the
valuable
assistance
he
lent
us
in
moving
connie
no
occasion
arose
for
the
exercise
of
his
professional
skill
she
bore
the
journey
wonderfully
slept
not
unfrequently
and
only
at
the
end
showed
herself
at
length
wearied
we
stopped
three
times
on
the
way
first
at
salisbury
where
the
streams
running
through
the
streets
delighted
her
there
we
remained
one
whole
day
but
sent
the
children
and
servants
all
but
my
wife
s
maid
on
before
us
under
the
charge
of
walter
this
left
us
more
at
our
ease
at
exeter
we
stopped
only
the
night
for
connie
found
herself
quite
able
to
go
on
the
next
morning
here
turner
left
us
and
we
missed
him
very
much
connie
looked
a
little
out
of
spirits
after
his
departure
but
soon
recovered
herself
the
next
night
we
spent
at
a
small
town
on
the
borders
of
devonshire
which
was
the
limit
of
our
railway
travelling
here
we
remained
for
another
whole
day
for
the
remnant
of
the
journey
across
part
of
devonshire
and
cornwall
to
the
shore
must
be
posted
and
was
a
good
five
hours
work
we
started
about
eleven
o
clock
full
of
spirits
at
the
thought
that
we
had
all
but
accomplished
the
only
part
of
the
undertaking
about
which
we
had
had
any
uneasiness
connie
was
quite
merry
the
air
was
thoroughly
warm
we
had
an
open
carriage
with
a
hood
wynnie
sat
opposite
her
mother
dora
and
eliza
the
maid
in
the
rumble
and
i
by
the
coachman
the
road
being
very
hilly
we
had
four
horses
and
with
four
horses
sunshine
a
gentle
wind
hope
and
thankfulness
who
would
not
be
happy
there
is
a
strange
delight
in
motion
which
i
am
not
sure
that
i
altogether
understand
the
hope
of
the
end
as
bringing
fresh
enjoyment
has
something
to
do
with
it
no
doubt
the
accompaniments
of
the
motion
the
change
of
scene
the
mystery
that
lies
beyond
the
next
hill
or
the
next
turn
in
the
road
the
breath
of
the
summer
wind
the
scent
of
the
especially
and
of
all
the
earth
the
tinkling
jangle
of
the
harness
as
you
pass
the
trees
on
the
roadside
the
life
of
the
horses
the
glitter
and
the
shadow
the
cottages
and
the
roses
and
the
rosy
faces
the
scent
of
burning
wood
or
peat
from
the
chimneys
these
and
a
thousand
other
things
combine
to
make
such
a
journey
delightful
but
i
believe
it
needs
something
more
than
this
something
even
closer
to
the
human
life
to
account
for
the
pleasure
that
motion
gives
us
i
suspect
it
is
its
living
symbolism
the
hidden
relations
which
it
bears
to
the
eternal
soul
in
its
aspirations
and
longings
ever
following
after
ever
attaining
never
satisfied
do
not
misunderstand
me
my
reader
a
man
you
will
allow
perhaps
may
be
content
although
he
is
not
and
can
not
be
happy
i
feel
inclined
to
turn
all
this
the
other
way
saying
that
a
man
ought
always
to
be
happy
never
to
be
content
you
will
see
i
do
not
say
i
say
here
comes
in
his
faith
his
life
is
hid
with
christ
in
god
measureless
unbounded
all
things
are
his
to
become
his
by
blessed
lovely
gradations
of
gift
as
his
being
enlarges
to
receive
and
if
ever
the
shadow
of
his
own
necessary
incompleteness
falls
upon
the
man
he
has
only
to
remember
that
in
god
s
idea
he
is
complete
only
his
life
is
hid
from
himself
with
christ
in
god
the
infinite
if
anyone
accuses
me
here
of
mysticism
i
plead
guilty
with
gladness
i
only
hope
it
may
be
of
that
true
mysticism
which
inasmuch
as
he
makes
constant
use
of
it
paul
would
understand
at
once
i
leave
it
however
i
think
i
must
have
been
the
very
happiest
of
the
party
myself
no
doubt
i
was
younger
much
than
i
am
now
but
then
i
was
quite
with
full
confession
thereof
in
gray
hairs
and
wrinkles
why
should
not
a
man
be
happy
when
he
is
growing
old
so
long
as
his
faith
strengthens
the
feeble
knees
which
chiefly
suffer
in
the
process
of
going
down
the
hill
true
the
fever
heat
is
over
and
the
oil
burns
more
slowly
in
the
lamp
of
life
but
if
there
is
less
fervour
there
is
more
pervading
warmth
if
less
of
fire
more
of
sunshine
there
is
less
smoke
and
more
light
verily
youth
is
good
but
old
age
is
better
to
the
man
who
forsakes
not
his
youth
when
his
youth
forsakes
him
the
sweet
visitings
of
nature
do
not
depend
upon
youth
or
romance
but
upon
that
quiet
spirit
whose
meekness
inherits
the
earth
the
smell
of
that
field
of
beans
gives
me
more
delight
now
than
ever
it
could
have
given
me
when
i
was
a
youth
and
if
i
ask
myself
why
i
find
it
is
simply
because
i
have
more
faith
now
than
i
had
then
it
came
to
me
then
as
an
accident
of
nature
a
passing
pleasure
flung
to
me
only
as
the
dogs
share
of
the
crumbs
now
i
believe
that
god
that
odour
of
the
that
when
jesus
smelled
such
a
scent
about
jerusalem
or
in
galilee
he
thought
of
his
father
and
if
god
means
it
it
is
mine
even
if
i
should
never
smell
it
again
the
music
of
the
spheres
is
mine
if
old
age
should
make
me
deaf
as
the
adder
am
i
mystical
again
reader
then
i
hope
you
are
too
or
will
be
before
you
have
done
with
this
same
beautiful
mystical
life
of
ours
more
and
more
nature
becomes
to
me
one
of
god
s
books
of
poetry
not
his
grandest
that
is
history
but
his
loveliest
perhaps
and
ought
i
not
to
have
been
happy
when
all
who
were
with
me
were
happy
i
will
not
run
the
risk
of
wearying
even
my
contemplative
reader
by
describing
to
him
the
various
reflexes
of
happiness
that
shone
from
the
countenances
behind
me
in
the
carriage
but
i
will
try
to
hit
each
off
in
a
word
or
a
single
simile
my
ethelwyn
s
face
was
bright
with
the
brightness
of
a
pale
silvery
moon
that
has
done
her
harvest
work
and
a
little
weary
lifts
herself
again
into
the
deeper
heavens
from
stooping
towards
the
earth
wynnie
s
face
was
bright
with
the
brightness
of
the
morning
star
ever
growing
pale
and
faint
over
the
amber
ocean
that
brightens
at
the
sun
s
approach
for
life
looked
to
wynnie
severe
in
its
light
and
somewhat
sad
because
severe
connie
s
face
was
bright
with
the
brightness
of
a
lake
in
the
rosy
evening
the
sound
of
the
river
flowing
in
and
the
sound
of
the
river
flowing
forth
just
audible
but
itself
still
and
content
to
be
still
and
mirror
the
sunset
dora
s
was
bright
with
the
brightness
of
a
marigold
that
follows
the
sun
without
knowing
it
and
eliza
s
was
bright
with
the
brightness
of
a
cabbage
rose
radiating
this
last
is
not
a
good
simile
but
i
can
not
find
a
better
i
confess
failure
and
go
on
after
stopping
once
to
bait
during
which
operation
connie
begged
to
be
carried
into
the
parlour
of
the
little
inn
that
she
might
see
the
china
figures
that
were
certain
to
be
on
the
as
indeed
they
were
where
she
drank
a
whole
tumbler
of
new
milk
before
we
lifted
her
to
carry
her
back
we
came
upon
a
wide
high
moorland
country
the
roads
through
which
were
lined
with
gorse
in
full
golden
bloom
while
patches
of
heather
all
about
were
showing
their
bells
though
not
yet
in
their
autumnal
outburst
of
purple
fire
here
i
began
to
be
reminded
of
scotland
in
which
i
had
travelled
a
good
deal
between
the
ages
of
twenty
and
the
further
i
went
the
stronger
i
felt
the
resemblance
the
look
of
the
fields
the
stone
fences
that
divided
them
the
shape
and
colour
and
materials
of
the
houses
the
aspect
of
the
people
the
feeling
of
the
air
and
of
the
earth
and
sky
generally
made
me
imagine
myself
in
a
milder
and
more
favoured
scotland
the
west
wind
was
fresh
but
had
none
of
that
sharp
edge
which
one
can
so
often
detect
in
otherwise
warm
winds
blowing
under
a
hot
sun
though
she
had
already
travelled
so
many
miles
connie
brightened
up
within
a
few
minutes
after
we
got
on
this
moor
and
we
had
not
gone
much
farther
before
a
shout
from
the
rumble
informed
us
that
little
dora
had
discovered
the
atlantic
a
dip
in
the
high
coast
revealed
it
blue
and
bright
we
soon
lost
sight
of
it
again
but
in
connie
s
eyes
it
seemed
to
linger
still
as
often
as
i
looked
round
the
blue
of
them
seemed
the
reflection
of
the
sea
in
their
little
convex
mirrors
ethelwyn
s
eyes
too
were
full
of
it
and
a
flush
on
her
generally
pale
cheek
showed
that
she
too
expected
the
ocean
after
a
few
miles
along
this
breezy
expanse
we
began
to
descend
towards
the
down
the
winding
of
a
gradual
slope
interrupted
by
steep
descents
we
approached
this
new
chapter
in
our
history
we
came
again
upon
a
few
trees
here
and
there
all
with
their
tops
cut
off
in
a
plane
inclined
upwards
away
from
the
sea
for
the
like
a
sweeping
scythe
bend
the
trees
all
away
towards
the
land
and
keep
their
tops
mown
with
their
sharp
rushing
keen
with
salt
spray
off
the
crests
of
the
broken
waves
then
we
passed
through
some
ancient
villages
with
streets
narrow
and
steep
and
that
needed
careful
driving
and
the
frequent
pressure
of
the
break
upon
the
wheel
and
now
the
sea
shone
upon
us
with
nearer
greeting
and
we
began
to
fancy
we
could
hear
its
talk
with
the
shore
at
length
we
descended
a
sharp
hill
reached
the
last
level
drove
over
a
bridge
and
down
the
line
of
the
stream
saw
the
land
vanish
in
the
sea
a
wide
bay
then
drove
over
another
wooden
drawbridge
and
along
the
side
of
a
canal
in
which
lay
sloops
and
schooners
then
came
a
row
of
pretty
cottages
then
a
gate
and
an
ascent
and
ere
we
reached
the
rectory
we
were
aware
of
its
proximity
by
loud
shouts
and
the
sight
of
charlie
and
harry
scampering
along
the
top
of
a
stone
wall
to
meet
us
this
made
their
mother
nervous
but
she
kept
quiet
knowing
that
unrestrained
anxiety
is
always
in
danger
of
bringing
about
the
evil
it
fears
a
moment
after
we
drew
up
at
a
long
porch
leading
through
the
segment
of
a
circle
to
the
door
of
the
house
the
journey
was
over
we
got
down
in
the
little
village
of
kilkhaven
in
the
county
of
cornwall
chapter
xiii
what
we
did
when
we
arrived
we
carried
connie
in
first
of
all
of
course
and
into
the
room
which
nurse
had
fixed
upon
for
her
the
best
in
the
house
of
course
again
she
did
seem
tired
now
and
no
wonder
she
had
a
cup
of
tea
at
once
and
in
half
an
hour
dinner
was
ready
of
which
we
were
all
very
glad
after
dinner
i
went
up
to
connie
s
room
there
i
found
her
fast
asleep
on
the
sofa
and
wynnie
as
fast
asleep
on
the
floor
beside
her
the
drive
and
the
sea
air
had
had
the
same
effect
on
both
of
them
but
pleased
as
i
was
to
see
connie
sleeping
so
sweetly
i
was
even
more
pleased
to
see
wynnie
asleep
on
the
floor
what
a
wonderful
satisfaction
it
may
give
to
a
father
and
mother
to
see
this
or
that
child
asleep
it
is
when
her
kittens
are
asleep
that
the
cat
creeps
away
to
look
after
her
own
comforts
our
cat
chose
to
have
her
kittens
in
my
study
once
and
as
i
would
not
have
her
further
disturbed
than
to
give
them
another
cushion
to
lie
on
in
place
of
that
which
belonged
to
my
sofa
i
had
many
opportunities
of
watching
them
as
i
wrote
or
prepared
my
sermons
but
i
must
not
talk
about
the
cat
and
her
kittens
now
when
parents
see
their
children
asleep
especially
if
they
have
been
suffering
in
any
way
they
breathe
more
freely
a
load
is
lifted
off
their
minds
their
responsibility
seems
over
the
children
have
gone
back
to
their
father
and
he
alone
is
looking
after
them
for
a
while
now
i
had
not
been
comfortable
about
wynnie
for
some
time
and
especially
during
our
journey
and
still
more
especially
during
the
last
part
of
our
journey
there
was
something
amiss
with
her
she
seemed
constantly
more
or
less
dejected
as
if
she
had
something
to
think
about
that
was
too
much
for
her
although
to
tell
the
truth
i
really
believe
now
that
she
had
not
quite
enough
to
think
about
some
people
can
thrive
tolerably
without
much
thought
at
least
they
both
live
comfortably
without
it
and
do
not
seem
to
be
capable
of
effecting
it
if
it
were
required
of
them
while
for
others
a
large
amount
of
mental
and
spiritual
operation
is
necessary
for
the
health
of
both
body
and
mind
and
when
the
matter
or
occasion
for
so
much
is
not
afforded
them
the
consequence
is
analogous
to
what
follows
when
a
healthy
physical
system
is
not
supplied
with
sufficient
food
the
oxygen
the
source
of
life
begins
to
consume
the
life
itself
it
tears
up
the
timbers
of
the
house
to
burn
against
the
cold
or
to
use
a
different
simile
when
the
of
circumstance
does
not
strike
the
rock
and
make
the
waters
flow
such
a
mind
one
that
must
think
to
live
will
go
digging
into
itself
and
is
in
danger
of
injuring
the
very
fountain
of
thought
by
drawing
away
its
living
water
into
ditches
and
stagnant
pools
this
was
i
say
the
case
in
part
with
my
wynnie
although
i
did
not
understand
it
at
that
moment
she
did
not
look
quite
happy
did
not
always
meet
a
smile
with
a
smile
looked
almost
reprovingly
upon
the
frolics
of
the
little
and
though
kindness
itself
when
any
real
hurt
or
grief
befell
them
had
reverted
to
her
old
somewhat
dictatorial
manner
of
which
i
have
already
spoken
as
interrupted
by
connie
s
accident
to
her
mother
and
me
she
was
service
itself
only
service
without
the
smile
which
is
as
the
flame
of
the
sacrifice
and
makes
it
holy
so
we
were
both
a
little
uneasy
about
her
for
we
did
not
understand
her
on
the
journey
she
had
seemed
almost
annoyed
at
connie
s
ecstasies
and
said
to
dora
many
times
do
be
quiet
dora
although
there
was
not
a
single
creature
but
ourselves
within
hearing
and
poor
connie
seemed
only
delighted
with
the
child
s
explosions
so
i
was
but
although
i
say
i
hardly
know
why
i
was
pleased
to
see
her
thus
except
it
was
from
a
vague
belief
in
the
anodyne
of
slumber
but
this
pleasure
did
not
last
long
for
as
i
stood
regarding
my
two
treasures
even
as
if
my
eyes
had
made
her
uncomfortable
she
suddenly
opened
hers
and
started
to
her
feet
with
the
words
i
beg
your
pardon
papa
looking
almost
guiltily
round
her
and
putting
up
her
hair
hurriedly
as
if
she
had
committed
an
impropriety
in
being
caught
untidy
this
was
fresh
sign
of
a
condition
of
mind
that
was
not
healthy
my
dear
i
said
what
do
you
beg
my
pardon
for
i
was
so
pleased
to
see
you
asleep
and
you
look
as
if
you
thought
i
were
going
to
scold
o
papa
she
said
laying
her
head
on
my
shoulder
i
am
afraid
i
must
be
very
naughty
i
so
often
feel
now
as
if
i
were
doing
something
wrong
or
rather
as
if
you
would
think
i
was
doing
something
wrong
i
am
sure
there
must
be
something
wicked
in
me
somewhere
though
i
do
not
clearly
know
what
it
is
when
i
woke
up
now
i
felt
as
if
i
had
neglected
something
and
you
had
come
to
find
fault
with
me
there
anything
papa
nothing
whatever
my
child
but
you
can
not
be
well
when
you
feel
like
i
am
perfectly
well
so
far
as
i
know
i
was
so
cross
to
dora
why
shouldn
t
i
feel
happy
when
everybody
else
is
i
must
be
wicked
here
connie
woke
up
there
now
i
ve
waked
connie
wynnie
resumed
i
m
always
doing
something
i
ought
not
to
do
please
go
to
sleep
again
connie
and
take
that
sin
off
my
poor
what
nonsense
is
wynnie
talking
about
being
wicked
asked
connie
it
isn
t
nonsense
connie
you
know
i
i
know
nothing
of
the
sort
wynnie
if
it
were
me
now
and
yet
i
don
t
my
dear
children
i
said
we
must
all
pray
to
god
for
his
spirit
and
then
we
shall
feel
just
as
we
ought
to
feel
it
is
not
for
anyone
to
say
to
himself
how
he
ought
to
feel
at
any
given
moment
still
less
for
one
man
to
say
to
another
how
he
ought
to
feel
that
is
in
the
former
case
to
do
as
paul
says
he
had
learned
to
give
up
doing
to
judge
our
own
selves
which
ought
to
be
left
to
god
in
the
latter
case
it
is
to
do
what
our
lord
has
told
us
expressly
we
are
not
to
do
to
judge
other
people
you
get
your
bonnet
wynnie
and
come
out
with
me
i
am
going
to
explore
a
little
of
this
desert
island
upon
which
we
have
been
cast
away
and
you
connie
just
to
please
wynnie
must
try
and
go
to
sleep
wynnie
ran
for
her
bonnet
a
little
afraid
perhaps
that
i
was
going
to
talk
seriously
to
her
but
showing
no
reluctance
anyhow
to
accompany
me
now
i
wonder
whether
it
will
be
better
to
tell
what
we
saw
or
only
what
we
talked
about
and
give
what
we
saw
in
the
shape
in
which
we
reported
it
to
connie
when
we
came
back
into
her
room
bearing
like
the
spies
who
went
to
search
the
land
our
bunch
of
grapes
that
is
of
sweet
news
of
nature
to
her
who
could
not
go
to
gather
them
for
herself
it
think
it
will
be
the
best
plan
to
take
part
of
both
plans
when
we
left
the
door
of
the
house
we
went
up
the
few
steps
of
a
stair
leading
on
to
the
downs
against
and
amidst
and
indeed
the
rocks
buttressing
the
of
which
our
new
abode
was
built
a
life
for
a
angel
seemed
waiting
us
upon
those
downs
the
wind
still
blew
from
the
west
both
warm
and
strong
i
mean
and
the
wind
was
the
first
thing
we
were
aware
of
the
ground
underfoot
was
green
and
soft
and
springy
and
sprinkled
all
over
with
the
bright
flowers
chiefly
yellow
that
live
amidst
the
short
grasses
of
the
downs
the
shadows
of
whose
unequal
surface
were
now
beginning
to
be
thrown
east
for
the
sun
was
going
seawards
i
stood
up
stretched
out
my
arms
threw
back
my
shoulders
and
my
head
and
filled
my
chest
with
a
draught
of
the
delicious
wind
feeling
thereafter
like
a
giant
refreshed
with
wine
wynnie
stood
apparently
unmoved
amidst
the
thoughtful
and
turning
her
eyes
hither
and
thither
that
makes
me
feel
young
again
i
said
i
wish
it
would
make
me
feel
old
then
said
wynnie
what
do
you
mean
my
child
because
then
i
should
have
a
chance
of
knowing
what
it
is
like
to
feel
young
she
answered
rather
enigmatically
i
did
not
reply
we
were
walking
up
the
brow
which
hid
the
sea
from
us
the
smell
of
the
was
indescribable
in
its
homely
delicacy
and
by
the
time
we
had
reached
the
top
almost
every
sense
was
filled
with
its
own
delight
the
top
of
the
hill
was
the
edge
of
the
great
and
the
sun
was
hanging
on
the
face
of
the
mightier
opposite
and
the
sea
stretched
for
visible
miles
and
miles
along
the
shore
on
either
hand
its
wide
blue
mantle
fringed
with
lovely
white
wherever
it
met
the
land
and
scalloped
into
all
fantastic
curves
according
to
the
whim
of
the
nether
fires
which
had
formed
its
bed
and
the
rush
of
the
waves
as
they
bore
the
rising
tide
up
on
the
shore
was
the
one
music
fit
for
the
whole
ear
and
eye
touch
and
smell
were
alike
invaded
with
blessedness
i
ought
to
have
kept
this
to
give
my
reader
in
connie
s
room
but
he
shall
share
with
her
presently
the
sense
of
space
of
mighty
room
for
life
and
growth
filled
my
soul
and
i
thanked
god
in
my
heart
the
wind
seemed
to
bear
that
growth
into
my
soul
even
as
the
wind
of
god
first
breathed
into
man
s
nostrils
the
breath
of
life
and
the
sun
was
the
pledge
of
the
fulfilment
of
every
aspiration
i
turned
and
looked
at
wynnie
she
stood
pleased
but
listless
amidst
that
which
lifted
me
into
the
heaven
of
the
presence
don
t
you
enjoy
all
this
grandeur
wynnie
i
told
you
i
was
very
wicked
and
i
told
you
not
to
say
so
you
see
i
can
not
enjoy
it
papa
i
wonder
why
it
i
suspect
it
is
because
you
haven
t
room
i
know
you
mean
something
more
than
i
know
i
mean
my
dear
that
it
is
not
because
you
are
wicked
but
because
you
do
not
know
god
well
enough
and
therefore
your
being
which
can
only
live
in
him
is
cabined
cribbed
confined
bound
it
is
only
in
him
that
the
soul
has
room
in
knowing
him
is
life
and
its
gladness
the
secret
of
your
own
heart
you
can
never
know
but
you
can
know
him
who
knows
its
secret
look
up
my
darling
see
the
heavens
and
the
earth
you
do
not
feel
them
and
i
do
not
call
upon
you
to
feel
them
it
would
be
both
useless
and
absurd
to
do
so
but
just
let
them
look
at
you
for
a
moment
and
then
tell
me
whether
it
must
not
be
a
blessed
life
that
creates
such
a
glory
as
this
she
stood
silent
for
a
moment
looked
up
at
the
sky
looked
round
on
the
earth
looked
far
across
the
sea
to
the
setting
sun
and
then
turned
her
eyes
upon
me
they
were
filled
with
tears
but
whether
from
feeling
or
sorrow
that
she
could
not
feel
i
would
not
inquire
i
made
haste
to
speak
again
as
this
world
of
delight
surrounds
and
enters
your
bodily
frame
so
does
god
surround
your
soul
and
live
in
it
to
be
at
home
with
the
awful
source
of
your
being
through
the
faith
which
he
not
only
permits
but
requires
and
is
ever
teaching
you
or
rather
seeking
to
rouse
up
in
you
is
the
only
cure
for
such
feelings
as
those
that
trouble
you
do
not
say
it
is
too
high
for
you
god
made
you
in
his
own
image
therefore
capable
of
understanding
him
for
this
final
end
he
sent
his
son
that
the
father
might
with
him
come
into
you
and
dwell
with
you
till
he
does
so
the
temple
of
your
soul
is
vacant
there
is
no
light
behind
the
veil
no
cloudy
pillar
over
it
and
the
priests
your
thoughts
feelings
loves
and
desires
moan
and
are
troubled
for
where
is
the
work
of
the
priest
when
the
god
is
not
there
when
he
comes
to
you
no
mystery
no
unknown
feeling
will
any
longer
distress
you
you
will
say
he
knows
though
i
do
and
you
will
be
at
the
secret
of
the
things
he
has
made
you
will
feel
what
they
are
and
that
which
his
will
created
in
gladness
you
will
receive
in
joy
one
glimmer
of
the
present
god
in
this
glory
would
send
you
home
singing
but
do
not
think
i
blame
you
wynnie
for
feeling
sad
i
take
it
rather
as
the
sign
of
a
large
life
in
you
that
will
not
be
satisfied
with
little
things
i
do
not
know
when
or
how
it
may
please
god
to
give
you
the
quiet
of
mind
that
you
need
but
i
tell
you
that
i
believe
it
is
to
be
had
and
in
the
mean
time
you
must
go
on
doing
your
work
trusting
in
god
even
for
this
tell
him
to
look
at
your
sorrow
ask
him
to
come
and
set
it
right
making
the
joy
go
up
in
your
heart
by
his
presence
i
do
not
know
when
this
may
be
i
say
but
you
must
have
patience
and
till
he
lays
his
hand
on
your
head
you
must
be
content
to
wash
his
feet
with
your
tears
only
he
will
be
better
pleased
if
your
faith
keep
you
from
weeping
and
from
going
about
your
duties
mournful
try
to
be
brave
and
cheerful
for
the
sake
of
christ
and
for
the
sake
of
your
confidence
in
the
beautiful
teaching
of
god
whose
course
and
scope
you
can
not
yet
understand
trust
my
daughter
and
let
that
give
you
courage
and
now
the
sky
and
the
sea
and
the
earth
must
have
made
me
able
to
say
these
things
to
her
but
i
knew
that
whatever
the
immediate
occasion
of
her
sadness
such
was
its
only
real
cure
other
things
might
in
virtue
of
the
will
of
god
that
was
in
them
give
her
occupation
and
interest
enough
for
a
time
but
nothing
would
do
finally
but
god
himself
here
i
was
sure
i
was
safe
here
i
knew
lay
the
hunger
of
humanity
humanity
may
like
other
vital
forms
diseased
systems
fix
on
this
or
that
as
the
object
not
merely
of
its
desire
but
of
its
need
it
can
never
be
stilled
by
less
than
the
bread
of
life
the
very
presence
in
the
innermost
nature
of
the
father
and
the
son
we
walked
on
together
wynnie
made
me
no
reply
but
weeping
silently
clung
to
my
arm
we
walked
a
long
way
by
the
edge
of
the
cliffs
beheld
the
sun
go
down
and
then
turned
and
went
home
when
we
reached
the
house
wynnie
left
me
saying
only
thank
you
papa
i
think
it
is
all
true
i
will
try
to
be
a
better
i
went
straight
to
connie
s
room
she
was
lying
as
i
saw
her
last
looking
out
of
her
window
connie
i
said
wynnie
and
i
have
had
such
a
treat
such
a
sunset
i
ve
seen
a
little
of
the
light
of
it
on
the
waves
in
the
bay
there
but
the
high
ground
kept
me
from
seeing
the
sunset
itself
did
it
set
in
the
sea
you
do
want
the
general
gazetteer
after
all
connie
is
that
water
the
atlantic
or
is
it
not
and
if
it
be
where
on
earth
could
the
sun
set
but
in
it
of
course
papa
what
a
goose
i
am
but
don
t
make
game
of
me
i
am
too
deliciously
happy
to
be
made
game
of
i
won
t
make
game
of
you
my
darling
i
will
tell
you
about
the
sunset
the
colours
of
it
at
least
this
must
be
one
of
the
best
places
in
the
whole
world
to
see
but
you
have
had
no
tea
papa
i
thought
you
would
come
and
have
your
tea
with
me
but
you
were
so
long
that
mamma
would
not
let
me
wait
any
o
never
mind
the
tea
my
dear
but
wynnie
has
had
none
you
ve
got
a
of
your
own
haven
t
you
yes
and
a
teapot
and
there
s
the
kettle
on
the
hob
for
i
can
t
do
without
a
little
fire
in
the
then
i
ll
make
some
tea
for
wynnie
and
myself
and
tell
you
at
the
same
time
about
the
sunset
i
never
saw
such
colours
i
can
not
tell
you
what
it
was
like
while
the
sun
was
yet
going
down
for
the
glory
of
it
has
burned
the
memory
of
it
out
of
me
but
after
the
sun
was
down
the
sky
remained
thinking
about
him
and
the
thought
of
the
sky
was
in
delicate
translucent
green
on
the
horizon
just
the
colour
of
the
earth
etherealised
and
glorified
a
broad
band
then
came
another
broad
band
of
pale
and
above
that
came
the
sky
s
own
eternal
blue
pale
likewise
but
so
sure
and
changeless
i
never
saw
the
green
and
the
blue
divided
and
harmonised
by
the
before
it
was
a
wonderful
sight
if
it
is
warm
enough
we
will
carry
you
out
on
the
height
that
you
may
see
what
the
evening
will
there
is
one
thing
about
sunsets
returned
connie
two
things
that
make
me
rather
sad
about
themselves
not
about
anything
else
shall
i
tell
you
them
do
my
love
there
are
few
things
more
precious
to
learn
than
the
effects
of
nature
upon
individual
minds
and
there
is
not
a
feeling
of
yours
my
child
that
is
not
of
value
to
you
are
so
kind
papa
i
am
so
glad
of
my
accident
i
think
i
should
never
have
known
how
good
you
are
but
for
that
but
my
thoughts
seem
so
little
worth
after
you
say
so
much
about
let
me
be
judge
of
that
my
well
one
thing
is
that
we
shall
never
never
never
see
the
same
sunset
that
is
true
but
why
should
we
god
does
not
care
to
do
the
same
thing
over
again
when
it
is
once
done
it
is
done
and
he
goes
on
doing
something
new
for
to
all
eternity
he
never
will
have
done
showing
himself
by
new
fresh
things
it
would
be
a
loss
to
do
the
same
thing
but
that
just
brings
me
to
my
second
trouble
the
thing
is
lost
i
forget
it
do
what
i
can
i
can
not
remember
sunsets
i
try
to
fix
them
fast
in
my
memory
that
i
may
recall
them
when
i
want
them
but
just
as
they
fade
out
of
the
sky
all
into
blue
or
gray
so
they
fade
out
of
my
mind
and
leave
it
as
if
they
had
never
been
there
except
perhaps
two
or
three
now
though
i
did
not
see
this
one
yet
after
you
have
talked
about
it
i
shall
never
forget
it
is
not
and
never
will
be
as
if
they
had
never
been
they
have
their
influence
and
leave
that
far
deeper
than
your
memory
in
your
very
being
connie
but
i
have
more
to
say
about
it
although
it
is
only
an
idea
hardly
an
assurance
our
brain
is
necessarily
an
imperfect
instrument
for
its
right
work
perhaps
it
is
needful
that
it
should
forget
in
part
but
there
are
grounds
for
believing
that
nothing
is
ever
really
forgotten
i
think
that
when
we
have
a
higher
existence
than
we
have
now
when
we
are
clothed
with
that
spiritual
body
of
which
paul
speaks
you
will
be
able
to
recall
any
sunset
you
have
ever
seen
with
an
intensity
proportioned
to
the
degree
of
regard
and
attention
you
gave
it
when
it
was
present
to
you
but
here
comes
wynnie
to
see
how
you
i
ve
been
making
some
tea
for
you
wynnie
my
o
thank
you
papa
i
shall
be
so
glad
of
some
tea
said
wynnie
the
paleness
of
whose
face
showed
the
red
rims
of
her
eyes
the
more
plainly
she
had
had
what
girls
call
a
good
cry
and
was
clearly
the
better
for
it
the
same
moment
my
wife
came
in
why
didn
t
you
send
for
me
harry
to
get
your
tea
she
said
i
did
not
deserve
any
seeing
i
had
disregarded
proper
times
and
seasons
but
i
knew
you
must
be
i
have
been
superintending
the
arrangement
of
bedrooms
and
the
unpacking
and
twenty
different
things
said
ethelwyn
we
shall
be
so
comfortable
it
is
such
a
curious
house
have
you
had
a
nice
walk
mamma
i
never
had
such
a
walk
in
my
life
returned
wynnie
you
would
think
the
shore
had
been
built
for
the
sake
of
the
show
just
for
a
platform
to
see
sunsets
from
and
the
sea
only
the
cliffs
will
be
rather
dangerous
for
the
i
have
just
been
telling
connie
about
the
sunset
she
could
see
something
of
the
colours
on
the
water
but
not
much
o
connie
it
will
be
so
delightful
to
get
you
out
here
everything
is
so
big
there
is
such
room
everywhere
but
it
must
be
awfully
windy
in
winter
said
wynnie
whose
nature
was
always
a
little
prospective
if
not
apprehensive
but
i
must
not
keep
my
reader
longer
upon
mere
family
chat
chapter
xiv
more
about
kilkhaven
our
was
one
story
below
the
level
at
which
we
had
entered
the
parsonage
for
as
i
have
said
the
house
was
built
into
the
face
of
the
cliff
just
where
it
sunk
nearly
to
the
level
of
the
shores
of
the
bay
while
at
dinner
on
the
evening
of
our
arrival
i
kept
looking
from
the
window
of
course
and
i
saw
before
me
first
a
little
bit
of
garden
mostly
in
turf
then
a
low
stone
wall
beyond
over
the
top
of
the
wall
the
blue
water
of
the
bay
then
beyond
the
water
all
alive
with
light
and
motion
the
rocks
and
of
the
opposite
side
of
the
little
bay
not
a
quarter
of
a
mile
across
i
could
likewise
see
where
the
shore
went
sweeping
out
and
away
to
the
north
with
rock
after
rock
standing
far
into
the
water
as
if
gazing
over
the
awful
wild
where
there
was
nothing
to
break
the
deathly
waste
between
cornwall
and
newfoundland
but
for
the
moment
i
did
not
regard
the
huge
power
lying
outside
so
much
as
the
merry
blue
bay
between
me
and
those
rocks
and
if
i
moved
my
head
a
little
to
the
right
i
saw
over
the
top
of
the
low
wall
already
mentioned
and
apparently
quite
close
to
it
the
slender
yellow
masts
of
a
schooner
her
mainsail
hanging
loose
from
the
gaff
whose
peak
was
lowered
we
must
i
thought
be
on
the
very
when
i
went
out
for
my
walk
with
wynnie
i
had
turned
from
the
bay
and
gone
to
the
brow
of
the
cliffs
overhanging
the
open
sea
on
our
own
side
of
it
when
i
came
down
to
breakfast
in
the
same
room
next
morning
i
stared
the
blue
had
changed
to
yellow
the
life
of
the
water
was
gone
nothing
met
my
eyes
but
a
wide
expanse
of
dead
sand
you
could
walk
straight
across
the
bay
to
the
hills
opposite
from
the
look
of
the
rocks
from
the
perpendicular
cliffs
on
the
coast
i
had
almost
without
thinking
concluded
that
we
were
on
the
shore
of
a
bay
it
was
or
nearly
so
then
and
now
when
i
looked
westward
it
was
over
a
long
reach
of
sands
on
the
far
border
of
which
the
white
fringe
of
the
waves
was
visible
as
if
there
was
their
and
further
towards
us
they
could
not
come
beyond
the
fringe
lay
the
low
hill
of
the
atlantic
to
add
to
my
confusion
when
i
looked
to
the
right
that
is
up
the
bay
towards
the
land
there
was
no
schooner
there
i
went
out
at
the
window
which
opened
from
the
room
upon
the
little
lawn
to
look
and
then
saw
in
a
moment
how
it
was
do
you
know
my
dear
i
said
to
my
wife
we
are
just
at
the
mouth
of
that
canal
we
saw
as
we
came
along
there
are
gates
and
a
lock
just
outside
there
the
schooner
that
was
under
this
window
last
night
must
have
gone
in
with
the
tide
she
is
lying
in
the
basin
above
o
yes
papa
charlie
and
harry
broke
in
together
we
saw
it
go
up
this
morning
we
ve
been
out
ever
so
long
it
was
so
funny
charlie
went
on
everything
was
with
charlie
to
see
it
rise
up
like
a
and
then
slip
into
the
quiet
water
through
the
other
gates
and
when
i
thought
about
the
waves
tumbling
and
breaking
away
out
there
and
the
wide
yellow
sands
between
it
was
wonderful
which
was
what
charlie
meant
by
funny
to
see
the
little
vessel
lying
so
many
feet
above
it
all
in
a
still
plenty
of
repose
gathering
strength
one
might
fancy
to
rush
out
again
when
its
time
was
come
into
the
turmoil
beyond
and
dash
its
way
through
the
breasts
of
the
billows
after
breakfast
we
had
prayers
as
usual
and
after
a
visit
to
connie
whom
i
found
tired
but
wonderfully
well
i
went
out
for
a
walk
by
myself
to
explore
the
neighbourhood
find
the
church
and
in
a
word
do
something
to
shake
myself
into
my
new
garments
the
day
was
glorious
i
wandered
along
a
green
path
in
the
opposite
direction
from
our
walk
the
evening
before
with
a
on
my
right
hand
and
a
belt
of
feathery
tamarisks
on
my
left
behind
which
lay
gardens
sloping
steeply
to
a
lower
road
where
stood
a
few
pretty
cottages
turning
a
corner
i
came
suddenly
in
sight
of
the
church
on
the
green
down
above
me
a
sheltered
yet
commanding
situation
for
while
the
hill
rose
above
it
protecting
it
from
the
east
it
looked
down
the
bay
and
the
atlantic
lay
open
before
it
all
the
earth
seemed
to
lie
behind
it
and
all
its
gaze
to
be
fixed
on
the
symbol
of
the
infinite
it
stood
as
the
church
ought
to
stand
leading
men
up
the
mount
of
vision
to
the
verge
of
the
eternal
to
send
them
back
with
their
hearts
full
of
the
strength
that
springs
from
hope
by
which
alone
the
true
work
of
the
world
can
be
done
and
when
i
saw
it
i
rejoiced
to
think
that
once
more
i
was
favoured
with
a
church
that
had
a
history
of
course
it
is
a
happy
thing
to
see
new
churches
built
wherever
there
is
need
of
such
but
to
the
full
idea
of
the
building
it
is
necessary
that
it
should
be
one
in
which
the
hopes
and
fears
the
cares
and
consolations
the
loves
and
desires
of
our
forefathers
should
have
been
roofed
where
the
hearts
of
those
through
whom
our
country
has
become
that
which
it
is
from
whom
not
merely
the
of
our
bodies
but
the
of
our
spirits
has
come
down
to
us
whose
existence
and
whose
efforts
have
made
it
possible
for
us
to
be
that
which
we
are
have
before
us
worshipped
that
spirit
from
whose
fountain
the
whole
torrent
of
being
flows
who
ever
pours
fresh
streams
into
the
wearying
waters
of
humanity
so
ready
to
settle
down
into
a
stagnant
repose
therefore
i
would
far
rather
when
i
may
worship
in
an
old
church
whose
very
stones
are
a
history
of
how
men
strove
to
realise
the
infinite
compelling
even
the
powers
of
nature
into
the
task
as
i
soon
found
on
the
very
doorway
of
this
church
where
the
ripples
of
the
outspread
ocean
and
grotesque
imaginations
of
the
monsters
of
its
deeps
fixed
as
it
might
seem
for
ever
in
stone
gave
a
distorted
reflex
from
the
little
mirror
of
the
artist
s
mind
of
that
mighty
water
so
awful
so
significant
to
the
human
eye
which
yet
lies
in
the
hollow
of
the
father
s
palm
like
the
handful
that
the
weary
traveller
lifts
from
the
brook
by
the
way
it
is
in
virtue
of
the
truth
that
went
forth
in
such
and
such
like
attempts
that
we
are
able
to
hold
our
portion
of
the
infinite
reality
which
god
only
knows
they
have
founded
our
church
for
us
and
such
a
church
as
this
will
stand
for
the
symbol
of
it
for
here
we
too
can
worship
the
god
of
abraham
of
isaac
and
of
jacob
the
god
of
sidney
of
hooker
of
herbert
this
church
of
kilkhaven
old
and
worn
rose
before
me
a
history
in
stone
so
beaten
and
swept
about
by
the
wild
west
wind
for
whose
path
the
atlantic
s
level
powers
cleave
themselves
into
chasms
and
so
streamed
upon
and
washed
and
dissolved
by
the
waters
lifted
from
the
sea
and
borne
against
it
on
the
upper
tide
of
the
wind
that
you
could
almost
fancy
it
one
of
those
churches
that
have
been
buried
for
ages
beneath
the
encroaching
waters
lifted
again
by
some
mighty
revulsion
of
nature
s
heart
into
the
air
of
the
sweet
heavens
there
to
stand
marked
for
ever
with
the
of
the
nether
world
scooped
and
hollowed
and
worn
like
aeonian
rocks
that
have
slowly
but
for
ever
responded
to
the
swirl
and
eddy
of
the
wearing
waters
so
from
the
most
troublous
of
times
will
the
church
of
our
land
arise
in
virtue
of
what
truth
she
holds
and
in
spite
if
she
rises
at
all
of
the
worldliness
of
those
who
instead
of
seeking
her
service
have
sought
and
gained
the
dignities
which
if
it
be
good
that
she
have
it
in
her
power
to
bestow
them
need
the
corrective
of
a
sharply
wholesome
persecution
which
of
late
times
she
has
not
known
but
god
knows
and
the
fire
will
come
in
its
course
first
in
the
form
of
just
indignation
it
may
be
against
her
professed
servants
and
then
in
the
form
of
the
furnace
seven
times
heated
in
which
the
true
builders
shall
yet
walk
unhurt
save
as
to
their
mortal
part
i
looked
about
for
some
cottage
where
the
sexton
might
be
supposed
to
live
and
spied
a
slated
roof
nearly
on
a
level
with
the
road
at
a
little
distance
in
front
of
me
i
could
at
least
inquire
there
before
i
reached
it
however
an
elderly
woman
came
out
and
approached
me
she
was
dressed
in
a
white
cap
and
a
gown
on
her
face
lay
a
certain
repose
which
attracted
me
she
looked
as
if
she
had
suffered
but
had
consented
to
it
and
therefore
could
smile
her
smile
lay
near
the
surface
a
kind
word
was
enough
to
draw
it
up
from
the
well
where
it
lay
shimmering
you
could
always
see
the
smile
there
whether
it
was
born
or
not
but
even
when
she
smiled
in
the
very
glimmering
of
that
moonbeam
you
could
see
the
deep
still
perhaps
dark
waters
under
o
if
one
could
but
understand
what
goes
on
in
the
souls
that
have
no
words
perhaps
no
inclination
to
set
it
forth
what
had
she
endured
how
had
she
learned
to
have
that
smile
always
near
what
had
consoled
her
and
yet
left
her
her
grief
turned
it
perhaps
into
hope
should
i
ever
know
she
drew
near
me
as
if
she
would
have
passed
me
as
she
would
have
done
had
i
not
spoken
i
think
she
came
towards
me
to
give
me
the
opportunity
of
speaking
if
i
wished
but
she
would
not
address
me
good
morning
i
said
can
you
tell
me
where
to
find
the
sexton
well
sir
she
answered
with
a
gleam
of
the
smile
brightening
underneath
her
old
skin
as
it
were
i
be
all
the
sexton
you
be
likely
to
find
this
mornin
sir
my
husband
he
be
gone
out
to
see
one
o
squire
tregarva
s
hounds
as
was
took
ill
last
night
so
if
you
want
to
see
the
old
church
sir
you
ll
have
to
be
content
with
an
old
woman
to
show
you
i
shall
be
quite
content
i
assure
you
i
answered
will
you
go
and
get
the
key
i
have
the
key
in
my
pocket
sir
for
i
thought
that
would
be
what
you
d
be
after
sir
and
by
the
time
you
come
to
my
age
sir
you
ll
learn
to
think
of
your
old
bones
sir
i
beg
your
pardon
for
making
so
free
for
mayhap
says
i
to
myself
he
be
the
gentleman
as
be
come
to
take
shepherd
s
duty
for
him
be
ye
now
sir
all
this
was
said
in
a
slow
sweet
subdued
tone
nearly
of
one
pitch
you
would
have
felt
that
she
claimed
the
privilege
of
age
with
a
kind
of
mournful
gaiety
but
was
careful
and
anxious
even
not
to
presume
upon
it
and
therefore
gentle
as
a
young
girl
yes
i
answered
my
name
is
walton
i
have
come
to
take
the
place
of
my
friend
shepherd
and
of
course
i
want
to
see
the
well
she
be
a
old
church
some
things
i
think
sir
grows
more
beautiful
the
older
they
grows
but
it
ain
t
us
i
m
not
so
sure
of
that
i
said
what
do
you
mean
well
sir
there
s
my
little
grandson
in
the
cottage
there
he
ll
never
be
so
beautiful
again
them
children
du
be
the
loves
but
we
all
grows
uglier
as
we
grows
older
churches
don
t
seem
to
i
m
not
so
sure
about
all
that
i
said
again
they
did
say
sir
that
i
was
a
pretty
girl
once
i
m
not
much
to
look
at
and
she
smiled
with
such
a
gracious
amusement
that
i
felt
at
once
that
if
there
was
any
vanity
left
in
this
memory
of
her
past
loveliness
it
was
sweet
as
the
memory
of
their
old
fragrance
left
in
the
withered
leaves
of
the
roses
but
it
du
not
matter
du
it
sir
beauty
is
only
i
don
t
believe
that
i
answered
beauty
is
as
deep
as
the
heart
at
well
to
be
sure
my
old
husband
du
say
i
be
as
handsome
in
his
eyes
as
ever
i
be
but
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
for
talkin
about
myself
i
believe
it
was
the
old
church
she
set
us
on
to
the
old
church
didn
t
lead
you
into
any
harm
then
i
answered
the
beauty
that
is
in
the
heart
will
shine
out
of
the
face
again
some
day
be
sure
of
that
and
after
all
there
is
just
the
same
kind
of
beauty
in
a
good
old
face
that
there
is
in
an
old
church
you
can
t
say
the
church
is
so
trim
and
neat
as
it
was
the
day
that
the
first
blast
of
the
organ
filled
it
as
with
a
living
soul
the
carving
is
not
quite
so
sharp
the
timbers
are
not
quite
so
clean
there
is
a
good
deal
of
mould
and
and
cobwebs
about
the
old
place
yet
both
you
and
i
think
it
more
beautiful
now
than
it
was
then
well
i
believe
it
is
as
nearly
as
possible
the
same
with
an
old
face
it
has
got
stained
and
and
worn
but
if
the
organ
of
truth
has
been
playing
on
inside
the
temple
of
the
lord
which
paul
says
our
bodies
are
there
is
in
the
old
face
though
both
form
and
complexion
are
gone
just
the
beauty
of
the
music
inside
the
wrinkles
and
the
brownness
can
t
spoil
it
a
light
shines
through
it
all
that
of
the
indwelling
spirit
i
wish
we
all
grew
old
like
the
old
she
did
not
reply
but
i
thought
i
saw
in
her
face
that
she
understood
my
mysticism
we
had
been
walking
very
slowly
had
passed
through
the
quaint
and
now
the
old
woman
had
got
the
key
in
the
lock
of
the
door
whose
archway
was
figured
and
fashioned
as
i
have
described
above
with
a
dozen
mouldings
or
more
most
of
them
carved
so
chapter
xv
the
old
church
the
awe
that
dwells
in
churches
fell
upon
me
as
i
crossed
the
threshold
an
awe
i
never
fail
to
feel
heightened
in
many
cases
no
doubt
by
the
sense
of
antiquity
and
of
art
but
an
awe
which
i
have
felt
all
the
same
in
crossing
the
threshold
of
an
old
puritan
conventicle
as
the
place
where
men
worship
and
have
worshipped
the
god
of
their
fathers
although
for
art
there
was
only
the
science
of
common
bricklaying
and
for
beauty
staring
ugliness
to
the
involuntary
fancy
the
air
of
petition
and
of
holy
need
seems
to
linger
in
the
place
and
the
uncovered
head
acknowledges
the
sacred
symbols
of
human
inspiration
and
divine
revealing
but
this
was
no
ordinary
church
into
which
i
followed
the
gentlewoman
who
was
my
guide
as
entering
i
turned
my
eyes
eastward
a
flush
of
subdued
glory
invaded
them
from
the
chancel
all
the
windows
of
which
were
of
richly
stained
glass
and
the
roof
of
carved
oak
lavishly
gilded
i
had
my
thoughts
about
this
chancel
and
thence
about
chancels
generally
which
may
appear
in
another
part
of
my
story
now
i
have
to
do
only
with
the
church
not
with
the
cogitations
to
which
it
gave
rise
but
i
will
not
trouble
my
reader
with
even
what
i
could
tell
him
of
the
blending
and
contradicting
of
styles
and
modes
of
architectural
thought
in
the
edifice
age
is
to
the
work
of
contesting
human
hands
a
wonderful
harmoniser
of
differences
as
nature
brings
into
harmony
all
fractures
of
her
frame
and
even
positive
intrusions
upon
her
realm
clothes
and
discolours
them
in
the
old
sense
of
the
word
so
that
at
length
there
is
no
immediate
shock
at
sight
of
that
which
in
itself
was
crude
and
is
yet
coarse
so
the
various
architecture
of
this
building
had
been
gone
over
after
the
builders
by
the
musical
hand
of
eld
with
wonder
of
delicate
transition
and
change
of
key
that
one
could
almost
fancy
the
music
of
its
exquisite
organ
had
been
at
work
the
building
half
melting
the
sutures
wearing
the
sharpness
and
blending
the
angles
until
in
some
parts
there
was
but
the
gentle
flickering
of
the
original
conception
left
all
its
vanished
under
the
file
of
the
air
and
the
gnawing
of
the
worm
true
the
hand
of
the
restorer
had
been
busy
but
it
had
wrought
lovingly
and
gently
and
wherein
it
had
erred
the
same
influences
of
nature
though
as
yet
their
effects
were
invisible
were
already
at
work
of
the
many
making
one
i
will
not
trouble
my
reader
i
say
with
any
architectural
description
which
possibly
even
more
than
a
detailed
description
of
natural
beauty
dissociated
from
human
feeling
would
only
weary
him
even
if
it
were
not
unintelligible
when
we
are
reading
a
poem
we
do
not
first
of
all
examine
the
construction
and
dwell
on
the
rhymes
and
rhythms
all
that
comes
after
if
we
find
that
the
poem
itself
is
so
good
that
its
parts
are
therefore
worth
examining
as
being
probably
good
in
themselves
and
elucidatory
of
the
main
work
there
were
carvings
on
the
ends
of
the
benches
all
along
the
aisle
on
both
sides
well
worth
examination
and
some
of
them
even
of
description
but
i
shall
not
linger
on
these
a
word
only
about
the
columns
they
supported
arches
of
different
fashion
on
the
opposite
sides
but
they
were
themselves
similar
in
matter
and
construction
both
remarkable
they
were
of
coarse
granite
of
the
country
chiselled
but
very
far
from
smooth
not
to
say
polished
each
pillar
was
a
single
stone
with
chamfered
sides
walking
softly
through
the
ancient
house
forgetting
in
the
many
thoughts
that
arose
within
me
that
i
had
a
companion
i
came
at
length
into
the
tower
the
basement
of
which
was
open
forming
part
of
the
body
of
the
church
there
hung
many
ropes
through
holes
in
a
ceiling
above
for
was
encouraged
and
indeed
practised
by
my
friend
shepherd
and
as
i
regarded
them
i
thought
within
myself
how
delightful
it
would
be
if
in
these
days
as
in
those
of
samuel
the
word
of
god
was
precious
so
that
when
it
came
to
the
minister
of
his
people
a
fresh
vision
of
his
glory
a
discovery
of
his
meaning
he
might
make
haste
to
the
church
and
into
the
tower
lay
hold
of
the
rope
that
hung
from
the
bell
of
all
and
constrain
it
by
the
force
of
strong
arms
to
utter
its
voice
of
call
come
hither
come
hear
my
people
for
god
hath
spoken
and
from
the
streets
or
the
lanes
would
troop
the
eager
folk
the
plough
be
left
in
the
furrow
the
cream
in
the
churn
and
the
crowding
people
bring
faces
into
the
church
all
with
one
question
upon
them
what
hath
the
lord
spoken
but
now
it
would
be
answer
sufficient
to
such
a
call
to
say
but
what
will
become
of
the
butter
or
an
hour
s
ploughing
will
be
and
the
clergy
how
would
they
bring
about
such
a
time
they
do
not
even
believe
that
god
has
a
word
to
his
people
through
them
they
think
that
his
word
is
petrified
for
use
in
the
bible
and
that
the
wise
men
of
old
heard
so
much
of
the
word
of
god
and
have
so
set
it
down
that
there
is
no
need
for
any
more
words
of
the
lord
coming
to
the
prophets
of
a
land
therefore
they
look
down
upon
the
prophesying
that
is
the
preaching
of
the
word
make
light
of
it
the
best
of
them
say
these
prayers
are
everything
or
all
but
everything
hearts
are
not
set
upon
hearing
what
god
the
lord
will
speak
that
they
may
speak
it
abroad
to
his
people
again
therefore
it
is
no
wonder
if
the
church
bells
are
obedient
only
to
the
clock
are
no
longer
subject
to
the
spirit
of
the
minister
and
have
nothing
to
do
in
telegraphing
between
heaven
and
earth
they
make
little
of
this
part
of
their
duty
and
no
wonder
if
what
is
to
be
spoken
must
remain
such
as
they
speak
they
put
the
church
for
god
and
the
prayers
which
are
the
word
of
man
to
god
for
the
word
of
god
to
man
but
when
the
prophets
see
no
vision
how
should
they
have
any
word
to
speak
these
thoughts
were
passing
through
my
mind
when
my
eye
fell
upon
my
guide
she
was
seated
against
the
south
wall
of
the
tower
on
a
stool
i
thought
or
small
table
while
i
was
wandering
about
the
church
she
had
taken
her
stocking
and
wires
out
of
her
pocket
and
was
now
knitting
busily
how
her
needles
did
go
her
eyes
never
regarded
them
however
but
fixed
on
the
slabs
that
paved
the
tower
at
a
yard
or
two
from
her
feet
seemed
to
be
gazing
far
out
to
sea
for
they
had
an
infinite
objectless
outlook
to
try
her
i
took
for
the
moment
the
position
of
an
accuser
so
you
don
t
mind
working
in
church
i
said
when
i
spoke
she
instantly
rose
her
eyes
turned
as
from
the
far
to
my
face
and
light
came
out
of
them
with
a
smile
she
answered
the
church
knows
me
but
what
has
that
to
do
with
it
i
don
t
think
she
minds
it
we
are
told
to
be
diligent
in
business
you
know
yes
but
it
does
not
say
in
church
and
out
of
church
you
could
be
diligent
somewhere
else
couldn
t
you
as
soon
as
i
said
this
i
began
to
fear
she
would
think
i
meant
it
but
she
only
smiled
and
said
it
won
t
hurt
she
sir
and
my
good
man
who
does
all
he
can
to
keep
her
tidy
is
out
at
toes
and
heels
and
if
i
don
t
keep
he
warm
he
ll
be
laid
up
and
then
the
church
won
t
be
kep
nice
sir
till
he
s
up
i
was
tempted
to
go
on
but
you
could
have
sat
down
outside
there
are
some
nice
gravestones
near
and
waited
till
i
came
but
what
s
the
church
for
sir
the
sun
s
werry
hot
sir
and
shepherd
he
say
sir
that
the
church
is
like
the
shadow
of
a
great
rock
in
a
weary
land
so
you
see
if
i
was
to
sit
out
in
the
sun
instead
of
comin
in
here
to
the
cool
o
the
shadow
i
wouldn
t
be
takin
the
church
at
her
word
it
does
my
heart
good
to
sit
in
the
old
church
sir
there
s
a
something
do
seem
to
come
out
o
the
old
walls
and
settle
down
like
the
cool
o
the
day
upon
my
old
heart
that
s
nearly
tired
o
crying
and
would
fain
keep
its
eyes
dry
for
the
rest
o
the
journey
my
old
man
s
stockin
won
t
hurt
the
church
sir
and
bein
a
good
deed
as
i
suppose
it
is
it
s
none
the
worse
for
the
place
i
think
if
he
was
to
come
by
wi
the
whip
o
small
cords
i
wouldn
t
be
afeared
of
his
layin
it
upo
my
old
back
do
you
think
he
would
sir
thus
driven
to
speak
as
i
thought
i
made
haste
to
reply
more
delighted
with
the
result
of
my
experiment
than
i
cared
to
let
her
know
indeed
i
do
not
i
was
only
talking
it
is
but
selfish
cheating
or
work
that
the
church
s
master
drives
away
all
our
work
ought
to
be
done
in
the
shadow
of
the
i
thought
you
be
only
having
a
talk
about
it
sir
she
said
smiling
her
sweet
old
smile
nobody
knows
what
this
old
church
is
to
now
the
old
woman
had
a
good
husband
apparently
the
sorrows
which
had
left
their
mark
even
upon
her
smile
must
have
come
from
her
family
i
thought
you
have
had
a
family
i
said
interrogatively
i
ve
had
thirteen
she
answered
six
bys
and
seven
why
you
are
rich
i
returned
and
where
are
they
all
four
maidens
be
lying
in
the
churchyard
sir
two
be
married
and
one
be
down
in
the
mill
and
your
boys
one
of
them
be
lyin
beside
his
sisters
drownded
afore
my
eyes
sir
three
o
them
be
at
sea
and
two
o
them
in
it
at
sea
i
thought
what
a
wide
as
vague
to
the
imagination
almost
as
the
other
how
a
mother
s
thoughts
must
go
roaming
about
the
waste
like
birds
that
have
lost
their
nest
to
find
them
as
this
thought
kept
me
silent
for
a
few
moments
she
resumed
it
be
no
wonder
be
it
sir
that
i
like
to
creep
into
the
church
with
my
knitting
many
s
the
stormy
night
when
my
husband
couldn
t
keep
still
but
would
be
out
on
the
cliffs
or
on
the
breakwater
for
no
good
in
life
but
just
to
hear
the
roar
of
the
waves
that
he
could
only
see
by
the
white
of
them
with
the
balls
o
foam
flying
in
his
face
in
the
dark
many
s
the
such
a
night
that
i
have
left
the
house
after
he
was
gone
with
this
blessed
key
in
my
hand
and
crept
into
the
old
church
here
and
sat
down
where
i
m
sittin
now
leastways
where
i
was
sittin
when
your
reverence
spoke
to
me
and
hearkened
to
the
wind
howling
about
the
place
the
church
windows
never
rattle
sir
like
the
cottage
windows
as
i
suppose
you
know
sir
somehow
i
feel
safe
in
the
but
if
you
had
sons
at
sea
said
i
again
wishing
to
draw
her
out
it
would
not
be
of
much
good
to
you
to
feel
safe
yourself
so
long
as
they
were
in
o
yes
it
be
sir
what
s
the
good
of
feeling
safe
yourself
but
it
let
you
know
other
people
be
safe
too
it
s
when
you
don
t
feel
safe
yourself
that
you
feel
other
people
ben
t
but
i
said
and
such
confidence
i
had
from
what
she
had
already
uttered
that
i
was
sure
the
experiment
was
not
a
cruel
one
some
of
your
sons
drowned
for
all
that
you
say
about
their
well
sir
she
answered
with
a
sigh
i
trust
they
re
none
the
less
safe
for
that
it
would
be
a
strange
thing
for
an
old
woman
like
me
threescore
and
ten
to
suppose
that
safety
lay
in
not
being
drownded
why
they
might
ha
been
cast
on
a
desert
island
and
wasted
to
skin
an
bone
and
got
home
again
wi
the
loss
of
half
the
wits
they
set
out
with
wouldn
t
that
ha
been
worse
than
being
drownded
right
off
and
that
wouldn
t
ha
been
the
worst
either
the
church
she
seem
to
tell
me
all
the
time
that
for
all
the
roaring
outside
there
be
really
no
danger
after
all
what
matter
if
they
go
to
the
bottom
what
is
the
bottom
of
the
sea
sir
you
bein
a
clergyman
can
tell
that
sir
i
shouldn
t
ha
known
it
if
i
hadn
t
had
bys
o
my
own
at
sea
sir
but
you
can
tell
sir
though
you
ain
t
got
none
and
though
she
was
putting
her
parson
to
his
catechism
the
smile
that
returned
on
her
face
was
as
modest
as
if
she
had
only
been
listening
to
his
instruction
i
had
not
long
to
look
for
my
answer
the
hollow
of
his
hand
i
said
and
said
no
more
i
thought
you
would
know
it
sir
she
returned
with
a
little
glow
of
triumph
in
her
tone
well
then
that
s
just
what
the
church
tells
me
when
i
come
in
here
in
the
stormy
nights
i
bring
my
knitting
then
too
sir
for
i
can
knit
in
the
dark
as
well
as
in
the
light
almost
and
when
they
come
home
if
they
do
come
home
they
re
none
the
worse
that
i
went
to
the
old
church
to
pray
for
them
there
it
goes
roaring
about
them
poor
dears
all
out
there
and
their
old
mother
sitting
still
as
a
stone
almost
in
the
quiet
old
church
a
caring
for
them
and
then
it
do
come
across
me
sir
that
god
be
a
sitting
in
his
own
house
at
home
hearing
all
the
noise
and
all
the
roaring
in
which
his
children
are
tossed
about
in
the
world
watching
it
all
letting
it
drown
some
o
them
and
take
them
back
to
him
and
keeping
it
from
going
too
far
with
others
of
them
that
are
not
quite
ready
for
that
same
i
have
my
thoughts
you
see
sir
though
i
be
an
old
woman
and
not
nice
to
look
i
had
come
upon
a
genius
how
nature
laughs
at
our
schools
sometimes
education
is
a
fine
thing
and
might
be
a
better
thing
but
there
is
an
education
that
of
life
which
when
seconded
by
a
pure
will
to
learn
leaves
the
schools
behind
even
as
the
horse
of
the
desert
would
leave
behind
the
slow
pomposity
of
the
goose
for
life
is
god
s
school
and
they
that
will
listen
to
the
master
there
will
learn
at
god
s
speed
for
one
moment
i
am
ashamed
to
say
i
was
envious
of
shepherd
and
repined
that
now
old
rogers
was
gone
i
had
no
such
glorious
old
window
in
my
church
to
let
in
the
eternal
upon
my
soul
i
must
say
for
myself
that
the
feeling
lasted
but
for
a
moment
and
that
no
sooner
had
the
shadow
of
it
passed
and
the
true
light
shined
after
it
than
i
was
heartily
ashamed
of
it
why
should
not
shepherd
have
the
old
woman
as
well
as
i
true
shepherd
was
more
of
what
would
now
be
called
a
ritualist
than
i
true
i
thought
my
doctrine
simpler
and
therefore
better
than
his
but
was
this
any
reason
why
i
should
have
all
the
grand
people
to
minister
to
in
my
parish
recovering
myself
i
found
her
last
words
still
in
my
ears
you
are
very
nice
to
look
at
i
said
you
must
not
find
fault
with
the
work
of
god
because
you
would
like
better
to
be
young
and
pretty
than
to
be
as
you
now
are
time
and
time
s
rents
and
furrows
are
all
his
making
and
his
doing
god
makes
nothing
are
you
quite
sure
of
that
sir
i
paused
such
a
question
from
such
a
woman
must
give
us
and
as
i
paused
the
thought
of
certain
animals
flashed
into
my
mind
and
i
could
not
insist
that
god
had
never
made
anything
ugly
no
i
am
not
sure
of
it
i
answered
for
of
all
things
my
soul
recoiled
from
any
professional
pretence
of
knowing
more
than
i
did
know
seemed
to
me
the
most
repugnant
to
the
spirit
and
mind
of
the
master
whose
servants
we
are
or
but
the
servants
of
mere
priestly
delusion
and
but
if
he
does
i
went
on
to
say
it
must
be
that
we
may
see
what
it
is
like
and
therefore
not
like
then
unwilling
all
at
once
to
plunge
with
her
into
such
an
abyss
as
the
question
opened
i
turned
the
conversation
to
an
object
on
which
my
eyes
had
been
for
some
time
resting
it
was
the
sort
of
stool
or
bench
on
which
my
guide
had
been
sitting
i
now
thought
it
was
some
kind
of
box
or
chest
it
was
curiously
carved
in
old
oak
very
much
like
the
ends
of
the
benches
and
what
is
that
you
were
sitting
on
i
asked
a
chest
or
what
it
be
there
when
we
come
to
this
place
and
that
be
nigh
fifty
years
agone
sir
but
what
it
be
you
ll
be
better
able
to
tell
than
i
be
perhaps
a
chest
for
holding
the
in
old
time
i
said
but
how
should
it
then
come
to
be
banished
to
the
tower
no
sir
it
can
t
be
that
it
be
some
sort
of
ancient
musical
piano
i
be
i
stooped
and
saw
that
its
lid
was
shaped
like
the
cover
of
an
organ
with
some
difficulty
i
opened
it
and
there
to
be
sure
was
a
row
of
huge
keys
fit
for
the
fingers
of
a
cyclops
i
pressed
upon
them
one
after
another
but
no
sound
followed
they
were
stiff
to
the
touch
and
once
down
so
they
mostly
remained
until
lifted
again
i
looked
if
there
was
any
sign
of
a
bellows
thinking
it
must
have
been
some
primitive
kind
of
like
what
we
call
a
seraphine
or
harmonium
but
there
was
no
hole
through
which
there
could
have
been
any
communication
with
or
from
a
bellows
although
there
might
have
been
a
small
one
inside
there
were
however
a
dozen
little
round
holes
in
the
fixed
part
of
the
top
which
might
afford
some
clue
to
the
mystery
of
its
former
life
i
could
not
find
any
way
of
reaching
the
inside
of
it
so
strongly
was
it
put
together
therefore
i
was
left
i
thought
to
the
efforts
of
my
imagination
alone
for
any
hope
of
discovery
with
regard
to
the
instrument
seeing
further
observation
was
impossible
but
here
i
found
that
i
was
mistaken
in
two
important
conclusions
the
latter
of
which
depended
on
the
former
the
first
of
these
was
that
it
was
an
instrument
it
was
only
one
end
of
an
instrument
therefore
secondly
there
might
be
room
for
observation
still
but
i
found
this
out
by
accident
which
has
had
a
share
in
most
discoveries
and
which
meaning
a
something
that
falls
into
our
hands
unlocked
for
is
so
far
an
unobjectionable
word
even
to
the
man
who
does
not
believe
in
chance
i
had
for
the
time
given
up
the
question
as
insoluble
and
was
gazing
about
the
place
when
glancing
up
at
the
holes
in
the
ceiling
through
which
the
went
i
spied
two
or
three
thick
wires
hanging
through
the
same
ceiling
close
to
the
wall
and
right
over
the
box
with
the
keys
the
vague
suspicion
of
a
discovery
dawned
upon
me
have
you
got
the
key
of
the
tower
i
asked
no
sir
but
i
ll
run
home
for
it
at
once
she
answered
and
rising
she
went
out
in
haste
run
thought
i
looking
after
her
it
is
a
word
of
the
will
and
the
feeling
not
of
the
but
i
was
mistaken
the
dear
old
creature
had
no
sooner
got
outside
of
the
within
which
i
presume
she
felt
that
she
must
be
decorous
than
she
did
run
and
ran
well
too
i
was
on
the
point
of
starting
after
her
at
full
speed
to
prevent
her
from
hurting
herself
but
reflecting
that
her
own
judgment
ought
to
be
as
good
as
mine
in
such
a
case
i
returned
and
sitting
down
on
her
seat
awaited
her
reappearance
gazing
at
the
ceiling
there
i
either
saw
or
imagined
i
saw
signs
of
openings
corresponding
in
number
and
position
with
those
in
the
lid
under
me
in
about
three
minutes
the
old
woman
returned
panting
but
not
distressed
with
a
great
crooked
old
key
in
her
hand
why
are
all
the
keys
of
a
church
so
crooked
i
did
not
ask
her
that
question
though
what
i
said
to
her
was
you
shouldn
t
run
like
that
i
am
in
no
be
you
not
sir
i
thought
by
the
way
you
spoke
you
be
taken
with
a
longing
to
get
o
the
tower
and
see
all
about
you
like
for
you
see
sir
fond
as
i
be
of
the
old
church
i
du
feel
sometimes
as
if
she
d
smother
me
and
then
nothing
will
do
but
i
must
get
at
the
top
of
the
old
tower
and
then
what
with
the
sun
if
there
be
any
sun
and
what
with
the
fresh
air
which
there
always
be
up
there
sir
it
du
always
be
fresh
up
there
sir
she
repeated
i
come
back
down
again
blessing
the
old
church
for
its
as
she
spoke
she
was
toiling
up
the
winding
staircase
after
me
where
there
was
just
room
enough
for
my
shoulders
to
get
through
by
turning
themselves
a
little
across
the
lie
of
the
steps
they
were
very
high
but
she
kept
up
with
me
bravely
bearing
out
her
statement
that
she
was
no
stranger
to
them
as
i
ascended
however
i
was
not
thinking
of
her
but
of
what
she
had
said
strange
to
tell
the
significance
of
the
towers
or
spires
of
our
churches
had
never
been
clear
to
me
before
true
i
was
quite
awake
to
their
significance
at
least
to
that
of
the
spires
as
fingers
pointing
ever
upwards
to
regions
mild
of
calm
and
serene
air
above
the
smoke
and
stir
of
this
dim
spot
which
men
call
earth
but
i
had
not
thought
of
their
symbolism
as
lifting
one
up
above
the
church
itself
into
a
region
where
no
church
is
wanted
because
the
lord
god
almighty
and
the
lamb
are
the
temple
of
it
happy
church
indeed
if
it
destroys
the
need
of
itself
by
lifting
men
up
into
the
eternal
kingdom
would
that
i
and
all
her
servants
lived
pervaded
with
the
sense
of
this
her
high
end
her
one
high
calling
we
need
the
church
towers
to
remind
us
that
the
mephitic
airs
in
the
church
below
are
from
the
churchyard
at
its
feet
which
so
many
take
for
the
church
worshipping
over
the
graves
and
believing
in
death
or
at
least
in
the
material
substance
over
which
alone
death
hath
power
thus
the
church
even
in
her
corruption
lifts
us
out
of
her
corruption
sending
us
up
her
towers
and
her
spires
to
admonish
us
that
she
too
lives
in
the
air
of
truth
that
her
form
too
must
pass
away
while
the
truth
that
is
embodied
in
her
lives
beyond
forms
and
customs
and
prejudices
shining
as
the
stars
for
ever
and
ever
he
whom
the
church
does
not
lift
up
above
the
church
is
not
worthy
to
be
a
doorkeeper
therein
such
thoughts
passed
through
me
satisfied
me
and
left
me
peaceful
so
that
before
i
had
reached
the
top
i
was
thanking
the
lord
not
for
his
but
for
his
sexton
s
wife
the
old
woman
was
a
jewel
if
her
husband
was
like
her
which
was
too
much
to
expect
if
he
believed
in
her
it
would
be
enough
quite
then
indeed
the
little
child
who
answered
on
being
questioned
thereanent
as
the
scotch
would
say
that
the
three
orders
of
ministers
in
the
church
were
the
parson
clerk
and
sexton
might
not
be
so
far
wrong
in
respect
of
this
individual
case
so
in
the
ascent
and
the
thinking
associated
therewith
i
forgot
all
about
the
special
object
for
which
i
had
requested
the
key
of
the
tower
and
led
the
way
myself
up
to
the
summit
where
stepping
out
of
a
little
door
which
being
turned
only
heavenwards
had
no
pretence
for
or
claim
upon
a
curiously
crooked
key
but
opened
to
the
hand
laid
upon
the
latch
i
thought
of
the
words
of
the
judicious
hooker
that
the
assembling
of
the
church
to
learn
was
the
receiving
of
angels
descended
from
above
and
in
such
a
whimsical
turn
as
our
thoughts
will
often
take
when
we
are
not
heeding
them
i
wondered
for
a
moment
whether
that
was
why
the
upper
door
was
left
on
the
latch
forgetting
that
that
could
not
be
of
much
use
if
the
door
in
the
basement
was
kept
locked
with
the
crooked
key
but
the
whole
suggested
something
true
about
my
own
heart
and
that
of
my
fellows
if
not
about
the
church
revelation
is
not
enough
the
open
is
not
enough
if
the
door
of
the
heart
is
not
open
likewise
as
soon
however
as
i
stepped
out
upon
the
roof
of
the
tower
i
forgot
again
all
that
had
thus
passed
through
my
mind
swift
as
a
dream
for
filling
the
west
lay
the
ocean
beneath
with
a
dark
curtain
of
storm
hanging
in
perpendicular
lines
over
part
of
its
horizon
and
on
the
other
side
was
the
peaceful
solid
land
with
its
numberless
shades
of
green
its
heights
and
hollows
its
farms
and
wooded
vales
there
was
not
much
wood
its
scattered
villages
and
country
dwellings
lighted
and
shadowed
by
the
sun
and
the
clouds
beyond
lay
the
blue
heights
of
dartmoor
and
over
all
bathing
us
as
it
passed
moved
the
wind
the
spirit
of
the
whole
the
servant
of
the
sun
the
old
woman
stood
beside
me
silently
enjoying
my
enjoyment
with
a
still
smile
that
seemed
to
say
in
kindly
triumph
was
i
not
right
about
the
tower
and
the
wind
that
dwells
among
its
pinnacles
i
drank
deep
of
the
universal
flood
the
outspread
peace
the
glory
of
the
sun
and
the
haunting
shadow
of
the
sea
that
lay
beyond
like
the
visual
image
of
the
eternal
silence
as
it
looks
to
us
that
rounds
our
little
earthly
life
there
were
a
good
many
trees
in
the
and
as
i
looked
down
the
tops
of
them
in
their
richest
foliage
hid
all
the
graves
directly
below
me
except
a
single
flat
stone
looking
up
through
an
opening
in
the
leaves
which
seemed
to
have
been
just
made
for
it
to
let
it
see
the
top
of
the
tower
upon
the
stone
a
child
was
seated
playing
with
a
few
flowers
she
had
gathered
not
once
looking
up
to
the
gilded
vanes
that
rose
from
the
four
pinnacles
at
the
corners
of
the
tower
i
turned
to
the
eastern
side
and
looked
over
upon
the
church
roof
it
lay
far
below
looking
very
narrow
and
small
but
long
with
the
four
ridges
of
four
steep
roofs
stretching
away
to
the
eastern
end
it
was
in
excellent
repair
for
the
parish
was
almost
all
in
one
lord
s
possession
and
he
was
proud
of
his
church
between
them
he
and
shepherd
had
made
it
beautiful
to
behold
and
strong
to
endure
when
i
turned
to
look
again
the
little
child
was
gone
some
butterfly
fancy
had
seized
her
and
she
was
away
a
little
lamb
was
in
her
place
nibbling
at
the
grass
that
grew
on
the
side
of
the
next
mound
and
when
i
looked
seaward
there
was
a
sloop
like
a
rounding
the
end
of
a
high
projecting
rock
from
the
south
to
bear
up
the
little
channel
that
led
to
the
gates
of
the
harbour
canal
out
of
the
circling
waters
it
had
flown
home
not
from
a
long
voyage
but
hardly
the
less
welcome
therefore
to
those
that
waited
and
looked
for
her
signal
from
the
barrier
rock
reentering
by
the
angels
door
to
descend
the
narrow
stair
so
dark
and
cool
i
caught
a
glimpse
one
turn
down
by
the
feeble
light
that
came
through
its
chinks
after
it
was
shut
behind
us
of
a
tiny
fern
growing
out
of
the
wall
i
stopped
and
said
to
the
old
woman
i
have
a
sick
daughter
at
home
or
i
wouldn
t
rob
your
tower
of
this
lovely
little
well
sir
what
eyes
you
have
i
never
saw
the
thing
before
do
take
it
home
to
miss
it
ll
do
her
good
to
see
it
i
be
main
sorry
to
hear
you
ve
got
a
sick
maiden
she
ben
t
a
bedlar
be
she
sir
i
was
busy
with
my
knife
getting
out
all
the
roots
i
could
without
hurting
them
and
before
i
had
succeeded
i
had
remembered
turner
s
using
the
word
not
quite
that
i
answered
but
she
can
t
even
sit
up
and
must
be
carried
poor
dear
everyone
has
their
troubles
sir
the
sea
s
been
she
continued
talking
and
asking
kind
questions
about
connie
as
we
went
down
the
stair
not
till
she
opened
a
little
door
i
had
passed
without
observing
it
as
we
came
up
was
i
reminded
of
my
first
object
in
ascending
the
tower
for
this
door
revealed
a
number
of
bells
hanging
in
silent
power
in
the
brown
twilight
of
the
place
i
entered
carefully
for
there
were
only
some
planks
laid
upon
the
joists
to
keep
one
s
feet
from
going
through
the
ceiling
in
a
few
moments
i
had
satisfied
myself
that
my
conjecture
about
the
keys
below
was
correct
the
small
iron
rods
i
had
seen
from
beneath
hung
down
from
this
place
there
were
more
of
them
hanging
shorter
above
and
there
was
yet
enough
of
a
further
mechanism
remaining
to
prove
that
those
keys
by
means
of
the
looped
and
cranked
rods
had
been
in
connection
with
hammers
one
of
them
indeed
remaining
also
which
struck
the
bells
so
that
a
tune
could
be
played
upon
them
as
upon
any
other
keyed
instrument
this
was
the
first
contrivance
of
the
kind
i
had
ever
seen
though
i
have
heard
of
it
in
other
churches
since
if
i
could
find
a
clever
blacksmith
in
the
neighbourhood
now
i
said
to
myself
i
would
get
this
all
repaired
so
that
it
should
not
interfere
with
the
when
the
ringers
were
to
be
had
and
yet
shepherd
could
play
a
psalm
tune
to
his
parish
at
large
when
he
for
shepherd
was
a
very
fair
musician
and
gave
a
good
deal
of
time
to
the
organ
it
s
a
grand
notion
to
think
of
him
sitting
here
in
the
gloom
with
that
great
musical
instrument
towering
above
him
whence
he
sends
forth
the
voice
of
gladness
almost
of
song
to
his
people
while
they
are
mowing
the
grass
binding
the
sheaves
or
gazing
abroad
over
the
stormy
ocean
in
doubt
anxiety
and
fear
there
s
the
parson
at
his
bells
they
would
say
and
stop
and
listen
and
some
phrase
might
sink
into
their
hearts
waking
some
memory
or
giving
birth
to
some
hope
or
faint
aspiration
i
will
see
what
can
be
having
come
to
this
conclusion
i
left
the
abode
of
the
bells
descended
to
the
church
bade
my
conductress
good
morning
saying
i
would
visit
her
soon
in
her
own
house
and
bore
home
to
my
child
the
spoil
which
without
i
had
torn
from
the
wall
of
the
sanctuary
by
this
time
the
stormy
veil
had
lifted
from
the
horizon
and
the
sun
was
shining
in
full
power
without
one
darkening
cloud
ere
i
left
the
churchyard
i
would
have
a
glance
at
the
stone
which
ever
seemed
to
lie
gazing
up
at
the
tower
i
soon
found
it
because
it
was
the
only
one
in
that
quarter
from
which
i
could
see
the
top
of
the
tower
it
recorded
the
life
and
death
of
an
aged
pair
who
had
been
married
fifty
years
concluding
with
the
couplet
a
long
time
this
may
seem
to
be
but
it
did
not
seem
long
to
the
whole
story
of
a
human
life
lay
in
that
last
verse
true
it
was
not
good
grammar
but
they
had
got
through
fifty
years
of
wedded
life
probably
without
any
knowledge
of
grammar
to
harmonise
or
to
shorten
them
and
i
daresay
had
they
been
acquainted
with
the
lesson
he
had
put
into
their
dumb
mouths
they
would
have
been
aware
of
no
ground
of
quarrel
with
the
poetic
who
most
likely
had
thrown
the
verses
in
when
he
made
his
claim
for
the
stone
and
the
cutting
having
learnt
this
one
by
heart
i
went
about
looking
for
anything
more
in
the
shape
of
sepulchral
flora
that
might
interest
or
amuse
my
crippled
darling
nor
had
i
searched
long
before
i
found
one
the
sole
but
triumphant
recommendation
of
which
was
the
thorough
of
its
construction
i
quite
reckoned
on
seeing
connie
trying
to
make
it
out
looking
as
bewildered
over
its
excellent
grammar
as
the
poet
of
the
other
ought
to
have
looked
over
his
rhymes
ere
he
gave
in
to
the
use
of
the
nominative
after
a
preposition
if
you
could
view
the
heavenly
shore
where
heart
s
content
you
hope
to
find
you
would
not
murmur
were
you
gone
before
but
grieve
that
you
are
left
chapter
xvi
connie
s
as
i
walked
home
the
rush
of
the
rising
tide
was
in
my
ears
to
my
fancy
the
ocean
awaking
from
a
swoon
in
which
its
life
had
ebbed
to
its
heart
was
sending
that
life
abroad
to
its
extremities
and
waves
breaking
in
white
were
the
beats
of
its
reviving
pulse
the
flashes
of
returning
light
but
so
gentle
was
its
motion
and
so
lovely
its
hue
that
i
could
not
help
contrasting
it
with
its
reflex
in
the
mind
of
her
who
took
refuge
from
the
tumult
of
its
noises
in
the
hollow
of
the
old
church
to
her
let
it
look
as
blue
as
the
sky
as
peaceful
and
as
moveless
it
was
a
wild
reckless
false
devouring
creature
a
prey
to
its
own
moods
and
to
that
of
the
blind
winds
which
careless
of
consequences
urged
it
to
raving
fury
only
while
the
sea
took
this
form
to
her
imagination
she
believed
in
that
which
held
the
sea
and
knew
that
when
it
pleased
god
to
part
his
confining
fingers
there
would
be
no
more
sea
when
i
reached
home
i
went
straight
to
connie
s
room
now
the
house
was
one
of
a
class
to
every
individual
of
which
whatever
be
its
style
or
shape
i
instantly
become
attached
almost
as
if
it
possessed
a
measure
of
the
life
which
it
has
sheltered
this
class
of
human
dwellings
consists
of
the
houses
that
have
they
have
not
been
built
after
a
model
of
uninteresting
convenience
or
pinchedness
they
must
have
had
some
plan
good
bad
or
indifferent
as
the
case
may
be
at
first
i
suppose
but
that
plan
they
have
left
far
behind
having
grown
with
the
necessities
or
ambitions
of
succeeding
possessors
until
the
fact
that
they
have
a
history
is
as
plainly
written
on
their
aspect
as
on
that
of
any
you
or
daughter
of
adam
these
are
the
houses
which
the
fairies
used
to
haunt
and
if
there
is
any
truth
in
the
houses
which
ghosts
will
yet
haunt
and
hence
perhaps
the
sense
of
soothing
comfort
which
pervades
us
when
we
cross
their
thresholds
you
do
not
know
the
moment
you
have
cast
a
glance
about
the
hall
where
the
and
best
bedroom
are
you
have
got
it
all
to
find
out
just
as
the
character
of
a
man
and
thus
had
i
to
find
out
this
house
of
my
friend
shepherd
it
had
formerly
been
a
kind
of
though
altogether
unlike
any
other
i
ever
saw
for
after
exercising
all
my
constructive
ingenuity
reversed
in
pulling
it
to
pieces
in
my
mind
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
of
it
was
a
cottage
of
the
simplest
sort
which
had
grown
by
the
addition
of
other
cells
till
it
had
reached
the
development
in
which
we
found
it
i
have
said
that
the
was
almost
on
the
level
of
the
shore
certainly
some
of
the
flat
stones
that
coped
the
low
wall
in
front
of
it
were
thrown
into
the
garden
before
the
next
winter
by
the
waves
but
connie
s
room
looked
out
on
a
little
almost
on
the
downs
only
sheltered
a
little
by
the
rise
of
a
short
grassy
slope
above
it
this
however
left
the
prospect
from
her
window
down
the
bay
and
out
to
sea
almost
open
to
reach
this
room
i
had
now
to
go
up
but
one
simple
cottage
stair
for
the
door
of
the
house
entered
on
the
first
floor
that
is
as
regards
the
building
midway
between
heaven
and
earth
it
had
a
large
and
in
this
window
connie
was
lying
on
her
couch
with
the
lower
sash
wide
open
through
which
the
breeze
entered
smelling
of
tempered
with
sweet
grasses
and
the
and
stocks
that
were
in
the
little
plot
under
it
i
thought
i
could
see
an
improvement
in
her
already
certainly
she
looked
very
happy
o
papa
she
said
isn
t
it
delightful
what
is
my
dear
o
everything
the
wind
and
the
sky
and
the
sea
and
the
smell
of
the
flowers
do
look
at
that
his
wings
are
like
the
barb
of
a
terrible
arrow
how
he
goes
undulating
neck
and
body
up
and
down
as
he
flies
i
never
felt
before
that
a
bird
moves
his
wings
it
always
looked
as
if
the
wings
flew
with
the
bird
but
i
see
the
effort
in
an
easy
effort
though
i
should
certainly
no
doubt
but
i
see
that
he
chooses
and
means
to
fly
and
so
does
it
it
makes
one
almost
reconciled
to
the
idea
of
wings
do
angels
really
have
wings
papa
it
is
generally
so
represented
i
think
in
the
bible
but
whether
it
is
meant
as
a
natural
fact
about
them
is
more
than
i
take
upon
me
to
decide
for
one
thing
i
should
have
to
examine
whether
in
simple
narrative
they
are
ever
represented
with
them
as
i
think
in
records
of
visions
they
are
never
represented
without
them
but
wings
are
very
beautiful
things
and
i
do
not
exactly
see
why
you
should
need
reconciling
to
connie
gave
a
little
shrug
of
her
shoulders
i
don
t
like
the
notion
of
them
growing
out
at
my
and
however
would
you
get
on
your
clothes
if
you
put
them
over
your
wings
they
would
be
of
no
use
and
would
besides
make
you
and
if
you
did
not
everything
would
have
to
be
buttoned
round
the
roots
of
them
you
could
not
do
it
yourself
and
even
on
wynnie
i
don
t
think
i
could
bear
to
touch
the
things
i
don
t
mean
the
feathers
but
the
skinny
bits
of
i
laughed
at
her
fastidious
fancy
you
want
to
fly
i
suppose
i
said
o
yes
i
should
like
and
you
don
t
want
to
have
wings
well
i
shouldn
t
mind
the
wings
exactly
but
however
would
one
be
able
to
keep
them
nice
there
you
go
starting
from
one
thing
to
another
like
a
real
bird
already
when
you
can
t
answer
one
thing
off
to
another
and
from
your
new
perch
on
the
hawthorn
talk
as
if
you
were
still
on
the
topmost
branch
of
the
lilac
o
yes
papa
that
s
what
i
ve
heard
you
say
to
mamma
twenty
and
did
i
ever
say
to
your
mamma
anything
but
the
truth
or
to
you
either
you
puss
i
had
not
yet
discovered
that
when
i
used
this
epithet
to
my
connie
she
always
thought
she
had
gone
too
far
she
looked
troubled
i
hastened
to
relieve
her
when
women
have
wings
i
said
their
logic
will
be
how
do
you
make
that
out
papa
she
asked
a
little
because
then
every
shadow
of
feeling
that
turns
your
speech
aside
from
the
straight
course
will
be
recognised
in
that
speech
the
whole
utterance
will
be
instinct
not
only
with
the
meaning
of
what
you
are
thinking
but
with
the
reflex
of
the
forces
in
you
that
make
the
utterance
take
this
or
that
shape
just
as
to
a
perfect
palate
the
source
and
course
of
a
stream
would
be
revealed
in
every
draught
of
its
water
i
have
just
a
glimmering
of
your
meaning
papa
would
you
like
to
have
wings
i
should
like
to
fly
like
a
bird
to
swim
like
a
fish
to
gallop
like
a
horse
to
creep
like
a
serpent
but
i
suspect
the
good
of
all
these
is
to
be
got
without
doing
any
of
i
know
what
you
mean
now
but
i
can
t
put
it
in
i
mean
by
a
perfect
sympathy
with
the
creatures
that
do
these
things
what
it
may
please
god
to
give
to
ourselves
we
can
quite
comfortably
leave
to
him
a
higher
stratum
of
the
same
kind
is
the
need
we
feel
of
knowing
our
through
and
through
of
walking
into
and
out
of
their
worlds
as
if
we
were
because
we
are
perfectly
at
home
in
but
i
am
talking
what
the
people
who
do
not
understand
such
things
lump
all
together
as
mysticism
which
is
their
name
for
a
kind
of
spiritual
whither
they
consign
dust
and
stones
never
asking
whether
they
may
not
be
and
rubies
all
in
a
you
had
better
begin
to
think
about
getting
out
think
about
it
papa
i
have
been
thinking
about
it
ever
since
i
will
go
and
see
what
your
mother
is
doing
then
and
if
she
is
ready
to
go
out
with
in
a
few
moments
all
was
arranged
without
killing
more
than
a
snail
or
two
which
we
could
not
take
time
to
beware
of
walter
and
i
finding
that
the
window
did
not
open
down
to
the
ground
in
french
fashion
for
which
there
were
two
good
reasons
one
the
fierceness
of
the
winds
in
winter
the
other
the
fact
that
the
means
of
egress
were
elsewise
provided
lifted
the
sofa
connie
and
all
out
over
the
and
then
there
was
only
a
little
door
in
the
to
get
her
through
before
we
found
ourselves
upon
the
down
i
think
the
ascent
of
this
hill
was
the
first
experience
i
had
a
little
to
my
humiliation
nothing
to
my
sorrow
that
i
was
descending
another
hill
i
had
to
set
down
the
precious
burden
rather
oftener
before
we
reached
the
brow
of
the
cliffs
than
would
have
been
necessary
ten
years
before
but
this
was
all
right
and
the
weakness
then
was
strength
to
the
power
which
carries
me
about
on
my
two
legs
now
it
is
all
right
still
i
shall
be
stronger
by
and
by
we
carried
her
high
enough
for
her
to
see
the
brilliant
waters
lying
many
feet
below
her
with
the
of
which
we
had
talked
winging
their
undulating
way
between
heaven
and
ocean
it
is
when
first
you
have
a
chance
of
looking
a
bird
in
the
face
on
the
wing
that
you
know
what
the
marvel
of
flight
is
there
it
hangs
or
rests
which
you
please
borne
up
as
far
as
eye
or
any
of
the
senses
can
witness
by
its
own
will
alone
this
connie
quicker
than
i
in
her
observation
of
nature
had
already
observed
seated
on
the
warm
grass
by
her
side
while
neither
talked
but
both
regarded
the
blue
spaces
i
saw
one
of
those
same
birds
rest
over
my
head
regarding
me
from
above
as
if
doubtful
whether
i
did
not
afford
some
claim
to
his
theory
of
i
knew
at
once
that
what
connie
had
been
saying
to
me
just
before
was
true
she
lay
silent
a
long
time
i
too
was
silent
at
length
i
spoke
are
you
longing
to
be
running
about
amongst
the
rocks
my
connie
no
papa
not
a
bit
i
don
t
know
how
it
is
but
i
don
t
think
i
ever
wished
much
for
anything
i
knew
i
could
not
have
i
am
enjoying
everything
more
than
i
can
tell
you
i
wish
wynnie
were
as
happy
as
i
why
do
you
think
she
s
not
happy
my
dear
that
doesn
t
want
any
thinking
papa
you
can
see
i
am
afraid
you
re
right
connie
what
do
you
think
is
the
cause
of
it
i
think
it
is
because
she
can
t
wait
she
s
always
going
out
to
meet
things
and
then
when
they
re
not
there
waiting
for
her
she
thinks
they
re
nowhere
but
i
always
think
her
way
is
finer
than
mine
if
everybody
were
like
me
there
wouldn
t
be
much
done
in
the
world
would
there
papa
at
all
events
my
dear
your
way
is
wise
for
you
and
i
am
glad
you
do
not
judge
your
judge
wynnie
papa
that
would
be
cool
impudence
she
s
worth
ten
of
me
don
t
you
think
papa
she
added
after
a
pause
that
if
mary
had
said
the
smallest
word
against
martha
as
martha
did
against
mary
jesus
would
have
had
a
word
to
say
on
martha
s
side
next
indeed
i
do
my
dear
and
i
think
that
did
not
sit
very
long
without
asking
jesus
if
she
mightn
t
go
and
help
her
sister
there
is
but
one
thing
needful
that
is
the
will
of
god
and
when
people
love
that
above
everything
they
soon
come
to
see
that
to
everything
else
there
are
two
sides
and
that
only
the
will
of
god
gives
fair
play
as
we
call
it
to
both
of
another
silence
followed
then
connie
spoke
is
it
not
strange
papa
that
the
only
thine
here
that
makes
me
want
to
get
up
to
look
is
nothing
of
all
the
grand
things
round
about
me
i
am
just
lying
like
the
convex
mirror
in
the
at
home
letting
them
all
paint
themselves
in
what
is
it
then
that
makes
you
wish
to
get
up
and
go
and
see
i
asked
with
real
curiosity
do
you
see
down
there
away
across
the
bay
amongst
the
rocks
at
the
other
side
a
man
sitting
sketching
i
looked
for
some
time
before
i
could
discover
him
your
sight
is
good
connie
i
see
the
man
but
i
could
not
tell
what
he
was
don
t
you
see
him
lifting
his
head
every
now
and
then
for
a
moment
and
then
keeping
it
down
for
a
longer
while
i
can
not
distinguish
that
but
then
i
am
shortsighted
rather
you
i
wonder
how
you
see
so
many
little
things
that
nobody
else
seems
to
notice
then
that
is
because
i
have
trained
myself
to
observe
the
degree
of
power
in
the
sight
is
of
less
consequence
than
the
habit
of
seeing
but
you
have
not
yet
told
me
what
it
is
that
makes
you
desirous
of
getting
i
want
to
look
over
his
shoulder
and
see
what
he
is
doing
is
it
not
strange
that
in
the
midst
of
all
this
plenty
of
beautifulness
i
should
want
to
rise
to
look
at
a
few
lines
and
scratches
or
smears
of
colour
upon
a
bit
of
paper
no
my
dear
i
don
t
think
it
is
strange
there
a
new
element
of
interest
is
introduced
the
human
no
doubt
there
is
deep
humanity
in
all
this
around
us
no
doubt
all
the
world
in
all
its
moods
is
human
as
those
for
whose
abode
and
instruction
it
was
made
no
doubt
it
would
be
void
of
both
beauty
and
significance
to
our
eyes
were
it
not
that
it
is
one
crowd
of
pictures
of
the
human
mind
blended
in
one
living
fluctuating
whole
but
these
meanings
are
there
in
solution
as
it
were
the
individual
is
a
centre
of
crystallisation
to
this
solution
around
him
meanings
gather
are
separated
from
other
meanings
and
if
he
be
an
artist
by
which
i
mean
true
painter
true
poet
or
true
musician
as
the
case
may
be
he
so
isolates
and
represents
them
that
we
see
them
not
what
nature
shows
to
us
but
what
nature
has
shown
to
him
determined
by
his
nature
and
choice
with
it
is
mingled
therefore
so
much
of
his
own
individuality
manifested
both
in
this
choice
and
certain
modifications
determined
by
his
way
of
working
that
you
have
not
only
a
representation
of
an
aspect
of
nature
as
far
as
that
may
be
with
limited
powers
and
materials
but
a
revelation
of
the
man
s
own
mind
and
nature
consequently
there
is
a
human
interest
in
every
true
attempt
to
reproduce
nature
an
interest
of
individuality
which
does
not
belong
to
nature
herself
who
is
for
all
and
every
man
you
have
just
been
saying
that
you
were
lying
there
like
a
convex
mirror
reflecting
all
nature
around
you
every
man
is
such
a
convex
mirror
and
his
drawing
if
he
can
make
one
is
an
attempt
to
show
what
is
in
this
little
mirror
of
his
kindled
there
by
the
grand
world
outside
and
the
human
mirrors
being
all
differently
formed
vary
infinitely
in
what
they
would
thus
represent
of
the
same
scene
i
have
been
greatly
interested
in
looking
alternately
over
the
shoulders
of
two
artists
both
sketching
in
colour
the
same
absolutely
the
same
scene
both
trying
to
represent
it
with
all
the
truth
in
their
power
how
different
notwithstanding
the
two
representations
came
out
i
think
i
understand
you
papa
but
look
a
little
farther
off
don
t
you
see
over
the
top
of
another
rock
a
lady
s
bonnet
i
do
believe
that
s
wynnie
i
know
she
took
her
box
of
out
with
her
this
morning
just
before
you
came
home
dora
went
with
can
t
you
tell
by
her
ribbons
connie
you
seem
enough
to
see
her
face
if
she
would
show
it
i
don
t
even
see
the
bonnet
if
i
were
like
some
people
i
know
i
should
feel
justified
in
denying
its
presence
attributing
the
whole
to
your
fancy
and
refusing
anything
to
superiority
of
that
wouldn
t
be
like
you
i
hope
not
for
i
have
no
fancy
for
being
shut
up
in
my
own
blindness
when
other
people
offer
me
their
eyes
to
eke
out
the
defects
of
my
own
with
but
here
comes
mamma
at
connie
s
face
brightened
as
if
she
had
not
seen
her
mother
for
a
fortnight
my
ethelwyn
always
brought
the
home
gladness
that
her
name
signified
with
her
she
was
a
centre
of
radiating
peace
mamma
don
t
you
think
that
s
wynnie
s
bonnet
over
that
black
rock
there
just
beyond
where
you
see
that
man
drawing
you
absurd
child
how
should
i
know
wynnie
s
bonnet
at
this
distance
can
t
you
see
the
little
white
feather
you
gave
her
out
of
your
wardrobe
just
before
we
left
she
put
it
in
this
morning
before
she
went
i
think
i
do
see
something
white
but
i
want
you
to
look
out
there
towards
what
they
call
the
chapel
rock
at
the
other
end
of
that
long
mound
they
call
the
breakwater
you
will
soon
see
a
boat
appear
full
of
the
i
saw
them
going
on
board
just
as
i
left
the
house
to
come
up
to
you
their
officer
came
down
with
his
sword
and
each
of
the
men
had
a
cutlass
i
wonder
what
it
can
we
looked
but
before
the
boat
made
its
appearance
connie
cried
out
look
there
what
a
big
boat
that
is
rowing
for
the
land
away
northwards
there
i
turned
my
eyes
in
the
direction
she
indicated
and
saw
a
long
boat
with
some
oars
full
of
men
rowing
hard
apparently
for
some
spot
on
the
shore
at
a
considerable
distance
to
the
north
of
our
bay
ah
i
said
that
boat
has
something
to
do
with
the
and
their
cutlasses
you
ll
see
that
as
soon
as
they
get
out
of
the
bay
they
will
row
in
the
same
so
it
was
our
boat
appeared
presently
from
under
the
concealment
of
the
heights
on
which
we
were
and
made
at
full
speed
after
the
other
boat
surely
they
can
t
be
smugglers
i
said
i
thought
all
that
was
over
and
done
in
the
course
of
another
twenty
minutes
during
which
we
watched
their
progress
both
boats
had
disappeared
behind
the
headland
to
the
northward
then
thinking
connie
had
had
nearly
enough
of
the
sea
air
for
her
first
experience
of
its
influences
i
went
and
fetched
walter
and
we
carried
her
back
as
we
had
brought
her
she
had
not
been
in
the
shadow
of
her
own
room
for
five
minutes
before
she
was
fast
asleep
it
was
now
nearly
time
for
our
early
dinner
we
always
dined
early
when
we
could
that
we
might
eat
along
with
our
children
we
were
both
convinced
that
the
only
way
to
make
them
behave
like
ladies
and
gentlemen
was
to
have
them
always
with
us
at
meals
we
had
seen
very
unpleasant
results
in
the
children
of
those
who
allowed
them
to
dine
with
no
other
supervision
than
the
nursery
afforded
they
were
a
constant
anxiety
and
occasional
horror
to
those
whom
they
visited
snatching
like
monkeys
and
devouring
like
jackals
as
selfishly
as
if
they
were
mere
animals
o
we
ve
seen
such
a
nice
gentleman
said
dora
becoming
lively
under
the
influence
of
her
soup
have
you
dora
where
sitting
on
the
rocks
taking
a
portrait
of
the
what
makes
you
say
he
was
a
nice
gentleman
he
had
such
beautiful
boots
answered
dora
at
which
there
was
a
great
laugh
about
the
table
o
we
must
run
and
tell
connie
that
said
harry
it
will
make
her
what
will
you
tell
connie
then
harry
o
what
was
it
charlie
i
ve
another
laugh
followed
at
harry
s
expense
now
and
we
were
all
very
merry
when
dora
who
sat
opposite
to
the
window
called
out
clapping
her
hands
there
s
niceboots
again
there
s
niceboots
again
the
same
moment
the
head
of
a
young
man
appeared
over
the
wall
that
separated
the
garden
from
the
little
beach
that
lay
by
the
entrance
of
the
canal
i
saw
at
once
that
he
must
be
more
than
ordinarily
tall
to
show
his
face
for
he
was
not
close
to
the
wall
it
was
a
dark
countenance
with
a
long
beard
which
few
at
that
time
wore
though
now
it
is
getting
not
uncommon
even
in
my
own
profession
a
noble
handsome
face
a
little
sad
with
downbent
eyes
which
released
from
their
more
immediate
duty
towards
nature
had
now
bent
themselves
upon
the
earth
counting
the
dewy
pebbles
fixed
in
i
suppose
he
s
contemplating
his
boots
said
wynnie
with
apparent
maliciousness
that
s
too
bad
of
you
wynnie
i
said
and
the
child
blushed
i
didn
t
mean
anything
papa
it
was
only
following
up
dora
s
wise
discrimination
said
wynnie
he
is
a
fellow
said
i
and
ought
with
that
face
and
head
to
be
able
to
paint
good
i
should
like
to
see
what
he
has
done
said
wynnie
for
by
the
way
we
were
sitting
i
should
think
we
were
attempting
the
same
and
what
was
that
then
wynnie
i
asked
a
rock
she
answered
that
you
could
not
see
from
where
you
were
sitting
i
saw
you
on
the
top
of
the
connie
said
it
was
you
by
your
bonnet
she
too
was
wishing
she
could
look
over
the
shoulder
of
the
artist
at
work
beside
not
beside
me
there
were
yards
and
yards
of
solid
rock
between
space
you
see
in
removing
things
from
the
beholder
seems
always
to
bring
them
nearer
to
each
other
and
the
most
differing
things
are
classed
under
one
name
by
the
man
who
knows
nothing
about
them
but
what
sort
of
a
rock
was
it
you
were
trying
to
draw
a
conical
rock
that
stands
alone
in
front
of
one
of
the
ridges
that
project
from
the
shore
into
the
water
three
with
long
white
wings
were
flying
about
it
and
the
little
waves
of
the
rising
tide
were
beating
themselves
against
it
and
breaking
in
white
plashes
so
the
rock
stood
between
the
blue
and
white
below
and
the
blue
and
white
above
for
though
there
were
no
clouds
the
birds
gave
the
touches
of
white
to
the
upper
now
dora
i
said
i
don
t
know
if
you
are
old
enough
to
understand
me
but
sometimes
little
people
are
long
in
understanding
just
because
the
older
people
think
they
can
t
and
don
t
try
do
you
see
dora
why
i
want
you
to
learn
to
draw
look
how
wynnie
sees
things
that
is
in
a
great
measure
because
she
draws
things
and
has
by
that
learned
to
watch
in
order
to
find
out
it
is
a
great
thing
to
have
your
eyes
dora
s
eyes
were
large
and
she
opened
them
to
their
full
width
as
if
she
would
take
in
the
universe
at
their
little
doors
whether
that
indicated
that
she
did
not
in
the
least
understand
what
i
had
been
saying
or
that
she
was
in
sympathy
with
it
i
can
not
tell
now
let
us
go
up
to
connie
and
tell
her
about
the
rock
and
everything
else
you
have
seen
since
you
went
out
we
are
all
her
messengers
sent
out
to
discover
things
and
bring
back
news
of
after
a
little
talk
with
connie
i
retired
to
the
study
which
was
on
the
same
floor
as
her
room
completing
indeed
the
whole
of
that
part
of
the
house
which
seen
from
without
looked
like
a
separate
building
for
it
had
a
roof
of
its
own
and
stood
higher
up
the
rock
than
the
rest
of
the
dwelling
here
i
began
to
glance
over
the
books
to
have
the
run
of
another
man
s
library
especially
if
it
has
all
been
gathered
by
himself
is
like
having
a
into
the
chambers
of
his
thought
only
one
must
be
wary
when
he
opens
them
what
marks
on
the
books
he
takes
for
those
of
the
present
owner
a
mistake
here
would
breed
considerable
confusion
and
falsehood
in
any
judgment
formed
from
the
library
i
found
however
one
thing
plain
enough
that
shepherd
had
kept
up
that
love
for
an
older
english
literature
which
had
been
one
of
the
cords
to
draw
us
towards
each
other
when
we
were
students
together
there
had
been
one
point
on
which
we
especially
agreed
that
a
true
knowledge
of
the
present
in
literature
as
in
everything
else
could
only
be
founded
upon
a
knowledge
of
what
had
gone
before
therefore
that
any
judgment
in
regard
to
the
literature
of
the
present
day
was
of
no
value
which
was
not
guided
and
influenced
by
a
real
acquaintance
with
the
best
of
what
had
gone
before
being
liable
to
be
dazzled
and
misled
by
novelty
of
form
and
other
qualities
which
whatever
might
be
the
real
worth
of
the
substance
were
in
themselves
purely
ephemeral
i
had
taken
down
a
edition
of
the
poems
of
the
brothers
fletcher
and
having
begun
to
read
a
lovely
passage
in
christ
s
victory
and
triumph
had
gone
into
what
i
can
only
call
an
intellectual
rage
at
the
impudence
of
the
editor
who
had
altered
innumerable
words
and
phrases
to
suit
the
degenerate
taste
of
his
own
time
when
a
knock
came
to
the
door
and
charlie
entered
breathless
with
eagerness
there
s
the
boat
with
the
men
with
the
swords
in
it
and
another
boat
behind
them
twice
as
i
hurried
out
upon
the
road
and
there
close
under
our
windows
were
the
two
boats
we
had
seen
in
the
morning
landing
their
crews
on
the
little
beach
the
second
boat
was
full
of
men
in
all
kinds
of
attire
some
in
blue
jerseys
some
in
red
shirts
some
in
ragged
coats
one
man
who
looked
their
superior
was
dressed
in
blue
from
head
to
foot
what
s
the
matter
i
asked
the
officer
of
the
a
sedate
man
vessel
foundered
sir
he
answered
sprung
a
leak
on
sunday
morning
she
was
laden
with
iron
and
in
a
heavy
ground
swell
it
shifted
and
knocked
a
hole
in
her
the
poor
fellows
are
worn
out
with
the
pump
and
rowing
upon
little
or
nothing
to
they
were
trooping
past
us
by
this
time
looking
rather
dismal
though
not
by
any
means
abject
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
them
now
they
ll
be
taken
in
by
the
people
we
ll
get
up
a
little
subscription
for
them
but
they
all
belong
to
the
society
the
sailors
have
for
sending
the
shipwrecked
to
their
homes
or
where
they
want
to
well
here
s
something
to
help
i
said
thank
you
sir
they
ll
be
very
glad
of
and
if
there
s
anything
wanted
that
i
can
do
for
them
you
must
let
me
i
will
sir
but
i
don
t
think
there
will
be
any
occasion
to
trouble
you
you
are
our
new
clergyman
i
not
exactly
that
only
for
a
little
while
till
my
friend
shepherd
is
able
to
come
back
to
we
don
t
want
to
lose
shepherd
sir
he
s
what
they
call
high
in
these
parts
but
he
s
a
great
favourite
with
all
the
poor
people
because
you
see
he
understands
them
as
if
he
was
of
the
same
flesh
and
blood
with
themselves
as
for
that
matter
i
suppose
we
all
if
we
weren
t
there
would
be
nothing
to
say
at
all
will
any
of
these
men
be
at
church
do
you
suppose
i
am
afraid
sailors
are
not
much
in
the
way
of
going
to
church
i
am
afraid
not
you
see
they
are
all
anxious
to
get
home
most
likely
they
ll
be
all
travelling
it
s
a
pity
it
would
be
a
good
chance
for
saying
something
to
them
that
they
might
think
of
again
but
i
often
think
that
perhaps
it
s
only
my
own
fancy
and
i
don
t
set
it
up
for
anything
that
sailors
won
t
be
judged
exactly
like
other
people
they
re
so
knocked
about
you
see
of
course
not
nobody
will
be
judged
like
any
other
body
to
his
own
master
who
knows
all
about
him
every
man
stands
or
falls
depend
upon
it
god
likes
fair
play
to
use
a
homely
phrase
far
better
than
any
sailor
of
them
all
but
that
s
not
exactly
the
question
it
seems
to
me
the
question
is
this
shall
we
who
know
what
a
blessed
thing
life
is
because
we
know
what
god
is
like
who
can
trust
in
him
with
all
our
hearts
because
he
is
the
father
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
the
friend
of
sinners
shall
we
not
try
all
we
can
to
let
them
too
know
the
blessedness
of
trusting
in
their
father
in
heaven
if
we
could
only
get
them
to
say
the
lord
s
prayer
it
think
what
that
would
be
look
here
this
can
t
be
called
bribery
for
they
are
in
want
of
it
and
it
will
show
them
i
am
friendly
here
s
another
sovereign
give
them
my
compliments
and
say
that
if
any
of
them
happen
to
be
in
kilkhaven
tomorrow
i
shall
be
quite
pleased
to
welcome
them
to
church
tell
them
i
will
give
them
of
my
best
there
if
they
will
come
make
the
invitation
merrily
you
know
no
long
faces
and
solemn
speech
i
will
give
them
the
solemn
speech
when
they
come
to
church
but
even
there
i
hope
god
will
keep
the
long
face
far
from
me
that
is
fittest
for
fear
and
suffering
and
the
house
of
god
is
the
casket
that
holds
the
antidote
against
all
fear
and
most
suffering
but
i
am
preaching
my
sermon
on
saturday
instead
of
sunday
and
keeping
you
from
your
ministration
to
the
poor
fellows
i
will
give
them
your
message
as
near
as
i
can
he
said
and
we
shook
hands
and
parted
this
was
the
first
experience
we
had
of
the
might
and
battle
of
the
ocean
to
our
eyes
it
lay
quiet
as
a
baby
asleep
on
that
sunday
morning
there
had
been
no
commotion
here
yet
now
at
last
on
the
saturday
morning
home
come
the
conquered
and
spoiled
of
the
sea
as
if
with
a
mock
she
takes
all
they
have
and
flings
them
on
shore
again
with
her
weeds
and
her
shells
and
her
sand
before
the
winter
was
over
we
had
learned
how
much
more
of
that
awful
power
that
surrounds
the
habitable
earth
by
slow
degrees
the
sense
of
its
might
grew
upon
us
first
by
the
vision
of
its
many
aspects
and
moods
and
then
by
more
awful
things
that
followed
for
there
are
few
coasts
upon
which
the
sea
rages
so
wildly
as
upon
this
the
whole
force
of
the
atlantic
breaking
upon
it
even
when
there
is
no
storm
within
perhaps
hundreds
of
miles
when
all
is
still
as
a
church
on
the
land
the
storm
that
raves
somewhere
out
upon
the
vast
waste
will
drive
the
waves
in
upon
the
shore
with
such
fury
that
not
even
a
lifeboat
could
make
its
way
through
their
yawning
hollows
and
their
fierce
shattered
and
tumbling
crests
chapter
xvii
my
first
sermon
in
the
seaboard
parish
in
the
hope
that
some
of
the
shipwrecked
mariners
might
be
present
in
the
church
the
next
day
i
proceeded
to
consider
my
morning
s
sermon
for
the
occasion
there
was
no
difficulty
in
taking
care
at
the
same
time
that
it
should
be
suitable
to
the
congregation
whether
those
sailors
were
there
or
not
i
turned
over
in
my
mind
several
subjects
i
thought
for
instance
of
showing
them
how
this
ocean
that
lay
watchful
and
ready
all
about
our
island
all
about
the
earth
was
but
a
visible
type
or
symbol
of
two
other
oceans
one
very
still
the
other
very
awful
and
fierce
in
fact
that
three
oceans
surrounded
us
one
of
the
known
world
one
of
the
unseen
world
that
is
of
death
one
of
the
spirit
the
devouring
ocean
of
evil
and
might
i
not
have
added
yet
another
encompassing
and
silencing
all
the
rest
that
of
truth
the
visible
ocean
seemed
to
make
war
upon
the
land
and
the
dwellers
thereon
restrained
by
the
will
of
god
and
by
him
made
subject
more
and
more
to
the
advancing
knowledge
of
those
who
were
created
to
rule
over
it
it
was
yet
like
a
beast
ever
ready
to
break
loose
and
devour
its
masters
of
course
this
would
have
been
but
one
aspect
or
appearance
of
it
for
it
was
in
truth
all
service
but
this
was
the
aspect
i
knew
it
must
bear
to
those
seafaring
themselves
or
not
to
whom
i
had
to
speak
then
i
thought
i
might
show
that
its
power
like
that
of
all
things
that
man
is
ready
to
fear
had
one
barrier
over
which
no
commotion
no
might
of
driving
wind
could
carry
it
beyond
which
its
loudest
waves
were
dumb
the
barrier
of
death
hitherto
and
no
further
could
its
power
reach
it
could
kill
the
body
it
could
dash
in
pieces
the
last
little
to
which
the
man
clung
but
thus
it
swept
the
man
beyond
its
own
region
into
the
second
sea
of
stillness
which
we
call
death
out
upon
which
the
thoughts
of
those
that
are
left
behind
can
follow
him
only
in
great
longings
vague
conjectures
and
mighty
faith
then
i
thought
i
could
show
them
how
raving
in
fear
or
lying
still
in
calm
deceit
there
lay
about
the
life
of
man
a
far
more
fearful
ocean
than
that
which
threatened
his
body
for
this
would
cast
could
it
but
get
a
hold
of
him
both
body
and
soul
into
hell
the
sea
of
evil
of
vice
of
sin
of
they
might
call
it
by
what
name
they
pleased
this
made
war
against
the
very
essence
of
life
against
god
who
is
the
truth
against
love
against
fairness
against
fatherhood
motherhood
sisterhood
brotherhood
manhood
womanhood
against
tenderness
and
grace
and
beauty
gathering
into
one
pulp
of
festering
death
all
that
is
noble
lovely
worshipful
in
the
human
nature
made
so
divine
that
the
one
fearless
man
the
lord
jesus
christ
shared
it
with
us
this
i
thought
i
might
make
them
understand
was
the
only
terrible
sea
the
only
hopeless
ocean
from
whose
awful
shore
we
must
shrink
and
flee
the
end
of
every
voyage
upon
whose
bosom
was
the
bottom
of
its
filthy
waters
beyond
the
reach
of
all
that
is
thought
or
spoken
in
the
light
beyond
life
itself
but
for
the
hand
that
reaches
down
from
the
upper
ocean
of
truth
the
hand
of
the
redeemer
of
men
i
thought
i
say
for
a
while
that
i
could
make
this
not
definite
but
very
real
to
them
but
i
did
not
feel
quite
confident
about
it
might
they
not
in
the
symbolism
forget
the
thing
symbolised
and
would
not
the
symbol
itself
be
ready
to
fade
quite
from
their
memory
or
to
return
only
in
the
vaguest
shadow
and
with
the
thought
i
perceived
a
far
more
excellent
way
for
the
power
of
the
truth
lies
of
course
in
its
revelation
to
the
mind
and
while
for
this
there
are
a
thousand
means
none
are
so
mighty
as
its
embodiment
in
human
beings
and
human
life
there
it
is
itself
alive
and
active
and
amongst
these
what
embodiment
comes
near
to
that
in
him
who
was
perfect
man
in
virtue
of
being
at
the
root
of
the
secret
of
humanity
in
virtue
of
being
the
eternal
son
of
god
we
are
his
sons
in
time
he
is
his
son
in
eternity
of
whose
sea
time
is
but
the
broken
sparkle
therefore
i
would
talk
to
them
about
but
i
will
treat
my
reader
now
as
if
he
were
not
my
reader
but
one
of
my
congregation
on
that
bright
sunday
my
first
in
the
seaboard
parish
with
the
sea
outside
the
church
flashing
in
the
sunlight
while
i
stood
at
the
lectern
which
was
in
front
of
the
i
could
see
little
of
my
congregation
partly
from
my
being
on
a
level
with
them
partly
from
the
necessity
for
keeping
my
eyes
and
thoughts
upon
that
which
i
read
when
however
i
rose
from
prayer
in
the
pulpit
then
i
felt
as
usual
with
me
that
i
was
personally
present
for
personal
influence
with
my
people
and
then
i
saw
to
my
great
pleasure
that
one
long
bench
nearly
in
the
middle
of
the
church
was
full
of
such
sunburnt
men
as
could
not
be
mistaken
for
any
but
mariners
even
if
their
torn
and
worn
garments
had
not
revealed
that
they
must
be
the
very
men
about
whom
we
had
been
so
much
interested
not
only
were
they
behaving
with
perfect
decorum
but
their
rough
faces
wore
an
aspect
of
solemnity
which
i
do
not
suppose
was
by
any
means
their
usual
aspect
i
gave
them
no
text
i
had
one
myself
which
was
the
necessary
thing
they
should
have
it
by
and
by
once
upon
a
time
i
said
a
man
went
up
a
mountain
and
stayed
there
till
it
was
dark
and
stayed
on
now
a
man
who
finds
himself
on
a
mountain
as
the
sun
is
going
down
especially
if
he
is
alone
makes
haste
to
get
down
before
it
is
dark
but
this
man
went
up
when
the
sun
was
going
down
and
as
i
say
continued
there
for
a
good
long
while
after
it
was
dark
you
will
want
to
know
why
i
will
tell
you
he
wished
to
be
alone
he
hadn
t
a
house
of
his
own
he
never
had
all
the
time
he
lived
he
hadn
t
even
a
room
of
his
own
into
which
he
could
go
and
bolt
the
door
of
it
true
he
had
kind
friends
who
gave
him
a
bed
but
they
were
all
poor
people
and
their
houses
were
small
and
very
likely
they
had
large
families
and
he
could
not
always
find
a
quiet
place
to
go
into
and
i
dare
say
if
he
had
had
a
room
he
would
have
been
a
little
troubled
with
the
children
constantly
coming
to
find
him
for
however
much
he
loved
them
and
no
man
was
ever
so
fond
of
children
as
he
was
he
needed
to
be
left
quiet
sometimes
so
upon
this
occasion
he
went
up
the
mountain
just
to
be
quiet
he
had
been
all
day
with
a
crowd
of
people
and
he
felt
that
it
was
time
to
be
alone
for
he
had
been
talking
with
men
all
day
which
tires
and
sometimes
confuses
a
man
s
thoughts
and
now
he
wanted
to
talk
with
god
for
that
makes
a
man
strong
and
puts
all
the
confusion
in
order
again
and
lets
a
man
know
what
he
is
about
so
he
went
to
the
top
of
the
hill
that
was
his
secret
chamber
it
had
no
door
but
that
did
not
matter
no
one
could
see
him
but
god
there
he
stayed
for
hours
sometimes
i
suppose
kneeling
in
his
prayer
to
god
sometimes
sitting
tired
with
his
own
thinking
on
a
stone
sometimes
walking
about
looking
forward
to
what
would
come
next
not
anxious
about
it
but
contemplating
it
for
just
before
he
came
up
here
some
of
the
people
who
had
been
with
him
wanted
to
make
him
a
king
and
this
would
not
do
this
was
not
what
god
wanted
of
him
and
therefore
he
got
rid
of
them
and
came
up
here
to
talk
to
god
it
was
so
quiet
up
here
the
earth
had
almost
vanished
he
could
see
just
the
bare
hilltop
beneath
him
a
glimmer
below
and
the
sky
and
the
stars
over
his
head
the
people
had
all
gone
away
to
their
own
homes
and
perhaps
next
day
would
hardly
think
about
him
at
all
busy
catching
fish
or
digging
their
gardens
or
making
things
for
their
houses
but
he
knew
that
god
would
not
forget
him
the
next
day
any
more
than
this
day
and
that
god
had
sent
him
not
to
be
the
king
that
these
people
wanted
him
to
be
but
their
servant
so
to
make
his
heart
strong
i
say
he
went
up
into
the
mountain
alone
to
have
a
talk
with
his
father
how
quiet
it
all
was
up
here
i
say
and
how
noisy
it
had
been
down
there
a
little
while
ago
but
god
had
been
in
the
noise
then
as
much
as
he
was
in
the
quiet
now
the
only
difference
being
that
he
could
not
then
be
alone
with
him
i
need
not
tell
you
who
this
man
was
it
was
the
king
of
men
the
servant
of
men
the
lord
jesus
christ
the
everlasting
son
of
our
father
in
heaven
now
this
mountain
on
which
he
was
praying
had
a
small
lake
at
the
foot
of
it
that
is
about
thirteen
miles
long
and
five
miles
broad
not
wanting
even
his
usual
companions
to
be
with
him
this
evening
partly
i
presume
because
they
were
of
the
same
mind
as
those
who
desired
to
take
him
by
force
and
make
him
a
king
he
had
sent
them
away
in
their
boat
to
go
across
this
water
to
the
other
side
where
were
their
homes
and
their
families
now
it
was
not
pitch
dark
either
on
the
or
on
the
water
down
below
yet
i
doubt
if
any
other
man
than
he
would
have
been
enough
to
discover
that
little
boat
down
in
the
middle
of
the
lake
much
distressed
by
the
west
wind
that
blew
right
in
their
teeth
but
he
loved
every
man
in
it
so
much
that
i
think
even
as
he
was
talking
to
his
father
his
eyes
would
now
and
then
go
looking
for
and
finding
it
watching
it
on
its
way
across
to
the
other
side
you
must
remember
that
it
was
a
little
boat
and
there
are
often
tremendous
storms
upon
these
small
lakes
with
great
mountains
about
them
for
the
wind
will
come
all
at
once
rushing
down
through
the
clefts
in
as
sudden
a
squall
as
ever
overtook
a
sailor
at
sea
and
then
you
know
there
is
no
if
the
wind
get
the
better
of
them
they
are
on
the
shore
in
a
few
minutes
whichever
way
the
wind
may
blow
he
saw
them
worn
out
at
the
oar
toiling
in
rowing
for
the
wind
was
contrary
unto
them
so
the
time
for
loneliness
and
prayer
was
over
and
the
time
to
go
down
out
of
his
secret
chamber
and
help
his
brethren
was
come
he
did
not
need
to
turn
and
say
to
his
father
as
if
he
dwelt
on
that
alone
his
father
was
down
there
on
the
lake
as
well
he
went
straight
down
could
not
his
father
if
he
too
was
down
on
the
lake
help
them
without
him
yes
but
he
wanted
him
to
do
it
that
they
might
see
that
he
did
it
otherwise
they
would
only
have
thought
that
the
wind
fell
and
the
waves
lay
down
without
supposing
for
a
moment
that
their
master
or
his
father
had
had
anything
to
do
with
it
they
would
have
done
just
as
people
do
they
think
that
the
help
comes
of
itself
instead
of
by
the
will
of
him
who
determined
from
the
first
that
men
should
be
helped
so
the
master
went
down
the
hill
when
he
reached
the
border
of
the
lake
the
wind
being
from
the
other
side
he
must
have
found
the
waves
breaking
furiously
upon
the
rocks
but
that
made
no
difference
to
him
he
looked
out
as
he
stood
alone
on
the
edge
amidst
the
rushing
wind
and
the
noise
of
the
water
out
over
the
waves
under
the
clear
starry
sky
saw
where
the
tiny
boat
was
tossed
about
like
a
nutshell
and
set
the
mariners
had
been
staring
at
me
up
to
this
point
leaning
forward
on
their
benches
for
sailors
are
nearly
as
fond
of
a
good
yarn
as
they
are
of
tobacco
and
i
heard
afterwards
that
they
had
voted
parson
s
yarn
a
good
one
now
however
i
saw
one
of
them
probably
more
ignorant
than
the
others
cast
a
questioning
glance
at
his
neighbour
it
was
not
returned
and
he
fell
again
into
a
listening
attitude
he
had
no
idea
of
what
was
coming
he
probably
thought
parson
had
forgotten
to
say
how
jesus
had
come
by
a
boat
the
companions
of
our
lord
had
not
been
willing
to
go
away
and
leave
him
behind
now
i
dare
say
they
wished
more
than
ever
that
he
had
been
with
them
not
that
they
thought
he
could
do
anything
with
a
storm
only
that
somehow
they
would
have
been
less
afraid
with
his
face
to
look
at
they
had
seen
him
cure
men
of
dreadful
diseases
they
had
seen
him
turn
water
into
wine
some
of
them
they
had
seen
him
feed
five
thousand
people
the
day
before
with
five
loaves
and
two
small
fishes
but
had
one
of
their
number
suggested
that
if
he
had
been
with
them
they
would
have
been
safe
from
the
storm
they
would
not
have
talked
any
nonsense
about
the
laws
of
nature
not
having
learned
that
kind
of
nonsense
but
they
would
have
said
that
was
quite
a
different
thing
altogether
too
much
to
expect
or
believe
could
make
the
wind
mind
what
it
was
about
or
keep
the
water
from
drowning
you
if
you
fell
into
it
and
couldn
t
swim
or
at
length
when
they
were
nearly
worn
out
taking
feebler
and
feebler
strokes
sometimes
missing
the
water
altogether
at
other
times
burying
their
oars
in
it
up
to
the
handles
as
they
rose
on
the
crest
of
a
huge
wave
one
of
them
gave
a
cry
and
they
all
stopped
rowing
and
stared
leaning
forward
to
peer
through
the
darkness
and
through
the
spray
which
the
wind
tore
from
the
tops
of
the
waves
and
scattered
before
it
like
dust
they
saw
perhaps
a
hundred
yards
or
so
from
the
boat
something
standing
up
from
the
surface
of
the
water
it
seemed
to
move
towards
them
it
was
a
shape
like
a
man
they
all
cried
out
with
fear
as
was
natural
for
they
thought
it
must
be
a
how
the
faces
of
the
sailors
strained
towards
me
at
this
part
of
the
story
i
was
afraid
one
of
them
especially
was
on
the
point
of
getting
up
to
speak
as
we
have
heard
of
sailors
doing
in
church
i
went
on
but
then
over
the
noise
of
the
wind
and
the
waters
came
the
voice
they
knew
so
well
it
said
be
of
good
cheer
it
is
i
be
not
i
should
think
between
wonder
and
gladness
they
hardly
knew
for
some
moments
where
they
were
or
what
they
were
about
peter
was
the
first
to
recover
himself
apparently
in
the
first
flush
of
his
delight
he
felt
strong
and
full
of
courage
lord
if
it
be
thou
he
said
bid
me
come
unto
thee
on
the
jesus
just
said
come
and
peter
unshipped
his
oar
and
scrambled
over
the
gunwale
on
to
the
sea
but
when
he
let
go
his
hold
of
the
boat
and
began
to
look
about
him
and
saw
how
the
wind
was
tearing
the
water
and
how
it
tossed
and
raved
between
him
and
jesus
he
began
to
be
afraid
and
as
soon
as
he
began
to
be
afraid
he
began
to
sink
but
he
had
notwithstanding
his
fear
just
sense
enough
to
do
the
one
sensible
thing
he
cried
out
lord
save
and
jesus
put
out
his
hand
and
took
hold
of
him
and
lifted
him
up
out
of
the
water
and
said
to
him
o
thou
of
little
faith
wherefore
didst
thou
doubt
and
then
they
got
into
the
boat
and
the
wind
fell
all
at
once
and
altogether
now
you
will
not
think
that
peter
was
a
coward
will
you
it
wasn
t
that
he
hadn
t
courage
but
that
he
hadn
t
enough
of
it
and
why
was
it
that
he
hadn
t
enough
of
it
because
he
hadn
t
faith
enough
peter
was
always
very
easily
impressed
with
the
look
of
things
it
wasn
t
at
all
likely
that
a
man
should
be
able
to
walk
on
the
water
and
yet
peter
found
himself
standing
on
the
water
you
would
have
thought
that
when
once
he
found
himself
standing
on
the
water
he
need
not
be
afraid
of
the
wind
and
the
waves
that
lay
between
him
and
jesus
but
they
looked
so
ugly
that
the
fearfulness
of
them
took
hold
of
his
heart
and
his
courage
went
you
would
have
thought
that
the
greatest
trial
of
his
courage
was
over
when
he
got
out
of
the
boat
and
that
there
was
comparatively
little
more
ahead
of
him
yet
the
sight
of
the
waves
and
the
blast
of
the
boisterous
wind
were
too
much
for
him
i
will
tell
you
how
i
fancy
it
was
and
i
think
there
are
several
instances
of
the
same
kind
of
thing
in
peter
s
life
when
he
got
out
of
the
boat
and
found
himself
standing
on
the
water
he
began
to
think
much
of
himself
for
being
able
to
do
so
and
fancy
himself
better
and
greater
than
his
companions
and
an
especial
favourite
of
god
above
them
now
there
is
nothing
that
kills
faith
sooner
than
pride
the
two
are
directly
against
each
other
the
moment
that
peter
grew
proud
and
began
to
think
about
himself
instead
of
about
his
master
he
began
to
lose
his
faith
and
then
he
grew
afraid
and
then
he
began
to
sink
and
that
brought
him
to
his
senses
then
he
forgot
himself
and
remembered
his
master
and
then
the
hand
of
the
lord
caught
him
and
the
voice
of
the
lord
gently
rebuked
him
for
the
smallness
of
his
faith
asking
wherefore
didst
thou
doubt
i
wonder
if
peter
was
able
to
read
his
own
heart
sufficiently
well
to
answer
that
i
do
not
think
it
likely
at
this
period
of
his
history
but
god
has
immeasurable
patience
and
before
he
had
done
teaching
peter
even
in
this
life
he
had
made
him
know
quite
well
that
pride
and
conceit
were
at
the
root
of
all
his
failures
jesus
did
not
point
it
out
to
him
now
faith
was
the
only
thing
that
would
reveal
that
to
him
as
well
as
cure
him
of
it
and
was
therefore
the
only
thing
he
required
of
him
in
his
rebuke
i
suspect
peter
was
helped
back
into
the
boat
by
the
eager
hands
of
his
companions
already
in
a
humbler
state
of
mind
than
when
he
left
it
but
before
his
pride
would
be
quite
overcome
it
would
need
that
same
voice
of
to
call
him
satan
and
the
voice
of
the
cock
to
bring
to
his
mind
his
loud
boast
and
his
sneaking
denial
nay
even
the
voice
of
one
who
had
never
seen
the
lord
till
after
his
death
but
was
yet
a
readier
disciple
than
he
the
voice
of
paul
to
rebuke
him
because
he
dissembled
and
was
not
downright
honest
but
at
the
last
even
he
gained
the
crown
of
martyrdom
enduring
all
extremes
nailed
to
the
cross
like
his
master
rather
than
deny
his
name
this
should
teach
us
to
distrust
ourselves
and
yet
have
great
hope
for
ourselves
and
endless
patience
with
other
people
but
to
return
to
the
story
and
what
the
story
itself
teaches
us
if
the
disciples
had
known
that
jesus
saw
them
from
the
top
of
the
mountain
and
was
watching
them
all
the
time
would
they
have
been
frightened
at
the
storm
as
i
have
little
doubt
they
were
for
they
were
only
fishermen
you
know
well
to
answer
my
own
question
i
went
on
in
haste
for
i
saw
one
or
two
of
the
sailors
with
an
audible
answer
hovering
on
their
lips
i
don
t
know
that
as
they
then
were
it
would
have
made
so
much
difference
to
them
for
none
of
them
had
risen
much
above
the
look
of
the
things
nearest
them
yet
but
supposing
you
who
know
something
about
him
were
alone
on
the
sea
and
expecting
your
boat
to
be
swamped
every
moment
if
you
found
out
all
at
once
that
he
was
looking
down
at
you
from
some
lofty
hilltop
and
seeing
all
round
about
you
in
time
and
space
too
would
you
be
afraid
he
might
mean
you
to
go
to
the
bottom
you
know
would
you
mind
going
to
the
bottom
with
him
looking
at
you
i
do
not
think
i
should
mind
it
myself
but
i
must
take
care
lest
i
be
boastful
like
peter
why
should
we
be
afraid
of
anything
with
him
looking
at
us
who
is
the
saviour
of
men
but
we
are
afraid
of
him
instead
because
we
do
not
believe
that
he
is
what
he
says
he
is
the
saviour
of
men
we
do
not
believe
what
he
offers
us
is
salvation
we
think
it
is
slavery
and
therefore
continue
slaves
friends
i
will
speak
to
you
who
think
you
do
believe
in
him
i
am
not
going
to
say
that
you
do
not
believe
in
him
but
i
hope
i
am
going
to
make
you
say
to
yourselves
that
you
too
deserve
to
have
those
words
of
the
saviour
spoken
to
you
that
were
spoken
to
peter
o
ye
of
little
faith
floating
on
the
sea
of
your
troubles
all
kinds
of
fears
and
anxieties
assailing
you
is
he
not
on
the
sees
he
not
the
little
boat
of
your
fortunes
tossed
with
the
waves
and
the
contrary
wind
assuredly
he
will
come
to
you
walking
on
the
waters
it
may
not
be
in
the
way
you
wish
but
if
not
you
will
say
at
last
this
is
it
may
be
that
he
will
come
in
a
form
that
will
make
you
cry
out
for
fear
in
the
weakness
of
your
faith
as
the
disciples
cried
out
not
believing
any
more
than
they
did
that
it
can
be
he
but
will
not
each
of
you
arouse
his
courage
that
to
you
also
he
may
say
as
to
the
woman
with
the
sick
daughter
whose
confidence
he
so
sorely
tried
great
is
thy
faith
will
you
not
rouse
yourself
i
say
that
you
may
do
him
justice
and
cast
off
the
slavery
of
your
own
dread
o
ye
of
little
faith
wherefore
will
ye
doubt
do
not
think
that
the
lord
sees
and
will
not
come
down
the
mountain
assuredly
he
will
come
and
you
are
now
as
safe
in
your
troubles
as
the
disciples
were
in
theirs
with
jesus
looking
on
they
did
not
know
it
but
it
was
so
the
lord
was
watching
them
and
when
you
look
back
upon
your
past
lives
can
not
you
see
some
instances
of
the
same
kind
when
you
felt
and
acted
as
if
the
lord
had
forgotten
you
and
found
afterwards
that
he
had
been
watching
you
all
the
time
but
the
reason
why
you
do
not
trust
him
more
is
that
you
obey
him
so
little
if
you
would
only
ask
what
god
would
have
you
to
do
you
would
soon
find
your
confidence
growing
it
is
because
you
are
proud
and
envious
and
greedy
after
gain
that
you
do
not
trust
him
more
ah
trust
him
if
it
were
only
to
get
rid
of
these
evil
things
and
be
clean
and
beautiful
in
heart
o
sailors
with
me
on
the
ocean
of
life
will
you
knowing
that
he
is
watching
you
from
his
do
and
say
the
things
that
hurt
and
wrong
and
disappoint
him
sailors
on
the
waters
that
surround
this
globe
though
there
be
no
great
mountain
that
overlooks
the
little
lake
on
which
you
float
not
the
less
does
he
behold
you
and
care
for
you
and
watch
over
you
will
you
do
that
which
is
unpleasing
distressful
to
him
will
you
be
irreverent
cruel
coarse
will
you
say
evil
things
lie
and
delight
in
vile
stories
and
reports
with
his
eye
on
you
watching
your
ship
on
its
watery
ways
ever
ready
to
come
over
the
waves
to
help
you
it
is
a
fine
thing
sailors
to
fear
nothing
but
it
would
be
far
finer
to
fear
nothing
he
is
above
all
and
over
all
and
in
you
all
for
his
sake
and
for
his
love
give
up
everything
bad
and
take
him
for
your
captain
he
will
be
both
captain
and
pilot
to
you
and
steer
you
safe
into
the
port
of
glory
now

god

another
sunday
evening
in
the
evening
we
met
in
connie
s
room
as
usual
to
have
our
talk
and
this
is
what
came
out
of
it
the
window
was
open
the
sun
was
in
the
west
we
sat
a
little
aside
out
of
the
course
of
his
radiance
and
let
him
look
full
into
the
room
only
wynnie
sat
back
in
a
dark
corner
as
if
she
would
get
out
of
his
way
below
him
the
sea
lay
bluer
than
you
could
believe
even
when
you
saw
it
blue
with
a
delicate
yet
deep
silky
blue
the
exquisiteness
of
which
was
thrown
up
by
the
brilliant
white
lines
of
its
lapping
on
the
high
coast
to
the
northward
we
had
just
sat
down
when
dora
broke
out
with
i
saw
niceboots
at
church
he
did
stare
at
you
papa
as
if
he
had
never
heard
a
sermon
i
daresay
he
never
heard
such
a
sermon
before
said
connie
with
the
perfect
confidence
of
inexperience
and
partiality
not
to
say
ignorance
seeing
she
had
not
heard
the
sermon
herself
here
wynnie
spoke
from
her
dark
corner
apparently
forcing
herself
to
speak
and
thereby
giving
what
seemed
an
unpleasant
tone
to
what
she
said
well
papa
i
don
t
know
what
to
think
you
are
always
telling
us
to
trust
in
him
but
how
can
we
if
we
are
not
good
the
first
good
thing
you
can
do
is
to
look
up
to
him
that
is
the
beginning
of
trust
in
him
and
the
most
sensible
thing
that
it
is
possible
for
us
to
do
that
is
but
it
s
no
use
how
do
you
know
that
because
you
i
mean
i
can
t
feel
good
or
care
about
it
at
but
is
that
any
ground
for
saying
that
it
is
no
use
that
he
does
not
heed
you
that
he
disregards
the
look
cast
up
to
him
that
till
the
heart
goes
with
the
will
he
who
made
himself
strong
to
be
the
helper
of
the
weak
who
pities
most
those
who
are
most
destitute
and
who
so
destitute
as
those
who
do
not
love
what
they
want
to
love
except
indeed
those
who
don
t
want
to
love
that
till
you
are
well
on
towards
all
right
by
earnestly
seeking
it
he
won
t
help
you
you
are
to
judge
him
from
yourself
are
you
forgetting
that
all
the
misery
in
you
is
just
because
you
have
not
got
his
grand
presence
with
you
i
spoke
so
earnestly
as
to
be
somewhat
incoherent
in
words
but
my
reader
will
understand
wynnie
was
silent
connie
as
if
partly
to
help
her
sister
followed
on
the
same
side
i
don
t
know
exactly
how
to
say
what
i
mean
papa
but
i
wish
i
could
get
this
lovely
afternoon
all
full
of
sunshine
and
blue
into
unity
with
all
that
you
teach
us
about
jesus
christ
i
wish
this
beautiful
day
came
in
with
my
thought
of
him
like
the
frame
gold
and
red
and
blue
that
you
have
to
that
picture
of
him
at
home
why
doesn
t
it
just
because
you
have
not
enough
of
faith
in
him
my
dear
you
do
not
know
him
well
enough
yet
you
do
not
yet
believe
that
he
means
you
all
gladness
heartily
honestly
and
no
suffering
papa
i
did
not
say
that
my
dear
there
you
are
on
your
couch
and
can
t
move
but
he
does
mean
you
such
gladness
such
a
full
sunny
air
and
blue
sea
of
blessedness
that
this
suffering
shall
count
for
little
in
it
nay
more
shall
be
taken
in
for
part
and
like
the
rocks
that
interfere
with
the
roll
of
the
sea
flash
out
the
white
that
glorifies
and
intensifies
the
whole
to
pass
away
by
and
by
i
trust
none
the
less
what
a
chance
you
have
my
connie
of
believing
in
him
of
offering
upon
his
altar
but
said
my
wife
are
not
these
feelings
in
a
great
measure
dependent
upon
the
state
of
one
s
health
i
find
it
so
different
when
the
sunshine
is
inside
me
as
well
as
outside
not
a
doubt
of
it
my
dear
but
that
is
only
the
more
reason
for
rising
above
all
that
from
the
way
some
people
speak
of
physical
difficulties
i
don
t
mean
you
wife
you
would
think
that
they
were
not
merely
the
inevitable
which
they
are
but
the
insurmountable
which
they
are
not
that
they
are
physical
and
not
spiritual
is
not
only
a
great
consolation
but
a
strong
argument
for
overcoming
them
for
all
that
is
physical
is
put
or
is
in
the
process
of
being
put
under
the
feet
of
the
spiritual
do
not
mistake
me
i
do
not
say
you
can
make
yourself
feel
merry
or
happy
when
you
are
in
a
physical
condition
which
is
contrary
to
such
mental
condition
but
you
can
withdraw
from
it
not
all
at
once
but
by
practice
and
effort
you
can
learn
to
withdraw
from
it
refusing
to
allow
your
judgments
and
actions
to
be
ruled
by
it
you
can
climb
up
out
of
the
fogs
and
sit
quiet
in
the
sunlight
on
the
hillside
of
faith
you
can
not
be
merry
down
below
in
the
fog
for
there
is
the
fog
but
you
can
every
now
and
then
fly
with
the
of
the
soul
up
into
the
clear
to
remind
yourself
that
all
this
passes
away
is
but
an
accident
and
that
the
sun
shines
always
although
it
may
not
at
any
given
moment
be
shining
on
you
what
does
that
matter
you
will
learn
to
say
it
is
enough
for
me
to
know
that
the
sun
does
shine
and
that
this
is
only
a
weary
fog
that
is
round
about
me
for
the
moment
i
shall
come
out
into
the
light
beyond
this
is
faith
faith
in
god
who
is
the
light
and
is
all
in
all
i
believe
that
the
most
glorious
instances
of
calmness
in
suffering
are
thus
achieved
that
the
sufferers
really
do
not
suffer
what
one
of
us
would
if
thrown
into
their
physical
condition
without
the
refuge
of
their
spiritual
condition
as
well
for
they
have
taken
refuge
in
the
inner
chamber
out
of
the
spring
of
their
life
a
power
goes
forth
that
quenches
the
flames
of
the
furnace
of
their
suffering
so
far
at
least
that
it
does
not
touch
the
deep
life
can
not
make
them
miserable
does
not
drive
them
from
the
possession
of
their
soul
in
patience
which
is
the
divine
citadel
of
the
suffering
do
you
understand
me
connie
i
do
papa
i
think
still
less
then
is
the
fact
that
the
difficulty
is
physical
to
be
used
as
an
excuse
for
giving
way
to
and
in
fact
leaving
ourselves
to
be
tossed
and
shaken
by
every
tremble
of
our
nerves
that
is
as
if
a
man
should
give
himself
into
the
hands
and
will
and
caprice
of
an
to
work
upon
him
not
with
the
music
of
the
spheres
but
with
the
wretched
growling
of
the
but
said
wynnie
i
have
heard
you
yourself
papa
make
excuse
for
people
s
on
this
very
ground
that
they
were
out
of
health
indeed
she
went
on
i
have
heard
you
do
so
for
myself
when
you
did
not
know
that
i
was
within
yes
my
dear
most
assuredly
it
is
no
fiction
but
a
real
difference
that
lies
between
excusing
ourselves
and
excusing
other
people
no
doubt
the
same
excuse
is
just
for
ourselves
that
is
just
for
other
people
but
we
can
do
something
to
put
ourselves
right
upon
a
higher
principle
and
therefore
we
should
not
waste
our
time
in
excusing
or
even
in
condemning
ourselves
but
make
haste
up
the
hill
where
we
can
not
work
that
is
in
the
life
of
another
we
have
time
to
make
all
the
excuse
we
can
nay
more
it
is
only
justice
there
we
are
not
bound
to
insist
on
our
own
rights
even
of
excuse
the
wisest
thing
often
is
to
forego
them
but
we
are
bound
by
heaven
earth
and
hell
to
give
them
to
other
people
and
besides
what
a
comfort
to
ourselves
to
be
able
to
say
it
is
true
was
cross
but
it
wasn
t
in
the
least
that
he
wasn
t
friendly
or
didn
t
like
me
it
was
only
that
he
had
eaten
something
that
hadn
t
agreed
with
him
i
could
see
it
in
his
eye
he
had
one
of
his
thus
you
see
justice
to
our
neighbour
and
comfort
to
ourselves
is
one
and
the
same
thing
but
it
would
be
a
sad
thing
to
have
to
think
that
when
we
found
ourselves
in
the
same
ungracious
condition
from
whatever
cause
we
had
only
to
submit
to
it
saying
it
is
a
law
of
nature
as
even
those
who
talk
most
about
laws
will
not
do
when
those
laws
come
between
them
and
their
own
comfort
they
are
ready
enough
then
to
call
in
the
aid
of
higher
laws
which
so
far
from
being
contradictory
overrule
the
lower
to
get
things
into
something
like
habitable
endurable
condition
it
may
be
a
law
of
nature
but
what
has
the
law
of
the
spirit
of
life
to
it
as
the
scotch
lawyers
would
a
little
pause
followed
during
which
i
hope
some
of
us
were
thinking
that
wynnie
at
least
was
her
next
question
made
evident
what
you
say
about
a
law
of
nature
and
a
law
of
the
spirit
makes
me
think
again
how
that
walking
on
the
water
has
always
been
a
puzzle
to
it
could
hardly
be
other
seeing
that
we
can
not
possibly
understand
it
i
answered
but
i
find
it
so
hard
to
believe
can
t
you
say
something
papa
to
help
me
to
believe
it
i
think
if
you
admit
what
goes
before
you
will
find
there
is
nothing
against
reason
in
the
tell
me
please
what
you
if
all
things
were
made
by
jesus
the
word
of
god
would
it
be
reasonable
that
the
water
that
he
had
created
should
be
able
to
drown
him
it
might
drown
his
it
would
if
he
had
not
the
power
over
it
still
to
prevent
it
from
laying
hold
of
him
but
just
think
for
a
moment
god
is
a
spirit
spirit
is
greater
than
matter
spirit
makes
matter
think
what
it
was
for
a
human
body
to
have
such
a
divine
creative
power
dwelling
in
it
as
that
which
dwelt
in
the
human
form
of
jesus
what
power
and
influence
and
utter
rule
that
spirit
must
have
over
the
body
in
which
it
dwells
we
can
not
imagine
how
much
but
if
we
have
so
much
power
over
our
bodies
how
much
more
must
the
pure
divine
jesus
have
had
over
his
i
suspect
this
miracle
was
wrought
not
through
anything
done
to
the
water
but
through
the
power
of
the
spirit
over
the
body
of
jesus
which
was
all
obedient
thereto
i
am
not
explaining
the
miracle
for
that
i
can
not
do
one
day
i
think
it
will
be
plain
common
sense
to
us
but
now
i
am
only
showing
you
what
seems
to
me
to
bring
us
a
step
nearer
to
the
essential
region
of
the
miracle
and
so
far
make
it
easier
to
believe
if
we
look
at
the
history
of
our
lord
we
shall
find
that
true
real
human
body
as
his
was
it
was
yet
used
by
his
spirit
after
a
fashion
in
which
we
can
not
yet
use
our
bodies
and
this
is
only
reasonable
let
me
give
you
an
instance
you
remember
how
on
the
mount
of
transfiguration
that
body
shone
so
that
the
light
of
it
illuminated
all
his
garments
you
do
not
surely
suppose
that
this
shine
was
external
physical
light
as
we
say
no
doubt
it
was
physical
light
for
how
else
would
their
eyes
have
seen
it
but
where
did
it
come
from
what
was
its
source
i
think
it
was
a
natural
outburst
of
glory
from
the
mind
of
jesus
filled
with
the
perfect
life
of
communion
with
his
father
the
light
of
his
divine
blessedness
taking
form
in
physical
radiance
that
permeated
and
glorified
all
that
surrounded
him
as
the
body
is
the
expression
of
the
soul
as
the
face
of
jesus
himself
was
the
expression
of
the
being
the
thought
the
love
of
jesus
in
like
manner
this
radiance
was
the
natural
expression
of
his
gladness
even
in
the
face
of
that
of
which
they
had
been
talking
moses
elias
and
he
namely
the
decease
that
he
should
accomplish
at
jerusalem
again
after
his
resurrection
he
convinced
the
hands
as
well
as
eyes
of
doubting
thomas
that
he
was
indeed
there
in
the
body
and
yet
that
body
could
appear
and
disappear
as
the
lord
willed
all
this
is
full
of
marvel
i
grant
you
but
probably
far
more
intelligible
to
us
in
a
further
state
of
existence
than
some
of
the
most
simple
facts
with
regard
to
our
own
bodies
are
to
us
now
only
that
we
are
so
used
to
them
that
we
never
think
how
unintelligible
they
really
but
then
about
peter
papa
what
you
have
been
saying
will
not
apply
to
peter
s
body
you
i
confess
there
is
more
difficulty
there
but
if
you
can
suppose
that
such
power
were
indwelling
in
jesus
you
can
not
limit
the
sphere
of
its
action
as
he
is
the
head
of
the
body
his
church
in
all
spiritual
things
so
i
firmly
believe
however
little
we
can
understand
about
it
is
he
in
all
natural
things
as
well
peter
s
faith
in
him
brought
even
peter
s
body
within
the
sphere
of
the
outgoing
power
of
the
master
do
you
suppose
that
because
peter
ceased
to
be
brave
and
trusting
therefore
jesus
withdrew
from
him
some
sustaining
power
and
allowed
him
to
sink
i
do
not
believe
it
i
believe
peter
s
sinking
followed
naturally
upon
his
loss
of
confidence
thus
he
fell
away
from
the
life
of
the
master
was
no
longer
in
that
way
i
mean
connected
with
the
head
was
instantly
under
the
dominion
of
the
natural
law
of
gravitation
as
we
call
it
and
began
to
sink
therefore
the
lord
must
take
other
means
to
save
him
he
must
draw
nigh
to
him
in
a
bodily
manner
the
pride
of
peter
had
withdrawn
him
from
the
immediate
spiritual
influence
of
christ
conquering
his
matter
and
therefore
the
lord
must
come
over
the
stormy
space
between
come
nearer
to
him
in
the
body
and
from
his
own
height
of
safety
above
the
sphere
of
the
natural
law
stretch
out
to
him
the
arm
of
physical
aid
lift
him
up
lead
him
to
the
boat
the
whole
salvation
of
the
human
race
is
figured
in
this
story
it
is
all
christ
my
does
this
help
you
to
believe
at
all
i
think
it
does
papa
but
it
wants
thinking
over
a
good
deal
i
always
find
as
i
think
that
lighter
bits
shine
out
here
and
there
in
a
thing
i
have
no
hope
of
understanding
altogether
that
always
helps
me
to
believe
that
the
rest
might
be
understood
too
if
i
were
only
clever
simple
enough
not
clever
enough
my
but
there
s
one
thing
said
my
wife
that
is
more
interesting
to
me
than
what
you
have
been
talking
about
it
is
the
other
instances
in
the
life
of
peter
in
which
you
said
he
failed
in
a
similar
manner
from
pride
or
one
at
least
seems
to
me
very
clear
you
have
often
remarked
to
me
ethel
how
little
praise
servants
can
stand
how
almost
invariably
after
you
have
commended
the
diligence
or
skill
of
any
of
your
household
as
you
felt
bound
to
do
one
of
the
first
visible
results
was
either
a
falling
away
in
the
performance
by
which
she
had
gained
the
praise
or
a
more
or
less
violent
access
according
to
the
nature
of
the
individual
of
soon
breaking
out
in
bad
temper
or
impertinence
now
you
will
see
precisely
the
same
kind
of
thing
in
here
i
opened
my
new
testament
and
read
fragmentarily
but
whom
say
ye
that
i
am
thou
art
the
christ
the
son
of
the
living
god
blessed
art
thou
simon
my
father
hath
revealed
that
unto
thee
i
will
give
unto
thee
the
keys
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
i
must
suffer
many
things
and
be
killed
and
be
raised
again
the
third
day
be
it
far
from
thee
lord
this
shall
not
be
unto
thee
get
thee
behind
me
satan
thou
art
an
offence
unto
just
contemplate
the
change
here
in
the
words
of
our
lord
blessed
art
thou
art
an
offence
unto
think
what
change
has
passed
on
peter
s
mood
before
the
second
of
these
words
could
be
addressed
to
him
to
whom
the
first
had
just
been
spoken
the
lord
had
praised
him
peter
grew
even
to
the
rebuking
of
him
whose
praise
had
so
uplifted
him
but
it
is
ever
so
a
man
will
gain
a
great
moral
victory
glad
first
then
uplifted
he
will
fall
before
a
paltry
temptation
i
have
sometimes
wondered
too
whether
his
denial
of
our
lord
had
anything
to
do
with
his
satisfaction
with
himself
for
making
that
onslaught
upon
the
high
priest
s
servant
it
was
a
brave
thing
and
a
faithful
to
draw
a
single
sword
against
a
multitude
in
his
fiery
eagerness
and
inexperience
the
blow
well
meant
to
cleave
malchus
s
head
missed
and
only
cut
off
his
ear
but
peter
had
herein
justified
his
confident
saying
that
he
would
not
deny
him
he
was
not
one
to
deny
his
lord
who
had
been
the
first
to
confess
him
yet
ere
the
cock
had
crowed
ere
the
morning
had
dawned
the
vulgar
grandeur
of
the
palace
of
the
high
priest
for
let
it
be
art
itself
it
was
vulgar
grandeur
beside
that
grandeur
which
it
caused
peter
to
deny
and
the
accusing
tone
of
a
were
enough
to
make
him
quail
whom
the
crowd
with
lanterns
and
torches
and
weapons
had
only
roused
to
fight
true
he
was
excited
then
and
now
he
was
cold
in
the
middle
of
the
night
with
jesus
gone
from
his
sight
a
prisoner
and
for
the
faces
of
friends
that
had
there
surrounded
him
and
strengthened
him
with
their
sympathy
now
only
the
faces
of
those
who
were
or
whom
at
least
peter
thought
to
be
on
the
other
side
looking
at
him
curiously
as
a
strange
intruder
into
their
domains
alas
that
the
courage
which
led
him
to
follow
the
lord
should
have
thus
led
him
not
to
deny
him
but
into
the
denial
of
him
yet
why
should
i
say
if
the
denial
of
our
lord
lay
in
his
heart
a
possible
thing
only
prevented
by
his
being
kept
in
favourable
circumstances
for
confessing
him
it
was
a
thousand
times
better
that
he
should
deny
him
and
thus
know
what
a
poor
weak
thing
that
heart
of
his
was
trust
it
no
more
and
give
it
up
to
the
master
to
make
it
strong
and
pure
and
grand
for
such
an
end
the
lord
was
willing
to
bear
all
the
pain
of
peter
s
denial
o
the
love
of
that
son
of
man
who
in
the
midst
of
all
the
wretched
weaknesses
of
those
who
surrounded
him
loved
the
best
in
them
and
looked
forward
to
his
own
victory
for
them
that
they
might
become
all
that
they
were
meant
to
be
like
him
that
the
lovely
glimmerings
of
truth
and
love
that
were
in
them
now
the
breakings
forth
of
the
light
that
lighteneth
every
man
might
grow
into
the
perfect
human
day
loving
them
even
the
more
that
they
were
so
helpless
so
oppressed
so
far
from
that
ideal
which
was
their
life
and
which
all
their
dim
desires
were
reaching
after
here
i
ceased
and
a
little
overcome
with
the
great
picture
in
my
soul
to
which
i
had
been
able
only
to
give
the
poorest
expression
rose
and
retired
to
my
own
room
there
i
could
only
fall
on
my
knees
and
pray
that
the
lord
christ
who
had
died
for
me
might
have
his
own
way
with
me
that
it
might
be
worth
his
while
to
have
done
what
he
did
and
what
he
was
doing
now
for
me
to
my
elder
brother
my
lord
and
my
god
i
gave
myself
yet
again
confidently
because
he
cared
to
have
me
and
my
very
breath
was
his
i
be
what
he
wanted
who
knew
all
about
it
and
had
done
everything
that
i
might
be
a
son
of
god
a
living
glory
of
gladness
chapter
ii
niceboots
the
next
morning
the
captain
of
the
lost
vessel
called
upon
me
early
to
thank
me
for
himself
and
his
men
he
was
a
fine
burly
fellow
dressed
in
blue
from
head
to
heel
he
might
have
sat
for
a
portrait
of
chaucer
s
shipman
as
far
as
his
hue
and
the
first
look
of
him
went
it
was
clear
that
in
many
a
tempest
had
his
beard
be
shake
and
certainly
the
hote
somer
had
made
his
hew
all
broun
but
farther
the
likeness
would
hardly
go
for
the
good
fellow
which
chaucer
applies
with
such
irony
to
the
shipman
of
his
time
who
would
filch
wine
and
drown
all
the
captives
he
made
in
a
was
clearly
applicable
in
good
earnest
to
this
shipman
still
i
thought
i
had
something
to
bring
against
him
and
therefore
before
we
parted
i
said
to
him
they
tell
me
captain
that
your
vessel
was
not
seaworthy
and
that
you
could
not
but
have
known
she
was
my
own
craft
sir
and
i
judged
her
fit
for
several
voyages
more
if
she
had
been
a
she
couldn
t
have
been
mine
and
a
man
must
do
what
he
can
for
his
but
you
were
risking
your
life
you
a
few
chances
more
or
less
don
t
much
signify
to
a
sailor
sir
there
ain
t
nothing
to
be
done
without
risk
you
ll
find
an
old
tub
go
voyage
after
voyage
and
she
beyond
bail
and
a
clipper
fresh
off
the
stocks
go
down
in
the
harbour
it
s
all
in
the
luck
sir
i
assure
well
if
it
were
your
own
life
i
should
have
nothing
to
say
seeing
you
have
a
family
to
look
after
but
what
about
the
poor
fellows
who
made
the
voyage
with
you
did
they
know
what
kind
of
a
vessel
they
were
embarking
in
wherever
the
captain
s
ready
to
go
he
ll
always
find
men
ready
to
follow
him
bless
you
sir
they
never
asks
no
questions
if
a
sailor
was
always
to
be
thinking
of
the
chances
he
d
never
set
his
foot
off
still
i
don
t
think
it
s
right
they
shouldn
t
i
daresay
they
knowed
all
about
the
old
brig
as
well
as
i
did
myself
you
gets
to
know
all
about
a
craft
just
as
you
do
about
her
captain
she
s
got
a
character
of
her
own
and
she
can
t
hide
it
long
any
more
than
you
can
hide
yours
sir
begging
your
i
daresay
that
s
all
correct
but
still
i
shouldn
t
like
anyone
to
say
to
me
you
ought
to
have
told
me
therefore
you
see
i
m
telling
you
captain
and
now
i
m
have
a
glass
of
wine
before
you
go
i
concluded
ringing
the
bell
thank
you
sir
i
ll
turn
over
what
you
ve
been
saying
and
anyhow
i
take
it
kind
of
so
we
parted
i
have
never
seen
him
since
and
shall
not
most
likely
in
this
world
but
he
looked
like
a
man
that
could
understand
why
and
wherefore
i
spoke
as
i
did
and
i
had
the
advantage
of
having
had
a
chance
of
doing
something
for
him
first
of
all
let
no
man
who
wants
to
do
anything
for
the
soul
of
a
man
lose
a
chance
of
doing
something
for
his
body
he
ought
to
be
willing
and
ready
which
is
more
than
willing
to
do
that
whether
or
not
but
there
are
those
who
need
this
reminder
of
many
a
soul
jesus
laid
hold
by
healing
the
suffering
the
body
brought
upon
it
no
one
but
himself
can
tell
how
much
the
nucleus
of
the
church
was
composed
of
and
by
those
who
had
received
health
from
his
hands
from
the
word
of
his
mouth
my
own
opinion
is
that
herein
lay
the
very
germ
of
the
kernel
of
what
is
now
the
ancient
was
then
the
infant
church
that
from
them
next
to
the
disciples
themselves
went
forth
the
chief
power
of
life
in
love
for
they
too
had
seen
the
lord
and
in
their
own
humble
way
could
preach
and
teach
concerning
him
what
memories
of
him
theirs
must
have
been
things
went
on
very
quietly
that
is
as
i
mean
now
from
the
of
a
historian
without
much
to
record
bearing
notably
upon
after
events
for
the
greater
part
of
the
next
week
i
wandered
about
my
parish
making
acquaintance
with
different
people
in
an
outside
sort
of
way
only
now
and
then
finding
an
opportunity
of
seeing
into
their
souls
except
by
conclusion
but
i
enjoyed
endlessly
the
aspects
of
the
country
it
was
not
picturesque
except
in
parts
there
was
little
wood
and
there
were
no
hills
only
undulations
though
many
of
them
were
steep
enough
even
from
a
pedestrian
s
point
of
view
neither
however
were
there
any
plains
except
high
moorland
tracts
but
the
impression
of
the
whole
country
was
large
airy
sunshiny
and
it
was
clasped
in
the
arms
of
the
infinite
awful
yet
how
bountiful
sea
if
one
will
look
at
the
ocean
in
its
not
to
say
its
eternal
aspects
and
not
out
of
the
fears
of
a
hidebound
love
of
life
the
sea
and
the
sky
i
must
confess
dwarfed
the
earth
made
it
of
small
account
beside
them
but
who
could
complain
of
such
an
influence
at
least
not
i
my
children
bathed
in
this
sea
every
day
and
gathered
strength
and
knowledge
from
it
it
was
as
i
have
indicated
a
dangerous
coast
to
bathe
upon
the
sweep
of
the
tides
varied
with
the
varying
sands
that
were
cast
up
there
was
now
in
one
place
now
in
another
a
strong
as
they
called
it
a
reflux
that
is
of
the
inflowing
waters
which
was
quite
sufficient
to
carry
those
who
could
not
swim
out
into
the
great
deep
and
rendered
much
exertion
necessary
even
in
those
who
could
to
regain
the
shore
but
there
was
a
fine
strong
cornish
woman
to
take
charge
of
the
ladies
and
the
little
boys
and
she
watching
the
ways
of
the
wild
monster
knew
the
when
and
the
where
and
all
about
it
connie
got
out
upon
the
downs
every
day
she
improved
in
health
certainly
and
we
thought
a
little
even
in
her
powers
of
motion
the
weather
continued
superb
what
rain
there
was
fell
at
night
just
enough
for
nature
to
wash
her
face
with
and
so
look
quite
fresh
in
the
morning
we
contrived
a
dinner
on
the
sands
on
the
other
side
of
the
bay
for
the
friday
of
this
same
week
the
morning
rose
gloriously
harry
and
charlie
were
turning
the
house
upside
down
to
judge
by
their
noise
long
before
i
was
in
the
humour
to
get
up
for
i
had
been
reading
late
the
night
before
i
never
made
much
objection
to
mere
noise
knowing
that
i
could
stop
it
the
moment
i
pleased
and
knowing
which
was
of
more
consequence
that
so
far
from
there
being
anything
wrong
in
making
a
noise
the
sea
would
make
noise
enough
in
our
ears
before
we
left
kilkhaven
the
moment
however
that
i
heard
a
thread
of
whining
or
a
burst
of
anger
in
the
noise
i
would
interfere
at
once
treating
these
just
as
things
that
must
be
dismissed
at
once
harry
and
charlie
were
i
say
to
use
their
own
form
of
speech
making
such
a
row
that
morning
however
that
i
was
afraid
of
some
injury
to
the
house
or
furniture
which
were
not
our
own
so
i
opened
my
door
and
called
out
harry
charlie
what
on
earth
are
you
about
nothing
papa
answered
charlie
only
it
s
so
jolly
what
is
jolly
my
boy
i
asked
o
i
don
t
know
papa
it
s
jolly
is
it
the
sunshine
thought
i
and
the
wind
god
s
world
all
over
the
god
of
gladness
in
the
hearts
of
the
lads
is
it
that
no
wonder
then
that
they
can
not
tell
yet
what
it
is
i
withdrew
into
my
room
and
so
far
from
seeking
to
put
an
end
to
the
noise
i
knew
connie
did
not
mind
it
listened
to
it
with
a
kind
of
reverence
as
the
outcome
of
a
gladness
which
the
god
of
joy
had
kindled
in
their
hearts
soon
after
however
i
heard
certain
dim
growls
of
expostulation
from
harry
and
having
from
experience
ground
for
believing
that
the
elder
was
tyrannising
over
the
younger
i
stopped
that
and
the
noise
together
sending
charlie
to
find
out
where
the
tide
would
be
between
one
and
two
o
clock
and
harry
to
run
to
the
top
of
the
hill
and
find
out
the
direction
of
the
wind
before
i
was
dressed
charlie
was
knocking
at
my
door
with
the
news
that
it
would
be
about
one
and
harry
speedily
followed
with
the
discovery
that
the
wind
was
by
which
of
course
determined
that
the
sun
would
shine
all
day
as
the
drew
near
the
servants
went
over
with
walter
at
their
head
to
choose
a
rock
convenient
for
a
table
under
the
shelter
of
the
rocks
on
the
sands
across
the
bay
thither
when
walter
returned
we
bore
our
connie
carrying
her
litter
close
by
the
edge
of
the
retreating
tide
which
sometimes
broke
in
a
ripple
of
music
under
her
wetting
our
feet
with
innocuous
rush
the
child
s
delight
was
extreme
as
she
thus
skimmed
the
edge
of
the
ocean
with
the
little
ones
gambolling
about
her
and
her
mamma
and
wynnie
walking
quietly
on
the
landward
side
for
she
wished
to
have
no
one
between
her
and
the
sea
after
scrambling
with
difficulty
over
some
rocky
ledges
and
stopping
at
connie
s
request
to
let
her
look
into
a
deep
pool
in
the
sand
which
somehow
or
other
retained
the
water
after
the
rest
had
retreated
we
set
her
down
near
the
mouth
of
a
cave
in
the
shadow
of
a
rock
and
there
was
our
dinner
nicely
laid
for
us
on
a
flat
rock
in
front
of
the
cave
the
cliffs
rose
behind
us
with
curiously
curved
and
variously
angled
strata
the
sun
in
his
full
splendour
threw
dark
shadows
on
the
brilliant
yellow
sand
more
and
more
of
which
appeared
as
the
bright
blue
water
withdrew
itself
now
rippling
over
it
as
if
it
meant
to
hide
it
all
up
again
now
uncovering
more
as
it
withdrew
for
another
rush
before
we
had
finished
our
dinner
the
foremost
wavelets
appeared
so
far
away
over
the
plain
of
the
sand
that
it
seemed
a
long
walk
to
the
edge
that
had
been
almost
at
our
feet
a
little
while
ago
between
us
and
it
lay
a
lovely
desert
of
glittering
sand
when
even
charlie
and
harry
had
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
it
was
time
to
stop
eating
we
left
the
shadow
and
went
out
into
the
sun
carrying
connie
and
laying
her
down
in
the
midst
of
the
ribbed
which
was
very
ribby
on
a
shawl
a
little
way
off
from
her
lay
her
baby
crowing
and
kicking
with
the
same
jollity
that
had
possessed
the
boys
ever
since
the
morning
i
wandered
about
with
wynnie
on
the
sands
picking
up
amongst
other
things
strange
creatures
in
thin
shells
ending
in
tufts
if
i
remember
rightly
my
wife
sat
on
the
end
of
connie
s
litter
and
dora
and
the
boys
a
little
way
off
were
trying
how
far
the
full
force
of
three
wooden
spades
could
in
digging
a
hole
keep
ahead
of
the
water
which
was
ever
tumbling
in
the
sand
from
the
sides
of
the
same
behind
the
servants
were
busy
washing
the
plates
in
a
pool
and
burying
the
fragments
of
the
feast
for
i
made
it
a
rule
wherever
we
went
that
the
fair
face
of
nature
was
not
to
be
defiled
i
have
always
taken
the
part
of
excursionists
in
these
latter
days
of
running
to
and
fro
against
those
who
complain
that
the
loveliest
places
are
being
destroyed
by
their
inroads
but
there
is
one
most
offensive
even
disgusting
habit
amongst
them
that
of
leaving
bones
fragments
of
meat
pies
and
worse
than
all
pieces
of
greasy
paper
about
the
place
which
i
can
not
excuse
or
at
least
defend
even
the
surface
of
cumberland
and
westmoreland
lakes
will
be
defiled
with
these
floating
abominations
not
abominations
at
all
if
they
are
decently
burned
or
buried
when
done
with
but
certainly
abominations
when
left
to
be
cast
hither
and
thither
in
the
wind
over
the
grass
or
on
the
eddy
and
ripple
of
the
pure
water
for
days
after
those
who
have
thus
left
their
shame
behind
them
have
returned
to
their
shops
or
factories
i
forgive
them
for
trampling
down
the
grass
and
the
ferns
that
can
not
be
helped
and
in
comparison
of
the
good
they
get
is
not
to
be
considered
at
all
but
why
should
they
leave
such
a
savage
trail
behind
them
as
this
forgetting
too
that
though
they
have
done
with
the
spot
there
are
others
coming
after
them
to
whom
these
remnants
must
be
an
offence
at
length
in
our
roaming
wynnie
and
i
approached
a
long
low
ridge
of
rock
rising
towards
the
sea
into
which
it
ran
crossing
this
we
came
suddenly
upon
the
painter
whom
dora
had
called
niceboots
sitting
with
a
small
easel
before
him
we
were
right
above
him
ere
we
knew
he
had
his
back
towards
us
so
that
we
saw
at
once
what
he
was
painting
o
papa
cried
wynnie
involuntarily
and
the
painter
looked
round
i
beg
your
pardon
i
said
we
came
over
from
the
other
side
and
did
not
see
you
before
i
hope
we
have
not
disturbed
you
not
in
the
least
he
answered
courteously
and
rose
as
he
spoke
i
saw
that
the
subject
on
his
easel
suggested
that
of
which
wynnie
had
been
making
a
sketch
at
the
same
time
on
the
day
when
connie
first
lay
on
the
top
of
the
opposite
cliff
but
he
was
not
even
looking
in
the
same
direction
now
do
you
mind
having
your
work
seen
before
it
is
finished
not
in
the
least
if
the
spectators
will
do
me
the
favour
to
remember
that
most
processes
have
to
go
through
a
seemingly
chaotic
stage
he
answered
i
was
struck
with
the
mode
and
tone
of
the
remark
here
is
no
common
man
i
said
to
myself
and
responded
to
him
in
something
of
a
similar
style
i
wish
we
could
always
keep
that
in
mind
with
regard
to
human
beings
themselves
as
well
as
their
works
i
said
aloud
the
painter
looked
at
me
and
i
looked
at
him
we
speak
each
from
the
experience
of
his
own
profession
i
presume
he
said
but
i
returned
glancing
at
the
little
picture
in
oils
upon
his
easel
your
work
here
though
my
knowledge
of
painting
is
next
to
nothing
perhaps
i
ought
to
say
nothing
at
all
this
picture
must
have
long
ago
passed
the
chaotic
it
is
nearly
as
much
finished
as
i
care
to
make
it
he
returned
i
hardly
count
this
work
at
all
i
am
chiefly
amusing
or
rather
pleasing
my
own
fancy
at
apparently
i
remarked
you
had
the
conical
rock
outside
the
hay
for
your
model
and
now
you
are
finishing
it
with
your
back
turned
towards
it
how
is
that
i
will
soon
explain
he
answered
the
moment
i
saw
this
rock
it
reminded
me
of
dante
s
ah
you
are
a
reader
of
dante
i
said
in
the
original
i
yes
a
friend
of
mine
a
brother
painter
an
italian
set
me
going
with
that
and
once
going
with
dante
nobody
could
well
stop
i
never
knew
what
intensity
was
till
i
began
to
read
that
is
quite
my
own
feeling
now
to
return
to
your
without
departing
at
all
from
natural
forms
i
thought
to
make
it
suggest
the
purgatorio
to
anyone
who
remembered
the
description
given
of
the
place
by
ulysses
in
the
end
of
the
canto
of
the
inferno
of
course
that
thing
there
is
a
mere
rock
yet
it
has
certain
mountain
forms
about
it
i
have
put
it
at
a
much
greater
distance
you
see
and
have
sought
to
make
it
look
a
solitary
mountain
in
the
midst
of
a
great
water
you
will
discover
even
now
that
the
circles
of
the
purgatory
are
suggested
without
any
approach
i
think
to
artificial
structure
and
there
are
occasional
hints
at
figures
which
you
can
not
definitely
detach
from
the
rocks
which
by
the
way
you
must
remember
were
in
one
part
full
of
sculptures
i
have
kept
the
mountain
near
enough
however
to
indicate
the
great
expanse
of
wild
flowers
on
the
top
which
matilda
was
so
busy
gathering
i
want
to
indicate
too
the
wind
up
there
in
the
terrestrial
paradise
ever
and
always
blowing
one
way
you
remember
walton
for
the
young
man
getting
animated
began
to
talk
as
if
we
had
known
each
other
for
some
time
and
here
he
repeated
the
purport
of
dante
s
words
in
english
an
air
of
sweetness
changeless
in
its
flow
with
no
more
strength
than
in
a
soft
wind
lies
smote
peacefully
against
me
on
the
brow
by
which
the
leaves
all
trembling
did
every
one
bend
thitherward
to
where
the
high
mount
throws
its
shadow
at
i
thought
you
said
you
did
not
use
translations
i
thought
it
possible
that
miss
walton
interrogatively
this
might
not
follow
the
italian
so
easily
and
i
feared
to
seem
she
won
t
lag
far
behind
i
flatter
myself
i
returned
whose
translation
do
you
quote
he
hesitated
a
moment
then
said
carelessly
i
have
cobbled
a
few
passages
after
that
fashion
it
has
the
merit
of
being
near
the
original
at
least
i
returned
and
that
seems
to
me
one
of
the
chief
merits
a
translation
can
then
the
painter
resumed
rather
hastily
as
if
to
avoid
any
further
remark
upon
his
verses
you
see
those
white
things
in
the
air
above
here
he
turned
to
wynnie
miss
walton
will
remember
i
think
she
was
making
a
drawing
of
the
rock
at
the
same
time
i
was
how
the
seagulls
or
some
such
birds
only
two
or
three
of
them
kept
flitting
about
the
top
of
it
i
remember
quite
well
answered
wynnie
with
a
look
of
appeal
to
me
yes
i
interposed
my
daughter
in
describing
what
she
had
been
attempting
to
draw
spoke
especially
of
the
birds
over
the
rock
for
she
said
the
white
lapping
of
the
waves
looked
like
spirits
trying
to
get
loose
and
the
white
birds
like
foam
that
had
broken
its
chains
and
risen
in
triumph
into
the
here
niceboots
for
as
yet
i
did
not
know
what
else
to
call
him
looked
at
wynnie
almost
with
a
start
how
wonderfully
that
falls
in
with
my
fancy
about
the
rock
he
said
purgatory
indeed
with
imprisoned
souls
lapping
at
its
foot
and
the
free
souls
winging
their
way
aloft
in
ether
well
this
world
is
a
kind
of
purgatory
anyhow
is
it
not
walton
certainly
it
is
we
are
here
tried
as
by
fire
to
see
what
our
work
is
whether
wood
hay
and
stubble
or
gold
and
silver
and
precious
you
see
resumed
the
painter
if
anybody
only
glanced
at
my
little
picture
he
would
take
those
for
but
if
he
looked
into
it
and
began
to
suspect
me
he
would
find
out
that
they
were
dante
and
beatrice
on
their
way
to
the
sphere
of
the
in
one
respect
at
least
then
your
picture
has
the
merit
of
corresponding
to
fact
for
what
thing
is
there
in
the
world
or
what
group
of
things
in
which
the
natural
man
will
not
see
merely
the
things
of
nature
but
the
spiritual
man
the
things
of
the
spirit
i
am
no
theologian
said
the
painter
turning
away
i
thought
somewhat
coldly
but
i
could
see
that
wynnie
was
greatly
interested
in
him
perhaps
she
thought
that
here
was
some
enlightenment
of
the
riddle
of
the
world
for
her
if
she
could
but
get
at
what
he
was
thinking
she
was
used
to
my
way
of
it
here
might
be
something
new
if
i
can
be
of
any
service
to
miss
walton
with
her
drawing
i
shall
be
happy
he
said
turning
again
towards
me
but
his
last
gesture
had
made
me
a
little
distrustful
of
him
and
i
received
his
advances
on
this
point
with
a
coldness
which
i
did
not
wish
to
make
more
marked
than
his
own
towards
my
last
observation
you
are
very
kind
i
said
but
miss
walton
does
not
presume
to
be
an
i
saw
a
slight
shade
pass
over
wynnie
s
countenance
when
i
turned
to
niceboots
a
shade
of
a
different
sort
was
on
his
surely
i
had
said
something
wrong
to
cast
a
gloom
on
two
young
faces
i
made
haste
to
make
amends
we
are
just
going
to
have
some
coffee
i
said
for
my
servants
i
see
have
managed
to
kindle
a
fire
will
you
come
and
allow
me
to
introduce
you
to
walton
with
much
pleasure
he
answered
rising
from
the
rock
whereon
as
he
spoke
about
his
picture
he
had
again
seated
himself
he
was
a
sunburnt
fellow
with
clear
gray
eyes
notwithstanding
a
rather
roman
nose
and
good
features
generally
but
there
was
an
air
of
suppression
if
not
of
sadness
about
him
however
did
not
in
the
least
interfere
with
the
manliness
of
his
countenance
or
of
its
expression
but
i
said
how
am
i
to
effect
an
introduction
seeing
i
do
not
yet
know
your
i
had
had
to
keep
a
sharp
on
myself
lest
i
should
call
him
niceboots
he
smiled
very
graciously
and
replied
my
name
is
percivale
charles
a
descendant
of
sir
percivale
of
king
arthur
s
round
table
i
can
not
count
quite
so
far
back
he
answered
as
that
not
quite
to
the
conquest
he
added
with
a
slight
deepening
of
his
sunburnt
hue
i
do
come
of
a
fighting
race
but
i
can
not
claim
sir
we
were
now
walking
along
the
edge
of
the
still
retreating
waves
towards
the
group
upon
the
sands
percivale
and
i
foremost
and
wynnie
lingering
behind
o
do
look
here
papa
she
cried
from
some
little
distance
we
turned
and
saw
her
gazing
at
something
on
the
sand
at
her
feet
hastening
back
we
found
it
to
be
a
little
narrow
line
of
which
the
water
had
left
behind
it
on
the
sand
slowly
breaking
and
passing
out
of
sight
why
there
should
be
there
then
and
not
always
i
do
not
know
but
there
they
were
and
such
colours
deep
rose
and
grassy
green
and
ultramarine
blue
and
above
all
one
dark
yet
brilliant
and
metallic
gold
all
of
them
were
of
a
burnished
colour
like
opaque
laid
on
behind
translucent
crystal
those
little
ocean
bubbles
were
well
worth
turning
to
see
and
so
i
said
to
wynnie
but
as
we
gazed
they
went
on
vanishing
one
by
one
every
moment
a
heavenly
glory
of
hue
burst
and
was
nowhere
we
walked
away
again
towards
the
rest
of
our
party
don
t
you
think
those
bubbles
more
beautiful
than
any
precious
stones
you
ever
saw
papa
yes
my
love
i
think
they
are
except
it
be
the
opal
in
the
opal
god
seems
to
have
fixed
the
evanescent
and
made
the
vanishing
and
flowers
are
more
beautiful
things
than
jewels
she
said
interrogatively
many
perhaps
most
flowers
are
i
granted
and
did
you
ever
see
such
curves
and
delicate
textures
anywhere
else
as
in
the
clouds
papa
i
think
not
in
the
cirrhous
clouds
at
least
the
frozen
ones
but
what
are
you
putting
me
to
my
catechism
for
in
this
way
my
child
o
papa
i
could
go
on
a
long
time
with
that
catechism
but
i
will
end
with
one
question
more
which
you
will
perhaps
find
a
little
harder
to
answer
only
i
daresay
you
have
had
an
answer
ready
for
years
lest
one
of
us
should
ask
you
some
no
my
love
i
never
got
an
answer
ready
for
anything
lest
one
of
my
children
should
ask
me
but
it
is
not
surprising
either
that
children
should
be
puzzled
about
the
things
that
have
puzzled
their
father
or
that
by
the
time
they
are
able
to
put
the
questions
he
should
have
found
out
some
sort
of
an
answer
to
most
of
them
go
on
with
your
catechism
wynnie
now
for
your
puzzle
it
s
not
a
funny
question
papa
it
s
a
very
serious
one
i
can
t
think
why
the
unchanging
god
should
have
made
all
the
most
beautiful
things
wither
and
grow
ugly
or
burst
and
vanish
or
die
somehow
and
be
no
more
mamma
is
not
so
beautiful
as
she
once
was
is
she
in
one
way
no
but
in
another
and
better
way
much
more
so
but
we
will
not
talk
about
her
kind
of
beauty
just
now
we
will
keep
to
the
more
material
loveliness
of
which
you
have
been
speaking
though
in
truth
no
loveliness
can
be
only
material
well
then
for
my
answer
it
is
i
think
because
god
loves
the
beauty
so
much
that
he
makes
all
beautiful
things
vanish
i
do
not
understand
you
i
daresay
not
my
dear
but
i
will
explain
to
you
a
little
if
percivale
will
excuse
on
the
contrary
i
am
greatly
interested
both
in
the
question
and
the
well
then
wynnie
everything
has
a
soul
and
a
body
or
something
like
them
by
the
body
we
know
the
soul
but
we
are
always
ready
to
love
the
body
instead
of
the
soul
therefore
god
makes
the
body
die
continually
that
we
may
learn
to
love
the
soul
indeed
the
world
is
full
of
beautiful
things
but
god
has
saved
many
men
from
loving
the
mere
bodies
of
them
by
making
them
poor
and
more
still
by
reminding
them
that
if
they
be
as
rich
as
croesus
all
their
lives
they
will
be
as
poor
as
diogenes
poorer
without
even
a
tub
when
this
world
with
all
its
pictures
scenery
books
and
alas
for
some
christians
bibles
even
shall
have
vanished
why
do
you
say
papa
if
they
are
christians
especially
i
say
only
from
their
point
of
view
not
from
mine
i
mean
such
as
are
always
talking
and
arguing
from
the
bible
and
never
giving
themselves
any
trouble
to
do
what
it
tells
them
they
insist
on
the
anise
and
cummin
and
forget
the
judgment
mercy
and
faith
these
worship
the
body
of
the
truth
and
forget
the
soul
of
it
if
the
flowers
were
not
perishable
we
should
cease
to
contemplate
their
beauty
either
blinded
by
the
passion
for
hoarding
the
bodies
of
them
or
dulled
by
the
hebetude
of
commonplaceness
that
the
constant
presence
of
them
would
occasion
to
compare
great
things
with
small
the
flowers
wither
the
bubbles
break
the
clouds
and
sunsets
pass
for
the
very
same
holy
reason
in
the
degree
of
its
application
to
them
for
which
the
lord
withdrew
from
his
disciples
and
ascended
again
to
his
father
that
the
comforter
the
spirit
of
truth
the
soul
of
things
might
come
to
them
and
abide
with
them
and
so
the
son
return
and
the
father
be
revealed
the
flower
is
not
its
loveliness
and
its
loveliness
we
must
love
else
we
shall
only
treat
them
as
children
who
gather
and
gather
and
fill
hands
and
baskets
from
a
mere
desire
of
acquisition
excusable
enough
in
them
but
the
same
in
kind
however
harmless
in
mode
and
degree
and
object
as
the
avarice
of
the
miser
therefore
god
that
we
may
always
have
them
and
ever
learn
to
love
their
beauty
and
yet
more
their
truth
sends
the
beneficent
winter
that
we
may
think
about
what
we
have
lost
and
welcome
them
when
they
come
again
with
greater
tenderness
and
love
with
clearer
eyes
to
see
and
purer
hearts
to
understand
the
spirit
that
dwells
in
them
we
can
not
do
without
the
winter
of
our
shakspere
surely
saw
that
when
he
makes
titania
say
in
midsummer
night
s
the
human
mortals
want
their
winter
here
namely
to
set
things
right
and
none
of
those
editors
who
would
alter
the
line
seem
to
have
been
capable
of
understanding
its
i
think
i
understand
you
a
little
answered
wynnie
then
changing
her
tone
i
told
you
papa
you
would
have
an
answer
ready
didn
t
i
yes
my
child
but
with
this
difference
i
found
the
answer
to
meet
my
own
necessities
not
and
so
you
had
it
ready
for
me
when
i
wanted
just
so
that
is
the
only
certainty
you
have
in
regard
to
what
you
give
away
no
one
who
has
not
tasted
it
and
found
it
good
has
a
right
to
offer
any
spiritual
dish
to
his
percivale
took
no
part
in
our
conversation
the
moment
i
had
presented
him
to
walton
and
connie
and
he
had
paid
his
respects
by
a
somewhat
stately
obeisance
he
merged
the
salutation
into
a
farewell
and
either
forgetting
my
offer
of
coffee
or
having
changed
his
mind
withdrew
a
little
to
my
disappointment
for
notwithstanding
his
lack
of
response
where
some
things
he
said
would
have
led
me
to
expect
it
i
had
begun
to
feel
much
interested
in
him
he
was
scarcely
beyond
hearing
when
dora
came
up
to
me
from
her
digging
with
an
eager
look
on
her
sunny
face
hasn
t
he
got
nice
boots
papa
indeed
my
dear
i
am
unable
to
support
you
in
that
assertion
for
i
never
saw
his
i
did
then
returned
the
child
and
i
never
saw
such
nice
i
accept
the
statement
willingly
i
replied
and
we
heard
no
more
of
the
boots
for
his
name
was
now
substituted
for
his
nickname
nor
did
i
see
himself
again
for
some
days
not
in
fact
till
next
sunday
though
why
he
should
come
to
church
at
all
was
something
of
a
puzzle
to
me
especially
when
i
knew
him
better
chapter
iii
the
blacksmith
the
next
day
i
set
out
after
breakfast
to
inquire
about
a
blacksmith
it
was
not
every
or
any
blacksmith
that
would
do
i
must
not
fix
on
the
first
to
do
my
work
because
he
was
the
first
there
was
one
in
the
village
i
soon
learned
but
i
found
him
an
ordinary
man
who
i
have
no
doubt
could
shoe
a
horse
and
avoid
the
quick
but
from
whom
any
greater
delicacy
of
touch
was
not
to
be
expected
inquiring
further
i
heard
of
a
young
smith
who
had
lately
settled
in
a
hamlet
a
couple
of
miles
distant
but
still
within
the
parish
in
the
afternoon
i
set
out
to
find
him
to
my
surprise
he
was
a
man
with
a
huge
frame
which
appeared
worn
rather
than
naturally
thin
and
large
eyes
that
looked
at
the
anvil
as
if
it
was
the
horizon
of
the
world
he
had
got
a
in
his
tongs
when
i
entered
notwithstanding
the
fire
that
glowed
on
the
hearth
and
the
sparks
that
flew
like
a
nimbus
in
eruption
from
about
his
person
the
place
looked
very
dark
to
me
entering
from
the
glorious
blaze
of
the
almost
noontide
sun
and
felt
cool
after
the
deep
lane
through
which
i
had
come
and
which
had
seemed
a
very
reservoir
of
sunbeams
i
could
see
the
smith
by
the
glow
of
his
but
all
between
me
and
the
shoe
was
dark
i
said
it
is
a
good
thing
to
find
a
man
by
his
work
i
heard
you
half
a
mile
off
or
so
and
now
i
see
you
but
only
by
the
glow
of
your
work
it
is
a
grand
thing
to
work
in
he
lifted
his
hammered
hand
to
his
forehead
courteously
and
as
lightly
as
if
the
hammer
had
been
the
of
a
whip
i
don
t
know
if
you
would
say
the
same
if
you
had
to
work
at
it
in
weather
like
this
he
answered
if
i
did
not
i
returned
that
would
be
the
fault
of
my
weakness
and
would
not
affect
the
assertion
i
have
just
made
that
it
is
a
fine
thing
to
work
in
well
you
may
be
right
he
rejoined
with
a
sigh
as
throwing
the
he
had
been
fashioning
from
the
tongs
on
the
ground
he
next
let
the
hammer
drop
beside
the
anvil
and
leaning
against
it
held
his
head
for
a
moment
between
his
hands
and
regarded
the
floor
it
does
not
much
matter
to
me
he
went
on
if
i
only
get
through
my
work
and
have
done
with
it
no
man
shall
say
i
shirked
what
i
d
got
to
do
and
then
when
it
s
over
there
won
t
be
a
word
to
say
agen
me
or
he
did
not
finish
the
sentence
and
now
i
could
see
the
sunlight
lying
in
a
somewhat
dreary
patch
if
the
word
can
be
truly
used
with
respect
to
any
manifestation
of
sunlight
on
the
dark
clay
floor
i
hope
you
are
not
ill
i
said
he
made
no
answer
but
taking
up
his
tongs
caught
with
it
from
a
beam
one
of
a
number
of
which
hung
there
and
put
it
on
the
fire
to
be
fashioned
to
a
certain
fit
while
he
turned
it
in
the
fire
and
blew
the
bellows
i
stood
regarding
him
this
man
will
do
for
my
work
i
said
to
myself
though
i
should
not
wonder
from
the
look
of
him
if
it
was
the
last
piece
of
work
he
ever
did
under
the
new
the
smith
s
words
broke
in
on
my
meditations
when
i
was
a
little
boy
he
said
i
once
wanted
to
stay
at
home
from
school
i
had
i
believe
a
little
headache
but
nothing
worth
minding
i
told
my
mother
that
i
had
a
headache
and
she
kept
me
and
i
helped
her
at
her
spinning
which
was
what
i
liked
best
of
anything
but
in
the
afternoon
the
methodist
preacher
came
in
to
see
my
mother
and
he
asked
me
what
was
the
matter
with
me
and
my
mother
answered
for
me
that
i
had
a
bad
head
and
he
looked
at
me
and
as
my
head
was
quite
well
by
this
time
i
could
not
help
feeling
guilty
and
he
saw
my
look
i
suppose
sir
for
i
can
t
account
for
what
he
said
any
other
way
and
he
turned
to
me
and
he
said
to
me
is
your
head
bad
enough
to
send
you
to
the
lord
jesus
to
make
you
whole
i
could
not
speak
a
word
partly
from
bashfulness
i
suppose
for
i
was
but
ten
years
old
so
he
followed
it
up
as
they
say
then
you
ought
to
be
at
school
says
he
i
said
nothing
because
i
couldn
t
but
never
since
then
have
i
given
in
as
long
as
i
could
stand
and
i
can
stand
now
and
lift
my
hammer
too
he
said
as
he
took
the
from
the
forge
laid
it
on
the
anvil
and
again
made
a
nimbus
of
coruscating
iron
you
are
just
the
man
i
want
i
said
i
ve
got
a
job
for
you
down
to
kilkhaven
as
you
say
in
these
what
is
it
sir
something
about
the
church
i
should
ha
thought
the
church
was
all
spick
and
span
by
this
i
see
you
know
who
i
am
i
said
of
course
i
do
he
answered
i
don
t
go
to
church
myself
being
brought
up
a
methodist
but
anything
that
happens
in
the
parish
is
known
the
next
day
all
over
you
won
t
mind
doing
my
job
though
you
are
a
methodist
will
you
i
asked
not
i
sir
if
i
ve
read
right
it
s
the
fault
of
the
church
that
we
don
t
pull
all
alongside
you
turned
us
out
sir
we
didn
t
go
out
of
ourselves
at
least
if
all
they
say
is
true
which
i
can
t
be
sure
of
you
know
in
this
you
are
quite
right
there
though
i
answered
and
in
doing
so
the
church
had
the
worst
of
it
as
all
that
judge
and
punish
their
neighbours
have
but
you
have
been
the
worse
for
it
too
all
of
which
is
to
be
laid
to
the
charge
of
the
church
for
there
is
not
one
clergyman
i
know
mind
i
say
that
i
know
who
would
have
made
such
a
cruel
speech
to
a
boy
as
that
the
methodist
parson
made
to
but
it
did
me
good
sir
are
you
sure
of
that
i
am
not
are
you
sure
first
of
all
it
did
not
make
you
proud
are
you
sure
it
has
not
made
you
work
beyond
your
strength
i
don
t
mean
your
strength
of
arm
for
clearly
that
is
all
that
could
be
wished
but
of
your
chest
your
lungs
is
there
not
some
danger
of
your
leaving
someone
who
is
dependent
on
you
too
soon
unprovided
for
is
there
not
some
danger
of
your
having
worked
as
if
god
were
a
hard
master
of
your
having
worked
fiercely
indignantly
as
if
he
wronged
you
by
not
caring
for
you
not
understanding
you
he
returned
me
no
answer
but
hammered
momently
on
his
anvil
whether
he
felt
what
i
meant
or
was
offended
at
my
remark
i
could
not
then
tell
i
thought
it
best
to
conclude
the
interview
with
business
i
have
a
delicate
little
job
that
wants
nice
handling
and
i
fancy
you
are
just
the
man
to
do
it
to
my
mind
i
said
what
is
it
sir
he
asked
in
a
friendly
manner
enough
if
you
will
excuse
me
i
would
rather
show
it
to
you
than
talk
about
it
i
returned
as
you
please
sir
when
do
you
want
me
the
first
hour
you
can
morning
if
you
feel
for
that
matter
i
d
rather
go
to
come
to
me
instead
it
s
light
i
will
sir
at
ten
o
if
you
and
so
it
was
arranged
chapter
iv
the
the
next
day
rose
glorious
indeed
early
as
the
sun
rose
i
saw
him
rise
saw
him
from
the
down
above
the
house
over
the
land
to
the
east
and
north
ascend
triumphant
into
his
own
light
which
had
prepared
the
way
for
him
while
the
clouds
that
hung
over
the
sea
glowed
out
with
a
faint
flush
as
anticipating
the
hour
when
the
west
should
clasp
the
declining
glory
in
a
richer
though
less
dazzling
splendour
and
shine
out
the
bride
of
the
bridegroom
east
which
behold
each
other
from
afar
across
the
intervening
world
and
never
mingle
but
in
the
sight
of
the
eyes
the
clear
pure
light
of
the
morning
made
me
long
for
the
truth
in
my
heart
which
alone
could
make
me
pure
and
clear
as
the
morning
tune
me
up
to
the
of
the
nature
around
me
and
the
wind
that
blew
from
the
sunrise
made
me
hope
in
the
god
who
had
first
breathed
into
my
nostrils
the
breath
of
life
that
he
would
at
length
so
fill
me
with
his
breath
his
wind
his
spirit
that
i
should
think
only
his
thoughts
and
live
his
life
finding
therein
my
own
life
only
glorified
infinitely
after
breakfast
and
prayers
i
would
go
to
the
church
to
await
the
arrival
of
my
new
acquaintance
the
smith
in
order
to
obtain
entrance
i
had
however
to
go
to
the
cottage
of
the
sexton
this
was
not
my
first
visit
there
so
that
i
may
now
venture
to
take
my
reader
with
me
to
reach
the
door
i
had
to
cross
a
hollow
by
a
bridge
built
for
the
sake
of
the
road
over
what
had
once
been
the
course
of
a
rivulet
from
the
heights
above
now
it
was
a
kind
of
little
glen
or
what
would
in
scotland
be
called
a
den
i
think
grown
with
grass
and
wild
flowers
and
ferns
some
of
them
rare
and
fine
the
roof
of
the
cottage
came
down
to
the
road
and
until
you
came
quite
near
you
could
not
but
wonder
where
the
body
that
supported
this
head
could
be
but
you
soon
saw
that
the
ground
fell
suddenly
away
leaving
a
bank
against
which
the
cottage
was
built
crossing
a
garden
of
the
smallest
the
principal
flowers
of
which
were
the
stonecrop
on
its
walls
by
a
path
you
entered
the
building
and
to
your
surprise
found
yourself
not
in
a
little
cottage
kitchen
as
you
expected
but
in
a
space
that
seemed
to
have
forgotten
the
use
for
which
it
had
been
built
there
was
a
sort
of
loft
along
one
side
of
it
and
it
was
heaped
with
indescribable
stuff
with
here
and
there
a
hint
at
possible
machinery
the
place
had
been
a
mill
for
grinding
corn
and
its
wheel
had
been
driven
by
the
stream
which
had
run
for
ages
in
the
hollow
of
which
i
have
already
spoken
but
when
the
canal
came
to
be
constructed
the
stream
had
to
be
turned
aside
from
its
former
course
and
indeed
was
now
employed
upon
occasion
to
feed
the
canal
so
that
the
mill
of
necessity
had
fallen
into
disuse
and
decay
crossing
this
floor
you
entered
another
door
and
turning
sharp
to
the
left
went
down
a
few
steps
of
a
of
stair
and
after
knocking
your
hat
against
a
beam
emerged
in
the
comfortable
quaint
little
cottage
kitchen
you
had
expected
earlier
a
cheerful
though
small
fire
burns
in
the
grate
for
even
here
the
has
vanished
from
the
records
of
and
is
pleasant
here
even
in
the
height
of
summer
though
it
is
counted
needful
only
for
cooking
purposes
the
ceiling
which
consists
only
of
the
joists
and
the
boards
that
floor
the
bedroom
above
is
so
low
that
necessity
if
not
politeness
would
compel
you
to
take
off
your
hat
some
of
these
joists
you
will
find
are
made
further
useful
by
supporting
each
a
shelf
before
which
hangs
a
little
curtain
of
printed
cotton
concealing
the
few
stores
and
postponed
eatables
of
the
house
forming
in
fact
both
and
larder
of
the
family
on
the
walls
hang
several
coloured
prints
and
within
a
deep
glazed
frame
the
figure
of
a
ship
in
full
dress
carved
in
rather
high
relief
in
sycamore
as
i
now
entered
coombes
rose
from
a
settle
near
the
fire
and
bade
me
with
a
courtesy
what
a
lovely
day
it
is
coombes
it
is
so
bright
over
the
sea
i
said
going
to
the
one
little
window
which
looked
out
on
the
great
atlantic
that
one
almost
expects
a
great
merchant
navy
to
come
sailing
into
kilkhaven
sunk
to
the
water
s
edge
with
silks
and
ivory
and
spices
and
apes
and
peacocks
like
the
ships
of
solomon
that
we
read
about
just
as
the
sun
gets
up
to
the
before
i
record
her
answer
i
turn
to
my
reader
who
in
the
spirit
accompanies
me
and
have
a
little
talk
with
him
i
always
make
it
a
rule
to
speak
freely
with
the
less
as
with
the
more
educated
of
my
friends
i
never
to
them
except
i
be
expressly
explaining
something
to
them
the
law
of
the
world
is
as
the
law
of
the
family
those
children
grow
much
the
faster
who
hear
all
that
is
going
on
in
the
house
reaching
ever
above
themselves
they
arrive
at
an
understanding
at
fifteen
which
in
the
usual
way
of
things
they
would
not
reach
before
or
thirty
and
this
in
a
natural
way
and
without
any
necessary
priggishness
except
such
as
may
belong
to
their
parents
therefore
i
always
spoke
to
the
poor
and
uneducated
as
to
my
own
people
freely
not
much
caring
whether
i
should
be
quite
understood
or
not
for
i
believed
in
influences
not
to
be
measured
by
the
measure
of
the
understanding
but
what
was
the
old
woman
s
answer
it
was
this
i
know
sir
and
when
i
was
as
young
as
you
i
was
not
so
very
young
my
reader
may
well
think
i
thought
like
that
about
the
sea
myself
everything
come
from
the
sea
for
my
boy
willie
he
du
bring
me
home
the
beautifullest
parrot
and
the
talkingest
you
ever
see
and
the
red
shawl
all
worked
over
with
flowers
i
ll
show
it
to
you
some
day
sir
when
you
have
time
he
made
that
ship
you
see
in
the
frame
there
sir
all
with
his
own
knife
out
on
a
bit
o
wood
that
he
got
at
the
marishes
as
they
calls
it
sir
a
bit
of
an
island
somewheres
in
the
great
sea
but
the
parrot
s
gone
dead
like
the
rest
of
them
where
am
i
and
what
am
i
talking
about
she
added
looking
down
at
her
knitting
as
if
she
had
dropped
a
stitch
or
rather
as
if
she
had
forgotten
what
she
was
making
and
therefore
what
was
to
come
next
you
were
telling
me
how
you
used
to
think
of
the
sea
when
i
was
as
young
as
you
i
remember
sir
well
that
lasted
a
long
time
lasted
till
my
third
boy
fell
asleep
in
the
wide
water
for
it
du
call
it
falling
asleep
don
t
it
sir
the
bible
certainly
does
i
answered
it
s
the
bible
i
be
meaning
of
course
she
returned
well
after
that
but
i
don
t
know
what
began
it
only
i
did
begin
to
think
about
the
sea
as
something
that
took
away
things
and
didn
t
bring
them
no
more
and
somehow
or
other
she
never
look
so
blue
after
that
and
she
give
me
the
shivers
but
now
sir
she
always
looks
to
me
like
one
o
the
shining
ones
that
come
to
fetch
the
pilgrims
you
ve
heard
tell
of
the
s
i
daresay
sir
among
the
poor
people
for
they
du
say
it
was
written
by
a
tinker
though
there
be
a
power
o
good
things
in
it
that
i
think
the
gentlefolk
would
like
if
they
knowed
i
do
know
the
book
nearly
as
well
as
i
know
the
bible
i
answered
and
the
shining
ones
are
very
beautiful
in
it
i
am
glad
you
can
think
of
the
sea
that
it
s
looking
in
at
the
window
all
day
as
i
go
about
the
house
she
answered
and
all
night
too
when
i
m
asleep
and
if
i
hadn
t
learned
to
think
of
it
that
way
it
would
have
driven
me
mad
i
du
believe
i
was
forced
to
think
that
way
about
it
or
not
think
at
all
and
that
wouldn
t
be
easy
with
the
sound
of
it
in
your
ears
the
last
thing
at
night
and
the
first
thing
in
the
the
truth
of
things
is
indeed
the
only
refuge
from
the
look
of
things
i
replied
but
now
i
want
the
key
of
the
church
if
you
will
trust
me
with
it
for
i
have
something
to
do
there
this
morning
and
the
key
of
the
tower
as
well
if
you
with
her
old
smile
ripened
only
by
age
she
reached
the
ponderous
keys
from
the
nail
where
they
hung
and
gave
them
into
my
hand
i
left
her
in
the
shadow
of
her
dwelling
and
stepped
forth
into
the
sunlight
the
first
thing
i
observed
was
the
blacksmith
waiting
for
me
at
the
church
door
now
that
i
saw
him
in
the
full
light
of
day
and
now
that
he
wore
his
morning
face
upon
which
the
blackness
of
labour
had
not
yet
gathered
i
could
see
more
plainly
how
far
he
was
from
well
there
was
a
flush
on
his
thin
cheek
by
which
the
less
used
exercise
of
walking
revealed
his
inward
weakness
and
the
light
in
his
eyes
had
something
of
the
in
them
the
light
that
never
was
on
sea
or
but
his
speech
was
cheerful
for
he
had
been
walking
in
the
light
of
this
world
and
that
had
done
something
to
make
the
light
within
him
shine
a
little
more
freely
how
do
you
find
yourself
i
asked
quite
well
sir
i
thank
you
he
answered
a
day
like
this
does
a
man
good
but
he
added
and
his
countenance
fell
the
heart
knoweth
its
own
it
may
know
it
too
much
i
returned
just
because
it
refuses
to
let
a
stranger
intermeddle
he
made
no
reply
i
turned
the
key
in
the
great
lock
and
the
oak
opened
and
let
us
into
the
solemn
gloom
it
did
not
require
many
minutes
to
make
the
man
understand
what
i
wanted
of
him
we
must
begin
at
the
bells
and
work
down
he
said
so
we
went
up
into
the
tower
where
with
the
help
of
a
candle
i
fetched
for
him
from
the
cottage
he
made
a
good
many
minute
measurements
found
that
carpenter
s
work
was
necessary
for
the
adjustment
of
the
hammers
and
cranks
and
the
leading
of
the
rods
undertook
the
management
of
the
whole
and
in
the
course
of
an
hour
and
a
half
went
home
to
do
what
had
to
be
done
before
any
fixing
could
be
commenced
assuring
me
that
he
had
no
doubt
of
bringing
the
job
to
a
satisfactory
conclusion
although
the
force
of
the
blow
on
the
bell
would
doubtless
have
to
be
regulated
afterwards
by
repeated
trials
in
a
fortnight
i
hope
you
will
be
able
to
play
a
tune
to
the
parish
sir
he
added
as
he
took
his
leave
i
resolved
if
possible
to
know
more
of
the
man
and
find
out
his
trouble
if
haply
i
might
be
able
to
give
him
any
comfort
for
i
was
all
but
certain
that
there
was
a
deeper
cause
for
his
gloom
than
the
state
of
his
health
when
he
was
gone
i
stood
with
the
key
of
the
church
in
my
hand
and
looked
about
me
nature
at
least
was
in
glorious
health
sunshine
in
her
eyes
light
fantastic
passing
through
her
brain
her
breath
coming
and
going
in
soft
breezes
perfumed
with
the
scents
of
meadows
and
wild
flowers
and
her
green
robe
shining
in
the
motions
of
her
gladness
i
turned
to
lock
the
church
door
though
in
my
heart
i
greatly
disapproved
of
locking
the
doors
of
churches
and
only
did
so
now
because
it
was
not
my
church
and
i
had
no
business
to
force
my
opinions
upon
other
customs
but
when
i
turned
i
received
a
kind
of
questioning
shock
there
was
the
fallen
world
as
men
call
it
shining
in
glory
and
gladness
because
god
was
there
here
was
the
way
into
the
lost
paradise
yea
the
door
into
an
infinitely
higher
eden
than
that
ever
had
or
ever
could
have
been
and
riveted
gloomy
and
like
the
entrance
to
a
sepulchre
and
surrounded
with
the
grim
heads
of
grotesque
monsters
of
the
deep
what
did
it
mean
here
was
contrast
enough
to
require
harmonising
or
if
that
might
not
be
then
accounting
for
perhaps
it
was
enough
to
say
that
although
god
made
both
the
kingdom
of
nature
and
the
kingdom
of
grace
yet
the
symbol
of
the
latter
was
the
work
of
man
and
might
not
altogether
correspond
to
god
s
idea
of
the
matter
i
turned
away
thoughtful
and
went
through
the
churchyard
with
my
eye
on
the
graves
as
i
left
the
churchyard
still
looking
to
the
earth
the
sound
of
voices
reached
my
ear
i
looked
up
there
down
below
me
at
the
foot
of
the
high
bank
on
which
i
stood
lay
a
gorgeous
shining
thing
upon
the
bosom
of
the
canal
full
of
men
and
surrounded
by
men
women
and
children
delighting
in
its
beauty
i
had
never
seen
such
a
thing
before
but
i
knew
at
once
as
by
instinct
which
of
course
it
could
not
have
been
that
it
was
the
but
in
its
gorgeous
colours
red
and
white
and
green
it
looked
more
like
the
galley
that
bore
cleopatra
to
actium
nor
floating
so
light
on
the
top
of
the
water
and
broad
in
the
beam
withal
curved
upward
and
ornamented
at
stern
and
stem
did
it
look
at
all
like
a
creature
formed
to
battle
with
the
fierce
elements
a
for
floating
between
river
banks
it
seemed
drawn
by
swans
mayhap
and
regarded
in
its
course
by
fair
eyes
from
green
or
oriel
windows
of
ancient
houses
on
verdant
lawns
ten
men
sat
on
the
thwarts
and
one
in
the
stern
by
the
yet
useless
rudder
while
men
and
boys
drew
the
showy
thing
by
a
rope
downward
to
the
the
men
in
the
boat
wore
blue
jerseys
but
you
could
see
little
of
the
colour
for
strange
unshapely
things
that
they
wore
above
them
like
an
armour
cut
out
of
a
row
of
organ
pipes
they
were
their
for
every
man
had
to
be
made
into
a
himself
i
descended
the
bank
and
stood
on
the
edge
of
the
canal
as
it
drew
near
then
i
saw
that
every
oar
was
loosely
but
firmly
fastened
to
the
rowlock
so
that
it
could
be
dropped
and
caught
again
in
a
moment
and
that
the
gay
sides
of
the
creature
were
festooned
with
ropes
from
the
gunwale
for
the
men
to
lay
hold
of
when
she
capsized
for
the
earlier
custom
of
fastening
the
men
to
their
seats
had
been
quite
given
up
because
their
weight
under
the
water
might
prevent
the
boat
from
righting
itself
again
and
the
men
could
not
come
to
the
surface
now
they
had
a
better
chance
in
their
freedom
though
why
they
should
not
be
loosely
attached
to
the
boat
i
do
not
quite
see
they
towed
the
shining
thing
through
the
upper
gate
of
the
lock
and
slowly
she
sank
from
my
sight
and
for
some
moments
was
no
more
to
be
seen
for
i
had
remained
standing
where
first
she
passed
me
all
at
once
there
she
was
beyond
the
covert
of
the
abroad
and
free
fleeting
from
the
strokes
of
ten
swift
oars
over
the
still
waters
of
the
bay
towards
the
waves
that
roared
further
out
where
the
was
broken
by
the
rise
of
the
sandy
coast
there
was
no
vessel
in
danger
now
as
the
talk
of
the
spectators
informed
me
it
was
only
for
exercise
and
show
that
they
went
out
it
seemed
all
child
s
play
for
a
time
but
when
they
got
among
the
broken
waves
then
it
looked
quite
another
thing
the
motion
of
the
waters
laid
hold
upon
her
and
soon
tossed
her
fearfully
now
revealing
the
whole
of
her
capacity
on
the
near
side
of
one
of
their
slopes
now
hiding
her
whole
bulk
in
one
of
their
hollows
beyond
she
careless
as
a
child
in
the
troubles
of
the
world
floated
about
amongst
them
with
what
appeared
too
much
buoyancy
for
the
promise
of
a
safe
return
again
and
again
she
was
driven
from
her
course
towards
the
low
rocks
on
the
other
side
of
the
bay
and
again
and
again
returned
to
disport
herself
like
a
as
it
seemed
upon
the
backs
of
the
wild
rolling
and
bursting
billows
can
she
go
no
further
i
asked
of
the
captain
of
the
coastguard
whom
i
found
standing
by
my
side
not
without
some
danger
he
answered
what
then
must
it
be
in
a
storm
i
remarked
then
of
course
he
returned
they
must
take
their
chance
but
there
is
no
good
in
running
risks
for
nothing
that
swell
is
quite
enough
for
but
is
it
enough
to
accustom
them
to
face
the
danger
that
will
come
i
asked
with
danger
comes
courage
said
the
old
sailor
were
you
ever
afraid
no
sir
i
don
t
think
i
ever
was
afraid
yes
i
believe
i
was
once
for
one
moment
no
more
when
i
fell
from
the
yard
and
felt
myself
falling
but
it
was
soon
over
for
i
only
fell
into
the
maintop
i
was
expecting
the
smash
on
deck
when
i
was
brought
up
there
but
he
resumed
i
don
t
care
much
about
the
my
rockets
are
worth
a
good
deal
more
as
you
may
see
sir
before
the
winter
is
over
for
seldom
does
a
winter
pass
without
at
least
two
or
three
wrecks
close
by
here
on
this
coast
the
full
force
of
the
atlantic
breaks
here
sir
i
seen
a
not
that
one
done
nothing
yet
pitched
stern
over
stem
not
capsized
you
know
sir
in
the
ordinary
way
but
struck
by
a
wave
behind
while
she
was
just
hanging
in
the
balance
on
the
of
a
wave
and
flung
a
somerset
as
i
say
stern
over
stem
and
four
of
her
men
while
we
spoke
i
saw
on
the
the
tall
figure
of
the
painter
looking
earnestly
at
the
boat
i
thought
he
was
regarding
it
chiefly
from
an
artistic
point
of
view
but
i
became
aware
before
long
that
that
would
not
have
been
consistent
with
the
character
of
charles
percivale
he
had
been
i
learned
afterwards
a
crack
oarsman
at
oxford
and
had
belonged
to
the
university
boat
so
that
he
had
some
almost
with
the
doings
of
the
crew
in
a
little
while
the
boat
sped
swiftly
back
entered
the
lock
was
lifted
above
the
level
of
the
ocean
and
floated
up
the
smooth
canal
calmly
as
if
she
had
never
known
what
trouble
was
away
up
to
the
pretty
little
house
in
which
she
lay
one
could
almost
fancy
dreaming
of
storms
to
come
she
went
as
softly
as
if
moved
only
by
her
own
sweet
will
in
the
calm
consolation
for
her
imprisonment
of
having
tried
her
strength
and
found
therein
good
hope
of
success
for
the
time
when
she
should
rush
to
the
rescue
of
men
from
that
to
which
as
a
monster
that
begets
monsters
she
a
watching
perseis
lay
ready
to
offer
battle
the
poor
little
boat
lying
in
her
little
house
watching
the
ocean
was
something
signified
in
my
eyes
and
not
less
so
after
what
came
in
the
course
of
changing
seasons
and
gathered
storms
all
this
time
i
had
the
keys
in
my
hand
and
now
went
back
to
the
cottage
to
restore
them
to
their
place
upon
the
wall
when
i
entered
there
was
a
young
woman
of
a
sweet
interesting
countenance
talking
to
coombes
now
as
it
happened
i
had
never
yet
seen
the
daughter
who
lived
with
her
and
thought
this
was
she
i
ve
found
your
daughter
at
last
then
i
said
approaching
them
not
yet

goes
out
to
work
and
her
hands
be
pretty
full
at
present
but
this
be
almost
my
daughter

she
added
this
is
my
next
daughter
mary
trehern
from
the
south
she
s
got
a
place
near
by
to
be
near
her
mother
that
is
to
be
that
s
mary
was
hanging
her
head
and
blushing
as
the
old
woman
spoke
i
understand
i
said
and
when
are
you
going
to
get
your
new
mother
mary
soon
i
but
she
gave
me
no
reply
only
hung
her
head
lower
and
blushed
deeper
coombes
spoke
for
her
she
s
shy
you
see
sir
but
if
she
was
to
speak
her
mind
she
would
ask
you
whether
you
wouldn
t
marry
her
and
willie
when
he
comes
home
from
his
next
mary
s
hands
were
trembling
now
and
she
turned
half
away
with
all
my
heart
i
said
the
girl
tried
to
turn
towards
me
but
could
not
i
looked
at
her
face
a
little
more
closely
through
all
its
tremor
there
was
a
look
of
constancy
that
greatly
pleased
me
i
tried
to
make
her
speak
when
do
you
expect
willie
home
i
said
she
made
a
little
gasp
and
murmur
but
no
articulate
words
came
don
t
be
frightened
mary
said
her
mother
as
i
found
she
always
called
her
the
gentleman
won
t
be
sharp
with
she
lifted
a
pair
of
soft
brown
eyes
with
one
glance
and
a
smile
and
then
sank
them
again
he
ll
be
home
in
about
a
month
we
think
answered
the
mother
she
s
a
good
ship
he
s
aboard
of
and
makes
good
it
is
time
to
think
about
the
bans
then
i
said
if
you
please
sir
said
the
mother
just
come
to
me
about
it
and
i
will
attend
to
it
when
you
think
i
thought
i
could
hear
a
murmured
thank
you
sir
from
the
girl
but
i
could
not
be
certain
that
she
spoke
i
shook
hands
with
them
and
went
for
a
stroll
on
the
other
side
of
the
bay
chapter
percivale
when
i
reached
home
i
found
that
connie
was
already
on
her
for
while
i
was
away
they
had
carried
her
out
that
she
might
see
the
i
followed
her
and
found
the
whole
family
about
her
couch
and
with
them
percivale
who
was
showing
her
some
sketches
that
he
had
made
in
the
neighbourhood
connie
knew
nothing
of
drawing
but
she
seemed
to
me
always
to
catch
the
feeling
of
a
thing
her
remarks
therefore
were
generally
worth
listening
to
and
percivale
was
evidently
interested
in
them
wynnie
stood
behind
connie
looking
over
her
shoulder
at
the
drawing
in
her
hand
how
do
you
get
that
shade
of
green
i
heard
her
ask
as
i
came
up
and
then
percivale
proceeded
to
tell
her
from
which
beginning
they
went
on
to
other
things
till
percivale
said
but
it
is
hardly
fair
miss
walton
to
criticise
my
work
while
you
keep
your
own
under
i
wasn
t
criticising
percivale
was
i
connie
i
didn
t
hear
her
make
a
single
remark
percivale
said
connie
taking
her
sister
s
side
to
my
surprise
they
were
talking
away
with
the
young
man
as
if
they
had
known
him
for
years
and
my
wife
was
seated
at
the
foot
of
the
couch
apparently
taking
no
exception
to
the
suddenness
of
the
intimacy
i
am
afraid
when
i
think
of
it
that
a
good
many
springs
would
be
missing
from
the
world
s
history
if
they
might
not
flow
till
the
papas
gave
their
wise
consideration
to
everything
about
the
course
they
were
to
take
i
think
though
added
connie
it
is
only
fair
that
percivale
see
your
work
then
i
will
fetch
my
portfolio
if
percivale
will
promise
to
remember
that
i
have
no
opinion
of
it
at
the
same
time
if
i
could
do
what
i
wanted
to
do
i
think
i
should
not
be
ashamed
of
showing
my
drawings
even
to
and
now
i
was
surprised
to
find
how
like
grown
women
my
daughters
could
talk
to
me
they
always
spoke
like
the
children
they
were
but
when
i
heard
them
now
it
seemed
as
if
they
had
started
all
at
once
into
ladies
experienced
in
the
ways
of
society
there
they
were
chatting
lightly
airily
and
yet
decidedly
a
slight
tone
of
badinage
interwoven
with
a
young
man
of
grace
and
dignity
whom
they
had
only
seen
once
before
and
who
had
advanced
no
farther
with
connie
at
least
than
a
stately
bow
they
had
however
been
a
whole
hour
together
before
i
arrived
and
their
mother
had
been
with
them
all
the
while
which
gives
great
courage
to
good
girls
while
i
am
told
it
shuts
the
mouths
of
those
who
are
sly
but
then
it
must
be
remembered
that
there
are
as
great
differences
in
mothers
as
in
girls
and
besides
i
believe
wise
girls
have
an
instinct
about
men
that
all
the
experience
of
other
men
can
not
overtake
but
yet
again
there
are
many
girls
foolish
enough
to
mistake
a
mere
impulse
for
instinct
and
vanity
for
insight
as
wynnie
spoke
she
turned
and
went
back
to
the
house
to
fetch
some
of
her
work
now
had
she
been
going
a
message
for
me
she
would
have
gone
like
the
wind
but
on
this
occasion
she
stepped
along
in
a
stately
manner
far
from
devoid
of
grace
but
equally
free
from
frolic
or
eagerness
and
i
could
not
help
noting
as
well
that
percivale
s
eyes
followed
her
what
i
felt
or
fancied
is
of
no
consequence
to
anybody
i
do
not
think
even
if
i
were
writing
an
autobiography
i
should
be
forced
to
tell
about
myself
but
an
autobiography
is
further
from
my
fancy
however
much
i
may
have
trenched
upon
its
limits
than
any
other
form
of
literature
with
which
i
am
acquainted
she
was
not
long
in
returning
however
though
she
came
back
with
the
same
dignified
motion
there
is
nothing
really
worth
either
showing
or
concealing
she
said
to
percivale
as
she
handed
him
the
portfolio
to
help
himself
as
it
were
she
then
turned
away
as
if
a
little
feeling
of
shyness
had
come
over
her
and
began
to
look
for
something
to
do
about
connie
i
could
see
that
although
she
had
hitherto
been
almost
indifferent
about
the
merit
of
her
drawings
she
had
a
wish
that
they
might
not
appear
altogether
contemptible
in
the
eyes
of
percivale
and
i
saw
too
that
connie
s
wide
eyes
were
taking
in
everything
it
was
wonderful
how
connie
s
deprivations
had
made
her
keen
in
observing
now
she
hastened
to
her
sister
s
rescue
even
from
such
a
slight
inconvenience
as
the
shadow
of
embarrassment
in
which
she
found
herself
perhaps
from
having
seen
some
unusual
expression
in
my
face
of
which
i
was
unconscious
though
conscious
enough
of
what
might
have
occasioned
such
give
me
your
hand
wynnie
said
connie
and
help
me
to
move
one
inch
further
on
my
i
may
move
just
that
much
on
my
side
mayn
t
i
papa
i
think
you
had
better
not
my
dear
if
you
can
do
without
it
i
answered
for
the
doctor
s
injunctions
had
been
strong
very
well
papa
but
i
feel
as
if
it
would
do
me
mr
turner
will
be
here
next
week
you
know
and
you
must
try
to
stick
to
his
rules
till
he
comes
to
see
you
perhaps
he
will
let
you
relax
a
connie
smiled
very
sweetly
and
lay
still
while
wynnie
stood
holding
her
hand
meantime
percivale
having
received
the
drawings
had
walked
away
with
them
towards
what
they
called
the
storm
tower
a
little
building
standing
square
to
the
points
of
the
compass
from
little
windows
in
which
the
coastguard
could
see
with
their
telescopes
along
the
coast
on
both
sides
and
far
out
to
sea
this
tower
stood
on
the
very
edge
of
the
cliff
but
behind
it
there
was
a
steep
descent
to
reach
which
apparently
he
went
round
the
tower
and
disappeared
he
evidently
wanted
to
make
a
leisurely
examination
of
the
drawings
somewhat
formidable
for
wynnie
i
thought
at
the
same
time
it
impressed
me
favourably
with
regard
to
the
young
man
that
he
was
not
inclined
to
pay
a
set
of
stupid
and
untrue
compliments
the
instant
the
portfolio
was
opened
but
on
the
contrary
in
order
to
speak
what
was
real
about
them
would
take
the
trouble
to
make
himself
in
some
adequate
measure
acquainted
with
them
i
therefore
to
wynnie
s
relief
i
fear
strolled
after
him
seeing
no
harm
in
taking
a
peep
at
his
person
while
he
was
taking
a
peep
at
my
daughter
s
mind
i
went
round
the
tower
to
the
other
side
and
there
saw
him
at
a
little
distance
below
me
but
further
out
on
a
great
rock
that
overhung
the
sea
connected
with
the
cliff
by
a
long
narrow
isthmus
a
few
yards
lower
than
the
cliff
itself
only
just
broad
enough
to
admit
of
a
footpath
along
its
top
and
on
one
side
going
sheer
down
with
a
smooth
hard
to
the
sands
below
the
other
side
was
less
steep
and
had
some
grass
upon
it
but
the
path
was
too
narrow
and
the
precipice
too
steep
for
me
to
trust
my
head
with
the
business
of
guiding
my
feet
along
it
so
i
stood
and
saw
him
from
the
mainland
saw
his
head
at
least
bent
over
the
drawings
saw
how
slowly
he
turned
from
one
to
the
other
saw
how
after
having
gone
over
them
once
he
turned
to
the
beginning
and
went
over
them
again
even
more
slowly
than
before
saw
how
he
turned
the
third
time
to
the
first
then
getting
tired
i
went
back
to
the
group
on
the
down
caught
sight
of
charlie
and
harry
turning
heels
over
head
down
the
slope
toward
the
house
found
that
my
wife
had
gone
home
in
fact
that
only
connie
and
wynnie
were
left
the
sun
had
disappeared
under
a
cloud
and
the
sea
had
turned
a
little
slaty
the
yellow
flowers
in
the
short
no
longer
caught
the
eye
with
their
gold
and
the
wind
that
bent
their
tops
had
just
the
suspicion
of
an
edge
in
it
and
wynnie
s
face
looked
a
little
cloudy
too
i
thought
and
i
feared
that
it
was
my
fault
i
fancied
there
was
just
a
tinge
of
beseeching
in
connie
s
eye
as
i
looked
at
her
thinking
there
might
be
danger
for
her
in
the
sunlessness
of
the
wind
but
i
do
not
know
that
all
this
even
the
clouding
of
the
sun
may
not
have
come
out
of
my
own
mind
the
result
of
my
not
being
quite
satisfied
with
myself
because
of
the
mood
i
had
been
in
my
feeling
had
altered
considerably
in
the
mean
time
run
wynnie
and
ask
percivale
with
my
compliments
to
come
and
lunch
with
us
i
said
more
to
let
her
see
i
was
not
displeased
however
i
might
have
looked
than
for
any
other
reason
she
went
sedately
as
before
almost
as
soon
as
she
was
gone
i
saw
that
i
had
put
her
in
a
difficulty
for
i
had
discovered
very
soon
after
coming
into
these
parts
that
her
head
was
no
more
steady
than
my
own
on
high
places
for
she
up
had
never
been
used
to
such
in
our
own
level
country
except
indeed
on
the
stair
that
led
down
to
the
old
quarry
and
the
well
where
i
can
remember
now
she
always
laid
her
hand
on
the
balustrade
with
some
degree
of
tremor
although
she
had
been
in
the
way
of
going
up
and
down
from
childhood
but
if
she
could
not
cross
that
narrow
and
really
dangerous
isthmus
still
less
could
she
call
to
a
man
she
had
never
seen
but
once
across
the
intervening
chasm
i
therefore
set
off
after
her
leaving
connie
lying
there
in
loneliness
between
the
sea
and
the
sky
but
when
i
got
to
the
other
side
of
the
little
tower
instead
of
finding
her
standing
hesitating
on
the
brink
of
action
there
she
was
on
the
rock
beyond
percivale
had
risen
and
was
evidently
giving
an
answer
to
my
invitation
at
least
the
next
moment
she
turned
to
come
back
and
he
followed
i
stood
trembling
almost
to
see
her
cross
the
of
that
ledge
if
i
had
not
been
almost
fascinated
i
should
have
turned
and
left
them
to
come
together
lest
the
evil
fancy
should
cross
her
mind
that
i
was
watching
them
for
it
was
one
thing
to
watch
him
with
her
drawings
and
quite
another
to
watch
him
with
herself
but
i
stood
and
stared
as
she
crossed
in
the
middle
of
the
path
however
up
to
which
point
she
had
been
walking
with
perfect
steadiness
and
composure
she
lifted
her
eyes
by
what
influence
i
can
not
tell
saw
me
looked
as
if
she
saw
ghost
half
lifted
her
arms
swayed
as
if
she
would
fall
and
indeed
was
falling
over
the
precipice
when
percivale
who
was
close
behind
her
caught
her
in
his
arms
almost
too
late
for
both
of
them
so
nearly
down
was
she
already
that
her
weight
bent
him
over
the
rocky
side
till
it
seemed
as
if
he
must
yield
or
his
body
snap
for
he
bent
from
the
waist
and
looked
as
if
his
feet
only
kept
a
hold
on
the
ground
it
was
all
over
in
a
moment
but
in
that
moment
it
made
a
on
my
brain
which
returns
ever
and
again
with
such
vivid
agony
that
i
can
not
hope
to
get
rid
of
it
till
i
get
rid
of
the
brain
itself
in
which
lies
the
impress
in
another
moment
they
were
at
my
side
she
with
a
wan
terrified
smile
he
in
a
ruddy
alarm
i
was
unable
to
speak
and
could
only
with
trembling
steps
lead
the
way
from
the
dreadful
spot
i
reproached
myself
afterwards
for
my
want
of
faith
in
god
but
i
had
not
had
time
to
correct
myself
yet
without
a
word
on
their
side
either
they
followed
me
before
we
reached
connie
i
recovered
myself
sufficiently
to
say
not
a
word
to
connie
and
they
understood
me
i
told
wynnie
to
run
to
the
house
and
send
walter
to
help
me
to
carry
connie
home
she
went
and
until
walter
came
i
talked
to
percivale
as
if
nothing
had
happened
and
what
made
me
feel
yet
more
friendly
towards
him
was
that
he
did
not
do
as
some
young
men
wishing
to
ingratiate
themselves
would
have
done
he
did
not
offer
to
help
me
to
carry
connie
home
i
saw
that
the
offer
rose
in
his
mind
and
that
he
repressed
it
he
understood
that
i
must
consider
such
a
permission
as
a
privilege
not
to
be
accorded
to
the
acquaintance
of
a
day
that
i
must
know
him
better
before
i
could
allow
the
weight
of
my
child
to
rest
on
his
strength
i
was
even
grateful
to
him
for
this
knowledge
of
human
nature
but
he
responded
cordially
to
my
invitation
to
lunch
with
us
and
walked
by
my
side
as
walter
and
i
bore
the
precious
burden
home
during
our
meal
he
made
himself
quite
agreeable
talked
well
on
the
topics
of
the
day
not
altogether
as
a
man
who
had
made
up
his
mind
but
not
the
less
rather
the
more
as
a
man
who
had
thought
about
them
and
one
who
did
not
find
it
so
easy
to
come
to
a
conclusion
as
most
people
do
or
possibly
as
not
feeling
the
necessity
of
coming
to
a
conclusion
and
therefore
preferring
to
allow
the
conclusion
to
grow
instead
of
constructing
one
for
immediate
use
this
i
rather
liked
than
otherwise
his
behaviour
i
need
hardly
say
after
what
i
have
told
of
him
already
was
entirely
that
of
a
gentleman
and
his
education
was
good
but
what
i
did
not
like
was
that
as
often
as
the
conversation
made
a
bend
in
the
direction
of
religious
matters
he
was
sure
to
bend
it
away
in
some
other
direction
as
soon
as
ever
he
laid
his
next
hold
upon
it
this
however
might
have
various
reasons
to
account
for
it
and
i
would
wait
after
lunch
as
we
rose
from
the
table
he
took
wynnie
s
portfolio
from
the
where
he
had
laid
it
and
with
no
more
than
a
bow
and
thanks
returned
it
to
her
she
i
thought
looked
a
little
disappointed
though
she
said
as
lightly
as
she
could
i
am
afraid
you
have
not
found
anything
worthy
of
criticism
in
my
poor
attempts
percivale
on
the
contrary
i
shall
be
most
happy
to
tell
you
what
i
think
of
them
if
you
would
like
to
hear
the
impression
they
have
made
upon
me
he
replied
holding
out
his
hand
to
take
the
portfolio
again
i
shall
be
greatly
obliged
to
you
she
said
returning
it
for
i
have
had
no
one
to
help
me
since
i
left
school
except
a
book
called
which
i
think
has
the
most
beautiful
things
in
it
i
ever
read
but
which
i
lay
down
every
now
and
then
with
a
kind
of
despair
as
if
i
never
could
do
anything
worth
doing
how
long
the
next
volume
is
in
coming
do
you
know
the
author
percivale
i
wish
i
did
he
has
given
me
much
help
i
do
not
say
i
can
agree
with
everything
he
writes
but
when
i
do
not
i
have
such
a
respect
for
him
that
i
always
feel
as
if
he
must
be
right
whether
he
seems
to
me
to
be
right
or
not
and
if
he
is
severe
it
is
with
the
severity
of
love
that
will
speak
only
the
this
last
speech
fell
on
my
ear
like
the
tone
of
a
church
bell
that
will
do
my
friend
thought
i
but
i
said
nothing
to
interrupt
by
this
time
he
had
laid
the
portfolio
open
on
the
and
placed
a
chair
in
front
of
it
for
my
daughter
then
seating
himself
by
her
side
but
without
the
least
approach
to
familiarity
he
began
to
talk
to
her
about
her
drawings
praising
in
general
the
feeling
but
finding
fault
with
the
want
of
nicety
in
the
execution
at
least
so
it
appeared
to
me
from
what
i
could
understand
of
the
conversation
but
said
my
daughter
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
get
the
feeling
right
that
is
the
main
no
doubt
returned
percivale
so
much
the
main
thing
that
any
imperfection
or
coarseness
or
untruth
which
interferes
with
it
becomes
of
the
greatest
but
can
it
really
interfere
with
the
feeling
perhaps
not
with
most
people
simply
because
most
people
observe
so
badly
that
their
recollections
of
nature
are
all
blurred
and
blotted
and
indistinct
and
therefore
the
imperfections
we
are
speaking
of
do
not
affect
them
but
with
the
more
cultivated
it
is
otherwise
it
is
for
them
you
ought
to
work
for
you
do
not
thereby
lose
the
others
besides
the
feeling
is
always
intensified
by
the
finish
for
that
belongs
to
the
feeling
too
and
must
i
should
think
have
some
influence
even
where
it
is
not
but
is
it
not
a
hopeless
thing
to
attempt
the
finish
of
nature
not
at
all
to
the
degree
that
is
in
which
you
can
represent
anything
else
of
nature
but
in
this
drawing
now
you
have
no
representative
of
nothing
to
hint
at
or
recall
the
feeling
of
the
exquisiteness
of
nature
s
finish
why
should
you
not
at
least
have
drawn
a
true
there
has
the
absolute
truth
of
the
meeting
of
sea
and
sky
nothing
to
do
with
the
feeling
which
such
a
landscape
produces
i
should
have
thought
you
would
have
learned
that
if
anything
from
percivale
spoke
earnestly
wynnie
either
from
disappointment
or
despair
probably
from
a
mixture
of
both
apparently
fancied
that
or
rather
felt
as
if
he
was
scolding
her
and
got
cross
this
was
anything
but
dignified
especially
with
a
stranger
and
one
who
was
doing
his
best
to
help
her
and
yet
somehow
i
must
with
shame
confess
i
was
not
altogether
sorry
to
see
it
in
fact
my
reader
i
must
just
uncover
my
sin
and
say
that
i
felt
a
little
jealous
of
percivale
the
negative
reason
was
that
i
had
not
yet
learned
to
love
him
the
only
cure
for
jealousy
is
love
but
i
was
ashamed
too
of
wynnie
s
behaving
so
childishly
her
face
flushed
the
tears
came
in
her
eyes
and
she
rose
saying
with
a
little
choke
in
her
voice
i
see
it
s
no
use
trying
i
won
t
intrude
any
more
into
things
i
am
incapable
of
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
percivale
for
showing
me
how
presumptuous
i
have
the
painter
rose
as
she
rose
looking
greatly
concerned
but
he
did
not
attempt
to
answer
her
indeed
she
gave
him
no
time
he
could
only
spring
after
her
to
open
the
door
for
her
a
more
than
respectful
bow
as
she
left
the
room
was
his
only
adieu
but
when
he
turned
his
face
again
towards
me
it
expressed
even
a
degree
of
consternation
i
fear
he
said
approaching
me
with
an
almost
military
step
much
at
variance
with
the
shadow
upon
his
countenance
i
fear
i
have
been
rude
to
miss
walton
but
nothing
was
farther
you
mistake
entirely
percivale
i
heard
all
you
were
saying
and
you
were
not
in
the
least
rude
on
the
contrary
i
consider
you
were
very
kind
to
take
the
trouble
with
her
you
did
allow
me
to
make
the
apology
for
my
daughter
which
i
am
sure
she
will
wish
made
when
she
recovers
from
the
disappointment
of
finding
more
obstacles
in
the
way
of
her
favourite
pursuit
than
she
had
previously
supposed
she
is
only
too
ready
to
lose
heart
and
she
paid
too
little
attention
to
your
approbation
and
too
much
in
proportion
i
mean
to
your
criticism
she
felt
discouraged
and
lost
her
temper
but
more
with
herself
and
her
poor
attempts
i
venture
to
assure
you
than
with
your
remarks
upon
them
she
is
too
much
given
to
despising
her
own
but
i
must
have
been
to
blame
if
i
caused
any
such
feeling
with
regard
to
those
drawings
for
i
assure
you
they
contain
great
i
am
glad
you
think
so
that
i
should
myself
be
of
the
same
opinion
can
be
of
no
miss
walton
at
least
sees
what
ought
to
be
represented
all
she
needs
is
greater
severity
in
the
quality
of
representation
and
that
would
have
grown
without
any
remark
from
onlookers
only
a
friendly
criticism
is
sometimes
a
great
help
it
opens
the
eyes
a
little
sooner
than
they
would
have
opened
of
themselves
and
time
he
added
with
a
half
sigh
and
with
an
appeal
in
his
tone
as
if
he
would
justify
himself
to
my
conscience
is
half
the
battle
in
this
world
it
is
over
so
no
sooner
than
it
ought
to
be
i
rejoined
so
it
may
appear
to
you
he
returned
for
you
i
presume
to
conjecture
have
worked
hard
and
done
much
i
may
or
may
not
have
worked
hard
sometimes
i
think
i
have
sometimes
i
think
i
have
not
but
i
certainly
have
done
little
here
i
am
nearly
thirty
and
have
made
no
mark
on
the
world
i
don
t
know
that
that
is
of
so
much
consequence
i
said
i
have
never
hoped
for
more
than
to
rub
out
a
few
of
the
marks
already
perhaps
you
are
right
he
returned
every
man
has
something
he
can
do
and
more
i
suppose
that
he
can
t
do
but
i
have
no
right
to
turn
a
visit
into
a
visitation
will
you
please
tell
miss
walton
that
i
am
very
sorry
i
presumed
on
the
privileges
of
a
and
gave
her
pain
it
was
so
far
from
my
intention
that
it
will
be
a
lesson
to
me
for
the
with
these
words
he
took
his
leave
and
i
could
not
help
being
greatly
pleased
both
with
them
and
with
his
bearing
he
was
clearly
anything
but
a
common
man
chapter
vi
the
shadow
op
death
when
wynnie
appeared
at
dinner
she
looked
ashamed
of
herself
and
her
face
betrayed
that
she
had
been
crying
but
i
said
nothing
for
i
had
confidence
that
all
she
needed
was
time
to
come
to
herself
that
the
voice
that
speaks
louder
than
any
thunder
might
make
its
stillness
heard
and
when
i
came
home
from
my
walk
the
next
morning
i
found
percivale
once
more
in
the
group
about
connie
and
evidently
on
the
best
possible
terms
with
all
the
same
afternoon
wynnie
went
out
sketching
with
dora
i
had
no
doubt
that
she
had
made
some
sort
of
apology
to
percivale
but
i
did
not
make
the
slightest
attempt
to
discover
what
had
passed
between
them
for
though
it
is
of
all
things
desirable
that
children
should
be
quite
open
with
their
parents
i
was
most
anxious
to
lay
upon
them
no
burden
of
obligation
for
such
burden
lies
against
the
door
of
utterance
and
makes
it
the
more
difficult
to
open
it
paralyses
the
speech
of
the
soul
what
i
desired
was
that
they
should
trust
me
so
that
faith
should
overcome
all
difficulty
that
might
lie
in
the
way
of
their
being
open
with
me
that
end
is
not
to
be
gained
by
any
urging
of
admonition
against
such
growing
years
at
least
if
nothing
else
will
bring
a
strong
reaction
nor
even
if
so
gained
would
the
gain
be
at
all
of
the
right
sort
the
openness
would
not
be
faith
besides
a
parent
must
respect
the
spiritual
person
of
his
child
and
approach
it
with
reverence
for
that
too
looks
the
father
in
the
face
and
has
an
audience
with
him
into
which
no
earthly
parent
can
enter
even
if
he
dared
to
desire
it
therefore
i
trusted
my
child
and
when
i
saw
that
she
looked
at
me
a
little
shyly
when
we
next
met
i
only
sought
to
show
her
the
more
tenderness
and
confidence
telling
her
all
about
my
plans
with
the
bells
and
my
talks
with
the
smith
and
coombes
she
listened
with
just
such
interest
as
i
had
always
been
accustomed
to
see
in
her
asking
such
questions
and
making
such
remarks
as
i
might
have
expected
but
i
still
felt
that
there
was
the
thread
of
a
little
uneasiness
through
the
web
of
our
intercourse
such
a
thread
of
a
false
colour
as
one
may
sometimes
find
wandering
through
the
labour
of
the
loom
and
seek
with
pains
to
draw
from
the
woven
stuff
but
it
was
for
wynnie
to
take
it
out
not
for
me
and
she
did
not
leave
it
long
for
as
she
bade
me
in
my
study
she
said
suddenly
yet
with
hesitating
openness
papa
i
told
percivale
that
i
was
sorry
i
had
behaved
so
badly
about
the
you
did
right
my
child
i
replied
at
the
same
moment
a
pang
of
anxiety
passed
through
me
lest
under
the
influence
of
her
repentance
she
should
have
said
anything
more
than
becoming
but
i
banished
the
doubt
instantly
as
faithlessness
in
the
womanly
instincts
of
my
child
for
we
men
are
always
so
ready
and
anxious
to
keep
women
right
like
the
wretched
creature
laertes
in
who
reads
his
sister
such
a
lesson
on
her
maidenly
duties
but
declines
almost
with
contempt
to
listen
to
a
word
from
her
as
to
any
obligation
on
his
side
and
here
i
may
remark
in
regard
to
one
of
the
vexed
questions
of
the
day
the
rights
of
women
that
what
women
demand
it
is
not
for
men
to
withhold
it
is
not
their
business
to
lay
the
law
for
women
that
women
must
lay
down
for
themselves
i
confess
that
although
i
must
herein
seem
to
many
of
my
readers
and
conservative
i
should
not
like
to
see
any
woman
i
cared
much
for
either
in
parliament
or
in
an
anatomical
but
on
the
other
hand
i
feel
that
women
must
be
left
free
to
settle
that
matter
if
it
is
not
good
good
women
will
find
it
out
and
recoil
from
it
if
it
is
good
then
god
give
them
good
speed
one
thing
they
a
right
to
a
far
wider
and
more
valuable
education
than
they
have
been
in
the
way
of
receiving
when
the
mothers
are
well
taught
the
generations
will
grow
in
knowledge
at
a
fourfold
rate
but
still
the
teaching
of
life
is
better
than
all
the
schools
and
common
sense
than
all
learning
this
common
sense
is
a
rare
gift
scantier
in
none
than
in
those
who
lay
claim
to
it
on
the
ground
of
following
commonplace
worldly
and
prudential
maxims
but
i
must
return
to
my
wynnie
and
what
did
percivale
say
i
resumed
for
she
was
silent
he
took
the
blame
all
on
himself
like
a
gentleman
i
said
but
i
could
not
leave
it
so
you
know
papa
because
that
was
not
the
well
i
told
him
that
i
had
lost
my
temper
from
disappointment
that
i
had
thought
i
did
not
care
for
my
drawings
because
i
was
so
far
from
satisfied
with
them
but
when
he
made
me
feel
that
they
were
worth
nothing
then
i
found
from
the
vexation
i
felt
that
i
had
cared
for
them
but
i
do
think
papa
i
was
more
ashamed
of
having
shown
them
and
vexed
with
myself
than
cross
with
him
but
i
was
very
well
and
what
did
he
say
he
began
to
praise
them
then
but
you
know
i
could
not
take
much
of
that
for
what
could
he
do
you
might
give
him
credit
for
a
little
honesty
at
yes
but
things
may
be
true
in
a
way
you
know
and
not
mean
he
seems
to
have
succeeded
in
reconciling
you
to
the
prosecution
of
your
efforts
however
for
i
saw
you
go
out
with
your
sketching
apparatus
this
yes
she
answered
shyly
he
was
so
kind
that
somehow
i
got
heart
to
try
again
he
s
very
nice
isn
t
he
my
answer
was
not
quite
ready
don
t
you
like
him
papa
well
i
like
him
yes
but
we
must
not
be
in
haste
with
our
judgments
you
know
i
have
had
very
little
opportunity
of
seeing
into
him
there
is
much
in
him
that
i
like
but
but
what
please
to
tell
the
truth
then
wynnie
for
i
can
speak
my
mind
to
you
my
child
there
is
a
certain
shyness
of
approaching
the
subject
of
religion
so
that
i
have
my
fears
lest
he
should
belong
to
any
of
these
new
schools
of
a
fragmentary
philosophy
which
acknowledge
no
source
of
truth
but
the
testimony
of
the
senses
and
the
deductions
made
therefrom
by
the
but
is
not
that
a
hasty
conclusion
papa
that
is
a
hasty
question
my
dear
i
have
come
to
no
conclusion
i
was
only
speaking
confidentially
about
my
perhaps
papa
it
s
only
that
he
s
not
sure
enough
and
is
afraid
of
appearing
to
profess
more
than
he
believes
i
m
sure
if
that
s
it
i
have
the
greatest
sympathy
with
i
looked
at
her
and
saw
the
tears
gathering
fast
in
her
eyes
pray
to
god
on
the
chance
of
his
hearing
you
my
darling
and
go
to
sleep
i
said
i
will
not
think
hardly
of
you
because
you
can
not
be
so
sure
as
i
am
how
could
you
be
you
have
not
had
my
experience
perhaps
you
are
right
about
percivale
too
but
it
would
be
an
awkward
thing
to
get
intimate
with
him
you
know
and
then
find
out
that
we
did
not
like
him
after
all
you
couldn
t
like
a
man
much
could
you
who
did
not
believe
in
anything
greater
than
himself
anything
marvellous
grand
beyond
our
understanding
who
thought
that
he
had
come
out
of
the
dirt
and
was
going
back
to
the
dirt
i
could
papa
if
he
tried
to
do
his
duty
notwithstanding
for
i
m
sure
i
couldn
t
i
should
cry
myself
to
you
are
right
my
child
i
should
honour
him
too
but
i
should
be
very
sorry
for
him
for
he
would
be
so
disappointed
in
i
do
not
know
whether
this
was
the
best
answer
to
make
but
i
had
little
time
to
think
but
you
don
t
know
that
he
s
like
i
do
not
my
dear
and
more
i
will
not
associate
the
idea
with
him
till
i
know
for
certain
we
will
leave
it
to
ignorant
old
ladies
who
lay
claim
to
an
instinct
for
theology
to
jump
at
conclusions
and
reserve
ours
as
even
such
a
man
as
we
have
been
supposing
might
well
teach
us
till
we
have
sufficient
facts
from
which
to
draw
them
now
go
to
bed
my
then
dear
papa
she
said
and
left
me
with
a
kiss
i
was
not
altogether
comfortable
after
this
conversation
i
had
tried
to
be
fair
to
the
young
man
both
in
word
and
thought
but
i
could
not
relish
the
idea
of
my
daughter
falling
in
love
with
him
which
looked
likely
enough
before
i
knew
more
about
him
and
found
that
good
and
there
was
but
one
rational
thing
left
to
do
and
that
was
to
cast
my
care
on
him
that
careth
for
us
on
the
father
who
loved
my
child
more
than
even
i
could
love
her
and
loved
the
young
man
too
and
regarded
my
anxiety
and
would
take
its
cause
upon
himself
after
i
had
lifted
up
my
heart
to
him
i
was
at
ease
read
a
canto
of
dante
s
and
then
went
to
bed
the
prematurity
of
a
conversation
with
my
wife
in
which
i
found
that
she
was
very
favourably
impressed
with
percivale
must
be
pardoned
to
the
forecasting
hearts
of
fathers
and
mothers
as
i
went
out
for
my
walk
the
next
morning
i
caught
sight
of
the
sexton
with
whom
as
yet
i
had
had
but
little
communication
busily
trimming
some
of
the
newer
graves
in
the
churchyard
i
turned
in
through
the
nearer
gate
which
was
fashioned
like
a
with
seats
on
the
sides
and
a
stone
table
in
the
centre
but
had
no
roof
the
one
on
the
other
side
of
the
church
was
roofed
but
probably
they
had
found
that
here
no
roof
could
resist
the
in
winter
the
top
of
the
wall
where
the
roof
should
have
rested
was
simply
covered
with
flat
slates
to
protect
it
from
the
rain
coombes
i
said
he
turned
up
a
wizened
humorous
old
face
the
very
type
of
a
gravedigger
s
and
with
one
hand
leaning
on
the
edge
of
the
green
mound
upon
which
he
had
been
cropping
with
a
pair
of
shears
the
too
long
and
too
thin
grass
touched
his
cap
with
the
other
and
bade
me
a
cheerful
in
return
you
re
making
things
tidy
i
said
it
take
time
to
make
them
all
comfortable
you
see
sir
he
returned
taking
up
his
shears
again
and
clipping
away
at
the
top
and
sides
of
the
mound
you
mean
the
dead
coombes
yes
sir
to
be
sure
you
don
t
think
it
makes
much
difference
to
their
comfort
do
you
whether
the
grass
is
one
length
or
another
upon
their
graves
well
no
sir
i
don
t
suppose
it
makes
difference
to
them
but
it
look
more
comfortable
you
know
and
i
like
things
to
look
comfortable
don
t
you
sir
to
be
sure
i
do
coombes
and
you
are
quite
right
the
of
the
body
although
the
person
it
belonged
to
be
far
away
should
be
that
s
what
i
think
though
i
don
t
get
no
credit
for
it
i
du
believe
the
people
hereabouts
thinks
me
only
a
single
hair
better
than
a
jack
ketch
but
i
m
sure
i
du
my
best
to
make
the
poor
things
he
seemed
unable
to
rid
his
mind
of
the
idea
that
the
comfort
of
the
departed
was
dependent
upon
his
ministrations
the
trouble
i
have
with
them
sometimes
there
s
now
this
same
one
as
lies
here
old
jonathan
giles
he
have
the
gout
so
bad
and
just
as
i
come
within
a
couple
o
inches
o
the
right
depth
out
come
the
edge
of
a
great
stone
in
the
near
corner
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
thinks
i
he
ll
never
lie
comfortable
with
that
same
under
his
gouty
toe
but
the
trouble
i
had
to
get
out
that
stone
i
du
assure
you
sir
it
took
me
nigh
half
the
but
this
be
one
of
the
nicest
places
to
lie
in
all
up
and
down
the
coast
a
nice
gravelly
soil
you
see
sir
dry
and
warm
and
comfortable
them
poor
things
as
comes
out
of
the
sea
must
quite
enjoy
the
change
there
was
something
grotesque
in
the
man
s
persistence
in
regarding
the
objects
of
his
interest
from
this
point
of
view
it
was
a
curious
way
for
the
humanity
that
was
in
him
to
find
expression
but
i
did
not
like
to
let
him
go
on
thus
it
was
so
much
opposed
to
all
that
i
believed
and
felt
about
the
change
from
this
world
to
the
next
but
coombes
i
said
why
will
you
go
on
talking
as
if
it
made
an
atom
of
difference
to
the
dead
bodies
where
they
were
buried
they
care
no
more
about
it
than
your
old
coat
would
care
where
it
was
thrown
after
you
had
done
with
he
turned
and
regarded
his
coat
where
it
hung
beside
him
on
the
headstone
of
the
same
grave
at
which
he
was
working
shook
his
head
with
a
smile
that
seemed
to
hint
a
doubt
whether
the
said
old
coat
would
be
altogether
so
indifferent
to
its
treatment
when
it
was
past
use
as
i
had
implied
then
he
turned
again
to
his
work
and
after
a
moment
s
silence
began
to
approach
me
from
another
side
i
confess
he
had
the
better
of
me
before
i
was
aware
of
what
he
was
about
the
church
of
boscastle
stands
high
on
the
cliff
you
ve
been
to
boscastle
sir
i
told
him
i
had
not
yet
but
hoped
to
go
before
the
summer
was
over
ah
you
should
see
boscastle
sir
it
s
a
wonderful
place
that
s
where
i
was
born
sir
when
i
was
a
by
that
church
was
haunted
sir
it
s
a
damp
place
and
the
wind
in
it
awful
i
du
believe
it
stand
higher
than
any
church
in
the
country
and
have
got
more
wind
in
it
of
a
stormy
night
than
any
church
whatsomever
well
they
said
it
was
haunted
and
sure
enough
every
now
and
then
there
was
a
knocking
heard
down
below
and
this
always
took
place
of
a
stormy
night
as
if
there
was
some
poor
thing
down
in
the
low
wouts
and
he
wasn
t
comfortable
and
wanted
to
get
out
well
one
night
it
was
so
plain
and
so
fearful
it
was
that
the
sexton
he
went
and
took
the
blacksmith
and
a
ship
s
carpenter
down
to
the
harbour
and
they
go
up
together
and
they
hearken
all
over
the
floor
and
they
open
one
of
the
old
family
wouts
that
belongs
to
the
penhaligans
and
they
go
down
with
a
light
now
the
wind
it
was
all
as
usual
only
worse
than
common
and
there
to
be
sure
what
do
they
see
but
the
wout
of
and
nows
and
thens
a
great
spout
coming
in
through
a
hole
in
the
rock
for
it
was
and
a
wind
off
the
sea
as
i
tell
you
and
there
was
a
coffin
afloat
on
the
water
and
every
time
the
spout
come
through
it
set
it
knocking
agen
the
side
o
the
wout
and
that
was
the
what
a
horrible
idea
i
said
with
a
at
the
unrest
of
the
dead
the
old
man
uttered
a
queer
sound
neither
a
chuckle
a
crow
nor
a
laugh
but
a
mixture
of
all
three
and
turned
himself
yet
again
to
the
work
which
as
he
approached
the
end
of
his
narration
he
had
suspended
that
he
might
make
his
story
i
suppose
by
looking
me
in
the
face
and
as
he
turned
he
said
i
thought
you
would
like
to
be
comfortable
then
as
well
as
other
people
i
could
not
help
laughing
to
see
how
the
cunning
old
fellow
had
caught
me
i
have
not
yet
been
able
to
find
out
how
much
of
truth
there
was
in
his
story
from
the
twinkle
of
his
eye
i
can
not
help
suspecting
that
if
he
did
not
invent
the
tale
he
embellished
it
at
least
in
order
to
produce
the
effect
which
he
certainly
did
produce
humour
was
clearly
his
predominant
disposition
the
reflex
of
which
was
to
be
seen
after
a
mild
lunar
fashion
on
the
countenance
of
his
wife
neither
could
i
help
thinking
with
pleasure
as
i
turned
away
how
the
merry
little
old
man
would
enjoy
telling
his
companions
how
he
had
posed
the
new
parson
very
welcome
was
he
to
his
laugh
for
my
part
yet
i
gladly
left
the
churchyard
with
its
sunshine
above
and
its
darkness
below
indeed
i
had
to
look
up
to
the
glittering
vanes
on
the
four
pinnacles
of
the
dwelling
aloft
in
the
clean
sunny
air
to
get
the
feeling
of
the
dark
vault
and
the
floating
coffin
and
the
knocking
heard
in
the
windy
church
out
of
my
brain
but
the
thing
that
did
free
me
was
the
reflection
with
what
supreme
disregard
the
disincarcerated
spirit
would
look
upon
any
possible
vicissitudes
of
its
abandoned
vault
for
in
proportion
as
the
body
of
man
s
revelation
ceases
to
be
in
harmony
with
the
spirit
that
dwells
therein
it
becomes
a
vault
a
prison
from
which
it
must
be
freedom
to
escape
at
length
the
house
we
like
best
would
be
a
prison
of
awful
sort
if
doors
and
windows
were
built
up
man
s
abode
as
age
begins
to
draw
nigh
fares
thus
age
is
in
fact
the
mason
that
builds
up
the
doors
and
the
windows
and
death
is
the
angel
that
breaks
the
and
lets
the
captives
free
thus
i
got
something
out
of
the
sexton
s
horrible
story
but
before
the
week
was
over
death
came
near
indeed
in
far
other
fashion
than
any
funereal
tale
could
have
brought
it
one
day
after
lunch
i
had
retired
to
my
study
and
was
dozing
in
my
chair
for
the
day
was
hot
when
i
was
waked
by
charlie
rushing
into
the
room
with
the
cry
papa
papa
there
s
a
man
i
started
up
and
hurried
down
to
the
which
looked
out
over
the
bay
i
could
see
nothing
but
people
running
about
on
the
edge
of
the
quiet
waves
no
sign
of
human
being
was
on
the
water
but
the
one
boat
belonging
to
the
pilot
was
coming
out
from
the
shelter
of
the
lock
of
the
canal
where
it
usually
lay
and
my
friend
of
the
coastguard
was
running
down
from
the
tower
on
the
cliff
with
ropes
in
his
hand
he
would
not
stop
the
boat
even
for
the
moment
it
would
need
to
take
him
on
board
but
threw
them
in
and
urged
to
haste
i
stood
at
the
window
and
watched
every
now
and
then
i
fancied
i
saw
something
white
heaved
up
on
the
swell
of
a
wave
and
as
often
was
satisfied
that
i
had
but
fancied
it
the
boat
seemed
to
be
floating
about
lazily
if
not
idly
the
eagerness
to
help
made
it
appear
as
if
nothing
was
going
on
could
it
after
all
have
been
a
false
alarm
was
there
after
all
no
insensible
form
swinging
about
in
the
sweep
of
those
waves
with
life
gradually
oozing
away
long
long
as
it
seemed
to
me
i
watched
and
still
the
boat
kept
moving
from
place
to
place
so
far
out
that
i
could
see
nothing
distinctly
of
the
motions
of
its
crew
at
length
i
saw
something
yes
a
long
white
thing
rose
from
the
water
slowly
and
was
drawn
into
the
boat
it
rowed
swiftly
to
the
shore
there
was
but
one
place
fit
to
land
upon
a
little
patch
of
sand
nearly
covered
at
but
now
lying
yellow
in
the
sun
under
the
window
at
which
i
stood
and
immediately
under
our
thither
the
boat
shot
along
and
there
my
friend
of
the
coastguard
earnest
and
sad
was
waiting
to
use
though
without
hope
every
appliance
so
well
known
to
him
from
the
frequent
occurrence
of
such
necessity
in
the
course
of
his
watchful
duties
along
miles
and
miles
of
stormy
coast
i
will
not
linger
over
the
sad
details
of
vain
endeavour
the
honoured
head
of
a
family
he
had
departed
and
left
a
good
name
behind
him
but
even
in
the
midst
of
my
poor
attentions
to
the
quiet
speechless
wife
who
sat
at
the
head
of
the
corpse
i
could
not
help
feeling
anxious
about
the
effect
on
my
connie
it
was
impossible
to
keep
the
matter
concealed
from
her
the
undoubted
concern
on
the
faces
of
the
two
boys
was
enough
to
reveal
that
something
serious
and
painful
had
occurred
while
my
wife
and
wynnie
and
indeed
the
whole
household
were
busy
in
attending
to
every
remotest
suggestion
of
aid
that
reached
them
from
the
little
crowd
gathered
about
the
body
at
length
it
was
concluded
on
the
verdict
of
the
medical
man
who
had
been
sent
for
that
all
further
effort
was
useless
the
body
was
borne
away
and
i
led
the
poor
lady
to
her
lodging
and
remained
there
with
her
till
i
found
that
as
she
lay
on
the
sofa
the
sleep
that
so
often
dogs
the
steps
of
sorrow
had
at
length
thrown
its
veil
over
her
consciousness
and
put
her
for
the
time
to
rest
there
is
a
gentle
consolation
in
the
firmness
of
the
grasp
of
the
inevitable
known
but
to
those
who
are
led
through
the
valley
of
the
shadow
i
left
her
with
her
son
and
daughter
and
returned
to
my
own
family
they
too
were
of
course
in
the
skirts
of
the
cloud
had
they
only
heard
of
the
occurrence
it
would
have
had
little
effect
but
death
had
appeared
to
them
everyone
but
connie
had
seen
the
dead
lying
there
and
before
the
day
was
over
i
wished
that
she
too
had
seen
the
dead
for
i
found
from
what
she
said
at
intervals
and
from
the
shudder
that
now
and
then
passed
through
her
that
her
imagination
was
at
work
showing
but
the
horrors
that
belong
to
death
for
the
enfolding
peace
that
accompanies
it
can
be
known
but
by
sight
of
the
dead
when
i
spoke
to
her
she
seemed
and
i
suppose
for
the
time
felt
tolerably
quiet
and
comfortable
but
i
could
see
that
the
words
she
had
heard
fall
in
the
going
and
coming
and
the
communications
of
charlie
and
harry
to
each
other
had
made
as
it
were
an
excoriation
on
her
fancy
to
which
her
consciousness
was
ever
returning
and
now
i
became
more
grateful
than
i
had
yet
been
for
the
gift
of
that
for
i
felt
no
anxiety
about
connie
so
long
as
she
was
with
her
the
presence
even
of
her
mother
could
not
relieve
her
for
she
and
wynnie
were
both
clouded
with
the
same
awe
and
its
reflex
in
connie
was
distorted
by
her
fancy
but
the
sweet
ignorance
of
the
baby
which
rightly
considered
is
more
than
a
type
or
symbol
of
faith
operated
most
healingly
for
she
appeared
in
her
sweet
merry
ways
no
baby
was
ever
more
filled
with
the
mere
gladness
of
life
than
connie
s
baby
to
the
mood
in
which
they
all
were
like
a
little
sunny
window
in
a
cathedral
crypt
telling
of
a
whole
universe
of
sunshine
and
motion
beyond
those
oppressed
pillars
and
arches
and
why
should
not
the
baby
know
best
i
believe
the
babies
do
know
best
i
therefore
favoured
her
having
the
child
more
than
i
might
otherwise
have
thought
good
for
her
being
anxious
to
get
the
dreary
unhealthy
impression
healed
as
soon
as
possible
lest
it
should
in
the
delicate
physical
condition
in
which
she
was
turn
to
a
sore
but
my
wife
suffered
for
a
time
nearly
as
much
as
connie
as
long
as
she
was
going
about
the
house
or
attending
to
the
wants
of
her
family
she
was
free
but
no
sooner
did
she
lay
her
head
on
the
pillow
than
in
rushed
the
cry
of
the
sea
fierce
unkind
craving
like
a
wild
beast
again
and
again
she
spoke
of
it
to
me
for
it
came
to
her
mingled
with
the
voice
of
the
tempter
saying
over
and
over
again
for
although
the
two
words
contradict
each
other
when
put
together
thus
each
in
its
turn
would
assert
itself
a
great
part
of
the
doubt
in
the
world
comes
from
the
fact
that
there
are
in
it
so
many
more
of
the
impressible
as
compared
with
the
originating
minds
where
the
openness
to
impression
is
balanced
by
the
power
of
production
the
painful
questions
of
the
world
are
speedily
met
by
their
answers
where
such
is
not
the
case
there
are
often
long
periods
of
suffering
till
the
of
truth
is
brought
to
the
birth
hence
the
need
for
every
impressible
mind
to
be
by
reading
or
speech
held
in
living
association
with
an
original
mind
able
to
combat
those
suggestions
of
doubt
and
even
unbelief
which
the
look
of
things
must
often
occasion
a
look
which
comes
from
our
inability
to
gain
other
than
fragmentary
visions
of
the
work
that
the
father
worketh
hitherto
when
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
at
hand
one
sign
thereof
will
be
that
all
clergymen
will
be
more
or
less
of
the
latter
sort
and
mere
receptive
goodness
no
more
than
education
and
moral
character
will
be
considered
sufficient
reason
for
a
man
s
occupying
the
high
position
of
an
instructor
of
his
fellows
but
even
now
this
possession
of
original
power
is
not
by
any
means
to
be
limited
to
those
who
make
public
show
of
the
same
in
many
a
humble
parish
priest
it
shows
itself
at
the
bedside
of
the
suffering
or
in
the
admonition
of
the
closet
although
as
yet
there
are
many
of
the
clergy
who
so
far
from
being
able
to
console
wisely
are
incapable
of
understanding
the
condition
of
those
that
need
consolation
it
is
all
a
fancy
my
dear
i
said
to
her
there
is
nothing
more
terrible
in
this
than
in
any
other
death
on
the
contrary
i
can
hardly
imagine
a
less
fearful
one
a
big
wave
falls
on
the
man
s
head
and
stuns
him
and
without
further
suffering
he
floats
gently
out
on
the
sea
of
the
but
it
is
so
terrible
for
those
left
behind
had
you
seen
the
face
of
his
widow
so
gentle
so
loving
so
resigned
in
its
pallor
you
would
not
have
thought
it
so
but
though
she
always
seemed
satisfied
and
no
doubt
felt
nearly
so
after
any
conversation
of
the
sort
yet
every
night
she
would
call
out
once
and
again
o
that
sea
out
there
i
was
very
glad
indeed
when
turner
who
had
arranged
to
spend
a
short
holiday
with
us
arrived
he
was
concerned
at
the
news
i
gave
him
of
the
shock
both
connie
and
her
mother
had
received
and
counselled
an
immediate
change
that
time
might
in
the
absence
of
surrounding
associations
obliterate
something
of
the
impression
that
had
been
made
the
consequence
was
that
we
resolved
to
remove
our
household
for
a
short
time
to
some
place
not
too
far
off
to
permit
of
my
attending
to
my
duties
at
kilkhaven
but
out
of
the
sight
and
sound
of
the
sea
it
was
thursday
when
turner
arrived
and
he
spent
the
next
two
days
in
inquiring
and
looking
about
for
a
suitable
spot
to
which
we
might
repair
as
early
in
the
week
as
possible
on
the
saturday
the
blacksmith
was
busy
in
the
and
i
went
in
to
see
how
he
was
getting
on
you
had
a
sad
business
here
the
last
week
sir
he
said
after
we
had
done
talking
about
the
repairs
a
very
sad
business
indeed
i
answered
it
was
a
warning
to
us
all
he
said
we
may
well
take
it
so
i
returned
but
it
seems
to
me
that
we
are
too
ready
to
think
of
such
remarkable
things
only
by
themselves
instead
of
being
roused
by
them
to
regard
everything
common
and
uncommon
as
ordered
by
the
same
care
and
one
of
our
local
preachers
made
a
grand
use
of
i
made
no
reply
he
resumed
they
tell
me
you
took
no
notice
of
it
last
sunday
i
made
no
immediate
allusion
to
it
certainly
but
i
preached
under
the
influence
of
it
and
i
thought
it
better
that
those
who
could
reflect
on
the
matter
should
be
thus
led
to
think
for
themselves
than
that
they
should
be
subjected
to
the
reception
of
my
thoughts
and
feelings
about
it
for
in
the
main
it
is
life
and
not
death
that
we
have
to
i
don
t
quite
understand
you
sir
but
then
you
don
t
care
much
for
preaching
in
your
i
confess
i
answered
that
there
has
been
much
indifference
on
that
point
i
could
however
mention
to
you
many
and
grand
exceptions
still
there
is
even
in
some
of
the
best
in
the
church
a
great
amount
of
disbelief
in
the
efficacy
of
preaching
and
i
allow
that
a
great
deal
of
what
is
called
preaching
partakes
of
its
nature
only
in
the
remotest
degree
but
while
i
hold
a
strong
opinion
of
its
value
that
is
where
it
is
genuine
i
venture
just
to
suggest
that
the
nature
of
the
preaching
to
which
the
body
you
belong
to
has
resorted
has
had
something
to
do
by
way
of
a
reaction
in
driving
the
church
to
the
other
how
do
you
mean
that
sir
you
try
to
work
upon
people
s
feelings
without
reference
to
their
judgment
anyone
who
can
preach
what
you
call
rousing
sermons
is
considered
a
grand
preacher
amongst
you
and
there
is
a
great
danger
of
his
being
led
thereby
to
talk
more
nonsense
than
sense
and
then
when
the
excitement
goes
off
there
is
no
seed
left
in
the
soil
to
grow
in
peace
and
they
are
always
craving
after
more
well
there
is
the
preacher
to
rouse
them
up
and
the
consequence
is
that
they
continue
like
children
the
good
ones
i
mean
and
have
hardly
a
chance
of
making
a
calm
deliberate
choice
of
that
which
is
good
while
those
who
have
been
only
excited
and
nothing
more
are
hardened
and
seared
by
the
recurrence
of
such
feeling
as
is
neither
aroused
by
truth
nor
followed
by
you
daren
t
talk
like
that
if
you
knew
the
kind
of
people
in
this
country
that
the
methodists
as
you
call
them
have
got
a
hold
of
they
tell
me
it
was
like
hell
itself
down
in
those
mines
before
wesley
come
among
i
should
be
a
fool
or
a
bigot
to
doubt
that
the
wesleyans
have
done
incalculable
good
in
the
country
and
that
not
alone
to
the
people
who
never
went
to
church
the
whole
church
of
england
is
under
obligations
to
methodism
such
as
no
words
can
i
wonder
you
can
say
such
things
against
them
now
there
you
show
the
evil
of
thinking
too
much
about
the
party
you
belong
to
it
makes
a
man
touchy
and
then
he
fancies
when
another
is
merely
it
may
be
analysing
a
difference
or
insisting
strongly
on
some
great
truth
that
he
is
talking
against
his
but
you
said
sir
that
our
clergy
don
t
care
about
moving
our
judgments
only
our
feelings
now
i
know
preachers
amongst
us
of
whom
that
would
be
anything
but
of
course
there
must
be
but
there
is
what
i
say
your
makes
you
touchy
a
man
can
t
always
be
saying
in
the
press
of
utterance
course
there
are
that
is
understood
i
confess
i
do
not
know
much
about
your
clergy
for
i
have
not
had
the
opportunity
but
i
do
know
this
that
some
of
the
best
and
most
liberal
people
i
have
ever
known
have
belonged
to
your
they
do
gather
a
deal
of
money
for
good
yes
but
that
was
not
what
i
meant
by
it
is
far
easier
to
give
money
than
to
be
generous
in
judgment
i
meant
by
able
to
see
the
good
and
true
in
people
that
differ
from
you
glad
to
be
roused
to
the
reception
of
truth
in
god
s
name
from
whatever
quarter
it
may
come
and
not
readily
finding
offence
where
a
remark
may
have
chanced
to
be
too
sweeping
or
unguarded
but
i
see
that
i
ought
to
be
more
careful
for
i
have
made
you
who
certainly
are
not
one
of
the
quarrelsome
people
i
have
been
speaking
of
misunderstand
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
i
was
hasty
but
i
do
think
i
am
more
ready
to
lose
my
temper
since
here
he
stopped
a
fit
of
coughing
came
on
and
to
my
concern
was
followed
by
what
i
saw
plainly
could
be
the
result
only
of
a
rupture
in
the
lungs
i
insisted
on
his
dropping
his
work
and
coming
home
with
me
where
i
made
him
rest
the
remainder
of
the
day
and
all
sunday
sending
word
to
his
mother
that
i
could
not
let
him
go
home
when
we
left
on
the
monday
morning
we
took
him
with
us
in
the
carriage
hired
for
the
journey
and
set
him
down
at
his
mother
s
apparently
no
worse
than
usual
chapter
vii
at
the
farm
leaving
the
younger
members
of
the
family
at
home
with
the
servants
we
set
out
for
a
farmhouse
some
twenty
miles
off
which
turner
had
discovered
for
us
connie
had
stood
the
journey
down
so
well
and
was
now
so
much
stronger
that
we
had
no
anxiety
about
her
so
far
as
regarded
the
travelling
through
deep
lanes
with
many
cottages
and
here
and
there
a
very
ugly
little
chapel
over
steep
hills
up
which
turner
and
wynnie
and
i
walked
and
along
sterile
moors
we
drove
stopping
at
roadside
inns
and
often
besides
to
raise
connie
and
let
her
look
about
upon
the
extended
prospect
so
that
it
was
drawing
towards
evening
before
we
arrived
at
our
destination
on
the
way
turner
had
warned
us
that
we
were
not
to
expect
a
beautiful
country
although
the
place
was
within
reach
of
much
that
was
remarkable
therefore
we
were
not
surprised
when
we
drew
up
at
the
door
of
a
shelterless
house
with
scarcely
a
tree
in
sight
and
a
stretch
of
undulating
fields
on
every
side
a
dreary
place
in
winter
turner
i
said
after
we
had
seen
connie
comfortably
deposited
in
the
nice
parlour
smelling
of
dried
roses
even
in
the
height
of
the
fresh
ones
and
had
strolled
out
while
our
tea
dinner
was
being
got
ready
for
us
not
a
doubt
of
it
but
just
the
place
i
wanted
for
miss
connie
he
replied
we
are
high
above
the
sea
and
the
air
is
very
bracing
and
not
at
this
season
too
cold
a
month
later
i
should
not
on
any
account
have
brought
her
i
think
even
now
there
is
a
certain
freshness
in
the
wind
that
calls
up
a
kind
of
will
in
the
nerves
to
meet
that
is
precisely
what
i
wanted
for
you
all
you
observe
there
is
no
rasp
in
its
touch
however
there
are
regions
in
this
island
of
ours
where
even
in
the
hottest
day
in
summer
you
would
frequently
discover
a
certain
unfriendly
edge
in
the
air
that
would
set
you
wondering
whether
the
seasons
had
not
changed
since
you
were
a
boy
and
used
to
lie
on
the
grass
half
the
idle
i
often
do
wonder
whether
it
may
not
be
so
but
i
always
come
to
the
conclusion
that
even
this
is
but
an
example
of
the
involuntary
tendency
of
the
mind
of
man
towards
the
ideal
he
forgets
all
that
comes
between
and
divides
the
hints
of
perfection
scattered
here
and
there
along
the
scope
of
his
experience
i
especially
remember
one
summer
day
in
my
childhood
which
has
coloured
all
my
ideas
of
summer
and
bliss
and
fulfilment
of
content
it
is
made
up
of
only
mossy
grass
and
the
scent
of
the
earth
and
wild
flowers
and
hot
sun
and
perfect
sky
deep
and
blue
and
traversed
by
blinding
white
clouds
i
could
not
have
been
more
than
five
or
six
i
think
from
the
kind
of
dress
i
wore
the
very
pearl
buttons
of
which
encircled
on
their
face
with
a
ring
of
hollows
have
their
undeniable
relation
in
my
memory
to
the
heavens
and
the
earth
to
the
march
of
the
glorious
clouds
and
the
tender
scent
of
the
rooted
flowers
and
indeed
when
i
think
of
it
must
by
the
delight
they
gave
me
have
opened
my
mind
the
more
to
the
enjoyment
of
the
eternal
paradise
around
me
what
a
thing
it
is
to
please
a
child
i
know
what
you
mean
perfectly
answered
turner
it
is
as
i
get
older
that
i
understand
what
wordsworth
says
about
childhood
it
is
indeed
a
mercy
that
we
were
not
born
grown
men
with
what
we
consider
our
wits
about
us
they
are
blinding
things
those
wits
we
gather
i
fancy
that
the
single
thread
by
which
god
sometimes
keeps
hold
of
a
man
is
such
an
impression
of
his
childhood
as
that
of
which
you
have
been
i
do
not
doubt
it
for
conscience
is
so
near
in
all
those
memories
to
which
you
refer
the
whole
surrounding
of
them
is
so
at
variance
with
sin
a
sense
of
purity
not
in
himself
for
the
child
is
not
feeling
that
he
is
pure
is
all
about
him
and
when
afterwards
the
condition
returns
upon
him
returns
when
he
is
conscious
of
so
much
that
is
evil
and
so
much
that
is
unsatisfied
in
him
it
brings
with
it
a
longing
after
the
high
clear
air
of
moral
do
you
think
then
that
it
is
only
by
association
that
nature
thus
impresses
us
that
she
has
no
power
of
meaning
these
things
not
at
all
no
doubt
there
is
something
in
the
recollection
of
the
associations
of
childhood
to
strengthen
the
power
of
nature
upon
us
but
the
power
is
in
nature
herself
else
it
would
be
but
a
poor
weak
thing
to
what
it
is
there
purity
and
state
in
that
sky
there
a
peace
now
in
this
wide
still
earth
not
so
very
beautiful
you
own
and
in
that
overhanging
blue
which
my
heart
cries
out
that
it
needs
and
can
not
be
well
till
it
gains
gains
in
the
truth
gains
in
god
who
is
the
power
of
truth
the
living
and
causing
truth
there
is
indeed
a
rest
that
remaineth
a
rest
pictured
out
even
here
this
night
to
rouse
my
dull
heart
to
desire
it
and
follow
after
it
a
rest
that
consists
in
thinking
the
thoughts
of
him
who
is
the
peace
because
the
unity
in
being
filled
with
that
spirit
which
now
pictures
itself
forth
in
this
repose
of
the
heavens
and
the
true
said
turner
after
a
pause
i
must
think
more
about
such
things
the
science
the
present
day
is
going
wild
about
will
not
give
us
that
no
but
that
rest
will
do
much
to
give
you
that
science
a
man
with
this
repose
in
his
heart
will
do
more
by
far
other
capabilities
being
equal
to
find
out
the
laws
that
govern
things
for
all
law
is
living
what
you
have
been
saying
resumed
turner
after
another
pause
reminds
me
much
of
one
of
wordsworth
s
poems
i
do
not
mean
the
famous
you
mean
the
ninth
evening
voluntary
i
know
one
of
his
finest
and
truest
and
deepest
poems
it
begins
had
this
effulgence
yes
that
is
the
one
i
mean
i
shall
read
it
again
when
i
go
home
but
you
don
t
agree
with
wordsworth
do
you
about
our
having
had
an
existence
previous
to
this
he
gave
a
little
laugh
as
he
asked
the
question
not
in
the
least
but
an
opinion
held
by
such
men
as
plato
origen
and
wordsworth
is
not
to
be
laughed
at
turner
it
can
not
be
in
its
nature
absurd
i
might
have
mentioned
shelley
as
holding
it
too
had
his
opinion
been
worth
then
you
don
t
think
much
of
shelley
i
think
his
most
valuable
his
nearly
well
perhaps
i
had
no
business
to
laugh
at
it
but
do
not
suppose
for
a
moment
that
i
even
lean
to
it
i
dislike
it
it
would
make
me
unhappy
to
think
there
was
the
least
of
sound
argument
for
it
but
i
respect
the
men
who
have
held
it
and
know
there
must
be
good
in
it
else
they
could
not
have
held
are
you
able
then
to
sympathise
with
that
ode
of
wordsworth
s
does
it
not
depend
for
all
its
worth
on
the
admission
of
this
theory
not
in
the
least
is
it
necessary
to
admit
that
we
must
have
had
a
conscious
life
before
this
life
to
find
meaning
in
the
words
but
trailing
clouds
of
glory
do
we
come
from
god
who
is
our
home
is
not
all
the
good
in
us
his
image
imperfect
and
sinful
as
we
are
is
not
all
the
foundation
of
our
being
his
image
is
not
the
sin
all
ours
and
the
life
in
us
all
god
s
we
can
not
be
the
creatures
of
god
without
partaking
of
his
nature
every
motion
of
our
conscience
every
admiration
of
what
is
pure
and
noble
is
a
sign
and
a
result
of
this
is
not
every
a
proof
of
the
presence
of
his
spirit
that
comes
not
of
ourselves
that
is
not
without
him
these
are
the
clouds
of
glory
we
come
trailing
from
him
all
feelings
of
beauty
and
peace
and
loveliness
and
right
and
goodness
we
trail
with
us
from
our
home
god
is
the
only
home
of
the
human
soul
to
interpret
in
this
manner
what
wordsworth
says
will
enable
us
to
enter
into
perfect
sympathy
with
all
that
grandest
of
his
poems
i
do
not
say
this
is
what
he
meant
but
i
think
it
includes
what
he
meant
by
being
greater
and
wider
than
what
he
meant
nor
am
i
guilty
of
presumption
in
saying
so
for
surely
the
idea
that
we
are
born
of
god
is
a
greater
idea
than
that
we
have
lived
with
him
a
life
before
this
life
but
wordsworth
is
not
the
first
among
our
religious
poets
to
give
us
at
least
what
is
valuable
in
the
notion
i
came
upon
a
volume
amongst
my
friend
shepherd
s
books
with
which
i
had
made
no
acquaintance
before
henry
vaughan
s
poems
i
brought
it
with
me
for
it
has
finer
lines
i
almost
think
than
any
in
george
herbert
though
not
so
fine
poems
by
any
means
as
his
best
when
we
go
into
the
house
i
will
read
one
of
them
to
thank
you
said
turner
i
wish
i
could
have
such
talk
once
a
week
the
shades
of
the
you
know
walton
are
always
trying
to
close
about
us
and
shut
out
the
vision
of
the
glories
we
have
come
from
as
wordsworth
a
man
i
answered
who
ministers
to
the
miserable
necessities
of
his
fellows
has
even
more
need
than
another
to
believe
in
the
light
and
the
gladness
else
a
poor
job
s
comforter
will
he
be
don
t
want
to
be
treated
like
a
musical
the
doctor
laughed
no
man
can
he
said
that
there
is
not
a
being
inside
the
existing
in
virtue
of
the
harmony
of
its
parts
comfortable
when
they
go
well
sick
when
they
go
badly
and
dying
when
it
is
dismembered
or
even
when
it
no
i
answered
no
man
can
prove
it
but
no
man
can
convince
a
human
being
of
it
and
just
as
little
can
anyone
convince
me
that
my
conscience
making
me
do
sometimes
what
i
like
comes
from
a
harmonious
action
of
the
particles
of
my
brain
but
it
is
time
we
went
in
for
by
the
law
of
things
in
general
i
being
ready
for
my
dinner
my
dinner
ought
to
be
ready
for
a
law
with
more
exceptions
than
instances
i
fear
said
turner
i
doubt
that
i
answered
the
readiness
is
everything
and
that
we
constantly
blunder
in
but
we
had
better
see
whether
we
are
really
ready
for
it
by
trying
whether
it
is
ready
for
connie
went
to
bed
early
as
indeed
we
all
did
and
she
was
rather
better
than
worse
the
next
morning
my
wife
for
the
first
time
for
many
nights
said
nothing
about
the
crying
of
the
sea
the
following
day
turner
and
i
set
out
to
explore
the
neighbourhood
the
rest
remained
quietly
at
home
it
was
as
i
have
said
a
high
bare
country
the
fields
lay
side
by
side
parted
from
each
other
chiefly
as
so
often
in
scotland
by
stone
walls
and
these
stones
being
of
a
laminated
nature
the
walls
were
not
unfrequently
built
by
laying
thin
plates
on
their
edges
which
gave
a
neatness
to
them
not
found
in
other
parts
of
the
country
as
far
as
i
am
aware
in
the
middle
of
the
fields
came
here
and
there
patches
of
yet
unreclaimed
moorland
now
in
a
region
like
this
beauty
must
be
looked
for
below
the
surface
there
is
a
probability
of
finding
hollows
of
repose
sunken
spots
of
loveliness
hidden
away
altogether
from
the
general
aspect
of
sternness
or
perhaps
sterility
that
meets
the
eye
in
glancing
over
the
outspread
landscape
just
as
in
the
natures
of
stern
men
you
may
expect
to
find
if
opportunity
should
be
afforded
you
sunny
spots
of
tender
verdure
kept
ever
green
by
that
very
sternness
which
is
turned
towards
the
common
gaze
thus
existent
because
they
are
below
the
surface
and
not
laid
bare
to
the
sweep
of
the
cold
winds
that
roam
the
world
how
often
have
not
men
started
with
amaze
at
the
discovery
of
some
feminine
sweetness
some
grace
of
protection
in
the
man
whom
they
had
judged
cold
and
hard
and
rugged
inaccessible
to
the
more
genial
influences
of
humanity
it
may
be
that
such
men
are
only
fighting
against
the
wind
and
keep
their
hearts
open
to
the
sun
i
knew
this
and
when
turner
and
i
set
out
that
morning
to
explore
i
expected
to
light
upon
some
instance
of
it
some
mine
or
other
in
which
nature
had
hidden
away
rare
jewels
but
i
was
not
prepared
to
find
such
as
i
did
find
with
our
hearts
full
of
a
glad
secret
we
returned
home
but
we
said
nothing
about
it
in
order
that
ethelwyn
and
wynnie
might
enjoy
the
discovery
even
as
we
had
enjoyed
it
there
was
another
grand
fact
with
regard
to
the
neighbourhood
about
which
we
judged
it
better
to
be
silent
for
a
few
days
that
the
inland
influences
might
be
free
to
work
we
were
considerably
nearer
the
ocean
than
my
wife
and
daughters
supposed
for
we
had
made
a
great
round
in
order
to
arrive
from
the
we
were
however
out
of
the
sound
of
its
waves
which
broke
all
along
the
shore
in
this
part
at
the
foot
of
tremendous
cliffs
what
cliffs
they
were
we
shall
soon
find
chapter
viii
the
keeve
now
my
dear
now
wynnie
i
said
after
prayers
the
next
morning
you
must
come
out
for
a
walk
as
soon
as
ever
you
can
get
your
bonnets
but
we
can
t
leave
connie
papa
objected
wynnie
o
yes
you
can
quite
well
there
s
nursie
to
look
after
her
what
do
you
say
connie
for
for
some
time
now
connie
had
been
able
to
get
up
so
early
that
it
was
no
unusual
thing
to
have
prayers
in
her
room
i
am
entirely
independent
of
help
from
my
family
returned
connie
grandiloquently
i
am
a
woman
of
independent
means
she
added
if
you
say
another
word
i
will
rise
and
leave
the
and
she
made
a
movement
as
if
she
would
actually
do
as
she
had
said
seized
with
an
involuntary
terror
i
rushed
towards
her
and
the
impertinent
girl
burst
out
laughing
in
my
face
threw
herself
back
on
her
pillows
and
laughed
delightedly
take
care
papa
she
said
i
carry
a
terrible
club
for
rebellious
then
her
mood
changing
she
added
as
if
to
suppress
the
tears
gathering
in
her
eyes
i
am
the
queen
of
luxury
and
and
i
won
t
have
anybody
come
near
me
till
i
mean
to
enjoy
so
the
matter
was
settled
and
we
went
out
for
our
walk
ethelwyn
was
not
such
a
good
walker
as
she
had
been
but
even
if
she
had
retained
the
strength
of
her
youth
we
should
not
have
got
on
much
the
better
for
it
so
often
did
she
and
wynnie
stop
to
grub
ferns
out
of
the
chinks
and
roots
of
the
now
i
admire
ferns
as
much
as
anybody
that
is
not
i
fear
so
much
as
my
wife
and
daughter
but
quite
enough
notwithstanding
but
i
do
not
quite
enjoy
being
pulled
up
like
a
fern
at
every
turn
now
my
dear
what
is
the
use
of
stopping
to
torture
that
harmless
vegetable
i
say
but
say
in
vain
it
is
much
more
beautiful
where
it
is
than
it
will
be
anywhere
where
you
can
put
it
besides
you
know
they
never
come
to
anything
with
you
they
thereupon
my
wife
reminds
me
of
this
fern
and
that
fern
gathered
in
such
and
such
places
and
now
in
such
and
such
corners
of
the
garden
or
the
greenhouse
or
under
in
this
or
that
room
of
the
very
existence
of
which
i
am
ignorant
whether
from
original
inattention
or
merely
from
forgetfulness
i
do
not
know
certainly
out
of
their
own
place
i
do
not
care
much
for
them
at
length
partly
by
the
inducement
i
held
out
to
them
of
a
much
greater
variety
of
ferns
where
we
were
bound
i
succeeded
in
getting
them
over
the
two
miles
in
little
more
than
two
hours
after
passing
from
the
lanes
into
the
fields
our
way
led
downwards
till
we
reached
a
very
steep
large
slope
with
a
delightful
southern
exposure
and
covered
with
the
sweetest
it
was
just
the
place
to
lie
in
as
on
the
edge
of
the
earth
and
look
abroad
upon
the
universe
of
air
and
floating
worlds
let
us
have
a
rest
here
ethel
i
said
i
am
sure
this
is
much
more
delightful
than
uprooting
ferns
what
an
awful
thing
to
think
that
here
we
are
on
this
great
round
tumbling
ball
of
a
world
held
by
the
feet
and
lifting
up
the
head
into
infinite
space
without
choice
or
wish
of
our
own
compelled
to
think
and
to
be
whether
we
will
or
not
just
god
must
know
it
to
be
very
good
or
he
would
not
have
taken
it
in
his
hands
to
make
individual
lives
without
a
possible
will
of
theirs
he
must
be
our
father
or
we
are
wretched
creatures
the
slaves
of
a
fatal
necessity
did
it
ever
strike
you
turner
that
each
one
of
us
stands
on
the
apex
of
the
world
with
a
sphere
you
know
it
must
be
so
and
thus
is
typified
as
it
seems
to
me
that
each
one
of
us
must
look
up
for
himself
to
find
god
and
then
look
abroad
to
find
his
i
think
i
know
what
you
mean
was
all
turner
s
reply
no
doubt
i
resumed
the
apprehension
of
this
truth
has
in
otherwise
minds
given
rise
to
all
sorts
of
fierce
and
grotesque
fanaticism
but
the
minds
which
have
thus
conceived
the
truth
would
have
been
immeasurably
worse
without
it
nay
this
truth
affords
at
last
the
only
possible
door
out
of
the
miseries
of
their
own
chaos
whether
inherited
or
the
result
of
their
own
what
s
that
in
the
grass
cried
wynnie
in
a
tone
of
alarm
i
looked
where
she
indicated
and
saw
a
or
lying
basking
in
the
sun
i
rose
and
went
towards
it
here
s
your
stick
said
turner
what
for
i
asked
why
should
i
kill
it
it
is
perfectly
harmless
and
to
my
mind
i
took
it
in
my
hands
and
brought
it
to
my
wife
she
gave
an
involuntary
shudder
as
it
came
near
her
i
assure
you
it
is
harmless
i
said
though
it
has
a
forked
and
i
opened
its
mouth
as
i
spoke
i
do
not
think
the
serpent
form
is
essentially
it
makes
me
feel
ugly
said
wynnie
i
allow
i
do
not
quite
understand
the
mystery
of
it
i
said
but
you
never
saw
lovelier
ornamentation
than
these
silvery
scales
with
all
the
neatness
of
what
you
ladies
call
a
set
pattern
and
none
of
the
stiffness
for
there
are
not
two
of
them
the
same
in
form
and
you
never
saw
lovelier
curves
than
this
little
patient
creature
which
does
not
even
try
to
get
away
from
me
makes
with
the
queer
long
thin
body
of
i
wonder
how
it
can
look
after
its
tail
it
is
so
far
off
said
wynnie
it
does
though
better
than
you
ladies
look
after
your
long
dresses
i
wonder
whether
it
is
descended
from
creatures
that
once
had
feet
and
did
not
make
a
good
use
of
them
perhaps
they
had
wings
even
and
would
not
use
them
at
all
and
so
lost
them
its
ancestors
may
have
had
it
is
innocent
enough
but
it
is
a
terrible
thing
to
be
all
feet
is
it
not
there
is
an
awful
significance
in
the
condemnation
of
the
serpent
on
thy
belly
shalt
thou
go
and
eat
but
it
is
better
to
talk
of
beautiful
things
soul
at
least
has
dropped
from
its
world
apex
let
us
go
on
come
wife
come
they
did
not
seem
willing
to
rise
but
the
glen
drew
me
i
rose
and
my
wife
followed
my
example
with
the
help
of
my
hand
she
returned
to
the
subject
however
as
we
descended
the
slope
is
it
possible
that
in
the
course
of
ever
so
many
ages
wings
and
feet
should
be
both
lost
she
said
the
most
presumptuous
thing
in
the
world
is
to
pronounce
on
the
possible
and
the
impossible
i
do
not
know
what
is
possible
and
what
is
impossible
i
can
only
tell
a
little
of
what
is
true
and
what
is
untrue
but
i
do
say
this
that
between
the
condition
of
many
decent
members
of
society
and
that
for
the
sake
of
which
god
made
them
there
is
a
gulf
quite
as
vast
as
that
between
a
serpent
and
a
bird
i
get
peeps
now
and
then
into
the
condition
of
my
own
heart
which
for
the
moment
make
it
seem
impossible
that
i
should
ever
rise
into
a
true
state
of
nature
that
is
into
the
simplicity
of
god
s
will
concerning
me
the
only
hope
for
ourselves
and
for
others
lies
in
him
in
the
power
the
creating
spirit
has
over
the
spirits
he
has
by
this
time
the
descent
on
the
grass
was
getting
too
steep
and
slippery
to
admit
of
our
continuing
to
advance
in
that
direction
we
turned
therefore
down
the
valley
in
the
direction
of
the
sea
it
was
but
a
narrow
cleft
and
narrowed
much
towards
a
deeper
cleft
in
which
we
now
saw
the
tops
of
trees
and
from
which
we
heard
the
rush
of
water
nor
had
we
gone
far
in
this
direction
before
we
came
upon
a
gate
in
a
stone
wall
which
led
into
what
seemed
a
neglected
garden
we
entered
and
found
a
path
turning
and
winding
among
small
trees
and
luxuriant
ferns
and
great
stones
and
fragments
of
ruins
down
towards
the
bottom
of
the
chasm
the
noise
of
falling
water
increased
as
we
went
on
and
at
length
after
some
scrambling
and
several
sharp
turns
we
found
ourselves
with
a
nearly
precipitous
wall
on
each
side
clothed
with
shrubs
and
ivy
and
creeping
things
of
the
vegetable
world
up
this
cleft
there
was
no
advance
the
head
of
it
was
a
precipice
down
which
shot
the
stream
from
the
vale
above
pouring
out
of
a
deep
slit
it
had
itself
cut
in
the
rock
as
with
a
knife
halfway
down
it
tumbled
into
a
great
basin
of
hollowed
stone
and
flowing
from
a
chasm
in
its
side
which
left
part
of
the
lip
of
the
basin
standing
like
the
arch
of
a
vanished
bridge
it
fell
into
a
black
pool
below
whence
it
crept
as
if
or
weary
down
the
gentle
decline
of
the
ravine
it
was
a
perfect
little
picture
i
for
my
part
had
never
seen
such
a
picturesque
fall
it
was
a
little
gem
of
nature
complete
in
effect
the
ladies
were
full
of
pleasure
wynnie
forgetting
her
usual
reserve
broke
out
in
frantic
exclamations
of
delight
we
stood
for
a
while
regarding
the
ceaseless
pour
of
the
water
down
the
precipice
here
shot
slanting
in
a
little
trough
of
the
rock
full
of
force
and
purpose
here
falling
in
great
curls
of
green
and
gray
with
an
expression
of
absolute
helplessness
and
conscious
perdition
as
if
sheer
to
the
centre
but
rejoicing
the
next
moment
to
find
itself
brought
up
boiling
and
bubbling
in
the
basin
to
issue
in
the
gathered
hope
of
experience
then
we
turned
down
the
stream
a
little
way
crossed
it
by
a
plank
and
stood
again
to
regard
it
from
the
opposite
side
small
as
the
whole
affair
was
not
more
than
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
in
height
it
was
so
full
of
variety
that
i
saw
it
was
all
my
memory
could
do
if
it
carried
away
anything
like
a
correct
picture
of
its
aspect
i
was
contemplating
it
fixedly
when
a
little
stifled
cry
from
wynnie
made
me
start
and
look
round
her
face
was
flushed
yet
she
was
trying
to
look
unconcerned
i
thought
we
were
quite
alone
papa
she
said
but
i
see
a
gentleman
i
looked
whither
she
indicated
a
little
way
down
the
bed
of
the
ravine
widened
considerably
and
was
no
doubt
filled
with
water
in
rainy
weather
now
it
was
swampy
full
of
reeds
and
willow
bushes
but
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
stream
with
a
little
canal
from
it
going
all
around
it
lay
a
great
flat
rectangular
stone
not
more
than
a
foot
above
the
level
of
the
water
and
upon
a
in
the
centre
of
this
stone
sat
a
gentleman
sketching
i
had
no
doubt
that
wynnie
had
recognised
him
at
once
and
i
was
annoyed
and
indeed
angry
to
think
that
percivale
had
followed
us
here
but
while
i
regarded
him
he
looked
up
rose
very
quietly
and
with
his
pencil
in
his
hand
came
towards
us
with
no
nearer
approach
to
familiarity
than
a
bow
and
no
expression
of
either
much
pleasure
or
any
surprise
he
said
i
have
seen
your
party
for
some
time
walton
since
you
crossed
the
stream
but
i
would
not
break
in
upon
your
enjoyment
with
the
surprise
which
my
presence
here
must
cause
i
suppose
i
answered
with
a
bow
of
some
sort
for
i
could
not
say
with
truth
that
i
was
glad
to
see
him
he
resumed
doubtless
penetrating
my
suspicion
i
have
been
here
almost
a
week
i
certainly
had
no
expectation
of
the
pleasure
of
seeing
this
he
said
lightly
though
no
doubt
with
the
object
of
clearing
himself
and
i
was
if
not
reassured
yet
disarmed
by
his
statement
for
i
could
not
believe
from
what
i
knew
of
him
that
he
would
be
guilty
of
such
a
white
lie
as
many
a
gentleman
would
have
thought
justifiable
on
the
occasion
still
i
suppose
he
found
me
a
little
stiff
for
presently
he
said
if
you
will
excuse
me
i
will
return
to
my
then
i
felt
as
if
i
must
say
something
for
i
had
shown
him
no
courtesy
during
the
interview
it
must
be
a
great
pleasure
to
carry
away
such
talismans
with
you
capable
of
bringing
the
place
back
to
your
mental
vision
at
any
to
tell
the
truth
he
answered
i
am
a
little
ashamed
of
being
found
sketching
here
such
bits
of
scenery
are
not
of
my
favourite
studies
but
it
is
a
it
is
very
beautiful
here
i
said
in
a
tone
of
contravention
it
is
very
pretty
he
answered
very
lovely
if
you
will
not
very
beautiful
i
think
i
would
keep
that
word
for
things
of
larger
regard
beauty
requires
width
and
here
is
none
i
had
almost
said
this
place
was
fanciful
the
work
of
imagination
in
her
not
in
her
large
serious
moods
it
affects
me
like
the
face
of
a
woman
only
pretty
about
which
boys
and
guardsmen
will
rave
to
me
not
very
interesting
save
for
its
single
why
then
do
you
sketch
the
place
a
very
fair
question
he
returned
with
a
smile
just
because
it
is
soothing
from
the
very
absence
of
beauty
i
would
far
rather
however
if
i
were
only
following
my
taste
take
the
barest
bit
of
the
moor
above
with
a
streak
of
the
cold
sky
over
it
that
gives
you
would
like
to
put
a
skylark
in
it
wouldn
t
you
that
i
would
if
i
knew
how
i
see
you
know
what
i
mean
but
the
mere
romantic
i
never
had
much
taste
for
though
if
you
saw
the
kind
of
pictures
i
try
to
paint
you
would
not
wonder
that
i
take
sketches
of
places
like
this
while
in
my
heart
of
hearts
i
do
not
care
much
for
them
they
are
so
different
and
just
they
are
good
for
me
i
am
not
working
now
i
am
only
with
a
view
to
working
better
afterwards
i
have
no
doubt
i
answered
you
are
right
there
i
hope
was
his
quiet
reply
as
he
turned
and
walked
back
to
the
island
he
had
not
made
a
step
towards
joining
us
he
had
only
taken
his
hat
off
to
the
ladies
he
was
gaining
ground
upon
me
rapidly
have
you
quarrelled
with
our
new
friend
harry
said
my
wife
as
i
came
up
to
her
she
was
sitting
on
a
stone
turner
and
wynnie
were
farther
off
towards
the
foot
of
the
fall
not
in
the
least
i
answered
slightly
outraged
i
did
not
at
first
know
why
by
the
question
he
is
only
gone
to
his
work
which
is
a
duty
belonging
both
to
the
first
and
second
tables
of
the
i
hope
you
have
asked
him
to
come
home
to
our
early
dinner
then
she
rejoined
i
have
not
that
remains
for
you
to
do
come
i
will
take
you
to
ethelwyn
rose
at
once
put
her
hand
in
mine
and
with
a
little
help
soon
reached
the
when
percivale
saw
that
she
was
really
on
a
visit
to
him
on
his
he
rose
and
when
she
came
near
enough
held
out
his
hand
it
was
but
a
step
and
she
was
beside
him
in
a
moment
after
the
usual
greetings
which
on
her
part
although
very
quiet
like
every
motion
and
word
of
hers
were
yet
indubitably
cordial
and
kind
she
said
when
you
get
back
to
london
percivale
might
i
ask
you
to
allow
some
friends
of
mine
to
call
at
your
studio
and
see
your
paintings
with
all
my
heart
answered
percivale
i
must
warn
you
however
that
i
have
not
much
they
will
care
to
see
they
will
perhaps
go
away
less
happy
than
they
entered
not
many
people
care
to
see
my
pictures
i
would
not
send
you
anyone
i
thought
unworthy
of
the
honour
answered
my
wife
percivale
bowed
one
of
his
stately
bows
which
i
greatly
liked
any
friend
of
yours
that
is
guarantee
sufficient
he
answered
there
was
this
peculiarity
about
any
compliment
that
percivale
paid
that
you
had
not
a
doubt
of
its
being
genuine
will
you
come
and
take
an
early
dinner
with
us
said
my
wife
my
invalid
daughter
will
be
very
pleased
to
see
i
will
with
pleasure
he
answered
but
in
a
tone
of
some
hesitation
as
he
glanced
from
ethelwyn
to
me
my
wife
speaks
for
us
all
i
said
it
will
give
us
all
i
am
only
afraid
it
will
break
in
upon
your
morning
s
work
remarked
ethelwyn
o
that
is
not
of
the
least
consequence
he
rejoined
in
fact
as
i
have
just
been
saying
to
walton
i
am
not
working
at
all
at
present
this
is
pure
as
he
spoke
he
turned
towards
his
easel
and
began
hastily
to
bundle
up
his
things
we
re
not
quite
ready
to
go
yet
said
my
wife
loath
to
leave
the
lovely
spot
what
a
curious
flat
stone
this
is
she
added
it
is
said
percivale
the
man
to
whom
the
place
belongs
a
worthy
yeoman
of
the
old
school
says
that
this
wider
part
of
the
channel
must
have
been
the
and
that
the
portly
monks
stood
on
this
stone
and
fished
in
the
then
was
there
a
monastery
here
i
asked
certainly
the
ruins
of
the
chapel
one
of
the
smallest
are
on
the
top
just
above
the
fall
rather
a
fearful
place
to
look
down
from
i
wonder
you
did
not
observe
them
as
you
came
they
say
it
had
a
silver
bell
in
the
days
of
its
glory
which
now
lies
in
a
deep
hole
under
the
basin
between
the
top
and
bottom
of
the
fall
but
the
old
man
says
that
nothing
will
make
him
look
or
let
anyone
else
lift
the
huge
stone
for
he
is
much
better
pleased
to
believe
that
it
may
be
there
than
he
would
be
to
know
it
was
not
there
for
certainly
if
it
were
found
it
would
not
be
left
there
as
he
spoke
percivale
had
continued
packing
his
gear
he
now
led
our
party
up
to
the
chapel
and
thence
down
a
few
yards
to
the
edge
of
the
chasm
where
the
water
fell
headlong
i
turned
away
with
that
fear
of
high
places
which
is
one
of
my
many
weaknesses
and
when
i
turned
again
towards
the
spot
there
was
wynnie
on
the
very
edge
looking
over
into
the
flash
and
tumult
of
the
water
below
but
with
a
nervous
grasp
of
the
hand
of
percivale
who
stood
a
little
farther
back
in
going
home
the
painter
led
us
by
an
easier
way
out
of
the
valley
left
his
little
easel
and
other
things
at
a
cottage
and
then
walked
on
in
front
between
my
wife
and
daughter
while
turner
and
i
followed
he
seemed
quite
at
his
ease
with
them
and
plenty
of
talk
and
laughter
rose
on
the
way
i
however
was
chiefly
occupied
with
finding
out
turner
s
impression
of
connie
s
condition
she
is
certainly
better
he
said
i
wonder
you
do
not
see
it
as
plainly
as
i
do
the
pain
is
nearly
gone
from
her
spine
and
she
can
move
herself
a
good
deal
more
i
am
certain
than
she
could
when
she
left
she
asked
me
yesterday
if
she
might
not
turn
upon
one
side
do
you
think
you
could
i
i
think
so
she
answered
at
any
rate
i
have
often
a
great
inclination
to
try
only
papa
said
i
had
better
wait
till
you
i
do
think
she
might
be
allowed
a
little
more
change
of
posture
then
you
have
really
some
hope
of
her
final
recovery
i
have
most
certainly
but
what
is
hope
in
me
you
must
not
allow
to
become
certainty
in
you
i
am
nearly
sure
though
that
she
can
never
be
other
than
an
invalid
that
is
if
i
am
to
judge
by
what
i
know
of
such
i
am
thankful
for
the
hope
i
answered
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
my
turning
upon
you
should
the
hope
never
pass
into
sight
i
should
do
so
only
if
i
found
that
you
had
been
treating
me
irrationally
inspiring
me
with
hope
which
you
knew
to
be
false
the
element
of
uncertainty
is
essential
to
hope
and
for
all
true
hope
even
as
hope
man
has
to
be
unspeakably
chapter
ix
the
walk
to
church
i
was
glad
to
be
able
to
arrange
with
a
young
clergyman
who
was
on
a
visit
to
kilkhaven
that
he
should
take
my
duty
for
me
the
next
sunday
for
that
was
the
only
one
turner
could
spend
with
us
he
and
i
and
wynnie
walked
together
two
miles
to
church
it
was
a
lovely
morning
with
just
a
tint
of
autumn
in
the
air
but
even
that
tint
though
all
else
was
of
the
summer
brought
a
shadow
i
could
see
on
wynnie
s
face
you
said
you
would
show
me
a
poem
of
vaughan
i
think
you
said
was
the
name
of
the
writer
i
am
too
ignorant
of
our
older
literature
said
turner
i
have
only
just
made
acquaintance
with
him
i
answered
but
i
think
i
can
repeat
the
poem
you
shall
judge
whether
it
is
not
like
wordsworth
s
ode
happy
those
early
days
when
i
shined
in
my
angel
infancy
before
i
understood
the
place
appointed
for
my
second
race
or
taught
my
soul
to
fancy
ought
but
a
white
celestial
thought
when
yet
i
had
not
walked
above
a
mile
or
two
from
my
first
love
and
looking
back
at
that
short
space
could
see
a
glimpse
of
his
bright
face
when
on
some
gilded
cloud
or
flower
my
gazing
soul
would
dwell
an
hour
and
in
those
weaker
glories
spy
some
shadows
of
eternity
before
i
taught
my
tongue
to
wound
my
conscience
with
a
sinful
sound
but
felt
through
all
this
fleshly
dress
bright
shoots
of
everlastingness
o
how
i
long
to
travel
back
but
here
i
broke
down
for
i
could
not
remember
the
rest
with
even
approximate
accuracy
when
did
this
vaughan
live
asked
turner
he
was
born
i
find
in
five
years
that
is
after
shakspere
s
death
and
when
milton
was
about
thirteen
years
old
he
lived
to
the
age
of
but
seems
to
have
been
little
known
in
politics
he
was
on
the
cavalier
side
by
the
way
he
was
a
medical
man
like
you
turner
an
we
ll
have
a
glance
at
the
little
book
when
we
go
back
don
t
let
me
forget
to
show
it
you
a
good
many
of
your
profession
have
distinguished
themselves
in
literature
and
as
profound
believers
i
should
have
thought
the
profession
had
been
chiefly
remarkable
for
such
as
believe
only
in
the
evidence
of
the
as
if
having
searched
into
the
innermost
recesses
of
the
body
and
not
having
found
a
soul
they
considered
themselves
justified
in
declaring
there
was
just
well
that
is
true
of
the
commonplace
amongst
them
i
do
believe
you
will
find
the
exceptions
have
been
men
of
fine
minds
and
characters
not
such
as
he
of
whom
chaucer
says
his
study
was
but
little
on
the
bible
for
if
you
look
at
the
rest
of
the
description
of
the
man
you
will
find
that
he
was
in
alliance
with
his
apothecary
for
their
mutual
advantage
that
he
was
a
man
and
that
some
of
chaucer
s
keenest
irony
is
spent
on
him
in
an
quiet
manner
compare
the
tone
in
which
he
writes
of
the
doctor
of
physic
with
the
profound
reverence
wherewith
he
bows
himself
before
the
poor
here
wynnie
spoke
though
with
some
tremor
in
her
voice
i
never
know
papa
what
people
mean
by
talking
about
childhood
in
that
way
i
never
seem
to
have
been
a
bit
younger
and
more
innocent
than
i
don
t
you
remember
a
time
wynnie
when
the
things
about
you
the
sky
and
the
earth
say
seemed
to
you
much
grander
than
they
seem
now
you
are
old
enough
to
have
lost
she
thought
for
a
little
while
before
she
answered
my
dreams
were
i
know
i
can
not
say
so
of
anything
i
in
my
turn
had
to
be
silent
for
i
did
not
see
the
true
answer
though
i
was
sure
there
was
one
somewhere
if
i
could
only
find
it
all
i
could
reply
however
even
after
i
had
meditated
a
good
while
was
and
perhaps
after
all
it
was
the
best
thing
i
could
have
said
then
you
must
make
a
good
use
of
your
dreams
my
why
papa
because
they
are
the
only
memorials
of
childhood
you
have
how
am
i
to
make
a
good
use
of
them
i
don
t
know
what
to
do
with
my
silly
old
but
she
gave
a
sigh
as
she
spoke
that
testified
her
silly
old
dreams
had
a
charm
for
her
still
if
your
dreams
my
child
have
ever
testified
to
you
of
a
condition
of
things
beyond
that
which
you
see
around
you
if
they
have
been
to
you
the
hints
of
a
wonder
and
glory
beyond
what
visits
you
now
you
must
not
call
them
silly
for
they
are
just
what
the
scents
of
paradise
borne
on
the
air
were
to
adam
and
eve
as
they
delved
and
spun
reminding
them
that
they
must
aspire
yet
again
through
labour
into
that
childhood
of
obedience
which
is
the
only
paradise
of
humanity
into
that
oneness
with
the
will
of
the
father
which
our
race
our
individual
selves
need
just
as
much
as
if
we
had
personally
fallen
with
adam
and
from
which
we
fall
every
time
we
are
disobedient
to
the
voice
of
the
father
within
our
souls
to
the
conscience
which
is
his
making
and
his
witness
if
you
have
had
no
childhood
my
wynnie
yet
permit
your
old
father
to
say
that
everything
i
see
in
you
indicates
more
strongly
in
you
than
in
most
people
that
it
is
this
childhood
after
which
you
are
blindly
longing
without
which
you
find
that
life
is
hardly
to
be
endured
thank
god
for
your
dreams
my
child
in
him
you
will
find
that
the
essence
of
those
dreams
is
fulfilled
we
are
saved
by
hope
turner
never
man
hoped
too
much
or
repented
that
he
had
hoped
the
plague
is
that
we
don
t
hope
in
god
half
enough
the
very
fact
that
hope
is
strength
and
strength
the
outcome
the
body
of
life
shows
that
hope
is
at
one
with
life
with
the
very
essence
of
what
says
i
am
yea
of
what
doubts
and
says
am
i
and
therefore
is
reasonable
to
creatures
who
can
not
even
doubt
save
in
that
they
by
this
time
for
i
have
of
course
only
given
the
outlines
or
rather
salient
points
of
our
conversation
we
had
reached
the
church
where
if
i
found
the
sermon
neither
healing
nor
inspiring
i
found
the
prayers
full
of
hope
and
consolation
they
at
least
are
safe
beyond
human
caprice
conceit
or
incapacity
upon
them
too
the
man
who
is
distressed
at
the
thought
of
how
little
of
the
needful
food
he
had
been
able
to
provide
for
his
people
may
fall
back
for
comfort
in
the
thought
that
there
at
least
was
what
ought
to
have
done
them
good
what
it
was
well
worth
their
while
to
go
to
church
for
but
i
did
think
they
were
too
long
for
any
individual
christian
soul
to
sympathise
with
from
beginning
to
end
that
is
to
respond
to
like
to
the
fingered
key
in
every
touch
of
the
utterance
of
the
general
christian
soul
for
my
reader
must
remember
that
it
is
one
thing
to
read
prayers
and
another
to
respond
and
that
i
had
had
very
few
opportunities
of
being
in
the
position
of
the
latter
duty
i
had
had
suspicions
before
and
now
they
were
confirmed
that
the
present
crowding
of
services
was
most
inexpedient
and
as
i
pondered
on
the
matter
instead
of
trying
to
go
on
praying
after
i
had
already
uttered
my
soul
which
is
but
a
heathenish
attempt
after
much
speaking
i
thought
how
our
lord
had
given
us
such
a
short
prayer
to
pray
and
i
began
to
wonder
when
or
how
the
services
came
to
be
so
heaped
the
one
on
the
back
of
the
other
as
they
now
were
no
doubt
many
people
defended
them
no
doubt
many
people
could
sit
them
out
but
how
many
people
could
pray
from
beginning
to
end
of
them
i
on
this
point
we
had
some
talk
as
we
went
home
wynnie
was
opposed
to
any
change
of
the
present
use
on
the
ground
that
we
should
only
have
the
longer
sermons
still
i
said
i
do
not
think
even
that
so
great
an
evil
a
sensitive
conscience
will
not
reproach
itself
so
much
for
not
listening
to
the
whole
of
a
sermon
as
for
kneeling
in
prayer
and
not
praying
i
think
myself
however
that
after
the
prayers
are
over
everyone
should
be
at
liberty
to
go
out
and
leave
the
sermon
unheard
if
he
pleases
i
think
the
result
would
be
in
the
end
a
good
one
both
for
parson
and
people
it
would
break
through
the
deadness
of
this
custom
this
use
and
wont
many
a
young
mind
is
turned
for
life
against
the
influences
of
one
of
the
most
sacred
influences
when
that
is
with
just
by
the
feeling
that
he
do
so
and
so
that
he
must
go
through
a
certain
round
of
duty
it
is
a
willing
service
that
the
lord
wants
no
forced
devotions
are
either
acceptable
to
him
or
other
than
injurious
to
the
worshipper
if
such
he
can
be
after
an
early
dinner
i
said
to
turner
come
out
with
me
and
we
will
read
that
poem
of
vaughan
s
in
which
i
broke
down
o
papa
said
connie
in
a
tone
of
injury
from
the
sofa
what
is
it
my
dear
i
asked
wouldn
t
it
be
as
good
for
us
as
for
turner
quite
my
dear
well
i
will
keep
it
for
the
evening
and
meantime
turner
and
i
will
go
and
see
if
we
can
find
out
anything
about
the
change
in
the
for
i
had
thrown
into
my
bag
as
i
left
the
rectory
a
copy
of
clergyman
s
vade
a
treatise
occupied
with
the
externals
of
the
churchman
s
relations
in
which
i
soon
came
upon
the
following
passage
so
then
it
appears
that
the
common
practice
of
reading
all
three
together
is
an
innovation
and
if
an
ancient
or
infirm
clergyman
do
read
them
at
two
or
three
several
times
he
is
more
strictly
conformable
however
this
is
much
better
than
to
omit
any
part
of
the
liturgy
or
to
read
all
three
offices
into
one
as
is
now
commonly
done
without
any
pause
or
on
the
part
of
the
clergyman
you
see
turner
i
said
when
i
had
finished
reading
the
whole
passage
to
him
there
is
no
care
taken
of
the
delicate
women
of
the
congregation
but
only
of
the
ancient
or
infirm
clergyman
and
the
logic
to
say
the
least
is
rather
queer
is
it
only
in
virtue
of
his
antiquity
and
infirmity
that
he
is
to
be
upheld
in
being
more
strictly
conformable
the
writer
s
honesty
has
its
heels
trodden
upon
by
the
fear
of
giving
offence
nevertheless
there
should
perhaps
be
a
certain
slowness
to
admit
change
even
back
to
a
more
ancient
i
don
t
know
that
i
can
quite
agree
with
you
there
said
turner
if
the
form
is
better
no
one
should
hesitate
to
advocate
the
change
if
it
is
worse
then
slowness
is
not
sufficient
utter
obstinacy
is
the
right
you
are
right
turner
for
the
right
must
be
the
rule
and
where
is
beyond
our
understanding
or
our
reach
then
as
indeed
not
only
right
compared
with
the
other
but
the
sole
ascent
towards
the
in
the
evening
i
took
henry
vaughan
s
poems
into
the
common
and
to
connie
s
great
delight
read
the
whole
of
the
lovely
though
unequal
little
poem
called
the
retreat
in
recalling
which
i
had
failed
in
the
morning
she
was
especially
delighted
with
the
white
celestial
thought
and
the
bright
shoots
of
then
i
gave
a
few
lines
from
another
yet
more
unequal
poem
worthy
in
themselves
of
the
best
of
the
other
i
quote
the
first
strophe
entire
childhood
i
can
not
reach
it
and
my
striving
eye
dazzles
at
it
as
at
eternity
were
now
that
chronicle
alive
those
white
designs
which
children
drive
and
the
thoughts
of
each
harmless
hour
with
their
content
too
in
my
power
quickly
would
i
make
my
path
even
and
by
mere
playing
go
to
heaven
and
yet
the
practice
worldlings
call
business
and
weighty
action
all
checking
the
poor
child
for
his
play
but
gravely
cast
themselves
away
an
age
of
mysteries
which
he
must
live
twice
that
would
god
s
face
see
which
angels
guard
and
with
it
play
angels
which
foul
men
drive
away
how
do
i
study
now
and
scan
thee
more
than
ere
i
studied
man
and
only
see
through
a
long
night
thy
edges
and
thy
bordering
light
i
o
for
thy
centre
and
midday
for
sure
that
is
the
way
for
of
such
is
the
kingdom
of
said
my
wife
softly
as
i
closed
the
book
may
i
have
the
book
papa
said
connie
holding
out
her
thin
white
cloud
of
a
hand
to
take
it
certainly
my
child
and
if
wynnie
would
read
it
with
you
she
will
feel
more
of
the
truth
of
what
percivale
was
saying
to
her
about
finish
here
are
the
finest
grandest
thoughts
set
forth
sometimes
with
such
carelessness
at
least
such
lack
of
neatness
that
instead
of
their
falling
on
the
mind
with
all
their
power
of
loveliness
they
are
like
a
beautiful
face
disfigured
with
patches
and
what
is
worse
they
put
the
mind
out
of
the
right
quiet
unquestioning
open
mood
which
is
the
only
fit
one
for
the
reception
of
such
true
things
as
are
embodied
in
the
poems
but
they
are
too
beautiful
after
all
to
be
more
than
a
little
spoiled
by
such
a
lack
of
the
finish
with
which
art
ends
off
all
her
labours
a
gentleman
however
thinks
it
of
no
little
importance
to
have
his
nails
nice
as
well
as
his
face
and
his
chapter
x
the
old
castle
the
place
turner
had
chosen
suited
us
all
so
well
that
after
attending
to
my
duties
on
the
two
following
sundays
at
kilkhaven
i
returned
on
the
monday
or
tuesday
to
the
farmhouse
but
turner
left
us
in
the
middle
of
the
second
week
for
he
could
not
be
longer
absent
from
his
charge
at
home
and
we
missed
him
much
it
was
some
days
before
connie
was
quite
as
cheerful
again
as
usual
i
do
not
mean
that
she
was
in
the
least
gloomy
that
she
never
was
she
was
only
a
little
less
merry
but
whether
it
was
that
turner
had
opened
our
eyes
or
that
she
had
visibly
improved
since
he
allowed
her
to
make
a
little
change
in
her
posture
certainly
she
appeared
to
us
to
have
made
considerable
progress
and
every
now
and
then
we
were
discovering
some
little
proof
of
the
fact
one
evening
while
we
were
still
at
the
farm
she
startled
us
by
calling
out
suddenly
papa
papa
i
moved
my
big
toe
i
did
we
were
all
about
her
in
a
moment
but
i
saw
that
she
was
excited
and
fearing
a
reaction
i
sought
to
calm
her
but
my
dear
i
said
as
quietly
as
i
could
you
are
probably
still
aware
that
you
are
possessed
of
two
big
toes
which
of
them
are
we
to
congratulate
on
this
first
stride
in
the
march
of
improvement
she
broke
out
in
the
merriest
laugh
a
pause
followed
in
which
her
face
wore
a
puzzled
expression
then
she
said
all
at
once
papa
it
is
very
odd
but
i
can
t
tell
which
of
them
and
burst
into
tears
i
was
afraid
that
i
had
done
more
harm
than
good
it
is
not
of
the
slightest
consequence
my
child
i
said
you
have
had
so
little
communication
with
the
twins
of
late
that
it
is
no
wonder
you
should
not
be
able
to
tell
the
one
from
the
she
smiled
again
through
her
sobs
but
was
silent
with
shining
face
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
our
hopes
took
a
fresh
start
but
we
heard
no
more
from
her
of
her
power
over
her
big
toe
as
often
as
i
inquired
she
said
she
was
afraid
she
had
made
a
mistake
for
she
had
not
had
another
hint
of
its
existence
still
i
thought
it
could
not
have
been
a
fancy
and
i
would
cleave
to
my
belief
in
the
good
sign
percivale
called
to
see
us
several
times
but
always
appeared
anxious
not
to
intrude
more
of
his
society
upon
us
than
might
be
agreeable
he
grew
in
my
regard
however
and
at
length
i
asked
him
if
he
would
assist
me
in
another
surprise
which
i
meditated
for
my
companions
and
this
time
for
connie
as
well
and
which
i
hoped
would
prevent
the
painful
influences
of
the
sight
of
the
sea
from
returning
upon
them
when
they
went
back
to
kilkhaven
they
must
see
the
sea
from
a
quite
different
shore
first
in
a
word
i
would
take
them
to
tintagel
of
the
near
position
of
which
they
were
not
aware
although
in
some
of
our
walks
we
had
seen
the
ocean
in
the
distance
an
early
day
was
fixed
for
carrying
out
our
project
and
i
proceeded
to
get
everything
ready
the
only
difficulty
was
to
find
a
carriage
in
the
neighbourhood
suitable
for
receiving
connie
s
litter
in
this
however
i
at
length
succeeded
and
on
the
morning
of
a
glorious
day
of
blue
and
gold
we
set
out
for
the
little
village
of
trevenna
now
far
better
known
than
at
the
time
of
which
i
write
connie
had
been
out
every
day
since
she
came
now
in
one
part
of
the
fields
now
in
another
enjoying
the
expanse
of
earth
and
sky
but
she
had
had
no
drive
and
consequently
had
seen
no
variety
of
scenery
therefore
believing
she
was
now
thoroughly
able
to
bear
it
i
quite
reckoned
of
the
good
she
would
get
from
the
inevitable
excitement
we
resolved
however
after
finding
how
much
she
enjoyed
the
few
miles
drive
that
we
would
not
demand
more
of
her
strength
that
day
and
therefore
put
up
at
the
little
inn
where
after
ordering
dinner
percivale
and
i
left
the
ladies
and
sallied
forth
to
reconnoitre
we
walked
through
the
village
and
down
the
valley
beyond
sloping
steeply
between
hills
towards
the
sea
the
opening
closed
at
the
end
by
the
blue
of
the
ocean
below
and
the
more
ethereal
blue
of
the
sky
above
but
when
we
reached
the
mouth
of
the
valley
we
found
that
we
were
not
yet
on
the
shore
for
a
precipice
lay
between
us
and
the
little
beach
below
on
the
left
a
great
peninsula
of
rock
stood
out
into
the
sea
upon
which
rose
the
ruins
of
the
keep
of
tintagel
while
behind
on
the
mainland
stood
the
ruins
of
the
castle
itself
connected
with
the
other
only
by
a
narrow
isthmus
we
had
read
that
this
peninsula
had
once
been
an
island
and
that
the
two
parts
of
the
castle
were
formerly
connected
by
a
drawbridge
looking
up
at
the
great
gap
which
now
divided
the
two
portions
it
seemed
at
first
impossible
to
believe
that
they
had
ever
been
thus
united
but
a
little
reflection
cleared
up
the
mystery
the
fact
was
that
the
isthmus
of
half
the
height
of
the
two
parts
connected
by
it
had
been
formed
entirely
by
the
fall
of
portions
of
the
rock
and
soil
on
each
side
into
the
narrow
dividing
space
through
which
the
waters
of
the
atlantic
had
been
wont
to
sweep
and
now
the
fragments
of
walls
stood
on
the
very
verge
of
the
precipice
and
showed
that
large
portions
of
the
castle
itself
had
fallen
into
the
gulf
between
we
turned
to
the
left
along
the
edge
of
the
rock
and
so
by
a
narrow
path
reached
and
crossed
to
the
other
side
of
the
isthmus
we
then
found
that
the
path
led
to
the
foot
of
the
rock
formerly
island
of
the
keep
and
thence
in
a
zigzag
up
the
face
of
it
to
the
top
we
followed
it
and
after
a
great
climb
reached
a
door
in
a
modern
battlement
entering
we
found
ourselves
amidst
grass
and
ruins
haggard
with
age
we
turned
and
surveyed
the
path
by
which
we
had
come
it
was
steep
and
somewhat
difficult
but
the
outlook
was
glorious
it
was
indeed
one
of
god
s
mounts
of
vision
upon
which
we
stood
the
thought
o
that
connie
could
see
this
was
swelling
in
my
heart
when
percivale
broke
the
silence
not
with
any
remark
on
the
glory
around
us
but
with
the
commonplace
question
you
haven
t
got
your
man
with
you
i
think
walton
no
i
answered
we
thought
it
better
to
leave
him
to
look
after
the
he
was
silent
for
a
few
minutes
while
i
gazed
in
delight
don
t
you
think
he
said
it
would
be
possible
to
bring
miss
constance
up
here
i
almost
started
at
the
idea
and
had
not
replied
before
he
resumed
it
would
be
something
for
her
to
recur
to
with
delight
all
the
rest
of
her
it
would
indeed
but
it
is
i
do
not
think
so
if
you
would
allow
me
the
honour
to
assist
you
i
think
we
could
do
it
perfectly
between
i
was
again
silent
for
a
while
looking
down
on
the
way
we
had
come
it
seemed
an
almost
dreadful
undertaking
percivale
spoke
again
as
we
shall
come
here
we
need
not
explore
the
place
now
shall
we
go
down
at
once
and
observe
the
whole
path
with
a
view
to
the
practicability
of
carrying
her
up
there
can
be
no
objection
to
that
i
answered
as
a
little
hope
and
courage
with
it
began
to
dawn
in
my
heart
but
you
must
allow
it
does
not
look
very
perhaps
it
would
seem
more
so
to
you
if
you
had
come
up
with
the
idea
in
your
head
all
the
way
as
i
did
any
path
seems
more
difficult
in
looking
back
than
at
the
time
when
the
difficulties
themselves
have
to
be
met
and
yes
but
then
you
must
remember
that
we
have
to
take
the
way
back
whether
we
will
or
no
if
we
once
take
the
way
true
and
now
i
will
go
down
with
the
descent
in
my
head
as
well
as
under
my
well
there
can
be
no
harm
in
reconnoitring
it
at
least
let
us
you
know
we
can
rest
almost
as
often
as
we
please
said
percivale
and
turned
to
lead
the
way
it
certainly
was
steep
and
required
care
even
in
our
own
descent
but
for
a
man
who
had
climbed
mountains
as
i
had
done
in
my
youth
it
could
hardly
be
called
difficult
even
in
middle
age
by
the
time
we
had
got
again
into
the
valley
road
i
was
all
but
convinced
of
the
practicability
of
the
proposal
i
was
a
little
vexed
however
i
must
confess
that
a
stranger
should
have
thought
of
giving
such
a
pleasure
to
connie
when
the
bare
wish
that
she
might
have
enjoyed
it
had
alone
arisen
in
my
mind
i
comforted
myself
with
the
reflection
that
this
was
one
of
the
ways
in
which
we
were
to
be
weaned
from
the
world
and
knit
the
faster
to
our
fellows
for
even
the
in
the
decay
of
their
daring
must
look
for
the
fresh
thought
and
the
fresh
impulse
to
the
youth
which
follows
at
their
heels
in
the
march
of
life
their
part
is
to
the
relation
and
the
obligation
and
so
by
love
to
and
faith
in
the
young
keep
themselves
in
the
line
along
which
the
electric
current
flows
till
at
length
they
too
shall
once
more
be
young
and
daring
in
the
strength
of
the
lord
a
man
must
always
seek
to
rise
above
his
moods
and
feelings
to
let
them
move
within
him
but
not
allow
them
to
storm
or
gloom
around
him
by
the
time
we
reached
home
we
had
agreed
to
make
the
attempt
and
to
judge
by
the
path
to
the
foot
of
the
rock
which
was
difficult
in
parts
whether
we
should
be
likely
to
succeed
without
danger
in
attempting
the
rest
of
the
way
and
the
following
descent
as
soon
as
we
had
arrived
at
this
conclusion
i
felt
so
happy
in
the
prospect
that
i
grew
quite
merry
especially
after
we
had
further
agreed
that
both
for
the
sake
of
her
nerves
and
for
the
sake
of
the
lordly
surprise
we
should
bind
connie
s
eyes
so
that
she
should
see
nothing
till
we
had
placed
her
in
a
certain
position
concerning
the
preferableness
of
which
we
were
not
of
two
minds
what
mischief
have
you
two
been
about
said
my
wife
as
we
entered
our
room
in
the
inn
where
the
cloth
was
already
laid
for
dinner
you
look
just
like
two
schoolboys
that
have
been
laying
some
plot
and
can
hardly
hold
their
tongues
about
we
have
been
enjoying
our
little
walk
amazingly
i
answered
so
much
so
that
we
mean
to
set
out
for
another
the
moment
dinner
is
i
hope
you
will
take
wynnie
with
you
or
you
my
love
i
returned
no
i
will
stay
with
very
well
you
and
connie
too
shall
go
out
for
we
have
found
a
place
we
want
to
take
you
to
and
indeed
i
believe
it
was
our
anticipation
of
the
pleasure
you
and
she
would
have
in
the
view
that
made
us
so
merry
when
you
accused
us
of
plotting
my
wife
replied
only
with
a
loving
look
and
dinner
appearing
at
this
moment
we
sat
down
a
happy
party
when
that
was
over
and
a
very
good
dinner
it
was
just
what
i
like
homely
in
material
but
admirable
in
cooking
wynnie
and
percivale
and
i
set
out
again
for
as
percivale
and
i
came
back
in
the
morning
we
had
seen
the
church
standing
far
aloft
and
aloof
on
the
other
side
of
the
little
valley
and
we
wanted
to
go
to
it
it
was
rather
a
steep
climb
and
wynnie
accepted
percivale
s
offered
arm
i
led
the
way
therefore
and
left
them
to
follow
not
so
far
in
the
rear
however
but
that
i
could
take
a
share
in
the
conversation
it
was
some
little
time
before
any
arose
and
it
was
wynnie
who
led
the
way
into
it
what
kind
of
things
do
you
like
best
to
paint
percivale
she
asked
he
hesitated
for
several
seconds
which
between
a
question
and
an
answer
look
so
long
that
most
people
would
call
them
minutes
i
would
rather
you
should
see
some
of
my
pictures
i
should
prefer
that
to
answering
your
question
he
said
at
length
but
i
have
seen
some
of
your
pictures
she
returned
pardon
me
indeed
you
have
not
miss
at
least
i
have
seen
some
of
your
sketches
and
some
of
my
sketches
none
of
my
but
you
make
use
of
your
sketches
for
your
pictures
do
you
not
never
of
such
as
you
have
seen
they
are
only
a
slight
antidote
to
my
i
can
not
understand
i
do
not
wonder
at
that
but
i
would
rather
i
repeat
say
nothing
about
my
pictures
till
you
see
some
of
but
how
am
i
to
have
that
pleasure
then
you
go
to
london
sometimes
do
you
not
very
rarely
more
rarely
still
when
the
royal
academy
is
that
does
not
matter
much
my
pictures
are
seldom
to
be
found
do
you
not
care
to
send
them
there
i
send
one
at
least
every
year
but
they
are
rarely
why
this
was
a
very
improper
question
i
thought
but
if
wynnie
had
thought
so
she
would
not
have
put
it
he
hesitated
a
little
before
he
replied
it
is
hardly
for
me
to
say
why
he
answered
but
i
can
not
wonder
much
at
it
considering
the
subjects
i
but
i
daresay
he
added
in
a
lighter
tone
after
all
that
has
little
to
do
with
it
and
there
is
something
about
the
things
themselves
that
precludes
a
favourable
judgment
i
avoid
thinking
about
it
a
man
ought
to
try
to
look
at
his
own
work
as
if
it
were
none
of
his
but
not
as
with
the
eyes
of
other
people
that
is
an
impossibility
and
the
attempt
a
bewilderment
it
is
with
his
own
eyes
he
must
look
with
his
own
judgment
he
must
judge
the
only
effort
is
to
get
it
set
far
away
enough
from
him
to
be
able
to
use
his
own
eyes
and
his
own
judgment
upon
i
think
i
see
what
you
mean
a
man
has
but
his
own
eyes
and
his
own
judgment
to
look
with
those
of
other
people
is
but
a
quite
so
you
understand
me
he
said
no
more
in
explanation
of
his
rejection
by
the
academy
till
we
reached
the
church
nothing
more
of
significance
passed
between
them
what
a
waste
bare
churchyard
that
was
it
had
two
or
three
but
they
had
no
roofs
they
were
just
small
enclosures
with
the
low
stone
tables
to
rest
the
living
from
the
weight
of
the
dead
while
the
clergyman
as
the
keeper
of
heaven
s
wardrobe
came
forth
to
receive
the
garment
they
restored
to
be
laid
aside
as
having
ended
its
work
as
having
been
worn
done
in
the
winds
and
rains
and
labours
of
the
world
not
a
tree
stood
in
that
churchyard
hank
grass
was
the
sole
covering
of
the
soil
heaved
up
with
the
dead
beneath
what
blasts
from
the
awful
space
of
the
sea
must
rush
athwart
the
undefended
garden
the
ancient
church
stood
in
the
midst
with
its
low
strong
square
tower
and
its
long
narrow
nave
the
ridge
bowed
with
age
like
the
back
of
a
horse
worn
out
in
the
service
of
man
and
its
little
homely
chancel
like
a
small
cottage
that
had
leaned
up
against
its
end
for
shelter
from
the
western
blasts
it
was
locked
and
we
could
not
enter
but
of
all
churches
that
one
sad
even
in
the
sunset
was
the
dreariest
i
had
ever
beheld
surely
it
needed
the
gospel
of
the
resurrection
fervently
preached
therein
to
keep
it
from
sinking
to
the
dust
with
dismay
and
weariness
such
a
soul
alone
could
keep
it
from
vanishing
utterly
of
dismal
old
age
near
it
was
one
huge
mound
of
rubbish
looking
like
the
grave
where
some
former
church
of
the
dead
had
been
buried
when
it
could
stand
erect
no
longer
before
the
onsets
of
atlantic
winds
i
walked
round
and
round
it
gathering
its
architecture
and
peeping
in
at
every
window
i
could
reach
suddenly
i
was
aware
that
i
was
alone
returning
to
the
other
side
i
found
that
percivale
was
seated
on
the
churchyard
wall
next
the
sea
it
would
have
been
less
dismal
had
it
stood
immediately
on
the
cliffs
but
they
were
at
some
little
distance
beyond
bare
downs
and
rough
stone
walls
he
was
sketching
the
place
and
wynnie
stood
beside
him
looking
over
his
shoulder
i
did
not
interrupt
him
but
walked
among
the
graves
reading
the
poor
memorials
of
the
dead
and
wondering
how
many
of
the
words
of
laudation
that
were
inscribed
on
their
tombs
were
spoken
of
them
while
they
were
yet
alive
yet
surely
in
the
lives
of
those
to
whom
they
applied
the
least
there
had
been
moments
when
the
true
nature
the
nature
god
had
given
them
broke
forth
in
faith
and
tenderness
and
would
have
justified
the
words
inscribed
on
their
gravestones
i
was
yet
wandering
and
reading
and
stumbling
over
the
mounds
when
my
companions
joined
me
and
without
a
word
we
walked
out
of
the
churchyard
we
were
nearly
home
before
one
of
us
spoke
that
church
is
oppressive
said
percivale
it
looks
like
a
great
sepulchre
a
place
built
only
for
the
dead
the
church
of
the
it
is
only
that
it
partakes
with
the
living
i
returned
suffers
with
them
the
buffetings
of
life
outlasts
them
but
shows
like
the
shield
of
the
knight
the
old
dints
of
deep
still
is
it
not
a
dreary
place
to
choose
for
a
church
to
stand
in
the
church
must
stand
everywhere
there
is
no
region
into
which
it
must
not
ought
not
to
enter
if
it
refuses
any
earthly
spot
it
is
shrinking
from
its
calling
here
this
one
stands
for
the
sea
as
for
the
land
looking
out
over
the
waters
as
a
sign
of
the
haven
from
all
storms
the
rest
in
god
and
down
beneath
in
its
storehouse
lie
the
bodies
of
men
you
saw
the
grave
of
some
of
them
on
the
other
side
flung
ashore
from
the
gulfing
sea
it
may
be
a
weakness
but
one
would
rather
have
the
bones
of
his
friend
laid
in
the
still
sabbath
of
the
churchyard
earth
than
sweeping
and
swaying
about
as
milton
imagines
the
bones
of
his
friend
edward
king
in
that
wonderful
then
i
told
them
the
conversation
i
had
had
with
the
sexton
at
kilkhaven
but
i
went
on
these
fancies
are
only
the
ghostly
mists
that
hang
about
the
eastern
hills
before
the
sun
rises
we
shall
look
down
on
all
that
with
a
smile
by
and
by
for
the
lord
tells
us
that
if
we
believe
in
him
we
shall
never
by
this
time
we
were
back
once
more
at
the
inn
we
gave
connie
a
description
of
what
we
had
seen
what
a
brave
old
church
said
connie
the
next
day
i
awoke
very
early
full
of
the
anticipated
attempt
i
got
up
at
once
found
the
weather
most
promising
and
proceeded
first
of
all
to
have
a
look
at
connie
s
litter
and
see
that
it
was
quite
sound
satisfied
of
this
i
rejoiced
in
the
contemplation
of
its
lightness
and
strength
after
breakfast
i
went
to
connie
s
room
and
told
her
that
percivale
and
i
had
devised
a
treat
for
her
her
face
shone
at
once
but
we
want
to
do
it
our
own
of
course
papa
she
answered
will
you
let
us
tie
your
eyes
up
yes
and
my
ears
and
my
hands
too
it
would
be
no
good
tying
my
feet
when
i
don
t
know
one
big
toe
from
the
and
she
laughed
merrily
we
ll
try
to
keep
up
the
talk
all
the
way
so
that
you
sha
n
t
weary
of
the
you
re
going
to
carry
me
somewhere
with
my
eyes
tied
up
o
how
jolly
and
then
i
shall
see
something
all
at
once
jolly
jolly
getting
tired
she
repeated
even
the
wind
on
my
face
would
be
pleasure
enough
for
half
a
day
i
sha
n
t
get
tired
so
soon
as
you
will
you
dear
kind
papa
i
am
afraid
i
shall
be
dreadfully
heavy
but
i
sha
n
t
jerk
your
arms
much
i
will
lie
so
still
and
you
won
t
mind
letting
percivale
help
me
to
carry
you
no
why
should
i
if
he
doesn
t
mind
it
he
looks
strong
enough
and
i
am
sure
he
is
nice
and
won
t
think
me
heavier
than
i
very
well
then
i
will
send
mamma
and
wynnie
to
dress
you
at
once
and
we
shall
set
out
as
soon
as
you
are
she
clapped
her
hands
with
delight
then
caught
me
round
the
neck
and
gave
me
one
of
my
own
kisses
as
she
called
the
best
she
had
and
began
to
call
as
loud
as
she
could
on
her
mamma
and
wynnie
to
come
and
dress
her
it
was
indeed
a
glorious
morning
the
wind
came
in
little
wafts
like
veins
of
cool
white
silver
amid
the
great
warm
yellow
gold
of
the
sunshine
the
sea
lay
before
us
a
mound
of
blue
closing
up
the
end
of
the
valley
as
if
overpowered
into
quietness
by
the
lordliness
of
the
sun
overhead
and
the
hills
between
which
we
went
lay
like
great
sheep
with
green
wool
basking
in
the
blissful
heat
the
gleam
from
the
waters
came
up
the
pass
the
grand
castle
crowned
the
steep
seeming
to
warm
its
old
bones
like
the
ruins
of
some
awful
megatherium
in
the
lighted
air
one
white
sail
sped
like
a
glad
thought
across
the
spandrel
of
the
sea
the
shadows
of
the
rocks
lay
over
our
path
like
transient
cool
benignant
deaths
through
which
we
had
to
pass
again
and
again
to
yet
higher
glory
beyond
and
one
lark
was
somewhere
in
whose
little
breast
the
whole
world
was
reflected
as
in
the
convex
mirror
of
a
dewdrop
where
it
swelled
so
that
he
could
not
hold
it
but
let
it
out
again
through
his
throat
metamorphosed
into
music
which
he
poured
forth
over
all
as
the
libation
on
the
outspread
altar
of
worship
and
of
all
this
we
talked
to
connie
as
we
went
and
every
now
and
then
she
would
clap
her
hands
gently
in
the
fulness
of
her
delight
although
she
beheld
the
splendour
only
as
with
her
ears
or
from
the
kisses
of
the
wind
on
her
cheeks
but
she
seemed
since
her
accident
to
have
approached
that
condition
which
milton
represents
samson
as
longing
for
in
his
blindness
wherein
the
sight
should
be
through
all
parts
diffused
that
she
might
look
at
will
through
every
i
had
however
arranged
with
the
rest
of
the
company
that
the
moment
we
reached
the
cliff
over
the
shore
and
turned
to
the
left
to
cross
the
isthmus
the
conversation
should
no
longer
be
about
the
things
around
us
and
especially
i
warned
my
wife
and
wynnie
that
no
exclamation
of
surprise
or
delight
should
break
from
them
before
connie
s
eyes
were
uncovered
i
had
said
nothing
to
either
of
them
about
the
difficulties
of
the
way
that
seeing
us
take
them
as
ordinary
things
they
might
take
them
so
too
and
not
be
uneasy
we
never
stopped
till
we
reached
the
foot
of
the
peninsula
island
upon
which
the
keep
of
tintagel
stands
there
we
set
connie
down
to
take
breath
and
ease
our
arms
before
we
began
the
arduous
way
now
now
said
connie
eagerly
lifting
her
hands
in
the
belief
that
we
were
on
the
point
of
undoing
the
bandage
from
her
eyes
no
no
my
love
not
yet
i
said
and
she
lay
still
again
only
she
looked
more
eager
than
before
i
am
afraid
i
have
tired
out
you
and
percivale
papa
she
said
percivale
laughed
so
amusedly
that
she
rejoined
roguishly
o
yes
i
know
every
gentleman
is
a
hercules
at
least
he
chooses
to
be
considered
one
but
notwithstanding
my
firm
faith
in
the
fact
i
have
a
little
womanly
conscience
left
that
is
hard
to
there
was
a
speech
for
my
wee
connie
to
make
the
best
answer
and
the
best
revenge
was
to
lift
her
and
go
on
this
we
did
trying
as
well
as
we
might
to
prevent
the
difference
of
level
between
us
from
tilting
the
litter
too
much
for
her
comfort
where
you
going
papa
she
said
once
but
without
a
sign
of
fear
in
her
voice
as
a
little
slip
i
made
lowered
my
end
of
the
litter
suddenly
you
must
be
going
up
a
steep
place
don
t
hurt
yourself
dear
we
had
changed
our
positions
and
were
now
carrying
her
head
foremost
up
the
hill
percivale
led
and
i
followed
now
i
could
see
every
change
on
her
lovely
face
and
it
made
me
strong
to
endure
for
i
did
find
it
hard
work
i
confess
to
get
to
the
top
it
lay
like
a
little
sunny
pool
on
which
all
the
cloudy
thoughts
that
moved
in
some
unseen
heaven
cast
exquisitely
delicate
changes
of
light
and
shade
as
they
floated
over
it
percivale
strode
on
as
if
he
bore
a
feather
behind
him
i
did
wish
we
were
at
the
top
for
my
arms
began
to
feel
like
stiff
and
stark
only
i
was
afraid
of
my
fingers
giving
way
my
heart
was
beating
uncomfortably
too
but
percivale
i
felt
almost
inclined
to
quarrel
with
him
before
it
was
over
he
strode
on
so
unconcernedly
turning
every
corner
of
the
zigzag
where
i
expected
him
to
propose
a
halt
and
striding
on
again
as
if
there
could
be
no
pretence
for
any
change
of
procedure
but
i
held
out
strengthened
by
the
play
on
my
daughter
s
face
delicate
as
the
play
on
an
opal
one
that
inclines
more
to
the
milk
than
the
fire
when
at
length
we
turned
in
through
the
gothic
door
in
the
battlemented
wall
and
set
our
lovely
burden
down
upon
the
grass
percivale
i
said
forgetting
the
proprieties
in
the
affected
humour
of
being
angry
with
him
so
glad
was
i
that
we
had
her
at
length
on
the
mount
of
glory
why
did
you
go
on
walking
like
a
castle
and
pay
no
heed
to
me
you
didn
t
speak
did
you
walton
he
returned
with
just
a
shadow
of
solicitude
in
the
question
no
of
course
not
i
rejoined
o
then
he
returned
in
a
tone
of
relief
how
could
i
you
were
my
captain
how
could
i
give
in
so
long
as
you
were
holding
on
i
am
afraid
the
without
the
came
again
and
again
after
this
though
i
pulled
myself
up
for
it
as
often
as
i
caught
myself
now
papa
said
connie
from
the
grass
not
yet
my
dear
wait
till
your
mamma
and
wynnie
come
let
us
go
and
meet
them
o
yes
do
papa
leave
me
alone
here
without
knowing
where
i
am
or
what
kind
of
a
place
i
am
in
i
should
like
to
know
how
it
feels
i
have
never
been
alone
in
all
my
very
well
my
dear
i
said
and
percivale
and
i
left
her
alone
in
the
ruins
we
found
ethelwyn
toiling
up
with
wynnie
helping
her
all
she
could
dear
harry
she
said
how
could
you
think
of
bringing
connie
up
such
an
awful
place
i
wonder
you
dared
to
do
it
s
done
you
see
wife
i
answered
thanks
to
percivale
who
has
nearly
torn
the
breath
out
of
me
but
now
we
must
get
you
up
and
you
will
say
that
to
see
connie
s
delight
not
to
mention
your
own
is
quite
wages
for
the
isn
t
she
afraid
to
find
herself
so
high
up
she
knows
nothing
about
it
you
do
not
mean
you
have
left
the
child
there
with
her
eyes
tied
to
be
sure
we
could
not
uncover
them
before
you
came
it
would
spoil
half
the
do
let
us
make
haste
then
it
is
surely
dangerous
to
leave
her
not
in
the
least
but
she
must
be
getting
tired
of
the
darkness
take
my
arm
don
t
you
think
walton
had
better
take
my
arm
said
percivale
and
then
you
can
put
your
hand
on
her
back
and
help
her
a
little
that
we
tried
the
plan
found
it
a
good
one
and
soon
reached
the
top
the
moment
our
eyes
fell
upon
connie
we
could
see
that
she
had
found
the
place
neither
fearful
nor
lonely
the
sweetest
ghost
of
a
smile
hovered
on
her
pale
face
which
shone
in
the
shadow
of
the
old
gateway
of
the
keep
with
light
from
within
her
own
sunny
soul
she
lay
in
such
still
expectation
that
you
would
have
thought
she
had
just
fallen
asleep
after
receiving
an
answer
to
a
prayer
reminding
me
of
a
sonnet
of
wordsworth
s
in
which
he
describes
as
the
type
of
death
the
face
of
one
sleeping
alone
within
a
mossy
cave
with
her
face
up
to
heaven
that
seemed
to
have
pleasing
remembrance
of
a
thought
foregone
a
lovely
beauty
in
a
summer
footnote
part
but
she
heard
our
steps
and
her
face
awoke
is
mamma
come
yes
my
darling
i
am
here
said
her
mother
how
do
you
feel
perfectly
well
mamma
thank
you
now
papa
one
moment
more
my
love
now
we
carried
her
to
the
spot
we
had
agreed
upon
and
while
we
held
her
a
little
inclined
that
she
might
see
the
better
her
mother
undid
the
bandage
from
her
head
hold
your
hands
over
her
eyes
a
little
way
from
them
i
said
to
her
as
she
untied
the
handkerchief
that
the
light
may
reach
them
by
degrees
and
not
blind
ethelwyn
did
so
for
a
few
moments
then
removed
them
still
for
a
moment
or
two
more
it
was
plain
from
her
look
of
utter
bewilderment
that
all
was
a
confused
mass
of
light
and
colour
then
she
gave
a
little
cry
and
to
my
astonishment
almost
fear
half
rose
to
a
sitting
posture
one
moment
more
and
she
laid
herself
gently
back
and
wept
and
sobbed
and
now
i
may
admit
my
reader
to
a
share
though
at
best
but
a
dim
reflex
in
my
poor
words
of
the
glory
that
made
her
weep
through
the
door
in
the
battlemented
wall
which
stood
on
the
very
edge
of
the
precipitous
descent
so
that
nothing
of
the
descent
was
seen
and
the
door
was
as
a
framework
to
the
picture
connie
saw
a
great
gulf
at
her
feet
full
to
the
brim
of
a
splendour
of
light
and
colour
before
her
rose
the
great
ruins
of
rock
and
castle
the
ruin
of
rock
with
castle
rough
stone
below
clear
green
happy
grass
above
even
to
the
verge
of
the
abrupt
and
awful
precipice
over
it
the
summer
sky
so
clear
that
it
must
have
been
clarified
by
sorrow
and
thought
at
the
foot
of
the
rocks
hundreds
of
feet
below
the
blue
waters
breaking
in
white
upon
the
dark
gray
sands
all
full
of
the
gladness
of
the
sun
overflowing
in
speechless
delight
and
reflected
in
fresh
gladness
from
stone
and
water
and
flower
like
new
springs
of
light
rippling
forth
from
the
earth
itself
to
swell
the
universal
tide
of
glory
all
this
seen
through
the
narrow
gothic
archway
of
a
door
in
a
wall
up
down
on
either
hand
but
the
main
marvel
was
the
look
sheer
below
into
the
abyss
full
of
light
and
air
and
colour
its
sides
lined
with
rock
and
grass
and
its
bottom
lined
with
blue
ripples
and
sand
was
it
any
wonder
that
my
connie
should
cry
aloud
when
the
vision
dawned
upon
her
and
then
weep
to
ease
a
heart
ready
to
burst
with
delight
o
lord
god
i
said
almost
involuntarily
thou
art
very
rich
thou
art
the
one
poet
the
one
maker
we
worship
thee
make
but
our
souls
as
full
of
glory
in
thy
sight
as
this
chasm
is
to
our
eyes
glorious
with
the
forms
which
thou
hast
cloven
and
carved
out
of
nothingness
and
we
shall
be
worthy
to
worship
thee
o
lord
our
for
i
was
carried
beyond
myself
with
delight
and
with
sympathy
with
connie
s
delight
and
with
the
calm
worship
of
gladness
in
my
wife
s
countenance
but
when
my
eye
fell
on
wynnie
i
saw
a
trouble
mingled
with
her
admiration
a
i
think
that
she
did
not
and
could
not
enjoy
it
more
and
when
i
turned
from
her
there
were
the
eyes
of
percivale
fixed
on
me
in
wonderment
and
for
the
moment
i
felt
as
david
must
have
felt
when
in
his
dance
of
undignified
delight
that
he
had
got
the
ark
home
again
he
saw
the
contemptuous
eyes
of
michal
fixed
on
him
from
the
window
but
i
could
not
leave
it
so
i
said
to
him
coldly
i
daresay
excuse
me
percivale
i
forgot
for
the
moment
that
i
was
not
amongst
my
own
percivale
took
his
hat
off
forgive
my
seeming
rudeness
walton
i
was
and
you
would
not
be
surprised
at
my
unconscious
behaviour
if
you
had
seen
as
much
of
the
wrong
side
of
the
stuff
as
i
have
seen
in
i
had
some
idea
of
what
he
meant
but
this
was
no
time
to
enter
upon
a
discussion
i
could
only
say
my
heart
was
full
percivale
and
i
let
it
let
me
at
least
share
in
its
overflow
he
rejoined
and
nothing
more
passed
on
the
subject
for
the
next
ten
minutes
we
stood
in
absolute
silence
we
had
set
connie
down
on
the
grass
again
but
propped
up
so
that
she
could
see
through
the
doorway
and
she
lay
in
still
ecstasy
but
there
was
more
to
be
seen
ere
we
descended
there
was
the
rest
of
the
little
islet
with
its
crop
of
on
which
the
horses
of
all
the
knights
of
king
arthur
s
round
table
might
have
fed
for
a
week
yes
for
a
fortnight
without
by
any
means
encountering
the
short
commons
of
war
there
were
the
ruins
of
the
castle
so
built
of
plates
of
the
laminated
stone
of
the
rocks
on
which
they
stood
and
so
woven
in
or
more
properly
incorporated
with
the
outstanding
rocks
themselves
that
in
some
parts
i
found
it
impossible
to
tell
which
was
building
and
which
was
rock
the
walls
themselves
seeming
like
a
growth
out
of
the
island
itself
so
perfectly
were
they
in
harmony
with
and
in
kind
the
same
as
the
natural
ground
upon
which
and
of
which
they
had
been
constructed
and
this
would
seem
to
me
to
be
the
perfection
of
architecture
the
work
of
man
s
hands
should
be
so
in
harmony
with
the
place
where
it
stands
that
it
must
look
as
if
it
had
grown
out
of
the
soil
but
the
walls
were
in
some
parts
so
thin
that
one
wondered
how
they
could
have
stood
so
long
they
must
have
been
built
before
the
time
of
any
formidable
artillery
enough
only
for
defence
from
arrows
but
then
the
island
was
nowhere
commanded
and
its
own
steep
cliffs
would
be
more
easily
defended
than
any
erections
upon
it
clearly
the
intention
was
that
no
enemy
should
thereon
find
rest
for
the
sole
of
his
foot
for
if
he
was
able
to
land
farewell
to
the
notion
of
any
further
defence
then
there
was
outside
the
walls
the
little
chapel
such
a
tiny
chapel
of
which
little
more
than
the
foundation
remained
with
the
ruins
of
the
altar
still
standing
and
outside
the
chancel
nestling
by
its
wall
a
coffin
hollowed
in
the
rock
then
the
churchyard
a
little
way
off
full
of
graves
which
i
presume
would
have
vanished
long
ago
were
it
not
that
the
very
graves
were
founded
on
the
rock
there
still
stood
old
headstones
of
thin
slate
but
no
memorials
were
left
then
there
was
the
fragment
of
arched
passage
underground
laid
open
to
the
air
in
the
centre
of
the
islet
and
last
and
grandest
of
all
the
awful
edges
of
the
rock
broken
by
time
and
carved
by
the
winds
and
the
waters
into
grotesque
shapes
and
threatening
forms
over
all
the
surface
of
the
islet
we
carried
connie
and
from
three
sides
of
this
she
looked
abroad
over
the
atlantic
s
level
it
blew
a
gentle
ethereal
breeze
on
the
top
but
had
there
been
such
a
wind
as
i
have
since
stood
against
on
that
fearful
citadel
of
nature
i
should
have
been
in
terror
lest
we
should
all
be
blown
into
the
deep
over
the
edge
she
peeped
at
the
strange
fantastic
and
round
the
corner
she
peeped
to
see
wynnie
and
her
mother
seated
in
what
they
call
arthur
s
chair
a
canopied
hollow
wrought
in
the
plated
rock
by
the
mightiest
of
all
solvents
air
and
water
till
at
length
it
was
time
that
we
should
take
our
leave
of
the
few
sheep
that
fed
over
the
place
and
issuing
by
the
gothic
door
wind
away
down
the
dangerous
path
to
the
safe
ground
below
i
think
we
had
better
tie
up
your
eyes
again
connie
i
said
why
she
asked
in
wonderment
there
s
nothing
higher
yet
is
there
no
my
love
if
there
were
you
would
hardly
be
able
for
it
i
should
think
it
is
only
to
keep
you
from
being
frightened
at
the
precipice
as
you
go
but
i
sha
n
t
be
frightened
how
do
you
know
that
because
you
are
going
to
carry
but
what
if
i
should
slip
i
might
you
i
don
t
mind
i
sha
n
t
mind
being
tumbled
over
the
precipice
if
you
do
it
i
sha
n
t
be
to
blame
and
i
m
sure
you
won
t
then
she
drew
my
head
down
and
whispered
in
my
ear
if
i
get
as
much
more
by
being
killed
as
i
have
got
by
having
my
poor
back
hurt
i
m
sure
it
will
be
well
worth
i
tried
to
smile
a
reply
for
i
could
not
speak
one
we
took
her
just
as
she
was
and
with
some
tremor
on
my
part
but
not
a
single
slip
we
bore
her
down
the
winding
path
her
face
showing
all
the
time
that
instead
of
being
afraid
she
was
in
a
state
of
ecstatic
delight
my
wife
i
could
see
was
nervous
however
and
she
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
when
we
were
once
more
at
the
foot
well
i
m
glad
that
s
over
she
said
so
am
i
i
returned
as
we
set
down
the
litter
poor
papa
i
ve
pulled
his
arms
to
pieces
and
percivale
s
too
percivale
answered
first
by
taking
up
a
huge
piece
of
stone
then
turning
towards
her
he
said
look
here
miss
connie
and
flung
it
far
out
from
the
isthmus
on
which
we
were
resting
we
heard
it
strike
on
a
rock
below
and
then
fall
in
a
shower
of
fragments
my
arms
are
all
right
you
see
he
said
meantime
wynnie
had
scrambled
down
to
the
shore
where
we
had
not
yet
been
in
a
few
minutes
we
still
lingering
she
came
running
back
to
us
out
of
breath
with
the
news
papa
percivale
there
s
such
a
grand
cave
down
there
it
goes
right
through
under
the
connie
looked
so
eager
that
percivale
and
i
glanced
at
each
other
and
without
a
word
lifted
her
and
followed
wynnie
it
was
a
little
way
that
we
had
to
carry
her
down
but
it
was
very
broken
and
insomuch
more
difficult
than
the
other
at
length
we
stood
in
the
cavern
what
a
contrast
to
the
vision
overhead
nothing
to
be
seen
but
the
cool
dark
vault
of
the
cave
long
and
winding
with
the
fresh
seaweed
lying
on
its
pebbly
floor
and
its
walls
wet
with
the
last
tide
for
every
tide
rolled
through
in
rising
and
falling
the
waters
on
the
opposite
sides
of
the
islet
greeting
through
this
cave
the
blue
shimmer
of
the
rising
sea
and
the
forms
of
huge
outlying
rocks
looking
in
at
the
further
end
where
the
roof
rose
like
a
grand
cathedral
arch
and
the
green
gleam
of
veins
rich
with
copper
dashing
and
streaking
the
darkness
in
gloomy
little
chapels
where
the
floor
of
pebbles
rose
and
rose
within
till
it
met
the
descending
roof
it
was
like
a
from
paradise
into
the
grave
but
a
cool
friendly
grave
which
even
in
its
darkest
recesses
bore
some
witness
to
the
wind
of
god
outside
in
the
occasional
ripple
of
shadowed
light
from
the
play
of
the
sun
on
the
waves
that
fleeted
and
reflected
wandered
across
its
jagged
roof
but
we
dared
not
keep
connie
long
in
the
damp
coolness
and
i
have
given
my
reader
quite
enough
of
description
for
one
hour
s
reading
he
can
scarcely
be
equal
to
more
my
invalids
had
now
beheld
the
sea
in
such
a
different
aspect
that
i
no
longer
feared
to
go
back
to
kilkhaven
thither
we
went
three
days
after
and
at
my
invitation
percivale
took
turner
s
place
in
the
carriage
chapter
xi
joe
and
his
trouble
how
bright
the
yellow
shores
of
kilkhaven
looked
after
the
dark
sands
of
tintagel
but
how
low
and
tame
its
highest
cliffs
after
the
mighty
rampart
of
rocks
which
there
face
the
sea
like
a
cordon
of
fierce
guardians
it
was
pleasant
to
settle
down
again
in
what
had
begun
to
look
like
home
and
was
indeed
made
such
by
the
boisterous
welcome
of
dora
and
the
boys
connie
s
baby
crowed
aloud
and
stretched
forth
her
chubby
arms
at
sight
of
her
the
wind
blew
gently
around
us
full
both
of
the
freshness
of
the
clean
waters
and
the
scents
of
the
to
welcome
us
back
and
the
dread
vision
of
the
shore
had
now
receded
so
far
into
the
past
that
it
was
no
longer
able
to
hurt
we
had
called
at
the
blacksmith
s
house
on
our
way
home
and
found
that
he
was
so
far
better
as
to
be
working
at
his
forge
again
his
mother
said
he
was
used
to
such
attacks
and
soon
got
over
them
i
however
feared
that
they
indicated
an
approaching
indeed
sir
she
said
joe
might
be
well
enough
if
he
liked
it
s
all
his
own
what
do
you
mean
i
asked
i
can
not
believe
that
your
son
is
in
any
way
guilty
of
his
own
he
s
a
lad
my
joe
she
answered
but
he
hasn
t
learned
what
i
had
to
learn
long
what
is
that
i
asked
to
make
up
his
mind
and
stick
to
it
to
do
one
thing
or
the
she
was
a
woman
with
a
long
upper
lip
and
a
judicial
face
and
as
she
spoke
her
lip
grew
longer
and
longer
and
when
she
closed
her
mouth
in
mark
of
her
own
resolution
that
lip
seemed
to
occupy
of
all
her
face
under
the
nose
and
what
is
it
he
won
t
do
i
don
t
mind
whether
he
does
it
or
not
if
he
would
only
make
up
his
mind
and
stick
to
what
is
it
you
want
him
to
do
then
i
don
t
want
him
to
do
it
i
m
sure
it
s
no
good
to
me
and
wouldn
t
be
much
to
him
that
i
ll
be
bound
howsomever
he
must
please
i
thought
it
not
very
wonderful
that
he
looked
gloomy
if
there
was
no
more
sunshine
for
him
at
home
than
his
mother
s
face
indicated
few
things
can
make
a
man
so
strong
and
able
for
his
work
as
a
sun
indoors
whose
rays
are
smiles
ever
ready
to
shine
upon
him
when
he
opens
the
door
the
face
of
wife
or
mother
or
sister
now
his
mother
s
face
certainly
was
not
sunny
no
doubt
it
must
have
shone
upon
him
when
he
was
a
baby
god
has
made
that
provision
for
babies
who
need
sunshine
so
much
that
a
mother
s
face
can
not
help
being
sunny
to
them
why
should
the
sunshine
depart
as
the
child
grows
older
well
i
suppose
i
must
not
ask
but
i
fear
your
son
is
very
far
from
well
such
attacks
do
not
often
occur
without
serious
mischief
somewhere
and
if
there
is
anything
troubling
him
he
is
less
likely
to
get
over
if
he
would
let
somebody
make
up
his
mind
for
him
and
then
stick
to
it
o
but
that
is
impossible
you
know
a
man
must
make
up
his
own
that
s
just
what
he
won
t
all
the
time
she
looked
naughty
only
after
a
fashion
it
was
evident
that
whatever
was
the
cause
of
it
she
was
not
in
sympathy
with
her
son
and
therefore
could
not
help
him
out
of
any
difficulty
he
might
be
in
i
made
no
further
attempt
to
learn
from
her
the
cause
of
her
son
s
discomfort
clearly
a
deeper
cause
than
his
illness
in
passing
his
workshop
we
stopped
for
a
moment
and
i
made
an
arrangement
to
meet
him
at
the
church
the
next
day
i
was
there
before
him
and
found
that
he
had
done
a
good
deal
since
we
left
little
remained
except
to
get
the
keys
put
to
rights
and
the
rods
attached
to
the
cranks
in
the
box
he
was
to
bring
a
carpenter
a
cousin
of
his
own
with
him
they
soon
arrived
and
a
small
consultation
followed
the
cousin
was
a
little
man
with
a
ready
smile
and
white
teeth
i
thought
he
might
help
me
to
understand
what
was
amiss
in
joseph
s
affairs
but
i
would
not
make
the
attempt
except
openly
i
therefore
said
half
in
a
jocular
fashion
as
with
gloomy
countenance
the
smith
was
fitting
one
loop
into
another
in
two
of
his
iron
rods
i
wish
we
could
get
this
cousin
of
yours
to
look
a
little
more
cheerful
you
would
think
he
had
quarrelled
with
the
the
carpenter
showed
his
white
teeth
between
his
rosy
lips
well
sir
if
you
ll
excuse
me
you
see
my
cousin
joe
is
not
like
the
rest
of
us
he
s
a
religious
man
is
but
i
don
t
see
how
that
should
make
him
miserable
it
hasn
t
made
me
miserable
i
hope
i
m
a
religious
man
myself
it
makes
me
happy
every
day
of
my
ah
well
returned
the
carpenter
in
a
thoughtful
tone
as
he
worked
away
gently
to
get
the
inside
out
of
the
without
hurting
it
i
don
t
say
it
s
the
religion
for
i
don
t
know
but
perhaps
it
s
the
way
he
takes
it
up
he
don
t
look
after
hisself
enough
he
s
always
thinking
about
other
people
you
see
sir
and
it
seems
to
me
sir
that
if
you
don
t
look
after
yourself
why
who
is
to
look
after
you
that
s
common
sense
it
was
a
curious
contrast
the
merry
friendly
face
which
shone
to
all
mankind
accusing
the
sombre
pale
sad
severe
even
somewhat
bitter
countenance
beside
him
of
thinking
too
much
about
other
people
and
too
little
about
himself
of
course
it
might
be
correct
in
a
way
there
is
all
the
difference
between
a
comfortable
healthy
inclination
and
a
pained
conscientious
principle
it
was
a
smile
very
unlike
his
cousin
s
with
which
joe
heard
his
remarks
on
himself
but
i
said
you
will
allow
at
least
that
if
everybody
would
take
joe
s
way
of
it
there
would
then
be
no
occasion
for
taking
care
of
i
don
t
see
why
why
because
everybody
would
take
care
of
everybody
not
so
well
i
doubt
yes
and
a
great
deal
at
any
rate
that
s
a
long
way
off
and
mean
time
to
take
care
of
the
odd
man
like
joe
there
that
don
t
look
after
hisself
why
god
of
well
there
s
just
where
i
m
out
i
don
t
know
nothing
about
that
branch
i
saw
a
grateful
light
mount
up
in
joe
s
gloomy
eyes
as
i
spoke
thus
upon
his
side
of
the
question
he
said
nothing
however
and
his
cousin
volunteering
no
further
information
i
did
not
push
any
advantage
i
might
have
gained
at
noon
i
made
them
leave
their
work
and
come
home
with
me
to
have
their
dinner
they
hoped
to
finish
the
job
before
dusk
harry
cobb
and
i
dropped
behind
and
joe
harper
walked
on
in
front
apparently
sunk
in
meditation
scarcely
were
we
out
of
the
churchyard
and
on
the
road
leading
to
the
rectory
when
i
saw
the
sexton
s
daughter
meeting
us
she
had
almost
come
up
to
joe
before
he
saw
her
for
his
gaze
was
bent
on
the
ground
and
he
started
they
shook
hands
in
what
seemed
to
me
an
odd
constrained
yet
familiar
fashion
and
then
stood
as
if
they
wanted
to
talk
but
without
speaking
harry
and
i
passed
both
with
a
nod
of
recognition
to
the
young
woman
but
neither
of
us
had
the
to
look
behind
i
glanced
at
harry
and
he
answered
me
with
a
queer
look
when
we
reached
the
turning
that
would
hide
them
from
our
view
i
looked
back
almost
involuntarily
and
there
they
were
still
standing
but
before
we
reached
the
door
of
the
rectory
joe
got
up
with
us
there
was
something
remarkable
in
the
appearance
of
agnes
coombes
the
sexton
s
daughter
she
was
about
i
should
imagine
the
youngest
of
the
family
with
a
sallow
rather
sickly
complexion
somewhat
sorrowful
eyes
a
smile
rare
and
sweet
a
fine
figure
tall
and
slender
and
a
graceful
gait
i
now
saw
i
thought
a
good
hair
further
into
the
smith
s
affairs
beyond
the
hair
however
all
was
dark
but
i
saw
likewise
that
the
well
of
truth
whence
i
might
draw
the
whole
business
must
be
the
girl
s
mother
after
the
men
had
had
their
dinner
and
rested
a
while
they
went
back
to
the
church
and
i
went
to
the
sexton
s
cottage
i
found
the
old
man
seated
at
the
window
with
his
pot
of
beer
on
the
sill
and
an
empty
plate
beside
it
come
in
sir
he
said
rising
as
i
put
my
head
in
at
the
door
the
mis
ess
ben
t
in
but
she
ll
be
here
in
a
few
o
it
s
of
no
consequence
i
said
are
they
all
well
all
comfortable
sir
it
be
fine
dry
weather
for
them
this
sir
it
be
in
winter
it
be
worst
for
but
it
s
a
snug
enough
shelter
you
ve
got
here
it
seems
such
anyhow
though
to
be
sure
it
is
the
blasts
of
winter
that
find
out
the
weak
places
both
in
house
and
it
ben
t
the
wind
touch
he
said
they
be
safe
enough
from
the
wind
it
be
the
wet
sir
there
ben
t
much
snow
in
these
parts
but
when
it
du
come
that
be
very
bad
for
them
poor
things
could
it
be
that
he
was
harping
on
the
old
theme
again
but
at
least
this
cottage
keeps
out
the
wet
i
said
if
not
we
must
have
it
seen
this
cottage
du
well
enough
sir
it
ll
last
my
time
then
why
are
you
pitying
your
family
for
having
to
live
in
it
bless
your
heart
sir
it
s
not
them
they
du
well
enough
it
s
my
people
out
yonder
you
ve
got
the
souls
to
look
after
and
i
ve
got
the
bodies
that
s
what
it
be
sir
to
be
sure
the
last
exclamation
was
uttered
in
a
tone
of
impatient
surprise
at
my
stupidity
in
giving
all
my
thoughts
and
sympathies
to
the
living
and
none
to
the
dead
i
pursued
the
subject
no
further
but
as
i
lay
in
bed
that
night
it
began
to
dawn
upon
me
as
a
lovable
kind
of
hallucination
in
which
the
man
indulged
he
too
had
an
office
in
the
church
of
god
and
he
would
magnify
that
office
he
could
not
bear
that
there
should
be
no
further
outcome
of
his
labour
that
the
burying
of
the
dead
out
of
sight
should
be
the
and
the
he
was
god
s
vicar
the
gardener
in
god
s
acre
as
the
germans
call
the
churchyard
when
all
others
had
forsaken
the
dead
he
remained
their
friend
caring
for
what
little
comfort
yet
remained
possible
to
them
hence
in
all
changes
of
air
and
sky
above
he
attributed
to
them
some
knowledge
of
the
same
and
some
share
in
their
consequences
even
down
in
the
darkness
of
the
tomb
it
was
his
way
of
keeping
up
the
relation
between
the
living
and
the
dead
finding
i
made
him
no
reply
he
took
up
the
word
again
you
ve
got
your
part
sir
and
i
ve
got
mine
you
up
into
the
pulpit
and
i
down
into
the
grave
but
it
ll
be
all
the
same
by
and
i
hope
it
will
i
answered
but
when
you
do
go
down
into
your
own
grave
you
ll
know
a
good
deal
less
about
it
than
you
do
now
you
ll
find
you
ve
got
other
things
to
think
about
but
here
comes
your
wife
she
ll
talk
about
the
living
rather
than
the
that
s
natural
sir
she
brought
em
to
life
and
i
buried
em
at
least
best
part
of
em
if
only
i
had
the
other
two
safe
down
with
the
rest
i
remembered
what
the
old
woman
had
told
me
that
she
had
two
boys
the
sea
and
i
knew
therefore
what
he
meant
he
regarded
his
drowned
boys
as
still
tossed
about
in
the
weary
wet
cold
ocean
and
would
have
gladly
laid
them
to
rest
in
the
warm
dry
churchyard
he
wiped
a
tear
from
the
corner
of
his
eye
with
the
back
of
his
hand
and
saying
well
i
must
be
off
to
my
gardening
left
me
with
his
wife
i
saw
then
that
humorist
as
the
old
man
might
be
his
humour
like
that
of
all
true
humorists
lay
close
about
the
wells
of
weeping
the
old
man
seems
a
little
out
of
sorts
i
said
to
his
wife
well
sir
she
answered
with
her
usual
gentleness
a
gentleness
which
obedient
suffering
had
perfected
this
be
the
day
he
buried
our
nancy
this
day
two
years
and
agnes
be
come
home
from
her
work
poorly
and
the
two
things
together
they
ve
upset
him
a
i
met
agnes
coming
this
way
where
is
she
i
believe
she
be
in
the
churchyard
sir
i
ve
been
to
the
doctor
about
i
hope
it
s
nothing
i
hope
not
sir
but
you
see
four
on
em
sir
well
she
s
in
god
s
hands
you
that
she
be
i
want
to
ask
you
about
something
what
be
that
sir
if
i
can
tell
i
will
you
may
be
sure
i
want
to
know
what
s
the
matter
with
joe
harper
the
they
du
say
it
be
a
consumption
but
what
has
he
got
on
his
mind
he
s
got
nothing
on
his
mind
sir
he
be
as
good
a
by
as
ever
stepped
i
assure
you
but
i
am
sure
there
is
something
or
other
on
his
mind
he
s
not
so
happy
as
he
should
be
he
s
not
the
man
it
seems
to
me
to
be
unhappy
because
he
s
a
man
like
him
would
not
be
miserable
because
he
was
going
to
die
it
might
make
him
look
sad
sometimes
but
not
gloomy
as
he
well
sir
i
believe
you
be
right
and
perhaps
i
know
summat
but
it
s
part
i
believe
my
agnes
and
joe
harper
are
as
fond
upon
one
another
as
any
two
in
the
are
they
not
going
to
be
married
then
there
be
the
pint
sir
i
don
t
believe
joe
ever
said
a
word
o
the
sort
to
aggy
she
never
could
ha
kep
it
from
me
why
doesn
t
he
then
that
s
the
pint
again
sir
all
as
knows
him
says
it
s
because
he
be
in
such
bad
health
and
he
thinks
he
oughtn
t
to
go
marrying
with
one
foot
in
the
grave
he
never
said
so
to
me
but
i
think
very
likely
that
be
for
that
matter
coombes
we
ve
all
got
one
foot
in
the
grave
i
that
be
very
true
and
what
does
your
daughter
think
i
believe
she
thinks
the
same
and
so
they
go
on
talking
to
each
other
like
old
married
folks
not
like
lovers
at
all
sir
but
i
can
t
help
fancying
it
have
something
to
do
with
my
aggy
s
pale
and
something
to
do
with
joe
s
pale
face
too
coombes
i
said
thank
you
you
ve
told
me
more
than
i
expected
it
explains
everything
i
must
have
it
out
with
joe
o
deary
me
sir
don
t
go
and
tell
him
i
said
anything
as
if
i
wanted
him
to
marry
my
don
t
you
be
afraid
i
ll
take
good
care
of
that
and
don
t
fancy
i
m
fond
of
meddling
with
other
people
s
affairs
but
this
is
a
case
in
which
i
ought
to
do
something
joe
s
a
fine
that
he
be
sir
i
couldn
t
wish
a
better
for
a
i
put
on
my
hat
you
won
t
get
me
into
no
trouble
with
joe
will
ye
sir
indeed
i
will
not
coombes
i
should
be
doing
a
great
deal
more
harm
than
good
if
i
said
a
word
to
make
him
doubt
i
went
straight
to
the
church
there
were
the
two
men
working
away
in
the
shadowy
tower
and
there
was
agnes
standing
beside
knitting
like
her
mother
so
quiet
so
solemn
even
that
it
did
indeed
look
as
if
she
were
a
wife
hovering
about
her
husband
at
his
work
harry
was
saying
something
to
her
as
i
went
in
but
when
they
saw
me
they
were
silent
and
agnes
gently
withdrew
do
you
think
you
will
get
through
i
asked
sure
of
it
sir
answered
harry
you
shouldn
t
be
sure
of
anything
harry
we
are
told
in
the
new
testament
that
we
ought
to
say
the
lord
said
joe
now
joe
you
re
too
hard
upon
harry
i
said
you
don
t
think
that
the
bible
means
to
pull
a
man
up
every
step
like
that
till
he
s
afraid
to
speak
a
word
it
was
about
a
long
journey
and
a
year
s
residence
that
the
apostle
james
was
no
doubt
sir
but
the
principle
s
the
same
harry
can
no
more
be
sure
of
finishing
his
work
before
it
be
dark
than
those
people
could
be
of
going
their
long
that
is
perfectly
true
but
you
are
taking
the
letter
for
the
spirit
and
that
i
suspect
in
more
ways
than
one
the
religion
does
not
lie
in
not
being
sure
about
anything
but
in
a
loving
desire
that
the
will
of
god
in
the
matter
whatever
it
be
may
be
done
and
if
harry
has
not
learned
yet
to
care
about
the
will
of
god
what
is
the
good
of
coming
down
upon
him
that
way
as
if
that
would
teach
him
in
the
least
when
he
loves
god
then
and
not
till
then
will
he
care
about
his
will
nor
does
the
religion
lie
in
saying
the
lord
every
time
anything
is
to
be
done
it
is
a
most
dangerous
thing
to
use
sacred
words
often
it
makes
them
so
common
to
our
ear
that
at
length
when
used
most
solemnly
they
have
not
half
the
effect
they
ought
to
have
and
that
is
a
serious
loss
what
the
apostle
means
is
that
we
should
always
be
in
the
mood
of
looking
up
to
god
and
having
regard
to
his
will
not
always
writing
for
instance
as
so
many
do
most
irreverently
i
think
using
a
latin
contraction
for
the
beautiful
words
just
as
if
they
were
a
charm
or
as
if
god
would
take
offence
if
they
did
not
make
the
salvo
of
acknowledgment
it
seems
to
me
quite
heathenish
our
hearts
ought
ever
to
be
in
the
spirit
of
those
words
our
lips
ought
to
utter
them
rarely
besides
there
are
some
things
a
man
might
be
pretty
sure
the
lord
it
sounds
fine
sir
but
i
m
not
sure
that
i
understand
what
you
mean
to
say
it
sounds
to
me
like
a
darkening
of
i
saw
that
i
had
irritated
him
and
so
had
in
some
measure
lost
ground
but
harry
struck
in
how
you
say
that
now
joe
know
what
the
parson
means
well
enough
and
everybody
knows
i
ain
t
got
half
the
brains
you
ve
the
reason
is
harry
that
he
s
got
something
in
his
head
that
stands
in
the
and
there
s
nothing
in
my
head
stand
in
the
way
returned
harry
laughing
this
made
me
laugh
too
and
even
joe
could
not
help
a
sympathetic
grin
by
this
time
it
was
getting
dark
i
m
afraid
harry
after
all
you
won
t
get
through
i
begin
to
think
so
too
sir
and
there
s
joe
saying
i
told
you
so
over
and
over
to
himself
though
he
won
t
say
it
out
like
a
joe
answered
only
with
another
grin
i
tell
you
what
it
is
harry
i
said
you
must
come
again
on
monday
and
on
your
way
home
just
look
in
and
tell
joe
s
mother
that
i
have
kept
him
over
the
change
will
do
him
no
sir
that
can
t
he
i
haven
t
got
a
clean
you
can
have
a
shirt
of
mine
i
said
but
i
m
afraid
you
ll
want
your
sunday
i
ll
bring
them
for
you
joe
before
you
re
up
interposed
harry
and
then
you
can
go
to
church
with
aggy
coombes
you
here
was
just
what
i
wanted
hold
your
tongue
harry
said
joe
angrily
you
re
talking
of
what
you
don
t
know
anything
well
joe
i
ben
t
a
fool
if
i
ben
t
so
religious
as
you
be
you
ben
t
a
bad
fellow
though
you
be
a
methodist
and
i
ben
t
a
fool
though
i
be
harry
what
do
you
mean
harry
do
hold
your
well
i
ll
tell
you
what
i
mean
first
and
then
i
ll
hold
my
tongue
i
mean
this
that
nobody
with
two
eyes
or
one
eye
for
that
matter
in
his
head
could
help
seeing
the
eyes
you
and
aggy
make
at
each
other
and
why
you
don
t
port
your
helm
and
board
her
i
won
t
say
it
s
more
than
i
know
but
i
du
say
it
to
be
more
than
i
think
be
fair
to
the
young
hold
your
tongue
i
said
i
would
when
i
d
answered
you
as
to
what
i
meaned
so
no
more
at
present
but
i
ll
be
over
with
your
clothes
afore
you
re
up
in
the
as
harry
spoke
he
was
busy
gathering
his
tools
they
won
t
be
in
the
way
will
they
sir
he
said
as
he
heaped
them
together
in
the
furthest
corner
of
the
tower
not
in
the
least
i
returned
if
i
had
my
way
all
the
tools
used
in
building
the
church
should
be
carved
on
the
posts
and
pillars
of
it
to
indicate
the
sacredness
of
labour
and
the
worship
of
god
that
lies
not
in
building
the
church
merely
but
in
every
honest
trade
honestly
pursued
for
the
good
of
mankind
and
the
need
of
the
workman
for
a
necessity
of
god
is
laid
upon
every
workman
as
well
as
on
paul
only
paul
saw
it
and
every
workman
doesn
t
thank
you
sir
i
like
that
way
of
it
i
almost
think
i
could
be
a
little
bit
religious
after
your
way
of
it
almost
harry
growled
joe
not
unkindly
now
you
hold
your
tongue
joe
i
said
leave
harry
to
me
you
may
take
him
if
you
like
after
i
ve
done
with
laughing
merrily
but
making
no
other
reply
than
a
hearty
harry
strode
away
out
of
the
church
and
joe
and
i
went
home
together
when
he
had
had
his
tea
i
asked
him
to
go
out
with
me
for
a
walk
the
sun
was
shining
aslant
upon
the
downs
from
over
the
sea
we
rose
out
of
the
shadowy
hollow
to
the
sunlit
brow
i
was
a
little
in
advance
of
joe
happening
to
turn
i
saw
the
light
full
on
his
head
and
face
while
the
rest
of
his
body
had
not
yet
emerged
from
the
shadow
stop
joe
i
said
i
want
to
see
you
so
for
a
he
stood
a
little
surprised
you
look
just
like
a
man
rising
from
the
dead
joe
i
said
i
don
t
know
what
you
mean
sir
he
returned
i
will
describe
yourself
to
you
your
head
and
face
are
full
of
sunlight
the
rest
of
your
body
is
still
buried
in
the
shadow
look
i
will
stand
where
you
are
now
and
you
come
here
you
will
soon
see
what
i
we
changed
places
joe
stared
for
a
moment
then
his
face
brightened
i
see
what
you
mean
sir
he
said
i
fancy
you
don
t
mean
the
resurrection
of
the
body
but
the
resurrection
of
i
do
joe
did
it
ever
strike
you
that
the
whole
history
of
the
christian
life
is
a
series
of
such
resurrections
every
time
a
man
bethinks
himself
that
he
is
not
walking
in
the
light
that
he
has
been
forgetting
himself
and
must
repent
that
he
has
been
asleep
and
must
awake
that
he
has
been
letting
his
garments
trail
and
must
gird
up
the
loins
of
his
mind
every
time
this
takes
place
there
is
a
resurrection
in
the
world
yes
joe
and
every
time
that
a
man
finds
that
his
heart
is
troubled
that
he
is
not
rejoicing
in
god
a
resurrection
must
follow
a
resurrection
out
of
the
night
of
troubled
thoughts
into
the
gladness
of
the
truth
for
the
truth
is
and
ever
was
and
ever
must
be
gladness
however
much
the
souls
on
which
it
shines
may
be
obscured
by
the
clouds
of
sorrow
troubled
by
the
thunders
of
fear
or
shot
through
with
the
lightnings
of
pain
now
joe
will
you
let
me
tell
you
what
you
are
like
i
do
not
know
your
thoughts
i
am
only
judging
from
your
words
and
looks
you
may
if
you
like
sir
answered
joe
a
little
sulkily
but
i
was
not
to
be
repelled
i
stood
up
in
the
sunlight
so
that
my
eyes
caught
only
about
half
the
sun
s
disc
then
i
bent
my
face
towards
the
earth
what
part
of
me
is
the
light
shining
on
now
joe
just
the
top
of
your
head
answered
he
there
then
i
returned
that
is
just
what
you
are
like
a
man
with
the
light
on
his
head
but
not
on
his
face
and
why
not
on
your
face
because
you
hold
your
head
isn
t
it
possible
sir
that
a
man
might
lose
the
light
on
his
face
as
you
put
it
by
doing
his
duty
that
is
a
difficult
question
i
replied
i
must
think
before
i
answer
i
mean
added
joe
mightn
t
his
duty
be
a
painful
one
yes
but
i
think
that
would
rather
etherealise
than
destroy
the
light
behind
the
sorrow
would
spring
a
yet
greater
light
from
the
very
duty
itself
i
have
expressed
myself
badly
but
you
will
see
what
i
to
be
frank
with
you
joe
i
do
not
see
that
light
in
your
face
therefore
i
think
something
must
be
wrong
with
you
remember
a
good
man
is
not
necessarily
in
the
right
peter
was
a
good
man
yet
our
lord
called
him
satan
and
meant
it
of
course
for
he
never
said
what
he
did
not
how
can
i
be
wrong
when
all
my
trouble
comes
from
doing
my
duty
nothing
else
as
far
as
i
know
then
i
replied
a
sudden
light
breaking
in
on
my
mind
i
doubt
whether
what
you
suppose
to
be
your
duty
can
be
your
duty
if
it
were
i
do
not
think
it
would
make
you
so
miserable
at
least
i
may
be
wrong
but
i
venture
to
think
what
is
a
man
to
go
by
then
if
he
thinks
a
thing
is
his
duty
is
he
not
to
do
it
most
assuredly
until
he
knows
better
but
it
is
of
the
greatest
consequence
whether
the
supposed
duty
be
the
will
of
god
or
the
invention
of
one
s
own
fancy
or
mistaken
judgment
a
real
duty
is
always
something
right
in
itself
the
duty
a
man
makes
his
for
the
time
by
supposing
it
to
be
a
duty
may
be
something
quite
wrong
in
itself
the
duty
of
a
hindoo
widow
is
to
burn
herself
on
the
body
of
her
husband
but
that
duty
lasts
no
longer
than
till
she
sees
that
not
being
the
will
of
god
it
is
not
her
duty
a
real
duty
on
the
other
hand
is
a
necessity
of
the
human
nature
without
seeing
and
doing
which
a
man
can
never
attain
to
the
truth
and
blessedness
of
his
own
being
it
was
the
duty
of
the
early
hermits
to
encourage
the
growth
of
vermin
upon
their
bodies
for
they
supposed
that
was
pleasing
to
god
but
they
could
not
fare
so
well
as
if
they
had
seen
the
truth
that
the
will
of
god
was
cleanliness
and
there
may
be
far
more
serious
things
done
by
christian
people
against
the
will
of
god
in
the
fancy
of
doing
their
duty
than
such
a
trifle
as
swarming
with
worms
in
a
word
thinking
a
thing
is
your
duty
makes
it
your
duty
only
till
you
know
better
and
the
prime
duty
of
every
man
is
to
seek
and
find
that
he
may
do
the
will
of
but
do
you
think
sir
that
a
man
is
likely
to
be
doing
what
he
ought
not
if
he
is
doing
what
he
don
t
like
not
so
likely
i
allow
but
there
may
be
ambition
in
it
a
man
must
not
want
to
be
better
than
the
right
that
is
the
delusion
of
the
anchorite
a
delusion
in
which
the
man
forgets
the
rights
of
others
for
the
sake
of
his
own
it
might
be
for
the
sake
of
another
person
and
not
for
the
person
s
own
sake
at
it
might
be
but
except
it
were
the
will
of
god
for
that
other
person
it
would
be
doing
him
or
her
a
real
we
were
coming
gradually
towards
what
i
wanted
to
make
the
point
in
question
i
wished
him
to
tell
me
all
about
it
himself
however
for
i
knew
that
while
advice
given
on
request
is
generally
disregarded
to
offer
advice
unasked
is
worthy
only
of
a
fool
but
how
are
you
to
know
the
will
of
god
in
every
case
asked
joe
by
looking
at
the
general
laws
of
life
and
obeying
them
except
there
be
anything
special
in
a
particular
case
to
bring
it
under
a
higher
ah
but
that
be
just
what
there
is
well
my
dear
fellow
that
may
be
but
the
special
conduct
may
not
be
right
for
the
special
case
for
all
that
the
speciality
of
the
case
may
not
be
even
sufficient
to
take
it
from
under
the
ordinary
rule
but
it
is
of
no
use
talking
generals
let
us
come
to
particulars
if
you
can
trust
me
tell
me
all
about
it
and
we
may
be
able
to
let
some
light
in
i
am
sure
there
is
darkness
i
will
turn
it
over
in
my
mind
sir
and
if
i
can
bring
myself
to
talk
about
it
i
will
i
would
rather
tell
you
than
anyone
i
said
no
more
we
watched
a
glorious
sunset
there
never
was
a
grander
place
for
sunsets
and
went
home
chapter
xii
a
small
adventure
the
next
morning
harry
came
with
the
clothes
but
joe
did
not
go
to
church
neither
did
agnes
make
her
appearance
that
morning
they
were
both
present
at
the
evening
service
however
when
we
came
out
of
church
it
was
cloudy
and
dark
and
the
wind
was
blowing
cold
from
the
sea
the
sky
was
covered
with
one
cloud
but
the
waves
tossing
themselves
against
the
rocks
flashed
whiteness
out
of
the
general
gloom
as
the
tide
rose
the
wind
increased
it
was
a
night
of
surly
temper
hard
and
gloomy
not
a
star
cracked
the
blue
above
there
was
no
blue
and
the
wind
was
i
once
heard
that
word
in
scotland
and
never
forgot
it
after
one
of
our
usual
gatherings
in
connie
s
room
which
were
much
shorter
here
because
of
the
evening
service
in
summer
i
withdrew
till
supper
should
be
ready
now
i
have
always
had
as
i
think
i
have
incidentally
stated
before
a
certain
peculiar
pleasure
in
the
surly
aspects
of
nature
when
i
was
a
young
man
this
took
form
in
opposition
and
defiance
since
i
had
begun
to
grow
old
the
form
had
changed
into
a
sense
of
safety
i
welcomed
such
aspects
partly
at
least
because
they
roused
my
faith
to
look
through
and
beyond
the
small
region
of
human
conditions
in
which
alone
the
storm
can
be
and
blow
and
thus
induced
a
feeling
like
that
of
the
child
who
lies
in
his
warm
crib
and
listens
to
the
howling
of
one
of
these
same
storms
outside
the
house
which
yet
trembles
at
its
fiercer
onsets
the
house
is
not
in
danger
or
if
it
be
that
is
his
father
s
business
not
his
hence
it
came
that
after
supper
i
put
on
my
and
and
went
out
into
the
night
speaking
of
it
in
its
human
symbolism
i
meant
to
have
a
stroll
down
to
the
breakwater
of
which
i
have
yet
said
little
but
which
was
a
favourite
resort
both
of
myself
and
my
children
at
the
further
end
of
it
always
covered
at
high
water
was
an
outlying
cluster
of
low
rocks
in
the
heart
of
which
the
lord
of
the
manor
a
christian
gentleman
of
the
old
school
had
constructed
a
bath
of
graduated
depth
an
the
only
really
safe
place
for
men
who
were
swimmers
to
bathe
in
thither
i
was
in
the
habit
of
taking
my
two
little
men
every
morning
and
bathing
with
them
that
i
might
develop
the
fish
that
was
in
them
for
as
george
herbert
says
man
is
everything
and
more
he
is
a
tree
yet
bears
no
fruit
a
beast
yet
is
or
should
be
more
and
he
might
have
gone
on
to
say
that
he
is
or
should
be
a
fish
as
well
it
will
seem
strange
to
any
reader
who
can
recall
the
position
of
my
connie
s
room
that
the
nearest
way
to
the
breakwater
should
be
through
that
room
but
so
it
was
i
mention
the
fact
because
i
want
my
readers
to
understand
a
certain
peculiarity
of
the
room
by
the
side
of
the
window
which
looked
out
upon
the
breakwater
was
a
narrow
door
apparently
of
a
closet
or
cupboard
which
communicated
however
with
a
narrow
curving
passage
leading
into
a
little
wooden
hut
the
walls
of
which
were
by
no
means
impervious
to
the
wind
for
they
were
formed
of
with
the
bark
still
upon
them
from
this
hut
one
or
two
little
windows
looked
seaward
and
a
door
led
out
on
the
bit
of
sward
in
which
lay
the
under
connie
s
window
from
this
spot
again
a
door
in
the
low
wall
and
thick
hedge
led
out
on
the
downs
where
a
path
wound
along
the
cliffs
that
formed
the
side
of
the
bay
till
descending
under
the
it
brought
you
to
the
root
of
the
breakwater
this
mole
stretched
its
long
strong
low
back
to
a
rock
a
good
way
out
breaking
the
force
of
the
waves
and
rendering
the
channel
of
a
small
river
that
here
flowed
into
the
sea
across
the
sands
from
the
mouth
of
the
canal
a
refuge
from
the
atlantic
but
it
was
a
roadway
often
hard
to
reach
in
fair
weather
even
the
wind
falling
as
the
vessel
rounded
the
point
of
the
breakwater
into
the
calm
of
the
projecting
headlands
the
would
sometimes
dash
her
helpless
on
the
rocks
during
all
this
heavenly
summer
there
had
been
no
thought
or
fear
of
any
such
disaster
the
present
night
was
a
hint
of
what
weather
would
yet
come
when
i
went
into
connie
s
room
i
found
her
lying
in
bed
a
very
picture
of
peace
but
my
entrance
destroyed
the
picture
papa
she
said
why
have
you
got
your
coat
on
surely
you
are
not
going
out
the
wind
is
blowing
not
very
dreadfully
connie
it
blew
much
worse
the
night
we
found
your
but
it
is
very
i
allow
that
but
there
is
a
glimmer
from
the
sea
i
am
only
going
on
the
breakwater
for
a
few
minutes
you
know
i
like
a
stormy
night
quite
as
much
as
a
fine
i
shall
be
miserable
till
you
come
home
nonsense
connie
you
don
t
think
your
father
hasn
t
sense
to
take
care
of
himself
or
rather
connie
for
i
grant
that
is
poor
ground
of
comfort
you
don
t
think
i
can
go
anywhere
without
my
father
to
take
care
of
me
but
there
is
no
occasion
is
there
papa
do
you
think
i
should
be
better
pleased
with
my
boys
if
they
shrunk
from
everything
involving
the
least
possibility
of
danger
because
there
was
no
occasion
for
it
that
is
just
the
way
to
make
cowards
and
i
am
certain
god
would
not
like
his
children
to
indulge
in
such
moods
of
as
that
he
might
well
be
ashamed
of
them
the
fearful
are
far
more
likely
to
meet
with
accidents
than
the
courageous
but
really
connie
i
am
almost
ashamed
of
talking
so
it
is
all
your
fault
there
is
positively
no
ground
for
apprehension
and
i
hope
you
won
t
spoil
my
walk
by
the
thought
that
my
foolish
little
girl
is
i
will
be
good
indeed
i
will
papa
she
said
holding
up
her
mouth
to
kiss
me
i
left
her
room
and
went
through
the
wooden
passage
into
the
bark
hut
the
wind
roared
about
it
shook
it
and
pawed
it
and
sung
and
whistled
in
the
chinks
of
the
planks
i
went
out
and
shut
the
door
that
moment
the
wind
seized
upon
me
and
i
had
to
fight
with
it
when
i
got
on
the
path
leading
along
the
edge
of
the
downs
i
felt
something
lighter
than
any
feather
fly
in
my
face
when
i
put
up
my
hand
i
found
my
cheek
wet
again
and
again
i
was
thus
assailed
but
when
i
got
to
the
breakwater
i
found
what
it
was
they
were
flakes
of
foam
bubbles
worked
up
into
little
masses
of
adhering
thousands
which
the
wind
blew
off
the
waters
and
across
the
downs
carrying
some
of
them
miles
inland
when
i
reached
the
breakwater
and
looked
along
its
ridge
through
the
darkness
of
the
night
i
was
bewildered
to
see
a
whiteness
lying
here
and
there
in
a
great
patch
upon
its
top
they
were
but
accumulations
of
these
like
lying
so
thick
that
i
expected
to
have
to
wade
through
them
only
they
vanished
at
the
touch
of
my
feet
till
then
i
had
almost
believed
it
was
snow
i
saw
on
the
edge
of
the
waves
in
quieter
spots
they
lay
like
yeast
foaming
and
working
now
and
then
a
little
rush
of
water
from
a
higher
wave
swept
over
the
top
of
the
broad
breakwater
as
with
head
bowed
sideways
against
the
wind
i
struggled
along
towards
the
rock
at
its
end
but
i
said
to
myself
the
tide
is
falling
fast
and
salt
water
hurts
nobody
and
struggled
on
over
the
huge
rough
stones
of
the
mighty
heap
outside
which
the
waves
were
white
with
wrath
inside
which
they
had
fallen
asleep
only
heaving
with
the
memory
of
their
late
unrest
i
reached
the
tall
rock
at
length
climbed
the
rude
stair
leading
up
to
the
flagstaff
and
looked
abroad
if
looking
it
could
be
called
into
the
thick
dark
but
the
wind
blew
so
strong
on
the
top
that
i
was
glad
to
descend
between
me
and
the
basin
where
yesterday
morning
i
had
bathed
in
still
water
and
sunshine
with
my
boys
rolled
the
deathly
waves
i
wandered
on
the
rough
narrow
space
yet
uncovered
stumbling
over
the
stones
and
the
rocky
points
between
which
they
lay
stood
here
and
there
and
at
length
finding
a
sheltered
nook
in
a
mass
of
rock
sat
with
the
wind
howling
and
the
waves
bursting
around
me
there
i
fell
into
a
sort
of
brown
study
almost
a
but
i
had
not
sat
long
before
i
came
broad
awake
for
i
heard
voices
low
and
earnest
one
i
recognised
as
joe
s
voice
the
other
was
a
woman
s
i
could
not
tell
what
they
said
for
some
time
and
therefore
felt
no
immediate
necessity
for
disclosing
my
proximity
but
sat
debating
with
myself
whether
i
should
speak
to
them
or
not
at
length
in
a
lull
of
the
wind
i
heard
the
woman
say
i
could
fancy
with
a
sigh
i
m
sure
you
ll
du
what
is
right
joe
don
t
e
think
o
me
it
s
just
of
you
that
i
du
think
aggy
you
know
it
ben
t
for
my
sake
surely
you
know
that
there
was
no
answer
for
a
moment
i
was
still
doubting
what
i
had
best
do
go
away
quietly
or
let
them
know
i
was
there
when
she
spoke
again
there
was
a
momentary
lull
now
in
the
noises
of
both
wind
and
water
and
i
heard
what
she
said
well
enough
it
ben
t
for
me
to
contradict
you
joe
but
i
don
t
think
you
be
going
to
die
you
be
no
worse
than
last
year
be
you
now
joe
it
flashed
across
me
how
once
before
a
stormy
night
and
darkness
had
brought
me
close
to
a
soul
in
agony
then
i
was
in
agony
myself
now
the
world
was
all
fair
and
hopeful
around
me
the
portals
of
the
world
beyond
ever
opening
wider
as
i
approached
them
and
letting
out
more
of
their
glory
to
gladden
the
path
to
their
threshold
but
here
were
two
souls
straying
in
a
mist
which
faith
might
roll
away
and
leave
them
walking
in
the
light
the
moment
was
come
i
must
speak
joe
i
called
out
who
s
there
he
cried
and
i
heard
him
start
to
his
feet
only
walton
where
are
you
we
can
t
be
very
far
off
he
answered
not
in
a
tone
of
any
pleasure
at
finding
me
so
nigh
i
rose
and
peering
about
through
the
darkness
found
that
they
were
a
little
higher
up
on
the
same
rock
by
which
i
was
sheltered
you
mustn
t
think
i
said
that
i
have
been
eavesdropping
i
had
no
idea
anyone
was
near
me
till
i
heard
your
voices
and
i
did
not
hear
a
word
till
just
the
last
sentence
or
i
saw
someone
go
up
the
said
joe
but
i
thought
he
was
gone
away
again
it
will
be
a
lesson
to
i
m
no
joe
i
returned
as
i
scrambled
up
the
rock
you
will
have
no
cause
to
regret
that
i
happened
to
overhear
a
little
i
am
sure
joe
you
will
never
say
anything
you
need
be
ashamed
of
but
what
i
heard
was
sufficient
to
let
me
into
the
secret
of
your
trouble
will
you
let
me
talk
to
joe
agnes
i
ve
been
young
myself
and
to
tell
the
truth
i
don
t
think
i
m
old
i
am
sure
sir
she
answered
you
won
t
be
hard
on
joe
and
me
i
don
t
suppose
there
be
anything
wrong
in
liking
each
other
though
we
can
t
be
she
spoke
in
a
low
tone
and
her
voice
trembled
very
much
yet
there
was
a
certain
womanly
composure
in
her
utterance
i
m
sure
it
s
very
bold
of
me
to
talk
so
she
added
but
joe
will
tell
you
all
about
i
was
close
beside
them
now
and
fancied
i
saw
through
the
dusk
the
motion
of
her
hand
stealing
into
his
well
joe
this
is
just
what
i
wanted
i
said
a
woman
can
be
braver
than
a
big
smith
sometimes
agnes
has
done
her
part
now
you
do
yours
and
tell
me
all
about
no
response
followed
my
adjuration
i
must
help
him
i
think
i
know
how
the
matter
lies
joe
you
think
you
are
not
going
to
live
long
and
that
therefore
you
ought
not
to
marry
am
i
right
not
far
off
it
sir
he
answered
now
joe
i
said
can
t
we
talk
as
friends
about
this
matter
i
have
no
right
to
intrude
into
your
affairs
none
in
the
least
except
what
friendship
gives
me
if
you
say
i
am
not
to
talk
about
it
i
shall
be
silent
to
force
advice
upon
you
would
be
as
impertinent
as
it
s
all
the
same
i
m
afraid
sir
my
mind
has
been
made
up
for
a
long
time
what
right
have
i
to
bring
other
people
into
trouble
but
i
take
it
kind
of
you
sir
though
i
mayn
t
look
agnes
wants
to
hear
your
way
of
it
i
m
this
was
not
very
encouraging
still
i
thought
it
sufficient
ground
for
proceeding
i
suppose
you
will
allow
that
the
root
of
all
christian
behaviour
is
the
will
of
god
surely
is
it
not
the
will
of
god
then
that
when
a
man
and
woman
love
each
other
they
should
marry
certainly
sir
where
there
be
no
reasons
against
of
course
and
you
judge
you
see
reason
for
not
doing
so
else
you
would
i
do
see
that
a
man
should
not
bring
a
woman
into
trouble
for
the
sake
of
being
comfortable
himself
for
the
rest
of
a
few
weary
agnes
was
sobbing
gently
behind
her
handkerchief
i
knew
how
gladly
she
would
be
joe
s
wife
if
only
to
nurse
him
through
his
last
illness
not
except
it
would
make
her
comfortable
too
i
grant
you
joe
but
listen
to
me
in
the
first
place
you
don
t
know
and
you
are
not
required
to
know
when
you
are
going
to
die
in
fact
you
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
many
a
life
has
been
injured
by
the
constant
expectation
of
death
it
is
life
we
have
to
do
with
not
death
the
best
preparation
for
the
night
is
to
work
while
the
day
lasts
diligently
the
best
preparation
for
death
is
life
besides
i
have
known
delicate
people
who
have
outlived
all
their
strong
relations
and
been
left
alone
in
the
earth
because
they
had
possibly
taken
too
much
care
of
themselves
but
marriage
is
god
s
will
and
death
is
god
s
will
and
you
have
no
business
to
set
the
one
over
against
as
antagonistic
to
the
other
for
anything
you
know
the
gladness
and
the
peace
of
marriage
may
be
the
very
means
intended
for
your
restoration
to
health
and
strength
i
suspect
your
desire
to
marry
fighting
against
the
fancy
that
you
ought
not
to
marry
has
a
good
deal
to
do
with
the
state
of
health
in
which
you
now
find
yourself
a
man
would
get
over
many
things
if
he
were
happy
that
he
can
not
get
over
when
he
is
but
it
s
for
aggy
you
forget
i
do
not
forget
it
what
right
have
you
to
seek
for
her
another
kind
of
welfare
than
you
would
have
yourself
are
you
to
treat
her
as
if
she
were
worldly
when
you
are
not
to
provide
for
her
a
comfort
which
yourself
you
would
despise
why
should
you
not
marry
because
you
have
to
die
soon
if
you
thus
doomed
which
to
me
is
by
no
means
clear
why
not
have
what
happiness
you
may
for
the
rest
of
your
sojourn
if
you
find
at
the
end
of
twenty
years
that
here
you
are
after
all
you
will
be
rather
sorry
you
did
not
do
as
i
and
if
i
find
myself
dying
at
the
end
of
six
months
you
will
thank
god
for
those
six
months
the
whole
thing
my
dear
fellow
is
a
want
of
faith
in
god
i
do
not
doubt
you
think
you
are
doing
right
but
i
repeat
the
whole
thing
comes
from
want
of
faith
in
god
you
will
take
things
into
your
own
hands
and
order
them
after
a
preventive
and
fashion
lest
god
should
have
ordained
the
worst
for
you
which
worst
after
all
would
be
best
met
by
doing
his
will
without
inquiry
into
the
future
and
which
worst
is
no
evil
death
is
no
more
an
evil
than
marriage
but
you
don
t
see
it
as
i
do
persisted
the
blacksmith
of
course
i
don
t
i
think
you
see
it
as
it
is
he
remained
silent
for
a
little
a
shower
of
spray
fell
upon
us
he
started
what
a
wave
he
cried
that
spray
came
over
the
top
of
the
rock
we
shall
have
to
run
for
i
fancied
that
he
only
wanted
to
avoid
further
conversation
there
s
no
hurry
i
said
it
was
high
water
an
hour
and
a
half
you
don
t
know
this
coast
sir
returned
he
or
you
wouldn
t
talk
like
as
he
spoke
he
rose
and
going
from
under
the
shelter
of
the
rock
looked
along
for
god
s
sake
aggy
he
cried
in
terror
come
at
once
every
other
wave
be
rushing
across
the
breakwater
as
if
it
was
on
the
so
saying
he
hurried
back
caught
her
by
the
hand
and
began
to
draw
her
along
hadn
t
we
better
stay
where
we
are
i
suggested
if
you
can
stand
the
night
in
the
cold
but
aggy
here
is
delicate
and
i
don
t
care
about
being
out
all
night
it
s
not
the
tide
sir
it
s
a
ground
swell
from
a
storm
somewhere
out
at
sea
that
never
asks
no
questions
about
tide
or
no
come
along
then
i
said
but
just
wait
one
minute
more
it
is
better
to
be
ready
for
the
for
i
remembered
that
the
day
before
i
had
seen
a
crowbar
lying
among
the
stones
and
i
thought
it
might
be
useful
in
a
moment
or
two
i
had
found
it
and
returning
gave
it
to
joe
then
i
took
the
girl
s
disengaged
hand
she
thanked
me
in
a
voice
perfectly
calm
and
firm
joe
took
the
bar
in
haste
and
drew
agnes
towards
the
breakwater
any
real
thought
of
danger
had
not
yet
crossed
my
mind
but
when
i
looked
along
the
outstretched
back
of
the
mole
and
saw
a
dim
sheet
of
white
sweep
across
it
i
felt
that
there
was
ground
for
his
anxiety
and
prepared
myself
for
a
struggle
do
you
know
what
to
do
with
the
crowbar
joe
i
said
grasping
my
own
stout
more
firmly
perfectly
answered
joe
to
stick
between
the
stones
and
hold
on
we
must
watch
our
time
between
the
you
take
the
command
then
joe
i
returned
you
see
better
than
i
do
and
you
know
the
ways
of
that
raging
wild
beast
there
better
than
i
do
i
will
obey
orders
one
of
which
no
doubt
will
be
not
for
wind
or
sea
to
lose
hold
of
agnes
eh
joe
joe
gave
a
grim
enough
laugh
in
reply
and
we
started
he
carrying
his
crowbar
in
his
right
hand
towards
the
advancing
sea
and
i
my
in
my
left
towards
the
still
water
within
quick
march
said
joe
and
away
we
went
out
on
the
breakwater
now
the
back
of
the
breakwater
was
very
rugged
for
it
was
formed
of
huge
stones
with
wide
gaps
between
where
the
waters
had
washed
out
the
cement
and
worn
their
edges
but
what
impeded
our
progress
secured
our
safety
halt
cried
joe
when
we
were
yet
but
a
few
yards
beyond
the
shelter
of
the
rocks
there
s
a
topper
we
halted
at
the
word
of
command
as
a
huge
wave
with
combing
crest
rushed
against
the
far
base
of
the
mole
and
flung
its
heavy
top
right
over
the
middle
of
the
mass
a
score
or
two
of
yards
in
front
of
us
now
for
it
cried
joe
run
we
did
run
in
my
mind
there
was
just
sense
enough
of
danger
to
add
to
the
pleasure
of
the
excitement
i
did
not
know
how
much
danger
there
was
over
the
rough
worn
stones
we
sped
stumbling
halt
cried
the
smith
once
more
and
we
did
halt
but
this
time
as
it
turned
out
in
the
middle
front
of
the
coming
danger
god
be
with
us
i
exclaimed
when
the
huge
billow
showed
itself
through
the
night
rushing
towards
the
mole
the
smith
stuck
his
crowbar
between
two
great
stones
to
this
he
held
on
with
one
hand
and
threw
the
other
arm
round
agnes
s
waist
i
too
had
got
my
oak
firmly
fixed
held
on
with
one
hand
and
threw
the
other
arm
round
agnes
it
took
but
a
moment
now
then
cried
joe
here
she
comes
hold
on
sir
hold
on
aggy
but
when
i
saw
the
height
of
the
water
as
it
rushed
on
us
up
the
sloping
side
of
the
mound
i
cried
out
in
my
turn
down
joe
down
on
your
face
and
let
it
over
us
easy
down
agnes
they
obeyed
we
threw
ourselves
across
the
breakwater
with
our
heads
to
the
coming
foe
and
i
grasped
my
stick
close
to
the
stones
with
all
the
power
of
a
hand
that
was
then
strong
over
us
burst
the
mighty
wave
floating
us
up
from
the
stones
where
we
lay
but
we
held
on
the
wave
passed
and
we
sprung
gasping
to
our
feet
now
now
cried
joe
and
i
together
and
heavy
as
we
were
with
the
water
pouring
from
us
we
flew
across
the
remainder
of
the
heap
and
arrived
panting
and
safe
at
the
other
end
ere
one
wave
more
had
swept
the
surface
the
moment
we
were
in
safety
we
turned
and
looked
back
over
the
danger
we
had
traversed
it
was
to
see
a
huge
billow
sweep
the
breakwater
from
end
to
end
we
looked
at
each
other
for
a
moment
without
speaking
i
believe
sir
said
joe
at
length
with
slow
and
solemn
speech
if
you
hadn
t
taken
the
command
at
that
moment
we
should
all
have
been
it
seems
likely
enough
when
i
look
back
on
it
for
one
thing
i
was
not
sure
that
my
stick
would
stand
so
i
thought
i
had
better
grasp
it
low
we
were
awfully
near
death
said
joe
nearer
than
you
thought
joe
and
yet
we
escaped
it
things
don
t
go
all
as
we
fancy
you
see
faith
is
as
essential
to
manhood
as
foresight
believe
me
joe
it
is
very
absurd
to
trust
god
for
the
future
and
not
trust
him
for
the
present
the
man
who
is
not
anxious
is
the
man
most
likely
to
do
the
right
thing
he
is
cool
and
collected
and
ready
our
lord
therefore
told
his
disciples
that
when
they
should
be
brought
before
kings
and
rulers
they
were
to
take
no
thought
what
answer
they
should
make
for
it
would
be
given
them
when
the
time
we
were
climbing
the
steep
path
up
to
the
downs
neither
of
my
companions
spoke
you
have
escaped
one
death
together
i
said
at
length
dare
still
neither
of
them
returned
an
answer
when
we
came
near
the
parsonage
i
said
now
joe
you
must
go
in
and
get
to
bed
at
once
i
will
take
agnes
home
you
can
trust
me
not
to
say
anything
against
you
joe
laughed
rather
hoarsely
and
replied
as
you
please
sir
good
night
aggie
mind
you
get
to
bed
as
fast
as
you
when
i
returned
from
giving
agnes
over
to
her
parents
i
made
haste
to
change
my
clothes
and
put
on
my
warm
i
may
as
well
mention
at
once
that
not
one
of
us
was
the
worse
for
our
ducking
i
then
went
up
to
connie
s
room
here
i
am
you
see
connie
quite
i
ve
been
lying
listening
to
every
blast
of
wind
since
you
went
out
papa
but
all
i
could
do
was
to
trust
in
do
you
call
that
connie
believe
me
there
is
more
power
in
that
than
any
human
being
knows
the
tenth
part
of
yet
it
is
indeed
i
said
no
more
then
i
told
my
wife
about
it
that
night
but
we
were
well
into
another
month
before
i
told
connie
when
i
left
her
i
went
to
joe
s
room
to
see
how
he
was
and
found
him
having
some
gruel
i
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
his
bed
and
said
well
joe
this
is
better
than
under
water
i
hope
you
won
t
be
the
worse
for
i
don
t
much
care
what
comes
of
me
sir
it
will
be
all
over
but
you
ought
to
care
what
comes
of
you
joe
i
will
tell
you
why
you
are
an
instrument
out
of
which
ought
to
come
praise
to
god
and
therefore
you
ought
to
care
for
the
that
way
yes
sir
i
and
you
have
no
business
to
be
like
some
children
who
say
mamma
won
t
give
me
so
and
so
instead
of
asking
her
to
give
it
i
see
what
you
mean
sir
but
really
you
put
me
out
before
the
young
woman
i
couldn
t
say
before
her
what
i
meant
suppose
you
know
sir
there
was
to
come
a
family
it
might
be
you
of
course
what
else
would
you
have
but
if
i
was
to
die
where
would
she
be
then
in
god
s
hands
just
as
she
is
but
i
ought
to
take
care
that
she
is
not
left
with
a
burden
like
that
to
provide
o
joe
how
little
you
know
a
woman
s
heart
it
would
just
be
the
greatest
comfort
she
could
have
for
losing
you
that
s
all
many
a
woman
has
married
a
man
she
did
not
care
enough
for
just
that
she
might
have
a
child
of
her
own
to
let
out
her
heart
upon
i
don
t
say
that
is
right
you
know
such
love
can
not
be
perfect
a
woman
ought
to
love
her
child
because
it
is
her
husband
s
more
than
because
it
is
her
own
and
because
it
is
god
s
more
than
either
s
i
saw
in
the
papers
the
other
day
that
a
woman
was
brought
before
the
recorder
of
london
for
stealing
a
baby
when
the
judge
himself
said
that
there
was
no
imaginable
motive
for
her
action
but
a
motherly
passion
to
possess
the
child
it
is
the
need
of
a
child
that
makes
so
many
women
take
to
poor
miserable
for
they
are
and
can
not
face
the
troubles
and
dangers
of
adopting
a
child
they
would
if
they
might
get
one
of
a
good
family
or
from
a
respectable
home
but
they
dare
not
take
an
orphan
out
of
the
dirt
lest
it
should
spoil
their
silken
chairs
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
our
argument
what
i
mean
is
this
that
if
agnes
really
loves
you
as
no
one
can
look
in
her
face
and
doubt
she
will
be
far
happier
if
you
leave
her
a
child
yes
she
will
be
happier
if
you
only
leave
her
your
name
for
hers
than
if
you
died
without
calling
her
your
i
took
joe
s
basin
from
him
and
he
lay
down
he
turned
his
face
to
the
wall
i
waited
a
moment
but
finding
him
silent
bade
him
and
left
the
room
a
month
after
i
married
them
chapter
xiii
the
harvest
it
was
some
time
before
we
got
the
bells
to
work
to
our
mind
but
at
last
we
succeeded
the
worst
of
it
was
to
get
the
cranks
which
at
first
required
strong
pressure
on
the
keys
to
work
easily
enough
but
neither
joe
nor
his
cousin
spared
any
pains
to
perfect
the
attempt
and
as
i
say
at
length
we
succeeded
i
took
wynnie
down
to
the
instrument
and
made
her
try
whether
she
could
not
do
something
and
she
succeeded
in
making
the
old
tower
discourse
loudly
and
eloquently
by
this
time
the
thanksgiving
for
the
harvest
was
at
hand
on
the
morning
of
that
first
of
all
would
i
summon
the
folk
to
their
prayers
with
the
sound
of
the
full
peal
and
i
wrote
a
little
hymn
of
praise
to
the
god
of
the
harvest
modelling
it
to
one
of
the
oldest
tunes
in
that
part
of
the
country
and
i
had
it
printed
on
slips
of
paper
and
laid
plentifully
on
the
benches
what
with
the
calling
of
the
bells
like
voices
in
the
highway
and
the
solemn
meditation
of
the
organ
within
to
bear
aloft
the
thoughts
of
those
who
heard
and
came
to
the
prayer
and
thanksgiving
in
common
and
the
message
which
god
had
given
me
to
utter
to
them
i
hoped
that
we
should
indeed
keep
holiday
wynnie
summoned
the
parish
with
the
hundredth
psalm
pealed
from
aloft
dropping
from
the
airy
regions
of
the
tower
on
village
and
hamlet
and
cottage
calling
aloud
for
who
could
dissociate
the
words
from
the
music
though
the
words
are
in
the
scotch
psalms
written
none
the
less
by
an
englishman
however
english
wits
may
amuse
themselves
with
laughing
at
their
quaintness
calling
aloud
all
people
that
on
earth
do
dwell
sing
to
the
lord
with
cheerful
voice
him
serve
with
mirth
his
praise
forth
tell
come
ye
before
him
and
then
we
sang
the
psalm
before
the
communion
service
making
bold
in
the
name
of
the
lord
to
serve
him
with
as
in
the
old
version
and
not
with
the
with
which
some
editor
weak
in
faith
has
presumed
to
alter
the
line
then
before
the
sermon
we
sang
the
hymn
i
had
prepared
a
proceeding
justifiable
by
many
an
example
in
the
history
of
the
church
while
she
was
not
only
able
to
number
singers
amongst
her
clergy
but
those
singers
were
capable
of
influencing
the
whole
heart
and
judgment
of
the
nation
with
their
songs
ethelwyn
played
the
organ
the
song
i
had
prepared
was
this
we
praise
the
life
of
all
from
buried
seeds
so
small
who
makes
the
ordered
ranks
of
autumn
stand
who
stores
the
corn
in
rick
and
barn
to
feed
the
winter
of
the
land
we
praise
the
life
of
light
who
from
the
brooding
night
draws
out
the
morning
holy
calm
and
grand
veils
up
the
moon
sends
out
the
sun
to
glad
the
face
of
all
the
land
we
praise
the
life
of
work
who
from
sleep
s
lonely
dark
leads
forth
his
children
to
arise
and
stand
then
go
their
way
the
day
to
trust
and
labour
in
the
land
we
praise
the
life
of
good
who
breaks
sin
s
lazy
mood
toilsomely
ploughing
up
the
fruitless
sand
the
furrowed
waste
they
leave
and
haste
home
home
to
till
their
father
s
land
we
praise
the
life
of
life
who
in
this
soil
of
strife
casts
us
at
birth
like
seed
from
sower
s
hand
to
die
and
so
like
corn
to
grow
a
golden
harvest
in
his
after
we
had
sung
this
hymn
the
meaning
of
which
is
far
better
than
the
versification
i
preached
from
the
words
of
paul
if
by
any
means
i
might
attain
unto
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
not
as
though
i
had
already
attained
either
were
already
and
this
is
something
like
what
i
said
to
them
the
world
my
friends
is
full
of
resurrections
and
it
is
not
always
of
the
same
resurrection
that
paul
speaks
every
night
that
folds
us
up
in
darkness
is
a
death
and
those
of
you
that
have
been
out
early
and
have
seen
the
first
of
the
dawn
will
know
it
the
day
rises
out
of
the
night
like
a
being
that
has
burst
its
tomb
and
escaped
into
life
that
you
may
feel
that
the
sunrise
is
a
resurrection
the
word
resurrection
just
means
a
rising
again
i
will
read
you
a
little
description
of
it
from
a
sermon
by
a
great
writer
and
great
preacher
called
jeremy
taylor
listen
but
as
when
the
sun
approaching
towards
the
gates
of
the
morning
he
first
opens
a
little
eye
of
heaven
and
sends
away
the
spirits
of
darkness
and
gives
light
to
a
cock
and
calls
up
the
lark
to
matins
and
by
and
by
gilds
the
fringes
of
a
cloud
and
peeps
over
the
eastern
hills
thrusting
out
his
golden
horns
like
those
which
decked
the
brows
of
moses
when
he
was
forced
to
wear
a
veil
because
himself
had
seen
the
face
of
god
and
still
while
a
man
tells
the
story
the
sun
gets
up
higher
till
he
shows
a
fair
face
and
a
full
light
and
then
he
shines
one
whole
day
under
a
cloud
often
and
sometimes
weeping
great
and
little
showers
and
sets
quickly
so
is
a
man
s
reason
and
his
is
not
this
a
resurrection
of
the
day
out
of
the
night
or
hear
how
milton
makes
his
adam
and
eve
praise
god
in
the
morning
ye
mists
and
exhalations
that
now
rise
from
hill
or
streaming
lake
dusky
or
gray
till
the
sun
paint
your
fleecy
skirts
with
gold
in
honour
to
the
world
s
great
author
rise
whether
to
deck
with
clouds
the
uncoloured
sky
or
wet
the
thirsty
earth
with
falling
showers
rising
or
falling
still
advance
his
but
it
is
yet
more
of
a
resurrection
to
you
think
of
your
own
condition
through
the
night
and
in
the
morning
you
die
as
it
were
every
night
the
death
of
darkness
comes
down
over
the
earth
but
a
deeper
death
the
death
of
sleep
descends
on
you
a
power
overshadows
you
your
eyelids
close
you
can
not
keep
them
open
if
you
would
your
limbs
lie
moveless
the
day
is
gone
your
whole
life
is
gone
you
have
forgotten
everything
an
evil
man
might
come
and
do
with
your
goods
as
he
pleased
you
are
helpless
but
the
god
of
the
resurrection
is
awake
all
the
time
watching
his
sleeping
men
and
women
even
as
a
mother
who
watches
her
sleeping
baby
only
with
larger
eyes
and
more
full
of
love
than
hers
and
so
you
know
not
how
all
at
once
you
know
that
you
are
what
you
are
that
there
is
a
world
that
wants
you
outside
of
you
and
a
god
that
wants
you
inside
of
you
you
rise
from
the
death
of
sleep
not
by
your
own
power
for
you
knew
nothing
about
it
god
put
his
hand
over
your
eyes
and
you
were
dead
he
lifted
his
hand
and
breathed
light
on
you
and
you
rose
from
the
dead
thanked
the
god
who
raised
you
up
and
went
forth
to
do
your
work
from
darkness
to
light
from
blindness
to
seeing
from
knowing
nothing
to
looking
abroad
on
the
mighty
world
from
helpless
submission
to
willing
obedience
is
not
this
a
resurrection
indeed
that
paul
saw
it
to
be
such
may
be
shown
from
his
using
the
two
things
with
the
same
meaning
when
he
says
awake
thou
that
sleepest
and
arise
from
the
dead
and
christ
shall
give
thee
no
doubt
he
meant
a
great
deal
more
no
man
who
understands
what
he
is
speaking
about
can
well
mean
only
one
thing
at
a
time
but
to
return
to
the
resurrections
we
see
around
us
in
nature
look
at
the
death
that
falls
upon
the
world
in
winter
and
look
how
it
revives
when
the
sun
draws
near
enough
in
the
spring
to
wile
the
life
in
it
once
more
out
of
its
grave
see
how
the
pale
meek
snowdrops
come
up
with
their
bowed
heads
as
if
full
of
the
memory
of
the
fierce
winds
they
encountered
last
spring
and
yet
ready
in
the
strength
of
their
weakness
to
encounter
them
again
up
comes
the
crocus
bringing
its
gold
safe
from
the
dark
of
its
colourless
grave
into
the
light
of
its
parent
gold
primroses
and
anemones
and
and
a
thousand
other
children
of
the
spring
hear
the
of
the
wind
from
the
west
and
south
obey
and
leave
their
graves
behind
to
breathe
the
air
of
the
sweet
heavens
up
and
up
they
come
till
the
year
is
glorious
with
the
rose
and
the
lily
till
the
trees
are
not
only
clothed
upon
with
new
garments
of
loveliest
green
but
the
bringeth
forth
its
fruit
and
the
little
children
of
men
are
made
glad
with
apples
and
cherries
and
the
earth
laughs
out
in
green
and
gold
the
sky
shares
in
the
grand
resurrection
the
garments
of
its
mourning
wherewith
it
made
men
sad
its
clouds
of
snow
and
hail
and
stormy
vapours
are
swept
away
have
sunk
indeed
to
the
earth
and
are
now
humbly
feeding
the
roots
of
the
flowers
whose
dead
stalks
they
beat
upon
all
the
winter
long
instead
the
sky
has
put
on
the
garments
of
praise
her
blue
coloured
after
the
on
which
stands
the
throne
of
him
who
is
the
resurrection
and
the
life
is
dashed
and
glorified
with
the
pure
white
of
sailing
clouds
and
at
morning
and
evening
prayer
puts
on
colours
in
which
the
human
heart
drowns
itself
with
delight
green
and
gold
and
purple
and
rose
even
the
icebergs
floating
about
in
the
lonely
summer
seas
of
the
north
are
flashing
all
the
glories
of
the
rainbow
but
indeed
is
not
this
whole
world
itself
a
monument
of
the
resurrection
the
earth
was
without
form
and
void
the
wind
of
god
moved
on
the
face
of
the
waters
and
up
arose
this
fair
world
darkness
was
on
the
face
of
the
deep
god
said
let
there
be
light
and
there
was
light
in
the
animal
world
as
well
you
behold
the
goings
of
the
resurrection
plainest
of
all
look
at
the
story
of
the
butterfly
so
plain
that
the
pagan
greeks
called
it
and
the
soul
by
one
name
psyche
psyche
meant
with
them
a
butterfly
or
the
soul
either
look
how
the
creeping
thing
ugly
to
our
eyes
so
that
we
can
hardly
handle
it
without
a
shudder
finding
itself
growing
sick
with
age
straightway
falls
a
spinning
and
weaving
at
its
own
shroud
coffin
and
grave
all
in
one
to
prepare
in
fact
for
its
resurrection
for
it
is
for
the
sake
of
the
resurrection
that
death
exists
patiently
it
spins
its
strength
but
not
its
life
away
folds
itself
up
decently
that
its
body
may
rest
in
quiet
till
the
new
body
is
formed
within
it
and
at
length
when
the
appointed
hour
has
arrived
out
of
the
body
of
this
crawling
thing
breaks
forth
the
winged
splendour
of
the
butterfly
not
the
same
body
a
new
one
built
out
of
the
ruins
of
the
old
even
as
paul
tells
us
that
it
is
not
the
same
body
have
in
the
resurrection
but
a
nobler
body
like
ourselves
with
all
the
imperfect
and
evil
thing
taken
away
no
more
creeping
for
the
butterfly
wings
of
splendour
now
neither
yet
has
it
lost
the
feet
wherewith
to
alight
on
all
that
is
lovely
and
sweet
think
of
it
up
from
the
toilsome
journey
over
the
low
ground
exposed
to
the
foot
of
every
destroying
the
lovely
leaves
upon
which
it
fed
and
the
fruit
which
they
should
shelter
up
to
the
path
at
will
through
the
air
and
a
gathering
of
food
which
hurts
not
the
source
of
it
a
food
which
is
but
as
a
tribute
from
the
loveliness
of
the
flowers
to
the
yet
higher
loveliness
of
the
is
not
this
a
resurrection
its
children
too
shall
pass
through
the
same
process
to
wing
the
air
of
a
summer
noon
and
rejoice
in
the
ethereal
and
the
pure
to
return
yet
again
from
the
human
thoughts
suggested
by
the
symbol
of
the
butterfly
here
let
me
pause
for
a
moment
and
there
was
a
corresponding
pause
though
but
momentary
in
the
sermon
as
i
spoke
it
to
mention
a
curious
and
to
me
at
the
moment
an
interesting
fact
at
this
point
of
my
address
i
caught
sight
of
a
white
butterfly
a
belated
one
flitting
about
the
church
absorbed
for
a
moment
my
eye
wandered
after
it
it
was
near
the
bench
where
my
own
people
sat
and
for
one
flash
of
thought
i
longed
that
the
butterfly
would
alight
on
my
wynnie
for
i
was
more
anxious
about
her
resurrection
at
the
time
than
about
anything
else
but
the
butterfly
would
not
and
then
i
told
myself
that
god
would
and
that
the
butterfly
was
only
the
symbol
of
a
grand
truth
and
of
no
private
interpretation
to
make
which
of
it
was
both
selfishness
and
superstition
but
all
this
passed
in
a
flash
and
i
resumed
my
discourse
i
come
now
naturally
to
speak
of
what
we
commonly
call
the
resurrection
some
say
how
can
the
same
dust
be
raised
again
when
it
may
be
scattered
to
the
winds
of
heaven
it
is
a
question
i
hardly
care
to
answer
the
mere
difficulty
can
in
reason
stand
for
nothing
with
god
but
the
apparent
worthlessness
of
the
supposition
renders
the
question
uninteresting
to
me
what
is
of
import
is
that
i
should
stand
clothed
upon
with
a
body
which
is
body
because
it
serves
my
ends
justifies
my
consciousness
of
identity
by
being
in
all
that
was
good
in
it
like
that
which
i
had
before
while
now
it
is
tenfold
capable
of
expressing
the
thoughts
and
feelings
that
move
within
me
how
can
i
care
whether
the
atoms
that
form
a
certain
inch
of
bone
should
be
the
same
as
those
which
formed
that
bone
when
i
died
all
my
i
never
felt
or
thought
of
the
existence
of
such
a
bone
on
the
other
hand
i
object
to
having
the
same
worn
muscles
the
same
shrivelled
skin
with
which
i
may
happen
to
die
why
give
me
the
same
body
as
that
why
not
rather
my
youthful
body
which
was
strong
and
facile
and
capable
the
matter
in
the
muscle
of
my
arm
at
death
would
not
serve
to
make
half
the
muscle
i
had
when
young
but
i
thank
god
that
paul
says
it
will
be
the
same
body
that
body
dies
up
springs
another
body
i
suspect
myself
that
those
are
right
who
say
that
this
body
being
the
seed
the
moment
it
dies
in
the
soil
of
this
world
that
moment
is
the
resurrection
of
the
new
body
the
life
in
it
rises
out
of
it
in
a
new
body
this
is
not
after
it
is
put
in
the
mere
earth
for
it
is
dead
then
and
the
germ
of
life
gone
out
of
it
if
a
seed
rots
no
new
body
comes
of
it
the
seed
dies
into
a
new
life
and
so
does
man
dying
and
rotting
are
two
very
different
but
i
am
not
sure
by
any
means
as
i
say
the
whole
question
is
rather
uninteresting
to
me
what
do
i
care
about
my
old
clothes
after
i
have
done
with
them
what
is
it
to
me
to
know
what
becomes
of
an
old
coat
or
an
old
pulpit
gown
i
have
no
such
clinging
to
the
flesh
it
seems
to
me
that
people
believe
their
bodies
to
be
themselves
and
are
therefore
very
anxious
about
them
and
no
wonder
then
enough
for
me
that
i
shall
have
eyes
to
see
my
friends
a
face
that
they
shall
know
me
by
and
a
mouth
to
praise
god
withal
i
leave
the
matter
with
one
remark
that
i
am
well
content
to
rise
as
jesus
rose
however
that
was
for
me
the
will
of
god
is
so
good
that
i
would
rather
have
his
will
done
than
my
own
choice
given
me
but
i
now
come
to
the
last
because
infinitely
the
most
important
part
of
my
subject
the
resurrection
for
the
sake
of
which
all
the
other
resurrections
exist
the
resurrection
unto
life
this
is
the
one
of
which
paul
speaks
in
my
text
this
is
the
one
i
am
most
anxious
indeed
the
only
one
i
am
anxious
to
set
forth
and
impress
upon
you
think
then
of
all
the
deaths
you
know
the
death
of
the
night
when
the
sun
is
gone
when
friend
says
not
a
word
to
friend
but
both
lie
drowned
and
parted
in
the
sea
of
sleep
the
death
of
the
year
when
winter
lies
heavy
on
the
graves
of
the
children
of
summer
when
the
leafless
trees
moan
in
the
blasts
from
the
ocean
when
the
beasts
even
look
dull
and
oppressed
when
the
children
go
about
shivering
with
cold
when
the
poor
and
improvident
are
miserable
with
suffering
or
think
of
such
a
death
of
disease
as
befalls
us
at
times
when
the
man
who
says
would
god
it
were
morning
changes
but
his
word
and
not
his
tune
when
the
morning
comes
crying
would
god
it
were
evening
when
what
life
is
left
is
known
to
us
only
by
suffering
and
hope
is
amongst
the
things
that
were
once
and
are
no
more
think
of
all
these
think
of
them
all
together
and
you
will
have
but
the
dimmest
faintest
picture
of
the
death
from
which
the
resurrection
of
which
i
have
now
to
speak
is
the
rising
i
shrink
from
the
attempt
knowing
how
weak
words
are
to
set
forth
death
set
forth
resurrection
were
i
to
sit
down
to
yonder
organ
and
crash
out
the
most
horrible
dissonances
that
ever
took
shape
in
sound
i
should
give
you
but
a
weak
figure
of
this
death
were
i
capable
of
drawing
from
many
a
row
of
pipes
an
exhalation
of
dulcet
symphonies
and
voices
sweet
such
as
milton
himself
could
have
invaded
our
ears
withal
i
could
give
you
but
a
faint
figure
of
this
resurrection
nevertheless
i
must
try
what
i
can
do
in
my
own
way
if
into
the
face
of
the
dead
body
lying
on
the
bed
waiting
for
its
burial
the
soul
of
the
man
should
begin
to
dawn
again
drawing
near
from
afar
to
look
out
once
more
at
those
eyes
to
smile
once
again
through
those
lips
the
change
on
that
face
would
be
indeed
great
and
wondrous
but
nothing
for
marvel
or
greatness
to
that
which
passes
on
the
countenance
the
very
outward
bodily
face
of
the
man
who
wakes
from
his
sleep
arises
from
the
dead
and
receives
light
from
christ
too
often
indeed
the
reposeful
look
on
the
face
of
the
dead
body
would
be
troubled
would
vanish
away
at
the
revisiting
of
the
restless
ghost
but
when
a
man
s
own
right
true
mind
which
god
made
in
him
is
restored
to
him
again
and
he
wakes
from
the
death
of
sin
then
comes
the
repose
without
the
death
it
may
take
long
for
the
new
spirit
to
complete
the
visible
change
but
it
begins
at
once
and
will
be
perfected
the
bloated
look
of
passes
away
like
the
leprosy
of
naaman
the
cheek
grows
pure
the
lips
return
to
the
smile
of
hope
instead
of
the
grin
of
greed
and
the
eyes
that
made
innocence
shrink
and
shudder
with
their
yellow
leer
grow
childlike
and
sweet
and
faithful
the
hitherto
fixed
on
the
earth
are
lifted
to
meet
their
kind
the
lips
that
mumbled
over
figures
and
sums
of
gold
learn
to
say
words
of
grace
and
tenderness
the
truculent
repellent
face
begins
to
look
thoughtful
and
doubtful
as
if
searching
for
some
treasure
of
whose
whereabouts
it
had
no
certain
sign
the
face
anxious
wrinkled
peering
troubled
on
whose
lines
you
read
the
dread
of
hunger
poverty
and
nakedness
thaws
into
a
smile
the
eyes
reflect
in
courage
the
light
of
the
father
s
care
the
back
grows
erect
under
its
burden
with
the
assurance
that
the
hairs
of
its
head
are
all
numbered
but
the
face
can
with
all
its
changes
set
but
dimly
forth
the
rising
from
the
dead
which
passes
within
the
heart
which
cared
but
for
itself
becomes
aware
of
surrounding
thousands
like
itself
in
the
love
and
care
of
which
it
feels
a
dawning
blessedness
undreamt
of
before
from
selfishness
to
love
is
not
this
a
rising
from
the
dead
the
man
whose
ambition
declares
that
his
way
in
the
world
would
be
to
subject
everything
to
his
desires
to
bring
every
human
care
affection
power
and
aspiration
to
his
feet
such
a
world
it
would
be
and
such
a
king
it
would
have
if
individual
ambition
might
work
its
will
if
a
man
s
opinion
of
himself
could
be
made
out
in
the
world
degrading
compelling
oppressing
doing
everything
for
his
own
glory
and
such
a
glory
but
a
pang
of
light
strikes
this
man
to
the
heart
an
arrow
of
truth
feathered
with
suffering
and
loss
and
dismay
finds
out
the
open
joint
in
his
armour
i
was
going
to
say
no
finds
out
the
joint
in
the
coffin
where
his
heart
lies
festering
in
a
death
so
dead
that
itself
calls
it
life
he
trembles
he
awakes
he
rises
from
the
dead
no
more
he
seeks
the
slavery
of
all
where
can
he
find
whom
to
serve
how
can
he
become
if
but
a
threshold
in
the
temple
of
christ
where
all
serve
all
and
no
man
thinks
first
of
himself
he
to
whom
the
mass
of
his
fellows
as
he
massed
them
was
common
and
unclean
bows
before
every
human
sign
of
the
presence
of
the
making
god
the
sun
which
was
to
him
but
a
candle
with
which
to
search
after
his
own
ends
wealth
power
place
praise
the
world
which
was
but
the
cavern
where
he
thus
searched
are
now
full
of
the
mystery
of
loveliness
full
of
the
truth
of
which
sun
and
wind
and
land
and
sea
are
symbols
and
signs
from
a
withered
old
age
of
unbelief
the
dim
eyes
of
which
refuse
the
glory
of
things
a
passage
to
the
heart
he
is
raised
up
a
child
full
of
admiration
wonder
and
gladness
everything
is
glorious
to
him
he
can
believe
and
therefore
he
sees
it
is
from
the
grave
into
the
sunshine
from
the
night
into
the
morning
from
death
into
life
to
come
out
of
the
ugly
into
the
beautiful
out
of
the
mean
and
selfish
into
the
noble
and
loving
out
of
the
paltry
into
the
great
out
of
the
false
into
the
true
out
of
the
filthy
into
the
clean
out
of
the
commonplace
into
the
glorious
out
of
the
corruption
of
disease
into
the
fine
vigour
and
gracious
movements
of
health
in
a
word
out
of
evil
into
good
is
not
this
a
resurrection
indeed
resurrection
of
all
the
resurrection
of
life
god
grant
that
with
paul
we
may
attain
to
this
resurrection
of
the
dead
this
rising
from
the
dead
is
often
a
long
and
a
painful
process
even
after
he
had
preached
the
gospel
to
the
gentiles
and
suffered
much
for
the
sake
of
his
master
paul
sees
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
towering
grandly
before
him
not
yet
climbed
not
yet
attained
unto
a
mountainous
splendour
and
marvel
still
shining
aloft
in
the
air
of
existence
still
thank
god
to
be
attained
but
ever
growing
in
height
and
beauty
as
forgetting
those
things
that
are
behind
he
presses
towards
the
mark
if
by
any
means
he
may
attain
to
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
every
blessed
moment
in
which
a
man
bethinks
himself
that
he
has
been
forgetting
his
high
calling
and
sends
up
to
the
father
a
prayer
for
aid
every
time
a
man
resolves
that
what
he
has
been
doing
he
will
do
no
more
every
time
that
the
love
of
god
or
the
feeling
of
the
truth
rouses
a
man
to
look
first
up
at
the
light
then
down
at
the
skirts
of
his
own
garments
that
moment
a
divine
resurrection
is
wrought
in
the
earth
yea
every
time
that
a
man
passes
from
resentment
to
forgiveness
from
cruelty
to
compassion
from
hardness
to
tenderness
from
indifference
to
carefulness
from
selfishness
to
honesty
from
honesty
to
generosity
from
generosity
to
love
a
resurrection
the
bursting
of
a
fresh
bud
of
life
out
of
the
grave
of
evil
gladdens
the
eye
of
the
father
watching
his
children
awake
then
thou
that
sleepest
and
arise
from
the
dead
and
christ
will
give
thee
light
as
the
harvest
rises
from
the
wintry
earth
so
rise
thou
up
from
the
trials
of
this
world
a
full
ear
in
the
harvest
of
him
who
sowed
thee
in
the
soil
that
thou
mightest
rise
above
it
as
the
summer
rises
from
the
winter
so
rise
thou
from
the
cares
of
eating
and
drinking
and
clothing
into
the
fearless
sunshine
of
confidence
in
the
father
as
the
morning
rises
out
of
the
night
so
rise
thou
from
the
darkness
of
ignorance
to
do
the
will
of
god
in
the
daylight
and
as
a
man
feels
that
he
is
himself
when
he
wakes
from
the
troubled
and
grotesque
visions
of
the
night
into
the
glory
of
the
sunrise
even
so
wilt
thou
feel
that
then
first
thou
knowest
what
thy
life
the
gladness
of
thy
being
is
as
from
painful
tossing
in
disease
rise
into
the
health
of
as
from
the
awful
embrace
of
thy
own
dead
body
burst
forth
in
thy
spiritual
body
arise
thou
responsive
to
the
indwelling
will
of
the
father
even
as
thy
body
will
respond
to
thy
indwelling

chapter
i
a
walk
with
my
wife
the
autumn
was
creeping
up
on
the
earth
with
winter
holding
by
its
skirts
behind
but
before
i
loose
my
hold
of
the
garments
of
summer
i
must
write
a
chapter
about
a
walk
and
a
talk
i
had
one
night
with
my
wife
it
had
rained
a
good
deal
during
the
day
but
as
the
sun
went
down
the
air
began
to
clear
and
when
the
moon
shone
out
near
the
full
she
walked
the
heavens
not
like
one
that
hath
been
led
astray
but
as
queen
and
huntress
chaste
and
what
a
lovely
night
it
is
said
ethelwyn
who
had
come
into
my
study
where
i
always
sat
with
unblinded
windows
that
the
night
and
her
creatures
might
look
in
upon
me
and
had
stood
gazing
out
for
a
moment
shall
we
go
for
a
little
turn
i
said
i
should
like
it
very
much
she
answered
i
will
go
and
put
on
my
bonnet
at
in
a
minute
or
two
she
looked
in
again
all
ready
i
rose
laid
aside
my
plato
and
went
with
her
we
turned
our
steps
along
the
edge
of
the
down
and
descended
upon
the
breakwater
where
we
seated
ourselves
upon
the
same
spot
where
in
the
darkness
i
had
heard
the
voices
of
joe
and
agnes
what
a
different
night
it
was
from
that
the
sea
lay
as
quiet
as
if
it
could
not
move
for
the
moonlight
that
lay
upon
it
the
glory
over
it
was
so
mighty
in
its
peacefulness
that
the
wild
element
beneath
was
afraid
to
toss
itself
even
with
the
motions
of
its
natural
unrest
the
moon
was
like
the
face
of
a
saint
before
which
the
stormy
people
has
grown
dumb
the
rocks
stood
up
solid
and
dark
in
the
universal
aether
and
the
pulse
of
the
ocean
throbbed
against
them
with
a
lapping
gush
soft
as
the
voice
of
a
passionate
child
soothed
into
shame
of
its
vanished
petulance
but
the
sky
was
the
glory
although
no
breath
moved
below
there
was
a
gentle
wind
abroad
in
the
upper
regions
the
air
was
full
of
masses
of
cloud
the
vanishing
fragments
of
the
one
great
vapour
which
had
been
pouring
down
in
rain
the
most
of
the
day
these
masses
were
all
setting
with
one
steady
motion
eastward
into
the
abysses
of
space
now
obscuring
the
fair
moon
now
solemnly
sweeping
away
from
before
her
as
they
departed
out
shone
her
marvellous
radiance
as
calm
as
ever
it
was
plain
that
she
knew
nothing
of
what
we
called
her
covering
her
obscuration
the
dimming
of
her
glory
she
had
been
busy
all
the
time
weaving
her
lovely
opaline
damask
on
the
other
side
of
the
mass
in
which
we
said
she
was
swallowed
up
have
you
ever
noticed
wifie
i
said
how
the
eyes
of
our
minds
almost
our
bodily
eyes
are
opened
sometimes
to
the
cubicalness
of
nature
as
it
were
i
don
t
know
harry
for
i
don
t
understand
your
question
she
answered
well
it
was
a
stupid
way
of
expressing
what
i
meant
no
human
being
could
have
understood
it
from
that
i
will
make
you
understand
in
a
moment
though
sometimes
perhaps
generally
we
see
the
sky
as
a
flat
dome
spangled
with
and
painted
blue
i
see
it
as
an
awful
depth
of
blue
air
depth
within
depth
and
the
clouds
before
me
are
not
passing
away
to
the
left
but
sinking
away
from
the
front
of
me
into
the
marvellous
unknown
regions
which
let
philosophers
say
what
they
will
about
time
and
space
and
i
daresay
they
are
right
are
yet
very
awful
to
me
thank
god
my
dear
i
said
catching
hold
of
her
arm
as
the
terror
of
mere
space
grew
upon
me
for
himself
he
is
deeper
than
space
deeper
than
time
he
is
the
heart
of
all
the
cube
of
i
understand
you
now
husband
said
my
wife
i
knew
you
would
i
answered
but
she
said
again
is
it
not
something
the
same
with
the
things
inside
us
i
can
t
put
it
in
words
as
you
do
do
you
understand
me
now
i
am
not
sure
that
i
do
you
must
try
you
understand
me
well
enough
only
you
like
to
make
me
blunder
where
you
can
talk
said
my
wife
putting
her
hand
in
mine
but
i
will
try
sometimes
after
thinking
about
something
for
a
long
time
you
come
to
a
conclusion
about
it
and
you
think
you
have
settled
it
plain
and
clear
to
yourself
for
ever
and
a
day
you
hang
it
upon
your
wall
like
a
picture
and
are
satisfied
for
a
fortnight
but
some
day
when
you
happen
to
cast
a
look
at
it
you
find
that
instead
of
hanging
flat
on
the
wall
your
picture
has
gone
through
it
opens
out
into
some
region
you
don
t
know
where
shows
you
distances
of
air
and
sea
in
short
where
you
thought
one
question
was
settled
for
ever
a
hundred
are
opened
up
for
the
present
bravo
wife
i
cried
in
true
delight
i
do
indeed
understand
you
now
you
have
said
it
better
than
i
could
ever
have
done
that
s
the
plague
of
you
women
you
have
been
taught
for
centuries
and
centuries
that
there
is
little
or
nothing
to
be
expected
of
you
and
so
you
won
t
try
therefore
we
men
know
no
more
than
you
do
whether
it
is
in
you
or
not
and
when
you
do
try
instead
of
trying
to
think
you
want
to
be
in
parliament
all
at
do
you
apply
that
remark
to
me
sir
demanded
ethelwyn
you
must
submit
to
bear
the
sins
of
your
kind
upon
occasion
i
answered
i
am
content
to
do
that
so
long
as
yours
will
help
mine
she
replied
then
i
may
go
on
i
said
with
interrogation
till
sunrise
if
you
like
we
were
talking
of
the
cubicalness
i
believe
you
called
it
of
and
you
capped
it
with
the
cubicalness
of
thought
and
quite
right
too
there
are
people
as
a
dear
friend
of
mine
used
to
say
who
are
so
accustomed
to
regard
everything
in
the
as
dogma
cut
and
not
dried
my
moral
olfactories
aver
that
if
you
prove
to
them
the
very
thing
they
believe
but
after
another
mode
than
that
they
have
been
accustomed
to
they
are
offended
and
count
you
a
heretic
there
is
no
help
for
it
even
paul
s
chief
opposition
came
from
the
judaizing
christians
of
his
time
who
did
not
believe
that
god
love
the
gentiles
and
therefore
regarded
him
as
a
teacher
of
falsehood
we
must
not
be
fierce
with
them
who
knows
what
wickedness
of
their
ancestors
goes
to
account
for
their
stupidity
for
that
there
are
stupid
people
and
that
they
are
in
very
consequence
of
their
stupidity
conceited
who
can
deny
the
worst
of
it
is
that
no
man
who
is
conceited
can
be
convinced
of
the
don
t
say
that
harry
that
is
to
deny
you
are
right
ethelwyn
the
moment
a
man
is
convinced
of
his
folly
he
ceases
to
be
a
fool
the
moment
a
man
is
convinced
of
his
conceit
he
ceases
to
be
conceited
but
there
be
a
final
judgment
and
the
true
man
will
welcome
it
even
if
he
is
to
appear
a
convicted
fool
a
man
s
business
is
to
see
first
that
he
is
not
acting
the
part
of
a

about
the
matter
to
take
heed
likewise
that
they
be
not
offering
to
pull
the
mote
out
of
their
brother

but
there
are
even
societies
established
and
supported
by
good
people
for
the
express
purpose
of
pulling
out
the
society
that
ought

with
a
certain
part
of
the
come
come
harry
you
are
absurd
such
people
don
t
come
near
they
can
t
touch
me
no
but
they
come
near
good
people
whom
i
know
brandishing
the
long
pins
with
which
they
pull
the
motes
out
and
threatening
them
with
judgment
before
their
time
they
are
but
pins
to
be
sure
not
but
you
have
wandered
harry
into
the
narrowest
underground
musty
ways
and
have
forgotten
all
about
the
cubicalness
of
you
are
right
my
love
as
you
generally
are
i
answered
laughing
look
at
that
great
antlered
elk
or
moose
fit
quarry
for
diana
of
the
silver
bow
look
how
it
glides
solemnly
away
into
the
unpastured
depths
of
the
aerial
deserts
look
again
at
that
reclining
giant
half
raised
upon
his
arm
with
his
face
turned
towards
the
wilderness
what
eyes
they
must
be
under
those
huge
brows
on
what
message
to
the
nations
is
he
borne
as
by
the
slow
sweep
of
ages
on
towards
his
mysterious
goal
stop
stop
harry
said
my
wife
it
makes
me
unhappy
to
hear
grand
words
clothing
only
cloudy
fancies
such
words
ought
to
be
used
about
the
truth
and
the
truth
if
i
could
carry
it
no
further
my
dear
then
it
would
indeed
be
a
degrading
of
words
but
there
never
was
a
vagary
that
uplifted
the
soul
or
made
the
grand
words
flow
from
the
gates
of
speech
that
had
not
its
counterpart
in
truth
itself
man
can
imagine
nothing
even
in
the
clouds
of
the
air
that
god
has
not
done
or
is
not
doing
even
as
that
cloudy
giant
yields
and
is
shepherded
by
the
slow
unwilling
wind
so
is
each
of
us
borne
onward
to
an
unseen
destiny
a
glorious
one
if
we
will
but
yield
to
the
spirit
of
god
that
bloweth
where
it
listeth
with
a
grand
listing
coming
whence
we
know
not
and
going
whither
we
know
not
the
very
clouds
of
the
air
are
hung
up
as
dim
pictures
of
the
thoughts
and
history
of
i
do
not
mind
how
long
you
talk
like
that
husband
even
if
you
take
the
clouds
for
your
text
but
it
did
make
me
miserable
to
think
that
what
you
were
saying
had
no
more
basis
than
the
fantastic
forms
which
the
clouds
assume
i
see
i
was
wrong
the
clouds
themselves
in
such
a
solemn
stately
march
as
this
used
to
make
me
sad
for
the
very
same
reason
i
used
to
think
what
is
it
all
for
they
are
but
vapours
blown
by
the
wind
they
come
nowhence
and
they
go
nowhither
but
now
i
see
them
and
all
things
as
ever
moving
symbols
of
the
motions
of
man
s
spirit
and
a
pause
followed
during
which
we
sat
and
watched
the
marvellous
depth
of
the
heavens
deep
as
i
do
not
think
i
ever
saw
them
before
or
since
covered
with
a
stately
procession
of
and
forms
great
sculpturesque
blocks
of
a
shattered
storm
the
icebergs
of
the
upper
sea
these
were
not
far
off
against
a
blue
background
but
floating
near
us
in
the
heart
of
a
space
gloriously
lighted
by
a
golden
rather
than
silvery
moon
at
length
my
wife
spoke
i
hope
percivale
is
out
she
said
how
he
must
be
enjoying
it
if
he
is
i
wonder
the
young
man
is
not
returning
to
his
professional
labours
i
said
few
artists
can
afford
such
long
holidays
as
he
is
he
is
laying
in
stock
though
i
suppose
answered
my
wife
i
doubt
that
my
dear
he
said
not
on
one
occasion
you
may
yes
i
remember
but
still
he
must
paint
better
the
more
familiar
he
gets
with
the
things
god
cares
to
doubtless
but
i
am
afraid
the
work
of
god
he
is
chiefly
studying
at
present
is
our
well
is
she
not
a
worthy
object
of
his
study
returned
ethelwyn
looking
up
in
my
face
with
an
arch
expression
doubtless
again
ethel
but
i
hope
she
is
not
studying
him
quite
so
much
in
her
turn
i
have
seen
her
eyes
following
him
my
wife
made
no
answer
for
a
moment
then
she
said
don
t
you
like
him
harry
yes
i
like
him
very
then
why
should
you
not
like
wynnie
to
like
him
i
should
like
to
be
surer
of
his
principles
for
one
i
should
like
to
be
surer
of
wynnie
i
was
silent
ethelwyn
resumed
don
t
you
think
they
might
do
each
other
good
still
i
could
not
reply
they
both
love
the
truth
i
am
sure
only
they
don
t
perhaps
know
what
it
is
yet
i
think
if
they
were
to
fall
in
love
with
each
other
it
would
very
likely
make
them
both
more
desirous
of
finding
it
perhaps
i
said
at
last
but
you
are
talking
about
awfully
serious
things
yes
as
serious
as
life
she
answered
you
make
me
very
anxious
i
said
the
young
man
has
not
i
fear
any
means
of
gaining
a
livelihood
for
more
than
why
should
he
before
he
wanted
it
i
like
to
see
a
man
who
can
be
content
with
an
art
and
a
living
by
i
hope
i
have
not
been
to
blame
in
allowing
them
to
see
so
much
of
each
other
i
said
hardly
heeding
my
wife
s
words
it
came
about
quite
naturally
she
rejoined
if
you
had
opposed
their
meeting
you
would
have
been
interfering
just
as
if
you
had
been
providence
and
you
would
have
only
made
them
think
more
about
each
he
hasn
t
said
anything
has
he
i
asked
in
positive
alarm
o
dear
no
it
may
be
all
my
fancy
i
am
only
looking
a
little
ahead
i
confess
i
should
like
him
for
a
i
approve
of
him
she
added
with
a
sweet
laugh
well
i
said
i
suppose
are
possible
however
disagreeable
results
of
having
i
tried
to
laugh
but
hardly
succeeded
harry
said
my
wife
i
don
t
like
you
in
such
a
mood
it
is
not
like
you
at
all
it
is
unworthy
of
how
can
i
help
being
anxious
when
you
speak
of
such
dreadful
things
as
the
possibility
of
having
to
give
away
my
daughter
my
precious
wonder
that
came
to
me
through
you
out
of
the
infinite
the
tender
little
darling
out
of
the
heart
of
god
you
used
to
say
henry
yes
and
with
a
destiny
he
had
ordained
it
is
strange
to
me
how
you
forget
your
best
and
noblest
teaching
sometimes
you
are
always
telling
us
to
trust
in
god
surely
it
is
a
poor
creed
that
will
only
allow
us
to
trust
in
god
for
ourselves
a
very
selfish
creed
there
must
be
something
wrong
there
i
should
say
that
the
man
who
can
only
trust
god
for
himself
is
not
half
a
christian
either
he
is
so
selfish
that
that
satisfies
him
or
he
has
such
a
poor
notion
of
god
that
he
can
not
trust
him
with
what
most
concerns
him
the
former
is
not
your
case
harry
is
the
latter
then
you
see
i
must
take
my
turn
at
the
preaching
sometimes
mayn
t
i
dearest
she
took
my
hand
in
both
of
hers
the
truth
arose
in
my
heart
i
never
loved
my
wife
more
than
at
that
moment
and
now
i
could
not
speak
for
other
reasons
i
saw
that
i
had
been
faithless
to
my
god
and
the
moment
i
could
command
my
speech
i
hastened
to
confess
it
you
are
right
my
dear
i
said
quite
right
i
have
been
wicked
for
i
have
been
denying
my
god
i
have
been
putting
my
providence
in
the
place
of
his
trying
like
an
anxious
fool
to
count
the
hairs
on
wynnie
s
head
instead
of
being
content
that
the
grand
loving
father
should
count
them
my
love
let
us
pray
for
wynnie
for
what
is
prayer
but
giving
her
to
god
and
his
holy
blessed
will
we
sat
hand
in
hand
neither
spoke
aloud
for
some
minutes
but
we
spoke
in
our
hearts
to
god
talking
to
him
about
wynnie
then
we
rose
together
and
walked
homeward
still
in
silence
but
my
heart
and
hand
clung
to
my
wife
as
to
the
angel
whom
god
had
sent
to
deliver
me
out
of
the
prison
of
my
faithlessness
and
as
we
went
lo
the
sky
was
glorious
again
it
had
faded
from
my
sight
had
grown
flat
as
a
dogma
uninteresting
as
a
foul
and
pestilent
congregation
of
vapours
the
moon
had
been
but
a
round
thing
with
the
sun
shining
upon
it
and
the
stars
were
only
minding
their
own
business
but
now
the
solemn
march
towards
an
unseen
unimagined
goal
had
again
begun
wynnie
s
life
was
hid
with
christ
in
god
away
strode
the
cloudy
pageant
with
its
banners
blowing
in
the
wind
which
blew
where
it
grandly
listed
marching
as
to
a
solemn
triumphal
music
that
drew
them
from
afar
towards
the
gates
of
pearl
by
which
the
morning
walks
out
of
the
new
jerusalem
to
gladden
the
nations
of
the
earth
solitary
stars
with
all
their
sparkles
drawn
in
shone
quiet
as
human
eyes
in
the
deep
solemn
clefts
of
dark
blue
air
they
looked
restrained
and
still
as
if
they
knew
all
about
it
all
about
the
secret
of
this
midnight
march
for
the
moon
she
saw
the
sun
and
therefore
made
the
earth
glad
you
have
been
a
moon
to
me
this
night
my
wife
i
said
you
were
looking
full
at
the
truth
while
i
was
dark
i
saw
its
light
in
your
face
and
believed
and
turned
my
soul
to
the
sun
and
now
i
am
both
ashamed
and
glad
god
keep
me
from
sinning
so
my
dear
husband
it
was
only
a
mood
a
passing
mood
said
ethelwyn
seeking
to
comfort
me
it
was
a
mood
and
thank
god
it
is
now
past
but
it
was
a
wicked
one
it
was
a
mood
in
which
the
lord
might
have
called
me
a
devil
as
he
did
peter
such
moods
have
to
be
grappled
with
and
fought
the
moment
they
appear
they
must
not
have
their
way
for
a
single
thought
but
we
can
t
help
it
always
can
we
husband
we
can
t
help
it
out
and
out
because
our
wills
are
not
yet
free
with
the
freedom
god
is
giving
us
as
fast
as
we
will
let
him
when
we
are
able
to
will
thoroughly
then
we
shall
do
what
we
will
at
least
i
think
we
shall
but
there
is
a
mystery
in
it
god
only
understands
all
we
know
is
that
we
can
struggle
and
pray
but
a
mood
is
an
awful
oppression
sometimes
when
you
least
believe
in
it
and
most
wish
to
get
rid
of
it
it
is
like
a
headache
in
the
what
do
the
people
do
that
don
t
believe
in
god
said
ethelwyn
the
same
moment
wynnie
who
had
seen
us
pass
the
window
opened
the
door
of
the
for
us
and
we
passed
into
connie
s
chamber
and
found
her
lying
in
the
moonlight
gazing
at
the
same
heavens
as
her
father
and
mother
had
been
revelling
in
chapter
ii
our
last
the
next
day
was
very
lovely
i
think
it
is
the
last
of
the
kind
of
which
i
shall
have
occasion
to
write
in
my
narrative
of
the
seaboard
parish
i
wonder
if
my
readers
are
tired
of
so
much
about
the
common
things
of
nature
i
reason
about
it
something
in
this
way
we
are
so
easily
affected
by
the
smallest
things
that
are
of
the
unpleasant
kind
that
we
ought
to
train
ourselves
to
the
influence
of
those
that
are
of
an
opposite
nature
the
unpleasant
ones
are
like
the
thorns
which
make
themselves
felt
as
we
scramble
for
we
often
do
scramble
in
a
very
undignified
manner
through
the
thickets
of
life
and
feeling
the
thorns
we
grumble
and
are
blind
to
all
but
the
thorns
the
flowers
and
the
lovely
leaves
and
the
red
berries
and
the
clusters
of
filberts
and
the
birds
do
not
force
themselves
upon
our
attention
as
the
thorns
do
and
the
thorns
make
us
forget
to
look
for
them
but
a
scratch
would
be
forgotten
and
that
in
mental
hurts
is
often
equivalent
to
a
cure
for
a
forgotten
scratch
on
the
mind
or
heart
will
never
fester
if
we
but
allowed
our
being
a
moment
s
repose
upon
any
of
the
quiet
waiting
unobtrusive
beauties
that
lie
around
the
way
offering
their
gentle
healing
and
when
i
think
how
not
unfrequently
otherwise
noble
characters
are
anything
but
admirable
when
under
the
influence
of
trifling
irritations
the
very
paltriness
of
which
seems
what
the
mind
which
would
at
once
rouse
itself
to
a
noble
endurance
of
any
mighty
evil
is
unable
to
endure
i
would
gladly
help
so
with
sweet
antidotes
to
defeat
the
fly
in
the
ointment
of
the
apothecary
that
the
whole
pot
shall
send
forth
a
pure
savour
we
ought
for
this
to
cultivate
the
friendships
of
little
things
beauty
is
one
of
the
surest
antidotes
to
vexation
often
when
life
looked
dreary
about
me
from
some
real
or
fancied
injustice
or
indignity
has
a
thought
of
truth
been
flashed
into
my
mind
from
a
flower
a
shape
of
frost
or
even
a
lingering
shadow
not
to
mention
such
glories
as
clouds
rainbows
stars
and
sunrises
therefore
i
hope
that
in
my
loving
delay
over
such
aspects
of
nature
as
impressed
themselves
upon
me
in
this
most
memorable
part
of
my
history
i
shall
not
prove
wearisome
to
my
reader
for
therein
i
should
utterly
contravene
my
hope
and
intent
in
the
recording
of
them
this
day
there
was
to
be
an
unusually
low
tide
and
we
had
reckoned
on
enlarging
our
acquaintance
with
the
bed
of
the
ocean
of
knowing
a
few
yards
more
of
the
millions
of
miles
lapt
in
the
mystery
of
waters
it
was
to
be
low
water
about
two
o
clock
and
we
resolved
to
dine
upon
the
sands
but
all
the
morning
the
children
were
out
playing
on
the
threshold
of
old
neptune
s
palace
for
in
his
quieter
mood
he
will
like
a
fierce
mastiff
let
children
do
with
him
what
they
will
i
gave
myself
a
whole
holiday
sometimes
the
most
precious
part
of
my
life
both
for
myself
and
those
for
whom
i
labour
and
wandered
about
on
the
shore
now
passing
the
children
and
assailed
with
a
volley
of
cries
and
entreaties
to
look
at
this
one
s
castle
and
that
one
s
ditch
now
leaving
them
behind
with
what
in
its
ungraduated
flatness
might
well
enough
personate
an
endless
desert
of
sand
between
over
the
expanse
of
which
i
could
imagine
them
disappearing
on
a
far
horizon
whence
however
a
faint
occasional
cry
of
excitement
and
pleasure
would
reach
my
ears
the
sea
was
so
calm
and
the
shore
so
gently
sloping
that
you
could
hardly
tell
where
the
sand
ceased
and
the
sea
began
the
water
sloped
to
such
a
thin
pellicle
thinner
than
any
upon
the
shining
brown
sand
and
you
saw
the
sand
underneath
the
water
to
such
a
distance
out
yet
this
depth
which
would
not
drown
a
red
spider
was
the
ocean
in
my
mind
i
followed
that
bed
of
shining
sand
bared
of
its
hiding
waters
out
and
out
till
i
was
lost
in
an
awful
wilderness
of
chasms
precipices
and
in
whose
caverns
the
may
dwell
with
his
breath
of
pestilence
the
kraken
with
his
skaly
rind
may
there
be
sleeping
his
ancient
dreamless
uninvaded
sleep
while
faintest
sunlights
flee
about
his
shadowy
sides
as
he
lies
battening
upon
huge
seaworms
in
his
there
may
lie
all
the
horrors
that
schiller
s
diver
encountered
the
frightful
molch
and
that
worst
of
all
to
which
he
gives
no
name
which
came
creeping
with
a
hundred
knots
at
once
but
here
are
only
the
gracious
shells
an
evanescent
jelly
or
two
and
the
queer
that
crawl
out
from
the
holes
of
the
bordering
rocks
what
awful
gradations
of
gentleness
lead
from
such
as
these
down
to
those
cabins
where
wallow
the
inventions
of
nature
s
infancy
when
like
a
child
of
untutored
imagination
she
drew
on
the
slate
of
her
fancy
creations
in
which
flitting
shadows
of
beauty
serve
only
to
heighten
the
shuddering
gruesome
horror
the
sweet
sun
and
air
the
hand
of
man
and
the
growth
of
the
ages
have
all
but
swept
such
from
the
upper
plains
of
the
earth
what
hunter
s
bow
has
twanged
what
adventurer
s
rifle
has
cracked
in
those
leagues
of
vaster
than
all
the
upper
world
can
show
where
the
beasts
of
the
ocean
graze
the
their
pasture
diana
of
the
silver
bow
herself
when
she
descends
into
the
interlunar
caves
of
hell
sends
no
such
monsters
fleeing
from
her
spells
yet
if
such
there
be
such
horrors
too
must
lie
in
the
undiscovered
caves
of
man
s
nature
of
which
all
this
outer
world
is
but
a
typical
analysis
by
equally
slow
gradations
may
the
inner
eye
descend
from
the
truth
of
a
cordelia
to
the
falsehood
of
an
iago
as
these
golden
sands
slope
from
the
sunlight
into
the
wallowing
abyss
of
darkness
even
so
from
the
love
of
the
child
to
his
holy
mother
slopes
the
inclined
plane
of
humanity
to
the
hell
of
the
sensualist
but
with
one
difference
in
the
moral
world
i
said
aloud
as
i
paced
up
and
down
on
the
shimmering
margin
that
everywhere
in
the
scale
the
eye
of
the
father
can
detect
the
first
quiver
of
the
eyelid
that
would
raise
itself
heavenward
responsive
to
his
waking
i
lifted
my
eyes
in
the
relief
of
the
thought
and
saw
how
the
sun
of
the
autumn
hung
above
the
waters
oppressed
with
a
mist
of
his
own
glory
far
away
to
the
left
a
man
who
had
been
clambering
on
a
low
rock
inaccessible
save
in
such
a
tide
gathering
mussels
threw
himself
into
the
sea
and
swam
ashore
above
his
head
the
stood
in
the
stormless
air
the
sea
glittered
and
shone
and
the
birds
knew
not
which
to
choose
the
balmy
air
or
the
cool
deep
now
flitting
like
through
the
one
now
alighting
eagerly
upon
the
other
to
forsake
it
anew
for
the
thinner
element
i
thanked
god
for
his
glory
o
papa
it
s
so
jolly
so
jolly
shouted
the
children
as
i
passed
them
again
what
is
it
that
s
so
jolly
charlie
i
asked
my
castle
screeched
harry
in
reply
only
it
s
tumbled
down
the
water
keep
coming
in
i
tried
to
stop
it
with
a
newspaper
cried
charlie
but
it
wouldn
t
so
we
were
forced
to
let
it
be
and
down
it
went
into
the
we
blew
it
up
rather
than
surrender
said
dora
we
did
only
harry
always
forgets
and
says
it
was
the
water
did
i
drew
near
the
rock
that
held
the
bath
i
had
never
approached
it
from
this
side
before
it
was
high
above
my
head
and
a
stream
of
water
was
flowing
from
it
i
scrambled
up
undressed
and
plunged
into
its
dark
hollow
where
i
felt
like
one
of
the
of
which
i
had
been
dreaming
down
in
the
caves
of
the
unvisited
ocean
but
the
sun
was
over
my
head
and
the
air
with
an
edge
of
the
winter
was
about
me
i
dressed
quickly
descended
on
the
other
side
of
the
rock
and
wandered
again
on
the
sands
to
seaward
of
the
breakwater
which
lay
above
looking
dry
and
weary
and
worn
with
years
of
contest
with
the
waves
which
had
at
length
withdrawn
defeated
to
their
own
country
and
left
it
as
if
to
victory
and
a
useless
age
of
peace
how
different
was
the
scene
when
a
raving
mountain
of
water
filled
all
the
hollow
where
i
now
wandered
and
rushed
over
the
top
of
that
mole
now
so
high
above
me
and
i
had
to
cling
to
its
stones
to
keep
me
from
being
carried
off
like
a
bit
of
floating
this
was
the
loveliest
and
strangest
part
of
the
shore
several
long
low
ridges
of
rock
of
whose
existence
i
scarcely
knew
worn
to
a
level
with
the
sand
hollowed
and
channelled
with
the
terrible
run
of
the
tide
across
them
and
looking
like
the
old
and
outworn
of
some
awful
beast
of
prey
stretched
out
seawards
here
and
there
amongst
them
rose
a
rock
but
now
so
changed
in
look
by
being
lifted
all
the
height
between
the
base
on
the
waters
and
the
second
base
in
the
sand
that
i
wondered
at
each
walking
round
and
viewing
it
on
all
sides
it
seemed
almost
a
fresh
growth
out
of
the
garden
of
the
shore
with
uncouth
hollows
around
its
fungous
root
and
a
forsaken
air
about
its
brows
as
it
stood
in
the
dry
sand
and
looked
seaward
but
what
made
the
chief
delight
of
the
spot
closed
in
by
rocks
from
the
open
sands
was
the
multitude
of
fairy
rivers
that
flowed
across
it
to
the
sea
the
gladness
these
streams
gave
me
i
can
not
communicate
the
tide
had
filled
thousands
of
hollows
in
the
breakwater
hundreds
of
cracked
basins
in
the
rocks
huge
sponges
of
sand
from
all
of
which
from
cranny
and
crack
and
oozing
sponge
the
water
flowed
in
restricted
haste
back
back
to
the
sea
tumbling
in
tiny
cataracts
down
the
faces
of
the
rocks
bubbling
from
their
roots
as
from
wells
gathering
in
tanks
of
sand
and
overflowing
in
broad
shallow
streams
curving
and
sweeping
in
their
sandy
channels
just
like
the
great
rivers
of
a
continent
here
spreading
into
smooth
silent
lakes
and
reaches
here
babbling
along
in
ripples
and
waves
innumerable
flowing
flowing
to
lose
their
small
beings
in
the
same
ocean
that
met
on
the
other
side
the
waters
of
the
mississippi
the
orinoco
the
amazon
all
their
channels
were
of
golden
sand
and
the
golden
sunlight
was
above
and
through
and
in
them
all
gold
and
gold
met
with
the
waters
between
and
what
gave
an
added
life
to
their
motion
was
that
all
the
ripples
made
shadows
on
the
clear
yellow
below
them
the
eye
could
not
see
the
rippling
on
the
surface
but
the
sun
saw
it
and
drew
it
in
multitudinous
shadowy
motion
upon
the
sand
with
the
play
of
a
thousand
fancies
of
gold
burnished
and
dead
of
sunlight
and
yellow
trembling
melting
curving
blending
vanishing
ever
ever
renewed
it
was
as
if
all
the
upon
a
web
of
golden
silk
had
been
set
in
wildest
yet
most
graceful
curvilinear
motion
by
the
breath
of
a
hundred
playful
zephyrs
my
eye
could
not
be
filled
with
seeing
i
stood
in
speechless
delight
for
a
while
gazing
at
the
endless
ending
which
was
the
humour
of
the
game
and
thinking
how
in
all
god
s
works
the
laws
of
beauty
are
wrought
out
in
evanishment
in
birth
and
death
there
there
is
no
hoarding
but
an
creating
an
eternal
flow
of
life
from
the
heart
of
the
hence
even
the
heart
of
man
can
not
hoard
his
brain
or
his
hand
may
gather
into
its
box
and
hoard
but
the
moment
the
thing
has
passed
into
the
box
the
heart
has
lost
it
and
is
hungry
again
if
man
would
it
is
the
giver
he
must
have
the
eternal
the
original
the
is
alone
within
his
reach
the
everlasting
is
his
heritage
therefore
all
that
he
makes
must
be
free
to
come
and
go
through
the
heart
of
his
child
he
can
enjoy
it
only
as
it
passes
can
enjoy
only
its
life
its
soul
its
vision
its
meaning
not
itself
to
hoard
rubies
and
sapphires
is
as
useless
and
hopeless
for
the
heart
as
if
i
were
to
attempt
to
hoard
this
marvel
of
sand
and
water
and
sunlight
in
the
same
iron
chest
with
the
musty
deeds
of
my
wife
s
inheritance
father
i
murmured
half
aloud
thou
alone
art
and
i
am
because
thou
art
thy
will
shall
be
i
know
that
i
must
have
spoken
aloud
because
i
remember
the
start
of
consciousness
and
discomposure
occasioned
by
the
voice
of
percivale
greeting
me
i
beg
your
pardon
he
added
i
did
not
mean
to
startle
you
walton
i
thought
you
were
only
looking
at
nature
s
childplay
not
i
know
few
things
fit
to
set
one
thinking
than
what
you
have
very
well
called
nature
s
childplay
i
returned
is
nature
very
heartless
now
do
you
think
to
go
on
with
this
kind
of
thing
at
our
feet
when
away
up
yonder
lies
the
awful
london
with
so
many
sores
festering
in
her
heart
you
must
answer
your
own
question
walton
you
know
i
can
not
i
confess
i
feel
the
difficulty
deeply
i
will
go
further
and
confess
that
the
discrepancy
makes
me
doubt
many
things
i
would
gladly
believe
i
know
are
able
to
distinguish
between
a
glad
unbelief
and
a
sorrowful
else
were
i
unworthy
of
the
humblest
place
in
the
kingdom
unworthy
to
be
a
doorkeeper
in
the
house
of
my
god
i
answered
and
recoiled
from
the
sound
of
my
own
words
for
they
seemed
to
imply
that
i
believed
myself
worthy
of
the
position
i
occupied
i
hastened
to
correct
them
but
do
not
mistake
my
thoughts
i
said
i
do
not
dream
of
worthiness
in
the
way
of
honour
only
of
fitness
for
the
work
to
be
done
for
that
i
think
god
has
fitted
me
in
some
measure
the
doorkeeper
s
office
may
be
given
him
not
because
he
has
done
some
great
deed
worthy
of
the
honour
but
because
he
can
sweep
the
porch
and
scour
the
threshold
and
will
in
the
main
try
to
keep
them
clean
that
is
all
the
worthiness
i
dare
to
claim
even
to
hope
that
i
no
one
who
knows
you
can
mistake
your
words
except
wilfully
returned
percivale
courteously
thank
you
i
said
now
i
will
just
ask
you
in
reference
to
the
contrast
between
human
life
and
nature
how
you
will
go
back
to
your
work
in
london
after
seeing
all
this
child
s
and
other
play
of
nature
suppose
you
had
had
nothing
here
but
rain
and
high
winds
and
would
you
have
been
better
fitted
for
doing
something
to
comfort
those
who
know
nothing
of
such
influences
than
you
will
be
now
one
of
the
most
important
qualifications
of
a
is
a
ready
smile
a
nurse
in
a
sickroom
is
a
visible
embodiment
and
presence
of
the
disease
against
which
the
eager
life
of
the
patient
is
fighting
in
agony
such
ought
to
be
banished
with
their
black
dresses
and
their
looks
from
every
and
permitted
to
minister
only
to
the
dead
who
do
not
mind
looks
with
what
a
power
of
life
and
hope
does
a
woman
young
or
old
i
do
not
care
with
a
face
of
the
morning
a
dress
like
the
spring
a
bunch
of
wild
flowers
in
her
hand
with
the
dew
upon
them
and
perhaps
in
her
eyes
too
i
don
t
object
to
that
that
is
sympathy
not
the
worship
of
darkness
with
what
a
message
from
nature
and
life
does
she
looking
death
in
the
face
with
a
smile
dawn
upon
the
vision
of
the
invalid
she
brings
a
little
health
a
little
strength
to
fight
a
little
hope
to
endure
actually
lapt
in
the
folds
of
her
gracious
garments
for
the
soul
itself
can
do
more
than
any
medicine
if
it
be
fed
with
the
truth
of
but
are
you
not
i
beg
your
pardon
for
interposing
on
your
eloquence
with
dull
objection
said
percivale
are
you
not
begging
all
the
question
life
such
an
affair
of
sunshine
and
gladness
if
life
is
not
then
i
confess
all
this
show
of
nature
is
worse
than
vanity
it
is
a
vile
mockery
life
is
gladness
it
is
the
death
in
it
that
makes
the
misery
we
call
life
and
hence
the
mistake
if
gladness
were
not
at
the
root
whence
its
opposite
sorrow
against
which
we
arise
from
which
we
recoil
with
which
we
fight
we
recognise
it
as
death
the
contrary
of
life
there
could
be
no
sorrow
but
for
a
recognition
of
primordial
bliss
this
in
us
that
fights
must
be
life
it
is
of
the
nature
of
light
not
of
darkness
darkness
is
nothing
until
the
light
comes
this
very
childplay
as
you
call
it
of
nature
is
her
assertion
of
the
secret
that
life
is
the
deepest
that
life
shall
conquer
death
those
who
believe
this
must
bear
the
good
news
to
them
that
sit
in
darkness
and
the
shadow
of
death
our
lord
has
conquered
death
yea
the
moral
death
that
he
called
the
world
and
now
having
sown
the
seed
of
light
the
harvest
is
springing
in
human
hearts
is
springing
in
this
dance
of
radiance
and
will
grow
and
grow
until
the
hearts
of
the
children
of
the
kingdom
shall
frolic
in
the
sunlight
of
the
father
s
presence
nature
has
god
at
her
heart
she
is
but
the
garment
of
the
invisible
god
wears
his
singing
robes
in
a
day
like
this
and
says
to
his
children
be
not
afraid
your
brothers
and
sisters
up
there
in
london
are
in
my
hands
go
and
help
them
i
am
with
you
bear
to
them
the
message
of
joy
tell
them
to
be
of
good
cheer
i
have
overcome
the
world
tell
them
to
endure
hunger
and
not
sin
to
endure
passion
and
not
yield
to
admire
and
not
desire
sorrow
and
pain
are
serving
my
ends
for
by
them
will
i
slay
sin
and
save
my
i
wish
i
could
believe
as
you
do
i
wish
you
could
but
god
will
teach
you
if
you
are
willing
to
be
i
desire
the
truth
god
bless
you
god
is
blessing
you
i
said
amen
returned
percivale
devoutly
and
we
strolled
away
together
in
silence
towards
the
cliffs
the
recession
of
the
tide
allowed
us
to
get
far
enough
away
from
the
face
of
the
rocks
to
see
the
general
effect
with
the
lisping
of
the
wavelets
at
our
heels
we
stood
and
regarded
the
worn
yet
defiant
the
wasted
and
jagged
yet
reposeful
face
of
the
guardians
of
the
shore
who
could
imagine
in
weather
like
this
and
with
this
baby
of
a
tide
lying
behind
us
low
at
our
feet
and
shallow
as
the
water
a
schoolboy
pours
upon
his
slate
to
wash
it
withal
that
those
grand
cliffs
before
us
bear
on
their
front
the
scars
and
dints
of
centuries
of
chiliads
of
stubborn
resistance
of
passionate
contest
with
this
same
creature
that
is
at
this
moment
unable
to
rock
the
cradle
of
an
infant
look
behind
you
at
your
feet
percivale
look
before
you
at
the
chasms
rents
caves
and
hollows
of
those
i
wish
you
were
a
painter
walton
he
said
i
wish
i
were
i
returned
at
least
i
know
i
should
rejoice
in
it
if
it
had
been
given
me
to
be
one
but
why
do
you
say
so
now
because
you
have
always
some
individual
predominating
idea
which
would
give
interpretation
to
nature
while
it
gave
harmony
reality
and
individuality
to
your
representation
of
i
know
what
you
mean
i
answered
but
i
have
no
gift
whatever
in
that
direction
i
have
no
idea
of
drawing
or
of
producing
the
effects
of
light
and
shade
though
i
think
i
have
a
little
notion
of
colour
perhaps
about
as
much
as
the
little
london
boy
who
stopped
a
friend
of
mine
once
to
ask
the
way
to
the
field
where
the
buttercups
grew
had
of
i
wish
i
could
ask
your
opinion
of
some
of
my
that
i
should
never
presume
to
give
i
could
only
tell
you
what
they
made
me
feel
or
perhaps
only
think
some
day
i
may
have
the
pleasure
of
looking
at
may
i
offer
you
my
address
he
said
and
took
a
card
from
his
it
is
a
poor
place
but
if
you
should
happen
to
think
of
me
when
you
are
next
in
london
i
shall
be
honoured
by
your
paying
me
a
i
shall
be
most
happy
i
returned
taking
his
did
it
ever
occur
to
you
in
reference
to
the
subject
we
were
upon
a
few
minutes
ago
how
little
you
can
do
without
shadow
in
making
a
picture
little
indeed
answered
percivale
in
fact
it
would
be
no
picture
at
i
doubt
if
the
world
would
fare
better
without
its
but
it
would
be
a
poor
satisfaction
with
regard
to
the
nature
of
god
to
be
told
that
he
allowed
evil
for
artistic
it
would
indeed
if
you
regard
the
world
as
a
picture
but
if
you
think
of
his
art
as
expended
not
upon
the
making
of
a
history
or
a
drama
but
upon
the
making
of
an
individual
a
being
a
character
then
i
think
a
great
part
of
the
difficulty
concerning
the
existence
of
evil
which
oppresses
you
will
vanish
so
long
as
a
creature
has
not
sinned
sin
is
possible
to
him
does
it
seem
inconsistent
with
the
character
of
god
that
in
order
that
sin
should
become
impossible
he
should
allow
sin
to
come
that
in
order
that
his
creatures
should
choose
the
good
and
refuse
the
evil
in
order
that
they
might
become
such
with
their
whole
nature
infinitely
enlarged
as
to
turn
from
sin
with
a
perfect
repugnance
of
the
will
he
should
allow
them
to
fall
that
in
order
that
from
being
sweet
childish
children
they
should
become
noble
men
and
women
he
should
let
them
try
to
walk
alone
why
should
he
not
allow
the
possible
in
order
that
it
should
become
impossible
for
possible
it
would
ever
have
been
even
in
the
midst
of
all
the
blessedness
until
it
had
been
and
had
been
thus
destroyed
thus
sin
is
slain
uprooted
and
the
war
must
ever
exist
it
seems
to
me
where
there
is
creation
still
going
on
how
could
i
be
content
to
guard
my
children
so
that
they
should
never
have
temptation
knowing
that
in
all
probability
they
would
fail
if
at
any
moment
it
should
cross
their
path
would
the
deepest
communion
of
father
and
child
ever
be
possible
between
us
evil
would
ever
seem
to
be
in
the
child
so
long
as
it
was
possible
it
should
be
there
developed
and
if
this
can
be
said
for
the
existence
of
moral
evil
the
existence
of
all
other
evil
becomes
a
comparative
trifle
nay
a
positive
good
for
by
this
the
other
is
i
think
i
understand
you
returned
percivale
i
will
think
over
what
you
have
said
these
are
very
difficult
very
i
don
t
think
argument
is
of
much
use
about
them
except
as
it
may
help
to
quiet
a
man
s
uneasiness
a
little
and
so
give
his
mind
peace
to
think
about
duty
for
about
the
doing
of
duty
there
can
be
no
question
once
it
is
seen
and
the
doing
of
duty
is
the
shortest
in
very
fact
the
only
way
into
the
as
we
spoke
we
had
turned
from
the
cliffs
and
wandered
back
across
the
salt
streams
to
the
sands
beyond
from
the
direction
of
the
house
came
a
little
procession
of
servants
with
walter
at
their
head
bearing
the
preparations
for
our
dinner
over
the
gates
of
the
lock
down
the
sides
of
the
embankment
of
the
canal
and
across
the
sands
in
the
direction
of
the
children
who
were
still
playing
merrily
will
you
join
our
early
dinner
which
is
to
be
out
of
doors
as
you
see
somewhere
hereabout
on
the
sands
i
said
i
shall
be
delighted
he
answered
if
you
will
let
me
be
of
some
use
first
i
presume
you
mean
to
bring
your
invalid
yes
and
you
shall
help
me
to
carry
her
if
you
that
is
what
i
hoped
said
percivale
and
we
went
together
towards
the
parsonage
as
we
approached
i
saw
wynnie
sitting
at
the
window
but
when
we
entered
the
room
she
was
gone
my
wife
was
there
however
where
is
wynnie
i
asked
she
saw
you
coming
she
answered
and
went
to
get
connie
ready
for
i
guessed
percivale
had
come
to
help
you
to
carry
her
but
i
could
not
help
doubting
there
might
be
more
than
that
in
wynnie
s
disappearance
what
if
she
should
have
fallen
in
love
with
him
i
thought
and
he
should
never
say
a
word
on
the
subject
that
would
be
dreadful
for
us
they
had
been
repeatedly
but
not
very
much
together
of
late
and
i
was
compelled
to
allow
to
myself
that
if
they
did
fall
in
love
with
each
other
it
would
be
very
natural
on
both
sides
for
there
was
evidently
a
great
mental
resemblance
between
them
so
that
they
could
not
help
sympathising
with
each
other
s
peculiarities
and
anyone
could
see
what
a
fine
couple
they
would
make
wynnie
was
much
taller
than
connie
almost
the
height
of
her
mother
she
had
a
very
fair
skin
and
brown
hair
a
broad
forehead
a
wise
thoughtful
often
troubled
face
a
mouth
that
seldom
smiled
but
on
which
a
smile
seemed
always
asleep
and
round
soft
cheeks
that
dimpled
like
water
when
she
did
smile
i
have
described
percivale
before
why
should
not
two
such
walk
together
along
the
path
to
the
gates
of
the
light
and
yet
i
could
not
help
some
anxiety
i
did
not
know
anything
of
his
history
i
had
no
testimony
concerning
him
from
anyone
that
knew
him
his
past
life
was
a
blank
to
me
his
means
of
livelihood
probably
insufficient
certainly
i
judged
precarious
and
his
position
in
society
but
there
i
checked
myself
i
had
had
enough
of
that
kind
of
thing
already
i
would
not
willingly
offend
in
that
worldliness
again
the
god
of
the
whole
earth
could
not
choose
that
i
should
look
at
such
works
of
his
hands
after
that
fashion
and
i
was
his
servant
not
mammon
s
or
belial
s
all
this
passed
through
my
mind
in
about
three
turns
of
the
of
thought
percivale
had
begun
talking
to
my
wife
who
took
no
pains
to
conceal
that
his
presence
was
pleasant
to
her
and
i
went
upstairs
almost
unconsciously
to
connie
s
room
when
i
opened
the
door
forgetting
to
announce
my
approach
as
i
ought
to
have
done
i
saw
wynnie
leaning
over
connie
and
connie
s
arm
round
her
waist
wynnie
started
back
and
connie
gave
a
little
cry
for
the
jerk
thus
occasioned
had
hurt
her
wynnie
had
turned
her
head
away
but
turned
it
again
at
connie
s
cry
and
i
saw
a
tear
on
her
face
my
darlings
i
beg
your
pardon
i
said
it
was
very
stupid
of
me
not
to
knock
at
the
connie
looked
up
at
me
with
large
resting
eyes
and
said
it
s
nothing
papa
wynnie
is
in
one
of
her
gloomy
moods
and
didn
t
want
you
to
see
her
crying
she
gave
me
a
little
pull
that
was
all
it
didn
t
hurt
me
much
only
i
m
such
a
goose
i
m
in
terror
before
the
pain
comes
look
at
me
she
added
seeing
doubtless
some
perturbation
on
my
countenance
i
m
all
right
and
she
smiled
in
my
face
perfectly
i
turned
to
wynnie
put
my
arm
about
her
kissed
her
cheek
and
left
the
room
i
looked
round
at
the
door
and
saw
that
connie
was
following
me
with
her
eyes
but
wynnie
s
were
hidden
in
her
handkerchief
i
went
back
to
the
and
in
a
few
minutes
walter
came
to
announce
that
dinner
was
about
to
be
served
the
same
moment
wynnie
came
to
say
that
connie
was
ready
she
did
not
lift
her
eyes
or
approach
to
give
percivale
any
greeting
but
went
again
as
soon
as
she
had
given
her
message
i
saw
that
he
looked
first
concerned
and
then
thoughtful
come
percivale
i
said
and
he
followed
me
up
to
connie
s
room
wynnie
was
not
there
but
connie
lay
looking
lovely
all
ready
for
going
we
lifted
her
and
carried
her
by
the
window
out
on
the
down
for
the
easiest
way
though
the
longest
was
by
the
path
to
the
breakwater
along
its
broad
back
and
down
from
the
end
of
it
upon
the
sands
before
we
reached
the
breakwater
i
found
that
wynnie
was
following
behind
us
we
stopped
in
the
middle
of
it
and
set
connie
down
as
if
i
wanted
to
take
breath
but
i
had
thought
of
something
to
say
to
her
which
i
wanted
wynnie
to
hear
without
its
being
addressed
to
her
do
you
see
connie
i
said
how
far
off
the
water
is
yes
papa
it
is
a
long
way
off
i
wish
i
could
get
up
and
run
down
to
you
can
hardly
believe
that
all
between
all
those
rocks
and
all
that
sand
will
be
covered
before
i
know
it
will
be
but
it
doesn
t
likely
does
it
papa
not
the
least
likely
my
dear
do
you
remember
that
stormy
night
when
i
came
through
your
room
to
go
out
for
a
walk
in
the
dark
remember
it
papa
i
can
not
forget
it
every
time
i
hear
the
wind
blowing
when
i
wake
in
the
night
i
fancy
you
are
out
in
it
and
have
to
wake
myself
up
quite
to
get
rid
of
the
well
connie
look
down
into
the
great
hollow
there
with
rocks
and
sand
at
the
bottom
of
it
stretching
far
yes
now
look
over
the
side
of
your
litter
you
see
those
holes
all
about
between
the
stones
yes
well
one
of
those
little
holes
saved
my
life
that
night
when
the
great
gulf
there
was
full
of
huge
mounds
of
roaring
water
which
rushed
across
this
breakwater
with
force
enough
to
sweep
a
whole
cavalry
regiment
off
its
papa
exclaimed
connie
turning
pale
then
first
i
told
her
all
the
story
and
wynnie
listened
behind
then
i
right
in
being
frightened
papa
cried
connie
bursting
into
tears
for
since
her
accident
she
could
not
well
command
her
feelings
you
were
right
in
trusting
in
god
but
you
might
have
been
drowned
papa
she
sobbed
nobody
has
a
right
to
say
that
anything
might
have
been
other
than
what
has
been
before
a
thing
has
happened
we
can
say
might
or
might
not
but
that
has
to
do
only
with
our
ignorance
of
course
i
am
not
speaking
of
things
wherein
we
ought
to
exercise
will
and
choice
that
is
department
but
this
does
not
look
like
that
now
does
it
think
what
a
change
from
the
dark
night
and
the
roaring
water
to
this
fulness
of
sunlight
and
the
bare
sands
with
the
water
lisping
on
their
edge
away
there
in
the
distance
now
i
want
you
to
think
that
in
life
troubles
will
come
which
look
as
if
they
would
never
pass
away
the
night
and
the
storm
look
as
if
they
would
last
for
ever
but
the
calm
and
the
morning
can
not
be
stayed
the
storm
in
its
very
nature
is
transient
the
effort
of
nature
as
that
of
the
human
heart
ever
is
to
return
to
its
repose
for
god
is
but
if
you
will
excuse
me
walton
said
percivale
you
can
hardly
expect
experience
to
be
of
use
to
any
but
those
who
have
had
it
it
seems
to
me
that
its
influences
can
not
be
that
depends
on
the
amount
of
faith
in
those
to
whom
its
results
are
offered
of
course
as
experience
it
can
have
no
weight
with
another
for
it
is
no
longer
experience
one
remove
and
it
ceases
but
faith
in
the
person
who
has
experienced
can
draw
over
or
derive
to
use
an
old
italian
word
some
of
its
benefits
to
him
who
has
the
faith
experience
may
thus
in
a
sense
be
accumulated
and
we
may
go
on
to
fresh
experience
of
our
own
at
least
i
can
hope
that
the
experience
of
a
father
may
take
the
form
of
hope
in
the
minds
of
his
daughters
hope
never
hurt
anyone
never
yet
interfered
with
duty
nay
always
strengthens
to
the
performance
of
duty
gives
courage
and
clears
the
judgment
paul
says
we
are
saved
by
hope
hope
is
the
most
rational
thing
in
the
universe
even
the
ancient
poets
who
believed
it
was
delusive
yet
regarded
it
as
an
antidote
given
by
the
mercy
of
the
gods
against
some
at
least
of
the
ills
of
but
they
counted
it
delusive
a
wise
man
can
not
consent
to
be
assuredly
not
the
sorest
truth
rather
than
a
false
hope
but
what
is
a
false
hope
only
one
that
ought
not
to
be
fulfilled
the
old
poets
could
give
themselves
little
room
for
hope
and
less
for
its
fulfilment
for
what
were
the
gods
in
whom
they
believed
i
can
not
say
in
whom
they
trusted
gods
who
did
the
best
their
own
poverty
of
being
was
capable
of
doing
for
men
when
they
gave
them
the
of
hope
but
i
see
they
are
waiting
for
us
below
one
thing
i
repeat
the
waves
that
foamed
across
the
spot
where
we
now
stand
are
gone
away
have
sunk
and
but
they
will
come
again
papa
faltered
wynnie
and
god
will
come
with
them
my
love
i
said
as
we
lifted
the
litter
in
a
few
minutes
more
we
were
all
seated
on
the
sand
around
a
spread
upon
it
i
shall
never
forgot
the
peace
and
the
light
outside
and
in
as
far
as
i
was
concerned
at
least
and
i
hope
the
others
too
that
afternoon
the
tide
had
turned
and
the
waves
were
creeping
up
over
the
level
soundless
almost
as
thought
but
it
would
be
time
to
go
home
long
before
they
had
reached
us
the
sun
was
in
the
western
half
of
the
sky
and
now
and
then
a
breath
of
wind
came
from
the
sea
with
a
slight
in
it
but
not
enough
to
hurt
connie
could
stand
much
more
in
that
way
now
and
when
i
saw
how
she
could
move
herself
on
her
couch
and
thought
how
much
she
had
improved
since
first
she
was
laid
upon
it
hope
for
her
kept
fluttering
joyously
in
my
heart
i
could
not
help
fancying
even
that
i
saw
her
move
her
legs
a
little
but
i
could
not
be
in
the
least
sure
and
she
if
she
did
move
them
was
clearly
unconscious
of
it
charles
and
harry
were
every
now
and
then
starting
up
from
their
dinner
and
running
off
with
a
shout
to
return
with
apparently
increased
appetite
for
the
rest
of
it
and
neither
their
mother
nor
i
cared
to
interfere
with
the
indecorum
dora
alone
took
it
upon
her
to
rebuke
them
wynnie
was
very
silent
but
looked
more
cheerful
connie
seemed
full
of
quiet
bliss
my
wife
s
face
was
a
picture
of
heavenly
repose
the
old
nurse
was
walking
about
with
the
baby
occasionally
with
one
hand
helping
the
other
servants
to
wait
upon
us
they
too
seemed
to
have
a
share
in
the
gladness
of
the
hour
and
like
ariel
did
their
spiriting
gently
this
is
the
will
of
god
i
said
after
the
things
were
removed
and
we
had
sat
for
a
few
moments
in
silence
what
is
the
will
of
god
husband
asked
ethelwyn
why
this
my
love
i
answered
this
living
air
and
wind
and
sea
and
light
and
land
all
about
us
this
consenting
consorting
harmony
of
nature
that
mirrors
a
like
peace
in
our
souls
the
perfection
of
such
visions
the
gathering
of
them
all
in
one
was
is
i
should
say
in
the
face
of
christ
jesus
you
will
say
that
face
was
troubled
sometimes
yes
but
with
a
trouble
that
broke
not
the
music
but
deepened
the
harmony
when
he
wept
at
the
grave
of
lazarus
you
do
not
think
it
was
for
lazarus
himself
or
for
his
own
loss
of
him
that
he
wept
that
could
not
be
seeing
he
had
the
power
to
call
him
back
when
he
would
the
grief
was
for
the
poor
troubled
hearts
left
behind
to
whom
it
was
so
dreadful
because
they
had
not
faith
enough
in
his
father
the
god
of
life
and
love
who
was
looking
after
it
all
full
of
tenderness
and
grace
with
whom
lazarus
was
present
and
blessed
it
was
the
aching
loving
heart
of
humanity
for
which
he
wept
that
needed
god
so
awfully
and
could
not
yet
trust
in
him
their
brother
was
only
hidden
in
the
skirts
of
their
father
s
garment
but
they
could
not
believe
that
they
said
he
was
dead
lost
away
all
gone
as
the
children
say
and
it
was
so
sad
to
think
of
a
whole
world
full
of
the
grief
of
death
that
he
could
not
bear
it
without
the
human
tears
to
help
his
heart
as
they
help
ours
it
was
for
our
dark
sorrows
that
he
wept
but
the
peace
could
be
no
less
plain
on
the
face
that
saw
god
did
you
ever
think
of
that
wonderful
saying
again
a
little
while
and
ye
shall
see
me
because
i
go
to
the
father
the
heart
of
man
would
have
joined
the
because
i
go
to
the
father
with
the
former
result
the
not
seeing
of
him
the
heart
of
man
is
not
able
without
more
and
more
light
to
understand
that
all
vision
is
in
the
light
of
the
father
because
jesus
went
to
the
father
therefore
the
disciples
saw
him
tenfold
more
his
body
no
longer
in
their
eyes
his
very
being
his
very
self
was
in
their
hearts
not
in
their
affections
only
in
their
spirits
their
heavenly
as
i
said
this
a
certain
hymn
for
which
i
had
and
have
an
especial
affection
came
into
my
mind
and
without
prologue
or
introduction
i
repeated
it
if
i
him
but
have
if
he
be
but
mine
if
my
heart
hence
to
the
grave
ne
er
forgets
his
love
divine
know
i
nought
of
sadness
feel
i
nought
but
worship
love
and
gladness
if
i
him
but
have
glad
with
all
i
part
follow
on
my
pilgrim
staff
my
lord
only
with
true
heart
leave
them
nothing
saying
on
broad
bright
and
crowded
highways
straying
if
i
him
but
have
glad
i
fall
asleep
aye
the
flood
that
his
heart
gave
strength
within
my
heart
shall
keep
and
with
soft
compelling
make
it
tender
through
and
through
it
swelling
if
i
him
but
have
mine
the
world
i
hail
glad
as
cherub
smiling
grave
holding
back
the
virgin
s
veil
sunk
and
lost
in
seeing
earthly
fears
have
died
from
all
my
being
where
i
have
but
him
is
my
fatherland
and
all
gifts
and
graces
come
heritage
into
my
hand
brothers
long
deplored
i
in
his
disciples
find
what
a
lovely
hymn
papa
exclaimed
connie
she
could
always
speak
more
easily
than
either
her
mother
or
sister
who
wrote
it
friedrich
von
hardenberg
known
where
he
is
known
as
but
he
must
have
written
it
in
german
did
you
translate
it
yes
you
will
find
i
think
that
i
have
kept
form
thought
and
feeling
however
i
may
have
failed
in
making
an
english
poem
of
o
you
dear
papa
it
is
lovely
is
it
long
since
you
did
it
years
before
you
were
born
to
think
of
you
having
lived
so
long
and
being
one
of
us
she
returned
was
he
a
roman
catholic
papa
no
he
was
a
moravian
at
least
his
parents
were
i
don
t
think
he
belonged
to
any
section
of
the
church
in
but
oughtn
t
he
papa
certainly
not
my
dear
except
he
saw
good
reason
for
it
but
what
is
the
use
of
asking
such
questions
after
a
hymn
like
that
o
i
didn
t
think
anything
bad
papa
i
assure
you
it
was
only
that
i
wanted
to
know
more
about
the
tears
were
in
her
eyes
and
i
was
sorry
i
had
treated
as
significant
what
was
really
not
so
but
the
constant
tendency
to
consider
christianity
as
associated
of
necessity
with
this
or
that
form
of
it
instead
of
as
simply
obedience
to
christ
had
grown
more
and
more
repulsive
to
me
as
i
had
grown
myself
for
it
always
seemed
like
an
insult
to
my
brethren
in
christ
hence
the
least
hint
of
it
in
my
children
i
was
too
ready
to
be
down
upon
like
a
most
unchristian
ogre
i
took
her
hand
in
mine
and
she
was
comforted
for
she
saw
in
my
face
that
i
was
sorry
and
yet
she
could
see
that
there
was
reason
at
the
root
of
my
haste
but
said
wynnie
who
i
thought
afterwards
must
have
strengthened
herself
to
speak
from
the
instinctive
desire
to
show
percivale
how
far
she
was
from
being
out
of
sympathy
with
what
he
might
suppose
formed
a
barrier
between
him
and
me
but
she
said
the
lovely
feeling
in
that
poem
seems
to
me
as
in
all
the
rest
of
such
poems
to
belong
only
to
the
new
testament
and
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
world
round
about
us
these
things
look
as
if
they
were
only
for
drawing
and
painting
and
being
glad
in
not
as
if
they
had
relations
with
all
those
awful
and
solemn
things
as
soon
as
i
try
to
get
the
two
together
i
lose
both
of
that
is
because
the
human
mind
must
begin
with
one
thing
and
grow
to
the
rest
at
first
christianity
seemed
to
men
to
have
only
to
do
with
their
conscience
that
was
the
first
relation
of
course
but
even
with
art
it
was
regarded
as
having
no
relation
except
for
the
presentment
of
its
history
afterwards
men
forgot
the
conscience
almost
in
trying
to
make
christianity
comprehensible
to
the
understanding
now
i
trust
we
are
beginning
to
see
that
christianity
is
everything
or
nothing
either
the
whole
is
a
lovely
fable
setting
forth
the
loftiest
longing
of
the
human
soul
after
the
vision
of
the
divine
or
it
is
such
a
fact
as
is
the
heart
not
only
of
theology
so
called
but
of
history
politics
science
and
art
the
treasures
of
the
godhead
must
be
hidden
in
him
and
therefore
by
him
only
can
be
revealed
this
will
interpret
all
things
or
it
has
not
yet
been
teachers
of
men
have
not
taught
this
because
they
have
not
seen
it
if
we
do
not
find
him
in
nature
we
may
conclude
either
that
we
do
not
understand
the
expression
of
nature
or
have
mistaken
ideas
or
poor
feelings
about
him
it
is
one
great
business
in
our
life
to
find
the
interpretation
which
will
render
this
harmony
visible
till
we
find
it
we
have
not
seen
him
to
be
all
in
all
recognising
a
discord
when
they
touched
the
notes
of
nature
and
society
the
hermits
forsook
the
instrument
altogether
and
contented
themselves
with
a
partial
symphony
lofty
narrow
and
weak
their
example
more
or
less
has
been
followed
by
almost
all
christians
exclusion
is
so
much
the
easier
way
of
getting
harmony
in
the
orchestra
than
study
insight
and
interpretation
that
most
have
adopted
it
it
is
for
us
and
all
who
have
hope
in
the
infinite
god
to
widen
its
basis
as
we
may
to
search
and
find
the
true
tone
and
right
idea
place
and
combination
of
instruments
until
to
our
enraptured
ear
they
all
with
one
voice
of
multiform
yet
harmonious
utterance
declare
the
glory
of
god
and
of
his
a
grand
idea
said
percivale
therefore
likely
to
be
a
true
one
i
returned
people
find
it
hard
to
believe
grand
things
but
why
if
there
be
a
god
is
it
not
likely
everything
is
grand
save
where
the
reflection
of
his
great
thoughts
is
shaken
broken
distorted
by
the
watery
mirrors
of
our
unbelieving
and
troubled
souls
things
ought
to
be
grand
simple
and
noble
the
ages
of
eternity
will
go
on
showing
that
such
they
are
and
ever
have
been
god
will
yet
be
victorious
over
our
wretched
i
was
sitting
facing
the
sea
but
with
my
eyes
fixed
on
the
sand
boring
holes
in
it
with
my
stick
for
i
could
talk
better
when
i
did
not
look
my
familiar
faces
in
the
face
i
did
not
feel
thus
in
the
pulpit
there
i
sought
the
faces
of
my
flock
to
assist
me
in
speaking
to
their
needs
as
i
drew
to
the
close
of
my
last
monologue
a
colder
and
stronger
blast
from
the
sea
blew
in
my
face
i
lifted
my
head
and
saw
that
the
tide
had
crept
up
a
long
way
and
was
coming
in
fast
a
luminous
fog
had
sunk
down
over
the
western
horizon
and
almost
hidden
the
sun
had
obscured
the
half
of
the
sea
and
destroyed
all
our
hopes
of
a
sunset
a
certain
veil
as
of
the
commonplace
like
that
which
so
often
settles
down
over
the
spirit
of
man
after
a
season
of
vision
and
glory
and
gladness
had
dropped
over
the
face
of
nature
the
wind
came
in
little
bitter
gusts
across
the
dull
waters
it
was
time
to
lift
connie
and
take
her
home
this
was
the
last
time
we
ate
together
on
the
open
shore
chapter
iii
a
pastoral
visit
the
next
morning
rose
neither
cherchef
t
in
a
comely
cloud
nor
roab
d
in
flames
and
amber
light
but
covered
all
in
a
rainy
mist
which
the
wind
mingled
with
salt
spray
torn
from
the
tops
of
the
waves
every
now
and
then
the
wind
blew
a
blastful
of
larger
drops
against
the
window
of
my
study
with
an
angry
clatter
and
clash
as
if
daring
me
to
go
out
and
meet
its
ire
the
earth
was
very
dreary
for
there
were
no
shadows
anywhere
the
sun
was
hustled
away
by
the
crowding
vapours
and
earth
sea
and
sky
were
possessed
by
a
gray
spirit
that
threatened
wrath
the
rang
and
i
went
down
expecting
to
find
my
wynnie
who
was
always
down
first
to
make
the
tea
standing
at
the
window
with
a
sad
face
giving
fit
response
to
the
aspect
of
nature
without
her
soul
talking
with
the
gray
spirit
i
did
find
her
at
the
window
looking
out
upon
the
restless
tossing
of
the
waters
but
with
no
despondent
answer
to
the
trouble
of
nature
on
the
contrary
her
cheek
though
neither
rosy
nor
radiant
looked
luminous
and
her
eyes
were
flashing
out
upon
the
which
was
sinking
away
into
the
troubled
ocean
beyond
does
my
expect
me
to
tell
her
next
that
something
had
happened
that
percivale
had
said
something
to
her
or
that
at
least
he
had
just
passed
the
window
and
given
her
a
look
which
she
might
interpret
as
she
pleased
i
must
disappoint
her
it
was
nothing
of
the
sort
i
knew
the
heart
and
feeling
of
my
child
it
was
only
that
kind
nature
was
in
sympathy
with
her
mood
the
girl
was
always
more
peaceful
in
storm
than
in
sunshine
i
remembered
that
now
a
movement
of
life
instantly
began
in
her
when
the
obligation
of
gladness
had
departed
with
the
light
her
own
being
arose
to
provide
for
its
own
needs
she
could
smile
now
when
nature
required
from
her
no
smile
in
response
to
hers
and
i
could
not
help
saying
to
myself
she
must
marry
a
poor
man
some
day
she
is
a
creature
of
the
north
and
not
of
the
south
the
hot
sun
of
prosperity
would
wither
her
up
give
her
a
bleak
and
a
glint
or
two
of
sunshine
between
the
hailstorms
and
she
will
live
and
grow
give
her
poverty
and
love
and
life
will
be
interesting
to
her
as
a
romance
give
her
money
and
position
and
she
will
grow
dull
and
haughty
she
will
believe
in
nothing
that
poet
can
sing
or
architect
build
she
will
like
cassius
scorn
her
spirit
for
being
moved
to
smile
at
i
had
stood
regarding
her
for
a
moment
she
turned
and
saw
me
and
came
forward
with
her
usual
morning
greeting
i
beg
your
pardon
papa
i
thought
it
was
i
am
glad
to
see
a
smile
on
your
face
my
don
t
think
me
very
disagreeable
papa
i
know
i
am
a
trouble
to
you
but
i
am
a
trouble
to
myself
first
i
fear
i
have
a
discontented
mind
and
a
complaining
temper
but
i
do
try
and
i
will
try
hard
to
overcome
it
will
not
get
the
better
of
you
so
long
as
you
do
the
duty
of
the
moment
but
i
think
as
i
told
you
before
that
you
are
not
very
well
and
that
your
indisposition
is
going
to
do
you
good
by
making
you
think
about
some
things
you
are
ready
to
think
about
but
which
you
might
have
banished
if
you
had
been
in
good
health
and
spirits
you
are
feeling
as
you
never
felt
before
that
you
need
a
presence
in
your
soul
of
which
at
least
you
haven
t
enough
yet
but
i
preached
quite
enough
to
you
yesterday
and
i
won
t
go
on
the
same
way
again
only
i
wanted
to
comfort
you
come
and
give
me
my
you
do
comfort
me
papa
she
answered
approaching
the
table
i
know
i
don
t
show
what
i
feel
as
i
ought
but
you
do
comfort
me
much
don
t
you
like
a
day
like
this
papa
i
do
my
dear
i
always
did
and
i
think
you
take
after
me
in
that
as
you
do
in
a
good
many
things
besides
that
is
how
i
understand
you
so
do
i
really
take
after
you
papa
are
you
sure
that
you
understand
me
so
well
she
asked
brightening
up
i
know
i
do
i
returned
replying
to
her
last
question
better
than
i
do
myself
she
asked
with
an
arch
smile
considerably
if
i
mistake
not
i
answered
how
delightful
to
think
that
i
am
understood
even
when
i
don
t
understand
myself
but
even
if
i
am
wrong
you
are
yet
understood
the
blessedness
of
life
is
that
we
can
hide
nothing
from
god
if
we
could
hide
anything
from
god
that
hidden
thing
would
by
and
by
turn
into
a
terrible
disease
it
is
the
sight
of
god
that
keeps
and
makes
things
clean
but
as
we
are
both
by
mutual
confession
fond
of
this
kind
of
weather
what
do
you
say
to
going
out
with
me
i
have
to
visit
a
sick
you
don
t
mean
coombes
papa
no
my
dear
i
did
not
hear
she
was
o
i
daresay
it
is
nothing
much
only
old
nursey
said
yesterday
she
was
in
bed
with
a
bad
cold
or
something
of
that
we
ll
call
and
inquire
as
we
pass
that
is
if
you
are
inclined
to
go
with
how
can
you
put
an
to
that
papa
i
have
just
had
a
message
from
that
cottage
that
stands
all
alone
on
the
corner
of
barton
s
farm
over
the
cliff
you
know
that
the
woman
is
ill
and
would
like
to
see
me
so
the
sooner
we
start
the
i
shall
have
done
my
breakfast
in
five
minutes
papa
o
here
s
mamma
mamma
i
m
going
out
for
a
walk
in
the
rain
with
papa
you
won
t
mind
will
you
i
don
t
think
it
will
do
you
any
harm
my
dear
that
s
all
i
mind
you
know
it
was
only
once
or
twice
when
you
were
not
well
that
i
objected
to
it
i
quite
agree
with
your
papa
that
only
lazy
people
are
to
stay
when
it
and
it
does
blow
so
delightfully
said
wynnie
as
she
left
the
room
to
put
on
her
long
cloak
and
her
bonnet
we
called
at
the
sexton
s
cottage
and
found
him
sitting
gloomily
by
the
low
window
looking
seaward
i
hope
your
wife
is
not
poorly
coombes
i
said
no
sir
she
be
very
comfortable
in
bed
bed
s
not
a
bad
place
to
be
in
in
such
weather
he
answered
turning
again
a
dreary
look
towards
the
atlantic
poor
things
what
a
passion
for
comfort
you
have
coombes
how
does
that
come
about
do
you
think
i
suppose
i
was
made
so
to
be
sure
you
were
god
made
you
surely
sir
who
else
then
i
suppose
he
likes
making
people
comfortable
if
he
makes
people
like
to
be
it
du
look
likely
enough
then
when
he
takes
it
out
of
your
hands
you
mustn
t
think
he
doesn
t
look
after
the
people
you
would
make
comfortable
if
you
i
must
mind
my
work
you
know
yes
surely
and
you
mustn
t
want
to
take
his
out
of
his
hands
and
go
grumbling
as
if
you
would
do
it
so
much
better
if
he
would
only
let
you
get
hand
to
i
daresay
you
be
right
sir
he
said
i
must
just
go
and
have
a
look
about
though
here
s
agnes
she
ll
tell
you
about
he
took
his
spade
from
the
corner
and
went
out
he
often
brought
his
tools
into
the
cottage
he
had
carved
the
handle
of
his
spade
all
over
with
the
names
of
the
people
he
had
buried
tell
your
mother
agnes
that
i
will
call
in
the
evening
and
see
her
if
she
would
like
to
see
me
we
are
going
now
to
see
stokes
she
is
very
poorly
i
let
us
go
through
the
churchyard
papa
said
wynnie
and
see
what
the
old
man
is
very
well
my
dear
it
is
only
a
few
steps
why
do
you
humour
the
sexton
s
foolish
fancy
so
much
papa
it
is
such
nonsense
you
taught
us
it
was
surely
in
your
sermon
about
the
resurrection
most
certainly
my
dear
but
it
would
be
of
no
use
to
try
to
get
it
out
of
his
head
by
any
argument
he
has
a
kind
of
craze
in
that
direction
to
get
people
s
hearts
right
is
of
much
more
importance
than
convincing
their
judgments
right
judgment
will
follow
all
such
fixed
ideas
should
be
encountered
from
the
deepest
grounds
of
truth
and
not
from
the
outsides
of
their
relations
coombes
has
to
be
taught
that
god
cares
for
the
dead
more
than
he
does
and
it
is
unreasonable
for
him
to
be
anxious
about
when
we
reached
the
churchyard
we
found
the
old
man
kneeling
on
a
grave
before
its
headstone
it
was
a
very
old
one
with
a
death
and
carved
upon
the
top
of
it
in
very
high
relief
with
his
he
was
removing
the
lumps
of
green
moss
out
of
the
hollows
of
the
eyes
of
the
carven
skull
we
did
not
interrupt
him
but
walked
past
with
a
nod
you
saw
what
he
was
doing
wynnie
that
reminds
me
of
almost
the
only
thing
in
dante
s
grand
poem
that
troubles
me
i
can
not
think
of
it
without
a
renewal
of
my
concern
though
i
have
no
doubt
he
is
as
sorry
now
as
i
am
that
ever
he
could
have
written
it
when
in
the
he
reaches
the
lowest
region
of
torture
which
is
a
solid
lake
of
ice
he
finds
the
lost
plunged
in
it
to
various
depths
some
if
i
remember
rightly
entirely
submerged
and
visible
only
through
the
ice
transparent
as
crystal
like
the
insects
found
in
amber
one
man
with
his
head
only
above
the
ice
appeals
to
him
as
condemned
to
the
same
punishment
to
take
pity
on
him
and
remove
the
lumps
of
frozen
tears
from
his
eyes
that
he
may
weep
a
little
before
they
freeze
again
and
stop
the
relief
once
more
dante
says
to
him
tell
me
who
you
are
and
if
i
do
not
assist
you
i
deserve
to
lie
at
the
bottom
of
the
ice
the
man
tells
him
who
he
is
and
explains
to
him
one
awful
mystery
of
these
regions
then
he
says
now
stretch
forth
thy
hand
and
open
my
and
says
dante
i
did
not
open
them
for
him
and
rudeness
to
him
was
but
he
promised
you
he
did
and
yet
he
did
not
do
it
pity
and
truth
had
abandoned
him
together
one
would
think
little
of
it
comparatively
were
it
not
that
dante
is
so
full
of
tenderness
and
grand
religion
it
is
very
awful
and
may
teach
us
many
but
what
made
you
think
of
that
now
merely
what
coombes
was
about
the
visual
image
was
all
he
was
scooping
the
green
moss
out
of
the
eyes
of
the
death
on
the
by
this
time
we
were
on
the
top
of
the
downs
and
the
wind
was
buffeting
us
and
every
other
minute
assailing
us
with
a
blast
of
rain
wynnie
drew
her
cloak
closer
about
her
bent
her
head
towards
the
blast
and
struggled
on
bravely
by
my
side
no
one
who
wants
to
enjoy
a
walk
in
the
rain
must
carry
an
umbrella
it
is
pure
folly
when
we
came
to
one
of
the
stone
fences
we
cowered
down
by
its
side
for
a
few
moments
to
recover
our
breath
and
then
struggled
on
again
anything
like
conversation
was
out
of
the
question
at
length
we
dropped
into
a
hollow
which
gave
us
a
little
repose
down
below
the
sea
was
dashing
into
the
mouth
of
the
glen
or
coomb
as
they
call
it
there
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
hollow
the
little
house
to
which
we
were
going
stood
up
against
the
gray
sky
i
begin
to
doubt
whether
i
ought
to
have
brought
you
wynnie
it
was
thoughtless
of
me
i
don
t
mean
for
your
sake
but
because
your
presence
may
be
embarrassing
in
a
small
house
for
probably
the
poor
woman
may
prefer
seeing
me
i
will
go
back
papa
i
sha
n
t
mind
it
a
no
you
had
better
come
on
i
shall
not
be
long
with
her
i
daresay
we
may
find
some
place
that
you
can
wait
in
are
you
wet
only
my
cloak
i
am
as
dry
as
a
tortoise
come
along
then
we
shall
soon
be
when
we
reached
the
house
i
found
that
wynnie
would
not
be
in
the
way
i
left
her
seated
by
the
and
was
shown
into
the
room
where
stokes
lay
i
can
not
say
i
perceived
but
i
guessed
somehow
the
moment
i
saw
her
that
there
was
something
upon
her
mind
she
was
a
woman
with
a
cold
troubled
black
eye
that
rolled
restlessly
about
she
lay
on
her
back
moving
her
head
from
side
to
side
when
i
entered
she
only
looked
at
me
and
turned
her
eyes
away
towards
the
wall
i
approached
the
bedside
and
seated
myself
by
it
i
always
do
so
at
once
for
the
patient
feels
more
at
rest
than
if
you
stand
tall
up
before
her
i
laid
my
hand
on
hers
are
you
very
ill
stokes
i
said
yes
very
she
answered
with
a
groan
it
be
come
to
the
last
with
i
hope
not
indeed
stokes
it
s
not
come
to
the
last
with
us
so
long
as
we
have
a
father
in
ah
but
it
be
with
me
he
can
t
take
any
notice
of
the
like
of
but
indeed
he
does
whether
you
think
it
or
not
he
takes
notice
of
every
thought
we
think
and
every
deed
we
do
and
every
sin
we
i
said
the
last
words
with
emphasis
for
i
suspected
something
more
than
usual
upon
her
conscience
she
gave
another
groan
but
made
no
reply
i
therefore
went
on
our
father
in
heaven
is
not
like
some
fathers
on
earth
who
so
long
as
their
children
don
t
bother
them
let
them
do
anything
they
like
he
will
not
have
them
do
what
is
wrong
he
loves
them
too
much
for
he
won
t
look
at
me
she
said
half
murmuring
half
sighing
it
out
so
that
i
could
hardly
hear
what
she
said
it
is
because
he
looking
at
you
that
you
are
feeling
uncomfortable
i
answered
he
wants
you
to
confess
your
sins
i
don
t
mean
to
me
but
to
himself
though
if
you
would
like
to
tell
me
anything
and
i
can
help
you
i
shall
be
glad
you
know
jesus
christ
came
to
save
us
from
our
sins
and
that
s
why
we
call
him
our
saviour
but
he
can
t
save
us
from
our
sins
if
we
won
t
confess
that
we
have
i
m
sure
i
never
said
but
what
i
be
a
great
sinner
as
well
as
other
you
don
t
suppose
that
s
confessing
your
sins
i
said
i
once
knew
a
woman
of
very
bad
character
who
allowed
to
me
she
was
a
great
sinner
but
when
i
said
yes
you
have
done
so
and
so
she
would
not
allow
one
of
those
deeds
to
be
worthy
of
being
reckoned
amongst
her
sins
when
i
asked
her
what
great
sins
she
had
been
guilty
of
then
seeing
these
counted
for
nothing
i
could
get
no
more
out
of
her
than
that
she
was
a
great
sinner
like
other
people
as
you
have
just
been
i
hope
you
don
t
be
thinking
i
ha
done
anything
of
that
sort
she
said
with
wakening
energy
no
man
or
woman
dare
say
i
ve
done
anything
to
be
ashamed
then
you
ve
committed
no
sins
i
returned
but
why
did
you
send
for
me
you
must
have
something
to
say
to
i
never
did
send
for
you
it
must
ha
been
my
ah
then
i
m
afraid
i
ve
no
business
here
i
returned
rising
i
thought
you
had
sent
for
she
returned
no
answer
i
hoped
that
by
retiring
i
should
set
her
thinking
and
make
her
more
willing
to
listen
the
next
time
i
came
i
think
clergymen
may
do
much
harm
by
insisting
when
people
are
in
a
bad
mood
as
if
they
had
everything
to
do
and
the
spirit
of
god
nothing
at
all
i
bade
her
hoped
she
would
be
better
soon
and
returned
to
wynnie
as
we
walked
home
together
i
said
wynnie
i
was
right
it
would
not
have
done
at
all
to
take
you
into
the
stokes
had
not
sent
for
me
herself
and
rather
resented
my
appearance
but
i
think
she
will
send
for
me
before
many
days
are
chapter
iv
the
art
of
nature
we
had
a
week
of
hazy
weather
after
this
i
spent
it
chiefly
in
my
study
and
in
connie
s
room
a
world
of
mist
hung
over
the
sea
it
refused
to
hold
any
communion
with
mortals
as
if
or
unhappy
it
folded
itself
in
its
mantle
and
lay
still
what
was
it
thinking
about
all
nature
is
so
full
of
meaning
that
we
can
not
help
fancying
sometimes
that
she
knows
her
own
meanings
she
is
busy
with
every
human
mood
in
turn
sometimes
with
ten
of
them
at
once
picturing
our
own
inner
world
before
us
that
we
may
see
understand
develop
reform
it
i
was
turning
over
some
such
thought
in
my
mind
one
morning
when
dora
knocked
at
the
door
saying
that
percivale
had
called
and
that
mamma
was
busy
and
would
i
mind
if
she
brought
him
up
to
the
study
not
in
the
least
my
dear
i
answered
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
see
not
much
of
weather
for
your
sacred
craft
percivale
i
said
as
he
entered
i
suppose
if
you
were
asked
to
make
a
sketch
it
would
be
much
the
same
as
if
a
stupid
woman
were
to
ask
you
to
take
her
portrait
not
quite
so
bad
as
that
said
percivale
surely
the
human
face
is
more
than
nature
is
never
the
woman
might
be
nature
is
full
of
beauty
in
her
worst
moods
while
the
prettier
such
a
woman
the
more
stupid
she
would
look
and
the
more
irksome
you
would
feel
the
task
for
you
could
not
help
making
claims
upon
her
which
you
would
never
think
of
making
upon
i
daresay
you
are
right
such
stupidity
has
a
good
deal
to
do
with
moral
causes
you
do
not
ever
feel
that
nature
is
to
nature
is
never
ugly
she
may
be
dull
sorrowful
troubled
she
may
be
lost
in
tears
and
pallor
but
she
can
not
be
ugly
it
is
only
when
you
rise
into
animal
nature
that
you
find
true
in
the
main
only
for
no
lines
of
absolute
division
can
be
drawn
in
nature
i
have
seen
ugly
i
grant
it
but
they
are
exceptional
and
none
of
them
are
without
surely
not
the
ugliest
soul
even
is
not
without
some
beauty
but
i
grant
you
that
the
higher
you
rise
the
more
is
ugliness
possible
just
because
the
greater
beauty
is
possible
there
is
no
ugliness
to
equal
in
its
repulsiveness
the
ugliness
of
a
beautiful
a
pause
followed
i
presume
i
said
you
are
thinking
of
returning
to
london
now
there
seems
so
little
to
be
gained
by
remaining
here
when
this
weather
begins
to
show
itself
i
could
wish
myself
in
my
own
parish
but
i
am
sure
the
change
even
through
the
winter
will
be
good
for
my
i
must
be
going
soon
he
answered
but
it
would
be
too
bad
to
take
offence
at
the
old
lady
s
first
touch
of
temper
i
mean
to
wait
and
see
whether
we
shall
not
have
a
little
bit
of
martin
s
summer
as
shakspere
calls
it
after
which
hail
london
queen
of
smoke
and
and
what
i
asked
seeing
he
hesitated
and
soap
i
was
fancying
you
would
say
for
you
never
will
allow
the
worst
of
things
no
surely
i
will
not
for
one
thing
the
worst
has
never
been
seen
by
anybody
yet
we
have
no
experience
to
justify
we
were
chatting
in
this
loose
manner
when
walter
came
to
the
door
to
tell
me
that
a
messenger
had
come
from
stokes
i
went
down
to
see
him
and
found
her
husband
my
wife
be
very
bad
sir
he
said
i
wish
you
could
come
and
see
does
she
want
to
see
me
i
asked
she
s
been
more
uncomfortable
than
ever
since
you
was
there
last
he
said
but
i
repeated
has
she
said
she
would
like
to
see
me
i
can
t
say
it
sir
answered
the
man
then
it
is
you
who
want
me
to
see
her
yes
sir
but
i
be
sure
she
do
want
to
see
you
i
know
her
way
you
see
sir
she
never
would
say
she
wanted
anything
in
her
life
she
would
always
leave
you
to
find
it
out
so
i
got
sharp
at
that
and
then
would
she
allow
she
had
wanted
it
when
you
got
it
her
no
never
sir
she
be
peculiar
my
wife
she
always
does
she
know
that
you
have
come
to
ask
me
now
no
have
you
courage
to
tell
her
the
man
hesitated
if
you
haven
t
courage
to
tell
her
i
resumed
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
i
can
t
go
or
rather
i
will
not
i
will
tell
her
then
you
will
tell
her
that
i
refused
to
come
until
she
sent
for
me
ben
t
that
rather
hard
on
a
dying
woman
sir
i
have
my
reasons
except
she
send
for
me
herself
the
moment
i
go
she
will
take
refuge
in
the
fact
that
she
did
not
send
for
me
i
know
your
wife
s
peculiarity
too
well
i
tell
her
sir
it
s
time
to
speak
my
own
i
think
so
it
was
time
long
ago
when
she
sends
for
me
if
it
be
in
the
middle
of
the
night
i
shall
be
with
her
at
he
left
me
and
i
returned
to
percivale
i
was
just
thinking
before
you
came
i
said
about
the
relation
of
nature
to
our
inner
world
you
know
i
am
quite
ignorant
of
your
art
but
i
often
think
about
the
truths
that
lie
at
the
root
of
i
am
greatly
obliged
to
you
he
said
for
talking
about
these
things
i
assure
you
it
is
of
more
service
to
me
than
any
professional
talk
i
always
think
the
professions
should
not
herd
together
so
much
as
they
do
they
want
to
be
shone
upon
from
other
i
believe
we
have
all
to
help
each
other
percivale
the
sun
himself
could
give
us
no
light
that
would
be
of
any
service
to
us
but
for
the
reflective
power
of
the
airy
particles
through
which
he
shines
but
anything
i
know
i
have
found
out
merely
by
foraging
for
my
own
that
is
just
what
makes
the
result
valuable
he
replied
tell
me
what
you
were
i
was
thinking
i
answered
how
everyone
likes
to
see
his
own
thoughts
set
outside
of
him
that
he
may
contemplate
them
as
the
philosophers
call
it
he
likes
to
see
the
other
side
of
them
as
it
yes
that
is
of
course
true
else
i
suppose
there
would
be
no
art
at
surely
but
that
is
not
the
aspect
in
which
i
was
considering
the
question
those
who
can
so
set
them
forth
are
artists
and
however
they
may
fail
of
effecting
such
a
representation
of
their
ideas
as
will
satisfy
themselves
they
yet
experience
satisfaction
in
the
measure
in
which
they
have
succeeded
but
there
are
many
more
men
who
can
not
yet
utter
their
ideas
in
any
form
mind
i
do
expect
that
if
they
will
only
be
good
they
shall
have
this
power
some
day
for
i
do
think
that
many
things
we
call
differences
in
kind
may
in
god
s
grand
scale
prove
to
be
only
differences
in
degree
and
indeed
the
artist
by
artist
i
mean
of
course
architect
musician
painter
poet
sculptor
in
many
things
requires
it
just
as
much
as
the
most
helpless
and
dumb
of
his
brethren
seeing
in
proportion
to
the
things
that
he
can
do
he
is
aware
of
the
things
he
can
not
do
the
thoughts
he
can
not
express
hence
arises
the
enthusiasm
with
which
people
hail
the
work
of
an
artist
they
rejoice
namely
in
seeing
their
own
thoughts
or
feelings
or
something
like
them
expressed
and
hence
it
comes
that
of
those
who
have
money
some
hang
their
walls
with
pictures
of
their
own
choice
others
i
beg
your
pardon
said
percivale
interrupting
but
most
people
i
fear
hang
their
walls
with
pictures
of
other
people
s
choice
for
they
don
t
buy
them
at
all
till
the
artist
has
got
a
that
is
true
and
yet
there
is
a
shadow
of
choice
even
there
for
they
won
t
at
least
buy
what
they
dislike
and
again
the
growth
in
popularity
may
be
only
what
first
attracted
their
attention
not
determined
their
but
there
are
others
who
only
buy
them
for
their
value
in
the
of
such
is
not
the
talk
as
the
germans
would
say
in
as
far
as
your
description
applies
such
are
only
tradesmen
and
have
no
claim
to
be
considered
then
i
beg
your
pardon
for
interrupting
i
am
punished
more
than
i
deserve
if
you
have
lost
your
i
don
t
think
i
have
let
me
see
yes
i
was
saying
that
people
hang
their
walls
with
pictures
of
their
choice
or
provide
music
of
their
choice
let
me
keep
to
the
pictures
their
choice
consciously
or
unconsciously
is
determined
by
some
expression
that
these
pictures
give
to
what
is
in
themselves
the
buyers
i
mean
they
like
to
see
their
own
feelings
outside
of
is
there
not
another
possible
motive
that
the
pictures
teach
them
something
that
i
venture
to
think
shows
a
higher
moral
condition
than
the
other
but
still
partakes
of
the
other
for
it
is
only
what
is
in
us
already
that
makes
us
able
to
lay
hold
of
a
lesson
it
is
there
in
the
germ
else
nothing
from
without
would
wake
it
i
do
not
quite
see
what
all
this
has
to
do
with
nature
and
her
one
step
more
and
i
shall
arrive
at
it
you
will
admit
that
the
pictures
and
objects
of
art
of
all
kinds
with
which
a
man
adorns
the
house
he
has
chosen
or
built
to
live
in
have
thenceforward
not
a
little
to
do
with
the
education
of
his
tastes
and
feelings
even
when
he
is
not
aware
of
it
they
are
working
upon
him
for
good
if
he
has
chosen
what
is
good
which
alone
shall
be
our
certainly
that
is
now
i
come
to
it
god
knowing
our
needs
built
our
house
for
our
needs
not
as
one
man
may
build
for
another
but
as
no
man
can
build
for
himself
for
our
comfort
education
training
he
has
put
into
form
for
us
all
the
otherwise
hidden
thoughts
and
feelings
of
our
heart
even
when
he
speaks
of
the
hidden
things
of
the
spirit
of
god
he
uses
the
forms
or
pictures
of
nature
the
world
is
as
it
were
the
human
unseen
world
turned
inside
out
that
we
may
see
it
on
the
walls
of
the
house
that
he
has
built
for
us
god
has
hung
up
the
pictures
pictures
of
all
that
passes
in
our
souls
form
and
colour
and
motion
are
there
never
wearying
without
this
living
portraiture
from
within
we
should
have
no
word
to
utter
that
should
represent
a
single
act
of
the
inner
world
metaphysics
could
have
no
existence
not
to
speak
of
poetry
not
to
speak
of
the
commonest
language
of
affection
but
all
is
done
in
such
spiritual
suggestion
portrait
and
definition
are
so
avoided
the
whole
is
in
such
fluent
evanescence
that
the
producing
mind
is
only
aided
never
overwhelmed
it
never
amounts
to
representation
it
affords
but
the
material
which
the
thinking
feeling
soul
can
use
interpret
and
apply
for
its
own
purposes
of
speech
it
is
as
it
were
the
forms
of
thought
cast
into
a
lovely
chaos
by
the
inferior
laws
of
matter
thence
to
be
withdrawn
by
what
we
call
the
creative
genius
that
god
has
given
to
men
and
moulded
and
modelled
and
arranged
and
built
up
to
its
own
shapes
and
its
own
then
i
presume
you
would
say
that
no
mere
transcript
if
i
may
use
the
word
of
nature
is
the
worthy
work
of
an
it
is
an
impossibility
to
make
a
mere
transcript
no
man
can
help
seeing
nature
as
he
is
himself
for
she
has
all
in
her
but
if
he
sees
no
meaning
in
especial
that
he
wants
to
give
his
portrait
of
her
will
represent
only
her
dead
face
not
her
living
impassioned
then
artists
ought
to
interpret
nature
indubitably
but
that
will
only
be
to
interpret
themselves
something
of
humanity
that
is
theirs
whether
they
have
discovered
it
already
or
not
if
to
this
they
can
add
some
teaching
for
humanity
then
indeed
they
may
claim
to
belong
to
the
higher
order
of
art
however
imperfect
they
may
be
in
their
powers
of
representing
however
lowly
therefore
their
position
may
be
in
that
chapter
the
sore
spot
we
went
on
talking
for
some
time
indeed
we
talked
so
long
that
the
was
approaching
when
one
of
the
maids
came
with
the
message
that
stokes
had
called
again
wishing
to
see
me
i
could
not
help
smiling
inwardly
at
the
news
i
went
down
at
once
and
found
him
smiling
too
my
wife
do
send
me
for
you
this
time
sir
he
said
between
you
and
me
i
can
not
help
thinking
she
have
something
on
her
mind
she
wants
to
tell
you
why
shouldn
t
she
tell
you
stokes
that
would
be
most
natural
and
then
if
you
wanted
any
help
about
it
why
of
course
here
i
she
don
t
think
well
enough
of
my
judgment
for
that
sir
and
i
daresay
she
be
quite
right
she
always
do
make
me
give
in
before
she
have
done
talking
but
she
have
been
a
right
good
wife
to
me
perhaps
she
would
have
been
a
better
if
you
hadn
t
given
in
quite
so
much
it
is
very
wrong
to
give
in
when
you
think
you
are
but
i
never
be
sure
of
it
when
she
talk
to
me
ah
then
i
have
nothing
to
say
except
that
you
ought
to
have
been
surer
i
don
t
say
but
she
do
want
you
very
bad
now
sir
i
don
t
think
she
ll
behave
to
you
as
she
did
before
do
come
of
course
i
will
i
returned
to
the
study
and
asked
percivale
if
he
would
like
to
go
with
me
he
looked
i
thought
as
if
he
would
rather
not
i
saw
that
it
was
hardly
kind
to
ask
him
well
perhaps
it
is
better
not
i
said
for
i
do
not
know
how
long
i
may
have
to
be
with
the
poor
woman
you
had
better
wait
here
and
take
my
place
at
the
i
promise
not
to
depose
you
if
i
should
return
before
the
meal
is
he
thanked
me
very
heartily
i
showed
him
into
the
told
my
wife
where
i
was
going
and
not
to
wait
dinner
for
me
i
would
take
my
chance
and
joined
stokes
you
have
no
idea
then
i
said
after
we
had
gone
about
what
makes
your
wife
so
uneasy
no
i
haven
t
he
answered
except
it
be
he
resumed
that
she
was
too
hard
as
i
thought
upon
our
mary
when
she
wanted
to
marry
beneath
her
as
wife
how
beneath
her
who
was
it
she
wanted
to
marry
she
did
marry
him
sir
she
has
a
bit
of
her
mother
s
temper
you
see
and
she
would
take
her
own
ah
there
s
a
lesson
to
mothers
is
it
not
if
they
want
to
have
their
own
way
they
mustn
t
give
their
own
temper
to
their
but
how
are
they
to
help
it
sir
ah
how
indeed
but
what
is
your
daughter
s
husband
a
labourer
sir
he
works
on
a
farm
out
by
but
you
have
worked
on
barton
s
farm
for
many
years
if
i
don
t
mistake
i
have
sir
but
i
am
a
sort
of
a
foreman
now
you
but
you
weren
t
so
always
and
your
whether
he
work
his
way
up
or
not
is
i
presume
much
where
you
were
when
you
married
stokes
true
as
you
say
sir
and
it
s
not
me
that
has
anything
to
say
about
it
i
never
gave
the
man
a
nay
but
you
see
my
wife
she
always
do
be
wanting
to
get
her
head
up
in
the
world
and
since
she
took
to
the
shopkeeping
the
shopkeeping
i
said
with
some
surprise
i
didn
t
know
well
you
see
sir
it
s
only
for
a
quarter
or
so
of
the
year
you
know
it
s
a
favourite
walk
for
the
folks
as
comes
here
for
the
bathing
past
our
house
to
see
the
great
cave
down
below
and
my
wife
she
got
a
bit
of
a
sign
put
up
and
put
a
few
bottles
in
the
window
and
a
bad
place
for
the
i
said
they
were
only
empty
ones
with
corks
and
strings
you
know
sir
my
wife
she
know
better
than
put
the
its
own
self
in
the
sun
but
i
do
think
she
carry
her
head
higher
after
that
and
a
as
they
call
them
was
none
good
enough
for
her
and
hasn
t
she
been
kind
to
her
since
she
married
then
she
s
never
done
her
no
harm
but
she
hasn
t
gone
to
see
her
very
often
or
asked
her
to
come
and
see
you
very
often
i
suppose
there
s
ne
er
a
one
o
them
crossed
the
door
of
the
other
he
answered
with
some
evident
feeling
of
his
own
in
the
matter
ah
but
you
don
t
approve
of
that
yourself
stokes
approve
of
it
no
sir
i
be
a
once
myself
and
so
i
do
want
to
see
my
own
daughter
now
and
then
but
she
take
after
her
mother
she
do
i
don
t
know
which
of
the
two
it
is
as
does
it
but
there
s
no
coming
and
going
between
carpstone
and
we
were
approaching
the
house
i
told
stokes
he
had
better
let
her
know
i
was
there
for
that
if
she
had
changed
her
mind
it
was
not
too
late
for
me
to
go
home
again
without
disturbing
her
he
came
back
saying
she
was
still
very
anxious
to
see
me
well
stokes
how
do
you
feel
i
asked
by
way
of
opening
the
conversation
i
don
t
think
you
look
much
i
he
much
worse
sir
you
don
t
know
what
i
suffer
or
you
wouldn
t
make
so
little
of
it
i
be
very
i
know
you
are
very
ill
but
i
hope
you
are
not
too
ill
to
tell
me
why
you
are
so
anxious
to
see
me
you
have
got
something
to
tell
me
i
with
pale
and
countenance
she
appeared
to
be
fighting
more
with
herself
than
with
the
disease
which
yet
had
nearly
overcome
her
the
drops
stood
upon
her
forehead
and
she
did
not
speak
wishing
to
help
her
if
i
might
i
said
was
it
about
your
daughter
you
wanted
to
speak
to
me
no
she
muttered
i
have
nothing
to
say
about
my
daughter
she
was
my
own
i
could
do
as
i
pleased
with
i
thought
with
myself
we
must
have
a
word
about
that
by
and
by
but
meantime
she
must
relieve
her
heart
of
the
one
thing
whose
pressure
she
feels
then
i
said
you
want
to
tell
me
about
something
that
was
not
your
own
who
said
i
ever
took
what
was
not
my
own
she
returned
fiercely
did
stokes
dare
to
say
i
took
anything
that
wasn
t
my
own
no
one
has
said
anything
of
the
sort
only
i
can
not
help
thinking
from
your
own
words
and
from
your
own
behaviour
that
that
must
be
the
cause
of
your
it
is
very
hard
that
the
parson
should
think
such
things
she
muttered
again
my
poor
woman
i
said
you
sent
for
me
because
you
had
something
to
confess
to
me
i
want
to
help
you
if
i
can
but
you
are
too
proud
to
confess
it
yet
i
see
there
is
no
use
in
my
staying
here
it
only
does
you
harm
so
i
will
bid
you
if
you
can
not
confess
to
me
confess
to
god
knows
it
i
suppose
without
yes
but
that
does
not
make
it
less
necessary
for
you
to
confess
it
how
is
he
to
forgive
you
if
you
won
t
allow
that
you
have
done
wrong
it
be
not
so
easy
that
as
you
think
how
would
you
like
to
say
you
had
took
something
that
wasn
t
your
own
well
i
shouldn
t
like
it
certainly
but
if
i
had
it
to
do
i
think
i
should
make
haste
and
do
it
and
so
get
rid
of
but
that
s
the
worst
of
it
i
can
t
get
rid
of
but
i
said
laying
my
hand
on
hers
and
trying
to
speak
as
kindly
as
i
could
although
her
whole
behaviour
would
have
been
exceedingly
repulsive
but
for
her
evidently
great
suffering
you
have
now
all
but
confessed
taking
something
that
did
not
belong
to
you
why
don
t
you
summon
courage
and
tell
me
all
about
it
i
want
to
help
you
out
of
the
trouble
as
easily
as
ever
i
can
but
i
can
t
if
you
don
t
tell
me
what
you
ve
got
that
isn
t
i
haven
t
got
anything
she
muttered
you
had
something
then
whatever
may
have
become
of
it
she
was
again
silent
what
did
you
do
with
it
i
rose
and
took
up
my
hat
she
stretched
out
her
hand
as
if
to
lay
hold
of
me
with
a
cry
stop
stop
i
ll
tell
you
all
about
it
i
lost
it
again
that
s
the
worst
of
it
i
got
no
good
of
what
was
it
a
sovereign
she
said
with
a
groan
and
now
i
m
a
thief
i
no
more
a
thief
than
you
were
before
rather
less
i
hope
but
do
you
think
it
would
have
been
any
better
for
you
if
you
hadn
t
lost
it
and
had
got
some
good
of
it
as
you
say
she
was
silent
yet
again
if
you
hadn
t
lost
it
you
would
most
likely
have
been
a
great
deal
worse
for
it
than
you
are
a
more
wicked
woman
i
m
not
a
wicked
it
is
wicked
to
steal
is
it
not
i
didn
t
steal
how
did
you
come
by
it
then
i
found
did
you
try
to
find
out
the
owner
no
i
knew
whose
it
then
it
was
very
wicked
not
to
return
it
and
i
say
again
that
if
you
had
not
lost
the
sovereign
you
would
have
been
most
likely
a
more
wicked
woman
than
you
it
was
very
hard
to
lose
it
i
could
have
given
it
back
and
then
i
wouldn
t
have
lost
my
character
as
i
have
done
this
yes
you
could
but
i
doubt
if
you
i
now
if
you
had
it
you
are
sure
you
would
give
it
back
yes
that
i
would
she
said
looking
me
so
full
in
the
face
that
i
was
sure
she
meant
it
how
would
you
give
it
back
would
you
get
your
husband
to
take
it
no
i
wouldn
t
trust
with
the
story
you
mean
i
you
do
not
wish
to
imply
that
he
would
not
restore
it
i
don
t
mean
that
he
would
do
what
i
told
how
would
you
return
it
then
i
should
make
a
parcel
of
it
and
send
without
saying
anything
about
it
yes
where
s
the
good
the
man
would
have
his
no
he
would
not
he
has
a
right
to
your
confession
for
you
have
wronged
him
that
would
never
you
are
too
hard
upon
me
she
said
beginning
to
weep
angrily
do
you
want
to
get
the
weight
of
this
sin
off
your
mind
i
said
of
course
i
do
i
am
going
to
die
o
dear
o
dear
then
that
is
just
what
i
want
to
help
you
in
you
must
confess
or
the
weight
of
it
will
stick
but
if
i
confess
i
shall
be
expected
to
pay
it
back
of
course
that
is
only
but
i
haven
t
got
it
i
tell
you
i
have
lost
have
you
not
a
sovereign
in
your
possession
no
not
can
t
you
ask
your
husband
to
let
you
have
one
there
i
knew
it
was
no
use
i
knew
you
would
only
make
matters
worse
i
do
wish
i
had
never
seen
that
wicked
you
ought
not
to
abuse
the
money
it
was
not
wicked
you
ought
to
wish
that
you
had
returned
it
but
that
is
no
use
the
thing
is
to
return
it
now
has
your
husband
got
a
sovereign
no
he
may
ha
got
one
since
i
be
laid
up
but
i
never
can
tell
him
about
it
and
i
should
be
main
sorry
to
spend
one
of
his
hard
earning
in
that
way
poor
well
i
ll
tell
him
and
we
ll
manage
it
i
thought
for
a
few
moments
she
would
break
out
in
opposition
but
she
hid
her
face
with
the
sheet
instead
and
burst
into
a
great
weeping
i
took
this
as
a
permission
to
do
as
i
had
said
and
went
to
the
and
called
her
husband
he
came
looking
scared
his
wife
did
not
look
up
but
lay
weeping
i
hoped
much
for
her
and
him
too
from
this
humiliation
before
him
for
i
had
little
doubt
she
needed
it
your
wife
poor
woman
i
said
is
in
great
distress
because
i
do
not
know
when
or
how
she
picked
up
a
sovereign
that
did
not
belong
to
her
and
instead
of
returning
put
it
away
somewhere
and
lost
it
this
is
what
is
making
her
so
deary
me
said
stokes
in
the
tone
with
which
he
would
have
spoken
to
a
sick
child
and
going
up
to
his
wife
he
sought
to
draw
down
the
sheet
from
her
face
apparently
that
he
might
kiss
her
but
she
kept
tight
hold
of
it
and
he
could
not
deary
me
he
went
on
we
ll
soon
put
that
all
to
rights
when
was
it
jane
that
you
found
it
when
we
wanted
so
to
have
a
pig
of
our
own
and
i
thought
i
could
soon
return
it
she
sobbed
from
under
the
sheet
deary
me
ten
years
ago
where
did
you
find
it
old
woman
i
saw
squire
tresham
drop
it
as
he
paid
me
for
some
he
got
for
some
ladies
that
was
with
him
i
do
believe
i
should
ha
given
it
back
at
the
time
but
he
made
faces
at
the
and
said
it
was
very
nasty
and
i
thought
well
i
would
punish
him
for
you
see
it
was
your
temper
that
made
a
thief
of
you
then
i
said
my
old
man
won
t
be
so
hard
on
me
as
you
sir
i
wish
i
had
told
him
i
would
wish
that
too
i
said
were
it
not
that
i
am
afraid
you
might
have
persuaded
him
to
be
silent
about
it
and
so
have
made
him
miserable
and
wicked
too
but
now
stokes
what
is
to
be
done
this
money
must
be
paid
have
you
got
it
the
poor
man
looked
blank
she
will
never
be
at
ease
till
this
money
is
paid
i
insisted
well
sir
i
ain
t
got
it
but
i
ll
borrow
it
of
someone
i
ll
go
to
master
and
ask
no
my
good
fellow
that
won
t
do
your
master
would
want
to
know
what
you
were
going
to
do
with
it
perhaps
and
we
mustn
t
let
more
people
know
about
it
than
just
ourselves
and
squire
tresham
there
is
no
occasion
for
that
i
ll
tell
you
what
i
ll
give
you
the
money
and
you
must
take
it
or
if
you
like
i
will
take
it
to
the
squire
and
tell
him
all
about
it
do
you
authorise
me
to
do
this
stokes
please
sir
it
s
very
kind
of
you
i
will
work
hard
to
pay
you
again
if
it
please
god
to
spare
me
i
am
very
sorry
i
was
so
to
you
sir
but
i
couldn
t
bear
the
disgrace
of
she
said
all
this
from
under
the
well
i
ll
go
i
said
and
as
soon
as
i
ve
had
my
dinner
i
ll
get
a
horse
and
ride
over
to
squire
tresham
s
i
ll
come
back
and
tell
you
about
it
and
now
i
hope
you
will
be
able
to
thank
god
for
forgiving
you
this
sin
but
you
must
not
hide
and
cover
it
up
but
confess
it
clean
out
to
him
you
she
made
me
no
answer
but
went
on
sobbing
i
hastened
home
and
as
i
entered
sent
walter
to
ask
the
loan
of
a
horse
which
a
gentleman
a
neighbour
had
placed
at
my
disposal
when
i
went
into
the
i
found
that
they
had
not
sat
down
to
dinner
i
expostulated
it
was
against
the
rule
of
the
house
when
my
return
was
uncertain
but
my
love
said
my
wife
why
should
you
not
let
us
please
ourselves
sometimes
dinner
is
so
much
nicer
when
you
are
with
i
am
very
glad
you
think
so
i
answered
but
there
are
the
children
it
is
not
good
for
growing
creatures
to
be
kept
waiting
for
their
you
see
there
are
no
children
they
have
had
their
always
in
the
right
wife
but
there
s
i
never
dine
till
seven
o
clock
to
save
daylight
he
said
then
i
am
beaten
on
all
points
let
us
during
dinner
i
could
scarcely
help
observing
how
percivale
s
eyes
followed
wynnie
or
rather
every
now
and
then
settled
down
upon
her
face
that
she
was
aware
almost
conscious
of
this
i
could
not
doubt
one
glance
at
her
satisfied
me
of
that
but
certain
words
of
the
apostle
kept
coming
again
and
again
into
my
mind
for
they
were
winged
words
those
and
even
when
they
did
not
enter
they
fluttered
their
wings
at
my
window
whatsoever
is
not
of
faith
is
and
i
kept
reminding
myself
that
i
must
heave
the
load
of
sin
off
me
as
i
had
been
urging
poor
stokes
to
do
for
god
was
ever
seeking
to
lift
it
only
he
could
not
without
my
help
for
that
would
be
to
do
me
more
harm
than
good
by
taking
the
one
thing
in
which
i
was
like
him
away
from
me
my
action
therefore
i
must
have
faith
in
him
and
not
be
afraid
for
surely
all
fear
is
sin
and
one
of
the
most
oppressive
sins
from
which
the
lord
came
to
save
us
before
dinner
was
over
the
horse
was
at
the
door
i
mounted
and
set
out
for
squire
tresham
s
i
found
him
a
rough
but
elderly
man
when
i
told
him
the
story
of
the
poor
woman
s
misery
he
was
quite
concerned
at
her
suffering
when
i
produced
the
sovereign
he
would
not
receive
it
at
first
but
requested
me
to
take
it
back
to
her
and
say
she
must
keep
it
by
way
of
an
apology
for
his
rudeness
about
her
for
i
took
care
to
tell
him
the
whole
story
thinking
it
might
be
a
lesson
to
him
too
but
i
begged
him
to
take
it
for
it
would
i
thought
not
only
relieve
her
mind
more
thoroughly
but
help
to
keep
her
from
coming
to
think
lightly
of
the
affair
afterwards
of
course
i
could
not
tell
him
that
i
had
advanced
the
money
for
that
would
have
quite
prevented
him
from
receiving
it
i
then
got
on
my
horse
again
and
rode
straight
to
the
cottage
well
stokes
i
said
it
s
all
over
now
that
s
one
good
thing
done
how
do
you
feel
yourself
now
i
feel
better
now
sir
i
hope
god
will
forgive
god
does
forgive
you
but
there
are
more
things
you
need
forgiveness
for
it
is
not
enough
to
get
rid
of
one
sin
we
must
get
rid
of
all
our
sins
you
know
they
re
not
nice
things
are
they
to
keep
in
our
hearts
it
is
just
like
shutting
up
nasty
corrupting
things
dead
carcasses
under
lock
and
key
in
our
most
secret
drawers
as
if
they
were
precious
i
wish
i
could
be
good
like
some
people
but
i
wasn
t
made
so
there
s
my
husband
now
i
do
believe
he
never
do
anything
wrong
in
his
life
but
then
you
see
he
would
let
a
child
take
him
and
far
better
too
infinitely
better
to
be
taken
in
indeed
there
is
no
harm
in
being
taken
in
but
there
is
awful
harm
in
taking
she
did
not
reply
and
i
went
on
i
think
you
would
feel
a
good
deal
better
yet
if
you
would
send
for
your
daughter
and
her
husband
now
and
make
it
up
with
them
especially
seeing
you
are
so
i
will
sir
i
will
directly
i
m
tired
of
having
my
own
way
but
i
was
made
you
weren
t
made
to
continue
so
at
all
events
god
gives
us
the
necessary
strength
to
resist
what
is
bad
in
us
he
is
making
at
you
now
only
you
must
give
in
else
he
can
not
get
on
with
the
making
of
you
i
think
very
likely
he
made
you
ill
now
just
that
you
might
bethink
yourself
and
feel
that
you
had
done
i
have
been
feeling
that
for
many
a
that
made
it
the
more
needful
to
make
you
ill
for
you
had
been
feeling
your
duty
and
yet
not
doing
it
and
that
was
worst
of
all
you
know
jesus
came
to
lift
the
weight
of
our
sins
our
very
sins
themselves
off
our
hearts
by
forgiving
them
and
helping
us
to
cast
them
away
from
us
everything
that
makes
you
uncomfortable
must
have
sin
in
it
somewhere
and
he
came
to
save
you
from
it
send
for
your
daughter
and
her
husband
and
when
you
have
done
that
you
will
think
of
something
else
to
set
right
that
s
but
there
would
be
no
end
to
that
way
of
it
certainly
not
till
everything
was
put
but
a
body
might
have
nothing
else
to
do
that
well
that
s
the
very
first
thing
that
has
to
be
done
it
is
our
business
in
this
world
we
were
not
sent
here
to
have
our
own
way
and
try
to
enjoy
that
is
hard
on
a
poor
woman
that
has
to
work
for
her
to
work
for
your
bread
is
not
to
take
your
own
way
for
it
is
god
s
way
but
you
have
wanted
many
things
your
own
way
now
if
you
would
just
take
his
way
you
would
find
that
he
would
take
care
you
should
enjoy
your
i
m
sure
i
haven
t
had
much
enjoyment
in
that
was
just
because
you
would
not
trust
him
with
his
own
business
but
must
take
it
into
your
hands
if
you
will
but
do
his
will
he
will
take
care
that
you
have
a
life
to
be
very
glad
of
and
very
thankful
for
and
the
longer
you
live
the
more
blessed
you
will
find
it
but
i
must
leave
you
now
for
i
have
talked
to
you
long
enough
you
must
try
and
get
a
sleep
i
will
come
and
see
you
again
if
you
please
do
sir
i
shall
be
very
as
i
rode
home
i
thought
if
the
lifting
of
one
sin
off
the
human
heart
was
like
a
resurrection
what
would
it
be
when
every
sin
was
lifted
from
every
heart
every
sin
then
discovered
in
one
s
own
soul
must
be
a
pledge
of
renewed
bliss
in
its
removing
and
when
the
thought
came
again
of
what
paul
had
said
somewhere
whatsoever
is
not
of
faith
is
sin
i
thought
what
a
weight
of
sin
had
to
be
lifted
from
the
earth
and
how
blessed
it
might
be
but
what
could
i
do
for
it
i
could
just
begin
with
myself
and
pray
god
for
that
inward
light
which
is
his
spirit
that
so
i
might
see
him
in
everything
and
rejoice
in
everything
as
his
gift
and
then
all
things
would
be
holy
for
whatsoever
is
of
faith
must
be
the
opposite
of
sin
and
that
was
my
part
towards
heaving
the
weight
of
sin
which
like
myriads
of
gravestones
was
pressing
the
life
out
of
us
men
off
the
whole
world
faith
in
god
is
life
and
righteousness
the
faith
that
trusts
so
that
it
will
obey
none
other
lord
lift
the
people
thou
hast
made
into
holy
obedience
and
thanksgiving
that
they
may
be
glad
in
this
thy
world
chapter
vi
the
gathering
storm
the
weather
cleared
up
again
the
next
day
and
for
a
fortnight
it
was
lovely
in
this
region
we
saw
less
of
the
sadness
of
the
dying
year
than
in
our
own
parish
for
there
being
so
few
trees
in
the
vicinity
of
the
ocean
the
autumn
had
nowhere
to
hang
out
her
mourning
flags
but
there
indeed
so
mild
is
the
air
and
so
equable
the
temperature
all
the
winter
through
compared
with
the
inland
counties
that
the
bitterness
of
the
season
is
almost
unknown
this
however
is
no
guarantee
against
furious
storms
of
wind
and
rain
not
long
after
the
occurrence
last
recorded
turner
paid
us
another
visit
i
confess
i
was
a
little
surprised
at
his
being
able
to
get
away
so
soon
again
for
of
all
men
a
country
surgeon
can
least
easily
find
time
for
a
holiday
but
he
had
managed
it
and
i
had
no
doubt
from
what
i
knew
of
him
had
made
thorough
provision
for
his
cure
in
his
absence
he
brought
us
good
news
from
home
everything
was
going
on
well
weir
was
working
as
hard
as
usual
and
everybody
agreed
that
i
could
not
have
got
a
man
to
take
my
place
better
he
said
he
found
connie
much
improved
and
from
my
own
observations
i
was
sure
he
was
right
she
was
now
able
to
turn
a
good
way
from
one
side
to
the
other
and
finding
her
health
so
steady
besides
turner
encouraged
her
in
making
gentle
and
frequent
use
of
her
strength
impressing
it
upon
her
however
that
everything
depended
on
avoiding
everything
like
a
jerk
or
twist
of
any
sort
i
was
with
them
when
he
said
this
she
looked
up
at
him
with
a
happy
smile
i
will
do
all
i
can
turner
she
said
to
get
out
of
people
s
way
as
soon
as
perhaps
she
saw
something
in
our
faces
that
made
her
add
i
know
you
don
t
mind
the
bother
i
am
but
i
do
i
want
to
help
and
not
be
helped
more
than
other
people
as
soon
as
possible
i
will
therefore
be
as
gentle
as
mamma
and
as
brave
as
papa
and
see
if
we
don
t
get
well
turner
i
mean
to
have
a
ride
on
old
spry
next
i
do
she
added
nodding
her
pretty
head
up
from
the
pillow
when
she
saw
the
glance
the
doctor
and
i
exchanged
look
here
she
went
on
poking
the
quilt
up
with
her
foot
magnificent
said
turner
but
mind
you
must
do
nothing
out
of
bravado
that
won
t
do
at
i
have
done
said
connie
putting
on
a
face
of
mock
submission
that
day
we
carried
her
out
for
a
few
minutes
but
hardly
laid
her
down
for
we
were
afraid
of
the
damp
from
the
earth
a
few
feet
nearer
or
farther
from
the
soil
will
make
a
difference
it
was
the
last
time
for
many
weeks
anyone
interested
in
my
connie
need
not
be
alarmed
it
was
only
because
of
the
weather
not
because
of
her
health
one
day
i
was
walking
home
from
a
visit
i
had
been
paying
to
stokes
she
was
much
better
in
a
fair
way
to
recover
indeed
and
her
mental
health
was
improved
as
well
her
manner
to
me
was
certainly
very
different
and
the
tone
of
her
voice
when
she
spoke
to
her
husband
especially
was
changed
a
certain
roughness
in
it
was
much
modified
and
i
had
good
hopes
that
she
had
begun
to
climb
up
instead
of
sliding
down
the
hill
of
difficulty
as
she
had
been
doing
hitherto
it
was
a
cold
and
gusty
afternoon
the
sky
eastward
and
overhead
was
tolerably
clear
when
i
set
out
from
home
but
when
i
left
the
cottage
to
return
i
could
see
that
some
change
was
at
hand
shaggy
vapours
of
light
gray
were
blowing
rapidly
across
the
sky
from
the
west
a
wind
was
blowing
fiercely
up
there
although
the
gusts
down
below
came
from
the
east
the
clouds
it
swept
along
with
it
were
formless
with
loose
fringes
disreputable
troubled
hasty
clouds
they
were
looking
like
mischief
they
reminded
me
of
shelley
s
ode
to
the
west
wind
in
which
he
compares
the
loose
clouds
to
hair
and
calls
them
the
locks
of
the
approaching
away
to
the
west
a
great
thick
curtain
of
fog
of
a
luminous
yellow
covered
all
the
extending
north
and
south
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
it
looked
ominous
a
surly
secret
seemed
to
lie
in
its
bosom
now
and
then
i
could
discern
the
dim
ghost
of
a
vessel
through
it
as
tacking
for
north
or
south
it
came
near
enough
to
the
edge
of
the
fog
to
show
itself
for
a
few
moments
ere
it
retreated
again
into
its
bosom
there
was
exhaustion
it
seemed
to
me
in
the
air
notwithstanding
the
coolness
of
the
wind
and
i
was
glad
when
i
found
myself
comfortably
seated
by
the
fire
and
saw
wynnie
bestirring
herself
to
make
the
tea
it
looks
stormy
i
think
wynnie
i
said
her
eye
lightened
as
she
looked
out
to
sea
from
the
window
you
seem
to
like
the
idea
of
it
i
added
you
told
me
i
was
like
you
papa
and
you
look
as
if
you
liked
the
idea
of
it
certainly
a
storm
is
pleasant
to
me
i
should
not
like
a
world
without
storms
any
more
than
i
should
like
that
frenchman
s
idea
of
the
perfection
of
the
earth
when
all
was
to
be
smooth
as
a
lawn
rocks
and
mountains
banished
and
the
sea
breaking
on
the
shore
only
in
wavelets
of
or
lemonade
i
forget
which
but
the
older
you
grow
the
more
sides
of
a
thing
will
present
themselves
to
your
contemplation
the
storm
may
be
grand
and
exciting
in
itself
but
you
can
not
help
thinking
of
the
people
that
are
in
it
think
for
a
moment
of
the
multitude
of
vessels
great
and
small
which
are
gathered
within
the
skirts
of
that
angry
vapour
out
there
i
fear
the
toils
of
the
storm
are
around
them
look
at
the
barometer
in
the
hall
my
dear
and
tell
me
what
it
she
went
and
returned
it
was
not
very
low
papa
only
at
rain
but
the
moment
i
touched
it
the
hand
dropped
an
yes
i
thought
so
all
things
look
stormy
it
may
not
be
very
bad
here
that
doesn
t
make
much
difference
though
does
it
papa
no
further
than
that
being
creatures
in
time
and
space
we
must
think
of
things
from
our
own
but
i
remember
very
well
how
when
we
were
children
you
would
not
let
nurse
teach
us
watts
s
hymns
for
children
because
you
said
they
tended
to
encourage
yes
i
remember
it
very
well
some
of
them
make
the
contrast
between
the
misery
of
others
and
our
own
comforts
so
immediately
the
apparent
mind
i
only
say
apparent
ground
of
thankfulness
that
they
are
not
fit
for
teaching
i
do
think
that
if
you
could
put
watts
to
the
question
he
would
abjure
any
such
intention
saying
that
only
he
meant
to
heighten
the
sense
of
our
obligation
but
it
does
tend
to
selfishness
and
what
is
worse
and
is
very
dangerous
therefore
what
right
have
i
to
thank
god
that
i
am
not
as
other
men
are
in
anything
i
have
to
thank
god
for
the
good
things
he
has
given
to
me
but
how
dare
i
suppose
that
he
is
not
doing
the
same
for
other
people
in
proportion
to
their
capacity
i
don
t
like
to
appear
to
condemn
watts
s
hymns
certainly
he
has
written
the
very
worst
hymns
i
know
but
he
has
likewise
written
the
best
for
public
worship
i
well
but
papa
i
have
heard
you
say
that
any
simple
feeling
that
comes
of
itself
can
not
be
wrong
in
itself
if
i
feel
a
delight
in
the
idea
of
a
storm
i
can
not
help
it
i
never
said
you
could
my
dear
i
only
said
that
as
we
get
older
other
things
we
did
not
feel
at
first
come
to
show
themselves
more
to
us
and
impress
us
thus
my
child
and
i
went
on
like
two
pendulums
crossing
each
other
in
their
swing
trying
to
reach
the
same
dead
beat
of
mutual
intelligence
but
said
wynnie
you
say
everybody
is
in
god
s
hands
as
well
as
yes
surely
my
dear
as
much
out
in
yon
stormy
haze
as
here
beside
the
then
we
ought
not
to
be
miserable
about
them
even
if
there
comes
a
storm
ought
we
no
surely
and
besides
i
think
if
we
could
help
any
of
them
the
very
persons
that
enjoyed
the
storm
the
most
would
be
the
busiest
to
rescue
them
from
it
at
least
i
fancy
so
but
isn
t
the
tea
ready
yes
papa
i
ll
just
go
and
tell
when
she
returned
with
her
mother
and
the
children
had
joined
us
wynnie
resumed
the
talk
i
know
what
i
am
going
to
say
is
absurd
papa
and
yet
i
don
t
see
my
way
out
of
it
logically
i
suppose
you
would
call
it
what
is
the
use
of
taking
any
trouble
about
them
if
they
are
in
god
s
hands
why
should
we
try
to
take
them
out
of
god
s
hands
ah
wynnie
at
least
you
do
not
seek
to
hide
your
bad
logic
or
whatever
you
call
it
take
them
out
of
god
s
hands
if
you
could
do
that
it
would
be
perdition
indeed
god
s
hands
is
the
only
safe
place
in
the
universe
and
the
universe
is
in
his
hands
are
we
not
in
god
s
hands
on
the
shore
because
we
say
they
are
in
his
hands
who
go
down
to
the
sea
in
ships
if
we
draw
them
on
shore
surely
they
are
not
out
of
god
s
i
see
i
see
but
god
could
save
them
without
yes
but
what
would
become
of
us
then
god
is
so
good
to
us
that
we
must
work
our
little
salvation
in
the
earth
with
him
just
as
a
father
lets
his
little
child
help
him
a
little
that
the
child
may
learn
to
be
and
to
do
so
god
puts
it
in
our
hearts
to
save
this
life
to
our
fellows
because
we
would
instinctively
save
it
to
ourselves
if
we
could
he
requires
us
to
do
our
but
god
may
not
mean
to
save
he
may
mean
them
to
be
drowned
we
do
not
know
but
we
know
that
we
must
try
our
little
salvation
for
it
will
never
interfere
with
god
s
great
and
good
and
perfect
will
ours
will
be
foiled
if
he
sees
that
but
people
always
say
when
anyone
escapes
unhurt
from
an
accident
by
the
mercy
of
they
don
t
say
it
is
by
the
mercy
of
god
when
he
is
but
can
not
be
expected
ought
not
to
say
what
they
do
not
feel
their
own
first
sensation
of
deliverance
from
impending
death
would
break
out
in
a
thank
god
and
therefore
they
say
it
is
god
s
mercy
when
another
is
saved
if
they
go
farther
and
refuse
to
consider
it
god
s
mercy
when
a
man
is
drowned
that
is
just
the
sin
of
the
world
the
want
of
faith
but
the
man
who
creeps
out
of
the
drowning
choking
billows
into
the
glory
of
the
new
heavens
and
the
new
earth
do
you
think
his
thanksgiving
for
the
mercy
of
god
which
has
delivered
him
is
less
than
that
of
the
man
who
creeps
exhausted
and
worn
out
of
the
waves
on
to
the
dreary
shore
in
nothing
do
we
show
less
faith
than
the
way
in
which
we
think
and
speak
about
death
o
death
where
is
thy
sting
o
grave
where
is
thy
victory
says
the
apostle
here
here
here
cry
the
christian
people
everywhere
it
is
an
awful
sting
a
fearful
victory
but
god
keeps
it
away
from
us
many
a
time
when
we
ask
him
to
let
it
pierce
us
to
the
heart
at
last
to
be
sure
but
that
can
t
be
i
mean
this
is
how
they
feel
in
their
hearts
who
do
not
believe
that
god
is
as
merciful
when
he
sends
death
as
when
he
sends
life
who
christian
people
as
they
are
yet
look
upon
death
as
an
evil
thing
which
can
not
be
avoided
and
would
if
they
might
live
always
be
content
to
live
always
death
or
life
each
is
god
s
for
he
is
not
the
god
of
the
dead
but
of
the
living
there
are
no
dead
for
all
live
to
but
don
t
you
think
we
naturally
shrink
from
death
harry
said
my
wife
there
can
be
no
doubt
about
that
my
then
if
it
be
natural
god
must
have
meant
that
it
should
be
doubtless
to
begin
with
but
not
to
continue
or
end
with
a
child
s
sole
desire
is
for
food
the
very
best
possible
to
begin
with
but
how
would
it
be
if
the
child
should
reach
say
two
years
of
age
and
refuse
to
share
this
same
food
with
his
little
brother
or
what
comes
of
the
man
who
never
so
far
rises
above
the
desire
for
food
that
could
make
him
forget
his
just
so
the
life
of
christians
should
be
strong
enough
to
overcome
the
fear
of
death
we
ought
to
love
and
believe
him
so
much
that
when
he
says
we
shall
not
die
we
should
at
least
believe
that
death
must
be
something
very
different
from
what
it
looks
to
us
to
be
so
different
that
what
we
mean
by
the
word
does
not
apply
to
the
reality
at
all
and
so
jesus
can
not
use
the
word
because
it
would
seem
to
us
that
he
meant
what
we
mean
by
it
which
he
seeing
it
all
round
can
not
that
does
seem
quite
reasonable
said
ethelwyn
turner
had
taken
no
part
in
the
conversation
he
too
had
just
come
in
from
a
walk
over
the
hills
he
was
now
standing
looking
out
at
the
sea
she
looks
uneasy
does
she
not
i
said
you
mean
the
atlantic
he
returned
looking
round
yes
i
think
so
i
am
glad
she
is
not
a
patient
of
mine
i
fear
she
is
going
to
be
very
feverish
probably
delirious
before
morning
she
won
t
sleep
much
and
will
talk
rather
loud
when
the
tide
comes
disease
has
often
an
ebb
and
flow
like
the
tide
has
it
not
often
some
diseases
are
like
a
plant
that
has
its
time
to
grow
and
blossom
then
dies
others
as
you
say
ebb
and
flow
again
and
again
before
they
it
seems
to
me
however
that
the
ebb
and
flow
does
not
belong
to
the
disease
but
to
nature
which
works
through
the
disease
it
seems
to
me
that
my
life
has
its
tides
just
like
the
ocean
only
a
little
more
regularly
it
is
high
water
with
me
always
in
the
morning
and
the
evening
in
the
afternoon
life
is
at
its
lowest
and
i
believe
it
is
lowest
again
while
we
sleep
and
hence
it
comes
that
to
work
the
brain
at
night
has
such
an
injurious
effect
on
the
system
but
this
is
perhaps
all
a
there
may
be
some
truth
in
it
but
i
was
just
thinking
when
you
spoke
to
me
what
a
happy
thing
it
is
that
the
tide
does
not
vary
by
an
even
six
hours
but
has
the
odd
minutes
whence
we
see
endless
changes
in
the
relation
of
the
water
to
the
times
of
the
day
and
then
the
and
the
what
a
provision
there
is
in
the
world
for
change
yes
change
is
one
of
the
forms
that
infinitude
takes
for
the
use
of
us
human
immortals
but
come
and
have
some
tea
turner
you
will
not
care
to
go
out
again
what
shall
we
do
this
evening
shall
we
all
go
to
connie
s
room
and
have
some
shakspere
i
could
wish
nothing
better
what
play
shall
we
have
let
us
have
the
night
s
dream
said
ethelwyn
you
like
to
go
by
contraries
apparently
ethel
but
you
re
quite
right
it
is
in
the
winter
of
the
year
that
art
must
give
us
its
summer
i
suspect
that
most
of
the
poetry
about
spring
and
summer
is
written
in
the
winter
it
is
generally
when
we
do
not
possess
that
we
lay
full
value
upon
what
we
there
is
one
reason
said
wynnie
with
a
roguish
look
why
i
like
that
i
should
think
there
might
be
more
than
one
but
one
reason
is
enough
for
a
woman
at
once
isn
t
it
papa
i
m
not
sure
of
that
but
what
is
your
reason
that
the
fairies
are
not
allowed
to
play
any
tricks
with
the
women
are
true
i
might
choose
to
say
that
was
because
they
were
not
and
i
might
venture
to
answer
that
shakspere
being
true
to
nature
always
as
you
say
papa
knew
very
well
how
absurd
it
would
be
to
represent
a
woman
s
feelings
as
under
the
influence
of
the
juice
of
a
paltry
capital
wynnie
said
her
mother
and
turner
and
i
chimed
in
with
our
approbation
shall
i
tell
you
what
i
like
best
in
the
play
said
turner
it
is
the
common
sense
of
theseus
in
accounting
for
all
the
bewilderments
of
the
but
said
ethelwyn
he
was
wrong
after
all
what
is
the
use
of
common
sense
if
it
leads
you
wrong
the
common
sense
of
theseus
simply
amounted
to
this
that
he
would
only
believe
his
own
i
think
walton
is
right
turner
i
said
for
my
part
i
have
more
admired
the
of
hippolyta
who
would
yield
more
weight
to
the
consistency
of
the
various
testimony
than
could
be
altogether
counterbalanced
by
the
negation
of
her
own
experience
now
i
will
tell
you
what
i
most
admire
in
the
play
it
is
the
reconciling
power
of
the
poet
he
brings
together
such
marvellous
contrasts
without
a
single
shock
or
jar
to
your
feeling
of
the
artistic
harmony
of
the
conjunction
think
for
a
moment
the
ordinary
commonplace
courtiers
the
lovers
men
and
women
in
the
condition
of
all
conditions
in
which
might
get
a
hold
of
them
the
quarrelling
king
and
queen
of
fairyland
with
their
courtiers
blossom
cobweb
and
the
rest
and
the
puck
the
ignorant
clownish
artisans
rehearsing
their
play
fairies
and
clowns
lovers
and
courtiers
are
all
mingled
in
one
exquisite
harmony
clothed
with
a
night
of
early
summer
rounded
in
by
the
wedding
of
the
king
and
queen
but
i
have
talked
enough
about
it
let
us
get
our
as
we
sat
in
connie
s
room
delighting
ourselves
with
the
reflex
of
the
poet
s
fancy
the
sound
of
the
rising
tide
kept
mingling
with
the
and
the
foolish
rehearsal
musk
roses
said
titania
and
the
first
of
the
blast
going
round
by
south
to
west
rattled
the
window
good
hay
sweet
hay
hath
no
fellow
said
bottom
and
the
roar
of
the
waters
was
in
our
ears
so
doth
the
woodbine
the
sweet
honeysuckle
gently
entwist
said
titania
and
the
blast
poured
the
rain
in
a
spout
against
the
window
slow
in
pursuit
but
matched
in
mouth
like
bells
said
theseus
and
the
wind
whistled
shrill
through
the
chinks
of
the
opening
from
the
room
we
drew
the
curtains
closer
made
up
the
fire
higher
and
read
on
it
was
time
for
supper
ere
we
had
done
and
when
we
left
connie
to
have
hers
and
go
to
sleep
it
was
with
the
hope
that
through
all
the
rising
storm
she
would
dream
of
summer
woods
chapter
vii
the
gathered
storm
i
woke
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
the
darkness
to
hear
the
wind
howling
it
was
wide
awake
now
and
up
with
intent
it
seized
the
house
and
shook
it
furiously
and
the
rain
kept
pouring
only
i
could
not
hear
it
save
in
the
passages
of
the
wind
but
through
all
the
wind
i
could
hear
the
roaring
of
the
big
waves
on
the
shore
i
did
not
wake
my
wife
but
i
got
up
put
on
my
and
went
softly
to
connie
s
room
to
see
whether
she
was
awake
for
i
feared
if
she
were
she
would
be
frightened
wynnie
always
slept
in
a
little
bed
in
the
same
room
i
opened
the
door
very
gently
and
peeped
in
the
fire
was
burning
for
wynnie
was
an
admirable
stoker
and
could
generally
keep
the
fire
in
all
night
i
crept
to
the
bedside
there
was
just
light
enough
to
see
that
connie
was
fast
asleep
and
that
her
dreams
were
not
of
storms
it
was
a
marvel
how
well
the
child
always
slept
but
as
i
turned
to
leave
the
room
wynnie
s
voice
called
me
in
a
whisper
approaching
her
bed
i
saw
her
wide
eyes
like
the
eyes
of
the
darkness
for
i
could
scarcely
see
anything
of
her
face
awake
darling
i
said
yes
papa
i
have
been
awake
a
long
time
but
isn
t
connie
sleeping
delightfully
she
does
sleep
so
well
sleep
is
surely
very
good
for
it
is
the
best
thing
for
us
all
next
to
god
s
spirit
i
sometimes
think
my
dear
but
are
you
frightened
by
the
storm
is
that
what
keeps
you
awake
i
don
t
think
that
is
what
keeps
me
awake
but
sometimes
the
house
shakes
so
that
i
do
feel
a
little
nervous
i
don
t
know
how
it
is
i
never
felt
afraid
of
anything
natural
what
our
lord
said
about
not
being
afraid
of
anything
that
could
only
hurt
the
body
applies
here
and
in
all
the
terrors
of
the
night
think
about
him
i
do
try
papa
don
t
you
stop
you
will
get
cold
it
is
a
dreadful
storm
is
it
not
suppose
there
should
be
people
drowning
out
there
now
there
may
be
my
love
people
are
dying
almost
every
other
moment
i
suppose
on
the
face
of
the
earth
drowning
is
only
an
easy
way
of
dying
mind
they
are
all
in
god
s
yes
papa
i
will
turn
round
and
shut
my
eyes
and
fancy
that
his
hand
is
over
them
making
them
dark
with
his
and
it
will
not
be
fancy
my
darling
if
you
do
you
remember
those
odd
but
no
less
devout
lines
of
george
herbert
just
after
he
says
so
beautifully
and
now
with
darkness
closest
weary
eyes
he
adds
thus
in
thy
ebony
box
thou
dost
enclose
us
till
the
day
put
our
amendment
in
our
way
and
give
new
wheels
to
our
disordered
he
is
very
fond
of
boxes
by
the
way
so
go
to
sleep
dear
you
are
a
good
clock
of
god
s
making
but
you
want
new
wheels
according
to
our
beloved
brother
george
herbert
therefore
sleep
this
was
tiresome
talk
was
it
in
the
middle
of
the
night
reader
well
but
my
child
did
not
think
so
i
know
dark
dank
weeping
the
morning
dawned
all
dreary
was
the
earth
and
sky
the
wind
was
still
hunting
the
clouds
across
the
heavens
it
lulled
a
little
while
we
sat
at
breakfast
but
soon
the
storm
was
up
again
and
the
wind
raved
i
went
out
the
wind
caught
me
as
if
with
invisible
human
hands
and
shook
me
i
fought
with
it
and
made
my
way
into
the
village
the
streets
were
deserted
i
peeped
up
the
as
i
passed
not
a
man
or
horse
was
to
be
seen
the
little
shops
looked
as
if
nobody
had
crossed
their
thresholds
for
a
week
not
a
door
was
open
one
child
came
out
of
the
baker
s
with
a
big
loaf
in
her
apron
the
wind
threatened
to
blow
the
hair
off
her
head
if
not
herself
first
into
the
canal
i
took
her
by
the
hand
and
led
her
or
rather
let
her
lead
me
home
while
i
kept
her
from
being
carried
away
by
the
wind
having
landed
her
safely
inside
her
mother
s
door
i
went
on
climbed
the
heights
above
the
village
and
looked
abroad
over
the
atlantic
what
a
waste
of
aimless
tossing
to
and
fro
gray
mist
above
full
of
falling
rain
gray
wrathful
waters
underneath
foaming
and
bursting
as
billow
broke
upon
billow
the
tide
was
ebbing
now
but
almost
every
other
wave
swept
the
breakwater
they
burst
on
the
rocks
at
the
end
of
it
and
rushed
in
shattered
spouts
and
clouds
of
spray
far
into
the
air
over
their
heads
will
the
time
ever
come
i
thought
when
man
shall
be
able
to
store
up
even
this
force
for
his
own
ends
who
can
tell
the
solitary
form
of
a
man
stood
at
some
distance
gazing
as
i
was
gazing
out
on
the
ocean
i
walked
towards
him
thinking
with
myself
who
it
could
be
that
loved
nature
so
well
that
he
did
not
shrink
from
her
even
in
her
most
uncompanionable
moods
i
suspected
and
soon
found
i
was
right
it
was
percivale
what
a
clashing
of
i
said
thinking
of
a
line
somewhere
in
coleridge
s
remorse
they
are
but
after
all
that
make
this
great
noise
upon
the
rocks
only
there
is
a
great
many
of
yes
said
percivale
but
look
out
yonder
you
see
a
single
sail
that
is
all
i
can
see
away
in
the
mist
there
as
soon
as
you
think
of
the
human
struggle
with
the
elements
as
soon
as
you
know
that
hearts
are
in
the
midst
of
it
it
is
a
clashing
of
no
more
it
is
an
awful
power
with
which
the
will
and
all
that
it
rules
have
to
fight
for
the
mastery
or
at
least
for
surely
you
are
right
it
is
the
presence
of
thought
feeling
effort
that
gives
the
majesty
to
everything
it
is
even
a
dim
attribution
of
human
feelings
to
this
tormented
passionate
sea
that
gives
it
much
of
its
awe
although
as
we
were
saying
the
other
day
it
is
only
of
the
troubled
mind
but
as
i
have
now
seen
how
matters
are
with
the
elements
and
have
had
a
good
pluvial
bath
as
well
i
think
i
will
go
home
and
change
my
i
have
hardly
had
enough
of
it
yet
returned
percivale
i
shall
have
a
stroll
along
the
heights
here
and
when
the
tide
has
fallen
a
little
way
from
the
foot
of
the
cliffs
i
shall
go
down
on
the
sands
and
watch
awhile
well
you
re
a
younger
man
than
i
am
but
i
ve
seen
the
day
as
lear
says
what
an
odd
tendency
we
old
men
have
to
boast
of
the
past
we
would
be
judged
by
the
past
not
by
the
present
we
always
speak
of
the
strength
that
is
withered
and
gone
as
if
we
had
some
claim
upon
it
still
but
i
am
not
going
to
talk
in
this
storm
i
am
always
i
will
go
with
you
as
far
as
the
village
and
then
i
will
turn
and
take
my
way
along
the
downs
for
a
mile
or
two
i
don
t
mind
being
i
didn
t
don
t
you
think
resumed
percivale
that
in
some
sense
the
old
man
not
that
i
can
allow
that
dignity
yet
walton
has
a
right
to
regard
the
past
as
his
own
that
would
be
scanned
i
answered
as
we
walked
towards
the
village
surely
the
results
of
the
past
are
the
man
s
own
any
action
of
the
man
s
upon
which
the
life
in
him
reposes
remains
his
but
suppose
a
man
had
done
a
good
deed
once
and
instead
of
making
that
a
foundation
upon
which
to
build
more
good
grew
so
vain
of
it
that
he
became
incapable
of
doing
anything
more
of
the
same
sort
you
could
not
say
that
the
action
belonged
to
him
still
therein
he
has
severed
his
connection
with
the
past
again
what
has
never
in
any
deep
sense
been
a
man
s
own
can
not
surely
continue
to
be
his
afterwards
thus
the
things
that
a
man
has
merely
possessed
once
the
very
people
who
most
admired
him
for
their
sakes
when
he
had
them
give
him
no
credit
for
after
he
has
lost
them
riches
that
have
taken
to
themselves
wings
leave
with
the
poor
man
only
a
surpassing
poverty
strength
likewise
which
can
so
little
depend
on
any
exercise
of
the
will
in
man
passes
from
him
with
the
years
it
was
not
his
all
the
time
it
was
but
lent
him
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
his
inward
force
a
bodily
feeble
man
may
put
forth
a
mighty
in
effort
and
show
nothing
to
the
eyes
of
his
neighbour
while
the
strong
man
gains
endless
admiration
for
what
he
could
hardly
help
but
the
effort
of
the
one
remains
for
it
was
his
own
the
strength
of
the
other
passes
from
him
for
it
was
never
his
own
so
with
beauty
which
the
commonest
woman
acknowledges
never
to
have
been
hers
in
seeking
to
restore
it
by
deception
so
likewise
in
a
great
measure
with
but
if
you
take
away
intellect
as
well
what
do
you
leave
a
man
that
can
in
any
way
be
called
his
own
certainly
his
intellect
is
not
his
own
one
thing
only
is
his
own
to
will
the
truth
this
too
is
as
much
god
s
gift
as
everything
else
i
ought
to
say
is
more
god
s
gift
than
anything
else
for
he
gives
it
to
be
the
man
s
own
more
than
anything
else
can
be
and
when
he
wills
the
truth
he
has
god
himself
man
possess
god
all
other
things
follow
as
necessary
results
what
poor
creatures
we
should
have
been
if
god
had
not
made
us
to
do
something
to
look
heavenwards
to
lift
up
the
hands
that
hang
down
and
strengthen
the
feeble
knees
something
like
this
was
in
the
mind
of
the
prophet
jeremiah
when
he
said
thus
saith
the
lord
let
not
the
wise
man
glory
in
his
wisdom
neither
let
the
mighty
man
glory
in
his
might
let
not
the
rich
man
glory
in
his
riches
but
let
him
that
glorieth
glory
in
this
that
he
understandeth
and
knoweth
me
that
i
am
the
lord
which
exercise
judgment
and
righteousness
in
the
earth
for
in
these
things
i
delight
saith
the
my
own
conviction
is
that
a
vague
sense
of
a
far
higher
life
in
ourselves
than
we
yet
know
anything
about
is
at
the
root
of
all
our
false
efforts
to
be
able
to
think
something
of
ourselves
we
can
not
commend
ourselves
and
therefore
we
set
about
priding
ourselves
we
have
little
or
no
strength
of
mind
faculty
of
operation
or
worth
of
will
and
therefore
we
talk
of
our
strength
of
body
worship
the
riches
we
have
or
have
not
it
is
all
one
and
boast
of
our
paltry
intellectual
successes
the
man
most
ambitious
of
being
considered
a
universal
genius
must
at
last
confess
himself
a
conceited
dabbler
and
be
ready
to
part
with
all
he
knows
for
one
glimpse
more
of
that
understanding
of
god
which
the
wise
men
of
old
held
to
be
essential
to
every
man
but
which
the
growing
luminaries
of
the
present
day
will
not
allow
to
be
even
possible
for
any
we
had
reached
the
brow
of
the
heights
and
here
we
parted
a
fierce
blast
of
wind
rushed
at
me
and
i
hastened
down
the
hill
how
dreary
the
streets
did
look
how
much
more
dreary
than
the
stormy
down
i
saw
no
living
creature
as
i
returned
but
a
terribly
draggled
dog
a
cat
that
seemed
to
have
a
bad
conscience
and
a
lovely
little
which
forgetful
of
its
own
rights
would
flatten
the
tip
of
the
nose
belonging
to
it
against
a
every
was
a
mimic
sea
and
had
a
mimic
storm
within
its
own
narrow
bounds
the
water
went
hurrying
down
the
kennels
like
a
long
brown
snake
anxious
to
get
to
its
hole
and
hide
from
the
tormenting
wind
and
every
now
and
then
the
rain
came
in
full
rout
before
the
conquering
blast
when
i
got
home
i
peeped
in
at
connie
s
door
the
first
thing
and
saw
that
she
was
raised
a
little
more
than
usual
that
is
the
end
of
the
conch
against
which
she
leaned
was
at
a
more
acute
angle
she
was
sitting
staring
rather
than
gazing
out
at
the
wild
tumult
which
she
could
see
over
the
shoulder
of
the
down
on
which
her
window
immediately
looked
her
face
was
paler
and
keener
than
usual
why
connie
who
set
you
up
so
straight
mr
turner
papa
i
wanted
to
see
out
and
he
raised
me
himself
he
says
i
am
so
much
better
i
may
have
it
in
the
seventh
notch
as
often
as
i
but
you
look
too
tired
for
it
hadn
t
you
better
lie
down
again
it
s
only
the
storm
the
more
reason
you
should
not
see
it
if
it
tires
you
it
does
not
tire
me
papa
only
i
keep
constantly
wondering
what
is
going
to
come
out
of
it
it
looks
so
as
if
something
must
you
didn
t
hear
me
come
into
your
room
last
night
connie
the
storm
was
raging
then
as
loud
as
it
is
now
but
you
were
out
of
its
reach
fast
asleep
now
it
is
too
much
for
you
you
must
lie
very
well
i
lowered
the
support
and
when
i
returned
from
changing
my
wet
garments
she
was
already
looking
much
better
after
dinner
i
went
to
my
study
but
when
evening
began
to
fall
i
went
out
again
i
wanted
to
see
how
our
next
neighbours
the
sexton
and
his
wife
were
faring
the
wind
had
already
increased
in
violence
it
threatened
to
blow
a
hurricane
the
tide
was
again
rising
and
was
coming
in
with
great
rapidity
the
old
mill
shook
to
the
foundation
as
i
passed
through
it
to
reach
the
lower
part
where
they
lived
when
i
peeped
in
from
the
bottom
of
the
stair
i
saw
no
one
but
hearing
the
steps
of
someone
overhead
i
called
out
agnes
s
voice
made
answer
as
she
descended
an
inner
stair
which
led
to
the
bedrooms
above
mother
s
gone
to
church
gone
to
church
i
said
a
vague
pang
darting
through
me
as
i
thought
whether
i
had
forgotten
any
service
but
the
next
moment
i
recalled
what
the
old
woman
had
herself
told
me
of
her
preference
for
the
church
during
a
storm
o
yes
agnes
i
remember
i
said
your
mother
thinks
the
weather
bad
enough
to
take
to
the
church
does
she
how
do
you
come
to
be
here
now
where
is
your
husband
he
ll
be
here
in
an
hour
or
so
sir
he
don
t
mind
the
wet
you
see
we
don
t
like
the
old
people
to
be
left
alone
when
it
blows
what
the
sailors
call
great
and
what
becomes
of
his
mother
then
there
don
t
be
any
sea
out
there
sir
leastways
she
added
with
a
quiet
smile
and
stopped
you
mean
i
suppose
agnes
that
there
is
never
any
perturbation
of
the
elements
out
there
she
laughed
for
she
understood
me
well
enough
the
temper
of
joe
s
mother
was
proverbial
but
really
sir
she
said
she
don
t
mind
the
weather
a
bit
and
though
we
don
t
live
in
the
same
cottage
with
her
for
joe
wouldn
t
hear
of
that
we
see
her
far
oftener
than
we
see
my
mother
you
i
m
sure
it
s
quite
fair
agnes
is
joe
very
sorry
that
he
married
you
now
she
hung
her
head
and
blushed
so
deeply
through
all
her
sallow
complexion
that
i
was
sorry
i
had
teased
her
and
said
so
this
brought
a
reply
i
don
t
think
he
be
sir
i
do
think
he
gets
better
he
s
been
working
very
hard
the
last
week
or
two
and
he
says
it
agrees
with
and
how
are
you
quite
well
thank
you
i
had
never
seen
her
look
half
so
well
life
was
evidently
a
very
different
thing
to
both
of
them
now
i
left
her
and
took
my
way
to
the
church
when
i
reached
the
churchyard
there
in
the
middle
of
the
rain
and
the
gathering
darkness
was
the
old
man
busy
with
the
duties
of
his
calling
a
certain
headstone
stood
right
under
a
drip
from
the
roof
of
the
southern
transept
and
this
drip
had
caused
the
mould
at
the
foot
of
the
stone
on
the
side
next
the
wall
to
sink
so
that
there
was
a
considerable
crack
between
the
stone
and
the
soil
the
old
man
had
cut
some
sod
from
another
part
of
the
churchyard
and
was
now
standing
with
the
rain
pouring
on
him
from
the
roof
beating
this
sod
down
in
the
crack
he
was
sheltered
from
the
wind
by
the
church
but
he
was
as
wet
as
he
could
be
i
may
mention
that
he
never
appeared
in
the
least
disconcerted
when
i
came
upon
him
in
the
discharge
of
his
functions
he
was
so
content
with
his
own
feeling
in
the
matter
that
no
difference
of
opinion
could
disturb
him
this
will
never
do
coombes
i
said
you
will
get
your
death
of
cold
you
must
be
as
full
of
water
as
a
sponge
old
man
there
s
rheumatism
in
the
world
it
be
only
my
work
sir
but
i
believe
i
ha
done
now
for
a
night
i
think
he
ll
be
a
bit
more
comfortable
now
the
very
wind
could
get
at
him
through
that
do
go
home
then
i
said
and
change
your
clothes
is
your
wife
in
the
church
she
be
sir
this
door
sir
this
door
he
added
as
he
saw
me
going
round
to
the
usual
entrance
you
ll
find
her
in
i
lifted
the
great
latch
and
entered
i
could
not
see
her
at
first
for
it
was
much
darker
inside
the
church
it
felt
very
quiet
in
there
somehow
although
the
place
was
full
of
the
noise
of
winds
and
waters
coombes
was
not
sitting
on
the
where
i
looked
for
her
first
for
the
wind
blew
down
the
tower
in
many
currents
and
draughts
how
it
did
roar
up
there
as
if
the
louvres
had
been
a
windsail
to
catch
the
wind
and
send
it
down
to
ventilate
the
church
she
was
sitting
at
the
foot
of
the
with
her
stocking
as
usual
the
sight
of
her
sweet
old
face
lighted
up
by
a
moonlike
smile
as
i
drew
near
her
in
the
middle
of
the
ancient
dusk
filled
with
sounds
but
only
sounds
of
tempest
gave
me
a
sense
of
one
dwelling
in
the
secret
place
of
the
most
high
such
as
i
shall
never
forget
it
was
no
time
to
say
much
however
how
long
do
you
mean
to
stay
here
coombes
i
asked
not
all
night
no
not
all
night
surely
sir
but
i
hadn
t
thought
o
going
yet
for
a
why
there
s
coombes
out
there
wet
to
the
skin
and
i
m
afraid
he
ll
go
on
pottering
at
the
churchyard
till
he
gets
his
bones
as
full
of
rheumatism
as
they
can
deary
me
i
didn
t
know
as
my
old
man
was
there
he
tould
me
he
had
them
all
comforble
for
the
winter
a
week
ago
but
to
be
sure
there
s
always
some
mendin
to
i
heard
the
voice
of
joe
outside
and
the
next
moment
he
came
into
the
church
after
speaking
to
me
he
turned
to
coombes
you
be
comin
home
with
me
mother
this
will
never
do
father
s
as
wet
as
a
mop
i
ha
brought
something
for
your
supper
and
aggy
s
of
it
and
we
re
going
to
be
comfortable
over
the
fire
and
have
a
chapter
or
two
of
the
new
testament
to
keep
down
the
noise
of
the
sea
there
come
the
old
woman
drew
her
cloak
over
her
head
put
her
knitting
carefully
in
her
pocket
and
stood
aside
for
me
to
lead
the
way
no
no
i
said
i
m
the
shepherd
and
you
re
the
sheep
so
i
ll
drive
you
before
me
at
least
you
and
coombes
joe
here
will
be
offended
if
i
take
on
me
to
say
i
am
nay
nay
don
t
say
that
sir
you
ve
been
a
good
shepherd
to
me
when
i
was
a
very
sulky
sheep
but
if
you
ll
please
to
go
sir
i
ll
lock
the
door
behind
for
you
know
in
them
parts
the
shepherd
goes
first
and
the
sheep
follow
the
shepherd
and
i
ll
follow
like
a
good
sheep
he
added
laughing
you
re
right
joe
i
said
and
took
the
lead
without
more
ado
i
was
struck
by
his
saying
which
seemed
to
indicate
a
habit
of
pondering
on
the
places
as
well
as
circumstances
of
the
the
sexton
joined
us
at
the
door
and
we
all
walked
to
his
cottage
joe
taking
care
of
his
and
i
taking
what
care
i
could
of
coombes
by
carrying
his
tools
for
him
but
as
we
went
i
feared
i
had
done
ill
in
that
for
the
wind
blew
so
fiercely
that
i
thought
the
thin
feeble
little
man
would
have
got
on
better
if
he
had
been
more
heavily
weighted
against
it
but
i
made
him
take
a
hold
of
my
arm
and
so
we
got
in
the
old
man
took
his
tools
from
me
and
set
them
down
in
the
mill
for
the
roof
of
which
i
felt
some
anxiety
as
we
passed
through
so
full
of
wind
was
the
whole
space
but
when
we
opened
the
inner
door
the
welcome
of
a
glowing
fire
burst
up
the
stair
as
if
that
had
been
a
well
of
warmth
and
light
below
i
went
down
with
them
coombes
departed
to
change
his
clothes
and
the
rest
of
us
stood
round
the
fire
where
agnes
was
busy
cooking
something
like
white
puddings
for
their
supper
did
you
hear
sir
said
joe
that
the
coastguard
is
off
to
the
there
s
a
vessel
ashore
there
they
say
i
met
them
on
the
road
with
the
how
far
off
is
that
joe
some
five
or
six
miles
i
suppose
along
the
coast
nor
what
sort
of
a
vessel
is
she
that
i
don
t
know
some
say
she
be
a
schooner
others
a
brigantine
the
didn
t
know
poor
things
said
coombes
if
any
of
them
comes
ashore
they
ll
be
sadly
knocked
to
pieces
on
the
rocks
in
a
night
like
she
had
caught
a
little
infection
of
her
husband
s
mode
of
thought
it
s
not
likely
to
clear
up
before
morning
i
fear
is
it
joe
i
don
t
think
so
sir
there
s
no
will
you
condescend
to
sit
down
and
take
a
share
with
us
sir
said
the
old
woman
there
would
be
no
condescension
in
that
coombes
i
will
another
time
with
all
my
heart
but
in
such
a
night
i
ought
to
be
at
home
with
my
own
people
they
will
be
more
uneasy
if
i
am
of
coorse
of
coorse
so
i
ll
bid
you
i
wish
this
storm
were
well
i
buttoned
my
pulled
my
hat
down
on
my
head
and
set
out
it
was
getting
on
for
high
water
the
night
was
growing
very
dark
there
would
be
a
moon
some
time
but
the
clouds
were
so
dense
she
could
not
do
much
while
they
came
between
the
roaring
of
the
waves
on
the
shore
was
terrible
all
i
could
see
of
them
now
was
the
whiteness
of
their
breaking
but
they
filled
the
earth
and
the
air
with
their
furious
noises
the
wind
roared
from
the
sea
two
oceans
were
breaking
on
the
land
only
to
the
one
had
been
set
a
hitherto
to
the
other
none
ere
the
night
was
far
gone
however
i
had
begun
to
doubt
whether
the
ocean
itself
had
not
broken
its
bars
i
found
the
whole
household
full
of
the
storm
the
children
kept
pressing
their
faces
to
the
windows
trying
to
pierce
as
by
force
of
will
through
the
darkness
and
discover
what
the
wild
thing
out
there
was
doing
they
could
see
nothing
all
was
one
mass
of
blackness
and
dismay
with
a
soul
in
it
of
ceaseless
roaring
i
ran
up
to
connie
s
room
and
found
that
she
was
left
alone
she
looked
restless
pale
and
frightened
the
house
quivered
and
still
the
wind
howled
and
whistled
through
the
adjoining
connie
darling
have
they
left
you
alone
i
said
only
for
a
few
minutes
papa
i
don
t
mind
don
t
he
frightened
at
the
storm
my
dear
he
who
could
walk
on
the
sea
of
galilee
and
still
the
storm
of
that
little
pool
can
rule
the
atlantic
just
as
well
jeremiah
says
he
divideth
the
sea
when
the
waves
thereof
the
same
moment
dora
came
running
into
the
room
papa
she
cried
the
spray
such
a
lot
of
it
came
dashing
on
the
windows
in
the
will
it
break
them
i
hope
not
my
dear
just
stay
with
connie
while
i
run
o
papa
i
do
want
to
what
do
you
want
to
see
dora
the
storm
it
is
as
black
as
pitch
you
can
t
see
o
but
i
want
to
to
be
beside
well
you
sha
n
t
stay
with
connie
if
you
are
not
willing
go
along
ask
wynnie
to
come
the
child
was
so
possessed
by
the
commotion
without
that
she
did
not
seem
even
to
see
my
rebuke
not
to
say
feel
it
she
ran
off
and
wynnie
presently
came
i
left
her
with
connie
put
on
a
long
waterproof
cloak
and
went
down
to
the
a
door
led
from
it
immediately
on
to
the
little
green
in
front
of
the
house
between
it
and
the
sea
the
was
dark
for
they
had
put
out
the
lights
that
they
might
see
better
from
the
windows
the
children
and
some
of
the
servants
were
there
looking
out
i
opened
the
door
cautiously
it
needed
the
strength
of
two
of
the
women
to
shut
it
behind
me
the
moment
i
opened
it
a
great
sheet
of
spray
rushed
over
me
i
went
down
the
little
grassy
slope
the
rain
had
ceased
and
it
was
not
quite
so
dark
as
i
had
expected
i
could
see
the
gleaming
whiteness
all
before
me
the
next
moment
a
wave
rolled
over
the
low
wall
in
front
of
me
breaking
on
it
and
wrapping
me
round
in
a
sheet
of
water
something
hurt
me
sharply
on
the
leg
and
i
found
on
searching
that
one
of
the
large
flat
stones
that
lay
for
coping
on
the
top
of
the
wall
was
on
the
grass
beside
me
if
it
had
struck
me
straight
it
must
have
broken
my
leg
there
came
a
little
lull
in
the
wind
and
just
as
i
turned
to
go
into
the
house
again
i
thought
i
heard
a
gun
i
stood
and
listened
but
heard
nothing
more
and
fancied
i
must
have
been
mistaken
i
returned
and
tapped
at
the
door
but
i
had
to
knock
loudly
before
they
heard
me
within
when
i
went
up
to
the
i
found
that
percivale
had
joined
our
party
he
and
turner
were
talking
together
at
one
of
the
windows
did
you
hear
a
gun
i
asked
them
no
was
there
one
i
m
not
sure
i
i
heard
one
but
no
other
followed
there
will
be
a
good
many
fired
though
along
this
awful
i
suppose
they
keep
the
always
ready
said
turner
no
even
i
fear
would
live
in
such
a
sea
i
said
remembering
what
the
officer
of
the
had
told
me
they
would
try
though
i
suppose
said
turner
i
do
not
know
said
percivale
i
don
t
know
the
people
but
i
have
seen
a
out
in
as
bad
a
night
whether
in
as
bad
a
sea
i
can
not
tell
that
depends
on
the
coast
i
we
went
on
chatting
for
some
time
wondering
how
the
had
fared
with
the
vessel
ashore
at
the
wynnie
joined
us
how
is
connie
now
my
dear
very
restless
and
excited
papa
i
came
down
to
say
that
if
turner
didn
t
mind
i
wish
he
would
go
up
and
see
of
course
instantly
said
turner
and
moved
to
follow
winnie
but
the
same
moment
as
if
it
had
been
beside
us
in
the
room
so
clear
so
shrill
was
it
we
heard
connie
s
voice
shrieking
papa
papa
there
s
a
great
ship
ashore
down
there
come
come
turner
and
i
rushed
from
the
room
in
fear
and
dismay
how
what
where
could
the
voice
come
from
was
the
unformed
movement
of
our
thoughts
but
the
moment
we
left
the
the
thing
was
clear
though
not
the
less
marvellous
and
alarming
we
forgot
all
about
the
ship
and
thought
only
of
our
connie
so
much
does
the
near
hide
the
greater
that
is
afar
connie
kept
on
calling
and
her
voice
guided
our
eyes
a
little
stair
led
immediately
from
this
floor
up
to
the
so
that
it
might
be
reached
without
passing
through
the
bedroom
the
door
at
the
top
of
it
was
open
the
door
that
led
from
connie
s
room
into
the
was
likewise
open
and
light
shone
through
it
into
the
place
enough
to
show
a
figure
standing
by
the
furthest
window
with
face
pressed
against
the
glass
and
from
this
figure
came
the
cry
papa
papa
quick
quick
the
waves
will
knock
her
to
pieces
in
very
truth
it
was
connie
standing
there
chapter
viii
the
shipwreck
things
that
happen
altogether
have
to
be
told
one
after
the
other
turner
and
i
both
rushed
at
the
narrow
stair
there
was
not
room
for
more
than
one
upon
it
i
was
first
but
stumbled
on
the
lowest
step
and
fell
turner
put
his
foot
on
my
back
jumped
over
me
sprang
up
the
stair
and
when
i
reached
the
top
of
it
after
him
he
was
meeting
me
with
connie
in
his
arms
carrying
her
back
to
her
room
but
the
girl
kept
crying
papa
papa
the
ship
the
ship
my
duty
woke
in
me
turner
could
attend
to
connie
far
better
than
i
could
i
made
one
spring
to
the
window
the
moon
was
not
to
be
seen
but
the
clouds
were
thinner
and
light
enough
was
soaking
through
them
to
show
a
mass
some
little
way
out
in
the
bay
and
in
that
one
moment
in
which
i
stood
looking
a
shriek
pierced
the
howling
of
the
wind
cutting
through
it
like
a
knife
i
rushed
from
the
house
when
or
how
the
resolve
was
born
in
me
i
do
not
know
but
i
flew
straight
to
the
sexton
s
snatched
the
key
from
the
wall
crying
only
ship
ashore
and
rushed
to
the
church
i
remember
my
hand
trembled
so
that
i
could
hardly
get
the
key
into
the
lock
i
made
myself
quieter
opened
the
door
and
feeling
my
way
to
the
tower
knelt
before
the
keys
of
the
opened
the
chest
and
struck
them
wildly
fiercely
an
awful
jangling
out
of
tune
and
harsh
burst
into
monstrous
being
in
the
air
music
itself
was
untuned
corrupted
and
returning
to
chaos
i
struck
and
struck
at
the
keys
i
knew
nothing
of
their
normal
use
noise
outcry
was
all
i
meant
in
a
few
minutes
i
heard
voices
and
footsteps
from
some
parts
of
the
village
out
of
sight
of
the
shore
men
and
women
gathered
to
the
summons
through
the
door
of
the
church
which
i
had
left
open
came
voices
in
hurried
question
ship
ashore
was
all
i
could
answer
for
what
was
to
be
done
i
was
helpless
to
think
i
wondered
that
so
few
appeared
at
the
cry
of
the
bells
after
those
first
nobody
came
for
what
seemed
a
long
time
i
believe
however
i
was
beating
the
alarum
for
only
a
few
minutes
altogether
though
when
i
look
back
upon
the
time
in
the
dark
church
it
looks
like
at
least
but
indeed
i
feel
so
confused
about
all
the
doings
of
that
night
that
in
attempting
to
describe
them
in
order
i
feel
as
if
i
were
walking
in
a
dream
still
from
comparing
mine
with
the
recollected
impressions
of
others
i
think
i
am
able
to
give
a
tolerably
correct
result
most
of
the
incidents
seem
burnt
into
my
memory
so
that
nothing
could
destroy
the
depth
of
the
impression
but
the
order
in
which
they
took
place
is
none
the
less
doubtful
a
hand
was
laid
on
my
shoulder
who
is
there
i
said
for
it
was
far
too
dark
to
know
anyone
percivale
what
is
to
be
done
the
coastguard
is
away
nobody
seems
to
know
about
anything
it
is
of
no
use
to
go
on
ringing
more
everybody
is
out
even
to
the
come
down
to
the
shore
and
you
will
but
is
there
not
the
nobody
seems
to
know
anything
about
it
except
it
s
no
manner
of
use
to
go
trying
of
that
with
such
a
sea
but
there
must
be
someone
in
command
of
it
i
said
yes
returned
percivale
but
there
doesn
t
seem
to
be
one
of
the
crew
amongst
the
crowd
all
the
fellows
are
going
about
with
their
hands
in
their
let
us
make
haste
then
i
said
perhaps
we
can
find
out
are
you
sure
the
coastguard
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
i
believe
not
they
have
enough
to
do
with
their
i
remember
now
that
roxton
told
me
he
had
far
more
confidence
in
his
rockets
than
in
anything
a
could
do
upon
this
coast
at
while
we
spoke
we
came
to
the
bank
of
the
canal
this
we
had
to
cross
in
order
to
reach
that
part
of
the
shore
opposite
which
the
wreck
lay
to
my
surprise
the
canal
itself
was
in
a
storm
heaving
and
tossing
and
dashing
over
its
banks
percivale
i
exclaimed
the
gates
are
gone
the
sea
has
torn
them
yes
i
suppose
so
would
god
i
could
get
men
to
help
me
i
have
been
doing
what
i
could
but
i
have
no
influence
amongst
what
do
you
mean
i
asked
what
could
you
do
if
you
had
a
thousand
men
at
your
command
he
made
me
no
answer
for
a
few
moments
during
which
we
were
hurrying
on
for
the
bridge
over
the
canal
then
he
said
they
regard
me
only
as
a
meddling
stranger
i
suppose
for
i
have
been
able
to
get
no
useful
answer
they
are
all
excited
but
nobody
is
doing
they
must
know
about
it
a
great
deal
better
than
we
i
returned
and
we
must
take
care
not
to
do
them
the
injustice
of
supposing
they
are
not
ready
to
do
all
that
can
be
percivale
was
silent
yet
again
the
record
of
our
conversation
looks
as
quiet
on
the
paper
as
if
we
had
been
talking
in
a
curtained
room
but
all
the
time
the
ocean
was
raving
in
my
very
ear
and
the
awful
tragedy
was
going
on
in
the
dark
behind
us
the
wind
was
almost
as
loud
as
ever
but
the
rain
had
quite
ceased
and
when
we
reached
the
bridge
the
moon
shone
out
white
as
if
aghast
at
what
she
had
at
length
succeeded
in
pushing
the
clouds
aside
that
she
might
see
awe
and
helplessness
oppressed
us
having
crossed
the
canal
we
turned
to
the
shore
there
was
little
of
it
left
for
the
waves
had
rushed
up
almost
to
the
village
the
sand
and
the
roads
every
garden
wall
every
window
that
looked
seaward
was
crowded
with
gazers
but
it
was
a
wonderfully
quiet
crowd
or
seemed
so
at
least
for
the
noise
of
the
wind
and
the
waves
filled
the
whole
vault
and
what
was
spoken
was
heard
only
in
the
ear
to
which
it
was
spoken
when
we
came
amongst
them
we
heard
only
a
murmur
as
of
more
articulated
confusion
one
turn
and
we
saw
the
centre
of
strife
and
anxiety
the
heart
of
the
storm
that
filled
heaven
and
earth
upon
which
all
the
blasts
and
the
billows
broke
and
raved
out
there
in
the
moonlight
lay
a
mass
of
something
whose
place
was
discernible
by
the
flashing
of
the
waves
as
they
burst
over
it
she
was
far
above
mark
lay
nearer
the
village
by
a
furlong
than
the
spot
where
we
had
taken
our
last
dinner
on
the
shore
it
was
strange
to
think
that
yesterday
the
spot
lay
bare
to
human
feet
where
now
so
many
men
and
women
were
isolated
in
a
howling
waste
of
angry
waters
for
the
cry
of
women
came
plainly
to
our
ears
and
we
were
helpless
to
save
them
it
was
terrible
to
have
to
do
nothing
percivale
went
about
hurriedly
talking
to
this
one
and
that
one
as
if
he
still
thought
something
might
be
done
he
turned
to
me
do
try
walton
and
find
out
for
me
where
the
captain
of
the
i
turned
to
a
man
who
stood
at
my
elbow
and
asked
him
it
s
no
use
i
assure
you
sir
he
answered
no
boat
could
live
in
such
a
sea
it
would
be
throwing
away
the
men
s
do
you
know
where
the
captain
lives
percivale
asked
if
i
did
i
tell
you
it
is
of
no
are
you
the
captain
yourself
returned
percivale
what
is
that
to
you
he
answered
surly
now
i
know
my
own
the
same
moment
several
of
the
crowd
nearest
the
edge
of
the
water
made
a
simultaneous
rush
into
the
surf
and
laid
hold
of
something
which
as
they
returned
drawing
it
to
the
shore
i
saw
to
be
a
human
form
it
was
the
body
of
a
woman
alive
or
dead
i
could
not
tell
i
could
just
see
the
long
hair
hanging
from
the
head
which
itself
hung
backward
helplessly
as
they
bore
her
up
the
bank
i
saw
too
a
white
face
and
i
can
recall
no
more
run
percivale
i
said
and
fetch
turner
she
may
not
be
dead
i
can
t
answered
percivale
you
had
better
go
yourself
he
spoke
hurriedly
i
saw
he
must
have
some
reason
for
answering
me
so
abruptly
he
was
talking
to
a
young
fellow
whom
i
recognised
as
one
of
the
most
dissolute
in
the
village
and
just
as
i
turned
to
go
they
walked
away
together
i
sped
home
as
fast
as
i
could
it
was
easier
to
get
along
now
that
the
moon
shone
i
found
that
turner
had
given
connie
a
composing
draught
and
that
he
had
good
hopes
she
would
at
least
be
nothing
the
worse
for
the
marvellous
result
of
her
excitement
she
was
asleep
exhausted
and
her
mother
was
watching
by
her
side
it
seemed
strange
that
she
could
sleep
but
turner
said
it
was
the
safest
reaction
partly
however
occasioned
by
what
he
had
given
her
in
her
sleep
she
kept
on
talking
about
the
ship
we
hurried
back
to
see
if
anything
could
be
done
for
the
woman
as
we
went
up
the
side
of
the
canal
we
perceived
a
dark
body
meeting
us
the
clouds
had
again
obscured
though
not
quite
hidden
the
moon
and
we
could
not
at
first
make
out
what
it
was
when
we
came
nearer
it
showed
itself
a
body
of
men
hauling
something
along
yes
it
was
the
afloat
on
the
troubled
waves
of
the
canal
each
man
seated
in
his
own
place
his
hands
quiet
upon
his
oar
his
braced
about
him
his
feet
out
before
him
ready
to
pull
the
moment
they
should
pass
beyond
the
broken
gates
of
the
lock
out
on
the
awful
tossing
of
the
waves
they
sat
very
silent
and
the
men
on
the
path
towed
them
swiftly
along
the
moon
uncovered
her
face
for
a
moment
and
shone
upon
the
faces
of
two
of
the
rowers
percivale
joe
i
cried
all
right
sir
said
joe
does
your
wife
know
of
it
joe
i
almost
gasped
to
be
sure
answered
joe
it
s
the
first
chance
i
ve
had
of
returning
thanks
for
her
please
god
i
shall
see
her
again
that
s
good
joe
trust
in
god
my
men
whether
you
sink
or
ay
ay
sir
they
answered
as
one
man
this
is
your
doing
percivale
i
said
turning
and
walking
alongside
of
the
boat
for
a
little
way
it
s
more
jim
allen
s
said
percivale
if
i
hadn
t
got
a
hold
of
him
i
couldn
t
have
done
god
bless
you
jim
allen
i
said
you
ll
be
a
better
man
after
this
i
donnow
sir
returned
jim
cheerily
it
s
harder
work
than
pulling
an
the
captain
himself
was
on
board
percivale
having
persuaded
jim
allen
the
two
had
gone
about
in
the
crowd
seeking
proselytes
in
a
wonderfully
short
space
they
had
found
almost
all
the
crew
each
fresh
one
picking
up
another
or
more
till
at
length
the
captain
protesting
against
the
folly
of
it
gave
in
and
once
having
yielded
was
like
a
true
englishman
as
much
in
earnest
as
any
of
them
the
places
of
two
who
were
missing
were
supplied
by
percivale
and
joe
the
latter
of
whom
would
listen
to
no
remonstrance
i
ve
nothing
to
lose
percivale
had
said
you
have
a
young
wife
i
ve
everything
to
win
joe
had
returned
the
only
thing
that
makes
me
feel
a
bit
over
it
is
that
i
m
afraid
it
s
not
my
duty
that
drives
me
to
it
but
the
praise
of
men
leastways
of
a
woman
what
would
aggy
think
of
me
if
i
was
to
let
them
drown
out
there
and
go
to
my
bed
and
sleep
i
must
very
well
joe
returned
percivale
i
daresay
you
are
right
you
can
row
of
course
i
can
row
hard
and
do
as
i
m
told
said
joe
all
right
said
percivale
come
this
i
heard
afterwards
we
were
now
hurrying
against
the
wind
towards
the
mouth
of
the
canal
some
twenty
men
hauling
on
the
the
critical
moment
would
be
in
the
clearing
of
the
gates
i
thought
some
parts
of
which
might
remain
swinging
but
they
encountered
no
difficulty
there
as
i
heard
afterwards
for
i
remembered
that
this
was
not
my
post
and
turned
again
to
follow
the
doctor
god
bless
you
my
men
i
said
and
left
them
they
gave
a
great
hurrah
and
sped
on
to
meet
their
fate
i
found
turner
in
the
little
whither
they
had
carried
the
body
the
woman
was
quite
dead
i
fear
it
is
an
emigrant
vessel
he
said
why
do
you
think
so
i
asked
in
some
consternation
come
and
look
at
the
body
he
said
it
was
that
of
a
woman
about
twenty
tall
and
finely
formed
the
face
was
very
handsome
but
it
did
not
need
the
evidence
of
the
hands
to
prove
that
she
was
one
of
our
sisters
who
have
to
labour
for
their
bread
what
should
such
a
girl
be
doing
on
board
ship
but
going
out
to
america
or
australia
to
her
lover
perhaps
said
turner
you
see
she
has
a
locket
on
her
neck
i
hope
nobody
will
dare
to
take
it
off
some
of
these
people
are
not
far
derived
from
those
who
thought
a
wreck
a
a
sound
of
many
feet
was
at
the
door
just
as
we
turned
to
leave
the
house
they
were
bringing
another
body
that
of
an
elderly
woman
dead
quite
dead
turner
had
ceased
examining
her
and
we
were
going
out
together
when
through
all
the
tumult
of
the
wind
and
waves
a
fierce
hiss
vindictive
wrathful
tore
the
air
over
our
heads
far
up
seawards
something
like
a
fiery
snake
shot
from
the
high
ground
on
the
right
side
of
the
bay
over
the
vessel
and
into
the
water
beyond
it
thank
god
that
s
the
coastguard
i
cried
we
rushed
through
the
village
and
up
on
the
heights
where
they
had
planted
their
apparatus
a
little
crowd
surrounded
them
how
dismal
the
sea
looked
in
the
struggling
moonlight
i
felt
as
if
i
were
wandering
in
the
mazes
of
an
evil
dream
but
when
i
approached
the
cliff
and
saw
down
below
the
great
mass
of
the
vessel
s
hulk
with
the
waves
breaking
every
moment
upon
her
side
i
felt
the
reality
awful
indeed
now
and
then
there
would
come
a
kind
of
lull
in
the
wild
sequence
of
rolling
waters
and
then
i
fancied
for
a
moment
that
i
saw
how
she
rocked
on
the
bottom
her
masts
had
all
gone
by
the
board
and
a
perfect
chaos
of
cordage
floated
and
swung
in
the
waves
that
broke
over
her
but
her
bowsprit
remained
entire
and
shot
out
into
the
foamy
dark
crowded
with
human
beings
the
first
rocket
had
missed
they
were
preparing
to
fire
another
roxton
stood
with
his
telescope
in
his
hand
ready
to
watch
the
result
this
is
a
terrible
job
sir
he
said
when
i
approached
him
i
doubt
if
we
shall
save
one
of
there
s
the
i
cried
as
a
dark
spot
appeared
on
the
waters
approaching
the
vessel
from
the
other
side
the
he
returned
with
contempt
you
don
t
mean
to
say
they
ve
got
out
she
ll
only
add
to
the
mischief
we
ll
have
to
save
her
she
was
still
some
way
from
the
vessel
and
in
comparatively
smooth
water
but
between
her
and
the
hull
the
sea
raved
in
madness
the
billows
rode
over
each
other
in
pursuit
as
it
seemed
of
some
invisible
prey
another
hiss
as
of
concentrated
hatred
and
the
second
rocket
was
shooting
its
parabola
through
the
dusky
air
roxton
raised
his
telescope
to
his
eye
the
same
moment
over
her
starn
he
cried
there
s
a
fellow
getting
down
from
the
to
run
stop
stop
he
shouted
involuntarily
there
s
an
awful
wave
on
your
his
voice
was
swallowed
in
the
roaring
of
the
storm
i
fancied
i
could
distinguish
a
dark
something
shoot
from
the
bows
towards
the
stern
but
the
huge
wave
fell
upon
the
wreck
the
same
moment
roxton
exclaimed
so
coolly
as
to
amaze
me
forgetting
how
men
must
come
to
regard
familiar
things
without
discomposure
he
s
gone
i
said
so
the
next
ll
have
better
luck
i
that
man
came
ashore
alive
though
all
were
forward
of
the
foremast
the
bowsprit
when
i
looked
through
roxton
s
telescope
was
shapeless
as
with
a
swarm
of
bees
now
and
then
a
single
shriek
rose
upon
the
wild
air
but
now
my
attention
was
fixed
on
the
she
had
got
into
the
wildest
of
the
broken
water
at
one
moment
she
was
down
in
a
huge
cleft
the
next
balanced
like
a
beam
on
the
of
a
wave
tossed
about
hither
and
thither
as
if
the
waves
delighted
in
mocking
the
rudder
but
hitherto
she
had
shipped
no
water
i
am
here
drawing
upon
the
information
i
have
since
received
but
i
did
see
how
a
huge
wave
following
close
upon
the
back
of
that
on
which
she
floated
rushed
towered
up
over
her
toppled
and
fell
upon
the
with
tons
of
water
the
moon
was
shining
brightly
enough
to
show
this
with
tolerable
distinctness
the
boat
vanished
the
next
moment
there
she
was
floating
helplessly
about
like
a
living
thing
stunned
by
the
blow
of
the
falling
wave
the
struggle
was
over
as
far
as
i
could
see
every
man
was
in
his
place
but
the
boat
drifted
away
before
the
storm
and
the
men
let
her
drift
were
they
all
killed
as
they
sat
i
thought
of
my
wynnie
and
turned
to
roxton
that
wave
has
done
for
them
he
said
i
told
you
it
was
no
use
there
they
but
what
is
the
matter
i
asked
the
men
are
sitting
every
man
in
his
i
think
so
he
answered
two
were
swept
overboard
but
they
caught
the
ropes
and
got
in
again
but
don
t
you
see
they
have
no
oars
that
wave
had
broken
every
one
of
them
off
at
the
rowlocks
and
now
they
were
as
helpless
as
a
sponge
i
turned
and
ran
before
i
reached
the
brow
of
the
hill
another
rocket
was
fired
and
fell
wide
shorewards
partly
because
the
wind
blew
with
fresh
fury
at
the
very
moment
i
heard
roxton
say
she
s
breaking
up
it
s
no
use
that
last
did
for
her
but
i
hurried
off
for
the
other
side
of
the
bay
to
see
what
became
of
the
i
heard
a
great
cry
from
the
vessel
as
i
reached
the
brow
of
the
hill
and
turned
for
a
parting
glance
the
dark
mass
had
vanished
and
the
waves
were
rushing
at
will
over
the
space
when
i
got
to
the
shore
the
crowd
was
less
many
were
running
like
myself
towards
the
other
side
anxious
about
the
i
hastened
after
them
for
percivale
and
joe
filled
my
heart
they
led
the
way
to
the
little
beach
in
front
of
the
parsonage
it
would
be
well
for
the
crew
if
they
were
driven
ashore
there
for
it
was
the
only
spot
where
they
could
escape
being
dashed
on
rocks
there
was
a
crowd
before
the
a
bustle
and
great
confusion
of
speech
the
people
men
and
women
boys
and
girls
were
all
gathered
about
the
crew
of
the
which
already
lay
as
if
it
knew
of
nothing
but
repose
on
the
grass
within
percivale
i
cried
making
my
way
through
the
crowd
there
was
no
answer
joe
harper
i
cried
again
searching
with
eager
eyes
amongst
the
crew
to
whom
everybody
was
talking
still
there
was
no
answer
and
from
the
disjointed
phrases
i
heard
i
could
gather
nothing
all
at
once
i
saw
wynnie
looking
over
the
wall
despair
in
her
face
her
wide
eyes
searching
wildly
through
the
crowd
i
could
not
look
at
her
till
i
knew
the
worst
the
captain
was
talking
to
old
coombes
i
went
up
to
him
as
soon
as
he
saw
me
he
gave
me
his
attention
where
is
percivale
i
asked
with
all
the
calmness
i
could
assume
he
took
me
by
the
arm
and
drew
me
out
of
the
crowd
nearer
to
the
waves
and
a
little
nearer
to
the
mouth
of
the
canal
the
tide
had
fallen
considerably
else
there
would
not
have
been
narrow
as
it
was
which
the
people
now
occupied
he
pointed
in
the
direction
of
the
if
you
mean
the
stranger
gentleman
and
joe
harper
the
blacksmith
i
interposed
they
re
there
you
don
t
mean
those
two
just
those
two
are
drowned
i
said
no
sir
i
don
t
say
that
but
god
knows
they
have
little
i
could
not
help
thinking
that
god
might
know
they
were
not
in
the
smallest
danger
but
i
only
begged
him
to
tell
me
where
they
were
do
you
see
that
schooner
there
just
between
you
and
the
no
i
answered
i
can
see
nothing
stay
i
fancy
i
can
but
i
am
always
ready
to
fancy
i
see
a
thing
when
i
am
told
it
is
there
i
can
t
say
i
see
i
can
though
the
gentleman
you
mean
and
joe
harper
too
are
i
believe
on
board
of
that
is
she
aground
o
dear
no
sir
she
s
a
light
craft
and
can
swim
there
well
enough
if
she
d
been
aground
she
d
ha
been
ashore
in
pieces
hours
ago
but
whether
she
ll
ride
it
out
god
only
knows
as
i
said
how
ever
did
they
get
aboard
of
her
i
never
saw
her
from
the
heights
you
were
all
taken
up
by
the
ship
ashore
you
see
sir
and
she
don
t
make
much
show
in
this
light
but
there
she
is
and
they
re
aboard
of
her
and
this
is
how
it
he
went
on
to
give
me
his
part
of
the
story
but
i
will
now
give
the
whole
of
it
myself
as
i
have
gathered
and
pieced
it
together
two
men
had
been
swept
overboard
as
roxton
said
one
of
them
was
percivale
but
they
had
both
got
on
board
again
to
drift
oarless
with
the
rest
now
in
a
windless
valley
now
aloft
on
a
hill
of
water
away
towards
a
goal
they
knew
not
neither
had
chosen
and
which
yet
they
could
by
no
means
avoid
a
little
out
of
the
full
force
of
the
current
and
not
far
from
the
channel
of
the
small
stream
which
when
the
tide
was
out
flowed
across
the
sands
nearly
from
the
canal
gates
to
the
lay
a
little
schooner
belonging
to
a
neighbouring
port
boscastle
i
think
which
caught
in
the
storm
had
been
driven
into
the
bay
when
it
was
almost
dark
some
considerable
time
before
the
great
ship
the
master
however
knew
the
ground
well
the
current
carried
him
a
little
out
of
the
wind
and
would
have
thrown
him
upon
the
rocks
next
but
he
managed
to
drop
anchor
just
in
time
and
the
cable
held
and
there
the
little
schooner
hung
in
the
skirts
of
the
storm
with
the
jagged
teeth
of
the
rocks
within
an
arrow
flight
in
the
excitement
of
the
great
wreck
no
one
had
observed
the
danger
of
the
little
coasting
bird
if
the
cable
held
till
the
tide
went
down
and
the
anchor
did
not
drag
she
would
be
safe
if
not
she
must
be
dashed
to
pieces
in
the
schooner
were
two
men
and
a
boy
two
men
had
been
washed
overboard
an
hour
or
so
before
they
reached
the
bay
when
they
had
dropped
their
anchor
they
lay
down
exhausted
on
the
deck
indeed
they
were
so
worn
out
that
they
had
been
unable
to
drop
their
sheet
anchor
and
were
holding
on
only
by
their
best
bower
had
they
not
been
a
good
deal
out
of
the
wind
this
would
have
been
useless
even
if
it
held
she
was
in
danger
of
having
her
bottom
stove
in
by
bumping
against
the
sands
as
the
tide
went
out
but
that
they
had
not
to
think
of
yet
the
moment
they
lay
down
they
fell
fast
asleep
in
the
middle
of
the
storm
while
they
slept
it
increased
in
violence
suddenly
one
of
them
awoke
and
thought
he
saw
a
vision
of
angels
for
over
his
head
faces
looked
down
upon
him
from
the
air
that
is
from
the
top
of
a
great
wave
the
same
moment
he
heard
a
voice
two
of
the
angels
dropped
on
the
deck
beside
him
and
the
rest
vanished
those
angels
were
percivale
and
joe
and
angels
they
were
for
they
came
just
in
time
as
all
angels
do
never
a
moment
too
soon
or
a
moment
too
late
the
schooner
dragging
her
anchor
this
was
soon
plain
even
to
the
less
experienced
eyes
of
the
said
angels
but
it
did
not
take
them
many
minutes
now
to
drop
their
strongest
anchor
and
they
were
soon
riding
in
perfect
safety
for
some
time
to
come
one
of
the
two
men
was
the
son
of
old
coombes
the
sexton
who
was
engaged
to
marry
the
girl
i
have
spoken
of
in
the
end
of
the
fourth
chapter
in
the
second
volume
percivale
s
account
of
the
matter
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
was
that
as
they
drifted
helplessly
along
he
suddenly
saw
from
the
top
of
a
huge
wave
the
little
vessel
below
him
they
were
in
fact
almost
upon
the
rigging
the
wave
on
which
they
rode
swept
the
of
the
schooner
percivale
says
the
captain
of
the
lifeboat
called
out
aboard
the
captain
said
he
remembered
nothing
of
the
sort
if
he
did
he
must
have
meant
it
for
the
men
on
the
schooner
to
get
on
board
the
lifeboat
percivale
however
who
had
a
most
chivalrous
ought
i
not
to
say
christian
notion
of
obedience
fancying
the
captain
meant
them
to
board
the
schooner
sprang
at
her
thereupon
the
wave
sweeping
them
along
the
schooner
s
side
joe
sprang
at
the
and
they
dropped
on
the
deck
together
but
although
my
reader
is
at
ease
about
their
fate
we
who
were
in
the
affair
were
anything
but
easy
at
the
time
corresponding
to
this
point
of
the
narrative
it
was
a
terrible
night
we
passed
through
when
i
returned
which
was
almost
instantly
for
i
could
do
nothing
by
staring
out
in
the
direction
of
the
schooner
i
found
that
the
crowd
was
nearly
gone
one
little
group
alone
remained
behind
the
centre
of
which
was
a
woman
wynnie
had
disappeared
the
woman
who
remained
behind
was
agnes
harper
the
moon
shone
out
clear
as
i
approached
the
group
indeed
the
clouds
were
and
drifting
away
off
the
heavens
the
storm
had
raved
out
its
business
and
was
departing
into
the
past
agnes
i
said
yes
sir
she
answered
and
looked
up
as
if
waiting
for
a
command
there
was
no
colour
in
her
cheeks
or
in
her
lips
at
least
it
seemed
so
in
the
moonlight
only
in
her
eyes
but
she
was
perfectly
calm
she
was
leaning
against
the
low
wall
with
her
hands
clasped
but
hanging
quietly
down
before
her
the
storm
is
agnes
i
said
yes
sir
she
answered
in
the
same
still
tone
then
after
just
a
moment
s
pause
she
spoke
out
of
her
heart
joe
s
at
his
duty
sir
i
have
given
the
utterance
a
point
of
interrogation
whether
she
meant
that
point
i
am
not
quite
sure
indubitably
i
returned
i
have
such
faith
in
joe
that
i
should
be
sure
of
that
in
any
case
at
all
events
he
s
not
taking
care
of
his
own
life
and
if
one
is
to
go
wrong
i
would
ten
thousand
times
rather
err
on
that
side
but
i
am
sure
joe
has
been
doing
right
and
nothing
then
there
s
nothing
to
be
said
sir
is
there
she
returned
with
a
sigh
that
sounded
as
of
relief
i
presume
some
of
the
surrounding
condolers
had
been
giving
her
job
s
comfort
by
blaming
her
husband
do
you
remember
agnes
what
the
lord
said
to
his
mother
when
she
reproached
him
with
having
left
her
and
his
father
i
can
t
remember
anything
at
this
moment
sir
was
her
touching
answer
then
i
will
tell
you
he
said
why
did
you
look
for
me
didn
t
you
know
that
i
must
be
about
something
my
father
had
given
me
to
do
now
joe
was
and
is
about
his
father
s
business
and
you
must
not
be
anxious
about
him
there
could
be
no
better
reason
for
not
being
agnes
was
a
very
quiet
woman
when
without
a
word
she
took
my
hand
and
kissed
it
i
felt
what
a
depth
there
was
in
the
feeling
she
could
not
utter
i
did
not
withdraw
my
hand
for
i
knew
that
would
be
to
rebuke
her
love
for
joe
will
you
come
in
and
wait
i
said
indefinitely
no
thank
you
sir
i
must
go
to
my
mother
god
will
look
after
joe
won
t
he
sir
as
sure
as
there
is
a
god
agnes
i
said
and
she
went
away
without
another
word
i
put
my
hand
on
the
top
of
the
wall
and
jumped
over
i
started
back
with
terror
for
i
had
almost
alighted
on
the
body
of
a
woman
lying
there
the
first
insane
suggestion
was
that
it
had
been
cast
ashore
but
the
next
moment
i
knew
that
it
was
my
own
wynnie
she
had
not
even
fainted
she
was
lying
with
her
handkerchief
stuffed
into
her
mouth
to
keep
her
from
screaming
when
i
uttered
her
name
she
rose
and
without
looking
at
me
walked
away
towards
the
house
i
followed
she
went
straight
to
her
own
room
and
shut
the
door
i
went
to
find
her
mother
she
was
with
connie
who
was
now
awake
lying
pale
and
frightened
i
told
ethelwyn
that
percivale
and
joe
were
on
board
the
little
schooner
which
was
holding
on
by
her
anchor
that
wynnie
was
in
terror
about
percivale
that
i
had
found
her
lying
on
the
wet
grass
and
that
she
must
get
her
into
a
warm
bath
and
to
bed
we
went
together
to
her
room
she
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
with
her
hands
pressed
against
her
temples
wynnie
i
said
our
friends
are
not
drowned
i
think
you
will
see
them
quite
safe
in
the
morning
pray
to
god
for
she
did
not
hear
a
word
leave
her
with
me
said
ethelwyn
proceeding
to
undress
her
and
tell
nurse
to
bring
up
the
large
bath
there
is
plenty
of
hot
water
in
the
boiler
i
gave
orders
to
that
effect
not
knowing
what
might
wynnie
shuddered
as
her
mother
said
this
but
i
waited
no
longer
for
when
ethelwyn
spoke
everyone
felt
her
authority
i
obeyed
her
and
then
went
to
connie
s
room
do
you
mind
being
left
alone
a
little
while
i
asked
her
no
papa
only
are
they
all
drowned
she
said
with
a
shudder
i
hope
not
my
dear
but
be
sure
of
the
mercy
of
god
whatever
you
fear
you
must
rest
in
him
my
love
for
he
is
life
and
will
conquer
death
both
in
the
soul
and
in
the
i
was
not
thinking
of
myself
i
know
that
my
dear
but
god
is
thinking
of
you
and
every
creature
that
he
has
made
and
for
our
sakes
you
must
be
quiet
in
heart
that
you
may
get
better
and
be
able
to
help
i
will
try
papa
she
said
and
turning
slowly
on
her
side
she
lay
quite
still
dora
and
the
boys
were
all
fast
asleep
for
it
was
very
late
i
can
not
however
say
what
hour
it
was
telling
nurse
to
be
on
the
watch
because
connie
was
alone
i
went
again
to
the
beach
i
called
first
however
to
inquire
after
agnes
i
found
her
quite
composed
sitting
with
her
parents
by
the
fire
none
of
them
doing
anything
scarcely
speaking
only
listening
intently
to
the
sounds
of
the
storm
now
beginning
to
die
away
i
next
went
to
the
place
where
i
had
left
turner
five
bodies
lay
there
and
he
was
busy
with
a
sixth
the
surgeon
of
the
place
was
with
him
and
they
quite
expected
to
recover
this
man
i
then
went
down
to
the
sands
an
officer
of
the
revenue
was
taking
charge
of
all
that
came
ashore
chests
and
bales
and
everything
for
a
week
the
sea
went
on
casting
out
the
fragments
of
that
which
she
had
destroyed
i
have
heard
that
for
years
after
the
shifting
of
the
sands
would
now
and
then
discover
things
buried
that
night
by
the
waves
all
the
next
day
the
bodies
kept
coming
ashore
some
peaceful
as
in
sleep
others
broken
and
mutilated
many
were
cast
upon
other
parts
of
the
coast
some
four
or
five
only
all
men
were
recovered
it
was
strange
to
me
how
i
got
used
to
it
the
first
horror
over
the
cry
that
yet
another
body
had
come
awoke
only
a
gentle
pity
no
more
dismay
or
shuddering
but
finding
i
could
be
of
no
use
i
did
not
wait
longer
than
just
till
the
morning
began
to
dawn
with
a
pale
ghastly
light
over
the
seething
raging
sea
for
the
sea
raged
on
although
the
wind
had
gone
down
there
were
many
strong
men
about
with
two
surgeons
and
all
the
coastguard
who
were
well
accustomed
to
similar
though
not
such
extensive
destruction
the
houses
along
the
shore
were
at
the
disposal
of
any
who
wanted
aid
the
parsonage
was
at
some
distance
and
i
confess
that
when
i
thought
of
the
state
of
my
daughters
as
well
as
remembered
former
influences
upon
my
wife
i
was
very
glad
to
think
there
was
no
necessity
for
carrying
thither
any
of
those
whom
the
waves
cast
on
the
shore
when
i
reached
home
and
found
wynnie
quieter
and
connie
again
asleep
i
walked
out
along
our
own
downs
till
i
came
whence
i
could
see
the
little
schooner
still
safe
at
anchor
from
her
position
i
concluded
correctly
as
i
found
afterwards
that
they
had
let
out
her
cable
far
enough
to
allow
her
to
reach
the
bed
of
the
little
stream
where
the
tide
would
leave
her
more
gently
she
was
clearly
out
of
all
danger
now
and
if
percivale
and
joe
had
got
safe
on
board
of
her
we
might
confidently
expect
to
see
them
before
many
hours
were
passed
i
went
home
with
the
good
news
for
a
few
moments
i
doubted
whether
i
should
tell
wynnie
for
i
could
not
know
with
any
certainty
that
percivale
was
in
the
schooner
but
presently
i
recalled
former
conclusions
to
the
effect
that
we
have
no
right
to
modify
god
s
facts
for
fear
of
what
may
be
to
come
a
little
hope
founded
on
a
present
appearance
even
if
that
hope
should
never
be
realised
may
be
the
very
means
of
enabling
a
soul
to
bear
the
weight
of
a
sorrow
past
the
point
at
which
it
would
otherwise
break
down
i
would
therefore
tell
wynnie
and
let
her
share
my
expectation
of
deliverance
i
think
she
had
been
for
when
i
entered
her
room
she
started
up
in
a
sitting
posture
looking
wild
and
putting
her
hands
to
her
head
i
have
brought
you
good
news
wynnie
i
said
i
have
been
out
on
the
downs
and
there
is
light
enough
now
to
see
that
the
little
schooner
is
quite
what
schooner
she
asked
listlessly
and
lay
down
again
her
eyes
still
staring
awfully
unappeased
why
the
schooner
they
say
percivale
got
on
he
isn
t
drowned
then
she
cried
with
a
choking
voice
and
put
her
hands
to
her
face
and
burst
into
tears
and
sobs
wynnie
i
said
look
what
your
faithlessness
brings
upon
you
everybody
but
you
has
known
all
night
that
percivale
and
joe
harper
are
probably
quite
safe
they
may
be
ashore
in
a
couple
of
but
you
don
t
know
it
he
may
be
drowned
of
course
there
is
room
for
doubt
but
none
for
despair
see
what
a
poor
helpless
creature
hopelessness
makes
but
how
can
i
help
it
papa
she
asked
piteously
i
am
made
but
as
she
spoke
the
dawn
was
clear
upon
the
height
of
her
forehead
you
are
not
made
yet
as
i
am
always
telling
you
and
god
has
ordained
that
you
shall
have
a
hand
in
your
own
making
you
have
to
consent
to
desire
that
what
you
know
for
a
fault
shall
be
set
right
by
his
loving
will
and
i
don
t
know
god
ah
my
dear
that
is
where
it
all
lies
you
do
not
know
him
or
you
would
never
be
without
but
what
am
i
to
do
to
know
him
she
asked
rising
on
her
elbow
the
saving
power
of
hope
was
already
working
in
her
she
was
once
more
turning
her
face
towards
the
life
read
as
you
have
never
read
before
about
christ
jesus
my
love
read
with
the
express
object
of
finding
out
what
god
is
like
that
you
may
know
him
and
may
trust
him
and
now
give
yourself
to
him
and
he
will
give
you
what
are
we
to
do
i
said
to
my
wife
if
percivale
continue
silent
for
even
if
he
be
in
love
with
her
i
doubt
if
he
will
we
must
leave
all
that
harry
she
answered
she
was
turning
on
myself
the
counsel
i
had
been
giving
wynnie
it
is
strange
how
easily
we
can
tell
our
brother
what
he
ought
to
do
and
yet
when
the
case
comes
to
be
our
own
do
precisely
as
we
had
rebuked
him
for
doing
i
lay
down
and
fell
fast
asleep
chapter
ix
the
funeral
it
was
a
lovely
morning
when
i
woke
once
more
the
sun
was
flashing
back
from
the
sea
which
was
still
tossing
but
no
longer
furiously
only
as
if
it
wanted
to
turn
itself
every
way
to
flash
the
sunlight
about
the
madness
of
the
night
was
over
and
gone
the
light
was
abroad
and
the
world
was
rejoicing
when
i
reached
the
which
afforded
the
best
outlook
over
the
shore
there
was
the
schooner
lying
dry
on
the
sands
her
two
cables
and
anchors
stretching
out
yards
behind
her
but
half
way
between
the
two
sides
of
the
bay
rose
a
mass
of
something
shapeless
drifted
over
with
sand
it
was
all
that
remained
together
of
the
great
ship
that
had
the
day
before
swept
over
the
waters
like
a
live
thing
with
wings
of
all
the
works
of
man
s
hands
the
nearest
to
the
shape
and
sign
of
life
the
wind
had
ceased
altogether
only
now
and
then
a
little
breeze
arose
which
murmured
i
am
very
sorry
and
lay
down
again
and
i
knew
that
in
the
houses
on
the
shore
dead
men
and
women
were
lying
i
went
down
to
the
the
three
children
were
busy
at
their
breakfast
but
neither
wife
daughter
nor
visitor
had
yet
appeared
i
made
a
hurried
meal
and
was
just
rising
to
go
and
inquire
further
into
the
events
of
the
night
when
the
door
opened
and
in
walked
percivale
looking
very
solemn
but
in
perfect
health
and
i
grasped
his
hand
warmly
thank
god
i
said
that
you
are
returned
to
us
i
doubt
if
that
is
much
to
give
thanks
for
he
said
we
are
the
judges
of
that
i
rejoined
tell
me
all
about
while
he
was
narrating
the
events
i
have
already
communicated
wynnie
entered
she
started
turned
pale
and
then
very
red
and
for
a
moment
hesitated
in
the
doorway
here
is
another
to
rejoice
at
your
safety
percivale
i
said
thereupon
he
stepped
forward
to
meet
her
and
she
gave
him
her
hand
with
an
emotion
so
evident
that
i
felt
a
little
distressed
why
i
could
not
easily
have
told
for
she
looked
most
charming
in
the
act
more
lovely
than
i
had
ever
seen
her
her
beauty
was
unconsciously
praising
god
and
her
heart
would
soon
praise
him
too
but
percivale
was
a
modest
man
and
i
think
attributed
her
emotion
to
the
fact
that
he
had
been
in
danger
in
the
way
of
duty
a
fact
sufficient
to
move
the
heart
of
any
good
woman
she
sat
down
and
began
to
busy
herself
with
the
teapot
her
hand
trembled
i
requested
percivale
to
begin
his
story
once
more
and
he
evidently
enjoyed
recounting
to
her
the
adventures
of
the
night
i
asked
him
to
sit
down
and
have
a
second
breakfast
while
i
went
into
the
village
whereto
he
seemed
nothing
loth
as
i
crossed
the
floor
of
the
old
mill
to
see
how
joe
was
the
head
of
the
sexton
appeared
emerging
from
it
he
looked
full
of
weighty
solemn
business
bidding
me
he
turned
to
the
corner
where
his
tools
lay
and
proceeded
to
shoulder
spade
and
pickaxe
ah
coombes
you
ll
want
them
i
said
a
good
many
o
my
people
be
come
all
at
once
you
see
sir
he
returned
i
shall
have
enough
ado
to
make
em
all
comfortable
but
you
must
get
help
you
know
you
can
never
make
them
all
comfortable
yourself
we
ll
see
what
i
can
do
he
returned
i
ben
t
a
bit
willin
to
let
no
one
do
my
work
for
me
i
do
assure
you
how
many
are
there
wanting
your
services
i
asked
there
be
fifteen
of
them
now
and
there
be
more
i
don
t
doubt
on
the
but
you
won
t
think
of
making
separate
graves
for
them
all
i
said
they
died
together
let
them
lie
the
old
man
set
down
his
tools
and
looked
me
in
the
face
with
indignation
the
face
was
so
honest
and
old
that
without
feeling
i
had
deserved
it
i
yet
felt
the
rebuke
how
would
you
like
sir
he
said
at
length
to
be
put
in
the
same
bed
with
a
lot
of
people
you
didn
t
know
nothing
about
i
knew
the
old
man
s
way
and
that
any
argument
which
denied
the
premiss
of
his
peculiar
fancy
was
worse
than
thrown
away
upon
him
i
therefore
ventured
no
farther
than
to
say
that
i
had
heard
death
was
a
leveller
that
be
very
true
and
mayhap
they
mightn
t
think
of
it
after
they
d
been
down
awhile
six
weeks
mayhap
or
so
but
anyhow
it
can
t
be
comfortable
for
em
poor
things
one
on
em
be
a
baby
i
daresay
he
d
rather
lie
with
his
mother
the
doctor
he
say
one
o
the
women
be
a
mother
i
don
t
know
he
went
on
reflectively
whether
she
be
the
baby
s
own
mother
but
i
daresay
neither
o
them
ll
mind
it
if
i
take
it
for
granted
and
lay
em
down
together
so
that
s
one
bed
one
thing
was
clear
that
the
old
man
could
not
dig
fourteen
graves
within
the
needful
time
but
i
would
not
interfere
with
his
office
in
the
church
having
no
reason
to
doubt
that
he
would
perform
its
duties
to
perfection
he
shouldered
his
tools
again
and
walked
out
i
descended
the
stair
thinking
to
see
joe
but
there
was
no
one
there
but
the
old
woman
where
are
joe
and
agnes
i
asked
you
see
sir
joe
had
promised
a
little
job
of
work
to
be
ready
and
so
he
couldn
t
stop
he
did
say
agnes
needn
t
go
with
him
but
she
thought
she
couldn
t
part
with
him
so
soon
you
see
she
had
received
him
from
the
dead
raised
to
life
again
i
said
it
was
most
natural
but
what
a
fine
fellow
joe
is
nothing
will
make
him
neglect
his
work
i
tried
to
get
him
to
stop
sir
saying
he
had
done
quite
enough
last
night
for
all
next
day
but
he
told
me
it
was
his
business
to
get
the
tire
put
on
farmer
wheatstone
s
just
as
much
as
it
was
his
business
to
go
in
the
yesterday
so
he
would
go
and
aggy
wouldn
t
stay
fine
fellow
joe
i
said
and
took
my
leave
as
i
drew
near
the
village
i
heard
the
sound
of
hammering
and
sawing
and
apparently
everything
at
once
in
the
way
of
joinery
they
were
making
the
coffins
in
the
joiners
shops
of
which
there
were
two
in
the
place
i
do
not
like
coffins
they
seem
to
me
relics
of
barbarism
if
i
had
my
way
i
would
have
the
old
thing
decently
wound
in
a
fair
linen
cloth
and
so
laid
in
the
bosom
of
the
earth
whence
it
was
taken
i
would
have
it
vanish
not
merely
from
the
world
of
vision
but
from
the
world
of
form
as
soon
as
may
be
the
embrace
of
the
fine
mould
seems
to
me
comforting
in
the
vague
foolish
fancy
that
will
sometimes
emerge
from
the
froth
of
reverie
i
mean
of
subdued
consciousness
remaining
in
the
outworn
frame
but
the
coffin
is
altogether
and
vilely
repellent
of
this
however
enough
i
hate
even
the
shadow
of
sentiment
though
some
of
my
readers
who
may
not
yet
have
learned
to
distinguish
between
sentiment
and
feeling
may
wonder
how
i
dare
to
utter
such
a
barbarism
i
went
to
the
house
of
the
county
magistrate
hard
by
for
i
thought
something
might
have
to
be
done
in
which
i
had
a
share
i
found
that
he
had
sent
a
notice
of
the
loss
of
the
vessel
to
the
liverpool
papers
requesting
those
who
might
wish
to
identify
or
claim
any
of
the
bodies
to
appear
within
four
days
at
kilkhaven
this
threw
the
last
upon
saturday
and
before
the
end
of
the
week
it
was
clear
that
they
must
not
remain
above
ground
over
sunday
i
therefore
arranged
that
they
should
be
buried
late
on
the
saturday
night
on
the
friday
morning
a
young
woman
and
an
old
man
unknown
to
each
other
arrived
by
the
coach
from
barnstaple
they
had
come
to
see
the
last
of
their
friends
in
this
world
to
look
if
they
might
at
the
shadow
left
behind
by
the
departing
soul
for
as
the
shadow
of
any
object
remains
a
moment
upon
the
magic
curtain
of
the
eye
after
the
object
itself
has
gone
so
the
shadow
of
the
soul
namely
the
body
lingers
a
moment
upon
the
earth
after
the
object
itself
has
gone
to
the
high
it
was
well
to
see
with
what
a
sober
sorrow
the
dignified
little
old
man
bore
his
grief
it
was
as
if
he
felt
that
the
loss
of
his
son
was
only
for
a
moment
but
the
young
woman
had
taken
on
the
hue
of
the
corpse
she
came
to
seek
her
eyes
were
sunken
as
if
with
the
weight
of
the
light
she
cared
not
for
and
her
cheeks
had
already
pined
away
as
if
to
be
ready
for
the
grave
a
being
thus
emptied
of
its
glory
seized
and
possessed
my
thoughts
she
never
even
told
us
whom
she
came
seeking
and
after
one
involuntary
question
which
simply
received
no
answer
i
was
very
careful
not
even
to
approach
another
i
do
not
think
the
form
she
sought
was
there
and
she
may
have
gone
home
with
the
lingering
hope
to
cast
the
gray
aurora
of
a
doubtful
dawn
over
her
coming
days
that
after
all
that
one
had
escaped
on
the
friday
afternoon
with
the
approbation
of
the
magistrate
i
had
all
the
bodies
removed
to
the
church
some
in
their
coffins
others
on
stretchers
they
were
laid
in
front
of
the
in
the
evening
these
two
went
to
see
them
i
took
care
to
be
present
the
old
man
soon
found
his
son
i
was
at
his
elbow
as
he
walked
between
the
rows
of
the
dead
he
turned
to
me
and
said
quietly
that
s
him
sir
he
was
a
good
lad
god
rest
his
soul
he
s
with
his
mother
and
if
i
m
sorry
she
s
with
that
he
smiled
or
tried
to
smile
i
could
only
lay
my
hand
on
his
arm
to
let
him
know
that
i
understood
him
and
was
with
him
he
walked
out
of
the
church
sat
down
upon
a
stone
and
stared
at
the
mould
of
a
grave
in
front
of
him
what
was
passing
behind
those
eyes
god
only
knew
certainly
the
man
himself
did
not
know
our
lightest
thoughts
are
of
more
awful
significance
than
the
most
serious
of
us
can
imagine
for
the
young
woman
i
thought
she
left
the
church
with
a
little
light
in
her
eyes
but
she
had
said
nothing
alas
that
the
body
was
not
there
could
no
more
justify
her
than
milton
in
letting
her
frail
thoughts
dally
with
false
with
him
too
she
might
well
add
ay
me
whilst
thee
the
shores
and
sounding
seas
wash
far
but
god
had
them
in
his
teaching
and
all
i
could
do
was
to
ask
them
to
be
my
guests
till
the
funeral
and
the
following
sunday
were
over
to
this
they
kindly
consented
and
i
took
them
to
my
wife
who
received
them
like
herself
and
had
in
a
few
minutes
made
them
at
home
with
her
to
which
no
doubt
their
sorrow
tended
for
that
brings
out
the
relations
of
humanity
and
destroys
its
distinctions
the
next
morning
a
scotchman
of
a
very
decided
type
originally
from
aberdeen
but
resident
in
liverpool
appeared
seeking
the
form
of
his
daughter
i
had
arranged
that
whoever
came
should
be
brought
to
me
first
i
went
with
him
to
the
church
he
was
a
tall
gaunt
bony
man
with
long
arms
and
huge
hands
a
rugged
face
and
a
slow
ponderous
utterance
which
i
had
some
difficulty
in
understanding
he
treated
the
object
of
his
visit
with
a
certain
hardness
and
at
the
same
time
lightness
which
also
i
had
some
difficulty
in
understanding
you
want
to
see
the
i
said
and
hesitated
ow
ay
the
boadies
he
answered
she
winna
be
there
i
daursay
but
i
wad
jist
like
to
see
for
i
wadna
like
her
to
be
beeried
gin
sae
be
at
she
was
there
wi
oot
biddin
her
when
we
reached
the
church
i
opened
the
door
and
entered
an
awe
fell
upon
me
fresh
and
new
the
beautiful
church
had
become
a
tomb
solemn
grand
ancient
it
rose
as
a
memorial
of
the
dead
who
lay
in
peace
before
her
as
if
they
had
fled
thither
for
sanctuary
from
a
sea
of
troubles
and
i
thought
with
myself
will
the
time
ever
come
when
the
churches
shall
stand
as
the
tombs
of
holy
things
that
have
passed
away
when
christ
shall
have
rendered
up
the
kingdom
to
his
father
and
no
man
shall
need
to
teach
his
neighbour
or
his
brother
saying
know
the
lord
the
thought
passed
through
my
mind
and
vanished
as
i
led
my
companion
up
to
the
dead
he
glanced
at
one
and
another
and
passed
on
he
had
looked
at
ten
or
twelve
ere
he
stopped
gazing
on
the
face
of
the
beautiful
form
which
had
first
come
ashore
he
stooped
and
stroked
the
white
cheeks
taking
the
head
in
his
great
rough
hands
and
smoothed
the
brown
hair
tenderly
saying
as
if
he
had
quite
forgotten
that
she
was
dead
eh
maggie
hoo
cam
here
lass
then
as
if
for
the
first
time
the
reality
had
grown
comprehensible
he
put
his
hands
before
his
face
and
burst
into
tears
his
huge
frame
was
shaken
with
sobs
for
one
long
minute
while
i
stood
looking
on
with
awe
and
reverence
he
ceased
suddenly
pulled
a
blue
cotton
handkerchief
with
yellow
spots
on
it
i
see
it
now
from
his
pocket
rubbed
his
face
with
it
as
if
drying
it
with
a
towel
put
it
back
turned
and
said
without
looking
at
me
i
ll
awa
wouldn
t
you
like
a
piece
of
her
hair
i
asked
gin
ye
please
he
answered
gently
as
if
his
daughter
s
form
had
been
mine
now
and
her
hair
were
mine
to
give
by
the
vestry
door
sat
coombes
watching
the
dead
with
her
sweet
solemn
smile
and
her
constant
ministration
of
knitting
have
you
got
a
pair
of
scissors
there
coombes
i
asked
yes
to
be
sure
sir
she
answered
rising
and
lifting
a
huge
pair
by
the
string
suspending
them
from
her
waist
cut
off
a
nice
piece
of
this
beautiful
hair
i
said
she
lifted
the
lovely
head
chose
and
cut
off
a
long
piece
and
handed
it
respectfully
to
the
father
he
took
it
without
a
word
sat
down
on
the
step
before
the
and
began
to
smooth
out
the
wonderful
sleave
of
dusky
gold
it
was
indeed
beautiful
hair
as
he
drew
it
out
i
thought
it
must
be
a
yard
long
he
passed
his
big
fingers
through
and
through
it
but
tenderly
as
if
it
had
been
still
growing
on
the
live
lovely
head
stopping
every
moment
to
pick
out
the
bits
of
and
shells
and
shake
out
the
sand
that
had
been
wrought
into
its
mass
he
sat
thus
for
nearly
and
we
stood
looking
on
with
something
closely
akin
to
awe
at
length
he
folded
it
up
drew
from
his
pocket
an
old
black
leather
book
laid
it
carefully
in
the
innermost
pocket
and
rose
i
led
the
way
from
the
church
and
he
followed
me
outside
the
church
he
laid
his
hand
on
my
arm
and
said
groping
with
his
other
hand
in
his
she
ll
hae
putten
ye
to
some
expense
for
the
coffin
an
sic
we
ll

about
that

answered

no
company
for
come
and
show
me
in
which
of
these
graves
you
would
like
to
have
her
laid
i
said
he
yielded
and
followed
me
coombes
had
not
dug
many
spadefuls
before
he
saw
what
had
been
plain
enough
that
ten
such
men
as
he
could
not
dig
the
graves
in
time
but
there
was
plenty
of
help
to
be
had
from
the
village
and
the
neighbouring
farms
most
of
them
were
now
ready
but
a
good
many
men
were
still
at
work
the
brown
hillocks
lay
all
about
the
the
of
burrowing
death
the
stranger
looked
around
him
his
face
grew
critical
he
stepped
a
little
hither
and
thither
at
length
he
turned
to
me
and
said
i
wadna
like
to
be
greedy
but
gin
ye
wad
lat
her
lie
next
the
kirk
there

that
neuk
i

home
maggie
jamieson
frae
her
father
it
s
the
last
thing
i
can
gie
her
maybe
ye
micht
put
a
verse
o
scripter
aneath
t
ye
what
verse
would
you
like
he
thought
for
a
little
isna
there
a
text
that
says
the
deid
shall
hear
his
voice
yes
the
dead
shall
hear
the
voice
of
the
son
of
ay
that
s
it
weel
jist
put
that
they
canna
do
better
than
hear
his
voice
he
added
with
a
strange
mixture
of
scotch
ratiocination
i
led
the
way
home
and
he
accompanied
me
without
further
objection
or
apology
after
dinner
i
proposed
that
we
should
go
upon
the
downs
for
the
day
was
warm
and
bright
we
sat
on
the
grass
i
felt
that
i
could
not
talk
to
them
as
from
myself
i
knew
nothing
of
the
possible
gulfs
of
sorrow
in
their
hearts
to
me
their
forms
seemed
each
like
a
hill
in
whose
unseen
bosom
lay
a
cavern
of
dripping
waters
perhaps
with
a
subterranean
torrent
of
anguish
raving
through
its
hollows
and
tumbling
down
hidden
precipices
whose
voice
god
only
heard
and
god
only
could
still
this
daughter
though
from
her
face
i
did
not
think
it
have
gone
away
against
her
father
s
will
that
son
have
been
a
ne
at
home
how
could
i
tell
the
woman
be
looking
for
the
lover
that
had
forsaken
her
i
could
not
divine
i
would
speak
no
words
of
my
own
the
son
of
god
had
spoken
words
of
comfort
to
his
mourning
friends
when
he
was
the
present
god
and
they
were
the
forefront
of
humanity
i
would
read
some
of
the
words
he
spoke
from
them
the
human
nature
in
each
would
draw
what
comfort
it
could
i
took
my
new
testament
from
my
pocket
and
said
without
any
preamble
when
our
lord
was
going
to
die
he
knew
that
his
friends
loved
him
enough
to
be
very
wretched
about
it
he
knew
that
they
would
be
overwhelmed
for
a
time
with
trouble
he
knew
too
that
they
could
not
believe
the
glad
end
of
it
all
to
which
end
he
looked
across
the
awful
death
that
awaited
him
a
death
to
which
that
of
our
friends
in
the
wreck
was
ease
itself
i
will
just
read
to
you
what
he
i
read
from
the
fourteenth
to
the
seventeenth
chapter
of
john
s
gospel
i
knew
there
were
worlds
of
meaning
in
the
words
into
which
i
could
hardly
hope
any
of
them
would
enter
but
i
knew
likewise
that
the
best
things
are
just
those
from
which
the
humble
will
draw
the
truth
they
are
capable
of
seeing
therefore
i
read
as
for
myself
and
left
it
to
them
to
hear
for
themselves
nor
did
i
add
any
word
of
comment
fearful
of
darkening
counsel
by
words
without
knowledge
for
the
bible
is
awfully
set
against
what
is
not
wise
when
i
had
finished
i
closed
the
book
rose
from
the
grass
and
walked
towards
the
brow
of
the
shore
they
rose
likewise
and
followed
me
i
talked
of
slight
things
the
tone
was
all
that
communicated
between
us
but
little
of
any
sort
was
said
the
sea
lay
still
before
us
knowing
nothing
of
the
sorrow
it
had
caused
we
wandered
a
little
way
along
the
cliff
the
was
at
seven
o
clock
i
have
an
invalid
to
visit
out
in
this
direction
i
said
would
you
mind
walking
with
me
i
shall
not
stay
more
than
five
minutes
and
we
shall
get
back
just
in
time
for
they
assented
kindly
i
walked
first
with
one
then
with
another
heard
a
little
of
the
story
of
each
was
able
to
say
a
few
words
of
sympathy
and
point
as
it
were
a
few
times
towards
the
hills
whence
cometh
our
aid
i
may
just
mention
here
that
since
our
return
to
marshmallows
i
have
had
two
of
them
the
young
woman
and
the
scotchman
to
visit
us
there
the
bell
began
to
toll
and
we
went
to
church
my
companions
placed
themselves
near
the
dead
i
went
into
the
vestry
till
the
appointed
hour
i
thought
as
i
put
on
my
surplice
how
in
all
religions
but
the
christian
the
dead
body
was
a
pollution
to
the
temple
here
the
church
received
it
as
a
holy
thing
for
a
last
embrace
ere
it
went
to
the
earth
as
the
dead
were
already
in
the
church
the
usual
form
could
not
be
carried
out
i
therefore
stood
by
the
and
there
began
to
read
i
am
the
resurrection
and
the
life
saith
the
lord
he
that
believeth
in
me
though
he
were
dead
yet
shall
he
live
and
whosoever
liveth
and
believeth
in
me
shall
never
i
advanced
as
i
read
till
i
came
outside
the
rails
and
stood
before
the
dead
there
i
read
the
psalm
lord
thou
hast
been
our
refuge
and
the
glorious
lesson
now
is
christ
risen
from
the
dead
and
become
the
of
them
that
then
the
men
of
the
neighbourhood
came
forward
and
in
long
solemn
procession
bore
the
bodies
out
of
the
church
each
to
its
grave
at
the
i
stood
and
read
man
that
is
born
of
a
woman
then
went
from
one
to
another
of
the
graves
and
read
over
each
as
the
earth
fell
on
the
forasmuch
as
it
hath
pleased
almighty
god
of
his
great
then
again
i
went
back
to
the
and
read
i
heard
a
voice
from
heaven
and
so
to
the
end
of
the
service
leaving
the
men
to
fill
up
the
graves
i
hastened
to
lay
aside
my
canonicals
that
i
might
join
my
guests
but
my
wife
and
daughter
had
already
prevailed
on
them
to
leave
the
churchyard
a
word
now
concerning
my
own
family
turner
insisted
on
connie
s
remaining
in
bed
for
two
or
three
days
she
looked
worse
in
face
pale
and
worn
but
it
was
clear
from
the
way
she
moved
in
bed
that
the
fresh
power
called
forth
by
the
shock
had
not
vanished
with
the
moment
wynnie
was
quieter
almost
than
ever
but
there
was
a
constant
light
if
i
may
use
the
paradox
in
her
eyes
percivale
was
at
the
house
every
day
always
ready
to
make
himself
useful
my
wife
bore
up
wonderfully
as
yet
the
much
greater
catastrophe
had
come
far
short
of
the
impression
made
by
the
less
when
quieter
hours
should
come
however
i
could
not
help
fearing
that
the
place
would
be
dreadfully
painful
to
all
but
the
younger
ones
who
of
course
had
the
usual
of
forgetting
the
servants
even
walter
looked
thin
and
anxious
that
saturday
night
i
found
myself
as
i
had
once
or
twice
found
myself
before
entirely
unprepared
to
preach
i
did
not
feel
anxious
because
i
did
not
feel
that
i
was
to
blame
i
had
been
so
much
occupied
i
had
again
and
again
turned
my
thoughts
thitherward
but
nothing
recommended
itself
to
me
so
that
i
could
say
i
must
take
that
nothing
said
plainly
this
is
what
you
have
to
speak
as
often
as
i
had
sought
to
find
fitting
matter
for
my
sermon
my
mind
had
turned
to
death
and
the
grave
but
i
shrunk
from
every
suggestion
or
rather
nothing
had
come
to
me
that
interested
myself
enough
to
justify
me
in
giving
it
to
my
people
and
i
always
took
it
as
my
sole
justification
in
speaking
of
anything
to
the
flock
of
christ
that
i
cared
heartily
in
my
own
soul
for
that
thing
without
this
consciousness
i
was
dumb
and
i
do
think
highly
as
i
value
prophecy
that
a
clergyman
ought
to
be
at
liberty
upon
occasion
to
say
my
friends
i
can
not
preach
what
a
riddance
it
would
be
for
the
church
i
do
not
say
if
every
priest
were
to
speak
sense
but
only
if
every
priest
were
to
abstain
from
speaking
of
that
in
which
at
the
moment
he
feels
little
or
no
interest
i
went
to
bed
which
is
often
the
very
best
thing
a
man
can
do
for
sleep
will
bring
him
from
god
that
which
no
effort
of
his
own
will
can
compass
i
have
read
somewhere
i
will
verify
it
by
present
search
that
luther
s
translation
of
the
verse
in
the
psalm
so
he
giveth
to
his
beloved
sleep
is
he
giveth
his
beloved
sleeping
or
while
asleep
yes
so
it
is
literally
in
english
it
is
in
vain
that
ye
rise
early
and
then
sit
long
and
eat
your
bread
with
care
for
to
his
friends
he
gives
it
this
was
my
experience
in
the
present
instance
for
the
thought
of
which
i
was
first
conscious
when
i
awoke
was
why
should
i
talk
about
death
every
man
s
heart
is
now
full
of
death
we
have
enough
of
that
even
the
sum
that
god
has
sent
us
on
the
wings
of
the
tempest
what
i
have
to
do
as
the
minister
of
the
new
covenant
is
to
speak
of
it
flashed
in
on
my
mind
death
is
over
and
gone
the
resurrection
comes
next
i
will
speak
of
the
raising
of
the
same
moment
i
knew
that
i
was
ready
to
speak
shall
i
or
shall
i
not
give
my
reader
the
substance
of
what
i
said
i
wish
i
knew
how
many
of
them
would
like
it
and
how
many
would
not
i
do
not
want
to
bore
them
with
sermons
especially
seeing
i
have
always
said
that
no
sermons
ought
to
be
printed
for
in
print
they
are
but
what
the
old
alchymists
would
have
called
a
or
death
s
head
namely
a
lifeless
lump
of
residuum
at
the
bottom
of
the
crucible
for
they
have
no
longer
the
living
human
utterance
which
gives
all
the
power
on
the
minds
of
the
hearers
but
i
have
not
either
in
this
or
in
my
preceding
narrative
attempted
to
give
a
sermon
as
i
preached
it
i
have
only
sought
to
present
the
substance
of
it
in
a
form
fitter
for
being
read
somewhat
cleared
of
the
unavoidable
let
me
say
necessary
yes
i
will
say
repetitions
and
enforcements
by
which
the
various
considerations
are
pressed
upon
the
minds
of
the
hearers
these
are
entirely
wearisome
in
print
useless
too
for
the
reader
may
ponder
over
every
phrase
till
he
finds
out
the
purport
of
it
if
indeed
there
be
such
readers
nowadays
i
rose
went
down
to
the
bath
in
the
rocks
had
a
joyous
physical
ablution
and
a
swim
up
and
down
the
narrow
cleft
from
which
i
emerged
as
if
myself
newly
born
or
raised
anew
and
then
wandered
about
on
the
downs
full
of
hope
and
thankfulness
seeking
all
i
could
to
plant
deep
in
my
mind
the
truths
of
resurrection
that
they
might
be
not
only
ready
to
blossom
in
the
warmth
of
the
to
come
but
able
to
send
out
some
leaves
and
promissory
buds
even
in
the
wintry
time
of
the
soul
when
the
fogs
of
pain
steam
up
from
the
frozen
clay
soil
of
the
body
and
make
the
totter
dizzily
upon
his
throne
to
comfort
the
eyes
of
the
bewildered
king
reminding
him
that
the
king
of
kings
hath
conquered
death
and
the
grave
there
is
no
perfect
faith
that
can
not
laugh
at
winters
and
graveyards
and
all
the
whole
array
of
defiant
appearances
the
fresh
breeze
of
the
morning
visited
me
o
god
i
said
in
my
heart
would
that
when
the
dark
day
comes
in
which
i
can
feel
nothing
i
may
be
able
to
front
it
with
the
memory
of
this
day
s
strength
and
so
help
myself
to
trust
in
the
father
i
would
call
to
mind
the
days
of
old
with
david
the
when
i
returned
to
the
house
i
found
that
one
of
the
sailors
who
had
been
cast
ashore
with
his
leg
broken
wished
to
see
me
i
obeyed
and
found
him
very
pale
and
worn
i
think
i
am
going
sir
he
said
and
i
wanted
to
see
you
before
i
trust
in
christ
and
do
not
be
afraid
i
returned
i
prayed
to
him
to
save
me
when
i
was
hanging
to
the
rigging
and
if
i
wasn
t
afraid
then
i
m
not
going
to
be
afraid
now
dying
quietly
in
my
bed
but
just
look
here
he
took
from
under
his
pillow
something
wrapped
up
in
paper
unfolded
the
envelope
and
showed
a
lump
of
something
i
could
not
at
first
tell
what
he
put
it
in
my
hand
and
then
i
saw
that
it
was
part
of
a
bible
with
nearly
the
upper
half
of
it
worn
or
cut
away
and
the
rest
partly
in
a
state
of
pulp
that
s
the
bible
my
mother
gave
me
when
i
left
home
first
he
said
i
don
t
know
how
i
came
to
put
it
in
my
pocket
but
i
think
the
rope
that
cut
through
that
when
i
was
lashed
to
the
shrouds
would
a
most
have
cut
through
my
ribs
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
very
likely
i
returned
the
body
of
the
bible
has
saved
your
bodily
life
may
the
spirit
of
it
save
your
spiritual
i
think
i
know
what
you
mean
sir
he
panted
out
my
mother
was
a
good
woman
and
i
know
she
prayed
to
god
for
would
you
like
us
to
pray
for
you
in
church
if
you
please
sir
me
and
bob
fox
he
s
nearly
as
bad
as
i
we
won
t
forget
you
i
said
i
will
come
in
after
church
and
see
how
you
i
knelt
and
offered
the
prayers
for
the
sick
and
then
took
my
leave
i
did
not
think
the
poor
fellow
was
going
to
die
i
may
as
well
mention
here
that
he
has
been
in
my
service
ever
since
we
took
him
with
us
to
marshmallows
where
he
works
in
the
garden
and
stables
and
is
very
useful
we
have
to
look
after
him
though
for
his
health
continues
delicate
chapter
x
the
sermon
when
i
stood
up
to
preach
i
gave
them
no
text
but
with
the
eleventh
chapter
of
the
gospel
of
john
open
before
me
to
keep
me
correct
i
proceeded
to
tell
the
story
in
the
words
god
gave
me
for
who
can
dare
to
say
that
he
makes
his
own
commonest
speech
when
jesus
christ
the
son
of
god
and
therefore
our
elder
brother
was
going
about
on
the
earth
eating
and
drinking
with
his
brothers
and
sisters
there
was
one
family
he
loved
especially
a
family
of
two
sisters
and
a
brother
for
although
he
loves
everybody
as
much
as
they
can
be
loved
there
are
some
who
can
be
loved
more
than
others
only
god
is
always
trying
to
make
us
such
that
we
can
be
loved
more
and
more
there
are
several
stories
o
such
lovely
stories
about
that
family
and
jesus
and
we
have
to
do
with
one
of
them
now
they
lived
near
the
capital
of
the
country
jerusalem
in
a
village
they
called
bethany
and
it
must
have
been
a
great
relief
to
our
lord
when
he
was
worn
out
with
the
obstinacy
and
pride
of
the
great
men
of
the
city
to
go
out
to
the
quiet
little
town
and
into
the
refuge
of
lazarus
s
house
where
everyone
was
more
glad
at
the
sound
of
his
feet
than
at
any
news
that
could
come
to
them
they
had
at
this
time
behaved
so
ill
to
him
in
jerusalem
taking
up
stones
to
stone
him
even
though
they
dared
not
quite
do
it
mad
with
anger
as
they
were
and
all
because
he
told
them
the
truth
that
he
had
gone
away
to
the
other
side
of
the
great
river
that
divided
the
country
and
taught
the
people
in
that
quiet
place
while
he
was
there
his
friend
lazarus
was
taken
ill
and
the
two
sisters
martha
and
mary
sent
a
messenger
to
him
to
say
to
him
lord
your
friend
is
very
only
they
said
it
more
beautifully
than
that
lord
behold
he
whom
thou
lovest
is
you
know
when
anyone
is
ill
we
always
want
the
person
whom
he
loves
most
to
come
to
him
this
is
very
wonderful
in
the
worst
things
that
can
come
to
us
the
first
thought
is
of
love
people
like
the
scribes
and
pharisees
might
say
what
good
can
that
do
him
and
we
may
not
in
the
least
suppose
that
the
person
we
want
knows
any
secret
that
can
cure
his
pain
yet
love
is
the
first
thing
we
think
of
and
here
we
are
more
right
than
we
know
for
at
the
long
last
love
will
cure
everything
which
truth
indeed
this
story
will
set
forth
to
us
no
doubt
the
heart
of
lazarus
ill
as
he
was
longed
after
his
friend
and
very
likely
even
the
sight
of
jesus
might
have
given
him
such
strength
that
the
life
in
him
could
have
driven
out
the
death
which
had
already
got
one
foot
across
the
threshold
but
the
sisters
expected
more
than
this
they
believed
that
jesus
whom
they
knew
to
have
driven
disease
and
death
out
of
so
many
hearts
had
only
to
come
and
touch
him
nay
only
to
speak
a
word
to
look
at
him
and
their
brother
was
saved
do
you
think
they
presumed
in
thus
expecting
the
fact
was
they
did
not
believe
enough
they
had
not
yet
learned
to
believe
that
he
could
cure
him
all
the
same
whether
he
came
to
them
or
not
because
he
was
always
with
them
we
can
not
understand
this
but
our
understanding
is
never
a
measure
of
what
is
true
whether
jesus
knew
exactly
all
that
was
going
to
take
place
i
can
not
tell
some
people
may
feel
certain
upon
points
that
i
dare
not
feel
certain
upon
one
thing
i
am
sure
of
that
he
did
not
always
know
everything
beforehand
for
he
said
so
himself
it
is
infinitely
more
valuable
to
us
because
more
beautiful
and
godlike
in
him
that
he
should
trust
his
father
than
that
he
should
foresee
everything
at
all
events
he
knew
that
his
father
did
not
want
him
to
go
to
his
friends
yet
so
he
sent
them
a
message
to
the
effect
that
there
was
a
particular
reason
for
this
sickness
that
the
end
of
it
was
not
the
death
of
lazarus
but
the
glory
of
god
this
i
think
he
told
them
by
the
same
messenger
they
sent
to
him
and
then
instead
of
going
to
them
he
remained
where
he
was
but
o
my
friends
what
shall
i
say
about
this
wonderful
message
think
of
being
sick
for
the
glory
of
god
of
being
shipwrecked
for
the
glory
of
god
of
being
drowned
for
the
glory
of
god
how
can
the
sickness
the
fear
the
of
his
creatures
be
for
the
glory
of
god
what
kind
of
a
god
can
that
be
why
just
a
god
so
perfectly
absolutely
good
that
the
things
that
look
least
like
it
are
only
the
means
of
clearing
our
eyes
to
let
us
see
how
good
he
is
for
he
is
so
good
that
he
is
not
satisfied
with
good
he
loves
his
children
so
that
except
he
can
make
them
good
like
himself
make
them
blessed
by
seeing
how
good
he
is
and
desiring
the
same
goodness
in
themselves
he
is
not
satisfied
he
is
not
like
a
fine
proud
benefactor
who
is
content
with
doing
that
which
will
satisfy
his
sense
of
his
own
glory
but
like
a
mother
who
puts
her
arm
round
her
child
and
whose
heart
is
sore
till
she
can
make
her
child
see
the
love
which
is
her
glory
the
glorification
of
the
son
of
god
is
the
glorification
of
the
human
race
for
the
glory
of
god
is
the
glory
of
man
and
that
glory
is
love
welcome
sickness
welcome
sorrow
welcome
death
revealing
that
glory
the
next
two
verses
sound
very
strangely
together
and
yet
they
almost
seem
typical
of
all
the
perplexities
of
god
s
dealings
the
old
painters
and
poets
represented
faith
as
a
beautiful
woman
holding
in
her
hand
a
cup
of
wine
and
water
with
a
serpent
coiled
up
within
highhearted
faith
she
scruples
not
to
drink
of
the
wine
and
water
she
is
not
repelled
by
the
upcoiled
serpent
the
serpent
she
takes
but
for
the
type
of
the
eternal
wisdom
that
looks
repellent
because
it
is
not
understood
the
wine
is
good
the
water
is
good
and
if
the
hand
of
the
supreme
fate
put
that
cup
in
her
hand
the
serpent
itself
must
be
good
too
harmless
at
least
to
hurt
the
truth
of
the
water
and
the
wine
but
let
us
read
the
verses
now
jesus
loved
martha
and
her
sister
and
lazarus
when
he
had
heard
therefore
that
he
was
sick
he
abode
two
days
still
in
the
same
place
where
he
strange
his
friend
was
sick
he
abode
two
days
where
he
was
but
remember
what
we
have
already
heard
the
glory
of
god
was
infinitely
more
for
the
final
cure
of
a
dying
lazarus
who
give
him
all
the
life
he
could
have
would
yet
without
that
glory
be
in
death
than
the
mere
presence
of
the
son
of
god
i
say
presence
for
compared
with
the
glory
of
god
the
very
presence
of
his
son
so
dissociated
is
nothing
he
abode
where
he
was
that
the
glory
of
god
the
final
cure
of
humanity
the
love
that
triumphs
over
death
might
shine
out
and
redeem
the
hearts
of
men
so
that
death
could
not
touch
them
after
the
two
days
the
hour
had
arrived
he
said
to
his
disciples
let
us
go
back
to
they
expostulated
because
of
the
danger
saying
master
the
jews
of
late
sought
to
stone
thee
and
goest
thou
thither
again
the
answer
which
he
gave
them
i
am
not
sure
whether
i
can
thoroughly
understand
but
i
think
in
fact
i
know
it
must
bear
on
the
same
region
of
life
the
will
of
god
i
think
what
he
means
by
walking
in
the
day
is
simply
doing
the
will
of
god
that
was
the
sole
the
light
in
which
jesus
ever
walked
i
think
he
means
that
now
he
saw
plainly
what
the
father
wanted
him
to
do
if
he
did
not
see
that
the
father
wanted
him
to
go
back
to
judæa
and
yet
went
that
would
be
to
go
stumblingly
to
walk
in
the
darkness
there
are
twelve
hours
in
the
day
one
time
to
act
a
time
of
light
and
the
clear
call
of
duty
there
is
a
night
when
a
man
not
seeing
where
or
hearing
how
must
be
content
to
rest
something
not
inharmonious
with
this
i
think
he
must
have
intended
but
i
do
not
see
the
whole
thought
clearly
enough
to
be
sure
that
i
am
right
i
do
think
further
that
it
points
at
a
clearer
condition
of
human
vision
and
conviction
than
i
am
good
enough
to
understand
though
i
hope
one
day
to
rise
into
this
upper
stratum
of
light
whether
his
scholars
had
heard
anything
of
lazarus
yet
i
do
not
know
it
looks
a
little
as
if
jesus
had
not
told
them
the
message
he
had
had
from
the
sisters
but
he
told
them
now
that
he
was
asleep
and
that
he
was
going
to
wake
him
you
would
think
they
might
have
understood
this
the
idea
of
going
so
many
miles
to
wake
a
man
might
have
surely
suggested
death
but
the
disciples
were
sorely
perplexed
with
many
of
his
words
sometimes
they
looked
far
away
for
the
meaning
when
the
meaning
lay
in
their
very
hearts
sometimes
they
looked
into
their
hands
for
it
when
it
was
lost
in
the
grandeur
of
the
ages
but
he
meant
them
to
see
into
all
that
he
said
by
and
by
although
they
could
not
see
into
it
now
when
they
understood
him
better
then
they
would
understand
what
he
said
better
and
to
understand
him
better
they
must
be
more
like
him
and
to
make
them
more
like
him
he
must
go
away
and
give
them
his
spirit
awful
mystery
which
no
man
but
himself
can
understand
now
he
had
to
tell
them
plainly
that
lazarus
was
dead
they
had
not
thought
of
death
as
a
sleep
i
suppose
this
was
altogether
a
new
and
christian
idea
do
not
suppose
that
it
applied
more
to
lazarus
than
to
other
dead
people
he
was
none
the
less
dead
that
jesus
meant
to
take
a
weary
two
days
journey
to
his
sepulchre
and
wake
him
if
death
is
not
a
sleep
jesus
did
not
speak
the
truth
when
he
said
lazarus
slept
you
may
say
it
was
a
figure
but
a
figure
that
is
not
like
the
thing
it
figures
is
simply
a
lie
they
set
out
to
go
back
to
judæa
here
we
have
a
glimpse
of
the
faith
of
thomas
the
doubter
for
a
doubter
is
not
without
faith
the
very
fact
that
he
doubts
shows
that
he
has
some
faith
when
i
find
anyone
hard
upon
doubters
i
always
doubt
the
of
his
faith
it
is
of
little
use
to
have
a
great
cable
if
the
hemp
is
so
poor
that
it
breaks
like
the
painter
of
a
boat
i
have
known
people
whose
power
of
believing
chiefly
consisted
in
their
incapacity
for
seeing
difficulties
of
what
fine
sort
a
faith
must
be
that
is
founded
in
stupidity
or
far
worse
in
indifference
to
the
truth
and
the
mere
desire
to
get
out
of
hell
that
is
not
a
grand
belief
in
the
son
of
god
the
radiation
of
the
father
thomas
s
want
of
faith
was
shown
in
the
grumbling
way
in
which
he
said
let
us
also
go
that
we
may
die
with
his
master
had
said
that
he
was
going
to
wake
him
thomas
said
that
we
may
die
with
you
may
say
he
did
not
understand
true
it
may
be
but
his
unbelief
was
the
cause
of
his
not
understanding
him
i
suppose
thomas
meant
this
as
a
reproach
to
jesus
for
putting
them
all
in
danger
by
going
back
to
judæa
if
not
it
was
only
a
poor
piece
of
sentimentality
so
much
for
thomas
s
unbelief
but
he
had
good
and
true
faith
notwithstanding
for
went
with
his
by
the
time
they
reached
the
neighbourhood
of
bethany
lazarus
had
been
dead
four
days
someone
ran
to
the
house
and
told
the
sisters
that
jesus
was
coming
martha
as
soon
as
she
heard
it
rose
and
went
to
meet
him
it
might
be
interesting
at
another
time
to
compare
the
difference
of
the
behaviour
of
the
two
sisters
upon
this
occasion
with
the
difference
of
their
behaviour
upon
another
occasion
likewise
recorded
but
with
the
man
dead
in
his
sepulchre
and
the
hope
dead
in
these
two
hearts
we
have
no
inclination
to
enter
upon
fine
distinctions
of
character
death
and
grief
bring
out
the
great
family
likenesses
in
the
living
as
well
as
in
the
dead
when
martha
came
to
jesus
she
showed
her
true
though
imperfect
faith
by
almost
attributing
her
brother
s
death
to
jesus
absence
but
even
in
the
moment
looking
in
the
face
of
the
master
a
fresh
hope
a
new
budding
of
faith
began
in
her
soul
she
thought
what
if
after
all
he
were
to
bring
him
to
life
again
o
trusting
heart
how
thou
leavest
the
intellect
behind
thee
while
the
conceited
intellect
is
reasoning
upon
the
impossibility
of
the
thing
the
expectant
faith
beholds
it
accomplished
jesus
responding
instantly
to
her
faith
granting
her
prayer
says
thy
brother
shall
rise
again
not
meaning
the
general
truth
recognised
or
at
least
assented
to
by
all
but
the
sadducees
concerning
the
final
resurrection
of
the
dead
but
meaning
be
it
unto
thee
as
thou
wilt
i
will
raise
him
for
there
is
no
steering
for
a
fine
effect
in
the
words
of
jesus
but
these
words
are
too
good
for
martha
to
take
them
as
he
meant
them
her
faith
is
not
quite
equal
to
the
belief
that
he
actually
will
do
it
the
thing
she
could
hope
for
afar
off
she
could
hardly
believe
when
it
came
to
her
very
door
o
yes
she
said
her
mood
falling
again
to
the
level
of
the
commonplace
of
course
at
the
last
then
the
lord
turns
away
her
thoughts
from
the
dogmas
of
her
faith
to
himself
the
life
saying
i
am
the
resurrection
and
the
life
he
that
believeth
in
me
though
he
were
dead
yet
shall
he
live
and
whosoever
liveth
and
believeth
in
me
shall
never
die
believest
thou
this
martha
without
understanding
what
he
said
more
than
in
a
very
poor
part
answered
in
words
which
preserved
her
honesty
entire
and
yet
included
all
he
asked
and
a
thousandfold
more
than
she
could
yet
believe
yea
lord
i
believe
that
thou
art
the
christ
the
son
of
god
which
should
come
into
the
i
dare
not
pretend
to
have
more
than
a
grand
glimmering
of
the
truth
of
jesus
words
shall
never
die
but
i
am
pretty
sure
that
when
martha
came
to
die
she
found
that
there
was
indeed
no
such
thing
as
she
had
meant
when
she
used
the
ghastly
word
and
said
with
her
first
new
breath
verily
lord
i
am
not
but
look
how
this
declaration
of
her
confidence
in
the
christ
operated
upon
herself
she
instantly
thought
of
her
sister
the
hope
that
the
lord
would
do
something
swelled
within
her
and
leaving
jesus
she
went
to
find
mary
whoever
has
had
a
true
word
with
the
elder
brother
straightway
will
look
around
him
to
find
his
brother
his
sister
the
family
feeling
blossoms
he
wants
his
friend
to
share
the
glory
withal
martha
wants
mary
to
go
to
jesus
too
mary
heard
her
forgot
her
visitors
rose
and
went
they
thought
she
went
to
the
grave
she
went
to
meet
its
conqueror
but
when
she
came
to
him
the
woman
who
had
chosen
the
good
part
praised
of
jesus
had
but
the
same
words
to
embody
her
hope
and
her
grief
that
her
careful
and
troubled
sister
had
uttered
a
few
minutes
before
how
often
during
those
four
days
had
not
the
words
passed
between
them
ah
if
he
had
been
here
our
brother
had
not
died
she
said
so
to
himself
now
and
wept
and
her
friends
who
had
followed
her
wept
likewise
a
moment
more
and
the
master
groaned
yet
a
moment
and
he
too
wept
sorrow
is
catching
but
this
was
not
the
mere
infection
of
sorrow
it
went
deeper
than
mere
sympathy
for
he
groaned
in
his
spirit
and
was
troubled
what
made
him
weep
it
was
when
he
saw
them
weeping
that
he
wept
but
why
should
he
weep
when
he
knew
how
soon
their
weeping
would
be
turned
into
rejoicing
it
was
not
for
their
weeping
so
soon
to
be
over
that
he
wept
but
for
the
human
heart
everywhere
swollen
with
tears
yea
with
griefs
that
can
find
no
such
relief
as
tears
for
these
and
for
all
his
brothers
and
sisters
tormented
with
pain
for
lack
of
faith
in
his
father
in
heaven
jesus
wept
he
saw
the
blessed
of
lazarus
on
the
one
side
and
on
the
other
the
streaming
eyes
from
whose
sight
he
had
vanished
the
veil
between
was
so
thin
yet
the
sight
of
those
eyes
could
not
pierce
it
their
hearts
must
go
on
weeping
without
cause
for
his
father
was
so
good
i
think
it
was
the
helplessness
he
felt
in
the
impossibility
of
at
once
sweeping
away
the
phantasm
death
from
their
imagination
that
drew
the
tears
from
the
eyes
of
jesus
certainly
it
was
not
for
lazarus
it
could
hardly
be
for
these
his
friends
save
as
they
represented
the
humanity
which
he
would
help
but
could
not
help
even
as
he
was
about
to
help
them
the
jews
saw
herein
proof
that
he
loved
lazarus
but
they
little
thought
it
was
for
them
and
their
people
and
for
the
gentiles
whom
they
despised
that
his
tears
were
now
flowing
that
the
love
which
pressed
the
fountains
of
his
weeping
was
love
for
every
human
heart
from
adam
on
through
the
ages
some
of
them
went
a
little
farther
nearly
as
far
as
the
sisters
saying
could
he
not
have
kept
the
man
from
dying
but
it
was
such
a
poor
thing
after
all
that
they
thought
he
might
have
done
they
regarded
merely
this
unexpected
illness
this
early
death
for
i
daresay
lazarus
was
not
much
older
than
jesus
they
did
not
think
that
after
all
lazarus
must
die
some
time
that
the
beloved
could
be
saved
at
best
only
for
a
little
while
jesus
seems
to
have
heard
the
remark
for
he
again
groaned
in
himself
meantime
they
were
drawing
near
the
place
where
he
was
buried
it
was
a
hollow
in
the
face
of
a
rock
with
a
stone
laid
against
it
i
suppose
the
bodies
were
laid
on
something
like
shelves
inside
the
rock
as
they
are
in
many
sepulchres
they
were
not
put
into
coffins
but
wound
round
and
round
with
linen
when
they
came
before
the
door
of
death
jesus
said
to
them
take
away
the
the
nature
of
martha
s
reply
the
realism
of
it
as
they
would
say
would
seem
to
indicate
that
her
dawning
faith
had
sunk
again
below
the
horizon
that
in
the
presence
of
the
insignia
of
death
her
faith
yielded
even
as
the
faith
of
peter
failed
him
when
he
saw
around
him
the
grandeur
of
the
and
his
master
bound
and
helpless
jesus
answered
o
what
an
answer
to
meet
the
corruption
and
the
stink
which
filled
her
poor
human
fancy
the
glory
of
god
came
from
his
lips
human
fear
horror
speaking
from
the
lips
of
a
woman
in
the
very
jaws
of
the
devouring
death
and
the
said
i
not
unto
thee
from
the
mouth
of
him
who
was
so
soon
to
pass
worn
and
bloodless
through
such
a
door
he
stinketh
said
martha
the
glory
of
god
said
jesus
said
i
not
unto
thee
that
if
thou
wouldest
believe
thou
shouldest
see
the
glory
of
god
before
the
open
throat
of
the
sepulchre
jesus
began
to
speak
to
his
father
aloud
he
had
prayed
to
him
in
his
heart
before
most
likely
while
he
groaned
in
his
spirit
now
he
thanked
him
that
he
had
comforted
him
and
given
him
lazarus
as
a
from
the
dead
but
he
will
be
true
to
the
listening
people
as
well
as
to
his
father
therefore
he
tells
why
he
said
the
word
of
thanks
aloud
a
thing
not
usual
with
him
for
his
father
was
always
hearing
him
having
spoken
it
for
the
people
he
would
say
that
it
was
for
the
people
the
end
of
it
all
was
that
they
might
believe
that
god
had
sent
him
a
far
grander
gift
than
having
the
dearest
brought
back
from
the
grave
for
he
is
the
life
of
men
lazarus
come
forth
and
lazarus
came
forth
creeping
helplessly
with
steps
of
his
limbs
ha
ha
brother
sister
cries
the
human
heart
the
lord
of
life
hath
taken
the
prey
from
the
spoiler
he
hath
emptied
the
grave
here
comes
the
dead
man
welcome
as
never
was
child
from
the
womb
and
in
him
all
the
human
race
from
the
grave
loose
him
and
let
him
go
and
the
work
is
done
the
sorrow
is
over
and
the
joy
is
come
home
home
martha
mary
with
your
lazarus
he
too
will
go
with
you
the
lord
of
the
living
home
and
get
the
feast
ready
martha
prepare
the
food
for
him
who
comes
hungry
from
the
grave
for
him
who
has
called
him
thence
home
mary
to
help
martha
what
a
household
will
yours
be
what
wondrous
speech
will
pass
between
the
dead
come
to
life
and
the
living
come
to
die
but
what
pang
is
this
that
makes
lazarus
draw
hurried
breath
and
turns
martha
s
cheek
so
pale
ah
at
the
little
window
of
the
heart
the
pale
eyes
of
the
defeated
horror
look
in
what
is
he
there
still
ah
yes
he
will
come
for
martha
come
for
mary
come
yet
again
for
lazarus
yea
come
for
the
lord
of
life
himself
and
carry
all
away
but
look
at
the
lord
he
knows
all
about
it
and
he
smiles
does
martha
think
of
the
words
he
spoke
he
that
liveth
and
believeth
in
me
shall
never
die
perhaps
she
does
and
like
the
moon
before
the
sun
her
face
returns
the
smile
of
her
lord
this
my
friends
is
a
fancy
in
form
but
it
embodies
a
dear
truth
what
is
it
to
you
and
me
that
he
raised
lazarus
we
are
not
called
upon
to
believe
that
he
will
raise
from
the
tomb
that
joy
of
our
hearts
which
lies
buried
there
beyond
our
sight
stop
are
we
not
we
are
called
upon
to
believe
this
else
the
whole
story
were
for
us
a
poor
mockery
what
is
it
to
us
that
the
lord
raised
lazarus
is
it
nothing
to
know
that
our
brother
is
lord
over
the
grave
will
the
harvest
be
behind
the
if
he
tells
us
he
can
not
for
good
reasons
raise
up
our
vanished
love
or
or
for
all
the
years
of
our
life
to
come
shall
we
not
mingle
the
smile
of
faithful
thanks
with
the
sorrow
of
present
loss
and
walk
diligently
waiting
that
he
called
forth
lazarus
showed
that
he
was
in
his
keeping
that
he
is
lord
of
the
living
and
that
all
live
to
him
that
he
has
a
hold
of
them
and
can
draw
them
forth
when
he
will
if
this
is
not
true
then
the
raising
of
lazarus
is
false
i
do
not
mean
merely
false
in
fact
but
false
in
meaning
if
we
believe
in
him
then
in
his
name
both
for
ourselves
and
for
our
friends
we
must
deny
death
and
believe
in
life
lord
christ
fill
our
hearts
with
thy
life
chapter
xi
changed
plans
in
a
day
or
two
connie
was
permitted
to
rise
and
take
to
her
couch
once
more
it
seemed
strange
that
she
should
look
so
much
worse
and
yet
be
so
much
stronger
the
growth
of
her
power
of
motion
was
wonderful
as
they
carried
her
she
begged
to
be
allowed
to
put
her
feet
to
the
ground
turner
yielded
though
without
quite
ceasing
to
support
her
he
was
satisfied
however
that
she
could
have
stood
upright
for
a
moment
at
least
he
would
not
of
course
risk
it
and
made
haste
to
lay
her
down
the
time
of
his
departure
was
coming
near
and
he
seemed
more
anxious
the
nearer
it
came
for
connie
continued
and
pale
and
her
smile
though
ever
ready
to
greet
me
when
i
entered
had
lost
much
of
its
light
i
noticed
too
that
she
had
the
curtain
of
her
window
constantly
so
arranged
as
to
shut
out
the
sea
i
said
something
to
her
about
it
once
her
reply
was
papa
i
can
t
bear
it
i
know
it
is
very
silly
but
i
think
i
can
make
you
understand
how
it
is
i
was
so
fond
of
the
sea
when
i
came
down
it
seemed
to
lie
close
to
my
window
with
a
friendly
smile
ready
for
me
every
morning
when
i
looked
out
i
daresay
it
is
all
from
want
of
faith
but
i
can
t
help
it
it
looks
so
far
away
now
like
a
friend
that
had
failed
me
that
i
would
rather
not
see
i
saw
that
the
struggling
life
within
her
was
grievously
oppressed
that
the
things
which
surrounded
her
were
no
longer
helpful
her
life
had
been
driven
as
to
its
innermost
cave
and
now
when
it
had
been
enticed
to
venture
forth
and
look
abroad
a
sudden
pall
had
descended
upon
nature
i
could
not
help
thinking
that
the
good
of
our
visit
to
kilkhaven
had
come
and
that
evil
from
which
i
hoped
we
might
yet
escape
was
following
i
left
her
and
sought
turner
it
strikes
me
turner
i
said
that
the
sooner
we
get
out
of
this
the
better
for
i
am
quite
of
your
opinion
i
think
the
very
prospect
of
leaving
the
place
would
do
something
to
restore
her
if
she
is
so
uncomfortable
now
think
what
it
will
be
in
the
many
winter
nights
at
do
you
think
it
would
be
safe
to
move
her
far
safer
than
to
let
her
remain
at
the
worst
she
is
now
far
better
than
when
she
came
try
her
hint
at
the
possibility
of
going
home
and
see
how
she
will
take
well
i
sha
n
t
like
to
be
left
alone
but
if
she
goes
they
must
all
go
except
perhaps
i
might
keep
wynnie
but
i
don
t
know
how
her
mother
would
get
on
without
i
don
t
see
why
you
should
stay
behind
weir
would
be
as
glad
to
come
as
you
would
be
to
go
and
it
can
make
no
difference
to
it
seemed
a
very
sensible
suggestion
i
thought
a
moment
certainly
it
was
a
desirable
thing
for
both
my
sister
and
her
husband
they
had
no
such
reasons
as
we
had
for
disliking
the
place
and
it
would
enable
her
to
avoid
the
severity
of
yet
another
winter
i
said
as
much
to
turner
and
went
back
to
connie
s
room
the
light
of
a
lovely
sunset
was
lying
outside
her
window
she
was
sitting
so
that
she
could
not
see
it
i
would
find
out
her
feeling
in
the
matter
without
any
preamble
would
you
like
to
go
back
to
marshmallows
connie
i
asked
her
countenance
flashed
into
light
o
dear
papa
do
let
us
go
she
said
that
would
be
well
i
think
we
can
manage
it
if
you
will
only
get
a
little
stronger
for
the
journey
the
weather
is
not
so
good
to
travel
in
as
when
we
came
no
but
i
am
ever
so
much
better
you
know
than
i
was
the
poor
girl
was
already
stronger
from
the
mere
prospect
of
going
home
again
she
moved
restlessly
on
her
couch
half
mechanically
put
her
hand
to
the
curtain
pulled
it
aside
looked
out
faced
the
sun
and
the
sea
and
did
not
draw
back
my
mind
was
made
up
i
left
her
and
went
to
find
ethelwyn
she
heartily
approved
of
the
proposal
for
connie
s
sake
and
said
that
it
would
be
scarcely
less
agreeable
to
herself
i
could
see
a
certain
troubled
look
above
her
eyes
however
you
are
thinking
of
wynnie
i
said
yes
it
is
hard
to
make
one
sad
for
the
sake
of
the
true
but
it
is
one
of
the
world
s
recognised
no
besides
you
don
t
suppose
percivale
can
stay
here
the
whole
winter
they
must
part
some
of
course
only
they
did
not
expect
it
so
but
here
my
wife
was
mistaken
i
went
to
my
study
to
write
to
weir
i
had
hardly
finished
my
letter
when
walter
came
to
say
that
percivale
wished
to
see
me
i
told
him
to
show
him
in
i
am
just
writing
home
to
say
that
i
want
my
curate
to
change
places
with
me
here
which
i
know
he
will
be
glad
enough
to
do
i
see
connie
had
better
go
you
will
all
go
then
i
presume
returned
percivale
yes
yes
of
then
i
need
not
so
much
regret
that
i
can
stay
no
longer
i
came
to
tell
you
that
i
must
leave
ah
going
to
london
yes
i
don
t
know
how
to
thank
you
for
all
your
kindness
you
have
made
my
summer
something
like
a
summer
very
different
indeed
from
what
it
would
otherwise
have
we
have
had
our
share
of
advantage
and
that
a
large
one
we
are
all
glad
to
have
made
your
acquaintance
he
made
no
answer
we
shall
be
passing
through
london
within
a
week
or
ten
days
in
all
probability
perhaps
you
will
allow
us
the
pleasure
of
looking
at
some
of
your
pictures
then
his
face
flushed
what
did
the
flush
mean
it
was
not
one
of
mere
pleasure
there
was
confusion
and
perplexity
in
it
but
he
answered
at
once
i
will
show
you
them
with
pleasure
i
fear
however
you
will
not
care
for
would
this
fear
account
for
his
embarrassment
i
hardly
thought
it
would
but
i
could
not
for
a
moment
imagine
with
his
fine
form
and
countenance
before
me
that
he
had
any
serious
reason
for
shrinking
from
a
visit
he
began
to
search
for
a
card
o
i
have
your
address
i
shall
be
sure
to
pay
you
a
visit
but
you
will
dine
with
us
of
course
i
said
i
shall
have
much
pleasure
he
answered
and
took
his
leave
i
finished
my
letter
to
weir
and
went
out
for
a
walk
i
remember
particularly
the
thoughts
that
moved
in
me
and
made
that
walk
memorable
indeed
i
think
i
remember
all
outside
events
chiefly
by
virtue
of
the
inward
conditions
with
which
they
were
associated
mere
outside
things
i
am
very
ready
to
forget
moods
of
my
own
mind
do
not
so
readily
pass
away
and
with
the
memory
of
some
of
them
every
outward
circumstance
returns
for
a
man
s
life
is
where
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
within
him
there
are
people
who
if
you
ask
the
story
of
their
lives
have
nothing
to
tell
you
but
the
course
of
the
outward
events
that
have
constituted
as
it
were
the
clothes
of
their
history
but
i
know
at
the
same
time
that
some
of
the
most
important
crises
in
my
own
history
by
which
word
i
mean
my
growth
towards
the
right
conditions
of
existence
have
been
beyond
the
grasp
and
interpretation
of
my
intellect
they
have
passed
as
it
were
without
my
consciousness
being
awake
enough
to
lay
hold
of
their
phenomena
the
wind
had
been
blowing
i
had
heard
the
sound
of
it
but
knew
not
whence
it
came
nor
whither
it
went
only
when
it
was
gone
i
found
myself
more
responsible
more
eager
than
before
i
remember
this
walk
from
the
thoughts
i
had
about
the
great
change
hanging
over
us
all
i
had
now
arrived
at
the
prime
of
middle
life
and
that
change
which
so
many
would
escape
if
they
could
but
which
will
let
no
man
pass
had
begun
to
show
itself
a
real
fact
upon
the
horizon
of
the
future
death
looks
so
far
away
to
the
young
that
while
they
acknowledge
it
unavoidable
the
path
stretches
on
in
such
vanishing
perspective
before
them
that
they
see
no
necessity
for
thinking
about
the
end
of
it
yet
and
far
would
i
be
from
saying
they
ought
to
think
of
it
life
is
the
true
object
of
a
man
s
care
there
is
no
occasion
to
make
himself
think
about
death
but
when
the
vision
of
the
inevitable
draws
nigh
when
it
appears
plainly
on
the
horizon
though
but
as
a
cloud
the
size
of
a
man
s
hand
then
it
is
equally
foolish
to
meet
it
by
refusing
to
meet
it
to
answer
the
questions
that
will
arise
by
declining
to
think
about
them
indeed
it
is
a
question
of
life
then
and
not
of
death
we
want
to
keep
fast
hold
of
our
life
and
in
the
strength
of
that
to
look
the
threatening
death
in
the
face
but
to
my
walk
that
morning
i
wandered
on
the
downs
till
i
came
to
the
place
where
a
solitary
rock
stands
on
the
top
of
a
cliff
looking
seaward
in
the
suggested
shape
of
a
monk
praying
on
the
base
on
which
he
knelt
i
seated
myself
and
looked
out
over
the
atlantic
how
faded
the
ocean
appeared
it
seemed
as
if
all
the
sunny
dyes
of
the
summer
had
been
diluted
and
washed
with
the
fogs
of
the
coming
winter
when
i
thought
of
the
splendour
it
wore
when
first
from
these
downs
i
gazed
on
the
outspread
infinitude
of
space
and
colour
what
i
said
to
myself
at
length
has
she
done
since
then
where
is
her
work
visible
she
has
riven
and
battered
and
destroyed
and
her
destruction
too
has
passed
away
so
worketh
time
and
its
powers
the
exultation
of
my
youth
is
gone
my
head
is
gray
my
wife
is
growing
old
our
children
are
pushing
us
from
our
stools
we
are
yielding
to
the
new
generation
the
glory
for
us
hath
departed
our
life
lies
weary
before
us
like
that
sea
and
the
night
cometh
when
we
can
no
longer
something
like
this
was
passing
vaguely
through
my
mind
i
sat
in
a
mournful
stupor
with
a
that
my
mood
was
false
and
that
i
ought
to
rouse
myself
and
shake
it
off
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
state
of
moral
dreaming
which
closely
resembles
the
intellectual
dreaming
in
sleep
i
went
on
in
this
false
dreamful
mood
pitying
myself
like
a
child
tender
over
his
hurt
and
nursing
his
own
cowardice
till
all
at
once
a
little
pipling
wind
blew
on
my
cheek
the
morning
was
very
still
what
roused
that
little
wind
i
can
not
tell
but
what
that
little
wind
roused
i
will
try
to
tell
with
that
breath
on
my
cheek
something
within
me
began
to
stir
it
grew
and
grew
until
the
memory
of
a
certain
glorious
sunset
of
red
and
green
and
gold
and
blue
which
i
had
beheld
from
these
same
heights
dawned
within
me
i
knew
that
the
glory
of
my
youth
had
not
departed
that
the
very
power
of
recalling
with
delight
that
which
i
had
once
felt
in
seeing
was
proof
enough
of
that
i
knew
that
i
could
believe
in
god
all
the
night
long
even
if
the
night
were
long
and
the
next
moment
i
thought
how
i
had
been
reviling
in
my
fancy
god
s
servant
the
sea
to
how
many
vessels
had
she
not
opened
a
bounteous
highway
through
the
waters
with
labour
and
food
and
help
and
ministration
glad
breezes
and
swelling
sails
healthful
struggle
cleansing
fear
and
sorrow
yea
and
friendly
death
because
she
had
been
commissioned
to
carry
this
one
or
that
one
this
hundred
or
that
thousand
of
his
own
creatures
from
one
world
to
another
was
i
to
revile
the
servant
of
a
grand
and
gracious
master
it
was
blameless
in
connie
to
feel
the
late
trouble
so
deeply
that
she
could
not
be
glad
she
had
not
had
the
experience
of
life
yea
of
god
that
i
had
had
she
must
be
helped
from
without
but
for
me
it
was
shameful
that
i
who
knew
the
heart
of
my
master
to
whom
at
least
he
had
so
often
shown
his
truth
should
ever
be
doleful
and
oppressed
yet
even
me
he
had
now
helped
from
within
the
glory
of
existence
as
the
child
of
the
infinite
had
again
dawned
upon
me
the
first
hour
of
the
evening
of
my
life
had
indeed
arrived
the
shadows
had
begun
to
grow
long
so
long
that
i
had
begun
to
mark
their
length
this
last
little
portion
of
my
history
had
vanished
leaving
its
few
gray
ashes
behind
in
the
crucible
of
my
life
and
the
final
evening
must
come
when
all
my
life
would
lie
behind
me
and
all
the
memory
of
it
return
with
its
mornings
of
gold
and
red
with
its
evenings
of
purple
and
green
with
its
dashes
of
storm
and
its
foggy
glooms
with
its
aspirations
its
passions
its
creeping
envies
in
brown
and
black
and
earthy
yellow
but
from
all
the
accusations
of
my
conscience
i
would
turn
me
to
the
lord
for
he
was
called
jesus
because
he
should
save
his
people
from
their
sins
then
i
thought
what
a
grand
gift
it
would
be
to
give
his
people
the
power
hereafter
to
fight
the
consequences
of
their
sins
anyhow
i
would
trust
the
father
who
loved
me
with
a
perfect
love
to
lead
the
soul
he
had
made
had
compelled
to
be
through
the
gates
of
the
into
the
light
of
life
beyond
i
would
cast
on
him
the
care
humbly
challenge
him
with
the
responsibility
he
had
himself
undertaken
praying
only
for
perfect
confidence
in
him
absolute
submission
to
his
will
i
rose
from
my
seat
beside
the
praying
monk
and
walked
on
the
thought
of
seeing
my
own
people
again
filled
me
with
gladness
i
would
leave
those
i
had
here
learned
to
love
with
regret
but
i
trusted
i
had
taught
them
something
and
they
had
taught
me
much
therefore
there
could
be
no
end
to
our
relation
to
each
other
it
could
not
be
broken
for
it
was
the
which
alone
can
give
security
to
any
tie
i
should
not
therefore
sorrow
as
if
i
were
to
see
their
faces
no
more
i
now
took
my
farewell
of
that
sea
and
those
cliffs
i
should
see
them
often
ere
we
went
but
i
should
not
feel
so
near
them
again
even
this
parting
said
that
i
must
sit
loose
to
the
world
an
old
puritan
phrase
i
suppose
that
i
could
gather
up
only
its
uses
treasure
its
best
things
and
must
let
all
the
rest
go
that
those
things
i
called
mine
earth
sky
and
sea
home
books
the
treasured
gifts
of
friends
had
all
to
leave
me
belong
to
others
and
help
to
educate
them
i
should
not
need
them
i
should
have
my
people
my
souls
my
beloved
faces
tenfold
more
and
could
well
afford
to
part
with
these
why
should
i
mind
this
chain
passing
to
my
eldest
boy
when
it
was
only
his
mother
s
hair
and
i
should
have
his
mother
still
so
my
thoughts
went
on
thinking
themselves
until
at
length
i
yielded
passively
to
their
flow
i
found
wynnie
looking
very
grave
when
i
went
into
the
her
mother
was
there
too
and
percivale
it
seemed
rather
a
moody
party
they
wakened
up
a
little
however
after
i
entered
and
before
dinner
was
over
we
were
all
chatting
together
merrily
how
is
connie
i
asked
ethelwyn
wonderfully
better
already
she
answered
i
think
everybody
seems
better
i
said
the
very
idea
of
home
seems
reviving
to
us
wynnie
darted
a
quick
glance
at
me
caught
my
eyes
which
was
more
than
she
had
intended
and
blushed
sought
refuge
in
a
bewildered
glance
at
percivale
caught
his
eye
in
turn
and
blushed
yet
deeper
he
plunged
instantly
into
conversation
not
without
a
certain
involuntary
sparkle
in
his
eye
did
you
go
to
see
stokes
this
morning
he
asked
no
i
answered
she
does
not
want
much
visiting
now
she
is
going
about
her
work
apparently
in
good
health
her
husband
says
she
is
not
like
the
same
woman
and
i
hope
he
means
that
in
more
senses
than
one
though
i
do
not
choose
to
ask
him
any
questions
about
his
i
did
my
best
to
keep
up
the
conversation
but
every
now
and
then
after
this
it
fell
like
a
wind
that
would
not
blow
i
withdrew
to
my
study
percivale
and
wynnie
went
out
for
a
walk
the
next
morning
he
left
by
the
coach
early
turner
went
with
him
wynnie
did
not
seem
very
much
dejected
i
thought
that
perhaps
the
prospect
of
meeting
him
again
in
london
kept
her
up
chapter
xii
the
studio
i
will
not
linger
over
our
preparations
or
our
the
most
ponderous
of
the
former
were
those
of
the
two
boys
who
as
they
had
wanted
to
bring
down
a
chest
as
big
as
a
full
of
lumber
now
wanted
to
take
home
two
or
three
boxes
filled
with
pebbles
great
oystershells
and
weir
as
i
had
expected
was
quite
pleased
to
make
the
exchange
an
early
day
had
been
fixed
for
his
arrival
for
i
thought
it
might
be
of
service
to
him
to
be
introduced
to
the
field
of
his
labours
before
he
came
i
had
gone
about
among
the
people
explaining
to
them
some
of
my
reasons
for
leaving
them
sooner
than
i
had
intended
and
telling
them
a
little
about
my
successor
that
he
might
not
appear
among
them
quite
as
a
stranger
he
was
much
gratified
with
their
reception
of
him
and
had
no
fear
of
not
finding
himself
quite
at
home
with
them
i
promised
if
i
could
comfortably
manage
it
to
pay
them
a
short
visit
the
following
summer
and
as
the
weather
was
now
getting
quite
cold
hastened
our
preparations
for
departure
i
could
have
wished
that
turner
had
been
with
us
on
the
journey
but
he
had
been
absent
from
his
cure
to
the
full
extent
that
his
conscience
would
permit
and
i
had
not
urged
him
he
would
be
there
to
receive
us
and
we
had
got
so
used
to
the
management
of
connie
that
we
did
not
feel
much
anxiety
about
the
travelling
we
resolved
if
she
seemed
strong
enough
as
we
went
along
to
go
right
through
to
london
making
a
few
days
there
the
only
break
in
the
transit
it
was
a
bright
cold
morning
when
we
started
but
connie
could
now
bear
the
air
so
well
that
we
set
out
with
the
carriage
open
nor
had
we
occasion
to
close
it
the
first
part
of
our
railway
journey
was
very
pleasant
but
when
we
drew
near
london
we
entered
a
thick
fog
and
before
we
arrived
a
small
dense
november
rain
was
falling
connie
looked
a
little
dispirited
partly
from
weariness
but
no
doubt
from
the
change
in
the
weather
not
very
cheerful
this
connie
my
dear
i
said
no
papa
she
answered
but
we
are
going
home
you
it
set
me
thinking
as
i
had
often
been
set
thinking
before
always
with
fresh
discovery
and
a
new
colour
on
the
dawning
sky
of
hope
i
lay
back
in
the
carriage
and
thought
how
the
november
fog
this
evening
in
london
was
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
we
had
to
go
through
on
the
way
shadow
like
this
would
fall
upon
me
the
world
would
grow
dark
and
life
grow
weary
but
i
should
know
it
was
the
last
of
the
way
home
then
i
began
to
question
myself
wherein
the
idea
of
this
home
consisted
i
knew
that
my
soul
had
ever
yet
felt
the
discomfort
of
strangeness
more
or
less
in
the
midst
of
its
greatest
blessedness
i
knew
that
as
the
thought
of
water
to
the
thirsty
for
it
is
the
soul
far
more
than
the
body
that
thirsts
even
for
the
material
water
such
is
the
thought
of
home
to
the
wanderer
in
a
strange
country
as
the
weary
soul
pines
for
sleep
and
every
heart
for
the
cure
of
its
own
bitterness
so
my
heart
and
soul
had
often
pined
for
their
home
did
i
know
i
asked
myself
where
or
what
that
home
was
it
could
consist
in
no
change
of
place
or
of
circumstance
no
mere
absence
of
care
no
accumulation
of
repose
no
blessed
communion
even
with
those
whom
my
soul
loved
in
the
midst
of
it
all
i
should
be
longing
for
a
homelier
home
one
into
which
i
might
enter
with
a
sense
of
infinitely
more
absolute
peace
than
a
conscious
child
could
know
in
the
arms
upon
the
bosom
of
his
mother
in
the
closest
contact
of
human
soul
with
human
soul
when
all
the
atmosphere
of
thought
was
rosy
with
love
again
and
yet
again
on
the
far
horizon
would
the
dun
lurid
flame
of
unrest
shoot
for
a
moment
through
the
enchanted
air
and
psyche
would
know
that
not
yet
had
she
reached
her
home
as
i
thought
this
i
lifted
my
eyes
and
saw
those
of
my
wife
and
connie
fixed
on
mine
as
if
they
were
reproaching
me
for
saying
in
my
soul
that
i
could
not
be
quite
at
home
with
them
then
i
said
in
my
heart
come
home
with
me
beloved
there
is
but
one
home
for
us
all
when
we
find
in
proportion
as
each
of
us
finds
that
home
shall
we
be
gardens
of
delight
to
each
other
little
chambers
of
rest
galleries
of
pictures
wells
of
again
what
was
this
home
god
himself
his
thoughts
his
will
his
love
his
judgment
are
man
s
home
to
think
his
thoughts
to
choose
his
will
to
love
his
loves
to
judge
his
judgments
and
thus
to
know
that
he
is
in
us
with
us
is
to
be
at
home
and
to
pass
through
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
is
the
way
home
but
only
thus
that
as
all
changes
have
hitherto
led
us
nearer
to
this
home
the
knowledge
of
god
so
this
greatest
of
all
outward
changes
for
it
is
but
an
outward
change
will
surely
usher
us
into
a
region
where
there
will
be
fresh
possibilities
of
drawing
nigh
in
heart
soul
and
mind
to
the
father
of
us
it
is
the
father
the
mother
that
make
for
the
child
his
home
indeed
i
doubt
if
the
is
complete
to
the
parents
of
a
family
themselves
when
they
remember
that
their
fathers
and
mothers
have
vanished
at
this
point
something
rose
in
me
seeking
utterance
won
t
it
be
delightful
wife
i
began
to
see
our
fathers
and
mothers
such
a
long
way
back
in
heaven
but
ethelwyn
s
face
gave
so
little
response
that
i
felt
at
once
how
dreadful
a
thing
it
was
not
to
have
had
a
good
father
or
mother
i
do
not
know
what
would
have
become
of
me
but
for
a
good
father
i
wonder
how
anybody
ever
can
be
good
that
has
not
had
a
good
father
how
dreadful
not
to
be
a
good
father
or
good
mother
every
father
who
is
not
good
every
mother
who
is
not
good
just
makes
it
as
impossible
to
believe
in
god
as
it
can
be
made
but
he
is
our
one
good
father
and
does
not
leave
us
even
should
our
fathers
and
mothers
have
thus
forsaken
us
and
left
him
without
a
witness
here
the
evil
odour
of
invaded
my
nostrils
and
i
knew
that
london
was
about
us
a
few
moments
after
we
reached
the
station
where
a
carriage
was
waiting
to
take
us
to
our
hotel
dreary
was
the
change
from
the
stillness
and
sunshine
of
kilkhaven
to
the
fog
and
noise
of
london
but
connie
slept
better
that
night
than
she
had
slept
for
a
good
many
nights
before
after
breakfast
the
next
morning
i
said
to
wynnie
i
am
going
to
see
percivale
s
studio
my
dear
have
you
any
objection
to
going
with
me
no
papa
she
answered
blushing
i
have
never
seen
an
artist
s
studio
in
my
come
along
then
get
your
bonnet
at
once
it
rains
but
we
shall
take
a
cab
and
it
won
t
she
ran
off
and
was
ready
in
a
few
minutes
we
gave
the
driver
directions
and
set
off
it
was
a
long
drive
at
length
he
stopped
at
the
door
of
a
very
house
in
a
very
street
in
which
no
man
could
possibly
identify
his
own
door
except
by
the
number
i
knocked
a
woman
who
looked
at
once
dirty
and
cross
the
former
probably
the
cause
of
the
latter
opened
the
door
gave
a
bare
assent
to
my
question
whether
percivale
was
at
home
withdrew
to
her
den
with
the
words
and
left
us
to
find
our
own
way
up
the
two
flights
of
stairs
this
however
involved
no
great
difficulty
we
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
front
room
a
voice
cried
come
in
and
we
entered
percivale
in
a
short
velvet
coat
with
his
palette
on
his
thumb
advanced
to
meet
us
cordially
his
face
wore
a
slight
flush
which
i
attributed
solely
to
pleasure
and
nothing
to
any
awkwardness
in
receiving
us
in
such
a
poor
place
as
he
occupied
i
cast
my
eyes
round
the
room
any
romantic
notions
wynnie
might
have
indulged
concerning
the
marvels
of
a
studio
must
have
paled
considerably
at
the
first
glance
around
percivale
s
room
plainly
the
abode
if
not
of
poverty
then
of
although
i
suspected
both
a
common
room
with
no
carpet
save
a
square
in
front
of
the
fireplace
no
curtains
except
a
piece
of
something
like
drugget
nailed
flat
across
all
the
lower
half
of
the
window
to
make
the
light
fall
from
upwards
two
or
three
horsehair
chairs
nearly
worn
out
a
table
in
a
corner
littered
with
books
and
papers
a
horrible
at
the
present
moment
dressed
apparently
for
a
scarecrow
a
large
easel
on
which
stood
a
these
constituted
almost
the
whole
furniture
of
the
room
with
his
percivale
dusted
one
chair
for
wynnie
and
another
for
me
then
standing
before
us
he
said
this
is
a
very
shabby
place
to
receive
you
in
miss
walton
but
it
is
all
i
have
a
man
s
life
consisteth
not
in
the
abundance
of
the
things
he
possesses
i
ventured
to
say
thank
you
said
percivale
i
hope
not
it
is
well
for
me
it
should
it
is
well
for
the
richest
man
in
england
that
it
should
not
i
returned
if
it
were
not
so
the
man
who
could
eat
most
would
be
the
most
there
are
people
even
of
my
acquaintance
however
who
seem
to
think
it
no
doubt
but
happily
their
thinking
so
will
not
make
it
so
even
for
have
you
been
very
busy
since
you
left
us
percivale
asked
wynnie
tolerably
he
answered
but
i
have
not
much
to
show
for
it
that
on
the
easel
is
all
i
hardly
like
to
let
you
look
at
it
why
asked
wynnie
first
because
the
subject
is
painful
next
because
it
is
so
unfinished
that
none
but
a
painter
could
do
it
but
why
should
you
paint
subjects
you
would
not
like
people
to
look
at
i
very
much
want
people
to
look
at
why
not
us
then
said
wynnie
because
you
do
not
need
to
be
are
you
sure
it
is
good
for
you
to
pain
anybody
i
said
good
is
done
by
pain
is
it
not
he
asked
undoubtedly
but
whether
are
wise
enough
to
know
when
and
where
and
how
much
is
the
of
course
i
do
not
make
the
pain
my
if
it
comes
only
as
a
necessary
accompaniment
that
may
alter
the
matter
greatly
i
said
but
still
i
am
not
sure
that
anything
in
which
the
pain
predominates
can
be
useful
in
the
best
perhaps
not
he
will
you
look
at
the
daub
with
much
pleasure
i
replied
and
we
rose
and
stood
before
the
easel
percivale
made
no
remark
but
left
us
to
find
out
what
the
picture
meant
nor
had
i
long
to
look
before
i
understood
it
in
a
measure
at
least
it
represented
a
in
a
wretchedly
ruinous
condition
the
plaster
had
come
away
in
several
places
and
through
between
the
laths
in
one
spot
hung
the
tail
of
a
great
rat
in
a
dark
corner
lay
a
man
dying
a
woman
sat
by
his
side
with
her
eyes
fixed
not
on
his
face
though
she
held
his
hand
in
hers
but
on
the
open
door
where
in
the
gloom
you
could
just
see
the
struggles
of
two
undertaker
s
men
to
get
the
coffin
past
the
turn
of
the
landing
towards
the
door
through
the
window
there
was
one
peep
of
the
blue
sky
whence
a
ray
of
sunlight
fell
on
the
one
scarlet
blossom
of
a
geranium
in
a
broken
pot
on
the
outside
i
do
not
wonder
you
did
not
like
to
show
it
i
said
how
can
you
bear
to
paint
such
a
dreadful
picture
it
is
a
true
one
it
only
represents
a
all
facts
have
not
a
right
to
be
surely
you
would
not
get
rid
of
painful
things
by
huddling
them
out
of
sight
no
nor
yet
by
gloating
upon
you
will
believe
me
that
it
gives
me
anything
but
pleasure
to
paint
such
pictures
as
far
as
the
subject
goes
he
said
with
some
discomposure
of
course
i
know
you
well
enough
by
this
time
to
know
that
but
no
one
could
hang
it
on
his
wall
who
would
not
either
gloat
on
suffering
or
grow
callous
to
it
whence
then
would
come
the
good
i
can
not
doubt
you
propose
to
yourself
as
your
object
in
painting
the
picture
if
it
had
come
into
my
possession
i
would
put
it
in
the
fire
suggested
percivale
with
a
strange
smile
no
still
less
would
i
sell
it
i
would
hang
it
up
with
a
curtain
before
it
and
only
look
at
it
now
and
then
when
i
thought
my
heart
was
in
danger
of
growing
hardened
to
the
sufferings
of
my
and
forgetting
that
they
need
the
i
could
not
wish
it
a
better
fate
that
would
answer
my
would
it
now
is
it
not
rather
those
who
care
little
or
nothing
about
such
matters
that
you
would
like
to
influence
would
you
be
content
with
one
solitary
person
like
me
and
remember
i
wouldn
t
buy
it
i
would
rather
not
have
it
i
could
hardly
bear
to
know
it
was
in
my
house
i
am
certain
you
can
not
do
people
good
by
showing
them
the
painful
make
it
as
painful
as
you
will
but
put
some
hope
into
it
something
to
show
that
action
is
worth
taking
in
the
affair
from
mere
suffering
people
will
turn
away
and
you
can
not
blame
them
every
show
of
it
without
hinting
at
some
door
of
escape
only
urges
them
to
forget
it
all
why
should
they
be
pained
if
it
can
do
no
good
for
the
sake
of
sympathy
i
should
say
answered
percivale
they
would
rejoin
it
is
only
a
picture
come
no
give
people
hope
if
you
would
have
them
act
at
all
in
i
was
almost
hoping
you
would
read
the
picture
rather
differently
you
see
there
is
a
bit
of
blue
sky
up
there
and
a
bit
of
sunshiny
scarlet
in
the
he
looked
at
me
curiously
as
he
spoke
i
can
read
it
so
for
myself
and
have
metamorphosed
its
meaning
so
but
you
only
put
in
the
sky
and
the
scarlet
to
heighten
the
perplexity
and
make
the
other
look
more
now
i
know
that
as
an
artist
i
have
succeeded
however
i
may
have
failed
otherwise
i
did
so
mean
it
but
knowing
you
would
dislike
the
picture
i
almost
hoped
in
my
cowardice
as
i
said
that
you
would
read
your
own
meaning
into
wynnie
had
not
said
a
word
as
i
turned
away
from
the
picture
i
saw
that
she
was
looking
quite
distressed
but
whether
by
the
picture
or
the
freedom
with
which
i
had
remarked
upon
it
i
do
not
know
my
eyes
falling
on
a
little
sketch
in
sepia
i
began
to
examine
it
in
the
hope
of
finding
something
more
pleasant
to
say
i
perceived
in
a
moment
however
that
it
was
nearly
the
same
thought
only
treated
in
a
gentler
and
more
poetic
mode
a
girl
lay
dying
on
her
bed
a
youth
held
her
hand
a
torrent
of
summer
sunshine
fell
through
the
window
and
made
a
lake
of
glory
upon
the
floor
i
turned
away
you
like
that
better
don
t
you
papa
said
wynnie
tremulously
it
is
beautiful
certainly
i
answered
and
if
it
were
only
one
i
should
enjoy
it
as
a
mood
but
coming
after
the
other
it
seems
but
the
same
thing
more
weakly
i
confess
i
was
a
little
vexed
for
i
had
got
much
interested
in
percivale
for
his
own
sake
as
well
as
for
my
daughter
s
and
i
had
expected
better
things
from
him
but
i
saw
that
i
had
gone
too
far
i
beg
your
pardon
percivale
i
said
i
fear
i
have
been
too
free
in
my
remarks
i
know
likewise
that
i
am
a
clergyman
and
not
a
painter
and
therefore
incapable
of
giving
the
praise
which
i
have
little
doubt
your
art
at
least
i
trust
that
honesty
can
not
offend
me
however
much
and
justly
it
may
pain
but
now
i
have
said
my
worst
i
should
much
like
to
see
what
else
you
have
at
hand
to
show
unfortunately
i
have
too
much
at
hand
let
me
he
strode
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
where
several
pictures
were
leaning
against
the
wall
with
their
faces
turned
towards
it
from
these
he
chose
one
but
before
showing
it
fitted
it
into
an
empty
frame
that
stood
beside
he
then
brought
it
forward
and
set
it
on
the
easel
i
will
describe
it
and
then
my
reader
will
understand
the
admiration
which
broke
from
me
after
i
had
regarded
it
for
a
time
a
dark
hill
rose
against
the
evening
sky
which
shone
through
a
few
thin
pines
on
its
top
along
a
road
on
the
four
squires
bore
a
dying
knight
a
man
past
the
middle
age
one
behind
carried
his
helm
and
another
led
his
horse
whose
fine
head
only
appeared
in
the
picture
the
head
and
countenance
of
the
knight
were
very
noble
telling
of
many
a
battle
and
ever
for
the
right
the
last
had
doubtless
been
gained
for
one
might
read
victory
as
well
as
peace
in
the
dying
look
the
party
had
just
reached
the
edge
of
a
steep
descent
from
which
you
saw
the
valley
beneath
with
the
last
of
the
harvest
just
being
reaped
while
the
shocks
stood
all
about
in
the
fields
under
the
place
of
the
sunset
the
sun
had
been
down
for
some
little
time
there
was
no
gold
left
in
the
sky
only
a
little
dull
saffron
but
plenty
of
that
lovely
liquid
green
of
the
autumn
sky
divided
with
a
few
streaks
of
pale
rose
the
depth
of
the
sky
overhead
which
you
could
not
see
for
the
arrangement
of
the
picture
was
mirrored
lovelily
in
a
piece
of
water
that
lay
in
the
centre
of
the
valley
my
dear
fellow
i
cried
why
did
you
not
show
me
this
first
and
save
me
from
saying
so
many
unkind
things
here
is
a
picture
to
my
own
heart
it
is
glorious
look
here
wynnie
i
went
on
you
see
it
is
evening
the
sun
s
work
is
done
and
he
has
set
in
glory
leaving
his
good
name
behind
him
in
a
lovely
harmony
of
colour
the
old
knight
s
work
is
done
too
his
day
has
set
in
the
storm
of
battle
and
he
is
lying
lapt
in
the
coming
peace
they
are
bearing
him
home
to
his
couch
and
his
grave
look
at
their
faces
in
the
dusky
light
they
are
all
mourning
for
and
honouring
the
life
that
is
ebbing
away
but
he
is
gathered
to
his
fathers
like
a
shock
of
corn
fully
ripe
and
so
the
harvest
stands
golden
in
the
valley
beneath
the
picture
would
not
be
complete
however
if
it
did
not
tell
us
of
the
deep
heaven
overhead
the
symbol
of
that
heaven
whither
he
who
has
done
his
work
is
bound
what
a
lovely
idea
to
represent
it
by
means
of
the
water
the
heaven
embodying
itself
in
the
earth
as
it
were
that
we
may
see
it
and
observe
how
that
dusky
and
those
tall
slender
pines
with
that
sorrowful
sky
between
lead
the
eye
and
point
the
heart
upward
towards
that
heaven
it
is
indeed
a
grand
picture
full
of
feeling
a
picture
and
a
footnote
this
is
a
description
from
memory
only
of
a
picture
painted
by
arthur
hughes
i
looked
at
the
girl
her
eyes
were
full
of
tears
either
called
forth
by
the
picture
itself
or
by
the
pleasure
of
finding
percivale
s
work
appreciated
by
me
who
had
spoken
so
hardly
of
the
others
i
can
not
tell
you
how
glad
i
am
that
you
like
it
she
said
like
it
i
returned
i
am
simply
delighted
with
it
more
than
i
can
express
so
much
delighted
that
if
i
could
have
this
alongside
of
it
i
should
not
mind
hanging
that
other
that
hopeless
garret
on
the
most
public
wall
i
then
said
wynnie
bravely
though
in
a
tremulous
voice
you
confess
don
t
you
papa
that
you
were
hard
on
percivale
at
first
not
too
hard
on
his
picture
my
dear
and
that
was
all
he
had
yet
given
me
to
judge
by
no
man
should
paint
a
picture
like
that
you
are
not
bound
to
disseminate
hopelessness
for
where
there
is
no
hope
there
can
be
no
sense
of
but
surely
papa
percivale
has
sense
of
duty
said
wynnie
in
an
almost
angry
tone
assuredly
my
love
therefore
i
argue
that
he
has
some
hope
and
therefore
again
that
he
has
no
right
to
publish
such
a
at
the
word
percivale
smiled
but
wynnie
went
on
with
her
defence
but
you
see
papa
that
percivale
does
not
paint
such
pictures
only
look
at
the
yes
my
dear
but
pictures
are
not
like
poems
lying
side
by
side
in
the
same
book
so
that
the
one
can
counteract
the
other
the
one
of
these
might
go
to
the
stormy
hebrides
and
the
other
to
the
vale
of
avalon
but
even
then
i
should
be
strongly
inclined
to
criticise
the
poem
whatever
position
it
stood
in
that
had
positively
nothing
of
the
aurora
in
here
let
me
interrupt
the
course
of
our
conversation
to
illustrate
it
by
a
remark
on
a
poem
which
has
appeared
within
the
last
twelvemonth
from
the
pen
of
the
greatest
living
poet
and
one
who
if
i
may
dare
to
judge
will
continue
the
greatest
for
many
many
years
to
come
it
is
only
a
little
song
i
stood
on
a
tower
in
the
i
have
found
few
men
who
whether
from
the
influence
of
those
prints
which
are
always
on
the
outlook
for
something
to
ridicule
or
from
some
other
cause
did
not
laugh
at
the
poem
i
thought
and
think
it
a
lovely
poem
although
i
am
not
quite
sure
of
the
transposition
of
words
in
the
last
two
lines
but
i
do
not
of
the
poem
just
because
there
is
no
hope
in
it
it
lacks
that
touch
or
hint
of
which
is
as
essential
i
think
to
every
poem
as
to
every
picture
the
the
one
pure
colour
in
his
hopeful
moods
let
a
man
put
on
his
singing
robes
and
chant
aloud
the
words
of
gladness
or
of
grief
i
care
not
which
to
his
fellows
in
his
hours
of
hopelessness
let
him
utter
his
thoughts
only
to
his
inarticulate
violin
or
in
the
evanescent
sounds
of
any
his
other
stringed
instrument
let
him
commune
with
his
own
heart
on
his
bed
and
be
still
let
him
speak
to
god
face
to
face
if
he
may
only
he
can
not
do
that
and
continue
hopeless
but
let
him
not
sing
aloud
in
such
a
mood
into
the
hearts
of
his
fellows
for
he
can
not
do
them
much
good
thereby
if
it
were
a
fact
that
there
is
no
hope
it
would
not
be
a
no
doubt
if
it
were
a
fact
it
ought
to
be
known
but
who
will
dare
be
confident
that
there
is
no
hope
therefore
i
say
let
the
hopeless
moods
at
least
if
not
the
hopeless
men
be
silent
he
could
refuse
to
let
the
one
go
without
the
other
said
wynnie
now
you
are
talking
like
a
child
wynnie
as
indeed
all
partisans
do
at
the
best
he
might
sell
them
together
but
the
owner
would
part
if
you
will
allow
me
i
will
come
and
see
both
the
pictures
again
percivale
assured
me
of
welcome
and
we
parted
i
declining
to
look
at
any
more
pictures
that
day
but
not
till
we
had
arranged
that
he
should
dine
with
us
in
the
evening
chapter
xiii
home
again
i
will
not
detain
my
readers
with
the
record
of
the
few
days
we
spent
in
london
in
writing
the
account
of
it
as
in
the
experience
of
the
time
itself
i
feel
that
i
am
near
home
and
grow
the
more
anxious
to
reach
it
ah
i
am
growing
a
little
anxious
after
another
home
too
for
the
house
of
my
tabernacle
is
falling
to
ruins
about
me
what
a
word
is
to
think
that
god
has
made
the
world
so
that
you
have
only
to
be
born
in
a
certain
place
and
live
long
enough
in
it
to
get
at
the
secret
of
it
and
henceforth
that
place
is
to
you
a
with
all
the
wonderful
meaning
in
the
word
thus
the
whole
earth
is
a
home
to
the
race
for
every
spot
of
it
shares
in
the
feeling
some
one
of
the
family
loves
it
as
home
how
rich
the
earth
seems
when
we
so
regard
it
crowded
with
the
loves
of
home
yet
i
am
now
getting
ready
to
to
leave
this
world
of
homes
and
go
home
when
i
reach
that
home
shall
i
even
then
seek
yet
to
go
home
even
then
i
believe
i
shall
seek
a
yet
warmer
deeper
truer
home
in
the
deeper
knowledge
of
god
in
the
truer
love
of
my
eternity
will
be
my
heart
and
my
faith
tell
me
a
travelling
homeward
but
in
jubilation
and
confidence
and
the
vision
of
the
beloved
when
we
had
laid
connie
once
more
in
her
own
room
at
least
the
room
which
since
her
illness
had
come
to
be
called
hers
i
went
up
to
my
study
the
familiar
faces
of
my
books
welcomed
me
i
threw
myself
in
my
and
gazed
around
me
with
pleasure
i
felt
it
so
homely
here
all
my
old
friends
whom
somehow
i
hoped
to
see
some
day
present
there
in
the
spirit
ready
to
talk
with
me
any
moment
when
i
was
in
the
mood
making
no
claim
upon
my
attention
when
i
was
not
i
felt
as
if
i
should
like
when
the
hour
should
come
to
die
in
that
chair
and
pass
into
the
society
of
the
witnesses
in
the
presence
of
the
tokens
they
had
left
behind
them
i
heard
shouts
on
the
stair
and
in
rushed
the
two
boys
papa
papa
they
were
crying
together
what
is
the
matter
we
ve
found
the
big
chest
just
where
we
left
well
did
you
expect
it
would
have
taken
itself
off
but
there
s
everything
in
it
just
as
we
left
were
you
afraid
then
that
the
moment
you
left
it
it
would
turn
itself
upside
down
and
empty
itself
of
all
its
contents
on
the
floor
they
laughed
but
apparently
with
no
very
keen
appreciation
of
the
attempt
at
a
joke
well
papa
i
did
not
think
anything
about
it
but
but
but
there
everything
is
as
we
left
with
this
triumphant
answer
they
turned
and
hurried
a
little
abashed
out
of
the
room
but
not
many
moments
elapsed
before
the
sounds
that
arose
from
them
were
sufficiently
reassuring
as
to
the
state
of
their
spirits
when
they
were
gone
i
forgot
my
books
in
the
attempt
to
penetrate
and
understand
the
condition
of
my
boys
thoughts
and
i
soon
came
to
see
that
they
were
right
and
i
was
wrong
it
was
the
movement
of
that
undeveloped
something
in
us
which
makes
it
possible
for
us
in
everything
to
give
thanks
it
was
the
wonder
of
the
discovery
of
the
existence
of
law
there
was
nothing
that
they
could
understand
to
necessitate
the
remaining
of
the
things
where
they
had
left
them
no
doubt
there
was
a
reason
in
the
nature
of
god
why
all
things
should
hold
together
whence
springs
the
law
of
gravitation
as
we
call
it
but
as
far
as
the
boys
could
understand
of
this
all
things
might
as
well
have
been
arranged
for
flying
asunder
so
that
no
one
could
expect
to
find
anything
where
he
had
left
it
i
began
to
see
yet
further
into
the
truth
that
in
everything
we
must
give
thanks
and
whatever
is
not
of
faith
is
sin
even
the
laws
of
nature
reveal
the
character
of
god
not
merely
as
regards
their
ends
but
as
regards
their
kind
being
of
necessity
fashioned
after
ideal
facts
of
his
own
being
and
will
i
rose
and
went
down
to
see
if
everybody
was
getting
settled
and
how
the
place
looked
i
found
ethel
already
going
about
the
house
as
if
she
had
never
left
it
and
as
if
we
all
had
just
returned
from
a
long
absence
and
she
had
to
show
us
wynnie
had
vanished
but
i
found
her
by
and
by
in
the
favourite
haunt
of
her
mother
before
her
marriage
beside
the
little
pond
called
the
bishop
s
basin
of
which
i
do
not
think
i
have
ever
told
my
readers
the
legend
but
why
should
i
mention
it
for
i
can
not
tell
it
now
the
frost
lay
thick
in
the
hollow
when
i
went
down
there
to
find
her
the
branches
lately
clothed
with
leaves
stood
bare
and
icy
around
her
ethelwyn
and
i
had
almost
forgotten
that
there
was
anything
out
of
the
common
in
connection
with
the
house
the
horror
of
this
mysterious
spot
had
laid
hold
upon
wynnie
i
resolved
that
that
night
i
would
in
her
mother
s
presence
tell
her
all
the
legend
of
the
place
and
the
whole
story
of
how
i
won
her
mother
i
did
so
and
i
think
it
made
her
trust
us
more
but
now
i
left
her
there
and
went
to
connie
she
lay
in
her
bed
for
her
mother
had
got
her
thither
at
once
a
perfect
picture
of
blessed
comfort
there
was
no
occasion
to
be
uneasy
about
her
i
was
so
pleased
to
be
at
home
again
with
such
good
hopes
that
i
could
not
rest
but
went
wandering
everywhere
into
places
even
which
i
had
not
entered
for
ten
years
at
least
and
found
fresh
interest
in
everything
for
this
was
home
and
here
i
was
now
i
fancy
my
readers
looking
forward
to
the
end
and
seeing
what
a
small
amount
of
print
is
left
blaming
me
some
that
i
have
roused
curiosity
without
satisfying
it
others
that
i
have
kept
them
so
long
over
a
dull
book
and
a
lame
conclusion
but
out
of
a
life
one
can
not
always
cut
complete
portions
and
serve
them
up
in
nice
shapes
i
am
well
aware
that
i
have
not
told
them
the
as
some
of
them
would
call
it
of
either
of
my
daughters
this
i
can
not
develop
now
even
as
far
as
it
is
known
to
me
but
if
it
is
any
satisfaction
to
them
to
know
this
much
and
it
will
be
all
that
some
of
them
mean
by
i
fear
i
may
as
well
tell
them
now
that
wynnie
has
been
percivale
for
many
years
with
a
history
well
worth
recounting
and
that
connie
has
had
a
quiet
happy
life
for
nearly
as
long
as
turner
she
has
never
got
strong
but
has
very
tolerable
health
her
husband
watches
her
with
the
utmost
care
and
devotion
my
ethelwyn
is
still
with
me
harry
is
gone
home
charlie
is
a
barrister
of
the
middle
temple
and
dora
i
must
not
forget
dora
well
i
will
say
nothing
about
her
for
good
reasons
it
is
not
quite
determined
yet
meantime
she
puts
up
with
the
society
of
her
old
father
and
mother
and
is
something
else
than
unhappy
i
fully
believe
and
connie
s
baby
asks
some
one
out
of
ten
thousand
readers
i
have
no
time
to
tell
you
about
her
now
but
as
you
know
her
so
little
it
can
not
be
such
a
trial
to
remain
for
a
time
at
least
unenlightened
with
regard
to
her
the
only
other
part
of
my
history
which
could
contain
anything
like
incident
enough
to
make
it
interesting
in
print
is
a
period
i
spent
in
london
some
few
years
after
the
time
of
which
i
have
now
been
writing
but
i
am
getting
too
old
to
regard
the
commencement
of
another
history
with
composure
the
labour
of
thinking
into
sequences
even
the
bodily
labour
of
writing
grows
more
and
more
severe
i
fancy
i
can
think
correctly
still
but
the
effort
necessary
to
express
myself
with
corresponding
correctness
becomes
in
prospect
at
least
sometimes
almost
appalling
i
must
therefore
take
leave
of
my
patient
reader
for
surely
every
one
who
has
followed
me
through
all
that
i
have
here
written
well
deserves
the
epithet
as
if
the
probability
that
i
shall
write
no
more
were
a
certainty
bidding
him
farewell
with
one
word
friend
hope
thou
in
god
and
for
a
parting
gift
offering
him
a
new
and
i
think
a
true
rendering
of
the
first
verse
of
the
eleventh
chapter
of
the
epistle
to
the
hebrews
now
faith
is
the
essence
of
hopes
the
trying
of
things
the
end
