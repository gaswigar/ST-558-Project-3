i
christmas
at
holly
hill
holly
hill
was
a
place
for
christmas
holly
hill
the
old
rambling
stratford
homestead
in
virginia
on
its
high
hill
looking
down
the
long
slope
and
across
the
wide
fields
to
the
far
woods
rimming
the
sky
from
bob
the
veteran
within
a
month
of
his
teens
down
to
evelyn
with
her
golden
hair
floating
all
around
her
when
christmas
came
everyone
hung
up
a
stocking
and
the
visit
of
santa
claus
was
the
event
of
the
year
they
went
to
sleep
the
night
before
christmas
or
rather
they
went
to
bed
for
sleep
was
long
far
from
their
bright
eyes
with
delightful
expectations
and
thrills
along
their
backs
and
with
little
squeakings
and
gurglings
like
so
many
little
white
mice
and
if
santa
claus
had
not
always
been
so
very
prompt
in
disappearing
up
the
chimney
before
daybreak
he
must
certainly
have
been
caught
for
by
the
time
the
chickens
were
crowing
in
the
morning
there
would
be
an
answering
twitter
through
the
house
and
with
a
patter
of
little
feet
and
subdued
laughter
small
figures
would
steal
through
the
dim
light
of
dusky
rooms
and
cold
passages
opening
doors
with
sudden
bursts
and
shouting
christmas
gift
into
darkened
chambers
at
still
sleeping
elders
then
they
would
scurry
away
in
the
gray
light
to
rake
open
the
hickory
embers
and
revel
in
the
exploration
of
their
bulging
overcrowded
stockings
not
columbus
was
to
be
envied
when
those
discoveries
were
being
made
what
was
a
new
world
to
those
treasures
the
thrill
of
the
new
remains
after
forty
years
it
had
four
blades
each
worth
a
province
envy
columbus
perish
the
thought
such
was
christmas
morning
at
holly
hill
in
the
old
times
before
the
war
those
times
of
memory
and
romance
thus
it
was
that
at
christmas
when
the
blockading
lines
were
drawn
close
and
there
were
no
new
toys
to
be
had
for
love
or
money
there
were
much
disappointment
and
some
murmurs
at
holly
hill
the
children
had
never
really
felt
the
war
until
then
though
their
father
major
stafford
had
been
off
first
with
his
company
and
then
with
his
regiment
since
april
war
was
on
the
whole
a
pleasant
experience
to
the
boys
so
many
strangers
came
by
battles
were
so
interesting
and
there
was
a
bare
chance
of
their
seeing
one
in
which
bob
was
to
lead
a
charge
and
capture
the
commanding
general
but
when
christmas
came
and
there
were
no
presents
no
real
presents
war
was
realized
it
was
a
terrible
thing
from
stafford
down
to
little
tot
evelyn
there
was
an
absence
of
the
merriment
which
christmas
always
brought
with
it
the
children
mother
had
done
all
she
could
to
collect
such
presents
as
were
within
her
reach
but
the
youngsters
were
much
too
sharp
not
to
know
that
the
presents
were
just
fixed
up
and
when
they
were
all
gathered
around
the
fire
in
their
chamber
that
christmas
morning
looking
over
their
presents
their
little
faces
wore
an
expression
of
pathetic
disappointment
i
do
think
much
of
christmas
announced
freckled
ran
with
characteristic
gravity
looking
down
on
his
poor
presents
with
an
air
of
contempt
a
hatchet
a
lot
of
old
nails
and
a
much
stafford
smiled
but
the
smile
soon
died
away
into
an
expression
of
sadness
i
too
have
to
do
without
my
christmas
gift
she
said
your
father
wrote
me
that
he
hoped
to
spend
christmas
with
us
and
he
has
not
come
he
has
been
ordered
over
to
the
potomac
never
mind
he
may
come
yet
said
bob
encouragingly
he
always
does
what
he
says
he
going
to
do
bob
always
was
encouraging
that
was
why
he
was
old
bob
an
axe
was
just
the
thing
i
wanted
mamma
said
he
shouldering
his
new
possession
proudly
and
striking
the
attitude
of
a
woodman
striding
off
now
i
can
make
an
abatis
stafford
face
lit
up
again
he
was
a
sturdy
boy
with
eyes
and
a
good
mouth
and
a
hatchet
was
what
i
wanted
admitted
ran
affected
by
the
example
besides
there
are
a
lot
of
nails
now
i
can
make
my
own
an
i
like
a
broked
knife
asserted
charlie
stoutly
falling
valiantly
into
the
general
movement
while
evelyn
pushed
her
long
hair
out
of
her
eyes
and
hugged
her
baby
declaring
i
love
my
dolly
and
i
love
santa
tlaus
an
i
love
my
papa
at
which
her
mother
took
the
little
midget
to
her
bosom
broken
doll
and
all
and
hid
her
face
in
her
tangled
curls
ii
major
stafford
comes
home
the
end
of
that
christmas
was
better
than
the
beginning
major
stafford
justified
bob
confidence
the
holiday
was
not
quite
over
when
one
evening
major
stafford
galloped
up
to
the
gate
through
the
mist
his
black
horse
ajax
splashed
with
mud
to
his
he
had
ridden
him
seventy
miles
that
day
to
keep
that
tryst
the
major
soon
heard
all
about
the
little
ones
disappointment
at
not
receiving
any
new
presents
santa
tlaus
didn
tum
this
trismas
but
he
tummin
trismas
said
evelyn
looking
wisely
up
at
him
that
evening
from
the
rug
where
she
was
vainly
trying
to
make
her
doll
head
stick
on
her
broken
shoulders
and
why
did
he
not
come
this
christmas
miss
wisdom
laughed
her
father
touching
her
caressingly
with
the
toe
of
his
boot
tause
the
yankees
would
let
him
said
she
gravely
holding
her
doll
up
and
looking
at
it
pensively
her
head
on
one
side
and
why
then
should
he
come
next
year
taus
god
goin
to
make
him
she
turned
the
mutilated
baby
around
and
examined
it
gravely
with
her
shining
head
still
set
on
the
other
side
there
faith
for
you
said
stafford
her
husband
asked
the
child
how
do
you
know
this
tause
god

answered
evelyn
still
busy
with
her
inspection
he
did
when
night
when
i
saw
him
you
saw
him
um
hm
nodding
her
head
cheerfully
well
i
knew
she
was
an
angel
said
major
stafford
in
an
aside
to
his
wife
but
what
did
he
say
santa
claus
is
going
to
bring
you
he
asked
the
little
mite
sprang
to
her
feet
he
goin
to
bring
me
a
great
big
dolly
with
real
hair
and
blue
eyes
that
will
go
to
sleep
and
her
name
miss
her
face
was
aglow
and
she
stretched
her
plump
hands
wide
apart
to
give
the
size
she
has
dreamt
it
said
the
major
in
an
undertone
to
her
mother
there
is
not
such
a
doll
as
that
in
the
southern
confederacy
the
child
caught
his
meaning
yes
he
she
insisted
i
asked
him
an
he
said
he
would
and
charlie
just
then
that
youngster
burst
into
the
room
a
small
whirlwind
in
petticoats
as
soon
as
his
cyclonic
tendencies
could
be
curbed
his
father
asked
him
well
what
did
you
ask
santa
claus
for
young
man
for
a
pair
of
breeches
and
a
sword
answered
the
boy
promptly
striking
an
attitude
and
i
going
to
have
i
told
him
i
just
had
to
have
well
upon
my
word
laughed
his
father
eyeing
the
erect
little
figure
and
the
steady
clear
eyes
which
looked
proudly
up
at
him
i
had
no
idea
what
a
young
achilles
we
had
here
you
shall
have
them
the
boy
nodded
gravely
all
right
when
i
get
to
be
a
man
i
let
anybody
make
my
mamma
cry
he
advanced
a
step
with
head
up
the
very
picture
of
spirit
ah
you
wo
said
his
father
with
a
gesture
to
prevent
his
wife
interrupting
nor
my
little
sister
said
the
young
warrior
patronizingly
swelling
with
infantile
importance
no
he
wo
let
anybody
make
ky
chimed
in
evelyn
promptly
accepting
the
proffered
protection
and
he
wo

demanded
charlie
on
my
word

of

old

said
major
stafford
laughing
much
pleased

my
young
knight
he
drew
the
boy
up
to
him
and
stood
him
before

i

charlie
nodded
in
token
of
his
acceptance
of
the
condition
all
right
but
she
be
a
crybaby
he
added
with
a
glance
down
at
evelyn
iii
major
stafford
gets
the
christmas
presents
when
major
stafford
galloped
away
next
day
on
his
return
to
his
command
the
little
group
at
the
shouted
many
messages
after
him
the
last
thing
he
heard
was
charlie
treble
as
he
seated
himself
on
the
calling
to
him
not
to
forget
to
make
santa
claus
bring
him
a
pair
of
uniform
breeches
and
a
sword
and
little
voice
came
to
him
long
after
he
could
distinguish
the
words
but
he
knew
she
was
reminding
him
of
her
dolly
that
can
go
to
sleep
many
times
during
the
ensuing
year
amid
the
hardships
of
the
campaign
the
privations
and
the
fatigues
of
the
march
and
the
dangers
of
battle
the
major
heard
those
little
voices
calling
to
him
in
the
autumn
he
won
the
three
stars
of
a
colonel
for
gallantry
in
leading
a
desperate
charge
on
a
town
in
the
heart
of
the
enemy
land
a
perilous
raid
had
been
made
deep
into
the
country
an
overwhelming
force
had
been
met
which
defeated
the
object
of
the
raid
and
threatened
the
destruction
of
the
entire
force
the
day
was
saved
by
major
stafford
but
none
knew
when
he
dashed
into
the
town
at
the
head
of
his
regiment
under
a
hail
of
bullets
that
his
mind
was
full
of
toyshops
and
and
that
when
he
was
so
stoutly
holding
his
position
he
was
guarding
a
little
boy
suit
a
small
sword
with
a
gilded
scabbard
and
a
large
doll
with
flowing
ringlets
and
blue
eyes
that
could
go
to
sleep
some
of
his
friends
during
that
year
charged
the
major
with
growing
miserly
and
rallied
him
upon
hoarding
up
his
pay
and
carrying
large
rolls
of
confederate
money
about
his
person
and
when
just
before
the
raid
he
invested
his
entire
year
pay
in
four
or
five
they
vowed
he
was
mad
i
shall
report
him
as
a
hopeless
case
said
graham
the
surgeon
a
man
might
have
reason
to
do
this
in
time
of
peace
but
when
a
man
hoards
money
on
his
person
and
then
exposes
himself
as
the
major
does
every
time
we
have
a
battle
it
proof
of
insanity
the
major
however
always
met
these
charges
with
a
smile
doctors
are
like
other
men
he
said
they
think
whatever
they
can
not
understand
madness
and
as
soon
as
his
position
was
assured
in
the
captured
town
he
proved
his
sanity
the
fight
had
been
a
sharp
one
and
the
town
had
only
been
seized
after
a
desperate
charge
the
shopkeepers
had
put
up
their
shutters
and
were
barricaded
within
their
houses
while
bullets
were
hailing
and
light
were
cracking
at
length
it
grew
quiet
the
owner
of
a
handsome
store
on
the
principal
street
over
which
was
a
large
sign
men
and
boys
clothes
peeping
out
saw
a
confederate
major
ride
up
to
the
door
which
had
been
hastily
fastened
when
the
fight
began
and
rap
on
it
with
the
handle
of
his
sword
there
was
something
in
the
rap
that
was
imperative
and
the
owner
hastily
opened
the
door
the
officer
entered
good
evening
he
looked
all
about
him
ah
he
picked
up
a
little
uniform
suit
of
blue
cloth
with
brass
buttons
you
have
no
gray
ones
he
asked
with
a
smile
no
sir
no
use
for
what
is
the
price
of
this
ten
dollars
stammered
the
shopkeeper
but
you
can
have
it
for
nothing
if
you
will
keep
your
men
from
troubling
me
to
his
astonishment
the
confederate
officer
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
laid
a
gold
piece
on
the
counter
now
show
me
where
there
is
a
there
was
one
only
a
few
doors
off
and
the
shopkeeper
was
most
eager
to
show
it
but
the
officer
said
he
could
find
it
he
went
out
the
major
found
and
selected
a
boy
sword
handsomely
ornamented
and
the
most
beautiful
doll
over
whose
eyes
stole
the
whitest
of
roseleaf
eyelids
and
which
could
talk
as
dolls
talk
and
do
other
wonderful
things
he
astonished
this
shopkeeper
also
by
laying
down
another
this
left
him
but
two
or
three
more
of
the
proceeds
of
his
year
pay
and
these
he
soon
handed
over
a
counter
to
a
jeweller
who
gave
him
a
small
package
in
exchange
he
smiled
and
chatted
so
pleasantly
with
the
men
that
when
he
left
the
shopkeepers
all
had
new
ideas
of
at
least
one
rebel
officer
all
during
the
remainder
of
the
campaign
colonel
stafford
carried
a
package
carefully
sealed
and
strapped
on
behind
his
saddle
his
care
of
it
and
his
secrecy
about
it
were
the
subjects
of
many
jests
among
his
friends
in
the
brigade
and
when
in
an
engagement
his
horse
was
shot
and
the
colonel
under
a
hot
fire
stopped
and
calmly
unbuckled
his
bundle
and
during
the
rest
of
the
fight
carried
it
in
his
hand
there
was
a
clamor
afterward
that
he
should
disclose
the
contents
even
an
offer
to
sing
them
a
song
would
not
appease
his
friends
though
the
colonel
had
the
best
voice
in
the
brigade
they
must
know
his
secret
the
brigade
officers
were
gathered
around
a
that
night
on
the
edge
of
the
bloody
field
a
federal
officer
colonel
denby
who
had
been
slightly
wounded
and
captured
in
the
fight
and
who
now
sat
somewhat
grim
and
moody
before
the
fire
was
their
guest
now
stafford
open
the
bundle
and
let
us
into
the
secret
they
all
said
some
of
us
may
get
shot
before
we
know
it
the
colonel
without
a
word
but
with
softened
eyes
rose
and
going
to
his
saddle
which
lay
on
the
ground
near
by
brought
the
parcel
to
the
fire
kneeling
down
he
took
out
his
knife
and
carefully
opened
the
outer
cover
of
many
a
jest
was
levelled
at
him
across
the
blazing
logs
as
he
did
so
but
a
smile
was
on
his
face
and
the
federal
colonel
thought
to
himself
what
a
fine
face
it
was
one
said
the
colonel
had
turned
pedler
and
was
trying
to
eke
out
a
living
by
running
the
blockade
on
lilliputian
principles
another
wagered
that
he
had
it
full
of
confederate
bills
a
third
that
it
was
a
talisman
against
bullets
and
so
on
within
the
outer
covering
were
several
others
but
at
length
the
last
was
reached
as
the
colonel
ripped
carefully
the
group
gathered
around
and
bent
breathlessly
over
him
the
light
from
the
blazing
shining
ruddily
on
their
eager
faces
when
the
colonel
put
in
his
hand
and
drew
out
a
toy
sword
there
was
a
general
exclamation
but
when
he
took
the
doll
from
her
soft
wrapping
and
then
unrolled
and
held
up
a
tiny
jacket
and
a
pair
of
little
trousers
not
much
larger
than
a
man
hand
and
just
the
size
for
a
boy
there
was
a
dead
silence
and
the
men
turned
away
their
faces
from
the
fire
and
more
than
one
who
had
boys
of
his
own
at
home
put
his
hand
up
to
his
eyes
illustration
the
major
christmas
presents
one
of
them
the
bronzed
and
officer
who
had
charged
the
colonel
with
being
a
miser
and
who
wore
crepe
on
his
sleeve
stretched
himself
out
on
the
ground
flat
on
his
face
and
sobbed
as
colonel
stafford
gently
told
his
story
of
charlie
and
evelyn
even
the
grave
face
of
colonel
denby
looked
somewhat
changed
in
the
light
of
the
fire
and
he
reached
over
for
the
doll
may
i
see
it
certainly
a
half
dozen
hands
were
stretched
out
to
pass
it
to
him
he
handled
it
tenderly
i
too
have
a
little
one
at
home
he
said
in
a
low
voice
as
he
handed
the
doll
back
to
colonel
stafford
the
child
of
my
only
son
he
was
killed
at
genies
mill
that
night
colonel
stafford
and
colonel
denby
slept
under
the
same
blanket
iv
the
boys
learn
something
of
war
during
the
whole
year
the
children
had
been
looking
forward
to
the
coming
of
christmas
charlie
outbursts
of
petulance
and
not
rare
fits
of
anger
were
invariably
checked
if
any
mention
was
made
of
his
father
injunction
to
take
care
of
his
mother
and
little
sister
and
at
length
he
became
accustomed
to
curbing
himself
by
the
recollection
of
the
charge
he
had
received
if
he
fell
and
hurt
himself
even
badly
in
his
constant
attempts
to
climb
up
impossible
places
he
would
simply
snap
his
eyes
and
rub
himself
and
presently
say
proudly
i
do
cry
now
i
am
a
knight
and
next
christmas
i
am
going
to
be
a
man
my
papa
goin
to
tell
santa
claus
to
bring
me
a
pair
of
breeches
and
a
sword
evelyn
could
not
help
crying
when
she
was
hurt
for
she
was
only
a
very
little
girl
but
she
added
to
her
prayer
of
god
bless
and
keep
my
papa
and
bring
him
safe
home
the
petition
please
god
bless
and
keep
santa
tlaus
and
let
him
come
here
trismas
old
bob
and
ran
too
as
well
as
the
younger
ones
looked
forward
eagerly
to
christmas
but
this
year
brought
the
war
much
closer
to
holly
hill
heretofore
it
had
been
to
the
children
even
to
bob
something
dim
and
distant
like
a
cloud
on
the
horizon
with
grumblings
of
thunder
and
that
threatened
but
did
not
strike
but
now
it
swept
up
to
holly
hill
like
a
storm
then
like
a
flood
rolled
over
it
the
main
armies
passed
along
the
great
road
some
way
off
the
northern
troops
pushing
on
and
on
nearer
and
nearer
until
the
big
guns
could
be
heard
to
the
northward
making
the
ground
tremble
and
the
windows
shake
at
such
times
stafford
would
stop
and
listen
with
white
face
and
moving
lips
and
the
older
boys
would
stand
beside
her
and
count
the
reports
in
low
tones
for
they
knew
a
great
battle
was
being
fought
and
their
father
might
be
there
what
would
happen
in
case
their
side
was
beaten
and
had
to
fall
back
they
trembled
to
think
all
the
horses
would
be
taken
and
the
corn
that
would
mean
starvation
and
perhaps
the
house
might
be
burnt
they
had
heard
of
such
things
elsewhere
and
they
might
have
to
refugee
this
had
its
pleasant
side
for
the
boys
for
they
would
have
to
travel
south
and
maybe
camp
like
gypsies
or
the
young
marooners
bob
was
full
of
excitement
as
to
this
and
used
to
thrill
ran
telling
how
they
would
live
and
how
they
would
mount
guard
at
night
and
evade
their
pursuers
or
sometimes
make
a
stand
against
them
on
a
hill
or
at
a
stream
throwing
up
their
breastworks
and
holding
them
back
with
his
gun
while
their
mother
and
the
children
escaped
then
they
would
go
out
to
the
stable
and
seated
on
a
manger
talk
it
all
over
with
uncle
saunders
the
who
was
guide
philosopher
and
friend
to
them
uncle
saunders
would
sometimes
be
consoling
and
sometimes
almost
disappointing
they
goin
refugeein
like
a
parcel
of
gypsies
uncle
saunders
ideas
of
were
not
orthodox
but
no
danger
no
yankees
could
git
to
them
if
they
could
they
been
long
ago
reasoned
uncle
saunders
and
if
a
few
of
them
pesky
raiders
slipt
through
and
got
there
he
like
to
see
git
his
horses
he
jist
would
he
knew
a
place
he
could
hide
where
never
find
could
hardly
find
when
he
comes
to
blow
his
horn
this
at
least
was
exciting
and
bob
was
all
ears
he
seized
the
old
driver
by
the
arm
where
is
it
uncle
saunders
you
tell
please
i
wo
tell
a
soul
not
even
ran
you
know
i
wo
if
i
promise
but
no
uncle
saunders
shut
up
like
a
clam
as
tight
as
the
door
well
if
i
guess
will
you
tell
me
give
me
three
guesses
all
right
is
it
the
thick
pines
the
other
side
of
the
creek
where
the
old
mine
used
to
be
uncle
saunders
shook
his
head
well
is
it
the
big
marsh
with
the
high
willows
and
the
old
you
know
boy
i
ai
goin
to
teck
my
horses
my
black
george
and
blifil
into
dat
mash
well
strung
out
very
long
is
it
let
me
see
i
got
only
one
more
guess
have
i
i
ai
give
you
nothin
said
uncle
saunders
disappointingly
you
jist
guessin
around
heah
but
bob
insisted
that
by
letting
him
guess
twice
he
had
agreed
to
the
plan
and
in
fact
it
did
look
so
well
go
on
den
said
uncle
saunders
at
last
bob
after
long
thought
began
again
guilefully
watching
uncle
saunders
oracular
face
to
read
his
success
or
failure
by
his
expression
well
is
it
no
it
is
that
is
it
the
deep
no
i
do
want
to
ask
that
i
know
it
is
not
that
is
it
the
great
woods
this
with
a
jump
old
saunders
started
to
shake
his
head
and
then
looked
around
so
guilefully
to
see
that
nobody
was
in
that
bob
dropped
his
voice
to
its
most
mysterious
tone
as
he
whispered
is
that
it
it
may
be
doubted
whether
uncle
saunders
for
all
his
apparent
confiding
of
his
secret
to
bob
was
not
playing
a
game
with
him
and
merely
letting
him
suppose
he
had
guessed
his
secret
refuge
but
however
this
was
and
however
clever
he
was
at
acting
uncle
saunders
was
not
clever
enough
to
foretell
the
future
one
morning
as
uncle
saunders
was
on
his
way
to
the
stable
a
party
of
men
came
galloping
up
the
hill
from
toward
the
river
and
in
ten
minutes
all
uncle
plans
were
overthrown
and
his
horses
his
cherished
friends
were
being
led
away
amid
his
reproaches
and
the
lamentations
of
the
boys
sam
you
have
to
get
up
earlier
in
the
morning
than
this
to
get
ahead
of
us
laughed
one
of
the
men
dat
ai
my
name
said
uncle
saunders
curtly
you
think
so
much
of
your
horses
you
better
come
along
and
attend
to
them
we
pay
you
wages
and
set
you
free
uncle
saunders
shook
his
head
nor
i
goin
to
stay
right
heah
and
teck
keer
o
my
mistis
and
de
my
master
told
me

he

and
i
goin
to

till

your

till
then
we
are
going
on
to
richmond
you

said
bob
with
spirit
you
been
trying
to
get
there
for
over
three
years
and
have
done
it
no
little
johnny
we
have
yet
but
we
still
on
the
way
said
the
soldier
by
the
plantation
had
been
completely
overrun
and
all
that
day
the
troops
were
passing
by
it
began
to
look
after
a
little
as
if
bob
prediction
were
going
to
come
true
the
union
armies
did
not
reach
richmond
their
advance
was
stayed
a
few
miles
beyond
holly
hill
but
holly
hill
and
its
family
were
well
within
the
federal
lines
and
there
was
no
chance
of
being
reached
by
any
message
or
thing
from
the
other
side
of
the
line
the
roads
in
mud
were
filled
with
troops
in
blue
uniforms
marching
up
and
down
or
with
wagons
passing
backward
and
forward
piled
high
with
boxes
or
forage
the
children
grew
so
used
to
them
that
they
would
go
down
to
the
roadside
and
watch
them
as
they
passed
the
only
confederates
the
children
ever
saw
now
were
the
dejected
prisoners
who
were
being
passed
back
on
their
way
to
prison
the
only
news
they
ever
received
was
the
rumors
which
reached
them
from
federal
sources
stafford
heart
was
heavy
within
her
and
when
a
day
or
two
before
christmas
she
heard
charlie
and
evelyn
as
they
sat
before
the
fire
gravely
talking
of
the
presents
which
their
father
had
promised
that
santa
claus
should
bring
them
she
could
stand
it
no
longer
she
took
bob
and
ran
into
her
room
and
there
told
them
that
now
as
it
was
impossible
for
their
father
to
come
they
must
help
her
entertain
the
children
and
console
them
for
their
disappointment
the
two
boys
responded
heartily
as
true
boys
always
will
when
thrown
on
their
manliness
i
knew
he
could
not
get
here
said
ran
i
knew
no
one
else
could
but
papa
said
bob
but
i
hoped
he
might
he
can
do
so
many
things
no
one
else
can
do
stafford
shook
her
head
for
the
next
two
days
stafford
and
both
the
boys
were
busy
stafford
when
charlie
was
not
present
gave
her
time
to
cutting
out
and
making
a
little
gray
from
an
old
coat
her
husband
had
worn
when
he
first
entered
the
army
while
the
boys
employed
themselves
bob
in
making
a
pretty
little
sword
and
scabbard
out
of
an
old
piece
of
gutter
and
ran
who
had
a
wonderful
turn
for
carving
in
carving
a
doll
from
a
piece
of
wood
the
day
before
christmas
the
boys
lost
a
little
time
in
following
and
pitying
a
small
lot
of
prisoners
who
passed
along
the
road
by
the
gate
they
were
always
pitying
the
prisoners
and
planning
means
to
rescue
them
for
they
had
an
idea
that
they
suffered
a
terrible
fate
only
one
certain
case
had
come
to
their
knowledge
a
young
man
had
one
day
been
carried
by
the
holly
hill
gate
on
his
way
to
the
of
the
officer
in
command
of
that
portion
of
the
lines
general
denby
he
was
in
citizen
clothes
which
were
muddy
and
torn
and
he
was
charged
with
being
a
spy
the
guards
with
him
looked
grim
his
face
was
white
and
yet
he
was
a
young
fellow
speaking
scornfully
to
his
guards
bob
and
ran
returned
to
the
house
full
of
excitement
and
spent
some
time
that
night
planning
how
they
might
rescue
him
their
plan
included
no
less
than
the
capture
of
general
denby
himself
bob
mapped
it
all
out
how
he
would
cross
the
creek
dodging
the
picket
at
the
bridge
slip
past
the
sentries
and
walking
into
the
where
the
general
had
his
headquarters
would
seize
him
and
force
him
to
write
a
release
of
the
prisoner
the
next
morning
ran
who
had
risen
early
to
visit
his
rushed
into
his
mother
room
and
oh
mamma
he
gasped
they
have
hung
him
just
because
he
had
on
those
clothes
uncle
saunders
heard
all
about
it
stafford
though
she
was
much
moved
herself
endeavored
to
explain
to
the
boy
that
this
was
one
of
the
laws
of
war
but
ran
mind
was
not
able
to
comprehend
the
principles
which
imposed
so
cruel
a
sentence
for
what
he
deemed
so
harmless
a
fault
it
that
old
general
denby
he
exclaimed
hotly
even
his
own
soldiers
say
he
works
them
to
death
i
wish
somebody
would
capture
him
this
act
and
some
other
measures
of
severity
gave
general
denby
a
reputation
for
much
harshness
among
the
few
old
residents
who
yet
remained
at
their
homes
within
the
lines
and
the
boys
used
to
gaze
at
him
furtively
as
he
would
ride
by
grim
and
stern
followed
by
his
staff
yet
there
were
those
who
said
that
general
denby
rigor
was
simply
the
result
of
a
high
standard
of
duty
and
that
at
bottom
he
had
a
soft
heart
the
children
however
could
never
bear
to
think
of
him
and
when
he
would
pass
along
with
his
staff
as
he
sometimes
did
while
they
were
watching
beside
the
road
and
would
look
at
them
with
something
very
like
a
smile
in
his
eyes
they
would
turn
their
heads
away
for
fear
he
would
speak
to
them
v
the
spy
the
approach
of
christmas
was
marked
even
in
the
federal
camps
and
many
a
song
and
ringing
laugh
were
heard
around
the
glowing
along
the
hills
and
in
the
tents
and
little
cabins
used
as
over
the
boxes
which
were
pouring
in
from
home
the
troops
in
the
camps
near
general
denby
on
christmas
eve
had
been
larking
and
frolicking
all
day
like
so
many
boys
preparing
for
the
festivities
of
the
evening
when
they
proposed
to
have
a
great
entertainment
and
the
general
as
he
sat
in
the
smoky
front
room
in
the
old
used
as
his
writing
official
papers
had
more
than
once
during
the
afternoon
at
the
noise
and
shouting
outside
it
disturbed
him
a
holiday
occasion
was
not
the
easiest
time
for
a
general
in
command
especially
when
the
enemy
lay
in
force
scarcely
five
miles
away
the
men
were
apt
to
think
that
at
such
a
time
discipline
should
be
relaxed
and
they
be
allowed
to
take
it
easy
and
such
an
occasion
was
just
the
moment
when
his
opponent
a
general
as
watchful
as
he
was
able
was
likely
to
make
an
attack
news
had
reached
him
through
his
scouts
that
such
an
attack
was
probable
moreover
the
general
had
been
working
all
day
answering
despatches
from
men
in
washington
telling
him
to
do
things
that
were
either
impossible
or
had
been
done
long
ago
and
to
crown
it
all
the
chimney
smoked
badly
at
length
however
late
in
the
afternoon
he
finished
his
work
and
having
dismissed
his
adjutant
he
locked
the
door
and
pushing
aside
all
his
business
papers
took
from
his
pocket
a
little
letter
and
began
to
read
as
he
read
the
stern
lines
of
the
grim
soldier
face
relaxed
and
more
than
once
a
smile
stole
into
his
eyes
and
stirred
the
corners
of
his
grizzled
mustache
the
letter
was
scrawled
in
a
large
childish
hand
and
many
of
the
words
were
interlined
it
ran
my
dearest
grandpapa
i
want
to
see
you
very
much
i
send
you
a
christmas
gift
i
made
it
all
myself
i
hope
to
get
a
whole
lot
of
dolls
and
other
presents
i
love
you
i
send
you
all
these
kisses
you
must
kiss
them
every
one
do
i
write
well
your
loving
little
granddaughter
lily
when
he
had
finished
reading
the
old
veteran
gravely
lifted
the
letter
to
his
lips
and
pressed
a
kiss
on
each
of
the
little
spaces
so
carefully
drawn
by
the
childish
hand
this
done
he
took
out
his
handkerchief
and
blew
his
nose
violently
as
he
walked
up
and
down
the
room
he
even
muttered
something
about
the
fire
smoking
then
he
sat
down
once
more
at
his
table
and
placing
the
little
letter
before
him
began
to
write
as
he
wrote
the
fire
smoked
more
than
ever
and
the
sounds
of
revelry
outside
reached
him
in
a
perfect
uproar
but
he
no
longer
frowned
and
when
the
strains
of
dixie
came
in
faintly
at
the
window
sung
in
a
clear
rich
mellow
solo
though
for
a
moment
he
looked
surprised
he
sat
back
in
his
chair
and
listened
i
wish
i
were
in
dixie
away
away
in
dixie
land
i
take
my
stand
to
live
and
die
for
dixie
land
away
away
away
down
south
in
dixie
sang
the
voice
full
and
sonorous
when
the
song
ended
there
was
an
outburst
of
applause
and
shouts
apparently
demanding
some
other
song
which
was
refused
for
the
noise
grew
to
a
tumult
the
general
rose
and
walked
to
the
window
a
large
crowd
had
gathered
about
a
campfire
not
far
from
his
window
and
in
the
midst
lifted
up
on
a
box
and
clearly
outlined
against
the
firelight
stood
the
singer
a
tall
straight
man
with
a
long
beard
and
clothes
suddenly
the
uproar
hushed
for
the
voice
began
again
but
this
time
it
was
a
hymn
while
shepherds
watched
their
flocks
by
night
all
seated
on
the
ground
the
angel
of
the
lord
came
down
and
glory
shone
around
verse
after
verse
was
sung
the
men
pouring
out
of
their
tents
and
huts
to
listen
to
the
music
all
glory
be
to
god
on
high
and
to
the
earth
be
peace
good
will
henceforth
from
heaven
to
men
begin
and
never
cease
begin
and
never
cease
sang
the
singer
to
the
end
when
the
strain
died
away
there
was
dead
silence
for
a
little
space
and
then
the
talk
began
on
a
lower
key
the
general
stood
for
a
moment
then
turned
from
the
window
finished
his
letter
and
sealed
it
carefully
folding
up
the
little
sheet
which
lay
before
him
he
replaced
it
in
his
pocket
and
going
to
the
door
summoned
the
orderly
who
was
just
without
mail
that
at
once
he
said
yes
sir
the
soldier
saluted
and
turned
to
leave
by
the
way
who
was
that
singing
out
there
just
now
i
mean
that
last
one
who
sang
and
the
hymn
only
a
pedler
sir
i
believe
the
general
eyes
fixed
themselves
on
the
soldier
where
did
he
come
from
i
do
know
sir
some
of
the
boys
had
him
singing
tell
major
dayle
to
come
here
immediately
said
the
general
in
a
moment
the
officer
summoned
entered
a
stout
man
who
looked
as
if
he
took
the
world
easy
he
appeared
somewhat
embarrassed
who
was
this
pedler
asked
the
commander
i
i
do
know
began
the
other
you
do
know
where
did
he
come
from
from
colonel
watchley
camp
directly
said
he
relieved
to
shift
a
part
of
the
responsibility
how
was
he
dressed
in
citizen
clothes
what
did
he
have
a
pack
a
few
toys
and
trinkets
and
books
what
was
his
name
i
did
not
hear
it
and
you
let
him
go
the
general
eyes
snapped
yes
sir
i
do
think
he
began
no
i
know
you
do
said
the
general
have
i
not
given
strict
orders
he
was
a
spy
where
has
he
gone
i
i
do
know
he
can
not
have
gone
far
report
yourself
under
arrest
said
the
commander
sternly
the
officer
after
waiting
a
moment
walked
off
scowling
walking
to
the
door
the
general
said
to
the
sentinel
call
the
corporal
and
tell
him
to
request
captain
albert
to
come
here
immediately
in
a
moment
an
alert
young
officer
came
up
and
the
general
gave
him
an
order
he
must
be
found
and
not
allowed
to
escape
he
said
in
closing
yes
sir
i
find
him
he
said
as
he
hurried
off
ten
minutes
later
a
small
body
of
horsemen
rode
rapidly
out
of
camp
in
the
direction
the
pedler
had
taken
the
picket
at
the
bridge
across
the
little
stream
below
the
camp
had
seen
nothing
of
the
pedler
and
the
men
separated
and
began
to
visit
the
camps
stretched
along
the
slopes
above
the
stream
an
hour
or
two
later
captain
albert
reported
that
he
had
traced
the
spy
to
a
place
just
over
the
creek
where
he
was
believed
to
be
harbored
he
wanted
more
men
to
surround
the
house
take
a
detail
and
arrest
him
or
burn
the
house
ordered
the
general
angrily
it
is
a
perfect
nest
of
treason
even
the
slaves
are
rebels
he
said
to
himself
as
he
walked
up
and
down
as
though
in
justification
of
his
savage
order
he
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
it
struck
a
little
square
envelope
or
wait
he
called
to
the
captain
who
was
just
withdrawing
i
will
go
there
myself
and
take
it
for
my
it
is
a
better
place
than
this
i
can
not
stand
this
smoke
any
longer
that
will
break
up
their
treasonable
work
vi
santa
claus
passes
the
lines
all
that
day
the
tongues
of
the
two
little
ones
at
holly
hill
had
been
chattering
unceasingly
of
the
expected
visit
of
santa
claus
that
night
stafford
had
tried
to
explain
to
charlie
and
evelyn
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
santa
claus
to
bring
them
their
presents
this
year
but
she
was
met
with
the
undeniable
and
unanswerable
statement
that
their
father
had
promised
them
before
going
to
bed
they
had
hung
their
stockings
on
the
mantelpiece
right
in
front
of
the
chimney
so
that
santa
claus
would
be
sure
to
see
them
the
mother
had
broken
down
over
evelyn
prayer
not
to
forget
my
papa
and
not
to
forget
my
dolly
and
to
take
care
of
my
papa
and
of
santa
claus
and
not
to
let
the
yankees
hurt
and
her
tears
fell
silently
after
the
little
ones
were
asleep
as
she
put
the
finishing
touches
to
the
tiny
gray
uniform
for
charlie
she
was
thinking
not
only
of
the
children
disappointment
but
of
the
absence
of
him
on
whose
promise
they
had
so
securely
relied
he
had
been
away
now
for
a
year
and
she
had
had
no
word
of
him
for
many
weeks
where
was
he
was
he
dead
or
alive
stafford
sank
on
her
knees
by
the
bedside
o
god
give
me
faith
like
this
little
child
she
prayed
again
and
again
she
was
startled
by
hearing
a
step
on
the
front
portico
and
a
knock
at
the
door
bob
who
was
working
in
front
of
the
went
to
the
door
his
mother
heard
him
answer
doubtfully
some
question
she
opened
the
door
of
her
chamber
and
went
out
into
the
hall
a
stranger
with
a
large
bundle
or
pack
on
his
back
stood
on
the
threshold
his
clothes
were
shabby
and
old
his
hat
which
was
still
on
his
head
was
pulled
down
over
his
eyes
and
he
wore
a
beard
an
leddy
wud
ye
bay
so
koind
as
to
shelter
a
poor
sthranger
for
a
noight
at
this
blissed
time
of
pace
and
he
said
in
a
strong
irish
brogue
certainly
said
stafford
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
him
she
moved
slowly
up
to
him
then
by
an
instinct
quickly
lifting
her
hand
she
pushed
his
hat
back
from
his
eyes
her
husband
clasped
her
in
his
arms
my
darling
bob
with
a
cry
seized
him
i
knew
you
come
father
he
said
they
all
said
you
would
declared
stafford
well
i
to
come
i
had
given
my
word
said
colonel
stafford
smiling
the
colonel
was
borne
into
the
hall
a
little
later
the
pack
was
opened
and
such
a
of
toys
and
things
was
displayed
as
surely
never
greeted
any
other
eyes
the
smaller
children
including
ran
were
not
awakened
at
their
request
though
stafford
wished
to
wake
them
to
see
him
but
bob
was
let
into
the
secrets
except
that
he
was
not
permitted
to
see
a
small
package
which
bore
his
name
stafford
and
the
colonel
were
like
two
children
themselves
as
they
tipped
about
stuffing
the
long
stockings
with
candy
and
toys
the
beautiful
doll
with
flaxen
hair
all
arrayed
in
silk
and
lace
was
seated
last
of
all
securely
on
top
of
evelyn
stocking
with
her
wardrobe
just
below
her
where
she
would
greet
her
young
mistress
when
she
should
first
open
her
eyes
and
charlie
little
blue
uniform
was
pinned
beside
the
gray
one
his
mother
had
made
with
his
sword
buckled
around
the
waist
bob
was
at
last
dismissed
to
his
room
and
the
colonel
and
stafford
settled
themselves
before
the
fire
hand
in
hand
to
talk
over
the
past
they
had
hardly
started
when
bob
rushed
down
the
stairs
and
dashed
into
their
room
papa
papa
the
yard
is
full
of
yankees
both
the
colonel
and
stafford
sprang
to
their
feet
through
the
back
door
cried
stafford
seizing
her
husband
he
can
not
get
out
that
way
they
are
everywhere
all
around
the
house
i
saw
them
from
my
window
gasped
bob
just
as
the
sound
of
trampling
without
came
to
their
ears
oh
what
will
you
do
those
clothes
if
they
catch
you
in
those
clothes
began
stafford
and
then
stopped
her
face
growing
ashy
pale
bob
also
turned
even
whiter
than
he
had
been
before
he
remembered
the
fate
of
the
young
man
who
was
found
in
citizen
clothes
in
the
autumn
he
burst
out
crying
oh
papa
will
they
hang
you
he
sobbed
i
hope
not
my
son
said
the
colonel
certainly
not
if
i
can
prevent
it
a
gleam
of
humor
stole
into
his
eyes
it
an
awkward
fix
certainly
he
added
gravely
a
number
of
footsteps
sounded
on
the
porch
and
a
thundering
knock
shook
the
door
you
must
conceal
yourself
cried
stafford
come
here
she
pulled
him
almost
by
main
force
into
a
closet
or
entry
and
locked
the
door
just
as
the
knocking
was
renewed
as
the
front
door
was
apparently
about
to
be
broken
down
she
went
out
into
the
hall
her
face
was
deadly
white
and
her
lips
were
moving
in
prayer
who
there
she
called
tremblingly
trying
to
gain
time
open
the
door
immediately
or
it
will
be
broken
down
replied
a
stern
voice
she
turned
the
great
iron
key
in
the
heavy
old
brass
lock
and
a
dozen
men
pushed
into
the
hall
they
all
waited
for
one
a
tall
elderly
man
in
a
general
with
a
stern
face
and
a
grizzled
beard
he
addressed
her
madam
i
have
come
to
take
possession
of
this
house
as
my
stafford
bowed
unable
to
speak
she
was
sensible
of
a
feeling
of
relief
there
was
a
gleam
of
hope
if
they
did
not
know
of
her
husband
presence
but
the
next
word
destroyed
it
we
have
not
interfered
with
you
up
to
the
present
time
but
you
have
been
harboring
a
spy
here
and
he
is
here
now
there
is
no
spy
here
and
has
never
been
said
stafford
with
dignity
but
if
there
were
you
should
not
know
it
from
me
it
is
not
the
custom
of
our
people
to
deliver
up
those
who
have
sought
their
protection
she
spoke
with
much
spirit
the
officer
removed
his
hat
his
keen
eye
was
fixed
on
her
white
face
we
shall
search
the
premises
he
said
still
sternly
but
more
respectfully
than
he
had
yet
spoken
major
have
the
house
thoroughly
searched
the
men
went
striding
off
opening
doors
and
looking
through
the
rooms
the
general
took
a
turn
up
and
down
the
hall
he
walked
up
to
a
door
that
is
my
chamber
said
stafford
quickly
the
officer
fell
back
it
must
be
searched
he
said
my
little
children
are
asleep
in
there
said
stafford
her
face
quite
white
it
must
be
searched
repeated
the
general
more
gently
either
they
must
do
it
or
i
you
can
take
your
choice
stafford
stood
aside
and
made
a
gesture
of
assent
she
could
not
trust
her
voice
he
opened
the
door
and
stepped
across
the
threshold
there
he
stopped
his
eye
took
in
the
scene
charlie
was
lying
in
the
little
in
the
corner
calm
and
peaceful
and
by
his
side
was
evelyn
her
little
face
looking
like
a
flower
lying
in
the
tangle
of
golden
hair
which
fell
over
her
pillow
the
noise
disturbed
her
slightly
for
she
smiled
suddenly
and
muttered
something
about
santa
tlaus
and
a
dolly
the
officer
gaze
swept
the
room
and
fell
on
the
overcrowded
stockings
hanging
from
the
mantel
he
advanced
to
the
fireplace
and
examined
the
doll
and
trousers
closely
with
a
curious
expression
on
his
face
he
leant
over
and
gazed
earnestly
down
at
the
two
little
heads
on
their
pillow
then
he
turned
and
walked
out
of
the
room
closing
the
door
softly
behind
him
major
he
said
to
the
officer
in
charge
of
the
searching
party
who
descended
the
stairs
just
then
take
the
men
back
to
camp
except
the
sentinels
there
is
no
spy
here
in
a
moment
stafford
came
out
of
her
chamber
the
old
officer
was
walking
up
and
down
in
deep
thought
suddenly
as
the
last
soldier
disappeared
through
the
door
he
turned
to
her
stafford
be
so
kind
as
to
go
and
tell
colonel
stafford
that
general
denby
desires
him
to
surrender
himself
stafford
was
struck
dumb
she
was
unable
to
move
or
to
speak
kindly
present
my
compliments
and
say
he
need
not
hurry
i
shall
wait
for
him
said
the
general
quietly
throwing
himself
into
an
and
looking
steadily
into
the
fire
vii
bob
secures
a
uniform
as
his
father
concealed
himself
bob
had
left
the
chamber
he
was
in
a
perfect
agony
of
mind
he
knew
that
his
father
could
not
escape
and
if
he
were
found
dressed
in
citizen
clothes
he
felt
that
he
could
have
but
one
fate
once
the
men
went
toward
the
passage
that
led
through
to
the
rear
entry
in
which
his
father
was
concealed
heart
stood
still
but
he
acted
quickly
he
flung
himself
on
the
floor
right
in
the
entrance
and
began
to
work
quietly
by
the
dim
firelight
the
searchers
passed
by
all
sorts
of
schemes
for
rescue
entered
his
head
suddenly
he
thought
of
a
small
group
of
prisoners
he
had
seen
pass
by
about
dark
he
had
talked
with
one
of
them
a
major
a
guard
said
they
were
on
their
way
to
general
denby
camp
he
would
save
him
putting
on
his
hat
he
opened
the
front
door
and
slipped
out
a
sentinel
tramping
up
and
down
on
the
porch
accosted
him
surlily
to
know
where
he
was
going
wo
you
come
in
and
get
warm
said
bob
hospitably
ca
wish
i
could
it
cold
enough
out
here
cold
as
th
state
of
maine
i
wish
i
was
in
old
york
right
now
by
a
good
stove
i
wish
you
were
too
said
bob
with
sincerity
i
give
a
mite
to
see
that
old
white
steeple
again
and
the
moonlight
on
the
snow
stretching
down
toward
the
and
hear
the
tide
ripping
in
what
do
you
do
with
your
prisoners
when
you
catch
them
inquired
bob
send
some
on
to
prison
and
hang
some
i
mean
when
you
first
catch
them
oh
they
stay
in
camp
we
do
treat
bad
without
they
be
spies
there
a
batch
at
camp
now
got
in
this
evening
sort
the
soldier
laughed
as
he
stamped
his
feet
to
keep
warm
where
your
camp
bob
asked
about
a
mile
from
here
right
on
the
road
or
rather
right
on
the
hill
at
the
edge
o
the
pines
the
crick
the
boy
left
him
and
sauntered
in
and
out
among
the
other
men
who
were
building
a
fire
in
the
yard
presently
he
moved
on
to
the
edge
of
the
lawn
beyond
them
no
one
took
further
notice
of
him
in
a
second
he
had
slipped
through
the
gate
and
was
flying
across
the
field
he
knew
every
foot
of
the
ground
as
well
as
a
hare
for
he
had
been
hunting
and
setting
traps
over
it
since
he
was
as
big
as
little
charlie
he
had
to
make
a
detour
at
the
creek
to
avoid
the
picket
at
the
bridge
and
the
dense
briers
in
the
bottom
were
very
bad
and
painful
however
he
worked
his
way
through
though
his
face
and
hands
were
severely
scratched
into
the
creek
he
plunged
outch
he
had
stepped
into
a
hole
up
to
his
waist
and
the
water
was
as
cold
as
ice
however
he
was
soon
through
and
at
the
top
of
the
hill
he
could
see
the
glow
of
the
lighting
up
the
sky
he
crept
up
cautiously
and
saw
the
dark
forms
of
the
sentinels
pacing
backward
and
forward
wrapped
in
their
overcoats
now
lit
up
by
the
fire
then
growing
black
against
its
blazing
embers
then
lit
up
again
and
passing
away
into
the
shadow
how
could
he
ever
get
by
them
his
heart
began
to
beat
and
his
teeth
to
chatter
but
he
walked
boldly
up
halt
who
goes
there
cried
the
sentry
bringing
his
gun
down
and
advancing
on
him
bob
kept
on
and
the
sentinel
finding
that
it
was
only
a
boy
looked
rather
sheepish
to
the
men
about
the
his
appearance
was
the
signal
for
fun
do
let
him
capture
you
jim
called
one
of
them
call
the
corporal
of
the
guard
another
order
up
the
reserves
a
third
he
a
for
you
i
going
to
put
him
in
your
stocking
laughed
one
it
big
enough
to
hold
him
said
another
bob
had
to
undergo
something
of
an
examination
where
had
he
come
from
i
know
the
little
johnny
said
one
of
the
men
he
lives
over
in
the
white
house
on
the
hill
to
that
side
of
the
creek
they
told
bob
to
draw
up
to
the
fire
and
made
quite
a
fuss
over
him
bob
had
his
wits
about
him
and
soon
learned
that
a
batch
of
prisoners
were
at
a
fire
a
hundred
yards
farther
back
he
therefore
made
his
way
over
there
although
he
was
advised
to
stay
where
he
was
and
get
dry
and
had
many
offers
of
a
bunk
from
his
new
friends
some
of
whom
followed
him
over
to
where
the
prisoners
were
most
of
the
prisoners
were
quartered
for
the
night
in
a
hut
before
which
a
guard
was
stationed
one
or
two
however
sat
around
the
chatting
with
their
guards
among
these
was
a
major
in
full
uniform
bob
singled
him
out
he
was
just
about
his
father
size
bob
was
instantly
the
centre
of
attraction
again
he
told
them
he
was
from
holly
hill
again
he
was
recognized
by
one
of
the
men
run
away
to
join
the
army
asked
one
no
said
bob
his
eyes
flashing
at
the
suggestion
lost
no
mother
whipped
you
no
as
soon
as
their
curiosity
had
somewhat
subsided
bob
who
had
hardly
been
able
to
contain
himself
said
to
the
confederate
major
in
a
low
undertone
my
father
colonel
stafford
is
at
home
concealed
and
the
yankees
have
taken
possession
of
the
house
well
said
the
major
looking
down
at
him
as
if
casually
he
can
not
escape
he
came
through
the
lines
and
he
has
on
citizen
clothes
and
bob
voice
choked
suddenly
as
he
gazed
at
the
major
uniform
well
the
prisoner
for
a
second
looked
sharply
down
at
the
earnest
face
then
he
put
his
hand
under
his
chin
and
lifting
it
looked
into
his
eyes
bob
shivered
and
a
sob
escaped
him
the
major
placed
his
hand
firmly
on
his
knee
why
you
are
wringing
wet
he
said
aloud
i
wonder
you
are
not
frozen
to
death
he
rose
and
stripped
off
his
coat
here
get
into
this
and
before
the
boy
knew
it
the
major
had
bundled
him
into
his
coat
and
rolled
up
the
sleeves
so
that
bob
could
use
his
hands
the
action
attracted
the
attention
of
the
rest
of
the
group
and
several
of
the
soldiers
offered
to
take
the
boy
and
give
him
dry
clothes
no
sir
laughed
the
major
this
boy
is
a
rebel
do
you
think
he
will
wear
one
of
your
yankee
suits
he
a
little
major
and
i
going
to
give
him
a
major
uniform
in
a
minute
he
had
stripped
off
his
trousers
and
was
helping
bob
into
them
standing
himself
in
his
underclothes
in
the
icy
air
the
legs
were
twice
too
long
for
the
boy
and
the
waist
came
up
to
his
now
go
home
to
your
mother
said
the
major
laughing
at
his
appearance
and
some
of
you
fellows
get
me
some
clothes
or
a
blanket
i
wear
your
yankee
uniform
out
of
sheer
necessity
bob
trotted
around
keeping
as
far
away
from
the
light
of
the
as
possible
he
soon
found
himself
unobserved
and
reaching
the
shadow
of
a
line
of
huts
and
keeping
well
in
it
he
came
to
the
edge
of
the
camp
he
watched
his
opportunity
and
when
the
back
was
turned
he
slipped
out
into
the
darkness
in
an
instant
he
was
flying
down
the
hill
the
heavy
clothes
impeded
him
and
he
stopped
only
long
enough
to
snatch
them
off
and
roll
them
into
a
bundle
and
sped
on
his
way
again
he
struck
the
main
road
and
was
running
down
it
as
fast
as
his
legs
could
carry
him
when
he
suddenly
found
himself
almost
on
a
group
of
dark
objects
who
were
standing
in
the
road
just
in
front
of
him
one
of
them
moved
it
was
the
picket
he
had
forgotten
all
about
them
bob
suddenly
stopped
his
heart
was
in
his
throat
illustration
bob
trotted
around
keeping
as
far
away
from
the
light
of
the
as
possible
who
goes
there
said
a
stern
voice
bob
heart
beat
as
if
it
would
spring
out
of
his
body
come
in
we
have
you
said
the
man
advancing
bob
sprang
across
the
ditch
beside
the
road
and
putting
his
hand
on
the
top
rail
of
the
low
fence
flung
himself
over
it
bundle
and
all
flat
on
the
other
side
just
as
a
blaze
of
light
burst
from
the
picket
and
the
report
of
a
carbine
startled
the
silent
night
the
bullet
grazed
the
boy
arm
and
crashed
through
the
rail
in
a
second
bob
was
on
his
feet
the
picket
was
almost
on
him
seizing
his
bundle
he
dived
into
the
thicket
as
a
shots
were
sent
ringing
after
him
the
bullets
hissing
and
whistling
over
his
head
several
men
dashed
into
the
woods
after
him
in
hot
pursuit
and
a
couple
more
galloped
up
the
road
to
intercept
him
but
bob
feet
were
winged
and
he
slipped
through
briers
and
brush
like
a
scared
hare
they
scratched
his
face
and
threw
him
down
but
he
was
up
again
now
and
then
a
shot
crashed
behind
him
but
he
did
not
care
for
that
he
thought
only
of
being
caught
a
few
hundred
yards
up
the
stream
he
plunged
into
the
water
and
wading
across
was
soon
safe
from
his
pursuers
breathless
he
climbed
the
hill
made
his
way
through
the
woods
and
emerged
into
the
open
fields
across
these
he
sped
like
a
deer
he
had
almost
given
out
what
if
they
should
have
caught
his
father
and
he
should
be
too
late
a
sob
escaped
him
at
the
bare
thought
and
he
broke
again
into
a
fast
run
wiping
off
with
his
sleeve
the
tears
that
would
come
the
wind
cut
him
like
a
knife
but
he
did
not
mind
that
as
he
neared
the
house
he
feared
that
he
might
be
stopped
again
and
the
clothes
taken
from
him
so
he
paused
for
a
moment
and
slipped
them
on
once
more
rolling
up
the
sleeves
and
legs
as
well
as
he
could
he
crossed
the
yard
undisturbed
he
went
around
to
the
same
door
by
which
he
had
come
out
for
he
thought
this
his
best
chance
the
same
sentinel
was
there
walking
up
and
down
blowing
his
cold
hands
had
his
father
been
arrested
bob
teeth
chattered
but
it
was
with
suppressed
excitement
your
clothes
seem
to
grown
a
mite
since
you
went
out
said
the
sentry
quizzically
yes
i
was
stammered
bob
is
pretty
cold
said
the
sentry
ye
es
gasped
bob
your
mother
been
out
here
looking
for
you
i
guess
said
the
soldier
with
much
friendliness
i
rec
reckon
so
panted
bob
moving
toward
the
door
did
that
mean
that
his
father
was
caught
he
opened
the
door
and
slipped
quietly
into
the
corridor
general
denby
still
sat
silent
before
the
bob
listened
at
the
his
mother
was
weeping
his
father
stood
calm
and
resolute
before
the
fire
he
had
determined
to
give
himself
up
if
you
only
did
not
have
on
those
clothes
sobbed
stafford
if
i
only
had
not
cut
up
the
old
uniform
for
the
children
mother
mother
i
have
one
gasped
bob
bursting
into
the
room
and
tearing
off
the
unknown
major
uniform
viii
santa
claus
surrenders
ten
minutes
later
colonel
stafford
with
a
steady
step
and
a
proud
carriage
and
with
his
hand
resting
on
bob
shoulder
walked
out
into
the
hall
he
was
dressed
in
the
uniform
of
a
confederate
major
which
fitted
admirably
his
tall
erect
figure
general
denby
i
believe
he
said
as
the
union
officer
rose
and
faced
him
we
have
met
before
under
somewhat
different
circumstances
he
said
with
a
bow
for
i
now
find
myself
your
prisoner
i
have
the
honor
to
request
your
parole
said
the
general
with
great
politeness
and
to
express
the
hope
that
i
may
be
able
in
some
way
to
return
the
courtesy
which
i
formerly
received
at
your
hands
he
extended
his
hand
and
colonel
stafford
took
it
you
have
my
parole
said
he
i
was
not
aware
said
the
general
with
a
bow
toward
stafford
until
i
entered
the
room
where
your
children
were
sleeping
that
i
had
the
honor
of
your
husband
acquaintance
i
will
now
take
my
leave
and
return
to
my
camp
that
i
may
not
by
my
presence
interfere
with
the
joy
of
this
season
i
desire
to
introduce
to
you
my
son
said
colonel
stafford
proudly
presenting
bob
he
is
a
hero
the
general
bowed
as
he
shook
hands
with
him
perhaps
he
had
some
suspicion
how
true
a
hero
he
was
for
he
rested
his
hand
kindly
on
the
boy
head
but
said
nothing
both
colonel
and
stafford
invited
the
old
soldier
to
spend
the
night
there
but
he
declined
he
however
accepted
an
invitation
to
dine
with
them
next
day
before
leaving
he
requested
permission
to
take
one
more
look
at
the
sleeping
children
over
evelyn
he
bent
silently
suddenly
stooping
he
kissed
her
little
pink
cheek
and
with
a
scarcely
audible
passed
quickly
out
of
the
room
and
left
the
house
the
next
morning
by
light
there
was
great
rejoicing
charlie
and
evelyn
were
up
betimes
and
were
laughing
and
chattering
over
their
presents
like
two
little
magpies
those
yankees
did
not
catch
santa
claus
at
all
here
my
sword
and
here
my
breeches
cried
charlie
two
pair
but
i
goin
to
put
on
my
gray
ones
i
ai
goin
to
wear
a
blue
uniform
here
my
dolly
screamed
evelyn
in
an
ecstasy
over
her
beautiful
present
just
then
their
father
sat
up
and
spoke
to
them
with
a
cry
they
gathered
up
their
presents
and
made
a
dash
for
him
just
see
what
santa
claus
brought
us
they
cried
hugging
him
warmly
how
did
you
tum
asked
evelyn
in
a
pause
oh
do
you
know
santa
claus
brought
him
to
mamma
said
charlie
arrogantly
papa
did
he
let
you
drive
the
reindeer
presently
bob
and
ran
burst
in
their
eyes
fairly
dancing
it
a
real
one
real
gold
cried
bob
holding
up
a
small
gold
watch
while
ran
was
shouting
over
a
silver
watch
of
the
same
size
that
evening
after
dinner
general
denby
was
sitting
by
the
fire
in
the
holly
hill
parlor
with
evelyn
nestled
in
his
lap
her
dolly
clasped
close
to
her
bosom
and
in
the
absence
of
colonel
stafford
who
had
walked
out
with
the
older
boys
the
general
told
stafford
the
story
of
the
opening
of
the
package
by
the
the
tears
welled
up
in
stafford
eyes
and
ran
down
her
cheeks
charlie
suddenly
entered
in
all
the
majesty
of
his
new
breeches
and
sword
buckled
on
hip
he
saw
his
mother
tears
his
little
face
flushed
in
a
second
his
sword
was
out
and
he
struck
a
hostile
attitude
you
make
my
mamma
cry
he
shouted
charlie
charlie
cried
stafford
hastening
to
stop
him
my
papa
said
i
was
not
to
let
anyone
make
you
cry
insisted
the
boy
stepping
before
his
mother
and
still
keeping
his
angry
eyes
on
the
general
oh
charlie
stafford
took
hold
of
him
i
am
ashamed
of
you
to
be
so
rude
let
him
alone
madam
said
the
general
it
is
not
rudeness
it
is
spirit
the
spirit
of
our
race
he
has
the
soldier
blood
and
some
day
he
will
be
a
soldier
himself
and
a
brave
one
i
shall
count
on
him
for
the
union
he
said
with
a
smile
stafford
shook
her
head
but
the
general
nodded
again
and
drawing
the
little
boy
to
his
knees
told
him
of
his
father
showing
him
the
sword
by
the
when
he
himself
was
a
prisoner
a
few
days
later
colonel
stafford
in
accordance
with
an
understanding
went
over
to
general
denby
camp
and
reported
to
be
sent
on
to
washington
as
a
prisoner
of
war
the
general
was
absent
on
the
lines
at
the
time
but
was
expected
soon
and
the
colonel
waited
for
him
at
his
there
had
been
many
tears
shed
when
his
wife
bade
him
about
an
hour
after
the
colonel
left
home
the
general
and
his
staff
were
riding
back
to
camp
along
the
road
which
ran
by
the
holly
hill
gate
just
before
they
reached
it
two
little
figures
came
out
of
the
gate
and
started
down
the
road
one
was
a
boy
of
five
who
carried
a
toy
sword
drawn
in
one
hand
whilst
with
the
other
he
led
his
companion
a
little
girl
of
three
who
clasped
a
large
doll
to
her
breast
the
soldiers
cantered
forward
and
overtook
them
the
little
girl
shrank
behind
her
brother
where
he
stood
stoutly
holding
her
behind
him
with
one
hand
while
with
the
other
he
clutched
his
small
sword
defiantly
where
are
you
going
my
little
people
inquired
the
general
reining
in
and
gazing
down
at
them
affectionately
i
goin
to
get
my
papa
said
the
tiny
swordsman
firmly
turning
a
sturdy
and
determined
little
face
up
to
him
my
mamma
cryin
i
goin
to
take
my
papa
home
i
ain
goin
to
let
the
yankees
have
him
illustration
i
goin
to
get
my
papa
said
the
tiny
swordsman
the
officers
all
broke
into
a
murmur
of
mingled
admiration
and
amusement
no
we
ain
goin
let
the
yankees
have
our
papa
chimed
in
evelyn
pushing
her
tangled
hair
out
of
her
eyes
and
keeping
fast
hold
of
charlie
hand
for
fear
of
the
horses
around
her
the
general
dismounted
how
are
you
going
to
help
my
little
semiramis
he
asked
stooping
over
her
with
smiling
eyes
i
goin
to
give
my
dolly
if
they
will
give
me
my
papa
she
said
gravely
as
if
she
understood
the
equality
of
the
exchange
suppose
you
give
a
kiss
instead
there
was
a
second
of
hesitation
and
then
she
put
up
her
little
face
and
the
old
general
dropped
on
one
knee
in
the
road
and
lifted
her
in
his
arms
doll
and
all
gentlemen
he
said
to
his
staff
you
behold
the
future
defenders
of
the
union
the
little
ones
were
coaxed
home
charlie
in
front
of
a
and
evelyn
in
front
of
general
denby
himself
and
that
afternoon
as
colonel
stafford
was
expecting
to
leave
the
camp
for
washington
with
a
lot
of
prisoners
a
despatch
was
brought
in
to
general
denby
who
smiled
as
he
read
it
colonel
he
said
addressing
him
i
think
i
shall
have
to
continue
your
parole
a
few
days
longer
i
have
just
received
information
that
by
a
special
cartel
which
i
have
arranged

are
to
be
exchanged
for
colonel
mcdowell
as
soon
as
he
can
reach
the
lines
at
this
point
from
richmond
and
meantime
as
we
have
but
indifferent
accommodations
here
i
shall
have
to
request
you
to
consider
holly
hill
as
your
place
of
confinement
will
you
be
so
kind
as
to
convey
my
respects
to
stafford
and
to
your
young
hero
bob
and
make
good
my
word
to
those
two
little
commissioners
of
exchange
to
whom
i
feel
somewhat
committed
he
held
out
his
hand
i
wish
you
a
merry
christmas
and
a
happy
new
year
