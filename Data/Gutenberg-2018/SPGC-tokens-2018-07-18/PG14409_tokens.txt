published
in
by
henry
holt
and
company
the
new
church
of
john
on
fifth
avenue
was
thronged
the
morning
of
the
last
sunday
of
october
in
the
year
sitting
in
the
gallery
beneath
the
unfinished
frescoes
and
looking
down
the
nave
one
caught
an
effect
of
autumn
gardens
a
suggestion
of
chrysanthemums
and
geraniums
or
of
october
woods
dashed
with
scarlet
oaks
and
yellow
maples
as
a
display
of
austerity
the
show
was
a
failure
but
if
cheerful
content
and
innocent
adornment
please
the
author
of
the
lilies
and
roses
there
was
reason
to
hope
that
this
first
service
at
john
found
favor
in
his
sight
even
though
it
showed
no
victory
over
the
world
or
the
flesh
in
this
part
of
the
united
states
the
sun
came
in
through
the
figure
of
john
in
his
crimson
and
green
garments
of
glass
and
scattered
more
color
where
colors
already
rivaled
the
flowers
of
a
prize
show
while
huge
prophets
and
evangelists
in
flowing
robes
looked
down
from
the
red
walls
on
a
display
of
human
vanities
that
would
have
called
out
a
vehement
lamentation
of
jeremiah
or
song
of
solomon
had
these
poets
been
present
in
flesh
as
they
were
in
figure
solomon
was
a
brilliant
but
not
an
accurate
observer
he
looked
at
the
world
from
the
narrow
of
his
own
temple
here
in
new
york
he
could
not
have
truthfully
said
that
all
was
vanity
for
even
a
more
satirist
than
he
must
have
confessed
that
there
was
in
this
new
temple
a
perceptible
interest
in
religion
one
might
almost
have
said
that
religion
seemed
to
be
a
matter
of
concern
the
audience
wore
a
look
of
interest
and
even
after
their
first
gaze
of
admiration
and
whispered
criticism
at
the
splendors
of
their
new
church
when
at
length
the
clergyman
entered
to
begin
the
service
a
ripple
of
excitement
swept
across
the
field
of
bonnets
until
there
was
almost
a
murmur
as
of
rustling
cornfields
within
the
many
colored
walls
of
john
in
a
remote
pew
hidden
under
a
gallery
of
the
transept
two
persons
looked
on
with
especial
interest
the
number
of
strangers
who
crowded
in
after
them
forced
them
to
sit
closely
together
and
their
low
whispers
of
comment
were
unheard
by
their
neighbors
before
the
service
began
they
talked
in
a
secular
tone
wharton
window
is
too
said
the
man
you
all
said
it
would
be
like
aladdin
murmured
the
woman
yes
but
he
throws
away
his
jewels
rejoined
the
man
see
the
big
prophet
over
the
arch
he
looks
as
though
he
wanted
to
come
down
and
i
think
he
ought
did
michael
angelo
ever
take
lessons
of
mr
wharton
asked
the
woman
seriously
looking
up
at
the
figures
high
above
the
pulpit
he
was
only
a
prophet
answered
her
companion
and
looking
in
another
direction
next
asked
who
is
the
angel
of
paradise
in
the
wings
sliding
up
the
main
aisle
that
o
you
know
her
it
is
miss
leonard
she
is
lovely
but
she
is
only
an
angel
of
paris
i
never
saw
her
before
in
my
life
he
replied
but
i
know
her
bonnet
was
put
on
in
the
lord
honor
for
the
first
time
this
morning
women
should
take
their
bonnets
off
at
the
church
door
as
mussulmen
do
their
shoes
she
answered
do
turn
mahommedan
esther
to
be
a
puritan
is
bad
enough
the
bonnets
match
the
decorations
pity
the
transepts
are
not
finished
she
continued
gazing
up
at
the
bare
scaffolding
opposite
you
are
lucky
to
have
any
thing
finished
he
rejoined
since
hazard
got
here
every
thing
is
turned
upside
down
all
the
plans
are
changed
he
and
wharton
have
taken
the
bit
in
their
teeth
and
the
church
committee
have
got
to
pay
for
whatever
damage
is
done
has
mr
hazard
voice
enough
to
fill
the
church
she
asked
watch
him
and
see
how
well
he
do
it
here
he
comes
and
he
will
hit
the
right
pitch
on
his
first
word
the
organ
stopped
the
clergyman
appeared
and
the
talkers
were
silent
until
the
litany
ended
and
the
organ
began
again
under
the
prolonged
rustle
of
settling
for
the
sermon
more
whispers
passed
he
is
all
eyes
murmured
esther
and
it
was
true
that
at
this
distance
the
preacher
seemed
to
be
made
up
of
two
eyes
and
a
voice
so
slight
and
delicate
was
his
frame
very
tall
slender
and
dark
his
thin
long
face
gave
so
spiritual
an
expression
to
his
figure
that
the
great
eyes
seemed
to
penetrate
like
his
clear
voice
to
every
soul
within
their
range
good
art
muttered
her
companion
we
are
too
much
behind
the
scenes
replied
she
it
is
a
stage
like
any
other
he
rejoined
there
should
be
an
and
wharton
could
design
one
with
a
last
judgment
he
would
put
us
into
it
george
and
we
should
be
among
the
wicked
i
am
a
martyr
answered
george
shortly
the
clergyman
now
mounted
his
pulpit
and
after
a
moment
pause
said
in
his
quietest
manner
and
clearest
voice
he
that
hath
ears
to
hear
let
him
hear
an
almost
imperceptible
shiver
passed
through
esther
figure
wait
he
will
slip
in
the
humility
later
muttered
george
on
the
contrary
the
young
preacher
seemed
bent
on
letting
no
trace
of
humility
slip
into
his
first
sermon
nothing
could
be
simpler
than
his
manner
which
if
it
had
a
fault
sinned
rather
on
the
side
of
plainness
and
monotony
than
of
rhetoric
but
he
spoke
with
the
air
of
one
who
had
a
message
to
deliver
which
he
was
more
anxious
to
give
as
he
received
than
to
add
any
thing
of
his
own
he
meant
to
repeat
it
all
without
an
attempt
to
soften
it
he
took
possession
of
his
flock
with
a
general
advertisement
that
he
owned
every
sheep
in
it
white
or
black
and
to
show
that
there
could
be
no
doubt
on
the
matter
he
added
a
general
claim
to
right
of
property
in
all
mankind
and
the
universe
he
did
this
in
the
name
and
on
behalf
of
the
church
universal
but
there
was
in
the
quiet
air
with
which
he
pointed
out
the
nature
of
his
title
and
then
after
sweeping
all
human
thought
and
will
into
his
shut
down
the
lid
with
a
sharp
click
and
bade
his
audience
kneel
the
sermon
dealt
with
the
relations
of
religion
to
society
it
began
by
claiming
that
all
being
and
all
thought
rose
by
slow
gradations
to
god
ended
in
him
for
him
existed
only
through
him
and
because
of
being
his
the
form
of
act
or
thought
mattered
nothing
the
hymns
of
david
the
plays
of
shakespeare
the
metaphysics
of
descartes
the
crimes
of
borgia
the
virtues
of
antonine
the
atheism
of
yesterday
and
the
materialism
of
were
all
emanations
of
divine
thought
doing
their
appointed
work
it
was
the
duty
of
the
church
to
deal
with
them
all
not
as
though
they
existed
through
a
power
hostile
to
the
deity
but
as
instruments
of
the
deity
to
work
out
his
unrevealed
ends
the
preacher
then
went
on
to
criticise
the
attitude
of
religion
towards
science
if
there
is
still
a
feeling
of
hostility
between
them
he
said
it
is
no
longer
the
fault
of
religion
there
have
been
times
when
the
church
seemed
afraid
but
she
is
so
no
longer
analyze
dissect
use
your
microscope
or
your
spectrum
till
the
last
atom
of
matter
is
reached
reflect
and
refine
till
the
last
element
of
thought
is
made
clear
the
church
now
knows
with
the
certainty
of
science
what
she
once
knew
only
by
the
certainty
of
faith
that
you
will
find
enthroned
behind
all
thought
and
matter
only
one
central
idea
that
idea
which
the
church
has
never
ceased
to
embody
i
am
science
like
religion
kneels
before
this
mystery
it
can
carry
itself
back
only
to
this
simple
consciousness
of
existence
i
am
is
the
starting
point
and
goal
of
metaphysics
and
logic
but
the
church
alone
has
pointed
out
from
the
beginning
that
this
is
not
human
but
divine
the
philosopher
says
i
am
and
the
church
scouts
his
philosophy
she
answers
no
you
are
not
you
have
no
existence
of
your
own
you
were
and
are
and
ever
will
be
only
a
part
of
the
supreme
i
am
of
which
the
church
is
the
emblem
in
this
symbolic
expression
of
his
right
of
property
in
their
souls
and
bodies
perhaps
the
preacher
rose
a
little
above
the
heads
of
his
audience
most
of
his
flock
were
busied
with
a
kind
of
speculation
so
foreign
to
that
of
metaphysics
that
they
would
have
been
puzzled
to
explain
what
was
meant
by
descartes
famous
cogito
ergo
sum
on
which
the
preacher
laid
so
much
stress
they
would
have
preferred
to
put
the
fact
of
their
existence
on
almost
any
other
experience
in
life
as
that
i
have
five
millions
or
i
am
the
woman
in
the
church
therefore
i
am
somebody
the
fact
of
would
not
have
struck
them
as
warranting
a
claim
even
to
a
good
social
position
much
less
to
a
share
in
omnipotence
they
knew
the
trait
only
as
a
sign
of
bad
manners
yet
there
were
at
least
two
persons
among
the
glorified
chrysanthemums
of
john
garden
this
day
who
as
the
sermon
closed
and
the
organ
burst
out
again
glanced
at
each
other
with
a
smile
as
though
they
had
enjoyed
their
lecture
good
said
the
man
he
takes
hold
i
hope
he
believes
it
all
said
his
companion
yes
he
has
put
his
life
into
the
idea
replied
the
man
even
at
college
he
would
have
sent
us
all
off
to
the
stake
with
a
sweet
smile
for
the
love
of
christ
and
the
glory
of
the
english
episcopal
church
the
crowd
soon
began
to
pour
slowly
out
of
the
building
and
the
two
observers
were
swept
along
with
the
rest
until
at
length
they
found
themselves
outside
and
strolled
down
the
avenue
a
voice
from
behind
stopped
them
esther
it
called
esther
turned
and
greeted
the
caller
as
aunt
she
was
a
woman
of
about
fifty
still
rather
handsome
but
with
features
to
which
time
had
given
an
expression
of
character
and
will
that
harmonized
only
with
a
manner
a
little
abrupt
and
decided
she
had
the
air
of
a
woman
who
knew
her
own
mind
and
commonly
had
her
own
way
well
esther
i
am
glad
to
see
you
taking
george
to
church
has
he
behaved
himself
you
are
wrong
again
aunt
sarah
said
george
it
is
i
who
have
been
taking
esther
to
church
i
thought
it
was
worth
seeing
church
is
always
worth
seeing
george
and
i
hope
your
friend
mr
hazard
sermon
has
done
you
good
it
did
me
good
to
see
wharton
there
answered
george
he
looked
as
though
it
were
a
first
representation
and
he
were
in
a
stage
box
hazard
and
he
ought
to
have
appeared
before
the
curtain
hand
in
hand
and
made
little
speeches
i
felt
like
calling
them
out
what
did
you
think
of
it
esther
asked
her
aunt
i
thought
it
very
entertaining
aunt
sarah
i
felt
like
a
butterfly
in
a
tulip
bed
mr
hazard
eyes
are
wonderful
i
shall
never
get
you
two
to
be
reverential
said
her
aunt
sternly
it
was
the
best
sermon
i
ever
heard
and
i
would
like
to
hear
you
answer
it
george
and
make
your
answer
as
little
scientific
as
you
can
aunt
sarah
i
never
answered
any
one
in
my
life
not
even
you
or
esther
or
the
man
who
said
that
my
fossil
bird
was
a
crocodile
why
do
you
want
me
to
answer
him
because
i
do
believe
you
can
i
ca
i
am
a
professor
of
paleontology
at
the
college
and
i
answer
questions
about
bones
you
must
get
my
colleague
who
does
the
metaphysics
to
answer
hazard
sermon
hazard
and
i
have
had
it
out
fifty
times
and
discussed
the
whole
subject
till
night
reeled
but
we
never
got
within
shouting
distance
of
each
other
he
might
as
well
have
stood
on
the
earth
and
i
on
the
nearest
planet
and
bawled
across
so
we
have
given
it
up
you
mean
that
you
were
beaten
rejoined
his
aunt
i
am
glad
you
feel
it
though
i
always
knew
it
was
so
after
all
mr
hazard
has
got
more
saints
on
his
church
walls
than
he
will
ever
see
in
his
audience
though
not
such
pretty
ones
i
never
saw
so
many
lovely
faces
and
dresses
together
esther
how
is
your
father
not
very
well
aunt
he
wants
to
see
you
come
home
with
us
and
help
us
to
amuse
him
so
talking
all
three
walked
along
the
avenue
to
street
and
turning
down
it
at
length
entered
one
of
the
houses
about
half
way
between
the
avenues
in
a
sunny
room
fitted
up
as
a
library
and
large
enough
to
be
handsome
they
found
the
owner
william
dudley
a
man
of
sixty
or
thereabouts
sitting
in
an
before
the
fire
trying
to
read
a
foreign
review
in
which
he
took
no
interest
he
moved
with
an
appearance
of
effort
as
though
he
were
an
invalid
but
his
voice
was
strong
and
his
manner
cheerful
i
hoped
you
would
all
come
this
is
an
awful
moment
tell
me
instantly
sarah
is
stephen
a
success
immense
stephen
and
wharton
too
the
loveliest
clergyman
the
sweetest
church
the
sermon
and
the
walls
said
she
even
george
owns
that
he
has
no
criticisms
to
make
aunt
sarah
tells
the
loftiest
truth
uncle
william
said
the
professor
every
christian
emblem
about
the
church
is
superlatively
correct
but
paleontologically
it
is
a
fraud
wharton
and
hazard
did
the
emblems
and
i
supplied
them
with
antediluvian
beasts
which
were
all
right
when
i
drew
them
but
wharton
has
played
the
devil
with
them
and
i
do
believe
he
knows
the
difference
between
a
saurian
and
a
crab
i
could
not
recognize
one
of
my
own
offspring
and
how
did
it
suit
you
esther
i
am
charmed
replied
his
daughter
only
it
certainly
does
come
just
a
little
near
being
an
mr
hazard
looks
horribly
like
meyerbeer
prophet
he
ordered
us
about
in
a
fine
tenor
voice
with
his
eyes
and
told
us
that
we
belonged
to
him
and
if
we
did
not
behave
ourselves
he
would
blow
up
the
church
and
us
in
it
i
thought
every
moment
we
should
see
his
mother
come
out
of
the
front
pews
and
have
a
scene
with
him
if
the
organ
had
played
the
march
the
effect
would
have
been
complete
but
i
felt
there
was
something
wanting
it
was
the
sexton
said
the
professor
he
ought
to
have
had
a
medieval
costume
i
must
tell
wharton
to
invent
one
for
him
hazard
has
asked
me
to
come
round
to
his
rooms
because
he
thinks
i
am
an
unprejudiced
observer
and
will
tell
him
the
exact
truth
now
what
am
i
to
say
tell
him
said
the
aunt
that
he
looked
like
a
christian
martyr
defying
the
beasts
in
the
amphitheater
and
george
you
are
one
of
them
between
you
and
your
uncle
william
i
wonder
how
esther
and
i
keep
any
religion
at
all
it
is
not
enough
to
save
you
aunt
sarah
replied
the
professor
you
might
just
as
well
go
with
us
for
if
the
church
is
half
right
you
have
a
chance
just
now
i
must
go
with
my
husband
who
is
not
much
better
than
you
she
replied
he
must
have
his
luncheon
church
or
no
church
so
she
departed
notifying
esther
that
the
next
day
there
was
to
be
at
her
house
a
meeting
of
the
executive
committee
of
the
hospital
which
esther
must
be
careful
to
attend
when
she
was
out
of
the
room
the
professor
turned
to
his
uncle
and
said
seriously
uncle
william
i
wish
you
knew
stephen
hazard
he
is
a
pleasant
fellow
in
or
out
of
the
pulpit
and
would
amuse
you
if
you
and
esther
will
come
to
tea
some
afternoon
at
my
rooms
i
will
get
hazard
and
wharton
and

dudley

in
his
life

the
professor
warmly

the
most
rational
unaffected
parson
in
the
world
he
likes
fun

much
as

any
other
man
and
is
interested
in
every
thing
i
will
come
if
esther
will
let
me
said
dudley
what
have
you
to
say
about
it
esther
i
do
think
it
would
hurt
you
father
george
building
has
an
elevator
i
did
mean
that
you
i
meant
to
ask
whether
you
wanted
to
go
to
george
tea
party
i
should
like
it
of
all
things
mr
hazard
wo
hurt
me
and
i
always
like
to
meet
mr
wharton
then
i
will
ask
both
of
them
this
evening
for
some
day
next
week
or
the
week
after
and
will
let
you
know
said
george
is
he
easily
shocked
asked
dudley
am
i
to
do
the
puritan
with
him
or
what
stephen
hazard
replied
the
professor
is
as
much
a
man
of
the
world
as
you
or
i
he
is
only
we
were
at
college
together
took
our
degrees
together
went
abroad
at
the
same
time
and
to
the
same
german
university
he
had
then
more
money
than
i
and
traveled
longer
went
to
the
east
studied
a
little
of
every
thing
lived
some
time
in
paris
where
he
discovered
wharton
and
at
last
some
few
years
ago
came
home
to
take
a
church
at
cincinnati
where
he
made
himself
a
power
i
thought
he
made
a
mistake
in
leaving
there
to
come
to
john
and
wrote
him
so
i
thought
if
he
came
here
he
would
find
that
he
had
no
regular
community
to
deal
with
but
just
an
arab
horde
and
that
it
was
nonsense
to
talk
of
saving
the
souls
of
new
yorkers
who
have
no
souls
to
be
saved
but
he
thought
it
his
duty
to
take
the
offer
aunt
sarah
hit
it
right
when
she
called
him
a
christian
martyr
in
the
amphitheater
at
college
we
used
to
call
him
stephen
he
had
this
same
idea
that
the
church
was
every
thing
and
that
every
thing
belonged
to
the
church
when
i
told
him
that
he
was
a
common
nuisance
and
that
i
had
to
work
for
him
like
a
he
laughed
as
though
it
were
a
joke
and
seriously
told
me
it
was
all
right
and
he
did
mind
my
skepticism
at
all
i
know
he
was
laughing
at
me
this
morning
when
he
made
me
go
to
church
for
the
first
time
in
ten
years
to
hear
that
sermon
which
not
twenty
people
there
understood
one
always
has
to
pay
for
one
friend
hobbies
said
dudley
i
am
glad
he
has
had
a
success
if
we
keep
a
church
we
ought
to
do
it
in
the
best
style
what
will
you
give
me
for
my
pew
i
never
sat
in
a
worse
growled
strong
i
not
change
it
then
said
dudley
i
make
esther
use
it
to
mortify
her
pride
better
make
it
over
to
the
poor
of
the
parish
said
the
professor
you
will
get
no
thanks
for
it
even
from
them
dudley
laughed
as
though
it
were
no
affair
of
his
and
in
fact
he
never
sat
in
his
pew
and
never
expected
to
do
so
he
had
no
taste
for
a
lawyer
in
moderate
practice
with
active
interest
in
public
affairs
when
the
civil
war
broke
out
he
took
a
commission
as
captain
in
a
new
york
regiment
and
after
distinguishing
himself
was
brought
home
a
colonel
with
a
bullet
through
his
body
and
a
saber
cut
across
his
head
he
recovered
his
health
or
as
much
of
it
as
a
man
can
expect
to
recover
after
such
treatment
and
went
back
to
the
law
but
coming
by
inheritance
into
a
property
large
enough
to
make
him
indifferent
to
his
profession
and
having
an
only
child
whose
mother
was
long
since
dead
he
amused
the
rest
of
his
life
by
spoiling
this
girl
esther
was
now
years
old
and
for
fifteen
years
had
been
absolute
mistress
of
her
father
house
her
aunt
sarah
known
in
new
york
as
john
murray
of
street
was
the
only
person
of
whom
she
was
a
little
a
very
little
afraid
of
her
cousin
george
she
was
not
in
the
least
afraid
although
george
strong
spoke
with
authority
in
the
world
when
he
cared
to
speak
at
all
he
was
rich
and
his
professorship
was
little
more
to
him
than
a
way
of
spending
money
he
had
no
parents
and
no
relations
besides
the
dudleys
and
the
murrays
alone
in
the
world
george
strong
looked
upon
himself
as
having
in
esther
a
younger
sister
whom
he
liked
and
a
sort
of
older
sister
whom
he
also
liked
in
his
aunt
sarah
when
after
lunching
with
the
dudleys
professor
strong
walked
down
fifth
avenue
to
his
club
he
looked
to
the
thousand
people
whom
he
passed
like
what
he
was
an
intelligent
man
with
a
figure
made
for
action
an
eye
that
hated
rest
and
a
manner
naturally
sympathetic
his
forehead
was
so
bald
as
to
give
his
face
a
look
of
strong
character
which
a
dark
beard
rather
helped
to
increase
he
was
a
popular
fellow
known
as
george
by
whole
gangs
of
the
roughest
miners
in
nevada
where
he
had
worked
for
years
as
a
practical
geologist
and
it
would
have
been
hard
to
find
in
america
europe
or
asia
a
city
in
which
some
one
would
not
have
smiled
at
the
mention
of
his
name
and
asked
where
george
was
going
to
turn
up
next
he
kept
his
word
that
evening
with
his
friend
hazard
at
nine
he
was
at
the
house
next
door
to
john
church
where
the
new
clergyman
was
trying
to
feel
himself
at
home
in
a
large
library
with
to
the
ceiling
and
books
lying
in
piles
on
the
floor
with
pictures
engravings
and
etchings
leaning
against
the
books
and
the
walls
and
every
sort
of
literary
encumbrance
scattered
in
the
way
of
heedless
feet
in
the
midst
of
confusion
confounded
mr
hazard
was
stretched
on
a
sofa
trying
to
read
but
worn
out
by
fatigue
and
excitement
though
his
chaos
had
not
settled
into
order
it
was
easy
to
read
his
character
from
his
surroundings
the
books
were
not
all
divinity
there
were
classics
of
every
kind
even
to
a
collection
of
eastern
literature
a
mass
of
poetry
in
all
languages
not
a
few
novels
and
what
was
most
conspicuous
an
elaborate
collection
of
illustrated
works
on
art
egyptian
greek
roman
medieval
mexican
japanese
indian
and
whatever
else
had
come
in
his
way
add
to
this
a
shelf
of
music
and
then
construct
the
tall
slender
figure
lying
exhausted
on
the
sofa
he
rose
to
greet
strong
with
a
laugh
like
a
boy
and
cried
well
skeptic
how
do
the
heathen
rage
the
heathen
are
all
right
replied
strong
the
orthodox
are
the
ragers
never
mind
the
orthodox
said
hazard
i
will
look
after
them
tell
me
about
the
pagans
i
felt
like
paul
preaching
at
athens
the
god
whom
they
ignorantly
worshiped
i
took
with
me
the
sternest
little
pagan
i
know
my
cousin
esther
dudley
said
strong
and
the
only
question
she
asked
was
whether
you
believed
it
all
she
hit
the
mark
at
the
first
shot
answered
hazard
i
must
make
them
all
ask
that
question
tell
me
about
your
cousin
who
is
she
her
name
sounds
familiar
as
familiar
as
hawthorne
replied
strong
one
of
his
tales
is
called
after
it
her
father
comes
from
a
branch
of
the
old
puritan
dudleys
and
took
a
fancy
to
the
name
when
he
met
it
in
hawthorne
story
you
never
heard
of
them
before
because
you
have
been
always
away
from
new
york
and
when
you
were
here
they
happened
to
be
away
you
know
that
half
a
dozen
women
run
this
city
and
my
aunt
murray
is
one
of
the
she
is
training
esther
to
take
her
place
when
she
retires
i
want
you
to
know
my
uncle
dudley
and
my
cousin
i
am
going
to
have
a
little
for
them
in
my
rooms
and
you
must
help
me
with
it
mr
hazard
asked
only
to
have
it
put
off
until
the
week
after
the
next
because
of
his
engagements
and
hardly
had
they
fixed
the
day
when
another
caller
appeared
he
was
a
man
of
their
own
age
so
quiet
and
subdued
in
manner
and
so
delicate
in
feature
that
he
would
have
been
unnoticed
in
any
ordinary
group
and
shoved
aside
into
a
corner
he
seemed
to
face
life
with
an
effort
his
eyes
had
an
uneasy
look
as
though
they
wanted
to
rest
on
something
that
should
be
less
hard
and
real
than
what
they
saw
he
was
not
handsome
his
mouth
was
a
little
sensual
his
yellowish
beard
was
ragged
he
was
apt
to
be
silent
until
his
shyness
wore
off
when
he
became
a
rapid
nervous
talker
full
of
theories
and
schemes
which
he
changed
from
one
day
to
another
but
which
were
always
quite
complete
and
convincing
for
the
moment
at
times
he
had
long
fits
of
moodiness
and
would
not
open
his
mouth
for
days
at
other
times
he
sought
society
and
sat
up
all
night
talking
planning
discussing
drinking
smoking
living
on
bread
and
cheese
or
whatever
happened
to
be
within
reach
and
sleeping
whenever
he
happened
to
feel
in
the
humor
for
it
rule
or
method
he
had
none
and
his
friends
had
for
years
given
up
the
attempt
to
control
him
they
took
it
for
granted
that
he
would
soon
kill
himself
with
his
existence
hazard
thought
that
his
lungs
would
give
way
and
strong
insisted
that
his
brain
was
the
weak
spot
and
no
one
ventured
to
hope
that
he
would
long
hold
out
but
he
lived
on
in
defiance
of
them
good
evening
wharton
said
the
clergyman
i
have
been
trying
to
find
out
from
strong
what
the
heathen
think
of
me
tell
us
now
the
art
view
of
the
case
how
are
you
satisfied
tell
me
what
you
were
sketching
in
church
said
strong
was
it
not
the
new
martyrdom
of
st
stephen
no
answered
wharton
quietly
it
was
my
own
i
found
i
could
not
look
up
i
knew
how
bad
my
own
work
was
and
i
could
not
stand
seeing
it
so
i
drew
my
own
martyrdom
rather
than
make
a
scandal
by
leaving
the
church
did
you
hear
my
sermon
asked
the
clergyman
i
do
remember
answered
wharton
vaguely
what
was
it
about
strong
and
hazard
broke
into
a
laugh
which
roused
him
to
the
energy
of
i
never
could
listen
he
said
it
is
a
slow
and
stupid
faculty
an
artist
business
is
only
to
see
and
i
could
see
nothing
but
my
own
things
which
are
all
bad
the
whole
church
is
bad
it
is
not
altogether
worth
a
bit
of
japanese
enamel
that
i
have
brought
round
here
this
evening
to
show
strong
he
searched
first
in
one
pocket
then
in
another
until
he
found
what
he
wanted
in
the
pocket
of
his
overcoat
and
a
warm
discussion
at
once
began
between
him
and
strong
who
declared
that
he
had
a
better
piece
mine
was
given
me
by
a
daimio
in
kiusiu
said
strong
it
is
the
best
old
bit
you
ever
saw
come
round
to
my
rooms
a
week
from
at
five
in
the
afternoon
and
i
will
show
you
all
my
new
japs
the
dudleys
are
coming
to
see
them
and
my
aunt
murray
and
hazard
has
promised
to
come
i
saw
you
had
miss
dudley
with
you
at
church
this
morning
said
wharton
still
absorbed
in
study
of
his
enamel
and
quite
unconscious
of
his
host
evident
restlessness
ah
then
you
could
see
miss
dudley
cried
the
clergyman
who
could
not
forgive
the
abrupt
dismissal
of
his
own
affairs
by
the
two
men
and
was
eager
to
bring
the
talk
back
to
his
church
i
can
always
see
miss
dudley
said
wharton
quietly
why
asked
hazard
she
is
interesting
replied
the
painter
she
has
a
style
of
her
own
and
i
never
can
quite
make
up
my
mind
whether
to
like
it
or
not
it
is
the
first
time
i
ever
knew
you
to
hesitate
before
a
style
said
hazard
i
hesitate
before
every
thing
american
replied
wharton
beginning
to
show
a
shade
of
interest
in
what
he
was
talking
of
i
do
know
you
do
know
and
i
never
yet
met
any
man
who
could
tell
me
whether
american
types
are
going
to
supplant
the
old
ones
or
whether
they
are
to
come
to
nothing
for
want
of
ideas
miss
dudley
is
one
of
the
most
marked
american
types
i
ever
saw
what
are
the
signs
of
the
most
marked
american
type
you
ever
saw
asked
hazard
in
the
first
place
she
has
a
bad
figure
which
she
makes
answer
for
a
good
one
she
is
too
slight
too
thin
she
looks
fragile
willowy
as
the
cheap
novels
call
it
as
though
you
could
break
her
in
halves
like
a
switch
she
dresses
to
suit
her
figure
and
sometimes
overdoes
it
her
features
are
imperfect
except
her
ears
her
voice
and
her
eyes
which
have
a
sort
of
brown
depth
like
a
trout
brook
she
has
no
very
good
points
then
why
do
you
hesitate
asked
strong
who
was
not
entirely
pleased
with
this
cool
estimate
of
his
cousin
person
there
is
the
point
where
the
subtlety
comes
in
replied
the
painter
miss
dudley
interests
me
i
want
to
know
what
she
can
make
of
life
she
gives
one
the
idea
of
a
yacht
in
unexpected
you
ask
yourself
what
the
devil
she
is
doing
there
she
sails
gayly
along
though
there
is
no
land
in
sight
and
plenty
of
rough
weather
coming
she
never
read
a
book
i
believe
in
her
life
she
tries
to
paint
but
she
is
only
a
second
rate
amateur
and
will
never
be
any
thing
more
though
she
has
done
one
or
two
things
which
i
give
you
my
word
i
would
like
to
have
done
myself
she
picks
up
all
she
knows
without
an
effort
and
knows
nothing
well
yet
she
seems
to
understand
whatever
is
said
her
mind
is
as
irregular
as
her
face
and
both
have
the
same
peculiarity
i
notice
that
the
lines
of
her
eyebrows
nose
and
mouth
all
end
with
a
slight
upward
curve
like
a
yacht
sails
which
gives
a
kind
of
hopefulness
and
to
her
expression
mind
and
face
have
the
same
curves
is
that
your
idea
of
our
national
type
asked
strong
why
do
you
put
it
into
one
of
your
saints
in
the
church
and
show
what
you
mean
by
american
art
i
wish
i
could
said
the
artist
i
have
passed
weeks
trying
to
catch
it
the
thing
is
too
subtle
and
it
is
not
a
grand
type
like
what
we
are
used
to
in
the
academies
but
besides
the
riddle
i
like
miss
dudley
for
herself
the
way
she
takes
my
brutal
criticisms
of
her
painting
makes
my
heart
bleed
i
mean
to
go
down
on
my
knees
one
of
these
days
and
confess
to
her
that
i
know
nothing
about
it
only
if
her
style
is
right
my
art
is
wrong
what
sort
of
a
world
does
this
new
deity
of
yours
belong
to
asked
the
clergyman
not
to
yours
replied
wharton
quickly
there
is
nothing
medieval
about
her
if
she
belongs
to
any
besides
the
present
it
is
to
the
next
world
which
artists
want
to
see
when
paganism
will
come
again
and
we
can
give
a
divinity
to
every
waterfall
i
tell
you
hazard
i
am
sick
at
heart
about
our
church
work
it
is
a
failure
never
till
this
morning
did
i
feel
the
whole
truth
but
the
instant
i
got
inside
the
doors
it
flashed
upon
me
like
paul
great
light
the
thing
does
not
belong
to
our
time
or
feelings
the
conversation
having
thus
come
round
to
the
subject
which
mr
hazard
wanted
to
discuss
the
three
men
plunged
deep
into
serious
talk
which
lasted
till
after
midnight
had
struck
from
the
neighboring
church
punctually
the
next
day
at
three
esther
dudley
appeared
in
her
aunt
where
she
found
half
a
dozen
ladies
chatting
or
looking
at
murray
pictures
in
the
front
parlor
the
lady
of
the
house
sat
in
an
before
the
fire
in
an
inner
room
talking
with
two
other
ladies
of
the
board
one
of
whom
with
an
aggressive
and
superior
manner
seemed
finding
fault
with
every
thing
except
the
middle
ages
and
pericles
a
tailor
who
builds
a
palace
to
live
in
said
she
is
a
vulgar
tailor
and
an
artist
who
paints
the
tailor
and
his
palace
as
though
he
were
painting
a
doge
of
venice
is
a
vulgar
artist
but
dyer
replied
her
hostess
coldly
i
do
believe
there
was
any
real
difference
between
a
doge
of
venice
and
a
doge
of
new
york
they
all
made
fortunes
more
or
less
by
cheating
their
neighbors
and
when
they
were
rich
they
wanted
portraits
some
one
told
them
to
send
for
tizian
or
wharton
and
he
made
of
them
all
the
gentlemen
there
ever
were
dyer
frowned
a
protest
against
this
heresy
tizian
would
have
respected
his
art
said
she
these
new
york
men
are
making
money
for
my
part
said
murray
as
gently
as
she
could
i
am
grateful
to
any
one
who
likes
beautiful
things
and
is
willing
to
pay
for
them
and
i
hope
the
artists
will
make
them
as
beautiful
as
they
can
for
the
money
the
number
is
small
with
this
she
rose
and
moving
to
the
table
called
her
meeting
to
order
the
ladies
seated
themselves
in
a
way
round
about
and
listened
with
masculine
gravity
to
a
long
written
report
on
the
work
done
or
needing
to
be
done
at
the
children
hospital
debate
rose
on
the
question
of
putting
in
a
new
kitchen
range
and
renewing
the
plumbing
dyer
took
the
floor
or
the
table
very
much
to
herself
dealing
severely
with
the
treatment
of
the
late
kitchen
range
and
bringing
numerous
complaints
against
the
matron
the
management
and
the
hospital
in
general
there
was
an
evident
look
of
weariness
on
the
part
of
the
board
when
she
began
but
not
until
after
a
two
hours
session
did
she
show
signs
of
exhaustion
and
allow
a
vote
to
be
taken
the
necessary
work
was
then
rapidly
done
and
at
last
murray
referring
in
a
way
to
her
notes
remarked
that
she
had
nothing
more
to
suggest
except
that
mr
hazard
the
new
clergyman
at
john
should
be
elected
as
a
member
of
their
visiting
committee
do
we
want
more
there
asked
dyer
every
day
and
every
hour
of
mr
hazard
time
ought
to
be
devoted
to
his
church
what
we
want
is
workers
we
have
no
one
to
look
after
the
children
clothes
and
go
down
into
the
kitchen
all
our
visitors
are
good
for
is
to
amuse
the
children
for
half
an
hour
now
and
then
by
telling
them
stories
murray
explained
that
the
election
was
rather
a
matter
of
custom
that
the
rector
of
john
always
had
been
a
member
of
their
committee
and
it
would
look
like
a
personal
slight
if
they
left
him
off
so
the
vote
was
passed
and
the
meeting
broke
up
when
the
last
echo
of
rapid
talk
and
had
ceased
murray
sat
down
again
before
the
fire
with
the
air
of
one
who
has
tried
to
keep
her
temper
and
has
not
thoroughly
satisfied
her
ambition
dyer
is
very
trying
she
said
to
esther
who
stayed
after
the
others
went
but
there
is
always
one
such
woman
on
every
board
i
should
not
care
except
that
she
gives
me
a
dreadful
feeling
that
i
am
like
her
i
hope
i
not
but
i
know
i
am
you
not
aunt
sarah
replied
esther
she
can
stick
pins
faster
and
deeper
than
a
dozen
such
as
you
what
makes
me
unhappy
is
that
her
spitefulness
goes
so
deep
her
dig
at
me
about
telling
stories
to
the
children
seemed
to
cut
me
up
by
the
roots
all
i
do
is
to
tell
them
stories
i
hope
she
will
never
make
herself
useful
in
that
way
rejoined
murray
grimly
she
would
frighten
the
poor
little
things
into
convulsions
do
let
her
worry
you
about
usefulness
one
of
these
days
you
will
have
to
be
useful
whether
you
like
it
or
not
and
now
you
are
doing
enough
if
you
are
only
ornamental
i
know
you
will
hold
your
tongue
at
the
board
meetings
and
that
is
real
usefulness
very
well
aunt
i
can
do
that
and
i
can
go
on
cutting
out
clothes
for
the
children
though
dyer
will
complain
that
my
dolls
are
not
sufficiently
dressed
i
wish
i
did
not
respect
people
for
despising
me
if
we
did
not
there
would
be
no
dyers
answered
her
aunt
she
is
a
terrible
woman
i
feel
always
like
a
sort
of
dry
when
she
has
left
me
never
mind
i
have
something
else
now
to
talk
about
i
want
you
to
make
yourself
useful
in
a
harder
path
not
another
charity
board
aunt
said
esther
rather
piteously
worse
said
murray
a
charity
girl
thirty
years
ago
i
had
a
dear
friend
who
was
also
a
friend
of
your
poor
mother
her
name
was
catherine
cortright
she
married
a
man
named
brooke
and
they
went
west
and
they
kept
going
further
and
further
west
until
at
length
they
reached
colorado
where
she
died
leaving
one
daughter
a
child
of
ten
years
old
the
father
married
again
and
had
a
new
family
very
lately
he
has
died
leaving
the
girl
with
her
and
she
is
unhappy
there
they
seem
to
have
brought
her
up
in
a
strict
presbyterian
kind
of
way
and
she
does
not
like
it
murray
is
an
executor
under
her
father
will
and
when
she
comes
of
age
in
a
few
months
she
will
have
a
little
independent
property
she
has
asked
me
to
look
after
her
till
then
and
is
coming
on
at
once
to
make
me
a
visit
you
are
always
doing
something
for
somebody
said
esther
what
do
you
expect
her
to
be
and
how
long
will
she
stay
i
do
expect
any
thing
my
dear
and
my
heart
sinks
whenever
i
think
of
her
my
letters
say
she
is
amiable
and
pretty
but
if
she
is
a
rattlesnake
i
must
take
her
in
and
you
must
help
to
amuse
her
i
will
do
all
i
can
replied
esther
do
be
low
about
it
she
be
as
bad
as
dyer
even
if
she
is
a
rattlesnake
if
she
is
pretty
and
turns
out
well
we
will
make
george
marry
her
i
wish
we
might
said
her
aunt
esther
went
her
way
and
thought
no
more
of
the
orphan
but
murray
carried
the
weight
of
all
new
york
on
her
mind
not
the
least
of
her
anxieties
was
the
condition
of
her
esther
father
he
was
now
a
confirmed
invalid
grateful
for
society
and
amusement
and
almost
every
day
he
expected
his
to
take
him
to
drive
if
the
weather
was
tolerable
the
tax
was
severe
but
she
bore
it
with
heroism
and
his
gratitude
sustained
her
when
she
came
for
him
the
next
morning
she
found
him
reading
as
usual
and
waiting
for
her
i
was
just
wondering
said
he
whether
i
could
read
five
minutes
longer
without
a
stimulant
do
you
know
that
indiscriminate
reading
is
a
fiendish
torture
no
convict
could
stand
it
i
seldom
take
up
a
book
in
these
days
without
thinking
how
much
more
amusing
it
would
be
to
jolt
off
on
a
bright
day
at
the
head
of
a
funeral
procession
between
the
two
ways
of
amusing
i
am
principled
against
books
you
have
a
very
rough
way
of
expressing
your
tastes
said
murray
with
a
shiver
as
they
got
into
her
carriage
do
you
know
i
never
could
understand
the
humor
of
joking
about
funerals
that
surprises
me
said
dudley
a
good
funeral
needs
a
joke
if
mine
is
not
more
amusing
than
my
friends
i
would
rather
not
go
to
it
the
kind
of
funeral
i
am
invited
to
has
no
sort
of
charm
indeed
i
do
know
that
i
was
ever
asked
to
one
that
seemed
to
me
to
show
an
elegant
hospitality
in
the
host
if
you
ca
amuse
me
better
william
i
will
drive
you
home
again
said
his
not
quite
yet
i
have
something
more
to
say
on
this
business
of
funerals
which
is
just
now
not
a
little
on
my
mind
are
you
joking
now
or
serious
asked
murray
i
can
not
myself
see
any
humor
in
what
i
have
to
say
replied
dudley
but
i
am
told
that
even
professional
humorists
seldom
enjoy
jokes
at
their
own
expense
the
case
is
this
my
doctors
who
give
me
their
word
of
honor
that
they
are
not
more
ignorant
than
the
average
of
their
profession
told
me
long
ago
that
i
might
die
at
any
moment
i
knew
then
that
i
must
be
quite
safe
and
thought
no
more
about
it
their
first
guess
was
wrong
instead
of
going
off
suddenly
and
without
notice
as
a
colonel
of
new
york
volunteers
should
i
began
last
summer
to
go
off
by
bits
as
though
i
were
ashamed
to
be
seen
running
away
this
time
the
doctors
wo
say
any
thing
which
alarms
me
i
have
watched
myself
and
them
for
some
weeks
until
i
feel
pretty
confident
that
i
had
better
get
ready
to
start
all
through
life
i
have
been
thinking
how
i
could
best
get
out
of
it
and
on
the
whole
i
am
well
enough
satisfied
with
this
way
except
on
esther
account
and
it
is
about
her
that
i
want
to
consult
you
murray
knew
her
too
well
to
irritate
him
by
condolence
or
sympathy
she
said
only
why
be
anxious
esther
can
take
care
of
herself
perhaps
she
will
marry
but
if
not
she
has
nothing
to
fear
the
unmarried
women
nowadays
are
better
off
than
the
married
ones
oh
said
dudley
with
his
usual
air
of
deep
gravity
it
is
not
she
but
her
husband
who
is
on
my
mind
i
have
hated
the
fellow
all
his
life
about
twice
a
year
i
have
treacherously
stabbed
him
in
the
back
as
he
was
going
out
of
my
own
front
door
i
knew
that
he
would
interfere
with
my
comfort
if
i
let
him
get
a
footing
after
all
he
was
always
a
poor
creature
and
did
not
deserve
to
live
my
conscience
does
not
reproach
me
but
now
when
i
am
weak
and
his
ghost
rises
in
an
irrepressible
manner
and
grins
at
me
on
my
own
threshold
i
begin
to
feel
a
sort
of
pity
mingled
with
contempt
i
want
to
show
charity
to
him
before
i
die
what
on
earth
do
you
mean
asked
his
with
an
impatient
groan
for
thirty
years
i
have
been
trying
to
understand
you
and
you
grow
worse
every
year
now
i
am
not
surprised
to
hear
you
say
so
any
sympathy
for
the
husband
is
unusual
no
doubt
yet
i
am
not
prepared
to
admit
that
it
is
unintelligible
you
go
too
far
take
your
own
way
william
when
you
are
tired
let
me
know
what
it
is
that
you
think
i
can
do
i
want
you
to
find
the
poor
fellow
and
tell
him
that
i
bear
him
no
real
you
want
me
to
find
a
husband
for
esther
if
you
have
nothing
better
to
do
i
have
looked
rather
carefully
through
her
list
of
friends
and
taking
out
the
dancing
men
who
count
i
see
nobody
who
would
answer
except
perhaps
her
cousin
george
and
to
marry
him
would
be
she
might
as
well
marry
you
i
have
thought
a
great
deal
about
that
match
as
you
know
replied
murray
it
would
not
answer
i
could
get
over
the
cousinship
if
i
must
but
esther
will
want
a
husband
to
herself
and
george
is
a
vagabond
he
could
never
make
her
happy
george
had
the
said
dudley
to
inherit
a
small
spark
of
something
almost
like
genius
and
a
little
weak
genius
mixed
in
with
a
little
fortune
goes
a
long
way
towards
making
a
still
we
wo
exaggerate
george
genius
after
all
there
is
not
enough
of
it
to
prevent
his
being
the
best
of
the
lot
he
could
not
hold
her
a
week
said
murray
nor
she
him
i
own
that
on
his
wedding
day
he
would
probably
be
in
dakota
flirting
with
the
bones
of
a
fossil
monkey
said
dudley
thoughtfully
but
what
better
can
you
suggest
i
suggest
that
you
should
leave
it
alone
and
let
esther
take
care
of
her
own
husband
replied
murray
women
must
take
their
chance
it
is
what
they
are
for
marriage
makes
no
real
difference
in
their
lot
all
the
contented
women
are
fools
and
all
the
discontented
ones
want
to
be
men
women
are
a
blunder
in
the
creation
and
must
take
the
consequences
if
esther
is
sensible
she
will
never
marry
but
no
woman
is
sensible
so
she
will
marry
without
consulting
us
you
are
always
eloquent
on
this
subject
said
dudley
why
have
you
never
applied
for
a
divorce
from
poor
murray
because
murray
happens
to
be
one
man
in
a
million
answered
she
nothing
on
earth
would
induce
me
to
begin
over
again
and
take
such
a
risk
a
second
time
with
life
before
me
as
for
bringing
about
a
marriage
i
would
almost
rather
bring
about
a
murder
poor
esther
said
he
gloomily
she
has
been
brought
up
among
men
and
is
not
used
to
harness
if
things
go
wrong
she
will
rebel
and
a
woman
who
rebels
is
lost
esther
has
known
too
many
good
men
ever
to
marry
a
bad
one
she
replied
i
am
not
sure
of
that
he
answered
when
i
am
out
of
the
way
she
will
feel
lonely
and
any
man
who
wants
her
very
much
can
probably
get
her
joking
apart
it
is
there
i
want
your
help
keep
an
eye
on
her
your
principles
will
let
you
prevent
a
marriage
even
though
you
are
not
allowed
to
make
one
i
hope
she
will
not
want
my
help
in
either
way
said
murray
but
if
she
does
i
will
remember
what
you
say
though
i
would
rather
go
out
to
service
at
five
dollars
a
week
than
do
this
kind
of
work
do
you
know
that
i
have
already
a
girl
on
my
hands
poor
catherine
brooke
daughter
is
coming
from
colorado
to
be
under
my
care
for
the
next
few
months
till
she
is
of
age
she
never
has
been
to
the
east
and
i
expect
to
have
my
hands
full
if
i
had
known
it
said
he
i
think
i
would
have
selected
some
wiser
woman
to
look
after
esther
you
are
too
encouraging
replied
murray
if
i
talk
longer
with
you
i
shall
have
a
crying
fit
suppose
we
change
the
subject
and
amuse
ourselves
in
a
cheerfuller
way
they
finished
their
drive
talking
of
less
personal
matters
but
murray
after
leaving
her
at
his
house
went
back
to
her
own
with
spirits
depressed
to
a
point
as
low
as
any
woman
past
fifty
cares
to
enjoy
she
had
reason
to
know
that
dudley
was
not
mistaken
about
his
symptoms
and
that
not
many
months
could
pass
before
that
must
happen
which
he
foresaw
he
could
find
some
relief
in
talking
and
even
in
jesting
about
it
but
she
could
only
with
difficulty
keep
herself
from
an
outburst
of
grief
she
had
every
reason
to
feel
keenly
to
lose
one
oldest
friends
is
a
trial
that
human
nature
never
accustoms
itself
to
bear
with
satisfaction
even
when
the
loss
does
not
double
responsibilities
but
in
this
case
murray
as
she
grew
old
saw
her
niece
esther
about
to
come
on
her
hands
at
the
same
time
when
a
wild
girl
from
the
prairie
was
on
the
road
to
her
very
door
and
she
had
no
sufficient
authority
to
control
either
of
them
for
a
woman
without
children
of
her
own
to
act
this
part
of
matron
to
an
extemporized
girls
college
might
be
but
could
not
bring
repose
of
mind
or
body
murray
was
still
wider
awake
to
this
truth
when
she
went
the
next
day
to
the
grand
central
station
to
wait
for
the
arrival
of
her
colorado
orphan
the
chicago
express
glided
in
as
gracefully
and
silently
as
though
it
were
in
quite
the
best
society
and
had
run
a
thousand
miles
or
so
only
for
gentle
exercise
before
dining
at
delmonico
and
passing
an
evening
at
the
opera
among
the
crowd
of
passengers
who
passed
out
were
several
women
whose
appearance
gave
murray
a
pang
of
fear
but
at
length
she
caught
sight
of
one
who
pleased
her
fastidious
eye
i
hope
it
is
she
broke
from
her
lips
as
the
girl
came
towards
her
and
a
moment
later
her
hope
was
gratified
she
drew
a
breath
of
relief
that
made
her
whatever
faults
the
girl
might
have
want
of
charm
was
not
among
them
as
she
raised
her
veil
the
leaning
from
his
engine
above
them
nodded
approval
in
spite
of
dust
and
cinders
the
fatigue
and
exposure
of
two
thousand
miles
or
so
of
travel
the
girl
was
fresh
as
a
summer
morning
and
her
complexion
was
like
the
petals
of
a
sweetbrier
rose
her
dark
blue
woollen
dress
evidently
made
by
herself
soothed
murray
anxieties
more
completely
than
though
it
had
come
by
the
last
steamer
from
the
best
modiste
in
paris
is
it
possible
you
have
come
all
the
way
alone
she
asked
looking
about
with
lurking
suspicion
of
possible
lovers
still
to
be
revealed
only
from
chicago
answered
catherine
i
stopped
awhile
there
to
rest
but
i
had
friends
to
take
care
of
me
and
you
were
not
homesick
or
lonely
no
i
made
friends
on
the
cars
i
have
been
taking
care
of
a
sick
lady
and
her
three
children
who
are
all
on
their
way
to
europe
and
wanted
to
pay
my
expenses
if
i
would
go
with
them
i
do
wonder
said
murray
with
an
unusual
burst
of
sympathy
no
sooner
had
they
fairly
reached
the
house
than
esther
came
to
see
the
stranger
and
found
her
aunt
in
high
spirits
she
is
as
natural
and
sweet
as
a
flower
said
murray
to
be
sure
she
has
a
few
western
tricks
she
says
she
stopped
awhile
at
chicago
and
that
she
has
a
raft
of
things
in
her
trunks
and
she
asks
häow
and
says
äout
but
so
do
half
the
girls
in
new
york
and
i
will
break
her
of
it
in
a
week
so
that
you
will
never
know
she
was
not
educated
in
boston
and
finished
in
europe
i
was
terribly
afraid
she
would
wear
a
linen
duster
and
catherine
became
a
favorite
on
the
spot
no
one
could
resist
her
hazel
eyes
and
the
curve
of
her
neck
or
her
pure
complexion
which
had
the
transparency
of
a
colorado
sunrise
her
good
nature
was
inexhaustible
and
she
occasionally
developed
a
touch
of
sentiment
which
made
murray
assert
that
she
was
the
most
dangerous
coquette
within
his
experience
murray
who
had
a
sound
though
uncultivated
taste
for
pretty
girls
succumbed
to
her
charms
while
george
strong
whose
good
nature
was
very
like
her
own
never
tired
of
drawing
her
out
and
enjoying
her
comments
on
the
new
life
about
her
what
kind
of
a
revolver
do
you
carry
asked
george
gravely
at
his
first
interview
with
her
do
you
like
yours
heavy
or
say
a
ball
do
mind
him
catherine
said
murray
he
is
always
making
poor
jokes
oh
but
i
not
strong
enough
to
use
heavy
replied
catherine
quite
seriously
i
had
a
couple
of
light
ones
in
my
room
at
home
but
father
told
me
i
could
never
hurt
any
thing
with
them
and
i
never
did
always
missed
your
man
asked
george
i
never
fired
at
a
man
but
once
one
night
i
took
one
of
our
herders
for
a
thief
and
shot
at
him
but
i
missed
and
just
got
laughed
at
for
a
week
that
was
before
we
moved
down
to
denver
where
we
do
use
pistols
much
strong
felt
a
little
doubt
whether
she
was
making
fun
of
him
or
he
of
her
and
she
never
left
him
in
perfect
security
on
this
point
what
is
your
name
in
sioux
catherine
he
would
ask
laughing
strawberry
i
suppose
or
jumping
turtle
no
she
answered
i
have
a
very
pretty
name
in
sioux
they
call
me
the
sage
hen
because
i
am
so
quiet
i
like
it
much
better
than
my
own
name
strong
was
beaten
at
this
game
she
capped
all
his
questions
for
him
with
an
air
of
such
good
faith
as
made
him
helpless
whether
it
were
real
or
assumed
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
he
took
a
great
fancy
to
the
sage
hen
while
she
in
her
turn
took
a
violent
liking
for
esther
as
the
extremest
contrast
to
herself
when
esther
realized
that
this
product
of
colorado
was
likely
to
be
on
her
hands
for
several
hours
every
day
she
felt
less
amused
than
either
strong
or
murray
for
miss
brooke
conversation
though
entertaining
as
far
as
it
went
had
not
the
charm
of
variety
it
was
not
long
before
her
visits
to
studio
became
so
frequent
and
so
exhausting
that
esther
became
desperate
and
felt
that
some
relief
must
at
any
cost
be
found
the
poor
little
prairie
flower
found
new
york
at
first
exciting
she
felt
shy
and
awkward
among
the
swarms
of
strange
people
to
whose
houses
murray
soon
began
to
take
her
by
way
of
breaking
her
in
at
once
to
the
manners
of
new
york
society
and
whenever
she
could
escape
she
fled
to
esther
and
her
quiet
studio
with
the
feelings
of
a
bird
to
its
nest
the
only
drawback
to
her
pleasure
there
was
that
she
had
nothing
to
do
her
reading
seemed
to
have
been
entirely
in
books
of
a
severely
moral
caste
and
in
consequence
she
could
not
be
induced
to
open
so
much
as
a
magazine
she
preferred
to
chatter
about
herself
and
the
people
she
met
before
a
week
had
passed
esther
felt
that
something
must
be
done
to
lighten
this
burden
and
it
was
then
that
as
we
shall
see
mr
hazard
suggested
her
using
catherine
for
a
model
the
idea
might
not
have
been
so
easily
accepted
under
other
circumstances
but
it
seemed
for
the
moment
a
brilliant
one
as
wharton
had
said
of
esther
she
was
but
a
amateur
whether
there
was
a
living
artist
whom
wharton
would
have
classed
higher
than
a
amateur
is
doubtful
on
his
scale
to
be
was
a
fair
showing
esther
had
studied
under
good
masters
both
abroad
and
at
home
she
had
not
the
patience
to
be
thorough
but
who
had
she
asked
this
question
of
wharton
when
he
attacked
her
for
bad
drawing
and
wharton
answer
left
on
her
mind
the
impression
that
he
was
himself
the
only
thorough
artist
in
the
world
yet
others
with
whom
she
talked
hinted
much
the
same
thing
of
themselves
esther
at
all
events
painted
many
canvases
and
panels
good
or
bad
some
of
which
had
been
exhibited
and
had
even
been
sold
more
perhaps
owing
to
some
trick
of
the
imagination
which
she
had
put
into
them
than
to
their
technical
merit
yet
into
one
work
she
had
put
her
whole
soul
and
with
success
this
was
a
portrait
of
her
father
which
that
severe
critic
liked
well
enough
to
hang
on
the
wall
of
his
library
and
which
was
admitted
to
have
merits
even
by
wharton
though
he
said
that
its
unusual
and
rather
masculine
firmness
of
handling
was
due
to
the
subject
and
could
never
be
repeated
catherine
was
charmed
to
sit
for
her
portrait
it
was
touching
to
see
the
superstitious
reverence
with
which
this
prairie
child
kneeled
before
whatever
she
supposed
to
be
learned
or
artistic
she
took
it
for
granted
that
esther
painting
was
wonderful
her
only
difficulty
was
to
understand
how
a
man
so
trivial
as
george
strong
could
be
a
serious
professor
in
a
real
university
she
thought
that
strong
taste
for
was
another
of
his
jokes
he
tried
to
educate
her
and
had
almost
succeeded
when
in
producing
his
last
and
most
perfect
bit
of
japanese
lacquer
he
said
this
piece
catherine
is
too
pure
for
man
we
pray
to
it
catherine
sat
as
serious
as
eternity
but
she
believed
in
her
heart
that
he
was
making
fun
of
her
in
this
atmosphere
to
sit
for
her
portrait
was
happiness
because
it
made
her
a
part
of
her
society
esther
was
surprised
to
find
what
a
difficult
model
she
was
with
liquid
reflections
of
eyes
hair
and
skin
that
would
have
puzzled
correggio
of
course
she
was
to
be
painted
as
the
sage
hen
george
sent
for
sage
brush
and
got
a
stuffed
sage
hen
and
photographs
of
to
give
esther
the
local
color
for
her
picture
once
a
week
if
she
could
esther
passed
an
hour
or
two
with
the
children
at
the
hospital
this
building
had
accommodations
for
some
or
thirty
small
patients
and
as
it
was
a
private
affair
the
ladies
managed
it
to
please
themselves
the
children
were
given
all
the
sunlight
that
could
be
got
into
their
rooms
and
all
the
toys
and
playthings
they
could
profitably
destroy
as
the
doctors
said
that
with
most
of
them
amusement
was
all
they
would
ever
get
out
of
life
an
attempt
was
made
to
amuse
them
one
large
room
was
fitted
up
for
the
purpose
and
the
result
was
so
satisfactory
that
esther
got
more
pleasure
out
of
it
than
the
children
did
here
a
crowd
of
little
invalids
playing
on
the
yellow
floor
or
lying
on
couches
were
always
waiting
to
be
amused
and
longing
to
be
noticed
and
thought
themselves
if
at
least
one
of
the
regular
visitors
did
not
appear
every
day
to
hear
of
their
pains
and
pleasures
esther
regular
task
was
to
tell
them
a
story
and
learning
from
experience
that
she
could
double
its
effect
by
illustrating
it
she
was
in
the
custom
of
drawing
as
she
went
on
pictures
of
her
kings
and
queens
fairies
monkeys
and
lions
with
amiable
manners
and
the
best
moral
characters
thus
drawing
as
she
talked
the
story
came
on
but
slowly
and
spread
itself
over
weeks
and
months
of
time
on
this
saturday
afternoon
esther
was
at
her
work
in
the
surrounded
by
a
dozen
or
more
children
with
a
cripple
tortured
by
lying
at
her
side
and
clinging
to
her
skirt
while
a
proud
princess
with
red
and
white
cheeks
and
voluminous
robes
was
making
life
bright
with
colored
crayons
and
more
highly
colored
adventures
when
the
door
opened
and
esther
saw
the
rev
stephen
hazard
with
her
aunt
murray
on
the
threshold
mr
hazard
was
not
to
blame
if
the
scene
before
him
made
a
sudden
and
sharp
picture
on
his
memory
the
autumn
sun
was
coming
in
at
the
windows
the
room
was
warm
and
pleasant
to
look
at
on
a
wide
brick
hearth
logs
of
hickory
and
oak
were
burning
two
tall
iron
sat
up
there
on
their
hind
legs
and
roasted
their
backs
animals
in
which
the
children
were
expected
to
take
living
interest
because
they
had
large
yellow
glass
eyes
through
which
the
fire
sparkled
with
this
a
group
of
small
invalids
whose
faces
and
figures
were
stamped
with
the
marks
of
organic
disease
and
in
the
center
esther
mr
hazard
had
come
here
this
afternoon
partly
because
he
thought
it
his
duty
and
partly
because
he
wanted
to
create
closer
relations
with
a
parishioner
so
likely
to
be
useful
as
murray
he
was
miserable
with
a
cold
and
was
weak
with
fatigue
his
next
sermon
was
turning
out
dull
and
disjointed
his
building
committee
were
interfering
and
quarreling
with
wharton
a
harsh
wind
had
set
his
teeth
on
edge
and
filled
his
eyes
with
dust
rarely
had
he
found
himself
in
a
less
spiritual
frame
of
mind
than
when
he
entered
this
room
the
contrast
was
overwhelming
when
esther
at
first
said
quite
decidedly
that
nothing
would
induce
her
to
go
on
with
her
story
he
felt
at
once
that
this
was
the
only
thing
necessary
to
his
comfort
and
made
so
earnest
an
appeal
that
she
was
forced
to
relent
though
rather
ungraciously
with
a
laughing
notice
that
he
must
listen
very
patiently
to
her
sermon
as
she
had
listened
to
his
the
half
hour
which
he
now
passed
among
kings
and
queens
in
tropical
islands
and
cocoanut
groves
with
giants
and
talking
monkeys
was
one
of
peace
and
pleasure
he
drew
so
good
a
monkey
on
a
cocoanut
tree
that
the
children
shouted
with
delight
and
esther
complained
that
his
competition
would
ruin
her
market
she
rose
at
last
to
go
telling
him
that
she
was
sorry
to
seem
so
harsh
but
had
she
known
that
his
pictures
and
stories
were
so
much
better
than
hers
she
would
never
have
voted
to
make
him
a
visitor
mr
hazard
was
flattered
he
naturally
supposed
that
a
woman
must
have
some
fine
quality
if
she
could
interest
wharton
and
strong
two
men
utterly
different
in
character
and
at
the
same
time
amuse
suffering
children
and
drag
his
own
mind
out
of
its
deepest
discouragement
without
show
of
effort
or
consciousness
of
charm
in
this
atmosphere
of
charity
where
all
faiths
were
alike
and
all
professions
joined
hands
the
church
and
the
world
became
one
and
esther
was
the
best
of
allies
while
to
her
eyes
mr
hazard
seemed
a
man
of
the
world
with
a
talent
for
drawing
and
a
quick
imagination
gentle
with
children
pleasant
with
women
and
fond
of
humor
she
could
not
help
thinking
that
if
he
would
but
tell
pleasant
stories
in
the
pulpit
and
illustrate
them
on
a
celestial
blackboard
such
as
wharton
might
design
church
would
be
an
agreeable
place
to
pass
one
sunday
mornings
in
as
for
him
when
she
went
away
with
her
aunt
he
returned
to
his
solitary
dinner
with
a
mind
diverted
from
its
current
he
finished
his
sermon
without
an
effort
he
felt
a
sort
of
hope
that
esther
would
be
again
a
listener
and
that
he
might
talk
it
over
with
her
the
next
morning
he
looked
about
the
church
and
was
disappointed
at
not
seeing
her
there
this
young
man
was
used
to
flattery
he
had
been
sickened
with
it
especially
by
the
women
of
his
congregation
he
thought
there
was
nothing
of
this
nature
against
which
he
was
not
proof
yet
he
resented
esther
dudley
neglect
to
flatter
him
by
coming
to
his
sermon
her
absence
was
a
hint
that
at
least
one
of
his
congregation
did
not
care
to
hear
him
preach
a
second
time
piqued
at
this
indifference
to
his
eloquence
and
earnestness
he
went
the
next
afternoon
according
to
his
agreement
to
strong
rooms
knowing
that
miss
dudley
was
to
be
there
and
determined
to
win
her
over
the
little
family
party
which
strong
had
got
together
was
intended
more
for
this
purpose
than
for
any
other
and
strong
willing
to
do
what
he
could
to
smooth
his
friend
path
was
glad
to
throw
him
in
contact
with
persons
from
whom
he
could
expect
something
besides
flattery
strong
never
conceived
it
possible
that
hazard
could
influence
them
but
he
thought
their
influence
likely
to
be
serious
upon
hazard
he
underrated
his
friend
force
of
character
his
eyes
were
soon
opened
catherine
brooke
made
her
first
appearance
on
this
occasion
and
was
greatly
excited
at
the
idea
of
knowing
people
as
intellectual
as
mr
hazard
and
wharton
she
thought
them
a
sort
of
princes
and
was
still
ignorant
that
such
princes
were
as
tyrannical
as
any
in
the
almanach
de
gotha
and
that
those
who
submitted
to
them
would
suffer
slavery
her
innocent
eagerness
to
submit
was
charming
and
the
tyrants
gloated
over
the
fresh
and
radiant
victim
who
was
eager
to
be
their
slave
they
lured
her
on
by
assumed
gentleness
in
the
path
of
and
sermons
in
her
want
of
experience
she
appealed
to
strong
who
had
not
the
air
of
being
their
accomplice
but
seemed
to
her
a
rather
ally
of
her
own
strong
had
seated
her
by
the
window
and
was
teaching
her
to
admire
his
collections
while
wharton
and
hazard
were
talking
with
the
rest
of
the
party
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
what
kind
of
an
artist
is
mr
wharton
asked
catherine
a
sort
of
superior
replied
strong
he
sometimes
does
glazing
nonsense
said
catherine
contemptuously
i
know
all
about
him
esther
has
told
me
i
want
to
know
how
good
an
artist
he
is
what
would
they
think
of
him
in
paris
that
would
depend
on
whether
they
owned
any
of
his
pictures
persisted
strong
i
think
he
might
be
worse
but
then
i
have
one
of
his
paintings
and
am
waiting
to
sell
it
when
the
market
price
gets
well
up
do
you
see
it
the
one
over
my
desk
in
the
corner
how
do
you
like
it
why
does
he
make
it
so
dark
and
dismal
asked
catherine
i
ca
make
it
out
that
is
the
charm
he
replied
i
never
could
make
it
out
myself
let
ask
him
and
he
called
across
the
room
wharton
will
you
explain
to
miss
brooke
what
your
picture
is
about
she
wants
to
know
and
you
are
the
only
man
who
can
tell
her
wharton
in
his
grave
way
came
over
to
them
and
first
looking
sadly
at
miss
brooke
then
at
the
picture
said
at
length
as
though
to
himself
i
thought
it
was
good
when
i
did
it
i
think
it
is
pretty
good
now
what
criticism
do
you
make
miss
brooke
catherine
was
in
mortal
terror
but
stood
her
ground
like
a
heroine
i
said
it
seemed
to
me
dark
wharton
and
i
asked
why
you
made
it
so
wharton
looked
again
at
the
picture
and
meditated
over
it
then
he
said
do
you
think
it
would
be
improved
by
being
lighter
although
catherine
pleaded
guilty
to
this
shocking
heresy
she
did
it
with
so
much
innocence
of
manner
that
in
a
few
minutes
wharton
was
captured
by
her
sweet
face
and
tried
to
make
her
understand
his
theory
that
the
merit
of
a
painting
was
not
so
much
in
what
it
explained
as
in
what
it
suggested
comments
from
the
interfered
with
his
success
hazard
especially
perplexed
catherine
struggling
attention
by
making
fun
of
wharton
lecture
your
idea
of
a
picture
said
he
must
seem
to
miss
brooke
like
my
cincinnati
parishioner
idea
of
a
i
was
one
day
admiring
his
field
of
indian
corn
which
stretched
out
into
the
distance
like
lake
erie
in
a
yellow
sunset
when
the
owner
looking
at
his
harvest
as
solemnly
as
wharton
is
looking
at
his
picture
said
that
what
he
liked
most
was
the
hogs
he
could
see
out
of
it
well
said
wharton
the
dutch
made
a
good
school
out
of
men
like
him
art
is
equal
to
any
thing
i
will
paint
his
hogs
for
him
slaughtered
and
hung
up
by
the
hind
legs
and
if
i
know
how
to
paint
i
can
put
his
into
them
like
ostade
and
make
the
butchers
glow
with
emotion
do
believe
him
miss
brooke
said
hazard
he
wants
you
to
do
his
own
work
and
if
you
give
in
to
him
you
are
lost
he
covers
a
canvas
with
paint
and
then
asks
you
to
put
yourself
into
it
he
might
as
well
hold
up
a
to
you
any
man
can
paint
a
beautiful
picture
if
he
could
persuade
miss
brooke
to
see
herself
in
it
what
a
pretty
compliment
said
esther
it
is
more
flattering
than
the
picture
you
can
prove
its
truth
miss
dudley
said
hazard
it
is
easy
to
show
that
i
am
right
paint
miss
brooke
yourself
give
to
her
the
soul
of
the
colorado
plains
show
that
beauty
of
subject
is
the
right
ideal
you
will
annihilate
wharton
and
do
an
immortal
work
hazard
knack
of
fixing
an
influence
wherever
he
went
had
long
been
the
wonder
of
strong
but
had
never
surprised
or
amused
him
more
than
now
when
he
saw
esther
after
a
moment
hesitation
accept
this
idea
and
begin
to
discuss
with
hazard
the
pose
and
surroundings
which
were
to
give
catherine
brooke
picture
the
soul
of
the
colorado
plains
hazard
drew
well
and
had
studied
art
more
carefully
than
most
men
he
used
to
say
that
if
he
had
not
a
special
mission
for
the
church
as
a
matter
of
personal
taste
he
should
have
preferred
the
studio
he
not
only
got
at
once
into
intimate
relations
with
esther
and
catherine
but
he
established
a
sort
of
title
in
esther
proposed
portrait
strong
laughed
to
himself
at
seeing
that
even
dudley
who
disliked
the
clergy
more
than
any
other
form
of
virtue
was
destined
to
fall
a
victim
to
hazard
tact
when
the
clergyman
walked
away
from
strong
rooms
that
afternoon
he
felt
although
even
to
himself
he
would
not
have
confessed
it
a
little
elated
instinct
has
more
to
do
than
vanity
with
such
weaknesses
and
hazard
instinct
told
him
that
his
success
to
be
lasting
depended
largely
on
overcoming
the
indifference
of
people
like
the
dudleys
if
he
could
not
draw
to
himself
and
his
church
the
men
and
women
who
were
strong
enough
to
have
opinions
of
their
own
it
was
small
triumph
to
draw
a
procession
of
followers
from
a
class
who
took
their
opinions
like
their
jewelry
he
felt
that
he
must
get
a
hold
on
the
rebellious
age
and
that
it
would
not
prove
rebellious
to
him
he
meant
that
miss
dudley
should
come
regularly
to
church
and
on
his
success
in
bringing
her
there
he
was
to
stake
the
chances
of
his
mission
in
life
so
catherine
portrait
was
begun
at
once
when
catherine
herself
had
been
barely
a
week
in
new
york
to
please
esther
dudley
had
built
for
her
a
studio
at
the
top
of
his
house
which
she
had
fitted
up
in
the
style
affected
by
painters
filling
it
with
the
regular
supply
of
eastern
stuffs
porcelains
and
even
the
weapons
which
damascus
has
the
credit
of
producing
one
or
two
ivory
carvings
especially
a
small
italian
crucifix
a
lay
figure
some
japanese
screens
and
eastern
rugs
her
studio
differed
little
from
others
unless
that
it
was
cleaner
than
most
and
it
contained
the
usual
array
of
misshapen
sketches
pinned
against
the
wall
and
of
spoiled
canvases
leaning
against
each
other
in
corners
as
though
they
were
wall
flower
beauties
pouting
at
neglect
here
catherine
brooke
was
now
enthroned
as
the
light
of
the
prairie
and
day
after
day
for
three
weeks
esther
labored
over
the
portrait
with
as
much
perseverance
as
though
hazard
were
right
in
promising
that
it
should
make
her
immortal
the
last
days
of
november
and
the
first
of
december
are
the
best
in
the
year
for
work
and
esther
worked
with
an
energy
that
surprised
her
she
wanted
to
extort
praise
from
wharton
and
even
felt
a
slight
shade
of
responsibility
towards
mr
hazard
at
first
no
one
was
to
be
admitted
to
see
it
while
in
progress
then
an
exception
was
made
for
strong
and
hazard
who
came
to
the
house
one
evening
and
in
a
moment
of
expansiveness
were
told
that
they
would
be
admitted
to
the
studio
they
came
and
esther
found
mr
suggestions
so
useful
that
she
could
not
again
shut
him
out
in
return
she
was
shamed
into
going
to
church
with
her
aunt
the
following
sunday
where
she
heard
mr
hazard
preach
again
she
did
not
enjoy
it
and
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
repeat
the
compliment
one
should
not
know
clergymen
she
said
in
excuse
to
her
father
for
not
liking
the
sermon
there
is
no
harm
in
knowing
an
actress
or
but
religion
is
a
serious
thing
mr
hazard
did
not
know
how
mere
a
piece
of
civility
her
attendance
was
he
saw
only
that
she
was
present
that
his
audience
was
larger
and
his
success
more
assured
than
ever
with
this
he
was
well
satisfied
and
as
he
had
been
used
in
life
always
to
have
his
own
way
he
took
it
for
granted
that
in
this
instance
he
had
got
it
the
portrait
of
course
did
not
satisfy
esther
do
what
she
would
catherine
features
and
complexion
defied
modeling
and
made
the
artificial
colors
seem
hard
and
coarse
the
best
she
could
paint
was
not
far
from
failure
she
felt
the
danger
and
called
mr
hazard
to
her
aid
hazard
suggested
alterations
and
insisted
much
on
what
he
was
pleased
to
call
values
which
were
not
the
values
esther
had
given
with
his
help
the
picture
became
respectable
as
pictures
go
although
it
would
not
have
been
with
impunity
that
tintoret
himself
had
tried
to
paint
the
soul
of
the
prairie
esther
like
most
women
was
timid
and
wanted
to
be
told
when
she
could
be
bold
with
perfect
safety
while
hazard
grasp
of
all
subjects
though
feminine
in
appearance
was
masculine
and
persistent
in
reality
to
be
steadily
strong
was
not
in
esther
nature
she
was
audacious
only
by
starts
and
recoiled
from
her
own
audacity
before
long
hazard
began
to
dominate
her
will
she
felt
a
little
uneasy
until
he
had
seen
and
approved
her
work
more
than
once
he
disapproved
and
then
she
had
to
do
it
over
again
she
began
at
length
to
be
conscious
of
this
impalpable
tyranny
and
submitted
to
it
only
because
she
felt
her
own
dependence
and
knew
that
in
a
few
days
more
she
should
be
free
if
he
had
been
clerical
or
dogmatic
she
might
have
resented
it
and
the
charm
would
have
broken
to
pieces
on
the
spot
but
he
was
for
the
time
a
painter
like
herself
as
much
interested
in
the
art
and
caring
for
nothing
else
towards
christmas
the
great
work
was
finished
and
the
same
party
that
had
met
a
month
before
at
strong
rooms
came
together
again
in
esther
studio
to
sit
upon
and
judge
the
portrait
they
had
suggested
dudley
with
some
effort
climbed
up
from
his
library
murray
again
acted
as
chaperon
and
even
murray
whose
fancy
for
pictures
was
his
only
known
weakness
came
to
see
what
esther
had
made
of
catherine
the
portrait
was
placed
in
a
light
that
showed
all
its
best
points
and
concealed
as
far
as
possible
all
its
weak
ones
and
esther
herself
poured
out
tea
for
the
connoisseurs
to
disapprove
in
such
a
company
was
not
easy
but
wharton
was
equal
to
the
task
he
never
compromised
his
convictions
on
such
matters
even
to
please
his
hosts
and
in
consequence
had
given
offense
to
most
of
the
in
the
city
of
new
york
he
showed
little
mercy
now
to
esther
and
perhaps
his
attack
might
have
reduced
her
courage
to
despair
had
she
not
found
a
champion
who
took
her
defense
wholly
on
his
own
shoulders
it
happened
that
wharton
attacked
parts
of
the
treatment
for
which
hazard
was
responsible
and
when
hazard
stepped
into
the
lists
avowing
that
he
had
advised
the
work
and
believed
it
to
be
good
esther
was
able
to
retire
from
the
conflict
and
to
leave
the
two
men
fighting
a
pitched
battle
over
the
principles
of
art
hazard
defended
and
justified
every
portion
of
the
painting
with
a
vigor
and
resource
quite
beyond
esther
means
and
such
as
earned
her
lively
gratitude
when
he
had
reduced
wharton
to
silence
which
was
not
a
difficult
task
for
wharton
was
a
poor
hand
at
dispute
or
argument
and
felt
rather
than
talked
mr
hazard
turned
to
esther
who
gave
him
a
look
of
gratitude
such
as
she
had
rarely
conferred
on
any
of
his
sex
i
think
we
have
ground
him
to
powder
at
last
said
hazard
with
his
boyish
laugh
of
delight
i
never
knew
before
what
it
was
to
have
a
defender
said
she
simply
meanwhile
strong
who
thought
this
battle
no
affair
of
his
was
amusing
himself
as
usual
by
chaffing
catherine
i
have
told
my
colleague
who
professes
languages
said
he
that
i
have
a
young
sioux
in
the
city
and
he
is
making
notes
for
future
conversation
with
you
what
will
he
talk
about
asked
catherine
are
all
professors
as
foolish
as
you
he
will
be
light
and
airy
with
you
he
asked
me
what
gens
you
belonged
to
i
told
him
i
guessed
it
was
the
grouse
gens
he
said
he
had
not
been
aware
that
such
a
totem
existed
among
the
sioux
i
replied
that
so
far
as
i
could
ascertain
you
were
the
only
surviving
member
of
your
family
well
and
what
am
i
to
say
asked
catherine
tell
him
that
the
rocky
mountains
make
it
their
only
business
to
echo
his
name
said
strong
have
you
an
indian
grandmother
no
but
perhaps
i
could
lariat
an
old
aunt
for
him
if
he
will
like
me
better
for
it
aunt
will
do
said
strong
address
the
old
gentleman
in
sioux
and
call
him
the
with
spectacles
it
will
please
his
soft
old
heart
and
he
will
take
off
his
spectacles
and
fall
in
love
with
you
there
is
nothing
so
frivolous
as
learning
nothing
else
knows
enough
i
like
him
already
said
catherine
a
professor
with
spectacles
is
worth
more
than
a
sioux
warrior
i
will
go
with
him
do
be
in
a
hurry
replied
strong
it
will
come
to
about
the
same
thing
in
the
end
my
colleague
will
only
want
your
head
to
dry
and
stuff
for
his
collection
if
i
were
a
girl
again
said
murray
who
was
listening
to
their
conversation
i
would
much
rather
a
man
should
ask
for
my
head
than
my
heart
that
is
what
is
the
matter
with
all
of
you
said
strong
there
are
wharton
and
esther
at
it
again
quarreling
about
catherine
head
every
body
disputes
about
her
head
and
i
am
the
only
one
who
goes
for
her
heart
wharton
is
so
stern
pleaded
esther
in
defense
against
the
charge
of
quarreling
a
hundred
times
he
has
told
me
that
i
ca
draw
he
should
have
made
me
learn
when
he
undertook
to
teach
me
you
might
learn
more
easily
now
if
you
would
be
patient
about
it
said
wharton
you
have
too
much
quickness
and
not
enough
knowledge
i
think
mr
hazard
turns
his
compliments
better
than
you
said
esther
after
one
of
your
speeches
i
have
to
catch
my
breath
and
think
what
it
means
i
mean
that
you
ought
to
be
a
professional
replied
wharton
but
if
i
were
able
to
be
a
professional
do
you
think
i
would
be
an
amateur
asked
esther
no
i
would
decorate
a
church
if
that
is
all
your
ambition
do
it
now
said
wharton
come
and
help
me
to
finish
john
i
have
half
a
dozen
workmen
there
who
are
certainly
not
so
good
as
you
what
will
you
give
me
to
do
asked
she
i
will
engage
you
to
paint
under
my
direction
a
large
female
figure
on
the
transept
wall
there
are
four
vacant
spaces
for
which
i
have
made
only
rough
drawings
and
you
can
try
your
hand
on
whichever
you
prefer
you
shall
be
paid
like
the
other
artists
and
you
will
find
some
other
women
employed
there
to
keep
you
company
let
me
choose
the
subject
said
mr
hazard
i
think
i
have
a
voice
in
the
matter
that
depends
on
your
choice
replied
wharton
it
must
be
cecilia
of
course
said
hazard
and
miss
brooke
must
sit
again
as
model
could
you
not
sit
yourself
as
george
on
the
dragon
asked
strong
i
have
just
received
a
tertiary
dragon
from
the
plains
which
i
should
like
to
see
properly
used
in
the
interests
of
the
church
catherine
is
a
better
model
answered
esther
you
not
yet
seen
my
dragon
let
me
bring
him
round
to
you
with
hazard
on
his
back
he
would
fly
away
with
you
all
into
the
stars
there
are
dragons
enough
at
john
answered
hazard
i
will
ride
on
none
of
them
you
no
sense
of
the
highest
art
said
strong
science
alone
is
truth
you
are
throwing
away
your
last
chance
to
reconcile
science
and
religion
so
after
much
discussion
it
was
at
last
decided
that
esther
dudley
should
begin
work
at
john
as
a
professional
decorator
under
wharton
eye
and
that
her
first
task
should
be
to
paint
a
standing
figure
of
cecilia
some
eight
or
ten
feet
high
on
the
wall
of
the
north
transept
john
church
was
a
pleasant
spot
for
such
work
the
north
transept
high
up
towards
the
vault
of
the
roof
was
still
occupied
by
a
wide
scaffold
which
shut
in
the
painters
and
shut
out
the
curious
and
ran
the
whole
length
of
its
three
sides
being
open
towards
the
body
of
the
church
when
esther
came
to
inspect
her
field
of
labor
she
found
herself
obliged
to
choose
between
a
space
where
her
painting
would
be
conspicuous
from
below
and
one
where
except
in
certain
unusual
lights
it
could
hardly
be
seen
at
all
partly
out
of
delicacy
that
she
might
not
seem
to
crowd
wharton
own
work
into
the
darkness
partly
out
of
pure
diffidence
esther
chose
the
least
conspicuous
space
and
there
a
sort
of
studio
was
railed
off
for
her
breast
high
within
which
she
was
mistress
wharton
when
painting
was
at
this
time
engaged
at
some
distance
but
on
the
same
scaffolding
near
the
nave
the
great
church
was
silent
with
the
echoing
silence
which
is
audible
except
for
a
call
from
workmen
below
to
those
at
work
above
or
for
the
murmur
of
the
painters
as
they
chatted
in
intervals
of
rest
or
for
occasional
hammering
which
echoed
in
hollow
reverberations
no
sound
disturbed
repose
here
one
felt
the
meaning
of
retreat
and
the
dignity
of
silence
which
respected
itself
the
presence
which
was
not
to
be
touched
or
seen
to
a
child
like
catherine
brooke
the
first
effect
was
as
impressive
as
though
she
were
in
the
church
of
mark
she
was
overwhelmed
by
the
space
and
silence
the
color
and
form
and
as
she
came
close
to
wharton
four
great
figures
of
the
evangelists
and
saw
how
coarsely
they
were
painted
and
looked
sheer
down
from
them
upon
the
distant
she
thought
herself
in
an
older
world
and
would
hardly
have
felt
surprised
at
finding
herself
turned
into
an
italian
and
at
seeing
michael
angelo
and
raphael
instead
of
wharton
and
esther
walk
in
at
the
side
door
and
proceed
to
paint
her
in
celestial
grandeur
and
beauty
as
the
new
madonna
of
the
prairie
over
the
high
altar
this
humility
lasted
several
minutes
then
after
glancing
steadfastly
at
wharton
figure
of
john
of
patmos
which
stood
next
to
that
which
esther
was
to
paint
catherine
suddenly
broke
out
shade
of
columbus
you
are
not
going
to
make
me
look
like
that
i
suppose
i
must
replied
esther
mischievously
lean
and
dingy
in
a
faded
brown
blanket
asked
catherine
in
evident
anguish
so
wharton
says
answered
esther
unrelentingly
not
if
i
there
rejoined
catherine
this
time
with
an
air
of
calm
decision
i
no
such
ornery
saint
as
that
henceforth
she
applied
all
her
energies
and
feminine
charms
to
the
task
of
preventing
this
disaster
and
her
first
effort
was
to
make
a
conquest
of
wharton
esther
stood
in
fear
of
the
painter
who
was
apt
to
be
too
earnest
to
measure
his
words
with
great
care
he
praised
little
and
found
fault
much
he
broke
out
in
rage
with
all
work
that
seemed
to
him
weak
or
sentimental
he
required
esther
to
make
her
design
on
the
spot
that
he
might
see
moment
by
moment
what
it
was
coming
to
and
half
a
dozen
times
he
condemned
it
and
obliged
her
to
begin
anew
almost
every
day
occurred
some
scene
of
discouragement
which
made
esther
almost
regret
that
she
had
undertaken
a
task
so
hard
catherine
being
encouraged
by
the
idea
that
esther
was
partly
struggling
for
her
sake
often
undertook
to
join
in
the
battle
and
sometimes
got
roughly
handled
for
her
boldness
why
ca
you
let
her
go
her
own
way
wharton
and
see
what
she
means
to
do
asked
catherine
one
morning
after
a
week
of
unprofitable
labor
because
she
does
not
come
here
to
go
her
own
way
miss
brooke
but
to
go
the
right
way
but
do
you
see
that
she
is
a
woman
and
you
are
trying
to
make
a
man
of
her
an
artist
must
be
man
woman
and
replied
wharton
sternly
you
want
me
to
be
michael
angelo
said
esther
and
i
hate
him
i
do
want
to
draw
as
badly
as
he
did
wharton
gave
a
little
snort
of
wrath
i
want
you
to
be
above
your
subject
whatever
it
is
do
you
see
you
are
trying
to
keep
down
on
a
level
with
it
that
is
not
the
path
to
paradise
put
heaven
in
miss
brooke
eyes
heaven
is
not
there
now
only
earth
she
is
a
flower
if
you
like
you
are
the
real
saint
it
is
your
own
paradise
that
cecilia
is
singing
about
i
want
to
make
cecilia
glow
with
your
soul
not
with
miss
brooke
miss
brooke
has
got
no
soul
yet
neither
have
i
groaned
esther
making
up
a
little
face
at
vehemence
no
said
wharton
seized
with
a
gravity
as
sudden
as
his
outbreak
i
suppose
not
a
soul
is
like
a
bird
and
needs
a
sharp
tap
on
its
shell
to
open
it
never
mind
one
who
has
as
much
feeling
for
art
as
you
have
must
have
soul
some
where
this
sort
of
lecture
might
be
well
enough
for
esther
if
she
had
the
ability
to
profit
by
it
but
catherine
had
no
mind
to
be
thus
treated
as
though
she
were
an
early
christian
she
flushed
at
hearing
herself
coolly
flung
aside
like
common
clay
and
her
exquisite
eyes
half
filled
with
tears
as
she
broke
out
i
believe
you
think
i
a
beetle
because
i
come
from
colorado
why
may
i
not
have
a
soul
as
well
as
you
wharton
started
at
this
burst
of
feeling
he
felt
as
though
he
had
really
cracked
the
of
what
he
called
a
soul
in
the
wrong
person
but
he
was
not
to
be
diverted
from
his
lecture
there
miss
dudley
he
said
look
at
her
now
then
catching
a
crayon
he
continued
wait
let
me
try
it
myself
and
began
rapidly
to
draw
the
girl
features
quite
upset
by
this
unexpected
recoil
of
her
attack
catherine
would
have
liked
to
escape
but
the
painter
when
the
fit
was
on
him
became
very
imperious
and
she
dared
not
oppose
his
will
when
at
length
he
finished
his
sketch
he
had
the
civility
to
beg
her
pardon
this
is
a
man
work
said
esther
studying
his
drawing
no
woman
would
ever
have
done
it
i
do
like
it
i
prefer
her
as
she
is
and
as
i
made
her
wharton
himself
seemed
to
be
not
perfectly
satisfied
with
his
own
success
for
he
made
no
answer
to
esther
criticism
and
after
one
glance
at
his
sketch
relapsed
into
moody
silence
perhaps
he
felt
that
what
he
had
drawn
was
not
a
cecilia
at
all
and
still
less
a
catherine
brooke
he
had
narrowed
the
face
deepened
its
lines
made
the
eyes
much
stronger
and
darker
and
added
at
least
ten
years
to
catherine
age
in
order
to
give
an
expression
of
passion
subsided
and
heaven
attained
you
have
reached
nirvana
said
esther
to
catherine
still
studying
the
sketch
what
is
nirvana
asked
catherine
ask
wharton
he
has
put
you
there
nirvana
is
what
i
mean
by
paradise
replied
wharton
slowly
it
is
eternal
life
which
my
poet
says
consists
in
seeing
god
i
would
not
like
to
look
like
that
said
catherine
in
an
tone
do
you
think
this
picture
will
ever
be
like
me
the
gods
forbid
said
the
painter
uneasily
catherine
who
could
not
take
her
eyes
from
this
revelation
of
the
possible
mysteries
in
her
own
existence
mysteries
which
for
the
first
time
seemed
to
have
come
so
near
as
to
her
face
now
suddenly
turned
to
wharton
and
said
with
irresistible
simplicity
wharton
will
you
let
me
have
it
i
have
no
money
will
you
give
it
to
me
you
could
not
buy
it
i
will
give
it
to
you
on
one
condition
replied
wharton
do
make
it
a
hard
one
you
shall
forget
that
i
said
you
had
no
soul
oh
said
catherine
greatly
relieved
if
i
have
one
you
were
the
first
to
see
it
she
carried
the
sketch
away
with
her
nor
has
any
one
caught
sight
of
it
since
she
rolled
it
up
she
refused
to
show
it
or
talk
of
it
until
even
strong
was
forced
to
drop
the
subject
and
leave
her
to
dream
in
peace
of
the
romance
that
could
give
such
a
light
to
her
eyes
strong
was
one
of
the
few
persons
allowed
to
climb
up
to
their
perch
and
see
their
work
when
he
next
came
esther
told
him
of
wharton
lecture
and
of
catherine
sudden
rebellion
delighted
with
this
new
flight
of
his
prairie
bird
strong
declared
that
as
they
were
all
bent
on
taking
likenesses
of
catherine
he
would
like
to
try
his
own
hand
at
it
and
show
them
how
an
american
saint
ought
to
look
when
seen
by
the
light
of
science
he
then
set
to
work
with
esther
pencils
and
drew
a
portrait
of
catherine
under
the
figure
of
a
large
colorado
beetle
with
wings
extended
when
it
was
done
he
pinned
it
against
the
wall
now
esther
said
he
take
my
advice
no
one
wants
european
saints
over
here
they
are
only
clerical
and
what
little
meaning
they
ever
had
is
not
worth
now
a
tolerable
japanese
teapot
but
here
is
a
national
saint
that
every
one
knows
not
an
american
citizen
can
come
into
your
church
from
salt
lake
city
to
nantucket
who
will
not
say
that
this
is
the
church
for
his
money
he
will
believe
in
your
saints
for
he
knows
them
paint
her
so
very
well
said
catherine
if
wharton
will
consent
i
have
no
objection
wharton
took
it
with
his
usual
seriousness
i
believe
you
are
right
said
he
sadly
i
feel
more
and
more
that
our
work
is
thrown
away
if
hazard
and
the
committee
will
consent
miss
dudley
shall
paint
what
she
likes
for
all
me
no
one
dared
carry
die
joke
so
far
as
to
ask
mr
hazard
consent
to
canonize
this
american
saint
and
strong
after
finishing
his
sketch
and
labelling
it
catarina
colorado
gave
it
to
catherine
as
a
companion
to
wharton
for
some
time
she
was
called
the
beetle
wharton
conscience
seemed
to
smite
him
for
his
rudeness
and
catherine
was
promoted
to
the
position
of
favorite
while
esther
toiled
over
the
tiresome
draperies
of
her
picture
catherine
would
wander
off
with
wharton
on
his
tours
of
inspection
she
listened
to
all
the
discussions
and
picked
up
the
meaning
of
his
orders
and
criticisms
in
a
short
time
she
began
to
maintain
opinions
of
her
own
wharton
liked
to
have
her
near
him
and
came
to
get
her
when
she
failed
to
appear
at
his
rounds
they
became
confidential
and
sympathetic
are
you
never
homesick
for
your
prairie
he
asked
one
day
not
a
bit
she
answered
i
like
the
east
what
is
the
use
of
having
a
world
to
one
self
what
is
the
use
of
any
thing
asked
wharton
i
give
it
up
she
replied
does
art
say
that
a
woman
is
no
use
i
know
of
nothing
useful
in
life
said
he
except
what
is
beautiful
or
creates
beauty
you
are
beautiful
and
ought
to
be
most
so
on
your
prairie
am
i
really
beautiful
asked
catherine
with
much
animation
no
one
ever
told
me
so
before
this
was
coquetry
the
young
person
had
often
heard
of
the
fact
and
even
had
she
not
her
glass
told
her
of
it
several
times
a
day
she
meant
only
that
this
was
the
first
time
the
fact
came
home
to
her
as
a
new
and
exquisite
sensation
you
have
the
charm
of
the
colorado
hills
and
plains
said
he
but
you
wo
keep
it
here
you
will
become
and
is
worse
than
ugliness
nonsense
said
catherine
boldly
i
know
more
art
than
you
if
that
is
your
notion
do
you
suppose
girls
are
so
savage
in
denver
as
not
to
know
when
they
are
pretty
why
the
birds
are
so
are
horses
so
are
antelopes
i
have
seen
them
often
showing
off
their
beauties
like
new
york
women
and
they
are
never
so
pretty
as
then
do
try
it
said
he
if
you
do
i
shall
warn
you
tell
me
do
you
think
my
figure
of
paul
here
i
lie
awake
nights
for
fear
i
have
made
him
so
catherine
looked
long
at
the
figure
and
then
shook
her
head
i
could
tell
you
if
it
were
a
woman
she
said
all
women
are
more
or
less
alike
but
men
are
quite
different
and
even
the
silly
ones
may
have
brains
somewhere
how
can
i
tell
a
grain
of
would
spoil
him
said
wharton
then
men
must
be
very
different
from
women
she
replied
i
will
give
you
leave
to
paint
me
on
every
square
inch
of
the
church
walls
and
roof
and
defy
you
to
spoil
any
charm
you
think
i
have
if
you
will
only
not
make
me
awkward
or
silly
and
you
may
make
me
as
as
esther
cecilia
there
only
she
calls
it
modesty
catherine
was
so
pulled
about
and
put
to
such
practical
uses
in
art
as
to
learn
something
by
her
own
weary
labors
a
quick
girl
soon
picks
up
ideas
when
she
hears
clever
men
talking
about
matters
which
they
understand
esther
began
to
feel
a
little
nervous
catherine
took
so
kindly
to
every
thing
romantic
that
wharton
began
to
get
power
over
her
he
had
a
queer
imagination
of
his
own
which
she
could
not
understand
but
which
had
a
sort
of
fascination
for
her
she
ran
errands
for
him
and
became
a
sort
of
celestial
messenger
about
the
church
as
for
wharton
he
declared
that
she
stood
nearer
nature
than
any
woman
he
knew
and
she
was
in
sympathy
with
his
highest
emotions
he
let
her
ask
innumerable
questions
which
he
answered
or
not
as
happened
to
suit
his
mood
he
paid
no
attention
to
esther
remonstrances
at
being
deprived
of
her
model
but
whenever
he
wanted
catherine
for
any
purpose
he
sent
for
her
and
left
esther
to
her
own
resources
catherine
had
her
own
reasons
for
being
docile
and
for
keeping
him
in
good
humor
she
started
with
the
idea
that
she
did
not
intend
to
be
painted
if
she
could
help
it
as
a
first
century
ascetic
without
color
and
clothed
in
a
wrapper
and
having
once
begun
the
attempt
to
carry
her
own
object
she
was
drawn
on
without
the
power
to
stop
her
intimacy
with
wharton
began
to
make
esther
uneasy
so
that
one
day
when
strong
came
up
and
missing
catherine
asked
what
had
become
of
her
she
consulted
him
on
the
subject
catherine
has
gone
off
with
wharton
to
inspect
she
said
he
comes
for
her
or
sends
for
her
every
day
what
can
i
do
about
it
where
is
the
harm
asked
strong
if
she
likes
to
pass
an
hour
or
two
doing
that
sort
of
thing
i
should
think
it
was
good
for
her
but
suppose
she
takes
a
fancy
to
him
oh
no
woman
could
marry
wharton
said
strong
he
would
forget
her
too
often
and
she
would
lose
patience
with
him
before
he
thought
of
her
again
give
her
her
head
he
will
teach
her
more
that
is
worth
her
knowing
than
she
would
learn
in
a
in
aunt
sarah
parlor
i
wish
i
could
give
her
something
else
to
amuse
her
well
replied
strong
we
will
invent
something
catherine
returned
a
few
minutes
later
and
he
asked
her
how
she
got
on
with
the
and
whether
he
had
yet
recovered
her
favor
since
the
beetle
turned
on
him
said
catherine
we
have
got
on
like
two
little
blind
mice
he
has
been
as
kind
to
me
as
though
i
were
his
mother
but
why
is
he
so
mysterious
he
will
not
tell
me
his
history
he
is
the
same
to
us
all
said
strong
some
people
think
he
is
ashamed
of
his
origin
he
was
picked
out
of
the
gutters
of
cincinnati
by
some
philanthropist
and
sent
abroad
for
an
education
the
fact
is
that
he
cares
no
more
about
his
origin
than
you
do
for
being
a
sioux
indian
but
he
had
the
misfortune
to
marry
badly
in
europe
and
hates
to
talk
of
it
then
he
has
a
wife
already
when
he
is
breaking
my
young
heart
exclaimed
catherine
i
would
like
to
calm
your
fears
my
poor
child
said
strong
but
the
truth
is
that
no
one
knows
what
has
become
of
his
wife
she
may
be
alive
and
she
may
be
dead
do
you
want
me
to
find
out
i
am
dying
to
know
said
catherine
but
i
will
make
him
tell
me
all
about
it
one
of
these
days
never
replied
strong
he
lives
only
in
his
art
since
the
collapse
of
his
marriage
he
eats
and
drinks
paint
does
he
really
paint
so
very
well
asked
catherine
thoughtfully
is
he
a
great
genius
young
woman
we
are
all
of
us
great
geniuses
we
never
say
so
because
we
are
as
modest
as
we
are
great
but
just
look
into
my
book
on
fossil
batrachians
i
do
feel
the
least
interest
in
you
or
your
batrachiums
but
i
adore
mr
wharton
what
is
the
good
of
your
adoring
wharton
asked
the
professor
short
very
good
as
far
as
he
goes
but
the
real
friend
is
codlin
not
short
i
shall
hate
you
if
you
always
make
fun
of
me
what
do
you
mean
by
your
codlins
and
shorts
did
you
never
read
dickens
cried
strong
i
never
read
a
novel
in
my
life
if
that
is
what
you
are
talking
about
answered
catherine
ho
cousin
esther
the
sioux
do
read
dickens
you
should
join
the
tribe
i
always
told
you
that
sensible
people
never
read
said
esther
hard
at
work
on
her
painting
do
you
suppose
cecilia
ever
read
dickens
or
would
have
liked
him
if
she
had
perhaps
not
said
strong
i
take
very
little
stock
in
saints
and
she
strikes
me
as
a
little
of
a
humbug
your
cecilia
but
i
would
like
to
know
what
the
effect
of
the
curiosity
shop
would
be
on
a
indian
squaw
catherine
will
you
try
to
read
it
if
i
bring
you
a
copy
here
may
i
asked
catherine
you
know
i
was
taught
to
believe
that
novels
are
sinful
strong
stared
at
her
a
moment
with
surprise
that
any
new
trait
in
her
could
surprise
him
and
then
went
on
solemnly
angel
you
are
many
points
too
good
for
this
wicked
city
if
you
remain
here
unperverted
you
will
injure
our
trade
i
must
see
to
it
that
your
moral
tone
is
lowered
will
you
read
a
novel
of
this
person
named
dickens
if
mr
hazard
will
permit
you
to
do
so
in
his
church
if
mr
hazard
says
i
must
i
shall
do
so
with
pleasure
replied
catherine
with
her
best
company
manners
and
the
reverend
mr
hazard
having
been
taken
into
esther
confidence
on
the
subject
decided
after
reflection
that
miss
brooke
moral
nature
would
not
be
hurt
by
reading
dickens
under
such
circumstances
so
the
next
day
catherine
was
plunged
into
a
new
world
of
imagination
which
so
absorbed
her
thoughts
that
for
the
time
wharton
himself
seemed
high
on
her
scaffolding
which
looked
sheer
down
into
the
empty
echoing
church
with
huge
saints
and
evangelists
staring
at
her
from
every
side
and
martyrs
admiring
each
other
beatitude
catherine
who
was
already
half
inclined
to
think
life
unreal
fell
into
a
dream
within
a
dream
and
wondered
which
was
untrue
esther
anxiety
about
catherine
was
for
the
time
put
at
rest
by
the
professor
little
maneuver
but
she
had
some
rather
more
serious
cause
for
disquiet
about
herself
in
regard
to
which
she
did
not
care
to
consult
her
cousin
or
any
one
else
wharton
and
strong
were
not
the
only
men
who
undertook
to
enliven
her
path
of
professional
labor
every
day
at
noon
the
reverend
stephen
hazard
visited
his
church
to
see
how
wharton
was
coming
forward
and
this
clerical
duty
was
not
neglected
after
esther
joined
the
much
as
mr
hazard
had
to
do
and
few
men
in
new
york
were
busier
he
never
forgot
to
look
in
for
a
moment
on
the
artists
and
esther
could
not
help
noticing
that
this
moment
tended
to
lengthen
he
had
a
way
of
joining
wharton
and
catherine
on
their
tour
of
inspection
and
then
bringing
catherine
back
to
and
sitting
down
for
an
instant
to
rest
and
look
at
the
cecilia
time
passed
rapidly
and
once
or
twice
it
had
come
over
esther
mind
that
for
a
very
busy
man
mr
hazard
seemed
to
waste
a
great
deal
of
time
it
grew
to
be
a
regular
habit
that
between
noon
and
one
esther
and
catherine
entertained
the
clergyman
of
the
parish
the
strain
of
standing
in
a
pulpit
is
great
no
human
being
ever
yet
constructed
was
strong
enough
to
offer
himself
long
as
a
light
to
humanity
without
showing
the
effect
on
his
constitution
buddhist
saints
stand
for
years
silent
on
one
leg
or
with
arms
raised
above
their
heads
but
the
limbs
shrivel
and
the
mind
shrivels
with
the
limbs
christian
saints
have
found
it
necessary
from
time
to
time
to
drop
their
arms
and
to
walk
on
their
legs
but
they
do
it
with
a
sort
of
apology
or
defiance
and
sometimes
do
it
if
they
can
by
stealth
one
is
a
saint
or
one
is
not
every
man
can
choose
the
career
that
suits
him
but
to
be
saint
and
sinner
at
the
same
time
requires
singular
ingenuity
for
this
reason
wise
clergymen
whose
tastes
though
in
themselves
innocent
may
give
scandal
to
others
enjoy
their
relaxation
so
far
as
they
can
in
privacy
mr
hazard
liked
the
society
of
clever
men
and
agreeable
women
he
was
bound
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
progress
of
his
own
church
he
stepped
not
an
inch
outside
the
range
of
his
clerical
duty
and
privilege
yet
persons
and
there
were
such
in
his
parish
might
say
that
he
was
carrying
on
a
secular
flirtation
in
his
own
church
under
the
pretense
of
doing
his
duty
perhaps
he
felt
the
risk
of
running
into
this
peril
he
invited
no
public
attention
to
the
manner
in
which
he
passed
this
part
of
his
time
and
never
alluded
to
the
subject
in
other
company
to
make
his
incessant
attention
still
more
necessary
it
happened
that
hazard
knowledge
and
his
library
were
often
drawn
upon
by
wharton
and
his
workmen
not
only
was
he
learned
in
all
matters
which
pertained
to
church
arrangement
and
decoration
but
his
collection
of
books
on
the
subject
was
the
best
in
new
york
and
his
library
touched
the
church
wall
wharton
had
a
quantity
of
his
books
in
constant
use
and
was
incessantly
sending
to
consult
about
points
of
doubt
hazard
was
bent
upon
having
every
thing
correct
and
complained
sadly
when
he
found
that
his
wishes
were
not
regarded
he
lectured
wharton
on
the
subject
of
early
christian
art
until
he
saw
that
wharton
would
no
longer
listen
and
then
he
went
off
to
miss
dudley
and
lectured
her
esther
was
not
a
good
subject
for
instruction
of
this
sort
she
cared
little
for
what
the
early
christians
believed
either
in
religion
or
art
and
she
remembered
nothing
at
all
of
his
deep
instruction
on
the
inferences
to
be
drawn
from
the
contents
of
crypts
and
catacombs
the
more
earnest
he
became
the
less
could
she
make
out
his
meaning
she
could
not
reconcile
herself
to
draw
the
attenuated
figures
and
haggard
forms
of
the
early
martyrs
merely
because
they
suited
the
style
of
church
decoration
and
she
could
see
no
striking
harmony
of
relation
between
these
beings
and
the
fifth
avenue
audience
to
whom
they
were
supposed
to
have
some
moral
or
sentimental
meaning
after
one
or
two
hesitating
attempts
to
argue
this
point
she
saw
that
it
was
useless
and
made
up
her
mind
that
as
a
matter
of
ordinary
good
manners
the
least
she
could
do
was
to
treat
mr
hazard
civilly
in
his
own
church
and
listen
with
respect
to
his
lectures
on
christian
art
she
even
did
her
best
to
obey
his
wishes
in
all
respects
in
which
she
understood
them
but
here
an
unexpected
and
confusing
play
of
came
in
to
mislead
her
wharton
suddenly
found
that
hazard
let
miss
dudley
have
her
own
way
to
an
extent
permitted
to
no
one
else
esther
was
not
conscious
that
the
expression
of
a
feeling
or
a
wish
on
her
part
carried
any
special
weight
but
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
if
miss
dudley
seemed
to
want
any
thing
very
much
mr
hazard
showed
no
sense
of
shame
in
suddenly
forgetting
his
fixed
theories
and
encouraging
her
to
do
what
she
pleased
this
point
was
settled
when
she
had
been
some
ten
days
at
work
trying
to
satisfy
wharton
demands
which
were
also
mr
hazard
in
regard
to
the
character
and
expression
of
cecilia
catherine
was
so
earnest
not
to
be
made
repulsive
and
esther
own
tastes
lay
so
strongly
in
the
same
direction
that
when
it
came
to
the
point
she
could
not
force
herself
to
draw
such
a
figure
as
was
required
she
held
out
with
a
sort
of
feminine
sweetness
such
as
cried
aloud
for
discipline
and
there
was
no
doubt
that
wharton
was
quite
ready
to
inflict
it
in
spite
of
catherine
and
esther
too
he
would
have
carried
his
point
had
esther
not
appealed
to
mr
hazard
but
this
strenuous
purist
who
had
worried
wharton
and
the
building
committee
with
daily
complaints
that
the
character
of
their
work
wanted
spiritual
earnestness
now
suddenly
at
a
word
from
miss
dudley
turned
about
and
encouraged
her
against
wharton
orders
to
paint
a
figure
which
if
it
could
be
seen
which
was
fortunately
not
the
case
must
seem
to
any
one
who
cared
for
such
matters
out
of
keeping
with
all
the
work
which
surrounded
it
do
you
know
said
esther
to
mr
hazard
that
wharton
insists
on
my
painting
catherine
as
though
she
were
forty
years
old
and
rheumatic
i
know
he
replied
glancing
timidly
towards
the
procession
of
stern
and
elderly
saints
and
martyrs
finished
and
unfinished
which
seemed
to
bear
up
the
church
walls
do
you
think
she
would
feel
at
home
here
if
she
were
younger
or
prettier
no
honestly
i
do
think
she
would
said
esther
becoming
bold
as
he
became
timid
i
will
paint
cecilia
eighty
years
old
if
wharton
wants
her
so
she
will
have
lost
her
touch
on
the
piano
and
her
voice
will
be
cracked
but
if
you
choose
to
set
such
an
example
to
your
choir
i
will
obey
but
i
ca
ask
catherine
to
sit
for
such
a
figure
i
will
send
out
for
some
old
woman
and
draw
from
her
i
ca
spare
miss
brooke
said
hazard
hastily
the
church
needs
her
perhaps
you
can
find
some
middle
way
with
wharton
no
if
i
am
to
paint
her
at
all
i
must
paint
her
as
she
is
there
is
more
that
is
angelic
in
her
face
now
if
i
could
only
catch
it
than
there
is
in
all
wharton
figures
put
together
and
if
i
am
to
commit
sacrilege
i
would
rather
be
untrue
to
wharton
than
to
her
i
believe
you
are
right
miss
dudley
there
a
little
look
of
heaven
in
miss
brooke
eyes
if
you
think
you
can
put
it
into
the
cecilia
why
not
try
if
the
experiment
fails
you
can
try
again
on
another
plan
after
all
the
drapery
is
the
only
part
that
needs
to
be
very
strictly
in
keeping
thus
this
despotic
clergyman
gave
way
and
irritated
wharton
who
having
promised
to
let
him
decide
the
dispute
was
now
suddenly
overruled
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
told
esther
in
private
that
he
had
struggled
hard
to
get
permission
to
do
what
she
was
doing
but
only
the
sternest
strongest
types
would
satisfy
the
church
then
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
get
them
down
to
the
thirteenth
century
he
said
whenever
i
begged
for
beauty
of
form
they
asked
me
whether
i
wanted
the
place
to
look
like
a
theater
you
know
they
quite
right
said
esther
it
has
a
terribly
grotesque
air
of
theater
even
now
it
a
theater
growled
wharton
that
is
what
ails
our
religion
but
it
is
not
the
fault
of
our
art
and
if
you
had
come
here
a
little
earlier
i
would
have
made
one
more
attempt
i
would
like
now
even
as
it
is
to
go
back
to
the
age
of
beauty
and
put
a
madonna
in
the
heart
of
their
church
the
place
has
no
heart
i
never
could
have
given
you
help
enough
for
that
wharton
but
what
does
it
matter
about
my
poor
cecilia
she
does
no
harm
up
here
no
one
can
see
her
and
after
all
it
is
only
her
features
that
are
modern
no
harm
at
all
but
i
wish
i
were
a
woman
like
you
perhaps
i
could
have
my
own
way
esther
liked
to
have
her
own
way
she
had
the
instinct
of
power
but
not
the
love
of
responsibility
and
now
that
she
found
herself
allowed
to
violate
wharton
orders
and
derange
his
plans
she
became
alarmed
asked
no
more
favors
stuck
closely
to
her
work
and
kept
catherine
always
at
her
side
she
even
tried
to
return
on
her
steps
and
follow
wharton
wishes
until
she
was
stopped
by
catherine
outcry
then
it
appeared
that
wharton
had
gone
over
to
her
side
instead
of
supporting
esther
in
giving
severity
to
the
figure
he
wanted
it
to
be
the
closest
possible
likeness
of
catherine
herself
esther
began
to
think
that
men
were
excessively
queer
and
variable
the
more
she
tried
to
please
them
the
less
she
seemed
to
succeed
but
wharton
certainly
took
more
interest
in
the
cecilia
as
it
advanced
towards
completion
although
it
was
not
in
the
least
the
kind
of
work
which
he
liked
or
respected
mr
hazard
took
not
so
much
interest
in
the
painting
his
pleasure
in
visiting
their
gallery
seemed
to
be
of
a
different
sort
as
esther
learned
to
know
him
better
she
found
that
he
was
suffering
from
and
responsibility
and
that
the
painters
gallery
was
a
sort
of
refuge
where
he
escaped
from
care
for
an
entire
change
of
atmosphere
and
thought
in
this
light
esther
found
him
a
very
charming
fellow
especially
when
he
was
allowed
to
have
his
own
way
without
question
or
argument
he
talked
well
drew
well
wrote
well
and
in
case
of
necessity
could
even
sing
fairly
well
he
had
traveled
far
and
wide
and
had
known
many
interesting
people
he
had
a
sense
of
humor
except
where
his
church
was
concerned
he
was
well
read
especially
in
a
kind
of
literature
of
which
esther
had
heard
nothing
the
devotional
writings
of
the
church
and
the
poetry
of
religious
expression
esther
liked
to
pick
out
plums
of
poetry
without
having
to
search
for
them
on
her
own
account
and
as
hazard
liked
to
talk
even
better
than
she
to
listen
they
babbled
on
pleasantly
together
while
catherine
read
novels
which
hazard
chose
for
her
and
which
he
selected
with
the
idea
of
carrying
her
into
the
life
of
the
past
there
was
an
atmosphere
of
romance
about
her
novels
and
not
about
the
novels
alone
while
this
ecclesiastical
idyl
was
painting
and
singing
itself
in
its
own
way
blind
and
deaf
to
the
realities
of
life
this
life
moved
on
in
its
accustomed
course
undisturbed
by
idyls
the
morning
task
was
always
finished
at
one
at
that
hour
if
the
weather
was
fine
dudley
commonly
stopped
at
the
church
door
to
take
them
away
and
the
rest
of
the
day
was
given
up
to
society
esther
and
catherine
drove
made
calls
dined
out
went
to
balls
to
the
theater
and
opera
without
interrupting
their
professional
work
under
murray
potent
influence
catherine
glided
easily
into
the
current
of
society
and
became
popular
without
an
effort
she
soon
had
admirers
one
young
man
of
an
excellent
and
very
old
dutch
family
rip
van
dam
took
a
marked
fancy
for
her
van
dam
knew
nothing
of
her
except
that
she
was
very
pretty
and
came
from
colorado
where
she
had
been
brought
up
to
like
horses
and
could
ride
almost
any
thing
that
would
not
buck
its
saddle
off
this
was
quite
enough
for
van
dam
whose
taste
for
horses
was
more
decided
than
for
literature
or
art
he
took
catherine
to
drive
when
the
sleighing
was
good
and
was
flattered
by
her
enthusiastic
admiration
of
his
beautiful
pair
of
fast
trotters
his
confidence
in
her
became
boundless
when
he
found
that
she
could
drive
them
quite
as
well
as
he
his
success
in
winning
her
affections
would
have
been
greater
if
catherine
had
not
found
his
charms
incessantly
counteracted
by
the
society
of
the
older
and
more
intelligent
men
whom
she
never
met
at
balls
but
whom
she
saw
every
morning
at
the
church
and
whose
tastes
and
talk
struck
her
imagination
she
liked
van
dam
but
she
laughed
at
him
which
proved
a
thoughtless
mind
for
neither
artists
clergymen
nor
professors
were
likely
to
marry
her
as
this
young
man
might
perhaps
have
done
under
sufficient
encouragement
when
towards
the
first
of
january
catherine
left
murray
in
order
to
stay
with
esther
for
greater
convenience
in
the
church
work
van
dam
attentions
rather
fell
off
he
was
afraid
of
esther
whom
he
insisted
on
regarding
as
clever
although
esther
took
much
care
never
to
laugh
at
him
for
fear
of
doing
mischief
catherine
learned
to
play
whist
in
order
to
amuse
dudley
they
had
small
dinners
at
which
hazard
was
sometimes
present
and
more
often
strong
until
he
was
obliged
to
go
west
to
deliver
a
course
of
lectures
at
louis
in
spite
of
dudley
supposed
dislike
for
clergymen
he
took
kindly
to
hazard
and
made
no
objection
to
his
becoming
a
tame
cat
about
the
house
to
make
up
a
table
at
whist
hazard
did
not
refuse
to
take
a
hand
and
said
it
was
a
part
of
his
parochial
duty
dudley
laughed
and
told
him
that
if
he
performed
the
rest
of
his
parochial
duties
equally
ill
the
parish
should
give
him
a
year
leave
of
absence
for
purposes
of
study
dudley
disliked
nothing
so
much
as
to
be
treated
like
an
invalid
or
to
be
serious
and
hazard
gratified
him
by
laughing
at
the
doctors
they
got
on
wonderfully
well
together
to
the
increasing
amazement
of
esther
and
were
not
the
only
cases
in
which
mr
hazard
took
a
liberal
view
of
his
functions
his
theology
belonged
to
the
school
and
in
the
pulpit
he
made
no
compromise
with
the
spirit
of
concession
but
in
all
ordinary
matters
of
indifference
or
of
innocent
pleasure
he
gave
the
rein
to
his
instincts
and
in
regard
to
art
he
was
so
full
of
its
relations
with
religion
that
he
would
admit
of
no
divergence
between
the
two
art
and
religion
might
take
great
liberties
with
each
other
and
both
be
the
better
for
it
as
he
thought
his
ideas
led
him
into
a
curious
experiment
which
was
quite
in
the
spirit
catherine
insatiable
spirit
of
coquetry
was
to
blame
although
it
was
not
with
him
that
she
coquetted
ready
enough
to
try
her
youthful
powers
on
most
men
she
had
seemed
to
recognize
by
instinct
that
mr
hazard
did
not
belong
to
her
yet
she
could
not
rest
satisfied
without
putting
even
him
to
some
useful
purpose
of
her
own
during
hazard
visits
to
the
scaffold
he
sometimes
took
up
a
pencil
and
drew
once
he
drew
a
sketch
of
wharton
in
the
character
of
a
monk
with
his
brush
and
pallet
in
his
hands
catherine
asked
what
connection
there
was
between
wharton
and
a
monastery
none
replied
mr
hazard
but
i
like
to
think
of
church
work
as
done
by
churchmen
in
the
old
days
he
would
have
been
a
monk
and
would
have
painted
himself
among
these
figures
on
the
walls
esther
ventured
to
criticise
wharton
style
she
thought
it
severe
monotonous
and
sometimes
strained
wharton
real
notion
of
art
said
hazard
is
a
volcano
you
may
be
a
volcano
at
rest
or
extinct
or
in
full
eruption
but
a
volcano
of
some
kind
you
have
got
to
be
in
one
of
his
violent
moods
he
once
made
me
go
over
to
sicily
with
him
and
dragged
me
to
the
top
of
etna
it
fascinated
him
and
i
thought
he
meant
to
jump
into
it
and
pull
me
after
him
but
at
that
time
he
was
a
sort
of
volcano
himself
then
there
is
really
something
mysterious
about
his
life
asked
catherine
only
that
he
made
a
very
unhappy
marriage
which
he
dislikes
to
think
about
replied
hazard
as
an
artist
it
did
him
good
but
it
ruined
his
peace
and
comfort
if
he
ever
had
any
he
would
never
have
made
the
mistake
if
he
had
not
been
more
ignorant
of
the
world
than
any
mortal
that
ever
drew
breath
but
as
i
was
saying
a
volcano
was
like
a
rattlesnake
to
him
and
the
woman
he
married
was
a
volcano
what
has
become
of
her
asked
esther
i
have
not
dared
to
ask
for
years
no
one
seems
to
know
whether
she
is
living
or
dead
did
he
leave
her
no
she
left
him
he
was
to
the
last
fascinated
by
her
so
much
so
that
after
she
left
him
when
i
persuaded
him
to
quit
paris
he
insisted
on
going
to
avignon
and
vaucluse
because
petrarch
had
been
under
the
same
sort
of
fascination
and
wharton
thought
himself
the
only
man
in
the
world
who
could
understand
petrarch
if
you
want
to
insult
him
and
make
him
bitterly
hate
you
tell
him
that
laura
was
a
married
woman
with
a
dozen
children
who
was
laura
asked
catherine
and
why
should
she
not
have
a
dozen
children
laura
was
a
beautiful
girl
with
golden
hair
and
a
green
dress
whom
petrarch
first
saw
in
a
church
at
avignon
answered
hazard
she
was
painted
among
the
frescoes
of
the
cathedral
as
you
are
being
painted
now
miss
brooke
and
petrarch
wrote
some
hundreds
of
sonnets
about
her
which
wharton
undertook
to
translate
and
made
me
help
him
we
were
both
poets
then
i
want
to
hear
those
sonnets
said
catherine
quite
seriously
as
though
the
likeness
between
herself
and
laura
had
struck
her
as
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
can
you
remember
them
i
think
i
could
do
find
fault
with
me
if
you
dislike
the
moral
i
approve
it
because
like
petrarch
i
am
a
bit
of
a
churchman
but
i
do
know
what
you
may
think
of
a
lover
who
begins
by
putting
his
mistress
on
the
same
footing
with
his
deity
and
ends
by
groaning
over
the
time
he
has
thrown
away
on
her
not
to
her
face
said
esther
worse
he
saw
her
in
church
and
wrote
to
her
face
something
like
this
sight
of
god
is
the
eternal
life
nor
more
we
ask
nor
more
to
wish
we
dare
so
lady
sight
of
thee
and
so
on
or
words
to
that
effect
yet
after
she
was
dead
he
said
he
had
wasted
his
life
in
loving
her
i
remember
the
whole
of
the
sonnet
because
it
cost
me
two
days
labor
in
the
railway
between
avignon
and
nice
it
runs
like
this
my
lost
life
lamenting
now
i
go
which
i
have
placed
in
loving
mortal
thing
soaring
to
no
high
flight
although
the
wing
had
strength
to
rise
and
loftier
sweep
to
show
oh
thou
that
seest
my
mean
life
and
low
invisible
immortal
heaven
king
to
this
weak
pathless
spirit
succor
bring
and
on
its
earthly
faults
thy
grace
bestow
that
i
who
lived
in
tempest
and
in
fear
may
die
in
port
and
peace
and
if
it
be
that
life
was
vain
at
least
let
death
be
dear
in
these
few
days
that
yet
remain
to
me
and
in
death
terrors
may
thy
hand
be
near
thou
knowest
that
i
have
no
hope
but
thee
in
the
italian
this
is
very
great
poetry
miss
brooke
and
if
you
think
it
so
in
my
english
try
and
see
if
you
can
do
better
very
well
said
catherine
coolly
i
no
doubt
we
can
do
it
just
as
well
as
you
and
wharton
ca
we
esther
you
are
impudent
enough
to
make
cecilia
blush
said
esther
who
happened
to
be
wondering
whether
she
might
dare
to
put
a
little
blush
into
the
cheeks
of
the
figure
on
which
she
was
painting
you
never
read
a
word
of
italian
in
your
little
life
no
but
you
have
replied
catherine
as
though
this
were
final
the
libretto
of
lucia
said
esther
with
scorn
no
matter
resumed
catherine
bring
me
the
books
mr
hazard
and
i
will
translate
one
of
those
sonnets
if
i
have
to
shut
up
esther
in
a
dark
closet
catherine
do
make
me
ridiculous
said
esther
but
catherine
was
inspired
by
an
idea
and
would
not
be
stopped
bring
me
the
volume
now
mr
hazard
you
shall
have
your
sonnet
for
sunday
sermon
do
do
it
mr
hazard
exhorted
esther
solemnly
it
is
one
of
her
colorado
jokes
she
does
not
know
what
a
sonnet
is
she
thinks
it
some
kind
of
if
i
do
not
give
you
that
sonnet
cried
catherine
i
will
give
you
leave
to
have
me
painted
as
much
like
an
old
skeleton
as
wharton
chooses
done
said
hazard
who
regarded
this
as
at
least
one
point
worth
gaining
you
shall
have
the
books
i
want
to
see
wharton
triumph
but
if
i
do
poetry
for
you
continued
catherine
you
must
do
painting
for
me
very
well
said
hazard
what
shall
it
be
if
i
am
laura
said
catherine
i
must
have
a
petrarch
i
want
you
to
put
him
up
here
on
the
wall
looking
at
me
as
he
did
in
the
church
where
he
first
saw
me
but
what
will
wharton
and
the
committee
say
replied
hazard
startled
at
so
monstrous
a
demand
i
do
believe
wharton
will
object
answered
catherine
he
will
be
flattered
do
you
see
he
is
to
be
petrarch
oh
cried
hazard
with
a
stare
now
i
understand
you
want
me
to
paint
wharton
as
a
scriptural
character
looking
across
to
miss
cecilia
you
are
very
slow
said
catherine
i
think
you
might
have
seen
it
without
making
me
tell
you
to
a
evangelical
parson
this
idea
might
have
seemed
inexpressibly
shocking
but
there
was
something
in
it
which
after
a
moment
reflection
rather
pleased
hazard
it
was
the
sort
of
thing
which
the
florentines
did
and
there
was
hardly
an
early
church
in
italy
about
whose
walls
did
not
cling
the
colors
of
some
such
old
union
of
art
and
friendship
in
the
service
of
religion
catherine
figure
was
already
there
why
not
place
wharton
by
its
side
and
honor
the
artist
who
had
devoted
so
large
a
share
of
his
life
to
the
service
of
the
church
with
it
must
be
confessed
a
very
moderate
share
of
worldly
profit
the
longer
hazard
thought
of
it
the
less
he
saw
to
oppose
his
tastes
were
flattered
by
the
idea
of
doing
something
with
his
own
hand
that
should
add
to
the
character
and
meaning
of
the
building
his
imagination
was
so
pleased
with
the
notion
that
at
last
he
gave
his
consent
very
well
miss
brooke
i
will
draw
a
figure
for
this
next
vacant
space
and
carry
it
as
far
as
i
know
how
if
wharton
objects
he
can
efface
it
but
miss
dudley
will
have
to
finish
it
for
me
for
i
ca
paint
and
wharton
would
certainly
stop
me
if
i
tried
although
this
pretty
bargain
which
seemed
so
fair
really
threw
on
esther
the
whole
burden
of
writing
sonnets
and
painting
portraits
for
the
amusement
of
catherine
and
mr
hazard
catherine
begged
so
hard
that
she
at
last
consented
to
do
her
best
and
her
consent
so
much
delighted
hazard
that
he
instantly
searched
his
books
for
a
model
to
work
from
and
as
soon
as
he
found
one
to
answer
his
purpose
he
began
with
esther
crayons
to
draw
the
cartoon
of
a
large
figure
which
was
to
preserve
under
the
character
of
luke
the
memory
of
features
when
wharton
came
next
to
inspect
esther
work
he
was
told
that
mr
hazard
wished
to
try
his
hand
on
designing
a
figure
for
the
vacant
space
and
he
criticised
and
corrected
it
as
freely
as
the
rest
for
such
a
task
hazard
was
almost
as
competent
as
wharton
from
the
moment
the
idea
was
once
given
and
in
this
dark
corner
it
mattered
little
whether
a
conventional
saint
were
more
or
less
correct
meanwhile
catherine
carried
off
a
copy
of
petrarch
and
instantly
turned
it
over
to
esther
seeming
to
think
it
a
matter
of
course
that
she
should
do
so
trifling
a
matter
as
a
sonnet
with
ease
it
wo
take
you
five
minutes
if
you
put
your
mind
to
it
she
said
you
can
do
any
thing
you
like
and
any
one
could
make
a
few
rhymes
esther
willing
to
please
her
tried
and
exhausted
her
patience
on
the
first
three
lines
then
catherine
told
the
story
to
dudley
who
was
so
much
amused
by
her
ambition
that
he
gave
his
active
aid
and
between
them
they
succeeded
in
helping
esther
to
make
out
a
sonnet
which
dudley
declared
to
be
quite
good
enough
for
hazard
this
done
esther
refused
to
mix
further
in
the
matter
and
made
catherine
learn
her
verses
by
heart
the
young
woman
found
this
no
easy
task
but
when
she
thought
herself
perfect
she
told
mr
hazard
as
she
would
have
told
a
schoolmaster
that
she
was
ready
with
her
sonnet
i
have
finished
the
sonnet
mr
hazard
she
said
one
morning
in
a
bashful
voice
as
though
she
were
again
at
school
where
is
it
miss
brooke
then
catherine
drawing
herself
up
with
her
hands
behind
her
began
to
recite
oh
little
bird
singing
upon
your
way
or
mourning
for
your
pleasant
seeing
the
night
and
winter
at
your
side
the
joyous
months
behind
and
sunny
day
if
as
you
know
your
own
pathetic
lay
you
knew
as
well
the
sorrows
that
i
hide
nestling
upon
my
breast
you
would
divide
its
weary
woes
and
lift
their
load
away
i
know
not
that
our
shares
would
then
be
even
for
she
you
mourn
may
yet
make
glad
your
sight
while
against
me
are
banded
death
and
heaven
but
now
the
gloom
of
winter
and
of
night
with
thoughts
of
sweet
and
bitter
years
for
leaven
lends
to
my
talk
with
you
a
sad
delight
esther
laughed
till
the
tears
rolled
down
her
face
at
the
droll
effect
of
these
tenderly
sentimental
verses
in
catherine
mouth
but
hazard
took
it
quite
seriously
and
was
so
much
delighted
with
recitation
that
he
insisted
on
her
repeating
it
to
wharton
who
took
it
even
more
seriously
than
he
hazard
knew
that
the
verses
were
esther
and
was
not
disposed
to
laugh
at
them
wharton
saw
that
catherine
came
out
with
new
beauties
in
every
she
filled
and
already
wanted
to
use
her
as
a
model
for
some
future
frescoed
euterpe
esther
was
driven
to
laugh
alone
petrarch
and
laura
are
dangerous
subjects
of
study
for
young
people
in
a
church
wharton
and
hazard
knew
by
heart
scores
of
the
sonnets
and
were
fond
of
repeating
verses
either
in
the
original
or
in
their
own
translations
and
esther
soon
picked
up
what
they
let
fall
being
quick
at
catching
what
was
thrown
to
her
she
caught
verse
after
verse
of
hazard
favorites
and
sometimes
he
could
hear
her
murmuring
as
she
painted
siccome
eterna
vita
è
veder
dio
nè
più
si
brama
nè
bramar
piu
lice
and
at
such
moments
he
began
to
think
that
he
was
himself
petrarch
and
that
to
repeat
to
his
laura
the
next
two
verses
of
the
sonnet
had
become
the
destiny
of
his
life
so
the
weeks
ran
on
until
after
a
month
of
hard
work
the
last
days
of
january
saw
the
two
figures
nearly
completed
when
in
due
time
the
meaning
of
luke
became
evident
esther
and
catherine
waited
in
fear
to
see
how
wharton
would
take
the
liberty
on
which
they
had
so
rashly
ventured
as
the
likeness
came
out
more
strongly
he
stopped
one
morning
before
it
when
esther
after
finishing
her
own
task
was
working
on
mr
hazard
design
by
our
lady
of
love
said
wharton
with
a
start
and
a
laugh
now
i
see
what
mischief
you
three
have
been
at
the
church
would
not
have
been
complete
without
it
said
esther
timidly
for
several
minutes
wharton
looked
in
silence
at
the
cecilia
and
at
the
figure
which
now
seemed
its
companion
then
he
said
turning
away
i
shall
not
be
the
first
unworthy
saint
the
church
has
canonized
esther
drew
a
long
breath
of
relief
catherine
started
up
radiant
with
delight
and
thus
it
happens
that
on
the
walls
of
john
high
above
the
world
of
vanities
beneath
them
wharton
stands
and
will
stand
for
ages
gazing
at
catherine
brooke
now
that
the
two
saints
were
nearly
finished
esther
became
a
little
depressed
this
church
life
like
a
bit
of
religious
bohemianism
and
acted
poetry
had
amused
her
so
greatly
that
she
found
her
own
small
studio
dull
she
could
no
longer
work
there
without
missing
the
space
the
echoes
the
company
and
above
all
the
sense
of
purpose
which
she
felt
on
her
scaffolding
she
complained
to
wharton
of
her
feminine
want
of
motive
in
life
i
wish
i
earned
my
living
she
said
you
do
know
what
it
is
to
work
without
an
object
much
of
the
best
work
in
the
world
said
he
has
been
done
with
no
motive
of
gain
men
can
do
so
many
things
that
women
ca
said
she
men
like
to
work
alone
women
can
not
work
without
company
do
you
like
solitude
i
would
like
to
own
a
private
desert
he
answered
and
live
alone
in
the
middle
of
it
with
lions
and
tigers
to
eat
intruders
you
need
not
go
so
far
said
she
take
my
studio
with
you
and
miss
brooke
in
the
neighborhood
never
we
will
let
you
alone
in
a
week
you
will
put
your
head
out
of
the
door
and
say
come
and
play
with
me
catherine
was
not
pleased
at
the
thought
that
her
usefulness
was
at
an
end
she
had
no
longer
a
part
to
play
unless
it
were
that
of
duenna
to
esther
and
for
this
she
was
not
so
well
fitted
as
she
might
have
been
had
providence
thought
proper
to
make
her
differently
indeed
anxiety
to
do
her
duty
as
duenna
to
catherine
was
becoming
so
sharp
that
it
threatened
to
interfere
with
the
pleasure
of
both
catherine
did
her
best
to
give
her
friend
trouble
please
rub
me
all
out
wharton
said
she
and
make
esther
begin
again
i
am
sure
she
will
do
it
better
the
next
time
wharton
was
quite
ready
to
find
an
excuse
for
pleasing
her
if
it
was
at
times
a
little
annoying
to
have
two
women
in
his
way
whom
he
could
not
control
as
easily
as
ordinary
he
had
become
so
used
to
the
restraint
as
not
to
feel
it
often
and
not
to
regard
it
much
esther
thought
he
need
not
distress
himself
by
thinking
that
he
regarded
it
at
all
had
not
catherine
been
so
anxious
to
appear
as
the
most
docile
and
obedient
of
besides
being
the
of
prairie
creatures
she
would
long
ago
have
resented
his
habit
of
first
petting
then
scolding
next
ignoring
and
again
flattering
her
as
his
mood
happened
to
prompt
he
was
more
respectful
with
esther
and
kept
out
of
her
way
when
he
was
moody
while
she
made
it
a
rule
never
to
leave
her
own
place
of
work
unless
first
invited
but
catherine
who
was
much
by
his
side
got
used
to
which
she
bore
with
angelic
meekness
when
she
found
herself
left
forgotten
in
a
corner
or
unanswered
when
she
spoke
or
unnoticed
when
she
bade
him
she
consoled
herself
with
reflecting
that
after
every
rudeness
wharton
regard
for
her
seemed
to
rise
and
he
took
her
more
and
more
into
his
confidence
with
every
new
brutality
some
day
he
will
drag
you
to
the
altar
by
the
hair
said
esther
and
tell
you
that
his
happiness
requires
you
to
be
his
wife
i
wish
he
would
try
said
catherine
with
a
little
look
of
humor
but
he
has
one
wife
already
she
mysteriously
disappeared
replied
esther
some
day
you
will
find
her
skeleton
poor
thing
do
you
think
so
said
catherine
gravely
how
fascinating
he
is
he
makes
me
shiver
when
catherine
begged
to
have
every
thing
begun
again
wharton
hesitated
esther
work
was
not
to
his
taste
but
he
was
not
at
all
sure
that
she
would
do
equally
well
if
she
tried
to
imitate
his
own
manner
you
know
i
wanted
miss
dudley
to
put
more
religious
feeling
and
force
into
her
painting
said
he
but
you
all
united
and
rode
me
down
i
will
look
like
a
real
angel
this
time
said
catherine
now
i
know
what
it
is
you
want
i
am
more
than
half
on
her
side
went
on
wharton
i
am
not
sure
that
she
is
wrong
it
all
comes
to
this
is
religion
a
struggle
or
a
joy
to
me
it
is
a
terrible
battle
to
be
won
or
lost
i
like
your
green
dress
with
the
violets
whose
idea
was
that
petrarch
you
know
i
am
laura
cecilia
has
the
dress
which
laura
wore
in
church
when
petrarch
first
saw
her
no
said
wharton
after
another
pause
and
long
study
of
the
two
figures
decidedly
i
will
not
rub
you
out
but
i
mean
to
touch
up
petrarch
o
you
wo
spoil
the
likeness
not
at
all
but
if
i
am
going
to
posterity
by
your
side
i
want
some
expression
in
my
face
petrarch
was
a
man
of
troubles
you
promise
not
to
change
the
idea
i
promise
to
look
at
you
as
long
as
you
look
at
me
said
wharton
gloomily
meanwhile
esther
had
a
talk
with
mr
hazard
which
left
her
more
in
doubt
than
ever
as
to
what
she
had
best
do
he
urged
her
to
begin
something
new
and
to
do
it
in
a
more
strenuous
spirit
you
are
learning
from
wharton
said
he
why
should
you
stop
at
the
very
moment
when
you
have
most
to
gain
i
am
learning
nothing
but
what
i
knew
before
she
answered
sadly
he
can
teach
only
grand
art
and
i
am
fit
only
for
trifles
try
one
more
figure
esther
shook
her
head
my
cecilia
is
a
failure
she
went
on
wharton
said
it
would
be
and
he
was
right
i
should
do
no
better
next
time
unless
i
took
his
design
and
carried
it
out
exactly
as
he
orders
one
first
attempt
is
always
an
experiment
try
once
more
i
should
only
spoil
your
church
in
the
middle
of
your
best
sermon
your
audience
would
see
you
look
up
here
and
laugh
you
are
challenging
compliments
what
i
could
do
nicely
would
be
to
paint
squirrels
and
monkeys
playing
on
vines
round
the
choir
or
daisies
and
buttercups
in
a
row
with
one
tall
daisy
in
each
group
of
five
that
is
the
way
for
a
woman
to
make
herself
useful
be
serious
i
feel
more
solemn
than
wharton
great
figure
of
john
of
patmos
i
am
going
home
to
burn
my
brushes
and
break
my
palette
what
is
the
use
of
trying
to
go
forward
when
one
feels
iron
bars
across
one
face
be
reasonable
miss
dudley
if
wharton
is
willing
to
teach
why
not
be
willing
to
learn
you
are
not
to
be
the
judge
if
i
think
your
work
good
have
i
not
a
right
to
call
on
you
for
it
oh
yes
you
have
a
right
to
call
and
i
have
a
right
to
refuse
i
will
paint
no
more
religious
subjects
i
have
not
enough
soul
my
cecilia
looks
like
a
nursery
governess
playing
a
waltz
for
saints
to
dance
by
there
was
a
tone
of
real
mortification
in
esther
voice
as
she
looked
once
more
at
the
figure
on
the
wall
and
felt
how
weak
it
seemed
by
the
side
of
wharton
masculine
work
then
she
suddenly
changed
her
mind
and
did
just
what
he
asked
if
wharton
will
consent
i
will
begin
again
and
paint
it
all
over
a
woman
could
easily
have
seen
that
she
was
torn
in
opposite
directions
by
motives
of
a
very
contrary
kind
but
mr
hazard
did
not
speculate
on
this
subject
he
was
glad
to
carry
his
point
and
let
the
matter
rest
there
it
was
agreed
that
the
next
morning
wharton
should
decide
upon
the
proper
course
to
be
taken
and
if
he
chose
to
reject
her
figure
she
should
begin
it
again
esther
and
catherine
went
home
but
esther
was
ill
at
ease
that
her
cecilia
did
not
come
up
to
the
level
of
her
ambition
was
a
matter
of
course
and
she
was
prepared
for
the
disappointment
whose
first
attempt
in
a
new
style
ever
paired
with
its
conception
she
felt
that
mr
hazard
would
think
her
wayward
and
weak
she
could
not
tell
him
the
real
reason
of
her
perplexity
she
would
have
liked
to
work
on
patiently
under
wharton
orders
without
a
thought
of
herself
but
how
could
she
do
so
when
hazard
was
day
by
day
coming
nearer
and
nearer
until
already
their
hands
almost
touched
if
she
had
not
liked
him
the
question
could
easily
have
been
settled
but
she
did
like
him
and
when
she
said
this
to
herself
she
turned
scarlet
at
the
thought
that
he
liked
her
and
what
should
she
do
with
a
heavy
heart
she
made
up
her
mind
that
there
was
but
one
thing
to
be
done
she
must
retreat
into
her
own
house
and
bar
the
doors
if
he
did
not
see
that
such
an
intimacy
was
sure
to
make
trouble
for
him
she
who
felt
if
she
did
not
see
the
gulf
that
separated
them
must
teach
him
better
whether
she
would
have
held
to
this
wise
and
prudent
course
against
his
entreaties
and
wharton
commands
will
never
be
known
for
the
question
which
at
the
moment
seemed
to
her
so
hard
to
decide
was
already
answered
by
fates
which
left
her
no
voice
in
the
matter
the
next
morning
when
the
two
girls
rather
later
than
usual
reached
the
south
door
of
the
church
where
a
stern
guardian
always
stood
to
watch
lest
wolves
entered
under
pretense
of
business
they
saw
a
woman
standing
on
the
steps
and
gazing
at
them
as
they
approached
from
the
avenue
in
this
they
found
nothing
to
surprise
them
but
as
they
came
face
to
face
with
her
they
noticed
that
the
stranger
dress
and
features
were
peculiar
and
uncommon
even
in
new
york
the
sink
of
races
although
the
weather
was
not
cold
she
wore
a
fur
cap
picturesque
but
much
worn
far
from
neat
and
matching
in
dirt
as
in
style
a
sort
of
polish
or
hungarian
capote
thrown
over
her
shoulders
her
features
were
strong
coarse
and
bloated
her
eyes
alone
were
fine
when
she
suddenly
spoke
to
esther
her
voice
was
rough
like
her
features
and
though
esther
had
seen
too
little
of
life
to
know
what
depths
of
degradation
such
a
face
and
voice
meant
she
drew
back
with
some
alarm
the
woman
spoke
in
french
only
to
ask
whether
this
was
the
church
of
john
replying
shortly
that
it
was
esther
passed
in
without
waiting
for
another
question
but
as
she
climbed
the
narrow
and
rough
staircase
to
her
gallery
she
said
to
catherine
who
was
close
behind
somewhere
i
have
seen
that
woman
eyes
so
have
i
answered
catherine
in
a
tone
of
suppressed
excitement
so
unusual
that
esther
stopped
short
on
the
step
and
turned
round
do
you
know
where
asked
catherine
without
waiting
to
be
questioned
where
was
it
in
my
picture
wharton
gave
me
her
eyes
i
am
sure
that
woman
is
his
wife
catherine
you
shall
go
back
to
colorado
you
have
been
reading
too
many
novels
you
are
as
romantic
as
a
man
catherine
did
not
care
whether
she
were
romantic
or
not
she
knew
the
woman
was
wharton
wife
perhaps
she
means
to
kill
him
she
ran
on
in
a
tone
would
it
be
like
wharton
to
be
stabbed
to
the
heart
on
the
steps
of
a
church
just
as
his
great
work
was
done
do
you
know
i
think
he
would
like
it
he
is
dying
to
be
tragic
like
the
venetians
and
have
some
one
write
a
poem
about
him
then
after
a
moment
pause
she
added
in
the
same
indifferent
tone
of
voice
all
the
same
if
he
not
there
i
mean
to
go
back
and
look
out
for
him
i
not
going
to
let
that
woman
kill
him
if
i
can
help
it
a
warm
dispute
arose
between
the
two
girls
which
continued
after
they
reached
their
scaffold
and
found
that
wharton
was
not
there
esther
declared
that
catherine
should
not
go
back
it
was
ridiculous
and
improper
wharton
would
laugh
in
her
face
and
think
her
bold
and
impertinent
the
woman
was
probably
a
beggar
who
wanted
to
see
mr
hazard
and
when
all
this
was
of
no
avail
esther
insisted
that
catherine
should
not
go
alone
catherine
on
her
part
declared
that
she
was
not
afraid
of
the
woman
or
of
any
woman
or
man
either
or
of
wharton
and
that
she
meant
to
walk
down
the
avenue
and
meet
him
and
tell
him
that
this
person
was
there
she
was
on
the
point
of
doing
what
she
threatened
when
they
saw
wharton
himself
cross
the
church
beneath
and
slowly
climb
the
stairs
the
two
girls
dismissing
their
alarm
as
easily
as
they
had
taken
it
up
turned
to
their
own
affairs
again
in
a
few
minutes
wharton
appeared
on
the
scaffolding
and
went
to
his
regular
after
a
time
they
saw
him
coming
to
their
corner
he
looked
paler
than
usual
and
more
abstracted
and
what
was
unusual
he
carried
a
brush
in
his
hand
as
though
he
had
broken
off
his
work
without
thinking
what
he
was
doing
he
hardly
noticed
them
but
sat
down
holding
the
brush
with
both
hands
though
it
was
wet
for
some
time
he
looked
at
the
cecilia
without
a
word
then
he
began
abruptly
you
quite
right
it
not
good
it
not
handled
in
a
large
way
or
in
keeping
with
the
work
round
it
you
might
do
it
again
much
better
but
it
is
you
and
it
is
she
i
would
leave
it
i
will
leave
it
if
necessary
i
could
in
a
few
days
paint
it
all
over
and
make
it
harmonize
but
i
should
spoil
it
i
can
draw
better
and
paint
better
but
i
make
a
young
girl
from
colorado
as
pure
and
fresh
as
that
to
me
religion
is
passion
to
reach
heaven
you
must
go
through
hell
and
carry
its
marks
on
your
face
and
figure
i
ca
paint
innocence
without
suggesting
sin
but
you
can
and
the
church
likes
it
put
your
own
sanctity
on
the
wall
beside
my
martyrdom
esther
thought
it
would
be
civil
on
her
part
to
say
something
at
this
point
but
wharton
remarks
seemed
to
be
made
to
no
one
in
particular
and
she
was
not
quite
certain
that
they
were
meant
for
her
in
spite
of
the
words
he
did
not
look
at
her
she
was
used
to
his
peculiar
moods
and
soliloquies
and
had
learned
to
be
silent
at
such
times
she
sat
silent
now
but
catherine
who
took
greater
liberties
with
him
was
bolder
why
ca
you
paint
innocence
she
asked
i
am
going
to
tell
you
he
replied
with
more
quickness
of
manner
it
is
to
be
the
subject
of
my
last
lecture
ladies
school
must
close
esther
and
catherine
glanced
at
each
other
you
are
going
to
send
us
away
asked
catherine
in
a
tone
of
surprise
you
must
go
for
the
present
answered
wharton
i
mean
to
tell
you
the
reason
and
then
you
will
see
why
i
ca
paint
innocence
as
you
can
as
a
lecture
on
art
my
life
is
worth
hearing
but
do
interrupt
the
story
or
you
will
lose
it
begin
by
keeping
in
your
mind
that
twenty
years
ago
i
was
a
ragged
boy
in
the
streets
of
cincinnati
the
drawing
master
in
a
public
school
to
which
i
went
said
i
had
a
natural
talent
for
drawing
and
taught
me
all
he
knew
then
a
little
purse
was
made
up
for
me
and
i
was
sent
to
paris
not
yet
twenty
years
old
i
found
myself
dropped
into
that
great
sewer
of
a
city
a
shy
boy
knowing
no
more
of
the
world
above
me
than
a
fish
knows
of
the
birds
for
two
years
i
knocked
about
in
a
studio
till
my
money
was
used
up
and
then
i
knew
enough
to
be
able
to
earn
a
few
francs
to
keep
me
alive
then
i
went
down
to
italy
and
of
course
got
a
fever
i
came
back
at
last
to
paris
dyspeptic
and
morbid
i
had
visions
and
the
worst
vision
of
my
life
i
am
going
to
tell
you
it
was
after
i
had
been
some
years
at
work
and
had
got
already
a
little
reputation
among
americans
that
i
was
at
my
worst
nothing
seemed
real
what
earned
me
my
first
success
was
an
attempt
i
made
to
paint
the
strange
figures
and
fancies
which
possessed
me
i
studied
nothing
but
the
most
extravagant
subjects
for
a
time
nothing
would
satisfy
me
but
to
draw
from
models
at
moments
of
intense
suffering
and
at
the
instant
of
death
models
of
that
kind
do
not
offer
themselves
and
are
not
to
be
bought
i
made
friends
with
the
surgeons
and
got
myself
admitted
to
one
of
the
great
hospitals
i
happened
to
be
there
one
day
when
a
woman
was
brought
in
suffering
from
an
overdose
of
arsenic
this
was
the
kind
of
subject
i
wanted
she
was
fierce
splendid
a
priestess
of
the
oracle
tortured
by
agony
and
clinging
to
it
as
though
it
were
a
delight
the
next
day
i
came
back
to
look
for
her
she
was
then
exhausted
and
half
dead
she
was
a
superb
model
and
i
took
an
interest
in
her
when
she
grew
better
i
talked
with
her
and
found
that
she
was
a
sort
of
parisian
pole
with
a
strange
history
she
had
been
living
as
an
actress
at
one
of
the
small
theaters
and
had
attempted
suicide
in
sheer
disgust
with
life
i
had
played
with
the
same
idea
for
years
we
had
both
struggled
with
the
world
and
hated
it
her
imagination
was
more
morbid
than
my
own
and
in
her
quieter
moments
when
her
affections
were
roused
she
was
wonderfully
tender
and
devoted
when
she
left
the
hospital
she
put
herself
under
my
protection
i
believe
she
loved
me
and
no
one
had
ever
loved
me
before
i
know
she
took
possession
of
me
body
and
soul
i
married
her
i
would
just
as
willingly
have
jumped
into
the
seine
with
her
if
she
had
preferred
it
for
three
months
we
lived
together
while
i
finished
the
picture
which
i
called
the
priestess
of
delphi
painted
from
my
drawings
of
her
in
her
agony
the
picture
made
a
great
noise
in
paris
and
brought
me
some
new
friends
among
the
rest
one
who
i
think
really
saved
me
from
charenton
hazard
called
at
my
studio
just
as
my
troubles
were
beginning
to
tear
me
to
pieces
my
wife
had
the
temper
of
a
fury
and
all
the
vices
of
paris
excitement
was
her
passion
she
could
not
stand
the
quiet
of
an
artist
life
yet
her
bohemian
instincts
came
over
her
only
in
waves
and
when
they
left
her
in
peace
she
still
had
splendid
qualities
that
held
me
to
her
hazard
came
in
upon
us
one
day
in
the
middle
of
a
terrible
scene
when
she
was
threatening
again
to
take
her
own
life
and
trying
or
pretending
to
try
to
take
mine
when
he
came
in
she
disappeared
the
next
i
heard
of
her
she
was
back
on
the
stage
lost
i
was
worn
out
my
nervous
system
was
all
gone
then
hazard
came
to
my
help
and
took
me
off
with
him
to
the
south
of
europe
our
first
stage
was
to
avignon
and
vaucluse
and
there
i
found
how
curiously
my
experience
had
affected
my
art
i
had
learned
to
adore
purity
and
repose
but
i
could
never
get
hold
of
my
ideal
fifty
times
i
tried
to
draw
laura
as
i
wanted
to
realize
her
and
every
time
i
failed
i
knew
the
secret
of
petrarch
and
i
could
not
tell
it
my
wife
came
between
me
and
my
thought
all
life
took
form
in
my
hands
as
a
passion
if
i
could
learn
again
to
paint
a
child
or
any
thing
that
had
not
the
world
in
its
eyes
i
should
be
at
peace
at
last
as
he
paused
here
and
seemed
again
to
be
musing
over
cecilia
esther
curiosity
made
her
put
in
a
word
and
your
wife
she
asked
my
wife
he
repeated
in
his
abstracted
tone
i
never
saw
her
again
till
this
morning
when
i
met
her
on
the
steps
of
the
church
then
it
was
your
wife
cried
catherine
you
saw
her
he
asked
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
i
wo
ask
what
you
thought
of
her
i
knew
her
by
her
eyes
cried
catherine
i
thought
she
meant
to
shoot
you
and
when
you
came
in
i
was
just
going
to
warn
you
now
you
see
esther
i
was
right
wharton
leaned
over
and
took
catherine
hand
thank
you
said
he
i
believe
you
are
my
good
angel
but
you
remind
me
of
what
i
came
to
say
the
woman
is
quite
capable
of
that
or
of
any
other
scandal
and
of
course
hazard
church
must
not
be
exposed
to
such
a
risk
i
shall
come
here
no
longer
for
the
present
neither
must
you
i
am
bound
to
take
care
of
my
friends
but
you
said
esther
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
nothing
what
can
i
do
do
you
mean
said
catherine
with
a
comical
fierceness
in
her
voice
as
though
she
wanted
herself
to
take
the
french
actress
in
hand
do
you
mean
to
let
that
woman
worry
you
how
she
likes
the
fault
was
mine
replied
wharton
i
gave
her
my
life
after
all
she
is
my
wife
and
i
ca
help
it
i
have
promised
to
meet
her
this
afternoon
at
my
studio
even
to
these
two
girls
there
was
something
so
helpless
in
ideas
of
life
that
they
protested
against
his
conduct
catherine
was
speechless
with
inability
to
understand
what
he
meant
esther
boldly
interfered
you
must
do
nothing
without
advice
said
she
wait
till
mr
hazard
comes
and
consult
him
if
you
ca
see
him
promise
me
to
go
to
my
uncle
murray
and
let
him
take
charge
of
this
woman
you
will
ruin
your
whole
life
if
you
let
her
into
it
again
it
is
ruined
already
answered
wharton
gloomily
i
had
that
one
chance
of
happiness
and
i
can
never
have
another
nevertheless
he
promised
to
wait
for
hazard
and
the
two
girls
obediently
bade
him
catherine
eyes
were
full
of
tears
as
he
held
her
hand
and
begged
her
pardon
for
his
rudeness
a
little
romance
was
passing
out
of
her
life
she
went
down
the
stairs
after
esther
without
a
word
as
they
left
the
church
they
saw
the
woman
on
the
pavement
outside
still
walking
up
and
down
catherine
passed
her
with
a
glance
of
repulsion
and
defiance
that
made
the
woman
turn
and
watch
her
till
they
disappeared
down
the
avenue
an
hour
afterwards
a
quick
step
hurried
up
the
stair
and
hazard
evidently
much
disturbed
appeared
on
the
scaffolding
he
found
wharton
where
the
two
girls
had
left
him
sitting
alone
before
cecilia
the
broken
brush
still
in
his
hands
and
his
left
hand
red
with
the
wet
paint
his
face
was
paler
than
ever
and
over
the
left
temple
was
a
large
red
spot
as
though
he
had
been
pressing
his
hands
to
his
forehead
hazard
looked
for
a
moment
at
the
white
face
contrasting
painfully
with
its
ghastly
spot
of
intense
red
and
then
spoke
with
assumed
indifference
so
she
has
turned
up
again
wharton
returned
his
look
with
a
weak
smile
which
made
his
face
still
more
horrible
and
slowly
answered
i
have
worse
news
than
that
more
bad
news
said
hazard
tell
me
what
you
think
continued
wharton
in
the
same
dreamy
tone
you
see
that
cecilia
there
hazard
glanced
at
the
figure
and
back
to
wharton
without
speaking
presently
wharton
added
with
a
smile
of
inexpressible
content
well
i
love
her
esther
regrets
on
quitting
her
work
at
the
church
lasted
not
so
long
as
catherine
though
they
were
more
serious
she
had
already
begun
to
feel
alarmed
about
her
father
condition
and
nothing
but
his
positive
order
had
induced
her
to
leave
him
even
for
a
few
hours
every
day
she
had
seen
that
his
strength
steadily
failed
he
suffered
paroxysms
of
pain
he
lost
consciousness
more
than
once
and
although
he
insisted
to
the
last
on
acting
as
though
he
were
well
his
weakness
increased
until
he
could
no
longer
sit
out
a
game
of
whist
but
was
forced
to
lie
on
the
sofa
in
his
library
where
he
liked
to
see
every
visitor
who
came
to
the
house
he
required
that
every
thing
about
him
should
go
on
as
usual
and
not
only
made
esther
go
regularly
to
her
work
but
took
keen
interest
in
hearing
from
her
and
catherine
all
that
was
said
and
done
at
the
church
he
delighted
in
laughing
at
catherine
about
her
romantic
relations
with
wharton
but
he
made
no
jokes
about
mr
hazard
he
thought
from
the
first
that
this
intimacy
might
be
a
serious
matter
for
esther
but
he
would
not
again
interfere
in
her
affairs
and
feared
making
things
worse
by
noticing
them
he
watched
hazard
sharply
until
esther
had
the
uncomfortable
sense
of
feeling
that
her
father
eyes
were
never
far
away
from
the
clergyman
when
he
came
to
the
house
she
knew
or
fancied
she
knew
every
thought
in
her
father
mind
and
his
silence
embarrassed
her
more
than
criticism
could
have
done
she
asked
herself
in
vain
why
her
father
disliking
the
clergy
as
she
knew
he
did
should
suddenly
admit
a
clergyman
into
his
intimacy
in
truth
dudley
looked
on
himself
as
no
longer
having
a
right
to
speak
his
feelings
and
prejudices
were
to
be
kept
out
of
her
life
but
he
could
watch
and
the
longer
he
watched
the
more
intense
his
interest
became
when
esther
and
catherine
returned
from
the
church
with
their
account
of
wharton
wife
their
first
act
was
to
tell
the
story
to
dudley
who
lay
on
his
sofa
and
listened
with
keen
interest
i
suppose
you
meant
to
come
back
for
my
revolver
said
he
to
catherine
whose
little
explosions
of
courage
always
amused
him
i
think
i
could
almost
have
crawled
round
to
see
you
take
a
shot
at
your
french
friend
as
she
started
for
you
oh
no
said
catherine
modestly
i
would
have
given
the
revolver
to
mr
wharton
do
do
it
catherine
wharton
could
not
hit
the
church
door
with
it
suppose
he
had
shot
you
instead
of
the
other
woman
of
course
said
catherine
reflectively
he
would
know
how
to
use
a
revolver
would
he
i
suppose
i
ought
to
teach
him
better
not
said
dudley
keep
him
under
you
may
have
to
talk
with
him
one
of
these
days
after
you
have
settled
your
little
misunderstanding
with
his
wife
catherine
took
chaff
with
such
gravity
that
even
dudley
could
not
always
make
out
whether
she
was
in
jest
or
earnest
she
had
a
quaint
serious
way
of
accepting
any
sort
of
challenge
and
going
it
better
as
strong
expressed
it
which
left
her
assailants
wholly
in
the
dark
dudley
wanted
to
stop
any
romantic
nonsense
between
her
and
wharton
but
could
never
quite
make
out
whether
she
cared
for
him
or
not
esther
thought
not
that
evening
they
all
hoped
that
hazard
would
come
in
to
tell
them
what
other
scenes
had
occurred
and
under
this
little
excitement
dudley
felt
strong
enough
to
appear
like
himself
although
he
dared
not
rise
from
his
sofa
at
about
eight
they
were
gratified
mr
hazard
appeared
and
was
received
with
such
cordiality
and
intimacy
as
went
far
to
make
him
feel
himself
a
member
of
the
family
thank
you
said
dudley
we
have
done
nothing
but
run
to
the
to
see
if
you
were
coming
tell
us
quickly
the
ghastly
news
we
are
prepared
for
the
worst
if
you
read
turgenieff
replied
hazard
you
can
imagine
the
kind
of
experience
we
have
had
i
feel
as
though
i
had
stolen
a
chapter
from
one
of
his
stories
no
matter
spoil
it
promptly
we
never
read
any
thing
may
i
have
first
a
cup
of
tea
miss
dudley
thank
you
that
woman
has
left
a
taste
on
my
palate
that
all
the
tea
in
china
will
never
wash
off
where
shall
i
begin
where
we
left
off
said
esther
we
left
wharton
in
the
church
at
eleven
and
the
woman
marching
up
and
down
outside
at
noon
i
found
her
there
and
knew
her
at
once
though
it
is
ten
years
since
i
last
saw
her
she
is
a
person
whom
one
does
not
forget
i
asked
her
what
she
wanted
it
seemed
that
wharton
in
his
confusion
had
told
her
to
come
to
his
studio
without
saying
where
it
was
and
she
was
waiting
for
him
to
come
out
again
i
gave
her
the
address
and
sent
her
away
then
i
went
up
to
wharton
whom
i
found
in
a
strange
state
of
mind
he
seemed
dazed
and
showed
no
interest
in
the
affair
he
would
not
talk
of
his
wife
at
all
until
i
forced
him
at
length
after
a
struggle
as
he
said
that
miss
dudley
had
told
him
to
go
to
her
uncle
murray
i
got
him
into
a
carriage
and
we
drove
to
murray
office
the
upshot
was
that
murray
and
i
took
the
matter
into
our
hands
and
decided
to
meet
the
woman
ourselves
in
his
company
at
the
hour
fixed
we
went
all
three
of
us
to
the
studio
it
needed
at
least
three
of
us
to
deal
with
that
one
woman
when
i
saw
her
in
paris
she
was
still
young
and
handsome
with
superb
eyes
and
a
kind
of
eastern
tread
you
could
imagine
her
when
she
did
not
speak
as
semiramis
medea
clytemnestra
except
that
when
you
saw
a
little
more
of
her
you
felt
that
she
was
only
a
heroine
of
a
cheap
theater
wharton
could
not
have
been
fascinated
by
her
if
at
that
time
of
his
life
he
had
ever
known
a
refined
woman
or
mixed
at
all
in
the
world
but
she
certainly
had
a
gypsy
charm
and
seemed
to
carry
oceans
of
sahara
and
caravans
of
camels
about
with
her
when
she
was
in
one
of
her
furies
it
was
an
echo
of
the
whole
greek
drama
this
you
must
recollect
was
ten
years
ago
and
even
then
she
was
spoiled
by
being
coarse
and
melodramatic
but
now
she
is
a
horror
she
suggests
nothing
but
the
penitentiary
when
she
saw
that
there
were
three
of
us
she
flew
into
a
whirlwind
of
passion
and
screamed
french
that
i
was
glad
to
find
i
could
not
wholly
understand
her
dialect
must
come
from
the
worst
class
of
parisian
thieves
i
should
have
been
glad
to
understand
less
than
i
did
every
now
and
then
she
interrupted
this
billingsgate
and
seemed
to
think
that
her
dignity
required
a
loftier
style
and
she
poured
out
on
us
whole
pages
of
cheap
melodrama
she
began
by
flinging
her
fur
cap
and
cloak
on
the
floor
and
striking
a
stage
attitude
she
wanted
to
know
who
we
were
by
what
right
did
we
mix
ourselves
in
this
affair
and
come
between
a
villain
and
his
victim
then
she
turned
on
wharton
and
began
gesticulating
and
throwing
herself
into
contortions
like
a
maenad
repeating
again
and
again
that
he
was
her
husband
an
a
and
that
she
would
take
his
life
if
she
were
not
given
her
rights
she
drew
herself
up
in
all
her
height
and
growled
in
her
deepest
voice
vais
then
she
changed
her
tone
and
sobbed
violently
that
on
second
thoughts
she
preferred
to
kill
herself
and
finally
tore
a
small
stage
dagger
from
her
breast
and
proposed
to
kill
us
all
and
herself
too
how
many
did
she
manage
in
the
end
asked
dudley
how
did
wharton
bear
it
asked
esther
wharton
stood
it
very
well
replied
hazard
he
was
sitting
near
her
and
now
and
then
she
made
a
rush
at
him
as
though
she
really
meant
to
strike
him
he
never
moved
or
spoke
or
took
his
eyes
away
from
her
i
think
he
was
overcome
by
association
he
thought
himself
back
in
paris
ten
years
ago
doubtless
this
excellent
woman
has
faults
owing
to
a
defective
education
said
dudley
with
his
usual
dry
we
must
make
allowances
for
them
i
am
more
curious
to
know
whether
she
got
the
better
of
my
astute
murray
took
an
unfair
advantage
over
her
said
hazard
he
had
taken
the
precaution
to
post
a
police
officer
in
the
next
room
and
after
the
woman
had
exhausted
herself
and
i
think
too
had
worn
off
the
effects
of
the
brandy
she
reeked
with
he
told
her
that
she
would
go
instantly
to
the
police
station
if
she
did
not
behave
herself
i
think
her
imagination
must
have
taught
her
that
an
american
police
station
might
be
something
very
terrible
for
in
a
few
minutes
she
quieted
down
and
was
only
eager
for
money
i
suppose
murray
means
to
terrify
this
poor
creature
into
a
sacrifice
of
her
rights
said
dudley
wharton
will
have
to
settle
an
annuity
on
her
in
order
to
get
her
back
to
europe
and
keep
her
there
in
return
she
has
got
to
consent
to
a
divorce
murray
insists
on
this
as
his
first
condition
wharton
began
to
say
that
she
was
his
wife
and
that
he
was
bound
to
take
care
of
her
until
at
last
murray
told
him
to
take
himself
off
or
he
would
have
no
more
to
do
with
the
case
so
the
woman
on
receiving
some
money
on
the
spot
consents
to
deal
with
murray
directly
on
his
terms
and
wharton
leaves
town
till
the
papers
are
drawn
up
and
the
woman
packed
off
he
has
had
a
shock
which
will
prevent
his
working
for
some
time
he
may
not
feel
like
painting
saints
said
dudley
but
i
should
think
he
was
in
good
form
for
painting
sinners
is
there
no
room
for
a
jezebel
in
your
portrait
gallery
dudley
was
too
weak
for
late
hours
and
hazard
went
away
early
as
he
went
he
said
he
would
come
again
to
tell
them
the
next
chapter
if
there
was
one
be
quick
about
it
said
dudley
i
am
like
the
sultan
who
cut
off
his
wives
heads
because
they
would
not
tell
him
stories
fast
enough
it
is
not
convenient
for
me
to
wait
to
esther
this
evening
was
the
last
when
the
stars
shone
bright
and
clear
the
next
morning
her
glimpse
of
blue
sky
had
vanished
and
the
rigor
of
the
storm
began
she
was
waked
by
the
news
that
in
the
night
her
father
had
been
seized
by
another
paroxysm
and
that
although
better
he
was
excessively
weak
he
had
forbidden
his
attendants
to
call
her
on
the
cool
calculation
that
he
should
probably
pull
through
this
attack
and
that
she
would
need
all
her
strength
for
the
next
when
esther
came
down
to
his
room
she
found
him
in
a
state
of
complete
prostration
so
that
his
doctors
had
forbidden
him
to
speak
or
even
to
listen
they
no
longer
talked
with
him
but
gave
their
orders
to
her
and
she
took
charge
of
the
at
once
with
all
its
responsibilities
and
fatigues
after
a
consultation
of
very
few
moments
the
physicians
told
her
plainly
that
there
was
no
hope
her
father
might
linger
a
short
time
but
any
sudden
emotion
would
kill
him
on
the
spot
during
the
day
he
rallied
a
little
and
in
the
evening
was
stronger
esther
who
had
been
all
day
in
his
room
rested
till
midnight
and
then
took
her
regular
watch
by
his
side
she
knew
that
there
was
no
hope
and
that
her
father
himself
was
only
anxious
for
the
end
yet
to
see
him
suffer
and
slowly
fade
out
was
terrible
at
such
moments
tears
are
forbidden
esther
had
been
told
that
she
must
not
give
way
to
agitation
under
the
risk
of
killing
her
father
who
lay
dozing
with
his
face
turned
towards
her
whenever
his
eyes
opened
they
rested
on
hers
in
the
dim
light
she
watched
his
motions
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
was
also
watching
hers
she
wondered
whether
he
could
feel
stronger
because
she
was
near
him
was
he
afraid
he
who
had
never
to
her
knowledge
shrunk
from
any
danger
and
who
in
the
army
had
shown
reckless
indifference
even
when
he
supposed
his
wounds
to
be
mortal
was
now
watching
her
as
though
he
feared
to
have
her
leave
his
side
in
his
extreme
weakness
unable
to
lift
his
head
his
mind
evidently
beginning
to
wander
perhaps
he
felt
the
need
of
her
companionship
and
dreaded
solitude
and
death
as
she
did
for
half
the
night
she
pondered
over
this
weakening
of
the
will
in
the
face
of
omnipotence
crushing
out
the
last
spark
of
life
and
was
doubly
startled
when
the
nurse
coming
to
relieve
her
at
six
she
leaned
over
to
kiss
her
father
forehead
and
found
him
looking
at
her
in
his
old
humorous
way
while
in
a
low
whisper
speaking
slowly
as
though
he
would
not
yield
to
the
enemy
that
clutched
his
heart
he
said
it
not
so
bad
esther
when
you
come
to
it
the
tears
started
into
esther
eyes
it
was
only
with
an
effort
more
violent
than
she
had
thought
was
in
her
power
that
she
forced
herself
to
smile
now
that
she
had
come
to
it
she
thought
it
was
very
bad
worse
than
any
thing
she
had
ever
imagined
she
wanted
to
escape
to
run
away
to
get
out
of
life
itself
rather
than
suffer
such
pain
such
terror
such
misery
of
helplessness
but
after
an
instant
pause
her
father
whispered
again
though
his
voice
died
away
in
weakness
laugh
esther
when
you
in
trouble
say
something
droll
then
safe
i
saw
the
whole
regiment
laugh
under
fire
at
gettysburg
this
was
more
than
she
could
bear
and
she
had
to
hurry
out
of
the
room
she
had
fancied
him
yielding
to
fear
and
finding
courage
in
her
companionship
suddenly
she
became
aware
that
with
death
hand
on
his
throat
and
a
brain
reeling
in
exhaustion
he
was
trying
to
teach
her
how
to
meet
what
life
had
to
bring
the
lesson
was
one
she
could
not
easily
forget
so
she
went
to
her
bed
in
the
cold
gray
dawn
of
a
winter
day
with
the
tears
still
running
down
her
face
when
she
woke
again
the
day
was
already
waning
a
dripping
wasting
thaw
when
smoking
and
snow
added
sadness
to
the
sad
sky
esther
on
opening
her
eyes
saw
catherine
sitting
quietly
before
the
fire
reading
or
pretending
to
read
she
was
keeping
guard
lest
esther
should
be
disturbed
he
is
no
worse
she
said
when
esther
raised
her
head
i
was
at
his
door
five
minutes
ago
murray
is
there
and
so
is
the
doctor
you
are
not
wanted
and
they
sent
word
that
you
were
not
to
be
disturbed
esther
was
glad
to
lie
still
a
few
minutes
and
collect
her
strength
it
was
pleasant
to
look
at
catherine
the
healthiest
and
most
cheery
of
girls
after
having
under
one
eyes
a
long
night
of
terror
professor
strong
has
been
here
this
morning
and
i
saw
him
ran
on
catherine
he
sent
for
me
because
he
would
not
have
you
disturbed
he
got
back
from
louis
last
night
and
will
come
round
here
again
this
afternoon
mr
hazard
has
been
here
too
and
says
he
shall
stop
again
in
the
evening
this
report
required
no
answer
esther
felt
the
stronger
for
knowing
that
her
friends
were
at
her
side
and
that
she
could
count
on
their
help
catherine
ran
on
in
the
same
vein
mr
hazard
says
that
wharton
has
left
town
and
will
not
return
until
murray
sends
for
him
i
think
he
might
have
left
some
message
for
me
to
ask
me
to
be
true
to
him
or
something
but
mr
hazard
says
he
just
went
off
to
boston
without
a
word
to
any
body
i
have
more
than
half
a
mind
to
desert
him
and
go
back
to
colorado
if
you
leave
me
now
catherine
oh
i
do
mean
to
leave
you
but
i
must
earn
my
living
let
me
take
my
watch
with
your
father
you
will
think
you
have
struck
a
professional
esther
refused
but
catherine
did
rather
more
than
her
share
of
work
notwithstanding
and
more
than
once
dudley
opening
his
eyes
found
her
at
the
head
of
his
bed
and
greeted
her
with
a
faint
smile
he
passed
the
day
without
much
sign
of
change
esther
was
repeatedly
called
from
his
side
to
see
persons
whom
she
could
not
send
away
her
aunt
was
with
her
till
night
strong
came
in
and
sat
with
her
while
she
tried
to
dine
so
long
as
lasted
she
felt
no
sense
of
loneliness
or
desertion
and
her
courage
remained
fairly
steady
but
when
she
had
sent
home
her
aunt
and
cousin
in
order
to
begin
her
watch
earlier
than
the
previous
night
her
fears
returned
her
heart
sank
and
she
begged
catherine
to
stay
with
her
the
two
girls
began
their
watch
together
dudley
seemed
pleased
to
have
them
with
him
presently
a
nurse
came
with
a
message
that
mr
hazard
was
below
and
had
asked
to
see
esther
for
a
moment
dudley
overheard
the
message
and
whispered
to
his
daughter
tell
him
i
am
sorry
not
to
see
him
say
i
am
just
going
out
he
spoke
dreamily
as
though
half
asleep
and
esther
as
she
leaned
over
him
trying
to
catch
his
words
doubted
whether
he
was
quite
conscious
he
muttered
a
few
more
words
i
wo
interfere
but
the
church
she
caught
no
more
and
he
dozed
off
again
into
silence
after
watching
him
a
few
moments
esther
beckoned
to
catherine
to
take
her
chair
and
slipped
out
of
the
room
she
wanted
to
see
hazard
for
strange
as
it
seemed
to
her
he
had
become
her
most
intimate
friend
and
she
could
not
send
him
away
at
such
a
moment
she
found
him
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
there
they
remained
standing
for
a
few
moments
talking
in
low
tones
by
the
light
of
a
dim
i
want
to
help
you
he
said
i
am
used
to
such
scenes
and
you
are
not
you
need
help
though
you
may
not
ask
for
it
she
shook
her
head
i
am
a
miserable
coward
she
said
but
we
are
beyond
help
now
and
i
must
learn
endurance
you
will
your
strength
he
urged
remember
there
is
no
excitement
so
great
as
to
stand
for
the
first
time
in
face
of
eternity
as
you
are
doing
i
suppose
it
must
be
so
she
answered
every
thing
seems
unreal
i
ca
even
realize
my
father
illness
your
voice
sounds
as
though
you
were
calling
to
me
out
of
the
distance
and
darkness
i
hardly
know
what
we
are
saying
or
why
we
are
here
i
never
felt
so
before
it
is
and
fatigue
he
replied
soothingly
do
you
feel
afraid
too
terribly
she
answered
i
want
to
run
away
but
i
think
death
excites
almost
more
than
it
frightens
my
father
laughs
at
it
even
now
i
am
more
concerned
about
you
continued
hazard
i
can
do
nothing
for
him
and
you
may
feel
sure
that
for
him
all
the
worst
is
over
will
you
let
me
stay
here
on
the
chance
of
your
needing
help
i
have
already
sent
away
my
aunt
and
george
strong
she
said
do
not
feel
alarmed
about
me
women
have
more
strength
than
men
as
he
left
the
house
he
thought
to
himself
that
this
woman
at
least
had
more
strength
than
most
men
he
could
not
forget
her
pale
face
or
her
dreamy
voice
and
eyes
as
she
had
told
him
her
feelings
most
women
would
have
asked
him
for
religious
help
and
consolation
she
had
gently
put
his
offers
aside
she
seemed
to
him
like
a
wandering
soul
lost
in
infinite
space
but
still
floating
on
with
her
quiet
air
of
confidence
as
though
she
were
a
part
of
nature
itself
and
felt
that
all
nature
moved
with
her
i
almost
think
said
hazard
to
himself
that
she
could
give
a
lesson
in
strength
to
me
it
seems
rather
unnecessary
my
offering
to
give
one
to
her
yet
esther
felt
little
like
giving
strength
to
any
one
as
she
returned
to
the
and
slipped
back
into
the
chair
which
catherine
quitted
the
image
of
hazard
faded
from
her
mind
and
the
idea
that
he
could
help
her
except
by
his
sympathy
and
friendship
never
entered
it
after
a
time
her
father
opened
his
eyes
again
and
looked
at
her
she
bent
over
him
and
he
whispered
give
me
your
hand
she
took
his
hand
and
for
some
time
he
lay
with
his
eyes
open
as
though
watching
her
she
could
only
wonder
what
was
in
his
mind
perhaps
disconnected
dreams
with
intervals
of
partial
consciousness
as
now
followed
by
more
vague
visions
and
hurrying
phantasms
but
she
imagined
that
he
had
meant
not
so
much
to
ask
for
the
strength
of
her
hand
as
to
give
her
die
will
and
courage
of
his
own
and
she
felt
only
the
wish
that
he
might
not
doubt
her
answer
to
the
call
although
he
soon
dozed
again
she
did
not
alter
her
position
but
sat
hour
after
hour
only
making
way
for
the
nurse
who
came
to
give
him
stimulants
which
had
less
and
less
effect
her
watch
ended
at
two
when
she
sent
catherine
to
bed
but
remained
herself
until
the
gray
dawn
had
passed
and
the
sun
was
high
in
the
heavens
she
meant
her
father
to
know
as
long
as
he
knew
any
thing
that
her
hand
was
in
his
not
until
the
doctor
assured
her
that
he
was
no
longer
conscious
did
her
long
walk
into
the
shadow
of
death
at
last
end
when
murray
came
she
found
esther
still
there
her
face
paler
than
ever
with
dark
rings
round
her
eyes
and
looking
worn
and
old
as
she
spoke
her
eyes
constantly
filled
with
tears
and
her
nerves
were
strung
up
to
a
tension
which
made
her
aunt
promptly
intervene
and
insist
on
her
taking
rest
esther
obeyed
like
a
child
so
died
william
dudley
and
was
buried
under
the
ice
and
snow
of
winter
while
his
daughter
went
on
alone
to
meet
the
buffets
of
life
it
was
in
the
first
days
of
february
that
esther
looked
about
her
and
seemed
to
feel
that
the
world
had
changed
she
said
to
herself
that
youth
was
gone
what
was
she
to
do
with
at
to
be
alone
with
no
one
to
interpose
as
much
as
a
shadow
across
her
path
was
a
strange
sensation
it
made
her
dizzy
as
though
she
were
a
solitary
bird
flying
through
and
as
she
looked
ahead
on
her
aërial
path
could
see
no
tie
more
human
than
that
which
bound
her
to
andromeda
and
orion
to
this
moral
strain
was
added
the
reaction
from
physical
fatigue
for
a
week
or
two
after
her
father
death
esther
felt
languid
weary
and
listless
she
could
not
sleep
a
voice
a
bar
of
music
the
sight
of
any
thing
unusual
affected
her
deeply
she
could
not
get
back
to
her
regular
interests
first
came
the
funeral
with
its
inevitable
depression
and
fatigue
then
came
days
of
vacancy
with
no
appetite
for
work
and
no
chance
for
amusement
she
took
refuge
in
trifles
but
the
needle
and
scissors
are
terrible
weapons
for
cutting
out
and
trimming
not
so
much
women
dresses
as
their
thoughts
she
had
never
been
a
reader
and
perhaps
for
that
reason
her
mind
had
all
the
more
run
into
regions
of
fancy
and
imagination
she
caught
half
an
idea
in
the
air
and
tossed
it
for
amusement
in
these
days
of
unrest
she
tossed
her
ideas
more
rapidly
than
ever
most
women
are
more
or
less
mystical
by
nature
and
esther
had
a
vein
of
mysticism
running
through
a
practical
mind
the
only
person
outside
her
family
whom
she
saw
was
hazard
he
was
either
at
the
house
or
in
some
way
near
her
almost
every
day
he
took
charge
of
the
funeral
services
and
came
to
make
inquiries
to
bring
messages
or
to
suggest
an
occupation
until
he
was
looked
upon
as
one
of
the
household
once
or
twice
the
week
after
the
funeral
he
came
in
the
evening
and
asked
for
a
cup
of
tea
then
catherine
sat
by
and
dozed
while
esther
talked
mysticism
with
hazard
who
was
himself
a
mystic
of
the
purest
water
by
this
time
esther
had
learned
to
look
on
the
physical
life
the
daily
repetition
of
breakfast
and
dinner
as
the
unreal
part
of
existence
and
apologized
to
herself
for
conceding
so
much
to
habit
or
put
it
down
to
catherine
account
her
illusions
were
not
serious
perhaps
she
had
for
this
short
instant
a
flash
of
truth
and
by
the
light
of
her
father
deathbed
saw
life
as
it
is
but
while
the
mood
lasted
nothing
seemed
real
except
the
imagination
and
nothing
true
but
the
spiritual
in
this
atmosphere
hazard
was
always
happy
for
he
reveled
in
the
voluptuousness
of
poetry
and
found
peace
in
the
soul
of
a
dandelion
but
to
share
his
subtlest
fancies
with
a
woman
who
could
understand
and
feel
them
was
to
reach
a
height
of
poetry
that
trembled
on
the
verge
of
realizing
heaven
his
great
eyes
shone
with
the
radiance
of
paradise
and
his
delicate
thin
features
expressed
beatitude
as
he
discussed
with
esther
the
purity
of
the
soul
the
victory
of
spirit
over
matter
and
the
peace
of
infinite
love
of
her
regular
occupations
esther
kept
up
only
such
as
were
duties
but
among
them
she
was
true
to
her
little
hospital
and
went
once
or
twice
a
week
to
see
the
children
who
clamored
for
her
visits
she
went
alone
for
she
liked
solitude
and
was
glad
to
give
catherine
an
excuse
for
escaping
to
gayer
houses
and
seeing
brighter
society
about
a
fortnight
after
her
father
death
one
saturday
afternoon
when
she
felt
more
solitary
than
ever
and
more
restless
because
her
long
quiet
had
begun
to
bring
back
her
strength
she
went
to
the
hospital
where
the
children
welcomed
her
with
delight
she
took
her
old
seat
and
looked
through
the
yellow
eyes
of
the
for
inspiration
opened
a
package
and
distributed
small
presents
little
japanese
umbrellas
fans
shoes
and
such
small
change
of
popularity
and
at
last
obeying
the
cries
for
more
story
she
went
on
with
the
history
of
princess
lovely
in
her
cocoanut
island
besieged
by
whales
and
defended
by
talking
elephants
and
monkeys
she
had
hardly
begun
when
the
door
opened
and
again
mr
hazard
entered
this
time
esther
blushed
hazard
sat
down
and
finding
that
she
soon
tired
of
he
took
it
up
and
gave
a
chapter
of
his
own
which
had
wild
success
so
that
the
children
begged
for
more
and
more
until
five
was
past
and
twilight
coming
on
as
esther
was
on
foot
mr
hazard
said
he
would
see
her
to
her
door
and
they
walked
away
together
do
you
know
that
wharton
has
come
back
said
he
as
they
reached
the
street
his
affair
is
settled
the
woman
sailed
yesterday
for
europe
and
he
is
to
have
a
divorce
your
uncle
has
managed
it
very
well
will
wharton
go
to
work
again
at
the
church
asked
esther
he
begins
at
once
he
asked
me
to
find
out
for
him
whether
you
would
begin
with
him
did
he
say
whether
he
wanted
me
or
catherine
asked
esther
with
a
laugh
hazard
laughed
in
reply
i
think
myself
he
would
be
satisfied
to
get
miss
brooke
but
you
must
not
underrate
your
own
merits
he
wants
you
both
i
am
afraid
he
must
give
us
up
said
esther
with
a
little
sigh
certainly
i
ca
come
and
if
he
wants
catherine
he
will
have
to
come
himself
and
get
her
but
he
will
find
catherine
not
easy
to
get
they
discussed
wharton
and
his
affairs
till
they
reached
esther
house
and
she
said
it
is
not
yet
six
i
can
give
you
a
cup
of
tea
if
you
will
come
in
she
could
not
do
less
than
offer
him
this
small
hospitality
and
yet
catherine
was
not
at
home
they
went
up
to
the
library
and
esther
ordered
tea
to
be
brought
she
took
off
her
bonnet
and
cloak
and
threw
them
on
a
chair
she
sat
down
before
the
fire
and
he
stood
on
the
looking
at
her
while
she
made
tea
in
the
twilight
at
this
moment
he
was
more
hopelessly
in
love
than
any
other
church
of
england
clergyman
within
the
diocese
of
new
york
what
are
then
your
plans
for
the
future
he
asked
after
they
had
chatted
for
some
time
on
the
subject
of
esther
painting
if
you
will
not
return
to
help
us
what
do
you
look
forward
to
doing
i
want
to
take
catherine
and
go
abroad
answered
esther
if
i
can
get
my
uncle
and
aunt
to
go
we
shall
start
in
the
spring
at
this
announcement
hazard
seemed
to
receive
a
shock
he
turned
suddenly
to
her
his
eyes
sparkling
with
passion
take
me
with
you
what
shall
i
do
without
you
he
seized
her
hand
and
poured
out
a
torrent
of
broken
protests
i
love
you
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
do
leave
me
alone
in
this
horrible
city
i
shall
die
of
disgust
if
you
desert
me
you
are
the
only
woman
i
ever
loved
ah
you
must
love
me
esther
trembling
bewildered
carried
away
by
this
sudden
and
violent
attack
made
at
first
a
feeble
effort
to
withdraw
her
hand
and
to
gasp
a
protest
but
the
traitor
within
her
own
breast
was
worse
than
the
enemy
without
for
the
moment
all
her
wise
resolutions
were
swept
away
in
a
wave
of
tenderness
she
seemed
to
come
suddenly
on
a
summer
sea
sparkling
with
hope
and
sunshine
the
dreary
of
her
old
life
vanishing
like
a
dream
she
shut
her
eyes
and
found
herself
in
his
arms
then
in
terror
at
what
she
had
done
she
tried
again
to
draw
back
no
no
she
said
rapidly
trying
to
free
herself
you
must
not
love
me
you
must
let
me
go
i
love
you
i
adore
you
i
will
never
let
you
go
you
must
you
do
not
know
what
you
are
doing
ah
let
me
go
tell
me
first
that
you
love
me
no
no
i
am
not
good
enough
for
you
you
must
love
some
one
who
has
her
heart
in
your
work
tell
me
that
you
love
me
repeated
hazard
you
do
not
know
me
you
must
not
love
me
i
shall
ruin
your
life
i
shall
never
satisfy
you
hazard
caressed
her
only
the
more
tenderly
as
he
answered
with
the
which
he
put
into
all
he
did
if
my
calling
is
so
poor
a
thing
that
it
can
not
satisfy
both
our
lives
i
will
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
it
i
have
more
faith
in
us
both
promise
to
love
me
and
i
will
take
care
of
the
rest
ah
gasped
esther
carried
away
by
her
own
feelings
and
the
vehemence
of
his
love
i
am
getting
in
deeper
and
deeper
what
shall
i
do
do
not
make
me
promise
then
i
will
promise
for
both
he
said
and
poor
esther
ceased
to
struggle
the
same
evening
at
dinner
murray
remarked
to
her
husband
that
she
was
becoming
more
and
more
uneasy
about
esther
intimacy
with
mr
hazard
people
are
talking
about
it
she
said
it
is
really
becoming
a
matter
of
public
discussion
do
you
suppose
she
would
accept
him
asked
murray
how
can
i
tell
she
would
say
no
and
then
very
likely
do
it
she
is
in
the
worst
sort
of
a
state
of
mind
for
an
offer
of
that
kind
poor
dudley
will
rise
from
his
grave
said
murray
he
warned
me
to
prevent
such
a
match
if
i
saw
it
coming
said
murray
but
he
did
nothing
to
prevent
it
himself
he
thought
esther
was
going
to
be
very
unhappy
and
would
make
some
such
mistake
i
would
interfere
but
it
will
only
make
matters
worse
the
thing
has
gone
too
far
now
take
her
away
said
murray
where
to
if
you
will
go
to
europe
in
the
spring
we
will
take
her
over
and
leave
her
there
with
catherine
but
she
may
be
married
by
that
time
give
her
a
lecture
said
murray
show
her
that
she
is
making
a
stupendous
blunder
better
show
him
said
murray
with
a
little
resentment
the
blunder
will
be
worse
for
him
than
for
her
explain
it
to
her
said
he
she
has
sense
esther
is
a
good
girl
and
i
wo
stand
by
and
see
her
throw
herself
away
on
a
church
i
will
speak
to
her
myself
if
you
do
a
nice
piece
of
work
you
would
make
of
it
rejoined
his
wife
no
if
it
is
to
be
done
i
suppose
i
must
do
it
but
she
will
hate
me
all
her
life
do
it
at
once
then
said
murray
the
longer
you
put
it
off
the
worse
she
will
take
it
i
will
talk
with
her
replied
murray
and
the
next
day
when
she
went
to
take
esther
to
drive
in
the
afternoon
her
niece
received
her
with
an
embarrassed
air
and
a
high
color
and
said
aunt
i
have
something
to
tell
you
good
heavens
gasped
murray
i
am
engaged
to
mr
hazard
the
instant
esther
felt
herself
really
loved
she
met
her
fate
as
women
will
when
the
shock
is
once
over
hazard
had
wanted
her
to
love
him
had
pursued
and
caught
her
now
when
she
turned
to
him
and
answered
his
call
she
seemed
to
take
possession
of
him
and
lift
him
up
by
the
time
he
left
her
house
this
saturday
evening
he
felt
that
he
had
found
a
soul
stronger
and
warmer
than
his
own
and
was
already
a
little
afraid
of
it
every
man
who
has
at
last
succeeded
after
long
effort
in
calling
up
the
divinity
which
lies
hidden
in
a
woman
heart
is
startled
to
find
that
he
must
obey
the
god
he
summoned
esther
herself
was
more
astonished
than
hazard
at
the
force
of
this
feeling
which
swept
her
away
she
suddenly
found
herself
passionately
attached
to
a
man
whom
down
to
the
last
moment
she
had
thought
she
could
never
marry
and
now
could
no
more
imagine
life
without
him
than
she
could
conceive
of
loving
any
one
else
for
the
moment
she
thought
that
his
profession
was
nothing
to
her
she
could
believe
whatever
he
believed
and
do
whatever
he
did
and
if
her
love
backed
by
her
will
were
not
strong
enough
to
make
his
life
her
own
she
cared
little
what
became
of
her
and
could
look
with
indifference
on
life
itself
so
far
as
she
was
concerned
she
thought
herself
ready
to
worship
woden
or
thor
if
he
did
the
next
morning
she
could
not
let
him
preach
without
being
near
him
and
she
made
catherine
go
with
her
to
john
they
took
their
seats
not
in
her
own
pew
but
in
a
corner
where
no
one
should
notice
them
under
their
veils
the
experiment
was
full
of
peril
though
esther
did
not
know
it
this
new
excitement
coming
so
swiftly
after
a
fortnight
of
exhaustion
threw
her
back
into
a
state
of
extreme
nervousness
of
course
the
scene
of
saturday
evening
was
followed
by
a
sleepless
night
and
when
sunday
morning
came
her
very
restlessness
made
her
hope
that
she
should
find
repose
and
calm
within
the
walls
of
the
church
she
went
believing
that
she
needed
nothing
so
much
as
the
quieting
influence
of
the
service
and
she
was
not
disappointed
for
her
sweetest
associations
were
here
and
as
she
glanced
timidly
up
to
the
scaffolding
where
her
romance
had
been
acted
she
felt
at
home
and
happy
in
spite
of
the
crowd
of
people
who
swarmed
about
her
and
separated
her
from
the
things
she
loved
in
the
background
stood
the
solemn
and
awful
associations
of
the
last
few
weeks
the
mysteries
and
terrors
of
death
drawing
her
from
thought
of
earthly
things
to
visions
of
another
world
full
of
these
deep
feelings
saturated
with
the
elixir
of
love
esther
succumbed
to
the
first
notes
of
the
church
music
tears
of
peaceful
delight
stood
in
her
eyes
she
glanced
up
towards
her
cecilia
on
the
distant
wall
wondering
at
its
childishness
how
deep
a
meaning
she
could
give
it
now
and
how
religious
a
feeling
she
was
not
conscious
of
rustling
silks
or
waving
feathers
she
hardly
saw
the
swarm
of
fashionable
people
about
her
it
seemed
to
her
that
her
old
life
had
vanished
as
though
she
were
dead
her
soul
might
have
taken
shelter
in
the
body
of
some
gray
linnet
for
all
that
she
thought
or
cared
about
the
vanities
of
human
society
she
wanted
only
to
be
loved
and
to
love
without
being
thought
of
or
noticed
to
nestle
in
her
own
corner
and
let
the
world
go
by
unluckily
the
world
would
not
go
by
this
world
which
she
wanted
to
keep
at
arms
length
was
at
church
once
for
all
and
meant
to
stay
there
it
felt
itself
at
home
and
she
with
her
exclusive
griefs
and
joys
was
the
stranger
so
long
as
the
music
lasted
all
was
sympathetic
enough
but
when
mr
hazard
read
the
service
he
seemed
and
strange
he
belonged
not
to
her
but
to
the
world
a
thousand
people
had
rights
of
property
in
him
soul
and
body
and
called
their
claim
religion
what
had
she
to
do
with
it
parts
of
the
service
jarred
on
her
ear
she
began
to
take
a
bitter
pleasure
in
thinking
that
she
had
nothing
not
even
religious
ideas
in
common
with
these
people
who
came
between
her
and
her
lover
her
fatigue
steadily
worked
on
her
nerves
by
the
time
the
creed
was
read
she
could
not
honestly
feel
that
she
believed
a
word
of
it
or
could
force
herself
to
say
that
she
ever
should
believe
it
with
fading
she
listened
to
the
sermon
it
was
beautiful
simple
full
of
feeling
and
even
of
passion
but
she
felt
that
it
was
made
for
her
and
she
shrank
before
the
thousand
people
who
were
thus
let
into
the
secret
chambers
of
her
heart
it
treated
of
death
and
its
mystery
covering
ignorance
with
a
veil
of
religious
hope
and
ending
with
an
invocation
of
infinite
love
so
intense
in
feeling
and
expression
that
beautiful
as
it
was
esther
forgot
its
beauties
in
the
fear
that
the
next
word
would
reveal
her
to
the
world
this
sort
of
publicity
was
new
to
her
and
threw
her
back
on
herself
until
religion
was
forgotten
in
the
alarm
she
became
more
jealous
than
ever
what
business
had
these
strangers
with
her
love
why
should
she
share
it
with
them
when
the
service
was
over
she
hurried
catherine
away
so
quickly
that
they
were
both
at
home
before
the
church
was
fairly
empty
this
was
the
end
of
her
short
happiness
she
knew
that
through
the
church
door
lay
the
only
road
to
her
duty
and
peace
of
mind
to
see
that
the
first
happy
impression
had
lasted
barely
half
an
hour
and
instead
of
bringing
peace
had
brought
irritation
was
cause
enough
to
alarm
the
most
courageous
young
woman
who
ever
rushed
into
the
maelstrom
of
matrimony
when
they
had
reached
home
she
flung
herself
into
a
chair
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
catherine
said
she
solemnly
what
am
i
to
do
i
do
like
church
you
would
like
your
amazingly
said
catherine
if
you
had
ever
been
to
mine
was
your
worse
if
murray
had
improved
my
manners
so
much
i
should
smile
was
mine
worse
i
wish
you
and
mr
hazard
would
try
it
for
a
change
dyer
would
like
to
see
you
both
undergoing
discipline
never
joke
about
serious
matters
you
had
better
hold
your
tongue
and
be
glad
to
live
in
a
place
where
your
friends
let
your
soul
alone
but
i
ca
sit
still
and
hear
myself
turned
into
a
show
i
ca
share
him
with
all
fifth
avenue
i
want
no
one
else
to
have
him
to
see
him
there
devoting
himself
and
me
to
a
stupid
crowd
of
people
who
have
as
much
right
to
him
as
i
have
drives
religion
out
of
my
head
catherine
treated
this
weakness
with
high
contempt
i
might
as
well
be
jealous
said
she
of
the
people
who
look
at
wharton
pictures
or
read
petrarch
sonnets
in
my
sweet
translation
did
you
ever
hear
that
laura
found
fault
with
petrarch
or
if
she
did
that
any
one
believed
she
was
in
earnest
it
is
not
the
same
thing
said
esther
he
believes
in
his
church
more
than
he
does
in
me
if
i
ca
believe
in
it
he
will
have
to
give
me
up
he
give
you
up
said
catherine
the
poor
saint
you
know
he
is
silly
about
you
he
must
give
me
up
if
i
am
jealous
of
his
congregation
and
believe
what
he
preaches
replied
esther
mournfully
why
should
you
care
what
he
preaches
asked
catherine
you
never
heard
your
aunt
troubling
her
head
about
what
murray
says
when
he
goes
to
court
she
is
not
forced
to
go
to
court
with
him
said
esther
nor
to
be
a
mother
to
all
the
old
women
in
the
nor
to
say
that
she
believes
believes
believes
when
in
her
heart
she
does
believe
a
word
hazard
appeared
in
the
middle
of
this
dispute
and
esther
troubled
as
she
was
could
not
bear
to
distress
him
she
still
meant
to
accept
every
thing
and
force
herself
to
follow
him
in
silence
she
would
go
where
he
led
and
never
once
raise
her
eyes
to
look
for
the
horizon
as
she
said
to
herself
quite
seriously
though
with
a
want
of
reverence
that
augured
ill
i
will
go
down
on
my
knees
and
help
him
though
he
turn
bonze
and
burn
incense
to
buddha
in
my
very
studio
his
presence
always
soothed
her
his
gayety
and
affection
never
failed
to
revive
her
spirits
and
confidence
was
it
a
good
sermon
said
he
to
catherine
as
he
came
in
with
his
boyish
laugh
of
triumph
give
me
a
little
praise
i
never
got
a
word
of
encouragement
from
you
in
my
life
i
should
as
soon
think
of
encouraging
a
whole
herd
of
texas
cattle
answered
catherine
what
good
can
my
praise
do
you
you
child
of
nature
do
you
know
that
children
of
nature
like
you
always
grow
wild
and
need
no
cultivation
but
that
we
artificial
flowers
ca
live
without
it
i
do
know
how
to
cultivate
answered
catherine
it
is
esther
you
are
thinking
about
having
announced
this
fact
catherine
walked
off
and
left
him
to
quiet
esther
alarms
as
he
could
as
she
went
she
heard
him
turn
to
esther
and
repeat
his
prayer
that
she
should
be
gentle
with
him
and
give
his
sermon
a
word
of
praise
how
can
i
stop
to
think
whether
it
is
good
or
not
said
esther
when
i
hear
you
telling
all
our
secrets
to
our
whole
visiting
list
i
could
think
of
nothing
but
myself
and
how
i
could
get
away
and
whose
secrets
can
i
tell
if
not
our
own
asked
hazard
triumphant
while
he
was
with
her
esther
was
peaceful
and
happy
but
no
sooner
had
he
gone
than
her
terrors
began
again
he
will
find
me
out
catherine
and
it
will
break
my
heart
she
said
i
never
knew
i
had
a
jealous
temper
i
am
horribly
not
fit
for
him
and
i
knew
it
when
he
asked
me
he
will
hate
me
when
he
finds
what
a
wife
he
has
got
catherine
who
positively
declined
to
recognize
mr
hazard
superiority
of
mind
over
esther
took
this
with
unshaken
fortitude
if
you
can
stand
it
i
guess
he
can
she
remarked
curtly
where
do
you
expect
the
poor
man
to
get
a
wife
if
all
of
us
say
we
are
not
fit
for
him
this
view
of
the
case
amused
esther
for
a
time
but
not
for
long
the
matter
was
too
serious
for
any
treatment
but
a
joke
and
joking
made
it
more
serious
still
try
which
way
she
would
there
was
no
escape
from
her
anxiety
hazard
who
had
foreseen
some
trouble
from
her
old
associations
with
loose
religious
opinion
had
taken
it
for
granted
with
his
usual
that
from
the
moment
she
came
within
the
reach
of
his
faith
and
took
a
place
by
his
side
she
would
find
no
difficulties
that
he
could
not
easily
overcome
love
is
the
great
magnet
of
life
and
religion
he
said
is
love
nothing
could
be
simpler
than
his
plan
as
he
explained
to
her
she
had
but
to
trust
herself
to
him
and
all
was
sure
to
go
well
so
long
as
he
was
with
her
and
could
gently
thrust
aside
every
idea
but
that
of
their
own
happiness
all
went
as
well
as
he
promised
but
unluckily
for
his
plan
esther
had
all
her
life
been
used
to
act
for
herself
and
to
order
others
rather
than
take
orders
of
any
sort
the
more
confidently
hazard
told
her
to
leave
every
thing
to
him
the
less
it
occurred
to
her
to
do
so
she
could
no
more
allow
him
to
come
into
her
life
and
take
charge
of
her
thoughts
than
to
go
down
into
her
kitchen
and
take
charge
of
her
cook
he
might
reason
with
her
by
the
hour
and
quite
convince
her
that
nothing
was
of
the
least
consequence
provided
it
were
left
entirely
in
his
hands
but
the
moment
he
was
out
of
sight
she
forgot
that
he
was
to
be
the
keeper
of
her
conscience
and
without
a
thought
of
her
dependence
she
resumed
the
charge
of
her
own
affairs
her
first
idea
was
to
learn
something
of
theology
in
the
hope
of
settling
her
foolish
and
ignorant
doubts
as
to
her
fitness
for
her
new
position
no
sooner
did
the
thought
occur
to
her
than
she
set
to
work
like
a
young
divinity
student
to
fit
herself
for
her
new
calling
her
father
library
contained
a
number
of
theological
books
but
these
were
of
a
kind
that
suited
dudley
way
of
thinking
rather
than
that
of
the
early
fathers
as
esther
knew
nothing
at
all
about
the
subject
except
what
she
had
gathered
from
listening
to
conversation
one
book
seemed
to
her
as
good
as
another
provided
it
dealt
with
the
matter
that
interested
her
but
when
hazard
came
in
and
found
her
seated
on
a
sofa
with
a
pile
of
these
works
about
her
his
hair
rose
on
end
and
he
was
forced
gently
to
take
them
away
under
the
promise
of
bringing
her
others
of
a
more
correct
kind
these
in
their
turn
seemed
to
her
not
quite
clear
and
she
asked
for
others
still
he
found
himself
without
warning
on
the
brink
of
a
theological
abyss
unwilling
to
worry
him
eager
to
accept
whatever
he
told
her
he
believed
but
in
despair
at
each
failure
to
understand
what
it
was
esther
became
more
and
more
uncomfortable
and
terrified
what
would
you
do
catherine
if
you
were
in
my
place
she
asked
let
it
alone
said
catherine
you
did
ask
him
to
marry
you
if
he
wants
you
it
his
business
to
suit
himself
to
you
but
i
must
go
to
his
church
said
esther
and
sit
at
his
communion
how
many
people
at
his
church
could
tell
you
what
they
believe
asked
catherine
your
religion
is
just
as
good
as
theirs
as
long
as
you
know
what
it
is
one
learns
theology
fast
when
one
is
engaged
to
be
married
said
esther
with
a
repentant
face
she
was
already
sorry
that
she
had
tried
to
learn
any
thing
about
the
subject
for
she
already
knew
too
much
and
yet
a
terrible
fascination
impelled
her
to
read
on
about
the
nature
of
the
trinity
and
the
authority
of
tradition
until
she
lost
patience
with
her
own
stupidity
and
burned
to
know
what
other
people
had
to
say
on
such
matters
it
occurred
to
her
that
she
should
like
to
have
a
quiet
talk
with
george
strong
meanwhile
murray
at
learning
the
engagement
had
sent
at
once
for
george
the
messenger
reached
him
on
sunday
evening
a
few
hours
after
esther
told
her
aunt
mystified
by
the
urgent
tone
of
murray
note
strong
came
up
at
once
and
found
his
uncle
and
aunt
alone
after
dinner
in
their
parlor
where
murray
was
quietly
smoking
a
cigar
while
his
wife
was
holding
a
book
in
her
hand
and
looking
hard
into
the
fire
george
said
his
aunt
solemnly
do
you
know
the
mischief
you
and
your
friends
have
done
strong
stared
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
that
catherine
has
run
off
with
wharton
said
he
she
ca
have
done
it
for
i
left
wharton
not
fifteen
minutes
ago
at
the
club
no
not
that
thank
heaven
though
if
she
had
more
head
than
ever
he
had
that
french
wife
of
his
might
have
given
her
more
unhappiness
than
he
is
worth
no
it
not
that
catherine
is
the
only
sensible
creature
in
the
family
strong
glared
into
the
fire
for
a
moment
with
a
troubled
air
and
then
looked
at
his
aunt
again
no
said
he
esther
has
joined
the
church
it
ca
be
yes
said
murray
grimly
caramba
growled
strong
with
a
profusion
of
spanish
gutturals
then
after
a
moment
reflection
he
added
poor
child
why
should
i
care
you
irritate
me
more
than
your
uncle
does
broke
out
murray
at
last
losing
patience
do
you
think
i
should
be
so
distressed
if
esther
had
only
joined
the
church
i
should
like
nothing
better
what
has
happened
is
very
different
she
is
engaged
to
mr
hazard
strong
broke
into
a
laugh
and
murray
with
a
quiet
chuckle
of
humor
took
his
cigar
out
of
his
mouth
to
say
let
me
explain
this
little
matter
to
you
george
what
troubles
your
aunt
is
not
so
much
that
esther
has
joined
the
church
as
that
she
fears
the
church
has
joined
esther
the
church
has
struck
it
rich
this
time
remarked
strong
without
a
sign
of
his
first
alarm
now
we
see
what
they
make
of
her
the
matter
is
too
serious
for
joking
said
murray
either
esther
will
be
unhappy
for
life
or
mr
hazard
will
leave
his
church
or
they
will
both
be
miserable
whatever
they
do
i
think
you
are
bound
to
prevent
it
since
you
are
the
one
most
to
blame
for
getting
them
into
it
i
do
want
to
prevent
it
replied
strong
it
a
case
of
survival
for
the
fittest
if
hazard
can
manage
to
convert
esther
let
him
do
it
if
not
let
her
take
him
in
charge
and
convert
him
if
she
can
i
not
interfere
that
is
just
the
remark
i
had
the
honor
to
make
to
your
aunt
as
you
came
in
said
murray
yesterday
i
wanted
to
stop
it
i
want
to
leave
it
alone
they
are
both
of
them
old
enough
to
manage
their
own
case
it
has
risen
now
to
the
dignity
of
a
great
cause
and
i
will
be
the
devil
advocate
you
are
both
of
you
intolerable
said
murray
impatiently
you
talk
about
the
happiness
of
esther
life
as
though
it
were
a
game
of
poker
tell
me
george
what
kind
of
a
man
is
mr
hazard
at
heart
hazard
is
a
priest
at
heart
replied
strong
he
has
the
qualities
and
faults
of
his
class
i
understand
how
this
thing
happened
he
sees
nothing
good
in
the
world
that
he
does
not
instantly
covet
for
the
glory
of
god
and
the
church
and
just
a
bit
for
his
own
pleasure
he
saw
esther
she
struck
him
as
something
out
of
his
line
for
he
is
used
to
young
women
who
work
he
found
that
wharton
and
i
liked
her
he
thought
that
such
material
was
too
good
for
heathen
like
us
so
he
fell
in
love
with
her
himself
and
means
to
turn
her
into
a
candlestick
of
the
church
i
do
mind
let
him
try
he
has
done
what
he
liked
with
us
all
his
life
i
have
worked
like
a
dog
for
him
and
his
church
because
he
was
my
friend
now
he
will
see
whether
he
has
met
his
match
i
double
you
up
all
round
on
esther
you
men
are
simply
brutal
said
his
aunt
esther
will
be
an
unhappy
woman
all
her
life
whether
she
marries
him
or
not
and
you
sit
there
and
will
not
raise
a
finger
to
help
her
let
him
convert
her
i
say
repeated
strong
what
is
your
objection
to
that
aunt
sarah
my
objection
is
that
the
whole
family
is
only
a
drove
of
mules
said
murray
poor
mr
hazard
does
not
know
what
he
is
undertaking
is
esther
very
much
in
love
asked
strong
you
know
her
well
enough
to
know
that
she
would
never
have
accepted
him
if
she
were
not
replied
murray
he
has
hunted
her
down
when
she
was
unhappy
and
he
is
going
to
make
her
more
unhappy
still
i
guess
you
right
said
strong
seriously
the
struggle
is
going
to
tear
both
their
poor
little
hearts
out
but
what
can
we
do
about
it
none
of
us
are
to
blame
ah
george
exclaimed
his
aunt
you
are
the
one
most
to
blame
you
should
have
married
esther
yourself
and
you
had
not
wit
enough
to
see
that
while
you
went
dancing
round
the
world
as
though
such
women
were
plenty
as
your
old
fossil
toads
the
only
woman
you
will
ever
meet
who
could
have
made
you
happy
was
slipping
through
your
fingers
and
you
had
the
strength
to
hold
her
i
own
it
aunt
sarah
said
george
and
this
time
he
spoke
seriously
enough
to
satisfy
her
if
i
could
have
fallen
in
love
with
esther
and
she
with
me
i
believe
it
would
have
been
better
for
both
of
us
than
that
she
should
marry
a
parson
and
i
go
on
digging
bones
but
some
things
are
too
obvious
you
ca
get
a
spark
without
some
break
in
your
conductor
i
was
ready
enough
to
fall
in
love
with
esther
but
one
ca
do
that
kind
of
thing
in
cold
blood
well
said
murray
with
a
sigh
you
have
lost
her
now
and
mr
hazard
will
lose
her
too
you
and
he
and
all
your
friends
are
a
sort
of
clever
children
we
are
always
expecting
you
to
do
something
worth
doing
and
it
never
comes
you
are
a
sort
of
geniuses
just
big
enough
and
strong
enough
to
want
to
do
something
and
never
carry
it
through
i
am
heartily
tired
of
the
whole
lot
of
you
and
now
i
must
set
to
work
and
get
these
two
girls
out
of
your
hands
do
you
mean
to
break
up
this
engagement
asked
strong
who
was
used
to
his
aunt
criticisms
and
never
answered
them
the
engagement
will
break
itself
up
replied
his
aunt
it
will
have
to
be
kept
private
for
a
few
weeks
on
account
of
her
father
death
and
her
mourning
and
you
will
see
that
it
never
will
be
announced
if
i
can
i
shall
certainly
do
all
in
my
power
to
break
it
up
you
will
said
strong
well
i
mean
to
do
just
the
contrary
if
esther
wants
hazard
she
shall
have
him
if
i
can
help
her
why
not
hazard
is
a
good
fellow
and
will
make
her
a
good
husband
i
have
no
fault
to
find
with
him
except
that
he
poaches
outside
his
preserves
he
has
poached
this
time
to
some
purpose
but
if
the
parish
can
stand
it
i
can
the
parish
can
not
stand
it
said
murray
they
are
saying
very
ugly
things
already
about
esther
then
it
will
not
hurt
my
feelings
to
see
hazard
snub
his
congregation
replied
strong
angrily
the
family
conclave
ended
here
and
all
parties
henceforward
fixed
their
eyes
intently
on
the
drama
murray
waited
with
a
woman
instinct
for
her
moment
to
come
strong
tried
to
counteract
her
influence
by
bungling
efforts
to
make
the
lovers
path
smooth
catherine
was
a
sort
of
cushion
against
which
all
the
billiard
balls
of
the
game
knocked
themselves
in
succession
leaving
her
cool
and
elastic
temper
undisturbed
three
more
days
passed
without
throwing
much
new
light
on
the
disputed
question
whether
the
engagement
could
last
except
that
esther
seemed
clearly
more
anxious
and
restless
mr
hazard
was
with
her
several
hours
every
day
and
watched
over
her
with
extreme
vigilance
murray
took
her
to
drive
every
afternoon
and
not
a
glance
of
esther
eyes
escaped
scrutiny
strong
stopped
once
or
twice
at
the
house
but
had
no
chance
to
interfere
until
on
thursday
morning
his
aunt
told
him
that
esther
was
rapidly
getting
into
a
state
of
mind
that
must
soon
bring
on
a
crisis
she
can
not
possibly
make
it
do
said
murray
she
is
worrying
herself
to
death
already
mr
hazard
ought
to
see
that
she
ca
marry
him
she
will
marry
him
answered
strong
coolly
three
women
out
of
four
think
they
ca
marry
a
man
at
first
but
when
they
come
to
parting
with
him
they
learn
better
he
is
passably
selfish
your
mr
hazard
if
he
thought
a
little
more
of
his
parish
he
would
not
want
to
put
over
them
a
woman
like
esther
who
has
not
a
quality
suited
to
the
place
her
qualities
are
excellent
contradicted
strong
once
in
harness
she
will
be
kind
and
gentle
a
little
perhaps
and
apt
to
shy
at
first
but
he
is
quite
right
to
take
her
if
he
can
get
her
and
what
does
his
parish
expect
to
do
about
it
the
first
thing
they
will
do
about
it
will
be
to
make
esther
miserable
they
have
begun
to
gossip
already
a
young
man
even
though
he
is
a
clergyman
ca
be
seen
always
in
company
with
a
pretty
woman
without
exciting
remark
only
yesterday
i
was
asked
whether
my
niece
was
engaged
to
mr
hazard
what
did
you
say
i
told
a
lie
of
course
all
the
meaner
because
it
was
an
equivocation
i
said
that
mr
hazard
had
not
honored
me
with
any
communication
on
the
subject
i
score
up
this
first
falsehood
to
his
account
if
you
lie
no
better
than
that
aunt
sarah
hazard
conscience
trouble
him
much
when
is
the
engagement
to
be
out
very
soon
at
this
rate
i
thought
that
esther
in
common
decency
could
not
announce
it
for
a
week
or
two
but
every
one
already
suspects
it
and
she
will
have
to
make
it
public
within
another
week
if
she
means
to
do
so
at
all
now
that
she
is
her
own
mistress
and
lives
by
herself
she
ca
have
men
so
much
about
the
house
as
she
might
if
her
father
were
living
do
you
seriously
think
she
will
break
it
off
asked
strong
incredulously
i
feel
surer
than
ever
answered
his
aunt
the
criticism
is
going
to
be
bitter
and
the
longer
esther
waits
the
more
sharply
people
will
talk
i
should
not
wonder
if
it
ended
by
driving
mr
hazard
out
of
the
parish
he
is
not
strong
enough
to
shock
them
much
then
esther
is
growing
more
and
more
nervous
every
day
because
the
more
she
tries
to
understand
the
less
she
succeeds
yesterday
when
i
took
her
to
drive
she
was
in
tears
about
the
atonement
and
i
suppose
she
will
have
gone
to
bed
with
a
sick
headache
on
account
of
the
athanasian
creed
i
must
talk
with
her
said
strong
i
think
i
can
make
some
of
those
things
easier
for
her
you
i
thought
you
laughed
at
them
all
so
i
do
but
not
because
they
ca
be
understood
the
trouble
is
that
i
think
i
do
understand
them
mystery
for
mystery
science
beats
religion
hollow
i
ca
open
my
mouth
in
my
without
repeating
ten
times
as
many
unintelligible
formulas
as
ever
hazard
is
forced
to
do
in
his
church
i
can
quiet
her
mind
on
that
score
you
had
better
leave
it
alone
george
why
should
you
meddle
let
mr
hazard
fight
his
own
battles
george
refused
to
take
this
wise
advice
he
was
a
fellow
and
could
not
bear
to
see
his
friends
suffer
if
esther
loved
hazard
and
wanted
to
marry
him
she
should
do
so
though
every
dogma
of
the
church
stood
in
her
way
and
every
old
woman
in
the
parish
shrieked
sacrilege
strong
had
no
respect
for
the
church
and
no
wish
to
save
it
trouble
but
he
believed
that
hazard
was
going
blindly
under
esther
influence
which
would
sooner
or
later
end
by
drawing
him
away
from
his
old
forms
of
belief
and
as
this
was
entirely
hazard
affair
if
he
chose
to
risk
the
danger
strong
chose
to
help
him
why
not
said
strong
to
himself
it
is
not
a
question
of
earning
a
living
both
of
them
are
well
enough
off
if
he
can
turn
her
into
a
light
of
his
church
let
him
do
it
if
she
ends
in
dragging
him
out
of
the
church
so
much
the
better
she
ca
get
a
better
husband
and
he
ca
find
a
better
wife
i
mean
to
see
this
thing
through
so
george
strolled
round
to
esther
house
after
this
interview
with
his
aunt
thinking
that
he
might
be
able
to
do
good
being
at
home
there
he
went
unannounced
and
finding
no
one
in
the
library
he
climbed
to
the
studio
where
on
opening
the
door
he
saw
catherine
sitting
before
the
fire
looking
very
much
bored
poor
catherine
found
it
hard
to
keep
up
with
life
in
new
york
fresh
from
the
prairie
she
had
been
first
saturated
with
art
and
was
now
plunged
in
a
bottomless
ocean
of
theology
she
was
glad
to
see
strong
who
had
in
her
eyes
the
advantage
of
being
more
practical
than
the
rest
of
her
friends
catherine
how
are
your
sheep
i
am
glad
you
have
come
to
look
after
them
answered
catherine
i
wo
be
much
longer
they
are
too
troublesome
what
mischief
are
they
doing
now
every
thing
they
can
think
of
to
worry
me
esther
wo
eat
and
sleep
and
mr
hazard
wo
sleep
and
ca
eat
she
tries
not
to
worry
him
so
she
comes
down
on
me
with
questions
and
books
enough
to
frighten
a
professor
do
tell
me
what
to
say
where
are
your
questions
asked
strong
this
morning
she
wanted
to
know
what
i
thought
of
apostolic
succession
she
said
she
was
reading
some
book
by
a
newman
what
is
apostolic
succession
a
curious
disease
quite
common
among
the
poorer
classes
of
sandwich
islanders
replied
strong
no
one
has
ever
found
a
cure
for
it
do
laugh
at
us
we
do
nothing
but
cry
now
except
when
mr
hazard
is
here
and
then
we
pretend
to
be
happy
when
esther
cries
i
cry
too
that
makes
her
laugh
it
our
only
joke
and
we
used
to
have
so
many
do
you
think
it
rather
a
moist
joke
asked
strong
i
take
mine
dry
i
ca
tell
what
she
will
think
a
joke
replied
catherine
she
asked
me
what
was
my
idea
of
heaven
and
i
said
it
was
reading
novels
in
church
she
seemed
to
think
this
a
rich
bonanza
of
a
joke
and
laughed
herself
into
hysterics
but
i
was
as
serious
as
apostles
you
are
never
so
funny
as
when
you
are
serious
never
be
so
any
more
why
do
you
get
her
to
paint
she
wo
i
rather
glad
of
it
for
if
she
did
i
should
have
to
sit
for
melancholy
or
an
angel
or
something
i
not
fitted
for
by
education
what
shall
we
do
about
it
asked
strong
things
ca
go
on
in
this
way
i
think
the
engagement
had
better
come
out
said
catherine
the
longer
it
is
kept
private
the
more
she
will
doubt
whether
she
ought
to
marry
a
clergyman
what
do
you
think
about
marrying
clergymen
it
almost
be
better
to
marry
a
painter
or
even
a
professor
that
would
be
playing
it
too
low
down
replied
strong
gravely
i
would
recommend
you
to
look
out
for
a
swell
what
has
become
of
your
admirer
van
dam
gone
said
catherine
sadly
wharton
and
he
went
off
together
there
is
something
about
me
that
scares
them
all
off
the
ranche
while
they
were
thus
improving
each
other
minds
the
door
opened
and
esther
entered
she
was
pale
and
her
face
had
no
longer
the
bright
look
which
wharton
had
thought
so
characteristic
but
there
was
no
other
sign
of
trouble
about
her
and
she
welcomed
her
cousin
as
pleasantly
as
ever
so
that
he
could
hardly
believe
in
the
stories
he
had
just
heard
of
her
distress
good
day
cousin
george
she
said
thank
you
for
coming
to
cheer
up
this
poor
girl
she
needs
it
do
take
her
out
and
amuse
her
come
out
yourself
esther
you
need
it
more
than
she
does
aunt
sarah
is
coming
at
two
to
take
me
to
drive
said
esther
catherine
hates
driving
unless
she
drives
herself
i
thought
you
hated
it
too
oh
i
hate
nothing
now
replied
esther
with
a
little
of
her
old
laugh
i
am
learning
to
like
every
thing
is
that
in
the
marriage
service
asked
strong
do
you
have
to
begin
so
high
up
could
you
start
easy
and
like
a
few
things
first
me
for
instance
and
let
the
rest
wait
no
she
said
you
are
to
come
last
honestly
i
am
more
afraid
of
you
than
of
all
the
rest
of
the
world
if
you
knew
what
a
you
are
to
me
you
would
be
afraid
of
yourself
do
make
fun
of
me
any
more
i
know
i
am
horribly
funny
but
you
must
take
me
in
earnest
poor
last
words
to
me
were
and
you
safe
but
if
i
laugh
now
lost
this
is
the
first
time
i
ever
met
any
one
honest
enough
to
acknowledge
that
marriage
was
so
sad
a
thing
catherine
if
i
ask
you
to
marry
me
will
you
turn
serious
she
will
turn
serious
enough
if
she
does
it
said
esther
you
would
stay
with
her
a
week
and
then
tell
her
that
you
were
obliged
to
see
a
friend
in
japan
she
would
never
see
you
again
but
the
newspapers
would
tell
her
that
you
had
set
out
to
look
for
bones
in
the
milky
way
what
you
say
sounds
to
me
as
though
it
had
a
grain
of
truth
replied
strong
that
reminds
me
that
i
got
a
letter
telling
me
of
a
lot
of
new
bones
only
yesterday
but
i
must
leave
them
underground
till
the
summer
if
by
that
time
i
can
do
any
thing
for
you
in
oregon
let
me
know
i
want
you
very
much
to
do
something
for
me
now
said
esther
will
you
try
to
be
serious
a
moment
for
my
sake
i
do
know
said
strong
you
ask
too
much
all
at
once
where
are
you
coming
out
will
you
answer
me
a
question
say
yes
or
no
that
depends
on
the
question
mistress
esther
old
birds
are
not
to
be
caught
in
old
traps
state
your
question
as
we
say
in
the
is
religion
true
i
thought
so
cousin
esther
i
love
you
as
much
as
i
love
any
one
in
this
cold
world
but
i
ca
answer
your
question
i
can
tell
you
all
about
the
or
so
far
as
known
but
i
could
not
tell
you
the
difference
between
the
bones
of
a
saint
and
those
of
a
heathen
ask
me
something
easier
ask
me
whether
science
is
true
is
science
true
no
then
why
do
you
believe
in
it
i
do
believe
in
it
then
why
do
you
belong
to
it
because
i
want
to
help
in
making
it
truer
now
esther
just
take
this
matter
coolly
you
are
bothered
i
suppose
by
the
idea
that
you
possibly
believe
in
miracles
and
mysteries
and
therefore
ca
make
a
good
wife
for
hazard
you
might
just
as
well
make
yourself
unhappy
by
doubting
whether
you
would
make
a
good
wife
to
me
because
you
believe
the
first
axiom
in
euclid
there
is
no
science
which
does
not
begin
by
requiring
you
to
believe
the
incredible
are
you
telling
me
the
truth
i
tell
you
the
solemn
truth
that
the
doctrine
of
the
trinity
is
not
so
difficult
to
accept
for
a
working
proposition
as
any
one
of
the
axioms
of
physics
the
wife
of
my
mathematical
colleague
to
my
knowledge
never
even
stopped
to
ask
whether
it
was
true
that
a
point
had
neither
length
breadth
nor
thickness
esther
pondered
a
few
moments
looking
into
the
fire
with
a
grave
face
then
she
went
on
you
are
not
talking
honestly
why
should
i
dare
tell
you
that
your
old
fossil
bones
are
a
humbug
when
i
would
not
for
the
world
talk
so
to
mr
hazard
you
do
care
whether
geology
is
true
or
not
well
no
not
much
said
strong
i
should
care
more
if
you
told
me
that
my
best
japanese
lacquer
was
modern
besides
said
esther
you
have
not
answered
my
question
i
want
to
know
what
you
think
and
you
wo
tell
me
oh
do
let
me
lose
faith
in
you
too
i
know
your
opinions
you
think
the
whole
church
a
piece
of
superstition
i
heard
you
say
so
and
i
want
you
to
tell
me
why
you
my
cousin
and
i
a
right
to
your
help
but
you
wo
give
it
you
are
a
desperate
little
tyrant
said
strong
laughing
you
always
were
do
you
remember
how
we
fought
when
we
were
children
because
you
would
have
your
own
way
i
used
to
give
in
then
but
i
am
old
now
and
obstinate
i
know
that
you
always
ended
by
making
me
go
your
way
replied
esther
but
that
was
because
i
never
cared
much
where
i
went
now
it
is
a
matter
of
life
and
death
i
ca
move
a
step
or
even
let
our
engagement
be
announced
until
i
feel
sure
that
i
shall
not
be
a
load
on
his
neck
do
you
think
i
should
hesitate
to
break
it
off
even
if
i
broke
my
heart
with
it
if
i
thought
it
was
going
to
bring
trouble
on
him
against
this
assault
jesting
was
out
of
the
question
strong
was
forced
out
of
this
line
of
defense
and
found
himself
in
an
awkward
position
esther
not
outwardly
excited
but
leaning
her
chin
on
her
hand
and
gazing
into
the
fire
with
a
look
of
set
will
had
the
calmness
of
despair
strong
was
staggered
and
hesitated
the
trouble
with
you
is
that
you
start
wrong
said
he
at
length
you
need
what
is
called
faith
and
are
trying
to
get
it
by
reason
it
be
done
faith
is
a
state
of
mind
like
love
or
jealousy
you
can
never
reason
yourself
into
it
so
mr
hazard
says
rejoined
esther
he
tells
me
to
wait
and
it
will
come
but
he
wants
me
to
go
on
just
as
though
i
were
certain
of
its
coming
i
ca
wait
if
it
does
not
come
quickly
i
must
do
something
desperate
now
tell
me
what
you
would
do
to
get
faith
if
the
happiness
of
your
whole
life
hung
on
it
strong
rose
uneasily
from
his
seat
and
stood
up
before
the
fire
he
began
to
think
himself
rash
for
venturing
into
this
arena
he
had
always
believed
his
cousin
to
be
stronger
than
hazard
because
hazard
was
a
clergyman
but
he
had
not
hitherto
thought
her
stronger
than
himself
and
he
now
looked
at
her
carefully
wondering
whether
he
could
have
managed
her
never
in
his
life
had
he
felt
so
nearly
in
love
with
her
as
now
under
the
temptation
to
try
whether
she
could
be
made
to
give
up
her
will
to
his
this
feeling
was
the
stronger
because
even
in
his
own
eyes
his
conduct
so
far
seemed
a
little
cowardly
and
ridiculous
he
pulled
himself
up
sharply
and
seeing
nothing
else
to
be
done
he
took
up
the
weapons
of
the
church
and
asserted
the
tone
of
authority
every
one
who
marries
he
said
goes
it
blind
more
or
less
if
you
have
faith
enough
in
hazard
to
believe
in
him
you
have
faith
enough
to
accept
his
church
faith
means
submission
submit
i
want
to
submit
cried
esther
piteously
rising
in
her
turn
and
speaking
in
accents
of
real
distress
and
passion
why
ca
some
of
you
make
me
for
a
few
minutes
at
a
time
i
think
it
done
and
then
i
suddenly
find
myself
more
defiant
than
ever
i
want
nothing
of
the
church
why
should
it
trouble
me
why
should
i
submit
to
it
why
it
leave
me
alone
what
you
want
is
the
roman
church
continued
strong
mercilessly
they
know
how
to
deal
with
pride
of
will
millions
of
men
and
women
have
gone
through
the
same
struggle
and
the
church
tells
them
to
fix
their
eyes
on
a
symbol
of
faith
and
if
their
eyes
wander
scourges
them
for
it
as
he
talked
he
took
up
the
little
carved
ivory
crucifix
which
stood
on
the
among
other
bits
of
studio
furniture
and
holding
it
up
before
her
said
there
how
many
people
do
you
think
have
come
to
this
christ
of
yours
that
has
no
meaning
to
you
and
in
their
struggle
with
doubt
have
pressed
it
against
their
hearts
till
it
drew
blood
ask
it
is
that
all
said
esther
taking
the
crucifix
from
his
hand
and
looking
curiously
at
it
then
she
silently
put
it
against
her
heart
and
pressed
it
with
more
and
more
force
until
strong
caught
her
hand
in
alarm
and
pulled
it
away
come
said
he
coolly
as
he
forced
her
to
give
up
the
crucifix
my
little
bluff
has
failed
i
throw
up
the
hand
you
must
play
it
out
with
hazard
mr
hazard
was
not
happy
like
esther
he
felt
himself
getting
into
a
state
of
mind
that
threatened
to
break
his
spirit
he
had
been
used
to
ordering
matters
much
as
he
pleased
his
parish
at
cincinnati
being
his
creation
had
been
managed
by
him
as
though
he
owned
it
but
at
john
he
found
himself
less
free
and
was
conscious
of
incessant
criticism
he
had
been
now
some
months
in
his
new
pulpit
his
popular
success
had
been
marked
john
was
overflowing
with
a
transient
audience
like
a
theater
to
the
disgust
of
regular
his
personal
influence
was
great
but
he
felt
that
it
was
not
yet
and
perhaps
never
could
be
strong
enough
to
stand
the
scandal
of
his
marriage
to
a
woman
whose
opinions
were
believed
to
be
radical
on
this
point
he
was
not
left
in
doubt
for
the
mere
suspicion
of
his
engagement
raised
a
little
tempest
in
the
pool
the
stricter
sect
not
without
reason
were
scandalized
they
held
to
their
creed
and
the
bare
mention
of
esther
dudley
name
called
warm
protests
from
their
ranks
they
flatly
said
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
mr
hazard
to
make
them
believe
his
own
doctrine
to
be
sound
if
he
could
wish
to
enter
into
such
a
connection
none
but
a
could
associate
with
the
set
of
artists
and
other
unusual
people
whose
society
mr
hazard
was
known
to
affect
and
his
marriage
to
one
of
them
would
give
the
unorthodox
a
hold
on
the
parish
which
would
end
by
splitting
it
one
of
his
strongest
friends
who
had
done
most
to
bring
him
to
new
york
and
make
his
path
pleasant
came
to
him
with
an
account
of
what
was
said
and
thought
softening
the
expression
so
as
to
bear
telling
you
ought
to
hear
about
it
said
he
so
i
tell
you
but
it
is
between
you
and
me
i
do
ask
whether
you
are
engaged
to
miss
dudley
for
my
own
pleasure
i
wish
you
may
be
if
i
were
thirty
years
younger
i
would
try
for
her
myself
but
we
all
know
that
she
has
very
little
more
religious
experience
than
a
white
rosebud
i
not
strict
myself
i
do
mind
a
little
looseness
on
the
creed
but
the
trouble
is
that
every
old
woman
in
the
parish
knows
all
about
the
family
her
father
william
dudley
a
great
friend
of
mine
as
you
know
was
a
man
who
liked
to
defy
opinion
and
never
hid
his
contempt
for
ours
he
paid
for
a
pew
at
john
because
he
said
society
needs
still
that
sort
of
police
but
he
has
told
me
a
dozen
times
that
he
could
get
more
police
for
his
money
by
giving
it
to
the
roman
catholics
he
never
entered
his
pew
his
murray
is
just
as
bad
never
goes
near
the
church
and
is
always
poking
fun
at
us
who
do
the
professor
is
a
german
darwinist
and
believes
in
nothing
that
i
know
of
unless
it
is
himself
esther
took
to
society
and
i
told
by
my
young
people
that
she
was
one
of
the
best
waltzers
in
town
until
she
gave
it
up
for
painting
and
dinners
her
set
never
bothered
their
heads
about
the
church
of
the
whole
family
murray
is
the
only
one
who
has
any
weight
in
the
parish
and
she
has
a
good
deal
but
if
i
know
her
she
wo
approve
the
match
any
more
than
the
rest
and
you
must
expect
to
get
the
reputation
of
being
unorthodox
only
yesterday
old
tarbox
told
me
he
thought
you
were
rather
weak
on
the
pentateuch
and
the
best
i
could
say
was
that
we
must
choose
between
weak
doctrines
and
weak
brains
and
of
the
two
i
preferred
to
let
up
on
the
pentateuch
all
this
was
the
more
annoying
to
mr
hazard
because
his
orthodoxy
was
his
strong
point
like
most
men
seeing
that
there
was
no
between
dogma
and
negation
he
preferred
to
accept
dogma
of
all
weaknesses
he
most
disliked
timid
and
faith
he
would
rather
have
jumped
at
once
to
strong
pure
denial
than
yield
an
inch
to
the
argument
that
a
mystery
was
to
be
paltered
with
because
it
could
not
be
explained
the
idea
that
these
gossiping
parishioners
of
his
should
undertake
to
question
his
orthodoxy
tried
his
temper
he
knew
that
they
disliked
his
intimacy
with
artists
and
scientific
people
but
he
was
not
afraid
of
his
parish
and
meant
that
his
parish
should
be
a
little
afraid
of
him
he
preferred
to
give
them
some
cause
of
in
order
to
keep
them
awake
his
greatest
annoyance
came
from
another
side
if
such
gossip
should
reach
esther
ears
it
would
go
far
towards
driving
her
beyond
his
control
and
he
knew
that
even
without
this
additional
alarm
it
was
with
the
greatest
difficulty
he
could
quiet
and
restrain
her
the
threatened
disaster
was
terrible
enough
when
looked
at
as
a
mere
question
of
love
but
it
went
much
deeper
he
was
ready
to
override
criticism
and
trample
on
remonstrance
if
he
could
but
succeed
in
drawing
her
into
the
fold
because
his
lifelong
faith
that
all
human
energies
belonged
to
the
church
was
on
trial
and
if
it
broke
down
in
a
test
so
supreme
as
that
of
marriage
the
blow
would
go
far
to
prostrate
him
forever
what
was
his
religious
energy
worth
if
it
did
not
carry
him
successfully
through
such
stress
when
the
strongest
passion
in
life
was
working
on
its
side
at
the
hour
when
strong
was
making
his
disastrous
attempt
to
relieve
esther
of
her
scruples
mr
hazard
was
listening
to
these
exasperating
criticisms
from
his
parish
it
was
his
habit
to
come
every
day
at
noon
to
pass
an
hour
with
esther
and
as
he
entered
the
house
he
met
strong
leaving
it
and
asked
him
to
spare
the
time
for
a
talk
the
same
evening
he
wanted
strong
advice
and
help
a
brace
of
lovers
in
lower
spirits
than
hazard
and
esther
could
not
have
been
easily
found
in
the
city
of
new
york
or
its
vicinity
this
day
and
the
worst
part
of
their
depression
was
that
each
was
determined
to
hide
it
from
the
other
esther
could
not
tell
him
much
more
than
he
already
knew
and
would
not
throw
away
her
charm
over
him
by
adding
to
his
anxieties
while
he
knew
that
any
thing
he
could
tell
her
would
add
to
her
doubts
and
perhaps
drive
her
to
some
sudden
and
violent
step
luckily
they
were
too
much
attached
to
each
other
to
feel
the
full
awkwardness
of
their
attitude
it
is
outrageously
pleasant
to
be
with
you
he
said
one
conscience
revolts
against
such
enjoyment
i
wonder
whether
i
should
ever
get
enough
i
shall
never
give
you
a
chance
said
she
i
shall
be
strict
with
you
and
send
you
off
to
your
work
before
you
can
get
tired
of
me
you
make
me
shockingly
weary
of
my
work
he
answered
at
times
i
wish
i
could
stop
making
a
labor
of
religion
and
enjoy
it
a
little
how
pleasant
it
would
be
to
go
off
to
japan
together
and
fill
our
with
drawings
this
suggestion
came
on
esther
so
suddenly
that
she
forgot
herself
and
gave
a
little
cry
of
delight
oh
are
you
in
earnest
she
said
it
seems
to
me
that
i
could
crawl
and
swim
there
if
you
would
go
with
me
then
she
saw
her
mistake
her
outburst
of
pleasure
gave
him
pain
he
was
displeased
with
himself
for
speaking
so
thoughtlessly
for
this
idea
of
escape
made
both
of
them
conscious
of
the
chasm
on
whose
edge
they
stood
no
i
wish
i
could
be
in
earnest
he
answered
but
i
have
just
begun
work
and
there
is
no
vacation
for
me
you
must
keep
up
my
courage
without
your
help
i
shall
break
down
if
he
had
thought
out
in
advance
some
device
for
distressing
her
he
could
not
have
succeeded
better
she
had
just
time
to
realize
the
full
strength
of
her
love
for
him
when
he
thrust
the
church
between
them
and
bade
her
love
him
for
its
sake
the
delight
of
wandering
through
the
world
by
his
side
flashed
on
her
mind
only
to
show
a
whole
fifth
avenue
congregation
as
her
rival
the
conviction
that
the
church
was
hateful
to
her
and
that
she
could
never
trust
herself
to
obey
or
love
it
forced
itself
on
her
at
the
very
moment
when
she
felt
that
life
was
nothing
without
her
lover
and
that
to
give
up
all
the
world
besides
in
order
to
go
with
him
would
be
the
only
happiness
she
cared
to
ask
of
her
destiny
the
feeling
was
torture
so
long
as
he
remained
she
controlled
it
but
when
he
went
away
she
wrung
her
hands
in
despair
and
asked
herself
again
and
again
what
she
could
do
whether
she
was
not
going
mad
with
the
strain
of
these
emotions
before
she
had
fairly
succeeded
in
calming
herself
her
aunt
came
to
take
her
out
for
their
daily
drive
since
her
father
death
this
drive
with
her
aunt
or
a
walk
with
catherine
had
been
her
only
escape
from
the
confinement
of
the
house
and
she
depended
on
it
more
than
on
food
and
drink
they
went
first
to
some
shops
where
murray
had
purchases
to
make
and
esther
sat
alone
in
the
carriage
while
her
aunt
was
engaged
within
in
buying
whatever
household
articles
were
on
her
list
for
the
day
as
esther
sitting
quietly
in
the
corner
of
the
carriage
mechanically
watched
the
she
saw
the
familiar
figure
of
wharton
among
them
and
with
a
sudden
movement
of
her
old
vivacity
she
bent
forward
caught
his
eye
and
held
out
her
hand
he
stopped
before
the
carriage
window
and
spoke
with
more
than
common
cordiality
i
wanted
to
come
and
see
you
but
i
heard
you
received
no
one
i
will
always
see
you
she
replied
looking
more
than
ever
shy
and
embarrassed
he
said
that
he
should
certainly
come
as
soon
as
his
work
would
let
him
and
meanwhile
he
wanted
her
to
know
how
glad
he
was
to
be
able
at
last
to
offer
his
congratulations
congratulations
on
what
said
she
beginning
to
flush
scarlet
wharton
stammered
out
i
was
this
moment
told
by
a
lady
of
your
acquaintance
that
your
engagement
to
mr
hazard
was
formally
announced
esther
grew
as
pale
as
she
had
been
red
and
answered
quietly
when
my
engagement
to
any
one
is
announced
i
promise
to
let
you
know
of
it
wharton
before
the
world
knows
it
he
apologized
and
passed
on
esther
shrinking
back
into
her
corner
struggled
in
vain
to
recover
from
this
new
blow
murray
on
returning
found
her
in
a
state
of
feverish
excitement
i
am
being
dragged
in
against
my
will
said
she
i
am
beyond
my
depth
what
am
i
to
do
most
women
feel
so
at
first
replied
her
aunt
calmly
many
want
to
escape
some
are
afterwards
sorry
they
did
have
you
heard
of
this
too
and
not
told
me
asked
esther
murray
had
thought
too
long
over
the
coming
trouble
to
hesitate
now
that
the
moment
had
come
she
had
watched
for
the
crisis
her
mind
was
made
up
to
take
her
share
of
the
responsibility
so
she
now
settled
herself
down
to
the
task
as
the
thing
had
to
be
done
she
thought
that
the
shortest
agony
was
the
most
merciful
yes
she
answered
several
persons
have
mentioned
it
to
me
and
i
have
had
to
profess
not
to
know
what
they
meant
what
did
they
say
asked
esther
breathlessly
the
only
one
who
has
talked
openly
to
me
about
it
is
your
friend
dyer
the
story
came
from
her
and
i
believe
she
invented
it
of
course
she
disapproves
i
never
knew
her
to
approve
what
reason
does
she
give
she
says
that
you
are
an
amiable
girl
but
one
given
up
to
worldly
pursuits
and
without
a
trace
of
religious
principle
the
last
woman
to
make
a
clergyman
wife
though
you
might
do
very
well
for
an
artist
or
somebody
wicked
enough
for
you
as
i
gathered
her
idea
i
am
told
that
she
amuses
herself
by
adding
that
she
never
took
mr
hazard
for
a
clergyman
and
the
sooner
he
quits
the
pulpit
the
better
she
is
never
satisfied
without
hitting
every
one
she
can
reach
what
does
she
want
asked
esther
i
suppose
she
wants
to
break
off
the
intimacy
she
thinks
there
is
no
actual
engagement
yet
and
the
surest
way
to
prevent
one
is
to
invent
one
in
time
esther
reflected
a
few
minutes
before
beginning
again
aunt
do
you
think
i
am
fit
to
be
his
wife
it
all
depends
on
you
replied
murray
if
you
feel
yourself
fit
you
are
the
best
person
in
the
world
for
it
you
would
be
a
brand
saved
from
the
burning
and
it
will
be
a
great
feather
in
mr
hazard
cap
to
convert
you
into
a
strong
he
could
then
afford
to
laugh
at
dyer
and
all
the
parish
would
laugh
with
him
aunt
said
esther
in
an
tone
i
am
jealous
of
the
church
i
never
shall
like
it
then
esther
you
are
doing
very
wrong
to
let
mr
hazard
think
you
can
marry
him
you
will
ruin
him
and
yourself
too
he
has
seen
how
i
have
struggled
answered
esther
with
a
sort
of
sob
i
never
knew
how
gentle
and
patient
a
man
could
be
until
i
saw
how
he
helped
me
he
began
by
taking
all
the
risk
i
told
him
faithfully
that
i
was
not
fit
for
him
and
he
said
that
he
only
asked
me
to
love
him
i
did
love
him
i
love
him
so
much
that
if
he
were
a
beggar
in
the
street
here
and
wanted
me
i
would
get
down
and
pick
up
rags
with
him
she
moaned
out
this
last
sentence
so
piteously
that
murray
heart
bled
poor
child
she
thought
it
is
like
crushing
a
sparrow
with
a
stone
i
must
do
it
quickly
tell
him
all
about
it
esther
it
is
his
affair
more
than
yours
if
his
love
is
great
enough
to
take
you
as
you
are
do
your
best
and
never
let
him
repent
it
but
you
must
make
him
choose
between
you
and
his
profession
i
ca
do
that
said
esther
quickly
i
would
rather
go
on
and
leave
it
all
to
chance
if
you
do
replied
murray
you
will
only
put
yourself
into
his
hands
sooner
or
later
mr
hazard
must
find
out
that
you
do
belong
to
him
then
it
will
be
his
duty
to
make
you
choose
between
your
will
and
his
you
had
better
not
let
yourself
be
put
in
such
a
position
a
woman
can
afford
to
break
an
engagement
but
she
ca
afford
to
be
thrown
over
by
a
man
not
even
if
he
is
a
clergyman
and
that
is
what
mr
hazard
will
have
to
do
to
you
if
you
let
him
go
on
oh
i
know
him
better
broke
out
esther
she
resented
bitterly
this
cruel
charge
against
her
lover
but
nevertheless
it
cut
into
her
quivering
nerves
until
her
love
seemed
to
wither
under
it
the
idea
that
he
could
ever
want
to
get
rid
of
her
was
the
last
drop
in
her
cup
of
bitterness
murray
knew
how
to
crush
her
sparrow
she
needed
barely
five
minutes
to
do
it
from
the
moment
that
esther
feminine
pride
was
involved
the
sparrow
was
dead
certainly
hazard
had
as
yet
no
thought
of
giving
up
his
prize
but
he
had
reached
the
first
stage
of
wondering
what
he
should
do
with
it
naturally
sanguine
and
perhaps
a
little
spoiled
by
flattery
and
success
he
had
taken
for
granted
that
esther
would
at
once
absorb
her
existence
in
his
he
hoped
that
she
would
become
like
most
converts
more
zealous
than
himself
after
a
week
of
trial
finding
her
not
only
unaffected
by
his
influence
but
actually
slipping
more
and
more
from
his
control
he
began
to
feel
an
alarm
which
grew
more
acute
every
hour
and
brought
him
for
the
first
time
face
to
face
with
the
possibility
of
failure
what
could
he
do
to
overcome
this
fatal
coldness
with
very
uneasy
feelings
he
admitted
that
a
step
backwards
must
be
taken
and
it
was
for
this
purpose
that
he
wanted
to
consult
with
strong
never
was
the
church
blessed
with
a
stranger
ally
than
this
freest
of
free
thinkers
who
looked
at
churches
very
much
as
he
would
have
looked
at
a
layer
of
extinct
oysters
in
a
buried
notion
was
that
since
the
church
continued
to
exist
it
probably
served
some
necessary
purpose
in
human
economy
though
he
could
himself
no
more
understand
the
good
of
it
than
he
could
comprehend
the
use
of
human
existence
in
any
shape
since
men
and
women
were
here
idiotic
and
purposeless
as
they
might
be
they
had
what
they
chose
to
call
a
right
to
amuse
themselves
in
their
own
way
and
if
this
way
made
some
happy
without
hurting
others
strong
was
ready
enough
to
help
he
was
as
willing
to
help
hazard
as
to
help
esther
provided
the
happiness
of
either
seemed
to
be
within
reach
and
as
for
forms
of
faith
it
seemed
to
him
as
easy
to
believe
one
thing
as
another
if
esther
believed
any
thing
at
all
he
could
see
no
reason
why
she
might
not
believe
whatever
hazard
wanted
with
all
the
in
the
world
he
came
from
his
club
after
dinner
to
hazard
house
as
the
way
was
short
he
did
not
even
grumble
knowing
that
he
could
smoke
his
cigar
as
well
at
one
place
as
at
the
other
he
found
hazard
in
his
library
walking
up
and
down
with
more
discouragement
on
his
face
than
strong
had
ever
seen
there
before
the
old
confusion
of
the
room
had
not
quite
disappeared
the
books
were
not
yet
all
arranged
on
their
shelves
pictures
still
leaned
against
the
wall
dust
had
accumulated
on
them
and
even
on
the
large
working
table
where
sermons
lay
scattered
among
a
mass
of
notes
circulars
invitations
and
unanswered
letters
it
was
clear
that
mr
hazard
was
not
an
orderly
person
and
needed
nothing
so
much
as
a
wife
esther
would
have
been
little
flattered
at
the
remark
now
rather
common
among
his
older
friends
that
almost
any
wife
would
be
better
for
him
than
none
with
an
echo
of
his
old
boyish
cordiality
he
welcomed
strong
gave
him
the
best
by
the
fire
and
told
him
to
smoke
as
much
as
he
liked
perhaps
a
cigar
will
give
you
wisdom
he
added
you
will
need
it
for
i
want
to
consult
you
about
esther
do
said
strong
laconically
hush
replied
hazard
you
put
me
out
i
do
consult
you
because
i
like
it
but
because
i
must
the
matter
is
becoming
serious
and
i
must
either
consult
you
or
murray
i
prefer
to
begin
with
you
it
a
habit
i
have
at
your
own
risk
then
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
take
whatever
risk
there
is
in
it
answered
hazard
i
must
do
something
for
if
my
amiable
parishioner
dyer
gets
at
esther
in
her
present
state
of
mind
the
poor
child
will
work
herself
into
a
brain
fever
but
first
tell
me
one
thing
were
you
ever
in
love
with
esther
yourself
never
replied
strong
peacefully
esther
always
told
me
that
i
had
nothing
but
chalk
and
in
my
mind
and
could
never
love
or
be
loved
we
have
discussed
it
a
good
deal
she
says
i
am
an
old
glove
that
fits
well
enough
but
will
not
cling
of
course
it
was
her
business
to
make
me
cling
and
i
told
her
so
no
i
never
was
in
love
with
her
but
i
have
been
nearer
it
these
last
ten
days
than
ever
before
she
will
come
out
of
her
trouble
either
made
or
marred
and
a
year
hence
i
will
tell
you
which
take
care
said
hazard
i
have
learned
to
conquer
all
my
passions
except
jealousy
and
that
i
have
never
yet
tried
if
she
marries
you
replied
strong
that
will
settle
it
she
marries
me
broke
out
hazard
paying
no
attention
to
quiet
assumption
that
for
esther
to
be
thus
married
was
to
be
marred
do
you
mean
that
there
is
any
doubt
about
it
i
supposed
that
was
what
you
wanted
to
talk
about
answered
strong
with
some
surprise
is
any
thing
else
the
matter
you
always
put
facts
in
a
horribly
materialistic
way
responded
hazard
i
wanted
to
consult
you
about
making
things
easier
for
her
not
about
broken
engagements
bless
your
idealistic
soul
said
strong
i
have
already
tried
to
help
her
in
that
way
and
made
a
shocking
piece
of
work
has
not
esther
told
you
and
he
went
on
to
give
his
friend
an
account
of
the
conversation
in
which
his
attempt
to
preach
the
orthodox
faith
had
suffered
disastrous
defeat
hazard
listened
closely
and
at
the
end
sat
for
some
time
silent
in
deep
thought
then
he
said
esther
told
me
something
of
this
though
i
did
not
get
the
idea
it
was
so
serious
i
am
glad
to
know
the
whole
but
you
should
not
have
tried
to
discipline
her
leave
the
thunders
of
the
church
to
me
what
could
i
do
asked
strong
she
jammed
me
close
up
to
the
wall
i
did
not
know
where
to
turn
you
would
have
been
still
less
pleased
if
i
had
done
what
she
wanted
and
given
her
the
whole
agnostic
creed
i
am
not
quite
so
sure
about
that
rejoined
hazard
thoughtfully
i
am
never
afraid
of
pure
atheism
it
is
the
flabby
kind
of
sentimental
deism
that
annoys
me
because
it
is
as
slippery
as
air
if
you
will
tell
her
honestly
what
your
skepticism
means
i
will
risk
the
consequences
just
as
you
like
said
strong
if
she
attacks
me
again
i
will
give
her
the
strongest
kind
of
a
dose
of
what
you
are
pleased
to
call
pure
atheism
not
that
i
mind
what
it
is
called
she
shall
have
it
crude
only
remember
that
i
prefer
to
tackle
her
on
the
other
side
do
as
you
please
said
hazard
now
let
us
come
to
business
all
esther
wants
is
time
i
am
as
certain
as
i
can
be
of
any
thing
in
this
uncertain
world
that
a
few
weeks
or
at
the
outside
a
few
months
will
quiet
all
her
fears
what
i
want
is
to
stop
this
immediate
strain
which
is
enough
to
distract
any
woman
stop
the
strain
of
course
said
strong
i
want
to
stop
it
almost
as
much
as
you
do
but
it
looked
to
me
this
morning
as
though
what
you
call
strain
were
a
steady
drift
which
pays
no
sort
of
heed
to
our
trying
to
stop
it
i
feel
sure
it
is
only
nervousness
said
hazard
earnestly
give
her
time
quiet
and
rest
she
will
come
out
right
then
what
is
it
that
i
can
do
help
me
to
get
her
out
of
new
york
i
will
ask
my
aunt
to
help
you
replied
strong
but
how
are
we
to
do
it
the
earthly
paradise
is
not
to
be
found
in
this
neighborhood
in
the
middle
of
february
never
mind
if
you
and
she
will
back
me
we
can
do
it
and
it
must
be
done
instantly
to
be
of
use
there
is
no
end
of
parish
gossip
which
must
not
come
to
esther
ears
or
it
will
drive
her
wild
take
her
to
florida
california
or
even
to
europe
if
you
can
give
me
time
to
smooth
things
down
if
she
stays
here
we
shall
all
be
the
worse
for
it
as
usual
hazard
had
his
way
george
consented
to
do
all
he
asked
and
even
to
take
esther
away
himself
if
it
were
necessary
the
next
morning
he
appeared
soon
after
breakfast
at
his
aunt
to
report
wishes
and
to
devise
the
means
of
satisfying
them
much
to
his
relief
and
rather
to
his
astonishment
he
found
murray
disposed
to
look
with
favor
on
the
idea
she
listened
quietly
to
his
story
and
after
a
little
reflection
asked
where
do
you
think
we
had
best
go
do
you
mean
to
go
too
asked
strong
in
surprise
why
should
you
tear
yourself
up
by
the
roots
to
please
hazard
those
two
girls
ca
go
alone
said
murray
and
as
for
me
i
do
go
to
please
mr
hazard
i
do
think
he
is
going
to
be
pleased
now
what
mischief
are
you
brewing
aunt
sarah
i
am
hazard
friend
and
bound
to
see
him
through
do
make
me
a
party
to
any
scheme
against
him
you
are
not
very
bright
george
and
just
now
you
are
rather
ridiculous
because
you
do
not
in
the
least
know
what
you
are
about
go
on
said
strong
with
irrepressible
good
nature
play
out
all
your
trumps
and
let
my
suit
in
could
you
be
ready
to
start
for
niagara
by
morning
asked
his
aunt
is
saturday
yes
i
could
manage
it
could
you
get
some
pleasant
man
to
go
with
you
not
much
chance
he
replied
i
might
ask
wharton
but
he
is
very
busy
try
for
him
i
will
send
you
a
note
to
your
club
early
this
evening
to
say
whether
i
shall
want
you
or
not
if
i
make
you
go
i
shall
go
too
and
take
esther
and
catherine
i
will
do
any
thing
you
want
said
strong
on
condition
that
you
tell
me
what
you
are
about
murray
looked
at
her
nephew
with
a
pitying
air
and
said
any
one
with
common
sense
might
see
that
esther
engagement
never
could
come
to
any
thing
but
you
are
trying
to
hold
her
to
it
i
am
trying
to
do
no
such
thing
i
expect
esther
to
dismiss
him
then
she
will
need
some
change
of
scene
and
i
mean
to
take
her
away
asked
strong
in
alarm
or
sooner
or
later
we
have
got
to
be
ready
for
it
at
any
moment
now
do
you
understand
i
think
i
am
beginning
to
catch
on
replied
strong
with
a
grave
face
i
wish
i
were
out
of
the
scrape
i
told
you
never
to
get
into
it
rejoined
his
aunt
poor
hazard
muttered
george
wondering
whether
he
could
do
anything
to
ward
off
this
last
blow
from
his
friend
even
as
he
spoke
the
crisis
was
at
hand
murray
calculations
were
exact
while
hazard
had
been
arranging
with
strong
the
plan
for
getting
esther
away
from
new
york
letting
the
engagement
remain
private
esther
in
a
state
of
feverish
restlessness
was
wearying
catherine
with
endless
discussion
of
her
trouble
even
catherine
felt
that
one
way
or
the
other
it
was
time
for
this
thing
to
stop
esther
had
passed
the
stage
of
and
was
in
a
mutinous
mood
she
had
given
up
the
effort
to
reconcile
herself
with
her
situation
and
yet
could
talk
of
nothing
but
hazard
until
catherine
was
sorely
tried
i
never
was
such
a
bore
till
now
said
esther
at
length
as
though
she
could
not
at
all
understand
it
i
could
sometimes
be
quite
pleasant
i
used
to
go
about
the
house
singing
and
laughing
am
i
going
mad
suppose
we
go
mad
together
said
catherine
i
will
if
you
will
suppose
we
elope
together
said
esther
will
you
run
off
with
me
any
where
but
to
colorado
replied
catherine
i
have
seen
all
i
want
of
colorado
we
will
take
our
wedding
journey
together
and
leave
our
husbands
behind
let
them
catch
us
if
they
can
continued
esther
talking
rapidly
and
feverishly
it
would
be
rather
fun
to
see
mr
hazard
driving
van
dam
fast
trotters
after
us
remarked
catherine
when
shall
we
go
can
we
start
now
do
you
think
we
had
better
go
to
bed
just
now
and
elope
in
the
morning
grumbled
catherine
they
can
see
us
better
by
daylight
i
tell
you
catherine
that
i
am
in
awful
earnest
i
mean
to
go
away
somewhere
and
if
you
wo
go
with
me
i
shall
go
alone
suppose
they
catch
us
said
catherine
i
do
care
i
am
hopelessly
wicked
i
ca
be
respectable
and
believe
the
articles
i
ca
go
to
church
every
sunday
or
hold
my
tongue
or
pretend
to
be
pious
then
why
do
you
tell
him
so
and
let
him
run
away
asked
catherine
because
then
he
would
think
it
his
duty
to
run
said
esther
and
i
do
want
to
be
run
away
from
would
you
like
to
have
the
world
think
you
were
jilted
how
you
do
torture
your
poor
brain
said
catherine
pityingly
there
go
to
bed
now
it
is
long
past
midnight
i
will
run
you
off
and
you
never
shall
go
to
church
any
more
esther
was
really
in
a
way
to
alarm
her
friends
she
went
to
bed
as
catherine
advised
but
her
sleep
was
feverish
as
though
she
had
dieted
herself
on
opium
she
acted
over
and
over
again
the
scene
that
lay
before
her
until
her
brain
felt
physically
weary
as
though
it
had
run
all
night
round
and
round
its
narrow
chamber
her
head
was
so
tired
in
the
morning
that
it
was
a
relief
to
get
up
and
face
real
life
she
dressed
herself
with
uncommon
care
she
meant
to
keep
her
crown
even
though
she
threw
away
her
kingdom
and
though
she
should
lose
a
husband
she
intended
to
hold
fast
her
lover
women
have
the
right
to
this
coquetry
with
fate
iphigenia
herself
when
the
priests
who
muffled
her
voice
stretched
her
on
the
altar
and
struck
the
knife
in
her
throat
tried
to
charm
them
with
her
sad
eyes
while
her
saffron
blood
was
flowing
and
they
saw
that
she
would
have
charmed
them
with
her
voice
even
when
hope
had
vanished
the
unfortunate
hazard
was
not
precisely
an
agamemnon
and
would
have
liked
nothing
better
than
to
stop
the
sacrifice
which
seemed
to
him
much
too
closely
like
a
triumph
over
himself
his
own
throat
was
the
one
which
felt
itself
in
closest
danger
of
the
knife
at
noon
as
usual
he
came
in
trying
to
conceal
his
anxiety
under
an
appearance
of
confidence
but
esther
first
words
routed
all
his
forces
and
drove
him
back
to
his
last
defense
i
should
not
have
let
you
come
i
ought
to
have
written
to
bid
you
but
it
was
too
hard
not
to
see
you
once
more
i
am
going
away
i
am
going
with
you
said
hazard
quietly
no
you
are
not
replied
esther
you
are
to
stay
here
and
attend
to
your
duties
forget
me
as
soon
as
you
can
hazard
took
this
address
very
and
neither
showed
nor
felt
surprise
you
have
been
tormented
by
this
idea
he
said
and
i
am
glad
now
to
meet
it
face
to
face
for
us
to
part
is
impossible
you
and
i
are
one
you
can
not
get
yourself
apart
from
me
though
you
may
make
us
both
unhappy
and
even
if
you
go
away
forever
you
will
still
belong
to
me
i
could
not
release
you
if
i
would
i
do
want
to
be
released
said
esther
if
it
were
only
for
that
i
would
stay
with
you
as
long
as
you
would
let
me
i
would
do
whatever
you
told
me
and
never
ask
a
question
but
i
will
not
be
your
evil
genius
i
will
be
your
good
genius
or
nothing
be
my
good
genius
then
what
stands
in
your
way
i
have
tried
and
failed
already
there
is
not
a
woman
in
your
parish
who
is
not
saying
that
i
shall
ruin
you
and
your
career
i
would
rather
die
than
run
the
risk
of
your
thinking
i
had
done
you
harm
if
i
seeing
all
this
am
willing
to
take
the
risk
why
should
you
ally
yourself
against
me
with
all
the
petty
gossip
of
a
parish
asked
hazard
such
talk
will
stop
the
moment
you
say
the
word
let
me
go
out
now
and
announce
our
engagement
if
i
did
not
sometimes
shock
my
parish
i
could
never
manage
them
but
i
would
rather
not
be
made
useful
in
that
way
said
esther
with
a
momentary
gleam
of
humor
in
her
eyes
no
woman
wants
to
be
shocking
now
i
have
a
favor
to
ask
of
you
it
is
the
last
and
i
want
you
to
promise
to
grant
it
not
if
it
is
to
give
you
up
i
want
you
to
make
it
easy
for
me
i
am
trying
to
do
right
i
am
so
weak
and
unhappy
after
all
that
has
happened
that
if
you
are
cruel
to
me
i
shall
want
to
die
be
generous
you
know
i
am
right
let
me
go
quietly
and
do
not
torture
me
she
sat
down
as
they
were
talking
he
sinking
into
a
chair
by
her
side
took
both
her
hands
in
his
and
she
did
not
try
to
free
them
when
she
made
her
appeal
he
answered
as
quietly
and
stubbornly
as
before
never
you
are
my
wife
and
my
wife
you
will
always
be
in
my
eyes
i
shall
not
give
you
up
i
shall
not
make
it
easy
for
you
to
give
me
up
i
shall
make
it
as
hard
as
i
can
i
shall
prevent
it
but
i
will
do
anything
you
like
to
make
our
engagement
easy
and
i
came
with
something
to
propose
no
doubt
had
hazard
taken
her
at
her
word
and
coolly
walked
away
esther
would
have
been
very
unpleasantly
surprised
she
did
not
expect
him
to
obey
her
first
orders
nor
did
she
want
to
hurry
the
moment
of
separation
or
to
part
from
him
with
a
feeling
of
bitterness
his
presence
always
soothed
and
satisfied
her
and
she
had
never
been
calmer
than
now
when
with
her
hands
in
his
she
waited
for
his
new
suggestion
i
want
you
to
do
me
a
favor
not
nearly
so
great
as
the
one
you
ask
of
me
said
he
give
me
time
go
abroad
if
you
think
best
but
let
our
engagement
stand
let
me
come
out
and
join
you
in
the
summer
i
am
ready
to
see
you
go
where
you
like
and
stay
as
long
as
you
please
if
you
take
me
with
you
esther
reflected
for
a
moment
how
she
should
answer
she
had
thought
of
this
plan
and
rejected
it
long
before
because
it
seemed
to
her
to
combine
all
possible
objections
and
to
get
rid
of
none
she
knew
that
neither
six
months
nor
six
years
would
make
her
a
fit
wife
for
hazard
and
that
it
would
be
dishonest
to
lure
him
on
by
any
hope
that
she
could
change
her
nature
but
it
was
not
easy
to
put
this
in
delicate
words
at
length
she
answered
simply
i
am
almost
the
last
person
in
the
world
whom
you
ought
to
marry
time
will
only
make
me
more
unfit
should
you
think
so
he
asked
quickly
if
i
were
a
lawyer
or
a
stock
broker
she
colored
and
withdrew
her
hands
no
she
said
if
you
were
a
stock
broker
i
suppose
i
should
be
quite
satisfied
now
i
am
low
enough
am
i
not
do
make
me
feel
more
degraded
than
i
am
let
me
go
off
alone
and
forget
me
but
hazard
continued
to
press
his
point
with
infinite
patience
and
gentle
obstinacy
until
her
powers
of
resistance
were
almost
worn
out
again
and
again
the
tears
came
into
her
eyes
and
she
would
have
told
him
gladly
to
take
her
and
do
what
he
liked
with
her
if
she
had
not
steeled
herself
with
the
fixed
thought
that
in
this
case
the
whole
struggle
must
begin
again
and
he
would
know
no
better
what
to
do
with
her
than
before
he
would
talk
only
of
their
love
attacking
her
where
she
could
not
defend
herself
and
took
almost
a
pleasure
in
acknowledging
that
she
was
at
his
mercy
oh
if
you
want
only
my
love
she
said
at
last
with
a
gesture
of
despair
i
have
lost
all
my
pride
i
would
like
nothing
better
than
to
lie
down
and
die
in
your
arms
i
will
promise
to
be
faithful
to
you
all
my
life
to
go
into
a
convent
if
you
want
it
to
drown
myself
or
do
any
thing
but
lose
your
love
it
is
not
so
very
much
i
ask
he
urged
you
fear
hurting
me
by
marrying
me
do
you
ever
reflect
how
much
you
will
hurt
me
by
refusing
do
you
know
how
solitary
i
am
not
a
human
being
counts
for
any
thing
in
my
life
when
i
go
to
my
rooms
i
am
terrified
to
think
how
lonely
they
will
seem
unless
i
can
keep
you
in
my
mind
you
are
the
only
woman
i
ever
loved
you
are
my
companion
my
ideal
my
life
we
two
souls
have
wandered
about
the
universe
from
all
eternity
waiting
to
meet
each
other
and
now
after
we
have
met
and
become
one
you
try
to
part
us
as
he
went
on
with
this
appeal
he
wrought
himself
into
stronger
and
stronger
expression
of
feeling
while
esther
fell
back
in
her
chair
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
if
i
am
willing
to
risk
every
thing
for
you
why
should
you
refuse
to
grant
me
so
small
a
favor
as
i
ask
look
esther
what
more
can
i
do
will
you
not
make
a
little
sacrifice
of
pride
for
me
will
you
ever
find
another
man
to
love
you
as
i
do
how
merciless
you
are
sobbed
esther
i
ask
only
for
time
he
hurried
on
to
part
from
you
now
in
this
room
at
this
moment
forever
is
awful
you
may
go
if
you
will
but
i
shall
follow
you
i
will
never
give
you
up
you
are
mine
mine
mine
his
passionate
cry
of
love
was
more
than
flesh
and
blood
could
bear
with
an
uncontrollable
impulse
of
esther
held
out
her
hand
to
him
and
he
seized
her
in
his
arms
kissing
her
passionately
again
and
again
till
she
tore
herself
away
there
go
said
she
breathlessly
go
you
are
killing
me
without
waiting
an
answer
she
turned
and
hurried
away
to
her
room
where
flinging
herself
down
she
sobbed
till
her
hysterical
passion
wore
itself
out
at
her
usual
hour
for
taking
esther
to
drive
murray
appeared
at
the
house
where
she
found
catherine
looking
as
little
pleased
as
though
she
were
ordered
to
return
to
her
native
prairie
we
have
sent
him
off
said
she
and
we
are
clean
broke
up
the
tears
were
in
her
eyes
as
she
thus
announced
the
tragedy
which
had
been
acted
only
an
hour
or
two
before
but
her
coolness
more
than
ever
won
murray
heart
tell
me
all
that
has
happened
said
she
i
told
you
all
i
know
replied
catherine
they
had
it
out
here
for
an
hour
or
more
and
then
esther
ran
up
to
her
room
i
been
to
the
door
half
a
dozen
times
and
could
hear
her
crying
and
moaning
inside
murray
sat
down
with
a
rueful
face
and
a
weary
sigh
but
there
was
no
sign
of
hesitation
or
doubt
in
her
manner
the
time
had
come
for
her
to
take
command
and
she
did
it
without
fretfulness
or
unnecessary
words
you
are
the
only
person
i
know
with
a
head
said
she
to
catherine
you
have
some
common
sense
and
can
help
me
i
want
to
take
esther
out
of
this
place
within
six
hours
can
you
manage
to
get
every
thing
ready
i
will
run
it
all
if
you
will
take
care
of
esther
replied
catherine
i
not
old
enough
to
boss
her
all
you
will
have
to
do
is
to
see
that
your
trunks
are
packed
for
a
week
absence
and
you
are
both
ready
to
start
by
eight
answered
murray
do
you
attend
to
that
and
i
will
look
out
for
the
rest
now
wait
here
a
few
minutes
while
i
go
up
and
see
esther
catherine
wished
nothing
better
than
to
start
any
where
at
the
shortest
notice
she
was
tired
of
the
long
strain
on
her
sympathies
and
feelings
and
was
glad
to
be
made
useful
in
a
way
that
pleased
her
practical
mind
murray
went
up
to
esther
room
all
was
quiet
inside
the
storm
had
spent
itself
knowing
that
her
aunt
would
come
esther
had
made
the
effort
to
be
herself
again
and
when
murray
knocked
at
the
door
the
voice
that
told
her
to
come
in
was
firm
and
sweet
as
ever
esther
was
getting
ready
for
her
drive
and
though
her
eyes
in
spite
of
bathing
were
red
and
swollen
they
had
no
longer
the
anxious
and
troubled
look
of
a
hunted
creature
which
had
so
much
alarmed
murray
for
the
last
few
days
her
expression
was
more
composed
than
it
had
been
for
weeks
her
love
had
already
become
a
sorrow
rather
than
a
passion
and
she
would
not
for
a
world
of
lovers
have
gone
back
to
the
distress
of
yesterday
murray
took
in
the
whole
situation
at
a
glance
and
breathed
a
breath
of
relief
at
length
the
crisis
was
past
and
she
had
only
to
save
the
girl
from
brooding
over
her
pain
without
waiting
for
an
explanation
she
plunged
into
the
torrent
of
esther
woes
murray
and
i
are
going
to
niagara
by
the
night
train
i
want
you
and
catherine
to
go
with
us
you
are
an
angel
answered
esther
did
catherine
tell
you
how
i
wanted
to
run
away
you
knew
it
would
be
so
i
will
go
any
where
the
further
the
better
but
how
can
i
drag
you
and
poor
uncle
john
away
from
town
at
this
season
ca
i
go
off
alone
with
catherine
nonsense
said
her
aunt
briefly
i
shall
be
glad
to
get
away
from
new
york
i
am
tired
of
it
get
your
trunks
packed
put
in
your
sketching
materials
and
we
will
pick
you
up
at
eight
george
shall
come
on
and
pass
sunday
with
us
esther
thanked
her
aunt
with
effusion
i
am
going
to
show
you
how
well
i
can
behave
uncle
john
shall
not
know
that
any
thing
is
the
matter
with
me
unless
you
tell
him
i
wo
be
contemptible
even
if
i
have
got
red
eyes
not
five
minutes
were
needed
to
decide
on
the
new
departure
esther
and
catherine
found
relief
and
amusement
in
the
bustle
of
preparation
if
esther
was
still
a
little
feverish
and
excited
she
was
able
to
throw
it
off
in
work
she
was
no
longer
an
object
of
pity
it
was
her
uncle
and
aunt
who
deserved
deepest
compassion
what
worse
shock
was
possible
for
an
elderly
new
york
lawyer
than
to
return
to
his
house
at
six
and
find
that
he
is
to
have
barely
time
for
his
dinner
and
cigar
before
being
thrust
out
into
the
cold
and
hideous
darkness
of
a
february
night
in
order
to
travel
some
four
hundred
miles
through
a
country
it
is
true
that
he
had
received
some
little
warning
to
arrange
his
affairs
for
an
absence
over
saturday
but
at
best
the
blow
was
a
severe
one
and
he
bore
it
with
a
silent
fortitude
which
wrung
his
wife
heart
she
was
a
masterful
mistress
but
she
was
good
to
those
who
obeyed
and
she
even
showed
the
weakness
of
begging
him
not
to
go
although
in
her
soul
she
knew
that
he
must
after
all
john
you
need
go
with
us
i
can
take
the
girls
alone
as
i
understand
it
you
have
engaged
my
professional
services
he
replied
on
the
whole
i
prefer
prevention
to
cure
i
would
rather
help
esther
to
run
away
than
get
her
a
divorce
when
i
am
dead
you
shall
stay
quietly
at
home
and
be
perfectly
happy
she
answered
with
the
venerable
device
which
wives
from
earliest
history
have
used
to
palliate
their
own
sins
nevertheless
he
felt
almost
as
miserable
as
his
wife
when
wrapped
in
cloaks
and
rugs
they
left
their
bright
dining
room
and
shuffled
down
the
steps
into
the
outside
darkness
to
their
carriage
he
expressed
opinions
about
lovers
which
would
have
put
a
quick
end
to
the
human
race
had
they
been
laws
of
nature
he
wished
the
church
would
take
them
all
and
consign
them
to
its
own
favorite
place
of
punishment
he
had
a
disagreeable
trick
of
gibing
at
his
wife
orthodoxy
on
this
point
and
when
she
remonstrated
at
his
profanity
he
smiled
contentedly
and
said
there
is
nothing
profane
about
it
it
is
sound
church
doctrine
and
i
envy
you
for
being
able
to
believe
it
you
can
hope
to
see
them
with
your
own
eyes
getting
their
reward
confound
them
consoling
himself
with
this
pleasing
hope
they
started
off
and
in
five
minutes
were
at
esther
door
after
taking
the
two
girls
into
the
carriage
murray
became
more
affable
and
even
gay
by
the
time
the
party
was
established
in
their
sleeping
car
he
had
begun
to
enjoy
himself
he
had
too
often
made
such
journeys
and
was
too
familiar
with
every
thing
on
the
road
to
be
long
out
of
humor
and
for
once
it
was
amusing
to
have
a
pair
of
pretty
girls
to
take
with
him
commonly
his
best
society
was
some
member
of
the
albany
legislature
and
his
only
conversation
was
about
city
charters
and
railroad
legislation
the
variety
had
its
charm
esther
was
as
good
as
her
word
she
made
a
desperate
battle
to
recover
her
gayety
and
the
little
excitement
of
a
night
journey
helped
the
triumph
of
her
pride
determined
that
she
would
not
be
an
object
of
pity
she
made
the
most
of
all
her
chances
pretended
to
take
in
earnest
her
uncle
humorous
instructions
as
to
the
art
of
arranging
a
sleeping
berth
and
horrified
her
aunt
by
letting
him
induce
catherine
and
herself
to
eat
hot
doughnuts
and
mince
pies
on
the
train
it
was
outwardly
a
gay
little
party
which
rattled
along
the
bank
of
the
snowy
river
on
their
way
northward
the
gayety
it
is
true
was
forced
for
the
first
ten
minutes
esther
felt
excited
by
the
sense
of
flight
and
the
rapid
motion
which
was
carrying
her
she
knew
not
where
away
into
the
infinite
and
unknown
what
lay
before
her
beyond
the
darkness
of
the
moment
she
hardly
cared
never
again
could
she
go
back
to
the
old
life
but
like
a
young
bird
that
has
lost
its
mate
she
must
fly
on
through
the
gloom
till
it
end
unluckily
all
her
thoughts
brought
her
back
to
hazard
even
this
sense
of
resembling
a
bird
that
flies
it
knows
not
where
recalled
to
her
the
sonnet
of
petrarch
which
she
had
once
translated
for
him
and
which
since
then
had
been
always
on
his
lips
although
she
had
never
dreamed
that
it
could
have
such
meaning
to
her
long
after
she
had
established
herself
in
her
berth
solitary
and
wakeful
the
verses
made
rhythm
with
the
beat
of
the
vago
augelletto
che
cantando
vai
they
were
already
far
on
their
way
flying
up
the
frozen
stream
of
the
hudson
before
she
was
left
alone
with
her
thoughts
in
the
noisy
quiet
of
the
rushing
train
she
could
not
even
hope
to
sleep
propping
herself
up
against
the
pillows
she
raised
the
curtain
of
her
window
and
stared
into
the
black
void
outside
nothing
in
nature
could
be
more
mysterious
and
melancholy
than
this
dark
polar
world
beside
which
a
winter
storm
on
the
atlantic
was
at
least
exciting
on
the
ocean
the
forces
of
nature
have
it
their
own
way
nothing
comes
between
man
and
the
elements
but
as
esther
gazed
out
into
the
night
it
was
not
the
darkness
or
the
sense
of
cold
or
the
vagrant
driving
against
the
window
or
the
heavy
clouds
drifting
through
the
sky
or
even
the
ghastly
glimmer
and
reflection
of
the
that
by
contrast
made
the
grave
seem
cheerful
it
was
rather
the
twinkling
lights
from
distant
and
invisible
the
vague
outlines
of
and
fences
along
doubtful
roads
the
sudden
flash
of
lamps
as
the
train
hurried
through
unknown
stations
or
the
unfamiliar
places
where
it
stopped
while
the
of
the
hammers
on
the
wheels
beneath
sounded
like
these
signs
of
life
behind
the
veil
were
like
the
steady
lights
of
shore
to
the
drowning
fisherman
off
the
reef
outside
every
kerosene
lamp
whose
rays
struggled
from
distant
farms
brought
a
picture
of
peace
and
hope
to
esther
not
one
of
these
invisible
roofs
but
might
shelter
some
realized
romance
some
contented
love
in
so
dark
and
dreary
a
world
what
a
mad
act
it
was
to
fly
from
the
only
happiness
life
offered
what
a
strange
idea
to
seek
safety
by
refusing
the
only
protection
worth
having
love
was
all
in
all
esther
had
never
before
felt
herself
so
helpless
as
in
the
face
of
this
outer
darkness
and
if
her
lover
had
now
been
there
to
claim
her
she
would
have
dropped
into
his
arms
as
unresistingly
as
a
tired
child
as
the
night
wore
on
the
darkness
and
desolation
became
intolerable
and
she
shut
them
out
only
to
find
herself
suffocated
by
the
imprisonment
of
her
hour
after
hour
dragged
on
the
little
excitement
of
leaving
albany
was
long
past
and
the
train
was
wandering
through
the
dullness
of
central
new
york
when
at
last
a
faint
suspicion
of
dim
light
appeared
in
the
landscape
and
esther
returned
to
her
window
if
any
thing
could
be
drearier
than
the
blackness
of
night
it
was
the
grayness
of
dawn
which
had
all
the
cold
terror
of
death
and
all
the
grim
repulsiveness
of
life
joined
in
an
hour
of
despair
esther
could
now
see
the
outlines
of
as
the
train
glided
on
roofs
and
sheds
long
stretches
of
field
with
fences
buried
to
their
top
rails
in
sweeping
in
the
houses
lights
showed
that
toil
had
begun
again
smoke
rose
from
the
chimneys
figures
moved
in
the
a
sleigh
could
be
seen
on
a
decided
road
the
world
became
real
prosaic
practical
mechanical
not
worth
struggling
about
a
mere
colorless
passionless
pleasureless
grayness
as
the
mystery
vanished
the
pain
passed
and
the
brain
grew
heavy
eyelids
drooped
and
she
sank
at
last
into
a
sleep
so
sound
that
there
was
hardly
need
for
catherine
to
stand
sentry
before
her
berth
and
frown
the
car
into
silence
the
sun
was
high
above
the
horizon
the
sky
was
bright
and
blue
the
snowy
landscape
flashed
with
the
sparkle
of
diamonds
when
esther
woke
and
it
was
with
a
cry
of
pleasure
that
she
felt
her
spirits
answer
the
sun
meanwhile
her
flight
was
no
secret
as
the
train
that
carried
her
off
drew
out
of
the
great
station
into
the
darkness
for
its
long
journey
of
three
thousand
miles
two
notes
were
delivered
to
gentlemen
only
a
few
squares
away
strong
at
his
club
received
one
from
murray
we
all
start
for
clifton
at
nine
come
and
bring
a
companion
if
you
can
we
need
to
be
amused
the
reverend
stephen
hazard
received
the
other
note
which
was
still
more
brief
but
long
enough
to
strike
him
with
panic
for
it
contained
two
words
esther
no
sooner
did
strong
receive
his
missive
than
he
set
himself
in
active
motion
wharton
who
commonly
dined
at
the
club
was
so
near
that
strong
had
only
to
pass
the
note
over
to
him
whether
wharton
was
still
suffering
from
the
shock
of
his
wife
appearance
or
disappearance
or
whether
he
was
on
the
for
some
chance
to
see
again
his
friend
catherine
or
whether
he
found
it
pleasanter
to
take
a
holiday
than
to
attack
his
long
arrears
of
work
the
idea
of
running
up
to
niagara
for
sunday
happened
to
strike
him
as
pleasant
and
he
promised
to
join
strong
at
the
erie
station
in
the
morning
strong
knew
him
too
well
to
count
on
his
keeping
the
engagement
but
could
do
no
more
and
they
both
left
the
club
to
make
their
preparations
strong
had
another
duty
before
stirring
further
he
must
talk
with
hazard
the
affair
was
rapidly
taking
a
shape
that
might
embarrass
them
both
going
directly
to
hazard
house
he
burst
into
the
library
where
he
found
his
friend
trying
to
work
in
spite
of
the
heavy
load
on
his
mind
throwing
him
murray
note
strong
waited
without
a
word
while
hazard
read
it
more
eagerly
than
though
it
had
been
a
summons
to
a
bishopric
the
mysterious
which
had
arrived
but
a
few
minutes
before
had
upset
his
nerves
and
at
first
the
note
which
strong
brought
reassured
him
for
he
thought
that
murray
was
earning
out
his
own
wishes
and
drawing
esther
nearer
to
him
then
we
have
succeeded
he
cried
not
much
said
strong
dryly
it
is
a
genuine
flight
and
escape
in
all
the
forms
you
are
and
your
line
of
attack
is
left
all
in
the
air
i
shall
follow
said
hazard
doggedly
no
good
they
are
in
earnest
replied
strong
so
am
i
answered
the
clergyman
sharply
while
strong
threw
himself
into
a
chair
as
ever
and
said
come
along
then
will
you
go
up
with
wharton
and
me
by
the
early
train
yes
replied
hazard
quickly
then
he
paused
there
were
limits
to
his
power
and
he
began
to
feel
them
no
he
went
on
i
ca
get
away
i
must
wait
till
sunday
night
better
wait
altogether
said
strong
you
take
the
chances
against
you
i
told
her
i
should
follow
her
and
i
shall
repeated
hazard
stiffly
he
felt
hurt
as
though
esther
had
rebelled
against
his
authority
and
he
was
not
well
pleased
that
strong
should
volunteer
advice
give
me
my
orders
then
said
strong
can
i
do
any
thing
for
you
i
shall
be
there
on
monday
afternoon
telegraph
me
if
they
should
decide
to
leave
the
place
earlier
try
and
keep
them
quiet
till
i
get
there
shall
i
tell
them
you
are
coming
not
for
your
life
answered
hazard
impatiently
do
all
you
can
to
soothe
and
quiet
her
hint
that
in
my
place
you
would
come
try
to
make
her
hope
it
but
not
fear
it
i
will
do
all
that
to
the
letter
said
strong
i
feel
partly
responsible
for
getting
you
and
esther
into
this
scrape
and
am
ready
to
go
a
long
way
to
pull
you
through
but
this
done
i
stop
if
esther
is
in
earnest
i
must
stand
by
her
is
that
square
hazard
frowned
severely
and
hesitated
the
real
struggle
is
just
coming
said
he
if
you
keep
out
of
the
way
i
shall
win
so
far
i
have
never
failed
with
her
my
influence
over
her
is
greater
than
ever
or
she
would
not
try
to
run
away
from
it
if
you
interfere
i
shall
think
it
unkind
and
unfriendly
to
this
strong
answered
pleasantly
enough
but
as
though
his
mind
were
quite
made
up
i
do
mean
to
interfere
if
i
can
help
it
but
i
persecute
esther
if
it
is
going
to
make
her
unhappy
as
it
is
i
am
likely
to
catch
a
scoring
from
my
aunt
for
bringing
you
down
on
them
and
undoing
her
work
i
wish
i
were
clear
of
the
whole
matter
and
esther
were
a
pillar
of
the
church
with
this
declaration
of
contingent
neutrality
strong
went
his
way
and
as
he
walked
musingly
back
to
his
rooms
he
muttered
to
himself
that
he
had
done
quite
as
much
for
hazard
as
the
case
would
warrant
what
a
trump
the
girl
is
and
what
a
good
fight
she
is
making
i
believe
i
am
getting
to
be
in
love
with
her
myself
and
if
he
gives
it
up
hum
yes
if
he
gives
it
up
then
of
course
esther
will
go
abroad
and
forget
it
hazard
solitary
thoughts
were
not
quite
so
pointless
the
danger
of
disappointment
and
defeat
roused
in
him
the
instinct
of
martyrdom
he
was
sure
that
all
mankind
would
suffer
if
he
failed
to
get
the
particular
wife
he
wanted
it
is
not
a
selfish
struggle
he
thought
it
is
a
human
soul
i
am
trying
to
save
and
i
will
do
it
in
the
teeth
of
all
the
powers
of
darkness
if
i
can
but
set
right
this
systematically
misguided
conscience
the
task
is
done
it
is
the
affair
of
a
moment
when
once
the
light
comes
a
flash
a
miracle
if
i
can
not
wield
this
fire
from
heaven
i
am
unfit
to
touch
it
let
it
burn
me
up
early
the
next
morning
not
a
little
to
their
own
surprise
strong
and
wharton
found
themselves
dashing
over
the
erie
road
towards
buffalo
they
had
a
long
day
before
them
and
luckily
wharton
was
in
his
best
spirits
as
for
strong
he
was
always
in
good
spirits
within
the
memory
of
man
well
or
ill
on
sea
or
shore
in
peril
or
safety
strong
had
never
been
seen
unhappy
or
depressed
he
had
the
faculty
of
interesting
himself
without
an
effort
in
the
doings
of
his
neighbors
and
wharton
always
had
on
hand
some
scheme
which
was
to
make
an
epoch
in
the
history
of
art
just
now
it
was
a
question
of
a
new
academy
of
music
which
was
to
be
the
completest
product
of
architecture
and
to
combine
all
the
senses
in
delight
the
grand
opera
at
paris
was
to
be
tame
beside
it
here
he
was
to
be
tied
down
by
no
such
restraints
as
the
church
imposed
on
him
he
was
to
have
beauty
for
its
own
sake
and
to
create
the
thought
of
a
coming
world
his
decorations
should
make
a
revolution
in
the
universe
strong
entered
enthusiastically
into
his
plans
but
both
agreed
that
preliminary
studies
were
necessary
both
for
architects
and
artists
the
old
world
must
be
ransacked
to
the
depths
of
japan
and
persia
before
their
was
reached
they
had
laid
out
a
scheme
of
travel
and
study
which
would
fill
a
while
the
home
of
music
in
new
york
was
still
untouched
after
dinner
and
a
cigar
they
fought
a
prodigious
battle
over
the
influence
of
the
aryan
races
on
the
philosophy
of
art
and
then
dusk
coming
on
they
went
to
sleep
and
finished
an
agreeable
journey
at
about
midnight
when
at
last
they
drove
up
to
the
hotel
door
in
the
frosty
night
and
stamped
their
feet
chilled
by
the
from
the
station
the
cataract
near
roar
and
dim
outline
under
the
stars
did
not
prevent
them
from
warmly
greeting
murray
who
sallied
out
to
welcome
them
and
to
announce
that
their
supper
was
waiting
the
three
women
had
long
since
gone
to
bed
but
murray
staid
up
to
have
a
chat
with
the
boys
he
was
in
high
spirits
he
owned
that
he
had
enjoyed
his
trip
and
was
in
no
hurry
to
go
home
while
his
nephew
and
wharton
attacked
their
supper
he
sipped
his
scotch
whisky
and
with
the
aid
of
a
cigar
enlivened
the
feast
we
got
over
here
before
three
said
he
and
of
course
i
took
them
out
to
drive
at
once
esther
sat
in
front
with
me
and
we
let
the
horses
go
your
aunt
thinks
i
am
unsafe
with
horses
and
i
took
some
pains
to
prove
that
she
was
right
the
girls
liked
it
they
have
minded
being
tipped
into
a
but
i
thought
it
would
be
rough
on
your
aunt
so
i
brought
them
home
safe
gave
them
a
dinner
and
sent
them
off
to
bed
hours
ago
sleepy
as
gods
you
must
take
them
in
hand
i
have
made
what
the
newspapers
call
my
most
brilliant
forensic
effort
and
i
not
risk
my
reputation
again
keep
out
of
our
way
then
said
strong
wharton
and
i
mean
to
spill
those
two
girls
over
the
cliff
unless
canadian
horses
know
geology
esther
slept
soundly
that
night
while
the
roar
of
the
waters
lulled
her
slumbers
the
sun
woke
her
the
next
morning
to
a
sense
of
new
life
her
room
looked
down
on
the
cataract
and
she
had
already
taken
a
fancy
to
this
tremendous
rushing
roaring
companion
which
thundered
and
smoked
under
her
window
as
though
she
had
tamed
a
tornado
to
play
in
her
to
brush
her
hair
while
such
a
confidant
looked
on
and
asked
questions
was
more
than
pallas
athene
herself
could
do
though
she
looked
out
forever
from
the
windows
of
her
acropolis
over
the
blue
ægean
the
sea
is
capricious
fickle
angry
fawning
violent
savage
and
wanton
it
caresses
and
raves
in
a
breath
and
has
its
moods
of
silence
but
esther
huge
playmate
rambled
on
with
its
story
in
the
same
steady
voice
never
shrill
or
angry
never
silent
or
degraded
by
a
sign
of
human
failings
and
yet
so
frank
and
sympathetic
that
she
had
no
choice
but
to
like
it
even
if
it
had
nothing
to
tell
me
its
manners
are
divine
said
esther
to
herself
as
she
leaned
against
the
window
sash
and
looked
out
and
its
dress
she
ran
on
what
a
complexion
to
stand
dazzling
white
and
diamonds
in
the
full
sunlight
yet
it
was
not
the
manners
or
the
dress
of
her
new
friend
that
most
won
esther
heart
her
excitement
and
the
strain
of
the
last
month
had
left
her
subject
to
her
nerves
and
imagination
she
was
startled
by
a
was
reckless
and
timid
by
turns
and
her
fancy
ran
riot
in
dreams
of
love
and
pain
she
fell
in
love
with
the
cataract
and
turned
to
it
as
a
confidant
not
because
of
its
beauty
or
power
but
because
it
seemed
to
tell
her
a
story
which
she
longed
to
understand
i
think
i
do
understand
it
she
said
to
herself
as
she
looked
out
if
he
could
only
hear
it
as
i
do
and
of
course
he
was
mr
hazard
how
he
would
feel
it
she
felt
tears
roll
down
her
face
as
she
listened
to
the
voice
of
the
waters
and
knew
that
they
were
telling
her
a
different
secret
from
any
that
hazard
could
ever
hear
he
will
think
it
is
the
church
talking
sad
as
she
was
she
smiled
as
she
thought
that
it
was
sunday
morning
and
a
ludicrous
contrast
flashed
on
her
mind
between
the
decorations
of
john
with
its
parterre
of
nineteenth
century
bonnets
and
the
huge
church
which
was
thundering
its
gospel
under
her
eyes
to
have
niagara
for
a
rival
is
no
joke
hazard
spoke
with
no
such
authority
and
esther
next
idea
was
one
of
wonder
how
after
listening
here
any
preacher
could
have
the
confidence
to
preach
again
what
do
they
know
about
it
she
asked
herself
which
of
them
can
tell
a
story
like
this
or
a
millionth
part
of
it
to
dilute
it
in
words
and
translate
bits
of
it
for
or
to
patronize
it
by
defense
or
praise
was
somewhat
as
though
esther
herself
should
paint
a
row
of
her
saints
on
the
cliff
under
table
rock
even
to
fret
about
her
own
love
affairs
in
such
company
was
an
impertinence
when
eternity
infinity
and
omnipotence
seem
to
be
laughing
and
dancing
in
one
face
it
is
well
to
treat
such
visitors
civilly
for
they
come
rarely
in
such
a
humor
so
much
did
these
thoughts
interest
and
amuse
her
that
she
took
infinite
pains
with
her
toilet
in
order
to
honor
her
colossal
host
whose
own
toilet
was
sparkling
with
all
the
jewels
of
nature
like
an
indian
prince
whose
robes
are
crusted
with
diamonds
and
pearls
when
she
came
down
to
the
strong
who
was
alone
there
looked
up
with
a
start
why
esther
he
broke
out
take
care
or
one
of
these
days
you
will
be
handsome
catherine
too
was
pretty
as
a
fawn
and
was
so
honestly
pleased
to
meet
wharton
again
that
he
expanded
into
geniality
as
for
broken
hearts
no
young
woman
shows
such
an
ornament
at
any
well
regulated
they
are
kept
in
dark
drawers
and
closets
like
other
broken
furniture
esther
had
made
the
deadliest
resolution
to
let
no
trace
of
her
unhappiness
appear
before
her
uncle
and
murray
who
saw
no
deeper
than
other
men
into
the
was
delighted
with
the
gayety
of
the
table
and
proud
of
his
own
success
as
a
physician
for
heart
complaints
murray
who
knew
more
about
her
own
sex
kept
her
eye
on
the
two
girls
with
more
anxiety
than
she
cared
to
confess
if
any
new
disaster
should
happen
the
prospect
would
be
desperate
and
it
was
useless
to
deny
that
she
had
taken
risks
heavy
enough
to
stagger
a
professional
gambler
the
breakfast
table
looked
gay
and
happy
enough
and
so
did
the
rapids
which
sparkled
and
laughed
in
the
distance
after
breakfast
the
two
young
women
with
much
preparation
of
boots
veils
and
wraps
went
off
with
strong
and
wharton
for
a
stroll
down
to
the
banks
of
the
river
the
two
older
members
of
the
party
remained
quietly
in
their
parlor
thinking
that
the
young
people
would
get
on
better
by
themselves
as
the
four
wandered
down
the
road
murray
watched
them
and
noticed
the
natural
way
in
which
esther
joined
strong
while
catherine
fell
to
wharton
standing
with
his
hands
in
his
trousers
pockets
and
his
nose
close
to
the
murray
looked
after
them
as
they
disappeared
down
the
bank
and
then
without
turning
round
he
made
a
remark
as
husbands
do
addressed
to
the
universe
and
intended
for
his
wife
i
suppose
that
is
what
you
are
driving
at
what
asked
murray
i
do
mind
george
and
esther
but
i
grudge
catherine
to
that
man
wharton
he
may
be
a
good
artist
but
i
think
his
merits
as
a
husband
beneath
criticism
i
believe
every
woman
would
connive
at
a
love
affair
though
the
man
had
half
a
dozen
living
wives
and
had
been
hung
two
or
three
times
for
murder
i
wish
esther
were
as
safe
as
i
think
catherine
said
murray
it
would
surprise
me
very
much
if
catherine
took
wharton
now
but
if
mr
hazard
were
to
walk
round
the
corner
i
should
expect
to
see
esther
run
straight
into
his
arms
hazard
exclaimed
murray
i
thought
he
was
out
of
the
running
and
you
meant
esther
for
george
i
am
not
a
and
i
no
idea
that
esther
will
ever
marry
george
replied
murray
with
the
patience
which
wives
sometimes
show
to
husbands
whom
they
think
obtuse
then
what
is
it
you
want
asked
murray
with
some
signs
of
rebellion
but
still
talking
to
the
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
you
encourage
a
set
of
clever
men
to
hang
round
two
pretty
girls
and
you
profess
at
the
same
time
not
to
want
anything
to
come
of
it
that
kind
of
conduct
strikes
an
ordinary
mind
as
inconsistent
i
want
to
prevent
one
unhappy
marriage
not
to
make
two
replied
his
wife
girls
must
have
an
education
and
the
only
way
they
can
get
a
good
one
is
from
clever
men
as
for
falling
in
love
they
will
always
do
that
whether
the
men
are
clever
or
not
they
must
take
the
risk
and
what
do
you
mean
to
do
with
them
when
they
educated
inquired
he
i
mean
them
to
marry
dull
steady
men
in
wall
street
without
any
manners
and
with
their
hands
in
their
pockets
answered
murray
her
severity
for
once
mingled
with
a
touch
of
sweetness
thank
you
replied
her
husband
at
last
turning
round
then
that
is
to
be
the
fruit
of
all
this
i
am
sure
it
is
quite
fruit
enough
rejoined
she
the
business
of
educating
their
husbands
will
take
all
the
rest
of
their
lives
murray
reflected
a
few
minutes
standing
with
his
back
to
the
fire
and
gazing
at
his
wife
then
he
said
sarah
you
are
a
clever
woman
if
you
would
come
into
my
office
and
work
steadily
you
could
double
my
income
at
the
bar
but
you
need
practice
your
points
are
too
fine
you
run
too
many
risks
and
no
male
judge
would
ever
support
your
management
of
a
case
as
practice
i
grant
you
it
is
bold
and
has
much
to
recommend
it
but
in
the
law
we
can
not
look
so
far
ahead
now
why
wo
you
let
esther
marry
george
i
shall
practice
only
before
women
judges
replied
murray
and
i
will
undertake
to
say
that
i
never
should
find
one
so
stupid
as
not
to
see
that
george
is
not
at
all
the
sort
of
man
whom
a
girl
with
notions
would
marry
if
i
tried
to
make
her
do
it
i
should
be
as
as
some
men
i
know
i
suppose
you
do
mean
to
put
yourself
in
george
way
if
he
asks
her
inquired
murray
rather
anxiously
my
dear
husband
there
is
no
use
in
thinking
about
george
one
way
or
the
other
do
put
him
out
of
your
head
you
fancy
because
esther
seems
bright
this
morning
that
she
might
marry
george
now
i
can
see
a
great
deal
more
of
esther
mind
than
you
and
i
tell
you
that
it
is
all
we
can
do
to
prevent
her
from
recalling
mr
hazard
and
that
if
we
do
prevent
it
we
shall
have
to
take
her
abroad
for
at
least
two
years
before
she
gets
over
the
strain
at
this
emphatic
announcement
that
his
life
was
to
be
for
two
years
a
sacrifice
to
esther
murray
retired
again
to
his
window
and
meditated
in
a
more
subdued
spirit
he
knew
that
protest
would
avail
nothing
meanwhile
the
two
girls
were
already
down
on
the
edge
of
the
icy
river
talking
at
first
of
the
scene
which
lay
before
their
eyes
think
what
the
greeks
would
have
done
with
it
said
wharton
they
would
have
set
zeus
in
a
throne
on
table
rock
firing
away
his
lightnings
at
prometheus
under
the
fall
just
for
a
change
i
rather
like
our
way
of
sticking
advertisements
there
said
catherine
it
makes
one
feel
at
home
a
woman
feels
most
the
kind
of
human
life
in
it
said
esther
a
big
rollicking
newfoundland
dog
sort
of
humanity
said
strong
you
are
all
wrong
said
catherine
the
fall
is
a
woman
and
she
is
as
this
morning
as
if
she
were
at
church
look
at
the
coquetry
of
the
pretty
curve
where
the
water
falls
over
and
the
lace
on
the
skirt
where
it
breaks
into
foam
only
a
woman
could
do
that
and
look
so
pretty
when
she
might
just
as
easily
be
hideous
it
is
not
a
woman
it
is
a
man
broke
in
esther
vehemently
no
woman
ever
had
a
voice
like
that
she
felt
hurt
that
her
cataract
should
be
treated
as
a
woman
now
mr
wharton
cried
catherine
appealing
to
the
artist
now
you
see
i
right
and
is
sometimes
a
beauty
wharton
answered
this
original
observation
of
nature
by
a
lecture
which
may
be
read
to
more
advantage
in
his
printed
works
it
ended
by
catherine
requiring
him
to
draw
for
her
the
design
of
a
dress
which
should
have
the
soul
of
niagara
in
its
folds
and
while
he
was
engaged
in
this
labor
which
absorbed
catherine
thoughts
and
gave
her
extreme
amusement
esther
strolled
on
with
strong
and
for
nearly
an
hour
walked
up
and
down
the
road
or
leaned
against
the
rock
in
sheltered
places
where
the
sun
was
warm
at
first
they
went
on
talking
of
the
scenery
then
esther
wanted
to
know
about
the
geology
and
quickly
broke
in
on
strong
remarks
upon
this
subject
by
questions
which
led
further
and
further
away
from
it
the
river
boiled
at
their
feet
the
sun
melted
the
enormous
icicles
which
hung
from
the
precipice
behind
them
a
mass
of
frozen
spray
was
banked
up
against
the
american
fall
opposite
them
making
it
look
like
an
iceberg
and
snow
covered
every
thing
except
the
perpendicular
river
banks
and
the
dark
water
the
rainbow
hung
over
the
cataract
and
the
mist
rose
from
the
furious
waters
into
the
peace
of
the
quiet
air
you
know
what
has
happened
she
asked
strong
nodded
assent
he
was
afraid
to
tell
her
how
much
he
knew
do
you
think
i
have
done
wrong
how
can
i
tell
without
knowing
all
your
reasons
he
asked
it
looks
to
me
as
though
you
were
uncertain
of
yourself
and
cared
less
for
him
than
he
for
you
if
i
were
in
his
place
i
should
follow
you
close
up
and
refuse
to
leave
you
esther
gave
a
little
gasp
you
do
think
he
will
do
that
if
he
does
i
shall
run
away
again
why
run
away
if
you
really
want
to
get
rid
of
him
why
not
make
him
run
away
because
i
do
want
to
make
him
run
away
from
me
and
because
i
know
how
if
i
could
only
get
him
away
from
his
church
all
i
know
about
it
is
that
i
ca
be
a
clergyman
wife
but
the
moment
that
i
try
to
explain
why
he
proves
to
me
that
my
reasons
are
good
for
nothing
are
you
sure
he
not
right
asked
strong
perfectly
sure
replied
esther
earnestly
i
ca
reason
it
out
but
i
feel
it
i
believe
you
could
explain
it
if
you
would
but
when
i
asked
you
in
the
worst
of
my
trouble
you
refused
to
help
me
i
gave
you
all
the
help
i
could
and
i
am
ready
to
give
you
whatever
you
want
more
replied
strong
tell
me
what
you
think
about
religion
strong
drew
himself
together
with
a
perceptible
effort
i
think
about
it
as
little
as
possible
said
he
do
you
believe
in
a
god
not
in
a
personal
one
or
in
future
rewards
and
punishments
old
women
nursery
tales
do
you
believe
in
nothing
there
is
evidence
amounting
to
strong
probability
of
the
existence
of
two
things
said
strong
slowly
and
as
though
in
his
what
are
they
if
you
please
should
you
know
better
if
i
said
they
were
mind
and
matter
you
believe
in
nothing
else
hesitated
strong
is
it
horrible
your
doctrine
what
of
that
if
it
true
i
never
said
it
was
pleasant
do
you
expect
to
convert
any
one
to
such
a
religion
great
buddha
no
i
do
want
to
convert
any
one
i
prefer
almost
any
kind
of
religion
no
one
ever
took
up
this
doctrine
who
could
help
himself
esther
pondered
deeply
for
a
time
strong
trick
of
driving
her
to
do
what
he
wanted
was
so
old
a
habit
that
she
had
learned
to
distrust
it
at
last
she
began
again
from
another
side
you
really
mean
that
this
life
is
every
thing
and
the
future
nothing
i
never
said
so
i
rather
think
the
church
is
right
in
thinking
this
life
nothing
and
the
future
every
thing
but
you
deny
a
future
life
strong
began
to
feel
uncomfortable
he
wanted
to
defend
his
opinions
and
it
became
irksome
to
go
on
making
out
the
strongest
case
he
could
against
himself
come
said
he
do
go
beyond
what
i
said
i
only
denied
the
rewards
and
punishments
mind
i
not
say
there
is
a
future
life
but
i
deny
it
possibility
you
are
willing
to
give
us
a
chance
said
esther
rather
sarcastically
i
do
know
that
you
would
call
it
one
replied
strong
satisfied
by
esther
irony
that
he
had
now
gone
far
enough
if
our
minds
could
get
hold
of
one
abstract
truth
they
would
be
immortal
so
far
as
that
truth
is
concerned
my
trouble
is
to
find
out
how
we
can
get
hold
of
the
truth
at
all
my
trouble
is
that
i
do
think
i
understand
in
the
least
what
you
mean
replied
esther
i
thought
you
knew
enough
theology
for
that
said
george
the
thing
is
simple
enough
hazard
and
i
and
every
one
else
agree
that
thought
is
eternal
if
you
can
get
hold
of
one
true
thought
you
are
immortal
as
far
as
that
thought
goes
the
only
difficulty
is
that
every
fellow
thinks
his
thought
the
true
one
hazard
wants
you
to
believe
in
his
and
i
do
want
you
to
believe
in
mine
because
i
not
got
one
which
i
believe
in
myself
still
i
do
understand
said
esther
how
can
i
make
myself
immortal
by
taking
mr
hazard
opinions
because
then
the
truth
is
a
part
of
you
if
i
understand
paul
this
is
sound
church
doctrine
leaving
out
the
personal
part
of
the
trinity
which
hazard
insists
on
tacking
to
it
except
for
the
rubbish
i
think
i
am
so
very
far
away
from
him
continued
strong
now
assuming
that
he
had
done
what
he
could
to
set
esther
straight
and
going
on
with
the
conversation
as
though
it
had
no
longer
a
personal
interest
as
he
talked
he
poked
holes
in
the
snow
with
his
stick
as
though
what
he
said
was
for
his
own
satisfaction
and
he
were
turning
this
old
problem
over
again
in
his
mind
to
see
whether
he
could
find
any
thing
new
at
the
bottom
of
it
i
ca
see
that
my
ideas
are
so
brutally
shocking
we
may
some
day
catch
an
abstract
truth
by
the
tail
and
then
we
shall
have
our
religion
and
immortality
we
have
got
far
more
than
half
way
infinity
is
infinitely
more
intelligible
to
you
than
you
are
to
a
sponge
if
the
soul
of
a
sponge
can
grow
to
be
the
soul
of
a
darwin
why
may
we
not
all
grow
up
to
abstract
truth
what
more
do
you
want
as
he
looked
up
again
saying
these
words
without
thinking
of
interest
he
was
startled
to
see
that
this
time
she
was
listening
with
a
very
different
expression
in
her
face
she
broke
in
with
a
question
which
staggered
him
does
your
idea
mean
that
the
next
world
is
a
sort
of
great
reservoir
of
truth
and
that
what
is
true
in
us
just
pours
into
it
like
raindrops
well
said
he
alarmed
and
puzzled
the
figure
is
not
perfectly
correct
but
the
idea
is
a
little
of
that
kind
after
all
i
wonder
whether
that
may
not
be
what
niagara
has
been
telling
me
said
esther
and
she
spoke
with
an
outburst
of
energy
that
made
strong
blood
run
cold
strong
kept
his
word
about
amusing
the
two
girls
they
were
not
allowed
the
time
to
make
themselves
unhappy
restless
or
discontented
this
sunday
afternoon
he
set
out
with
a
pair
of
the
fastest
horses
to
be
got
in
the
neighborhood
and
if
these
did
not
go
several
times
over
the
cliff
it
was
as
strong
had
said
rather
their
own
good
sense
than
their
driver
which
held
them
back
catherine
who
sat
by
side
made
the
matter
worse
by
taking
the
reins
and
a
more
reckless
little
amazon
never
defied
men
even
strong
himself
at
one
moment
when
wreck
seemed
certain
asked
her
to
kindly
see
to
the
publication
of
a
posthumous
memoir
and
esther
declared
that
although
she
did
not
fear
death
she
disliked
catherine
way
of
killing
her
catherine
paid
no
attention
to
such
ribaldry
and
drove
on
like
phaeton
wharton
was
carried
away
by
the
girl
dash
and
coolness
he
wanted
to
paint
her
as
the
charioteer
of
the
cataract
they
drove
by
the
whirlpool
and
so
far
and
fast
that
when
esther
found
herself
that
night
tossing
and
feverish
in
her
bed
she
could
only
dream
that
she
was
still
skurrying
over
a
country
aching
with
jolts
and
jerks
but
unable
ever
to
stop
the
next
day
she
was
glad
to
stay
quietly
in
the
house
and
amuse
herself
with
sketching
while
the
rest
of
the
party
crossed
the
river
to
get
murray
by
the
night
train
to
new
york
and
to
waste
their
time
and
money
on
the
small
attractions
of
the
village
murray
was
forced
to
return
to
his
office
wharton
who
had
no
right
to
be
here
at
all
for
a
score
of
pressing
engagements
were
calling
for
instant
attention
in
new
york
telegraphed
simply
that
his
work
would
detain
him
several
days
longer
at
niagara
and
he
even
talked
of
returning
with
the
others
by
way
of
quebec
while
the
rest
of
the
party
were
attending
to
their
own
affairs
at
the
railway
station
and
the
telegraph
office
wharton
and
catherine
strolled
down
to
the
little
park
over
the
american
fall
and
looked
at
the
scene
from
there
catherine
in
her
furs
was
prettier
than
ever
her
fresh
color
was
brightened
by
the
red
handkerchief
she
had
tied
round
her
neck
and
her
eyes
were
more
mutinous
than
usual
as
she
leaned
over
the
parapet
and
looked
into
the
bubbling
torrent
which
leaped
into
space
at
her
feet
wharton
would
have
liked
to
carry
her
off
like
the
torrent
and
give
her
no
chance
to
resist
yet
reckless
as
he
was
he
had
still
common
sense
enough
to
understand
that
until
he
was
fairly
rid
of
one
wife
he
could
not
expect
another
to
throw
herself
into
his
arms
and
he
awkwardly
flitted
about
her
like
a
moth
about
a
lantern
unable
even
to
singe
his
wings
in
the
flame
then
it
is
decided
he
asked
you
are
really
going
abroad
i
am
really
going
to
take
esther
to
europe
for
at
least
two
years
we
want
excitement
america
is
too
tame
may
i
come
over
and
see
you
there
no
followers
are
to
be
allowed
i
have
forbidden
esther
to
think
of
them
she
must
devote
all
her
time
to
art
or
i
shall
be
severe
with
her
but
i
suppose
you
do
mean
to
devote
all
your
own
time
to
art
i
must
take
care
of
her
replied
catherine
then
i
have
got
to
write
some
more
sonnets
my
hand
is
getting
out
in
sonnets
paris
will
spoil
you
i
shall
wish
you
had
never
left
your
prairie
said
wharton
sadly
it
is
you
that
have
spoiled
me
replied
she
you
have
made
me
and
i
am
going
abroad
to
escape
your
influence
do
me
a
favor
when
you
are
there
go
to
avignon
and
vaucluse
when
you
come
to
petrarch
house
think
of
me
for
there
i
passed
the
most
hopeless
hours
of
my
life
no
i
will
not
go
there
to
be
sad
sadness
is
made
only
for
poetry
or
painting
it
is
your
affair
not
mine
i
mean
to
be
gay
try
then
said
wharton
see
for
yourself
how
far
gayety
will
carry
you
my
turn
will
come
we
all
have
to
go
over
that
cataract
and
you
will
have
to
go
over
with
the
rest
of
us
catherine
peered
down
into
the
spray
and
foam
beneath
as
though
she
were
watching
herself
fall
and
then
replied
i
shall
stay
in
the
shallowest
puddle
i
can
find
you
will
one
day
learn
to
give
up
your
own
life
and
follow
an
ideal
said
wharton
catherine
laughed
at
his
solemn
speech
with
a
boldness
that
irritated
him
men
are
always
making
themselves
into
ideals
and
expecting
women
to
follow
them
said
she
you
are
all
selfish
tell
me
now
honestly
would
you
not
sell
yourself
and
me
and
all
new
york
like
faust
in
the
opera
if
you
could
paint
one
picture
like
titian
wharton
answered
sulkily
i
would
like
to
do
it
on
faust
conditions
i
knew
it
cried
she
exultingly
if
ever
the
devil
or
any
one
else
continued
wharton
can
get
me
to
say
to
the
passing
moment
thou
art
so
fair
he
can
have
me
for
nothing
by
that
time
i
shall
be
worth
nothing
your
temper
will
be
much
sweeter
interjected
catherine
faust
made
a
bargain
that
any
man
would
be
glad
to
make
growled
wharton
it
was
not
till
he
had
no
soul
worth
taking
that
the
devil
had
a
chance
to
win
catherine
turned
on
him
suddenly
with
her
eyes
full
of
humor
then
that
is
the
bargain
you
offer
us
women
you
want
us
to
take
you
on
condition
that
we
amuse
you
and
then
you
tell
us
that
if
we
do
amuse
you
it
will
be
because
you
are
no
longer
worth
taking
thank
you
i
can
amuse
myself
better
when
we
come
home
from
europe
i
am
going
to
buy
a
cattle
ranche
in
colorado
and
run
it
myself
you
and
strong
and
mr
hazard
shall
come
out
there
and
see
it
you
will
want
me
to
take
you
on
wages
as
cowboys
i
mean
to
have
ten
thousand
head
and
when
you
see
them
you
will
say
that
they
are
better
worth
painting
than
all
the
saints
and
naiads
round
the
mediterranean
wharton
looked
earnestly
at
her
for
a
moment
before
replying
and
she
met
his
eyes
with
a
laugh
that
left
him
helpless
unless
taken
seriously
he
was
beneath
the
level
of
average
men
at
last
he
closed
the
talk
with
a
desperate
confession
of
failure
if
you
will
not
go
to
vaucluse
miss
brooke
go
at
least
to
the
british
museum
in
london
and
when
you
are
there
take
a
long
look
at
what
are
called
the
elgin
marbles
there
you
will
see
greek
warriors
killing
each
other
with
a
smile
on
their
faces
you
remind
me
of
them
you
are
like
achilles
who
answers
his
trojan
friend
prayer
for
life
by
saying
friend
you
are
no
better
than
others
i
have
killed
i
mean
to
get
miss
dudley
to
give
me
her
portrait
of
you
and
i
shall
paint
in
over
your
head
greek
philos
thane
kai
sy
and
hang
it
up
in
my
studio
to
look
at
when
i
am
in
danger
of
feeling
happy
with
this
they
rambled
back
again
towards
their
friends
and
ended
for
the
time
their
struggle
for
mastery
the
morning
was
soon
over
all
returned
to
their
hotel
and
luncheon
followed
a
silent
meal
at
which
no
one
seemed
bright
except
strong
who
felt
that
the
burden
was
beginning
to
be
a
heavy
one
had
it
not
been
for
strong
not
one
of
the
party
would
have
moved
out
of
the
house
again
that
day
but
the
professor
privately
ordered
a
sleigh
to
the
door
at
three
and
packed
his
uncle
and
aunt
into
it
together
with
catherine
and
wharton
catherine
love
of
driving
lent
her
energy
and
murray
sadly
enough
consented
to
let
her
take
the
reins
as
they
drove
away
strong
stood
on
the
porch
and
watched
them
till
they
had
disappeared
down
the
road
the
afternoon
was
cloudy
and
gray
with
flakes
of
snow
dropping
occasionally
through
a
despondent
air
after
the
sleigh
had
gone
strong
still
gazed
down
the
road
as
though
he
expected
to
see
something
but
the
road
was
bare
he
had
stayed
at
home
under
the
pretense
of
writing
letters
and
now
returned
to
the
where
esther
was
sketching
from
the
window
a
view
of
the
cataract
she
went
quietly
on
with
her
work
while
he
sat
down
to
write
as
well
as
his
conscience
would
allow
him
for
now
that
he
saw
how
much
good
esther
escape
had
done
her
how
quiet
she
had
become
again
and
how
her
look
of
trouble
had
vanished
leaving
only
a
tender
little
air
of
gravity
as
she
worked
in
the
silence
of
her
memories
and
when
he
thought
how
violently
this
serenity
was
likely
to
be
disturbed
his
conscience
smote
him
he
bitterly
regretted
his
interference
and
roundly
denounced
himself
for
a
fool
does
wharton
really
care
for
catherine
asked
esther
as
she
went
on
with
her
sketch
i
guess
he
thinks
he
does
answered
strong
he
looks
at
her
as
though
he
would
eat
her
what
a
pity
he
is
tough
do
waste
sympathy
on
him
if
she
took
him
he
would
make
her
a
slave
within
a
week
as
it
is
his
passion
will
go
into
his
painting
she
is
a
practical
young
savage
said
esther
i
thought
at
one
time
she
was
dazzled
by
him
but
the
moment
she
saw
how
unfit
she
was
for
such
a
man
she
gave
it
up
without
a
pang
i
do
see
her
unfitness
replied
strong
she
has
plenty
of
beauty
more
common
sense
than
he
and
some
money
which
would
help
him
amazingly
except
that
he
would
soon
spend
it
i
should
say
it
was
he
who
wanted
fitness
but
you
ca
harness
a
mustang
with
a
unicorn
he
wants
me
to
study
in
paris
said
esther
but
i
mean
to
go
to
rome
and
venice
i
am
afraid
to
tell
him
when
do
you
expect
to
be
there
some
time
in
may
if
we
can
get
any
one
to
take
us
perhaps
i
will
look
you
up
in
the
summer
if
i
do
not
go
to
oregon
i
may
run
over
to
germany
we
shall
be
terribly
homesick
replied
esther
silence
now
followed
till
strong
finished
his
letters
and
looked
again
at
his
watch
it
was
four
if
he
is
coming
thought
strong
it
is
time
he
were
here
but
i
would
draw
him
a
check
for
his
church
if
he
would
stay
away
the
jingling
of
made
itself
heard
on
the
road
below
as
though
to
rebuke
him
and
presently
a
cry
of
fright
from
esther
at
the
window
told
that
she
knew
what
was
before
her
what
shall
i
do
she
cried
breathlessly
here
he
is
i
ca
see
him
i
ca
go
through
that
scene
again
george
wo
you
stop
him
what
under
the
sun
are
you
afraid
of
said
strong
he
not
shoot
you
if
you
do
mean
to
marry
him
tell
him
so
and
this
time
make
it
clear
let
there
be
no
mistake
about
it
but
do
send
him
away
if
you
mean
to
make
yourself
unhappy
afterwards
of
course
i
am
going
to
be
unhappy
afterwards
groaned
esther
what
do
you
know
about
it
george
do
you
think
i
feel
about
him
as
you
would
about
a
lump
of
coal
i
was
just
beginning
to
be
quiet
and
peaceful
and
now
it
must
all
start
up
again
go
away
leave
us
alone
but
not
long
if
he
is
not
gone
within
an
hour
come
back
the
next
instant
the
door
opened
and
hazard
was
shown
into
the
room
his
manner
at
this
awkward
moment
was
quiet
and
as
though
he
had
made
it
the
business
of
his
life
to
chase
flying
maidens
having
taken
his
own
time
he
was
not
to
be
thrown
off
his
balance
by
any
ordinary
chance
he
nodded
familiarly
to
strong
who
left
the
room
as
he
entered
and
walking
straight
to
esther
held
out
his
hand
with
a
look
of
entreaty
harder
for
her
to
resist
than
any
form
of
reproach
i
told
you
that
i
should
follow
he
said
she
drew
back
raising
her
hand
to
check
him
and
putting
on
what
she
intended
for
a
forbidding
expression
it
is
my
own
fault
i
should
have
spoken
more
plainly
she
replied
instead
of
taking
up
the
challenge
hazard
turned
to
the
table
where
her
unfinished
drawing
lay
what
a
good
sketch
he
said
bending
over
it
but
you
have
not
yet
caught
the
real
fall
i
never
saw
an
artist
that
had
esther
defense
was
disconcerted
by
this
attack
hazard
was
bent
on
getting
back
to
his
old
familiar
ground
and
she
let
him
take
it
her
last
hope
was
that
he
might
be
willing
to
take
it
and
be
made
content
with
it
if
she
could
but
persuade
him
to
forget
what
had
passed
and
return
to
the
footing
of
friendship
which
ought
never
to
have
been
left
this
was
what
she
was
made
for
her
courage
rose
as
she
thought
that
perhaps
this
was
possible
and
as
he
sat
down
before
the
drawing
and
discussed
it
she
fancied
that
her
object
was
already
gained
and
that
this
young
greyhound
at
her
elbow
could
be
held
in
a
leash
and
made
to
obey
a
sign
in
a
few
minutes
he
had
taken
again
his
old
friendly
place
and
if
she
did
not
treat
him
with
all
the
old
familiarity
he
still
gained
ground
enough
to
warrant
him
in
believing
more
firmly
than
ever
that
she
could
not
resist
his
influence
so
long
as
he
was
at
her
side
they
ran
on
together
in
talk
about
the
drawing
until
he
felt
that
he
might
risk
another
approach
and
his
way
of
doing
it
was
almost
too
easy
and
dexterous
what
you
want
to
get
into
your
picture
he
was
saying
is
the
air
which
the
fall
has
of
being
something
final
you
ca
go
beyond
niagara
the
universe
seems
made
for
it
whenever
i
come
here
i
find
myself
repeating
our
sonnet
eterna
vita
e
veder
dio
for
the
sight
of
it
suggests
eternity
and
infinite
power
then
suddenly
putting
down
the
drawing
and
looking
up
to
her
face
as
she
stood
by
his
side
he
said
do
you
know
i
feel
now
for
the
first
time
the
beauty
of
the
next
two
verses
lady
sight
of
you
in
my
despair
brings
paradise
to
this
brief
life
and
frail
hush
said
esther
raising
her
hand
again
we
are
friends
now
and
nothing
more
mere
friends
are
we
quoted
hazard
with
a
courageous
smile
no
he
went
on
quickly
i
love
you
i
can
not
help
loving
you
there
is
no
friendship
about
it
if
you
tell
me
so
i
must
run
away
again
i
shall
leave
the
room
remember
i
am
terribly
serious
now
if
you
tell
me
honestly
and
seriously
that
you
love
me
no
longer
and
want
me
to
go
away
i
will
leave
the
room
myself
answered
hazard
i
wo
say
that
unless
you
force
me
to
it
but
i
expect
you
from
this
time
to
help
me
in
carrying
out
what
you
know
is
my
duty
i
will
promise
on
condition
that
you
prove
to
me
first
what
your
duty
is
to
come
back
again
to
their
starting
point
was
not
encouraging
and
they
felt
it
but
this
time
esther
was
determined
to
be
obeyed
even
if
it
cost
her
a
lover
as
well
as
a
husband
she
did
not
flinch
what
more
proof
do
you
need
i
am
not
fit
to
be
a
clergyman
wife
i
should
be
a
scandal
in
the
church
and
you
would
have
to
choose
between
it
and
me
i
know
you
better
said
hazard
calmly
you
will
find
all
your
fears
vanish
if
you
once
boldly
face
them
i
have
tried
said
esther
i
tried
desperately
and
failed
utterly
try
once
more
do
not
turn
from
all
that
has
been
the
hope
and
comfort
of
men
until
you
have
fairly
learned
what
it
is
is
it
not
enough
to
know
myself
asked
esther
some
people
are
made
with
faith
i
am
made
without
it
hazard
broke
in
here
in
a
warmer
tone
i
know
you
better
than
you
know
yourself
do
you
think
that
i
whose
business
it
is
to
witness
every
day
of
my
life
the
power
of
my
faith
am
going
to
hesitate
before
a
trifle
like
your
common
daily
fears
and
doubts
such
as
have
risen
and
been
laid
in
every
mind
that
was
worth
being
called
one
ever
since
minds
existed
have
they
always
been
laid
asked
esther
gravely
always
answered
hazard
firmly
provided
the
doubter
wanted
to
lay
them
it
is
a
simple
matter
of
will
would
you
have
gone
into
the
ministry
if
you
had
been
tormented
by
them
as
i
am
she
asked
i
am
not
afraid
to
lay
bare
my
conscience
to
you
he
replied
becoming
cool
again
and
willing
perhaps
to
stretch
his
own
points
of
conscience
in
the
effort
to
control
hers
i
suppose
the
clergyman
hardly
exists
who
has
not
been
tormented
by
doubts
as
for
myself
if
i
could
have
removed
my
doubts
by
so
simple
a
step
as
that
of
becoming
an
atheist
i
should
have
done
it
no
matter
what
scandal
or
punishment
had
followed
i
studied
the
subject
thoroughly
and
found
that
for
one
doubt
removed
another
was
raised
only
to
reach
at
last
a
result
more
inconceivable
than
that
reached
by
the
church
and
infinitely
more
hopeless
besides
what
do
you
gain
by
getting
rid
of
one
incomprehensible
only
to
put
a
greater
one
in
its
place
and
throw
away
your
only
hope
besides
the
atheists
offer
no
sort
of
bargain
for
one
soul
their
scheme
is
all
loss
and
no
gain
at
last
both
they
and
i
come
back
to
a
confession
of
ignorance
the
only
difference
between
us
is
that
my
ignorance
is
joined
with
a
faith
and
hope
esther
was
staggered
by
this
view
of
the
subject
and
had
to
fall
back
on
her
but
you
make
me
say
every
sunday
that
i
believe
in
things
i
do
believe
at
all
but
i
suppose
you
believe
at
last
in
something
do
you
not
asked
hazard
somewhere
there
must
be
common
ground
for
us
to
stand
on
and
our
church
makes
very
large
i
think
too
large
allowances
for
difference
for
my
own
part
i
accept
tradition
outright
because
i
think
it
wiser
to
receive
a
mystery
than
to
weaken
faith
but
no
one
exacts
such
strictness
from
you
there
are
scores
of
clergymen
in
our
pulpits
who
are
in
my
eyes
little
better
than
open
skeptics
yet
i
am
not
allowed
to
refuse
communion
with
them
why
should
you
refuse
it
with
me
you
must
at
last
trust
in
some
mysterious
and
humanly
incomprehensible
form
of
words
even
strong
has
to
do
this
why
may
you
not
take
mine
i
hardly
know
what
to
trust
in
said
esther
sadly
then
trust
in
me
i
wish
i
could
but
but
what
tell
me
frankly
where
your
want
of
confidence
lies
i
want
to
tell
you
but
i
afraid
this
is
what
has
stood
between
us
from
the
first
if
i
told
you
what
was
on
my
lips
you
would
think
it
an
insult
do
drive
me
into
offending
you
if
you
knew
how
much
i
want
to
keep
your
friendship
you
would
not
force
me
to
say
such
things
i
will
not
be
offended
answered
hazard
gayly
i
can
stand
almost
any
thing
except
being
told
that
you
no
longer
love
me
it
wrung
esther
heart
to
throw
away
a
love
so
pure
and
devoted
she
felt
ashamed
of
her
fears
and
of
herself
as
he
spoke
her
ears
seemed
to
hear
a
running
echo
mistress
know
yourself
down
on
your
knees
and
thank
heaven
fasting
for
a
good
man
love
she
sat
some
moments
silent
while
he
gazed
into
her
face
and
her
eyes
wandered
out
to
the
gloomy
and
cataract
she
felt
herself
being
swept
over
it
whichever
way
she
moved
she
had
to
look
down
into
an
abyss
and
leap
spare
me
she
said
at
last
why
should
you
drive
and
force
me
to
take
this
leap
are
all
men
so
tyrannical
with
women
you
do
not
quarrel
with
a
man
because
he
can
not
give
you
his
whole
life
i
own
it
said
hazard
warmly
i
am
tyrannical
i
want
your
whole
life
and
even
more
i
will
be
put
off
with
nothing
else
do
you
see
that
i
ca
retreat
put
yourself
in
my
place
think
how
you
would
act
if
you
loved
me
as
i
love
you
ah
be
generous
begged
esther
it
is
not
my
fault
if
you
and
your
profession
are
one
and
of
all
things
on
earth
to
be
must
be
the
worst
torture
you
are
perfectly
right
he
replied
my
profession
and
i
are
one
and
this
makes
my
case
harder
for
i
have
to
fight
two
battles
one
of
love
and
one
of
duty
think
for
a
moment
what
a
struggle
it
is
i
love
you
passionately
i
would
like
to
say
to
you
me
on
your
own
terms
i
will
give
you
my
life
as
i
will
take
yours
but
how
can
i
you
are
trembling
on
the
verge
of
what
i
think
destruction
if
i
saw
you
tossing
on
the
rapids
yonder
at
the
edge
of
the
fall
i
could
not
be
more
eager
to
save
you
yet
think
what
i
have
had
to
exercise
for
though
i
have
felt
myself
for
weeks
fighting
a
battle
of
life
and
death
for
a
soul
much
dearer
to
me
than
my
own
i
have
gone
forward
as
though
i
felt
no
alarm
i
have
never
even
spoken
to
you
on
the
subject
i
stood
by
believing
so
entirely
in
you
that
i
dared
let
your
own
nature
redeem
itself
but
now
you
throw
out
a
challenge
and
i
have
no
choice
but
to
meet
it
i
have
got
to
fight
for
myself
and
my
profession
and
you
at
the
same
time
at
last
then
the
battle
was
fairly
joined
and
desperately
as
both
the
lovers
had
struggled
against
it
they
looked
their
destiny
in
the
face
with
all
esther
love
and
sympathy
for
hazard
and
with
all
the
subtle
power
which
his
presence
had
on
her
will
his
last
speech
was
unlucky
here
was
what
she
had
feared
she
seemed
to
feel
now
what
she
had
only
vaguely
suspected
before
the
restraint
which
would
be
put
upon
her
the
moment
she
should
submit
to
his
will
he
had
as
good
as
avowed
that
nothing
but
the
fear
of
losing
her
had
kept
him
silent
she
fancied
that
the
thunders
of
the
church
were
already
rolling
over
her
head
and
that
her
mind
was
already
slowly
shutting
itself
up
under
the
checks
of
its
new
surroundings
hazard
speech
too
was
unlucky
in
another
way
if
he
had
tried
not
to
shock
her
by
taking
charge
of
her
soul
before
she
asked
for
his
interference
she
had
herself
made
a
superhuman
effort
not
to
shock
him
and
never
once
had
she
let
drop
a
word
that
could
offend
his
prejudices
since
the
truth
must
now
come
out
she
was
the
less
anxious
to
spare
his
pride
because
he
claimed
credit
for
respecting
hers
must
you
know
why
i
have
broken
down
and
run
away
she
said
at
last
well
i
will
tell
you
it
was
because
after
a
violent
struggle
with
myself
i
found
i
could
not
enter
a
church
without
a
feeling
of
of
hostility
i
can
only
be
friendly
by
staying
away
from
it
i
felt
as
though
it
were
part
of
a
different
world
you
will
be
angry
with
me
for
saying
it
but
i
never
saw
you
conduct
a
service
without
feeling
as
though
you
were
a
priest
in
a
pagan
temple
centuries
apart
from
me
at
any
moment
i
half
expected
to
see
you
bring
out
a
goat
or
a
ram
and
sacrifice
it
on
the
high
altar
how
could
i
with
such
ideas
join
you
at
communion
no
wonder
that
esther
should
have
hesitated
her
little
speech
was
not
meant
in
ridicule
of
hazard
but
it
stung
him
to
the
quick
he
started
up
and
walked
across
the
room
to
the
window
where
he
stood
a
moment
trying
to
recover
his
composure
what
you
call
pagan
is
to
me
proof
of
an
eternal
truth
handed
down
by
tradition
and
divine
revelation
he
said
at
length
but
the
mere
ceremonies
need
not
stand
in
your
way
surely
you
can
disregard
them
and
feel
the
truths
behind
oh
yes
answered
esther
plunging
still
deeper
into
the
morass
the
ceremonies
are
picturesque
and
i
could
get
used
to
them
but
the
doctrines
are
more
pagan
than
the
ceremonies
now
i
have
hurt
your
feelings
enough
and
will
say
no
more
what
i
have
said
proves
that
i
am
not
fit
to
be
your
wife
let
me
go
in
peace
again
hazard
thought
a
moment
with
a
grave
face
then
he
said
every
church
is
open
to
the
same
kind
of
attack
you
make
on
ours
do
you
mean
to
separate
yourself
from
all
communion
if
you
will
create
a
new
one
that
shall
be
really
spiritual
and
not
cry
flesh
flesh
at
every
corner
i
will
gladly
join
it
and
give
my
whole
life
to
you
and
it
hazard
shook
his
head
i
can
suggest
nothing
more
spiritual
than
what
came
from
the
spirit
itself
and
has
from
all
time
satisfied
the
purest
and
most
spiritual
souls
if
i
could
make
myself
contented
with
what
satisfied
them
i
would
do
it
for
your
sake
answered
esther
it
must
be
that
we
are
in
a
new
world
now
for
i
can
see
nothing
spiritual
about
the
church
it
is
all
personal
and
selfish
what
difference
does
it
make
to
me
whether
i
worship
one
person
or
three
persons
or
three
hundred
or
three
thousand
i
ca
understand
how
you
worship
any
person
at
all
hazard
literally
groaned
and
his
involuntary
expression
so
irritated
esther
that
she
ran
on
still
more
recklessly
do
you
really
believe
in
the
resurrection
of
the
body
she
asked
of
course
i
do
replied
hazard
stiffly
to
me
it
seems
a
shocking
idea
i
despise
and
loathe
myself
and
yet
you
thrust
self
at
me
from
every
corner
of
the
church
as
though
i
loved
and
admired
it
all
religion
does
nothing
but
pursue
me
with
self
even
into
the
next
world
esther
had
become
very
animated
in
the
course
of
her
remarks
and
not
the
less
so
because
she
saw
hazard
frown
and
make
gestures
of
impatience
as
she
passed
from
one
sacrilege
to
another
at
last
he
turned
at
bay
and
broke
out
do
you
think
all
this
is
new
to
me
i
know
by
heart
all
these
criticisms
of
the
church
i
have
heard
them
in
one
form
and
another
ever
since
i
was
a
boy
at
school
they
are
all
equally
poor
and
ignorant
they
touch
no
vital
point
for
they
are
made
by
men
like
your
cousin
george
strong
from
whom
i
suppose
you
got
them
who
know
nothing
of
the
church
or
its
doctrines
or
its
history
i
not
argue
over
them
let
them
go
for
whatever
you
may
think
they
are
worth
i
will
only
put
to
you
one
question
and
no
more
if
you
answer
it
against
me
i
will
go
away
and
never
annoy
you
again
you
say
the
idea
of
the
resurrection
is
shocking
to
you
can
you
without
feeling
still
more
shocked
think
of
a
future
existence
where
you
will
not
meet
once
more
father
or
mother
husband
or
children
surely
the
natural
instincts
of
your
sex
must
save
you
from
such
a
creed
ah
cried
esther
almost
fiercely
and
blushing
crimson
as
though
hazard
this
time
had
pierced
the
last
restraint
on
her
why
must
the
church
always
appeal
to
my
weakness
and
never
to
my
strength
i
ask
for
spiritual
life
and
you
send
me
back
to
my
flesh
and
blood
as
though
i
were
a
tigress
you
were
sending
back
to
her
cubs
what
is
the
use
of
appealing
to
my
sex
the
atheists
at
least
show
me
respect
enough
not
to
do
that
at
this
moment
the
door
opened
and
strong
entered
it
was
high
time
the
scene
threatened
to
become
almost
violent
as
strong
came
in
esther
was
standing
by
the
all
her
restless
features
flashing
with
the
excitement
of
her
last
speech
hazard
with
his
back
to
the
window
was
looking
at
her
across
the
room
his
face
dark
with
displeasure
as
strong
stepped
between
them
a
momentary
silence
followed
when
not
a
sound
was
heard
except
the
low
thunder
of
the
falling
waters
one
would
have
said
that
storm
was
in
the
air
suddenly
hazard
turned
on
the
unlucky
professor
and
hurled
at
him
the
lightning
you
are
the
cause
of
all
this
what
is
your
motive
strong
looked
at
him
with
surprise
but
understood
in
a
moment
what
had
happened
seeing
himself
destined
in
any
case
to
be
the
victim
of
the
coming
wrath
he
quietly
made
up
his
mind
to
bear
the
lot
of
all
mediators
and
i
am
afraid
you
are
half
right
he
answered
my
stupidity
may
have
made
matters
a
little
worse
what
was
your
motive
repeated
hazard
sternly
my
motive
was
to
fight
your
battle
for
you
replied
strong
unruffled
and
i
did
it
clumsily
that
all
i
might
have
known
it
beforehand
have
you
been
trying
to
supplant
me
in
order
to
get
yourself
in
my
place
demanded
hazard
still
in
the
tone
of
a
master
no
replied
strong
half
inclined
to
laugh
you
will
never
find
happiness
there
continued
hazard
turning
to
esther
and
pointing
with
a
sweep
of
his
hand
to
strong
esther
agrees
with
you
on
that
point
said
strong
beginning
to
think
it
time
that
this
scene
should
end
i
do
mind
telling
you
too
that
since
i
have
seen
her
stand
out
against
your
persecution
i
would
give
any
chance
i
have
of
salvation
if
she
would
marry
me
but
you
need
be
alarmed
about
it
she
wo
she
will
broke
in
hazard
abruptly
you
have
betrayed
me
and
your
conduct
is
all
of
a
piece
with
your
theories
then
turning
to
esther
who
still
stood
motionless
and
silent
before
the
fire
he
went
on
i
am
beaten
you
have
driven
me
away
and
i
will
never
trouble
you
again
till
in
your
days
of
suffering
and
anguish
you
send
to
me
for
hope
and
consolation
till
then
god
bless
you
the
silence
was
awful
when
his
retreating
footsteps
could
no
longer
be
heard
it
was
peace
but
the
peace
of
despair
as
the
sound
of
the
jangling
slowly
receded
from
the
door
and
esther
realized
that
the
romance
of
her
life
was
ended
she
clasped
her
hands
together
in
a
struggle
to
control
her
tears
strong
walked
once
or
twice
up
and
down
the
room
buried
in
thought
then
suddenly
stopping
before
her
he
said
in
his
practical
way
esther
i
meant
it
you
have
fought
your
battle
like
a
heroine
if
you
will
marry
me
i
will
admire
and
love
you
more
than
ever
a
woman
was
loved
since
the
world
began
esther
looked
at
him
with
an
expression
that
would
have
been
a
smile
if
it
had
not
been
infinitely
dreary
and
absent
then
she
said
simply
and
finally
but
george
i
do
love
you
i
love
him
the
end
