from

beseech
your
graces
both
to

virtuous
and
his
noble
queen
well
struck
in
years
fair
and
not
jealous
we
say
that
shore
wife
hath
a
pretty
foot
a
cherry
lip
a
bonny
eye
a
passing
pleasing
tongue
and
that
the
queen

are
made
gentlefolks

you
deny

sweet
a
place

fouler
toad
out
of
my
sight
thou
dost
infect
mine
eyes
gloster
thine
eyes
sweet
lady
have
infected
mine
anne
would
they
were
basilisks
to
strike
thee
dead
gloster
i
would
they
were
that
i
might
die
at
once
for
now
they
kill
me
with
a
living
death
those
eyes
of
thine
from
mine
have
drawn
salt
tears
sham
their
aspects
with
store
of
childish
drops
these
eyes
which
never
shed
remorseful
tear
no
when
my
father
york
and
edward
wept
to
hear
the
piteous
moan
that
rutland
made
when
clifford
shook
his
sword
at
him
nor
when
thy
warlike
father
like
a
child
told
the
sad
story
of
my
father
death
and
twenty
times
made
pause
to
sob
and
weep
that
all
the
had
wet
their
cheeks
like
trees
bedash
with
rain
in
that
sad
time
my
manly
eyes
did
scorn
an
humble
tear
and
what
these
sorrows
could
not
thence
exhale
thy
beauty
hath
and
made
them
blind
with
weeping
i
never
su
to
friend
nor
enemy
my
tongue
could
never
learn
sweet
smoothing
word
but
now
thy
beauty
is
propos
my
fee
my
proud
heart
sues
and
prompts
my
tongue
to
speak
she
looks
scornfully
at
him
teach
not
thy
lip
such
scorn
for
it
was
made
for
kissing
lady
not
for
such
contempt
if
thy
revengeful
heart
can
not
forgive
lo
here
i
lend
thee
this
sword
which
if
thou
please
to
hide
in
this
true
breast
and
let
the
soul
forth
that
adoreth
thee
i
lay
it
naked
to
the
deadly
stroke
and
humbly
beg
the
death
upon
my
knee
nay
do
not
pause
for
i
did
kill
king
henry
he
lays
his
breast
open

offers
at
it
with
his
sword
but
was
thy
beauty
that
provoked
me
nay
now
dispatch
was
i
that
stabb
young
edward

at
his
breast
but

thy
heavenly
face

up
me

far
truer

complain
unto
the
king
that
i
forsooth
am
stern
and
love
them
not
by
holy
paul
they
love
his
grace
but
lightly
that
fill
his
ears
with
such
dissentious
rumours
because
i
can
not
flatter
and
look
fair
smile
in
men
faces
smooth
deceive
and
cog
duck
with
french
nods
and
apish
courtesy
i
must
be
held
a
rancorous
enemy
can
not
a
plain
man
live
and
think
no
harm

thus
his
simple
truth
must
be
with
silken
sly
insinuating
jacks
grey
to
who
in
all
this

speaks
your

gloster
to
thee
that
hast

injur
thee

grace
whom
god
preserve
better
than
you

not
be
quiet
scarce
a
breathing

you
must
trouble
him
with
lewd
complaints
queen
elizabeth
brother
of

you
mistake
the
matter
the

on
his
own
royal
disposition

at
your
interior
hatred

all
the

too
hot
to
do

but
then
i
sigh
and
with
a
piece
of
scripture
tell

that

thus
i
clothe
my
naked
villany

seem
a
saint
when

your
grace
so
heavily
clarence
o
i
have
pass
a
miserable
night
so
full
of
fearful
dreams
of
ugly
sights
that
as
i
am
a
christian
faithful
man
i
would
not
spend
another
such
a
night
though
to
buy
a
world
of
happy
days
so
full
of
dismal
terror
was
the
time
brakenbury
what
was
your
dream
my
lord
i
pray
you
tell
me
clarence
methoughts
that
i
had
broken
from
the
tower
and
was
embark
to
cross
to
burgundy
and
in
my
company
my
brother
gloster
who
from
my
cabin
tempted
me
to
walk
upon
the
hatches
thence
we
look
toward
england
and
cited
up
a
thousand
heavy
times
during
the
wars
of
york
and
lancaster
that
had
us
as
we
pac
along
upon
the
giddy
footing
of
the
hatches
methought
that
gloster
stumbled
and
in
falling
struck
me
that
thought
to
stay
him
overboard
into
the
tumbling
billows
of
the
main
o
lord
methought
what
pain
it
was
to
drown
what
dreadful
noise
of
waters
in
my
ears
what
sights
of
ugly
death
within
my
eyes
methoughts
i
saw
a
thousand
fearful
wrecks
a
thousand
men
that
fishes
gnaw
upon
wedges
of
gold
great
anchors
heaps
of
pearl
inestimable
stones
unvalued
jewels
all
in
the
bottom
of
the
sea
some
lay
in
dead
men
skulls
and
in
the
holes
where
eyes
did
once
inhabit
there
were
crept
as
in
scorn
of
eyes
reflecting
gems
that
woo
the
slimy
bottom
of
the
deep
and
mock
the
dead
bones
that
lay
scatter
by
brakenbury
had
you
such
leisure
in
the
time
of
death
to
gaze
upon
these
secrets
of
the
deep
clarence
methought
i
had
and
often
did
i
strive
to
yield
the
ghost
but
still
the
envious
flood
stopp
in
my
soul
and
would
not
let
it
forth
to
find
the
empty
vast
and
wandering
air
but
smother
it
within
my
panting
bulk
who
almost
burst
to
belch
it
in
the
sea
brakenbury
awak
you
not
in
this
sore
agony
clarence
no
no
my
dream
was
lengthen
after
life
o
then
began
the
tempest
to
my
soul
i
pass
methought
the
melancholy
flood
with
that
grim
ferryman
which
poets
write
of
unto
the
kingdom
of
perpetual
night
the
first
that
there
did
greet
my
stranger
soul
was
my
great
renowned
warwick
who
spake
aloud
what
scourge
for
perjury
can
this
dark
monarchy
afford
false
clarence
and
so
he
vanish
then
came
wandering
by
a
shadow
like
an
angel
with
bright
hair
dabbled
in
blood
and
he
shriek
out
aloud
clarence
is
come
false
fleeting
perjur
clarence
that
stabb
me
in
the
field
by
tewksbury
seize
on
him
furies
take
him
to
your
torments
with
that
methoughts
a
legion
of
foul
fiends
environ
me
and
howled
in
mine
ears
such
hideous
cries
that
with
the
very
noise
i
trembling
wak
and
for
a
season
after
could
not
believe
but
that
i
was
in
hell
such
terrible
impression
made
my
dream
brakenbury
no
marvel
lord
though
it
affrighted
you
i
am
afraid
methinks
to
hear
you
tell
it
clarence
ah
brakenbury
i
have
done
these
things
that
now
give
evidence
against
my
soul
for
edward
sake
and
see
how
he
requites
me
o
god
if
my
deep
prayers
can
not
appease
thee
but
thou
wilt
be
aveng
on
my
misdeeds
yet
execute
thy
wrath
in
me
alone
o
spare
my
guiltless
wife
and
my
poor
children
keeper
i
prithee
sit
by
me
awhile
my
soul
is
heavy
and
i
fain
would
sleep
brakenbury
i
will
my
lord
god
give
your
grace
good
rest
clarence
reposes
himself
on
a
chair
sorrow
breaks
seasons
and
reposing
hours
makes
the
night
morning
and
the
noontide
night
princes
have
but
their
titles
for
their
glories
an
outward
honour
for
an
inward
toil
and
for
unfelt
imaginations
they
often
feel
a
world
of
restless
cares
so
that
between
their
tides
and
low
name
there
nothing
differs
but
the
outward
fame
enter
the
two
murderers
first
murderer
ho
who
here
brakenbury
what
wouldst
thou
fellow
and
how
thou
hither
first
murderer
i
would
speak
with
clarence
and
i
came
hither
on
my
legs
brakenbury
what
so
brief
second
murderer
is
better
sir
than
to
be
let
him
see
our
commission
and
talk
no
more
a
paper
is
delivered
to
brakenbury
who
reads
it
brakenbury
i
am
in
this
commanded
to
deliver
the
noble
duke
of
clarence
to
your
hands
i
will
not
reason
what
is
meant
hereby
because
i
will
be
guiltless
of
the
meaning
there
lies
the
duke
asleep
and
there
the
keys
i
to
the
king
and
signify
to
him
that
thus
i
have
resign
to
you
my
charge
first
murderer
you
may
sir
is
a
point
of
wisdom
fare
you
well
exit
brakenbury
second
murderer
what
shall
we
stab
him
as
he
sleeps
first
murderer
no
he
say
was
done
cowardly
when
he
wakes
second
murderer
when
he
wakes
why
fool
he
shall
never
wake
until
the
great
first
murderer
why
then
he
say
we
stabb
him
sleeping
second
murderer
the
urging
of
that
word
judgment
hath
bred
a
kind
of
remorse
in
me
first
murderer
what
art
thou
afraid
second
murderer
not
to
kill
him
having
a
warrant
for
it
but
to
be
damned
for
killing
him
from
the
which
no
warrant
can
defend
me
first
murderer
i
thought
thou
hadst
been
resolute
second
murderer
so
i
am
to
let
him
live
first
murderer
i
back
to
the
duke
of
gloster
and
tell
him
so
second
murderer
nay
i
stay
a
little
i
hope
my
holy
humour
will
change
it
was
wont
to
hold
me
but
while
one
tells
twenty
first
murderer
how
dost
thou
feel
thyself
now
second
murderer
faith
some
certain
dregs
of
conscience
are
yet
within
me
first
murderer
remember
our
reward
when
the
deed
done
second
murderer
zounds
he
dies
i
had
forgot
the
reward
first
murderer
where
thy
conscience
now
second
murderer
o
in
the
duke
of
gloster
purse
first
murderer
so
when
he
opens
his
purse
to
give
us
our
reward
thy
conscience
flies
out
second
murderer
is
no
matter
let
it
go
there
few
or
none
will
entertain
it
first
murderer
what
if
it
come
to
thee
again
second
murderer
i
not
meddle
with
it
it
makes
a
man
coward
a
man
can
not
steal
but
it
accuseth
him
a
man
can
not
swear
but
it
checks
him
a
man
can
not
lie
with
his
neighbour
wife
but
it
detects
him
is
a
blushing
faced
spirit
that
mutinies
in
a
man
bosom
it
fills
a
man
full
of
obstacles
it
made
me
once
restore
a
purse
of
gold
that
by
chance
i
found
it
beggars
any
man
that
keeps
it
it
is
turned
out
of
towns
and
cities
for
a
dangerous
thing
and
every
man
that
means
to
live
well
endeavours
to
trust
to
himself
and
live
without
it
first
murderer
zounds
is
even
now
at
my
elbow
persuading
me
not
to
kill
the
duke
second
murderer
take
the
devil
in
thy
mind
and
believe
him
not
he
would
insinuate
with
thee
but
to
make

enemy
duchess
what
means
this
scene
of
rude
impatience
queen
elizabeth
to
make
an
act
of
tragic
violence
edward
my
lord
thy
son
our
king
is
why
grow
the
branches
when
the
root
is
gone
why
wither
not
the
leaves
that
want
their
sap
if
you
will
live
lament
if
die
be
brief
that
our
souls
may
catch
the
king
or
like
obedient
subjects
follow
him
to
his
new
kingdom
of
perpetual
rest

comfort
dear
mother
god
is
much
that
you
take
with
unthankfulness
his
doing
in
common
worldly
things
is
called
ungrateful
with
dull
unwillingness
to
repay
a
debt
which
with
a
bounteous
hand
was
kindly
lent
much
more
to
be
thus
opposite
with
heaven
for
it
requires
the
royal
debt
it
lent

bethink
you
like
a
careful
mother
of
the
young

your
son
send
straight
for
him
let
him
be

all
of

have
cause
to
wail
the
dimming
of

but
none
can

our
harms
by
wailing
madam
my

i
do
cry
you
mercy
i
did
not
see
your

humbly
on

i
crave
your

bless
thee

put
meekness
in

amen
aside
and
make
me
die
a
good
old
man
that
is
the
butt
end
of
a
mother
blessing
i
marvel
that
her
grace
did
leave
it
out
buckingham
you
cloudy
princes
and
peers
that
bear
this
heavy
mutual
load
of
moan
now
cheer
each
other
in
each
other
love
though
we
have
spent
our
harvest
of
this
king
we
are
to
reap
the
harvest
of
his
son
the
broken
rancour
of
your
hearts
but
lately
splinter
knit
and
join
together
must
gently
be
preserv
cherish
and
kept
me
seemeth
good
that
with
some
little
train
forthwith
from
ludlow
the
young
prince
be
fetched
hither
to
london
to
be
crown
our
king
rivers
why
with
some
little
train
my
lord
of
buckingham
buckingham
marry
my
lord
lest
by
a
multitude
the
wound
of
malice
should
break
out
which
would
be
so
much
the
more
dangerous
by
how
much
the
estate
is
green
and
yet
ungovern
where
every
horse
bears
his
commanding
rein
and
may
direct
his
course
as
please
himself
as
well
the
fear
of
harm
as
harm
apparent
in
my
opinion
ought
to
be
prevented
gloster
i
hope
the
king
made
peace
with
all
of
us
and
the
compact
is
firm
and
true
in
me
rivers
and
so
in
me
and
so
i
think
in
all
yet
since
it
is
but
green
it
should
be
put
to
no
apparent
likelihood
of
breach
which
haply
by
much
company
might
be
urg
therefore
i
say
with
noble
buckingham
that
it
is
meet
so
few
should
fetch
the
prince
hastings
and
so
say
gloster
then
be
it
so
and
go
we
to
determine
who
they
shall
be
that
straight
shall
post
to
ludlow
madam
and
you
my
mother
will
you
go
to
give
your
censures
in
this
business
exeunt
all
but
buckingham
and
gloster
buckingham
my
lord
whoever
journeys
to
the
prince
for
god
sake
let
not
us
two
stay
at

for
by
the

i
sort

as
index
to
the
story
we
late
talk
of
to

the
queen
proud
kindred
from
the
prince
gloster
my
other
self
my
counsel
consistory
my

i
as

will
go
by
thy

exeunt
scene
iii
london
a
street
enter
two
citizens
meeting
first
citizen
good
morrow
neighbour
whither
away
so
fast
second
citizen
i
promise
you
i
scarcely
know
myself
hear
you
the
news
abroad
first
citizen
yes
that
the
king
is
dead
second
citizen
ill
news
lady
seldom
comes
the
better
i
fear
i
fear
prove
a
giddy
world
enter
third
citizen
third
citizen
neighbours
god
speed
first
citizen
give
you
good
morrow
sir
third
citizen
doth
the
news
hold
of
good
king
edward
death
second
citizen
ay
sir
it
is
too
true
god
help
the
while
third
citizen
then
masters
look
to
see
a
troublous
world
first
citizen
no
no
by
god
good
grace
his
son
shall
reign
third
citizen
woe
to
that
land
that
govern
by
a
child
second
citizen
in
him
there
is
a
hope
of
government
which
in
his
nonage
council
under
him
and
in
his
full
and
ripen
years
himself
no
doubt
shall
then
and
till
then
govern
well
first
citizen
so
stood
the
state
when
henry
the
sixth
was
crown
in
paris
but
at
nine
months
old
third
citizen
stood
the
state
so
no
no
good
friends
god
wot
for
then
this
land
was
famously
with
politic
grave
counsel
then
the
king
had
virtuous
uncles
to
protect
his
grace
first
citizen
why
so
hath
this
both
by
his
father
and
mother
third
citizen
better
it
were
they
all
came
by
his
father
or
by
his
father
there
were
none
at
all
for
emulation
who
shall
now
be
nearest
will
touch
us
all
too
near
if
god
prevent
not
o
full
of
danger
is
the
duke
of
gloster
and
the
queen
sons
and
brothers
haught
and
proud
and
were
they
to
be
rul
and
not
to
rule
this
sickly
land
might
solace
as
before
first
citizen
come
come
we
fear
the
worst
all
will
be
well
third
citizen
when
clouds
are
seen
wise
men
put
on
their
cloaks
when
great
leaves
fall
then
winter
is
at
hand
when
the
sun
sets
who
doth
not
look
for
night
untimely
storms
make
men
expect
a
dearth
all
may
be
well
but
if
god
sort
it
so
more
than
we
deserve
or
i
expect
second
citizen
truly
the
hearts
of
men
are
fun
of
fear
you
can
not
reason
almost
with
a
man
that
looks
not
heavily
and
fun
of
dread
third
citizen
before
the
days
of
change
still
is
it
so
by
a
divine
instinct
men
minds
mistrust
ensuing
danger
as
by
proof
we
see
the
water
swell
before
a
boisterous
storm
but
leave
it
all
to
whither
away
second
citizen
marry
we
were
sent
for
to
the
justices

so
was
i
i

duchess
i
long
with
all
my
heart
to
see
the

i
hope

much
grown
since
last
i
saw
him
queen
elizabeth
but
i
hear
no
they
say
my
son
of
york
has
almost
him
in
his
growth
york
ay
mother
but
i
would
not

it
so
duchess
why
my

it
is
good
to
grow
york
grandam
one
night
as

ay
quoth
my
uncle
gloster
small
herbs
have
grace
great
weeds
do
grow
apace
and
since
methinks
i
would
not
grow
so
fast
because
sweet
flowers
are
slow
and
weeds
make
haste
duchess
good
faith

saying

object
the
same
to
thee
he
was
the
thing
when
he
was
young
so
long
a
growing
and
so
leisurely
that
if
his

true
he
should
be

archbishop

no
doubt
he
is
my
gracious
madam
duchess
i

how
my
young
york
i
let
me
hear
it

they
say
my

so
fast
that
he
could
gnaw
a
crust
at
two
hours
old

two
years
ere

i
want

the

seldom

never
jumpeth
with
the
heart
those
uncles
which
you
want
were
dangerous
your

attended
to
their

but
look
not

the
poison
of
their

god
keep
you
from

god
keep

i

thank
you
all
exeunt

i
thought
my
mother
and
my
brother
york
would
long
ere
this
have
met
us
on
the
way
fie
what
a
slug
is
hastings
that
he
comes
not
to
tell
us
whether
they
will
come
or
no
buckingham
and
in
good
time
here
comes
the
sweating
lord
enter
hastings
prince
welcome
my
lord
what
will
our

come
hastings
on
what
occasion
god
he
knows
not
i
the
queen
your
mother
and
your
brother
york
have
taken
sanctuary
the
tender
prince
would
fain
have
come
with
me
to
meet
your
grace
but
by
his
mother
was
perforce
withheld
buckingham
fie
what
an
indirect
and
peevish
course
is
this
of
hers
lord
cardinal
will
your
grace
persuade
the
queen
to
send
the
duke
of
york
unto
his
princely
brother
presently
if
she
deny
lord
hastings
go
with
him
and
from
her
jealous
arms
pluck
him
perforce
cardinal
my
lord
of
buckingham
if
my
weak
oratory
can
from
his
mother
win
the
duke
of
york
anon
expect
him
here
but
if
she
be
obdurate
to
mild
entreaties
god
in
heaven
forbid
we
should
infringe
the
holy
privilege
of
blessed
sanctuary
not
for
all
this
land
would
i
be
guilty
of
so
deep
a
sin
buckingham
you
are
too
my
lord
too
ceremonious
and
traditional
weigh
it
but
with
the
grossness
of
this
age
you
break
not
sanctuary
in
seizing
him
the
benefit
thereof
is
always
granted
to
those
whose
dealings
have
deserv
the
place
and
those
who
have
the
wit
to
claim
the
place
this
prince
hath
neither
claim
it
nor
deserv
it
and
therefore
in
mine
opinion
can
not
have
it
then
taking
him
from
thence
that
is
not
there
you
break
no
privilege
nor
charter
there
oft
have
i
heard
of
but
till
now
cardinal
my
lord
you
shall
my
mind
for
come
on
lord
hastings
will
you
go
with
me
hastings
i
go
my

prince
good
lords
make
all
the
speedy
haste
you
may
exeunt
cardinal
and
hastings
say
uncle
gloster
if
our
brother
come
where
shall
we
sojourn
till
our
coronation
gloster
where
it
seems
best
unto
your
royal
self
if
i
may
counsel
you
some
day
or
two
your
highness
shall
repose
you
at
the
tower
then
where
you
please
and
shall
be
thought
most
fit
for
your
best
health
and
recreation
prince
i
do
not
like
the

julius
caesar
was
a
famous
man
with
what
his
valour
did
enrich
his
wit

hath
my
lord
york
and
therefore
is
he
idle
gloster
o
my
fair
cousin
i
must
not
say
so

he
is
more
beholding
to
you
than
gloster

as
my
sovereign

you
have
power
in
me
as
in
a
kinsman

my
heart
prince

york
of
my
kind
uncle
that
i
know
will
give
and
being
but
a
toy
which
is
no
grief
to
give
gloster
a
greater
gift
than
that
i
give
my
cousin
york
a
greater
gift
o
that
the
sword
to
it
gloster
ay
gentle
cousin
were
it
light
enough

then
i
see
you

part
but
with
light
gifts
in
weightier
things
you
say
a
beggar

is
too
heavy
for

weigh
it
lightly

it
heavier
gloster

would
you
have
my
weapon

mean
to
bear
me
not
to
bear

both
you

me
because
that
i
am
little
like
an
ape
he
thinks
that
you
should
bear
me
on
your
shoulders
buckingham
with
what
a
wit
he
reasons
to
mitigate
the
scorn
he
gives
his
uncle

prettily
and
aptly
taunts
himself

cunning
and
so
young

he
commends

to
your

self
hastings
what
then
messenger
then
certifies

besides
he
says
there
are
two
councils

that

be
determin
at

one
which
may
make
you

will
presently
take

my
good
friend
catesby
where
nothing
can
proceed
that
toucheth
us
whereof
i
shall
not
have
intelligence
tell
him
his
fears
are
shallow
without
instance
and
for
his
dreams
i
wonder
he
so
simple
to
trust
the
mockery
of
unquiet
slumbers
to
fly
the
boar
before
the
boar
pursues
were
to
incense
the
boar
to
follow
us

no
chase
go
bid
thy
master
rise

guess
that
he
doth
aim
at
it
catesby
ay
on
my
life
and
hopes
to
find
you
forward
upon
his
party
for
the
gain
thereof

thereupon
he
sends
you
this
good
news
that
this
same
very
day
your
enemies

kindred
of
the
queen
must
die
at

now
the
loving

the
purpose

my

hurl
up

a
blemish
stock
whilst
in
the
mildness
of
your
sleepy
thoughts
which
here
we
waken
to
our
country
good
the
noble
isle
doth
want
her
proper
limbs
her
face
defac
with
scars
of
infamy
her
royal
stock
graft
with
ignoble
plants
and
almost
shoulder
in
the
swallowing
gulf
of
dark
forgetfulness
and
deep
oblivion
which
to
recure
we
heartily
solicit
your
gracious
self
to
take
on
you
the
charge
and
kingly
government
of
this
your
land
not
as
protector
steward
substitute
or
lowly
factor
for
another
gain
but
as
successively
from
blood
to
blood
your
right
of
birth
your
empery
your
own
for
this
consorted
with
the
citizens
your
very
worshipful
and
loving
friends
and
by
their
vehement
instigation
in
this
just
cause
come
i
to
move
your
grace
gloster
i
can
not
tell
if
to
depart
in
silence
or
bitterly
to
speak
in
your
reproof
best
fitteth
my
degree
or
your
condition
if
not
to
answer
you
might
haply
think
ambition
not
replying
yielded
to
bear
the
golden
yoke
of
sovereignty
which
fondly
you
would
here
impose
on
me
if
to
reprove
you
for
this
suit
of
yours
so
season
with
your
faithful
love
to
me
then
on
the
other
side
i
check
my
friends
therefore
to
speak
and
to
avoid
the
first
and
then
in
speaking
not
to
incur
the
last
definitively
thus
i
answer
you
your
love
deserves
my
thanks
but
my
desert
unmeritable
shuns
your
high
request
first
if
all
obstacles
were
cut
away
and
that
my
path
were
even
to
the
crown
as
the
ripe
revenue
and
due
of
birth
yet
so
much
is
my
poverty
of
spirit
so
mighty
and
so
many
my
defects
that
i
would
rather
hide
me
from
my
greatness
being
a
bark
to
brook
no
mighty
sea
than
in
my
greatness
covet
to
be
hid
and
in
the
vapour
of
my
glory
smother
but
god
be
thank
there
is
no
need
of
me
and
much
i
need
to
help
you
were
there
need
the
royal
tree
hath
left
us
royal
fruit
which
mellow
by
the
stealing
hours
of
time
will
well
become
the
seat
of
majesty
and
make
no
doubt
us
happy
by
his
reign
on
him
i
lay
that
you
would
lay
on
me
the
right
and
fortune
of
his
happy
stars
which
god
defend
that
i
should
wring
from
him
buckingham
my
lord
this
argues
conscience
in
your
grace
but
the
respects
thereof
are
nice
and
trivial
all
circumstances
well
considered
you
say
that
edward
is
your
brother
son
so
say
we
too
but
not
by
edward
wife
for
first
was
he
contract
to
lady
lucy
your
mother
lives
a
witness
to
his
vow
and
afterward
by
substitute
to
bona
sister
to
the
king
of
france
these
both
put
off
a
poor
petitioner
a
mother
to
a
many
sons
a
and
distressed
widow
even
in
the
afternoon
of
her
best
days
made
prize
and
purchase
of
his
wanton
eye
seduc
the
pitch
and
height
of
his
degree
to
base
declension
and
loath
bigamy
by
her
in
his
unlawful
bed
he
got
this
edward
whom
our
manners
call
the
prince
more
bitterly
could
i
expostulate
save
that
for
reverence
to
some
alive
i
give
a
sparing
limit
to
my
tongue
then
good
my
lord
take
to
your
royal
self
this
proffer
benefit
of
dignity
if
not
to
bless
us
and
the
land
withal
yet
to
draw
forth
your
noble
ancestry
from
the
corruption
of
abusing
time
unto
a
lineal
course
mayor
do
good
my
lord
your
citizens
entreat
you
buckingham
refuse
not
mighty

this
proffer
love
catesby

would
you
heap
those

i
do
beseech
you
take
it
not
amiss
i
can
not
nor
i
will
not
yield
to
you
buckingham
if
you
refuse
it
as
in
love
and
zeal
loath
to
depose
the
child
your
brother
son
as
well
we
know
your
tenderness
of
heart
and
gentle
kind
effeminate
remorse
which
we
have
noted
in
you
to
your
kindred
and
equally
indeed
to
all
estates
yet
know
you
accept
our
suit
or
no
your
brother
son
shall
never
reign
our
king
but
we
will
plant
some
other
in
the
throne
to
the
disgrace
and
downfall
of
your
house
and
in
this
resolution
here
we
leave
come

will
entreat
no
more
exeunt
buckingham

am
not
made

against
my
conscience
and
my
soul

her
burden
i
will
or
no
i
must
have
patience
to
endure
the
load
but
if
black
scandal
or
reproach
attend
the
sequel
of
your
imposition
your
mere
enforcement

acquittance
me
from
all
the
impure
blots
and
stains
thereof

me
henry
the
sixth
did
prophesy
that
richmond
should
be
king
when
richmond
was
a
little
peevish
boy
a
king
perhaps
buckingham
my
lord
king
richard
how
chance
the
prophet
could
not
at
that
time
have
told
me
i
being
by
that
i
should
kill
him
buckingham
my
lord
your
promise
for
the
earldom
king
richard
richmond
when
last
i
was
at
exeter
the
mayor
in
courtesy
show
me
the
castle
and
call
it
rougemount
at
which
name
i
started
because
a
bard
of
ireland
told
me
once
i
should
not
live
long
after
i
saw
richmond
buckingham
my
lord
king
richard
ay
what
buckingham
i
am
thus
bold
to
put
your
grace
in
mind
of
what
you
promis
me
king
richard
well
but
what
buckingham
upon
the
stroke
of
ten
king
richard
well
let
it
strike
buckingham
why
let
it
strike
king
richard
because
that
like
a
jack
thou
the
stroke
betwixt
thy
begging
and
my
meditation
i
am
not
in
the
giving
vein
buckingham
why
then
resolve
me
whether
you
will
or
no
king
richard
thou
troublest
me
i
am
not
in
the
vein
exeunt
king
richard
and
train
buckingham
and
is
it
thus
repays
he
my
deep
service
with
such
contempt
made
i
him
king
for
this
o
let
me
think
on
hastings
and

sad
story
o
thus
quoth
dighton
lay
the
gentle

thus
thus
quoth
forrest
girdling
one
another
within
their
alabaster
innocent
arms
their

were
four
red
roses
on
a
stalk
and
in
their
summer
beauty

a
book
of
prayers
on

to

hurl
down

only
mock
with
two
fair

a
dream
of
what
thou
wast
a
garish

to
be
the
aim
of
every
dangerous
shot
a
sign
of
dignity
a
breath
a
bubble
a
queen
in
jest
only
to
fill
the
scene
where
is
thy
husband
now
where
be
thy
brothers
where
be
thy
two

wherein
dost
thou
joy
who
sues
and
kneels
and
says
god

where

that
flatter
thee

prey

with

send
to

by
the
man
that
slew
her

a
pair
of
bleeding
hearts
thereon
engrave
edward
and
york
then
haply
will
she
weep
therefore
present
to
her
as
sometimes
margaret
did
to
thy
father
steep
in
rutland
blood
a
handkerchief
which
say
to
her
did
drain
the
purple
sap
from
her
sweet
brothers
bodies
and
bid
her
wipe
her
weeping
eyes
withal
if
this
inducement
move

of
thy
noble
deeds

anne
king
richard
you
mock
me
madam
this
is
not
the
way
to
win
your
daughter
queen
elizabeth
there
is
no
other
way
unless
thou
couldst
put
on
some
other
shape
and
not
be
richard
that
hath
done
all
this
king
richard
say
that
i
did
all
this
for
love
of
her
queen
elizabeth
nay
then
indeed
she
can
not
choose
but
hate
thee
having
bought
love
with
such
a
bloody
spoil
king
richard
look
what
is
done
can
not
be
now
amended
men
shall
deal
unadvisedly
sometimes
which
gives
leisure
to
repent
if
i
did
take
the
kingdom
from
your
sons
to
make
amends
i
give
it
to
your
daughter
if
i
have
kill
the
issue
of
your
womb
to
quicken
your
increase
i
will
beget
mine
issue
of
your
blood
upon
your
daughter
a
grandam
name
is
little
less
in
love
than
is
the
doating
title
of
a
mother
they
are
as
children
but
one
step
below
even
of
your
mettle
of
your
very
blood
of
all
one
pain
save
for
a
night
of
groans
endur
of
her
for
whom
you
bid
like
sorrow
your
children
were
vexation
to
your
youth
but
mine
shall
be
a
comfort
to
your
age
the
loss
you
have
is
but
a
son
being
king
and
by
that
loss
your
daughter
is
made
queen
i
can
not
make
you
what
amends
i
would
therefore
accept
such
kindness
as
i
can
dorset
your
son
that
with
a
fearful
soul
leads
discontented
steps
in
foreign
soil
this
fair
alliance
quickly
shall
call
home
to
high
promotions
and
great
dignity
the
king
that
calls
your
beauteous
daughter
wife
familiarly
shall
call
thy
dorset
brother
again
shall
you
be
mother
to
a
king
and
all
the
ruins
of
distressful
times
repair
with
double
riches
of
content
what
we
have
many
goodly
days
to
see
the
liquid
drops
of
tears
that
you
have
shed
shall
come
again

to
thy

bold
her
bashful
years
with
your
experience

tender
heart
the
aspiring
flame
of
golden
sovereignty
acquaint
the

with
the
sweet
silent
hours
of
marriage
joys
and
when
this
arm
of
mine
hath
chastised
the

richmond
the
sweetest
sleep
and
dreams
that
ever
enter
in
a
drowsy
head
have
i
since
your
departure
had
my
lords
methought
their
souls
whose
bodies
richard
came
to
my
tent
and
cried
on
victory
i
promise
you
my
heart
is
very
jocund
in
the
remembrance
of
so
fair
a
dream
how
far
into
the
morning
is
it
lords
lords
upon
the
stroke
of
four
richmond
why
then
is
time
to
arm
and
give
he
advances
to
the
troops
more
than
i
have
said
loving
countrymen
the
leisure
and
enforcement
of
the
time
forbids
to
dwell
on
yet
remember
this
god
and
our
good
cause
fight
upon
our
side
the
prayers
of
holy
saints
and
wronged
souls
like
bulwarks
stand
before
our
faces
richard
except
those
whom
we
fight
against
had
rather
have
us
win
than
him
they
follow
for
what
is
he
they
follow
truly
gentlemen
a
bloody
tyrant
and
a
homicide
one
rais
in
blood
and
one
in
blood
establish
one
that
made
means
to
come
by
what
he
hath
and
slaughter
those
that
were
the
means
to
help
him
a
base
foul
stone
made
precious
by
the
foil
of
england
chair
where
he
is
falsely
set

that
hath
ever
been

then
if
you
fight
against
god
enemy
god
will
in
justice
ward
you
as
his
soldiers
if
you
do
sweat
to
put
a
tyrant
down
you
sleep
in
peace
the
tyrant
being
slain
if
you
do
fight
against
your
country
foes
your
country
fat
shall
pay
your
pains
the
hire
if
you
do
fight
in
safeguard
of
your
wives
your
wives
shall
welcome
home
the
conquerors
if
you
do
free
your
children
