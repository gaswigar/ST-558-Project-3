the
historian
of
these
times
ought
to
put
no
faith
in
the
bulletins
despatches
notes
and
proclamations
which
have
emanated
from
bonaparte
or
passed
through
his
hands
for
my
part
i
believe
that
the
proverb
as
great
a
liar
as
a
bulletin
has
as
much
truth
in
it
as
the
axiom
two
and
two
make
four
the
bulletins
always
announced
what
bonaparte
wished
to
be
believed
true
but
to
form
a
proper
judgment
on
any
fact
must
be
sought
for
and
consulted
it
is
well
known
too
that
bonaparte
attached
great
importance
to
the
place
whence
he
dated
his
bulletins
thus
he
dated
his
decrees
respecting
the
theatres
and
hamburg
beef
at
moscow
the
official
documents
were
almost
always
incorrect
there
was
falsity
in
the
exaggerated
descriptions
of
his
victories
and
falsity
again
in
the
suppression
or
palliation
of
his
reverses
and
losses
a
writer
if
he
took
his
materials
from
the
bulletins
and
the
official
correspondence
of
the
time
would
compose
a
romance
rather
than
a
true
history
of
this
many
proofs
have
been
given
in
the
present
work
another
thing
which
always
appeared
to
me
very
remarkable
was
that
bonaparte
notwithstanding
his
incontestable
superiority
studied
to
depreciate
the
reputations
of
his
military
commanders
and
to
throw
on
their
shoulders
faults
which
he
had
committed
himself
it
is
notorious
that
complaints
and
remonstrances
as
energetic
as
they
were
well
founded
were
frequently
addressed
to
general
bonaparte
on
the
subject
of
his
unjust
and
partial
bulletins
which
often
attributed
the
success
of
a
day
to
some
one
who
had
very
little
to
do
with
it
and
made
no
mention
of
the
officer
who
actually
had
the
command
the
complaints
made
by
the
officers
and
soldiers
stationed
at
damietta
compelled
general
lanusse
the
commander
to
remonstrate
against
the
alteration
of
a
bulletin
by
which
an
engagement
with
a
body
of
arabs
was
represented
as
an
insignificant
affair
and
the
loss
trifling
though
the
general
had
stated
the
action
to
be
one
of
importance
and
the
loss
considerable
the
misstatement
in
consequence
of
his
spirited
and
energetic
remonstrances
was
corrected
bonaparte
took
malta
as
is
well
known
in
hours
the
empire
of
the
mediterranean
secured
to
the
english
by
the
battle
of
aboukir
and
their
numerous
cruising
vessels
gave
them
the
means
of
starving
the
garrison
and
of
thus
forcing
general
vaubois
the
commandant
of
malta
who
was
cut
off
from
all
communication
with
france
to
capitulate
accordingly
on
the
of
september
he
yielded
up
the
gibraltar
of
the
mediterranean
after
a
noble
defence
of
two
years
these
facts
require
to
be
stated
in
order
the
better
to
understand
what
follows
on
february
a
person
of
the
name
of
doublet
who
was
the
commissary
of
the
french
government
at
malta
when
we
possessed
that
island
called
upon
me
at
the
tuileries
he
complained
bitterly
that
the
letter
which
he
had
written
from
malta
to
the
first
consul
on
the
ventose
year
viii
february
had
been
altered
in
the
i
congratulated
him
said
doublet
on
the
brumaire
and
informed
him
of
the
state
of
malta
which
was
very
alarming
quite
the
contrary
was
printed
in
the
and
that
is
what
i
complain
of
it
placed
me
in
a
very
disagreeable
situation
at
malta
where
i
was
accused
of
having
concealed
the
real
situation
of
the
island
in
which
i
was
discharging
a
public
function
that
gave
weight
to
my
words
i
observed
to
him
that
as
i
was
not
the
editor
of
the
it
was
of
no
use
to
apply
to
me
but
i
told
him
to
give
me
a
copy
of
the
letter
and
i
would
mention
the
subject
to
the
first
consul
and
communicate
the
answer
to
him
doublet
searched
his
pocket
for
the
letter
but
could
not
find
it
he
said
he
would
send
a
copy
and
begged
me
to
discover
how
the
error
originated
on
the
same
day
he
sent
me
the
copy
of
the
letter
in
which
after
congratulating
bonaparte
on
his
return
the
following
passage
occurs
hasten
to
save
malta
with
men
and
provisions
no
time
is
to
be
lost
for
this
passage
these
words
were
substituted
in
the
his
name
inspires
the
brave
defenders
of
malta
with
fresh
courage
we
have
men
and
provisions
ignorant
of
the
motives
of
so
strange
a
perversion
i
showed
this
letter
to
the
first
consul
he
shrugged
up
his
shoulders
and
said
laughing
take
no
notice
of
him
he
is
a
fool
give
yourself
no
further
trouble
about
it
it
was
clear
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
done
it
was
however
in
despite
of
me
that
doublet
was
played
this
ill
turn
i
represented
to
the
first
consul
the
inconveniences
which
doublet
might
experience
from
this
affair
but
i
very
rarely
saw
letters
or
reports
published
as
they
were
received
i
can
easily
understand
how
particular
motives
might
be
alleged
in
order
to
justify
such
falsifications
for
when
the
path
of
candour
and
good
faith
is
departed
from
any
pretest
is
put
forward
to
excuse
bad
conduct
what
sort
of
a
history
would
he
write
who
should
consult
only
the
pages
of
the
after
the
vote
for
adding
a
second
ten
years
to
the
duration
of
bonaparte
consulship
he
created
on
the
of
may
the
order
of
the
legion
of
honour
this
institution
was
soon
followed
by
that
of
the
new
nobility
thus
in
a
short
space
of
time
the
concordat
to
tranquillize
consciences
and
harmony
in
the
church
the
decree
to
recall
the
emigrants
the
continuance
of
the
consular
power
for
ten
years
by
way
of
preparation
for
the
consulship
for
life
and
the
possession
of
the
empire
and
the
creation
in
a
country
which
had
abolished
all
distinctions
of
an
order
which
was
to
engender
prodigies
followed
closely
on
the
heels
of
each
other
the
bourbons
in
reviving
the
abolished
orders
were
wise
enough
to
preserve
along
with
them
the
legion
of
honour
it
has
already
been
seen
how
in
certain
circumstances
the
first
consul
always
escaped
from
the
consequences
of
his
own
precipitation
and
got
rid
of
his
blunders
by
throwing
the
blame
on
others
as
for
example
in
the
affair
of
the
parallel
between
caesar
cromwell
and
bonaparte
he
was
indeed
so
precipitate
that
one
might
say
had
he
been
a
gardener
he
would
have
wished
to
see
the
fruits
ripen
before
the
blossoms
had
fallen
off
this
inconsiderate
haste
nearly
proved
fatal
to
the
creation
of
the
legion
of
honour
a
project
which
ripened
in
his
mind
as
soon
as
he
beheld
the
orders
glittering
at
the
of
the
foreign
ministers
he
would
frequently
exclaim
this
is
well
these
are
the
things
for
the
people
i
was
i
must
confess
a
decided
partisan
of
the
foundation
in
france
of
a
new
chivalric
order
because
i
think
in
every
state
the
chief
of
the
government
ought
to
do
all
in
his
power
to
stimulate
the
honour
of
the
citizens
and
to
render
them
more
sensible
to
honorary
distinctions
than
to
pecuniary
advantages
i
tried
however
at
the
same
time
to
warn
the
first
consul
of
his
precipitancy
he
heard
me
not
but
i
must
with
equal
frankness
confess
that
on
this
occasion
i
was
soon
freed
from
all
apprehension
with
respect
to
the
consequences
of
the
difficulties
he
had
to
encounter
in
the
council
and
in
the
other
constituted
orders
of
the
state
on
the
of
may
lie
brought
forward
for
the
first
time
officially
in
the
council
of
state
the
question
of
the
establishment
of
the
legion
of
honour
which
on
the
may
was
proclaimed
a
law
of
the
state
the
opposition
to
this
measure
was
very
great
and
all
the
power
of
the
first
consul
the
force
of
his
arguments
and
the
immense
influence
of
his
position
could
procure
him
no
more
than
votes
out
of
the
same
feeling
was
displayed
at
the
tribunate
where
the
measure
only
passed
by
a
vote
of
to
the
balance
was
about
the
same
in
the
legislative
body
where
the
votes
were
to
it
follows
then
that
out
of
the
voters
in
those
three
separate
bodies
a
majority
only
of
was
obtained
surprised
at
so
feeble
a
majority
the
first
consul
said
in
the
evening
ah
i
see
very
clearly
the
prejudices
are
still
too
strong
you
were
right
i
should
have
waited
it
was
not
a
thing
of
such
urgency
but
then
it
must
be
owned
the
speakers
for
the
measure
defended
it
badly
the
strong
minority
has
not
judged
me
fairly
be
calm
rejoined
i
without
doubt
it
would
have
been
better
to
wait
but
the
thing
is
done
and
you
will
soon
find
that
the
taste
for
these
distinctions
is
not
near
gone
by
it
is
a
taste
which
belongs
to
the
nature
of
man
you
may
expect
some
extraordinary
circumstances
from
this
creation
you
will
soon
see
them
in
april
the
first
consul
left
no
stone
unturned
to
get
himself
declared
consul
for
life
it
is
perhaps
at
this
epoch
of
his
career
that
he
most
brought
into
play
those
principles
of
duplicity
and
dissimulation
which
are
commonly
called
machiavellian
never
were
trickery
falsehood
cunning
and
affected
moderation
put
into
play
with
more
talent
or
success
in
the
month
of
march
hereditary
succession
and
a
dynasty
were
in
everybody
mouths
lucien
was
the
most
violent
propagator
of
these
ideas
and
he
pursued
his
vocation
of
apostle
with
constancy
and
address
it
has
already
been
mentioned
that
by
his
brother
confession
he
published
in
a
pamphlet
enforcing
the
same
ideas
which
work
bonaparte
afterwards
condemned
as
a
premature
development
of
his
projects
de
talleyrand
whose
ideas
could
not
be
otherwise
than
favourable
to
the
monarchical
form
of
government
was
ready
to
enter
into
explanations
with
the
cabinets
of
europe
on
the
subject
the
words
which
now
constantly
resounded
in
every
ear
were
stability
and
order
under
cloak
of
which
the
downfall
of
the
people
right
was
to
be
concealed
at
the
same
time
bonaparte
with
the
view
of
disparaging
the
real
friends
of
constitutional
liberty
always
called
them
ideologues
i
have
classed
all
these
people
under
the
denomination
of
ideologues
which
besides
is
what
specially
and
literally
fits
them
searchers
after
ideas
ideas
generally
empty
they
have
been
made
more
ridiculous
than
even
i
expected
by
this
application
a
correct
one
of
the
term
ideologue
to
them
the
phrase
has
been
successful
i
believe
because
it
was
mine
napoleon
in
lucien
tome
ii
p
napoleon
welcomed
every
attack
on
this
description
of
sage
much
pleased
with
a
discourse
by
royer
collard
he
said
to
talleyrand
do
you
know
monsieur
is
grand
electeur
that
a
new
and
serious
philosophy
is
rising
in
my
university
which
may
do
us
great
honour
and
disembarrass
us
completely
of
the
ideologues
slaying
them
on
the
spot
by
reasoning
it
is
with
something
of
the
same
satisfaction
that
renan
writing
of
says
that
the
finer
dreams
had
been
disastrous
when
brought
into
the
domain
of
facts
and
that
human
concerns
only
began
to
improve
when
the
ideologues
ceased
to
meddle
with
them
souvenirs
p
or
terrorists
madame
bonaparte
opposed
with
fortitude
the
influence
of
counsels
which
she
believed
fatal
to
her
husband
he
indeed
spoke
rarely
and
seldom
confidentially
with
her
on
politics
or
public
affairs
mind
your
distaff
or
your
needle
was
with
him
a
common
phrase
the
individuals
who
applied
themselves
with
most
perseverance
in
support
of
the
hereditary
question
were
lucien
roederer
regnault
de
jean
and
fontanel
their
efforts
were
aided
by
the
conclusion
of
peace
with
england
which
by
general
tranquillity
for
a
time
afforded
the
first
consul
an
opportunity
of
forwarding
any
plan
while
the
first
consul
aspired
to
the
throne
of
france
his
brothers
especially
lucien
affected
a
ridiculous
pride
and
pretension
take
an
almost
incredible
example
of
which
i
was
witness
on
sunday
the
of
may
lucien
came
to
see
madame
bonaparte
who
said
to
him
why
did
you
not
come
to
dinner
last
monday
because
there
was
no
place
marked
for
me
the
brothers
of
napoleon
ought
to
have
the
first
place
after
him
what
am
i
to
understand
by
that
answered
madame
bonaparte
if
you
are
the
brother
of
bonaparte
recollect
what
you
were
at
my
house
all
places
are
the
same
eugene
world
never
have
committed
such
a
folly
on
such
points
there
was
constant
trouble
with
the
bonapartist
family
as
will
be
seen
in
madame
de
remusat
memoirs
for
an
instance
in
where
joseph
insisted
on
his
mother
taking
precedence
of
josephine
at
a
dinner
in
his
house
when
napoleon
settled
the
matter
by
seizing
josephine
arm
and
leading
her
in
first
to
the
consternation
of
the
party
but
napoleon
right
in
this
case
had
his
own
ideas
on
such
points
the
place
of
the
princess
elisa
the
eldest
of
his
sisters
had
been
put
below
that
of
caroline
queen
of
naples
elisa
was
then
only
princess
of
lucca
the
emperor
suddenly
rose
and
by
a
shift
to
the
right
placed
the
princess
elisa
above
the
queen
said
he
not
forget
that
in
the
imperial
family
i
am
the
only
king
lucien
tome
ii
this
rule
he
seems
to
have
adhered
to
for
when
he
and
his
brothers
went
in
the
same
carriage
to
the
champ
de
mai
in
jerome
titular
king
of
westphalia
had
to
take
the
front
seat
while
his
elder
brother
lucien
only
bearing
the
roman
title
of
prince
de
canino
sat
on
one
of
the
seats
of
honour
alongside
napoleon
jerome
was
disgusted
and
grumbled
at
a
king
having
to
give
way
to
a
mere
roman
prince
see
iung
lucien
tome
ii
p
at
this
period
when
the
consulate
for
life
was
only
in
embryo
flattering
counsels
poured
in
from
all
quarters
and
tended
to
encourage
the
first
consul
in
his
design
of
grasping
at
absolute
power
liberty
rejected
an
unlimited
power
and
set
bounds
to
the
means
he
wished
and
had
to
employ
in
order
to
gratify
his
excessive
love
of
war
and
conquest
the
present
state
of
things
this
consulate
of
ten
years
said
he
to
me
does
not
satisfy
me
i
consider
it
calculated
to
excite
unceasing
troubles
on
the
of
july
he
observed
the
question
whether
france
will
be
a
republic
is
still
doubtful
it
will
be
decided
in
five
or
six
years
it
was
clear
that
he
thought
this
too
long
a
term
whether
he
regarded
france
as
his
property
or
considered
himself
as
the
people
delegate
and
the
defender
of
their
rights
i
am
convinced
the
first
consul
wished
the
welfare
of
france
but
then
that
welfare
was
in
his
mind
inseparable
from
absolute
power
it
was
with
pain
i
saw
him
following
this
course
the
friends
of
liberty
those
who
sincerely
wished
to
maintain
a
government
constitutionally
free
allowed
themselves
to
be
prevailed
upon
to
consent
to
an
extension
of
ten
years
of
power
beyond
the
ten
years
originally
granted
by
the
constitution
they
made
this
sacrifice
to
glory
and
to
that
power
which
was
its
consequence
and
they
were
far
from
thinking
they
were
lending
their
support
to
shameless
intrigues
they
were
firm
but
for
the
moment
only
and
the
nomination
for
life
was
rejected
by
the
senate
who
voted
only
ten
years
more
power
to
bonaparte
who
saw
the
vision
of
his
ambition
again
adjourned
the
first
consul
dissembled
his
displeasure
with
that
profound
art
which
when
he
could
not
do
otherwise
he
exercised
to
an
extreme
degree
to
a
message
of
the
senate
on
the
subject
of
that
nomination
he
returned
a
calm
but
evasive
and
equivocating
answer
in
which
nourishing
his
favourite
hope
of
obtaining
more
from
the
people
than
from
the
senate
he
declared
with
hypocritical
humility
that
he
would
submit
to
this
new
sacrifice
if
the
wish
of
the
people
demanded
what
the
senate
authorised
such
was
the
homage
he
paid
to
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
which
was
soon
to
be
trampled
under
his
feet
an
extraordinary
convocation
of
the
council
of
state
took
place
on
monday
the
of
may
a
communication
was
made
to
them
not
merely
of
the
senate
consultation
but
also
of
the
first
consul
adroit
and
insidious
reply
the
council
regarded
the
first
merely
as
a
notification
and
proceeded
to
consider
on
what
question
the
people
should
be
consulted
not
satisfied
with
granting
to
the
first
consul
ten
years
of
prerogative
the
council
thought
it
best
to
strike
the
iron
while
it
was
hot
and
not
to
stop
short
in
the
middle
of
so
pleasing
a
work
in
fine
they
decided
that
the
following
question
should
be
put
to
the
people
shall
the
first
consul
be
appointed
for
life
and
shall
he
have
the
power
of
nominating
his
successor
the
reports
of
the
police
had
besides
much
influence
on
the
result
of
this
discussion
for
they
one
and
all
declared
that
the
whole
of
paris
demanded
a
consul
for
life
with
the
right
of
naming
a
successor
the
decisions
on
these
two
questions
were
carried
as
it
were
by
storm
the
appointment
for
life
passed
unanimously
and
the
right
of
naming
the
successor
by
a
majority
the
first
consul
however
formally
declared
that
he
condemned
this
second
measure
which
had
not
originated
with
himself
on
receiving
the
decision
of
the
council
of
state
the
first
consul
to
mask
his
plan
for
attaining
absolute
power
thought
it
advisable
to
appear
to
reject
a
part
of
what
was
offered
him
he
therefore
cancelled
that
clause
which
proposed
to
give
him
the
power
of
appointing
a
successor
and
which
had
been
carried
by
a
small

before
i

farther
i
must
go
back
for
a

moments
as
i
have
already
frequently
done
in
order
to
introduce
some
circumstances
which
escaped
my
recollection
or
which
i
purposely
reserved
that
i
might
place
them
amongst
facts
analogous
to
them
thus
for
instance
i
have
only
referred
in
passing
to
a
man
who
since
become
a
monarch
has
not
ceased
to
honour
me
with
his
friendship
as
will
be
seen
in
the
course
of
my
memoirs
since
the
part
we
have
seen
him
play
in
the
events
of
the
brumaire
this
man
whom
the
inexplicable
combination
of
events
has
raised
to
a
throne
for
the
happiness
of
the
people
he
is
called
to
govern
is
bernadotte
it
was
evident
that
bernadotte
must
necessarily
fall
into
a
kind
of
disgrace
for
not
having
supported
bonaparte
projects
at
the
period
of
the
overthrow
of
the
directory
the
first
consul
however
did
not
dare
to
avenge
himself
openly
but
he
watched
for
every
opportunity
to
remove
bernadotte
from
his
presence
to
place
him
in
difficult
situations
and
to
entrust
him
with
missions
for
which
no
precise
instructions
were
given
in
the
hope
that
bernadotte
would
commit
faults
for
which
the
first
consul
might
make
him
wholly
responsible
at
the
commencement
of
the
consulate
the
deplorable
war
in
la
vendee
raged
in
all
its
intensity
the
organization
of
the
chouans
was
complete
and
this
civil
war
caused
bonaparte
much
more
uneasiness
than
that
which
he
was
obliged
to
conduct
on
the
rhine
and
in
italy
because
from
the
success
of
the
vendeans
might
arise
a
question
respecting
internal
government
the
solution
of
which
was
likely
to
be
contrary
to
bonaparte
views
the
slightest
success
of
the
vendeans
spread
alarm
amongst
the
holders
of
national
property
and
besides
there
was
no
hope
of
reconciliation
between
france
and
england
her
eternal
and
implacable
enemy
as
long
as
the
flame
of
insurrection
remained
unextinguished
the
task
of
terminating
this
unhappy
struggle
was
obviously
a
difficult
one
bonaparte
therefore
resolved
to
impose
it
on
bernadotte
but
this
general
conciliatory
disposition
his
chivalrous
manners
his
tendency
to
indulgence
and
a
happy
mixture
of
prudence
and
firmness
made
him
succeed
where
others
would
have
failed
he
finally
established
good
order
and
submission
to
the
laws
some
time
after
the
pacification
of
la
vendee
a
rebellious
disposition
manifested
itself
at
tours
amongst
the
soldiers
of
a
regiment
stationed
there
the
men
refused
to
march
until
they
received
their
arrears
of
pay
bernadotte
as
of
the
army
of
the
west
without
being
alarmed
at
the
disturbance
ordered
the
the
one
in
question
to
be
drawn
up
in
the
square
of
tours
where
at
the
very
head
of
the
corps
the
leaders
of
the
mutiny
were
by
his
orders
arrested
without
any
resistance
being
offered
carnot
who
was
then
minister
of
war
made
a
report
to
the
first
consul
on
this
affair
which
but
for
the
firmness
of
bernadotte
might
have
been
attended
with
disagreeable
results
carnet
report
contained
a
plain
statement
of
the
facts
and
of
general
bernadotte
conduct
bonaparte
was
however
desirous
to
find
in
it
some
pretext
for
blaming
him
and
made
me
write
these
words
on
the
margin
of
the
report
general
bernadotte
did
not
act
discreetly
in
adopting
such
severe
measures
against
the
he
not
having
the
means
if
he
head
been
unsuccessful
of
order
in
a
town
the
garrison
of
which
was
not
strong
enough
to
subdue
the
mutineers
a
few
days
after
the
first
consul
having
learned
that
the
result
of
this
affair
was
quite
different
from
that
which
he
affected
to
dread
and
being
convinced
that
by
bernadotte
firmness
alone
order
had
been
restored
he
found
himself
in
some
measure
constrained
to
write
to
the
general
and
he
dictated
the
following
letter
to
me
paris
vendemiaire
year
xi
i
have
read
with
interest
the
account
of
what
you
did
to
order
in
the
and
also
the
report
of
general
liebert
dated
the
vendemiaire
tell
that
officer
that
the
government
is
satisfied
with
his
conduct
his
promotion
from
the
rank
of
colonel
to
that
of
general
of
brigade
is
confirmed
i
wish
that
brave
officer
to
come
to
paris
he
has
afforded
an
example
of
firmness
and
energy
which
does
honour
to
a
soldier
signed
bonaparte
thus
in
the
same
affair
bonaparte
in
a
few
days
from
the
spontaneous
expression
of
blame
dictated
by
hate
was
reduced
to
the
necessity
of
declaring
his
approbation
which
he
did
as
may
be
seen
with
studied
coldness
and
even
taking
pains
to
make
his
praises
apply
to
colonel
liebert
and
not
to
the
time
only
served
to
augment
bonaparte
dislike
of
bernadotte
it
might
be
said
that
the
farther
he
advanced
in
his
rapid
march
towards
absolute
power
the
more
animosity
he
cherished
against
the
individual
who
had
refused
to
aid
his
first
steps
in
his
adventurous
career
at
the
same
time
the
persons
about
bonaparte
who
practised
the
art
of
flattering
failed
not
to
multiply
reports
and
insinuations
against
bernadotte
i
recollect
one
day
when
there
was
to
be
a
grand
public
levee
seeing
bonaparte
so
much
out
of
temper
that
i
asked
him
the
cause
of
it
i
can
bear
it
no
longer
he
replied
impetuously
i
have
resolved
to
have
a
scene
with
bernadotte
he
will
probably
be
here
i
will
open
the
fire
let
what
will
come
of
it
he
may
do
what
he
pleases
we
shall
see
it
is
time
there
should
be
an
end
of
this
i
had
never
before
observed
the
first
consul
so
violently
irritated
he
was
in
a
terrible
passion
and
i
dreaded
the
moment
when
the
levee
was
to
open
when
he
left
me
to
go
down
to
the
salon
i
availed
myself
of
the
opportunity
to
get
there
before
him
which
i
could
easily
do
as
the
salon
was
not
twenty
steps
from
the
cabinet
by
good
luck
bernadotte
was
the
first
person
i
saw
he
was
standing
in
the
recess
of
a
window
which
looked
on
the
square
of
the
carrousel
to
cross
the
salon
and
reach
the
general
was
the
work
of
a
moment
general
said
i
trust
me
and
retire
i
have
good
reasons
for
advising
it
bernadotte
seeing
my
extreme
anxiety
and
aware
of
the
sincere
sentiments
of
esteem
end
friendship
which
i
entertained
for
him
consented
to
retire
and
i
regarded
this
as
a
triumph
for
knowing
bernadotte
frankness
of
character
and
his
nice
sense
of
honour
i
was
quite
certain
that
he
would
not
submit
to
the
harsh
observations
which
bonaparte
intended
to
address
to
him
my
stratagem
had
all
the
success
i
could
desire
the
first
consul
suspected
nothing
and
remarked
only
one
thing
which
was
that
his
victim
was
absent
when
the
levee
was
over
he
said
to
me
what
do
you
think
of
it
bourrienne
did
not
come
so
much
the
better
for
him
general
was
my
reply
nothing
further
happened
the
first
consul
on
returning
from
josephine
found
me
in
the
cabinet
and
consequently
could
suspect
nothing
and
my
communication
with
bernadotte
did
not
occupy
five
minutes
bernadotte
always
expressed
himself
much
gratified
with
the
proof
of
friendship
i
gave
him
at
this
delicate
conjuncture
the
fact
is
that
from
a
disposition
of
my
mind
which
i
could
not
myself
account
for
the
more
unjust
hatred
of
bernadotte
increased
the
more
sympathy
and
admiration
i
felt
for
the
noble
character
of
the
latter
the
event
in
question
occurred
in
the
spring
of
it
was
at
this
period
that
bonaparte
first
occupied
st
cloud
which
he
was
much
pleased
with
because
he
found
himself
more
at
liberty
there
than
at
the
tuileries
which
palace
is
really
only
a
prison
for
royalty
as
there
a
sovereign
can
not
even
take
the
air
at
a
window
without
immediately
being
the
object
of
the
curiosity
of
the
public
who
collect
in
large
crowds
at
st
cloud
on
the
contrary
bonaparte
could
walk
out
from
his
cabinet
and
prolong
his
promenade
without
being
annoyed
by
petitioners
one
of
his
first
steps
was
to
repair
the
cross
road
leading
from
st
cloud
to
malmaison
between
which
places
bonaparte
rode
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
this
proximity
to
the
country
which
he
liked
made
staying
at
st
cloud
yet
pleasanter
to
him
it
was
at
st
cloud
that
the
first
consul
made
if
i
may
so
express
it
his
first
rehearsals
of
the
grand
drama
of
the
empire
it
was
there
he
began
to
introduce
in
external
forms
the
habits
and
etiquette
which
brought
to
mind
the
ceremonies
of
sovereignty
he
soon
perceived
the
influence
which
pomp
of
ceremony
brilliancy
of
appearance
and
richness
of
costume
exercise
over
the
mass
of
mankind
men
he
remarked
to
me
a
this
period
well
deserve
the
contempt
i
feel
for
them
i
have
only
to
put
some
gold
lace
on
the
coats
of
my
virtuous
republicans
and
they
immediately
become
just
what
i
wish
them
i
remember
one
day
after
one
of
his
frequent
sallies
of
contempt
for
human
kind
i
observed
to
him
that
although
baubles
might
excite
vulgar
admiration
there
were
some
distinguished
men
who
did
not
permit
themselves
to
be
fascinated
by
their
allurements
and
i
mentioned
the
celebrated
fox
by
way
of
example
who
previous
to
the
conclusion
of
the
peace
of
amiens
visited
paris
where
he
was
remarked
for
his
extreme
simplicity
the
first
consul
said
ah
you
are
right
with
respect
to
him
fox
is
a
truly
great
man
and
pleases
me
much
in
fact
bonaparte
always
received
fox
visits
with
the
greatest
satisfaction
and
after
every
conversation
they
had
together
he
never
failed
to
express
to
me
the
pleasure
which
he
experienced
in
discoursing
with
a
man
every
way
worthy
of
the
great
celebrity
he
had
attained
he
considered
him
a
very
superior
man
and
wished
he
might
have
to
treat
with
him
in
his
future
negotiations
with
england
it
may
be
supposed
that
fox
on
his
part
never
forgot
the
terms
of
intimacy
i
may
say
of
confidence
on
which
he
had
been
with
the
first
consul
in
fact
he
on
several
occasions
informed
him
in
time
of
war
of
the
plots
formed
against
his
life
less
could
not
be
expected
from
a
man
of
so
noble
a
character
i
can
likewise
affirm
having
more
than
once
been
in
possession
of
proofs
of
the
fact
that
the
english
government
constantly
rejected
with
indignation
all
such
projects
i
do
not
mean
those
which
had
for
their
object
the
overthrow
of
the
consular
or
imperial
government
but
all
plans
of
assassination
and
secret
attacks
on
the
person
of
bonaparte
whether
first
consul
or
emperor
i
will
here
request
the
indulgence
of
the
reader
whilst
i
relate
a
circumstance
which
occurred
a
year
before
fox
journey
to
paris
but
as
it
refers
to
moreau
i
believe
that
the
transposition
will
be
pardoned
more
easily
than
the
omission
during
the
summer
the
first
consul
took
a
fancy
to
give
a
grand
military
dinner
at
a
restaurateur
the
restaurateur
he
favoured
with
his
company
was
veri
whose
establishment
was
situated
on
the
terrace
of
the
feuillans
with
an
entrance
into
the
garden
of
the
tuileries
bonaparte
did
not
send
an
invitation
to
moreau
whom
i
met
by
chance
that
day
in
the
following
manner
the
ceremony
of
the
dinner
at
leaving
me
at
liberty
to
dispose
of
my
time
i
availed
myself
of
it
to
go
and
dine
at
a
restaurateur
named
rose
who
then
enjoyed
great
celebrity
amongst
the
distinguished
gastronomes
i
dined
in
company
with
carbonnet
a
friend
of
moreau
family
and
two
or
three
other
persons
whilst
we
were
at
table
in
the
rotunda
we
were
informed
by
the
waiter
who
attended
on
us
that
general
moreau
and
his
wife
with
lacuee
and
two
other
military
men
were
in
an
adjoining
apartment
suchet
who
had
dined
at
veri
where
he
said
everything
was
prodigiously
dull
on
rising
from
the
table
joined
moreau
party
these
details
we
learned
from
carbonnet
who
left
us
for
a
few
moments
to
see
the
general
and
madame
moreau
bonaparte
affectation
in
not
inviting
moreau
at
the
moment
when
the
latter
had
returned
a
conqueror
from
the
army
of
the
rhine
and
at
the
same
time
the
affectation
of
moreau
in
going
publicly
the
same
day
to
dine
at
another
restaurateur
afforded
ground
for
the
supposition
that
the
coolness
which
existed
between
them
would
soon
be
converted
into
enmity
the
people
of
paris
naturally
thought
that
the
conqueror
of
marengo
might
without
any
degradation
have
given
the
conqueror
of
hohenlinden
a
seat
at
his
table
by
the
commencement
of
the
year
the
republic
had
ceased
to
be
anything
else
than
a
fiction
or
an
historical
recollection
all
that
remained
of
it
was
a
deceptive
inscription
on
the
gates
of
the
palace
even
at
the
time
of
his
installation
at
the
tuileries
bonaparte
had
caused
the
two
trees
of
liberty
which
were
planted
in
the
court
to
be
cut
down
thus
removing
the
outward
emblems
before
he
destroyed
the
reality
but
the
moment
the
senatorial
decisions
of
the
and
of
august
were
published
it
was
evident
to
the
dullest
perceptions
that
the
power
of
the
first
consul
wanted
nothing
but
a
name
after
these
bonaparte
readily
accustomed
himself
to
regard
the
principal
authorities
of
the
state
merely
as
necessary
instruments
for
the
exercise
of
his
power
interested
advisers
then
crowded
round
him
it
was
seriously
proposed
that
he
should
restore
the
ancient
titles
as
being
more
in
harmony
with
the
new
power
which
the
people
had
confided
to
him
than
the
republican
forms
he
was
still
of
opinion
however
according
to
his
phrase
that
the
pear
was
not
yet
ripe
and
would
not
hear
this
project
spoken
of
for
a
moment
all
this
he
said
to
me
one
day
will
come
in
good
time
but
you
must
see
bourrienne
that
it
is
necessary
i
should
in
the
first
place
assume
a
title
from
which
the
others
that
i
will
give
to
everybody
will
naturally
take
their
origin
the
greatest
difficulty
is
surmounted
there
is
no
longer
any
person
to
deceive
everybody
sees
as
clear
as
day
that
it
is
only
one
step
which
separates
the
throne
from
the
consulate
for
life
however
we
must
be
cautious
there
are
some
troublesome
fellows
in
the
tribunate
but
i
will
take
care
of
them
whilst
these
serious
questions
agitated
men
minds
the
greater
part
of
the
residents
at
malmaison
took
a
trip
to
plombieres
josephine
bonaparte
mother
madame
hortense
and
general
rapp
were
of
this
party
it
pleased
the
fancy
of
the
jocund
company
to
address
to
me
a
bulletin
of
the
pleasant
and
unpleasant
occurrences
of
the
journey
i
insert
this
letter
merely
as
a
proof
of
the
intimacy
which
existed
between
the
writers
and
myself
it
follows
precisely
as
i
have
preserved
it
with
the
exception
of
the
blots
for
which
it
will
be
seen
they
apologised
an
account
of
the
journey
to
plombieres
to
the
inhabitants
of
malmaison
the
whole
party
left
malmaison
in
tears
which
brought
on
such
dreadful
headaches
that
all
the
amiable
persons
were
quite
overcome
by
the
idea
of
the
journey
madame
bonaparte
mere
supported
the
fatigues
of
this
memorable
day
with
the
greatest
courage
but
madame
bonaparte
consulesse
did
not
show
any
the
two
young
ladies
who
sat
in
the
dormouse
mademoiselle
hortense
and
madame
lavallette
were
rival
candidates
for
a
bottle
of
eau
de
cologne
and
every
now
and
then
the
amiable
rapp
made
the
carriage
stop
for
the
comfort
of
his
poor
little
sick
heart
which
overflowed
with
bile
in
fine
he
was
obliged
to
take
to
bed
on
arriving
at
epernay
while
the
rest
of
the
amiable
party
tried
to
drown
their
sorrows
in
champagne
the
second
day
was
more
fortunate
on
the
score
of
health
and
spirits
but
provisions
were
wanting
and
great
were
the
sufferings
of
the
stomach
the
travellers
lived
on
the
hope
of
a
good
supper
at
toul
but
despair
was
at
its
height
when
on
arriving
there
they
found
only
a
wretched
inn
and
nothing
in
it
we
saw
some
folks
there
which
indemnified
us
a
little
for
spinach
dressed
in
and
red
asparagus
fried
with
curdled
milk
who
would
not
have
been
amused
to
see
the
malmaison
gourmands
seated
at
a
table
so
shockingly
served
in
no
record
of
history
is
there
to
be
found
a
day
passed
in
distress
so
dreadful
as
that
on
which
we
arrived
at
plombieres
on
departing
from
toul
we
intended
to
breakfast
at
nancy
for
every
stomach
had
been
empty
for
two
days
but
the
civil
and
military
authorities
came
out
to
meet
us
and
prevented
us
from
executing
our
plan
we
continued
our
route
wasting
away
so
that
you
might
see
us
growing
thinner
every
moment
to
complete
our
misfortune
the
dormouse
which
seemed
to
have
taken
a
fancy
to
embark
on
the
moselle
for
metz
barely
escaped
an
overturn
but
at
plombieres
we
have
been
well
compensated
for
this
unlucky
journey
for
on
our
arrival
we
were
received
with
all
kinds
of
rejoicings
the
town
was
illuminated
the
cannon
fired
and
the
faces
of
handsome
women
at
all
the
windows
give
us
reason
to
hope
that
we
shall
bear
our
absence
from
malmaison
with
the
less
regret
with
the
exception
of
some
anecdotes
which
we
reserve
for
on
our
return
you
have
here
a
correct
account
of
our
journey
which
we
the
undersigned
hereby
certify
josephine
bonaparte
hortense
beauharnais
rapp
bonaparte
mere
the
company
ask
pardon
for
the
blots
messidor
it
is
requested
that
the
person
who
receives
this
journal
will
show
it
to
all
who
take
an
interest
in
the
fair
travellers
this
journey
to
plombieres
was
preceded
by
a
scene
which
i
should
abstain
from
describing
if
i
had
not
undertaken
to
relate
the
truth
respecting
the
family
of
the
first
consul
two
or
three
days
before
her
departure
madame
bonaparte
sent
for
me
i
obeyed
the
summons
and
found
her
in
tears
what
a
a
man
is
that
lucien
she
exclaimed
in
accents
of
grief
if
you
knew
my
friend
the
shameful
proposals
he
has
dared
to
make
to
me
are
going
to
the
waters
said
he
must
get
a
child
by
some
other
person
since
you
can
not
have
one
by
him
imagine
the
indignation
with
which
i
received
such
advice
he
continued
you
do
not
wish
it
or
can
not
help
it
bonaparte
must
get
a
child
by
another
woman
and
you
must
adopt
it
for
it
is
necessary
to
secure
an
hereditary
successor
it
is
for
your
interest
you
must
know
that
sir
i
replied
you
imagine
the
nation
will
suffer
a
bastard
to
govern
it
lucien
lucien
you
would
ruin
your
brother
this
is
dreadful
wretched
should
i
be
were
any
one
to
suppose
me
capable
of
listening
without
horror
to
your
infamous
proposal
your
ideas
are
poisonous
your
language
horrible
madame
retorted
he
i
can
say
to
that
is
that
i
am
really
sorry
for
you
the
amiable
josephine
was
sobbing
whilst
she
described
this
scene
to
me
and
i
was
not
insensible
to
the
indignation
which
she
felt
the
truth
is
that
at
that
period
lucien
though
constantly
affecting
to
despise
power
for
himself
was
incessantly
labouring
to
concentrate
it
in
the
hands
of
his
brother
and
he
considered
three
things
necessary
to
the
success
of
his
views
namely
hereditary
succession
divorce
and
the
imperial
government
lucien
had
a
delightful
house
near
neuilly
some
days
before
the
deplorable
scene
which
i
have
related
he
invited
bonaparte
and
all
the
inmates
at
malmaison
to
witness
a
theatrical
representation
was
the
piece
performed
elise
played
alzire
and
lucien
zamore
the
warmth
of
their
declarations
the
energetic
expression
of
their
gestures
the
too
faithful
nudity
of
costume
disgusted
most
of
the
spectators
and
bonaparte
more
than
any
other
when
the
play
was
over
he
was
quite
indignant
it
is
a
scandal
he
said
to
me
in
an
angry
tone
i
ought
not
to
suffer
such
indecencies
i
will
give
lucien
to
understand
that
i
will
have
no
more
of
it
when
his
brother
had
resumed
his
own
dress
and
came
into
the
salon
he
addressed
him
publicly
and
gave
him
to
understand
that
he
must
for
the
future
desist
from
such
representations
when
we
returned
to
malmaison
he
again
spoke
of
what
had
passed
with
dissatisfaction
what
said
he
when
i
am
endeavouring
to
restore
purity
of
manners
my
brother
and
sister
must
needs
exhibit
themselves
upon
the
boards
almost
in
a
state
of
nudity
it
is
an
insult
lucien
had
a
strong
predilection
for
theatrical
exhibitions
to
which
he
attached
great
importance
the
fact
is
he
declaimed
in
a
superior
style
and
might
have
competed
with
the
best
professional
actors
it
was
said
that
the
turban
of
orosmane
the
costume
of
america
the
roman
toga
or
the
robe
of
the
high
priest
of
jerusalem
all
became
him
equally
well
and
i
believe
that
this
was
the
exact
truth
theatrical
representations
were
not
confined
to
neuilly
we
had
our
theatre
and
our
company
of
actors
at
malmaison
but
there
everything
was
conducted
with
the
greatest
decorum
and
now
that
i
have
got
behind
the
scenes
i
will
not
quit
them
until
i
have
let
the
reader
into
the
secrets
of
our
drama
by
the
direction
of
the
first
consul
a
very
pretty
little
theatre
was
built
at
malmaison
our
usual
actors
were
eugene
beauharnais
hortense
madame
murat
lauriston
didelot
one
of
the
prefects
of
the
palace
some
other
individuals
belonging
to
the
first
consul
household
and
myself
freed
from
the
cares
of
government
which
we
confined
as
much
as
possible
to
the
tuileries
we
were
a
very
happy
colony
at
malmaison
and
besides
we
were
young
and
what
is
there
to
which
youth
does
not
add
charms
the
pieces
which
the
first
consul
most
liked
to
see
us
perform
were
barbier
de
seville
and
et
malice
in
le
barbier
lauriston
played
the
part
of
count
almaviva
hortense
rosins
eugene
basil
didelot
figaro
i
bartholo
and
isabey
our
other
stock
pieces
were
projets
de
mariage
la
gageltre
the
dapit
anloureux
in
which
i
played
the
part
of
the
valet
and
de
campagne
in
which
i
enacted
the
baron
having
for
my
baroness
the
young
and
handsome
caroline
murat
hortense
acting
was
perfection
caroline
was
middling
eugene
played
very
well
lauriston
was
rather
heavy
didelot
passable
and
i
may
venture
to
assert
without
vanity
that
i
was
not
quite
the
worst
of
the
company
if
we
were
not
good
actors
it
was
not
for
want
of
good
instruction
and
good
advice
talma
and
michot
came
to
direct
us
and
made
us
rehearse
before
them
sometimes
altogether
and
sometimes
separately
how
many
lessons
have
i
received
from
michot
whilst
walking
in
the
beautiful
park
of
malmaison
and
may
i
be
excused
for
saying
that
i
now
experience
pleasure
in
looking
back
upon
these
trifles
which
are
matters
of
importance
when
one
is
young
and
which
contrasted
so
singularly
with
the
great
theatre
on
which
we
did
not
represent
fictitious
characters
we
had
to
adopt
theatrical
language
a
good
supply
of
property
bonaparte
presented
each
of
us
with
a
collection
of
dramas
very
well
bound
and
as
the
patron
of
the
company
he
provided
us
with
rich
and
elegant
dresses
while
bourrienne
belonging
to
the
malmaison
company
considered
that
the
acting
at
neuilly
was
indecent
lucien
who
refused
to
act
at
malmaison
naturally
thought
the
malmaison
troupe
was
dull
hortense
and
caroline
filled
the
principal
parts
they
were
very
commonplace
in
this
they
followed
the
unfortunate
marie
antoinette
and
her
companions
louis
not
naturally
polite
when
seeing
them
act
had
said
that
it
was
royally
badly
acted
see
madame
campan
life
of
marie
antoinette
tome
the
first
consul
said
of
his
troupe
that
it
was
sovereignly
badly
acted
murat
lannes
and
even
caroline
ranted
elisa
who
having
been
educated
at
saint
cyr
spoke
purely
and
without
accent
refused
to
act
janot
acted
well
the
drunken
parts
and
even
the
others
he
undertook
the
rest
were
decidedly
bad
worse
than
bad
ridiculous
iung
lucien
tome
ii
rival
actors
are
not
fair
critics
let
us
hear
madame
junot
tome
ii
the
cleverest
of
our
company
was
de
bourrienne
he
played
the
more
dignified
characters
in
real
perfection
and
his
talent
was
the
more
pleasing
as
it
was
not
the
result
of
study
but
of
a
perfect
comprehension
of
his
part
and
she
goes
on
to
say
that
even
the
best
professional
actors
might
have
learnt
from
him
in
some
parts
the
audience
was
not
a
pleasant
one
to
face
it
was
the
first
consul
habit
to
invite
forty
persons
to
dinner
and
a
hundred
and
fifty
for
the
evening
and
consequently
to
hear
criticise
and
banter
us
without
mercy
memoirs
of
duchesse
tome
ii
bonaparte
took
great
pleasure
in
our
performances
he
liked
to
see
plays
acted
by
persons
with
whom
he
was
familiar
sometimes
he
complimented
us
on
our
exertions
although
i
was
as
much
amused
with
the
thing
as
others
i
was
more
than
once
obliged
to
remind
him
that
my
occupations
left
me
but
little
time
to
learn
my
parts
then
he
would
assume
his
coaxing
manner
and
say
come
do
not
vex
me
you
have
such
a
memory
you
know
that
it
amuses
me
you
see
that
these
performances
render
malmaison
gay
and
animated
josephine
takes
much
pleasure
in
them
rise
earlier
in
the
in
fact
i
sleep
too
much
is
not
that
the
cafe
come
bourrienne
do
oblige
me
you
make
me
laugh
so
heartily
do
not
deprive
me
of
this
pleasure
i
have
not
over
much
amusement
as
you
well
know
all
truly
i
would
not
deprive
you
of
any
pleasure
i
am
delighted
to
be
able
to
contribute
to
your
amusement
after
a
conversation
of
this
sort
i
could
not
do
less
than
set
about
studying
my
part
at
this
period
during
summer
i
had
half
the
sunday
to
myself
i
was
however
obliged
to
devote
a
portion
of
this
precious
leisure
to
pleasing
bonaparte
by
studying
a
new
part
as
a
surprise
for
him
occasionally
however
i
passed
the
time
at
ruel
i
recollect
that
one
day
when
i
had
hurried
there
from
malmaison
i
lost
a
beautiful
watch
made
by
breguet
it
was
four
in
the
afternoon
and
the
road
was
that
day
thronged
with
people
i
made
my
loss
publicly
known
by
means
of
the
crier
of
ruel
an
hour
after
as
i
was
sitting
down
to
table
a
young
lad
belonging
to
the
village
brought
me
my
watch
he
had
found
it
on
the
high
road
in
a
wheel
rut
i
was
pleased
with
the
probity
of
this
young
man
and
rewarded
both
him
and
his
father
who
accompanied
him
i
reiterated
the
circumstance
the
same
evening
to
the
first
consul
who
was
so
struck
with
this
instance
of
honesty
that
he
directed
me
to
procure
information
respecting
the
young
man
and
his
family
i
learned
that
they
were
honest
peasants
bonaparte
gave
employment
to
three
brothers
of
this
family
and
what
was
most
difficult
to
persuade
him
to
he
exempted
the
young
man
who
brought
me
the
watch
from
the
conscription
when
a
fact
of
this
nature
reached
bonaparte
ear
it
was
seldom
that
he
did
not
give
the
principal
actor
in
it
some
proof
of
his
satisfaction
two
qualities
predominated
in
his
character
kindness
and
impatience
impatience
when
he
was
under
its
influence
got
the
better
of
him
it
was
then
impossible
for
him
to
control
himself
i
had
a
remarkable
proof
of
it
about
this
very
period
canova
having
arrived
in
paris
came
to
st
cloud
to
model
the
figure
of
the
first
consul
of
whom
he
was
about
to
make
a
colossal
statue
this
great
artist
came
often
in
the
hope
of
getting
his
model
to
stand
in
the
proper
attitude
but
bonaparte
was
so
tired
disgusted
and
fretted
by
the
process
that
he
very
seldom
put
himself
in
the
required
attitude
and
then
only
for
a
short
time
bonaparte
notwithstanding
had
the
highest
regard
for
canova
whenever
he
was
announced
the
first
consul
sent
me
to
keep
him
company
until
he
was
at
leisure
to
give
him
a
sitting
but
he
would
shrug
up
his
shoulders
and
say
more
modeling
good
heavens
how
vexatious
canova
expressed
great
displeasure
at
not
being
able
to
study
his
model
as
he
wished
to
do
and
the
little
anxiety
of
bonaparte
on
the
subject
damped
the
ardour
of
his
imagination
everybody
agrees
in
saying
that
he
has
not
succeeded
in
the
work
and
i
have
explained
the
reason
the
duke
of
wellington
afterwards
possessed
this
colossal
statue

was

that
a
prince
should
change
his
ministers
as
seldom
as
possible
and
never
except
upon
serious
grounds
bonaparte
acted
on
this
principle
when
first
consul
and
also
when
he
became
emperor
he
often
allowed
unjust
causes
to
influence
him
but
he
never
dismissed
a
minister
without
cause
indeed
he
more
than
once
without
any
reason
retained
ministers
longer
than
he
ought
to
have
done
in
the
situations
in
which
he
had
placed
them
bonaparte
tenacity
in
this
respect
in
some
instances
produced
very
opposite
results
for
instance
it
afforded
gaudin
time
to
establish
a
degree
of
order
in
the
administration
of
finance
which
before
his
time
had
never
existed
and
on
the
other
hand
it
enabled
decres
to
reduce
the
ministry
of
marine
to
an
unparalleled
state
of
confusion
bonaparte
saw
nothing
in
men
but
helps
and
obstacles
on
the
brumaire
fouche
was
a
help
the
first
consul
feared
that
he
would
become
an
obstacle
it
was
necessary
therefore
to
think
of
dismissing
him
bonaparte
most
sincere
friends
had
from
the
beginning
been
opposed
to
fouche
having
any
share
in
the
government
but
their
disinterested
advice
produced
no
other
result
than
their
own
disgrace
so
influential
a
person
had
fouche
become
how
could
it
be
otherwise
fouche
was
identified
with
the
republic
by
the
death
of
the
king
for
which
he
had
voted
with
the
reign
of
terror
by
his
sanguinary
missions
to
lyons
and
nevers
with
the
consulate
by
his
real
though
perhaps
exaggerated
services
with
bonaparte
by
the
charm
with
which
he
might
be
said
to
have
fascinated
him
with
josephine
by
the
enmity
of
the
first
brothers
who
would
believe
it
fouche
ranked
the
enemies
of
the
revolution
amongst
his
warmest
partisans
they
overwhelmed
him
with
eulogy
to
the
disparagement
even
of
the
head
of
the
state
because
the
cunning
minister
practising
an
interested
indulgence
set
himself
up
as
the
protector
of
individuals
belonging
to
classes
which
when
he
was
proconsul
he
had
attacked
in
the
mass
director
of
public
opinion
and
having
in
his
hands
the
means
at
his
pleasure
of
inspiring
fear
or
of
entangling
by
inducements
it
was
all
in
his
favour
that
he
had
already
directed
this
opinion
the
machinery
he
set
in
motion
was
so
calculated
that
the
police
was
rather
the
police
of
fouche
than
that
of
the
minister
of
the
general
police
throughout
paris
and
indeed
throughout
all
france
fouche
obtained
credit
for
extraordinary
ability
and
the
popular
opinion
was
correct
in
this
respect
namely
that
no
man
ever
displayed
such
ability
in
making
it
be
supposed
that
he
really
possessed
talent
fouche
secret
in
this
particular
is
the
whole
secret
of
the
greater
part
of
those
persons
who
are
called
statesmen
be
this
as
it
may
the
first
consul
did
not
behold
with
pleasure
the
factitious
influence
of
which
fouche
had
possessed
himself
for
some
time
past
to
the
repugnance
which
at
bottom
he
had
felt
towards
fouche
were
added
other
causes
of
discontent
in
consequence
of
having
been
deceived
by
secret
reports
and
correspondence
bonaparte
began
to
shrug
up
his
shoulders
with
an
expression
of
regret
when
he
received
them
and
said
would
you
believe
bourrienne
that
i
have
been
imposed
on
by
these
things
all
such
denunciations
are
useless
scandalous
all
the
reports
from
prefects
and
the
police
all
the
intercepted
letters
are
a
tissue
of
absurdities
and
lies
i
desire
to
have
no
more
of
them
he
said
so
but
he
still
received
them
however
dismissal
was
resolved
upon
but
though
bonaparte
wished
to
get
rid
of
him
still
under
the
influence
of
the
charm
he
dared
not
proceed
against
him
without
the
greatest
caution
he
first
resolved
upon
the
suppression
of
the
office
of
minister
of
police
in
order
to
disguise
the
motive
for
the
removal
of
the
minister
the
first
consul
told
fouche
that
this
suppression
which
he
spoke
of
as
being
yet
remote
was
calculated
more
than
anything
else
to
give
strength
to
the
government
since
it
would
afford
a
proof
of
the
security
and
internal
tranquillity
of
france
overpowered
by
the
arguments
with
which
bonaparte
supported
his
proposition
fouche
could
urge
no
good
reasons
in
opposition
to
it
but
contented
himself
with
recommending
that
the
execution
of
the
design
which
was
good
in
intention
should
however
be
postponed
for
two
years
bonaparte
appeared
to
listen
favourably
to
fouche
recommendation
who
as
avaricious
for
money
as
bonaparte
of
glory
consoled
himself
by
thinking
that
for
these
two
years
the
administration
of
the
gaming
tables
would
still
be
for
him
a
pactolus
flowing
with
gold
for
fouche
already
the
possessor
of
an
immense
fortune
always
dreamed
of
increasing
it
though
he
himself
did
not
know
how
to
enjoy
it
with
him
the
ambition
of
enlarging
the
bounds
of
his
estate
of
was
not
less
felt
than
with
the
first
consul
the
ambition
of
extending
the
frontier
of
france
not
only
did
the
first
consul
not
like
fouche
but
it
is
perfectly
true
that
at
this
time
the
police
wearied
and
annoyed
him
several
times
he
told
me
he
looked
on
it
as
dangerous
especially
for
the
possessor
of
power
in
a
government
without
the
liberty
of
the
press
he
was
quite
right
the
very
services
which
the
police
had
rendered
to
the
first
consul
were
of
a
nature
to
alarm
him
for
whoever
had
conspired
against
the
directory
in
favour
of
the
consulate
might
also
conspire
against
the
consulate
in
favour
of
any
other
government
it
is
needless
to
say
that
i
only
allude
to
the
political
police
and
not
to
the
municipal
police
which
is
indispensable
for
large
towns
and
which
has
the
honourable
mission
of
watching
over
the
health
and
safety
of
the
citizens
fouche
as
has
been
stated
had
been
minister
of
police
since
the
brumaire
everybody
who
was
acquainted
with
the
first
character
was
unable
to
explain
the
ascendency
which
he
had
suffered
fouche
to
acquire
over
him
and
of
which
bonaparte
himself
was
really
impatient
he
saw
in
fouche
a
centre
around
which
all
the
interests
of
the
revolution
concentrated
themselves
and
at
this
he
felt
indignant
but
subject
to
a
species
of
magnetism
he
could
not
break
the
charm
which
enthralled
him
when
he
spoke
of
fouche
in
his
absence
his
language
was
warm
bitter
and
hostile
when
fouche
was
present
bonaparte
tone
was
softened
unless
some
public
scene
was
to
be
acted
like
that
which
occurred
after
the
attempt
of
the
nivose
the
suppression
of
the
ministry
of
police
being
determined
on
bonaparte
did
not
choose
to
delay
the
execution
of
his
design
as
he
had
pretended
to
think
necessary
on
the
evening
of
the
of
september
we
went
to
mortfontaine
we
passed
the
next
day
which
was
monday
at
that
place
and
it
was
there
far
removed
from
fouche
and
urged
by
the
combined
persuasions
of
joseph
and
lucien
that
the
first
consul
signed
the
decree
of
suppression
the
next
morning
we
returned
to
paris
fouche
came
to
malmaison
where
we
were
in
the
regular
execution
of
his
duties
the
first
consul
transacted
business
with
him
as
usual
without
daring
to
tell
him
of
his
dismissal
and
afterwards
sent
cambaceres
to
inform
him
of
it
after
this
act
respecting
which
he
had
hesitated
so
long
bonaparte
still
endeavoured
to
modify
his
rigour
having
appointed
fouche
a
senator
he
said
in
the
letter
which
he
wrote
to
the
senate
to
notify
the
appointment
fouche
as
minister
of
police
in
times
of
difficulty
has
by
his
talent
his
activity
and
his
attachment
to
the
government
done
all
that
circumstances
required
of
him
placed
in
the
bosom
of
the
senate
if
events
should
again
call
for
a
minister
of
police
the
government
can
not
find
one
more
worthy
of
its
confidence
from
this
moment
the
departments
of
justice
and
police
united
were
confided
to
the
hands
of
regnier
bonaparte
aversion
for
fouche
strangely
blinded
him
with
respect
to
the
capabilities
of
his
successor
besides
how
could
the
administration
of
justice
which
rests
on
fixed
rigid
and
unchangeable
bases
proceed
hand
in
hand
with
another
administration
placed
on
the
quicksand
of
instantaneous
decisions
and
surrounded
by
stratagems
and
deceptions
justice
should
never
have
anything
to
do
with
secret
police
unless
it
be
to
condemn
it
abrial
minister
of
justice
was
called
to
the
senate
at
the
same
time
as
fouche
understanding
that
the
assimilation
of
the
two
men
was
more
a
disgrace
to
abrial
than
the
mere
loss
of
the
ministry
the
first
consul
said
to
abrial
in
uniting
the
ministry
of
police
to
that
of
justice
i
could
not
retain
yon
in
the
ministry
you
are
too
upright
a
man
to
manage
the
police
not
a
flattering
speech
for
bourrienne
what
could
be
expected
from
regnier
charged
as
he
was
with
incompatible
functions
what
under
such
circumstances
could
have
been
expected
even
from
a
man
gifted
with
great
talents
such
was
the
exact
history
of
fouche
disgrace
no
person
was
more
afflicted
at
it
than
madame
bonaparte
who
only
leaned
the
news
when
it
was
announced
to
the
public
josephine
on
all
occasions
defended
fouche
against
her
sallies
she
believed
that
he
was
the
only
one
of
his
ministers
who
told
him
the
truth
she
had
such
a
high
opinion
of
the
way
in
which
fouche
managed
the
police
that
the
first
time
i
was
alone
with
her
after
our
return
from
mortfontaine
she
said
to
me
my
dear
bourrienne
speak
openly
to
me
will
napoleon
know
all
about
the
plots
from
the
police
of
moncey
duroc
junot
and
of
davoust
you
know
better
than
i
do
that
these
are
only
wretched
spies
has
not
savary
also
eventually
got
his
police
how
all
this
alarms
me
they
take
away
all
my
supports
and
surround
me
only
with
enemies
to
justify
your
regrets
we
should
be
sure
that
fouche
has
never
been
in
agreement
with
lucien
in
favour
of
the
divorce
oh
i
do
not
believe
that
bonaparte
does
not
like
him
and
he
would
have
been
certain
to
tell
me
of
it
when
i
spoke
favourably
to
him
of
fouche
you
will
see
that
his
brothers
will
end
by
bringing
him
into
their
plan
i
have
already
spoken
of
josephine
troubles
and
of
the
bad
conduct
of
joseph
but
more
particularly
of
lucien
towards
her
i
will
therefore
describe
here
as
connected
with
the
disgrace
of
fouche
whom
madame
bonaparte
regretted
as
a
support
some
scenes
which
occurred
about
this
period
at
malmaison
having
been
the
confidant
of
both
parties
and
an
involuntary
actor
in
those
scenes
now
that
years
have
passed
since
they
occurred
what
motive
can
induce
me
to
disguise
the
truth
in
any
respect
madame
louis
bonaparte
was
enceinte
josephine
although
she
tenderly
loved
her
children
did
not
seem
to
behold
the
approaching
event
which
the
situation
of
her
daughter
indicated
with
the
interest
natural
to
the
heart
of
a
mother
she
had
long
been
aware
of
the
calumnious
reports
circulated
respecting
the
supposed
connection
between
hortense
and
the
first
consul
and
that
base
accusation
cost
her
many
tears
poor
josephine
paid
dearly
for
the
splendour
of
her
station
as
i
knew
how
devoid
of
foundation
these
atrocious
reports
were
i
endeavoured
to
console
her
by
telling
her
what
was
true
that
i
was
exerting
all
my
efforts
to
demonstrate
their
infamy
and
falsehood
bonaparte
however
dazzled
by
the
affection
which
was
manifested
towards
him
from
all
quarters
aggravated
the
sorrow
of
his
wife
by
a
silly
vanity
he
endeavoured
to
persuade
her
that
these
reports
had
their
origin
only
in
the
wish
of
the
public
that
he
should
have
a
child
so
that
these
seeming
consolations
offered
by
to
josephine
grief
gave
force
to
existing
conjugal
alarms
and
the
fear
of
divorce
returned
with
all
its
horrors
under
the
foolish
illusion
of
his
vanity
bonaparte
imagined
that
france
was
desirous
of
being
governed
even
by
a
bastard
if
supposed
to
be
a
child
of
his
a
singular
mode
truly
of
founding
a
new
legitimacy
josephine
whose
susceptibility
appears
to
me
even
now
excusable
well
knew
my
sentiments
on
the
subject
of
bonaparte
founding
a
dynasty
and
she
had
not
forgotten
my
conduct
when
two
years
before
the
question
had
been
agitated
on
the
occasion
of
louis
xviii
letters
to
the
first
consul
i
remember
that
one
day
after
the
publication
of
the
parallel
of
caesar
cromwell
and
bonaparte
josephine
having
entered
our
cabinet
without
being
announced
which
she
sometimes
did
when
from
the
good
humour
exhibited
at
breakfast
she
reckoned
upon
its
continuance
approached
bonaparte
softly
seated
herself
on
his
knee
passed
her
hand
gently
through
his
hair
and
over
his
face
and
thinking
the
moment
favourable
said
to
him
in
a
burst
of
tenderness
i
entreat
of
you
bonaparte
do
not
make
yourself
a
king
it
is
that
wretch
lucien
who
urges
you
to
it
do
not
listen
to
him
bonaparte
replied
without
anger
and
even
smiling
as
he
pronounced
the
last
words
you
are
mad
my
poor
josephine
it
is
your
old
dowagers
of
the
faubourg
germain
your
rochefoucaulds
who
tell
you
all
these
fables
come
now
you
interrupt
me
leave
me
alone
what
bonaparte
said
that
day
to
his
wife
i
have
often
heard
him
declare
seriously
i
have
been
present
at
five
or
six
altercations
on
the
subject
that
there
existed
too
an
enmity
connected
with
this
question
between
the
family
of
beauharnais
and
the
family
of
bonaparte
can
not
be
denied
fouche
as
i
have
stated
was
in
the
interest
of
josephine
and
lucien
was
the
most
bitter
of
her
enemies
one
day
raederer
inveighed
with
so
much
violence
against
fouche
in
the
presence
of
madame
bonaparte
that
she
replied
with
extreme
warmth
the
real
enemies
of
bonaparte
are
those
who
feed
him
with
notions
of
hereditary
descent
of
a
dynasty
of
divorce
and
of
marriage
josephine
could
not
check
this
exclamation
as
she
knew
that
roederer
encouraged
those
ideas
which
he
spread
abroad
by
lucien
direction
i
recollect
one
day
when
she
had
been
to
see
us
at
our
little
house
at
ruel
as
i
walked
with
her
along
the
high
road
to
her
carriage
which
she
had
sent
forward
i
acknowledged
too
unreservedly
my
fears
on
account
of
the
ambition
of
bonaparte
and
of
the
perfidious
advice
of
his
brothers
madame
said
i
if
we
can
not
succeed
in
dissuading
the
general
from
making
himself
a
king
i
dread
the
future
for
his
sake
if
ever
he
royalty
he
will
in
all
probability
labour
for
the
bourbons
and
enable
them
one
day
to
the
throne
which
he
shall
erect
no
one
doubtless
without
passing
for
a
fool
can
pretend
to
say
with
certainty
what
series
of
chances
and
events
such
a
proceeding
will
produce
but
common
sense
alone
is
sufficient
to
convince
any
one
that
unfavourable
chances
must
long
be
dreaded
the
ancient
system
being
the
occupation
of
the
throne
will
then
be
only
a
family
question
and
not
a
question
of
government
between
liberty
and
despotic
power
why
should
not
france
if
it
ceases
to
be
free
prefer
the
race
of
her
ancient
kings
you
surely
know
it
you
had
not
been
married
two
years
when
on
returning
from
italy
your
husband
told
me
that
he
aspired
to
royalty
now
he
is
consul
for
life
would
he
but
resolve
to
stop
there
he
already
possesses
everything
but
an
empty
title
no
sovereign
in
europe
has
so
much
power
as
he
has
i
am
sorry
for
it
madame
but
i
really
believe
that
in
spite
of
yourself
you
will
be
made
queen
or
empress
madame
bonaparte
had
allowed
me
to
speak
without
interruption
but
when
i
pronounced
the
words
queen
and
empress
she
exclaimed
my
god
bourrienne
such
ambition
is
far
from
my
thoughts
that
i
may
always
continue
the
wife
of
the
first
consul
is
all
i
desire
say
to
him
all
that
you
have
said
to
me
try
and
prevent
him
from
making
himself
king
madame
i
replied
times
are
greatly
altered
the
wisest
men
the
strongest
minds
have
resolutely
and
courageously
opposed
his
tendency
to
the
hereditary
system
but
advice
is
now
useless
he
would
not
listen
to
me
in
all
discussions
on
the
subject
he
adheres
inflexibly
to
the
view
he
has
taken
if
he
be
seriously
opposed
his
anger
knows
no
bounds
his
language
is
harsh
and
abrupt
his
tone
imperious
and
his
authority
bears
down
all
before
him
yet
bourrienne
he
has
so
much
confidence
in
you
that
of
you
should
try
once
more
madame
i
assure
you
he
will
not
listen
to
me
besides
what
could
i
add
to
the
remarks
i
made
upon
his
receiving
the
letters
of
louis
when
i
fearlessly
represented
to
him
that
being
without
children
he
would
have
no
one
to
whom
to
bequeath
the
throne
that
doubtless
from
the
opinion
which
be
entertained
of
his
brothers
he
could
not
desire
to
erect
it
for
them
here
josephine
again
interrupted
me
by
exclaiming
my
kind
friend
when
you
spoke
of
children
did
he
say
anything
to
you
did
he
talk
of
a
divorce
not
a
word
madame
i
assure
you
if
they
do
not
urge
him
to
it
i
do
not
believe
he
will
resolve
to
do
such
a
thing
you
know
how
he
likes
eugene
and
eugene
behaves
so
well
to
him
how
different
is
lucien
it
is
that
wretch
lucien
to
whom
bonaparte
listens
too
much
and
of
whom
however
he
always
speaks
ill
to
me
i
do
not
know
madame
what
lucien
says
to
his
brother
except
when
he
chooses
to
tell
me
because
lucien
always
avoids
having
a
witness
of
his
interviews
with
your
husband
but
i
can
assure
you
that
for
two
years
i
have
not
heard
the
word
from
the
general
mouth
i
always
reckon
on
you
my
dear
bourrienne
to
turn
him
away
from
it
as
you
did
at
that
time
i
do
not
believe
he
is
thinking
of
it
but
if
it
recurs
to
him
consider
madame
that
it
will
be
now
from
very
different
motives
he
is
now
entirely
given
up
to
the
interests
of
his
policy
and
his
ambition
which
dominate
every
other
feeling
in
him
there
will
not
now
be
any
question
of
scandal
or
of
a
trial
before
a
court
but
of
an
act
of
authority
which
complaisant
laws
will
justify
and
which
the
church
perhaps
will
sanction
that
true
you
are
right
good
god
how
unhappy
i
am
when
bourrienne
complains
of
not
knowing
what
passed
between
lucien
and
napoleon
we
can
turn
to
lucien
account
of
bourrienne
apparently
about
this
very
time
after
a
stormy
interview
with
napoleon
says
lucien
i
at
once
went
into
the
cabinet
where
bourrienne
was
working
and
found
that
unbearable
busybody
of
a
secretary
whose
star
had
already
paled
more
than
once
which
made
him
more
prying
than
ever
quite
upset
by
the
time
the
first
consul
had
taken
to
come
out
of
his
bath
he
must
or
at
least
might
have
heard
some
noise
for
enough
had
been
made
seeing
that
he
wanted
to
know
the
cause
from
me
i
took
up
a
newspaper
to
avoid
being
bored
by
his
conversation
iung
lucien
tome
ii
such
was
the
nature
of
one
of
the
conversations
i
had
with
madame
bonaparte
on
a
subject
to
which
she
often
recurred
it
may
not
perhaps
be
uninteresting
to
endeavour
to
compare
with
this
what
napoleon
said
at
helena
speaking
of
his
first
wife
according
to
the
memorial
napoleon
there
stated
that
when
josephine
was
at
last
constrained
to
renounce
all
hope
of
having
a
child
she
often
let
fall
allusions
to
a
great
political
fraud
and
at
length
openly
proposed
it
to
him
i
make
no
doubt
bonaparte
made
use
of
words
to
this
effect
but
i
do
not
believe
the
assertion
i
recollect
one
day
that
bonaparte
on
entering
our
cabinet
where
i
was
already
seated
exclaimed
in
a
transport
of
joy
impossible
for
me
to
describe
well
bourrienne
my
wife
is
at
last
enceinte
i
sincerely
congratulated
him
more
i
own
out
of
courtesy
than
from
any
hope
of
seeing
him
made
a
father
by
josephine
for
i
well
remembered
that
corvisart
who
had
given
medicines
to
madame
bonaparte
had
nevertheless
assured
me
that
he
expected
no
result
from
them
medicine
was
really
the
only
political
fraud
to
which
josephine
had
recourse
and
in
her
situation
what
other
woman
would
not
have
done
as
much
here
then
the
husband
and
the
wife
are
in
contradiction
which
is
nothing
uncommon
but
on
which
side
is
truth
i
have
no
hesitation
in
referring
it
to
josephine
there
is
indeed
an
immense
difference
between
the
statements
of
a
women
trusting
her
fears
and
her
hopes
to
the
sole
confidant
of
her
family
secrets
and
the
tardy
declaration
of
a
man
who
after
seeing
the
vast
edifice
of
his
ambition
leveled
with
the
dust
is
only
anxious
in
his
compulsory
retreat
to
preserve
intact
and
spotless
the
other
great
edifice
of
his
glory
bonaparte
should
have
recollected
that
caesar
did
not
like
the
idea
of
his

by

arrived

triumph
at

in
appearance
over
the
scruples
which
the
persons
who
surrounded
him
had
manifested
against
the
of
worship
he
read
with
much
the
reports
made
to
him
in
which
it
was
stated
that
the
churches
were
well
frequented
indeed
throughout
the
year
all
his
attention

directed
to
the
reformation
of
manners
which
had
become
more
dissolute
under
the
directory
than
even
during
the
reign
of
terror
in
his
march
of
usurpation
the
first
consul
let
slip
no
opportunity
of
endeavouring
to
obtain
at
the
same
time
the
admiration
of
the
multitude
and
the
approbation
of
judicious
men
he
was
very
fond
of
the
arts
and
was
sensible
that
the
promotion
of
industry
ought
to
be
the
peculiar
care
of
the
head
of
the
government
it
must
however
at
the
same
time
be
owned
that
he
rendered
the
influence
of
his
protection
null
and
void
by
the
continual
violations
he
committed
on
that
liberty
which
is
the
animating
principle
of
all
improvement
during
the
supplementary
days
of
the
year
that
is
to
say
about
the
beginning
of
the
autumn
of
there
was
held
at
the
louvre
an
exhibition
of
the
products
of
industry
the
first
consul
visited
the
exhibition
and
as
even
at
that
period
he
had
begun
to
attribute
every
good
result
to
himself
he
seemed
proud
of
the
high
degree
of
perfection
the
manufacturing
arts
had
attained
in
france
he
was
above
all
delighted
with
the
admiration
this
exhibition
excited
among
the
numerous
foreigners
who
resorted
to
paris
during
the
peace
in
fact
throughout
the
year
the
capital
presented
an
interesting
and
the
appetite
for
luxury
and
pleasure
had
insinuated
itself
into
manners
which
were
no
longer
republican
and
the
vast
number
of
russians
and
english
who
drove
about
everywhere
with
brilliant
equipages
contributed
not
a
little
to
this
metamorphosis
all
paris
flocked
to
the
carrousel
on
review
days
and
regarded
with
eyes
of
delight
the
unusual
sight
of
rich
foreign
liveries
and
emblazoned
carriages
the
parties
at
the
tuileries
were
brilliant
and
numerous
and
nothing
was
wanting
but
the
name
of
levees
count
markoff
who
succeeded
de
kalitscheff
as
russian
ambassador
the
marquis
de
lucchesini
the
prussian
ambassador
and
lord
whitworth
the
minister
from
england
made
numerous
presentations
of
their
countrymen
to
the
first
consul
who
was
well
pleased
that
the
court
he
was
forming
should
have
examples
set
by
foreign
courtiers
never
since
the
meeting
of
the
had
the
theatres
been
so
frequented
or
fetes
so
magnificent
and
never
since
that
period
had
paris
presented
so
cheering
an
aspect
the
first
consul
on
his
part
spared
no
exertion
to
render
the
capital
more
and
more
worthy
the
admiration
of
foreigners
the
statue
of
the
venus
de
medicis
which
had
been
robbed
from
the
gallery
of
the
grand
duke
of
tuscany
now
decorated
the
gallery
of
the
louvre
and
near
it
was
placed
that
of
the
velletrian
pallas
a
more
legitimate
acquisition
since
it
was
the
result
of
the
researches
of
some
french
engineers
at
velletri
everywhere
an
air
of
prosperity
was
perceptible
and
bonaparte
proudly
put
in
his
claim
to
be
regarded
as
the
author
of
it
all
with
what
heartfelt
satisfaction
did
he
likewise
cast
his
eye
upon
what
he
called
the
grand
thermometer
of
opinion
the
price
of
the
funds
for
if
he
saw
them
doubled
in
value
in
consequence
of
the
revolution
of
the
brumaire
rising
as
they
did
at
that
period
from
seven
to
sixteen
francs
this
value
was
even
more
than
tripled
after
the
vote
of
consulship
for
life
and
the
of
the
of
august
when
they
rose
to
francs
while
paris
presented
so
satisfactory
an
aspect
the
departments
were
in
a
state
of
perfect
tranquillity
and
foreign
affairs
had
every
appearance
of
security
the
court
of
the
vatican
which
since
the
concordat
may
be
said
to
have
become
devoted
to
the
first
consul
gave
under
all
circumstances
examples
of
submission
to
the
wishes
of
france
the
vatican
was
the
first
court
which
recognised
the
erection
of
tuscany
into
the
kingdom
of
etruria
and
the
formation
of
the
helvetic
cisalpine
and
batavian
republics
prussia
soon
followed
the
example
of
the
pope
which
was
successively
imitated
by
the
other
powers
of
europe
the
whole
of
these
new
states
realms
or
republics
were
under
the
immediate
influence
of
france
the
isle
of
elba
which
napoleon
first
abdication
afterwards
rendered
so
famous
and
piedmont
divided
into
six
departments
were
also
united
to
france
still
called
it
republic
everything
now
seemed
to
concur
in
securing
his
accession
to
absolute
power
we
were
now
at
peace
with
all
the
world
and
every
circumstance
tended
to
place
in
the
hands
of
the
first
consul
that
absolute
power
which
indeed
was
the
only
kind
of
government
be
was
capable
of
forming
any
conception
of
indeed
one
of
the
characteristic
signs
of
government
even
under
the
consular
system
left
no
doubt
as
to
his
real
intentions
had
he
wished
to
found
a
free
government
it
is
evident
that
he
world
have
made
the
ministers
responsible
to
the
country
whereas
he
took
care
that
there
should
be
no
responsibility
but
to
himself
he
viewed
them
in
fact
in
the
light
of
instruments
which
he
might
break
as
be
pleased
i
found
this
single
index
sufficient
to
disclose
all
his
future
designs
in
order
to
make
the
irresponsibility
of
his
ministers
to
the
public
perfectly
clear
he
had
all
the
acts
of
his
government
signed
merely
by
maret
secretary
of
state
thus
the
consulship
for
life
was
nothing
but
an
empire
in
disguise
the
usufruct
of
which
could
not
long
satisfy
the
first
consul
ambition
his
brothers
influenced
him
and
it
was
resolved
to
found
a
new
dynasty
it
was
not
in
the
interior
of
france
that
difficulties
were
likely
first
to
arise
on
bonaparte
carrying
his
designs
into
effect
but
there
was
some
reason
to
apprehend
that
foreign
powers
after
recognising
and
treating
with
the
consular
government
might
display
a
different
feeling
and
entertain
scruples
with
regard
to
a
government
which
had
resumed
its
monarchical
form
the
question
regarding
the
bourbons
was
in
some
measure
kept
in
the
background
as
long
as
france
remained
a
republic
but
the
of
the
throne
naturally
called
to
recollection
the
family
which
had
occupied
it
for
so
many
ages
bonaparte
fully
felt
the
delicacy
of
his
position
but
he
knew
how
to
face
obstacles
and
had
been
accustomed
to
overcome
them
he
however
always
proceeded
cautiously
as
when
obstacles
induced
him
to
defer
the
period
of
the
consulship
for
life
bonaparte
laboured
to
establish
iii
france
not
only
an
absolute
government
but
what
is
still
worse
a
military
one
he
considered
a
decree
signed
by
his
hand
possessed
of
a
magic
virtue
capable
of
transforming
his
generals
into
able
diplomatists
and
so
he
sent
them
on
embassies
as
if
to
show
the
sovereigns
to
whom
they
were
accredited
that
he
soon
meant
to
take
their
thrones
by
assault
the
appointment
of
lannes
to
the
court
of
lisbon
originated
from
causes
which
probably
will
be
read
with
some
interest
since
they
serve
to
place
character
in
its
true
light
and
to
point
out
at
the
same
time
the
means
he
disdained
not
to
resort
to
if
he
wished
to
banish
his
most
faithful
friends
when
their
presence
was
no
longer
agreeable
to
him
bonaparte
had
ceased
to
address
lannes
in
the
second
person
singular
but
that
general
continued
the
familiarity
of
thee
and
thou
in
speaking
to
napoleon
it
is
hardly
possible
to
conceive
how
much
this
annoyed
the
first
consul
aware
of
the
unceremonious
candour
of
his
old
comrade
whose
daring
spirit
he
knew
would
prompt
him
to
go
as
great
lengths
in
civil
affairs
as
on
the
field
of
battle
bonaparte
on
the
great
occasion
of
the
brumaire
fearing
his
reproaches
had
given
him
the
command
of
paris
in
order
to
ensure
his
absence
from
st
cloud
after
that
time
notwithstanding
the
continually
growing
greatness
of
the
first
consul
which
as
it
increased
daily
exacted
more
and
more
deference
lannes
still
preserved
his
freedom
of
speech
and
was
the
only
one
who
dared
to
treat
bonaparte
as
a
comrade
and
tell
him
the
truth
without
ceremony
this
was
enough
to
determine
napoleon
to
rid
himself
of
the
presence
of
lannes
but
under
what
pretest
was
the
absence
of
the
conqueror
of
montebello
to
be
procured
it
was
necessary
to
conjure
up
an
excuse
and
in
the
truly
diabolical
machination
resorted
to
for
that
purpose
bonaparte
brought
into
play
that
crafty
disposition
for
which
he
was
so
remarkable
lannes
who
never
looked
forward
to
the
morrow
was
as
careless
of
his
money
as
of
his
blood
poor
officers
and
soldiers
partook
largely
of
his
liberality
thus
he
had
no
fortune
but
plenty
of
debts
when
he
wanted
money
and
this
was
not
seldom
he
used
to
come
as
if
it
were
a
mere
matter
of
course
to
ask
it
of
the
first
consul
who
i
must
confess
never
refused
him
bonaparte
though
he
well
knew
the
circumstances
said
to
him
one
day
my
friend
you
should
attend
a
little
more
to
appearances
you
must
have
your
establishment
suitable
to
your
rank
there
is
the
hotel
de
noailles
why
do
you
take
it
and
furnish
it
in
proper
style
lannes
whose
own
candour
prevented
him
from
suspecting
the
artful
designs
of
others
followed
the
advice
of
the
first
consul
the
hotel
de
noailles
was
taken
and
superbly
fitted
up
odiot
supplied
a
service
of
plate
valued
at
francs
general
lannes
having
thus
conformed
to
the
wishes
of
bonaparte
came
to
him
and
requested
francs
the
amount
of
the
expense
incurred
as
it
were
by
his
order
but
said
the
first
consul
i
have
no
money
you
have
no
money
what
the
devil
am
i
to
do
then
but
is
there
none
in
the
guard
chest
take
what
you
require
and
we
will
settle
it
hereafter
mistrusting
nothing
lannes
went
to
the
treasurer
of
the
guards
who
made
some
objections
at
first
to
the
advance
required
but
who
soon
yielded
on
learning
that
the
demand
was
made
with
the
consent
of
the
first
consul
within
hours
after
lannes
had
obtained
the
francs
the
treasurer
received
from
the
head
commissary
an
order
to
balance
his
accounts
the
receipt
for
the
francs
advanced
to
lannes
was
not
acknowledged
as
a
voucher
in
vain
the
treasurer
alleged
the
authority
of
the
first
consul
for
the
transaction
napoleon
memory
had
suddenly
failed
him
he
had
entirely
forgotten
all
about
it
in
a
word
it
was
incumbent
on
lannes
to
refund
the
francs
to
the
guards
chest
and
as
i
have
already
said
he
had
no
property
on
earth
but
debts
in
abundance
he
repaired
to
general
lefebre
who
loved
him
as
his
son
and
to
him
he
related
all
that
had
passed
simpleton
said
lefebvre
why
did
you
not
come
to
me
why
did
you
go
and
get
into
debt
with
that
well
here
are
the
francs
take
them
to
him
and
let
him
go
to
the
devil
lannes
hastened
to
the
first
consul
what
he
exclaimed
is
it
possible
you
can
be
guilty
of
such
baseness
as
this
to
treat
me
in
such
a
manner
to
lay
such
a
foul
snare
for
me
after
all
that
i
have
done
for
you
after
all
the
blood
i
have
shed
to
promote
your
ambition
is
this
the
recompense
you
had
in
store
for
me
you
forget
the
vendemiaire
to
the
success
of
which
i
contributed
more
than
you
you
forget
millesimo
i
was
colonel
before
you
for
whom
did
i
fight
at
bassano
you
were
witness
of
what
i
did
at
lodi
and
at
governolo
where
i
was
wounded
and
yet
you
play
me
such
a
trick
as
this
but
for
me
paris
would
have
revolted
on
the
brumaire
but
for
me
you
would
have
lost
the
battle
of
marengo
i
alone
yes
i
alone
passed
the
po
at
montebello
with
my
whole
division
you
gave
the
credit
of
that
to
berthier
who
was
not
there
and
this
is
my
reward
humiliation
this
can
not
this
shall
not
be
i
will
bonaparte
pale
with
anger
listened
without
stirring
and
lannes
was
on
the
point
of
challenging
him
when
junot
who
heard
the
uproar
hastily
entered
the
unexpected
presence
of
this
general
somewhat
reassured
the
first
consul
and
at
the
same
time
calmed
in
some
degree
the
fury
of
lannes
well
said
bonaparte
go
to
lisbon
you
will
get
money
there
and
when
you
return
you
will
not
want
any
one
to
pay
your
debts
for
you
thus
was
bonaparte
object
gained
lannes
set
out
for
lisbon
and
never
afterwards
annoyed
the
first
consul
by
his
familiarities
for
on
his
return
he
ceased
to
address
him
with
thee
and
thou
having
described
bonaparte
of
lannes
i
may
here
subjoin
a
statement
of
the
circumstances
which
led
to
a
rupture
between
the
first
consul
and
me
so
many
false
stories
have
been
circulated
on
the
subject
that
i
am
anxious
to
relate
the
facts
as
they
really
were
nine
months
had
now
passed
since
i
had
tendered
my
resignation
to
the
first
consul
the
business
of
my
office
had
become
too
great
for
me
and
my
health
was
so
much
endangered
by
that
my
physician
corvisart
who
had
for
a
long
time
impressed
upon
me
the
necessity
of
relaxation
now
formally
warned
me
that
i
should
not
long
hold
out
under
the
fatigue
i
underwent
corvisart
had
no
doubt
spoken
to
the
same
effect
to
the
first
consul
for
the
latter
said
to
me
one
day
in
a
tone
which
betrayed
but
little
feeling
why
corvisart
says
you
have
not
a
year
to
live
this
was
certainly
no
very
welcome
compliment
in
the
mouth
of
an
old
college
friend
yet
i
must
confess
that
the
doctor
risked
little
by
the
prediction
i
had
resolved
in
fact
to
follow
the
advice
of
corvisart
my
family
were
urgent
in
their
entreaties
that
i
would
do
so
but
i
always
put
off
the
decisive
step
i
was
loath
to
give
up
a
friendship
which
had
subsisted
so
long
and
which
had
been
only
once
disturbed
on
that
occasion
when
joseph
thought
proper
to
play
the
spy
upon
me
at
the
table
of
fouche
i
remembered
also
the
reception
i
had
met
with
from
the
conqueror
of
italy
and
i
experienced
moreover
no
slight
pain
at
the
thought
of
quitting
one
from
whom
i
had
received
so
many
proofs
of
confidence
and
to
whom
i
had
been
attached
from
early
boyhood
these
considerations
constantly
triumphed
over
the
disgust
to
which
i
was
subjected
by
a
number
of
circumstances
and
by
the
increasing
vexations
occasioned
by
the
conflict
between
my
private
sentiments
and
the
nature
of
the
duties
i
had
to
perform
i
was
thus
kept
in
a
state
of
perplexity
from
which
some
unforeseen
circumstance
alone
could
extricate
me
such
a
circumstance
at
length
occurred
and
the
following
is
the
history
of
my
first
rupture
with
napoleon
on
the
of
february
at
ten
at
night
bonaparte
dictated
to
me
a
despatch
of
considerable
importance
and
urgency
for
de
talleyrand
requesting
the
minister
for
foreign
affairs
to
come
to
the
tuileries
next
morning
at
an
appointed
hour
according
to
custom
i
put
the
letter
into
the
hands
of
the
office
messenger
that
it
might
be
forwarded
to
its
destination
this
was
saturday
the
following
day
sunday
de
talleyrand
came
as
if
for
an
audience
about
the
first
consul
immediately
began
to
confer
with
him
on
the
subject
of
the
letter
sent
the
previous
evening
and
was
astonished
to
learn
that
the
minister
had
not
received
it
until
the
morning
he
immediately
rang
for
the
messenger
and
ordered
me
to
be
sent
for
being
in
a
very
bad
humour
he
pulled
the
bell
with
so
much
fury
that
he
struck
his
hand
violently
against
the
angle
of
the
i
hurried
to
his
presence
why
he
said
addressing
me
hastily
why
was
not
my
letter
delivered
yesterday
evening
i
do
not
know
i
put
it
at
once
into
the
hands
of
the
person
whose
duty
it
was
to
see
that
it
was
sent
go
and
find
the
cause
of
the
delay
and
come
back
quickly
having
rapidly
made
my
inquiries
i
returned
to
the
cabinet
well
said
the
first
consul
whose
irritation
seemed
to
have
increased
well
general
it
is
not
the
fault
of
anybody
de
talleyrand
was
not
to
be
found
either
at
the
office
or
at
his
own
residence
or
at
the
houses
of
any
of
his
friends
where
he
was
thought
likely
to
be
not
knowing
with
whom
to
be
angry
restrained
by
the
coolness
of
de
talleyrand
yet
at
the
same
time
ready
to
burst
with
rage
bonaparte
rose
from
his
seat
and
proceeding
to
the
hall
called
the
messenger
and
questioned
him
sharply
the
man
disconcerted
by
the
anger
of
the
first
consul
hesitated
in
his
replies
and
gave
confused
answers
bonaparte
returned
to
his
cabinet
still
more
irritated
than
he
had
left
it
i
had
followed
him
to
the
hall
and
on
my
way
back
to
the
cabinet
i
attempted
to
soothe
him
and
i
begged
him
not
to
be
thus
discomposed
by
a
circumstance
which
after
all
was
of
no
great
moment
i
do
not
know
whether
his
anger
was
increased
by
the
sight
of
the
blood
which
flowed
from
his
hand
and
which
he
was
every
moment
looking
at
but
however
that
might
be
a
transport
of
furious
passion
such
as
i
had
never
before
witnessed
seized
him
and
as
i
was
about
to
enter
the
cabinet
after
him
he
threw
back
the
door
with
so
much
violence
that
had
i
been
two
or
three
inches
nearer
him
it
must
infallibly
have
struck
me
in
the
face
he
accompanied
this
action
which
was
almost
convulsive
with
an
appellation
not
to
be
borne
he
exclaimed
before
de
talleyrand
leave
me
alone
you
are
a
fool
at
an
insult
so
atrocious
i
confess
that
the
anger
which
had
already
mastered
the
first
consul
suddenly
seized
on
me
i
thrust
the
door
forward
with
as
much
impetuosity
as
he
had
used
in
throwing
it
back
and
scarcely
knowing
what
i
said
exclaimed
you
are
a
hundredfold
a
greater
fool
than
i
am
i
then
banged
the
door
and
went
upstairs
to
my
apartment
which
was
situated
over
the
cabinet
i
was
as
far
from
expecting
as
from
wishing
such
an
occasion
of
separating
from
the
first
consul
but
what
was
done
could
not
be
undone
and
therefore
without
taking
time
for
reflection
and
still
under
the
influence
of
the
anger
that
had
got
the
better
of
me
i
penned
the
following
positive
resignation
general
the
state
of
my
health
no
longer
permits
me
to
continue
in
your
service
i
therefore
beg
you
to
accept
my
resignation
bourrienne
some
moments
after
this
note
was
written
i
saw
bonaparte
brought
up
to
the
entrance
of
the
palace
it
was
sunday
morning
and
contrary
to
his
usual
custom
on
that
day
he
was
going
to
ride
out
duroc
accompanied
him
he
was
no
sooner
done
than
i
went
down
into
his
cabinet
and
placed
my
letter
on
his
table
on
returning
at
four
with
duroc
bonaparte
read
my
letter
ah
ah
said
he
before
opening
it
a
letter
from
bourrienne
and
he
almost
immediately
added
for
the
note
was
speedily
perused
he
is
in
the
accepted
i
had
left
the
tuileries
at
the
moment
he
returned
but
duroc
sent
to
me
where
i
was
dining
the
following
billet
the
first
consul
desires
me
my
dear
bourrienne
to
inform
you
that
he
accepts
your
resignation
and
to
request
that
you
will
give
me
the
necessary
information
respecting
your
yours
duroc
i
will
call
on
you
presently
duroc
came
to
me
at
eight
the
same
evening
the
first
consul
was
in
his
cabinet
when
we
entered
it
i
immediately
commenced
giving
my
intended
successor
the
necessary
explanations
to
enable
him
to
enter
upon
his
new
duties
piqued
at
finding
that
i
did
not
speak
to
him
and
at
the
coolness
with
which
i
instructed
duroc
bonaparte
said
to
me
in
a
harsh
tone
come
i
have
had
enough
of
this
leave
me
i
stepped
down
from
the
ladder
on
which
i
had
mounted
for
the
purpose
of
pointing
out
to
duroc
the
places
in
which
the
various
papers
were
deposited
and
hastily
withdrew
i
too
had
quite
enough
of
it
i
remained
two
more
days
at
the
tuileries
until
i
had
suited
myself
with
lodgings
on
monday
i
went
down
into
the
cabinet
of
the
first
consul
to
take
my
leave
of
him
we
conversed
together
for
a
long
time
and
very
amicably
he
told
me
he
was
very
sorry
i
was
going
to
leave
him
and
that
he
would
do
all
he
could
for
me
i
pointed
out
several
places
to
him
at
last
i
mentioned
the
tribunate
that
will
not
do
for
you
he
said
the
members
are
a
set
of
babblers
and
phrasemongers
whom
i
mean
to
get
rid
of
all
the
troubles
of
states
proceed
from
such
debatings
i
am
tired
of
them
he
continued
to
talk
in
a
strain
which
left
me
in
no
doubt
as
to
his
uneasiness
about
the
tribunate
which
in
fact
reckoned
among
its
members
many
men
of
great
talent
and
excellent
character
in
the
first
consul
made
a
reduction
of
fifty
members
of
the
tribunate
and
subsequently
the
whole
body
was
suppressed
bourrienne
the
following
day
tuesday
the
first
consul
asked
me
to
breakfast
with
him
after
breakfast
while
he
was
conversing
with
some
other
person
madame
bonaparte
and
hortense
pressed
me
to
make
advances
towards
obtaining
a
in
my
office
appealing
to
me
on
the
score
of
the
friendship
and
kindness
they
had
always
shown
me
they
told
me
that
i
had
been
in
the
wrong
and
that
i
had
forgotten
myself
i
answered
that
i
considered
the
evil
beyond
remedy
and
that
besides
i
had
really
need
of
repose
the
first
consul
then
called
me
to
him
and
conversed
a
considerable
time
with
me
renewing
his
protestations
of
goodwill
towards
me
at
five
i
was
going
downstairs
to
quit
the
tuileries
for
good
when
i
was
met
by
the
office
messenger
who
told
me
that
the
first
consul
wished
to
see
me
duroc
who
was
in
the
room
leading
to
the
cabinet
stopped
me
as
i
passed
and
said
he
wishes
you
to
remain
i
beg
of
you
not
to
refuse
do
me
this
favour
i
have
assured
him
that
i
am
incapable
of
filling
your
office
it
does
not
suit
my
habits
and
besides
to
tell
you
the
truth
the
business
is
too
irksome
for
me
i
proceeded
to
the
cabinet
without
replying
to
duroc
the
first
consul
came
up
to
me
smiling
and
pulling
me
by
the
ear
as
he
did
when
he
was
in
the
best
of
humours
said
to
me
are
you
still
in
the
sulks
and
leading
me
to
my
usual
seat
he
added
come
sit
down
only
those
who
knew
bonaparte
can
judge
of
my
situation
at
that
moment
he
had
at
times
and
when
he
chose
a
charm
in
his
manners
which
it
was
quite
impossible
to
resist
i
could
offer
no
opposition
and
i
resumed
my
usual
office
and
my
accustomed
labours
five
minutes
afterwards
it
was
announced
that
dinner
was
on
table
you
will
dine
with
me
he
said
i
can
not
i
am
expected
at
the
place
where
i
was
going
when
duroc
called
me
back
it
is
an
engagement
that
i
can
not
break
well
i
have
nothing
to
say
then
but
give
me
your
word
that
you
will
be
here
at
eight
i
promise
you
thus
i
became
again
the
private
secretary
of
the
first
consul
and
i

the

our
reconciliation

be
assigned
to
many
causes
and
i
had
the
opportunity
of
observing
the
influence
which
the
determined
will
of
one
man
exercised
over
his
men
the
great
object
which
bonaparte
had
at
heart
was
to
legitimate
his
usurpations
by
institutions
the
concordat
had
reconciled
him
with
the
court
of
rome
the
numerous
erasures
from
the
emigrant
list
gathered
round
him
a
large
body
of
the
old
nobility
and
the
legion
of
honour
though
at
first
but
badly
received
soon
became
a
general
object
of
ambition
peace
too
had
lent
her
aid
in
consolidating
the
first
consul
power
by
affording
him
leisure
to
engage
in
measures
of
internal
prosperity
the
council
of
state
of
which
bonaparte
had
made
me
a
member
but
which
my
other
occupations
did
not
allow
me
to
attend
was
the
soul
of
the
consular
government
bonaparte
felt
much
interest
in
the
discussions
of
that
body
because
it
was
composed
of
the
most
eminent
men
in
the
different
branches
of
administration
and
though
the
majority
evinced
a
ready
compliance
with
his
wishes
yet
that
disposition
was
often
far
from
being
unanimous
in
the
council
of
state
the
projects
of
the
government
were
discussed
from
the
first
with
freedom
and
sincerity
and
when
once
adopted
they
were
transmitted
to
the
tribunate
and
to
the
legislative
body
this
latter
body
might
be
considered
as
a
supreme
legislative
tribunal
before
which
the
tribunes
pleaded
as
the
advocates
of
the
people
and
the
councillors
of
state
whose
business
it
was
to
support
the
law
projects
as
the
advocates
of
the
government
this
will
at
once
explain
the
cause
of
the
first
consul
animosity
towards
the
tribunate
and
will
show
to
what
the
constitution
was
reduced
when
that
body
was
dissolved
by
a
sudden
and
arbitrary
decision
during
the
consulate
the
council
of
state
was
not
only
a
body
politic
collectively
but
each
individual
member
might
be
invested
with
special
power
as
for
example
when
the
first
consul
sent
councillors
of
state
on
missions
to
each
of
the
military
divisions
where
there
was
a
court
of
appeal
the
instructions
given
them
by
the
first
consul
were
extensive
and
might
be
said
to
be
unlimited
they
were
directed
to
examine
all
the
branches
of
the
administration
so
that
their
reports
collected
and
compared
together
presented
a
perfect
description
of
the
state
of
france
but
this
measure
though
excellent
in
itself
proved
fatal
to
the
state
the
reports
never
conveyed
the
truth
to
the
first
consul
or
at
least
if
they
did
it
was
in
such
a
disguised
form
as
to
be
scarcely
recognisable
for
the
councillors
well
knew
that
the
best
way
to
pay
their
court
to
bonaparte
was
not
to
describe
public
feeling
as
it
really
was
but
as
he
wished
it
to
be
thus
the
reports
of
the
councillors
of
state
only
furnished
fresh
arguments
in
favour
of
his
ambition
i
must
however
observe
that
in
the
discussions
of
the
council
of
state
bonaparte
was
not
at
all
averse
to
the
free
expression
of
opinion
he
indeed
often
encouraged
it
for
although
fully
resolved
to
do
only
what
he
pleased
he
wished
to
gain
information
indeed
it
is
scarcely
conceivable
how
in
the
short
space
of
two
years
bonaparte
adapted
his
mind
so
completely
to
civil
and
legislative
affairs
but
he
could
not
endure
in
the
tribunate
the
liberty
of
opinion
which
he
tolerated
in
the
council
and
for
this
reason
that
the
sittings
of
the
tribunate
were
public
while
those
of
the
council
of
state
were
secret
and
publicity
was
what
he
dreaded
above
all
things
he
was
very
well
pleased
when
he
had
to
transmit
to
the
legislative
body
or
to
the
tribunate
any
proposed
law
of
trifling
importance
and
he
used
then
to
say
that
he
had
thrown
them
a
bone
to
gnaw
among
the
subjects
submitted
to
the
consideration
of
the
council
and
the
tribunate
was
one
which
gave
rise
to
a
singular
discussion
the
ground
of
which
was
a
particular
word
inserted
in
the
third
article
of
the
treaty
of
russia
with
france
this
word
seemed
to
convey
a
prophetic
allusion
to
the
future
condition
of
the
french
people
or
rather
an
anticipated
designation
of
what
they
afterwards
became
the
treaty
spoke
of
the
subjects
of
the
two
governments
this
term
applied
to
those
who
still
considered
themselves
citizens
and
was
highly
offensive
to
the
tribunate
chenier
most
loudly
remonstrated
against
the
introduction
of
this
word
into
the
dictionary
of
the
new
government
he
said
that
the
armies
of
france
had
shed
their
blood
that
the
french
people
might
be
citizens
and
not
subjects
chenier
arguments
however
had
no
effect
on
the
decision
of
the
tribunate
and
only
served
to
irritate
the
first
consul
the
treaty
was
adopted
almost
unanimously
there
being
only
fourteen
dissentient
voices
and
the
proportion
of
black
balls
in
the
legislative
body
was
even
less
though
this
discussion
passed
off
almost
unnoticed
yet
it
greatly
displeased
the
first
consul
who
expressed
his
dissatisfaction
in
the
evening
what
is
it
said
he
these
babblers
want
they
wish
to
be
citizens
why
did
they
not
know
how
to
continue
so
my
government
must
treat
on
an
equal
footing
with
russia
i
should
appear
a
mere
puppet
in
the
eyes
of
foreign
courts
were
i
to
yield
to
the
stupid
demands
of
the
those
fellows
tease
me
so
that
i
have
a
great
mind
to
end
matters
at
once
with
them
i
endeavoured
to
soothe
his
anger
and
observed
that
one
precipitate
act
might
injure
him
you
are
right
he
continued
but
stay
a
little
they
shall
lose
nothing
by
waiting
the
tribunate
pleased
bonaparte
better
in
the
great
question
of
the
consulate
for
life
because
he
had
taken
the
precaution
of
removing
such
members
as
were
most
opposed
to
the
encroachments
of
his
ambition
the
tribunate
resolved
that
a
marked
proof
of
the
national
gratitude
should
be
offered
to
the
first
consul
and
the
resolution
was
transmitted
to
the
senate
not
a
single
voice
was
raised
against
this
proposition
which
emanated
from
chabot
de
the
president
of
the
tribunate
when
the
first
consul
came
back
to
his
cabinet
after
receiving
the
deputation
of
the
tribunate
he
was
very
cheerful
and
said
to
me
bourrienne
it
is
a
blank
cheque
that
the
tribunate
has
just
offered
me
i
shall
know
how
to
fill
it
up
that
is
my
business
the
tribunate
having
adopted
the
indefinite
proposition
of
offering
to
the
first
consul
a
marked
proof
of
the
national
gratitude
it
now
only
remained
to
determine
what
that
proof
should
be
bonaparte
knew
well
what
he
wanted
but
he
did
not
like
to
name
it
in
any
positive
way
though
in
his
fits
of
impatience
caused
by
the
lingering
proceedings
of
the
legislative
body
and
the
indecision
of
some
of
its
members
he
often
talked
of
mounting
on
horseback
and
drawing
his
sword
yet
he
so
far
controlled
himself
as
to
confine
violence
to
his
conversations
with
his
intimate
friends
he
wished
it
to
be
thought
that
he
himself
was
yielding
to
compulsion
that
he
was
far
from
wishing
to
usurp
permanent
power
contrary
to
the
constitution
and
that
if
he
deprived
france
of
liberty
it
was
all
for
her
good
and
out
of
mere
love
for
her
such
duplicity
could
never
have
been
conceived
and
maintained
in
any
common
mind
but
bonaparte
was
not
a
mind
of
the
ordinary
cast
it
must
have
required
extraordinary
to
have
restrained
so
long
as
he
did
that
daring
spirit
which
was
so
natural
to
him
and
which
was
rather
the
result
of
his
temperament
than
his
character
for
my
part
i
confess
that
i
always
admired
him
more
for
what
he
had
the
fortitude
not
to
do
than
for
the
boldest
exploits
he
ever
performed
in
conformity
with
the
usual
form
the
proposition
of
the
tribunate
was
transmitted
to
the
senate
from
that
time
the
senators
on
whom
bonaparte
most
relied
were
frequent
in
their
visits
to
the
tuileries
in
the
preparatory
conferences
which
preceded
the
regular
discussions
in
the
senate
it
has
been
ascertained
that
the
majority
was
not
willing
that
the
marked
proof
of
gratitude
should
be
the
consulate
for
life
it
was
therefore
agreed
that
the
reporter
should
limit
his
demand
to
a
temporary
prolongation
of
the
dignity
of
first
consul
in
favour
of
bonaparte
the
reporter
de
lacepede
acted
accordingly
and
limited
the
prolongation
to
ten
years
commencing
from
the
expiration
of
the
ten
years
granted
by
the
constitution
i
forget
which
of
the
senators
first
proposed
the
consulate
for
life
but
i
well
recollect
that
cambaceres
used
all
his
endeavours
to
induce
those
members
of
the
senate
whom
he
thought
he
could
influence
to
agree
to
that
proposition
whether
from
flattery
or
conviction
i
know
not
but
the
second
consul
held
out
to
his
colleague
or
rather
his
master
the
hope
of
complete
success
bonaparte
on
hearing
him
shook
his
head
with
an
air
of
doubt
but
afterwards
said
to
me
they
will
perhaps
make
some
wry
faces
but
they
must
come
to
it
at
last
it
was
proposed
in
the
senate
that
the
proposition
of
the
consulate
for
life
should
take
the
priority
of
that
of
the
decennial
prolongation
but
this
was
not
agreed
to
and
the
latter
proposition
being
adopted
the
other
of
course
could
not
be
discussed
there
was
something
very
curious
in
the
published
on
the
occasion
it
spoke
in
the
name
of
the
french
people
and
stated
that
in
testimony
of
their
gratitude
to
the
consuls
of
the
republic
the
consular
reign
was
prolonged
for
ten
years
but
that
the
prolongation
was
limited
to
the
first
consul
only
bonaparte
though
much
dissatisfied
with
the
decision
of
the
senate
disguised
his
displeasure
in
ambiguous
language
when
tronchet
then
president
of
the
senate
read
to
him
in
a
solemn
audience
at
the
head
of
the
deputation
the
determining
the
prorogation
he
said
in
reply
that
he
could
not
be
certain
of
the
confidence
of
the
people
unless
his
continuance
in
the
consulship
were
sanctioned
by
their
suffrages
the
interests
of
my
glory
and
happiness
added
he
would
seem
to
have
marked
the
close
of
my
public
life
at
the
moment
when
the
peace
of
the
world
is
proclaimed
but
the
glory
and
the
happiness
of
the
citizen
must
yield
to
the
interests
of
the
state
and
wishes
of
the
public
you
senators
conceive
that
i
owe
to
the
people
another
sacrifice
i
will
make
it
if
the
voice
of
the
people
commands
what
your
suffrage
authorises
the
true
meaning
of
these
words
was
not
understood
by
everybody
and
was
only
manifest
to
those
who
were
initiated
in
the
secret
of
designs
he
did
not
accept
the
offer
of
the
senate
because
he
wished
for
something
more
the
question
was
to
be
renewed
and
to
be
decided
by
the
people
only
and
since
the
people
had
the
right
to
refuse
what
the
senate
offered
they
possessed
for
the
same
reason
the
right
to
give
what
the
senate
did
not
offer
the
moment
now
arrived
for
consulting
the
council
of
state
as
to
the
mode
to
be
adopted
for
invoking
and
collecting
the
suffrages
of
the
people
for
this
purpose
au
extraordinary
meeting
of
the
council
of
state
was
summoned
on
the
of
may
bonaparte
wished
to
keep
himself
aloof
from
all
ostensible
influence
but
his
two
colleagues
laboured
for
him
more
zealously
than
he
could
have
worked
for
himself
and
they
were
warmly
supported
by
several
members
of
the
council
a
strong
majority
were
of
opinion
that
bonaparte
should
not
only
be
invested
with
the
consulship
for
life
but
that
he
should
be
empowered
to
nominate
his
successor
but
he
still
faithful
to
his
plan
affected
to
venerate
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
which
he
held
in
horror
and
he
promulgated
the
following
decree
which
was
the
first
explanation
of
his
reply
to
the
senate
the
consuls
of
the
republic
considering
that
the
resolution
of
the
first
consul
is
an
homage
rendered
to
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
and
that
the
people
when
consulted
on
their
dearest
interests
will
not
go
beyond
the
limits
of
those
interests
decree
as
follows
first
that
the
french
people
shall
be
consulted
on
the
question
whether
napoleon
bonaparte
is
to
be
made
consul
for
life
etc
the
other
articles
merely
regulated
the
mode
of
collecting
the
votes
this
decree
shows
the
policy
of
the
first
consul
in
a
new
point
of
view
and
displays
his
art
in
its
fullest
extent
he
had
just
refused
the
less
for
the
sake
of
getting
the
greater
and
now
he
had
contrived
to
get
the
offer
of
the
greater
to
show
off
his
moderation
by
accepting
only
the
less
the
council
of
state
sanctioned
the
proposition
for
conferring
on
the
first
consul
the
right
of
nominating
his
successor
and
of
his
own
accord
the
first
consul
declined
this
accordingly
the
second
consul
when
he
the
next
day
presented
the
decree
to
the
council
of
state
did
not
fail
to
eulogise
this
extreme
moderation
which
banished
even
the
shadow
of
suspicion
of
any
ambitious
thus
the
senate
found
itself
and
the
decree
of
the
consuls
was
transmitted
at
once
to
the
legislative
body
and
to
the
tribunate
in
the
legislative
body
de
vaublanc
was
distinguished
among
all
the
deputies
who
applauded
the
conduct
of
the
government
and
it
was
he
who
delivered
the
apologetic
harangue
of
the
deputation
of
the
legislative
body
to
the
first
consul
after
having
addressed
the
government
collectively
he
ended
by
addressing
the
first
consul
individually
a
sort
of
compliment
which
had
not
hitherto
been
put
in
practice
and
which
was
far
from
displeasing
him
who
was
its
object
as
de
vaublanc
speech
had
been
communicated
beforehand
to
the
first
consul
the
latter
prepared
a
reply
to
it
which
sufficiently
showed
how
much
it
had
gratified
him
besides
the
flattering
distinction
which
separated
him
from
the
government
the
plenitude
of
praise
was
not
tempered
by
anything
like
advice
or
comment
it
was
not
so
with
the
address
of
the
tribunate
after
the
compliments
which
the
occasion
demanded
a
series
of
hopes
were
expressed
for
the
future
which
formed
a
curious
contrast
with
the
events
which
actually
ensued
the
tribunate
said
the
address
required
no
guarantee
because
bonaparte
elevated
and
generous
sentiments
would
never
permit
him
to
depart
from
those
principles
which
brought
about
the
revolution
and
founded
the
republic
he
loved
real
glory
too
well
ever
to
stain
that
which
he
had
acquired
by
the
abuse
of
power
the
nation
which
he
was
called
to
govern
was
free
and
generous
he
would
respect
and
consolidate
her
liberty
he
would
distinguish
his
real
friends
who
spoke
truth
to
him
from
flatterers
who
might
seek
to
deceive
him
in
short
bonaparte
would
surround
himself
with
the
men
who
having
made
the
revolution
were
interested
in
supporting
it
to
these
and
many
other
fine
things
the
consul
replied
this
testimony
of
the
affection
of
the
tribunate
is
gratifying
to
the
government
the
union
of
all
bodies
of
the
state
is
a
guarantee
of
the
stability
and
happiness
of
the
nation
the
efforts
of
the
government
will
be
constantly
directed
to
the
interests
of
the
people
from
whom
all
power
is
derived
and
whose
welfare
all
good
men
have
at
heart
so
much
for
the
artifice
of
governments
and
the
credulity
of
subjects
it
is
certain
that
from
the
moment
bonaparte
gained
his
point
in
submitting
the
question
of
the
consulate
for
life
to
the
decision
of
the
people
there
was
no
longer
a
doubt
of
the
result
being
in
his
favour
this
was
evident
not
only
on
account
of
the
influential
means
which
a
government
always
has
at
its
command
and
of
which
its
agents
extend
the
ramifications
from
the
centre
to
the
extremities
but
because
the
proposition
was
in
accordance
with
the
wishes
of
the
majority
the
republicans
were
rather
shy
in
avowing
principles
with
which
people
were
now
disenchanted
the
partisans
of
a
monarchy
without
distinction
of
family
saw
their
hopes
almost
realised
in
the
consulate
for
life
the
recollection
of
the
bourbons
still
lived
in
some
hearts
faithful
to
misfortune
but

set
off
to

a

days
at
malmaison
on
the
day
of
our
arrival
as
soon
as
dinner
was
ended
bonaparte
said
to
me
bourrienne
let
us
go
and
take
a
walk
it
was
the
middle
of
may
so
that
the
evenings
were
long
we
went
into
the
park
he
was
very
grave
and
we
walked
for
several
minutes
without
his
uttering
a
syllable
wishing
to
break
silence
in
a
way
that
would
be
agreeable
to
him
i
alluded
to
the
facility
with
which
he
had
nullified
the
last
consulte
he
scarcely
seemed
to
hear
me
so
completely
was
his
mind
absorbed
in
the
subject
on
which
he
was
meditating
at
length
suddenly
recovering
from
his
abstraction
he
said
bourrienne
do
you
think
that
the
pretender
to
the
crown
of
france
would
renounce
his
claims
if
i
were
to
offer
him
a
good
indemnity
or
even
a
province
in
italy
surprised
at
this
abrupt
question
on
a
subject
which
i
was
far
from
thinking
of
i
replied
that
i
did
not
think
the
pretender
would
relinquish
his
claims
that
it
was
very
unlikely
the
bourbons
would
return
to
france
as
long
as
he
bonaparte
should
continue
at
the
head
of
the
government
though
they
would
look
forward
to
their
ultimate
return
as
probable
how
so
inquired
he
for
a
very
simple
reason
general
do
you
not
see
every
day
that
your
agents
conceal
the
truth
from
you
and
flatter
you
in
your
wishes
for
the
purpose
of
ingratiating
themselves
in
your
favour
are
you
not
angry
when
at
length
the
truth
reaches
your
ear
and
what
then
why
general
it
must
be
just
the
same
with
the
agents
of
louis
xviii
in
france
it
is
in
the
course
of
things
in
the
nature
of
man
that
they
should
feed
the
bourbons
with
hopes
of
a
possible
return
were
it
only
to
induce
a
belief
in
their
own
talent
and
utility
that
is
very
true
you
are
quite
right
but
i
am
not
afraid
however
something
might
perhaps
be
done
we
shall
see
here
the
subject
dropped
and
our
conversation
turned
on
the
consulate
for
life
and
bonaparte
spoke
in
unusually
mild
terms
of
the
persons
who
had
opposed
the
proposition
i
was
a
little
surprised
at
this
and
could
not
help
reminding
him
of
the
different
way
in
which
he
had
spoken
of
those
who
opposed
his
accession
to
the
consulate
there
is
nothing
extraordinary
in
that
said
he
worthy
men
may
be
attached
to
the
republic
as
i
have
made
it
it
is
a
mere
question
of
form
i
have
nothing
to
say
against
that
but
at
the
time
of
my
accession
to
the
consulate
it
was
very
different
then
none
but
jacobins
terrorists
and
rogues
resisted
my
endeavours
to
rescue
france
from
the
infamy
into
which
the
directory
had
plunged
her
but
now
i
cherish
no
against
those
who
have
opposed
me
during
the
intervals
between
the
acts
of
the
different
bodies
of
the
state
and
the
collection
of
the
votes
lucien
renewed
his
intrigues
or
rather
prosecuted
them
with
renewed
activity
for
the
purpose
of
getting
the
question
of
hereditary
succession
included
in
the
votes
many
prefects
transmitted
to
chaptal
anonymous
circulars
which
had
been
sent
to
them
all
stated
the
ill
effect
produced
by
these
circulars
which
had
been
addressed
to
the
principal
individuals
of
their
departments
lucien
was
the
originator
of
all
this
though
i
can
not
positively
say
whether
his
brother
connived
with
him
as
in
the
case
of
the
pamphlet
to
which
i
have
already
alluded
i
believe
however
that
bonaparte
was
not
entirely
a
stranger
to
the
business
for
the
circulars
were
written
by
raederer
at
the
instigation
of
lucien
and
raederer
was
at
that
time
in
favour
at
the
tuileries
i
recollect
bonaparte
speaking
to
me
one
day
very
angrily
about
a
pamphlet
which
had
just
been
published
by
camille
jordan
on
the
subject
of
the
national
vote
on
the
consulate
for
life
camille
jordan
did
not
withhold
his
vote
but
gave
it
in
favour
of
the
first
consul
and
instead
of
requiring
preliminary
conditions
he
contented
himself
like
the
tribunate
with
enumerating
all
the
guarantees
which
he
expected
the
honour
of
the
first
consul
would
grant
among
these
guarantees
were
the
cessation
of
arbitrary
imprisonments
the
responsibility
of
the
agents
of
government
and
the
independence
of
the
judges
but
all
these
demands
were
mere
peccadilloes
in
comparison
with
camille
jordan
great
crime
of
demanding
the
liberty
of
the
press
the
first
consul
had
looked
through
the
fatal
pamphlet
and
lavished
invectives
upon
its
author
how
exclaimed
he
am
i
never
to
have
done
with
these
fire
brands
these
babblers
who
think
that
politics
may
be
shown
on
a
printed
page
like
the
world
on
a
map
truly
i
know
not
what
things
will
come
to
if
i
let
this
go
on
camille
jordan
whom
i
received
so
well
at
lyons
to
think
that
he
should
ask
for
the
liberty
of
the
press
were
i
to
accede
to
this
i
might
as
well
pack
up
at
once
and
go
and
live
on
a
farm
a
hundred
leagues
from
paris
bonaparte
first
act
in
favour
of
the
liberty
of
the
press
was
to
order
the
seizure
of
the
pamphlet
in
which
camille
jordan
had
extolled
the
advantages
of
that
measure
publicity
either
by
words
or
writing
was
bonaparte
horror
hence
his
aversion
to
public
speakers
and
writers
camille
jordan
was
not
the
only
person
who
made
unavailing
efforts
to
arrest
bonaparte
in
the
first
steps
of
his
ambition
there
were
yet
in
france
many
men
who
though
they
had
hailed
with
enthusiasm
the
dawn
of
the
french
revolution
had
subsequently
been
disgusted
by
its
crimes
and
who
still
dreamed
of
the
possibility
of
founding
a
truly
constitutional
government
in
france
even
in
the
senate
there
were
some
men
indignant
at
the
usual
compliance
of
that
body
and
who
spoke
of
the
necessity
of
subjecting
the
constitution
to
a
revisal
in
order
to
render
it
conformable
to
the
consulate
for
life
the
project
of
revising
the
constitution
was
by
no
means
unsatisfactory
to
bonaparte
it
afforded
him
an
opportunity
of
holding
out
fresh
glimmerings
of
liberty
to
those
who
were
too
shortsighted
to
see
into
the
future
he
was
pretty
certain
that
there
could
be
no
change
but
to
his
advantage
had
any
one
talked
to
him
of
the
wishes
of
the
nation
he
would
have
replied
citizens
have
voted
of
these
how
many
were
for
me
compare
the
difference
there
is
but
one
vote
in
against
me
i
must
obey
the
will
of
the
people
to
this
he
would
not
have
failed
to
add
whose
are
the
votes
opposed
to
me
those
of
ideologists
jacobins
and
peculators
under
the
directory
to
such
arguments
what
could
have
been
answered
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
i
am
putting
these
words
into
bonaparte
mouth
they
fell
from
him
oftener
than
once
as
soon
as
the
state
of
the
votes
was
ascertained
the
senate
conceived
itself
under
the
necessity
of
repairing
the
only
fault
it
had
committed
in
the
eyes
of
the
first
consul
and
solemnly
presented
him
with
a
new
and
a
decree
couched
in
the
following
terms
article
i
the
french
people
nominate
and
the
senate
proclaim
napoleon
bonaparte
consul
for
life
article
ii
a
statue
representing
peace
holding
in
one
hand
the
laurel
of
victory
and
in
the
other
the
decree
of
the
senate
shall
commemorate
to
posterity
the
gratitude
of
the
nation
article
iii
the
senate
will
convey
to
the
first
consul
the
expression
of
the
confidence
the
love
and
the
admiration
of
the
french
people
bonaparte
replied
to
the
deputation
from
the
senate
in
the
presence
of
the
diplomatic
body
whose
audience
had
been
appointed
for
that
day
in
order
that
the
ambassadors
might
be
enabled
to
make
known
to
their
respective
courts
that
europe
reckoned
one
king
more
in
his
reply
he
did
not
fail
to
introduce
the
words
liberty
and
equality
he
commenced
thus
a
citizen
life
belongs
to
his
country
the
french
people
wish
that
mine
should
be
entirely
devoted
to
their
service
i
obey
on
the
day
this
ceremony
took
place
besides
the
audience
of
the
diplomatic
body
there
was
an
extraordinary
assemblage
of
general
officers
and
public
functionaries
the
principal
apartments
of
the
presented
the
appearance
of
a
fete
this
gaiety
formed
a
striking
contrast
with
the
melancholy
of
josephine
who
felt
that
every
step
of
the
first
consul
towards
the
throne
removed
him
farther
from
her
she
had
to
receive
a
party
that
evening
and
though
greatly
depressed
in
spirits
she
did
the
honours
with
her
usual
grace
let
a
government
be
what
it
may
it
can
never
satisfy
everyone
at
the
establishment
of
the
consulate
for
life
those
who
were
averse
to
that
change
formed
but
a
feeble
minority
but
still
they
met
debated
corresponded
and
dreamed
of
the
possibility
of
overthrowing
the
consular
government
during
the
first
six
months
of
the
year
there
were
meetings
of
the
discontented
which
fouche
who
was
then
minister
of
the
police
knew
and
would
not
condescend
to
notice
but
on
the
contrary
all
the
inferior
agents
of
the
police
contended
for
a
prey
which
was
easily
seized
and
with
the
view
of
magnifying
their
services
represented
these
secret
meetings
as
the
effect
of
a
vast
plot
against
the
government
bonaparte
whenever
he
spoke
to
me
on
the
subject
expressed
himself
weary
of
the
efforts
which
were
made
to
give
importance
to
trifles
and
yet
he
received
the
reports
of
the
police
agents
as
if
he
thought
them
of
consequence
this
was
because
he
thought
fouche
badly
informed
and
he
was
glad
to
find
him
at
fault
but
when
he
sent
for
the
minister
of
police
the
latter
told
him
that
all
the
reports
he
had
received
were
not
worth
a
moment
attention
he
told
the
first
consul
all
and
even
a
great
deal
more
than
had
been
revealed
to
him
mentioning
at
the
same
time
how
and
from
whom
bonaparte
had
received
his
information
but
these
petty
police
details
did
not
divert
the
first
attention
from
the
great
object
he
had
in
view
since
march
he
had
attended
the
sittings
of
the
council
of
state
with
remarkable
regularity
even
while
we
were
at
the
luxembourg
he
busied
himself
in
drawing
up
a
new
code
of
laws
to
supersede
the
incomplete
collection
of
revolutionary
laws
and
to
substitute
order
for
the
sort
of
anarchy
which
prevailed
in
the
legislation
the
man
who
were
most
distinguished
for
legal
knowledge
had
cooperated
in
this
laborious
task
the
result
of
which
was
the
code
first
distinguished
by
the
name
of
the
civil
code
and
afterwards
called
the
code
napoleon
the
labours
of
this
important
undertaking
being
completed
a
committee
was
appointed
for
the
presentation
of
the
code
this
committee
of
which
cambaceres
was
the
president
was
composed
of
mm
portalis
merlin
de
douai
and
tronchet
during
all
the
time
the
discussions
were
pending
instead
of
assembling
as
usual
three
times
a
week
the
council
of
state
assembled
every
day
and
the
sittings
which
on
ordinary
occasions
only
lasted
two
or
three
hours
were
often
prolonged
to
five
or
six
the
first
consul
took
such
interest
in
these
discussions
that
to
have
an
opportunity
of
conversing
upon
them
in
the
evening
he
frequently
invited
several
members
of
the
council
to
dine
with
him
it
was
during
these
conversations
that
i
most
admired
the
inconceivable
versatility
of
bonaparte
genius
or
rather
that
superior
instinct
which
enabled
him
to
comprehend
at
a
glance
and
in
their
proper
point
of
view
legislative
questions
to
which
he
might
have
been
supposed
a
stranger
possessing
as
he
did
in
a
supreme
degree
the
knowledge
of
mankind
ideas
important
to
the
science
of
government
flashed
upon
his
mind
like
sudden
inspirations
some
time
after
his
nomination
to
the
consulate
for
life
anxious
to
perform
a
sovereign
act
he
went
for
the
first
time
to
preside
at
the
senate
availing
myself
that
day
of
a
few
leisure
moments
i
went
out
to
see
the
consular
procession
it
was
truly
royal
the
first
consul
had
given
orders
that
the
military
ranged
in
the
streets
through
which
he
had
to
pass
on
his
first
arrival
at
the
tuileries
napoleon
had
the
soldiers
of
the
guard
ranged
in
a
single
line
in
the
interior
of
the
court
but
he
now
ordered
that
the
line
should
be
doubled
and
should
extend
from
the
gate
of
the
tuileries
to
that
of
the
luxembourg
assuming
a
privilege
which
old
etiquette
had
confined
exclusively
to
the
kings
of
france
bonaparte
now
for
the
first
time
rode
in
a
carriage
drawn
by
eight
horses
a
considerable
number
of
carriages
followed
that
of
the
first
consul
which
was
surrounded
by
generals
and
aides
de
camp
on
horseback
louis
xiv
going
to
hold
a
bed
of
justice
at
the
parliament
of
paris
never
displayed
greater
pomp
than
did
bonaparte
in
this
visit
to
the
senate
he
appeared
in
all
the
parade
of
royalty
and
ten
senators
came
to
meet
him
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
of
the
luxembourg
the
object
of
the
first
consul
visit
to
the
senate
was
the
presentation
of
five
plans
of
the
other
two
consuls
were
present
at
the
ceremony
which
took
place
about
the
middle
of
august
bonaparte
returned
in
the
same
style
in
which
he
went
accompanied
by
lebrun
cambaceres
remaining
at
the
senate
of
which
he
was
president
the
five
were
adopted
but
a
restriction
was
made
in
that
which
concerned
the
forms
of
the
senate
it
was
proposed
that
when
the
consuls
visited
the
senate
they
should
be
received
by
a
deputation
of
ten
members
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
as
the
first
consul
had
that
day
been
received
but
bonaparte
brothers
joseph
and
lucien
opposed
this
and
prevented
the
proposition
from
being
adopted
observing
that
the
second
and
third
consuls
being
members
of
the
senate
could
not
be
received
with
such
honours
by
their
colleagues
this
little
scene
of
political
courtesy
which
was
got
up
beforehand
was
very
well
acted
bonaparte
visit
to
the
senate
gave
rise
to
a
change
of
rank
in
the
hierarchy
of
the
different
authorities
composing
the
government
hitherto
the
council
of
state
had
ranked
higher
in
public
opinion
but
the
senate
on
the
occasion
of
its
late
deputation
to
the
tuileries
had
for
the
first
time
received
the
honour
of
precedency
this
had
greatly
displeased
some
of
the
councillors
of
state
but
bonaparte
did
not
care
for
that
he
instinctively
saw
that
the
senate
would
do
what
he
wished
more
readily
than
the
other
constituted
bodies
and
he
determined
to
augment
its
rights
and
prerogatives
even
at
the
expense
of
the
rights
of
the
legislative
body
these
encroachments
of
one
power
upon
another
authorised
by
the
first
consul
gave
rise
to
reports
of
changes
in
ministerial
arrangements
it
was
rumoured
in
paris
that
the
number
of
the
ministers
was
to
be
reduced
to
three
and
that
lucien
joseph
and
de
talleyrand
were
to
divide
among
them
the
different
portfolios
lucien
helped
to
circulate
these
reports
and
this
increased
the
first
dissatisfaction
at
his
conduct
the
letters
from
madrid
which
were
filled
with
complaints
against
him
together
with
some
scandalous
adventures
known
in
paris
such
as
his
running
away
with
the
wife
of
a
exceedingly
annoyed
bonaparte
who
found
his
own
family
more
difficult
to
govern
than
france
france
indeed
yielded
with
admirable
facility
to
the
yoke
which
the
first
consul
wished
to
impose
on
her
how
artfully
did
he
undo
all
that
the
revolution
had
done
never
neglecting
any
means
of
attaining
his
object
he
loved
to
compare
the
opinions
of
those
whom
he
called
the
jacobins
with
the
opinions
of
the
men
of
and
even
them
he
found
too
liberal
he
felt
the
ridicule
which
was
attached
to
the
mute
character
of
the
legislative
body
which
he
called
his
deaf
and
dumb
assembly
but
as
that
ridicule
was
favourable
to
him
he
took
care
to
preserve
the
assembly
as
it
was
and
to
turn
it
into
ridicule
whenever
he
spoke
of
it
in
general
bonaparte
judgment
must
not
be
confounded
with
his
actions
his
accurate
mind
enabled
him
to
appreciate
all
that
was
good
but
the
necessity
of
his
situation
enabled
him
to
judge
with
equal
shrewdness
what
was
useful
to
himself
what
i
have
just
said
of
the
senate
affords
me
an
opportunity
of
correcting
an
error
which
has
frequently
been
circulated
in
the
of
paris
it
has
erroneously
been
said
of
some
persons
that
they
refused
to
become
members
of
the
senate
and
among
the
number
have
been
mentioned
ducis
de
la
fayette
and
the
marechal
de
rochambeau
the
truth
is
that
no
such
refusals
were
ever
made
the
following
fact
however
may
have
contributed
to
raise
these
reports
and
give
them
credibility
bonaparte
used
frequently
to
say
to
persons
in
his
salon
and
in
his
cabinet
you
should
be
a
senator
a
man
like
you
should
be
a
senator
but
these
complimentary
words
did
not
amount
to
a
nomination
to
enter
the
senate
certain
legal
forms
were
to
be
observed
it
was
necessary
to
be
presented
by
the
senate
and
after
that
presentation
no
one
ever
refused
to
become
a
member
of
the
body
to
which
bonaparte
gave
additional
importance
by
the
creation
of
senatoreries
districts
presided
over
by
a
senator

of

perhaps
one
of
the
happiest
ideas
that
ever
were
expressed
was
that
of
the
athenian
who
said
i
appeal
from
philip

to
philip
sober
the
drunkenness
here
alluded
to
is
not
of
that
kind
which
degrades
a
man
to
the
level
of
a
brute
but
that
intoxication
which
is
occasioned
by
success
and
which
produces
in
the
heads
of
the
ambitious
a
sort
of
cerebral
congestion
ordinary
men
are
not
subject
to
this
excitement
and
can
scarcely
form
an
idea
of
it
but
it
is
nevertheless
true
that
the
fumes
of
glory
and
ambition
occasionally
derange
the
strongest
heads
and
bonaparte
in
all
the
vigour
of
his
genius
was
often
subject
to
aberrations
of
judgment
for
though
his
imagination
never
failed
him
his
judgment
was
frequently
at
fault
this
fact
may
serve
to
explain
and
perhaps
even
to
excuse
the
faults
with
which
the
first
consul
has
been
most
seriously
reproached
the
activity
of
his
mind
seldom
admitted
of
an
interval
between
the
conception
and
the
execution
of
a
design
but
when
he
reflected
coolly
on
the
first
impulses
of
his
imperious
will
his
judgment
discarded
what
was
erroneous
thus
the
blind
obedience
which
like
an
epidemic
disease
infected
almost
all
who
surrounded
bonaparte
was
productive
of
the
most
fatal
effects
the
best
way
to
serve
the
first
consul
was
never
to
listen
to
the
suggestions
of
his
first
ideas
except
on
the
field
of
battle
where
his
conceptions
were
as
happy
as
they
were
rapid
thus
for
example
mm
maret
de
champagny
and
savary
evinced
a
ready
obedience
to
bonaparte
wishes
which
often
proved
very
unfortunate
though
doubtless
dictated
by
the
best
intentions
on
their
part
to
this
fatal
zeal
may
be
attributed
a
great
portion
of
the
mischief
which
bonaparte
committed
when
the
mischief
was
done
and
past
remedy
bonaparte
deeply
regretted
it
how
often
have
i
heard
him
say
that
maret
was
animated
by
an
unlucky
zeal
this
was
the
expression
he
made
use
of
de
talleyrand
was
almost
the
only
one
among
the
ministers
who
did
not
flatter
bonaparte
and
who
really
served
both
the
first
consul
and
the
emperor
when
bonaparte
said
to
de
talleyrand
write
so
and
so
and
send
it
off
by
a
special
courier
that
minister
was
never
in
a
hurry
to
obey
the
order
because
he
knew
the
character
of
the
first
consul
well
enough
to
distinguish
between
what
his
passion
dictated
and
what
his
reason
would
approve
in
short
he
appealed
from
philip
drunk
to
philip
sober
when
it
happened
that
de
talleyrand
suspended
the
execution
of
an
order
bonaparte
never
evinced
the
least
displeasure
when
the
day
after
he
had
received
any
hasty
and
angry
order
de
talleyrand
presented
himself
to
the
first
consul
the
latter
would
say
well
did
you
send
off
the
courier
no
the
minister
would
reply
i
took
care
not
to
do
so
before
i
showed
you
my
letter
then
the
first
consul
would
usually
add
upon
second
thoughts
i
think
it
would
be
best
not
to
send
it
this
was
the
way
to
deal
with
bonaparte
when
de
talleyrand
postponed
sending
off
despatches
or
when
i
myself
have
delayed
the
execution
of
an
order
which
i
knew
had
been
dictated
by
anger
and
had
emanated
neither
from
his
heart
nor
his
understanding
i
have
heard
him
say
a
hundred
times
it
was
right
quite
right
you
understand
me
talleyrand
understands
me
also
this
is
the
way
to
serve
me
the
others
do
not
leave
me
time
for
reflection
they
are
too
precipitate
fouche
also
was
one
of
those
who
did
not
on
all
occasions
blindly
obey
bonaparte
commands
his
other
ministers
on
the
other
hand
when
told
to
send
off
a
courier
the
next
morning
would
have
more
probably
sent
him
off
the
same
evening
this
was
from
zeal
but
was
not
the
first
consul
right
in
saying
that
such
zeal
was
unfortunate
of
talleyrand
and
fouche
in
their
connections
with
the
first
consul
it
might
be
said
that
the
one
represented
the
constituent
assembly
with
a
slight
perfume
of
the
old
regime
and
the
other
the
convention
in
all
its
brutality
bonaparte
regarded
fouche
as
a
complete
personification
of
the
revolution
with
him
therefore
fouche
influence
was
merely
the
influence
of
the
revolution
that
great
event
was
one
of
those
which
had
made
the
most
forcible
impression
on
bonaparte
ardent
mind
and
he
imagined
he
still
beheld
it
in
a
visible
form
as
long
as
fouche
continued
at
the
head
of
his
police
i
am
now
of
opinion
that
bonaparte
was
in
some
degree
misled
as
to
the
value
of
fouche
services
as
a
minister
no
doubt
the
circumstance
of
fouche
being
in
office
conciliated
those
of
the
revolutionary
party
who
were
his
friends
but
fouche
cherished
an
undue
partiality
for
them
because
he
knew
that
it
was
through
them
he
held
his
place
he
was
like
one
of
the
old
condottieri
who
were
made
friends
of
lest
they
should
become
enemies
and
who
owed
all
their
power
to
the
soldiers
enrolled
under
their
banners
such
was
fouche
and
bonaparte
perfectly
understood
his
situation
he
kept
the
chief
in
his
service
until
he
could
find
an
opportunity
of
disbanding
his
undisciplined
followers
but
there
was
one
circumstance
which
confirmed
his
reliance
on
fouche
he
who
had
voted
the
death
of
the
king
of
france
and
had
influenced
the
minds
of
those
who
had
voted
with
him
offered
bonaparte
the
best
guarantee
against
the
attempts
of
the
royalists
for
raising
up
in
favour
of
the
bourbons
the
throne
which
the
first
consul
himself
had
determined
to
ascend
thus
for
different
reasons
bonaparte
and
fouche
had
common
interests
against
the
house
of
bourbon
and
the
master
ambition
derived
encouragement
from
the
supposed
terror
of
the
servant
the
first
consul
was
aware
of
the
existence
in
paris
of
a
royalist
committee
formed
for
the
purpose
of
corresponding
with
louis
xviii
this
committee
consisted
of
men
who
must
not
be
confounded
with
those
wretched
intriguers
who
were
of
no
service
to
their
employers
and
were
not
unfrequently
in
the
pay
of
both
bonaparte
and
the
bourbons
the
royalist
committee
properly
so
called
was
a
very
different
thing
it
consisted
of
men
professing
rational
principles
of
liberty
such
as
the
marquis
de
clermont
gallerande
the
abbe
de
montesqiou
becquet
and
royer
collard
this
committee
had
been
of
long
standing
the
respectable
individuals
whose
names
i
have
just
quoted
acted
upon
a
system
hostile
to
the
despotism
of
bonaparte
and
favourable
to
what
they
conceived
to
be
the
interests
of
france
knowing
the
superior
wisdom
of
louis
and
the
opinions
which
he
had
avowed
and
maintained
in
the
assembly
of
the
notables
they
wished
to
separate
that
prince
from
the
emigrants
and
to
point
him
out
to
the
nation
as
a
suitable
head
of
a
reasonable
constitutional
government
bonaparte
whom
i
have
often
heard
speak
on
the
subject
dreaded
nothing
so
much
as
these
ideas
of
liberty
in
conjunction
with
a
monarchy
he
regarded
them
as
reveries
called
the
members
of
the
committee
idle
dreamers
but
nevertheless
feared
the
triumph
of
their
ideas
he
confessed
to
me
that
it
was
to
counteract
the
possible
influence
of
the
royalist
committee
that
he
showed
himself
so
indulgent
to
those
of
the
emigrants
whose
monarchical
prejudices
he
knew
were
incompatible
with
liberal
opinions
by
the
presence
of
emigrants
who
acknowledged
nothing
short
of
absolute
power
he
thought
he
might
paralyse
the
influence
of
the
royalists
of
the
interior
he
therefore
granted
all
such
emigrants
permission
to
return
about
this
time
i
recollect
having
read
a
document
which
had
been
signed
purporting
to
be
a
declaration
of
the
principles
of
louis
xviii
it
was
signed
by
who
bore
evidence
to
its
authenticity
the
principles
contained
in
the
declaration
were
in
almost
all
points
conformable
to
the
principles
which
formed
the
basis
of
the
charter
even
so
early
as
and
consequently
previous
to
the
fatal
of
january
louis
who
knew
the
opinions
of
de
clermont
gallerande
sent
him
on
a
mission
to
coblentz
to
inform
the
princes
from
him
and
the
queen
that
they
would
be
ruined
by
their
emigration
i
am
accurately
informed
and
i
state
this
fact
with
the
utmost
confidence
i
can
also
add
with
equal
certainty
that
the
circumstance
was
mentioned
by
de
clermont
gallerande
in
his
memoirs
and
that
the
passage
relative
to
his
mission
to
coblentz
was
cancelled
before
the
manuscript
was
sent
to
press
during
the
consular
government
the
object
of
the
royalist
committee
was
to
seduce
rather
than
to
conspire
it
was
round
madame
bonaparte
in
particular
that
their
batteries
were
raised
and
they
did
not
prove
ineffectual
the
female
friends
of
josephine
filled
her
mind
with
ideas
of
the
splendour
and
distinction
she
would
enjoy
if
the
powerful
hand
which
had
chained
the
revolution
should
raise
up
the
subverted
throne
i
must
confess
that
i
was
myself
unconsciously
an
accomplice
of
the
friends
of
the
throne
for
what
they
wished
for
the
interest
of
the
bourbons
i
then
ardently
wished
for
the
interest
of
bonaparte
while
endeavours
were
thus
made
to
gain
over
madame
bonaparte
to
the
interest
of
the
royal
family
brilliant
offers
were
held
out
for
the
purpose
of
dazzling
the
first
consul
it
was
wished
to
retemper
for
him
the
sword
of
the
constable
duguesclin
and
it
was
hoped
that
a
statue
erected
to
his
honour
would
at
once
attest
to
posterity
his
spotless
glory
and
the
gratitude
of
the
bourbons
but
when
these
offers
reached
the
ears
of
bonaparte
he
treated
them
with
indifference
and
placed
no
faith
in
their
sincerity
conversing
on
the
subject
one
day
with
de
la
fayette
he
said
they
offer
me
a
statue
but
i
must
look
to
the
pedestal
they
may
make
it
my
prison
i
did
not
hear
bonaparte
utter
these
words
but
they
were
reported
to
me
from
a
source
the
authenticity
of
which
may
be
relied
on
about
this
time
when
so
much
was
said
in
the
royalist
circles
and
in
the
faubourg
germain
of
which
the
hotel
de
luynes
was
the
headquarters
about
the
possible
return
of
the
bourbons
the
publication
of
a
popular
book
contributed
not
a
little
to
direct
the
attention
of
the
public
to
the
most
brilliant
period
of
the
reign
of
louis
xiv
the
book
was
the
historical
romance
of
madame
de
la
valloire
by
madame
de
genlis
who
had
recently
returned
to
france
bonaparte
read
it
and
i
have
since
understood
that
he
was
very
well
pleased
with
it
but
he
said
nothing
to
me
about
it
it
was
not
until
some
time
after
that
he
complained
of
the
effect
which
was
produced
in
paris
by
this
publication
and
especially
by
engravings
representing
scenes
in
the
life
of
louis
and
which
were
exhibited
in
the
the
police
received
orders
to
suppress
these
prints
and
the
order
was
implicitly
obeyed
but
it
was
not
fouche
police
fouche
saw
the
absurdity
of
interfering
with
trifles
i
recollect
that
immediately
after
the
creation
of
the
legion
of
honour
it
being
summer
the
young
men
of
paris
indulged
in
the
whim
of
wearing
a
carnation
in
a
which
at
a
distance
had
rather
a
deceptive
effect
bonaparte
took
this
very
seriously
he
sent
for
fouche
and
desired
him
to
arrest
those
who
presumed
thus
to
turn
the
new
order
into
ridicule
fouche
merely
replied
that
he
would
wait
till
the
autumn
and
the
first
consul
understood
that
trifles
were
often
rendered
matters
of
importance
by
being
honoured
with
too
much
attention
but
though
bonaparte
was
piqued
at
the
interest
excited
by
the
engravings
of
madame
de
genlis
romance
he
manifested
no
displeasure
against
that
celebrated
woman
who
had
been
recommended
to
him
by
mm
de
fontanes
and
fievee
and
who
addressed
several
letters
to
him
as
this
sort
of
correspondence
did
not
come
within
the
routine
of
my
business
i
did
not
see
the
letters
but
i
heard
from
madame
bonaparte
that
they
contained
a
prodigious
number
of
proper
names
and
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
they
contributed
not
a
little
to
magnify
in
the
eyes
of
the
first
consul
the
importance
of
the
faubourg
germain
which
in
spite
of
all
his
courage
was
a
scarecrow
to
him
bonaparte
regarded
the
faubourg
germain
as
representing
the
whole
mass
of
royalist
opinion
and
he
saw
clearly
that
the
numerous
erasures
from
the
emigrant
list
had
necessarily
increased
dissatisfaction
among
the
royalists
since
the
property
of
the
emigrants
had
not
been
restored
to
its
old
possessors
even
in
those
cases
in
which
it
had
not
been
sold
it
was
the
fashion
in
a
certain
class
to
ridicule
the
unpolished
manners
of
the
great
men
of
the
republic
compared
with
the
manners
of
the
nobility
of
the
old
court
the
wives
of
certain
generals
had
several
times
committed
themselves
by
their
awkwardness
in
many
circles
there
was
an
affectation
of
treating
with
contempt
what
are
called
the
parvenus
those
people
who
to
use
de
talleyrand
expression
do
not
know
how
to
walk
upon
a
carpet
all
this
gave
rise
to
complaints
against
the
faubourg
germain
while
on
the
other
hand
bonaparte
brothers
spared
no
endeavours
to
irritate
him
against
everything
that
was
calculated
to
revive
the
recollection
of
the
bourbons
such
were
bonaparte
feelings
and
such
was
the
state
of
society
during
the
year
the
fear
of
the
bourbons
must
indeed
have
had
a
powerful
influence
on
the
first
consul
before
he
could
have
been
induced
to
take
a
step
which
may
justly
be
regarded
as
the
most
inconsiderate
of
his
whole
life
after
suffering
seven
months
to
elapse
without
answering
the
first
letter
of
louis
after
at
length
answering
his
second
letter
in
the
tone
of
a
king
addressing
a
subject
he
went
so
far
as
to
write
to
louis
proposing
that
he
should
renounce
the
throne
of
his
ancestors
in
his
bonaparte
favour
and
offering
him
as
a
reward
for
this
renunciation
a
principality
in
italy
or
a
considerable
revenue
for
himself
and
his
family
napoleon
seems
to
have
always
known
as
with
cromwell
and
the
stuarts
that
if
his
dynasty
failed
the
bourbons
must
succeed
him
i
remember
says
metternich
napoleon
said
to
me
you
know
why
louis
xviii
is
not
now
sitting
opposite
to
you
it
is
only
because
it
is
i
who
am
sitting
here
no
other
person
could
maintain
his
position
and
if
ever
i
disappear
in
consequence
of
a
catastrophe
no
one
but
a
bourbon
could
sit
here
metternich
tome
farther
he
said
to
metternich
the
king
overthrown
the
republic
was
master
of
the
soil
of
france
it
is
that
which
i
have
replaced
the
old
throne
of
france
is
buried
under
its
rubbish
i
had
to
found
a
new
one
the
bourbons
could
not
reign
over
this
creation
my
strength
lies
in
my
fortune
i
am
new
like
the
empire
there
is
therefore
a
perfect
homogeneity
between
the
empire
and
myself
however
says
metternich
i
have
often
thought
that
napoleon
by
talking
in
this
way
merely
sought
to
study
the
opinion
of
others
or
to
confuse
it
and
the
direct
advance
which
he
made
to
louis
in
seemed
to
confirm
this
suspicion
speaking
to
me
one
day
of
this
advance
he
said
reply
was
grand
it
was
full
of
fine
traditions
there
is
something
in
legitimate
rights
which
appeals
to
more
than
the
mere
mind
if
monsieur
had
consulted
his
mind
only
he
would
have
arranged
with
me
and
i
should
have
made
for
him

of

a
friend
of

brought
to
the
notice
of
napoleon
that
the
tiresome
formalities
insisted
on
by
the
pestilent
clerks
of
all
nations
were
observed
towards
these
regal
personages
gaudin
the
minister
of

apparently
on
his
own
initiative
drew
up
a
decree
increasing

signed

the

compare

the
failure

the
reader
will
recollect
the
curious
question
which
the
first
consul
put
to
me
on
the
subject
of
the
bourbons
when
we
were
walking
in
the
park
of
malmaison
to
the
reply
which
i
made
to
him
on
that
occasion
i
attribute
the
secrecy
he
observed
towards
me
respecting
the
letter
just
alluded
to
i
am
indeed
inclined
to
regard
that
letter
as
the
result
of
one
of
his
private
conferences
with
lucien
but
i
know
nothing
positive
on
the
subject
and
merely
mention
this
as
a
conjecture
however
i
had
an
opportunity
of
ascertaining
the
curious
circumstances
which
took
place
at
mittau
when
bonaparte
letter
was
delivered
to
louis
xviii
that
prince
was
already
much
irritated
against
bonaparte
by
his
delay
in
answering
his
first
letter
and
also
by
the
tenor
of
his
tardy
reply
but
on
reading
the
first
consul
second
letter
the
dethroned
king
immediately
sat
down
and
traced
a
few
lines
forcibly
expressing
his
indignation
at
such
a
proposition
the
note
hastily
written
by
louis
xviii
in
the
first
impulse
of
irritation
bore
little
resemblance
to
the
dignified
and
elegant
letter
which
bonaparte
received
and
which
i
shall
presently
lay
before
the
reader
this
latter
epistle
closed
very
happily
with
the
beautiful
device
of
francis
all
is
lost
but
honour
but
the
first
letter
was
stamped
with
a
more
chivalrous
tone
of
indignation
the
indignant
sovereign
wrote
it
with
his
hand
supported
on
the
hilt
of
his
sword
but
the
abbe
andre
in
whom
louis
xviii
reposed
great
confidence
saw
the
note
and
succeeded
not
without
some
difficulty
in
soothing
the
anger
of
the
king
and
prevailing
on
him
to
write
the
following
letter
i
do
not
confound
bonaparte
with
those
who
have
preceded
him
i
esteem
his
courage
and
his
military
talents
i
am
grateful
for
some
acts
of
his
government
for
the
benefits
which
are
conferred
on
my
people
will
always
be
prized
by
me
but
he
errs
in
supposing
that
he
can
induce
me
to
renounce
my
rights
so
far
from
that
he
would
confirm
them
if
they
could
possibly
be
doubtful
by
the
step
he
has
now
taken
i
am
ignorant
of
the
designs
of
heaven
respecting
me
and
my
subjects
but
i
know
the
obligations
which
god
has
imposed
upon
me
as
a
christian
i
will
fulfil
my
duties
to
my
last
breath
as
the
son
of
louis
i
would
like
him
respect
myself
even
in
chains
as
the
successor
of

louis
xviii
letter
having
reached
paris
the
royalist
committee
assembled
and
were
not
a
little
embarrassed
as
to
what
should
be
done
the
meeting
took
place
at
neuilly
after
a
long
deliberation
it
was
suggested
that
the
delivery
of
the
letter
should
be
entrusted
to
the
third
consul
with
whom
the
abby
de
montesqiou
had
kept
up
acquaintance
since
the
time
of
the
constituent
assembly
this
suggestion
was
adopted
the
recollections
of
the
commencement
of
his
career
under
chancellor
maupeou
had
always
caused
lebrun
to
be
ranked
in
a
distinct
class
by
the
royalists
for
my
part
i
always
looked
upon
him
as
a
very
honest
man
a
warm
advocate
of
equality
and
anxious
that
it
should
be
protected
even
by
despotism
which
suited
the
views
of
the
first
consul
very
well
the
abbe
de
montesquiou
accordingly
waited
upon
lebrun
who
undertook
to
deliver
the
letter
bonaparte
received
it
with
an
air
of
indifference
but
whether
that
indifference
were
real
or
affected
i
am
to
this
day
unable
to
determine
he
said
very
little
to
me
about
the
ill
success
of
the
negotiation
with
louis
xviii
on
this
subject
he
dreaded
above
all
the
interference
of
his
brothers
who
created
around
him
a
sort
of
commotion
which
he
knew
was
not
without
its
influence
and
which
on
several
occasions
had
excited
his
anger
the
letter
of
louis
xviii
is
certainly
conceived
in
a
tone
of
dignity
which
can
not
be
too
highly
admired
and
it
may
be
said
that
bonaparte
on
this
occasion
rendered
a
real
service
to
louis
by
affording
him
the
opportunity
of
presenting
to
the
world
one
of
the
finest
pages
in
the
history
of
a
dethroned
king
this
letter
the
contents
of
which
were
known
in
some
circles
of
paris
was
the
object
of
general
approbation
to
those
who
preserved
the
recollection
of
the
bourbons
and
above
all
to
the
royalist
committee
the
members
of
that
committee
proud
of
the
noble
spirit
evinced
by
the
unfortunate
monarch
whose
return
they
were
generously
labouring
to

replied
to

followed
my
first
disgrace
of
which
i
have
already
spoken
the
day
after
that
on
which
i
had
resumed
my
functions
i
went
as
usual
to
awaken
the
first
consul
at
seven
in
the
morning
he
treated
me
just
the
same
as
if
nothing
had
happened
between
us
and
on
my
part
i
behaved
to
him
just
as
usual
though
i
really
regretted
being
obliged
to
resume
labours
which
i
found
too
oppressive
for
me
when
bonaparte
came
down
into
his
cabinet
he
spoke
to
me
of
his
plans
with
his
usual
confidence
and
i
saw
from
the
number
of
letters
lying
in
the
basket
that
during
the
few
days
my
functions
had
been
suspended
bonaparte
had
not
overcome
his
disinclination
to
peruse
this
kind
of
correspondence
at
the
period
of
this
first
rupture
and
reconciliation
the
question
of
the
consulate
for
life
was
yet
unsettled
it
was
not
decided
until
the
of
august
and
the
circumstances
to
which
i
am
about
to
refer
happened
at
the
end
of
february
i
was
now
restored
to
my
former
footing
of
intimacy
with
the
first
consul
at
least
for
a
time
but
i
soon
perceived
that
after
the
scene
which
de
talleyrand
had
witnessed
my
duties
in
the
tuileries
were
merely
provisional
and
might
be
shortened
or
prolonged
according
to
circumstances
i
saw
at
the
very
first
moment
that
bonaparte
had
sacrificed
his
wounded
pride
to
the
necessity
for
such
i
may
without
any
vanity
call
it
of
employing
my
services
the
forced
preference
he
granted
to
me
arose
from
the
fact
of
his
being
unable
to
find
any
one
able
to
supply
my
place
for
duroc
as
i
have
already
said
showed
a
disinclination
to
the
business
i
did
not
remain
long
in
the
dark
respecting
the
new
situation
in
which
i
stood
i
was
evidently
still
under
quarantine
but
the
period
of
my
quitting
the
port
was
undetermined
a
short
time
after
our
reconciliation
the
first
consul
said
to
me
in
a
cajoling
tone
of
which
i
was
not
the
dupe
my
dear
bourrienne
you
can
not
do
everything
business
increases
and
will
continue
to
increase
you
know
what
corvisart
says
you
have
a
family
therefore
it
is
right
you
should
take
care
of
your
health
you
must
not
kill
yourself
with
work
therefore
some
one
must
be
got
to
assist
you
joseph
tells
me
that
he
can
recommend
a
secretary
one
of
whom
he
speaks
very
highly
he
shall
be
under
your
direction
he
can
make
out
your
copies
and
do
all
that
can
consistently
be
required
of
him
this
i
think
will
be
a
great
relief
to
you
i
ask
for
nothing
better
replied
i
than
to
have
the
assistance
of
some
one
who
after
becoming
acquainted
with
the
business
may
some
time
or
other
succeed
me
joseph
sent
de
meneval
a
young
man
who
to
a
good
education
added
the
recommendations
of
industry
and
prudence
i
had
every
reason
to
be
satisfied
with
him
it
was
now
that
napoleon
employed
all
those
devices
and
caresses
which
always
succeeded
so
well
with
him
and
which
yet
again
gained
the
day
to
put
an
end
to
the
inconvenience
caused
to
him
by
my
retirement
and
to
retain
me
here
i
call
every
one
who
knew
me
as
witnesses
that
nothing
could
equal
my
grief
and
despair
to
find
myself
obliged
to
again
begin
my
troublesome
work
my
health
had
suffered
much
from
it
corvisart
was
a
clever
counsellor
but
it
was
only
during
the
night
that
i
could
carry
out
his
advice
to
resume
my
duties
was
to
renounce
all
hope
of
rest
and
even
of
health
there
is
considerable
truth
in
this
statement
about
the
effect
on
his
health
his
successor
meneval
without
the
same
amount
of
work
broke
down
and
had
to
receive
assistance
meneval
tome
p
i
soon
perceived
the
first
consul
anxiety
to
make
de
meneval
acquainted
with
the
routine
of
business
and
accustomed
to
his
manner
bonaparte
had
never
pardoned
me
for
having
presumed
to
quit
him
after
he
had
attained
so
high
a
degree
of
power
he
was
only
waiting
for
an
opportunity
to
punish
me
and
he
seized
upon
an
unfortunate
circumstance
as
an
excuse
for
that
separation
which
i
had
previously
wished
to
bring
about
i
will
explain
this
circumstance
which
ought
to
have
obtained
for
me
the
consolation
and
assistance
of
the
first
consul
rather
than
the
forfeiture
of
his
favour
my
rupture
with
him
has
been
the
subject
of
various
misstatements
all
of
which
i
shall
not
take
the
trouble
to
correct
i
will
merely
notice
what
i
have
read
in
the
memoirs
of
the
duc
de
rovigo
in
which
it
is
stated
that
i
was
accused
of
peculation
de
rovigo
thus
expresses
himself
ever
since
the
first
consul
was
invested
with
the
supreme
power
his
life
had
been
a
continued
scene
of
personal
exertion
he
had
for
his
private
secretary
de
bourrienne
a
friend
and
companion
of
his
youth
whom
he
now
made
the
sharer
of
all
his
labours
he
frequently
sent
for
him
in
the
dead
of
the
night
and
particularly
insisted
upon
his
attending
him
every
morning
at
seven
bourrienne
was
punctual
in
his
attendance
with
the
public
papers
which
he
had
previously
glanced
over
the
first
consul
almost
invariably
read
their
contents
himself
he
then
despatched
some
business
and
sat
down
to
table
just
as
the
clock
struck
nine
his
breakfast
which
lasted
six
minutes
was
no
sooner
over
than
he
returned
to
his
cabinet
only
left
it
for
dinner
and
resumed
his
close
occupation
immediately
after
until
ten
at
night
which
was
his
usual
hour
for
retiring
to
rest
bourrienne
was
gifted
with
a
most
wonderful
memory
he
could
speak
and
write
many
languages
and
would
make
his
pen
follow
as
fast
as
words
were
uttered
he
possessed
many
other
advantages
he
was
well
acquainted
with
the
administrative
departments
was
versed
in
the
law
of
nations
and
possessed
a
zeal
and
activity
which
rendered
his
services
quite
indispensable
to
the
first
consul
i
have
known
the
several
grounds
upon
which
the
unlimited
confidence
placed
in
him
by
his
chief
rested
but
am
unable
to
speak
with
equal
assurance
of
the
errors
which
occasioned
his
losing
that
confidence
bourrienne
had
many
enemies
some
were
owing
to
his
personal
character
a
greater
number
to
the
situation
which
he
held
others
were
jealous
of
the
credit
he
enjoyed
with
the
head
of
the
government
others
again
discontented
at
his
not
making
that
credit
subservient
to
their
personal
advantage
some
even
imputed
to
him
the
want
of
success
that
had
attended
their
claims
it
was
impossible
to
bring
any
charge
against
him
on
the
score
of
deficiency
of
talent
or
of
indiscreet
conduct
his
personal
habits
were
watched
it
was
ascertained
that
he
engaged
in
financial
speculations
an
imputation
could
easily
be
founded
on
this
circumstance
peculation
was
accordingly
laid
to
his
charge
this
was
touching
the
most
tender
ground
for
the
first
consul
held
nothing
in
greater
abhorrence
than
unlawful
gains
a
solitary
voice
however
would
have
failed
in
an
attempt
to
defame
the
character
of
a
man
for
whom
he
had
so
long
felt
esteem
and
affection
other
voices
therefore
were
brought
to
bear
against
him
whether
the
accusations
were
well
founded
or
otherwise
it
is
beyond
a
doubt
that
all
means
were
resorted
to
for
bringing
them
to
the
knowledge
of
the
first
consul
the
most
effectual
course
that
suggested
itself
was
the
opening
a
correspondence
either
with
the
accused
party
direct
or
with
those
with
whom
it
was
felt
indispensable
to
bring
him
into
contact
this
correspondence
was
carried
on
in
a
mysterious
manner
and
related
to
the
financial
operations
that
had
formed
the
grounds
of
a
charge
against
thus
it
is
that
on
more
than
one
occasion
the
very
channels
intended
for
conveying
truth
to
the
knowledge
of
a
sovereign
have
been
made
available
to
the
purpose
of
communicating
false
intelligence
to
him
to
give
an
instance
under
the
reign
of
louis
and
even
under
the
regency
the
post
office
was
organized
into
a
system
of
minute
inspection
which
did
not
indeed
extend
to
every
letter
but
was
exercised
over
all
such
as
afforded
grounds
for
suspicion
they
were
opened
and
when
it
was
not
deemed
safe
to
suppress
them
copies
were
taken
and
they
were
returned
to
their
proper
channel
without
the
least
delay
any
individual
denouncing
another
may
by
the
help
of
such
an
establishment
give
great
weight
to
his
denunciation
it
is
sufficient
for
his
purpose
that
he
should
throw
into
the
post
office
any
letter
so
worded
as
to
confirm
the
impression
which
it
is
his
object
to
convey
the
worthiest
man
may
thus
be
committed
by
a
letter
which
he
has
never
read
or
the
purport
of
which
is
wholly
unintelligible
to
him
i
am
speaking
from
personal
experience
it
once
happened
that
a
letter
addressed
to
myself
relating
to
an
alleged
fact
which
had
never
occurred
was
opened
a
copy
of
the
letter
so
opened
was
also
forwarded
to
me
as
it
concerned
the
duties
which
i
had
to
perform
at
that
time
but
i
was
already
in
possession
of
the
original
transmitted
through
the
ordinary
channel
summoned
to
reply
to
the
questions
to
which
such
productions
had
given
rise
i
took
that
opportunity
of
pointing
out
the
danger
that
would
accrue
from
placing
a
blind
reliance
upon
intelligence
derived
from
so
hazardous
a
source
accordingly
little
importance
was
afterwards
attached
to
this
means
of
information
but
the
system
was
in
operation
at
the
period
when
de
bourrienne
was
disgraced
his
enemies
took
care
to
avail
themselves
of
it
they
blackened
his
character
with
de
barbe
marbois
who
added
to
their
accusations
all
the
weight
of
his
unblemished
character
the
opinion
entertained
by
this
rigid
public
functionary
and
many
other
circumstances
induced
the
first
consul
to
part
with
his
secretary
tome
peculation
is
the
crime
of
those
who
make
a
fraudulent
use
of
the
public
money
but
as
it
was
not
in
my
power
to
meddle
with
the
public
money
no
part
of
which
passed
through
my
hands
i
am
at
loss
to
conceive
how
i
can
be
charged
with
peculation
the
due
de
rovigo
is
not
the
author
but
merely
the
echo
of
this
calumny
but
the
accusation
to
which
his
memoirs
gave
currency
afforded
de
barbe
marbois
an
opportunity
of
adding
one
more
to
the
many
proofs
he
has
given
of
his
love
of
justice
i
had
seen
nothing
of
the
memoirs
of
the
due
de
rovigo
except
their
announcement
in
the
journals
when
a
letter
from
de
barbe
marbois
was
transmitted
to
me
from
my
family
it
was
as
follows
sir
my
attention
has
been
called
to
the
enclosed
article
in
a
recent
publication
the
assertion
it
contains
is
not
true
and
i
conceive
it
to
be
a
duty
both
to
you
and
myself
to
declare
that
i
then
was
and
still
am
ignorant
of
the
causes
of
the
separation
in
question
i
am
etc
signed
marbois
i
need
say
no
more
in
my
justification
this
unsolicited
testimony
of
de
marbois
is
a
sufficient
contradiction
to
the
charge
of
peculation
which
has
been
raised
against
me
in
the
absence
of
correct
information
respecting
the
real
causes
of
my
rupture
with
the
first
consul
le
due
de
rovigo
also
observes
that
my
enemies
were
numerous
my
concealed
adversaries
were
indeed
all
those
who
were
interested
that
the
sovereign
should
not
have
about
him
as
his
confidential
companion
a
man
devoted
to
his
glory
and
not
to
his
vanity
in
expressing
his
dissatisfaction
with
one
of
his
ministers
bonaparte
had
said
in
the
presence
of
several
individuals
among
whom
was
maret
if
i
could
find
a
second
bourrienne
i
would
get
rid
of
you
all
this
was
sufficient
to
raise
against
me
the
hatred
of
all
who
envied
the
confidence
of
which
i
was
in
possession
the
failure
of
a
firm
in
paris
in
which
i
had
invested
a
considerable
sum
of
money
afforded
an
opportunity
for
envy
and
malignity
to
irritate
the
first
consul
against
me
bonaparte
who
had
not
yet
forgiven
me
for
wishing
to
leave
him
at
length
determined
to
sacrifice
my
services
to
a
new
fit
of
a
mercantile
house
then
one
of
the
most
respectable
in
patna
had
among
its
speculations
undertaken
some
army
contracts
with
the
knowledge
of
berthier
with
whom
indeed
the
house
had
treated
i
had
invested
some
money
in
this
business
unfortunately
the
principals
were
unknown
to
me
engaged
in
dangerous
speculations
in
the
funds
which
in
a
short
time
so
involved
them
as
to
occasion
their
failure
for
a
heavy
amount
this
caused
a
rumour
that
a
slight
fall
of
the
funds
which
took
place
at
that
period
was
occasioned
by
the
bankruptcy
and
the
first
consul
who
never
could
understand
the
nature
of
the
funds
gave
credit
to
the
report
he
was
made
to
believe
that
the
business
of
the
stock
exchange
was
ruined
it
was
insinuated
that
i
was
accused
of
taking
advantage
of
my
situation
to
produce
variations
in
the
funds
though
i
was
so
unfortunate
as
to
lose
not
only
my
investment
in
the
bankrupt
house
but
also
a
sum
of
money
for
which
i
had
become
bound
by
way
of
surety
to
assist
the
house
in
increasing
its
business
i
incurred
the
violent
displeasure
of
the
first
consul
who
declared
to
me
that
he
no
longer
required
my
services
i
might
perhaps
have
cooled
his
irritation
by
reminding
him
that
he
could
not
blame
me
for
purchasing
an
interest
in
a
contract
since
he
himself
had
stipulated
for
a
gratuity
of
francs
for
his
brother
joseph
out
of
the
contract
for
victualling
the
navy
but
i
saw
that
for
some
time
past
de
meneval
had
begun
to
supersede
me
and
the
first
consul
only
wanted
such
an
opportunity
as
this
for
coming
to
a
rupture
with
me
such
is
a
true
statement
of
the
circumstances
which
led
to
my
separation
from
bonaparte
i
defy
any
one
to
adduce
a
single
fact
in
support
of
the
charge
of
peculation
or
any
transaction
of
the
kind
i
fear
no
investigation
of
my
conduct
when
in
the
service
of
bonaparte
i
caused
many
appointments
to
be
made
and
many
names
to
be
erased
from
the
emigrant
list
before
the
of
the
floreal
year
but
i
never
counted
upon
gratitude
experience
having
taught
me
that
it
was
an
empty
word
the
duc
de
rovigo
attributed
my
disgrace
to
certain
intercepted
letters
which
injured
me
in
the
eyes
of
the
first
consul
i
did
not
know
this
at
the
time
and
though
i
was
pretty
well
aware
of
the
machinations
of
bonaparte
adulators
almost
all
of
whom
were
my
enemies
yet
i
did
not
contemplate
such
an
act
of
baseness
but
a
spontaneous
letter
from
de
barbe
marbois
at
length
opened
my
eyes
and
left
little
doubt
on
the
subject
the
following
is
the
postscript
to
that
noble
peer
letter
i
recollect
that
one
wednesday
the
first
consul
while
presiding
at
a
council
of
ministers
at
st
cloud
opened
a
note
and
without
informing
us
what
it
contained
hastily
left
the
board
apparently
much
agitated
in
a
few
minutes
he
returned
and
told
us
that
your
functions
had
ceased
whether
the
sudden
displeasure
of
the
first
consul
was
excited
by
a
false
representation
of
my
concern
in
the
transaction
which
proved
so
unfortunate
to
me
or
whether
bonaparte
merely
made
that
a
pretence
for
carrying
into
execution
a
resolution
which
i
am
convinced
had
been
previously
adopted
i
shall
not
stop
to
determine
but
the
due
de
rovigo
having
mentioned
the
violation
of
the
secrecy
of
letters
in
my
case
i
shall
take
the
opportunity
of
stating
some
particulars
on
that
subject
before
i
wrote
these
memoirs
the
existence
in
the
post
office
of
the
cabinet
which
had
obtained
the
epithet
of
black
had
been
denounced
in
the
chamber
of
deputies
and
the
answer
was
that
it
no
longer
existed
which
of
course
amounted
to
an
admission
that
it
had
existed
i
may
therefore
without
indiscretion
state
what
i
know
respecting
it
the
black
cabinet
was
established
in
the
reign
of
louis
merely
for
the
purpose
of
prying
into
the
scandalous
gossip
of
the
court
and
the
capital
the
existence
of
this
cabinet
soon
became
generally
known
to
every
one
the
numerous
postmasters
who
succeeded
each
other
especially
in
latter
times
the
still
more
numerous
post
office
clerks
and
that
portion
of
the
public
who
are
ever
on
the
watch
for
what
is
held
up
as
scandalous
soon
banished
all
the
secrecy
of
the
affair
and
none
but
fools
were
taken
in
by
it
all
who
did
not
wish
to
be
committed
by
their
correspondence
chose
better
channels
of
communication
than
the
post
but
those
who
wanted
to
ruin
an
enemy
or
benefit
a
friend
long
continued
to
avail
themselves
of
the
black
cabinet
which
at
first
intended
merely
to
amuse
a
monarch
idle
hours
soon
became
a
medium
of
intrigue
dangerous
from
the
abuse
that
might
be
made
of
it
every
morning
for
three
years
i
used
to
peruse
the
portfolio
containing
the
bulletins
of
the
black
cabinet
and
i
frankly
confess
that
i
never
could
discover
any
real
cause
for
the
public
indignation
against
it
except
inasmuch
as
it
proved
the
channel
of
vile
intrigue
out
of
letters
which
daily
left
paris
to
be
distributed
through
france
and
all
parts
of
the
world
ten
or
twelve
at
most
were
copied
and
often
only
a
few
lines
of
them
bonaparte
at
first
proposed
to
send
complete
copies
of
intercepted
letters
to
the
ministers
whom
their
contents
might
concern
but
a
few
observations
from
me
induced
him
to
direct
that
only
the
important
passages
should
be
extracted
and
sent
i
made
these
extracts
and
transmitted
them
to
their
destinations
accompanied
by
the
following
words
the
first
consul
directs
me
to
inform
you
that
he
has
just
received
the
following
information
etc
whence
the
information
came
was
left
to
be
guessed
at
the
first
consul
daily
received
through
this
channel
about
a
dozen
pretended
letters
the
writers
of
which
described
their
enemies
as
opponents
of
the
government
or
their
friends
as
models
of
obedience
and
fidelity
to
the
constituted
authorities
but
the
secret
purpose
of
this
vile
correspondence
was
soon
discovered
and
bonaparte
gave
orders
that
no
more
of
it
should
be
copied
i
however
suffered
from
it
at
the
time
of
my
disgrace
and
was
falling
a
victim
to
it
at
a
subsequent
period
the
letter
mentioned
by
de
marbois
and
which
was
the
occasion
of
this
digression
on
the
violation
of
private
correspondence
derived
importance
from
the
circumstance
that
wednesday
the
of
october
when
bonaparte
received
it
was
the
day
on
which
i
left
the
consular
palace
i
retired
to
a
house
which
bonaparte
had
advised
me
to
purchase
at
st
cloud
and
for
the
fitting
up
and
furnishing
of
which
he
had
promised
to
pay
we
shall
see
how
he
kept
this
promise
i
immediately
sent
to
direct
landoire
the
messenger
of
bonaparte
cabinet
to
place
all
letters
sent
to
me
in
the
first
consul
portfolio
because
many
intended
for
him
came
under
cover
for
me
in
consequence
of
this
message
i
received
the
following
letter
from
de
meneval
my
dear
bourrienne
i
can
not
believe
that
the
first
consul
would
wish
that
your
letters
should
be
presented
to
him
i
presume
you
allude
only
to
those
which
may
concern
him
and
which
come
addressed
under
cover
to
you
the
first
consul
has
written
to
citizens
lavallette
and
mollien
directing
them
to
address
their
packets
to
him
i
can
not
allow
landoire
to
obey
the
order
you
sent
the
first
consul
yesterday
evening
evinced
great
regret
he
repeatedly
said
how
miserable
i
am
i
have
known
that
man
since
he
was
seven
years
old
i
can
not
but
believe
that
he
will
reconsider
his
unfortunate
decision
i
have
intimated
to
him
that
the
burden
of
the
business
is
too
much
for
me
and
that
he
must
be
extremely
at
a
loss
for
the
services
of
one
to
whom
he
was
so
much
accustomed
and
whose
situation
i
am
confident
nobody
else
can
satisfactorily
fill
he
went
to
bed
very
i
am
etc
signed
meneval
vendemiaire
an
x
october
next
day
i
received
another
letter
from
meneval
as
follows
i
send
you
your
letters
the
first
consul
prefers
that
you
should
break
them
open
and
send
here
those
which
are
intended
for
him
i
enclose
some
german
papers
which
he
begs
you
to
translate
madame
bonaparte
is
much
interested
in
your
behalf
and
i
can
assure
you
that
no
one
more
heartily
desires
than
the
first
consul
himself
to
see
you
again
at
your
old
post
for
which
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
a
successor
equal
to
you
either
as
regards
fidelity
or
fitness
i
do
not
relinquish
the
hope
of
seeing
you
here
again
a
whole
week
passed
away
in
conflicts
between
the
first
friendship
and
pride
the
least
desire
he
manifested
to
recall
me
was
opposed
by
his
flatterers
on
the
fifth
day
of
our
separation
he
directed
me
to
come
to
him
he
received
me
with
the
greatest
kindness
and
after
having
told
me
that
i
often
expressed
myself
with
too
much
freedom
a
fault
i
was
never
solicitous
to
correct
he
added
i
regret
your
absence
much
you
were
very
useful
to
me
you
are
neither
too
noble
nor
too
plebeian
neither
too
aristocratic
nor
too
jacobinical
you
are
discreet
and
laborious
you
understand
me
better
than
any
one
else
and
between
ourselves
be
it
said
we
ought
to
consider
this
a
sort
of
court
look
at
duroc
bessieres
maret
however
i
am
very
much
inclined
to
take
you
back
but
by
so
doing
i
should
confirm
the
report
that
i
can
not
do
without
you
madame
bonaparte
informed
me
that
she
had
heard
persons
to
whom
bonaparte
expressed
a
desire
to
recall
me
observe
what
would
you
do
people
will
say
you
can
not
do
without
him
you
have
got
rid
of
him
now
therefore
think
no
more
about
him
and
as
for
the
english
newspapers
he
gave
them
more
importance
than
they
really
deserved
you
will
no
longer
be
troubled
with
them
this
will
bring
to
mind
a
scene
which
occurred
at
malmaison
on
the
receipt
of
some
intelligence
in
the
gazette
i
am
convinced
that
if
bonaparte
had
been
left
to
himself
he
would
have
recalled
me
and
this
conviction
is
warranted
by
the
interval
which
elapsed
between
his
determination
to
part
with
me
and
the
formal
announcement
of
my
dismissal
our
rupture
took
place
on
the
of
october
and
on
the
of
november
following
the
first
consul
sent
me
the
following
letter
citizen
bourrienne
minister
of
state
i
am
satisfied
with
the
services
which
you
have
rendered
me
during
the
time
yon
have
been
with
me
but
henceforth
they
are
no
longer
necessary
i
wish
you
to
relinquish
from
this
time
the
functions
and
title
of
my
private
secretary
i
shall
seize
an
early
opportunity
of
providing
for
you
in
a
way
suited
to
your
activity
and
talents
and
conducive
to
the
public
service
signed
bonaparte
if
any
proof
of
the
first
consul
malignity
were
wanting
it
would
be
furnished
by
the
following
fact
a
few
days
after
the
receipt
of
the
letter
which
announced
my
dismissal
i
received
a
note
from
duroc
but
to
afford
an
idea
of
the
petty
revenge
of
him
who
caused
it
to
be
written
it
will
be
necessary
first
to
relate
a
few
preceding
circumstances
when
with
the
view
of
preserving
a
little
freedom
i
declined
the
offer
of
apartments
which
madame
bonaparte
had
prepared
at
malmaison
for
myself
and
my
family
i
purchased
a
small
house
at
ruel
the
first
consul
had
given
orders
for
the
furnishing
of
this
house
as
well
as
one
which
i
possessed
in
paris
from
the
manner
in
which
the
orders
were
given
i
had
not
the
slightest
doubt
but
that
bonaparte
intended
to
make
me
a
present
of
the
furniture
however
when
i
left
his
service
he
applied
to
have
it
returned
as
at
first
i
paid
no
attention
to
his
demand
as
far
as
it
concerned
the
furniture
at
ruel
he
directed
duroc
to
write
the
following
letter
to
me
the
first
consul
my
dear
bourrienne
has
just
ordered
me
to
send
him
this
evening
the
keys
of
your
residence
in
paris
from
which
the
furniture
is
not
to
be
removed
he
also
directs
me
to
put
into
a
warehouse
whatever
furniture
you
may
have
at
ruel
or
elsewhere
which
you
have
obtained
from
government
i
beg
of
you
to
send
me
an
answer
so
as
to
assist
me
in
the
execution
of
these
orders
you
promised
me
to
have
everything
settled
before
the
first
consul
return
i
must
excuse
myself
in
the
best
way
i
can
signed
duroc
brumaire
an
x
november
believing
myself
to
be
master
of
my
own
actions
i
had
formed
the
design
of
visiting
england
whither
i
was
called
by
some
private
business
however
i
was
fully
aware
of
the
peculiarity
of
my
situation
and
i
was
resolved
to
take
no
step
that
should
in
any
way
justify
a
reproach
on
the
of
january
i
therefore
wrote
to
duroc
my
affairs
require
my
presence
in
england
for
some
time
i
beg
of
you
my
dear
duroc
to
mention
my
intended
journey
to
the
first
consul
as
i
do
not
wish
to
do
anything
inconsistent
with
his
views
i
would
rather
sacrifice
my
own
interest
than
displease
him
i
rely
on
your
friendship
for
an
early
answer
to
this
for
uncertainty
would
be
fatal
to
me
in
many
respects
the
answer
which
speedily
arrived
was
as
follows
my
dear
bourrienne
i
have
presented
to
the
first
consul
the
letter
i
just
received
from
you
he
read
it
and
said
no
that
is
the
only
answer
i
can
give
you
signed
duroc
this
monosyllable
was
expressive
it
proved
to
me
that
bonaparte
was
conscious
how
ill
he
had
treated
me
and
suspecting
that
i
was
actuated
by
the
desire
of
vengeance
he
was
afraid
of
my
going
to
england
lest
i
should
there
take
advantage
of
that
liberty
of
the
press
which
he
had
so
effectually
put
down
in
france
he
probably
imagined
that
my
object
was
to
publish
statements
which
would
more
effectually
have
enlightened
the
public
respecting
his
government
and
designs
than
all
the
scandalous
anecdotes
atrocious
calumnies
and
ridiculous
fabrications
of
pelletier
the
editor
of
the
but
bonaparte
was
much
deceived
in
this
supposition
and
if
there
can
remain
any
doubt
on
that
subject
it
will
be
removed
on
referring
to
the
date
of
these
memoirs
and
observing
the
time
at
which
i
consented
to
publish
them
i
was
not
deceived
as
to
the
reasons
of
bonaparte
unceremonious
refusal
of
my
application
and
as
i
well
knew
his
inquisitorial
character
i
thought
it
prudent
to
conceal
my
notes
i
acted
differently
from
camoens
he
contended
with
the
sea
to
preserve
his
manuscripts
i
made
the
earth
the
depository
of
mine
i
carefully
enclosed
my
most
valuable
notes
and
papers
in
a
tin
box
which
i
buried
under
ground
a
yellow
tinge
the
commencement
of
decay
has
in
some
places
almost
obliterated
the
writing
it
will
be
seen
in
the
sequel
that
my
precaution
was
not
useless
and
that
i
was
right
in
anticipating
the
persecution
of
bonaparte
provoked
by
the
malice
of
my
enemies
on
the
of
april
duroc
sent
me
the
following
note
i
beg
my
dear
bourrienne
that
you
will
come
to
st
cloud
this
morning
i
have
something
to
tell
you
on
the
part
of
the
first
consul
signed
duroc
this
note
caused
me
much
anxiety
i
could
not
doubt
but
that
my
enemies
had
invented
some
new
calumny
but
i
must
say
that
i
did
not
expect
such
baseness
as
i
experienced
as
soon
as
duroc
had
made
me
acquainted
with
the
business
which
the
first
consul
had
directed
him
to
communicate
i
wrote
on
the
spot
the
subjoined
letter
to
bonaparte
at
general
duroc
desire
i
have
this
moment
waited
upon
him
and
he
informs
me
that
you
have
received
notice
that
a
deficit
of
francs
has
been
discovered
in
the
treasury
of
the
navy
which
you
require
me
to
refund
this
day
at
noon
citizen
first
consul
i
know
not
what
this
means
i
am
utterly
ignorant
of
the
matter
i
solemnly
declare
to
you
that
this
charge
is
a
most
infamous
calumny
it
is
one
more
to
be
added
to
the
number
of
those
malicious
charges
which
have
been
invented
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
any
influence
i
might
possess
with
you
i
am
in
general
duroc
apartment
where
i
await
your
orders
duroc
carried
my
note
to
the
first
consul
as
soon
as
it
was
written
he
speedily
returned
all
right
said
he
he
has
directed
me
to
say
it
was
entirely
a
mistake
that
he
is
now
convinced
he
was
deceived
that
he
is
sorry
for
the
business
and
hopes
no
more
will
be
said
about
it
the
base
flatterers
who
surrounded
bonaparte
wished
him
to
renew
his
egyptian
extortions
upon
me
but
they
should
have
recollected
that
the
fusillade
employed
in
egypt
for
the
purpose
of
raising
money
was
no
longer
the
fashion
in
france
and
that
the
days
were

the

consul
never

a

peace
with
england
he
wished
for
peace
merely
because
knowing
it
to
be
ardently
desired
by
the
people
after
ten
years
of
war
he
thought
it
would
increase
his
popularity
and
afford
him
the
opportunity
of
laying
the
foundation
of
his
government
peace
was
as
necessary
to
enable
him
to
conquer
the
throne
of
france
as
war
was
essential
to
secure
it
and
to
enlarge
its
base
at
the
expense
of
the
other
thrones
of
europe
this
was
the
secret
of
the
peace
of
amiens
and
of
the
rupture
which
so
suddenly
followed
though
that
rupture
certainly
took
place
sooner
than
the
first
consul
wished
on
the
great
questions
of
peace
and
war
bonaparte
entertained
elevated
ideas
but
in
discussions
on
the
subject
he
always
declared
himself
in
favour
of
war
when
told
of
the
necessities
of
the
people
of
the
advantages
of
peace
its
influence
on
trade
the
arts
national
industry
and
every
branch
of
public
prosperity
he
did
not
attempt
to
deny
the
argument
indeed
he
concurred
in
it
but
he
remarked
that
all
those
advantages
were
only
conditional
so
long
as
england
was
able
to
throw
the
weight
of
her
navy
into
the
scale
of
the
world
and
to
exercise
the
influence
of
her
gold
in
all
the
cabinets
of
europe
peace
must
be
broken
since
it
was
evident
that
england
was
determined
to
break
it
why
not
anticipate
her
why
allow
her
to
have
all
the
advantages
of
the
first
step
we
must
astonish
europe
we
must
thwart
the
policy
of
the
continent
we
must
strike
a
great
and
unexpected
blow
thus
reasoned
the
first
consul
and
every
one
may
judge
whether
his
actions
agreed
with
his
sentiments
the
conduct
of
england
too
well
justified
the
foresight
of
policy
or
rather
england
by
neglecting
to
execute
her
treaties
played
into
bonaparte
hand
favoured
his
love
for
war
and
justified
the
prompt
declaration
of
hostilities
in
the
eyes
of
the
french
nation
whom
he
wished
to
persuade
that
if
peace
were
broken
it
would
be
against
his
wishes
england
was
already
at
work
with
the
powerful
machinery
of
her
subsidies
and
the
veil
beneath
which
she
attempted
to
conceal
her
negotiations
was
still
sufficiently
transparent
for
the
lynx
eye
of
the
first
consul
it
was
in
the
midst
of
peace
that
all
those
plots
were
hatched
while
millions
who
had
no
knowledge
of
their
existence
were
securely
looking
forward
to
uninterrupted
repose
since
the
revolution
paris
had
never
presented
such
a
spectacle
as
during
the
winter
of
at
that
time
the
concourse
of
foreigners
in
the
french
capital
was
immense
everything
wore
the
appearance
of
satisfaction
and
the
external
signs
of
public
prosperity
the
visible
regeneration
in
french
society
exceedingly
annoyed
the
british
ministry
the
english
who
flocked
to
the
continent
discovered
france
to
be
very
different
from
what
she
was
described
to
be
by
the
english
papers
this
caused
serious
alarm
on
the
other
side
of
the
channel
and
the
english
government
endeavoured
by
unjust
complaints
to
divert
attention
from
just
dissatisfaction
which
its
own
secret
intrigues
excited
the
king
of
england
sent
a
message
to
parliament
in
which
he
spoke
of
armaments
preparing
in
the
ports
of
france
and
of
the
necessity
of
adopting
precautions
against
meditated
aggressions
this
instance
of
bad
faith
highly
irritated
the
first
consul
who
one
day
in
a
fit
of
displeasure
thus
addressed
lord
whitworth
in
the
salon
where
all
the
foreign
ambassadors
were
assembled
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
are
you
then
tired
of
peace
must
europe
again
be
deluged
with
blood
preparations
for
war
indeed
do
you
think
to
overawe
us
by
this
you
shall
see
that
france
may
be
conquered
perhaps
destroyed
but
never
intimidated
never
the
english
ambassador
was
astounded
at
this
unexpected
sally
to
which
he
made
no
reply
he
contented
himself
with
writing
to
his
government
an
account
of
an
interview
in
which
the
first
consul
had
so
far
forgotten
himself
purposely
or
not
i
do
not
pretend
to
say
that
england
wished
for
war
there
could
be
no
doubt
she
occupied
malta
it
is
true
but
she
had
promised
to
give
it
up
though
she
never
had
any
intention
of
doing
so
she
was
to
have
evacuated
egypt
yet
there
she
still
remained
the
cape
of
good
hope
was
to
have
been
surrendered
but
she
still
retained
possession
of
it
england
had
signed
at
amiens
a
peace
which
she
had
no
intention
of
maintaining
she
knew
the
hatred
of
the
cabinets
of
europe
towards
france
and
she
was
sure
by
her
intrigues
and
subsidies
of
arming
them
on
her
side
whenever
her
plans
reached
maturity
she
saw
france
powerful
and
influential
in
europe
and
she
knew
the
ambitious
views
of
the
first
consul
who
indeed
had
taken
little
pains
to
conceal
them
the
first
consul
who
had
reckoned
on
a
longer
duration
of
the
peace
of
amiens
found
himself
at
the
rupture
of
the
treaty
in
an
embarrassing
situation
the
numerous
grants
of
furloughs
the
deplorable
condition
of
the
cavalry
and
the
temporary
absence
of
artillery
in
consequence
of
a
project
for
refounding
all
the
caused
much
anxiety
to
bonaparte
he
had
recourse
to
the
conscription
to
fill
up
the
deficiencies
of
the
army
and
the
project
of
refounding
the
artillery
was
abandoned
supplies
of
money
were
obtained
from
the
large
towns
and
hanover
which
was
soon
after
occupied
furnished
abundance
of
good
horses
for
mounting
the
cavalry
war
had
now
become
inevitable
and
as
soon
as
it
was
declared
the
first
consul
set
out
to
visit
belgium
and
the
seaboard
departments
to
ascertain
the
best
means
of
resisting
the
anticipated
attacks
of
the
english
in
passing
through
compiegne
he
received
a
visit
from
father
berton
formerly
principal
of
the
military
school
of
brienne
he
was
then
rector
of
the
school
of
arts
at
compiegne
a
situation
in
which
he
had
been
placed
by
bonaparte
i
learned
the
particulars
of
this
visit
through
josephine
father
berton
whose
primitive
simplicity
of
manner
was
unchanged
since
the
time
when
he
held
us
under
the
authority
of
his
ferule
came
to
invite
bonaparte
and
josephine
to
breakfast
with
him
which
invitation
was
accepted
father
berton
had
at
that
time
living
with
him
one
of
our
old
comrades
of
brienne
named
bouquet
but
he
expressly
forbade
him
to
show
himself
to
bonaparte
or
any
one
of
his
suite
because
bouquet
who
had
been
a
commissary
at
headquarters
in
italy
was
in
disgrace
with
the
first
consul
bouquet
promised
to
observe
father
berton
injunctions
but
was
far
from
keeping
his
promise
as
soon
as
he
saw
bonaparte
carriage
drive
up
he
ran
to
the
door
and
gallantly
handed
out
josephine
josephine
as
she
took
his
hand
said
bouquet
you
have
ruined
yourself
bonaparte
indignant
at
what
he
considered
an
unwarrantable
familiarity
gave
way
to
one
of
his
uncontrollable
fits
of
passion
and
as
soon
as
he
entered
the
room
where
the
breakfast
was
laid
he
seated
himself
and
then
said
to
his
wife
in
an
imperious
tone
josephine
sit
there
he
then
commenced
breakfast
without
telling
father
becton
to
sit
down
although
a
third
plate
had
been
laid
for
him
father
becton
stood
behind
his
old
chair
apparently
confounded
at
his
violence
the
scene
produced
such
an
effect
on
the
old
man
that
he
became
incapable
of
discharging
his
duties
at
compiegne
he
retired
to
rheims
and
his
intellect
soon
after
became
deranged
i
do
not
pretend
to
say
whether
this
alienation
of
mind
was
caused
by
the
occurrence
i
have
just
related
and
the
account
of
which
i
received
from
josephine
she
was
deeply
afflicted
at
what
had
passed
father
berton
died
insane
what
i
heard
from
josephine
was
afterwards
confirmed
by
the
brother
of
father
becton
the
fact
is
that
in
proportion
as
bonaparte
acquired
power
he
was
the
more
annoyed
at
the
familiarity
of
old
companions
and
indeed
i
must
confess
that
their
familiarity
often
appeared
very
ridiculous
the
first
consul
visit
to
the
northern
coast
took
place
towards
the
end
of
the
year
at
which
time
the
english
attacked
the
dutch
settlements
of
surinam

essequibo
and
a

of
neutrality
was
concluded
between
france
spain
and

rapp
accompanied
the
first
consul
who
attentively
inspected
the
preparations
making
for
a
descent
on
england
which
it
was
never
his
intention
to
effect
as
will
be
shortly
shown
on
the
first
consul
return
i
learned
from
rapp
that
i
had
been
spoken
of
during
the
journey
and
in
the
following
way
bonaparte
being
at
boulogne
wanted
some
information
which
no
one
there
could
give
him
vexed
at
receiving
no
satisfactory
answer
to
his
inquiries
he
called
rapp
and
said
do
you
know
rapp
where
bourrienne
is
general
he
is
in
paris
write
to
him
to
come
here
immediately
and
send
off
one
of
my
couriers
with
the
letter
the
rumour
of
the
first
consul
sudden
recollection
of
me
spread
like
lightning
and
the
time
required
to
write
the
letter
and
despatch
the
courier
was
more
than
sufficient
for
the
efforts
of
those
whom
my
return
was
calculated
to
alarm
artful
representations
soon
checked
these
spontaneous
symptoms
of
a
return
to
former
feelings
and
habits
when
rapp
carried
to
the
first
consul
the
letter
he
had
been
directed
to
write
the
order
was
countermanded
however
rapp
advised
me
not
to
leave
paris
or
if
i
did
to
mention
the
place
where
i
might
be
found
so
that
duroc
might
have
it
in
his
power
to
seize
on
any
favourable
circumstance
without
delay
i
was
well
aware
of
the
friendship
of
both
rapp
and
duroc
and
they
could
as
confidently
rely

bonaparte
was
as
i
have
mentioned
quite
unprepared
in
most
branches
of
the
service
yet
everything
was
created
as
if
by
magic
and
he
seemed
to
impart
to
others
a
share
of
his
own
incredible
activity
it
is
inconceivable
how
many
things
had
been
undertaken
and
executed
since
the
rupture
of
the
peace
the
north
coast
of
france
presented
the
appearance
of
one
vast
arsenal
for
bonaparte
on
this
occasion
employed
his
troops
like
roman
soldiers
and
made
the
tools
of
the
artisan
succeed
to
the
arms
of
the
warrior
on
his
frequent
journeys
to
the
coast
bonaparte
usually
set
off
at
night
and
on
the
following
morning
arrived
at
the
post
office
of
chantilly
where
he
breakfasted
rapp
whom
i
often
saw
when
he
was
in
paris
talked
incessantly
of
these
journeys
for
he
almost
always
accompanied
the
first
consul
and
it
would
have
been
well
had
he
always
been
surrounded
by
such
men
in
the
evening
the
first
consul
supped
at
abbeville
and
arrived
early
next
day
at
the
bridge
of
brique
it
would
require
constitutions
of
iron
to
go
through
what
we
do
said
rapp
we
no
sooner
alight
from
the
carriage
than
we
mount
on
horseback
and
sometimes
remain
in
our
saddles
for
ten
or
twelve
hours
successively
the
first
consul
inspects
and
examines
everything
often
talks
with
the
soldiers
how
he
is
beloved
by
them
when
shall
we
pay
a
visit
to
london
with
those
brave
fellows
notwithstanding
these
continual
journeys
the
first
consul
never
neglected
any
of
the
business
of
government
and
was
frequently
present
at
the
deliberations
of
the
council
i
was
still
with
him
when
the
question
as
to
the
manner
in
which
the
treaties
of
peace
should
be
concluded
came
under
the
consideration
of
the
council
some
members
among
whom
truguet
was
conspicuous
were
of
opinion
that
conformably
with
an
article
of
the
constitution
the
treaties
should
be
proposed
by
the
head
of
the
government
submitted
to
the
legislative
body
and
after
being
agreed
to
promulgated
as
part
of
the
laws
bonaparte
thought
differently
i
was
entirely
of
his
opinion
and
he
said
to
me
it
is
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
opposition
that
they
appeal
to
the
constitution
for
if
the
constitution
says
so
it
is
absurd
there
are
some
things
which
can
not
become
the
subject
of
discussion
in
a
public
assembly
for
instance
if
i
treat
with
austria
and
my
ambassador
agrees
to
certain
conditions
can
those
conditions
be
rejected
by
the
legislative
body
it
is
a
monstrous
absurdity
things
would
be
brought
to
a
fine
pass
in
this
way
lucchesini
and
markow
would
give
dinners
every
day
like
cambaceres
scatter
their
money
about
buy
men
who
are
to
be
sold
and
thus
cause
our
propositions
to
be
rejected
this
would
be
a
fine
way
to
manage
matters
when
bonaparte
according
to
his
custom
talked
to
me
in
the
evening
of
what
had
passed
in
the
council
his
language
was
always
composed
of
a
singular
mixture
of
quotations
from
antiquity
historical
references
and
his
own
ideas
he
talked
about
the
romans
and
i
remember
when
fox
was
at
paris
that
he
tried
to
distinguish
himself
before
that
foreign
minister
whom
he
greatly
esteemed
in
his
enlarged
way
of
viewing
the
world
bonaparte
divided
it
into
two
large
states
the
east
and
the
west
what
matters
he
would
often
say
that
two
countries
are
separated
by
rivers
or
mountains
that
they
speak
different
languages
with
very
slight
shades
of
variety
france
spain
england
italy
and
germany
have
the
same
manners
and
customs
the
same
religion
and
the
same
dress
in
them
a
man
can
only
marry
one
wife
slavery
is
not
allowed
and
these
are
the
great
distinctions
which
divide
the
civilised
inhabitants
of
the
globe
with
the
exception
of
turkey
europe
is
merely
a
province
of
the
world
and
our
warfare
is
but
civil
strife
there
is
also
another
way
of
dividing
nations
namely
by
land
and
water
then
he
would
touch
on
all
the
european
interests
speak
of
russia
whose
alliance
he
wished
for
and
of
england
the
mistress
of
the
seas
he
usually
ended
by
alluding
to
what
was
then
his
favourite
scheme
an
expedition
to
india
when
from
these
general
topics
bonaparte
descended
to
the
particular
interests
of
france
he
still
spoke
like
a
sovereign
and
i
may
truly
say
that
he
showed
himself
more
jealous
than
any
sovereign
ever
was
of
the
dignity
of
france
of
which
he
already
considered
himself
the
sole
representative
having
learned
that
a
captain
of
the
english
navy
had
visited
the
dockyard
of
brest
passing
himself
off
as
a
merchant
whose
passport
he
had
borrowed
he
flew
into
a
rage
because
no
one
had
ventured
to
arrest
see
james
naval
history
for
an
account
of
sir
sidney
smith
daring
exploit
nothing
was
lost
on
bonaparte
and
he
made
use
of
this
fact
to
prove
to
the
council
of
state
the
necessity
of
increasing
the
number
of
of
police
at
a
meeting
of
the
council
he
said
if
there
had
been
a
commissary
of
police
at
brest
he
would
have
arrested
the
english
captain
and
sent
him
at
once
to
paris
as
he
was
acting
the
part
of
a
spy
i
would
have
had
him
shot
as
such
no
englishman
not
even
a
nobleman
or
the
english
ambassador
should
be
admitted
into
our
dockyards
i
will
soon
regulate
all
this
he
afterwards
said
to
me
there
are
plenty
of
wretches
who
are
selling
me
every
day
to
the
english
without
my
being
subjected
to
english
spying
during
the
short
and
hollow
peace
of
amiens
bonaparte
sent
over
to
england
as
consuls
and
a
number
of
engineers
and
military
men
who
were
instructed
to
make
plans
of
all
the
harbours
and
coasts
of
the
united
kingdom
they
worked
in
secrecy
yet
not
so
secretly
but
that
they
were
soon
suspected
the
facts
were
proved
and
they
were
sent
out
of
the
country
without
editor
of
edition
he
had
on
one
occasion
said
before
an
assemblage
of
generals
senators
and
high
officers
of
state
who
were
at
an
audience
of
the
diplomatic
body
the
english
think
that
i
am
afraid
of
war
but
i
am
not
and
here
the
truth
escaped
him
in
spite
of
himself
my
power
will
lose
nothing
by
war
in
a
very
short
time
i
can
have
of
men
at
my
disposal
what
has
been
the
result
of
the
first
war
the
union
of
belgium
and
piedmont
to
france
this
is
greatly
to
our
advantage
it
will
consolidate
our
system
france
shall
not
be
restrained
by
foreign
fetters
england
has
manifestly
violated
the
treaties
it
would
be
better
to
render
homage
to
the
king
of
england
and
crown
him
king
of
france
at
paris
than
to
submit
to
the
insolent
caprices
of
the
english
government
if
for
the
sake
of
preserving
peace
at
most
for
only
two
months
longer
i
should
yield
on
a
single
point
the
english
would
become
the
more
treacherous
and
insolent
and
would
enact
the
more
in
proportion
as
we
yield
but
they
little
know
me
were
we
to
yield
to
england
now
she
would
next
prohibit
our
navigation
in
certain
parts
of
the
world
she
would
insist
on
the
surrender
of
par
ships
i
know
not
what
she
would
not
demand
but
i
am
not
the
man
to
brook
such
indignities
since
england
wishes
for
war
she
shall
have
it
and
that
speedily
on
the
same
day
bonaparte
said
a
great
deal
more
about
the
treachery
of
england
the
gross
calumnies
to
which
he
was
exposed
in
the
london
newspapers
powerfully
contributed
to
increase
his
natural
hatred
of
the
liberty
of
the
press
and
he
was
much
astonished
that
such
attacks
could
be
made
upon
him
by
english
subjects
when
he
was
at
peace
with
the
english
government
i
had
one
day
a
singular
proof
of
the
importance
which
bonaparte
attached
to
the
opinion
of
the
english
people
respecting
any
misconduct
that
was
attributed
to
him
what
i
am
about
to
state
will
afford
another
example
of
bonaparte
disposition
to
employ
petty
and
roundabout
means
to
gain
his
ends
he
gave
a
ball
at
malmaison
when
hortense
was
in
the
seventh
month
of
her
pregnancy
this
refers
to
the
first
son
of
louis
and
of
hortense
napoleon
charles
the
intended
successor
of
napoleon
who
was
born
died
elder
brother
of
napoleon
iii
i
have
already
mentioned
that
he
disliked
to
see
women
in
that
situation
and
above
all
could
not
endure
to
see
them
dance
yet
in
spite
of
this
antipathy
he
himself
asked
hortense
to
dance
at
the
ball
at
malmaison
she
at
first
declined
but
bonaparte
was
exceedingly
importunate
and
said
to
her
in
a
tone
of
persuasion
do
i
beg
of
you
i
particularly
wish
to
see
you
dance
come
stand
up
to
oblige
me
hortense
at
last
consented
the
motive
for
this
extraordinary
request
i
will
now
explain
on
the
day
after
the
ball
one
of
the
newspapers
contained
some
verses
on
hortense
dancing
she
was
exceedingly
annoyed
at
this
and
when
the
paper
arrived
at
malmaison
she
expressed
displeasure
at
it
even
allowing
for
all
the
facility
of
our
newspaper
wits
she
was
nevertheless
at
a
loss
to
understand
how
the
lines
could
have
been
written
and
printed
respecting
a
circumstance
which
only
occurred
the
night
before
bonaparte
smiled
and
gave
her
no
distinct
answer
when
hortense
knew
that
i
was
alone
in
the
cabinet
she
came
in
and
asked
me
to
explain
the
matter
and
seeing
no
reason
to
conceal
the
truth
i
told
her
that
the
lines
had
been
written
by
bonaparte
direction
before
the
ball
took
place
i
added
what
indeed
was
the
fact
that
the
ball
had
been
prepared
for
the
verses
and
that
it
was
only
for
the
appropriateness
of
their
application
that
the
first
consul
had
pressed
her
to
dance
he
adopted
this
strange
contrivance
for
contradicting
an
article
which
appeared
in
an
english
journal
announcing
that
hortense
was
delivered
bonaparte
was
highly
indignant
at
that
premature
announcement
which
he
clearly
saw
was
made
for
the
sole
purpose
of
giving
credit
to
the
scandalous
rumours
of
his
imputed
connection
with
hortense
such
were
the
petty
machinations
which
not
unfrequently
found
their
place
in
a
mind
in
which
the
grandest
schemes
were
revolving

in
making
it
be
supposed
that
he
really
possessed

of
interfering
with
trifles

him
more
for
what
he
had
the
fortitude
not
to
do
animated
by
an
unlucky
zeal
ideologues
put
some
gold
lace
on
the
