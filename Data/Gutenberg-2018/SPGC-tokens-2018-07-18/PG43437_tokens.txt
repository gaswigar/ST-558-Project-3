the

introduction
i
was
invited
to
pass
a
month
last
summer
in
buckinghamshire
by
a
friend
who
paid
annually
a
visit
to
his
mother
a
lady
pretty
far
advanced
in
years
but
extremely
chearful
sensible
and
she
lived
altogether
in
the
country
in
a
good
old
fashioned
house
which
was
part
of
her
jointure
and
it
was
to
this
hospitable
mansion
he
carried
me
the
lady
received
me
very
politely
as
her
son
friend
and
i
have
great
reason
to
be
obliged
to
him
for
the
introduction
my
friend
and
i
generally
dedicated
our
evenings
to
the
entertainment
of
this
obliging
lady
she
loved
reading
and
was
a
woman
of
an
excellent
taste
but
as
her
years
rendered
that
employment
not
so
easy
to
her
as
it
had
been
her
son
and
myself
usually
spared
her
the
task
and
read
to
her
such
authors
as
she
chose
for
her
entertainment
nor
was
she
so
confined
to
particular
studies
as
not
to
allow
us
to
vary
our
subjects
as
inclination
led
us
it
happened
one
evening
which
was
on
the
eve
of
the
day
appointed
for
our
departure
that
we
had
made
choice
of
the
tragedy
of
douglas
for
our
entertainment
when
a
neighbouring
lady
a
sensible
woman
who
had
drank
tea
with
us
desired
to
make
one
of
our
auditors
after
the
was
removed
we
entered
on
our
task
my
friend
and
i
reading
alternately
to
relieve
each
other
that
we
might
not
injure
the
performance
by
a
wearied
or
flat
delivery
neither
of
the
ladies
had
ever
seen
or
read
this
play
before
and
both
gave
that
true
testimony
of
nature
to
its
merit
tears
when
we
had
finished
the
reading
of
it
they
each
in
her
turn
bestowed
high
praises
on
it
but
the
visitor
lady
said
that
notwithstanding
the
pleasure
it
had
afforded
her
upon
the
whole
she
had
one
great
objection
to
it
we
were
all
impatient
to
know
what
it
was
i
think
said
she
that
the
moral
which
it
inculcates
is
a
discouraging
lesson
especially
to
youth
for
the
blooming
hero
of
this
story
though
adorned
with
the
highest
virtues
of
humanity
truth
modesty
gratitude
filial
piety
nobleness
of
mind
and
valour
in
the
most
eminent
degree
is
not
only
buried
in
obscurity
by
a
severe
destiny
till
he
arrives
at
manhood
but
when
he
emerges
into
light
is
suddenly
cut
off
by
an
untimely
death
and
that
at
a
juncture
too
when
we
might
morally
speaking
say
his
virtues
to
have
been
rewarded
we
each
spoke
our
thoughts
on
the
subject
as
opinion
led
us
when
the
old
lady
drew
our
attention
which
she
always
does
whenever
she
delivers
her
sentiments
i
should
think
as
you
do
madam
said
she
if
there
were
not
too
many
melancholy
precedents
to
give
a
sanction
to
the
fable
of
that
tragedy
i
do
not
say
but
that
the
poet
who
is
at
liberty
to
dispose
as
he
pleases
of
the
works
of
his
own
creation
may
as
well
reward
and
punish
according
to
the
measures
of
justice
in
this
life
it
might
perhaps
make
a
better
impression
and
indeed
afford
a
more
prevalent
example
to
the
generality
of
young
people
i
say
therefore
i
do
not
take
upon
me
to
defend
an
opposite
conduct
upon
principles
of
poetic
justice
but
surely
the
poet
who
prefers
that
course
may
be
justified
in
it
from
every
day
experience
if
we
always
saw
virtuous
people
successful
in
their
pursuits
and
their
days
crowned
with
prosperity
there
would
be
more
force
in
your
objection
but
the
direct
contrary
is
a
truth
which
every
body
who
has
lived
but
a
moderate
number
of
years
must
have
been
convinced
of
from
their
own
observation
amongst
heathens
indeed
who
looked
no
farther
than
life
for
good
and
evil
and
whose
only
incitement
to
virtue
was
the
praise
of
men
or
what
called
glory
such
morals
might
be
dangerous
but
surely
amongst
us
christians
they
at
least
not
to
have
any
ill
effect
on
the
contrary
i
think
it
should
serve
to
confirm
that
great
lesson
which
we
are
all
taught
indeed
but
which
we
seldom
think
of
reducing
to
practice
to
use
the
good
things
of
this
life
with
that
indifference
which
things
that
are
neither
permanent
in
their
own
nature
nor
of
any
estimation
in
the
fight
of
god
deserve
on
the
other
hand
to
consider
the
evils
which
befall
us
as
equally
temporary
and
no
more
dispensed
by
the
great
ruler
of
all
things
for
punishments
than
the
others
are
for
rewards
and
by
thus
estimating
both
to
look
forward
for
an
equal
distribution
of
justice
to
that
place
only
where
let
our
station
be
what
it
will
our
lot
is
to
be
unchangeable
it
is
in
this
light
that
i
was
instructed
in
my
early
days
to
consider
the
various
portions
that
fall
to
the
share
of
mankind
which
very
often
as
far
as
we
can
see
appear
extremely
partial
and
no
doubt
would
really
be
so
were
there
not
an
invisible
world
where
the
distributions
are
just
and
equal
from
this
reflection
i
have
drawn
comfort
in
many
trying
incidents
of
my
life
but
in
none
more
than
the
unhappy
fate
of
a
lady
who
was
my
particular
friend
and
who
tho
a
woman
of
most
exemplary
virtue
was
thro
the
course
of
her
whole
life
persecuted
by
a
variety
of
strange
misfortunes
this
lady
to
use
your
expression
madam
addressing
her
friend
to
all
human
appearance
at
last
to
have
been
rewarded
even
here
but
her
portion
was
affliction
what
then
are
we
to
conclude
but
that
god
does
not
estimate
things
as
we
do
it
is
ignorant
as
well
as
sinful
to
arraign
his
providence
we
daily
see
its
dispensations
with
our
own
eyes
in
the
various
accidents
of
life
why
should
we
not
then
allow
the
poet
to
copy
from
life
and
exhibit
to
our
view
events
the
probability
of
which
are
founded
on
general
experience
we
are
indeed
so
much
used
to
what
they
call
poetical
justice
that
we
are
disappointed
in
the
catastrophe
of
a
fable
if
every
body
concerned
in
it
be
not
disposed
of
according
to
the
sentence
of
that
judge
which
we
have
set
up
in
our
own
breasts
the
contrary
we
know
happens
in
real
life
let
us
not
then
condemn
what
is
drawn
from
real
we
may
wish
to
see
nature
copied
from
her
more
pleasing
works
but
a
martyr
expiring
in
tortures
is
as
just
though
not
as
agreeable
a
representation
of
her
as
a
hero
rewarded
with
the
brightest
honours
we
agreed
with
the
venerable
lady
in
her
observations
and
her
son
taking
occasion
from
her
mentioning
that
unfortunate
person
who
was
her
friend
told
her
he
would
take
it
as
a
particular
favour
if
she
would
oblige
me
with
the
sight
of
that
lady
story
she
answered
that
as
we
had
fixed
up
the
next
day
for
our
departure
there
would
not
be
time
for
me
to
peruse
it
but
that
she
would
entrust
me
with
it
to
take
it
to
town
that
i
might
read
it
at
my
leisure
it
is
drawn
up
said
she
for
the
most
part
by
the
lady
herself
and
the
occasion
of
its
being
so
was
this
she
and
i
had
been
intimate
from
our
childhood
we
were
when
young
and
constant
companions
as
we
grew
up
we
always
called
each
other
sister
and
loved
as
well
as
if
we
had
really
borne
that
relationship
to
each
other
it
was
our
continual
practice
from
children
to
keep
little
journals
of
what
daily
happened
to
us
these
in
all
our
short
absences
were
matter
of
great
entertainment
to
us
we
constantly
communicated
them
when
we
met
or
if
we
chanced
to
be
separated
by
any
distance
we
made
a
mutual
exchange
by
the
post
of
our
little
diurnal
registers
having
made
each
a
solemn
promise
not
to
conceal
an
incident
or
even
a
thought
of
the
least
moment
from
the
other
and
this
promise
i
believe
was
religiously
kept
up
during
a
correspondence
of
many
years
i
had
a
brother
about
three
years
older
than
myself
a
very
promising
young
man
he
was
an
only
son
and
the
darling
of
his
parents
when
he
had
finished
his
studies
my
father
thought
of
sending
him
abroad
but
his
fondness
for
him
made
him
resolve
to
accompany
him
himself
a
better
tutor
or
a
better
guide
he
could
not
have
found
for
him
my
father
was
then
in
the
prime
of
life
he
had
no
other
children
but
him
and
me
my
mother
as
fond
of
me
as
he
was
of
his
son
and
perfectly
affectionate
to
my
father
expressed
her
wish
to
let
both
her
and
me
be
of
his
party
she
said
she
thought
a
young
lady
under
proper
conduct
might
improve
as
much
by
seeing
foreign
courts
and
the
various
customs
of
different
nations
as
a
young
gentleman
i
was
then
about
sixteen
my
father
readily
consented
as
he
perfectly
loved
my
mother
and
we
all
four
set
out
on
our
tour
together
it
was
my
lot
after
i
had
been
some
time
abroad
to
marry
an
english
gentleman
then
resident
at
vienna
this
occasioned
my
continuing
there
some
years
and
it
was
during
that
space
of
time
that
i
had
the
occurrences
of
my
friend
life
from
her
own
hand
as
she
had
kept
up
to
the
method
we
had
agreed
on
of
communicating
every
thing
that
happened
even
to
trivial
matters
it
generally
encreased
the
bulk
of
the
packets
i
used
to
receive
from
her
to
a
prodigious
size
these
she
sent
off
occasionally
at
nearer
or
more
distant
periods
of
time
according
as
i
gave
her
the
opportunity
by
letting
her
know
our
motions
i
have
from
those
selected
the
most
material
parts
of
her
history
and
connected
them
so
as
to
make
one
continued
narrative
there
were
long
intervals
of
time
between
many
of
the
most
important
incidents
of
her
life
but
as
the
passages
which
intervened
were
either
foreign
to
the
main
scope
of
her
story
or
too
trivial
to
be
recorded
in
copying
her
papers
they
were
omitted
i
have
myself
prefixed
to
her
story
a
very
brief
account
of
the
family
thus
much
sir
added
the
good
lady
i
thought
necessary
to
premise
to
you
for
your
better
understanding
her
history
which
i
have
never
yet
shewn
to
any
body
but
my
son
when
i
took
my
leave
she
put
the
manuscript
into
my
hands
with
a
charge
to
be
careful
of
it
we
returned
to
town
and
in
less
than
three
weeks
i
had
the
mortification
to
hear
that
this
respectable
old
lady
by
whom
i
had
been
entertained
with
so
much
friendship
and
politeness
was
dead
her
son
my
friend
was
on
this
occasion
obliged
to
go
down
into
buckinghamshire
it
was
some
months
before
i
saw
him
again
as
he
had
a
good
deal
of
family
business
to
settle
when
he
came
back
to
london
i
offered
to
return
him
the
manuscript
which
he
had
quite
forgot
he
told
me
as
he
had
all
the
original
papers
copy
was
at
my
service
i
then
expressed
my
wish
that
it
were
made
public
to
this
he
at
first
objected
as
he
said
there
were
several
persons
living
related
to
the
parties
concerned
in
some
of
the
principal
events
of
the
story
who
might
take
umbrage
at
it
i
told
him
that
this
might
easily
be
obviated
by
changing
the
names
both
of
persons
and
places
which
i
would
undertake
to
do
throughout
the
whole
and
i
was
afterwards
so
urgent
with
him
to
comply
with
my
request
that
he
at
last
yielded
with
his
consent
therefore
i
give
it
to
the
world
just
as
i
received
it
without
any
alteration
excepting
the
proposed
one
of
a
change
of
names
memoirs
of
miss
sidney
bidulph
mrs
catharine
sidney
bidulph
was
the
daughter
of
sir
robert
bidulph
of
wiltshire
her
father
died
when
she
was
very
young
and
of
ten
children
none
survived
him
but
this
lady
and
his
eldest
son
afterwards
sir
george
bidulph
the
family
estate
was
not
very
considerable
and
miss
bidulph
portion
was
but
four
thousand
pounds
a
fortune
however
at
that
time
but
quite
contemptible
it
was
in
the
beginning
of
queen
reign
lady
bidulph
was
a
woman
of
plain
sense
but
exemplary
piety
the
strictness
of
her
notions
highly
commendable
in
themselves
now
and
then
gave
a
tincture
of
severity
to
her
actions
though
she
was
ever
esteemed
a
truly
good
woman
she
had
educated
her
daughter
who
was
one
of
the
greatest
beauties
of
her
time
in
the
strictest
principles
of
virtue
from
which
she
never
deviated
through
the
course
of
an
innocent
though
unhappy
life
sir
george
bidulph
was
nine
or
ten
years
older
than
his
sister
he
was
a
man
of
a
good
understanding
moral
as
to
his
general
conduct
but
void
of
any
of
those
refined
sentiments
which
constitute
what
is
called
pride
is
sometimes
accounted
laudable
that
which
sir
george
possessed
for
he
had
pride
was
not
of
this
kind
he
was
of
a
weakly

and
had
been
ordered
by
the
physicians
to
spa
for
the
recovery
of
a
lingering
disorder
which
he
had
laboured
under
for
some
time
it
was
just
on
his
return
to
england
that
the
busy
scene
of
his
sister
life
opened
an
intimate
friend

hers

own
sex

she
revealed

secrets
of
her
heart

at
this
juncture
to
go
abroad
and
it
was
for
her
perusal
only
the
following
journal
was
intended
that
friend
has
carefully
preserved
it
as
she
thinks
it
may
serve
for
an
example
to
prove
that
neither
prudence
foresight
nor
even
the
best
disposition
that
the
human
heart
is
capable
of
are
of
themselves
sufficient
to
defend
us
against
the
inevitable
ills

sometimes
are
allotted

swift
nor
the
battle

the
strong
the
journal
my
dear
and
cecilia
is
now
on
her
way
to
harwich
how
insipid
will
this
task
of
recording
all
the
little
incidents
of
the
day
now
appear
to
me
when
you
my
sister
friend
of
my
heart
are
no
longer
near
me
how
many
tedious
months
will
it
be
before
i
again
embrace
you
how
many
days
of
impatience
must
i
suffer
before
i
can
even
hear
from
you
or
communicate
to
you
the
actions
the
words
the
thoughts
of
your
sidney
but
let
me
not
grow
plaintive
the
stile
my
friend
hates

should
be
ungrateful
if
i
indulged
it
to
the
best
of
mothers
who
to
gratify
and
amuse
me
on

i

experienced
has
been

quit

retirement

come
on

to
london
to
rouze
up
my
spirits

expresses
herself

complainings
let
me
rest
assured
that
my
cecilia

happy
in
her
pursuits

let
me
resolve
on

myself
so
in
mind
we
have
had
a
letter
from
my
brother
george
he
is
landed
and
we
expect
him
hourly
in
town
as
our
house
is
large
enough
i
hope
he
will
consent
to
take
up
his
quarters
with
us
while
we
stay
in
london
my
mother
intends
to
request
it
of
him
she
says
it
will
be
for
the
of
a
gay
young
man
to
live
in
a
family
i
know
not
how
sir
george
may
relish
the
proposal
as
our
hours
are
not
likely
to
correspond
with
those
which
i
suppose
he
has
been
used
to
since
he
has
been
absent
from
us
but
perhaps
he
may
not
refuse
the
compliment
sir
george
is
not
averse
to
how
kind
how
indulgent
is
this
worthy
parent
of
mine
she
will
not
suffer
me
to
stay
at
home
with
her
nay
scarce
allows
me
time
for
my
journal
i
wo
have
you
stay
within
i
wo
have
you
write
i
wo
have
you
think
i
will
make
a
rake
of
you
you
shall
go
to
the
play
and
i
am
almost
tempted
to
go
with
you
myself
though
i
have
not
been
at
one
since
your
death
these
were
her
kind
expressions
to
me
just
i
am
indeed
indebted
to
her
tenderness
when
she
relaxes
so
much
of
her
usual
strictness
as
even
to
of
such
a
thing
my
brother
returned
to
us
this
day
thank
god
in
perfect
health
never
was
there
such
an
alteration
seen
in
a
man
he
is
grown
fat
and
looks
quite
robust
he
dropped
in
upon
us
just
as
we
sat
down
to
dinner
what
a
clutter
has
his
arrival
made
my
mother
was
rejoyced
and
thankful
and
full
of
praises
and
asked
many
questions
that
george
could
hardly
find
words
enough
to
answer
the
of
her
kind
inquisitiveness
which
lasted
all
when
the
cloth
was
removed
my
mother
proposed
his
taking
up
his
abode
with
us
you
see
said
she
your
sister
and
i
have
got
here
into
a
large
house
there
is
full
room
enough
in
it
for
you
and
your
servants
and
as
i
think
in
such
a
town
as
this
it
will
be
a
reputable
place
for
you
to
live
in
i
shall
be
glad
of
your
company
provided
you
do
not
encroach
upon
my
rules
by
unreasonable
hours
or
receiving
visits
from
such
as
i
may
not
approve
of
for
the
acquaintance
of
your
sister
i
was
afraid
sir
george
would
disrelish
the
terms
as
perhaps
some
of
his
acquaintance
though
far
from
faulty
ones
might
fall
within
my
mother
predicament
but
i
was
mistaken
he
accepted
of
the
invitation
after
making
some
slight
apologies
about
the
inconvenience
of
having
so
many
servants
this
however
was
soon
got
over
to
say
the
truth
i
am
very
glad
that
my
brother
has
consented
to
be
our
guest
as
i
hope
by
his
means
our
circle
of
acquaintance
will
be
a
good
deal
enlarged
there
is
no
pleasure
in
society
without
a
proper
mixture
of
sensible
people
of
both
sexes
and
i
have
hitherto
been
chiefly
confined
to
those
of
my
own
i
asked
sir
george
jocosely
what
he
had
brought
me
home
he
answered
perhaps
a
good
my
mother
catched
up
the
word
what
do
you
mean
son
i
mean
madam
that
there
is
come
over
with
me
a
gentleman
with
whom
i
became
acquainted
in
germany
who
of
all
the
men
i
ever
knew
i
should
wish
to
have
for
a
brother
if
sidney
should
fortunately
be
born
under
the
influence
of
good
stars
it
may
happen
to
be
brought
about
i
can
tell
you
applying
himself
to
me
he
is
prepossessed
in
your
favour
already
i
have
shewn
him
some
of
your
letters
and
he
thinks
you
a
good
sensible
girl
i
told
him
you
were
very
well
in
your
person
and
that
you
have
had
an
excellent
education
i
hope
so
said
my
mother
looking
pleased
and
what
have
you
to
tell
us
of
this
wonderful
man
that
so
much
surpasses
every
body
why
madam
for
part
of
his
character
he
is
the
best
young
man
i
ever
saw
i
never
knew
any
body
equal
to
him
for
sobriety
nor
so
intirely
free
from
all
the
other
vices
of
youth
as
i
lived
in
the
same
house
with
him
for
some
months
i
had
frequent
opportunities
of
making
my
observations
i
have
known
him
to
many
irregularities
but
never
saw
him
guilty
of
an
admirable
character
indeed
said
my
mother
so
thought
i
too
but
i
wanted
to
know
a
little
more
of
him
now
sidney
for
your
share
in
the
description
i
must
tell
you
he
is
most
exquisitely
handsome
and
extremely
sensible
good
sense
to
be
sure
is
requisite
said
my
mother
but
as
for
beauty
it
is
but
a
fading
flower
at
best
and
in
a
man
not
at
all
necessary
a
man
is
not
the
worse
for
it
however
cried
my
brother
no
my
mother
answered
provided
it
does
not
make
him
vain
and
too
fond
of
the
admiration
of
giddy
girls
that
i
will
be
sworn
is
not
the
case
of
my
friend
answered
sir
george
i
believe
no
body
with
such
a
person
as
his
if
there
be
such
another
would
be
so
little
vain
of
it
nay
i
have
heard
him
declare
that
even
in
a
woman
he
would
give
the
preference
to
sense
and
virtue
good
young
man
cried
my
mother
i
should
like
to
be
acquainted
with
him
so
should
i
whispered
i
to
my
own
heart
well
brother
said
i
you
have
drawn
a
good
picture
but
to
make
it
complete
you
must
throw
in
generosity
valour
sweetness
of
temper
and
a
great
deal
of
money
fie
my
dear
said
my
good
parent
a
is
not
necessary
a
very
moderate
fortune
with
a
man
is
sufficient
the
good
qualities
you
require
in
the
finishing
of
my
piece
answered
my
brother
he
possesses
in
an
eminent
degree
will
that
satisfy
you
as
for
his
fortune
perhaps
a
difficulty
may
step
in
what
estate
madam
to
my
mother
do
you
think
my
sister
fortune
may
intitle
her
to
dear
brother
i
cried
pray
do
not
speak
in
that
way
my
mother
answered
him
very
gravely
your
father
you
know
left
her
but
four
thousand
pounds
it
is
in
my
power
to
add
a
to
it
if
she
marries
to
please
me
great
matters
we
have
no
right
to
expect
but
a
good
girl
as
my
daughter
is
i
think
deserves
something
more
than
a
bare
equivalent
the
equality
said
my
brother
with
a
demure
look
i
fear
is
out
of
all
proportion
here
for
the
gentleman
i
speak
of
has
but
six
thousand
pounds
a
year
he
burst
out
a
laughing
it
was
not
and
i
was
vexed
at
his
joke
my
poor
mother
dropped
her
countenance
i
looked
silly
as
if
i
had
been
disappointed
but
i
said
nothing
then
he
is
above
our
reach
sidney
answered
my
mother
i
made
no
reply
have
a
good
heart
sid
cried
my
brother
if
my
nonpareil
likes
you
when
he
sees
you
i
felt
myself
hurt
and
grow
red
and
without
a
compliment
sister
seeing
me
look
mortified
i
think
he
will
fortune
will
be
no
objection
i
have
already
told
him
the
utmost
extent
of
your
expectations
he
would
hardly
let
me
mention
the
subject
he
has
a
mind
for
sister
and
if
he
finds
her
personal
accomplishments
answer
a
brother
perhaps
partial
description
it
will
be
your
own
fault
if
you
have
not
the
prettiest
fellow
in
england
for
your
husband
my
mother
reassumed
her
pleased
countenance
where
is
he
let
us
see
him
i
forced
a
smile
though
i
did
not
feel
myself
quite
satisfied
we
parted
on
the
road
my
brother
answered
he
is
gone
to
bath
for
a
few
weeks
he
has
sent
his
servants
and
his
baggage
to
town
before
him
and
has
commissioned
me
to
take
a
house
for
him
in
james
square
or
some
of
the
adjacent
streets
so
that
we
shall
have
him
in
our
neighbourhood
my
mother
enquired
on
what
account
he
went
to
bath
sir
george
said
he
complained
of
a
weakness
in
one
of
his
wrists
which
was
the
consequence
of
a
fever
that
had
seized
him
on
his
journey
in
their
return
to
england
it
seems
he
had
finished
his
travels
on
which
he
had
been
absent
near
five
years
when
my
brother
and
he
met
in
germany
the
liking
he
took
to
sir
george
protracted
his
stay
and
he
resolved
not
to
quit
him
while
his
health
obliged
him
to
continue
abroad
they
took
a
trip
to
paris
together
and
returned
home
by
holland
the
name
of
this
piece
of
perfection
is
faulkland
orlando
faulkland
what
a
pretty
name
orlando
is
my
mother
says
it
is
romantic
and
wonders
how
people
can
give
their
children
such
names
now
am
i
dying
with
curiosity
to
see
this
man
a
few
weeks
at
bath
what
business
he
had
to
go
to
bath
till
he
had
first
settled
his
household
at
london
his
wrist
might
have
grown
well
without
the
pump
i
am
afraid
he
is
gone
to
bath
only
to
shew
himself
and
that
he
will
be
snapped
up
before
he
comes
to
town
i
wish
sir
george
had
kept
the
account
of
him
to
himself
till
he
returned
to
london
again
we
have
settled
sir
george
oeconomy
within
doors
my
mother
has
been
very
busy
all
day
in
fixing
trunks
portmanteaus
and
boxes
in
their
proper
places
and
in
appropriating
the
rooms
for
his
men
which
she
has
taken
care
shall
be
as
remote
from
those
of
our
servants
as
the
house
will
admit
she
says
she
knows
our
own
domestics
to
be
orderly
and
regular
but
she
can
not
answer
for
what
other
people
may
be
i
begin
to
recover
my
spirits
my
brother
arrival
has
given
new
life
to
the
family
my
mother
thinks
that
in
company
with
a
lady
or
two
there
will
be
no
impropriety
in
suffering
me
to
go
at
least
half
a
dozen
times
into
public
during
the
season
even
without
the
sanction
of
her
presence
how
kind
how
considerate
is
this
dear
mother
i
find
this
was
one
amongst
others
of
her
principal
reasons
for
wishing
sir
george
to
be
with
us
as
it
will
save
her
from
the
necessity
of
going
to
public
diversions
which
otherwise
she
would
have
done
rather
than
have
me
debarred
the
pleasure
of
partaking
of
them
through
the
want
of
a
proper
protector
every
day
lays
me
under
fresh
obligations
to
her
my
brother
has
had
another
letter
from
mr
faulkland
he
has
been
but
a
fortnight
at
bath
and
already
has
found
benefit
from
the
use
of
the
pump
i
wish
his
wrist
was
quite
well
i
never
was
so
impatient
to
see
any
body
but
sidney
have
a
care
this
heart
has
never
yet
been
touch
this
man
is
represented
as
a
dangerous
object
what
an
an
girl
should
i
be
if
i
should
fall
in
love
with
him
and
he
should
happen
not
to
like
me
should
what
a
vain
expression
was
that
i
would
not
for
the
world
any
one
should
see
it
but
my
well
if
he
should
not
like
me
what
then
why
i
will
not
like
him
i
have
a
heart
not
very
susceptible
of
what
we
young
women
call
love
and
in
all
likelihood
i
shall
be
as
indifferent
to
him
as
he
may
be
to
me
indeed
i
think
i
ought
to
resolve
on
not
liking
him
for
notwithstanding
those
fine
of
a
character
which
my
brother
gave
of
him
in
the
presence
of
my
mother
i
have
since
drawn
out
of
sir
george
who
is
always
talking
of
him
some
farther
particulars
which
do
not
please
me
so
well
for
i
think
he
is
made
up
of
contrarieties
nature
says
sir
george
never
formed
a
temper
so
gentle
so
humane
so
benevolent
as
his
yet
when
provoked
no
tempest
is
more
furious
you
would
imagine
him
so
humble
that
he
thinks
every
one
superior
to
himself
yet
through
this
disguise
have
i
discovered
at
certain
times
a
pride
which
makes
him
look
down
on
all
mankind
with
a
disposition
formed
to
relish
and
a
heart
attached
to
the
domestic
pleasures
of
life
he
is
of
so
enterprising
a
temper
that
dangers
and
difficulties
rather
encourage
than
dishearten
him
in
the
pursuit
of
a
favourite
point
his
ideas
of
love
honour
generosity
and
gratitude
are
so
refined
that
no
hero
in
romance
ever
went
beyond
him
of
this
i
was
convinced
from
many
little
incidents
which
occurred
in
the
course
of
my
acquaintance
with
him
the
modesty
and
affability
of
his
deportment
makes
every
body
fancy
when
he
is
in
company
with
them
that
he
is
delighted
with
their
conversation
nay
he
often
affects
to
be
improved
and
informed
yet
there
is
a
sly
turn
to
ridicule
in
him
which
though
without
the
least
tincture
of
makes
him
see
and
represent
things
in
a
light
the
very
opposite
of
that
in
which
you
fansied
he
saw
them
with
the
nicest
discernment
where
he
permits
his
judgment
alone
to
determine
let
passion
interfere
and
a
child
can
impose
on
him
though
as
i
have
already
told
you
he
is
very
handsome
he
affects
to
despise
beauty
in
his
own
sex
yet
is
it
easy
to
perceive
by
the
nice
care
he
takes
in
his
dress
though
the
farthest
in
the
world
from
a
fop
that
he
does
not
altogether
disregard
it
in
his
own
person
are
not
these
faults
yes
surely
they
are
yet
sir
george
protests
he
has
none
or
at
least
says
if
these
be
such
they
are
so
overbalanced
by
his
good
qualities
that
unless
it
be
sister
flattering
creature
though
that
is
seldom
his
failing
i
do
know
the
woman
that
deserves
him
i
did
not
thank
him
for
the
compliment
he
paid
me
at
the
expense
of
the
rest
of
our
poor
sex
a
month
is
past
since
my
brother
arrived
and
mr
faulkland
does
not
yet
talk
of
coming
to
town
if
sir
george
had
drawn
half
such
a
flattering
picture
of
me
to
him
as
he
has
done
of
him
to
me
his
curiosity
would
have
brought
him
here
my
mother
has
mentioned
him
several
times
and
asked
when
he
is
to
be
in
town
my
brother
has
taken
a
very
handsome
house
for
him
in
the
square
we
are
all
in
expectation
of
this
blazing
star
making
its
appearance
in
london
if
he
stays
much
longer
my
patience
will
be
so
tired
that
i
shall
not
give
a
pinch
of
snuff
to
see
him
six
weeks
and
no
news
of
mr
faulkland
coming
i
positively
give
him
but
another
week
i
begin
to
think
myself
affronted
by
his
stay
now
now
my
cecilia
i
can
gratify
your
curiosity
at
full
he
is
come
at
last
mr
faulkland
i
mean
orlando
is
come
we
had
a
message
from
him
this
morning
to
enquire
after
all
our
healths
he
was
just
arrived
at
his
house
in
the
square
sir
george
flew
to
him
directly
and
said
he
would
bring
him
without
ceremony
to
take
a
family
dinner
my
mother
bid
him
do
so
and
she
held
a
quarter
of
an
hour
conference
with
her
cook
she
is
always
elegant
and
exact
at
her
table
but
we
were
more
than
ordinarily
so
my
brother
brought
mr
faulkland
a
little
before
and
presented
him
to
my
mother
and
me
with
that
kind
of
freedom
that
almost
look
as
if
he
were
already
one
of
the
family
we
had
both
been
prepossessed
highly
in
favour
of
his
figure
a
circumstance
that
seldom
is
of
advantage
to
persons
on
their
first
appearance
but
here
it
had
not
that
effect
sir
george
did
not
overrate
the
personal
accomplishments
of
his
friend
now
you
expect
i
should
describe
him
to
you
perhaps
and
paint
this
romantic
hero
in
the
glowing
colours
of
romantic
exageration
but
i
disappoint
you
and
tell
you
that
he
is
neither
like
an
adonis
nor
an
apollo
that
he
has
no
hyacinthine
curls
flowing
down
his
back
no
eyes
like
suns
whose
brightness
and
majesty
strike
the
beholders
dumb
nor
in
short
no
rays
of
divinity
about
him
yet
he
is
the
handsomest
mortal
man
that
i
ever
i
will
not
say
that
his
voice
is
harmony
itself
and
that
all
the
loves
and
graces
for
why
should
not
there
be
male
as
well
as
female
graces
attend
on
his
motions
that
minerva
presides
over
his
lips
and
every
feature
has
its
attendant
cupid
but
i
will
acknowlege
that
his
voice
in
speaking
is
inexpressibly
pleasing
you
know
how
i
admire
an
agreeable
voice
that
his
air
and
motions
are
easy
genteel
and
graceful
his
conversation
sensible
and
polite
and
without
the
least
tincture
of
affection
that
thing
which
of
all
others
would
to
destroy
the
charms
of
an
in
short
without
hyperbole
that
he
is
what
every
one
must
allow
a
perfectly
handsome
and
accomplished
young
man
i
never
saw
my
mother
appear
so
pleased
with
any
one
the
polite
freedom
of
his
address
the
attention
and
deference
he
seemed
to
pay
to
her
sentiments
and
the
dear
good
woman
talked
more
to
him
i
think
than
ever
i
heard
her
do
to
any
one
on
so
short
an
acquaintance
delighted
her
beyond
expression
i
bore
no
great
part
in
the
conversation
but
was
not
however
quite
overlooked
by
mr
faulkland
he
referred
to
me
in
discourse
now
and
then
and
seemed
pleased
with
me
at
least
i
so
my
brother
endeavoured
to
draw
me
out
as
he
said
afterwards
the
intention
was
kind
but
poor
sir
george
is
not
delicate
enough
in
those
matters
i
should
have
done
better
if
he
had
let
me
alone
i
thought
of
the
conversations
we
had
so
often
had
about
mr
faulkland
and
could
not
help
considering
myself
like
a
piece
of
goods
that
was
to
be
shewn
to
the
best
advantage
to
the
purchaser
this
reflection
threw
a
sort
of
constraint
over
my
behaviour
that
fool
as
i
was
i
had
not
courage
enough
to
shake
off
and
i
did
not
acquit
myself
at
all
to
my
own
mind
i
had
notwithstanding
the
good
fortune
to
please
my
mother
infinitely
she
told
me
after
our
visitor
was
gone
that
my
behaviour
had
been
proper
and
blamed
sir
george
for
his
wanting
to
engage
me
too
often
in
conversation
you
may
assure
yourself
son
she
said
that
a
man
of
mr
faulkland
understanding
will
not
like
a
young
lady
the
worse
for
her
silence
she
spoke
enough
to
shew
that
it
was
not
for
want
of
knowing
what
to
say
that
she
held
her
tongue
the
man
who
does
not
reckon
a
modest
reserve
amongst
the
chief
recommendations
of
a
woman
should
be
no
husband
for
sidney
i
am
sure
when
i
married
sir
robert
he
had
never
heard
me
speak
twenty
sentences
sir
george
agreed
with
her
as
to
the
propriety
of
her
observation
in
regard
to
a
modest
reserve
but
said
people
now
did
not
carry
their
ideas
of
it
quite
so
far
as
they
did
when
his
father
courtship
began
with
her
and
added
that
a
young
lady
might
with
as
much
modesty
as
she
could
hold
her
tongue
i
did
not
interfere
in
the
debate
only
said
i
was
very
glad
to
have
my
mother
approbation
of
my
conduct
this
put
an
end
to
the
argument
and
my
mother
launched
out
into
high
encomiums
on
mr
faulkland
she
said
upon
her
he
was
the
finest
young
man
she
ever
saw
in
every
respect
so
modest
so
well
bred
so
very
entertaining
and
so
unassuming
with
all
his
fine
accomplishments
she
was
quite
astonished
and
owned
she
almost
despaired
of
finding
a
young
gentleman
of
the
present
mode
of
education
so
unexceptionable
in
his
behaviour
if
his
morals
answered
to
his
outward
deportment
there
she
stopped
or
rather
sir
george
interrupted
her
i
hope
you
believe
madam
that
my
knowlege
of
mankind
is
not
so
circumscribed
but
that
i
can
distinguish
between
a
real
and
an
assumed
character
and
i
will
venture
to
assert
that
in
the
whole
circle
of
my
acquaintance
i
do
not
know
so
unobjectionable
even
in
your
strict
sense
of
the
word
as
mr
faulkland
well
said
my
mother
i
have
the
pleasure
to
observe
to
you
and
i
think
i
am
seldom
mistaken
in
my
judgment
that
mr
faulkland
is
at
least
as
well
pleased
with
sidney
as
we
are
with
him
what
say
you
daughter
ay
what
you
sister
cry
sir
george
i
think
madam
that
mr
faulkland
is
an
accomplished
gentleman
and
that
you
could
be
content
to
look
no
farther
if
matters
are
brought
to
bear
eh
sidney
i
need
not
tell
you
whose
speech
this
was
brother
that
is
going
a
little
too
far
for
the
first
time
of
my
seeing
him
a
great
too
far
my
mother
said
let
us
first
know
mr
faulkland
mind
from
himself
before
we
say
a
word
more
of
the
matter
sir
george
told
us
that
mr
faulkland
at
going
away
had
requested
he
would
sup
with
him
at
his
own
house
as
he
said
he
had
a
few
visits
of
form
to
pay
and
should
be
at
home
early
in
the
evening
my
mother
and
i
were
in
bed
before
my
brother
came
in
last
night
though
he
keeps
very
good
hours
in
general
when
we
met
this
morning
at
breakfast
i
saw
by
sir
george
face
that
he
was
brimful
of
something
faulkland
do
like
you
sidney
said
he
abruptly
how
can
you
or
i
help
that
brother
cry
i
colouring
tho
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
did
not
believe
him
for
i
knew
if
it
been
so
he
would
not
have
come
out
with
it
so
bluntly
but
my
mother
who
always
takes
every
word
she
hears
literally
took
him
up
very
short
he
does
not
sir
it
is
not
polite
in
you
to
tell
your
sister
so
i
hope
sidney
may
be
by
as
good
a
man
as
mr
faulkland
and
up
she
tossed
her
dear
honest
head
sir
george
burst
out
a
laughing
my
mother
looked
angry
she
was
afraid
her
sagacity
would
be
call
in
question
after
what
she
had
pronounced
the
evening
before
i
looked
silly
but
pretended
to
smile
sir
george
was
clown
enough
to
laugh
on
at
last
to
my
mother
my
dear
madam
can
you
believe
me
serious
in
what
i
said
have
you
so
good
an
opinion
of
my
veracity
or
so
ill
a
one
of
my
breeding
as
to
suppose
i
would
shock
my
sister
by
such
a
rude
declaration
if
i
meant
any
thing
by
it
but
a
joke
indeed
sidney
looking
half
smiling
to
me
i
would
not
be
as
much
in
love
with
our
sovereign
lady
the
queen
as
poor
faulkland
is
with
you
for
my
whole
estate
this
put
me
a
great
deal
more
out
of
countenance
than
what
he
had
said
at
first
nay
brother
now
you
are
too
extravagant
the
other
way
my
mother
looked
surprized
but
recovered
her
good
humour
presently
dear
george
there
is
no
knowing
when
you
are
in
earnest
and
when
not
but
as
sidney
says
now
you
are
rather
too
extravagant
you
might
say
so
to
faulkland
answered
my
brother
if
you
were
to
hear
him
i
could
get
nothing
from
him
the
whole
night
but
your
praises
i
thought
said
my
pleased
mother
he
had
not
the
girl
now
you
see
son
her
did
her
no
harm
and
she
smiled
tenderly
at
me
come
said
sir
george
things
are
mighty
well
on
all
sides
faulkland
has
begged
of
me
that
i
would
use
my
interest
with
you
mother
whom
he
thinks
one
of
the
best
of
women
that
he
may
be
permitted
in
form
to
make
his
addresses
to
miss
bidulph
interest
he
knows
he
has
and
i
hope
madam
it
will
have
your
approbation
he
desired
me
to
explain
minutely
to
you
every
circumstance
of
his
fortune
what
his
estate
is
i
have
told
you
and
his
family
is
of
known
distinction
he
begged
i
would
not
sidney
fortune
and
said
that
if
upon
a
farther
acquaintance
he
should
have
the
happiness
to
be
acceptable
to
my
sister
he
should
insist
upon
leaving
the
appointment
of
her
settlement
to
lady
bidulph
and
myself
i
told
him
i
would
lay
this
proposal
before
you
and
could
for
his
present
comfort
inform
him
that
as
i
believed
my
sister
had
no
prepossessions
in
favour
of
any
one
else
i
was
sure
if
he
met
with
your
concurrence
her
would
follow
of
course
a
very
discreet
answer
said
my
mother
just
such
a
one
as
i
would
have
dictated
to
you
if
i
had
been
at
your
elbow
i
believe
we
may
venture
to
suppose
that
mrs
sidney
no
prepossessions
and
as
this
is
as
handsome
an
offer
as
can
possibly
be
made
i
have
no
objections
if
you
have
none
my
dear
to
admit
mr
faulkland
upon
the
terms
he
proposes
what
answer
ought
i
to
have
made
cecilia
why
to
be
sure
just
the
one
i
make
i
have
prepossessions
madam
looking
down
and
blushing
till
it
actually
pained
me
for
i
was
really
startled
my
cecilia
knows
i
am
not
a
prude
my
dear
cry
my
mother
and
took
me
by
the
hand
poor
sidney
said
sir
george
how
you
are
to
be
pitied
mr
faulkland
purposes
waiting
on
you
in
the
afternoon
if
he
is
not
and
he
looked
so
teazingly
sly
that
my
mother
bid
him
leave
off
his
the
day
is
ever
mr
faulkland
spent
the
evening
with
us
no
other
company
but
our
own
family
my
mother
likes
him
better
even
than
before
thy
disingenuous
girl
why
dost
thou
not
speak
thy
sentiments
there
is
an
apostrophe
for
thy
use
my
cecilia
well
then
sentiments
you
shall
have
you
have
an
undoubted
right
to
know
them
on
all
subjects
but
particularly
on
this
interesting
one
i
think
mr
faulkland
the
most
amiable
of
men
and
if
my
heart
were
happily
for
me
it
is
not
susceptible
of
tender
impressions
i
really
believe
i
should
in
time
be
absolutely
in
love
with
him
this
confession
will
not
satisfy
you
may
be
it
is
not
enough
yet
in
truth
cecilia
it
is
all
that
at
present
i
can
afford
you
the
thoughts
of
the
aukward
figure
i
should
make
in
the
evening
visit
sat
heavy
on
my
spirits
all
can
you
conceive
any
thing
more
distressing
than
the
situation
of
a
poor
girl
receiving
the
visit
of
a
man
who
for
the
first
time
comes
professedly
as
her
admirer
i
had
conceived
a
frightful
idea
of
such
an
interview
having
formed
my
notions
of
it
only
from
romances
where
set
speeches
of
an
ell
long
are
made
by
the
lover
and
answers
of
a
proportionable
size
are
returned
in
form
by
the
lady
but
mr
faulkland
soon
delivered
me
from
my
anxiety
his
easy
but
incomparably
polite
and
sensible
freedom
of
address
quickly
made
me
lose
my
ridiculous
he
made
no
other
use
of
this
visit
than
to
recommend
himself
more
strongly
to
our
esteem
by
such
means
as
proved
how
well
he
deserved
it
if
he
was
particular
to
me
either
in
his
looks
or
manner
it
was
under
the
regulation
of
such
a
nice
decorum
that
i
who
supposed
i
must
have
sunk
with
downright
confusion
was
hardly
disconcerted
during
the
whole
visit
i
do
really
think
my
good
mother
grows
so
fond
of
mr
faulkland
that
if
he
goes
on
at
this
rate
he
will
get
the
start
even
of
sir
george
in
her
affections
said
so
and
so
mr
is
of
opinion
and
i
am
sure
you
will
allow
mr
to
be
a
good
judge
of
such
and
such
things
to
say
the
truth
the
man
improves
upon
you
every
hour
you
know
him
and
yet
i
have
discovered
in
him
some
of
those
little
and
they
are
little
alloys
to
his
many
good
qualities
which
sir
george
at
first
told
me
of
the
interest
i
may
one
day
have
in
him
makes
me
a
closer
observer
than
i
should
otherwise
be
there
that
sly
turn
to
ridicule
which
my
brother
mentioned
yet
to
do
him
justice
he
never
employs
it
but
where
it
is
deserved
and
then
too
with
so
much
vivacity
and
good
humour
that
one
can
not
be
angry
with
him
we
had
a
good
deal
of
company
at
dinner
with
us
to
day
amongst
the
rest
young
sayers
who
is
just
returned
from
his
travels
as
calls
it
you
remember
he
went
away
a
good
humoured
inoffensive
quiet
fool
he
has
brought
no
one
ingredient
of
that
character
back
with
him
but
the
last
for
such
a
stiff
conceited
overbearing
talkative
impertinent
coxcomb
does
not
now
exist
his
mother
who
poor
woman
you
know
originally
made
a
simpleton
of
the
boy
contributes
now
all
in
her
power
to
finish
the
sop
and
she
carries
him
about
with
her
everywhere
for
a
show
we
were
assembled
in
the
drawing
room
before
dinner
in
for
it
was
not
a
common
entry
master
sayers
and
his
mamma
the
cub
handing
in
the
old
lady
stiff
and
aukward
and
ungraceful
and
so
unlike
mr
faulkland
that
i
pitied
the
poor
thing
who
thought
that
every
body
would
admire
him
as
much
as
his
mother
did
after
he
had
been
presented
to
the
ladies
for
it
was
the
first
time
we
had
seen
him
since
he
came
home
he
took
a
turn
or
two
about
the
room
to
exhibit
his
person
then
applying
himself
to
a
picture
which
hung
over
the
door
a
fine
landscape
of
claude
lorrain
which
mr
faulkland
himself
had
brought
over
and
given
to
sir
george
he
asked
my
brother
in
a
tone
scarce
articulate
whether
we
had
any
in
england
my
mother
who
by
chance
heard
him
and
by
greater
chance
understood
him
answered
before
sir
george
had
time
sir
yes
sure
and
some
very
good
ones
too
why
you
can
not
have
forgot
it
is
not
much
above
a
year
since
you
went
abroad
for
you
must
know
he
had
been
recalled
upon
the
death
of
an
uncle
who
had
left
him
his
estate
i
observed
mr
faulkland
constrained
a
very
fly
laugh
on
account
both
of
the
of
my
mother
taking
his
question
and
her
reprimand
sayers
pretended
not
to
hear
her
but
looking
through
his
fingers
as
if
to
throw
the
picture
into
perspective
that
is
a
pretty
good
piece
said
he
for
a
copy
oh
cry
his
mother
there
is
no
pleasing
people
who
have
been
are
such
connoisseurs
in
painting
no
body
making
any
immediate
answer
mr
faulkland
stepped
up
to
mr
sayers
with
such
a
roguish
humility
in
his
countenance
that
you
would
have
sworn
he
was
a
very
ignoramus
said
you
of
opinion
sir
that
that
picture
is
nothing
but
a
copy
nothing
more
take
my
word
for
it
sir
when
was
at
rome
there
was
a
dutchman
there
who
made
it
his
business
to
take
copies
copies
which
he
dispersed
and
had
people
to
sell
for
him
in
different
parts
as
pretty
good
prices
and
they
did
mighty
well
for
very
few
people
a
picture
and
i
answer
for
it
there
are
not
many
masters
of
eminence
but
what
have
a
hundred
originals
palmed
upon
them
more
than
ever
they
painted
in
their
lives
mr
faulkland
then
proceeded
to
ask
him
abundance
of
questions
which
any
one
who
did
not
know
him
well
would
have
thought
he
proposed
for
no
other
end
but
a
desire
of
information
and
the
poor
coxcomb
sayers
plumed
himself
upon
displaying
so
much
travelled
knowlege
to
a
wondering
ignorant
englishman
who
had
never
been
out
of
his
own
country
the
company
were
divided
into
little
chattering
parties
as
is
usual
when
people
are
whiling
away
an
half
hour
before
dinner
sayers
my
mother
and
i
were
sitting
together
on
a
couch
near
enough
to
hear
the
conversation
that
passed
between
the
two
gentlemen
at
least
as
much
as
was
not
sunk
in
the
affected
sentences
of
mr
sayers
his
mother
to
whom
he
was
the
principal
object
of
attention
in
the
company
seemed
mightily
pleased
at
the
opportunity
her
son
had
from
the
inquisitiveness
of
mr
faulkland
whom
she
did
not
know
of
shewing
his
taste
in
the
polite
arts
and
often
looked
about
to
observe
if
any
body
else
attended
to
them
my
mother
dear
literal
woman
as
i
often
call
her
to
you
took
every
thing
seriously
and
whispered
to
me
how
pretty
that
is
sidney
how
condescending
in
mr
faulkland
you
see
he
does
not
make
a
parade
of
his
knowledge
in
these
matters
but
is
pleased
to
reap
the
benefit
of
other
people
i
who
saw
the
latent
roguery
could
hardly
contain
myself
indeed
i
was
amazed
at
mr
faulkland
grave
inquisitive
face
and
was
very
glad
my
mother
did
not
find
him
out
sayers
elated
with
having
shone
so
conspicuously
for
he
observed
that
both
my
mother
and
i
attended
to
his
discourse
proceeded
to
shew
away
with
an
immensity
of
vanity
and
frothy
chat
beginning
every
new
piece
of
history
with
was
at
rome
or
when
was
at
paris
at
last
unluckily
for
him
speaking
of
an
incident
which
made
a
good
deal
of
noise
and
happened
at
the
place
in
which
two
english
gentlemen
had
been
concerned
he
said
it
was
about
eleven
months
ago
just
before
he
left
rome
my
mother
who
had
heard
mr
faulkland
relate
the
same
story
but
with
some
very
different
circumstances
immediately
said
mr
faulkland
have
i
not
heard
you
speak
of
that
you
were
at
rome
yourself
when
the
affair
happened
and
if
i
be
not
mistaken
it
was
through
your
interest
with
the
cardinal
of
that
the
business
was
made
up
if
a
spectre
had
appeared
to
poor
sayers
he
could
not
have
looked
more
aghast
he
dropped
his
visage
down
his
breast
and
for
the
time
speaking
very
and
very
loud
too
with
a
share
of
astonishment
have
been
at
sir
i
was
there
for
a
little
time
sir
answered
mr
faulkland
with
real
modesty
for
he
pitied
the
mortified
buzzard
and
i
know
the
story
was
as
you
have
told
it
the
circumstances
differed
in
a
few
particulars
but
the
facts
were
nearly
as
you
have
related
them
how
obligingly
did
he
reconcile
the
sayers
to
himself
and
to
the
company
were
you
long
abroad
pray
sir
said
the
coxcomb
about
five
years
sir
answered
mr
faulkland
but
i
perceive
by
the
conversation
i
have
had
the
honour
of
holding
with
you
that
many
accurate
and
curious
observations
escaped
me
which
you
made
in
a
much
shorter
space
of
time
for
the
communication
of
which
i
think
myself
extremely
obliged
to
you
whether
the
poor
soul
thought
him
serious
as
my
mother
did
i
can
not
tell
he
made
him
a
bow
however
for
the
compliment
but
was
so
lowered
that
he
did
not
say
a
word
more
of
rome
or
paris
for
the
rest
of
the
day
and
in
this
we
had
a
double
advantage
for
as
he
had
nothing
else
to
talk
of
his
mouth
was
effectually
stopped
except
when
mr
faulkland
out
of
compassion
asked
him
as
he
often
did
such
questions
as
he
thought
he
could
answer
without
exposing
his
ignorance
for
he
was
contented
to
have
enjoyed
it
in
their
tête
à
tête
and
was
far
from
wishing
the
company
to
be
witnesses
of
it
i
think
such
a
bagatelle
may
give
you
some
idea
of
this
man
turn
i
told
it
to
sir
george
he
laughed
heartily
and
said
it
was
like
him
my
brother
loves
even
his
faults
though
he
will
not
allow
me
to
call
them
by
that
name
you
are
unkind
cecilia
and
do
not
do
justice
to
my
sincerity
when
you
say
are
sure
i
am
in
love
with
mr
if
i
were
can
you
conceive
it
possible
that
i
would
deny
it
to
you
ah
my
sister
must
i
suspect
of
wanting
candour
by
your
making
a
charge
of
disingenuity
against
your
friend
indeed
cecilia
if
i
in
love
with
him
i
do
not
know
it
myself
i
will
repeat
it
to
you
i
think
him
the
most
amiable
of
men
and
should
certainly
give
him
the
preference
if
i
were
left
to
a
free
choice
over
all
the
rest
of
his
sex
at
least
all
that
i
have
ever
yet
seen
though
possibly
there
be
handsomer
wiser
better
men
but
they
have
not
fallen
within
my
observation
i
am
not
however
so
prepossessed
in
his
favour
as
to
suppose
him
a
phoenix
and
if
any
unforeseen
event
were
to
prevent
my
being
his
i
am
sure
i
should
bear
it
and
behave
very
handsomely
and
yet
perhaps
this
may
be
only
bragging
like
a
coward
because
i
think
a
very
short
time
will
put
it
out
of
the
power
of
fortune
to
divide
us
yet
certain
as
the
event
of
our
marriage
appears
to
me
at
present
i
still
endeavour
to
keep
a
sort
of
guard
over
my
wishes
and
will
not
give
my
heart
leave
to
center
its
happiness
in
him
and
therefore
i
can
not
rank
myself
amongst
the
lovers
who
have
neither
eyes
nor
ears
nor
sensations
but
for
one
object
mr
faulkland
says
is
his
case
in
regard
to
me
but
i
think
we
women
should
not
love
at
such
a
rate
till
makes
the
passion
a
virtue
and
till
becomes
my
case
i
am
so
much
a
philosopher
in
love
that
i
am
determined
not
to
let
it
absorbe
any
of
the
other
cordial
affections
which
i
owe
to
my
relations
and
my
friends
i
think
we
ought
always
to
form
some
laws
to
ourselves
for
the
regulation
of
our
conduct
without
this
what
an
impertinent
dream
must
the
life
be
of
almost
every
young
person
of
our
sex
you
my
dear
though
with
an
uncommon
understanding
of
your
own
have
always
been
intirely
conducted
by
your
wise
parents
and
in
this
i
make
it
my
boast
to
have
followed
your
example
i
have
been
accustomed
from
my
infancy
to
pay
an
implicit
obedience
to
the
best
of
mothers
the
conforming
to
this
never
yet
cost
me
an
uneasy
minute
and
i
am
sure
never
will
a
little
incident
happened
which
pleased
my
mother
wonderfully
she
had
been
at
morning
prayers
as
you
know
is
her
daily
custom
when
returning
home
in
her
chair
one
of
the
men
happened
to
flip
his
foot
and
fell
down
just
before
mr
faulkland
house
he
was
so
much
hurt
that
he
could
go
no
farther
and
the
footman
immediately
opening
the
chair
told
her
she
had
better
step
into
mr
faulkland
till
he
called
another
or
got
a
man
to
assist
in
carrying
her
home
one
of
mr
faulkland
servants
happened
to
be
standing
at
the
door
so
that
without
any
previous
notice
she
was
immediately
conducted
into
a
parlour
where
mr
faulkland
was
sitting
at
breakfast
she
found
with
him
two
pretty
little
children
at
his
knee
to
one
of
whom
he
had
given
some
cake
and
the
elder
of
the
two
a
boy
of
about
five
years
old
he
was
gravely
lecturing
though
with
great
gentleness
for
having
told
a
lye
my
mother
asked
him
with
some
surprise
whose
children
those
were
he
smiled
and
told
her
they
were
his
coachman
and
then
ordered
the
footman
to
carry
them
down
bidding
the
little
boy
be
sure
to
remember
what
he
had
said
to
him
my
mother
enquired
if
he
permitted
them
to
be
in
the
house
he
said
he
did
and
had
been
induced
to
do
it
from
the
distress
he
had
seen
their
poor
father
in
a
few
days
before
he
is
an
honest
careful
fellow
continued
mr
faulkland
and
has
lived
in
my
family
from
a
boy
he
was
married
to
a
good
sort
of
a
body
who
took
great
care
of
these
children
and
helped
to
maintain
them
decently
by
her
work
the
poor
woman
died
in
childbed
last
week
and
the
person
who
attended
her
in
her
illness
for
she
had
no
servant
took
that
opportunity
of
robbing
the
lodgings
and
after
plundering
the
poor
creature
of
every
thing
that
was
worth
carrying
away
locked
up
those
two
children
which
you
saw
with
me
and
the
infant
with
the
corpse
of
their
mother
the
poor
little
wretches
continued
in
that
dismal
situation
all
night
having
cried
themselves
to
sleep
without
being
heard
though
there
were
some
other
people
in
the
house
the
morning
following
i
happened
to
make
an
early
visit
in
the
neighbourhood
of
this
distressed
little
family
and
my
coachman
who
was
a
very
affectionate
husband
and
father
took
that
opportunity
of
calling
on
his
wife
whom
he
had
not
been
able
to
see
for
three
days
the
cries
of
his
children
now
awake
and
almost
starved
obliged
him
hastily
to
break
open
the
room
door
where
the
poor
fellow
was
shocked
with
the
dismal
spectacle
of
his
wife
lying
breathless
in
her
bed
the
infant
almost
expiring
at
her
side
and
the
other
two
poor
little
famished
creatures
calling
to
their
dead
mother
for
bread
the
sight
almost
deprived
the
man
of
his
senses
he
snatched
up
his
two
eldest
children
in
his
arms
and
ran
raving
to
the
house
where
i
was
tearing
his
hair
like
a
madman
he
told
me
his
mournful
story
with
which
i
was
so
affected
that
i
ordered
one
of
my
footmen
to
carry
the
two
children
home
to
my
house
directly
and
desired
their
father
to
look
out
for
some
body
to
take
care
of
the
young
one
which
he
soon
did
the
honest
poor
fellow
was
delighted
when
he
came
home
to
find
his
two
children
well
and
merry
for
they
were
sensible
of
no
want
but
their
food
but
his
grief
returned
on
him
with
great
violence
at
the
thoughts
of
his
being
obliged
to
put
them
into
the
hands
of
people
who
he
said
he
was
sure
would
not
be
so
kind
to
them
as
their
own
poor
mother
had
been
and
my
man
told
me
he
did
nothing
but
kiss
them
and
cry
over
them
the
whole
day
to
make
his
mind
easy
at
once
i
let
him
know
they
should
remain
here
under
his
own
eye
till
they
were
old
enough
to
be
put
to
school
and
accordingly
directed
my
housekeeper
to
see
that
they
were
taken
care
of
which
has
made
their
father
very
happy
the
little
rogues
have
found
their
way
up
to
me
and
i
love
some
times
to
hear
them
prattle
but
this
morning
the
eldest
having
told
me
a
lye
of
his
brother
i
was
checking
him
for
it
when
you
came
in
my
mother
was
so
pleased
with
mr
faulkland
conduct
in
his
little
history
that
she
repeated
it
to
me
word
for
word
as
soon
as
she
came
home
and
concluded
with
observing
how
a
mr
faulkland
must
be
who
in
so
tender
a
manner
interested
himself
in
his
poor
servant
misfortune
most
young
gentlemen
said
she
would
have
thought
they
had
done
enough
in
giving
the
servant
money
to
have
provided
for
his
children
how
he
could
it
is
in
such
trifles
as
these
that
we
often
discover
the
excellence
of
the
heart
you
will
suppose
my
dear
that
i
am
not
displeased
at
any
circumstance
that
can
raise
mr
faulkland
character
in
my
pious
mother
esteem
i
heard
the
story
with
great
pleasure
but
not
making
any
comments
on
it
sir
george
who
was
present
at
the
relation
said
well
sidney
you
are
either
very
affected
or
the
greatest
stoic
in
the
world
why
any
other
girl
would
be
in
raptures
at
such
a
proof
of
the
honest
tenderness
of
that
heart
which
she
knows
she
possesses
intirely
and
on
which
the
whole
of
her
future
happiness
depends
i
am
very
sensible
of
mr
faulkland
worth
brother
i
replied
and
i
can
feel
without
being
transported
i
will
be
hanged
said
sir
george
if
i
think
you
love
faulkland
at
least
not
half
as
well
as
he
deserves
and
i
dare
swear
you
have
not
been
honest
enough
to
tell
him
yet
whether
you
do
or
not
it
is
time
enough
for
that
i
replied
if
mr
faulkland
and
i
should
be
married
i
hope
i
shall
give
him
no
cause
to
complain
of
my
want
of
affection
you
marry
said
my
brother
i
know
of
no
possible
unless
they
are
of
your
own
making
i
know
of
none
neither
answered
my
mother
yet
i
think
sidney
is
in
the
right
to
be
doubtful
about
all
human
events
many
things
added
she
gravely
for
she
has
a
great
veneration
for
old
sayings
fall
out
between
the
cup
and
the
lip
i
think
mother
said
sir
george
bluntly
were
disappointed
in
your
love
i
have
heard
you
speak
of
it
but
i
forget
the
circumstances
as
i
had
never
heard
my
mother
make
any
mention
of
this
particular
i
begged
she
would
oblige
me
with
relating
it
when
i
was
about
daughter
said
she
a
match
was
concluded
by
my
father
between
me
and
a
very
fine
gentleman
i
loved
him
and
as
i
suppose
all
young
women
do
in
the
like
circumstances
believed
myself
equally
beloved
by
him
the
courtship
had
been
of
a
year
standing
for
you
must
know
i
was
not
very
easily
won
every
thing
was
settled
and
the
day
appointed
for
our
marriage
arrived
when
instead
of
the
bridegroom
whom
we
every
minute
expected
there
came
a
letter
from
him
directed
to
me
the
contents
were
that
having
formerly
been
engaged
to
a
young
lady
by
the
most
solemn
vows
he
had
unfortunately
for
them
both
forgot
them
all
on
seeing
me
and
had
broke
through
every
obligation
divine
and
human
to
obtain
me
he
intreated
mine
and
my
family
pardon
in
the
most
pathetic
manner
for
having
engaged
our
esteem
so
far
as
to
consent
to
an
union
of
which
he
found
himself
unworthy
and
which
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
accomplish
for
said
he
the
wrongs
i
have
done
the
woman
whose
youth
i
seduced
rise
to
my
imagination
with
so
much
horror
that
for
the
empire
of
the
world
i
would
not
complete
my
guilt
by
devoting
that
hand
to
another
to
which
she
only
has
a
right
he
enlarged
greatly
on
the
sufferings
of
his
heart
in
the
struggle
between
his
love
for
me
and
his
duty
to
the
person
who
had
his
first
vows
and
whom
he
declared
his
infidelity
had
almost
brought
to
the
grave
he
claimed
my
pity
both
on
his
own
and
her
account
and
repeatedly
intreated
my
forgiveness
of
his
fault
the
whole
letter
which
was
very
long
was
so
expressive
of
a
mind
overwhelmed
with
despair
that
i
was
exceedingly
shocked
at
the
reading
of
it
what
could
i
say
the
plea
he
offered
for
his
seemingly
strange
conduct
was
too
just
to
admit
of
any
objections
i
own
the
disappointment
afflicted
me
but
i
bore
it
with
a
becoming
resolution
my
family
were
at
first
exceedingly
exasperated
against
my
doubly
unfaithful
lover
but
upon
enquiring
into
the
facts
they
found
the
truth
to
be
as
he
had
represented
it
the
conclusion
was
that
upon
the
very
day
on
which
he
was
to
have
been
married
to
me
and
on
which
he
had
writ
me
that
gloomy
letter
he
was
seized
with
a
melancholy
with
increasing
on
him
daily
soon
after
ended
in
absolute
madness
and
he
was
obliged
to
be
confined
for
the
remainder
for
his
life
the
young
lady
lived
but
a
short
time
after
the
melancholy
fate
of
her
lover
and
died
as
it
was
said
of
a
broken
heart
it
was
a
great
comfort
to
me
to
reflect
that
my
fate
disposed
otherwise
of
me
than
to
this
unhappy
gentleman
for
i
am
very
sure
had
these
fatal
events
happened
in
consequence
of
my
marriage
with
him
that
i
should
never
have
survived
it
this
extraordinary
anecdote
of
my
mother
life
which
i
had
never
had
a
hint
of
before
for
she
could
not
speak
of
it
without
great
emotion
very
much
affected
me
sir
george
said
the
story
was
more
tragical
than
he
had
apprehended
and
told
my
mother
was
an
accident
which
fell
out
between
the
cup
and
the
lip
with
a
vengeance
my
mother
continued
thoughtful
for
a
good
while
and
i
was
sorry
that
the
memory
of
this
melancholy
story
had
been
revived
but
sir
george
talked
and
laughed
us
both
in
spirits
again
this
mr
faulkland
is
a
princely
man
he
has
sent
me
a
set
of
jewels
my
mother
says
they
are
too
fine
for
a
private
gentlewoman
but
george
tells
her
they
are
not
a
bit
too
fine
for
mr
faulkland
and
only
suitable
to
his
fortune
you
know
i
have
but
few
of
my
own
those
only
which
were
my
mother
when
she
was
a
maiden
the
greatest
part
of
her
and
by
much
the
finest
were
presented
to
her
by
my
father
but
those
she
reserves
for
sir
george
against
the
time
of
his
marriage
as
a
present
for
his
lady
for
they
are
family
jewels
my
probation
is
over
my
the
formidable
question
has
been
put
to
me
and
i
have
answered
it
ay
marry
say
you
but
how
in
the
to
be
sure
my
dear
no
no
my
cecilia
a
valuable
psha
what
an
affected
cold
word
that
is
a
lovely
and
most
worthy
man
with
six
thousand
pounds
a
year
is
a
prize
that
a
country
girl
must
not
expect
to
draw
every
day
mr
faulkland
in
phrase
demanded
from
me
the
time
of
his
destined
happiness
i
referred
him
to
my
mother
she
good
and
delicate
as
she
is
referred
him
back
to
sir
george
george
blurted
out
some
sudden
day
that
startled
us
both
when
mr
faulkland
reported
it
to
us
i
stammered
out
something
my
mother
hesitated
sir
george
came
in
and
blundered
at
us
all
so
i
think
we
compounded
for
the
time
and
amongst
us
fixed
upon
this
day
month
and
full
soon
enough
says
my
cecilia
you
have
known
the
man
but
about
six
weeks
and
surely
a
month
is
as
little
time
as
you
can
take
in
preparing
fineries
true
my
girl
true
but
it
is
all
george
doings
indeed
my
cecilia
without
affectation
i
had
much
rather
have
had
a
longer
day
though
i
think
i
the
man
as
well
in
those
six
weeks
as
if
i
had
been
acquainted
with
him
so
many
years
for
he
has
spent
most
of
his
hours
with
us
every
day
during
that
time
and
my
mother
says
he
is
one
of
those
in
there
is
no
sir
george
is
downright
insolent
he
declares
i
am
not
sensible
of
my
own
happiness
and
that
i
deserve
to
be
married
to
some
little
petty
wiltshire
he
so
piques
himself
upon
making
this
match
there
is
no
bearing
him
he
has
taken
all
matters
of
settlement
upon
himself
and
insists
on
my
mother
not
interposing
she
acquiesces
but
charges
my
brother
not
to
let
mr
faulkland
generosity
carry
him
too
far
and
bids
him
remember
what
is
due
to
his
friend
as
well
as
to
his
sister
i
really
begin
to
be
hurried
my
mother
you
know
is
exactly
punctilious
in
every
thing
such
a
quantity
of
things
bought
and
such
a
quantity
to
bought
that
there
is
no
end
of
journies
into
the
city
then
milaners
and
one
would
think
i
was
going
to
pass
the
remainder
of
my
life
in
a
remote
country
where
there
were
no
kind
of
manufactures
or
artificers
to
be
come
at
and
that
i
was
to
provide
cloathing
for
half
a
century
i
have
much
upon
my
hands
and
sir
george
is
so
impatient
and
troublesome
that
i
believe
i
must
employ
an
amanuensis
to
give
you
a
minute
detail
of
all
our
foppery
for
i
shall
not
have
patience
to
do
it
myself
sir
george
has
often
told
me
that
he
knows
of
no
fault
mr
faulkland
has
but
a
violence
of
temper
when
provoked
i
saw
an
instance
of
it
which
i
was
sorry
for
and
the
more
so
as
i
was
in
some
measure
accessary
to
it
mr
faulkland
my
brother
a
lady
of
our
acquaintance
and
myself
took
a
ride
in
this
morning
we
were
to
dine
at
kensington
where
my
mother
was
to
meet
us
at
the
house
of
the
lady
a
relation
of
mr
faulkland
who
was
with
us
we
rode
into
the
of
her
house
in
order
to
alight
my
horse
which
happened
to
be
a
young
one
that
sir
george
had
newly
bought
saw
some
object
that
made
him
shy
of
advancing
and
he
turned
suddenly
about
a
footman
of
mr
faulkland
who
chanced
to
stand
just
behind
me
very
imprudently
though
i
am
sure
with
design
of
harm
gave
him
a
stroke
with
his
whip
which
made
the
animal
plunge
and
throw
me
as
i
had
not
time
to
recover
my
seat
from
the
first
short
turn
he
made
i
luckily
received
not
the
least
hurt
and
was
on
my
feet
in
an
instant
but
mr
faulkland
who
had
leaped
off
his
horse
even
before
i
fell
was
so
enraged
at
the
fellow
that
he
gave
him
two
or
three
sound
lashes
with
his
whip
across
the
shoulders
which
fell
on
him
as
quick
as
lightning
i
am
inclined
to
think
the
servant
was
not
sober
for
he
had
the
insolence
to
lay
hold
of
his
master
whip
and
muttered
an
oath
or
two
mr
faulkland
attention
being
quickly
turned
to
me
he
took
no
farther
notice
of
the
man
we
went
into
the
house
and
after
i
had
assured
them
all
i
was
not
in
the
least
hurt
i
begged
of
mr
faulkland
to
forgive
the
footman
who
had
undesignedly
caused
the
accident
he
made
a
thousand
apologies
for
having
let
his
anger
so
far
transport
him
as
to
chastise
his
servant
in
a
manner
he
was
not
used
to
do
but
the
peril
he
put
you
into
madam
addressing
himself
to
me
made
me
forget
myself
i
repeated
i
hope
sir
you
have
forgiven
him
i
wish
my
dear
miss
bidulph
said
he
that
the
fellow
were
guilty
of
no
other
fault
but
this
that
i
might
shew
you
my
readiness
to
obey
you
but
he
is
such
an
intolerable
sot
that
there
is
no
keeping
him
with
safety
i
have
forgiven
him
several
idle
things
but
as
i
had
determined
to
part
with
him
before
this
happened
i
hope
you
will
be
so
good
as
not
to
insist
on
my
retaining
him
i
could
not
intercede
for
the
foolish
fellow
after
this
so
said
no
more
this
little
incident
convinces
me
that
mr
faulkland
is
of
too
warm
a
temper
yet
i
am
not
alarmed
at
the
discovery
you
know
i
am
the
very
reverse
and
i
hope
in
time
by
gentle
methods
in
some
measure
to
subdue
it
in
mr
faulkland
his
own
good
sense
and
good
nature
must
incline
him
to
wish
it
corrected
my
brother
says
he
has
often
lamented
this
vice
of
his
nature
to
him
and
said
he
had
taken
infinite
pains
to
get
the
better
of
it
and
had
so
far
succeeded
that
he
seldom
was
surprized
by
it
but
on
very
sudden
and
extraordinary
occasions
such
as
i
suppose
he
looked
upon
this
to
be
which
i
have
related
we
passed
the
day
delightfully
at
kensington
and
did
not
return
to
town
till
late
i
think
i
have
got
cold
as
we
walked
a
long
time
in
the
gardens
i
have
got
an
ugly
sore
throat
my
mother
insists
on
my
being
let
blood
i
am
afraid
of
alarming
her
by
complaining
though
i
had
very
little
rest
all
night
mr
faulkland
came
early
this
morning
to
enquire
after
my
health
my
mother
told
him
i
was
not
well
how
tenderly
dejected
were
his
looks
when
i
came
into
the
room
sir
george
made
him
stay
to
breakfast
he
scarce
tasted
any
thing
he
was
quite
cast
down
my
brother
rallied
him
i
thought
it
unreasonable
on
the
chance
he
had
the
day
before
of
losing
his
wife
mr
faulkland
answered
i
wish
i
had
followed
the
first
motion
of
my
thoughts
and
discharged
that
wicked
fellow
a
month
ago
sir
george
said
as
it
happened
there
had
been
no
harm
done
but
he
thought
mr
faulkland
would
do
well
to
dismiss
such
an
insolent
rogue
from
his
service
he
has
saved
me
that
trouble
said
mr
faulkland
he
has
dismissed
himself
but
took
care
to
first
to
rob
me
to
rob
you
we
all
repeated
in
the
same
breath
yes
said
mr
faulkland
i
told
him
after
i
got
home
that
he
was
to
deliver
up
such
things
as
he
had
in
his
charge
to
my
own
man
as
i
meant
to
discharge
him
in
the
morning
he
made
me
no
reply
for
he
was
a
sullen
fellow
but
when
the
family
were
asleep
he
contrived
to
pick
the
lock
of
a
bureau
in
my
dressing
room
where
i
sometimes
keep
money
i
believe
what
induced
him
to
it
was
his
having
seen
me
yesterday
morning
when
i
was
going
to
ride
a
precaution
which
i
generally
use
put
my
pocket
book
into
this
place
and
i
suppose
he
concluded
there
were
bank
notes
in
it
for
he
took
i
presume
without
staying
to
examine
it
and
all
the
money
he
could
find
besides
and
very
cleverly
made
his
escape
out
of
a
back
window
which
was
found
open
this
morning
my
mother
lectured
mr
faulkland
a
little
for
suffering
a
servant
whose
fidelity
he
was
not
sure
of
to
see
where
he
deposited
his
money
which
she
said
might
prove
a
temptation
to
one
who
was
so
ill
inclined
as
this
man
mr
faulkland
acknowleged
it
was
careless
in
him
but
said
in
his
justification
he
had
been
accustomed
to
very
honest
people
about
him
which
rendered
him
less
suspicious
he
appeared
so
anxious
and
unhappy
about
my
indisposition
that
i
affected
to
make
as
light
of
it
as
possible
though
indeed
i
find
myself
very
much
out
of
order
with
what
a
kind
sorrow
did
he
observe
my
looks
sighs
now
and
then
stole
from
him
as
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
my
face
i
am
obliged
to
him
yet
i
think
i
should
be
as
much
concerned
for
if
he
were
ill
here
is
a
whole
cargo
of
silks
and
laces
just
sent
in
to
me
i
ca
look
at
them
i
am
not
well
and
i
have
such
a
gantlope
to
run
of
visiting
and
racketting
that
the
thought
makes
me
sicker
after
a
fortnight
a
dreadful
fortnight
intermission
i
reassume
my
pen
i
have
often
told
you
cecilia
i
was
not
born
to
be
happy
oh
i
prophesied
when
i
said
so
though
i
knew
not
why
i
said
it
i
will
try
to
recollect
all
the
circumstances
of
this
miserable
interval
and
relate
them
as
well
as
i
can
the
last
line
in
my
journal
which
i
have
not
yet
ventured
to
send
you
as
your
stay
at
paris
is
so
uncertain
informs
you
that
i
was
ill
i
was
let
blood
but
my
disorder
increased
and
i
was
in
a
high
fever
before
next
morning
i
remember
what
my
reflections
were
and
am
sure
my
apprehensions
of
death
were
not
on
my
account
afflicting
but
grievously
so
at
the
thoughts
of
what
those
should
feel
whom
i
was
to
leave
behind
my
mother
and
mr
faulkland
i
believe
chiefly
engaged
my
mind
but
i
did
not
long
continue
capable
of
reflection
the
violence
of
my
disorder
deprived
me
of
my
senses
on
the
fourth
day
and
they
tell
me
i
raved
of
mr
faulkland
i
remember
nothing
but
that
in
my
intervals
of
reason
i
always
saw
my
poor
mother
in
tears
by
my
bedside
i
was
in
the
utmost
danger
but
it
pleased
god
to
restore
me
to
the
ardent
prayers
of
my
dear
parent
in
about
ten
days
i
began
to
shew
some
symptoms
of
amendment
and
enquired
how
mr
faulkland
did
my
mother
answered
he
is
well
my
dear
and
gone
out
of
town
but
i
believe
will
return
in
a
day
or
two
gone
out
of
town
said
i
and
leave
me
dying
indeed
that
was
not
kind
of
mr
faulkland
and
i
shall
tell
him
so
my
mother
was
sitting
on
the
bedside
and
had
hold
of
my
hand
my
brother
was
standing
with
his
back
to
the
fire
place
i
observed
they
looked
at
one
another
but
neither
made
me
any
answer
pray
sir
george
i
cried
would
you
serve
the
woman
so
whom
you
were
so
near
making
your
wife
my
brother
was
going
to
reply
but
my
mother
frowned
at
him
he
looked
displeased
and
went
out
of
the
room
dear
madam
said
i
there
is
something
the
matter
with
mr
faulkland
do
keep
me
in
suspence
i
there
is
something
which
you
and
my
brother
would
conceal
from
me
is
mr
faulkland
sick
not
that
i
know
of
i
assure
you
answered
my
mother
he
was
well
yesterday
for
we
had
a
message
from
him
to
enquire
after
your
health
as
we
have
had
every
day
for
he
is
but
at
richmond
and
you
know
if
he
were
in
town
he
could
receive
no
other
satisfaction
than
hearing
from
you
as
you
are
too
ill
to
admit
of
any
visits
my
mother
rang
the
bell
immediately
and
asked
me
to
take
something
i
saw
she
wanted
to
turn
the
conversation
my
maid
ellen
came
into
the
room
and
i
asked
no
more
questions
my
mother
staid
with
me
till
it
was
time
for
her
to
go
to
rest
but
avoided
mentioning
mr
faulkland
name
or
giving
me
any
opportunity
of
doing
it
for
she
tenderly
conjured
me
to
keep
myself
quite
composed
and
not
to
talk
the
doctor
assured
her
this
night
that
he
thought
me
out
of
danger
and
she
retired
with
looks
of
cordial
delight
she
was
no
sooner
gone
than
i
called
ellen
to
my
bedside
and
charged
her
to
tell
me
all
she
knew
concerning
mr
faulkland
the
poor
girl
looked
concerned
and
seemed
to
study
for
an
answer
lord
bless
me
madam
what
should
i
know
of
him
more
than
my
lady
has
told
you
when
did
you
see
him
said
i
not
for
several
days
she
answered
where
is
he
at
richmond
i
heard
sir
george
say
but
i
suppose
he
will
come
to
town
as
soon
as
he
hears
you
are
well
enough
to
receive
him
i
catched
hold
of
her
hand
i
know
there
is
something
relative
to
mr
faulkland
which
you
all
want
to
hide
from
me
do
attempt
to
deceive
me
you
may
be
sure
whatever
it
be
i
must
soon
be
informed
of
it
in
the
mean
while
my
doubts
make
me
very
unhappy
the
girl
trouble
and
confusion
increased
as
i
spoke
my
dear
madam
she
replied
when
you
are
better
my
lady
will
tell
you
all
no
ellen
i
must
know
it
now
tell
it
me
this
minute
or
you
must
never
expect
to
see
me
better
under
such
uncertainty
what
is
the
the
frightful
that
i
am
to
be
told
how
you
have
shocked
me
with
that
little
word
i
know
nothing
madam
answered
ellen
but
what
i
gathered
from
sir
george
loud
angry
talk
with
my
lady
and
i
should
be
undone
if
her
ladyship
were
to
know
i
mentioned
it
to
you
i
assured
her
my
mother
should
not
know
it
why
then
madam
speaking
lower
i
am
afraid
that
mr
faulkland
has
misbehaved
or
has
been
belied
to
my
lady
she
stopped
at
this
how
how
cried
i
eagerly
what
has
she
heard
of
him
something
of
another
courtship
she
replied
but
i
hope
it
is
all
false
you
trifle
with
me
speak
out
and
say
all
you
know
the
poor
creature
started
at
my
impatience
know
no
more
madam
than
that
i
heard
my
lady
say
to
sir
george
i
had
rather
sidney
were
in
her
grave
than
married
to
him
sir
george
said
but
why
will
not
you
not
let
mr
faulkland
justify
himself
madam
justify
himself
my
lady
answered
what
can
he
say
is
it
not
plain
that
he
is
false
to
another
woman
they
talked
lower
but
at
last
sir
george
raised
his
voice
and
said
he
would
give
half
his
estate
to
have
the
villain
punished
all
this
madam
i
by
mere
accident
sir
george
was
going
abroad
his
linen
was
lying
ready
for
him
in
his
and
his
man
desired
me
to
put
a
stitch
in
one
of
his
master
point
ruffles
which
was
a
little
ripped
in
the
gathering
i
had
come
up
the
back
stairs
into
the
just
as
my
lady
who
was
with
sir
george
in
the
said
the
words
i
first
repeated
and
while
i
stood
doing
the
ruffle
i
heard
the
rest
there
was
a
great
deal
more
said
but
i
could
not
distinguish
any
thing
besides
except
a
word
here
and
there
which
sir
george
seemed
to
speak
in
a
very
angry
tone
this
was
the
second
day
of
your
illness
mr
faulkland
had
been
here
in
the
morning
to
enquire
how
you
did
my
lady
saw
him
and
i
thought
they
parted
very
friendly
i
met
mr
faulkland
coming
down
stairs
he
looked
full
of
grief
my
lady
stood
at
the
door
and
wished
him
a
good
morning
about
an
hour
after
came
a
letter
directed
to
you
it
was
brought
by
a
porter
who
said
it
required
no
answer
as
you
were
too
ill
to
read
it
i
gave
it
to
my
lady
and
it
was
soon
after
this
that
i
heard
the
conversation
between
sir
george
and
her
ladyship
mr
faulkland
came
again
in
the
evening
sir
george
was
not
at
home
but
my
lady
had
him
above
an
hour
in
the
and
the
footman
who
let
him
out
said
he
looked
as
if
he
were
in
sad
trouble
he
has
never
been
here
since
but
sends
constantly
every
day
to
know
how
you
do
my
lady
ordered
me
if
any
letters
came
for
you
to
deliver
them
to
her
and
has
there
any
come
to
me
no
madam
word
was
always
sent
to
mr
faulkland
of
your
being
so
ill
that
to
be
sure
he
thought
it
would
be
in
vain
for
him
to
write
to
you
this
was
all
i
could
gather
from
the
maid
what
a
night
did
i
pass
i
scarce
closed
my
eyes
ellen
lay
in
a
by
me
she
had
watched
several
nights
and
i
obliged
her
now
to
undress
and
go
into
bed
she
slept
soundly
how
i
envied
her
tranquility
if
i
forgot
myself
for
a
few
minutes
my
slumbers
were
distracted
and
i
started
at
the
recollection
of
what
i
had
already
heard
and
the
dread
of
what
i
had
to
hear
mr
faulkland
absenting
himself
from
the
house
so
long
my
mother
wishing
me
in
the
grave
rather
than
be
his
wife
my
brother
denouncing
vengeance
on
the
these
were
the
terrible
ideas
that
haunted
me
till
morning
what
can
he
have
done
i
cried
aloud
several
times
i
summoned
to
my
aid
all
the
fortitude
i
was
mistress
of
and
resolved
not
to
sink
under
the
calamity
be
it
of
what
nature
it
would
my
mother
ever
kind
and
tender
came
early
the
next
morning
into
my
room
she
enquired
after
my
health
and
looked
as
if
she
me
i
was
ready
to
cry
at
her
compassionate
glances
they
mortified
me
but
i
was
determined
not
to
let
her
perceive
it
i
told
her
i
was
much
better
and
what
is
surprizing
i
was
really
so
notwithstanding
the
uneasy
state
of
my
mind
she
talked
of
indifferent
things
and
said
she
hoped
i
should
soon
be
able
to
go
into
the
country
for
a
few
days
to
recover
a
little
strength
i
answered
i
hope
so
too
madam
we
were
both
silent
for
a
while
my
mother
had
her
indulgent
eyes
fixed
upon
me
mine
were
cast
down
at
last
i
resolved
to
speak
out
madam
said
i
looking
steadfastly
at
her
what
is
the
cause
of
your
coldness
towards
mr
faulkland
is
in
vain
for
you
to
hide
it
longer
you
say
he
is
and
gone
out
of
town
if
he
has
shewn
any
slight
towards
me
tell
me
so
at
once
and
do
not
entertain
so
mean
an
opinion
of
your
daughter
as
to
suppose
she
can
not
bear
the
news
your
tenderness
i
see
would
conceal
from
me
but
believe
me
madam
i
am
prepared
for
the
worst
my
dear
replied
my
mother
it
gives
me
great
pleasure
to
hear
you
say
so
i
pray
god
preserve
my
child
and
grant
her
a
better
lot
than
she
could
hope
for
in
a
union
with
mr
faulkland
what
has
he
done
madam
my
dearest
sidney
she
answered
this
is
the
first
trial
you
have
ever
had
of
your
patience
but
i
have
no
doubt
that
your
goodness
and
discretion
will
teach
you
to
act
as
becomes
your
character
i
did
not
intend
to
have
spoken
to
you
on
the
subject
till
you
were
better
able
to
bear
the
knowlege
of
what
i
am
going
to
acquaint
you
with
but
your
prudence
i
think
makes
you
equal
to
every
thing
and
i
hope
your
health
will
not
be
endangered
by
the
discovery
of
mr
faulkland
baseness
what
a
dreadful
preface
the
day
after
you
were
taken
ill
a
letter
directed
to
you
was
brought
hither
by
a
porter
which
your
maid
very
discretely
delivered
to
me
as
you
were
not
in
a
condition
to
read
it
yourself
i
thought
proper
to
open
it
the
cover
contained
a
few
lines
addressed
to
you
and
in
it
was
inclosed
a
letter
directed
to
mr
faulkland
good
god
added
she
taking
the
papers
out
of
her
pocket
how
little
reliance
ought
we
to
have
on
a
fair
outside
here
are
the
letters
read
what
is
in
the
cover
first
i
did
so
it
was
ill
writ
and
worse
spelt
these
were
the
contents
madam
i
hear
you
are
soon
to
be
married
to
mr
faulkland
but
as
i
think
it
a
great
pity
that
so
virtuous
a
young
lady
should
be
thrown
away
this
is
to
inform
you
that
he
does
not
deserve
you
the
inclosed
letter
wrote
to
him
by
a
fine
and
beautiful
young
lady
that
he
decoyed
shews
you
how
false
he
is
when
you
tax
him
with
it
he
will
know
from
whence
you
got
your
information
but
let
him
deny
it
if
he
can
i
am
madam
you
unknown
friend
and
humble
servant
the
letter
to
mr
faulkland
in
a
very
pretty
female
hand
and
the
date
but
a
week
old
from
the
time
it
was
sent
to
me
was
as
follows
oh
mr
faulkland
i
am
the
most
unfortunate
woman
in
the
world
fatal
have
you
been
to
me
and
i
am
undone
for
ever
i
was
in
hopes
that
our
mutual
fault
might
have
been
concealed
for
while
we
staid
at
bath
i
kept
my
aunt
intirely
ignorant
of
what
passed
between
us
though
she
often
pressed
me
to
confess
the
truth
but
it
can
now
no
longer
be
concealed
i
am
but
too
sensibly
reminded
of
the
unhappy
consequences
of
my
own
weakness
and
your
ungoverned
would
i
could
call
it
love
i
never
meant
to
trouble
you
with
complaints
but
my
present
condition
calls
loudly
for
your
compassion
are
you
then
really
going
to
be
married
there
wants
but
this
to
complete
my
destruction
oh
sir
before
it
is
too
late
take
pity
on
me
i
dare
not
continue
in
the
house
with
my
uncle
much
longer
my
aunt
says
that
when
my
affliction
becomes
so
conspicuous
as
not
to
be
any
longer
hid
she
will
form
a
pretence
on
account
of
my
health
for
me
to
be
absent
for
some
months
under
colour
of
going
to
bath
or
to
london
for
better
advice
than
i
can
have
here
but
what
will
this
avail
me
i
have
no
relations
no
friends
nor
acquaintance
that
i
can
trust
with
the
secret
of
my
miserable
situation
to
whom
then
can
i
fly
but
to
you
the
cause
of
all
my
sorrow
i
beseech
you
for
sake
write
to
me
and
tell
me
if
indeed
you
are
going
to
give
your
self
away
for
ever
if
you
are
your
intended
bride
perhaps
may
have
no
other
advantage
of
me
but
what
you
in
an
evil
hour
deprived
me
of
write
to
me
dear
though
cruel
as
you
are
and
think
of
some
place
of
refuge
for
your
unhappy
when
i
had
read
these
letters
my
mother
asked
me
what
i
thought
of
mr
faulkland
indeed
i
was
so
astonished
that
i
scarce
knew
what
answer
to
make
but
replied
madam
are
you
satisfied
that
this
letter
is
not
forged
with
a
design
to
injure
mr
faulkland
ah
my
dear
said
she
i
am
sorry
you
strive
to
catch
at
so
slender
a
twig
you
may
be
sure
i
am
but
too
well
convinced
that
the
letter
is
genuine
or
you
should
never
have
had
a
moment
uneasiness
by
the
knowlege
of
it
mr
faulkland
himself
does
not
deny
it
and
it
is
with
his
permission
that
i
kept
it
i
promised
to
return
it
but
desired
leave
to
retain
it
for
a
few
days
he
could
not
refuse
me
this
though
he
might
easily
imagine
i
designed
to
shew
it
to
you
that
indeed
my
intention
when
i
desired
to
keep
it
a
little
while
in
my
hands
and
i
did
so
that
i
might
have
your
judgment
on
the
letter
itself
as
well
as
fully
to
justify
my
own
proceedings
in
what
i
have
done
ah
dear
madam
cry
i
scarce
knowing
what
i
said
i
rely
on
your
maternal
goodness
i
am
sure
you
have
done
what
is
proper
yet
has
mr
faulkland
nothing
to
say
for
himself
but
i
will
ask
no
more
questions
i
know
too
much
already
my
love
said
my
mother
you
have
a
right
to
know
every
thing
relative
to
this
affair
i
shewed
the
letters
to
your
brother
as
soon
as
i
received
them
sir
george
at
first
seemed
quite
confounded
but
afterwards
to
my
very
great
surprize
he
smiled
and
said
he
knew
of
that
foolish
business
before
i
asked
him
if
he
knew
of
it
before
how
he
could
answer
it
to
his
honour
his
conscience
or
the
love
he
ought
to
bear
his
sister
not
to
divulge
it
immediately
why
said
he
i
assure
you
it
is
a
affair
that
ought
not
to
make
you
uneasy
what
george
i
answered
i
a
trivial
matter
for
a
man
to
ruin
a
fine
young
lady
forsake
her
and
dare
to
involve
an
innocent
creature
in
his
crimes
do
you
call
this
a
affair
if
you
knew
the
said
he
you
would
not
view
it
in
so
disadvantageous
a
light
faulkland
certainly
gained
the
affections
of
a
young
lady
though
without
seeking
to
do
so
he
never
courted
her
never
attempted
to
please
her
much
less
to
win
her
heart
and
least
of
all
to
ruin
her
virtue
i
know
that
is
an
action
he
is
not
capable
of
committing
how
comes
it
to
pass
then
that
he
so
said
i
interrupting
him
why
the
girl
was
silly
and
she
was
thrown
in
his
way
by
a
vile
designing
woman
that
had
the
care
of
her
was
he
again
stopping
him
to
take
advantage
of
her
folly
and
join
with
that
woman
to
destroy
a
poor
young
creature
honour
the
men
said
he
confidently
may
fall
into
an
error
and
if
you
expect
to
find
a
man
entirely
free
from
them
you
look
for
what
is
not
possible
in
human
nature
i
may
expect
to
find
a
man
without
flagrant
crimes
to
answer
for
i
hope
and
i
believe
i
spoke
it
with
warmth
do
you
call
one
madam
said
he
with
still
more
assurance
i
hope
sidney
will
not
be
such
a
chit
as
to
think
in
this
manner
when
she
comes
to
hear
the
affair
explained
i
really
grew
angry
and
could
not
forbear
saying
i
would
rather
see
you
married
to
your
grave
than
to
such
a
man
your
brother
then
begged
i
would
hear
mr
faulkland
and
be
a
little
cool
till
that
was
done
i
told
him
there
was
a
terrible
fact
alleged
of
which
i
could
not
conceive
it
possible
for
him
to
acquit
himself
george
said
he
had
a
letter
to
shew
me
on
the
subject
which
he
had
received
from
mr
faulkland
while
he
was
at
bath
and
which
he
was
sure
would
convince
me
that
the
whole
affair
was
so
trifling
it
ought
by
no
means
to
be
objected
to
mr
faulkland
nor
in
his
opinion
even
mentioned
to
him
i
told
him
i
was
sorry
to
find
that
he
and
i
thought
so
differently
for
that
i
was
determined
to
speak
to
mr
faulkland
immediately
about
it
and
if
he
could
not
satisfy
me
intirely
on
the
score
of
the
injured
lady
that
he
must
never
think
of
sidney
more
your
brother
said
that
the
letter
which
was
sent
to
you
had
come
from
the
revengeful
dog
who
had
robbed
his
master
and
that
he
would
give
half
his
estate
to
have
the
villain
punished
as
he
deserved
mr
faulkland
it
seems
had
told
him
this
himself
the
fellow
found
it
in
the
which
he
had
taken
out
of
the
escrutore
and
his
disappointment
perhaps
at
not
getting
a
better
booty
for
he
found
but
twenty
moidores
besides
joined
to
his
malice
against
his
master
incited
him
to
make
the
use
he
did
of
this
letter
now
continued
my
mother
though
the
fellow
is
undoubtedly
a
vile
creature
yet
my
dear
i
think
are
obliged
to
him
for
this
discovery
providentially
as
it
has
come
to
save
you
from
what
in
my
opinion
would
be
the
worst
of
misfortunes
the
loss
of
this
letter
had
alarmed
mr
faulkland
so
much
that
he
put
an
advertisement
into
the
papers
next
day
worded
in
so
particular
a
manner
as
shewed
how
very
fearful
he
was
of
that
letter
coming
to
light
for
no
doubt
he
suspected
the
man
might
make
a
dangerous
use
of
it
the
advertisement
said
that
if
the
servant
who
had
absconded
from
his
master
house
in
st
james
square
the
night
before
would
restore
the
papers
which
he
took
with
him
they
should
be
received
without
any
questions
being
asked
and
a
reward
of
twenty
guineas
paid
to
any
person
who
should
bring
them
back
this
advertisement
which
to
be
sure
the
fellow
either
did
not
see
at
all
or
had
not
time
enough
to
avail
himself
of
it
shews
you
to
what
sad
resources
people
are
driven
who
having
done
unwarrantable
actions
are
often
in
the
power
of
the
lowest
wretches
i
own
this
circumstance
gave
me
a
very
ill
impression
of
mr
faulkland
your
brother
says
he
remembers
this
man
was
one
of
the
servants
he
took
with
him
to
bath
and
without
doubt
he
knew
of
his
amour
the
advertisement
has
since
been
changed
by
sir
george
advice
i
find
the
man
is
named
his
person
described
and
a
reward
of
fifty
pounds
offered
for
the
apprehending
him
but
i
take
it
for
granted
he
has
got
out
of
reach
though
his
little
digression
was
very
pertinent
i
was
impatient
to
know
what
had
passed
between
my
mother
and
mr
faulkland
on
the
fatal
subject
and
could
not
forbear
asking
her
i
shall
tell
you
said
she
in
order
your
brother
and
i
had
some
farther
altercations
and
indeed
my
dear
it
amazes
me
to
find
that
a
young
man
educated
as
sir
george
was
in
the
early
part
of
life
in
the
strictest
principles
of
virtue
and
the
son
of
parents
who
thank
god
always
gave
him
the
best
example
should
have
so
far
deviated
from
the
sober
paths
he
was
brought
up
in
as
to
treat
the
most
glaring
vices
with
a
levity
that
shocked
me
but
i
suppose
the
company
he
kept
abroad
among
whom
this
hypocrite
faulkland
was
his
chief
has
quite
perverted
him
he
gave
me
the
letter
to
read
which
he
had
received
from
his
friend
whilst
he
was
at
bath
and
which
he
said
was
to
convince
me
that
it
was
such
a
affair
that
we
ought
not
to
take
the
least
notice
of
it
and
all
his
reason
for
this
was
truly
because
that
loose
man
treats
the
subject
as
lightly
as
he
does
i
am
afraid
sir
george
is
no
better
than
himself
or
he
would
not
have
ventured
to
make
him
the
confidant
of
his
wild
amours
and
that
at
a
time
too
when
he
was
encouraged
to
address
you
he
tells
him
of
a
very
pretty
young
lady
innocent
he
says
too
that
he
got
acquainted
with
who
came
to
bath
under
the
care
of
an
aunt
and
uncle
he
talks
some
idle
stuff
of
avoiding
her
when
he
found
she
liked
him
and
that
the
aunt
wicked
woman
contrived
to
leave
them
together
one
evening
when
i
understand
the
poor
young
creature
fell
into
the
snare
that
was
prepared
for
her
for
would
you
believe
it
my
dear
the
monstrous
libertine
notwithstanding
his
pretences
owned
that
he
had
paid
a
price
for
the
girl
to
her
aunt
the
betrayed
creature
herself
knew
not
of
this
i
own
i
had
not
patience
to
read
the
letter
through
to
say
the
truth
i
but
run
my
eye
in
a
cursory
manner
over
it
i
was
afraid
of
meeting
at
every
line
something
offensive
to
decency
and
was
the
account
which
in
your
brother
opinion
was
entirely
to
exculpate
mr
faulkland
i
think
i
never
was
so
angry
i
threw
the
letter
to
george
with
indignation
telling
him
i
was
ashamed
to
find
that
he
after
knowing
an
incident
of
this
kind
had
so
little
regard
to
the
honour
of
his
sister
as
to
promote
a
marriage
between
her
and
such
a
rake
he
answered
if
i
kept
you
unmarried
till
i
found
such
a
man
as
should
call
a
rake
you
were
likely
to
live
and
die
a
maid
that
for
his
part
he
was
very
sorry
as
well
for
mr
faulkland
sake
as
yours
he
had
ever
proposed
an
union
which
he
found
was
likely
to
be
overthrown
by
unseasonable
scruples
and
the
gentleman
in
a
violent
passion
flung
out
of
the
room
without
deigning
even
to
take
up
the
letter
which
had
fallen
on
the
floor
i
presume
he
went
directly
to
his
friend
faulkland
and
told
him
all
that
had
passed
for
the
plausible
man
came
to
me
in
the
evening
and
with
looks
full
of
pretended
sorrow
but
guilt
begged
i
would
hear
him
on
the
subject
of
a
letter
which
he
said
he
found
had
unfortunately
prejudiced
me
against
him
to
be
sure
he
was
prepared
and
had
with
george
help
contrived
an
artful
story
to
impose
on
me
he
took
me
unawares
but
i
was
resolved
not
to
give
him
the
advantage
of
arguments
but
proceed
to
ask
him
a
few
plain
questions
i
therefore
cut
him
short
at
once
by
saying
mr
faulkland
i
am
extremely
concerned
and
shocked
at
what
has
happened
i
will
say
but
a
few
words
to
you
and
desire
to
hear
nothing
more
than
answers
to
my
questions
he
bowed
and
remained
silent
i
then
asked
him
taking
the
young
lady
letter
out
of
my
pocket
whether
that
was
from
the
same
person
of
whom
he
had
written
an
account
to
my
son
whilst
he
was
at
bath
he
answered
it
is
madam
and
i
hoped
from
that
letter
which
i
find
sir
george
has
shewn
you
you
would
be
induced
to
believe
that
i
never
formed
a
thought
of
injuring
that
young
lady
till
some
unfortunate
circumstances
combined
and
suddenly
surprized
me
into
the
commission
of
a
fault
that
has
made
us
both
unhappy
sir
said
i
i
do
pretend
to
know
people
hearts
i
can
only
judge
of
them
from
their
actions
you
acknowlege
that
she
was
a
fine
young
woman
and
you
believe
innocent
what
excuse
can
you
offer
for
being
her
destroyer
dear
madam
do
use
so
severe
an
expression
sir
i
can
use
no
other
how
can
you
extenuate
the
fault
by
which
you
merit
so
severe
an
appellation
to
a
lady
of
your
rigid
delicacy
madam
said
he
perhaps
what
youth
could
offer
in
extenuation
of
the
fault
might
appear
but
a
weak
plea
yet
is
most
certain
that
i
was
surprized
into
the
fatal
error
i
am
under
no
promises
no
ties
no
engagements
whatsoever
to
the
lady
no
ties
sir
interrupting
him
is
your
own
honour
no
tie
upon
you
supposing
you
free
from
any
other
obligation
you
see
the
consequence
of
this
fatal
error
as
you
call
it
here
is
a
young
person
of
fashion
perhaps
i
do
enquire
who
she
is
but
she
seems
to
have
had
no
mean
education
who
is
likely
to
bring
a
child
into
the
world
to
the
disgrace
of
herself
and
her
family
on
you
sir
she
charges
her
dishonour
and
mentions
your
marrying
another
as
the
blow
which
is
to
complete
her
ruin
mr
faulkland
is
not
all
this
truth
be
so
good
as
to
give
me
a
direct
answer
madam
i
can
not
deny
it
you
have
the
proof
of
it
in
your
hands
from
all
that
appears
to
you
i
am
indeed
very
blameable
nay
i
do
not
pretend
to
vindicate
my
folly
but
madam
do
not
aggravate
my
fault
in
your
own
thoughts
by
considering
the
affair
in
a
more
unfavourable
light
than
what
even
her
letter
puts
it
i
conjure
you
madam
to
suffer
sir
george
to
be
my
advocate
on
this
occasion
he
is
acquainted
with
every
particular
of
the
transaction
and
can
give
you
a
detail
that
i
will
not
presume
to
do
be
pleased
sir
replied
i
to
tell
me
what
you
mean
to
do
in
regard
to
this
lady
i
mean
to
do
all
that
i
do
answered
he
i
shall
provide
a
place
of
retreat
for
her
where
she
will
meet
with
the
utmost
care
tenderness
and
respect
and
where
she
may
continue
with
privacy
till
she
is
in
a
condition
to
return
home
again
to
her
friends
you
may
be
sure
madam
as
to
the
rest
i
shall
acquit
myself
consistently
with
honour
that
is
as
much
as
to
say
sir
said
i
that
you
will
take
care
of
the
maintenance
of
your
poor
babe
he
looked
as
if
he
had
a
mind
to
smile
forward
man
but
constrained
it
doubtless
madam
i
shall
do
all
that
is
now
in
my
power
to
do
in
every
circumstance
relating
to
her
i
felt
myself
exceedingly
displeased
with
him
i
was
so
disappointed
in
my
opinion
of
him
that
it
increased
my
resentment
sir
i
proceeded
i
must
inform
you
that
there
is
as
much
in
your
power
as
ever
there
was
you
are
still
unmarried
the
way
is
open
to
you
to
repair
the
mischief
you
have
done
i
will
never
bring
down
the
curses
of
an
injured
maid
upon
my
daughter
head
nor
purchase
her
worldly
prosperity
at
the
expence
of
the
shame
and
sorrow
of
another
woman
for
ought
i
know
as
well
born
as
tenderly
bred
and
till
she
knew
you
perhaps
as
innocent
as
herself
for
heaven
sake
madam
he
cry
do
do
i
beseech
you
pronounce
my
fate
so
hastily
you
must
pardon
me
sir
said
i
if
i
beg
to
hear
no
more
on
this
subject
sir
george
has
already
said
every
thing
you
could
expect
of
your
friend
to
say
in
your
justification
and
more
than
became
him
to
utter
all
i
can
find
by
either
you
or
him
is
that
you
think
the
loss
of
honour
to
a
young
woman
is
a
trifle
which
a
man
is
not
obliged
to
repair
because
truly
he
did
not
to
do
so
this
young
creature
i
understand
is
a
gentlewoman
very
charming
in
her
person
by
your
own
account
one
who
loves
you
tenderly
and
will
shortly
make
you
a
father
is
not
all
this
so
i
grant
it
madam
said
the
criminal
then
sir
what
reason
can
you
urge
in
your
conscience
for
not
doing
her
justice
none
but
your
own
inconstant
inclinations
which
happen
now
to
be
better
pleased
with
another
woman
whom
perhaps
you
might
forsake
in
a
few
months
i
can
not
pretend
to
repeat
to
you
all
he
said
upon
this
last
article
worse
of
course
you
may
be
sure
he
intreated
over
and
over
again
that
i
would
permit
sir
george
to
plead
for
him
i
told
him
that
after
the
facts
he
had
granted
it
was
impossible
that
either
he
or
sir
george
could
make
the
affair
better
that
i
was
very
sorry
to
find
myself
disappointed
in
a
person
of
whom
i
had
conceived
so
high
an
opinion
and
added
that
as
your
illness
made
it
very
improper
to
let
you
know
any
thing
of
the
matter
for
the
present
i
should
take
it
as
a
favour
if
he
would
permit
me
to
retain
the
lady
letter
to
him
for
a
few
days
or
till
you
were
in
a
condition
to
have
the
matter
broke
to
you
in
the
mean
while
i
requested
that
he
would
dispense
with
my
receiving
any
more
visits
from
him
he
said
some
frantic
things
for
the
man
seems
of
a
violent
temper
but
finding
me
peremptory
took
his
leave
with
respect
i
understand
from
sir
george
that
he
flew
directly
down
to
richmond
to
a
little
house
he
has
there
where
he
has
remained
ever
since
but
sends
every
day
to
enquire
after
your
health
sir
george
i
am
sure
sees
him
often
for
he
frequently
goes
out
early
in
the
morning
and
stays
abroad
till
night
the
increase
of
your
illness
from
the
time
i
received
the
last
visit
from
mr
faulkland
to
such
a
degree
as
to
alarm
us
for
your
life
i
suppose
prevented
your
brother
from
reassuming
the
subject
though
i
can
perceive
he
is
full
of
anger
and
vexation
on
the
occasion
you
are
now
my
dear
god
be
praised
in
a
hopeful
way
of
recovery
and
i
expect
that
george
who
has
by
espousing
this
man
interests
so
warmly
very
much
offended
me
that
george
i
say
will
renew
his
sollicitations
in
his
favour
what
do
you
say
my
child
i
should
be
glad
to
know
your
thoughts
with
regard
to
the
part
i
have
acted
as
well
as
with
respect
to
mr
faulkland
conduct
shall
i
own
my
weakness
to
you
my
dear
cecilia
i
was
ready
to
melt
into
tears
my
spirits
exhausted
by
sickness
were
not
proof
against
this
unexpected
blow
a
heavy
sigh
burst
from
my
heart
that
gave
me
a
little
relief
you
know
my
mother
is
rigid
in
her
notions
of
virtue
and
i
was
determined
to
shew
her
that
i
would
endeavour
to
imitate
her
i
therefore
suppressed
the
swelling
passion
in
my
breast
and
with
as
much
composure
as
i
could
assume
told
her
i
thought
she
acted
as
became
her
and
that
with
regard
to
mr
faulkland
my
opinion
of
his
conduct
was
such
that
i
never
desired
to
see
him
more
this
answer
dictated
perhaps
by
female
pride
for
i
will
not
answer
for
the
feelings
of
my
heart
at
that
instant
was
so
agreeable
to
my
mother
that
she
threw
her
arms
about
my
neck
and
kissed
me
several
times
blessing
and
calling
me
by
the
most
endearing
names
at
every
interval
her
tenderness
overcame
me
or
to
deal
with
sincerity
i
believe
i
was
willing
to
make
it
an
excuse
for
weeping
oh
my
dear
mother
cry
i
i
have
need
of
your
indulgence
but
indeed
your
goodness
quite
overpowers
me
my
dear
love
said
she
you
deserve
it
all
and
more
than
it
is
in
your
power
to
shew
you
what
a
blessed
escape
have
you
had
my
sweet
child
of
that
wild
man
little
did
i
think
my
sidney
when
i
told
you
the
story
of
my
first
disappointment
that
a
case
so
parallel
would
soon
be
your
own
with
respect
to
you
and
me
indeed
the
incidents
are
nearly
alike
but
there
is
a
wide
difference
between
the
two
men
my
lover
had
the
grace
to
repent
and
would
have
returned
to
his
first
engagements
if
a
dreadful
malady
had
not
overtaken
him
but
this
graceless
faulkland
persists
in
his
infidelity
and
would
make
you
as
culpable
as
himself
i
own
to
you
daughter
that
the
recollection
of
that
melancholy
event
which
happened
to
me
has
given
me
a
sort
of
horror
at
the
very
thoughts
of
a
union
between
you
and
mr
faulkland
you
remember
the
sad
consequences
which
i
related
to
you
of
an
infidelity
of
this
kind
the
poor
forsaken
woman
died
of
grief
and
the
dishonest
lover
ran
mad
think
of
this
my
child
and
let
it
encourage
you
to
banish
such
an
unworthy
man
from
your
heart
i
was
afraid
your
regard
for
him
might
make
this
a
difficult
task
but
i
rejoice
to
find
your
virtue
is
stronger
than
your
passion
loved
as
well
as
you
but
i
overcame
it
when
i
found
it
a
duty
to
do
so
and
i
see
your
mother
example
is
not
lost
upon
you
the
honest
pride
that
my
mother
endeavoured
to
inspire
me
with
had
a
good
effect
and
kept
up
my
spirits
for
a
time
she
told
me
she
was
sure
that
sir
george
would
quarrel
with
us
both
when
we
came
to
talk
upon
the
subject
of
the
marriage
but
she
was
entirely
easy
as
to
that
now
she
knew
that
sentiments
corresponded
with
her
own
you
know
my
mother
has
ever
been
despotic
in
her
government
of
me
and
had
i
even
been
inclined
to
dissent
from
her
judgment
in
a
matter
of
this
importance
it
would
have
been
to
no
purpose
but
this
was
really
far
from
my
thoughts
i
was
as
much
disgusted
with
mr
faulkland
as
she
was
and
as
heartily
pitied
the
unhappy
young
creature
whom
he
had
undone
you
may
recollect
my
dear
that
my
mother
tho
strictly
nice
in
every
particular
has
a
sort
of
partiality
to
her
own
sex
and
where
there
is
the
least
room
for
it
throws
the
whole
of
the
blame
upon
the
side
who
from
her
own
early
prepossessions
she
is
always
inclined
to
think
are
deceivers
of
women
i
am
not
surprized
at
this
bias
in
her
her
early
disappointment
with
the
attending
circumstances
gave
her
this
impression
she
is
warm
and
sometimes
in
her
attachments
and
yet
it
is
not
always
difficult
to
turn
her
from
them
the
integrity
of
her
own
heart
makes
her
liable
to
be
imposed
on
by
a
plausible
outside
and
yet
the
dear
good
woman
takes
a
sort
of
pride
in
her
sagacity
she
had
admired
and
esteemed
mr
faulkland
prodigiously
her
vexation
was
the
greater
in
finding
her
expectations
disappointed
and
could
i
have
been
so
unjust
to
the
pretensions
of
another
or
so
indelicate
in
regard
to
myself
as
to
have
overlooked
mr
fault
i
knew
my
mother
would
be
inflexible
i
therefore
resolved
in
earnest
to
banish
him
from
my
thoughts
i
found
my
mother
was
mightily
pleased
with
her
own
management
of
the
conversation
she
had
held
with
mr
faulkland
i
think
i
talked
pretty
to
him
said
she
but
there
was
no
other
way
he
is
an
artful
man
and
i
was
resolved
not
to
let
him
wind
me
about
he
would
make
a
merit
of
having
no
upon
the
young
lady
why
possibly
he
did
not
till
he
found
the
poor
soul
was
so
smitten
with
him
that
he
thought
she
would
be
an
easy
prey
sir
george
impudently
insinuated
that
a
man
not
reject
a
lady
upon
these
occasions
i
was
ashamed
to
hint
to
mr
faulkland
at
the
circumstance
of
his
having
actually
paid
a
price
for
the
girl
it
was
too
gross
and
i
think
had
i
mentioned
it
must
have
struck
him
dumb
though
very
likely
he
might
have
had
some
subterfuge
even
for
that
aggravating
part
of
the
story
how
i
am
shock
my
cecilia
to
think
of
this
i
was
glad
my
mother
had
spared
his
confusion
on
this
particular
for
though
probably
as
she
observed
he
had
come
prepared
with
some
evasion
to
this
charge
yet
what
a
mean
figure
must
a
man
make
who
is
reduced
to
disingenuous
shifts
to
excuse
or
palliate
an
action
despicable
as
well
as
wicked
my
brother
came
in
during
our
discourse
to
ask
me
how
i
did
my
mother
answered
his
question
before
i
had
time
to
speak
she
is
pretty
well
thank
god
and
not
likely
to
break
her
heart
though
she
your
friend
mr
faulkland
story
and
she
spoke
it
scornfully
my
brother
said
sidney
are
as
averse
to
mr
faulkland
as
my
mother
is
i
replied
brother
i
wonder
you
can
ask
me
that
question
after
what
you
have
been
just
now
told
i
always
said
answered
he
that
you
did
not
know
the
value
of
the
man
and
now
i
am
convinced
of
it
i
wish
he
had
never
seen
you
i
wish
so
too
said
i
sir
george
walked
about
the
room
and
seemed
vexed
to
death
for
heaven
sake
madam
turning
to
my
mother
now
my
sister
is
tolerably
recovered
suffer
her
to
see
mr
faulkland
let
her
hear
what
he
has
to
say
in
his
own
vindication
i
think
you
may
trust
to
her
honour
and
her
discretion
and
if
the
affair
appears
to
her
in
so
heinous
a
light
as
it
does
to
you
i
will
be
contented
to
give
mr
faulkland
up
but
do
shut
your
own
ears
and
your
daughter
too
against
conviction
sir
you
are
disrespectful
said
my
mother
angrily
dear
brother
i
cry
i
beg
you
will
spare
me
on
this
subject
my
mother
given
me
leave
to
judge
for
myself
she
has
repeated
all
that
you
have
said
and
all
that
mr
faulkland
has
been
able
to
urge
on
the
occasion
and
i
am
sorry
to
tell
you
that
i
think
myself
bound
never
to
have
any
farther
correspondence
with
him
therefore
you
must
excuse
me
for
not
seeing
him
and
so
the
match
is
broke
off
cry
sir
george
said
my
mother
peremptorily
it
is
echoed
i
faintly
why
then
replied
sir
george
and
he
swore
you
will
never
get
such
another
whilst
you
live
a
pretty
figure
you
make
in
the
world
when
you
give
it
for
a
reason
that
you
refused
a
man
after
every
thing
was
concluded
upon
because
truly
you
found
that
he
had
had
an
intrigue
why
sidney
be
so
laugh
at
he
addressed
himself
to
me
though
i
knew
he
meant
the
reproof
for
my
mother
sir
answered
she
neither
your
sister
nor
i
shall
trouble
ourselves
much
about
the
opinion
of
people
who
laugh
at
such
things
you
may
put
the
matter
into
as
ridiculous
a
light
as
you
please
but
this
was
no
common
intrigue
it
was
not
however
you
may
affect
to
speak
of
it
i
do
suppose
of
you
are
but
i
trust
in
heaven
some
are
better
than
others
oh
madam
madam
said
my
brother
if
you
knew
the
world
as
well
do
you
would
think
that
mr
faulkland
is
one
of
the
best
god
forbid
my
mother
answered
coolly
well
well
madam
cry
sir
george
i
see
it
is
to
no
purpose
to
argue
there
are
many
families
of
more
consequence
than
ours
and
ten
times
the
fortune
that
will
be
very
proud
of
alliance
and
will
hardly
make
it
an
objection
to
him
that
he
was
led
into
a
foolish
scrape
by
the
wickedness
of
one
woman
and
the
folly
of
another
if
you
make
my
sister
wait
for
a
husband
till
you
find
a
man
who
never
offended
in
that
way
i
think
mother
you
had
better
take
a
little
boy
from
his
nurse
breed
him
up
under
your
own
eye
and
by
the
time
sidney
is
a
good
motherly
gentlewoman
you
may
give
her
the
baby
to
make
a
of
for
my
own
part
i
am
heartily
sorry
i
ever
people
of
such
nice
scruples
had
better
chuse
for
themselves
but
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
both
faulkland
and
i
are
very
ill
used
i
told
you
said
my
mother
to
me
how
he
would
behave
sir
george
i
desire
you
will
not
distress
your
sister
thus
she
saw
me
sadly
cast
down
i
was
ill
and
weak
if
you
have
no
respect
for
have
a
little
tenderness
for
i
beg
your
pardon
child
said
he
i
did
not
mean
to
distress
you
i
pity
indeed
sidney
i
could
have
cry
at
his
using
that
expression
it
humbles
one
so
madam
to
my
mother
you
shall
be
troubled
no
farther
by
my
friend
or
myself
all
i
shall
say
is
this
that
whenever
my
sister
gets
a
husband
of
your
ladyship
chusing
i
wish
he
may
have
half
the
worth
of
the
poor
rejected
faulkland
my
brother
left
the
room
with
these
words
my
mother
was
downright
in
a
passion
but
soon
cooled
on
his
withdrawing
my
spirits
were
quite
fatigued
and
my
mother
left
me
that
i
might
take
a
little
rest
what
a
strange
alteration
have
a
few
days
produced
our
domestic
peace
broke
in
upon
by
the
unlucky
difference
between
my
mother
and
my
brother
my
near
prospect
of
of
oh
let
me
be
ingenuous
and
say
happiness
vanished
poor
mr
faulkland
do
i
call
him
for
shame
sidney
but
let
the
word
go
i
will
not
blot
it
mr
faulkland
forbid
the
house
myself
harassed
by
a
cruel
disorder
and
hardly
able
to
crawl
out
of
bed
all
this
fallen
on
me
within
these
last
fourteen
black
days
then
i
dread
the
going
abroad
or
seeing
company
i
shall
look
so
silly
for
the
intended
wedding
began
to
be
talked
of
and
the
curiosity
of
people
to
know
the
cause
of
it
being
broke
off
what
wild
guesses
will
be
made
by
some
and
what
lies
invented
by
others
then
the
mirth
of
one
half
of
the
girls
of
my
acquaintance
and
the
provoking
condolements
of
the
other
hand
i
am
fretted
at
the
thoughts
of
it
but
it
can
not
be
helped
i
must
bear
it
all
i
wish
i
were
well
enough
to
get
into
the
country
to
be
out
of
the
reach
of
such
impertinence
i
long
to
know
who
this
girl
is
that
has
been
the
cause
of
all
this
gentlewoman
and
very
pretty
one
that
loves
mr
faulkland
and
will
shortly
make
him
a
thus
my
mother
described
her
to
mr
faulkland
and
he
assented
to
it
oh
fie
fie
mr
faulkland
how
could
you
be
so
cruel
to
how
could
you
use
so
ill
and
sir
george
knew
of
all
this
and
makes
light
of
it
it
is
a
strange
story
my
mother
is
severe
in
her
virtue
but
she
is
in
the
right
my
brother
would
sacrifice
every
consideration
to
aggrandize
his
family
to
make
a
purchase
of
the
unhappy
creature
and
that
without
her
knowlege
too
it
is
horrid
away
away
from
my
thoughts
thou
vile
intruder
return
to
your
bath
mistress
she
has
a
better
right
to
you
than
i
have
she
implores
your
pity
she
has
no
refuge
but
you
and
she
may
be
every
way
preferable
to
me
i
wish
i
knew
her
name
but
what
is
it
to
me
will
never
be
faulkland
ought
perhaps
mr
faulkland
may
be
induced
to
marry
her
when
he
sees
her
in
her
present
interesting
situation
he
says
he
will
provide
a
retreat
for
her
to
be
sure
he
will
have
the
compassion
to
visit
her
and
then
who
knows
what
may
happen
if
i
know
my
own
heart
i
think
i
do
most
sincerely
wish
he
may
make
her
his
wife
but
then
i
would
not
chuse
to
have
it
known
suddenly
that
might
look
as
if
he
forsook
me
for
her
i
own
would
a
little
hurt
my
pride
i
wish
not
the
truth
to
be
known
for
mr
sake
but
then
i
should
not
like
to
have
a
slur
thrown
on
me
i
will
add
no
more
to
this
but
send
the
packet
off
at
all
events
i
think
it
will
find
you
at
paris
my
health
promises
to
return
my
mother
praises
me
and
calls
me
a
heroine
i
begin
to
fancy
myself
one
our
pride
sometimes
stands
in
the
place
of
virtue
sir
george
went
to
richmond
yesterday
we
have
scarce
seen
him
since
the
tift
he
had
with
us
the
other
day
what
strange
creatures
these
men
are
even
the
best
of
them
and
how
light
they
make
of
faults
in
one
another
that
shock
us
but
to
think
of
my
mother
takes
his
behaviour
very
ill
he
staid
all
night
with
his
friend
and
returned
to
town
this
morning
he
only
looked
into
my
room
to
ask
me
how
i
did
my
mother
was
sitting
with
me
i
believe
that
hindered
him
from
coming
in
for
he
looked
as
if
he
wanted
to
speak
to
me
he
bowed
to
my
mother
but
said
not
a
word
he
went
abroad
again
as
soon
as
he
was
dressed
and
did
not
come
in
till
late
i
fear
his
conduct
will
oblige
us
to
separate
for
my
mother
will
not
brook
any
liberties
to
be
taken
with
her
she
hinted
as
much
and
said
she
believed
sir
george
was
tired
of
living
regularly
she
anticipated
the
request
i
intended
to
make
to
her
of
letting
me
go
out
of
town
for
she
said
as
soon
as
i
was
able
i
should
remove
into
the
country
for
a
while
sidney
castle
is
too
long
a
journey
for
me
at
present
to
think
of
undertaking
and
she
talks
of
going
into
essex
on
a
visit
to
lady
grimston
which
we
have
long
promised
her
i
shall
like
this
better
than
going
down
to
wiltshire
where
the
want
of
my
cecilia
would
make
my
old
abode
a
melancholy
place
especially
at
this
juncture
sir
george
continues
sullen
and
cold
to
us
he
never
has
had
an
opportunity
of
saying
any
thing
particular
to
me
since
the
day
he
said
so
much
my
mother
scarce
ever
leaves
me
he
seems
nettled
at
this
i
believe
he
would
endeavour
to
work
on
as
he
knows
the
attempt
would
be
vain
in
regard
to
as
i
am
now
well
enough
to
receive
the
visits
of
our
intimate
acquaintance
i
am
never
without
company
i
am
really
in
pretty
good
spirits
and
bear
my
disappointment
as
i
told
you
i
would
very
handsomely
i
never
hear
mr
faulkland
name
mentioned
no
more
than
if
such
a
man
did
not
exist
we
are
to
set
out
for
lady
grimston
house
on
tuesday
it
is
but
twenty
miles
from
london
and
i
am
already
strong
enough
to
bear
a
longer
journey
my
mother
told
sir
george
that
if
he
liked
it
the
house
we
are
now
in
was
at
his
service
during
her
time
of
it
of
which
there
are
some
months
to
come
for
she
said
she
meant
to
go
directly
home
from
essex
sir
george
thanked
her
but
did
not
say
whether
he
would
accept
of
her
offer
or
not
i
have
been
obliged
to
turn
away
my
poor
ellen
she
was
so
imprudent
as
to
receive
a
letter
for
me
from
mr
faulkland
man
contrary
to
my
mother
express
commands
she
brought
it
to
me
and
i
gave
it
to
my
mother
unopened
who
put
it
directly
into
the
fire
without
reading
it
and
told
me
it
would
oblige
her
if
i
would
part
with
the
servant
who
had
presumed
to
take
it
after
her
prohibition
i
instantly
obeyed
and
have
just
discharged
her
i
should
have
a
sad
loss
of
her
only
i
am
in
hopes
of
having
her
place
well
supplied
by
an
old
acquaintance
and
of
ours
poor
patty
main
her
father
is
dead
and
she
is
obliged
to
go
to
service
for
he
has
left
a
widow
with
six
children
the
eldest
son
you
remember
served
his
time
to
his
father
and
is
just
now
setting
out
in
business
but
a
young
surgeon
in
a
country
town
must
take
some
time
to
establish
himself
though
he
is
a
very
worthy
youth
and
i
hear
clever
in
his
profession
patty
came
to
town
last
week
with
a
lady
from
our
neighbourhood
who
applied
to
my
mother
to
recommend
the
girl
to
wait
on
some
person
of
fashion
my
mother
has
been
looking
out
for
a
suitable
place
for
her
but
she
told
me
today
she
thought
i
could
not
do
better
than
take
her
to
myself
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
have
her
for
she
is
an
amiable
young
woman
we
go
out
of
town
at
seven
morning
as
we
are
to
dine
at
and
purpose
going
at
our
leisure
i
will
steal
a
few
minutes
from
sleep
though
it
is
now
very
late
to
give
you
a
short
scene
which
passed
in
my
chamber
about
an
hour
ago
sir
george
who
according
to
his
late
custom
had
been
abroad
all
day
came
into
my
room
where
my
mother
and
i
were
sitting
together
he
asked
us
did
we
hold
our
purpose
of
going
out
of
town
next
day
yes
certainly
my
mother
said
and
you
intend
going
from
lady
grimston
to
sidney
castle
we
do
then
madam
to
my
mother
as
it
is
the
last
trouble
you
are
likely
to
have
from
mr
faulkland
i
hope
you
will
not
refuse
to
read
this
letter
which
he
has
sent
you
and
he
took
one
out
of
his
pocket
and
presented
it
to
her
she
did
not
make
an
offer
to
receive
it
but
answered
sir
george
it
is
to
no
purpose
for
mr
faulkland
to
sollicit
me
you
know
i
do
easily
alter
my
resolutions
when
once
they
are
fixed
he
has
given
himself
an
unnecessary
trouble
pray
excuse
me
it
was
not
handsome
of
him
to
write
to
my
daughter
after
he
knew
my
sentiments
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
fresh
sollicitations
madam
said
my
brother
i
knew
enough
of
your
and
he
spoke
the
word
firmness
reluctantly
as
if
he
would
rather
have
used
another
perhaps
less
respectful
term
i
knew
enough
to
assure
faulkland
there
was
not
the
least
hope
left
for
him
and
though
i
do
not
know
the
subject
of
that
letter
i
can
venture
to
assure
you
it
is
not
intended
to
move
you
in
favour
of
his
pretensions
this
he
declared
to
me
before
i
would
take
the
letter
from
him
but
what
puts
it
past
doubt
is
that
he
set
out
this
very
evening
from
london
in
order
to
embark
for
germany
i
could
not
help
breathing
a
sigh
when
sir
george
said
this
but
no
body
heard
me
he
still
held
the
letter
in
his
hand
and
again
offered
it
to
my
mother
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
it
madam
i
presume
it
may
be
no
more
than
to
take
a
civil
leave
of
you
i
wish
him
well
said
my
mother
taking
the
letter
if
that
be
all
what
he
says
may
keep
cold
and
she
put
it
into
her
pocket
without
opening
this
being
the
eve
of
our
journey
some
little
domestic
matters
which
my
mother
had
to
settle
called
her
out
of
the
room
sir
george
took
that
opportunity
to
ask
me
whether
my
mother
had
shewed
me
the
letter
which
he
had
received
from
mr
faulkland
while
he
was
at
bath
relative
to
that
cursed
affair
as
he
called
it
i
told
him
my
mother
had
repeated
great
part
of
the
contents
of
it
to
me
and
that
the
principal
observation
she
had
made
was
not
favourable
to
on
account
of
his
being
made
the
confidant
of
such
an
affair
i
am
very
sorry
for
your
sake
sidney
said
he
that
our
mother
is
of
so
inflexible
a
temper
you
have
lost
by
it
what
you
will
have
reason
to
regret
as
long
as
you
live
such
amazing
obstinacy
such
unaccountable
perverseness
i
do
not
want
to
shake
your
filial
obedience
but
i
for
my
own
part
think
that
nothing
but
infatuation
can
account
for
your
mother
conduct
does
she
want
a
man
without
passions
or
have
filled
your
head
with
such
chimærical
notions
as
to
i
interrupted
him
for
my
brother
is
not
always
nice
in
his
choice
of
words
dear
sir
george
say
no
more
i
am
very
well
contented
as
i
am
i
will
not
increase
your
uneasiness
said
he
by
telling
you
what
faulkland
has
suffered
on
this
occasion
if
ever
love
was
carried
to
adoration
it
was
in
the
breast
of
that
generous
charming
fellow
but
you
have
lost
him
and
i
have
lost
him
thanks
to
my
wise
scrupulous
mother
for
that
i
begged
of
him
to
drop
the
subject
my
mother
came
in
to
us
again
sir
george
bid
us
good
night
and
wished
us
a
good
journey
the
parting
was
cool
enough
i
am
glad
however
there
is
not
a
total
rupture
i
believe
he
will
continue
in
our
house
in
town
for
a
time
at
least
patty
main
who
gladly
accepted
of
the
offer
of
my
service
came
home
to
me
this
evening
she
is
grown
very
tall
and
genteel
i
hardly
know
how
to
treat
her
as
a
servant
but
the
good
girl
is
so
humble
that
she
does
all
in
her
power
to
make
me
forget
that
i
ever
knew
her
in
a
better
situation
but
in
this
she
fails
of
her
purpose
for
it
only
serves
to
remind
me
the
more
strongly
of
it
she
is
so
ready
and
so
handy
that
she
does
twenty
little
offices
that
do
not
belong
to
her
place
and
which
are
not
expected
of
her
my
mother
is
exceedingly
pleased
with
her
and
says
it
is
such
a
happiness
to
have
about
me
a
young
person
virtuously
brought
up
that
she
almost
considers
her
as
one
of
the
family
august
we
arrived
here
yesterday
and
met
a
most
friendly
reception
from
the
lady
of
this
mansion
but
before
i
say
any
more
of
her
i
will
hasten
to
a
more
interesting
subject
i
have
got
mr
faulkland
letter
to
my
mother
she
has
just
put
it
into
my
hands
and
while
she
walks
in
the
garden
with
lady
grimston
i
will
make
haste
to
transcribe
it
thus
it
is
madam
i
submit
to
the
sentence
you
have
passed
on
me
i
am
miserable
but
do
not
presume
to
expostulate
i
purpose
leaving
england
directly
but
would
wish
if
possible
a
little
to
mitigate
the
severity
of
my
lot
to
convince
you
that
the
unhappy
rejected
man
who
aspired
to
the
honour
of
being
your
is
not
quite
such
a
criminal
as
he
now
appears
to
you
to
sir
george
friendship
i
know
i
am
much
indebted
for
endeavouring
to
vindicate
me
it
was
not
in
his
power
it
was
not
in
my
own
for
you
saw
all
which
i
in
unreserved
freedom
wrote
to
him
on
the
subject
of
my
acquaintance
with
miss
i
have
but
one
resource
left
perhaps
madam
you
will
think
it
a
strange
one
to
the
lady
herself
i
must
appeal
she
will
do
me
justice
and
i
am
sure
will
be
ready
to
acknowlege
that
i
am
no
betrayer
of
innocence
no
breaker
of
promises
that
i
was
surprized
into
the
commission
of
a
fault
for
which
i
have
paid
so
dear
a
price
her
testimony
madam
may
perhaps
have
some
weight
with
you
though
i
propose
nothing
more
by
it
than
that
you
may
think
of
me
with
less
detestation
you
have
banished
me
from
your
presence
i
am
a
voluntary
exile
from
my
country
and
from
my
friends
submit
to
the
chastisement
and
would
do
anything
to
expiate
my
offence
against
you
and
miss
bidulph
there
is
but
command
which
you
can
possibly
lay
on
me
to
which
i
would
not
pay
a
perfect
and
ready
obedience
but
that
act
perhaps
is
the
one
which
would
make
me
appear
worthy
of
your
esteem
the
lady
whom
it
has
been
my
ill
fate
to
render
unhappy
and
by
whom
i
am
made
unutterably
so
will
ere
long
come
to
a
house
at
putney
which
i
have
taken
on
purpose
for
her
i
have
placed
in
it
my
housekeeper
a
grave
worthy
woman
under
whose
care
she
will
be
safe
and
attended
with
that
secresy
and
tenderness
which
her
condition
requires
i
have
written
to
her
a
faithful
account
of
every
thing
relative
to
my
alliance
with
your
family
and
the
occasion
of
the
treaty
being
broken
off
as
she
must
by
this
means
know
that
your
ladyship
is
acquainted
with
her
story
i
have
told
her
that
perhaps
you
might
from
the
interest
you
took
in
her
misfortune
be
induced
to
see
her
in
her
retirement
let
me
therefore
conjure
you
madam
by
that
pious
zeal
which
governs
all
your
actions
and
by
the
love
you
bear
that
daughter
so
deservedly
dear
to
you
to
take
compassion
on
this
young
lady
she
has
no
friends
nor
any
acquaintance
in
this
part
of
the
kingdom
her
situation
will
require
the
comfort
of
society
and
perhaps
the
advice
of
wisdom
it
will
be
an
act
worthy
of
your
humanity
to
shew
some
countenance
to
her
i
think
she
will
be
in
very
good
hands
with
the
honest
woman
who
waits
her
coming
but
if
any
thing
should
happen
otherwise
than
well
it
would
make
me
doubly
wretched
to
one
who
has
no
resources
of
contentment
in
her
own
bosom
solitude
can
not
be
a
friend
this
i
fear
may
be
the
lady
case
and
this
makes
me
with
the
more
earnestness
urge
my
request
to
you
forgive
me
madam
for
the
liberty
i
take
with
you
a
liberty
which
though
i
confess
it
needs
an
apology
yet
is
it
at
the
same
time
a
proof
of
the
confidence
i
have
in
you
which
i
hope
will
not
affront
either
your
candour
or
your
virtue
if
you
will
condescend
to
grant
this
request
i
shall
obtain
the
two
wishes
at
present
most
material
to
my
peace
the
one
to
secure
to
the
lady
a
compassionate
friend
already
inclined
to
espouse
her
cause
the
other
to
put
it
in
your
power
to
be
satisfied
from
the
lady
own
mouth
of
the
truth
of
what
i
have
asserted
i
trust
to
her
generosity
to
deal
openly
on
this
occasion
i
wish
you
and
miss
bidulph
every
blessing
that
heaven
can
bestow
and
am
with
great
respect
madam
your
most
obedient
humble
servant
orlando
faulkland
the
lady
will
go
by
the
name
of
mrs
jefferis
you
will
pardon
me
for
not
having
mentioned
her
i
never
yet
told
it
even
to
sir
george
but
i
presume
she
will
make
no
secret
of
it
to
you
if
you
honour
her
with
a
visit
poor
orlando
unhappy
miss
b
i
could
name
a
third
person
that
is
not
neither
what
a
pity
it
is
that
so
many
good
qualities
should
be
blotted
by
imperfections
how
tender
is
his
compassion
for
this
poor
girl
how
ingenuous
his
conduct
but
still
he
flies
from
her
i
fear
she
can
never
hope
to
recover
him
there
is
but
thing
he
says
which
would
not
do
the
only
act
perhaps
by
which
he
could
make
himself
appear
worthy
of
my
mother
the
meaning
of
this
but
too
plainly
shews
him
determined
against
marrying
miss
i
do
know
any
thing
else
which
would
reconcile
my
mother
to
him
i
make
no
doubt
of
her
complying
with
mr
faulkland
request
in
seeing
the
lady
she
is
very
compassionate
particularly
to
her
own
sex
what
a
indeed
is
this
of
mr
faulkland
to
appeal
to
the
lady
herself
what
am
i
to
judge
from
it
but
that
the
unfortunate
victim
ignorant
of
the
treachery
that
was
practised
against
her
by
her
wicked
aunt
and
that
her
destroyer
paid
a
for
her
dishonour
exculpates
him
from
the
worst
part
of
the
guilt
and
perhaps
poor
easy
creature
blames
her
own
weakness
only
for
the
error
which
a
concealed
train
of
cunning
and
perfidy
might
have
led
her
into
but
even
supposing
miss
were
generous
and
candid
enough
and
great
indeed
must
be
her
candour
and
generosity
to
justify
this
guilty
man
what
would
it
avail
did
not
my
mother
tell
me
she
conceived
a
of
horror
at
the
bare
idea
of
an
union
between
mr
faulkland
and
this
arises
from
the
strong
impression
made
on
her
by
the
unlucky
event
which
blasted
her
own
early
love
strong
and
early
prejudices
are
almost
insurmountable
my
mother
piety
genuine
and
rational
as
it
is
is
notwithstanding
a
little
tinctured
with
superstition
it
was
the
error
of
her
education
and
her
good
sense
has
not
been
able
to
surmount
it
so
that
i
now
the
universe
would
not
induce
her
to
change
her
resolution
in
regard
to
mr
faulkland
she
thinks
he
to
marry
miss
and
she
will
think
so
i
wish
he
would
for
i
am
sure
he
never
can
be
mine
the
bell
rings
for
breakfast
i
must
run
down
my
mother
came
up
to
dress
just
now
and
stepped
into
my
room
i
returned
her
the
letter
and
she
asked
me
what
i
thought
of
mr
faulkland
request
madam
you
are
a
better
judge
of
the
propriety
of
it
than
i
am
i
shall
have
no
objection
to
seeing
the
unhappy
lady
said
she
since
it
seems
he
has
apprised
her
of
my
knowlege
of
her
affairs
i
am
glad
he
has
the
grace
to
shew
even
so
much
compassion
for
her
perhaps
it
may
be
the
beginning
of
repentance
and
time
may
work
a
thorough
reformation
in
him
if
god
spares
him
his
life
and
his
you
see
which
way
my
good
mother
thoughts
tended
i
did
not
she
added
intend
to
return
to
london
again
but
this
occasion
i
think
calls
upon
me
and
i
believe
i
shall
go
for
a
while
in
order
to
see
and
comfort
this
poor
young
creature
she
can
not
yet
be
near
lying
in
and
i
suppose
she
will
not
come
to
the
house
mr
faulkland
speaks
of
till
she
can
no
longer
remain
undiscovered
at
home
so
that
a
month
or
two
hence
will
be
full
soon
enough
for
me
to
think
of
going
to
town
i
saw
my
mother
rested
her
compliance
with
mr
faulkland
request
merely
on
one
point
that
of
compassion
to
the
girl
as
for
the
other
motive
said
she
the
hearing
him
justified
from
the
own
i
am
not
such
a
novice
in
those
matters
but
that
i
know
when
a
deluding
man
has
once
got
an
ascendency
over
a
young
creature
he
can
coax
her
into
any
thing
too
much
truth
i
doubt
there
is
in
this
observation
of
my
mother
but
it
is
time
to
say
something
of
lady
grimston
my
cecilia
has
never
seen
her
though
i
believe
she
has
often
heard
my
mother
speak
of
her
they
are
nearly
of
an
age
and
much
of
the
same
cast
of
thinking
though
with
this
difference
that
lady
grimston
is
extravagantly
rigid
in
her
notions
and
precise
in
her
manner
she
has
been
a
widow
for
many
years
and
lives
upon
a
large
jointure
at
with
as
much
regularity
and
solemnity
as
you
would
see
in
a
monastery
her
servants
are
all
antediluvians
i
believe
her
coach
horses
are
fifty
years
of
age
and
the
very
is
as
grey
as
a
badger
she
herself
who
in
her
youth
never
have
been
handsome
renders
herself
still
a
more
unpleasing
figure
by
the
oddity
of
her
dress
you
would
take
her
for
a
lady
of
charles
the
first
court
at
least
she
is
always
dressed
out
i
believe
she
sleeps
in
her
cloaths
for
she
comes
down
ruffled
and
towered
and
flounced
and
fardingal
even
to
breakfast
my
mother
has
a
high
opinion
of
her
and
says
she
more
of
the
than
any
one
of
her
acquaintance
it
may
be
so
but
it
must
be
of
the
old
world
for
lady
grimston
has
not
been
ten
miles
from
her
seat
these
thirty
years
is
nine
years
since
my
mother
and
she
met
before
and
there
was
a
world
of
compliments
passed
between
them
though
i
am
sure
they
were
sincerely
glad
to
see
each
other
for
they
seem
to
be
very
fond
they
were
companions
in
youth
that
season
wherein
the
most
durable
friendships
are
contracted
i
believe
her
really
a
very
good
woman
she
is
pious
and
charitable
and
does
abundance
of
good
things
in
her
neighbourhood
though
i
can
not
say
i
think
her
amiable
there
is
an
austerity
about
her
that
keeps
me
in
awe
notwithstanding
that
she
is
extremely
obliging
to
me
and
told
my
mother
i
to
make
a
fine
think
of
such
a
compliment
to
one
of
almost
nineteen
my
mother
and
she
call
one
another
by
their
christian
names
and
you
would
smile
to
hear
the
two
old
ladies
begging
their
pardons
and
one
another
this
accounts
to
me
for
lady
grimston
thinking
still
a
child
for
i
suppose
she
considers
herself
not
much
past
though
to
do
her
justice
she
has
not
a
scrap
of
it
in
her
behaviour
all
our
motions
here
are
as
regular
as
the
clock
the
family
rise
at
six
we
are
summoned
to
breakfast
at
eight
at
ten
a
venerable
congregation
are
assembled
to
prayers
which
an
ancient
clergyman
who
is
curate
of
the
parish
and
her
ladyship
chaplain
gives
us
daily
then
the
old
horses
are
put
to
the
old
coach
and
my
lady
with
her
guests
if
they
chuse
it
take
an
airing
always
going
and
returning
by
the
same
road
and
driving
precisely
to
the
same
and
no
farther
at
half
an
hour
after
twelve
in
a
hall
large
enough
to
entertain
a
corporation
we
sit
down
to
dinner
my
lady
has
a
grace
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
long
and
we
are
waited
on
by
four
truly
venerable
footmen
for
she
likes
state
the
afternoon
we
may
dispose
of
as
we
please
at
least
it
is
a
liberty
i
am
indulged
in
and
i
generally
spend
my
time
in
the
garden
or
my
own
chamber
till
i
have
notice
given
me
of
supper
being
on
the
table
where
we
are
treated
with
the
same
ceremonials
as
at
dinner
at
ten
exactly
the
instant
the
clock
strikes
the
first
stroke
my
lady
rises
with
great
solemnity
and
wishes
us
a
good
night
you
can
not
expect
in
such
a
house
as
this
is
my
dear
that
i
can
be
furnished
with
materials
to
give
you
much
variety
indeed
these
four
last
days
have
been
so
exactly
the
same
in
every
particular
excepting
that
the
dishes
at
dinner
and
supper
were
changed
that
i
had
resolved
to
hang
up
my
pen
till
i
quitted
or
at
least
resign
it
to
patty
and
let
her
plod
on
and
tell
you
how
the
wind
blew
such
a
day
what
sort
of
a
mantua
lady
grimston
had
on
such
a
day
though
by
the
way
it
is
always
the
same
always
tissue
what
the
great
dog
barked
at
at
such
an
hour
and
what
the
old
parrot
said
at
such
a
time
the
house
and
the
garden
i
have
exhausted
my
descriptive
faculties
on
already
though
they
are
neither
of
them
worth
describing
and
i
was
beginning
to
despair
of
matter
to
furnish
out
a
quarter
of
an
entertainment
when
the
scene
began
to
brighten
a
little
this
auspicious
day
by
the
arrival
of
a
coach
full
of
visitors
these
were
no
other
than
a
venerable
dean
who
is
the
minister
of
our
parish
his
lady
and
daughter
and
a
mr
arnold
a
gentleman
who
is
a
distant
relation
of
lady
grimston
he
has
a
house
in
this
neighbourhood
and
is
just
come
to
an
estate
by
the
death
of
his
elder
brother
this
visit
has
given
me
hopes
that
i
may
now
and
then
have
a
chance
for
seeing
a
human
face
besides
the
antiques
of
the
family
and
those
which
are
depicted
on
the
arras
though
not
to
disparage
the
people
they
were
all
agreeable
enough
in
their
different
ways
the
old
dean
is
good
humoured
and
polite
i
mean
the
true
politeness
that
of
the
heart
which
dictates
the
most
obliging
things
in
so
frank
a
manner
that
they
have
not
the
least
appearance
of
flattery
being
very
near
sighted
he
put
on
a
pair
of
spectacles
to
look
at
me
and
turning
to
mr
arnold
with
a
vivacity
that
would
have
become
he
repeated
an
air
and
a
face
a
shape
and
a
grace
the
young
man
smiled
his
assent
and
my
mother
looked
so
delighted
that
the
dean
compliment
pleased
for
sake
lady
grimston
who
is
passionately
fond
of
musick
has
a
very
pretty
organ
in
one
of
her
chambers
mr
arnold
was
requested
to
give
us
a
lesson
on
it
which
he
very
readily
obliged
us
with
he
plays
ravishingly
the
creature
made
me
envious
he
touched
it
so
admirably
i
had
taken
a
sort
of
dislike
to
him
when
he
first
came
in
i
can
not
tell
you
why
or
wherefore
but
this
accomplishment
has
reconciled
me
so
to
him
that
i
am
half
in
love
with
him
i
hope
we
shall
see
him
often
he
is
really
excellent
on
this
instrument
and
you
know
how
fond
i
am
of
musick
this
packet
is
already
so
large
that
i
am
sure
it
will
frighten
you
i
will
therefore
send
it
off
before
i
increase
it
especially
as
i
am
now
so
much
in
the
way
that
i
ought
out
of
policy
to
make
a
break
in
my
narrative
in
order
to
encourage
you
to
read
it
positively
if
things
do
not
mend
and
that
considerably
too
patty
shall
keep
the
journal
for
i
find
myself
already
disposed
to
sleep
over
it
i
have
looked
over
what
patty
has
writ
for
the
five
last
days
upon
my
word
she
is
a
very
good
journalist
as
well
as
amanuensis
and
she
has
given
you
to
the
full
as
good
an
account
of
matters
and
things
as
i
could
my
time
passes
rather
more
tolerably
than
i
expected
the
dean
family
seem
to
have
broke
the
solitary
that
hung
over
the
house
and
we
have
company
you
see
every
day
mr
arnold
never
fails
i
always
make
him
play
he
is
very
obliging
and
if
he
were
not
good
natured
i
should
tire
him
i
have
had
a
letter
from
sir
george
he
mentions
not
mr
faulkland
i
too
am
endeavouring
to
forget
him
when
my
mother
goes
to
london
i
will
try
to
prevail
on
her
to
let
me
go
down
to
i
have
no
inclination
to
go
to
town
and
less
to
stay
here
we
are
to
have
a
concert
at
mr
arnold
house
my
lively
good
old
dean
touches
the
bass
viol
his
daughter
sings
prettily
i
am
to
bear
my
part
too
so
that
we
begin
to
grow
a
little
sociable
are
you
not
tired
of
my
grimston
journal
my
cecilia
day
after
day
rolls
on
and
the
same
dull
repetition
lady
grimston
the
dean
and
mr
arnold
perpetually
there
is
no
bearing
this
you
cry
well
but
here
is
a
new
personage
arrived
to
diversity
the
scene
a
little
lady
grimston
daughter
a
sweet
woman
but
her
mother
does
not
seem
fond
of
her
it
amazes
me
for
she
is
perfectly
amiable
both
in
temper
and
person
she
is
a
widow
of
about
eight
and
twenty
lady
grimston
appears
to
treat
her
with
a
distance
very
unmaternal
and
the
poor
young
woman
seems
so
humbled
that
i
pity
her
she
is
come
but
on
a
visit
and
we
shall
lose
her
in
a
week
for
which
i
am
very
sorry
as
i
have
taken
a
fancy
to
her
poor
mrs
vere
that
is
the
name
of
lady
grimston
daughter
i
can
now
give
you
the
cause
of
her
mother
coldness
to
her
i
had
it
from
herself
she
told
me
her
little
history
this
evening
in
the
garden
with
a
frankness
that
charmed
me
how
happy
you
are
dear
miss
bidulph
said
she
you
seem
to
be
blessed
with
one
of
the
tenderest
of
parents
i
am
indeed
i
answered
she
is
one
of
the
best
of
mothers
and
the
best
of
women
she
sighed
and
a
tear
started
into
her
eye
i
too
was
happy
once
said
she
when
my
indulgent
father
lived
i
hope
madam
lady
grimston
is
to
you
what
my
good
mother
is
to
me
she
shook
her
head
no
miss
bidulph
it
must
be
but
too
obvious
to
you
that
she
is
not
i
should
not
have
introduced
the
subject
if
the
cold
severity
of
her
looks
were
not
so
apparent
that
you
must
have
taken
notice
of
them
my
mother
is
undoubtedly
a
very
good
woman
and
you
may
naturally
suppose
that
my
conduct
has
been
such
as
to
deserve
her
frowns
i
will
therefore
tell
you
my
melancholy
though
short
story
it
is
now
about
twelve
years
since
mr
vere
paid
his
addresses
to
me
he
was
the
eldest
son
of
a
gentleman
of
family
and
fortune
who
then
lived
in
this
country
i
was
about
sixteen
and
the
darling
of
my
father
who
was
perhaps
the
more
indulgent
to
me
as
he
knew
my
mother
severity
mr
vere
was
but
two
years
older
than
myself
and
a
childish
courtship
had
gone
on
for
some
time
between
us
before
it
was
suspected
by
any
body
and
to
say
the
truth
before
i
was
well
aware
of
the
consequences
myself
it
happened
that
an
elderly
gentleman
of
a
great
estate
just
at
that
time
saw
and
liked
me
and
directly
made
proposals
to
my
mother
as
she
was
very
well
known
to
hold
the
reins
of
government
in
her
family
this
offer
i
suppose
was
advantageous
for
she
immediately
consulted
my
father
upon
it
or
rather
gave
him
to
understand
that
she
meant
to
dispose
of
her
daughter
in
marriage
my
father
who
had
no
objection
to
the
match
told
her
he
was
very
well
satisfied
provided
i
liked
the
gentleman
but
said
he
hoped
she
would
not
think
of
putting
any
force
on
my
inclinations
my
eldest
sister
had
been
married
some
time
before
by
my
mother
sole
authority
and
quite
contrary
to
her
own
liking
the
marriage
had
not
turned
out
happily
and
my
father
was
resolved
not
to
have
me
sacrificed
in
the
same
way
my
mother
told
him
she
was
sorry
he
had
such
romantic
notions
as
to
think
a
girl
of
my
age
capable
of
having
any
ideas
of
preference
for
one
man
more
than
another
that
she
took
it
for
granted
i
had
never
presumed
to
entertain
a
thought
of
any
man
as
yet
and
supposed
her
precepts
had
not
been
so
far
thrown
away
upon
me
as
that
i
could
let
it
enter
into
my
head
that
any
thing
but
parental
authority
was
to
guide
me
in
my
choice
my
father
from
the
gentleness
of
his
nature
had
been
so
accustomed
to
acquiesce
that
he
made
no
other
reply
than
to
bid
my
mother
use
her
discretion
he
came
directly
to
me
notwithstanding
and
told
me
what
had
passed
it
was
then
for
the
first
time
that
i
discovered
i
loved
mr
vere
i
burst
into
tears
and
clinging
round
my
father
neck
begged
of
him
to
save
me
from
my
mother
rigour
my
gesture
and
words
were
too
passionate
for
him
not
to
perceive
that
there
was
something
more
at
my
heart
than
mere
dislike
of
the
old
man
he
charged
me
to
deal
sincerely
i
loved
him
too
well
and
was
myself
too
frank
to
do
otherwise
in
short
i
confessed
my
inclination
for
mr
vere
and
his
affection
for
me
though
my
kind
father
chid
me
gently
for
admitting
a
lover
without
his
or
my
mother
approbation
yet
at
the
same
time
he
told
me
he
would
endeavour
to
dissuade
her
from
prosecuting
the
other
match
though
he
could
wish
he
said
i
would
try
to
bring
myself
to
accept
of
it
adding
he
was
afraid
my
mother
would
be
much
incensed
by
a
denial
my
mother
was
fond
of
grandeur
and
would
not
like
to
have
me
marry
any
one
who
could
not
at
once
make
me
mistress
of
a
fine
house
and
a
fine
equipage
which
i
knew
i
must
not
expect
to
be
the
case
with
mr
vere
his
father
had
several
children
and
was
very
frugal
in
his
temper
besides
as
he
was
but
of
the
middle
age
and
of
a
very
healthy
constitution
his
son
prospect
of
possessing
the
estate
was
to
all
human
appearance
at
a
very
great
distance
these
discouragements
however
did
not
hinder
me
from
indulging
my
wishes
my
father
tenderness
was
the
foundation
on
which
i
built
my
hopes
i
told
mr
vere
the
designs
of
one
parent
and
the
kind
condescension
of
the
other
emboldened
by
this
information
he
ventured
to
disclose
his
love
to
my
father
begging
his
interest
with
my
mother
in
his
favour
he
had
a
great
kindness
for
the
youth
and
was
so
fond
of
me
that
he
would
readily
have
consented
to
my
happiness
if
the
fear
of
disobliging
my
mother
had
not
checked
him
he
represented
to
her
in
the
mildest
manner
the
utter
dislike
i
had
expressed
of
the
proposed
match
and
conjured
her
not
to
insist
on
it
my
mother
unused
to
be
controuled
was
filled
with
resentment
both
against
him
and
me
she
said
he
encouraged
me
in
my
disobedience
and
that
if
he
did
not
unite
his
authority
to
hers
in
order
to
compel
me
to
marry
the
gentleman
she
approved
of
it
would
make
a
total
breach
between
them
my
good
father
who
loved
my
mother
exceedingly
was
alarmed
at
this
menace
unwilling
to
come
to
extremities
either
with
her
or
me
he
was
at
a
loss
how
to
act
his
paternal
love
at
length
prevailed
and
he
determined
at
all
events
to
save
me
from
the
violence
which
he
knew
would
be
put
upon
my
heart
my
mother
had
never
condescended
to
talk
to
me
on
the
subject
she
thought
my
immediate
obedience
ought
to
have
followed
the
bare
knowlege
of
her
will
she
forbad
me
her
sight
and
charged
me
never
to
appear
before
her
till
i
came
with
a
determination
to
obey
her
however
severe
this
prohibition
was
i
yielded
to
it
with
the
less
reluctance
as
my
father
tender
love
made
me
amends
for
my
harshness
perhaps
had
she
vouchsafed
to
reason
a
little
with
me
tempering
her
arguments
with
a
motherly
kindness
she
would
have
found
me
as
flexible
as
she
could
wish
but
the
course
she
took
had
a
very
contrary
effect
i
thought
myself
persecuted
and
that
it
was
for
the
honour
of
my
love
to
persevere
on
the
other
hand
my
father
secret
indulgence
encouraged
me
in
the
sentiments
i
entertained
and
i
now
determined
not
only
to
refuse
my
old
lover
but
to
have
my
young
one
my
mother
had
given
me
a
stated
time
in
which
i
was
to
come
to
a
resolution
and
if
i
did
not
at
the
expiration
of
it
acquiesce
i
was
to
be
pronounced
a
reprobate
and
to
be
no
more
considered
as
her
child
in
this
emergency
i
had
recourse
to
my
father
i
told
him
there
was
nothing
which
i
was
not
ready
to
suffer
rather
than
marry
the
man
i
hated
my
greatest
affliction
was
the
uneasiness
i
saw
him
endure
on
my
account
for
my
mother
reproached
him
daily
with
my
obstinacy
my
father
said
he
thought
the
alternative
offered
by
my
mother
was
to
be
avoided
but
in
one
way
and
that
was
by
marrying
mr
vere
for
added
he
when
she
finds
you
resolute
in
your
refusal
of
her
choice
not
even
my
paternal
authority
will
be
able
to
screen
you
from
her
severity
and
your
life
will
be
made
miserable
without
your
father
being
able
to
relieve
you
on
the
other
hand
when
you
are
out
of
her
house
she
can
not
distress
you
nor
prevent
me
from
doing
you
the
justice
which
i
owe
my
child
nay
possibly
in
time
i
may
be
able
to
work
out
a
reconciliation
between
you
but
she
must
not
know
that
i
was
consenting
to
this
marriage
lest
an
irreconcileable
quarrel
should
ensue
i
fell
at
my
father
feet
and
embraced
his
knees
for
this
tender
and
unexpected
proof
of
his
affection
mr
vere
father
was
no
stranger
to
his
son
attachment
and
we
were
very
sure
he
would
readily
come
into
the
proposal
which
my
father
intended
to
make
the
two
parents
had
a
meeting
secretly
where
all
the
terms
of
portion
and
settlement
were
speedily
and
privately
adjusted
mr
vere
the
father
who
had
been
long
intimate
in
our
family
knew
very
well
the
necessity
there
was
for
keeping
the
secret
after
this
my
lover
and
i
were
to
be
married
privately
without
the
knowlege
seemingly
of
any
one
in
either
family
excepting
one
of
the
miss
veres
who
was
to
be
present
and
when
the
time
of
my
probation
was
expired
my
father
was
to
let
my
mother
into
the
knowlege
of
this
affair
as
a
thing
he
had
just
discovered
and
to
pacify
her
anger
as
well
he
could
every
thing
was
conducted
in
the
manner
proposed
i
was
married
with
the
utmost
privacy
and
continued
in
my
father
house
till
the
day
arrived
when
i
was
to
give
my
definitive
answer
unfortunately
for
me
my
mother
chose
to
receive
it
from
my
own
mouth
and
called
me
into
her
presence
i
appeared
before
her
trembling
and
terrified
i
had
not
seen
her
for
a
fortnight
and
i
was
in
dread
lest
the
discovery
i
had
to
make
should
banish
me
her
sight
perhaps
for
ever
unless
my
father
might
influence
her
in
time
to
forgive
me
she
asked
me
with
a
stern
brow
what
i
had
resolved
on
i
had
not
courage
to
make
her
an
answer
but
burst
into
tears
she
repeated
her
question
and
i
could
only
reply
madam
it
is
not
in
my
to
obey
you
she
did
not
comprehend
the
meaning
of
my
words
but
imputing
them
to
obstinacy
commanded
me
to
leave
the
room
and
not
to
see
her
face
till
i
came
to
a
proper
sense
of
my
duty
at
the
same
time
ordering
me
into
my
chamber
where
i
was
to
be
locked
up
i
flew
to
my
father
and
conjured
him
to
let
my
mother
know
the
truth
at
once
that
i
might
be
no
longer
subject
to
such
harsh
treatment
for
i
knew
the
being
sent
home
to
my
husband
would
be
the
consequence
of
her
being
told
that
i
had
one
my
poor
father
was
almost
afraid
to
undertake
the
task
though
he
had
been
the
chief
promoter
of
my
marriage
and
his
authority
ought
to
have
given
sanction
to
it
he
ventured
however
to
let
her
know
that
i
had
confessed
to
him
what
my
fears
of
her
immediate
resentment
would
not
suffer
me
to
discover
whilst
i
was
in
her
presence
and
what
my
aversion
to
the
man
she
proposed
to
me
and
the
rigours
i
had
been
threatened
with
if
i
refused
him
had
driven
me
to
the
rage
my
mother
flew
into
was
little
short
of
phrenzy
and
my
father
made
haste
to
send
me
out
of
the
house
mr
vere
whole
family
received
me
with
great
tenderness
but
i
was
sorry
at
leaving
my
father
whose
visits
to
me
were
made
but
seldom
and
even
those
by
stealth
my
situation
though
i
was
united
to
the
man
i
loved
and
caressed
by
all
his
family
was
far
from
being
happy
my
mother
inflexible
temper
was
not
to
be
wrought
upon
notwithstanding
my
father
did
his
utmost
to
prevail
on
her
to
see
and
to
forgive
me
and
she
carried
her
resentment
so
far
that
she
told
my
father
unless
he
cut
me
off
entirely
in
his
will
she
was
determined
to
separate
herself
totally
from
him
this
was
an
extremity
he
by
no
means
expected
she
would
have
gone
to
in
a
fit
of
sickness
which
had
seized
him
a
few
years
before
he
had
left
me
ten
thousand
pounds
five
of
this
he
had
secretly
transferred
to
mr
vere
on
the
day
of
my
marriage
and
had
promised
him
to
bequeath
me
five
more
at
his
death
in
consequence
of
this
disposition
he
purposed
making
a
new
will
so
that
he
the
less
scrupled
giving
my
mother
up
the
old
one
with
a
promise
of
making
another
agreeable
to
her
request
my
mother
jointure
was
already
settled
on
her
my
eldest
sister
had
received
her
portion
so
that
there
was
little
bequeathed
by
this
testament
but
my
fortune
and
a
few
other
small
legacies
my
mother
tore
the
will
with
indignation
and
not
satisfied
with
my
father
promise
insisted
on
his
putting
it
into
execution
immediately
in
short
his
easy
temper
yielded
to
her
importunities
and
he
had
a
will
drawn
up
by
her
instructions
in
which
i
was
cut
off
with
one
shilling
and
my
intended
fortune
bequeathed
to
my
eldest
sister
my
mother
was
made
residuary
legatee
to
every
thing
that
should
remain
after
paying
all
the
bequests
this
would
have
amounted
to
a
considerable
sum
if
the
half
of
my
portion
which
was
already
paid
without
her
knowlege
had
not
made
such
a
diminution
in
the
personal
estate
that
after
paying
my
sister
the
whole
of
what
was
specified
in
the
will
there
was
scarce
any
thing
likely
to
remain
had
my
mother
known
this
secret
she
would
not
perhaps
have
been
so
ready
to
have
made
my
father
devise
all
my
intended
fortune
to
my
sister
my
father
who
was
aware
of
this
durst
not
however
inform
her
at
that
juncture
how
much
she
hurt
herself
by
forcing
him
to
such
measures
she
insisted
upon
his
leaving
the
whole
of
what
he
designed
for
me
to
my
eldest
sister
as
well
as
to
convince
him
she
said
that
she
had
no
views
as
to
be
an
example
to
other
rebellious
children
my
father
had
no
remedy
on
these
occasions
but
a
patient
acquiescence
the
will
was
made
and
my
mother
herself
would
keep
it
my
father
took
an
opportunity
the
same
day
to
inform
me
what
he
had
done
but
assured
me
he
would
immediately
make
another
will
agreeable
to
his
first
intentions
and
leave
it
in
the
hands
of
a
faithful
friend
this
was
his
design
but
alas
he
lived
not
to
execute
it
he
was
seized
that
night
with
a
paralytic
disorder
which
at
once
deprived
him
of
the
use
of
his
limbs
and
his
speech
they
who
were
about
him
believed
he
retained
his
senses
but
he
was
not
capable
of
making
himself
understood
even
by
signs
alarmed
with
this
dismal
account
of
my
beloved
situation
i
flew
to
the
house
without
considering
my
displeasure
but
i
was
not
permitted
to
see
him
i
filled
the
house
with
my
cries
but
to
no
purpose
i
had
not
the
satisfaction
of
receiving
even
a
farewell
look
from
him
which
was
all
he
was
capable
of
bestowing
on
me
he
languished
for
several
days
in
this
melancholy
condition
and
then
in
spite
of
the
aid
of
physic
expired
the
loss
of
this
dear
father
so
entirely
took
up
my
thoughts
that
i
never
reflected
on
the
loss
of
the
remaining
part
of
my
fortune
but
it
was
not
so
with
my
there
had
been
a
settlement
made
on
me
in
consequence
of
the
fortune
promised
though
not
equal
to
what
it
demanded
yet
superior
to
the
half
which
was
paid
he
relied
on
my
father
word
for
the
remainder
and
had
no
doubt
of
its
being
secured
to
him
knowing
his
circumstances
as
well
as
his
strict
integrity
and
that
my
sister
had
actually
received
the
same
fortune
which
i
was
promised
mr
vere
had
four
daughters
and
it
was
on
this
fortune
he
chiefly
depended
to
provide
for
them
the
news
of
my
being
cut
off
with
a
shilling
exceedingly
surprized
and
exasperated
him
unluckily
i
had
not
mentioned
to
him
nor
even
to
my
husband
the
will
which
my
father
had
been
obliged
to
make
the
assurances
he
gave
me
of
immediately
making
another
in
my
favour
prevented
me
as
i
thought
it
would
only
be
a
very
severe
proof
of
my
mother
enmity
to
the
family
which
i
could
have
wished
to
conceal
from
them
especially
as
i
did
not
imagine
it
would
have
affected
me
afterwards
mr
vere
the
elder
was
from
home
when
my
father
died
and
his
business
detained
him
for
more
than
a
month
after
his
funeral
was
over
my
husband
on
this
occasion
shewed
the
tender
and
disinterested
love
he
bore
me
he
affected
to
make
as
light
as
possible
of
this
unexpected
disappointment
but
at
the
same
time
expressed
his
uneasiness
lest
his
father
should
carry
matters
to
an
extremity
with
my
mother
from
whom
we
knew
we
were
to
expect
nothing
by
mild
methods
it
was
now
thought
adviseable
that
i
should
write
to
my
mother
to
condole
with
her
on
my
father
death
again
to
intreat
her
forgiveness
of
my
fault
and
as
some
mitigation
of
it
to
acknowlege
that
it
was
not
only
with
my
father
privity
but
even
with
his
consent
and
approbation
that
i
had
married
i
wrote
this
letter
in
a
strain
of
the
utmost
humility
without
mentioning
a
word
of
my
fortune
i
thought
it
would
be
time
enough
for
me
to
do
if
i
could
prevail
on
my
mother
to
see
me
and
would
at
all
events
come
better
from
my
husband
or
his
father
than
from
me
but
i
gained
nothing
by
this
only
some
unkind
reflections
on
my
father
memory
and
a
message
that
since
he
thought
proper
to
marry
his
daughter
in
a
manner
so
highly
disagreeable
to
her
mother
he
should
have
taken
care
of
providing
for
her
as
he
could
not
expect
a
parent
so
disobliged
as
she
had
been
would
take
any
notice
of
me
my
mother
had
been
left
sole
executrix
to
my
father
forced
will
and
she
took
care
to
put
my
sister
and
the
other
legatees
into
possession
of
what
was
bequeathed
to
them
in
a
very
short
time
after
his
decease
she
found
there
was
an
unexpected
deficiency
in
his
personal
fortune
insomuch
that
there
was
barely
enough
to
pay
his
debts
and
that
her
being
left
the
residue
after
the
specified
legacies
were
paid
amounted
to
nothing
on
the
contrary
had
my
father
just
intentions
taken
place
in
leaving
me
five
thousand
pounds
she
would
have
come
in
for
the
other
five
but
the
whole
ten
thousand
now
went
to
my
sister
she
was
not
long
however
at
a
loss
to
know
how
this
came
to
pass
mr
vere
determined
to
assert
his
own
and
his
son
right
and
being
exceedingly
provoked
at
my
mother
behaviour
wrote
to
her
immediately
on
his
return
home
and
having
informed
her
of
the
settlement
made
on
me
on
account
of
the
fortune
already
paid
and
what
was
farther
agreed
on
to
be
paid
by
my
father
told
her
he
expected
that
this
promise
should
be
punctually
fulfilled
he
said
he
knew
she
had
it
in
her
power
to
do
this
and
since
it
was
by
her
contrivance
i
had
been
robbed
of
my
just
right
if
honour
and
the
duty
of
a
parent
would
not
induce
her
to
make
me
proper
amends
she
must
excuse
him
if
he
made
use
of
such
means
as
the
laws
allowed
him
in
order
to
compel
her
such
a
letter
to
a
woman
of
my
mother
temper
met
with
such
a
reception
as
might
be
expected
she
tore
it
before
his
messenger
face
and
desired
him
to
tell
his
master
that
as
what
he
had
already
obtained
was
by
fraud
so
he
was
at
liberty
to
make
use
of
force
to
recover
the
remainder
but
with
her
consent
he
never
should
have
a
single
shilling
this
exasperating
reply
made
my
directly
commence
a
suit
against
her
in
which
the
other
legatees
were
made
parties
the
distress
i
felt
on
this
occasion
is
scarce
to
be
imagined
the
breach
was
now
so
widened
between
my
mother
and
my
husband
family
that
there
remained
not
the
least
hope
of
its
ever
being
closed
mr
vere
unwillingly
joined
with
his
father
in
pursuit
of
these
measures
he
would
for
my
sake
much
rather
have
yielded
up
his
expectations
than
supported
them
at
the
expence
of
my
quiet
but
his
father
will
and
justice
to
the
rest
of
his
family
compelled
him
to
proceed
and
deprived
me
of
any
pretence
for
interposing
the
was
carrying
on
with
great
acrimony
on
both
sides
when
an
event
happened
that
made
me
then
and
has
indeed
ever
since
look
with
indifference
on
every
thing
in
this
life
it
was
the
death
of
my
husband
he
was
snatched
from
me
by
a
violent
fever
before
he
reached
his
twentieth
year
i
will
not
pretend
to
describe
my
sufferings
to
you
on
this
sad
occasion
they
were
aggravated
by
my
being
near
the
time
of
whatever
affliction
mr
vere
felt
for
the
death
of
his
only
son
it
did
not
make
him
forgetful
of
what
he
owed
his
daughters
and
he
was
resolved
to
carry
on
the
with
the
utmost
vigour
you
may
suppose
the
house
wherein
i
had
lost
a
beloved
husband
appeared
a
dismal
place
to
me
especially
in
my
present
situation
i
thought
too
my
father
looks
began
to
grow
colder
to
me
than
they
used
to
be
and
i
begged
i
might
have
his
permission
to
remove
for
a
while
he
did
not
oppose
it
and
i
went
at
the
pressing
intreaties
of
your
favourite
the
good
old
dean
to
his
house
where
he
and
his
lady
behaved
to
me
with
more
than
parental
tenderness
my
health
was
in
so
declining
a
way
that
this
worthy
man
as
i
have
since
learned
made
several
applications
to
my
mother
to
see
me
but
without
success
at
length
the
hour
of
my
delivery
arrived
and
i
was
brought
of
a
dead
female
child
the
estate
in
case
of
mr
vere
dying
without
issue
devolved
on
his
sisters
and
i
was
in
hopes
that
this
circumstance
so
favourable
to
the
young
ladies
would
have
induced
their
father
to
have
been
less
rigorous
in
persisting
in
his
claim
but
in
this
i
was
deceived
he
loved
money
and
was
besides
full
of
resentment
against
my
mother
i
thought
however
of
an
expedient
which
i
flattered
myself
might
work
upon
him
and
by
good
fortune
it
succeeded
mr
vere
though
i
had
left
his
house
visited
me
constantly
and
kept
up
a
shew
of
tenderness
which
i
am
sure
he
had
not
in
his
heart
i
told
him
one
day
whilst
i
was
still
confined
to
my
bed
that
as
i
had
now
lost
both
my
husband
and
my
child
a
very
moderate
income
would
be
sufficient
for
me
and
that
as
i
valued
my
mother
peace
of
mind
beyond
any
selfish
consideration
i
was
very
willing
to
give
up
half
my
jointure
provided
he
would
drop
his
suit
mr
vere
seemed
surprized
at
the
proposal
he
said
he
wondered
i
could
be
so
blind
to
my
own
interest
and
that
all
he
was
doing
was
purely
for
my
sake
i
thanked
him
for
his
pretended
friendship
but
assured
him
he
could
serve
me
no
way
so
effectually
as
by
coming
into
the
measure
i
proposed
mr
vere
said
i
talked
like
a
child
but
he
would
consider
of
it
the
following
day
he
called
on
me
again
and
told
me
that
to
make
me
easy
he
was
willing
to
come
into
my
proposal
that
he
would
have
the
proper
instruments
drawn
by
which
i
would
relinquish
half
my
jointure
and
he
in
consequence
to
give
up
all
claim
on
my
father
estate
i
was
much
better
pleased
at
this
losing
agreement
than
if
i
had
acquired
a
large
accession
of
fortune
mr
vere
soon
got
the
proper
deeds
ready
and
they
were
executed
in
form
i
now
relapsed
into
an
illness
from
which
i
was
supposed
to
have
been
quite
recovered
and
my
life
was
thought
in
great
danger
i
have
since
been
told
that
mr
vere
repented
his
agreement
at
that
juncture
and
told
some
of
his
friends
that
if
he
had
not
been
so
hasty
he
should
have
had
a
chance
for
my
jointure
and
my
fortune
too
i
begged
of
the
dean
to
go
to
my
mother
and
use
his
last
efforts
on
her
to
prevail
with
her
to
see
me
and
forgive
me
before
i
died
at
the
same
time
i
sent
her
the
release
i
had
procured
from
mr
vere
which
i
knew
was
the
most
acceptable
present
i
could
make
her
the
dean
urged
the
danger
i
was
in
without
its
seeming
to
make
much
impression
on
her
i
am
willing
to
believe
that
she
thought
the
dean
exaggerated
in
his
account
of
my
illness
he
owned
to
me
himself
that
he
was
shocked
to
find
her
so
obdurate
at
length
he
took
the
paper
out
of
his
pocket
and
presenting
it
to
her
i
am
sorry
madam
said
he
i
can
not
prevail
with
you
to
act
like
a
parent
or
a
christian
your
daughter
i
fear
will
not
survive
her
present
malady
but
she
will
have
the
comfort
to
consider
that
she
has
left
nothing
unattempted
to
obtain
that
forgiveness
which
you
so
cruelly
deny
her
i
hope
lady
grimston
your
last
hours
may
be
as
peaceful
as
hers
i
trust
will
be
from
this
reflection
there
madam
she
has
by
that
instrument
left
you
disengaged
from
a
troublesome
and
vexatious
that
would
if
pursued
infallibly
turn
out
to
your
disadvantage
it
was
all
she
do
and
what
few
children
used
like
her
have
done
my
mother
a
great
deal
alarmed
at
the
dean
manner
of
speaking
now
examined
the
contents
of
the
paper
she
seemed
affected
and
called
him
back
as
he
was
just
leaving
the
room
she
told
him
she
was
not
lost
to
the
feelings
of
nature
and
that
if
he
thought
her
presence
would
contribute
to
ease
my
mind
of
the
remorse
it
must
needs
labour
under
she
was
not
against
seeing
me
the
good
man
glad
to
find
her
in
this
yielding
disposition
told
her
she
could
not
too
soon
execute
her
intention
and
pressed
her
to
come
to
his
house
directly
she
suffered
him
to
put
her
into
his
coach
and
he
carried
her
home
with
him
the
interview
on
my
side
was
attended
with
tears
of
joy
tenderness
and
contrition
my
mother
did
not
depart
from
her
usual
austerity
she
gave
me
but
her
hand
to
kiss
and
pronounced
her
forgiveness
and
her
blessing
in
so
languid
a
manner
as
greatly
damped
the
fervor
of
my
joy
she
staid
with
me
not
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
having
talked
of
indifferent
things
without
once
so
much
as
mentioning
what
i
had
done
she
took
a
cold
and
formal
leave
this
interview
as
little
cordial
as
my
mother
behaviour
was
to
me
had
so
good
an
effect
on
me
that
i
began
perceptibly
to
mend
from
that
hour
she
sent
indeed
constantly
to
enquire
how
i
did
but
avoided
coming
lest
as
she
said
she
should
meet
with
mr
vere
whom
she
could
never
forgive
as
soon
as
i
was
in
a
condition
to
go
abroad
i
went
to
pay
my
duty
to
her
she
received
me
with
civility
but
no
tenderness
nor
has
she
ever
from
that
time
made
me
the
least
recompence
for
what
i
have
lost
her
permitting
me
to
see
her
she
thinks
sufficient
amends
i
did
not
chuse
to
return
to
mr
vere
house
as
i
had
only
a
polite
not
a
kind
invitation
one
of
his
daughters
she
who
had
been
present
at
my
marriage
and
who
always
had
shewn
most
affection
towards
me
was
about
this
time
married
to
a
gentleman
whose
estate
lay
in
another
country
when
the
bride
went
home
she
pressed
me
to
go
with
her
so
warmly
that
i
could
not
refuse
her
and
during
the
time
i
staid
with
her
i
received
so
many
marks
of
tenderness
from
her
that
i
resolved
to
settle
in
her
neighbourhood
and
have
now
a
little
house
near
her
where
i
have
resided
constantly
ever
since
i
come
once
or
twice
a
year
to
pay
a
visit
to
my
mother
but
my
reception
as
you
may
see
is
always
cold
and
i
seldom
stay
more
than
a
few
days
old
mr
vere
is
dead
and
his
daughters
who
were
coheiresses
to
his
estate
are
all
married
so
that
the
family
is
intirely
dispersed
but
notwithstanding
this
and
the
number
of
years
that
have
passed
over
since
my
marriage
my
mother
can
not
yet
endure
the
name
of
the
family
and
always
as
you
may
have
observed
calls
me
by
my
maiden
name
i
was
much
affected
at
the
story
of
the
amiable
mrs
vere
the
sweet
melancholy
which
predominates
in
her
countenance
shews
that
the
spirits
when
broken
in
the
bud
of
youth
are
hardly
to
be
recovered
what
a
tyrant
this
lady
grimston
is
i
did
not
admire
her
before
but
i
now
absolutely
dislike
her
what
a
wife
and
a
mother
has
she
been
to
a
husband
and
a
daughter
who
might
have
constituted
the
happiness
of
a
woman
of
a
different
temper
and
yet
she
passes
for
a
wonderful
good
woman
and
a
pattern
of
all
those
virtues
of
a
religion
which
meekness
and
forgiveness
characterise
she
is
mistaken
if
she
thinks
that
austerity
is
necessary
to
christianity
the
most
that
my
charity
allows
me
to
believe
of
such
people
is
that
they
impose
on
at
a
time
when
the
most
discerning
perhaps
think
that
they
are
endeavouring
to
impose
on
others
what
an
angel
is
my
good
mother
when
compared
to
this
her
friend
whom
her
humility
makes
her
look
upon
as
her
superior
in
virtue
i
am
very
angry
with
sir
george
who
in
his
resentment
said
to
me
once
that
she
was
like
lady
grimston
i
then
knew
but
little
of
that
lady
character
or
i
should
have
reproved
him
for
it
i
conjured
mrs
vere
to
make
her
visit
longer
than
she
had
at
first
intended
she
told
me
she
would
most
gladly
do
it
but
that
it
was
a
liberty
she
did
not
dare
to
take
unless
her
mother
asked
her
to
prolong
it
which
she
said
she
possibly
might
do
in
complaisance
to
me
my
mother
i
find
has
made
lady
grimston
her
confidant
in
relation
to
my
affairs
the
dear
woman
never
keeps
her
mind
to
herself
on
any
subject
lady
grimston
highly
applauds
her
conduct
in
that
business
and
bestowed
a
few
civil
words
on
me
for
my
filial
duty
intermixed
with
an
ungrateful
comparison
of
her
own
daughter
behaviour
and
she
condoled
with
herself
by
saying
that
had
not
always
she
told
my
mother
that
she
wished
to
see
the
child
meaning
me
happily
disposed
of
for
that
notwithstanding
the
prudence
of
my
behaviour
the
world
would
be
apt
to
cast
reflections
on
me
on
account
of
the
abruptness
with
which
the
match
was
broken
off
without
the
true
reasons
being
known
and
my
illness
she
said
might
be
imputed
to
the
disappointment
which
might
incline
people
to
suspect
the
rejection
had
been
on
mr
faulkland
side
what
a
provoking
hint
was
this
my
dear
it
has
really
alarmed
my
mother
who
depends
much
on
the
judgment
of
her
friend
and
has
at
the
same
time
so
nice
a
regard
to
the
honour
of
her
family
i
wish
that
formal
old
woman
would
mind
her
own
business
my
mother
and
lady
grimston
have
had
abundance
of
private
confabulation
these
two
days
from
which
mrs
vere
and
i
are
excluded
i
wish
there
may
not
be
some
mischief
a
brewing
one
thing
however
has
given
me
pleasure
lady
grimston
has
invited
her
daughter
to
stay
at
as
long
as
my
mother
and
i
continue
here
mrs
vere
tells
me
she
suspects
the
subject
of
their
conferences
but
she
is
perverse
and
will
not
tell
me
what
she
thinks
for
fear
as
she
says
she
should
have
guessed
wrong
and
her
surmises
would
only
teaze
me
a
packet
sent
me
from
london
a
letter
from
sir
george
one
from
my
cecilia
and
so
soon
too
welcome
welcome
thou
faithful
messenger
from
the
faithfullest
of
hearts
thou
dear
anticipating
little
prophetess
what
put
it
into
thy
head
to
call
mr
arnold
a
new
conquest
upon
my
but
barely
mentioning
him
to
you
i
was
just
going
to
tell
you
all
and
behold
your
own
whimsical
imagination
has
suggested
the
most
material
part
to
you
already
you
desire
me
to
be
sincere
was
that
necessary
my
sister
from
to
you
say
you
are
mr
arnold
is
or
will
be
my
and
insist
on
my
being
more
particular
in
my
description
of
him
what
a
strange
girl
you
are
again
i
ask
you
what
put
this
into
your
head
what
busy
little
spirit
of
intelligence
flew
to
you
with
the
news
before
i
knew
it
myself
for
as
to
the
fact
it
is
but
too
certain
this
has
been
the
subject
of
my
mother
and
lady
grimston
private
conferences
and
mrs
vere
sly
thing
as
she
is
guessed
it
it
seems
mr
arnold
disclosed
his
passion
to
lady
grimston
in
order
to
ask
her
advice
about
it
she
loves
mightily
to
be
consulted
and
as
i
am
did
me
the
honour
to
recommend
me
strongly
to
him
and
she
has
prepossessed
my
mother
too
in
favour
of
this
new
man
i
wish
the
meddling
old
dame
had
been
dumb
now
shall
i
go
through
another
fiery
tryal
heaven
help
me
if
lady
grimston
were
to
be
my
judge
but
my
mother
is
all
goodness
well
but
you
want
a
description
of
this
man
i
will
give
it
to
you
though
i
have
scarce
patience
to
write
about
him
indeed
cecilia
i
am
vexed
i
foresee
a
great
deal
of
trouble
from
that
but
come
i
will
try
what
i
can
say
the
man
is
about
thirty
genteel
and
handsome
enough
at
least
he
is
reckoned
so
and
i
believe
i
should
think
him
so
if
i
were
not
angry
with
him
he
is
very
like
your
brother
henry
and
you
know
he
is
an
allowed
handsome
man
he
seems
to
have
plain
good
sense
and
is
good
humoured
i
believe
i
do
not
know
of
what
colour
his
eyes
are
for
i
never
looked
much
at
him
lady
grimston
says
he
is
a
a
thing
she
pretends
to
value
highly
and
a
mighty
sober
pious
worthy
gentleman
he
is
of
a
very
good
family
and
has
an
estate
of
about
fifteen
hundred
pounds
a
year
upon
which
there
is
a
jointure
of
three
hundred
pounds
a
year
paid
to
his
brother
widow
part
of
the
estate
is
in
kent
and
part
in
this
county
of
essex
where
he
has
a
a
looking
place
something
in
the
stile
at
about
a
mile
distance
from
this
where
he
passes
most
of
his
time
i
have
told
you
already
he
plays
divinely
on
several
instruments
this
is
the
only
circumstance
about
him
that
pleases
me
he
has
not
yet
made
his
addresses
to
me
in
form
yet
we
all
know
that
he
intends
it
from
his
uncommon
assiduity
towards
me
but
he
has
a
sort
of
reserve
about
him
and
loves
to
do
every
thing
in
his
own
way
bless
me
here
he
is
his
chariot
has
just
driven
into
the
court
and
mrs
vere
peeps
in
upon
me
and
with
a
most
vexatious
archness
bids
me
come
down
to
the
parlour
but
i
will
not
unless
my
mother
desires
me
i
will
go
into
the
garden
to
be
for
a
while
out
of
the
way
yesterday
evening
was
productive
of
nothing
but
looks
and
compliments
and
bows
and
so
forth
except
two
or
three
delightful
pieces
of
musick
which
he
executed
incomparably
but
this
morning
my
cecilia
oh
this
morning
the
man
spoke
out
told
me
in
plain
english
that
he
loved
me
how
insipid
is
such
a
declaration
when
it
comes
from
one
who
is
indifferent
to
us
i
do
not
know
how
it
was
but
instead
of
being
abashed
i
could
have
smiled
in
his
face
when
he
declared
himself
but
you
may
be
sure
i
did
not
that
would
not
have
been
pretty
i
was
sitting
in
the
little
reading
when
he
came
in
to
be
sure
he
was
sent
to
me
by
the
ancient
ladies
otherwise
he
would
not
have
intruded
for
the
man
is
not
the
book
happened
to
be
horace
upon
his
entering
the
room
i
laid
it
by
he
asked
me
politely
enough
what
were
my
studies
when
i
named
the
author
he
took
the
book
up
and
opening
the
leaves
started
and
looked
me
full
in
the
face
i
coloured
my
charming
miss
bidulph
said
he
do
you
prefer
this
to
the
agreeable
entertainment
of
finishing
this
beautiful
rose
here
that
seems
to
blush
at
your
neglect
of
it
he
spoke
this
pointing
to
a
little
piece
of
embroidery
that
lay
in
a
frame
before
me
i
was
nettled
at
the
question
it
was
too
assuming
sir
i
hope
i
was
as
innocently
and
as
usefully
employed
and
i
assure
you
i
give
a
greater
portion
of
my
time
to
my
needle
than
to
my
book
you
are
so
lovely
madam
that
nothing
you
can
do
needs
an
apology
an
apology
i
assure
you
did
not
this
look
my
dear
as
if
the
man
thought
i
ought
to
beg
his
pardon
for
understanding
latin
for
this
accidental
and
i
think
to
a
woman
trivial
accomplishment
i
am
indebted
you
know
to
sir
george
who
took
so
much
pains
with
me
the
two
or
three
summers
he
was
indisposed
at
sidney
castle
he
then
proceeded
to
tell
me
how
much
he
admired
how
much
he
loved
me
and
that
having
been
encouraged
by
lady
grimston
assuring
him
that
i
was
disengaged
observe
that
he
presumed
to
tell
me
so
oh
thought
i
perhaps
thou
are
thyself
a
grimstonian
and
do
not
think
it
necessary
that
the
heart
should
be
consulted
i
answered
him
mighty
civilly
and
mighty
little
to
the
purpose
sir
i
thank
you
for
your
favourable
sentiments
lady
grimston
does
me
a
great
deal
of
honour
i
think
myself
happy
in
her
good
opinion
but
he
was
not
to
be
so
put
off
he
pressed
me
to
give
him
hopes
as
he
called
it
alas
i
have
no
hopes
to
give
him
he
said
he
would
not
presume
to
mention
his
love
to
my
mother
though
lady
grimston
pressed
him
to
it
it
was
like
her
till
he
had
first
declared
himself
to
me
this
was
not
indelicate
my
heart
thanked
him
for
it
though
i
only
returned
him
a
bow
we
were
seasonably
to
me
at
least
interrupted
here
by
the
arrival
of
my
friend
the
dean
he
had
come
to
see
lady
grimston
just
as
mr
arnold
had
entered
into
conversation
with
me
the
old
gentleman
had
a
mind
to
walk
in
the
garden
the
little
where
we
were
opened
into
it
by
a
glass
door
so
that
lady
grimston
and
my
mother
were
obliged
to
bring
him
that
way
though
i
was
glad
that
the
conversation
was
broke
off
yet
i
could
have
wished
that
i
had
first
had
an
opportunity
of
throwing
a
little
cold
water
on
mr
arnold
lest
he
should
have
put
too
favourable
an
interpretation
on
the
reception
i
gave
him
and
mention
the
thing
to
my
mother
before
i
had
time
to
speak
to
her
i
was
in
some
confusion
at
their
entering
the
room
mr
arnold
had
at
that
time
laid
hold
of
one
of
my
hands
and
i
had
but
just
time
to
withdraw
it
when
the
door
flew
open
to
give
entrance
to
the
two
ladies
and
the
good
man
the
latter
lifting
up
both
his
hands
as
if
conscious
of
having
done
something
wrong
with
a
freedom
asked
pardon
but
with
a
look
that
seemed
to
indicate
he
thought
the
apology
necessary
both
to
mr
arnold
and
me
this
disconcerted
me
more
my
mother
smiled
and
lady
grimston
drew
up
her
long
neck
and
winked
at
the
dean
i
took
up
my
hat
that
lay
in
a
window
without
what
i
did
and
said
i
would
wait
on
them
into
the
garden
mr
arnold
followed
my
example
but
looked
at
me
i
do
not
know
how
impertinently
as
if
he
thought
i
did
not
dislike
him
i
took
one
turn
with
them
and
then
slipped
away
under
pretence
of
going
in
to
dress
i
ran
directly
into
mrs
vere
room
and
told
her
what
had
passed
between
mr
arnold
and
me
she
laughed
and
said
she
could
have
told
me
long
ago
it
would
have
come
to
that
i
knew
mr
arnold
admired
you
said
she
the
first
time
i
saw
you
in
his
company
he
is
no
contemptible
conquest
i
can
tell
you
he
assured
my
mother
that
you
were
the
only
woman
he
ever
saw
in
his
life
that
had
made
an
impression
on
him
and
i
am
inclined
to
believe
him
for
he
is
not
a
man
of
an
amorous
complexion
nor
did
i
ever
hear
of
his
making
his
addresses
to
any
one
though
he
might
have
his
choice
of
the
best
fortunes
and
the
best
families
in
the
country
for
the
ladies
i
must
inform
you
admire
him
exceedingly
and
when
you
are
known
to
be
his
choice
you
will
be
the
envy
of
all
the
young
women
in
the
country
i
sighed
i
do
know
why
and
said
i
desired
not
to
create
envy
on
that
account
mrs
vere
said
why
really
miss
bidulph
if
your
heart
is
at
liberty
i
know
of
no
man
more
worthy
of
it
than
mr
arnold
but
perhaps
looking
with
a
kind
earnestness
on
me
that
may
not
be
your
case
i
told
her
my
heart
was
not
engaged
as
it
really
is
not
for
indeed
cecilia
i
do
not
think
of
mr
faulkland
but
that
i
did
not
find
in
myself
any
great
inclination
towards
mr
arnold
oh
my
dear
said
she
if
you
find
no
disinclination
it
is
enough
i
married
for
love
yet
i
was
far
from
being
happy
the
vexation
that
i
occasioned
in
my
own
and
my
husband
family
was
a
to
the
satisfaction
of
possessing
the
man
i
loved
mr
arnold
besides
being
very
amiable
in
his
person
has
good
sense
and
good
temper
and
if
you
marry
him
with
nothing
more
than
indifference
gratitude
will
soon
produce
love
in
such
a
breast
as
yours
were
there
anything
like
aversion
in
your
heart
then
indeed
it
would
be
criminal
in
you
to
accept
of
him
mrs
vere
delivered
her
sentiments
with
such
a
calm
sweetness
such
a
disinterested
sincerity
that
what
she
said
made
an
impression
on
me
we
are
apt
contrary
as
it
may
seem
to
reason
to
be
more
wrought
upon
by
the
opinion
and
advice
of
young
people
like
ourselves
than
by
that
of
persons
whose
experience
certainly
gives
them
a
better
right
to
form
judgments
but
we
have
a
sort
of
a
natural
repugnance
to
the
being
dictated
to
even
by
those
who
have
an
authority
to
do
it
and
as
age
gives
a
superiority
every
thing
that
comes
from
it
carries
a
sort
of
air
of
prescribing
which
we
are
wonderfully
inclined
to
reject
had
lady
grimston
said
this
to
me
it
would
have
put
me
upon
my
guard
as
suspecting
a
design
on
my
liberty
of
choice
even
my
good
mother
might
have
been
listened
to
on
this
subject
not
without
uneasiness
though
my
duty
to
her
would
not
suffer
me
to
give
her
a
moment
pain
unless
i
was
sure
that
my
eternal
as
well
as
temporal
happiness
was
at
stake
i
told
mrs
vere
that
i
had
no
aversion
to
mr
arnold
on
the
contrary
that
if
i
had
a
sister
i
should
wish
her
married
to
him
now
my
cecilia
the
mischief
of
it
is
there
be
no
reasonable
objection
made
to
him
he
is
a
very
tolerable
man
but
i
knew
a
man
once
that
i
liked
better
but
fye
fye
upon
him
i
am
sure
i
ought
not
to
like
him
and
therefore
i
will
not
i
am
positive
if
i
were
let
alone
i
should
be
as
happy
as
ever
i
told
you
i
got
a
letter
from
my
brother
he
says
in
it
he
has
had
one
from
mr
faulkland
who
is
now
in
your
part
of
the
world
he
tells
sir
george
that
my
lady
bidulph
will
be
so
good
as
to
see
miss
and
converse
with
her
he
is
not
without
hopes
that
she
may
so
far
exculpate
him
as
to
induce
my
lady
to
repeal
his
sentence
of
banishment
sir
george
adds
his
own
wishes
for
this
but
says
to
give
you
words
he
fears
the
wench
will
not
be
honest
enough
to
do
faulkland
justice
justice
what
can
my
brother
mean
by
this
how
ungenerous
these
men
are
even
the
best
of
them
in
love
matters
he
knows
the
poor
girl
doats
on
her
destroyer
and
might
perhaps
take
shame
to
rather
than
throw
as
much
blame
on
him
as
he
deserves
i
think
this
is
all
the
justice
that
can
be
expected
from
her
and
how
poor
an
extenuation
would
this
make
of
his
guilt
it
would
only
add
to
the
merit
of
sufferings
without
lessening
his
fault
to
what
purpose
then
would
it
be
i
know
my
mother
sentiments
already
on
that
head
i
would
not
shew
sir
george
letter
to
her
he
had
said
so
many
ridiculous
things
about
lady
grimston
in
it
which
i
know
would
have
offended
her
highly
otherwise
on
account
of
mr
paragraph
i
should
have
been
glad
she
had
seen
it
ah
my
sister
my
friend
what
shall
i
do
oh
that
officious
lady
grimston
what
ill
star
drove
me
to
her
house
nothing
would
serve
her
but
she
must
know
what
mr
arnold
said
to
me
in
the
conference
and
how
i
had
behaved
she
made
her
enquiry
before
my
mother
and
the
dean
after
i
had
left
them
in
the
garden
what
could
the
man
do
he
had
no
reason
to
conceal
what
passed
and
frankly
owned
he
had
made
me
an
offer
of
his
heart
well
and
how
did
miss
receive
it
asked
lady
grimston
with
that
modesty
and
polite
sweetness
that
she
does
every
thing
answered
mr
arnold
he
could
say
no
less
you
know
he
thence
took
occasion
to
apply
particularly
to
my
mother
apologizing
at
the
same
time
for
his
not
having
done
it
before
what
the
creature
added
i
know
not
for
my
mother
from
whom
i
had
this
account
did
not
repeat
all
he
said
but
it
seems
it
was
enough
to
make
her
imagine
i
had
not
heard
him
reluctantly
and
accordingly
she
gave
him
her
permission
to
win
me
and
wear
me
i
could
cry
for
very
vexation
to
be
made
such
a
puppet
of
this
eclaircissement
i
dreaded
before
i
had
time
to
explain
myself
to
my
mother
that
best
of
women
still
anticipating
what
i
had
to
say
congratulated
me
on
my
extraordinary
prudence
in
not
letting
a
childish
misplaced
attachment
keep
such
a
hold
on
my
heart
as
to
make
me
blind
to
the
merits
of
a
more
deserving
object
dear
madam
said
i
sure
mr
arnold
did
not
say
that
i
had
encouraged
his
addresses
encouraged
my
dear
why
sure
the
hearing
from
a
young
lady
of
your
education
is
encouragement
enough
to
a
man
of
i
heard
him
with
complaisance
madam
because
i
thought
due
to
him
that
it
was
my
wish
to
remain
single
at
least
for
some
time
my
mother
looked
surprized
this
is
not
what
i
expected
from
you
i
flattered
myself
you
thought
no
longer
of
mr
faulkland
she
contracted
her
brow
a
little
madam
i
do
not
indeed
i
think
no
more
of
him
but
may
i
not
be
permitted
to
continue
as
i
am
had
you
never
had
any
engagement
with
mr
faulkland
answered
my
mother
i
should
be
far
from
urging
you
on
this
occasion
but
circumstanced
as
you
now
are
i
think
your
honour
is
concerned
lady
grimston
has
put
your
affair
in
such
a
light
to
me
as
i
never
considered
it
in
before
how
mortifying
must
the
reflection
be
my
dear
to
think
that
it
may
be
said
mr
faulkland
perhaps
flew
off
from
some
disadvantageous
circumstance
he
discovered
in
regard
to
you
the
world
wants
not
envious
malicious
tongues
enough
to
give
it
this
turn
your
unlucky
illness
and
your
brother
assiduity
in
going
so
often
to
him
when
he
was
at
richmond
looks
as
if
we
had
been
endeavouring
to
recall
him
every
body
knows
the
marriage
was
almost
concluded
and
lady
grimston
though
she
thinks
our
reasons
for
breaking
it
off
were
extremely
cogent
yet
as
she
knows
the
world
well
thinks
it
has
not
virtue
enough
to
believe
those
to
be
the
true
reasons
and
that
it
will
be
much
more
apt
to
put
an
invidious
construction
on
the
affair
that
may
be
very
detrimental
to
you
in
your
future
prospects
these
considerations
alone
ought
to
determine
you
but
there
is
one
still
of
greater
moment
which
i
hope
from
the
goodness
of
your
heart
will
have
still
greater
weight
with
you
that
unfortunate
young
lady
who
to
be
the
wife
of
mr
faulkland
if
you
were
once
put
beyond
the
reach
even
of
his
most
distant
hope
would
stand
the
better
chance
for
having
justice
done
to
her
at
least
it
would
leave
him
void
of
that
pretence
which
he
at
first
pleaded
and
which
probably
he
will
continue
to
do
while
you
remain
single
think
seriously
of
the
matter
my
love
i
shall
only
add
that
mr
arnold
is
every
way
an
unexceptionable
match
and
that
your
acceptance
of
him
will
be
extremely
agreeable
to
me
as
on
the
contrary
your
refusal
will
give
an
uneasiness
to
your
indulgent
mother
which
she
never
yet
experienced
from
you
she
left
me
with
these
cruel
words
cruel
in
their
kindness
oh
she
knows
i
am
flexible
by
nature
and
to
will
yielding
as
air
what
can
i
do
my
heart
is
not
in
a
disposition
to
love
yet
again
and
again
i
repeat
it
mr
faulkland
has
no
interest
there
what
he
once
had
he
has
lost
but
i
can
not
compel
it
to
like
and
unlike
and
like
anew
at
pleasure
fain
would
i
bring
myself
chearfully
to
conform
to
my
will
for
i
have
no
will
of
my
own
i
never
knew
what
it
was
to
have
one
and
never
shall
i
believe
for
i
am
sure
i
will
not
contend
with
a
husband
i
have
told
mrs
vere
what
my
mother
said
to
me
she
is
intirely
of
her
mind
every
body
is
combined
against
me
i
am
treated
like
a
baby
that
knows
not
what
is
fit
for
it
to
chuse
or
to
reject
i
have
been
searching
my
heart
my
dear
cecilia
to
try
if
there
remained
a
lurking
particle
of
my
former
flame
unextinguished
a
flame
i
call
it
as
we
are
allowed
the
metaphor
but
it
never
rose
to
it
was
but
a
single
ray
a
gentle
glow
that
just
warmed
my
breast
without
scorching
what
it
might
have
arisen
to
i
will
not
say
but
i
have
the
satisfaction
to
find
that
the
fire
is
quite
extinct
and
the
mansion
is
even
chilled
with
cold
this
was
a
very
necessary
scrutiny
before
i
would
even
entertain
a
thought
of
mr
arnold
and
believe
me
had
i
found
it
otherwise
than
i
say
i
would
rather
have
hazarded
my
mother
displeasure
by
owning
the
truth
to
her
than
injure
any
man
by
giving
him
my
hand
with
an
estranged
heart
i
will
acknowlege
to
you
my
sister
that
it
was
not
without
a
struggle
i
reduced
my
mind
to
this
frame
my
heart
foolish
thing
industrious
to
perplex
itself
would
fain
have
suggested
some
palliating
circumstances
in
mr
faulkland
favour
but
i
forbid
it
to
interpose
trifler
said
i
let
your
guardian
your
proper
guide
judge
and
determine
for
you
in
this
important
cause
whereupon
so
much
of
your
future
peace
depends
it
sighed
but
had
the
virtue
to
submit
and
i
arraigned
faulkland
before
a
little
tribunal
in
my
breast
where
i
would
suffer
reason
only
to
preside
the
little
felon
love
knocked
at
the
door
once
or
twice
but
justice
kept
him
out
and
after
a
long
and
i
think
a
fair
trial
he
was
at
length
cast
and
in
order
to
strengthen
my
resolves
and
justify
my
mother
as
well
as
my
own
conduct
these
are
the
arguments
which
i
have
deduced
from
the
evidences
against
him
if
mr
faulkland
feared
the
frailty
of
his
virtue
why
did
he
not
fly
when
he
was
first
alarmed
with
the
knowlege
of
the
lady
passion
for
him
if
not
for
his
own
sake
yet
at
least
for
her
if
he
could
not
return
her
love
was
he
not
cruel
in
suffering
her
to
feed
a
hopeless
flame
but
since
his
evil
fate
urged
him
on
and
the
unhappy
girl
lost
her
honour
was
he
not
bound
to
repair
it
he
had
never
seen
me
at
that
time
was
under
no
personal
engagements
to
me
and
might
easily
have
acquitted
himself
to
my
brother
from
so
justifiable
a
motive
what
if
i
had
married
him
ignorant
of
this
secret
and
it
had
afterwards
come
to
my
ears
how
miserable
would
it
have
made
me
to
think
that
i
had
stood
between
an
unfortunate
young
creature
and
her
happiness
for
had
mr
faulkland
never
heard
of
me
had
he
not
been
prejudiced
in
my
favour
this
young
woman
beauty
and
innocence
which
he
acknowleges
might
have
then
engaged
his
honest
vows
the
wicked
aunt
would
not
have
been
tempted
to
betray
her
trust
nor
he
shocking
thought
whenever
it
recurs
to
buy
that
favour
he
might
have
obtained
on
virtuous
terms
his
prior
engagements
to
my
brother
was
the
final
plea
that
undid
them
both
had
he
not
been
furnished
with
this
excuse
her
hopes
might
have
supported
her
virtue
or
if
ignorant
of
this
she
fell
what
pretence
could
he
offer
after
the
injury
done
for
not
fulfilling
an
obligation
of
so
much
importance
i
could
not
have
suffered
by
not
obtaining
a
man
i
never
saw
miss
is
undone
by
losing
him
yet
his
word
to
sir
george
the
breach
of
which
could
have
been
attended
with
no
ill
consequence
was
to
be
preferred
to
an
act
of
justice
this
is
that
false
honour
upon
which
the
men
pique
themselves
so
much
an
innocent
child
stigmatized
an
amiable
woman
abandoned
to
shame
and
grief
i
thank
heaven
i
made
not
myself
accessary
to
this
i
married
mr
faulkland
his
fault
i
could
not
say
so
nor
have
blamed
any
thing
but
my
own
imprudence
if
in
my
turn
found
myself
deserted
who
knows
but
he
might
after
having
bound
me
in
chains
return
to
his
neglected
mistress
and
love
which
when
it
would
have
been
meritorious
in
him
he
disrelished
he
might
have
pursued
with
eagerness
when
interdicted
this
might
have
been
the
case
i
believe
you
may
remember
an
instance
of
it
among
our
own
acquaintance
mr
saunders
who
refused
a
young
lady
for
his
bride
from
an
absolute
dislike
of
her
person
took
uncommon
pains
to
debauch
her
when
she
became
the
wife
of
his
friend
had
mr
faulkland
so
behaved
what
a
wretch
it
would
have
made
me
you
know
i
have
not
a
grain
of
jealousy
in
my
composition
yet
i
am
sure
a
neglect
of
this
kind
would
make
me
very
miserable
you
have
not
forgot
i
believe
that
about
two
years
ago
there
was
a
match
proposed
to
my
mother
by
the
bishop
of
between
me
and
his
nephew
the
young
man
was
heir
to
a
good
fortune
was
reckoned
handsome
and
accomplished
and
i
think
he
really
was
so
i
was
intirely
free
from
prepossessions
in
favour
of
any
one
and
had
no
objection
to
him
but
that
i
knew
he
had
a
most
heart
for
he
had
been
in
love
with
two
or
three
women
of
my
acquaintance
my
mother
mentioned
him
to
me
upon
the
good
old
prelate
recommendation
and
i
gave
her
this
as
my
reason
for
disliking
the
offer
which
she
approved
of
so
intirely
that
the
thing
went
no
farther
indeed
i
think
that
woman
is
a
fool
who
risques
her
contentment
with
one
of
a
light
disposition
marriage
will
not
change
men
natures
and
it
is
not
every
one
who
has
virtue
or
prudence
enough
to
be
reclaimed
upon
the
whole
i
am
satisfied
with
my
lot
and
am
sure
i
could
hear
with
pleasure
that
mr
faulkland
was
married
to
that
miss
i
wish
i
knew
the
other
letters
that
compose
her
name
my
mother
asked
me
had
i
considered
of
what
she
had
been
saying
to
me
i
told
her
i
had
and
only
begged
a
little
more
time
she
kissed
me
with
tears
in
her
eyes
to
be
sure
my
dear
as
much
as
you
can
reasonably
desire
i
know
my
sidney
is
above
trifling
mrs
vere
was
present
when
my
mother
left
the
room
oh
miss
bidulph
said
she
who
would
refuse
to
gratify
such
a
parent
as
that
had
mother
condescended
to
treat
me
so
i
am
sure
she
could
have
wrought
on
me
to
do
any
thing
she
liked
even
though
it
had
been
repugnant
to
my
inclination
dear
madam
i
replied
how
sweetly
you
inforce
my
duty
yes
i
will
obey
that
kindest
best
of
mothers
i
believe
i
spoke
this
tho
without
intending
it
in
a
tone
that
implied
something
like
making
a
merit
of
this
concession
for
mrs
vere
immediately
answered
there
a
good
child
that
to
oblige
its
mamma
will
accept
of
a
very
handsome
young
gentleman
with
a
good
estate
and
one
that
many
a
girl
in
england
would
give
her
eyes
for
i
felt
the
rebuke
but
turning
it
off
with
a
smile
said
but
you
forget
my
dear
that
i
am
not
dying
for
him
how
will
you
plume
yourself
on
your
sagacity
cecilia
when
you
read
this
account
of
my
love
which
you
so
wisely
foretold
i
can
tell
you
i
am
trying
to
like
mr
arnold
as
fast
as
i
can
i
make
him
sing
and
play
for
this
purpose
from
morning
till
night
for
he
is
here
every
day
and
all
day
lady
grimston
holds
her
head
a
quarter
of
a
yard
higher
than
she
did
before
and
looks
as
who
should
say
it
was
that
brought
this
about
the
dean
is
as
frolick
as
upon
it
for
he
is
very
fond
of
mr
arnold
but
tells
him
he
will
not
forgive
him
for
robbing
him
of
his
second
wife
for
such
he
says
he
intended
me
i
think
his
daughter
a
pretty
girl
of
about
seventeen
looks
a
little
grave
of
late
i
hope
she
does
not
like
mr
arnold
herself
i
wish
my
mother
would
take
it
into
her
head
that
she
was
in
love
with
him
and
that
mr
arnold
had
promised
to
marry
her
then
should
i
a
second
time
crown
me
with
a
willow
garland
but
there
is
no
fear
of
this
or
rather
no
hope
lady
grimston
has
given
my
mother
a
character
of
mr
arnold
that
if
you
will
take
her
word
for
it
there
is
not
a
man
like
him
in
the
world
and
my
mother
firmly
believes
every
syllable
she
says
she
told
me
to
day
she
would
write
to
sir
george
to
give
him
an
account
of
the
matter
and
desire
his
advice
this
is
a
compliment
she
would
not
omit
paying
for
any
consideration
tho
i
know
my
brother
judgment
has
now
lost
all
credit
with
her
and
that
let
his
opinion
be
what
it
will
she
is
firmly
resolved
on
her
new
plan
knowing
as
you
do
my
firmness
when
once
she
is
possessed
with
a
thing
you
will
not
wonder
that
i
did
not
make
attempts
to
alter
her
mind
which
i
knew
would
be
fruitless
she
likes
mr
arnold
prodigiously
she
piques
herself
on
her
skill
in
physiognomy
and
says
if
she
is
deceived
in
this
gentleman
she
will
never
again
rely
on
that
science
lady
grimston
is
so
fond
of
him
that
i
wonder
she
did
not
marry
him
herself
we
have
received
two
letters
from
sir
george
one
in
answer
to
my
mother
letter
the
other
to
me
i
will
give
them
both
to
you
the
following
is
a
copy
of
that
to
my
mother
madam
i
thank
you
for
the
honour
you
do
me
in
asking
my
advice
in
regard
to
the
proposal
of
marriage
you
have
received
for
my
sister
but
i
am
entirely
disqualified
from
giving
you
any
as
i
am
an
absolute
stranger
both
to
the
person
and
character
of
the
gentleman
you
mention
and
know
no
more
of
him
than
that
i
have
heard
there
such
a
person
who
has
some
estate
in
the
county
where
you
now
you
are
as
you
are
absolute
mistress
of
your
daughter
will
as
well
as
of
her
person
i
shall
not
presume
to
interfere
in
this
nice
point
if
the
marriage
is
not
agreed
upon
which
may
be
the
case
notwithstanding
the
compliment
you
do
me
the
favour
to
pay
me
i
think
it
would
be
generous
in
you
to
see
miss
and
hear
what
she
has
to
say
before
you
proceed
farther
but
in
this
as
in
every
thing
else
your
own
discretion
must
guide
you
i
am
madam
your
affectionate
son
and
most
obedient
servant
george
bidulph
my
mother
was
exceedingly
displeased
with
this
letter
she
said
sir
george
had
a
haughtiness
in
him
that
was
very
offensive
to
her
i
have
acquitted
myself
in
applying
to
him
and
shall
give
myself
no
farther
trouble
about
him
or
his
opinion
as
for
miss
i
think
she
can
hardly
be
under
a
necessity
of
coming
to
town
as
yet
and
that
affair
may
keep
cold
for
i
have
but
little
curiosity
to
hear
what
the
poor
soul
may
be
prompted
to
say
as
i
am
sure
i
shall
be
time
enough
to
afford
her
any
assistance
she
may
stand
in
need
of
this
was
the
whole
of
her
observation
my
brother
letter
to
me
is
as
follows
dear
sidney
i
received
with
concern
though
i
own
not
with
surprize
an
account
from
my
mother
of
a
new
treaty
of
marriage
that
is
on
foot
between
you
and
a
mr
arnold
of
whom
i
know
nothing
instead
of
congratulating
you
upon
this
occasion
i
can
not
help
condoling
with
you
for
i
have
a
better
opinion
of
your
heart
than
to
suppose
it
can
have
so
soon
renounced
poor
faulkland
i
do
not
reproach
you
for
your
acquiescence
in
giving
him
up
i
you
could
not
do
otherwise
but
why
in
the
name
of
precipitancy
are
you
to
be
hurried
into
wedlock
already
you
went
into
the
country
to
recover
your
health
i
thought
prithee
how
comes
this
new
husband
into
your
way
i
know
child
it
is
not
of
your
seeking
and
do
from
my
heart
pity
you
i
would
by
no
means
have
you
guilty
of
a
breach
of
duty
to
our
mother
but
for
heaven
sake
why
do
you
try
your
influence
over
her
to
have
this
sudden
scheme
of
matrimony
suspended
till
she
sees
and
talks
to
this
girl
that
faulkland
refers
her
to
if
the
wench
owns
that
he
was
not
to
blame
so
much
as
she
herself
was
and
relinquishes
all
pretensions
to
him
do
you
think
she
my
mother
i
mean
would
in
that
case
remain
bound
in
honour
to
yield
you
to
his
prior
claim
indeed
sidney
i
must
blame
you
for
this
part
of
your
conduct
it
looks
like
a
strange
insensibility
in
you
i
know
you
will
urge
your
perfect
submission
to
your
will
and
i
know
too
that
is
as
absolute
as
that
of
an
eastern
monarch
i
therefore
repeat
it
i
do
not
mean
to
reproach
you
with
your
compliance
but
i
am
vexed
to
the
heart
and
must
give
it
vent
i
see
plainly
that
old
piece
of
formality
lady
infernal
shrivelled
paw
in
all
this
for
my
mother
of
herself
i
am
sure
would
not
have
thought
of
disposing
of
you
without
your
liking
so
soon
after
an
affair
that
had
created
you
so
much
uneasiness
unless
it
had
been
suggested
to
her
by
somebody
prithee
tell
me
what
sort
of
man
this
arnold
really
is
for
i
do
not
depend
on
the
partial
representations
i
have
had
of
him
i
wish
miss
were
come
to
town
but
she
is
not
yet
arrived
i
enquired
for
her
of
faulkland
housekeeper
by
the
name
of
jefferis
the
woman
is
at
the
house
at
putney
waiting
to
receive
her
but
does
not
know
how
soon
she
will
come
would
she
had
been
buried
before
faulkland
saw
her
i
shall
expect
a
letter
from
you
soon
how
comes
it
that
you
never
mentioned
mr
arnold
to
me
in
any
that
you
have
writ
but
i
excuse
you
and
am
your
affectionate
brother
you
see
this
is
sir
george
himself
my
dear
a
mixture
of
petulancy
and
indelicacy
there
is
one
thing
in
him
however
commendable
his
steady
adherence
to
his
friend
interests
you
find
how
impossible
for
me
it
is
to
shew
such
a
letter
to
my
mother
by
his
strange
unguarded
manner
of
writing
which
he
does
not
consider
he
defeats
his
own
purposes
for
if
any
use
could
be
made
of
that
part
of
his
letter
relative
to
miss
i
could
not
shew
my
mother
part
without
letting
her
see
the
whole
but
that
is
not
to
be
done
and
i
can
only
thank
my
good
fortune
that
i
received
this
and
the
last
letter
from
him
without
her
knowlege
i
will
now
give
you
my
answer
to
this
letter
which
i
wrote
by
the
return
of
the
post
dear
brother
i
thank
you
for
your
condolements
but
can
assure
you
my
heart
is
not
in
such
a
situation
as
to
require
any
i
own
i
had
all
the
esteem
for
mr
faulkland
which
i
thought
his
merit
deserved
duty
to
my
good
mother
and
an
undeniable
blemish
in
his
character
first
wrought
a
change
in
my
sentiments
towards
him
my
own
peace
of
mind
now
requires
me
to
improve
that
change
into
indifference
you
do
me
justice
in
supposing
that
i
should
never
think
of
seeking
a
husband
and
you
have
formed
as
right
a
judgment
in
regard
to
lady
grimston
being
the
promoter
of
this
union
as
for
mr
arnold
though
perhaps
had
i
never
known
your
friend
he
might
not
have
been
the
man
of
my
choice
yet
have
i
no
dislike
to
him
i
believe
him
to
be
a
very
worthy
gentleman
and
that
my
mother
has
not
been
partial
in
her
representations
i
am
sure
at
least
she
has
said
nothing
of
him
but
what
she
has
seen
or
been
told
and
has
good
reason
to
believe
i
wish
dear
brother
you
had
writ
with
more
caution
that
i
might
have
laid
before
my
mother
what
you
said
in
relation
to
miss
b
it
may
have
its
weight
with
me
though
i
can
not
answer
for
its
having
any
with
her
do
you
forget
her
having
told
me
that
she
conceived
a
sort
of
horror
at
the
thoughts
of
my
marrying
mr
faulkland
she
can
not
but
be
sensible
that
miss
is
not
without
her
share
of
blame
in
that
affair
which
has
so
perplexed
us
all
but
you
know
too
that
does
not
exculpate
mr
faulkland
the
young
relinquishing
her
hopes
for
a
claim
i
think
she
does
not
make
would
only
the
more
excite
my
mother
compassion
and
interest
her
in
her
favour
to
sum
up
the
whole
in
one
word
my
mother
is
resolved
and
you
yourself
acknowlege
that
her
will
is
absolute
she
has
used
the
most
irresistible
argument
to
obtain
my
consent
that
it
would
make
happy
spare
then
my
dear
brother
unkind
reflections
on
any
part
of
my
behaviour
for
i
am
determined
to
pursue
through
life
that
rule
of
conduct
which
i
have
hitherto
invariably
adhered
to
i
mean
that
of
preferring
to
my
own
the
happiness
of
those
who
are
most
dear
to
me
i
am
mr
arnold
has
so
many
advocates
here
that
his
interest
can
not
fail
of
being
promoted
mrs
vere
admires
him
the
dean
commends
him
my
mother
praises
him
lady
grimston
extols
him
to
the
skies
no
one
is
silent
but
the
young
girl
that
i
mentioned
to
you
before
she
only
colours
and
hangs
down
her
head
when
he
is
spoken
of
i
really
begin
to
fear
that
the
poor
thing
loves
him
but
he
never
made
any
addresses
to
her
and
i
hope
does
not
suspect
it
things
are
now
gone
so
far
that
my
mother
and
lady
grimston
talked
to
day
of
settlements
mr
arnold
receives
but
twelve
hundred
pounds
a
year
from
his
estate
his
brother
widow
as
i
have
already
told
you
having
a
jointure
upon
it
of
three
hundred
pounds
a
year
she
lives
intirely
in
london
and
is
i
am
told
a
very
imprudent
woman
and
not
at
all
esteemed
by
the
family
the
elder
mr
arnold
and
she
were
married
several
years
but
never
had
a
child
the
last
two
years
of
his
life
his
wife
and
he
lived
separate
her
conduct
having
given
room
for
some
suspicions
very
injurious
to
her
husband
honour
the
arnold
estate
was
originally
a
very
considerable
one
but
has
been
dissipated
by
the
extravagance
of
the
successive
possessors
what
remains
however
is
quite
clear
and
is
likely
to
be
kept
so
by
the
good
management
of
the
present
owner
his
late
brother
was
exceedingly
remiss
in
his
affairs
and
spent
most
of
his
time
in
london
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
mr
arnold
the
would
have
fallen
to
the
ground
but
his
brother
lent
it
to
him
and
he
kept
it
in
repair
for
his
own
use
as
he
is
fond
of
the
place
though
he
has
a
pretty
house
in
kent
belonging
to
another
estate
of
about
three
hundred
pounds
a
year
which
came
to
him
by
his
mother
for
he
is
the
son
of
a
second
marriage
and
this
till
his
brother
death
was
the
whole
of
his
income
but
he
is
so
good
an
oeconomist
that
he
always
made
a
genteeler
figure
on
his
three
hundred
pounds
a
year
than
his
brother
did
on
twelve
my
mother
who
you
know
is
integrity
itself
thinks
that
i
ought
not
to
have
more
settled
on
me
than
the
widow
of
mr
arnold
brother
had
whose
fortune
was
superior
to
mine
mr
arnold
makes
a
much
handsomer
proposal
lady
grimston
is
for
laying
hold
of
it
the
dean
was
for
striking
a
medium
i
do
not
care
how
they
settle
it
but
i
fancy
my
mother
will
have
her
own
way
in
this
she
purposes
going
to
town
next
week
that
the
wedding
bless
me
whose
wedding
is
it
that
i
am
talking
of
so
coolly
well
that
it
may
be
celebrated
in
her
own
house
this
to
be
sure
will
send
sir
george
directly
out
of
it
i
can
not
help
it
i
am
born
to
give
and
to
receive
vexation
mr
arnold
speaks
of
taking
a
house
in
london
where
my
mother
is
to
have
an
apartment
whenever
she
chuses
to
be
in
town
this
is
a
pleasing
circumstance
to
me
and
she
likewise
proposes
our
being
sometimes
with
her
at
that
is
a
prospect
which
loses
much
of
its
charms
by
the
reflection
that
my
dear
cecilia
is
not
there
all
preliminaries
are
settled
there
has
been
a
fuss
with
parchments
this
week
past
my
mother
has
carried
her
point
in
regard
to
the
jointure
and
has
made
choice
of
that
little
estate
in
kent
to
be
settled
on
me
as
it
is
a
complete
three
hundred
pounds
a
year
detached
intirely
from
the
rest
and
has
a
pretty
house
on
it
this
was
all
she
would
accept
of
though
to
do
mr
arnold
justice
he
would
have
been
much
more
liberal
but
my
mother
says
a
single
woman
bred
in
retirement
as
i
have
been
who
can
not
live
on
that
does
not
deserve
to
live
at
all
adding
that
as
the
estate
was
already
subject
to
one
jointure
and
the
widow
so
young
a
woman
if
it
should
be
also
my
misfortune
to
become
one
early
a
great
part
of
the
fortune
would
be
swallowed
by
dowagers
and
the
heir
not
have
enough
to
support
his
rank
this
morning
my
mother
lady
grimston
the
dean
and
mr
arnold
who
is
the
idol
of
them
all
took
a
rumbling
together
in
the
old
coach
by
way
of
taking
the
air
in
a
dusty
road
and
what
do
you
think
was
the
result
of
their
deliberations
in
this
jaunt
why
truly
lady
grimston
proud
of
her
would
needs
see
it
accomplished
and
nothing
will
serve
her
but
i
must
be
married
at
her
house
my
mother
opposed
it
at
first
but
the
dean
seconded
the
proposal
that
he
might
have
as
he
expressed
himself
the
satisfaction
of
contributing
to
make
mr
arnold
happy
and
mr
arnold
audaciously
expecting
i
suppose
that
this
would
hasten
the
ceremony
joined
his
intreaties
so
effectually
that
my
mother
was
obliged
to
yield
what
a
tormenting
old
woman
is
this
lady
grimston
i
hoped
at
least
for
the
respite
of
a
month
by
getting
to
london
i
thought
first
to
have
delayed
the
time
of
our
going
to
town
and
then
to
have
faddled
away
a
good
while
longer
under
pretence
of
preparations
though
there
is
but
little
room
for
that
now
as
all
my
fineries
destined
i
thought
to
another
purpose
are
lying
quietly
in
my
trunks
at
home
but
then
one
might
have
contrived
many
little
occasions
of
delay
there
was
a
house
to
be
fixed
upon
and
i
had
twenty
things
to
do
and
as
my
mother
says
many
things
fall
out
between
the
cup
and
the
lip
but
all
my
expectations
are
blown
away
and
i
have
but
one
poor
fortnight
given
me
to
recollect
my
scattered
thoughts
when
they
are
all
to
be
centered
in
mr
arnold
i
am
not
merry
my
cecilia
but
i
am
determined
not
to
appear
sad
neither
am
i
so
i
hope
i
have
no
reason
my
mother
purposes
writing
again
to
sir
george
to
desire
his
presence
at
my
marriage
i
hope
he
will
behave
respectfully
to
every
one
here
if
he
should
come
mr
arnold
has
writ
to
town
to
bespeak
a
new
chariot
he
will
do
nothing
in
regard
to
the
house
till
i
am
on
the
spot
to
please
myself
i
intend
sending
patty
to
town
to
bring
me
down
my
bridal
trappings
mr
arnold
has
given
some
necessary
orders
for
the
new
decking
of
his
person
as
well
as
some
of
the
apartments
in
the
old
which
seem
a
little
to
want
refurnishing
most
of
the
goods
having
been
inhabitants
there
since
the
time
of
his
great
grandfather
my
mother
last
letter
to
sir
george
has
produced
the
following
answer
which
he
sent
by
patty
when
she
returned
down
here
with
my
cloaths
madam
i
am
sorry
i
can
not
accept
of
the
invitation
you
favour
me
with
to
be
present
at
my
sister
nuptials
some
affairs
in
wiltshire
require
my
immediate
attendance
and
i
had
settled
matters
before
i
received
your
summons
so
as
to
set
out
as
on
this
day
i
wish
you
all
imaginable
satisfaction
in
your
new
and
my
sister
abundance
of
happiness
in
her
spouse
i
am
madam
october
i
am
glad
sir
george
does
not
come
down
i
am
sure
if
he
did
his
behaviour
would
be
such
as
would
render
him
no
very
acceptable
guest
at
a
week
but
a
short
week
to
come
before
my
fate
is
irrevocably
fixed
or
revocable
only
by
the
hand
of
death
this
reflection
solemn
as
it
is
does
not
alarm
me
because
after
again
calling
my
heart
to
the
strictest
account
i
think
i
pronounce
it
intirely
free
mr
arnold
will
soon
have
an
indisputable
right
to
it
and
it
is
my
firm
purpose
to
use
my
utmost
endeavours
to
give
him
intire
possession
of
it
he
every
day
gains
upon
my
esteem
if
his
talents
are
not
so
glittering
as
i
have
seen
some
others
possessed
of
he
is
nevertheless
master
of
an
exceedingly
good
understanding
which
a
sort
of
diffidence
in
his
manner
does
not
suffer
him
to
shew
at
once
to
the
best
advantage
his
temper
is
extremely
sweet
and
he
seems
to
have
an
openness
of
heart
when
he
throws
off
a
little
shyness
which
he
has
contracted
that
is
exceedingly
engaging
his
love
for
me
appears
as
fervent
as
i
believe
it
sincere
and
i
should
be
ungrateful
not
to
do
my
utmost
to
return
it
how
precipitate
has
been
my
fortune
twice
within
these
three
months
have
i
been
almost
at
the
eve
of
my
intended
nuptials
those
which
to
have
been
i
thought
as
certain
as
those
which
are
to
be
solemnized
within
two
days
who
knows
what
may
still
happen
to
frustrate
our
present
designs
no
there
is
not
another
miss
to
interpose
mr
arnold
seems
to
be
one
of
those
who
are
born
to
pass
quietly
through
life
he
has
already
attained
to
the
age
of
thirty
without
one
event
ever
happening
to
him
but
such
as
happen
to
every
man
every
day
may
no
future
storm
ever
interrupt
his
or
my
tranquility
for
they
will
soon
be
one
and
the
same
thing
the
die
is
thrown
my
cecilia
and
thy
sidney
is
the
wife
of
mr
arnold
this
day
we
were
married
the
good
dean
joined
our
hands
and
his
daughter
was
one
of
my
the
poor
girl
was
taken
ill
during
the
ceremony
and
was
obliged
to
leave
the
church
which
has
confirmed
me
in
my
suspicions
oh
how
i
pity
her
i
believe
indeed
she
only
feigned
illness
for
an
excuse
to
retire
mrs
vere
went
out
with
her
but
she
would
not
suffer
her
to
attend
her
home
she
promised
to
dine
with
us
if
she
should
be
better
and
so
she
did
and
seemed
chearful
and
pretty
well
but
i
thought
she
looked
as
if
she
had
been
crying
she
made
my
heart
ache
but
i
am
in
hopes
it
is
but
a
slight
wound
she
is
exceedingly
lively
and
i
dare
say
will
soon
get
the
better
of
it
lady
grimston
was
downright
tiresome
with
her
compliments
and
preached
an
hour
long
about
the
duty
of
children
to
their
parents
and
how
good
a
wife
that
woman
was
likely
to
make
who
had
always
been
exemplary
in
her
filial
obedience
ah
lady
grimston
thought
i
by
what
i
have
heard
of
you
you
did
not
seem
to
number
obedience
amongst
virtues
in
your
own
case
though
you
can
preach
it
up
to
others
but
i
knew
this
sermon
was
chiefly
intended
for
poor
mrs
vere
use
my
mother
was
all
kindness
and
complacency
she
seemed
so
delighted
that
i
rejoiced
in
having
had
it
in
my
power
to
give
her
so
much
happiness
lady
grimston
did
the
honours
of
her
house
on
this
occasion
with
great
magnificence
and
i
believe
i
need
not
tell
you
with
most
exquisite
decorum
indeed
this
wedding
was
conducted
with
such
a
decent
festivity
so
rationally
on
all
sides
and
such
a
comfortable
privacy
that
i
was
not
half
so
much
shocked
as
i
expected
to
have
been
we
have
no
company
here
besides
the
family
of
the
house
my
dear
good
old
dean
his
lady
and
daughter
one
young
lady
more
and
a
relation
of
mr
arnold
a
gentleman
who
came
from
london
on
purpose
to
be
present
on
this
as
it
is
called
joyful
occasion
we
shall
leave
this
house
mr
arnold
and
i
i
mean
i
am
to
be
put
into
possession
of
the
old
mansion
of
my
mother
is
to
continue
with
lady
grimston
a
week
or
a
fortnight
longer
and
then
she
goes
to
london
on
no
other
call
as
she
says
but
to
see
and
administer
comfort
to
poor
miss
who
she
supposes
will
be
by
that
time
come
to
her
retreat
i
believe
i
shall
remain
in
the
country
while
the
weather
continues
pleasant
but
am
not
yet
determined
we
took
leave
of
lady
grimston
this
morning
or
rather
of
her
house
for
her
ladyship
my
dear
mother
and
all
the
good
folks
that
were
our
guests
at
are
to
dine
with
us
at
i
desired
i
might
be
permitted
to
go
home
without
any
parade
and
in
as
private
a
manner
as
possible
for
you
know
how
i
hate
a
bustle
mr
arnold
very
obligingly
indulged
me
in
this
request
and
conducted
my
sweet
mrs
vere
and
me
home
in
his
coach
at
eight
of
the
clock
this
morning
i
found
every
thing
in
exact
order
at
the
house
is
very
spacious
and
convenient
though
very
some
of
the
rooms
however
are
newly
fitted
up
perfectly
neat
and
handsome
the
servants
are
orderly
and
and
every
thing
seems
to
be
exactly
well
regulated
you
may
be
sure
i
have
taken
my
own
patty
home
with
me
i
intend
to
constitute
her
housekeeper
and
give
her
an
additional
salary
for
her
additional
trouble
mr
arnold
had
nobody
in
that
capacity
before
as
his
household
had
not
been
settled
since
the
acquisition
of
his
fortune
and
he
reserved
the
chusing
of
so
material
a
domestic
to
me
but
as
i
do
not
love
to
multiply
servants
and
know
that
patty
is
very
capable
of
the
place
i
shall
take
no
other
visitors
still
in
abundance
all
the
gentry
in
the
neighbourhood
for
some
miles
about
have
been
to
pay
us
their
compliments
at
least
i
hope
by
this
time
they
have
been
here
for
we
have
not
had
a
minute
to
ourselves
these
three
days
it
will
take
me
up
ten
to
return
them
as
many
of
the
families
live
at
a
good
distance
from
hence
mr
arnold
whose
mourning
has
been
laid
aside
since
our
wedding
day
seems
to
have
a
very
good
taste
in
dress
he
is
perfectly
well
shaped
and
appears
to
great
advantage
in
colours
in
short
he
is
more
amiable
than
i
thought
he
was
it
is
with
great
pleasure
that
i
observe
my
young
acquaintance
on
whose
heart
i
feared
mr
arnold
had
made
an
impression
has
recovered
her
usual
vivacity
with
people
extremely
full
of
spirits
love
is
not
apt
to
sink
very
deep
or
last
long
when
it
does
not
meet
with
a
return
my
mother
sets
out
for
london
and
mr
arnold
has
proposed
to
me
that
he
and
i
should
accompany
her
he
says
he
wants
to
look
out
for
a
house
and
should
like
to
fix
in
one
before
the
weather
advances
and
that
we
may
take
up
our
abode
at
my
mother
till
our
house
is
ready
for
us
my
mother
is
charmed
at
this
proposal
she
dreads
the
thought
of
parting
with
me
and
as
she
intends
going
after
a
convenient
stay
in
london
down
to
if
i
remain
here
our
separation
must
be
immediate
i
know
this
is
mr
arnold
kind
reason
for
desiring
me
to
go
he
thinks
i
shall
be
less
affected
at
parting
with
my
mother
when
in
the
midst
of
the
various
scenes
which
london
affords
than
i
should
be
if
i
were
to
continue
here
he
does
not
give
this
for
a
reason
but
i
know
it
is
his
true
one
for
he
is
not
fond
of
london
himself
especially
at
a
season
of
the
year
when
the
country
is
so
much
more
agreeable
i
thanked
him
for
this
mark
of
his
tenderness
and
am
determined
to
go
once
more
returned
to
london
in
very
good
spirits
after
a
stay
of
little
more
than
two
months
in
essex
in
which
time
so
material
and
unexpected
a
change
has
been
made
in
my
condition
lady
grimston
took
a
most
affectionate
leave
of
my
mother
and
asked
her
with
more
tenderness
than
i
thought
her
capable
of
how
many
ages
would
it
be
before
they
should
meet
again
as
for
mr
arnold
and
me
she
considers
us
her
neighbours
the
dean
pleases
himself
with
that
expectation
too
and
the
dear
mrs
vere
who
shed
tears
at
bidding
me
adieu
promises
herself
the
happiness
as
she
kindly
expressed
herself
of
spending
many
delightful
days
with
me
next
summer
she
set
out
on
her
return
to
her
own
house
at
the
same
time
that
we
left
ours
to
go
to
town
my
brother
is
still
in
wiltshire
but
i
find
he
did
not
leave
town
at
the
time
he
mentioned
in
his
letter
to
my
mother
nor
for
some
days
after
this
patty
learnt
from
the
servants
but
i
hope
it
will
not
come
to
my
mother
ears
for
she
would
take
it
extremely
ill
of
him
mr
arnold
for
the
first
time
mentioned
that
he
was
very
much
disappointed
in
not
having
had
the
honour
of
seeing
sir
george
at
his
house
in
the
country
but
he
hoped
when
he
came
to
town
his
brother
and
he
should
make
up
for
this
by
being
the
more
together
i
wish
sir
george
may
behave
as
he
ought
to
this
deserving
brother
mr
arnold
little
imagines
how
much
he
was
an
enemy
to
this
match
and
much
less
his
reason
for
it
i
should
be
very
sorry
mr
arnold
were
to
know
how
near
i
was
being
married
to
another
man
it
might
give
a
delicate
mind
pain
lest
there
should
remain
any
traces
of
this
former
attachment
in
the
breast
of
the
woman
he
loves
but
i
hope
there
is
no
danger
of
his
hearing
of
it
certainly
no
one
would
be
so
indiscreet
as
to
mention
it
to
him
mr
arnold
has
lived
chiefly
in
the
country
and
may
never
have
heard
of
mr
faulkland
as
he
was
so
short
a
time
returned
from
his
travels
on
which
he
had
been
absent
more
than
five
years
and
as
he
is
now
out
of
the
kingdom
probably
he
will
not
be
spoken
of
i
have
begged
of
my
mother
who
is
naturally
communicative
never
to
name
mr
faulkland
to
mr
arnold
and
have
given
my
reasons
for
desiring
this
she
says
she
thinks
it
would
be
better
to
tell
him
the
whole
affair
at
once
but
i
can
not
agree
with
her
in
that
opinion
and
have
at
last
prevailed
on
her
to
promise
me
she
will
not
speak
of
it
my
mother
drove
out
in
my
new
chariot
a
very
gay
fine
one
it
is
and
went
to
putney
to
enquire
after
miss
by
the
name
of
mrs
jefferis
she
soon
found
the
house
a
very
neat
box
with
a
pretty
garden
behind
it
the
door
was
opened
by
a
servant
maid
and
my
mother
being
told
the
lady
was
at
home
sent
in
her
name
and
was
immediately
conducted
up
stairs
into
a
very
elegant
little
where
the
lady
was
sitting
at
her
toilet
and
mr
faulkland
housekeeper
whom
my
mother
had
seen
before
assisting
to
dress
her
head
on
my
entering
the
room
miss
rose
off
her
chair
and
soon
discovered
by
her
shape
for
she
was
without
her
stays
that
it
was
high
time
for
her
to
seek
a
place
of
concealment
the
housekeeper
immediately
withdrew
and
the
young
lady
seemed
in
the
utmost
confusion
my
mother
says
she
herself
was
at
a
loss
how
to
begin
the
conversation
but
miss
relieved
her
and
spoke
first
she
thanked
her
for
the
honour
she
did
her
by
so
charitable
a
visit
which
she
said
mr
faulkland
had
long
ago
made
her
hope
for
and
which
she
must
consider
as
the
greatest
consolation
in
her
present
unhappy
circumstances
my
mother
placed
herself
by
her
madam
said
she
mr
faulkland
made
it
a
point
with
me
before
he
left
england
that
i
should
see
you
and
afford
you
all
the
assistance
in
my
power
or
that
you
should
stand
in
need
of
you
seem
to
be
commodiously
situated
here
and
i
understand
have
a
very
careful
good
woman
to
attend
you
i
have
so
madam
she
answered
but
the
most
material
circumstance
is
wanting
to
my
relief
mr
faulkland
he
is
not
here
tears
started
into
her
eyes
as
she
spoke
you
were
apprised
of
his
absence
said
my
mother
before
you
came
to
town
i
was
madam
and
with
the
cause
of
it
she
hung
down
her
head
and
was
silent
my
mother
reassumed
the
conversation
she
told
her
she
thought
it
a
most
providential
discovery
that
had
given
her
the
knowlege
of
mr
faulkland
ill
behaviour
time
enough
to
prevent
his
marriage
with
her
daughter
assuring
her
she
would
not
for
the
universe
have
had
me
the
wife
of
a
man
under
such
ties
as
she
must
consider
mr
faulkland
to
be
miss
brightned
up
a
little
upon
my
mother
saying
this
did
mr
faulkland
ever
tell
you
madam
how
the
unhappy
affair
happened
my
mother
told
her
she
knew
not
particulars
that
she
had
been
referred
to
her
for
a
full
explanation
that
mr
faulkland
had
always
endeavoured
to
excuse
himself
and
went
so
far
as
to
say
he
was
sure
the
lady
herself
would
acquit
him
in
a
great
measure
ah
madam
miss
cried
and
shook
her
head
is
as
i
suspected
said
my
mother
mr
faulkland
is
an
ungenerous
man
a
young
lady
of
your
modest
appearance
i
am
sure
he
must
have
taken
more
pains
to
seduce
than
he
will
acknowlege
miss
b
blushed
exceedingly
oh
madam
you
have
a
charitable
generous
heart
i
was
seduced
i
knew
it
replied
my
mother
did
he
promise
to
marry
you
she
coloured
deeper
than
before
i
will
not
accuse
him
of
that
madam
my
mother
proceeded
you
have
a
relation
madam
i
understand
she
was
accessary
to
your
misfortune
yes
the
barbarous
woman
answered
the
lady
she
was
the
contriver
of
my
destruction
and
if
i
could
have
avoided
it
i
would
never
have
seen
her
face
again
tears
of
grief
and
indignation
again
burst
from
her
eyes
have
comfort
madam
said
my
mother
all
may
end
well
yet
i
can
have
no
hopes
answered
miss
mr
faulkland
flies
me
you
see
nor
can
i
ever
expect
to
recover
his
heart
since
so
charming
a
young
lady
as
i
hear
miss
bidulph
is
has
possession
of
it
and
though
your
goodness
disappointed
him
in
his
late
views
he
may
not
yet
despair
i
found
by
this
continued
my
mother
that
miss
b
knew
nothing
of
your
being
married
and
made
haste
to
tell
her
i
never
saw
joy
so
visible
in
a
countenance
she
clasped
her
hands
together
dear
madam
what
do
you
tell
me
how
you
revive
my
drooping
heart
then
i
am
not
hopeless
there
is
a
in
my
favour
she
then
asked
my
mother
if
mr
faulkland
had
acquainted
her
with
her
real
name
or
that
of
her
relation
my
mother
who
had
once
or
twice
called
her
by
the
name
of
jefferis
assured
her
he
had
not
that
was
generous
in
him
said
she
he
be
generous
in
points
but
i
have
no
reason
to
conceal
it
from
so
prudent
and
worthy
a
lady
as
you
are
my
real
name
is
burchell
that
of
my
cruel
relation
i
will
forbear
to
mention
out
of
respect
to
my
good
uncle
whose
wife
she
is
mr
faulkland
she
added
left
a
bill
of
five
hundred
pounds
with
his
housekeeper
to
provide
every
thing
for
me
that
i
should
want
with
assurances
that
he
would
take
the
tenderest
care
of
the
poor
young
creature
hesitated
and
could
proceed
no
farther
but
my
mother
said
she
understood
her
meaning
they
had
a
good
deal
more
discourse
my
mother
promised
to
see
her
often
during
her
confinement
and
took
her
leave
she
tells
me
she
is
extremely
pretty
and
has
such
an
air
of
innocence
and
simplicity
as
very
much
engages
one
in
her
favour
i
have
set
down
this
whole
conversation
with
every
other
particular
exactly
as
my
mother
related
it
she
who
has
a
most
circumstantial
memory
repeated
it
word
for
word
and
i
from
a
custom
of
throwing
upon
paper
every
thing
that
occurs
to
me
have
habituated
myself
to
retain
the
minutest
things
i
know
not
my
dear
whether
you
will
be
of
my
opinion
but
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
there
was
something
like
art
in
miss
behaviour
far
from
that
candour
which
mr
faulkland
seemed
to
expect
from
her
my
mother
mentioned
the
that
she
supposed
had
been
taken
to
her
her
deep
blush
at
this
hint
makes
me
suspect
that
her
answer
was
not
dictated
by
sincerity
she
saw
my
mother
was
not
acquainted
with
the
particulars
and
that
she
was
willing
to
pass
a
favourable
judgment
on
her
fault
it
looks
to
me
as
if
she
laid
hold
of
this
prejudice
and
yet
she
that
mr
faulkland
had
never
promised
to
marry
her
i
know
not
what
to
think
but
there
appears
to
me
upon
the
whole
something
evasive
and
disingenuous
in
her
conduct
my
mother
who
is
all
openness
and
integrity
saw
it
not
in
this
light
but
be
it
as
it
may
it
is
no
longer
of
any
consequence
to
me
which
was
most
to
blame
the
gentleman
or
the
lady
miss
burchell
is
certainly
the
injured
person
perhaps
i
too
may
have
wronged
her
in
my
surmises
if
i
have
i
beg
her
pardon
the
observations
i
have
made
on
her
behaviour
are
only
and
i
do
from
my
heart
wish
mr
faulkland
would
make
her
his
wife
you
may
perceive
from
what
i
have
told
you
how
little
this
interview
was
likely
to
produce
in
mr
faulkland
favour
had
it
even
been
brought
about
sooner
my
mother
is
now
more
than
ever
confirmed
in
her
opinion
that
the
poor
young
creature
has
been
deceived
and
she
prays
that
mr
faulkland
may
not
be
overtaken
with
a
judgment
which
she
thinks
nothing
but
his
marrying
the
girl
can
avert
we
have
at
length
fixed
upon
a
house
to
our
liking
a
handsome
convenient
one
in
st
we
are
preparing
to
get
it
furnished
as
fast
as
we
can
that
we
may
go
into
it
for
if
my
brother
should
come
to
town
i
know
being
with
my
mother
will
be
an
objection
to
his
lodging
in
her
house
this
i
should
be
sorry
for
as
she
told
him
he
might
make
use
of
it
while
it
remained
in
her
hands
thank
my
stars
i
have
got
over
the
fatigue
of
receiving
and
paying
a
second
round
of
bridal
visits
and
i
am
really
so
tired
of
it
that
uninviting
as
the
season
is
i
could
wish
myself
in
quiet
at
but
i
can
not
think
of
leaving
london
while
my
mother
continues
in
it
and
she
is
now
resolved
to
do
so
till
miss
burchell
or
rather
on
this
occasion
mrs
jefferis
is
brought
you
imagine
how
sollicitous
she
is
about
her
every
time
she
sees
her
she
seems
more
and
more
pleased
with
her
i
am
very
glad
it
has
happened
so
for
the
poor
young
woman
sake
my
mother
is
as
warm
in
her
attachments
as
in
her
resentments
she
visits
her
almost
every
second
day
for
the
poor
thing
it
seems
is
ill
at
present
and
ca
leave
her
chamber
she
tells
me
she
is
extremely
melancholy
and
seems
much
to
dread
the
approaching
hour
i
greatly
honour
my
mother
for
her
humanity
towards
her
in
her
terrifying
situation
she
must
want
the
tenderness
of
a
as
well
as
a
sensible
friend
for
it
must
be
a
melancholy
thing
in
such
circumstances
to
have
no
one
about
her
but
servants
and
those
strangers
too
she
told
my
mother
that
her
altered
looks
and
frequent
sicknesses
gave
her
aunt
who
was
privy
to
the
cause
of
it
a
pretence
for
asking
her
uncle
permission
for
miss
to
go
to
bath
which
she
told
him
would
do
her
more
good
than
any
thing
he
consented
and
supposed
she
was
actually
gone
thither
under
the
care
of
a
lady
whom
her
aunt
named
who
was
really
going
there
in
order
to
settle
for
life
and
to
whose
house
she
went
for
a
day
or
two
to
give
a
colour
to
this
story
her
aunt
contrived
that
she
should
not
take
any
servant
with
her
giving
it
for
a
reason
that
as
she
might
be
as
well
attended
by
the
lady
servants
with
whom
she
lodged
and
be
considered
by
her
as
one
of
the
family
a
maid
would
only
be
an
unnecessary
incumbrance
she
added
that
her
uncle
was
so
afflicted
with
the
gout
that
he
never
stirred
abroad
and
saw
very
little
company
so
that
it
was
not
likely
he
should
ever
be
undeceived
we
have
just
received
a
very
odd
piece
of
news
that
i
own
has
a
little
alarmed
me
it
is
that
the
widow
of
mr
arnold
brother
is
found
to
be
with
child
there
was
no
mention
of
this
at
the
time
her
husband
died
nor
indeed
any
cause
to
suspect
it
but
the
strongest
presumptions
in
the
world
to
the
contrary
as
her
husband
and
she
lived
it
has
not
been
even
whispered
till
since
our
arrival
in
town
the
lady
pretends
that
she
was
not
conscious
of
it
herself
till
within
this
fortnight
yet
her
husband
has
been
dead
four
months
this
i
am
told
is
very
possible
though
not
very
common
she
has
herself
wrote
a
letter
to
mr
arnold
to
inform
him
of
it
at
the
same
time
declaring
that
she
and
her
late
husband
had
been
reconciled
a
little
before
his
death
and
that
had
he
recovered
she
was
to
have
lived
with
him
again
all
this
is
very
strange
the
elder
mr
arnold
killed
himself
with
excessive
drinking
his
death
approached
him
by
slow
degrees
but
as
he
could
never
be
persuaded
to
think
it
near
he
took
not
the
least
care
either
of
his
spiritual
or
temporal
concerns
his
brother
was
in
the
country
when
he
was
seized
with
his
last
illness
which
he
had
precipitated
by
some
extravagant
excess
he
was
almost
at
the
last
extremity
before
he
could
be
prevailed
on
to
let
a
physician
attend
him
or
suffer
his
brother
to
be
sent
for
in
regard
to
the
latter
he
told
those
about
him
that
as
he
was
his
heir
of
course
he
had
made
no
will
he
mentioned
not
his
wife
the
jointure
which
had
been
settled
on
her
he
allowed
her
for
a
separate
maintenance
they
had
for
a
long
time
pursued
separate
pleasures
and
none
of
his
friends
knew
that
they
had
ever
met
or
so
much
as
seen
one
another
from
the
time
they
parted
my
mr
arnold
arrived
in
town
just
time
enough
to
close
his
brother
eyes
he
was
speechless
when
he
came
and
expired
in
less
than
an
hour
after
he
entered
his
chamber
as
his
wife
had
been
very
obnoxious
to
the
family
there
was
little
notice
taken
of
her
by
them
more
than
what
common
forms
require
she
seemed
as
indifferent
about
the
death
of
her
husband
as
she
had
been
towards
him
in
his
and
did
not
then
hint
a
word
of
this
reconciliation
between
them
or
of
her
having
had
an
interview
with
him
i
am
told
she
is
a
very
weak
as
well
as
a
very
loose
woman
and
mr
arnold
thinks
she
has
got
into
the
hands
of
some
designing
person
however
that
matter
may
be
it
is
a
serious
affair
and
he
designs
to
take
the
opinion
of
an
eminent
lawyer
upon
it
my
poor
dear
mother
is
frightned
sadly
if
this
child
should
make
its
appearance
in
the
world
time
enough
to
prove
the
possibility
of
its
being
the
offspring
of
the
late
mr
arnold
she
says
it
must
be
considered
by
the
law
as
his
heir
notwithstanding
the
husband
and
wife
lived
apart
mr
arnold
laughs
or
affects
to
laugh
at
this
we
shall
however
wait
with
patience
till
the
lady
is
brought
to
bed
our
house
is
intirely
fitted
up
and
we
shall
remove
into
it
this
evening
my
mother
chuses
to
continue
in
her
own
though
mr
arnold
presses
her
to
accept
of
an
apartment
in
ours
but
we
shall
be
near
neighbours
and
she
does
not
like
to
change
we
have
received
the
opinion
of
our
lawyers
who
tell
us
that
in
case
the
child
should
be
born
within
such
a
period
of
time
as
to
give
colour
to
its
claim
yet
the
lady
must
prove
her
assertion
in
regard
to
the
pretended
meeting
between
her
and
her
husband
which
it
is
imagined
is
not
in
her
power
to
do
and
her
indifferent
character
together
with
several
favourable
circumstances
which
mr
arnold
has
on
his
side
makes
them
quite
sanguin
in
their
expectations
of
overturning
her
claim
we
are
however
likely
to
be
engaged
in
a
disagreeable
but
as
mr
arnold
seems
perfectly
easy
about
the
issue
of
it
i
will
make
myself
so
too
i
am
more
and
more
reconciled
to
my
lot
my
dear
cecilia
every
day
that
i
live
mr
arnold
assiduity
and
tenderness
towards
me
deserve
the
gratefullest
return
my
heart
can
make
him
and
i
am
convinced
it
is
not
necessary
to
be
passionately
in
love
with
the
man
we
marry
to
make
us
happy
constancy
good
sense
and
a
sweet
temper
must
form
a
basis
for
a
durable
felicity
the
two
latter
i
am
sure
mr
arnold
possesses
oh
may
i
never
experience
his
want
of
the
former
i
hope
my
own
conduct
will
for
ever
ensure
to
me
his
love
that
only
can
secure
the
tranquility
of
my
future
days
my
brother
arrived
in
town
last
night
and
came
this
morning
in
company
with
my
mother
and
i
am
sure
at
her
request
to
make
us
a
formal
visit
my
kind
mr
arnold
received
him
with
tenderness
sir
george
was
coldly
polite
he
owned
however
to
my
mother
upon
her
asking
him
his
opinion
of
his
that
he
seemed
to
be
a
clever
sort
of
a
i
wish
i
could
cultivate
a
friendship
between
them
it
will
not
be
mr
arnold
fault
if
there
is
not
but
sir
george
you
know
is
not
of
a
very
pliant
disposition
he
asked
my
mother
when
they
were
alone
whether
she
had
yet
seen
miss
b
or
mrs
jefferis
for
he
knew
her
by
no
other
name
and
what
she
had
to
say
for
herself
my
mother
told
him
he
had
better
not
touch
upon
that
string
i
will
be
hanged
replied
sir
george
if
the
artful
young
baggage
has
not
imposed
upon
you
my
mother
who
is
always
angry
at
having
her
sagacity
called
in
question
told
sir
george
he
was
rude
and
she
should
give
him
no
satisfaction
on
that
head
my
brother
answered
as
it
was
of
no
consequence
what
the
wench
affirmed
or
denied
he
had
no
farther
curiosity
about
her
my
mother
called
him
a
bear
and
so
the
enquiry
ended
i
congratulate
you
my
sister
my
friend
my
ever
beloved
cecilia
happy
happy
may
you
be
in
your
nuptials
but
in
the
midst
of
my
joy
for
your
being
so
nobly
and
worthily
bestowed
forces
a
sigh
from
me
i
have
lost
the
pleasing
hope
of
seeing
you
at
the
time
fixed
for
your
return
the
station
your
husband
holds
at
the
court
of
vienna
will
i
fear
long
detain
my
beloved
in
a
foreign
land
but
you
are
not
amongst
strangers
a
husband
a
brother
and
tender
parent
must
make
every
part
of
the
globe
equally
your
home
i
will
therefore
seek
for
my
contentment
in
your
and
rest
satisfied
with
believing
that
you
will
always
continue
to
love
me
i
begin
to
find
my
thoughts
so
dissipated
that
i
am
angry
with
myself
mr
arnold
excessive
indulgence
will
spoil
me
he
is
always
contriving
new
scenes
of
pleasure
and
hurries
me
from
one
to
the
other
i
do
not
wish
to
be
perpetually
fluttering
about
the
calm
domestic
life
you
know
was
always
my
choice
but
i
will
not
oppose
my
kind
mr
arnold
in
his
fond
desire
of
pleasing
me
besides
i
find
that
by
his
constantly
gallanting
me
to
public
places
he
begins
himself
to
acquire
a
sort
of
relish
for
them
which
he
did
not
use
to
have
at
least
his
prudence
made
him
so
to
conform
to
the
necessity
of
his
circumstances
while
his
fortune
was
small
that
he
never
indulged
himself
in
any
of
the
fashionable
expensive
amusements
nor
does
he
now
in
any
but
such
as
i
partake
of
with
him
i
find
he
is
by
nature
open
and
liberal
to
excess
i
must
take
care
without
his
being
conscious
of
it
to
be
a
gentle
check
upon
his
bounteous
spirit
i
mean
only
so
far
as
it
regards
myself
indeed
this
is
the
most
material
point
for
in
every
other
instance
his
generosity
is
regulated
by
prudence
i
am
every
hour
more
obliged
to
him
and
should
hate
myself
if
i
did
not
find
that
he
had
an
intire
possession
of
my
love
sir
george
hardly
ever
comes
near
us
but
by
formal
invitation
and
then
his
behaviour
to
mr
arnold
is
so
very
civil
and
so
very
distant
that
it
mortifies
me
exceedingly
mr
arnold
can
not
but
perceive
it
but
either
his
tenderness
for
me
makes
him
take
no
notice
of
it
or
else
not
being
well
enough
acquainted
with
my
brother
to
know
his
disposition
he
may
impute
his
coldness
to
his
natural
temper
my
mother
says
he
never
names
mr
faulkland
or
miss
burchell
to
her
i
wish
sir
george
could
entirely
forget
that
unhappy
affair
there
is
a
story
propagated
by
the
widow
arnold
about
the
meeting
between
her
and
her
husband
the
circumstances
of
which
are
as
follows
she
says
she
had
dined
one
day
in
the
city
and
was
returning
home
to
her
lodgings
in
in
a
hackney
coach
that
the
driver
by
his
carelessness
in
coming
along
the
strand
had
one
of
his
fore
wheels
taken
off
by
a
waggon
which
accident
obliged
her
to
alight
the
footboy
who
was
behind
the
coach
had
by
the
jolt
been
thrown
off
and
received
a
hurt
which
made
it
necessary
to
have
him
carried
into
a
shop
for
assistance
that
the
lady
herself
being
no
otherwise
injured
than
by
a
little
fright
found
that
she
was
so
near
home
that
she
did
not
think
it
worth
while
to
wait
for
another
carriage
but
pursued
her
way
on
foot
it
was
a
fine
dry
evening
about
nine
and
though
there
was
no
light
but
what
the
lamps
afforded
yet
as
the
streets
were
full
of
people
she
had
no
apprehensions
of
danger
in
this
situation
she
was
accosted
by
two
gentlemen
who
seeing
a
lady
well
dressed
and
alone
insisted
on
seeing
her
safe
to
her
lodgings
however
disagreeable
such
an
encounter
was
she
said
she
did
not
give
herself
much
concern
about
it
as
she
was
so
near
home
and
expected
to
shake
off
her
new
acquaintance
at
the
door
of
the
house
where
she
lodged
and
accordingly
when
she
got
there
she
told
them
she
was
at
home
and
wished
them
a
good
night
but
the
impertinents
were
not
so
easily
to
be
put
off
the
door
having
been
opened
by
the
maid
of
the
house
they
both
rushed
in
her
landlady
a
single
woman
happened
to
be
abroad
and
there
was
no
man
in
the
house
mrs
arnold
thought
she
had
no
way
left
but
to
run
up
to
her
and
lock
herself
in
but
in
this
she
was
prevented
as
the
gentlemen
whom
the
servant
of
the
house
vainly
endeavoured
to
oppose
got
up
stairs
almost
as
soon
as
she
did
her
own
maid
on
hearing
the
rap
at
the
door
had
lighted
candles
in
the
the
two
sparks
entered
with
her
but
how
was
she
surprized
to
find
that
one
of
them
was
her
husband
her
fright
she
said
had
prevented
her
from
discovering
this
sooner
as
she
had
not
looked
in
either
of
their
faces
though
there
was
a
light
in
the
hall
and
mr
arnold
being
half
drunk
she
supposed
was
the
reason
of
his
not
perceiving
sooner
who
she
was
the
astonishment
that
they
both
were
in
and
the
exclamation
that
each
made
in
their
turn
soon
informed
the
companion
of
mr
arnold
who
the
lady
was
he
congratulated
them
both
on
this
fortunate
mistake
and
saying
since
chance
had
been
so
propitious
to
mr
arnold
as
to
throw
him
into
the
arms
of
so
charming
a
woman
he
hoped
his
discovering
her
to
be
his
wife
would
not
render
her
the
less
agreeable
to
him
but
that
this
unexpected
meeting
might
be
a
means
of
them
in
their
former
amity
mr
arnold
she
says
in
the
presence
of
this
gentleman
advanced
with
open
arms
to
embrace
her
which
she
not
declining
his
friend
having
again
felicitated
them
on
their
reconciliation
took
his
leave
and
mr
arnold
remained
with
his
lady
that
at
parting
which
was
not
till
late
as
she
would
not
on
account
of
her
reputation
permit
him
to
pass
the
night
at
her
lodgings
he
promised
to
bring
her
home
to
his
house
in
a
day
or
two
but
unfortunately
for
her
he
was
taken
ill
in
the
interim
which
she
did
not
know
of
till
she
had
an
account
that
mr
arnold
had
lost
his
senses
the
reason
she
assigned
for
not
enquiring
after
him
sooner
was
that
her
pride
would
not
suffer
her
to
make
any
advances
to
a
man
who
had
been
so
injurious
as
to
part
with
her
and
she
thought
it
his
duty
to
recall
her
without
her
taking
any
step
towards
it
this
story
seems
plausible
yet
none
of
our
friends
believe
a
word
of
it
and
imagine
somebody
has
contrived
it
for
her
the
gentleman
who
was
the
companion
of
mr
arnold
that
night
she
says
can
at
a
proper
time
be
produced
as
a
witness
as
also
her
own
maid
who
can
testify
the
truth
of
this
story
in
the
mean
time
this
maid
is
kept
out
of
the
way
and
nobody
can
guess
at
the
gentleman
for
his
name
is
kept
a
profound
secret
i
am
delighted
at
the
sweetness
of
mr
arnold
temper
vexatious
as
this
affair
is
likely
to
be
even
at
the
best
he
does
not
suffer
it
to
interrupt
our
pleasures
or
his
own
good
humour
on
the
contrary
he
is
the
more
studious
of
promoting
every
thing
which
he
thinks
will
entertain
me
at
length
the
poor
miss
burchell
is
happily
rid
of
her
burden
a
pretty
little
boy
my
mother
says
it
is
it
was
immediately
after
its
birth
at
which
my
mother
was
present
privately
baptized
by
the
name
of
orlando
and
sent
away
with
its
nurse
a
careful
body
who
had
been
before
provided
for
it
it
passes
for
the
son
of
a
captain
jefferis
abroad
with
the
army
miss
burchell
would
never
suffer
the
nurse
to
see
her
for
as
she
intends
to
reassume
her
own
name
as
soon
as
she
shall
be
in
a
condition
to
leave
her
present
retirement
she
would
not
chuse
to
be
known
by
the
woman
in
case
of
her
going
to
see
her
child
every
thing
was
managed
with
so
much
privacy
and
miss
burchell
has
lived
so
perfectly
recluse
nobody
visiting
her
but
my
mother
that
in
all
probability
this
affair
will
always
remain
an
intire
secret
my
mother
says
that
as
soon
as
miss
burchell
to
whom
she
considers
herself
as
a
kind
of
patroness
is
tolerably
recovered
she
will
go
down
to
for
she
thinks
herself
in
a
strange
land
any
where
but
there
and
would
you
believe
it
my
dear
she
has
taken
such
a
fancy
to
miss
burchell
that
she
talks
of
inviting
her
down
with
her
if
she
can
obtain
her
uncle
leave
the
girl
must
certainly
have
some
very
amiable
qualities
so
to
captivate
my
mother
or
she
has
an
immensity
of
art
i
dare
say
the
young
lady
will
gladly
accept
of
her
invitation
it
will
undoubtedly
be
a
most
eligible
situation
for
her
i
do
not
know
what
sir
george
may
say
to
her
carrying
her
humanity
so
far
as
he
hates
the
name
of
this
poor
girl
but
no
matter
it
may
be
a
means
of
preserving
her
character
which
probably
she
might
not
long
keep
if
she
returned
to
live
with
so
vile
a
woman
as
i
conclude
her
aunt
to
be
nor
can
she
have
any
colour
for
quitting
her
whilst
her
uncle
lives
for
i
find
she
is
an
orphan
and
has
no
relation
but
him
she
must
however
go
home
for
a
while
in
order
to
get
leave
from
him
for
this
visit
to
i
am
told
the
widow
arnold
computes
the
time
of
her
about
the
latter
end
of
the
next
month
if
it
should
so
happen
she
saves
her
distance
as
her
husband
died
in
july
a
little
before
we
went
to
mr
arnold
treats
the
affair
very
lightly
and
is
only
concerned
at
seeing
my
mother
so
much
affected
by
it
for
my
part
i
form
my
behaviour
upon
mr
arnold
conduct
and
as
long
as
he
appears
easy
i
shall
certainly
be
so
too
my
brother
throws
out
some
unkind
reflections
he
says
he
wonders
the
old
sybil
at
did
not
foresee
this
and
congratulates
me
on
my
good
fortune
in
having
my
jointure
settled
on
that
part
of
the
estate
which
is
not
disputed
i
really
think
he
shews
a
sort
of
triumph
even
in
his
condolements
for
he
generally
concludes
them
with
thanking
his
stars
that
had
no
hand
in
the
match
i
trust
in
god
we
shall
none
of
us
have
any
cause
to
repent
it
i
am
sure
i
never
shall
for
if
mr
arnold
were
reduced
to
the
lowest
ebb
of
fortune
i
should
find
my
consolation
in
his
kindness
and
affection
my
mother
is
preparing
to
leave
town
miss
burchell
is
quite
recovered
and
purposes
going
down
to
the
country
to
obtain
her
uncle
consent
for
the
intended
visit
she
says
she
can
easily
tell
him
she
made
an
acquaintance
with
lady
bidulph
in
her
late
excursion
to
bath
from
whom
she
received
an
invitation
and
she
is
sure
he
will
not
refuse
to
let
her
accept
it
sir
george
laughs
exceedingly
at
this
plan
he
says
his
mother
ought
not
to
be
surprized
at
faulkland
falling
into
the
girl
snares
since
she
herself
has
done
the
same
but
he
supposes
my
mother
thinks
she
is
doing
a
very
meritorious
action
in
affording
an
asylum
to
this
injured
innocence
i
give
you
my
brother
words
for
i
assure
you
as
to
myself
i
approve
of
my
mother
kindness
to
her
and
think
it
may
be
a
means
of
preserving
the
girl
from
future
mischief
miss
burchell
is
gone
to
the
country
and
this
morning
for
the
first
time
severed
me
from
the
best
of
mothers
i
can
not
recover
my
spirits
i
have
wept
all
day
mr
arnold
ever
good
and
obliging
would
needs
accompany
her
some
miles
on
her
journey
you
may
be
sure
i
was
not
left
behind
sir
george
was
so
polite
as
to
say
he
would
escort
her
down
to
i
was
surprized
at
it
for
he
does
not
often
do
obliging
things
my
mother
gladly
accepted
of
his
company
and
said
she
would
make
him
her
prisoner
when
she
had
him
there
for
she
should
be
quite
melancholy
without
me
for
a
time
now
though
i
should
be
very
unwilling
not
to
allow
the
merit
of
a
action
to
sir
george
yet
do
i
attribute
this
in
some
measure
to
its
answering
a
purpose
of
convenience
to
himself
you
know
before
his
illness
sent
him
to
the
spa
he
always
spent
his
summers
with
us
at
the
castle
though
he
has
another
very
convenient
house
on
his
estate
when
he
was
in
london
he
never
had
any
thing
but
lodgings
for
which
i
have
often
been
angry
with
him
my
mother
since
his
return
made
him
a
compliment
of
her
house
but
as
the
time
she
took
it
for
is
now
expired
and
it
is
let
to
another
family
he
could
no
longer
continue
in
it
mr
arnold
in
the
most
affectionate
manner
pressed
him
to
accept
of
an
apartment
with
us
which
he
declined
now
as
he
could
not
without
shewing
us
an
apparent
slight
continue
in
town
in
other
lodgings
i
believe
he
for
this
reason
preferred
going
down
with
my
mother
be
it
as
it
may
i
am
very
glad
that
she
will
have
his
company
for
i
make
no
doubt
of
his
staying
with
her
some
time
unless
miss
burchell
should
frighten
him
away
i
have
been
so
cast
down
since
my
mother
departure
that
mr
obliging
tender
assiduity
to
please
and
entertain
me
seems
redoubled
but
indeed
i
am
wearied
with
a
continual
round
of
noisy
pleasures
and
long
to
get
back
to
i
hope
to
be
there
in
about
three
weeks
or
a
month
at
farthest
my
mother
has
dispensed
with
our
going
down
to
her
this
summer
she
thinks
it
might
be
attended
with
inconveniences
to
me
and
talks
of
coming
to
town
again
in
a
few
months
but
i
shall
insist
on
her
not
giving
herself
the
fatigue
of
so
long
a
journey
unless
she
comes
to
stay
all
the
next
winter
with
us
my
mother
writes
me
word
that
miss
burchell
has
obtained
leave
of
her
uncle
and
is
come
to
she
says
she
never
saw
a
better
behaved
young
creature
sir
george
has
taken
so
much
offence
at
her
coming
that
he
talks
of
going
to
his
own
house
my
mother
adds
behaves
however
with
manners
but
i
shall
not
press
him
to
stay
an
important
birth
my
cecilia
the
widow
arnold
has
produced
a
young
miss
i
assure
you
the
little
damsel
has
been
ushered
into
life
with
all
the
ceremony
due
to
a
young
heiress
and
her
mother
introduces
her
as
one
whom
an
unjust
uncle
debars
of
her
right
now
you
must
know
that
upon
an
exact
calculation
this
little
girl
has
made
her
appearance
just
twelve
days
later
than
she
ought
to
have
done
to
prove
her
legitimacy
dating
the
possibility
of
her
being
mr
arnold
from
the
very
day
whereon
he
took
that
illness
of
which
he
died
and
which
confined
him
for
five
days
to
his
bed
in
all
that
time
his
servants
never
left
him
for
a
minute
this
has
occasioned
various
speculations
our
lawyers
say
that
it
is
enough
to
destroy
her
pretensions
but
some
physicians
who
have
been
consulted
on
the
occasion
are
of
a
contrary
opinion
and
declare
they
have
known
instances
of
children
being
born
even
so
long
after
the
stated
time
alloted
by
nature
for
their
coming
into
life
it
is
a
very
unlucky
affair
and
has
involved
us
in
a
who
the
person
is
that
secretly
abets
the
widow
we
can
not
find
out
but
it
is
certain
she
has
somebody
every
one
believes
this
is
an
infamous
and
unjust
claim
and
the
woman
folly
almost
frees
her
from
the
suspicion
of
its
being
of
her
own
contriving
you
can
not
imagine
my
cecilia
how
happy
i
think
myself
after
such
a
hurrying
winter
as
i
have
had
to
find
myself
once
more
restored
to
my
favourite
pleasures
the
calm
delights
of
solitude
seems
a
paradise
to
me
now
lady
grimston
shewed
me
a
specimen
of
her
humour
this
morning
in
talking
of
the
widow
arnold
she
said
she
was
an
that
having
already
disgraced
the
family
now
wanted
to
beggar
them
but
that
if
mr
arnold
did
not
make
an
example
of
her
she
would
never
own
him
for
a
kinsman
my
chearful
old
dean
says
he
is
now
completely
happy
having
lived
to
see
his
daughter
married
while
we
were
in
town
very
much
to
his
and
her
satisfaction
i
am
heartily
glad
of
it
neither
am
i
sorry
for
her
sake
that
she
has
left
the
country
mrs
vere
is
come
to
spend
a
few
weeks
with
me
according
to
her
promise
she
is
a
truly
amiable
creature
her
disposition
so
gentle
her
temper
so
mild
such
a
sweet
humility
in
her
whole
deportment
that
it
astonishes
me
her
mother
can
still
persist
in
her
unkindness
to
her
but
the
eldest
daughter
was
always
her
darling
who
i
understand
is
pretty
much
of
her
mother
own
cast
and
makes
a
very
termagant
wife
to
a
very
turbulent
husband
so
that
notwithstanding
their
title
for
he
is
a
baronet
and
immense
riches
they
are
a
very
miserable
pair
they
were
lately
to
pay
lady
grimston
a
visit
but
there
happened
such
a
frecas
that
probably
it
may
be
the
last
she
will
ever
receive
from
them
the
husband
it
seems
though
very
rough
and
surly
in
his
nature
is
notwithstanding
a
man
and
not
void
of
humanity
which
had
induced
him
to
give
a
small
portion
to
a
young
girl
a
distant
relation
of
his
own
who
had
been
left
an
orphan
she
was
beloved
by
the
son
of
a
substantial
farmer
a
tenant
of
the
baronet
and
had
an
equal
affection
for
him
but
the
young
man
depending
entirely
on
his
father
for
his
future
prospects
durst
not
take
a
wife
without
something
to
begin
the
world
with
for
his
father
had
just
put
him
into
the
management
of
one
of
his
farms
the
young
lady
and
her
mother
who
was
a
widow
and
is
but
lately
dead
had
boarded
for
some
years
at
this
honest
farmer
house
and
in
that
time
a
mutual
love
had
been
contracted
between
the
young
people
the
old
man
himself
liked
the
girl
so
well
for
a
that
his
only
objection
was
her
want
of
fortune
but
this
was
such
an
obstacle
as
was
not
to
be
surmounted
by
a
man
who
being
accustomed
to
earn
money
by
indefatigable
industry
put
the
utmost
value
upon
it
his
regard
to
his
son
happiness
however
made
him
resolve
to
try
an
experiment
in
his
favour
and
accordingly
he
plucked
up
courage
and
went
to
his
landlord
he
told
him
in
his
own
blunt
way
that
he
came
to
speak
to
him
in
behalf
of
a
poor
young
gentlewoman
that
was
his
sir
william
relation
i
have
a
son
that
loves
her
said
he
and
she
loves
him
but
i
can
not
afford
to
let
the
boy
marry
a
wife
that
has
nothing
and
you
know
she
has
no
portion
i
would
not
desire
much
with
her
for
she
is
a
good
girl
and
very
housewifely
but
if
you
will
be
so
kind
to
give
her
something
to
set
them
a
going
a
little
i
shall
be
content
if
not
you
will
be
the
cause
of
my
son
losing
a
wife
for
he
swears
he
will
never
marry
any
other
woman
and
she
poor
thing
may
pine
away
for
love
i
do
not
desire
this
match
out
of
the
ambition
of
having
my
boy
related
to
you
but
because
i
think
the
girl
is
an
honest
girl
and
may
make
him
happy
the
rough
honesty
of
the
farmer
pleased
his
landlord
so
well
that
he
gave
the
young
woman
five
hundred
pounds
to
set
them
a
going
as
the
old
yeoman
termed
it
though
this
sum
was
but
a
trifle
to
a
man
of
his
fortune
and
the
giving
it
was
a
action
yet
did
it
exceedingly
displease
his
lady
especially
as
he
had
not
thought
proper
to
consult
her
on
the
occasion
she
was
not
contented
with
venting
her
indignation
on
her
husband
at
home
but
she
renewed
the
quarrel
by
complaining
to
lady
grimston
that
her
opinion
and
advice
were
not
only
despised
but
that
sir
william
was
lavishing
away
the
fortune
had
brought
him
upon
a
of
poor
relations
of
his
own
lady
grimston
immediately
took
fire
she
could
not
bear
the
thoughts
of
having
her
daughter
authority
of
less
weight
in
his
family
than
her
own
had
been
and
she
attacked
her
with
acrimony
on
the
subject
his
answer
to
her
was
short
look
ye
lady
grimston
you
made
a
very
obstreperous
wife
to
a
very
peacable
husband
your
daughter
i
find
is
mightily
disposed
to
follow
your
example
but
as
i
am
not
quite
so
tame
as
my
was
i
will
suffer
her
to
see
as
little
of
it
as
may
be
with
this
he
turned
from
her
and
ordering
his
coach
and
six
to
be
got
ready
immediately
with
very
little
ceremony
he
forced
his
wife
into
it
and
carried
her
home
directly
leaving
lady
grimston
foaming
with
rage
the
altercation
had
been
carried
on
with
so
little
caution
that
the
servants
heard
it
and
the
story
is
the
jest
of
the
neighbourhood
i
confess
i
am
not
sorry
for
this
breach
it
may
be
the
better
for
poor
mrs
vere
for
though
her
mother
jointure
reverts
to
a
male
relation
on
whom
the
estate
was
settled
yet
as
lady
grimston
has
a
large
personal
fortune
it
is
in
her
power
to
make
her
daughter
full
amends
for
the
injury
she
did
her
mr
arnold
is
improving
his
gardens
and
taking
in
a
great
deal
more
ground
to
enlarge
them
i
do
not
express
the
least
dissatisfaction
at
this
tho
i
own
i
could
wish
he
would
not
engage
in
new
expences
on
an
estate
which
is
now
in
litigation
but
our
lawyers
are
so
sanguin
that
they
encourage
him
to
proceed
following
is
writ
in
the
hand
of
the
lady
who
gave
the
editor
these
papers
follows
an
interval
of
four
months
in
which
time
though
the
journal
was
regularly
continued
nothing
material
to
her
story
occured
but
the
birth
of
a
daughter
after
which
she
proceeds
how
delightful
are
the
new
sensations
my
dear
cecilia
that
i
feel
hourly
springing
in
my
heart
surely
the
tenderness
of
a
mother
can
never
be
sufficiently
repaid
and
i
now
more
than
ever
rejoice
in
having
by
an
obedience
which
perhaps
i
once
thought
had
some
little
merit
in
it
contributed
so
much
to
the
repose
of
a
parent
to
whom
i
have
such
numberless
obligations
i
never
see
my
little
girl
but
i
think
such
were
the
tender
sentiments
the
sweet
anxieties
that
my
honoured
and
beloved
mother
felt
when
her
sidney
was
such
a
brat
as
this
then
i
say
surely
i
have
a
right
to
all
the
duty
all
the
filial
love
that
this
creature
can
shew
me
in
return
for
my
fondness
as
for
mr
arnold
he
idolizes
it
you
never
saw
so
good
a
nurse
as
he
makes
lady
grimston
declares
we
are
both
in
a
fair
way
of
ruining
the
child
and
advises
us
to
send
it
out
of
the
house
that
we
may
not
grow
too
fond
of
it
but
we
shall
hardly
take
her
counsel
i
informed
you
before
that
miss
burchell
had
been
summoned
home
by
her
uncle
who
was
then
very
she
has
lately
written
an
account
to
my
mother
of
his
death
and
that
as
she
has
now
her
fortune
in
her
own
hands
she
intends
immediately
to
quit
her
aunt
and
look
out
for
some
genteel
and
reputable
family
in
london
where
it
seems
she
chuses
to
reside
to
lodge
with
my
mother
in
her
letter
to
me
expresses
great
satisfaction
at
her
resolution
to
leave
her
aunt
but
is
not
without
her
fears
that
so
pretty
a
young
woman
left
to
her
own
guidance
may
be
liable
to
danger
though
she
thinks
both
her
natural
disposition
and
her
good
sense
sufficient
to
guard
her
against
actual
evil
our
lawyer
writes
us
a
word
that
he
has
had
an
offer
of
a
composition
proposed
by
the
widow
arnold
people
he
says
though
the
sum
they
mention
is
a
very
round
one
yet
it
plainly
indicates
the
weakness
of
their
hopes
and
concludes
with
telling
mr
arnold
that
if
would
buy
them
off
he
should
not
with
his
consent
give
it
to
them
as
it
would
tacitly
admit
the
legality
of
their
claim
and
might
be
productive
of
troublesome
consequences
hereafter
and
therefore
he
would
by
all
means
have
the
issue
fairly
tried
mr
arnold
laughs
heartily
at
the
proposal
but
says
he
is
very
much
obliged
to
the
lady
for
condescending
to
give
up
more
than
half
when
her
daughter
has
a
right
to
the
whole
without
whose
consent
he
supposes
it
is
not
in
the
mother
power
to
make
terms
i
wish
we
were
rid
of
this
troublesome
affair
as
it
must
hurry
us
to
town
sooner
than
we
intended
and
the
country
is
still
delightful
october
again
we
have
quitted
our
sweet
retirement
for
the
noise
and
bustle
of
london
but
this
it
seems
must
be
closely
pursued
though
our
antagonist
motions
seem
a
little
dilatory
we
can
not
find
out
the
secret
spring
that
sets
the
machine
the
wheels
however
do
not
seem
to
move
with
such
alacrity
as
they
did
though
the
widow
still
talks
big
and
says
we
shall
repent
of
having
rejected
her
offer
my
brother
is
arrived
in
town
but
took
care
to
settle
himself
in
handsome
commodious
lodgings
before
he
paid
us
a
visit
for
fear
i
suppose
that
we
should
again
press
him
to
accept
of
apartments
in
our
house
i
see
he
is
determined
to
keep
up
nothing
more
than
an
intercourse
barely
civil
mr
arnold
can
not
but
be
disgusted
with
his
behaviour
but
he
is
too
delicate
to
take
notice
of
it
to
me
i
am
disappointed
in
my
hopes
of
seeing
my
dear
mother
in
town
this
winter
her
apartment
was
ready
for
her
and
i
delighted
myself
with
the
thoughts
of
seeing
her
in
possession
of
it
at
least
for
a
few
months
but
she
writes
me
word
that
her
old
rheumatick
complaint
is
returned
on
her
with
such
violence
that
she
can
not
think
of
undertaking
the
journey
sadly
am
i
grieved
at
this
news
and
shall
long
to
have
the
winter
over
that
mr
arnold
and
i
may
fly
to
he
has
promised
me
this
satisfaction
early
in
the
summer
my
mother
informs
me
that
miss
burchell
constantly
corresponds
with
her
she
tells
her
that
her
aunt
is
come
to
town
to
sollicit
for
her
pension
but
that
she
never
sees
her
and
as
she
means
to
drop
all
correspondence
with
her
she
does
not
intend
even
to
let
her
know
where
she
lodges
i
commend
miss
burchell
highly
for
this
as
the
acquaintance
of
such
a
woman
may
be
hurtful
to
her
reputation
ensues
another
interval
of
nine
months
in
which
nothing
particular
is
related
but
that
mrs
arnold
became
mother
to
a
second
child
this
last
circumstance
with
a
few
others
preceding
and
succeeding
that
event
are
related
in
the
journal
by
her
maid
patty
after
which
mrs
arnold
herself
again
my
dear
cecilia
i
am
able
to
reassume
my
pen
i
have
read
what
patty
has
writ
and
find
she
is
admirable
at
the
anecdotes
of
a
nursery
am
i
not
rich
think
you
two
daughters
and
both
perfect
beauties
and
great
wits
you
may
be
sure
the
damsel
was
baptized
this
day
by
the
name
of
cecilia
i
am
angry
with
mr
arnold
he
takes
so
little
notice
of
this
young
stranger
his
affections
are
all
engaged
by
dolly
indeed
i
am
almost
jealous
of
her
for
he
spends
most
of
the
time
he
is
at
home
in
the
nursery
our
antagonist
is
grown
alert
again
and
has
renewed
her
efforts
which
we
thought
began
to
flag
a
little
with
fresh
vigour
whence
she
derives
those
revived
hopes
is
a
mystery
but
she
now
says
she
would
not
accept
of
a
composition
if
it
were
offered
my
poor
mr
arnold
begins
to
fret
a
little
it
now
and
then
makes
him
thoughtful
not
that
he
says
he
has
the
least
doubt
about
his
success
but
he
has
been
much
harrassed
with
the
necessary
attendance
that
the
cause
requires
and
downright
tired
with
dangling
after
lawyers
besides
they
say
the
cause
can
not
come
to
an
hearing
in
the
ensuing
term
though
they
before
made
us
hope
that
it
would
be
at
an
end
long
before
this
time
i
am
mortified
exceedingly
my
dear
cecilia
i
find
i
am
not
likely
to
see
my
mother
this
summer
i
thought
i
could
not
have
lived
so
long
from
her
sight
indeed
it
was
purely
in
the
hope
of
making
her
this
visit
that
i
prevented
her
coming
to
town
in
the
spring
which
she
purposed
doing
though
far
from
being
well
enough
to
undertake
the
journey
i
own
i
have
been
impatient
under
my
confinement
as
that
and
my
previous
circumstances
detained
us
so
long
in
town
and
i
this
day
asked
mr
arnold
when
we
should
set
out
for
he
answered
me
that
he
feared
it
would
not
be
in
his
power
this
season
to
pay
the
intended
visit
to
my
mother
he
says
he
has
not
been
near
his
estate
in
kent
these
five
years
except
for
a
day
or
two
at
a
time
and
that
he
thinks
it
necessary
to
see
what
condition
it
is
in
i
believe
i
have
told
you
that
there
is
a
pretty
house
on
it
the
place
is
called
and
is
that
which
my
mother
chose
for
my
settlement
mr
arnold
who
always
preferred
to
it
hardly
ever
visited
this
place
and
as
he
never
resided
there
and
only
lay
at
an
inn
when
he
went
down
the
house
is
unfurnished
excepting
a
room
or
two
which
a
man
who
receives
his
rent
has
just
made
habitable
for
his
own
convenience
but
that
i
have
laid
it
down
as
a
rule
never
to
oppose
so
good
so
indulgent
a
husband
as
mr
arnold
is
in
any
instance
wherein
i
do
not
think
a
superior
duty
requires
me
to
do
so
i
should
certainly
show
some
disapprobation
of
what
he
now
purposes
doing
it
will
be
attended
with
so
much
trouble
so
much
expence
too
he
has
ordered
the
house
at
to
be
completely
furnished
and
says
he
hopes
i
shall
like
it
so
well
as
to
be
induced
to
pass
the
remainder
of
the
summer
there
most
sure
it
is
every
place
will
be
delightful
to
me
where
i
can
enjoy
his
company
and
have
my
dear
little
babes
with
me
but
methinks
two
country
houses
are
an
unnecessary
charge
and
more
than
suits
our
fortune
i
pray
god
this
tender
husband
may
not
have
a
strong
and
prudent
reason
for
this
conduct
which
out
of
kindness
he
conceals
perhaps
he
thinks
this
little
spot
at
may
some
time
hence
be
the
whole
of
our
dependence
and
he
has
a
mind
to
be
with
ill
fortune
in
rendering
that
retreat
agreeable
to
me
and
rather
an
object
of
choice
than
of
necessity
if
this
be
his
motive
how
much
am
i
obliged
to
him
he
has
not
hinted
any
thing
like
it
nor
would
i
dash
the
pleasure
he
seems
to
promise
himself
there
by
insinuating
the
least
suspicion
of
what
his
reasons
are
for
going
to
it
if
we
lose
and
the
whole
estate
belonging
to
it
i
shall
only
regret
it
for
his
sake
we
are
to
set
out
my
cecilia
for
our
place
in
kent
i
have
made
the
best
apology
that
i
could
to
my
mother
and
mr
arnold
too
has
writ
to
her
but
i
know
she
will
be
extremely
disappointed
at
not
seeing
us
we
are
lately
arrived
at
mr
arnold
in
high
spirits
and
my
two
young
travellers
bore
the
fatigue
extremely
well
i
am
not
surprized
mr
arnold
liked
the
old
family
seat
better
than
this
i
can
not
say
i
am
much
charmed
with
it
but
i
will
not
let
him
see
that
i
affect
to
admire
and
seem
pleased
with
every
thing
that
affords
me
the
least
opportunity
of
commendation
the
house
is
a
very
neat
one
it
has
not
been
many
years
built
and
is
in
perfectly
good
repair
it
is
genteely
though
plainly
furnished
and
we
have
a
tolerable
garden
but
as
the
whole
domain
is
let
we
are
obliged
to
take
a
few
fields
from
one
of
our
tenants
to
supply
our
immediate
want
we
are
in
a
very
genteel
and
populous
neighbourhood
and
within
a
mile
of
a
good
market
town
i
have
regretted
nothing
so
much
in
my
absence
from
as
the
being
cut
off
from
the
hope
of
seeing
my
amiable
mrs
vere
we
can
have
but
to
share
our
heart
to
whom
we
have
no
reserve
and
whose
loss
is
irreparable
but
i
perceive
the
absence
of
a
pleasing
acquaintance
whose
society
is
no
farther
necessary
to
us
than
as
it
contributes
to
enliven
solitude
and
gets
a
preference
to
others
merely
by
comparison
is
a
loss
easily
supplied
this
i
find
by
experience
there
are
mrs
veres
every
where
but
alas
there
is
but
cecilia
i
was
visited
today
by
two
ladies
that
i
am
charmed
with
though
it
is
the
first
time
i
have
seen
either
of
them
the
one
is
lady
v
of
whom
you
have
formerly
heard
her
lord
and
she
came
together
their
seat
is
within
a
mile
of
us
and
mr
arnold
had
a
slight
acquaintance
with
lord
v
before
my
lady
is
about
forty
and
has
that
kind
of
countenance
that
at
once
invites
your
confidence
i
never
saw
integrity
benevolence
and
good
sense
more
strongly
pictured
in
a
face
her
address
is
so
plain
so
perfectly
free
from
affectation
or
any
of
the
little
supercilious
forms
of
ceremony
that
a
person
ignorant
of
what
true
politeness
consists
in
would
imagine
she
wanted
breeding
yet
she
received
her
education
in
a
court
but
she
seems
to
let
good
sense
and
good
nature
preside
over
all
her
words
and
actions
rather
than
form
she
told
me
she
had
deferred
her
visit
to
me
longer
perhaps
than
the
laws
of
decorum
would
admit
of
as
we
were
such
near
neighbours
but
said
she
i
was
determined
not
to
be
overlooked
in
the
crowd
of
visitors
that
have
been
thronging
to
you
every
day
since
you
came
down
the
character
i
have
heard
of
you
makes
me
wish
for
an
intimacy
with
you
and
you
are
not
to
look
upon
this
as
a
visit
of
ceremony
but
as
an
advance
towards
that
friendship
i
wish
to
cultivate
she
spoke
this
with
so
frank
an
air
that
flattering
as
the
compliment
appeared
i
could
not
help
believing
her
sincere
and
thought
myself
that
my
appearance
did
not
diminish
that
good
opinion
which
she
said
she
had
conceived
of
me
from
report
lord
v
is
many
years
older
than
his
lady
a
robust
man
as
plain
in
his
way
as
my
lady
is
in
her
though
way
and
are
very
different
for
he
is
frank
even
to
bluntness
but
the
best
humoured
man
living
the
other
lady
whom
i
mentioned
is
a
widow
her
name
is
gerrarde
and
she
lives
upon
a
little
estate
she
has
in
this
neighbourhood
i
think
i
never
beheld
so
fine
a
creature
she
is
about
six
and
twenty
her
stature
which
is
much
above
the
common
size
is
rendered
perfectly
graceful
and
majestic
by
one
of
the
finest
shapes
in
the
world
if
her
face
is
not
altogether
so
regularly
beautiful
as
her
person
it
is
however
handsome
enough
to
render
any
woman
charming
who
had
nothing
else
to
boast
of
whether
her
understanding
be
of
a
piece
with
the
rest
i
have
not
yet
been
able
to
discover
her
visit
to
me
was
but
short
for
she
had
not
sat
with
me
an
hour
when
lady
v
came
in
and
she
then
took
her
leave
but
by
what
i
could
observe
in
that
little
time
she
seems
to
have
as
much
vivacity
and
agreeable
humour
as
i
ever
met
with
in
any
one
she
pressed
me
to
dine
with
her
at
her
cottage
as
she
calls
it
and
i
like
her
too
well
to
refuse
the
invitation
these
two
charming
women
i
think
i
shall
single
out
for
my
chief
intimates
from
the
crowd
which
have
been
to
compliment
me
on
my
coming
into
this
country
mr
arnold
is
mightily
pleased
with
them
both
but
he
gives
the
preference
to
lady
v
whom
tho
he
had
a
slight
acquaintance
with
her
lord
he
never
saw
before
but
he
is
almost
as
great
a
stranger
in
this
place
as
i
am
he
is
highly
delighted
at
my
having
met
with
people
who
are
likely
to
render
it
agreeable
to
me
we
dined
according
to
appointment
with
mrs
gerrarde
a
cottage
she
called
her
house
nor
does
it
appear
much
better
at
the
outside
but
within
it
is
a
fairy
palace
never
was
any
thing
so
neat
so
elegant
so
perfectly
well
fansied
as
the
fitting
up
of
all
her
rooms
her
bedchambers
are
furnished
with
fine
chints
and
her
with
the
prettiest
indian
sattin
i
ever
saw
her
little
villa
is
called
ashby
and
her
husband
she
told
me
purchased
it
for
her
some
time
before
his
death
and
left
it
to
her
but
she
has
since
had
a
considerable
addition
to
her
fortune
by
the
death
of
a
relation
our
entertainment
was
splendid
almost
to
profusion
though
there
was
no
company
but
mr
arnold
and
i
told
her
if
she
always
gave
such
dinners
it
would
frighten
me
away
from
her
indeed
it
was
the
only
circumstance
in
her
whole
conduct
that
did
not
please
me
for
i
was
charmed
with
the
rest
of
her
behaviour
they
must
surely
be
of
a
very
churlish
disposition
who
are
not
pleased
where
a
manifest
desire
to
oblige
is
conspicuous
in
every
word
and
action
if
gerrarde
is
not
as
highly
polished
as
some
women
are
who
perhaps
have
had
a
more
enlarged
education
she
makes
full
amends
for
it
by
a
perfect
good
humour
a
sprightliness
always
entertaining
and
a
quickness
of
thought
that
gives
her
conversation
an
air
of
something
very
wit
and
which
i
dare
say
passes
for
the
thing
itself
with
most
people
i
have
returned
lady
v
visit
and
am
more
delighted
with
her
than
before
mr
arnold
went
with
me
but
my
lord
not
being
at
home
he
went
to
ramble
about
the
grounds
so
that
i
had
a
long
à
with
lady
v
she
is
an
admirable
woman
so
fine
an
understanding
such
delicacy
of
sentiment
and
such
an
unaffected
complaisance
in
her
manner
that
i
do
not
wonder
my
lord
perfectly
adores
her
there
is
a
tenderness
a
maternal
kindness
in
her
behaviour
towards
me
that
fills
me
at
once
with
love
and
reverence
for
her
and
next
to
my
cecilia
i
think
i
never
met
with
any
woman
whom
i
could
so
highly
esteem
as
lady
v
she
is
an
admirable
mistress
of
her
needle
and
every
room
in
her
house
exhibits
some
production
of
a
very
fine
genius
united
with
very
great
industry
for
there
are
beds
chairs
and
carpets
besides
some
very
pretty
rural
prospects
in
panels
executed
with
inimitable
skill
and
very
excellent
taste
she
tells
me
if
i
will
give
her
leave
to
bring
her
work
with
her
she
will
live
whole
days
with
me
i
am
rejoiced
now
that
mr
arnold
thought
of
coming
to
how
valuable
is
the
acquaintance
of
such
a
woman
as
lady
v
and
i
might
never
have
known
her
but
for
a
circumstance
to
which
i
was
at
first
so
averse
and
then
my
agreeable
lively
mrs
gerrarde
my
acquaintance
at
begin
to
fade
upon
my
memory
to
say
the
truth
i
think
of
none
of
them
with
pleasure
but
mrs
vere
and
my
good
humoured
old
dean
mrs
gerrarde
is
a
little
saucy
monopolist
she
grumbles
if
i
do
not
see
her
every
day
and
is
downright
jealous
of
my
intimacy
with
lady
v
they
are
acquainted
but
i
do
find
there
is
a
very
close
intercourse
between
them
mrs
gerrarde
says
her
ladyship
is
too
good
a
houswife
for
her
and
as
she
is
not
very
fond
of
herself
she
can
not
endure
people
that
are
always
poring
over
a
frame
i
find
indeed
that
this
sprightly
rogue
is
fonder
of
cards
than
of
work
she
draws
mr
arnold
and
me
in
very
often
for
a
pool
at
piquet
at
her
house
i
am
obliged
to
submit
but
at
my
own
i
often
take
up
a
book
when
she
and
mr
arnold
are
engaged
at
their
game
and
make
them
decide
the
contest
between
them
nay
i
threaten
that
i
will
some
night
or
other
steal
and
leave
them
for
she
is
unconscionable
at
late
hours
and
as
she
lives
very
near
us
and
keeps
a
chariot
she
does
not
scruple
to
go
home
at
any
hour
of
the
night
what
a
pity
it
is
so
amiable
a
woman
should
be
thus
fondly
attached
to
so
unprofitable
an
amusement
for
i
begin
to
see
play
is
her
foible
though
to
do
her
justice
she
never
engages
but
for
very
trifling
sums
and
that
only
in
our
own
little
domestic
way
but
this
passion
may
grow
upon
her
and
she
may
be
led
unawares
into
the
losing
more
than
her
fortune
can
bear
i
never
was
so
disconcerted
as
i
have
been
this
day
you
will
be
surprized
when
i
tell
you
it
was
by
my
good
lady
v
she
came
to
pass
the
day
with
me
mr
arnold
being
engaged
abroad
we
were
both
sitting
at
work
in
the
parlour
lady
v
had
continued
silent
for
a
good
while
at
last
looking
at
me
with
a
most
benign
smile
for
i
had
at
the
same
instant
cast
my
eyes
at
her
i
was
just
then
thinking
my
dear
mrs
arnold
said
she
that
i
once
though
perhaps
you
did
not
know
it
flattered
myself
with
the
hopes
of
being
related
to
you
her
words
threw
me
into
confusion
though
i
did
not
know
their
meaning
it
would
have
been
both
an
honour
and
a
happiness
to
me
madam
i
replied
though
i
do
know
by
what
means
i
was
ever
likely
to
possess
it
she
continued
smiling
but
seemed
in
suspence
whether
she
should
proceed
you
will
pardon
my
curiosity
my
dear
said
she
but
give
me
leave
to
ask
whether
mr
arnold
was
not
once
near
losing
the
happiness
he
now
enjoys
i
felt
my
face
glow
as
she
spoke
there
was
once
a
treaty
of
marriage
on
foot
madam
i
answered
between
me
and
another
gentleman
i
am
sorry
i
mentioned
it
said
my
lady
observing
my
confusion
but
as
i
was
no
stranger
to
the
affair
while
it
was
transacting
and
mr
faulkland
is
a
kinsman
of
mine
i
hope
you
will
forgive
my
inquisitiveness
for
i
own
i
have
a
curiosity
which
i
believe
no
body
but
yourself
can
gratify
and
if
i
did
not
think
you
the
most
candid
as
well
as
the
best
tempered
creature
living
i
durst
not
push
my
enquiry
my
lord
you
are
to
know
was
in
london
at
the
time
mr
faulkland
was
first
introduced
to
you
and
as
they
are
extremely
fond
of
each
other
mr
faulkland
did
not
scruple
to
disclose
his
passion
to
him
nor
the
success
it
then
appeared
likely
to
be
crowned
with
giving
him
at
the
same
time
such
a
character
of
you
as
i
have
since
found
you
deserve
when
my
lord
returned
to
v
hall
which
he
was
obliged
to
do
very
soon
after
mr
faulkland
had
made
this
discovery
to
him
he
informed
me
of
the
alliance
my
cousin
faulkland
was
going
to
make
and
we
were
pleasing
ourselves
with
the
thoughts
of
congratulating
him
on
his
happiness
when
we
received
a
letter
from
him
that
put
an
end
to
all
our
expectations
this
letter
contained
but
four
distracted
lines
he
told
my
lord
in
broken
sentences
that
he
had
lost
all
hopes
of
miss
bidulph
that
an
act
of
indiscretion
had
been
construed
into
a
capital
crime
and
that
being
banished
from
the
presence
of
the
woman
he
adored
he
was
immediately
about
to
bid
adieu
to
england
perhaps
for
ever
this
was
the
substance
of
what
he
wrote
to
us
we
have
heard
from
him
since
a
few
times
but
he
never
cleared
up
the
matter
to
us
nor
even
so
much
as
mentioned
it
i
have
not
been
in
london
since
my
lord
has
but
he
never
could
get
any
light
into
the
mystery
he
heard
from
some
of
our
friends
who
knew
of
the
intended
match
that
it
was
broke
off
nobody
knew
why
there
were
however
several
idle
surmises
thrown
out
some
laid
the
blame
on
mr
faulkland
and
some
on
you
but
the
truth
i
believe
still
remains
a
secret
now
my
dear
if
my
curiosity
is
improper
or
if
there
was
any
particular
motive
to
this
disappointment
of
my
hopes
which
you
do
chuse
to
reveal
forgive
my
enquiry
and
think
no
more
of
it
but
take
up
that
book
and
read
to
me
while
i
work
though
my
lady
gave
me
this
kind
opportunity
of
evading
her
question
i
did
not
lay
hold
of
it
i
did
not
indeed
chuse
to
reveal
the
whole
of
this
affair
because
i
did
not
think
myself
at
liberty
to
divulge
miss
burchell
secret
however
i
might
discover
my
own
i
told
my
lady
in
general
terms
that
though
mr
faulkland
might
pretend
to
a
lady
every
way
my
superior
yet
there
was
an
objection
to
him
of
no
small
weight
with
us
that
my
mother
had
been
informed
of
a
very
recent
piece
of
gallantry
he
had
had
with
a
person
of
some
condition
and
that
it
had
disgusted
her
so
much
she
could
not
think
of
uniting
me
with
a
man
whose
passions
were
not
a
little
more
staid
and
that
this
was
the
sole
reason
of
her
dislike
to
a
gentleman
who
was
in
every
other
respect
unexceptionable
i
am
glad
it
was
no
worse
said
lady
v
smiling
i
am
sure
mr
faulkland
is
not
capable
of
a
action
youthful
follies
he
may
have
had
though
i
believe
as
few
even
of
those
to
answer
for
as
most
men
of
his
years
i
make
not
the
least
doubt
however
that
lady
bidulph
was
guided
by
prudence
in
what
she
did
she
certainly
could
not
be
too
cautious
in
the
disposal
of
a
child
as
you
and
whatever
mr
faulkland
disappointment
may
be
i
hope
are
happy
lady
v
looked
at
me
as
she
pronounced
these
words
with
an
inquisitive
though
tender
regard
i
was
glad
of
an
opportunity
of
enlarging
on
the
merits
of
mr
arnold
and
told
her
i
was
as
happy
as
my
heart
could
wish
or
the
worthiest
of
men
could
make
me
i
am
glad
of
it
said
she
with
a
quickness
in
her
voice
but
do
imagine
my
dear
mrs
arnold
and
she
took
me
by
the
hand
that
i
introduced
this
conversation
merely
to
gratify
a
curiosity
which
i
fear
you
must
condemn
in
your
private
thoughts
though
you
have
been
so
good
as
to
satisfy
it
i
had
another
reason
a
much
stronger
one
what
is
it
dear
madam
almost
starting
with
apprehensions
of
i
did
not
know
what
be
alarmed
said
she
smiling
it
is
only
this
a
great
aunt
of
mr
faulkland
is
lately
dead
who
has
left
him
a
considerable
personal
estate
and
he
is
coming
over
to
take
possession
of
it
otherwise
i
do
know
when
we
should
have
seen
him
in
england
my
lord
had
a
letter
very
lately
from
him
he
was
then
at
turin
where
he
had
met
with
our
eldest
son
who
is
now
on
his
travels
he
told
us
he
had
letters
and
some
tokens
of
love
to
deliver
us
from
him
and
that
he
should
immediately
on
his
arrival
in
england
come
to
v
hall
where
he
would
pass
a
month
with
us
now
as
we
expect
him
daily
i
had
a
mind
to
apprize
you
of
his
intended
visit
that
you
might
not
be
surprized
by
perhaps
unexpectedly
meeting
him
at
my
house
i
thanked
her
ladyship
for
her
obliging
caution
though
i
thought
it
had
something
in
it
that
mortified
me
i
told
her
that
though
i
should
not
seek
to
renew
my
acquaintance
with
mr
faulkland
yet
had
i
no
reason
to
avoid
him
lady
v
who
is
extremely
quick
of
apprehension
replied
without
doubt
madam
you
have
not
but
you
might
be
surprized
at
seeing
him
notwithstanding
she
presently
turned
the
discourse
but
made
me
happy
the
whole
day
by
that
inexhaustible
fund
of
good
sense
and
improving
knowlege
of
which
she
is
mistress
mr
arnold
came
not
home
very
late
he
complains
that
he
is
got
into
a
knot
of
acquaintance
that
like
the
bottle
too
well
but
i
am
sure
his
natural
sobriety
is
such
that
it
will
not
be
in
the
power
of
example
to
lead
him
into
intemperance
though
i
am
vexed
he
has
fallen
into
such
acquaintance
because
i
know
drinking
is
disagreeable
to
him
yet
a
country
gentleman
must
sometimes
give
a
little
into
it
to
avoid
the
character
of
being
singular
surprized
i
was
not
because
i
came
prepared
but
i
own
i
was
abashed
at
seeing
mr
faulkland
mr
arnold
and
i
were
invited
to
dine
at
lord
v
and
his
lordship
and
his
guest
came
in
from
the
fields
where
they
had
been
walking
just
as
we
were
ready
to
sit
down
to
table
there
happened
to
be
a
good
deal
more
company
mr
faulkland
was
not
introduced
so
that
there
was
no
room
for
any
thing
constrained
or
improper
of
either
side
i
presently
recovered
the
little
embarrassment
that
his
first
entrance
into
the
room
occasioned
i
am
sure
nobody
took
notice
of
it
for
dinner
being
immediately
served
there
was
a
sort
of
bustle
in
hurrying
out
of
the
the
crowd
we
had
at
table
destroyed
all
conversation
and
nothing
particular
was
said
during
dinner
lady
v
soon
withdrew
and
all
her
female
friends
followed
her
i
observed
she
frequently
glanced
her
penetrating
eyes
at
mr
faulkland
while
we
were
at
table
but
i
did
not
chuse
to
make
any
observations
on
him
we
had
not
been
long
seated
at
our
coffee
when
four
of
the
gentlemen
slipped
from
their
company
and
came
to
us
these
were
mr
arnold
mr
faulkland
and
two
others
my
lord
is
pretty
free
at
his
bottle
and
none
of
these
gentlemen
i
suppose
were
fond
of
that
entertainment
lady
v
and
i
were
sitting
on
a
couch
i
called
to
mr
arnold
and
placed
him
between
us
mr
faulkland
approached
me
and
then
for
the
first
time
with
a
respectful
distance
enquired
after
my
mother
and
sir
george
telling
me
he
had
missed
of
the
latter
when
he
was
in
london
being
told
he
was
at
after
a
few
more
indifferent
questions
he
took
a
dish
of
coffee
and
retired
with
it
to
a
window
mr
arnold
asked
me
in
a
whisper
if
i
was
acquainted
with
mr
faulkland
i
could
only
answer
that
i
was
formerly
very
well
acquainted
with
him
nothing
more
passed
between
mr
faulkland
and
me
the
whole
evening
he
returned
soon
to
the
company
in
the
next
room
and
i
saw
no
more
of
him
i
can
with
the
utmost
sincerity
assure
my
cecilia
that
i
now
behold
mr
faulkland
with
as
much
indifference
as
i
do
any
other
man
of
my
acquaintance
time
joined
to
my
own
efforts
must
without
any
other
help
have
intirely
subdued
an
inclination
which
was
always
restrained
by
prudential
motives
and
rendered
subservient
to
my
duty
but
i
have
besides
this
now
acquired
a
shield
that
must
render
me
invulnerable
i
mean
the
perfect
and
tender
affection
i
bear
my
husband
this
has
completely
secured
me
against
the
most
distant
apprehensions
of
being
alarmed
from
any
other
quarter
yet
notwithstanding
all
this
i
say
that
i
am
quite
satisfied
at
this
renewal
of
my
acquaintance
with
mr
faulkland
i
hope
and
indeed
it
is
reasonable
to
suppose
that
i
have
now
as
little
interest
in
heart
as
he
has
in
mine
it
is
but
natural
to
believe
that
a
gay
young
man
like
him
should
not
be
so
weak
as
to
nourish
a
hopeless
passion
for
more
than
two
years
especially
as
he
has
never
once
seen
the
object
of
it
in
all
that
time
and
must
without
doubt
have
had
his
attention
engaged
to
others
in
all
likelihood
much
preferable
to
her
so
that
i
think
i
have
reason
to
be
as
easy
on
his
account
as
on
my
own
but
still
i
am
disquieted
in
my
mind
i
have
a
delicacy
that
takes
alarm
at
the
veriest
trifles
and
has
been
a
source
of
pain
to
me
my
whole
lifetime
it
makes
me
unhappy
to
think
that
i
am
now
under
an
almost
unavoidable
necessity
of
sometimes
seeing
and
conversing
with
a
man
who
once
had
such
convincing
proofs
that
he
was
not
indifferent
to
me
mr
arnold
ignorance
of
our
former
connections
makes
it
still
worse
at
the
time
i
was
so
averse
to
his
knowing
any
thing
of
this
affair
i
flattered
myself
i
should
never
see
mr
faulkland
more
or
at
least
never
be
obliged
to
have
any
intercourse
with
him
but
i
now
lament
that
i
did
not
take
my
mother
advice
and
disclose
the
whole
affair
at
first
oh
my
cecilia
when
the
smallest
deviations
from
candor
which
we
suppose
discretion
are
thus
punished
with
remorse
what
must
they
feel
whose
whole
life
is
one
continued
act
of
dissimulation
if
mr
arnold
had
been
acquainted
with
my
former
engagements
my
heart
would
be
more
at
ease
and
i
should
then
converse
with
this
man
with
all
the
disengaged
freedom
of
a
common
friend
i
wish
mr
arnold
curiosity
would
excite
him
to
ask
me
some
questions
relative
to
my
acquaintance
with
mr
faulkland
that
i
might
have
an
opportunity
of
telling
him
the
secret
but
the
enquiry
he
made
at
lady
v
was
in
a
careless
manner
he
was
satisfied
with
my
reply
and
spoke
not
of
him
since
you
will
laugh
perhaps
when
i
tell
you
that
i
have
not
courage
to
mention
it
first
mr
faulkland
is
reckoned
a
very
fine
gentleman
and
i
think
it
would
have
such
an
air
of
vanity
to
tell
my
husband
that
i
refused
him
then
it
would
bring
on
such
a
train
of
explanations
and
poor
miss
burchell
history
must
come
out
for
a
husband
on
such
a
subject
might
be
disgusted
with
concealments
of
any
kind
and
i
doubt
whether
even
some
circumstances
in
my
particular
share
of
this
story
might
not
displease
him
in
short
i
am
bewildered
and
know
not
what
to
wish
for
but
must
let
things
take
their
course
and
rest
satisfied
in
the
integrity
of
my
own
heart
oh
my
dear
i
am
mortified
to
the
last
degree
lest
mr
arnold
should
from
some
indiscreet
tongue
have
received
a
hint
of
my
former
engagement
he
may
think
me
disingenuous
for
never
having
mentioned
it
especially
since
mr
faulkland
has
been
in
the
neighbourhood
i
think
his
nature
is
too
open
to
entertain
any
suspicions
essentially
injurious
to
me
yet
may
this
affair
circumstanced
as
it
is
make
an
unfavourable
impression
on
him
i
wish
i
had
been
with
any
officious
whisperer
he
has
got
so
many
new
acquaintance
and
is
so
much
abroad
that
the
story
may
have
reached
his
ears
god
forbid
it
should
affect
his
mind
with
causeless
uneasiness
i
would
mr
faulkland
were
a
thousand
miles
from
v
hall
i
think
mr
arnold
is
altered
since
his
arrival
there
colder
he
appears
to
be
i
hope
i
but
it
yet
there
a
change
his
looks
are
less
kind
his
voice
has
lost
that
tenderness
that
it
used
to
have
in
speaking
to
me
yet
this
may
only
be
his
temper
a
man
can
not
be
a
lover
oh
i
sicken
at
the
very
thought
of
mr
arnold
entertaining
a
doubt
of
my
true
affection
for
him
i
would
not
live
in
this
suspence
for
millions
i
would
rather
he
should
treat
me
roughly
if
i
discovered
that
to
be
his
humour
though
it
would
frighten
me
yet
should
i
patiently
conform
to
it
that
which
was
ever
the
terror
of
my
thoughts
is
come
upon
me
mr
arnold
ah
my
dear
cecilia
mr
arnold
is
no
longer
the
same
coldness
and
indifference
have
at
length
succeeded
to
love
to
complacency
and
the
fondest
attention
what
a
change
but
the
my
dear
that
remains
a
secret
locked
up
in
his
own
breast
it
can
not
be
that
a
whisper
an
idle
rumour
should
affect
him
thus
what
if
he
heard
that
mr
faulkland
loved
me
once
that
we
were
to
have
been
married
can
not
he
ask
me
the
question
i
long
to
set
his
heart
at
ease
yet
can
not
mention
the
affair
first
after
so
long
a
silence
it
would
look
like
a
consciousness
a
consciousness
of
what
i
have
nothing
to
accuse
myself
of
i
am
no
longer
in
the
cause
the
fatal
cause
of
mr
change
is
discovered
this
miserable
day
has
disclosed
the
secret
to
me
a
black
a
complicated
scene
of
mischief
mr
arnold
rode
out
this
morning
he
told
me
he
was
to
dine
with
a
gentleman
at
some
miles
distance
and
should
not
return
till
late
in
the
evening
he
was
but
just
gone
when
a
lady
of
my
acquaintance
called
in
upon
me
to
request
i
would
go
with
her
to
a
play
that
was
to
be
performed
at
night
you
must
know
we
have
had
a
company
of
players
in
the
neighbourhood
for
some
time
past
and
it
was
to
one
of
those
poor
people
benefits
that
she
desired
my
company
i
promised
to
attend
her
though
you
know
i
do
much
admire
those
sort
of
entertainments
in
the
country
and
seldom
go
to
them
the
lady
and
her
husband
called
upon
me
at
the
appointed
hour
and
i
went
with
them
in
their
coach
the
place
which
the
players
had
fitted
up
for
their
purpose
had
formerly
been
a
pretty
large
schoolroom
and
could
with
the
addition
of
a
gallery
which
they
had
made
with
ease
contain
above
three
hundred
people
the
play
had
been
bespoke
by
some
of
the
principal
ladies
in
the
neighbourhood
who
had
used
all
their
interest
for
the
performer
so
that
the
house
was
as
full
as
it
could
hold
the
audience
consisting
chiefly
of
fashionable
people
it
was
with
difficulty
that
we
reached
the
places
which
were
kept
for
us
in
the
pit
as
they
happened
to
be
on
the
bench
next
the
stage
and
the
door
was
at
the
other
end
of
the
house
the
first
object
that
i
observed
on
my
coming
in
was
mr
faulkland
he
bowed
to
me
at
a
distance
but
made
no
attempts
to
approach
me
the
play
was
come
to
the
latter
end
of
the
fourth
act
and
the
curtain
was
let
down
to
make
some
preparation
on
the
stage
when
we
were
alarmed
with
the
cry
of
fire
it
happened
that
the
carpenters
who
had
been
employed
in
fitting
up
this
extempore
theatre
had
left
a
heap
of
shavings
in
a
little
place
behind
the
stage
which
had
been
converted
into
a
a
little
boy
belonging
to
the
company
had
found
a
candle
in
it
and
having
piled
up
the
shavings
set
them
on
fire
and
left
them
burning
the
flame
communicated
itself
to
some
dry
boards
which
lay
in
the
room
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
whole
was
in
a
blaze
some
persons
who
heard
the
crackling
of
the
wood
opened
the
door
when
the
flame
burst
out
with
such
violence
that
the
scenes
were
presently
on
fire
and
the
curtain
which
as
i
told
you
was
dropt
soon
caught
it
the
consternation
and
terror
of
the
poor
people
whose
was
destroying
is
not
to
be
described
the
women
shrieking
threw
themselves
off
the
stage
into
the
pit
as
the
smoke
and
flames
terrified
them
from
attempting
to
get
out
any
other
way
though
there
was
a
door
behind
the
stage
the
audience
were
in
little
less
confusion
than
they
for
as
the
house
was
composed
chiefly
of
wood
every
one
expected
it
would
soon
be
consumed
to
ashes
the
horror
and
distraction
of
my
mind
almost
deprived
me
of
the
power
of
motion
my
life
was
in
imminent
danger
for
i
was
scorched
with
the
fire
before
i
could
get
at
any
distance
from
the
stage
though
the
people
were
rushing
out
as
fast
as
they
could
the
lady
who
was
with
me
was
exceedingly
frightned
but
being
under
her
husband
care
had
a
little
more
courage
than
i
had
he
caught
her
round
the
waist
and
lifted
her
over
the
benches
which
were
very
high
giving
me
what
assistance
he
could
with
his
other
hand
but
the
terror
and
hurry
i
was
in
occasioned
my
foot
to
slip
and
i
fell
between
two
of
the
benches
and
sprained
my
ancle
some
people
pushing
to
get
out
rushed
between
me
and
my
company
the
excessive
pain
i
felt
joined
to
my
fright
made
me
faint
away
in
this
condition
mr
faulkland
found
me
and
carried
me
out
in
his
arms
for
my
companion
was
too
anxious
for
her
own
safety
to
suffer
her
husband
to
stay
to
give
me
any
assistance
so
that
he
had
only
time
to
beg
of
the
men
about
him
not
to
let
me
perish
i
soon
recovered
upon
being
carried
into
the
open
air
and
found
myself
seated
on
some
planks
at
a
little
distance
from
the
booth
mr
faulkland
supporting
me
and
two
or
three
other
people
about
me
whom
he
had
called
to
my
assistance
indebted
to
him
as
i
was
for
saving
my
life
my
spirits
were
at
that
time
too
much
agitated
to
thank
him
as
i
ought
he
told
me
he
had
stepped
behind
the
scenes
to
speak
to
somebody
and
was
there
when
the
stage
took
fire
that
he
then
ran
to
give
what
assistance
he
could
to
the
ladies
that
were
in
the
house
observe
he
distinguished
not
in
particular
and
had
just
come
in
when
he
saw
me
meet
with
the
accident
which
had
occasioned
my
fainting
away
and
when
the
gentleman
who
was
with
me
was
calling
for
help
but
at
the
same
time
getting
out
as
fast
as
he
could
i
now
began
to
recollect
myself
i
was
uneasy
at
mr
presence
i
wished
him
away
i
beseeched
him
to
return
once
more
to
the
booth
to
see
if
every
one
had
got
out
safe
for
i
told
him
i
had
seen
several
of
my
female
acquaintance
there
for
whom
i
was
alarmed
with
the
assistance
of
the
people
about
me
i
said
i
could
make
a
shift
to
get
to
the
nearest
house
which
was
not
above
a
hundred
yards
off
from
whence
i
should
send
home
for
my
chariot
which
i
had
ordered
to
come
to
me
after
the
play
he
begged
i
would
give
him
leave
to
see
me
safe
to
that
house
but
i
would
not
permit
him
and
he
left
me
in
the
care
of
two
women
and
a
man
who
had
come
to
be
spectators
of
the
fire
with
the
help
of
these
people
i
contrived
to
hobble
for
my
ancle
pained
me
exceedingly
to
the
place
i
mentioned
which
happened
to
be
a
public
house
all
the
rooms
below
were
full
and
the
woman
of
the
house
very
obligingly
helped
me
up
stairs
into
her
own
chamber
i
called
for
a
glass
of
water
which
was
immediately
brought
me
and
i
desired
the
woman
to
send
some
one
to
my
house
which
was
at
about
a
distance
to
order
my
chariot
to
come
to
me
immediately
while
the
woman
went
to
execute
my
instructions
i
had
thrown
myself
into
a
chair
that
stood
close
to
the
wainscot
i
heard
a
bell
ring
and
presently
a
waiter
entered
and
asked
if
i
wanted
any
thing
i
told
him
no
he
ran
hastily
out
of
the
room
and
entering
the
next
to
that
where
i
was
sitting
i
heard
a
voice
which
i
knew
to
be
mr
arnold
ask
were
the
servants
found
the
man
replying
that
they
were
not
then
said
mr
arnold
tell
your
mistress
she
will
oblige
me
if
she
will
let
me
have
her
chaise
to
carry
this
lady
home
the
waiter
presently
withdrew
and
without
reflecting
on
the
particularity
of
mr
arnold
being
there
with
a
lady
about
whom
i
formed
no
conjectures
i
was
about
to
rise
off
my
chair
to
go
in
to
him
but
being
almost
disabled
from
walking
i
was
obliged
to
creep
along
holding
by
the
wainscot
when
a
tender
exclamation
of
mr
arnold
stopped
me
my
dearest
creature
said
he
to
his
companion
you
have
not
yet
recovered
your
fright
a
female
voice
answered
him
with
some
fond
expressions
which
i
could
not
hear
distinctly
enough
to
discover
whose
it
was
but
i
was
soon
put
out
of
doubt
when
the
lady
added
in
a
louder
tone
do
you
know
that
your
wife
was
at
the
play
mr
arnold
answered
no
i
hope
she
did
not
see
me
mrs
gerrarde
for
i
perceived
it
was
she
who
spoke
replied
i
hope
not
because
perhaps
she
might
expect
you
home
after
the
play
though
mr
arnold
in
his
first
emotion
of
surprize
at
hearing
that
i
was
at
the
play
was
only
anxious
lest
i
should
have
observed
him
yet
he
was
not
so
lost
to
humanity
as
to
be
indifferent
whether
i
escaped
the
flames
or
not
i
am
surprized
i
did
not
see
her
said
he
i
wish
she
may
have
got
out
of
the
house
safe
you
are
very
sollicitous
about
her
replied
mrs
gerrarde
peevishly
there
was
one
there
perhaps
as
anxious
for
her
preservation
as
you
are
the
conversation
i
found
here
was
likely
to
become
extremely
critical
for
me
but
i
was
prevented
from
hearing
any
more
by
the
woman
of
the
house
who
just
then
entered
the
room
to
ask
me
how
i
did
and
to
know
if
i
wanted
any
thing
i
had
heard
enough
to
convince
me
that
my
presence
would
be
very
unacceptable
both
to
mr
arnold
and
his
companion
and
i
resolved
not
to
interrupt
them
nor
if
possible
ever
let
mr
arnold
know
that
i
had
made
a
discovery
so
fatal
to
my
own
peace
and
so
disadvantageous
to
him
and
his
friend
the
messenger
who
had
been
dispatched
for
my
chariot
met
it
by
the
way
and
was
now
returned
with
it
i
was
told
that
it
was
at
the
door
and
it
was
with
difficulty
i
got
down
stairs
leaning
on
the
woman
of
the
house
i
found
mr
faulkland
at
the
door
he
saw
that
i
wished
to
disengage
myself
from
him
after
he
had
carried
me
out
of
the
booth
and
though
probably
he
did
not
take
the
trouble
to
excuse
the
sham
commission
i
gave
him
which
was
indeed
with
no
other
view
than
to
get
him
away
yet
i
believe
he
had
too
much
respect
to
intrude
on
me
and
came
then
with
no
other
design
than
to
enquire
if
my
chariot
had
come
for
me
and
how
i
was
after
the
terrible
condition
he
had
left
me
in
sitting
at
night
in
the
open
air
with
nobody
but
two
or
three
ordinary
people
about
me
and
those
strangers
this
was
a
piece
of
civility
which
humanity
had
politeness
been
out
of
the
question
would
have
obliged
him
to
he
told
me
the
fire
was
extinguished
and
happily
nobody
had
received
any
hurt
and
that
he
had
only
called
at
that
house
to
know
if
i
were
safe
and
recovered
from
the
fright
and
pain
he
had
left
me
in
i
thanked
him
and
was
just
stepping
assisted
by
mr
faulkland
into
the
chariot
when
mr
arnold
appeared
at
the
door
he
was
alone
and
i
concluded
that
having
heard
the
chariot
rattle
up
the
he
supposed
it
was
the
carriage
he
had
ordered
for
mrs
gerrarde
and
came
down
to
see
if
it
was
ready
to
receive
her
the
light
which
the
servant
who
attended
me
out
held
in
his
hand
immediately
discovered
mr
arnold
and
me
to
each
other
i
could
easily
distinguish
surprize
mixed
with
displeasure
in
his
countenance
he
asked
me
abruptly
how
i
came
to
that
place
which
i
told
him
in
few
words
the
cold
civility
of
a
grave
bow
passed
between
him
and
mr
faulkland
who
leaving
me
in
my
husband
hands
wished
me
a
good
night
and
got
into
my
lord
v
coach
which
waited
for
him
though
i
knew
from
the
discourse
i
had
overheard
that
mr
arnold
did
not
mean
to
go
home
with
me
yet
as
i
was
now
seated
in
the
chariot
i
could
not
avoid
asking
him
he
told
me
he
was
engaged
to
sup
with
company
at
that
house
and
that
probably
he
should
not
be
at
home
till
late
i
knew
this
beforehand
and
without
troubling
him
with
any
farther
questions
drove
home
i
have
thrown
together
the
strange
occurrences
of
this
evening
as
well
as
the
tumult
of
my
spirits
would
give
me
leave
i
shall
now
lay
down
my
pen
to
consider
of
them
a
little
more
calmly
my
heart
sinks
in
me
oh
that
i
had
remained
in
ignorance
is
it
possible
my
cecilia
that
mr
arnold
so
good
a
man
one
who
married
me
for
love
and
who
for
these
two
years
has
been
the
tenderest
the
kindest
husband
and
to
whom
i
never
gave
the
most
distant
shadow
of
offence
should
at
last
be
led
into
i
can
not
name
it
dare
not
think
of
it
yet
a
thousand
circumstances
recur
to
my
memory
which
now
convince
me
i
am
unhappy
if
i
had
not
been
blind
i
might
have
seen
it
sooner
i
recollect
some
passages
which
satisfy
me
that
mr
arnold
acquaintance
with
mrs
gerrarde
did
not
commence
at
i
remember
lady
v
once
asked
me
had
she
and
i
been
acquainted
in
london
i
said
no
my
lord
laughed
and
in
his
blunt
way
said
i
will
swear
your
husband
was
for
i
have
seen
him
hand
her
out
from
the
play
more
than
once
i
never
asked
mr
arnold
about
this
it
made
no
impression
on
me
at
the
time
it
was
spoke
and
went
of
my
thoughts
is
one
i
hear
mr
arnold
ring
at
the
outer
gate
i
tremble
all
over
and
feel
as
if
i
feared
to
see
him
yet
why
should
i
fear
have
not
injured
mr
arnold
staid
long
enough
in
his
after
he
came
in
last
night
to
give
me
time
to
go
before
he
came
up
stairs
not
a
word
passed
between
us
i
slept
not
the
whole
night
whether
he
did
or
not
i
can
not
tell
he
asked
me
this
morning
when
he
rose
how
i
did
i
told
him
in
great
pain
my
ancle
was
prodigiously
swelled
and
turned
quite
black
for
i
had
neglected
it
last
night
he
said
you
had
better
let
a
surgeon
see
it
and
went
carelessly
out
of
the
room
how
new
is
unkindness
to
me
my
friend
you
know
i
have
not
been
used
to
it
mr
arnold
adds
cruelty
too
but
let
it
be
so
far
be
reproaches
or
complaints
from
my
lips
to
you
only
my
second
self
shall
i
utter
them
to
you
i
am
bound
by
solemn
promise
and
reciprocal
confidence
to
disclose
the
inmost
secrets
of
my
soul
and
with
you
they
are
as
safe
as
in
my
own
i
am
once
more
composed
and
determined
on
my
behaviour
i
have
not
a
doubt
remaining
of
mr
arnold
infidelity
but
let
me
not
aggravate
my
own
griefs
nor
to
a
vicious
world
justify
my
husband
conduct
by
bringing
any
reproach
on
my
own
the
silent
sufferings
of
the
injured
must
to
a
mind
not
ungenerous
be
a
sharper
rebuke
than
it
is
in
the
power
of
language
to
inflict
but
this
is
not
all
i
must
endeavour
if
possible
to
skreen
mr
arnold
from
censure
i
hope
his
own
imprudence
may
not
render
these
endeavours
ineffectual
i
am
resolved
not
to
drop
my
acquaintance
with
mrs
gerrarde
while
we
continue
upon
a
footing
of
seeming
intimacy
the
frequent
visits
which
i
am
sure
mr
arnold
makes
at
her
house
will
be
less
taken
notice
of
how
sir
george
would
triumph
at
the
knowlege
of
mr
arnold
deviating
from
virtue
how
my
poor
mother
would
be
amazed
and
afflicted
but
i
will
as
far
as
lies
in
my
power
disappoint
the
malice
of
my
stars
my
mother
shall
have
no
cause
to
grieve
nor
my
brother
to
rejoice
the
secret
shall
die
with
me
in
my
own
bosom
and
i
will
wait
patiently
till
the
hand
of
time
applies
a
remedy
to
my
mrs
gerrarde
sent
a
message
to
enquire
how
i
did
conscious
woman
she
would
not
come
herself
though
she
knew
not
i
had
discovered
her
my
dear
good
lady
v
hurried
to
see
me
the
instant
she
had
breakfasted
mr
faulkland
had
told
her
of
my
disaster
and
her
tenderness
soothed
and
comforted
me
much
she
sat
by
my
two
hours
and
her
discourse
alleviated
the
pain
both
of
my
mind
and
body
but
now
she
has
left
me
i
must
again
recur
to
the
subject
that
wrings
my
heart
mr
arnold
is
enslaved
to
one
of
the
most
artful
of
her
sex
i
look
upon
his
attachment
to
be
the
more
dangerous
as
i
believe
it
is
the
first
of
the
kind
he
ever
had
and
no
woman
was
ever
more
formed
to
please
and
to
deceive
than
she
who
now
holds
him
in
her
chains
into
what
hands
am
i
fallen
mrs
gerrarde
must
have
heard
my
story
and
by
the
hint
i
heard
her
drop
what
cruel
misrepresentations
may
she
have
made
to
mr
arnold
mr
faulkland
she
can
have
no
enmity
to
but
me
she
certainly
hates
for
she
has
injured
me
is
noon
i
have
not
seen
mr
arnold
since
morning
he
has
been
abroad
ever
since
he
rose
good
god
is
this
the
life
i
am
condemned
to
lead
a
new
scene
of
affliction
is
opened
to
me
surely
my
fate
is
drawing
towards
a
crisis
mr
arnold
has
just
left
me
what
conversation
have
we
had
after
entering
my
room
he
walked
about
for
some
minutes
without
speaking
at
last
stopping
short
and
fixing
his
eyes
upon
me
how
long
have
you
said
he
been
acquainted
with
mr
faulkland
i
told
him
my
acquaintance
began
with
him
some
months
before
i
was
married
he
was
once
your
lover
i
am
informed
he
was
and
a
treaty
of
marriage
was
concluded
on
between
us
you
would
have
been
happier
perhaps
madam
if
it
had
taken
place
i
do
not
think
so
mr
arnold
you
have
no
reason
to
suppose
i
do
i
had
a
very
great
objection
to
mr
faulkland
and
obeyed
my
mother
willingly
when
she
forbid
me
to
see
him
i
ask
not
what
that
objection
was
said
he
but
i
suppose
madam
you
will
without
reluctance
obey
if
i
make
the
same
request
to
you
most
chearfully
you
can
not
make
a
request
with
which
i
should
more
readily
comply
but
let
me
beseech
you
mr
arnold
to
tell
me
what
part
of
my
behaviour
has
given
you
cause
to
think
such
a
prohibition
necessary
i
do
not
say
answered
mr
arnold
that
i
have
any
suspicion
of
your
virtue
but
your
acquiescence
in
this
particular
is
necessary
to
peace
and
your
honour
a
lady
being
does
not
cut
off
the
hopes
of
a
gay
man
you
give
me
your
promise
that
you
will
not
see
him
any
more
i
said
i
i
will
give
up
lady
v
whose
acquaintance
i
so
much
esteem
i
will
go
no
more
to
her
house
while
mr
faulkland
continues
there
and
i
know
of
no
other
family
where
i
visit
that
he
is
acquainted
with
my
pride
would
not
suffer
me
to
enquire
where
he
had
got
his
information
i
already
knew
it
too
well
and
fearing
he
would
rather
descend
to
an
untruth
than
tell
me
his
author
i
declined
any
farther
questions
he
seemed
satisfied
with
my
promise
but
quickly
left
me
as
if
the
whole
end
of
his
visit
to
me
was
accomplished
in
having
obtained
it
what
painful
minutes
am
i
obliged
to
sustain
mrs
gerrarde
has
been
to
see
me
gay
and
assured
as
ever
she
affected
to
condole
with
me
on
the
accident
that
happened
to
my
foot
with
such
an
overstrained
concern
such
a
tender
solicitude
that
her
insincerity
disgusted
me
if
possible
more
than
the
other
part
of
her
behaviour
she
told
me
she
herself
had
been
at
the
play
but
very
luckily
had
got
out
without
receiving
any
injury
i
said
i
was
surprized
i
had
not
seen
her
there
o
replied
she
i
was
in
a
little
snug
corner
where
nobody
could
see
me
for
having
refused
to
go
with
some
ladies
that
asked
me
i
did
not
chuse
to
be
visible
in
the
house
and
so
squeezed
myself
up
into
what
they
called
their
gallery
for
i
took
nobody
with
me
but
my
maid
audacious
woman
is
it
not
strange
my
dear
that
mr
arnold
could
be
so
weak
as
to
humour
her
in
the
absurd
frolick
of
going
with
her
to
such
a
place
for
so
it
must
have
been
or
perhaps
she
appointed
him
only
to
call
for
her
at
the
play
and
he
might
have
arrived
but
just
in
time
to
assist
her
in
getting
out
no
matter
which
it
was
i
was
born
to
sacrifice
my
own
peace
to
that
of
other
people
my
life
is
become
miserable
but
i
have
no
remedy
for
it
but
patience
mr
arnold
spends
whole
days
abroad
at
night
we
are
separated
on
account
of
my
indisposition
so
that
we
hardly
ever
converse
together
what
a
dreadful
prospect
have
i
before
me
o
cecilia
may
you
never
experience
the
bitterness
of
having
your
husband
heart
alienated
from
you
lady
v
that
best
of
creatures
is
with
me
constantly
she
presses
me
to
come
to
her
house
as
my
ancle
is
now
pretty
well
yet
i
am
obliged
to
excuse
myself
i
am
distressed
to
the
last
degree
at
the
conduct
i
shall
be
forced
to
observe
towards
her
yet
dare
not
explain
the
motive
causeless
jealousy
is
always
the
subject
of
ridicule
and
at
all
events
mr
arnold
must
not
be
exposed
to
this
i
am
weary
of
inventing
excuses
for
absenting
myself
from
v
hall
my
lady
has
done
solliciting
me
yet
continues
her
friendly
and
affectionate
visits
i
fear
she
guesses
my
situation
though
she
has
not
as
yet
hinted
at
it
but
her
forbearing
to
press
me
any
more
on
the
subject
of
going
to
her
and
at
the
same
time
not
requiring
a
reason
for
this
breach
of
civility
as
well
as
friendship
convinced
me
that
she
suspects
the
cause
of
my
restraint
i
am
now
perfectly
recovered
yet
do
i
still
confine
myself
to
my
house
to
avoid
as
much
as
possible
giving
umbrage
to
lady
v
but
this
restraint
can
not
last
much
longer
mrs
gerrarde
teazes
me
to
come
to
her
and
i
have
promised
to
make
her
my
first
visit
said
i
not
that
my
fate
was
near
its
crisis
where
will
this
impending
ruin
end
take
my
cecilia
the
occurrences
of
this
frightful
day
mr
arnold
rode
out
this
morning
and
told
me
he
should
not
return
till
night
he
asked
me
with
that
indifference
which
now
accompanies
all
his
words
how
i
meant
to
dispose
of
myself
for
the
day
i
told
him
i
had
no
design
of
going
abroad
and
should
spend
my
time
in
reading
or
at
my
needle
this
was
my
real
intention
but
mr
arnold
had
but
just
left
the
house
when
i
received
a
message
from
mrs
gerrarde
to
know
how
i
did
and
to
tell
me
she
was
not
well
and
much
out
of
spirits
or
she
would
come
and
pass
the
day
with
me
but
that
she
insisted
on
my
dining
with
her
as
i
had
told
mr
arnold
i
did
not
mean
to
go
out
i
really
had
neither
intention
nor
inclination
to
do
so
but
shall
i
confess
my
weakness
to
you
i
suspected
that
he
purposed
spending
the
day
as
he
often
did
with
mrs
gerrarde
and
the
more
so
from
the
question
he
had
asked
me
on
his
going
abroad
he
thought
i
might
probably
pay
her
a
visit
and
this
intrusion
was
a
circumstance
he
had
a
mind
to
be
guarded
against
by
knowing
my
designs
i
had
not
been
to
see
mrs
gerrarde
since
my
recovery
and
it
was
natural
to
suppose
i
would
return
her
visits
possessed
as
i
was
with
this
opinion
her
message
gave
me
a
secret
satisfaction
as
it
served
to
convince
me
mr
arnold
was
not
to
be
with
her
for
she
generally
detained
me
late
when
i
went
to
her
house
from
what
trivial
circumstances
will
the
afflicted
draw
consolation
or
an
additional
weight
of
grief
so
it
was
i
felt
a
sort
of
pleasure
in
thinking
that
for
all
that
day
at
least
mr
arnold
would
absent
himself
from
my
rival
my
rival
mean
word
she
is
not
worthy
to
be
called
so
from
his
mistress
let
it
be
in
short
i
resolved
to
go
especially
as
she
had
sent
me
word
she
was
not
well
and
i
knew
my
husband
would
be
pleased
with
my
complaisance
i
went
accordingly
to
her
house
a
little
before
her
hour
of
dining
which
is
much
later
than
any
body
else
in
this
part
of
the
world
i
found
her
dressed
out
and
seemingly
in
perfect
health
she
looked
surprized
when
she
saw
me
and
i
then
supposed
that
she
hoped
to
have
received
a
denial
from
me
and
was
disappointed
at
my
coming
though
i
wondered
that
the
answer
she
received
to
her
message
had
not
prepared
her
this
thought
rushed
into
my
mind
in
an
instant
and
i
was
sure
she
expected
mr
arnold
i
told
her
if
i
had
thought
i
should
have
found
her
so
well
that
her
message
should
not
have
brought
me
to
her
for
that
i
had
determined
not
to
stir
out
that
day
till
her
invitation
prevailed
on
me
to
change
my
mind
sure
my
dear
said
she
there
must
have
been
some
mistake
in
delivering
the
message
to
you
it
was
for
i
desired
the
pleasure
of
your
company
to
dine
with
me
for
today
i
am
absolutely
engaged
however
i
am
very
glad
you
are
come
for
i
shall
not
go
out
till
seven
i
was
vexed
and
mortified
either
your
servant
or
mine
made
a
mistake
said
i
for
i
was
told
you
desired
to
see
me
besides
you
sent
me
word
you
were
not
well
she
seemed
a
little
abashed
at
this
i
very
ill
in
the
morning
she
said
and
though
i
was
engaged
to
spend
the
evening
abroad
did
intend
to
have
sent
an
excuse
but
finding
myself
better
i
changed
my
purpose
dinner
was
immediately
served
and
i
sat
down
but
with
a
reluctance
that
prevented
me
from
eating
i
would
have
taken
my
leave
soon
after
dinner
but
mrs
gerrarde
insisted
on
my
staying
and
told
me
if
i
refused
her
she
should
think
i
had
taken
something
amiss
of
her
she
called
for
cards
i
suffered
myself
to
be
persuaded
and
we
fell
to
piquet
i
played
with
disgust
and
without
attention
every
minute
wishing
to
break
away
coffee
was
at
length
brought
in
i
begged
to
be
excused
from
staying
telling
mrs
gerrarde
i
was
sure
i
prevented
her
from
going
abroad
but
she
would
take
no
denial
i
was
constrained
to
take
a
dish
of
coffee
and
was
hastening
to
get
it
down
when
the
parlour
door
flew
open
and
lo
mr
faulkland
entered
the
room
if
an
object
the
most
horrible
to
human
nature
had
appeared
before
me
it
could
not
at
that
instant
have
shocked
me
half
so
much
i
let
the
cup
and
saucer
drop
from
my
hand
to
say
i
turned
pale
trembled
and
was
ready
to
faint
would
be
too
feeble
a
description
of
the
effect
this
spectre
had
on
me
i
was
senseless
i
almost
died
away
mrs
gerrarde
pretended
to
be
greatly
alarmed
she
ran
for
drops
and
having
given
me
a
few
in
a
glass
of
water
i
made
a
shift
to
rise
off
my
chair
and
telling
her
i
should
be
glad
of
a
little
air
tottered
to
the
street
door
i
determined
to
go
home
directly
but
the
universal
tremor
i
was
now
in
disabled
me
from
walking
and
i
sat
down
in
the
porch
to
recover
myself
a
little
mr
faulkland
having
been
a
witness
to
the
agony
his
presence
had
thrown
me
into
did
not
a
little
aggravate
the
horror
and
confusion
of
my
thoughts
whatever
were
he
had
not
spoke
to
me
nor
was
it
possible
for
me
to
have
remarked
his
behaviour
i
staid
not
more
than
two
minutes
in
the
parlour
after
he
entered
in
this
situation
you
will
think
my
distress
would
hardly
admit
of
any
addition
but
the
final
blow
was
yet
to
come
mrs
gerrarde
had
staid
a
minute
in
the
parlour
to
speak
to
mr
faulkland
after
i
went
out
but
presently
followed
me
and
was
soothing
me
with
the
kindest
expressions
when
i
heard
the
trampling
of
horses
and
presently
beheld
mr
arnold
alighting
at
the
door
i
now
gave
myself
up
for
lost
my
mind
suddenly
suggested
to
me
that
mrs
gerrarde
had
contrived
a
plot
upon
my
innocence
but
how
she
had
been
able
to
bring
it
about
my
thoughts
were
not
then
disengaged
enough
to
conceive
my
mind
was
all
a
chaos
i
was
not
able
to
answer
mr
arnold
when
he
spoke
to
me
he
soon
perceived
my
disorder
and
enquired
the
cause
mrs
gerrarde
took
upon
her
to
answer
that
i
was
just
preparing
to
go
home
when
i
was
taken
suddenly
ill
i
was
going
abroad
said
she
and
as
i
ordered
the
chariot
much
about
this
hour
i
fancy
it
is
ready
and
may
as
well
carry
mrs
arnold
home
you
had
best
step
into
the
parlour
my
dear
to
me
till
it
is
brought
to
the
door
i
am
now
able
to
walk
madam
said
i
there
is
no
occasion
to
give
you
that
trouble
mr
arnold
said
i
should
not
walk
by
any
means
and
mrs
gerrarde
immediately
calling
to
a
servant
to
order
the
chariot
to
the
door
said
as
she
was
going
out
she
would
leave
me
at
home
herself
mr
arnold
answered
it
would
be
the
best
way
and
that
he
should
follow
soon
the
chariot
was
presently
at
the
door
and
i
was
preparing
to
get
into
it
when
mrs
gerrarde
cry
bless
me
i
had
forgot
it
will
not
be
so
civil
to
leave
the
gentleman
behind
without
saying
any
thing
to
him
mr
arnold
hastily
asked
what
gentleman
mrs
gerrarde
replied
mr
faulkland
took
it
into
his
to
make
me
a
visit
this
evening
she
went
quickly
into
the
parlour
and
strait
returned
with
mr
faulkland
who
bowing
carelessly
to
mr
arnold
and
civilly
to
me
walked
away
mrs
gerrarde
stepped
into
the
chariot
to
me
and
ordered
it
to
drive
to
my
house
leaving
mr
arnold
standing
motionless
at
her
door
a
total
silence
prevailed
on
my
side
during
our
short
journey
home
except
to
answer
in
monosyllables
mrs
gerrarde
repeated
enquiries
after
my
health
she
set
me
down
at
my
own
door
and
took
her
leave
without
alighting
when
i
found
myself
alone
i
began
to
consider
the
consequences
of
this
evening
fatal
interview
an
interview
which
though
unthought
of
by
me
i
judged
was
contrived
to
ensnare
me
i
laid
all
the
circumstances
together
and
endeavoured
to
unravel
the
clue
is
plain
to
me
mr
arnold
was
expected
by
mrs
gerrarde
this
evening
she
sent
for
me
on
purpose
to
betray
me
the
message
which
she
pretended
was
delivered
wrong
was
only
an
artifice
in
order
to
impose
on
mr
arnold
that
he
might
imagine
she
did
not
expect
me
indeed
he
could
not
possibly
think
she
should
send
for
me
on
the
very
evening
he
was
to
be
with
her
and
she
had
so
well
guarded
her
contrivance
that
it
was
not
easily
to
be
detected
she
had
sent
her
message
by
word
of
mouth
though
she
generally
wrote
them
down
on
paper
but
this
way
would
not
have
been
liable
to
misconstruction
she
had
told
me
she
was
engaged
in
the
evening
yet
detained
me
longer
than
i
meant
to
stay
from
the
first
of
these
circumstances
it
must
appear
to
mr
arnold
that
as
i
had
come
unwished
for
she
wanted
to
get
rid
of
me
the
latter
obviously
served
her
own
purpose
for
it
is
as
clear
as
daylight
that
she
laid
her
plan
so
as
that
mr
arnold
should
find
mr
faulkland
and
me
together
all
this
i
have
deduced
from
a
long
train
of
reasoning
on
the
circumstances
but
the
inexplicable
part
of
the
mystery
is
how
she
contrived
to
get
mr
faulkland
with
whom
i
did
not
think
she
was
acquainted
to
visit
her
at
so
fatally
critical
a
juncture
sure
some
evil
spirit
must
have
assisted
her
in
this
wicked
scheme
she
knew
no
doubt
of
the
promise
mr
arnold
had
exacted
of
me
never
to
see
him
the
apparent
breach
of
this
promise
she
may
have
art
enough
to
persuade
mr
arnold
was
concerted
on
my
side
but
i
hope
i
shall
be
able
to
clear
myself
of
this
cruel
imputation
to
my
husband
truth
must
force
its
way
into
his
mind
if
he
is
not
resolved
on
my
destruction
perhaps
mr
faulkland
may
be
secretly
mrs
gerrarde
admirer
and
mr
arnold
is
the
dupe
to
her
perfidy
as
i
am
the
sacrifice
to
her
malice
and
is
all
a
strange
riddle
but
i
can
not
remain
long
in
this
dismal
state
of
suspence
mr
arnold
perhaps
may
discover
her
treachery
while
she
is
endeavouring
to
destroy
me
in
his
good
opinion
i
am
waiting
here
like
a
poor
criminal
in
expectation
of
appearing
before
my
judge
i
wish
mr
arnold
were
come
in
yet
i
dread
to
see
him
i
might
have
spared
myself
the
anxiety
mr
arnold
is
just
returned
but
he
has
locked
himself
into
another
chamber
i
will
not
molest
him
tonight
perhaps
he
may
be
in
better
temper
and
i
may
be
able
to
justify
myself
to
him
and
dispel
this
frightful
gloom
that
hangs
over
us
hopes
and
fears
are
at
an
end
and
the
measure
of
my
afflictions
is
filled
up
i
went
to
bed
last
night
but
slept
not
the
hours
were
passed
in
agonies
not
to
be
described
i
think
all
griefs
are
magnified
by
silence
and
darkness
i
well
knew
prepossessed
as
mr
arnold
was
by
my
artful
enemy
i
should
find
it
difficult
to
excuse
myself
or
persuade
him
that
chance
or
mrs
gerrarde
more
wicked
contrivance
had
been
the
sole
cause
of
what
had
given
him
such
offence
i
was
resolved
however
to
vindicate
my
innocence
and
was
in
my
own
thoughts
preparing
my
defence
the
greatest
part
of
the
night
towards
morning
weariness
and
grief
overpowered
me
and
i
fell
asleep
but
i
enjoyed
not
this
repose
long
some
noise
that
was
made
in
the
house
suddenly
awakened
me
i
saw
it
was
broad
day
and
looking
at
my
watch
found
it
was
past
seven
i
rang
my
bell
and
patty
entering
my
room
i
enquired
if
her
master
was
yet
stirring
the
poor
girl
looked
aghast
he
is
gone
away
on
horseback
madam
said
she
almost
two
hours
ago
and
he
ordered
his
man
to
put
up
some
linnen
and
a
few
other
things
in
a
small
portmanteau
i
believe
he
means
not
to
return
for
he
bid
me
to
deliver
this
letter
to
you
i
opened
the
letter
with
trembling
hands
from
whence
i
received
my
doom
in
the
following
words
have
broken
your
faith
with
me
in
seeing
the
man
whom
i
forbad
you
to
see
and
whom
you
so
solemnly
promised
to
avoid
as
you
have
betrayed
my
confidence
in
this
particular
i
can
no
longer
rely
on
your
prudence
or
your
fidelity
whatever
your
designs
may
be
it
will
be
less
to
my
dishonour
if
you
prosecute
them
from
under
your
husband
roof
i
therefore
give
you
till
this
day
to
consider
of
a
place
for
your
future
abode
for
one
house
must
no
more
contain
two
people
whose
hearts
are
divided
our
children
remain
with
me
and
the
settlement
which
was
made
on
you
in
marriage
shall
be
appropriated
to
your
separate
use
have
left
home
to
avoid
expostulations
nor
shall
i
return
to
it
till
i
hear
you
have
removed
yourself
spare
the
attempt
of
a
justification
which
can
only
aggravate
the
resentment
of
your
already
injured
husband
i
have
for
a
while
suppressed
the
tumult
in
my
soul
to
give
you
this
shocking
letter
o
my
cecilia
what
a
wretched
lot
is
thy
unhappy
friend
to
be
neglected
forsaken
despised
by
a
husband
that
i
love
yet
i
could
bear
that
but
to
be
suspected
accused
too
to
be
at
once
the
miserable
object
of
jealousy
and
scorn
surely
they
know
nothing
of
the
human
heart
who
say
that
jealousy
can
not
subsist
without
affection
i
have
a
fatal
proof
to
the
contrary
mr
arnold
loves
me
not
yet
doubts
my
honour
cruel
mean
detestable
suspicion
oh
that
vile
woman
is
she
has
done
this
like
a
persecuting
dæmon
she
urges
on
the
ruin
which
she
set
on
foot
what
can
i
do
whither
can
i
fly
i
can
not
remain
here
any
longer
my
presence
banishes
mr
arnold
from
his
home
if
i
go
to
my
mother
under
such
circumstances
it
will
break
her
heart
yet
she
must
know
it
i
must
not
wait
to
be
turned
out
of
my
own
doors
that
thought
is
not
to
be
borne
i
will
go
this
instant
no
matter
whither
god
preserve
me
in
my
senses
i
have
passed
two
days
and
two
nights
i
know
not
how
in
silence
and
without
food
patty
tells
me
but
i
think
i
am
a
little
recovered
i
will
write
to
my
mother
and
beg
of
her
to
open
her
arms
to
receive
her
miserable
child
i
am
collected
enough
and
know
what
to
say
i
had
just
dispatched
my
letter
incoherent
as
it
is
and
blotted
with
my
tears
when
patty
brought
me
one
that
had
come
by
the
post
i
knew
my
dear
mother
hand
on
the
superscription
and
kissed
it
before
i
opened
it
see
my
sister
how
the
tenderest
of
parents
write
to
her
unhappy
child
whom
she
fondly
believes
to
be
the
darling
of
her
husband
and
blessed
with
domestic
felicity
my
beloved
sidney
i
find
age
and
infirmities
are
advancing
upon
me
my
last
illness
shook
me
severely
and
has
left
a
memorandum
of
what
i
may
expect
in
the
next
visit
it
makes
me
your
family
cares
are
now
so
much
enlarged
that
i
can
not
expect
nor
do
i
desire
that
you
should
undertake
a
journey
to
to
pay
me
a
short
visit
yet
my
dear
as
you
are
the
comfort
of
my
age
i
can
not
in
the
present
precarious
state
of
my
health
bear
to
be
at
such
a
distance
from
you
while
god
permits
me
strength
i
will
lay
hold
of
his
bounty
and
endeavour
to
get
to
london
you
have
told
me
that
you
are
not
conveniently
circumstanced
at
as
to
room

will
not
therefore
incommode
you
but
shall
content
myself
with
waiting
your
arrival
in
town
at
your
house
in
but
do
not
hasten
your
departure
from
the
country
on
this
account
i
am
in
no
immediate
danger
my
dear
only
willing
to
lay
hold
of
an
interval
of
health
to
get
nearer
to
you
if
god
prolongs
my
life
what
joy
will
it
be
to
me
to
spend
next
winter

my
darling
and
her
dear
good
arnold
and
to
feast
my
eyes
with
my
lovely
grandchildren
if
i
am
called
from
you
i
shall
have
the
comfort
of
my
affectionate
hands
to
close
my
eyes
and
shall
leave
the
world
without
regret
as
i
have
lived
to
see
my
sidney
happy
in
the
arms
of
a
good
man
who
will
supply
the
loss
of
parents
and
unite
in
himself
those
tender
ties
which
nature
must
soon
dissolve
my
prayers
for
yours
and
my
dear
son
prosperity
i
never
fail
to
offer
up
to
heaven
your
brother
george

with
me
and
desires
to
be
remembered
to
you

purposes
staying
here

greatest
part

the
winter

week

sincerely
affectionate
mother

heart
is
bursting
o
cecilia

of
my
fond

dear
venerable
parent
when
she
finds
this
daughter
this
comfort
of
her
age
this
beloved
of
her
soul
a
poor
abandoned
outcast
lost
to
her
husband
love
turned
out
of
his
doors
despised
disgraced
my
children

i
must
leave
them
behind
my
god
for
what
calamities
hast
thou
ordained
thy
creature
tears
tears
you
may
well
flow
so
i
am
relieved
and
will
endeavour
to
fortify
my
soul
against
the
two
events
that
appear
to
me
horrid
as
an
approaching
execution
to
a
guilty
wretch
the
parting
with
my
children
and
the
meeting
with
my
mother
as
the
letter
i
wrote
will
miss
of
her
at
i
shall
write
to
london
to
prepare
her
to
receive
the
wretch
whom
her
imagination
has
figured
to
her
so
happy
lady
v
i
hear
her
coming
up
stairs
i
can
not
conceal
my
affliction
nor
my
disgrace
lady
v
has
left
me
left
me
in
astonishment
and
new
horror
mrs
gerrarde
who
do
you
think
mrs
gerrarde
is
she
is
the
aunt
of
miss
burchell
that
aunt
who
betrayed
her
to
destruction
sure
this
woman
was
sent
into
the
world
for
a
scourge
i
can
not
collect
myself
to
tell
you
with
any
method
the
conversation
that
passed
between
lady
v
and
me
she
found
me
with
the
marks
of
tears
on
my
face
they
streamed
again
at
the
sight
of
her
i
could
not
conceal
the
cause
and
i
put
mr
arnold
letter
into
her
hands
for
i
was
not
able
to
tell
her
the
purport
of
it
this
is
mrs
gerrarde
doing
said
she
the
detestable
creature
how
could
she
work
on
your
infatuated
husband
to
drive
him
such
horrid
lengths
i
know
not
said
i
but
i
hope
my
lady
v
believes
me
innocent
innocent
she
exclaimed
my
dear
creature
your
sufferings
almost
make
me
mad
do
you
know
that
mrs
gerrarde
has
an
intrigue
with
your
husband
i
fear
so
madam
i
replied
but
i
hoped
it
was
not
publick
poor
child
said
lady
v
his
attachment
to
her
has
been
no
secret
ever
since
he
came
down
to
this
country
though
probably
you
were
the
last
to
suspect
it
i
have
often
dreaded
the
consequences
of
it
but
never
imagined
it
would
have
come
to
this
i
always
had
a
bad
opinion
of
the
woman
and
only
kept
up
a
face
of
civility
to
her
in
her
husband
time
on
account
of
her
niece
a
charming
girl
that
then
lived
with
her
but
since
miss
burchell
has
left
her
i
have
almost
dropt
my
acquaintance
with
her
though
my
lord
who
had
an
old
friendship
for
captain
gerrarde
persuades
me
to
be
civil
to
her
the
name
of
miss
burchell
had
struck
me
speechless
the
clue
was
now
unravelled
with
what
an
unremitting
zeal
has
this
base
woman
gone
on
in
her
career
of
iniquity
lady
v
who
was
intirely
taken
up
with
the
thoughts
of
my
unhappiness
took
no
notice
of
my
silence
or
confusion
what
do
you
mean
to
do
my
dear
mrs
arnold
said
she
do
you
think
it
is
not
possible
by
the
interposition
of
friends
to
disabuse
your
unfortunate
husband
for
unfortunate
he
is
in
a
higher
degree
than
yourself
as
you
have
conscious
innocence
to
support
you
oh
madam
said
i
it
is
in
vain
to
think
of
it
mrs
gerrarde
has
struck
the
blow
effectually
were
mr
arnold
left
to
the
workings
of
his
own
heart
he
might
perhaps
relent
but
that
woman
like
my
evil
genius
and
his
will
take
care
to
keep
his
suspicions
alive
she
possesses
his
whole
heart
and
my
removal
is
become
necessary
to
the
quiet
of
them
both
i
have
taken
this
resolution
i
will
immediately
quit
this
house
and
leave
it
to
a
righteous
god
to
vindicate
me
in
his
own
time
you
should
go
no
where
but
to
my
house
said
lady
v
with
tears
in
her
eyes
but
that
i
think
it
an
improper
situation
for
you
while
mr
faulkland
is
my
guest
he
will
be
distracted
when
he
hears
of
this
i
conjured
lady
v
not
to
tell
him
my
being
parted
from
my
husband
can
not
long
be
a
secret
said
i
but
the
cause
may
lady
v
told
me
that
mr
faulkland
was
that
very
morning
set
out
for
to
see
my
brother
having
received
a
letter
from
him
the
day
before
in
which
he
told
him
that
my
mother
was
going
in
a
day
or
two
to
london
and
begged
he
would
come
and
spend
a
week
with
him
she
added
that
mr
faulkland
purposed
doing
so
and
then
to
return
to
v
hall
as
my
lord
had
obtained
a
promise
from
him
to
stay
some
time
longer
with
them
at
least
till
the
old
lady
affairs
were
settled
who
had
left
her
fortune
to
mr
faulkland
and
to
whom
my
lord
v
was
executor
i
told
lady
v
i
depended
on
her
friendship
to
keep
this
affair
a
secret
from
mr
faulkland
lest
the
heat
of
his
temper
should
make
him
take
such
notice
of
it
as
might
render
my
separation
from
mr
arnold
doubly
injurious
to
my
character
lady
v
saw
the
necessity
of
this
caution
and
promised
to
observe
it
she
expressed
great
surprize
at
mr
faulkland
visiting
mrs
gerrarde
whom
she
said
she
did
not
imagine
he
had
been
acquainted
with
he
is
no
stranger
said
she
to
your
amour
with
her
as
it
has
often
been
a
topic
of
discourse
between
my
lord
and
me
and
i
can
hardly
think
he
would
be
so
indelicate
as
to
carry
on
a
with
such
an
abandoned
creature
especially
as
i
have
often
heard
him
express
the
utmost
detestation
of
her
on
account
of
her
robbing
you
of
your
husband
affection
which
i
had
observed
for
a
good
while
but
there
is
no
knowing
mankind
added
she
if
that
should
be
the
case
you
may
depend
upon
it
that
vile
gerrarde
has
laid
her
plan
deeper
than
we
are
aware
of
and
would
us
all
that
faulkland
came
to
her
house
for
no
other
purpose
than
to
have
an
opportunity
of
seeing
you
who
to
be
sure
she
said
had
given
him
a
private
hint
to
meet
you
there
now
the
worst
of
it
is
it
is
impossible
to
have
this
matter
cleared
up
to
your
husband
without
mr
faulkland
concurrence
and
that
you
will
not
consent
to
by
no
means
i
replied
i
would
not
for
the
world
have
mr
faulkland
interfere
in
my
justification
if
the
affair
should
really
be
as
you
have
suggested
a
little
time
may
perhaps
discover
this
wicked
woman
to
mr
arnold
and
it
will
not
then
be
so
difficult
to
clear
my
innocence
at
present
her
influence
over
him
is
too
powerful
for
me
to
combat
with
and
i
know
he
wishes
for
nothing
more
than
to
free
himself
from
the
restraint
that
my
presence
lays
him
under
lady
v
acquiesced
in
my
opinion
and
said
she
hoped
a
little
time
would
chace
away
the
dark
cloud
that
now
hung
over
me
she
staid
with
me
the
whole
day
it
was
a
day
of
tears
the
dear
woman
was
quite
subdued
at
parting
with
me
i
see
you
no
more
dear
lady
v
said
i
i
shall
go
to
london
in
two
days
preserve
your
fortitude
dearest
mrs
arnold
she
replied
the
time
will
come
when
your
husband
will
repent
of
the
bitter
distress
he
has
occasioned
to
you
my
lord
and
i
will
use
our
utmost
endeavours
to
convince
him
of
his
we
shall
meet
in
london
my
dear
i
shall
go
thither
early
in
the
winter
on
purpose
have
courage
your
innocence
be
cleared
i
answered
her
not
my
heart
was
too
full
we
embraced
and
lady
v
parted
from
me
in
silence
i
have
written
to
my
mother
and
directed
my
letter
to
st
i
would
have
her
prepared
for
the
shock
before
she
sees
me
a
shock
which
i
fear
she
will
not
be
able
to
sustain
mrs
gerrarde
has
never
called
or
sent
to
me
since
i
was
at
her
house
she
has
effected
her
purpose
and
is
contented
without
a
triumph
i
am
prepared
for
my
departure
i
turn
my
back
upon
my
husband
house
and
upon
my
children
i
have
been
weeping
over
them
this
hour
as
they
lie
asleep
in
their
nurse
arms
but
i
will
look
at
them
no
poor
patty
is
almost
dead
with
grief
she
would
fain
go
with
me
but
i
have
persuaded
her
to
stay
i
can
rely
on
her
fidelity
and
her
tenderness
towards
my
children
she
says
she
be
as
precious
of
them
as
the
apple
of
her
eyes
and
will
give
me
an
account
of
their
welfare
from
time
to
time
sure
mr
arnold
will
not
turn
out
too
she
is
an
excellent
manager
and
he
can
not
do
without
a
housekeeper
i
have
been
debating
with
myself
whether
i
should
write
to
mr
arnold
or
not
and
have
at
length
determined
to
depart
in
silence
it
is
an
easy
matter
for
the
guilty
to
make
as
bold
asseverations
as
the
innocent
and
nothing
which
i
could
now
assert
would
make
an
impression
on
him
had
i
only
his
suspicions
to
combat
there
might
be
hopes
but
his
is
alienated
from
me
and
while
it
continues
attached
to
another
i
despair
of
his
listening
to
the
voice
of
reason
or
of
justice
if
ever
his
eyes
are
opened
his
error
will
prove
sufficient
punishment
to
him
perhaps
my
mother
or
my
brother
may
put
me
in
a
way
my
conduct
in
time
i
hope
may
justify
me
mean
while
i
will
not
condescend
to
the
weak
justification
of
words
i
have
bid
adieu
to
and
arrived
this
morning
in
london
in
a
hired
carriage
for
i
would
not
take
one
of
mr
arnold
i
found
my
mother
at
the
house
in
st
where
i
now
am
she
got
here
late
last
night
and
my
letter
had
thrown
her
into
agonies
from
which
she
had
not
yet
recovered
what
have
you
wrote
to
me
said
she
as
she
held
me
in
her
arms
your
dreadful
letter
has
almost
killed
me
sure
sure
my
dear
child
it
can
not
be
true
that
you
have
left
your
husband
what
is
the
cause
what
have
done
or
what
has
done
i
begged
my
mother
to
compose
herself
a
little
and
then
related
to
her
every
circumstance
in
the
same
manner
you
have
had
them
as
they
occurred
her
lamentations
pierced
my
heart
she
wrung
her
hands
in
bitterness
of
anguish
why
did
not
the
grave
hide
me
said
she
before
i
saw
shame
and
sorrow
heaped
upon
my
child
i
came
to
die
in
peace
with
you
you
might
have
lengthened
my
days
for
a
while
but
you
cut
them
off
my
eyes
will
close
in
affliction
a
wounded
spirit
who
can
bear
had
you
died
in
your
cradle
we
had
both
been
happy
my
child
would
now
have
been
a
cherub
an
angel
you
would
have
been
in
my
eyes
and
i
am
punished
for
it
but
that
was
crime
not
your
but
you
are
a
martyr
to
the
crimes
of
others
my
mother
wept
not
all
this
time
i
wished
she
had
her
passionate
looks
and
tones
affected
me
more
than
tears
could
my
eyes
began
to
run
over
her
soon
accompanied
me
and
it
a
little
relieved
the
vehemence
of
her
grief
she
then
began
to
reproach
herself
for
having
listened
to
lady
grimston
suggestions
in
favour
of
mr
arnold
and
for
her
own
solliciting
this
fatal
marriage
but
i
stopped
her
on
a
subject
which
i
knew
would
so
much
torment
her
thoughts
i
conjured
her
not
to
reflect
on
it
in
that
manner
i
told
her
i
knew
she
had
acted
for
the
best
and
that
nothing
but
an
extraordinary
fatality
which
could
neither
be
foreseen
nor
avoided
had
made
me
unhappy
i
said
i
was
sure
mr
arnold
had
been
seduced
by
the
wiles
of
a
wicked
woman
for
that
he
was
by
nature
a
good
man
and
that
he
had
more
of
my
pity
than
of
my
resentment
i
found
it
necessary
to
reconcile
my
mother
to
herself
on
this
head
she
seemed
willing
to
lay
hold
on
the
hint
and
turned
all
her
indignation
against
mrs
gerrarde
a
sinner
she
called
her
for
whom
nothing
could
be
said
in
extenuation
of
her
crime
we
now
turned
our
thoughts
towards
fixing
on
some
other
abode
you
may
be
sure
mr
arnold
house
is
no
place
for
us
and
my
mother
declared
she
would
not
stay
another
night
in
it
accordingly
we
have
dispatched
her
maid
to
take
us
lodgings
immediately
we
have
quickly
shifted
the
scene
my
dear
cecilia
and
are
settled
at
least
for
the
present
in
very
handsome
lodgings
in
st
we
came
to
them
last
night
and
my
mother
seems
a
little
less
disturbed
than
she
was
i
pray
god
spare
her
life
but
i
fear
i
shall
not
long
enjoy
that
blessing
she
is
sadly
altered
since
i
last
saw
her
a
dropsical
complaint
is
stealing
on
her
fast
her
legs
are
swelled
and
she
has
intirely
lost
her
appetite
yet
if
her
mind
were
a
little
more
at
ease
i
should
hope
that
by
the
assistance
she
can
have
here
she
might
be
enabled
to
hold
out
against
this
disorder
for
a
good
while
i
endeavour
to
suppress
my
own
grief
that
i
may
not
increase
her
volume
ii
i
was
surprized
by
a
visitor
to
my
mother
miss
burchell
came
to
pay
her
respects
to
her
i
have
told
you
they
corresponded
my
mother
it
seems
had
given
her
notice
of
the
time
she
intended
being
in
town
the
young
lady
had
been
to
wait
on
her
in
st
james
street
and
was
from
thence
directed
by
the
servant
who
kept
the
house
to
our
new
lodgings
she
is
really
a
very
lovely
young
woman
and
there
is
something
so
insinuating
in
her
manner
that
there
is
no
seeing
her
without
being
prejudiced
in
her
favour
she
changed
colour
when
my
mother
presented
me
to
her
by
my
name
but
at
the
same
time
surveyed
me
with
a
scrutinous
eye
my
mother
asked
her
had
she
seen
mr
faulkland
since
his
return
to
england
she
answered
no
with
a
sigh
but
that
she
believed
he
had
been
to
putney
to
see
his
son
said
my
mother
without
reflecting
that
miss
burchell
had
avoided
mentioning
that
circumstance
and
stopped
upon
naming
the
place
where
the
child
was
at
nurse
yes
she
replied
in
a
timorous
accent
and
stealing
a
look
at
me
the
woman
told
me
that
a
young
gentleman
had
been
there
about
six
weeks
ago
who
said
he
came
from
the
child
father
abroad
and
made
her
a
handsome
present
as
i
did
not
then
know
mr
faulkland
was
returned
to
england
i
should
not
have
suspected
it
was
he
himself
who
had
called
if
his
housekeeper
that
gentlewoman
in
whose
care
he
left
me
had
not
come
to
me
from
him
she
is
settled
now
in
a
and
mr
faulkland
on
his
coming
to
london
went
to
her
to
enquire
where
the
child
was
she
told
me
he
inquired
civilly
after
me
and
gave
her
a
letter
for
me
which
the
woman
joyfully
brought
me
but
it
contained
nothing
but
a
bill
of
a
hundred
pounds
with
two
or
three
lines
polite
indeed
but
not
kind
to
inform
me
it
was
for
the
child
use
and
i
have
heard
nothing
of
him
since
my
mother
told
her
that
as
mr
faulkland
was
returned
again
probably
to
continue
in
england
she
did
not
despair
of
his
being
brought
to
do
her
justice
especially
as
she
must
suppose
the
sight
of
the
child
had
made
an
impression
on
him
she
then
without
ceremony
entered
into
a
detail
of
my
unhappy
story
she
was
full
of
it
and
being
as
you
know
of
a
very
communicative
temper
made
no
scruple
to
inform
miss
burchell
of
every
particular
she
seemed
very
much
affected
with
the
story
and
grew
red
and
pale
by
turns
especially
at
finding
her
aunt
so
deeply
concerned
in
it
she
exclaimed
against
her
barbarity
reproached
mr
arnold
for
his
injurious
suspicions
and
condoled
obligingly
with
me
on
the
wrongs
i
had
received
and
yet
my
cecilia
would
you
believe
it
i
thought
i
could
discover
through
all
this
that
miss
burchell
was
not
entirely
free
from
doubt
in
regard
to
my
innocence
this
observation
i
gathered
only
from
certain
looks
that
she
cast
at
me
as
my
mother
related
the
passages
there
are
little
minute
touches
on
the
countenance
sometimes
which
are
so
transient
they
can
hardly
be
overtaken
by
the
eye
and
which
from
the
passions
being
strongly
guarded
that
give
rise
to
these
emotions
are
so
slight
that
a
common
observer
can
not
discover
them
at
all
i
am
sure
my
mother
did
not
but
my
sensibility
was
particularly
rouzed
at
her
relating
a
story
that
i
did
not
then
wish
to
have
divulged
and
i
was
too
much
interested
in
the
narrative
not
to
attend
precisely
to
its
effects
on
the
hearer
i
am
neither
angry
with
nor
surprized
at
miss
burchell
for
her
scepticism
on
this
occasion
she
loves
mr
faulkland
and
had
not
herself
the
power
to
resist
him
she
knows
he
once
loved
me
and
may
fancy
he
does
so
still
nay
thinks
perhaps
i
am
not
indifferent
towards
him
she
is
a
stranger
to
heart
but
is
convinced
that
her
aunt
is
base
enough
first
to
ensnare
to
vice
and
then
to
betray
upon
the
whole
there
is
nothing
unnatural
in
her
suspicions
but
i
think
they
could
not
proceed
from
a
virtuous
mind
upon
miss
burchell
taking
leave
my
mother
gave
her
a
general
invitation
to
come
to
her
as
often
as
she
had
leisure
telling
her
she
must
not
take
it
amiss
if
she
did
not
return
her
visits
as
her
health
would
not
permit
her
to
go
much
abroad
miss
burchell
it
seems
has
a
house
not
lodgings
in
a
retired
street
in
westminster
where
she
has
been
ever
since
she
quitted
her
aunt
to
whom
she
never
discovered
where
she
lived
her
fortune
enables
her
to
appear
very
genteelly
in
the
private
manner
she
chuses
to
live
she
goes
but
seldom
into
publick
and
has
but
a
narrow
circle
of
acquaintance
those
are
all
of
her
own
sex
and
of
the
best
character
and
she
has
had
the
good
fortune
to
preserve
her
reputation
unsuspected
so
that
i
hope
she
may
yet
retrieve
her
error
by
an
advantageous
match
should
mr
faulkland
still
continue
averse
to
her
i
have
had
a
letter
from
patty
she
tells
me
her
master
is
returned
home
and
adds
be
sure
that
vile
wicked
wretch
let
him
know
you
were
gone
she
says
he
called
for
the
two
dear
babes
and
kissed
them
both
patty
carried
the
youngest
to
him
in
her
arms
the
other
in
her
hand
and
she
says
he
looked
troubled
how
came
you
not
to
follow
your
lady
mrs
martha
said
he
she
replied
my
lady
was
willing
sir
that
i
should
stay
to
look
after
the
children
and
to
be
a
spy
upon
my
actions
i
suppose
is
that
not
to
be
part
of
your
employment
too
ah
patty
patty
mrs
arnold
had
better
have
looked
to
her
own
conduct
patty
made
no
answer
but
retired
in
tears
every
one
in
the
house
she
writes
is
but
that
mr
arnold
is
never
at
home
spending
his
whole
time
with
mrs
gerrarde
whom
the
girl
in
the
overflowings
of
her
zeal
for
me
heartily
execrates
she
informed
him
that
i
was
gone
to
london
and
purposed
living
with
my
mother
who
was
now
there
i
have
just
received
a
letter
from
lady
v
she
tells
me
she
sent
twice
to
mr
arnold
to
dine
with
them
in
order
if
possible
to
lead
him
into
a
conversation
by
which
they
hoped
in
some
measure
to
have
cleared
my
innocence
as
my
lord
could
take
upon
him
to
justify
mr
faulkland
but
he
declined
coming
not
knowing
perhaps
that
mr
faulkland
was
absent
from
v
hall
she
said
her
lord
had
gone
to
but
either
mr
arnold
was
not
at
home
or
denied
himself
my
lady
adds
is
a
delicate
affair
to
interpose
in
yet
would
i
have
ventured
to
have
wrote
to
your
husband
if
i
had
been
sure
that
you
had
no
objection
to
my
telling
him
that
you
had
made
me
privy
to
the
cause
of
your
parting
is
plain
by
his
avoiding
us
it
is
a
subject
he
does
not
care
to
come
to
an
explanation
upon
let
me
have
your
sentiments
and
i
will
act
accordingly
i
shall
answer
lady
v
letter
directly
and
beg
of
her
to
leave
the
matter
as
it
is
mrs
gerrarde
testimony
will
have
more
weight
than
all
my
good
lord
or
lady
could
urge
in
my
favour
besides
they
are
not
furnished
with
sufficient
weapons
to
combat
against
such
an
enemy
they
know
nothing
of
miss
burchell
story
my
regard
to
character
prevented
me
from
giving
my
lady
this
specimen
of
her
aunt
baseness
i
suppose
the
same
reason
may
have
closed
mr
faulkland
lips
on
that
subject
so
that
they
have
nothing
to
allege
against
mrs
gerrarde
which
would
help
to
invalidate
her
testimony
with
regard
to
mr
faulkland
and
me
mr
arnold
indeed
knows
that
she
has
forfeited
her
pretensions
to
modesty
but
the
delusion
of
blinds
a
man
in
those
cases
and
he
can
believe
that
and
inhabit
the
bosom
of
her
whose
passion
for
alone
has
caused
a
deviation
from
chastity
i
can
not
think
of
exposing
the
poor
miss
burchell
by
giving
up
her
secret
though
it
might
contribute
to
clear
me
by
turning
mr
suspicions
on
mrs
gerrarde
yet
would
she
have
great
reason
to
resent
it
more
especially
as
she
is
now
by
a
blameless
life
endeavouring
to
blot
out
the
memory
of
her
fault
though
my
lady
v
is
very
prudent
her
zeal
for
me
and
my
lord
earnestness
in
my
cause
might
render
them
unguarded
on
the
occasion
and
should
they
attempt
to
make
use
of
this
secret
in
order
to
eliminate
mrs
gerrarde
it
might
at
the
same
time
bring
malicious
censures
both
on
miss
burchell
and
mr
faulkland
i
think
upon
the
whole
my
mother
is
the
properest
person
to
mediate
on
this
occasion
when
mr
arnold
comes
to
town
she
can
with
due
tenderness
to
the
young
lady
disclose
the
whole
affair
to
him
the
knowlege
of
this
black
part
of
mrs
gerrarde
character
joined
to
her
arguments
may
perhaps
have
some
weight
though
to
tell
you
the
secret
bodings
of
my
heart
i
expect
not
much
from
this
i
have
lost
my
husband
love
mrs
gerrarde
possesses
it
all
and
who
knows
whether
he
even
wishes
to
lose
his
pretence
for
abandoning
an
unhappy
wife
i
wish
however
mr
faulkland
were
returned
to
v
hall
should
mr
arnold
know
of
his
absence
at
this
juncture
he
might
imagine
possibly
he
was
gone
in
quest
of
me
how
the
scene
is
changed
my
sister
what
a
melancholy
reverse
is
here
to
my
late
prospect
of
domestic
happiness
i
pass
my
nights
in
tears
and
bitter
reflections
on
my
dismal
situation
my
days
are
spent
in
a
painful
constraint
to
conceal
the
anguish
of
my
own
heart
that
i
may
not
aggravate
that
of
my
poor
mother
my
endeavours
to
be
chearful
i
perceive
have
a
good
effect
on
her
she
is
much
more
composed
and
seems
resigned
to
our
fate
patiently
waiting
for
a
change
i
think
too
she
is
rather
better
in
her
health
she
has
had
the
advice
of
a
physician
of
eminent
skill
the
medicines
prescribed
he
gives
us
hopes
will
keep
her
disorder
at
least
from
gaining
ground
and
that
she
may
hold
out
for
some
years
i
have
prevailed
on
her
not
to
give
sir
george
an
account
of
my
unhappy
story
till
i
hear
that
mr
faulkland
has
left
him
because
i
know
my
brother
would
conceal
nothing
from
him
and
if
possible
i
would
have
mr
arnold
suspicions
of
concealed
i
have
many
reasons
for
this
my
own
delicacy
would
receive
a
wound
by
it
for
who
knows
what
judgment
mr
faulkland
might
form
on
this
knowlege
but
my
most
material
objection
is
should
he
attempt
to
vindicate
his
own
honour
what
might
be
the
consequence
i
shudder
to
think
of
it
i
know
mr
faulkland
is
rash
when
provoked
rather
let
my
sufferings
and
my
disgrace
lie
wrapped
in
oblivion
than
bring
any
disaster
on
the
father
of
my
children
another
letter
from
lady
v
she
tells
me
that
mr
faulkland
is
returned
from
his
visit
to
my
brother
he
was
soon
informed
of
my
parting
with
mr
arnold
is
the
talk
of
the
neighbourhood
every
body
lays
it
on
mrs
gerrarde
mr
faulkland
was
very
inquisitive
to
learn
particulars
from
my
lady
which
he
said
he
was
sure
i
had
told
her
but
she
took
care
not
to
give
him
the
least
hint
which
could
lead
him
to
suppose
that
had
any
share
in
my
fate
she
says
he
raves
like
a
madman
and
that
she
finds
it
absolutely
necessary
to
keep
him
in
ignorance
of
the
truth
she
was
obliged
to
tell
him
that
my
having
discovered
mr
arnold
amour
with
mrs
gerrarde
she
believed
was
the
sole
cause
of
our
separation
he
asked
her
was
she
there
was
no
other
adding
that
he
thought
my
temper
had
been
too
gentle
to
fly
on
a
sudden
to
such
extremes
my
lady
took
occasion
to
ask
him
whether
he
did
not
visit
mrs
gerrarde
he
replied
he
did
sometimes
having
formerly
known
her
at
bath
she
concludes
with
telling
me
that
mr
arnold
is
become
quite
invisible
to
every
friend
he
has
mrs
gerrarde
engrossing
him
wholly
i
hope
mr
faulkland
may
not
suspect
how
much
is
concerned
in
my
misfortune
my
absenting
myself
for
some
time
before
i
left
home
from
v
hall
and
my
departure
from
my
husband
immediately
after
my
interview
with
mr
faulkland
at
mrs
gerrarde
may
raise
some
distrust
in
his
mind
but
while
it
continues
merely
surmise
he
can
have
no
pretence
for
requiring
an
explanation
from
mr
arnold
so
that
if
my
husband
keeps
his
own
council
which
he
seems
inclined
to
do
and
my
lord
and
lady
v
preserve
the
secret
i
shall
rest
satisfied
my
mother
has
written
to
sir
george
and
given
him
a
full
account
of
my
situation
with
a
request
which
i
prevailed
on
her
to
make
that
he
would
not
take
any
notice
of
the
affair
till
he
saw
us
my
brother
perhaps
may
think
of
a
way
with
tenderness
and
safety
to
remove
mr
arnold
doubts
without
farther
exposing
my
reputation
or
laying
my
husband
open
to
mischief
a
prudent
cool
and
at
the
same
time
zealous
friend
might
devise
some
means
to
effect
this
but
i
fear
my
disregard
to
mr
arnold
his
diminished
love
for
me
and
his
resentment
to
my
mother
will
prevent
him
from
engaging
with
that
alacrity
or
precaution
that
the
nicety
of
circumstances
may
require
i
will
therefore
wait
with
patience
till
god
in
his
own
time
shall
raise
me
from
the
state
of
humiliation
into
which
i
am
fallen
with
what
a
tortoise
pace
does
time
advance
to
the
wretched
how
dismal
are
those
hours
which
are
spent
in
reflecting
on
lost
happiness
o
faulkland
how
light
was
thy
transgression
if
we
consider
the
consequences
compared
to
that
which
has
driven
me
from
my
home
and
from
my
children
steeled
my
husband
heart
against
me
heaped
infamy
on
head
and
loaded
my
mother
age
with
sorrow
and
remorse
all
this
is
the
fatal
consequence
of
mr
arnold
breach
of
his
all
this
and
much
more
i
fear
that
is
to
come
we
keep
ourselves
entirely
concealed
from
the
knowlege
of
all
our
acquaintance
not
a
mortal
visits
us
but
now
and
then
miss
burchell
and
i
have
never
stirred
out
of
doors
but
to
church
sir
george
has
answered
my
mother
letter
just
as
i
feared
he
would
he
speaks
of
mr
arnold
with
more
contempt
and
aversion
than
he
does
of
me
with
pity
or
brotherly
kindness
he
says
is
well
for
him
that
mr
faulkland
knows
not
of
his
injurious
suspicions
of
him
or
he
would
vindicate
himself
in
a
manner
he
little
thinks
of
he
tells
us
he
does
not
know
at
this
distance
how
to
advise
but
that
as
i
am
of
so
and
a
spirit
he
thinks
my
wrongs
may
sleep
till
he
comes
to
town
which
can
not
yet
be
these
three
or
four
weeks
having
leases
to
renew
with
his
tenants
and
abundance
of
other
business
to
do
in
the
so
much
for
george
tenderness
my
comforts
are
circumscribed
within
a
very
narrow
compass
for
i
can
not
reckon
one
but
what
i
receive
from
poor
patty
letters
who
never
fails
to
send
me
weekly
an
account
of
my
dear
little
children
they
are
well
thank
god
and
not
yet
abandoned
by
their
father
but
even
the
knowlege
of
this
is
imbittered
by
repeated
hints
of
mr
arnold
lost
condition
lost
i
may
call
it
for
his
whole
soul
is
absorbed
in
the
mad
pursuit
of
his
own
ruin
the
poor
girl
in
the
bitterness
of
her
indignation
tells
me
he
has
made
mrs
gerrarde
a
present
of
a
favourite
little
pad
of
mine
she
says
she
had
a
mind
to
tear
her
off
when
she
saw
her
mounted
upon
it
i
wish
not
to
be
told
of
any
of
mr
arnold
motions
and
should
forbid
patty
to
write
to
me
any
thing
upon
the
subject
but
that
i
fear
my
letter
might
fall
into
mr
arnold
hands
his
curiosity
might
lead
him
to
open
it
for
the
conscious
mind
will
descend
to
meannesses
and
if
he
should
see
my
prohibition
he
would
be
satisfied
that
his
servant
was
too
free
in
her
censures
i
am
sure
he
is
quite
unconcerned
at
knowing
his
conduct
but
i
would
not
nevertheless
for
my
sake
bring
this
tender
faithful
poor
creature
into
disgrace
with
him
by
convincing
him
of
the
liberty
she
takes
though
he
may
very
naturally
suspect
it
a
lady
of
our
acquaintance
who
happened
to
see
me
at
church
came
to
pay
me
a
visit
it
seems
she
is
intimate
with
the
widow
arnold
who
told
her
very
lately
that
she
was
impatient
for
the
commencement
of
term
as
she
then
expected
the
cause
depending
between
her
and
us
would
be
brought
to
a
final
issue
and
determined
intirely
in
her
child
favour
this
account
alarmed
my
poor
mother
so
much
that
she
could
not
be
easy
till
she
sent
for
our
lawyer
who
was
so
obliging
as
to
come
upon
the
first
summons
she
acquainted
him
with
the
cause
of
her
apprehensions
and
asked
him
whether
there
was
any
likelihood
of
the
widow
succeeding
he
laughed
at
my
mother
fears
and
at
our
antagonist
flourishes
as
he
called
them
and
said
he
would
not
give
a
bent
to
ensure
mr
arnold
estate
to
him
which
the
ensuing
term
he
says
will
put
out
of
the
reach
of
doubt
this
assurance
has
quieted
our
anxiety
on
that
head
the
loss
of
our
suit
would
indeed
be
a
dreadful
blow
as
we
should
have
nothing
then
remaining
but
my
small
jointure
for
the
support
of
mr
arnold
myself
and
our
two
children
not
to
mention
mrs
gerrarde
who
i
have
reason
to
believe
has
been
no
inconsiderable
sharer
in
mr
arnold
fortune
six
melancholy
weeks
are
gone
since
i
have
been
here
i
may
say
both
a
prisoner
and
a
fugitive
i
count
the
days
as
they
pass
as
if
i
expected
some
revolution
in
my
fate
yet
whence
is
it
to
come
no
prospect
as
yet
opens
to
me
mr
arnold
will
soon
call
him
to
town
something
may
then
happen
but
does
not
mrs
gerrarde
come
too
he
can
not
live
without
her
and
i
shall
reap
no
benefit
from
this
but
the
chance
of
seeing
my
children
sometimes
perhaps
though
he
may
not
bring
them
with
him
or
if
he
does
he
may
be
cruel
enough
to
refuse
me
the
sight
of
them
sir
george
is
cold
and
dilatory
were
he
on
the
spot
something
might
be
done
he
might
expostulate
my
mother
too
could
join
arguments
to
intreaties
mr
arnold
perhaps
might
be
recovered
from
his
delusion
it
is
but
a
perhaps
my
brother
is
arrived
in
town
sooner
than
we
expected
and
came
this
evening
to
pay
us
a
visit
my
altered
and
dejected
looks
i
believe
shocked
him
but
george
wants
tenderness
or
at
least
a
capacity
of
shewing
it
after
a
recapitulation
of
my
story
he
asked
me
i
be
so
a
creature
as
ever
to
think
of
living
with
arnold
again
even
though
he
should
be
inclined
to
desire
it
i
told
him
he
considered
the
matter
in
a
wrong
light
and
that
he
ought
to
reflect
on
my
reputation
and
the
future
welfare
of
my
two
poor
little
girls
who
would
be
material
sufferers
from
the
want
of
my
care
and
attention
as
they
grew
up
not
to
mention
the
disadvantages
they
would
enter
life
with
by
my
continuing
under
an
aspersion
which
might
in
time
become
very
public
as
i
made
no
doubt
but
that
mrs
gerrarde
would
take
pains
to
propagate
it
wherever
she
went
my
mother
added
mr
arnold
too
might
be
saved
from
perdition
if
he
could
be
so
far
convinced
of
his
innocence
as
to
be
reconciled
to
her
and
live
with
her
again
and
pray
said
sir
george
how
is
this
to
be
done
if
that
damned
woman
has
put
it
into
his
head
that
faulkland
and
you
are
fond
of
one
another
do
you
imagine
that
he
will
believe
what
say
what
your
brother
or
your
mother
or
even
faulkland
himself
could
say
to
the
contrary
i
own
to
you
very
fairly
that
i
so
much
despise
the
man
that
unless
you
will
give
me
leave
to
talk
to
him
my
own
way
i
will
have
nothing
to
say
to
him
at
all
would
you
have
me
to
him
for
a
reconciliation
and
try
to
persuade
him
out
of
the
belief
of
an
imaginary
injury
which
probably
he
was
glad
to
make
a
handle
of
to
get
rid
of
you
no
sidney
you
may
be
as
tame
as
you
please
yourself
but
it
does
not
become
your
brother
to
be
so
when
i
go
to
him
i
must
insist
upon
not
having
rules
prescribed
to
me
your
delicacy
in
regard
to
faulkland
asserting
your
innocence
i
have
nothing
to
say
against
but
there
can
be
no
objection
to
your
brother
vindicating
the
honour
of
his
family
i
saw
sir
george
resentment
was
rouzed
to
the
highest
pitch
his
eyes
sparkled
with
indignation
and
his
whole
frame
seemed
agitated
dear
brother
said
i
i
conjure
you
and
i
fell
upon
my
knees
and
clasped
both
my
arms
around
his
do
not
add
to
my
affliction
by
involving
yourself
and
my
husband
in
a
fatal
quarrel
what
difference
would
it
make
to
me
if
mr
arnold
should
fall
whether
it
is
by
your
hand
or
mr
faulkland
the
loss
would
be
the
same
the
misfortune
the
publication
of
my
disgrace
the
same
your
husband
said
he
breaking
from
me
though
a
little
softened
would
have
as
good
a
chance
as
i
if
it
came
to
the
hazard
or
perhaps
he
might
condescend
to
take
you
again
if
you
will
have
it
so
without
coming
to
these
extremities
if
i
am
suffered
to
argue
properly
with
i
will
not
consent
to
your
seeing
him
at
all
said
i
eagerly
the
cause
is
now
my
own
he
answered
coolly
but
i
will
do
nothing
to
aggravate
your
distress
i
did
not
like
the
manner
in
which
he
spoke
my
mother
who
till
now
had
been
silent
caught
the
alarm
let
me
intreat
you
son
said
she
to
drop
the
thoughts
of
any
violent
methods
with
mr
arnold
if
you
value
your
sister
peace
or
have
any
regard
to
the
obedience
you
owe
me
i
insist
on
it
that
you
neither
see
him
nor
write
to
him
without
our
knowlege
and
consent
and
if
you
do
not
promise
me
this
i
renounce
all
ties
of
kindred
or
affection
to
you
your
mother
has
as
just
a
sense
of
the
honour
of
her
family
as
you
can
have
but
it
is
not
on
so
hot
a
head
and
so
weak
an
arm
that
she
depends
to
see
it
justified
to
the
world
sir
george
who
was
nettled
at
my
mother
spirited
rebuke
made
her
a
low
bow
no
doubt
of
it
madam
said
he
there
will
be
a
miracle
wrought
in
my
sister
favour
i
would
have
you
let
her
try
the
experiment
of
the
ordeal
i
dare
say
she
would
come
off
victorious
and
then
mr
arnold
would
do
you
the
favour
to
take
her
home
again
i
wish
said
my
mother
gravely
that
there
was
a
possibility
of
bringing
my
dear
innocence
to
such
a
proof
i
would
not
hesitate
a
minute
to
put
it
to
the
trial
but
since
there
is
no
such
a
thing
i
will
wait
till
god
in
his
own
righteousness
shall
judge
her
cause
and
clear
her
to
the
world
therefore
son
i
insist
upon
your
promise
before
you
leave
me
i
give
you
my
word
madam
answered
sir
george
i
will
not
attempt
to
hold
any
conference
with
mr
arnold
without
your
knowlege
will
that
satisfy
you
it
does
answered
my
mother
for
i
think
i
can
rely
upon
your
word
sir
george
left
us
not
very
well
satisfied
with
each
other
his
pride
and
resentment
piqued
to
the
highest
i
can
not
censure
him
for
it
here
he
has
cause
but
the
case
is
a
nice
and
difficult
one
the
gratification
of
a
private
spleen
ought
not
to
enter
into
the
measures
he
should
pursue
glad
i
am
that
my
mother
resolution
has
tamed
him
a
little
though
george
sometimes
fails
in
the
respect
which
he
owes
her
yet
i
never
knew
him
wilfully
to
disobey
her
commands
or
oppose
her
inclinations
is
well
there
is
any
hold
on
a
disposition
so
ungentle
and
as
his
my
brother
has
taken
a
very
handsome
house
in
and
told
my
mother
between
jest
and
earnest
he
is
going
to
give
her
a
to
make
up
for
the
loss
of
her
he
is
in
reality
making
his
addresses
to
lady
sarah
p
the
daughter
of
a
peer
she
has
a
great
fortune
he
tells
me
but
i
know
nothing
more
of
her
i
wish
him
better
success
in
his
nuptials
if
they
take
place
than
i
have
had
mr
arnold
is
arrived
in
town
he
came
late
last
night
and
his
man
called
this
morning
to
enquire
how
i
did
the
poor
fellow
stole
out
before
his
master
was
up
and
was
afraid
of
staying
a
minute
lest
he
should
be
wanted
at
home
i
called
him
up
to
the
i
saw
an
honest
shame
and
sorrow
in
his
countenance
how
does
your
master
do
frank
said
i
has
he
brought
the
children
to
town
no
madam
said
he
but
they
are
pure
and
hearty
i
believe
my
master
thought
it
a
pity
to
bring
them
out
of
the
fresh
air
as
long
as
mrs
patty
is
there
to
look
after
them
they
are
better
where
they
are
i
asked
him
was
mr
arnold
come
to
town
to
make
any
stay
i
believe
for
good
and
all
said
he
this
ugly
to
be
sure
will
detain
him
but
he
is
come
said
he
with
an
intelligent
nod
i
do
suppose
though
he
will
continue
long
so
well
frank
said
i
i
am
glad
to
hear
your
master
and
the
children
are
well
ah
madam
shaking
his
head
as
he
opened
the
door
to
go
out
it
was
a
woeful
day
for
us
when
you
left
south
park
god
give
every
one
their
reward
i
have
not
seen
my
brother
these
two
days
he
does
not
know
i
believe
that
mr
arnold
is
come
to
town
though
if
he
did
i
am
sure
he
will
not
break
his
word
so
that
i
am
easy
on
that
particular
my
mother
says
she
will
go
to
mr
arnold
herself
to
with
him
a
little
i
shall
not
oppose
it
though
i
have
no
hopes
of
her
being
able
to
effect
any
thing
in
my
favour
she
is
now
laid
up
with
a
cold
and
is
not
able
to
come
out
of
her
room
but
she
pleases
herself
with
the
thought
of
this
visit
as
soon
as
she
is
able
to
make
it
she
has
planned
what
she
intends
to
say
to
him
and
is
resolved
to
let
him
into
the
whole
history
of
miss
burchell
that
he
may
know
she
says
the
full
extent
of
mrs
wickedness
as
what
is
there
of
which
that
woman
is
not
capable
who
could
set
to
sale
the
honour
of
an
innocent
unsuspecting
creature
left
to
her
guardianship
amazing
my
dear
cecilia
i
thought
i
should
wonder
no
more
at
any
thing
yet
is
my
wonder
now
raised
to
astonishment
i
have
just
received
a
letter
from
lady
v
i
have
read
it
over
and
over
again
and
can
yet
scarce
believe
my
senses
here
it
is
in
her
own
words
suppose
you
know
my
dear
mrs
arnold
that
your
husband
is
in
town
and
that
he
left
mrs
gerrarde
behind
him
for
no
other
reason
i
imagine
but
that
he
did
not
chuse
to
be
quite
so
scandalous
as
to
let
her
travel
with
him
for
we
heard
that
she
purposed
following
him
in
a
few
days
patty
i
conclude
may
have
informed
you
of
thus
much
but
the
extraordinary
part
of
the
intelligence
i
believe
is
reserved
for
me
to
acquaint
you
with
know
then
that
mrs
gerrarde
is
eloped
knows
whither
you
say
good
should
say
too
but
for
the
conclusion
of
my
story
it
is
with
mr
she
is
eloped
is
positively
true
she
went
off
with
him
in
triumph
last
night
in
her
own
chariot
and
neither
of
them
have
been
heard
of
since
i
own
i
am
so
much
confounded
at
this
i
scarce
know
what
i
write
am
very
glad
for
your
sake
that
bad
creature
has
quitted
your
husband
but
that
she
should
have
drawn
my
cousin
faulkland
in
is
a
matter
of
serious
concern
to
me
it
is
evident
the
plan
was
previously
concerted
between
them
for
i
am
informed
that
mrs
gerrarde
maid
decamped
at
the
same
time
and
took
with
her
every
thing
valuable
belonging
to
her
mistress
several
of
her
drawers
being
found
open
and
empty
mr
faulkland
servants
have
also
disappeared
so
that
we
can
not
conjecture
which
way
they
are
gone
faulkland
who
was
about
leaving
us
asked
my
permission
to
give
a
ball
to
the
neighbouring
ladies
in
our
new
room
which
is
just
finished
as
i
concluded
he
would
ask
nobody
but
our
own
acquaintances
i
readily
consented
and
my
lord
you
know
is
fond
of
those
frolics
i
own
i
was
surprized
to
see
mrs
gerrarde
amongst
the
company
as
undaunted
as
the
face
there
i
would
not
however
confront
mr
faulkland
so
much
as
to
shew
any
disrespect
to
one
who
was
at
that
time
guest
but
i
was
out
of
all
patience
to
find
that
along
with
several
others
was
asked
to
supper
my
lord
joining
in
the
invitation
mr
faulkland
made
a
pretence
to
wait
on
her
home
and
the
audacious
creature
took
that
opportunity
to
march
off
with
him
as
faulkland
really
purposed
leaving
v
hall
the
next
day
i
think
it
would
have
been
but
decent
in
him
to
have
forbore
this
piece
of
barefaced
libertinism
till
he
was
fairly
from
under
roof
he
might
have
made
his
assignation
in
any
other
place
but
i
suppose
the
lady
had
a
mind
to
shew
the
world
she
is
above
restraint
and
chose
to
make
her
infamy
a
sort
of
triumph
am
quite
angry
with
my
lord
for
only
laughing
at
this
and
calling
it
a
piece
of
spirited
gallantry
in
them
both
he
says
he
is
delighted
to
think
how
your
good
man
will
shake
his
ears
when
he
hears
his
mistress
has
left
him
in
the
lurch
and
gone
off
with
another
lover
i
should
smile
too
but
that
it
makes
me
sad
to
think
that
mr
faulkland
of
whom
i
had
so
good
an
opinion
should
so
impose
upon
my
judgment
and
forfeit
his
own
character
for
so
vile
a
creature
me
my
dear
madam
i
am
so
full
of
my
own
reflections
on
the
interest
take
in
this
affair
that
i
have
been
forgetful
of
how
much
more
moment
it
may
be
to
heaven
grant
that
your
husband
may
think
of
making
himself
amends
in
returning
to
a
faithful
and
amiable
wife
for
the
loss
of
a
deceitful
jilting
mistress
surely
this
event
must
open
his
eyes
or
he
deserves
to
lose
them
i
hope
to
embrace
you
in
london
in
a
very
little
time
till
then
believe
me
dear
mrs
arnold
most
assured
friend
and
servant
hall
well
my
cecilia
what
say
you
to
this
are
you
not
as
much
surprized
as
i
am
mr
faulkland
to
emerge
at
last
the
favoured
gallant
of
mrs
gerrarde
prodigious
i
confess
my
dear
i
am
so
selfish
as
not
to
participate
with
lady
v
in
her
uneasiness
on
this
occasion
that
mrs
gerrarde
flies
from
my
husband
i
am
glad
and
that
mr
is
the
very
man
she
chose
to
fly
with
i
am
still
gladder
he
of
all
men
living
i
would
have
wished
though
least
expected
to
be
the
person
this
explains
every
thing
that
is
passed
surely
as
lady
v
says
this
open
mr
arnold
eyes
i
can
now
discover
a
double
reason
for
my
poor
deluded
man
having
his
imagination
poisoned
with
jealousy
mrs
gerrarde
did
not
aim
singly
at
separating
my
husband
and
me
this
perhaps
was
but
a
secondary
consideration
or
who
knows
whether
it
was
at
all
intended
but
she
most
certainly
designed
to
secure
herself
against
all
suspicions
by
making
me
the
object
of
them
and
effectually
to
blind
mr
arnold
persuaded
him
that
mr
faulkland
visits
made
to
her
were
only
in
the
hope
of
seeing
me
let
her
views
have
been
what
they
would
this
event
was
beyond
my
hopes
some
glimmerings
of
comfort
begin
to
break
in
upon
me
methinks
my
heart
feels
much
lighter
than
it
did
how
sir
george
will
stare
at
this
account
my
mother
will
lift
up
her
eyes
but
she
has
no
opinion
of
mr
faulkland
morals
and
therefore
will
be
the
less
surprized
i
pity
miss
burchell
this
is
an
irremediable
bar
to
her
hopes
faint
and
unsupported
as
they
were
before
they
must
now
entirely
vanish
i
gave
you
a
copy
of
lady
v
letter
while
the
subject
was
warm
at
my
heart
and
before
i
shewed
it
to
any
one
but
my
mother
and
my
brother
have
now
both
seen
it
my
mother
just
as
i
expected
without
any
great
emotions
of
surprize
only
exclaimed
against
their
wickedness
but
said
she
could
not
help
rejoicing
in
it
as
she
hoped
would
derive
happiness
from
their
accumulated
crimes
sir
george
read
the
letter
twice
over
before
he
uttered
a
word
and
then
said
it
was
upon
his
soul
most
unaccountable
and
that
either
faulkland
was
run
mad
or
that
woman
had
bewitched
him
when
he
was
with
me
said
he
at
sidney
castle
he
did
not
so
much
as
mention
her
i
asked
him
whether
he
was
acquainted
with
mr
arnold
for
i
had
written
him
word
of
your
marriage
when
he
was
abroad
he
told
me
he
had
seen
both
you
and
him
two
or
three
times
at
lord
v
but
that
as
he
did
not
wish
to
renew
his
acquaintance
with
you
he
had
never
visited
your
husband
i
presume
he
was
not
then
a
stranger
to
his
connection
with
mrs
gerrarde
at
least
to
the
conjectures
of
the
neighbourhood
upon
it
but
as
it
was
then
but
a
matter
of
opinion
and
he
knew
not
of
the
difference
between
you
and
your
husband
is
probable
he
did
not
chuse
to
disgust
me
more
against
my
by
hinting
at
this
circumstance
he
expressed
great
acknowlegements
to
my
mother
when
i
told
him
of
the
notice
she
had
taken
of
miss
burchell
though
he
said
he
found
from
my
account
of
your
marriage
that
she
had
deferred
her
conference
with
that
young
lady
till
it
was
too
late
for
her
testimony
to
be
of
any
service
to
him
as
i
knew
nothing
of
what
had
passed
between
my
mother
and
miss
burchell
i
could
give
him
no
satisfaction
on
that
subject
and
the
recollection
of
past
transactions
being
equally
disagreeable
to
us
both
i
avoided
ever
mentioning
them
after
our
first
conversation
nor
do
i
remember
that
mrs
gerrarde
name
occurred
once
my
mother
now
began
to
exult
over
sir
george
and
took
advantage
of
the
surprize
and
consternation
that
lady
v
letter
had
thrown
him
into
this
is
your
boasted
friend
said
she
the
man
whose
and
were
not
to
be
questioned
and
whose
crime
was
a
youthful
folly
that
he
was
surprized
into
with
a
silly
girl
i
am
pleased
however
that
has
proved
i
was
not
so
grossly
mistaken
in
believing
him
a
loose
man
mrs
gerrarde
is
the
fittest
mate
for
him
and
i
am
glad
they
are
gone
together
sir
george
was
too
much
mortified
at
the
flagrant
misconduct
of
his
friend
to
attempt
excusing
him
he
contented
himself
with
repeating
it
was
the
strangest
thing
he
ever
knew
in
his
life
my
mother
then
told
him
mr
arnold
was
come
to
town
and
that
as
things
had
taken
such
a
turn
she
hoped
herself
to
be
able
to
bring
him
to
the
use
of
his
judgment
and
therefore
thought
it
would
not
be
at
all
necessary
for
my
brother
to
interfere
sir
george
said
with
all
his
heart
if
her
ladyship
should
be
able
to
patch
up
a
reconciliation
that
would
save
his
sister
credit
and
she
could
be
so
pliant
as
to
think
of
living
with
such
a
husband
again
he
should
not
give
himself
any
farther
trouble
about
the
matter
but
in
opinion
the
affair
wore
a
much
odder
aspect
than
it
did
before
i
find
mr
faulkland
behaviour
sticks
with
him
and
has
a
little
cooled
his
zeal
towards
him
i
have
had
a
letter
from
patty
who
confirms
my
lady
v
account
of
the
lovers
flight
and
she
tells
me
one
of
mrs
gerrarde
servants
is
gone
off
express
to
town
i
suppose
to
bring
mr
arnold
the
news
for
they
are
all
in
confusion
at
her
house
and
know
not
what
is
become
of
their
mistress
but
they
are
certain
she
is
gone
with
mr
faulkland
patty
adds
the
servants
believe
this
scheme
had
long
been
concerted
mr
faulkland
having
been
a
private
visitor
to
their
mistress
for
a
good
while
i
must
confess
i
am
astonished
at
it
it
has
sunk
the
man
extremely
in
my
opinion
miss
burchell
has
just
been
here
poor
creature
she
is
quite
stunned
with
the
news
she
could
scarce
believe
it
at
first
till
my
mother
desired
i
would
shew
her
lady
v
letter
and
patty
which
corroborated
all
she
said
she
then
gave
way
to
tears
and
lamentations
saying
that
cruel
woman
was
born
to
be
the
destruction
of
she
had
any
connection
with
have
found
it
so
madam
to
me
have
done
so
too
mr
arnold
i
believe
has
been
a
great
sufferer
mr
faulkland
is
her
victim
inconsiderate
and
barbarous
as
he
is
i
grieve
for
him
i
have
heard
nothing
of
mr
arnold
indeed
it
is
hardly
possible
that
i
should
we
are
shut
up
here
from
all
commerce
with
the
world
my
mother
illness
has
confined
her
to
her
we
admit
no
visitors
and
i
never
leave
her
i
long
to
know
how
he
takes
the
ingratitude
of
his
mistress
but
i
see
nobody
who
converses
with
him
my
brother
and
miss
burchell
are
the
only
people
we
see
the
latter
is
pretty
often
with
us
as
for
sir
george
he
only
looks
in
upon
us
now
and
then
and
we
all
seem
in
an
aukward
situation
i
wish
my
mother
were
well
enough
to
call
on
mr
arnold
i
am
very
anxious
to
know
what
his
sentiments
are
at
least
in
regard
to
mrs
gerrarde
i
have
been
almost
asleep
my
dear
cecilia
for
this
week
past
but
i
have
been
rouzed
this
morning
in
a
most
extraordinary
manner
sir
george
called
on
us
he
ran
up
stairs
in
a
violent
hurry
and
had
a
countenance
when
he
entered
the
room
that
spoke
wonders
before
he
opened
his
mouth
he
hardly
gave
himself
time
to
ask
me
how
i
did
though
he
had
not
seen
me
for
three
days
before
he
took
a
bundle
of
papers
out
of
his
pocket
which
he
gave
me
is
from
faulkland
said
he
and
may
be
worth
your
knowlege
upon
opening
the
cover
i
found
it
contained
at
least
four
sheets
of
paper
written
on
every
side
bless
me
brother
said
i
do
you
expect
i
should
take
the
trouble
to
read
all
this
he
answered
you
may
read
it
at
your
leisure
you
will
find
it
will
pay
you
for
the
mighty
trouble
of
a
perusal
sir
george
left
me
presently
and
having
read
this
extraordinary
letter
to
myself
for
i
happened
to
be
in
my
own
room
when
my
brother
came
to
me
i
sate
me
down
to
give
you
a
copy
of
it
my
mother
who
coughed
almost
the
whole
night
is
now
endeavouring
to
get
a
little
sleep
so
that
i
will
scribble
on
as
fast
as
i
can
while
i
have
no
interruption
my
dear
bidulph
i
am
in
haste
to
vindicate
myself
to
you
but
in
much
more
haste
to
do
so
to
mrs
arnold
who
if
she
bestows
a
thought
at
all
on
me
must
i
am
sure
hold
me
in
the
utmost
contempt
and
great
reason
would
she
have
if
things
were
always
as
they
appear
methinks
i
see
her
beautiful
scorn
at
hearing
i
had
carried
off
mrs
gerrarde
what
a
paltry
fellow
must
think
me
too
and
yet
i
carried
her
off
and
she
is
now
in
my
possession
not
displeased
with
her
situation
and
i
might
if
i
would
be
as
happy
as
mrs
gerrarde
can
make
me
but
i
assure
you
sir
george
i
have
no
designs
but
what
are
for
the
good
both
of
her
soul
and
body
and
i
have
hitherto
treated
her
like
a
vestal
what
a
paradox
is
here
say
you
but
have
patience
till
i
tell
you
the
story
of
my
you
are
to
know
then
that
as
arnold
amour
with
mrs
gerrarde
was
no
secret
at
v
hall
from
the
moment
i
heard
it
i
meditated
a
design
of
breaking
the
detestable
union
not
out
of
regard
either
to
him
or
her
but
in
hopes
of
restoring
to
the
most
amiable
of
women
a
besotted
husband
heart
which
nothing
but
downright
magic
infernal
witchcraft
could
have
robbed
her
of
the
woman
is
handsome
is
true
but
she
is
a
silly
toad
and
as
fantastic
as
an
ape
i
had
formed
this
design
i
say
from
the
first
notice
i
had
of
the
intrigue
and
in
consequence
of
this
resolved
to
renew
my
acquaintance
with
mrs
gerrarde
for
i
had
her
before
known
her
to
my
cost
she
it
was
this
identical
devil
whom
i
have
now
in
my
power
that
was
the
cause
of
miss
burchell
misfortune
and
therefore
the
remote
cause
of
my
losing
miss
bidulph
had
it
not
been
for
her
i
should
never
have
had
the
fall
of
that
unhappy
girl
to
answer
for
should
not
i
say
mark
that
for
the
mercenary
witch
was
determined
to
sell
her
to
somebody
when
my
ill
stars
threw
me
in
her
way
i
do
not
rank
this
affair
in
the
number
of
capital
crimes
and
yet
i
never
think
of
it
without
a
pang
if
half
of
my
fortune
would
retrieve
the
girl
peace
of
mind
i
would
give
it
freely
but
it
is
past
now
and
can
not
be
helped
she
had
the
good
fortune
never
to
be
suspected
and
if
she
keeps
her
own
council
probably
never
will
if
i
die
a
bachelor
as
i
believe
i
shall
i
will
leave
her
my
whole
fortune
what
can
a
man
do
more
how
i
ramble
from
my
subject
i
meant
only
to
tell
you
what
my
design
was
in
carrying
off
mrs
gerrarde
in
order
to
effect
it
as
i
said
before
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
renew
my
acquaintance
with
her
and
accordingly
i
put
on
a
bold
face
and
made
her
a
visit
she
was
not
surprized
at
this
our
former
intimacy
giving
me
a
sufficient
pretence
for
it
she
received
me
with
a
pleased
familiarity
which
convinced
me
my
company
was
far
from
being
disagreeable
to
her
and
i
am
sure
had
my
views
been
other
than
they
were
i
should
have
met
with
as
kind
a
reception
as
my
heart
could
have
wished
for
she
certainly
thought
of
retaining
me
in
her
service
unknown
to
arnold
i
was
soon
aware
of
this
for
though
she
often
desired
to
see
me
she
always
contrived
it
at
such
times
as
she
was
sure
of
not
being
surprized
by
him
this
was
in
some
measure
meeting
my
purpose
halfway
but
though
i
wanted
to
disengage
her
from
arnold
i
did
not
mean
to
sacrifice
myself
to
her
and
our
views
in
the
material
point
were
very
different
mine
were
only
to
part
her
from
her
gallant
her
were
to
share
her
favours
between
us
for
she
did
not
intend
to
let
go
her
hold
on
him
and
i
believe
my
backwardness
in
pushing
my
good
fortune
began
to
disgust
her
but
the
time
for
carrying
my
plan
into
execution
was
not
yet
arrived
it
could
not
be
till
arnold
departure
from
i
meant
to
carry
mrs
gerrarde
away
with
the
appearance
of
her
own
consent
and
i
knew
this
was
impossible
whilst
her
lover
remained
so
near
her
i
had
formed
but
a
rough
sketch
of
my
plan
when
i
received
your
letter
which
summoned
me
to
and
i
resolved
not
to
apprize
you
of
it
till
my
enterprize
was
crowned
with
success
more
especially
as
you
were
then
quite
ignorant
of
your
sister
wrongs
on
my
return
from
visiting
you
the
first
news
i
heard
at
v
hall
was
that
mr
arnold
and
his
lady
were
parted
i
curst
my
own
dilatoriness
that
i
had
not
executed
my
plan
before
things
were
brought
to
such
extremities
for
i
well
knew
it
was
that
artful
fiend
who
had
occasioned
it
though
i
then
little
thought
how
fatally
had
contributed
towards
the
misfortune
of
the
and
of
women
lady
v
told
me
that
your
sister
having
discovered
her
infidelity
had
left
him
on
that
account
but
my
lord
soon
let
me
into
the
whole
secret
oh
sir
george
that
angel
who
deserved
the
first
monarch
in
the
universe
to
be
cast
off
by
an
undiscerning
dolt
and
though
innocently
the
accursed
cause
i
can
not
think
with
patience
of
what
the
divine
creature
has
suffered
on
my
account
but
was
it
not
all
from
the
beginning
owing
to
mrs
gerrarde
that
avenging
fury
sent
on
earth
as
a
scourge
for
the
sins
of
me
and
of
my
ancestors
i
rave
but
no
wonder
i
am
mad
upon
this
but
to
return
i
then
recollected
that
the
day
before
i
set
out
for
sidney
castle
i
received
a
message
from
mrs
gerrarde
in
the
morning
desiring
my
company
to
drink
coffee
with
her
that
evening
i
obeyed
the
summons
little
expecting
to
meet
mrs
arnold
at
her
house
whom
i
had
never
seen
there
before
the
effect
my
presence
had
on
her
extremely
surprized
me
she
presently
quitted
the
room
mrs
gerrarde
took
that
opportunity
of
telling
me
that
she
had
dropped
in
on
her
very
unexpectedly
but
as
she
supposed
she
would
go
directly
away
we
should
have
an
hour
to
chat
by
ourselves
she
then
followed
your
sister
out
and
i
remained
alone
in
the
parlour
whilst
i
was
reflecting
on
this
odd
encounter
which
i
did
not
then
imagine
had
been
brought
about
by
design
mrs
gerrarde
came
in
to
me
saying
your
sister
was
so
ill
she
was
under
a
necessity
of
accompanying
her
home
and
had
ordered
her
chariot
for
that
purpose
she
made
an
apology
for
being
obliged
to
leave
me
and
said
she
should
be
glad
to
see
me
the
next
day
i
took
my
leave
and
in
going
out
saw
mr
arnold
at
the
door
which
i
judged
was
the
true
reason
of
mrs
dismissing
me
i
set
out
for
wiltshire
the
next
morning
and
though
there
was
something
odd
in
the
whole
of
this
incident
i
believed
it
was
owing
to
chance
alone
and
thought
no
more
of
it
till
upon
my
lord
v
telling
me
the
true
cause
of
your
sister
disgrace
i
found
that
this
serpent
had
laid
the
whole
plan
on
purpose
to
destroy
her
you
see
for
to
be
sure
you
know
all
the
particulars
how
she
seduced
the
innocent
mrs
arnold
into
this
fatal
visit
having
first
engaged
me
to
come
at
the
very
point
of
time
when
she
knew
the
husband
would
surprize
us
for
coming
you
may
be
satisfied
was
not
unexpected
i
own
to
you
sir
george
in
the
first
motions
of
my
rage
i
could
have
stabbed
arnold
mrs
gerrarde
and
myself
but
my
lord
v
calmed
my
transports
by
telling
me
that
it
was
your
sister
earnest
request
that
this
detestable
secret
should
be
kept
from
my
knowlege
and
that
lady
v
who
had
intrusted
him
with
it
would
never
forgive
him
if
she
knew
he
had
divulged
it
this
reflection
brought
me
back
to
my
senses
and
i
burned
with
impatience
to
execute
my
first
plan
which
mrs
gerrarde
repeated
crimes
now
called
upon
me
to
accelerate
i
communicated
my
design
to
lord
v
who
was
delighted
with
it
for
he
perfectly
adores
your
sister
this
said
he
though
not
such
a
vengeance
as
that
wicked
woman
deserves
must
in
the
end
be
productive
of
what
you
wish
and
mrs
arnold
may
be
restored
to
her
peace
without
injury
to
her
character
or
mischief
to
having
settled
my
measures
with
lord
v
i
went
to
pay
a
visit
to
mrs
gerrarde
the
cockatrice
affected
to
speak
with
surprize
and
concern
of
your
sister
separation
from
her
husband
i
asked
her
had
she
who
was
so
intimate
with
both
heard
any
reason
assigned
for
it
she
shook
her
head
and
by
a
pretended
sorrow
in
her
looks
and
a
mysterious
silence
invited
me
to
press
for
an
explanation
of
her
meaning
she
told
me
at
length
with
a
seeming
reluctance
that
mrs
arnold
though
to
be
sure
she
was
a
sensible
woman
was
not
without
the
little
frailties
and
passions
of
her
sex
and
that
and
as
her
suspicions
were
she
had
taken
it
into
her
head
to
be
jealous
of
mr
arnold
and
with
whom
do
you
think
of
all
people
she
suspects
him
i
can
not
imagine
said
i
why
truly
with
replied
the
undaunted
jezebel
and
looked
as
if
she
expected
should
be
as
much
amazed
as
she
pretended
to
be
i
affected
to
laugh
at
it
and
changing
the
discourse
put
an
end
to
my
visit
the
measures
i
had
to
observe
required
some
management
it
would
not
answer
the
full
extent
of
my
purpose
to
rob
mr
arnold
of
his
dear
if
it
did
not
appear
at
the
same
time
that
she
had
left
him
with
her
own
consent
to
bring
about
this
it
was
necessary
that
the
flight
on
her
part
should
seem
premeditated
which
would
not
carry
any
face
unless
she
took
with
her
such
of
her
moveables
as
were
most
valuable
this
i
knew
could
not
be
done
without
the
assistance
of
her
maid
whom
i
therefore
not
only
resolved
to
trust
but
also
to
make
her
a
partner
in
her
mistress
elopement
having
settled
thus
much
of
the
plan
in
my
own
mind
i
began
my
operations
by
making
the
maid
presents
every
time
i
visited
the
mistress
and
i
took
care
to
give
those
visits
as
much
the
air
of
an
amour
as
i
possibly
could
i
dare
swear
the
girl
thought
mrs
gerrarde
and
i
were
upon
the
best
terms
imaginable
i
affected
to
come
at
such
hours
as
i
was
sure
mrs
gerrarde
was
alone
i
always
made
my
visits
short
as
if
through
fear
of
being
surprized
with
her
and
went
so
far
as
to
leave
my
chariot
when
i
came
in
it
at
a
distance
from
the
house
and
walked
to
it
alone
with
the
caution
of
one
fearful
of
being
observed
it
was
a
matter
of
indifference
to
me
whether
mrs
gerrarde
knew
of
this
or
not
my
business
was
only
to
excite
suspicions
of
an
intrigue
amongst
her
servants
in
order
to
answer
a
future
purpose
but
if
she
were
to
know
with
what
extreme
precaution
i
visited
her
my
prudence
could
not
but
be
very
agreeable
to
her
she
had
her
measures
to
observe
as
well
as
myself
as
it
was
of
consequence
to
her
to
conceal
our
acquaintance
from
arnold
knowlege
she
must
necessarily
be
pleased
at
the
pains
i
took
without
her
laying
herself
open
in
making
the
request
to
conceal
it
from
him
and
she
saw
i
was
as
careful
as
she
could
wish
never
to
interfere
with
him
in
short
we
carried
on
a
private
intercourse
that
if
it
could
not
be
called
gallantry
was
something
very
like
it
for
i
amused
complimented
and
flattered
her
so
agreeably
that
i
believe
she
began
to
think
herself
sure
of
me
and
wondered
i
did
not
make
a
better
use
of
the
favourable
disposition
she
was
in
towards
me
but
i
trifled
with
such
dexterity
that
even
she
with
all
the
cunning
she
is
mistress
of
could
not
possibly
fathom
my
design
having
thus
laid
the
foundation
of
my
plot
i
made
no
doubt
of
being
able
to
execute
it
with
my
lord
v
assistance
he
was
in
raptures
at
the
thought
of
our
enterprize
and
swore
he
would
never
have
forgiven
me
if
i
had
not
allowed
him
a
share
in
it
he
said
i
would
give
my
to
make
mrs
arnold
happy
adding
besides
it
will
save
her
husband
from
destruction
for
to
my
knowlege
that
woman
has
already
almost
ruined
his
fortune
i
asked
him
might
we
venture
to
let
my
lady
into
the
secret
he
said
by
no
means
my
lady
was
too
squeamish
to
be
trusted
with
such
a
notable
exploit
but
when
the
affair
was
over
he
would
take
upon
him
to
excuse
me
to
her
after
he
had
diverted
himself
a
little
with
her
surprize
i
fretted
to
death
at
arnold
staying
so
long
in
the
country
as
it
delayed
my
enterprize
there
was
one
circumstance
indeed
that
a
little
compensated
for
this
vexation
and
that
was
that
my
long
stay
at
v
hall
which
could
be
no
secret
to
him
though
he
dropped
visiting
there
on
purpose
to
avoid
me
might
in
some
measure
help
to
efface
his
injurious
suspicions
with
regard
to
his
lady
and
me
besides
it
gave
the
better
colour
to
my
other
designs
at
last
the
opportunity
arrived
arnold
was
obliged
to
go
to
london
on
his
i
took
care
to
inform
myself
of
the
day
from
mrs
gerrarde
maid
and
learnt
at
the
same
time
that
her
mistress
purposed
going
to
town
in
a
week
after
for
she
still
endeavoured
to
save
appearances
and
dared
to
the
last
to
pretend
to
reputation
i
proposed
giving
a
ball
to
take
my
leave
of
the
ladies
on
the
night
subsequent
to
the
day
fixed
for
arnold
departure
from
my
lord
almost
as
anxious
for
the
event
as
myself
immediately
dispatched
invitations
all
over
the
neighbourhood
there
was
not
a
person
of
any
fashion
left
unasked
mr
arnold
and
mrs
gerrarde
you
may
be
sure
were
not
forgot
from
the
former
as
we
expected
we
received
a
civil
apology
from
the
latter
a
message
that
she
would
be
sure
to
come
this
was
at
the
distance
of
eight
days
from
the
appointed
time
in
the
interim
i
continued
to
visit
mrs
gerrarde
as
usual
and
took
care
to
bespeak
her
for
a
partner
arnold
went
to
town
as
opportunely
as
we
could
wish
i
called
on
mrs
gerrarde
the
same
morning
and
having
my
lord
permission
for
it
engaged
her
to
come
early
enough
to
drink
tea
as
there
were
a
good
many
more
ladies
invited
for
the
same
purpose
and
at
going
away
i
dropped
a
few
mysterious
hints
to
her
maid
in
the
evening
there
was
a
very
large
company
met
at
v
hall
and
having
concerted
my
whole
plan
when
the
ladies
were
engaged
at
the
i
slipped
out
mounted
my
horse
and
rode
to
mrs
house
i
desired
to
see
her
maid
and
taking
her
aside
told
her
not
to
be
surprized
but
that
her
lady
was
to
go
off
with
me
that
night
that
the
thing
had
for
certain
reasons
not
been
determined
on
till
that
very
evening
that
i
had
just
snatched
a
minute
to
desire
her
to
get
all
her
ladies
trinkets
together
and
whatever
money
and
bills
she
might
have
in
her
escruitore
in
order
to
this
i
gave
her
a
parcel
of
small
keys
which
i
had
carried
in
my
pocket
for
the
purpose
and
bid
her
hold
herself
in
readiness
against
seven
when
a
person
should
call
on
her
who
would
conduct
her
to
a
place
where
she
should
find
her
lady
and
me
i
needed
no
arguments
to
persuade
the
girl
the
thing
appeared
plausible
enough
she
was
fully
convinced
of
the
intimacy
between
her
mistress
and
me
and
knowing
her
too
well
to
have
a
doubt
of
her
baseness
she
concluded
i
acted
by
mrs
gerrarde
directions
and
promised
punctually
to
obey
them
she
said
she
could
easily
carry
away
in
the
dark
as
many
things
as
she
could
conveniently
carry
and
to
avoid
observation
from
the
rest
of
the
servants
she
would
wait
at
a
cottage
hard
by
which
she
named
to
me
till
her
conductor
arrived
whether
any
of
the
keys
i
gave
her
would
fit
the
locks
or
not
i
was
not
much
concerned
if
they
did
not
i
concluded
she
would
think
her
mistress
had
made
a
mistake
and
that
she
would
force
them
open
rather
than
fail
having
settled
this
material
point
i
got
back
to
my
lord
v
without
having
been
missed
by
the
company
our
ball
was
very
well
conducted
i
danced
with
mrs
gerrarde
and
we
passed
a
very
agreeable
evening
we
supped
at
twelve
and
she
had
ordered
her
chariot
to
come
a
little
after
that
hour
but
i
had
given
my
fellows
their
cue
as
the
dancing
was
not
renewed
the
company
broke
up
between
one
and
two
mrs
gerrarde
was
one
of
the
first
that
offered
to
go
but
as
her
servants
were
not
to
be
found
she
was
detained
till
else
had
taken
their
leave
at
length
her
coachman
and
footman
were
found
in
the
cellar
with
one
of
my
mean
all
so
drunk
that
they
were
not
able
to
stand
her
servants
were
really
so
and
mine
counterfeited
so
well
there
was
no
discovering
the
cheat
in
this
emergency
nothing
was
more
natural
than
the
offering
my
servants
to
attend
her
home
and
of
course
to
wait
on
her
myself
to
see
her
safe
she
readily
accepted
the
first
offer
but
declined
the
other
this
was
easily
got
over
i
handed
her
into
her
chariot
and
stepped
in
after
her
our
route
was
settled
we
drove
from
my
lord
v
door
and
turning
short
from
the
road
that
led
to
mrs
gerrarde
house
we
struck
down
a
lane
which
was
to
carry
us
by
to
our
first
destined
stage
which
was
at
the
distance
of
seven
miles
this
was
no
other
than
a
poor
gardener
house
to
which
place
two
of
my
emissaries
had
been
dispatched
that
day
to
wait
our
coming
with
a
travelling
chariot
and
four
stout
horses
i
had
taken
care
according
to
promise
to
send
a
trusty
groom
for
the
maid
with
a
boy
to
carry
her
luggage
they
were
both
well
mounted
and
had
orders
to
carry
her
to
an
inn
on
the
road
to
rochester
and
within
about
a
mile
of
the
town
this
inn
was
kept
by
a
fellow
who
had
formerly
been
my
servant
i
had
placed
him
there
and
he
was
intirely
at
my
devotion
he
had
already
received
his
instructions
and
his
house
was
to
be
our
second
stage
i
concluded
the
maid
had
arrived
there
long
before
us
having
had
six
or
seven
hours
the
start
of
us
and
the
place
was
not
more
than
twenty
miles
from
her
own
house
mrs
gerrarde
was
not
immediately
aware
of
our
going
out
of
the
road
she
was
in
high
spirits
and
i
kept
her
in
chat
as
soon
as
she
perceived
it
she
cried
out
with
some
surprize
lord
mr
faulkland
where
is
the
fellow
carrying
us
he
has
missed
his
way
she
called
to
him
but
the
coachman
who
had
orders
not
to
stop
unless
i
spoke
to
him
only
drove
the
faster
pray
do
call
to
him
said
she
the
wretch
has
certainly
got
drunk
with
the
rest
of
the
servants
i
told
her
there
was
no
possibility
of
turning
in
the
narrow
road
in
which
we
then
were
that
when
we
got
out
of
it
i
would
speak
to
the
coachman
and
begged
of
her
in
the
mean
while
not
to
be
frightened
the
lane
was
a
very
long
one
but
our
rapid
wheels
soon
carried
us
to
the
end
of
it
where
i
had
appointed
pivet
and
one
of
my
footmen
to
meet
us
on
horseback
i
had
another
servant
behind
the
chariot
whom
i
purposed
to
send
back
with
it
in
the
morning
at
the
sight
of
two
horsemen
who
were
apparently
waiting
for
us
she
screamed
out
oh
the
villain
he
has
brought
us
here
to
be
robbed
she
had
a
good
many
jewels
on
her
and
to
say
the
truth
had
some
reason
for
her
fears
the
chariot
had
now
got
on
a
good
open
road
and
the
horses
rather
flew
than
galloped
the
two
horsemen
joined
us
and
kept
up
with
us
at
full
speed
i
saw
she
was
heartily
frightened
and
thought
it
time
to
undeceive
her
i
was
not
enough
to
keep
her
longer
under
the
apprehensions
of
highwaymen
and
thought
she
would
be
less
shocked
at
finding
there
was
a
design
upon
her
person
than
on
her
diamond
now
said
i
taking
one
of
her
hands
with
rather
more
freedom
than
respect
since
we
are
out
of
all
danger
of
discovery
or
any
possibility
of
pursuit
i
will
tell
you
a
secret
and
i
spoke
with
an
easy
assured
tone
she
drew
her
hand
away
what
do
you
mean
sir
nothing
madam
but
to
have
the
pleasure
of
your
company
in
a
little
trip
i
am
going
to
take
believe
me
you
are
not
in
the
least
danger
you
are
under
my
protection
those
are
my
servants
that
you
see
riding
with
us
and
you
may
judge
of
the
value
i
set
upon
you
by
the
pains
i
have
taken
to
get
you
into
my
possession
lord
mr
faulkland
why
sure
you
ca
be
serious
never
more
so
in
my
life
madam
i
have
long
had
a
design
upon
you
but
your
connection
with
mr
arnold
connection
with
mr
arnold
sir
interrupting
me
i
do
understand
you
come
come
mrs
gerrarde
you
and
i
are
old
acquaintance
you
know
is
no
time
for
dissembling
he
has
been
a
happy
man
long
enough
is
time
for
a
woman
of
your
spirit
to
be
tired
of
him
especially
as
i
think
i
may
say
without
vanity
you
do
not
change
for
the
worse
in
falling
into
my
hands
the
lady
had
now
recovered
her
courage
she
was
no
longer
in
fears
of
being
robbed
and
her
spirits
returned
you
audacious
creature
how
dare
you
treat
me
thus
have
you
the
assurance
to
insinuate
that
there
was
any
thing
criminal
in
my
attachment
to
mr
arnold
and
his
family
my
dear
madam
i
accuse
you
of
no
attachment
to
any
of
his
family
he
himself
was
the
person
sure
there
never
was
such
an
impertinent
wretch
but
i
know
the
author
of
this
scandal
it
was
mrs
and
she
dared
to
prophane
your
sister
honoured
name
but
i
despise
her
and
mr
arnold
shall
soon
know
how
i
have
been
affronted
and
she
fell
a
my
dear
mrs
gerrarde
i
beg
your
pardon
i
did
not
mean
to
offend
you
if
mr
arnold
admired
you
he
did
no
more
than
what
every
man
does
who
sees
you
i
beseech
you
to
compose
yourself
by
all
that
is
good
i
mean
you
no
harm
be
calm
i
conjure
you
and
do
spoil
the
prettiest
face
in
england
with
crying
a
daring
provoking
creature
she
sobbed
what
could
put
such
an
attempt
as
this
in
your
head
and
to
what
place
are
you
carrying
me
only
to
france
my
dear
creature
have
you
have
been
there
to
france
to
france
she
exclaimed
and
do
you
dare
to
think
you
shall
carry
me
there
oh
you
like
it
of
all
things
said
i
when
you
get
there
what
do
you
think
her
reply
was
why
neither
more
nor
less
than
a
good
box
on
the
ear
i
catched
hold
of
her
hand
and
kissed
it
you
charming
vixen
how
i
admire
you
for
your
spirit
she
endeavoured
to
wrest
her
hand
from
me
but
i
held
them
both
fast
for
fear
of
another
blow
base
insolent
ravisher
villain
as
she
rose
in
her
epithets
i
replied
with
lovely
charming
adorable
tender
gentle
creature
she
cried
again
but
they
were
spiteful
tears
and
did
not
create
in
me
the
least
touch
of
that
pity
which
on
any
other
occasion
they
might
have
moved
me
to
i
was
glad
our
altercations
had
a
short
truce
by
the
chariot
stopping
at
the
gardener
cottage
where
i
had
ordered
my
equipage
to
wait
all
the
family
were
in
bed
but
the
man
wife
who
came
to
the
door
i
led
or
rather
lifted
mrs
gerrarde
out
of
the
chariot
for
she
would
not
give
me
her
hand
and
begging
she
would
repose
herself
for
a
few
minutes
whilst
i
gave
orders
to
my
servants
put
her
into
the
good
woman
hands
she
went
sullenly
in
without
making
me
any
answer
and
seeing
nobody
but
the
old
woman
she
was
convinced
that
complaints
or
an
attempt
to
escape
would
be
equally
fruitless
and
so
prudently
acquiesced
i
soon
dispatched
my
orders
i
made
the
footman
who
came
behind
the
chariot
mount
the
box
and
directed
him
to
drive
to
an
inn
in
the
next
village
to
mrs
gerrarde
house
and
from
thence
to
send
it
home
by
some
one
who
did
not
know
to
whom
he
belonged
i
then
ordered
my
own
equipage
to
the
door
and
entering
the
cottage
told
the
lady
i
was
ready
to
attend
her
the
old
woman
presently
vanished
so
that
seeing
nobody
to
apply
to
she
suffered
me
very
quietly
to
put
her
into
my
chariot
and
i
placed
myself
by
her
it
was
made
on
purpose
for
travelling
and
i
took
care
to
have
nothing
but
wooden
windows
to
which
i
had
the
precaution
to
add
a
couple
of
which
shut
on
drawing
up
and
were
not
without
difficulty
to
be
opened
one
of
the
windows
was
already
up
and
i
flurted
up
the
other
as
soon
as
i
got
into
the
coach
it
was
a
fine
morning
the
postilion
cracked
his
whip
and
though
the
roads
were
deep
and
dirty
the
four
horses
darted
away
like
lightning
i
believe
madam
said
i
you
are
by
this
time
convinced
that
my
scheme
is
too
well
laid
to
be
baffled
by
any
efforts
you
can
make
i
mean
to
treat
you
with
due
respect
and
beg
you
will
use
me
with
a
little
more
gentleness
than
you
have
done
that
is
all
the
favour
i
shall
ask
in
return
till
you
yourself
are
disposed
to
shew
me
more
you
are
the
most
amazing
creature
said
she
that
ever
breathed
what
is
the
meaning
that
in
the
whole
course
of
our
acquaintance
your
behaviour
never
gave
me
room
to
believe
that
you
were
serious
in
your
designs
on
me
and
now
at
once
you
souse
upon
your
prey
like
a
hawk
i
answer
you
in
two
words
said
i
when
we
first
met
you
had
a
husband
since
the
renewal
of
our
acquaintance
you
pardon
me
it
was
no
secret
that
you
had
a
favoured
lover
in
mr
arnold
i
am
not
of
a
temper
to
solicit
a
lady
by
stealth
and
i
would
not
give
a
pinch
of
snuff
for
the
woman
who
is
not
intirely
at
my
disposal
your
attachments
to
arnold
forbad
this
and
i
was
determined
to
have
you
all
to
myself
my
attachments
to
mr
arnold
cried
she
impudently
again
ay
said
i
coolly
it
began
to
be
talked
of
so
openly
that
your
reputation
was
mangled
at
every
in
the
country
and
had
you
staid
much
longer
there
you
would
have
found
yourself
deserted
by
every
female
of
character
that
knew
you
mr
arnold
parting
with
his
wife
was
by
charged
to
your
account
and
as
she
is
reckoned
a
very
of
a
woman
was
not
that
a
pretty
phrase
every
one
took
her
part
and
were
not
sparing
in
their
invectives
against
you
add
to
all
this
that
arnold
has
certainly
run
out
his
fortune
and
is
so
involved
that
it
will
not
be
possible
for
him
long
to
make
those
returns
of
generosity
which
your
merit
you
and
i
have
been
acquainted
long
i
am
no
stranger
to
your
circumstances
i
know
at
captain
gerrarde
death
your
pension
as
his
widow
and
the
very
small
jointure
at
ashby
was
the
whole
of
your
income
arnold
love
it
is
apparent
has
hitherto
been
bountiful
how
long
it
could
be
in
his
power
to
continue
it
so
may
be
a
question
worth
your
considering
i
found
i
had
mortified
her
pride
by
mentioning
the
narrowness
of
her
circumstances
and
the
demolition
of
her
character
if
all
you
say
true
sir
which
is
far
from
being
the
case
with
a
toss
of
her
head
you
will
find
it
no
very
easy
matter
to
make
me
amends
for
what
i
shall
perhaps
lose
for
ever
by
this
violence
of
yours
notwithstanding
the
of
my
income
which
you
seem
so
well
informed
of
i
have
a
considerable
sum
of
money
and
some
valuable
jewels
lying
by
me
of
which
my
servants
may
very
probably
rob
me
i
assured
her
upon
my
honour
i
would
make
good
to
her
every
thing
she
should
lose
through
my
means
and
would
take
care
her
situation
should
never
be
upon
the
same
precarious
footing
which
it
had
been
i
did
not
chuse
to
mention
the
circumstance
of
my
having
secured
her
maid
and
her
money
too
i
reserved
that
for
an
agreeable
surprize
i
had
measures
to
observe
i
did
not
want
to
be
on
good
terms
with
her
too
soon
for
obvious
reasons
as
nothing
was
farther
from
my
heart
than
a
thought
of
gallantry
for
this
purpose
i
assumed
a
more
distant
behaviour
and
affected
to
shew
her
something
like
respect
i
did
not
drop
the
least
hint
of
my
knowing
that
mr
arnold
had
made
his
lady
uneasy
on
my
account
much
less
that
i
suspected
her
for
the
wicked
contriver
of
that
mischief
i
deferred
the
discussing
of
this
point
till
a
more
favourable
opportunity
should
offer
when
it
would
be
in
my
power
to
make
a
better
use
of
it
my
design
was
by
degrees
to
make
her
satisfied
enough
with
her
situation
not
to
wish
to
return
to
arnold
when
i
had
once
brought
her
to
this
i
judged
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
carry
her
still
farther
to
the
point
i
aimed
at
and
that
was
to
write
a
letter
to
him
of
my
dictating
you
will
think
this
was
a
strange
expectation
and
yet
it
was
what
i
resolved
to
accomplish
i
knew
the
turn
of
the
mind
i
had
to
deal
with
bring
a
woman
of
this
sort
into
and
it
is
easy
to
wheedle
her
into
compliance
she
has
no
solid
understanding
but
possesses
in
the
place
of
it
a
sort
of
flashy
wit
that
imposes
on
common
hearers
and
makes
her
pass
for
what
is
called
clever
with
a
great
deal
of
vanity
and
an
affectation
of
tenderness
which
covers
the
most
termagant
spirit
that
ever
animated
a
female
breast
her
ruling
and
governing
passion
is
avarice
and
yet
strange
to
tell
generosity
is
of
all
things
what
she
professes
to
admire
and
is
most
studious
of
having
thought
her
characteristic
her
pretensions
to
this
virtue
i
have
opposed
to
her
vice
of
avarice
as
the
terms
appropriated
to
each
seem
most
contrary
in
their
natures
yet
i
do
not
mean
by
generosity
that
bounteous
disposition
which
is
commonly
understood
by
the
word
no
no
she
aimed
at
the
reputation
of
this
virtue
in
our
most
exalted
idea
of
it
and
would
fain
be
thought
a
woman
of
a
this
phrase
was
often
in
her
mouth
and
though
her
whole
conduct
gave
the
lye
to
her
professions
she
would
tell
you
fifty
stories
without
a
word
of
truth
in
any
of
them
to
prove
how
nobly
she
had
acted
on
such
and
such
occasions
on
the
knowlege
of
this
part
of
her
temper
i
chiefly
built
my
hopes
of
success
i
kept
up
a
sort
of
forced
conversation
during
the
rest
of
our
journey
she
was
sullen
but
not
rude
as
i
was
far
from
desiring
to
come
to
an
eclaircissement
with
her
i
did
not
wish
to
have
her
in
better
temper
we
reached
the
inn
which
was
about
a
mile
on
our
side
of
rochester
at
eight
in
the
morning
this
was
a
favourable
hour
as
by
that
time
every
traveller
must
have
left
the
stages
they
lay
at
the
house
stood
alone
and
luckily
enough
had
no
company
in
it
my
old
servant
lamb
had
received
my
instructions
by
letter
and
was
prepared
accordingly
for
our
reception
this
was
the
place
to
which
i
had
ordered
the
maid
to
be
carried
she
had
arrived
there
some
time
before
us
and
was
safely
lodged
the
chariot
drove
into
the
close
to
the
door
of
the
inn
the
step
was
let
down
in
an
instant
and
mrs
lamb
appeared
to
receive
us
we
both
darted
into
the
house
dressed
as
we
were
for
a
ball
we
made
an
odd
appearance
as
travellers
at
that
hour
of
the
morning
i
believe
this
consideration
made
mrs
gerrarde
very
readily
hurry
upstairs
with
the
woman
of
the
house
i
enquired
for
mrs
gerrarde
maid
having
given
orders
to
lamb
that
she
should
not
been
seen
till
i
first
spoke
to
her
i
was
carried
into
the
room
where
she
was
she
seemed
very
glad
that
we
were
arrived
i
desired
her
to
lay
out
her
lady
toilet
which
i
concluded
she
had
brought
with
her
for
that
mrs
gerrarde
would
presently
put
herself
in
a
proper
habit
for
travelling
the
maid
told
me
she
had
brought
her
with
her
and
as
many
other
things
of
her
wearing
apparel
as
she
could
conveniently
carry
i
saw
a
vast
heap
of
things
lying
unpacked
on
a
bed
which
was
in
the
room
and
asked
her
how
she
had
managed
so
cleverly
as
to
get
such
a
number
of
things
together
without
observation
she
told
me
she
had
lost
no
time
from
the
minute
i
left
her
till
the
arrival
of
her
guide
but
had
employed
the
interval
in
carrying
out
some
of
the
best
of
her
lady
cloaths
piece
by
piece
and
conveying
them
to
the
cottage
which
she
could
easily
do
without
the
servants
seeing
her
for
as
it
was
dark
she
passed
in
and
out
without
observation
here
she
huddled
them
into
a
large
portmanteau
after
this
she
went
to
examine
her
lady
escruitore
but
was
a
long
time
puzzled
in
endeavouring
to
open
it
as
none
of
the
keys
i
had
given
her
answered
she
endeavoured
to
force
it
open
with
as
little
noise
as
possible
but
in
vain
she
then
had
recourse
to
a
second
trial
of
the
keys
when
one
of
them
which
probably
had
been
passed
by
before
luckily
opened
the
lock
and
she
secured
all
the
money
and
jewels
she
could
find
these
said
she
kept
me
in
continual
dread
all
the
way
as
i
travelled
for
i
have
eight
hundred
pounds
in
bank
notes
and
though
my
lady
has
such
a
quantity
of
jewels
on
her
i
am
sure
i
have
as
many
more
about
me
which
i
have
hid
in
different
parts
of
my
cloaths
i
commended
the
girl
diligence
as
indeed
it
deserved
and
having
before
ordered
tea
and
coffee
into
mrs
gerrarde
room
i
now
went
in
to
breakfast
with
her
i
found
the
woman
of
the
house
still
with
her
at
which
i
was
not
at
all
uneasy
for
as
she
had
been
tutored
by
her
husband
i
knew
she
was
not
to
be
wrought
upon
if
mrs
gerrarde
had
attempted
it
as
i
did
not
at
that
time
desire
a
à
with
her
i
contrived
to
keep
mrs
lamb
in
the
room
by
desiring
her
to
drink
tea
with
us
when
we
had
done
breakfast
i
told
mrs
gerrarde
that
as
i
feared
she
was
a
good
deal
fatigued
if
it
was
agreeable
to
her
we
would
remain
where
we
were
for
that
day
and
that
i
would
by
all
means
have
her
think
of
taking
some
rest
she
said
she
was
extremely
tired
and
should
like
to
get
a
little
sleep
i
think
madam
you
had
better
go
to
bed
said
mrs
lamb
i
have
a
very
quiet
chamber
ready
where
no
noise
in
the
house
can
disturb
you
shew
me
to
it
answered
mrs
gerrarde
with
a
tone
of
weariness
and
the
woman
obeyed
i
followed
she
carried
her
to
the
door
of
the
room
where
the
maid
was
and
throwing
it
open
mrs
gerrarde
who
supposed
she
was
attending
her
went
in
i
stepped
in
after
her
mrs
lamb
withdrew
mrs
gerrarde
astonishment
at
the
sight
of
her
maid
is
past
description
rachael
in
a
tone
of
admiration
rachael
who
did
not
think
there
was
any
thing
unexpected
or
extraordinary
in
their
meeting
quite
at
a
loss
to
guess
at
what
her
mistress
wondered
answered
her
in
her
turn
with
some
surprize
madam
and
waited
expecting
she
would
give
her
some
orders
which
finding
the
lady
did
not
the
maid
asked
her
very
composedly
would
she
please
to
undress
i
hope
madam
said
i
stepping
forward
that
mrs
rachael
has
taken
care
to
bring
you
every
thing
you
may
have
occasion
for
i
shall
leave
you
in
her
hands
and
wish
you
a
good
repose
strange
astonishing
creature
said
mrs
gerrarde
looking
at
me
with
less
anger
than
surprize
i
bowed
and
left
the
room
i
ordered
mrs
lamb
to
have
an
eye
to
my
prisoners
and
heartily
tired
as
i
was
between
dancing
and
travelling
i
undressed
and
threw
myself
into
bed
i
slept
till
six
in
the
evening
then
rose
and
put
myself
into
a
habit
fitter
for
my
journey
than
that
in
which
i
came
and
which
i
had
sent
in
a
before
me
by
the
messenger
whom
i
had
employed
to
apprize
lamb
of
my
coming
mrs
gerrarde
was
not
yet
stirring
i
called
for
rachael
and
asked
her
how
she
had
come
off
with
her
lady
upon
telling
her
the
manner
of
her
falling
into
my
snare
rachael
told
me
her
lady
wondered
mightily
at
my
art
and
said
i
was
the
that
ever
was
born
my
friend
rachael
softened
the
expression
i
fancy
i
am
sure
mrs
gerrarde
did
not
call
me
a
strange
she
said
her
mistress
smiled
two
or
three
times
at
her
relation
particularly
at
my
giving
her
the
keys
i
found
upon
the
whole
that
my
conduct
in
securing
to
her
her
money
and
her
jewels
together
with
the
attendance
of
her
maid
had
a
good
deal
appeased
her
resentment
mrs
gerrarde
did
not
rise
till
near
eight
i
had
ordered
as
elegant
a
dinner
as
the
house
could
afford
and
the
lady
having
put
herself
into
a
genteel
dishabille
with
great
alacrity
sat
down
to
table
and
did
not
appear
to
have
fretted
away
her
appetite
i
would
suffer
no
one
to
attend
but
rachael
i
told
mrs
gerrarde
that
i
purposed
setting
out
for
dover
that
night
and
that
as
it
could
not
be
supposed
her
maid
should
be
able
to
ride
so
far
and
that
a
second
carriage
with
four
horses
as
less
might
not
be
able
to
keep
pace
with
us
would
be
liable
to
observation
i
would
if
she
pleased
resign
my
place
in
the
chariot
to
mrs
rachael
and
attend
her
myself
on
horseback
she
answered
me
coldly
since
she
go
it
was
indifferent
to
her
who
was
to
be
her
companion
though
the
motive
i
offered
for
this
manner
of
travelling
was
not
without
its
weight
yet
my
true
reason
was
to
avoid
being
boxed
up
so
long
again
with
mrs
gerrarde
my
time
was
not
yet
come
for
explanations
and
i
was
afraid
of
being
upon
good
terms
with
her
too
soon
the
remainder
of
the
evening
was
spent
by
her
and
her
maid
in
carefully
packing
up
their
baggage
which
had
been
brought
in
a
confused
huddle
to
the
inn
mrs
gerrarde
had
a
convenient
trunk
bought
at
rochester
for
the
purpose
and
assisted
herself
in
laying
them
up
safely
she
equipped
herself
in
a
smart
and
at
eleven
without
any
great
reluctance
permitted
me
to
put
her
and
her
maid
into
the
chariot
the
inn
had
no
company
in
it
at
least
that
we
saw
and
our
host
was
too
discreet
to
let
any
of
his
servants
be
in
the
way
i
mounted
my
horse
and
triumphantly
galloped
off
with
my
prize
we
reached
dover
early
next
morning
and
immediately
got
on
board
the
packet
the
lady
by
this
time
appeared
so
perfectly
serene
that
i
believe
in
my
soul
i
should
not
have
got
rid
of
her
if
i
had
desired
her
to
have
gone
back
again
but
she
had
assumed
a
new
air
and
affected
a
fine
tender
melancholy
in
her
countenance
i
guessed
at
her
thoughts
and
found
afterwards
my
conjecture
right
will
you
believe
me
sir
george
when
i
tell
you
the
baggage
had
formed
serious
upon
my
person
fact
upon
my
word
i
saw
it
presently
you
know
my
knack
of
reading
people
minds
in
their
faces
and
was
not
sorry
for
the
discovery
for
though
i
determined
not
on
any
account
to
encourage
such
a
wild
expectation
yet
i
intended
to
make
a
use
of
it
besides
i
knew
it
would
afford
me
a
handle
for
keeping
a
distance
we
landed
next
evening
she
had
been
very
sick
at
sea
and
continued
so
much
out
of
order
that
she
was
put
to
bed
as
soon
as
we
got
to
the
inn
she
ordered
her
maid
not
to
stir
from
her
the
very
thing
i
wished
so
that
i
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
be
very
troublesome
in
my
enquiries
after
her
health
and
very
sorry
for
her
indisposition
the
next
morning
however
set
all
to
rights
and
after
congratulating
her
on
her
recovery
and
the
revival
of
her
beauty
i
told
her
i
meant
to
carry
her
to
boulogne
whither
i
had
sent
pivet
the
night
before
to
take
lodgings
for
us
in
a
private
house
which
he
knew
i
found
that
neither
mrs
gerrarde
nor
her
maid
spoke
french
a
circumstance
i
was
very
glad
of
though
the
former
bitterly
lamented
her
having
it
she
made
not
the
least
objection
to
the
travelling
from
calais
to
boulogne
as
she
had
done
before
her
late
indisposition
gave
me
a
pretence
for
insisting
on
rachael
attending
her
in
the
chariot
the
lodgings
pivet
had
taken
were
very
handsome
our
apartments
were
on
the
same
floor
separated
only
by
a
lobby
mrs
rachael
had
a
little
bed
fitted
up
for
her
by
my
directions
in
her
lady
thus
far
i
had
sailed
before
the
wind
but
now
came
the
difficult
part
of
my
task
it
was
impossible
for
mrs
gerrarde
to
conceive
that
any
thing
but
love
for
her
person
could
have
induced
me
to
do
what
i
had
done
i
had
actually
run
away
with
her
put
myself
to
some
hazard
and
what
in
her
estimation
was
no
small
matter
some
expence
too
no
other
motive
had
appeared
in
all
my
conduct
towards
her
and
tho
i
had
not
absolutely
made
love
to
her
yet
what
other
construction
could
my
actions
bear
for
my
words
to
say
the
truth
were
equivocal
she
must
necessarily
have
concluded
that
i
had
no
other
view
but
a
piece
of
gallantry
with
her
her
designs
on
me
were
of
a
much
more
serious
nature
and
her
vanity
made
her
imagine
that
notwithstanding
my
thorough
knowledge
of
her
character
her
cunning
joined
to
my
passion
might
lead
me
into
her
snare
now
i
had
two
nice
points
to
consider
of
and
two
difficulties
to
surmount
the
first
was
not
by
any
part
of
my
conduct
to
carry
the
deception
so
far
as
to
give
her
the
least
room
to
hope
i
could
be
mad
enough
to
marry
her
this
bad
as
is
and
extravagant
as
am
i
could
not
think
of
doing
even
to
gain
my
favourite
point
the
other
was
to
keep
up
such
an
appearance
of
gallantry
towards
her
as
she
must
naturally
expect
and
at
the
same
time
avoid
all
approaches
which
usually
forerun
the
catastrophe
of
an
amour
than
which
nothing
was
more
repugnant
to
my
wishes
to
steer
between
these
two
extremes
was
the
difficult
task
particularly
the
latter
for
between
ourselves
i
began
to
be
much
more
afraid
of
her
than
she
was
of
me
i
knew
it
would
be
impossible
for
me
to
keep
up
the
farce
long
the
sooner
it
was
over
the
better
and
therefore
i
determined
to
enter
on
my
part
directly
i
had
been
ruminating
on
my
project
all
the
way
as
i
rode
when
we
arrived
at
boulogne
i
found
myself
a
little
out
of
order
having
caught
cold
and
as
i
was
really
somewhat
feverish
a
thought
started
into
my
head
that
this
illness
might
aid
me
in
my
design
when
we
came
to
our
lodgings
i
made
my
excuses
to
mrs
gerrarde
for
not
being
able
to
attend
her
i
told
her
i
found
myself
ill
and
must
be
obliged
to
go
to
bed
she
said
she
was
and
perhaps
she
spoke
truth
i
left
her
in
possession
of
her
new
apartment
with
her
maid
rachael
their
being
strangers
to
the
language
of
the
country
cut
off
all
communication
with
the
people
of
the
house
who
could
not
speak
english
i
introduced
pivet
to
them
whom
they
had
never
seen
before
for
he
had
taken
particular
care
to
keep
out
of
their
view
during
the
whole
journey
as
a
gentleman
who
was
to
be
their
interpreter
and
having
thus
settled
my
household
i
retired
to
my
not
well
nor
sick
enough
to
go
to
bed
i
threw
myself
however
down
on
it
and
after
revolving
in
my
mind
all
the
occurrences
of
the
three
or
four
past
days
i
started
up
again
sat
down
to
my
desk
and
have
given
you
my
bidulph
a
faithful
narrative
of
my
proceedings
down
to
the
present
period
of
time
being
november
eight
in
the
evening
you
may
soon
expect
to
have
the
second
part
of
this
my
delectable
history
how
orlando
not
being
able
to
prevail
with
all
his
eloquence
on
the
as
fair
and
beautiful
as
fierce
and
inexorable
princess
gerrardina
to
put
the
finishing
hand
to
his
adventures
and
most
wonderful
exploits
did
his
wrath
being
moved
thereby
like
an
ungentle
knight
bury
his
sword
in
her
but
savage
and
unrelenting
breast
whereat
being
stung
with
remorse
he
afterwards
kills
himself
would
not
this
be
a
pretty
conclusion
of
my
adventures
no
no
sir
george
expect
better
things
from
thy
friend
i
hope
my
will
not
end
so
tragically
but
hasten
to
make
my
peace
with
that
gracious
creature
your
sister
yet
why
do
i
name
her
and
myself
in
the
same
sentence
she
cares
not
for
me
thinks
not
of
me
or
if
she
does
it
is
with
contempt
i
said
this
before
and
i
repeat
it
again
but
tell
her
what
i
have
done
was
with
a
view
to
promote
her
happiness
oh
may
be
happy
whatever
becomes
of
me
i
know
the
means
i
have
used
will
make
her
angry
but
try
to
make
her
forgive
the
means
for
the
motive
sake
tell
her
as
much
of
this
wild
story
as
you
think
proper
but
do
not
let
her
see
it
in
my
wild
rambling
language
that
is
only
fit
for
your
own
eye
your
mother
i
know
is
out
of
all
patience
with
me
i
am
black
enough
in
her
opinion
already
this
last
action
as
far
as
she
has
yet
known
of
it
will
dye
me
ten
shades
deeper
but
pray
put
in
a
word
for
me
there
too
i
know
she
will
say
that
are
not
to
return
evil
for
evil
and
that
it
is
not
lawful
to
do
evil
though
to
bring
forth
good
but
put
her
in
mind
that
there
are
such
things
as
though
i
do
not
take
this
of
mine
to
be
one
of
them
wicked
people
are
to
have
their
arts
opposed
by
and
that
good
people
have
not
only
been
permitted
but
commanded
to
execute
vengeance
on
sinners
and
you
may
hint
at
the
children
of
israel
being
ordered
to
spoil
the
ægyptians
though
far
be
it
from
me
to
spoil
mrs
gerrarde
of
any
thing
she
has
this
however
and
as
many
wise
sayings
as
you
can
collect
for
the
purpose
you
may
string
together
and
be
sure
you
tell
her
i
have
hopes
of
reclaiming
mrs
gerrarde
from
her
courses
and
do
not
despair
of
prevailing
on
her
to
go
into
a
nunnery
for
mrs
gerrarde
you
must
know
was
bred
a
roman
catholic
though
she
conformed
on
marrying
captain
gerrarde
now
put
all
this
into
decent
language
fit
for
that
very
good
ears
for
i
must
call
her
notwithstanding
she
was
inexorable
to
me
i
am
fatigued
with
writing
so
long
a
letter
i
feel
my
disorder
increase
upon
me
i
will
be
let
blood
and
hope
soon
to
give
you
a
good
account
of
my
undertaking
mean
while
if
i
am
not
quite
reprobated
write
me
a
line
directed
under
cover
to
monsieur
larou
at
the
boulogne
farewel
my
dear
bidulph
sick
or
well
i
am
ever
your
was
there
ever
such
a
piece
of
what
a
is
this
pray
my
dear
are
you
not
astonished
at
him
i
am
sure
i
am
i
had
not
an
opportunity
to
finish
the
copying
of
this
very
long
letter
which
i
began
yesterday
morning
till
very
late
this
night
my
poor
mother
has
been
so
restless
and
so
much
out
of
order
these
two
days
i
desired
her
leave
to
read
to
her
mr
faulkland
history
for
i
can
call
it
by
no
other
name
as
i
sat
by
her
she
told
me
i
might
let
her
know
the
substance
of
what
he
said
as
it
would
fatigue
her
too
much
to
attend
to
so
long
an
epistle
you
would
have
smiled
my
cecilia
at
my
good
parent
amazement
when
i
told
her
mr
faulkland
proceedings
and
his
reasons
for
them
she
would
scarce
give
credit
to
it
at
first
and
i
was
obliged
to
repeat
several
circumstances
to
her
over
again
and
so
said
she
this
was
all
on
account
and
he
had
no
ill
design
on
mrs
gerrarde
i
am
glad
of
this
for
miss
burchell
sake
and
shall
be
impatient
to
tell
her
of
it
i
begged
of
my
mother
to
wait
a
while
for
the
result
of
mr
faulkland
adventure
before
she
mentioned
any
thing
of
the
matter
to
miss
burchell
we
do
not
yet
know
said
i
how
this
matter
may
turn
out
mr
faulkland
to
be
sure
will
make
haste
to
communicate
to
my
brother
the
issue
of
this
odd
affair
and
it
will
then
be
time
enough
to
inform
the
young
lady
my
mother
unwillingly
consented
to
postpone
a
discovery
which
she
knew
would
be
so
agreeable
to
miss
burchell
i
applaud
her
humanity
but
think
that
good
and
prudent
as
she
is
she
is
too
unreserved
in
her
confidences
this
strange
business
is
i
think
at
present
in
too
critical
a
suspence
to
trust
the
knowledge
of
it
to
anybody
if
mr
faulkland
fails
in
his
design
his
avowal
of
it
will
be
far
from
serving
me
sir
george
was
with
us
for
a
few
minutes
only
to
exult
in
mr
faulkland
recovered
credit
has
he
not
well
explained
himself
said
he
oh
i
knew
there
must
have
been
some
mystery
at
the
bottom
of
that
conduct
which
surprized
us
all
so
much
a
man
for
you
shew
me
another
who
would
carry
his
noble
disinterested
love
to
such
lengths
my
mother
did
not
like
that
he
should
run
on
in
that
strain
and
therefore
stopped
him
the
end
crowns
all
sir
george
let
us
see
how
your
friend
will
conduct
himself
this
ticklish
affair
let
him
get
through
it
how
he
will
answered
my
brother
a
little
bluntly
i
think
sidney
has
obligations
to
him
she
ought
never
to
forget
more
intelligence
my
dear
stranger
and
stranger
still
i
am
sorry
i
sent
off
my
last
packet
as
i
am
sure
you
must
be
impatient
for
the
conclusion
of
mr
faulkland
adventure
and
then
what
sorry
stuff
has
the
interval
been
filled
up
with
but
i
will
now
make
you
amends
my
mother
is
better
too
thank
god
and
every
thing
promises
well
sir
george
has
had
a
second
packet
from
boulogne
take
the
continuation
of
mrs
gerrarde
history
as
follows
how
rude
is
the
hand
of
sickness
my
bidulph
it
had
like
to
have
spoiled
one
of
the
best
projects
that
ever
was
undertaken
and
consigned
to
oblivion
an
action
worthy
of
immortality
i
have
been
very
ill
since
i
last
wrote
to
you
the
disorder
which
i
then
complained
of
turned
out
to
be
an
ugly
fever
and
i
was
for
three
days
in
extreme
danger
mrs
gerrarde
was
during
that
time
closely
attended
by
pivet
whose
services
i
dispensed
with
on
that
account
he
told
me
she
appeared
uneasy
at
my
situation
and
enquired
constantly
and
too
after
my
health
when
i
grew
well
enough
to
sit
up
i
begged
the
favour
of
seeing
her
in
my
chamber
she
came
very
readily
and
seemed
downright
anxious
for
my
recovery
i
told
her
i
hoped
she
had
been
treated
with
proper
care
and
respect
during
my
sickness
she
said
mr
pivet
was
a
very
obliging
man
and
had
endeavoured
to
make
her
confinement
as
easy
to
her
as
possible
the
plan
she
had
formed
of
turning
to
the
most
lasting
advantage
the
inclination
she
supposed
i
had
for
her
inclined
her
to
assume
a
very
different
behaviour
from
what
was
natural
to
her
the
weakness
of
my
condition
while
it
afforded
me
a
pretence
for
a
more
cold
and
languid
behaviour
than
i
could
with
any
colour
have
put
on
at
another
time
gave
her
an
opportunity
of
playing
off
her
arts
and
facilitated
my
design
beyond
my
hopes
she
was
seated
at
my
our
first
conversation
consisted
of
nothing
but
complaints
on
my
side
and
condolements
on
her
i
sighed
several
times
and
she
sighed
in
return
mrs
gerrarde
said
i
you
are
afflicted
but
my
illness
has
no
share
in
your
concern
something
else
oppresses
you
you
regret
the
being
separated
from
mr
arnold
and
i
am
always
the
object
of
your
hatred
neither
one
nor
answered
she
in
a
kind
voice
is
impossible
to
hate
you
you
know
it
is
not
in
nature
for
a
to
hate
such
a
man
as
mr
faulkland
as
for
mr
arnold
though
i
my
former
weakness
in
regard
to
him
yet
i
hope
i
have
something
to
plead
in
my
excuse
i
was
married
very
early
to
an
old
man
and
had
never
experienced
the
happiness
of
reciprocal
love
he
died
and
left
me
destitute
mr
arnold
generous
though
i
must
confess
unwarrantable
passion
rescued
me
from
distress
i
did
not
know
he
was
married
when
i
first
unwarily
accepted
of
his
addresses
and
it
was
too
late
to
retreat
before
i
found
it
out
otherwise
the
universe
should
not
have
tempted
me
to
have
listened
to
him
in
the
midst
of
the
affluence
i
obtained
from
him
it
often
grieved
me
to
think
of
the
injury
i
did
his
wife
there
is
nothing
mr
faulkland
so
grating
to
a
generous
mind
and
i
think
i
may
venture
to
assert
that
is
one
as
to
live
in
a
state
of
dependence
and
at
the
same
time
owe
that
very
dependence
to
a
vice
that
you
disdain
i
was
delighted
to
find
that
she
had
got
into
this
strain
it
was
the
thing
i
wished
but
durst
hardly
hope
for
without
abundance
of
trouble
on
my
part
and
a
dissimulation
that
was
irksome
to
me
i
knew
she
had
studied
this
speech
and
got
it
by
rote
to
answer
her
own
purpose
but
in
this
as
is
generally
the
case
of
designing
people
she
overshot
herself
and
became
the
dupe
to
her
own
artifice
i
laid
hold
of
the
cue
she
gave
oh
madam
you
charm
me
go
on
go
on
now
indeed
you
shew
a
generous
mind
happy
would
it
be
for
all
your
sex
after
having
deviated
from
the
paths
of
virtue
if
they
could
return
to
them
with
so
good
a
grace
so
just
a
sense
of
their
errors
to
sir
said
she
with
a
solemn
air
i
am
indebted
for
my
present
resolutions
i
hope
from
this
time
forward
that
my
life
will
be
irreproachable
hope
so
too
madam
i
guessed
she
understood
these
words
as
favouring
her
design
it
was
not
meet
to
undeceive
her
a
little
mental
reservation
you
know
bidulph
she
went
on
little
thinking
she
was
forwarding
plan
when
she
only
meant
to
promote
her
i
hope
mr
arnold
will
be
as
sensible
of
his
fault
as
i
am
of
and
that
he
will
never
fall
into
the
like
indiscretion
again
i
believe
there
can
be
no
true
happiness
but
between
a
pair
who
sincerely
love
each
other
good
good
thought
i
sure
my
better
genius
prompts
the
woman
to
speak
thus
ah
mrs
gerrarde
how
exactly
do
your
thoughts
correspond
with
mine
how
just
are
all
your
sentiments
what
a
true
relish
have
you
for
virtue
yes
i
hope
with
you
that
mr
arnold
will
be
able
to
tread
in
your
steps
it
is
a
pity
he
has
not
your
noble
example
before
him
mrs
arnold
is
a
good
woman
and
he
might
still
live
with
her
in
tolerable
contentment
if
he
can
get
the
better
of
his
irregular
passion
for
you
what
a
noble
triumph
of
virtuous
resolution
would
this
be
if
you
yourself
were
the
instrument
to
bring
this
about
for
mrs
arnold
and
her
brother
sake
as
well
as
your
own
i
wish
this
were
feasible
i
would
do
any
thing
in
my
power
said
she
thinking
she
obliged
me
by
the
declaration
but
i
know
not
by
what
means
such
an
event
can
be
brought
to
pass
i
was
afraid
to
urge
the
matter
farther
i
was
within
an
breadth
of
gaining
my
point
but
did
not
think
it
prudent
to
press
too
forward
we
think
of
it
another
time
said
i
and
groaned
heavily
as
if
my
spirits
were
fatigued
with
talking
she
took
the
hint
i
am
afraid
i
have
tired
you
you
have
talked
too
much
i
answered
her
faintly
you
are
very
good
she
curtesied
to
me
and
retired
with
a
majestic
step
i
saw
her
no
more
that
day
she
had
got
upon
stilts
and
it
was
not
yet
time
to
take
her
down
may
produce
a
wonder
i
will
wait
for
it
i
am
really
weak
but
begin
to
recover
my
spirits
december
nothing
is
so
conducive
to
the
body
health
as
the
mind
being
at
ease
i
have
proved
the
truth
of
this
observation
my
soul
had
been
racked
with
suspence
and
uncertainty
during
my
illness
the
uneasy
state
of
my
mind
increased
my
disorder
the
disorder
itself
had
chiefly
given
rise
to
my
apprehensions
as
pain
and
sickness
are
naturally
accompanied
with
a
gloominess
of
thought
thus
the
cause
and
its
effects
were
united
in
mutual
league
against
me
and
reciprocally
assisted
each
other
to
plague
and
torment
me
my
fears
were
intirely
on
mrs
arnold
account
what
thought
i
would
be
the
consequence
of
my
project
in
case
of
my
death
mrs
gerrarde
will
return
back
to
england
and
upon
telling
her
story
will
be
received
again
by
arnold
their
union
perhaps
established
as
firmly
as
before
and
poor
mrs
arnold
hopes
ruined
for
ever
then
i
thought
what
a
wretch
i
must
appear
in
her
eyes
doubtful
may
be
of
my
sincerity
as
to
the
motives
i
urged
to
you
for
my
conduct
on
the
other
hand
if
these
motives
should
by
any
means
happen
to
be
suspected
by
mrs
gerrarde
it
might
be
the
means
of
producing
the
direct
contrary
effect
from
what
i
intended
and
instead
of
banishing
arnold
cruel
suspicions
of
his
lady
only
serve
to
strengthen
them
for
i
knew
mrs
gerrarde
would
leave
nothing
unsaid
or
undone
for
this
horrid
purpose
and
it
is
not
every
one
sir
george
whose
hearts
are
enlarged
enough
to
suppose
a
man
may
now
and
then
take
a
little
pains
from
disinterested
principles
this
last
suggestion
of
my
thoughts
made
me
almost
mad
and
actually
brought
on
a
delirium
and
what
may
seem
a
paradox
though
it
is
literally
true
the
total
deprivation
of
my
senses
for
two
days
was
the
means
of
my
recovering
them
afterwards
for
i
am
sure
had
i
retained
enough
of
them
to
have
ruminated
longer
on
this
fatal
supposition
and
my
disorder
had
still
threatened
me
with
death
i
should
have
run
mad
the
care
of
a
skilful
physician
recalled
me
from
the
precincts
of
the
grave
the
strength
of
a
constitution
naturally
good
joined
to
all
the
resolution
i
could
muster
did
the
rest
the
first
use
i
made
of
my
recovered
reason
was
to
consult
with
myself
in
what
manner
or
by
what
means
i
should
prevail
on
mrs
gerrarde
to
lend
a
helping
hand
to
my
design
her
leaving
arnold
to
go
off
with
me
and
to
all
human
appearance
with
her
own
consent
was
a
material
point
gained
but
the
most
important
of
all
and
without
which
every
thing
else
would
be
fruitless
was
to
get
her
to
acknowlege
under
her
own
hand
the
injury
she
had
done
mrs
arnold
by
her
vile
insinuations
to
her
husband
this
was
the
grand
object
of
all
my
wishes
this
you
will
say
was
difficult
i
confess
it
did
then
appear
so
to
me
i
had
not
at
first
weighed
all
the
consequences
of
my
enterprize
with
that
deliberation
that
i
ought
the
principal
object
i
had
in
view
was
the
separating
mrs
gerrarde
and
mr
arnold
and
raising
his
indignation
against
her
on
account
of
the
apparent
infidelity
on
her
side
to
say
the
truth
i
had
not
considered
what
i
was
to
do
with
her
when
i
had
her
two
things
i
had
resolved
on
the
one
was
not
to
let
her
return
to
england
the
other
to
provide
for
her
in
whatever
way
she
would
put
it
in
my
power
the
devoting
myself
to
her
excepted
in
such
a
manner
as
should
leave
her
no
room
to
reproach
me
with
having
injured
her
temporal
welfare
during
my
illness
i
had
resolved
all
these
things
in
my
mind
the
last
viz
the
providing
for
mrs
gerrarde
was
not
a
matter
in
which
i
expected
to
meet
many
difficulties
the
other
appeared
very
formidable
several
methods
presented
themselves
but
none
of
them
pleased
me
and
i
rejected
them
one
after
the
other
and
to
tell
you
my
mind
honestly
i
was
almost
resolved
on
using
compulsion
and
frightening
the
poor
woman
into
compliance
for
i
preferred
even
this
to
artificial
dealings
i
had
already
used
more
than
i
could
have
possibly
brought
myself
to
on
any
other
occasion
in
the
world
and
i
think
i
should
have
threatened
her
with
a
nunnery
the
bastile
or
even
an
inquisition
sooner
than
have
failed
if
she
herself
had
not
beyond
expectation
beyond
hope
almost
beyond
the
evidence
of
my
senses
led
me
as
it
were
to
request
the
thing
of
her
which
of
all
others
i
most
despaired
of
her
consenting
to
or
even
hearing
proposed
with
patience
and
yet
notwithstanding
the
seeming
strangeness
of
this
it
was
nothing
but
what
was
very
natural
and
most
consonant
to
her
own
designs
blinded
and
as
i
may
say
infatuated
by
vanity
she
imagined
that
as
i
had
taken
such
uncommon
pains
to
obtain
her
i
must
love
her
with
an
uncommon
degree
of
passion
and
that
her
steadily
refusing
any
dishonourable
proposals
might
induce
me
rather
than
lose
her
to
make
her
my
wife
in
order
to
prepare
me
the
better
for
this
no
means
were
more
natural
than
for
her
to
assume
the
air
of
a
penitent
to
seem
sorry
and
ashamed
of
her
past
sins
and
resolve
on
a
virtuous
course
for
the
future
at
the
worst
that
is
if
she
found
was
not
disposed
to
be
as
virtuous
as
herself
she
knew
she
might
play
an
and
could
easily
relax
by
degrees
from
the
severity
of
her
chastity
accordingly
as
i
made
it
worth
her
while
this
was
the
to
her
behaviour
and
once
i
had
got
it
which
i
soon
did
it
was
easy
to
unlock
her
breast
she
came
into
my
room
the
next
morning
without
an
invitation
and
only
the
previous
ceremony
of
sending
rachael
to
enquire
how
i
did
and
to
tell
me
if
i
were
well
enough
to
observe
her
nicety
she
would
sit
half
an
hour
with
me
i
had
enjoyed
such
tranquility
of
heart
since
my
last
conference
with
her
and
had
rested
so
well
the
preceding
night
that
i
found
myself
quite
another
thing
from
what
i
was
the
day
before
and
excepting
a
little
weakness
i
was
as
well
as
ever
i
was
in
my
life
i
was
up
and
dressed
and
you
may
be
sure
sent
a
suitable
answer
to
her
kind
message
which
soon
brought
the
lady
sailing
with
an
imperial
port
into
my
chamber
after
some
civilities
past
on
both
sides
she
by
way
of
bringing
her
own
interests
on
the
tapis
the
topic
of
our
yesterday
conversation
you
ca
imagine
mr
faulkland
said
she
how
easy
i
am
in
my
mind
since
i
have
reconciled
myself
to
the
loss
of
mr
arnold
i
own
i
had
a
regard
for
him
but
i
think
it
had
more
of
gratitude
than
love
in
it
for
though
he
is
an
agreeable
man
to
say
the
truth
he
never
was
quite
to
my
taste
he
always
had
something
too
formal
about
him
i
took
the
liberty
to
ask
her
how
she
first
came
acquainted
with
mr
arnold
and
as
you
may
not
know
it
i
will
give
you
the
story
she
answered
with
a
profound
sigh
it
was
by
mere
accident
i
first
saw
him
after
the
death
of
captain
gerrarde
which
happened
in
a
little
more
than
a
year
after
we
left
bath
for
the
gout
poor
man
got
into
his
stomach
not
long
after
we
returned
home
and
the
crocodile
pretended
to
drop
a
tear
i
went
to
london
in
order
to
sollicit
for
my
pension
as
i
had
formerly
been
a
roman
catholic
and
had
not
publickly
renounced
that
persuasion
some
difficulties
arose
in
the
business
and
a
friend
of
my
deceased
husband
who
had
undertaken
the
affair
for
me
happening
to
be
an
intimate
of
mr
arnold
and
knowing
he
had
an
influence
with
the
secretary
at
war
endeavoured
to
interest
him
in
my
favour
by
representing
my
situation
in
the
most
affecting
light
he
could
to
him
he
kindly
undertook
to
interfere
for
me
and
was
as
good
as
his
word
but
could
not
surmount
the
difficulty
of
the
objection
which
was
made
to
my
claim
he
happened
one
morning
unluckily
for
me
to
call
in
at
my
lodgings
to
tell
him
of
his
ill
success
i
impatient
to
know
how
my
affair
went
on
had
dropped
in
to
inquire
about
it
a
few
minutes
before
him
and
was
sitting
in
the
when
mr
arnold
entered
i
was
in
my
weeds
and
my
melancholy
looks
i
believe
made
mr
arnold
conjecture
i
was
the
person
for
whom
he
had
so
kindly
concerned
himself
he
told
my
friend
he
was
sorry
to
inform
him
that
though
he
had
used
all
means
in
his
power
with
regard
to
the
affair
in
which
he
had
employed
him
he
found
it
was
impossible
to
effect
the
business
and
i
am
the
more
concerned
said
he
turning
towards
me
as
i
am
afraid
this
lady
is
to
be
the
sufferer
my
relation
said
i
was
the
person
for
whom
he
had
been
so
good
as
to
intercede
i
returned
mr
arnold
thanks
not
without
tears
at
the
uncomfortable
prospect
i
had
before
me
for
i
had
then
nothing
to
depend
on
but
my
small
jointure
in
kent
i
was
about
to
take
my
leave
but
observing
it
rained
desired
my
friend
to
give
his
servant
leave
to
call
me
a
chair
mr
arnold
very
politely
desired
i
would
permit
him
to
set
me
down
as
his
chariot
waited
at
the
door
i
would
have
excused
myself
but
my
relation
said
is
in
his
way
child
and
since
you
have
no
hopes
of
a
pension
you
ought
to
be
sparing
of
mr
arnold
very
obligingly
offered
me
his
hand
and
led
me
to
his
chariot
he
set
me
down
at
my
lodgings
and
at
parting
desired
permission
to
wait
on
me
the
fatal
consequence
of
our
acquaintance
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
foresee
for
i
never
had
the
least
hint
given
me
either
from
my
own
relation
or
mr
arnold
himself
that
he
was
a
married
man
till
he
had
so
far
secured
my
gratitude
by
repeated
acts
of
generosity
that
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
refuse
him
the
return
he
demanded
heart
said
i
pretending
to
believe
her
cant
what
a
pity
thou
wert
not
destined
to
reward
a
purer
love
but
i
thought
madam
you
really
had
enjoyed
a
pension
it
was
not
necessary
she
answered
that
i
should
let
the
world
suppose
otherwise
i
was
not
at
all
known
when
i
first
came
to
town
mr
arnold
excessive
profuseness
quiet
against
my
inclination
threw
me
into
a
more
expensive
way
of
living
than
before
i
found
myself
obliged
to
account
for
it
to
the
few
acquaintance
i
had
by
all
the
probable
means
i
could
devise
for
this
purpose
i
pretended
that
i
had
not
only
obtained
a
pension
but
had
also
a
fortune
left
me
by
the
death
of
a
relation
this
was
believed
as
nobody
troubled
their
heads
to
enquire
whether
it
was
true
or
not
mr
arnold
was
passionately
fond
of
the
country
and
always
passed
his
summers
there
but
as
he
could
not
think
of
parting
with
me
he
was
sadly
at
a
loss
how
to
have
me
near
him
without
bringing
on
us
both
the
observation
of
an
inquisitive
neighbourhood
such
as
all
country
places
abound
in
if
i
went
down
quite
a
stranger
as
i
was
into
essex
particularly
as
he
told
me
there
were
two
families
near
who
made
it
their
business
to
pry
into
other
people
affairs
these
were
a
lady
grimston
a
censorious
old
woman
and
the
parson
of
the
parish
who
was
a
mighty
strict
man
of
whom
mr
arnold
seemed
to
stand
in
some
awe
he
therefore
determined
against
my
going
to
that
part
of
the
world
but
having
casually
heard
me
speak
of
my
little
cottage
in
kent
where
poor
captain
gerrarde
and
i
had
lived
for
two
or
three
years
he
asked
me
whereabouts
it
was
and
was
delighted
to
find
it
joined
his
own
estate
at
south
park
and
was
within
a
mile
of
his
house
he
begged
of
me
to
go
down
to
my
own
house
which
he
insisted
on
furnishing
elegantly
for
me
and
obliged
me
also
to
keep
a
chariot
i
unwillingly
found
myself
under
a
necessity
of
complying
about
a
fortnight
after
i
was
settled
at
ashby
mr
arnold
and
his
family
came
down
then
it
was
that
for
the
first
time
i
saw
his
lady
i
went
to
pay
my
compliments
to
her
as
every
genteel
family
in
the
neighbourhood
did
and
i
own
i
never
saw
her
without
feeling
myself
shocked
to
death
at
the
thoughts
of
the
injury
i
did
her
for
i
really
believe
mrs
arnold
is
a
very
woman
oh
thou
scorpion
muttered
i
to
myself
and
yet
thou
hast
pursued
her
to
affliction
and
ruin
that
mrs
arnold
is
a
woman
said
i
coldly
i
have
no
doubt
yet
you
see
mr
arnold
opinion
of
her
virtue
was
not
strong
enough
to
be
proof
against
suspicions
for
it
is
most
certain
that
if
he
had
not
given
credit
to
your
representations
of
his
conduct
he
would
not
have
gone
such
lengths
as
to
have
parted
with
her
for
arnold
had
always
some
regard
to
appearances
representations
sir
with
a
look
of
astonishment
pray
do
not
lay
more
to
my
charge
than
i
deserve
what
the
particular
reasons
were
which
induced
mr
arnold
to
part
with
his
wife
i
will
not
say
but
whatever
his
suspicions
were
they
never
took
their
rise
from
me
i
found
she
intended
to
brazen
this
denial
out
but
as
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
my
design
to
bring
her
to
a
confession
of
this
particular
act
of
perfidy
i
resolved
to
lead
her
into
it
in
such
a
way
as
should
be
least
mortifying
to
her
pride
come
come
my
dear
mrs
gerrarde
said
i
i
know
you
are
above
concealing
any
past
failings
that
you
are
resolved
to
mend
i
know
very
well
that
it
was
insinuations
and
your
only
that
kindled
the
fire
of
jealousy
in
arnold
breast
such
arts
are
not
uncommon
in
lovers
you
loved
him
then
and
wished
to
have
him
intirely
to
yourself
and
a
wife
though
a
forsaken
one
is
still
intitled
to
so
much
attention
from
her
husband
as
a
fond
mistress
may
think
robs
her
of
too
much
i
know
this
was
the
case
and
it
is
natural
but
were
you
not
an
unmerciful
little
tyrant
to
involve
in
the
mischief
and
put
it
into
the
man
noddle
that
had
designs
upon
his
wife
the
easy
manner
in
which
i
affected
to
speak
of
this
affair
seemed
to
reconcile
her
a
little
to
the
charge
but
the
last
part
of
it
which
regarded
myself
struck
her
all
of
a
heap
she
had
no
notion
that
i
knew
it
she
was
going
to
speak
to
deny
the
accusation
i
suppose
and
therefore
i
prevented
her
and
taking
her
by
the
hand
come
now
said
i
deal
with
me
ingenuously
and
if
you
persuade
me
that
you
are
really
in
earnest
and
mean
to
repair
those
little
lapses
which
you
have
inconsiderately
been
led
into
tell
me
truly
did
you
really
believe
that
i
ever
had
any
thoughts
of
an
amour
with
mrs
arnold
i
chose
to
give
my
inquiry
this
turn
that
she
might
with
less
shame
to
herself
by
laying
hold
on
the
hint
acknowlege
her
guilt
she
hesitated
for
an
answer
and
i
guessed
she
was
considering
whether
to
persist
in
denying
the
whole
charge
against
her
or
avail
herself
of
the
handle
i
had
given
her
and
make
a
sort
of
merit
of
her
sincerity
by
pretending
to
believe
what
she
was
thoroughly
convinced
there
was
not
the
least
foundation
even
to
suspect
but
what
her
own
wicked
suggestions
had
encouraged
in
the
unfortunate
arnold
her
silence
thus
rightly
interpreted
by
me
made
me
go
on
you
see
i
know
all
your
secrets
and
you
are
not
the
woman
i
take
you
for
if
you
conceal
your
real
sentiments
in
this
particular
more
of
my
quiet
depends
on
it
than
you
are
aware
of
and
i
withdrew
my
hand
from
her
with
a
serious
and
almost
resenting
air
she
appeared
disturbed
and
in
a
good
deal
of
confusion
but
recovering
herself
why
really
mr
faulkland
i
ca
say
but
i
some
suspicion
of
what
you
mention
i
was
no
stranger
to
your
fondness
for
mrs
arnold
before
she
was
married
and
there
was
nothing
very
surprising
in
a
disappointed
lover
renewing
his
hopes
when
he
thought
the
neglect
which
a
lady
met
with
from
her
husband
might
incline
her
to
be
less
obdurate
to
a
man
she
was
once
known
to
favour
so
much
this
was
enough
i
did
not
think
it
by
any
means
necessary
to
press
her
to
a
farther
explanation
what
she
said
was
a
sufficient
acknowlegement
of
her
fault
though
the
cunning
sorceress
had
turned
the
hint
which
i
had
thrown
out
on
purpose
to
her
own
advantage
and
had
the
affrontery
to
avow
an
opinion
which
had
never
before
entered
into
her
imagination
i
found
it
necessary
now
to
carry
on
the
farce
by
assuring
her
i
had
never
entertained
a
thought
to
mrs
arnold
dishonour
and
that
though
i
made
no
great
scruple
of
robbing
a
man
of
his
mistress
yet
i
thought
it
a
crime
of
the
blackest
dye
to
deprive
him
of
the
affection
or
fidelity
of
his
wife
the
serious
manner
in
which
i
spoke
this
a
little
disconcerted
mrs
gerrarde
well
said
she
i
can
only
say
that
i
am
very
sorry
i
entertained
so
false
a
suspicion
and
more
so
as
it
has
produced
such
unhappy
consequences
but
i
hope
mr
faulkland
will
not
believe
that
i
meant
any
injury
that
i
am
sure
you
did
not
said
i
and
yet
this
very
affair
has
given
me
more
uneasiness
than
you
can
imagine
for
as
mrs
brother
is
my
most
particular
friend
he
must
think
me
the
greatest
of
villains
if
i
could
entertain
a
thought
of
dishonouring
his
family
the
fear
of
losing
his
friendship
i
own
gives
me
more
pain
than
i
can
express
and
there
is
nothing
i
would
not
do
to
exculpate
myself
to
him
i
am
very
unfortunate
cried
mrs
gerrarde
pretending
to
wipe
her
eyes
to
have
been
the
occasion
of
so
much
uneasiness
in
family
i
wish
i
had
died
before
i
was
so
unhappy
as
to
meet
with
mr
arnold
if
it
had
not
been
for
him
i
might
now
have
been
an
innocent
and
a
contented
woman
and
she
squeezed
out
a
tear
though
not
of
contrition
dear
madam
again
taking
her
hand
do
not
afflict
yourself
for
what
is
past
recalling
contentment
nay
happiness
i
hope
is
yet
within
your
reach
it
will
be
your
own
fault
if
you
do
not
lay
hold
of
it
as
for
the
unhappy
family
that
as
well
as
have
contributed
to
distress
i
wish
from
my
heart
there
could
be
a
reunion
amongst
them
mr
arnold
having
lost
you
might
perhaps
incline
him
to
turn
his
thoughts
towards
his
wife
if
he
were
not
prejudiced
against
her
by
the
suspicions
he
has
entertained
of
her
virtue
this
i
am
afraid
will
be
an
insuperable
bar
to
their
ever
living
together
unless
your
influence
which
first
gave
birth
to
his
jealousy
is
still
forcible
enough
to
remove
it
i
wish
it
were
in
my
power
said
mrs
gerrarde
there
is
nothing
i
would
not
do
to
effect
it
but
what
influence
can
i
have
on
mr
arnold
after
what
has
happened
suppose
you
were
to
write
to
him
said
i
you
and
he
probably
may
never
meet
again
and
it
would
be
an
effort
worthy
indeed
of
a
noble
mind
to
repair
the
wrongs
we
have
done
to
others
by
a
candid
acknowlegement
of
our
own
faults
putting
mrs
arnold
out
of
the
question
is
a
reparation
you
owe
character
for
however
light
the
world
may
make
of
a
piece
of
gallantry
with
a
married
woman
it
is
a
matter
of
serious
moment
to
me
to
acquit
myself
of
the
supposed
crime
to
sir
george
bidulph
if
you
think
said
she
that
my
writing
to
mr
arnold
could
produce
such
good
effects
i
am
ready
to
do
it
though
i
confess
i
hardly
know
how
to
address
him
for
he
must
to
be
sure
look
upon
me
as
the
very
reverse
of
what
i
am
and
thinks
me
without
dispute
an
ungrateful
woman
we
can
but
try
said
i
if
it
does
not
produce
the
desired
effect
it
will
not
be
your
fault
and
you
will
have
the
satisfaction
to
reflect
that
you
have
done
your
duty
i
stepped
to
my
escruitore
while
i
was
speaking
and
resolving
not
to
give
her
time
to
cool
took
out
pen
ink
and
paper
and
laid
them
on
a
little
before
her
if
this
unlucky
breach
said
i
were
once
made
up
my
mind
would
then
be
easy
she
took
the
pen
in
her
hand
but
seemed
irresolute
and
at
a
loss
how
to
begin
come
madam
said
i
and
confute
by
your
own
example
the
received
erroneous
opinion
that
if
a
woman
once
strays
from
the
paths
of
virtue
she
never
returns
to
them
a
false
and
opinion
indeed
said
she
lifting
up
her
prophane
eyes
as
in
penitence
what
am
i
to
say
you
are
to
observe
that
my
notes
as
she
went
along
while
i
dictated
are
put
between
hooks
begin
sir
for
i
would
neither
be
too
familiar
nor
too
cold
terms
on
which
you
and
i
have
lived
intitles
you
to
an
explanation
of
my
reasons
for
leaving
you
so
abruptly
and
i
hope
the
generosity
of
my
motive
will
incline
you
to
overlook
the
seeming
unkindness
of
the
action
this
you
may
assure
yourself
it
will
when
he
comes
to
consider
coolly
unhappiness
that
i
occasioned
in
your
family
by
causing
the
separation
of
you
and
your
wife
has
for
a
long
time
been
a
thorn
in
my
heart
and
the
more
so
as
besides
the
robbing
her
of
your
affections
i
own
and
take
shame
to
myself
in
the
confession
how
noble
must
he
think
this
confession
those
aspersions
which
i
threw
on
her
had
not
the
least
foundation
in
truth
this
is
truly
great
always
believed
her
perfectly
innocent
but
if
i
could
have
had
the
least
possible
doubt
of
it
before
i
must
now
be
confirmed
in
that
opinion
by
mr
faulkland
who
can
have
no
reason
for
excusing
or
concealing
facts
of
this
nature
from
me
at
present
here
she
added
of
herself
repeating
it
first
aloud
to
me
i
think
the
preference
he
has
given
me
to
her
now
in
her
state
of
separation
is
a
convincing
proof
of
this
an
admirable
argument
her
vanity
would
not
let
her
slip
this
observation
proceed
madam
true
reasons
of
my
insinuations
against
her
were
no
other
than
that
i
could
not
bear
to
share
your
affections
with
and
a
very
sufficient
reason
too
which
a
man
that
loves
can
easily
forgive
knew
that
so
long
as
she
gave
you
no
cause
of
complaint
you
were
too
just
to
withdraw
your
whole
heart
from
her
and
nothing
the
whole
would
content
me
still
you
see
you
shew
a
great
mind
true
said
she
going
on
but
my
reason
for
leaving
him
without
apprizing
him
of
it
what
are
we
to
say
for
that
oh
nothing
more
to
execute
he
will
admire
you
the
more
for
the
reason
shall
give
come
departing
without
first
making
you
acquainted
with
my
design
and
going
off
with
another
person
may
at
first
sight
seem
very
strange
but
to
tell
you
the
real
state
of
my
heart
i
found
i
could
not
trust
to
its
firmness
on
the
subject
of
parting
with
you
i
loved
you
so
that
it
was
with
pain
and
grief
i
made
the
resolution
and
i
knew
too
well
that
had
you
used
any
arguments
which
to
be
sure
you
would
have
done
to
dissuade
me
i
like
an
easy
fool
would
have
given
up
all
my
good
designs
i
am
only
afraid
this
will
make
him
love
you
more
than
ever
she
smiled
as
she
continued
to
write
for
the
other
article
this
i
was
more
puzzled
to
excuse
than
the
first
but
putting
on
a
bold
face
i
said
madam
i
hope
you
will
not
condemn
me
here
while
you
excuse
yourself
the
saying
you
were
with
will
knock
all
the
rest
on
the
head
and
he
may
chuse
whether
he
will
believe
that
you
really
intended
to
break
off
with
him
or
not
therefore
that
particular
had
better
not
be
touched
upon
well
said
she
get
me
out
of
this
scrape
as
cleverly
as
you
have
brought
me
into
it
fear
not
said
i
go
on
for
the
other
article
though
i
shall
never
love
mr
faulkland
as
i
have
done
you
yet
in
him
i
have
found
a
protector
and
through
his
means
i
hope
to
pass
the
remainder
of
my
life
in
a
manner
more
suitable
to
a
woman
of
a
generous
way
of
thinking
than
that
wherein
she
considered
herself
as
encroaching
on
the
rights
of
another
i
hope
by
this
sacrifice
which
i
have
made
of
my
love
to
a
more
heroic
principle
that
i
shall
expiate
my
former
offence
and
that
you
will
follow
my
example
so
far
as
to
make
what
reparation
you
can
to
the
woman
we
have
both
injured
how
this
must
raise
how
exalt
you
in
his
opinion
i
think
it
must
cried
she
bridling
up
her
head
as
if
they
were
really
her
own
sentiments
i
believe
said
i
this
is
all
that
is
necessary
to
be
said
you
may
add
in
a
postscript
that
as
he
furnished
the
house
for
you
at
ashby
every
thing
in
it
is
at
his
service
together
with
your
chariot
and
horses
which
were
also
his
gifts
she
demurred
to
this
and
in
the
midst
of
her
heroics
said
i
wish
i
could
get
somebody
to
sell
them
for
me
privately
and
remit
the
money
to
me
for
since
i
here
i
should
like
to
see
a
little
more
of
france
before
i
return
i
told
her
that
would
look
mean
and
below
a
well
said
she
let
them
go
i
owe
all
my
servants
a
year
wages
and
another
person
about
fifty
pounds
for
a
little
temple
he
had
just
built
in
my
garden
but
not
quite
finished
when
i
came
away
i
think
i
had
better
desire
those
debts
to
be
discharged
i
have
always
been
very
punctual
in
my
dealings
and
would
not
for
the
world
anybody
you
are
in
the
right
said
i
it
will
look
honourable
in
you
to
desire
those
debts
to
be
paid
she
now
proceeded
to
conclude
her
letter
in
the
same
stile
she
had
begun
it
and
added
a
postscript
to
the
purport
i
mentioned
i
hastened
to
make
her
seal
it
up
and
direct
it
to
mr
arnold
at
his
house
in
london
who
i
suppose
has
had
the
pleasure
of
receiving
it
before
now
for
i
dispatched
it
off
directly
i
flatter
myself
with
the
hope
that
it
will
have
the
desired
effect
on
him
you
will
think
perhaps
that
as
i
have
managed
it
i
have
really
given
her
a
sort
of
merit
with
him
in
the
acknowlegement
of
her
fault
and
the
pretended
reason
she
gives
for
leaving
him
no
such
thing
sir
george
arnold
is
a
man
of
too
much
sense
and
knows
the
world
too
well
to
be
so
deceived
i
have
been
told
by
my
lord
v
knows
him
perfectly
that
nobody
judges
better
when
he
is
not
blinded
by
his
passions
all
her
professions
must
go
for
nothing
when
are
against
her
is
plain
she
went
off
with
another
man
and
to
all
appearances
premeditately
as
her
maid
and
her
riches
bore
her
company
is
also
plain
by
her
own
confession
that
this
man
stands
well
with
her
as
for
her
recanting
her
injurious
aspersions
on
poor
mrs
arnold
is
the
only
circumstance
in
her
letter
likely
to
gain
belief
as
she
could
have
no
temptation
to
that
but
real
compunction
with
which
people
of
that
kind
are
sometimes
visited
and
for
the
rest
of
her
letter
to
any
one
of
common
understanding
that
lays
circumstances
together
it
will
appear
as
i
intended
it
should
the
contrivance
of
an
artful
jilt
who
having
almost
ruined
the
wretch
she
has
had
in
her
power
would
afterwards
make
a
of
deserting
him
for
they
must
be
hardened
reprobates
indeed
that
would
not
if
they
could
at
least
to
palliate
their
evil
deeds
this
is
the
light
i
expect
arnold
will
consider
her
in
i
know
he
is
hurt
deeply
in
his
fortune
by
this
vile
harpy
i
hope
the
remnant
may
be
sufficient
to
support
your
excellent
sister
if
not
in
affluence
at
least
with
comfort
should
she
regain
her
influence
over
him
and
submit
to
live
with
him
again
this
i
am
sure
will
be
the
consequence
if
he
is
not
blind
to
his
own
happiness
i
shall
be
impatient
to
know
how
the
letter
operates
on
him
but
this
you
are
not
likely
to
be
let
into
and
perhaps
his
pride
may
make
him
endeavour
to
conceal
it
from
my
lord
v
i
am
sure
will
pick
up
some
intelligence
and
send
it
to
me
i
think
mrs
gerrarde
confession
in
regard
to
mrs
arnold
to
which
she
could
have
no
interested
motive
with
the
corroborating
circumstance
of
going
off
with
her
at
a
time
when
mrs
arnold
was
from
under
her
husband
protection
injured
by
him
in
the
tenderest
point
and
aspersed
by
a
barbarous
and
invidious
world
all
this
i
say
must
surely
clear
from
all
suspicion
that
admirable
creature
for
who
that
knows
mrs
arnold
would
think
that
any
man
except
her
husband
would
prefer
any
woman
upon
earth
to
her
if
this
does
not
remove
all
doubt
of
her
conduct
in
arnold
as
well
as
in
the
rest
of
the
world
my
pains
have
been
to
little
purpose
and
i
know
no
other
human
means
that
can
be
used
to
disabuse
the
mad
credulity
of
that
man
i
pity
him
from
my
heart
in
his
present
situation
for
it
will
be
some
time
before
he
will
be
sensible
of
the
good
i
have
done
him
and
i
dare
swear
the
man
is
at
this
time
so
ungrateful
that
if
he
could
he
would
cut
my
throat
i
do
not
want
to
have
him
know
the
extent
of
his
obligation
to
me
i
shall
be
satisfied
to
sit
down
in
the
contemplation
of
my
meritorious
actions
without
enjoying
the
fame
of
them
this
greatness
of
mind
i
learnt
of
mrs
gerrarde
but
to
return
the
having
gained
my
material
point
put
me
into
such
spirits
that
i
could
have
kissed
mrs
gerrarde
a
liberty
which
i
assure
you
however
i
never
presumed
to
take
she
for
her
part
seemed
as
well
pleased
with
what
she
had
done
as
i
was
i
praised
her
for
the
part
she
had
acted
though
i
very
much
feared
she
would
repent
of
it
when
we
came
to
explanations
which
i
resolved
should
be
on
that
very
day
i
told
her
i
hoped
she
would
oblige
me
with
her
company
at
dinner
she
consented
with
a
bow
i
had
ordered
one
to
be
got
ready
earlier
than
usual
and
directed
that
it
should
be
in
her
apartment
we
were
told
it
was
on
table
i
never
saw
mrs
gerrarde
so
agreeable
as
she
was
during
dinner
she
was
in
high
spirits
and
i
almost
thought
it
a
pity
to
let
her
down
that
day
but
i
considered
the
longer
her
expectations
were
kept
up
the
greater
would
be
her
disappointment
and
out
of
pure
charity
i
determined
to
put
her
out
of
doubt
i
had
been
told
mrs
gerrarde
was
no
enemy
to
a
chearful
glass
but
the
designs
she
had
formed
upon
me
put
her
on
her
guard
and
i
observed
she
drank
nothing
but
wine
and
water
made
very
small
this
i
was
afraid
would
not
be
sufficient
to
keep
up
her
courage
under
what
i
intended
to
say
to
her
i
pretended
to
be
disposed
to
drink
and
insisted
on
her
helping
me
out
with
a
flask
of
burgundy
with
affected
coyness
she
suffered
me
to
fill
her
glass
the
second
offer
i
made
her
resistance
was
less
the
third
she
made
no
objection
to
at
all
and
the
fourth
she
filled
for
herself
the
wine
was
excellent
not
that
poor
sort
which
is
commonly
drunk
in
france
in
short
we
finished
our
bottle
i
thought
her
now
a
match
for
what
i
had
to
say
i
had
made
the
glass
pass
briskly
and
had
filled
up
the
intervals
with
singing
catches
and
rattling
on
any
subject
that
came
into
my
head
mrs
gerrarde
who
no
doubt
expected
i
should
make
an
advance
of
some
kind
or
other
seemed
to
grow
a
little
out
of
humour
at
my
levity
i
found
the
burgundy
had
been
quite
thrown
away
upon
her
and
had
had
very
little
effect
she
was
silent
for
a
few
minutes
and
seemed
to
be
considering
of
something
at
last
she
opened
and
i
will
give
you
the
conversation
that
passed
between
us
by
way
of
dialogue
mr
faulkland
it
is
time
that
you
and
i
should
understand
one
another
meaning
a
little
better
than
we
do
at
present
you
know
very
well
that
you
have
put
an
end
to
all
my
expectations
in
england
indeed
if
i
were
at
liberty
i
could
not
have
the
face
to
return
there
again
in
any
character
but
that
of
your
wife
i
was
glad
she
began
first
and
that
though
i
guessed
at
her
views
she
had
used
so
little
caution
in
discovering
them
as
it
at
once
roused
in
me
an
indignation
which
i
could
not
suppress
and
without
which
i
could
not
have
brought
myself
to
mortify
her
as
she
deserved
my
madam
stopping
her
at
that
tremendous
word
be
pleased
to
tell
me
if
i
heard
you
right
yes
sir
it
was
as
your
wife
i
said
if
you
think
you
and
i
are
to
live
together
on
any
other
terms
you
will
find
yourself
exceedingly
mistaken
i
smiled
and
suffered
her
to
go
on
i
thought
sir
stifling
the
anger
that
i
saw
rising
that
the
words
which
you
yourself
dictated
in
the
letter
which
i
just
now
wrote
where
you
say
had
in
you
found
a
protector
and
one
by
whose
means
i
should
be
able
to
pass
the
rest
of
my
life
in
a
manner
more
suitable
to
a
woman
of
a
generous
way
of
thinking
than
that
wherein
she
considered
herself
as
incroaching
on
the
rights
of
were
not
these
your
own
words
sir
they
were
madam
to
say
the
truth
there
was
something
equivocal
in
the
paragraph
though
when
i
desired
her
to
write
it
this
construction
never
entered
into
my
head
then
sir
how
am
i
to
understand
them
i
protest
madam
you
have
forced
a
construction
that
i
never
once
so
much
as
dreamed
of
why
mr
faulkland
with
a
very
brisk
tone
do
you
fancy
that
by
changing
mr
arnold
for
on
any
other
conditions
that
i
am
such
a
mighty
gainer
by
the
bargain
why
really
madam
if
that
to
be
the
case
i
think
you
would
be
a
very
great
loser
you
have
got
as
much
from
poor
arnold
as
you
could
expect
i
am
able
to
do
better
for
you
and
as
i
am
nobody
property
it
would
certainly
in
respect
be
rather
a
more
eligible
course
sir
you
use
me
very
ill
i
did
not
expect
such
treatment
how
pray
madam
did
i
ever
say
i
would
marry
you
no
sir
but
your
behaviour
has
given
me
room
to
suppose
that
such
a
thing
was
in
your
thoughts
are
you
not
then
the
more
obliged
to
me
for
treating
you
with
such
respect
as
made
you
fancy
so
respect
respect
muttering
between
her
teeth
mr
faulkland
and
she
stood
up
there
is
not
a
man
in
england
but
yourself
after
what
i
have
declared
that
would
refuse
making
me
his
wife
what
have
you
declared
mrs
gerrarde
why
have
i
not
ingenuously
owned
my
failings
shewed
myself
sorry
for
them
quitted
them
and
made
all
the
reparation
in
my
power
i
was
amazed
to
see
how
audaciously
she
had
adopted
as
her
own
the
sentiments
which
i
had
suggested
to
her
it
was
so
like
her
that
i
could
have
laughed
in
her
face
your
behaviour
on
this
occasion
has
really
been
worthy
of
the
imitation
of
all
your
own
sex
and
the
praise
of
ours
for
a
woman
to
quit
an
irregular
life
and
that
too
from
mere
motives
of
i
was
stopped
by
a
knavish
sneer
which
i
could
not
subdue
she
saw
it
and
fired
immediately
but
strutted
about
the
room
to
cool
herself
at
last
for
i
sat
very
silent
looking
at
her
and
playing
with
one
of
the
glasses
mr
faulkland
if
you
are
disposed
to
have
done
trifling
and
will
vouchsafe
me
a
serious
answer
pray
tell
me
are
you
absolutely
determined
not
to
marry
me
absolutely
you
are
not
serious
sure
my
dear
creature
why
sure
canst
not
be
serious
in
asking
me
the
question
sir
i
serious
and
expect
a
serious
answer
why
then
seriously
i
have
no
more
thoughts
of
marrying
thee
than
i
have
of
marrying
the
first
sultana
in
the
grand
seignior
seraglio
very
well
sir
very
well
i
am
answered
and
she
walked
quicker
about
the
room
than
before
we
were
both
silent
she
i
suppose
expected
that
i
should
propose
other
terms
and
a
settlement
and
waited
to
try
if
i
would
speak
i
had
a
mind
to
teaze
her
a
little
and
hummed
a
tune
advancing
to
me
and
making
a
low
with
a
most
scornful
and
sarcastical
air
may
i
presume
to
enquire
what
your
mightiness
pleasure
is
in
regard
to
me
do
you
intend
to
keep
me
for
your
nurse
against
your
next
illness
or
to
send
me
to
the
grand
seignior
seraglio
to
wait
upon
the
first
sultana
neither
carelessly
and
looking
another
way
i
have
not
yet
determined
which
way
i
shall
dispose
of
you
of
me
of
me
why
sure
the
man
has
lost
his
senses
look
you
mrs
gerrarde
we
will
no
longer
play
at
sit
down
and
be
calm
for
a
few
minutes
till
you
hear
what
i
have
to
say
she
did
so
with
a
kind
of
impatience
in
her
looks
that
informed
me
i
might
have
made
a
very
free
proposal
without
any
great
danger
of
her
resentment
how
long
have
you
and
i
been
acquainted
lord
what
is
that
question
to
the
purpose
is
only
in
order
to
my
desiring
you
would
look
back
and
upon
recollection
ask
yourself
if
you
ever
had
any
reason
to
look
upon
me
as
your
lover
i
made
that
observation
to
you
when
we
were
travelling
together
what
is
the
use
of
it
now
did
i
in
the
course
of
our
journey
declare
myself
to
be
such
or
drop
the
least
hint
of
devoting
myself
to
you
on
any
condition
we
did
not
talk
on
the
subject
at
all
did
i
ever
presume
on
the
advantage
of
having
you
in
my
power
to
venture
on
the
smallest
liberty
with
you
or
ever
deviate
from
that
respect
in
my
behaviour
that
i
was
used
at
all
other
times
to
treat
you
with
i
do
not
say
you
did
and
it
was
that
very
behaviour
that
inclined
me
to
imagine
you
had
other
thoughts
than
those
i
find
you
have
you
drew
a
wrong
conclusion
though
it
is
to
be
confessed
not
a
very
unnatural
one
such
a
behaviour
might
have
been
so
construed
by
a
lady
otherwise
circumstanced
than
you
were
but
i
think
a
woman
of
your
sagacity
might
have
concluded
that
with
mrs
gerrarde
a
man
would
first
have
tried
his
fortune
upon
gentler
terms
than
those
of
matrimony
well
well
peevishly
i
do
not
understand
your
riddles
to
the
point
why
the
point
in
short
is
this
that
without
any
particular
designs
on
your
person
my
whole
view
in
carrying
you
out
of
england
was
to
break
off
your
intercourse
with
mr
arnold
she
seemed
but
recovering
herself
and
is
what
i
am
to
hear
calmly
and
she
flounced
off
the
chair
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
i
followed
her
and
taking
her
hand
begged
she
would
sit
down
again
and
hear
me
out
i
drew
her
to
a
chair
and
gently
set
her
down
in
it
now
for
your
own
sake
hear
me
with
patience
violence
or
perverseness
will
be
of
no
use
to
you
very
well
sir
i
am
your
prisoner
your
at
present
say
what
you
please
is
turn
well
then
madam
as
i
said
before
i
really
never
had
any
designs
upon
you
merely
on
your
own
account
i
allow
you
to
be
a
very
fine
woman
and
capable
of
inspiring
love
in
any
man
that
sees
you
but
i
must
tell
you
plainly
that
has
had
no
share
in
my
conduct
i
saw
stifled
rage
in
her
face
but
i
proceeded
i
have
already
told
you
the
real
motive
of
my
carrying
you
off
it
was
as
i
said
to
dissolve
the
union
between
you
and
mr
arnold
and
my
reasons
for
wishing
to
do
so
are
these
mr
arnold
is
married
to
one
of
the
best
women
living
for
whom
i
have
the
highest
respect
and
esteem
and
whom
i
once
adored
that
lady
has
by
your
influence
over
her
husband
not
only
been
thrown
out
from
his
heart
but
even
thrust
out
from
his
house
but
the
calamity
stops
not
there
she
is
cruelly
aspersed
by
the
world
through
your
suggestions
and
i
am
the
person
pointed
at
for
the
injurer
of
mr
arnold
honour
and
the
destroyer
of
his
wife
innocence
you
have
brought
shame
and
grief
into
a
worthy
family
lady
bidulph
an
excellent
woman
has
not
been
able
to
overcome
the
shock
of
the
barbarous
treatment
her
daughter
has
met
with
her
brother
the
beloved
friend
of
my
heart
suffers
equal
distress
for
though
he
is
conscious
of
his
innocence
he
feels
the
wounds
that
her
reputation
has
received
nor
can
he
possibly
redress
the
mischief
as
his
sister
injuries
spring
from
a
cause
which
her
delicacy
will
not
permit
to
be
scrutinized
her
two
poor
children
are
left
without
a
mother
she
herself
almost
without
a
friend
and
sinking
every
day
under
the
weight
of
such
complicated
misery
as
for
mr
arnold
himself
i
profess
no
personal
regard
for
him
i
scarce
know
him
but
for
his
family
sake
i
would
on
any
occasion
risque
my
life
to
save
him
from
ruin
for
ruin
you
have
almost
brought
on
him
i
am
no
stranger
to
the
sums
he
has
lavished
on
you
his
purchasing
an
employment
for
of
your
brothers
and
redeeming
another
from
a
prison
you
have
lost
nothing
by
my
proceedings
but
what
i
shall
make
up
to
you
if
you
behave
so
as
to
deserve
my
kindness
i
have
now
laid
before
you
the
true
reasons
for
my
conduct
i
hope
that
by
breaking
the
inchantment
that
tied
mr
arnold
heart
and
blinded
his
understanding
he
may
be
induced
to
do
justice
to
his
injured
lady
and
her
family
if
this
comes
to
pass
as
i
have
strong
reason
to
hope
i
have
no
doubt
of
the
lady
character
being
retrieved
calumnies
generally
die
of
themselves
unless
industriously
kept
alive
by
malice
mrs
arnold
blameless
conduct
the
friendship
her
brother
has
all
along
continued
to
favour
me
with
joined
to
this
last
apparent
proof
of
my
attachment
to
you
will
i
am
certain
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
acquit
her
of
all
suspicion
of
guilt
your
letter
to
mr
arnold
will
as
far
as
relates
to
your
own
opinion
of
her
give
unquestionable
evidence
of
her
innocence
now
mrs
gerrarde
lay
your
hand
on
your
heart
and
answer
me
if
i
have
not
given
you
reasons
which
though
they
may
not
be
satisfactory
to
you
are
in
themselves
of
weight
sufficient
to
justify
my
conduct
i
had
watched
her
countenance
narrowly
during
my
discourse
which
she
had
listened
to
without
once
looking
at
me
i
saw
i
had
shocked
and
even
confounded
her
but
i
saw
no
remorse
no
contrition
in
her
looks
all
artifice
was
now
at
an
end
and
she
unmasked
the
fiend
directly
she
started
off
her
chair
with
the
looks
and
gesture
of
a
fury
and
fixing
her
eyes
which
had
really
something
diabolical
in
them
at
that
instant
steadily
on
me
you
wretch
she
cried
with
a
voice
answerable
to
her
looks
you
are
such
a
false
dissembling
reptile
that
if
you
had
a
kingdom
to
offer
me
and
would
lay
yourself
at
my
feet
to
beg
my
acceptance
of
you
i
would
trample
on
you
like
dirt
and
she
stamped
on
the
floor
with
the
air
of
an
amazon
do
you
think
you
shall
carry
on
this
enterprize
no
if
i
perish
for
it
i
will
have
vengeance
mr
arnold
shall
know
how
i
have
been
deceived
and
betrayed
and
i
will
at
least
have
the
satisfaction
of
getting
your
life
if
i
lose
every
thing
besides
a
burst
of
malignant
tears
now
gushed
from
her
eyes
but
she
robbed
them
of
their
efficacy
by
mixing
with
them
the
bitterest
imprecations
against
me
she
curst
even
the
innocent
mrs
arnold
you
and
the
whole
family
and
her
own
folly
in
being
blinded
by
the
arts
of
such
a
worthless
as
myself
i
let
her
give
vent
to
her
passion
calmly
walking
about
the
room
all
the
time
only
now
and
then
casting
an
eye
on
her
for
fear
she
should
have
rushed
on
me
with
a
penknife
for
i
have
not
the
least
doubt
if
she
had
had
such
an
instrument
about
her
she
would
have
made
an
attempt
that
might
have
given
a
very
tragical
turn
to
my
adventures
when
she
had
done
sobbing
i
addressed
her
in
a
very
stern
voice
for
i
found
i
had
no
baby
to
deal
with
and
therefore
resolved
to
frighten
her
into
submission
i
told
you
before
madam
that
violence
would
be
of
no
use
to
you
your
menaces
i
laugh
at
you
are
in
my
power
intirely
and
absolutely
at
my
disposal
to
think
of
getting
out
of
my
hands
would
be
vain
for
it
is
as
impracticable
as
flying
no
mortal
knows
where
you
are
but
the
people
of
this
house
who
are
strangers
to
your
name
and
circumstances
and
if
they
knew
both
they
are
so
totally
at
my
devotion
that
it
would
not
avail
you
i
shall
cut
off
all
possibility
of
a
correspondence
to
england
what
then
must
be
your
resource
i
am
prepared
against
all
events
and
i
would
carry
you
about
locked
up
in
an
iron
cage
like
the
turkish
tyrant
till
i
had
subdued
that
termagant
spirit
sooner
than
you
should
have
your
liberty
to
do
more
mischief
if
you
have
any
regard
to
your
own
interest
you
will
endeavour
to
make
me
your
friend
i
have
the
power
and
the
will
to
serve
you
i
have
done
you
no
injury
i
said
i
would
be
your
protector
and
so
i
will
if
you
will
suffer
me
to
be
so
i
said
i
would
be
the
means
of
your
passing
your
days
in
a
state
more
eligible
to
a
woman
of
either
spirit
discretion
or
a
grain
of
honour
than
you
have
hitherto
done
this
i
am
ready
to
make
good
if
you
will
not
be
wanting
on
your
part
to
your
own
happiness
you
have
acknowleged
that
you
are
conscious
of
your
own
errors
are
sorry
for
them
and
are
willing
to
quit
them
this
was
turning
her
own
weapons
against
herself
if
you
are
in
earnest
in
this
declaration
i
will
give
you
the
means
of
quitting
them
the
money
you
have
now
in
your
possession
even
with
the
addition
of
your
little
jointure
is
not
sufficient
to
promise
you
such
a
support
as
would
make
you
easy
if
you
were
to
return
to
england
and
your
story
known
as
it
would
be
what
could
you
expect
do
you
think
arnold
could
be
so
besotted
as
to
receive
you
again
what
must
be
your
resource
why
to
continue
while
your
beauty
lasts
in
a
wretched
abandoned
course
ten
thousand
to
one
you
might
never
light
on
another
whose
love
would
be
prodigal
enough
to
enrich
you
the
only
choice
left
you
is
to
stay
where
you
are
not
known
and
where
if
you
behave
well
you
may
gain
the
respect
and
esteem
which
you
could
never
hope
for
in
a
place
where
your
history
is
known
if
you
will
content
yourself
with
an
easy
fortune
joined
to
a
life
of
virtue
and
tranquillity
i
will
provide
you
with
a
husband
that
many
a
woman
in
your
circumstances
would
bless
her
stars
for
i
will
double
the
portion
you
have
already
and
get
it
settled
on
you
and
will
on
certain
conditions
add
a
handsome
yearly
income
if
you
do
not
like
this
proposal
i
have
no
other
alternative
to
offer
but
a
nunnery
i
know
you
were
bred
a
roman
catholic
i
am
sure
therefore
i
shall
do
no
violence
to
your
religious
scruples
if
you
have
any
i
can
get
you
admitted
with
ease
the
religious
here
will
think
it
a
meritorious
act
in
me
especially
on
the
terms
i
shall
propose
for
i
will
make
it
worth
their
while
to
receive
and
treat
you
as
a
lady
of
the
first
family
in
france
but
remember
there
is
a
final
period
to
all
intercourse
with
this
world
if
you
think
you
can
bring
yourself
to
submit
to
such
a
life
i
would
really
recommend
it
to
you
for
i
am
sollicitous
for
your
happiness
both
here
and
hereafter
if
not
you
have
the
other
choice
to
make
and
so
madam
a
husband
or
a
convent
take
which
you
like
best
i
give
you
three
days
to
consider
of
it
i
kept
up
a
severe
countenance
and
a
resolute
tone
i
rang
the
bell
as
soon
as
i
had
done
speaking
rachael
came
in
before
mrs
gerrarde
could
answer
me
take
care
of
your
mistress
said
i
and
left
the
room
without
even
the
ceremony
of
a
bow
or
deigning
to
look
at
her
i
locked
the
chamber
door
which
i
took
care
to
clap
after
me
and
putting
the
key
in
my
pocket
left
the
lady
and
her
maid
to
consult
at
their
leisure
you
know
bidulph
i
am
not
naturally
morose
and
that
i
am
not
very
apt
to
be
wanting
in
that
complaisance
which
all
women
expect
and
which
i
really
think
due
to
all
women
but
this
one
had
in
the
preceding
scene
so
intirely
thrown
off
her
sex
that
i
could
hardly
consider
her
as
a
female
i
had
known
many
of
her
ill
qualities
before
but
those
she
now
discovered
if
they
did
not
shew
her
more
wicked
certainly
rendered
her
more
disgustful
to
me
than
the
others
in
short
i
found
that
all
decorum
was
to
be
laid
aside
i
had
gone
too
far
not
to
put
the
finishing
hand
to
my
work
and
i
had
no
other
measures
to
observe
but
to
finish
by
dint
of
force
what
i
had
begun
by
stratagem
when
i
mentioned
the
nunnery
to
you
in
a
former
letter
it
was
in
mere
gaiety
of
heart
i
had
no
serious
thoughts
of
that
kind
nor
did
i
now
propose
it
as
a
practicable
scheme
i
knew
the
woman
too
well
to
suppose
she
would
acquiesce
though
to
confess
the
truth
to
you
honestly
i
think
if
she
refuses
my
other
plan
of
accommodation
i
must
compel
her
to
accept
of
this
nor
ought
it
to
be
considered
in
any
other
light
than
that
of
confining
a
wild
beast
who
having
already
done
a
great
deal
of
mischief
would
still
do
more
if
left
at
liberty
but
i
think
i
shall
not
be
driven
to
this
i
believe
she
will
accept
of
a
husband
with
a
good
settlement
sooner
than
resign
her
liberty
and
now
who
do
you
think
the
husband
is
whom
i
have
under
contemplation
for
her
why
no
less
a
man
than
my
valet
de
chambre
monsieur
pivet
he
is
young
and
handsome
of
good
parts
and
a
man
of
birth
he
tells
me
he
has
an
uncle
that
is
a
marquis
and
three
or
four
cousins
that
are
in
the
high
court
of
parliament
without
a
joke
the
fellow
is
of
a
pretty
good
family
he
was
bred
a
mercer
and
in
a
frolic
had
run
away
from
his
business
when
i
picked
him
up
at
paris
at
the
time
you
and
i
were
there
together
he
then
told
me
that
he
only
hired
with
me
for
an
opportunity
of
seeing
a
little
of
the
world
and
that
he
would
one
time
or
other
sit
down
and
settle
to
his
trade
i
have
sounded
him
on
the
point
and
find
him
very
ready
to
accept
of
the
lady
with
all
her
faults
i
told
you
i
introduced
him
to
mrs
gerrarde
to
serve
as
her
interpreter
in
the
house
at
the
time
i
was
ill
i
did
not
then
tell
her
who
he
was
and
both
she
and
her
maid
take
him
for
no
other
than
an
acquaintance
of
mine
who
happens
to
lodge
in
the
same
house
with
us
the
vain
rogue
has
encouraged
this
opinion
and
i
suppose
passes
for
a
very
pretty
fellow
with
them
for
you
know
pivet
is
a
beau
and
is
really
not
ungenteel
but
do
not
fancy
that
i
intend
to
impose
him
on
the
lady
for
any
other
than
what
he
really
is
all
disguise
is
now
laid
aside
and
i
shall
proceed
with
the
utmost
plainness
and
sincerity
as
soon
as
i
know
the
lady
mind
in
regard
to
her
choice
here
my
dear
sir
george
i
must
take
breath
a
little
it
has
been
a
busy
day
i
undertook
a
difficult
voyage
without
the
certainty
of
a
a
few
storms
i
expected
to
encounter
i
hope
i
have
weathered
the
worst
and
have
come
at
length
to
some
prospect
of
an
harbour
i
expect
my
next
greeting
to
you
will
be
from
a
fairer
upon
second
thoughts
i
will
not
send
this
off
till
i
can
put
both
you
and
myself
out
of
the
reach
of
suspence
congratulate
me
sir
george
honour
me
as
the
first
of
politicians
the
greatest
of
negotiators
let
no
hero
of
romance
compare
himself
to
me
for
first
making
difficulties
and
then
extricating
myself
out
of
them
let
no
giant
pretend
to
equal
me
in
the
management
of
captive
beauties
in
inchanted
castles
let
no
necromancer
presume
to
vie
with
me
in
skill
for
metamorphosing
tigresses
into
doves
and
changing
imperious
princesses
into
plain
country
nymphs
this
i
have
brought
to
pass
without
the
assistance
of
enchanted
sword
or
dwarf
in
the
compass
of
a
few
days
but
take
the
circumstances
in
the
order
they
occurred
i
left
the
lady
as
i
told
you
to
utter
her
complaints
to
her
confidante
rachael
a
simple
girl
who
had
just
sense
enough
to
regard
her
own
interest
was
not
likely
to
give
her
mistress
much
consolation
for
she
was
at
least
as
much
friend
as
her
how
passed
the
night
i
know
not
for
my
own
part
i
slept
in
perfect
tranquillity
i
desired
pivet
in
the
morning
to
go
and
inquire
as
from
himself
how
the
lady
rested
mrs
gerrarde
who
was
still
in
bed
no
sooner
heard
his
voice
in
the
outer
room
as
he
was
speaking
to
her
maid
than
she
called
out
to
monsieur
pivet
and
desired
he
would
be
so
good
as
to
step
into
her
chamber
pivet
not
much
abashed
at
being
admitted
to
a
lady
obeyed
her
summons
and
placed
himself
in
an
armed
chair
by
her
he
said
he
hoped
it
was
not
owing
to
illness
that
he
saw
her
in
bed
yes
sir
said
she
i
am
exceedingly
ill
i
have
not
slept
the
whole
night
and
am
now
in
a
high
fever
has
mr
faulkland
told
you
any
thing
in
relation
to
me
i
had
prepared
pivet
and
he
had
his
answers
ready
madam
said
he
i
am
not
a
stranger
to
your
situation
and
am
exceedingly
sorry
for
it
i
wish
the
little
influence
have
over
mr
faulkland
could
be
employed
for
your
service
but
he
is
a
positive
man
very
enterprising
and
not
to
be
controlled
by
do
you
know
my
story
sir
cried
mrs
gerrarde
he
bowed
and
looked
down
mrs
gerrarde
understanding
this
as
an
affirmative
and
raising
herself
up
a
little
cried
out
a
base
ungenerous
man
does
he
intend
to
expose
me
wherever
he
goes
by
no
means
madam
answered
pivet
there
is
nothing
in
your
story
that
would
do
you
the
least
injury
in
opinion
here
the
ladies
in
france
do
not
think
it
any
disgrace
to
have
lovers
you
are
very
obliging
sir
she
replied
and
perhaps
i
have
as
much
to
say
in
my
vindication
as
any
woman
but
sure
never
was
mortal
used
in
the
barbarous
manner
i
am
do
you
know
the
proposal
he
had
the
insolence
to
make
me
last
night
either
to
take
a
husband
of
chusing
low
fellow
i
suppose
he
thinks
good
enough
for
me
or
immediately
to
go
into
a
nunnery
oh
sir
and
she
catched
hold
of
his
hand
as
you
are
a
gentleman
if
you
have
compassion
any
humanity
towards
an
unfortunate
woman
try
to
deliver
me
out
of
his
hands
i
have
a
pretty
good
sum
of
money
in
my
possession
contrive
the
means
of
my
escape
my
gratitude
to
you
shall
be
unbounded
and
she
wrung
his
hand
ah
madam
said
pivet
looking
tenderly
at
her
i
would
it
were
in
my
power
i
should
think
myself
but
too
happy
if
it
were
possible
for
me
to
accomplish
what
you
request
but
i
fear
it
will
be
impracticable
i
declare
to
you
if
i
were
at
my
own
disposal
i
would
fly
with
you
to
the
remotest
part
of
the
world
but
i
am
a
young
man
who
have
my
fortune
to
make
i
am
under
particular
ties
here
and
have
besides
such
obligations
to
mr
faulkland
as
makes
it
impossible
for
me
consistently
with
to
interfere
in
this
business
sir
said
she
eagerly
ca
you
write
a
letter
for
me
or
furnish
me
with
the
means
of
informing
my
friends
in
england
of
my
situation
madam
said
he
before
mr
faulkland
permitted
me
the
honour
of
seeing
you
he
engaged
my
solemn
promise
that
i
would
not
intermeddle
in
your
affairs
lord
what
will
become
of
me
what
would
you
sir
advise
me
to
do
for
as
for
that
wretch
meaning
me
i
am
determined
if
i
can
help
it
not
to
suffer
him
to
come
near
me
is
a
very
nice
point
madam
i
really
do
not
well
know
how
to
advise
but
to
be
sure
a
nunnery
is
a
choice
not
to
be
recommended
to
a
lady
of
your
youth
and
beauty
unless
your
inclinations
lead
you
that
way
then
indeed
she
interrupted
him
do
name
it
to
me
sir
do
name
it
i
am
determined
to
keep
out
of
snare
if
it
be
for
nothing
but
an
opportunity
to
be
revenged
on
that
tyrant
i
would
marry
a
beggar
sooner
than
give
up
that
hope
as
for
that
madam
said
pivet
i
suppose
mr
faulkland
would
not
be
so
ungenerous
as
to
compel
you
to
marry
one
beneath
you
there
are
many
young
men
of
good
families
who
would
think
themselves
honoured
by
your
acceptance
of
them
your
personal
accomplishments
alone
are
a
sufficient
recommendation
but
mr
faulkland
mentioned
to
me
the
additional
advantage
of
fortune
i
dare
answer
for
him
he
will
not
think
of
bestowing
you
unworthily
i
had
charged
pivet
not
to
go
too
far
he
thought
it
time
to
break
off
the
conversation
and
rising
up
he
told
mrs
gerrarde
he
was
going
into
my
apartment
and
desired
to
know
if
she
would
honour
him
with
any
commands
sir
said
she
i
shall
only
beg
you
will
tell
mr
faulkland
that
i
never
think
of
his
proposal
that
i
am
very
ill
and
beg
to
be
left
in
quiet
for
a
few
days
but
shall
be
very
glad
to
see
whenever
you
are
at
leisure
he
bowed
and
left
her
then
came
directly
to
me
and
repeated
the
conversation
he
had
with
her
word
for
word
i
am
glad
said
i
to
find
you
are
so
much
in
her
good
graces
it
will
accelerate
my
plot
but
we
must
not
make
you
too
cheap
if
we
manage
discreetly
she
may
possibly
think
herself
very
well
to
get
off
with
you
at
present
i
stand
pretty
well
with
her
sir
said
pivet
she
does
not
suspect
that
i
am
your
servant
i
fear
if
she
did
as
the
lady
seems
to
have
a
high
spirit
she
would
forbid
me
her
presence
i
found
pivet
had
no
mind
to
have
this
part
of
his
situation
explained
his
vanity
had
been
highly
tickled
at
passing
upon
her
for
a
gentleman
and
he
had
in
obedience
to
my
orders
spent
much
of
his
time
with
her
during
the
few
days
that
i
had
been
too
ill
to
see
her
i
had
at
my
first
introduction
of
him
to
her
cautioned
him
against
letting
her
know
in
what
capacity
he
was
with
me
i
did
not
then
give
him
my
reasons
for
this
and
he
supposed
they
were
no
other
than
that
finding
it
necessary
to
have
him
pretty
much
with
her
in
her
confinement
i
did
not
chuse
to
alarm
her
pride
by
the
knowlege
of
his
station
i
did
not
hint
at
my
design
till
the
day
before
i
had
prevailed
on
her
to
write
the
letter
to
mr
arnold
pivet
did
not
at
all
disrelish
the
proposal
he
had
not
been
blind
to
mrs
gerrarde
charms
he
only
seemed
surprized
at
my
being
willing
to
part
with
her
so
soon
for
he
had
not
the
least
conception
of
my
reasons
for
carrying
her
off
and
very
naturally
concluded
i
was
deeply
engaged
in
an
amour
it
was
not
difficult
to
guess
his
thoughts
on
this
occasion
pivet
said
i
i
must
premise
one
thing
to
you
i
assure
you
there
is
not
nor
ever
was
any
intrigue
between
mrs
gerrarde
and
me
i
do
not
however
pretend
to
vouch
for
her
chastity
it
was
no
secret
at
v
hall
that
she
had
occasioned
an
unhappy
breach
in
mr
family
and
that
and
that
as
i
have
a
most
particular
value
and
affection
for
that
family
was
my
motive
to
the
carrying
this
lady
away
as
i
hope
the
disunion
now
the
cause
of
it
is
removed
will
no
longer
subsist
i
find
it
necessary
to
provide
for
mrs
gerrarde
some
way
or
other
a
good
husband
i
would
wish
to
bestow
on
her
i
do
not
yet
know
whether
i
shall
be
able
to
bring
her
into
any
measures
but
if
she
should
be
prevailed
on
to
accept
of
you
and
i
should
make
it
worth
your
while
to
accept
of
her
can
you
overlook
the
levity
she
has
been
guilty
of
and
resolve
to
use
her
kindly
he
promised
he
would
make
the
best
husband
in
the
universe
i
bid
him
not
be
too
sure
of
success
as
i
did
not
yet
know
mrs
mind
and
feared
i
should
find
it
hard
to
bring
her
into
terms
adding
that
though
i
intended
to
threaten
her
i
should
be
very
unwilling
to
make
use
of
compulsion
but
if
she
should
happen
to
like
him
without
suspecting
my
design
i
might
accomplish
my
purpose
with
less
reluctance
on
her
side
and
much
more
satisfaction
to
myself
the
conversation
he
had
just
had
with
her
elated
him
highly
she
had
made
him
her
confidant
she
had
implored
his
assistance
she
had
promised
an
gratitude
she
had
prohibited
visits
and
invited
all
this
facilitated
my
work
and
i
at
one
time
thought
of
letting
her
work
out
her
fate
and
run
blindfold
into
my
trap
for
it
is
plain
if
pivet
had
given
in
to
it
she
would
have
marched
off
with
him
and
even
married
him
to
get
out
of
my
clutches
and
then
you
know
she
could
have
blamed
nobody
but
herself
for
the
consequences
but
i
resolved
not
to
impose
on
the
gypsey
any
farther
but
let
her
know
what
she
was
to
expect
before
the
bargain
was
concluded
and
at
least
give
her
her
option
of
having
the
power
of
continuing
a
jilt
or
being
canonized
for
a
saint
i
found
things
were
now
likely
to
take
such
a
turn
as
i
wished
but
it
still
required
management
pivet
said
i
you
must
let
her
see
you
no
more
it
will
make
her
prize
your
company
the
more
keep
out
of
the
way
that
you
may
not
be
seen
by
rachael
and
give
such
orders
in
the
house
as
that
there
may
be
proper
attendance
for
the
lady
one
of
my
footmen
spoke
a
little
french
and
he
had
been
directed
to
receive
and
communicate
mrs
rachael
orders
in
the
family
tho
pivet
assured
me
that
he
thought
mrs
gerrarde
was
not
so
ill
as
she
said
she
was
i
yet
thought
it
incumbent
on
me
to
have
the
advice
of
a
physician
the
people
with
whom
i
lodged
said
i
could
not
have
a
better
than
the
doctor
who
had
attended
me
as
he
was
reckoned
very
skilful
i
told
them
in
the
present
case
i
believed
honesty
was
more
requisite
than
skill
they
said
he
was
very
honest
too
so
i
desired
he
might
be
sent
for
mrs
gerrarde
being
determined
to
carry
on
the
farce
of
sickness
pretended
she
was
not
able
to
rise
and
the
doctor
was
introduced
to
her
bedside
as
he
could
neither
understand
his
patient
nor
make
himself
understood
by
her
i
had
ordered
the
footman
whom
i
mentioned
to
you
before
as
knowing
a
little
french
to
wait
at
the
chamber
door
for
i
was
resolved
so
far
to
keep
up
my
resentment
and
my
importance
as
not
to
assisting
at
the
conference
which
by
this
means
became
the
most
ridiculous
scene
you
can
imagine
the
doctor
having
felt
mrs
gerrarde
pulse
proposed
his
questions
by
the
footman
who
just
peeped
his
nose
in
at
the
door
he
explained
them
very
ill
i
suppose
to
rachael
in
english
who
them
to
her
lady
within
her
curtains
for
she
would
not
suffer
them
to
be
drawn
back
mrs
gerrarde
answers
travelled
the
same
way
back
to
the
doctor
who
got
them
mangled
in
very
bad
french
from
his
interpreter
mrs
gerrarde
provoked
i
believe
at
the
doctor
visit
and
very
much
tired
of
his
questions
asked
peevishly
where
monsieur
pivet
was
this
inquiry
i
expected
and
the
fellow
who
told
me
of
it
had
been
ordered
to
inform
her
that
monsieur
pivet
was
not
at
home
the
doctor
after
leaving
his
patient
came
to
me
and
confirmed
the
character
i
had
received
of
him
both
for
skill
in
his
profession
and
integrity
in
his
practice
for
he
told
me
very
honestly
that
he
thought
the
lady
was
in
perfect
health
i
thought
the
doctor
deserved
a
double
fee
and
accordingly
gave
it
to
him
requesting
him
however
to
continue
his
visits
for
i
told
him
that
though
the
lady
might
really
be
very
well
she
was
however
a
little
vapourish
i
left
her
to
her
reflections
the
whole
day
rachael
inquired
three
or
four
times
of
the
footman
if
mr
pivet
was
come
in
but
was
always
answered
in
the
negative
i
was
pleased
at
her
sollicitude
about
him
i
desired
him
to
wait
on
her
the
next
day
at
the
time
the
doctor
paid
his
visit
and
instructed
pivet
to
ask
the
doctor
in
her
presence
what
he
thought
of
her
case
and
to
report
his
answer
fairly
to
her
for
i
was
resolved
not
to
let
her
imagine
that
she
imposed
on
me
the
doctor
by
pivet
means
discoursed
with
her
more
readily
than
he
had
done
the
day
before
pivet
asked
his
opinion
of
her
disorder
and
the
physician
declared
it
as
freely
as
he
had
done
to
me
adding
he
should
not
have
repeated
his
visit
if
i
had
not
insisted
on
it
pivet
could
not
help
smiling
mrs
gerrarde
observed
it
for
i
suppose
she
watched
his
countenance
and
asked
him
what
the
doctor
had
said
he
says
madam
what
gives
me
a
vast
deal
of
pleasure
which
is
that
your
disorder
is
intirely
imaginary
he
is
an
ignorant
fellow
said
mrs
gerrarde
and
you
may
tell
him
i
desire
to
see
him
no
more
the
poor
doctor
who
knew
not
what
she
said
made
her
half
a
dozen
scrapes
and
withdrew
she
then
threw
back
her
curtain
and
the
subject
she
had
been
upon
the
day
before
with
pivet
asked
him
if
he
had
had
any
conversation
with
me
about
her
and
what
resolution
i
had
come
to
pivet
who
had
begged
i
would
leave
this
conference
intirely
to
his
management
seemed
to
hesitate
a
little
and
appeared
melancholy
we
have
had
some
talk
about
you
madam
said
he
and
mr
faulkland
tells
me
if
you
reject
the
nunnery
scheme
which
i
think
seems
to
be
fondest
of
that
he
has
a
person
in
his
thoughts
who
he
believes
will
be
a
suitable
match
for
you
if
you
are
willing
to
accept
of
him
if
not
here
he
stop
what
if
i
should
not
sir
pray
speak
i
hope
madam
he
will
not
carry
matters
to
an
extremity
extremity
sir
do
you
think
he
can
be
brutal
enough
to
force
me
into
a
nunnery
are
there
no
laws
in
france
i
he
will
not
madam
but
i
ca
pretend
to
answer
for
him
he
is
a
strange
man
he
seems
out
of
temper
too
the
doctor
told
him
nothing
ailed
you
he
believes
him
and
spoke
harshly
on
the
occasion
and
what
said
she
is
the
match
that
he
calls
one
of
his
footmen
perhaps
or
his
barber
pivet
affected
to
look
concerned
he
tells
me
madam
he
has
cast
his
eyes
on
a
young
man
well
born
and
genteelly
educated
not
contemptible
in
his
personal
accomplishments
and
one
who
he
is
sure
will
make
you
a
fond
and
obliging
husband
pivet
sighed
deeply
and
cast
his
eyes
languishingly
on
her
you
seem
concerned
sir
said
she
do
you
know
the
person
it
is
my
doubts
on
that
occasion
madam
that
is
the
cause
of
my
uneasiness
pray
explain
yourself
mr
pivet
madam
i
dare
not
he
replied
with
great
solemnity
i
will
only
assure
you
that
whoever
the
person
be
whom
mr
faulkland
has
not
yet
named
to
me
i
think
him
the
happiest
man
in
the
world
what
can
be
his
meaning
asked
mrs
gerrarde
for
telling
you
much
and
yet
concealing
the
person
name
he
says
he
has
not
proposed
it
yet
to
the
gentleman
madam
and
as
he
tells
me
he
ca
in
honour
conceal
any
part
of
your
story
he
is
fearful
i
beg
your
pardon
madam
you
will
excuse
me
if
i
do
not
repeat
his
scruples
on
this
occasion
i
understand
you
sir
he
supposes
his
friend
will
reject
me
some
such
insinuation
he
threw
out
madam
said
pivet
i
told
him
that
he
need
only
permit
the
gentleman
to
you
and
if
he
then
made
any
objection
he
must
be
the
blindest
and
most
insensible
man
alive
he
spoke
this
with
a
warmth
that
seemed
highly
pleasing
to
the
lady
she
bowed
and
answered
men
sir
are
not
as
generous
as
you
but
what
did
mr
faulkland
say
to
this
he
only
smiled
and
said
he
wished
his
friend
might
think
as
i
did
that
he
would
tell
me
his
name
another
time
and
that
in
the
mean
time
it
would
oblige
him
if
my
visits
to
you
were
less
frequent
inhuman
monster
said
she
would
he
debar
me
of
the
only
satisfaction
i
have
let
me
but
live
to
get
out
of
his
hands
if
i
can
escape
him
by
any
means
i
will
find
ways
to
reckon
with
him
for
this
be
so
good
mr
pivet
to
tell
him
that
i
am
content
to
take
the
person
he
offers
let
him
be
who
he
will
i
shall
expect
nothing
from
him
but
insults
therefore
shall
not
be
surprized
if
i
see
myself
sacrificed
to
some
despicable
wretch
but
any
thing
is
better
than
to
be
in
the
power
of
such
a
tyrant
madam
answered
pivet
you
need
not
fear
the
being
compelled
to
accept
of
an
unworthy
object
mr
faulkland
declares
that
if
you
should
absolutely
dislike
the
gentleman
when
you
see
him
he
will
be
far
from
constraining
you
to
take
him
for
your
husband
the
other
choice
is
still
open
to
you
and
by
what
i
can
judge
mr
faulkland
seems
to
wish
you
would
give
that
the
preference
i
would
die
first
cried
mrs
gerrarde
the
fool
does
he
think
i
can
be
so
entrapped
no
no
the
authority
of
a
husband
even
of
faulkland
chusing
can
not
be
such
a
bar
to
my
revenge
as
the
walls
of
a
nunnery
would
sir
i
think
myself
obliged
to
you
and
flatter
myself
you
would
have
served
me
if
you
could
i
may
yet
have
it
in
my
power
to
make
you
a
return
for
your
kind
intentions
towards
me
i
presume
when
mr
faulkland
has
disposed
of
his
property
you
will
then
be
absolved
of
your
promise
to
him
in
regard
to
me
and
will
still
have
charity
enough
to
befriend
an
unfortunate
woman
she
wept
and
pivet
owned
he
was
ready
to
do
so
too
but
constraining
himself
protested
she
should
command
his
life
and
withdrew
full
of
seeming
uneasiness
he
told
me
what
had
passed
between
him
and
the
lady
and
i
could
not
help
approving
his
management
of
the
scene
though
the
rogue
had
stretched
beyond
the
truth
but
stratagems
you
know
are
allowable
in
love
and
a
lover
he
was
now
become
in
good
earnest
he
had
taken
care
to
alarm
mrs
gerrarde
apprehensions
at
every
passage
of
access
he
had
informed
her
that
i
had
a
husband
for
her
in
my
thoughts
and
at
the
same
time
that
he
avoided
the
most
distant
hint
of
its
being
himself
he
engaged
her
favour
by
seeming
to
wish
it
then
he
took
care
to
insinuate
at
least
a
possibility
of
her
being
refused
by
the
person
designed
for
her
and
this
he
very
naturally
supposed
would
raise
his
own
consequence
with
her
in
case
any
suspicion
should
fall
on
him
of
his
being
the
intended
husband
he
pretended
i
had
taken
umbrage
at
his
visiting
her
still
more
to
inflame
her
resentment
against
me
and
increase
her
impatience
to
deliver
herself
out
of
my
hands
at
the
same
time
he
artfully
hinted
that
he
was
not
the
man
destined
to
be
happy
this
as
he
saw
already
he
was
not
unacceptable
to
her
he
thought
would
make
him
doubly
welcome
when
she
should
find
herself
no
worse
off
then
the
nunnery
was
mentioned
in
terrorem
with
broad
hints
of
my
resolution
in
short
pivet
played
his
part
so
cunningly
that
it
had
all
the
effect
he
could
have
wished
and
mrs
gerrarde
finding
her
spirit
matched
was
obliged
to
surrender
at
discretion
i
own
i
did
not
expect
to
have
succeeded
so
soon
and
without
pivet
who
had
now
a
feeling
in
the
affair
i
certainly
should
not
i
resolved
directly
to
make
the
best
use
of
the
advantage
i
had
gained
i
told
pivet
that
he
should
be
married
the
next
day
he
was
so
transported
at
the
thought
that
he
begged
i
would
give
him
leave
to
go
to
mrs
gerrarde
to
declare
his
love
and
his
good
fortune
together
for
sir
said
he
you
know
she
promises
to
accept
of
whomsoever
you
propose
and
i
hope
she
will
not
dispise
your
choice
so
much
as
she
thinks
she
shall
softly
softly
good
monsieur
pivet
your
violent
hurry
will
spoil
all
i
do
not
mean
that
you
shall
see
her
till
not
till
ah
sir
do
i
beseech
you
sir
allow
me
she
will
think
it
very
cruel
poor
pivet
thought
i
thou
wilt
have
enough
of
her
simpleton
to
him
this
day
suspence
will
forward
your
business
more
than
all
you
could
say
to
her
in
seven
hours
is
it
not
enough
you
are
sure
of
her
we
have
other
things
now
to
mind
what
plan
of
life
do
you
purpose
to
pursue
you
know
i
have
promised
to
do
handsomely
for
you
sir
said
he
i
always
intended
to
follow
the
business
i
was
bred
to
and
if
this
piece
of
extraordinary
good
fortune
had
happened
to
me
i
did
purpose
tho
you
have
been
the
best
of
masters
to
me
to
have
asked
your
permission
to
return
to
my
friends
in
order
to
settle
in
my
trade
as
i
have
some
capital
of
my
own
but
to
be
sure
sir
i
shall
be
directed
in
this
as
in
every
thing
else
by
your
will
and
pleasure
i
approve
of
your
design
intirely
said
i
but
there
are
certain
conditions
that
must
be
previously
settled
between
you
and
me
in
the
first
place
tell
me
honestly
what
is
the
capital
you
say
you
are
worth
he
answered
his
father
had
left
him
about
eight
thousand
livres
which
were
in
the
hands
of
a
banker
in
paris
whom
he
named
to
me
and
referred
me
to
him
for
confirmation
of
the
truth
of
what
he
told
me
well
said
i
this
will
go
a
good
way
towards
setting
you
up
in
your
own
business
where
do
you
think
of
settling
he
answered
paris
was
the
best
place
for
his
trade
on
that
i
put
an
absolute
negative
i
said
paris
was
too
much
frequented
by
my
countrymen
to
be
a
proper
place
for
mrs
gerrarde
to
make
her
appearance
in
as
she
was
likely
to
meet
there
with
more
of
her
acquaintance
than
might
be
convenient
i
told
him
i
had
no
objection
to
any
other
large
provincial
town
he
said
he
was
born
at
dijon
and
should
like
to
go
thither
as
he
had
many
friends
there
be
it
so
said
i
what
i
purpose
doing
for
you
is
this
mrs
gerrarde
has
eight
hundred
pounds
of
her
own
i
will
add
as
much
more
to
it
for
which
i
will
give
you
my
bond
till
i
can
have
the
money
remitted
from
england
and
this
you
shall
settle
on
her
that
she
may
be
sure
of
a
support
in
case
of
your
death
and
the
interest
you
shall
allow
her
for
her
own
separate
use
but
without
her
knowing
that
you
are
tied
down
to
it
that
you
may
have
it
in
your
power
to
oblige
her
he
made
no
reply
but
acquiesced
with
a
low
bow
i
laughed
at
the
simplicity
of
his
countenance
pivet
said
i
though
i
have
taken
care
of
mrs
gerrarde
interest
i
do
not
intend
to
neglect
yours
provided
you
make
no
demur
to
the
terms
you
already
know
my
reasons
for
proceeding
as
i
have
done
in
this
affair
i
have
great
cause
to
apprehend
mrs
gerrarde
vindictive
spirit
if
she
should
find
means
which
i
know
she
will
endeavour
at
to
lay
open
the
real
state
of
this
transaction
to
some
people
in
england
this
might
frustrate
all
that
i
have
been
at
so
much
pains
to
accomplish
be
it
your
care
then
to
prevent
it
i
can
not
wish
you
to
use
harsh
measures
with
your
wife
but
if
you
have
address
enough
to
prevent
a
correspondence
with
any
one
in
england
an
elopement
for
both
your
sakes
i
am
not
willing
to
suppose
though
i
think
for
some
time
at
least
you
must
keep
a
strict
eye
over
her
if
as
i
said
you
can
prevent
a
correspondence
i
think
it
will
answer
my
purpose
and
that
i
may
make
it
your
interest
to
do
this
i
will
bind
myself
by
as
strong
an
obligation
as
the
law
can
make
to
pay
you
two
hundred
pounds
a
year
english
so
long
as
you
keep
your
wife
within
the
bounds
prescribed
provided
if
after
three
years
i
find
those
terms
no
longer
necessary
they
shall
if
i
then
chuse
it
become
void
i
shall
also
add
something
to
enable
you
to
fit
up
a
house
and
a
shop
that
you
need
not
be
under
a
necessity
of
breaking
in
upon
your
capital
pivet
gratitude
overflowed
at
his
lips
for
this
as
he
called
it
noble
provision
he
said
he
made
no
doubt
of
gaining
so
far
upon
mrs
gerrarde
affections
as
to
be
able
effectually
to
fulfil
his
covenant
without
using
violent
methods
but
said
he
at
all
events
i
warrant
you
shall
hear
no
more
of
her
preliminaries
thus
adjusted
i
sent
for
a
notary
of
reputation
to
whom
i
gave
instructions
to
draw
up
two
separate
articles
for
the
purposes
mentioned
the
latter
was
to
be
a
secret
between
pivet
and
me
as
it
was
by
no
means
proper
for
mrs
gerrarde
to
be
let
into
it
the
other
which
regarded
her
own
particular
settlement
was
intended
for
her
perusal
and
approbation
i
charged
the
notary
to
use
dispatch
and
he
promised
to
have
both
the
papers
ready
by
next
morning
as
also
the
bond
which
i
was
to
give
pivet
for
the
payment
of
eight
hundred
pounds
the
lawyer
brought
the
papers
according
to
his
promise
and
they
were
signed
sealed
and
delivered
in
due
form
that
which
was
to
be
the
private
agreement
between
pivet
and
me
was
worded
in
consequence
of
an
article
which
i
drew
up
myself
and
made
pivet
sign
wherein
i
set
forth
particulars
at
large
pivet
was
very
impatient
to
see
his
beloved
but
a
little
uneasy
lest
she
should
be
disgusted
with
him
when
she
should
come
to
know
the
situation
he
had
been
in
i
bid
him
not
be
discouraged
telling
him
i
should
set
off
that
circumstance
of
his
having
been
my
gentleman
for
so
i
chose
to
call
him
in
the
most
favourable
light
i
presented
him
with
a
very
elegant
suit
of
cloaths
which
i
had
never
worn
and
which
fitted
him
very
well
as
you
know
he
is
nearly
my
size
you
can
not
imagine
how
handsome
the
fellow
looked
when
he
was
dressed
for
he
had
linnen
and
every
thing
else
suitable
to
his
cloaths
i
then
desired
him
to
wait
on
his
goddess
but
he
who
had
been
so
eager
a
little
before
was
now
quite
abashed
at
the
thoughts
of
making
his
pretensions
known
to
the
lady
and
intreated
me
to
present
him
to
her
i
saw
he
was
quite
disconcerted
at
the
serious
scene
he
was
going
to
engage
in
i
pitied
him
and
told
him
i
would
go
with
him
to
mrs
gerrarde
but
that
it
was
proper
first
to
prepare
her
a
little
he
said
he
thought
so
too
i
immediately
sent
for
rachael
and
speaking
to
her
at
the
door
without
letting
her
see
pivet
i
bid
her
tell
her
mistress
that
i
purposed
making
her
a
visit
in
half
an
hour
and
should
introduce
the
gentleman
whom
i
expected
she
would
according
to
her
promise
receive
at
my
hands
for
her
husband
reserving
to
herself
still
the
liberty
of
chusing
the
other
alternative
in
case
she
disliked
him
pivet
shewed
the
sollicitude
of
a
lover
after
this
message
was
sent
to
his
mistress
poor
dear
lady
said
he
how
i
pity
her
what
must
she
suffer
in
this
interval
but
your
presence
monsieur
pivet
said
i
will
dispel
all
her
fears
and
make
her
the
happiest
of
women
the
poor
fellow
was
out
of
countenance
and
i
dare
say
as
anxious
as
mrs
gerrarde
as
i
received
no
answer
from
her
to
my
message
i
construed
her
silence
as
leave
to
attend
her
and
accordingly
at
the
appointed
time
i
entered
her
apartment
leading
pivet
by
the
hand
she
was
sitting
at
a
table
leaning
her
head
on
one
of
her
hands
she
cast
a
look
of
scorn
at
me
and
immediately
withdrew
her
eyes
not
so
much
as
deigning
to
glance
them
at
pivet
little
imagining
that
it
was
who
accompanied
me
though
she
knew
it
was
her
intended
bridegroom
pivet
was
not
able
to
speak
he
trembled
and
like
a
true
inamorato
ran
to
her
clapt
one
knee
to
the
ground
and
ventured
though
with
great
diffidence
to
take
one
of
her
hands
this
action
obliged
the
haughty
fair
one
to
vouchsafe
him
a
glance
at
her
eye
her
surprize
spite
of
her
assumed
airs
of
grandeur
was
not
to
be
concealed
it
was
apparent
she
coloured
and
though
she
intended
to
have
been
solemn
and
lofty
she
even
and
i
could
discover
a
little
gleam
of
pleasure
dance
over
her
countenance
what
monsieur
pivet
and
then
she
looked
at
me
as
if
for
an
explanation
yes
madam
said
i
monsieur
pivet
the
man
i
was
going
to
say
the
man
but
i
did
not
mean
to
compliment
her
my
business
was
to
make
her
think
i
was
doing
her
a
favour
it
has
been
your
good
fortune
to
make
a
conquest
of
him
and
in
the
hope
of
your
making
him
a
good
wife
as
i
am
sure
he
will
make
you
a
good
husband
i
have
consented
to
the
match
and
i
spoke
this
in
the
tone
of
one
who
thinking
he
has
conferred
a
great
obligation
on
an
undeserving
object
expects
to
be
thanked
for
it
the
woman
with
all
her
art
and
assurance
to
boot
was
quite
confounded
i
did
not
give
her
time
to
recover
herself
but
taking
the
settlement
out
of
my
pocket
and
reading
it
to
her
look
there
madam
and
see
if
i
have
injured
you
in
the
disposal
of
your
person
and
your
fortune
mrs
gerrarde
always
alert
when
her
interest
was
in
the
question
took
the
paper
and
notwithstanding
her
confusion
read
it
entirely
over
pivet
handsome
appearance
joined
to
her
former
prepossessions
had
made
so
good
an
impression
on
her
that
she
began
to
think
the
matter
worth
attending
to
when
she
had
read
the
paper
she
put
it
into
pivet
hands
sir
said
she
it
should
appear
by
this
that
you
have
acted
generously
but
as
i
have
already
been
imposed
upon
by
that
gentleman
looking
at
me
all
this
may
for
ought
i
know
be
a
deceit
but
as
it
is
not
in
my
power
to
make
terms
for
myself
it
is
to
no
purpose
for
me
to
make
objections
or
to
enquire
any
farther
i
am
ready
to
accept
your
offer
only
i
should
be
glad
to
know
who
the
man
is
that
i
am
to
make
my
husband
she
spoke
this
with
such
an
air
of
disdain
that
the
poor
lover
shrunk
up
and
diminished
in
his
own
eyes
left
me
to
make
an
answer
mrs
gerrarde
said
i
i
declare
to
you
solemnly
that
there
is
no
deception
in
any
thing
which
you
see
nor
any
foul
play
meant
to
you
this
young
man
whom
i
now
present
to
you
for
your
husband
is
well
born
and
has
many
genteel
relations
in
this
country
he
has
it
in
his
power
to
my
certain
knowlege
to
make
good
the
settlement
he
proposes
for
you
which
i
will
take
care
to
see
properly
secured
that
part
of
it
which
is
your
own
property
you
have
now
in
your
possession
the
other
half
i
know
is
his
he
was
brought
up
to
a
creditable
business
which
he
intends
to
follow
i
know
him
to
be
good
natured
and
of
an
obliging
temper
he
lived
with
me
some
time
and
accompanied
me
in
my
travels
i
suppose
his
having
been
my
gentleman
which
station
he
did
not
accept
through
necessity
will
not
be
a
material
objection
and
i
smiled
and
affected
to
look
very
proud
and
i
only
mention
it
to
convince
you
that
i
have
no
design
of
deceiving
you
or
concealing
any
part
of
his
character
pivet
coloured
for
i
stole
a
side
glance
at
him
and
looked
sheepish
he
began
an
aukward
compliment
with
a
bow
and
hope
madam
but
i
relieved
him
and
speaking
to
mrs
gerrarde
you
know
all
now
madam
that
can
be
known
therefore
if
you
are
disposed
to
keep
your
word
let
us
put
an
end
to
this
business
sir
yes
madam
what
occasion
is
there
for
farther
delay
pivet
now
plucked
up
his
courage
and
begged
since
she
had
consented
that
she
would
not
defer
his
happiness
i
told
her
between
mirth
and
chiding
that
i
was
in
haste
to
get
rid
of
my
charge
and
was
therefore
determined
to
make
her
over
to
mr
pivet
that
evening
and
telling
her
i
would
give
orders
about
the
ceremony
left
the
lovers
to
make
out
for
themselves
a
scheme
of
conjugal
felicity
pivet
pleaded
his
own
cause
so
effectually
that
in
the
evening
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
bestowing
with
my
own
hand
that
inestimable
treasure
of
virtue
and
meekness
mrs
gerrarde
on
my
faithful
squire
monsieur
pivet
to
the
no
small
joy
of
the
latter
and
i
believe
if
the
truth
were
known
to
the
no
great
mortification
of
the
former
mrs
rachael
and
myself
were
the
only
witnesses
of
this
illustrious
union
when
the
ceremony
was
over
i
approached
according
to
custom
to
congratulate
and
salute
the
bride
but
she
turned
her
saucy
cheek
to
me
and
affected
the
whole
night
vast
dignity
of
behaviour
yet
it
was
so
foreign
to
her
nature
that
it
appeared
ridiculous
however
it
was
better
than
ranting
i
invited
them
both
to
sup
with
me
and
treated
pivet
with
a
familiar
civility
that
seemed
to
please
him
highly
as
it
did
him
credit
in
the
presence
of
his
lady
after
supper
pivet
entreated
me
to
complete
the
friendly
and
generous
offices
i
had
already
done
him
by
undertaking
the
settlement
of
all
money
matters
for
him
as
he
knew
i
intended
to
go
to
paris
he
begged
i
would
receive
for
him
the
sum
he
had
in
the
hands
of
the
banker
which
he
said
if
i
would
remit
to
him
it
would
enable
him
to
enter
upon
his
business
immediately
at
the
same
time
he
with
no
ill
grace
presented
me
my
bond
again
assuring
me
he
relied
entirely
upon
my
honour
for
the
execution
of
my
promise
to
him
farther
requesting
that
i
would
put
that
together
with
mrs
gerrarde
money
if
she
approved
of
it
into
such
hands
as
i
should
judge
most
proper
for
her
advantage
i
was
pleased
at
the
openness
of
his
proceedings
and
promised
to
do
every
thing
for
their
mutual
satisfaction
but
insisted
on
his
keeping
the
bond
or
lodging
it
in
some
proper
hand
till
i
could
redeem
it
by
paying
the
money
which
i
should
take
care
should
be
speedily
done
i
told
him
i
thought
the
sooner
he
set
out
for
his
own
province
the
better
he
said
he
should
be
ready
the
next
day
if
mrs
gerrarde
for
he
did
not
yet
presume
to
call
her
by
his
name
did
not
object
to
it
he
appealed
to
her
with
his
looks
she
had
scarce
condescended
to
open
her
lips
before
but
now
answered
you
may
be
sure
sir
i
shall
not
think
it
too
soon
to
get
out
of
a
prison
he
asked
her
if
she
chose
to
take
her
maid
rachael
along
with
her
certainly
she
said
i
should
not
be
fond
of
having
a
servant
about
me
by
whom
i
should
not
be
understood
rachael
was
now
called
in
and
the
thing
proposed
to
her
she
seemed
rather
inclined
to
return
to
england
but
i
told
her
she
could
not
in
gratitude
desert
her
lady
in
a
strange
country
and
that
if
she
had
a
mind
to
make
me
her
friend
which
she
should
find
me
upon
any
future
occasion
she
would
attend
her
home
and
continue
with
her
till
her
mistress
was
willing
to
part
with
her
the
girl
upon
this
consented
to
stay
and
received
mrs
orders
to
prepare
for
their
departure
the
next
day
in
the
morning
i
made
pivet
a
present
for
his
travelling
charges
and
rachael
another
telling
her
according
to
the
account
i
had
of
her
behaviour
that
i
would
be
kind
to
her
she
made
me
all
the
promises
that
i
could
desire
assuring
me
that
it
was
purely
to
oblige
me
that
she
staid
with
mrs
gerrarde
pivet
told
me
that
he
would
send
the
sum
which
his
wife
had
in
bills
to
me
to
be
appropriated
in
the
manner
agreed
on
for
he
said
that
having
that
morning
mentioned
to
her
my
generosity
in
relation
to
the
bond
she
had
owned
that
notwithstanding
her
resentment
to
me
she
had
no
distrust
of
my
honour
in
particulars
i
took
this
opportunity
of
telling
pivet
that
when
he
could
get
his
wife
in
the
humour
he
might
prevail
on
her
to
give
an
instrument
impowering
my
steward
to
receive
the
little
income
of
her
jointure
at
ashby
which
i
would
take
care
should
be
remitted
to
him
for
trifling
as
it
was
it
might
be
serviceable
when
they
were
ready
to
set
forward
on
their
journey
i
begged
leave
to
speak
a
few
words
to
madam
pivet
by
herself
she
seemed
not
inclined
to
the
conference
but
her
husband
very
obligingly
pressing
her
not
to
part
with
me
in
enmity
and
at
the
same
time
quitting
the
room
she
was
obliged
to
hear
me
i
then
very
frankly
asked
her
pardon
for
the
lengths
i
had
gone
telling
her
that
i
hoped
time
and
her
own
good
sense
would
convince
her
that
she
was
more
obliged
to
me
than
her
passion
would
then
give
her
leave
to
see
remember
madam
i
have
kept
my
word
with
you
you
are
now
married
to
a
very
deserving
young
man
you
have
a
competent
support
during
your
life
happiness
is
in
your
power
if
you
do
not
wilfully
cast
it
away
from
you
shew
now
that
greatness
of
mind
of
which
you
have
so
often
boasted
by
forgiving
the
man
who
has
as
you
think
injured
you
and
resolving
at
once
on
a
behaviour
that
shall
in
your
turn
intitle
you
not
only
to
the
forgiveness
but
even
to
the
esteem
of
those
whom
you
have
injured
i
would
have
preached
on
and
given
her
more
good
advice
but
she
cut
me
short
with
this
decisive
answer
sir
i
neither
desire
your
counsel
nor
your
good
opinion
mr
pivet
deserve
some
regard
from
me
but
i
will
never
forgive
and
she
flung
from
me
i
called
in
pivet
and
telling
him
i
was
infinitely
pleased
at
the
good
disposition
i
found
his
lady
in
i
wished
him
all
happiness
and
a
safe
journey
and
they
set
out
directly
for
dijon
and
now
my
dear
bidulph
stop
to
praise
to
admire
to
wonder
at
my
virtue
i
who
have
had
one
of
the
finest
women
in
england
in
my
possession
for
so
many
days
and
by
the
way
was
not
her
aversion
to
yield
up
her
by
me
unpolluted
charms
to
the
arms
of
another
add
to
this
that
it
has
cost
me
more
to
make
one
woman
honest
than
it
need
have
done
to
have
made
half
a
dozen
otherwise
i
had
like
to
have
writ
a
strange
ugly
word
that
was
just
at
the
nib
of
my
pen
if
you
relate
my
story
with
the
laudable
partiality
of
a
friend
judiciously
abolishing
the
context
for
which
you
may
have
many
precedents
and
neatly
splicing
together
the
useful
fragments
shall
i
not
appear
to
posterity
as
great
as
scipio
himself
ah
sir
george
if
we
knew
the
secret
springs
of
many
of
those
actions
which
dazzle
us
in
the
histories
of
the
renowned
heroes
of
old
it
is
not
impossible
but
the
wonderous
page
might
dwindle
into
as
insignificant
a
tale
as
mine
is
well
i
thank
my
good
genius
that
has
led
me
safely
through
such
a
labyrinth
as
i
had
got
into
in
getting
rid
of
that
woman
and
not
disgracefully
neither
i
feel
as
if
i
had
shaken
off
a
great
load
but
what
a
graceless
baggage
it
is
not
to
thank
me
for
my
kindness
i
who
have
been
more
than
a
father
to
her
in
saving
her
first
from
perdition
and
then
settling
her
well
in
the
world
but
there
is
no
obliging
some
tempers
i
shall
leave
this
place
for
i
must
hasten
to
paris
to
put
every
thing
on
a
good
footing
for
the
pair
and
then
i
will
go
and
ramble
i
do
not
care
whither
for
another
year
i
shall
lodge
at
paris
where
i
did
before
and
desire
you
will
write
to
me
directly
an
account
of
all
that
passes
within
the
circle
of
your
family
let
your
sister
and
my
lady
bidulph
know
in
what
manner
i
have
disposed
of
mrs
gerrarde
but
be
sure
you
do
it
discreetly
and
take
care
not
to
mention
that
paultry
circumstance
of
her
settlement
or
any
other
private
agreement
with
pivet
i
know
mrs
arnold
delicacy
would
be
hurt
by
the
knowlege
of
this
therefore
beware
of
dropping
the
least
hint
of
it
at
your
peril
tell
lady
bidulph
i
will
pray
devoutly
for
her
daughter
happiness
if
what
i
have
done
will
promote
it
it
will
not
a
little
contribute
to
my
own
tho
i
begin
to
feel
it
is
not
to
be
expected
in
this
life
at
least
by
such
a
hopeless
wanderer
as
i
am
i
could
sit
now
and
indite
melancholy
verses
or
write
an
elegy
or
make
my
will
or
do
any
other
splenetic
thing
in
short
i
have
a
good
mind
to
turn
monk
and
go
into
a
monastery
i
am
sure
i
should
have
lady
bidulph
vote
for
that
adieu
my
dear
bidulph
you
will
not
hear
from
me
again
perhaps
till
i
am
in
another
region
what
a
strange
man
this
is
my
cecilia
the
more
i
reflect
on
his
conduct
the
more
i
am
amazed
what
a
mixture
is
there
in
his
nature
wild
to
a
romantic
degree
in
his
conceptions
yet
how
steady
how
resolute
how
consistent
in
putting
those
flights
of
fancy
into
act
generous
he
certainly
is
how
few
men
would
put
themselves
to
the
trouble
and
expence
that
he
has
done
from
such
a
disinterested
such
a
compassionate
motive
nay
on
the
contrary
i
believe
most
men
would
be
cruel
enough
to
take
a
sort
of
pleasure
in
the
vexation
of
a
man
who
had
succeeded
to
the
love
of
a
mistress
once
so
much
valued
and
would
enjoy
a
mean
triumph
in
being
though
without
reason
the
object
of
jealousy
who
had
cut
them
off
from
all
hope
mr
faulkland
is
above
this
i
think
myself
highly
indebted
to
him
whether
the
scheme
he
has
in
so
extraordinary
a
manner
undertaken
for
my
service
succeeds
or
not
yet
do
i
wish
from
my
heart
that
the
separation
between
mr
arnold
and
mrs
gerrarde
had
been
brought
about
by
any
other
means
what
if
mr
arnold
should
ever
come
at
the
truth
though
i
think
that
hardly
possible
might
it
not
leave
him
more
estranged
from
me
than
he
is
even
now
or
if
he
should
in
consequence
of
this
odd
adventure
return
to
his
poor
banished
wife
repent
of
his
injurious
suspicions
of
her
and
restore
her
to
his
confidence
and
love
can
he
can
he
ever
restore
to
her
that
peace
she
has
so
long
been
a
stranger
to
will
no
latent
sparks
of
former
unkindness
ever
rekindle
and
light
up
the
fire
of
discord
how
unwillingly
do
we
repair
the
unprovoked
injuries
which
we
find
we
have
done
to
others
poor
mr
arnold
if
i
am
so
happy
as
to
have
my
innocence
cleared
to
him
how
miserable
will
his
own
reflections
make
him
but
if
he
convinced
which
has
been
my
daily
and
hourly
prayers
he
not
be
unhappy
if
i
can
make
him
otherwise
oh
my
dear
it
is
the
wish
the
ardent
longing
of
my
soul
to
recover
the
esteem
though
i
lose
the
love
of
mr
arnold
for
i
call
that
being
to
witness
who
knows
the
secrets
of
all
hearts
that
since
i
have
been
his
wife
i
have
never
even
in
thought
swerved
from
that
perfect
and
inviolable
fidelity
which
i
vowed
to
him
what
then
must
have
been
my
sufferings
deprived
of
his
love
cast
out
from
his
house
and
branded
with
the
dreadful
name
of
an
adultress
for
where
is
the
difference
between
the
intention
and
the
act
to
me
there
is
no
distinction
and
the
husband
must
be
gross
that
makes
one
my
mother
has
suffered
me
to
tell
her
the
substance
of
mr
letters
though
she
would
not
read
them
i
own
i
was
better
satisfied
that
she
should
receive
her
information
thus
because
his
light
manner
of
expressing
himself
in
many
places
would
have
given
her
great
offence
sir
george
did
not
consider
this
when
he
submitted
the
letters
to
my
mother
as
well
as
my
perusal
many
grave
animadversions
did
she
make
during
my
recital
and
many
times
lift
up
her
eyes
in
wonder
at
mrs
gerrarde
behaviour
she
often
said
mr
faulkland
was
frantic
to
undertake
such
a
thing
and
wished
he
had
not
taken
such
a
woman
in
hand
when
i
came
to
that
part
of
the
account
where
mrs
gerrarde
had
been
prevailed
on
to
write
to
mr
arnold
i
begged
she
would
give
me
leave
to
read
the
copy
of
the
letter
to
her
as
i
assured
her
there
was
nothing
in
it
but
would
give
her
pleasure
she
consented
and
i
read
it
leaving
out
mr
faulkland
apostrophes
my
mother
did
not
interrupt
me
and
finding
she
continued
silent
when
i
came
to
the
conclusion
i
looked
at
her
and
saw
tears
running
down
her
cheeks
yes
my
dear
my
innocent
child
said
she
passionately
throwing
her
arms
round
me
you
wronged
god
knows
you
were
wronged
and
he
now
proclaims
your
innocence
even
from
the
mouth
of
your
most
inveterate
enemy
and
lifting
up
her
eyes
thou
hast
turned
the
hearts
of
sinners
to
the
wisdom
of
the
just
therefore
shall
the
righteous
give
thee
thanks
and
then
god
forgive
that
woman
all
her
sins
for
this
one
act
and
god
forgive
mr
faulkland
sins
and
reward
him
for
this
goodness
sure
your
husband
will
relent
now
sure
he
will
long
to
take
my
poor
forsaken
virtuous
child
and
her
tears
gushed
as
she
spoke
to
his
bosom
again
i
could
not
answer
her
for
some
time
my
own
tears
almost
choaked
me
at
last
i
said
my
dear
mother
i
have
no
doubt
of
mr
arnold
returning
kindness
he
will
i
hope
be
convinced
that
i
am
guiltless
and
we
may
yet
be
happy
she
dried
her
eyes
god
send
god
send
you
may
but
what
has
mr
faulkland
done
with
his
poor
penitent
i
hope
he
will
behave
honourably
to
her
for
this
excellent
parent
had
no
doubt
but
that
the
letter
written
by
mrs
gerrarde
was
in
a
great
measure
the
result
of
her
own
contrition
for
as
i
had
not
been
minute
in
giving
her
a
particular
account
of
all
the
previous
steps
taken
by
mr
faulkland
to
obtain
it
from
her
she
had
not
the
least
idea
that
mrs
gerrarde
had
writ
in
that
manner
from
any
other
motive
than
the
good
one
which
appeared
obvious
to
her
i
told
her
that
i
feared
mrs
gerrarde
was
far
from
being
the
penitent
she
supposed
her
and
then
acquainted
her
with
the
true
reasons
which
had
induced
her
to
write
in
the
manner
she
had
done
i
then
proceeded
to
tell
her
of
her
behaviour
after
writing
the
letter
and
how
mr
faulkland
had
acted
in
consequence
of
that
concluding
with
informing
her
of
mrs
gerrarde
being
married
and
provided
for
in
a
very
reputable
way
my
mother
was
highly
delighted
at
this
last
circumstance
for
she
said
mr
faulkland
had
no
right
to
be
the
punisher
of
her
crimes
and
if
he
had
not
made
a
decent
provision
for
her
she
would
never
have
looked
upon
him
but
as
a
dishonest
person
she
told
me
that
though
she
was
very
glad
upon
the
whole
that
mr
arnold
and
that
bad
woman
were
separated
yet
she
was
nevertheless
not
quite
so
well
satisfied
with
the
manner
of
it
for
i
think
said
she
that
it
is
impossible
but
that
a
man
of
mr
arnold
good
sense
must
one
time
or
other
have
been
convinced
of
his
error
and
of
his
own
accord
returned
to
a
right
way
of
thinking
i
answered
that
might
possibly
have
happened
but
that
he
might
have
continued
long
enough
under
his
infatuation
intirely
to
ruin
his
family
and
as
for
what
regarded
me
in
particular
i
knew
of
no
means
so
likely
to
remove
his
unjust
suspicions
effectually
as
those
which
mr
faulkland
had
taken
you
are
right
my
dear
said
she
let
us
hope
the
best
i
am
glad
mr
faulkland
does
not
mean
to
return
soon
to
england
there
is
but
one
event
which
could
ever
reconcile
me
to
his
doing
so
and
that
is
in
order
to
do
justice
to
the
unfortunate
miss
burchell
if
he
would
wipe
out
that
blot
in
his
character
by
marrying
her
i
should
again
allow
him
to
be
a
good
man
at
present
i
own
i
ca
help
being
dissatisfied
that
one
so
blameable
as
i
think
him
should
have
laid
my
daughter
under
the
obligations
which
he
has
done
i
said
it
would
rejoice
me
if
he
could
be
prevailed
on
to
make
miss
burchell
the
reparation
she
mentioned
but
i
feared
she
had
no
advocate
with
mr
faulkland
though
i
was
of
opinion
if
he
were
made
acquainted
with
the
life
of
sorrow
she
led
as
well
as
her
reserved
and
modest
behaviour
he
would
be
inclined
to
favour
her
especially
if
he
were
to
see
the
poor
little
boy
my
mother
said
he
never
could
expect
quiet
of
mind
till
he
had
wiped
the
tears
from
her
eyes
miss
burchell
came
in
while
we
were
speaking
of
her
my
mother
is
always
glad
to
see
her
the
poor
girl
had
been
exceedingly
shocked
at
mr
faulkland
carrying
away
her
aunt
she
thought
this
action
put
such
an
invincible
bar
between
her
and
her
hopes
almost
desperate
before
that
it
went
near
to
distract
her
for
though
there
was
no
consanguinity
in
the
case
yet
the
degree
of
relationship
between
her
and
mrs
gerrarde
made
her
look
upon
this
amour
for
so
she
considered
it
with
the
utmost
horror
she
had
so
often
expressed
her
sense
of
it
in
so
lively
a
manner
both
to
my
mother
and
me
that
had
mr
faulkland
even
been
inclined
to
offer
his
hand
she
could
not
consistently
either
with
virtue
or
common
decency
have
accepted
of
it
my
mother
ever
delighted
with
acts
of
humanity
was
in
haste
to
communicate
the
true
state
of
the
case
to
miss
burchell
it
was
her
interest
to
keep
our
secret
therefore
i
made
no
scruple
of
trusting
her
with
it
especially
as
i
knew
it
would
so
much
contribute
to
her
peace
of
mind
my
mother
accosted
her
with
saying
miss
burchell
i
have
something
to
tell
you
that
i
believe
will
give
you
pleasure
the
unhappy
young
woman
lifted
up
her
melancholy
eyes
and
shaking
her
head
answered
i
believe
madam
is
now
impossible
your
aunt
is
married
said
my
mother
but
not
to
mr
faulkland
and
what
is
more
there
has
never
any
thing
passed
between
them
that
need
be
a
bar
to
you
if
he
could
be
brought
to
consider
you
as
he
ought
miss
burchell
looked
amazed
then
turned
her
eyes
from
my
mother
to
me
as
if
for
an
explanation
my
mother
desired
me
to
acquaint
her
with
the
history
at
large
of
mr
faulkland
proceedings
i
did
so
and
took
care
not
to
omit
the
tender
manner
in
which
he
had
mentioned
her
in
one
of
his
letters
she
dropped
some
tears
at
the
recital
and
then
turning
to
my
mother
my
dear
good
madam
you
have
snatched
me
from
despair
by
this
discovery
i
was
overwhelmed
i
think
i
could
not
have
got
the
better
of
my
grief
a
faint
ray
of
glimmering
hope
is
once
more
let
in
upon
me
mr
faulkland
may
be
mine
without
a
crime
or
if
he
is
not
i
shall
at
least
have
the
satisfaction
to
think
him
not
so
abandoned
as
he
appeared
to
me
an
hour
ago
oh
worthy
and
lovely
mrs
arnold
said
she
addressing
herself
to
me
you
see
how
mr
faulkland
reveres
you
oh
that
you
would
but
engage
in
my
behalf
can
influence
his
heart
can
guide
his
reason
are
his
fate
her
fine
eyes
which
she
fixed
on
me
filled
with
persuasive
eloquence
let
me
into
the
whole
of
her
meaning
and
conveyed
more
to
me
than
it
was
in
the
power
of
words
to
do
i
understand
you
dear
madam
said
i
and
it
grieves
my
heart
to
think
that
i
can
not
must
not
interest
myself
for
you
in
the
manner
i
would
most
ardently
undertake
to
do
if
there
were
not
such
obstacles
in
my
way
as
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
get
over
mr
faulkland
you
see
is
free
from
the
guilt
we
all
feared
he
had
plunged
himself
into
he
is
full
of
remorse
for
the
injury
he
did
you
and
i
dare
believe
retains
in
his
heart
a
tender
sense
of
your
merit
he
is
still
free
nay
he
has
declared
his
intention
of
continuing
so
these
circumstances
give
large
room
for
hope
your
unobjectionable
conduct
joined
to
paternal
affection
may
still
bring
about
that
happy
event
but
this
must
be
left
to
time
and
the
workings
of
his
own
heart
you
know
mr
faulkland
is
in
his
natural
temper
impatient
of
restraint
he
is
but
a
very
young
man
and
has
a
few
of
those
levities
which
a
little
more
settled
age
infallibly
will
correct
where
a
good
heart
and
a
good
understanding
are
united
pardon
me
if
i
add
that
mr
faulkland
is
not
ungenerous
however
blameable
he
may
have
been
in
regard
to
you
all
these
circumstances
considered
i
say
may
warrant
your
indulging
a
hope
that
he
will
at
last
be
brought
to
make
you
the
reparation
which
is
mine
and
my
mother
wish
as
much
as
your
own
ah
madam
said
she
but
mr
faulkland
is
a
great
way
from
me
the
remembrance
of
me
is
already
but
too
much
worn
out
distance
time
and
a
variety
of
objects
must
intirely
efface
it
hand
the
powerful
magic
of
touch
would
soon
brighten
up
the
colouring
of
those
faint
faded
traces
that
he
but
scarcely
preserves
of
me
in
his
memory
what
could
not
your
pen
guided
by
a
heart
so
tender
so
sympathizing
with
the
grief
of
others
effect
on
the
man
who
considers
you
as
a
divinity
if
he
had
any
hopes
of
madam
it
would
be
presumption
in
me
to
put
in
my
claim
but
as
you
can
not
be
my
rival
be
my
advocate
do
dear
angelic
lady
and
she
lifted
up
her
hands
to
me
fervently
write
to
mr
faulkland
if
you
can
restore
him
to
me
what
prayers
will
i
not
pour
out
for
your
happiness
my
mother
who
was
greatly
affected
by
her
discourse
said
to
me
indeed
my
dear
if
you
could
effect
that
it
would
be
a
very
meritorious
work
who
knows
what
the
high
opinion
mr
faulkland
has
of
you
and
the
great
deference
he
pays
to
your
judgment
may
produce
i
was
sorry
my
good
mother
openness
of
heart
had
made
her
enter
so
suddenly
into
miss
burchell
sentiments
it
encouraged
her
to
renew
her
intreaties
she
snatched
both
my
mother
hands
and
kissed
them
she
wanted
words
to
thank
her
i
was
unwilling
to
appear
cold
in
miss
burchell
interest
or
to
refuse
doing
what
my
mother
seemed
to
approve
but
the
resolution
i
had
long
before
made
never
to
see
or
on
any
account
whatsoever
to
hold
the
least
correspondence
with
mr
faulkland
determined
me
if
strict
prudence
might
on
so
extraordinary
an
occasion
have
dispensed
with
this
promise
which
as
i
had
made
it
to
my
own
heart
i
thought
amounted
almost
to
a
vow
i
could
not
however
answer
it
to
that
decorum
which
i
had
as
an
inviolable
law
determined
to
guide
myself
by
in
so
critical
a
situation
and
i
resolved
to
have
it
in
my
power
to
say
in
case
mr
arnold
and
i
were
ever
to
unite
again
that
i
had
not
in
the
smallest
article
departed
from
it
i
told
miss
burchell
there
was
but
one
reason
which
could
prevent
me
from
complying
with
her
request
but
it
was
one
of
so
much
weight
with
me
that
after
my
informing
her
of
it
i
hoped
she
would
be
so
good
as
not
to
urge
me
farther
i
did
said
i
upon
my
parting
with
my
husband
make
a
firm
resolution
not
only
never
to
see
mr
faulkland
but
never
to
receive
from
or
write
a
line
to
him
nor
in
any
manner
whatsoever
to
keep
up
the
least
intercourse
with
him
i
did
not
know
but
that
mr
faulkland
if
he
should
learn
the
truth
considering
himself
to
be
as
he
really
was
though
innocently
the
cause
of
that
unfortunate
separation
might
either
with
a
design
of
consoling
me
or
of
vindicating
himself
from
any
suspicion
of
blame
have
endeavoured
to
see
me
or
write
to
me
in
this
i
was
mistaken
his
prudence
or
his
respect
for
me
prevented
him
from
attempting
either
the
resolution
i
had
made
however
i
thought
due
to
my
honour
as
well
as
my
own
the
same
cause
still
subsists
the
weight
of
it
perhaps
more
in
my
own
imagination
than
in
reality
but
if
it
even
be
so
indulge
me
dear
madam
to
my
mother
and
dear
miss
burchell
in
this
singularity
i
have
not
improbably
the
happy
prospect
of
being
restored
to
mr
arnold
esteem
let
me
then
be
able
to
assure
him
that
these
eyes
these
ears
these
hands
have
been
as
guiltless
as
my
heart
and
all
equally
estranged
from
mr
faulkland
this
is
a
declaration
i
think
due
to
that
punctilio
or
give
me
leave
to
call
it
that
delicacy
i
have
endeavoured
to
preserve
in
all
my
conduct
mother
you
always
taught
me
to
avoid
even
the
shadow
of
reproach
very
true
my
dearest
answered
my
mother
i
believe
you
are
in
the
right
miss
burchell
i
think
my
daughter
can
not
conformably
to
that
discretion
by
which
she
has
always
been
governed
undertake
your
cause
at
present
it
did
not
appear
to
me
at
first
in
the
light
wherein
sidney
has
now
put
it
miss
burchell
made
no
answer
but
by
her
tears
we
were
both
affected
and
i
wished
sincerely
to
have
had
it
in
my
power
to
serve
her
i
told
her
if
mr
arnold
and
i
should
ever
be
that
i
would
endeavour
to
draw
him
so
far
over
to
our
party
as
to
obtain
his
permission
to
correspond
with
mr
faulkland
that
i
was
sure
he
would
join
with
me
in
wishing
her
the
reparation
she
hoped
for
and
that
i
would
make
no
scruple
of
engaging
warmly
for
her
in
such
a
case
but
then
madam
said
she
with
what
face
can
you
interest
yourself
for
me
so
long
as
mr
arnold
shall
think
that
my
aunt
has
been
criminal
with
mr
faulkland
that
thought
said
i
did
not
occur
to
me
before
and
is
indeed
a
difficulty
for
should
mr
arnold
know
that
the
elopement
of
mrs
gerrarde
was
against
her
will
and
the
letter
she
wrote
him
extorted
from
her
by
mr
faulkland
it
might
perhaps
injure
me
as
much
in
his
opinion
as
mrs
gerrarde
false
suggestions
had
done
before
those
intricacies
dear
miss
burchell
must
be
left
to
time
which
i
hope
may
unravel
them
favourably
for
us
all
the
attempt
to
disclose
this
affair
to
mr
arnold
must
not
be
sudden
indeed
i
must
be
well
assured
of
his
restored
confidence
and
affection
before
i
can
venture
upon
it
at
all
whenever
that
joyful
event
happens
assure
yourself
of
my
best
endeavours
to
serve
you
if
i
have
really
any
influence
over
mr
faulkland
and
circumstances
should
so
happily
concur
as
to
put
it
in
my
power
to
make
use
of
it
be
contented
good
miss
burchell
said
my
mother
with
this
promise
which
my
daughter
has
made
you
if
mr
arnold
and
she
should
live
together
again
mr
faulkland
may
probably
return
to
england
as
nothing
i
believe
now
keeps
him
abroad
but
to
avoid
giving
mr
arnold
umbrage
in
the
present
unhappy
disunion
between
him
and
his
wife
my
brother
continues
sullen
he
seldom
visits
us
and
when
he
does
the
meeting
on
his
part
is
cold
he
has
made
himself
master
of
many
particulars
relating
to
poor
mr
arnold
unhappy
connection
with
mrs
gerrarde
for
since
her
elopement
the
affair
has
been
more
talked
of
than
it
was
before
and
her
whole
history
traced
out
she
was
the
daughter
of
an
innkeeper
in
a
country
town
and
ran
away
with
captain
gerrarde
in
his
march
through
it
upon
an
acquaintance
of
but
a
few
days
the
husband
who
was
passionately
fond
of
her
concealed
the
meanness
of
her
birth
and
put
her
off
to
his
relations
for
a
young
lady
of
a
reputable
family
with
whom
he
got
a
good
fortune
this
induced
his
sister
a
widow
lady
the
mother
of
miss
burchell
to
leave
at
her
death
the
care
of
the
unhappy
girl
to
captain
gerrarde
the
captain
whose
infirmities
increased
fast
upon
him
a
few
years
after
his
marriage
got
leave
to
retire
upon
into
the
country
and
he
lived
for
the
most
part
at
ashby
a
little
estate
which
he
had
purchased
and
settled
upon
his
wife
it
seems
he
had
a
pretty
good
personal
fortune
which
she
had
squandered
for
his
fondness
could
refuse
her
nothing
except
living
apart
from
him
at
london
which
he
could
never
consent
to
though
it
was
always
her
desire
but
being
debarred
of
this
she
betook
herself
to
such
pleasures
as
the
country
afforded
and
was
always
a
leading
woman
at
assemblies
and
such
other
amusements
as
were
within
her
reach
which
together
with
expensive
treats
at
home
and
her
supreme
delight
left
her
at
his
death
which
happened
about
five
years
after
their
marriage
in
the
indigent
state
she
in
her
account
of
herself
to
mr
faulkland
acknowleges
it
was
then
mr
arnold
became
acquainted
with
her
and
in
the
manner
she
represented
for
my
brother
has
lately
fallen
into
the
acquaintance
of
that
very
as
she
calls
him
which
she
mentions
a
mr
pinnick
at
whose
lodgings
they
first
met
this
gentleman
who
was
in
reality
nothing
more
than
an
humble
servant
of
the
lady
though
she
called
him
cousin
the
better
to
skreen
a
more
particular
connection
was
so
provoked
at
her
deserting
him
in
favour
of
mr
arnold
whom
he
said
he
was
sure
she
had
insnared
that
he
made
no
scruple
of
telling
all
he
knew
of
her
he
said
she
had
two
brothers
very
great
profligates
one
of
whom
had
been
put
into
prison
for
forgery
and
would
have
been
hanged
had
not
mr
arnold
at
the
expence
of
a
very
considerable
sum
saved
his
life
the
other
some
very
mean
retainer
to
the
law
a
plausible
fellow
and
mrs
great
favourite
for
whom
she
had
art
and
influence
enough
to
prevail
on
mr
arnold
to
purchase
a
considerable
employment
it
would
be
endless
said
mr
pinnick
to
tell
you
the
variety
of
stratagems
she
made
use
of
to
get
money
out
of
those
whom
she
had
in
her
power
and
who
were
able
to
supply
her
i
for
my
part
was
not
rich
enough
for
her
which
was
the
chief
reason
i
suppose
of
mr
arnold
supplanting
me
and
i
take
it
for
granted
that
those
arts
which
she
practised
on
me
to
little
effect
succeeded
better
with
him
one
time
her
poor
father
was
in
gaol
and
his
whole
family
would
be
undone
and
her
mother
sent
a
begging
if
he
was
not
relieved
from
his
distress
by
a
trifling
sum
fifty
pounds
would
do
another
time
her
sister
husband
a
country
shopkeeper
was
upon
the
point
of
breaking
and
would
be
inevitably
ruined
if
he
was
not
assisted
and
then
she
had
a
formal
letter
to
produce
from
her
sister
upon
the
melancholy
occasion
these
circumstances
she
made
no
scruple
of
laying
open
to
me
as
she
knew
i
was
no
stranger
to
her
origin
having
resided
for
some
years
in
the
town
where
she
formerly
lived
though
i
did
not
then
know
her
her
mother
was
a
roman
catholick
and
in
order
to
have
her
daughter
brought
up
in
the
same
principles
with
herself
had
her
sent
to
a
relation
in
dublin
where
she
received
her
education
in
a
nunnery
though
her
artifices
to
get
money
from
me
were
grown
quite
stale
i
make
no
doubt
but
she
practised
them
all
over
again
on
poor
arnold
she
was
not
contented
with
the
lodgings
had
placed
her
in
but
obliged
him
to
take
a
handsome
house
elegantly
furnished
for
her
a
very
fine
chariot
and
horses
were
the
next
purchase
for
a
hired
one
the
lady
would
not
vouchsafe
to
sit
in
and
i
am
sure
i
have
seen
her
in
the
boxes
at
the
play
with
as
many
jewels
on
her
as
any
lady
there
all
these
ungrateful
particulars
which
sir
george
had
received
from
mr
pinnick
he
took
a
sort
of
ill
natured
pleasure
in
repeating
to
my
mother
and
me
unhappy
mr
arnold
into
what
a
gulph
didst
thou
unwarily
plunge
thyself
is
it
not
amazing
that
this
affair
was
even
so
long
a
secret
that
it
was
so
to
is
not
strange
for
it
is
natural
to
suppose
that
i
must
have
been
the
last
person
to
receive
a
hint
of
this
nature
but
that
my
brother
should
never
have
been
informed
of
it
is
surprizing
is
certain
mr
arnold
was
at
first
very
cautious
in
his
visits
making
them
generally
at
night
and
even
then
he
never
was
carried
in
his
own
chariot
i
am
shocked
to
think
of
the
mischiefs
which
i
fear
he
has
done
to
his
temporal
affairs
for
his
children
sake
as
well
as
his
own
but
since
he
is
delivered
from
the
thraldom
in
which
this
woman
held
him
the
rest
i
hope
by
future
good
management
may
be
retrieved
would
to
heaven
i
had
nothing
left
me
to
lament
but
the
waste
of
his
fortune
sir
george
says
he
is
sure
he
is
deeply
in
debt
the
too
i
hear
is
likely
to
go
against
us
if
that
is
to
be
the
case
it
will
be
a
blow
indeed
how
miserable
is
a
state
of
suspence
i
am
if
possible
more
unhappy
now
than
when
i
was
without
hope
of
recovering
my
dear
and
now
more
dear
because
undone
mr
arnold
our
cause
came
to
a
final
hearing
many
days
ago
though
i
was
not
told
it
till
this
morning
and
only
prepared
for
it
yesterday
and
it
is
given
against
us
mr
arnold
by
this
stroke
loses
pounds
a
year
besides
considerable
costs
nothing
now
remains
but
my
jointure
into
what
an
abyss
of
misery
is
my
unfortunate
husband
plunged
oh
that
i
could
but
see
him
that
i
could
but
regain
his
confidence
that
i
might
sooth
and
comfort
him
in
his
afflictions
my
brother
is
very
unkind
after
telling
me
the
fatal
news
he
said
he
thought
i
should
be
much
to
blame
if
i
returned
to
mr
arnold
though
he
were
even
desirous
of
it
what
prospect
can
you
have
with
him
but
beggary
said
he
for
i
suppose
his
next
step
will
be
to
wheedle
you
out
of
your
jointure
the
only
support
you
have
now
left
for
yourself
and
your
children
oh
brother
brother
said
i
you
have
no
heart
i
could
say
no
more
for
i
burst
into
tears
perhaps
you
may
not
be
put
to
the
trial
answered
he
cruelly
but
if
you
should
you
are
to
take
your
own
way
mrs
arnold
for
my
advice
had
never
any
weight
with
you
or
my
mother
my
mother
replied
sir
george
you
do
not
use
either
me
or
your
sister
well
let
her
in
the
name
of
god
follow
the
dictates
of
her
duty
if
the
unfortunate
mr
arnold
sees
his
error
can
you
be
so
unchristian
as
to
endeavour
at
steeling
his
wife
heart
against
him
o
son
this
is
not
the
way
to
obtain
forgiveness
of
god
for
your
own
faults
far
be
it
from
sidney
to
reject
the
proffered
love
of
a
repenting
husband
my
dear
to
me
do
afflict
yourself
if
your
husband
has
grace
you
shall
both
be
as
happy
together
as
can
make
you
misfortunes
said
sir
george
are
mighty
great
promoters
of
i
do
doubt
but
mr
arnold
will
repent
most
heartily
the
having
lavished
away
his
fortune
and
the
hopes
of
repairing
it
may
give
him
the
to
take
his
wife
again
sir
george
said
my
mother
angrily
you
will
oblige
me
if
you
say
no
more
on
the
subject
i
have
done
madam
said
my
brother
and
took
his
leave
i
had
almost
forgot
to
tell
you
by
what
means
the
widow
arnold
carried
her
suit
against
us
you
may
remember
i
informed
you
she
had
at
the
beginning
threatened
to
produce
a
witness
who
could
prove
that
her
late
husband
had
been
with
her
on
a
particular
night
a
very
little
time
before
his
death
who
this
witness
was
had
been
kept
an
impenetrable
secret
she
did
however
produce
him
when
the
cause
came
to
be
tried
and
this
witness
proved
to
be
mrs
gerrarde
brother
that
very
brother
whom
mr
arnold
had
redeemed
from
a
gaol
and
peril
of
hanging
this
man
it
seems
had
been
very
intimate
with
her
during
her
husband
while
she
was
in
a
state
of
separation
from
him
but
whether
he
was
at
all
acquainted
with
the
late
mr
arnold
we
have
no
other
testimony
than
his
own
is
however
most
certain
that
she
was
suspected
of
an
intrigue
with
him
and
in
all
human
probability
that
child
which
is
to
inherit
the
arnold
estate
is
his
this
concealed
villain
undoubtedly
was
the
person
who
first
suggested
this
vile
attempt
to
her
and
secretly
abetted
her
in
all
her
proceedings
it
was
after
the
commencement
of
the
law
suit
that
he
was
put
into
gaol
and
mr
arnold
little
imagined
when
under
mrs
influence
he
obtained
his
liberty
that
he
was
bestowing
on
this
wicked
wretch
power
to
ruin
him
i
do
not
imagine
mrs
gerrarde
was
in
this
secret
i
suppose
she
would
not
knowingly
have
contributed
to
beggar
the
man
by
whom
she
was
supported
in
affluence
but
be
that
as
it
will
the
evidence
of
this
fellow
who
was
bred
an
attorney
together
with
that
of
mrs
maid
established
the
proof
on
which
the
issue
of
the
whole
affair
turned
unfortunately
for
us
we
could
find
nobody
capable
of
giving
any
testimony
which
could
overthrow
theirs
and
the
irregularity
of
the
late
mr
arnold
life
gave
these
evidences
an
appearance
at
least
of
truth
god
forgive
those
people
the
foul
play
they
made
use
of
i
would
not
possess
a
king
revenue
on
the
terms
they
now
enjoy
the
arnold
estate
is
whispered
that
the
widow
is
supposed
to
be
privately
married
to
this
attorney
she
owes
him
a
recompence
for
i
fear
he
has
risqued
a
great
deal
to
serve
her
the
wretch
had
the
affrontery
to
acknowlege
his
obligation
to
mr
arnold
and
at
the
same
time
declared
that
nothing
but
the
justice
which
he
owed
the
widow
and
the
orphan
of
his
late
friend
could
have
extorted
a
testimony
from
him
to
his
prejudice
i
need
not
tell
you
in
what
light
my
poor
mr
arnold
looks
upon
this
affair
he
said
to
a
gentleman
from
whom
sir
george
had
the
account
that
he
was
justly
punished
for
having
furnished
such
a
villain
with
the
means
of
undoing
him
and
execrates
the
memory
of
mrs
gerrarde
who
prevailed
on
him
to
do
it
for
he
scarce
knew
the
fellow
at
that
time
having
only
seen
him
once
or
twice
at
her
lodgings
but
let
me
drop
the
mention
of
such
wretches
at
once
my
heart
is
full
of
impatience
to
hear
something
from
mr
arnold
mrs
gerrarde
letter
i
fear
has
had
no
effect
on
him
he
must
have
received
it
long
since
what
can
this
dreadful
silence
mean
my
mother
now
expects
the
advances
towards
a
reconciliation
should
be
on
side
i
would
i
were
rid
of
my
suspence
lord
and
lady
v
arrived
in
town
last
night
they
sent
a
compliment
to
me
as
soon
as
they
alighted
at
their
house
which
was
not
till
nine
and
this
morning
at
the
same
hour
i
was
agreeably
surprized
by
a
visit
from
my
lord
surprized
i
say
for
he
is
seldom
out
of
bed
so
soon
i
had
him
up
to
my
my
mother
had
never
seen
him
and
as
she
was
undressed
did
not
chuse
to
appear
well
my
good
lady
said
he
after
saluting
me
have
you
heard
from
mr
arnold
lately
i
told
him
i
had
not
i
do
know
whether
you
are
apprized
said
he
that
i
am
in
all
your
secrets
mr
faulkland
and
i
correspond
and
i
know
how
all
matters
stand
you
are
not
made
acquainted
perhaps
that
i
was
aiding
and
abetting
to
a
certain
scheme
i
told
him
that
mr
faulkland
had
writ
my
brother
the
whole
account
and
that
i
was
sure
of
his
kind
participation
in
every
thing
that
related
to
me
that
you
may
depend
on
said
he
the
thing
can
not
be
named
that
i
would
not
do
to
serve
you
i
understand
from
mr
faulkland
that
mrs
gerrarde
has
writ
to
mr
arnold
have
you
heard
of
no
effects
produced
by
that
letter
i
told
him
i
had
never
heard
a
word
from
mr
arnold
since
he
had
received
it
i
hope
it
will
not
be
long
before
you
will
answered
he
i
called
on
you
this
morning
on
purpose
to
prepare
you
for
i
suspect
arnold
wants
to
be
reconciled
he
wrote
to
me
ten
days
ago
conjuring
me
in
the
strongest
terms
to
come
to
town
and
to
prevail
on
lady
v
to
accompany
me
he
said
he
had
something
of
the
utmost
consequence
to
consult
us
upon
in
which
our
friendship
might
be
of
most
material
advice
to
him
he
concluded
with
telling
me
that
the
whole
happiness
of
his
life
depended
on
our
complying
with
his
request
now
as
this
was
immediately
on
his
receiving
mrs
gerrarde
letter
for
i
had
regular
intelligence
of
the
whole
proceeding
i
flatter
myself
that
it
was
in
consequence
of
that
letter
he
made
this
request
with
a
design
as
i
hope
of
getting
us
to
mediate
between
you
as
i
could
not
just
then
attend
his
summons
having
business
at
v
hall
to
detain
me
i
wrote
him
word
that
i
should
certainly
be
in
town
as
on
this
day
and
that
lady
v
would
be
sure
to
accompany
me
i
have
not
heard
from
him
since
till
last
night
when
i
sent
a
message
to
his
house
to
desire
his
company
to
breakfast
with
me
this
morning
i
expect
him
at
ten
now
i
had
a
mind
to
inform
you
of
this
opening
which
to
me
seems
to
promise
very
favourably
for
you
i
shall
not
mention
my
having
seen
you
so
that
i
can
say
nothing
from
you
to
him
i
asked
him
was
my
lady
acquainted
with
the
affair
as
it
really
stood
he
said
she
was
for
that
she
had
been
so
exasperated
against
mr
faulkland
on
his
first
going
off
with
mrs
gerrarde
whom
she
thought
he
had
run
away
with
upon
a
very
different
design
that
he
was
very
glad
to
undeceive
her
and
that
she
would
presently
have
done
the
same
by
me
after
the
letter
she
had
wrote
me
about
that
affair
but
that
he
prevented
her
thinking
mr
faulkland
would
be
better
pleased
to
unravel
the
mystery
himself
he
added
that
she
was
too
much
my
friend
not
to
enter
warmly
into
my
interests
and
had
been
extremely
impatient
to
come
to
town
i
thanked
my
lord
for
his
and
his
lady
friendship
he
then
asked
me
how
our
went
on
i
answered
it
had
been
determined
some
days
ago
and
we
had
lost
our
cause
he
turned
pale
at
the
news
good
god
what
an
unfortunate
man
your
husband
is
said
he
what
will
become
of
him
he
put
an
end
to
his
visit
immediately
telling
me
that
either
he
or
his
lady
would
call
on
me
in
the
afternoon
to
let
me
know
the
result
of
their
conference
with
mr
arnold
i
flew
to
my
mother
to
tell
her
the
joyful
news
she
offered
up
a
prayer
that
it
might
turn
out
as
my
lord
v
had
suggested
and
said
she
herself
was
of
the
same
opinion
with
a
heart
elated
with
pleasure
my
dear
cecilia
i
have
scribbled
over
the
occurrences
of
this
morning
god
grant
i
may
be
able
to
close
my
journal
of
with
the
happy
event
i
never
counted
the
clock
with
such
impatience
as
i
did
this
day
waiting
the
promised
visit
of
lord
or
lady
v
and
i
ordered
myself
to
be
denied
to
all
company
but
them
at
one
good
lady
v
came
without
my
lord
when
i
heard
the
rap
at
the
door
and
saw
from
the
window
it
was
her
equipage
i
was
seized
with
such
a
trembling
that
when
lady
v
who
hurried
up
stairs
entered
the
room
i
was
unable
to
speak
or
salute
her
she
ran
up
to
me
and
taking
me
by
the
hand
affectionately
embraced
me
my
mother
was
present
i
made
a
shift
to
present
her
to
lady
v
she
then
led
me
to
a
chair
and
sat
down
by
me
come
my
dear
mrs
arnold
said
she
recover
your
spirits
all
will
be
well
i
began
to
apologize
for
giving
her
ladyship
the
trouble
of
coming
to
me
when
it
was
my
duty
to
have
waited
on
her
do
not
mention
ceremony
said
she
i
was
in
too
much
haste
to
bring
you
good
news
to
think
of
forms
we
have
had
mr
arnold
with
us
till
within
this
half
hour
and
indeed
he
more
deserves
your
pity
now
than
your
resentment
oh
i
feared
it
said
i
and
tears
started
into
my
eyes
if
you
are
so
affected
at
the
barely
knowing
this
said
my
lady
i
must
not
tell
you
the
particulars
of
our
conversation
it
will
be
enough
for
you
to
know
that
your
husband
is
convinced
of
the
injuries
he
has
done
you
and
desires
nothing
more
than
your
forgiveness
dear
lady
v
said
i
excuse
me
my
heart
is
really
so
softened
by
sorrow
that
i
can
not
command
my
tears
but
i
beg
that
may
not
deter
you
from
indulging
me
with
the
particulars
of
what
passed
between
you
and
mr
arnold
if
i
do
weep
as
my
tears
no
longer
proceed
from
grief
do
not
let
them
interrupt
you
my
mother
joined
in
begging
lady
v
to
inform
us
of
all
that
passed
in
that
morning
interview
lady
v
obligingly
complied
and
gave
the
following
account
of
it
mr
arnold
came
exactly
at
ten
my
lord
was
just
returned
from
his
visit
to
you
and
had
got
in
but
a
few
minutes
before
him
poor
mr
arnold
looked
abashed
upon
seeing
me
his
countenance
and
his
voice
discovered
the
humiliation
of
his
mind
after
the
first
compliments
were
over
we
sat
down
to
breakfast
your
husband
drank
a
dish
of
coffee
but
eat
nothing
we
were
in
haste
that
the
servants
should
leave
the
room
and
dismissed
them
as
soon
as
we
could
my
lord
then
opened
the
conversation
by
saying
arnold
here
are
lady
v
and
i
come
to
attend
your
summons
now
tell
us
what
service
you
have
to
employ
us
in
for
i
assure
you
we
are
both
ready
to
do
you
any
act
of
friendship
in
our
power
my
lord
i
thank
you
said
mr
arnold
the
friendship
you
honour
me
with
i
flattered
myself
some
time
ago
might
have
been
serviceable
to
me
i
must
not
now
think
of
making
use
of
it
when
i
requested
the
favour
of
lady
v
presence
and
your
in
town
i
meant
to
intreat
your
interposition
between
me
and
mrs
arnold
i
know
i
have
wronged
her
so
that
were
she
any
other
than
the
woman
she
is
i
could
never
hope
for
forgiveness
but
from
i
did
hope
it
and
thought
your
good
offices
might
bring
about
a
reunion
but
that
is
all
over
i
neither
desire
nor
wish
it
now
i
am
sorry
for
that
mr
arnold
said
i
i
am
sure
nothing
in
this
world
besides
can
ever
make
either
your
lady
or
you
happy
do
you
know
madam
said
he
and
the
poor
man
really
looked
wildly
that
you
see
an
absolute
beggar
before
you
a
man
without
a
foot
of
land
overwhelmed
with
debts
and
who
shortly
will
not
have
a
house
to
shelter
himself
in
deserve
it
all
but
mrs
arnold
does
not
do
you
think
that
after
all
the
wrongs
i
have
done
her
i
will
involve
her
in
poverty
too
no
lady
v
no
i
am
not
such
an
abandoned
wretch
all
i
desire
now
of
your
ladyship
is
to
tell
my
wife
that
i
beg
her
forgiveness
and
request
she
will
take
care
of
our
two
children
though
the
scanty
pittance
that
her
mother
scrupulous
nicety
retained
for
her
will
hardly
enable
her
to
do
it
but
while
lady
bidulph
lives
i
believe
she
will
not
see
them
want
he
uttered
all
this
with
so
much
eagerness
that
we
never
once
attempted
to
interrupt
him
as
i
did
not
know
then
of
the
loss
of
your
cause
i
was
surprized
to
hear
him
speak
of
his
circumstances
being
so
desperate
and
really
feared
his
head
was
turned
but
my
lord
soon
explained
the
matter
by
saying
he
had
heard
that
morning
of
the
issue
of
his
yet
still
hoped
that
matters
were
not
so
bad
as
he
represented
them
to
be
he
then
told
mr
arnold
he
was
extremely
glad
to
find
that
his
wife
had
recovered
his
good
opinion
adding
that
always
had
the
highest
one
of
your
virtue
it
amazes
me
mr
arnold
said
i
that
you
ever
could
entertain
a
doubt
of
it
so
it
does
now
madam
said
mr
arnold
but
i
have
been
for
this
year
past
in
a
dream
a
horrid
delirium
from
which
that
vile
sorceress
who
brought
it
on
me
has
but
just
now
rouzed
me
i
wanted
to
draw
mr
arnold
to
this
point
have
you
heard
any
thing
of
her
since
she
left
you
sir
said
i
he
drew
a
letter
out
of
his
pocket
and
without
answering
me
put
it
into
my
hands
and
desired
me
to
read
it
then
rose
off
his
chair
and
walked
about
the
room
my
lord
and
i
read
mrs
gerrarde
letter
together
we
were
both
curious
to
see
it
mr
faulkland
having
mentioned
it
in
his
correspondence
mr
arnold
said
i
returning
it
to
him
any
such
proof
as
this
i
believe
nobody
that
knows
your
lady
would
think
her
guilty
nor
could
i
ever
entertain
so
bad
an
opinion
of
mr
faulkland
i
have
known
him
from
his
boyish
days
and
never
had
reason
to
believe
him
capable
of
a
dishonourable
action
i
believe
him
innocent
as
to
answered
mr
arnold
but
you
can
not
conceive
the
pains
that
were
taken
by
that
vile
woman
to
make
me
think
otherwise
neither
would
her
retracting
all
she
said
now
work
so
much
on
me
as
other
corroborating
circumstances
her
running
away
with
the
very
man
of
whom
she
raised
my
jealousy
after
having
plundered
me
of
almost
every
thing
i
had
to
bestow
does
not
look
like
a
sudden
resolution
the
scheme
must
have
been
concerted
for
some
time
and
faulkland
i
suppose
was
paramour
at
the
very
time
she
so
basely
slandered
mrs
arnold
for
i
am
not
so
blind
even
to
the
personal
charms
of
my
wife
as
to
imagine
the
greatest
inconstant
would
grow
tired
of
her
in
so
short
a
time
why
i
must
own
said
my
lord
that
is
a
natural
inference
which
joined
to
the
perfidy
and
falshood
of
mrs
gerrarde
puts
it
out
of
dispute
that
she
traduced
mr
faulkland
and
your
wife
merely
to
gain
her
own
wicked
ends
one
part
of
which
i
am
inclined
to
think
she
confesses
in
her
letter
that
is
to
say
to
have
you
intirely
in
her
own
hands
though
not
for
the
reason
she
there
gives
her
other
motive
i
think
now
plainly
appears
by
the
consequence
she
thought
if
you
were
jealous
of
your
wife
you
would
hardly
suspect
with
the
same
person
whose
visits
to
my
knowlege
were
pretty
frequent
at
her
house
then
said
i
throwing
my
weight
into
the
scale
the
unobjectionable
character
of
mrs
arnold
her
pious
education
her
modest
and
affectionate
behaviour
to
you
for
so
long
a
time
and
the
recluse
life
that
she
had
led
with
her
mother
since
you
parted
makes
the
thought
of
any
ill
in
her
quite
incredible
lady
v
said
your
husband
impatiently
i
am
as
conscious
of
it
all
as
you
can
possibly
wish
me
i
know
i
am
a
blind
infatuated
monster
what
can
you
say
more
faulkland
i
thank
you
for
ridding
me
of
such
a
pest
oh
that
you
had
taken
her
before
i
was
so
curst
as
to
see
her
face
if
you
had
i
should
not
now
be
the
undone
wretch
i
am
my
lord
my
lady
will
you
do
me
the
favour
to
tell
my
wife
and
lady
bidulph
how
contrite
i
am
and
he
laid
his
hand
on
his
breast
while
i
had
any
thing
to
offer
her
besides
repentance
i
could
have
thrown
myself
at
her
feet
for
pardon
and
conjured
her
to
have
returned
to
my
bosom
and
to
her
own
deserted
house
from
whence
my
madness
drove
her
but
i
have
now
no
house
to
bring
her
to
and
do
not
desire
even
to
see
her
face
his
manner
was
so
vehement
that
i
really
feared
the
agitations
of
his
mind
might
disorder
his
brain
my
lord
told
him
he
was
too
desponding
and
said
he
hoped
all
might
be
yet
retrieved
he
then
enquired
into
the
particular
situation
of
his
affairs
which
are
i
am
grieved
to
say
it
very
bad
indeed
we
were
told
when
we
were
in
kent
that
a
part
of
was
mortgaged
but
did
not
believe
it
as
we
knew
it
was
settled
on
you
upon
being
asked
mr
arnold
himself
acknowleged
it
confessing
at
the
same
time
that
he
had
been
prevailed
on
to
do
this
in
order
to
deliver
mrs
gerrarde
brother
out
of
gaol
and
that
it
was
the
other
villainous
brother
who
had
transacted
the
affair
for
him
i
find
besides
this
mortgage
that
with
the
costs
of
his
suit
he
owes
near
seven
thousand
pounds
to
answer
which
he
says
he
is
not
worth
his
plate
and
the
furniture
of
his
houses
in
town
and
country
excepted
though
i
had
shed
many
tears
whilst
lady
v
was
describing
mr
arnold
behaviour
at
the
beginning
of
her
discourse
i
heard
this
latter
part
of
her
account
with
a
composed
attention
lady
v
took
me
by
the
hand
i
am
sorry
dear
mrs
arnold
said
she
that
i
am
obliged
to
repeat
such
uncomfortable
tidings
to
you
but
you
must
know
all
soon
or
late
and
it
as
well
now
as
hereafter
i
am
sure
your
patient
temper
and
good
sense
will
enable
you
to
bear
up
against
misfortunes
my
lord
then
proceeded
to
ask
mr
arnold
if
his
friends
could
make
his
circumstances
a
little
easier
and
mrs
arnold
would
consent
to
live
with
him
again
had
he
any
objection
to
it
my
lord
answered
your
husband
from
the
moment
i
heard
of
mrs
gerrarde
elopement
i
flattered
myself
with
the
hopes
of
being
restored
to
my
senses
and
my
peace
by
a
reunion
with
my
wife
for
i
own
to
you
her
innocence
from
that
very
time
became
evident
to
me
and
it
was
mere
shame
that
prevented
me
from
making
my
application
to
lady
bidulph
for
the
purpose
of
a
reconciliation
the
receipt
of
mrs
gerrarde
letter
whether
the
wretch
has
felt
compunction
or
whether
her
cruelty
to
me
in
order
to
make
me
more
unhappy
has
drawn
it
from
her
i
know
not
the
receipt
of
that
letter
i
say
wherein
mrs
arnold
innocence
is
so
entirely
cleared
convinced
me
i
ought
not
to
delay
making
my
wife
all
the
reparation
in
my
power
though
i
was
shocked
to
think
how
much
i
had
foolishly
squandered
away
i
was
still
in
possession
of
an
estate
of
nine
hundred
pounds
a
year
for
though
it
was
then
in
litigation
my
lawyers
amused
me
to
the
last
with
a
belief
that
i
should
carry
my
suit
and
notwithstanding
that
the
payment
of
my
debts
would
lessen
it
i
knew
with
one
of
her
contented
and
gentle
spirit
it
would
be
sufficient
to
make
us
happy
and
her
jointure
which
i
hoped
soon
to
clear
added
to
it
would
enable
us
to
sit
down
in
the
country
in
tolerable
affluence
and
i
had
come
to
a
resolution
to
make
it
the
study
of
my
life
to
render
mrs
arnold
happy
i
know
she
is
an
admirable
oeconomist
i
resolved
to
imitate
her
and
hoped
in
time
to
retrieve
our
circumstances
these
were
my
sentiments
my
lord
when
i
wrote
to
you
to
beg
that
you
and
my
lady
would
come
to
town
i
own
i
had
not
courage
enough
to
make
any
efforts
towards
the
so
much
reunion
without
the
interposition
of
friends
whose
good
hearts
i
knew
would
rejoice
could
their
endeavours
bring
it
about
and
whose
influence
over
mrs
arnold
i
was
certain
would
make
the
accomplishment
easy
do
me
the
justice
my
lord
to
believe
that
if
i
had
not
thought
it
in
my
power
to
have
made
mrs
arnold
amends
for
the
injuries
i
have
done
her
this
hand
should
have
been
sooner
employed
to
send
a
bullet
thro
my
head
than
to
have
endeavoured
to
procure
your
mediation
in
this
affair
but
as
things
have
turned
out
i
would
not
for
this
earthly
globe
involve
her
in
my
ruin
nor
shall
her
family
have
it
to
say
i
sought
their
friendship
when
i
was
abandoned
of
every
other
hope
as
to
that
point
answered
my
lord
i
can
bear
you
witness
that
your
first
overture
to
me
in
order
to
bring
about
a
reconciliation
arrived
before
there
was
any
likelihood
of
your
standing
in
need
of
assistance
either
from
your
wife
friends
or
your
own
for
i
believe
they
all
as
well
as
yourself
were
pretty
sure
of
your
carrying
your
suit
which
if
you
had
done
your
affairs
might
with
a
little
care
have
soon
been
in
a
great
measure
retrieved
therefore
if
they
should
attempt
to
make
the
ungenerous
charge
you
apprehend
i
can
confute
it
and
will
to
all
the
world
and
for
the
rest
we
must
manage
as
well
as
we
can
my
lord
then
proposed
some
methods
to
make
his
affairs
a
little
more
easy
as
i
am
sure
his
friendship
for
mr
arnold
and
you
will
make
him
endeavour
to
settle
them
to
the
best
of
his
power
my
lady
v
politeness
and
generosity
would
not
suffer
her
to
mention
the
particulars
of
the
methods
proposed
but
i
have
reason
to
believe
my
good
lord
v
will
interest
himself
rather
farther
than
i
wish
when
my
lord
and
mr
arnold
she
proceeded
had
talked
over
these
matters
for
some
time
in
which
my
lord
had
much
ado
to
get
the
better
of
mr
arnold
obstinacy
he
told
him
that
i
should
undertake
to
explain
his
situation
to
you
and
lady
bidulph
that
he
made
no
doubt
of
your
tenderness
in
forgetting
all
that
was
past
and
being
willing
to
embrace
his
fortunes
let
them
be
what
they
would
for
said
he
i
am
sure
mrs
arnold
will
think
herself
happier
with
you
on
three
hundred
pounds
a
year
than
she
would
with
twice
so
many
thousands
without
you
oh
madam
said
i
interrupting
her
my
lord
has
read
my
very
heart
my
lady
smiled
and
went
on
lady
bidulph
said
my
lord
is
so
good
a
woman
that
as
she
must
look
on
you
in
the
light
of
a
repenting
sinner
you
may
be
assured
of
her
pardon
and
favour
that
he
may
rest
satisfied
of
answered
my
mother
my
income
is
not
considerable
and
i
have
never
been
able
to
lay
any
thing
by
but
if
mr
arnold
can
be
extricated
from
his
present
difficulties
so
as
to
be
able
to
retire
quietly
into
the
country
i
will
share
that
little
with
him
my
lady
v
eyes
moistened
mine
were
quite
suffused
i
assure
you
said
lady
v
it
was
not
without
abundance
of
arguments
used
by
my
lord
and
downright
quarrelling
on
my
side
that
mr
arnold
could
be
prevailed
on
to
consent
that
any
other
application
should
be
made
on
his
part
than
that
of
acquainting
you
with
his
penitence
and
communicating
his
resolution
together
with
his
motives
for
it
of
never
seeing
you
more
he
says
sir
george
bidulph
never
was
his
friend
and
as
he
supposes
him
more
now
his
enemy
than
ever
he
would
be
sorry
to
be
under
any
obligations
to
him
my
mother
who
never
conceals
her
thoughts
answered
directly
of
that
i
believe
he
need
not
be
apprehensive
sir
george
is
not
very
liberal
he
would
have
persuaded
his
sister
against
returning
to
her
husband
and
i
am
sure
will
not
be
willing
to
contribute
towards
making
their
reunion
happy
besides
as
he
is
now
going
to
be
married
he
troubles
himself
with
little
else
than
his
intended
bride
lady
v
seemed
shocked
i
was
sorry
my
mother
had
spoken
so
freely
of
sir
george
to
one
who
was
an
entire
stranger
both
to
him
and
her
but
she
is
so
good
that
even
her
errors
proceed
from
virtue
well
said
lady
v
we
have
now
seen
the
worst
side
of
the
prospect
let
us
turn
our
eyes
towards
the
pleasanter
view
what
do
you
mean
to
do
mrs
arnold
mean
madam
said
i
to
go
directly
to
my
husband
well
well
replied
she
smiling
i
suppose
but
how
do
you
purpose
to
settle
your
little
household
matters
i
think
said
my
mother
the
best
thing
you
can
do
is
to
go
directly
down
to
my
house
in
wiltshire
you
know
and
the
furniture
are
mine
during
my
life
they
go
to
your
brother
afterwards
send
for
your
two
children
and
honest
martha
dispose
of
your
house
in
town
and
all
your
effects
here
as
well
as
at
and
in
essex
let
the
produce
be
applied
to
the
payments
of
debts
as
far
as
it
will
go
you
will
then
have
your
jointure
to
receive
to
which
i
will
add
two
hundred
pounds
a
year
which
will
enable
you
by
degrees
to
pay
off
the
rest
of
your
debts
and
i
do
not
see
why
you
may
not
live
comfortably
besides
extremely
well
said
my
lady
with
mrs
arnold
good
management
especially
as
they
will
not
have
the
expence
of
i
am
sure
my
lord
will
willingly
undertake
to
manage
mr
arnold
affairs
in
town
for
him
and
i
would
have
you
both
get
into
the
country
as
fast
as
you
can
i
am
entirely
of
your
opinion
lady
v
said
my
mother
what
do
you
think
child
dear
madam
i
think
that
i
am
the
happiest
woman
breathing
such
a
parent
as
you
such
a
friend
as
lady
v
and
such
a
husband
as
i
promise
myself
mr
arnold
will
prove
how
can
i
be
otherwise
than
happy
i
am
ready
to
do
to
do
joyfully
whatever
you
direct
dear
lady
v
ought
not
i
to
see
poor
mr
arnold
immediately
why
said
lady
v
i
would
not
have
you
surprize
him
he
is
to
dine
with
us
and
i
will
prepare
him
to
receive
you
in
the
afternoon
at
my
house
if
you
chose
it
by
all
means
my
good
lady
v
i
will
come
to
your
house
at
five
well
said
she
bring
a
few
spirits
with
you
and
do
not
let
the
interview
soften
you
too
much
lady
v
then
took
her
leave
as
she
said
she
should
hardly
have
time
to
dress
before
dinner
my
mother
and
i
spent
the
interval
between
that
time
and
evening
in
talking
of
our
future
scheme
of
life
remember
my
dear
said
she
that
when
i
die
you
lose
the
best
part
of
your
income
as
my
house
together
with
my
jointure
revert
to
sir
george
and
you
have
no
great
reason
to
expect
that
he
will
continue
either
to
you
it
therefore
behoves
you
to
use
oeconomy
as
well
for
the
sake
of
a
little
as
to
accustom
yourselves
to
upon
a
little
i
would
myself
accompany
you
down
to
the
country
but
as
my
son
marriage
is
so
near
he
would
have
reason
to
take
it
amiss
of
me
and
i
know
i
shall
have
his
imperious
temper
to
battle
with
on
our
making
up
matters
between
you
and
your
husband
but
i
shall
make
myself
easy
by
reflecting
that
we
have
both
acted
agreeably
to
our
duty
you
never
my
cecilia
experienced
such
a
situation
as
mine
and
therefore
can
have
no
idea
of
what
i
felt
in
expectation
of
seeing
the
person
whose
presence
i
most
ardently
wished
for
and
yet
was
afraid
of
the
interview
my
fears
were
not
on
my
account
conscious
as
i
was
of
my
innocence
i
had
no
apprehensions
on
that
head
but
i
could
not
bear
the
thoughts
of
beholding
poor
mr
arnold
in
the
state
of
humiliation
in
which
i
supposed
i
should
find
him
i
wished
the
first
encounter
of
our
eyes
over
and
as
the
appointed
hour
approached
my
anxiety
increased
i
was
faint
and
seized
with
universal
tremors
my
mother
did
all
she
could
to
encourage
me
and
a
little
before
five
i
was
put
into
a
chair
and
carried
to
lord
v
house
my
lady
met
me
on
the
stairs
i
could
scarce
breathe
she
carried
me
into
her
and
made
me
sit
down
till
i
recovered
a
little
she
was
affected
herself
but
endeavoured
to
raise
my
spirits
i
wish
said
she
smiling
you
had
been
in
my
lord
hands
he
would
have
prepared
you
better
than
lady
bidulph
has
for
this
meeting
he
has
been
trying
to
make
mr
arnold
drunk
in
order
to
give
him
courage
he
says
to
face
you
poor
man
he
could
scarcely
credit
me
when
i
told
him
you
were
to
come
this
evening
she
proposed
my
taking
a
few
drops
which
i
agreed
to
and
bidding
me
pluck
up
my
spirits
said
she
would
send
mr
arnold
to
me
i
catched
lady
v
by
the
hand
and
begged
she
would
desire
him
from
me
not
to
mention
any
thing
that
was
past
but
let
our
meeting
be
as
if
the
separation
had
only
been
occasioned
by
a
long
journey
she
left
me
and
mr
arnold
in
a
few
minutes
entered
the
room
he
approached
me
speechless
my
arms
were
extended
to
receive
him
he
fell
into
them
we
neither
of
us
spoke
there
was
no
language
but
tears
which
we
both
shed
plentifully
mr
arnold
sobbed
as
i
pressed
him
to
my
bosom
my
dearest
sidney
said
he
can
it
be
is
it
possible
that
you
love
me
still
if
lady
v
delivered
my
message
to
you
my
dear
mr
arnold
sure
you
would
not
speak
thus
to
me
i
understand
you
said
he
oh
my
dear
i
never
wished
for
wealth
or
length
of
days
till
now
but
what
i
can
i
will
forbear
my
love
said
i
remember
my
request
i
wanted
to
give
his
thoughts
another
turn
my
mother
longs
to
see
you
when
will
you
visit
her
i
will
throw
myself
at
her
feet
said
he
i
want
a
blessing
from
her
and
she
has
sent
me
one
throwing
his
arms
again
round
me
how
much
are
we
obliged
to
good
lord
and
lady
v
said
oh
they
have
opened
to
me
the
path
to
heaven
he
answered
if
it
had
not
been
for
them
i
think
we
had
better
go
to
them
said
i
they
will
partake
in
our
happiness
he
took
me
by
the
hand
without
answering
and
led
me
into
the
i
have
my
sister
endeavoured
to
recollect
our
disjointed
conversation
in
order
to
give
it
to
you
as
well
as
i
could
all
that
i
can
remember
i
have
set
down
though
i
am
sure
a
good
deal
more
passed
lord
v
eyes
sparkled
when
he
saw
us
enter
together
but
my
lady
and
he
i
suppose
had
agreed
before
hand
to
say
nothing
that
could
recall
any
past
griefs
for
they
only
smiled
at
our
entrance
and
my
lord
said
arnold
you
really
hand
your
lady
in
with
as
gallant
an
air
as
if
you
were
married
within
these
three
hours
and
so
i
have
been
my
lord
answered
mr
arnold
my
lady
presently
called
for
tea
and
we
chatted
as
if
nothing
had
happened
the
servants
waiting
in
the
room
made
this
necessary
though
i
could
observe
the
two
footmen
who
had
lived
a
good
while
with
lord
v
looked
with
no
small
astonishment
at
mr
arnold
and
me
when
the
servants
were
withdrawn
my
lady
introduced
the
subject
of
our
going
out
of
town
she
had
before
acquainted
him
with
my
proposal
and
i
repeated
what
she
had
said
to
me
on
that
head
after
lady
v
had
left
us
my
lord
renewed
the
kind
offers
of
his
friendship
and
said
as
we
meant
so
shortly
to
part
with
our
house
in
st
that
he
thought
it
would
be
better
for
us
not
to
go
into
it
at
all
but
make
use
of
his
house
while
we
staid
in
town
as
perhaps
mr
arnold
might
not
like
to
be
at
lady
bidulph
on
account
of
sir
george
coming
there
i
readily
assented
to
this
proposal
and
mr
arnold
said
it
would
be
most
agreeable
to
him
i
told
him
however
i
should
be
glad
of
my
approbation
and
asked
mr
arnold
if
he
did
not
think
it
would
be
right
of
us
both
to
wait
on
her
together
to
let
her
know
of
my
lord
kind
invitation
my
lady
v
said
by
all
means
and
the
sooner
the
better
if
you
please
i
will
order
you
the
chariot
i
would
have
you
see
lady
bidulph
directly
mr
arnold
said
it
was
what
he
purposed
doing
that
very
night
the
chariot
was
presently
at
the
door
lady
v
said
i
have
an
apartment
ready
and
shall
with
lady
bidulph
permission
expect
you
back
we
promised
to
return
and
drove
to
my
mother
i
left
mr
arnold
in
the
parlour
whilst
i
ran
up
stairs
to
inform
her
of
his
being
come
to
wait
on
her
unluckily
as
well
as
unexpectedly
i
found
my
brother
with
her
i
judged
by
his
voice
as
i
came
up
stairs
that
he
was
talking
warmly
to
my
mother
he
stopped
however
when
i
came
into
the
room
he
was
standing
and
had
his
hat
under
his
arm
i
concluded
he
was
going
and
was
not
sorry
for
it
he
cast
a
cold
look
at
me
and
with
an
ironical
smile
i
wish
you
joy
and
he
pronounced
my
name
with
an
emphasis
tho
i
was
stung
at
his
manner
i
would
not
let
him
see
it
thank
you
brother
said
i
god
be
praised
i
cause
to
rejoice
oh
no
doubt
o
said
he
so
have
we
all
that
your
husband
has
been
graciously
pleased
after
beggaring
you
and
your
children
turning
you
out
of
doors
and
branding
you
with
infamy
to
receive
you
at
last
into
his
favour
sir
george
said
i
you
shock
me
exceedingly
where
is
the
need
of
those
cruel
repetitions
indeed
you
are
very
unkind
and
i
could
not
refrain
from
tears
the
more
blameable
mr
arnold
conduct
has
been
said
my
mother
the
more
cause
have
we
to
rejoice
in
his
amendment
we
must
make
allowances
for
human
failings
ay
madam
i
wish
you
had
thought
of
that
in
mr
case
cried
my
brother
my
mother
seemed
disconcerted
at
the
rebuke
sir
george
looked
and
smiled
with
an
air
of
triumph
as
my
mother
was
not
quick
in
answering
i
replied
the
cases
are
very
different
brother
what
duty
obliges
us
to
pass
by
in
a
husband
it
is
hardly
moral
not
to
discountenance
in
another
man
you
say
true
child
said
my
mother
a
woman
certainly
ought
not
to
marry
a
loose
man
if
she
knows
him
to
be
such
but
if
it
be
her
misfortune
to
be
joined
to
such
a
one
she
is
not
to
reject
him
but
more
especially
if
she
sees
him
willing
to
reform
where
is
your
husband
my
dear
madam
he
is
below
in
the
parlour
he
is
come
to
receive
your
forgiveness
and
your
blessing
he
shall
have
both
said
my
good
mother
and
my
prayers
too
sir
george
looked
a
little
surprized
i
will
not
interrupt
so
a
ceremony
said
he
but
i
hope
you
will
give
me
leave
to
withdraw
before
you
desire
him
up
stairs
saying
this
he
bowed
slightly
to
my
mother
and
left
the
room
we
neither
of
us
said
any
thing
to
stop
him
my
mother
rang
the
bell
but
before
a
servant
could
attend
he
went
out
and
clapped
the
door
violently
after
him
go
bring
your
husband
up
to
me
said
my
mother
i
begged
she
would
not
mention
any
thing
of
sir
george
behaviour
i
found
mr
arnold
impatient
at
my
stay
poor
man
his
situation
made
him
jealous
of
every
thing
that
looked
like
a
slight
i
told
him
my
brother
had
been
above
stairs
and
as
i
did
not
think
a
meeting
would
at
that
time
have
been
agreeable
to
either
of
them
i
waited
till
he
was
gone
i
perceive
he
knew
was
in
the
house
said
mr
arnold
by
the
blustering
manner
of
his
departure
i
made
no
reply
but
taking
him
under
the
arm
led
him
to
my
mother
that
best
of
women
received
him
with
a
tenderness
that
delighted
me
he
put
one
knee
to
the
ground
while
she
embraced
him
with
maternal
love
then
raised
him
and
taking
his
hand
and
mine
joined
them
holding
them
between
her
own
god
bless
you
my
children
said
she
and
may
you
never
more
be
separated
till
god
who
joined
you
calls
one
or
other
of
you
to
himself
amen
cried
i
fervently
amen
repeated
mr
arnold
he
then
besought
my
mother
to
forgive
him
for
all
the
affliction
he
had
occasioned
both
to
her
and
me
assuring
her
that
his
veneration
for
her
and
his
tenderness
for
me
were
augmented
a
and
should
for
the
future
influence
his
whole
conduct
after
this
we
fell
on
the
subject
of
our
domestick
affairs
we
informed
my
mother
of
my
lord
v
proposal
and
said
as
we
should
stay
in
town
but
two
or
three
days
we
had
accepted
of
the
offer
of
being
at
his
house
rather
than
by
our
presence
banish
my
brother
from
her
he
is
an
untractable
man
said
she
but
as
i
do
not
wish
to
quarrel
with
my
children
i
think
it
will
be
prudent
for
you
to
stay
at
my
lord
rather
than
here
mr
arnold
said
his
obligations
to
lord
v
were
unspeakable
for
that
he
had
promised
not
only
to
see
all
our
affairs
properly
settled
but
to
take
the
mortgage
of
into
his
own
hands
as
he
fears
the
person
who
now
has
it
will
not
be
so
tender
a
creditor
as
himself
he
also
proposes
as
the
sale
of
my
effects
can
not
amount
to
what
my
debts
come
to
to
pay
what
may
be
deficient
and
make
himself
my
sole
creditor
if
it
had
not
been
for
such
a
prospect
as
this
added
my
dear
mr
arnold
notwithstanding
your
goodness
and
lady
bidulph
i
had
resolved
never
to
have
appeared
before
either
of
you
we
determined
to
set
out
for
in
three
or
four
days
at
farthest
and
took
leave
of
my
mother
for
this
night
i
told
lady
v
this
morning
that
though
i
was
determined
never
to
mention
our
past
misfortune
to
mr
arnold
yet
i
owned
i
had
a
great
curiosity
to
know
what
means
mrs
gerrarde
had
made
use
of
to
work
up
his
suspicions
to
the
high
pitch
she
had
done
but
i
would
rather
remain
unsatisfied
than
mortify
him
by
the
recollection
of
this
particular
i
can
inform
you
of
her
whole
proceedings
answered
lady
v
as
i
had
it
from
mr
arnold
himself
for
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
was
as
curious
about
that
as
you
and
took
the
liberty
to
ask
your
husband
concerning
it
yesterday
when
we
had
him
to
ourselves
it
was
the
interval
between
dinner
and
the
hour
that
you
were
expected
here
in
the
evening
that
i
laid
hold
of
for
this
purpose
as
i
found
him
then
composed
enough
to
bear
the
enquiry
he
told
me
that
from
the
time
of
his
going
down
to
mrs
gerrarde
had
begun
to
throw
out
insinuations
concerning
you
that
had
a
little
alarmed
him
she
asked
him
whether
you
made
a
good
wife
which
he
answering
in
the
affirmative
she
replied
she
was
glad
of
it
for
that
she
had
been
told
your
affections
were
formerly
deeply
engaged
to
a
very
fine
young
gentleman
who
as
his
fortune
was
very
much
above
your
expectations
your
mother
fearing
your
violent
fondness
for
him
might
lead
you
into
some
act
of
indiscretion
had
carried
you
out
of
town
on
purpose
to
avoid
him
and
was
glad
to
marry
you
as
hastily
as
she
could
to
put
you
out
of
the
reach
of
harm
your
husband
acknowleges
that
he
believes
he
had
himself
casually
informed
mrs
gerrarde
of
the
manner
of
his
first
becoming
acquainted
with
you
and
the
suddenness
with
which
his
marriage
was
concluded
yet
she
pretended
to
him
she
was
before
apprized
of
these
particulars
he
owns
that
those
hints
though
far
from
giving
him
any
suspicion
of
your
virtue
had
nevertheless
made
some
impression
on
him
you
know
madam
added
he
that
madly
devoted
as
my
affections
were
to
mrs
gerrarde
i
had
always
behaved
to
my
wife
with
great
tenderness
and
respect
this
i
suppose
it
was
which
raised
mrs
gerrarde
jealousy
and
made
her
leave
no
method
unattempted
to
part
us
mr
faulkland
had
not
been
long
at
v
hall
when
she
asked
me
with
uncommon
earnestness
whether
he
visited
at
my
house
i
told
her
he
did
not
and
asked
the
meaning
of
her
enquiry
she
affected
to
turn
it
off
and
said
she
had
no
particular
reason
for
her
question
but
her
manner
was
such
as
the
more
excited
my
curiosity
at
length
she
was
prevailed
on
to
tell
me
that
mr
faulkland
was
the
man
for
she
had
not
yet
named
the
person
whom
my
wife
had
so
passionately
loved
prepossessed
as
i
was
with
jealousy
i
now
took
the
alarm
i
recollected
that
mrs
arnold
had
told
me
at
lord
v
upon
my
first
seeing
him
there
that
she
been
very
well
acquainted
with
him
and
i
even
thought
that
i
had
observed
something
particular
in
his
countenance
when
he
addressed
her
i
was
now
sure
that
he
had
come
into
the
neighbourhood
merely
on
her
account
the
hell
that
i
suffered
is
not
to
be
described
for
though
i
really
fancied
that
i
had
conceived
almost
an
aversion
to
mrs
arnold
i
yet
could
not
bear
the
thoughts
of
being
dishonoured
an
accident
happened
which
served
to
strengthen
my
suspicions
he
then
related
the
circumstance
of
his
seeing
you
at
the
public
house
on
the
night
of
the
fire
and
of
his
finding
mr
faulkland
putting
you
into
your
chariot
he
owned
at
the
same
time
that
he
was
there
with
mrs
gerrarde
whom
he
had
conducted
out
of
the
having
called
for
her
there
in
his
return
from
making
a
visit
as
he
had
promised
to
sup
with
her
that
night
mrs
gerrarde
when
she
had
him
at
her
house
affected
to
speak
with
some
surprize
of
your
imprudence
in
suffering
a
young
man
of
mr
faulkland
turn
for
gallantry
to
attend
you
to
a
place
and
at
that
hour
though
added
he
mrs
arnold
own
account
of
this
had
satisfied
me
at
the
time
yet
mrs
gerrarde
insinuations
blew
up
the
fire
anew
in
my
breast
she
pretended
to
sooth
me
but
the
methods
she
took
rather
increased
my
uneasiness
she
told
me
she
believed
my
honour
as
had
received
no
injury
and
to
preserve
it
effectually
she
thought
i
could
not
do
better
than
to
forbid
my
wife
to
see
mr
faulkland
the
designing
vile
woman
continued
your
husband
knowing
that
this
prohibition
would
cut
off
her
visits
at
v
hall
no
doubt
apprehended
my
wife
would
not
so
readily
acquiesce
under
it
and
she
was
sure
any
resistance
on
her
part
would
but
the
more
inflame
me
but
in
this
she
was
disappointed
for
i
no
sooner
required
mrs
arnold
promise
on
the
occasion
than
she
without
the
least
hesitation
made
it
my
requiring
so
extraordinary
a
proof
of
her
obedience
induced
mrs
arnold
to
enquire
into
the
cause
and
upon
my
explaining
it
she
acknowleged
that
mr
faulkland
had
once
been
her
lover
and
that
the
match
was
broken
off
by
her
mother
who
had
conceived
some
dislike
to
him
this
was
so
far
from
gaining
credit
with
me
that
it
only
served
to
corroborate
what
mrs
gerrarde
had
told
me
i
was
however
contented
for
the
present
with
the
promise
that
my
wife
had
made
me
of
which
i
informed
mrs
gerrarde
he
then
proceeded
to
tell
me
of
his
finding
you
and
mr
faulkland
together
one
evening
at
the
house
of
mrs
gerrarde
i
must
confess
continued
he
this
unexpected
incident
transported
me
beyond
the
bounds
of
patience
i
suffered
notwithstanding
mr
faulkland
to
go
quietly
out
of
the
house
more
for
mrs
gerrarde
sake
than
any
other
consideration
and
permitted
her
to
go
home
with
my
wife
who
i
then
thought
illness
waiting
in
the
mean
time
at
her
house
for
her
return
in
order
to
have
this
extraordinary
and
unexpected
meeting
explained
mrs
gerrarde
on
her
return
expressed
the
utmost
concern
and
resentment
on
the
occasion
she
told
me
that
as
she
had
expected
me
that
evening
which
was
really
the
case
she
had
sent
to
my
wife
to
engage
her
for
the
next
day
in
order
to
prevent
her
coming
to
interrupt
us
which
was
not
unlikely
as
mrs
arnold
had
not
been
to
see
her
from
the
time
she
was
laid
up
by
the
hurt
she
received
and
she
said
she
did
not
care
to
lay
herself
so
open
to
her
servants
as
to
have
herself
denied
to
the
wife
whilst
she
entertained
the
husband
i
myself
continued
he
having
the
same
apprehensions
had
asked
mrs
arnold
on
my
going
abroad
in
the
morning
how
she
purposed
to
dispose
of
herself
for
the
day
and
she
had
told
me
she
intended
to
stay
at
home
mrs
gerrarde
said
that
notwithstanding
her
message
she
was
surprized
with
a
visit
from
mrs
arnold
just
as
she
was
sitting
down
to
dinner
that
she
however
put
a
good
face
on
the
matter
and
received
her
very
cordially
but
in
order
to
get
rid
of
her
soon
told
her
she
was
engaged
abroad
in
the
afternoon
mrs
arnold
she
added
however
thought
proper
to
stay
and
i
could
not
avoid
asking
her
to
drink
coffee
while
we
were
at
it
behold
to
my
very
great
surprize
mr
faulkland
sent
in
his
name
and
immediately
entered
the
parlour
as
i
guessed
continued
mrs
gerrarde
that
this
was
a
settled
assignation
i
own
i
was
extremely
provoked
at
it
mr
faulkland
with
whom
i
formerly
had
a
very
slight
acquaintance
at
bath
slight
indeed
as
never
to
be
visited
by
him
now
very
audaciously
made
an
apology
for
not
having
waited
on
me
sooner
but
said
that
he
did
not
hear
of
my
being
in
the
neighbourhood
a
day
or
two
before
and
hoped
i
would
allow
him
the
honour
of
renewing
his
acquaintance
i
had
hardly
temper
enough
to
make
him
a
civil
answer
but
said
i
was
sorry
i
was
engaged
that
evening
and
must
be
obliged
to
go
out
immediately
i
thought
this
hint
was
enough
for
mrs
arnold
and
that
she
would
have
had
the
discretion
to
have
taken
her
leave
she
asked
pardon
for
having
kept
me
at
home
so
long
protesting
she
had
really
forgot
that
i
told
her
i
was
engaged
she
begged
she
might
not
detain
me
any
longer
saying
she
had
ordered
her
chariot
to
come
for
her
in
the
evening
and
that
she
would
wait
for
it
as
she
found
herself
not
very
well
and
therefore
not
able
to
walk
home
i
now
saw
into
the
whole
scheme
mr
faulkland
would
naturally
stay
to
keep
her
company
and
they
would
have
my
house
to
themselves
but
i
resolved
to
disappoint
them
both
and
telling
mrs
arnold
i
would
leave
her
at
home
ordered
the
chariot
to
the
door
mrs
arnold
opposed
this
under
pretence
of
not
giving
me
so
much
trouble
and
pretending
to
be
sick
and
faint
said
she
would
step
to
the
door
in
order
to
get
a
little
more
air
i
followed
her
hastily
and
your
coming
in
the
instant
i
suppose
detained
mr
faulkland
in
the
parlour
for
he
could
not
but
see
you
from
the
window
you
know
the
rest
added
mrs
gerrarde
and
i
leave
you
to
judge
whether
mrs
arnold
be
inclined
to
keep
her
word
with
you
in
regard
to
mr
faulkland
can
you
blame
me
madam
proceeded
your
husband
if
after
what
i
now
saw
and
heard
i
was
enraged
almost
to
madness
against
my
wife
the
base
woman
who
had
now
accomplished
her
wicked
purpose
encouraged
me
in
my
desperation
in
the
midst
of
my
fury
however
i
could
not
help
making
one
observation
which
was
that
as
mrs
gerrarde
going
or
pretending
to
go
out
that
evening
was
a
casual
thing
they
could
hardly
have
expected
an
opportunity
of
being
at
her
house
even
though
the
meeting
was
concerted
mrs
gerrarde
answered
that
was
very
true
and
she
supposed
there
was
nothing
at
first
farther
intended
than
that
the
should
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
and
conversing
together
as
they
had
been
so
long
separated
the
other
to
be
sure
said
she
was
an
which
the
opportunity
suggested
she
then
after
making
me
swear
secrecy
told
me
that
mrs
arnold
had
when
she
followed
her
out
to
the
door
conjured
her
not
to
tell
me
that
mr
faulkland
and
she
mrs
gerrarde
were
acquainted
for
said
she
as
mr
arnold
is
of
a
jealous
temper
and
has
heard
that
mr
faulkland
formerly
courted
me
he
would
not
suffer
me
to
come
near
your
house
if
he
knew
that
mr
faulkland
visited
you
i
promised
her
i
would
not
added
mrs
gerrarde
and
i
make
no
doubt
but
that
she
hoped
in
time
relying
on
my
good
nature
my
seeming
fondness
for
her
and
the
easiness
of
my
temper
to
engage
me
as
the
confidant
and
abettor
of
her
loose
amour
mrs
gerrarde
concluded
with
saying
that
she
believed
nothing
criminal
had
as
passed
between
mr
faulkland
and
my
wife
at
least
since
his
coming
to
v
hall
but
as
there
was
no
a
woman
from
her
will
it
was
very
probable
that
mrs
arnold
would
contrive
the
means
of
meeting
though
not
at
house
yet
somewhere
else
i
raved
threatened
talked
of
fighting
faulkland
and
locking
up
my
wife
she
artfully
dissuaded
me
from
such
violent
measures
by
a
number
of
arguments
which
i
will
not
trouble
you
with
repeating
amongst
other
things
she
said
that
i
had
no
right
to
call
faulkland
to
an
account
merely
from
surmise
which
was
all
i
had
to
ground
my
charge
on
and
though
there
was
the
strongest
reason
to
believe
he
had
dishonourable
designs
on
mrs
arnold
yet
as
i
could
not
directly
accuse
him
of
them
i
should
be
laughed
at
for
engaging
in
a
quarrel
which
to
the
world
would
appear
to
be
so
as
to
what
i
threatened
in
regard
to
my
wife
she
said
such
measures
only
make
a
woman
desperate
and
would
be
far
from
preventing
the
evil
in
short
that
it
would
be
better
to
part
quietly
without
embroiling
myself
with
her
friends
or
undertaking
the
hateful
office
of
becoming
gaoler
to
my
wife
she
found
me
but
too
well
disposed
to
follow
her
fatal
counsel
i
wrote
that
cruel
letter
to
my
wife
which
turned
her
from
her
home
at
mrs
gerrarde
house
she
kept
me
with
her
till
midnight
and
had
worked
up
my
resentment
to
such
a
pitch
that
i
determined
not
to
see
mrs
arnold
any
more
to
avoid
expostulations
i
went
to
a
friend
house
at
the
distance
of
several
miles
when
i
came
back
mrs
gerrarde
told
me
that
mr
faulkland
was
absent
from
v
hall
and
she
concluded
the
lovers
were
now
together
i
interrupted
your
husband
at
this
part
of
the
story
pursued
lady
v
and
told
him
that
to
knowledge
mr
faulkland
had
gone
to
to
see
sir
george
bidulph
before
you
left
your
own
house
and
did
not
set
out
from
thence
on
his
return
about
three
weeks
after
your
separation
at
the
account
of
which
he
was
exceedingly
surprized
dear
lady
v
said
he
do
you
think
i
want
any
farther
arguments
to
convince
me
what
an
injurious
wretch
i
have
been
to
the
best
of
women
i
have
one
observation
to
make
to
you
mr
arnold
added
i
which
is
that
your
lady
misfortune
was
intirely
owing
to
her
great
delicacy
and
the
nice
regard
she
had
to
your
peace
and
honour
i
do
not
understand
you
madam
he
replied
know
then
said
i
that
your
wife
was
well
acquainted
with
your
connection
with
mrs
gerrarde
from
the
very
night
that
you
found
her
at
the
public
house
to
which
the
accident
that
happened
to
her
obliged
her
to
go
she
owned
to
me
at
the
time
you
drove
her
from
her
home
that
she
had
discovered
your
amour
from
a
conversation
she
overheard
that
night
between
you
and
mrs
gerrarde
this
i
extorted
from
her
by
letting
her
know
i
was
no
stranger
to
the
intrigue
i
then
repeated
to
him
the
discourse
that
passed
between
him
and
that
wicked
woman
as
far
as
you
had
told
me
and
he
very
well
remembered
it
now
mr
arnold
said
i
to
prove
the
assertion
i
made
in
regard
to
your
lady
had
she
reproached
you
with
your
infidelity
as
wives
would
have
done
tho
it
might
have
occasioned
a
temporary
uneasiness
to
you
both
yet
would
it
have
prevented
her
from
falling
a
sacrifice
to
that
most
artful
and
wicked
of
her
sex
for
you
could
not
then
have
had
such
an
improbable
falshood
imposed
on
you
as
that
mrs
arnold
would
have
made
choice
of
the
of
her
husband
for
a
confidant
and
fix
on
house
as
the
rendezvous
for
a
the
base
woman
herself
had
no
reason
from
mrs
arnold
prudent
and
gentle
behaviour
to
think
she
was
suspected
by
her
your
husband
lifted
up
his
eyes
to
heaven
and
striking
his
breast
blind
blind
wretch
he
cried
infatuated
ungrateful
monster
are
there
no
amends
no
amends
in
thy
power
for
such
goodness
i
could
not
bear
such
a
description
of
my
poor
mr
arnold
deep
contrition
i
stopped
lady
v
and
being
now
informed
of
all
i
wanted
to
know
changed
the
conversation
we
are
preparing
to
get
into
the
country
with
all
speed
i
have
writ
to
patty
to
set
out
with
the
two
children
for
as
soon
as
possible
mr
arnold
has
put
his
affairs
intirely
into
the
hands
of
our
worthy
friend
lord
v
and
we
think
upon
a
calculation
that
what
we
have
in
town
at
and
at
will
go
near
to
answer
the
present
demands
that
are
upon
us
lady
v
is
the
best
creature
living
she
knows
that
neither
mr
arnold
nor
i
chuse
to
see
any
visitors
and
she
has
let
none
in
these
two
days
i
am
vexed
at
laying
her
under
such
a
restraint
though
her
will
not
suffer
her
to
think
it
one
we
shall
go
out
of
town
on
monday
we
spend
with
my
mother
as
do
lord
and
lady
v
who
are
mightily
charmed
with
her
and
then
adieu
to
london
perhaps
for
ever
if
my
mother
comes
down
to
me
as
she
intends
to
do
i
shall
have
no
temptation
ever
to
return
to
it
december
here
i
am
my
dear
in
the
house
of
my
nativity
your
sidney
and
her
arnold
as
happy
as
a
king
and
a
queen
or
to
speak
more
properly
happier
than
any
king
or
queen
in
christendom
my
two
dear
little
girls
are
well
thank
god
and
look
charmingly
poor
babes
they
could
have
no
idea
of
their
loss
when
i
left
them
yet
they
now
seem
pleased
at
seeing
me
again
my
faithful
patty
is
almost
out
of
her
wits
with
joy
i
have
no
maid
but
her
and
an
honest
servant
whom
my
mother
left
here
to
look
after
her
house
mr
arnold
has
retained
but
one
of
his
men
the
garden
is
taken
care
of
by
an
old
man
in
the
neighbourhood
to
whom
my
mother
allows
something
for
keeping
it
in
order
with
what
delight
do
i
recall
the
days
of
my
childhood
which
i
passed
here
so
happily
you
my
dear
cecilia
mix
yourself
in
all
my
thoughts
every
spot
almost
brings
you
fresh
into
my
memory
the
little
the
the
mount
and
the
that
you
used
to
love
so
but
the
sight
of
your
old
dwelling
makes
me
melancholy
i
think
i
could
not
bear
to
go
into
the
house
the
deserted
avenue
to
me
appears
much
darker
than
it
used
to
do
and
your
poor
doves
are
all
flying
about
wild
and
i
think
seem
to
mourn
the
absence
of
their
gentle
mistress
oh
cecilia
how
exquisite
are
the
pleasures
and
the
pains
that
those
of
too
nice
feelings
are
liable
to
you
whose
sensibility
is
as
strong
as
mine
know
this
from
what
trifles
do
minds
of
such
a
turn
derive
both
joy
and
grief
our
names
our
virgin
names
i
find
cut
out
on
several
of
the
old
elm
trees
this
conjures
up
a
thousand
pleasing
ideas
and
brings
back
those
days
when
we
were
inseparable
but
you
are
no
longer
rivers
nor
i
bidulph
then
i
think
what
i
have
suffered
since
i
lost
that
name
and
at
how
remote
a
distance
you
are
from
me
and
i
weep
like
a
child
but
away
with
such
reflections
i
am
now
happier
beyond
comparison
happier
i
think
than
i
was
before
my
afflictions
overtook
me
mr
arnold
heart
i
prize
infinitely
more
than
i
did
when
he
first
made
me
an
offer
of
it
because
i
am
sure
he
gives
it
now
from
a
thorough
conviction
that
i
deserve
it
and
therefore
i
am
certain
never
to
have
it
alienated
again
it
is
almost
three
years
since
i
left
this
place
and
the
welcomes
i
have
received
from
all
our
old
neighbours
and
acquaintance
have
given
me
more
satisfaction
than
i
can
express
mr
arnold
is
highly
pleased
with
the
marks
of
affection
which
he
sees
me
daily
receive
from
those
who
have
known
me
from
my
infancy
i
am
the
more
delighted
with
it
as
i
think
it
gives
me
an
additional
value
with
him
is
a
proof
at
least
that
i
never
misbehaved
during
the
long
number
of
years
that
our
former
friends
knew
me
and
we
must
needs
be
pleased
to
see
the
object
of
our
love
approved
of
by
others
this
i
speak
from
my
own
experience
mr
arnold
is
exceedingly
caressed
by
all
our
friends
and
seems
equally
delighted
with
them
you
know
we
have
some
of
the
best
people
in
the
world
amongst
our
old
set
of
acquaintance
if
you
my
mother
and
good
lady
v
were
within
my
reach
i
should
think
a
paradise
i
have
had
two
letters
one
from
lady
v
the
other
from
my
dear
mother
lady
v
tells
me
her
husband
is
bustling
about
for
us
to
put
affairs
in
the
best
condition
he
can
she
says
he
has
already
got
a
purchase
for
the
lease
of
our
house
in
st
and
all
the
moveables
in
it
as
they
now
stand
they
have
been
valued
at
two
thousand
seven
hundred
pounds
as
most
of
our
plate
is
there
as
well
as
our
chariot
and
a
pair
of
horses
this
has
fallen
very
short
of
our
expectations
but
lady
v
says
she
is
sure
there
was
not
more
allowed
for
the
furniture
than
half
their
original
value
though
they
have
not
been
a
great
while
in
use
she
tells
me
that
my
lord
has
employed
a
person
to
go
down
to
to
dispose
of
the
things
there
but
she
fears
we
shall
receive
a
very
indifferent
return
from
thence
as
there
is
but
part
of
the
furniture
of
mr
arnold
putting
in
the
old
goods
going
together
with
the
house
to
the
widow
my
steward
at
v
hall
has
instructions
about
he
writes
word
to
his
lord
that
he
believes
the
whole
of
what
is
there
will
not
sell
for
more
than
four
hundred
pounds
the
house
indeed
was
but
small
and
the
furniture
not
expensive
mrs
gerrarde
he
says
has
had
an
attachment
laid
on
her
house
by
a
person
who
built
some
bauble
for
her
in
her
garden
for
which
he
claims
a
debt
of
ninety
pounds
though
the
steward
says
it
is
not
worth
thirty
things
however
my
lady
adds
shall
be
adjusted
in
the
best
manner
we
can
and
my
lord
will
not
let
mr
arnold
be
distressed
on
account
of
any
deficiency
that
may
happen
in
those
sales
what
a
jewel
my
cecilia
is
an
honest
warm
friend
the
contents
of
my
mother
letter
are
that
sir
george
was
married
yesterday
to
lady
sarah
p
she
says
the
bride
was
most
extravagantly
fine
but
looked
neither
handsome
nor
genteel
this
was
much
for
my
good
mother
to
let
drop
from
her
pen
but
i
know
she
never
liked
lady
sarah
nor
did
her
ladyship
ever
treat
her
with
the
regard
due
to
her
character
and
to
the
person
of
one
who
was
to
stand
in
the
close
and
respectable
degree
of
relationship
to
her
which
my
mother
now
does
but
i
believe
i
have
before
told
you
that
the
blessings
of
good
sense
and
good
temper
are
bestowed
but
in
a
moderate
degree
on
lady
sarah
and
for
a
woman
of
quality
lady
v
tells
me
for
i
have
never
seen
her
that
her
breeding
is
not
of
the
highest
form
but
you
know
a
great
fortune
covers
a
multitude
of
imperfections
in
the
eyes
of
most
people
and
i
hope
her
love
for
my
brother
will
make
her
a
good
wife
i
am
grown
a
perfect
farmer
wife
and
have
got
a
notable
dairy
i
am
mistress
of
three
cows
i
assure
you
which
more
than
supply
my
family
then
i
have
the
best
poultry
in
the
country
and
my
garden
flourishes
like
eden
mr
arnold
is
such
a
sportsman
that
we
have
more
game
than
we
know
what
to
do
with
but
his
chief
pleasure
is
hunting
your
little
namesake
promises
to
be
the
greatest
beauty
in
the
county
dolly
who
is
a
pretty
little
and
her
father
great
favourite
prates
like
a
parrot
how
delightful
will
be
the
task
of
expanding
and
forming
the
minds
of
these
two
cherubs
how
joyfully
and
how
thankfully
do
i
look
back
on
the
troubled
sea
which
i
have
passed
my
voyage
indeed
was
not
long
but
my
sufferings
were
great
while
they
lasted
i
never
since
i
was
married
enjoyed
life
till
now
you
know
my
match
was
originally
the
result
of
duty
to
the
best
of
mothers
and
though
if
i
ever
knew
my
own
heart
it
was
absolutely
freed
from
all
attachment
to
any
other
person
yet
was
it
not
so
devoted
to
mr
arnold
as
to
have
made
him
my
choice
preferably
to
all
other
men
if
i
had
not
resolved
in
as
in
every
other
action
of
my
life
to
be
determined
by
those
to
whom
i
owed
obedience
when
i
married
mr
arnold
i
esteemed
him
a
sufficient
foundation
in
the
person
of
a
husband
whereon
to
build
love
that
love
his
kindness
and
my
own
gratitude
in
a
little
produced
in
my
heart
and
i
will
venture
to
say
few
wives
loved
so
well
none
better
you
know
i
could
never
bear
to
consider
love
as
a
childish
divinity
who
exercises
his
power
by
throwing
the
heart
into
tumultuous
raptures
love
tho
of
a
more
temperate
kind
was
sufficiently
fervent
to
make
mr
arnold
coldness
towards
me
alone
capable
of
wounding
my
heart
most
sensibly
but
when
this
coldness
was
aggravated
by
the
cruel
distrust
which
he
was
taught
to
entertain
of
me
the
blow
indeed
became
scarce
supportable
and
i
did
not
till
then
know
the
progress
he
had
made
in
my
affections
sorrows
my
cecilia
soften
and
subdue
the
mind
prodigiously
and
i
think
my
heart
was
better
prepared
from
its
sufferings
to
receive
mr
arnold
returning
tenderness
than
an
age
of
courtship
in
the
gay
and
prosperous
days
of
life
could
have
framed
it
to
i
exult
in
his
restored
affections
and
love
him
a
thousand
times
better
than
ever
i
did
he
deserves
it
i
am
sure
he
does
he
was
led
away
from
me
by
enchantment
nothing
else
could
have
done
it
but
the
charm
is
broke
thank
heaven
and
i
find
him
now
the
tenderest
the
best
of
men
every
look
every
word
every
action
of
his
life
is
expressive
of
a
love
next
to
adoration
oh
i
should
be
too
happy
if
the
blessings
i
now
possess
were
to
be
my
continued
portion
in
this
life
there
is
however
but
about
which
i
can
rationally
indulge
any
fears
my
mother
her
years
and
her
growing
infirmities
will
not
suffer
me
to
hope
for
her
being
long
absent
from
her
final
place
of
felicity
you
always
used
to
say
i
anticipated
misfortunes
this
event
be
farther
off
than
my
anxious
fears
sometimes
suggest
to
me
so
no
more
of
it
my
good
lady
v
writes
me
word
that
all
our
business
is
finished
the
whole
amount
of
our
effects
came
but
to
three
thousand
four
hundred
pounds
our
debts
including
some
charges
which
have
occurred
in
the
transacting
of
our
affairs
exceeded
eight
thousand
our
worthy
lord
v
has
paid
the
whole
and
has
made
himself
our
only
creditor
we
have
nothing
now
that
we
can
call
our
own
but
my
jointure
i
do
not
reckon
upon
my
mother
bounty
to
us
our
income
from
her
and
the
house
we
live
in
will
be
sir
george
whenever
it
is
our
misfortune
to
lose
her
but
she
tells
me
she
is
well
and
talks
of
coming
down
in
about
a
fortnight
i
am
here
in
a
scene
of
still
life
my
dear
and
you
must
now
expect
to
hear
of
nothing
but
such
trivial
matters
as
used
to
be
the
subject
of
our
journals
when
we
were
both
girls
and
you
lived
within
a
of
and
saw
me
every
day
the
last
three
months
of
my
life
have
glided
away
like
a
smooth
stream
when
there
is
not
a
breath
of
wind
to
ruffle
it
and
after
you
read
the
transactions
of
one
day
you
know
how
i
pass
all
the
rest
i
have
told
you
of
that
came
to
see
me
and
all
the
visits
that
i
returned
i
have
given
you
an
account
of
all
our
old
acquaintance
and
of
some
new
ones
you
know
what
my
amusements
are
and
what
my
business
indeed
what
i
call
business
is
my
chief
pleasure
you
who
are
surrounded
by
the
gaieties
of
a
splendid
court
had
need
of
the
partiality
which
i
know
you
have
for
your
sidney
to
desire
a
continuation
of
her
insipid
narrative
but
i
suppose
if
i
were
to
tell
you
that
on
such
a
day
my
white
brought
out
a
fine
brood
of
chickens
you
might
be
as
well
pleased
with
it
as
i
should
be
to
hear
from
you
of
the
birth
of
an
indeed
my
cecilia
there
is
such
a
sameness
in
my
days
that
i
believe
i
must
have
recourse
to
telling
you
my
dreams
to
furnish
out
matter
of
variety
we
have
had
a
wedding
in
our
neighbourhood
young
main
brother
has
got
a
very
pretty
young
gentlewoman
with
a
fortune
of
five
thousand
pounds
it
seems
this
pair
had
been
fond
of
each
other
from
their
childhood
but
the
girl
fortune
put
her
above
her
lover
hopes
however
as
he
has
for
a
good
while
been
in
very
great
business
and
has
the
reputation
of
being
better
skilled
in
his
profession
than
any
one
in
the
country
he
was
in
hopes
that
his
character
his
affection
for
him
and
his
own
constancy
would
have
some
little
weight
with
her
family
accordingly
he
ventured
to
make
his
application
to
the
young
woman
brother
at
whose
disposal
she
was
her
father
having
been
dead
for
some
years
but
he
was
rejected
with
scorn
and
forbid
the
house
the
girl
father
it
seems
had
been
an
humourist
and
left
her
the
fortune
under
a
severe
restriction
for
if
ever
she
married
without
her
brother
consent
she
was
to
lose
it
so
that
in
that
particular
instance
of
disposing
of
her
person
she
was
never
to
be
her
own
mistress
in
the
disposal
of
her
fortune
however
he
did
not
so
tie
her
up
for
after
the
age
of
she
had
the
power
of
bequeathing
her
fortune
by
will
to
whom
she
pleased
the
brother
who
is
a
very
honest
man
had
no
motive
but
a
regard
to
his
sister
interest
in
refusing
poor
mr
main
a
man
of
good
fortune
had
proposed
for
her
whom
the
brother
importuned
her
to
accept
of
but
she
was
firm
to
her
first
attachment
the
young
lover
found
means
to
convey
a
letter
to
his
mistress
in
which
he
told
her
that
as
he
was
in
circumstances
to
support
her
genteelly
if
she
would
venture
to
accept
of
his
hand
he
would
never
more
bestow
a
thought
on
her
fortune
this
proposal
the
prudent
young
woman
declined
on
her
own
part
but
advised
him
to
make
it
to
her
brother
as
she
was
not
then
without
suspicions
that
he
wished
to
retain
her
fortune
in
the
family
and
that
it
was
only
to
save
appearances
he
had
proposed
a
match
to
her
of
which
he
was
sure
she
would
not
accept
but
in
this
opinion
she
injured
him
she
thought
however
the
experiment
might
be
of
use
in
giving
the
better
colour
to
her
marrying
afterwards
the
man
whom
she
loved
but
it
was
an
attempt
and
succeeded
accordingly
for
if
the
brother
should
have
given
his
consent
he
could
have
no
pretence
for
withholding
her
portion
or
if
he
did
so
by
mutual
agreement
his
motive
for
denying
his
consent
before
must
appear
too
obviously
to
be
a
bad
one
the
young
people
not
considering
this
sufficiently
resolved
to
make
the
trial
accordingly
mr
main
wrote
to
the
brother
a
very
submissive
letter
telling
him
he
would
in
the
most
solemn
manner
relinquish
all
claim
to
his
sister
fortune
if
he
would
make
him
happy
by
consenting
to
their
marriage
without
which
he
said
the
young
lady
regard
for
her
brother
would
not
suffer
her
to
take
such
a
step
this
letter
had
no
other
effect
than
that
of
making
the
brother
extremely
angry
he
sent
a
severe
message
to
the
young
man
to
acquaint
him
that
he
looked
upon
his
proposal
as
a
most
injurious
affront
to
his
character
but
that
he
was
ready
to
convince
him
and
else
that
he
had
no
designs
upon
his
sister
fortune
as
he
would
not
refuse
his
consent
to
her
marriage
with
any
other
man
in
the
country
but
himself
this
was
a
to
the
poor
lover
he
comforted
himself
however
with
the
hopes
that
his
mistress
heart
would
determine
her
in
his
favour
notwithstanding
the
severity
of
the
brother
there
had
been
it
seems
besides
this
gentleman
not
thinking
mr
main
a
suitable
match
for
his
sister
some
old
family
pique
between
him
and
mr
main
father
these
transactions
happened
some
time
before
i
came
to
the
country
just
about
that
juncture
the
poor
girl
had
the
misfortune
to
receive
a
hurt
in
her
breast
by
falling
against
the
sharp
corner
of
a
desk
from
a
stool
on
which
she
had
stood
in
order
to
reach
down
a
book
that
was
in
a
little
case
over
it
this
accident
threw
her
into
a
fit
of
illness
which
put
a
stop
to
all
correspondence
between
her
and
her
lover
in
this
illness
a
fever
which
was
her
apparent
complaint
was
the
only
thing
to
which
the
physician
paid
attention
and
the
hurt
in
her
breast
was
not
enquired
after
so
that
by
the
time
she
was
tolerably
recovered
from
the
former
the
latter
was
discovered
to
be
in
a
very
dangerous
way
and
required
the
immediate
assistance
of
a
surgeon
you
may
be
sure
poor
main
was
not
the
person
pitched
upon
to
attend
her
another
was
called
in
of
less
skill
but
not
so
obnoxious
to
the
family
by
this
bungler
she
was
tortured
for
near
three
months
at
the
end
of
which
time
through
improper
treatment
the
malady
was
so
far
increased
that
the
operator
declared
the
breast
must
be
taken
off
as
the
only
possible
means
of
saving
her
life
the
young
gentlewoman
family
were
all
in
the
greatest
affliction
she
herself
seemed
the
only
composed
person
amongst
them
she
appointed
the
day
when
she
was
to
undergo
this
severe
trial
of
her
fortitude
it
was
at
the
distance
of
about
a
week
the
surgeon
objected
to
the
having
it
put
off
so
long
but
she
was
peremptory
and
at
last
prevailed
on
the
evening
preceding
the
appointed
day
she
conjured
her
brother
in
the
most
earnest
manner
to
permit
mr
main
to
be
present
at
the
operation
the
brother
was
unwilling
to
comply
as
he
thought
it
might
very
much
discompose
her
but
she
was
so
extremely
pressing
that
he
was
constrained
to
yield
the
attending
surgeon
was
consulted
on
the
occasion
who
having
declared
that
he
had
no
objection
to
mr
main
being
present
that
young
man
was
sent
for
he
had
been
quite
inconsolable
at
the
accounts
he
received
of
the
dangerous
state
in
which
his
mistress
was
and
went
with
an
aching
heart
to
her
brother
house
in
the
morning
he
was
introduced
into
her
chamber
where
he
found
the
whole
chirurgical
apparatus
ready
the
young
woman
herself
was
in
her
closet
but
came
out
in
a
few
minutes
with
a
countenance
perfectly
serene
she
seated
herself
in
an
elbow
chair
and
desired
she
might
be
indulged
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
speak
a
few
words
to
her
brother
before
they
proceeded
to
their
work
her
brother
was
immediately
called
to
her
when
taking
him
by
the
hand
she
requested
him
to
sit
down
by
her
you
have
said
she
been
a
father
to
me
since
i
lost
my
own
i
acknowlege
your
tenderness
and
your
care
of
me
with
gratitude
i
believe
your
refusal
of
me
to
mr
main
was
from
no
other
motive
but
your
desire
of
seeing
me
matched
to
a
richer
man
i
therefore
freely
forgive
you
that
only
act
in
which
you
ever
exercised
the
authority
my
father
gave
you
over
me
my
life
i
now
apprehend
is
in
imminent
danger
the
hazard
nearly
equal
whether
i
do
or
do
not
undergo
the
operation
but
as
they
tell
me
there
is
a
chance
in
my
favour
on
one
side
i
am
determined
to
submit
to
it
i
put
it
off
to
this
day
on
account
of
its
being
my
i
am
now
one
and
twenty
and
as
the
consequences
of
what
i
have
to
go
through
may
deprive
me
of
the
power
of
doing
what
i
intended
i
have
spent
this
morning
in
making
my
will
you
brother
have
an
ample
fortune
i
have
no
poor
relations
i
hope
therefore
i
stand
justified
to
the
world
for
having
made
mr
main
my
heir
saying
this
she
pulled
a
paper
from
under
her
gown
which
she
put
into
her
brother
hand
that
he
might
read
it
it
was
her
will
wrote
by
herself
regularly
signed
and
witnessed
by
two
servants
of
the
family
sir
said
she
turning
to
the
other
surgeon
as
soon
as
my
brother
is
withdrawn
i
am
ready
for
you
you
may
imagine
this
had
various
effects
on
the
different
persons
concerned
the
brother
however
displeased
he
might
have
been
at
this
act
of
his
sister
had
too
much
humanity
to
make
any
animadversions
on
it
at
that
time
he
returned
the
paper
to
his
sister
without
speaking
and
retired
poor
main
who
had
stood
at
the
back
of
her
chair
from
his
first
coming
in
had
been
endeavouring
to
suppress
his
tears
all
the
time
but
at
this
proof
of
his
mistress
tenderness
and
generosity
it
was
no
longer
in
his
power
to
do
so
and
they
burst
from
him
with
the
utmost
violence
of
passion
the
other
surgeon
desired
him
to
compose
himself
for
that
they
were
losing
time
and
the
lady
would
be
too
much
ruffled
the
heroic
young
woman
with
a
smiling
countenance
begged
of
him
to
dry
his
eyes
perhaps
said
she
i
may
recover
then
fixing
herself
firmly
in
the
chair
she
pronounced
with
much
composure
am
ready
two
maid
servants
stood
one
at
each
side
of
her
and
the
surgeon
drew
near
to
do
his
painful
work
he
had
uncovered
her
bosom
and
taken
off
the
dressings
when
mr
main
casting
his
eyes
at
her
breast
begged
he
might
have
leave
to
examine
it
before
they
proceeded
the
other
surgeon
with
some
indignation
said
his
doing
so
was
only
an
unnecessary
delay
and
had
already
laid
hold
of
his
knife
when
mr
main
having
looked
at
it
said
he
was
of
opinion
it
might
be
saved
without
endangering
the
lady
life
the
other
with
a
contemptuous
smile
told
him
he
was
sorry
he
thought
him
so
ignorant
of
his
profession
and
without
much
ceremony
putting
him
aside
was
about
to
proceed
to
the
operation
when
mr
main
laying
hold
of
him
said
that
he
should
never
do
it
in
his
presence
adding
with
some
warmth
that
he
would
engage
to
make
a
perfect
cure
of
it
in
a
month
without
the
pain
or
hazard
of
amputation
the
young
lady
who
had
been
an
of
what
passed
for
she
would
not
suffer
her
face
to
be
covered
now
thought
it
proper
to
interpose
she
told
the
unfeeling
operator
the
he
might
be
very
sure
she
would
embrace
any
distant
hope
of
saving
herself
from
the
pain
the
danger
and
the
loss
she
must
sustain
if
he
pursued
the
method
he
intended
she
was
not
however
so
irresolute
she
said
as
to
desire
either
to
avoid
or
postpone
the
operation
if
it
should
be
found
necessary
but
as
there
was
hope
given
her
of
a
cure
without
it
she
thought
it
but
reasonable
to
make
the
experiment
and
should
therefore
refer
the
decision
of
her
case
to
a
third
person
of
skill
in
the
profession
by
whose
opinion
she
would
be
determined
the
two
women
servants
who
are
always
professed
enemies
to
chirurgical
operations
readily
joined
in
her
sentiments
and
saying
it
was
a
mortal
sin
to
cut
and
hack
any
christian
they
made
haste
to
cover
up
their
young
lady
again
the
disappointed
surgeon
hardly
forbore
rude
language
to
the
women
and
telling
mr
main
he
would
make
him
know
what
it
was
to
traduce
the
skill
of
a
practitioner
of
his
standing
marched
off
in
a
violent
passion
saying
to
his
patient
if
she
had
a
mind
to
kill
herself
it
was
nothing
to
him
the
modest
young
man
delighted
to
find
the
case
of
his
beloved
not
so
desperate
as
he
had
supposed
it
to
be
begged
she
would
permit
him
to
apply
some
proper
dressings
to
the
afflicted
part
and
conjuring
her
to
call
in
the
aid
of
the
ablest
surgeon
that
could
be
procured
took
his
leave
the
brother
of
the
lady
being
apprized
of
what
had
passed
lost
no
time
in
sending
an
express
to
bath
and
by
a
very
handsome
gratuity
induced
a
surgeon
of
great
eminence
to
set
out
immediately
for
his
house
who
arrived
early
the
next
morning
but
in
the
mean
time
poor
main
had
like
to
have
paid
dear
for
his
superior
skill
in
his
profession
the
other
surgeon
had
no
sooner
got
home
than
he
sent
him
a
challenge
to
meet
him
that
evening
in
a
field
at
some
distance
from
the
town
they
met
main
had
the
good
fortune
after
wounding
to
disarm
his
antagonist
but
first
received
himself
a
dangerous
wound
this
accident
was
kept
from
the
knowledge
of
his
mistress
but
on
the
arrival
of
the
surgeon
from
bath
as
he
would
not
take
off
the
dressings
but
in
the
presence
of
the
person
who
put
them
on
it
was
thought
proper
that
both
mr
main
and
the
other
man
should
be
sent
for
the
latter
was
not
by
any
means
in
a
condition
to
attend
but
the
former
though
very
ill
and
feverish
desired
that
he
might
be
carried
to
the
house
the
bath
surgeon
having
in
his
and
the
presence
examined
the
case
declared
it
as
his
opinion
that
the
complaint
might
be
removed
without
amputation
adding
that
it
was
owing
to
wrong
management
that
the
grievance
had
gone
so
far
he
consulted
with
main
in
the
presence
of
the
family
as
to
his
intended
method
of
treating
it
for
the
future
he
agreed
with
him
intirely
with
regard
to
the
propriety
of
it
and
having
assured
the
friends
of
the
girl
that
he
thought
him
a
skilful
and
ingenious
young
man
took
his
leave
being
obliged
to
return
directly
home
the
testimony
of
this
gentleman
whose
skill
was
undoubted
and
whose
impartiality
must
be
so
too
having
never
seen
any
of
the
parties
concerned
in
his
life
before
wrought
so
much
upon
the
brother
that
he
did
not
hesitate
to
put
his
sister
under
the
care
of
her
lover
poor
main
though
scarce
able
to
leave
his
bed
for
some
time
was
nevertheless
carried
to
his
patient
every
day
at
the
hazard
of
his
life
his
skill
his
tenderness
and
his
assiduity
were
all
exerted
in
a
particular
manner
on
the
present
occasion
and
in
less
than
five
weeks
he
had
the
pleasure
to
see
his
mistress
restored
to
perfect
health
the
consequence
of
this
incident
was
very
happy
for
them
both
the
brother
exceedingly
pleased
at
his
whole
behaviour
told
him
he
was
an
honest
generous
fellow
and
since
he
was
convinced
it
was
his
person
and
not
her
fortune
he
was
attached
to
he
would
with
all
his
heart
bestow
both
on
him
and
accordingly
mr
arnold
and
i
had
this
day
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
this
worthy
young
pair
united
in
marriage
patty
is
not
a
little
delighted
at
her
brother
good
fortune
the
honest
youth
who
has
ever
since
his
father
death
supported
his
mother
and
as
many
of
the
younger
children
as
were
not
able
to
gain
their
own
livelihood
has
now
invited
his
sister
patty
to
live
with
him
but
the
faithful
girl
declined
the
offer
telling
her
bother
she
would
never
quit
me
while
i
thought
her
worthy
of
my
regard
i
look
upon
myself
to
be
much
obliged
to
her
for
this
as
the
station
she
is
now
in
can
not
be
so
advantageous
as
i
hoped
to
make
it
when
i
first
took
her
into
my
service
but
i
will
make
up
in
kindness
what
may
be
wanting
in
profit
indeed
i
consider
her
rather
as
a
friend
than
a
servant
and
mr
arnold
always
treats
her
with
respect
i
am
very
uneasy
at
not
having
it
in
my
power
to
fulfil
my
promise
to
poor
miss
burchell
but
that
is
a
string
i
dare
not
as
yet
touch
upon
indeed
i
can
not
bear
any
conversation
that
leads
to
the
subject
whenever
mr
arnold
begins
to
accuse
himself
for
his
unhappy
conduct
in
relation
to
mrs
gerrarde
which
he
often
does
i
always
stop
him
or
turn
the
discourse
to
something
else
he
never
speaks
of
her
now
but
with
a
contemptuous
indifference
and
is
so
firmly
persuaded
that
she
went
off
willingly
with
mr
faulkland
that
i
dare
not
as
yet
undeceive
him
which
i
must
necessarily
do
should
i
express
even
a
wish
that
mr
faulkland
should
repair
the
niece
wrongs
by
marriage
mr
arnold
knows
nothing
of
miss
burchell
affair
i
went
once
so
far
as
to
say
i
had
heard
mr
faulkland
formerly
liked
this
young
lady
mr
arnold
answered
i
am
glad
it
went
no
farther
than
liking
if
it
had
probably
i
should
not
have
been
so
soon
delivered
from
my
thraldom
to
her
aunt
this
reply
silenced
me
i
am
exceedingly
perplexed
about
it
would
to
heaven
mr
faulkland
would
of
himself
think
of
doing
the
amiable
unhappy
girl
justice
my
mother
writes
me
word
that
sir
george
had
informed
mr
faulkland
by
letter
of
the
success
of
his
project
and
that
his
answer
was
full
of
congratulations
and
expressions
of
joy
he
is
now
in
italy
but
talks
of
returning
to
england
next
summer
he
says
he
hears
sometimes
from
pivet
and
that
he
and
his
wife
live
very
well
together
my
mother
says
she
often
sees
miss
burchell
and
that
she
encourages
her
with
the
hope
of
what
may
happen
when
mr
faulkland
comes
back
if
this
match
should
ever
take
place
it
would
give
me
most
sincere
satisfaction
the
girl
family
is
not
contemptible
her
fortune
is
pretty
large
her
person
lovely
the
unfortunate
false
step
she
made
is
an
entire
secret
except
to
the
persons
immediately
concerned
so
that
with
regard
to
the
world
her
character
too
is
good
mrs
gerrarde
at
worst
was
only
her
aunt
by
marriage
but
if
that
circumstance
should
be
the
only
rub
in
her
way
to
happiness
i
would
sooner
declare
the
whole
affair
and
run
the
risk
of
mr
arnold
being
let
into
this
ticklish
secret
than
be
a
hindrance
to
the
poor
young
creature
welfare
this
affair
never
comes
me
but
it
makes
me
sigh
god
send
a
favourable
issue
to
it
alas
my
cecilia
we
have
received
most
heavy
news
my
good
lord
v
that
stedfast
that
worthy
that
best
of
friends
is
no
more
he
was
preparing
to
go
to
v
hall
three
days
ago
but
was
seized
with
an
apoplexy
as
he
was
coming
down
stairs
to
go
into
his
coach
and
died
before
any
assistance
could
reach
him
oh
we
have
a
severe
loss
in
the
death
of
this
most
dear
and
valuable
man
but
why
do
i
mention
loss
his
lady
poor
lady
v
is
almost
distracted
and
well
she
may
the
best
of
husbands
fathers
every
thing
his
eldest
son
who
is
abroad
is
sent
for
home
on
this
melancholy
occasion
my
poor
mother
is
afflicted
exceedingly
every
body
that
knew
him
must
be
so
mr
arnold
and
i
have
lost
more
than
a
father
how
recurs
every
minute
let
me
think
of
lady
v
again
and
not
dare
to
complain
on
my
own
account
but
my
obligations
to
him
were
of
such
a
nature
as
claim
all
my
gratitude
to
his
memory
and
all
the
tears
that
i
have
abundantly
shed
for
him
mr
arnold
is
largely
in
his
debt
we
have
no
room
to
expect
the
same
friendship
from
the
present
lord
v
that
we
experienced
from
his
father
this
circumstance
did
not
occur
to
me
till
poor
mr
arnold
put
me
in
the
mind
of
it
my
thoughts
were
too
much
absorbed
in
grief
which
the
death
alone
of
our
friend
occasioned
my
mother
hinted
at
it
too
in
her
letter
to
mr
arnold
for
it
was
to
him
she
wrote
the
mournful
tidings
what
a
dark
cloud
of
sorrow
is
spread
over
and
how
this
stroke
has
imbittered
our
little
domestic
joys
but
let
me
not
carry
my
complainings
into
presumptuous
murmurings
i
have
lost
a
sincere
and
truly
valued
friend
but
do
i
not
still
possess
infinite
blessings
my
husband
my
dear
mr
arnold
my
two
sweet
children
the
best
of
mothers
and
thee
my
cecilia
whom
i
still
call
mine
though
at
such
a
distance
from
me
then
i
comfort
myself
with
reflecting
that
lady
v
has
sons
who
i
hope
will
be
a
blessing
to
her
that
her
fortune
is
affluent
and
that
my
lord
had
passed
through
a
life
to
a
pretty
advanced
age
he
was
turned
of
sixty
all
these
considerations
sooth
my
mind
and
i
acknowlege
that
upon
the
whole
i
have
by
far
more
cause
to
be
thankful
than
to
repine
lady
v
journey
down
to
v
hall
having
been
so
fatally
prevented
she
is
obliged
to
remain
in
london
the
shock
she
has
received
has
brought
on
her
a
fit
of
illness
i
find
my
lord
has
not
left
any
ready
money
his
fortune
was
large
but
as
they
always
lived
in
great
splendor
he
laid
none
of
his
income
by
the
whole
sum
which
he
could
command
he
laid
out
for
our
use
my
lady
jointure
is
pretty
considerable
if
it
were
ten
times
more
she
deserves
it
oh
may
her
sons
prove
worthy
of
such
a
parent
the
youngest
i
hear
is
a
very
fine
youth
he
is
come
to
her
from
oxford
to
comfort
her
till
the
arrival
of
his
elder
brother
my
mother
writes
me
word
that
her
old
friend
lady
grimston
is
dead
she
has
left
her
whole
fortune
to
charitable
uses
not
a
sixpence
to
either
of
her
daughters
poor
mrs
vere
she
is
content
with
her
little
income
and
has
no
loss
of
so
unnatural
a
parent
who
carried
her
vindictive
spirit
with
her
to
the
grave
as
for
the
eldest
she
did
not
stand
in
need
of
any
assistance
from
her
but
i
own
though
i
had
not
great
esteem
for
lady
grimston
i
could
not
help
being
shocked
at
the
brutal
behaviour
of
her
to
her
in
her
last
hours
she
had
never
seen
either
him
or
her
daughter
from
the
time
i
told
you
they
had
quarrelled
but
when
she
found
herself
dying
she
sent
a
message
to
this
favourite
daughter
desiring
to
see
her
her
husband
whether
out
of
disregard
to
the
old
lady
or
his
wife
or
both
absolutely
refused
to
let
her
go
my
mother
remarks
on
this
passage
in
these
words
was
this
unfortunate
parent
punished
in
kind
for
denying
her
late
husband
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
his
youngest
daughter
when
he
was
in
the
same
circumstances
with
herself
my
mother
is
nevertheless
very
much
troubled
for
the
death
of
her
old
acquaintance
who
she
says
was
a
valuable
woman
she
considers
her
decease
as
a
memento
which
warns
her
of
her
own
approaching
end
for
they
were
just
of
an
age
i
fear
my
mother
is
not
well
though
she
does
not
say
so
for
she
has
put
off
her
coming
to
without
giving
me
a
reason
for
it
i
thank
you
my
beloved
cecilia
for
your
cordial
wish
your
opinion
that
all
my
troubles
are
at
an
end
is
consonant
to
your
desires
but
i
doubt
far
from
the
real
fact
the
young
lord
v
is
returned
home
but
oh
how
unlike
that
honest
man
whose
title
and
fortune
he
inherits
how
deceived
were
his
worthy
parents
in
their
hopes
of
him
he
is
a
stranger
to
every
sentiment
of
virtue
i
have
had
a
letter
this
day
from
my
lady
v
wherein
she
laments
the
degeneracy
of
her
son
whom
they
were
made
to
believe
a
pattern
of
excellence
but
the
tutor
to
whom
they
entrusted
him
was
as
profligate
as
himself
in
short
she
says
he
is
quite
a
reprobate
she
has
not
the
least
authority
or
influence
over
him
she
laments
this
particularly
on
our
account
we
are
indebted
to
him
near
five
thousand
pounds
and
my
lady
says
she
fears
he
will
press
mr
arnold
he
is
profuse
she
says
in
his
expences
without
being
generous
what
can
we
do
my
dear
there
is
not
the
least
prospect
now
of
our
being
able
to
pay
this
money
but
by
selling
the
only
remaining
stake
we
have
left
had
my
lord
lived
he
made
us
hope
that
by
his
interest
he
could
procure
mr
arnold
some
employment
which
would
have
enabled
him
to
discharge
this
debt
at
his
ease
without
our
being
obliged
to
strip
ourselves
of
our
all
as
we
purposed
living
with
the
utmost
oeconomy
this
might
have
been
accomplished
in
a
few
years
this
prospect
is
now
lost
to
us
we
must
submit
i
have
begged
of
mr
arnold
to
think
immediately
of
selling
my
jointure
for
we
have
no
reason
to
expect
any
lenity
from
a
man
of
such
a
character
as
the
present
lord
v
is
we
can
subsist
upon
the
income
which
my
mother
is
so
good
as
to
allow
us
it
is
precarious
it
is
true
but
something
may
happen
i
rely
on
that
providence
who
has
hitherto
protected
me
lady
v
apprehensions
were
but
too
well
founded
we
have
had
a
letter
from
her
son
agent
the
debt
be
paid
and
we
are
come
to
a
resolution
to
sell
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
a
year
we
shall
then
have
but
fifty
pounds
a
year
in
the
world
which
we
can
call
our
own
i
reckon
not
upon
my
mother
life
these
afflictions
i
fear
will
hasten
her
departure
to
another
world
from
sir
george
we
have
nothing
to
expect
he
is
absorbed
in
vanity
his
new
alliances
engross
him
intirely
my
dear
lady
v
writes
us
word
she
will
do
her
utmost
to
promote
mr
arnold
interest
she
has
numerous
and
powerful
friends
and
says
she
makes
no
doubt
of
obtaining
something
for
him
worth
his
acceptance
believe
me
my
cecilia
i
am
not
disheartened
at
this
fresh
blow
if
my
dear
mr
arnold
could
reconcile
himself
to
it
i
could
be
well
contented
i
will
not
now
though
you
used
to
accuse
me
of
it
anticipate
misfortunes
we
have
still
enough
for
the
present
to
live
on
decently
and
if
my
lady
v
kind
endeavours
should
succeed
we
may
yet
be
happily
provided
for
i
will
not
let
the
thought
of
my
mother
death
interfere
let
me
but
calm
the
anxious
fears
of
my
poor
mr
arnold
and
all
will
be
well
thank
god
we
have
done
with
the
merciless
lord
v
his
money
is
to
be
paid
directly
to
him
i
have
recovered
my
tranquility
i
enjoy
my
little
in
peace
and
have
the
comfort
to
see
mr
arnold
mind
more
at
ease
and
reconciled
to
his
lot
to
lady
v
goodness
as
well
as
my
own
earnest
endeavours
i
impute
this
she
says
she
has
the
promise
of
an
honourable
and
a
profitable
post
for
him
but
we
are
to
wait
some
months
for
it
the
person
who
is
now
in
possession
of
this
place
is
to
be
preferred
to
a
better
and
she
says
she
has
the
word
of
an
man
on
the
occasion
is
a
very
man
too
says
my
lady
in
her
letter
but
as
it
is
on
the
first
part
of
his
character
chiefly
we
are
to
depend
i
mention
the
other
only
by
the
by
now
my
dear
have
i
not
reason
to
be
contented
a
thankless
heart
should
i
have
if
i
were
not
but
i
am
indeed
my
cecilia
i
am
and
i
begin
again
to
be
happy
our
domestick
felicity
was
but
disturbed
for
a
while
it
was
not
here
will
i
close
i
have
an
opportunity
of
sending
this
immediately
by
a
private
hand
to
my
beloved
mrs
arnold
maid
patty
continues
the
by
my
lady
orders
i
take
up
the
pen
and
she
has
charged
me
to
set
down
every
particular
god
knows
i
am
ill
able
to
do
it
but
i
will
strive
to
obey
her
my
poor
dear
lady
is
in
such
trouble
she
has
not
the
heart
to
write
nor
scarcely
to
do
any
thing
my
master
oh
madam
how
shall
i
express
myself
my
poor
master
now
he
is
so
good
we
are
going
i
fear
to
lose
him
i
must
write
according
to
my
lady
custom
every
thing
in
the
best
order
i
can
you
can
not
think
madam
how
happy
they
have
lived
together
ever
since
my
lady
came
home
to
him
again
he
seemed
to
grow
fonder
and
fonder
of
her
every
day
i
believe
he
perfectly
adored
her
and
he
had
reason
you
know
madam
my
lady
was
always
used
to
a
chariot
but
they
never
attempted
keeping
one
since
they
came
down
to
she
asked
my
master
once
if
he
had
a
horse
quiet
enough
for
her
to
venture
to
ride
on
to
church
i
observed
my
master
turned
away
his
face
and
put
his
handkerchief
to
his
eyes
i
believe
he
thought
of
a
little
favourite
pad
that
he
had
given
to
mrs
gerrarde
i
have
not
one
my
love
said
he
that
i
would
trust
you
on
you
had
once
a
pretty
horse
that
you
were
fond
of
but
my
desperate
folly
has
not
even
left
you
that
but
i
will
look
out
for
one
that
will
suit
you
no
matter
my
dear
said
my
lady
smiling
and
taking
him
by
the
hand
i
will
ride
double
i
think
that
will
suit
me
best
dearest
of
women
said
my
master
and
he
fetched
a
deep
sigh
when
shall
i
be
able
to
make
you
amends
he
lamented
hourly
the
loss
of
his
fortune
for
her
sake
what
will
become
of
you
my
dearest
creature
and
my
two
poor
children
said
he
when
he
was
obliged
to
part
with
her
jointure
if
i
should
die
before
you
and
then
he
cried
and
wrung
his
hands
my
lady
begged
of
him
to
put
such
melancholy
thoughts
out
of
his
head
saying
they
never
disturbed
her
i
hope
said
she
i
shall
never
see
your
death
but
if
it
pleases
god
to
punish
me
so
far
a
little
a
very
little
will
content
me
for
the
rest
of
my
days
my
master
embraced
her
and
the
sweet
children
and
said
if
heaven
spared
him
life
he
would
yet
be
the
happiest
man
in
the
world
many
a
time
have
i
been
witness
to
such
discourse
between
them
for
they
knew
my
love
for
them
was
so
great
that
they
would
never
scruple
talking
of
their
affairs
before
me
oh
madam
i
believe
there
was
never
a
truer
penitent
than
my
master
my
dear
lady
has
said
to
me
since
they
were
forced
to
sell
her
jointure
patty
though
we
are
now
reduced
to
little
more
than
two
hundred
pounds
a
year
i
have
much
more
comfort
than
when
we
had
twelve
i
have
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
mr
arnold
such
as
i
wish
him
he
is
an
altered
man
patty
he
is
truly
virtuous
and
i
am
sure
he
loves
me
now
from
right
reason
i
am
content
with
the
little
that
is
left
us
i
always
prayed
for
her
prosperity
but
madam
god
is
pleased
to
order
things
otherwise
than
we
poor
silly
mortalls
think
the
best
my
lady
has
always
been
good
and
pious
and
i
hope
he
will
yet
bring
her
out
of
her
troubles
tho
they
are
great
and
many
my
lady
always
charged
me
to
be
minute
and
to
write
particulars
but
good
madam
excuse
the
silly
way
i
put
my
words
together
i
have
not
yet
come
to
the
dismal
part
of
my
story
and
i
hardly
know
how
to
go
on
for
indeed
i
am
forced
to
break
off
every
now
and
then
to
cry
reason
enough
i
have
to
be
sure
but
what
is
sorrow
compared
to
my
lady
the
day
before
yesterday
my
master
was
asked
by
some
gentlemen
in
our
neighbourhood
to
go
a
hunting
he
had
no
mind
to
go
for
my
lady
was
not
very
well
and
he
was
unwilling
to
leave
her
but
she
persuaded
him
because
she
knew
he
loved
hunting
dearly
she
has
blamed
herself
for
it
ever
since
but
she
could
not
know
by
enchantment
what
was
to
happen
he
left
my
lady
in
bed
and
went
out
about
five
in
the
morning
at
eight
as
my
lady
was
sitting
at
breakfast
and
i
attending
the
other
maid
called
me
out
our
man
who
had
gone
abroad
with
my
master
was
in
the
kitchen
and
looked
as
pale
as
death
i
asked
him
what
was
the
matter
the
poor
fellow
could
hardly
speak
but
at
last
said
my
master
has
got
a
desperate
fall
in
leaping
a
ditch
and
i
am
afraid
has
hurt
his
skull
he
is
lying
at
farmer
hill
cottage
and
one
of
the
gentleman
is
rid
off
for
a
surgeon
but
that
is
no
place
for
him
we
must
get
him
home
but
i
thought
it
best
to
prepare
my
lady
before
she
sees
him
my
lady
rung
her
bell
before
i
could
answer
him
i
ran
in
but
i
am
sure
i
looked
like
a
ghost
for
my
lady
started
when
she
saw
me
bless
me
patty
said
she
what
is
the
matter
has
any
thing
happened
to
your
master
not
much
madam
said
i
he
is
killed
she
cried
and
sprung
out
of
her
chair
indeed
he
is
not
madam
i
answered
standing
between
her
and
the
door
but
he
has
got
a
fall
and
is
a
little
hurt
she
made
me
no
answer
but
flew
down
stairs
out
at
the
front
door
and
down
the
avenue
as
quick
as
an
arrow
i
ran
after
her
and
the
other
servants
after
me
we
could
not
overtake
her
but
she
was
soon
stopped
for
she
met
my
poor
master
borne
by
four
men
i
suppose
she
thought
he
was
dead
for
she
fainted
away
directly
and
we
carried
her
in
after
him
my
master
was
put
he
was
alive
but
not
able
to
speak
he
had
got
a
dreadful
cut
in
his
head
and
was
sadly
bruised
besides
as
soon
as
my
lady
came
to
herself
we
told
her
my
master
was
not
killed
she
went
into
his
room
but
had
not
power
to
speak
but
sat
like
a
stone
statue
at
his
the
surgeon
came
in
less
than
half
an
hour
i
believe
he
is
but
a
sorry
one
for
after
he
had
dressed
the
wound
he
said
there
was
no
danger
in
it
at
first
we
were
all
in
hopes
that
it
was
so
for
about
two
my
master
got
his
speech
again
he
complained
of
sickness
at
his
stomach
and
violent
pains
all
over
him
my
lady
on
hearing
him
speak
seemed
to
be
rouzed
as
if
out
of
a
deep
sleep
several
of
the
gentlemen
who
had
been
out
with
my
master
had
come
to
enquire
how
he
did
and
though
some
of
them
came
into
his
chamber
my
mistress
did
not
speak
nor
seem
to
regard
any
of
them
the
first
word
she
uttered
was
to
call
me
patty
said
she
what
is
the
reason
i
do
not
see
mr
main
here
it
was
my
brother
she
meant
who
is
a
surgeon
and
i
believe
madam
she
has
mentioned
him
to
you
as
one
that
is
reckoned
pretty
skilful
in
his
business
one
of
the
gentlemen
immediately
said
by
all
means
let
him
be
sent
for
directly
my
brother
was
soon
fetched
and
he
thought
proper
to
bleed
my
master
in
the
arm
he
would
not
take
the
dressings
off
his
head
as
the
other
surgeon
had
declared
the
skull
was
not
touched
but
said
he
would
be
present
when
the
wound
was
dressed
the
next
day
and
would
watch
all
night
by
my
master
my
lady
was
not
to
be
removed
from
the
nor
could
we
persuade
her
to
take
any
sustenance
the
whole
day
my
poor
master
was
in
a
high
fever
all
night
and
i
thought
he
strove
to
stifle
his
groans
that
my
lady
might
not
hear
them
she
did
for
all
that
and
i
am
sure
every
one
of
them
was
worse
than
a
dagger
to
her
heart
she
stole
out
of
the
room
several
times
for
a
minute
and
i
could
hear
her
bursting
into
tears
as
soon
as
she
was
without
side
the
door
then
she
would
come
in
again
and
sit
by
him
till
her
heart
was
again
so
full
she
was
forced
to
go
out
to
give
it
vent
the
whole
night
passed
over
in
this
dismal
way
when
my
master
head
was
examined
the
next
day
my
brother
found
that
the
skull
was
not
touched
where
he
had
received
the
cut
but
that
it
was
broke
in
two
other
places
and
in
so
dangerous
a
way
that
it
was
impossible
to
save
his
life
as
it
was
not
in
a
part
where
he
could
be
trepanned
the
other
surgeon
who
found
he
had
been
mistaken
at
first
now
joined
with
my
brother
in
opinion
that
the
world
could
not
save
my
master
life
oh
madam
if
you
had
seen
my
lady
when
this
was
declared
to
her
i
shall
never
forget
her
looks
i
remember
a
piece
of
fine
painting
at
your
house
which
i
used
to
hear
your
family
commend
mightily
it
was
the
picture
of
despair
my
lady
put
me
in
mind
of
this
piece
she
had
the
very
countenance
of
it
but
i
think
if
she
had
then
sat
to
a
painter
he
could
have
made
a
stronger
and
more
look
even
than
that
picture
has
such
another
dismal
day
and
night
i
believe
never
was
passed
in
this
house
my
brother
staid
with
us
though
he
could
do
but
little
service
except
to
watch
my
poor
master
for
he
was
between
whiles
quite
out
of
his
reason
no
rest
did
my
lady
take
all
last
night
she
could
not
be
got
out
of
the
room
she
has
tasted
nothing
these
two
days
nor
slept
a
wink
these
two
nights
she
will
destroy
herself
what
will
become
of
us
i
have
wrote
to
my
lady
bidulph
to
let
her
know
the
deplorable
condition
we
are
all
in
my
god
what
will
become
of
the
poor
children
if
my
lady
goes
on
at
this
rate
she
can
not
hold
out
to
be
sure
such
a
load
of
sorrow
at
her
heart
without
nourishment
or
sleep
oh
my
good
madam
i
am
not
able
to
go
on
with
my
task
we
have
not
the
least
hopes
in
the
world
my
master
grows
worse
and
worse
every
hour
he
has
his
reason
now
and
is
sensible
that
he
is
dying
heaven
knows
if
i
could
lay
down
my
life
to
save
his
how
gladly
would
i
do
it
i
should
be
no
loss
but
he
will
be
a
grievous
one
lord
help
me
i
am
not
able
to
go
on
i
have
writ
this
by
bits
and
scraps
main
in
three
in
the
mr
arnold
had
been
delirious
the
greatest
part
of
yesterday
but
about
six
in
the
evening
having
come
a
little
to
his
senses
he
was
conscious
that
he
was
going
fast
and
desired
that
prayers
might
be
read
by
him
his
lady
sent
for
the
minister
of
the
parish
but
he
was
gone
to
london
the
gentleman
whom
he
had
left
to
do
his
duty
was
taken
ill
the
night
before
and
was
not
able
to
leave
his
bed
he
sent
the
messager
that
went
for
him
to
another
clergyman
who
lived
about
four
miles
farther
off
to
request
he
would
attend
in
his
stead
but
he
was
engaged
on
the
same
duty
in
his
own
parish
and
could
not
come
he
said
till
next
morning
the
servant
had
wasted
above
two
hours
on
this
errand
it
was
nine
when
he
returned
mr
arnold
during
this
interval
had
had
several
ramblings
but
was
now
again
a
little
composed
though
apparently
worse
i
whispered
the
apothecary
who
just
then
came
in
that
he
could
not
live
morning
mrs
arnold
observed
me
and
begged
to
know
what
i
said
i
told
her
tenderly
that
i
feared
mr
atkins
that
was
the
clergyman
name
would
arrive
too
late
if
he
deferred
his
visit
next
day
she
made
me
no
answer
but
seemed
to
study
a
little
then
went
composedly
to
mr
arnold
my
dear
said
she
mr
downs
is
unluckily
from
home
his
assistant
is
sick
in
bed
and
we
can
not
tonight
get
any
other
clergyman
to
visit
you
but
as
you
are
desirous
of
offering
up
your
prayers
to
almighty
god
i
hope
it
will
not
be
improper
if
i
read
the
service
for
the
sick
by
you
he
stretched
out
his
hand
towards
her
and
said
in
a
faint
yet
eager
voice
do
do
my
good
angel
tears
stood
in
the
lady
eyes
as
she
turned
from
him
but
she
quickly
wiped
them
off
and
requested
of
me
and
the
apothecary
to
join
with
her
in
the
solemn
office
she
was
going
to
perform
which
she
said
though
she
was
sensible
it
was
an
irregular
act
yet
she
hoped
from
the
necessity
of
the
case
would
be
accepted
in
the
sight
of
god
she
ordered
my
sister
to
fetch
her
a
and
then
kneeled
down
at
mr
arnold
surely
nothing
ever
appeared
so
graceful
her
fine
hands
and
her
fine
eyes
lifted
up
to
heaven
while
the
book
lay
open
before
her
on
a
little
table
such
a
reverential
such
an
ardent
yet
such
a
mournful
supplication
in
those
fine
eyes
she
looked
like
something
more
than
human
after
having
in
this
posture
offered
up
a
short
petition
in
silence
she
began
the
service
never
did
i
see
true
devotion
before
the
fervor
of
her
looks
and
the
tone
of
her
voice
was
such
you
would
have
thought
she
beheld
her
creator
with
her
bodily
eyes
for
my
part
i
looked
on
her
with
such
reverence
that
she
appeared
to
me
like
an
angel
interceding
for
us
poor
mortal
sinners
she
went
through
the
office
with
admirable
strength
of
mind
omitting
the
exhortation
she
came
to
that
part
of
the
prayer
which
says
for
as
much
as
in
all
appearance
the
time
of
his
dissolution
draweth
nigh
c
here
her
voice
faultered
and
she
stopped
but
soon
recovered
herself
and
proceeded
with
an
unbroken
tone
to
the
end
every
one
present
wept
but
herself
she
thanked
us
for
our
kindness
in
staying
and
begged
we
would
continue
by
poor
mr
arnold
while
there
was
the
least
possibility
of
administering
any
relief
to
him
i
told
her
i
would
most
willingly
obey
her
commands
and
sit
up
all
the
night
with
him
though
it
was
not
in
human
power
to
give
him
any
assistance
she
repeated
her
thanks
and
then
sitting
down
by
the
remained
composed
and
silent
about
twelve
finding
mr
arnold
speechless
i
entreated
her
to
retire
to
her
own
chamber
and
if
she
could
not
sleep
to
take
some
little
refreshment
for
she
had
taken
nothing
that
whole
day
nor
for
the
two
preceding
ones
but
a
dish
of
tea
which
my
sister
had
forced
on
her
mr
main
said
she
suffer
me
to
continue
a
little
longer
my
task
will
soon
be
over
i
was
unwilling
to
urge
her
and
she
remained
sitting
in
her
place
about
two
we
heard
mr
arnold
give
a
deep
groan
he
is
gone
said
she
and
started
off
her
chair
i
stepped
to
his
and
found
indeed
he
had
breathed
his
last
she
snatched
up
one
of
his
hands
that
lay
upon
the
coverlid
of
the
bed
held
it
for
near
a
minute
to
her
lips
and
then
without
any
audible
token
of
grief
went
out
of
the
room
i
pray
god
to
support
and
comfort
this
excellent
woman
in
amen
amen
sure
my
dear
unhappy
lady
is
enough
to
break
one
heart
to
see
her
i
was
not
able
to
go
on
good
madam
and
begged
of
my
brother
to
set
down
what
happened
and
he
has
put
it
in
better
words
than
i
could
my
lady
shut
herself
up
for
the
remainder
of
the
night
and
would
not
suffer
any
one
to
come
near
her
it
is
easy
to
guess
how
she
spent
her
time
rest
to
be
sure
she
took
none
she
could
not
if
she
had
been
inclined
for
there
was
no
bed
in
the
chamber
where
she
locked
herself
up
in
the
morning
a
lady
who
is
our
neighbour
a
worthy
good
woman
came
in
her
own
coach
and
took
away
my
lady
and
the
two
children
she
neither
consented
nor
refused
but
seemed
to
let
us
do
what
we
would
with
her
for
she
said
nothing
but
suffered
the
lady
and
me
to
lead
her
down
stairs
and
put
her
into
the
coach
but
the
sight
of
the
two
children
threw
her
into
such
an
agony
that
i
thought
i
should
have
died
on
the
spot
only
with
seeing
her
i
have
writ
again
to
lady
bidulph
if
she
is
able
to
be
sure
she
will
come
down
but
i
had
rather
she
would
send
for
my
lady
for
this
is
a
sorrowful
place
for
her
to
stay
in
my
lady
has
received
a
message
from
her
mother
desiring
her
to
come
to
town
directly
with
the
children
she
says
she
is
not
able
to
come
down
for
her
as
her
health
is
but
bad
and
my
lady
v
has
been
so
good
as
to
send
down
her
own
coach
to
carry
the
little
family
to
town
my
brother
has
taken
the
care
of
my
master
funeral
upon
himself
he
is
to
be
carried
to
the
family
burying
place
at
as
soon
as
that
is
over
we
must
try
to
get
my
lady
to
town
she
has
no
business
to
go
into
her
own
lonely
house
again
it
would
be
enough
to
kill
her
thank
god
we
have
got
back
safe
to
london
my
lady
keeps
up
wonderfully
under
the
load
of
grief
that
she
has
at
her
heart
she
does
not
complain
nor
lament
herself
as
i
have
seen
some
do
who
have
not
been
in
half
her
trouble
she
hardly
spoke
a
word
during
her
whole
journey
and
strove
as
much
as
possible
not
to
cry
but
i
could
observe
that
she
never
turned
her
eyes
on
the
two
little
babes
one
of
whom
sat
on
my
lap
and
the
other
beside
me
but
the
tears
ran
down
her
cheeks
it
was
a
doleful
sight
the
meeting
between
her
and
my
lady
bidulph
the
poor
old
lady
grieves
sadly
and
looks
mighty
ill
i
am
afraid
she
will
not
hold
out
long
she
has
had
great
trials
for
a
lady
so
far
in
years
sir
george
came
to
see
my
lady
he
looked
troubled
i
hope
he
will
be
good
to
her
my
lady
asked
me
this
morning
if
i
had
thought
of
keeping
any
journal
for
this
fortnight
past
i
told
her
i
had
and
she
desired
to
see
it
she
shed
so
many
tears
while
she
read
it
that
the
paper
was
quite
wet
when
she
gave
it
to
me
again
she
ordered
me
to
make
up
the
packet
and
send
it
off
as
she
was
not
in
a
condition
to
add
any
thing
to
it
herself
arnold
in
yes
my
dear
cecilia
i
have
need
of
the
tender
condolements
with
which
your
last
packet
was
filled
well
may
you
call
me
a
child
of
affliction
i
am
now
so
exercised
in
sorrows
that
i
look
forward
to
nothing
else
patty
i
find
has
been
a
faithful
journalist
and
has
carried
down
her
melancholy
narrative
to
this
day
this
day
on
which
for
the
first
time
i
have
taken
a
pen
in
my
hand
for
more
than
two
months
but
my
eyes
are
much
better
and
i
hope
i
shall
not
have
occasion
for
the
assistance
of
her
pen
unless
some
new
calamity
should
again
disqualify
me
from
using
my
own
yet
in
the
midst
of
my
griefs
ought
i
not
to
return
thanks
to
heaven
that
i
have
such
an
asylum
to
fly
to
as
the
arms
of
one
of
the
best
of
mothers
oh
my
dear
while
i
have
her
i
ought
not
to
say
that
i
have
lost
every
thing
sir
george
has
been
more
obliging
since
my
fatal
loss
than
he
was
before
but
still
there
wants
that
cordial
heart
which
he
formerly
had
as
for
his
lady
i
know
very
little
of
her
she
came
to
see
me
twice
since
my
arrival
in
town
in
all
the
formal
parade
of
a
state
visit
how
ill
does
the
vanity
of
pomp
suit
with
a
house
of
mourning
her
visits
were
short
formal
and
cold
she
seems
to
be
intolerably
proud
and
i
thought
looked
as
if
she
was
disgusted
at
visiting
people
in
lodgings
who
were
so
nearly
related
to
her
my
brother
and
she
are
to
go
down
this
summer
into
scotland
to
see
a
nobleman
who
is
her
uncle
by
her
mother
side
she
is
ridiculously
vain
of
her
family
and
has
taught
sir
george
to
be
so
too
so
that
now
he
hardly
vouchsafes
to
own
a
relation
that
is
untitled
lady
v
whose
friendship
has
been
one
of
the
chief
resources
of
comfort
to
me
went
out
of
town
this
morning
she
is
retired
for
life
i
fear
to
a
distant
part
of
lancashire
in
order
to
spend
the
rest
of
her
days
with
her
eldest
sister
a
widow
lady
of
whom
she
is
very
fond
her
son
ill
behaviour
has
disgusted
her
so
she
has
broke
with
him
intirely
her
younger
son
is
gone
into
the
army
not
i
find
with
her
approbation
and
she
told
me
she
has
nothing
now
worth
living
for
at
least
nothing
for
which
she
should
subject
herself
to
the
cares
of
life
she
insisted
on
my
corresponding
with
her
and
renewed
her
assurances
of
that
kind
attachment
which
i
have
already
so
strongly
experienced
at
another
time
the
loss
of
this
dear
woman
society
would
have
affected
me
more
sensibly
but
i
am
so
inured
to
disappointment
and
grief
that
i
am
almost
become
a
stoic
patty
has
already
informed
you
that
miss
burchell
is
often
with
us
she
is
more
sollicitous
more
assiduous
than
ever
in
her
attendance
on
my
mother
i
find
she
even
sat
up
with
her
two
nights
on
an
illness
which
seized
her
on
her
first
hearing
the
news
of
my
misfortune
poor
girl
my
mother
tells
me
she
went
so
far
as
to
express
her
apprehensions
on
my
being
again
single
but
my
mother
quieted
her
fears
on
that
head
not
without
a
soft
reprimand
for
her
doubting
by
putting
her
in
mind
that
besides
the
circumstances
not
being
altered
in
regard
to
her
she
had
received
my
solemn
promise
that
whenever
it
was
in
my
power
i
would
use
my
whole
influence
whatever
that
might
be
in
her
favour
i
did
make
her
such
a
promise
and
shall
fulfil
it
to
the
utmost
mr
faulkland
absence
from
the
kingdom
hitherto
put
it
out
of
my
power
nor
would
i
without
my
beloved
mr
arnold
participation
have
ever
attempted
it
had
he
lived
fully
restored
as
i
was
to
his
confidence
and
good
opinion
i
should
have
ventured
to
disclose
the
secret
to
him
and
got
him
to
join
with
me
in
such
measures
as
i
should
have
thought
best
for
miss
burchell
happiness
it
now
rests
upon
myself
alone
and
i
will
leave
nothing
unattempted
to
serve
her
you
will
be
surprized
perhaps
my
cecilia
when
i
tell
you
that
mr
faulkland
is
now
in
england
miss
burchell
told
me
so
this
day
she
mentioned
it
in
a
careless
manner
rather
directing
her
discourse
to
my
mother
she
had
too
much
delicacy
to
hint
at
consequences
of
any
kind
from
this
circumstance
and
quickly
turned
from
the
subject
my
mother
asked
her
impatiently
when
he
came
where
he
was
and
several
other
questions
to
none
of
which
she
could
give
any
answer
but
that
she
heard
he
had
been
returned
above
three
months
and
was
at
his
seat
in
hertfordshire
i
am
surprized
sir
george
never
mentioned
this
to
me
to
be
sure
he
knew
it
he
is
not
extremely
nice
in
his
notions
however
this
is
a
decorum
for
which
i
am
obliged
to
him
lady
v
doubtless
was
ignorant
of
it
or
she
would
have
told
me
there
is
nothing
now
to
prevent
me
from
warmly
interfering
for
miss
burchell
charming
young
woman
how
is
she
to
be
pitied
the
tedious
years
of
suspence
of
almost
hopeless
love
that
she
has
passed
deserve
a
recompence
and
her
little
boy
my
mother
tells
me
is
a
lovely
creature
miss
burchell
brought
him
once
to
see
my
mother
mr
faulkland
former
visits
the
child
often
and
has
brought
his
mother
frequent
and
large
supplies
for
his
use
i
told
miss
burchell
at
parting
that
i
had
not
forgot
my
promise
and
that
as
soon
as
decency
would
permit
nothing
should
hinder
me
from
being
a
most
strenuous
advocate
for
her
she
squeezed
my
hand
and
whispered
dear
madam
my
fate
is
in
your
power
i
would
it
were
then
should
she
soon
be
happy
but
i
will
acquit
myself
as
far
as
i
am
able
i
was
prevailed
on
to
dine
at
my
brother
the
first
time
that
i
have
been
abroad
ever
since
i
came
to
town
i
had
no
mind
to
go
but
my
mother
not
being
well
had
excused
herself
and
she
said
it
would
be
taken
amiss
if
i
did
so
too
lady
sarah
herself
having
made
the
invitation
her
ladyship
said
i
need
not
be
fearful
of
meeting
strangers
at
her
house
as
it
was
to
be
a
private
day
so
much
the
better
thought
i
nothing
else
should
induce
me
to
go
it
was
the
first
time
i
ever
was
in
sir
george
house
which
is
a
very
magnificent
one
within
a
door
or
two
of
mr
faulkland
in
st
as
lady
sarah
did
not
approve
of
that
which
he
had
before
but
my
dear
the
ostentation
of
this
woman
made
me
sick
such
a
parade
of
grandeur
such
an
unnecessary
display
of
state
and
splendor
i
thought
looked
like
an
insult
upon
me
i
was
carried
into
a
most
sumptuous
but
as
this
was
a
private
day
as
she
called
it
the
furniture
was
all
covered
up
with
and
the
room
having
been
newly
washed
felt
extremely
cold
i
was
told
her
ladyship
was
dressing
though
it
was
then
as
i
imagined
her
after
i
had
shivered
here
for
about
half
an
hour
lady
sarah
woman
came
to
desire
me
to
walk
up
stairs
as
the
woman
did
not
know
me
and
from
the
little
ceremony
she
saw
me
treated
with
concluded
i
was
some
humble
visitor
she
took
me
up
the
back
stairs
to
her
lady
where
i
found
lady
sarah
who
was
not
yet
half
dressed
in
consultation
with
her
millener
the
woman
was
trying
some
on
her
before
the
glass
she
made
me
a
very
slight
apology
for
having
kept
me
waiting
so
long
and
to
mend
the
matter
told
me
as
she
was
not
near
ready
if
i
chose
looking
at
the
house
i
should
have
time
enough
to
do
it
before
dinner
i
thanked
her
but
said
i
had
already
sat
so
long
in
the
cold
that
i
felt
myself
chilled
and
with
her
ladyship
permission
would
place
myself
at
her
till
dinner
was
ready
she
asked
her
woman
carelessly
why
i
had
not
been
shewn
into
the
she
then
turned
to
her
millener
again
to
whom
she
gave
a
particular
charge
to
have
a
suit
of
very
rich
point
which
she
had
fixed
on
done
up
for
her
against
the
next
night
by
which
i
found
my
sister
was
going
to
throw
off
her
mourning
intirely
that
which
she
had
on
being
so
slight
that
it
was
scarcely
to
be
distinguished
for
such
my
brother
entered
the
room
while
she
was
thus
employed
and
having
saluted
me
looked
at
his
watch
and
asked
lady
sarah
had
she
ordered
dinner
later
than
usual
she
told
him
she
had
ordered
it
half
an
hour
later
than
ordinary
as
she
had
a
mind
to
make
a
long
morning
having
dedicated
it
to
with
whom
she
had
a
hundred
things
to
settle
my
brother
cast
a
at
me
i
thought
he
looked
a
little
abashed
at
the
impertinence
and
of
his
wife
lady
sarah
had
by
this
time
huddled
on
her
cloaths
a
laced
footman
appeared
at
the
door
who
summoned
us
by
a
silent
bow
to
dinner
the
millener
gathered
up
her
frippery
and
put
them
into
a
telling
her
she
would
wait
on
her
ladyship
again
lady
sarah
answered
you
have
got
a
monstrous
way
to
go
mrs
i
forget
the
name
and
as
i
have
not
half
done
with
you
yet
you
may
stay
and
dine
here
as
we
are
alone
and
i
will
look
over
the
rest
of
the
things
in
the
evening
as
i
shall
not
have
another
leisure
day
while
i
am
in
town
this
was
going
a
little
too
far
sir
george
felt
it
i
believe
lady
sarah
said
he
this
gentlewoman
has
a
coach
waiting
for
her
at
the
door
he
had
seen
it
for
he
was
but
just
come
in
perhaps
it
may
be
inconvenient
to
detain
her
she
may
leave
the
things
and
call
another
time
the
woman
took
the
hint
though
she
before
seemed
inclined
to
accept
of
the
honour
lady
sarah
had
done
her
she
made
her
and
withdrew
as
this
however
had
brought
on
a
variety
of
fresh
instructions
it
detained
us
so
long
that
the
dinner
was
quite
cold
nor
was
our
repast
had
it
even
been
warm
by
any
means
answerable
to
the
elegance
of
the
service
the
superb
sideboard
and
the
number
of
attendants
in
short
the
dinner
was
composed
of
a
parcel
of
dishes
that
looked
like
the
fragments
of
a
feast
you
know
there
is
nobody
more
indifferent
to
the
pleasures
of
the
table
than
i
am
yet
i
own
that
this
joined
to
the
rest
of
this
foolish
woman
behaviour
nettled
me
extremely
there
was
such
a
mixture
of
sordidness
and
vanity
in
the
whole
apparatus
as
made
it
truly
contemptible
i
made
haste
to
put
an
end
to
my
visit
as
soon
as
i
possibly
could
after
dinner
with
a
resolution
never
to
repeat
it
from
these
few
sketches
of
lady
sarah
you
may
form
some
kind
of
an
idea
of
what
sort
of
creature
it
is
i
should
pity
sir
george
but
that
i
think
her
disposition
is
not
extremely
opposite
to
his
own
i
am
told
that
the
widow
arnold
is
actually
married
to
that
vile
attorney
who
was
the
contriver
and
more
than
partner
in
her
iniquity
i
am
really
glad
she
has
lost
the
name
of
a
family
to
which
she
was
a
disgrace
now
believes
that
i
and
my
children
have
been
greatly
injured
but
how
unavailing
is
compassion
it
only
mortifies
when
it
is
expressed
by
the
pitying
words
and
looks
of
people
who
have
it
neither
in
their
power
nor
inclination
to
assist
you
this
mrs
arnold
bad
as
she
is
is
visited
and
caressed
favour
always
follows
the
fortunate
this
day
sir
george
and
his
lady
set
out
for
scotland
he
came
to
take
his
leave
of
us
but
made
an
apology
for
lady
sarah
whose
hurry
would
not
permit
her
to
call
on
us
my
brother
says
they
shall
stay
some
months
at
her
uncle
lord
k
he
told
me
at
parting
he
should
write
to
me
as
soon
as
he
got
to
his
journey
end
having
something
very
particular
to
say
to
me
i
have
read
over
my
journal
of
the
last
fortnight
and
am
startled
to
think
what
a
poor
insignificant
being
i
am
not
a
single
act
worth
recording
even
to
my
whole
life
perhaps
may
have
passed
so
yet
one
is
apt
to
fancy
that
they
are
doing
something
of
importance
while
they
are
engaged
in
the
little
bustle
of
the
world
be
it
in
ever
so
trifling
a
manner
and
when
you
find
you
have
a
variety
of
incidents
to
relate
in
which
you
yourself
were
concerned
that
your
time
has
not
been
spent
in
vain
but
for
these
last
fourteen
days
had
i
kept
a
journal
for
my
cat
i
think
i
should
have
had
as
much
to
say
for
her
i
shall
grow
busy
again
i
have
received
the
promised
letter
from
sir
george
an
extraordinary
one
it
is
but
i
will
not
anticipate
the
contents
read
them
yourself
dear
sidney
i
have
a
serious
subject
to
offer
to
your
consideration
which
made
me
the
rather
chuse
to
engage
your
attention
in
this
manner
than
in
a
conversation
between
ourselves
liable
as
that
would
be
to
interruptions
objections
and
frivolous
punctilios
from
which
you
have
already
suffered
so
severely
i
have
paid
so
much
regard
to
that
decorum
of
which
you
are
so
fond
as
never
to
have
mentioned
mr
faulkland
name
to
you
since
you
were
become
a
widow
though
it
is
near
four
months
since
he
returned
to
england
as
i
kept
up
a
correspondence
with
him
when
he
was
abroad
you
may
be
sure
i
informed
him
of
your
reconciliation
to
your
late
husband
a
reconciliation
which
if
you
thought
it
a
happiness
to
you
you
were
indebted
to
faulkland
for
this
single
circumstance
it
was
that
inclined
him
to
return
to
england
which
otherwise
perhaps
he
would
never
again
have
seen
though
the
necessity
of
his
affairs
here
which
he
had
left
at
random
required
his
presence
to
avoid
giving
umbrage
to
your
husband
he
repaired
privately
to
his
house
in
the
country
where
i
paid
him
a
visit
few
of
his
friends
except
myself
knew
of
his
being
in
the
kingdom
remember
sidney
the
great
obligations
you
have
to
mr
faulkland
and
let
that
prepare
your
mind
for
what
i
am
going
to
say
you
are
now
become
a
free
woman
faulkland
loves
you
still
with
an
unparallel
affection
i
had
a
letter
from
him
soon
after
your
arrival
in
town
wherein
he
mentions
the
revival
of
his
hopes
from
your
present
situation
and
intreats
me
to
be
mindful
of
his
interest
he
charged
me
however
not
to
mention
his
name
to
you
till
a
decent
time
was
passed
otherwise
probably
you
would
have
been
acquainted
with
these
particulars
sooner
but
faulkland
himself
has
a
little
too
much
of
that
ridiculous
nicety
which
you
admire
so
i
think
i
have
waited
till
a
decent
time
as
you
have
now
been
almost
three
months
a
widow
i
have
very
little
reason
to
imagine
that
influence
on
this
occasion
will
have
any
weight
either
with
you
or
my
mother
i
have
had
proofs
of
this
already
but
i
hope
you
will
not
be
so
blind
to
your
own
interest
as
to
refuse
the
good
that
fortune
once
more
throws
at
your
feet
i
can
hardly
suppose
you
so
weak
as
to
let
the
absurd
objection
which
formerly
prevented
your
happiness
still
prevail
with
you
to
reject
the
same
happiness
so
unexpectedly
again
offered
to
your
acceptance
my
mother
and
you
have
by
this
time
learnt
how
to
forgive
indeed
you
forgave
such
enormities
that
transgression
in
comparison
of
them
was
innocence
but
i
will
not
reproach
the
memory
of
the
dead
whatever
pretence
you
might
formerly
have
had
to
carry
your
punctilios
to
an
extraordinary
height
certain
circumstances
in
your
life
have
now
made
your
situation
very
different
you
are
destitute
of
fortune
incumbered
with
children
reflect
on
this
and
let
your
own
imagination
supply
the
rest
to
but
yourself
i
should
think
all
that
i
have
said
needless
but
i
know
the
minds
that
i
have
to
deal
with
i
must
take
this
opportunity
of
telling
you
that
i
am
surprized
at
my
mother
continued
attachment
to
miss
burchell
she
is
an
artful
creature
and
i
think
by
no
means
a
proper
acquaintance
for
you
i
am
far
from
wishing
to
injure
her
but
such
an
intimacy
may
be
dangerous
you
will
certainly
hear
from
faulkland
before
it
be
long
i
repeat
it
again
you
owe
him
more
than
ever
you
will
be
able
to
repay
the
recompence
he
deserves
will
ensure
your
own
happiness
and
prosperity
your
gratitude
as
well
as
your
prudence
will
now
be
put
to
the
test
and
your
conduct
on
this
occasion
will
determine
me
as
to
the
light
in
which
i
shall
henceforth
consider
you
present
my
duty
to
my
mother
lady
sarah
desires
her
service
may
be
accepted
i
am
what
a
letter
is
this
my
sister
but
sir
george
is
still
himself
gross
void
of
sentiment
he
dreams
of
nothing
but
the
glaring
advantages
that
fortune
and
rank
in
life
procure
and
how
he
argues
too
weak
arguer
he
not
suppose
that
the
absurd
he
calls
it
formerly
prevented
my
happiness
should
still
prevail
with
me
to
reject
the
same
why
not
is
the
nature
of
mr
faulkland
offence
changed
has
he
ever
repaired
it
has
not
miss
burchell
the
same
claim
she
ever
had
nay
a
stronger
than
ever
if
years
of
unabated
love
can
give
it
her
mother
and
i
have
by
this
time
learnt
to
forgive
human
frailties
nay
we
forgave
unkind
brother
to
rake
up
the
unfortunate
ashes
of
my
beloved
we
have
indeed
learnt
to
forgive
human
frailties
but
they
were
the
frailties
of
a
husband
a
repenting
husband
who
was
seduced
to
the
commission
of
those
crimes
which
he
abhorred
but
surely
that
is
no
plea
for
my
overlooking
the
faults
of
another
to
whom
i
am
under
no
such
tie
i
am
now
fortune
and
incumbered
with
indelicate
man
does
he
think
an
argument
in
favour
of
his
proposal
it
is
a
strong
one
against
it
shall
i
who
when
i
was
in
the
of
youth
flattered
with
some
advantages
of
person
which
time
and
grief
have
since
impaired
and
not
destitute
of
fortune
i
who
then
rejected
mr
faulkland
from
motives
which
still
subsist
shall
i
now
that
i
have
lost
those
advantages
meanly
condescend
to
accept
of
this
rejected
man
this
would
indeed
be
acknowleging
that
the
humiliating
change
had
levelled
me
to
those
principles
which
i
formerly
contemned
would
lay
me
under
mortifying
obligations
to
mr
faulkland
and
destroy
the
merit
of
that
refusal
which
proceeded
from
such
justifiable
motives
no
my
sordid
brother
if
i
recompence
mr
faulkland
as
he
deserves
at
my
hands
i
do
it
but
with
such
a
mind
as
i
bear
it
can
not
be
done
your
way
i
say
nothing
of
the
promise
i
made
miss
burchell
if
i
had
never
made
her
such
my
sentiments
would
be
the
same
from
those
other
considerations
but
such
a
promise
binding
as
it
is
determined
my
conduct
beyond
the
possibility
of
a
doubt
how
unreasonable
are
sir
george
prejudices
with
regard
to
this
unhappy
young
creature
he
is
for
ever
throwing
out
some
invective
against
her
it
is
cruel
but
i
am
tempted
to
forgive
him
as
i
know
it
proceeds
from
his
attachment
to
his
friend
he
need
not
put
me
in
mind
of
the
gratitude
i
owe
mr
faulkland
i
am
thoroughly
sensible
of
it
but
sir
george
and
i
differ
widely
in
our
ideas
of
expressing
this
gratitude
my
in
this
affair
is
to
determine
him
as
to
the
light
in
which
he
is
hereafter
to
consider
why
be
it
so
he
has
long
lost
the
tenderness
of
a
brother
for
me
i
will
not
regain
it
at
the
expence
of
my
honour
i
know
the
worst
that
can
befall
me
is
poverty
i
have
already
experienced
almost
every
possible
ill
in
life
but
that
and
for
that
i
am
prepared
but
i
will
not
call
myself
poor
while
i
have
an
upright
heart
to
support
me
and
the
means
poor
and
despicable
as
they
are
of
sustaining
life
but
what
do
i
call
despicable
have
i
not
an
estate
my
dear
a
whole
fifty
pounds
a
year
that
i
can
call
my
own
this
much
was
reserved
to
me
out
of
my
jointure
when
the
rest
was
sold
and
on
this
whenever
it
pleases
heaven
to
take
my
mother
away
will
i
retire
to
some
cottage
in
a
cheap
country
where
my
two
children
and
i
will
live
and
smile
at
the
rich
and
the
great
my
brother
letter
has
vexed
and
disgusted
me
exceedingly
sarah
presents
her
vain
woman
is
that
a
becoming
phrase
to
the
mother
of
her
husband
i
am
so
provoked
i
think
i
shall
not
answer
him
he
has
no
relish
for
such
arguments
as
i
could
produce
in
support
of
my
own
opinions
and
my
writing
to
him
would
only
bring
on
disagreeable
altercations
my
mother
is
in
a
downright
passion
with
him
selfish
wretch
she
called
him
and
said
he
would
sacrifice
both
honour
and
justice
to
his
own
pride
miss
burchell
poor
soul
how
i
pity
her
her
anxiety
increases
every
hour
she
you
may
be
sure
keeps
a
on
all
mr
motions
for
she
tells
me
she
hears
he
is
arrived
in
town
i
suppose
i
shall
receive
a
notice
of
some
kind
or
other
from
him
the
unhappy
girl
she
grieves
me
to
see
her
there
was
never
so
extravagant
a
love
as
her
she
has
nourished
it
in
solitude
and
i
believe
has
a
heart
naturally
tender
to
an
uncommon
degree
otherwise
she
could
not
for
so
long
a
time
and
with
so
little
hopes
have
preserved
so
undiminished
a
fondness
but
some
accidents
have
i
know
not
how
combined
to
feed
this
flame
she
acknowleges
that
mr
being
disappointed
in
espousing
me
gave
the
first
encouragement
to
her
hopes
for
she
said
she
had
reason
to
believe
that
i
was
the
only
woman
in
the
world
that
stood
between
her
and
her
happiness
and
mr
faulkland
remaining
single
ever
since
confirmed
her
in
that
opinion
then
the
generous
attention
that
he
paid
to
her
welfare
in
recommending
her
to
my
mother
notice
when
he
first
left
england
the
noble
supplies
that
he
constantly
furnished
her
with
ever
since
for
the
child
use
his
behaviour
to
mrs
gerrarde
who
she
says
is
the
most
ensnaring
of
creatures
the
tender
manner
that
he
mentioned
her
in
his
letter
to
my
brother
my
mother
constantly
indulging
her
in
the
belief
that
she
would
one
day
recover
mr
affections
all
these
circumstances
i
say
joined
together
have
kept
alive
the
warmest
and
most
romantic
love
i
ever
saw
or
heard
of
well
may
the
men
say
that
forsaken
women
are
always
the
most
passionate
lovers
it
may
be
so
and
miss
burchell
is
one
instance
of
the
truth
of
this
observation
but
i
think
should
never
make
another
there
is
something
to
me
unaccountable
in
this
but
miss
burchell
is
all
made
up
of
languishments
and
softness
i
have
heard
her
speak
of
mr
faulkland
in
so
rapturous
a
strain
as
has
amazed
me
and
she
once
owned
to
me
that
she
is
sure
she
must
have
died
if
he
had
not
returned
her
love
return
it
ah
my
cecilia
how
did
he
return
it
how
mortifying
is
her
situation
to
be
compelled
to
court
the
man
who
flies
her
and
to
make
use
of
a
rival
mediation
too
but
let
me
forget
that
name
i
am
no
longer
so
to
her
and
shall
do
my
best
to
prove
it
she
wearied
me
with
importunities
to
write
to
mr
faulkland
now
he
is
come
to
town
but
i
beseeched
her
to
have
a
little
patience
till
some
overture
was
first
made
by
him
toward
a
renewal
of
our
acquaintance
which
i
told
her
it
was
very
probable
i
should
soon
receive
you
may
be
sure
i
took
care
not
to
let
her
know
of
the
intimation
i
had
from
sir
george
she
seems
fearful
of
my
seeing
mr
faulkland
oh
madam
said
she
if
he
beholds
your
face
again
i
am
undone
unless
you
can
first
prevail
with
him
she
stopped
understand
you
dear
miss
burchell
i
give
you
my
word
i
will
not
see
mr
faulkland
unless
i
am
first
convinced
i
can
restore
him
to
you
good
you
are
madam
your
influence
all
potent
as
it
is
can
work
miracles
if
mr
faulkland
is
you
will
never
be
his
perhaps
he
may
return
to
his
love
my
dear
ought
she
to
have
said
so
but
it
is
no
matter
it
is
nothing
to
me
now
who
was
his
first
or
second
love
it
has
happened
to
my
wish
a
billet
from
mr
faulkland
sent
with
compliments
and
to
my
mother
and
me
miss
burchell
who
almost
lives
with
us
was
present
when
i
received
it
her
colour
came
and
went
several
times
while
our
servant
delivered
his
message
i
gave
the
letter
into
her
hand
as
soon
as
i
had
read
it
there
is
nothing
alarming
in
it
madam
said
i
see
yourself
only
a
few
friendly
lines
such
as
i
might
expect
her
hands
shook
while
she
held
the
paper
now
madam
said
she
returning
it
now
you
have
a
charming
opportunity
of
writing
to
him
i
shall
not
fail
said
i
to
make
use
of
it
and
will
let
you
see
what
i
write
these
are
the
contents
of
mr
faulkland
letter
will
you
madam
permit
a
forgotten
though
not
the
least
zealous
of
your
friends
to
enquire
after
your
welfare
forgive
me
if
i
renew
your
grief
when
i
tell
you
that
as
i
must
participate
in
every
thing
that
relates
to
you
i
have
deeply
mourned
with
you
on
the
late
calamity
that
has
befallen
you
when
lady
bidulph
opens
her
doors
to
her
general
acquaintance
if
i
may
presume
to
mingle
in
the
crowd
and
kiss
her
hands
i
shall
esteem
it
as
a
particular
honour
but
will
not
without
her
permission
attempt
it
she
is
too
good
to
refuse
me
this
indulgence
you
madam
i
hope
will
not
forbid
it
to
the
humblest
and
most
devoted
of
your
servants
orlando
faulkland
yes
orlando
i
must
forbid
you
i
know
the
consequences
of
thy
insidious
visits
i
try
you
to
the
quick
you
have
given
me
an
opportunity
of
writing
to
you
i
think
without
any
impropriety
miss
burchell
interest
is
uppermost
in
my
wishes
and
i
will
at
least
try
what
my
influence
on
this
romantic
wayward
heart
can
effect
how
happy
should
i
think
myself
if
mediation
as
she
called
it
would
have
the
desired
success
i
wrote
to
mr
faulkland
last
night
my
mother
approved
of
the
letter
which
i
shewed
her
before
i
sent
it
mr
faulkland
was
abroad
when
it
was
left
at
his
house
but
as
i
received
an
answer
to
it
early
this
morning
i
will
give
you
copies
of
the
two
letters
together
and
first
that
of
mine
to
mr
faulkland
i
thank
you
sir
thank
you
from
my
heart
for
your
friendship
and
beg
you
will
not
think
me
ungrateful
for
having
thus
long
deferred
to
pay
you
my
acknowlegements
for
the
signal
favours
i
have
received
at
your
hands
i
am
sensible
sir
that
it
was
owing
to
your
compassion
your
generosity
and
disinterested
nobleness
of
mind
that
i
was
once
indebted
for
the
greatest
blessing
of
my
life
to
you
i
owe
the
vindicating
of
my
suspected
faith
and
the
being
restored
to
the
affection
of
my
dear
husband
for
this
goodness
i
have
never
ceased
to
bless
and
pray
for
you
and
shall
continue
to
do
so
while
i
live
but
oh
sir
while
you
have
given
so
much
cause
for
gratitude
and
esteem
why
will
you
leave
one
heart
to
sigh
for
your
unkindness
a
heart
that
admires
that
loves
that
adores
you
a
heart
worthy
of
your
acceptance
and
which
has
a
right
to
demand
all
your
tenderness
need
i
name
the
amiable
possessor
of
this
heart
i
need
not
there
is
but
one
woman
in
the
world
who
owns
this
description
for
her
let
me
become
an
advocate
she
has
won
me
to
her
party
indeed
sir
she
and
she
only
deserves
your
love
her
i
am
sure
you
have
ever
possessed
unrivalled
though
her
youth
beauty
and
charming
accomplishments
must
have
made
her
the
object
of
every
wishes
who
saw
her
is
above
four
years
since
you
first
won
her
virgin
affections
what
has
been
her
portion
since
that
fatal
time
tears
solitude
and
unremitting
anguish
how
can
a
mind
like
yours
susceptible
as
it
is
of
pity
for
the
woes
of
others
condemn
a
woman
to
perpetual
sorrow
how
can
that
generosity
which
has
been
so
active
on
other
occasions
droop
and
languish
where
there
is
a
cause
to
call
forth
all
its
exertions
do
mr
faulkland
permit
pity
to
plead
in
your
bosom
for
the
dear
miss
burchell
i
should
urge
paternal
affection
too
but
to
the
voice
of
nature
you
can
not
be
deaf
your
sweet
little
son
calls
upon
you
to
do
him
and
his
mother
justice
the
injured
lady
herself
implores
your
compassion
my
mother
who
equally
admires
and
loves
her
intreats
you
i
whom
you
once
esteemed
conjure
you
the
secret
monitor
in
your
own
soul
must
join
in
our
sollicitations
why
then
why
will
you
shut
your
ears
against
the
united
voice
of
reason
of
conscience
and
of
gratitude
you
can
not
you
will
not
do
it
miss
burchell
merit
and
sufferings
must
be
rewarded
and
i
shall
bless
mr
faulkland
as
the
guardian
of
the
injured
the
patron
of
the
afflicted
the
assertor
of
his
own
as
well
as
of
my
honour
this
is
the
light
and
this
only
in
which
i
shall
rejoice
to
see
him
faulkland
you
do
well
madam
you
do
well
to
anticipate
my
suit
and
with
so
much
cruel
eloquence
to
bid
me
despair
yes
i
see
miss
burchell
has
won
you
to
her
party
but
what
have
i
done
to
merit
such
a
malevolent
fate
that
you
you
of
all
created
beings
should
become
advocate
i
little
thought
mrs
arnold
would
make
such
a
barbarous
use
of
her
power
tell
me
thou
dear
tyrant
how
have
i
deserved
this
would
it
not
have
been
kinder
to
have
said
at
once
faulkland
do
not
hope
i
never
will
be
yours
i
hate
i
despise
you
and
leave
you
to
your
fate
oh
no
you
are
artful
in
your
cruelty
you
would
prevent
even
my
wishes
and
cut
off
my
hopes
in
their
blossom
before
they
dare
to
unfold
themselves
to
you
but
you
have
furnished
me
with
weapons
against
yourself
and
i
will
use
them
with
as
little
mercy
as
you
have
shewn
to
me
if
four
years
are
past
since
i
won
miss
burchell
affections
is
it
not
also
long
that
i
have
loved
you
with
an
ardor
oh
thou
insensible
were
you
not
mine
by
your
own
consent
with
your
mother
approbation
was
not
the
day
the
hour
fixed
that
i
was
to
have
led
you
to
the
altar
miss
burchell
hopes
were
never
raised
to
such
a
pitch
as
mine
when
an
avenging
fiend
snatched
the
promised
blessing
from
my
grasp
think
what
were
then
my
sufferings
i
saw
you
afterwards
in
the
arms
of
another
miss
burchell
never
suffered
torture
had
i
seen
you
i
might
have
been
consoled
if
miss
burchell
loved
me
as
i
have
loved
you
she
would
rejoice
in
the
prospect
of
my
felicity
i
should
have
done
so
in
your
heaven
is
my
witness
had
you
been
happy
i
should
not
have
thought
myself
miserable
though
you
were
lost
to
my
hopes
why
do
you
compel
me
to
urge
an
ungrateful
truth
in
regard
to
miss
burchell
madam
she
has
no
claim
to
my
vows
my
gratitude
my
compassion
she
has
an
ample
right
to
and
she
has
them
more
might
by
this
time
have
been
her
if
i
had
never
seen
mrs
arnold
remember
i
do
not
yet
desire
permission
to
throw
myself
at
your
feet
i
revere
you
too
much
to
make
such
a
request
but
do
not
banish
me
your
presence
i
can
not
always
be
proof
against
such
rigours
indulge
me
at
least
in
the
hope
that
time
may
do
something
in
my
favour
i
will
not
desire
you
to
tell
me
so
but
do
not
forbid
it
lady
bidulph
knows
i
respect
her
but
she
is
still
obdurate
if
relented
would
not
madam
do
so
too
i
am
how
this
man
distresses
me
my
dear
what
a
difficult
task
have
i
undertaken
yet
i
will
go
through
with
it
i
am
fearful
of
letting
miss
burchell
see
his
answer
so
discouraging
as
it
is
for
her
yet
how
can
i
withhold
it
from
her
sight
is
necessary
i
should
conceal
nothing
from
her
on
this
occasion
she
confides
in
me
and
i
must
not
give
her
cause
for
suspicion
has
no
right
to
his
this
he
always
said
it
is
necessary
the
lady
should
be
quite
explicit
with
me
i
doubt
she
has
not
been
altogether
sincere
in
what
she
has
said
to
my
mother
on
this
subject
i
shall
see
her
presently
and
discourse
with
her
more
particularly
on
this
head
than
i
have
ever
yet
done
i
have
had
a
conference
with
miss
burchell
a
long
one
and
in
private
for
i
told
my
mother
i
wished
to
talk
with
her
alone
i
began
with
shewing
her
mr
faulkland
last
letter
it
had
the
effect
i
expected
she
was
exceedingly
shocked
i
laid
my
finger
on
that
paragraph
has
no
right
to
my
it
is
necessary
my
dear
madam
said
i
that
you
should
be
perfectly
open
and
candid
with
me
on
this
head
i
have
entered
the
lists
for
you
and
will
not
give
up
your
cause
but
it
depends
on
you
to
furnish
me
with
every
possible
argument
in
your
favour
if
you
mislead
me
by
wrong
insinuations
instead
of
putting
it
in
my
power
to
serve
you
you
will
only
create
to
yourself
fresh
obstacles
it
is
a
nice
subject
madam
and
what
i
have
ever
been
cautious
of
touching
upon
to
you
but
in
the
present
situation
of
your
affairs
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
to
you
that
you
should
have
no
reserves
to
me
when
mr
faulkland
first
recommended
you
to
my
mother
acquaintance
he
referred
her
to
your
honour
for
an
explanation
of
certain
points
of
so
delicate
a
nature
that
i
am
loath
to
touch
upon
them
but
pardon
me
dear
miss
burchell
you
must
be
open
with
me
mr
faulkland
was
obliged
to
declare
in
his
own
justification
that
he
never
sought
to
gain
your
affections
and
was
so
far
from
endeavouring
to
take
advantage
of
the
kind
sentiments
you
had
for
him
that
he
avoided
all
opportunities
of
improving
them
that
he
was
even
surprized
into
the
fatal
step
which
has
since
made
you
so
unhappy
by
the
artifices
of
that
vile
woman
who
had
the
care
of
you
mr
faulkland
relied
so
intirely
on
your
candour
that
as
i
told
you
before
he
referred
my
mother
to
you
for
a
confirmation
of
the
truth
of
what
he
advanced
imagining
that
your
testimony
would
in
some
measure
extenuate
his
fault
my
mother
i
have
reason
to
believe
has
heard
the
story
from
you
in
a
light
less
favourable
to
mr
faulkland
i
was
married
before
she
received
any
information
on
this
subject
from
you
and
as
any
extenuation
on
mr
faulkland
side
was
then
become
a
matter
of
indifference
to
me
i
enquired
not
into
particulars
but
by
what
i
could
judge
from
my
mother
discourse
then
and
from
hints
which
she
has
many
times
dropped
since
i
am
inclined
to
believe
that
either
mr
faulkland
concealed
some
particulars
or
that
you
from
a
delicacy
very
natural
to
a
young
lady
in
such
circumstances
chose
to
draw
a
veil
over
some
parts
of
your
story
but
dear
madam
all
disguises
must
now
be
thrown
aside
depend
upon
it
your
candour
will
more
effectually
recommend
you
to
mr
faulkland
esteem
than
any
thing
else
and
perhaps
your
justifying
him
to
may
be
no
immaterial
circumstance
in
your
favour
variety
of
passions
discovered
themselves
on
her
face
while
i
spoke
but
shame
was
predominant
she
was
mute
and
hung
down
her
head
i
took
her
by
the
hand
do
not
think
my
dear
i
mean
to
ensnare
you
far
be
such
perfidy
from
my
heart
have
i
not
promised
you
my
assistance
i
declare
by
every
thing
that
is
sacred
you
shall
have
it
to
the
utmost
stretch
of
my
power
but
do
not
let
a
false
bashfulness
stand
between
you
and
sincerity
you
will
stop
up
the
way
to
your
own
happiness
if
you
do
speak
dear
madam
has
mr
faulkland
been
just
in
his
representations
she
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
oh
madam
you
read
my
very
soul
what
disguise
can
i
make
use
of
before
such
penetrating
eyes
as
yours
yes
mr
faulkland
spoke
the
truth
shameful
as
the
confession
is
for
me
i
own
it
mrs
gerrarde
base
woman
betrayed
me
my
own
mad
passion
did
the
rest
mr
faulkland
told
me
a
few
days
after
the
fatal
meeting
that
he
was
the
most
miserable
man
on
earth
for
what
had
happened
he
said
there
was
a
lady
in
the
world
to
whom
he
was
bound
to
offer
his
hand
that
her
brother
was
his
particular
friend
that
his
marriage
was
then
actually
negotiating
and
he
was
pressed
on
that
occasion
to
return
to
london
he
owned
he
had
never
seen
the
lady
but
as
his
honour
was
engaged
to
her
brother
he
could
not
look
upon
himself
as
a
free
man
he
cursed
his
ill
fate
that
he
had
not
had
an
opportunity
of
informing
me
of
this
sooner
which
he
said
might
have
prevented
me
from
casting
away
my
affection
on
a
man
who
could
not
deserve
it
what
could
i
say
madam
there
was
no
room
for
reproaches
or
complaints
i
made
none
i
had
nobody
to
accuse
but
myself
i
had
declared
my
frantic
love
to
mr
faulkland
unasked
i
had
implored
his
in
return
in
one
dreadful
moment
i
fell
a
sacrifice
to
my
own
weakness
the
only
hope
that
now
remained
for
me
was
built
on
that
circumstance
of
mr
faulkland
having
never
seen
his
destined
bride
had
i
known
you
madam
to
have
been
the
person
there
could
have
sprung
but
small
comfort
from
that
consideration
but
ignorant
as
i
was
of
the
lady
merit
i
thought
it
not
impossible
but
that
some
objection
might
have
arisen
either
to
her
person
or
temper
or
the
lady
perhaps
though
that
i
thought
almost
incredible
might
not
approve
of
mr
faulkland
in
either
case
some
glimmerings
of
hope
remained
for
me
mr
faulkland
generous
compassion
for
me
gave
me
room
to
think
he
did
not
hate
me
and
i
was
unwilling
to
lose
the
little
interest
i
thought
i
had
gained
in
his
heart
by
much
less
upbraidings
for
which
he
had
given
me
no
cause
i
therefore
acquiesced
determined
to
wait
for
what
my
fate
was
to
do
with
me
resolving
privately
in
my
own
mind
that
in
case
mr
faulkland
intended
nuptials
should
not
take
place
to
remind
him
of
my
love
i
did
not
confess
to
my
aunt
what
had
been
the
result
of
that
interview
which
she
had
contrived
between
mr
faulkland
and
me
shame
would
not
suffer
me
to
indulge
it
but
it
was
not
long
in
my
power
to
conceal
it
i
believe
indeed
she
suspected
it
before
she
reproached
me
for
the
error
which
she
herself
had
caused
but
i
believe
what
most
nettled
her
was
mr
faulkland
having
escaped
the
snare
for
i
am
sure
she
would
have
been
base
enough
to
have
had
me
retain
him
as
a
lover
though
i
could
not
secure
him
for
a
husband
for
he
was
not
the
first
that
this
bad
woman
would
have
seduced
me
to
favour
for
her
own
private
interest
in
the
midst
of
the
horror
into
which
the
condition
i
found
myself
threw
me
i
heard
that
mr
faulkland
was
on
the
point
of
being
married
p
the
prospect
i
had
before
me
drove
me
to
despair
i
knew
i
could
not
remain
long
in
my
uncle
house
i
knew
not
whither
to
fly
in
my
distraction
i
wrote
to
mr
faulkland
you
madam
saw
the
letter
that
letter
which
deprived
mr
faulkland
of
his
happiness
i
soon
received
an
answer
wherein
mr
faulkland
related
to
me
at
large
the
unfortunate
consequences
that
letter
had
produced
he
lamented
in
the
tenderest
manner
my
unhappy
situation
told
me
he
would
provide
me
a
proper
place
for
my
retreat
and
as
i
was
an
entire
stranger
in
london
having
never
been
there
would
recommend
me
to
the
notice
of
one
of
the
best
of
women
lady
bidulph
from
whom
as
my
unhappy
story
was
known
to
her
i
might
expect
the
utmost
humanity
and
here
madam
with
blushes
let
me
own
it
he
urged
me
not
to
conceal
a
single
circumstance
of
the
truth
from
that
lady
know
said
he
my
dear
miss
burchell
i
am
not
a
seducer
rescue
me
from
that
black
suspicion
and
as
far
as
the
unhappy
case
will
admit
clear
my
honour
to
lady
bidulph
see
what
a
reliance
i
have
on
honour
when
i
trust
the
vindicating
of
my
own
to
you
in
such
delicate
circumstances
he
concluded
his
letter
with
telling
me
frankly
that
though
he
had
been
rejected
by
miss
bidulph
he
loved
her
with
such
an
ardent
passion
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
ever
to
think
of
any
other
woman
and
till
he
had
a
heart
to
bestow
he
should
never
entertain
a
thought
of
marriage
you
know
mr
faulkland
at
this
juncture
went
abroad
and
thus
was
i
circumstanced
when
i
came
to
that
house
which
he
had
provided
for
me
and
so
frank
and
noble
were
his
proceedings
that
i
solemnly
declare
i
was
determined
though
at
the
hazard
of
divulging
my
own
shame
to
have
acquitted
him
to
the
utmost
of
my
power
to
lady
bidulph
and
should
have
rejoiced
could
i
have
been
the
means
of
procuring
him
the
happiness
he
deserved
in
regaining
your
favour
as
i
had
been
though
unknowingly
the
unlucky
cause
of
his
losing
it
but
fortune
had
disposed
of
you
otherwise
before
i
saw
lady
bidulph
this
she
quickly
informed
me
of
and
i
will
own
to
you
madam
that
as
i
found
there
was
now
an
insuperable
bar
to
mr
faulkland
hopes
i
was
mean
enough
not
to
have
the
courage
to
speak
truth
i
saw
it
could
not
avail
him
in
regard
to
his
prospects
with
you
lady
bidulph
eye
awed
me
yet
i
think
she
led
me
into
a
justification
of
myself
so
great
were
her
prejudices
against
mr
faulkland
or
perhaps
having
already
disposed
of
you
in
marriage
in
vindication
of
this
step
she
did
not
wish
to
be
undeceived
yes
again
in
spite
of
my
confusion
i
must
repeat
it
i
was
not
sincere
i
threw
out
such
hints
to
lady
bidulph
as
must
have
made
her
think
mr
faulkland
had
taken
pains
to
undo
me
to
this
act
of
disingenuousness
my
sole
motive
was
that
i
might
appear
in
a
less
culpable
light
in
the
eyes
of
a
lady
of
such
strict
virtue
as
your
mother
by
making
her
my
friend
i
was
in
hopes
one
day
of
making
you
so
too
devoted
as
mr
faulkland
was
to
the
most
charming
woman
in
the
world
i
was
not
afraid
of
his
making
a
second
choice
i
thought
if
he
to
be
induced
to
marry
he
might
in
time
be
prevailed
upon
to
turn
his
thoughts
towards
me
in
this
hope
i
have
dragged
on
so
many
tedious
years
i
was
not
mistaken
in
my
opinion
that
he
could
find
none
worthy
to
succeed
mrs
arnold
in
his
heart
he
loves
you
still
madam
but
you
have
declared
you
will
never
be
his
he
is
still
free
these
are
the
circumstances
that
nourish
my
hope
my
heart
is
in
your
hand
i
have
made
you
mistress
of
my
dearest
secret
can
you
forgive
me
madam
but
you
have
an
heroic
soul
remember
mrs
arnold
to
your
generosity
i
now
trust
what
is
dearer
to
me
than
life
should
mr
faulkland
know
should
lady
bidulph
know
how
i
have
abused
their
confidence
i
think
i
could
not
outlive
it
they
never
shall
madam
said
i
i
thank
you
for
this
frank
acknowlegement
of
your
heart
such
a
proof
of
your
confidence
in
me
i
should
be
a
wretch
to
abuse
and
i
hope
to
make
such
a
use
of
the
candid
confession
you
have
now
made
me
as
will
greatly
promote
your
interest
and
is
it
possible
madam
said
she
you
can
yield
up
the
interest
you
have
in
mr
faulkland
without
a
pang
oh
the
exquisite
charmer
and
she
said
it
with
such
an
emphasis
drawing
out
her
breath
in
long
sighs
but
you
are
heroic
as
i
said
before
nature
did
not
mold
your
heart
as
she
has
done
those
of
the
rest
of
your
sex
who
that
was
beloved
by
mr
faulkland
would
yield
him
to
another
worlds
ten
thousand
worlds
would
i
give
to
be
beloved
by
him
as
you
are
but
you
are
a
prodigy
of
a
woman
i
stopped
miss
burchell
in
her
transports
there
is
less
merit
madam
than
you
ascribe
to
me
in
my
conduct
i
readily
acquiesced
under
my
mother
rejection
of
mr
faulkland
when
he
some
interest
in
my
heart
but
there
is
no
in
what
i
am
now
about
to
do
for
you
my
affections
have
long
since
changed
their
object
and
now
lie
buried
with
him
in
his
grave
my
tears
here
bore
witness
to
the
truth
of
what
i
said
miss
burchell
wept
too
her
mind
was
agitated
the
confession
she
had
made
to
me
had
humbled
her
her
heart
overflowed
with
fondness
i
had
filled
her
with
pleasing
hopes
all
these
sensations
combined
together
melting
her
into
tenderness
she
is
made
up
of
tears
and
sighs
and
romantic
wishes
i
can
now
said
i
assure
mr
faulkland
that
you
have
done
him
justice
and
that
he
is
highly
obliged
to
your
candour
she
interrupted
me
but
madam
if
he
should
know
how
my
acknowlegements
came
he
need
not
know
it
said
i
my
mother
shall
not
know
it
either
leave
every
thing
to
my
management
and
depend
upon
my
word
she
snatched
my
hand
eagerly
and
kissed
it
but
oh
madam
above
all
things
said
she
let
not
sir
george
bidulph
know
any
thing
of
your
intended
goodness
in
mediating
for
me
he
hates
me
implacably
he
hates
me
i
upbraid
him
not
for
it
his
strong
attachment
to
mr
faulkland
is
the
cause
of
it
he
accuses
me
in
his
heart
of
being
the
occasion
which
i
own
i
was
though
ignorantly
of
mr
faulkland
disappointment
i
am
sure
were
he
to
know
what
you
design
in
my
favour
he
would
counterwork
you
and
use
all
his
influence
over
his
friend
to
ruin
me
i
made
her
easy
on
this
head
by
assuring
her
sir
george
should
know
nothing
of
the
matter
and
put
her
in
mind
how
lucky
it
was
for
her
that
he
was
absent
i
can
not
help
thinking
my
cecilia
that
there
is
a
sort
of
fatality
has
attended
mr
faulkland
attachment
to
me
by
what
a
strange
accident
did
we
come
to
the
knowledge
of
miss
burchell
affair
how
strong
were
my
mother
prepossessions
against
mr
faulkland
and
how
many
little
circumstances
concurred
her
to
encourage
in
this
disposition
his
letter
from
bath
to
my
brother
helped
to
confirm
her
in
her
dislike
of
his
conduct
miss
burchell
letter
to
mr
faulkland
though
meant
very
differently
was
a
strong
motive
of
condemnation
the
only
means
of
justification
left
for
him
my
mother
did
not
apply
to
till
it
was
too
late
and
then
that
very
circumstances
of
it
too
late
to
serve
him
miss
burchell
acknowleges
was
the
reason
that
the
very
method
which
he
had
proposed
for
his
defence
was
turned
to
his
condemnation
rooted
as
my
mother
prejudices
were
she
engages
herself
she
engages
me
in
a
promise
to
use
my
endeavours
to
promote
miss
marriage
with
mr
faulkland
does
this
not
look
as
if
some
unseen
power
who
guides
our
actions
had
set
a
stamp
of
disapprobation
on
the
union
between
this
man
and
me
i
wish
i
had
seen
that
letter
which
mr
faulkland
wrote
to
my
brother
from
bath
my
mother
said
she
did
not
read
it
through
he
treated
the
subject
lightly
and
there
was
one
circumstance
in
particular
in
it
that
shocked
her
and
yet
surely
if
the
might
not
have
borne
a
favourable
construction
sir
george
would
not
have
shewn
her
that
account
by
way
of
justifying
his
friend
this
reflection
comes
too
late
why
did
it
not
occur
sooner
to
my
mother
or
to
me
we
drew
no
other
inference
from
sir
george
disclosing
this
letter
than
that
as
mr
faulkland
treated
the
affair
ludicrously
it
was
therefore
expected
both
by
him
and
my
brother
that
we
should
consider
it
so
too
that
could
not
have
been
the
case
miss
burchell
confession
has
opened
my
poor
mr
faulkland
what
wayward
fate
is
thine
but
let
me
beware
of
relenting
that
might
be
fatal
there
is
still
one
indelible
blot
remains
upon
his
conduct
miss
burchell
blameable
as
she
acknowleges
herself
was
still
betrayed
and
though
not
by
mr
faulkland
yet
sure
his
having
paid
the
price
of
her
innocence
to
the
wicked
aunt
renders
him
so
far
guilty
as
that
he
owes
her
a
great
reparation
this
was
a
particular
i
durst
not
touch
upon
the
unhappy
girl
herself
being
ignorant
of
it
there
is
a
wide
gulph
fixed
between
mr
faulkland
and
me
how
many
things
are
leagued
against
him
alas
he
thinks
the
principal
bar
to
his
hopes
is
removed
and
that
if
miss
burchell
has
been
just
he
ought
to
be
forgiven
but
he
little
knows
thy
sidney
heart
critically
delicate
as
my
situation
is
in
regard
him
i
am
removed
a
thousand
times
farther
than
ever
from
his
wishes
neither
knows
he
the
engagements
i
am
under
to
miss
burchell
which
alone
would
put
an
bar
between
us
unhappy
miss
burchell
she
has
bound
me
to
her
by
stronger
ties
than
ever
she
has
been
ingenuous
she
has
owned
her
weakness
to
me
she
declares
she
would
have
done
this
sooner
if
it
could
have
promoted
my
happiness
perhaps
she
would
shall
i
not
then
endeavour
to
promote
her
i
will
i
must
my
word
is
given
yet
faulkland
deserves
oh
he
deserves
a
worthier
lot
volume
iii
i
now
send
you
my
cecilia
my
second
letter
to
mr
faulkland
do
you
compel
me
sir
noble
and
disinterested
as
your
conduct
has
been
towards
me
to
accuse
you
now
of
unkindness
you
call
me
insensible
oh
it
is
from
my
too
great
sensibility
that
all
my
sorrows
have
sprung
destitute
as
i
am
of
happiness
myself
or
even
of
a
possibility
of
ever
attaining
it
here
i
look
for
no
other
comfort
in
this
life
but
what
must
arise
from
seeing
those
whom
i
most
esteem
in
possession
of
that
tranquillity
of
mind
which
i
can
never
hope
to
enjoy
if
mr
faulkland
were
happy
if
miss
burchell
were
happy
i
should
be
less
miserable
remember
sir
it
was
not
this
lady
fault
that
you
were
disappointed
in
your
former
hope
she
did
not
try
by
female
wiles
to
engage
a
heart
which
you
refused
her
she
used
no
ungenerous
arts
to
cross
your
wishes
loving
you
as
she
did
almost
to
distraction
she
yielded
you
up
in
silent
anguish
to
a
rival
a
rival
superior
to
herself
in
nothing
i
acknowlege
sir
i
was
to
have
been
yours
and
with
my
own
consent
but
was
it
not
also
with
my
own
consent
those
bonds
were
cancelled
by
which
we
were
to
have
been
united
i
was
then
convinced
miss
burchell
had
a
prior
claim
i
think
so
still
and
ever
shall
miss
burchell
family
is
not
mean
her
fortune
is
considerable
her
beauty
and
personal
accomplishments
inferior
to
none
and
but
for
mr
faulkland
she
had
been
innocent
yet
do
not
imagine
i
would
aggravate
your
fault
miss
burchell
candor
could
not
suffer
this
how
charmingly
ingenuous
was
her
confession
in
the
midst
of
tears
and
blushes
she
owned
her
weakness
you
she
said
were
not
to
blame
she
praised
your
generosity
your
compassion
the
integrity
and
frankness
of
your
whole
behaviour
towards
her
and
could
miss
burchell
suffrage
have
ensured
to
you
the
completion
of
your
wishes
mr
faulkland
would
have
been
indebted
to
her
for
what
he
once
thought
his
happiness
but
though
her
testimony
could
not
avail
you
in
that
particular
yet
are
your
obligations
to
her
the
same
does
not
then
miss
burchell
love
mr
faulkland
with
a
generosity
equal
to
his
own
do
years
of
fervent
and
unalterable
affection
deserve
no
return
does
the
child
the
dear
innocent
that
calls
you
father
deserve
no
consideration
he
bears
your
name
sir
let
him
not
blush
to
own
it
he
may
one
day
be
an
honour
and
a
comfort
to
you
put
it
in
his
power
to
make
it
his
boast
instead
of
his
shame
that
mr
faulkland
was
his
father
the
amiable
lady
whose
very
life
is
bound
up
in
you
has
in
the
midst
of
her
affliction
one
great
source
of
comfort
her
character
has
escaped
the
malignity
of
cruel
tongues
by
the
privacy
with
which
she
conducted
her
measures
till
after
the
birth
of
your
son
the
retirement
she
has
since
lived
in
her
prudent
her
modest
her
exemplary
conduct
have
created
esteem
in
every
body
that
knows
her
this
circumstance
as
it
is
a
peculiar
felicity
to
herself
so
ought
it
to
be
a
motive
of
encouragement
to
you
sir
to
compleat
her
happiness
the
false
judging
part
of
the
world
will
have
nothing
to
point
at
miss
burchell
relation
or
even
connection
with
mrs
gerrarde
is
hardly
known
here
she
has
had
no
correspondence
with
that
irregular
woman
since
she
became
a
widow
and
her
character
had
not
suffered
before
in
such
a
manner
as
to
reflect
dishonour
on
the
young
lady
who
was
then
under
her
care
how
then
can
you
persist
in
a
cruel
rejection
of
this
lady
you
own
she
is
amiable
i
am
sure
she
has
a
thousand
good
qualities
is
her
love
for
you
her
unparalleled
love
to
be
imputed
to
her
as
a
crime
if
it
be
one
long
and
bitter
has
been
her
punishment
on
you
it
rests
to
recompence
her
sufferings
what
may
you
not
expect
from
a
grateful
heart
that
worships
you
such
a
fervent
such
a
faithful
love
deserving
as
you
are
you
perhaps
may
never
again
meet
with
in
woman
with
her
you
may
be
happy
she
will
make
it
the
study
of
her
life
to
render
you
so
your
own
heart
conscious
of
having
acted
nobly
will
confirm
your
happiness
would
to
god
i
could
inspire
you
with
such
sentiments
as
would
induce
you
to
make
the
generous
experiment
how
would
your
character
rise
in
the
esteem
of
the
two
persons
whom
you
profess
to
revere
how
would
you
be
adored
by
the
amiable
sufferer
but
above
all
how
delightful
must
be
the
exultations
of
the
mind
there
wants
but
this
act
to
render
you
the
most
deserving
of
men
i
would
fain
esteem
respect
admire
you
as
i
ought
but
you
will
not
let
me
you
will
be
a
man
and
undistinguished
amongst
the
light
ones
of
your
sex
i
shewed
this
letter
to
miss
burchell
she
read
it
with
grateful
tears
running
down
her
cheeks
in
about
an
hour
i
received
the
following
answer
to
it
burchell
may
triumph
madam
since
she
has
obtained
for
her
advocate
well
have
you
acquitted
yourself
of
the
task
your
rigid
heart
has
undertaken
i
thank
the
lady
for
the
justice
her
charming
ingenuousness
as
you
rightly
call
it
has
done
me
but
what
have
i
gained
by
this
have
i
not
raised
the
fair
complainant
still
higher
in
your
esteem
given
her
a
stronger
claim
to
your
pity
and
furnished
you
with
arms
against
myself
wretch
that
i
am
i
do
i
must
acknowlege
the
force
of
every
thing
that
you
have
urged
miss
burchell
is
amiable
her
sincerity
her
constancy
and
by
me
unmerited
love
deserve
to
be
greatly
recompensed
i
would
to
heaven
i
had
a
heart
to
give
her
but
i
have
not
know
i
have
not
knows
it
too
could
i
have
made
miss
burchell
the
return
she
deserves
i
would
not
thus
long
have
shunned
her
presence
i
acknowleged
the
state
of
my
heart
to
her
even
at
the
time
i
had
lost
all
hopes
of
possessing
you
and
in
the
spite
of
my
own
struggles
after
years
of
confirmed
despair
i
found
myself
still
enslaved
how
then
could
i
offer
a
hand
devoted
as
my
whole
soul
was
to
another
object
to
a
lady
whose
constant
tender
and
delicate
affection
demanded
all
the
return
that
a
sensible
and
grateful
heart
could
make
this
madam
is
all
the
plea
i
can
urge
in
answer
to
those
arguments
you
offer
to
promote
your
favourite
wish
consult
your
own
delicacy
let
miss
burchell
consult
hers
and
then
perhaps
i
shall
stand
acquitted
of
ingratitude
hoped
madam
that
cleared
as
i
have
been
of
imputation
i
might
have
recovered
some
favour
in
yours
and
lady
thoughts
i
was
flattered
with
this
consolation
small
as
it
was
when
every
other
hope
forsook
me
but
when
an
unexpected
event
again
brought
happiness
within
my
prospect
this
reflection
i
own
became
of
more
importance
and
served
to
strengthen
my
then
revived
hopes
but
you
dash
them
with
an
unrelenting
hand
and
again
build
up
those
barriers
between
us
that
heaven
itself
had
overthrown
what
can
i
say
to
you
inflexible
as
you
are
has
miss
burchell
your
pity
you
may
command
my
life
madam
i
would
lay
it
down
freely
for
you
but
i
can
not
must
not
will
not
give
up
my
love
and
till
you
declare
in
express
terms
that
i
be
miserable
i
will
not
even
give
up
my
hope
orlando
faulkland
see
my
cecilia
the
heart
i
have
to
deal
with
hard
to
be
subdued
and
obstinate
in
all
its
purposes
i
expected
difficulties
but
was
in
hopes
he
would
be
less
determined
in
regard
to
his
perseverance
towards
me
i
think
however
i
have
gained
some
ground
he
acknowleges
miss
burchell
merit
and
seems
obliged
to
her
for
the
part
she
has
acted
towards
him
i
have
been
under
some
difficulties
on
this
occasion
for
as
miss
burchell
was
not
so
candid
in
her
acknowlegements
to
my
mother
as
she
has
been
to
me
i
can
not
let
her
know
the
whole
of
her
confession
for
this
reason
i
only
told
her
the
general
purport
of
what
i
wrote
last
to
mr
faulkland
and
in
reading
his
answer
to
her
i
passed
over
such
passages
as
i
thought
might
induce
her
to
require
an
explanation
i
own
i
am
a
little
hurt
at
miss
burchell
former
perverting
of
facts
on
this
occasion
but
as
i
have
already
said
more
than
once
there
are
great
allowances
to
be
made
for
one
in
her
very
critical
situation
neither
have
i
the
least
right
to
reproach
her
for
it
even
in
my
thoughts
for
had
she
been
ever
so
explicit
at
my
mother
first
interview
with
her
it
could
not
have
availed
me
you
find
my
dear
it
is
necessary
i
should
speak
plainly
to
mr
faulkland
i
shall
write
to
him
again
and
here
you
shall
have
a
copy
of
what
i
say
but
i
must
lead
this
violent
spirit
with
gentleness
and
endeavour
to
convince
his
reason
without
wounding
his
tenderness
mrs
arnold
third
letter
to
mr
faulkland
give
me
pleasure
sir
i
begin
to
descry
hopes
for
your
and
my
amiable
friend
i
know
such
a
heart
as
mr
faulkland
can
not
be
proof
against
sentiments
of
gratitude
and
compassion
it
will
not
be
difficult
to
convert
those
sentiments
into
love
when
the
object
is
so
deserving
try
sir
try
the
experiment
can
not
fail
how
much
to
your
honour
will
so
noble
a
triumph
be
over
an
passion
what
delightful
returns
may
you
not
expect
from
the
obliged
the
grateful
partner
of
your
happiness
do
not
call
me
inflexible
or
rigid
filled
as
i
am
with
gratitude
and
a
sense
of
your
merit
i
should
hate
myself
if
i
did
not
acknowlege
that
you
deserve
more
from
me
than
it
can
ever
be
in
my
power
to
repay
i
must
be
plain
with
you
since
you
require
it
it
is
impossible
i
ever
can
be
yours
sorry
i
am
that
the
necessity
of
circumstances
compels
me
to
make
so
early
a
declaration
from
which
i
thought
my
present
situation
would
have
exempted
me
but
i
forgive
you
sir
for
urging
me
on
this
head
and
draw
a
happy
presage
from
your
resting
your
hopes
in
relation
to
me
on
my
own
determination
you
appeal
to
my
delicacy
whether
you
ought
with
a
heart
estranged
to
offer
your
hand
to
miss
burchell
were
delicacy
alone
to
be
consulted
the
answer
perhaps
might
be
easy
but
there
are
superior
considerations
in
your
case
to
be
taken
in
love
without
doubt
demands
love
in
return
but
where
injured
honour
is
to
be
repaired
where
the
disgrace
of
a
darling
child
is
to
be
prevented
those
nicer
sentiments
of
the
soul
must
and
ought
to
give
way
and
i
will
venture
to
pronounce
that
miss
burchell
would
with
raptures
receive
the
hand
which
would
confer
such
valuable
blessings
on
her
leaving
it
to
time
and
her
own
unremiting
tenderness
and
assiduity
to
get
an
interest
in
the
heart
which
by
such
an
act
proved
its
own
rectitude
on
this
subject
i
from
experience
am
qualified
to
speak
you
know
sir
the
interest
you
once
had
in
me
you
can
not
think
me
so
light
a
creature
as
to
suppose
i
so
soon
after
my
breaking
with
you
bestowed
my
affections
on
another
i
did
not
obedience
to
my
mother
commands
was
the
sole
motive
which
engaged
my
vows
to
mr
arnold
and
i
married
him
with
no
other
sentiments
those
of
esteem
and
gratitude
for
the
great
love
he
bore
me
yet
from
these
seeds
sown
in
my
heart
sprung
a
tender
and
ardent
affection
never
did
wife
love
a
husband
better
than
i
did
mr
arnold
his
kindness
merited
and
win
my
whole
affections
nor
could
a
temporary
alienation
of
heart
disposses
him
of
the
place
he
held
in
his
returning
love
for
which
with
all
thankfulness
i
own
myself
bound
to
you
sir
made
him
still
dearer
to
me
than
ever
and
i
now
profess
myself
wedded
to
his
memory
you
have
a
right
sir
to
expect
that
i
should
explain
myself
at
once
to
you
on
this
subject
for
your
own
sake
and
for
miss
burchell
i
must
not
suffer
you
to
entertain
a
doubt
of
my
resolution
you
compel
me
to
repeat
that
i
think
miss
burchell
deserves
your
love
and
has
a
just
right
to
your
hand
she
throws
herself
upon
your
honour
without
pretending
to
have
any
claim
if
she
i
should
not
condescend
to
solicit
the
man
who
could
refuse
to
do
her
justice
mother
is
firm
in
her
first
resolves
could
you
place
a
crown
on
my
head
her
integrity
would
still
oblige
her
to
reject
it
nor
would
a
crown
tempt
me
to
forfeit
the
duty
which
i
owe
to
her
then
sir
if
that
which
you
mention
a
fatal
event
to
me
has
brought
you
nearer
to
your
wishes
and
here
let
me
add
in
justice
to
my
own
particular
sentiments
that
i
think
mr
faulkland
is
the
last
man
who
ought
to
be
my
choice
even
if
my
heart
were
disposed
to
make
one
reproach
me
not
with
ingratitude
or
caprice
till
i
have
explained
myself
it
is
not
long
sir
blameless
and
unconscious
as
you
were
of
the
injury
and
nobly
as
you
repaired
it
since
you
were
the
cause
of
a
separation
between
me
and
my
husband
i
know
you
will
say
that
our
mutual
innocence
on
this
occasion
and
the
secret
being
known
but
to
a
few
of
our
friends
makes
that
objection
of
little
weight
i
grant
you
with
many
it
might
be
so
all
minds
are
not
equally
susceptible
is
my
unhappiness
to
have
a
too
resenting
heart
my
own
honour
scrupulous
you
might
call
it
would
not
suffer
me
to
let
the
man
succeed
mr
arnold
in
my
love
who
was
the
occasion
of
so
much
uneasiness
to
him
and
the
cause
of
my
being
suspected
in
my
fidelity
would
it
not
be
an
insult
on
his
memory
oh
sir
what
is
the
world
opinion
to
the
approbation
of
our
own
hearts
mine
has
never
yet
reproached
me
and
this
has
been
my
support
in
all
my
trials
thus
much
i
say
for
the
reverence
i
bear
my
dear
mr
arnold
memory
but
i
have
other
reasons
to
offer
in
my
excuse
refinements
you
will
call
them
but
my
heart
feels
their
force
i
am
not
the
same
woman
you
once
loved
afflictions
have
impaired
my
health
and
those
little
advantages
of
person
which
nature
bestowed
on
me
have
not
been
improved
by
time
my
spirits
broken
by
misfortunes
have
left
me
languid
and
insensible
to
joy
peace
is
the
utmost
of
my
wish
and
all
that
i
am
now
capable
of
relishing
the
bride
whom
mr
faulkland
once
sought
was
in
the
bloom
of
youth
admired
and
caressed
by
a
flattering
world
unblemished
in
her
character
her
fortune
equal
to
her
wishes
her
heart
her
virgin
heart
was
then
a
present
with
pride
let
me
say
it
worthy
of
any
man
acceptance
it
was
then
in
her
power
to
bestow
happiness
and
mr
faulkland
would
not
have
been
matched
unequally
but
the
scene
is
changed
what
should
i
now
bring
to
your
arms
a
person
faded
by
grief
a
reputation
though
undeservedly
once
called
in
question
a
little
helpless
family
without
fortune
a
widowed
heart
dead
to
love
and
incapable
of
pleasure
oh
sir
could
i
bear
to
be
your
wife
on
such
conditions
indebted
to
you
as
i
am
past
a
possibility
of
my
ever
making
you
a
return
to
what
a
mighty
sum
would
you
raise
the
obligation
how
poor
would
you
make
me
in
my
own
eyes
humbled
as
i
am
by
adversity
my
soul
has
still
too
much
pride
or
let
me
call
it
delicacy
to
submit
to
this
no
if
there
was
no
miss
burchell
in
the
world
no
parental
sway
to
guide
me
in
my
present
circumstances
i
never
would
be
yours
have
now
before
you
my
final
determination
i
shall
trouble
you
no
more
on
the
subject
if
your
heart
relents
towards
miss
burchell
great
will
be
your
reward
in
her
you
are
sure
of
a
tender
faithful
and
charming
friend
who
will
more
than
repay
every
act
of
kindness
towards
her
and
he
who
is
the
author
of
justice
and
mercy
will
not
fail
to
bless
you
am
c
methinks
my
dear
friend
i
have
now
eased
my
heart
of
a
load
that
oppressed
it
what
can
i
say
more
mr
faulkland
now
knows
my
determined
purpose
in
regard
to
myself
and
if
he
is
not
quite
insensible
i
think
miss
burchell
must
at
last
obtain
the
wish
of
her
soul
oh
my
cecilia
i
would
not
have
my
heart
devoured
by
such
a
flame
as
her
for
the
whole
world
but
have
i
not
acted
as
i
should
do
i
hope
i
have
i
feel
satisfied
with
my
own
conduct
and
i
never
yet
found
that
to
be
the
case
when
i
acted
wrong
there
are
some
nice
points
in
which
our
own
hearts
are
the
best
as
well
as
the
most
impartial
judges
if
mr
faulkland
persists
in
rejecting
poor
miss
burchell
i
can
urge
him
no
farther
but
i
am
determined
not
to
see
him
how
uneasy
has
been
my
suspense
these
three
days
i
question
if
miss
burchell
is
much
greater
no
answer
from
this
strange
man
perhaps
he
is
flown
off
no
i
wrong
him
a
letter
is
this
minute
brought
up
to
me
from
him
read
it
my
beloved
and
congratulate
me
were
born
to
conquer
madam
what
is
there
that
you
can
not
effect
my
heart
was
made
for
you
and
you
can
mould
it
as
you
please
enjoy
your
triumph
if
it
be
one
i
will
receive
miss
burchell
as
gift
and
since
i
can
not
obtain
your
love
i
will
at
least
compel
your
esteem
why
should
generosity
compassion
for
an
unhappy
lady
to
whom
you
have
no
obligation
exceed
that
of
a
man
who
owns
himself
bound
to
her
in
gratitude
i
wish
i
could
repay
her
the
debt
of
love
i
owe
her
but
i
will
try
to
repair
my
fault
hereafter
and
in
her
gentle
bosom
perhaps
i
may
recover
that
peace
to
which
i
have
been
so
long
a
stranger
she
will
forgive
the
waywardness
of
a
heart
which
never
disguised
its
anguish
to
her
and
which
she
knows
has
been
torn
by
a
cruel
passion
that
like
a
cruel
disease
was
not
either
to
be
resisted
or
subdued
but
thanks
to
you
madam
i
think
i
begin
to
feel
my
cure
approaching
miss
tenderness
will
finish
what
you
have
begun
you
shall
never
reproach
me
more
if
i
had
an
interest
in
your
heart
i
will
not
forfeit
it
now
but
make
that
proud
heart
acknowledge
spite
of
itself
that
faulkland
was
not
unworthy
of
it
ha
my
cecilia
what
do
you
say
to
my
orlando
now
orlando
let
me
this
once
call
him
has
he
not
a
noble
mind
happy
happy
miss
burchell
you
are
at
length
arrived
to
the
summit
of
your
wishes
long
may
you
enjoy
them
and
may
you
make
your
love
as
blest
as
he
deserves
to
be
my
mother
clasped
her
hands
together
in
joy
when
i
read
this
letter
to
her
god
bless
him
god
bless
him
said
she
he
is
now
indeed
a
righteous
man
how
rejoiced
i
am
my
dear
that
i
have
been
the
means
of
bringing
about
his
event
and
yet
methinks
if
i
were
in
miss
burchell
place
though
my
heart
doated
on
the
man
to
death
i
could
not
receive
him
on
such
terms
he
accepts
her
as
gift
it
is
to
raise
himself
in
my
esteem
he
does
her
justice
nay
i
think
the
assuming
man
seems
to
insinuate
a
sort
of
superiority
over
me
by
this
concession
why
let
it
be
so
i
shall
be
content
in
my
humiliation
if
gift
will
restore
him
to
his
peace
if
it
does
which
i
pray
heaven
it
may
ought
he
not
to
think
himself
indebted
to
me
i
think
i
should
not
let
miss
burchell
see
this
last
letter
he
does
not
consent
with
a
good
grace
and
it
may
damp
her
joy
though
upon
second
thoughts
i
question
whether
she
has
delicacy
enough
to
be
much
affected
by
this
circumstance
i
am
saved
the
trouble
of
observing
any
decorum
towards
miss
burchell
she
has
been
just
here
wild
with
transport
and
was
several
minutes
in
the
room
before
i
could
get
her
to
speak
coherently
she
had
received
a
letter
from
mr
faulkland
written
by
his
own
angelic
hand
she
said
she
made
no
difficulty
of
leaving
it
with
me
and
here
it
is
mr
faulkland
letter
to
miss
burchell
it
possible
madam
that
i
can
still
be
dear
to
you
careless
and
remiss
as
i
have
been
towards
you
since
you
first
honoured
me
with
your
affection
if
you
can
forgive
this
i
am
ready
to
offer
you
my
hand
and
hope
by
devoting
my
future
days
to
you
to
make
you
amends
for
those
years
during
which
deserving
as
you
are
i
have
withheld
that
heart
which
was
your
due
never
had
any
merit
towards
you
but
my
sincerity
and
i
will
not
now
give
up
that
virtue
to
arrogate
to
myself
another
to
which
i
have
no
title
i
own
to
you
madam
that
it
is
to
mrs
superior
prudence
and
nice
honour
i
am
beholden
for
being
brought
to
a
just
sense
of
your
worth
and
my
own
obligations
to
you
if
you
will
give
me
leave
to
attend
you
this
afternoon
you
will
receive
a
man
filled
with
sentiments
of
gratitude
and
esteem
for
you
and
who
is
determined
by
his
future
conduct
to
deserve
a
continuance
of
your
love
am
i
congratulated
miss
burchell
after
reading
this
letter
on
her
approaching
felicity
she
had
not
words
to
express
her
acknowlegements
to
me
the
service
i
had
rendered
her
was
indeed
to
her
a
most
important
one
and
there
are
some
occasions
where
are
of
no
use
miss
burchell
can
be
eloquent
without
them
she
embraced
me
a
thousand
times
and
wept
in
tender
transport
on
my
neck
my
mother
is
as
much
delighted
at
this
happy
event
as
if
it
immediately
concerned
her
own
welfare
she
recommended
it
to
miss
burchell
to
have
her
little
boy
with
her
when
mr
faulkland
came
to
visit
her
it
seems
he
has
not
seen
the
child
since
his
last
return
to
england
he
did
not
care
to
go
to
the
house
where
it
was
boarded
for
fear
of
drawing
any
observation
on
himself
to
miss
burchell
prejudice
and
the
people
never
permitted
the
child
to
be
taken
abroad
by
any
one
but
miss
burchell
who
passes
for
its
aunt
or
mr
faulkland
but
this
good
woman
happening
to
be
sick
when
he
came
to
town
mr
faulkland
had
not
an
opportunity
of
sending
for
it
miss
burchell
greatly
approved
of
the
motion
and
flew
from
us
to
prepare
for
this
so
much
desired
interview
and
now
cecilia
do
you
not
think
mr
faulkland
has
proved
himself
a
disinterested
lover
shall
i
say
of
your
sidney
indeed
he
has
given
a
noble
testimony
of
his
esteem
and
deference
for
me
as
well
as
he
formerly
did
of
his
affection
if
miss
burchell
does
not
render
herself
worthy
of
him
how
shall
i
hate
myself
for
having
brought
about
this
union
but
she
loves
him
too
ardently
and
is
herself
too
lovely
not
to
get
possession
of
his
heart
when
it
becomes
his
duty
as
well
as
his
interest
to
give
it
up
to
her
all
acquaintance
between
her
and
me
must
now
cease
for
her
sake
as
well
as
mr
faulkland
this
will
be
necessary
my
presence
may
disturb
but
can
never
contribute
to
the
tranquillity
of
either
of
them
miss
burchell
was
in
too
much
haste
to
communicate
her
joy
to
us
to
defer
giving
an
account
of
what
passed
between
her
and
mr
faulkland
yesterday
evening
she
hurried
to
us
last
night
at
almost
ten
he
came
to
her
house
she
said
at
six
the
hour
she
had
appointed
him
and
looked
enchantingly
she
herself
was
dressed
out
very
elegantly
to
receive
him
and
i
thought
looked
really
charming
her
countenance
was
so
lighted
up
with
joy
that
she
did
not
appear
the
same
woman
she
had
endeavoured
she
said
to
compose
herself
for
this
interview
and
had
tried
to
assume
something
of
dignity
but
it
all
vanished
when
her
conqueror
approached
and
the
tumult
of
her
heart
so
intirely
banished
all
recollection
and
presence
of
mind
that
she
was
not
able
to
tell
me
in
what
manner
she
received
him
she
only
knows
she
says
that
having
snatched
up
her
little
boy
who
stood
by
her
and
hung
on
her
gown
she
put
him
into
his
father
arms
and
bidding
the
babe
thank
him
for
his
goodness
she
burst
into
tears
mr
faulkland
tenderly
embraced
the
child
not
without
a
visible
emotion
of
countenance
and
having
gently
set
him
down
again
he
placed
himself
by
miss
burchell
side
she
was
still
sobbing
those
generous
tears
madam
said
he
taking
her
by
the
hand
reproach
me
too
much
i
have
not
deserved
this
tenderness
i
can
not
look
upon
you
nor
that
dear
boy
without
blushing
but
you
have
forgiven
me
it
shall
be
the
study
of
my
life
to
make
you
both
happy
oh
madam
continued
miss
burchell
what
an
exquisite
joy
must
such
a
declaration
give
me
from
the
beloved
of
my
soul
i
wrung
his
hand
oh
sir
you
are
too
good
what
return
can
i
make
you
one
thing
only
say
to
me
that
you
do
not
offer
me
a
reluctant
hand
and
i
shall
then
be
the
happiest
of
women
mr
faulkland
paused
a
little
while
and
then
with
a
noble
frankness
replied
know
my
dear
miss
burchell
with
what
an
excess
of
passion
i
have
ever
loved
mrs
arnold
had
no
such
woman
existed
would
have
been
my
choice
preferably
to
any
other
but
when
i
first
knew
you
i
looked
upon
myself
as
bound
to
her
though
at
that
time
i
had
never
seen
her
my
knowledge
of
her
afterwards
confirmed
me
her
i
made
no
secret
of
this
to
you
and
you
may
remember
what
my
declarations
to
you
were
even
at
the
time
my
hopes
were
frustrated
i
have
loved
her
fervently
ever
since
even
in
the
arms
of
a
husband
i
adored
her
and
i
will
be
candid
enough
to
own
to
you
that
as
my
attachment
to
her
has
during
all
that
time
estranged
me
from
you
so
should
i
still
had
i
the
least
hopes
of
succeeding
have
persisted
in
my
suit
but
she
has
cut
off
all
hope
she
has
declared
she
can
never
be
mine
and
at
the
same
time
has
represented
my
obligations
to
you
in
so
strong
a
light
that
i
am
convinced
i
ought
to
be
your
and
let
me
own
madam
you
who
are
generous
and
know
what
it
is
to
love
will
pardon
a
declaration
which
i
durst
not
make
to
any
other
woman
to
you
i
will
confess
that
mrs
arnold
is
arbitress
of
my
fate
and
in
approving
myself
to
her
i
do
so
to
my
own
conscience
i
do
not
therefore
though
my
actions
have
been
guided
by
her
yield
with
reluctance
to
her
will
her
virtue
her
religion
and
enlarged
mind
have
only
dictated
to
me
what
my
own
reason
tells
me
i
ought
to
do
i
have
been
a
slave
to
a
hopeless
passion
too
long
i
am
now
resolved
to
struggle
with
my
chains
you
madam
must
assist
me
in
breaking
them
entirely
and
i
make
no
doubt
but
that
time
joined
to
my
own
efforts
and
aided
by
your
sweetness
of
disposition
your
tenderness
and
admirable
sense
will
enable
me
to
conquer
what
i
must
now
call
a
weakness
and
make
the
triumph
equally
happy
for
us
both
but
remember
madam
i
never
see
mrs
arnold
more
is
for
your
peace
sake
as
well
as
my
own
that
i
make
this
a
preliminary
to
our
marriage
i
will
when
you
shall
vouchsafe
me
the
honour
of
your
hand
receive
it
if
you
please
from
lady
bidulph
and
as
i
presume
it
will
be
agreeable
to
you
to
have
the
ceremony
intirely
private
that
i
may
for
our
dear
little
boy
sake
present
you
rather
as
my
acknowleged
wife
than
as
my
new
made
bride
i
will
with
the
utmost
speed
and
secrecy
have
such
dispositions
made
as
shall
be
suitable
to
my
condition
and
your
own
merit
should
like
after
we
are
united
if
you
have
no
objection
to
it
to
pay
a
visit
for
a
while
to
an
estate
i
have
in
ireland
which
i
have
never
yet
seen
and
which
i
intended
to
have
looked
at
if
this
event
this
happy
event
and
he
kissed
my
hand
had
not
taken
place
penetrated
as
i
was
pursued
miss
burchell
with
a
sense
of
the
generosity
and
openness
of
his
heart
i
could
not
forbear
raising
his
hand
to
my
lips
he
tenderly
withdrew
it
from
me
as
if
abashed
at
my
condescension
he
then
turned
the
discourse
to
less
interesting
subjects
and
after
three
delightful
hours
spent
with
me
took
his
leave
not
without
having
first
fixed
on
wednesday
next
wednesday
to
be
the
blessed
day
that
is
to
make
him
mine
for
ever
happy
happy
may
you
be
said
i
you
be
happy
but
let
me
see
you
once
again
before
you
are
mrs
faulkland
there
are
not
many
hours
to
come
before
that
name
will
be
yours
my
dear
madam
said
she
and
patted
my
bosom
with
her
hand
i
hope
all
is
well
she
looked
earnestly
in
my
face
and
then
added
but
you
have
a
noble
heart
is
an
honest
one
i
hope
said
i
a
little
disconcerted
at
her
manner
why
did
she
address
me
thus
my
dear
i
hope
i
did
not
discover
any
thing
in
my
behaviour
as
if
i
repined
her
good
fortune
if
i
did
far
be
such
a
wretched
meanness
from
the
heart
of
thy
friend
was
it
not
my
own
act
to
make
miss
burchell
the
happy
woman
she
now
thinks
herself
yet
i
own
there
is
something
in
mr
faulkland
conduct
which
has
raised
my
esteem
to
admiration
oh
may
his
future
days
be
blessed
else
shall
i
indeed
be
wretched
my
mother
told
miss
burchell
it
would
give
her
inexpressive
satisfaction
to
bestow
her
in
marriage
on
mr
faulkland
and
desired
she
would
let
her
know
at
what
time
and
place
the
ceremony
as
to
be
performed
she
answered
at
her
own
house
as
she
could
be
no
where
else
so
private
and
that
mr
faulkland
would
engage
for
the
purpose
a
clergyman
a
particular
friend
of
his
and
on
whose
discretion
he
could
rely
miss
burchell
spirits
were
too
much
exhilarated
to
let
her
think
of
rest
she
staid
with
us
till
it
was
very
late
and
having
taken
occasion
to
mention
how
grieved
she
was
at
the
thoughts
of
losing
my
society
and
of
the
necessity
mr
faulkland
expressed
himself
under
of
never
seeing
me
more
my
mother
took
that
opportunity
of
gravely
entering
into
the
subject
of
matrimonial
duties
she
highly
applauded
mr
resolution
on
that
head
and
told
miss
burchell
it
ought
exceedingly
to
enhance
his
merit
towards
her
let
this
be
a
memorandum
to
you
my
dear
madam
said
she
how
sacred
the
bond
is
to
be
held
that
is
now
going
to
unite
you
he
will
not
you
see
run
the
hazard
of
being
tempted
even
in
thought
to
swerve
from
that
faith
which
he
is
going
to
plight
to
you
your
situation
is
delicate
and
it
will
require
the
utmost
prudence
and
circumspection
on
your
part
to
secure
such
an
interest
in
his
heart
as
he
now
seems
inclined
to
give
you
it
is
not
on
your
personal
charms
that
you
are
to
rely
for
subduing
or
preserving
the
affections
of
such
a
man
as
he
is
they
alone
you
see
were
not
able
to
effect
this
it
is
to
mr
faulkland
honour
rather
than
his
love
that
you
are
now
obliged
for
the
justice
he
has
done
you
never
let
this
be
out
of
your
thoughts
be
grateful
but
let
your
gratitude
have
dignity
in
it
and
by
your
behaviour
convince
your
husband
that
honour
was
with
you
a
first
motive
to
wish
this
union
love
will
then
come
in
with
a
better
grace
as
a
secondary
inducement
the
freedom
of
my
mother
observations
and
instructions
i
was
not
surprized
at
because
she
always
speaks
her
mind
but
the
emphasis
with
which
she
delivered
herself
was
unusual
miss
burchell
expressed
herself
as
obliged
to
her
and
joined
intirely
in
her
opinion
i
could
perceive
however
she
was
not
pleased
with
the
lecture
when
miss
burchell
was
gone
my
mother
told
me
she
thought
it
necessary
to
speak
as
she
had
done
miss
burchell
said
she
is
not
the
girl
i
took
her
for
so
much
modesty
and
reserve
i
thought
i
had
never
met
with
in
a
young
creature
before
when
she
used
to
speak
of
mr
faulkland
it
was
with
affection
indeed
but
with
such
a
nice
decorum
as
convinced
me
of
the
innocence
and
purity
of
her
heart
but
of
late
i
have
observed
she
has
been
less
delicate
in
her
expressions
of
tenderness
such
passionate
flights
have
sometimes
broke
from
her
as
i
did
not
think
becoming
in
a
young
woman
and
which
indeed
almost
offended
me
and
this
night
her
joy
has
been
ungoverned
great
reason
she
has
for
joy
is
true
but
there
are
some
considerations
which
ought
to
have
made
her
chasten
that
joy
into
a
sober
and
at
least
seemingly
moderate
satisfaction
she
loves
mr
faulkland
but
let
her
beware
of
disgusting
a
man
of
his
sense
by
too
strong
an
expression
of
her
fondness
my
mother
observation
and
her
uncommonly
forcible
manner
of
expressing
it
struck
me
prodigiously
it
is
true
i
had
made
the
same
remarks
myself
but
as
you
know
she
is
not
extremely
penetrating
and
in
general
but
a
superficial
observer
i
was
the
more
surprized
at
what
she
said
miss
burchell
behaviour
must
have
been
formerly
very
different
from
what
it
now
is
to
have
made
my
mother
so
sensible
of
the
change
she
said
ought
to
have
made
her
chasten
her
joy
perhaps
she
meant
no
more
than
that
the
young
lady
even
in
the
midst
of
that
joy
had
upon
reflection
cause
for
humiliation
i
hope
she
did
not
think
that
her
gaiety
on
this
desired
event
affected
me
who
had
so
warmly
promoted
it
my
mother
is
too
open
not
to
give
the
full
meaning
of
her
thoughts
this
may
be
only
the
suggestion
of
my
own
fancy
yet
it
has
mortified
me
i
had
but
little
rest
last
night
and
rose
this
morning
by
to
throw
together
in
writing
the
above
particulars
miss
burchell
came
not
to
us
till
late
this
evening
pleasure
danced
in
her
eyes
i
whispered
to
her
we
rejoice
with
you
dear
madam
sincerely
rejoice
at
your
approaching
felicity
but
our
present
state
will
not
suffer
us
to
keep
pace
with
you
in
that
gaiety
however
justifiable
it
may
be
from
the
cause
restrain
yourself
a
little
my
mother
will
not
think
you
kind
as
we
are
so
soon
to
part
with
you
she
smiled
and
thanking
me
for
the
hint
immediately
composed
her
features
to
such
a
decorum
i
will
not
call
it
demureness
that
it
was
impossible
to
discover
she
was
agitated
by
any
extraordinary
emotion
i
own
i
was
amazed
at
the
command
she
so
suddenly
assumed
over
her
countenance
i
was
glad
however
she
did
so
that
my
mother
might
not
have
fresh
cause
of
dislike
towards
her
she
told
us
that
mr
faulkland
had
settled
a
thousand
pounds
a
year
on
her
and
that
too
without
ever
having
informed
himself
of
the
state
of
her
fortune
for
in
the
hurry
of
her
thoughts
she
had
neglected
to
mention
it
to
him
generous
man
whispered
i
to
myself
she
then
with
great
gravity
applied
herself
to
my
mother
and
told
her
she
hoped
for
the
honour
of
her
presence
the
next
morning
at
her
own
house
where
the
ceremony
was
to
be
performed
before
no
other
witnesses
but
her
ladyship
and
the
gentlewoman
who
had
been
mr
faulkland
housekeeper
and
that
the
following
day
they
purposed
retiring
to
mr
faulkland
seat
in
hertfordshire
and
after
a
short
stay
there
to
set
out
for
ireland
my
mother
commended
mr
faulkland
diligence
for
having
so
suddenly
disposed
every
thing
for
this
important
event
and
told
our
friend
she
would
not
fail
to
attend
her
at
the
appointed
time
miss
burchell
behaviour
was
extremely
composed
she
either
really
was
or
affected
to
be
extremely
sorry
at
parting
with
me
she
could
not
stay
long
with
us
she
said
as
she
had
many
things
to
settle
in
the
remaining
part
of
that
evening
on
taking
leave
of
me
i
shall
not
see
you
again
worthiest
of
women
said
she
at
least
for
many
months
but
my
love
my
respect
and
my
gratitude
towards
you
will
be
as
lasting
as
my
life
you
shall
hear
often
from
me
and
be
so
good
as
sometimes
to
tell
me
i
am
not
forgotten
she
embraced
me
with
tears
in
her
eyes
but
i
thought
she
tripped
down
stairs
to
her
chair
as
if
her
heart
was
very
light
my
mother
liked
her
deportment
she
said
she
believed
the
flightiness
of
her
behaviour
before
was
owing
to
her
being
quite
intoxicated
with
the
suddenness
of
her
joy
on
so
unexpected
a
turn
of
fortune
but
that
since
she
had
time
for
recollection
she
had
recovered
her
wonted
bashful
and
sober
air
with
which
she
used
to
be
so
delighted
my
mother
says
she
will
contrive
to
carry
a
rich
white
brocade
gown
with
her
in
order
to
slip
it
on
at
miss
house
for
she
would
not
on
any
consideration
appear
in
mourning
on
this
joyful
occasion
you
know
the
reverence
she
has
for
omens
the
important
event
is
over
my
cecilia
miss
burchell
is
now
mrs
faulkland
my
mother
is
just
returned
and
saw
the
nuptial
knot
tied
the
lady
she
said
looked
very
lovely
and
it
was
easy
to
observe
she
gave
her
hand
with
all
her
heart
mr
faulkland
behaviour
was
polite
and
unconstrained
but
his
attention
to
his
bride
was
more
gallant
than
tender
and
his
whole
deportment
was
that
of
a
man
who
seemed
to
endeavour
at
acquitting
himself
with
a
good
grace
of
an
act
of
duty
rather
than
of
inclination
the
latter
part
of
the
observation
is
mine
not
my
mother
but
i
collected
it
from
certain
little
particulars
which
she
related
to
me
in
her
own
way
without
drawing
any
inference
from
them
he
thanked
her
in
a
most
respectful
manner
for
the
honour
she
had
done
him
and
for
her
former
friendship
to
miss
burchell
but
did
not
once
mention
my
name
so
much
the
better
i
hope
he
will
forget
me
my
mother
is
mighty
alert
on
the
occasion
and
felicitates
both
herself
and
me
on
our
having
brought
about
this
very
important
affair
she
joined
heartily
with
me
in
praying
that
the
pair
may
be
happy
in
each
other
she
is
quite
reconciled
to
mr
faulkland
what
a
pity
it
was
said
she
and
stopped
then
added
but
every
thing
is
for
the
best
i
understood
her
but
made
no
reply
they
go
out
of
town
morning
all
happiness
attend
them
i
expect
sir
george
will
be
quite
outrageous
about
this
marriage
my
second
refusal
of
his
friend
with
the
addition
of
his
now
being
wedded
through
my
persuasion
to
a
woman
my
brother
never
could
endure
will
i
fear
exasperate
him
beyond
a
possibility
of
reconciliation
i
can
not
help
it
i
have
acted
agreeably
to
the
dictates
of
my
duty
that
must
be
my
consolation
life
is
in
itself
a
warfare
life
has
been
particularly
so
my
mother
is
far
from
being
well
her
spirits
have
been
a
little
heightened
for
these
few
days
past
but
her
disorder
i
see
gains
ground
the
swelling
in
her
legs
is
returning
and
her
rest
at
night
quite
broken
i
am
hourly
habituating
myself
to
think
of
her
dissolution
or
in
other
words
am
preparing
myself
for
the
worst
evil
that
can
now
befal
me
i
hope
i
shall
find
myself
equal
to
the
trial
here
is
a
storm
for
you
my
dear
a
letter
from
sir
george
i
wanted
such
a
thing
to
rouse
me
from
the
almost
lethargic
dulness
that
was
creeping
on
me
mr
faulkland
has
acquainted
him
with
his
marriage
pray
observe
his
brotherly
address
mrs
arnold
i
disclaim
all
relation
to
you
i
have
just
now
had
a
letter
from
faulkland
wherein
i
am
at
once
informed
of
your
having
finally
rejected
him
and
of
his
being
married
to
miss
burchell
as
for
the
first
your
own
folly
be
on
your
head
you
will
have
time
enough
for
repentance
and
i
need
wish
you
no
other
punishment
than
what
and
for
me
be
the
consequences
of
your
obstinate
adherence
to
your
own
romantic
wild
opinions
but
what
in
the
name
of
blind
infatuation
could
provoke
you
to
urge
the
man
to
whom
you
owed
such
obligations
to
his
destruction
i
know
have
done
it
he
could
not
be
so
mad
but
under
influence
you
and
my
mother
i
suppose
fancy
you
have
done
a
righteous
deed
but
you
have
done
what
i
am
afraid
poor
faulkland
will
have
reason
to
i
will
suppress
the
shocking
word
that
my
indignation
suggested
was
i
not
made
acquainted
with
this
precious
design
of
marrying
my
friend
to
that
insinuating
little
viper
i
might
perhaps
have
prevented
the
mischief
for
i
can
not
think
if
she
had
not
imposed
upon
you
that
you
would
have
pushed
your
chimerical
notions
of
honour
to
such
extremities
you
meant
well
but
it
has
ever
been
your
peculiar
misfortune
i
think
to
have
your
good
intentions
productive
of
nothing
but
evil
this
last
action
i
fear
will
be
a
severe
proof
of
the
truth
of
this
observation
i
warned
you
in
time
against
this
woman
but
my
advice
has
always
been
despised
will
say
no
more
on
the
hateful
subject
what
is
done
is
irrevocable
but
i
believe
you
will
hardly
be
able
to
answer
it
to
yourself
if
you
find
that
you
have
condemned
one
of
the
noblest
fellows
in
the
world
to
the
arms
of
a
prostitute
lord
bless
me
my
cecilia
was
there
ever
such
a
barbarian
with
what
an
implacable
aversion
does
he
pursue
this
poor
girl
but
what
does
he
mean
by
the
odious
epithet
with
which
he
closes
his
horrid
letter
sure
miss
burchell
merits
not
that
name
her
weakness
in
regard
to
mr
faulkland
can
not
bring
on
her
so
detestable
a
charge
if
george
knows
any
thing
more
of
her
character
than
i
do
why
did
he
not
tell
me
so
before
it
can
not
be
his
aversion
to
her
makes
him
cruel
and
unjust
he
says
true
i
should
not
indeed
forgive
myself
if
i
were
the
means
of
making
mr
faulkland
unhappy
and
his
observation
would
be
dreadfully
verified
that
all
my
good
intentions
produce
nothing
but
evil
if
this
marriage
should
prove
to
be
unfortunate
i
have
had
a
letter
from
mrs
faulkland
she
and
her
husband
are
arrived
safely
at
his
estate
on
the
borders
of
the
north
of
ireland
within
less
than
thirty
miles
of
the
capital
it
is
a
pleasant
part
of
the
country
she
says
but
as
mr
faulkland
has
no
house
there
they
have
taken
up
their
lodgings
for
the
present
at
the
house
of
his
steward
her
letter
is
filled
with
declarations
of
the
felicity
she
enjoys
she
says
she
would
not
change
her
lot
to
be
the
greatest
queen
on
may
she
continue
to
deserve
her
happy
fortune
and
to
render
her
husband
as
satisfied
with
lot
as
she
is
with
then
shall
i
triumph
over
sir
george
for
his
vile
insinuations
i
have
heard
from
my
good
lady
v
in
answer
to
the
letter
i
wrote
her
giving
an
account
of
mr
faulkland
marriage
as
he
had
not
made
her
acquainted
with
his
return
to
england
i
knew
not
whether
he
had
informed
her
of
this
particular
and
i
find
he
had
not
as
lady
v
was
a
stranger
to
his
former
connection
with
miss
burchell
with
whom
i
have
already
told
you
she
was
acquainted
and
that
she
entertained
a
very
favourable
opinion
of
her
she
expressed
no
displeasure
at
the
alliance
but
said
she
supposed
he
married
in
a
tifft
upon
my
refusal
of
him
for
which
i
gave
her
such
reasons
as
i
had
before
given
mr
faulkland
excepting
those
which
related
to
miss
burchell
which
for
both
their
sakes
must
now
be
no
more
mentioned
lady
v
says
she
not
condemn
the
delicacy
of
my
sentiments
though
she
owns
her
wish
was
that
it
could
have
been
got
over
as
she
is
sure
that
mr
faulkland
can
never
be
happy
with
any
one
but
here
follows
an
interval
of
near
two
months
in
which
nothing
material
occurred
the
time
approaches
my
cecilia
when
thy
friend
shall
be
poor
and
destitute
i
know
thy
generous
heart
will
more
than
sympathize
with
me
in
my
calamity
from
the
aggravating
reflexion
that
it
is
not
in
your
power
to
assist
me
the
account
you
have
given
me
of
your
husband
close
disposition
has
too
fully
convinced
me
of
this
nor
should
i
have
mentioned
my
apprehensions
to
you
at
this
time
but
that
i
am
bound
not
to
conceal
a
thought
from
the
friend
of
my
heart
sir
george
has
dropt
all
correspondence
with
us
i
have
nothing
to
expect
from
him
nor
does
that
mortal
live
yourself
excepted
to
whom
i
would
on
such
an
occasion
be
indebted
i
have
already
sighed
too
often
under
the
weight
of
obligations
which
i
could
not
repay
my
mother
is
hastening
apace
to
a
better
world
she
sees
her
end
approaching
with
such
a
calmness
such
a
truly
pious
joy
as
almost
makes
me
ashamed
of
lamenting
her
loss
for
what
is
it
in
me
my
dear
but
selfishness
is
true
the
loss
of
a
tender
parent
a
faithful
friend
at
a
time
when
all
other
comforts
of
life
are
fled
is
an
evil
one
would
wish
wholly
to
avoid
or
at
least
to
postpone
for
the
longest
date
possible
but
when
i
consider
welfare
ought
i
to
indulge
myself
in
such
a
wish
her
life
is
already
become
a
burden
to
her
her
infirmities
are
painful
and
without
hope
of
cure
she
longs
to
be
released
and
to
receive
that
reward
of
her
righteousness
which
can
not
be
obtained
on
this
side
of
the
grave
if
we
had
a
friend
who
in
compassion
to
our
wants
or
weakness
consented
to
live
with
us
though
under
the
pressure
of
years
and
bodily
pain
and
that
friend
were
invited
to
a
remote
country
with
an
assurance
of
recovering
health
of
having
youth
renewed
and
of
possessing
all
the
riches
power
honours
and
accumulated
pleasures
that
this
world
can
bestow
should
we
not
blush
to
own
even
a
wish
to
detain
him
from
such
a
station
what
but
a
love
of
ourselves
superior
to
that
which
we
bear
to
our
friend
could
suggest
such
a
thought
how
much
more
to
be
desired
then
is
the
change
to
which
my
mother
looks
forward
with
an
assured
hope
but
there
is
something
dismal
in
the
idea
of
death
is
only
our
prejudices
make
it
so
i
have
been
endeavouring
for
many
days
past
to
familiarise
it
to
my
thoughts
and
to
consider
death
only
as
the
name
of
a
region
through
which
my
mother
is
to
pass
in
order
to
get
at
that
delightful
country
to
which
she
is
invited
and
whither
shall
assuredly
follow
her
such
is
the
present
frame
of
my
mind
judge
then
my
sister
if
this
philosophy
will
not
bear
me
up
against
the
unexpected
blow
when
it
falls
upon
me
strange
my
cecilia
that
this
best
of
parents
who
had
always
so
tenderly
loved
me
expresses
now
not
the
least
uneasiness
at
the
forlorn
condition
in
which
she
must
soon
leave
me
her
thoughts
are
employed
on
higher
objects
and
she
seems
to
have
weaned
herself
from
all
worldly
attachments
i
am
going
from
you
my
daughter
said
she
to
me
just
now
and
have
no
other
legacy
to
leave
you
but
a
parent
blessing
your
brother
possesses
all
when
i
die
i
wish
you
had
the
means
of
enjoying
life
with
comfort
but
you
must
be
contented
see
that
you
bear
your
lot
as
becomes
you
i
perceive
your
grief
for
the
melancholy
condition
to
which
i
am
now
reduced
but
added
she
smiling
i
shall
soon
be
released
remember
how
david
behaved
on
the
death
of
that
son
whose
life
he
had
so
earnestly
besought
of
his
maker
let
that
serve
you
as
an
example
not
to
give
yourself
up
to
unprofitable
sorrow
bring
up
your
children
in
the
principles
that
i
taught
and
god
will
take
care
of
them
for
have
never
seen
the
righteous
forsaken
nor
his
seed
begging
their
she
said
she
found
herself
drowsy
and
desired
me
to
leave
her
for
a
while
i
have
left
her
going
i
hope
to
get
a
little
sleep
she
breathes
with
so
much
difficulty
that
she
can
not
bear
to
lie
down
and
never
gets
any
rest
but
by
snatches
as
she
sits
in
an
supported
by
pillows
how
heavy
and
cast
down
do
i
feel
my
spirits
but
i
know
the
worst
is
it
is
all
over
and
my
mother
blessed
woman
opens
not
her
eyes
again
but
to
a
joyful
resurrection
oh
my
dear
there
is
no
terror
in
death
when
he
seizes
us
not
unprepared
i
went
into
my
mother
chamber
in
about
half
an
hour
after
i
had
quitted
it
at
her
desire
i
found
her
leaning
back
in
her
chair
her
eyes
shut
and
a
complacent
air
diffused
over
her
face
which
made
me
hope
that
her
slumber
was
sweeter
and
more
profound
than
usual
i
sat
down
by
her
to
contemplate
her
benign
countenance
and
was
some
minutes
before
i
discovered
that
she
did
not
breathe
i
took
her
hand
she
had
no
pulse
and
i
soon
found
that
the
happy
spirit
had
escaped
from
its
house
of
clay
may
die
the
death
of
the
righteous
and
my
latter
end
be
like
hers
no
murmurings
no
no
my
sister
i
will
be
patience
itself
i
have
sent
the
remains
of
my
venerable
parent
down
to
there
to
be
interred
with
her
ancestors
i
wrote
my
brother
an
account
of
her
death
on
the
day
it
happened
but
have
as
yet
received
no
answer
unnatural
son
but
i
will
not
reproach
him
some
accident
might
have
prevented
his
writing
immediately
on
the
receipt
of
my
letter
he
never
intirely
forsook
the
duty
he
owed
his
mother
but
he
has
of
late
been
quite
estranged
from
us
his
wife
vain
weak
and
imperious
governs
him
totally
i
must
now
begin
to
look
about
me
for
a
place
of
abode
suited
to
my
present
circumstances
my
whole
income
would
not
pay
more
than
half
the
rent
of
these
lodgings
in
which
i
have
lived
with
my
dear
mother
my
poor
patty
i
am
grieved
for
i
begged
of
her
to
seek
another
mistress
who
might
be
able
to
reward
her
merit
and
provide
for
her
as
she
deserves
but
the
worthy
affectionate
girl
told
me
it
would
break
her
heart
if
i
talked
of
parting
with
her
you
must
have
a
servant
of
some
sort
madam
said
she
why
may
not
i
do
as
well
as
another
if
i
were
able
to
make
you
a
proper
return
patty
said
i
you
should
not
leave
me
but
i
can
not
afford
to
pay
a
servant
of
your
abilities
as
you
deserve
and
i
must
be
my
own
maid
for
the
future
never
never
madam
cried
the
honest
creature
bursting
into
tears
while
i
have
hands
to
serve
you
let
me
but
attend
on
you
and
the
two
dear
children
i
desire
i
want
nothing
your
goodness
has
all
along
supplied
me
so
that
i
am
sure
i
have
clothes
enough
to
serve
me
during
my
life
and
if
i
could
not
put
up
with
the
same
humble
way
of
living
that
my
mistress
does
sure
i
should
be
a
presumptuous
wretch
my
tears
thanked
the
grateful
girl
and
taking
her
by
the
hand
i
told
her
that
i
would
not
talk
of
parting
for
the
present
but
when
any
thing
worth
her
acceptance
offered
i
should
then
insist
on
her
embracing
it
i
am
determined
to
retire
to
some
village
at
a
distance
from
london
and
either
to
take
a
little
cottage
to
myself
or
board
with
my
children
at
some
as
i
shall
find
most
convenient
fifty
pounds
a
year
will
be
but
a
slender
support
for
three
persons
brought
up
in
affluence
my
little
ones
indeed
will
not
now
be
sensible
of
the
change
and
by
the
time
they
are
grown
up
they
will
be
so
inured
to
their
homely
board
that
they
will
not
i
hope
aspire
after
what
can
not
consistently
perhaps
with
virtue
lie
within
their
reach
after
paying
the
expences
of
my
mother
funeral
discharging
our
lodgings
and
some
other
demands
i
find
my
purse
will
be
so
extremely
reduced
that
i
shall
have
but
barely
enough
to
keep
out
want
till
my
small
income
becomes
due
to
me
i
must
therefore
for
the
present
defer
putting
my
scheme
into
execution
as
i
am
not
qualified
to
undertake
a
journey
with
my
little
family
especially
as
i
am
as
yet
uncertain
what
place
to
fix
on
for
my
residence
neither
will
i
afford
my
brother
though
i
have
no
reason
to
expect
any
thing
from
him
a
farther
pretence
for
reproaching
me
by
giving
him
room
to
say
i
left
london
without
consulting
him
or
waiting
for
his
return
to
it
i
shall
therefore
look
out
a
lodging
of
a
small
price
where
i
will
conceal
myself
from
every
body
that
knows
me
and
wait
for
sir
george
arrival
how
happy
you
make
me
my
ever
dear
friend
by
your
approbation
of
my
conduct
since
my
receiving
your
last
packet
which
came
into
my
hand
late
last
night
i
am
better
reconciled
to
my
present
lot
than
i
was
before
i
heard
from
you
i
not
do
you
say
after
my
solemn
promise
given
to
miss
burchell
than
use
my
utmost
endeavours
to
promote
her
marriage
with
mr
faulkland
true
i
could
not
but
i
wish
you
had
entered
more
into
my
sentiments
in
regard
to
those
punctilios
which
you
tell
me
you
think
have
been
got
over
if
that
young
woman
had
been
out
of
the
question
i
could
not
help
smiling
at
your
wish
unchristian
as
it
was
but
my
dear
if
that
to
happen
do
you
think
mr
faulkland
so
void
of
reason
nay
of
feeling
as
after
all
that
has
past
to
persevere
or
if
he
did
that
i
could
be
so
mean
as
to
owe
the
very
bread
that
i
and
my
children
should
eat
to
his
generosity
would
you
my
cecilia
wish
to
see
your
friend
so
humbled
is
not
in
the
power
even
of
the
cold
hard
hand
of
poverty
itself
to
dash
me
so
low
as
that
would
do
but
where
is
the
need
of
forming
resolutions
or
even
making
declarations
about
what
never
happen
i
see
notwithstanding
that
you
think
my
heart
has
done
itself
some
violence
you
know
that
heart
too
well
for
me
to
attempt
to
hide
from
you
its
secret
workings
i
own
to
you
honestly
i
now
feel
my
own
unhappiness
in
its
full
extent
i
look
back
and
take
a
survey
of
the
past
and
can
not
help
thinking
that
i
have
had
the
most
wayward
fate
allotted
me
that
ever
woman
had
disappointment
in
a
first
love
has
i
think
been
ever
accounted
a
grief
scarce
surmountable
even
by
time
but
this
can
only
be
the
case
where
the
heart
extremely
vulnerable
by
nature
like
miss
burchell
suffers
itself
to
be
so
entirely
immersed
in
that
passion
that
all
other
duties
of
life
are
swallowed
up
in
it
and
where
an
indolent
turn
of
mind
a
want
of
rational
avocations
and
perhaps
of
a
new
object
all
contribute
to
indulge
and
confirm
the
disease
this
you
know
was
not
my
case
i
loved
is
true
but
it
was
with
temperance
and
though
my
disappointment
afflicted
me
it
did
not
subdue
me
i
got
the
better
of
it
i
think
i
got
the
better
of
it
even
before
i
married
but
sure
i
am
i
totally
conquered
all
remembrance
of
it
after
i
became
a
wife
i
then
laid
down
a
new
scheme
of
happiness
and
was
for
a
time
in
possession
of
it
how
i
was
thrown
from
this
is
still
bitter
to
remembrance
you
well
know
what
i
suffered
when
i
found
myself
deprived
of
my
husband
love
and
suspected
of
a
crime
at
which
my
soul
shrunk
but
it
pleased
the
just
god
to
deliver
me
from
this
heavy
misfortune
and
i
think
the
happiest
days
of
my
marriage
were
those
which
i
passed
with
mr
arnold
after
our
reunion
then
it
was
i
was
thoroughly
sensible
that
the
heart
love
a
second
time
truly
and
ardently
but
i
was
soon
again
plunged
into
affliction
by
the
death
of
a
husband
endeared
to
me
more
than
ever
by
his
misfortunes
my
grief
for
him
was
proportionate
to
my
love
yet
my
friend
as
time
is
an
universal
conqueror
it
might
have
healed
this
wound
as
well
as
the
former
one
and
a
few
a
very
few
years
would
perhaps
have
disposed
me
to
return
mr
faulkland
still
unabated
passion
if
a
variety
of
circumstances
had
not
interposed
that
strongly
forbad
our
union
convinced
as
i
was
of
this
i
acted
agreeably
to
the
dictates
both
of
my
reason
and
my
conscience
in
persuading
mr
faulkland
to
make
miss
burchell
his
wife
i
should
have
been
grieved
and
mortified
had
he
rejected
her
and
i
had
determined
never
to
have
seen
him
more
yet
how
deceitful
is
the
human
heart
this
very
act
which
i
laboured
with
so
much
assiduity
to
accomplish
and
on
the
accomplishment
of
which
i
had
founded
i
know
not
how
a
sort
of
contentment
for
myself
has
been
the
very
means
of
destroying
what
little
peace
of
mind
i
was
beginning
to
taste
before
sure
that
man
was
born
to
torment
me
in
a
variety
of
ways
if
i
was
disappointed
in
my
early
love
i
had
however
duty
and
a
consciousness
of
what
i
then
thought
superior
worth
to
support
me
if
on
his
account
i
suffered
cruel
and
injurious
aspersions
the
innocence
of
my
own
heart
bore
me
up
under
it
but
he
has
at
length
found
the
way
to
punish
me
without
leaving
me
any
resource
my
pride
is
of
no
use
he
has
raised
himself
in
my
esteem
superior
to
every
thing
his
whole
behaviour
so
generous
so
candid
a
love
so
disinterested
so
fervent
what
noble
what
uncommon
proofs
has
he
given
me
of
it
and
at
length
what
a
triumphant
sacrifice
has
he
made
of
that
overruling
passion
to
the
sober
calls
of
reason
and
humanity
he
has
left
me
my
dear
to
gaze
after
him
with
grateful
admiration
and
sometimes
perhaps
to
sigh
that
our
fates
rendered
it
impossible
for
us
to
meet
but
if
i
do
sometimes
sigh
it
is
not
at
the
advantages
of
fortune
which
i
might
have
enjoyed
with
him
no
no
surrounded
as
i
am
with
distress
i
do
not
envy
miss
burchell
affluence
or
splendor
if
motive
could
have
had
weight
with
me
i
might
have
been
mean
enough
not
to
have
acted
as
i
have
done
is
the
qualities
of
the
mind
i
esteem
i
think
our
souls
have
something
congenial
in
them
and
that
we
were
originally
designed
for
each
other
and
if
i
believed
the
doctrine
which
teaches
us
that
there
are
little
officious
spirits
that
preside
over
the
actions
of
men
i
should
think
that
our
two
evil
geniuses
laid
their
heads
together
in
conjunction
with
miss
active
demon
to
thwart
and
cross
all
our
measures
i
have
nothing
now
left
but
to
pray
for
the
happiness
of
one
whose
lot
in
this
life
he
has
suffered
to
determine
and
to
beseech
heaven
that
he
may
never
stand
in
that
fatal
predicament
which
sir
george
with
such
outrageous
barbarity
marked
out
in
his
vile
letter
i
now
return
to
myself
and
to
my
present
state
which
i
think
i
may
say
brings
up
the
rear
of
my
misfortunes
let
the
chastisement
stop
here
and
i
shall
bow
me
to
it
with
resignation
ah
my
cecilia
what
an
aggravation
is
here
to
the
already
too
deep
regret
i
began
to
feel
on
mr
faulkland
account
his
triumph
over
me
is
now
complete
in
sorting
my
mother
papers
as
i
am
to
leave
these
lodgings
tomorrow
i
found
that
letter
which
mr
faulkland
wrote
to
my
brother
from
bath
you
may
remember
i
told
you
my
mother
had
in
her
resentment
flung
it
to
sir
george
and
that
as
it
happened
to
fall
on
the
ground
he
had
quitted
the
room
in
a
passion
without
taking
it
up
my
mother
i
suppose
when
she
cooled
laid
it
by
though
i
dare
say
she
never
looked
into
it
afterwards
read
it
and
see
by
what
a
fatality
we
have
been
governed
mr
faulkland
letter
to
sir
george
bidulph
may
you
mortify
me
my
dear
bidulph
when
you
tell
me
of
the
happiness
i
lost
by
staying
so
long
at
bath
ladies
are
impatient
to
see
say
you
ah
sir
george
thou
hast
spoke
better
of
me
than
i
deserve
i
fear
am
sadly
out
of
humour
with
myself
at
present
i
have
got
into
a
very
foolish
sort
of
a
scrape
here
my
wrist
is
quite
well
and
i
should
have
thrown
myself
at
miss
bidulph
feet
before
now
but
to
tell
you
a
secret
my
virtue
not
being
proof
against
temptation
i
have
been
intercepted
but
a
slight
lapse
however
a
flying
affair
neither
my
honour
nor
my
heart
in
the
question
a
little
vagrant
cupid
has
contented
himself
with
picking
my
pocket
just
lightly
fluttering
through
my
breast
and
away
you
fallen
so
low
as
that
faulkland
say
you
to
the
favour
of
the
fair
no
george
no
not
quite
so
contemptible
as
that
neither
and
yet
faith
i
did
it
too
for
it
cost
me
three
hundred
pounds
but
the
lady
to
whom
i
am
obliged
knows
nothing
of
this
part
of
her
own
history
at
least
i
hope
so
for
my
credit
sake
the
case
in
short
is
this
an
old
gouty
officer
and
his
wife
a
very
notable
dame
a
fine
woman
too
happened
to
lodge
in
the
same
house
with
me
the
man
came
hither
to
get
rid
of
his
aches
the
lady
of
her
money
and
her
virtue
if
she
has
any
for
she
is
eternally
at
the
card
tables
the
conduct
of
this
hopeful
guide
came
a
niece
of
the
husband
an
extremely
fine
girl
innocent
too
i
believe
and
the
best
dancer
i
ever
saw
i
do
know
how
it
happened
but
she
took
a
fancy
to
me
which
upon
my
word
and
i
am
sure
you
have
no
doubts
of
me
i
was
far
from
wishing
to
improve
you
know
i
always
despise
the
mean
triumph
of
gaining
a
heart
for
which
i
could
not
give
another
in
return
i
saw
with
pain
her
growing
inclination
for
me
but
as
we
lived
in
the
same
house
and
met
every
day
in
the
rooms
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
avoid
her
as
much
as
i
wished
to
do
the
aunt
i
found
had
her
eyes
upon
me
and
took
some
pains
to
promote
a
liking
on
my
side
i
saw
her
design
and
was
so
much
upon
my
guard
that
she
who
i
soon
found
was
an
adept
in
almost
despaired
of
gaining
her
ends
the
young
lady
inclination
however
seemed
to
increase
a
pair
of
fine
blue
eyes
told
me
so
every
day
and
i
was
upon
the
point
of
flying
to
avoid
the
soft
contagion
when
an
accident
happened
that
totally
overthrew
all
my
good
resolutions
had
not
seen
the
young
lady
for
two
or
three
days
i
enquired
for
her
and
her
aunt
answered
with
a
mysterious
smile
she
is
ill
poor
thing
why
do
you
look
in
upon
her
and
ask
her
how
she
does
i
replied
if
the
lady
will
permit
me
i
will
do
myself
that
honour
and
intended
literally
to
have
kept
my
word
by
just
asking
her
at
her
chamber
door
how
she
did
are
very
cruel
said
the
aunt
would
you
persuade
me
that
you
do
know
the
girl
is
in
love
with
you
oh
your
servant
madam
if
you
think
me
vain
i
thank
you
for
the
reprimand
come
come
said
she
this
is
all
affectation
we
drink
tea
with
her
this
evening
upon
my
word
said
i
if
i
am
to
believe
what
you
say
i
think
you
ought
not
to
desire
me
i
am
not
blind
to
the
young
lady
merit
but
am
so
unfortunate
as
not
to
have
it
in
my
power
to
make
such
returns
as
she
deserves
i
found
the
occasion
required
my
being
serious
you
have
not
love
said
she
you
may
at
least
have
a
little
complaisance
was
there
ever
such
a
barbarian
not
to
go
and
see
a
woman
that
is
dying
for
him
i
promised
to
bring
you
and
she
expects
you
what
is
the
pretty
creature
afraid
of
patting
my
cheek
i
stay
by
it
all
the
while
there
was
no
withstanding
this
i
promised
to
wait
on
her
knocked
at
my
door
about
six
and
looking
in
asked
if
the
coy
narcissus
was
ready
i
went
with
her
and
she
led
me
directly
to
her
niece
chamber
the
young
lady
looked
pale
and
languishing
but
very
pretty
i
was
really
grieved
to
see
her
and
enquired
with
an
unaffected
concern
after
her
health
the
were
set
and
i
tried
to
force
something
like
conversation
but
i
believe
i
was
rather
formal
we
had
done
tea
the
aunt
looked
at
her
watch
started
off
her
chair
said
she
had
outstaid
her
appointment
with
the
party
she
was
to
meet
at
cards
and
turning
to
me
i
hope
sir
you
will
have
the
to
stay
with
my
niece
and
then
hurried
out
of
the
room
i
begged
leave
to
hand
her
to
her
chair
intending
to
take
that
opportunity
of
slipping
away
and
resolved
to
quit
the
house
the
next
morning
but
the
determined
gipsey
was
prepared
for
this
motion
and
insisting
that
i
should
not
stir
thrust
me
back
from
the
door
which
she
shut
and
flew
down
stairs
was
to
become
of
me
now
george
my
situation
was
dangerous
and
really
critical
to
be
short
i
forgot
my
prudence
and
found
the
young
lady
heart
too
too
tender
never
felt
remorse
before
i
never
had
cause
i
accuse
myself
of
indiscretion
but
i
have
not
the
aggravating
addition
to
my
fault
of
oaths
and
promises
to
fly
in
my
face
i
made
none
love
foolish
love
did
all
and
led
a
willing
victim
to
his
altar
who
asked
nothing
in
return
for
the
sacrifice
she
offered
and
received
nothing
but
unavailing
repentance
on
my
side
know
not
any
thing
now
that
would
give
me
so
much
pleasure
as
to
find
that
the
girl
hated
me
heartily
though
i
have
given
her
no
cause
a
just
reparation
i
can
not
make
her
every
thing
forbids
that
thought
i
do
not
consider
myself
as
free
but
if
i
were
so
i
am
not
a
seducer
and
therefore
do
not
think
myself
bound
to
carry
my
penitence
to
such
lengths
the
damned
aunt
has
been
the
serpent
and
here
let
me
explain
to
you
what
i
call
buying
the
favour
you
must
know
the
aunt
one
night
the
greatest
part
of
which
she
had
spent
at
hazard
lost
two
hundred
pounds
at
least
she
told
me
so
the
next
morning
and
with
tears
in
her
eyes
besought
me
in
the
most
earnest
manner
to
lend
her
that
sum
she
said
she
should
be
undone
if
her
husband
were
to
know
it
and
that
she
would
pay
me
in
a
very
few
days
as
she
had
as
much
due
to
her
from
different
people
who
had
lost
to
her
at
play
though
our
very
short
acquaintance
could
hardly
warrant
her
making
such
a
request
i
nevertheless
did
not
hesitate
but
gave
her
the
money
directly
she
meant
indeed
to
pay
me
but
it
was
in
a
different
coin
and
this
i
suppose
was
the
price
she
set
on
the
unhappy
girl
honour
reflections
on
this
unlucky
affair
make
me
very
grave
i
have
explained
my
situation
to
the
young
lady
and
expressed
my
concern
at
not
having
it
in
my
power
to
be
any
other
than
a
friend
to
her
she
blames
her
own
weakness
and
her
aunt
conduct
but
does
not
reproach
me
she
can
not
with
justice
yet
i
wish
she
would
for
then
i
should
reproach
myself
less
a
foolish
business
and
i
must
get
off
as
handsomely
as
i
can
prithee
bidulph
say
something
to
encourage
me
and
put
me
into
more
favour
with
myself
you
have
often
been
my
confessor
but
i
never
wanted
absolution
so
much
as
now
nor
ever
was
so
well
intitled
to
it
for
i
am
really
full
of
penitence
and
look
mortified
you
would
pity
me
i
am
ashamed
of
having
been
surprised
into
a
folly
i
who
to
have
been
upon
my
guard
knowing
the
natural
impetuosity
of
my
temper
must
not
conclude
without
telling
you
that
this
very
morning
the
precious
aunt
instead
of
paying
me
the
two
hundred
pounds
she
had
of
me
before
very
modestly
requested
i
would
oblige
her
with
another
hundred
to
redeem
a
pair
of
diamond
which
she
had
been
obliged
to
part
with
for
the
supply
of
some
other
necessary
demands
and
with
abundance
of
smooth
speeches
she
assured
me
in
a
fortnight
she
would
pay
me
all
together
having
notes
to
that
value
which
would
then
become
due
to
her
i
was
such
a
booby
as
to
give
it
to
why
fare
it
well
i
never
expect
to
see
a
shilling
of
it
she
thinks
perhaps
there
is
value
received
for
it
vile
woman
the
affair
fortunately
for
us
all
has
not
taken
wind
and
for
me
the
names
of
both
aunt
and
niece
may
ever
stand
enrolled
amongst
those
of
chaste
matrons
and
virgins
the
family
quits
this
place
soon
as
the
old
gentleman
is
better
thank
you
for
your
care
in
relation
to
my
house
i
hope
to
take
possession
of
it
in
a
week
or
ten
days
you
are
very
good
in
fixing
me
so
near
yourself
adieu
am
what
do
you
think
of
this
letter
my
cecilia
written
in
confidence
to
my
brother
mr
faulkland
could
not
conceive
it
probable
that
any
body
but
sir
george
should
ever
see
it
he
had
no
reason
therefore
to
gloss
over
any
of
the
circumstances
i
seen
it
but
in
time
oh
what
anguish
of
heart
might
we
all
have
been
spared
miss
burchell
singly
as
she
would
have
borne
the
punishment
of
her
folly
my
mother
had
not
patience
to
read
this
letter
through
nice
and
punctilious
as
her
virtue
was
she
passed
a
censure
on
the
crime
in
gross
without
admitting
any
palliating
circumstance
but
i
blame
her
not
the
excellence
of
her
own
morals
made
her
scrupulous
in
weighing
those
of
others
she
read
the
letter
in
a
cursory
way
and
it
is
plain
but
half
of
it
prepossessed
as
she
was
before
by
knowing
the
material
point
the
account
was
given
with
levity
at
the
mention
of
the
young
lady
then
she
understood
he
had
bought
her
of
her
aunt
there
is
a
paragraph
which
like
it
and
to
be
sure
she
attended
not
to
the
explanation
fatal
oversight
she
read
not
far
enough
to
have
this
matter
cleared
up
she
took
nothing
but
the
bare
facts
into
her
account
a
young
lady
dishonoured
her
disgrace
likely
to
be
public
then
her
tenderness
for
the
man
who
had
undone
her
and
that
man
rejecting
her
and
on
the
point
of
marrying
another
these
were
the
only
points
of
view
in
which
my
mother
beheld
the
story
her
justice
her
humanity
and
her
religion
prompted
her
to
act
as
she
did
and
her
conduct
stands
fully
acquitted
to
my
judgment
though
my
heart
must
upon
this
full
conviction
of
mr
faulkland
honour
sigh
at
recollecting
the
past
i
know
that
the
memory
of
my
mother
own
first
disastrous
love
wrought
strongly
on
her
mind
she
was
warm
in
her
passions
liable
to
deep
impressions
and
always
adhered
strictly
to
those
opinions
she
first
imbibed
her
education
had
been
severe
and
recluse
and
she
had
drawn
all
her
ideas
of
mankind
from
her
own
father
and
mine
who
i
have
been
told
were
both
men
of
exemplary
lives
from
all
these
considerations
i
must
again
say
that
i
entirely
acquit
my
dear
mother
in
regard
to
her
whole
conduct
however
i
have
suffered
by
it
i
am
now
fixed
in
a
very
humble
situation
shall
i
own
it
to
you
my
cecilia
i
was
shocked
at
the
change
a
room
two
pairs
of
stairs
high
with
a
closet
and
a
small
indifferent
parlour
compose
the
whole
of
my
apartment
hither
did
my
faithful
patty
my
two
children
and
myself
remove
this
day
it
put
us
not
to
much
trouble
having
nothing
to
take
with
us
but
our
wearing
apparel
which
is
all
the
worldly
goods
of
which
i
am
now
possessed
when
i
wrote
to
lady
v
which
was
a
day
or
two
before
my
death
i
mentioned
not
that
she
was
then
in
so
dangerous
a
way
i
know
the
generosity
and
good
nature
of
that
worthy
woman
but
i
have
already
been
too
much
obliged
to
her
to
lay
any
fresh
tax
on
her
friendship
which
i
am
sure
she
would
too
readily
pay
if
she
were
acquainted
with
my
situation
i
shall
therefore
as
long
as
i
can
defer
acquainting
her
with
my
mother
death
and
when
i
do
i
shall
not
give
her
room
to
suspect
that
my
brother
has
cast
me
off
which
i
have
now
too
much
reason
to
believe
he
has
otherwise
sure
in
more
than
a
fortnight
he
might
have
found
time
to
write
to
me
i
neither
expect
ceremony
nor
tenderness
from
him
but
the
occasion
of
my
letter
demanded
some
notice
patty
has
just
now
been
informed
that
lady
sarah
bidulph
is
arrived
in
town
she
met
one
of
their
servants
who
told
her
that
my
brother
is
not
come
with
her
it
seems
they
parted
on
the
road
he
is
gone
to
sidney
castle
which
is
now
his
and
lady
sarah
chose
to
come
to
london
she
has
i
find
been
in
london
four
days
though
she
has
not
yet
vouchsafed
to
send
me
any
notice
of
her
arrival
she
could
not
be
at
a
loss
where
to
find
me
as
i
left
my
direction
at
my
former
lodging
in
case
of
any
letter
or
message
coming
from
any
of
my
friends
though
i
desired
the
people
of
the
house
not
to
inform
any
indifferent
visitants
where
i
was
to
be
found
though
george
has
in
his
turbulent
way
renounced
me
as
his
sister
yet
sure
his
wife
whom
i
never
disobliged
ought
not
to
depart
so
from
humanity
and
common
good
breeding
as
not
to
enquire
after
the
sister
of
her
husband
who
has
an
occasion
of
grief
so
recent
in
which
she
ought
to
partake
i
shall
not
however
take
notice
of
this
slight
but
am
preparing
to
send
patty
to
her
with
an
enquiry
after
her
health
and
to
know
when
my
brother
is
expected
in
patty
is
just
returned
from
her
embassy
to
lady
sarah
i
will
give
you
the
conversation
she
had
with
her
patty
sent
in
her
message
with
great
respect
by
a
footman
and
waited
for
her
answer
in
the
hall
though
her
pretty
figure
and
genteel
had
induced
the
servant
to
ask
her
into
the
room
lady
sarah
was
alone
in
the
parlour
and
desired
her
to
be
called
to
the
door
so
young
woman
said
she
your
mistress
desires
to
know
when
sir
george
will
be
in
town
i
am
really
surprised
after
the
letter
she
received
from
him
that
she
can
fancy
sir
george
means
to
concern
himself
about
her
do
you
know
her
business
with
him
you
are
in
your
mistress
secrets
i
suppose
i
do
not
know
madam
answered
patty
what
particular
business
my
lady
may
have
but
i
believe
it
would
be
a
comfort
to
her
to
see
her
brother
in
her
present
melancholy
circumstances
i
do
know
that
there
is
any
thing
uncommonly
melancholy
in
her
circumstances
replied
the
lady
her
mother
years
and
infirmities
made
her
death
a
thing
to
be
looked
for
i
suppose
your
mistress
is
not
in
my
poor
ingenuous
patty
said
she
blushed
at
the
cruel
indifference
with
which
lady
sarah
said
this
not
in
immediate
want
madam
i
hope
but
your
ladyship
must
needs
think
she
is
in
a
destitute
way
with
two
children
and
but
fifty
pounds
a
year
in
the
world
what
do
you
mean
woman
cried
lady
sarah
it
is
impossible
but
lady
bidulph
must
have
left
money
behind
her
sir
george
i
am
sure
has
got
nothing
but
what
she
could
not
keep
from
him
patty
answered
lady
bidulph
madam
left
no
money
behind
her
more
than
what
was
barely
sufficient
to
defray
some
necessary
expences
that
occurred
immediately
after
her
death
well
and
so
your
mistress
i
suppose
after
having
behaved
so
ill
as
she
has
done
to
her
brother
expects
he
should
provide
handsomely
for
her
and
her
children
children
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
i
know
not
madam
returned
patty
what
my
lady
expectations
are
but
i
believe
she
would
be
very
glad
to
see
sir
george
before
she
goes
out
of
town
or
at
least
inform
him
of
her
design
what
her
design
pray
asked
lady
sarah
to
retire
into
the
country
madam
as
she
has
not
wherewithal
to
subsist
on
in
london
she
ca
do
better
i
think
said
the
lady
where
does
she
live
now
my
poor
maid
who
thought
this
question
tended
to
the
proud
woman
calling
on
or
at
least
sending
to
me
made
haste
to
inform
her
she
lodges
madam
at
a
milliner
at
the
corner
of
the
haymarket
the
left
hand
as
you
turn
oh
dear
pray
stop
you
need
not
be
so
particular
i
have
no
design
of
paying
her
a
visit
in
her
my
only
reason
for
enquiring
was
to
know
whether
she
had
thought
proper
to
keep
those
expensive
lodgings
her
mother
was
in
in
expectation
of
sir
continuing
in
them
my
lady
has
no
such
view
i
believe
madam
well
you
may
tell
your
that
if
she
will
go
out
of
town
with
her
children
i
will
prevail
on
sir
george
to
allow
her
something
he
will
not
be
in
town
this
month
so
that
she
need
not
wait
for
his
arrival
she
might
if
she
would
have
been
guided
by
her
brother
have
been
a
credit
to
her
friends
instead
of
what
she
now
is
patty
owns
she
was
so
full
of
indignation
that
she
wished
at
that
moment
not
to
have
been
a
servant
that
she
might
have
reproached
her
with
her
oh
my
dear
these
are
the
stings
of
poverty
it
is
not
the
hard
bed
nor
the
homely
board
but
the
oppressive
insolence
of
proud
prosperity
is
that
only
which
can
inflict
a
wound
on
the
ingenuous
mind
as
for
that
mean
woman
i
despise
her
too
much
to
suffer
myself
to
be
obliged
to
her
will
endeavour
to
prevail
on
my
if
his
own
heart
can
not
prevail
on
him
i
disclaim
her
influence
i
know
she
means
not
to
use
it
in
my
favour
on
the
contrary
i
make
no
doubt
but
she
will
endeavour
to
irritate
sir
george
gainst
me
by
misrepresentations
her
pride
makes
her
wish
to
have
an
indigent
relation
out
of
the
way
yet
her
avarice
would
not
suffer
her
to
enable
me
to
retire
and
she
will
make
my
continuing
here
through
necessity
a
pretence
for
still
any
assistance
from
me
let
it
be
so
i
would
rather
submit
to
the
most
abject
drudgery
than
owe
a
wretched
dependant
existence
to
such
a
woman
i
am
sure
my
brother
notwithstanding
his
resentment
if
he
knew
what
my
situation
truly
is
would
not
behave
with
cruelty
but
my
mind
is
not
become
so
sordid
fallen
as
i
am
as
to
turn
petitioner
for
relief
but
no
more
my
cecilia
let
not
my
fate
interrupt
your
happiness
i
have
had
a
letter
from
mrs
faulkland
filled
with
the
overflowings
of
a
joyful
heart
she
says
mr
faulkland
is
so
delighted
with
the
country
he
is
in
and
finds
his
estate
capable
of
such
vast
improvement
that
he
thinks
of
making
a
longer
residence
there
than
he
at
first
intended
the
rather
as
he
has
some
suspicions
that
his
agent
has
not
acted
faithfully
by
him
and
as
he
is
sure
the
extensive
plan
that
he
has
now
laid
down
will
be
better
executed
under
his
own
eye
he
purposes
building
a
little
convenient
lodge
on
a
very
charming
spot
in
the
centre
of
his
estate
where
he
may
reside
whilst
his
works
are
carrying
on
so
that
mrs
faulkland
promises
herself
much
pleasure
in
spending
her
time
partly
there
and
partly
in
dublin
she
has
already
made
a
large
circle
of
acquaintance
and
bestows
high
encomiums
on
the
great
politeness
and
hospitality
with
which
they
are
received
by
all
the
fashionable
people
in
the
county
she
knows
not
of
my
mother
death
yet
in
my
answer
to
her
letter
i
can
not
avoid
mentioning
it
though
i
could
wish
for
obvious
reasons
to
conceal
it
mr
faulkland
well
knows
the
ruin
of
our
fortune
and
though
he
can
not
suppose
while
i
have
a
brother
living
that
i
am
driven
to
such
streights
yet
i
know
what
his
liberal
heart
may
suggest
to
him
on
this
occasion
which
might
lay
me
under
fresh
difficulties
i
have
but
just
now
apprised
lady
v
of
the
decease
of
my
dear
mother
but
have
not
insinuated
any
other
grief
than
the
loss
of
a
tender
parent
and
an
agreeable
companion
indeed
i
have
carried
my
dissimulation
so
far
as
not
to
desire
this
lady
to
change
her
address
to
me
lest
if
i
gave
her
my
present
direction
she
might
be
led
to
think
necessity
had
obliged
me
to
change
my
former
lodgings
for
worse
i
shall
use
the
same
precaution
towards
mrs
faulkland
as
i
have
obtained
permission
from
the
gentlewoman
whose
house
i
lately
left
to
have
my
letters
sent
thither
when
i
go
into
the
country
a
general
direction
to
the
may
suffice
i
shall
now
look
out
for
some
little
spot
to
retire
to
where
i
can
support
life
on
the
cheapest
terms
in
two
months
i
shall
have
my
small
pittance
due
to
me
which
i
reserve
to
carry
me
out
of
town
and
to
settle
me
in
my
new
scheme
of
oeconomy
in
the
country
if
i
could
persuade
my
poor
patty
to
quit
me
and
see
her
settled
in
some
eligible
situation
i
should
then
have
no
material
concern
to
attend
to
but
the
bringing
up
my
children
in
the
paths
of
virtue
and
humility
humility
that
happy
frame
of
mind
on
which
so
much
of
our
temporal
as
well
as
our
eternal
welfare
depends
who
shall
say
now
is
the
measure
of
my
griefs
complete
providence
thou
canst
inflict
no
more
oh
my
sister
in
the
midst
of
other
sorrows
i
thought
not
of
one
that
still
remained
behind
my
children
my
two
little
angels
both
dangerously
ill
the
is
their
distemper
and
of
the
worst
kind
the
disease
has
been
hanging
over
them
for
some
days
and
my
close
attendance
on
them
prevented
me
from
using
my
pen
the
cruel
distemper
now
appears
with
the
most
malignant
symptoms
the
eldest
always
slept
with
me
i
have
resigned
my
bed
to
her
for
these
three
last
nights
and
have
watched
by
her
patty
has
done
the
same
by
the
youngest
a
humane
and
skilful
physician
attends
them
but
my
reliance
rests
not
on
him
three
days
and
nights
of
sorrowful
anxiety
have
at
length
produced
a
little
comfort
to
me
the
distemper
has
now
reached
one
crisis
whence
the
physician
can
form
a
judgment
with
some
degree
of
certainty
and
he
bids
me
hope
oh
if
it
were
not
for
that
healing
word
how
could
the
wretched
drag
on
existence
from
day
to
day
i
do
i
will
hope
for
there
is
a
merciful
providence
that
superintends
his
works
thank
god
thank
god
my
cecilia
the
dear
babes
are
out
of
danger
fifteen
melancholy
days
and
nights
has
their
disconsolate
mother
watched
by
the
poor
little
sufferers
but
i
am
fully
repaid
by
having
them
restored
to
my
prayers
they
are
now
able
to
sit
up
and
open
their
pretty
eyes
which
had
been
closed
for
so
many
days
and
to
add
to
my
satisfaction
i
think
they
will
not
be
marked
but
they
are
still
so
feeble
that
it
will
be
at
least
another
fortnight
before
i
can
think
of
venturing
their
little
tender
frames
out
of
doors
the
physician
care
and
diligence
deserved
a
greater
recompence
than
i
had
it
in
my
power
to
make
him
however
what
i
have
done
has
reduced
me
to
a
single
guinea
but
this
affects
me
not
i
shall
make
no
difficulty
of
parting
with
some
of
my
now
unnecessary
fineries
which
neither
i
nor
my
children
probably
will
ever
again
have
any
pretensions
to
wear
i
have
felt
the
wounds
of
grief
the
pangs
of
disappointment
and
the
smart
of
indignation
yet
was
my
heart
never
more
sensibly
affected
than
it
was
just
now
by
a
circumstance
proceeding
from
a
cause
very
different
from
all
these
i
had
taken
out
of
my
drawers
a
few
superfluous
ornaments
which
i
desired
patty
to
dispose
of
as
if
they
were
her
own
to
the
woman
where
we
lodge
being
things
in
her
own
way
of
business
the
poor
girl
looked
at
me
for
some
time
with
a
grief
in
her
countenance
that
pierced
me
to
the
soul
there
is
no
need
madam
said
she
with
her
voice
almost
stifled
there
is
no
need
i
hope
as
yet
for
this
you
consider
patty
said
i
that
the
children
weak
constitution
requires
now
a
more
than
ordinary
attention
to
their
diet
and
i
have
not
sufficient
to
supply
them
long
with
such
necessaries
as
they
want
i
have
no
occasion
for
these
trifles
and
i
can
not
see
my
little
ones
droop
for
want
of
such
comfortable
nourishment
as
may
restore
them
to
their
strength
nor
shall
they
want
it
madam
answered
patty
do
be
angry
with
me
madam
if
i
beg
you
will
let
me
use
my
endeavours
to
supply
them
what
do
you
mean
said
i
i
know
the
goodness
of
your
disposition
but
how
have
you
it
in
your
power
you
know
madam
said
she
i
am
pretty
expert
at
my
needle
and
as
our
landlady
has
always
abundance
of
work
on
her
hands
i
undertook
to
assist
her
and
have
for
this
fortnight
past
while
i
was
closely
confined
to
miss
room
finished
a
piece
of
curious
work
for
which
she
has
this
day
paid
me
thirty
shillings
you
amaze
me
said
i
i
never
saw
you
employed
otherwise
than
in
your
attendance
on
the
child
i
was
afraid
you
would
be
displeased
madam
she
replied
and
always
hid
my
work
when
you
came
into
the
room
which
i
could
easily
do
as
it
was
only
a
fine
piece
of
point
which
i
was
grounding
and
as
i
sat
up
night
and
day
i
had
an
opportunity
of
sticking
most
constantly
to
it
which
enabled
me
to
do
in
a
fortnight
what
to
another
hand
would
be
a
month
labour
now
madam
with
your
leave
i
can
go
on
in
this
manner
and
though
perhaps
i
can
not
always
earn
so
much
yet
i
am
sure
i
can
still
procure
enough
to
prevent
your
being
drove
to
the
necessity
of
parting
with
your
apparel
till
we
are
in
a
condition
to
leave
such
an
expensive
place
as
london
is
and
do
you
think
my
dear
patty
said
i
with
tears
of
affection
and
gratitude
in
my
eyes
that
i
will
consent
to
take
the
fruits
of
your
ingenious
and
honest
industry
from
you
no
no
if
you
can
find
time
by
these
means
to
procure
a
little
supply
for
your
own
pocket
do
so
but
i
will
not
suffer
you
to
expend
a
farthing
of
what
you
can
earn
on
my
account
i
saw
she
looked
distressed
and
confounded
excuse
me
madam
said
she
but
i
have
made
bold
to
lay
out
part
of
the
money
already
i
thought
the
poor
children
would
want
a
little
wine
to
nourish
them
and
indeed
madam
your
spirits
want
some
support
after
your
long
fatigue
i
have
bought
a
few
bottles
of
wine
madam
and
some
other
little
necessaries
i
hope
you
will
not
take
it
ill
i
pressed
the
affectionate
creature
hand
i
can
not
be
angry
with
you
patty
for
your
goodness
but
such
proofs
of
it
as
these
distress
me
more
than
my
wants
could
i
accept
of
your
kindness
for
this
time
but
insist
on
your
not
doing
such
a
thing
again
if
there
be
occasion
for
it
i
can
apply
to
my
needle
as
well
as
you
and
would
sooner
do
so
than
part
with
any
of
my
things
since
it
gives
you
so
much
uneasiness
the
poor
girl
was
rejoiced
at
my
acceptance
of
her
friendly
and
tender
offer
and
produced
her
little
purchase
which
was
indeed
both
seasonable
and
useful
i
had
this
day
a
letter
from
lady
v
i
send
you
a
copy
of
it
condole
with
you
my
dear
mrs
arnold
on
the
afflicting
loss
you
sustained
in
your
good
mother
death
you
mention
not
any
particular
consequences
from
this
accident
but
i
know
that
by
lady
bidulph
death
you
are
deprived
of
a
considerable
part
of
your
income
and
on
this
account
i
have
taken
the
liberty
of
friendship
to
send
you
a
supply
which
your
may
require
till
your
affairs
are
settled
upon
a
better
footing
me
know
how
you
and
your
brother
stand
if
he
should
not
be
so
kind
to
you
as
he
ought
i
insist
upon
your
looking
on
me
as
your
banker
who
know
not
how
to
make
so
good
a
use
of
my
income
as
sharing
it
with
those
i
love
as
i
do
you
am
the
supply
which
lady
v
mentioned
accompanied
this
letter
and
was
a
bank
bill
of
three
hundred
pounds
i
own
to
you
my
cecilia
that
my
first
emotions
were
only
those
of
joy
surprize
and
gratitude
for
so
unexpected
and
important
a
donation
but
when
those
were
a
little
subsided
i
began
to
reflect
on
the
nature
and
manner
of
this
noble
act
of
friendship
i
know
lady
v
is
one
of
the
best
women
living
she
is
generous
and
compassionate
and
has
always
honoured
me
with
a
particular
regard
yet
i
must
confess
to
you
her
present
now
comes
to
me
suspected
i
believe
i
told
you
that
lady
v
had
retired
into
lancashire
to
live
with
an
only
sister
she
has
there
this
lady
is
a
widow
and
i
have
since
been
informed
was
left
with
a
very
numerous
young
family
and
an
income
scarce
sufficient
to
support
them
genteely
they
are
now
most
of
them
grown
up
and
all
the
girls
of
which
there
are
five
unprovided
for
since
lady
v
departure
i
have
been
told
that
it
was
principally
on
account
of
these
young
girls
of
whom
she
is
extremely
fond
that
she
went
to
reside
with
her
sister
in
order
to
support
them
more
agreeably
to
their
rank
their
father
having
been
a
general
officer
and
a
man
of
high
birth
lady
v
jointure
is
a
thousand
pound
a
year
but
as
i
hear
the
family
make
a
respectable
figure
in
the
country
and
i
am
sure
lady
v
fondness
for
her
nieces
would
induce
her
to
save
what
she
could
in
order
to
leave
them
something
at
her
death
i
can
not
reconcile
it
to
her
prudence
notwithstanding
the
liberality
of
her
spirit
and
the
friendship
she
has
for
me
that
she
should
make
so
considerable
a
present
at
the
same
time
give
me
as
it
were
an
unbounded
letter
of
credit
on
her
had
she
sent
me
the
sixth
part
of
the
sum
i
should
not
have
doubted
its
being
only
the
effects
of
her
kindness
towards
me
and
in
her
present
situation
as
considerable
a
proof
of
it
as
she
ought
in
regard
to
have
given
to
one
whom
she
has
already
bound
under
strong
obligations
but
the
largeness
of
the
sum
renders
it
suspicious
and
to
tell
you
the
secret
inspirations
of
my
heart
i
fear
it
comes
from
a
different
quarter
i
made
mrs
faulkland
acquainted
with
my
mother
death
about
the
same
time
that
i
informed
lady
v
of
it
to
neither
did
i
give
the
most
distant
hint
of
my
circumstances
yet
mr
faulkland
knows
they
can
not
be
happy
he
too
knows
better
than
any
body
how
far
sir
resentment
may
carry
him
is
it
not
natural
then
my
dear
to
imagine
that
this
man
who
is
generosity
itself
should
have
taken
this
method
of
making
lady
v
the
channel
through
which
he
conveys
his
liberality
i
am
sure
it
must
be
so
it
is
three
weeks
since
lady
v
had
the
notice
of
my
mother
death
why
thought
she
not
sooner
of
reaching
out
her
supporting
hand
if
she
imagined
i
stood
in
need
of
it
i
gave
her
no
cause
to
believe
i
did
otherwise
i
make
no
question
of
her
ready
friendship
as
far
as
her
abilities
would
go
but
could
not
know
as
well
as
mr
faulkland
how
much
my
brother
was
exasperated
against
me
and
therefore
could
not
suppose
me
to
be
as
destitute
as
i
really
am
she
desires
to
know
how
my
brother
and
i
stand
this
question
is
not
her
sir
george
for
his
own
credit
perhaps
has
not
told
mr
faulkland
what
his
conduct
has
been
towards
me
but
he
wants
to
be
informed
contriving
man
i
will
disappoint
him
nor
shall
he
heap
such
obligations
on
me
as
must
sink
me
under
their
weight
i
will
not
receive
this
suspected
gift
of
lady
v
but
it
is
a
delicate
point
and
whilst
i
refuse
i
must
take
care
not
to
offend
i
will
send
lady
v
her
bill
back
again
but
in
such
a
manner
as
to
shew
her
i
refuse
her
gift
for
no
other
reason
but
its
being
too
valuable
see
my
cecilia
whether
i
have
succeeded
in
my
endeavours
to
refuse
with
a
good
grace
my
lady
v
offered
kindness
this
is
my
answer
to
her
to
lady
v
oppress
me
my
dear
and
ever
honoured
lady
v
by
a
generosity
and
friendship
that
knows
no
bounds
why
will
you
force
me
to
appear
proud
or
ungrateful
by
refusing
the
favours
of
so
true
a
friend
but
my
dear
madam
do
not
believe
me
either
the
one
or
the
other
had
you
sent
me
a
trifling
token
of
your
love
you
would
have
been
convinced
of
my
respect
for
you
by
the
thankfulness
with
which
i
would
have
accepted
it
but
do
not
seek
to
humble
me
so
far
my
good
lady
v
by
heaping
favours
on
me
which
i
can
never
have
a
prospect
of
returning
with
equal
respect
and
gratitude
permit
me
madam
to
return
your
too
considerable
present
i
can
not
in
honour
receive
a
liberality
which
i
am
so
little
intitled
to
and
the
less
as
justice
now
demands
that
your
bounteous
heart
so
diffusive
in
its
generosity
should
a
little
restrain
itself
can
not
say
that
my
circumstances
are
as
happy
as
they
have
been
yet
have
i
i
thank
heaven
accommodated
my
mind
to
them
my
brother
has
not
been
in
town
since
my
mother
death
but
i
am
not
without
hope
that
he
will
make
my
situation
easy
on
this
account
i
know
my
dear
lady
v
will
the
more
readily
pardon
my
refusal
of
her
obliging
offer
and
believe
that
her
goodness
is
not
bestowed
on
an
unthankful
heart
am
in
this
letter
i
her
bill
and
have
sent
it
off
did
i
not
well
my
cecilia
if
as
i
strongly
suspect
this
present
came
from
mr
faulkland
i
should
never
endure
myself
had
i
retained
it
if
it
should
have
really
come
from
lady
v
herself
i
must
still
approve
my
own
conduct
the
sum
circumstanced
as
she
now
is
was
certainly
too
much
for
to
bestow
or
to
receive
and
in
the
manner
of
my
refusal
i
think
i
have
insinuated
this
with
as
much
deference
for
lady
v
judgment
as
i
could
shew
she
will
see
my
motive
and
i
think
that
will
be
a
sort
of
whereby
i
shall
discover
from
her
behaviour
whether
my
doubts
are
well
grounded
or
patty
has
by
her
inquiries
heard
of
a
little
pleasant
retirement
in
the
country
about
fifty
miles
off
where
my
children
and
i
can
be
tolerably
lodged
and
boarded
for
thirty
pounds
a
year
at
the
house
of
an
honest
farmer
a
relation
of
hers
thither
i
shall
repair
as
soon
as
my
little
girls
are
in
a
condition
to
be
removed
by
the
dismal
task
is
fallen
upon
me
again
to
keep
an
account
of
our
melancholy
days
my
dear
suffering
lady
is
seized
with
a
fever
and
confined
to
her
bed
she
orders
me
madam
to
write
down
every
thing
as
it
happens
lord
keep
us
there
is
nothing
but
sorrows
in
this
world
i
am
sure
at
least
my
poor
lady
has
had
her
full
share
of
them
her
close
attendance
on
the
children
and
the
loss
of
rest
for
so
many
nights
has
brought
this
new
affliction
on
her
oh
madam
the
loss
of
health
is
a
grievous
thing
even
when
there
are
riches
what
must
it
be
in
my
lady
circumstances
but
she
has
the
patience
of
job
himself
to
be
sure
madam
her
trials
are
enough
to
put
another
beside
themselves
but
i
think
my
lady
courage
increases
with
her
troubles
i
was
obliged
with
an
aching
heart
to
dispose
of
a
fine
lace
head
of
my
lady
i
heard
her
say
it
cost
sixty
pounds
but
though
it
never
was
wet
but
once
i
got
but
fifteen
for
it
and
this
perhaps
may
all
go
to
the
doctor
if
my
lady
illness
continues
long
what
does
it
signify
we
can
not
buy
health
too
dear
my
lady
is
better
between
whiles
the
doctor
says
her
disorder
is
chiefly
on
her
spirits
and
though
it
is
not
dangerous
he
is
afraid
it
will
be
very
tedious
lord
what
will
become
of
us
if
it
is
my
lady
has
had
a
letter
this
day
from
lady
v
which
she
has
ordered
me
to
send
you
madam
a
copy
of
to
mrs
arnold
can
not
imagine
my
dear
mrs
arnold
how
uneasy
you
have
made
me
by
your
not
accepting
of
the
bill
i
sent
you
because
i
too
well
know
the
occasion
you
have
for
it
but
since
you
refused
and
i
know
the
sincerity
and
strength
of
your
resolutions
i
must
not
take
to
myself
the
merit
of
this
friendly
and
generous
offer
too
liberal
indeed
as
you
with
great
delicacy
hinted
for
to
make
to
let
you
into
the
secret
at
once
and
that
your
gratitude
may
be
directed
to
the
proper
place
it
was
from
our
noble
friend
mr
faulkland
that
i
received
that
sum
with
instructions
to
send
it
to
you
as
from
myself
for
he
well
knows
you
would
not
have
accepted
it
from
him
but
since
i
see
you
are
determined
to
reject
it
as
coming
even
from
me
i
think
i
ought
in
justice
to
him
to
place
this
act
of
friendship
to
the
right
account
had
a
letter
lately
from
mr
faulkland
wherein
he
tells
me
that
having
heard
from
your
correspondence
with
mrs
faulkland
of
lady
bidulph
death
he
fears
you
are
by
her
loss
rendered
extremely
unhappy
in
your
circumstances
he
is
not
a
stranger
to
the
losses
you
formerly
sustained
in
your
fortune
and
he
says
besides
he
knows
your
brother
warm
temper
so
well
that
he
is
apprehensive
he
will
carry
an
unreasonable
resentment
he
has
taken
up
so
far
as
to
deny
you
that
brotherly
kindness
and
assistance
which
you
have
a
right
to
expect
from
him
if
this
be
the
case
he
adds
what
must
be
mrs
arnold
situation
he
then
conjures
me
to
convey
to
you
that
trifle
as
he
called
it
under
the
sanction
of
my
own
name
that
being
the
only
one
from
which
he
had
a
hope
it
would
not
be
refused
and
he
farther
said
that
if
you
should
be
prevailed
upon
on
account
of
the
friendship
which
he
knew
there
was
between
you
and
me
to
accept
of
my
service
he
would
contrive
from
time
to
time
to
furnish
you
with
such
little
supplies
as
might
make
you
easy
sir
george
and
you
should
be
on
better
terms
now
my
dear
mrs
arnold
you
have
the
truth
of
this
whole
affair
i
own
it
was
with
great
reluctance
i
lent
my
name
to
impose
on
you
but
as
it
was
so
much
for
your
benefit
i
overcame
my
scruple
could
wish
your
extreme
nicety
had
not
forbid
you
to
accept
this
offer
i
have
reason
to
be
angry
with
you
on
this
account
yet
my
amiable
sagacious
friend
perhaps
you
had
your
doubts
be
that
as
it
will
remember
you
said
you
would
not
have
refused
a
small
token
of
my
love
i
wish
i
could
send
you
one
worthy
of
your
acceptance
and
the
love
i
bear
you
we
should
then
see
whose
punctilio
should
get
the
better
as
it
is
i
send
you
a
very
small
token
which
i
insist
on
your
taking
if
you
have
the
least
occasion
if
this
should
be
the
case
i
know
the
candour
of
your
heart
and
that
you
will
be
too
ingenuous
to
grieve
me
by
a
refusal
hope
mr
faulkland
will
not
be
angry
with
me
for
betraying
his
secret
but
what
would
it
now
avail
to
keep
it
i
would
have
as
well
as
myself
know
his
worth
oh
how
i
lament
but
it
is
to
no
purpose
adieu
my
dear
good
creature
you
are
tried
like
fine
gold
and
your
excellence
is
become
the
more
conspicuous
by
adversity
am
my
lady
spirits
were
greatly
affected
by
reading
this
letter
she
wept
bitterly
and
was
so
cast
down
all
day
i
was
afraid
it
would
make
her
disorder
much
worse
the
good
lady
v
inclosed
a
bill
of
fifty
pounds
in
it
my
lady
said
she
must
not
refuse
it
but
would
thank
her
ladyship
whenever
she
was
able
to
take
a
pen
in
her
hand
god
knows
when
that
will
be
for
though
she
struggles
with
her
illness
it
still
gets
the
mastery
the
two
young
misses
mend
but
slowly
they
do
not
gather
the
least
strength
and
one
of
them
has
such
a
weakness
in
her
eyes
that
she
can
not
bear
the
least
light
indeed
madam
this
is
a
most
melancholy
family
i
pray
to
god
night
and
day
to
keep
me
in
health
more
for
their
sakes
than
my
own
for
i
think
it
would
quite
break
my
heart
if
they
should
want
my
attendance
and
i
should
not
be
able
to
give
it
to
i
write
on
madam
as
i
am
ordered
though
i
have
but
little
to
say
in
the
confinement
of
a
dismal
sick
room
where
i
never
see
any
body
but
a
doctor
and
an
apothecary
but
my
lady
is
unwilling
to
let
this
packet
go
till
she
is
able
herself
to
tell
you
with
her
own
hand
that
she
is
better
for
fear
my
dull
account
should
make
you
uneasy
there
is
such
changes
and
turns
in
my
lady
disorder
that
we
do
not
know
what
to
make
of
it
one
while
we
think
she
is
a
little
better
and
then
again
the
next
hour
she
seems
much
worse
than
before
the
doctor
would
have
a
consultation
though
my
lady
is
quite
against
it
but
these
doctors
love
to
bring
in
one
another
my
lady
v
present
came
in
good
time
but
if
they
go
on
at
this
rate
it
will
not
last
long
my
lady
said
to
me
patty
one
would
think
that
i
was
of
great
consequence
and
mighty
happy
by
this
bustle
to
preserve
my
life
but
there
is
the
tie
pointing
to
the
two
children
for
their
sakes
i
must
try
to
get
well
after
an
interview
of
six
weeks
written
by
mrs
arnold
in
a
hand
scarce
legible
restored
at
length
by
the
mercy
of
god
from
the
jaws
of
death
restored
to
my
children
to
my
dear
cecilia
and
just
able
to
tell
her
with
a
feeble
hand
that
her
sidney
lives
i
am
now
able
my
dear
to
reassume
that
task
once
the
most
pleasing
of
my
life
when
health
joy
and
prosperity
gilded
all
my
days
the
scene
is
now
changed
and
i
think
i
have
nothing
the
same
about
me
but
the
feelings
and
affections
of
my
mind
you
can
not
imagine
my
cecilia
how
i
am
altered
you
would
not
now
say
that
you
envied
my
white
and
red
you
would
hardly
know
me
and
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
preyed
on
as
i
have
been
for
near
two
months
by
a
slow
but
tormenting
fever
it
is
with
difficulty
that
i
hold
my
pen
but
my
willing
hand
obeys
my
heart
when
it
would
pour
itself
out
to
thee
i
have
made
a
shift
to
scrawl
a
few
lines
to
my
good
lady
v
to
thank
her
for
her
kindness
i
could
not
refuse
it
it
would
indeed
have
been
disingenuous
considering
the
footing
on
which
she
put
my
acceptance
of
it
i
should
have
been
driven
to
extreme
streights
if
it
had
not
been
for
her
present
confined
as
long
as
i
have
been
to
the
languishing
bed
of
sickness
patty
heard
that
my
brother
has
been
in
town
some
time
but
he
takes
no
notice
of
me
i
have
not
a
relation
in
the
world
but
himself
he
could
not
sure
be
so
cruel
if
he
knew
all
but
lady
sarah
keeps
it
from
him
she
thinks
perhaps
i
am
slunk
into
some
obscure
corner
where
she
leaves
me
to
distress
sir
george
is
not
of
a
savage
nature
yet
his
humanity
is
not
strong
enough
to
seek
out
the
afflicted
his
pride
too
i
know
is
gratified
by
having
me
out
of
the
way
of
observation
and
so
long
as
i
do
not
call
upon
him
i
find
he
will
not
enquire
after
me
the
winter
is
now
so
far
advanced
and
i
am
in
a
condition
so
extremely
weak
that
i
can
not
till
the
spring
advances
a
little
think
of
taking
my
flight
to
my
peaceful
retreat
in
the
country
i
look
eagerly
forward
to
the
time
of
my
enlargement
such
i
may
call
it
for
indeed
my
dear
my
spirits
are
quite
exhausted
with
my
long
confinement
in
a
little
close
lodging
in
this
irksome
town
the
gentlewoman
with
whom
i
lodged
in
st
told
patty
who
went
to
her
house
to
enquire
if
there
were
any
letters
for
me
that
there
have
been
at
different
times
several
people
of
my
former
acquaintance
to
look
for
me
but
i
do
not
find
that
one
enquiry
has
come
from
my
brother
i
had
given
the
gentlewoman
instructions
not
to
tell
any
stranger
where
i
lodged
i
believe
this
caution
was
needless
there
are
few
who
give
themselves
the
trouble
to
trace
out
the
steps
of
the
unhappy
and
i
dare
say
that
those
whom
common
form
obliged
to
pay
me
a
visit
of
condolence
on
my
mother
death
were
none
of
them
much
hurt
at
the
disappointment
of
not
finding
i
have
been
laying
down
a
little
sort
of
plan
for
my
future
life
i
told
you
the
terms
i
could
live
upon
with
the
farmer
whom
patty
found
out
for
me
but
as
i
can
not
expect
to
be
boarded
at
so
cheap
a
rate
when
my
children
are
grown
bigger
i
have
been
devising
the
means
how
to
enlarge
my
scanty
income
against
the
time
that
our
wants
must
necessarily
increase
for
i
am
firmly
resolved
my
kind
lady
v
shall
never
augment
the
debt
i
already
owe
her
you
know
my
dear
i
am
pretty
dexterous
at
my
needle
the
woman
where
i
lodge
deals
in
embroidery
which
is
much
in
fashion
and
i
think
i
have
not
seen
any
though
she
pays
largely
to
her
artificers
in
this
way
equal
to
some
pieces
of
my
own
work
now
my
cecilia
i
have
resolved
to
apply
myself
to
this
when
i
get
into
the
country
i
shewed
the
woman
a
small
wrought
by
me
when
i
was
a
girl
the
same
which
i
remember
my
poor
mr
arnold
accused
me
of
neglecting
for
my
horace
and
which
had
never
been
made
up
she
said
the
work
was
so
curious
that
she
would
give
any
price
for
such
a
hand
patty
is
well
skilled
in
this
sort
of
work
too
and
as
i
find
she
is
determined
not
to
quit
me
i
must
in
return
endeavour
not
to
let
the
poor
girl
be
too
great
a
sufferer
for
her
kindness
i
think
we
shall
between
us
be
able
to
do
a
good
deal
and
my
landlady
has
promised
to
receive
and
dispose
of
our
work
for
a
small
consideration
as
fast
as
we
can
send
it
to
her
which
we
shall
have
constant
opportunities
of
doing
you
can
not
imagine
how
pleased
i
am
with
my
scheme
patty
is
in
raptures
at
the
thoughts
of
her
being
permitted
to
continue
with
me
i
would
even
now
set
about
my
project
if
my
health
would
allow
me
but
alas
my
cecilia
i
am
still
so
feeble
i
am
not
able
to
sit
up
more
than
an
hour
or
two
at
a
time
and
can
not
walk
my
narrow
room
without
help
fresh
air
and
a
little
gentle
exercise
would
i
am
sure
more
than
any
thing
contribute
to
restore
my
strength
but
the
means
to
procure
these
are
not
conveniently
within
my
power
so
that
i
must
wait
that
slow
but
generally
sure
remedy
patience
i
have
a
wonderful
incident
to
relate
to
you
you
my
cecilia
i
know
will
join
with
me
in
admiring
and
praising
god
for
his
gracious
providence
this
morning
i
was
but
just
risen
and
got
down
into
my
little
parlour
when
patty
came
to
tell
me
a
man
desired
to
speak
with
me
i
immediately
ordered
him
to
be
admitted
patty
accordingly
introduced
the
person
who
had
stood
in
the
entry
whilst
she
was
speaking
to
me
he
seemed
to
be
a
man
between
forty
and
fifty
years
old
mean
in
his
apparel
though
clean
i
nodded
to
my
maid
to
leave
the
room
which
when
she
had
done
i
civilly
demanded
of
the
stranger
his
business
i
was
standing
when
he
entered
the
room
and
continued
doing
so
while
i
spoke
to
him
not
thinking
from
his
appearance
that
he
was
intitled
to
sit
down
with
me
you
know
i
am
not
proud
but
there
is
a
sort
of
usage
established
which
we
naturally
fall
into
the
man
who
had
advanced
some
steps
into
the
room
looked
over
his
shoulder
as
if
for
a
chair
so
i
understood
the
motion
and
accordingly
sat
down
myself
and
bad
him
do
so
too
he
did
and
with
an
air
as
if
he
considered
the
civility
to
be
only
what
was
due
to
him
i
believe
madam
said
he
though
you
do
not
remember
me
that
you
can
not
be
ignorant
of
your
having
had
a
relation
of
the
name
of
warner
who
went
to
the
about
five
and
twenty
years
ago
i
answered
i
do
remember
to
have
heard
of
such
a
person
you
see
that
unfortunate
man
before
you
he
replied
i
am
your
near
relation
madam
your
father
was
my
mother
only
brother
i
have
been
very
unhappy
i
lost
in
my
return
to
england
what
almost
five
and
twenty
years
industry
had
scraped
together
the
sum
was
but
a
moderate
one
yet
sufficient
to
have
supported
me
decently
for
the
remainder
of
my
life
i
asked
him
how
it
happened
i
began
said
he
to
grow
sickly
abroad
and
was
told
that
my
native
air
might
restore
me
this
advice
so
well
agreed
with
my
own
inclinations
which
were
for
a
long
time
past
bent
upon
returning
home
that
i
took
the
first
opportunity
of
a
ship
bound
for
england
but
we
were
unluckily
met
by
a
french
privateer
who
stripped
me
of
every
thing
but
the
clothes
on
my
back
and
set
me
on
shore
on
the
coast
of
spain
whence
i
begged
my
passage
to
england
having
nothing
to
support
me
but
a
few
shillings
part
of
a
collection
made
for
me
and
my
amongst
some
english
gentlemen
whilst
he
spoke
i
thought
i
could
discover
a
likeness
in
his
face
to
my
father
he
was
reckoned
extremely
to
resemble
his
sister
the
mother
of
this
unhappy
mr
warner
she
was
a
fine
woman
and
i
had
seen
her
picture
his
story
was
credible
and
i
had
no
reason
to
doubt
the
truth
of
what
he
said
and
here
i
will
give
you
a
brief
account
of
what
occasioned
this
unfortunate
relation
to
be
thus
long
an
alien
from
his
family
his
mother
as
you
have
just
now
heard
was
my
father
sister
who
threw
her
person
and
her
fortune
away
upon
a
broken
officer
this
act
disobliged
my
father
so
much
that
from
the
time
of
her
marriage
to
the
hour
of
her
death
he
never
would
see
her
her
husband
died
when
this
their
only
child
was
about
nine
years
old
the
poor
mother
survived
him
but
a
short
time
and
the
orphan
boy
was
left
to
my
father
mercy
i
have
often
heard
him
say
he
was
very
unlucky
and
never
could
be
persuaded
into
a
love
of
his
book
he
was
however
put
to
school
and
my
father
bestowed
the
same
expence
on
his
education
as
if
he
had
been
his
own
son
when
he
was
about
sixteen
years
old
as
he
wrote
a
good
hand
and
had
a
great
capacity
for
figures
he
bound
him
apprentice
to
a
merchant
in
which
situation
he
had
been
above
a
year
and
during
that
time
he
had
made
several
elopements
and
was
with
difficulty
reconciled
to
his
master
through
my
father
mediation
when
he
committed
such
a
misdemeanour
in
his
master
family
as
obliged
him
to
abscond
accordingly
he
stole
unknown
to
any
body
on
board
a
ship
bound
to
the
of
which
his
master
was
partly
owner
where
he
hid
himself
and
nobody
could
tell
what
was
become
of
him
my
father
about
nine
months
after
his
departure
received
a
letter
from
him
dated
from
jamaica
wherein
he
begged
pardon
of
him
and
his
master
for
his
elopement
told
him
that
he
had
been
taken
into
a
merchant
compting
house
and
declared
that
he
meant
by
his
diligence
and
good
behaviour
to
make
amends
for
his
past
ill
conduct
this
was
the
only
letter
my
father
or
any
of
his
friends
ever
had
from
him
he
answered
it
but
had
no
return
nor
could
he
from
repeated
enquiries
made
two
or
three
years
after
learn
any
thing
of
him
so
that
all
his
relations
concluded
him
dead
these
particulars
i
had
heard
before
from
my
father
and
his
relations
perfectly
agreeing
with
them
in
every
circumstance
i
could
have
no
doubt
but
that
he
was
the
man
sir
said
i
i
very
well
remember
to
have
heard
your
story
your
likeness
to
my
father
who
was
the
image
of
your
mother
leaves
me
no
room
to
question
your
being
the
mr
warner
of
whom
i
have
so
often
heard
you
are
indeed
my
near
relation
and
it
grieves
my
heart
to
see
you
in
such
distress
and
the
more
so
as
i
have
not
the
ability
i
could
wish
to
assist
you
but
we
will
talk
over
more
particulars
after
breakfast
i
rang
the
bell
and
ordered
patty
to
get
some
coffee
while
we
were
at
breakfast
i
asked
my
kinsman
by
what
means
he
had
discovered
me
so
soon
for
by
the
way
i
should
have
told
you
that
he
said
he
had
been
arrived
but
two
days
in
london
he
answered
that
one
of
the
english
gentlemen
who
had
been
so
kind
to
him
at
cadiz
had
given
him
a
letter
to
a
gentleman
in
london
for
whom
he
was
to
leave
it
at
a
in
that
as
he
was
delivering
it
he
perceived
another
letter
lying
on
the
bar
directed
to
sir
george
bidulph
the
two
names
struck
him
remembering
them
to
be
those
of
his
cousin
his
uncle
he
supposed
was
dead
but
he
determined
to
enquire
who
that
gentleman
was
and
if
he
found
it
to
be
my
brother
to
apply
to
him
for
assistance
he
had
soon
an
opportunity
of
being
satisfied
my
brother
happened
to
come
in
his
chariot
to
the
door
just
as
mr
warner
was
going
out
he
knew
the
arms
and
had
some
recollection
even
of
his
features
it
was
past
three
and
i
heard
sir
george
direct
his
servant
home
i
concluded
he
was
going
to
dinner
and
that
the
morning
was
the
properest
time
to
call
on
him
and
having
informed
myself
where
he
lived
i
accordingly
went
yesterday
morning
he
stopped
and
sipped
his
coffee
for
some
time
without
speaking
and
did
you
see
him
sir
yes
madam
i
saw
him
and
heard
him
too
he
has
got
a
fine
house
and
seems
to
have
every
thing
very
elegant
about
him
when
i
was
let
into
the
hall
i
desired
the
footman
to
acquaint
his
master
that
a
gentleman
newly
arrived
from
the
wanted
to
speak
with
him
being
commissioned
by
mr
warner
a
relation
of
his
to
enquire
after
him
the
footman
went
up
stairs
and
returning
presently
asked
me
if
i
brought
a
letter
from
the
gentleman
i
mentioned
i
said
no
but
i
had
something
to
say
to
him
the
servant
after
delivering
this
message
came
halfway
down
the
first
flight
of
the
stairs
and
leaning
over
the
banisters
he
bid
me
walk
up
i
found
your
brother
and
his
lady
i
suppose
in
her
at
breakfast
there
was
tea
and
chocolate
on
the
table
i
bowed
very
respectfully
the
lady
scarce
moved
her
head
your
brother
said
your
servant
sir
and
viewed
me
from
head
to
foot
but
fixed
his
eyes
earnestly
on
my
face
the
footman
who
had
introduced
me
had
withdrawn
sir
said
i
have
you
quite
forgot
me
i
remember
you
well
he
answered
hesitatingly
and
with
a
change
of
countenance
that
boded
me
no
good
i
protest
sir
i
i
know
nothing
of
you
you
forgot
your
cousin
ned
warner
he
looked
at
his
wife
and
she
at
him
he
forced
a
smile
at
her
which
she
returned
without
knowing
for
what
do
remember
there
was
such
a
one
related
to
the
family
whom
we
all
supposed
to
be
dead
as
for
recollecting
his
person
is
really
so
long
ago
that
i
say
i
do
all
this
while
he
let
me
stand
he
was
lolling
in
an
easy
chair
and
had
a
dish
of
chocolate
in
his
hand
of
which
he
sipped
and
spoke
to
me
by
turns
his
wife
was
feeding
a
monkey
that
was
perched
on
her
shoulder
i
am
indeed
more
altered
than
you
sir
george
the
hardships
which
i
have
undergone
and
my
long
residence
in
a
warmer
climate
may
readily
account
for
that
but
have
you
no
traces
of
my
features
no
recollection
of
my
voice
i
have
carried
you
many
times
in
my
arms
i
do
not
dispute
the
of
your
person
but
i
should
be
glad
to
know
your
commands
with
me
i
have
none
sir
the
poor
must
entreat
not
command
i
then
proceeded
to
tell
him
my
unhappy
story
in
the
same
words
i
just
now
gave
it
to
you
his
lady
seemed
not
to
mind
me
but
kept
talking
to
her
marmouset
he
listened
to
me
but
with
so
much
impatience
in
his
looks
as
quite
abashed
me
i
was
still
standing
but
a
little
to
take
off
the
aukwardnes
of
my
posture
i
had
ventured
to
rest
one
arm
on
the
back
of
a
chair
when
i
had
done
speaking
your
brother
got
up
in
a
violent
passion
to
which
he
seemed
to
have
been
working
himself
up
during
the
time
i
took
to
explain
myself
he
whisked
away
the
chair
on
which
i
was
leaning
and
walked
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
then
turning
to
his
lady
is
not
this
a
pretty
fellow
to
force
his
way
in
upon
us
by
a
sham
story
of
a
message
from
a
relation
and
now
truly
by
way
of
an
agreeable
surprize
he
turns
out
to
be
that
very
relation
come
a
begging
in
his
own
proper
person
sir
said
i
i
ask
your
pardon
for
the
liberty
i
took
to
gain
admittance
to
you
but
you
will
be
the
more
inclined
to
excuse
me
if
you
please
to
consider
that
it
was
out
of
respect
to
you
that
i
would
not
in
the
mean
appearance
i
now
make
acknowledge
myself
to
any
of
your
servants
for
the
same
reason
i
imagined
that
had
i
not
sent
a
message
which
i
was
in
hopes
would
have
a
little
interested
you
in
my
favour
i
might
have
been
ordered
to
send
up
my
business
by
your
footman
which
would
i
thought
have
been
quite
improper
you
might
have
writ
said
he
interrupting
me
ah
sir
shaking
my
head
if
i
and
i
stopped
short
might
not
have
been
much
the
better
for
it
is
that
what
you
would
say
with
a
contemptuous
half
sneer
in
short
sir
i
can
do
nothing
for
you
what
is
it
that
you
expect
i
do
i
do
not
mean
to
be
a
burden
on
you
sir
i
replied
i
was
bred
to
business
i
write
a
good
hand
and
understand
accompts
i
hope
to
get
into
some
merchant
house
but
in
the
mean
time
i
am
starving
i
am
an
utter
stranger
here
though
in
my
own
country
i
observed
he
had
slipped
his
hands
into
his
breeches
pocket
and
seemed
to
be
feeling
for
a
bit
of
money
sir
george
said
the
lady
who
had
observed
him
as
well
as
i
to
no
purpose
to
give
any
thing
to
these
sort
of
people
assist
one
and
they
will
send
another
to
you
and
so
there
is
no
end
to
such
claims
your
brother
withdrew
his
hand
from
his
pocket
as
if
checked
by
his
lady
looks
it
is
not
in
my
power
to
assist
you
i
then
asked
him
if
you
were
living
and
where
i
could
find
you
for
though
you
were
not
born
when
i
left
england
i
heard
afterwards
that
sir
robert
bidulph
had
a
daughter
your
brother
replied
peevishly
he
knew
nothing
of
you
as
you
preferred
the
friendship
of
strangers
to
that
of
your
relations
he
then
rang
the
bell
and
calling
his
man
to
dress
him
went
out
of
the
room
without
casting
a
look
at
me
i
ventured
to
ask
his
lady
your
name
if
you
had
changed
it
and
where
you
lived
she
told
me
your
name
but
said
she
knew
not
where
you
lodged
adding
i
might
spare
myself
the
trouble
of
enquiring
you
out
for
to
her
knowlege
you
could
do
nothing
for
me
i
took
my
leave
but
enquiring
of
a
footman
whom
i
found
in
the
hall
he
directed
me
to
st
alban
street
where
you
formerly
lodged
i
went
there
and
it
was
with
difficulty
that
i
could
prevail
on
the
woman
of
the
house
to
tell
me
where
you
now
lived
but
my
necessities
made
me
urgent
and
i
waited
on
you
this
morning
madam
to
make
my
distress
known
to
you
but
i
am
afraid
the
information
i
had
from
your
concerning
you
has
but
too
much
truth
in
it
as
he
spoke
this
he
cast
his
eyes
round
my
meanly
furnished
parlour
looked
at
the
poor
equipage
of
my
tea
table
and
again
sipped
his
unfinished
and
now
cold
dish
of
coffee
sir
said
i
when
my
sister
informed
you
that
i
was
poor
it
is
certain
she
spoke
truth
i
am
not
however
i
thank
god
poor
but
that
i
can
spare
you
a
little
if
you
will
take
a
cheap
lodging
near
me
i
will
supply
you
with
enough
to
pay
for
it
and
if
you
can
eat
as
i
and
my
little
family
do
you
shall
be
welcome
to
us
every
day
till
something
can
be
done
for
you
i
see
but
very
few
people
but
i
will
speak
to
such
as
come
in
my
way
to
try
to
have
you
recommended
to
some
one
for
employment
i
then
put
my
hand
in
my
pocket
and
taking
out
five
shillings
all
the
silver
i
had
i
put
it
into
his
hand
sir
you
may
owe
some
little
trifle
where
you
have
slept
these
two
nights
i
fear
your
lodging
has
been
but
poor
but
if
this
will
not
discharge
it
tell
me
freely
he
suffered
me
to
drop
the
shillings
into
his
unclosed
hand
he
fixed
his
eyes
eagerly
on
my
face
but
instead
of
replying
to
what
i
said
he
only
cried
out
good
god
good
god
and
undoing
two
or
three
buttons
at
his
breast
he
sobbed
as
if
his
bosom
was
bursting
i
was
affected
with
his
gratitude
and
tried
to
disperse
the
tears
that
mounted
to
my
eyes
i
wish
i
could
weep
said
he
but
i
ca
and
may
these
be
the
last
tears
that
ever
you
shall
have
occasion
to
shed
my
worthy
my
generous
my
pious
relation
god
forgive
me
for
trying
such
a
heart
but
i
will
reward
it
amply
will
i
reward
your
goodness
he
then
drew
a
red
out
of
his
bosom
and
opening
it
he
put
a
bill
into
my
hand
for
two
thousand
pounds
on
the
bank
of
england
think
my
dear
how
i
started
at
such
a
vision
sir
you
amaze
me
was
all
i
could
say
i
beg
your
pardon
for
deceiving
you
said
he
but
it
was
with
a
good
intent
i
suppose
it
is
needless
to
tell
you
that
i
am
not
that
poor
forlorn
wretch
that
i
represented
myself
to
you
hear
the
real
truth
of
my
circumstances
you
see
before
you
of
a
private
man
one
of
the
richest
subjects
in
these
dominions
you
have
heard
that
my
was
no
other
than
that
of
a
common
in
a
merchant
at
jamaica
from
whence
i
wrote
twice
to
your
father
but
never
had
any
answer
i
interrupted
him
to
tell
him
i
had
heard
my
father
say
he
had
got
one
letter
from
him
and
had
writ
to
him
in
return
and
afterwards
made
many
enquiries
after
him
without
success
perhaps
he
might
said
he
but
i
never
received
it
nor
heard
of
any
enquiries
made
which
piqued
me
so
that
i
resolved
never
to
write
again
in
a
little
time
i
made
myself
so
useful
to
my
master
that
he
grew
exceedingly
fond
of
me
and
having
no
heir
but
an
only
daughter
who
it
seems
had
conceived
an
inclination
for
me
though
without
my
suspecting
it
but
which
her
father
had
by
some
means
discovered
he
frankly
made
an
offer
of
her
to
me
in
marriage
with
an
assurance
of
leaving
me
all
that
he
was
worth
at
his
decease
and
an
immediate
proffer
of
entering
into
partnership
with
him
the
only
return
he
required
on
my
part
was
to
change
my
name
and
assume
his
which
was
collett
i
made
no
scruple
of
complying
for
though
my
regard
to
the
young
lady
had
never
risen
to
what
is
commonly
called
love
i
yet
thought
her
in
all
respects
an
unexceptionable
match
i
married
her
my
patron
punctually
fulfilled
his
promise
and
at
the
end
of
three
years
i
found
myself
by
his
death
in
possession
of
a
considerable
estate
the
following
year
i
lost
my
wife
in
childbed
of
her
first
child
who
died
with
its
mother
the
changing
my
name
was
probably
the
occasion
of
my
not
being
found
out
by
those
employed
to
enquire
after
me
and
i
perhaps
ought
now
to
acknowlege
myself
careless
in
not
acquainting
my
friends
with
my
good
fortune
i
had
such
uncommon
success
in
trade
that
my
wealth
increased
amazingly
in
about
five
years
after
the
decease
of
my
first
wife
i
married
the
widow
of
a
merchant
with
whom
i
got
an
immense
fortune
this
lady
i
truly
loved
she
was
an
amiable
creature
i
had
one
son
by
her
a
fine
youth
and
we
lived
happily
together
for
twelve
years
at
the
end
of
which
it
pleased
god
to
take
from
me
both
wife
and
child
poor
man
his
tears
began
to
flow
here
he
proceeded
after
this
loss
my
own
life
began
to
grow
tiresome
to
me
i
had
more
riches
than
i
knew
what
to
do
with
and
had
nobody
to
leave
them
to
my
health
began
to
decline
i
grew
weary
of
the
place
and
resolved
partly
to
divert
my
melancholy
and
partly
through
affection
to
my
native
country
to
see
england
once
more
i
settled
my
affairs
in
the
best
manner
sent
considerable
sums
of
money
over
before
me
and
brought
a
large
one
with
me
during
my
voyage
the
whim
took
me
that
i
would
enquire
privately
after
your
family
and
present
myself
to
you
as
i
have
done
in
order
to
make
trial
of
your
dispositions
resolving
according
as
i
found
you
worthy
of
it
to
share
my
fortune
amongst
you
as
i
knew
i
had
no
other
relations
in
the
world
i
have
been
in
england
above
a
month
the
first
thing
i
did
was
to
go
down
into
wiltshire
where
i
was
soon
informed
that
your
father
and
mother
were
dead
and
that
your
brother
was
married
and
resided
for
the
most
part
in
london
you
i
was
told
had
been
married
and
was
a
widow
but
i
could
learn
no
more
about
you
on
my
return
to
town
i
soon
found
where
your
brother
lived
and
had
the
pleasure
to
hear
a
good
character
of
him
but
i
had
determined
to
make
my
own
experiment
on
him
and
i
did
intend
had
he
received
me
ever
so
kindly
to
have
made
the
same
experiment
on
you
before
i
disclosed
my
plot
to
either
of
you
i
dressed
myself
in
these
old
clothes
on
purpose
and
what
the
success
of
my
scheme
has
been
you
know
your
brother
narrow
hearted
inhuman
wretch
i
blot
forever
from
my
thoughts
it
will
be
the
better
for
you
though
i
have
more
than
enough
for
you
both
your
kindness
i
tell
you
again
my
valuable
relation
i
will
repay
an
accept
of
that
bill
in
your
hand
for
your
present
use
i
am
sure
you
want
it
and
accept
of
it
only
as
an
earnest
of
my
future
friendship
towards
you
that
brother
in
affluence
himself
who
could
see
his
sister
a
sister
want
must
have
lost
all
regard
to
ties
of
blood
and
is
no
wonder
that
i
so
much
further
removed
in
kindred
met
with
such
treatment
at
his
hands
see
my
cecilia
what
an
amazing
turn
of
fortune
what
could
i
do
but
lift
up
my
eyes
as
i
did
my
heart
in
silent
adoration
of
that
god
who
is
a
father
to
the
fatherless
and
defendeth
the
cause
of
the
widow
it
was
some
time
before
i
could
frame
my
mind
to
discourse
on
ordinary
subjects
i
gratefully
accepted
my
cousin
noble
present
he
enquired
minutely
into
my
situation
there
was
no
need
of
concealing
any
thing
from
him
nor
did
i
attempt
it
he
was
very
inquisitive
as
to
my
brother
behaviour
towards
me
i
told
him
the
whole
of
it
he
was
even
bitter
in
his
invectives
against
him
and
lady
sarah
but
said
he
i
will
have
my
revenge
on
them
i
will
make
you
triumph
over
him
and
that
proud
upstart
his
wife
what
lodgings
you
are
in
my
poor
dear
creature
is
this
your
best
room
i
told
him
i
had
nothing
but
that
and
a
where
the
children
and
i
lay
and
a
closet
for
my
maid
he
desired
to
see
the
children
and
i
had
them
both
brought
it
he
kissed
them
tenderly
poor
babes
you
have
a
cursed
uncle
but
you
have
a
very
good
mamma
and
i
will
take
care
of
you
all
i
will
dine
with
you
said
he
let
us
eat
a
comfortable
morsel
together
and
for
your
life
not
a
word
of
what
has
past
to
any
body
he
then
took
an
affectionate
leave
of
me
and
let
me
here
lay
down
my
pen
and
wonder
at
my
fate
i
have
got
into
a
flow
of
spirits
my
dear
what
scenes
of
happiness
might
now
open
upon
me
if
happiness
consisted
in
riches
alone
but
no
no
it
does
not
my
heart
broken
by
vexation
can
not
recover
its
tranquillity
so
soon
yet
is
there
room
for
joy
joy
springing
from
a
rational
from
a
humane
from
a
commendable
motive
and
i
will
a
little
indulge
it
i
can
now
in
part
return
the
vast
obligation
i
owe
mr
faulkland
as
far
as
at
least
relates
to
pecuniary
debts
i
can
now
repay
the
kindness
of
my
good
lady
v
i
can
provide
for
my
affectionate
worthy
patty
i
have
the
delightful
prospect
of
giving
my
children
an
education
suitable
to
their
birth
and
if
my
life
is
prolonged
of
seeing
them
honourably
and
happily
settled
in
the
world
i
shall
have
the
glorious
power
of
diffusing
benefits
oh
my
dear
is
good
for
me
that
i
have
been
in
trouble
it
has
so
enlarged
my
charity
that
i
feel
transports
which
prosperity
is
a
stranger
to
at
the
bare
idea
of
having
it
in
my
power
to
succour
the
afflicted
who
would
not
suffer
adversity
to
have
the
heart
so
improved
my
relation
dined
with
me
according
to
promise
patty
had
provided
two
dishes
of
the
best
things
in
season
and
dressed
them
admirably
i
need
not
tell
you
in
what
satisfaction
mr
warner
and
i
enjoyed
our
little
chearful
meal
he
had
sent
me
in
the
morning
a
hamper
of
excellent
wine
and
seemed
to
relish
his
bottle
with
an
extraordinary
good
goust
when
patty
had
carried
the
children
up
stairs
and
we
were
left
alone
he
told
me
that
he
had
been
that
morning
looking
out
a
house
for
me
you
must
quit
these
lodgings
directly
and
submit
a
little
to
my
management
for
i
mortify
your
paltry
brother
and
his
wife
you
shall
have
as
handsome
a
house
as
his
and
better
furnished
too
or
i
know
why
you
must
know
i
mean
to
set
you
out
like
a
dutchess
and
you
shall
roll
by
that
worthless
puppy
door
in
a
better
equipage
than
his
minx
is
carried
in
but
i
do
not
intend
to
live
with
you
as
well
as
i
love
you
for
though
i
am
an
old
fellow
you
are
young
and
handsome
and
the
world
i
know
is
full
of
scandal
i
shall
therefore
content
myself
with
a
lodging
some
where
in
your
neighbourhood
and
come
and
see
you
now
and
then
i
thanked
him
for
the
prudence
of
his
consideration
but
begged
he
would
restrain
his
generosity
and
suffer
me
to
live
in
that
moderate
state
which
if
i
had
ever
so
much
riches
would
be
my
choice
do
oppose
me
coz
said
he
pray
do
i
have
my
way
in
this
i
have
set
my
heart
upon
it
you
shall
for
a
while
at
least
when
i
have
had
my
revenge
you
may
live
as
you
please
afterwards
i
was
unwilling
to
contradict
him
in
his
odd
humour
yet
was
very
much
afraid
of
the
consequences
of
as
he
called
it
all
at
once
but
dear
sir
said
i
what
will
the
world
think
of
my
emerging
thus
from
obscurity
into
the
splendour
you
talk
of
though
you
do
not
live
with
me
as
i
am
still
young
may
it
not
give
room
for
censure
busy
people
will
pry
into
the
source
from
whence
i
draw
my
affluence
and
envy
will
not
be
backward
in
putting
wrong
constructions
on
an
appearance
by
which
it
will
be
so
much
excited
he
listened
looking
at
me
earnestly
in
the
face
then
nodding
his
head
with
a
very
grave
countenance
said
you
are
a
sensible
woman
coz
and
i
commend
your
prudence
but
i
must
have
my
will
for
all
that
i
could
not
forbear
smiling
at
his
manner
and
going
on
if
said
i
i
were
to
enter
again
into
public
life
with
a
moderately
genteel
appearance
only
nobody
curiosity
would
be
excited
as
it
might
easily
be
supposed
that
my
brother
had
enabled
me
to
support
a
decent
figure
in
the
i
soon
found
that
i
had
made
use
of
a
wrong
argument
which
put
my
friend
into
a
violent
passion
a
for
you
and
your
brother
too
said
he
do
you
think
i
will
let
that
whelp
have
the
credit
of
what
mean
to
do
for
you
no
no
set
your
heart
at
rest
about
that
what
i
do
all
the
world
shall
know
and
my
reasons
for
it
too
i
have
my
own
way
there
is
no
hurt
i
hope
in
providing
for
a
near
kinswoman
that
is
left
to
starve
by
a
still
nearer
relation
i
make
you
my
heir
look
you
and
i
will
spread
it
all
over
the
town
is
there
any
harm
in
that
god
knows
i
have
no
more
ill
in
my
heart
than
one
of
your
children
but
i
am
a
little
resenting
may
be
so
say
no
more
of
it
i
found
mr
warner
was
pretty
positive
therefore
thought
it
the
wisest
way
to
insist
no
farther
upon
the
argument
but
told
him
i
would
submit
intirely
to
his
discretion
it
will
be
best
for
you
said
he
consider
me
as
your
father
and
i
will
a
father
to
you
he
then
told
me
that
he
had
been
trying
to
get
a
house
for
me
near
my
brother
that
i
might
him
as
he
called
it
but
that
as
there
were
none
empty
in
the
square
he
had
fixed
on
a
very
handsome
one
in
an
adjoining
street
i
did
not
like
the
furniture
said
he
so
i
ordered
it
out
and
have
bespoke
new
of
an
upholder
who
promises
me
in
a
week
or
ten
days
at
farthest
to
have
every
thing
completely
fitted
up
in
the
mean
time
i
ca
bear
to
see
you
in
this
sorry
room
poor
soul
how
long
have
you
been
here
i
told
him
near
four
months
and
that
with
his
permission
i
would
continue
in
these
lodgings
till
the
house
was
ready
as
it
was
not
worth
while
to
change
them
for
so
short
a
time
well
said
he
you
may
do
as
you
will
for
that
i
see
that
every
thing
is
to
your
satisfaction
he
took
his
leave
with
an
affectionate
shake
by
the
hand
how
miraculous
is
all
this
my
dear
this
messenger
of
good
tidings
is
he
not
sent
to
me
by
providence
as
i
found
he
intended
not
to
make
a
secret
of
his
designs
in
my
favour
i
was
in
haste
to
divulge
the
joyful
news
to
my
friends
i
have
accordingly
writ
to
my
lady
v
giving
her
an
account
of
the
wonderful
revolution
in
my
affairs
and
i
intend
as
soon
as
i
can
fix
upon
some
curious
present
worth
her
acceptance
to
make
her
a
large
return
for
her
favours
i
have
also
acquainted
mrs
faulkland
of
the
happy
turn
in
my
fortune
and
i
design
a
magnificent
present
for
her
as
soon
as
i
have
time
to
prepare
it
to
neither
of
these
ladies
have
i
hinted
at
my
brother
behaviour
either
to
myself
or
mr
warner
i
have
made
the
good
woman
with
whom
i
lodge
stare
wonderfully
at
the
relation
i
could
get
nothing
from
her
but
exclamations
of
astonishment
her
hands
and
eyes
lifted
up
god
lord
bless
us
what
strange
things
come
about
what
luck
people
are
born
to
and
this
was
your
cousin
that
you
never
set
eyes
on
before
my
goodness
what
a
swarthy
gentleman
he
is
but
tumbling
in
gold
i
warrant
him
it
would
be
long
before
such
good
fortune
would
happen
to
me
though
i
have
a
cousin
beyond
seas
too
i
could
plainly
see
that
this
poor
woman
envied
my
prosperity
though
she
tried
to
congratulate
me
but
it
is
the
less
to
be
wondered
at
as
she
knew
not
that
i
was
born
to
any
better
prospect
than
that
of
working
for
my
bread
in
a
two
pair
of
stairs
room
i
have
not
seen
my
honest
kinsman
these
four
days
but
he
sent
me
a
note
to
inform
me
that
he
was
busy
in
seeing
every
thing
put
in
order
in
my
new
house
and
that
he
abstained
from
visiting
me
out
of
this
word
he
marked
the
more
to
impress
his
full
meaning
he
says
i
shall
not
see
any
thing
till
all
is
ready
neither
has
he
yet
so
much
as
told
me
the
street
where
i
am
to
live
i
find
he
as
he
himself
says
have
his
own
way
now
my
cecilia
i
may
reasonably
hope
that
my
afflictions
are
at
an
end
as
far
as
wealth
can
promote
felicity
that
felicity
is
mine
i
have
just
settled
with
my
landlady
and
having
paid
her
for
her
lodgings
made
her
a
present
a
little
to
reconcile
her
to
my
prosperity
when
a
new
chariot
most
superbly
gilt
stopped
at
my
door
a
black
and
a
white
footman
in
rich
laced
liveries
behind
it
one
of
these
brought
me
a
note
from
mr
warner
who
informed
me
that
he
had
sent
my
equipage
to
carry
me
home
where
i
should
find
him
waiting
to
welcome
me
to
my
house
patty
seemed
to
have
got
wings
to
her
feet
she
flew
up
to
me
with
the
welcome
notice
and
begged
of
me
to
observe
from
the
window
that
the
servants
were
in
our
own
family
livery
with
this
difference
that
the
lace
was
silver
instead
of
what
we
used
to
give
on
expressing
my
surprise
at
this
patty
told
me
that
mr
warner
had
at
his
second
visit
enquired
of
her
as
she
let
him
out
what
liveries
we
used
to
give
but
bid
her
not
mention
it
to
me
which
she
said
she
would
not
do
as
she
guessed
he
meant
to
surprise
me
but
this
was
not
all
he
had
been
so
minutely
correct
as
to
have
the
arnold
arms
in
a
lozenge
elegantly
painted
on
the
doors
what
these
were
he
was
at
the
pains
of
informing
himself
elsewhere
my
patty
almost
frantick
with
joy
hurried
the
two
children
down
stairs
and
stuck
them
up
in
the
chariot
telling
them
both
it
was
their
own
as
she
put
them
into
it
but
the
poor
babes
fell
a
crying
and
were
not
to
be
pacified
by
the
novelty
or
finery
of
the
thing
till
i
came
to
them
she
staid
behind
to
send
our
little
baggage
after
us
and
i
drove
to
my
new
house
in
where
i
found
my
generous
benefactor
waiting
as
he
had
promised
to
receive
me
oh
my
dear
he
is
a
princely
man
such
grandeur
such
elegance
he
led
me
thro
every
room
where
wealth
and
magnificence
were
displayed
even
to
profusion
from
top
to
bottom
there
is
not
the
smallest
article
wanting
that
luxury
itself
can
imagine
the
carpets
skreens
cabinets
and
an
abundance
of
fine
china
are
beyond
comparison
more
beautiful
than
any
thing
of
the
kind
i
have
ever
seen
is
but
eleven
days
since
my
kinsman
mentioned
his
design
to
me
and
you
must
believe
he
has
been
indefatigable
in
his
diligence
since
he
has
left
nothing
for
me
to
do
but
at
once
to
take
possession
of
this
splendid
mansion
all
the
necessary
domesticks
are
hired
and
ready
in
their
respective
stations
and
i
am
already
as
much
settled
in
a
few
hours
as
if
i
had
lived
here
so
many
years
mr
warner
told
me
that
as
a
trifle
would
not
be
sufficient
to
keep
up
every
thing
in
proportionable
state
about
me
he
intended
to
allow
me
three
thousand
pounds
a
year
this
appointment
said
he
you
are
to
consider
as
your
own
property
and
just
call
upon
me
as
you
would
on
your
steward
i
am
sure
you
will
employ
it
well
you
gave
me
a
proof
of
that
in
five
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
being
too
profuse
in
your
charities
when
i
die
you
will
find
yourself
possessed
of
the
means
of
continuing
them
dear
sir
said
i
long
may
you
live
to
feel
and
rejoice
in
the
blessings
which
bounty
will
through
me
i
hope
draw
down
on
us
both
i
leave
you
to
enjoy
yourself
said
he
but
i
am
impatient
till
your
brother
knows
what
he
has
lost
by
his
he
can
not
long
be
ignorant
of
it
sir
replied
i
but
indeed
i
flatter
myself
that
he
is
not
quite
so
much
to
blame
in
regard
to
me
as
we
have
both
imagined
you
see
he
seemed
to
know
nothing
of
my
situation
when
you
enquired
after
me
and
even
threw
out
something
like
a
reproach
for
my
having
withdrawn
myself
without
acquainting
him
where
i
was
i
am
very
sure
lady
sarah
never
informed
him
of
my
having
applied
to
it
was
his
duty
to
have
enquired
you
out
said
he
did
he
not
know
you
were
poor
he
knew
said
i
that
my
circumstances
were
very
much
streighten
but
he
did
not
know
much
well
well
answered
mr
warner
it
is
good
in
you
to
excuse
him
but
know
him
to
be
a
poltroon
he
took
his
leave
and
said
he
would
see
me
soon
again
having
taken
lodgings
for
himself
in
my
neighbourhood
i
begin
to
doubt
my
cecilia
whether
i
am
really
awake
or
not
is
all
enchantment
i
am
afraid
my
old
kinsman
is
a
wizard
i
have
been
talking
to
and
examining
my
servants
to
see
if
they
are
real
living
people
or
only
phantoms
i
look
at
and
handle
the
rich
furniture
of
my
apartments
to
try
if
it
be
substantial
is
all
so
every
thing
real
i
beg
my
cousin
pardon
for
suspecting
him
of
sorcery
i
believe
he
deals
in
no
charms
but
that
one
money
now
my
sister
what
a
spacious
field
is
there
opened
before
me
three
thousand
pounds
a
year
how
many
hearts
will
it
be
in
my
power
to
make
glad
and
i
will
make
many
glad
lord
god
who
hast
showered
down
thy
blessings
in
abundance
on
my
head
vouchsafe
me
such
a
portion
of
thy
grace
that
i
may
become
an
humble
instrument
of
thy
mercy
to
those
whom
the
rod
of
adversity
has
laid
in
the
dust
teach
me
so
to
use
this
thy
bounteous
favour
that
honour
not
worldly
desires
may
be
promoted
that
praise
not
pride
may
be
exalted
and
if
o
lord
thou
hast
chosen
me
to
be
the
dispenser
of
thy
fatherly
kindness
to
the
afflicted
that
cry
unto
thee
quicken
in
my
heart
such
diligence
humility
and
integrity
as
may
render
me
not
unworthy
of
the
important
trust
but
if
o
my
god
thou
has
sent
riches
only
to
be
a
trial
of
my
strength
unsupported
by
thee
be
merciful
take
them
from
me
and
restore
to
me
that
poverty
which
first
taught
me
to
know
myself
upon
my
knees
i
have
poured
out
this
prayer
to
the
almighty
and
it
is
the
fervent
wish
of
my
soul
that
he
would
grant
it
you
will
smile
my
dear
as
i
did
in
pity
of
the
meanness
of
poor
lady
sarah
but
proud
people
are
always
mean
i
have
been
here
but
four
days
yet
i
find
she
has
already
heard
of
my
metamorphosis
indeed
she
could
hardly
do
otherwise
so
near
her
as
i
am
mr
warner
has
been
very
urgent
with
me
to
drive
out
in
my
new
chariot
this
i
readily
complied
with
as
both
the
children
and
i
wanted
air
and
exercise
and
yesterday
we
drove
to
i
did
not
however
go
at
the
hour
when
there
is
most
company
but
i
conclude
i
was
seen
either
by
lady
sarah
herself
or
by
some
one
who
told
her
for
this
morning
prodigious
she
sent
her
woman
to
me
with
a
message
i
had
her
called
up
stairs
and
enquired
very
civilly
after
my
brother
and
his
lady
she
told
me
that
lady
sarah
sent
her
humble
service
to
me
and
was
very
much
surprised
that
she
had
not
heard
from
me
in
so
long
a
time
that
she
supposed
i
was
gone
out
of
town
but
as
sir
george
seemed
uneasy
that
i
never
wrote
to
him
her
ladyship
had
sent
her
to
enquire
for
me
at
my
old
lodgings
in
the
from
whence
she
had
been
directed
to
me
here
and
that
she
was
ordered
to
tell
me
that
her
lady
had
talked
to
my
brother
about
the
affair
that
i
knew
of
and
that
sir
george
would
act
agreeably
to
her
request
if
i
would
call
or
write
a
line
to
him
i
found
the
woman
had
been
instructed
to
feign
an
entire
ignorance
on
her
lady
part
of
the
change
in
my
circumstances
but
i
was
resolved
to
let
her
see
i
had
detected
this
paltry
artifice
i
could
observe
that
the
servant
though
she
endeavoured
to
avoid
it
eyed
every
thing
in
my
apartment
with
surprise
and
curiosity
and
i
concluded
that
lady
sarah
had
sent
her
for
no
other
purpose
but
to
satisfy
herself
from
her
maid
account
whether
the
report
she
had
heard
concerning
me
was
true
tell
your
lady
said
i
she
needed
not
to
have
been
at
the
pains
of
framing
such
a
message
to
have
gratified
her
curiosity
my
house
is
open
to
any
one
who
has
a
mind
to
look
at
it
even
to
lady
sarah
herself
you
shall
see
it
all
over
and
may
report
to
her
ladyship
what
my
cousin
warner
bounty
has
done
for
me
and
she
may
then
judge
whether
i
stand
in
need
of
the
assistance
she
now
pretends
to
offer
me
the
woman
looked
abashed
and
though
she
seemed
inclined
to
ask
questions
was
ashamed
to
do
so
this
was
that
very
servant
who
had
so
unceremoniously
led
me
up
the
back
stairs
when
i
went
to
visit
her
lady
but
i
appeared
in
a
quite
different
light
to
her
now
i
rang
the
bell
and
ordered
a
footman
to
her
the
she
curtsied
in
silence
and
withdrew
what
a
poor
creature
is
lady
sarah
mr
warner
called
upon
me
before
her
woman
went
away
i
told
him
the
whole
passage
oh
how
he
chuckled
and
rejoiced
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
rubbing
his
hands
he
wanted
to
see
the
servant
but
i
was
afraid
he
would
be
too
strong
in
his
insults
and
turned
him
from
the
point
he
told
me
he
invited
himself
to
dine
with
me
and
accordingly
he
favoured
me
with
his
company
and
staid
during
the
greatest
part
of
the
evening
he
is
a
man
of
a
strong
natural
sense
though
he
is
careless
of
improving
it
he
has
passed
his
life
in
business
and
in
acquiring
riches
he
does
not
let
me
into
the
particulars
of
these
though
he
is
in
other
respects
very
communicative
and
entertaining
there
is
a
whimsical
vein
runs
through
his
conversation
he
now
for
the
first
time
desired
me
to
give
him
the
particulars
of
my
life
from
my
childhood
which
he
had
but
a
partial
account
of
at
different
times
from
myself
i
took
up
the
story
at
the
earliest
period
of
my
life
wherein
any
thing
interesting
had
occurred
and
traced
every
circumstance
minutely
to
the
hour
he
first
saw
me
i
could
easily
see
that
he
had
a
tender
sympathizing
heart
for
he
was
moved
to
tears
more
than
once
during
my
relation
nor
was
he
ashamed
of
them
for
he
suffered
them
to
run
down
his
cheek
whilst
he
listened
with
mute
attention
to
my
story
he
praised
mr
faulkland
highly
said
he
was
a
man
after
his
own
heart
and
deserved
the
best
woman
in
the
world
i
wish
you
had
married
him
said
he
such
a
princely
fellow
deserves
a
princely
fortune
he
owned
my
brother
had
some
reason
to
be
nettled
at
my
refusal
of
such
a
man
our
sex
said
he
have
not
such
notions
as
you
women
have
but
still
that
does
not
excuse
his
sordidness
i
took
this
opportunity
of
telling
mr
warner
that
my
brother
did
not
really
know
the
very
great
distress
i
was
in
and
that
i
had
reason
to
believe
from
the
general
tenor
of
lady
sarah
character
that
she
had
either
concealed
it
from
him
or
made
misrepresentations
of
my
case
doubtless
she
had
not
informed
him
to
what
streights
i
was
reduced
immediately
upon
my
mother
death
and
who
knows
but
sir
george
having
left
me
for
a
while
to
feel
the
effects
of
that
resentment
with
which
he
had
threatened
me
in
his
last
letter
still
meant
to
shew
himself
a
brother
for
if
he
were
ignorant
as
i
am
willing
to
believe
of
that
particular
which
i
have
mentioned
he
could
not
suppose
that
i
was
driven
to
absolute
want
and
from
lady
sarah
insinuations
perhaps
he
thought
that
my
mother
left
a
sum
of
money
behind
her
he
knew
not
of
the
illness
that
my
children
and
i
were
visited
with
and
indeed
it
appears
to
me
from
what
he
hinted
to
yourself
that
he
was
quite
unacquainted
with
my
situation
to
say
the
truth
cecilia
as
you
know
i
am
of
a
placable
disposition
i
should
be
glad
to
be
on
good
terms
with
my
brother
the
only
relation
my
kinsman
excepted
that
i
have
in
the
world
i
was
willing
therefore
if
possible
a
little
to
reconcile
mr
warner
to
him
as
i
durst
not
without
his
permission
seek
a
reconciliation
with
sir
george
there
be
something
in
what
you
say
coz
answered
my
friend
perhaps
he
had
a
mind
to
let
you
bite
on
the
bridle
for
a
while
and
i
am
willing
to
suppose
with
you
that
hereafter
may
be
he
would
have
given
you
some
dirty
trifle
for
a
generous
thing
i
am
sure
he
is
not
capable
of
from
his
sordidness
to
me
i
found
this
stuck
most
with
the
good
man
oh
sir
said
i
but
consider
lady
sarah
influence
stepped
in
too
my
brother
you
acknowlege
going
to
give
you
something
she
half
a
crown
i
suppose
said
he
to
say
the
truth
i
believe
she
is
the
worst
of
the
two
she
has
a
great
deal
of
pride
sir
answered
i
she
has
communicated
some
of
it
to
my
brother
probably
he
was
mortified
and
disconcerted
at
the
sight
of
so
near
a
relation
in
his
wife
presence
whose
exteriour
appearance
could
do
him
no
credit
perhaps
had
you
applied
privately
to
him
he
would
have
behaved
better
you
have
not
much
worldly
wisdom
replied
my
cousin
to
excuse
him
thus
however
i
think
the
better
of
you
for
it
whatever
i
may
do
of
him
but
speak
honestly
now
do
you
want
to
be
friends
with
sir
george
that
he
and
his
wife
may
have
an
opportunity
of
seeing
you
in
all
your
finery
as
i
knew
mr
warner
temper
i
was
resolved
to
humour
him
in
it
and
thought
i
could
not
give
my
desire
of
seeing
my
brother
a
better
turn
than
this
to
one
of
my
disposition
to
deal
with
you
openly
sir
said
i
i
think
our
triumph
over
lady
sarah
will
not
be
complete
unless
she
herself
is
a
witness
of
that
high
fortune
of
which
she
might
have
been
a
partaker
had
it
not
been
for
her
own
meanness
of
spirit
and
to
be
sincere
with
you
my
cecilia
i
did
think
lady
sarah
deserved
this
mortification
though
it
did
not
so
far
influence
me
as
to
make
me
desirous
of
being
on
terms
with
her
as
for
my
brother
i
was
governed
by
no
other
motive
than
affection
towards
him
well
said
mr
warner
suppose
you
were
to
invite
them
both
to
dine
with
you
and
to
have
me
at
table
handsomely
dressed
out
for
i
can
dress
fine
when
i
please
and
let
them
see
that
the
man
who
was
not
thought
worthy
to
sit
down
in
their
presence
they
had
better
have
used
with
more
ceremony
oh
sir
said
i
that
would
be
too
severe
an
insult
besides
i
doubt
whether
my
brother
would
come
you
know
he
is
angry
with
me
and
thinks
he
has
reason
if
you
will
permit
me
first
to
call
on
my
brother
when
we
are
reconciled
i
can
afterwards
ask
both
him
and
his
lady
to
my
house
and
though
i
am
sure
you
have
too
much
good
nature
and
politeness
to
shock
them
all
at
once
by
violating
the
laws
of
hospitality
in
this
house
which
your
bounty
has
made
mine
yet
will
you
have
sufficient
room
for
retaliation
by
treating
them
in
your
turn
with
neglect
thou
art
a
milkly
thing
answered
mr
warner
but
as
i
am
willing
to
please
you
you
may
do
as
you
like
but
by
and
he
swore
a
tremendous
oath
they
shall
never
have
a
cross
from
me
having
obtained
mr
warner
consent
i
went
this
day
to
my
brother
he
was
not
at
home
but
i
was
introduced
to
lady
sarah
for
whom
i
enquired
poor
woman
how
she
looked
my
resentment
was
disarmed
and
i
felt
nothing
but
pity
her
confusion
was
so
great
she
knew
not
how
to
receive
me
she
curtsied
without
knowing
what
to
say
or
how
to
behave
i
would
not
embarrass
her
too
far
but
taking
a
chair
by
her
as
you
favoured
me
with
a
message
yesterday
lady
sarah
said
i
in
as
obliging
a
tone
as
i
could
speak
i
thought
it
a
sisterly
duty
to
wait
on
you
and
sir
george
i
hope
my
brother
is
well
i
long
to
see
him
and
flatter
myself
he
will
forget
all
former
coldness
and
again
be
my
brother
i
spoke
this
long
sentence
on
purpose
to
give
her
time
to
recover
herself
she
rubbed
her
hand
over
her
forehead
i
believe
to
hide
the
glow
that
was
in
her
face
from
my
first
entrance
mrs
arnold
i
am
so
surprized
this
visit
was
so
unexpected
i
thought
you
were
in
the
country
her
woman
you
know
had
been
with
me
the
day
before
i
passed
this
by
however
i
have
not
been
out
of
town
at
all
madam
i
was
detained
by
illness
am
mighty
sorry
for
it
i
hope
you
are
quite
recovered
pray
why
did
not
you
let
me
know
you
were
ill
as
i
had
heard
nothing
from
you
madam
after
my
first
message
i
was
afraid
that
the
mediation
you
were
so
kind
as
to
promise
me
had
failed
and
that
my
brother
resentment
was
so
great
he
would
not
hear
of
me
dear
that
is
true
indeed
it
was
a
sad
affair
i
mentioned
you
to
your
brother
when
he
came
to
town
but
he
was
in
a
passion
i
durst
not
name
you
to
him
again
she
durst
not
name
me
observe
that
my
dear
poor
george
whom
she
governs
with
despotic
sway
then
probably
madam
my
brother
knew
not
my
distress
i
protest
i
do
know
said
she
you
know
your
brother
is
very
warm
and
whenever
i
attempted
to
speak
of
you
he
always
stopped
me
short
so
i
do
know
how
it
was
but
i
never
could
get
to
tell
him
your
situation
i
should
think
i
had
great
reason
to
resent
my
brother
cruelty
madam
said
i
if
he
had
known
those
particulars
of
which
my
maid
informed
but
since
he
did
not
i
will
not
reproach
him
neither
will
i
accuse
your
ladyship
of
unkindness
in
concealing
them
from
him
my
sufferings
are
thank
god
at
an
end
and
i
am
now
come
to
offer
you
and
sir
george
my
sisterly
love
i
hope
he
will
not
refuse
me
his
love
in
return
i
have
nothing
else
now
to
ask
for
she
blushed
again
and
seemed
in
great
confusion
are
very
good
mrs
arnold
we
must
forget
and
forgive
shall
i
not
be
permitted
to
see
my
brother
madam
by
the
message
i
received
from
you
i
was
in
hopes
you
had
prevailed
on
him
the
woman
was
now
struck
dumb
she
felt
for
her
and
not
find
it
in
her
pocket
but
got
up
to
look
for
it
to
gain
a
little
time
rumaged
her
toilet
and
at
last
took
it
out
of
her
pocket
offered
me
a
pinch
of
snuff
then
sat
down
again
why
that
message
to
tell
you
the
truth
said
she
forcing
a
conscious
silly
smile
your
brother
knew
nothing
of
but
not
having
heard
from
you
in
so
long
a
time
i
was
resolved
to
enquire
after
you
and
was
determined
myself
out
of
my
own
to
allow
you
what
i
could
spare
till
i
could
get
sir
george
in
better
temper
but
i
made
use
of
his
name
because
i
thought
you
would
more
readily
accept
of
any
thing
from
him
than
from
me
your
brother
thought
you
were
actually
in
the
country
till
we
were
surprized
with
the
account
of
the
fortune
that
has
come
to
you
lately
you
heard
of
it
madam
interrupted
i
before
you
sent
to
me
an
untoward
question
my
dear
it
plunged
her
again
in
the
mud
and
she
flounced
and
floundered
to
get
out
which
only
sunk
her
the
deeper
we
had
heard
a
strange
flying
report
said
she
of
which
i
did
not
believe
a
word
and
therefore
sent
holmes
that
is
her
woman
name
to
you
to
offer
you
my
service
i
was
not
enough
my
cecilia
to
persist
in
embarrassing
this
mean
woman
any
farther
though
the
insincerity
of
her
whole
behaviour
and
the
low
falsities
she
had
recourse
to
very
well
deserved
reproof
i
was
glad
to
find
my
brother
was
not
so
culpable
as
he
had
at
first
appeared
for
i
could
easily
discover
from
the
whole
tenor
of
her
discourse
she
was
so
far
from
giving
him
any
intimation
of
my
distress
that
she
had
prevented
him
from
enquiring
after
me
by
telling
him
that
i
was
gone
out
of
town
probably
too
with
some
aggravating
circumstances
either
of
a
pretended
neglect
on
my
side
towards
them
both
or
perhaps
some
other
falshood
still
more
injurious
it
was
very
apparent
that
she
had
sent
her
maid
only
as
a
spy
and
by
way
of
passport
with
a
sham
offer
of
kindness
of
which
she
knew
i
stood
not
in
need
and
she
depended
on
my
pride
and
resentment
so
justly
provoked
for
my
never
coming
to
any
explanation
either
with
her
or
my
brother
no
wonder
then
she
was
so
confounded
at
the
sight
of
me
and
the
more
so
as
she
apprehended
i
might
reproach
my
brother
who
could
so
well
excuse
himself
by
pleading
ignorance
of
my
situation
and
her
conduct
must
then
appear
so
despicable
to
her
husband
that
hardy
as
she
is
she
would
be
at
a
loss
to
justify
it
all
this
being
very
obvious
to
me
i
determined
to
make
her
easy
at
once
i
shall
think
no
more
of
what
is
past
lady
sarah
said
i
i
only
wish
to
be
on
terms
of
friendship
with
my
brother
and
you
and
since
he
knows
not
of
the
message
you
sent
to
me
i
will
not
mention
it
to
him
nor
any
thing
else
that
can
recall
past
unkindness
i
hope
this
visit
will
be
taken
as
it
is
meant
out
of
pure
affection
and
that
you
madam
will
be
so
kind
as
to
make
my
peace
with
my
brother
whom
i
am
very
sorry
i
was
under
a
necessity
of
disobliging
but
as
i
never
did
offend
him
and
i
am
sure
never
should
but
in
that
one
instance
wherein
was
so
much
more
nearly
interested
than
himself
i
hope
he
will
think
no
more
of
it
but
restore
me
to
a
share
of
his
love
which
is
all
that
is
now
wanting
to
my
happiness
this
declaration
as
i
intended
it
should
entirely
restored
lady
sarah
tranquillity
her
countenance
brightened
up
i
take
upon
me
to
answer
for
sir
george
said
she
that
he
restore
you
to
his
affection
i
shall
insist
upon
a
general
act
of
oblivion
being
passed
on
his
side
and
i
beg
sister
on
your
part
that
you
may
not
by
reproaching
your
brother
revive
the
memory
of
your
past
coldness
the
weakest
people
are
often
very
cunning
this
caution
of
lady
sarah
artfully
enough
introduced
conveyed
an
obvious
meaning
to
me
very
different
from
her
pretended
reason
she
was
afraid
of
an
eclaircissement
i
promised
her
i
should
meet
my
brother
whenever
he
would
permit
me
as
if
nothing
had
ever
happened
to
disturb
our
friendship
see
my
dear
how
this
woman
do
not
name
me
when
i
was
poor
took
upon
her
now
to
her
husband
whose
anger
had
so
much
intimidated
her
subscribe
intirely
to
her
opinion
but
i
was
now
become
an
object
of
attention
a
finer
house
and
a
finer
equipage
than
her
ladyship
gave
me
an
indisputable
title
to
that
regard
to
which
as
a
and
in
distress
i
had
not
the
least
claim
she
now
ventured
to
ask
me
some
particulars
relating
to
the
very
extraordinary
change
in
my
fortune
i
satisfied
her
minutely
not
without
mentioning
the
cause
of
mr
warner
having
made
me
the
object
of
his
bounty
poor
lady
sarah
could
not
conceal
her
vexation
at
the
thoughts
of
what
she
had
lost
by
her
pride
and
parcimony
a
strange
whimsical
old
mortal
she
called
him
to
come
upon
them
so
abruptly
and
in
such
a
scandalous
garb
that
sir
george
was
quite
ashamed
of
him
i
am
glad
however
mrs
arnold
that
he
has
made
the
better
for
him
i
hope
he
will
continue
his
fondness
but
such
odd
humourists
are
not
to
be
depended
on
do
tell
him
however
what
i
say
i
should
be
glad
to
shew
him
any
civility
in
my
power
for
his
kindness
to
you
i
took
my
leave
of
her
ladyship
with
a
cordial
invitation
to
come
and
see
me
which
she
said
she
would
not
fail
to
do
mr
warner
called
on
me
for
a
few
minutes
in
the
evening
to
know
the
result
of
my
visit
as
i
had
told
him
i
intended
to
make
it
i
related
every
thing
that
had
passed
between
lady
sarah
and
me
he
enjoyed
her
confusion
as
i
described
it
with
a
triumphant
satisfaction
which
nothing
but
a
very
strong
resentment
could
have
excited
in
so
a
man
as
he
really
seems
to
be
he
has
added
to
my
store
of
china
of
which
i
have
already
an
abundance
a
pair
of
most
magnificent
jars
above
four
feet
high
which
he
values
at
a
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
these
with
an
entire
service
of
the
finest
nankeen
china
and
a
most
beautiful
persian
carpet
i
have
set
apart
as
a
present
for
lady
v
and
shall
send
them
to
her
the
first
opportunity
i
have
also
got
him
to
bespeak
a
set
of
jewels
to
the
amount
of
fifteen
hundred
pounds
with
which
i
intend
to
present
mrs
faulkland
this
sum
will
not
exceed
my
debt
to
mr
faulkland
if
his
agreement
with
pivet
stands
in
force
for
the
term
prescribed
mr
warner
who
mightily
loves
to
be
employed
has
undertaken
to
get
these
jewels
made
up
for
me
in
the
most
elegant
taste
this
man
generosity
is
as
inexhaustible
as
his
riches
i
fancy
he
is
still
some
way
concerned
in
trade
though
he
does
not
tell
me
so
these
jars
he
said
he
had
just
received
by
the
arrival
of
an
ship
and
i
understand
that
his
former
dealings
were
extremely
extensive
all
over
the
world
he
said
where
there
was
commerce
he
put
in
for
his
share
lady
sarah
has
returned
my
visit
she
was
not
slow
you
see
in
her
ceremony
obliging
polite
every
thing
praised
and
admired
and
at
every
second
word
and
the
children
caressed
children
what
a
fine
thing
it
is
my
dear
to
be
independent
i
shewed
her
all
my
house
but
not
with
ostentation
i
thought
it
would
have
looked
affected
not
to
have
recommended
so
much
wealth
and
elegance
to
her
notice
my
sideboard
she
says
is
absolutely
the
handsomest
she
ever
saw
indeed
both
for
workmanship
and
richness
it
does
surpass
any
i
have
seen
she
told
me
she
had
talked
to
my
brother
and
that
though
he
still
resented
my
obstinacy
as
called
it
yet
as
i
had
made
such
advances
towards
a
reconciliation
he
was
very
ready
to
meet
me
and
desired
every
thing
might
be
forgotten
on
my
side
as
it
should
be
on
his
he
would
have
come
to
see
you
added
lady
sarah
but
as
he
does
not
chuse
to
meet
mr
warner
he
would
rather
that
the
first
interview
between
you
were
at
his
own
house
i
told
her
ladyship
i
would
breakfast
with
her
the
next
morning
and
we
parted
upon
wonderful
courteous
just
returned
from
my
brother
sir
george
received
me
with
open
arms
and
i
returned
the
embrace
with
the
utmost
cordiality
of
affection
surely
my
dear
there
is
something
wonderfully
powerful
in
the
natural
affections
sir
george
spite
of
his
resentment
his
turbulence
and
the
threats
denounced
against
me
could
not
at
sight
of
me
after
an
absence
of
so
many
months
resist
the
first
impulse
of
his
heart
in
giving
me
strong
tokens
of
brotherly
love
though
probably
had
he
not
seen
me
the
latent
tenderness
might
have
lain
for
ever
dormant
in
his
heart
i
entered
immediately
on
the
topic
of
my
extraordinary
acquisition
as
i
was
determined
not
to
lead
to
a
subject
which
might
bring
on
explanations
so
much
dreaded
by
lady
sarah
and
i
could
observe
that
my
brother
avoided
any
thing
tending
that
way
as
much
as
i
did
he
congratulated
me
heartily
on
my
good
fortune
but
said
between
jest
and
earnest
that
if
he
could
have
divined
his
cousin
warner
had
come
to
him
to
make
experiments
he
should
have
taken
care
to
have
treated
him
better
but
i
do
know
how
it
was
said
he
he
came
in
an
evil
hour
and
i
was
in
an
ill
humour
lady
sarah
kept
up
the
conversation
with
a
great
deal
of
vivacity
always
taking
care
to
keep
us
clear
of
the
rock
she
was
afraid
of
till
a
lady
with
whom
she
was
engaged
to
go
to
an
auction
called
to
take
her
up
sir
george
would
fain
have
detained
me
but
she
insisted
on
my
going
with
her
to
have
judgment
she
said
on
the
things
she
intended
to
buy
it
appeared
to
me
that
she
did
not
chuse
to
leave
my
brother
and
me
together
for
fear
mutual
confidence
in
the
fullness
of
our
hearts
might
have
brought
her
disingenuous
proceedings
to
light
but
cunning
people
often
their
parts
she
was
so
extremely
pressing
that
my
brother
could
not
but
take
notice
of
it
i
acquiesced
to
avoid
giving
her
uneasiness
having
first
engaged
my
brother
to
dine
with
me
on
friday
lady
sarah
and
he
both
consented
but
premised
that
mr
warner
was
not
to
be
of
the
party
this
i
ventured
to
promise
as
i
was
resolved
if
mr
warner
invited
himself
which
is
his
usual
way
to
put
him
off
by
fairly
telling
him
the
truth
and
trusting
to
his
for
the
consequence
after
the
trivial
incidents
of
these
last
two
days
my
cecilia
now
hasten
to
more
interesting
particulars
but
first
a
word
or
two
of
my
cousin
warner
i
had
not
seen
him
since
the
day
that
my
brother
and
i
met
till
this
morning
when
he
called
to
ask
me
how
i
did
and
to
know
how
the
puppy
george
as
he
calls
him
had
behaved
to
me
after
having
satisfied
himself
in
this
enquiry
in
a
way
the
most
favourable
i
could
for
my
brother
i
told
him
that
as
i
had
really
found
both
him
and
his
lady
extremely
penitent
and
mortified
i
had
asked
them
to
dine
with
me
that
day
i
am
glad
of
it
said
he
very
quick
i
be
here
to
snoutch
them
dear
sir
said
i
for
heaven
sake
have
a
little
compassion
you
can
not
conceive
how
humbled
they
are
they
dare
not
look
you
in
the
face
and
it
was
one
of
their
conditions
with
me
before
they
would
consent
to
come
that
they
should
not
see
you
ho
ho
said
he
exultingly
have
they
changed
their
note
well
i
will
not
distress
you
so
far
in
your
own
house
as
to
mortify
them
with
my
company
at
dinner
but
if
i
should
take
it
in
my
head
to
drop
in
in
the
afternoon
you
must
not
take
it
amiss
i
only
want
to
see
them
look
a
little
like
fools
i
could
not
venture
to
oppose
him
in
this
but
resolved
to
make
it
as
easy
as
possible
by
preparing
my
brother
and
sister
for
his
visit
i
told
him
that
would
do
extremely
well
and
he
went
away
rejoicing
at
the
thoughts
of
his
intended
triumph
mr
warner
had
but
just
left
me
when
i
was
surprized
with
a
message
that
sir
george
was
below
i
went
down
to
him
directly
and
seeing
him
in
his
imagined
that
something
had
happened
which
prevented
their
dining
with
me
and
that
he
called
to
excuse
himself
but
he
undeceived
me
presently
as
i
had
not
an
opportunity
said
he
of
asking
you
any
questions
the
other
day
and
shall
be
prevented
probably
in
the
same
manner
this
day
i
am
come
to
have
an
hour
chat
with
you
before
dinner
and
first
pray
inform
me
sidney
where
you
have
lived
ever
since
my
mother
death
and
how
it
comes
to
pass
that
in
all
this
time
you
never
took
any
notice
of
either
lady
sarah
or
me
as
to
your
first
question
brother
it
is
easily
answered
i
have
never
been
out
of
london
for
the
rest
lest
us
avoid
all
retrospection
which
can
now
answer
no
end
to
either
of
us
you
surprize
me
said
he
i
understood
you
had
been
in
the
country
lady
sarah
told
me
that
you
were
gone
to
lady
v
she
was
misinformed
i
replied
what
was
the
meaning
then
said
he
that
you
never
called
or
sent
to
her
had
no
resentment
to
you
though
had
dear
sir
george
ask
me
no
more
questions
i
thought
it
had
been
premised
that
we
were
not
to
talk
of
the
past
i
see
sidney
answered
he
there
is
something
you
have
no
mind
to
explain
you
know
i
love
and
respect
my
wife
and
that
i
can
not
easily
be
brought
to
take
any
thing
ill
of
her
but
she
was
so
extremely
earnest
with
me
not
to
ask
you
any
questions
that
it
made
me
suspect
there
was
something
she
had
a
mind
to
conceal
from
me
what
confirms
me
in
this
opinion
is
that
as
i
know
you
are
ingenuous
and
open
to
conviction
you
would
have
made
me
some
apology
for
a
neglect
both
of
me
and
lady
sarah
which
you
could
not
but
suppose
offended
me
if
you
had
not
looked
upon
yourself
as
by
much
the
most
injured
person
you
urge
me
very
home
brother
i
thought
i
was
injured
when
you
disclaimed
all
relationship
to
me
if
i
did
not
comply
in
a
certain
particular
which
i
was
not
at
liberty
to
do
i
very
angry
with
you
said
he
but
should
not
have
carried
my
resentment
any
lengths
after
my
mother
death
if
you
had
made
any
concession
or
desired
to
throw
yourself
under
my
protection
instead
of
a
stranger
for
lady
v
comparatively
is
one
i
could
not
suppose
you
were
in
immediate
want
of
my
assistance
as
i
understand
my
private
purse
was
not
inconsiderable
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
was
resolved
till
you
did
condescend
to
inform
me
of
your
situation
not
to
give
myself
any
pain
about
you
i
can
only
tell
you
in
two
words
sir
george
that
you
have
been
extremely
misled
in
regard
to
me
i
wish
not
to
revive
so
disagreeable
a
subject
pray
say
no
more
of
it
but
one
word
more
said
he
just
for
my
own
satisfaction
and
then
i
have
done
was
lady
sarah
made
acquainted
with
your
circumstances
you
must
have
lived
in
miserable
obscurity
to
be
so
long
in
london
without
my
knowlege
you
love
and
respect
your
wife
brother
you
must
not
take
any
thing
ill
of
her
i
am
answered
he
replied
he
walked
about
the
room
and
i
could
see
he
was
ashamed
and
affected
you
will
make
me
very
unhappy
sir
george
said
i
if
you
resent
any
thing
on
my
account
to
your
lady
she
did
not
think
perhaps
that
things
were
quite
so
bad
with
me
as
they
really
were
but
if
she
heard
which
by
the
way
i
knew
was
an
invention
of
her
own
that
my
mother
left
any
thing
behind
her
she
was
deceived
there
really
was
nothing
but
let
us
call
another
when
did
you
hear
from
mr
faulkland
it
is
some
time
since
i
have
had
a
letter
from
his
lady
his
lady
he
repeated
and
stamping
with
his
foot
cursed
be
hour
which
gave
her
that
title
dear
sir
george
you
shock
me
how
can
you
be
so
uncharitable
so
unchristian
if
you
know
her
as
well
as
do
said
he
and
shook
his
head
you
are
so
strong
in
your
indignation
against
her
i
replied
that
you
almost
make
me
suspect
that
you
know
more
of
her
than
i
do
her
weakness
in
regard
to
mr
faulkland
excepted
i
could
never
entertain
an
ill
thought
of
her
but
you
have
raised
a
curiosity
which
though
i
tremble
to
have
it
gratified
yet
i
must
beg
you
to
speak
out
do
not
think
me
malicious
sidney
said
he
a
woman
reputation
is
too
sacred
a
thing
to
be
trifled
with
if
her
weakness
as
you
call
it
had
been
confined
to
mr
faulkland
should
be
so
with
me
but
i
can
not
think
with
temper
on
the
sacrifice
that
noble
fellow
has
been
forced
to
make
to
caprice
dear
brother
explain
yourself
you
terrify
me
my
heat
on
this
occasion
he
answered
would
be
unjustifiable
if
i
had
not
for
what
i
say
miss
burchell
for
i
will
not
call
her
by
my
friend
name
is
that
monster
a
female
libertine
a
rake
in
the
worst
sense
of
the
word
monstrous
cried
i
your
prejudice
makes
you
believe
every
cruel
tale
you
may
have
he
interrupted
with
an
indignant
smile
the
d
l
in
it
if
i
have
not
more
than
for
my
knowledge
lord
brother
you
make
me
shudder
what
do
you
mean
he
replied
you
will
not
believe
me
perhaps
when
i
tell
you
that
am
as
much
obliged
to
miss
burchell
favour
as
mr
faulkland
was
if
sir
george
had
plunged
a
dagger
in
my
heart
i
could
not
have
felt
a
sharper
pang
he
saw
me
struck
with
amazement
and
grief
i
knew
it
would
shock
you
said
he
but
you
extorted
the
secret
from
me
for
a
secret
it
has
and
ever
should
have
remained
but
in
my
own
justification
you
compelled
me
to
disclose
it
you
know
said
he
that
from
the
first
i
never
considered
engagement
to
her
as
a
serious
one
nor
in
any
shape
binding
this
judgment
i
formed
without
knowing
any
thing
of
the
woman
but
from
faulkland
own
representation
of
the
fact
tho
to
say
the
truth
he
always
spoke
of
her
with
more
tenderness
than
she
deserved
and
imputing
her
frailty
to
her
love
of
him
was
as
most
men
are
apt
to
do
on
such
occasions
disposed
to
judge
favourably
of
her
the
first
time
i
saw
her
was
at
that
time
when
my
mother
invited
her
and
when
you
may
remember
i
went
down
there
in
compliment
to
my
mother
i
own
i
thought
her
extremely
agreeable
which
was
alone
sufficient
to
make
me
a
little
more
than
barely
polite
but
my
mother
extraordinary
attachment
to
her
engaged
me
to
go
still
farther
and
to
oblige
her
i
was
more
than
ordinarily
attentive
to
please
miss
burchell
when
i
assure
you
upon
my
honour
that
i
had
no
farther
views
i
believe
you
will
not
doubt
my
veracity
but
whether
miss
burchell
mistook
my
civilities
for
fondness
or
whether
as
i
rather
believe
her
natural
disposition
was
so
loose
that
every
man
she
saw
lighted
up
a
flame
in
her
heart
i
know
not
but
certain
it
was
she
made
me
such
advances
that
i
must
have
been
extremely
stupid
not
to
have
understood
her
and
absolutely
frozen
to
have
repelled
her
my
good
mother
unsuspecting
temper
permitted
us
too
many
opportunities
and
the
light
ones
of
your
sex
do
not
easily
forgive
the
neglect
of
those
in
short
miss
burchell
yielded
to
the
impetuosity
of
her
wishes
and
i
followed
her
lead
more
through
vacancy
and
a
want
of
better
employment
than
out
of
inclination
i
was
very
glad
when
she
was
recalled
home
for
i
was
heartily
wearied
of
her
the
day
before
she
left
sidney
castle
when
we
were
alone
she
said
to
me
i
have
too
great
a
reliance
on
your
honour
to
suppose
you
capable
of
injuring
my
reputation
by
ever
divulging
what
has
passed
between
us
i
am
easy
therefore
on
that
head
but
there
is
one
circumstance
on
which
you
must
give
me
the
most
solemn
promise
that
is
in
your
power
to
make
without
which
i
shall
be
the
most
unhappy
creature
in
the
world
i
know
there
is
a
friendship
between
you
and
mr
faulkland
and
i
am
not
ignorant
that
you
men
in
your
unreserved
moments
of
confidence
do
not
scruple
to
disclose
such
secrets
as
i
have
trusted
you
with
i
do
not
fear
your
imprudence
with
regard
to
any
one
else
but
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
to
me
that
in
particular
should
never
know
what
my
tenderness
for
you
has
led
me
into
you
know
i
have
a
son
by
him
he
has
hitherto
provided
liberally
for
the
child
maintenance
and
to
let
you
into
a
secret
which
nobody
besides
must
know
i
myself
am
indebted
to
him
for
the
principal
part
of
my
support
though
he
as
well
as
the
rest
of
the
world
believe
that
i
have
a
fortune
now
though
i
do
not
entertain
the
least
hope
nor
indeed
wish
ever
to
be
mr
wife
yet
would
it
be
of
terrible
consequence
to
me
to
forfeit
his
regard
which
you
may
naturally
suppose
would
be
the
case
if
he
were
to
come
to
the
knowlege
of
what
has
happened
he
has
given
me
to
understand
by
his
that
when
he
comes
to
england
he
will
provide
for
me
the
woman
hinted
something
like
a
design
of
his
making
a
handsome
establishment
for
any
worthy
man
of
whom
i
should
make
choice
insinuating
at
the
same
time
that
this
depended
on
my
conduct
i
have
no
thoughts
of
marrying
but
as
mine
and
my
child
future
welfare
must
be
chiefly
owing
to
mr
faulkland
you
see
the
necessity
there
is
for
my
preserving
his
good
opinion
for
this
reason
then
my
dear
sir
george
you
must
swear
to
me
that
you
will
never
betray
me
to
him
the
reasons
were
so
plausible
and
the
request
so
natural
that
i
made
no
scruple
of
giving
her
a
solemn
oath
to
preserve
the
secret
inviolable
from
mr
faulkland
knowledge
for
so
she
herself
worded
the
promise
she
urged
me
to
make
in
regard
to
any
one
else
she
said
she
was
satisfied
all
assurances
were
needless
you
see
continued
my
brother
that
by
this
declaration
she
laid
me
under
a
double
tye
of
secrecy
as
i
had
no
conception
that
faulkland
could
ever
be
brought
to
think
of
marrying
her
i
thought
myself
bound
not
to
injure
her
in
his
opinion
and
therefore
religiously
kept
my
promise
faulkland
was
not
then
in
england
but
when
returned
and
came
to
visit
me
at
just
at
the
time
you
parted
from
your
husband
he
spoke
of
miss
burchell
in
a
manner
which
though
it
convinced
me
he
had
a
regard
for
her
and
wished
to
see
her
happy
yet
was
it
far
from
alarming
me
on
his
account
i
therefore
should
have
thought
it
the
highest
baseness
and
cruelty
to
have
hurt
her
in
his
esteem
i
never
have
had
the
least
intercourse
either
by
letter
or
otherwise
with
miss
burchell
since
we
parted
i
make
no
doubt
but
she
has
dispensed
her
favours
wherever
her
inclination
has
led
her
and
you
see
she
has
had
the
good
fortune
to
keep
all
her
amours
secret
but
what
hope
can
there
be
that
such
a
profligate
will
keep
her
faith
to
man
though
that
man
is
the
most
amiable
in
the
world
oh
brother
what
a
scene
of
iniquity
have
you
disclosed
i
would
to
heaven
you
had
kept
the
horrid
secret
to
yourself
or
divulged
it
time
enough
to
have
prevented
the
misery
into
which
i
unhappy
that
i
am
have
precipitated
your
friend
but
i
ought
not
to
blame
you
you
acted
agreeably
to
the
dictates
of
honour
detestable
woman
i
cried
in
the
bitterness
of
my
heart
i
do
not
wonder
at
her
cautioning
me
against
letting
you
into
my
design
of
urging
mr
faulkland
to
marry
her
i
then
little
knew
the
reason
you
had
for
the
opposition
she
said
you
would
give
to
this
fatal
match
every
thing
fell
out
to
her
wish
and
coincided
to
promote
her
successful
your
absence
from
london
mine
and
my
mother
urgency
and
the
too
generous
yielding
of
our
dear
unhappy
faulkland
i
burst
into
tears
my
heart
was
torn
with
anguish
and
in
that
instant
my
tenderness
for
him
revived
sir
george
strove
not
to
comfort
me
he
was
too
much
affected
himself
i
have
but
one
hope
said
i
and
that
is
in
the
extraordinary
love
she
has
for
mr
faulkland
and
his
uncommon
merit
which
may
probably
ensure
to
him
the
continuance
of
it
you
know
not
what
you
say
answered
my
brother
the
merit
of
an
angel
could
not
secure
the
fidelity
of
such
a
heart
as
her
her
love
is
gross
a
new
object
will
always
have
charms
for
her
had
i
been
as
credulous
as
faulkland
i
should
have
thought
myself
the
idol
of
her
soul
so
lavish
was
she
in
her
expressions
of
tenderness
is
it
not
strange
though
i
asked
that
with
so
loose
a
mind
she
should
have
so
long
preserved
an
attachment
to
mr
faulkland
for
most
certainly
her
affection
to
has
at
least
been
sincere
her
affection
to
his
estate
answered
my
brother
has
i
believe
all
along
been
sincere
do
you
not
know
she
is
a
beggar
i
told
him
in
this
she
had
imposed
on
him
to
answer
her
own
ends
in
engaging
him
the
more
firmly
to
keep
her
secret
for
to
my
knowledge
she
has
seven
thousand
pounds
as
i
was
informed
by
lady
v
who
knew
her
circumstances
sir
george
vented
two
or
three
curses
on
her
head
i
am
not
surprized
at
any
instance
of
her
falshood
said
he
she
is
made
up
of
deceit
such
characters
as
her
are
not
uncommon
but
none
of
them
ever
fell
in
your
way
before
and
i
hope
never
will
again
if
you
will
look
back
on
her
whole
conduct
however
it
may
surprize
you
you
will
find
there
is
nothing
inconsistent
in
it
she
is
only
a
sly
rake
in
petticoats
of
which
there
are
numbers
that
you
good
women
would
stare
at
if
you
knew
their
behaviour
she
considers
men
just
as
the
libertines
of
our
sex
do
women
she
likes
for
the
present
she
seduces
her
inclinations
cool
towards
an
old
lover
and
are
warmed
again
by
a
new
face
she
retained
not
faulkland
long
enough
to
grow
tired
of
him
and
therefore
possibly
still
preserved
some
tenderness
for
him
indeed
his
uncommon
attractions
must
have
made
an
impression
even
on
heart
but
this
did
not
hinder
her
from
indulging
her
inclinations
elsewhere
you
must
throw
into
the
account
too
that
she
had
by
accident
got
a
sort
of
hold
on
him
of
which
by
my
mother
indulgence
and
some
other
concurring
circumstances
she
hoped
one
day
or
other
to
avail
herself
with
so
pretty
a
person
as
she
has
and
the
fortune
you
tell
me
she
is
mistress
of
do
you
think
she
could
have
failed
of
marrying
creditably
if
that
had
been
her
view
no
no
she
meant
not
to
confine
herself
her
passion
for
faulkland
whether
real
or
pretended
gave
a
colour
to
her
preserving
that
liberty
in
the
licentious
use
of
which
she
placed
her
happiness
nor
would
she
in
the
end
have
confined
herself
within
the
bounds
of
marriage
if
an
immense
fortune
had
not
sweetened
the
restraint
i
pray
heaven
it
may
answered
i
is
all
we
have
now
to
trust
to
you
have
given
me
an
idea
of
a
character
which
i
thought
was
not
in
the
female
world
i
own
replied
sir
george
i
live
in
perpetual
fears
of
her
relapsing
into
vice
a
woman
without
principle
sidney
is
not
to
be
relied
on
love
if
in
such
a
breast
it
can
merit
that
name
even
towards
the
most
deserving
object
is
never
permanent
fear
and
even
shame
are
subdued
by
repeated
crimes
what
hold
then
remains
interest
alone
where
that
happens
to
interfere
but
if
detection
can
be
avoided
even
that
can
have
do
farther
influence
sir
george
took
his
leave
of
me
in
order
to
go
home
to
dress
but
i
was
not
to
say
a
word
of
his
morning
visit
so
that
i
found
i
needed
not
to
be
under
any
apprehensions
of
reproaching
lady
sarah
with
her
behaviour
towards
me
for
he
meant
not
to
let
her
know
he
was
informed
of
it
so
much
the
better
i
should
be
extremely
sorry
to
be
the
occasion
of
any
difference
between
them
they
came
at
the
appointed
hour
i
entertained
them
magnificently
and
we
were
all
harmony
and
good
humour
when
dinner
was
over
i
told
them
they
must
not
be
surprized
if
we
should
have
a
visit
from
our
west
indian
relation
in
the
evening
for
that
it
was
very
probable
he
would
call
and
if
i
should
be
denied
he
would
never
forgive
me
as
he
possibly
might
find
it
out
lady
sarah
looked
frightened
and
said
she
would
not
stay
but
sir
george
declared
he
would
arm
himself
with
a
few
bumpers
and
stand
his
ground
i
affected
to
treat
the
interview
with
pleasantry
and
reconciled
them
both
to
it
for
i
was
really
apprehensive
that
mr
warner
would
take
it
very
ill
and
think
i
betrayed
him
if
i
let
them
escape
i
supposed
too
that
after
he
had
indulged
himself
in
a
short
triumph
all
would
be
over
and
they
might
afterwards
meet
on
better
terms
in
less
than
half
an
hour
we
heard
a
loud
rap
lady
sarah
turned
pale
sir
george
laughed
at
her
but
was
himself
a
little
disconcerted
the
parlour
door
flew
open
a
footman
entered
mr
warner
and
in
stalked
my
kinsman
with
a
very
stately
tread
he
was
dressed
out
i
assure
you
a
large
well
powdered
wig
tied
with
a
rose
a
suit
of
the
finest
cloth
and
over
it
a
surtout
of
the
richest
mohair
and
silk
with
gold
frogs
and
a
fine
clouded
cane
with
a
gold
head
silk
stockings
of
the
same
colour
with
his
coat
a
fine
his
hat
under
his
arm
he
really
looked
very
and
venerable
for
he
appears
older
than
he
is
he
glanced
his
eyes
with
a
supercilious
scorn
over
my
brother
and
sister
who
stood
up
at
his
entrance
and
making
up
directly
to
me
saluted
me
and
took
his
place
by
me
a
short
silence
ensued
which
was
broken
by
my
asking
mr
warner
to
drink
a
glass
of
wine
i
could
almost
have
smiled
at
the
embarrassment
of
my
brother
and
lady
sarah
the
old
gentleman
enjoyed
it
and
looked
at
them
both
but
as
if
he
knew
neither
my
brother
had
recourse
to
the
bottle
he
drank
my
health
and
civilly
enough
bowed
to
mr
warner
just
pronouncing
the
word
sir
the
other
scarce
returned
it
by
a
slight
inclination
of
his
head
at
last
addressing
himself
to
me
cousin
if
you
have
no
aversion
to
tobacco
i
should
be
glad
if
you
would
indulge
me
with
a
pipe
is
my
custom
after
dinner
but
i
have
not
smoaked
yet
as
i
had
never
observed
him
to
do
this
when
he
had
dined
with
me
before
i
took
it
for
granted
the
compliment
was
meant
for
lady
sarah
i
said
had
no
objection
and
referred
myself
by
a
bow
to
lady
sarah
she
made
no
reply
and
my
kinsman
without
seeming
to
mind
any
one
else
rang
the
bell
saying
if
do
dislike
it
there
is
no
more
to
be
said
the
black
whom
he
had
given
me
presenting
himself
at
the
door
mr
warner
desired
him
to
step
to
his
lodgings
for
his
pipe
and
some
tobacco
the
man
quickly
returned
with
a
long
japaned
reed
with
a
boll
fixed
at
the
end
of
it
mr
warner
called
for
a
lighted
taper
and
throwing
himself
back
in
his
chair
with
one
leg
crossed
over
the
other
lighted
his
pipe
with
much
composure
puffing
large
clouds
of
lady
sarah
nose
who
sat
at
his
my
sister
who
had
really
an
unaffected
aversion
to
tobacco
could
not
bear
this
she
coughed
excessively
and
with
tears
in
her
eyes
rose
off
her
chair
and
retired
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
my
old
gentleman
laughed
till
he
weezed
nodding
his
head
after
her
and
looking
at
me
as
much
as
to
say
i
am
glad
i
have
sent
her
off
sir
george
though
determined
not
to
be
put
out
of
humour
thought
this
was
going
too
far
i
was
really
uneasy
myself
and
hardly
knew
how
to
act
for
if
i
shewed
any
mark
of
distinction
to
lady
sarah
i
knew
it
would
be
construed
by
mr
warner
as
an
affront
to
him
i
ventured
however
to
tell
her
that
if
she
would
step
into
the
i
should
order
coffee
and
wait
on
her
immediately
ay
said
my
brother
approaching
his
lady
and
taking
her
by
the
hand
let
us
get
out
of
this
horrid
atmosphere
that
this
honest
gentleman
has
raised
about
us
the
honest
gentleman
vouchsafed
not
to
look
at
him
and
my
brother
and
sister
withdrew
into
the
adjoining
room
as
soon
as
they
were
gone
mr
warner
threw
down
his
pipe
and
striking
the
table
with
his
clenched
fist
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
lord
lord
said
he
pride
have
a
fall
i
think
i
have
brought
them
down
a
little
how
like
asses
they
both
looked
well
now
i
am
satisfied
i
have
had
my
revenge
you
may
go
and
drink
your
coffee
with
them
bid
you
he
immediately
withdrew
and
i
joined
my
brother
and
sister
who
were
heartily
rejoiced
that
they
had
got
rid
of
him
sir
george
said
he
saw
his
design
but
was
resolved
not
to
give
an
opportunity
for
insults
and
so
held
his
tongue
as
he
is
your
friend
sidney
said
he
i
would
not
distress
you
by
engaging
you
as
a
party
on
either
side
which
must
have
been
the
case
for
that
old
fellow
would
not
have
suffered
you
to
remain
neutral
i
told
him
our
kinsman
was
whimsical
but
that
as
he
was
now
thoroughly
satisfied
at
having
paid
them
in
kind
i
was
sure
he
would
never
again
seek
to
give
them
any
offence
and
they
ought
to
forgive
him
by
the
law
of
retaliation
they
laughed
at
the
singularity
of
his
manner
and
the
whole
passed
off
in
mirth
though
lady
sarah
declared
he
had
made
her
quite
sick
with
his
nauseous
tobacco
the
ridiculous
scene
my
cecilia
for
a
while
called
off
my
thoughts
from
the
melancholy
subject
which
is
now
nearest
my
heart
i
mean
the
shocking
account
which
sir
george
gave
me
of
mrs
can
i
bear
to
call
her
faulkland
but
it
now
recurs
to
me
with
all
its
horrors
oh
my
dear
what
a
fatal
wretch
have
i
been
to
mr
faulkland
my
best
purposes
by
some
unseen
power
are
perverted
from
their
ends
i
wonder
the
food
which
i
take
to
nourish
me
is
not
converted
into
poison
when
i
touch
it
but
i
will
calm
my
troubled
mind
with
this
reflexion
that
i
not
to
do
evil
mr
faulkland
ignorant
of
his
own
misfortune
may
as
hundreds
of
others
in
the
same
situation
are
still
be
happy
if
that
light
creature
has
but
a
single
grain
of
honour
or
gratitude
i
will
not
think
of
it
anticipating
as
you
used
to
call
me
i
will
banish
the
hateful
idea
from
my
mind
what
do
you
think
my
cecilia
mrs
gerrarde
has
eloped
from
her
husband
and
is
now
at
paris
in
quality
of
mistress
to
a
young
nobleman
who
maintains
her
in
vast
splendour
i
had
this
news
in
a
letter
from
mrs
faulkland
poor
pivet
wrote
his
master
an
account
of
it
you
know
the
agreement
to
pay
this
young
man
an
annual
sum
was
conditional
upon
mr
death
pivet
tired
of
the
termagant
spirit
and
intolerable
coquetry
of
his
wife
was
very
glad
to
relax
his
discipline
and
declared
were
he
to
have
had
a
thousand
a
year
he
would
not
undertake
to
keep
her
within
bounds
and
that
nothing
but
his
great
respect
for
mr
faulkland
could
have
engaged
him
in
the
task
so
long
he
acknowleges
that
he
is
very
glad
to
be
rid
of
her
and
as
mr
faulkland
enabled
him
to
set
up
very
handsomely
in
his
business
i
really
think
he
is
happy
in
his
loss
i
have
been
deeply
affected
my
cecilia
within
these
two
days
if
it
had
not
been
in
my
power
to
relieve
the
distress
i
have
been
a
witness
to
how
unhappy
would
it
have
made
me
i
was
stepping
out
of
my
chariot
yesterday
morning
when
a
young
woman
who
stood
at
my
door
in
an
old
linnen
gown
presented
to
me
a
little
open
and
filled
with
artificial
flowers
she
spoke
not
but
the
silent
anguish
in
her
looks
drew
my
attention
she
seemed
about
eighteen
and
very
pretty
as
an
appearance
of
industry
i
think
doubles
the
claim
which
the
poor
have
to
our
compassion
i
took
out
of
her
box
a
small
sprig
of
jessamin
very
naturally
imitated
and
asked
the
young
woman
if
she
made
those
flowers
herself
she
modestly
replied
she
did
and
can
not
you
child
said
i
find
any
one
who
would
give
you
constant
employment
in
this
way
to
prevent
your
wandering
about
in
the
streets
to
dispose
of
your
work
she
answered
yes
madam
but
i
have
a
poor
decrepid
father
in
jail
who
can
not
be
without
my
assistance
i
live
with
him
and
only
come
out
once
a
week
to
sell
my
flowers
i
might
go
to
service
but
he
would
die
if
i
were
to
leave
him
her
gentle
speech
her
youth
and
the
unaffected
tender
sorrow
that
appeared
in
her
face
when
she
spoke
of
her
father
touched
me
to
the
heart
i
bade
her
come
in
and
taking
her
into
the
parlour
was
desirous
to
ask
her
some
questions
you
look
said
i
as
if
you
had
not
been
bred
in
poverty
pray
what
is
your
father
she
blushed
and
with
eyes
replied
a
clergyman
madam
a
clergyman
i
repeated
what
misfortunes
for
such
i
must
suppose
they
were
drove
him
to
the
distressed
situation
you
mention
it
a
misfortune
madam
and
not
any
crime
answered
the
girl
with
tears
in
her
eyes
my
father
is
as
good
a
man
as
ever
was
born
i
asked
his
name
and
she
told
me
it
was
price
my
curiosity
was
excited
by
her
manner
i
desired
her
to
sit
down
and
relate
to
me
the
particulars
of
her
story
she
obeyed
with
a
sensible
politeness
that
pleased
me
about
twelve
years
ago
said
she
my
father
had
a
little
cure
in
berkshire
he
was
reckoned
a
fine
preacher
and
a
very
great
scholar
and
what
was
more
than
either
one
of
the
best
of
men
in
the
parish
to
which
my
father
belonged
lived
a
gentleman
of
a
very
great
estate
his
name
was
ware
he
was
himself
a
very
worthy
man
and
had
so
high
an
opinion
of
my
father
that
he
pitched
upon
him
to
go
abroad
in
quality
of
governor
to
his
only
son
then
a
youth
of
about
nineteen
as
my
father
had
travelled
in
the
same
capacity
once
before
he
was
very
well
qualified
for
the
employment
and
had
no
objection
to
the
acceptance
of
it
but
his
leaving
my
mother
of
whom
he
was
very
fond
and
me
his
only
child
then
scarcely
more
than
an
infant
the
elder
mr
ware
assured
him
he
would
be
a
friend
and
guardian
to
us
both
and
so
he
was
and
that
he
would
in
his
absence
allow
us
double
the
income
which
my
father
received
from
his
cure
this
together
with
the
appointment
which
he
was
to
receive
as
his
son
governor
was
too
handsome
an
offer
to
be
refused
especially
as
the
gentleman
promised
he
should
never
want
a
patron
in
him
while
he
lived
and
every
body
knew
he
had
interest
enough
to
make
this
promise
of
consequence
my
father
was
then
past
fifty
but
as
he
was
of
a
very
healthy
strong
constitution
he
did
not
think
it
too
late
to
undertake
for
the
good
of
his
family
what
he
said
was
a
very
troublesome
task
i
could
not
help
interrupting
the
young
gentlewoman
to
ask
her
how
it
came
to
pass
that
her
father
such
a
man
as
she
represented
him
to
be
was
no
better
provided
for
at
this
time
of
life
especially
as
she
said
he
had
before
been
intrusted
with
the
care
of
a
pupil
whom
i
presumed
to
be
a
person
of
fortune
as
scarce
any
others
are
sent
to
travel
she
said
he
had
a
small
patrimony
of
his
own
and
that
his
original
design
was
to
study
physic
but
being
persuaded
by
the
love
he
bore
a
young
gentleman
to
whom
he
was
private
tutor
at
the
university
to
go
abroad
with
him
he
had
for
some
years
while
they
continued
on
their
travels
been
obliged
to
decline
this
study
when
he
had
brought
his
pupil
safe
back
to
england
he
intended
to
pursue
it
and
for
this
purpose
was
preparing
to
go
to
leyden
but
the
gentleman
who
really
had
an
affection
for
him
declared
he
could
not
part
with
him
and
that
if
he
would
consent
to
stay
and
take
holy
orders
he
would
get
him
a
living
which
was
in
his
father
gift
a
nobleman
then
alive
as
soon
as
it
should
become
vacant
of
which
there
was
a
good
prospect
on
account
of
the
age
of
the
incumbent
and
that
in
the
mean
time
he
should
live
with
him
as
the
young
gentleman
had
been
married
immediately
after
his
return
from
his
travels
to
a
lady
of
vast
fortune
and
was
settled
with
a
family
of
his
own
about
him
my
father
who
fondly
loved
him
did
not
disrelish
the
proposal
and
without
much
difficulty
consented
to
it
he
now
laid
aside
the
thoughts
of
physic
and
turned
his
attention
to
the
study
of
divinity
nor
was
he
in
haste
for
the
promised
living
being
vacated
as
he
was
resolved
not
to
take
orders
till
he
was
properly
qualified
for
the
holy
profession
he
was
now
destined
to
he
continued
thus
four
years
with
his
young
patron
the
gentleman
who
possessed
the
living
though
very
sickly
still
holding
it
my
father
then
being
inclined
to
go
into
orders
his
friend
got
him
nominated
to
a
cure
in
town
the
duties
of
which
he
constantly
performed
for
two
years
still
living
with
his
benefactor
but
it
was
his
misfortune
then
to
lose
him
he
was
drowned
in
crossing
a
deep
water
on
which
he
thought
was
fordable
my
poor
father
had
now
lost
as
it
proved
his
only
friend
though
he
then
lamented
him
as
a
son
he
loved
and
i
have
heard
him
say
he
was
more
afflicted
for
his
death
than
his
real
father
was
as
that
nobleman
was
well
acquainted
with
his
son
intentions
in
regard
to
his
tutor
my
father
had
no
doubts
of
his
fulfilling
them
especially
as
he
had
given
his
promise
to
do
so
about
this
time
the
curate
of
the
parish
in
berkshire
which
i
mentioned
to
you
before
having
a
mind
to
make
an
exchange
for
one
in
london
where
all
his
friends
lived
proposed
it
to
my
father
who
had
been
at
college
with
him
as
he
had
now
no
attachment
in
town
and
preferred
a
country
life
he
readily
agreed
to
the
change
and
having
first
waited
on
the
father
of
his
late
friend
to
remind
him
of
his
promise
which
he
again
confirmed
he
went
down
to
berkshire
here
it
was
he
fell
in
love
with
my
mother
who
was
the
daughter
of
the
rector
whose
cure
he
served
she
liked
him
and
as
her
father
looked
upon
him
as
a
man
certain
of
preferment
and
every
way
esteemable
in
his
character
he
did
not
scruple
to
give
her
to
him
in
a
few
months
after
their
marriage
the
incumbent
of
the
living
died
my
father
immediately
waited
on
the
nobleman
so
sure
of
success
that
he
thought
he
should
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
thank
him
for
it
but
that
lord
told
him
with
a
pretended
concern
that
he
had
disposed
of
it
having
heard
that
my
father
was
well
provided
for
in
berkshire
and
had
married
a
lady
of
great
fortune
he
returned
home
shocked
and
disappointed
more
on
account
of
the
family
he
had
married
into
than
on
his
own
he
now
found
himself
at
near
forty
years
of
age
with
a
family
coming
on
him
and
no
other
provision
than
a
curacy
of
forty
pounds
a
year
my
grandfather
pretended
he
had
been
deceived
by
him
and
made
that
excuse
for
withdrawing
all
his
favour
from
him
my
mother
had
children
pretty
fast
but
they
all
died
young
excepting
myself
and
as
he
loved
her
too
well
to
let
her
feel
the
inconvenience
of
streightened
circumstances
he
was
content
to
let
his
own
little
patrimony
which
he
had
preserved
till
now
gradually
waste
for
my
grandfather
never
gave
her
any
fortune
at
his
death
which
happened
a
few
years
after
it
appeared
he
could
not
for
he
left
but
little
behind
him
in
this
situation
my
father
having
lost
all
hopes
of
being
better
provided
for
with
the
melancholy
reflexion
of
having
thrown
away
the
best
part
of
his
days
in
a
fruitless
attendance
and
expectation
dragged
on
a
life
of
obscurity
and
toil
for
eleven
years
and
then
it
was
that
mr
ware
applied
to
him
in
the
manner
i
have
mentioned
i
told
this
amiable
girl
i
was
glad
i
had
interrupted
the
thread
of
her
story
as
by
that
means
she
had
obliged
me
with
so
many
interesting
particulars
of
her
family
and
then
requested
she
would
proceed
she
bowed
with
a
pretty
modest
grace
and
went
on
i
informed
you
madam
that
my
father
having
accepted
of
the
tuition
of
mr
ware
son
prepared
to
attend
him
on
his
travels
he
took
his
leave
very
reluctantly
of
my
poor
mother
and
me
whom
he
tenderly
recommended
to
mr
ware
patronage
and
set
out
with
the
young
gentleman
having
given
up
his
cure
as
his
absence
was
to
be
of
a
long
continuance
mr
ware
who
was
a
truly
good
man
was
punctual
in
the
performance
of
his
promise
towards
my
mother
and
me
and
behaved
while
my
father
was
away
like
a
second
parent
his
son
continued
abroad
upwards
of
four
years
and
returned
a
very
accomplished
gentleman
mr
ware
was
exceedingly
pleased
with
my
father
conduct
for
which
he
told
him
both
his
son
and
himself
owed
him
the
utmost
gratitude
he
was
now
far
advanced
in
years
and
grown
indolent
from
infirmities
he
thought
it
better
to
be
himself
the
rewarder
of
my
father
merit
than
take
upon
him
the
trouble
of
soliciting
other
people
to
provide
for
him
and
accordingly
resolved
to
give
him
an
annual
income
of
two
hundred
pounds
during
his
life
he
told
him
at
the
same
that
as
his
estate
was
entailed
it
was
not
in
his
power
to
confirm
this
grant
by
a
will
but
he
was
sure
his
son
was
too
sensible
of
what
he
owed
him
not
to
promise
in
the
most
solemn
manner
to
continue
to
him
this
income
when
he
should
come
into
his
inheritance
the
young
gentleman
who
was
present
handsomely
acknowleged
the
obligations
he
had
to
my
father
and
assured
him
he
thought
he
could
never
sufficiently
repay
them
my
father
who
now
wished
for
nothing
more
than
to
sit
down
peacably
on
a
competency
thought
himself
very
happy
he
retired
to
his
little
house
in
berkshire
where
my
mother
and
i
still
lived
and
gave
himself
up
to
domestic
contentment
the
old
gentleman
was
punctual
to
his
agreement
constantly
paying
my
father
fifty
pounds
every
quarter
he
died
in
something
less
than
three
years
his
son
immediately
on
his
accession
to
his
fortune
being
at
that
time
in
london
wrote
my
father
a
very
affectionate
letter
assuring
him
of
the
continuance
of
his
friendship
nor
did
he
fail
in
his
promise
for
two
years
he
was
punctual
in
his
remittances
to
my
father
he
did
not
during
that
time
come
down
to
berkshire
having
another
of
which
he
was
fonder
at
this
time
i
lost
my
dear
mother
who
had
been
for
some
years
in
a
declining
way
and
though
during
her
health
as
she
was
an
exceedingly
good
oeconomist
my
father
might
have
laid
by
some
of
his
income
yet
the
frequent
journies
she
was
prescribed
to
bath
and
other
places
for
change
of
air
together
with
the
expence
of
physicians
at
home
put
it
out
of
his
power
to
save
any
thing
which
on
my
account
gave
him
great
uneasiness
but
as
he
was
still
strong
and
hale
he
was
in
hopes
he
might
yet
live
to
lay
by
something
for
me
i
was
now
about
fifteen
and
the
darling
of
my
father
heart
he
was
inconsolable
for
my
mother
death
but
i
endeavoured
to
comfort
him
and
at
last
in
some
measure
succeeded
mr
ware
whom
my
father
had
not
seen
since
the
death
of
the
good
old
gentleman
came
down
now
to
revisit
his
paternal
seat
he
would
not
omit
paying
a
visit
of
condolement
to
his
old
friend
and
tutor
and
accordingly
came
to
our
house
the
day
after
his
arrival
in
the
country
though
i
had
seen
him
before
as
it
was
in
my
childhood
i
had
taken
but
little
notice
of
him
he
is
indeed
a
handsome
genteel
young
man
the
innocent
girl
blushed
as
she
spoke
these
words
but
i
seemed
not
to
observe
it
she
proceeded
with
a
sigh
my
father
who
loved
him
was
rejoiced
to
see
him
mr
ware
behaved
with
a
tenderness
and
respect
almost
filial
towards
him
and
very
obliging
to
me
he
continued
about
a
week
in
the
country
calling
to
ask
my
father
how
he
did
every
day
when
he
was
about
to
return
to
london
he
pressed
my
father
to
pass
a
few
weeks
with
him
in
town
you
are
melancholy
here
said
he
changing
the
scene
a
little
will
divert
both
your
daughter
and
you
my
father
thanked
him
for
the
honour
he
did
him
but
modestly
declined
it
mr
ware
guessed
at
his
motive
and
told
him
smiling
i
know
your
objection
but
to
obviate
it
at
once
i
must
tell
you
that
i
have
prevailed
on
my
sister
to
come
and
keep
house
for
me
and
i
expect
to
find
her
at
home
on
my
return
i
knew
his
sister
a
maiden
lady
some
years
older
than
himself
who
had
on
the
death
of
his
father
gone
to
live
with
a
near
relation
of
theirs
my
father
smiling
in
his
turn
told
him
he
had
guessed
his
mind
rightly
and
since
that
was
the
case
he
would
not
deprive
his
poor
girl
looking
at
me
of
the
happiness
of
the
good
lady
company
for
a
while
mr
ware
said
we
might
go
to
town
with
him
in
his
coach
and
as
we
had
but
little
preparation
to
make
we
set
out
with
him
next
day
when
we
arrived
at
his
house
in
london
he
welcomed
us
with
all
the
marks
of
politeness
and
respect
i
was
surprized
we
did
not
see
his
sister
the
whole
night
but
as
she
was
not
apprized
of
our
coming
i
thought
that
either
she
was
abroad
or
had
not
yet
quitted
her
friend
with
whom
she
lived
the
next
morning
at
breakfast
mr
ware
made
an
apology
for
his
absence
he
said
that
the
lady
at
whose
house
she
lived
was
ill
and
that
she
could
not
possibly
leave
her
till
she
was
better
which
he
supposed
would
be
in
a
few
days
as
her
sickness
was
no
other
than
the
consequence
of
her
mean
while
he
hoped
mr
price
would
not
be
uneasy
as
he
was
himself
his
daughter
guardian
though
my
father
was
not
pleased
at
this
excuse
he
however
concealed
his
thoughts
from
mr
ware
but
told
me
if
miss
ware
did
not
come
home
in
a
few
days
he
purposed
that
we
should
take
our
leave
and
return
into
the
country
we
had
very
handsome
apartments
assigned
us
and
my
father
was
put
in
possession
of
mr
ware
library
a
very
noble
one
where
that
gentleman
knew
he
would
pass
his
most
agreeable
hours
for
my
part
as
i
did
not
care
to
go
abroad
i
had
a
proper
person
for
me
to
appear
with
i
declined
the
offer
mr
ware
very
obligingly
made
of
getting
some
ladies
of
his
acquaintance
to
take
me
to
public
places
i
expected
his
sister
every
day
and
if
she
came
as
i
knew
my
father
purposed
staying
for
a
month
i
thought
i
should
have
time
enough
to
see
every
thing
so
i
chose
to
entertain
myself
with
working
and
reading
in
my
own
room
but
madam
i
soon
found
that
mr
ware
was
a
very
base
man
the
third
day
after
we
came
to
his
house
his
behaviour
towards
me
began
to
change
intirely
from
what
it
was
before
he
took
every
opportunity
of
being
particular
to
me
in
his
compliments
i
received
them
at
first
with
that
distant
civility
which
i
thought
would
neither
encourage
nor
offend
i
looked
upon
him
as
a
worthy
young
man
and
my
father
friend
and
benefactor
and
thought
in
my
humble
station
i
should
not
be
too
quick
at
taking
exceptions
as
there
had
nothing
as
yet
appeared
in
his
behaviour
which
exceeded
the
bounds
of
respect
but
he
did
not
preserve
this
long
on
the
fifth
day
he
came
into
a
closet
where
i
was
reading
and
there
in
the
warmest
manner
declared
himself
my
lover
i
would
fain
have
turned
his
discourse
into
pleasantry
but
he
had
recourse
to
oaths
and
protestations
and
swore
he
could
not
live
without
my
favour
i
represented
the
cruelty
of
the
insult
he
offered
me
in
his
own
house
and
begged
he
would
leave
me
as
i
was
determined
to
depart
immediately
i
will
not
sir
said
i
let
my
father
know
the
unkind
return
you
have
made
for
all
his
care
of
you
but
i
can
easily
prevail
with
him
to
leave
your
house
he
fell
at
my
feet
begged
my
pardon
and
talked
all
that
sort
of
stuff
which
i
have
read
in
romances
at
length
i
got
him
out
of
the
closet
and
locked
the
door
resolving
never
to
sit
alone
without
using
the
same
precaution
while
we
staid
in
his
house
which
i
hoped
would
not
be
above
a
day
or
two
longer
for
i
concluded
there
was
no
sister
to
come
and
that
this
was
only
made
use
of
as
a
snare
to
draw
us
to
town
as
i
had
a
mind
to
try
the
young
girl
i
asked
her
how
came
you
to
receive
mr
ware
addresses
in
the
manner
you
mentioned
how
did
you
know
but
he
intended
to
marry
you
ah
no
madam
said
she
i
could
not
entertain
such
a
thought
i
have
not
troubled
you
with
the
particulars
of
what
he
said
to
me
but
young
as
i
was
i
knew
too
well
what
it
tended
to
besides
the
fear
he
shewed
lest
my
father
should
know
of
his
pretended
courtship
was
enough
to
convince
me
what
his
designs
were
without
any
thing
else
to
guide
me
did
you
like
him
i
asked
the
ingenuous
young
woman
blushed
i
have
liked
him
madam
she
replied
better
than
any
body
i
had
ever
seen
if
there
had
not
been
such
a
distance
between
us
i
desired
her
to
proceed
i
told
my
father
that
same
evening
that
as
i
saw
there
was
no
likelihood
of
the
lady
coming
to
her
brother
and
as
i
led
but
a
melancholy
life
having
no
woman
to
converse
with
i
had
much
rather
be
at
home
amongst
my
neighbours
and
acquaintance
and
begged
he
would
return
to
berkshire
my
father
said
it
was
what
he
had
determined
on
after
completing
our
week
in
town
unless
miss
ware
came
in
the
interim
i
have
just
told
our
friend
so
said
he
he
seems
to
take
it
unkindly
and
says
he
is
afraid
he
has
disobliged
me
but
i
assured
him
my
only
reason
was
that
i
did
not
think
the
house
of
a
handsome
young
batchelor
a
proper
place
for
a
pretty
little
country
girl
even
though
her
old
father
was
with
her
he
assures
me
his
sister
will
come
and
wants
to
protract
our
stay
a
few
days
longer
i
hardly
know
how
to
refuse
his
entreaties
but
i
shall
be
uneasy
till
we
are
at
home
i
told
my
father
mr
ware
had
too
much
sense
to
take
his
refusal
amiss
and
begged
of
him
to
stick
to
his
day
i
gave
mr
ware
no
opportunity
of
speaking
to
me
the
remainder
of
that
day
nor
all
the
next
though
he
came
to
my
closet
door
where
i
always
sat
and
entreated
for
admission
but
i
was
peremptory
in
my
denial
and
he
went
away
reproaching
me
with
cruelty
mr
ware
made
an
apology
to
my
father
on
account
of
his
being
obliged
to
spend
the
evening
abroad
the
first
time
that
he
had
been
absent
from
us
since
we
came
to
his
house
he
had
twice
entertained
us
with
a
very
agreeable
concert
at
which
there
was
a
great
deal
of
company
both
gentlemen
and
ladies
he
had
got
it
performed
at
his
own
house
on
purpose
to
amuse
my
father
who
was
a
great
lover
of
music
but
excepting
those
two
mornings
i
had
never
seen
any
company
with
him
as
he
said
he
would
not
invite
strangers
i
had
got
a
companion
of
my
own
sex
to
keep
me
in
countenance
my
father
and
i
supped
alone
we
were
to
go
out
of
town
the
next
day
and
we
retired
to
our
respective
chambers
about
eleven
in
order
to
go
to
bed
the
poor
girl
paused
at
this
part
of
her
story
as
if
she
were
ashamed
to
proceed
i
hope
said
i
mr
ware
did
not
violate
the
laws
of
hospitality
by
intruding
on
you
that
night
oh
madam
he
did
he
did
said
she
the
vile
wretch
hid
himself
somewhere
i
know
not
where
for
it
was
not
in
my
closet
the
slept
in
my
room
in
a
little
which
had
been
put
up
for
that
purpose
but
she
was
not
as
yet
come
up
stairs
the
who
had
attended
me
to
my
room
told
me
there
was
to
be
a
great
deal
of
company
to
dine
with
her
master
the
next
day
and
as
the
was
very
busy
in
making
jellies
and
pastry
she
was
afraid
she
should
sit
up
late
and
hoped
i
should
not
be
disturbed
at
her
coming
into
the
room
i
always
dismissed
the
maid
immediately
as
i
was
not
used
to
have
a
person
undress
me
i
went
to
bed
but
not
being
a
very
sound
sleeper
and
knowing
a
particularity
i
had
which
was
that
if
once
rouzed
i
could
not
compose
myself
to
rest
again
i
resolved
not
to
attempt
it
at
all
the
came
to
bed
i
placed
the
candle
on
a
stand
near
me
and
took
up
a
book
that
i
found
on
a
chair
by
my
which
i
had
been
reading
in
the
evening
i
had
been
about
an
hour
thus
employed
when
i
heard
somebody
treading
softly
in
the
room
as
i
had
not
heard
the
door
open
i
called
out
in
a
fright
to
know
who
was
there
i
received
no
answer
but
immediately
mr
ware
presented
himself
on
his
knees
at
my
and
half
leaning
on
my
bed
i
shrieked
out
i
knew
not
what
he
said
but
i
remember
the
most
wicked
of
men
held
me
fast
and
talked
a
great
deal
i
continued
shrieking
incessantly
and
struggling
to
get
loose
from
him
which
at
last
i
did
by
giving
a
violent
spring
which
threw
me
out
of
bed
on
the
floor
i
had
hurt
myself
sadly
by
the
fall
but
dragging
the
quilt
off
the
bed
after
me
i
wrapped
it
about
me
and
shrieked
louder
than
before
the
vile
man
tried
to
pacify
me
and
said
i
should
disturb
my
father
providentially
for
me
my
dear
father
had
not
gone
to
bed
for
his
room
was
a
great
way
from
mine
but
was
reading
in
the
study
which
was
over
my
he
had
heard
my
shrieks
from
the
first
but
little
dreaming
it
was
his
poor
daughter
voice
he
imagined
the
noise
was
in
the
street
and
had
lifted
up
the
sash
and
looked
out
to
try
whence
it
proceeded
finding
every
thing
quiet
without
doors
he
ran
down
stairs
and
was
led
by
my
cries
into
my
room
for
my
vile
persecutor
had
not
locked
the
door
very
well
knowing
none
of
his
own
people
could
dare
to
molest
him
and
he
did
not
think
my
cries
would
have
reached
my
ears
as
indeed
they
would
not
if
he
had
gone
to
bed
think
madam
what
my
poor
father
must
feel
when
he
saw
me
on
the
floor
for
i
was
not
able
to
rise
such
a
spectacle
of
horror
my
cap
was
off
and
my
nose
bleeding
with
the
fall
the
wretch
was
endeavouring
to
lift
me
up
and
i
trying
to
resist
him
good
god
defend
me
said
my
father
what
is
this
i
see
oh
sir
said
i
clinging
round
him
carry
me
out
of
the
house
carry
me
out
directly
from
this
monster
my
father
looked
aghast
you
do
not
mean
mr
ware
my
child
said
he
it
can
not
be
who
has
put
you
in
this
condition
mr
ware
quitted
the
room
the
minute
he
saw
my
father
which
was
not
till
i
catched
hold
of
him
for
he
had
his
back
to
the
door
and
i
suppose
was
in
too
much
agitation
to
hear
him
coming
in
my
poor
father
speechless
with
astonishment
took
me
into
his
arms
and
put
me
sitting
on
the
bed
then
stepping
into
my
closet
brought
out
a
bottle
of
water
some
of
which
he
made
me
drink
and
afterwards
washed
the
blood
from
my
face
which
he
soon
found
only
proceeded
from
my
having
hurt
my
nose
a
little
when
i
had
recovered
breath
enough
i
told
him
all
that
had
passed
his
despair
madam
is
not
to
be
described
he
tore
his
hair
and
was
like
a
madman
where
is
the
ungrateful
villain
said
he
i
will
go
this
minute
and
upbraid
him
with
his
treachery
he
ran
to
the
but
it
was
locked
on
the
outside
my
father
thus
prevented
from
going
out
had
time
to
cool
a
little
he
considered
it
would
to
be
no
purpose
to
reproach
a
powerful
tyrant
with
the
injuries
he
did
us
he
resolved
to
quit
the
inhospitable
house
as
soon
as
any
one
in
the
family
was
up
to
open
the
door
to
him
and
without
ever
seeing
his
face
again
commit
himself
to
providence
for
his
future
subsistence
it
would
have
been
happy
for
us
if
he
could
have
executed
this
design
but
the
profligate
man
prevented
us
we
spent
the
remainder
of
the
night
in
lamenting
our
misery
at
mr
ware
entered
the
room
in
his
for
i
suppose
he
had
gone
to
rest
after
he
left
us
he
told
my
father
he
was
sorry
for
what
had
passed
and
imputed
it
to
his
having
drunk
too
much
i
own
said
he
i
love
your
daughter
to
distraction
and
could
not
bear
the
thoughts
of
losing
her
as
i
found
you
resolved
to
go
out
of
town
so
suddenly
my
father
answered
i
will
not
reproach
you
as
i
ought
but
my
tender
care
of
your
youth
did
not
deserve
this
return
suffer
us
to
depart
out
of
your
house
and
you
shall
never
more
be
troubled
with
us
mr
ware
entreated
to
speak
with
my
father
by
himself
and
with
much
difficulty
prevailed
on
him
to
go
into
his
study
with
him
they
staid
together
near
half
an
hour
and
i
heard
them
talking
high
my
father
then
entered
my
room
with
tears
streaming
from
his
eyes
he
threw
himself
into
a
chair
in
an
agony
of
grief
the
villain
said
he
has
finished
his
work
he
has
stabbed
your
father
heart
i
ran
to
him
almost
frantic
i
thought
he
had
made
an
attempt
upon
his
life
when
i
found
he
was
not
hurt
i
asked
him
the
meaning
of
his
words
he
would
have
me
you
to
him
said
he
he
would
have
bribed
the
father
to
prostitute
his
child
oh
sir
said
i
why
do
we
stay
under
this
detested
roof
there
is
no
safety
for
us
here
said
he
come
my
dear
let
us
get
out
of
the
house
and
then
we
will
consider
which
way
we
are
to
turn
ourselves
my
father
laid
hold
of
my
hand
and
i
followed
him
just
as
i
was
in
my
morning
gown
we
thought
if
we
could
once
find
ourselves
in
the
street
we
should
be
happy
though
neither
of
us
knew
where
to
go
having
no
acquaintance
in
london
i
had
never
been
there
before
and
my
father
had
been
so
long
absent
that
he
was
forgotten
by
every
body
we
got
out
of
my
room
into
a
little
sort
of
but
found
the
door
of
that
fast
locked
we
now
gave
ourselves
up
for
lost
our
despair
is
not
to
be
expressed
we
sat
down
and
consulted
what
was
best
to
be
done
i
saw
now
that
there
was
nothing
that
our
base
persecutor
would
not
attempt
and
i
told
my
father
i
was
resolved
at
all
events
to
make
my
escape
he
said
that
the
shocking
wretch
had
given
him
till
the
next
day
to
consider
of
his
proposal
and
he
hoped
by
that
time
both
father
and
daughter
would
come
enough
to
their
senses
to
think
he
had
made
them
a
very
advantageous
offer
i
told
him
in
that
lucky
interval
i
hoped
to
be
able
to
affect
my
deliverance
which
i
thought
i
might
accomplish
with
his
assistance
by
tying
the
sheets
of
my
bed
together
and
so
from
the
window
sliding
into
the
street
we
were
both
pleased
with
this
expedient
but
the
next
thing
to
be
considered
was
what
place
i
should
go
to
as
i
could
not
make
this
attempt
till
late
at
night
and
must
go
alone
for
my
father
being
in
years
and
pretty
corpulent
i
could
not
think
of
letting
him
run
the
same
hazard
which
might
have
put
his
life
into
imminent
danger
especially
as
i
could
not
give
him
the
same
help
which
he
could
afford
me
this
was
a
difficulty
till
i
recollected
a
who
was
then
making
some
clothes
for
me
and
i
happened
to
know
where
she
lived
to
her
house
i
resolved
to
go
having
first
settled
all
my
previous
steps
and
to
remain
concealed
there
till
my
father
should
get
an
opportunity
of
coming
to
me
i
told
him
as
was
the
unhappy
object
on
whom
mr
ware
had
designs
i
supposed
he
would
not
detain
my
father
after
i
was
gone
he
shook
his
head
but
said
he
hoped
he
would
not
having
now
settled
our
little
plan
we
were
more
composed
a
servant
brought
breakfast
into
my
apartment
at
the
usual
hour
and
dinner
and
supper
in
the
like
manner
we
did
not
appear
troubled
but
as
carefully
avoided
seeming
chearful
for
fear
of
giving
suspicion
the
was
generally
the
last
person
up
in
the
family
so
that
i
was
either
to
seize
the
opportunity
before
she
came
up
to
my
room
or
wait
till
she
was
asleep
the
last
i
thought
was
the
securest
method
as
she
was
an
extremely
sound
sleeper
i
lifted
up
the
sash
in
the
to
be
in
readiness
and
closed
the
shutters
again
very
fortunately
my
father
having
received
his
quarterly
payment
from
mr
ware
just
before
we
came
to
town
had
fifty
guineas
in
his
purse
half
of
which
he
insisted
on
my
taking
in
case
of
any
emergency
about
twelve
the
came
into
the
room
where
we
were
sitting
as
she
was
obliged
to
pass
through
that
to
go
to
the
room
where
we
lay
we
heard
her
at
the
door
and
my
father
suddenly
changing
the
subject
of
our
discourse
made
me
a
sign
which
i
understood
and
as
the
woman
entered
affected
to
be
representing
to
me
the
charms
of
wealth
and
grandeur
whilst
i
seemed
to
listen
with
a
sort
of
pleasure
to
him
he
stopped
when
the
woman
came
in
but
not
till
he
was
sure
she
had
heard
what
he
said
for
we
observed
that
she
staid
at
the
outside
of
the
door
a
little
while
as
if
to
listen
to
our
conversation
on
seeing
us
engaged
in
discourse
she
made
a
motion
to
withdraw
saying
she
would
come
up
again
when
mr
price
was
retired
to
rest
but
i
told
her
she
might
if
she
pleased
then
go
to
bed
as
we
should
not
sit
up
long
but
as
i
suppose
she
had
orders
to
lock
me
in
after
my
father
had
left
me
she
did
not
chuse
to
do
this
she
said
she
was
not
sleepy
but
would
come
up
in
half
an
hour
and
left
the
room
smiling
this
was
an
opportunity
which
i
thought
was
not
to
be
lost
i
repaired
to
the
window
and
hearing
a
watchman
cry
the
hour
i
waited
till
he
came
under
it
and
having
prepared
a
piece
of
paper
in
which
i
had
put
a
weight
to
carry
it
down
i
lighted
it
and
dropped
it
at
his
feet
it
was
fastened
to
a
string
and
at
some
distance
from
it
above
was
fastened
another
large
piece
of
white
paper
folded
up
in
which
i
put
a
guinea
and
in
two
lines
written
in
a
large
plain
hand
beseeched
him
to
assist
me
in
getting
down
for
which
i
would
reward
him
with
another
guinea
the
lighted
paper
as
i
concluded
it
would
attracted
the
man
notice
he
stopped
and
took
it
up
and
finding
another
paper
hanging
to
the
string
looked
up
at
the
window
i
leaned
my
body
out
as
far
as
i
could
and
in
a
low
voice
but
loud
enough
for
him
to
hear
me
bid
him
read
it
he
opened
the
paper
and
by
the
light
of
his
own
lantern
read
the
lines
at
the
same
time
taking
out
the
guineas
which
i
could
perceive
he
also
examined
by
the
same
light
he
then
said
i
help
you
stay
a
little
he
made
what
haste
he
could
away
and
i
was
now
afraid
he
intended
to
leave
me
and
return
no
more
my
terror
was
inexpressible
during
the
man
absence
especially
as
several
people
in
that
interval
passed
by
however
he
soon
returned
with
a
companion
and
the
street
being
now
clear
i
saw
he
had
brought
a
sort
of
plank
or
board
under
his
arm
which
he
fixed
from
the
iron
pallisados
to
the
which
jutted
out
from
the
bottom
of
the
lower
windows
on
this
he
without
difficulty
mounted
and
being
now
much
nearer
to
me
he
told
me
he
would
receive
me
if
i
could
contrive
to
get
down
to
him
my
poor
father
hastily
kissed
and
blessed
me
and
having
my
apparatus
ready
for
descending
he
had
the
farther
precaution
to
fix
some
strong
ribbons
which
i
had
tied
together
for
the
purpose
under
my
arms
these
he
held
in
his
hands
whilst
i
slid
down
by
the
sheets
which
i
had
fastened
together
with
a
knot
the
trusty
watchman
caught
me
in
his
arms
and
lifted
me
over
the
pallisados
to
his
comrade
who
set
me
safely
down
in
the
street
it
was
very
dark
but
i
could
distinguish
when
my
father
drew
in
the
linen
and
heard
him
shut
the
window
i
then
told
my
deliverer
that
i
must
beg
a
farther
act
of
kindness
from
him
which
was
to
see
me
safe
to
the
street
where
i
wanted
to
go
he
readily
complied
and
leaving
it
to
his
comrade
to
carry
away
the
plank
took
me
under
the
arm
and
we
got
without
being
molested
to
the
house
the
family
were
all
in
bed
when
after
repeated
knocking
a
maid
looked
out
of
an
upper
window
and
asked
us
what
we
wanted
i
told
her
an
acquaintance
of
her
mistress
had
urgent
business
with
her
and
begged
she
would
step
down
and
speak
to
me
from
the
parlour
window
after
keeping
me
a
long
while
waiting
she
at
length
came
down
i
then
gave
the
watchman
the
other
guinea
i
had
promised
him
and
dismissed
him
very
well
pleased
with
his
night
adventure
after
he
was
gone
i
told
the
woman
my
name
and
begged
she
would
let
me
come
in
which
she
immediately
did
i
without
scruple
acquainted
her
with
the
manner
of
my
escape
and
the
occasion
of
it
she
was
shocked
and
affected
with
my
story
and
promised
to
keep
me
concealed
till
my
father
should
come
to
carry
me
to
some
place
of
greater
safety
for
she
said
as
mr
ware
was
her
acquaintance
i
might
be
discovered
at
her
house
this
terrified
me
exceedingly
but
the
woman
gave
me
the
most
solemn
assurances
that
i
should
be
safe
for
the
short
time
she
supposed
i
should
stay
with
her
she
invited
me
to
part
of
her
bed
as
she
told
me
she
had
never
a
spare
one
and
i
readily
accepted
of
her
offer
i
remained
all
the
next
day
in
the
utmost
grief
and
anxiety
at
hearing
nothing
from
my
poor
father
in
the
evening
of
the
second
day
a
porter
brought
a
letter
to
the
which
served
only
as
a
cover
for
a
note
directed
to
me
seeing
it
writ
in
my
father
hand
i
eagerly
opened
it
but
oh
madam
how
shall
i
tell
you
my
grief
and
horror
when
i
saw
it
dated
from
a
prison
my
poor
father
told
me
that
our
cruel
persecutor
enraged
at
my
escape
had
charged
my
father
with
it
who
immediately
acknowleged
he
had
assisted
in
delivering
me
from
ruin
that
mr
ware
after
treating
him
with
the
most
injurious
language
demanded
payment
of
him
for
the
sums
he
said
he
had
lent
him
from
time
to
time
since
his
father
death
to
this
my
father
making
no
other
reply
than
that
mr
ware
knew
he
had
it
not
in
his
power
to
refund
any
of
that
money
which
though
it
was
a
free
gift
he
would
restore
sooner
than
lie
under
any
obligation
to
such
a
base
man
the
villain
was
barbarous
enough
to
have
him
arrested
and
sent
to
jail
where
he
said
he
should
remain
till
his
stubborn
spirit
should
be
glad
to
yield
up
his
daughter
to
him
my
father
desired
me
to
come
to
him
directly
and
to
bring
some
body
with
me
to
protect
me
by
the
way
i
instantly
obeyed
and
sending
for
a
hackney
coach
the
got
her
husband
a
decent
tradesman
and
his
apprentice
to
accompany
me
we
drove
directly
to
my
poor
melancholy
habitation
where
they
delivered
me
safe
into
his
hands
his
joy
at
seeing
me
again
made
him
for
a
while
forget
the
sorrows
which
surrounded
us
he
told
me
that
after
he
had
seen
me
get
safe
into
the
street
and
had
recommended
me
to
the
care
of
providence
he
had
put
every
thing
out
of
the
way
which
had
assisted
me
in
my
escape
and
putting
out
one
of
the
candles
left
it
in
my
room
that
the
when
she
come
up
might
suppose
me
in
bed
he
then
went
to
his
own
he
concluded
that
the
woman
when
she
went
into
my
room
supposed
me
asleep
mr
ware
was
at
home
the
whole
evening
and
had
before
that
retired
to
rest
so
that
there
was
no
discovery
made
that
night
my
father
now
informed
me
that
mr
ware
had
said
when
he
first
made
the
odious
proposal
to
him
that
if
i
complied
he
would
allow
my
father
four
hundred
pounds
a
year
and
settle
the
like
sum
upon
me
for
life
at
the
same
time
in
case
of
refusal
insinuating
the
threat
which
he
afterwards
put
into
execution
thinking
no
doubt
he
should
by
this
intimidate
my
poor
father
so
much
that
upon
reflexion
he
would
use
his
endeavours
to
prevail
on
me
to
comply
and
it
was
for
this
wicked
purpose
he
was
permitted
or
rather
compelled
to
pass
the
whole
day
with
me
i
would
not
added
my
father
relate
this
particular
to
you
for
fear
your
tenderness
to
me
might
shake
your
virtue
but
the
trial
god
be
praised
is
now
past
you
are
here
my
poor
child
at
least
in
safety
we
have
some
money
to
support
us
for
a
while
perhaps
the
wicked
wretch
may
relent
if
he
gives
me
my
liberty
i
may
still
obtain
a
livelihood
and
if
i
can
get
you
received
into
some
worthy
family
that
will
protect
you
from
his
violence
i
shall
be
contented
my
father
unwilling
to
expose
his
ungrateful
pupil
and
thinking
when
he
cooled
a
little
he
would
be
ashamed
of
his
conduct
and
release
him
resolved
not
to
apprise
any
of
his
friends
in
berkshire
of
his
situation
but
wrote
a
long
expostulatory
letter
to
mr
ware
which
he
concluded
with
requesting
no
other
favour
but
his
liberty
to
this
mr
ware
wrote
in
answer
that
he
was
still
ready
to
make
good
his
first
proposals
and
since
he
now
found
that
he
had
got
his
daughter
with
him
he
should
obtain
his
liberty
on
no
other
terms
my
father
still
loath
to
believe
him
so
lost
to
humanity
as
to
persist
in
this
barbarous
resolution
patiently
waited
another
month
at
the
end
of
which
he
again
wrote
him
a
very
affecting
letter
but
to
this
he
received
no
answer
being
told
mr
ware
was
gone
into
berkshire
he
wrote
to
two
or
three
gentlemen
of
his
acquaintance
there
informing
them
of
his
deplorable
situation
and
begging
them
to
use
their
influence
with
mr
ware
on
his
behalf
he
did
not
disclose
the
enormity
of
his
behaviour
but
only
said
that
on
a
quarrel
he
had
with
him
he
had
confined
him
under
colour
of
a
debt
which
it
was
not
in
his
power
to
discharge
this
he
did
as
much
in
tenderness
to
mr
ware
character
as
to
avoid
exasperating
him
more
against
him
he
ordered
me
at
the
same
time
to
write
to
an
old
who
took
care
of
our
little
house
in
the
country
to
send
me
my
clothes
my
father
books
and
such
other
things
as
belonged
to
him
as
i
had
come
to
town
but
for
a
month
and
was
in
deep
mourning
for
my
mother
i
had
left
the
best
part
of
my
apparel
behind
me
and
i
had
taken
nothing
with
me
from
mr
ware
but
a
little
bundle
of
linnen
my
father
had
been
permitted
to
carry
his
with
him
to
the
prison
as
the
furniture
in
this
little
house
was
of
no
great
value
my
father
having
purchased
it
as
it
stood
in
the
house
of
the
former
curate
he
made
a
present
of
it
to
the
old
servant
who
had
lived
with
him
from
the
time
he
married
he
received
no
answer
to
any
of
the
letters
he
wrote
to
the
gentlemen
but
i
got
a
letter
from
this
old
servant
at
the
same
time
that
she
sent
the
things
which
i
wrote
for
and
you
will
scarce
believe
madam
to
what
a
height
this
abandoned
wretch
carried
his
crimes
not
contented
with
having
plunged
my
poor
father
and
me
into
the
deepest
distress
he
endeavoured
to
blast
and
destroy
our
characters
in
the
country
he
gave
out
that
my
father
taking
advantage
of
his
mr
ware
being
a
little
overcome
with
wine
one
night
had
put
his
daughter
to
bed
to
him
and
would
have
insisted
the
next
day
that
he
had
married
them
to
punish
the
ungrateful
designing
old
rogue
he
said
he
had
put
him
into
jail
where
he
intended
to
keep
him
a
month
or
two
till
he
repented
though
the
respectable
character
my
father
bore
in
his
neighbourhood
made
this
story
incredible
yet
mr
ware
power
and
influence
was
such
that
people
seemed
to
believe
it
and
applauded
mr
ware
clemency
in
my
father
punishment
no
wonder
then
his
letters
were
unanswered
they
were
shewn
to
mr
ware
and
laughed
at
the
old
servant
who
was
sure
we
were
both
cruelly
belied
lamented
our
unhappy
fate
but
poor
creature
she
could
do
nothing
lament
this
last
blow
quite
subdued
my
father
courage
he
fell
sick
upon
it
and
languished
many
weeks
in
a
most
melancholy
condition
when
he
recovered
a
little
from
his
sickness
he
was
suddenly
struck
with
the
dead
palsey
on
one
side
by
which
he
lost
the
use
of
his
right
hand
so
that
i
am
obliged
to
dress
and
undress
him
like
a
child
when
the
money
which
we
had
brought
with
us
to
the
prison
was
spent
we
were
obliged
to
sell
most
of
my
father
books
and
the
best
of
my
clothes
we
had
repeated
messages
from
the
merciless
man
by
his
vile
who
used
all
her
rhetoric
to
persuade
us
to
compliance
but
my
father
constantly
repulsed
her
with
contempt
and
indignation
at
length
mr
ware
tired
i
believe
with
persecuting
us
left
us
to
perish
in
peace
he
supposed
my
father
could
not
hold
out
long
and
he
then
concluded
i
should
be
at
his
mercy
for
as
i
never
stirred
out
of
the
jail
he
had
no
hopes
of
getting
me
into
his
power
whilst
my
poor
father
lived
if
i
had
even
a
place
of
refuge
to
go
to
i
could
not
think
of
leaving
him
in
the
wretched
hopeless
condition
to
which
he
was
now
reduced
i
thought
therefore
of
applying
myself
to
something
by
which
i
could
obtain
bread
for
our
support
i
set
about
making
those
little
artificial
flowers
which
had
formerly
been
one
of
my
amusements
and
a
woman
who
was
confined
in
the
same
prison
with
us
and
worked
for
some
shops
undertook
to
dispose
of
them
for
me
she
had
a
daughter
who
came
often
to
see
her
and
used
to
carry
her
work
and
mine
to
the
people
who
bespoke
it
in
this
manner
we
have
languished
madam
near
eighteen
months
when
hearing
lately
that
mr
ware
was
gone
to
bath
and
the
girl
who
used
to
visit
her
mother
being
sick
i
ventured
out
myself
with
the
work
the
person
who
employs
us
did
live
in
the
city
but
has
lately
taken
a
shop
in
this
street
and
though
it
is
a
journey
from
what
i
now
call
my
dismal
home
i
have
come
to
her
once
a
week
for
this
month
past
with
the
product
of
my
own
and
i
may
say
my
fellow
prisoner
labours
she
told
me
this
day
she
was
overstocked
with
such
flowers
as
i
brought
her
and
having
picked
out
a
few
of
the
best
of
them
she
left
those
which
you
see
in
my
upon
my
hands
i
was
returning
home
very
disconsolate
when
to
avoid
your
chariot
which
drew
up
close
to
the
house
i
stood
up
on
one
of
your
steps
not
knowing
it
was
going
to
stop
and
something
in
your
countenance
madam
i
know
not
how
encouraged
me
to
offer
my
little
ware
to
you
i
have
given
you
this
affecting
story
my
cecilia
pretty
nearly
in
the
girl
own
words
i
was
much
moved
by
it
if
this
be
all
fact
said
i
what
monsters
are
there
among
mankind
she
replied
it
was
all
very
true
though
the
girl
was
very
young
and
as
i
told
you
had
a
modest
and
ingenuous
look
yet
as
i
had
seen
such
cheating
faces
before
i
would
not
yield
up
my
belief
implicitly
this
story
might
be
invented
to
move
compassion
at
least
the
most
material
circumstances
of
it
and
though
i
could
not
suppose
she
had
contrived
it
on
the
spot
yet
i
did
not
know
but
it
might
have
been
contrived
for
her
i
have
a
mind
to
see
your
father
child
said
i
she
answered
quite
composed
then
madam
you
will
see
an
object
that
would
greatly
move
your
pity
she
rose
up
as
she
spoke
this
saying
her
poor
father
would
be
very
uneasy
at
her
staying
so
long
and
was
preparing
to
go
i
was
seized
with
a
strong
inclination
to
visit
this
unhappy
father
directly
if
said
i
the
case
be
as
she
represents
it
i
can
not
be
too
speedy
in
my
relief
and
if
she
has
falsified
in
any
thing
i
shall
probably
detect
her
by
not
giving
her
an
opportunity
of
seeing
and
preparing
him
first
it
was
not
more
than
eleven
and
i
resolved
not
to
defer
the
charity
i
intended
i
desired
the
young
woman
to
stay
a
while
and
ordering
patty
to
bring
down
a
plain
black
silk
hood
and
scarf
of
her
own
i
made
the
poor
girl
to
her
great
astonishment
put
them
on
i
then
ordered
a
hackney
coach
to
be
called
and
said
i
would
go
with
her
to
her
father
she
looked
surprized
but
not
startled
which
made
a
favourable
impression
on
me
she
appeared
decent
and
i
desired
her
to
get
into
the
coach
which
i
ordered
according
to
her
direction
to
drive
to
the
jail
where
her
father
was
confined
when
we
arrived
at
this
mansion
of
horror
for
so
it
appeared
to
me
i
let
her
go
up
stairs
before
me
she
stopped
at
a
door
and
said
that
was
the
room
where
her
father
lay
i
bid
her
go
in
first
she
entered
and
i
stood
the
door
where
as
the
lobby
was
dark
i
could
not
readily
be
perceived
i
saw
there
a
man
of
about
sixty
and
as
she
had
told
me
her
father
was
corpulent
i
did
not
at
first
take
him
to
be
the
person
for
he
looked
worn
out
pale
and
emaciated
he
wore
his
own
grisled
hair
and
had
on
a
cassock
girded
about
him
with
silk
sash
one
of
his
hands
was
slung
in
a
black
crape
he
sat
pensively
leaning
on
a
table
with
a
book
open
before
him
which
seemed
to
be
the
bible
upon
his
daughter
going
into
the
room
he
lifted
up
his
eyes
to
see
who
it
was
he
had
a
fine
countenance
candour
and
sincerity
were
painted
on
it
my
dear
you
made
a
long
stay
said
he
in
a
melancholy
voice
i
was
afraid
something
had
happened
to
you
what
has
detained
you
oh
sir
said
she
looking
towards
the
door
i
believe
i
met
with
a
good
angel
who
is
come
to
visit
you
in
prison
i
entered
at
these
words
the
venerable
man
a
good
angel
indeed
if
her
mind
be
like
her
face
he
bowed
respectfully
pray
sir
keep
your
seat
i
took
a
chair
and
placed
myself
by
him
he
did
not
seem
in
the
least
embarrassed
but
gravely
and
modestly
demanded
to
what
it
was
that
he
owed
the
honour
of
a
visit
from
a
lady
of
my
appearance
for
said
he
affluence
and
prosperity
seldom
seek
the
dwellings
of
the
wretched
i
informed
him
that
having
met
with
his
daughter
by
accident
she
had
given
me
a
melancholy
account
of
his
situation
and
that
i
wished
to
hear
the
particulars
from
his
own
mouth
he
made
an
apology
for
the
length
of
his
story
but
said
if
i
had
patience
he
would
relate
it
i
told
him
i
had
come
for
that
purpose
he
then
repeated
to
me
every
particular
as
i
had
before
heard
them
from
his
daughter
enlarging
on
certain
passages
which
she
had
but
slightly
touched
upon
he
shewed
me
copies
of
his
two
letters
to
mr
ware
and
that
gentleman
answer
to
the
first
as
also
the
old
servant
letter
to
his
daughter
which
convinced
me
of
the
truth
of
every
thing
he
had
said
i
asked
mr
price
what
mr
ware
demand
on
him
might
amount
to
he
said
four
hundred
pounds
which
was
what
he
had
received
from
him
since
his
father
death
take
courage
sir
said
i
you
shall
not
long
remain
here
ah
madam
cried
he
may
god
be
the
rewarder
of
your
goodness
but
my
enemy
is
a
hardened
man
he
is
not
to
be
influenced
by
honour
or
virtue
i
perceived
by
this
that
the
poor
gentleman
had
no
thought
of
my
paying
his
debt
but
supposed
i
would
endeavour
to
soften
mr
ware
on
his
account
have
a
little
patience
said
i
and
we
will
try
what
is
to
be
done
i
requested
he
would
give
me
mr
ware
letter
wherein
he
promised
to
make
good
his
first
proposal
if
he
would
consent
to
yield
up
his
daughter
to
him
i
took
my
leave
and
slipped
my
purse
which
had
ten
guineas
in
it
into
his
daughter
hand
as
i
went
down
stairs
as
soon
as
i
returned
home
i
sent
for
mr
warner
and
related
to
him
circumstantially
the
distresses
of
this
worthy
father
and
child
his
honest
indignation
burst
forth
against
the
base
betrayer
of
them
both
honest
i
must
call
it
though
he
vented
his
wrath
in
oaths
and
execrations
on
his
head
these
are
proper
objects
said
i
to
exercise
our
humanity
on
i
mean
to
pay
his
debt
and
make
the
remnant
of
his
days
comfortable
you
are
a
good
girl
said
he
you
know
my
purse
is
open
to
you
oh
sir
said
i
there
is
no
need
to
tax
your
generosity
upon
this
occasion
the
two
thousand
pounds
you
so
lately
gave
me
is
but
little
diminished
psha
psha
said
he
i
gave
you
that
to
make
ducks
and
drakes
of
it
is
not
to
go
into
the
account
you
know
your
income
is
commenced
you
may
have
what
you
will
i
begged
he
would
immediately
write
to
mr
ware
who
is
now
at
bath
and
make
him
a
tender
of
his
money
that
we
might
get
the
poor
man
discharged
from
confinement
as
soon
as
possible
i
gave
him
that
vile
fellow
letter
and
advised
him
to
let
him
know
that
he
was
acquainted
with
the
whole
truth
of
the
story
which
perhaps
might
frighten
him
into
better
terms
than
insisting
on
his
whole
demand
mr
warner
said
there
was
a
merchant
of
his
acquaintance
at
bristol
to
whom
he
would
write
immediately
and
order
him
to
pay
the
money
directly
if
it
was
insisted
on
he
said
he
knew
his
friend
would
readily
undertake
the
thing
and
execute
it
as
soon
as
possible
he
called
for
pen
ink
and
paper
and
wrote
before
me
the
following
letter
to
his
correspondent
which
as
he
left
it
with
me
to
seal
and
send
it
to
the
i
first
copied
sir
beg
immediately
on
the
receipt
of
this
you
will
take
the
trouble
of
riding
to
bath
and
there
enquire
for
a
man
of
fortune
one
ware
who
is
the
greatest
villain
in
england
and
you
may
tell
him
i
say
so
he
has
kept
a
poor
honest
clergyman
starving
in
jail
this
year
and
a
half
because
he
would
not
sell
his
daughter
to
him
he
pretends
the
parson
owes
him
four
hundred
pounds
which
is
a
lie
for
though
he
received
that
sum
from
him
it
was
paid
him
for
value
received
by
agreement
however
as
the
man
can
have
no
redress
i
request
you
would
immediately
tender
him
that
sum
and
get
a
discharge
for
i
will
have
the
poor
fellow
out
i
herewith
send
you
inclosed
a
letter
which
that
scoundrel
ware
wrote
pray
shew
it
to
him
as
a
token
that
the
parson
case
is
known
and
that
he
has
got
friends
to
stand
by
him
your
speedy
execution
of
this
affair
and
answer
will
oblige
friend
and
servant
warner
to
mr
william
blow
merchant
at
bristol
london
march
my
honest
kinsman
desired
i
would
immediately
send
this
letter
off
i
suppose
his
correspondent
will
have
more
discretion
than
to
let
mr
ware
see
the
contents
but
i
hope
we
shall
have
a
good
account
of
this
negotiation
i
have
been
very
impatient
my
cecilia
for
an
answer
to
mr
warner
odd
letter
and
this
day
he
received
one
his
friend
at
bristol
i
take
it
for
granted
acted
very
prudently
for
he
says
that
having
on
mr
ware
which
word
mr
warner
took
great
exceptions
to
he
acquainted
him
with
his
commission
and
at
the
same
time
produced
his
letter
to
mr
price
by
way
of
identifying
the
person
as
mr
ware
at
first
seemed
not
to
recollect
any
thing
of
the
matter
he
said
mr
ware
blushed
upon
seeing
his
own
letter
in
the
hands
of
a
stranger
aye
i
remember
the
silly
affair
now
said
he
the
man
is
an
old
hypocrite
and
his
daughter
is
a
young
one
but
as
i
never
meant
to
ruin
him
i
will
forgive
him
the
debt
and
accordingly
wrote
a
full
acquittal
which
the
merchant
transmitted
with
his
answer
nothing
now
remained
but
to
pay
the
usual
fees
and
get
the
poor
old
gentleman
out
as
fast
as
we
could
mr
warner
undertook
to
do
what
was
proper
on
the
occasion
and
instantly
set
out
it
with
an
alacrity
that
shewed
the
goodness
of
his
heart
how
wonderfully
shame
operates
on
some
minds
this
wretched
man
ware
whom
neither
the
laws
of
god
nor
man
could
restrain
has
by
this
single
passion
alone
been
subdued
he
found
his
base
conduct
was
known
by
people
whom
he
could
not
impose
on
and
his
forgiving
the
pretended
debt
no
doubt
was
meant
as
a
bribe
to
prevent
his
disgrace
from
being
propagated
for
though
he
could
sit
down
and
enjoy
himself
under
the
accumulated
guilt
of
fraud
perfidy
cruelty
oppression
and
ingratitude
he
was
not
proof
against
the
reproach
and
ridicule
of
the
world
this
shews
at
least
that
he
was
not
long
practised
in
crimes
of
this
sort
i
did
not
see
mr
warner
again
till
this
morning
when
he
entered
my
room
making
flourishes
with
his
hands
mr
price
and
his
daughter
were
with
him
here
they
are
for
you
said
he
and
it
has
done
my
heart
good
to
deliver
such
honest
people
from
their
misery
the
good
old
man
poured
forth
such
fervent
prayers
and
thanks
for
my
goodness
towards
them
that
my
heart
exulted
with
rapture
at
being
the
means
of
conferring
such
happiness
as
this
worthy
parent
and
child
seemed
to
enjoy
the
young
girl
gratitude
was
silent
but
not
less
ardent
than
her
father
she
had
kneeled
down
before
me
and
kissed
my
hands
i
was
greatly
touched
with
the
humility
and
tenderness
of
her
acknowlegement
i
put
an
end
to
the
grateful
effusions
of
these
honest
hearts
i
have
done
but
little
for
you
said
i
as
yet
as
mr
ware
had
the
grace
to
refuse
the
offered
sum
i
shall
apply
that
money
which
i
intended
for
him
to
your
future
use
or
your
liberty
will
avail
you
but
little
we
shall
think
of
some
method
of
settling
you
comfortably
for
life
in
the
mean
while
your
daughter
and
you
shall
be
welcome
to
live
with
me
i
stopped
him
from
renewing
his
thanks
and
insisted
on
his
saying
no
more
on
that
subject
the
poor
old
gentleman
is
extremely
feeble
and
languishing
from
his
long
confinement
but
i
hope
with
proper
care
as
he
is
naturally
strong
he
will
recover
his
health
what
true
delight
springs
from
benevolent
actions
my
dear
i
never
expected
such
satisfaction
as
i
have
received
from
restoring
comfort
to
these
truly
deserving
people
i
have
bought
the
young
lady
some
new
clothes
plain
but
genteel
and
you
can
not
imagine
what
a
pretty
creature
she
is
now
she
is
dressed
i
find
the
old
gentleman
a
man
of
admirable
understanding
and
great
reading
he
has
a
simplicity
in
his
manner
that
is
truly
engaging
but
at
the
same
time
a
politeness
that
shews
he
is
no
stranger
to
the
great
world
of
his
integrity
he
has
given
convincing
proofs
praised
be
the
lord
who
has
made
me
and
honest
mr
warner
the
instruments
of
delivering
such
a
man
from
the
depths
of
affliction
he
mends
apace
in
his
health
but
i
am
afraid
he
will
never
recover
the
use
of
his
hand
though
as
it
is
not
painful
it
seems
not
to
give
him
any
i
am
infinitely
charmed
with
the
conversation
of
this
couple
for
the
girl
is
very
sensible
and
prettily
accomplished
i
wish
she
were
married
to
some
honest
man
that
knew
her
value
for
i
find
she
has
still
terrors
on
mr
ware
account
nor
is
her
father
without
his
apprehensions
he
said
to
me
if
i
were
to
die
madam
i
would
conjure
you
as
my
last
request
to
take
my
daughter
into
your
service
with
such
a
pattern
before
her
she
must
be
virtuous
and
with
such
a
protector
i
am
sure
she
would
be
safe
i
told
him
he
might
rely
on
me
but
that
i
hoped
he
would
live
long
enough
to
see
her
happily
disposed
of
in
marriage
if
i
could
see
that
day
said
he
i
should
then
have
no
other
worldly
care
to
disturb
me
here
my
dearest
cecilia
i
will
close
my
very
long
narrative
the
pacquet
is
already
swelled
to
an
enormous
size
but
you
never
think
them
too
large
after
so
many
trifles
my
dear
as
my
journal
for
nearly
a
month
past
contained
you
will
be
glad
of
something
a
little
more
serious
i
mentioned
in
my
last
week
journal
that
i
had
cast
my
eyes
on
a
young
man
who
i
thought
would
make
a
suitable
match
for
miss
price
if
he
were
approved
of
by
her
and
her
father
this
person
is
a
in
the
strand
a
second
brother
of
my
patty
you
ca
have
forgot
harry
main
my
dear
whom
we
both
knew
as
a
boy
remarkable
for
his
sober
behaviour
modesty
and
sweetness
of
temper
he
is
just
now
out
of
his
time
and
his
eldest
brother
has
set
him
up
in
a
handsome
shop
you
may
be
sure
i
am
his
customer
is
on
this
lad
then
that
i
have
turned
my
thoughts
as
a
fit
husband
for
the
amiable
girl
i
went
yesterday
morning
to
buy
some
linen
for
miss
price
and
carried
her
with
me
as
i
had
done
once
or
twice
before
after
we
made
our
markets
i
told
young
main
with
a
freedom
which
a
long
acquaintance
gave
me
that
i
thought
he
was
so
well
settled
he
wanted
nothing
but
a
good
wife
to
complete
his
happiness
he
replied
he
should
think
himself
very
happy
if
he
could
light
on
some
good
young
woman
as
a
partner
for
life
why
do
you
not
look
out
for
one
said
i
they
are
not
so
hard
to
be
come
at
i
believe
madam
he
answered
i
must
get
some
one
else
to
do
it
for
me
my
friends
laugh
at
me
and
say
i
am
too
bashful
to
speak
for
myself
but
i
fancy
were
i
to
meet
with
a
person
that
really
touched
my
heart
i
should
make
a
shift
to
find
courage
enough
to
tell
her
so
and
have
you
never
yet
seen
such
a
person
said
i
he
blushed
and
by
an
involuntary
motion
his
eyes
were
turned
on
miss
price
of
whom
i
concluded
his
sister
patty
as
she
often
visits
him
had
given
him
the
history
he
said
if
i
commanded
him
to
tell
his
secret
i
should
know
it
another
time
this
was
enough
i
asked
in
a
jocose
way
would
he
take
a
wife
of
my
chusing
sooner
than
of
any
body
in
the
world
madam
he
replied
we
took
our
leave
and
i
asked
patty
when
i
went
home
whether
she
had
ever
mentioned
any
thing
about
miss
price
to
her
brother
poor
patty
coloured
for
fear
she
had
committed
a
fault
but
owned
directly
she
had
told
him
every
circumstance
of
her
story
her
brother
having
been
very
inquisitive
about
her
from
the
first
time
he
had
seen
her
with
me
and
added
that
she
believed
he
was
in
love
with
her
i
told
her
if
miss
price
liked
her
brother
and
her
father
did
not
disapprove
the
match
i
saw
no
reason
why
they
might
not
make
each
other
happy
as
i
should
give
miss
price
a
fortune
worth
a
young
acceptance
patty
said
she
was
sure
her
brother
would
rejoice
at
the
offer
and
that
she
herself
could
not
wish
him
to
make
a
better
choice
it
only
remained
now
to
know
how
the
young
lady
herself
stood
affected
towards
him
i
put
patty
for
whom
miss
price
had
conceived
a
great
affection
upon
this
task
i
thought
she
would
speak
her
mind
with
less
reserve
to
her
as
i
feared
the
obligation
she
thought
herself
under
to
me
might
have
such
an
influence
on
her
gratitude
as
to
prevent
that
freedom
which
i
wished
her
to
use
for
i
was
resolved
not
to
put
the
least
shadow
of
constraint
on
her
inclinations
patty
succeeded
so
well
that
without
seeming
to
have
any
design
in
it
she
drew
a
confession
from
miss
price
very
much
in
her
brother
favour
being
now
sure
that
the
young
people
liked
each
other
i
thought
i
might
open
my
design
to
the
old
gentleman
which
i
did
in
few
words
how
the
good
man
was
delighted
with
the
happy
prospect
which
his
daughter
had
before
her
he
has
left
the
affair
intirely
to
me
so
that
i
hope
to
have
the
girl
disposed
of
very
much
to
all
our
satisfaction
i
am
charmed
with
mr
warner
noble
behaviour
i
claim
an
interest
said
he
in
these
honest
creatures
that
you
have
taken
under
your
protection
i
like
the
old
fellow
mightily
and
admire
the
little
girl
so
much
that
if
you
had
not
provided
a
better
husband
for
her
i
should
have
been
half
tempted
to
have
taken
her
myself
but
since
it
is
as
it
is
we
must
do
handsomely
by
her
i
told
him
i
had
enquired
into
the
young
man
circumstances
and
found
that
about
a
thousand
pounds
would
set
him
forward
extremely
well
and
that
this
was
the
portion
i
intended
to
give
him
with
the
young
gentlewoman
well
said
he
i
believe
that
will
do
but
i
must
make
the
poor
thing
a
present
myself
for
and
the
old
man
too
must
we
not
take
care
of
him
dear
sir
said
i
how
good
you
are
you
would
remind
me
of
my
duty
if
i
myself
were
forgetful
of
it
but
i
have
already
settled
a
hundred
pounds
a
year
on
him
is
that
enough
said
he
will
it
make
the
good
fellow
easy
oh
sir
it
exceeds
his
wishes
he
intends
to
live
with
his
daughter
as
his
growing
infirmities
require
her
tender
care
every
thing
is
to
be
this
day
settled
mr
price
is
exceedingly
pleased
with
his
elect
and
the
wedding
will
be
no
longer
delayed
than
till
mr
main
receives
the
answer
to
those
letters
which
he
has
wrote
to
his
friends
in
the
country
to
apprize
them
of
his
approaching
marriage
i
am
sure
my
dear
cecilia
will
rejoice
with
her
friend
in
the
acquisition
she
has
received
to
her
own
happiness
by
conferring
so
much
on
a
worthy
family
the
bride
is
this
day
gone
home
to
her
own
house
her
delighted
father
with
her
their
prayers
and
blessings
poured
out
from
truly
grateful
and
virtuous
hearts
remain
with
me
a
reward
my
dear
and
a
rich
one
too
for
the
part
i
have
acted
my
worthy
patty
whose
merit
alone
raises
her
much
above
her
station
i
shall
no
longer
consider
as
my
servant
she
has
been
my
friend
in
the
tenderest
and
most
enlarged
sense
of
the
word
and
she
shall
continue
so
i
have
hired
another
maid
to
wait
on
me
and
with
a
sort
of
merry
ceremony
enfranchised
patty
on
the
day
of
her
brother
marriage
for
i
had
her
dressed
elegantly
as
bride
maid
to
her
new
sister
and
she
sat
on
her
at
the
wedding
dinner
i
look
on
her
as
my
companion
but
i
can
not
persuade
her
to
forget
that
i
was
her
mistress
she
shews
this
by
actions
not
by
words
here
follows
an
interval
of
thirteen
months
in
which
nothing
material
to
the
thread
of
the
story
occurs
the
journal
contains
only
a
continued
series
of
such
actions
as
shewed
the
noble
and
pious
use
which
mrs
arnold
made
of
the
great
fortune
which
providence
had
blessed
her
with
the
rest
is
filled
up
with
a
variety
of
little
incidents
many
of
them
relative
to
her
brother
and
his
lady
to
mr
warner
and
several
letters
from
lady
v
with
whom
she
constantly
corresponded
at
the
end
of
that
period
the
journal
proceeds
thus
and
shall
i
really
be
so
blessed
my
ever
beloved
cecilia
as
to
see
you
at
the
time
you
mention
oh
my
dear
after
an
absence
of
five
long
years
how
my
heart
bounds
with
joy
at
your
approach
the
two
months
that
are
to
intervene
before
we
meet
will
appear
very
tedious
to
me
but
it
is
always
so
with
happiness
that
is
within
our
view
before
i
expected
you
though
i
regretted
your
absence
yet
did
i
patiently
acquiesce
under
it
and
could
entertain
my
thoughts
with
other
objects
but
i
am
now
i
can
not
tell
you
how
anxious
and
impatient
to
see
you
and
yet
my
cecilia
we
shall
have
nothing
new
to
say
to
each
other
knowing
as
we
both
do
every
circumstance
of
each
other
life
since
we
parted
mine
has
been
a
strange
one
but
my
lot
is
now
fallen
on
a
fair
ground
where
i
hope
it
will
please
heaven
to
continue
me
whilst
i
am
to
remain
in
this
world
the
noble
i
may
almost
call
it
princely
fortune
that
my
kinsman
has
settled
on
me
will
enable
me
to
leave
my
children
greatly
provided
for
whenever
it
shall
be
god
pleasure
to
call
me
away
let
me
but
live
to
embrace
my
cecilia
and
then
providence
thy
will
be
done
gracious
god
for
what
i
am
yet
reserved
my
trembling
hand
can
scarce
hold
my
pen
but
i
will
try
to
tell
you
the
event
which
yesterday
produced
i
was
but
just
set
down
to
dinner
nobody
with
me
but
patty
and
my
children
a
note
was
brought
into
me
which
they
said
came
by
a
porter
who
waited
for
an
answer
i
opened
and
read
it
my
eyes
were
struck
with
the
unlooked
for
name
of
orlando
faulkland
at
the
bottom
the
contents
filled
me
with
terror
and
surprize
i
know
not
what
i
have
done
with
the
note
but
he
informed
me
in
it
that
he
was
just
arrived
in
town
and
begged
i
would
appoint
an
hour
that
evening
to
see
him
alone
adding
that
his
arrival
was
and
must
be
a
secret
to
every
body
but
me
troubled
and
shocked
as
i
was
i
returned
for
answer
by
the
same
messenger
that
i
should
expect
him
at
six
i
need
not
tell
you
how
i
passed
the
interval
that
hour
it
was
impossible
for
me
amidst
a
thousand
conjectures
to
form
one
which
could
probably
occasion
this
amazing
visit
so
strangely
introduced
so
unthought
of
and
from
one
i
imagined
to
be
in
another
kingdom
precisely
at
six
i
heard
a
coach
stop
at
the
door
patty
was
in
the
way
to
receive
him
and
presently
mr
faulkland
himself
entered
the
distraction
was
in
his
looks
i
rose
to
receive
him
but
shook
from
head
to
foot
and
i
felt
the
blood
forsaking
my
face
he
ran
to
me
as
if
with
a
design
to
salute
me
but
started
back
without
making
the
offer
i
made
a
motion
to
a
chair
for
him
and
sat
down
myself
for
i
was
not
able
to
stand
you
are
welcome
to
england
sir
i
am
glad
to
see
you
scarce
knowing
what
i
said
i
hope
your
lady
is
well
he
looked
wildly
as
if
in
horror
at
the
question
then
suddenly
catching
both
my
hands
he
fell
on
his
knees
before
me
his
eyes
fixed
mournfully
on
my
face
and
it
was
some
time
before
he
could
answer
i
could
not
speak
i
burst
into
tears
there
was
something
dreadful
in
his
silence
he
kissed
both
my
hands
but
i
withdrew
them
from
him
sir
sir
speak
i
conjure
you
you
shock
me
to
death
i
see
i
have
said
he
and
i
am
afraid
to
proceed
you
will
die
at
the
relation
for
sake
sir
explain
you
see
a
man
said
he
whose
life
is
forfeited
to
the
law
my
wife
is
dead
and
by
my
hand
i
do
know
whether
he
said
more
for
i
fainted
away
it
seems
he
did
not
call
for
any
help
but
by
his
own
endeavours
at
last
brought
me
to
myself
and
i
found
him
weeping
bitterly
over
me
the
sound
of
the
last
horrid
words
i
had
heard
him
speak
still
rung
in
my
ears
i
begged
him
to
explain
them
that
wife
said
he
that
woman
whom
persuaded
me
to
marry
i
caught
in
adultery
and
i
punished
the
villain
who
had
wronged
me
with
death
she
shared
in
his
fate
though
without
my
intending
it
for
this
act
of
justice
which
the
law
will
deem
murder
i
myself
must
die
and
i
am
come
but
to
take
a
last
what
recompence
then
can
you
make
the
man
whom
you
have
brought
to
misery
shame
and
death
his
looks
and
the
tone
of
voice
with
which
he
spoke
this
made
my
blood
run
cold
and
my
heart
die
within
me
i
wrung
my
hands
and
redoubling
my
tears
i
do
not
need
your
reproaches
said
i
to
make
me
the
most
miserable
woman
on
earth
what
recompence
indeed
i
make
you
none
none
but
to
tell
you
that
if
you
will
fly
this
instant
my
fortune
will
be
at
your
disposal
and
i
will
take
care
to
supply
you
in
what
part
soever
of
the
world
you
shall
chuse
for
your
residence
and
can
you
after
all
that
is
past
said
he
persist
in
such
barbarity
as
to
drive
me
from
you
or
are
you
determined
to
see
me
perish
here
if
that
be
so
i
will
soon
rid
you
of
this
miserable
hated
wretch
he
drew
his
sword
like
a
madman
and
with
a
dreadful
imprecation
which
made
me
shudder
swore
that
if
i
did
not
that
minute
promise
to
bear
him
company
in
his
flight
he
would
plunge
it
into
his
breast
and
die
before
my
good
god
what
a
scene
of
horror
was
this
i
will
i
will
i
cried
i
will
go
with
you
to
the
farthest
verge
of
the
earth
i
catched
his
arm
fell
down
on
my
knees
and
was
more
mad
if
possible
than
himself
i
begged
of
him
to
put
up
his
sword
which
he
did
seeing
me
almost
dead
with
fear
you
know
said
he
the
means
of
dying
are
always
in
my
own
power
take
care
you
do
not
trifle
with
me
nor
plead
in
excuse
for
falsifying
your
promise
that
you
made
it
to
save
me
from
immediate
destruction
i
beseeched
him
to
calm
himself
a
little
and
to
permit
me
to
send
for
my
brother
sir
george
you
know
has
an
intire
affection
for
you
said
i
you
may
trust
him
with
your
life
in
safety
i
had
forgot
him
said
he
poor
bidulph
he
will
be
afflicted
when
he
hears
my
story
i
instantly
wrote
a
line
to
my
brother
requesting
to
see
him
immediately
by
good
fortune
he
was
home
and
came
to
me
directly
in
the
mean
time
as
i
saw
mr
faulkland
mind
was
exceedingly
disturbed
i
endeavoured
by
giving
him
an
account
of
my
own
situation
to
divert
his
thoughts
from
the
trouble
that
preyed
on
them
for
i
was
apprehensive
of
his
relapsing
into
the
same
phrenzy
that
had
so
much
terrified
me
if
i
touched
on
the
cause
and
therefore
chose
to
defer
enquiring
into
the
particulars
of
his
misfortune
till
my
brother
should
be
present
sir
george
was
equally
astonished
with
me
at
the
sight
of
mr
faulkland
they
embraced
tenderly
poor
mr
faulkland
wept
upon
my
brother
neck
it
was
easy
to
discover
he
laboured
under
some
extraordinary
affliction
my
brother
looked
at
me
as
if
for
an
explanation
he
seemed
to
guess
at
least
part
of
the
fatal
truth
are
you
come
to
england
alone
faulkland
said
he
i
prevented
the
reply
he
is
alone
said
i
he
has
a
dreadful
story
to
relate
to
you
mrs
faulkland
is
dead
i
durst
not
ask
the
manner
of
her
death
till
you
were
by
to
calm
the
transports
of
your
friend
my
heart
forebodes
answered
my
brother
addressing
himself
to
mr
faulkland
that
the
ungrateful
woman
you
married
has
betrayed
you
she
did
replied
mr
faulkland
but
i
did
not
mean
to
stain
my
hands
with
her
blood
perfidious
as
she
was
her
death
be
on
her
own
head
sir
george
looked
astonished
that
she
is
dead
i
rejoice
said
he
but
how
my
dear
faulkland
were
you
accessary
to
it
we
were
that
instant
interrupted
mr
warner
passing
by
called
to
ask
me
how
i
did
and
as
my
brother
chariot
stood
at
the
door
i
could
not
be
denied
to
him
though
i
had
ordered
that
nobody
should
be
let
in
i
was
called
down
to
him
and
indeed
was
not
sorry
to
have
an
excuse
for
absenting
myself
a
while
for
my
spirits
were
quite
overpowered
mr
warner
quickly
observed
that
something
extraordinary
had
happened
and
as
he
was
already
acquainted
with
the
greatest
part
of
mr
faulkland
history
some
particulars
relative
to
his
wife
excepted
i
made
no
scruple
relying
on
his
prudence
and
secrecy
of
telling
him
the
cause
of
my
present
distress
in
which
he
seemed
to
take
a
friendly
and
even
paternal
share
when
he
was
gone
i
returned
to
the
room
where
i
had
left
my
brother
and
his
friend
they
both
seemed
in
extreme
agitation
they
were
walking
about
this
is
an
unfortunate
affair
said
my
brother
and
may
be
attended
with
dreadful
consequences
if
faulkland
does
not
shew
more
regard
to
his
own
safety
than
he
seems
inclined
to
do
i
have
been
persuading
him
to
retire
to
a
place
which
i
can
provide
for
him
where
he
may
lye
concealed
for
a
day
or
two
till
he
is
recovered
from
the
fatigue
of
his
journey
for
he
has
travelled
night
and
day
for
these
three
days
without
sleeping
sir
george
looked
at
me
and
by
a
sorrowful
sign
which
he
made
i
apprehended
he
feared
his
unhappy
friend
head
was
disturbed
for
heaven
sake
sir
said
i
be
advised
by
my
brother
who
loves
you
suffer
him
to
conduct
you
to
some
place
of
security
when
you
have
had
a
little
repose
we
will
both
come
to
you
and
concert
such
measures
as
shall
be
best
for
your
safety
he
snatched
my
hand
sir
george
is
my
true
friend
said
he
take
care
that
you
do
not
deceive
me
i
find
myself
giddy
for
want
of
rest
i
am
satisfied
to
be
disposed
of
for
how
you
please
but
give
me
your
word
of
honour
that
i
shall
see
you
in
the
morning
you
shall
indeed
sir
i
replied
depend
upon
it
answered
sir
george
i
bring
her
to
you
myself
he
looked
irresolute
and
as
if
he
knew
not
what
to
say
then
turning
to
my
brother
and
leaning
on
his
shoulder
do
dear
bidulph
carry
me
to
some
place
where
i
may
lie
down
for
my
spirits
can
hold
out
no
longer
come
said
sir
george
taking
him
under
the
arm
my
chariot
is
at
the
door
i
will
bring
you
to
a
house
where
you
may
be
quiet
at
home
mr
faulkland
rivetted
his
eyes
on
me
as
my
brother
led
him
out
of
the
room
but
he
did
not
speak
sir
george
whispered
me
that
he
would
return
again
they
went
into
the
chariot
together
and
drove
away
it
was
ten
before
my
brother
returned
he
told
me
he
had
lodged
mr
faulkland
safely
at
a
friend
house
in
whom
he
could
confide
as
he
did
not
think
his
own
in
case
of
a
search
a
place
of
security
he
said
he
had
seen
him
in
bed
and
hoped
a
little
sleep
would
compose
his
mind
which
seemed
very
much
disturbed
i
requested
my
brother
to
give
me
the
particulars
of
that
terrible
affair
which
mr
faulkland
had
mentioned
sir
george
related
to
me
what
follows
though
mr
faulkland
he
said
told
the
story
but
incoherently
mr
faulkland
said
he
had
no
reason
to
be
displeased
with
his
conduct
for
more
than
a
year
after
their
marriage
her
affection
for
him
seemed
lively
and
sincere
and
he
had
made
her
the
most
grateful
returns
it
being
the
study
of
his
life
to
render
her
happy
her
love
abated
not
of
its
ardor
and
he
had
all
the
reason
in
the
world
to
imagine
himself
intirely
possessed
of
her
heart
whilst
mr
faulkland
house
in
the
country
was
building
he
had
been
invited
by
a
neighbouring
gentleman
who
lived
at
the
distance
of
about
three
miles
from
his
own
place
to
stay
at
his
house
which
obliging
offer
mr
faulkland
had
readily
accepted
as
by
that
means
he
had
daily
opportunities
of
seeing
and
expediting
his
own
improvements
mr
bond
that
was
the
gentleman
name
had
a
wife
and
two
or
three
daughters
all
very
agreeable
women
with
whom
mrs
faulkland
had
by
living
so
much
in
their
family
contracted
a
great
intimacy
but
particularly
with
the
eldest
a
sprightly
fine
young
woman
of
about
twenty
years
old
they
had
been
three
or
four
months
at
mr
bonds
their
house
which
was
nothing
more
than
a
little
lodge
was
finished
and
they
only
waited
till
it
was
thoroughly
dry
to
remove
into
it
as
mr
faulkland
had
laid
out
extensive
gardens
in
the
finishing
of
which
he
proposed
to
amuse
himself
some
time
for
he
acknowleged
to
my
brother
he
was
in
no
haste
to
return
to
england
during
their
residence
with
this
gentleman
they
had
made
two
or
three
excursions
to
town
on
their
return
from
one
of
these
after
an
absence
of
about
a
fortnight
they
found
a
visitor
at
mr
bond
his
name
was
smyth
he
was
an
officer
a
genteel
handsome
man
and
they
were
given
to
understand
he
made
his
addresses
to
the
eldest
daughter
of
whom
he
had
been
an
admirer
a
long
time
but
durst
not
make
his
pretensions
known
to
her
father
till
having
lately
been
promoted
in
the
army
to
the
rank
of
a
major
the
young
lady
parents
admitted
his
visits
to
their
daughter
she
had
long
before
that
acknowleged
to
mrs
faulkland
in
confidence
her
attachment
to
him
mr
faulkland
who
had
learned
this
secret
from
his
wife
was
very
glad
to
find
that
miss
bond
for
whom
he
had
great
esteem
was
likely
to
have
her
wishes
accomplished
as
he
saw
that
major
smyth
was
treated
with
distinction
by
her
parents
who
complimented
him
with
a
bed
at
their
house
for
he
generally
staid
two
or
three
nights
with
them
every
time
he
paid
them
a
visit
as
his
regiment
was
then
quartered
at
a
town
about
fifteen
miles
distant
from
their
house
the
major
without
being
a
man
of
very
shining
parts
had
such
talents
as
made
him
acceptable
to
the
women
he
sung
prettily
was
lively
to
extravagance
full
of
agreeable
trifling
and
always
in
good
humour
miss
bond
loved
him
and
as
he
was
considered
in
the
light
of
a
person
who
would
shortly
be
one
of
the
family
mr
faulkland
soon
contracted
a
friendship
with
him
which
the
major
on
his
part
seemed
very
solicitous
to
improve
the
marriage
was
now
agreed
on
and
was
only
deferred
till
the
young
lady
brother
should
be
at
age
as
he
was
to
join
with
his
father
in
making
a
settlement
on
his
sister
this
desirable
event
was
at
the
distance
of
four
months
but
as
the
lover
was
in
the
mean
time
permitted
to
enjoy
so
much
of
his
mistress
conversation
he
seemed
to
submit
to
the
delay
with
patience
things
were
in
this
situation
when
mr
faulkland
thinking
it
time
to
remove
to
his
own
house
proposed
it
to
his
lady
but
she
objected
to
it
declaring
she
did
not
think
it
safe
as
the
house
had
been
so
lately
built
though
indeed
it
was
now
perfectly
well
seasoned
for
the
shell
had
been
intirely
finished
some
time
before
mr
faulkland
had
gone
to
mr
bond
house
and
it
was
only
the
inside
work
and
a
kitchen
that
was
built
apart
from
the
lodge
that
wanted
to
be
completed
mr
faulkland
was
unwilling
to
oppose
his
lady
in
any
thing
but
he
was
the
more
solicitous
that
she
should
comply
with
his
request
in
this
particular
as
he
thought
he
had
observed
that
the
eldest
miss
bond
had
of
late
behaved
with
more
coldness
towards
her
than
usual
though
he
was
far
from
guessing
the
cause
of
this
he
thought
it
however
a
sufficient
reason
for
their
removal
he
was
afraid
they
had
already
staid
too
long
and
that
perhaps
notwithstanding
the
good
nature
and
hospitality
of
the
family
they
all
now
secretly
wished
their
absence
this
though
he
intended
to
make
a
suitable
return
for
their
friendly
reception
of
him
during
so
long
a
time
made
him
resolve
not
to
continue
there
and
the
more
so
as
miss
bond
who
was
present
when
he
proposed
it
to
mrs
faulkland
seemed
to
wish
for
their
departure
as
she
dissented
from
that
lady
with
regard
to
her
opinion
of
the
state
of
the
new
house
and
seemed
to
think
there
could
no
danger
attend
their
immediate
entrance
into
it
mrs
faulkland
seemed
nettled
at
this
and
immediately
assented
to
her
husband
proposal
the
next
day
they
took
their
leave
of
mr
bond
family
and
repaired
to
their
own
house
mr
faulkland
from
this
period
remarked
a
change
in
his
behaviour
she
grew
melancholy
and
peevish
but
as
she
complained
of
not
being
well
he
imputed
the
alteration
in
her
temper
to
that
alone
and
the
more
so
as
she
did
not
abate
in
the
tokens
of
her
seeming
affection
for
him
mr
bond
family
frequently
visited
them
major
smyth
always
made
one
of
the
party
and
often
came
without
them
though
they
lived
but
at
the
distance
of
three
miles
from
each
other
yet
as
the
road
for
carriages
between
the
two
houses
being
one
was
very
bad
the
ladies
were
often
prevailed
on
if
they
staid
late
to
lye
a
night
at
mr
faulkland
and
in
consequence
of
this
mr
bond
and
the
major
had
frequently
done
the
same
when
they
were
of
the
party
though
mr
faulkland
was
far
from
having
any
injurious
suspicion
of
his
wife
he
could
not
help
observing
that
all
her
complaints
vanished
whenever
this
family
were
at
her
house
this
however
he
ascribed
to
nothing
more
than
her
being
fond
of
the
company
though
he
thought
a
coolness
between
her
and
the
eldest
miss
bond
was
still
apparent
the
principals
of
the
family
however
behaved
with
their
usual
frankness
and
and
mr
faulkland
thought
there
might
be
some
little
female
pique
between
the
two
ladies
which
was
not
worth
enquiring
into
as
they
punctually
returned
the
friendly
visits
of
these
agreeable
neighbours
mrs
faulkland
always
proposed
passing
the
night
there
to
induce
them
as
she
said
to
use
the
same
obliging
freedom
at
her
house
mr
faulkland
on
those
occasions
observed
that
his
lady
always
rose
much
earlier
than
usual
but
unsuspecting
as
he
was
he
was
satisfied
with
the
reason
she
assigned
for
it
that
of
enjoying
the
pleasant
hours
of
the
morning
in
a
very
delicious
garden
a
pleasure
which
they
could
not
have
at
home
as
mr
faulkland
improvements
were
only
in
their
infancy
the
mutual
intercourse
between
the
two
families
was
thus
carried
on
for
more
than
three
months
when
the
time
drew
near
that
miss
bond
and
her
lover
were
to
be
united
and
every
thing
was
preparing
for
the
purpose
the
young
mr
bond
was
come
home
from
the
college
and
the
house
on
this
occasion
was
more
chearful
than
ever
mr
faulkland
and
his
lady
were
there
at
a
ball
one
night
when
the
latter
after
dancing
a
long
time
complained
suddenly
of
being
violently
ill
and
either
really
did
or
pretended
to
faint
she
was
immediately
conveyed
to
bed
and
at
her
request
another
room
prepared
for
mr
faulkland
he
extremely
alarmed
at
her
indisposition
came
to
her
purposing
to
sit
up
by
her
the
whole
night
the
youngest
of
the
miss
bond
offering
to
do
the
same
but
mrs
faulkland
absolutely
refused
them
both
and
about
midnight
saying
she
found
herself
inclined
to
sleep
insisted
on
their
retiring
nor
would
she
admit
a
servant
to
stay
in
the
room
but
contented
herself
with
having
a
candle
burning
on
the
hearth
mr
faulkland
who
really
had
an
affection
for
his
lady
was
impatient
the
next
morning
to
enquire
after
her
health
he
found
her
in
bed
the
complaints
of
the
preceding
night
all
renewed
the
family
were
extremely
disconcerted
at
this
unlucky
accident
and
expresed
the
utmost
uneasiness
all
but
the
eldest
miss
bond
who
was
silent
and
heard
her
mother
and
sisters
condoling
with
mr
faulkland
not
only
with
unconcern
but
a
suppressed
smile
of
contempt
which
did
not
escape
mr
faulkland
observation
he
now
began
to
resent
such
a
behaviour
which
he
thought
very
unkind
and
told
his
lady
he
wished
she
was
in
a
condition
to
be
removed
as
he
was
fearful
in
her
present
situation
it
might
be
very
inconvenient
to
the
family
to
have
her
remain
sick
in
their
house
especially
as
it
quite
broke
in
on
the
mirth
and
festivity
which
were
now
going
forward
to
this
she
replied
that
she
found
herself
so
weak
and
dispirited
which
she
said
was
always
the
consequence
of
those
faintings
to
which
she
had
been
subject
from
her
childhood
that
she
could
not
think
of
leaving
her
room
she
made
a
shift
however
to
rise
and
said
she
hoped
in
a
day
or
two
to
be
able
to
remove
mrs
bond
who
was
of
an
extremely
humane
and
tender
disposition
begged
of
her
not
to
think
of
stirring
till
she
found
her
health
perfectly
mrs
faulkland
thankfully
accepted
her
offer
and
mr
faulkland
though
reluctantly
was
obliged
to
acquiesce
they
remained
thus
two
days
longer
mrs
faulkland
complaints
still
furnishing
her
with
a
pretence
for
sleeping
alone
and
under
colour
of
not
giving
trouble
in
the
family
she
would
not
suffer
a
maid
to
sit
up
with
her
major
smyth
who
had
been
in
the
house
all
this
time
had
now
some
call
to
his
regiment
which
obliged
him
to
go
to
the
town
where
it
lay
and
mr
faulkland
heard
him
give
his
man
directions
for
their
journey
mrs
faulkland
still
kept
her
room
and
had
not
left
it
since
the
time
she
was
first
taken
ill
it
happened
that
the
chamber
which
was
assigned
for
mr
faulkland
immediately
joined
his
lady
and
was
only
separated
from
it
by
a
wainscot
partition
by
which
means
he
could
hear
the
least
stir
in
her
chamber
the
unsuspecting
injured
husband
whose
anxiety
for
his
faithless
wife
had
always
made
him
watchful
and
attentive
to
her
motions
happened
this
night
to
be
more
than
ordinarily
so
the
family
had
now
been
for
some
hours
buried
in
sleep
every
thing
was
profoundly
silent
for
some
time
mr
faulkland
who
hoped
his
lady
was
settled
to
rest
was
endeavouring
to
compose
himself
to
sleep
when
he
heard
her
stir
this
immediately
roused
him
and
raising
his
head
off
the
pillow
he
found
she
got
out
of
bed
though
she
seemed
to
use
the
utmost
precaution
he
nevertheless
heard
her
very
distinctly
open
her
door
and
go
out
surprized
as
he
was
at
this
motion
no
other
thought
occurred
to
him
than
that
perhaps
mrs
faulkland
finding
herself
ill
had
got
up
to
call
some
of
the
female
servants
prepossessed
with
this
belief
he
started
out
of
bed
and
hastily
slipping
on
his
clothes
ran
into
his
lady
room
where
he
found
her
candle
still
burning
as
he
concluded
she
would
presently
return
he
waited
some
minutes
in
her
chamber
at
length
perceiving
her
clothes
lying
on
a
chair
at
her
he
was
afraid
she
had
gone
out
without
putting
any
thing
on
her
and
though
the
night
was
not
cold
he
was
apprehensive
that
in
her
apparently
weak
condition
her
health
might
be
farther
injured
on
this
account
he
determined
to
go
in
quest
of
her
and
concluding
she
had
gone
to
the
apartment
of
the
female
servants
which
was
on
the
floor
over
that
on
which
they
lay
he
ascended
the
stairs
as
silently
as
possibly
as
he
was
passing
by
a
room
on
the
top
of
the
first
flight
he
heard
some
one
speak
in
a
low
voice
and
listning
fancied
it
was
his
wife
as
he
knew
not
who
lay
in
that
room
he
made
no
doubt
but
that
it
was
she
who
was
calling
the
person
that
slept
there
and
without
farther
reflection
hastily
opened
the
door
and
went
in
with
the
candle
which
he
had
taken
in
his
hand
on
his
sudden
entrance
the
person
who
was
in
bed
eagerly
called
out
who
is
there
he
soon
perceived
by
his
voice
that
it
was
major
smyth
he
was
about
to
make
an
apology
for
his
intrusion
when
he
perceiving
his
lady
wrapping
gown
which
he
had
seen
her
wear
that
morning
lying
on
the
floor
and
in
the
same
instant
recollecting
that
he
had
heard
a
woman
voice
when
he
was
the
door
the
horror
of
her
guilt
rushed
upon
him
at
once
and
without
making
any
answer
to
the
major
he
suddenly
drew
back
the
feet
curtains
of
the
bed
where
he
plainly
perceived
that
the
major
had
a
companion
though
she
had
hid
her
head
under
the
clothes
the
major
instantly
leaped
out
of
bed
and
though
he
saw
mr
faulkland
was
unarmed
he
snatched
up
one
of
his
own
pistols
which
lay
on
the
table
and
which
his
man
had
charged
that
night
as
they
were
to
go
a
short
journey
the
next
morning
mr
faulkland
in
the
first
transports
of
his
rage
seized
the
other
the
miserable
woman
observing
their
fatal
motions
threw
herself
out
of
bed
mr
faulkland
was
too
much
distracted
to
be
able
to
give
a
distinct
account
of
this
dreadful
incident
all
he
can
say
is
that
major
smyth
snapped
his
pistol
at
him
which
he
thinks
missed
fire
and
he
instantly
discharged
his
with
more
fatal
success
for
mrs
faulkland
who
had
in
the
instant
rushed
between
them
shrieked
out
and
dropped
on
the
ground
and
the
major
reeling
a
few
steps
fell
against
one
of
the
pillars
of
the
bed
and
cried
out
he
has
killed
us
both
mr
faulkland
says
that
after
this
dreadful
action
without
knowing
what
he
did
he
ran
down
stairs
and
opening
the
front
door
made
the
best
of
his
way
home
on
foot
the
phrenzy
of
his
mind
was
such
that
he
thought
not
of
providing
for
his
safety
but
having
got
into
his
house
he
had
no
intention
of
going
farther
when
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
one
of
his
servants
whom
he
had
left
behind
him
at
mr
bond
a
faithful
fellow
who
had
lived
with
him
many
years
came
to
him
scared
and
breathless
having
ran
himself
almost
dead
to
overtake
his
master
oh
sir
said
he
for
heaven
sake
get
away
as
fast
as
you
can
mr
bond
family
are
all
in
an
uproar
you
will
be
taken
if
you
do
not
make
your
escape
this
instant
have
i
killed
any
body
demanded
mr
faulkland
oh
sir
answered
the
man
you
have
killed
my
lady
and
major
smyth
is
mortally
wounded
i
know
not
what
i
did
cried
mr
faulkland
but
i
did
not
mean
to
hurt
your
mistress
i
believe
it
sir
replied
the
servant
but
i
fear
nobody
else
will
for
that
wicked
wretch
though
they
think
he
can
not
live
many
hours
would
take
away
your
life
if
he
could
the
report
of
the
pistol
alarmed
the
family
and
we
all
ran
into
his
room
gentry
and
servants
and
all
the
major
was
able
to
speak
but
my
lady
was
quite
dead
the
account
he
gives
is
that
my
lady
candle
having
gone
out
she
got
up
to
get
it
lighted
and
was
endeavouring
to
find
one
of
the
rooms
when
passing
by
his
and
seeing
a
light
for
he
was
but
just
got
into
bed
she
stepped
in
and
before
she
had
time
to
retire
again
you
rushed
in
like
a
madman
and
seeing
his
pistols
lie
on
the
table
you
snatched
them
both
up
and
discharged
one
at
your
lady
which
killed
her
on
the
spot
you
fired
the
other
at
him
while
he
was
leaping
out
of
bed
i
am
sure
sir
this
is
a
false
story
yet
as
the
family
may
all
believe
it
i
beg
you
on
my
knees
to
provide
for
your
safety
miss
bond
was
tearing
her
hair
for
her
lover
but
i
heard
her
say
she
was
glad
that
wicked
woman
meaning
my
lady
had
lost
her
life
they
had
sent
off
some
of
the
people
for
a
surgeon
and
i
ran
as
fast
as
i
could
to
warn
you
of
your
dangers
this
honest
fellow
not
contented
with
urging
his
master
soon
saddled
a
very
swift
hunter
which
he
had
in
the
stable
and
mr
faulkland
now
convinced
of
the
necessity
of
flying
mounted
it
directly
and
attended
only
by
one
groom
galloped
off
to
dublin
which
he
reached
by
seven
in
the
morning
and
was
lucky
enough
to
arrive
just
as
a
packet
which
was
going
off
with
an
express
was
ready
to
sail
he
went
on
board
and
landed
at
in
twelve
hours
from
thence
without
stopping
night
or
day
except
to
change
horses
he
rode
post
to
london
and
presented
himself
in
the
manner
i
have
already
told
you
before
me
such
my
cecilia
are
the
dismal
particulars
of
this
sad
story
my
brother
staid
with
me
it
was
very
late
our
time
was
past
in
consulting
on
measures
for
mr
faulkland
preservation
he
said
he
would
advise
him
by
all
means
to
get
over
to
holland
as
fast
as
he
could
for
if
that
story
which
the
execrable
smyth
had
invented
should
be
believed
and
it
was
very
likely
to
gain
credit
in
case
he
died
of
his
wound
and
persevered
in
it
to
the
last
mr
faulkland
having
no
witness
to
disprove
any
part
of
the
charge
would
be
in
imminent
danger
of
losing
his
life
i
need
not
describe
to
you
the
horror
in
which
i
passed
last
night
i
rose
this
morning
at
and
was
but
just
dressed
when
i
was
informed
mr
warner
wanted
to
speak
to
me
i
went
down
stairs
to
him
directly
i
could
not
sleep
all
night
for
thinking
of
your
affairs
said
he
without
any
previous
salute
and
i
am
so
impatient
to
hear
story
that
i
could
not
rest
i
came
to
you
to
be
informed
of
it
for
i
suppose
you
heard
every
thing
last
night
i
related
all
the
particulars
minutely
as
i
have
done
to
you
mr
warner
never
once
interrupting
me
when
i
had
ended
the
story
what
do
you
intend
for
faulkland
said
my
kinsman
i
know
not
what
to
do
sir
i
replied
but
this
i
am
sure
of
that
if
it
were
in
the
power
of
wealth
to
relieve
his
afflicted
mind
he
has
an
undoubted
right
to
a
large
portion
of
the
fortune
i
possess
this
i
think
myself
bound
to
bestow
on
the
man
who
when
i
was
destitute
offered
me
his
if
we
can
prevail
on
him
to
take
care
of
his
own
safety
which
when
he
is
a
little
more
collected
i
hope
we
shall
be
able
to
do
i
must
entreat
your
assistance
sir
in
helping
me
to
make
him
as
easy
as
his
unhappy
circumstances
will
admit
and
is
this
demanded
mr
warner
sternly
does
not
your
gratitude
suggest
a
warmer
recompence
than
giving
him
a
paultry
income
i
was
startled
at
the
question
and
not
replying
immediately
you
must
marry
him
said
he
in
a
peremptory
tone
there
is
nothing
now
to
hinder
you
the
heavy
misfortune
which
has
fallen
upon
him
puts
it
in
your
power
to
make
him
such
a
return
as
his
prosperous
days
would
not
have
allowed
you
you
can
confer
an
obligation
on
him
now
so
scruple
is
rubbed
out
as
for
any
former
idle
aspersions
you
have
already
done
more
than
enough
to
convince
the
world
they
were
without
foundation
i
could
wish
indeed
that
jezebel
of
a
wife
had
been
cut
off
in
the
common
way
but
since
he
was
guiltless
in
his
intentions
it
would
be
barbarous
to
make
an
objection
and
i
dare
answer
for
it
all
mankind
will
acquit
him
though
the
law
perhaps
may
not
of
that
scoundrel
death
who
so
well
deserved
it
at
his
hands
i
told
mr
warner
that
though
mr
faulkland
had
proposed
something
like
this
i
was
sure
it
was
owing
to
his
distracted
mind
for
that
he
had
at
first
declared
he
only
came
to
take
a
last
look
at
me
and
that
i
hoped
when
he
came
to
the
cool
use
of
his
reason
he
would
be
far
from
urging
such
a
request
the
more
are
you
bound
then
said
he
interrupting
me
to
deal
generously
by
what
does
your
brother
say
upon
the
subject
he
has
not
touched
upon
it
i
replied
i
was
so
taken
up
with
hearing
mr
faulkland
melancholy
story
from
my
brother
that
i
mentioned
not
to
him
his
wild
proposal
and
as
sir
george
told
me
mr
faulkland
was
much
more
composed
when
he
left
him
to
his
rest
i
presume
he
hinted
nothing
of
that
kind
to
my
brother
ay
ay
cried
mr
warner
sir
george
to
be
sure
will
change
his
note
mr
faulkland
is
now
a
fallen
man
therefore
depend
on
it
he
will
not
be
for
your
marrying
him
but
for
this
very
reason
i
insist
on
your
doing
a
noble
thing
if
you
have
a
grain
of
honour
or
of
gratitude
in
you
you
will
not
hesitate
a
moment
i
will
not
desire
you
continued
he
finding
me
silent
to
carry
your
gratitude
so
far
as
to
marry
a
madman
if
he
should
prove
to
be
so
but
if
on
your
visit
to
him
this
morning
you
find
him
composed
and
in
his
right
mind
make
him
a
frank
offer
of
your
hand
and
see
you
do
it
handsomely
consult
not
george
upon
the
subject
i
will
have
it
all
doing
go
added
he
if
i
did
not
know
that
at
the
bottom
of
your
heart
you
faulkland
i
would
not
make
this
a
point
with
you
but
notwithstanding
all
your
pretended
demurs
i
am
sure
that
is
the
case
i
should
be
disingenuous
to
deny
it
answered
i
far
from
doing
so
i
will
own
that
i
should
prefer
him
before
all
the
world
if
the
strangeness
of
his
present
situation
did
not
frighten
me
trouble
not
your
head
about
that
cried
mr
warner
if
the
man
is
in
his
senses
do
as
i
bid
you
and
take
care
that
you
acquit
yourself
with
honour
he
left
me
without
waiting
for
a
reply
what
can
i
say
or
do
my
cecilia
my
heart
and
my
reason
are
at
variance
what
a
strange
dilemma
am
i
driven
to
nobody
to
advise
me
mr
warner
precipitate
and
fanciful
in
his
determinations
urges
me
on
to
i
know
not
what
marry
mr
faulkland
receive
a
hand
stained
with
oh
the
very
thought
is
terrible
what
would
the
world
say
to
such
an
union
it
can
not
be
he
will
not
sure
when
he
comes
to
the
use
of
his
cooler
reason
insist
upon
a
promise
which
my
own
terror
and
his
desperation
extorted
from
me
i
must
try
to
convince
mr
warner
judgment
i
hope
he
will
not
obstinately
persist
in
pressing
me
to
what
i
dare
not
comply
with
my
brother
is
just
come
to
carry
me
to
mr
faulkland
heaven
grant
i
may
find
him
restored
to
his
right
mind
just
returned
from
my
visit
to
mr
faulkland
what
a
scene
he
wrung
my
very
heart
i
would
i
had
never
seen
him
we
found
him
up
and
walking
about
his
room
his
looks
much
more
composed
than
they
were
last
night
on
our
entering
his
chamber
his
eyes
sparkled
with
pleasure
he
ran
to
my
brother
and
embraced
him
thank
you
my
dear
dear
bidulph
said
he
you
at
length
give
her
to
me
and
with
her
own
consent
too
my
bride
turning
passionately
to
me
and
snatching
my
hand
my
brother
seemed
shocked
and
cast
his
eyes
mournfully
at
me
mine
moistened
and
i
was
obliged
to
apply
my
handkerchief
to
them
turning
my
head
away
tears
cried
mr
faulkland
in
a
tone
of
surprize
and
on
our
i
could
not
bear
this
i
sobbed
aloud
my
brother
was
willing
if
possible
to
give
his
thoughts
another
turn
for
not
knowing
what
had
passed
the
day
before
he
thought
this
was
some
sudden
start
of
phrenzy
my
dear
faulkland
said
he
you
affect
my
sister
too
much
we
have
been
consulting
for
your
safety
and
came
to
talk
with
you
upon
it
i
think
there
is
no
time
to
be
lost
and
that
you
ought
immediately
to
retire
into
holland
i
am
ready
said
mr
faulkland
but
mrs
arnold
goes
with
me
i
have
her
promise
for
it
sidney
shall
follow
you
answered
my
brother
making
a
motion
to
me
to
shew
he
would
have
me
humour
him
in
his
ravings
i
will
not
go
without
her
cried
mr
faulkland
the
universe
shall
not
now
part
us
i
was
almost
distracted
with
apprehension
and
knew
not
what
reply
to
make
my
brother
looked
confounded
and
was
silent
mr
faulkland
approached
me
and
with
a
look
of
gloomy
despair
you
are
both
mute
said
he
bidulph
i
always
thought
loved
me
mrs
arnold
i
hoped
did
not
wish
my
death
but
i
am
deceived
in
you
both
i
have
no
farther
business
with
life
the
friend
i
most
confided
in
betrays
me
the
woman
whom
my
soul
worships
and
to
whom
i
sacrificed
all
my
hopes
of
happiness
repays
me
with
ingratitude
why
should
such
a
wretch
any
longer
submit
to
life
i
have
borne
it
too
long
already
but
there
my
remedy
pointing
furiously
to
his
sword
which
lay
in
the
scabbard
on
a
table
i
could
no
longer
contain
myself
but
bursting
into
tears
oh
sir
said
i
accuse
me
not
of
ingratitude
i
would
to
heaven
death
could
repair
the
heavy
afflictions
i
have
brought
upon
you
if
it
could
i
would
welcome
it
this
hour
your
reproaches
cruel
as
they
are
i
forgive
i
own
myself
the
unhappy
cause
of
all
your
misfortunes
we
have
been
mutually
fatal
to
each
other
you
know
i
always
valued
and
esteemed
you
and
have
in
your
calamity
already
been
sufficiently
punished
for
the
share
i
have
had
in
bringing
it
on
you
what
shall
i
say
to
you
sir
my
whole
fortune
i
think
too
small
too
poor
a
recompence
to
the
man
who
has
obliged
me
beyond
a
possibility
of
return
yet
what
have
i
to
offer
more
can
you
sir
can
you
urge
me
to
a
marriage
at
so
strange
a
juncture
think
how
it
will
expose
us
both
to
censure
your
long
attachment
to
me
has
not
been
a
secret
think
what
dreadful
constructions
may
be
put
on
conduct
nay
on
should
a
union
now
take
place
brought
about
as
it
must
appear
by
so
terrible
an
event
mr
faulkland
was
silent
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
my
brother
took
up
the
argument
indeed
my
dear
faulkland
my
sister
has
reason
for
her
fears
you
know
i
ever
was
your
sincere
friend
you
know
too
i
always
was
of
opinion
that
sidney
ought
to
have
been
your
wife
her
former
objections
i
thought
were
romantic
scruples
and
hardly
forgave
her
refusing
you
the
present
obstacle
has
more
weight
in
it
do
not
mistake
me
added
he
hastily
seeing
mr
faulkland
raise
his
eyes
full
of
resentment
at
him
i
wish
my
sister
still
to
be
yours
and
will
consent
to
your
marriage
with
my
whole
heart
but
let
me
conjure
you
to
take
a
more
favourable
juncture
withdraw
yourself
but
for
the
present
your
affairs
may
not
be
so
desperate
as
you
imagine
if
that
villain
smyth
should
chance
to
recover
perhaps
his
conscience
may
awaken
remorse
and
he
may
be
prevailed
on
to
do
you
justice
in
that
case
you
must
be
cleared
from
the
most
distant
imputation
of
what
my
sister
hinted
at
and
what
has
but
too
justly
alarmed
her
cleared
as
your
character
will
then
be
and
conscious
as
we
both
are
of
the
innocence
of
your
intentions
there
will
remain
no
bar
to
mrs
arnold
giving
you
her
hand
smyth
recover
interrupted
mr
faulkland
suddenly
there
is
no
hope
can
spring
from
that
then
answered
my
brother
at
worst
you
can
but
live
abroad
all
parts
of
the
world
are
alike
to
such
a
philosopher
as
my
sister
is
and
probably
circumstanced
as
your
marriage
will
appear
she
may
like
best
to
reside
out
of
mr
faulkland
shook
his
head
and
with
a
smile
of
indignation
leave
me
bidulph
cried
he
i
can
not
bear
attempting
to
deceive
me
you
think
me
mad
and
are
cruel
enough
to
endeavour
at
imposing
on
me
i
know
my
mind
is
disturbed
but
who
has
driven
me
to
despair
to
madness
to
death
and
he
cast
a
look
at
me
that
chilled
my
blood
be
satisfied
madam
you
shall
soon
be
rid
of
this
fatal
hated
betrayed
abandoned
wretch
he
spoke
this
with
his
hands
grasped
eagerly
together
and
his
eyes
lifted
up
to
heaven
then
striking
his
breast
he
burst
into
tears
and
rushing
suddenly
into
his
closet
he
shut
the
door
violently
locking
it
on
the
inside
he
wept
aloud
and
his
agonies
reduced
me
almost
to
the
same
condition
with
himself
i
begged
my
brother
would
endeavour
to
prevail
on
him
to
open
the
door
for
i
was
fearful
of
his
making
some
dreadful
attempt
upon
his
own
life
but
sir
george
a
little
quieted
my
fears
by
shewing
me
his
sword
which
still
lay
on
the
table
and
which
at
my
desire
he
put
out
of
the
way
my
brother
approached
the
closet
door
and
in
the
most
soothing
language
beseeched
him
to
open
it
but
he
could
get
no
other
answer
from
mr
faulkland
than
to
beg
he
would
leave
him
to
himself
i
found
this
was
not
a
time
for
arguing
i
told
my
brother
we
had
better
suffer
him
to
vent
his
passion
alone
and
that
perhaps
when
he
had
time
to
reflect
a
little
on
what
had
been
said
he
would
permit
his
cooler
reason
to
govern
him
sir
george
was
very
unwilling
to
leave
him
in
such
a
distracted
state
of
mind
he
renewed
his
efforts
to
persuade
him
to
come
out
of
the
closet
but
to
no
purpose
i
beseech
you
to
leave
me
sir
george
said
he
i
am
not
in
a
condition
to
talk
i
can
not
bear
the
sight
of
mrs
arnold
let
me
recover
myself
another
time
perhaps
i
may
be
better
able
to
discourse
with
you
will
you
promise
me
then
replied
my
brother
that
you
will
in
the
interim
do
nothing
that
may
be
injurious
to
your
life
or
health
indeed
my
dear
faulkland
you
distress
my
sister
and
me
more
than
you
can
imagine
name
the
hour
when
you
will
permit
me
to
come
to
you
again
and
for
heaven
sake
think
of
your
own
immediate
preservation
once
secured
there
is
nothing
which
my
sister
and
i
will
not
afterwards
do
to
make
you
happy
can
i
rely
on
you
faulkland
do
you
promise
me
not
to
be
rash
you
have
my
sword
in
your
possession
answered
mr
faulkland
still
speaking
within
the
closet
i
have
no
other
weapon
about
me
leave
me
sir
george
i
can
not
talk
say
but
that
you
wish
to
see
me
again
replied
my
brother
and
i
will
go
and
give
you
no
further
trouble
mr
faulkland
sighed
deeply
say
i
wish
to
see
you
he
repeated
ah
bidulph
and
his
voice
seemed
choaked
my
brother
could
not
refrain
from
tears
i
will
come
to
you
in
the
evening
faulkland
you
will
find
me
your
true
i
should
be
loath
to
lay
you
under
any
restraint
here
in
the
house
of
my
friend
do
but
say
there
is
no
need
of
it
promise
me
the
slightest
word
will
suffice
i
know
my
dear
faulkland
will
not
break
his
word
well
i
will
not
attempt
my
life
cried
he
impatiently
let
that
satisfy
you
leave
me
and
let
me
not
be
exposed
to
any
insults
here
i
leave
you
answered
my
brother
and
hope
to
find
you
more
composed
a
few
hours
hence
mrs
arnold
too
begs
you
will
be
calm
and
think
of
preserving
a
life
which
is
so
dear
to
us
both
mr
faulkland
was
silent
and
my
brother
and
i
withdrew
he
thought
it
best
i
should
not
speak
to
him
sir
george
left
me
at
home
and
said
he
would
call
again
on
mr
faulkland
in
the
afternoon
and
bring
me
word
how
he
should
find
him
my
brother
is
exceedingly
affected
with
his
situation
and
says
he
knows
not
what
to
advise
he
is
fearful
that
mr
faulkland
phrenzy
is
not
to
be
calmed
but
by
consenting
to
marry
him
and
circumstanced
as
he
now
is
that
thought
is
terrible
yet
if
i
persist
in
my
refusal
i
drive
the
noblest
of
minds
to
desperation
oh
my
cecilia
is
this
the
return
i
ought
to
make
to
the
most
generous
of
men
whose
fervent
love
for
me
has
been
a
constant
source
of
torment
to
him
for
so
many
years
yet
how
can
i
yield
him
my
hand
all
my
former
scruples
weighty
as
they
appeared
to
me
were
light
to
the
dreadful
bar
that
now
interposes
had
that
woman
died
the
common
way
with
what
joy
what
exultation
could
i
have
rewarded
his
honest
persevering
love
all
my
duties
fulfilled
obedience
to
my
mother
justice
to
the
woman
i
thought
injured
reverence
to
the
memory
of
my
husband
the
respect
due
to
my
own
character
should
i
not
my
cecilia
after
thus
being
acquitted
of
all
other
obligations
have
been
to
blame
if
after
a
series
of
misfortunes
all
brought
on
by
my
strict
adherence
to
those
duties
should
i
not
have
been
to
blame
for
refusing
at
length
to
do
justice
to
the
most
deserving
of
men
when
i
reflect
on
the
past
when
i
survey
the
present
and
my
foreboding
heart
whispers
to
me
the
future
sufferings
of
our
dear
unhappy
mr
faulkland
all
my
philosophy
forsakes
me
i
have
borne
up
under
my
own
sorrows
his
quite
subdue
me
i
must
lay
by
my
pen
my
eyes
are
brimful
of
tears
ah
my
dear
what
will
become
of
us
i
am
almost
dead
with
apprehension
rash
rash
unhappy
mr
faulkland
he
has
fled
from
the
house
where
my
brother
had
concealed
him
i
know
not
what
i
am
writing
my
fears
distract
me
is
but
two
hours
since
we
left
him
sir
george
relying
on
his
promise
and
unwilling
to
provoke
him
by
any
appearance
of
constraint
gave
no
caution
to
the
gentleman
with
whom
he
was
lodged
to
observe
his
motions
he
is
ready
to
kill
himself
for
this
neglect
but
relying
on
mr
faulkland
promise
not
to
make
any
attempt
on
his
life
he
suspected
not
that
he
would
endeavour
to
escape
escape
do
i
call
it
rather
let
me
say
to
throw
himself
into
certain
he
is
set
out
on
his
way
for
ireland
heaven
knows
what
will
be
the
consequence
of
this
if
my
brother
does
not
overtake
and
persuade
him
back
he
is
gone
after
him
my
cousin
warner
with
him
both
rode
post
my
thoughts
are
so
confused
i
can
put
nothing
in
order
it
seems
we
had
not
long
quitted
him
when
he
called
up
his
servant
that
groom
who
as
i
informed
you
had
come
over
with
him
and
telling
him
he
was
going
out
of
town
ordered
him
to
go
directly
to
an
inn
somewhere
in
the
city
and
hire
two
and
that
he
would
follow
him
presently
the
man
obeyed
and
in
about
half
an
hour
his
master
came
in
a
to
the
place
where
he
had
directed
him
to
wait
for
him
upon
the
enquiring
whither
the
horses
were
to
go
mr
faulkland
replied
to
st
alban
the
man
objected
to
the
length
of
the
stage
and
named
barnet
mr
faulkland
seemed
impatient
and
angry
his
unusual
earnestness
his
wild
looks
and
the
road
he
purposed
taking
alarmed
his
servant
a
discreet
elderly
man
and
he
had
the
prudence
immediately
to
dispatch
the
master
of
the
house
whom
he
prevailed
on
by
a
piece
of
money
to
go
directly
to
my
brother
with
this
intelligence
he
had
the
precaution
not
to
mention
his
master
name
only
bade
him
find
out
sir
george
bidulph
and
tell
him
that
his
friend
was
set
out
for
st
alban
and
that
his
man
had
dispatched
him
with
the
news
and
would
if
possible
endeavour
to
detain
him
on
the
road
that
sir
george
might
overtake
him
the
man
was
punctual
in
delivering
his
message
my
brother
wild
with
amazement
and
horror
just
called
as
he
past
my
door
to
tell
me
this
new
and
unexpected
misfortune
mr
warner
had
that
instant
come
to
enquire
what
had
past
between
mr
faulkland
and
me
in
our
interview
this
morning
i
had
no
time
to
tell
him
any
thing
he
looked
very
much
displeased
at
my
brother
and
me
upon
hearing
mr
faulkland
was
gone
but
said
he
would
accompany
sir
george
and
they
both
hurried
away
together
the
man
said
mr
faulkland
had
set
off
before
he
could
leave
his
house
the
servant
having
scarce
time
to
give
him
the
message
i
fear
it
will
be
impossible
for
my
brother
to
overtake
him
he
will
be
lost
forever
what
then
will
be
my
portion
happy
had
it
been
for
me
indeed
as
my
dear
mother
once
said
in
the
bitterness
of
her
heart
that
i
had
died
in
my
cradle
twelve
heaven
be
praised
they
are
returned
returned
mr
faulkland
has
been
prevailed
on
to
come
back
mr
warner
has
prevailed
on
him
he
has
saved
his
life
but
my
cecilia
thy
friend
temporal
happiness
and
peace
of
mind
is
the
only
price
that
could
ransom
this
desperate
victim
mr
warner
has
bound
himself
by
a
solemn
oath
that
i
should
become
his
wife
or
mr
faulkland
determined
on
his
own
destruction
would
spite
of
all
they
could
do
have
pursued
his
fatal
journey
to
ireland
in
order
to
deliver
himself
up
to
justice
it
was
near
ten
before
they
returned
to
town
my
brother
carried
mr
faulkland
back
to
the
gentleman
house
where
he
was
before
lodged
and
my
kinsman
left
them
together
in
order
to
come
and
give
me
an
account
of
what
passed
he
said
the
gentleman
at
whose
house
he
was
lodged
by
my
brother
was
extreamly
surprized
at
seeing
him
again
mr
faulkland
having
with
great
composure
taken
his
leave
of
him
in
the
morning
and
after
thanking
him
for
the
shelter
he
had
afforded
him
told
him
he
was
going
out
of
town
my
brother
and
my
kinsman
overtook
him
above
a
mile
on
this
side
st
alban
for
which
success
they
were
intirely
indebted
to
the
prudence
of
the
servant
who
attended
him
for
the
poor
man
finding
himself
pushing
on
with
the
utmost
eagerness
and
mr
faulkland
no
longer
making
a
secret
of
this
intention
of
returning
to
ireland
resolved
at
all
events
to
prevent
his
ruin
and
hoping
that
by
a
little
delay
sir
george
might
overtake
them
contrived
at
their
first
stage
so
dexterously
to
slip
a
nail
in
between
the
horse
shoe
and
his
hoof
that
he
knew
he
could
not
go
far
without
being
lame
this
succeeded
so
well
that
the
poor
animal
was
soon
disabled
and
mr
faulkland
not
having
it
in
his
power
to
mount
himself
better
was
obliged
to
go
on
at
a
very
easy
rate
they
arrived
at
the
next
stage
mr
warner
and
my
brother
overtook
him
in
this
situation
sir
george
knew
him
as
soon
as
they
came
in
sight
of
him
and
followed
him
at
a
proper
distance
still
keeping
him
in
view
he
lighted
at
the
they
then
at
once
entered
the
room
into
which
he
had
retired
whilst
fresh
horses
were
getting
ready
mr
faulkland
started
at
the
sight
of
my
brother
he
looked
earnestly
at
mr
warner
whom
he
had
never
seen
before
but
spoke
not
to
either
of
them
sir
george
pursued
my
kinsman
accosted
him
affectionately
dear
faulkland
was
this
kind
of
you
thus
to
fly
from
your
friends
that
love
you
he
presented
me
to
him
at
the
same
naming
me
as
his
relation
mr
faulkland
grasped
the
hand
which
i
reached
out
in
salutation
to
him
he
fixed
his
fine
sparkling
eyes
on
my
face
is
it
mr
warner
whom
i
have
the
honour
to
salute
sir
i
am
no
stranger

your
worth

unhappy
wretch

and
forsaken

all
the
world

i
forsake
you
faulkland
cried
your
brother
kindly
enough
no
faulkland

your
constant
sincere
friend
and
will
prove
myself
so
if
you
will
but
let
me
mr
faulkland

no
reply

faulkland

your
true
friend

me
to
be
so
come
back
with
me
mr
warner
and
i
have
followed
you
in
the
hope
of
prevailing
on
you
to
return
with
us
do
faulkland

us
persuade
you
to
preserve
a
life
so
dear
to
us
all
what

i
to
live
for
answered
mr
faulkland
sternly
have
tried
to
deceive
me
the
man
i
loved
most
now
i
am
fallen
rejects
me
your
sister
persists
in
her
obstinate
cruelty
towards
me
she
breaks
her
promise
and
you
encourage
her
in
it
i
have
neither
friends
fortune
or
country
and
do
you
talk
to
me
of
life
on
conditions
no
bidulph
it
is
a
burden
of
which
i
will
rid
myself
mr
warner
are
a
generous
man
have
an
enlarged
mind
may
a
stranger
ask
a
favour
of
you
i
could
have
wept
continued
my
kinsman
to
see
such
a
frank
noble
fellow
driven
to
such
desperation
command
me
sir
i
replied
there
is
nothing
i
would
not
do
to
serve
you
i
thank
you
sir
i
have
a
little
son
let
me
recommend
the
unhappy
orphan
to
your
protection
he
will
soon
want
a
father
will
you
be
one
to
him
sir
i
will
send
him
over
to
you
he
laid
hold
of
my
hand
and
repeated
his
question
will
you
mr
warner
have
an
enlarged
mind
and
do
not
despise
the
unfortunate
i
cried
downright
he
touched
me
to
the
very
quick
i
never
was
so
affected
in
my
life
and
i
own
i
was
heartily
displeased
both
with
you
and
your
brother
for
driving
him
to
such
extremities
especially
on
whom
i
laid
injunctions
to
act
in
a
contrary
way
as
for
sir
george
i
am
not
surprized
at
behaviour
from
mr
faulkland
discourse
proceeded
my
kinsman
it
was
apparent
to
me
that
his
distraction
proceeded
from
no
other
cause
than
his
belief
that
you
and
your
brother
slighted
him
in
his
misfortunes
it
was
plain
when
he
fled
to
england
that
he
was
sufficiently
in
his
senses
to
be
anxious
for
his
own
safety
and
though
the
sight
of
you
joined
to
the
hurry
of
his
spirits
his
fatigue
and
want
of
sleep
might
in
a
man
of
such
violent
passions
have
created
a
temporary
phrenzy
yet
i
am
very
certain
it
would
all
have
subsided
if
you
had
behaved
to
him
as
you
ought
to
have
done
and
as
i
desired
you
would
nor
do
i
see
how
you
can
answer
it
to
yourself
after
the
miseries
you
have
already
brought
on
such
a
glorious
man
for
i
never
saw
his
equal
either
in
mind
or
person
to
persist
in
a
behaviour
which
has
already
turned
his
brain
and
must
in
the
end
occasion
his
death
for
death
he
is
determined
on
if
you
refuse
to
become
his
wife
oh
sir
cried
i
leave
him
not
to
himself
i
conjure
you
you
see
the
influence
you
have
over
his
mind
you
have
done
wonders
in
bringing
him
hold
replied
mr
warner
till
i
inform
you
of
the
means
i
was
obliged
to
use
i
have
told
you
how
i
was
affected
with
his
situation
and
the
request
he
made
me
to
take
care
of
his
child
this
was
not
the
suggestion
of
madness
it
was
plain
to
me
that
if
the
cause
were
removed
he
would
soon
be
restored
to
the
perfect
use
of
his
reason
and
i
could
not
bear
to
see
the
desolation
of
such
a
noble
frame
and
all
charged
to
your
account
sir
i
hope
you
do
not
mean
said
i
to
return
to
ireland
do
you
not
know
the
risque
that
you
run
by
putting
yourself
into
the
power
of
an
exasperated
family
from
whom
you
can
expect
nothing
but
the
most
malevolent
persecution
i
deliver
myself
up
to
the
laws
replied
mr
faulkland
my
life
is
devoted
is
indifferent
to
me
how
i
die
suppose
said
i
mrs
arnold
should
consent
to
marry
you
would
not
that
reconcile
you
to
life
oh
sir
and
he
shook
his
head
i
am
not
to
be
deceived
your
brother
walked
about
the
room
without
taking
part
in
the
conversation
i
do
not
mean
it
sir
mrs
arnold
must
be
yours
can
influence
her
do
but
return
back
with
me
i
give
you
my
honour
i
will
do
my
utmost
to
prevail
on
her
to
give
you
her
hand
immediately
her
heart
is
hardened
sir
she
will
not
consent
replied
he
i
have
no
friend
to
urge
her
i
am
an
outcast
and
not
fit
to
live
will
urge
her
sir
she
respects
me
she
will
be
guided
by
me
she
shall
fulfil
the
promise
she
made
you
oh
sir
you
but
deceive
yourself
she
will
find
out
new
excuses
i
am
not
to
be
again
allured
by
false
hopes
he
stepped
towards
the
door
as
he
spoke
these
words
and
was
about
to
open
it
your
brother
followed
and
laid
hold
of
his
arm
i
did
the
same
sir
george
said
he
expose
me
not
to
insults
why
do
you
persecute
me
leave
me
sir
i
am
a
madman
but
i
am
and
he
spoke
as
if
he
were
so
for
heaven
sake
faulkland
said
your
brother
be
composed
you
have
mr
warner
word
of
honour
you
shall
have
mine
too
that
we
will
do
our
utmost
to
persuade
mrs
arnold
to
consent
to
your
wishes
you
have
full
consent
you
have
won
mr
warner
to
your
interest
my
sister
will
yield
to
our
joint
entreaties
he
repeated
no
no
sir
george
she
has
a
stubborn
heart
i
once
thought
it
otherwise
but
it
is
turned
to
stone
nothing
but
my
death
will
satisfy
her
and
she
be
satisfied
he
made
an
effort
to
break
from
us
stay
mr
faulkland
said
i
again
laying
hold
of
his
hand
and
i
here
swear
to
you
by
every
thing
that
is
sacred
that
if
you
will
suffer
me
to
conduct
you
back
into
mrs
presence
i
will
insist
on
her
immediately
accepting
of
you
for
her
husband
or
i
will
for
ever
renounce
all
friendship
with
her
i
know
she
esteems
and
values
you
above
all
men
i
am
therefore
sure
i
do
no
violence
to
her
inclinations
and
if
she
perseveres
in
her
obstinate
punctilios
i
swear
to
you
by
the
same
oath
that
i
will
no
longer
oppose
you
in
your
resolutions
let
them
be
what
they
will
sir
george
added
i
do
you
join
with
me
in
giving
your
friend
the
same
assurances
i
do
answered
he
solemnly
addressing
himself
to
mr
faulkland
and
swear
by
all
my
hopes
of
happiness
hereafter
to
act
in
conjunction
with
mr
warner
in
every
particular
that
he
has
promised
mr
faulkland
seemed
to
be
moved
he
looked
whistfully
at
us
by
turns
as
if
willing
though
afraid
to
yield
to
our
entreaties
at
length
i
i
may
rely
on
you
said
he
you
will
not
break
an
oath
to
sir
george
but
that
woman
has
such
an
heart
you
can
not
change
we
will
do
our
utmost
we
both
answered
together
remember
then
said
he
stretching
out
a
hand
to
each
of
us
you
have
sworn
if
she
persists
in
her
resolution
that
you
will
leave
me
to
myself
and
oppose
me
no
longer
we
have
i
will
go
back
with
you
then
cried
mr
faulkland
and
stepped
again
nimbly
to
the
door
it
will
be
best
said
i
if
we
can
hire
a
coach
to
carry
us
there
is
no
necessity
for
our
riding
post
and
we
shall
be
less
liable
to
observation
than
if
we
were
on
mr
faulkland
looked
as
if
he
suspected
some
design
do
you
not
mean
said
he
to
go
directly
back
to
london
certainly
i
replied
and
shall
i
see
mrs
arnold
without
doubt
if
you
desire
it
let
us
go
then
said
he
i
think
a
coach
is
a
tedious
way
of
travelling
but
i
submit
to
guidance
i
left
sir
george
with
him
and
went
out
to
enquire
whether
we
could
be
provided
with
a
coach
and
four
which
after
some
delay
was
procured
for
us
we
prevailed
on
mr
faulkland
whilst
it
was
getting
ready
to
take
a
little
refreshment
he
asked
us
by
what
means
we
were
informed
of
his
departure
sir
george
unwilling
to
let
him
know
that
his
servant
had
discovered
it
evaded
the
question
and
only
replied
do
you
think
faulkland
that
in
the
humour
i
left
you
i
could
be
inattentive
to
your
motions
i
am
not
a
madman
bidulph
i
must
not
be
treated
like
one
i
do
not
think
you
one
answered
your
brother
but
i
know
you
are
warm
and
too
fearless
of
danger
when
the
coach
was
ready
mr
faulkland
very
willingly
got
into
it
with
us
he
spoke
but
little
and
appeared
very
thoughtful
during
our
journey
the
coachman
stopped
at
an
inn
after
we
had
driven
about
fifteen
miles
to
bate
his
horses
for
a
while
he
seemed
startled
at
it
and
said
he
would
not
alight
we
told
him
there
was
no
occasion
but
your
brother
and
i
chose
to
go
into
the
house
that
he
might
not
think
we
watched
him
he
seemed
pleased
at
this
and
smiled
when
we
set
forward
again
but
did
not
speak
when
we
arrived
in
london
now
sir
said
i
we
will
if
you
please
go
directly
to
mrs
arnold
house
as
i
am
sure
your
absenting
yourself
in
the
manner
you
did
exceedingly
afflicted
her
so
am
i
certain
your
return
will
give
her
sincere
joy
i
am
ready
therefore
to
attend
you
immediately
to
her
but
if
i
may
advise
you
i
think
it
were
better
that
i
should
first
see
and
talk
to
her
it
will
be
proper
to
prepare
her
by
giving
her
at
least
one
night
to
reflect
on
the
important
event
which
i
expect
will
take
place
sir
george
what
are
your
sentiments
i
am
of
your
mind
replied
your
brother
i
think
my
sister
ought
by
all
means
to
have
so
much
time
given
her
for
recollection
if
faulkland
has
no
objection
to
it
we
will
go
to
my
friend
house
where
he
was
before
when
you
have
seen
my
sister
you
may
come
to
us
there
with
her
determination
i
have
submitted
myself
for
the
present
answered
mr
faulkland
to
your
guidance
remember
i
am
to
be
at
liberty
bidulph
beware
how
you
watch
my
motions
again
your
brother
then
directed
the
coachman
to
his
friend
house
mr
faulkland
not
opposing
the
motion
i
went
in
for
a
few
minutes
merely
to
satisfy
myself
in
what
manner
mr
faulkland
had
escaped
from
thence
in
order
to
inform
you
mr
faulkland
was
very
urgent
with
me
to
go
to
you
keep
me
not
long
in
suspence
sir
said
he
i
may
as
well
know
my
fate
as
i
left
him
with
a
promise
to
return
with
your
final
answer
you
know
sentiments
you
know
your
brother
and
it
rests
on
you
to
pronounce
sentence
of
life
or
death
for
your
answer
imports
no
less
on
a
man
who
is
worthy
of
the
greatest
queen
in
the
universe
what
do
you
say
mrs
arnold
must
faulkland
die
heaven
forbid
cried
i
no
sir
i
should
be
inflexible
if
after
what
you
have
told
me
i
were
any
longer
to
resist
i
yield
sir
to
your
request
to
mr
faulkland
and
to
my
brother
and
i
will
own
at
the
same
time
that
my
heart
strongly
impels
me
to
consent
yet
my
dear
sir
believe
me
i
should
have
resisted
impulse
if
i
could
hope
that
my
refusal
would
not
be
followed
by
consequences
too
dreadful
to
be
thought
on
there
is
therefore
alternative
i
be
the
wife
of
mr
faulkland
the
sooner
the
affair
is
finished
then
the
better
said
he
faulkland
stands
here
on
slippery
ground
perhaps
some
of
the
bond
family
may
by
this
time
be
arrived
in
england
and
in
pursuit
of
him
therefore
let
your
marriage
be
dispatched
immediately
and
send
him
away
directly
to
holland
i
suppose
when
he
has
made
sure
of
you
he
may
be
prevailed
on
to
go
without
you
oh
sir
said
i
urge
this
request
to
him
i
beseech
you
it
is
of
the
last
importance
to
me
that
he
should
comply
with
it
and
the
only
preliminary
that
i
have
now
to
make
to
our
marriage
yes
yes
answered
my
kinsman
i
think
we
shall
convince
him
of
the
necessity
of
this
i
shall
escort
you
to
holland
myself
for
i
have
business
at
rotterdam
and
i
had
thoughts
of
taking
the
voyage
if
this
occasion
had
not
offered
we
will
but
just
stay
to
settle
some
affairs
here
and
observe
what
measures
can
be
taken
for
his
service
and
then
follow
him
take
courage
my
dear
continued
he
seeing
me
look
sad
all
may
come
right
again
i
love
adventures
and
this
i
think
one
we
will
live
like
princes
let
us
go
where
we
will
i
only
wish
that
your
brother
were
the
match
that
i
might
have
the
more
pleasure
in
forwarding
it
but
i
need
not
grudge
him
that
in
his
life
he
has
shewn
some
tokens
of
generosity
i
will
return
to
faulkland
i
long
to
set
his
noble
heart
at
ease
strange
perverse
creatures
your
sex
are
it
amazes
me
that
any
thing
could
tempt
you
to
reject
such
a
man
were
i
a
woman
i
should
run
mad
for
him
well
i
will
go
to
him
and
let
him
know
without
any
farther
demurs
you
will
give
him
your
hand
morning
our
honest
friend
price
i
think
may
join
you
i
will
call
on
him
after
i
have
seen
faulkland
to
bid
him
prepare
for
the
business
i
will
myself
have
the
pleasure
of
giving
you
away
good
by
and
away
he
went
with
a
pleased
busy
countenance
i
took
up
my
pen
as
soon
as
he
departed
and
have
scribbled
thus
far
without
suffering
any
reflections
to
stop
me
let
me
now
lay
down
my
pen
to
pause
before
i
leap
into
the
frightful
precipice
that
opens
before
me
ah
my
cecilia
what
is
that
morrow
to
produce
it
joins
me
for
ever
to
mr
faulkland
the
chosen
of
my
heart
my
first
love
the
man
who
adores
me
who
deserves
all
my
affection
who
has
obliged
me
beyond
all
recompence
who
has
a
claim
to
my
warmest
gratitude
to
my
esteem
to
my
whole
heart
i
save
his
life
i
have
the
power
to
make
him
happy
my
brother
my
kinsman
urge
me
my
own
heart
too
prompts
me
why
can
not
i
then
reconcile
myself
to
my
lot
oh
that
question
is
answered
by
a
fearful
image
that
starts
up
to
my
fancy
i
am
not
superstitious
yet
believe
me
my
dear
i
am
at
this
instant
chilled
with
horror
i
am
ashamed
to
confess
my
weakness
but
i
must
call
patty
to
sit
with
me
the
remainder
of
the
night
i
can
not
think
of
rest
i
have
passed
the
whole
night
in
endeavouring
to
fortify
my
mind
against
the
important
event
that
a
few
hours
will
accomplish
if
mr
mind
should
again
become
tranquil
which
my
kinsman
gave
me
room
to
hope
would
be
the
consequence
of
gratifying
the
ardent
wish
of
his
soul
i
must
take
care
not
to
disturb
it
by
shewing
any
reluctance
in
yielding
him
my
hand
had
an
angel
told
me
that
i
should
give
my
hand
to
mr
faulkland
i
would
not
have
believed
it
yet
fatally
circumstanced
as
our
marriage
is
it
can
not
be
otherwise
and
yet
i
to
be
his
i
owe
him
a
great
sacrifice
and
i
am
about
to
pay
it
i
am
dressed
and
ready
i
wait
for
my
kinsman
or
my
brother
one
of
whom
or
both
perhaps
will
be
here
presently
mr
warner
is
come
i
have
but
just
time
to
tell
you
that
my
brother
and
mr
price
are
with
mr
faulkland
my
kinsman
says
he
is
quite
a
new
man
they
wait
for
me
i
go
heaven
guide
my
steps
my
fate
is
accomplished
what
a
change
join
with
me
my
dear
cecilia
in
beseeching
heaven
to
look
graciously
down
on
me
in
my
new
state
and
to
guide
and
protect
my
beloved
mr
faulkland
my
ever
destined
husband
alas
my
dear
he
is
now
many
miles
separated
from
me
the
worthy
mr
price
performed
the
sacred
ceremony
mr
warner
did
the
office
of
a
father
he
and
my
brother
were
all
who
were
present
there
is
something
so
amazing
in
all
this
i
can
scarce
credit
my
senses
but
my
life
has
been
a
series
of
strange
strange
events
i
am
so
bewildered
i
can
not
connect
my
thoughts
but
i
will
try
to
give
you
my
yesterday
for
i
can
hardly
persuade
myself
that
what
i
recollect
really
happened
i
broke
off
just
as
mr
warner
called
on
me
to
carry
me
to
the
house
of
my
brother
friend
while
we
were
in
the
coach
he
told
me
that
having
the
night
before
informed
mr
faulkland
of
the
joyful
news
of
my
consenting
to
marry
him
the
next
day
he
seemed
at
first
to
doubt
and
repeatedly
conjured
him
not
to
deceive
him
having
received
the
most
solemn
assurances
of
its
being
true
mr
faulkland
gave
himself
up
to
such
ecstacies
as
made
them
apprehensive
his
joy
might
have
effects
almost
as
fatal
in
their
consequences
as
his
despair
was
likely
to
produce
before
mr
warner
had
a
mind
to
lower
him
a
little
and
thought
by
putting
him
in
mind
of
his
danger
somewhat
to
allay
his
transports
mrs
arnold
consent
to
make
you
happy
said
he
fills
me
with
extreme
joy
but
it
is
not
now
a
time
to
indulge
it
you
are
here
in
peril
of
your
life
you
must
preserve
it
now
for
mrs
arnold
sake
for
mrs
arnold
sake
he
replied
with
ecstasy
yes
yes
is
now
worth
preserving
mr
warner
kinsman
friend
of
my
life
grasping
his
hand
dispose
of
me
as
you
please
you
shall
guide
all
my
steps
will
not
mrs
arnold
go
with
me
after
we
are
made
one
if
after
having
considered
what
may
be
urged
to
you
on
that
head
you
should
still
continue
to
desire
it
replied
my
cousin
she
will
without
doubt
accompany
you
but
my
dear
sir
consider
circumstanced
as
you
now
are
what
will
the
world
say
should
she
accompany
your
flight
it
will
fix
an
indelible
stain
on
her
character
which
is
dearer
to
her
than
life
and
which
i
am
sure
upon
cooler
thoughts
you
will
prize
at
an
equal
value
this
marriage
will
be
a
profound
secret
to
the
world
it
may
remain
so
as
long
as
we
please
i
have
business
in
holland
which
will
demand
my
presence
there
in
a
very
short
time
her
accompanying
me
thither
can
give
rise
to
no
suspicion
i
will
dispatch
my
affairs
with
all
possible
speed
and
conduct
her
to
you
the
joy
that
before
lighted
up
his
countenance
pursued
my
cousin
seemed
a
little
clouded
he
took
a
turn
or
two
about
the
room
as
if
to
consider
of
what
i
had
said
then
addressing
himself
jointly
to
your
brother
and
me
you
are
both
cooler
than
i
am
perhaps
you
may
judge
better
let
me
but
call
her
i
will
then
do
as
you
would
have
me
i
can
not
determine
on
anything
now
as
soon
as
my
sister
and
you
are
married
said
sir
george
i
think
faulkland
you
ought
to
get
out
of
england
with
all
the
speed
you
can
it
will
be
but
a
short
absence
sidney
will
soon
follow
you
what
do
you
purpose
doing
in
regard
to
your
son
i
had
forgot
him
cried
mr
faulkland
poor
child
my
heart
has
been
in
such
tumults
since
mr
warner
came
in
that
i
could
think
of
nothing
but
the
blessed
news
he
has
brought
me
but
i
must
not
neglect
my
boy
i
will
write
to
the
honest
servant
that
i
left
behind
he
shall
bring
him
over
you
my
dear
bidulph
will
take
care
of
him
an
opportunity
offers
of
sending
him
to
me
i
hope
there
will
be
no
need
replied
your
brother
of
sending
him
out
of
england
your
affairs
may
yet
turn
out
so
as
to
permit
your
return
into
your
own
impossible
interrupted
mr
faulkland
if
smyth
should
ever
recover
representation
of
the
other
accident
cuts
off
every
hope
he
will
not
for
his
own
sake
confess
the
truth
but
impute
the
error
of
my
fatal
hand
to
premeditated
guilt
heaven
knows
base
as
she
was
i
would
not
have
attempted
her
life
but
i
was
born
to
be
the
avenger
of
those
crimes
into
the
commission
of
which
i
perhaps
first
led
her
as
for
the
contemptible
villain
who
wronged
me
i
do
not
repent
of
the
punishment
i
inflicted
on
him
though
probably
had
i
been
allowed
a
moment
time
for
recollection
i
might
have
taken
vengeance
in
a
manner
more
worthy
of
myself
i
was
delighted
proceeded
mr
warner
to
find
him
so
cool
and
rational
in
his
reflections
he
continued
talking
calmly
and
reasonably
on
the
subject
of
his
misfortunes
but
on
the
mention
of
your
name
started
again
into
transports
but
they
now
seemed
to
be
only
those
of
joy
upon
the
prospect
of
what
was
to
happen
the
next
day
after
i
left
him
i
went
to
mr
price
who
promised
to
be
in
readiness
at
the
appointed
hour
we
were
now
got
to
the
house
of
my
brother
friend
mr
warner
led
me
up
stairs
into
the
room
where
sir
george
mr
faulkland
and
mr
price
were
sitting
together
mr
faulkland
was
so
agitated
at
the
sight
of
me
that
having
risen
to
salute
me
he
was
not
able
to
speak
but
seizing
both
my
hands
he
kissed
them
fervently
one
after
the
other
tears
dropping
on
them
as
he
held
them
to
his
lips
every
one
was
silent
we
were
all
too
much
affected
to
speak
my
brother
was
the
first
that
broke
silence
well
faulkland
said
he
have
we
not
kept
our
promise
mr
faulkland
turned
towards
him
oh
bidulph
forgive
me
for
doubting
i
am
afraid
i
have
used
you
ill
can
you
pardon
the
madness
that
i
was
driven
to
by
despair
mr
warner
mrs
arnold
i
believe
you
think
me
distracted
indeed
i
am
not
i
was
only
and
he
seemed
to
hesitate
for
a
word
weary
of
i
thought
i
had
lost
every
the
world
was
grown
a
no
one
in
it
for
me
you
formed
a
wrong
judgment
my
dear
sir
answered
mr
warner
you
find
yourself
now
with
your
sincere
friends
sir
george
and
myself
are
both
so
and
your
bride
your
dear
mrs
arnold
is
ready
to
give
you
her
hand
i
sir
said
i
and
if
your
happiness
still
depends
on
me
it
gives
me
joy
that
i
have
at
length
the
power
of
it
i
have
no
he
replied
i
can
none
it
is
all
and
he
laid
his
hand
on
his
heart
his
eyes
fixed
with
delight
on
my
face
i
beheld
him
now
my
cecilia
in
a
light
in
which
i
had
never
before
viewed
him
overwhelmed
by
misfortunes
of
which
i
accused
myself
as
being
the
author
i
saw
him
an
exile
likely
to
be
deprived
of
a
noble
fortune
his
heart
pierced
with
remorse
for
an
involuntary
crime
i
saw
too
that
he
loved
me
loved
me
with
a
fervent
and
unconquerable
passion
of
this
in
the
anguish
of
his
soul
at
a
time
when
he
was
wrought
up
to
phrenzy
he
had
given
but
too
strong
demonstration
shall
i
own
it
to
you
my
cecilia
i
think
i
never
loved
him
as
i
did
in
that
moment
my
heart
was
at
once
assailed
by
a
variety
of
passions
amongst
which
gratitude
and
the
softest
compassion
were
predominant
i
continued
silent
whilst
mr
faulkland
remained
ardently
gazing
at
me
my
brother
i
believe
thought
us
too
solemn
the
occasion
indeed
required
it
but
his
fears
for
mr
faulkland
made
him
wish
to
give
the
scene
a
livelier
turn
come
sister
said
he
let
us
not
defer
the
happy
event
for
which
we
are
now
met
we
have
no
time
to
waste
in
ceremony
you
remember
what
our
mother
used
to
say
things
fall
out
between
the
cup
and
the
lip
my
brother
rose
off
his
chair
as
he
said
this
mr
warner
taking
the
hint
approached
and
took
me
by
the
hand
let
said
he
to
mr
faulkland
have
the
happiness
of
bestowing
this
best
of
creatures
on
the
man
that
i
think
deserves
her
mr
faulkland
made
no
reply
but
in
taking
the
hand
that
my
kinsman
put
into
his
his
looks
spoke
the
rapture
that
swelled
his
heart
though
i
saw
he
put
a
constraint
upon
himself
and
endeavoured
to
assume
a
deportment
suitable
to
the
important
and
solemn
occasion
after
the
indissoluble
knot
was
tied
my
brother
desired
mr
faulkland
to
retire
with
him
into
the
next
room
for
a
few
minutes
i
concluded
it
was
in
order
to
press
his
departure
and
to
prevail
on
him
to
submit
to
going
without
me
this
i
found
afterwards
was
the
subject
of
their
conversation
they
returned
to
us
in
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
mr
countenance
less
embarrassed
than
it
was
at
going
out
of
the
room
on
their
entering
mr
price
took
his
leave
my
brother
addressed
mr
warner
and
me
faulkland
said
he
is
convinced
of
the
necessity
there
is
for
his
immediately
withdrawing
from
england
and
he
is
determined
to
depart
from
hence
at
three
morning
for
i
would
by
no
means
have
him
leave
london
by
as
we
know
not
who
may
be
on
the
watch
to
trace
his
steps
he
has
consented
that
you
sister
should
remain
behind
till
mr
warner
affairs
will
permit
him
to
conduct
you
over
in
the
mean
time
master
faulkland
is
to
be
brought
from
ireland
and
if
you
should
not
be
ready
to
depart
before
his
arrival
you
may
take
him
over
with
you
to
holland
mr
faulkland
seemed
rather
to
my
brother
to
make
this
explanation
for
him
than
to
assent
chearfully
to
it
mr
warner
and
i
however
laid
hold
of
it
and
immediately
entered
into
discourse
on
the
subject
of
our
domestic
concerns
and
the
measures
proper
to
be
observed
on
so
critical
an
occasion
mr
faulkland
joined
in
the
conversation
with
the
utmost
composure
and
to
my
unspeakable
joy
seemed
perfectly
settled
and
collected
in
his
mind
i
thought
indeed
he
appeared
a
little
constrained
and
that
he
seemed
to
keep
a
constant
guard
over
himself
lest
he
should
betray
any
symptom
of
a
too
much
heated
imagination
but
my
kinsman
afterwards
observed
with
pleasure
to
me
that
this
denoted
nothing
more
than
a
consciousness
in
mr
faulkland
of
the
unhappy
wandering
that
had
before
so
much
alarmed
us
all
and
into
which
he
was
sure
there
was
not
the
least
danger
of
his
relapsing
as
his
heart
was
now
perfectly
at
ease
mr
faulkland
told
us
he
had
letters
to
write
to
ireland
which
he
would
dispatch
that
he
might
have
nothing
to
interrupt
the
few
short
hours
we
had
to
pass
together
in
the
evening
mr
warner
said
he
had
business
to
do
that
called
him
away
but
that
he
would
return
after
dinner
and
my
brother
that
mr
faulkland
might
be
quite
undisturbed
proposed
my
going
home
with
him
and
that
we
should
come
back
together
in
the
afternoon
mr
faulkland
did
not
object
to
this
and
i
went
with
sir
george
we
returned
early
in
the
afternoon
to
mr
faulkland
as
my
brother
had
let
his
friend
into
our
secret
we
passed
up
stairs
without
any
notice
being
taken
of
us
mr
faulkland
had
writ
two
letters
one
of
them
very
long
to
mr
bond
which
he
gave
my
brother
to
read
but
i
know
not
the
contents
of
it
the
other
was
to
that
careful
honest
servant
whom
he
had
mentioned
to
us
with
orders
to
bring
over
master
faulkland
with
all
convenient
speed
and
put
him
into
sir
george
hand
mr
warner
but
just
called
in
upon
us
in
the
evening
he
said
he
had
been
making
the
necessary
preparations
for
mr
faulkland
journey
and
that
having
resolved
himself
to
attend
him
as
far
as
harwich
he
would
at
the
hour
appointed
call
on
him
in
a
coach
which
should
carry
them
a
few
miles
out
of
town
where
the
horses
were
to
wait
for
them
worthy
compassionate
and
generous
kinsman
how
i
love
you
for
the
honest
warmth
of
your
heart
my
brother
and
mr
faulkland
had
a
great
deal
of
discourse
about
the
necessary
measures
that
were
to
be
taken
by
us
all
and
we
passed
the
evening
in
a
kind
of
chastened
satisfaction
which
could
not
arise
to
happiness
from
the
near
prospect
we
had
of
parting
about
ten
my
brother
took
an
affectionate
leave
of
his
friend
he
excused
himself
from
accompanying
him
on
his
journey
on
account
of
lady
sarah
not
being
well
to
see
a
parting
would
at
another
time
have
deeply
affected
me
but
my
own
hour
of
separation
drew
near
it
came
and
mr
warner
punctual
to
his
time
hurried
mr
faulkland
almost
by
force
into
the
coach
and
drove
off
with
him
i
threw
myself
into
a
chair
which
he
had
ordered
for
me
and
was
carried
home
i
went
not
to
bed
but
had
recourse
to
my
pen
god
preserve
my
dear
fugitive
i
can
do
nothing
but
weep
my
mind
was
too
much
unsettled
yesterday
to
dictate
any
thing
coherent
i
am
now
thank
heaven
more
composed
sir
george
and
lady
sarah
have
been
with
me
during
the
greatest
part
of
the
day
both
kind
and
consoling
my
brother
seems
to
have
all
his
former
affection
for
me
revived
in
his
heart
he
is
indeed
charmed
with
my
justice
as
he
calls
it
lady
sarah
who
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
is
no
way
concerned
about
this
event
affects
however
to
think
as
her
husband
does
and
commends
me
for
my
generosity
i
feel
myself
easier
in
proportion
as
i
think
mr
faulkland
gets
farther
out
of
the
reach
of
danger
sir
george
says
by
this
time
he
may
be
on
his
voyage
i
shall
certainly
wait
till
the
child
arrives
in
order
to
take
him
with
me
my
two
little
girls
will
be
fond
of
such
a
brother
for
he
is
a
charming
boy
my
brother
flatters
me
with
a
possibility
at
least
of
major
recovering
and
if
so
he
says
that
mr
faulkland
may
stand
his
trial
for
the
other
accident
as
he
is
in
hopes
smyth
will
not
persist
in
his
villainy
so
far
as
to
add
perjury
to
his
other
crimes
i
have
but
little
expectations
of
justice
from
so
bad
a
man
but
i
would
not
discourage
my
friends
in
their
endeavours
to
comfort
me
mr
warner
is
returned
from
harwich
after
having
seen
mr
faulkland
safe
on
board
the
packet
and
even
under
sail
for
holland
what
a
benevolent
heart
has
this
good
relation
of
mine
indeed
i
dearly
love
and
respect
him
his
return
has
revived
my
spirits
and
i
begin
to
lose
my
fears
he
brought
me
a
short
letter
from
mr
faulkland
short
it
is
but
his
heart
speaks
in
every
syllable
of
it
i
will
not
give
you
the
contents
my
cecilia
you
will
think
it
too
extravagant
too
romantic
for
a
husband
to
write
so
to
his
wife
i
long
yet
dread
to
hear
accounts
from
ireland
i
fear
that
wretched
smyth
is
dead
no
mail
has
arrived
from
thence
these
eight
days
contrary
winds
they
tell
me
detain
the
packets
on
the
other
side
very
often
for
a
fortnight
together
if
that
be
so
how
fortunate
was
mr
faulkland
in
seizing
on
a
lucky
hour
for
his
departure
from
the
irish
shore
i
suppose
mr
bond
family
whom
he
must
have
rendered
very
unhappy
particularly
the
daughter
are
all
now
his
implacable
enemies
and
are
tormenting
themselves
in
being
detained
from
the
pursuit
of
their
vengeance
but
let
them
come
now
when
they
will
he
is
far
out
of
the
reach
of
his
foes
i
would
it
were
possible
for
my
cecilia
to
arrive
in
england
before
my
departure
for
holland
indeed
my
dear
i
shall
not
be
sorry
if
i
am
detained
from
mr
faulkland
till
i
have
the
happiness
of
first
embracing
you
as
our
separation
may
be
afterwards
of
a
long
continuance
i
shall
wait
for
the
arrival
of
master
faulkland
and
who
knows
what
adverse
winds
may
detain
him
till
your
return
o
that
i
may
pass
though
it
be
but
one
day
with
the
dear
companion
of
my
youth
before
we
are
again
divided
i
will
not
send
this
packet
off
till
i
am
ready
to
depart
from
england
as
that
will
be
closing
an
important
period
of
my
life
what
would
i
give
that
my
dearest
friend
would
come
and
instead
of
this
tedious
narrative
which
i
have
written
receive
the
account
from
my
own
lips
if
my
wishes
should
not
be
granted
in
this
can
not
you
make
holland
your
way
home
mr
faulkland
purposes
staying
at
the
hague
till
i
go
to
him
cecilia
have
i
been
a
murmurer
at
the
decrees
of
providence
have
i
been
an
impious
repiner
when
heaven
has
poured
down
its
wrath
upon
my
head
if
not
why
am
i
marked
out
for
divine
vengeance
before
i
lose
my
senses
or
my
life
for
both
i
can
not
retain
hear
the
last
act
of
your
friend
tragic
story
my
brother
called
on
me
this
day
he
gave
me
a
letter
directed
to
mr
faulkland
which
came
under
a
cover
to
him
read
it
said
he
it
is
from
ireland
and
may
contain
something
material
for
us
to
know
it
was
from
the
honest
servant
mr
faulkland
left
behind
him
see
what
he
says
and
then
tell
me
if
i
ought
to
live
any
longer
sir
have
the
happiness
to
send
you
a
piece
of
good
news
which
made
me
wish
for
wings
to
have
flown
over
to
you
with
it
lady
heaven
be
praised
is
not
dead
nor
so
much
as
hurt
i
am
thankful
for
this
sir
on
your
account
not
her
do
know
what
possessed
the
people
at
mr
bond
to
tell
me
she
was
dead
the
mistake
to
be
sure
was
occasioned
by
the
great
confusion
the
family
were
thrown
into
and
indeed
from
what
i
myself
saw
i
was
sure
she
was
actually
dead
smyth
lived
the
surgeon
came
but
had
been
speechless
for
two
or
three
hours
and
died
whilst
his
wound
was
probing
lady
had
only
fallen
into
a
fit
and
the
major
having
bled
prodigiously
she
received
a
great
deal
of
his
blood
upon
her
linen
and
as
he
afterwards
contrived
to
throw
himself
on
the
bed
which
was
at
some
distance
from
the
place
where
she
had
fallen
it
gave
occasion
to
mrs
bond
who
was
herself
the
first
person
that
entered
the
room
after
the
sad
accident
on
finding
my
lady
lying
senseless
pale
and
bloody
on
the
floor
to
suppose
she
had
been
killed
alarm
ran
through
the
family
and
was
confirmed
to
me
by
every
one
in
it
as
we
servants
soon
quitted
the
chamber
and
the
major
himself
said
that
you
had
discharged
one
of
the
pistols
at
your
lady
and
the
other
at
him
returned
to
mr
bond
in
the
morning
after
you
were
gone
off
to
enquire
whether
major
smyth
was
alive
or
not
he
was
just
then
dead
informed
me
that
my
lady
to
their
great
surprize
was
recovered
having
only
been
in
a
fainting
fit
which
held
her
above
an
hour
without
her
shewing
any
signs
of
life
and
that
she
had
fallen
from
one
to
another
morning
and
she
farther
said
begging
your
honour
pardon
it
would
be
no
great
matter
if
she
had
died
in
one
for
she
believed
it
was
for
no
good
she
went
into
the
major
room
at
that
time
of
the
night
staid
about
the
house
all
the
day
to
pick
up
what
intelligence
i
could
from
the
servants
young
mr
bond
with
two
or
three
men
went
to
your
house
and
not
finding
you
there
i
suppose
rode
in
pursuit
of
you
but
heaven
be
praised
you
have
escaped
their
hands
who
is
a
very
civil
young
woman
told
me
in
the
evening
that
my
lady
being
come
a
little
to
herself
though
i
believe
not
in
her
right
mind
was
informed
of
the
death
at
which
she
was
so
exceedingly
terrified
that
finding
herself
ill
besides
she
confessed
the
whole
truth
of
the
matter
and
proved
that
the
major
died
with
a
lie
in
his
mouth
so
that
i
hope
mr
bond
family
will
not
be
so
spiteful
as
to
prosecute
the
affair
any
farther
lady
was
sent
home
directly
in
the
chariot
as
they
could
not
bear
the
sight
of
her
any
longer
in
the
house
she
takes
on
mightily
but
we
all
bless
ourselves
that
she
is
alive
shall
make
bold
to
inclose
this
according
to
your
order
to
sir
george
bidulph
and
as
soon
as
i
receive
your
commands
about
master
shall
make
no
delay
in
this
unlucky
place
i
am
sir
dutiful
and
obedient
servant
hildy
adieu
my
cecilia
adieu
nothing
but
my
death
should
close
such
a
scene
as
this
here
to
the
editor
great
disappointment
mrs
arnold
interesting
story
broke
off
that
unhappy
lady
not
having
continued
her
journal
any
farther
but
as
this
seemed
to
be
one
of
the
most
affecting
periods
of
her
life
his
curiosity
induced
him
to
enquire
of
the
gentleman
from
whom
he
received
those
papers
whether
he
could
give
him
any
farther
light
into
her
story
as
he
thought
it
not
improbable
that
he
might
have
learned
from
his
mother
some
other
particulars
relating
to
her
his
friend
told
him
that
he
knew
his
mother
had
drawn
up
a
narrative
of
the
subsequent
remarkable
events
in
the
life
of
mrs
arnold
at
the
request
of
a
particular
friend
that
he
had
once
heard
it
read
but
as
he
was
then
a
boy
it
made
but
little
impression
upon
him
that
afterwards
when
he
wanted
to
have
his
curiosity
gratified
his
mother
told
him
she
could
not
find
the
manuscript
and
feared
it
was
lost
however
he
said
he
would
search
her
papers
and
if
he
recovered
it
it
should
be
at
his
service
after
some
time
the
gentleman
informed
the
editor
that
he
had
made
the
strictest
scrutiny
into
his
mother
papers
and
could
find
nothing
relative
to
the
subject
of
mrs
arnold
excepting
a
few
loose
sheets
which
seemed
to
have
been
the
foul
copy
of
the
beginning
of
her
narrative
and
at
the
same
time
put
them
into
his
hands
these
the
editor
offers
to
the
publick
as
he
received
them
without
any
alteration
or
addition
cecilia
narrative
being
a
supplement
to
mrs
arnold
journal
i
set
out
on
my
return
to
england
immediately
after
the
receipt
of
her
last
journal
the
melancholy
close
of
which
had
exceedingly
terrified
and
afflicted
me
immediately
on
my
arrival
in
london
i
flew
to
the
dear
friend
of
my
heart
she
was
still
at
her
house
in
i
found
the
dear
sidney
alone
in
her
she
had
been
prepared
to
receive
me
but
though
i
had
endeavoured
to
arm
myself
with
resolution
for
this
affecting
interview
i
was
not
mistress
of
myself
at
the
sight
of
her
the
tears
i
shed
did
not
spring
from
that
sweet
emotion
which
long
severed
friends
feel
at
seeing
each
other
again
i
wept
in
sorrow
for
the
heavy
misfortunes
of
the
best
of
women
but
mrs
arnold
still
herself
and
superior
to
adversity
received
me
with
the
tenderest
marks
of
friendship
and
with
a
composure
that
amazed
me
piety
meekness
and
patience
were
ever
mrs
arnold
characteristics
and
they
now
all
appeared
blended
and
so
strongly
impressed
on
her
beautiful
face
that
i
could
not
look
at
her
without
admiration
as
i
was
astonished
to
find
her
so
calm
under
so
trying
an
affliction
i
could
not
help
expressing
myself
to
that
purpose
but
mrs
arnold
checked
me
with
this
reply
have
been
set
up
as
a
mark
my
cecilia
let
me
fulfil
the
intention
of
my
maker
by
shewing
a
perfect
resignation
to
his
will
i
hope
my
task
is
almost
finished
and
that
he
will
soon
permit
me
to
return
to
the
dust
from
which
i
came
frederick
hildy
had
arrived
from
ireland
above
a
fortnight
before
with
master
faulkland
a
beautiful
child
of
about
five
years
old
they
were
both
lodged
in
mrs
arnold
house
she
told
me
that
sir
george
bidulph
and
mr
warner
had
set
out
together
for
holland
immediately
after
the
receipt
of
the
letter
which
informed
them
of
mrs
faulkland
being
alive
my
brother
said
mrs
arnold
thought
it
necessary
himself
to
be
the
bearer
of
news
so
fatal
in
its
import
to
his
friend
he
hoped
besides
he
should
be
able
to
return
and
stand
his
trial
for
having
killed
major
smyth
as
there
is
no
doubt
of
his
being
acquitted

bond

being
now
convinced
from
mrs
faulkland
own
confession
that
there
was
nothing
premeditated
in
this
fatal
event
and
that
what
mr
faulkland
did
was
in
defence
of
his
own
life
i
have
writ
continued
she
to
mr
faulkland
to
endeavour
to
console
him
under
our
mutual
misfortune
at
my
request
she
shewed
me
a
copy
of
this
letter
wherein
she
assured
him
she
would
take
the
tenderest
care
of
his
son
the
child
could
be
delivered
safe
into
his
hands
and
conjured
him
for
that
sake
to
be
careful
of
his
own
interest
and
preservation
adding
that
as
their
ill
fated
marriage
was
an
absolute
secret
to
every
one
but
the
persons
immediately
concerned
she
hoped
he
would
not
suffer
the
thoughts
of
it
to
break
in
upon
his
future
quiet
and
concluded
with
beseeching
him
to
forget
her
as
they
were
never
more
to
meet
this
was
the
substance
of
what
she
wrote
there
were
no
murmurings
at
her
fate
no
womanish
complainings
mixed
with
the
tender
yet
noble
sentiments
of
her
heart
she
endeavoured
to
conceal
her
own
anguish
under
the
mask
of
contentment
that
mr
faulkland
might
the
better
support
this
final
destruction
of
all
his
hopes
i
asked
her
whether
she
had
heard
since
from
mr
faulkland
she
told
me
she
had
as
yet
received
no
answer
from
him
to
this
letter
but
that
she
had
heard
severally
from
sir
george
and
mr
warner
who
both
informed
her
that
mr
faulkland
after
his
first
transports
of
surprize
and
grief
were
over
at
receiving
this
new
and
unexpected
blow
had
grown
more
calm
and
seemed
inclined
to
return
with
them
to
england
sir
george
added
in
the
last
letter
she
had
from
him
that
they
only
waited
mr
warner
had
accomplished
the
business
that
he
had
to
do
in
holland
and
hoped
before
a
fortnight
was
at
an
end
to
return
home
and
to
have
the
pleasure
of
conducting
mr
faulkland
back
it
is
ten
days
continued
mrs
arnold
since
i
received
this
account
and
i
flatter
myself
that
they
may
now
be
on
their
journey
homeward
mrs
arnold
said
that
she
waited
but
for
sir
george
return
in
order
to
deliver
master
faulkland
into
his
hands
and
that
she
then
meant
to
retire
into
the
country
with
her
two
children
and
patty
the
faithful
companion
and
partner
of
her
grief
lady
sarah
bidulph
who
would
gladly
have
gone
with
sir
george
to
holland
had
been
persuaded
by
him
to
stay
behind
in
order
to
bear
his
sister
company
in
her
affliction
and
mrs
arnold
said
she
had
dedicated
much
of
her
time
to
that
friendly
purpose
her
ladyship
came
to
pay
her
a
visit
whilst
i
was
there
i
had
never
seen
lady
sarah
before
and
we
were
introduced
to
each
other
i
took
my
leave
of
mrs
arnold
and
promised
to
see
her
again
the
next
day
in
the
morning
as
i
was
preparing
to
go
to
her
i
received
a
note
from
lady
sarah
bidulph
earnestly
requesting
the
favour
of
seeing
me
at
her
house
in
st
james
square
before
i
went
to
mrs
arnold
i
obeyed
this
unexpected
summons
and
immediately
waited
on
her
i
took
the
liberty
madam
said
she
of
desiring
to
see
you
here
this
morning
at
sir
george
request
he
arrived
late
last
night
and
brings
most
melancholy
news
from
holland
sir
george
entered
the
room
while
she
spoke
after
the
first
greeting
of
friends
long
parted
were
over
i
am
afraid
to
ask
sir
george
said
i
yet
am
impatient
to
learn
something
of
mr
faulkland
your
lady
has
terribly
alarmed
me
mr
faulkland
is
not
returned
i
dare
not
enquire
the
reason
tears
instantly
sprung
into
sir
george
eyes
he
returns
no
more
said
he
his
remains
are
soon
to
be
conveyed
to
england
to
be
laid
with
his
ancestors
ah
sir
cried
i
what
will
poor
mrs
arnold
say
to
this
fresh
misfortune
it
was
on
that
account
madam
he
replied
that
we
are
now
requested
to
speak
with
you
before
you
saw
my
sister
you
who
are
her
bosom
friend
can
more
tenderly
disclose
this
melancholy
event
than
any
one
i
have
not
the
courage
to
see
her
we
must
beg
of
you
dear
madam
to
prepare
the
unhappy
sidney
for
the
news
i
asked
him
the
manner
of
mr
faulkland
death
i
can
not
positively
say
answered
sir
george
but
much
i
fear
he
precipitated
his
own
fate
mr
warner
or
i
constantly
staid
with
him
from
the
time
we
disclosed
the
fatal
account
we
brought
concerning
mrs
faulkland
knowing
as
we
did
the
violence
of
his
temper
we
were
apprehensive
of
sudden
and
dreadful
consequences
but
he
deceived
us
both
for
after
the
first
starts
of
passion
were
over
which
though
they
shocked
did
not
alarm
us
as
we
expected
them
he
assumed
a
calm
resignation
to
his
fate
and
talked
with
such
a
rational
composure
of
the
strange
circumstances
of
this
incident
that
we
began
to
entertain
hopes
that
the
efforts
of
his
reason
joined
to
our
constant
endeavours
to
sooth
and
console
him
would
in
time
so
far
succeed
and
though
we
never
expected
to
see
him
restored
to
a
tranquil
state
of
mind
we
yet
flattered
ourselves
he
would
submit
to
life
upon
such
terms
as
providence
thought
fit
to
impose
on
him
i
was
with
him
proceeded
sir
george
when
he
received
a
letter
from
my
sister
his
hands
shook
so
on
perceiving
by
the
superscription
that
it
came
from
her
that
he
let
the
letter
drop
read
it
for
me
bidulph
said
he
and
tell
me
how
it
fares
with
mrs
arnold
i
instantly
complied
with
his
request
i
found
by
the
date
of
the
letter
that
it
had
been
delayed
much
longer
than
it
ought
to
have
been
which
i
immediately
observed
to
him
as
he
had
often
expressed
his
uneasiness
at
not
hearing
from
my
sister
mrs
arnold
is
well
said
i
giving
him
the
letter
read
what
it
says
and
let
her
teach
you
fortitude
he
withdrew
to
a
window
to
peruse
it
after
he
had
read
it
i
admire
your
sister
stoicism
said
he
stepping
back
to
his
chair
this
is
true
philosophy
laying
his
finger
on
the
letter
which
he
still
held
in
his
hand
heroic
soul
is
still
unmoved
and
above
the
reach
of
adversity
happy
mrs
arnold
what
a
vain
fool
was
i
to
think
that
such
a
mind
as
could
be
subdued
he
paused
and
seemed
for
a
while
buried
in
thought
then
putting
the
letter
up
in
his
pocket
he
began
to
discourse
on
some
other
topic
we
passed
the
evening
together
continued
sir
george
and
though
faulkland
was
far
from
being
chearful
i
thought
he
appeared
more
tranquil
than
he
had
done
since
my
arrival
i
talked
to
him
of
his
returning
to
england
with
me
he
said
with
a
smile
i
think
i
ought
to
go
if
it
were
for
no
other
reason
but
that
i
may
have
my
dust
mingled
with
that
of
my
forefathers
and
this
office
bidulph
i
expect
from
you
if
you
should
outlive
me
i
laughed
at
him
and
said
i
thought
he
had
a
much
more
material
reason
that
pressed
his
return
your
estate
said
i
is
unsettled
and
if
you
were
to
die
abroad
in
the
predicament
in
which
you
now
stand
what
is
to
become
of
your
son
i
have
already
done
for
my
son
said
he
all
that
i
thought
in
justice
was
in
my
power
to
do
i
have
long
ago
settled
my
personal
fortune
on
him
that
in
case
my
next
heirs
should
on
account
of
the
illegitimacy
of
his
birth
claim
the
family
estate
he
may
have
a
handsome
support
without
it
and
indeed
i
never
wished
to
debar
my
lawful
heirs
in
favour
of
this
child
though
i
love
him
tenderly
and
they
are
worthless
people
whom
i
despise
and
with
whom
i
never
had
any
intercourse
i
replied
if
that
were
so
as
the
manner
of
the
child
birth
was
a
secret
i
wished
he
might
undisturbed
inherit
his
father
fortune
when
he
should
come
to
pay
the
last
debt
to
nature
he
answered
where
such
a
vast
property
was
at
stake
there
would
not
be
people
wanting
whose
interest
would
engage
them
to
discover
the
secret
and
he
doubted
not
but
the
irregularity
of
his
wife
conduct
had
already
occasioned
enquiries
to
be
made
supposing
said
i
you
had
had
another
son
by
mrs
faulkland
since
your
marriage
as
you
could
have
no
objection
to
the
bequeathing
your
fortune
to
him
would
it
not
have
appeared
strange
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
that
you
should
disinherit
your
eldest
son
it
might
have
appeared
so
said
he
but
i
certainly
should
have
done
it
and
for
that
reason
as
i
have
no
child
but
him
i
have
made
such
a
disposition
of
my
fortune
as
i
now
tell
you
if
i
live
i
may
increase
my
son
patrimony
if
not
he
must
be
contented
with
that
which
i
have
bequeathed
to
him
and
let
my
kindred
scramble
for
the
rest
we
staid
together
till
it
was
late
he
discoursed
on
a
variety
of
subjects
but
mentioned
not
my
sister
name
during
the
whole
time
i
thought
i
left
him
well
and
his
mind
tolerably
composed
we
were
to
set
out
on
our
return
in
six
days
but
an
account
was
brought
to
me
in
the
morning
that
mr
faulkland
was
found
dead
in
his
bed
there
were
no
symptoms
discovered
on
the
body
that
could
let
us
into
the
occasion
of
his
death
but
as
my
own
fears
suggested
too
much
i
chose
not
to
be
particular
in
my
enquiries
wishing
rather
that
his
fatal
story
should
be
buried
in
silence
mr
warner
found
that
his
affairs
were
likely
to
delay
him
longer
than
the
time
proposed
and
as
i
had
nothing
farther
to
detain
me
in
holland
i
set
out
the
day
after
my
unfortunate
friend
death
leaving
to
mr
warner
the
care
of
conveying
his
remains
to
england
agreeably
to
the
desire
he
had
expressed
which
i
now
considered
as
his
last
injunction
laid
on
me
thus
proceeded
sir
george
by
a
series
of
fatal
events
each
of
which
was
occasioned
by
motives
in
themselves
laudable
has
one
of
the
bravest
and
most
men
on
earth
been
cut
off
in
the
prime
of
his
youth
o
faulkland
why
did
you
suffer
that
gallant
spirit
to
be
vanquished
sir
george
emotion
stopped
his
farther
speech
i
was
too
much
affected
to
say
any
thing
to
him
but
took
a
hasty
leave
of
lady
sarah
in
order
to
go
to
mrs
arnold
as
soon
as
i
entered
my
friend
room
cecilia
said
she
if
your
countenance
be
as
faithful
an
interpreter
of
your
mind
as
it
used
to
be
you
have
some
thing
disastrous
to
relate
you
may
say
anything
misfortune
and
i
have
been
so
familiar
i
shall
not
shrink
as
its
approach
sir
george
is
returned
i
replied
you
will
see
him
is
he
come
alone
she
asked
alone
i
replied
you
but
repeat
my
words
cecilia
without
adding
any
thing
from
yourself
shall
i
interpret
the
meaning
of
that
mournful
echo
mr
faulkland
no
longer
lives
i
was
silent
oh
i
knew
him
too
well
said
she
raising
her
voice
with
energy
to
think
he
would
survive
this
last
blow
his
death
was
natural
said
i
for
any
thing
that
appears
to
the
contrary
god
be
praised
for
that
cried
mrs
arnold
so
i
am
satisfied
that
he
is
at
peace
she
then
enquired
after
mr
warner
and
her
brother
without
making
any
farther
mention
of
mr
faulkland
whilst
we
were
in
discourse
master
faulkland
ran
into
the
room
he
had
been
at
play
with
the
two
little
miss
arnolds
who
were
in
pursuit
of
him
and
he
flew
to
mrs
arnold
to
hide
him
she
folded
him
tenderly
in
her
arms
then
turning
to
me
look
at
this
boy
said
she
he
is
the
perfect
image
of
his
father
when
am
i
to
go
to
my
papa
cried
the
child
as
he
hung
round
her
neck
this
innocent
unexpected
demand
quite
vanquished
mrs
arnold
fortitude
she
set
him
down
without
being
able
to
answer
his
question
then
said
excuse
me
my
cecilia
i
would
wish
to
be
alone
for
it
was
not
yet
a
season
to
administer
consolation
and
i
withdrew
she
staid
in
london
but
two
days
after
this
when
as
she
had
before
resolved
she
retired
to
an
estate
in
buckinghamshire
which
her
kinsman
had
purchased
and
settled
on
her
for
ever
with
her
brother
consent
she
took
master
faulkland
with
her
and
prevailed
on
mr
price
to
accompany
her
into
the
country
to
whom
she
committed
the
care
of
the
child
education
mr
warner
whom
she
had
acquainted
by
letter
with
her
intention
approved
of
the
step
she
had
taken
he
returned
to
england
in
about
three
weeks
after
her
departure
from
her
house
in
town
which
she
had
left
for
his
reception
just
as
he
had
fitted
it
up
for
her
before
i
accompany
mrs
arnold
into
her
solitude
i
shall
just
briefly
mention
some
other
persons
who
were
connected
with
her
story
the
relations
of
mr
faulkland
as
he
had
foreseen
claimed
his
estate
and
at
length
obtained
it
the
illegitimacy
of
the
child
being
proved
the
wretched
mrs
faulkland
abandoned
and
despised
returned
to
england
but
as
she
was
there
hated
and
shunned
by
every
one
she
remained
in
obscurity
for
a
few
years
and
then
died
unpitied
and
unlamented
i
now
return
to
mrs
arnold
who
settled
in
her
quiet
retreat
in
the
country
it
might
be
hoped
would
have
passed
the
remainder
of
her
days
undisturbed
by
any
new
calamity
that
only
source
of
true
heroism
of
soul
religion
had
all
along
supported
and
prevented
her
from
sinking
under
the
most
trying
afflictions
many
and
bitter
were
the
sufferings
she
had
already
endured
but
she
was
to
use
her
own
words
up
as
a
and
the
deep
afflictions
that
still
pursued
her
and
clouded
even
her
latter
days
with
misfortunes
may
serve
to
shew
that
it
is
not
that
true
virtue
is
to
look
for
its
reward
i
saw
her
at
a
time
when
this
reflection
as
it
had
been
her
chief
so
was
it
her
last
and
only
consolation
possessed
as
she
was
of
an
admirable
understanding
and
an
enlarged
mind
in
the
deepest
solitude
she
had
always
resources
of
entertainment
within
herself
her
natural
disposition
ever
sweet
and
complying
was
improved
by
her
sufferings
into
a
patience
very
rare
in
woman
and
a
resignation
imbibed
at
first
from
a
rigid
education
was
heightened
by
religion
into
an
almost
meekness
and
humility
i
shall
pass
over
the
first
ten
years
of
her
retirement
in
which
nothing
material
happened
but
the
marriage
of
the
amiable
patty
main
to
a
gentleman
of
a
large
estate
and
the
death
of
her
worthy
kinsman
mr
warner
who
bequeathed
her
his
whole
fortune
miss
arnold
her
eldest
daughter
was
now
something
more
than
fifteen
and
fulfilled
the
promise
her
childhood
gave
of
her
being
a
perfect
beauty
miss
cecilia
was
about
a
year
younger
and
though
not
so
handsome
as
her
sister
was
accounted
one
of
the
finest
young
ladies
of
her
time
with
what
delight
have
i
seen
this
excellent
mother
while
these
two
charming
young
creatures
were
all
attention
relate
to
them
the
extraordinary
and
affecting
incidents
of
her
life
this
said
she
i
do
not
as
a
murmurer
at
my
fate
nor
to
move
your
pity
at
my
misfortunes
but
to
teach
you
by
my
example
that
there
is
no
situation
in
life
exempt
from
trouble
it
found
under
the
tender
care
of
the
best
of
parents
it
pursued
me
into
my
husband
house
in
my
virgin
state
when
i
was
a
wife
and
in
my
widowhood
i
was
equally
persecuted
poverty
i
once
thought
would
have
exempted
me
from
every
ill
but
what
its
own
hand
inflicted
and
had
it
remained
my
companion
the
bitterest
misfortune
of
my
love
would
have
been
prevented
for
if
wealth
had
not
accompanied
my
hand
the
world
could
not
have
persuaded
me
to
yield
it
to
mr
faulkland
do
not
therefore
pride
yourselves
on
the
great
fortunes
you
are
likely
to
possess
i
have
received
no
other
satisfaction
in
mine
than
what
arose
from
the
benefits
i
have
conferred
on
others
by
such
lessons
as
these
did
this
tender
parent
endeavour
to
fortify
their
young
minds
against
the
vicissitudes
of
fortune
and
to
teach
them
not
to
place
their
confidence
in
riches
she
dwelt
so
often
upon
this
theme
that
she
seemed
to
have
a
presentiment
of
those
evils
which
were
now
ready
to
pour
in
like
a
torrent
upon
her
gracious
heaven
how
inscrutable
are
thy
ways
her
affluent
fortune
the
very
circumstance
which
seemed
to
promise
her
in
the
eve
of
life
some
compensation
for
the
miseries
she
had
endured
in
her
early
days
now
proved
the
source
of
new
and
dreadful
calamities
to
her
which
by
involving
the
unhappy
daughters
of
an
unhappy
mother
in
scenes
of
the
most
exquisite
distress
cut
off
from
her
even
the
last
resource
of
hope
in
this
life
and
rendered
the
close
of
her
history
still
more
here
the
lady
narrative
breaks
off
and
the
editor
not
having
it
in
his
power
after
the
most
diligent
enquiry
to
recover
any
more
of
the
manuscript
is
to
his
great
mortification
compelled
to
offer
this
fragment
end
of
third
volume
transcriber
notes
spelling
varies
and
is
generally
retained
however
there
were
a
number
of
errors
which
involved
transposition
of
characters
as
well
as
missing
or
redundant
characters
which
were
most
likely
made
by
the
printer
these
have
been
checked
against
a
contemporary
edition
and
corrected
where
necessary
the

not
always
hyphenated

are
