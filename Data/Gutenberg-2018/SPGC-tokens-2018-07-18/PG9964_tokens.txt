the

intimate

are
but
the
deliberately
adopted
reactions
of
human
characters
upon

there
are
certain
persons
who
independently
of

or
comeliness
arouse
an
instant
curiosity
concerning
themselves
the

its
members
unmistakable
they
may
possess
neither

nor
that
adroitness
of
which

there
is
about
them
this

which
proclaims
that
they
have
overtaken

most
of

arrested
a
moment
by
their
presence
to
snatch
the
definition
their
peculiarity
exacts
are
aware
that
on
the
heels
of
curiosity
follows
envy
they
know
the
very
things
that
we
forever
seek
in
vain
and
this
diagnosis
achieved
as
it
were
comes
near
to
the
truth
for
the
hallmark
of
such
persons
is
that
they
have
found
and
come
into
their
own
there
is
a
sign
upon
the
face
and
in
the
eyes
having
somehow
discovered
the
that
makes
them
free
of
the
whole
amazing
puzzle
they
know
where
they
belong
and
therefore
whither
they
are
bound
more
they
are
definitely
the
littlenesses
of
existence
that
plague
the
majority
pass
them
by
for
this
reason
if
for
no
other
continued
i
count
my
experience
with
that
man
as
memorable
beyond
ordinary
for
no
other
because
from
the
very
beginning
there
was
another
indeed
it
was
probably
his
air
of
unusual
bigness
massiveness
rather
head
face
eyes
shoulders
especially
back
and
shoulders
that
struck
me
first
when
i
caught
sight
of
him
lounging
there
hugely
upon
my
steamer
deck
at
marseilles
winning
my
instant
attention
before
he
turned
and
the
expression
on
his
great
face
woke
more
woke
curiosity
interest
envy
he
wore
this
very
look
of
certainty
that
knows
yet
with
a
tinge
of
mild
surprise
as
though
he
had
only
recently
known
it
was
less
than
perplexity
a
faint
astonishment
as
of
a
happy
child
almost
of
an
animal
shone
in
the
large
brown
eyes
you
mean
that
the
physical
quality
caught
you
first
then
the
psychical
i
asked
keeping
him
to
the
point
for
his
irish
imagination
was
ever
apt
to
race
away
at
a
tangent
he
laughed
acknowledging
the
check
i
believe
that
to
be
the
truth
he
replied
his
face
instantly
grave
again
it
was
the
impression
of
uncommon
bulk
that
heated
my
intuition
blessed
if
i
know
how
leading
me
to
the
other
the
size
of
his
body
did
not
smother
as
so
often
is
the
case
with
big
people
rather
it
revealed
at
the
moment
i
could
conceive
no
possible
connection
of
course
only
this
overwhelming
attraction
of
the
man
personality
caught
me
and
i
longed
to
make
friends

the
way
with
me

know

we
find
ourselves
today
in

of
a
somewhat
peculiar
state
of
society
which
we
call
civilization
but
which
even
to
the
most
optimistic
among
us
does
not
seem
altogether
desirable
some
of
us
indeed
are
inclined
to
think
that
it
is
a
kind
of
disease
which
the
various
races
of
man
have
to
pass
through
while
history
tells
us
of
many
nations
that
have
been
attacked
by
it
of
many
that
have
succumbed
to
it
and
of
some
that
are
still
in
the
throes

condition

never

final

its

and
himself
is
an
individuality
that
invites
consideration
from
the
ruck
of
commonplace
men
of
mingled
irish
scotch
and
english
blood
the
first
predominated
and
the
celtic
element
in
him
was
strong
a
man
of
vigorous
health
careless
of
gain
a
wanderer
and
by
his
own
choice
something
of
an
outcast
he
led
to
the
end
the
existence
of
a
rolling
stone
he
lived
from
hand
to
mouth
never
quite
growing
up
it
seemed
indeed
that
he
never
could
grow
up
in
the
accepted
sense
of
the
term
for
his
motto
was
the
reverse
of
and
he
found
himself
in
a
state
of
perpetual
astonishment
at
the
mystery
of
things
he
was
forever
deciphering
the
huge
horoscope
of
life
yet
getting
no
further
than
the
house
of
wonder
on
whose
cusp
surely
he
had
been
born
civilization
he
loved
to
say
had
blinded
the
eyes
of
men
filling
them
with
dust
instead
of
vision
an
ardent
lover
of
wild
outdoor
life
he
knew
at
times
a
high
passionate
searching
for
things
of
the
spirit
when
the
outer
world
fell
away
like
dross
and
he
seemed
to
pass
into
a
state
resembling
ecstasy
never
in
cities
or
among
his
fellow
men
struggling
and
herded
did
these
times
come
to
him
but
when
he
was
abroad
with
the
winds
and
stars
in
desolate
places
then
sometimes
he
would
be
rapt
away
caught
up
to
see
the
of
the
great
procession
of
the
gods
that
had
come
near
he
surprised
eternity
in
a
running
moment
for
the
moods
of
nature
flamed
through
him
him
like
presences
potently
evocative
as
the
presences
of
persons
and
with
meanings
equally
various
the
woods
with
love
and
tenderness
the
sea
with
reverence
and
magic
plains
and
wide
horizons
with
the
melancholy
peace
and
silence
as
of
wise
and
old
companions
and
mountains
with
a
splendid
terror
due
to
some
want
of
comprehension
in
himself
caused
probably
by
a
spiritual
remoteness
from
their
mood
the
cosmos
in
a
word
for
him
was
psychical
and
nature
moods
were
transcendental
cosmic
activities
that
induced
in
him
these
singular
states
of
exaltation
and
expansion
she
pushed
wide
the
gateways
of
his
deeper
life
she
entered
took
possession
dipped
his
smaller
self
into
her
own
enormous
and
enveloping
personality
he
possessed
a
full
experience
and
at
times
a
keen
judgment
of
modern
life
while
underneath
all
the
time
lay
the
moving
sea
of
curiously
wild
primitive
instincts
an
insatiable
longing
for
the
wilderness
was
in
his
blood
a
craving
vehement
unappeasable
yet
for
something
far
greater
than
the
wilderness
alone
the
wilderness
was
merely
a
symbol
a
first
step
indication
of
a
way
of
escape
the
hurry
and
invention
of
modern
life
were
to
him
a
fever
and
a
torment
he
loathed
the
million
tricks
of
civilization
at
the
same
time
being
a
man
of
some
discrimination
at
least
he
rarely
let
himself
go
completely
of
these
wilder
simpler
instincts
he
was
afraid
they
might
flood
all
else
if
he
yielded
entirely
something
he
dreaded
without
being
able
to
define
would
happen
the
structure
of
his
being
would
suffer
a
nameless
violence
so
that
he
would
have
to
break
with
the
world
these
cravings
stood
for
that
loot
of
the
soul
which
he
must
deny
himself
complete
surrender
would
involve
somehow
a
disintegration
a
dissociation
of
his
personality
that
carried
with
it
the
loss
of
personal
identity
when
the
feeling
of
revolt
became
sometimes
so
urgent
in
him
that
it
threatened
to
become
unmanageable
he
would
go
out
into
solitude
calling
it
to
heel
but
this
attempt
to
restore
order
while
easing
his
nature
was
never
radical
the
accumulation
merely
increased
on
the
rebound
the
yearnings
grew
and
multiplied
and
the
point
of
saturation
was
often
dangerously
near
some
day
his
friends
would
say
there
be
a
bursting
of
the
dam
and
though
their
meaning
might
be
variously
interpreted
they
spoke
the
truth
knew
it
too
a
man
he
was
in
a
word
of
deep
and
moods
and
with
more
difficulty
than
most
in
recognizing
the
underlying
self
of
which
these
outer
aspects
were
projections
masquerading
as
complete
personalities
the
underlying
ego
that
unified
these
projections
was
of
the
type
touched
with
so
sure
a
hand
in
the
opening
pages
of
an
inspired
little
book
plea
of
was
useless
as
a
citizen
and
knew
it
sometimes
he
was
ashamed
of
it
as
well
occasionally
and
at
the
time
of
this
particular
memorable
adventure
aged
thirty
he
acted
as
foreign
correspondent
but
even
as
such
he
was
the
kind
of
newspaper
man
that
not
merely
collects
news
but
discovers
reveals
creates
it
wise
in
their
generation
the
editors
who
commissioned
him
remembered
when
his
copy
came
in
that
they
were
editors
a
roving
commission
among
the
tribes
of
the
caucasus
was
his
assignment
at
the
moment
and
a
better
man
for
the
purpose
would
have
been
hard
to
find
since
he
knew
beauty
had
a
keen
eye
for
human
nature
divined
what
was
vital
and
picturesque
and
had
further
the
power
to
set
it
down
in
brief
terms
born
directly
of
his
vivid
emotions
when
first
i
knew
him
he
lived
nowhere
being
always
on
the
move
he
kept
however
a
dingy
little
room
near
paddington
where
his
books
and
papers
accumulated
undusted
but
safe
and
where
the
manuscripts
of
his
adventures
were
found
when
his
death
made
me
the
executor
of
his
few
belongings
the
key
was
in
his
pocket
carefully
ticketed
with
a
bone
label
and
this
the
only
evidence
of
practical
forethought
i
ever
discovered
in
him
was
proof
that
something
in
that
room
was
deemed
by
him
of
value
to
others
it
certainly
was
not
the
heterogeneous
collection
of
books
nor
the
hundreds
of
unlabeled
photographs
and
sketches
can
it
have
been
the
mss
of
stories
notes
and
episodes
i
found
almost
carefully
piled
and
tabulated
with
titles
in
a
dirty
kitbag
of
green
willesden
canvas
some
of
these
he
had
told
me
with
a
greater
vividness
than
he
could
command
by
pen
others
were
new
many
unfinished
all
were
unusual
to
say
the
least
all
too
had
obviously
happened
to
himself
at
some
period
of
his
roving
career
though
here
and
there
he
had
disguised
his
own
part
in
them
by
hoffmann
device
of
throwing
the
action
into
the
third
person
those
told
to
me
by
word
of
mouth
i
could
only
feel
were
true
true
for
himself
at
least
in
no
sense
were
they
mere
inventions
but
arose
in
moments
of
vision
upon
a
structure
of
solid
events
ten
men
will
describe
in
as
many
different
ways
a
snake
crossing
their
path
but
besides
these
there
exists
an
eleventh
man
who
sees
more
than
the
snake
the
path
the
movement
was
some
such
eleventh
man
he
saw
the
thing
whole
from
some
kind
of
inner
view
while
the
ten
saw
only
limited
aspects
of
it
from
various
angles
he
was
accused
of
adding
details
therefore
because
he
had
divined
their
presence
while
still
below
the
horizon
before
they
emerged
the
others
had
already
left
by
which
i
mean
that
he
saw
in
commonplace
events
the
movement
of
greater
tides
than
others
saw
at
one
remove
of
time
or
distance
a
minute
or
a
mile
he
perceived
while
the
ten
chattered
volubly
about
the
name
of
the
snake
he
was
caught
beyond
by
the
beauty
of
the
path
the
glory
of
the
running
glide
the
nature
of
the
forces
that
drove
hindered
modified
the
others
reasoned
where
the
snake
was
going
its
length
in
inches
and
its
speed
per
second
while
he
ignoring
such
superficial
details
plunged
as
it
were
into
the
very
nature
of
the
creature
being
and
in
this
idiosyncrasy
which
he
shared
with
all
persons
of
mystical
temperament
is
exemplified
a
certain
curious
contempt
for
reason
that
he
had
for
him
mere
intellectuality
by
which
the
modern
world
sets
such
store
was
a
valley
of
dry
bones
its
worship
was
a
worship
of
the
form
it
missed
the
essential
inner
truth
because
such
inner
truth
could
be
known
only
by
being
it
feeling
it
the
intellectual
attitude
of
mind
in
a
word
was
critical
not
creative
and
to
be
unimaginative
seemed
to
him
therefore
the
worst
form
of
unintelligence
the
arid
sterile
minds
he
would
cry
in
a
burst
of
his
celtic
enthusiasm
where
i
ask
ye
did
the
philosophies
and
sciences
of
the
world
assist
the
progress
of
any
single
soul
a
blessed
inch
any
little
dreamer
in
his
back
spinning
by
rushlight
his
web
of
beauty
was
greater
than
the
finest
critical
intelligence
that
ever
lived
the
one
for
all
his
poor
technique
was
stammering
over
something
god
had
whispered
to
him
the
other
merely
destroying
thoughts
invented
by
the
brain
of
man
and
this
attitude
of
mind
because
of
its
interpretative
effect
upon
what
follows
justifies
mention
for
to
in
some
way
difficult
to
explain
reason
and
intellect
as
such
had
come
to
be
worshipped
by
men
today
out
of
all
proportion
to
their
real
value
consciousness
focused
too
exclusively
upon
them
had
exalted
them
out
of
due
proportion
in
the
spiritual
economy
to
make
a
god
of
them
was
to
make
an
empty
and
inadequate
god
reason
should
be
the
guardian
of
the
soul
advance
but
not
the
object
its
function
was
that
of
a
great
sandpaper
which
should
clear
the
way
of
excrescences
but
its
worship
was
to
allow
a
detail
to
assume
a
disproportionate
importance
not
that
he
was
fool
enough
to
despise
reason
in
what
he
called
its
proper
place
but
that
he
was
wise
enough
not
that
he
was
intellectual
enough
to
recognize
its
futility
in
measuring
the
things
of
the
soul
for
him
there
existed
a
more
fundamental
understanding
than
reason
and
it
was
apparently
an
inner
and
natural
understanding
the
greatest
teacher
we
ever
had
i
once
heard
him
say
ignored
the
intellect
and
who
will
ye
tell
me
can
by
searching
find
out
god
and
yet
what
else
is
worth
finding
out
is
it
only
by
becoming
as
a
little
child
a
child
that
feels
and
never
reasons
things
that
any
one
shall
enter
the
kingdom
where
will
the
giant
intellects
be
before
the
great
white
throne
when
a
simple
man
with
the
heart
of
a
child
will
top
the
lot
of
nature
i
convinced
he
said
another
time
though
he
said
it
with
puzzled
eyes
and
a
mind
obviously
groping
is
our
next
step
reason
has
done
its
best
for
centuries
and
gets
no
further
it
get
no
further
for
it
can
do
nothing
for
the
inner
life
which
is
the
sole
reality
we
must
return
to
nature
and
a
purified
intuition
to
a
greater
reliance
upon
what
is
now
subconscious
back
to
that
sweet
grave
guidance
of
the
universe
which
we
discarded
with
the
primitive
state
a
spiritual
intelligence
really
divorced
from
mere
intellectuality
and
by
nature
he
did
not
mean
a
return
to
savagery
there
was
no
idea
of
going
backwards
in
his
wild
words
rather
he
looked
forwards
in
some
way
hard
to
understand
to
a
state
when
man
with
the
best
results
of
reason
in
his
pocket
might
return
to
the
instinctive
life
to
feeling
to
the
sinking
down
of
the
modern
exaggerated
intellectual
personality
into
its
rightful
place
as
guide
instead
of
leader
he
called
it
a
return
to
nature
but
what
he
meant
i
always
felt
was
back
to
a
sense
of
kinship
with
the
universe
which
men
through
worshipping
the
intellect
alone
had
lost
men
today
prided
themselves
upon
their
superiority
to
nature
as
beings
separate
and
apart
sought
on
the
contrary
a
development
if
not
a
revival
of
some
faultless
instinct
due
to
kinship
with
her
which
to
take
extremes
shall
direct
alike
the
animal
and
the
inspired
man
guiding
the
wild
bee
and
the
homing
pigeon
and
the
soul
toward
its
god
this
clue
as
he
called
it
crystallized
so
neatly
and
so
conclusively
his
own
mental
struggles
that
he
had
called
a
halt
as
it
were
to
his
own
intellectual
development
the
name
and
family
of
the
snake
hence
meant
to
him
the
least
important
things
about
it
he
caught
wildly
yet
consistently
at
the
psychic
links
that
bound
the
snake
and
nature
and
himself
together
with
all
creation
troops
of
adventurous
thoughts
had
all
his
life
gone
west
to
colonize
this
land
of
speculative
dream
true
to
his
idea
he
thought
with
his
emotions
as
much
as
with
his
brain
and
in
the
broken
record
of
the
adventure
that
this
book
relates
this
strange
passion
of
his
temperament
remains
the
vital
clue
for
it
happened
as
well
as
to
himself
his
being
could
include
the
earth
by
feeling
with
her
whereas
his
intellect
could
merely
criticize
and
so
belittle
the
details
of
such
inclusion
many
a
time
while
he
stretched
credulity
to
a
point
i
have
heard
him
apologize
in
some
such
way
for
his
method
it
was
the
splendor
of
his
belief
that
made
the
thing
so
convincing
in
the
telling
for
later
when
i
found
the
same
tale
written
down
it
seemed
somehow
to
have
failed
of
an
equal
achievement
the
truth
was
that
no
one
language
would
convey
the
extraordinary
freight
that
was
carried
so
easily
by
his
instinctive
choice
of
gestures
tone
and
glance
with
him
these
were
consummately
interpretative
before
the
age
of
thirty
he
had
written
and
published
a
volume
or
two
of
curious
tales
all
dealing
with
extensions
of
the
personality
a
subject
that
interested
him
deeply
and
one
he
understood
because
he
drew
the
material
largely
from
himself
psychology
he
simply
devoured
even
in
its
most
fantastic
and
speculative
forms
and
though
perhaps
his
vision
was
incalculably
greater
than
his
power
of
technique
these
strange
books
had
a
certain
value
and
formed
a
genuine
contribution
to
the
thought
on
that
particular
subject
in
england
naturally
they
fell
dead
but
their
translation
into
german
brought
him
a
wider
and
more
intelligent
circle
the
common
public
unfamiliar
with
sally
beauchamp
no
with
hélène
smith
or
with
hanna
found
in
these
studies
of
divided
personality
and
these
singular
extensions
of
the
human
consciousness
only
extravagance
and
imagination
run
to
wildness
yet
none
the
less
the
substratum
of
truth
upon
which
had
built
them
lay
actually
within
his
own
personal
experience
the
books
had
brought
him
here
and
there
acquaintances
of
value
and
among
these
latter
was
a
german
doctor
heinrich
stahl
with
stahl
the
irishman
crossed
swords
through
months
of
somewhat
irregular
correspondence
until
at
length
the
two
had
met
on
board
a
steamer
where
the
german
held
the
position
of
ship
doctor
the
acquaintanceship
had
grown
into
something
approaching
friendship
although
the
two
men
stood
apparently
at
the
opposite
poles
of
thought
from
time
to
time
they
still
met
in
appearance
there
was
nothing
unusual
about
unless
it
was
the
contrast
of
the
light
blue
eyes
with
the
dark
hair
never
i
think
did
i
see
him
in
anything
but
that
old
grey
flannel
suit
with
the
low
collar
and
shabby
glistening
tie
he
was
of
medium
height
delicately
built
his
hands
more
like
a
girl
than
a
man
in
towns
he
shaved
and
looked
fairly
presentable
but
once
upon
his
travels
he
grew
beard
and
moustache
and
would
forget
for
weeks
to
have
his
hair
cut
so
that
it
fell
in
a
tangle
over
forehead
and
eyes
his
manner
changed
with
the
abruptness
of
his
moods
sometimes
active
and
alert
at
others
for
days
together
he
would
become
absent
dreamy
absorbed
half
oblivious
of
the
outer
world
his
movements
and
actions
dictated
by
subconscious
instinct
rather
than
regulated
by
volition
and
one
cause
of
that
loneliness
of
spirit
which
was
undoubtedly
a
chief
pain
in
life
to
him
was
the
fact
that
ordinary
folk
were
puzzled
how
to
take
him
or
to
know
which
of
these
many
extreme
moods
was
the
man
himself
uncomfortable
unsatisfactory
elusive
not
to
be
counted
upon
they
deemed
him
and
from
their
point
of
view
they
were
undoubtedly
right
the
sympathy
and
above
all
the
companionship
he
needed
genuinely
craved
too
were
thus
denied
to
him
by
the
faults
of
his
own
temperament
with
women
his
intercourse
was
of
the
slightest
in
a
sense
he
did
not
know
the
need
of
them
much
for
one
thing
the
feminine
element
in
his
own
nature
was
too
strong
and
he
was
not
conscious
as
most
men
are
of
the
great
gap
of
incompleteness
women
may
so
exquisitely
fill
and
for
another
its
obvious
corollary
perhaps
when
they
did
come
into
his
life
they
gave
him
more
than
he
could
comfortably
deal
with
they
offered
him
more
than
he
needed
in
this
way
while
he
perhaps
had
never
fallen
in
love
as
the
saying
has
it
he
had
certainly
known
that
high
splendor
of
devotion
which
means
the
losing
of
oneself
in
others
that
exalted
love
which
seeks
not
any
reward
of
possession
because
it
is
itself
so
utterly
possessed
he
was
pure
too
in
the
sense
that
it
never
occurred
to
him
to
be
otherwise
chief
cause
of
his
loneliness
so
far
as
i
could
judge
his
complex
personality
at
all
seemed
that
he
never
found
a
sympathetic
truly
understanding
ear
for
those
deeply
primitive
longings
that
fairly
ravaged
his
heart
and
this
very
isolation
made
him
often
afraid
it
proved
that
the
rest
of
the
world
the
sane
majority
at
any
rate
said
no
to
them
i
who
loved
him
and
listened
yet
never
quite
apprehended
his
full
meaning
far
more
than
the
common
call
of
the
wild
it
was
he
yearned
not
so
much
for
a
world
savage
uncivilized
as
for
a
perfectly
natural
one
that
had
never
known
perhaps
never
needed
civilization
a
state
of
freedom
in
a
life
unstained
he
never
wholly
understood
i
think
the
reason
why
he
found
himself
in
such
stern
protest
against
the
modern
state
of
things
why
people
produced
in
him
a
state
of
death
so
that
he
turned
from
men
to
nature
to
find
life
the
things
the
nations
exclusively
troubled
themselves
about
all
seemed
to
him
so
obviously
vain
and
worthless
and
though
he
never
even
in
his
highest
moments
felt
the
claims
of
sainthood
it
puzzled
and
perplexed
him
deeply
that
the
conquest
over
nature
in
all
its
multifarious
forms
today
should
seem
to
them
so
infinitely
more
important
than
the
conquest
over
self
what
the
world
with
common
consent
called
reality
seemed
ever
to
him
the
most
crude
and
obvious
the
most
transient
the
most
blatant
his
love
of
nature
was
more
than
the
mere
joy
of
tumultuous
pagan
instincts
it
was
in
the
kind
of
simple
life
he
craved
the
first
step
toward
the
recovery
of
noble
dignified
enfranchised
living
in
the
denial
of
all
this
external
flummery
he
hated
it
would
leave
the
soul
disengaged
and
free
able
to
turn
her
activities
within
for
spiritual
development
civilization
now
suffocated
smothered
killed
the
soul
being
in
the
hopeless
minority
he
felt
he
must
be
somewhere
wrong
at
fault
deceived
for
all
men
from
a
statesman
to
an
agreed
that
the
accumulation
of
external
possessions
had
value
and
that
the
importance
of
material
gain
was
real
yet
for
himself
he
always
turned
for
comfort
to
the
earth
the
wise
and
wonderful
earth
opened
her
mind
and
her
deep
heart
to
him
in
a
way
few
other
men
seemed
to
know
through
nature
he
could
move
along
yet
find
his
way
to
strength
and
sympathy
a
noble
gracious
life
stirred
in
him
then
which
the
pettier
human
world
denied
he
often
would
compare
the
thin
help
or
fellowship
he
gained
from
ordinary
social
intercourse
or
from
what
had
seemed
at
the
time
quite
a
successful
gathering
of
his
kind
with
the
power
he
gained
from
a
visit
to
the
woods
or
mountains
the
former
as
a
rule
evaporated
in
a
single
day
the
other
stayed
with
ever
growing
power
to
bless
whole
weeks
and
months
and
hence
it
was
whether
owing
to
the
truth
or
ignorance
of
his
attitude
that
a
sense
of
bleak
loneliness
spread
through
all
his
life
and
more
and
more
he
turned
from
men
to
nature
moreover
foolish
as
it
must
sound
i
was
sometimes
aware
that
deep
down
in
him
hid
some
nameless
indefinable
quality
that
proclaimed
him
fitted
to
live
in
conditions
that
had
never
known
the
restraints
of
modern
conventions
a
very
different
thing
to
doing
without
them
once
known
a
kind
of
childlike
transcendental
innocence
he
certainly
possessed
most
engaging
and
utterly
impossible
it
showed
itself
indirectly
i
think
in
this
distress
under
modern
conditions
the
multifarious
apparatus
of
the
spirit
of
today
oppressed
him
its
rush
and
luxury
and
artificiality
harassed
him
beyond
belief
the
terror
of
cities
ran
in
his
very
blood
when
i
describe
him
as
something
of
an
outcast
therefore
it
will
be
seen
that
he
was
such
both
voluntarily
and
involuntarily
what
the
world
has
gained
by
brains
is
simply
nothing
to
what
it
has
lost
by
them
a
dream
my
dear
fellow
a
mere
dream
i
stopped
him
yet
with
sympathy
because
i
knew
he
found
relief
this
way
your
constructive
imagination
is
too
active
by
gad
he
replied
warmly
but
there
is
a
place
somewhere
or
a
state
of
mind
the
same
thing
where
it
more
than
a
dream
and
what
more
bless
your
stodgy
old
heart
some
day
i
get
there
not
in
england
at
any
rate
i
suggested
he
stared
at
me
a
moment
his
eyes
suddenly
charged
with
dreams
then
characteristically
he
snorted
he
flung
his
hand
out
with
a
gesture
that
should
push
the
present
further
from
him
i
always
liked
the
eastern
theory
old
theory
anyhow
if
not
eastern
that
intense
yearnings
end
by
creating
a
place
where
they
are
fulfilled
subjectively
of
course
objectively
means
incompletely
i
mean
a
heaven
built
up
by
desire
and
intense
longing
all
your
life
your
own
thought
makes
it
living
idea
that
another
dream
terence
i
laughed
but
beautiful
and
seductive
to
argue
bored
him
he
loved
to
state
his
matter
fill
it
with
detail
blow
the
heated
breath
of
life
into
it
and
then
leave
it
argument
belittled
without
clarifying
criticism
destroyed
sealing
up
the
sources
of
life
any
fool
could
argue
the
small
denying
minds
were
always
critics
a
dream
but
a
damned
foine
one
let
me
tell
you
he
exclaimed
recovering
his
brogue
in
his
enthusiasm
he
glared
at
me
a
second
then
burst
out
laughing
tis
better
to
have
dhreamed
and
waked
he
added
than
never
to
have
dhreamed
at
all
and
then
he
poured
out
passionate
ode
to
the
dreamers
of
the
world
we
are
the
and
we
are
the
dreamers
of
dreams
wandering
by
lone
and
sitting
by
desolate
streams
and
on
whom
the
pale
moon
gleams
yet
we
are
the
movers
and
shakers
of
the
world
forever
it
seems
with
wonderful
deathless
ditties
we
build
up
the
world
great
cities
and
out
of
a
fabulous
story
we
fashion
an
empire
glory
one
man
with
a
dream
at
pleasure
shall
go
forth
and
conquer
a
crown
and
three
with
a
new
song
measure
can
trample
an
empire
down
we
in
the
ages
lying
in
the
buried
past
of
the
earth
built
nineveh
with
our
sighing
and
babel
itself
with
our
mirth
and
them
with
prophesying
to
the
old
of
the
new
world
worth
for
each
age
is
a
dream
that
is
dying
or
one
that
is
coming
to
birth
for
this
passion
for
some
simple
innocence
and
beauty
lay
in
his
soul
like
a
lust
and
voracious
iii
lonely
why
should
i
feel
lonely
is
not
our
planet
in
the
milky
way
thoreau
march
had
passed
shouting
away
and
april
was
whispering
deliciously
among
her
scented
showers
when
went
on
board
the
coasting
steamer
at
marseilles
for
the
levant
and
the
black
sea
the
made
the
land
unbearable
but
herds
of
white
horses
ran
galloping
over
the
bay
beneath
a
sky
of
childhood
blue
the
ship
started
punctually
he
came
on
board
as
usual
with
a
bare
minute
margin
and
from
his
rapid
survey
of
the
thronged
upper
deck
it
seems
he
singled
out
on
the
instant
this
man
and
boy
wondering
first
vaguely
at
their
uncommon
air
of
bulk
secondly
at
the
absence
of
detail
which
should
confirm
it
they
appeared
so
much
bigger
than
they
actually
were
the
laughter
rising
in
his
heart
however
did
not
get
as
far
as
his
lips
for
this
appearance
of
massive
bulk
and
of
shoulders
comely
yet
almost
humped
was
not
borne
out
by
a
direct
inspection
it
was
a
mental
impression
the
man
though
broad
and
with
heavy
back
and
neck
and
uncommonly
sturdy
torso
was
in
no
sense
monstrous
it
was
upon
the
corner
of
the
eye
that
the
bulk
and
hugeness
dawned
a
false
report
that
melted
under
direct
vision
took
him
in
with
attention
merging
in
respect
searching
in
vain
for
the
detail
of
back
and
limbs
and
neck
that
suggested
so
curiously
the
sense
of
the
gigantic
the
boy
beside
him
obviously
son
possessed
the
same
elusive
attributes
felt
yet
never
positively
seen
passing
down
to
his
cabin
wondering
vaguely
to
what
nationality
they
might
belong
he
was
immediately
behind
them
elbowing
french
and
german
tourists
when
the
father
abruptly
turned
and
faced
him
their
gaze
met
started
whew
ran
some
silent
expression
like
fire
through
his
brain
out
of
a
massive
visage
placid
for
all
its
ruggedness
shone
eyes
large
and
timid
as
those
of
an
animal
or
child
bewildered
among
so
many
people
there
was
an
expression
in
them
not
so
much
cowed
or
dismayed
as
the
eyes
of
the
hunted
creature
that
at
least
was
the
first
thing
they
betrayed
for
the
same
second
the
celt
caught
another
look
the
look
of
a
hunted
creature
that
at
last
knows
shelter
and
has
found
it
the
first
expression
had
emerged
then
withdrawn
again
swiftly
like
an
animal
into
its
hole
where
safety
lay
before
disappearing
it
had
flashed
a
wireless
message
of
warning
of
welcome
of
explanation
he
knew
not
what
term
to
use
to
another
of
its
own
kind
to
utterly
arrested
stood
and
stared
he
would
have
spoken
for
the
invitation
seemed
obvious
enough
but
there
came
an
odd
catch
in
his
breath
and
words
failed
altogether
the
boy
peering
at
him
sideways
clung
to
his
great
parent
side
for
perhaps
ten
seconds
there
was
this
interchange
of
staring
intimate
staring
between
the
three
of
them
and
then
the
irishman
confused
more
than
a
little
agitated
ended
the
silent
introduction
with
an
imperceptible
bow
and
passed
on
slowly
knocking
through
the
crowd
down
to
his
cabin
on
the
lower
deck
in
his
heart
deep
down
stirred
an
indescribable
sympathy
with
something
he
divined
in
these
two
that
was
akin
to
himself
but
that
as
yet
he
could
not
name
on
the
surface
he
felt
an
emotion
he
knew
not
whether
to
call
uneasiness
or
surprise
but
crowding
past
it
half
smothering
it
rose
this
other
more
profound
emotion
something
enormously
winning
in
the
atmosphere
of
father
and
son
called
to
him
in
the
silence
it
was
significant
oddly
buried
not
yet
had
it
emerged
enough
to
be
confessed
and
labeled
but
each
had
recognized
it
in
the
other
each
knew
each
waited
and
it
was
extraordinarily
disturbing
before
unpacking
he
sat
for
a
long
time
on
his
berth
thinking
in
vain
to
catch
through
a
thunder
of
surprising
emotions
the
word
that
might
bring
explanation
that
strange
impression
of
giant
bulk
unsupported
by
actual
measurements
that
look
of
startled
security
seeking
shelter
that
other
look
of
being
sure
of
knowing
where
to
go
and
being
actually
all
these
he
felt
grew
from
the
same
hidden
cause
whereof
they
were
symptoms
it
was
this
hidden
thing
in
the
man
that
had
reached
out
invisibly
and
fired
his
own
consciousness
as
their
gaze
met
in
that
brief
instant
and
it
had
disturbed
him
so
profoundly
because
the
very
same
lost
thing
lay
buried
in
himself
the
man
knew
whereas
he
anticipated
merely
as
yet
what
was
it
why
came
there
with
it
both
happiness
and
fear
the
word
that
kept
chasing
itself
in
a
circle
like
a
kitten
after
its
own
tail
yet
bringing
no
explanation
was
loneliness
a
loneliness
that
must
be
whispered
for
it
was
loneliness
on
the
verge
of
finding
relief
and
if
proclaimed
too
loud
there
might
come
those
who
would
interfere
and
prevent
relief
the
man
and
the
boy
too
for
that
matter
were
escaping
they
had
found
the
way
back
were
ready
and
eager
moreover
to
show
it
to
other
prisoners
and
this
was
as
near
as
could
come
to
explanation
he
began
to
understand
dimly
and
with
an
extraordinary
excitement
of
happiness
well
and
the
bigness
i
asked
seizing
on
a
practical
point
after
listening
to
his
dreaming
what
do
you
make
of
that
it
must
have
had
some
definite
cause
surely
he
turned
and
fixed
his
light
blue
eyes
on
mine
as
we
paced
beside
the
serpentine
that
summer
afternoon
when
i
first
heard
the
story
told
he
was
half
grave
half
laughing
the
size
the
bulk
the
bigness
he
replied
must
have
been
in
reality
the
expression
of
some
mental
quality
that
reached
me
psychically
producing
its
effect
directly
on
my
mind
and
not
upon
the
eyes
at
all
in
telling
the
story
he
used
a
simile
omitted
in
the
writing
of
it
because
his
sense
of
humor
perceived
that
no
possible
turn
of
phrase
could
save
it
from
grotesqueness
when
actually
it
was
far
from
grotesque
extraordinarily
pathetic
rather
as
though
he
said
the
great
back
and
shoulders
carried
beneath
the
loose
black
cape
humps
projections
at
least
but
projections
not
ugly
in
themselves
comely
even
in
some
perfectly
natural
way
that
lent
to
his
person
this
idea
of
giant
size
his
body
though
large
was
normal
so
far
as
its
proportions
were
concerned
in
his
spirit
though
there
hid
another
shape
an
aspect
of
that
other
shape
somehow
reached
my
mind
then
seeing
that
i
found
nothing
at
the
moment
to
reply
he
added
as
an
angry
man
you
may
picture
to
yourself
as
red
or
a
jealous
man
as
green
he
laughed
aloud
d
see
now
it
was
not
really
a
physical
business
at
all
iv
we
think
with
only
a
small
part
of
the
past
but
it
is
with
our
entire
past
including
the
original
bent
of
our
soul
that
we
desire
will
and
act
henri
bergson
the
balance
of
his
were
not
distinguished
there
was
a
company
of
french
tourists
gong
to
naples
and
another
lot
of
germans
bound
for
athens
some
business
folk
for
smyrna
and
constantinople
and
a
sprinkling
of
russians
going
home
via

or

in
his
own
stateroom
occupying
the
upper
berth
was
a
little
canadian
drummer
traveling
in
the
name
of
the
machine
its
price
and
the
terms
of
purchase
were
his
universe
he
knew
them
in
several

beyond
them
nothing

was
conceding

turned
over
to

old
traveler
he
added
his
voice
muffled
by
sheets
and
blankets
and
take
things
as
they
come
and
the
only
objection
found
in
him
was
that
he
took
things
as
they
came
to
the
point
of
not
taking
baths
at
all
and
not
even
taking
all
his
garments
off
when
he
went
to
bed
the
captain
whom
he
knew
from
previous
voyages
a
genial
sailor
from
sassnitz
chided
him
for
so
nearly
missing
the
boat
as
usual
you
too
late
for
a
seat
at
my
taple

said
with
his
laughing
growl

a

his

but
you

me
come
up
sometimes
for
a
smoke
with
you
on

asked
after
a
moment

the
jolly
captain
laughed

as
usual
you

zooner

but
anyway

then
i
hope
they

up
there
and
he
was
off
with
his
hearty
deep
laugh
and
rather
ponderous
briskness
toward
the
bridge
thus
found
himself
placed
for
meals
at
the
right
hand
of
stahl
opposite
him
on
the
doctor
left
a
talkative
moscow
who
having
come
to
definite
conclusions
of
his
own
about
things
n
general
was
persuaded
the
rest
of
the
world
must
share
them
and
who
delivered
verbose
commonplaces
with
a
kind
of
pontifical
utterance
sometimes
amusing
but
usually
boring
on
his
right
a
armenian
priest
from
the
venice
monastery
that
had
sheltered
byron
a
man
who
ate
everything
except
soup
with
his
knife
yet
with
a
daintiness
that
made
one
marvel
and
with
hands
so
graceful
they
might
almost
have
replaced
the
knife
without
off
offence
beyond
the
priest
sat
the
rotund
canadian
drummer
he
kept
silence
watched
the
dishes
carefully
lest
anything
should
escape
him
and
ate
lower
down
on
the
opposite
side
one
or
two
nondescripts
between
sat
the
big
blond
bearded
stranger
with
his
son
diagonally
across
from
himself
and
the
doctor
they
were
in
full
view
talked
to
all
and
sundry
whom
his
voice
could
reach
being
easily
forthcoming
to
people
whom
he
was
not
likely
to
see
again
but
he
was
particularly
pleased
to
find
himself
next
to
the
ship
doctor
heinrich
stahl
for
the
man
both
attracted
and
antagonized
him
and
they
had
crossed
swords
pleasantly
on
more
voyages
than
one
there
was
a
fundamental
contradiction
in
his
character
due
divined
to
the
fact
that
his
experiences
did
not
tally
as
he
wished
them
to
do
with
his
beliefs
or
vice
versa
affecting
to
believe
in
nothing
he
occasionally
dropped
remarks
that
betrayed
a
belief
in
all
kinds
of
things
unorthodox
things
then
having
led
the
irishman
into
confessions
of
his
own
fairy
faith
he
would
abruptly
rule
the
whole
subject
out
of
order
with
some
cynical
phrase
that
closed
discussion
in
this
sarcastic
attitude
detected
a
pose
assumed
for
his
own
protection
no
man
of
sense
can
possibly
accept
such
a
thing
it
is
incredible
and
foolish
yet
the
biting
way
he
said
the
words
betrayed
him
the
very
thing
his
reason
rejected
his
soul
believed
these
vivid
impressions
the
irishman
had
of
people
one
wonders
how
accurate
they
were
in
this
case
perhaps
he
was
not
far
from
the
truth
that
a
man
with
stahl
knowledge
and
ability
could
be
content
to
hide
his
light
under
the
bushel
of
a
mere
required
explanation
his
own
explanation
was
that
he
wanted
leisure
for
thinking
and
writing
slovenly
prematurely
old
his
beard
stained
with
tobacco
and
snuff
scientific
in
the
imaginative
sense
that
made
him
speculative
beyond
mere
formulae
his
was
an
individuality
that
inspired
a
respect
one
could
never
quite
account
for
he
had
keen
dark
eyes
that
twinkled
sometimes
mockingly
sometimes
if
the
word
may
be
allowed
bitterly
yet
often
too
with
a
amusement
which
sympathy
with
human
weaknesses
could
alone
have
caused
a
warm
heart
he
certainly
had
as
more
than
one
forlorn
passenger
could
testify
conversation
at
their
table
was
slow
at
first
it
began
at
the
lower
end
where
the
french
tourists
chattered
briskly
over
the
soup
then
crept
upwards
like
a
slow
fire
various
individuals
who
would
not
catch
for
instance
it
passed
the
man
it
passed
the
nondescripts
it
also
passed
the
big
stranger
and
his
son
at
the
table
behind
there
was
a
steady
roar
and
buzz
of
voices
the
captain
was
easy
and
genial
prophesying
to
the
ladies
on
either
side
of
him
a
calm
voyage
in
the
shelter
of
his
big
voice
even
the
shy
found
it
easy
to
make
remarks
to
their
neighbors
listening
to
fragments
of
the
talk
found
that
his
own
eyes
kept
wandering
down
the
table
diagonally
across
to
the
two
strangers
once
or
twice
he
intercepted
the
doctor
glance
traveling
in
the
same
direction
and
on
these
occasions
it
was
on
the
tip
of
his
tongue
to
make
a
remark
about
them
or
to
ask
a
question
yet
the
words
did
not
come
stahl
he
felt
knew
a
similar
hesitation
each
wanting
to
speak
yet
kept
silence
waiting
for
the
other
to
break
the
ice
this
is
tiresome
observed
the
doctor
as
the
tide
of
talk
flowed
up
to
his
end
and
made
a
remark
necessary
it
tries
the
nerves
of
some
he
glanced
at
but
it
was
the
who
replied
spreading
a
hand
over
his
plate
to
feel
the
warmth
i
know
it
well
he
said
pompously
in
a
tone
of
finality
it
lasts
three
six
or
nine
days
but
once
across
the
golfe
de
lyons
we
shall
be
free
of
it
you
think
so
ah
i
am
glad
ventured
the
priest
with
a
timid
smile
while
he
adroitly
balanced
meat
and
green
peas
upon
his
tone
smile
and
gesture
were
so
gentle
that
the
use
of
steel
in
any
form
seemed
incongruous
the
voice
of
the
came
in
domineeringly
of
course
i
have
made
this
trip
so
often
i
petersburg
to
paris
a
few
weeks
on
the
riviera
then
back
by
constantinople
and
the
crimea
it
is
nothing
i
remember
last
year
he
pushed
a
large
pearl
pin
more
deeply
into
his
speckled
tie
and
began
a
story
that
proved
chiefly
how
luxuriously
he
traveled
his
eyes
tried
to
draw
the
whole
end
of
the
table
into
his
circle
but
while
the
armenian
listened
politely
with
smiles
and
bows
stahl
turned
to
the
irishman
again
it
vas
the
year
of
halley
comet
and
he
began
talking
interestingly
about
it
three
in
the
morning
any
morning
yes
is
the
best
time
the
doctor
concluded
and
i
have
you
called
you
must
see
it
through
my
telescope
end
of
this
week
say
after
we
leave
catania
and
turn
eastwards
and
at
this
instant
following
a
roar
of
laughter
from
the
table
came
one
of
those
abrupt
pauses
that
sometimes
catch
an
entire
room
at
once
all
voices
hushed
even
the
merchant
setting
down
his
champagne
glass
fell
silent
one
heard
only
the
beating
of
the
screw
the
rush
of
water
below
the
the
soft
scuffle
of
the
stewards
feet
the
conclusion
of
the
doctor
inconsiderable
sentence
was
sharply
audible
all
over
the
room
crossing
the
ionian
sea
toward
the
isles
of
greece
it
rang
across
the
pause
and
at
the
same
moment
caught
the
eyes
of
the
big
stranger
lifted
suddenly
and
fixed
upon
the
speaker
face
as
though
the
words
had
summoned
him
they
shifted
the
same
instant
to
his
own
then
dropped
again
to
his
plate
again
the
clatter
of
conversation
drowned
the
room
as
before
the
merchant
resumed
his
in
terms
of
gold
the
doctor
discussed
the
gases
of
the
comet
tail
but
the
irishman
felt
himself
caught
away
strangely
and
suddenly
into
another
world
out
of
the
abyss
of
the
subconscious
there
rose
a
gesture
prophetic
and
immense
the
trivial
phrase
and
that
intercepted
look
opened
a
great
door
of
wonder
in
his
heart
in
a
second
he
grew
or
rather
something
touched
a
button
and
the
whole
machinery
of
his
personality
shifted
round
noiselessly
and
instantaneously
presenting
an
immediate
new
facet
to
the
world
his
normal
puny
slipped
a
moment
into
the
majestic
calm
of
some
far
larger
state
that
the
stranger
also
knew
the
universe
lies
in
every
human
heart
and
he
plunged
into
that
archetypal
world
that
stands
so
close
behind
all
sensible
appearances
he
could
neither
explain
nor
attempt
to
explain
but
he
sailed
away
into
some
giant
swimming
mood
of
beauty
wherein
steamer
passengers
talk
faded
utterly
the
stranger
and
his
son
remaining
alone
real
and
vital
he
had
seen
he
could
never
forget
chance
prepared
the
setting
but
immense
powers
had
rushed
in
and
availed
themselves
of
it
something
deeply
buried
had
flamed
from
the
eyes
and
beckoned
to
him
the
fire
ran
from
the
big
man
to
himself
and
was
gone
the
isles
of
greece
the
words
were
simple
enough
yet
it
seemed
to
that
the
look
they
summoned
to
the
stranger
eyes
ensouled
them
transfiguring
them
with
the
significance
of
vital
clues
they
touched
the
fringe
of
a
mystery
magnificent
and
remote
some
transcendent
psychical
drama
in
the
of
this
man
whose
bigness
and
whose
loneliness
that
must
be
whispered
were
also
in
their
way
other
vital
clues
moreover
remembering
his
first
sight
of
these
two
upon
the
upper
deck
a
few
hours
before
he
understood
that
his
own
spirit
by
virtue
of
its
peculiar
and
primitive
yearnings
was
involved
in
the
same
mystery
and
included
in
the
same
hidden
passion
the
little
incident
illustrates
admirably
idiosyncrasy
of
seeing
whole
in
a
lightning
flash
his
inner
sense
had
associated
the
words
and
the
glance
divining
that
the
one
had
caused
the
other
that
pause
provided
the
opportunity
if
imagination
then
it
was
creative
imagination
if
true
it
was
assuredly
spiritual
insight
of
a
rare
quality
he
became
aware
that
the
twinkling
eyes
of
his
neighbor
were
observing
him
keenly
for
some
moments
evidently
he
had
been
staring
down
the
table
he
turned
quickly
and
looked
at
the
doctor
with
frankness
this
time
it
was
impossible
to
avoid
speech
of
some
kind
following
those
lights
that
do
mislead
the
morn
asked
stahl
slyly
your
thoughts
have
been
traveling
you
heard
none
of
my
last
remarks
under
the
clamor
of
the
merchant
voice
replied
in
a
lowered
tone
i
was
watching
those
two
down
the
table
opposite
they
interest
you
as
well
i
see
it
was
not
a
challenge
exactly
if
the
tone
was
aggressive
it
was
merely
that
he
felt
the
subject
was
one
on
which
they
would
differ
and
he
scented
an
approaching
discussion
the
reply
indicating
agreement
surprised
him
a
good
deal
they
do
they
interest
me
greatly
there
was
no
trace
of
fight
in
the
voice
that
should
cause
no
surprise
me
they
simply
fascinate
said
always
easily
drawn
what
is
it
what
do
you
see
about
them
that
is
unusual
do
you
too
see
them
the
doctor
did
not
answer
at
once
and
added
the
father
a
tremendous
fellow
but
it
not
that
partly
though
said
the
other
partly
i
think
what
else
then
the
still
talking
prevented
their
being
overheard
what
is
it
marks
them
off
so
from
the
rest
of
all
people
should
see
smiled
the
doctor
quietly
if
a
man
of
your
imagination
sees
nothing
what
shall
a
poor
exact
mind
like
myself
see
he
eyed
him
keenly
a
moment
you
really
mean
that
you
detect
nothing
a
certain
distinction
yes
a
certain
aloofness
from
others
isolated
they
seem
in
a
way
rather
a
splendid
isolation
i
should
call
it
and
then
he
stopped
abruptly
it
was
most
curious
but
he
was
aware
that
unwittingly
in
this
way
he
had
stumbled
upon
the
truth
aware
at
the
same
time
that
he
resented
discussing
it
with
his
companion
because
it
meant
at
the
same
time
discussing
himself
or
something
in
himself
he
wished
to
hide
his
entire
mood
shifted
again
with
completeness
and
rapidity
he
could
not
help
it
it
seemed
suddenly
as
though
he
had
been
telling
the
doctor
secrets
about
himself
secrets
moreover
he
would
not
treat
sympathetically
the
doctor
had
been
at
him
so
to
speak
searching
the
depths
of
him
with
a
probing
acuteness
the
casual
language
had
disguised
what
are
they
do
you
suppose
finns
russians
norwegians
or
what
the
doctor
asked
and
the
other
replied
briefly
that
he
guessed
they
might
be
russians
perhaps
south
russians
his
tone
was
different
he
wished
to
avoid
further
discussion
at
the
first
opportunity
he
neatly
changed
the
conversation
it
was
curious
the
way
proof
came
to
him
something
in
himself
wild
as
the
desert
something
to
do
with
that
love
of
primitive
life
he
discussed
only
with
the
few
who
were
intimately
sympathetic
toward
it
this
something
in
his
soul
was
so
akin
to
a
similar
passion
in
these
strangers
that
to
talk
of
it
was
to
betray
himself
as
well
as
them
further
he
resented
stahl
interest
in
them
because
he
felt
it
was
critical
and
scientific
not
far
behind
hid
the
analysis
that
would
lay
them
bare
leading
to
their
destruction
a
profound
instinctive
sense
of
had
been
stirred
within
him
already
mysteriously
guided
by
secret
affinities
he
had
ranged
himself
on
the
side
of
the
strangers

novalis
pollen
translated
by
in
this
way
there
came
between
these
two
the
slight
barrier
of
a
forbidden
subject
that
grew
because
neither
destroyed
it
had
erected
it
stahl
respected
it
neither
referred
again
for
a
time
to
the
big
russian
and
his
son
in
his
written
account
who
was
certainly
no
constructive
literary
craftsman
left
out
apparently
countless
little
confirmatory
details
by
word
of
mouth
he
made
me
feel
at
once
that
this
mystery
existed
however
and
to
weld
the
two
together
is
a
difficult
task
there
nevertheless
was
this
something
about
the
russian
and
his
boy
that
excited
deep
curiosity
accompanied
by
an
aversion
on
the
part
of
the
other
passengers
that
isolated
them
also
there
was
this
competition
on
the
part
of
the
two
friends
to
solve
it
from
opposing
motives
had
either
of
the
strangers
fallen
seasick
the
advantage
would
have
been
easily
with
stahl
professionally
but
since
they
remained
well
and
the
doctor
was
in
constant
demand
by
the
other
passengers
it
was
the
irishman
who
won
the
first
move
and
came
to
close
quarters
by
making
a
personal
acquaintance
his
strong
desire
helped
matters
of
course
for
he
noticed
with
indignation
that
these
two
quiet
and
inoffensive
as
they
were
and
with
no
salient
cause
of
offence
were
yet
rejected
by
the
main
body
of
passengers
they
seemed
to
possess
a
quality
that
somehow
insulated
them
from
approach
sending
them
effectually
to
coventry
and
in
a
small
steamer
where
the
travelers
settle
down
into
a
kind
of
big
family
life
this
isolation
was
unpleasantly
noticeable
it
stood
out
in
numerous
little
details
that
only
a
keen
observer
closely
watching
could
have
taken
into
account
small
advances
courtesies
and
the
like
that
ordinarily
should
have
led
to
conversation
in
their
case
led
to
nothing
the
other
passengers
invariably
moved
away
after
a
few
moments
politely
excusing
themselves
as
it
were
from
further
intercourse
and
although
at
first
the
sight
of
this
stirred
in
him
an
instinct
of
revolt
that
was
almost
anger
he
soon
felt
that
the
couple
not
merely
failed
to
invite
but
even
emanated
some
definite
atmosphere
that
repelled
and
each
time
he
witnessed
these
little
scenes
there
grew
more
strongly
in
him
the
original
picture
he
had
formed
of
them
as
beings
rejected
and
alone
hunted
by
humanity
as
a
whole
seeking
escape
from
loneliness
into
a
place
of
refuge
that
they
knew
of
definitely
at
last
only
an
imaginative
mind
thus
concentrated
upon
them
could
have
divined
all
this
yet
to
it
seemed
plain
as
the
day
with
the
certitude
moreover
came
the
feeling
ever
stronger
that
the
refuge
they
sought
would
prove
to
be
also
the
refuge
he
himself
sought
the
difference
being
that
whereas
they
knew
he
still
hesitated
yet
in
spite
of
this
secret
sympathy
imagined
or
discovered
he
found
it
no
easy
matter
to
approach
the
big
man
for
speech
for
a
day
and
a
half
he
merely
watched
attraction
so
strong
excited
caution
he
paused
waiting
his
attention
however
was
so
keen
that
he
seemed
always
to
know
where
they
were
and
what
they
were
doing
by
instinct
he
was
aware
in
what
part
of
the
ship
they
would
be
found
for
the
most
part
leaning
over
the
rail
alone
in
the
bows
staring
down
at
the
churned
water
together
by
the
screws
pacing
the
in
the
dusk
or
early
morning
when
no
one
was
about
or
hidden
away
in
some
corner
of
the
upper
deck
side
by
side
gazing
at
sea
and
sky
their
method
of
walking
too
made
it
easy
to
single
them
out
from
the
rest
a
free
swaying
movement
of
the
limbs
a
swing
of
the
shoulders
a
gait
that
was
lumbering
almost
clumsy
half
defiant
yet
at
the
same
time
graceful
and
curiously
rapid
the
body
moved
along
swiftly
for
all
its
air
of
blundering
a
motion
which
was
a
counterpart
of
that
elusive
appearance
of
great
bulk
and
equally
difficult
of
exact
determination
an
air
went
with
them
of
being
ridiculously
confined
by
the
narrow
little
decks
thus
it
was
that
genoa
had
been
made
and
the
ship
was
already
half
way
on
to
naples
before
the
opportunity
for
closer
acquaintance
presented
itself
rather
unable
longer
to
resist
forced
it
it
seemed
too
inevitable
as
sunrise
rain
had
followed
the
and
the
sea
was
rough
a
rich
came
about
the
ship
like
the
smell
of
wet
oaks
when
wind
sweeps
their
leaves
after
a
sousing
shower
in
the
hour
before
dinner
the
decks
slippery
with
moisture
only
one
or
two
passengers
in
below
the
awning
following
a
sure
inner
lead
came
out
of
the
stuffy
into
the
air
it
was
already
dark
and
the
drive
of
rain
somewhat
obscured
his
vision
after
the
glare
only
for
a
moment
though
for
almost
the
first
thing
he
saw
was
the
russian
and
his
boy
moving
in
front
of
him
toward
the
aft
compasses
like
a
single
figure
huge
and
shadowy
they
passed
into
the
darkness
beyond
with
a
speed
that
seemed
as
usual
out
of
proportion
to
their
actual
stride
they
lumbered
rapidly
away
caught
that
final
swing
of
the
man
great
shoulders
as
they
disappeared
and
leaving
the
covered
deck
he
made
straight
after
them
and
though
neither
gave
any
sign
that
they
had
seen
him
he
felt
that
they
were
aware
of
his
coming
and
even
invited
him
as
he
drew
close
a
roll
of
the
vessel
brought
them
almost
into
each
other
arms
and
the
boy
half
hidden
beneath
his
parent
flowing
cloak
looked
up
at
once
and
smiled
the
saloon
light
fell
dimly
upon
his
face
the
irishman
saw
that
friendly
smile
of
welcome
and
lurched
forward
with
the
roll
of
the
deck
they
brought
up
against
the
bulwarks
and
the
big
man
put
out
an
arm
to
steady
him
they
all
three
laughed
together
at
close
quarters
as
usual
again
the
impression
of
bulk
had
disappeared
and
then
at
first
utterly
unlike
real
life
they
said
nothing
the
boy
moved
round
and
stood
close
to
his
side
so
that
he
found
himself
placed
between
them
all
three
leaning
forward
over
the
rails
watching
the
phosphorescence
of
the
mediterranean
dusk
lay
over
the
sea
the
shores
of
italy
not
near
enough
to
be
visible
the
mist
the
hour
the
loneliness
of
the
deserted
decks
and
something
else
that
was
nameless
shut
them
in
these
three
in
a
little
world
of
their
own
a
sentence
or
two
rose
in
mind
but
without
finding
utterance
for
he
felt
that
no
spoken
words
were
necessary
he
was
accepted
without
more
ado
a
deep
natural
sympathy
existed
between
them
recognized
intuitively
from
that
moment
of
first
mutual
inspection
at
marseilles
it
was
instinctive
almost
as
with
animals
the
action
of
the
boy
in
coming
round
to
his
side
unhindered
by
the
father
was
the
symbol
of
utter
confidence
and
welcome
there
came
then
one
of
those
splendid
and
significant
moments
that
occasionally
for
some
burst
into
life
flooding
all
barriers
breaking
down
as
with
a
flaming
light
the
thousand
erections
of
shadow
that
close
one
in
something
imprisoned
in
himself
swept
outwards
rising
like
a
wave
bringing
an
expansion
of
life
that
explained
it
vanished
of
course
instantly
again
but
not
before
he
had
caught
a
flying
remnant
that
lit
the
broken
puzzles
of
his
heart
and
left
things
clearer
before
thought
and
therefore
words
could
overtake
it
was
gone
but
there
remained
at
least
this
glimpse
the
fire
had
flashed
a
light
down
subterranean
passages
of
his
being
and
made
visible
for
a
passing
second
some
clue
to
his
buried
primitive
yearnings
he
partly
understood
standing
there
between
these
two
this
thing
came
over
him
with
a
degree
of
intelligibility
scarcely
captured
by
his
words
the
qualities
his
quietness
peace
slowness
silence
betrayed
somehow
that
his
inner
life
dwelt
in
a
region
vast
and
simple
shaping
even
his
exterior
presentment
with
its
own
huge
characteristics
a
region
wherein
the
distress
of
the
modern
world
vulgar
futile
strife
could
not
exist
more
could
never
existed
the
irishman
who
had
never
realized
exactly
why
the
life
of
today
to
him
was
dreadful
now
understood
it
in
the
presence
of
this
simple
being
with
his
atmosphere
of
stately
power
he
was
like
a
child
but
a
child
of
some
utterly
primitive
and
utterly
forgotten
of
no
particular
age
but
of
some
state
that
antedates
all
ages
simple
in
some
noble
concentrated
sense
that
was
prodigious
almost
terrific
to
stand
thus
beside
him
was
to
stand
beside
a
mighty
silent
fire
steadily
glowing
a
fire
that
fed
all
lesser
flames
because
itself
close
to
the
central
source
of
fire
he
felt
warmed
lighted
vivified
made
whole
the
presence
of
this
stranger
took
him
at
a
single
gulp
as
it
were
straight
into
nature
a
nature
that
was
alive
the
man
was
part
of
her
never
before
had
he
stood
so
close
and
intimate
cities
and
civilization
fled
away
like
transient
dreams
ashamed
the
sun
and
moon
and
stars
moved
up
and
touched
him
this
word
of
lightning
explanation
at
least
came
to
him
as
he
breathed
the
other
atmosphere
and
presence
the
region
where
this
man
spirit
fed
was
at
the
center
whereas
today
men
were
active
with
a
scattered
superficial
cleverness
at
the
periphery
he
even
understood
that
his
giant
gait
and
movements
were
small
outer
evidences
of
this
inner
fact
wholly
in
keeping
that
blundering
stupidity
half
glorious
half
pathetic
with
which
he
moved
among
his
fellows
was
a
physical
expression
of
this
psychic
fact
that
his
spirit
had
never
learned
the
skilful
tricks
taught
by
civilization
to
lesser
men
it
was
in
a
way
for
he
was
now
at
last
driving
back
full
speed
for
his
own
region
and
escape
knew
himself
caught
swept
off
his
feet
momentarily
driving
with
him
the
singular
deep
satisfaction
of
it
standing
there
with
these
two
in
the
first
moment
he
describes
as
an
entirely
new
sensation
in
his
life
an
awareness
that
he
was
complete
the
boy
touched
his
side
and
he
let
an
arm
steal
round
to
shelter
him
the
huge
bearded
parent
rose
in
his
massiveness
against
his
other
shoulder
hemming
him
in
for
a
second
he
knew
a
swift
and
curious
alarm
passing
however
almost
at
once
into
the
thrill
of
a
rare
happiness
in
that
moment
it
was
not
the
passengers
or
the
temper
of
today
who
rejected
them
it
was
they
who
rejected
the
world
because
they
knew
another
and
superior
one
more
they
were
in
it
then
without
turning
the
big
man
spoke
the
words
in
heavy
accented
english
coming
out
laboriously
and
with
slow
exceeding
difficulty
as
though
utterance
was
a
supreme
effort
you
come
with
us
it
was
like
stammering
almost
still
more
was
it
like
essential
inarticulateness
struggling
into
an
utterance
foreign
to
it
unsuited
the
voice
was
a
deep
and
windy
bass
merging
with
the
noise
of
the
sea
below
i
going
to
the
caucasus
replied
up
into
the
old
old
mountains
to
see
things
to
look
about
to
search
he
really
wanted
to
say
much
more
but
the
words
lay
dead
or
beyond
reach
the
big
man
nodded
slowly
the
boy
listened
and
yourself
asked
the
irishman
hardly
knowing
why
he
faltered
and
trembled
the
other
smiled
a
beauty
that
was
beyond
all
language
passed
with
that
smile
across
the
great
face
in
the
dusk
some
of
us
of
ours
he
spoke
very
slowly
very
brokenly
quarrying
out
the
words
with
real
labor
still
survive
out
there
we
now
go
back
so
very
few
remain
and
you
come
with
us

look
here
old
man
he
said
to
me
i
just
tell
you
what
it
was
because
i
know
you
wo
laugh
we
were
lying
under
the
big
trees
behind
the
round
pond
when
he
reached
this
point
and
his
direct
speech
was
so
much
more
graphic
than
the
written
account
that
i
use
it
he
was
in
one
of
his
rare
moments
of
confidence
excited
hat
off
his
shabby
tie
escaping
from
the
shabbier
grey
waistcoat
one
sock
lay
untidily
over
his
boot
showing
bare
leg
children
voices
floated
to
us
from
the
waterside
as
though
from
very
far
away
the
nursemaids
and
perambulators
seemed
tinged
with
unreality
the
london
towers
were
clouds
its
roar
the
roar
of
waves
i
saw
only
the
ship
deck
the
grey
and
misty
sea
the
uncouth
figures
of
the
two
who
leaned
with
him
over
the
bulwarks
go
on
i
said
encouragingly
out
with
it
it
must
seem
incredible
to
most
men
but
by
gad
i
swear
to
you
it
lifted
me
off
my
feet
and
i
never
known
anything
like
it
the
mind
of
that
great
fellow
got
hold
of
me
included
me
he
made
the
inanimate
world
sea
stars
wind
woods
and
mountains
seem
all
alive
the
entire
blessed
universe
was
conscious
and
he
came
straight
out
of
it
to
get
me
i
understood
things
about
myself
i
never
understood
before
and
always
funked
rather
especially
that
feeling
of
being
out
of
touch
with
my
kind
of
finding
no
one
in
the
world
today
who
speaks
my
language
quite
that
and
the
utter
loneliness
it
makes
me
suffer
you
always
have
been
a
lonely
beggar
really
i
said
noting
the
hesitation
that
thus
on
the
very
threshold
checked
his
enthusiasm
quenching
the
fire
in
those
eyes
tell
me
i
shall
understand
right
enough
or
try
to
god
bless
you
he
answered
leaping
to
the
sympathy
i
believe
you
will
there
always
been
this
primitive
savage
thing
in
me
that
keeps
others
away
puts
them
off
and
so
on
i
tried
to
smother
it
a
bit
sometimes
have
you
i
laughed
to
i
said
because
i
always
been
afraid
of
its
getting
out
too
much
and
bustin
my
life
all
to
pieces
something
lonely
and
untamed
and
sort
of
outcast
from
cities
and
money
and
all
the
thick
suffocating
civilization
of
today
and
i
only
saved
myself
by
getting
off
into
wildernesses
and
free
places
where
i
could
give
it
a
breathin
chance
without
running
the
risk
of
being
locked
up
as
a
crazy
man
he
laughed
as
he
said
it
but
his
heart
was
in
the
words
you
know
all
that
have
i
told
you
often
enough
it
not
a
morbid
egoism
or
what
their
precious
academic
books
so
stupidly
call
for
in
me
damned
vital
and
terrific
and
moves
always
to
action
it
made
me
an
alien
and
and
something
far
stronger
than
the
call
of
the
wild
is
it
he
fairly
snorted
sure
as
we
both
alive
here
sittin
on
this
sooty
london
grass
he
cried
this
call
of
the
wild
they
prate
about
is
just
the
call
a
fellow
hears
to
go
on
bust
when
he
had
too
much
town
and
got
bored
a
call
to
a
little
bit
of
license
and
excess
to
him
down
what
i
feel
his
voice
turned
grave
and
quiet
again
is
quite
a
different
affair
it
the
call
of
real
hunger
the
call
of
food
they
want
to
let
off
steam
but
i
want
to
take
in
stuff
to
prevent
starvation
he
whispered
the
word
putting
his
lips
close
to
my
face
a
pause
fell
between
us
which
i
was
the
first
to
break
this
is
not
your
century
that
what
you
really
mean
i
suggested
patiently
not
my
century
he
caught
me
up
flinging
handfuls
of
faded
grass
in
the
air
between
us
and
watching
it
fall
why
it
not
even
my
world
and
i
loathe
loathe
the
spirit
of
today
with
its
inventions
and
smother
of
sham
universal
culture
its
murderous
superfluities
and
sordid
vulgarity
without
enough
real
sense
of
beauty
left
to
see
that
a
daisy
is
nearer
heaven
than
an
airship
especially
when
the
airship
falls
i
laughed
steady
steady
old
boy
do
spoil
your
righteous
case
by
overstatement
well
well
you
know
what
i
mean
he
laughed
with
me
though
his
face
at
once
turned
earnest
again
and
all
that
and
all
that
and
all
that
and
so
this
savagery
that
has
burned
in
me
all
these
years
unexplained
these
russian
strangers
made
clear
i
ca
tell
you
how
because
i
do
know
myself
the
father
did
it
his
proximity
his
silence
stuffed
with
sympathy
his
great
vital
personality
unclipped
by
contact
with
these
little
folk
who
left
him
alone
his
presence
alone
made
me
long
for
the
earth
and
nature
he
seemed
a
living
part
of
it
all
he
was
magnificent
and
enormous
but
the
devil
take
me
if
i
know
how
he
said
nothing
that
referred
to
it
directly
nothing
but
what
i
told
you
blundering
awkwardly
with
those
few
modern
words
but
he
had
it
in
him
a
thousand
to
my
one
he
made
me
feel
i
was
right
and
natural
untrue
to
myself
to
suppress
it
and
a
coward
to
fear
it
the
in
the
brain
you
know
is
anyhow
a
comparatively
recent
thing
in
evolution
they
say
that
it
was
his
century
either
i
checked
him
again
no
and
he
did
pretend
it
was
as
i
tried
to
he
cried
sitting
bolt
upright
beside
me
the
fellow
was
genuine
never
dreamed
of
compromise
d
see
what
i
mean
only
somehow
he
found
out
where
his
world
and
century
were
and
was
off
to
take
possession
and
that
what
caught
me
i
felt
it
by
some
instinct
in
me
stronger
than
all
else
only
we
could
talk
about
it
definitely
because
because
i
hardly
know
how
to
put
it
for
the
same
reason
he
added
suddenly
that
i
ca
talk
about
it
to
you
there
are
no
words
what
we
both
sought
was
a
state
that
passed
away
before
words
came
into
use
and
is
therefore
beyond
intelligible
description
no
one
spoke
to
them
on
the
ship
for
the
same
reason
i
felt
sure
that
no
one
spoke
to
them
in
the
whole
world
because
no
one
could
manage
even
the
alphabet
of
their
language
and
this
was
so
strange
and
beautiful
he
went
on
that
standing
there
beside
him
in
his
splendid
atmosphere
the
currents
of
wind
and
sea
reached
through
him
filtered
by
his
spirit
so
that
i
assimilated
them
and
they
fed
me
because
he
somehow
stood
in
such
close
and
direct
relation
to
nature
i
slipped
into
my
own
region
made
happy
and
alive
knowing
at
last
what
i
wanted
though
still
unable
to
phrase
it
this
modern
world
i
so
long
tried
to
adjust
myself
to
became
a
thing
of
pale
remembrance
and
a
dream
all
in
your
mind
and
imagination
of
course
this
i
ventured
seeing
that
his
poetry
was
luring
him
beyond
where
i
could
follow
of
course
he
answered
without
impatience
grown
suddenly
thoughtful
less
excited
again
and
that
why
it
was
true
no
chance
of
clumsy
senses
deceiving
one
it
was
direct
vision
what
is
reality
in
the
last
resort
he
asked
but
the
thing
a
man
vision
brings
to
him
to
believe
there
no
other
criterion
the
criticism
of
opposite
types
of
mind
is
merely
a
confession
of
their
own
limitations
being
myself
of
the
opposite
type
of
mind
i
naturally
did
not
argue
but
suffered
myself
to
accept
his
for
the
whole
temporarily
i
checked
him
from
time
to
time
merely
lest
he
should
go
too
fast
for
me
to
follow
what
seemed
a
very
wonderful
tale
of
faerie
so
this
wild
thing
in
me
the
world
today
has
beggared
and
denied
he
went
on
swept
by
his
celtic
enthusiasm
woke
in
its
full
strength
calling
to
me
like
some
flying
spirit
in
a
storm
it
claimed
me
the
man
being
summoned
me
back
to
the
earth
and
nature
as
it
were
automatically
i
understood
that
look
on
his
face
that
sign
in
his
eyes
the
of
greece
furnished
some
faint
clue
but
as
yet
i
knew
no
more
only
that
he
and
i
were
in
the
same
region
and
that
i
meant
to
go
with
him
and
that
he
accepted
me
with
delight
that
was
joy
it
drew
me
as
empty
space
draws
a
giddy
man
to
the
precipice
edge
thoughts
from
another
mind
he
added
by
way
of
explanation
turning
round
come
far
more
completely
to
me
when
i
stand
in
a
man
atmosphere
silent
and
receptive
than
when
by
speech
he
tries
to
place
them
there
ah
and
that
helps
me
to
get
at
what
i
mean
perhaps
the
man
you
see
hardly
thought
he
as
an
animal
you
mean
instinctively
in
a
sense
yes
he
replied
after
a
momentary
hesitation
like
some
very
early
very
primitive
form
of
life
with
the
best
will
in
the
world
terence
i
do
quite
follow
you
i
do
quite
follow
myself
he
cried
because
i
trying
to
lead
and
follow
at
the
same
time
you
know
that
idea
i
came
across
it
somewhere
that
in
ancient
peoples
the
senses
were
much
less
specialized
than
they
are
now
that
perception
came
to
them
in
general
massive
sensations
rather
than
divided
up
neatly
into
five
channels
that
they
felt
all
over
so
to
speak
and
that
all
the
senses
as
in
an
overdose
of
hashish
become
one
single
sense
the
centralizing
of
perception
in
the
brain
is
a
recent
thing
and
it
might
equally
well
have
occurred
in
any
other
nervous
headquarters
of
the
body
say
the
solar
plexus
or
perhaps
never
have
been
localized
at
all
in
hysteria
patients
have
been
known
to
read
with
the
and
smell
with
the
heel
touch
is
still
all
over
it
only
the
other
four
that
have
got
fixed
in
definite
organs
there
are
systems
of
thought
today
that
still
would
make
the
solar
plexus
the
main
center
and
not
the
brain
the
word
you
know
never
once
occurs
in
the
ancient
scriptures
of
the
world
you
will
not
find
it
in
the
bible
the
reins
the
heart
and
so
forth
were
what
men
felt
with
then
they
felt
all
over
well
he
concluded
abruptly
i
think
this
fellow
was
like
that
d
see
now
i
stared
at
him
greatly
wondering
a
nursemaid
passed
close
balancing
a
child
in
a
saying
in
a
foolish
voice
wupsey
up
wupsey
down
wupsey
there
in
the
full
stream
of
his
mood
waited
impatiently
till
she
had
gone
by
then
rolling
over
on
his
side
he
came
closer
talking
in
a
lowered
tone
i
think
i
never
saw
him
so
deeply
stirred
nor
understood
perhaps
so
little
of
the
extreme
passion
working
in
him
yet
it
was
incredible
that
he
could
have
caught
so
much
from
mere
interviews
with
a
stranger
unless
what
he
said
was
strictly
true
and
this
russian
had
positively
touched
latent
fires
in
his
soul
by
a
kind
of
sympathetic
magic
you
know
he
went
on
almost
under
his
breath
every
man
who
thinks
for
himself
and
feels
vividly
finds
he
lives
in
a
world
of
his
own
apart
and
believes
that
one
day
he
come
across
either
in
a
book
or
in
a
person
the
priest
who
shall
make
it
clear
to
him
well
i
found
mine
that
all
i
ca
prove
it
to
you
with
a
pair
of
scales
or
a
but
it
true
and
you
mean
his
mere
presence
conveyed
all
this
without
speech
almost
because
there
no
speech
possible
he
replied
dropping
his
voice
to
a
whisper
and
thrusting
his
face
yet
closer
into
mine
we
were
solitary
survivors
of
a
world
whose
language
was
either
uncreated
or
he
italicized
the
word
an
elaborate
and
detailed
then
why
not
he
murmured
it
one
of
the
commonest
facts
of
daily
life
and
you
had
never
fully
realized
it
before
this
loneliness
and
its
possible
explanation
that
there
might
exist
i
mean
a
way
of
satisfying
it
till
you
met
this
stranger
he
answered
with
deep
earnestness
always
old
man
always
but
suffered
under
it
atrociously
because
i
never
understood
it
i
had
been
afraid
to
face
it
this
man
a
far
bigger
and
less
diluted
example
of
it
than
myself
made
it
all
clear
and
right
and
natural
we
belonged
to
the
same
forgotten
place
and
time
under
his
lead
and
guidance
i
could
find
my
own
return
i
whistled
a
long
soft
whistle
looking
up
into
the
sky
then
sitting
upright
like
himself
we
stared
hard
at
one
another
straight
in
the
eye
he
was
too
grave
too
serious
to
trifle
with
it
would
have
been
unfair
too
besides
i
loved
to
hear
him
the
way
he
reared
such
fabulous
superstructures
upon
slight
incidents
interpreting
thus
his
complex
being
to
himself
was
uncommonly
interesting
it
was
observing
the
creative
imagination
actually
at
work
and
the
process
in
a
sense
seemed
sacred
only
the
truth
and
actuality
with
which
he
clothed
it
all
made
me
a
little
uncomfortable
sometimes
i
put
it
to
you
quite
simply
he
cried
suddenly
yes
and
simply
it
was
that
he
knew
the
awful
spiritual
loneliness
of
living
in
a
world
whose
tastes
and
interests
were
not
his
own
a
world
to
which
he
was
essentially
foreign
and
at
whose
hands
he
suffered
continual
rebuff
and
rejection
advances
from
either
side
were
mutually
and
necessarily
repelled
because
oil
and
water
can
not
mix
rejected
moreover
not
merely
by
a
family
tribe
or
nation
but
by
a
race
and
time
by
the
whole
world
of
today
an
outcast
and
an
alien
a
desolate
survival
an
appalling
picture
i
understood
it
he
went
on
holding
up
both
hands
by
way
of
emphasis
because
in
miniature
i
had
suffered
the
same
he
was
a
supreme
case
of
what
lay
so
deeply
in
myself
he
was
a
survival
of
other
life
the
modern
mind
has
long
since
agreed
to
exile
and
deny
humanity
stared
at
him
over
a
barrier
never
dreaming
of
asking
him
in
even
had
it
done
so
he
could
not
by
the
law
of
his
being
have
accepted
outcast
myself
in
some
small
way
i
understood
his
terrible
loneliness
a
soul
without
a
country
visible
and
external
country
that
is
a
passion
of
tenderness
and
sympathy
for
him
and
so
also
for
myself
awoke
i
saw
him
as
chieftain
of
all
the
lonely
exiled
souls
of
life
breathless
a
moment
he
lay
on
his
back
staring
at
the
summer
clouds
those
thoughts
of
wind
that
change
and
pass
before
their
meanings
can
be
quite
seized
similarly
protean
was
the
thought
his
phrases
tried
to
clothe
the
terror
pathos
sadness
of
this
big
idea
he
strove
to
express
touched
me
deeply
yet
never
quite
with
the
clarity
of
his
own
conviction
there
such
souls
and
in
exile
he
said
suddenly
again
turning
over
on
the
grass
they
exist
they
walk
the
earth
today
here
and
there
in
the
bodies
of
ordinary
men
and
their
loneliness
is
a
loneliness
that
must
be
whispered
you
formed
any
idea
what
kind
of
of
survival
i
asked
gently
for
the
notion
grew
in
me
that
after
all
these
two
would
prove
to
be
mere
revolutionaries
in
escape
political
refugees
or
something
quite
ordinary
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
for
a
moment
without
replying
presently
he
looked
up
i
remember
that
a
streak
of
london
black
ran
from
the
corner
of
his
mouth
across
the
cheek
he
pushed
the
hair
back
from
his
forehead
answering
in
a
manner
grown
abruptly
calm
and
dispassionate
do
ye
see
what
a
foolish
question
that
is
he
said
quietly
and
how
impossible
to
satisfy
inviting
that
leap
of
invention
which
can
be
only
an
imaginative
lie
i
can
only
tell
you
and
the
breeze
brought
to
us
the
voices
of
children
from
the
round
pond
where
they
sailed
their
ships
of
equally
wonderful
adventure
that
my
own
longing
became
this
to
go
with
him
to
know
what
he
knew
to
live
where
he
lived
forever
and
the
alarm
you
said
you
felt
he
hesitated
that
he
added
was
a
kind
of
mistake
to
go
involved
i
felt
an
inner
catastrophe
that
might
be
death
that
it
would
be
out
of
the
body
i
mean
or
a
going
backwards
in
reality
it
was
a
going
forwards
and
a
way
to
life
vii
and
it
was
just
before
the
steamer
made
naples
that
the
jolly
captain
unwittingly
helped
matters
forward
a
good
deal
for
it
was
his
ambition
to
include
in
the
of
his
vessel
the
also
of
his
passengers
he
liked
to
see
them
contented
and
of
one
accord
a
big
family
and
he
noted
or
had
word
brought
to
him
perhaps
that
there
were
one
or
two
whom
the
attitude
of
the
majority
left
out
in
the
cold
it
may
have
been
wondered
without
actually
asking
that
the
man
who
shared
the
cabin
with
the
strangers
made
some
appeal
for
but
in
any
case
captain
burgenfelder
approached
the
irishman
that
afternoon
on
the
bridge
and
asked
if
he
would
object
to
having
them
in
his
stateroom
for
the
balance
of
the
voyage
your
present
gompanion
geds
off
at
naples
he
said
berhaps
you
would
not
object
i
think
they
seem
lonely
you
are
friendly
with
them
they
go
alzo
to
batoum
this
proposal
for
close
quarters
gave
him
pause
he
knew
a
moment
or
two
of
grave
hesitation
yet
without
time
to
analyze
it
then
driven
by
a
sudden
decision
of
the
heart
that
knew
no
revision
of
reason
he
agreed
i
had
better
perhaps
suggest
it
to
see
if
they
are
willing
he
said
the
next
minute
hedging
i
already
ask
him
dat
oh
you
have
and
he
would
like
it
not
object
i
mean
he
added
aware
of
a
subtle
sense
of
pleasure
pleased
and
flattered
on
the
contrary
was
the
reply
as
he
handed
him
the
glasses
to
look
at
ischia
rising
blue
from
the
sea
felt
as
though
his
decision
was
somehow
an
act
of
almost
grave
it
meant
that
impulsively
he
accepted
a
friendship
which
concealed
in
its
immense
attraction
danger
he
had
taken
the
plunge
the
rush
of
it
broke
over
him
like
a
wave
setting
free
a
tumult
of
very
deep
emotion
he
raised
the
glasses
automatically
to
his
eyes
but
looking
through
them
he
saw
not
ischia
nor
the
opening
the
captain
explained
the
ship
would
make
heading
that
evening
for
sicily
he
saw
quite
another
picture
that
drew
itself
up
out
of
himself
was
thrown
up
rather
somewhat
with
violence
as
upon
a
landscape
of
the
lens
of
passionate
yearning
in
himself
ever
unsatisfied
focused
it
against
a
background
far
far
away
in
some
faint
distance
that
was
neither
of
space
nor
time
and
might
equally
have
been
past
as
future
large
figures
he
saw
shadowy
yet
splendid
that
ran
as
clouds
over
mighty
hills
vital
with
the
abundant
strong
life
of
a
younger
world
yet
never
quite
saw
them
never
quite
overtook
them
for
their
speed
and
the
manner
of
their
motion
bewildered
the
sight
moreover
though
they
evaded
him
in
terms
of
physical
definition
he
knew
a
sense
of
curious
familiarity
some
portion
of
his
hidden
self
uncaught
unharnessed
by
anything
in
modern
life
rose
with
a
passionate
rush
of
joy
and
made
after
them
something
in
him
untamed
as
wind
his
mind
stood
up
as
it
were
and
shouted
i
am
coming
for
he
saw
himself
not
far
behind
as
a
man
racing
with
great
leaps
to
join
them
yet
never
overtaking
never
drawing
close
enough
to
see
quite
clearly
the
roar
of
their
tramping
shook
the
very
blood
in
his
ears
his
decision
to
accept
the
strangers
had
set
free
in
his
being
something
that
thus
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
escaped
symbolically
in
his
mind
this
escape
had
taken
picture
form
the
captain
voice
was
asking
for
the
glasses
with
a
wrench
that
caused
almost
actual
physical
pain
he
tore
himself
away
letting
this
herd
of
flying
thoughts
sink
back
into
the
shadows
and
disappear
with
sharp
regret
he
saw
them
go
a
regret
for
long
long
things
turning
he
placed
the
carefully
in
that
fat
open
hand
stretched
out
to
receive
them
and
noted
as
he
did
so
the
thick
pink
fingers
that
closed
about
the
strap
the
heavy
ring
of
gold
the
band
of
gilt
about
the
sleeve
that
wrought
gold
those
fleshy
fingers
the
genial
gutteral
voice
saying
were
symbols
of
an
existence
tamed
and
artificial
that
caged
him
in
again
then
he
went
below
and
found
that
the
lazy
drummer
who
talked
to
puzzled
peasants
had
landed
and
in
his
place
an
assortment
of
indiscriminate
clothing
belonging
to
the
big
russian
and
his
son
lay
scattered
over
the
upper
berth
and
upon
the
beneath
the
viii
for
my
own
part
i
find
in
some
of
these
abnormal
or
supernormal
facts
the
strongest
suggestions
in
favor
of
a
superior
consciousness
being
possible
i
doubt
whether
we
shall
ever
understand
some
of
them
without
using
the
very
letter
of
fechner
conception
of
a
great
reservoir
in
which
the
memories
of
earth
inhabitants
are
pooled
and
preserved
and
from
which
when
the
threshold
lowers
or
the
valve
opens
information
ordinarily
shut
out
leaks
into
the
mind
of
exceptional
individuals
among
us
william
james
pluralistic
and
it
was
some
hours
later
while
the
ship
made
for
the
open
sea
that
he
told
stahl
casually
of
the
new
arrangement
and
saw
the
change
come
so
suddenly
across
his
face
stahl
stood
back
from
the
whereon
they
leaned
and
putting
a
hand
upon
his
companion
shoulder
looked
a
moment
into
his
eyes
with
surprise
noted
that
the
pose
of
cynical
disbelief
was
gone
in
its
place
was
sympathy
interest
kindness
the
words
he
spoke
came
from
his
heart
is
that
true
he
asked
as
though
the
news
disturbed
him
of
course
why
not
is
there
anything
wrong
he
felt
uneasy
the
doctor
manner
confirmed
the
sense
that
he
had
done
a
rash
thing
instantly
the
barrier
between
the
two
crumbled
and
he
lost
the
first
feeling
of
resentment
that
his
friends
should
be
analyzed
the
men
thus
came
together
in
unhindered
sincerity
only
said
the
doctor
thoughtfully
half
gravely
that
i
may
have
done
you
a
wrong
placed
you
that
is
in
a
position
of
he
hesitated
an
instant
of
difficulty
it
was
i
who
suggested
the
change
stared
at
him
i
do
understand
you
quite
it
is
this
continued
the
other
still
holding
him
with
his
eyes
he
said
it
deliberately
i
have
known
you
for
some
time
an
opinion
of
your
type
of
mind
and
being
a
very
rare
and
curious
one
interesting
me
deeply
i
was
aware
you
had
me
under
the
microscope
laughed
but
restlessly
though
you
felt
it
and
resented
it
justly
i
may
say
to
the
point
of
sometimes
avoiding
me
as
doctor
scientist
put
in
while
the
other
ignoring
the
interruption
continued
in
german
i
always
had
the
secret
hope
as
and
scientist
let
us
put
it
then
that
i
might
one
day
see
you
in
circumstances
that
should
bring
out
certain
latent
characteristics
i
thought
i
divined
in
you
i
wished
to
observe
you
your
psychical
being
under
the
stress
of
certain
temptations
favorable
to
these
characteristics
our
brief
voyages
together
though
they
have
so
kindly
ripened
our
acquaintance
into
friendship
he
put
his
hand
again
on
the
other
shoulder
smiling
while
replied
with
a
little
nod
of
agreement
have
of
course
never
provided
the
opportunity
i
refer
to
ah
until
now
the
doctor
added
until
now
puzzled
and
interested
the
irishman
waited
for
him
to
go
on
but
the
man
of
science
who
was
now
a
ship
doctor
hesitated
he
found
it
difficult
apparently
to
say
what
was
in
his
thoughts
you
refer
of
course
though
i
hardly
follow
you
quite
to
our
big
friends
helped
him
the
adjective
slipped
out
before
he
was
aware
of
it
his
expression
admitted
the
accuracy
of
the
remark
you
also
see
them
big
then
he
said
quickly
taking
him
up
he
was
not
out
of
keen
sympathetic
interest
he
asked
it
sometimes
yes
the
irishman
answered
more
astonished
sometimes
only
exactly
bigger
than
they
really
are
as
though
at
times
they
gave
out
emanated
something
that
extended
their
appearance
is
that
it
his
confidence
wholly
won
more
surprised
too
than
he
quite
understood
seized
stahl
by
the
arm
and
drew
him
toward
the
rails
they
leaned
over
watching
the
sea
a
passenger
pacing
the
decks
before
dinner
passed
close
behind
them
but
doctor
he
said
in
a
hushed
tone
as
soon
as
the
steps
had
died
away
you
are
saying
things
that
i
thought
were
half
in
my
imagination
only
not
true
in
the
ordinary
sense
quite
your
sense
i
mean
for
some
moments
the
doctor
made
no
reply
in
his
eyes
a
curious
steady
gaze
replaced
the
usual
twinkle
when
at
length
he
spoke
it
was
evidently
following
a
train
of
thought
of
his
own
playing
round
a
subject
he
seemed
half
ashamed
of
and
yet
desired
to
state
with
direct
language
a
being
akin
to
yourself
he
said
in
low
tones
only
developed
enormously
developed
a
master
in
your
own
peculiar
region
and
a
man
whose
influence
acting
upon
you
at
close
quarters
could
not
fail
to
arouse
the
latent
he
chose
the
word
hesitatingly
as
though
seeking
for
a
better
he
could
not
find
on
the
moment
always
brewing
in
you
just
below
the
horizon
he
turned
and
watched
his
companion
face
keenly
was
too
impressed
to
feel
annoyance
well
he
asked
feeling
the
adventure
closing
round
him
with
quite
a
new
sense
of
reality
well
he
repeated
louder
please
go
on
i
not
offended
only
uncommonly
interested
you
leave
me
in
a
fog
so
far
i
think
you
owe
me
more
than
hints
i
do
said
the
other
simply
about
that
man
is
a
singular
quality
too
rare
for
language
to
have
yet
coined
its
precise
description
something
that
is
essentially
they
had
lapsed
into
german
now
and
he
used
the
german
word
the
irishman
started
he
recognized
this
for
truth
at
the
same
time
the
old
resentment
stirred
a
little
in
him
creeping
into
his
reply
you
have
studied
him
closely
then
had
him
too
under
the
microscope
in
this
short
time
this
time
the
answer
did
not
surprise
him
however
my
friend
he
heard
while
the
other
turned
from
him
and
gazed
out
over
the
misty
sea
i
have
not
been
a
ship
doctor
always
i
am
one
now
only
because
the
leisure
and
quiet
give
me
the
opportunity
to
finish
certain
work
recording
work
for
years
i
was
in
the
h
he
mentioned
the
german
equivalent
for
the
salpêtrière
years
of
research
and
investigation
into
the
astonishing
vagaries
of
the
human
mind
and
spirit
with
certain
results
followed
later
privately
that
it
is
now
my
work
to
record
and
among
many
cases
that
might
well
seem
er
beyond
either
credence
or
explanation
he
hesitated
again
slightly
i
came
across
one
one
in
a
million
let
us
admit
that
an
entire
section
of
my
work
deals
with
under
the
generic
term
of
primitive
men
snapped
him
up
translating
through
his
growing
bewilderment
ran
also
a
growing
uneasiness
shot
strangely
with
delight
intuitively
he
divined
what
was
coming
beings
the
doctor
corrected
him
not
men
the
prefix
moreover
i
use
in
a
deeper
sense
than
is
usually
attached
to
it
as
in
and
the
like
an
in
the
world
today
must
suggest
a
survival
of
an
almost
incredible
kind
a
kind
too
utterly
inadmissible
and
inexplicable
to
the
materialist
perhaps
paganistic
interrupted
the
other
sharply
joy
and
fright
rising
over
him
older
older
by
far
was
the
rejoinder
given
with
a
curious
hush
and
a
lowering
of
the
voice
the
suggestion
rushed
into
full
possession
of
mind
there
rose
in
him
something
that
claimed
for
his
companions
the
sea
the
wind
the
stars
tumultuous
and
terrific
but
he
said
nothing
the
conception
blown
into
him
thus
for
the
first
time
at
full
strength
took
all
his
life
into
its
keeping
no
energy
was
left
over
for
mere
words
the
doctor
he
was
aware
was
looking
at
him
the
passion
of
discovery
and
belief
in
his
eyes
his
manner
kindled
it
was
the
hidden
stahl
emerging
a
type
let
me
put
it
he
went
on
in
a
voice
whose
very
steadiness
thrilled
his
listener
afresh
that
in
its
strongest
development
would
experience
in
the
world
today
the
loneliness
of
a
complete
and
absolute
exile
a
return
to
humanity
you
see
of
some
unexpended
power
of
mythological
values
doctor
the
shudder
passed
through
him
and
away
almost
as
soon
as
it
came
again
the
sea
grew
splendid
the
thunder
of
the
waves
held
voices
calling
and
the
foam
framed
shapes
and
faces
wildly
seductive
though
fugitive
as
dreams
the
words
he
had
heard
moved
him
profoundly
he
remembered
how
the
presence
of
the
stranger
had
turned
the
world
alive
he
knew
what
was
coming
too
and
gave
the
lead
direct
while
yet
half
afraid
to
ask
the
question
so
my
friend
this
big
i
have
known
before
yes
and
carefully
studied
ix
is
it
not
just
possible
that
there
is
a
mode
of
being
as
much
transcending
intelligence
and
will
as
these
transcend
mechanical
motion
herbert
spencer
the
two
men
left
the
rail
and
walked
arm
in
arm
along
the
deserted
deck
speaking
in
lowered
voices
he
came
first
to
us
brought
by
the
keeper
of
an
obscure
hotel
where
he
was
staying
as
a
case
of
lapse
of
memory
loss
of
memory
i
should
say
for
it
was
complete
he
was
unable
to
say
who
he
was
whence
he
came
or
to
whom
he
belonged
of
his
land
or
people
we
could
learn
nothing
his
antecedents
were
an
utter
blank
speech
he
had
practically
none
of
his
own
nothing
but
the
merest
smattering
of
many
tongues
a
word
here
a
word
there
utterance
indeed
of
any
kind
was
exceedingly
difficult
to
him
for
years
evidently
he
had
wandered
over
the
world
companionless
among
men
seeking
his
own
finding
no
place
where
to
lay
his
head
people
it
seemed
both
men
and
women
kept
him
at
feeling
afraid
the
keeper
of
the
little
hotel
was
clearly
terrified
this
quality
he
had
that
i
mentioned
just
now
repelled
human
beings
even
in
the
hospital
it
was
noticeable
and
placed
him
in
the
midst
of
humanity
thus
absolutely
alone
it
is
a
quality
more
rare
than
hesitating
searching
for
a
word
purity
one
almost
extinct
today
one
that
i
have
never
before
or
since
come
across
in
any
other
being
hardly
ever
that
is
to
say
he
qualified
the
sentence
glancing
significantly
at
his
companion
and
the
boy
asked
quickly
anxious
to
avoid
any
discussion
of
himself
there
was
no
boy
then
he
has
found
him
since
he
may
find
others
too
possibly
the
irishman
drew
his
arm
out
edging
away
imperceptibly
that
shiver
of
joy
reached
him
from
the
air
and
sea
perhaps
and
two
years
ago
continued
stahl
as
if
nothing
had
happened
he
was
discharged
harmless
he
lingered
a
moment
on
the
word
if
not
cured
he
was
to
report
to
us
every
six
months
he
has
never
done
so
you
think
he
remembers
you
no
it
is
quite
clear
that
he
has
lapsed
back
completely
again
into
the
er
state
whence
he
came
to
us
that
unknown
world
where
he
passed
his
youth
with
others
of
his
kind
but
of
which
he
has
been
able
to
reveal
no
single
detail
to
us
nor
we
to
trace
the
slightest
clue
they
stopped
beneath
the
covered
portion
of
the
deck
for
the
mist
had
now
turned
to
rain
they
leaned
against
the
outer
wall
in
mind
the
thoughts
and
feelings
plunged
and
reared
only
with
difficulty
did
he
control
himself
and
this
man
you
think
he
asked
with
outward
calmness
is
of
of
my
kind
i
said
i
suggest
but
cut
him
short
so
that
you
engineered
our
sharing
a
cabin
with
a
view
to
putting
him
again
putting
us
both
under
the
microscope
my
scientific
interest
was
very
strong
stahl
replied
carefully
but
it
is
not
too
late
to
change
i
offer
you
a
bed
in
my
own
roomy
cabin
on
the
promenade
deck
also
i
ask
your
forgiveness
the
irishman
large
though
his
imaginative
creed
was
felt
oddly
checked
baffled
stupefied
by
what
he
had
heard
he
knew
perfectly
well
what
stahl
was
driving
at
and
that
revelations
of
another
kind
were
yet
to
follow
what
bereft
him
of
very
definite
speech
was
this
new
fact
slowly
awakening
in
his
consciousness
which
hypnotized
him
as
it
were
with
its
grandeur
it
seemed
to
portend
that
his
own
primitive
yearnings
grew
out
of
far
deeper
foundations
than
he
had
yet
dreamed
of
even
stahl
should
he
choose
to
listen
meant
to
give
him
explanation
explanation
this
talk
about
a
survival
of
unexpended
mythological
values
carried
him
off
his
feet
he
knew
it
was
true
veiled
behind
that
carefully
chosen
phrase
was
something
more
a
truth
brilliantly
discovered
he
knew
too
that
it
bit
at
the
upon
which
his
personality
his
sanity
his
very
life
perhaps
rested
his
modern
life
i
forgive
you
stahl
he
heard
himself
saying
with
a
deceptive
calmness
of
voice
as
they
stood
shoulder
to
shoulder
in
that
dark
corner
for
there
is
really
nothing
to
forgive
the
characteristics
of
these
you
describe
attract
me
very
greatly
your
words
merely
give
my
imagination
a
letter
of
introduction
to
my
reason
they
burrow
among
the
foundations
of
my
life
and
being
at
least
you
have
done
me
no
wrong
he
knew
the
words
were
wild
impulsive
yet
he
could
find
no
better
above
all
things
he
wished
to
conceal
his
rising
grand
delight
i
thank
you
stahl
said
simply
yet
with
a
certain
confusion
i
felt
i
owed
you
this
explanation
er
this
confession
you
wished
to
warn
me
i
wished
to
say
careful
rather
i
say
it
now
be
careful
i
give
you
this
invitation
to
share
my
cabin
for
the
remainder
of
the
voyage
and
i
urge
you
to
accept
it
the
offer
was
from
the
heart
while
the
scientific
interest
in
the
man
obviously
half
hoped
for
a
refusal
you
think
harm
might
come
to
me
not
physically
the
man
is
gentle
and
safe
in
every
way
but
there
danger
in
your
opinion
insisted
the
other
there
danger
that
his
influence
may
make
me
as
himself
an
that
he
may
get
you
was
the
curious
answer
given
steadily
after
a
moment
pause
again
the
words
thrilled
to
the
core
of
his
delighted
soul
you
really
mean
that
he
asked
again
as
and
scientist
you
mean
it
stahl
replied
with
a
solemn
anxiety
in
eyes
and
voice
i
mean
that
you
have
in
yourself
that
which
makes
the
proximity
of
this
dangerous
in
a
word
that
he
may
take
you
er
with
him
conversion
appropriation
they
moved
further
up
the
deck
together
for
some
minutes
in
silence
but
the
irishman
feelings
irritated
by
the
man
prolonged
evasion
reached
a
degree
of
impatience
that
was
almost
anger
let
us
be
more
definite
he
exclaimed
at
length
a
trifle
hotly
you
mean
that
i
might
go
insane
not
in
the
ordinary
sense
came
the
answer
without
a
sign
of
annoyance
or
hesitation
but
that
something
might
happen
to
you
something
that
science
could
not
recognize
and
medical
science
could
not
treat
then
interrupted
him
with
the
vital
question
that
rushed
out
before
he
could
consider
its
wisdom
or
legitimacy
then
what
really
is
he
this
man
this
whom
you
call
a
and
who
makes
you
fear
for
my
safety
tell
me
what
he
is
they
found
themselves
just
then
by
the
doctor
cabin
and
stahl
pushing
the
door
open
led
him
in
taking
the
sofa
for
himself
he
pointed
to
an
armchair
opposite
x
superstition
is
outside
reason
so
is
revelation
old
saying
and
understood
that
he
had
pressed
the
doctor
to
the
verge
of
confessing
some
belief
that
he
was
ashamed
to
utter
or
to
hold
something
forced
upon
him
by
his
experience
of
life
to
which
his
scientific
training
said
peremptorily
no
further
that
he
watched
him
keenly
all
the
time
noting
the
effect
his
words
produced
he
is
not
a
human
being
at
all
he
continued
with
a
queer
thin
whisper
that
conveyed
a
gravity
of
conviction
singularly
impressive
in
the
sense
in
which
you
and
i
are
accustomed
to
use
the
term
his
inner
being
is
not
shaped
as
his
outer
body
upon
quite
human
lines
he
is
a
cosmic
being
a
direct
expression
of
cosmic
life
a
little
bit
a
fragment
of
the
soul
of
the
world
and
in
that
sense
a
survival
a
survival
of
her
youth
the
irishman
as
he
listened
to
these
utterly
unexpected
words
felt
something
rise
within
him
that
threatened
to
tear
him
asunder
whether
it
was
joy
or
terror
or
compounded
strangely
of
the
two
he
could
not
tell
it
seemed
as
if
he
stood
upon
the
edge
of
hearing
something
spoken
by
a
man
who
was
no
mere
dreamer
like
himself
that
would
explain
the
world
himself
and
all
his
wildest
cravings
he
both
longed
and
feared
to
hear
it
in
his
hidden
and
most
secret
thoughts
those
thoughts
he
never
uttered
to
another
this
deep
belief
in
the
earth
as
a
conscious
sentient
living
being
had
persisted
in
spite
of
all
the
forces
education
and
modern
life
had
turned
against
it
it
seemed
in
him
an
undying
instinct
an
unmovable
conviction
though
he
hardly
dared
acknowledge
it
even
to
himself
he
had
always
dreamed
the
earth
alive
a
mothering
organism
to
humanity
and
himself
his
love
of
nature
in
some
sweet
close
relation
to
her
that
other
men
had
forgotten
or
ignored
now
therefore
to
hear
stahl
talk
of
cosmic
beings
fragments
of
the
soul
of
the
world
and
survivals
of
her
early
life
was
like
hearing
a
great
shout
of
command
to
his
soul
to
come
forth
and
share
it
in
complete
acknowledgment
he
bit
his
lips
pinched
himself
stared
then
he
took
the
black
cigar
he
was
aware
was
being
handed
to
him
lit
it
with
fingers
that
trembled
absurdly
and
smoked
as
hard
as
though
his
sanity
depended
on
his
finishing
it
in
a
prescribed
time
great
clouds
rose
before
his
face
but
his
soul
within
him
came
up
with
a
flaming
rush
of
speed
shouting
singing
there
was
enough
ash
to
knock
off
into
the
bronze
tray
beside
him
before
either
said
a
word
he
watched
the
little
operation
as
closely
as
though
he
were
aiming
a
rifle
the
ash
he
saw
broke
firmly
this
must
be
a
really
good
cigar
he
thought
to
himself
for
as
yet
he
had
not
been
conscious
of
tasting
it
the
he
also
saw
was
a
kind
of
nymph
her
spread
drapery
forming
the
receptacle
i
must
get
one
of
those
he
thought
i
wonder
what
they
cost
then
he
puffed
violently
again
the
doctor
had
risen
and
was
pacing
the
cabin
floor
slowly
over
by
the
red
curtain
that
concealed
the
bunk
watched
him
and
as
he
did
so
the
words
he
had
heard
kept
on
roaring
at
the
back
of
his
mind
and
then
while
silence
still
held
the
room
swift
too
as
a
second
although
it
takes
time
to
write
flashed
through
him
a
memory
of
fechner
the
german
philosopher
who
held
that
the
universe
was
everywhere
consciously
alive
and
that
the
earth
was
the
body
of
a
living
entity
and
that
the
or
cosmic
consciousness
is
something
more
than
a
picturesque
dream
of
the
ancients
the
doctor
came
to
anchor
again
on
the
sofa
opposite
to
his
great
relief
he
was
the
first
to
break
the
silence
for
simply
did
not
know
how
or
where
to
begin
we
know
today
certainly
know
for
i
read
it
accurately
described
in
your
books
that
the
human
personality
can
extend
itself
under
certain
conditions
called
abnormal
it
can
project
portions
of
itself
show
itself
even
at
a
distance
operate
away
from
the
central
covering
body
in
exactly
similar
fashion
may
the
being
of
the
earth
have
projected
portions
of
herself
in
the
past
of
such
great
powers
or
beings
there
may
be
conceivably
a
survival
a
survival
of
a
hugely
remote
period
when
her
consciousness
was
manifested
perhaps
in
shapes
and
forms
long
since
withdrawn
before
the
tide
of
advancing
humanity
forms
of
which
poetry
and
legend
alone
have
caught
a
flying
memory
and
called
them
gods
monsters
mythical
beings
of
all
sorts
and
kinds
and
then
suddenly
as
though
he
had
been
deliberately
giving
his
imagination
rein
yet
now
regretted
it
his
voice
altered
his
manner
assumed
a
shade
of
something
colder
he
shifted
the
key
as
though
to
another
aspect
of
his
belief
the
man
was
talking
swiftly
of
his
experiences
in
the
big
and
private
hospitals
he
was
describing
very
belief
to
which
he
had
first
found
himself
driven
the
belief
that
had
opened
the
door
to
so
much
more
so
far
as
could
follow
it
in
his
curiously
excited
condition
of
mind
it
was
little
more
or
less
than
a
belief
he
himself
had
often
played
lovingly
with
the
theory
that
a
man
has
a
fluid
or
etheric
counterpart
of
himself
which
is
obedient
to
strong
desire
and
can
under
certain
conditions
be
detached
projected
in
a
shape
dictated
by
that
desire
he
only
realized
this
fully
later
perhaps
for
the
doctor
used
a
phraseology
of
his
own
stahl
was
telling
calmly
how
he
had
been
driven
to
some
such
belief
by
the
facts
that
had
come
under
his
notice
both
in
the
asylums
and
in
his
private
practice
that
in
the
amazingly
complex
personality
of
a
human
being
he
went
on
there
does
exist
some
vital
constituent
a
part
of
consciousness
that
can
leave
the
body
for
a
short
time
without
involving
death
that
it
is
something
occasionally
visible
to
others
something
malleable
by
thought
and
desire
especially
by
intense
and
prolonged
yearning
and
that
it
can
even
bring
relief
to
its
owner
by
satisfying
in
some
subjective
fashion
the
very
yearnings
that
drew
it
forth
doctor
you
mean
the
there
is
no
name
i
know
of
i
can
give
it
none
i
mean
in
other
words
that
it
can
create
the
conditions
for
such
satisfaction
perhaps
yet
intense
and
seemingly
very
real
at
the
time
great
emotion
for
instance
drives
it
forth
explaining
thus
appearances
at
a
distance
and
a
hundred
other
phenomena
that
my
investigations
of
abnormal
personality
have
forced
me
to
recognize
as
true
and
nostalgia
often
is
the
means
of
egress
the
channel
along
which
all
the
inner
forces
and
desires
of
the
heart
stream
elsewhere
toward
their
fulfillment
in
some
person
place
or
stahl
was
giving
himself
his
head
talking
freely
of
beliefs
that
rarely
found
utterance
clearly
it
was
a
relief
to
him
to
do
so
to
let
himself
be
carried
away
there
was
after
all
the
poet
in
him
side
by
side
with
the
observer
and
analyst
and
the
fundamental
contradiction
in
his
character
stood
most
interestingly
revealed
listened
half
in
a
dream
wondering
what
this
had
to
do
with
the
cosmic
life
just
mentioned
moreover
the
appearance
the
aspect
of
this
etheric
double
molded
thus
by
thought
longing
and
desire
corresponds
to
such
thought
longing
and
desire
its
shape
when
visible
shape
is
assumed
may
be
various
very
various
the
form
might
conceivably
be
discerned
clairvoyantly
as
an
emanation
rather
than
actually
seen
he
continued
then
he
added
looking
closely
at
his
companion
and
in
your
own
case
this
double
it
has
always
seemed
to
me
may
be
peculiarly
easy
of
detachment
from
the
rest
of
you
i
certainly
create
my
own
world
and
slip
into
it
to
some
extent
murmured
the
irishman
absorbingly
interested
reverie
and
so
forth
partially
at
any
rate
yes
in
your
reveries
of
waking
consciousness
stahl
took
him
up
but
in
sleep
in
the
trance
consciousness
completely
and
therein
lies
your
danger
he
added
gravely
for
to
pass
out
completely
in
consciousness
is
the
next
step
an
easy
one
and
it
constitutes
not
so
much
a
disorder
of
your
being
as
a
readjustment
but
a
readjustment
difficult
of
sane
control
he
paused
again
you
pass
out
while
fully
awake
a
waking
delusion
it
is
usually
labeled
though
in
my
opinion
wrongly
so
insanity
i
not
afraid
of
that
laughed
almost
nettled
i
can
manage
myself
all
right
have
done
so
far
at
any
rate
it
was
curious
how
the
rôles
had
shifted
it
was
now
who
checked
and
criticized
i
suggest
caution
was
the
reply
made
earnestly
i
suggest
caution
i
should
keep
your
warnings
for
mediums
clairvoyants
and
the
like
said
the
other
tartly
he
was
half
amazed
half
alarmed
even
while
he
said
it
it
was
the
personal
application
that
annoyed
him
they
are
rather
apt
to
go
off
their
heads
i
believe
stahl
rose
and
stood
before
him
as
though
the
words
had
given
him
a
cue
he
wanted
from
that
very
he
said
my
most
suggestive
have
come
though
not
for
one
moment
do
i
think
of
including
you
with
them
yet
these
very
have
been
due
one
and
all
to
the
same
cause
the
singular
disorder
i
have
just
mentioned
they
stared
at
one
another
a
moment
in
silence
stahl
whether
liked
it
or
no
was
impressive
he
gazed
at
the
little
figure
in
front
of
him
the
ragged
untidy
beard
the
light
shining
on
the
bald
skull
wondering
what
was
coming
next
and
what
all
this
bewildering
confession
of
unorthodox
belief
was
leading
up
to
he
longed
to
hear
more
about
that
hinted
cosmic
life
and
how
yearning
might
lead
to
its
realization
for
any
phenomena
of
the
that
may
be
genuine
he
heard
him
saying
are
produced
by
this
fluid
detachable
portion
of
the
personality
the
very
thing
we
have
been
speaking
about
they
are
projections
of
the
personality
automatic
projections
of
the
consciousness
and
then
like
a
clap
of
thunder
upon
his
bewildered
mind
came
this
man
amazing
ultimatum
linking
together
all
the
points
touched
upon
and
bringing
them
to
a
head
he
repeated
it
emphatically
and
in
similar
fashion
concluded
the
calm
dispassionate
voice
beside
him
there
have
been
projections
of
the
earth
great
consciousness
direct
expressions
of
her
cosmic
life
cosmic
beings
and
of
these
distant
and
primitive
manifestations
it
is
conceivable
that
one
or
two
may
still
here
and
there
in
places
humanity
has
never
stained
actually
survive
this
man
is
one
of
them
he
turned
on
the
two
electric
lights
behind
him
with
an
admirable
air
of
finality
the
extraordinary
talk
was
at
an
end
he
moved
about
the
cabin
putting
chairs
straight
and
toying
with
the
papers
on
his
desk
occasionally
he
threw
a
swift
and
searching
glance
at
his
companion
like
a
man
who
wished
to
note
the
effect
of
an
attack
for
indeed
this
was
the
impression
that
his
listener
retained
above
all
else
this
flood
of
wild
unorthodox
speculative
ideas
had
been
poured
upon
him
with
a
purpose
and
the
abruptness
of
the
climax
was
cleverly
planned
to
induce
impulsive
hot
confession
but
found
no
words
he
sat
there
in
his
armchair
passing
his
fingers
through
his
tumbled
hair
his
inner
turmoil
was
too
much
for
speech
or
questions
and
presently
when
the
gong
for
dinner
rang
noisily
outside
the
cabin
door
he
rose
abruptly
and
went
out
without
a
single
word
stahl
turned
to
see
him
go
he
merely
nodded
with
a
little
smile
but
he
did
not
go
to
his
stateroom
he
walked
the
deck
alone
for
a
time
and
when
he
reached
the
dining
room
stahl
he
saw
had
already
come
and
gone
halfway
down
the
table
diagonally
across
the
face
of
the
big
russian
looked
up
occasionally
at
him
and
smiled
and
every
time
he
did
so
the
irishman
felt
a
sense
of
mingled
alarm
and
wonder
greater
than
anything
he
had
ever
known
in
his
life
before
one
of
the
great
doors
of
life
again
had
opened
the
barriers
of
his
heart
broke
away
he
was
no
longer
caged
and
manacled
within
the
prison
of
a
puny
individuality
the
world
that
so
distressed
him
faded
the
people
in
it
were
dolls
the
the
armenian
priest
the
tourists
and
the
rest
were
mere
automatic
puppets
all
made
to
scale
petty
scale
amazingly
dull
all
exactly
alike
tiny
unreal
half
alive
the
ship
meanwhile
he
reflected
with
a
joy
that
was
passion
was
being
borne
over
the
blue
sea
and
this
sea
lay
spread
upon
the
curved
breast
of
the
round
and
spinning
earth
he
too
and
the
big
russian
lay
upon
her
breast
held
close
by
gravity
caught
closer
still
though
by
something
else
besides
and
his
longings
increased
with
his
understanding
stahl
wittingly
or
unwittingly
had
given
them
an
immense
push
forwards
xi
in
scientific
terms
one
can
say
consciousness
is
everywhere
it
is
awake
when
and
wherever
the
bodily
energy
underlying
the
spiritual
exceeds
that
degree
of
strength
which
we
call
the
threshold
according
to
this
consciousness
can
be
localized
in
time
and
space

the
offer
of
the
cabin
meanwhile
remained
open
in
the
solitude
that
found
necessary
that
evening
he
toyed
with
it
though
knowing
that
he
would
never
really
accept
like
a
true
celt
his
imagination
took
the
main
body
of
stahl
words
and
ensouled
them
with
his
own
vivid
temperament
there
stirred
in
him
this
nameless
and
disquieting
joy
that
wrought
for
itself
a
body
from
material
just
beyond
his
thoughts
that
region
of
enormous
experience
that
ever
fringes
the
consciousness
of
imaginative
men
he
took
the
picture
at
its
face
value
took
it
inside
with
his
own
thoughts
delighted
in
it
raised
it
of
course
very
soon
to
a
still
higher
scale
if
he
criticized
at
all
it
was
with
phrases
like
the
man
a
poet
after
all
why
he
got
creative
imagination
to
find
his
own
intuitions
endorsed
even
half
explained
by
a
mind
of
opposite
type
was
a
new
experience
it
emphasized
amazingly
the
reality
of
that
inner
world
he
lived
in
this
explanation
of
the
big
russian
effect
upon
himself
was
terrific
and
that
a
doctor
should
have
conceived
it
glorious
that
some
portion
of
a
man
spirit
might
assume
the
shape
of
his
thoughts
and
project
itself
visibly
seemed
likely
enough
indeed
to
him
it
seemed
already
a
fact
and
his
temperament
did
not
linger
over
it
but
that
other
suggestion
fairly
savaged
him
with
its
strange
grandeur
he
played
lovingly
with
it
that
the
earth
was
a
living
being
was
a
conception
divine
in
size
as
in
simplicity
and
that
the
gods
and
mythological
figures
had
been
projections
of
her
consciousness
this
thought
ran
with
a
magnificent
new
thunder
about
his
mind
it
was
overwhelming
beautiful
as
heaven
and
as
gracious
he
saw
the
ancient
shapes
of
myth
and
legend
still
alive
in
some
gorgeous
garden
of
the
primal
world
a
corner
too
remote
for
humanity
to
have
yet
stained
it
with
their
trail
of
uglier
life
he
understood
in
quite
a
new
way
at
last
those
deep
primitive
longings
that
hitherto
had
vainly
craved
their
full
acknowledgment
it
meant
that
he
lay
so
close
to
the
earth
that
he
felt
her
pulses
as
his
own
the
idea
stormed
his
belief
it
was
the
soul
of
the
earth
herself
that
all
these
years
had
been
calling
to
him
and
while
he
let
his
imagination
play
with
the
soaring
beauty
of
the
idea
he
remembered
certain
odd
little
facts
he
marshaled
them
before
him
in
a
row
and
questioned
them
the
picture
he
had
seen
with
the
captain
glasses
those
speeding
shapes
of
beauty
the
new
aspect
of
a
living
nature
that
the
russian
presence
stirred
in
him
the
broken
words
as
they
had
leaned
above
the
sea
in
the
dusk
the
curious
passion
that
leaped
to
his
eyes
when
certain
chance
words
had
touched
him
at
the
and
lastly
the
singular
impression
of
giant
bulk
he
produced
sometimes
upon
the
mind
almost
as
though
a
portion
of
him
this
detachable
portion
molded
by
the
quality
of
his
spirit
as
he
felt
himself
to
be
emerged
visibly
to
cause
it
vaguely
in
this
way
divined
how
inevitable
was
the
apparent
isolation
of
these
two
and
why
others
instinctively
avoided
them
they
seemed
by
themselves
in
an
enclosure
where
the
parent
lumberingly
and
the
boy
defiantly
disported
themselves
with
a
kind
of
lonely
majesty
that
forbade
approach
and
it
was
later
that
same
night
as
the
steamer
approached
the
lipari
islands
that
the
drive
forward
he
had
received
from
the
doctor
words
was
increased
by
a
succession
of
singular
occurrences
at
the
same
time
stahl
deliberate
and
as
he
deemed
it
unjustifiable
interference
helped
him
to
make
up
his
mind
decisively
on
certain
other
points
the
first
occurrence
was
of
the
same
order
as
the
bigness
extraordinarily
difficult
that
is
to
confirm
by
actual
measurement
it
was
ten
stahl
still
apparently
in
his
cabin
by
himself
and
most
of
the
passengers
below
at
an
impromptu
concert
when
the
irishman
coming
down
from
his
long
solitude
caught
sight
of
the
russian
and
his
boy
moving
about
the
dark
with
a
speed
and
vigor
that
instantly
arrested
his
attention
the
suggestion
of
size
and
of
rapidity
of
movement
had
never
been
more
marked
it
was
as
though
a
cloud
of
the
summer
darkness
moved
beside
them
then
going
cautiously
nearer
he
saw
that
they
were
neither
walking
quickly
nor
running
as
he
had
first
supposed
but
to
his
amazement
were
standing
side
by
side
upon
the
deck
stock
still
the
appearance
of
motion
however
was
not
entirely
a
delusion
for
he
next
saw
that
while
standing
there
steady
as
the
mast
and
behind
them
something
emanated
from
both
their
persons
and
seemed
to
hover
and
play
about
them
something
that
was
only
approximately
of
their
own
outer
shapes
and
very
considerably
larger
now
it
veiled
them
now
left
them
clear
he
thought
of
moving
to
and
fro
about
dark
statues
so
far
as
he
could
focus
his
sight
upon
them
these
shadows
without
any
light
to
cast
them
moved
in
distorted
guise
there
on
the
deck
with
a
motion
that
was
somehow
rhythmical
a
great
movement
as
of
dance
or
gambol
as
with
the
appearance
of
bigness
he
perceived
it
first
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
when
he
looked
again
he
saw
only
two
dark
figures
motionless
he
experienced
the
sensation
a
man
sometimes
knows
on
entering
a
deserted
chamber
in
the
nighttime
and
is
aware
that
the
things
in
it
have
just
that
instant
stopped
his
arrival
puts
abrupt
end
to
some
busy
activity
they
were
engaged
in
which
begins
again
the
moment
he
goes
chairs
tables
cupboards
the
very
spots
and
patterns
of
the
wall
have
just
flown
back
to
their
usual
places
whence
they
watch
impatiently
for
his
departure
with
the
candle
this
time
on
a
deck
instead
of
in
a
room
with
his
candle
had
surprised
them
in
the
act
people
moreover
not
furniture
and
this
shadowy
gambol
this
silent
dance
of
the
emanations
immense
yet
graceful
made
him
think
of
winds
flying
visible
and
uncloaked
somewhere
across
long
hills
or
of
clouds
passing
to
a
stately
elemental
measure
over
the
blue
of
an
open
sky
his
imagery
was
confused
and
gigantic
yet
very
splendid
again
he
recalled
the
pictured
shapes
seen
with
his
mind
eye
through
the
captain
glasses
and
as
he
watched
he
felt
in
himself
what
he
called
the
wild
tearing
instinct
to
run
and
join
them
more
even
that
by
rights
he
ought
to
have
been
there
from
the
beginning
dancing
with
them
indulging
a
natural
and
instinctive
and
rhythmical
movement
that
he
had
somehow
forgotten
the
passion
in
him
was
very
strong
very
urgent
it
seems
for
he
took
a
step
forward
a
call
of
some
kind
rose
in
his
throat
and
in
another
second
he
would
have
been
similarly
cavorting
upon
the
deck
when
he
felt
his
arm
clutched
suddenly
with
vigor
from
behind
some
one
seized
him
and
held
him
back
a
german
voice
spoke
with
a
guttural
whisper
in
his
ear
stahl
crouching
and
visibly
excited
drew
him
forward
a
little
hold
up
he
heard
whispered
for
their
india
rubber
soles
slithered
on
the
wet
decks
we
shall
see
from
here
eh
see
something
at
last
he
still
whispered
sudden
anger
died
down
he
could
not
give
vent
to
it
without
making
noise
for
one
thing
and
above
all
else
he
wished
to
see
he
merely
felt
a
vague
wonder
how
long
stahl
had
been
watching
they
crouched
behind
the
lee
of
a
boat
the
outline
of
the
ship
rose
distinctly
visible
against
the
starry
sky
masts
spars
and
cordage
a
faint
gleam
came
through
the
glass
below
the
the
wheel
and
the
heaps
of
coiled
rope
beyond
rose
and
fell
with
the
motion
of
the
vessel
now
against
the
stars
now
black
against
the
phosphorescent
foam
that
trailed
along
the
sea
like
shining
lace
but
the
human
figures
he
next
saw
were
now
doing
nothing
not
even
pacing
the
deck
they
were
no
longer
of
unusual
size
either
quietly
leaning
over
the
rail
father
and
son
side
by
side
they
were
guiltless
of
anything
more
uncommon
than
gazing
into
the
sea
like
the
furniture
they
had
just
stopped
stahl
and
his
companion
waited
motionless
for
several
minutes
in
silence
there
was
no
sound
but
the
dull
thunder
of
the
screws
and
a
faint
windy
whistle
the
ship
speed
made
in
the
rigging
the
passengers
were
all
below
then
suddenly
a
burst
of
music
came
up
as
some
one
opened
a
saloon
and
as
quickly
closed
it
again
a
tenor
voice
singing
to
the
piano
some
trivial
modern
song
with
a
trashy
sentimental
lilt
it
was
in
this
setting
of
sea
and
sky
painful
caught
himself
thinking
of
a
in
a
greek
temple
the
same
instant
father
and
son
as
though
startled
moved
slowly
away
down
the
deck
into
the
further
darkness
and
stahl
tightened
his
grip
of
the
irishman
arm
with
a
force
that
almost
made
him
cry
out
a
gleam
of
light
from
the
opened
had
fallen
about
them
before
they
moved
quite
clearly
it
revealed
them
bending
busily
over
heads
close
together
necks
and
shoulders
thrust
forward
and
down
a
little
look
by
god
whispered
stahl
hoarsely
as
they
moved
off
a
third
he
pointed
where
the
two
had
been
standing
something
indeed
still
remained
concealed
hitherto
by
their
bulk
this
other
figure
had
been
left
they
saw
its
large
dim
outline
it
moved
apparently
it
began
to
climb
over
the
rails
or
to
move
in
some
way
just
outside
them
hanging
half
above
the
sea
there
was
a
free
swaying
movement
about
it
not
ungainly
so
much
as
big
very
big
now
quick
whispered
the
doctor
excited
in
english
this
time
i
find
out
sure
he
made
a
violent
movement
forward
a
pocket
electric
lamp
in
his
hand
then
turned
angrily
furiously
to
find
that
held
him
fast
there
was
a
most
unseemly
struggle
for
a
minute
and
it
was
caused
by
the
younger
man
sudden
passionate
instinct
to
protect
his
own
from
discovery
if
not
from
actual
capture
and
destruction
stahl
fought
in
vain
being
easily
overmatched
he
swore
vehement
german
oaths
under
his
breath
and
the
of
course
unlighted
fell
and
rattled
over
the
deck
sliding
with
the
gentle
roll
of
the
steamer
to
leeward
but
eyes
even
while
he
struggled
never
for
one
instant
left
the
spot
where
the
figure
and
the
movement
had
been
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
when
the
bulwarks
dipped
against
the
dark
of
the
sea
the
moving
thing
completed
its
efforts
and
passed
into
the
waves
with
a
swift
leap
when
the
vessel
righted
herself
again
the
outline
of
the
rail
was
clear
stahl
he
then
saw
had
picked
up
the
lamp
and
was
bending
over
some
mark
upon
the
deck
examining
a
wide
splash
of
wet
upon
which
he
directed
the
electric
flash
the
sense
of
revived
antagonism
between
the
men
for
the
moment
was
strong
too
strong
for
speech
feeling
half
ashamed
yet
realized
that
his
action
had
been
instinctive
and
that
another
time
he
would
do
just
the
same
he
would
fight
to
the
death
any
too
close
inspection
since
such
inspection
included
also
now
himself
the
doctor
presently
looked
up
his
eyes
shone
keenly
in
the
gleam
of
the
lamp
but
he
was
no
longer
agitated
there
is
too
much
water
he
said
calmly
as
though
diagnosing
a
case
too
much
to
permit
of
definite
traces
he
glanced
round
flashing
the
beam
about
the
decks
the
other
two
had
disappeared
they
were
alone
it
was
outside
the
rail
all
the
time
you
see
he
added
and
never
quite
reached
the
decks
he
stooped
down
and
examined
the
splash
once
more
it
looked
as
though
a
wave
had
topped
the
scuppers
and
left
a
running
line
of
foam
and
water
nothing
to
indicate
its
exact
nature
he
said
in
a
whisper
that
conveyed
something
between
uneasiness
and
awe
again
turning
the
light
sharply
in
every
direction
and
peering
about
him
it
came
to
them
er
from
the
sea
though
it
came
from
the
sea
right
enough
that
at
least
is
positive
and
in
his
manner
was
perhaps
just
a
touch
to
indicate
relief
and
it
returned
into
the
sea
exclaimed
triumphantly
it
was
as
though
he
related
his
own
escape
the
two
men
were
now
standing
upright
facing
one
another
stahl
betraying
no
sign
of
resentment
looked
him
steadily
in
the
eye
he
put
the
lamp
back
into
his
pocket
when
he
spoke
at
length
in
the
darkness
the
words
were
not
precisely
what
the
irishman
had
expected
under
them
his
own
vexation
and
excitement
faded
instantly
he
felt
almost
sheepish
when
he
remembered
his
violence
i
forgive
your
behavior
of
course
stahl
said
for
it
is
consistent
splendidly
consistent
with
my
theory
of
you
and
of
value
therefore
i
only
now
urge
you
again
he
moved
closer
speaking
almost
solemnly
to
accept
the
offer
of
a
berth
in
my
cabin
take
it
my
friend
take
it
tonight
because
you
wish
to
watch
me
at
close
quarters
no
was
the
reply
and
there
was
sympathy
in
the
voice
but
because
you
are
in
danger
especially
in
sleep
there
was
a
moment
pause
before
said
anything
it
is
kind
of
you
stahl
very
kind
he
answered
slowly
and
this
time
with
grave
politeness
but
i
am
not
afraid
and
i
see
no
reason
to
make
the
change
and
as
it
now
late
he
added
somewhat
abruptly
almost
as
though
he
feared
he
might
be
persuaded
to
alter
his
mind
i
will
say
and
turn
in
if
you
will
forgive
me
at
once
stahl
said
no
further
word
he
watched
him
the
other
was
aware
as
he
moved
down
the
deck
toward
the
saloon
staircase
and
then
turned
once
more
with
his
lamp
to
stoop
over
the
splashed
portion
of
the
boards
he
examined
the
place
apparently
for
a
long
time
but
as
he
went
slowly
down
the
hot
and
stuffy
stairs
realized
with
a
wild
and
rushing
tumult
of
joy
that
the
third
he
had
seen
was
of
a
splendor
surpassing
the
little
figures
of
men
and
that
something
deep
within
his
own
soul
was
most
gloriously
akin
with
it
a
link
with
the
universe
had
been
subconsciously
established
tightened
up
adjusted
from
all
this
living
nature
breathing
about
him
in
the
night
a
message
had
reached
the
strangers
and
himself
a
message
shaped
in
beauty
and
in
power
nature
had
become
at
last
aware
of
his
presence
close
against
her
ancient
face
henceforth
would
every
sight
of
beauty
take
him
direct
to
the
place
where
beauty
comes
from
no
middleman
no
art
was
necessary
the
gates
were
opening
already
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
xii
in
the
stateroom
he
found
without
surprise
somehow
that
his
new
companions
had
already
retired
for
the
night
the
curtain
of
the
upper
berth
was
drawn
and
on
the
below
the
opened
the
boy
already
slept
standing
a
moment
in
the
little
room
with
these
two
close
he
felt
that
he
had
come
into
a
new
existence
almost
deep
within
him
this
sense
of
new
life
thrilled
and
glowed
he
was
shaking
a
little
all
over
not
with
the
mere
tremor
of
excitement
however
but
with
the
tide
of
a
vast
and
rising
exultation
he
could
scarce
contain
for
his
normal
self
was
too
small
to
hold
it
it
demanded
expansion
and
the
expansion
it
claimed
had
already
begun
the
boundaries
of
his
personality
were
enormously
extending
in
words
this
change
escaped
him
wholly
he
only
knew
that
something
in
him
of
an
old
unrest
lay
down
at
length
and
slept
less
acute
grew
those
pangs
of
starvation
his
life
had
ever
felt
the
ache
of
that
inappeasable
hunger
for
the
beauty
and
innocence
of
some
primal
state
before
thick
human
crowds
had
stained
the
world
with
all
their
strife
and
clamor
the
glory
of
it
burned
white
within
him
and
the
way
he
described
it
to
himself
was
significant
of
its
true
nature
for
it
vans
the
analogy
of
childhood
the
passion
of
a
longing
swept
over
him
he
knew
again
the
feelings
of
those
early
days
when
a
boy
will
is
the
wind
will
and
the
thoughts
of
youth
are
long
long
thoughts
when
all
the
world
smells
sweet
and
golden
as
a
summer
day
and
a
village
street
is
endless
as
the
sky
this
it
was
raised
to
its
highest
power
that
dropped
a
hint
of
explanation
into
that
queer
heart
of
his
wherein
had
ever
burned
the
strange
desire
for
primitive
existence
it
was
the
call
though
not
of
his
own
youth
alone
but
of
the
youth
of
the
world
a
mood
of
the
consciousness
some
giant
expression
of
her
cosmic
emotion
caught
him
and
it
was
the
big
russian
who
acted
as
channel
and
interpreter
before
getting
into
bed
he
drew
aside
the
little
red
curtain
that
screened
his
companion
and
peered
cautiously
through
the
narrow
slit
the
big
occupant
of
the
bunk
also
slept
his
hair
spread
about
him
over
the
pillow
and
on
his
great
placid
face
a
look
of
peace
that
seemed
to
deepen
with
every
day
the
steamer
neared
her
destination
gazed
for
a
full
minute
and
more
then
the
sleeper
felt
the
gaze
for
suddenly
the
eyelids
quivered
moved
and
lifted
the
large
brown
eyes
peered
straight
into
his
own
the
irishman
unable
to
turn
away
in
time
stood
fixed
and
staring
in
return
the
gentleness
and
power
of
the
look
passed
straight
down
into
his
heart
filled
him
to
the
brim
with
things
their
owner
knew
and
confirmed
that
appeasement
of
his
own
hunger
already
begun
i
tried
to
prevent
the
interference
he
stammered
in
a
low
voice
i
held
him
back
you
saw
me
a
huge
hand
stretched
forth
from
the
bunk
to
stop
him
impulsively
he
seized
it
with
both
his
own
at
the
first
contact
he
started
a
little
frightened
it
felt
so
wonderful
so
mighty
thus
might
a
gust
of
wind
or
a
billow
of
the
sea
have
thrust
against
him
a
messenger
came
said
the
man
with
that
laborious
slow
utterance
and
deep
as
thunder
from
the
sea
from
the
sea
yes
repeated
beneath
his
breath
yet
conscious
rather
that
he
wanted
to
shout
and
sing
it
he
saw
the
big
man
smile
his
own
small
hands
were
crushed
in
the
grasp
of
power
i
understand
he
added
in
a
whisper
he
found
himself
speaking
with
a
similar
clogged
utterance
somehow
it
seemed
the
language
they
ought
to
have
used
was
either
forgotten
or
unborn
yet
whereas
his

himself
was

the
giant
half
rose
in
his
bed
as
though
at
first
to
leap
forward
and
away
from
it
he
tightened
an
instant
the
grasp
upon
his
hands
then
suddenly
released
them
and
pointed
across
the
cabin
that
smile
of
happiness
spread
upon
his
face
turned
there
the
boy
lay
deeply
slumbering
the
clothes
flung
back
so
that
the
air
from
the
played
over
the
bare
neck
and
chest
upon
his
face
too
shone
the
look
of
peace
and
rest
his
father
wore
the
hunted
expression
all
gone
as
though
the
spirit
had
escaped
in
sleep
the
parent
pointed
first
to
the
boy
then
to
himself
then
to
this
new
friend
standing
beside
his
bed
the
gesture
including
the
three
of
them
was
of
singular
authority
invitation
welcome
and
command
lay
in
it
more
in
some
incomprehensible
way
it
was
majestic
thought
flashed
upon
him
the
limb
of
some
great
oak
tree
swaying
in
the
wind
next
placing
a
finger
on
his
lips
his
eyes
once
more
swept
and
the
boy
and
he
turned
again
into
the
little
bunk
that
so
difficultly
held
him
and
lay
back
the
hair
flowed
down
and
mingled
with
the
beard
over
pillow
and
neck
almost
to
the
shoulders
and
something
that
was
enormous
and
magnificent
lay
back
with
him
carrying
with
it
again
that
sudden
atmosphere
of
greater
bulk
with
a
deep
sound
in
his
throat
that
was
certainly
no
actual
word
and
yet
more
expressive
than
any
speech
he
turned
hugely
over
among
the
little
scanty
sheets
drew
the
curtain
again
before
his
face
and
returned
into
the
world
of
sleep

but
rolled
into
his
own
berth
below
without
undressing
sleep
far
from
his
eyes
he
had
heard
the
gates
of
ivory
and
horn
swing
softly
upon
their
opening
hinges
and
the
glimpse
he
caught
of
the
garden
beyond
made
any
question
of
slumber
impossible
again
he
saw
those
shapes
of
cloud
and
wind
flying
over
the
long
hills
while
the
name
that
should
describe
them
ran
hauntingly
splendid
along
the
mysterious
passages
of
his
being
though
never
coming
quite
to
the
surface
for
capture
perhaps
too
he
was
glad
that
the
revelation
was
only
partial
the
size
of
the
vision
thus
invoked
awed
him
a
little
so
that
he
lay
there
half
wondering
at
the
complete
surrender
he
had
made
to
this
guidance
of
another
soul
stahl
warnings
ran
far
away
and
laughed
the
idea
even
came
to
him
that
stahl
was
playing
with
him
that
his
portentous
words
had
been
carefully
chosen
for
their
heightening
effect
upon
his
own
imagination
so
that
the
doctor
might
study
an
uncommon
and
extreme
case
the
notion
passed
through
him
merely
without
lingering
in
any
event
it
was
idle
to
put
the
brakes
on
now
he
was
internally
committed
and
must
go
wherever
it
might
lead
and
the
thought
rejoiced
him
he
had
climbed
upon
a
pendulum
that
swung
into
an
immense
past
but
its
return
swing
would
bring
him
safely
back
it
was
rushing
now
into
that
nameless
place
of
freedom
that
the
primitive
portion
of
his
being
had
hitherto
sought
in
vain
and
a
fundamental
starved
craving
of
his
life
would
know
satisfaction
at
last
already
life
had
grown
all
glorious
without
it
was
not
steel
engines
but
a
speeding
sense
of
beauty
that
drove
the
ship
over
the
sea
with
feet
of
winged
blue
darkness
the
stars
fled
with
them
across
the
sky
dropping
golden
leashes
to
draw
him
faster
and
faster
forwards
yet
within
to
the
dim
days
when
this
old
world
yet
was
young
he
took
his
fire
of
youth
and
spread
it
as
it
were
all
over
life
till
it
covered
the
entire
world
far
far
away
then
he
stepped
back
into
it
and
the
world
herself
he
found
stepped
with
him
he
lay
listening
to
the
noises
of
the
ship
the
thump
and
bumble
of
the
engines
the
distant
droning
of
the
screws
under
water
from
time
to
time
stewards
moved
down
the
corridor
outside
and
the
footsteps
of
some
late
passenger
still
paced
the
decks
overhead
he
heard
voices
too
and
occasionally
the
clattering
of
doors
once
or
twice
he
fancied
some
one
moved
stealthily
to
the
cabin
door
and
lingered
there
but
the
matter
never
drew
him
to
investigate
for
the
sound
each
time
resolved
itself
naturally
into
the
music
of
the
ship
noises
and
everything
meanwhile
heard
or
thought
fed
the
central
concern
upon
which
his
mind
was
busy
these
superficial
sounds
for
instance
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
real
business
of
the
ship
lay
below
with
the
buried
engines
and
the
invisible
screws
that
worked
like
demons
to
bring
her
into
port
and
with
himself
and
his
slumbering
companions
the
case
was
similar
their
respective
working
in
the
subconscious
had
urged
them
toward
one
another
inevitably
how
long
he
wondered
had
the
spirit
of
that
lonely
alien
being
flashed
messages
into
the
void
that
reached
no
tuned
to
their
acceptance
their
accumulated
power
was
great
the
currents
they
generated
immense
he
knew
for
had
they
not
charged
full
into
himself
the
instant
he
came
on
board
bringing
an
intimacy
that
was
immediate
and
the
untamed
longings
that
always
tore
him
when
he
felt
the
great
winds
moved
through
forests
or
found
himself
in
desolate
places
were
at
last
on
the
high
road
to
satisfaction
to
some
state
where
all
that
they
represented
would
be
explained
and
fulfilled
and
whether
such
state
should
prove
to
be
upon
the
solid
surface
of
the
earth
objective
or
in
the
fluid
regions
of
his
inner
being
subjective
was
of
no
account
whatever
it
would
be
true
the
great
figure
that
filled
the
berth
above
him
now
deeply
slumbering
had
in
him
subterraneans
that
gave
access
not
only
to
greece
but
far
beyond
that
haunted
land
to
a
state
of
existence
symbolized
in
the
legends
of
the
early
world
by
eden
and
the
golden
age
you
are
in
danger
that
wise
old
speculative
doctor
had
whispered
and
especially
in
sleep
but
he
did
not
sleep
he
lay
there
thinking
thinking
thinking
a
rising
exaltation
of
desire
paving
busily
the
path
along
which
eventually
he
might
escape
as
the
night
advanced
and
the
lesser
noises
retired
leaving
only
the
deep
sound
of
the
steamer
talking
to
the
sea
he
became
aware
too
that
a
change
at
first
imperceptibly
then
swiftly
was
stealing
over
the
cabin
it
came
with
a
riot
of
silent
beauty
at
a
loss
to
describe
it
with
precision
he
nevertheless
divined
that
it
proceeded
from
the
sleeping
figure
overhead
and
in
a
lesser
pleasure
too
from
the
boy
upon
the
sofa
opposite
it
emanated
from
these
two
he
felt
in
proportion
as
their
bodies
passed
into
deeper
and
deeper
slumber
as
though
what
occurred
sometimes
upon
the
decks
by
an
act
of
direct
volition
took
place
now
automatically
and
with
a
fuller
measure
of
release
their
spirits
free
of
that
other
world
in
sleep
were
alert
and
potently
discharging
unconsciously
their
vital
underlying
essence
escaped
into
activity
growing
about
his
own
person
next
it
softly
folded
him
in
casing
his
inner
being
with
glory
and
this
crowding
sense
of
beauty
this
increased
manifestation
of
psychic
activity
reached
down
into
the
very
core
of
himself
like
invisible
fingers
playing
upon
an
instrument
notes
powers
in
his
soul
hitherto
silent
because
none
had
known
how
to
sound
them
rose
singing
to
the
surface
for
it
seemed
at
length
that
forms
of
some
intenser
life
busily
operating
moved
to
and
fro
within
the
painted
white
walls
of
that
little
cabin
working
subtly
to
bring
about
a
transformation
of
himself
a
singular
change
was
fast
and
cleverly
at
work
in
his
own
being
it
was
he
puts
it
a
silent
and
irresistible
evocation
no
one
of
his
senses
was
directly
affected
certainly
he
neither
saw
felt
nor
heard
anything
in
the
usual
acceptance
of
the
terms
but
any
instant
surely
it
seemed
that
all
his
senses
must
awake
and
report
to
the
mind
things
that
were
splendid
beyond
the
common
order
in
the
crudest
aspect
of
it
he
felt
as
though
he
extended
and
grew
large
that
he
dreaded
to
see
himself
in
the
mirror
lest
he
might
witness
an
external
appearance
of
bigness
which
corresponded
to
this
interior
expansion
for
a
long
time
he
lay
unresisting
letting
the
currents
of
this
subjective
tempest
play
through
and
round
him
entrancing
sensations
of
beauty
and
rapture
came
with
it
the
outer
world
seemed
remote
and
trivial
the
passengers
unreal
the
priest
the
voluble
merchant
the
jovial
captain
all
spun
like
dead
things
at
the
periphery
of
life
whereas
he
was
moving
toward
the
center
stahl
the
thought
of
stahl
alone
intruded
with
a
certain
unwelcome
air
of
hindrance
almost
as
though
he
sought
to
end
it
or
call
a
halt
but
stahl
too
himself
presently
spun
off
like
a
leaf
before
the
rising
wind
and
then
it
was
that
an
external
sense
was
tapped
and
he
did
hear
something
from
the
berth
overhead
came
a
faint
sound
that
made
his
heart
stand
still
though
not
with
common
fear
he
listened
intently
the
blood
tearing
through
his
ears
at
first
concealed
its
actual
nature
it
was
far
far
away
then
came
closer
as
a
waft
of
wind
brings
near
and
carries
off
again
a
sound
of
bells
in
mountains
it
fled
over
vales
and
hills
to
return
a
moment
after
with
suddenness
a
little
louder
a
little
nearer
and
with
it
came
an
increase
of
this
sense
of
beauty
that
stretched
his
heart
as
it
were
to
some
deep
ancient
scale
of
joy
once
known
but
long
forgotten
across
the
cabin
the
boy
moved
uneasily
in
his
sleep
oh
that
i
could
be
with
him
where
he
now
is
he
cried
in
that
place
of
eternal
youth
and
eternal
companionship
the
cry
was
instinctive
utterly
his
whole
being
condensed
in
the
single
yearning
pressed
through
it
drove
behind
it
the
place
the
companionship
the
youth
all
he
knew
would
prove
in
some
strange
way
enormous
vast
ultimately
satisfying
forever
and
ever
far
out
of
this
little
modern
world
that
imprisoned
him
again
most
unwelcome
and
unexplained
the
face
of
stahl
flashed
suddenly
before
him
to
hinder
and
interrupt
he
banished
it
with
an
effort
for
it
brought
a
smaller
comprehension
that
somehow
involved
fear
curse
the
man
flamed
in
anger
across
his
world
of
beauty
and
the
violence
of
the
contrast
broke
something
in
his
mind
like
a
globe
of
colored
glass
that
had
focused
the
exquisiteness
of
the
vision
the
sound
continued
as
before
but
its
power
of
evocation
lessened
the
thought
of
stahl
stahl
in
his
denying
aspect
dimmed
it
glancing
up
at
the
frosted
electric
light
felt
vaguely
that
if
he
turned
it
out
he
would
somehow
yet
see
better
hear
better
understand
more
and
it
was
this
practical
consideration
introduced
indirectly
by
the
thought
of
stahl
that
made
him
realize
now
for
the
first
time
that
he
actually
and
definitely
was
afraid
for
to
leave
his
bunk
with
its
comparative
protective
dark
and
step
into
the
middle
of
a
cabin
he
knew
to
be
alive
with
a
seethe
of
invisible
charging
forces
made
him
realize
that
distinct
effort
was
necessary
effort
of
will
if
he
yielded
he
would
be
caught
up
and
away
swept
from
his
known
moorings
borne
through
high
space
out
of
himself
and
stahl
with
his
cowardly
warnings
and
belittlements
set
fear
thus
in
the
place
of
free
acceptance
otherwise
he
might
even
have
come
to
these
long
blue
hills
where
danced
and
raced
the
giant
shapes
of
cloud
singing
while
singing
ah
there
was
the
clue
the
sound
he
heard
was
singing
faint
low
singing
close
beside
him
too
it
was
the
big
man
singing
softly
in
his
sleep
this
ordinary
explanation
of
the
brought
him
down
to
earth
and
so
to
a
more
normal
feeling
of
security
again
he
stepped
cautiously
from
the
bed
careful
not
to
let
the
rings
rattle
on
the
rod
of
brass
and
slowly
raised
himself
upright
and
then
through
a
slit
of
the
curtain
he
saw
the
lips
of
the
big
sleeper
moved
gently
the
beard
rising
and
falling
very
slightly
with
them
and
this
murmur
that
he
had
thought
so
far
away
came
out
and
sang
deliriously
and
faint
before
his
very
face
it
most
curiously
flowed
easily
naturally
almost
automatically
it
poured
softly
forth
and
the
irishman
at
once
understood
why
he
had
first
mistaken
it
for
an
echo
of
wind
from
distant
hills
the
imagery
was
entirely
accurate
for
it
was
precisely
the
singing
cry
that
wind
makes
in
a
keyhole
in
a
chimney
or
passing
idly
over
the
sweep
of
grassy
hills
exactly
thus
had
he
often
listened
to
it
swishing
through
the
crannies
of
high
rocks
tuneless
yet
searching
in
it
too
there
lay
some
accent
of
a
secret
dim
sublimity
deeper
far
than
any
other
human
sound
could
touch
the
terror
of
a
great
freedom
caught
him
a
freedom
most
awfully
remote
from
the
smaller
personal
existence
he
knew
today
for
it
suggested
with
awe
and
wonder
the
kind
of
primitive
utterance
that
was
before
speech
or
the
development
of
language
when
emotions
were
still
too
vague
and
mighty
to
be
caught
by
little
words
but
when
beings
close
to
the
heart
of
their
great
mother
expressed
the
feelings
enormous
and
uncomplex
of
the
greater
life
they
shared
as
portions
of
her
projections
of
the
earth
herself
with
a
crash
in
his
brain
stopped
these
thoughts
he
suddenly
realized
were
not
his
own
an
attack
of
unwonted
sensations
stung
and
scattered
his
mind
with
a
rush
of
giant
splendor
that
threatened
to
overwhelm
him
he
was
in
the
very
act
of
being
carried
away
his
sense
of
personal
identity
menaced
surrender
already
complete
another
moment
especially
if
those
eyes
opened
and
caught
him
and
he
would
be
beyond
recall
in
the
region
of
these
other
two
the
narrow
space
of
that
little
cabin
was
charged
already
to
the
brim
filled
with
some
overpowering
loveliness
of
wild
and
simple
things
the
beauty
of
stars
and
winds
and
flowers
the
terror
of
seas
and
mountains
strange
radiant
forms
of
gods
and
heroes
nymphs
fauns
and
satyrs
the
fierce
sunshine
of
some
golden
age
unspoiled
of
a
stainless
region
now
long
forgotten
and
denied
that
world
of
splendor
his
heart
had
ever
craved
in
vain
and
beside
which
the
life
of
today
faded
to
a
wretched
dream
it
was
the
calling
with
a
violent
internal
effort
he
tore
his
gaze
from
those
eyelids
that
fortunately
opened
not
at
the
same
moment
though
he
did
not
hear
them
steps
came
close
in
the
corridor
and
there
was
a
rattling
of
the
knob
behind
him
a
movement
from
the
berth
below
the
warned
him
that
he
was
but
just
in
time
the
vision
he
was
afraid
as
yet
to
acknowledge
drew
with
such
awful
speed
toward
the
climax
quickly
he
turned
away
lifted
the
hook
of
the
cabin
door
and
passed
into
the
passage
strangely
faint
a
great
commotion
followed
him
out
father
and
son
both
it
seemed
suddenly
upon
their
feet
and
at
the
same
time
the
sound
of
singing
rolled
into
the
body
of
a
great
hushed
chorus
as
it
were
of
galloping
winds
that
filled
big
valleys
far
away
with
a
gust
of
splendor
faintly
roaring
in
some
incredible
distance
where
no
cities
were
nor
habitations
of
men
with
a
freedom
too
that
was
majestic
and
sublime
oh
the
terrific
gait
of
that
life
in
an
open
world
golden
to
the
winds
uncrowded
the
cosmic
life
shivered
as
he
heard
for
an
instant
the
true
grain
of
his
inner
life
picked
out
in
flame
and
silver
flashed
clear
almost
he
knew
himself
caught
back
and
there
in
the
corridor
against
the
paneling
of
the
cabin
wall
crouched
stahl
listening
the
pain
of
the
contrast
was
vivid
beyond
words
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
passed
from
the
thunder
of
organs
to
hear
the
rattling
of
tin
cans
instantly
he
understood
the
force
that
all
along
had
held
him
back
the
positive
denying
aspect
of
this
man
mind
afraid
he
exclaimed
in
a
high
whisper
what
are
doing
here
he
hardly
remembers
what
he
said
the
doctor
straightened
up
and
came
on
tiptoe
to
his
side
he
moved
hurriedly
come
away
he
said
vehemently
under
his
breath
come
with
me
to
my
cabin
to
the
decks
anywhere
away
from
this
before
it
too
late
and
the
irishman
then
realized
that
his
face
was
white
and
that
his
voice
shook
the
hand
that
gripped
him
by
the
arm
shook
too
they
went
quickly
along
the
deserted
corridor
and
up
the
stairs
making
no
resistance
moving
in
a
kind
of
dream
he
has
a
fleeting
recollection
of
an
odor
sweet
and
slightly
pungent
as
of
horses
in
his
nostrils
the
wind
of
the
open
decks
revived
him
and
he
saw
to
his
amazement
that
the
east
was
brightening
in
that
cabin
then
hours
had
been
compressed
into
minutes
the
steamer
had
already
slipped
by
the
straits
of
messina
to
the
right
he
saw
the
cones
of
etna
shadowy
in
the
sky
calling
across
the
dawn
to
stromboli
their
smoking
brother
of
the
lipari
to
the
left
over
the
blue
ionian
sea
the
lights
of
a
cloudless
sunrise
rose
softly
above
the
world
and
the
hour
of
enchantment
seized
and
shook
him
anew
somewhere
across
those
faint
blue
waves
lay
the
things
that
he
so
passionately
sought
it
was
the
very
essence
of
their
loveliness
and
wonder
that
had
charged
down
between
the
walls
of
that
stuffy
cabin
below
for
every
morning
still
at
dawn
the
tired
world
knows
again
the
splendors
of
her
youth
and
the
irishman
shuddering
a
little
in
his
sacred
joy
felt
that
he
must
burst
his
bonds
and
fly
to
join
the
sunrise
and
the
sea
the
yearning
he
was
aware
had
now
increased
a
thousandfold
its
fulfillment
was
merely
delayed
he
passed
along
the
decks
all
slippery
with
dew
into
stahl
cabin
and
flung
himself
on
the
broad
sofa
to
sleep
sleep
too
came
at
once
he
was
profoundly
exhausted
and
while
he
slept
stahl
watched
over
him
covering
his
body
with
a
thick
blanket
xiv
it
is
a
lovely
imagination
responding
to
the
deepest
desires
instincts
cravings
of
spiritual
man
that
spiritual
rapture
should
find
an
echo
in
the
material
world
that
in
mental
communion
with
god
we
should
find
sensible
communion
with
nature
and
that
when
the
faithful
rejoice
together
bird
and
beast
hill
and
forest
should
be
not
felt
only
but
seen
to
rejoice
along
with
them
it
is
not
the
truth
between
us
and
our
environment
whatever
links
there
are
this
link
is
wanting
but
the
yearning
for
it
the
passion
which
made
wordsworth
cry
out
for
something
even
were
it
the
imagination
of
a
pagan
which
would
make
him
forlorn
is
natural
to
man
and
simplicity
leaps
at
the
lovely
fiction
of
a
response
just
here
is
the
opportunity
for
such
alliances
between
spiritualism
and
superstition
as
are
the
daily
despair
of
seekers
after
truth
verrall
and
though
he
slept
for
hours
the
doctor
never
once
left
his
side
but
sat
there
with
pencil
and
notebook
striving
to
catch
yet
in
vain
some
accurate
record
of
the
strange
fragmentary
words
that
fell
from
his
lips
at
intervals
his
own
face
was
aflame
with
an
interest
that
amounted
to
excitement
the
very
hand
that
held
the
pencil
trembled
one
would
have
said
that
thus
somewhat
a
man
might
behave
who
found
himself
faced
with
confirmation
of
some
vast
speculative
theory
his
mind
had
played
with
hitherto
from
a
distance
only
toward
noon
the
irishman
awoke
the
steamer
still
loading
oranges
and
sacks
of
sulfur
in
the
catania
harbor
was
dusty
and
noisy
most
of
the
passengers
were
ashore
hurrying
with
guidebooks
and
to
see
the
statue
of
the
dead
bellini
or
watch
the
lava
flow
a
blazing
suffocating
heat
lay
over
the
oily
sea
and
the
summit
of
the
volcano
with
its
tiny
puff
of
smoke
soared
through
blue
haze
to
stahl
remark
you
slept
eight
hours
he
replied
but
i
feel
as
though
i
slept
eight
centuries
away
he
took
the
coffee
and
rolls
provided
and
then
smoked
the
doctor
lit
a
cigar
the
red
curtains
over
the
shut
out
the
fierce
sun
leaving
the
cabin
cool
and
dim
the
shouting
of
the
lightermen
and
officers
mingled
with
the
roar
and
scuttle
of
the
and
knew
perfectly
well
that
while
the
other
moved
about
carelessly
playing
with
books
and
papers
on
his
desk
he
was
all
the
time
keeping
him
under
close
observation
yes
he
continued
half
to
himself
i
feel
as
if
i
fallen
asleep
in
one
world
and
awakened
into
another
where
life
is
trivial
and
insignificant
where
men
work
like
devils
for
things
of
no
value
in
order
to
accumulate
them
in
great
ugly
houses
always
collecting
and
collecting
like
mad
children
possessions
that
they
never
really
possess
things
external
to
themselves
valueless
and
unreal
stahl
came
up
quietly
and
sat
down
beside
him
he
spoke
gently
his
manner
kind
and
grave
rather
he
put
a
hand
upon
his
shoulder
but
my
dear
boy
he
said
the
critical
mood
all
melted
away
do
not
let
yourself
go
too
completely
that
is
vicious
thinking
believe
me
all
details
are
important
here
and
now
spiritually
important
if
you
prefer
the
term
the
symbols
change
with
the
ages
that
is
all
then
as
the
other
did
not
reply
he
added
keep
yourself
well
in
hand
your
experience
is
of
extraordinary
interest
may
even
be
of
value
to
yourself
as
well
as
to
er
others
and
what
happened
to
you
last
night
is
worthy
of
record
if
you
can
use
it
without
surrendering
your
soul
to
it
altogether
perhaps
later
you
will
feel
able
to
speak
of
it
to
tell
me
in
detail
a
little
his
keen
desire
to
know
more
evidently
fought
with
his
desire
to
protect
to
heal
possibly
even
to
prevent
if
i
felt
sure
that
your
control
were
sufficient
i
could
tell
you
in
return
some
results
of
my
own
study
of
certain
cases
in
the
hospitals
you
see
that
might
throw
light
upon
upon
your
own
curious
experience
turned
with
such
abruptness
that
the
cigar
ash
fell
down
over
his
clothes
the
bait
was
strong
but
the
man
sympathy
was
not
sufficiently
of
a
piece
he
felt
to
win
his
entire
confidence
i
can
not
discuss
beliefs
he
said
shortly
in
the
speculative
way
you
do
they
are
too
real
a
man
does
argue
about
his
love
does
he
he
spoke
passionately
today
everybody
argues
discusses
speculates
no
one
believes
if
you
had
your
way
you
take
away
my
beliefs
and
put
in
their
place
some
wretched
little
formula
of
science
that
the
next
generation
will
prove
all
wrong
again
it
like
the
n
rays
one
of
you
discovered
they
never
really
existed
at
all
he
laughed
then
his
flushed
face
turned
grave
again
beliefs
are
deeper
than
discoveries
they
are
eternal
stahl
looked
at
him
a
moment
with
admiration
he
moved
across
the
cabin
toward
his
desk
i
am
more
with
you
than
perhaps
you
understand
he
said
quietly
yet
without
too
obviously
humoring
him
i
am
more
divided
that
all
modern
exclaimed
the
other
noticing
the
ashes
on
his
coat
for
the
first
time
and
brushing
them
off
impatiently
everything
in
you
expresses
itself
in
terms
of
matter
forgetting
that
matter
being
in
continual
state
of
flux
is
the
least
real
of
all
things
our
training
has
been
different
observed
stahl
simply
interrupting
him
i
use
another
phraseology
fundamentally
we
are
not
so
far
apart
as
you
think
our
conversation
of
yesterday
proves
it
if
you
have
not
forgotten
it
is
people
like
yourself
who
supply
the
material
that
teaches
people
like
me
helps
me
to
advance
to
speculate
though
you
dislike
the
term
the
irishman
was
mollified
though
for
some
time
he
continued
in
the
same
strain
and
the
doctor
let
him
talk
realizing
that
his
emotion
needed
the
relief
of
this
he
used
words
loosely
but
stahl
did
not
check
him
it
was
merely
that
the
effort
to
express
himself
this
self
that
could
believe
so
much
found
difficulty
in
doing
so
coherently
in
modern
language
he
went
very
far
for
the
fact
that
while
stahl
criticized
and
denied
he
yet
understood
was
a
strong
incentive
to
talk
plunged
repeatedly
over
his
depth
and
each
time
the
doctor
helped
him
in
to
shore
perhaps
said
stahl
at
length
in
a
pause
the
greatest
difference
between
us
is
merely
that
whereas
you
jump
headlong
ignoring
details
by
the
way
i
climb
slowly
counting
the
steps
and
making
them
secure
i
deny
at
first
because
if
the
steps
survive
such
denial
i
know
that
they
are
permanent
i
build
scaffolding
you
fly
flight
is
quicker
put
in
the
irishman
it
is
for
the
few
was
the
reply
scaffolding
is
for
all
you
spoke
a
few
days
ago
of
strange
things
said
presently
with
abruptness
and
spoke
seriously
too
tell
me
more
about
that
if
you
will
he
sought
to
lead
the
talk
away
from
himself
since
he
did
not
intend
to
be
fully
drawn
you
said
something
about
the
theory
that
the
earth
is
alive
a
living
being
and
that
the
early
legendary
forms
of
life
may
have
been
emanations
projections
of
herself
detached
portions
of
her
consciousness
or
something
of
the
sort
tell
me
about
that
theory
can
there
be
really
men
who
are
thus
children
of
the
earth
fruit
of
pure
passion
cosmic
beings
as
you
hinted
it
interests
me
deeply
stahl
appeared
to
hesitate
it
is
not
new
to
me
of
course
pursued
the
other
but
i
should
like
to
know
more
stahl
still
seemed
irresolute
it
is
true
he
replied
at
length
slowly
that
in
an
unguarded
moment
i
let
drop
certain
observations
it
is
better
you
should
consider
them
unsaid
perhaps
forget
them
and
why
pray
the
answer
was
well
calculated
to
whet
his
appetite
because
answered
the
doctor
bending
over
to
him
as
he
crossed
over
to
his
side
they
are
dangerous
thoughts
to
play
with
dangerous
to
the
interests
of
humanity
in
its
present
state
today
unsettling
to
the
soul
shaking
the
foundations
of
sane
consciousness
he
looked
hard
at
him
your
own
mind
he
added
softly
appears
to
me
to
be
already
on
their
track
whether
you
are
aware
of
it
or
not
you
have
in
you
that
kind
of
very
passionate
desire
of
yearning
which
might
reconstruct
them
and
make
them
come
true
for
yourself
if
you
get
out
his
eyes
shining
looked
up
into
his
face
make
them
come
true
if
i
get
out
he
repeated
stammeringly
fearful
that
if
he
appeared
too
eager
the
other
would
stop
you
mean
of
course
that
this
double
in
me
would
escape
and
build
its
own
heaven
stahl
nodded
darkly
driven
forth
by
your
intense
desire
after
a
pause
he
added
the
process
already
begun
in
you
would
complete
itself
ah
so
obviously
what
the
doctor
wanted
was
a
description
of
his
sensations
in
that
haunted
cabin
temporarily
asked
the
irishman
under
his
breath
the
other
did
not
answer
for
a
moment
repeated
the
question
temporarily
said
stahl
turning
away
again
toward
his
desk
unless
the
yearning
were
too
strong
in
which
case
permanently
for
it
would
draw
the
entire
personality
with
it
the
soul
stahl
was
bending
over
his
books
and
papers
the
answer
was
barely
audible
death
was
the
whispered
word
that
floated
across
the
heavy
air
of
that
little
cabin
the
word
if
spoken
at
all
was
so
softly
spoken
that
the
irishman
scarcely
knew
whether
he
actually
heard
it
or
whether
it
was
uttered
by
his
own
thought
he
only
realized
catching
some
vivid
current
from
the
other
man
mind
that
this
separation
of
a
vital
portion
of
himself
that
stahl
hinted
at
might
involve
a
kind
of
nameless
inner
catastrophe
which
should
mean
the
loss
of
his
personality
as
it
existed
today
an
idea
however
that
held
no
terror
for
him
if
it
meant
at
the
same
time
the
recovery
of
what
he
so
passionately
sought
and
another
intuition
flashed
upon
its
heels
namely
that
this
extraordinary
doctor
spoke
of
something
he
knew
as
a
certainty
that
his
amazing
belief
though
paraded
as
theory
was
to
him
more
than
theory
had
he
himself
undergone
some
experience
that
he
dared
not
speak
of
and
were
his
words
based
upon
a
personal
experience
instead
of
as
he
pretended
merely
upon
the
observation
of
others
was
this
a
result
of
his
study
of
the
big
man
two
years
ago
was
this
the
true
explanation
of
his
being
no
longer
an
assistant
at
the
h
hospital
but
only
a
ship
doctor
had
this
modern
man
after
all
a
flaming
volcano
of
ancient
and
splendid
belief
in
him
akin
to
what
was
in
himself
yet
ever
fighting
it
thoughts
raced
and
thundered
through
his
mind
as
he
watched
him
across
the
cigar
smoke
the
rattling
of
that
the
shouts
of
the
lightermen
the
thuds
of
the
how
ridiculous
they
all
sounded
the
clatter
of
a
futile
meaningless
existence
where
men
gathered
rubbish
for
mere
bodies
that
lived
amid
dust
a
few
years
then
returned
to
dust
forever
he
sprang
from
his
sofa
and
crossed
over
to
the
doctor
side
stahl
was
still
bending
over
a
littered
desk
you
too
he
cried
and
though
trying
to
say
it
loud
his
voice
could
only
whisper
you
too
must
have
the
in
your
heart
and
blood
for
how
else
by
my
soul
could
you
it
all
tell
me
doctor
tell
me
and
he
was
on
the
very
verge
of
adding
join
us
come
and
join
us
when
the
little
german
turned
his
bald
head
slowly
round
and
fixed
upon
the
excited
irishman
such
a
cool
and
quenching
stare
that
instantly
he
felt
himself
convicted
of
foolishness
almost
of
impertinence
he
dropped
backwards
into
an
armchair
and
the
doctor
at
the
same
moment
let
himself
down
upon
the
revolving
stool
that
was
nailed
to
the
floor
in
front
of
the
desk
his
hands
smoothed
out
papers
then
he
leaned
forward
still
holding
his
companion
eyes
with
that
steady
stare
which
forbade
familiarity
my
friend
he
said
quietly
in
german
you
asked
me
just
now
to
tell
you
of
the
theory
fechner
theory
that
the
earth
is
a
living
conscious
being
if
you
care
to
listen
i
will
do
so
we
have
time
he
glanced
round
at
the
shady
cabin
took
down
a
book
from
the
shelf
before
him
puffed
his
black
cigar
and
began
to
read
it
is
from
one
of
your
own
people
william
james
what
you
call
a
lecture
at
manchester
college
it
gives
you
an
idea
at
least
of
what
fechner
saw
it
is
better
than
my
own
words
so
stahl
in
his
turn
refused
to
be
drawn
as
soon
as
he
recovered
from
the
abruptness
of
the
change
from
that
other
conversation
gave
all
his
attention
the
uneasy
feeling
that
he
was
being
played
with
coaxed
as
a
specimen
to
the
best
possible
point
for
the
microscope
passed
away
as
the
splendor
of
the
vast
and
beautiful
conception
dawned
upon
him
and
shaped
those
nameless
yearnings
of
his
life
in
glowing
language
xv
the
shadows
of
the
september
afternoon
were
lengthening
toward
us
from
the
round
pond
by
the
time
reached
this
stage
of
his
curious
and
fascinating
story
it
was
chilly
under
the
trees
and
the
babies
as
he
termed
them
had
long
since
gone
in
to
their
teas
or
whatever
it
is
that
london
babies
take
at
six
we
strolled
home
together
and
he
welcomed
the
idea
of
sharing
a
dinner
we
should
cook
ourselves
in
the
tiny
knightsbridge
flat
stewpot
evenings
he
called
these
occasions
they
reminded
us
of
camping
trips
together
although
it
must
be
confessed
that
in
the
room
the
stew
never
tasted
quite
as
it
did
beside
running
water
on
the
skirts
of
the
forest
when
the
dews
were
gathering
on
the
little
gleaming
tent
and
the
mingled
with
the
scents
of
earth
and
leaves
passing
that
grotesque
erection
opposite
the
albert
hall
gaudy
in
the
last
touch
of
sunset
i
saw
him
shudder
the
spell
of
the
ship
and
sea
and
the
blazing
sicilian
sunshine
lay
still
upon
us
etna
cones
towering
beyond
those
gilded
spikes
of
the
tawdry
memorial
i
stole
a
glance
at
my
companion
his
light
blue
eyes
shone
but
with
the
reflection
of
another
sunset
the
sunset
of
forgotten
ancient
scenes
when
the
world
was
young
his
personality
held
something
of
magic
in
that
silent
stroll
homewards
for
no
word
fell
from
either
one
of
us
to
break
its
charm
the
untidy
hair
escaped
from
beneath
the
old
hat
and
his
faded
coat
of
grey
flannel
seemed
touched
with
the
shadows
that
the
dusk
brings
beneath
trees
i
noticed
the
set
of
his
ears
and
how
the
upper
points
of
them
ran
so
sharply
into
the
hair
his
walk
was
springy
light
very
quiet
suggesting
that
he
moved
on
open
turf
where
a
sudden
running
jump
would
land
him
not
into
a
but
into
a
mossy
covert
where
ferns
grew
there
was
a
certain
fling
of
the
shoulders
that
had
an
air
of
rejecting
streets
and
houses
some
fancy
wild
and
sweet
caught
me
of
a
faun
passing
down
through
underbrush
of
woodland
glades
to
drink
at
a
forest
pool
and
chance
giving
back
to
me
a
little
verse
of
alice
corbin
i
turned
and
murmured
it
while
watching
him
what
dim
arcadian
pastures
have
i
known
that
suddenly
out
of
nothing
a
wind
is
blown
lifting
a
veil
and
a
darkness
showing
a
purple
sea
and
under
your
hair
the
faun
eyes
look
out
on
me
it
was
of
course
that
whereas
his
body
marched
along
hill
street
and
through
montpelier
square
his
thoughts
and
spirit
flitted
through
the
haunted
garden
he
forever
craved
i
thought
of
the
morrow
of
my
desk
in
the
life
insurance
office
of
the
clerks
with
oiled
hair
brushed
back
from
the
forehead
all
exactly
alike
trousers
neatly
turned
up
to
show
fancy
colored
socks
from
bargain
sales
their
pockets
full
of
cheap
cigarettes
their
minds
busy
with
painted
actresses
and
the
names
of
horses
a
life
insurance
office
all
london
paying
yearly
sums
to
protect
themselves
against
against
the
most
interesting
moment
of
life
premiums
upon
escape
and
freedom
again
it
was
the
spell
of
my
companion
personality
that
turned
all
this
paraphernalia
of
the
busy
modern
existence
into
the
counters
in
some
grotesque
and
rather
sordid
game
tomorrow
of
course
it
would
all
turn
real
and
earnest
again
story
a
mere
poetic
fancy
but
for
the
moment
i
lived
it
with
him
and
found
it
magnificent
and
the
talk
we
had
that
evening
when
the
was
empty
and
we
were
smoking
on
the
roof
of
the
for
he
always
begged
for
open
air
and
with
cushions
we
often
sat
beneath
the
stars
and
against
the
grimy
that
talk
i
shall
never
forget
life
became
constructed
all
anew
the
power
of
the
greatest
fairy
tale
this
world
can
ever
know
lay
about
me
raised
to
its
highest
expression
i
caught
at
least
some
touch
of
reality
of
awful
reality
in
the
idea
that
this
splendid
globe
whereon
we
perched
like
insects
peeping
timidly
from
tiny
cells
might
be
the
body
of
a
glorious
being
the
mighty
frame
to
which
some
immense
collective
consciousness
vaster
than
that
of
men
and
wholly
different
in
kind
might
be
attached
in
the
story
as
i
found
it
later
in
the
dusty
little
paddington
room
reported
somewhat
heavily
it
seemed
to
me
the
excerpts
chosen
by
stahl
as
an
imaginative
essay
they
were
interesting
of
course
and
vitally
suggestive
but
in
a
tale
of
adventure
such
as
this
they
overweight
the
barque
of
fancy
yet
in
order
to
appreciate
what
followed
it
seems
necessary
for
the
mind
to
steep
itself
in
something
of
his
ideas
the
reader
who
dreads
to
think
and
likes
his
imagination
to
soar
unsupported
may
perhaps
dispense
with
the
balance
of
this
section
but
to
be
faithful
to
the
scaffolding
whereon
this
irishman
built
his
amazing
dream
i
must
attempt
as
best
i
can
some
précis
of
that
conversation
xvi
every
fragment
of
visible
nature
might
as
far
as
is
known
serve
as
part
in
some
organism
unlike
our
bodies
as
to
that
which
can
and
that
which
can
not
play
the
part
of
an
organism
we
know
very
little
a
sameness
greater
or
less
with
our
own
bodies
is
the
basis
from
which
we
conclude
to
other
bodies
and
souls
a
certain
likeness
of
outward
form
and
again
some
amount
of
similarity
in
action
are
what
we
stand
on
when
we
argue
to
psychical
life
but
our
failure
on
the
other
side
to
discover
these
symptoms
is
no
sufficient
warrant
for
positive
denial
it
is
natural
in
this
connection
to
refer
to
fechner
vigorous
advocacy
bradley
and
it
was
with
an
innate
resistance
at
least
a
stubborn
prejudice
that
i
heard
him
begin
the
earth
of
course
was
but
a
bubble
of
dried
fire
a
huge
round
clod
dead
as
mutton
how
could
it
be
in
any
permissible
sense
of
the
word
alive
then
gradually
as
he
talked
there
among
the
of
old
smoky
london
there
stole
over
me
this
new
and
disquieting
sense
of
reality
a
strange
vast
splendor
too
mighty
to
lie
in
the
mind
with
comfort
laughter
fled
away
ashamed
a
new
beauty
as
of
some
amazing
dawn
flashed
and
broke
upon
the
world
the
autumn
sky
overhead
with
its
myriad
stars
came
down
close
sifting
gold
and
fire
about
my
life
dull
ways
that
desk
in
the
insurance
office
of
cornhill
gleamed
beyond
as
an
altar
or
a
possible
throne
the
glory
of
fechner
immense
speculation
flamed
about
us
both
majestic
yet
divinely
simple
only
a
dim
suggestion
of
it
of
course
lay
caught
in
the
words
the
irishman
used
words
as
i
found
later
that
were
a
mixture
of
professor
james
and
stahl
flavored
strongly
with
terence
but
a
suggestion
potent
enough
to
have
haunted
me
ever
since
and
to
have
instilled
meanings
of
stupendous
divinity
into
all
the
commonest
things
of
daily
existence
mountains
seas
wide
landscapes
forests
all
i
see
now
with
emotions
of
wonder
delight
and
awe
unknown
to
me
before
flowers
rain
wind
even
a
london
fog
have
come
to
hold
new
meanings
i
never
realized
before
that
the
mere
of
our
old
planet
could
have
hindered
the
perception
of
so
fair
a
vision
or
her
mere
quantitative
bulk
have
killed
automatically
in
the
mind
the
possible
idea
of
her
being
in
some
sense
living
a
microbe
endowed
with
our
powers
of
consciousness
might
similarly
deny
life
to
the
body
of
the
elephant
on
which
it
rode
or
some
wee
arguing
atom
endowed
with
mind
and
senses
persuade
itself
that
the
monster
upon
whose
flesh
it
dwelt
were
similarly
a
heavenly
body
of
dead
inert
matter
the
bulk
of
the
world
that
carried
them
obstructing
their
perception
of
its
life
and
fechner
as
it
seems
was
no
mere
dreamer
playing
with
a
huge
poetical
conception
professor
of
physics
in
leipsic
university
he
found
time
amid
voluminous
labors
in
chemistry
to
study
electrical
science
with
the
result
that
his
measurements
in
galvanism
are
classic
to
this
day
his
philosophical
work
was
more
than
considerable
a
book
on
the
atomic
theory
classic
also
four
elaborate
mathematical
and
experimental
volumes
on
what
he
called
psychophysics
many
persons
consider
fechner
to
have
practically
founded
scientific
psychology
in
the
first
of
these
books
a
volume
on
organic
evolution
and
two
works
on
experimental
æsthetics
in
which
again
fechner
is
thought
by
some
judges
to
have
laid
the
foundations
of
a
new
science
are
among
his
other
performances
all
leipsic
mourned
him
when
he
died
for
he
was
the
pattern
of
the
ideal
german
scholar
as
daringly
original
in
his
thought
as
he
was
homely
in
his
life
a
modest
genial
laborious
slave
to
truth
and
learning
his
mind
was
indeed
one
of
those
multitudinously
organized
crossroads
of
truth
which
are
occupied
only
at
rare
intervals
by
children
of
men
and
from
which
nothing
is
either
too
far
or
too
near
to
be
seen
in
due
perspective
patientest
observation
exactest
mathematics
shrewdest
discrimination
humanest
feeling
flourished
in
him
on
the
largest
scale
with
no
apparent
detriment
to
one
another
he
was
in
fact
a
philosopher
in
the
sense
yes
said
softly
in
my
ear
as
we
leaned
against
the
chimneys
and
watched
the
tobacco
curl
up
to
the
stars
and
it
was
this
imagination
that
had
evidently
caught
old
stahl
and
bowled
him
over
i
never
fathomed
the
doctor
quite
his
critical
and
imaginative
apparatus
got
a
bit
mixed
up
i
suspect
for
one
moment
he
cursed
me
for
asking
questions
and
the
next
sneered
sarcastically
at
me
for
boiling
over
with
a
sudden
inspirational
fancy
of
my
own
he
never
gave
himself
away
completely
and
left
me
to
guess
that
he
made
that
hospital
place
too
hot
to
hold
him
he
was
a
wonderful
bird
but
every
time
i
aimed
at
him
i
shot
wide
and
hit
a
cloud
meantime
he
peppered
me
all
over
one
minute
urging
me
into
closer
intimacy
with
my
russian
his
cosmic
being
his
type
so
that
he
might
study
my
destruction
and
half
an
hour
later
doing
his
utmost
apparently
to
protect
me
from
him
and
keep
me
sane
and
balanced
his
laugh
rang
out
over
the
roofs
the
net
result
he
added
his
face
tilted
toward
the
stars
as
though
he
said
it
to
the
open
sky
rather
than
to
me
was
that
he
pushed
me
forwards
into
the
greatest
adventure
life
has
ever
brought
to
me
i
believe
i
verily
believe
that
sometimes
there
were
moments
of
unconsciousness
perhaps
when
i
really
did
leave
my
body
caught
away
as
moses
or
was
it
job
or
paul
into
a
third
heaven
where
i
touched
a
bit
of
reality
that
fairly
made
me
reel
with
happiness
and
wonder
well
but
fechner
and
his
great
idea
i
brought
him
back
he
tossed
his
cigarette
down
into
the
that
fringed
the
park
leaning
over
to
watch
its
zigzag
flight
of
flame
is
simply
this
he
replied
not
alone
the
earth
but
the
whole
universe
in
its
different
spans
and
is
everywhere
alive
and
conscious
he
regards
the
spiritual
as
the
rule
in
nature
not
the
exception
the
professorial
philosophers
have
no
vision
fechner
towers
above
them
as
a
man
of
vision
he
dared
to
imagine
he
made
discoveries
whew
he
whistled
and
such
discoveries
to
which
the
scholars
and
professors
of
today
i
suggested
would
think
reply
not
even
called
for
ah
he
laughed
the
intellectuals
with
their
narrow
outlook
their
atrophied
vision
and
their
long
words
perhaps
but
in
fechner
universe
there
is
room
for
every
grade
of
spiritual
being
between
man
and
god
the
vaster
orders
of
mind
go
with
the
vaster
orders
of
body
he
believes
passionately
in
the
earth
soul
he
treats
her
as
our
special
guardian
angel
we
can
pray
to
the
earth
as
men
pray
to
their
saints
the
earth
has
a
collective
consciousness
we
rise
upon
the
earth
as
wavelets
rise
upon
the
ocean
we
grow
out
of
her
soil
as
leaves
grow
from
a
tree
sometimes
we
find
our
bigger
life
and
realize
that
we
are
parts
of
her
bigger
collective
consciousness
but
as
a
rule
we
are
aware
only
of
our
separateness
as
individuals
these
moments
of
cosmic
consciousness
are
rare
they
come
with
love
sometimes
with
pain
music
may
bring
them
too
but
above
all
landscape
and
the
beauty
of
nature
men
are
too
petty
conceited
egoistic
to
welcome
them
clinging
for
dear
life
to
their
precious
individualities
he
drew
breath
and
then
went
on
likens
our
individual
persons
on
the
earth
to
so
many
of
her
soul
adding
to
her
perceptive
life
so
long
as
our
own
life
lasts
she
absorbs
our
perceptions
just
as
they
occur
into
her
larger
sphere
of
knowledge
when
one
of
us
dies
it
is
as
if
an
eye
of
the
world
were
closed
for
all
perceptive
contributions
from
that
particular
quarter
cease
go
on
i
exclaimed
realizing
that
he
was
obviously
quoting
verbatim
fragments
from
james
that
he
had
since
pondered
over
till
they
had
become
his
own
tell
me
more
it
is
delightful
and
very
splendid
yes
he
said
i
go
on
quick
enough
provided
you
promise
me
one
thing
and
that
is
to
understand
that
fechner
does
not
regard
the
earth
as
a
sort
of
big
human
being
if
a
being
at
all
she
is
a
being
utterly
different
from
us
in
kind
as
of
course
we
know
she
is
in
structure
planetary
beings
as
a
class
would
be
totally
different
from
any
other
beings
that
we
know
he
merely
protests
at
the
presumption
of
our
insignificant
human
knowledge
in
denying
some
kind
of
life
and
consciousness
to
a
form
so
beautifully
and
marvelously
organized
as
that
of
the
earth
the
heavenly
bodies
he
holds
are
beings
superior
to
men
in
the
scale
of
life
a
vaster
order
of
intelligence
altogether
a
little
man
with
his
cocksure
reason
strutting
on
its
tiny
brain
as
the
apex
of
attainment
he
ridicules
d
see
now
i
gasped
i
lit
a
big
pipe
and
listened
he
went
on
this
time
it
was
clearly
a
page
from
that
hibbert
lecture
stahl
had
mentioned
the
one
in
which
professor
james
tries
to
give
some
idea
of
fechner
aim
and
scope
while
admitting
that
he
inevitably
does
him
miserable
injustice
by
summarizing
and
abridging
him
ages
ago
the
earth
was
called
an
animal
i
ventured
we
all
know
that
but
fechner
he
replied
insists
that
a
planet
is
a
higher
class
of
being
than
either
man
or
animal
being
whose
enormous
size
requires
an
altogether
different
plan
of
life
an
inhabitant
of
the
ether
you
hit
it
he
replied
eagerly
every
element
has
its
own
living
denizens
ether
then
also
has
hers
the
globes
ocean
of
ether
whose
waves
are
light
has
also
her
denizens
higher
by
as
much
as
their
element
is
higher
swimming
without
fins
flying
without
wings
moving
immense
and
tranquil
as
by
a
force
through
the
sea
which
they
inhabit
sensitive
to
the
slightest
pull
of
one
another
attraction
beings
in
every
way
superior
to
us
any
imagination
you
know
he
added
can
play
with
the
idea
it
is
old
as
the
hills
but
this
chap
showed
how
and
why
it
could
be
actually
true
this
superiority
though
i
queried
i
should
have
guessed
their
stage
of
development
lower
than
ours
rather
than
higher
different
he
answered
different
that
the
point
ah
i
watched
a
shooting
star
dive
across
our
thick
wet
atmosphere
and
caught
myself
wondering
whether
the
flash
and
heat
of
that
hurrying
little
visitor
produced
any
reaction
in
this
collective
consciousness
of
the
huge
body
whereon
we
perched
and
chattered
and
upon
which
later
it
would
fall
in
finest
dust
it
is
by
insisting
on
the
differences
as
well
as
on
the
resemblances
rushed
on
the
excited
that
he
makes
the
picture
of
the
life
so
concrete
think
a
moment
for
instance
our
animal
organization
comes
from
our
inferiority
our
need
of
moving
to
and
fro
of
stretching
our
limbs
and
bending
our
bodies
shows
only
our
defect
defect
i
cried
but
we
so
proud
of
it
what
are
our
legs
he
laughed
crutches
by
means
of
which
with
restless
efforts
we
go
hunting
after
the
things
we
have
not
inside
ourselves
the
earth
is
no
such
cripple
why
should
she
who
already
possesses
within
herself
the
things
we
so
painfully
pursue
have
limbs
analogous
to
ours
what
need
has
she
of
arms
with
nothing
to
reach
for
of
a
neck
with
no
head
to
carry
of
eyes
or
nose
when
she
finds
her
way
through
space
without
either
and
has
the
millions
of
eyes
of
all
her
animals
to
guide
their
movements
on
her
surface
and
all
their
noses
to
smell
the
flowers
she
grows
we
are
literally
a
part
of
her
then
projections
of
her
immense
life
as
it
were
one
of
the
projections
at
least
exactly
and
just
as
we
are
ourselves
a
part
of
the
earth
he
continued
taking
up
my
thought
at
once
so
are
our
organs
her
organs
is
as
it
were
eye
and
ear
over
her
whole
extent
all
that
we
see
and
hear
in
separation
she
sees
and
hears
at
once
he
stood
up
beside
me
and
spread
his
hands
out
to
the
stars
and
over
the
trees
and
paths
of
the
park
at
our
feet
where
the
throngs
of
men
and
women
walked
and
talked
together
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
his
enthusiasm
grew
as
the
idea
of
this
german
towering
imagination
possessed
him
brings
forth
living
beings
of
countless
kinds
upon
her
surface
and
their
multitudinous
conscious
relations
with
each
other
she
takes
up
into
her
higher
and
more
general
conscious
life
he
leaned
over
the
parapet
and
drew
me
to
his
side
i
stared
with
him
at
the
reflection
of
london
town
in
the
sky
thinking
of
the
glow
and
heat
and
restless
stir
of
the
great
city
and
of
the
frantic
strivings
of
its
millions
for
success
money
power
fame
a
few
here
and
there
for
spiritual
success
the
roar
of
its
huge
trafficking
beat
across
the
night
in
ugly
thunder
to
our
ears
i
thought
of
the
other
cities
of
the
world
of
its
villages
of
shepherds
among
the
lonely
hills
of
its
myriad
wild
creatures
in
forest
plain
and
mountain
all
this
she
takes
up
into
her
great
heart
as
part
of
herself
i
murmured
all
this
he
replied
softly
as
the
sound
of
the
band
beyond
the
serpentine
floated
over
to
us
on
our
roof
the
separate
little
consciousnesses
of
all
the
cities
all
the
tribes
all
the
nations
of
men
animals
flowers
insects
everything
he
again
opened
his
arms
to
the
sky
he
drew
in
deep
breaths
of
the
night
air
the
dew
glistened
on
the
slates
behind
us
far
across
the
towers
of
westminster
a
yellow
moon
rose
slowly
dimming
the
stars
big
ben
deeply
booming
trembled
on
the
air
nine
of
her
stupendous
vibrations
automatically
i
counted
them
subconsciously
and
all
our
subconscious
sensations
are
also
hers
he
added
catching
my
thought
again
our
dreams
but
half
divined
our
aspirations
half
confessed
our
tears
our
yearnings
and
our
prayers
at
the
moment
it
almost
seemed
to
me
as
if
our
two
minds
joined
each
knowing
the
currents
of
the
other
thought
and
both
caught
up
gathered
ill
folded
comfortably
away
into
the
stream
of
a
consciousness
far
bigger
than
either
it
was
like
a
momentary
specific
proof
of
what
he
urged
a
faint
we
heard
of
the
soul
of
the
earth
and
it
was
amazingly
uplifting
every
form
of
life
then
is
of
importance
i
heard
myself
thinking
or
saying
for
i
hardly
knew
which
the
tiniest
efforts
of
value
even
the
unrecognized
ones
and
those
that
seem
futile
even
the
failures
he
whispered
the
moments
when
we
do
not
trust
her
we
stood
for
some
moments
in
silence
presently
with
a
hand
upon
my
shoulder
he
drew
me
down
again
among
our
rugs
against
the
and
there
are
some
of
us
he
said
gently
yet
with
a
voice
that
held
the
trembling
of
an
immense
joy
who
know
a
more
intimate
relationship
with
their
great
mother
than
the
rest
perhaps
by
the
love
of
nature
or
by
some
artless
simplicity
of
soul
wholly
unmodern
of
course
perhaps
felt
by
children
or
poets
mostly
they
lie
caught
close
to
her
own
deep
life
knowing
the
immense
sweet
guidance
of
her
mighty
soul
divinely
mothered
strangers
to
all
the
strife
for
material
gain
to
that
which
men
miscall
delight
primitive
children
of
her
potent
youth
offspring
of
pure
passion
each
individual
conscious
of
her
weight
and
drive
behind
him
his
words
faded
away
into
a
whisper
that
became
unintelligible
then
inaudible
but
his
thought
somehow
continued
itself
in
my
own
mind
the
simple
life
i
said
in
a
low
tone
the
call
of
the
wild
raised
to
its
highest
power
but
he
changed
my
sentence
a
little
the
call
he
answered
without
turning
to
look
at
me
speaking
it
into
the
night
about
us
the
call
to
childhood
the
true
pure
vital
childhood
of
the
earth
the
golden
age
before
men
tasted
of
the
tree
and
knew
themselves
separate
when
the
lion
and
the
lamb
lay
down
together
and
a
little
child
could
lead
them
a
time
and
state
that
is
of
which
such
phrases
can
be
symbolical
and
of
which
there
may
be
here
and
there
some
fearful
exquisite
survival
i
suggested
remembering
stahl
words
his
eyes
shone
with
the
fire
of
his
passion
of
which
on
that
little
tourist
steamer
i
found
one
the
wind
that
fanned
our
faces
came
perhaps
across
the
arid
wastes
of
bayswater
and
the
it
also
came
from
the
mountains
and
gardens
of
this
lost
arcadia
vanished
for
most
beyond
recovery
the
hebrew
poets
called
it
before
the
fall
he
went
on
and
later
poets
the
golden
age
today
it
shines
through
phrases
like
the
land
of
heart
desire
the
promised
land
paradise
and
what
not
while
the
minds
of
saint
and
mystic
have
ever
dreamed
of
it
as
union
with
their
deity
for
it
is
possible
and
open
to
all
to
every
heart
that
is
not
blinded
by
the
cloaking
horror
of
materialism
which
blocks
the
doorways
of
escape
and
prisons
self
behind
the
drab
illusion
that
the
outer
form
is
the
reality
and
riot
the
inner
thought
the
hoarse
shouting
of
a
couple
of
drunken
men
floated
to
us
from
the
pavements
and
crossing
over
we
peered
down
toward
the
opening
of
sloane
street
watching
a
moment
the
stream
of
broughams
motors
and
pedestrians
the
two
men
with
the
rage
of
an
artificial
stimulant
in
their
brains
reeled
out
of
sight
a
big
policeman
followed
slowly
the
of
the
great
glaring
city
poured
on
unceasingly
the
stream
of
souls
all
hurrying
by
divers
routes
and
means
toward
a
state
where
they
sought
to
lose
themselves
to
forget
the
pressure
of
the
bars
that
held
them
to
escape
the
fret
and
worry
of
their
harassing
personalities
and
touch
some
fringe
of
happiness
all
so
sure
they
knew
the
way
yet
hurrying
really
in
the
wrong
direction
outwards
instead
of
inwards
afraid
to
be
simple
we
moved
back
to
our
rugs
for
a
long
time
neither
of
us
found
anything
to
say
soon
i
led
the
way
down
the
creaking
ladder
indoors
again
and
we
entered
the
stuffy
little
of
the
tiny
flat
he
temporarily
occupied
i
turned
up
an
electric
light
but
begged
me
to
lower
it
i
only
had
time
to
see
that
his
eyes
were
still
aglow
we
sat
by
the
open
window
he
drew
a
worn
notebook
from
his
still
more
worn
coat
but
it
was
too
dark
for
him
to
read
he
knew
it
all
by
heart
xvii
some
of
fechner
reasons
for
thinking
the
earth
a
being
superior
in
the
scale
to
ourselves
he
gave
but
it
was
another
passage
that
lingered
chiefly
in
my
heart
the
description
of
the
daring
german
joy
in
dwelling
upon
her
perfections
later
too
of
his
first
simple
vision
though
myself
wholly
of
the
earth
earthy
in
the
ordinary
sense
the
beauty
of
the
thoughts
live
in
my
spirit
to
this
day
transfiguring
even
that
dingy
insurance
office
streaming
through
all
my
dullest
hardest
daily
tasks
with
the
inspiration
of
a
simple
delight
that
helps
me
over
many
a
difficult
weary
time
of
work
and
duty
carry
her
precious
freight
through
the
hours
and
seasons
what
form
could
be
more
excellent
than
hers
being
as
it
is
horse
wheels
and
wagon
all
in
one
think
of
her
beauty
a
shining
ball
and
sunlit
over
one
half
the
other
bathed
in
starry
night
reflecting
the
heavens
from
all
her
waters
myriads
of
lights
and
shadows
in
the
folds
of
her
mountains
and
windings
of
her
valleys
she
would
be
a
spectacle
of
rainbow
glory
could
one
only
see
her
from
afar
as
we
see
parts
of
her
from
her
own
mountain
tops
every
quality
of
landscape
that
has
a
name
would
then
be
visible
in
her
all
at
once
all
that
is
delicate
or
graceful
all
that
is
quiet
or
wild
or
romantic
or
desolate
or
cheerful
or
luxuriant
or
fresh
landscape
is
her
a
peopled
landscape
too
for
men
eyes
would
appear
in
it
like
diamonds
among
the
green
would
be
the
dominant
color
but
the
blue
atmosphere
and
the
clouds
would
enfold
her
as
a
bride
is
shrouded
in
her
veil
a
veil
the
vapory
transparent
folds
of
which
the
earth
through
her
ministers
the
winds
never
tires
of
laying
and
folding
about
herself
anew
she
needs
as
a
sentient
organism
he
continued
pointing
into
the
curtain
of
blue
night
beyond
the
window
no
heart
or
brain
or
lungs
as
we
do
for
she
is
different
functions
she
performs
she
has
no
proper
muscles
or
limbs
of
her
own
and
the
only
objects
external
to
her
are
the
other
stars
to
these
her
whole
mass
reacts
by
the
most
exquisite
alterations
in
its
total
gait
and
by
the
still
more
exquisite
vibratory
responses
in
its
substance
her
ocean
reflects
the
lights
of
heaven
as
in
a
mighty
mirror
her
atmosphere
refracts
them
like
a
monstrous
lens
the
clouds
and
snowfields
combine
them
into
white
the
woods
and
flowers
disperse
them
into
colors
men
have
always
made
fables
about
angels
dwelling
in
the
light
needing
no
earthly
food
or
drink
messengers
between
ourselves
and
god
here
are
actually
existent
beings
dwelling
in
the
light
and
moving
through
the
sky
needing
neither
food
nor
drink
intermediaries
between
god
and
us
obeying
his
commands
so
if
the
heavens
really
are
the
home
of
angels
the
heavenly
bodies
must
be
those
very
angels
for
other
creatures
there
are
none
yes
the
earth
is
our
great
common
guardian
angel
who
watches
over
all
our
interests
combined
and
then
whispered
the
irishman
seeing
that
i
still
eagerly
listened
give
your
ear
to
one
of
his
moments
of
direct
vision
note
its
simplicity
and
the
authority
of
its
conviction
a
certain
spring
morning
i
went
out
to
walk
the
fields
were
green
the
birds
sang
the
dew
glistened
the
smoke
was
rising
here
and
there
a
man
appeared
a
light
as
of
transfiguration
lay
on
all
things
it
was
only
a
little
bit
of
the
earth
it
was
only
a
moment
of
her
existence
and
yet
as
my
look
embraced
her
more
and
more
it
seemed
to
me
not
only
so
beautiful
an
idea
but
so
true
and
clear
a
fact
that
she
is
an
angel
an
angel
so
rich
and
fresh
and
and
yet
going
her
round
in
the
skies
so
firmly
and
so
at
one
with
herself
turning
her
whole
living
face
to
heaven
and
carrying
me
along
with
her
into
that
heaven
that
i
asked
myself
how
the
opinions
of
men
could
ever
have
so
spun
themselves
away
from
life
as
to
deem
the
earth
only
a
dry
clod
and
to
seek
for
angels
above
it
or
about
it
in
the
emptiness
of
the
sky
only
to
find
them
nowhere
clanging
as
with
a
hurrying
anger
through
the
night
broke
in
upon
his
impassioned
sentences
the
shouts
of
the
men
drowned
his
last
words
life
became
very
wonderful
inside
those
tight
confining
walls
for
the
spell
and
grandeur
of
the
whole
conception
lifted
the
heart
even
if
belief
failed
in
the
sense
of
believing
a
shilling
it
succeeded
in
the
sense
of
believing
a
symphony
the
invading
beauty
swept
about
us
both
here
was
a
glory
that
was
also
a
driving
power
upon
which
any
but
a
man
half
dead
could
draw
for
practical
use
for
the
big
conceptions
fan
the
will
the
little
pains
of
life
they
make
one
feel
need
not
kill
true
joy
nor
deaden
effort
come
said
softly
interrupting
my
dream
of
hope
and
splendor
let
us
walk
together
through
the
park
to
your
place
it
is
late
and
you
i
know
have
to
be
up
early
in
the
morning
earlier
than
i
and
presently
we
passed
the
statue
of
achilles
and
got
our
feet
upon
the
turf
beyond
a
little
bit
of
living
planet
in
the
middle
of
the
heavy
smothering
london
town
about
us
over
us
within
us
stirred
the
awe
of
that
immense
idea
upon
that
bit
of
living
growing
turf
we
passed
toward
the
marble
arch
treading
as
it
were
the
skin
of
a
huge
body
the
physical
expression
of
a
grand
angelic
being
alive
sentient
conscious
conscious
moreover
of
our
little
separate
individual
selves
who
walked
a
being
who
cared
who
felt
us
who
knew
understood
and
loved
us
as
a
mother
her
own
offspring
to
whom
men
could
pray
as
they
pray
to
their
saints
the
conception
even
thus
dimly
and
confusedly
adumbrated
brought
a
new
sense
of
life
terrific
and
eternal
all
living
things
upon
the
surface
were
emanations
of
her
mighty
central
soul
all
from
the
gods
and
fairies
of
olden
time
who
knew
it
to
the
men
and
women
of
today
who
have
forgotten
it
the
gods
were
these
then
projections
of
her
personality
aspects
and
facets
of
her
divided
self
emanations
now
withdrawn
latent
in
her
did
they
still
exist
as
moods
or
powers
true
alive
everlasting
but
unmanifest
still
knowable
to
simple
men
and
to
children
of
nature
was
this
the
giant
truth
that
stahl
had
built
on
fechner
everything
about
us
seemed
to
draw
together
into
an
immense
and
towering
configuration
that
included
trees
and
air
and
the
sweep
of
open
park
the
looming
and
overwhelming
beauty
of
one
of
these
very
gods
survived
pan
the
eternal
and
the
splendid
a
mood
of
the
a
projection
clothed
with
the
light
of
stars
the
cloudy
air
the
passion
of
the
night
the
thrill
of
an
august
extended
mood
and
the
others
were
not
so
very
far
behind
those
other
little
parcels
of
earth
consciousness
the
greeks
and
early
races
the
simple
primitive
childlike
peoples
of
the
dawn
divined
the
existence
of
and
labeled
gods
and
worshipped
so
as
to
draw
their
powers
into
themselves
by
ecstasy
and
vision
could
then
worship
now
still
recall
them
was
the
attitude
of
even
one
true
worshipper
heart
the
force
necessary
to
touch
that
particular
aspect
of
the
mighty
total
consciousness
of
earth
and
call
forth
those
ancient
forms
of
beauty
could
it
be
that
this
idea
the
idea
of
the
gods
was
thus
forever
true
and
vital
and
might
they
be
known
and
felt
in
the
heart
if
not
actually
in
some
suggested
form
i
only
know
that
as
we
walked
home
past
the
doors
of
that
dingy
paddington
house
where
terence
kept
his
dusty
books
and
papers
and
so
to
my
own
quarters
these
things
he
talked
about
dropped
into
my
mind
with
a
bewildering
splendor
to
stay
forever
his
words
i
have
forgotten
or
how
he
made
such
speculations
worth
listening
to
at
all
yet
i
hear
them
singing
in
my
blood
as
though
of
yesterday
and
often
when
that
conflict
comes
duty
and
desire
that
makes
life
sometimes
so
vain
and
bitter
the
memory
comes
to
lift
with
strength
far
greater
than
my
own
the
earth
can
heal
and
bless

with
the
passing
of
calabria
spring
had
leaped
into
the
softness
of
full
summer
and
the
breezes
were
gentle
as
those
that
long
ago
fanned
the
cheeks
and
hair
of
io
beloved
of

as
she
flew
southwards
toward
the

the
passengers
less
lovely
than
that
fair
daughter
of
argos
and
with
the
unrest
of
thinner
adventure
in
their
blood
basked
lazily
in
the
sun
but
the
sea
was
not
less
haunted
for
those
among
them
whose
hearts
could
travel
the
irishman
at
any
rate
slipped
beyond
the
confines
of
the
body
viewing
that
ancient
scene
as
she
had
done
from
above
his
widening
consciousness
expanded
to
include
it
cachalots
spouted
dolphins
danced
as
though
still
to
those
wild
flutes
of
dionysus
porpoises
rolled
beneath
the
surface
of
the
transparent

diving
below

sides
but
just
in
time
to
save
their
shiny
noses
and
all
day
long
ignoring
the
chart
upon
the
stairway
walls
the
tourists
turned
their
glasses
eastwards
searching
for
a
first
sight
of
greece
meanwhile
trod
the
decks
of
a
new
ship
for
him
now
sea
and
sky
were
doubly
peopled
the
wind
brought
messages
of
some
divine
deliverance
approaching
slowly
the
heat
of
that
pearly
shining
sun
warmed
centers
of
his
being
that
hitherto
the
world
kept
chill
the
land
toward
which
the
busy
steamer
moved
he
knew
of
course
was
but
the
shell
from
which
the
inner
spirit
of
beauty
once
vivifying
it
had
long
since
passed
away
yet
it
remained
a
clue
that
ancient
loveliness
as
a
mood
of
the
earth
early
consciousness
was
buried
not
destroyed
eternally
it
still
flamed
somewhere
and
long
before
the
days
of
greece
he
knew
it
had
existed
in
yet
fuller
and
more
complete
manifestation
that
earliest
vastly
splendid
mood
of
the
earth
soul
too
mighty
for
any
existence
that
the
history
of
humanity
can
recall
and
too
remote
for
any
but
the
most
daringly
imaginative
minds
even
to
conceive
the
mood
as
stahl
himself
admitted
even
while
it
called
to
him
was
a
reconstruction
that
to
men
today
could
only
seem
dangerous
and
his
own
little
self
guided
by
the
inarticulate
stranger
was
being
led
at
last
toward
its
complete
recapture
yet
while
he
crawled
slowly
with
the
steamer
over
a
tiny
portion
of
the
spinning
globe
feeling
that
at
the
same
time
he
crawled
toward
a
spot
upon
it
where
access
would
be
somehow
possible
to
this
huge
expression
of
her
first
life
what
was
it
phrased
timidly
as
men
phrase
big
thoughts
today
that
he
really
believed
even
in
our
london
talks
intimate
as
they
were
interpreted
too
by
gesture
facial
expression
and
silence
his
full
meaning
evaded
precise
definition
there
are
no
words
there
are
no
words
he
kept
saying
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
stroking
his
untidy
hair
in
me
deep
down
it
all
lies
clear
and
plain
and
strong
but
language
can
not
seize
a
mode
of
life
that
throve
before
language
existed
if
you
can
not
catch
the
picture
from
my
thoughts
i
give
up
the
whole
dream
in
despair
and
in
his
written
account
owing
to
its
strange
formlessness
the
result
was
not
a
little
bewildering
briefly
stated
however
that
remnant
at
least
which
i
discover
in
my
own
mind
when
attempting
to
tell
the
story
to
others
what
he
felt
believed
at
any
rate
while
the
adventure
lasted
was
this
that
the
earth
as
a
living
conscious
being
had
known
visible
projections
of
her
consciousness
similar
to
those
projections
of
our
own
personality
which
the
advanced
psychologists
of
today
now
envisage
as
possible
that
the
simple
savagery
of
his
own
nature
and
the
poignant
yearnings
derived
from
it
were
in
reality
due
to
his
intimate
closeness
to
the
life
of
the
earth
that
whereas
in
the
body
the
fulfillment
of
these
longings
was
impossible
in
the
spirit
he
might
yet
know
contact
with
the
soul
of
the
planet
and
thus
experience
their
complete
satisfaction
further
that
the
portion
of
his
personality
which
could
thus
enter
this
heaven
of
its
own
subjective
construction
was
that
detachable
portion
stahl
had
spoken
of
as
being
malleable
by
desire
and
longing
leaving
the
body
partially
and
temporarily
sometimes
in
sleep
and
at
death
completely
more
that
the
state
thus
entered
would
mean
a
back
into
the
life
of
the
earth
herself
of
which
he
was
a
partial
expression
this
closeness
to
nature
was
today
so
rare
as
to
be
almost
unrecognized
as
possible
its
possession
constituted
its
owner
what
the
doctor
called
a
cosmic
being
a
being
scarcely
differentiated
from
the
life
of
the
earth
spirit
herself
a
direct
expression
of
her
life
a
survival
of
a
time
before
such
expressions
had
separated
away
from
her
and
become
individualized
as
human
creatures
moreover
certain
of
these
earliest
manifestations
or
projections
of
her
consciousness
knowing
in
their
huge
shapes
of
fearful
yet
simple
beauty
a
glory
of
her
own
being
still
also
survived
the
generic
term
of
gods
might
describe
their
status
as
interpreted
to
the
little
human
power
called
imagination
this
call
to
the
simple
life
of
primal
innocence
and
wonder
that
had
ever
brimmed
the
heart
of
the
irishman
acknowledged
while
not
understood
might
have
slumbered
itself
away
with
the
years
among
modern
conditions
into
atrophy
and
denial
had
he
not
chanced
to
encounter
a
more
direct
and
vital
instance
of
it
even
than
himself
the
being
of
this
russian
stranger
had
summoned
it
forth
the
mere
presence
of
this
man
quickened
and
evoked
this
center
in
his
psychic
being
that
opened
the
channel
of
return
speech
as
any
other
explanation
was
unnecessary
to
resist
was
still
within
his
power
to
accept
and
go
was
also
open
to
him
the
inner
catastrophe
he
feared
need
not
perhaps
be
insuperable
or
permanent
remember
the
doctor
had
said
to
him
at
the
end
of
that
last
significant
conversation
this
berth
in
my
stateroom
is
freely
at
your
disposal
till
batoum
and
thanking
him
had
shaken
off
that
restraining
hand
upon
his
arm
knowing
that
he
would
never
make
use
of
it
again
for
the
russian
stranger
and
his
son
had
somehow
made
him
free
between
that
cabin
and
the
decks
he
spent
his
day
occasionally
he
would
go
below
to
report
progress
as
it
were
by
little
sentences
which
he
divined
would
be
acceptable
and
at
the
same
time
gave
expression
to
his
own
growing
delight
the
boy
meanwhile
was
everywhere
playing
alone
like
a
wild
thing
one
minute
in
the
bows
hat
off
gazing
across
the
sea
beneath
a
shading
hand
and
the
next
leaning
over
the
to
watch
the
churning
foam
that
drove
them
forwards
at
regular
intervals
he
too
rushed
to
the
cabin
and
brought
communications
to
his
parent
tomorrow
at
dawn
observed
the
irishman
we
shall
see
cape
mattapan
rising
from
the
sea
after
that
athens
for
a
few
hours
then
coasting
through
the
cyclades
close
to
the
mainland
often
and
glancing
over
to
the
berth
while
pretending
to
be
busy
with
his
he
saw
the
great
smile
of
happiness
break
over
the
other
face
like
a
sunrise
for
it
was
clear
to
him
that
with
the
approach
to
greece
a
change
began
to
come
over
his
companions
it
was
noticeable
chiefly
in
the
father
the
joy
that
filled
the
man
too
fine
and
large
to
be
named
excitement
passed
from
him
in
radiations
that
positively
seemed
to
carry
with
them
a
physical
extension
this
of
course
was
purely
a
clairvoyant
effect
upon
the
mind
divining
faculty
visualized
the
spiritual
traits
of
the
man
dilating
self
but
nevertheless
the
truth
remained
that
somehow
he
increased
he
grew
became
interiorly
more
active
alive
potent
and
of
this
singular
waxing
of
the
inner
spirit
something
passed
outwards
and
stood
with
rare
dignity
about
his
very
figure
and
this
manifestation
of
themselves
was
due
to
that
expansion
of
the
inner
life
caused
by
happiness
the
little
point
of
their
personalities
they
showed
normally
to
the
world
was
but
a
single
facet
a
tip
as
it
were
of
their
whole
selves
more
lay
within
beyond
as
with
the
rest
of
the
world
a
great
emotion
stimulated
and
summoned
it
forth
into
activity
nearer
the
surface
clearly
for
these
two
greece
symbolized
a
point
of
departure
of
a
great
hidden
passion
something
they
expected
lay
waiting
for
them
there
guidance
would
come
thence
and
by
reflection
perhaps
as
much
as
by
direct
stimulation
the
same
change
made
itself
felt
in
himself
joy
caught
him
the
joy
of
a
long
deferred
at
the
same
time
the
warning
of
stahl
worked
in
him
if
subconsciously
only
he
showed
this
by
mixing
more
with
the
other
passengers
he
chatted
with
the
captain
who
was
as
pleased
with
his
big
family
as
though
he
had
personally
provided
the
weather
that
made
them
happy
with
the
armenian
priest
who
was
eager
to
show
that
he
had
read
a
much
of
and
keeplin
and
especially
with
the
boasting
moscow
merchant
who
by
this
time
owned
the
and
imposed
his
verbose
commonplaces
upon
one
and
all
with
authoritative
in
six
languages
a
provincial
mind
in
full
display
the
latter
in
particular
held
him
to
a
normal
humanity
his
atmosphere
breathed
the
wholesome
thickness
of
the
majority
of
humankind
ordinary
egoistic
with
the
simplicity
of
the
uninspiring
sort
the
merchant
acted
upon
him
as
a
sedative
and
that
day
the
irishman
took
him
in
large
doses
allopathically
for
his
talk
formed
an
admirable
antidote
to
the
stress
of
that
other
burning
excitement
that
according
to
stahl
threatened
to
disintegrate
his
personality
though
hardly
in
the
sense
he
intended
the
was
entirely
delightful
engaging
as
a
child
for
among
other
marked
qualities
he
possessed
the
unerring
instinct
of
the
snob
which
made
him
select
for
his
friends
those
whose
names
or
position
might
glorify
his
banal
insignificance
and
his
stories
were
vivid
pictorial
illustrations
of
this
useful
worldly
faculty
listened
with
secret
delight
keeping
a
grave
face
and
dropping
in
occasional
innocent
questions
to
heighten
the
color
or
increase
the
output
others
in
the
circle
responded
in
kind
feeling
the
same
chord
vibrating
in
themselves
even
the
priest
like
a
continually
discharged
his
little
secret
pride
that
byron
had
occupied
a
room
in
that
venetian
monastery
where
he
lived
and
at
last
himself
was
conscious
of
an
inclination
to
report
his
own
immense
and
recently
discovered
kinship
with
a
greater
soul
and
consciousness
than
his
own
after
all
he
reflected
with
a
deep
thrill
while
he
listened
the
desire
of
the
snob
was
but
a
crude
and
simple
form
of
the
desire
of
the
mystic
to
lose
one
little
self
in
a
self
which
is
greater
then
weary
of
them
all
and
their
minute
personal
interests
he
left
the
and
joined
the
boy
again
running
absurd
races
with
him
from
stern
to
bow
playing
among
the
decks
even
playing
together
they
sweated
in
the
blazing
sun
and
watched
the
dance
of
the
sea
caught
the
wind
in
their
faces
with
a
shout
of
joy
or
with
pointing
fingers
followed
the
changing
outlines
of
the
rare
soft
clouds
that
sailed
the
world
of
blue
above
them
there
was
no
speech
between
them
and
both
felt
that
other
things
invisible
swift
and
whose
home
is
just
beyond
the
edge
of
life
as
the
senses
report
life
played
wildly
with
them
the
then
with
its
occupants
so
greedy
for
the
things
that
money
connotes
the
furs
champagne
cigars
and
heavy
possessions
that
were
symbols
of
the
personal
aggrandizement
they
sought
and
valued
seemed
to
the
irishman
like
a
where
those
about
to
die
sat
making
inventories
in
blind
pride
of
the
things
they
must
leave
behind
it
was
indeed
a
contrast
of
death
and
life
for
beside
him
with
that
playing
silent
boy
coursed
the
power
of
transforming
loveliness
which
had
breathed
over
the
world
before
her
surface
knew
this
swarming
race
of
men
the
life
of
the
earth
knew
no
need
of
outward
acquisition
possessing
all
things
so
completely
in
herself
and
he
he
was
her
child
o
glory
joy
passing
belief
oh
he
cried
once
with
passion
turning
to
the
figure
of
youth
who
stood
with
him
in
the
bows
meeting
the
soft
wind
oh
to
have
heard
the
trees
whispering
together
in
the
youth
of
the
world
and
felt
one
of
the
earliest
winds
that
ever
blew
across
the
cooling
seas
and
the
boy
not
understanding
the
words
but
responding
with
a
perfect
naturalness
to
the
emotion
that
drove
them
forth
seized
his
hand
and
with
an
extraordinarily
free
motion
as
of
flying
raced
with
him
down
the
decks
happy
laughing
hair
loose
over
his
face
and
with
a
singular
action
of
the
shoulders
as
though
he
somehow
cantered
remembered
his
vision
of
the
flying
shapes
toward
the
evening
however
the
boy
disappeared
keeping
close
to
his
father
side
and
after
dinner
both
retired
early
to
their
cabin
and
the
ship
meanwhile
drew
ever
nearer
to
the
haunted
land
xix
privacy
is
ignorance
josiah
royce
somewhat
after
the
manner
of
things
suffered
in
vivid
dreams
where
surprise
is
numbed
and
wonder
becomes
the
perfect
password
the
irishman
remembers
the
sequence
of
little
events
that
filled
the
following
day
yet
his
excitement
held
nothing
of
the
vicious
fling
of
fever
it
was
spread
over
the
entire
being
rather
than
located
hotly
in
the
brain
and
blood
alone
and
it
derived
as
it
were
from
tracts
of
his
personality
usually
unstirred
atrophied
indeed
in
most
men
that
connected
him
as
by
a
delicate
network
of
feelers
with
nature
and
the
earth
he
came
gradually
to
feel
them
as
a
man
in
certain
abnormal
conditions
becomes
conscious
of
the
bodily
processes
that
customarily
go
on
in
himself
without
definite
recognition
stahl
could
have
told
him
had
he
cared
to
seek
the
information
that
this
fringe
of
wider
consciousness
stretching
to
the
stars
and
winds
and
earth
was
the
very
part
that
had
caused
his
long
unrest
and
yearning
the
part
that
knew
the
earth
as
mother
and
sought
the
sweet
and
savage
freedom
of
what
he
called
with
the
poverty
of
modern
terms
primitive
the
channels
leading
toward
a
state
of
cosmic
consciousness
one
with
the
earth
life
were
being
now
flushed
and
sluiced
by
the
forces
emanating
from
the
persons
of
his
new
companions
and
as
this
new
state
slowly
usurped
command
the
readjustment
of
his
spiritual
economy
thus
involved
caused
other
portions
of
himself
to
sink
into
temporary
abeyance
while
it
alarmed
him
it
was
too
delicious
to
resist
he
made
no
real
attempt
to
resist
yet
he
knew
full
well
that
the
portion
sinking
thus
out
of
sight
was
what
folk
with
such
high
pride
call
reason
judgment
common
sense
in
common
with
animal
bird
and
insect
life
all
intimately
close
to
nature
he
began
to
feel
as
realities
those
subtle
currents
of
the
earth
personality
by
which
the
seals
know
direction
in
the
depths
of
a
sea
by
which
the
homing
pigeons
blaze
trails
through
space
birds
fly
south
the
wild
bees
know
their
pathways
and
all
simple
life
from
the
red
indian
to
the
red
ant
acknowledges
the
viewless
guidance
of
the
mother
enveloping
heart
the
cosmic
life
ran
through
his
being
lighting
signals
offering
service
more
claiming
leadership
with
it
however
came
no
loss
of
individuality
but
rather
a
powerful
increase
of
life
by
means
of
which
for
the
first
time
he
dreamed
of
a
fuller
existence
which
should
eventually
harmonize
and
combine
the
ancient
simplicity
of
soul
that
claimed
the
earth
with
the
modern
complexity
which
indulged
alone
rendered
the
world
so
ugly
and
insignificant
he
experienced
an
immense
driving
push
upon
what
bergson
has
called
the
of
his
being
the
opening
charge
of
his
new
discovery
however
was
more
than
disconcerting
and
it
is
not
surprising
that
he
lost
his
balance
its
attack
and
rush
were
overwhelming
thus
it
was
a
kind
of
exalted
speculative
wonder
lying
behind
his
inner
joy
that
caused
his
mistakes
he
had
imagined
for
instance
that
the
first
sight
of
greece
would
bring
some
climax
of
revelation
making
clear
to
what
particular
type
of
early
life
the
spirits
of
his
companions
conformed
more
that
they
would
then
betray
themselves
to
one
and
all
for
what
they
were
in
some
effort
to
escape
in
some
act
of
unrestraint
something
in
a
word
that
would
explain
themselves
to
the
world
of
passengers
and
focus
them
upon
the
doctor
microscope
forever
yet
when
greece
showed
her
first
fair
rim
of
outline
his
companions
still
slept
peacefully
in
their
bunks
the
anticipated
did
not
appear
nothing
happened
it
was
not
the
mere
sight
of
so
much
land
lying
upon
the
sea
cool
cheek
that
could
prove
vital
in
an
adventure
of
such
a
kind
for
the
adventure
remained
spiritual
had
merely
confused
two
planes
of
consciousness
as
usual
he
saw
the
thing
whole
in
that
extraordinary
way
to
which
his
imagination
alone
held
the
key
and
hence
his
error
yet
the
moment
has
ever
remained
for
him
one
of
vital
stirring
splendor
significant
as
life
or
death
he
remembers
that
he
was
early
on
deck
and
saw
the
dawn
blow
up
softly
from
behind
the
islands
with
a
fresh
salt
wind
that
blew
at
the
same
time
like
music
into
his
very
heart
golden
clear
it
rose
and
just
below
like
the
petals
of
some
vast
archetypal
flower
that
gave
it
birth
the
low
blue
hills
of
coast
and
island
opened
magically
into
blossom
the
rocky
cliffs
of
mattapan
slipped
past
the
smooth
bare
slopes
of
the
ancient
followed
treeless
peaks
and
shoulders
abrupt
precipices
summits
and
ridges
all
exquisitely
rosy
and
alive
he
had
seen
greece
before
yet
never
thus
and
the
emotion
that
invaded
every
corner
of
his
larger
consciousness
lay
infinitely
deeper
than
any
mere
thrill
he
had
known
in
previous
years
he
saw
it
felt
it
knew
it
from
within
instead
of
as
a
spectator
from
without
this
of
the
earth
was
also
his
own
and
upon
his
spirit
as
upon
her
hills
lay
the
tide
of
high
light
with
its
delicate
swift
blush
he
saw
it
with
her
through
one
of
her
opened
eyes
the
hot
hours
the
steamer
lay
in
the
piraeus
harbor
were
wearisome
the
noise
of
loading
and
unloading
cargo
worse
even
than
at
catania
while
the
tourist
passengers
hurried
fussily
ashore
carrying
guidebooks
and
cameras
to
chatter
among
the
ruined
temples
he
walked
the
decks
alone
dreaming
his
great
dream
conscious
that
he
spun
through
leagues
of
space
with
the
great
being
who
more
and
more
possessed
him
beyond
the
shipping
and
the
masts
collected
there
from
all
the
ports
of
the
mediterranean
and
the
levant
he
watched
the
train
puffing
slowly
to
the
station
that
lay
in
the
shadow
of
theseus
temple
but
his
eyes
at
the
same
tune
strained
across
the
haze
toward
eleusis
bay
and
while
his
ears
caught
the
tramping
feet
of
the
long
torchlight
procession
some
power
of
his
remoter
consciousness
divined
the
forms
of
hovering
gods
expressions
of
his
vast
mother
personality
with
which
in
worship
this
ancient
people
had
believed
it
possible
to
merge
themselves
the
significant
truths
that
lay
behind
the
higher
mysteries
degraded
since
because
forgotten
and
misinterpreted
trooped
powerfully
down
into
his
mind
for
the
supreme
act
of
this
profound
cult
denied
by
a
grosser
age
that
seeks
to
telephone
to
heaven
deeming
itself
thereby
advanced
lay
in
the
union
of
the
disciple
with
his
god
the
god
he
worshipped
all
his
life
and
into
whose
person
he
slipped
finally
at
death
by
a
kind
of
marriage
rite
the
gods
ran
again
through
his
mind
with
passion
and
delight
as
the
letter
of
his
early
studies
returned
upon
him
accompanied
now
for
the
first
time
by
the
spirit
that
interpreted
them
the
gods
moods
of
her
giant
life
manifestations
of
her
spreading
consciousness
pushed
outwards
powers
of
life
and
truth
and
beauty
and
meanwhile
stahl
sometimes
from
a
distance
sometimes
coming
close
kept
over
him
a
kind
of
attendance
the
irishman
accepting
his
ministrations
without
resentment
almost
with
indifference
i
shall
be
on
deck
between
two
and
three
in
the
morning
to
see
the
comet
the
german
observed
to
him
casually
toward
evening
as
they
met
on
the
bridge
we
may
meet
perhaps
all
right
doctor
it
more
than
possible
replied
realizing
how
closely
he
was
being
watched
in
his
mind
at
the
moment
another
sentence
ran
the
thought
growing
stronger
and
stronger
within
him
as
the
day
declined
it
will
come
tonight
come
as
an
inner
catastrophe
not
unlike
that
of
death
i
shall
hear
the
call
to
escape
for
he
knew
as
well
as
if
it
had
been
told
to
him
in
so
many
words
that
the
sleep
of
his
two
companions
all
day
was
in
the
nature
of
a
preparation
the
fluid
projections
of
themselves
were
all
the
time
active
elsewhere
their
bodies
heavily
slumbered
their
spirits
were
out
and
alert
summoned
forth
by
those
strange
and
radiant
evocative
forces
that
even
in
the
dullest
minds
greece
stirs
into
life
they
had
temporarily
escaped
again
he
saw
those
shapes
of
cloud
and
wind
moving
with
swift
freedom
over
the
long
bare
hills
again
and
again
the
image
returned
with
the
night
a
similar
separation
of
the
personality
might
come
to
himself
too
stahl
warning
passed
in
letters
of
fire
across
his
inner
sight
with
a
relief
that
yet
contained
uneasiness
he
watched
his
shambling
figure
disappear
down
the
stairway
he
was
alone
xx
to
everything
that
a
man
does
he
must
give
his
undivided
attention
or
his
ego
when
he
has
done
this
thoughts
soon
arise
in
him
or
else
a
new
method
of
apprehension
miraculously
appears
very
remarkable
it
is
that
through
this
play
of
his
personality
man
first
becomes
aware
of
his
specific
freedom
and
that
it
seems
to
him
as
though
he
awaked
out
of
a
deep
sleep
as
though
he
were
only
now
at
home
in
the
world
and
as
if
the
light
of
day
were
breaking
now
over
his
interior
life
for
the
first
time
the
substance
of
these
impressions
which
affect
us
we
call
nature
and
thus
nature
stands
in
an
immediate
relationship
to
those
functions
of
our
bodies
which
we
call
senses
unknown
and
mysterious
relations
of
our
body
allow
us
to
surmise
unknown
and
mysterious
correlations
with
nature
and
therefore
nature
is
that
wondrous
fellowship
into
which
our
bodies
introduce
us
and
which
we
learn
to
know
through
the
mode
of
its
constitutions
and
abilities
novalis
at
translated
by
and
so
at
last
the
darkness
came
a
starry
darkness
of
soft
blue
shadows
and
phosphorescent
sea
out
of
which
the
hills
of
the
cyclades
rose
faint
as
pictures
of
floating
smoke
a
wind
might
waft
away
like
flowers
to
the
sky
the
plains
of
marathon
lay
far
astern
blushing
faintly
with
their
scarlet
tamarisk
blossoms
the
strange
purple
glow
of
sunset
upon
hymettus
had
long
since
faded
a
hush
grew
over
the
sea
now
a
marvelous
cobalt
blue
the
earth
gently
sleeping
manifested
dreamily
into
the
subconscious
state
passed
one
half
of
her
huge
gentle
life
the
irishman
responding
to
the
eternal
spell
of
her
experienced
in
quite
a
new
way
the
magic
of
her
he
found
it
more
difficult
than
ever
to
realize
as
separate
entities
the
little
things
that
moved
about
through
the
upper
surface
of
her
darkness
wings
of
silver
powerfully
whirring
swept
his
soul
onwards
to
another
place
toward
home
and
the
two
worlds
intermingled
oddly
these
little
separate
outer
things
going
to
and
fro
so
busily
became
as
symbols
more
or
less
vital
more
or
less
transparent
they
varied
according
to
their
simplicity
some
of
them
were
channels
that
led
directly
where
he
was
going
others
again
had
lost
all
connection
with
their
vital
source
and
center
of
existence
to
the
former
belonged
the
sailors
children
the
tired
birds
that
rested
on
the
ship
as
they
journeyed
northwards
swallows
doves
and
little
travelers
with
breasts
of
spotted
yellow
that
nested
in
the
rigging
even
in
a
measure
the
gentle
priest
but
to
the
latter
the
noisy
vulgar
tourists
and
especially
the
stahl
interpreter
and
intermediary
hovered
between
incarnate
compromise
escaping
from
everybody
at
length
he
made
his
way
into
the
bows
there
covered
by
the
stars
he
waited
and
the
thing
he
waited
for
he
felt
it
coming
over
him
with
a
kind
of
massive
sensation
as
little
local
as
heat
or
cold
was
that
disentanglement
of
a
part
of
his
personality
from
the
rest
against
which
stahl
had
warned
him
that
portion
of
his
complex
personality
in
which
resided
desire
and
longing
matured
during
these
many
years
of
poignant
nostalgia
was
now
slowly
and
deliberately
loosening
out
from
the
parent
center
it
was
the
vehicle
of
his
yearnings
and
the
was
about
to
draw
it
forth
the
call
was
on
its
way
hereabouts
then
near
the
isles
of
greece
lay
a
channel
to
the
far
youth
a
channel
for
some
reason
still
unclosed
his
companions
knew
it
he
too
had
half
divined
it
the
increased
psychic
activity
of
all
three
as
they
approached
greece
seemed
explained
the
sign
would
it
be
through
hearing
sight
or
touch
would
shortly
come
that
should
convince
that
very
afternoon
stahl
had
said
greece
will
betray
them
and
he
had
asked
their
true
form
and
type
and
for
answer
the
old
man
did
an
expressive
thing
far
more
convincing
than
words
he
bent
forwards
and
downwards
he
made
as
though
to
move
a
moment
on
all
fours
remembered
the
brief
and
vital
scene
now
the
word
however
persistently
refused
to
come
into
his
mind
because
the
word
was
really
inadequate
describing
but
partially
a
form
and
outline
symbolical
of
far
more
a
measure
of
nature
and
deity
alike
and
so
as
a
man
dreading
the
entrance
to
a
great
adventure
that
he
yet
desires
the
irishman
waited
there
alone
beneath
the
cloud
of
night
soft
threads
of
trailing
the
sea
wove
with
the
darkness
a
veil
that
hid
from
his
eyes
the
world
of
crude
effects
all
memory
of
the
casual
realities
of
modern
life
that
so
distressed
his
soul
fled
far
away
the
archetypal
world
soul
of
the
earth
swam
close
about
him
enormous
and
utterly
simple
he
seemed
alone
in
some
hollow
of
the
night
which
time
had
overlooked
and
where
the
powers
of
sea
and
air
held
him
in
the
stretch
of
their
gigantic
changeless
hands
in
this
hollow
lay
the
entrance
to
the
channel
down
which
he
presently
might
flash
back
to
that
primal
garden
of
the
earth
first
beauty
her
golden
age
down
which
at
any
rate
the
authoritative
call
he
awaited
was
to
come
oh
what
a
power
has
white
simplicity
wings
from
the
past
serene
and
tranquil
bore
him
toward
this
ancient
peace
where
echoes
of
life
brazen
clash
today
could
never
enter
ages
before
greece
of
course
it
had
flourished
yet
greece
had
caught
some
flying
remnant
ere
it
left
the
world
of
men
and
for
a
period
had
striven
to
renew
its
life
though
by
poetry
but
half
believed
over
the
vales
and
hills
of
hellas
this
mood
had
lingered
bravely
for
a
while
then
passed
away
forever
and
those
who
dreamed
of
its
remembrance
remain
homeless
and
lonely
seeking
it
ever
again
in
vain
lost
citizens
rejected
by
the
cycles
of
vainer
life
and
action
that
succeeded
the
spirit
of
the
earth
yes
whispered
in
his
ears
as
he
waited
covered
by
the
night
and
stars
she
called
him
as
though
across
all
the
forests
on
her
breast
the
long
sweet
winds
went
whispering
his
name
lying
there
upon
the
coils
of
thick
and
tarry
rope
the
caught
him
back
with
her
splendid
passion
currents
of
earth
life
gentle
as
the
hands
of
little
children
tugged
softly
at
this
loosening
portion
of
his
self
urging
his
very
lips
as
it
were
once
more
to
the
mighty
mother
breasts
again
he
saw
those
shapes
careering
over
long
bare
hills
and
almost
knew
himself
among
them
as
they
raced
with
streaming
winds
free
ancient
comrades
among
whom
he
was
no
longer
alien
and
outcast
including
his
two
companions
of
the
steamer
the
early
memory
of
the
earth
became
his
own
as
a
part
of
her
he
shared
it
too
the
closed
magnificently
about
him
vast
shapes
of
power
and
beauty
other
than
human
once
his
comrades
thus
but
since
withdrawn
because
denied
by
a
pettier
age
moved
up
huge
and
dim
across
the
sham
barriers
of
time
and
space
singing
the
great
of
welcome
in
his
ears
the
whisper
grew
awfully
the
spirit
of
the
earth
flew
close
and
called
upon
him
with
a
shout
then
out
of
this
amazing
reverie
he
woke
abruptly
to
the
consciousness
that
some
one
was
approaching
him
stealthily
yet
with
speed
through
the
darkness
with
a
start
he
sat
up
peering
about
him
there
was
dew
on
his
clothes
and
hair
the
stars
he
saw
had
shifted
their
positions
he
heard
the
surge
of
the
water
from
the
vessel
bows
below
the
line
of
the
shore
lay
close
on
either
side
overhead
he
saw
the
black
threads
of
rigging
quivering
with
the
movement
of
the
ship
the
swaying
light
the
dim
round
funnels
the
confused
shadows
where
the
boats
swung
and
nearer
moving
between
the
ropes
and
windlasses
this
hurrying
figure
whose
approach
had
disturbed
him
in
his
gorgeous
dream
and
divined
at
once
that
though
in
one
sense
a
portion
of
his
dream
it
belonged
outwardly
to
the
same
world
as
this
long
dark
steamer
that
trailed
after
him
across
the
sea
a
piece
of
his
vision
as
it
were
had
broken
off
and
remained
in
the
cruder
world
wherein
his
body
lay
upon
these
tarry
ropes
the
boy
came
up
and
stood
a
moment
by
his
side
in
silence
then
stooping
to
the
level
of
his
head
he
spoke
come
he
said
in
low
tones
of
joy
come
we
wait
long
for
you
already
the
words
like
music
floated
over
the
sea
as
took
the
outstretched
hand
and
suffered
himself
to
be
led
quickly
toward
the
lower
deck
he
walked
at
first
as
in
a
dream
continued
after
waking
more
than
once
it
seemed
as
though
they
stepped
together
from
the
boards
and
moved
through
space
toward
the
line
of
peaked
hills
that
fringed
the
steamer
course
so
close
for
through
the
salt
night
air
ran
a
perfume
that
suggested
flowers
earth
and
woods
and
there
seemed
no
break
in
the
platforms
of
darkness
that
knit
sea
and
shore
to
the
very
substance
of
the
vessel
xxi
the
lights
in
the
saloon
were
out
the
empty
the
passengers
in
bed
the
ship
seemed
entirely
deserted
only
on
the
bridge
the
shadow
of
the
first
officer
paced
quietly
to
and
fro
then
suddenly
as
they
approached
the
stern
discerned
anther
figure
huge
and
motionless
against
the
background
of
phosphorescent
foam
and
at
the
first
glance
it
was
exactly
as
though
he
had
detached
from
the
background
of
his
mind
one
of
those
flying
outlines
upon
the
hills
and
caught
it
there
arrested
visibly
at
last
he
moved
along
fairly
sure
of
himself
yet
with
a
tumult
of
confused
sensations
as
if
consciousness
were
transferring
itself
now
more
rapidly
to
that
portion
of
him
which
sought
to
escape
leaning
forward
in
a
stooping
posture
over
the
bulwarks
wrapped
in
the
flowing
cape
he
sometimes
wore
the
man
back
and
shoulders
married
so
intimately
with
the
night
that
it
was
hard
to
determine
the
dividing
line
between
the
two
so
much
more
of
the
deck
behind
him
and
of
the
sky
immediately
beyond
his
neck
was
obliterated
than
by
any
possible
human
outline
whether
owing
to
obliquity
of
disturbed
vision
tricks
of
shadow
or
movement
of
the
vessel
between
the
stars
and
foam
the
irishman
saw
these
singular
emanations
spread
about
him
into
space
he
saw
them
this
time
directly
and
more
than
ever
before
they
seemed
in
some
way
right
and
comely
true
they
were
in
no
sense
monstrous
they
reported
beauty
though
a
beauty
cloaked
in
power
and
watching
him
felt
that
this
loosening
portion
of
himself
as
once
before
in
the
little
cabin
likewise
began
to
grow
and
spread
within
some
ancient
fold
of
the
earth
they
both
lay
caught
in
some
mighty
dream
of
her
planetary
spirit
dim
immense
they
played
their
parts
of
wonder
already
they
lay
close
enough
to
share
the
currents
of
her
subconscious
activities
and
the
dream
as
she
turned
in
her
vast
spatial
sleep
was
a
dream
of
a
time
long
gone
here
amid
the
loneliness
of
deserted
deck
and
night
this
illusion
of
bulk
was
more
than
ever
before
outwardly
impressive
and
as
he
yielded
to
the
persuasion
of
the
boy
hand
he
was
conscious
of
a
sudden
wild
inclination
to
use
his
own
arms
and
legs
in
a
way
he
had
never
before
known
or
dreamed
of
yet
that
seemed
curiously
familiar
the
balance
and
adjustment
of
his
physical
frame
sought
to
shift
and
alter
neck
and
shoulders
as
it
were
urged
forward
there
came
a
singular
pricking
in
the
loins
a
rising
of
the
back
a
thrusting
up
and
outwards
of
the
chest
he
felt
that
something
grew
behind
him
with
a
power
that
sought
to
impel
or
drive
him
in
advance
and
out
across
the
world
at
a
terrific
gait
and
the
hearing
of
his
ears
became
of
a
sudden
intensely
acute
while
his
body
moved
ordinarily
he
knew
that
a
part
of
him
that
was
not
body
moved
otherwise
that
he
neither
walked
ran
nor
stepped
upon
two
feet
but
galloped
the
motion
proclaimed
him
kin
with
the
flying
shapes
upon
the
hills
at
the
heart
of
this
portion
which
sought
to
detach
itself
from
his
central
personality
which
indeed
seemed
already
half
escaped
he
cantered
the
experience
lasted
but
a
second
this
swift
free
motion
of
the
escaping
double
then
passed
away
like
those
flashes
of
memory
that
rise
and
vanish
again
before
they
can
be
seized
for
examination
he
shook
himself
free
of
the
unaccountable
obsession
and
with
the
effort
of
returning
to
the
actual
present
the
was
temporarily
checked
and
it
was
then
just
as
he
held
himself
in
hand
again
that
glancing
sideways
he
became
aware
that
the
boy
beside
him
had
like
his
parent
also
changed
grown
large
and
shadowy
with
a
similar
suggestion
of
another
splendid
outline
the
extension
already
half
accomplished
in
himself
and
fully
accomplished
in
the
father
was
in
process
of
accomplishment
in
the
smaller
figure
of
the
son
clothed
in
the
emerged
true
shape
of
their
inner
being
they
slowly
revealed
themselves
it
was
as
bewildering
as
watching
death
and
as
stern
and
beautiful
for
the
boy
still
holding
his
hand
loped
along
beside
him
as
though
the
projection
that
emanated
from
him
grown
almost
physical
were
somehow
difficult
to
manage
in
the
moment
of
nearer
smaller
consciousness
that
yet
remained
to
him
recalled
the
significant
pantomime
of
stahl
two
days
before
in
the
cabin
it
came
with
a
rush
of
fire
the
warning
operated
his
caution
instantly
worked
he
dropped
the
hand
let
the
clinging
fingers
slip
from
his
own
overcome
by
something
that
appalled
for
this
surely
was
the
inner
catastrophe
that
he
dreaded
the
radical
internal
dislocation
of
his
personality
that
involved
death
the
thing
that
had
happened
or
was
happening
to
these
other
two
was
on
the
edge
of
fulfillment
in
himself
before
he
was
either
ready
or
had
decided
to
accept
it
at
any
rate
he
hesitated
and
the
hesitation
shifting
his
center
of
consciousness
back
into
his
brain
checked
and
saved
him
a
confused
sense
of
forces
settling
back
within
himself
followed
a
kind
of
rush
and
scuttle
of
moods
and
powers
and
he
remained
temporarily
master
of
his
being
recovering
balance
and
command
twice
already
in
that
as
also
on
the
deck
when
stahl
had
seized
him
the
moment
had
come
close
now
again
had
he
kept
hold
of
the
grasp
that
inner
transformation
which
should
later
become
externalized
must
have
completed
itself
no
no
he
tried
to
cry
aloud
for
i
not
yet
ready
but
his
voice
rose
scarcely
above
a
whisper
the
decision
of
his
will
however
had
produced
the
desired
result
the
illusion
so
strangely
born
had
passed
at
any
rate
for
the
time
he
knew
once
more
the
glory
of
the
steadfast
stars
realized
that
he
walked
normally
upon
a
steamer
deck
heard
with
welcome
the
surge
of
the
sea
below
and
felt
the
peace
of
this
calm
southern
night
as
they
coasted
with
two
hundred
sleeping
tourists
between
the
islands
and
the
grecian
mainland
he
remembered
the
the
armenian
priest
the
canadian
drummer
it
seemed
his
feet
half
tripped
or
at
least
that
he
put
out
a
hand
to
steady
himself
against
the
ship
long
roll
for
the
pair
of
them
moved
up
to
the
big
man
side
with
a
curious
rushing
motion
that
brought
them
all
together
with
a
mild
collision
and
the
boy
laughed
merrily
his
laughter
like
singing
half
completed
remembers
the
little
detail
because
it
serves
to
show
that
he
was
yet
still
in
a
state
of
intensified
consciousness
far
above
the
normal
level
it
was
still
like
walking
in
my
sleep
or
acting
out
some
splendid
dream
as
he
put
it
in
his
written
version
half
out
of
my
body
if
you
like
though
in
no
sense
of
the
words
at
all
half
out
of
my
mind
xxii
what
followed
he
relates
with
passion
half
confused
without
speaking
the
big
russian
turned
his
head
by
way
of
welcome
and
saw
that
the
proportions
of
it
were
magnificent
like
a
fragment
of
the
night
and
sky
though
too
dark
to
read
the
actual
expression
in
the
eyes
he
detected
their
gleam
of
joy
and
splendor
the
whole
presentment
of
the
man
was
impressive
beyond
any
words
that
he
could
find
massive
yet
charged
with
swift
and
alert
vitality
he
reared
there
through
the
night
his
inner
self
now
toweringly
manifested
at
any
other
time
and
without
the
preparation
already
undergone
the
sight
might
almost
have
terrified
now
it
only
uplifted
for
in
similar
fashion
though
lesser
in
degree
because
the
mold
was
smaller
and
hesitation
checked
it
this
very
transformation
had
been
going
forward
within
himself
the
three
of
them
leaned
there
upon
the
rails
rails
oddly
dwindled
now
to
the
size
of
a
toy
steamer
while
thus
the
spirit
of
the
dreaming
earth
swam
round
and
through
them
awful
in
power
yet
at
the
same
time
gentle
winning
seductive
as
wild
flowers
in
the
spring
and
it
was
this
delicate
touch
of
delight
magical
with
a
supreme
and
utterly
simple
innocence
that
made
the
grandeur
of
the
whole
experience
still
easily
manageable
and
terror
in
it
all
unknown
the
irishman
stood
on
the
outside
toward
the
vessel
stern
next
him
the
father
beyond
the
boy
they
touched
a
current
like
a
river
in
flood
swept
through
all
three
he
too
was
caught
within
those
visible
extensions
of
their
personalities
all
again
caught
within
the
consciousness
of
the
earth
across
the
sea
they
gazed
together
in
silence
waiting
it
was
the
oro
passage
where
the
mainland
hills
on
the
west
and
the
isle
of
tenos
on
the
east
draw
close
together
and
the
steamer
passes
for
several
miles
so
near
to
greece
that
the
boom
of
surf
upon
the
shore
is
audible
that
night
however
the
sea
lay
too
still
for
surf
it
whispered
softly
in
its
sleep
and
in
its
sleep
too
listened
they
heard
its
multitudinous
rush
of
voices
as
the
surge
below
raced
by
a
giant
frieze
in
which
the
phosphorescence
painted
dancing
forms
and
palely
luminous
faces
unsubstantial
shapes
of
foam
held
hands
in
continuous
array
below
the
waves
lit
by
strung
together
along
the
steamer
sides
yet
it
was
not
these
glimmering
shapes
the
three
of
them
watched
thus
intently
silent
the
lens
of
yearning
focused
not
in
sight
down
the
great
channel
at
whose
opening
they
stood
leading
straight
to
the
earth
old
central
heart
the
message
of
communion
would
not
be
a
visual
one
the
sensitive
fringe
of
their
stretched
personalities
contacting
thus
actually
the
consciousness
of
the
would
quiver
to
a
reaction
of
another
kind
this
point
of
union
already
affected
would
presently
report
itself
unmistakably
yet
not
to
the
eyes
the
increased
acuteness
of
the
irishman
hearing
a
kind
of
interior
hearing
quickly
supplied
the
key
it
was
that
all
three
listened
some
primitive
sound
of
earth
would
presently
vibrate
through
their
extended
beings
with
an
authoritative
sweet
thunder
not
to
be
denied
by
a
voice
a
call
the
earth
would
tell
them
that
she
heard
that
lovingly
she
was
aware
of
their
presence
in
her
heart
she
would
call
them
with
the
voice
of
of
their
own
how
strange
it
all
was
enormous
in
conception
enormous
in
distance
scope
stretch
yet
so
tiny
intimate
sweet
and
this
vast
splendor
was
to
report
itself
by
one
of
the
insignificant
little
channels
by
which
men
locked
in
cramped
physical
bodies
interpret
the
giant
universe
a
trivial
that
so
terrible
a
communication
could
reach
the
soul
via
the
quivering
of
a
wee
material
nerve
was
on
a
par
with
that
other
grave
splendor
that
god
can
exist
in
the
heart
of
a
child
thus
dimly
yet
with
an
authority
that
shakes
the
soul
may
little
human
hearts
divine
the
immensities
that
travel
with
a
thunder
of
great
glory
close
about
their
daily
life
through
regions
of
their
subliminal
consciousness
which
transcends
the
restricted
physical
expression
of
it
called
personality
as
the
moisture
of
the
world
transcends
a
drop
of
water
deific
presences
pass
grandly
to
and
fro
for
here
to
this
irishman
with
the
forbidden
strain
of
the
in
his
blood
came
the
sharp
and
instant
revelation
that
the
consciousness
is
not
contained
around
the
body
it
spread
enormously
about
him
remote
extended
and
in
some
distant
tract
of
it
this
strange
occurrence
took
place
the
idea
of
distance
and
extension
of
course
were
merely
intellectual
concepts
like
that
of
time
for
what
happened
happened
near
and
close
beside
his
actual
physical
person
that
physical
person
with
its
brain
however
he
realized
was
but
a
fragment
of
his
total
self
a
broken
piece
of
the
occurrence
filtered
through
from
beyond
and
fell
upon
the
deck
at
his
feet
the
rest
he
divined
seeing
it
whole
only
the
little
bit
however
has
he
found
the
language
to
describe
and
that
for
which
all
three
listened
was
already
on
the
way
forever
it
had
been
happening
yet
only
reached
them
now
because
they
were
ready
and
open
to
it
events
upon
the
physical
plane
he
grasped
represented
the
last
feeble
expression
of
things
that
had
happened
interiorly
with
a
vaster
power
long
ago
and
are
ever
happening
still
this
sound
they
listened
for
coming
from
the
spirit
of
the
earth
lay
ever
close
to
men
ears
divinely
sweet
and
splendid
it
seemed
born
somewhere
in
the
heart
of
the
blue
gloom
that
draped
the
hills
of
greece
thence
across
the
peaked
mountains
stretched
the
immense
pipe
of
starry
darkness
that
carried
it
toward
them
as
along
a
channel
made
possible
of
approach
by
the
ancient
passion
of
beauty
that
greece
once
knew
it
ran
down
upon
the
world
into
their
hearts
direct
from
the
being
of
the
earth
with
a
sudden
rush
it
grew
nearer
swelling
with
a
draught
of
sound
that
sucked
whole
spaces
of
sky
and
sea
and
stars
with
it
it
emerged
they
heard
all
three
above
the
pulse
and
tremble
of
the
steamer
engines
above
the
surge
and
gurgle
of
the
sea
a
cry
swept
toward
them
from
the
shore
yet
with
some
strident
accent
of
power
and
command
this
voice
of
earth
rushed
upon
them
over
the
quiet
water
then
died
away
again
among
the
mountains
and
the
night
its
passage
through
the
sky
was
torrential
the
whole
pouring
flood
of
it
dipped
back
with
abrupt
swiftness
into
silence
the
irishman
understood
that
but
an
echo
of
its
main
volume
had
come
through
a
deep
convulsive
movement
ran
over
the
great
body
at
his
side
and
at
once
communicated
itself
to
the
boy
beyond
father
and
son
straightened
up
abruptly
as
though
the
same
force
lifted
both
then
stretched
down
and
forwards
over
the
bulwarks
they
seemed
to
shake
themselves
free
of
something
neither
spoke
something
utterly
overwhelming
lay
in
that
moment
for
the
cry
was
at
once
of
enchanting
sweetness
yet
with
a
deep
and
dreadful
authority
that
overpowered
it
invited
the
very
soul
a
moment
of
silence
followed
and
the
cry
was
then
repeated
thinner
fainter
already
further
away
it
seemed
withdrawn
sunk
more
deeply
into
the
night
higher
up
too
floating
away
northwards
into
remoter
vales
and
glens
that
lay
beyond
the
though
still
a
single
cry
there
were
distinct
breaks
of
utterance
in
it
this
time
as
of
words
it
was
of
a
kind
speech
a
message
a
summons
a
command
that
somehow
held
entreaty
at
its
heart
and
this
time
the
appeal
in
it
was
irresistible
father
and
son
started
forwards
as
though
deliberately
pulled
while
from
himself
shot
outwards
that
loosening
portion
of
his
being
that
all
the
evening
had
sought
release
the
vehicle
of
his
yearnings
passionately
summoned
leaped
to
the
ancient
call
of
the
earth
eternally
young
life
this
vital
essence
of
his
personality
volatile
as
air
and
fierce
as
lightning
flashed
outwards
from
its
hidden
prison
where
it
lay
choked
and
smothered
by
the
weights
and
measures
of
modern
life
for
the
beauty
and
splendor
of
that
far
voice
wrung
his
very
heart
and
set
it
free
he
knew
a
wrench
of
detachment
a
wild
and
tameless
glory
fused
the
fastenings
of
ages
only
the
motionless
solidity
of
the
great
figure
beside
him
prevented
somehow
the
complete
escape
and
made
him
understand
that
the
call
just
then
was
not
for
all
three
of
them
especially
not
for
himself
the
parent
rose
beside
him
massive
and
stable
secure
as
the
hills
which
were
his
true
home
and
the
boy
broke
suddenly
into
happy
speech
which
was
wild
and
singing
he
looked
up
swiftly
into
his
parent
steady
visage
father
he
cried
in
tones
that
merged
half
with
the
wind
half
with
the
sea
it
is
his
voice
chiron
calls
his
eyes
shone
like
stars
his
young
face
was
alight
with
joy
and
go
father
or
he
stopped
an
instant
catching
the
irishman
eyes
upon
his
own
across
the
form
between
or
you
he
added
with
a
laughter
of
delight
go
the
big
figure
straightened
up
standing
back
a
pace
from
the
rails
a
low
sound
rolled
from
him
that
was
like
an
echo
of
thunder
among
hills
with
slow
laborious
distinctness
it
broke
off
into
fragments
that
were
words
with
great
difficulty
uttered
but
with
a
final
authority
that
rendered
them
command
no
heard
you
first
and
carry
word
that
we
are
on
the
way
staring
out
across
the
sea
and
sky
he
boomed
it
deeply
you
first
we
follow
and
the
speech
seemed
to
flow
from
the
entire
surface
of
his
body
rather
than
from
the
lips
alone
the
sea
and
air
mothered
the
syllables
thus
might
the
night
herself
have
spoken
the
word
with
its
clue
of
explanation
flamed
about
him
with
a
roar
was
this
then
the
type
of
cosmic
life
to
which
his
companions
and
himself
with
them
inwardly
approximated
the
same
instant
before
could
move
a
muscle
to
prevent
it
the
boy
climbed
the
rails
with
an
easy
vaulting
motion
that
was
swift
yet
oddly
spread
and
dropped
straight
down
into
the
sea
he
fell
and
as
he
fell
it
was
as
if
the
passage
through
the
air
drew
out
a
part
of
him
again
like
smoke
whether
it
was
due
to
the
flying
cloak
or
to
some
dim
wizardry
of
the
shadows
there
grew
over
him
an
instantaneous
transformation
of
outline
that
was
far
more
marked
than
anything
before
for
as
the
steamer
drew
onwards
and
the
body
thus
passed
in
its
downward
flight
close
beneath
eyes
he
saw
that
the
boy
was
making
the
first
preparatory
motions
of
swimming
movements
however
that
were
not
the
horizontal
sweep
of
a
pair
of
human
arms
but
rather
the
vertical
strokes
of
a
swimming
animal
he
pawed
the
air
the
surprise
of
the
whole
unexpected
thing
came
upon
him
with
a
crash
that
brought
him
back
effectually
again
into
himself
that
part
of
him
already
half
emerged
in
similar
escape
now
flashed
back
within
him
the
inner
catastrophe
he
dreaded
while
desiring
it
had
not
yet
completed
itself
he
heard
no
splash
for
the
ship
was
high
out
of
the
water
and
the
place
where
the
body
met
the
sea
already
lay
far
astern
but
when
the
momentary
arrest
of
his
faculties
had
passed
and
he
found
his
voice
to
cry
for
help
the
father
turned
upon
him
like
a
lion
and
clapped
a
great
encompassing
hand
upon
his
mouth
quiet
his
deep
voice
boomed
it
is
well
and
he
is
safe
and
across
the
huge
and
simple
visage
ran
an
expression
of
such
supreme
happiness
while
in
his
act
and
gesture
lay
such
convincing
power
that
the
irishman
felt
himself
overborne
and
forced
to
acknowledge
another
standard
of
authority
that
somehow
made
the
whole
thing
right
to
cry
man
overboard
to
stop
the
ship
throw
and
the
rest
was
not
only
unnecessary
but
foolish
the
boy
was
safe
it
was
well
with
him
he
was
not
lost
see
said
the
parent
deep
voice
breaking
in
upon
his
thoughts
as
he
drew
him
to
one
side
with
a
certain
vehemence
see
he
pointed
downwards
and
there
between
them
half
in
the
scuppers
against
their
very
feet
lay
the
huddled
body
upon
the
deck
the
arms
outstretched
the
face
turned
upwards
to
the
stars
the
bewilderment
that
followed
was
like
the
confusion
which
exists
between
two
states
of
consciousness
when
the
mind
passes
from
sleep
to
waking
or
lost
that
power
of
attention
which
enables
a
man
to
concentrate
on
details
sufficiently
to
recall
their
exact
sequence
afterwards
with
certainty
two
things
however
stood
out
and
he
tells
them
briefly
enough
first
that
the
joy
upon
the
father
face
rendered
an
offer
of
sympathy
ludicrous
secondly
that
stahl
was
again
upon
the
scene
with
a
promptness
which
proved
him
to
have
been
close
at
hand
all
the
time
it
was
between
two
and
three
in
the
morning
the
rest
of
the
passengers
asleep
still
but
captain
burgenfelder
and
the
first
officer
appeared
soon
after
and
an
orderly
record
of
the
affair
was
drawn
up
formally
the
depositions
of
the
father
and
of
himself
were
duly
taken
down
in
writing
witnessed
and
all
the
rest
the
scene
in
the
doctor
cabin
remains
vividly
in
his
mind
the
huge
russian
standing
by
the
door
for
he
refused
a
seat
incongruously
smiling
in
contrast
to
the
general
gravity
his
mind
obviously
brought
by
an
effort
of
concentration
to
each
question
the
others
seated
round
the
desk
some
distance
away
leaving
him
in
a
space
by
himself
the
scratching
of
the
doctor
pointed
pen
the
still
young
outline
underneath
the
canvas
all
through
the
long
pantomime
lying
upon
a
couch
at
the
back
where
the
shadows
gathered
thickly
and
then
the
gust
of
fresh
wind
that
came
in
with
a
little
song
as
they
opened
the
door
at
the
end
and
saw
the
crimson
dawn
reflected
in
the
dewy
shining
boards
of
the
deck
the
father
throwing
the
irishman
a
significant
and
curious
glance
was
out
to
join
it
on
the
instant
syncope
produced
by
excitement
cause
unknown
was
the
scientific
verdict
and
an
immediate
burial
at
sea
the
parent
wish
as
the
sun
rose
over
the
highlands
of
asia
minor
it
was
carried
into
effect
but
the
father
eyes
followed
not
the
drop
they
gazed
with
rapt
intent
expression
in
another
direction
where
the
shafts
of
sunrise
sped
across
the
sea
toward
the
glens
and
dales
of
distant
pelion
at
the
sound
of
the
plunge
he
did
not
even
turn
his
eyes
he
pointed
gathering
somehow
into
the
gesture
across
the
ægean
sea
to
where
the
shores
of
arcadia
lay
below
the
horizon
raised
his
arms
with
a
huge
sweep
of
welcome
to
the
brightening
sky
then
turned
and
went
below
without
a
single
word
for
a
few
minutes
puzzled
and
perhaps
a
little
awed
the
group
of
sailors
and
ship
officers
remained
standing
with
bared
heads
then
disappeared
silently
in
their
turn
leaving
the
decks
to
the
sunrise
and
the
wind
xxiii
but
did
not
immediately
return
to
his
own
cabin
he
yielded
to
stahl
persuasion
and
dropped
into
the
armchair
he
had
already
occupied
more
than
once
watching
his
companion
preparations
with
the
lamp
and
coffeepot
with
his
eyes
that
is
he
watched
staring
as
men
say
for
the
fact
was
only
a
little
bit
of
him
hovered
there
about
his
weary
physical
frame
the
rest
of
him
was
off
somewhere
else
across
the
threshold
subliminal
below
with
the
russian
beyond
with
the
traveling
spirit
of
the
boy
but
the
major
portion
out
deep
in
space
reclaimed
by
the
earth
so
at
least
it
felt
for
the
circulation
of
blood
in
his
brain
ran
low
and
physical
sensation
there
was
almost
none
the
driving
impulse
upon
the
outlying
tracts
of
consciousness
usually
submerged
had
been
tremendous
that
time
he
heard
stahl
saying
in
an
oddly
distant
voice
from
across
the
cabin
you
were
nearly
out
you
heard
you
saw
it
all
he
murmured
as
in
for
it
was
an
effort
to
focus
his
mind
even
upon
simple
words
the
reply
he
hardly
caught
though
he
felt
the
significant
stare
of
the
man
eye
upon
him
and
divined
the
shaking
of
his
head
his
life
still
pulsed
and
throbbed
far
away
outside
his
normal
self
complete
return
was
difficult
he
felt
all
over
with
the
wind
and
hills
and
sea
all
his
little
personal
sensations
tucked
away
and
absorbed
into
nature
in
the
earth
he
lay
pervading
her
whole
surface
still
sharing
her
vaster
life
with
her
he
moved
as
with
a
greater
higher
and
more
harmonious
creation
than
himself
in
large
measure
the
cosmic
instincts
still
swept
these
quickened
fringes
of
his
deep
subconscious
personality
you
know
them
now
for
what
they
are
he
heard
the
doctor
saying
at
the
end
of
much
else
he
had
entirely
missed
the
father
will
be
the
next
to
go
and
then
yourself
i
warn
you
before
it
is
too
late
beware
and
resist
his
thoughts
and
with
them
those
subtle
energies
of
the
soul
that
are
the
vehicles
of
thought
followed
where
the
boy
had
gone
deep
streams
of
longing
swept
him
the
journey
of
that
spirit
so
singularly
released
drew
half
his
forces
after
it
thither
the
bereaved
parent
and
himself
were
also
bound
and
the
lonely
incompleteness
of
his
life
lay
wholly
now
explained
that
cry
within
the
dawn
though
actually
it
had
been
calling
always
had
at
last
reached
him
hitherto
he
had
caught
only
misinterpreted
echoes
of
it
from
the
narrow
body
it
had
called
him
forth
another
moment
and
he
would
have
known
complete
emancipation
and
never
could
he
forget
that
glorious
sensation
as
the
vital
essence
tasted
half
release
next
time
the
process
should
complete
itself
and
he
would
go
drink
this
he
heard
abruptly
in
stahl
grating
voice
and
saw
him
cross
the
cabin
with
a
cup
of
steaming
coffee
concentrate
your
mind
now
upon
the
things
about
you
here
return
to
the
present
and
tell
me
too
if
you
can
bring
yourself
to
do
so
he
added
stooping
over
him
with
the
cup
a
little
of
what
you
experienced
the
return
i
know
is
pain
but
try
try
like
a
little
bit
of
death
yes
murmured
the
irishman
i
feel
caught
again
and
caged
small
he
could
have
wept
this
ugly
little
life
because
you
tasted
a
moment
of
genuine
cosmic
consciousness
and
now
you
feel
the
limitations
of
normal
personality
stahl
added
more
soothingly
he
sat
down
beside
him
and
sipped
his
own
coffee
dispersed
about
the
whole
earth
i
felt
deliciously
extended
and
alive
whispered
with
a
faint
shiver
as
he
glanced
about
the
little
cabin
noticing
the
small
windows
and
shut
door
upholstery
oppressed
him
now
i
back
in
prison
again
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
then
presently
the
doctor
spoke
as
though
he
thought
aloud
expecting
no
reply
all
great
emotions
he
said
in
lowered
tones
tap
the
extensions
of
the
personality
we
now
call
subconscious
and
a
man
in
anger
in
love
in
ecstasy
of
any
kind
is
greater
than
he
knows
but
to
you
has
come
perhaps
the
greatest
form
of
all
a
definite
and
instant
merging
with
the
being
of
the
earth
herself
you
reached
the
point
where
you
the
spirit
of
the
planet
life
you
almost
crossed
the
threshold
your
extension
edged
into
her
own
she
bruised
you
and
you
knew
he
asked
startled
at
the
singular
expression
into
closer
hearing
we
are
not
of
our
interior
he
answered
smiling
a
little
until
something
goes
wrong
and
the
attention
is
focused
a
keen
sensation
pain
and
you
become
aware
subconscious
processes
then
become
consciously
recognized
i
bruise
your
lung
for
instance
you
become
conscious
of
that
lung
for
the
first
time
and
feel
it
you
gather
it
up
from
the
general
subconscious
background
into
acute
personal
consciousness
similarly
a
word
or
mood
may
sting
and
stimulate
some
phase
of
your
consciousness
usually
too
remote
to
be
recognized
last
night
regions
of
your
extended
self
too
distant
for
most
men
to
realize
their
existence
at
all
contacted
the
consciousness
of
the
earth
herself
she
bruised
you
and
that
bruise
caught
you
up
into
her
greater
self
you
experienced
a
genuine
cosmic
reaction
listened
though
hardly
to
the
actual
words
behind
the
speech
which
was
in
difficult
german
for
one
thing
his
mind
heard
the
rushing
past
of
this
man
ideas
they
moved
together
along
the
same
stream
of
thought
and
the
irishman
knew
that
what
he
thus
heard
was
true
at
any
rate
for
himself
and
at
the
same
time
he
recognized
with
admiration
the
skill
with
which
this
scientific
mystic
of
a
sought
to
lead
him
back
into
the
safer
regions
of
his
normal
state
stahl
did
not
now
oppose
or
deny
catching
the
wave
of
the
celt
experience
he
let
his
thought
run
sympathetically
with
it
alongside
as
it
were
guiding
gently
and
insinuatingly
down
to
earth
again
and
the
result
justified
this
cunning
wisdom
returned
to
the
common
world
by
degrees
for
it
was
enchanting
to
find
his
amazing
adventure
explained
even
in
this
partial
speculative
way
who
else
among
his
acquaintances
would
have
listened
at
all
much
less
admitted
its
possibility
but
why
in
particular
he
asked
ca
everybody
know
these
cosmic
reactions
you
speak
of
it
was
his
intellect
that
asked
the
foolish
question
his
whole
self
knew
the
answer
beforehand
because
replied
the
doctor
tapping
his
saucer
to
emphasize
each
word
in
some
way
you
have
retained
an
almost
unbelievable
simplicity
of
heart
an
innocence
singularly
undefiled
a
sort
of
primal
spontaneous
innocence
that
has
kept
you
clean
and
open
i
venture
even
to
suggest
that
shame
as
most
men
know
it
has
never
come
to
you
at
all
the
words
sank
down
into
him
passing
the
intellect
that
would
have
criticized
they
nested
deep
within
where
the
intuition
knew
them
true
behind
the
clumsy
language
that
is
he
caught
the
thought
as
if
i
were
a
saint
he
laughed
faintly
stahl
shook
his
head
rather
because
you
live
detached
he
replied
and
have
never
identified
your
self
with
the
rubbish
of
life
the
channels
in
you
are
still
open
to
these
tides
of
larger
existence
i
wish
i
had
your
courage
while
others
the
german
hesitated
a
moment
most
men
he
said
choosing
his
words
with
evident
care
are
too
grossly
organized
to
be
aware
that
these
reactions
of
a
wider
consciousness
can
be
possible
at
all
their
minute
normal
self
they
mistake
for
the
whole
hence
denying
even
the
experiences
of
others
actual
personality
may
be
something
considerably
unlike
that
conception
of
it
which
is
based
on
our
present
terrestrial
consciousness
a
form
of
consciousness
suited
to
and
developed
by
our
temporary
existence
here
not
necessarily
more
than
a
fraction
of
our
total
it
is
quite
credible
that
our
entire
personality
is
never
terrestrially
manifest
obviously
he
quoted
the
irishman
had
read
the
words
somewhere
he
came
back
more
and
more
into
the
world
correlated
that
is
the
subconscious
with
the
conscious
yet
consciousness
apart
from
the
brain
is
inconceivable
he
interposed
more
to
hear
the
reply
than
to
express
a
conviction
whether
stahl
divined
his
intention
or
not
he
gave
no
sign
can
not
say
with
any
security
that
the
stuff
called
brain
is
the
only
conceivable
machinery
which
mind
and
consciousness
are
able
to
utilize
though
it
is
true
that
we
know
no
other
the
last
phrase
he
repeated
it
is
true
that
we
know
no
other
sank
deeper
into
his
chair
making
no
reply
his
mind
clutched
at
the
words
too
grossly
organized
and
his
thoughts
ran
back
for
a
moment
to
his
daily
life
in
london
he
pictured
his
friends
and
acquaintances
there
the
men
at
his
club
at
dinner
parties
in
the
parks
at
theatres
he
heard
their
talk
shooting
destruction
of
exquisite
life
horses
politics
women
and
the
rest
yet
good
honest
lovable
fellows
all
but
how
did
they
breathe
in
so
small
a
world
at
all
specimens
of
the
greatest
civilization
ever
known
he
recalled
the
heavy
dazed
expression
on
the
faces
of
one
or
two
to
whom
he
had
sometimes
dared
to
speak
of
those
wider
realms
that
were
so
familiar
to
himself
it
is
true
that
we
know
no
other
he
heard
stahl
repeating
slowly
as
he
looked
down
into
his
cup
and
stirred
the
dregs
then
suddenly
the
doctor
rose
and
came
over
to
his
side
his
eyes
twinkled
and
he
rubbed
his
hands
vigorously
together
as
he
spoke
he
laughed
for
instance
i
have
no
longer
now
the
consciousness
of
that
coffee
i
have
just
swallowed
he
exclaimed
yet
if
it
disagreed
with
me
my
consciousness
of
it
would
return
the
abnormal
states
you
mean
are
a
symptom
of
disorder
then
the
irishman
asked
following
the
analogy
at
present
yes
was
the
reply
and
will
remain
so
until
their
correlation
with
the
smaller
conscious
self
is
better
understood
these
belligerent
powers
of
the
larger
consciousness
are
apt
to
overwhelm
as
yet
that
time
perhaps
is
coming
already
a
few
here
and
there
have
guessed
that
the
states
we
call
hysteria
and
insanity
conditions
of
trance
hypnotism
and
the
like
are
not
too
satisfactorily
explained
he
peered
down
at
his
companion
if
i
could
study
your
self
at
close
quarters
for
a
few
years
he
added
significantly
and
under
various
conditions
i
might
teach
the
world
thank
you
cried
the
irishman
now
wholly
returned
into
his
ordinary
self
he
could
think
of
nothing
else
to
say
yet
he
meant
the
words
and
gave
them
vital
meaning
he
moved
across
to
another
chair
lighting
a
cigarette
he
puffed
out
clouds
of
smoke
he
did
not
desire
to
be
caught
again
beneath
this
man
microscope
and
in
his
mind
he
had
a
sudden
picture
of
the
speculative
and
experimenting
doctor
being
requested
to
sever
his
connection
with
the
great
hospital
for
the
sake
of
the
latter
reputation
but
stahl
in
no
way
offended
was
following
his
own
thoughts
aloud
half
speaking
to
himself
for
a
being
organized
as
you
are
more
active
in
the
outlying
tracts
of
consciousness
than
in
the
centers
lying
nearer
home
a
being
like
yourself
i
say
might
become
aware
of
other
life
and
other
personalities
even
more
advanced
and
highly
organized
than
that
of
the
earth
a
strange
excitement
came
upon
him
making
his
eyes
shine
he
walked
to
and
fro
watching
him
a
touch
of
alarm
mingled
with
his
interest
and
to
think
of
the
great
majority
that
denies
because
they
are
dead
he
cried
smothered
undivining
living
in
that
uninspired
fragment
which
they
deem
the
whole
ah
my
friend
and
he
came
abruptly
nearer
the
pathos
the
comedy
the
pert
of
their
dull
pride
the
crass
stupidity
and
littleness
of
their
denials
in
the
eyes
of
those
like
ourselves
who
have
actually
known
the
passion
of
the
larger
experience
for
all
this
modern
talk
about
a
subliminal
self
is
woven
round
a
profoundly
significant
truth
a
truth
newly
discovered
and
only
just
beginning
to
be
understood
we
are
much
greater
than
we
know
and
there
is
a
vast
subconscious
part
of
us
but
what
is
more
important
still
there
is
a
as
well
the
former
represents
what
the
race
has
discarded
it
is
past
but
the
latter
stands
for
what
it
reaches
out
to
in
the
future
the
perfect
man
you
dream
of
perhaps
is
he
who
shall
eventually
combine
the
two
for
there
is
i
think
a
vast
amount
the
race
has
discarded
unwisely
and
prematurely
it
is
of
value
and
will
have
to
be
recovered
in
the
subconsciousness
it
lies
secure
and
waiting
but
it
is
the
that
you
should
aim
for
not
the
other
for
there
lie
those
greater
powers
which
so
mysteriously
wait
upon
the
call
of
genius
inspiration
hypnotism
and
the
rest
one
leads
though
to
the
other
interrupted
quickly
it
is
merely
a
question
of
the
swing
of
the
pendulum
possibly
was
the
laconic
reply
they
join
hands
i
mean
behind
my
back
as
it
were
possibly
this
stranger
then
may
really
lead
me
forward
and
not
back
possibly
again
was
all
the
answer
that
he
got
for
stahl
had
stopped
short
as
though
suddenly
aware
that
he
had
said
too
much
betraying
himself
in
the
sudden
rush
of
interest
and
excitement
the
face
for
a
moment
had
seemed
quite
young
but
now
the
flush
faded
and
the
light
died
out
from
his
eyes
never
understood
how
the
change
came
about
so
quickly
for
in
a
moment
it
seemed
the
doctor
was
calm
again
quietly
lighting
one
of
his
black
cigars
over
by
the
desk
peering
at
him
half
quizzingly
half
mockingly
through
the
smoke
so
i
urge
you
again
he
was
saying
as
though
the
rest
had
been
some
interlude
that
the
irishman
had
half
imagined
to
proceed
with
the
caution
of
this
sane
majority
the
caution
that
makes
for
safety
your
friend
as
i
have
already
suggested
to
you
is
a
direct
expression
of
the
cosmic
life
of
the
earth
perhaps
you
have
guessed
by
now
the
particular
type
and
form
do
not
submit
your
inner
life
too
completely
to
his
guidance
contain
your
self
and
resist
while
it
is
yet
possible
and
while
he
sat
on
there
sipping
hot
coffee
half
listening
to
the
words
that
warned
of
danger
while
at
the
same
time
they
cunningly
urged
him
forwards
it
seemed
that
the
dreams
of
childhood
revived
in
him
with
a
power
that
obliterated
this
present
day
the
childhood
however
not
of
his
mere
body
but
of
his
spirit
when
the
world
herself
was
young
he
too
had
dwelt
in
arcady
known
the
free
life
of
splendor
and
simplicity
in
some
saturnian
reign
for
now
this
dream
but
half
remembered
half
believed
though
eternally
yearned
for
dream
of
a
golden
age
untouched
by
time
still
there
still
accessible
still
inhabited
was
actually
coming
true
it
surely
was
that
old
garden
of
innocence
and
joy
where
the
soul
while
all
unvexed
by
a
sham
and
superficial
civilization
of
the
mind
might
yet
know
growth
a
realm
half
divined
by
saints
and
poets
but
to
the
gross
majority
forgotten
or
denied
the
simple
life
this
new
interpretation
of
it
at
first
overwhelmed
the
eyes
of
his
soul
turned
wild
with
glory
the
passion
that
the
world
in
desolate
places
was
his
his
too
the
strength
of
rushing
rivers
that
coursed
their
parent
being
he
shared
the
terror
of
the
mountains
and
the
singing
of
the
sweet
spring
rains
the
spread
wonder
of
the
woods
of
the
world
lay
imprisoned
and
explained
in
the
daily
hurry
of
his
very
blood
he
understood
because
he
felt
the
power
of
the
ocean
tides
and
flitting
to
and
fro
through
the
tenderer
regions
of
his
extended
self
danced
the
fragrance
of
all
the
wild
flowers
that
ever
blew
that
strange
allegory
of
man
the
microcosm
and
earth
the
macrocosm
became
a
sudden
blazing
reality
the
feverish
distress
unrest
and
vanity
of
modern
life
was
due
to
the
distance
men
had
traveled
from
the
soul
of
the
world
away
from
large
simplicity
into
the
pettier
state
they
deemed
so
proudly
progress
out
of
the
transliminal
depths
of
this
newly
awakened
consciousness
rose
the
pelt
and
thunder
of
these
magical
and
enormous
cosmic
sensations
the
pulse
and
throb
of
the
planetary
life
where
his
little
self
had
fringed
her
own
those
untamed
profundities
in
himself
that
walked
alone
companionless
among
modern
men
suffering
an
eternal
nostalgia
at
last
knew
the
approach
to
satisfaction
for
when
the
inner
catastrophe
completed
itself
and
escape
should
come
that
transfer
of
the
conscious
center
across
the
threshold
into
this
vaster
region
stimulated
by
the
earth
all
his
longings
would
be
housed
at
last
like
homing
birds
nested
in
the
gentle
places
his
yearnings
all
these
years
had
lovingly
built
for
them
in
a
living
nature
the
fever
of
modern
life
the
torture
and
unrest
of
a
false
external
civilization
that
trained
the
brain
while
it
still
left
wars
and
baseness
in
the
heart
would
drop
from
him
like
the
symptoms
of
some
fierce
disease
the
god
of
speed
and
mechanism
that
ruled
the
world
today
urging
men
at
ninety
miles
an
hour
to
enter
a
heaven
where
material
gain
was
only
a
little
sublimated
and
not
utterly
denied
would
pass
for
the
nightmare
that
it
really
was
in
its
place
the
cosmic
life
of
undifferentiated
simplicity
clean
and
sweet
and
big
would
hold
his
soul
in
the
truly
everlasting
arms
and
that
little
german
doctor
sitting
yonder
enlightened
yet
afraid
seeking
an
impossible
compromise
stahl
could
no
more
stop
his
going
than
a
fly
could
stop
the
rising
of
the
atlantic
tides
out
of
all
this
tumult
of
confused
thought
and
feeling
there
rose
then
the
silver
face
of
some
forgotten
and
passionate
loveliness
apparently
it
reached
his
lips
for
he
heard
his
own
voice
murmuring
outside
him
somewhere
across
the
cabin
the
gods
of
greece
and
of
the
world
yet
the
instant
words
clothed
it
the
flashing
glory
went
the
idea
plunged
back
out
of
sight
untranslatable
in
language
thrilled
and
sad
he
lay
back
in
his
chair
watching
the
doctor
and
trying
to
focus
his
mind
upon
what
he
was
saying
but
the
lost
idea
still
dived
and
reared
within
him
like
a
shining
form
yet
never
showing
more
than
this
radiant
point
above
the
surface
the
passion
and
beauty
of
it
he
tried
no
more
to
tie
a
label
of
modern
words
about
its
neck
he
let
it
swim
and
dive
and
leap
within
him
uncaught
only
he
understood
better
why
close
to
greece
his
friends
had
betrayed
their
inner
selves
and
why
for
the
lesser
of
the
two
whose
bodily
cage
was
not
yet
fully
clamped
and
barred
by
physical
maturity
escape
or
return
rather
had
been
possible
nay
had
been
inevitable
xxiv
stahl
he
remembers
had
been
talking
for
a
long
time
the
general
sense
of
what
he
said
reached
him
perhaps
but
certainly
not
many
of
the
words
the
doctor
it
was
clear
wished
to
coax
from
him
the
most
intimate
description
possible
of
his
experience
he
put
things
crudely
in
order
to
challenge
criticism
and
thus
to
make
his
companion
reason
sit
in
judgment
on
his
heart
if
this
visionary
celt
would
let
his
intellect
pass
soberly
and
dissectingly
upon
these
flaming
states
of
wider
consciousness
he
had
touched
the
doctor
would
have
data
of
real
value
for
his
own
purposes
but
this
discriminating
analysis
was
precisely
what
the
irishman
found
impossible
his
soul
was
too
dispersed
to
concentrate
upon
modern
terms
and
phrases
these
in
any
case
dealt
only
with
the
fragments
of
self
that
manifested
through
brain
and
body
the
rest
could
be
felt
only
never
truly
described
since
the
beginning
of
the
world
such
transcendental
experiences
had
never
been
translatable
in
the
language
of
common
sense
and
today
even
when
a
few
daring
minds
sought
a
laborious
classification
straining
the
resources
of
psychology
the
results
were
little
better
than
a
rather
enticing
and
suggestive
confusion
in
his
written
account
indeed
he
gives
no
proper
report
of
what
stahl
tried
to
say
a
gaping
hiatus
appears
in
the
manuscript
with
only
asterisks
and
numbers
that
referred
to
pages
of
his
tumbled
notebooks
following
these
indications
i
came
across
the
skeletons
of
ideas
which
perhaps
were
the
raw
material
so
to
say
of
these
crude
and
speculative
statements
that
the
german
poured
out
at
him
across
that
cabin
blocks
of
exaggeration
he
flung
at
him
in
the
hope
of
winning
some
critical
and
intelligible
response
like
the
structure
of
some
giant
they
read
some
toppling
scaffolding
that
needed
reduction
in
scale
before
it
could
be
focused
for
normal
human
sight
nature
was
really
alive
for
those
who
believed
and
worshipped
for
worship
was
that
state
of
consciousness
which
opens
the
sense
and
provides
the
channel
for
this
singular
interior
realization
in
very
desolate
and
lonely
places
unsmothered
and
unstained
by
men
as
they
exist
today
such
expressions
of
the
earth
stupendous
central
vitality
were
still
possible
the
russian
himself
was
some
such
fragment
some
such
cosmic
being
strayed
down
among
men
in
a
form
outwardly
human
and
the
irishman
had
in
his
own
wild
untamed
heart
those
same
very
tender
and
primitive
possibilities
which
enabled
him
to
know
and
feel
it
in
the
body
however
he
was
fenced
off
without
only
by
the
disentanglement
of
his
primitive
self
from
the
modern
development
which
caged
it
could
he
recover
this
strange
lost
eden
and
taste
in
its
fullness
the
of
the
planetary
consciousness
which
called
him
back
this
dissociation
might
be
experienced
temporarily
as
a
subliminal
adventure
or
permanently
in
death
here
it
seemed
was
a
version
of
the
profound
mystical
idea
that
a
man
must
lose
his
life
to
find
it
and
that
the
personal
self
must
be
merged
in
a
larger
one
to
know
peace
the
incessant
burning
nostalgia
that
dwells
in
the
heart
of
every
religion
known
to
men
escape
from
the
endless
pain
of
futile
personal
ambitions
and
desires
for
external
things
that
are
unquenchable
because
never
possible
of
satisfaction
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
before
in
so
literal
and
simple
a
form
it
explained
his
sense
of
kinship
with
the
earth
and
nature
rather
than
with
men
there
followed
then
another
note
which
the
irishman
had
also
omitted
from
his
complete
story
as
i
found
it
in
this
that
lay
among
the
dust
and
dinginess
of
the
paddington
like
some
flaming
gem
in
a
refuse
heap
it
was
brief
but
pregnant
the
block
of
another
idea
fechner
apparently
hurled
at
him
by
the
little
doctor
that
just
as
the
body
takes
up
the
fact
of
the
bruised
lung
into
its
own
general
consciousness
lifting
it
thereby
from
the
submerged
unrealized
state
and
just
as
our
human
consciousness
can
be
caught
up
again
as
a
part
of
the
earth
so
in
turn
the
planet
own
vast
personality
is
included
in
the
collective
consciousness
of
the
entire
universe
all
steps
and
stages
of
advance
to
that
final
and
august
consciousnss
of
which
they
are
fragments
projections
manifestations
in
time
god
and
the
immense
conception
at
any
rate
gave
him
a
curious
flashing
clue
to
that
passionate
inclusion
which
a
higher
form
of
consciousness
may
feel
for
the
countless
lesser
manifestations
below
it
and
so
to
that
love
for
humanity
as
a
whole
that
saviors
feel
yet
out
of
all
this
deep
flood
of
ideas
and
suggestions
that
somehow
poured
about
him
from
the
mind
of
this
german
alternately
scientist
and
mystic
emerged
with
his
own
smaller
and
vivid
personal
delight
that
he
would
presently
himself
escape
escape
under
the
guidance
of
the
big
russian
into
some
remote
corner
of
his
own
extended
being
where
he
would
enjoy
a
with
the
and
know
subjectively
at
least
the
fruition
of
all
his
yearnings
the
doctor
had
phrased
it
once
that
a
part
of
him
fluid
etheric
or
astral
malleable
by
desire
would
escape
and
attain
to
this
result
but
after
all
the
separation
of
one
portion
of
himself
from
the
main
personality
could
only
mean
being
conscious
it
another
part
of
it
in
a
division
usually
submerged
as
stahl
so
crudely
put
it
the
earth
had
bruised
him
he
would
know
in
some
little
measure
the
tides
of
her
own
huge
life
his
longings
loneliness
and
nostalgia
explained
and
satisfied
he
would
find
that
fair
old
garden
he
might
even
know
the
lesser
gods
that
afternoon
at
smyrna
the
matter
was
officially
reported
and
so
officially
done
with
it
caused
little
enough
comment
on
the
steamer
the
majority
of
the
passengers
had
hardly
noticed
the
boy
at
all
much
less
his
disappearance
and
while
many
of
them
landed
there
for
ephesus
still
more
left
the
ship
next
day
at
constantinople
the
big
russian
though
he
kept
mostly
to
his
own
cabin
was
closely
watched
by
the
ship
officers
and
too
realized
that
he
was
under
observation
but
nothing
happened
the
emptied
steamer
pursued
her
quiet
way
and
the
earth
unrealized
by
her
teeming
freight
so
busy
with
their
tiny
personal
aims
rushed
forwards
upon
her
glorious
journey
through
space
alone
realized
her
presence
aware
that
he
rushed
with
her
amid
a
living
universe
but
he
kept
his
new
sensations
to
himself
the
remainder
of
the
voyage
indeed
across
the
black
sea
samsoun
and
trebizond
is
hazy
in
his
mind
so
far
as
practical
details
are
concerned
for
he
found
himself
in
a
dreamy
state
of
deep
peace
and
would
sometimes
sit
for
hours
in
reverie
only
reminded
of
the
present
by
certain
pricks
of
annoyance
from
the
outer
world
he
had
returned
of
course
to
his
own
stateroom
yet
felt
in
such
close
sympathy
with
his
companion
that
no
outward
expression
by
way
of
confidence
or
explanation
was
necessary
in
their
subconsciousness
they
were
together
and
at
one
the
pricks
of
annoyance
came
as
may
be
expected
chiefly
from
stahl
and
took
the
form
of
variations
of
i
told
you
so
the
man
was
in
a
state
of
almost
anger
caused
half
by
disappointment
half
by
unsatisfied
curiosity
his
cargo
of
oil
and
water
would
not
mix
yet
he
knew
not
which
to
throw
overboard
here
was
another
instance
where
facts
refused
to
tally
with
the
beliefs
dictated
by
sane
reason
where
the
dazzling
speculations
he
played
with
threatened
to
win
the
day
and
destroy
the
compromise
his
soul
loved
the
irishman
however
did
not
resent
his
curiosity
though
he
made
no
attempt
to
satisfy
it
he
allowed
him
to
become
authoritative
and
professional
to
treat
him
somewhat
as
a
patient
what
could
it
matter
to
him
who
in
a
few
hours
would
land
at
batoum
and
go
off
with
his
guide
and
comrade
to
some
place
where
the
thought
he
could
never
see
completed
in
words
for
he
only
knew
that
the
fulfillment
of
the
adventure
would
take
place
somewhere
somehow
somewhen
in
that
space
within
the
soul
of
which
external
space
is
but
an
image
and
a
figure
what
takes
place
in
the
mind
and
heart
are
alone
the
true
events
their
outward
expression
in
the
shifting
and
impermanent
shapes
of
matter
is
the
least
real
thing
in
all
the
world
for
him
the
experience
would
be
true
real
authoritative
fact
in
the
deepest
sense
of
the
word
already
he
saw
it
whole
faith
asks
no
travelers
questions
exact
height
of
mountains
length
of
rivers
distance
from
the
sea
precise
spelling
of
names
and
so
forth
he
felt
the
quaint
and
striking
simile
is
in
the
written
account
like
a
man
hunting
for
a
in
a
strange
city
absurdly
difficult
to
find
as
though
purposely
concealed
by
the
authorities
amid
details
of
street
and
houses
to
which
the
eye
is
unaccustomed
yet
really
close
at
hand
all
the
time
but
at
trebizond
a
few
hours
before
batoum
stahl
in
his
zealous
attentions
went
too
far
for
that
evening
he
gave
his
patient
a
in
his
coffee
that
caused
him
to
lie
for
twelve
hours
on
the
cabin
sofa
and
when
at
length
he
woke
toward
noon
the
customs
officers
had
been
aboard
since
nine
and
most
of
the
passengers
had
already
landed
among
them
leaving
no
message
the
big
russian
had
also
gone
ashore
and
though
stahl
may
have
been
actuated
by
the
wisest
and
kindest
motives
he
was
not
quite
prepared
for
the
novel
experience
with
which
it
provided
him
namely
of
hearing
an
angry
irishman
saying
rapidly
what
he
thought
of
him
in
a
stream
of
eloquent
language
that
lasted
nearly
a
quarter
of
an
hour
without
a
break
xxv
although
batoum
is
a
small
place
and
the
trains
that
leave
it
during
the
day
are
few
enough
knew
that
to
search
for
his
friend
by
the
methods
of
the
ordinary
detective
was
useless
it
would
have
been
also
wrong
the
man
had
gone
deliberately
without
attempting
to
say
because
having
come
together
in
the
real
and
inner
sense
real
separation
was
not
possible
the
vital
portion
of
their
beings
thought
feeling
and
desire
were
close
and
always
would
be
their
bodies
busy
at
different
points
of
the
map
among
the
casual
realities
of
external
life
could
make
no
change
in
that
and
at
the
right
moment
they
would
assuredly
meet
again
to
begin
the
promised
journey
thus
at
least
in
some
fashion
peculiarly
his
own
was
the
way
the
irishman
felt
and
this
was
why
after
the
first
anger
with
his
german
friend
he
resigned
himself
patiently
to
the
practical
business
he
had
in
hand
the
little
incident
was
characteristically
revealing
and
shows
how
firmly
rooted
in
his
imaginative
temperament
was
the
belief
the
unalterable
conviction
rather
that
his
life
operated
upon
an
outer
and
an
inner
plane
simultaneously
the
one
ever
reacting
upon
the
other
it
was
as
if
he
were
aware
of
two
separate
sets
of
faculties
subtly
linked
one
carrying
on
the
affairs
of
the
physical
man
in
the
practical
world
the
other
dealing
with
the
spiritual
economy
in
the
subconscious
to
attend
to
the
latter
alone
was
to
be
a
useless
dreamer
among
men
unpractical
unbalanced
to
neglect
it
wholly
for
the
former
was
to
be
crassly
limited
but
half
alive
to
combine
the
two
in
effective
was
to
achieve
that
high
level
of
a
successful
personality
which
some
perhaps
term
genius
some
prophet
and
others
saint
it
meant
at
any
rate
to
have
sources
of
inspiration
within
oneself
thus
he
spent
the
day
completing
what
was
necessary
for
his
simple
outfit
and
put
up
for
the
night
at
one
of
the
little
hotels
that
spread
their
tables
invitingly
upon
the
pavement
so
that
dinner
may
be
enjoyed
in
full
view
of
one
of
the
most
picturesque
streams
of
traffic
it
is
possible
to
see
the
sultry
enervating
heat
of
the
day
had
passed
and
a
cool
breeze
came
shorewards
over
the
black
sea
with
a
box
of
thin
russian
cigarettes
before
him
he
lingered
over
the
golden
kakhetian
wine
and
watched
the
crowded
street
knowing
enough
of
the
language
to
bargain
smartly
for
his
room
his
pillows
sheets
and
samovar
he
yet
could
scarcely
compass
conversation
with
the
strangers
about
him
of
russian
proper
besides
he
heard
little
there
was
a
babel
of
many
tongues
armenian
turkish
georgian
explosive
phrases
of
swanetian
soft
gliding
persian
words
and
the
sharp
or
guttural
exclamations
of
the
giant
fellows
all
heavily
armed
who
belonged
to
the
bewildering
tribes
that
dwelt
among
the
mountains
beyond
occasionally
came
a
broken
bit
of
french
or
german
but
they
strayed
in
lost
and
bizarre
as
fragments
from
some
distant
or
forgotten
world
down
the
pavement
jostling
his
elbows
strode
the
constant
gorgeous
procession
of
curious
wild
barbaric
faces
bearded
with
hooked
noses
flashing
eyes
burkas
flowing
of
silver
and
ivory
gleaming
across
chests
in
the
glare
of
the
electric
light
bashliks
of
white
black
and
yellow
wool
upon
the
head
increasing
the
stature
black
sea
knives
stuck
in
most
belts
rifles
swung
across
great
supple
shoulders
long
swords
trailing
turkish
gypsies
dark
and
walking
softly
in
leather
slippers
of
endless
and
fascinating
variety
many
colored
and
splendid
it
all
was
from
time
to
time
a
droschky
with
two
horses
or
a
private
carriage
with
three
rattled
noisily
over
the
cobbles
at
a
reckless
pace
stopping
with
the
abruptness
of
a
practiced
skater
and
officers
with
narrow
belted
waists
like
those
of
women
their
cloaks
reaching
down
high
boots
of
shining
leather
sprang
out
to
pay
the
driver
and
take
a
vacant
table
at
his
side
and
once
or
twice
a
body
of
soldiers
several
hundred
strong
singing
the
national
songs
with
a
vigor
hoarse
wild
somehow
half
terrible
passed
at
a
swinging
gait
away
into
the
darkness
at
the
end
of
the
street
the
roar
of
their
barbaric
singing
dying
away
in
the
distance
by
the
sea
where
the
boom
of
waves
just
caught
it
and
loved
it
all
and
thrilled
as
he
watched
and
listened
from
his
hidden
self
within
something
passed
out
and
joined
it
he
felt
the
wild
pulse
of
energetic
life
that
drove
along
with
the
tumult
of
it
the
savage
untamed
soul
in
him
leaped
as
he
saw
the
blood
ran
faster
sitting
thus
upon
the
bank
of
the
hurrying
stream
he
knew
himself
akin
to
the
main
body
of
the
invisible
current
further
out
it
drew
him
with
it
and
he
experienced
a
quickening
of
all
his
impulses
toward
some
wild
freedom
that
was
mighty
clean
simple
civilian
dress
was
rare
and
noticeable
when
it
came
the
shipping
agents
wore
black
alpaca
coats
white
trousers
and
modern
hats
of
straw
a
few
ship
officers
in
blue
with
official
caps
passed
in
and
out
like
men
without
a
wedding
garment
as
distressingly
out
of
the
picture
as
tourists
in
check
knickerbockers
and
nailed
boots
moving
through
some
dim
cathedral
aisle
recognized
one
or
two
from
his
own
steamer
and
turned
his
head
the
other
way
it
hurt
he
caught
himself
thinking
as
he
saw
them
of
stock
exchanges
belgravia
dinner
parties
private
views
small
and
earlies
musical
comedy
and
all
the
rest
of
the
dismal
and
meager
program
these
harmless
little
modern
uniforms
were
worse
than
ludicrous
for
they
formed
links
with
the
glare
and
noise
of
the
civilization
he
had
left
behind
the
smeared
vulgarity
of
the
big
cities
where
men
and
women
live
in
their
possessions
wasting
life
in
that
worship
of
external
detail
they
call
progress
a
german
voice
crashed
through
his
dream
already
at
the
wine
these
caucasian
vintages
are
good
they
really
taste
of
grapes
and
earth
and
flowers
yes
thanks
i
join
you
for
a
moment
if
i
may
we
only
lie
three
days
in
port
and
are
glad
to
get
ashore
called
for
a
second
glass
and
passed
the
cigarettes
i
prefer
my
black
cigars
thank
you
was
the
reply
lighting
one
you
push
on
tomorrow
i
suppose
kars
tiflis
erzerum
or
somewhere
a
little
wilder
in
the
mountains
eh
toward
the
mountains
yes
the
irishman
said
stahl
was
the
only
person
he
could
possibly
have
allowed
to
sit
next
him
at
such
a
time
he
had
quite
forgiven
him
now
and
though
at
first
he
felt
no
positive
welcome
the
strange
link
between
the
two
men
quickly
asserted
itself
and
welded
them
together
in
that
odd
harmony
they
knew
in
spite
of
all
differences
they
could
be
silent
together
too
without
distress
or
awkwardness
sure
test
that
at
least
some
portion
of
their
personalities
fused
and
for
a
long
time
they
remained
silent
watching
the
surge
and
movement
of
the
old
old
types
about
them
they
sipped
the
yellow
wine
and
smoked
the
stars
came
out
the
carriages
grew
less
from
far
away
floated
a
deep
sonorous
echo
now
and
then
of
the
soldiers
singing
by
their
barracks
sometimes
a
steamer
hooted
cossacks
swung
by
often
some
wild
cry
rang
out
from
a
side
street
there
were
heavy
unfamiliar
perfumes
in
the
air
presently
stahl
began
talking
about
the
revolution
of
a
few
years
before
and
the
scenes
of
violence
he
had
witnessed
in
these
little
streets
the
shooting
barricades
bombs
thrown
into
passing
carriages
cossacks
charging
down
the
pavements
with
swords
drawn
shouting
and
howling
listened
with
a
part
of
his
mind
at
any
rate
the
rest
of
him
was
much
further
away
he
was
up
among
the
mountain
fastnesses
already
it
seemed
he
knew
the
secret
places
of
the
mist
the
lair
of
every
running
wind
two
tall
mountain
tribesmen
swaggered
past
close
to
their
table
the
thick
grey
burkas
almost
swept
their
glasses
they
walked
magnificently
with
easy
flowing
stride
straight
from
the
hips
the
earth
here
said
taking
advantage
of
a
pause
in
the
other
chatter
produces
some
splendid
types
look
at
those
two
they
make
one
think
of
trees
walking
blown
along
bodily
before
a
wind
he
watched
them
with
admiration
as
they
swung
off
and
disappeared
among
the
crowd
stahl
glancing
keenly
at
him
laughed
a
little
yes
he
said
brave
generous
fellows
too
as
a
rule
who
will
shoot
you
for
a
pistol
that
excites
their
envy
yet
give
their
life
to
save
one
of
their
savage
dogs
they
still
natural
he
added
after
a
moment
hesitation
still
unspoiled
they
live
close
to
nature
with
a
vengeance
up
among
the
ossetians
on
the
high
saddles
you
find
true
pagans
who
worship
trees
sacrifice
blood
and
offer
bread
and
salt
to
the
still
asked
sipping
his
wine
still
replied
stahl
following
his
example
over
the
glasses
rims
their
eyes
met
both
smiled
though
neither
quite
knew
why
the
irishman
perhaps
was
thinking
of
the
little
city
clerks
he
knew
at
home
one
of
these
big
men
so
full
of
rushing
vigorous
life
would
eat
a
dozen
at
a
sitting
there
something
here
the
rest
of
the
world
has
lost
he
murmured
to
himself
but
the
doctor
heard
him
you
feel
it
he
asked
quickly
his
eyes
brightening
the
awful
primitive
beauty
i
feel
something
certainly
was
the
cautious
answer
he
could
not
possibly
have
said
more
just
then
yet
it
seemed
as
though
he
heard
far
echoes
of
that
voice
that
had
been
first
borne
to
his
ears
across
the
blue
ægean
in
the
gorges
of
these
terrible
mountains
it
surely
sounded
still
these
men
must
know
it
too
the
spell
of
this
strange
land
will
never
leave
you
once
you
felt
it
pursued
the
other
quietly
his
voice
deepening
even
in
the
towns
here
tiflis
kutais
i
have
felt
it
hereabouts
is
the
cradle
of
the
human
race
they
say
and
the
people
have
not
changed
for
thousands
of
years
some
of
them
you
find
he
hunted
for
a
word
then
said
with
a
curious
shrugging
gesture
terrific
ah
said
the
irishman
lighting
a
fresh
cigarette
from
the
dying
stump
so
clumsily
that
the
trembling
of
the
hand
was
noticeable
and
akin
most
likely
said
stahl
thrusting
his
face
across
the
table
with
a
whispering
tone
to
that
man
who
tempted
you
did
not
answer
he
drank
the
liquid
golden
sunshine
in
his
glass
his
eyes
lifted
to
the
stars
that
watched
above
the
sea
between
the
surge
of
human
figures
came
a
little
wind
from
the
grim
mysterious
caucasus
beyond
he
turned
all
tender
as
a
child
receiving
as
with
a
shock
of
sudden
strength
and
sweetness
a
thousand
intimate
messages
from
the
splendid
mood
of
old
who
here
expressed
herself
in
such
a
potent
breed
of
men
and
mountains
he
heard
the
doctor
voice
still
speaking
as
from
a
distance
though
for
here
they
all
grow
with
her
they
do
not
fight
her
and
resist
she
pours
freely
through
them
there
is
no
opposition
the
channels
still
lie
open
and
they
share
her
life
and
power
that
beauty
which
the
modern
world
has
lost
repeated
the
other
to
himself
lingering
over
the
words
and
wondering
why
they
expressed
so
little
of
what
he
really
meant
but
which
will
never
never
come
again
stahl
completed
the
sentence
there
was
a
wistful
genuine
sadness
in
his
voice
and
eyes
and
the
sympathy
touched
the
inflammable
celt
with
fire
it
was
ever
thus
with
him
the
little
man
opposite
with
the
ragged
beard
and
the
bald
domed
head
gleaming
in
the
electric
light
had
laid
a
card
upon
the
table
showing
a
bit
of
his
burning
heart
the
generous
irishman
responded
like
a
child
laying
himself
bare
so
hungry
was
he
for
comprehension
men
have
everywhere
else
clothed
her
fair
body
with
their
smothering
ugly
clothing
and
their
herded
cities
he
burst
out
so
loud
that
the
armenian
waiter
sidled
up
thinking
he
called
for
wine
but
here
she
lies
naked
and
unashamed
sweet
in
divinity
made
simple
by
jove
i
tell
you
doctor
it
burns
and
sweeps
me
with
a
kind
of
splendid
passion
that
drowns
my
little
personality
of
the
twentieth
century
i
could
run
out
and
worship
fall
down
and
kiss
the
grass
and
soil
and
sea
he
drew
back
suddenly
like
a
wounded
animal
his
face
turned
scarlet
as
though
he
knew
himself
convicted
of
an
hysterical
outburst
eyes
had
changed
even
as
he
spoke
the
flaming
words
that
struggled
so
awkwardly
to
seize
his
mood
of
rapture
a
thought
the
earth
poured
through
him
for
a
moment
the
bitter
smile
lay
in
them
and
on
the
lips
the
cold
and
critical
expression
of
the
other
stahl
skeptic
and
a
revulsion
of
feeling
caught
them
both
but
to
came
the
thought
that
once
again
he
had
been
drawn
was
being
coaxed
for
examination
beneath
the
microscope
the
material
here
stahl
said
presently
with
the
calm
tones
of
a
dispassionate
diagnosis
is
magnificent
as
you
say
uncivilized
without
being
merely
savage
untamed
yet
far
from
crude
barbarism
when
the
progress
of
the
age
gets
into
this
land
the
transformation
will
be
grand
when
russia
lets
in
culture
when
modern
improvements
have
developed
her
resources
and
trained
the
wild
human
forces
into
useful
channels
he
went
on
calmly
by
the
yard
till
it
was
all
the
irishman
could
do
not
to
dash
the
in
his
face
remember
my
words
when
you
are
up
in
the
lonely
mountains
he
concluded
at
length
smiling
his
queer
sardonic
smile
and
keep
yourself
in
hand
put
on
the
brakes
when
possible
your
experience
will
thus
have
far
more
value
and
you
replied
bluntly
so
bluntly
it
was
almost
rudeness
go
back
to
fechner
and
try
to
save
your
compromising
soul
before
it
is
too
late
still
following
those
lights
that
do
mislead
the
morn
stahl
added
gently
breaking
into
english
for
a
phrase
he
apparently
loved
they
laughed
and
raised
their
glasses
a
long
pause
came
which
neither
cared
to
break
the
streets
were
growing
empty
the
personality
of
the
mysterious
little
black
sea
port
folding
away
into
the
darkness
the
wilder
element
had
withdrawn
behind
the
shuttered
windows
there
came
a
murmur
of
the
waves
but
the
soldiers
no
longer
sang
the
droschkys
ceased
to
rattle
past
the
night
flowed
down
more
thickly
from
the
mountains
and
the
air
moist
with
that
malarial
miasma
which
makes
the
climate
of
this
reclaimed
marsh
whereon
batoum
is
built
so
unhealthy
closed
unpleasantly
about
them
the
stars
died
in
it
another
glass
suggested
stahl
a
drink
to
the
gods
of
the
future
and
till
we
meet
again
on
your
return
journey
eh
i
walk
with
you
to
the
steamer
was
the
reply
i
never
care
for
much
wine
and
the
gods
of
the
future
will
prefer
my
usual
offering
i
think
imaginative
faith
the
doctor
did
not
ask
him
to
explain
they
walked
down
the
middle
of
the
narrow
streets
no
one
was
about
nor
were
there
lights
in
many
windows
once
or
twice
from
an
upper
story
came
the
faint
twanging
of
a
balalaika
against
the
drone
of
voices
and
occasionally
they
passed
a
little
garden
where
figures
outlined
themselves
among
the
trees
with
the
clink
of
glasses
laughter
of
men
and
girls
and
the
glowing
tips
of
cigarettes
they
turned
down
toward
the
harbor
where
the
spars
and
funnels
of
the
big
steamers
were
just
visible
against
the
sky
and
opposite
the
unshuttered
window
of
a
shop
one
of
those
modern
shops
that
oddly
mar
the
town
with
assorted
german
tinware
paris
hats
and
oleographs
indiscriminately
mingled
stahl
stopped
a
moment
and
pointed
they
moved
up
idly
and
looked
in
from
the
shadows
of
the
other
side
well
hidden
an
armed
patrol
eyed
them
suspiciously
though
they
were
not
aware
of
it
it
was
before
a
window
like
this
remarked
stahl
apparently
casually
that
i
once
in
tiflis
overheard
two
mountain
georgians
talking
together
as
they
examined
a
reproduction
of
a
modern
picture
they
spoke
in
half
whispers
but
i
caught
the
trend
of
what
they
said
you
know
the
picture
perhaps
i
seen
it
somewhere
yes
was
the
short
reply
but
what
were
they
saying
he
strove
to
keep
his
voice
commonplace
and
casual
like
his
companion
oh
just
discussing
it
together
but
with
a
curious
stretched
interest
stahl
went
on
one
asked
does
it
say
and
pointed
to
the
inscription
underneath
they
could
not
read
for
a
long
time
they
stared
in
silence
their
faces
grave
and
half
afraid
is
it
repeated
the
first
one
and
the
other
a
much
older
man
heavily
bearded
and
of
giant
build
replied
low
what
i
told
you
about
there
was
awe
in
his
tone
and
manner
still
live
in
the
big
valley
of
the
rhododendrons
beyond
mentioning
some
lonely
uninhabited
region
toward
daghestan
come
in
the
spring
and
are
very
swift
and
roaring
must
always
hide
to
see
them
is
to
die
but
they
can
not
die
they
are
of
the
mountains
they
are
older
older
than
the
stones
and
the
dogs
will
warn
you
or
the
horses
or
sometimes
a
great
sudden
wind
though
you
must
never
shoot
they
stood
gazing
in
solemn
wonder
for
minutes
till
at
last
realizing
that
their
silence
was
final
i
moved
away
there
were
manifestations
of
life
in
the
mountains
you
see
that
they
had
seen
and
knew
about
old
forms
akin
to
that
picture
apparently
the
patrol
came
out
of
his
shadows
and
stahl
quickly
drew
his
companion
along
the
pavement
you
have
your
passport
with
you
he
asked
noticing
the
man
behind
them
it
went
to
the
police
this
afternoon
i
have
got
it
back
yet
spoke
thickly
in
a
voice
he
hardly
recognized
as
his
own
how
much
he
welcomed
that
casual
interruption
of
the
practical
world
he
could
never
explain
or
tell
for
the
moment
he
had
felt
like
wax
in
the
other
hands
he
had
dreaded
searching
questions
and
felt
unspeakably
relieved
a
minute
more
and
he
would
have
burst
into
confession
you
should
never
be
without
it
the
doctor
added
the
police
here
are
perfect
fiends
and
can
cause
you
endless
inconvenience
knew
it
all
but
gladly
seized
the
talk
and
spun
it
out
asking
innocent
questions
while
scarcely
listening
to
the
answers
they
distanced
the
patrol
and
neared
the
quays
and
shipping
in
the
darkness
of
the
sky
a
great
line
showed
where
the
spurs
of
the
lesser
caucasus
gloomed
huge
and
solemn
to
the
east
and
west
at
the
gangway
of
the
steamer
they
said
stahl
held
the
irishman
hand
a
moment
in
his
own
remember
when
you
know
temptation
strong
he
said
gravely
though
a
smile
was
in
the
eyes
the
passwords
that
i
now
give
you
humanity
and
civilization
i
try
they
shook
hands
warmly
enough
come
home
by
this
steamer
if
you
can
he
called
down
from
the
deck
and
keep
to
the
middle
of
the
road
on
your
way
back
to
the
hotel
safer
in
a
town
like
this
divined
the
twinkle
in
his
eyes
as
he
said
it
forgive
my
many
sins
he
heard
finally
and
when
we
meet
again
tell
me
your
own
the
darkness
took
the
sentence
but
the
word
the
irishman
took
home
with
him
to
the
little
hotel
was
the
single
one
civilization
and
this
owing
to
the
peculiar
significance
of
intonation
and
accent
with
which
this
bewildering
and
being
had
uttered
it
xxvi
he
walked
along
the
middle
of
the
street
as
stahl
had
advised
he
would
have
done
so
in
any
case
unconsciously
for
he
knew
these
towns
quite
as
well
as
the
german
did
yet
he
did
not
walk
alone
the
entire
earth
walked
with
him
and
personal
danger
was
an
impossibility
a
dozen
ruffians
might
attack
him
but
none
could
take
his
life
how
simple
it
all
seemed
yet
how
utterly
beyond
the
reach
of
intelligible
description
to
those
who
have
never
felt
it
this
sudden
surge
upwards
downwards
all
around
and
about
of
the
vaster
consciousness
amid
which
the
sense
of
normal
individuality
seemed
but
a
tiny
focused
point
that
loss
of
personality
he
first
dreaded
as
an
inner
catastrophe
appeared
to
him
now
for
what
it
actually
was
merely
an
extinction
of
some
phantasmal
illusion
of
self
into
the
only
true
life
here
upon
the
fringe
of
this
of
the
caucasus
the
spirit
of
the
earth
still
manifested
as
of
old
reached
out
lovingly
to
those
of
her
children
who
were
simple
enough
to
respond
ready
to
fold
them
in
and
heal
them
of
the
modern
racking
fevers
which
must
otherwise
destroy
them
the
entire
sky
of
soft
darkness
became
a
hand
that
covered
him
and
stroked
him
into
peace
the
perfume
that
wafted
down
that
narrow
street
beside
him
was
the
single
enveloping
fragrance
of
the
whole
wide
earth
herself
he
caught
the
very
murmur
of
her
splendid
journey
through
the
stars
the
certitude
of
some
state
of
boundless
being
flamed
roaring
and
immense
about
his
soul
and
when
he
reached
his
room
a
little
cell
that
shut
out
light
and
air
he
met
that
sinister
denial
of
the
simple
life
which
for
him
at
least
was
the
true
dweller
on
the
threshold
crashing
in
to
it
he
choked
as
it
were
and
could
have
cried
aloud
it
gripped
and
caught
him
by
the
throat
the
word
that
stahl
stahl
who
understood
even
while
he
warned
and
mocked
and
hesitated
himself
had
flung
so
tauntingly
upon
him
from
the
decks
civilization
upon
his
table
lay
by
chance
the
armenian
had
evidently
unearthed
it
for
his
benefit
a
copy
of
a
london
halfpenny
paper
a
paper
that
feeds
the
public
with
the
ugliest
details
of
all
the
least
important
facts
of
life
by
the
yard
inventing
others
when
the
supply
is
poor
he
read
it
over
vaguely
with
a
sense
of
cold
distress
that
was
half
pain
half
nausea
somehow
it
stirred
his
sense
of
humor
he
returned
slowly
to
his
normal
littler
state
but
it
was
not
the
contrast
which
made
him
smile
rather
was
it
the
chance
juxtaposition
of
certain
of
the
contents
for
on
the
page
facing
the
accounts
of
railway
accidents
of
people
burned
alive
explosions
giant
strikes
crumpled
and
other
countless
horrors
which
modern
inventions
offered
upon
the
altar
of
feverish
progress
he
read
a
complacently
boastful
leader
that
extolled
the
conquest
of
nature
men
had
learned
the
ability
to
pass
from
one
point
to
another
across
the
skin
of
the
globe
in
the
least
possible
time
was
sign
of
the
development
of
the
human
soul
the
pompous
flatulence
of
the
language
touched
bathos
he
thought
of
the
thousands
who
had
read
both
columns
and
preened
themselves
upon
that
leader
he
thought
how
they
would
pride
themselves
upon
the
latest
contrivance
for
speeding
their
inert
bodies
from
one
point
to
another
annihilating
distance
upon
being
able
to
get
from
suburbia
to
the
huge
shops
that
created
artificial
wants
then
filled
them
from
the
pokey
villas
with
their
wee
sham
gardens
to
the
dingy
offices
from
dark
airless
east
end
rooms
to
countless
factories
that
pour
out
semifraudulent
unnecessary
wares
upon
the
world
explosives
and
weapons
to
destroy
another
nation
or
cheapjack
goods
to
poison
their
own
all
in
a
few
minutes
less
than
they
could
do
it
the
week
before
and
then
he
thought
of
the
leisure
of
the
country
folk
and
of
those
who
knew
how
to
be
content
without
external
possessions
to
watch
the
sunset
and
the
dawn
with
hearts
that
sought
realities
sharing
the
noble
slowness
of
the
seasons
the
gradual
growth
of
flowers
trees
and
crops
the
unhurried
dignity
of
nature
grand
procession
the
of
the
the
calmness
of
the
unhastening
earth
once
more
possessed
his
soul
in
peace
he
hid
the
paper
watching
the
quiet
way
the
night
beyond
his
window
buried
it
from
sight
and
through
that
open
window
came
the
perfume
and
the
mighty
hand
of
darkness
slowly
it
seemed
to
this
imaginative
irishman
that
he
caught
a
sound
of
awful
laughter
from
the
mountains
and
the
sea
a
laughter
that
brought
too
a
wave
of
sighing
of
deep
and
sighing
and
before
he
went
to
sleep
he
took
an
antidote
in
the
form
of
a
page
from
that
book
that
accompanied
all
his
travels
a
book
which
was
written
wholly
in
the
open
air
because
its
message
refused
to
come
to
the
heart
of
the
inspired
writer
within
doors
try
as
he
would
the
sky
especially
containing
for
me
the
key
the
inspiration
and
the
fragment
that
he
read
expressed
a
little
bit
of
his
own
thought
and
feeling
the
seer
who
wrote
it
looked
ahead
naming
it
after
civilization
whereas
he
looked
back
but
they
saw
the
same
vision
the
confusion
of
time
was
nothing
in
the
first
soft
winds
of
spring
while
snow
yet
lay
on
the
ground
forth
from
the
city
into
the
great
woods
wandering
into
the
great
silent
white
woods
where
they
waited
in
their
beauty
and
majesty
for
man
their
companion
to
come
there
in
vision
out
of
the
wreck
of
cities
and
civilizations
slowly
out
of
the
ruins
of
the
past
out
of
the
litter
and
muck
of
a
decaying
world
lo
even
so
i
saw
a
new
life
arise
o
sound
of
waters
jubilant
pouring
pouring
o
hidden
song
in
the
hollows
secret
of
the
earth
swelling
sobbing
to
divulge
itself
slowly
building
lifting
itself
up
atom
by
atom
gathering
itself
round
a
new
center
or
rather
round
the
center
once
more
revealed
i
saw
a
new
life
a
new
society
arise
man
i
saw
arising
once
more
to
dwell
with
nature
the
old
old
story
the
prodigal
son
returning
so
loved
the
long
estrangement
the
long
entanglement
in
vain
things
the
child
returning
to
its
home
companion
of
the
winter
woods
once
more
companion
of
the
stars
and
waters
hearing
their
words
at
more
than
all
science
ever
taught
the
near
contact
the
dear
dear
mother
so
close
the
twilight
sky
and
the
young
against
it
the
few
needs
the
exhilarated
radiant
life
the
food
and
population
question
giving
no
more
trouble
no
hurry
more
no
striving
one
to
the
other
man
the
companion
of
nature
civilization
behind
him
now
the
wonderful
stretch
of
the
past
continents
empires
religions
wars
migrations
all
gathered
up
in
him
the
immense
knowledge
the
vast
winged
powers
to
use
or
not
to
use
and
as
he
fell
asleep
at
length
it
seemed
there
came
a
sound
of
hushed
huge
trampling
underneath
his
window
and
that
when
he
rose
to
listen
his
big
friend
from
the
steamer
led
him
forth
into
the
darkness
that
those
shapes
of
cloud
and
wind
he
now
so
often
saw
companioned
them
across
the
heights
of
the
night
toward
some
place
in
the
distant
mountains
where
light
and
flowers
were
and
all
his
dream
of
years
most
exquisitely
fulfilled
he
slept
and
through
his
sleep
there
dropped
the
words
of
that
old
tribesman
from
the
wilderness
they
come
in
the
spring
and
are
very
swift
and
roaring
they
are
older
older
than
the
stones
they
can
not
die
they
are
of
the
mountains
and
you
must
hide
but
the
knows
no
hiding
and
though
memory
failed
to
report
with
detail
in
the
morning
woke
refreshed
and
blessed
knowing
that
companionship
awaited
him
and
that
once
he
found
the
courage
to
escape
completely
the
simple
life
of
earth
would
claim
him
in
full
consciousness
stahl
with
his
little
modern
intellect
was
no
longer
there
to
hinder
and
prevent
xxvii
far
very
far
steer
by
my
star
leaving
the
loud
world
hurry
and
clamor
in
the
waits
you
maybe
the
isles
of
glamour
where
beauty
reigns
from
coasts
of
commerce
and
towns
of
traffic
by
wide
seas
parted
past
shoals
unmapped
and
by
reefs
uncharted
the
my
isle
attains
each
soul
may
find
faith
to
her
mind
seek
you
the
peace
of
the
groves
elysian
or
the
ivy
twine
and
the
wands
of
vine
the
dionysian
orphic
rite
to
share
the
joy
of
the
maenad
leaping
in
frenzied
train
thro
the
dusk
glen
sweeping
the
dance
and
the
sleeping
or
temple
keeping
in
vestal
white
ye
who
regret
suns
that

lo
each
god
of
the
ages
golden

is
enshrined
ageless
and

unbeholden

dark
years

their
faithful
oracles

and

from
peregrina
song
for
the
next
month
terence
possessed
his
soul
in
patience
he
worked
and
the
work
saved
him
that
is
to
say
it
enabled
him
to
keep
what
men
call
balanced
stahl
had
whether
intentionally
or
not
he
was
never
quite
certain
raised
a
tempest
in
him
more
accurately
perhaps
he
had
called
it
to
the
top
for
it
had
been
raging
deep
down
ever
since
he
could
remember
or
had
begun
to
think
that
the
earth
might
be
a
living
sentient
organism
though
too
vast
to
be
envisaged
as
such
by
normal
human
consciousness
had
always
been
a
tenet
of
his
imagination
creed
now
he
knew
it
true
as
a
is
true
that
deep
yearnings
impossible
of
satisfaction
in
the
external
conditions
of
ordinary
life
could
know
subjective
fulfillment
in
the
mind
had
always
been
for
him
poetically
true
as
for
any
other
poet
now
he
realized
that
it
was
literally
true
for
some
outlying
tract
of
consciousness
usually
inactive
termed
by
some
transliminal
spiritual
nostalgia
provided
the
channel
and
the
transfer
of
consciousness
to
this
outlying
tract
involving
of
course
a
trance
condition
of
the
usual
self
indicated
the
way
that
was
all
again
his
mystical
temperament
had
always
seen
objects
as
forces
which
from
some
invisible
center
push
outwards
into
visible
shape
as
bodies
bodies
of
trees
stones
flowers
men
women
animals
and
others
but
partially
pushed
outwards
still
invisible
to
limited
physical
sight
at
least
either
too
huge
too
small
or
too
attenuated
for
vision
whereas
now
as
a
result
of
stahl
and
fechner
combined
it
flamed
into
him
that
this
was
positively
true
more
that
there
was
a
point
in
his
transliminal
consciousness
where
he
might
contact
these
forces
before
they
reached
their
cruder
external
expression
as
bodies
nature
in
this
sense
had
always
been
for
him
alive
though
he
had
allowed
himself
the
term
by
a
long
stretch
of
poetic
sympathy
but
now
he
knew
that
it
was
actually
true
because
objects
landscapes
humans
and
the
rest
were
verily
aspects
of
the
collective
consciousness
of
the
earth
moods
of
her
spirit
phases
of
her
being
expressions
of
her
deep
pure
passionate
heart
projections
of
herself
he
pondered
lingeringly
over
this
common
words
revealed
their
open
faces
to
him
he
saw
the
ideas
behind
language
saw
them
naked
repetition
had
robbed
them
of
so
much
that
now
became
vital
like
bible
phrases
that
too
great
familiarity
in
childhood
kills
for
all
subsequent
life
as
meaningless
his
eyes
were
opened
perhaps
he
took
a
flower
into
his
mind
and
thought
about
it
really
thought
meditated
lovingly
a
flower
was
literally
projected
by
the
earth
so
far
as
its
form
was
concerned
its
roots
gathered
soil
and
changing
them
into
leaves
and
blossoms
its
leaves
again
took
of
the
atmosphere
also
a
part
of
the
earth
it
was
projected
by
the
earth
born
of
her
fed
by
her
and
at
death
returned
into
her
but
this
was
its
outward
and
visible
form
only
the
flower
for
his
imaginative
mind
was
a
force
made
visible
as
literally
as
a
house
was
a
force
the
mind
of
the
architect
made
visible
in
the
mind
or
consciousness
of
the
earth
this
flower
first
lay
latent
as
a
dream
perhaps
in
her
consciousness
it
nested
as
that
which
in
us
corresponds
to
a
little
thought
and
from
this
he
leaped
as
the
way
ever
was
with
him
to
bigger
projections
trees
atmosphere
clouds
winds
some
visible
some
invisible
and
so
to
a
deeper
yet
simpler
comprehension
of
fechner
thundering
conception
of
human
beings
as
projections
was
he
then
literally
a
child
of
the
earth
mothered
by
the
whole
magnificent
planet
all
the
world
akin
that
seeking
for
an
eternal
home
in
every
human
heart
explained
and
were
there
had
there
been
rather
these
other
vaster
projections
stahl
had
adumbrated
with
his
sudden
borrowed
stretch
of
vision
forces
thoughts
moods
of
her
hidden
life
invisible
to
sight
yet
able
to
be
felt
and
known
interiorly
that
the
gods
were
definitely
knowable
powers
accessible
to
any
genuine
worshipper
had
ever
haunted
his
mind
thinly
separated
only
from
definite
belief
now
he
understood
that
this
also
had
been
true
though
only
partially
divined
before
for
now
he
saw
them
as
the
rare
expressions
of
the
earth
in
the
morning
of
her
life
that
he
might
ever
come
to
know
them
close
made
him
tremble
with
a
fearful
joy
the
idea
flaming
across
his
being
with
a
dazzling
brilliance
that
brought
him
close
to
that
state
of
consciousness
termed
ecstasy
and
that
in
certain
unique
beings
outwardly
human
like
his
friend
there
might
still
survive
some
primitive
expression
of
the
lesser
than
the
gods
and
intermediate
as
it
were
became
for
him
now
a
fact
wondrous
even
holy
but
still
a
fact
that
he
could
grasp
he
had
found
one
such
and
stahl
by
warnings
that
fought
with
urging
invitation
at
the
same
time
had
confirmed
it
it
was
singular
he
reflected
how
worship
had
ever
turned
for
him
a
landscape
or
a
scene
enchantingly
alive
worship
he
now
understood
of
course
invited
the
gods
and
was
the
channel
through
which
their
manifestation
became
possible
to
the
soul
all
the
gods
then
were
accessible
in
this
interior
way
but
pan
especially
in
desolate
places
and
secret
corners
of
a
wood
he
remembered
dimly
the
greek
idea
of
worship
in
the
mysteries
that
the
worshipper
knew
actual
temporary
union
with
his
deity
in
ecstasy
and
at
death
went
permanently
into
his
sphere
of
being
he
understood
that
worship
was
au
fond
a
desire
for
loss
of
personal
life
hence
its
subtle
joy
and
a
fear
lest
it
be
actually
accomplished
whence
its
awe
and
wonder
some
glorious
winged
thing
moved
now
beside
him
it
held
him
by
the
hand
the
earth
possessed
him
and
the
whole
adventure
so
far
as
he
can
make
it
plain
was
an
authoritative
summons
to
the
natural
simple
life
for
the
next
month
therefore
unhurrying
blessed
with
a
deeper
sense
of
happiness
than
he
had
ever
known
before
dismissed
the
tempest
from
his
surface
consciousness
and
set
to
work
to
gather
the
picturesque
impressions
of
strange
places
and
strange
peoples
that
the
public
liked
to
read
about
in
occasional
letters
of
travel
and
by
the
time
may
had
passed
into
june
he
had
moved
up
and
down
the
caucasus
observing
learning
expanding
and
gathering
in
the
process
through
every
sense
through
the
very
pores
of
his
skin
almost
draughts
of
a
new
and
abundant
life
that
is
to
be
had
there
merely
for
the
asking
that
modification
of
the
personality
which
comes
even
in
cities
to
all
but
the
utterly
hidebound
so
that
a
man
in
rome
finds
himself
not
quite
the
same
as
he
was
in
london
or
in
paris
a
few
days
before
went
forward
in
him
on
a
profounder
scale
than
anything
he
had
known
hitherto
nature
fed
stimulated
and
called
him
with
a
passionate
intimacy
that
destroyed
all
sense
of
loneliness
and
with
a
vehement
directness
of
attack
that
simply
charged
him
to
the
brim
with
a
new
joy
of
living
his
vitality
powers
even
his
physical
health
stood
at
their
best
and
highest
the
country
laid
its
spell
upon
him
in
a
word
and
if
he
expresses
it
thus
with
some
intensity
it
was
because
life
came
to
him
so
his
record
is
the
measure
of
his
vision
those
who
find
exaggeration
in
it
merely
confess
thereby
their
own
smaller
capacity
of
living
here
as
he
wandered
to
and
fro
among
these
proud
immense
secluded
valleys
through
remote
and
untamed
forests
and
by
the
banks
of
wild
rivers
that
shook
their
flying
foam
across
untrodden
banks
he
wandered
at
the
same
time
deeper
and
ever
deeper
into
himself
toward
a
point
where
he
lost
touch
with
all
that
constituted
him
modern
or
held
him
captive
in
the
spirit
of
today
nearer
and
ever
nearer
he
moved
into
some
tremendous
freedom
some
state
of
innocence
and
simplicity
that
while
gloriously
unrestrained
yet
knew
no
touch
of
license
dreams
had
whispered
of
it
childhood
had
fringed
its
frontiers
longings
had
even
mapped
it
faintly
to
his
mind
but
now
he
breathed
its
very
air
and
knew
it
face
to
face
the
earth
surged
wonderfully
about
him
with
his
upon
a
small
caucasian
horse
a
sack
to
hold
his
cooking
things
a
pistol
in
his
belt
he
wandered
thus
for
days
sleeping
beneath
the
stars
seeing
the
sunset
and
the
dawn
drenched
in
new
strength
and
wonder
all
the
time
here
he
touched
deeper
reaches
of
the
earth
that
spoke
of
old
old
things
that
yet
were
still
young
because
they
knew
not
change
he
walked
in
the
morning
of
the
world
through
her
primal
fire
and
dew
when
all
was
a
first
and
giant
garden
the
advertised
splendors
of
other
lands
even
of
india
egypt
and
the
east
seemed
almost
vulgar
beside
this
country
that
had
somehow
held
itself
aloof
unstained
and
clean
the
civilization
of
its
little
towns
seemed
but
a
coated
varnish
that
an
hour
sun
would
melt
away
the
railway
crawling
along
the
flanks
of
the
great
range
but
a
ribbon
of
old
iron
pinned
on
that
with
the
first
shiver
of
those
giant
sides
would
split
and
vanish
here
where
the
argonauts
once
landed
the
golden
fleece
still
shone
nights
in
the
depths
of
the
rustling
beech
woods
along
the
shores
of
that
old
phasis
their
figures
might
still
be
seen
tall
jason
in
the
lead
erect
and
silvery
passing
the
shining
flowered
fields
upon
their
quest
of
ancient
beauty
further
north
from
this
sunny
colchian
strand
rose
the
peak
of
kasbek
gaunt
and
desolate
pyramid
of
iron
sloping
through
five
great
zones
of
climate
whence
the
ghost
of
prometheus
still
gazed
down
from
his
vast
frozen
precipice
upon
a
world
his
courage
would
redeem
for
somewhere
here
was
the
cradle
of
the
human
race
fair
garden
of
some
edened
life
before
the
fall
when
the
earth
sang
for
joy
in
her
first
golden
youth
and
her
soul
expressed
itself
in
mighty
forms
that
remain
for
lesser
days
but
a
faded
hierarchy
of
visioned
gods
a
living
earth
went
with
him
everywhere
with
love
that
never
breathed
alarm
it
seemed
he
felt
her
very
thoughts
within
himself
thoughts
however
that
now
no
longer
married
with
a
visible
expression
as
shapes
among
these
tribes
and
peoples
with
their
babble
of
difficult
tongues
wonder
and
beauty
terror
and
worship
still
lay
too
deeply
buried
to
have
as
yet
externalized
themselves
in
mental
forms
as
legend
myth
and
story
in
the
blood
ran
all
their
richness
undiluted
life
was
simple
full
charged
with
an
immense
delight
at
home
little
cocksure
writers
in
little
cocksure
journals
pertly
modern
and
enlightened
might
dictate
how
far
imaginative
vision
and
belief
could
go
before
they
overstepped
the
limits
of
an
artificial
schedule
but
here
everything
possible
to
be
believed
was
still
an
image
of
truth
and
the
stream
of
life
flowed
deeper
than
all
mere
intellectual
denials
a
little
out
of
sight
but
thinly
veiled
the
powers
that
in
this
haunted
corner
of
the
earth
too
strangely
neglected
pushed
outwards
into
men
and
trees
into
mountains
flowers
and
the
rest
were
unenslaved
and
intensely
vital
in
his
blood
knew
the
primal
pulses
of
the
world
it
was
irresistibly
seductive
whether
he
slept
with
the
aryan
ossetians
upon
the
high
ridges
of
the
central
range
or
shared
the
stone
huts
of
the
mountain
jews
unchanged
since
bible
days
beyond
the
suram
heights
there
came
to
all
his
senses
the
message
of
that
golden
age
his
longings
ever
sought
the
rush
and
murmur
of
the
calling
and
so
it
was
about
the
first
week
in
june
that
lean
bronzed
and
in
perfect
physical
condition
this
wandering
irishman
found
himself
in
a
little
swanetian
hamlet
beyond
alighir
preparing
with
a
georgian
to
penetrate
yet
deeper
into
the
mountain
recesses
and
feed
his
heart
with
what
he
found
of
loneliness
and
beauty
this
region
of
imerethia
bordering
on
mingrelia
is
smothered
beneath
an
exuberance
of
vegetation
almost
tropical
blue
and
golden
with
enormous
flowers
tangled
with
wild
vines
rich
with
towering
soft
beech
woods
and
finally
in
the
upper
sections
ablaze
with
leagues
of
huge
rhododendron
trees
in
blossom
that
give
whole
the
aspect
of
a
giant
garden
flowering
amid
peaks
that
even
dwarf
the
alps
for
here
the
original
garden
of
the
world
survives
run
wild
with
pristine
loveliness
the
prodigality
of
nature
is
bewildering
almost
troubling
there
are
valleys
rarely
entered
by
the
foot
of
man
where
monstrous
lilies
topping
a
man
on
foot
and
even
reaching
to
his
shoulder
on
horseback
have
suggested
to
botanists
in
their
lavish
luxuriance
a
survival
of
the
original
flora
of
the
world
a
thousand
flowers
he
found
whose
names
he
had
never
heard
of
their
hues
and
forms
as
strangely
lovely
as
those
of
another
planet
the
grasses
alone
in
scale
and
mass
were
magnificent
while
in
and
out
of
all
this
splendor
less
dense
and
voluminous
only
than
the
rhododendron
forests
ran
scattered
lines
of
blazing
yellow
the
crowding
clusters
of
azalea
bushes
that
scented
the
winds
beyond
belief
beyond
this
region
of
extravagance
in
size
and
color
there
ran
immense
bare
open
slopes
of
smooth
turf
that
led
to
the
foot
of
the
eternal
snowfields
with
far
below
valleys
of
prodigious
scale
and
steepness
that
touched
somehow
with
disdain
all
memory
of
other
mountain
ranges
he
had
ever
known
and
here
it
was
this
warm
june
evening
june
it
was
while
packing
his
sack
with
cheese
and
in
the
dirty
yard
of
a
more
hindered
than
helped
by
his
georgian
guide
that
he
realized
the
approach
of
a
familiar
bearded
figure
the
figure
emerged
there
was
a
sudden
clutch
and
lift
of
the
heart
then
a
rush
of
wild
delight
there
stood
his
russian
part
of
the
scale
and
splendor
as
though
grown
out
of
the
very
soil
he
occupied
in
a
flash
the
middle
of
the
picture
he
gave
it
meaning
he
was
part
of
it
exactly
as
a
tree
or
big
grey
boulder
were
part
of
it
xxviii

novalis
translated
by
notwithstanding
the
extent
and
loneliness
of
this
wild
country
coincidence
seemed
in
no
way
stretched
by
the
abrupt
appearance
for
in
a
sense
it
was
not
wholly
unexpected
there
had
been
certain
indications
that
the
meeting
again
of
these
two
was
imminent
the
irishman
had
never
doubted
they
would
meet
but
something
more
than
mere
hints
or
warnings
it
seemed
had
prepared
him
the
nature
of
these
warnings
however
never
fully
disclosed
two
of
them
he
told
to
me
by
word
of
mouth
but
there
were
others
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
speak
about
at
all
even
the
two
he
mentioned
do
not
appear
in
his
written
account
his
hesitation
is
not
easy
to
explain
unless
it
be
that
language
collapsed
in
the
attempt
to
describe
occurrences
so
remote
from
common
experience
this
may
be
so
although
he
grappled
not
unsuccessfully
with
the
rest
of
the
amazing
adventure
at
any
rate
i
could
never
coax
from
him
more
than
the
confession
that
there
other
things
that
had
brought
him
hints
then
came
a
laugh
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
an
expression
of
confused
bewilderment
in
eyes
and
manner
and
silence
the
two
he
spoke
of
i
report
as
best
i
can
on
the
roof
of
that
london
where
so
many
of
our
talks
took
place
beneath
the
stars
and
to
the
tune
of
bustling
modern
traffic
he
told
them
to
me
both
were
consistent
with
his
theory
that
he
was
becoming
daily
more
active
in
some
outlying
portion
of
his
personality
knowing
experiences
in
a
region
of
extended
consciousness
stimulated
so
powerfully
by
his
strange
new
friend
both
moreover
brought
him
one
and
the
same
conviction
that
he
was
no
longer
alone
for
some
days
past
he
had
realized
this
more
than
his
peasant
guide
accompanied
him
he
was
both
companioned
and
observed
a
dozen
times
he
said
i
thought
i
saw
him
and
a
dozen
times
i
was
mistaken
but
my
mind
looked
for
him
i
knew
that
he
was
somewhere
close
he
compared
the
feeling
to
that
common
experience
of
the
streets
when
a
friend
not
known
to
be
near
or
even
expected
comes
abruptly
into
the
thoughts
so
that
numberless
individuals
may
trick
the
sight
with
his
appearance
before
he
himself
comes
suddenly
down
the
pavement
his
approach
has
reached
the
mind
before
his
mere
body
turns
the
corner
something
in
me
was
aware
of
his
approach
he
added
as
though
his
being
were
sending
out
feelers
in
advance
to
find
me
they
reached
me
first
i
think
he
hesitated
briefly
hunting
for
a
more
accurate
term
he
could
not
find
in
dream
you
dreamed
that
he
was
coming
then
it
came
first
in
dream
he
answered
only
when
i
woke
the
dream
did
not
fade
it
passed
over
into
waking
consciousness
so
that
i
could
hardly
tell
where
the
threshold
lay
between
the
two
and
meanwhile
i
was
always
expecting
to
see
him
at
every
turn
of
the
trail
almost
a
little
higher
up
the
mountain
behind
a
rock
or
standing
beside
a
tree
just
as
in
the
end
i
actually
did
see
him
long
before
he
emerged
in
this
way
he
had
been
close
about
me
guiding
waiting
watching
he
told
it
as
a
true
thing
he
did
not
quite
expect
me
to
believe
yet
in
a
sense
sense
i
could
and
did
believe
it
it
was
so
wholly
consistent
with
the
tenor
of
his
adventure
and
the
condition
of
abnormal
receptivity
of
mind
for
his
stretched
consciousness
was
in
a
state
of
white
sensitiveness
whereon
the
tenderest
mental
force
of
thought
might
well
record
its
signature
acutely
impressionable
he
was
all
over
physical
distance
was
of
as
little
or
even
of
less
account
to
such
forces
as
it
is
to
electricity
but
it
was
more
than
the
russian
who
was
close
he
added
quietly
with
one
of
those
sentences
that
startled
me
into
keen
attention
he
was
there
with
others
of
his
kind
and
then
hardly
pausing
to
take
breath
he
plunged
as
his
manner
was
full
tilt
into
the
details
of
this
first
experience
that
thrilled
my
hedging
soul
with
an
astonishing
power
of
conviction
as
always
when
his
heart
was
in
the
words
the
scenery
about
us
faded
and
i
lived
the
adventure
with
him
the
cowled
and
hooded
chimneys
turned
to
trees
the
stretch
of
dim
london
park
became
a
deep
caucasian
vale
the
thunder
of
the
traffic
was
the
roaring
of
the
torrents
the
very
perfume
of
strange
flowers
floated
in
the
air
they
had
been
in
their
blankets
he
and
his
peasant
guide
for
hours
and
a
moon
approaching
the
full
still
concealed
all
signs
of
dawn
when
he
woke
out
of
deep
sleep
with
the
odd
sensation
that
it
was
only
a
part
of
him
that
woke
one
portion
of
him
was
in
the
body
while
another
portion
was
elsewhere
manifesting
with
ease
and
freedom
in
some
state
or
region
whither
he
had
traveled
in
his
sleep
where
moreover
he
had
not
been
alone
and
close
about
him
in
the
trees
was
movement
yes
through
and
between
the
scattered
trunks
he
saw
it
still
with
eyes
a
little
dazed
the
active
portion
of
his
brain
perceived
this
processing
movement
passing
to
and
fro
across
the
glades
of
moonlight
beneath
the
steady
trees
for
there
was
no
wind
the
shadows
of
the
branches
did
not
stir
he
saw
swift
running
shapes
vigorous
yet
silent
hurrying
across
the
network
of
splashed
silver
and
pools
of
black
in
some
kind
of
organized
movement
that
was
circular
and
seemed
not
due
to
chance
arranged
it
seemed
and
ordered
like
the
regulated
revolutions
of
a
set
and
whirling
measure
perhaps
twenty
feet
from
where
he
lay
was
the
outer
fringe
of
what
he
discerned
to
be
this
fragment
of
some
grand
gamboling
dance
or
frolic
yet
discerned
but
dimly
for
the
darkness
combined
with
his
uncertain
vision
to
obscure
it
and
the
shapes
as
they
sped
across
the
silvery
patchwork
of
the
moon
seemed
curiously
familiar
beyond
question
he
recognized
and
knew
them
for
they
were
akin
to
those
shadowy
emanations
seen
weeks
ago
upon
the
steamer
to
that
messenger
who
climbed
from
out
the
sea
and
sky
and
to
that
form
the
spirit
of
the
boy
assumed
set
free
in
death
they
were
the
flying
outlines
of
wind
and
cloud
he
had
so
often
glimpsed
in
vision
racing
over
the
long
bare
open
hills
at
last
come
near
in
the
moment
of
first
waking
when
he
saw
them
clearest
he
declares
with
emphasis
that
he
the
father
and
the
boy
were
among
them
not
so
much
that
he
saw
them
actually
for
recognition
but
rather
that
he
felt
their
rushing
presences
for
the
first
sensation
on
opening
his
eyes
was
the
conviction
that
both
had
passed
him
close
had
almost
touched
and
called
him
afterwards
he
searched
in
vain
among
the
flying
forms
that
swept
in
the
swift
succession
of
their
leaping
dance
across
the
silvery
pathways
while
varying
in
size
all
were
so
similar
his
description
of
them
is
confused
a
little
for
he
admits
that
he
could
never
properly
focus
them
in
steady
sight
they
slipped
with
a
melting
swiftness
under
the
eye
the
moment
one
seemed
caught
in
vision
it
passed
on
further
and
the
next
was
in
its
place
it
was
like
following
a
running
on
the
sea
he
says
moreover
that
while
erect
and
splendid
their
backs
and
shoulders
seemed
prolonged
in
hugeness
as
though
they
often
crouched
to
spring
they
seemed
to
paw
the
air
and
that
a
faint
delicious
sound
to
which
they
kept
obedient
time
and
rhythm
held
that
same
sweetness
which
had
issued
from
the
hills
of
greece
blown
down
now
among
the
trees
from
very
far
away
and
when
he
says
blown
down
among
the
trees
he
qualifies
this
phrase
as
well
because
at
the
same
time
it
came
to
him
that
the
sound
also
rose
up
from
underneath
the
earth
as
if
the
very
surface
of
the
ground
ran
shaking
with
a
soft
vibration
of
its
own
some
marvelous
dream
it
might
have
been
in
which
the
forms
the
movement
and
the
sound
were
all
thrown
up
and
outwards
from
the
quivering
surface
of
the
earth
itself
yet
almost
simultaneously
with
the
first
instant
of
waking
the
body
issued
its
call
of
warning
for
while
he
gazed
and
before
time
for
the
least
reflection
came
the
irishman
experienced
this
dislocating
conviction
that
he
himself
was
taking
part
in
the
whirling
gambol
even
while
he
lay
and
watched
it
and
that
in
this
way
the
sense
of
division
in
his
personality
was
explained
the
fragment
of
himself
within
the
brain
watched
some
other
more
vital
fragment
some
projection
of
his
consciousness
detached
and
separate
playing
yonder
with
its
kind
beneath
the
moon
this
sense
of
a
divided
self
was
not
new
to
him
but
never
before
had
he
known
it
so
distinct
and
overwhelming
the
definiteness
of
the
division
as
well
as
the
importance
and
vitality
of
the
separated
portion
were
arrestingly
novel
it
felt
as
though
he
were
completely
out
or
to
such
a
degree
at
least
that
the
fraction
left
behind
with
the
brain
was
at
first
only
just
sufficient
for
him
to
recognize
his
body
at
all
yonder
with
these
others
he
felt
the
wind
of
movement
pass
along
his
back
he
saw
the
trees
slip
by
and
knew
the
very
contact
of
the
ground
between
the
leaps
his
movements
were
natural
and
easy
light
as
air
and
fast
as
wind
they
seemed
automatic
impelled
by
something
mighty
that
directed
and
contained
them
he
knew
too
the
sensation
that
others
pressed
behind
him
and
passed
before
slipped
in
and
out
and
that
through
the
whole
wild
urgency
of
it
he
yet
could
never
make
an
error
more
he
knew
that
these
shifting
forms
had
been
close
and
dancing
about
him
for
a
time
not
measurable
merely
by
the
hours
of
a
single
night
that
in
a
sense
they
were
always
there
though
he
had
but
just
discovered
them
his
earlier
glimpses
had
been
a
very
partial
divination
of
a
truth
immense
and
beautiful
that
now
dawned
quite
gorgeously
upon
him
all
complete
the
whole
world
danced
the
universe
was
rhythmical
as
well
as
metrical
for
this
amazing
splendor
showed
itself
in
a
revelation
to
the
freed
portion
of
his
consciousness
and
he
knew
it
irresistibly
because
he
himself
shared
it
here
was
an
infinite
joy
naked
and
unashamed
born
of
the
mighty
mother
heart
and
life
a
joy
which
in
its
feebler
lesser
manifestations
trickles
down
into
human
conditions
though
still
spontaneously
even
then
so
pure
its
primal
urgency
as
dancing
the
entire
experience
the
entire
revelation
he
thinks
can
have
occupied
but
a
fraction
of
a
second
but
it
seemed
to
smite
the
whole
of
his
being
at
once
with
the
conviction
of
a
supreme
authority
and
close
behind
it
came
too
that
other
sister
expression
of
a
spontaneous
and
natural
expression
equally
rhythmical
the
impulse
to
sing
he
could
have
sung
aloud
for
this
puissant
and
mysterious
rhythm
to
which
all
moved
was
greater
than
any
little
measure
of
their
own
surging
through
them
it
came
from
outside
and
beyond
infinitely
greater
than
themselves
springing
from
something
of
which
they
were
nevertheless
a
living
portion
from
the
body
of
the
earth
it
came
direct
it
was
in
fact
a
manifestation
of
her
own
vibrating
life
the
currents
of
the
earth
pulsed
through
them
and
then
he
says
i
caught
this
flaming
thought
of
wonder
though
so
much
of
it
faded
instantly
upon
my
full
awakening
that
i
can
only
give
you
the
merest
suggestion
of
what
it
was
he
stood
up
beside
me
as
he
said
it
spreading
his
arms
as
so
often
when
he
was
excited
to
the
sky
i
caught
the
glow
of
his
eyes
and
in
his
voice
was
passion
he
spoke
unquestionably
of
something
he
had
intimately
known
not
as
men
speak
of
even
the
vividest
dreams
but
of
realities
that
have
burned
the
heart
and
left
their
trails
of
glory
science
has
guessed
some
inkling
of
the
truth
he
cried
when
it
declares
that
the
ultimate
molecules
of
matter
are
in
constant
vibratory
movement
one
about
another
even
upon
the
point
of
a
needle
but
i
saw
rather
as
if
i
had
always
known
it
sweet
as
summer
rain
and
close
in
me
as
love
that
the
whole
earth
with
all
her
myriad
expressions
of
life
moved
to
this
primal
rhythm
as
of
some
divine
dancing
dancing
i
asked
puzzled
rhythmical
movement
call
it
then
he
replied
to
share
the
life
of
the
earth
is
to
dance
and
sing
in
a
huge
abundant
joy
and
the
nearer
to
her
great
heart
the
more
natural
and
spontaneous
the
impulse
the
instinctive
dancing
of
primitive
races
of
savages
and
children
still
artless
and
untamed
the
gamboling
of
animals
of
rabbits
in
the
meadows
and
of
deer
unwatched
in
forest
clearings
you
know
naturalists
have
sometimes
seen
it
of
birds
in
the
air
rooks
gulls
and
swallows
of
the
life
within
the
sea
even
of
gnats
in
the
haze
of
summer
afternoons
all
life
simple
enough
to
touch
and
share
the
enormous
happiness
of
her
deep
streaming
personal
being
dances
instinctively
for
very
joy
obedient
to
a
greater
measure
than
they
know
the
natural
movement
of
the
great
is
rhythmical
the
very
winds
the
swaying
of
trees
and
flowers
and
grasses
the
movement
of
the
sea
of
water
running
through
the
fields
with
silver
feet
of
the
clouds
and
edges
of
the
mist
even
the
trembling
of
the
earthquakes
all
all
respond
in
sympathetic
motions
to
this
huge
vibratory
movement
of
her
great
central
pulse
ay
and
the
mountains
too
though
so
vastly
scaled
their
measure
that
perhaps
we
only
know
the
pauses
in
between
and
think
them
motionless
the
mountains
rise
and
fall
and
change
our
very
breathing
first
sign
of
stirring
life
even
the
circulation
of
our
blood
bring
testimony
our
speech
as
well
inspired
words
are
ever
rhythmical
language
that
pours
into
the
poet
mind
from
something
greater
than
himself
and
not
unwisely
but
in
obedience
to
a
deep
instinctive
knowledge
was
dancing
once
in
earlier
simpler
days
a
form
of
worship
you
know
at
least
how
rhythm
in
music
and
ceremonial
uplifts
and
cleans
and
simplifies
the
heart
toward
the
greater
life
you
know
perhaps
the
dance
of
jesus
the
words
poured
from
him
with
passion
yet
always
uttered
gently
with
a
smile
of
joy
upon
the
face
i
saw
his
figure
standing
over
me
outlined
against
the
starry
sky
and
deeply
stirred
i
listened
with
delight
and
wonder
rhythm
surely
lies
behind
all
expression
of
life
he
was
on
the
heels
of
some
simple
dazzling
verity
though
he
phrased
it
wildly
but
not
a
tenth
part
of
all
he
said
could
i
recapture
afterwards
for
writing
down
the
steady
gentle
swaying
of
his
body
i
remember
clearly
and
that
somewhere
or
other
in
the
stream
of
language
he
made
apt
reference
to
the
rhythmical
swaying
of
those
who
speak
in
trance
or
know
some
strange
possessing
gust
of
inspiration
the
first
and
natural
expression
of
the
earth
vitality
lies
in
a
dancing
movement
of
purest
joy
and
happiness
that
for
me
is
the
gist
of
what
remains
those
near
enough
to
nature
feel
it
i
myself
remembered
days
in
spring
my
thoughts
borne
upon
some
sweet
emotion
traveled
far
and
not
of
the
earth
alone
he
interrupted
my
dreaming
in
a
voice
like
singing
but
of
the
entire
universe
the
spheres
and
constellations
weave
across
the
fields
of
ether
the
immense
old
rhythm
of
their
divine
eternal
dance
then
with
a
disconcerting
abruptness
and
a
strange
little
wayward
laugh
as
of
apology
for
having
let
himself
so
freely
go
he
sat
down
beside
me
with
his
back
against
the
he
resumed
more
quietly
the
account
of
this
particular
adventure
that
lay
dream
and
waking
all
that
he
described
had
happened
in
a
few
seconds
it
flashed
complete
authoritative
and
vivid
then
passed
away
he
knew
again
the
call
and
warning
of
his
body
to
return
for
this
consciousness
of
being
in
two
places
at
once
divided
as
it
were
against
himself
brought
with
it
the
necessity
for
decision
with
which
portion
should
he
identify
himself
by
an
act
of
will
it
seemed
a
choice
was
possible
and
with
it
then
came
the
knowledge
that
to
remain
out
was
easier
than
to
return
this
time
to
come
back
into
himself
would
be
difficult
the
very
possibility
seemed
to
provide
the
shock
of
energy
necessary
for
overcoming
it
the
experience
alarmed
him
it
was
like
holding
an
option
upon
living
like
a
foretaste
of
death
automatically
as
it
were
these
loosened
forces
in
him
answered
to
the
body
summons
the
result
was
immediate
and
singular
one
of
these
dancing
outlines
separated
itself
from
the
main
herd
approached
with
a
sudden
silent
rush
enveloped
him
for
a
second
of
darkness
and
confusion
losing
its
shape
completely
on
the
way
and
then
merged
into
his
being
as
smoke
slips
in
and
merges
with
the
structure
of
a
tree
the
projected
portion
of
his
personality
had
returned
the
sense
of
division
was
gone
there
remained
behind
only
the
little
terror
of
the
weak
flesh
whose
summons
had
thus
brought
it
back
the
same
instant
he
was
fully
awake
the
night
about
him
empty
of
all
but
the
silver
dreaming
of
the
moon
among
the
shadows
beside
him
lay
the
sleeping
figure
of
his
companion
the
bashlik
of
lamb
wool
drawn
closely
down
about
the
ears
and
neck
and
the
voluminous
black
burka
shrouding
him
from
feet
to
shoulders
a
little
distance
away
the
horse
stood
munching
grass
again
he
noted
that
there
was
no
wind
and
the
shadows
of
the
trees
lay
motionless
upon
the
ground
the
air
smelt
sweet
of
forest
soil
and
dew
the
experience
it
seemed
now
belonged
to
dreaming
rather
than
to
waking
consciousness
for
there
was
nothing
about
him
to
confirm
it
outwardly
only
the
memory
remained
that
and
a
vast
subtle
happiness
the
smaller
terror
that
he
felt
was
of
the
flesh
alone
for
the
flesh
ever
instinctively
fought
against
such
separation
the
happiness
though
contained
and
overwhelmed
the
fear
yes
only
the
memory
remained
and
even
that
fast
fading
but
the
substance
of
what
had
been
passed
into
his
inmost
being
the
splendor
of
that
would
remain
forever
incorporated
with
his
life
he
had
shared
in
this
brief
moment
of
extended
consciousness
some
measure
of
the
mother
cosmic
being
simple
as
sunshine
unrestrained
as
wind
complete
and
satisfying
its
natural
expression
was
rhythmical
a
deep
pure
joy
that
drove
outwards
even
into
little
human
conditions
as
dancing
and
singing
he
had
known
it
too
with
companions
of
his
kind
moreover
though
no
longer
visible
or
audible
it
still
continued
somewhere
close
he
was
blessedly
companioned
all
the
time
and
watched
knew
him
one
of
themselves
these
brother
expressions
of
her
cosmic
life
these
beings
that
today
had
no
external
bodily
forms
they
waited
knowing
well
that
he
would
come
fulfillment
beckoned
surely
just
beyond
xxix
and
then
suddenly
while
perhaps
twice
my
heart
was
dutiful
to
send
my
blood
upon
its
little
race
i
was
exalted
above
surety
and
out
of
time
did
fall
lascelles
abercrombie
and
this
then
was
one
of
the
hints
by
which
knew
that
he
was
not
alone
and
that
the
mind
of
his
companion
was
stretched
out
to
find
him
he
became
aware
after
it
of
a
distinct
guidance
even
of
direction
as
to
his
route
of
travel
the
impulse
came
as
one
says
to
turn
northwards
and
he
obeyed
it
without
more
ado
for
this
dream
had
come
to
him
when
camped
upon
the
slopes
of
ararat
further
south
toward
the
turkish
frontier
and
though
all
prepared
to
climb
the
foot
summit
he
changed
his
plans
dismissed
the
local
guide
and
turned
back
for
tiflis
and
the
central
range
in
the
wilder
lonelier
mountains
he
felt
strongly
was
where
he
ought
to
be
another
man
of
course
would
have
dismissed
the
dream
or
forgotten
it
while
cooking
his
morning
coffee
but
rightly
or
wrongly
this
divining
celt
accepted
it
as
real
he
held
an
instinctive
belief
that
in
dreams
of
a
certain
order
the
forces
that
drive
behind
the
soul
at
a
given
moment
may
reveal
themselves
to
the
subconscious
self
becoming
authoritative
in
proportion
as
they
are
sanely
encouraged
and
interpreted
they
dramatize
themselves
in
scenes
that
are
open
to
intuitive
interpretation
and
it
seems
possessed
like
the
hebrew
prophets
of
old
just
that
measure
of
judgment
and
divination
which
go
to
the
making
of
a
true
packing
up
kit
and
dunnage
he
crossed
the
georgian
military
route
on
foot
to
vladikavkaz
and
thence
with
another
horse
and
a
mohammedan
georgian
as
guide
rostom
by
name
journeyed
alighir
and
oni
up
a
side
valley
of
unforgettable
splendor
toward
an
imerethian
hamlet
where
they
meant
to
supplies
for
a
prolonged
expedition
into
the
uninhabited
wilderness
and
here
the
second
occurrence
he
told
me
of
took
place
it
was
more
direct
than
the
first
yet
equally
strange
also
it
brought
a
similar
authority
coming
first
along
the
deep
mysterious
underpaths
of
sleep
sleep
that
short
cut
into
the
subconscious
they
were
camped
among
low
boxwood
trees
a
hot
dry
night
wind
soft
and
stars
very
brilliant
when
the
irishman
turned
in
his
and
abruptly
woke
this
time
there
was
no
dream
only
the
certainty
that
something
had
wakened
him
deliberately
he
sat
up
almost
with
a
cry
it
was
exactly
as
though
he
heard
himself
called
by
name
and
recognized
the
voice
that
spoke
it
he
looked
quickly
round
nothing
but
the
crowding
army
of
the
was
visible
some
bushy
and
round
others
straggling
in
their
outline
all
whispering
gently
together
in
the
night
beyond
ran
the
immense
slopes
and
far
overhead
he
saw
the
gleaming
snow
on
peaks
that
brushed
the
stars
no
one
was
visible
this
time
no
flying
figures
danced
beneath
the
moon
there
was
indeed
no
moon
something
however
he
knew
had
come
up
close
and
touched
him
calling
him
from
the
depths
of
a
profound
and
tired
slumber
it
had
withdrawn
again
vanished
into
the
night
the
strong
certainty
remained
though
that
it
lingered
near
about
him
still
trying
to
press
forwards
and
outwards
into
some
kind
of
objective
visible
expression
that
he
had
responded
with
an
effort
in
his
sleep
but
the
effort
had
been
unsuccessful
he
had
merely
waked
and
lost
it
the
horse
tethered
a
few
feet
away
was
astir
and
troubled
straining
at
the
rope
whinnying
faintly
and
rostom
the
georgian
peasant
he
saw
was
already
up
to
quiet
it
a
curious
perfume
passed
him
through
the
air
once
then
vanished
unforgettable
however
for
he
had
known
it
already
weeks
ago
upon
the
steamer
and
before
the
gardened
woods
about
him
smothered
it
with
their
richer
smells
of
a
million
flowers
and
weeds
he
recognized
in
it
that
peculiar
pungent
whiff
of
horse
that
had
reached
him
from
the
haunted
cabin
this
time
it
was
less
fleeting
a
fine
clean
odor
that
he
liked
even
while
it
strangely
troubled
him
kicking
out
of
his
blankets
he
joined
the
man
and
helped
to
straighten
out
the
tangled
rope
rostom
spoke
little
russian
and
knowledge
of
georgian
lay
in
a
single
phrase
look
sharp
but
with
the
aid
of
french
the
man
had
learned
from
he
gathered
that
some
one
had
approached
during
the
night
and
camped
it
seemed
not
far
away
above
them
though
unusual
enough
in
so
unfrequented
a
region
this
was
not
necessarily
alarming
and
the
first
proof
had
that
the
man
experienced
no
ordinary
physical
fear
was
the
fact
that
he
had
left
both
knife
and
rifle
in
his
blankets
hitherto
at
the
least
sign
of
danger
he
changed
into
a
perfect
arsenal
he
invariably
slept
in
his
weapons
but
now
even
in
the
darkness
the
other
noted
that
he
was
unarmed
and
therefore
it
was
no
attempt
at
or
of
assault
upon
themselves
he
feared
who
is
it
what
is
it
he
asked
stumbling
over
the
tangle
of
roots
that
netted
the
ground
natives
travelers
like
ourselves
or
something
else
he
spoke
very
low
as
though
aware
that
what
had
waked
him
still
hovered
close
enough
to
overhear
why
do
you
fear
and
rostom
looked
up
a
moment
from
stooping
over
the
rope
he
stepped
a
little
nearer
avoiding
the
animal
hoofs
in
a
confused
whisper
of
french
and
russian
making
at
the
same
time
the
protective
signs
of
his
religion
he
muttered
a
sentence
of
which
the
other
caught
little
more
than
the
unassuring
word
that
something
was
about
them
close
something
this
curious
significant
word
he
used
the
whispered
utterance
the
manner
that
went
with
it
surely
the
dark
and
lonely
setting
of
the
little
scene
as
well
served
to
convey
the
full
suggestion
of
the
adjective
with
a
force
the
man
himself
could
scarcely
have
intended
something
had
passed
by
not
so
much
evil
wicked
or
malign
as
strange
and
alien
uncanny
rostom
a
man
utterly
careless
of
physical
danger
rising
to
it
rather
with
delight
was
frightened
in
his
soul
what
do
you
mean
asked
louder
with
an
air
of
impatience
assumed
the
man
was
on
his
knees
but
whether
praying
or
merely
struggling
with
the
rope
was
hard
to
see
what
is
it
you
talking
about
so
foolishly
he
spoke
with
a
confidence
he
hardly
felt
himself
and
the
involved
reply
spoken
with
lips
against
the
earth
the
head
but
slightly
turned
as
he
knelt
again
smothered
the
words
only
the
curious
phrase
came
to
him
the
irishman
took
him
by
the
shoulders
not
meaning
actually
to
shake
him
he
yet
must
have
used
some
violence
for
the
fact
was
that
he
did
not
like
the
answers
and
sought
to
deny
some
strong
emotion
in
himself
the
man
stood
up
abruptly
with
a
kind
of
sudden
spring
the
expression
of
his
face
was
not
easily
divined
in
the
darkness
but
a
gleam
of
the
eyes
was
clearly
visible
it
may
have
been
anger
it
may
have
been
terror
vivid
excitement
it
certainly
was
something
old
as
the
stones
old
as
the
stones
he
whispered
thrusting
his
dark
bearded
face
unpleasantly
close
such
things
are
in
these
mountains
oui
moi
qui
vous
le
dis
old
as
the
stones
i
tell
you
and
sometimes
they
come
out
close
with
sudden
wind
know
he
stepped
back
again
sharply
and
dropped
upon
his
knees
bowing
to
the
ground
with
flattened
palms
he
made
a
repelling
gesture
as
though
it
was
presence
that
brought
the
experience
and
to
see
them
is
to
die
he
heard
muttered
against
the
ground
thickly
to
see
them
is
to
die
the
irishman
went
back
to
his
some
strange
passion
of
the
man
was
deeply
stirred
he
did
not
wish
to
offend
his
violent
beliefs
and
turn
it
against
himself
in
a
stupid
scrambling
fight
he
lay
and
waited
he
heard
the
muttering
of
the
deep
voice
behind
him
in
the
darkness
presently
it
ceased
rostom
came
softly
back
to
bed
knows
warned
me
he
whispered
jerking
one
hand
toward
the
horse
significantly
as
they
at
length
lay
again
side
by
side
in
their
blankets
and
the
stars
shone
down
upon
them
from
a
deep
black
sky
but
for
the
moment
they
have
passed
not
finding
us
no
wind
has
come
another
horse
asked
suggestively
with
a
sympathy
meant
to
quiet
him
but
the
peasant
shook
his
head
and
this
time
it
was
not
difficult
to
divine
the
expression
on
his
face
even
in
the
darkness
at
the
same
moment
the
tethered
animal
again
uttered
a
long
whinnying
cry
plaintive
yet
of
pleasure
rather
than
alarm
it
seemed
which
instantly
brought
the
man
again
with
a
leap
from
the
blankets
to
his
knees
did
not
go
to
help
him
he
stuffed
the
clothes
against
his
ears
and
waited
he
did
not
wish
to
hear
the
peasant
sentences
and
this
pantomime
went
on
at
intervals
for
an
hour
or
more
when
at
length
the
horse
grew
quiet
and
snatched
moments
of
unrefreshing
sleep
the
night
lay
thick
about
them
with
a
silence
like
the
silence
of
the
sky
the
boxwood
bushes
ran
together
into
a
single
sheet
of
black
the
far
peaks
faded
out
of
sight
the
air
grew
keen
and
sharp
toward
the
dawn
on
the
wave
of
wind
the
sunrise
drives
before
it
round
the
world
but
to
and
fro
across
the
irishman
mind
as
he
lay
between
sleep
and
dozing
ran
the
feeling
that
his
friends
were
close
and
that
those
dancing
forms
of
cosmic
life
to
which
all
three
approximated
had
come
near
once
more
to
summon
him
he
also
knew
that
what
the
horse
had
felt
was
something
far
from
terror
the
animal
instinctively
had
divined
the
presence
of
something
to
which
it
too
was
remotely
kin
rostom
however
remained
keenly
on
the
alert
much
of
the
time
apparently
praying
not
once
did
he
touch
the
weapons
that
lay
ready
to
hand
upon
the
folded
burka
and
when
at
last
the
dawn
came
pale
and
yellow
through
the
trees
showing
the
outlines
of
the
individual
box
and
azalea
bushes
he
got
up
earlier
than
usual
and
began
to
make
the
fire
for
coffee
in
the
fuller
light
which
soon
poured
swiftly
over
the
eastern
summits
and
dropped
gold
and
silver
into
the
tremendous
valley
at
their
feet
the
men
made
a
systematic
search
of
the
immediate
surroundings
and
then
of
the
clearings
and
more
open
stretches
beyond
in
silence
they
made
it
they
found
however
no
traces
of
another
and
it
was
clear
from
the
way
they
went
about
the
search
that
neither
expected
to
find
anything
the
ground
was
unbroken
the
bushes
undisturbed
yet
still
both
knew
that
something
which
the
night
had
brought
and
kept
concealed
still
hovered
close
about
them
and
it
was
at
this
scattered
hamlet
consisting
of
little
more
than
a
farm
of
sorts
and
a
few
shepherds
huts
of
stone
where
they
stopped
two
hours
later
for
provisions
that
looked
up
thus
suddenly
and
recognized
the
figure
of
his
friend
he
stood
among
the
trees
a
hundred
yards
away
at
first
the
other
thought
he
was
a
tree
his
stalwart
form
the
stem
his
hair
and
beard
the
branches
so
big
and
motionless
he
stood
between
the
other
trunks
saw
him
for
a
full
minute
before
he
understood
the
man
seemed
so
absolutely
a
part
of
the
landscape
a
giant
detail
in
keeping
with
the
rest
a
detail
that
had
suddenly
emerged
the
same
moment
a
great
draught
of
wind
rising
from
depths
of
the
valley
below
swept
overhead
with
a
roaring
sound
shaking
the
beech
and
box
trees
and
setting
all
the
golden
azalea
heads
in
a
sudden
agitation
it
passed
as
swiftly
as
it
came
the
peace
of
the
june
morning
again
descended
on
the
mountains
it
was
broken
by
a
wild
cry
a
cry
of
genuine
terror
for
had
turned
to
rostom
with
some
word
that
here
in
this
figure
lay
the
explanation
of
the
animal
excitement
in
the
night
when
he
saw
that
the
peasant
white
as
chalk
beneath
the
tangle
of
black
hair
that
covered
his
face
had
stopped
dead
in
his
tracks
his
mouth
was
open
his
arms
upraised
to
shield
he
was
staring
fixedly
in
the
same
direction
as
himself
the
next
instant
he
was
on
his
knees
bowing
and
scraping
toward
mecca
groaning
hiding
his
eyes
with
both
hands
the
sack
he
held
had
toppled
over
the
cheese
and
flour
rolled
upon
the
ground
and
from
the
horse
came
that
whinnying
of
the
night
there
was
a
momentary
impression
entirely
in
the
irishman
mind
of
course
that
the
whole
landscape
veiled
a
giant
rushing
movement
that
passed
across
it
like
a
wave
the
surface
of
the
earth
it
seemed
ran
softly
quivering
as
though
that
wind
had
stirred
response
together
with
the
trembling
of
the
million
leaves
before
it
settled
back
again
to
stillness
it
passed
in
the
flash
of
an
eyelid
the
earth
lay
tranquil
in
repose
but
though
the
suddenness
of
the
stranger
arrival
might
conceivably
have
startled
the
ignorant
peasant
with
nerves
already
overwrought
from
the
occurrence
of
the
night
was
not
prepared
for
the
violence
of
the
man
terror
as
shown
by
the
immediate
sequel
for
after
several
moments
prayer
and
prostration
with
groans
half
smothered
against
the
very
ground
he
sprang
impetuously
to
his
feet
again
turned
to
his
employer
with
eyes
that
gleamed
wildly
in
that
face
of
chalk
cried
out
the
voice
thick
with
the
confusion
of
his
fear
it
is
the
wind
come
from
the
mountains
come
older
than
the
stones
they
are
save
yourself
hide
your
eyes
fly
and
was
gone
like
a
deer
he
went
he
waited
neither
for
food
nor
payment
but
flung
the
great
black
burka
round
his
face
and
ran
and
to
bereft
of
all
power
of
movement
as
he
watched
in
complete
bewilderment
one
thing
seemed
clear
the
man
went
in
this
extraordinary
fashion
because
he
was
afraid
of
something
he
had
not
seen
for
as
he
ran
with
wild
and
leaping
strides
he
did
not
run
away
from
the
figure
he
took
the
direction
straight
toward
the
spot
where
the
stranger
still
stood
motionless
as
a
tree
so
close
he
passed
him
that
he
must
almost
have
brushed
his
very
shoulder
he
did
not
see
him
the
last
thing
the
irishman
noted
was
that
in
his
violence
the
man
had
dropped
the
yellow
bashlik
from
his
head
saw
him
stoop
with
a
flying
rush
to
pick
it
up
he
seemed
to
catch
it
as
it
fell
and
then
the
big
figure
moved
he
came
slowly
forward
from
among
the
trees
his
hands
outstretched
in
greeting
on
his
great
visage
a
shining
smile
of
welcome
that
seemed
to
share
the
sunrise
in
that
moment
for
the
irishman
all
was
forgotten
as
though
unknown
unseen
save
the
feelings
of
extraordinary
happiness
that
filled
him
to
the
brim
xxx
the
poets
are
thus
liberating
gods
the
ancient
british
bards
had
for
the
title
of
their
order
who
are
free
throughout
the
world
they
are
free
and
they
make
free
an
imaginative
book
renders
us
much
more
service
at
first
by
stimulating
us
through
its
tropes
than
afterward
when
we
arrive
at
the
precise
sense
of
the
author
i
think
nothing
is
of
any
value
in
books
excepting
the
transcendental
and
extraordinary
if
a
man
is
inflamed
and
carried
away
by
his
thought
to
that
degree
that
he
forgets
the
authors
and
the
public
and
heeds
only
this
one
dream
which
holds
him
like
an
insanity
let
me
read
his
paper
and
you
may
have
all
the
arguments
and
histories
and
criticism
emerson
to
criticize
deny
perhaps
to
sneer
is
no
very
difficult
or
uncommon
function
of
the
mind
and
the
story
as
i
first
heard
him
tell
it
lying
there
in
the
grass
beyond
the
serpentine
that
summer
evening
roused
in
me
i
must
confess
all
of
these
very
ordinary
faculties
yet
as
i
listened
to
his
voice
that
mingled
with
the
rustle
of
the
poplars
overhead
and
watched
his
eager
face
and
gestures
it
came
to
me
dimly
that
a
man
mistakes
may
be
due
to
his
attempting
bigger
things
than
his
little
critic
ever
dreamed
perhaps
and
gradually
i
shared
the
vision
that
this
unrhyming
poet
by
my
side
had
somehow
lived
out
in
action
inner
experience
for
him
was
ever
the
reality
not
the
mere
forms
or
deeds
that
clothe
it
in
partial
physical
expression
there
was
no
question
of
course
that
he
had
actually
met
this
big
inarticulate
russian
on
the
steamer
that
stahl
part
in
the
account
was
unvarnished
that
the
boy
had
fallen
on
the
deck
from
heart
disease
and
that
after
an
interval
chance
had
brought
and
the
father
together
again
in
this
valley
of
the
central
caucasus
all
that
was
as
literal
as
the
superstitious
terror
of
the
georgian
peasant
further
that
the
russian
possessed
precisely
those
qualities
of
powerful
sympathy
with
the
other
hidden
longings
which
the
celt
had
been
so
quick
to
appropriate
this
too
was
literal
enough
here
doubtless
was
the
springboard
whence
he
leaped
into
the
stream
of
this
adventure
with
an
eagerness
of
fine
belief
which
must
make
this
dull
world
a
very
wonderful
place
indeed
to
those
who
know
it
for
it
is
the
visioned
faculty
of
correlating
the
commonest
event
with
the
procession
of
august
powers
that
pass
ever
to
and
fro
behind
life
swaying
curtain
and
of
divining
in
the
most
ordinary
of
yellow
buttercups
the
golden
fires
of
a
dropped
star
again
for
terence
there
seemed
no
definite
line
that
marked
off
one
state
of
consciousness
from
another
just
as
there
seems
no
given
instant
when
a
man
passes
actually
from
sleep
to
waking
from
pleasure
to
pain
from
joy
to
grief
there
is
indeed
no
fixed
threshold
between
the
states
of
normal
and
abnormal
consciousness
in
this
stranger
he
imagined
a
sense
of
companionship
that
by
some
magic
of
alchemy
transformed
his
deep
loneliness
into
joy
and
satisfied
his
passionate
yearnings
by
bringing
their
subjective
fulfillment
within
range
to
have
found
acceptance
in
his
sight
was
thus
a
revolutionary
fact
in
his
existence
while
a
part
of
my
mind
may
have
labeled
it
all
as
creative
imagination
another
part
recognized
it
as
plainly
true
because
his
being
lived
it
out
without
the
least
denial
he
at
any
rate
was
not
inventing
nor
ever
knew
an
instant
doubt
he
simply
told
me
what
had
happened
the
discrepancies
the
omissions
in
his
written
account
especially
were
simply
due
i
feel
to
the
fact
that
his
skill
in
words
was
not
equal
to
the
depth
and
brilliance
of
the
emotions
that
he
experienced
but
the
fact
remains
he
did
experience
them
his
fairy
tale
convinced
his
faith
had
made
him
whole
one
with
the
earth
the
sense
of
disunion
between
his
outer
and
his
inner
self
was
gone
and
now
as
these
two
began
their
journey
together
into
the
wilder
region
of
these
stupendous
mountains
says
he
realized
clearly
that
the
change
he
had
dreaded
as
an
inner
catastrophe
simply
would
mean
the
complete
and
final
transfer
of
his
consciousness
from
the
without
to
the
within
it
would
involve
the
loss
only
of
what
constituted
him
a
person
among
the
external
activities
of
the
world
today
he
would
lose
his
life
to
find
it
the
deeper
self
thus
quickened
by
the
stranger
must
finally
assert
its
authority
over
the
rest
to
join
these
urwelt
beings
and
share
their
eternal
life
of
beauty
close
to
the
earth
herself
he
must
shift
the
center
only
thus
could
he
enter
the
state
before
the
fall
that
ancient
garden
of
the
so
close
behind
his
daily
life
and
know
deliverance
from
the
discontent
of
modern
conditions
that
so
distressed
him
to
do
this
temporarily
perhaps
had
long
been
possible
to
him
in
dream
in
reverie
in
those
imaginative
trances
when
he
almost
seemed
to
leave
his
body
altogether
but
to
achieve
it
permanently
was
something
more
than
any
such
passing
disablement
of
the
normal
self
it
involved
he
now
saw
clearly
that
which
he
had
already
witnessed
in
the
boy
the
final
release
of
his
double
in
death
thus
as
they
made
their
way
northwards
nominally
toward
the
mighty
elbruz
and
the
borders
of
swanetia
the
irishman
knew
in
his
heart
that
they
in
reality
came
nearer
to
the
garden
long
desired
and
to
those
lofty
gates
of
horn
and
ivory
that
hitherto
he
had
never
found
because
he
feared
to
let
himself
go
often
he
had
camped
beneath
the
walls
had
smelt
the
flowers
heard
the
songs
and
even
caught
glimpses
of
the
life
that
moved
so
gorgeously
within
but
the
gates
themselves
had
never
shone
for
him
even
against
the
sky
of
dream
because
his
vision
had
been
clouded
by
alarm
they
swung
it
had
seemed
to
him
before
in
only
one
direction
for
those
who
enter
he
had
always
hesitated
lost
his
way
returned
and
many
like
him
make
the
same
mistake
once
in
there
need
be
no
return
for
in
reality
the
walls
spread
outwards
and
enclose
the
entire
world
civilization
and
humanity
the
man
of
smaller
vision
had
called
out
to
him
as
passwords
to
safety
simplicity
and
love
he
now
discovered
were
the
truer
clues
his
big
friend
in
silence
taught
him
now
he
knew
for
in
that
little
hamlet
their
meeting
had
taken
place
in
silence
no
actual
speech
had
passed
you
go
so
the
russian
conveyed
by
a
look
and
by
a
movement
of
his
whole
figure
indicating
the
direction
and
to
the
irishman
assenting
inclination
of
the
head
he
made
an
answering
gesture
that
merely
signified
compliance
with
a
plan
already
known
to
both
we
go
together
then
and
there
and
then
they
started
side
by
side
the
suddenness
of
this
concerted
departure
only
seemed
strange
afterwards
when
looked
back
upon
it
for
at
the
time
it
seemed
as
inevitable
as
being
obliged
to
swim
once
the
dive
is
taken
he
stood
upon
a
pinnacle
whence
lesser
details
were
invisible
he
knew
a
kind
of
exaltation
of
loftier
vision
small
facts
that
ordinarily
might
fill
the
day
with
trouble
sank
below
the
horizon
then
he
did
not
even
notice
that
they
went
without
food
horse
or
blankets
it
was
reckless
unrestrained
and
utterly
unhindered
this
free
together
thus
might
he
have
gone
upon
a
journey
with
the
wind
the
sunshine
or
the
rain
departure
with
a
thought
a
dream
a
fancy
could
not
have
been
less
unhampered
the
only
detail
of
his
outer
world
that
lingered
and
that
already
sinking
out
of
sight
like
a
stone
into
deep
water
was
the
image
of
the
running
peasant
for
a
moment
he
recalled
the
picture
he
saw
the
man
in
the
act
of
stooping
after
the
fallen
bashlik
he
saw
him
seize
it
lift
it
to
his
head
again
but
the
picture
was
small
already
very
far
away
before
the
bashlik
actually
reached
the
head
the
detail
dipped
into
mist
and
vanished
xxxi
it
was
spring
and
the
flutes
of
pan
played
everywhere
the
radiance
of
the
world
first
morning
shone
undimmed
life
flowed
and
sang
and
danced
abundant
and
untamed
it
bathed
the
mountains
and
that
sky
of
stainless
blue
it
bathed
him
too
dipped
washed
and
shining
in
it
he
walked
the
earth
as
she
lay
radiant
in
her
early
youth
the
crystal
presence
of
her
everlasting
spring
flew
laughing
through
a
world
of
light
and
flowers
flowers
that
none
could
ever
pluck
to
die
light
that
could
never
fade
to
darkness
within
walls
and
roofs
all
day
they
wound
easily
as
though
on
winged
feet
through
the
steep
belt
of
box
and
beech
woods
and
in
sparkling
brilliant
heat
across
open
spaces
where
the
azaleas
shone
a
cooling
wind
fresh
as
the
dawn
seemed
ever
to
urge
them
forwards
the
country
for
all
its
huge
scale
and
wildness
was
the
giant
bushy
trees
wore
an
air
of
being
tended
by
the
big
winds
that
ran
with
rustling
music
among
their
waving
foliage
between
the
rhododendrons
were
avenues
of
turf
pathways
yet
older
than
the
moon
from
which
a
thousand
gardeners
of
wind
and
dew
had
gone
but
a
moment
before
to
care
for
others
further
on
over
all
brimmed
up
some
primal
beauty
of
a
simple
life
some
immemorial
soft
glory
of
the
dawn
closer
and
closer
deeper
and
deeper
ever
swifter
ever
more
direct
passed
down
toward
the
heart
of
his
mother
being
along
the
tenderest
pathways
of
his
inner
being
so
wee
so
soft
so
simple
that
for
most
men
they
lie
ignored
or
overgrown
he
slipped
with
joy
a
little
nearer
one
stage
perhaps
toward
reality
pan
blew
in
power
across
these
caucasian
heights
and
valleys
sweet
sweet
sweet
o
pan
piercing
sweet
by
the
river
blinding
sweet
o
great
god
pan
the
sun
on
the
hill
forgot
to
die
and
the
lilies
revived
and
the
came
back
to
dream
on
the
river
in
front
his
big
leader
no
longer
blundering
clumsily
as
on
that
toy
steamer
with
the
awkward
and
lesser
motion
known
to
men
pressed
forward
with
a
kind
of
giant
sure
supremacy
along
paths
he
knew
or
rather
over
a
trackless
pathless
world
which
the
great
planet
had
charted
lovingly
for
his
splendid
feet
that
wind
blowing
from
the
depths
of
valleys
left
long
since
behind
accompanied
them
wisely
they
heard
not
the
faint
horns
of
elfland
faintly
blowing
but
the
blasts
of
the
trumpets
growing
out
of
the
still
distance
nearer
ever
nearer
for
leagues
below
the
beech
woods
poured
over
the
enormous
slopes
in
a
sea
of
soft
green
foam
and
through
the
meadow
spaces
they
saw
the
sweet
nakedness
of
running
water
and
listened
to
its
song
at
noon
they
rested
in
the
greater
heat
sleeping
beneath
the
shadow
of
big
rocks
and
sometimes
traveled
late
into
the
night
when
the
stars
guided
them
and
they
knew
the
pointing
of
the
winds
the
very
moonlight
then
that
washed
this
lonely
world
with
silver
sheeting
the
heights
of
snow
beyond
was
friendly
half
divine
and
it
seemed
to
that
while
they
slept
they
were
watched
and
cared
for
as
though
others
who
awaited
had
already
come
halfway
out
to
meet
them
and
ever
more
and
more
the
passion
of
his
happiness
increased
he
knew
himself
complete
fulfilled
made
whole
it
was
as
though
his
self
were
passing
outwards
into
hundreds
of
thousands
and
becoming
countless
as
the
sand
he
was
everywhere
in
everything
shining
singing
dancing
with
the
ancient
woods
he
breathed
slipped
with
the
streams
down
the
still
darkened
valleys
called
from
each
towering
summit
to
the
sun
and
flew
with
all
the
winds
across
the
immense
untrodden
slopes
about
him
lay
this
whole
spread
being
of
the
flowered
caucasus
huge
and
quiet
drinking
in
the
sunshine
at
its
leisure
but
it
lay
also
himself
for
his
expanding
consciousness
included
and
contained
it
through
it
this
early
potent
mood
of
nature
he
passed
toward
the
soul
of
the
earth
within
even
as
a
child
caught
by
a
mood
of
winning
tenderness
in
its
mother
passes
closer
to
the
heart
that
gave
it
birth
some
central
love
enwrapped
him
he
knew
the
surrounding
power
of
everlasting
arms
xxxii

goal
is
one
with
the
endless
way
from
every

from

drowned

these
are

and
thou

art
they
myers
from
a
cosmic
outlook
the
account
of
what
followed
simply
swept
me
into
fairyland
yet
a
fairyland
that
is
true
because
it
lives
in
every
imaginative
heart
that
does
not
dream
itself
shut
off
from
the
universe
in
some
wee
compartment
all
alone
if
written
account
and
especially
his
tumbled
notebooks
left
me
bewildered
and
confused
the
fragments
that
he
told
me
brought
this
sense
of
an
immense
sweet
picture
that
actually
existed
i
caught
small
scenes
of
it
set
in
some
wild
high
light
their
very
incoherence
conveyed
the
gorgeous
splendor
of
the
whole
better
than
any
neat
ordered
sequence
could
possibly
have
done
climax
in
the
meaning
there
was
none
the
thing
flowed
round
and
round
forever
a
sense
of
something
eternal
wrapped
me
as
i
listened
for
his
imagination
set
the
whole
adventure
out
of
time
and
space
and
i
caught
myself
dreaming
too
a
thousand
years
in
his
sight
i
understood
the
old
words
as
refreshingly
new
might
be
a
day
thus
felt
that
monk
perhaps
for
whose
heart
a
hundred
years
had
passed
while
he
listened
to
the
singing
of
a
little
bird
my
practical
questions
it
was
only
at
the
beginning
that
i
was
dull
enough
to
ask
them
he
did
not
satisfy
because
he
could
not
there
was
never
the
least
suggestion
of
the
artist
mere
invention
you
really
felt
the
earth
about
and
in
you
i
had
asked
much
as
one
feels
the
presence
of
a
friend
and
living
person
drowned
in
her
yes
as
in
the
thoughts
and
atmosphere
of
some
one
awfully
loved
his
voice
a
little
trembled
as
he
said
it
so
speech
unnecessary
impossible
fatal
was
the
laconic
comprehensive
reply
limiting
destructive
even
that
at
least
i
grasped
the
pitifulness
of
words
before
that
love
by
which
self
goes
wholly
lost
in
the
being
of
another
adrift
yet
cared
for
gathered
all
wonderfully
in
and
your
russian
friend
your
leader
i
ventured
haltingly
his
reply
was
curiously
illuminating
like
some
great
guiding
thought
within
her
mind
some
flaming
interpreting
her
love
and
splendor
leading
me
straight
as
you
felt
at
marseilles
a
clue
a
vital
clue
for
i
remembered
the
singular
phrase
he
had
used
in
the
notebook
not
a
bad
word
he
laughed
certainly
as
far
as
it
goes
not
a
wrong
one
for
he
was
at
the
same
time
within
myself
we
merged
as
our
life
grew
and
spread
we
swept
things
along
with
us
from
the
banks
we
were
in
flood
together
he
cried
we
drew
the
landscape
with
us
the
last
words
baffled
me
i
found
no
immediate
response
he
pushed
away
the
plates
on
the
table
before
us
where
we
had
been
lunching
in
the
back
room
of
a
dingy
soho
restaurant
we
now
had
the
place
to
ourselves
he
drew
his
chair
a
little
nearer
do
ye
see
our
journey
also
was
he
added
abruptly
the
pale
london
sunlight
came
through
the
window
across
chimneys
dreary
roofs
courtyards
yet
where
it
touched
his
face
it
seemed
at
once
to
shine
his
voice
was
warm
and
eager
i
caught
from
him
as
it
were
both
heat
and
light
you
moved
actually
though
over
country
while
at
the
same
time
we
moved
within
advanced
sank
deeper
he
returned
call
it
what
you
will
our
condition
moved
there
was
this
correspondence
between
the
two
over
her
face
we
walked
yet
into
her
as
well
we
with
one
greater
than
ourselves
both
caught
and
merged
in
her
in
utter
sympathy
with
one
another
as
with
herself
this
stopped
me
dead
i
could
not
pretend
more
than
a
vague
sympathetic
understanding
with
such
descriptions
of
a
mystical
experience
nor
it
was
clear
did
he
expect
it
of
me
even
his
own
heart
was
troubled
and
he
knew
he
spoke
of
things
that
only
few
may
deal
with
sanely
still
fewer
hear
with
patience
but
oh
that
little
room
in
greek
street
smelt
of
forests
dew
and
dawn
as
he
told
it
that
dear
wayward
child
of
earth
for
his
voice
fell
like
music
that
makes
giddy
the
dim
brain
faint
with
intoxication
of
keen
joy
i
watched
those
delicate
hands
he
spread
about
him
through
the
air
the
tender
sensitive
lips
the
light
blue
eyes
that
glowed
i
noted
the
real
strength
in
the
face
a
sort
of
nobility
it
was
his
shabby
suit
of
grey
his
tie
never
caught
properly
in
the
collar
the
frayed
cuffs
and
the
enormous
boots
he
wore
even
in
london
policeman
boots
as
we
used
to
call
them
with
a
laugh
so
vivid
was
the
picture
that
he
painted
almost
it
seemed
i
knew
myself
the
pulse
of
that
eternal
spring
beneath
our
feet
beating
in
vain
against
the
suffocating
weight
of
london
bricks
and
pavements
laid
by
civilization
the
earth
delight
striving
to
push
outwards
into
visible
form
as
flowers
she
flashed
some
scrap
of
meaning
thus
into
me
though
blunted
on
the
way
i
fear
and
crudely
paraphrased
yes
as
he
talked
across
the
airless
gloom
of
that
little
back
room
in
some
small
way
i
caught
the
splendor
of
his
vision
behind
the
words
i
caught
it
here
and
there
my
own
wee
world
extended
my
being
stretched
to
understand
him
and
to
net
in
fugitive
fragments
the
scenes
of
wonder
that
he
knew
complete
perhaps
his
larger
consciousness
fringed
my
own
to
bruise
it
as
he
claimed
the
earth
had
done
to
him
so
that
i
glimpsed
in
tinier
measure
an
experience
that
in
himself
blazed
whole
and
thundering
it
was
i
must
admit
exalting
and
invigorating
if
a
little
breathless
and
the
return
to
streets
and
omnibuses
painful
a
descent
to
ugliness
and
disappointment
for
things
i
can
hardly
understand
now
even
in
my
own
descriptions
of
them
seemed
at
the
time
quite
clear
or
at
any
rate
whereas
normally
i
could
never
have
compassed
them
at
all
it
taught
me
that
at
least
i
know
in
some
spiritual
way
i
quickened
to
the
view
that
all
great
teaching
really
comes
in
some
such
curious
fashion
via
a
temporary
stretching
or
extension
of
the
heart
to
receive
it
the
little
normal
self
is
pushed
aside
to
make
room
even
to
the
point
of
loss
in
order
to
contain
it
later
the
consciousness
contracts
again
but
it
has
expanded
and
there
has
been
growth
was
this
i
wondered
perhaps
what
mystics
speak
of
when
they
say
the
personal
life
must
slip
aside
be
trampled
on
submerged
before
there
can
be
room
for
the
divine
presences
at
any
rate
as
he
talked
there
over
coffee
that
grew
cold
and
cigarette
smoke
that
made
the
air
yet
thicker
than
it
naturally
was
his
words
conveyed
with
almost
grandeur
of
conviction
this
reality
of
a
profound
inner
experience
i
shared
in
some
faint
way
its
truth
and
beauty
so
that
when
i
saw
it
in
his
written
form
i
marveled
to
find
the
thing
so
thin
and
cold
and
dwindled
the
key
his
personal
presence
supplied
of
guidance
and
interpretation
of
course
was
gone
xxxiii
why
what
is
this
patient
entrance
into
nature
deep
resources
but
the
child
most
gradual
learning
to
walk
upright
without
bane
when
we
drive
out
from
the
cloud
of
steam
majestical
white
horses
are
we
greater
than
the
first
men
who
led
black
ones
by
the
mane
browning
the
russian
led
styled
him
thus
to
the
end
for
want
of
a
larger
word
perhaps
a
word
to
phrase
the
inner
and
the
outer
although
the
mountains
were
devoid
of
trails
he
seemed
always
certain
of
his
way
an
absolute
sense
of
orientation
possessed
him
or
rather
the
whole
earth
became
a
single
pathway
her
being
in
and
about
their
hearts
concealed
no
secrets
he
knew
the
fresh
cool
as
surely
as
the
corners
where
the
wild
honey
gathered
it
seemed
as
natural
that
the
bees
should
leave
them
unmolested
giving
them
freely
of
their
store
as
that
the
savage
dogs
in
the
aouls
or
villages
they
passed
so
rarely
now
should
refrain
from
attack
even
the
peasants
shared
with
them
some
common
splendid
life
occasionally
they
passed
an
ossetian
on
horseback
a
rifle
swung
across
his
saddle
a
covering
burka
draping
his
shoulders
and
the
animal
haunches
in
a
single
form
that
seemed
a
very
outgrowth
of
the
mountains
but
not
even
a
greeting
was
exchanged
they
passed
in
silence
often
very
close
as
though
they
did
not
see
these
two
on
foot
and
once
or
twice
the
horses
reared
and
whinnied
while
their
riders
made
the
signs
of
their
religion
sentries
they
seemed
but
for
the
password
known
to
both
they
would
have
stopped
the
travelers
in
these
forsaken
fastnesses
mere
unprotected
wandering
means
death
yet
to
the
happy
irishman
there
never
came
a
thought
of
danger
or
alarm
all
was
a
portion
of
himself
and
no
man
can
be
afraid
of
his
own
hands
or
feet
their
convoy
was
immense
invisible
a
guaranteed
security
of
the
vast
earth
herself
no
little
personal
injury
could
pass
so
huge
defense
others
armed
with
a
lesser
security
of
knives
and
guns
and
guides
would
assuredly
have
been
turned
back
or
had
they
shown
resistance
would
never
have
been
heard
to
tell
the
tale
stahl
and
the
for
instance
but
such
bothering
little
thoughts
with
their
hard
edges
no
longer
touched
reality
they
spun
away
and
found
no
lodgment
they
were
untrue
false
items
of
some
lesser
world
unrealized
for
in
proportion
as
he
fixed
his
thoughts
successfully
on
outward
and
physical
things
the
world
wherein
he
now
walked
grew
dim
he
missed
the
path
stumbled
saw
trees
and
flowers
indistinctly
failed
to
hear
properly
the
call
of
birds
and
wind
to
feel
the
touch
of
sun
and
most
unwelcome
of
all
was
aware
that
his
leader
left
him
dwindling
in
size
dropping
away
somehow
among
shadows
far
behind
or
far
ahead
the
inversion
was
strangely
complete
what
men
called
solid
real
and
permanent
he
now
knew
as
the
veriest
shadows
of
existence
fleeting
unsatisfactory
false
their
dreary
had
all
his
life
oppressed
him
he
now
knew
why
men
driving
their
forces
outwards
for
external
possessions
had
lost
the
way
so
utterly
it
truly
was
amazing
he
no
longer
quite
understood
how
such
feverish
strife
was
possible
to
intelligent
beings
the
the
tourists
his
london
friends
the
great
majority
of
men
and
women
he
had
known
pain
in
their
hearts
and
weariness
in
their
eyes
the
sad
strained
faces
the
furious
rush
to
catch
a
little
pleasure
they
deemed
joy
it
seemed
like
some
wild
senseless
game
that
madness
plays
he
found
it
difficult
to
endow
them
one
and
all
with
any
sense
of
life
he
saw
them
groping
in
thick
darkness
snatching
with
hands
of
shadow
at
things
of
even
thinner
shadow
all
moving
in
a
wild
and
frantic
circle
of
artificial
desires
while
just
beyond
absurdly
close
to
many
blazed
this
great
living
sunshine
of
reality
and
peace
and
beauty
if
only
they
would
turn
and
look
in
fleeting
moments
these
sordid
glimpses
of
that
dark
and
still
afflicted
his
outer
sight
the
nightmare
he
had
left
behind
it
played
like
some
gloomy
memory
through
a
corner
of
consciousness
not
yet
wholly
disentangled
from
it
already
he
burned
to
share
his
story
with
the
world
a
few
he
saw
who
here
and
there
half
turned
touched
by
a
flashing
ray
then
rushed
away
into
the
old
blackness
as
though
frightened
not
daring
to
escape
false
images
thrown
outward
by
the
intellect
prevented
stahl
he
saw
groping
a
soft
light
of
yearning
in
his
eyes
a
hand
outstretched
to
push
the
shadows
from
him
yet
ever
gathering
them
instead
men
he
saw
by
the
million
youth
still
in
their
hearts
yet
slaving
in
darkened
cages
not
merely
to
earn
a
competency
but
to
pile
more
gold
for
things
not
really
wanted
faces
of
greed
round
the
pandemonium
of
exchanges
even
fair
women
playing
bridge
through
all
a
summer
afternoon
the
strife
and
lust
and
passion
for
possessions
degrading
every
heart
choking
the
channels
of
simplicity
over
the
cities
of
the
world
he
heard
the
demon
civilization
sing
its
song
of
terror
and
desolation
its
music
of
destruction
shook
the
nations
he
saw
the
millions
dance
and
mid
the
bewildering
ugly
thunder
of
that
sound
few
could
catch
the
small
sweet
voice
played
by
the
earth
upon
the
little
pipes
of
pan
the
fluting
call
of
nature
to
the
simple
life
which
is
the
inner
for
now
as
he
moved
closer
to
the
earth
deeper
ever
deeper
into
the
enfolding
moods
of
her
vast
collective
consciousness
he
drew
nearer
to
the
reality
that
satisfies
he
approached
that
center
where
outward
activity
is
less
yet
energy
and
vitality
far
greater
because
it
is
at
rest
here
he
met
things
halfway
as
it
were
for
the
outer
physical
world
where
they
would
appear
later
as
events
but
not
yet
emerged
still
alive
and
breaking
with
their
undischarged
and
natural
potencies
modern
life
he
discerned
dealt
only
with
these
forces
when
they
had
emerged
masquerading
at
the
outer
rim
of
life
as
complete
embodiments
whereas
actually
they
are
but
partial
and
symbolical
expressions
of
their
eternal
prototypes
behind
and
men
today
were
busy
at
this
periphery
only
touch
with
the
center
lost
madly
consumed
with
the
unimportant
details
that
concealed
the
inner
glory
it
was
the
spirit
of
the
age
to
mistake
the
outer
shell
for
the
inner
reality
he
at
last
understood
the
reason
of
his
starved
loneliness
amid
the
stupid
uproar
of
life
why
he
distrusted
civilization
and
stood
apart
his
yearnings
were
explained
his
heart
dwelt
ever
in
the
golden
age
of
the
earth
first
youth
and
at
last
he
was
coming
home
like
mud
settling
in
dirty
water
the
casual
realities
of
that
outer
life
all
sank
away
he
grew
clear
within
one
with
the
primitive
splendor
beauty
grace
of
a
fresh
world
over
his
inner
self
flooding
slowly
the
passages
and
cellars
those
subterranean
ways
that
honeycomb
the
foundations
of
personality
this
tide
of
power
rose
filling
chamber
after
chamber
melting
down
walls
and
ceiling
eating
away
divisions
softly
and
irresistibly
it
climbed
in
silence
merging
all
moods
and
disunion
of
his
separate
selves
into
the
single
thing
that
made
him
comprehensible
to
himself
and
able
to
know
the
earth
as
mother
he
saw
himself
whole
he
knew
himself
divine
a
strange
tumult
as
of
some
ecstasy
of
old
remembrance
invaded
him
he
dropped
back
into
a
more
spacious
scale
of
time
long
long
ago
when
a
month
might
be
a
moment
or
a
thousand
years
pass
round
him
as
a
single
day
the
qualities
of
all
the
earth
lay
too
so
easily
contained
within
himself
he
understood
that
old
legend
by
which
man
the
microcosm
represents
and
sums
up
earth
the
macrocosm
in
himself
so
that
nature
becomes
the
symbol
and
interpreter
of
his
inner
being
the
strength
and
dignity
of
the
trees
he
drew
into
himself
the
power
of
the
wind
was
his
with
his
unwearied
feet
ran
all
the
sweet
and
facile
swiftness
of
the
rivulets
and
in
his
thoughts
the
graciousness
of
flowers
the
wavy
softness
of
the
grass
the
peace
of
open
spaces
and
the
calm
of
that
vast
sky
the
murmur
of
the
was
in
his
blood
and
in
his
heart
the
exaltation
of
her
golden
mood
of
spring
how
then
could
speech
be
possible
since
both
shared
this
common
life
the
communion
with
his
friend
and
leader
was
too
profound
and
perfect
for
any
stammering
utterance
in
the
broken
partial
symbols
known
as
language
this
was
done
for
them
the
singing
of
the
birds
the
the
rippling
of
water
the
very
humming
of
the
myriad
insects
even
and
rustling
of
the
grass
and
leaves
shaped
all
they
felt
in
some
articulate
expression
that
was
right
complete
and
adequate
the
passion
of
the
larks
set
all
the
sky
to
music
and
songs
far
sweeter
than
the
nightingales
made
every
dusk
divine
he
understood
now
that
laborious
utterance
of
his
friend
upon
the
steamer
and
why
his
difficulty
with
words
was
more
than
he
could
overcome
like
a
current
in
the
sea
he
still
preserved
identity
yet
knew
the
freedom
of
a
boundless
being
and
meanwhile
the
tide
was
ever
rising
with
this
singular
companion
he
neared
that
inner
realization
which
should
reveal
them
as
they
were
thoughts
in
the
earth
old
consciousness
too
primitive
too
far
away
too
vital
and
terrific
to
be
confined
in
any
outward
physical
expression
of
the
civilized
world
today
the
earth
shone
glittered
sang
holding
them
close
to
the
rhythm
of
her
gigantic
heart
her
glory
was
their
own
in
the
blazing
summer
of
the
inner
life
they
floated
happy
caught
away
at
peace
emanations
of
her
living
self
the
valleys
far
below
were
filled
with
mist
cutting
them
off
literally
from
the
world
of
men
but
the
beauty
of
the
upper
mountains
grew
more
and
more
bewilderingly
enticing
the
scale
was
so
immense
while
the
brilliant
clearness
of
the
air
brought
distance
close
before
the
eyes
altered
perspective
and
robbed
remote
and
near
of
any
definite
meaning
space
fled
away
it
shifted
here
and
there
at
pleasure
according
as
they
felt
it
was
within
them
not
without
they
passed
dispersed
and
swift
about
the
entire
landscape
a
very
part
of
it
diffused
in
terms
of
light
and
air
and
color
scattered
in
radiance
distributed
through
flowers
spread
through
the
sky
and
grass
and
forests
space
is
a
form
of
thought
but
they
no
longer
thought
they
felt
o
that
prodigious
clean
and
simple
feeling
of
the
earth
love
that
redeems
and
satisfies
power
that
fills
and
blesses
electric
strength
that
kills
the
germ
of
separateness
making
whole
the
medicine
of
the
world
for
days
and
nights
it
was
thus
or
was
it
years
and
minutes
while
they
skirted
the
slopes
and
towers
of
the
huge
and
elbrous
supreme
and
lonely
in
the
heavens
beckoned
solemnly
the
snowy
rolled
past
yet
through
them
kasbek
superbly
thundered
hosts
of
lesser
summits
sang
in
the
dawn
and
whispered
to
the
stars
and
longing
sank
away
impossible
my
boy
my
boy
could
you
only
have
been
with
me
broke
his
voice
across
the
splendid
dream
bringing
me
back
to
the
choking
dingy
room
i
had
forgotten
it
was
like
a
cry
a
cry
of
passionate
yearning
i
with
you
now
i
murmured
some
similar
rising
joy
half
breaking
in
my
breast
that
something
he
sighed
in
answer
something
perhaps
but
i
have
got
it
always
all
still
part
of
me
oh
oh
that
i
could
give
it
to
the
world
and
lift
the
ache
of
all
humanity
his
voice
trembled
i
saw
the
moisture
of
immense
compassion
in
his
eyes
i
felt
myself
swim
out
into
universal
being
perhaps
i
stammered
half
beneath
my
breath
perhaps
some
day
you
may
he
shook
his
head
his
face
turned
very
sad
how
should
they
listen
much
less
understand
their
energies
drive
outwards
and
separation
is
their
god
there
is
no
in
it
xxxiv
oh
whose
heart
is
not
stirred
with
tumultuous
joy
when
the
intimate
life
of
nature
enters
into
his
soul
with
all
its
plenitude
when
that
mighty
sentiment
for
which
language
has
no
other
name
than
love
is
diffused
in
him
like
some
powerful
vapor
when
he
shivering
with
sweet
terror
sinks
into
the
dusky
enticing
bosom
of
nature
when
the
meager
personality
loses
itself
in
the
overpowering
waves
of
passion
and
nothing
remains
but
the
focal
point
of
the
incommensurable
generative
force
an
engulfing
vortex
in
the
ocean
novalis
at
translated
by
early
in
the
afternoon
they
left
the
bigger
trees
behind
and
passed
into
that
more
open
country
where
the
shoulders
of
the
mountains
were
strewn
with
rhododendrons
these
formed
no
continuous
forest
but
stood
about
in
groups
some
feet
high
their
rounded
masses
lighted
on
the
surface
with
fires
of
mauve
and
pink
and
purple
when
the
wind
stirred
them
and
the
rattling
of
their
stiff
leaves
was
heard
it
seemed
as
if
the
skin
of
the
mountains
trembled
to
shake
out
colored
flames
the
air
turned
radiant
through
a
mist
of
running
tints
still
climbing
they
passed
along
broad
glades
of
turfy
grass
between
the
groups
more
rapidly
now
says
went
forward
that
inner
change
of
being
which
accompanied
the
progress
of
their
outer
selves
so
intimate
henceforth
was
this
subtle
correspondence
that
the
very
landscape
took
the
semblance
of
their
feelings
they
moved
as
emanations
of
the
landscape
each
melted
in
the
other
dividing
lines
all
vanished
their
union
with
the
earth
approached
this
strange
and
sweet
fulfillment
and
so
it
was
that
though
at
this
height
the
vestiges
of
bird
and
animal
life
were
wholly
gone
there
grew
more
and
more
strongly
the
sense
that
in
their
further
depths
and
shadows
these
ancient
bushes
screened
activities
even
more
ancient
than
themselves
life
only
concealed
because
they
had
not
reached
its
plane
of
being
pulsed
everywhere
about
their
pathway
immense
in
power
moving
swiftly
very
grand
and
very
simple
and
sometimes
surging
close
seeking
to
draw
them
in
more
than
once
as
they
moved
through
glade
and
clearing
the
irishman
knew
thrills
of
an
intoxicating
happiness
as
this
abundant
driving
life
brushed
past
him
it
came
so
close
it
glided
before
his
eyes
yet
still
was
viewless
it
strode
behind
him
and
before
peered
down
through
space
upon
him
lapped
him
about
with
the
stir
of
mighty
currents
the
deep
suction
of
its
invitation
caught
his
soul
urging
the
change
within
himself
more
quickly
forward
huge
and
delightful
he
describes
it
awful
yet
bringing
no
alarm
he
was
always
on
the
point
of
seeing
surely
the
next
turning
would
reveal
beyond
the
next
dense
tangled
group
would
come
disclosure
behind
that
clustered
mass
of
purple
blossoms
shaking
there
mysteriously
in
the
wind
some
countenance
of
splendor
watched
and
welcomed
before
his
face
passed
swift
deific
figures
tall
erect
compelling
charged
with
this
ancient
golden
life
that
could
never
wholly
pass
away
and
only
just
beyond
the
fringe
of
vision
vision
already
strained
upon
the
edge
his
consciousness
stretched
more
and
more
to
reach
them
while
they
came
crowding
near
to
let
him
know
inclusion
these
projections
of
the
earth
old
consciousness
moved
thick
and
soft
about
them
eternal
in
their
giant
beauty
soon
he
would
know
perhaps
the
very
forms
in
which
she
had
projected
them
dear
portions
of
her

the

half
divined

them
out
a

for

where
still
they
dwelt
and
he
had
loved
and

all
his

with

now

in

than

the
splendor
of
the
closed
about
them
they
drew
nearer
to
the
gates
of
that
old
garden
the
first
time
ever
knew
whose
frontiers
were
not
less
than
the
horizons
of
the
entire
world
for
this
lost
eden
of
a
golden
age
when
first
god
dawned
on
chaos
still
shone
within
the
soul
as
in
those
days
of
innocence
before
the
fall
when
men
first
separated
themselves
from
their
great
mother
a
little
before
sunset
they
halted
a
hundred
yards
above
the
rhododendron
forest
in
a
clear
wide
space
of
turf
that
ran
for
leagues
among
grey
boulders
to
the
lips
of
the
eternal
snowfields
they
waited
through
a
gap
of
sky
with
others
but
slightly
lower
than
himself
the
pyramid
of
kasbek
grim
and
towering
stared
down
upon
them
dreadfully
close
though
really
miles
away
at
their
feet
yawned
the
profound
valley
they
had
climbed
halfway
into
it
unable
to
reach
the
depths
the
sun

dropped
shafts
like
rivers
slanting
already
in

troops
the
shadows
crept
downwards
from
the
summits
overhead
out
of
these
very
shadows
night
drew
swiftly
down
about
the
world
building
with
her
masses
of
silvery
architecture
a
barrier
that
rose
to
heaven
these
two
lay
down
beside
it
beyond
it
spread
that
shining
garden
only
the
between
with
the
rising
of
the
moon
this
barrier
softened
marvelously
letting
the
starbeams
in
it
trembled
like
a
line
of
wavering
music
in
the
wind
of
night
it
settled
downwards
shaking
a
little
toward
the
ground
while
just
above
them
came
a
curving
inwards
like
a
bay
of
darkness
with
overhead
two
stately
towers
their
outline
fringed
with
stars
the
gateway
whispered
something
through
the
mountains
it
may
have
been
the

voice
it
may
have
been
the

it
may
have

shadows

he
followed
his
leader
higher
just
beneath
this
semblance
of
an
portal
which
time
could
neither
fashion
nor
destroy
they
lay
upon
the
earth
and
waited
beside
them
shone
the
world
dressed
by
the
moon
in
silver
the
wind
stood
still
to
watch
the
peak
of
kasbek
from
his
cloudy
distance
listened
too
for
floating
upwards
across
the
spaces
came
a
sound
of
simple
piping
the
fluting
music
of
a
little
reed
it
drew
near
stopped
for
a
moment
as
though
the
player
watched
them
then
with
a
plunging
swiftness
passed
off
through
starry
distance
up
among
the
darker
mountains
the
lost
forsaken

covered
them
nowhere
were
they
extraneous
to
it
they
slept
and
while
they
slept
they
moved
across
the
frontiers
of
fulfillment
the

open

watson
ode
in
may
very
slowly
the
dawn
came
the
sky
blushed
rose
trembled
flamed
a
breath
of
wind
stirred
the
vapors
that
far
below
sheeted
the
surface
of
the
black
sea
but
it
was
still
in
that
gentle
twilight
before
the
actual
color
comes
that
found
he
was
lying
with
his
eyes
wide
open
watching
the
rhododendrons
he
may
have
slept
meanwhile
though
sleep
he
says
involving
loss
of
consciousness
seemed
no
right
description
a
sense
of
interval
there
was
at
any
rate
a
whatever
that
may
mean
he
phrased
it
in
the
writing
and
watching
the
rhododendron
forest
a
hundred
yards
below
he
saw
it
move
through
the
dim
light
this
movement
passed
and
ran
here
there
and
everywhere
a
curious
soft
sound
accompanied
it
that
made
him
remember
the
bible
phrase
of
wind
going
in
the
tops
of
the
mulberry
trees
hushed
swift
elusive
murmur
it
passed
about
him
through
the
dusk
he
caught
it
next
behind
him
and
turning
noticed
groups
upon
the
slopes
groups
that
he
had
not
seen
the
night
before
these
groups
seemed
also
now
to
move
the
isolated
scattered
clusters
came
together
merged
ran
to
the
parent
forest
below
or
melted
just
beyond
the
line
of
vision
above
the
wind
sprang
up
and
rattled
all
the
million
leaves
that
rattling
filled
the
air
and
with
it
came
another
deeper
sound
like
to
a
sound
of
tramping
that
seemed
to
shake
the
earth
confusion
caught
him
then
completely
for
it
was
as
if
the
awoke
rose
up
and
shook
itself
into
a
wild
and
multitudinous
wave
of
life
at
first
he
thought
the
wind
had
somehow
torn
the
rhododendrons
loose
from
their
roots
and
was
strewing
them
with
that
tramping
sound
about
the
slopes
but
the
groups
passed
too
swiftly
over
the
turf
for
that
swept
completely
from
their
fastenings
while
the
tramping
grew
to
a
roaring
as
of
cries
and
voices
that
roaring
had
the
quality
of
the
voice
that
reached
him
weeks
ago
across
the
ægean
sea
a
strange
keen
odor
too
that
was
not
wholly
unfamiliar
moved
upon
the
wind
and
then
he
knew
that
what
he
had
been
watching
all
along
were
not
rhododendrons
at
all
but
living
splendid
creatures
a
host
of
others
moreover
large
ones
and
small
together
stood
shadowy
in
the
background
stamping
their
feet
upon
the
turf
manes
tossing
in
the
early
wind
in
their
entire
mass
awful
as
in
their
individual
outline
somehow
noble
the
light
spread
upwards
from
the
east
with
a
fire
of
terrible
joy
and
wonder
in
his
heart
held
his
breath
and
stared
the
luster
of
their
glorious
bodies
golden
bronze
in
the
sunlight
dazed
the
sight
he
saw
the
splendor
of
ten
hundred
velvet
flanks
in
movement
with
here
and
there
the
uprising
whiteness
of
a
female
outline
that
flashed
and
broke
above
the
general
mass
like
foam
upon
a
great
wave
crest
figures
of
incomparable
grace
and
power
the
sovereign
upright
carriage
the
rippling
muscles
upon
massive
limbs
and
shoulders
that
held
defiant
strength
and
softness
in
exquisite
combination
and
then
he
heard
huge
murmurs
of
their
voices
that
filled
the
dawn
aged
by
lost
thousand
years
and
sonorous
as
the
booming
of
the
sea
a
cry
that
was
like
singing
escaped
him
he
saw
them
rise
and
sweep
away
there
was
a
rush
of
magnificence
they
cantered
wonderfully
they
were
gone
the
roar
of
their
curious
commotion
traveled
over
the
mountains
dying
into
distance
very
swiftly
the
rhododendron
forest
that
had
concealed
their
approach
resumed
its
normal
aspect
but
burning
now
with
colors
innumerable
as
the
sunrise
caught
its
thousand
blossoms
and
understood
that
during
sleep
he
had
passed
with
his
companion
through
the
gates
of
ivory
and
horn
and
stood
now
within
the
first
garden
of
the
early
world
all
frontiers
crossed
all
barriers
behind
he
stood
within
the
paradise
of
his
heart
desire
the
consciousness
of
the
earth
included
him
these
were
early
forms
of
life
she
had
projected
some
of
the
living
prototypes
of
legend
myth
and
fable
embodiments
of
her
first
manifestations
of
consciousness
and
eternal
accessible
to
every
heart
that
holds
a
true
and
passionate
worship
all
his
life
this
love
of
nature
which
was
worship
had
been
his
it
now
fulfilled
itself
merged
by
love
into
the
consciousness
of
the
being
loved
he
her
thoughts
her
powers
and
manifestations
of
life
as
his
own
in
a
flash
of
course
this
all
passed
clearly
before
him
but
there
was
no
time
to
dwell
upon
it
for
the
activity
of
his
companion
had
likewise
become
suddenly
tremendous
he
had
risen
into
complete
revelation
at
last
his
own
had
called
him
he
was
off
to
join
his
kind
the
transformation
came
upon
both
of
them
it
seems
at
once
but
in
that
moment
of
bewilderment
the
irishman
only
realized
it
first
in
his
leader
for
on
the
edge
of
the
advancing
sunlight
first
this
cosmic
being
crouched
then
rose
with
alert
and
springing
movement
leaping
to
his
feet
in
a
single
bound
that
propelled
him
with
a
stride
of
more
than
a
man
two
limbs
his
great
sides
quivered
as
he
shook
himself
a
roar
similar
to
that
sound
the
distance
already
swallowed
rolled
forth
into
the
air
with
head
thrown
back
chest
forward
too
for
all
the
backward
slant
of
the
mighty
shoulders
he
stood
there
grandly
outlined
pushing
the
wind
before
him
the
great
brown
eyes
shone
with
the
joy
of
freedom
and
escape
a
superb
and
regal
transformation
urged
by
the
audacity
of
his
strange
excitement
the
irishman
obeyed
an
impulse
that
came
he
knew
not
whence
the
single
word
sprang
to
his
lips
before
he
could
guess
its
meaning
much
less
hold
it
back
lapithae
he
cried
aloud
lapithae
the
stalwart
figure
turned
with
an
awful
spring
as
though
it
would
trample
him
to
the
ground
a
moment
the
brown
eyes
flamed
with
a
light
of
battle
then
with
another
roar
and
a
gesture
that
was
somehow
both
huge
and
simple
he
seemed
to
rise
and
paw
the
air
the
next
second
this
figure
of
the
come
once
more
into
its
own
bent
down
and
forward
leaped
wonderfully
then
cantering
raced
away
across
the
slopes
to
join
his
kind
he
went
like
a
shape
of
wind
and
cloud
the
heritage
of
racial
memory
was
his
and
certain
words
remained
still
vividly
evocative
that
old
battle
with
the
lapithae
was
but
one
item
of
the
scenes
of
ancient
splendor
lying
in
his
mighty
consciousness
the
instant
he
had
called
the
irishman
himself
lay
caught
in
lost
memory
tumultuous
whirl
the
lonely
world
about
him
seemed
of
a
sudden
magnificently
peopled
sky
woods
and
torrents
he
watched
a
moment
the
fierce
rapidity
with
which
he
sped
toward
the
mountains
the
sound
of
his
feet
already
merged
in
that
other
vaster
tramping
and
then
he
turned
to
watch
himself
for
a
similar
transformation
was
going
forward
in
himself
and
with
the
happiness
of
wild
amazement
he
saw
it
already
indeed
it
was
accomplished
all
white
and
shining
lay
the
sunlight
over
his
own
extended
form
power
was
in
his
limbs
he
rose
above
the
ground
in
some
new
way
the
usual
little
stream
of
breath
became
a
river
of
rushing
air
he
drew
into
stronger
more
capacious
lungs
likewise
his
bust
grew
strangely
deepened
pushed
the
wind
before
it
and
the
sunshine
glowed
on
shaggy
flanks
agleam
with
dew
that
powerfully
drove
the
ground
behind
him
while
he
ran
he
ran
yet
only
partly
as
a
man
runs
he
found
himself
shot
forwards
through
the
air
upright
yet
at
the
same
time
upon
all
fours
brandishing
his
arms
he
flew
with
a
free
unfettered
motion
traversing
the
surface
of
the
mother
mind
and
body
free
of
the
entire
earth
he
was
and
as
he
raced
to
join
the
others
there
passed
again
across
his
memory
faintly
it
was
like
the
little
memory
of
some
physical
pain
almost
the
picture
of
the
boy
who
swam
so
strangely
in
the
sea
the
picture
of
the
parent
curious
emanations
on
the
deck
and
lastly
of
those
flying
shapes
of
cloud
and
wind
his
inner
vision
brought
so
often
speeding
over
long
bare
hills
this
was
the
final
fragment
of
the
outer
world
that
reached
him
he
tore
along
the
mountains
in
the
dawn
the
awful
speed
at
last
explained
his
going
made
a
sound
upon
the
wind
and
like
the
wind
he
raced
far
beyond
him
in
the
distance
he
saw
the
shadow
of
that
disappearing
host
spreading
upon
the
valleys
like
a
mist
faintly
still
he
caught
their
sound
of
roaring
but
it
was
his
own
feet
now
that
made
that
trampling
as
of
hoofs
upon
the
turf
the
landscape
moved
and
opened
gathering
him
in
and
hardly
had
he
gone
when
there
stole
upon
the
place
where
he
had
stood
a
sweet
and
simple
sound
of
music
the
little
piping
of
a
reed
it
dropped
down
through
the
air
perhaps
or
came
from
the
forest
edge
or
possibly
the
sunrise
brought
it
this
ancient
little
sound
of
fluting
on
those
pipes
men
call
the
pipes
of
pan
xxxvi
here
we
but
peak
and
dwindle
the
clank
of
chain
and
crane
the
whirr
of
crank
and
spindle
bewilder
heart
and
brain
the
ends
of
our
endeavor
are
wealth
and
fame
yet
in
the
still
forever
we
one
and
all
the
same
yet
beautiful
and
spacious
the
wise
old
world
appears
yet
frank
and
fair
and
gracious
outlaugh
the
jocund
years
our
arguments
disputing
the
universal
pan
still
wanders
fluting
fluting
fluting
to
maid
and
man
our
weary
his
music
can
not
still
come
let
us
go
and
pipe
with
him
our
fill
henley
in
a
detailed
description
radiant
with
a
wild
loveliness
of
some
forgotten
beauty
and
of
necessity
often
incoherent
the
irishman
conveyed
to
me
sitting
in
that
dreary
soho
restaurant
the
passion
of
his
vision
with
an
astonishing
vitality
and
a
wealth
of
deep
conviction
it
all
poured
from
his
lips
there
was
no
halting
and
no
hesitation
like
a
man
in
trance
he
talked
and
like
a
man
in
trance
he
lived
it
over
again
while
imparting
it
to
me
none
came
to
disturb
us
in
our
dingy
corner
indeed
there
is
no
quieter
place
in
all
london
town
than
the
back
room
of
these
of
the
french
quarter
between
the
hours
of
lunch
and
dinner
the
waiters
vanish
the
patron
disappears
no
customers
come
in
but
i
know
surely
that
its
burning
splendor
came
not
from
the
actual
words
he
used
but
was
due
to
definite
complete
transference
of
the
vision
itself
into
my
own
heart
i
caught
the
fire
from
his
very
thought
his
heat
inflamed
my
mind
words
both
in
the
uttered
and
the
written
version
dimmed
it
all
distressingly
and
the
completeness
of
the
transference
is
proved
for
me
by
the
fact
that
i
never
once
had
need
to
ask
a
question
i
saw
and
understood
it
all
as
he
did
and
hours
must
have
passed
during
the
strange
recital
for
toward
the
close
people
came
in
and
took
the
vacant
tables
the
lights
were
up
and
grimy
waiters
clattered
noisily
about
with
plates
and
knives
and
forks
thrusting
an
inky
carte
du
jour
beneath
our
very
faces
yet
how
to
set
it
down
i
swear
i
know
not
nor
he
indeed
the
notebooks
that
i
found
in
that
old
sack
of
willesden
canvas
were
a
disgrace
to
any
man
who
bid
for
sanity
a
disgrace
to
paper
and
pencil
too
all
memory
of
his
former
life
it
seems
at
first
had
fallen
utterly
away
nothing
survived
to
remind
him
of
it
and
thus
he
lost
all
standard
of
comparison
the
state
he
moved
in
was
too
complete
to
admit
of
standards
or
of
critical
judgment
for
these
confine
imprison
and
belittle
whereas
he
was
free
his
escape
was
unconditioned
from
the
thirty
years
of
his
previous
living
no
single
fragment
broke
through
the
absorption
was
absolute
i
really
do
believe
and
know
myself
he
said
to
me
across
that
spotted
that
for
the
time
i
was
merged
into
the
being
of
another
a
being
immensely
greater
than
myself
perhaps
old
stahl
was
right
perhaps
old
crazy
fechner
and
it
actually
was
the
consciousness
of
the
earth
i
can
only
tell
you
that
the
whole
experience
left
no
room
in
me
for
other
memories
all
i
had
previously
known
was
gone
wiped
clean
away
yet
much
of
what
came
in
its
place
is
beyond
me
to
describe
and
for
a
curious
reason
it
not
the
size
or
splendor
that
prevent
the
telling
but
rather
the
sublime
simplicity
of
it
all
i
know
no
language
today
simple
enough
to
utter
it
far
behind
words
it
lies
as
difficult
of
full
recovery
as
the
dreams
of
deep
sleep
as
the
ecstasy
of
the
religious
elusive
as
the
mystery
of
kubla
khan
or
the
patmos
visions
of
john
full
recapture
i
am
convinced
is
not
possible
at
all
in
words
and
at
the
time
it
did
not
seem
like
vision
it
was
so
natural
unstudied
unprepared
and
ever
there
spontaneous
too
and
artless
as
a
drop
of
water
or
a
baby
toy
the
natural
is
ever
the
unchanging
my
god
i
tell
you
man
it
was
divine
he
made
about
him
a
vehement
sweeping
gesture
with
his
arm
which
emphasized
more
poignantly
than
speech
the
contrast
he
felt
here
where
we
sat
tight
confining
walls
small
stifling
windows
chairs
to
rest
the
body
smothering
roof
and
curtains
doors
of
narrow
entrance
and
exit
floors
to
lift
above
the
sweet
surface
of
the
soil
all
of
them
artificial
barriers
to
shut
out
light
and
separate
away
from
the
earth
see
what
we
come
to
it
said
plainly
and
it
included
even
his
clothes
and
boots
and
collar
the
ridiculous
hat
upon
the
peg
the
unsightly
brolly
in
the
dingy
corner
had
there
been
room
in
me
for
laughter
i
could
well
have
laughed
aloud
for
as
he
raced
across
that
stretch
of
splendid
mountainous
earth
watching
the
sunrise
kiss
the
valleys
and
the
woods
shaking
the
dew
from
his
feet
and
swallowing
the
very
wind
for
breath
he
realized
that
other
forms
of
life
similar
to
his
own
were
everywhere
about
him
also
moving
they
were
a
part
of
the
earth
even
as
i
was
here
she
was
crammed
to
the
brim
with
them
projections
of
her
actual
self
and
being
crowded
with
this
incomparable
ancient
beauty
that
was
strong
as
her
hills
swift
as
her
running
streams
radiant
as
her
wild
flowers
whether
to
call
them
forms
or
thoughts
or
feelings
or
powers
perhaps
i
swear
old
man
i
know
not
her
consciousness
through
which
i
sped
drowned
lost
and
happy
wrapped
us
all
in
together
as
a
mood
contains
its
own
thoughts
and
feelings
for
she
a
being
of
sorts
and
i
in
her
mind
mood
consciousness
call
it
what
you
best
can
these
other
thoughts
and
presences
i
felt
were
the
raw
material
of
forms
perhaps
forces
that
when
they
reach
the
minds
of
men
must
clothe
themselves
in
form
in
order
to
be
known
whether
they
be
dreams
or
gods
or
any
other
kind
of
inspiration
closer
than
that
i
can
not
get
i
knew
myself
within
her
being
like
a
child
and
i
felt
the
deep
eternal
pull
to
simple
things
and
thus
the
beauty
of
the
early
world
companioned
him
and
all
the
forgotten
gods
moved
forward
into
life
they
hovered
everywhere
immense
and
stately
the
rocks
and
trees
and
peaks
that
half
concealed
them
betrayed
at
the
same
time
great
hints
of
their
mighty
gestures
near
him
they
were
he
moved
toward
their
region
if
definite
sight
refused
to
focus
on
them
the
fault
was
not
their
own
but
his
he
never
doubted
that
they
could
be
seen
yet
even
thus
partially
they
manifested
terrifically
he
was
aware
of
their
overshadowing
presences
sight
after
all
was
an
incomplete
form
of
knowing
a
thing
he
had
left
behind
elsewhere
it
belonged
with
the
other
limited
to
some
attenuated
dream
now
all
forgotten
now
he
knew
he
himself
was
of
them
i
am
home
it
seems
he
cried
as
he
ran
cantering
across
the
sunny
slopes
at
last
i
have
found
you
home
and
the
stones
shot
wildly
from
his
thundering
tread
a
roar
of
windy
power
filled
the
sky
and
far
away
that
echoing
tramping
paused
to
listen
we
have
called
you
come
and
the
forms
moved
down
slowly
from
their
mountainous
pedestals
the
woods
breathed
out
a
sigh
the
running
water
sang
the
slopes
all
murmured
through
their
grass
and
flowers
for
a
worshipper
strayed
from
the
outer
world
of
the
dead
stood
within
the
precincts
of
their
ancient
temple
he
had
passed
the
angel
with
the
flaming
sword
those
very
dead
had
set
there
long
ago
the
garden
now
enclosed
him
he
had
found
the
heart
of
the
earth
his
mother
in
the
perfect
union
with
nature
was
fulfilled
he
knew
the
great
the
quiet
of
the
dawn
still
lay
upon
the
world
dew
sparkled
the
air
was
keen
and
fresh
yet
in
spite
of
all
this
vast
sense
of
energy
this
vigor
and
delight
no
longer
felt
the
least
goading
of
excitement
there
was
this
animation
and
this
fine
delight
but
craving
for
sensation
of
any
kind
was
gone
excitement
as
it
tortured
men
in
that
outer
world
he
had
left
could
not
exist
in
this
larger
state
of
being
for
excitement
is
the
appetite
for
something
not
possessed
magnified
artificially
till
it
has
become
a
condition
of
disease
all
that
he
needed
was
now
contained
within
himself
he
was
and
literally
that
unrest
which
men
miscall
delight
could
touch
him
not
nor
torture
him
again
if
this
were
death
how
exquisite
and
time
was
not
a
passing
thing
for
it
lay
he
says
somehow
in
an
ocean
everywhere
heaped
up
in
gulfs
and
spaces
it
was
as
though
he
could
help
himself
and
take
it
that
morning
had
he
so
wished
could
last
forever
he
could
go
backwards
and
taste
the
shadows
of
the
night
again
or
forward
and
bask
in
the
glory
of
hot
noon
there
were
no
parts
of
things
and
so
no
restlessness
no
sense
of
incompleteness
no
divisions
this
quiet
of
the
dawn
lay
in
himself
and
since
he
loved
it
lay
there
cool
and
sweet
and
sparkling
for
years
almost
forever
moreover
while
this
giant
form
of
his
inner
self
had
assumed
was
new
it
yet
seemed
somehow
familiar
the
speed
and
weight
and
power
caused
him
no
distress
there
was
no
detail
that
he
could
not
manage
easily
to
race
thus
the
world
keeping
pace
with
an
eternal
dawn
was
as
simple
as
for
the
earth
herself
to
spin
through
space
his
union
with
her
was
as
complete
as
that
in
every
item
of
her
being
lay
the
wonder
of
her
perfect
form
a
sphere
it
was
complete
nothing
could
add
to
it
yet
while
all
recollection
of
his
former
pettier
self
was
gone
he
began
presently
to
remember
men
though
never
in
relation
to
himself
he
retained
dimly
a
picture
of
that
outer
world
of
strife
and
terror
as
a
memory
of
illness
he
recalled
it
dreadfully
a
nightmare
fever
from
which
he
had
recovered
its
horror
already
fading
out
cities
and
crowds
poverty
illness
pain
and
all
the
various
terror
of
civilization
robbed
of
the
power
to
afflict
yet
still
hung
hovering
about
the
surface
of
his
consciousness
though
powerless
to
break
his
peace
for
the
power
to
understand
it
vanished
no
part
of
him
knew
sympathy
with
it
so
clearly
he
now
saw
himself
sharing
the
earth
that
a
vague
wonder
filled
him
when
he
recalled
the
mad
desires
of
men
to
possess
external
forms
of
things
it
was
amazing
and
perplexing
how
could
they
ever
have
devised
such
wild
and
childish
efforts
all
in
the
wrong
direction
if
that
outer
life
were
the
real
one
how
could
any
intelligent
being
think
it
worth
while
to
live
how
could
any
thinking
man
hold
up
his
head
and
walk
along
the
street
with
dignity
if
that
was
what
he
believed
was
a
man
satisfied
with
it
worth
keeping
alive
at
all
what
bigger
scheme
could
ever
use
him
the
direction
of
modern
life
today
was
diametrically
away
from
happiness
and
truth
peace
was
the
word
he
knew
peace
and
a
singing
joy
he
played
with
the
earth
great
dawn
and
raced
along
these
mountains
through
her
mind
course
the
hills
could
dance
and
sing
and
clap
their
hands
he
saw
it
clear
how
could
it
be
otherwise
they
were
expressions
of
her
giant
moods
what
in
himself
were
thoughts
phases
of
her
ample
surging
consciousness
he
passed
with
the
sunlight
down
the
laughing
valleys
spread
with
the
morning
wind
above
the
woods
shone
on
the
snowy
peaks
and
leaped
with
rushing
laughter
among
the
crystal
streams
these
were
his
swift
and
darting
signs
of
joy
words
of
his
singing
as
it
were
his
main
and
central
being
swung
with
the
pulse
of
the
earth
too
great
for
any
telling
he
read
the
book
of
nature
all
about
him
yes
but
read
it
singing
he
understood
how
this
patient
mother
hungered
for
her
myriad
lost
children
how
in
the
passion
of
her
summers
she
longed
to
bless
them
to
wake
their
high
yearnings
with
the
sweetness
of
her
springs
and
to
whisper
through
her
autumns
how
she
prayed
for
their
return
instinctively
he
read
the
giant
page
before
him
for
every
form
in
nature
is
a
symbol
of
an
idea
and
represents
a
sign
or
letter
a
succession
of
such
symbols
forms
a
language
and
he
who
is
a
true
child
of
nature
may
understand
this
language
and
know
the
character
of
everything
his
mind
becomes
a
mirror
wherein
the
attributes
of
natural
things
are
reflected
and
enter
the
field
of
his
consciousness
for
man
himself
is
but
a
thought
pervading
the
ocean
of
mind
whether
or
not
lie
remembered
these
stammering
yet
pregnant
words
from
the
outer
world
now
left
behind
the
truth
they
shadowed
forth
rose
up
and
took
him
and
so
he
flowed
across
the
mountains
like
a
thing
of
wind
and
cloud
and
so
at
length
came
up
with
the
stragglers
of
that
mighty
herd
of
life
he
joined
them
in
a
of
those
ancient
valleys
they
welcomed
him
and
took
him
to
themselves
for
the
particular
stratum
as
it
were
of
the
earth
enormous
collective
consciousness
to
which
he
belonged
or
rather
that
part
and
corner
in
which
he
was
first
at
home
lay
with
these
lesser
ancient
forms
although
aware
of
far
mightier
expressions
of
her
life
he
could
not
yet
readily
perceive
or
join
them
and
this
was
easily
comprehensible
by
the
analogy
of
his
own
smaller
consciousness
did
not
his
own
mind
hold
thoughts
of
various
kinds
that
could
not
readily
mingle
his
thoughts
of
play
and
frolic
for
instance
could
not
combine
with
the
august
and
graver
sentiments
of
awe
and
worship
though
both
could
dwell
together
in
the
same
heart
and
here
apparently
as
yet
he
only
touched
that
frolicsome
fringe
of
consciousness
that
knew
these
wild
and
playful
lesser
forms
thus
while
he
was
aware
of
other
more
powerful
figures
of
wonder
all
about
him
he
never
quite
achieved
their
full
recognition
the
ordered
deeper
strata
of
her
consciousness
to
which
they
belonged
still
lay
beyond
him
yet
everywhere
he
fringed
them
they
haunted
the
entire
world
they
brooded
hugely
with
a
kind
of
deep
magnificence
that
was
like
the
slow
brooding
of
the
seasons
they
rose
looming
and
splendid
through
the
air
and
sky
proud
strong
and
tragic
for
standing
aloof
from
all
the
rest
in
isolation
like
dreams
in
a
poet
mind
too
potent
for
expression
they
thus
knew
tragedy
the
tragedy
of
long
neglect
and
loneliness
seated
on
peak
and
ridge
rising
beyond
the
summits
in
the
clouds
filling
the
valleys
spread
over
watercourse
and
forest
they
passed
their
life
of
lonely
majesty
apart
their
splendor
too
remote
for
him
as
yet
to
share
long
since
had
earth
withdrawn
them
from
the
hearts
of
men
her
lesser
children
knew
them
no
more
but
still
through
the
deep
recesses
of
her
further
consciousness
they
thundered
and
were
glad
though
few
might
hear
that
thunder
share
that
awful
joy
even
the
irishman
who
in
ordinary
life
had
felt
instinctively
that
worship
which
is
close
to
love
and
so
to
the
union
that
love
brings
even
he
in
this
freedom
only
partially
discerned
their
presences
he
felt
them
now
these
stately
powers
men
once
called
the
gods
but
felt
them
from
a
distance
and
from
a
distance
too
they
saw
and
watched
him
come
he
knew
their
gorgeous
forms
half
dimmed
by
a
remote
and
veiled
enchantment
knew
that
they
reared
aloft
like
ancient
towers
ruined
by
neglect
and
ignorance
starved
and
lonely
but
still
hauntingly
splendid
and
engaging
still
terrifically
alive
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
sometimes
their
awful
eyes
flashed
with
the
sunshine
over
slope
and
valley
and
that
wherever
they
rested
flowers
sprang
to
life
their
nearness
sometimes
swept
him
like
a
storm
and
then
the
entire
herd
with
which
he
mingled
would
stand
abruptly
still
caught
by
a
wave
of
awe
and
wonder
the
host
of
them
stood
still
upon
the
grass
their
frolic
held
a
moment
their
voices
hushed
only
deep
panting
audible
and
the
soft
shuffling
of
their
hoofs
among
the
flowers
they
bowed
their
splendid
heads
and
waited
while
a
god
went
past
them
and
through
himself
as
witness
of
the
passage
a
soft
majestic
power
also
swept
with
the
lift
of
a
hurricane
yet
with
the
gentleness
of
dew
he
felt
the
noblest
in
himself
irresistibly
evoked
it
was
gone
again
as
soon
as
come
it
passed
but
it
left
him
charged
with
a
regal
confidence
and
joy
as
in
the
mountains
a
shower
of
snow
picks
out
the
highest
peaks
in
white
tracing
its
course
and
pattern
over
the
entire
range
so
in
himself
he
knew
the
highest
powers
aspirations
yearnings
hopes
raised
into
shining
white
activity
and
by
these
quickened
splendors
of
his
soul
could
recognize
the
nature
of
the
god
who
came
so
close
and
keeping
mostly
to
the
they
splashed
in
the
torrents
played
and
leaped
and
cantered
from
the
openings
of
many
a
moist
cave
others
came
to
join
them
below
a
certain
level
though
they
never
went
the
forests
knew
them
not
they
loved
the
open
windy
heights
they
turned
and
circulated
as
by
a
common
consent
wheeling
suddenly
together
as
if
a
single
desire
actuated
the
entire
mass
one
instinct
spread
as
it
were
among
the
lot
shared
instantly
conveying
to
each
at
once
the
general
impulse
their
movements
in
this
were
like
those
of
birds
whose
flight
in
coveys
obeys
the
order
of
a
collective
consciousness
of
which
each
single
one
is
an
item
expressions
of
one
single
behind
distributed
through
all
and
without
questioning
or
hesitation
obeyed
while
yet
he
was
free
to
do
as
he
wished
alone
to
do
as
they
did
was
the
greatest
pleasure
that
was
all
for
sometimes
with
two
of
them
one
the
other
of
lesser
mold
he
flew
on
little
journeys
of
his
own
these
two
seemed
nearer
to
him
than
the
rest
he
felt
he
knew
them
and
had
been
with
them
before
their
big
brown
eyes
continually
sought
his
own
with
pleasure
it
almost
seemed
as
if
they
had
all
three
been
separated
long
away
from
one
another
and
had
at
last
returned
no
definite
memory
of
the
interval
came
back
however
the
sea
the
steamer
and
the
incidents
all
had
faded
part
of
that
world
of
lesser
insignificant
dream
where
they
had
happened
but
these
two
kept
close
to
him
they
ran
and
danced
together
the
time
that
passed
included
many
dawns
and
nights
and
also
many
noons
of
splendor
it
all
seemed
endless
perfect
and
serene
that
anything
could
finish
here
did
not
once
occur
to
him
complete
things
can
not
finish
he
passed
through
seas
and
gulfs
of
glorious
existence
for
the
strange
thing
was
that
while
he
only
remembered
afterwards
the
motion
play
and
laughter
he
yet
had
these
other
glimpses
here
and
there
of
some
ordered
and
progressive
life
existing
just
beyond
it
lay
hidden
deeper
within
he
skimmed
its
surface
but
something
prevented
his
knowing
it
fully
and
the
limitation
that
held
him
back
belonged
it
seemed
to
that
thin
world
of
trivial
dreaming
he
had
left
behind
he
had
not
shaken
it
off
entirely
it
still
obscured
his
sight
the
scale
and
manner
of
this
greater
life
faintly
reached
him
nothing
more
it
may
be
that
he
only
failed
to
bring
back
recollection
or
it
may
be
that
he
did
not
penetrate
deeply
enough
to
know
at
any
rate
he
recognized
that
this
sudden
occasional
passing
by
of
vast
deific
figures
had
to
do
with
it
and
that
all
this
ocean
of
earth
deeper
consciousness
was
peopled
with
forms
of
life
that
obeyed
some
splendid
system
of
progressive
ordered
existence
to
be
gathered
up
in
this
one
greater
consciousness
was
not
the
end
rather
was
it
merely
the
beginning
meantime
he
learned
that
here
among
these
lesser
thoughts
of
the
great
mother
all
the
pantheons
of
the
world
had
first
their
origin
the
greek
the
eastern
and
the
northern
too
here
all
the
gods
that
men
have
ever
half
divined
still
ranged
the
moods
of
her
timeless
consciousness
their
train
of
beauty
too
accompanied
them
i
can
not
half
recall
the
streams
of
passionate
description
with
which
his
words
clothed
these
glowing
memories
of
his
vision
great
pictures
of
it
haunt
the
background
of
my
mind
pictures
that
lie
in
early
mists
framed
by
the
stars
and
glimmering
through
some
golden
flowered
dawn
besides
the
huge
outlines
that
stood
breathing
in
the
background
like
dark
mountains
there
flitted
here
and
there
strange
dreamy
forms
of
almost
impossible
beauty
slender
as
lilies
eyes
soft
and
starry
shining
through
the
dusk
hair
flying
past
them
like
a
rain
of
summer
flowers
they
moved
down
all
the
pathways
of
the
earth
young
mind
singing
and
radiant
spring
blossoms
in
the
garden
of
her
consciousness
and
other
forms
more
vehement
and
rude
urged
to
and
fro
across
the
pictures
crowding
the
movement
some
playful
and
protean
some
clothed
as
with
trees
or
air
or
water
and
others
dark
remote
and
silent
ranging
her
deeper
layers
of
thought
and
dream
known
rarely
to
the
outer
world
at
all
the
rush
and
glory
of
it
all
is
more
than
my
mind
can
deal
with
i
gather
though
saw
no
definite
forms
but
rather
knew
forces
powers
aspects
of
this
soul
of
earth
facets
she
showed
in
days
to
men
certainly
the
very
infusoria
of
his
imagination
were
kindled
and
aflame
when
he
spoke
of
them
through
the
tangled
thicket
of
his
ordinary
mind
there
shone
this
passion
of
an
uncommon
loveliness
and
splendour
xxxvii
the
hours
when
the
mind
is
absorbed
by
beauty
are
the
only
hours
when
we
really
live
so
that
the
longer
we
can
stay
among
these
things
so
much
the
more
is
snatched
from
inevitable
time
richard
jefferies
in
the
relationship
that
his
everyday
mind
bore
to
his
present
state
there
lay
moreover
a
wealth
of
pregnant
suggestion
the
bridge
connecting
his
former
civilized
condition
with
this
cosmic
experience
was
a
curious
one
that
outer
lesser
state
it
seemed
had
known
a
foretaste
sometimes
of
the
greater
and
it
was
hence
had
come
those
dreams
of
a
golden
age
that
used
to
haunt
him
for
he
began
now
to
recall
the
existence
of
that
outer
world
of
men
and
women
though
by
means
of
certain
indefinite
channels
only
and
the
things
he
remembered
were
not
what
the
world
calls
important
they
were
moments
when
he
had
known
beauty
beauty
however
not
of
the
grandiose
sort
that
holds
the
crowd
but
of
so
simple
and
unadvertised
a
kind
that
most
men
overlook
it
altogether
he
understood
now
why
the
thrill
had
been
so
wonderful
he
saw
clearly
why
those
moments
of
ecstasy
he
had
often
felt
in
nature
used
to
torture
him
with
an
inexpressible
yearning
that
was
rather
pain
than
joy
for
they
were
precisely
what
he
now
experienced
when
the
viewless
figure
of
a
god
passed
by
him
down
there
out
there
below
in
that
cabined
lesser
state
they
had
been
partial
but
were
now
complete
those
moments
of
worship
he
had
known
in
woods
among
mountains
by
the
shores
of
desolate
seas
even
in
a
london
street
perhaps
at
the
sight
of
a
tree
in
spring
or
of
a
pathway
of
blue
sky
between
the
summer
clouds
these
had
been
one
and
all
tentative
partial
revelations
of
the
consciousness
of
the
soul
of
earth
he
now
knew
face
to
face
these
were
his
only
memories
of
that
outer
world
of
people
cities
or
of
civilization
apart
from
these
he
had
no
single
remembrance
certain
of
these
little
partial
foretastes
now
came
back
to
him
like
fragments
of
dream
that
trouble
the
waking
day
he
remembered
for
instance
one
definite
picture
a
hot
autumn
sun
upon
a
field
of
stubble
where
the
folded
stood
thistles
waving
by
the
hedges
a
yellow
field
of
mustard
rising
up
the
slope
against
the
and
beyond
a
row
of
peering
elms
that
rustled
in
the
wind
the
beauty
of
the
little
scene
was
somehow
poignant
he
recalled
it
vividly
it
had
flamed
about
him
transfiguring
the
world
he
had
trembled
yearning
to
see
more
for
just
behind
it
he
divined
with
an
exulting
passionate
worship
this
gorgeous
splendid
with
whom
at
last
he
now
actually
moved
in
that
instant
of
a
simple
loveliness
her
consciousness
had
fringed
his
own
had
bruised
it
he
had
known
it
only
by
the
partial
channels
of
sight
and
smell
and
hearing
but
had
felt
the
greater
thing
beyond
without
being
able
to
explain
it
and
a
portion
of
what
he
felt
had
burst
in
speech
from
his
lips
he
was
there
he
remembered
with
two
persons
a
man
and
woman
whose
name
and
face
however
he
could
not
summon
and
he
recalled
that
the
woman
smiled
incredulously
when
he
spoke
of
the
exquisite
perfume
of
those
folded
in
the
air
she
told
him
he
imagined
it
he
saw
again
the
pretty
woman
smile
of
incomprehension
he
saw
the
puzzled
expression
in
the
eyes
of
the
man
he
heard
him
murmur
something
prosaic
about
the
soul
about
birds
too
and
the
prospects
of
killing
hundreds
later
sport
he
even
saw
the
woman
picking
her
way
with
caution
as
though
the
touch
of
earth
could
stain
or
injure
her
he
especially
recalled
the
silence
that
had
followed
on
his
words
that
sought
to
show
them
beauty
he
remembered
too
above
all
the
sense
of
loneliness
among
men
that
it
induced
in
himself
but
the
memory
brought
him
a
curious
sharp
pain
and
turning
to
that
couple
who
were
now
his
playmates
in
this
garden
of
the
earth
he
called
them
with
a
singing
cry
and
cantered
over
leagues
of
flowers
wind
and
sunshine
before
he
stopped
again
they
leaped
and
danced
together
exulting
in
their
spacious
freedom
want
of
comprehension
no
longer
possible
the
memory
fled
away
he
shook
himself
free
of
it
then
others
came
in
its
place
another
and
another
not
all
with
people
blind
deaf
and
unreceptive
yet
all
of
common
simple
scenes
of
beauty
when
something
vast
had
surged
upon
him
and
broken
through
the
barriers
that
stand
between
the
heart
and
nature
such
curious
little
scenes
they
were
in
most
of
them
he
had
evidently
been
alone
but
one
and
all
had
touched
his
soul
with
a
foretaste
of
this
same
nameless
ecstasy
that
now
he
knew
complete
in
every
one
the
consciousness
of
the
earth
had
bruised
his
own
utterly
simple
they
had
been
one
and
all
these
partial
moments
of
blinding
beauty
in
that
lesser
outer
world
a
big
brown
clumsy
bee
he
saw
blundering
into
the
petals
of
a
wild
flower
on
which
the
dew
lay
sparkling
a
wisp
of
colored
cloud
driving
loosely
across
the
hills
dropping
a
purple
shadow
deep
waving
grass
plunging
and
shaking
in
the
wind
that
drew
out
its
underworld
of
blue
and
silver
over
the
whole
spread
surface
of
a
field
a
daisy
closed
for
the
night
upon
the
lawn
eyes
tightly
shut
hands
folded
a
south
wind
whispering
through
larches
the
pattering
of
summer
rain
upon
young
oak
leaves
in
the
dawn
fingers
of
long
blue
distance
upon
dreamy
woods
anemones
shaking
their
pale
and
starry
little
faces
in
the
wind
the
columned
stillness
of
a
in
the
dusk
young
birch
trees
mid
the
velvet
gloom
of
firs
the
new
moon
setting
in
a
cloud
of
stars
the
hush
of
stars
in
many
a
summer
night
sheep
grazing
idly
down
a
hill
a
path
of
moonlight
on
a
lake
a
little
wind
through
bare
and
wintry
woods
oh
he
recalled
the
wonder
loveliness
and
passion
of
a
thousand
more
they
thronged
and
passed
and
thronged
again
crowding
one
another
all
golden
moments
of
revelation
when
he
had
caught
glimpses
of
the
earth
and
her
greater
moods
had
swept
him
up
into
herself
moments
in
which
a
god
had
passed
these
were
his
only
memories
of
that
outer
world
he
had
left
behind
flashes
of
simple
beauty
was
thus
the
thrill
of
beauty
then
explained
was
loveliness
as
men
know
it
a
revelation
of
the
behind
and
were
the
blinding
flash
the
dazzling
wonder
and
the
dream
men
seek
to
render
permanent
in
music
color
line
and
language
a
vision
of
her
nakedness
down
there
the
poets
and
those
simple
enough
of
heart
to
stand
close
to
nature
could
catch
these
whispered
fragments
of
the
enormous
message
told
as
in
secret
but
now
against
her
very
heart
he
heard
the
thunder
of
the
thing
complete
now
in
the
glory
of
all
naked
bodily
forms
of
women
men
and
children
of
swift
animals
of
flowers
trees
and
running
water
of
mountains
and
of
seas
he
understood
these
partial
revelations
of
the
great
that
bore
them
gave
them
life
for
one
and
all
were
channels
for
her
loveliness
he
saw
the
beauty
of
the
natural
instincts
the
passion
of
motherhood
and
fatherhood
earth
seeking
to
project
herself
in
endless
forms
and
variety
he
understood
why
love
increased
the
heart
and
made
it
feel
at
one
with
all
the
world
moreover
in
some
amazing
fashion
he
was
aware
that
others
from
that
outer
world
beside
himself
had
access
here
and
that
from
this
garden
of
the
earth
deep
central
personality
came
all
the
inspiration
known
to
men
he
divined
that
others
were
even
now
drawing
upon
it
like
himself
the
thoughts
of
the
poets
went
past
him
like
thin
flames
the
dreams
of
millions
mute
inexpressible
yearnings
like
those
he
had
himself
once
known
streamed
by
in
pale
white
light
to
shoot
forward
with
a
little
nesting
rush
into
some
great
figure
and
then
return
in
double
volume
to
the
dreaming
heart
whence
first
they
issued
shadows
too
he
saw
by
myriads
faint
feeble
gropings
of
men
and
women
seeking
it
eagerly
yet
hardly
knowing
what
they
sought
but
above
all
long
singing
beautiful
tongues
of
colored
flame
that
were
the
instincts
of
divining
children
and
of
the
pure
in
heart
these
came
in
rippling
floods
unerringly
to
their
goal
lingered
for
long
periods
before
returning
and
all
he
knew
were
currents
of
the
great
earth
life
moods
thoughts
dreams
expressions
of
her
various
consciousness
with
which
she
mothered
fed
and
blessed
all
whom
it
was
possible
to
reach
their
passionate
yearning
their
worship
made
access
possible
along
the
tenderest
portions
of
her
personality
these
latter
came
as
by
a
spread
network
of
infinitely
delicate
filaments
that
extended
from
herself
deliciously
inviting
the
thing
however
that
remained
with
him
long
after
his
return
to
the
normal
state
of
lesser
consciousness
was
the
memory
of
those
blinding
moments
when
a
god
went
past
him
or
as
he
phrased
it
in
another
way
when
he
caught
glimpses
of
the
earth
naked
for
these
were
instantaneous
flashes
of
a
gleaming
whiteness
a
dazzling
and
supreme
loveliness
that
staggered
thought
and
arrested
feeling
while
yet
of
a
radiant
simplicity
that
brought
for
a
second
at
least
a
measure
of
comprehension
he
then
knew
not
mere
partial
projections
he
saw
beyond
deep
down
into
the
flaming
center
that
gave
them
birth
the
blending
of
his
being
with
the
cosmic
consciousness
was
complete
enough
for
this
he
describes
it
as
a
spectacle
of
sheer
glory
stupendous
even
terrifying
the
refulgent
majesty
of
it
utterly
possessed
him
the
shock
of
its
magnificence
came
moreover
upon
his
entire
being
and
was
not
really
of
course
a
sight
at
all
the
message
came
not
through
any
small
division
of
a
single
sense
with
a
massed
yet
soaring
power
it
shook
him
free
of
all
known
categories
he
then
fringed
a
region
of
yet
greater
being
wherein
he
tasted
for
a
moment
some
secret
comprehension
of
a
true
divinity
the
deliverance
into
ecstasy
was
complete
in
these
flashing
moments
when
a
second
seemed
a
thousand
years
he
further
the
splendor
of
the
stage
beyond
earth
in
her
turn
was
but
a
mood
in
the
consciousness
of
the
universe
that
universe
again
was
mothered
by
another
vaster
one
and
the
total
that
included
them
all
was
not
the
gods
but
god
xxxviii
the
litter
of
disordered
notebooks
filled
to
the
covers
with
fragments
of
such
beauty
that
they
almost
seem
to
burn
with
a
light
of
their
own
lies
at
this
moment
before
me
on
my
desk
i
still
hear
the
rushing
torrent
of
his
language
across
the
spotted
in
that
dark
restaurant
corner
but
the
incoherence
seems
only
to
increase
with
my
best
efforts
to
combine
the
two
go
home
and
dream
it
as
he
said
at
last
when
i
ventured
a
question
here
and
there
toward
the
end
of
the
recital
you
see
it
best
that
way
in
sleep
get
clear
away
from
and
my
surface
physical
consciousness
perhaps
it
will
come
to
you
then
there
remains
however
to
record
the
manner
of
his
exit
from
that
great
garden
of
the
earth
fair
youth
and
he
tells
it
more
simply
or
perhaps
it
is
that
i
understand
it
better
for
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
all
the
joy
and
splendor
that
he
tasted
there
came
unbidden
a
strengthening
of
the
tie
that
held
him
to
his
outer
lesser
state
a
wave
of
pity
and
compassion
surged
in
upon
him
from
the
depths
he
saw
the
struggling
millions
in
the
prisons
and
cages
civilization
builds
he
felt
them
no
happiness
he
understood
could
be
complete
that
did
not
also
include
them
all
and
he
longed
to
tell
them
the
thought
and
the
desire
tore
across
him
burningly
if
only
i
can
get
this
back
to
them
passed
through
him
like
a
flame
i
save
the
world
by
bringing
it
again
to
simple
things
only
got
to
tell
it
and
all
will
understand
at
once
and
follow
and
with
the
birth
of
the
desire
there
ran
a
deep
convulsive
sound
like
music
through
the
greater
consciousness
that
held
him
close
those
moods
that
were
the
gods
thronged
gloriously
about
him
almost
pressing
forwards
into
actual
sight
he
might
have
lingered
where
he
was
for
centuries
or
forever
but
this
thought
pulled
him
back
the
desire
to
share
his
knowledge
with
the
world
the
passion
to
heal
and
save
and
rescue
and
instantly
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eyelid
the
urwelt
closed
its
gates
of
horn
and
ivory
behind
him
an
immense
dark
shutter
dropped
noiselessly
with
a
speed
of
lightning
across
his
mind
he
stood
without
he
found
himself
near
the
stone
huts
of
a
hamlet
that
he
recognized
he
staggered
rubbed
his
eyes
and
stared
a
forest
of
beech
trees
shook
below
him
in
a
violent
wind
he
saw
the
branches
tossing
a
caucasian
beside
him
nosed
a
sack
that
spilt
its
flour
on
the
ground
at
his
feet
he
heard
the
animal
noisy
breathing
he
noted
the
sliding
movement
of
the
spilt
flour
before
it
finally
settled
and
some
fifty
yards
beyond
him
down
the
slopes
he
saw
a
human
figure
running
it
was
his
georgian
guide
the
man
half
stooping
caught
the
woolen
bashlik
that
had
fallen
from
his
head
watched
the
man
complete
the
gesture
still
running
he
replaced
the
cap
upon
his
head
and
coming
up
to
his
ears
upon
the
wind
were
the
words
of
a
broken
french
sentence
that
he
also
recognized
disjointed
by
terror
it
completed
an
interrupted
phrase
one
of
them
is
close
upon
us
hide
your
eyes
save
yourself
they
come
from
the
mountains
they
are
old
as
the
stones
run
no
other
living
being
was
in
sight
xxxix
the
extraordinary
abruptness
of
the
transition
produced
no
bewilderment
it
seems
realizing
that
without
rostom
he
would
be
in
a
position
of
helplessness
that
might
be
serious
the
irishman
put
his
hands
to
his
lips
and
called
out
with
authority
to
the
running
figure
of
his
frightened
guide
he
shouted
to
him
to
stop
there
is
nothing
to
fear
come
back
are
you
afraid
of
a
gust
of
wind
and
in
his
face
and
voice
perhaps
too
in
his
manner
was
something
he
had
brought
back
from
the
vision
for
the
man
stopped
at
once
in
his
headlong
course
paused
a
moment
to
stare
and
question
and
then
though
still
looking
over
his
shoulder
and
making
occasional
signs
of
his
religion
came
slowly
back
to
his
employer
side
again
it
has
passed
said
in
a
voice
that
seemed
to
crumble
in
his
mouth
it
is
gone
again
into
the
mountains
whence
it
came
we
are
safe
with
me
he
added
not
without
a
secret
sense
of
humor
stirring
in
him
you
will
always
be
safe
i
can
protect
us
both
he
felt
as
normal
as
a
british
officer
giving
orders
to
his
soldiers
and
the
georgian
slowly
recovered
his
composure
yet
for
a
long
time
keeping
close
to
the
other
side
the
transition
thus
had
been
as
sudden
and
complete
as
anything
well
could
be
described
it
as
the
instantaneous
dropping
of
a
shutter
across
his
mind
the
entire
vision
had
lasted
but
a
fraction
of
a
second
and
in
a
fraction
of
a
second
too
he
had
returned
to
his
state
of
everyday
lesser
consciousness
that
blending
with
the
great
consciousness
was
but
a
flashing
glimpse
after
all
the
extension
of
personality
had
been
momentary
so
absolute
moreover
was
the
return
that
at
first
remembering
nothing
he
took
up
life
again
exactly
where
he
had
left
it
the
guide
completed
the
gesture
and
the
sentence
which
the
vision
had
interrupted
and
similarly
resumed
his
own
thread
of
thought
and
action
only
a
hint
remained
that
and
a
curious
sense
of
interval
alone
were
left
to
witness
this
flash
of
an
immense
vision
of
cosmic
consciousness
that
apparently
had
filled
so
many
days
and
nights
it
was
like
waking
suddenly
in
the
night
out
of
deep
sleep
he
said
not
of
one
own
accord
or
gradually
but
as
when
someone
shakes
you
out
of
slumber
and
you
are
wide
awake
at
once
you
have
been
dreaming
vigorously
thick
lively
crowded
dreams
and
they
all
vanish
on
the
instant
you
catch
the
of
the
procession
just
as
diving
out
of
sight
in
less
than
a
second
all
is
gone
for
this
was
the
hint
that
remained
he
caught
the
flying
of
the
vision
he
knew
he
seen
something
but
for
the
moment
that
was
all
then
by
degrees
and
afterwards
the
details
in
the
days
that
followed
while
with
rostom
he
completed
the
journey
already
planned
the
deeper
consciousness
gave
back
its
memory
piece
by
piece
and
piece
by
piece
he
set
it
down
in
notebooks
as
best
he
could
the
memory
was
on
deposit
deep
within
him
and
at
intervals
he
tapped
it
hence
of
course
is
due
the
confused
and
fragmentary
character
of
those
bewildering
entries
hence
at
the
same
time
too
their
truth
and
value
for
here
was
no
imaginative
dream
concocted
in
a
mood
of
high
invention
the
parts
were
disjointed
incomplete
just
as
they
came
the
lesser
consciousness
it
seems
could
not
contain
the
thing
complete
nor
to
the
last
i
judge
did
he
ever
know
complete
recapture
they
wandered
for
two
weeks
and
more
about
the
mountains
meeting
various
adventure
by
the
way
reported
duly
in
his
letters
of
travel
but
these
concerned
the
outer
man
and
have
no
proper
place
in
this
strange
record
and
by
the
middle
of
july
he
found
himself
once
more
in
civilization
at
michaelevo
he
said
to
rostom
and
took
the
train
and
it
was
with
the
return
to
the
conditions
of
modern
life
that
the
reaction
set
in
and
stirred
the
deeper
layers
of
consciousness
to
reproduce
their
store
of
magic
for
this
return
to
what
seemed
the
paltry
activities
of
an
age
of
machinery
physical
luxury
and
superficial
contrivances
brought
him
a
sense
of
pain
that
was
acute
and
trenchant
more
a
deep
and
poignant
sense
of
loss
the
yearnings
no
longer
satisfied
began
again
to
reassert
themselves
it
was
not
the
actual
things
the
world
seemed
so
busy
about
that
pained
him
but
rather
the
point
of
view
from
which
the
world
approached
them
those
that
it
deemed
with
one
consent
important
and
those
with
rare
exceptions
it
obviously
deemed
worth
no
consideration
at
all
and
ignored
for
himself
these
values
stood
exactly
reversed
the
vision
then
came
back
to
him
rose
from
the
depths
blinded
his
eyes
with
maddening
beauty
sang
in
his
ears
possessed
his
heart
and
mind
he
burned
to
tell
it
the
world
of
tired
restless
men
he
felt
must
equally
burn
to
hear
it
some
vision
of
a
simple
life
lived
close
to
nature
came
before
his
inner
eye
as
the
remedy
for
the
vast
disease
of
restless
of
the
age
the
medicine
that
should
cure
the
entire
world
a
return
to
nature
was
the
first
step
toward
the
great
deliverance
men
sought
and
most
of
all
he
yearned
to
tell
it
first
to
heinrich
stahl
to
hear
him
talk
about
it
as
he
talked
perhaps
to
me
alone
was
genuinely
pathetic
for
here
in
terence
i
thought
to
see
the
essential
futility
of
all
dreamers
nakedly
revealed
his
vision
was
so
fine
sincere
and
noble
his
difficulty
in
imparting
it
so
painful
and
its
marriage
with
practical
action
so
ludicrously
impracticable
at
any
rate
that
combination
of
vision
and
action
called
sometimes
genius
which
can
shake
the
world
assuredly
was
not
his
for
his
was
no
constructive
mind
he
was
not
intellectual
he
but
with
the
heart
he
could
not
build
to
plan
a
new
utopia
was
as
impossible
to
him
as
to
shape
even
in
words
the
splendor
he
had
known
and
lived
bricks
and
straw
could
only
smother
him
before
he
laid
what
most
would
deem
foundations
at
first
too
in
those
days
while
waiting
for
the
steamer
in
batoum
he
kept
strangely
silent
even
in
his
own
thoughts
was
silence
he
could
not
speak
of
what
he
knew
even
paper
refused
it
but
all
the
time
this
glorious
winged
thing
that
yet
was
simple
as
the
sunlight
or
the
rain
went
by
his
side
while
his
soul
knew
the
relief
of
some
divine
proud
utterance
that
he
felt
could
never
know
complete
confession
in
speech
or
writing
later
he
stammered
over
it
to
his
notebooks
and
to
me
and
partially
also
to
stahl
but
at
first
it
dwelt
alone
and
hidden
contained
in
this
deep
silence
the
days
of
waiting
he
filled
with
walks
about
the
streets
watching
the
world
with
new
eyes
he
took
the
russian
steamer
to
poti
and
tramped
with
a
knapsack
up
the
tchourokh
gorge
beyond
bourtchka
regardless
of
the
turkish
gypsies
and
encampments
of
wild
peoples
on
the
banks
the
sense
of
personal
danger
was
impossible
he
felt
the
whole
world
kin
that
sense
protected
him
pistol
and
cartridges
lay
in
his
bag
forgotten
at
the
hotel
delight
and
pain
lay
oddly
mingled
in
him
the
pain
he
recognized
of
old
but
this
great
radiant
happiness
was
new
the
nightmare
of
modern
life
was
all
explained
unjustified
of
course
as
he
had
always
dimly
felt
symptom
of
deep
disorder
all
due
this
feverish
external
business
to
an
odd
misunderstanding
with
the
earth
humanity
had
somehow
quarreled
with
her
claiming
an
independence
that
could
not
really
last
for
her
the
centuries
of
this
estrangement
were
but
a
little
thing
perhaps
a
moment
or
two
in
that
huge
life
which
counted
a
million
years
to
lay
a
narrow
bed
of
chalk
they
would
come
back
in
time
meanwhile
she
ever
called
a
few
perhaps
already
dreamed
of
return
movements
he
had
heard
were
afoot
a
tentative
endeavor
here
and
there
they
heard
these
few
the
splendid
whisper
that
sweetly
calling
ever
passed
about
the
world
for
her
voice
in
the
last
resort
was
more
potent
than
all
others
an
enchantment
that
never
wholly
faded
men
had
but
temporarily
left
her
mighty
sides
and
gone
astray
eating
of
trees
of
knowledge
that
brought
them
deceptive
illusions
of
a
mad
fallen
away
into
the
pains
of
separateness
and
death
loss
of
direction
and
central
control
was
the
result
the
babel
of
many
tongues
so
clumsily
invented
by
which
all
turned
one
against
another
insubordinate
artificial
centers
had
assumed
disastrous
command
each
struggled
for
himself
against
his
neighbors
even
religions
fought
to
the
blood
a
single
sect
could
damn
the
rest
of
humanity
yet
in
the
same
breath
sing
complaisantly
of
its
own
heaven
meanwhile
she
smiled
in
love
and
patience
letting
them
learn
their
lesson
meanwhile
she
watched
and
waited
while
like
foolish
children
they
toiled
and
sweated
after
futile
transient
things
that
brought
no
single
letter
of
content
she
let
them
coin
their
millions
from
her
fairest
thoughts
the
gold
and
silver
in
her
veins
and
let
them
turn
it
into
engines
of
destruction
knowing
that
each
life
lost
returned
into
her
arms
and
heart
crying
with
the
pain
of
its
wayward
foolishness
the
lesson
learned
she
watched
their
tears
and
struggling
just
outside
the
open
nursery
door
knowing
they
must
at
length
return
for
food
and
while
thus
waiting
watching
she
heard
all
prayers
that
reached
her
she
answered
them
with
love
and
forgiveness
ever
ready
and
to
the
few
who
realized
their
folly
naughtiness
perhaps
at
worst
it
was
this
side
of
death
she
brought
full
measure
of
peace
and
joy
and
beauty
not
permanently
could
they
hurt
themselves
for
evil
was
but
distance
from
her
side
the
ignorance
of
those
who
had
wandered
furthest
into
the
little
dark
labyrinth
of
a
separated
self
the
intellect
they
were
so
proud
of
had
misled
them
and
sometimes
here
and
there
across
the
ages
with
a
glory
that
refused
utterly
to
be
denied
she
thundered
forth
her
old
sweet
message
of
deliverance
through
poet
priest
or
child
she
called
her
children
home
the
summons
rang
like
magic
across
the
wastes
of
this
dreary
separated
existence
some
heard
and
listened
some
turned
back
some
wondered
and
were
strangely
thrilled
some
thinking
it
too
simple
to
be
true
were
puzzled
by
the
yearning
and
the
tears
and
went
back
to
seek
for
a
more
difficult
way
while
most
denying
the
secret
glory
in
their
hearts
sought
to
persuade
themselves
they
loved
the
strife
and
hurrying
fever
best
at
other
times
again
she
chose
quite
different
ways
and
sent
the
amazing
message
in
a
flower
a
breath
of
evening
air
a
shell
upon
the
shore
though
oftenest
perhaps
it
hid
in
a
strain
of
music
a
patch
of
color
on
the
sea
or
hills
a
rustle
of
branches
in
a
little
twilight
wind
a
whisper
in
the
dusk
or
in
the
dawn
he
remembered
his
own
first
visions
of
it
only
never
could
the
summons
come
to
her
children
through
the
intellect
for
this
it
was
that
led
them
first
away
her
message
enters
ever
by
the
heart
the
simple
life
he
smiled
as
he
thought
of
the
bald
utopias
here
and
there
devised
by
men
for
he
had
seen
a
truth
whose
brilliance
smote
his
eyes
too
dazzlingly
to
permit
of
the
smallest
corner
of
darkness
remote
no
doubt
in
time
that
day
when
the
lion
shall
lie
down
with
the
lamb
and
men
shall
live
together
in
peace
and
gentleness
when
the
inner
life
shall
be
admitted
as
the
reality
strife
gain
and
loss
unknown
because
possessions
undesired
and
petty
selfhood
merged
in
the
larger
life
remote
of
course
yet
surely
not
impossible
he
had
seen
the
face
of
nature
heard
her
call
tasted
her
joy
and
peace
and
the
rest
of
the
tired
world
might
do
the
same
it
only
waited
to
be
shown
the
way
the
truth
he
now
saw
so
dazzling
was
that
all
who
heard
the
call
might
know
it
for
themselves
at
once
cuirassed
with
shining
love
that
makes
the
whole
world
kin
the
earth
a
mother
literally
divine
each
soul
might
thus
provide
a
channel
along
which
the
summons
home
should
pass
across
the
world
to
live
with
nature
and
share
her
greater
consciousness
for
states
yet
greater
nearer
to
the
eternal
home
this
was
the
beginning
of
the
truth
the
life
the
way
he
saw
religion
all
explained
and
those
hard
sayings
that
make
men
turn
away
the
imagined
dread
of
losing
life
to
find
it
the
counsel
of
perfection
that
the
neighbor
shall
be
loved
as
self
the
fancied
injury
and
outrage
that
made
it
hard
for
rich
men
to
enter
the
kingdom
of
these
as
of
a
hundred
other
sayings
he
saw
the
necessary
truth
it
all
seemed
easy
now
the
world
would
see
it
with
him
it
must
it
could
not
help
itself
simplicity
as
of
a
little
child
and
selflessness
as
of
the
mystic
these
were
the
splendid
clues
death
and
the
grave
indeed
had
lost
their
victory
for
in
the
stages
of
wider
consciousness
beyond
this
transient
physical
phase
he
saw
all
loved
ones
joined
and
safe
as
separate
words
upgathered
each
to
each
in
the
parent
sentence
that
explains
them
the
sentence
in
the
paragraph
the
paragraph
in
the
whole
grand
story
all
achieved
and
so
at
length
into
the
eternal
library
of
god
that
consummates
the
whole
he
saw
the
glorious
series
timeless
and
serene
advancing
to
the
climax
and
somehow
understood
that
individuality
at
each
stage
was
never
lost
but
rather
extended
and
magnified
love
of
the
earth
life
close
to
nature
and
denial
of
civilization
was
the
first
step
upwards
in
the
simple
life
in
this
return
to
nature
lay
the
opening
of
the
little
path
that
climbed
to
the
stars
and
heaven
xl
at
the
end
of
the
week
the
little
steamer
dropped
her
anchor
in
the
harbor
and
the
irishman
booked
his
passage
home
he
was
standing
on
the
wharf
to
watch
the
unloading
when
a
hand
tapped
him
on
the
shoulder
and
he
heard
a
voice
his
heart
leaped
with
pleasure
there
were
no
preliminaries
between
these
two
i
am
glad
to
see
you
safe
you
did
not
find
your
friend
then
looked
at
the
bronzed
face
beside
him
noted
the
ragged
beard
and
saw
the
look
of
genuine
welcome
in
the
twinkling
brown
eyes
he
watched
him
lift
his
cap
and
mop
that
familiar
dome
of
bald
head
i
safe
was
all
he
answered
because
i
found
him
for
a
moment
stahl
looked
puzzled
he
dropped
the
hand
he
held
so
tightly
and
led
him
down
the
wharf
we
get
out
of
this
devilish
sun
he
said
leading
the
way
among
the
tangle
of
merchandise
and
bales
it
enough
to
boil
our
brains
they
passed
through
the
crowd
of
swarthy
dripping
turks
georgians
persians
and
armenians
who
labored
half
naked
in
the
heat
and
moved
toward
the
town
a
russian
gunboat
lay
in
the
bay
side
by
side
with
freight
and
passenger
vessels
an
steamer
took
on
cargo
the
scene
was
drenched
in
sunshine
the
black
sea
gleamed
like
molten
metal
beyond
the
wooded
spurs
of
the
caucasus
climbed
through
haze
into
cloudless
blue
it
beautiful
remarked
the
german
pointing
to
the
distant
coastline
but
hardly
with
the
beauty
of
those
grecian
isles
we
passed
together
eh
he
watched
him
closely
you
coming
back
on
our
steamer
he
asked
in
the
same
breath
it
beautiful
answered
ignoring
the
question
because
it
lives
but
there
is
dust
upon
its
outer
loveliness
dust
that
has
gathered
through
long
ages
of
neglect
dust
that
i
would
sweep
away
learnt
how
to
do
it
he
taught
me
stahl
did
not
even
look
at
him
though
the
words
were
wild
enough
he
walked
at
his
side
in
silence
perhaps
he
partly
understood
for
this
first
link
with
the
outer
world
of
appearances
was
difficult
for
him
to
pick
up
the
person
of
stahl
with
the
civilization
whence
he
came
had
brought
it
and
out
of
the
ocean
of
glorious
vision
in
his
soul
took
at
random
the
first
phrases
he
could
find
yes
i
booked
a
passage
on
your
steamer
he
added
presently
remembering
the
question
it
did
not
seem
strange
to
him
that
his
companion
ignored
both
clues
he
offered
he
knew
the
man
too
well
for
that
it
was
only
that
he
waited
for
more
before
he
spoke
they
went
to
the
little
table
outside
the
hotel
pavement
where
several
weeks
ago
they
had
drunk
kakhetian
wine
together
and
talked
of
deeper
things
the
german
called
for
a
bottle
mineral
water
ice
and
cigarettes
and
while
they
sipped
the
cooling
golden
liquid
hats
off
and
coats
on
the
backs
of
their
chairs
stahl
gave
him
the
news
of
the
world
of
men
and
events
that
had
transpired
meanwhile
listened
vaguely
as
he
smoked
it
seemed
remote
unreal
almost
fantastic
this
long
string
of
ugly
frantic
happenings
all
symptoms
of
some
disordered
state
that
was
like
illness
the
scream
of
politics
the
roar
and
rattle
of
financial
crashes
furious
labor
upheavals
rumors
of
war
the
death
of
kings
and
magnates
awful
accidents
and
strange
turmoil
in
enormous
cities
details
of
some
sad
prison
life
it
almost
seemed
pain
and
distress
and
strife
the
note
that
bound
them
all
together
men
were
mastered
by
these
things
instead
of
mastering
them
these
unimportant
things
they
thought
would
make
them
free
only
imprisoned
them
they
lunched
there
at
the
little
table
in
the
shade
and
in
turn
the
irishman
gave
an
outline
of
his
travels
stahl
had
asked
for
it
and
listened
attentively
the
pictures
interested
him
you
done
your
letters
for
the
papers
he
questioned
him
and
now
perhaps
you
write
a
book
as
well
something
may
force
its
way
out
come
blundering
thundering
out
in
fragments
yes
you
mean
you
rather
not
i
mean
it
all
too
big
and
overwhelming
he
showed
me
such
blinding
splendors
i
might
tell
it
but
as
to
writing
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
this
time
stahl
ignored
no
longer
he
took
him
up
but
not
with
any
expected
words
or
questions
he
merely
said
my
friend
something
that
i
have
to
tell
you
or
rather
i
should
say
to
show
you
he
looked
most
keenly
at
him
and
in
the
old
familiar
way
he
placed
a
hand
upon
his
shoulder
his
voice
grew
soft
it
may
upset
you
it
may
unsettle
prove
a
shock
perhaps
but
if
you
are
prepared
we
go
what
kind
of
shock
asked
startled
a
moment
by
the
gravity
of
manner
the
shock
of
death
was
the
answer
gently
spoken
the
irishman
only
knew
a
swift
rush
of
joy
and
wonder
as
he
heard
it
but
there
is
no
such
thing
he
cried
almost
with
laughter
he
taught
me
that
above
all
else
there
is
no
death
there
is
away
though
came
the
rejoinder
spoken
low
there
is
earth
to
earth
and
dust
to
dust
that
of
the
body
that
of
the
body
yes
the
older
man
repeated
darkly
there
is
only
home
escape
and
freedom
i
tell
you
only
that
it
nothing
but
joy
and
splendor
when
you
really
understand
but
stahl
made
no
immediate
answer
nor
any
comment
he
paid
the
bill
and
led
him
down
the
street
they
took
the
shady
side
passing
beyond
the
skirts
of
the
town
they
walked
in
silence
the
barracks
where
the
soldiers
sang
the
railway
line
to
tiflis
and
baku
the
dome
and
minarets
of
the
church
were
left
behind
in
turn
and
presently
they
reached
the
hot
straight
dusty
road
that
fringed
the
sea
they
heard
the
crashing
of
the
little
waves
and
saw
the
foam
creamily
white
against
the
dark
grey
pebbles
of
the
beach
and
when
they
reached
a
small
enclosure
where
thin
trees
were
planted
among
sparse
grass
all
brown
and
withered
by
the
sun
they
paused
and
stahl
pointed
to
a
mound
marked
at
either
end
by
rough
stone
boulder
a
date
was
on
it
but
no
name
calculated
the
difference
between
the
russian
calendar
and
the
one
he
was
accustomed
to
stahl
checked
him
the
fifteenth
of
june
the
german
said
the
fifteenth
of
june
yes
said
very
slowly
but
with
wonder
and
excitement
in
his
heart
that
was
the
day
that
rostom
tried
to
run
away
the
day
i
saw
him
come
to
me
from
the
trees
the
day
we
started
off
together
to
the
garden
he
turned
to
his
companion
questioningly
for
a
moment
the
rush
of
memory
was
quite
bewildering
he
never
left
batoum
at
all
you
see
stahl
continued
without
looking
up
he
went
straight
to
the
hospital
the
day
we
came
into
port
i
was
summoned
to
him
in
the
night
that
last
night
while
you
slept
so
deeply
his
old
strange
fever
was
upon
him
then
and
i
took
him
ashore
before
the
other
passengers
were
astir
i
brought
him
to
the
hospital
myself
and
he
never
left
his
bed
he
pointed
down
to
the
little
nameless
grave
at
their
feet
where
a
wandering
wind
from
the
sea
just
stirred
the
grasses
that
was
the
date
on
which
he
died
he
went
away
in
the
early
morning
he
added
in
a
low
voice
that
held
both
sadness
and
sympathy
he
went
home
said
the
irishman
a
tide
of
joy
rising
tumultuously
through
his
heart
as
he
remembered
the
secret
of
that
complete
and
absolute
leadership
was
out
he
understood
it
all
it
had
been
a
spiritual
adventure
to
the
last
then
followed
a
pause
in
silence
they
stood
there
for
some
minutes
there
grew
no
flowers
on
that
grave
but
stooped
down
and
picked
a
strand
of
the
withered
grass
he
put
it
carefully
between
the
pages
of
his
notebook
and
then
lying
flat
against
the
ground
where
the
sunshine
fell
in
a
patch
of
white
and
burning
glory
he
pressed
his
lips
to
the
crumbling
soil
he
kissed
the
earth
oblivious
of
stahl
presence
or
at
least
ignoring
it
he
worshipped
and
while
he
did
so
he
heard
that
little
sound
he
loved
so
well
which
more
than
any
words
or
music
brought
peace
and
joy
because
it
told
his
passion
all
complete
with
his
ears
close
to
the
earth
he
heard
it
yet
at
the
same
time
heard
it
everywhere
for
it
came
with
the
falling
of
the
waves
upon
the
shore
through
the
murmur
of
the
rustling
branches
overhead
and
even
across
the
whispering
of
the
withered
grass
about
him
deep
down
in
the
center
of
the
mothering
earth
he
heard
it
too
in
faintly
rising
pulse
it
was
the
exquisite
little
piping
on
a
reed
the
ancient
fluting
of
the
everlasting
pan
and
when
he
rose
he
found
that
stahl
had
turned
away
and
was
gazing
at
the
sea
as
though
he
had
not
noticed
doctor
he
cried
yet
so
softly
it
was
a
whisper
rather
than
a
call
i
heard
it
then
again
it
everywhere
oh
tell
me
that
you
hear
it
too
stahl
turned
and
looked
at
him
in
silence
there
was
a
moisture
in
his
eyes
and
on
his
face
a
look
of
softness
that
a
woman
might
have
worn
i
brought
it
back
you
see
i
brought
it
back
for
that
the
message
that
the
sound
and
music
i
must
give
to
all
the
world
no
words
no
book
can
tell
it
his
hat
was
off
his
eyes
were
shining
his
voice
broke
with
the
passion
of
joy
he
yearned
to
share
yet
knew
so
little
how
to
impart
if
i
can
pipe
upon
the
flutes
of
pan
the
millions
all
will
listen
will
understand
and
follow
tell
me
oh
tell
me
that
heard
it
too
my
friend
my
dear
young
friend
the
german
murmured
in
a
voice
of
real
tenderness
you
heard
it
truly
but
you
heard
it
in
your
heart
few
hear
the
pipes
of
pan
as
you
do
few
care
to
listen
today
the
world
is
full
of
other
sounds
that
drown
it
and
even
of
those
who
hear
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
he
led
him
away
toward
the
sea
how
few
will
care
to
follow
how
fewer
still
will
and
while
they
lay
upon
the
beach
and
watched
the
line
of
foam
against
their
feet
and
saw
the
seagulls
curving
idly
in
the
blue
and
shining
air
he
added
underneath
his
breath
hardly
caught
the
murmur
of
his
words
so
low
he
murmured
them
the
simple
life
is
lost
forever
it
lies
asleep
in
the
golden
age
and
only
those
who
sleep
and
dream
can
ever
find
it
if
you
would
keep
your
joy
dream
on
my
friend
dream
on
but
dream
alone
xli
summer
blazed
everywhere
and
the
sea
lay
like
a
blue
pool
of
melted
sky
and
sunshine
the
summits
of
the
caucasus
soon
faded
to
the
east
and
north
and
to
the
south
the
wooded
hills
of
the
black
sea
coast
accompanied
the
ship
in
a
line
of
wavy
blue
that
joined
the
water
and
the
sky
indistinguishably
the
passengers
were
few
hardly
noticed
their
existence
even
an
american
engineer
building
a
railway
in
turkey
came
on
board
at
trebizond
there
were
one
or
two
light
women
on
their
way
home
from
baku
and
the
attaché
of
a
foreign
embassy
from
teheran
but
the
irishman
felt
more
in
touch
with
the
hundred
who
joined
the
ship
at
ineboli
from
the
interior
of
asia
minor
and
were
bound
as
emigrants
for
marseilles
and
far
america
ragged
very
dirty
they
had
never
seen
the
sea
before
and
the
sight
of
a
porpoise
held
them
spellbound
they
lived
on
the
mostly
cooking
their
own
food
the
women
and
children
sleeping
beneath
a
large
tarpaulin
that
the
sailors
stretched
for
them
across
the
width
of
deck
at
night
they
played
their
pipes
and
danced
singing
shouting
and
waving
their
arms
always
the
same
tune
over
and
over
again
watched
them
for
hours
together
he
also
watched
the
engineer
the
women
the
attaché
he
understood
the
difference
between
them
as
he
had
never
understood
it
before
he
understood
the
difficulty
of
his
task
as
well
how
in
the
world
could
he
ever
explain
a
single
syllable
of
his
message
to
these
latter
or
waken
in
them
the
faintest
echo
of
desire
to
know
and
listen
the
peasants
though
all
unconscious
of
the
blinding
glory
at
their
elbows
stood
far
nearer
to
the
truth
been
further
east
i
suppose
the
engineer
observed
one
afternoon
as
the
steamer
lay
off
broussa
taking
on
a
little
extra
cargo
of
walnut
logs
he
looked
admiringly
at
the
irishman
bronzed
skin
take
a
better
sun
than
this
to
put
that
on
he
laughed
in
his
breezy
vigorous
way
and
the
other
laughed
with
him
previous
conversations
had
already
paved
the
way
to
a
friendship
and
the
american
had
taken
to
him
up
in
the
mountains
he
replied
camping
out
and
sleeping
in
the
sun
did
it
the
caucasus
ah
i
like
to
get
up
there
myself
a
bit
i
told
they
a
wonderful
thing
in
the
mountain
line
scenery
for
him
was
evidently
a
commercial
commodity
or
it
was
nothing
it
was
the
most
nation
in
the
world
that
spoke
in
the
van
of
civilization
representing
the
last
word
in
progress
due
to
triumph
over
nature
said
he
had
never
seen
anything
like
them
he
described
the
trees
the
flowers
the
tribes
the
scenery
in
general
he
dwelt
upon
the
vast
uncultivated
spaces
the
amazing
fruitfulness
of
the
soil
the
gorgeous
beauty
above
all
i
like
to
get
the
overcrowded
cities
of
england
and
europe
spread
all
over
it
he
said
with
enthusiasm
there
is
room
for
thousands
there
to
lead
a
simple
life
close
to
nature
in
health
and
peace
and
happiness
even
your
tired
millionaires
could
escape
their
restless
feverish
worries
lay
down
their
weary
burden
of
possessions
and
enjoy
the
earth
at
last
the
poor
would
cease
to
be
with
us
life
become
true
and
beautiful
again
he
let
it
pour
out
of
him
building
the
scaffolding
of
his
dream
before
him
in
the
air
and
filling
it
in
with
beauty
the
american
listened
in
patience
watching
the
walnut
logs
being
towed
through
the
water
to
the
side
of
the
ship
from
time
to
time
he
spat
on
them
or
into
the
sea
he
let
the
beauty
go
completely
past
him
great
idea
that
he
interrupted
at
length
you
interested
i
see
in
socialism
and
communistic
schemes
there
money
in
them
somewhere
right
enough
if
a
man
only
could
hit
the
right
note
at
the
first
go
off
take
a
bit
of
doing
though
one
of
the
women
from
baku
came
up
and
leaned
upon
the
rails
a
little
beyond
them
the
sickly
odor
of
artificial
scent
wafted
down
the
attaché
strolled
along
the
deck
and
ogled
her
get
a
few
of
that
sort
to
draw
the
millionaires
in
eh
he
added
vulgarly
even
those
would
come
yes
said
the
irishman
softly
realizing
for
the
first
time
within
his
memory
that
his
gorge
did
not
rise
for
they
too
would
change
grow
clean
and
sweet
and
beautiful
the
engineer
looked
sharply
into
his
face
uncertain
whether
he
had
not
missed
a
clever
witticism
of
his
own
kind
but
did
not
meet
his
glance
his
eyes
were
far
away
upon
the
snowy
summit
of
olympus
where
a
flock
of
fleecy
clouds
hung
hovering
like
the
hair
of
the
eternal
gods
they
say
there
timber
going
to
waste
that
you
could
get
to
the
coast
merely
for
the
cost
of
drawing
it
caucasian
walnut
too
to
burn
the
other
continued
getting
on
to
safer
ground
and
labor
dirt
cheap
there
every
sort
of
mineral
too
god
ever
made
you
could
build
light
railways
and
run
the
show
by
electricity
and
for
the
asking
you
have
to
get
a
concession
from
russia
first
though
he
added
spitting
down
upon
a
huge
floating
log
in
the
clear
sea
underneath
and
russia
got
palms
that
want
a
lot
of
greasing
i
guess
the
natives
too
would
take
a
bit
of
managing
the
woman
beyond
had
shifted
several
feet
nearer
and
after
a
pause
the
irishman
found
no
words
to
fill
his
companion
turned
to
address
a
remark
to
her
took
the
opening
and
moved
away
here
my
card
anyway
the
american
added
handing
him
an
bit
of
large
pasteboard
from
a
fat
that
bore
his
name
and
address
in
silver
on
the
outside
if
you
develop
the
scheme
and
want
a
bit
of
money
count
me
in
he
went
to
the
other
side
of
the
vessel
and
watched
the
peasants
on
the
lower
deck
their
dirt
seemed
nothing
by
comparison
it
was
only
on
their
clothes
and
bodies
the
odor
of
this
unwashed
humanity
was
almost
sweet
and
wholesome
it
cleansed
the
sickly
taint
of
that
other
scent
from
his
palate
it
washed
his
mind
of
thoughts
as
well
he
stood
there
long
in
dreaming
silence
while
the
sunlight
on
olympus
turned
from
gold
to
rose
and
the
sea
took
on
the
colors
of
the
fading
sky
he
watched
a
dark
kurd
baby
sliding
down
the
tarpaulin
a
kitten
was
playing
with
a
loose
end
of
rope
too
heavy
for
it
to
move
further
off
a
huge
fellow
with
bared
chest
and
the
hands
of
a
colossus
sat
on
a
pile
of
canvas
playing
softly
on
his
wooden
pipes
the
dark
hair
fell
across
his
eyes
and
a
group
of
women
listened
idly
while
they
busied
themselves
with
the
cooking
of
the
evening
meal
immediately
beneath
him
a
young
woman
crammed
a
baby
to
her
naked
breast
the
kitten
left
the
rope
and
played
with
the
tassel
of
her
scarlet
shawl
and
as
he
heard
those
pipes
and
watched
the
grave
untamed
strong
faces
of
those
wild
peasant
men
and
women
he
understood
that
low
though
they
might
be
in
scale
of
evolution
there
was
yet
absent
from
them
the
touch
of
that
deteriorating
which
civilization
painted
into
those
other
countenances
but
whether
the
word
he
sought
was
degradation
or
whether
it
was
shame
he
could
not
tell
in
all
they
did
the
way
they
moved
their
dignity
and
independence
there
was
this
something
he
felt
that
bordered
on
being
impressive
their
wants
were
few
their
worldly
possessions
in
a
bundle
yet
they
had
this
thing
that
set
them
in
a
place
apart
if
not
above
these
others
beyond
that
simpering
attaché
for
all
his
worldly
diplomacy
that
engineer
with
brains
and
skill
those
painted
women
with
their
clever
playing
upon
the
feelings
and
desires
of
their
kind
there
this
difference
that
set
the
ragged
dirty
crew
in
a
proud
and
quiet
atmosphere
that
made
them
seem
almost
distinguished
by
comparison
and
certainly
more
desirable
rough
and
untutored
though
they
doubtless
were
they
still
possessed
unspoiled
that
deeper
and
more
elemental
nature
that
bound
them
closer
to
the
earth
it
needed
training
guidance
purifying
yes
but
in
the
last
resort
was
it
not
of
greater
spiritual
significance
and
value
than
the
mode
of
comparatively
reason
by
which
civilization
had
produced
these
other
types
he
watched
them
long
the
sun
sank
out
of
sight
the
sea
turned
dark
ten
thousand
stars
shone
softly
in
the
sky
and
while
the
steamer
swung
about
and
made
for
peaked
andros
and
the
coast
of
greece
he
still
stood
on
in
reverie
and
wonder
the
wings
of
his
great
dream
stirred
mightily
and
he
saw
pale
millions
of
men
and
women
trooping
through
the
gates
of
horn
and
ivory
into
that
garden
where
they
should
find
peace
and
happiness
in
clean
simplicity
close
to
the
earth
xlii
there
followed
four
days
then
of
sea
greece
left
behind
messina
and
the
lipari
islands
past
and
the
blue
outline
of
sardinia
and
corsica
began
to
keep
pace
with
them
as
they
neared
the
narrow
straits
of
bonifacio
between
them
the
passengers
came
up
to
watch
the
rocky
desolate
shores
slip
by
so
close
and
captain
burgenfelder
was
on
the
bridge
rocks
rose
everywhere
close
about
the
ship
overhead
the
seagulls
cried
and
circled
no
vegetation
was
visible
on
either
shore
no
houses
no
abode
of
man
nothing
but
the
lighthouses
then
miles
of
deserted
rock
dressed
in
those
splendors
of
the
sun
the
had
sounded
but
the
sight
was
too
magnificent
to
leave
for
the
setting
sun
floated
on
an
emblazoned
sea
and
stared
straight
against
them
in
level
glory
down
the
narrow
passage
unimaginable
colors
painted
sky
and
wave
the
ruddy
cliffs
of
bleak
loneliness
rose
from
a
bed
of
flame
soft
airs
fanned
the
cheeks
with
welcome
coolness
after
the
fierce
heat
of
the
day
there
was
a
scent
of
wild
honey
in
the
air
borne
from
the
purple
uplands
far
far
away
i
wonder
oh
i
wonder
if
they
realized
that
a
god
is
passing
close
the
irishman
murmured
with
a
rising
of
the
heart
and
that
here
is
a
great
mood
of
the
inviting
them
to
peace
or
do
they
merely
see
a
yellow
sun
that
dips
beneath
a
violet
sea
the
washing
of
the
water
past
the
steamer
sides
caught
away
the
rest
of
the
words
he
remembered
that
host
of
many
thousand
heads
that
bowed
in
silence
while
a
god
swept
by
it
was
almost
a
shock
to
hear
a
voice
replying
close
beside
him
come
to
my
cabin
when
you
ready
my
windows
open
to
the
west
we
can
be
alone
together
we
can
have
there
what
food
we
need
you
would
prefer
it
perhaps
he
felt
the
touch
of
that
sympathetic
hand
upon
his
shoulder
and
bent
his
head
to
signify
agreement
for
a
moment
face
to
face
with
that
superb
sunset
he
had
known
a
deep
and
utter
peace
in
the
vast
bosom
of
this
greater
soul
about
him
her
consciousness
again
had
bruised
and
fringed
his
own
across
that
delicately
divided
threshold
the
beauty
and
the
power
of
the
gods
had
poured
in
a
flood
into
his
being
and
only
there
was
peace
only
there
was
joy
only
there
was
the
death
of
those
ancient
yearnings
that
tortured
his
little
personal
and
separate
existence
the
return
to
the
world
was
aching
pain
again
the
old
loneliness
that
seemed
more
than
he
could
bear
swept
icily
through
him
contracting
life
and
freezing
every
spring
of
joy
for
in
that
single
instant
of
return
he
felt
pass
into
him
a
loneliness
of
the
whole
travailing
world
the
loneliness
of
countless
centuries
the
loneliness
of
all
the
races
of
the
earth
who
were
exiled
and
had
lost
the
way
too
deep
it
lay
for
words
or
tears
or
sighs
the
doctor
invitation
came
most
opportunely
and
presently
in
silence
he
turned
his
back
upon
that
opal
sky
of
dream
from
which
the
sun
had
gone
and
walked
slowly
down
the
deck
toward
stahl
cabin
if
only
i
can
share
it
with
them
he
thought
as
he
went
if
only
men
will
listen
if
only
they
will
come
to
keep
it
all
to
myself
to
dream
alone
will
kill
me
and
as
he
stood
before
the
door
it
seemed
he
heard
wild
rushing
through
the
sky
the
tramping
of
a
thousand
hoofs
a
roaring
of
the
wind
the
joy
of
that
free
torrential
passage
with
the
earth
he
turned
the
handle
and
entered
the
cozy
room
where
weeks
before
they
held
the
inquest
on
the
little
empty
tenement
of
flesh
remembering
how
that
other
figure
had
once
stood
where
he
now
stood
part
of
the
sunrise
part
of
the
sea
part
of
the
morning
winds
they
had
their
meal
almost
in
silence
while
the
glow
of
sunset
filled
the
cabin
through
the
western
row
of
and
when
it
was
over
stahl
made
the
coffee
as
of
old
and
lit
the
familiar
black
cigar
slowly
pain
and
restlessness
gave
way
before
the
soothing
quiet
he
had
never
known
him
before
so
calm
and
gentle
so
sympathetic
almost
tender
the
usual
sarcasm
seemed
veiled
in
sadness
there
was
no
irony
in
the
voice
nor
mockery
in
the
eyes
then
to
the
irishman
it
came
suddenly
that
all
these
days
while
he
had
been
lost
in
dreaming
the
doctor
had
kept
him
as
of
old
under
close
observation
the
completeness
of
his
reverie
had
concealed
from
him
this
steady
scrutiny
he
had
been
oblivious
to
the
fact
that
stahl
had
all
the
time
been
watching
investigating
keenly
examining
abruptly
he
now
realized
it
and
then
stahl
spoke
his
tone
was
winning
his
manner
frank
and
inviting
but
it
was
the
sadness
about
him
that
won
confidence
so
wholly
i
can
guess
he
said
something
of
the
dream
you
brought
with
you
from
those
mountains
i
can
understand
more
perhaps
than
you
imagine
and
i
can
sympathize
more
than
you
think
possible
tell
me
about
it
fully
if
you
can
i
see
your
heart
is
very
full
and
in
the
telling
you
will
find
relief
i
am
not
hostile
as
you
sometimes
feel
tell
me
my
dear
young
friend
tell
me
your
vision
and
your
hope
perhaps
i
might
even
help
for
there
may
be
things
that
i
could
also
tell
to
you
in
return
something
in
the
choice
of
words
none
of
which
offended
in
the
atmosphere
and
setting
no
detail
of
which
jarred
and
in
the
degree
of
balance
between
utterance
and
silence
his
world
of
inner
forces
just
then
knew
combined
to
make
the
invitation
irresistible
moreover
he
had
wanted
to
tell
it
all
these
days
stahl
was
already
half
convinced
stahl
would
surely
understand
and
help
him
it
was
the
psychological
moment
for
confession
the
two
men
rose
in
the
same
moment
stahl
to
lock
the
cabin
doors
against
interruption
to
set
their
chairs
more
closely
side
by
side
so
that
talking
should
be
easiest
and
then
without
demur
or
hesitation
he
opened
his
heart
to
this
other
and
let
the
floodgates
of
his
soul
swing
wide
he
told
the
vision
and
he
told
the
dream
he
told
his
hope
as
well
and
the
story
of
his
passion
filled
in
with
pages
from
those
notebooks
he
ever
carried
in
his
pocket
still
lasted
when
the
western
glow
had
faded
from
the
sky
and
the
stars
shone
down
upon
the
gliding
steamer
the
hush
of
night
lay
soft
upon
the
world
before
he
finished
he
told
the
thing
complete
much
i
imagine
as
he
told
it
all
to
me
upon
the
roof
of
that
apartment
building
and
in
the
dingy
soho
restaurant
he
told
it
without
reservations
his
yearnings
the
explanation
brought
by
the
presence
of
the
silent
stranger
upon
the
outward
voyage
the
journey
to
the
garden
the
vision
that
all
life
from
gods
to
flowers
from
men
to
mountains
lay
contained
in
the
conscious
being
of
the
earth
that
beauty
was
but
glimpses
of
her
essential
nakedness
and
that
salvation
of
the
world
disease
of
modern
life
was
to
be
found
in
a
general
return
to
the
simplicity
of
nature
close
against
her
mothering
heart
he
told
it
all
in
words
that
his
passionate
joy
chose
faultlessly
and
heinrich
stahl
in
silence
listened
he
asked
no
single
question
he
made
no
movement
in
his
chair
his
black
cigar
went
out
before
the
half
of
it
was
smoked
the
darkness
hid
his
face
impenetrably
and
no
one
came
to
interrupt
the
murmur
of
the
speeding
steamer
and
occasional
footsteps
on
the
deck
as
passengers
passed
to
and
fro
in
the
cool
of
the
night
were
the
only
sounds
that
broke
the
music
of
that
incurable
idealist
impassioned
story
xliii
and
then
at
length
there
came
a
change
of
voice
across
the
cabin
the
irishman
had
finished
he
sank
back
in
the
deep
leather
chair
exhausted
physically
but
with
the
exultation
of
his
mighty
hope
still
pouring
at
full
strength
through
his
heart
for
he
had
ventured
further
than
ever
before
and
had
spoken
of
a
possible
crusade
a
crusade
that
should
preach
peace
and
happiness
to
every
living
creature
and
stahl
in
a
voice
that
showed
how
deeply
he
was
moved
asked
quietly
by
leading
the
nations
back
to
nature
you
think
they
shall
advance
to
truth
at
last
with
time
was
the
reply
the
first
step
lies
there
in
changing
the
direction
of
the
world
activities
changing
it
from
the
transient
outer
to
the
eternal
inner
in
the
simple
life
external
possessions
unnecessary
and
recognized
as
vain
the
soul
would
turn
within
and
seek
reality
only
a
tiny
section
of
humanity
has
time
to
do
it
now
there
is
no
leisure
civilization
means
acquirement
for
the
body
it
ought
to
mean
development
for
the
soul
once
sweep
aside
the
trash
and
rubbish
men
seek
outside
themselves
today
and
the
wings
of
their
smothered
souls
would
stir
again
consciousness
would
expand
nature
would
draw
them
first
they
would
come
to
feel
the
earth
as
i
did
self
would
disappear
and
with
it
this
false
sense
of
separateness
the
greater
consciousness
would
waken
in
them
the
peace
and
joy
and
blessedness
of
inner
growth
would
fill
their
lives
but
first
this
childish
battling
to
the
death
for
external
things
must
cease
and
civilization
stand
revealed
for
the
bleak
and
empty
desolate
thing
it
really
is
it
leads
away
from
god
and
from
the
things
that
are
eternal
the
german
made
no
answer
ceased
to
speak
a
long
silence
fell
between
them
then
presently
stahl
relighted
his
cigar
and
lapsing
into
his
native
tongue
always
a
sign
with
him
of
deepest
seriousness
he
began
to
talk
you
honored
me
he
said
with
a
great
confidence
and
i
am
deeply
deeply
grateful
you
have
told
your
inmost
dream
the
thing
men
find
it
hardest
of
all
to
speak
about
he
felt
in
the
darkness
for
his
companion
hand
and
held
it
tightly
for
a
moment
he
made
no
other
comment
upon
what
he
had
heard
and
in
return
in
some
small
way
of
return
he
continued
i
may
ask
you
to
listen
to
something
of
my
own
something
of
possible
interest
no
one
has
ever
known
it
from
my
lips
only
in
our
earlier
conversations
on
the
outward
voyage
i
hinted
at
it
once
or
twice
i
sometimes
warned
you
i
remember
you
said
he
me
me
over
was
the
word
you
used
i
suggested
caution
yes
urged
you
not
to
let
yourself
go
too
completely
told
you
he
represented
danger
to
yourself
and
to
humanity
as
it
is
organized
today
and
all
the
rest
put
in
a
shade
impatiently
i
remember
perfectly
because
i
knew
what
i
was
talking
about
the
doctor
voice
came
across
the
darkness
somewhat
ominously
and
then
he
added
in
a
louder
tone
evidently
sitting
forward
as
he
said
it
for
the
thing
that
has
happened
to
yourself
as
i
foresaw
it
would
had
already
happened
to
me
too
to
you
doctor
too
exclaimed
the
irishman
in
the
moment
pause
that
followed
i
saved
myself
just
in
time
by
getting
rid
of
the
cause
you
discharged
him
from
the
hospital
because
you
were
afraid
he
said
it
sharply
as
though
are
instant
of
the
old
resentment
had
flashed
up
by
way
of
answer
stahl
rose
from
his
chair
and
abruptly
turned
up
the
electric
lamp
upon
the
desk
that
faced
them
across
the
cabin
evidently
he
preferred
the
light
saw
that
his
face
was
white
and
very
grave
he
grasped
for
the
first
time
that
the
man
was
speaking
professionally
the
truth
came
driving
next
behind
it
that
stahl
regarded
him
as
a
patient
please
go
on
doctor
he
said
keenly
on
the
watch
i
deeply
interested
the
wings
of
his
great
dream
still
bore
him
too
far
aloft
for
him
to
feel
more
than
the
merest
passing
annoyance
at
his
discovery
resentment
had
gone
too
sadness
and
disappointment
for
an
instant
touched
him
perhaps
but
momentarily
in
the
end
he
felt
sure
that
stahl
would
stand
at
his
side
completely
won
over
and
convinced
you
had
a
similar
experience
to
my
own
you
say
he
urged
him
i
am
all
eagerness
and
sympathy
to
hear
we
talk
in
the
open
air
the
doctor
answered
and
ringing
the
bell
for
the
steward
to
clear
away
he
drew
his
companion
out
to
the
deserted
decks
they
moved
toward
the
bows
past
the
sleeping
peasants
the
stars
were
mirrored
in
a
glassy
sea
and
toward
the
north
the
hills
of
corsica
stood
faintly
outlined
in
the
sky
it
was
already
long
after
midnight
yes
a
similar
thing
nearly
happened
to
me
he
resumed
as
they
settled
themselves
against
a
coil
of
rope
where
only
the
murmur
of
the
washing
sea
could
reach
them
and
might
have
happened
to
others
too
inmates
of
that
big
were
variously
affected
my
action
tardy
i
must
admit
saved
myself
and
them
and
the
german
then
told
his
story
as
a
man
might
tell
of
his
escape
from
some
grave
disaster
in
the
emphatic
sentences
of
his
native
language
he
told
it
congratulating
himself
all
through
the
russian
had
almost
won
him
over
gained
possession
of
his
heart
and
mind
persuaded
him
but
in
the
end
had
failed
because
the
other
ran
away
it
was
like
hearing
a
man
describe
an
attempt
to
draw
him
into
heaven
then
boast
of
his
escape
his
caution
and
his
judgment
as
he
put
it
saved
him
but
to
the
listening
celt
it
rather
seemed
that
his
compromise
it
was
that
damned
him
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
hard
to
enter
for
stahl
had
possessions
not
of
the
wood
and
metal
order
but
possessions
of
the
brain
and
reason
he
was
too
proud
to
forego
completely
they
kept
him
out
with
increasing
sadness
too
he
heard
it
for
here
he
realized
was
the
mental
attitude
of
an
educated
highly
civilized
man
today
a
representative
type
regarded
by
the
world
as
highest
it
was
this
he
had
to
face
moreover
stahl
was
more
than
merely
educated
he
was
understandingly
sympathetic
meeting
the
great
dream
halfway
seeing
in
it
possibilities
admitting
its
high
beauty
and
even
sometimes
speaking
of
it
with
hope
and
a
touch
of
enthusiasm
its
originator
none
the
less
he
regarded
as
a
reactionary
dreamer
an
unsettling
and
disordered
influence
a
patient
if
not
even
something
worse
stahl
voice
and
manner
were
singular
while
he
told
it
all
revealing
one
moment
the
critical
mind
that
analyzed
and
judged
and
the
next
an
enthusiasm
almost
of
the
mystic
alternately
like
the
man
and
woman
of
those
quaint
old
each
peered
out
and
showed
a
face
the
reins
of
compromise
yet
ever
seeking
to
hold
them
well
in
leash
and
drive
them
together
hardly
it
seems
had
the
strange
russian
been
under
his
care
a
week
before
he
passed
beneath
the
sway
of
his
curious
personality
and
experienced
the
attack
of
singular
emotions
upon
his
heart
and
mind
he
described
at
first
the
man
arrival
telling
it
with
the
calm
and
balanced
phrases
a
doctor
uses
when
speaking
merely
of
a
patient
who
had
stirred
his
interest
he
first
detailed
the
method
of
suggestion
he
had
used
to
revive
the
lapsed
memory
and
its
utter
failure
then
he
passed
on
to
speak
of
him
more
generally
but
briefly
and
condensed
the
man
he
said
was
so
engaging
so
docile
his
personality
altogether
so
attractive
and
mysterious
that
i
took
the
case
myself
instead
of
delegating
it
to
my
assistants
all
efforts
to
trace
his
past
collapsed
it
was
as
if
he
had
drifted
into
that
little
hotel
out
of
the
night
of
time
of
madness
there
was
no
evidence
whatever
the
association
of
ideas
in
his
mind
though
limited
was
logical
and
rigid
his
health
was
perfect
barring
strange
sudden
fever
his
vitality
tremendous
yet
he
ate
most
sparingly
and
the
only
food
he
touched
was
fruit
and
milk
and
vegetables
meat
made
him
sick
the
huge
frame
shuddered
when
he
saw
it
and
from
all
the
human
beings
in
the
place
with
whom
he
came
in
contact
he
shrank
with
a
kind
of
puzzled
dismay
with
animals
most
oddly
it
seemed
he
sought
companionship
he
would
run
to
the
window
if
a
dog
barked
or
to
hear
a
horse
hoofs
a
persian
cat
belonging
to
one
of
the
nurses
never
left
his
side
and
i
have
seen
the
trees
in
the
yard
outside
his
window
thick
with
birds
and
even
found
them
in
the
room
and
on
the
sill
flitting
about
his
very
person
unafraid
and
singing
with
me
as
with
the
attendants
his
speech
was
almost
nil
laconic
words
in
various
languages
clipped
phrases
that
sometimes
combined
russian
french
or
german
other
tongues
as
well
but
strangest
of
all
with
animal
life
he
seemed
to
hold
this
kind
of
communication
that
was
intelligible
both
to
himself
and
them
animals
certainly
were
of
him
it
was
not
speech
it
ran
in
a
deep
continuous
murmur
like
a
droning
humming
sound
of
wind
i
took
the
hint
thus
faintly
offered
i
gave
him
his
freedom
in
the
yards
and
gardens
the
open
air
and
intercourse
with
natural
life
was
what
he
craved
the
sadness
and
the
air
of
puzzled
fretting
then
left
his
face
his
eyes
grew
bright
his
whole
presentment
happier
he
ran
and
laughed
and
even
sang
the
fever
that
had
troubled
him
all
vanished
often
myself
i
took
the
place
of
nurse
or
orderly
to
watch
him
for
the
man
presence
more
than
interested
me
it
gave
me
a
renewed
sense
of
life
that
was
exhilarating
invigorating
delightful
and
in
his
appearance
meanwhile
something
that
was
not
size
or
physical
measurement
turned
tremendous
a
part
of
me
that
was
not
mind
a
sort
of
forgotten
instinct
blindly
groping
came
of
its
own
accord
to
regard
him
as
some
loose
fragment
of
a
natural
cosmic
life
that
had
somehow
blundered
down
into
a
human
organism
it
sought
to
use
and
then
it
was
for
the
first
time
i
recognized
the
spell
he
had
cast
upon
me
for
when
the
committee
decided
there
was
no
reason
to
keep
him
longer
i
urged
that
he
should
stay
making
a
special
plea
i
took
him
as
a
private
patient
of
my
own
i
kept
him
under
closer
personal
observation
than
ever
before
i
needed
him
something
deep
within
me
something
undivined
hitherto
called
out
into
life
by
his
presence
could
not
do
without
him
this
new
craving
breakingly
wild
and
sweet
awoke
in
my
blood
and
cried
for
him
his
presence
nourished
it
in
me
most
insidiously
it
attacked
me
it
stirred
deep
down
among
the
roots
of
my
being
it
my
personality
seems
the
best
way
i
can
put
it
for
turning
a
critical
analysis
upon
it
i
discovered
that
it
was
an
undermining
and
revolutionary
change
going
steadily
forward
in
my
character
its
growth
had
hitherto
been
secret
when
i
first
recognized
its
presence
the
thing
was
already
strong
for
a
long
time
it
had
been
building
and
the
change
in
a
word
you
will
grasp
my
meaning
from
the
shortest
description
of
essentials
was
this
that
ambition
left
me
ordinary
desire
crumbled
the
outer
world
men
value
so
began
to
fade
and
in
their
place
cried
breathlessly
interrupting
for
the
first
time
came
a
rushing
passionate
desire
to
escape
from
cities
and
live
for
beauty
and
simplicity
the
wilderness
to
taste
the
life
seemed
to
know
to
go
out
blindly
with
him
into
woods
and
desolate
places
and
be
mixed
and
blended
with
the
loveliness
of
earth
and
nature
this
was
the
first
thing
i
knew
it
was
like
an
expansion
of
my
normal
world
almost
an
extension
of
consciousness
it
somehow
threatened
my
sense
of
personal
identity
and
it
made
me
hesitate
caught
the
tremor
in
his
voice
even
in
the
telling
of
it
the
passion
plucked
at
him
for
here
as
ever
he
stood
on
the
of
compromise
his
heart
tempting
him
toward
salvation
his
brain
and
reason
tugging
at
the
brakes
the
sham
and
emptiness
or
modern
life
its
drab
vulgarity
the
unworthiness
of
its
very
ideals
stood
appallingly
revealed
before
some
inner
eye
just
opening
i
felt
shaken
to
the
core
of
what
had
seemed
hitherto
my
very
solid
and
estimable
self
how
the
man
thus
so
powerfully
affected
me
lies
beyond
all
intelligible
explanation
to
use
the
obvious
catchword
is
to
use
a
toy
and
stop
a
leak
with
paper
for
his
influence
was
exerted
he
cast
no
net
of
clever
persuasive
words
about
my
thought
out
of
that
deep
strange
silence
of
the
man
it
somehow
came
his
actions
and
his
simple
happiness
of
face
and
manner
both
in
some
sense
the
raw
material
of
speech
perhaps
may
have
operated
as
potently
suggestive
agents
but
no
adequate
causes
to
justify
the
result
apart
from
the
fantastic
theories
i
have
mentioned
have
ever
yet
come
within
the
range
of
my
understanding
i
can
only
give
you
the
undeniable
effects
your
sense
of
extended
consciousness
asked
his
listener
was
this
continuous
once
it
had
begun
it
came
in
patches
stahl
continued
my
normal
everyday
self
was
thus
able
to
check
it
while
it
derided
commiserated
this
everyday
self
the
latter
stood
in
dread
of
it
and
even
awe
my
training
you
see
regarded
it
as
symptom
of
disorder
a
beginning
of
unbalance
that
might
end
in
insanity
the
thin
wedge
of
a
dissociation
of
the
personality
morton
prince
and
others
have
described
his
speech
grew
more
and
more
jerky
even
incoherent
evidently
the
material
had
not
even
now
been
fully
reduced
to
order
in
his
mind
among
other
curious
symptoms
i
soon
established
that
this
subtle
spreading
of
my
consciousness
grew
upon
me
especially
during
sleep
the
business
of
the
day
distracted
scattered
it
on
waking
in
the
morning
as
with
the
physical
fatigue
that
comes
toward
the
closing
of
the
day
it
was
strongest
and
so
in
order
to
examine
it
closely
when
in
fullest
manifestation
i
came
to
spend
the
nights
with
him
i
would
creep
in
while
he
slept
and
stay
till
morning
alternately
sleeping
and
waking
myself
i
watched
the
two
of
us
together
i
also
watched
the
in
me
and
thus
it
was
i
made
the
further
strange
discovery
that
the
influence
exerted
on
me
was
strongest
while
he
slept
it
is
best
described
by
saying
that
in
his
sleep
i
was
conscious
that
he
sought
to
draw
me
with
him
away
somewhere
into
his
own
wonderful
world
the
state
or
region
that
is
where
he
manifested
completely
instead
of
partially
as
i
knew
him
here
his
personality
was
a
channel
somewhere
out
into
a
living
conscious
nature
only
interrupted
you
felt
that
to
yield
and
go
involved
some
nameless
inner
catastrophe
and
so
resisted
he
chose
his
phrase
with
purpose
because
i
discovered
was
the
pregnant
answer
given
steadily
while
he
watched
his
listener
closely
through
the
darkness
that
this
desire
for
escape
the
man
had
wakened
in
me
was
nothing
more
or
less
than
the
desire
to
leave
the
world
to
leave
the
conditions
that
prevented
in
fact
to
leave
the
body
my
discontent
with
modern
life
had
gone
as
far
as
that
it
was
the
birth
of
the
suicidal
mania
the
pause
that
followed
the
words
on
the
part
of
stahl
at
any
rate
was
intentional
held
his
peace
the
men
shifted
their
places
oil
the
coil
of
rope
for
both
were
cramped
and
stiff
with
the
lengthy
session
for
a
minute
or
two
they
leaned
over
the
bulwarks
and
watched
the
phosphorescent
foam
in
silence
the
blue
mountainous
shores
slipped
past
in
shadowy
line
against
the
stars
but
when
they
sat
down
again
their
relative
positions
were
not
what
they
had
been
before
stahl
had
placed
himself
between
his
listener
and
the
sea
and
did
not
let
the
manoeuvre
escape
him
smiling
to
himself
he
noticed
it
just
as
surely
he
noticed
too
that
the
whole
recital
was
being
told
him
with
a
purpose
you
really
need
not
be
afraid
he
could
not
resist
saying
the
idea
of
escape
way
has
never
even
come
to
me
at
all
and
anyhow
far
too
much
on
hand
first
in
telling
the
world
my
message
he
laughed
in
the
silence
that
took
his
words
for
stahl
said
nothing
and
made
as
though
he
had
not
heard
but
the
irishman
understood
that
it
was
in
the
spirit
of
feeble
compromise
that
danger
lay
if
danger
there
was
at
all
and
he
himself
was
far
beyond
such
weakness
his
eye
was
single
and
his
body
full
of
light
and
the
faith
that
plays
with
mountains
had
made
him
whole
return
to
nature
for
him
involved
no
denial
of
human
life
nor
depreciation
of
human
interests
but
only
a
revolutionary
shifting
of
values
and
it
was
one
night
while
he
slept
and
i
watched
him
in
the
little
room
resumed
the
german
as
though
there
had
been
no
interruption
i
noticed
first
so
decisively
this
growing
of
a
singular
size
about
him
i
have
already
mentioned
and
grasped
its
meaning
for
the
bulk
of
the
man
while
growing
emerging
rather
i
should
say
assumed
another
shape
than
his
own
it
was
not
my
eyes
that
saw
it
i
saw
him
as
felt
himself
to
the
creature
personality
his
essential
inner
being
was
acting
directly
upon
my
own
his
influence
was
at
me
from
another
point
or
angle
first
the
emotions
then
the
senses
you
see
it
was
a
finely
organized
attack
i
definitely
understood
at
last
that
my
mind
was
affected
and
proved
it
too
for
the
instant
effort
i
made
at
recovery
resulted
in
my
seeing
him
normal
again
the
size
and
shape
retreated
the
moment
i
denied
them
noticed
how
the
speaker
voice
lingered
over
the
phrase
again
he
knew
the
intention
of
the
pause
that
followed
he
held
his
peace
however
and
waited
nor
was
sight
the
only
sense
affected
stahl
continued
for
smell
and
hearing
also
brought
their
testimony
through
all
but
touch
indeed
the
hallucination
attacked
me
for
sometimes
at
night
while
i
sat
up
watching
in
the
little
room
there
rose
outside
the
open
window
in
the
yards
and
gardens
a
sound
of
tramping
a
distant
roaring
as
of
voices
in
a
rising
wind
a
rushing
hollow
murmur
confused
and
deep
like
that
of
forests
or
the
swift
passage
of
a
host
of
big
birds
across
the
sky
i
heard
it
both
in
the
air
and
on
the
ground
this
tramping
on
the
lawns
this
curious
shaking
of
the
atmosphere
and
with
it
at
the
same
time
a
sharp
and
mingled
perfume
that
made
me
think
of
earth
and
leaves
of
flowers
after
rain
of
plains
and
open
spaces
most
singular
of
all
of
animals
and
horses
before
the
firm
denial
of
my
mind
they
vanished
just
as
the
change
of
form
had
vanished
but
both
left
me
weaker
than
they
found
me
more
tender
to
attack
moreover
i
understood
most
plainly
that
they
emanated
all
from
him
these
came
too
chiefly
as
i
mentioned
whilst
he
slept
in
sleep
it
seemed
he
set
them
free
the
slumber
of
the
body
disengaged
them
and
then
the
instinct
came
to
warn
me
presenting
itself
with
the
authority
of
an
unanswerable
intuition
the
realization
namely
that
if
for
a
single
moment
in
his
presence
i
slept
the
changes
would
leap
forward
in
my
own
being
and
i
should
join
him
escape
know
freedom
in
a
larger
consciousness
cried
the
other
and
for
a
man
of
my
point
of
view
and
training
to
have
permitted
such
a
conviction
at
all
he
went
on
the
interruption
utterly
ignored
again
proves
how
far
along
the
road
i
had
already
traveled
without
knowing
it
only
at
the
time
i
was
not
aware
of
this
it
was
the
shock
of
full
discovery
later
that
brought
me
to
my
senses
when
seeking
to
withdraw
i
found
i
could
not
and
so
you
ran
away
it
came
out
bluntly
enough
with
a
touch
of
scorn
but
ill
concealed
we
discharged
him
but
before
that
came
there
was
more
i
have
to
tell
you
if
you
still
care
to
hear
it
i
not
tired
if
that
what
you
mean
i
could
listen
all
night
as
far
as
that
goes
he
rose
to
stretch
his
legs
a
moment
and
stahl
rose
too
instantly
together
they
leaned
over
the
bulwarks
the
german
hat
was
off
and
the
air
made
by
the
steamer
passage
drew
his
beard
out
the
warm
soft
wind
brought
odors
of
sea
and
shore
it
caressed
their
faces
then
passed
on
across
those
sleeping
peasants
on
the
lower
deck
the
masts
and
rigging
swung
steadily
against
the
host
of
stars
before
i
thus
knew
myself
half
caught
continued
the
doctor
standing
now
close
enough
beside
him
for
actual
contact
and
found
it
difficult
to
get
away
other
things
had
happened
things
that
confirmed
the
change
so
singularly
begun
in
me
they
happened
everywhere
confirmation
came
from
many
quarters
though
slight
enough
they
filled
in
all
the
gaps
and
crevices
strengthened
the
joints
and
built
the
huge
illusion
round
me
all
complete
until
it
held
me
like
a
prison
and
they
are
difficult
to
tell
only
indeed
to
yourself
who
underwent
a
similar
experience
up
there
in
the
mountains
could
they
bring
much
meaning
you
had
the
same
temptation
and
you
weathered
the
same
storm
he
caught
arm
a
moment
and
held
it
you
escaped
this
madness
just
as
i
did
and
you
will
realize
what
i
mean
when
i
say
that
the
sensation
of
losing
my
sense
of
personal
identity
became
so
dangerously
so
seductively
strong
the
feeling
of
extended
consciousness
became
delicious
too
delicious
to
resist
a
kind
of
pagan
joy
and
exultation
known
to
some
in
early
youth
but
put
away
with
the
things
of
youth
possessed
me
in
the
presence
of
this
other
soul
so
strangely
powerful
in
its
silence
and
simplicity
i
felt
as
though
i
touched
new
sources
of
life
i
tapped
them
they
poured
down
and
flooded
me
with
dreams
dreams
that
could
really
haunt
with
unsettling
thoughts
of
glory
and
delight
the
i
got
clean
away
into
nature
i
felt
as
though
some
portion
of
me
just
awakening
reached
out
across
him
into
rain
and
sunshine
far
up
into
the
sweet
and
starry
sky
as
a
tree
growing
out
of
a
thicket
that
chokes
its
lower
part
finds
light
and
freedom
at
the
top
it
caught
you
badly
doctor
murmured
the
gods
came
close
so
badly
that
i
loathed
the
prisoned
darkness
that
held
me
so
thickly
in
the
body
i
longed
to
know
my
being
all
dispersed
through
nature
scattered
with
dew
and
wind
shining
with
the
and
the
sun
and
the
manner
of
escape
i
hinted
to
you
a
little
while
ago
came
to
seem
right
and
necessary
lawful
it
seemed
and
obvious
the
mania
literally
obsessed
me
though
still
i
tried
to
hide
it
even
from
myself
and
struggled
in
resistance
you
spoke
just
now
of
other
things
that
came
to
confirm
it
the
irishman
said
while
the
other
paused
to
take
breath
all
this
he
knew
he
grew
weary
of
stahl
clever
laboring
the
point
that
it
was
madness
a
little
knowledge
is
ever
dangerous
and
he
saw
so
clearly
why
the
hesitation
of
the
merely
intellectual
man
had
led
him
into
error
did
you
mean
that
others
acknowledged
this
influence
as
well
as
yourself
you
shall
read
that
for
yourself
tomorrow
came
the
answer
in
the
detailed
report
i
drew
up
afterwards
it
is
far
too
long
to
tell
you
now
but
i
may
mention
something
of
it
that
breaking
out
of
patients
was
a
curious
thing
their
trying
to
escape
their
dreams
and
singing
their
efforts
sometimes
to
approach
his
room
their
longing
for
the
open
and
the
gardens
the
deep
prolonged
entrancing
of
a
few
the
sounds
of
rushing
tramping
that
they
too
heard
the
violence
of
some
the
silent
ecstasy
of
others
the
thing
may
find
its
parallel
perhaps
in
the
collective
mania
that
sometimes
afflicts
religious
communities
in
monasteries
or
convents
only
here
there
was
no
preacher
and
eloquent
leader
to
induce
hysteria
nothing
but
that
silent
dynamo
of
power
gentle
and
winning
as
a
little
child
a
being
who
could
not
put
a
phrase
together
exerting
his
potent
spell
unconsciously
and
chiefly
while
he
slept
for
the
phenomena
almost
without
exception
came
in
the
night
and
often
at
their
fullest
strength
as
afterwards
reported
to
me
while
i
dozed
in
his
room
and
watched
beside
his
motionless
and
slumbering
form
oh
and
there
was
more
as
well
much
more
as
you
shall
read
the
stories
my
assistants
brought
me
the
tales
of
frightened
nurse
and
warder
the
amazing
yarns
the
porter
stammered
out
of
strangers
who
had
rung
the
bell
at
dawn
trying
to
push
past
him
through
the
door
saying
they
were
messengers
and
had
been
summoned
sent
for
had
to
come
large
curious
windy
figures
or
as
he
sometimes
called
them
with
unconscious
humor
creatures
out
of
fairy
books
or
circuses
that
always
vanished
as
suddenly
as
they
came
making
every
allowance
for
excitement
and
exaggeration
the
tales
were
strange
enough
i
can
assure
you
and
the
way
many
of
the
patients
knew
their
visions
intensified
their
illusions
doubly
strengthened
their
efforts
even
to
destroy
themselves
in
many
cases
almost
more
than
the
staff
could
deal
with
all
this
brought
the
matter
to
a
climax
and
made
my
duty
very
plain
at
last
and
the
effect
upon
yourself
at
its
worst
asked
his
listener
quietly
stahl
sighed
wearily
a
little
as
he
answered
with
a
sadness
in
his
tone
i
told
you
briefly
that
he
said
repetition
can
not
strengthen
it
the
worthlessness
of
the
majority
of
human
aims
today
expresses
it
best
what
you
have
called
yourself
the
of
civilization
the
vanity
of
all
life
modern
tendencies
for
outer
mechanical
developments
a
wild
mad
beauty
streaming
from
that
personality
overran
the
whole
place
and
caught
the
lot
of
us
myself
especially
with
a
lust
for
simple
natural
things
and
with
a
passion
for
spiritual
beauty
to
accompany
them
fame
wealth
position
seemed
the
shadows
then
and
something
else
it
hard
to
name
announced
itself
as
the
substance
i
wanted
to
clear
out
and
live
with
nature
to
know
simplicity
unselfish
purposes
a
golden
state
of
childlike
existence
close
to
dawns
and
dew
and
running
water
cared
for
by
woods
and
blessed
by
all
the
winds
he
paused
again
for
breath
then
added
and
that
just
where
the
mania
caught
at
me
so
cunningly
till
i
saw
it
and
called
a
halt
ah
for
the
thing
i
sought
the
thing
knew
and
perhaps
remembered
was
not
possible
the
it
was
a
spiritual
state
or
to
be
known
subjectively
checked
him
i
am
no
by
nature
he
went
on
with
energy
and
so
i
fought
and
conquered
it
but
first
i
tell
you
it
came
upon
me
like
a
tempest
a
hurricane
of
wonder
and
delight
i
always
held
like
yourself
perhaps
that
civilization
brings
its
own
army
of
diseases
and
that
the
few
illnesses
known
to
ruder
savage
races
can
be
cured
by
simple
means
the
earth
herself
supplies
and
along
this
line
of
thought
the
thing
swept
into
me
the
line
of
my
own
this
was
natural
enough
natural
enough
too
that
it
thus
at
first
deceived
me
for
the
quack
cures
of
history
come
to
this
herb
simples
and
the
rest
only
we
know
them
now
as
cure
old
kneipp
and
a
hundred
others
doctors
have
never
swarmed
before
as
they
do
now
and
these
artificial
diseases
civilization
brings
in
such
quantity
seemed
all
at
once
to
mean
the
abeyance
of
some
central
life
or
power
men
ought
to
share
with
nature
you
shall
read
it
all
in
my
written
report
i
merely
wish
to
show
you
now
how
the
insidious
thing
got
at
me
along
the
line
of
my
special
knowledge
i
saw
the
truth
that
priests
and
doctors
are
the
only
possible
and
necessary
in
the
world
and
that
they
should
be
really
but
a
single
profession
xliv
he
drew
suddenly
back
with
a
kind
of
jerk
it
was
as
though
he
realized
abruptly
that
he
had
said
too
much
had
overdone
it
he
took
his
companion
by
the
arm
and
led
him
down
the
decks
as
they
passed
the
bridge
the
captain
called
out
a
word
of
welcome
to
them
and
his
jolly
boisterous
laugh
ran
down
the
wind
the
american
engineer
came
from
behind
a
dark
corner
almost
running
into
them
his
face
was
flushed
it
like
a
furnace
below
he
said
in
his
nasal
familiar
manner
too
hot
to
sleep
i
run
up
for
a
gulp
of
air
he
made
as
though
he
would
join
them
the
wind
behind
us
yes
replied
the
doctor
in
a
different
tone
and
there
no
draught
with
a
gesture
half
bow
half
dismissal
he
made
even
this
member
of
the
greatest
civilization
on
earth
understand
he
was
not
wanted
and
they
turned
at
the
cabin
door
a
moment
wondering
at
the
admirable
dignity
with
which
the
little
man
had
managed
the
polite
dismissal
himself
perhaps
he
would
not
have
minded
the
diversion
he
was
a
little
weary
of
the
german
long
recital
the
confession
had
not
been
complete
he
felt
much
had
been
held
back
it
was
not
altogether
straightforward
the
dishonesty
which
hides
in
compromise
peeped
through
it
everywhere
and
the
incoherence
of
the
latter
part
had
almost
bored
him
for
it
was
he
easily
divined
a
studied
incoherence
it
was
meant
to
touch
a
similar
weakness
in
himself
if
there
but
it
was
there
he
saw
through
the
whole
manoeuvre
stahl
wished
to
warn
and
save
him
by
showing
that
the
experience
they
had
partly
shared
was
nothing
but
a
strange
mental
disorder
he
wished
to
force
in
this
subtle
way
his
own
interpretation
of
it
upon
his
friend
yet
at
the
same
time
the
intuitive
irishman
discerned
that
other
tendency
in
the
man
which
would
so
gladly
perhaps
have
welcomed
a
different
explanation
and
even
in
some
fashion
did
actually
accept
it
smiled
inwardly
as
he
watched
him
prepare
the
coffee
as
of
old
and
patiently
he
waited
for
the
rest
that
was
to
come
in
a
certain
sense
it
all
was
useful
it
would
be
helpful
later
this
was
an
attitude
he
would
often
have
to
face
when
he
returned
to
civilized
life
and
tried
to
tell
his
message
to
the
thinking
educated
men
of
today
the
men
he
must
win
over
somehow
to
his
dream
the
men
without
whose
backing
no
movement
could
hope
to
meet
with
even
a
measure
of
success
so
like
myself
said
stahl
as
he
carefully
tended
the
flame
of
the
between
them
you
have
escaped
by
the
skin
of
your
teeth
as
it
were
and
i
congratulate
you
heartily
i
thank
you
said
the
other
dryly
you
write
your
version
now
and
i
write
mine
indeed
it
is
already
almost
finished
then
we
compare
notes
perhaps
we
might
even
publish
them
together
he
poured
out
the
fragrant
coffee
they
faced
each
other
across
the
little
table
but
did
not
take
the
bait
he
wished
to
hear
the
balance
his
companion
still
might
tell
and
presently
he
asked
for
it
with
the
discharge
of
your
patient
the
trouble
ceased
at
once
then
comparatively
soon
it
gradually
subsided
yes
and
as
regards
yourself
i
came
back
to
my
senses
i
recovered
my
control
the
insubordinate
impulses
i
had
known
retired
he
smiled
as
he
sipped
his
coffee
you
see
me
now
he
added
looking
his
companion
steadily
in
the
eyes
a
sane
and
commonplace
ship
doctor
i
congratulate
you
he
bowed
on
what
you
missed
yet
almost
accomplished
the
other
finished
you
might
have
known
like
me
the
cosmic
consciousness
you
might
have
met
the
gods
in
a
the
doctor
added
with
a
snap
they
laughed
at
one
another
across
their
coffee
cups
as
once
before
they
had
laughed
across
their
glasses
of
kakhetian
wine
two
eternally
antagonistic
types
that
will
exist
as
long
as
life
itself
but
contrary
to
his
expectations
the
german
had
little
more
to
tell
he
mentioned
how
the
experience
had
led
his
mind
into
strange
and
novel
reading
in
his
desire
to
know
what
other
minds
might
have
to
offer
by
way
of
explanation
even
the
most
fanciful
and
he
told
though
very
briefly
how
he
had
picked
up
fechner
among
others
and
carefully
studied
his
poetic
theories
and
read
besides
the
best
accounts
of
spiritistic
phenomena
as
also
of
the
rarer
states
of
hysteria
multiple
personality
and
even
those
looser
theories
which
suggest
that
a
portion
of
the
human
constitution
called
astral
or
etheric
may
escape
from
the
parent
center
and
carrying
with
it
the
subtler
forces
of
desire
and
yearning
construct
a
vivid
subjective
state
of
mind
which
is
practically
its
heaven
of
hope
and
longing
all
fulfilled
he
did
not
however
betray
the
results
upon
himself
of
all
this
curious
reading
and
study
nor
mention
what
he
found
of
truth
or
probability
in
it
all
he
merely
quoted
books
and
authors
in
at
least
three
languages
that
stretched
in
a
singular
and
catholic
array
from
plato
and
the
across
the
ages
to
myers
du
prel
flournoy
lodge
and
morton
prince
out
of
the
lot
perhaps
gathered
it
by
inference
rather
than
from
actual
statement
from
fragments
of
their
talks
upon
the
outward
voyage
more
than
from
anything
let
fall
just
then
fechner
had
proved
the
most
persuasive
to
this
man
contradictory
and
original
mind
it
certainly
seemed
at
least
as
if
he
knew
some
secret
sympathetic
leaning
toward
the
idea
that
consciousness
and
matter
were
inseparable
and
that
a
cosmic
consciousness
of
sorts
might
pertain
to
the
earth
as
equally
to
all
the
other
stars
and
planets
the
idea
he
so
often
referred
to
had
seized
a
part
of
his
imagination
that
at
least
was
clear
the
irishman
drank
it
all
in
but
he
was
too
exhausted
now
to
argue
and
too
full
besides
to
ask
questions
his
natural
volubility
forsook
him
he
let
the
doctor
have
his
say
without
interruptions
he
took
the
warnings
with
the
rest
of
it
nothing
the
other
said
had
changed
him
it
was
not
the
first
sunrise
they
had
watched
together
and
as
they
took
the
morning
air
on
deck
once
more
corsica
rising
like
a
dream
the
night
had
left
behind
her
on
the
sea
he
listened
with
fainter
interest
to
the
german
concluding
sentences
at
any
rate
you
now
understand
why
on
that
other
voyage
i
was
so
eager
to
watch
you
with
your
friend
so
keen
to
separate
you
to
prevent
your
sleeping
with
him
and
at
the
same
time
so
desirous
to
see
his
influence
upon
you
at
close
quarters
and
also
why
i
always
understood
so
well
what
was
going
on
both
outwardly
and
within
quietly
reiterated
the
belief
he
still
held
in
the
power
of
his
own
dream
i
shall
go
home
and
give
my
message
to
the
world
was
what
he
said
quietly
i
think
it
true
it
better
to
keep
silent
was
the
answer
for
even
if
true
the
world
is
not
ready
yet
to
listen
it
will
evaporate
you
find
in
the
telling
you
find
there
nothing
to
tell
besides
a
dream
like
yours
must
dawn
on
all
at
once
and
not
on
merely
one
no
one
will
understand
you
i
can
but
try
you
will
reach
no
men
of
action
and
few
of
intellect
you
will
merely
stuff
the
dreamers
who
are
already
stuffed
enough
what
is
the
use
i
ask
you
what
is
the
use
it
will
set
the
world
on
fire
for
simplicity
the
other
murmured
knowing
the
great
sweet
passion
flame
within
him
as
he
watched
the
sun
come
slowly
out
of
the
rosy
sea
all
the
use
in
the
world
none
was
the
laconic
answer
they
might
know
the
gods
cried
using
the
phrase
that
symbolized
for
him
the
entire
vision
stahl
looked
at
him
for
some
time
before
he
spoke
again
that
expression
of
wistful
almost
longing
admiration
shone
in
the
brown
eyes
my
friend
he
answered
gravely
men
do
not
want
to
know
the
gods
they
prefer
their
delights
less
subtle
they
crave
the
cruder
physical
sensations
that
bang
them
toward
excitement
of
disease
of
pain
of
separateness
put
in
the
other
the
german
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
the
stage
they
at
he
said
you
if
you
have
success
will
merely
make
a
few
uncomfortable
the
majority
will
hardly
turn
their
heads
to
one
in
a
million
you
may
bring
peace
and
happiness
it
worth
it
cried
the
irishman
even
for
that
one
stahl
answered
very
gently
smiling
with
his
new
expression
of
tenderness
and
sympathy
dream
your
great
dream
if
you
will
but
dream
it
my
friend
alone
in
peace
and
silence
that
i
speak
of
is
yourself
the
doctor
pressed
his
hand
and
turned
toward
his
cabin
stood
a
little
longer
to
share
the
sunrise
neither
spoke
another
word
he
heard
the
door
shut
softly
behind
him
the
unspoken
answer
in
his
mind
was
in
two
words
two
common
little
adjectives
coward
and
selfish
but
stahl
once
in
the
privacy
of
his
cabin
judging
by
the
glance
visible
on
his
face
ere
he
closed
the
door
may
probably
have
known
a
very
different
thought
and
possibly
he
uttered
it
below
his
breath
a
sigh
most
certainly
escaped
his
lips
a
sigh
half
sadness
half
relief
for
remembered
it
afterwards
beautiful
foolish
dreamer
among
men
but
thank
god
harmless
to
others
and
himself
and
soon
afterwards
also
went
to
his
cabin
before
sleep
took
him
he
lay
deep
in
a
mood
of
sadness
almost
as
though
he
had
heard
his
friend
unspoken
thought
he
realized
the
insuperable
difficulties
that
lay
before
him
the
world
would
think
him
mad
but
harmless
then
with
full
sleep
he
slipped
across
that
sunrise
and
found
the
garden
he
held
the
eternal
password
i
can
but
try
xlv
and
here
the
crowded
muddled
notebooks
come
to
an
end
the
rest
was
action
and
inevitable
disaster
the
brief
history
of
mad
campaign
may
be
imagined
to
a
writer
who
found
interest
in
the
study
of
forlorn
hopes
and
their
leaders
a
detailed
record
of
this
particular
one
might
seem
worth
while
for
me
personally
it
is
too
sad
and
too
pathetic
i
can
not
bring
myself
to
tell
much
less
to
analyze
the
story
of
a
broken
heart
when
that
heart
and
story
are
those
of
a
close
and
deeply
admired
intimate
a
man
who
gave
me
genuine
love
and
held
my
own
besides
although
a
curious
chapter
in
uncommon
human
nature
it
is
not
by
any
means
a
new
one
it
is
the
true
story
of
many
a
poet
and
dreamer
since
the
world
began
though
perhaps
not
often
told
nor
even
guessed
and
only
the
poets
themselves
especially
the
little
poets
who
can
not
utter
half
the
fire
that
consumes
them
may
know
the
searing
pain
and
passion
and
the
true
inwardness
of
it
all
most
of
those
months
it
chanced
i
was
away
and
only
fragments
of
the
foolish
enterprise
could
reach
me
but
nothing
i
think
could
have
stopped
him
nor
any
worldly
selfish
wisdom
made
him
even
pause
the
thing
possessed
him
utterly
it
had
to
flame
its
way
out
as
best
it
could
to
high
and
low
he
preached
by
every
means
in
his
power
the
simple
life
he
preached
the
mystical
life
as
well
that
the
true
knowledge
and
the
true
progress
are
within
that
they
both
pertain
to
the
inner
being
and
have
no
chief
concern
with
external
things
he
preached
it
wildly
lopsidedly
in
or
out
of
season
knowing
no
half
measures
his
enthusiasm
obscured
his
sense
of
proportion
and
the
extravagance
hid
the
germ
of
truth
that
undeniably
lay
in
his
message
to
put
the
movement
on
its
feet
at
first
he
realized
every
possession
that
he
had
it
left
him
penniless
if
he
was
not
almost
so
already
and
in
the
end
it
left
him
smothered
beneath
the
glory
of
his
blinding
and
unutterable
dream
he
never
understood
that
suggestion
is
more
effective
than
a
his
faith
was
no
mere
little
seed
of
mustard
but
a
forest
singing
its
message
in
a
wind
of
thunder
he
shouted
it
aloud
to
the
world
i
think
the
acid
disappointment
that
lies
beneath
that
trite
old
phrase
a
broken
heart
was
never
really
his
for
indeed
it
seemed
that
his
cruel
ludicrous
failure
merely
served
to
strengthen
hope
and
purpose
by
making
him
seek
for
a
better
method
of
imparting
what
he
had
to
say
in
the
end
he
learned
the
bitter
lesson
to
the
full
but
faith
never
trailed
a
single
feather
those
jeering
audiences
in
the
park
those
empty
benches
in
many
a
public
hall
those
brief
ignoring
paragraphs
in
the
few
newspapers
that
filled
a
vacant
corner
by
labeling
him
crank
and
prophet
even
the
silence
that
greeted
his
pamphlets
his
letters
to
the
press
and
all
the
rest
hurt
him
for
others
rather
than
for
himself
his
pain
was
altruistic
never
personal
his
dream
and
motive
his
huge
unwieldy
compassion
his
genuine
love
for
humanity
all
were
big
enough
for
that
and
so
i
think
he
missed
the
personal
mortification
that
disappointment
so
deep
might
bring
to
dreamers
with
an
aim
less
unadulteratedly
pure
his
eye
was
single
to
the
end
he
attributed
only
the
highest
motives
to
all
who
offered
help
the
very
quacks
and
fools
who
flocked
to
his
banner
eager
to
exploit
their
smaller
fads
by
joining
them
to
his
own
he
welcomed
only
regretting
that
as
stahl
had
warned
him
he
could
not
attract
a
better
class
of
mind
he
did
not
even
see
through
the
manoeuvres
of
the
occasional
women
of
wealth
and
title
who
sought
to
conceal
their
own
mediocrity
by
advertising
in
their
the
eccentricities
of
men
like
himself
and
to
the
end
he
had
the
courage
of
his
glorious
convictions
the
change
of
method
that
he
learned
at
last
moreover
was
characteristic
of
this
faith
and
courage
i
begun
at
the
wrong
end
he
said
i
shall
never
reach
men
through
their
intellects
their
brains
today
are
occupied
by
the
gods
of
civilization
i
can
not
change
the
direction
of
their
thoughts
and
lusts
from
outside
the
momentum
is
too
great
to
stop
that
way
i
must
get
at
them
from
within
to
reach
their
hearts
the
new
ideas
must
rise
up
i
see
the
truer
way
i
must
do
it
the
other
it
must
come
to
them
in
beauty
for
he
was
to
the
last
convinced
that
death
would
merge
him
in
the
being
of
the
earth
collective
consciousness
and
that
lost
in
her
deep
eternal
beauty
he
thus
might
reach
the
hearts
of
men
in
some
stray
glimpse
of
nature
loveliness
and
register
his
flaming
message
he
loved
to
quote
from
adonais
he
is
made
one
with
nature
there
is
heard
his
voice
in
all
her
music
from
the
moan
of
thunder
to
the
song
of
night
sweet
bird
he
is
a
presence
to
be
felt
and
known
in
darkness
and
in
light
from
herb
and
stone
spreading
itself
that
power
may
move
which
has
withdrawn
his
being
to
its
own
he
is
a
portion
of
the
loveliness
which
once
he
made
more
lovely
he
doth
bear
his
part
while
the
one
spirit
plastic
stress
sweeps
through
the
dull
dense
world
and
this
thought
phrased
in
a
dozen
different
ways
was
always
on
his
lips
to
dream
was
right
and
useful
even
to
dream
alone
because
the
beauty
of
the
dream
must
add
to
the
beauty
of
the
whole
of
which
it
is
a
part
and
an
interpretation
it
was
not
really
lost
or
vain
all
must
come
back
in
time
to
feed
the
world
he
had
known
gracious
thoughts
of
earth
too
big
to
utter
almost
too
big
to
hold
such
thoughts
could
not
ever
be
really
told
they
were
incommunicable
for
the
mystical
revelation
is
incommunicable
it
has
authority
only
for
him
who
feels
it
a
corporate
revelation
is
impossible
only
those
among
men
could
know
in
whose
hearts
it
rose
intuitively
and
made
its
presence
felt
as
innate
ideas
inspiration
brings
it
and
beauty
is
the
vehicle
their
hearts
must
change
before
their
minds
could
be
reached
i
can
work
it
better
from
the
other
side
from
that
old
old
garden
which
is
the
mother
heart
in
this
way
i
can
help
at
any
rate
xlvi
it
was
at
the
close
of
a
wet
and
foggy
autumn
that
we
met
again
winter
in
the
air
all
london
desolate
and
his
wasted
forlorn
appearance
told
me
the
truth
at
once
only
the
passionate
eagerness
of
voice
and
manner
were
there
to
prove
that
the
spirit
had
not
weakened
there
glowed
within
a
fire
that
showed
itself
in
the
translucent
shining
of
the
eyes
and
face
i
made
one
great
discovery
old
man
he
exclaimed
with
old
familiar
high
enthusiasm
one
great
discovery
at
least
you
made
so
many
i
answered
cheerfully
while
my
real
thoughts
were
busy
with
his
bodily
state
of
health
for
his
appearance
shocked
me
he
stood
among
a
litter
of
papers
books
neckties
nailed
boots
knapsacks
maps
and
that
rolled
upon
the
floor
from
the
mouth
of
the
willesden
canvas
sack
his
old
grey
flannel
suit
hung
literally
upon
a
bag
of
bones
all
the
life
there
was
seemed
concentrated
in
his
face
and
eyes
those
light
blue
eyes
they
were
darker
than
usual
now
eyes
like
the
sea
i
thought
his
hair
long
and
disordered
tumbled
over
his
forehead
he
was
pale
and
at
the
same
time
flushed
it
was
almost
a
disembodied
spirit
that
i
saw
you
made
so
many
i
love
to
hear
them
is
this
one
finer
than
the
others
he
looked
a
moment
at
me
through
and
through
almost
uncannily
he
looked
in
reality
beyond
me
it
was
something
else
he
saw
and
in
the
dusk
i
turned
involuntarily
simpler
he
said
quickly
much
simpler
he
moved
up
close
beside
me
whispering
was
it
all
imagination
that
a
breath
of
flowers
came
with
him
there
was
certainly
a
curious
fragrance
in
the
air
wild
and
sweet
like
orchards
in
the
spring
and
it
is
that
the
garden
you
need
go
to
the
distant
caucasus
to
find
it
it
all
about
this
old
london
town
and
in
these
foggy
streets
and
dingy
pavements
it
even
in
this
cramped
undusted
room
now
at
this
moment
while
that
lamp
flickers
and
the
thousands
go
to
sleep
the
gates
of
horn
and
ivory
are
here
he
tapped
his
breast
and
here
the
flowers
the
long
clean
open
hills
the
giant
herd
the
nymphs
the
sunshine
and
the
gods
so
attached
was
he
now
to
that
little
room
in
paddington
where
his
books
and
papers
lay
that
when
the
curious
illness
that
had
caught
him
grew
so
much
worse
and
the
attacks
of
the
nameless
fever
that
afflicted
him
turned
serious
i
hired
a
bedroom
for
him
in
the
same
house
and
it
was
in
that
poky
den
he
breathed
his
last
his
illness
i
called
curious
his
fever
nameless
because
they
really
were
so
and
puzzled
every
one
he
simply
faded
out
of
life
it
seemed
there
was
no
pain
no
sleeplessness
no
suffering
of
any
physical
kind
he
uttered
no
complaint
nor
were
there
symptoms
of
any
known
disorder
your
friend
is
sound
organically
the
doctor
told
me
when
i
pressed
him
for
the
truth
there
on
the
stairs
sound
as
a
bell
he
wants
the
open
air
and
plenty
of
wholesome
food
that
all
his
body
is
his
trouble
is
mental
some
deep
and
heavy
disappointment
doubtless
if
you
can
change
the
current
of
his
thoughts
awaken
interest
in
common
things
and
give
him
change
of
scene
perhaps
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
looked
very
grave
you
think
he
dying
i
think
yes
he
is
dying
from
from
lack
of
living
pure
and
simple
was
the
answer
he
has
lost
all
hold
on
life
he
has
abundant
vitality
still
full
of
it
but
it
all
goes
elsewhere
the
physical
organism
gets
none
of
it
yet
mentally
i
asked
there
nothing
actually
wrong
not
in
the
ordinary
sense
the
mind
is
clear
and
active
so
far
as
i
can
test
it
the
process
of
thought
is
healthy
and
undamaged
it
seems
to
me
he
hesitated
a
moment
on
the
doorstep
while
the
driver
wound
the
motor
handle
i
waited
with
a
sinking
heart
for
the
rest
of
the
sentence
like
certain
cases
of
nostalgia
i
have
known
very
rare
and
very
difficult
to
deal
with
acute
and
vehement
nostalgia
yes
sometimes
called
a
broken
heart
he
added
pausing
another
instant
at
the
carriage
door
in
which
the
entire
stream
of
a
man
inner
life
flows
to
some
distant
place
or
person
or
or
to
some
imagined
yearning
that
he
craves
to
satisfy
to
a
dream
it
be
even
that
he
answered
slowly
stepping
in
it
might
be
spiritual
the
religious
and
poetic
temperament
are
most
open
to
it
the
most
difficult
to
deal
with
when
afflicted
he
emphasized
the
little
word
as
though
the
doubt
he
felt
was
far
less
strong
than
the
conviction
he
only
half
concealed
if
you
would
save
him
try
to
change
the
direction
of
his
thoughts
there
is
nothing
in
all
honesty
i
must
say
it
nothing
that
i
can
do
to
help
and
then
pulling
at
the
grey
tuft
on
his
chin
and
looking
keenly
at
me
a
moment
over
his
glasses
those
flowers
he
said
hesitatingly
you
might
move
those
flowers
from
the
room
perhaps
their
perfume
is
a
trifle
strong
it
might
be
better
again
he
looked
sharply
at
me
there
was
an
odd
expression
in
his
eyes
and
in
my
heart
there
was
an
odd
sensation
too
so
odd
that
i
found
myself
bereft
a
moment
of
any
speech
at
all
and
when
my
tongue
became
untied
the
carriage
was
already
disappearing
down
the
street
for
in
that
dingy
there
were
no
flowers
at
all
yet
the
perfume
of
woods
and
fields
and
open
spaces
had
reached
the
doctor
too
and
obviously
perplexed
him
change
the
direction
of
his
thoughts
i
went
indoors
wondering
how
any
honest
and
even
friend
knowing
what
i
knew
could
follow
such
advice
with
what
but
the
lowest
motive
of
keeping
him
alive
for
my
own
happiness
could
i
seek
to
change
his
thoughts
of
some
imagined
joy
and
peace
to
the
pain
and
sordid
facts
of
an
earthly
existence
that
he
loathed
but
when
i
turned
i
saw
the
tousled
landlady
standing
in
the
breach
heath
stopped
me
in
the
hall
to
inquire
whether
i
could
say
anythink
abart
the
rent
her
manner
was
defiant
i
found
three
months
were
owing
it
no
good
arsking
she
said
though
not
unkindly
on
the
whole
i
sick
an
tired
of
always
being
put
off
he
talks
about
the
gawds
and
a
pan
or
some
such
gentleman
who
he
says
will
look
after
it
all
but
i
never
sees
not
this
pan
and
his
stuff
up
there
jerking
her
head
toward
the
little
room
ai
worth
a
take
the
lot
of
it
at
cost
i
reassured
her
it
was
impossible
to
help
smiling
for
some
minds
i
reflected
a
sankey
might
hold
dreams
that
were
every
bit
as
potent
as
his
own
and
far
less
troublesome
but
that
pan
or
some
such
gentleman
should
serve
as
a
reference
between
lodger
and
landlady
was
an
unwitting
comment
on
the
modern
point
of
view
that
made
me
want
to
cry
rather
than
to
laugh
and
heath
between
them
had
made
a
profounder
criticism
than
they
knew
and
so
by
slow
degrees
he
went
leaving
the
outer
fury
for
the
inner
peace
the
center
of
consciousness
gradually
shifted
from
the
transient
form
which
is
the
true
ghost
to
the
deeper
permanent
state
which
is
the
eternal
reality
for
this
was
how
he
phrased
it
to
me
in
one
of
our
last
strange
talks
he
watched
his
own
withdrawal
in
bed
he
would
lie
for
hours
with
fixed
and
happy
eyes
staring
apparently
at
nothing
the
expression
on
his
face
quite
radiant
the
pulse
sank
often
dangerously
low
he
scarcely
seemed
to
breathe
yet
it
was
never
complete
unconsciousness
or
trance
my
voice
when
i
found
the
heart
to
try
and
coax
his
own
for
speech
would
win
him
back
the
eyes
would
then
grow
dimmer
losing
their
happier
light
as
he
turned
to
the
outer
world
to
look
at
me
the
pull
is
so
tremendous
now
he
whispered
i
was
far
so
far
away
in
the
deep
life
of
earth
why
do
you
bring
me
back
to
all
these
little
pains
i
can
do
nothing
here
i
am
of
use
he
spoke
so
low
i
had
to
bend
my
head
to
catch
the
words
it
was
very
late
at
night
and
for
hours
i
had
been
watching
by
his
side
outside
an
ugly
yellow
fog
oppressed
the
town
but
about
him
like
an
atmosphere
i
caught
again
that
fragrance
as
of
trees
and
flowers
it
was
too
faint
for
any
name
that
fugitive
mild
perfume
one
meets
upon
bare
hills
and
round
the
skirts
of
forests
it
was
somehow
i
fancied
in
the
very
breath
each
time
the
effort
to
return
is
greater
in
there
i
am
complete
and
full
of
power
i
can
work
and
send
my
message
back
so
splendidly
here
he
glanced
down
at
his
wasted
body
with
a
curious
smile
i
am
only
on
the
fringe
it
pain
and
failure
all
so
ineffective
that
other
look
came
back
into
the
eyes
more
swiftly
than
before
i
thought
you
might
like
to
speak
to
tell
me
something
i
said
keeping
the
tears
with
difficulty
from
my
voice
is
there
no
one
you
would
like
to
see
he
shook
his
head
slowly
and
gave
the
peculiar
answer
they
all
in
there
but
stahl
perhaps
if
i
could
get
him
here
an
expression
of
gentle
disapproval
crossed
his
face
then
melted
softly
into
a
wistful
tenderness
as
of
a
child
he
not
there
yet
he
whispered
but
he
will
come
too
in
the
end
in
sleep
i
think
he
goes
there
even
now
where
are
you
then
i
ventured
and
where
is
it
you
go
to
the
answer
came
unhesitatingly
there
was
no
doubt
or
searching
into
myself
my
real
and
deeper
self
and
so
beyond
it
into
her
the
earth
where
all
the
others
are
all
all
all
and
then
he
frightened
me
by
sitting
up
in
bed
abruptly
his
eyes
stared
past
me
out
beyond
the
close
confining
walls
the
movement
was
so
startling
with
its
suddenness
and
vigor
that
i
shrank
back
a
moment
the
head
was
sideways
he
was
intently
listening
hark
he
whispered
they
are
calling
me
do
you
hear
the
look
of
joy
that
broke
over
the
face
like
sunshine
made
me
hold
my
breath
something
in
his
low
voice
thrilled
me
beyond
all
i
have
ever
known
i
listened
too
only
the
rumble
of
the
traffic
down
the
distant
main
street
broke
the
silence
the
rattle
of
a
nearer
cart
and
the
footsteps
of
a
few
pedestrians
no
other
noises
came
across
the
night
there
was
no
wind
thick
yellow
fog
muffled
everything
i
hear
nothing
i
answered
softly
what
is
it
that
hear
and
making
no
reply
he
presently
lay
down
again
among
the
pillows
that
look
of
joy
and
glory
still
upon
his
face
it
lay
there
to
the
end
like
sunrise
the
fog
came
in
so
thickly
through
the
window
that
i
rose
to
close
it
he
never
closed
that
window
and
i
hoped
he
would
not
notice
for
a
sound
of
wretched
was
coming
nearer
some
beggar
playing
dismally
upon
a
penny
whistle
and
i
feared
it
would
disturb
him
but
in
a
flash
he
was
up
again
no
no
he
cried
raising
his
voice
for
the
first
time
that
night
do
not
shut
it
i
sha
be
able
to
hear
then
let
all
the
air
come
in
open
it
wider
wider
i
love
that
sound
the
fog
there
is
no
fog
it
only
sun
and
flowers
and
music
let
them
in
do
you
hear
it
now
he
added
and
more
to
bring
him
peace
than
anything
else
i
bowed
my
head
to
signify
agreement
for
the
last
confusion
of
the
mind
i
saw
was
upon
him
and
he
made
the
outer
world
confirm
some
imagined
detail
of
his
inner
dream
i
drew
the
sash
down
lower
covering
his
body
closely
with
the
blankets
he
flung
them
off
impatiently
at
once
the
damp
and
freezing
night
rushed
in
upon
us
like
a
presence
it
made
me
shudder
but
only
raised
himself
upon
one
elbow
to
taste
it
better
and
to
listen
then
waiting
patiently
for
the
return
of
the
quiet
state
when
i
might
cover
him
again
i
moved
toward
the
window
and
looked
out
the
street
was
empty
save
for
that
beggar
playing
vilely
on
his
penny
whistle
the
wretch
came
to
a
standstill
immediately
before
the
house
the
lamplight
fell
from
the
room
upon
his
tattered
broken
figure
i
could
not
see
his
face
he
groped
and
felt
his
way
outside
that
homeless
wanderer
played
his
penny
pipe
in
the
night
of
cold
and
darkness
inside
the
dreamer
listened
dreaming
of
his
gods
and
garden
his
great
earth
mother
his
visioned
life
of
peace
and
simple
things
with
a
living
nature
and
i
felt
somehow
that
player
watched
us
i
made
an
angry
sign
to
him
to
go
but
it
was
the
sudden
touch
upon
my
arm
that
made
me
turn
round
with
such
a
sudden
start
that
i
almost
cried
aloud
in
his
stood
close
against
me
on
the
floor
slight
as
a
spirit
eyes
lips
moving
faintly
into
speech
through
the
most
wonderful
smile
a
human
face
has
ever
shown
me
do
not
send
him
away
he
whispered
joy
breaking
from
him
like
a
light
but
tell
him
that
i
love
it
go
out
and
thank
him
tell
him
i
hear
and
understand
and
say
that
i
am
coming
will
you
something
within
me
whirled
it
seemed
that
i
was
lifted
from
my
feet
a
moment
some
tide
of
power
rushed
from
his
person
to
my
own
the
room
was
filled
with
blinding
light
but
in
my
heart
there
rose
a
great
emotion
that
combined
tears
and
joy
and
laughter
all
at
once
the
moment
you
are
back
in
bed
i
heard
my
voice
like
one
speaking
from
a
distance
i
go
the
momentary
wild
confusion
passed
as
suddenly
as
it
came
i
remember
he
obeyed
at
once
as
i
bent
down
to
tuck
the
clothes
about
him
that
fragrance
as
of
flowers
and
open
spaces
rose
about
my
bending
face
like
incense
bewilderingly
sweet
and
the
next
second
i
was
standing
in
the
street
the
man
who
played
upon
the
pipe
i
saw
was
blind
his
hand
and
fingers
were
curiously
large
i
was
already
close
ready
to
press
all
that
my
pockets
held
into
his
hand
ay
and
far
more
than
merely
pockets
held
because
said
he
loved
the
music
when
something
made
me
turn
my
head
away
i
can
not
say
precisely
what
it
was
for
first
it
seemed
a
tapping
at
the
window
of
his
room
behind
me
and
then
a
little
noise
within
the
room
itself
and
next
more
curious
than
either
a
feeling
that
something
came
out
rushing
past
me
through
the
air
it
whirled
and
shouted
as
it
went
i
only
remember
clearly
that
in
the
very
act
of
turning
and
while
my
look
still
held
that
beggar
face
within
the
field
of
vision
i
saw
the
sightless
eyes
turn
bright
a
moment
as
though
he
opened
them
and
saw
he
did
most
certainly
smile
to
that
i
swear
but
when
i
turned
again
the
street
immediately
about
me
was
empty
the
was
gone
and
down
the
pavement
moving
swiftly
through
the
curtain
of
fog
i
saw
his
vanishing
figure
it
was
large
and
spreading
in
the
fringe
of
light
the
gave
its
upper
edges
seemed
far
above
the
ground
someone
else
was
with
him
there
were
two
figures
i
heard
that
sound
of
piping
far
away
it
sounded
faint
and
almost
in
the
air
and
in
the
mud
at
my
feet
the
money
lay
spurned
utterly
i
heard
the
last
coins
ring
upon
the
pavement
as
they
settled
but
in
the
room
when
i
got
back
the
body
of
terence
had
ceased
to
breathe
