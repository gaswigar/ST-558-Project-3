parker
leaning
indolently
against
the
edge
of
the
kitchen
table
watched
weems
stem
strawberries
into
a
bright
green
bowl
tempting
bait
for
dad
jaded
appetite
she
remarked
helping
herself
to
the
largest
berry
in
the
dish
if
he
ca
eat
them
i
can
i
do
wish
you
leave
those
berries
alone
the
housekeeper
protested
in
an
exasperated
tone
they
have
been
washed
yet
oh
i
do
mind
a
few
germs
laughed
penny
i
just
toss
them
off
like
a
duck
shedding
water
shall
i
take
the
breakfast
tray
up
to
dad
yes
i
wish
you
would
penny
sighed
weems
i
right
tired
on
my
feet
this
morning
hot
weather
always
did
wear
me
down
she
washed
the
berries
and
then
offered
the
tray
of
food
to
penny
who
started
with
it
toward
the
kitchen
vestibule
now
where
are
you
going
penelope
parker
weems
demanded
suspiciously
oh
just
to
the
automatic
lift
penny
blue
eyes
were
round
with
innocence
do
you
dare
try
to
ride
in
that
contraption
again
scolded
the
housekeeper
it
was
never
built
to
carry
human
freight
i
not
exactly
freight
penny
said
with
an
injured
sniff
it
strong
enough
to
carry
me
i
know
because
i
tried
it
last
week
you
walk
up
the
stairs
like
a
lady
or
i
take
the
tray
myself
weems
threatened
i
declare
i
do
know
when
you
grow
up
oh
all
right
grumbled
penny
but
i
do
maintain
it
a
shameful
waste
of
energy
balancing
the
tray
precariously
on
the
palm
of
her
hand
she
tripped
lightly
up
the
stairway
and
tapped
on
the
door
of
her
father
bedroom
come
in
he
called
in
a
muffled
voice
anthony
parker
editor
and
owner
of
the
sat
propped
up
with
pillows
reading
a
edition
of
the
newspaper
dad
said
penny
cheerfully
how
is
our
invalid
today
i
no
more
an
invalid
than
you
are
returned
parker
testily
if
that
old
quack
doctor
horn
does
let
me
out
of
bed
today
you
simply
explode
wo
you
dad
penny
finished
mischievously
here
drink
your
coffee
and
you
feel
less
like
a
stick
of
dynamite
parker
tossed
the
newspaper
aside
and
made
a
place
on
his
knees
for
the
breakfast
tray
did
i
hear
an
argument
between
you
and
mrs
weems
he
asked
curiously
no
argument
dad
i
just
wanted
to
ride
up
in
style
on
the
lift
weems
thought
it
was
a
civilized
way
to
travel
i
should
think
not
the
corners
of
parker
mouth
twitched
slightly
as
he
poured
coffee
from
the
silver
pot
that
lift
was
built
to
carry
breakfast
trays
but
not
in
combination
with
athletic
young
ladies
what
a
bore
this
business
of
growing
up
sighed
penny
you
ca
be
natural
at
all
you
seem
to
manage
rather
well
with
all
the
restrictions
her
father
remarked
dryly
penny
twisted
her
neck
to
gaze
at
her
reflection
in
the
dresser
mirror
beyond
the
footboard
of
the
big
mahogany
bed
i
wo
mind
growing
up
if
only
i
able
to
develop
plenty
of
glamour
she
said
speculatively
am
i
getting
any
better
looking
dad
not
that
i
noticed
replied
parker
gruffly
but
his
gaze
lingered
affectionately
upon
his
daughter
golden
hair
she
really
was
growing
prettier
each
day
and
looked
more
like
her
mother
who
had
died
when
penny
was
a
little
girl
he
had
spoiled
her
of
course
for
she
was
an
only
child
but
he
was
proud
because
he
had
taught
her
to
think
straight
she
was
deeply
loyal
and
affectionate
and
those
who
loved
her
overlooked
her
casual
ways
and
flippant
speech
what
happened
to
the
paper
boy
this
morning
parker
asked
between
bites
of
buttered
toast
it
is
time
for
him
yet
dad
said
penny
demurely
you
always
expect
him
at
least
an
hour
early
first
edition
been
off
the
press
a
good
half
hour
grumbled
the
newspaper
owner
when
i
get
back
to
the
office
i
see
that
deliveries
are
speeded
up
just
wait
until
i
talk
with
roberts
have
you
been
doing
a
pretty
strenuous
job
of
running
the
paper
right
from
your
bed
inquired
penny
as
she
refilled
her
father
cup
sometimes
when
you
talk
with
that
poor
circulation
manager
i
think
the
telephone
wires
will
burn
off
so
i
a
tyrant
am
i
oh
everyone
knows
your
bark
is
worse
than
your
bite
dad
but
certainly
not
been
at
your
best
the
last
few
days
parker
eyes
roved
about
the
luxuriously
furnished
bedroom
tinted
walls
chintz
draperies
the
rich
deep
rug
were
completely
lost
upon
him
this
place
is
a
prison
he
grumbled
for
nearly
a
week
the
household
had
been
thrown
completely
out
of
its
usual
routine
by
the
editor
illness
overwork
combined
with
an
attack
of
influenza
had
sent
him
to
bed
there
to
remain
until
he
should
be
released
by
a
doctor
order
with
a
telephone
at
his
elbow
parker
had
kept
in
close
touch
with
the
staff
of
the
but
he
fretted
at
confinement
i
ca
half
look
after
things
he
complained
and
now
miss
hilderman
the
society
editor
is
sick
i
do
know
how
we
get
a
good
story
on
the
kippenberg
wedding
penny
looked
up
quickly
miss
hilderman
is
ill
yes
dewitt
the
city
editor
telephoned
me
a
few
minutes
ago
she
was
able
to
show
up
for
work
this
morning
i
really
do
see
why
he
should
bother
you
about
that
dad
ca
miss
hilderman
assistant
take
over
the
duties
the
routine
work
yes
but
i
do
care
to
trust
her
with
the
kippenberg
story
is
it
something
extra
special
dad
surely
you
heard
of
clayton
kippenberg
the
name
is
familiar
but
i
ca
seem
to
recall
clayton
kippenberg
made
a
mint
of
money
in
the
chain
drug
business
no
one
ever
knew
exactly
the
extent
of
his
fortune
he
built
an
elaborate
estate
about
a
hundred
and
miles
from
here
familiarly
called
because
of
its
resemblance
to
an
ancient
feudal
castle
the
estate
is
cut
off
from
the
mainland
on
three
sides
and
may
be
reached
either
by
boat
or
by
means
of
a
picturesque
drawbridge
sounds
interesting
commented
penny
i
never
saw
the
place
myself
in
fact
kippenberg
never
allowed
outsiders
to
visit
the
estate
less
than
a
year
ago
a
rumor
floated
around
that
he
had
separated
from
his
wife
there
also
was
considerable
talk
that
he
had
disappeared
because
of
difficulties
with
the
government
over
income
tax
evasion
and
wished
to
escape
arrest
at
any
rate
he
faded
out
of
the
picture
while
his
wife
remained
in
possession
of
and
now
she
is
marrying
again
no
it
is
kippenberg
daughter
sylvia
who
is
to
be
married
the
bridegroom
grant
atherwald
comes
from
a
very
old
and
distinguished
family
i
do
see
why
the
story
should
be
so
difficult
to
cover
kippenberg
has
ruled
that
no
reporters
or
photographers
will
be
allowed
on
the
estate
explained
parker
that
does
complicate
the
situation
yes
it
may
not
be
easy
to
persuade
kippenberg
to
change
her
mind
i
rather
doubt
that
our
assistant
society
editor
has
the
ingenuity
to
handle
the
story
then
why
do
you
send
one
of
the
regular
reporters
jerry
livingston
for
instance
jerry
could
tell
a
tulle
wedding
veil
from
one
of
crinoline
nor
could
any
other
man
on
the
staff
i
could
get
that
story
for
you
penny
said
suddenly
why
do
you
try
me
parker
gazed
at
his
daughter
speculatively
do
you
really
think
you
could
of
course
penny
spoke
with
assurance
did
i
bring
in
two
perfectly
good
scoops
for
your
old
sheet
you
certainly
did
your
vanishing
houseboat
yarn
was
one
of
the
best
stories
we
published
in
a
year
of
sundays
and
the
town
is
still
talking
about
tale
of
the
witch
doll
after
what
i
went
through
to
get
those
stories
a
mere
wedding
would
be
child
play
do
be
too
confident
warned
parker
if
kippenberg
alter
her
decision
about
reporters
the
story
may
be
impossible
to
get
may
i
try
penny
asked
eagerly
parker
frowned
well
i
do
know
i
hate
to
send
you
so
far
and
then
i
have
a
feeling
yes
dad
i
ca
put
my
thoughts
into
words
it
just
that
my
newspaper
instinct
tells
me
this
story
may
develop
into
something
big
disappearance
never
was
fully
explained
and
his
wife
refused
to
discuss
the
affair
with
reporters
kippenberg
might
be
at
the
wedding
said
penny
thinking
aloud
if
he
were
a
normal
father
he
would
wish
to
see
his
daughter
married
you
follow
my
line
of
thought
penny
when
you
at
the
estate
if
you
get
in
keep
your
eyes
and
ears
open
then
you
let
me
cover
the
story
penny
cried
in
delight
yes
i
telephone
the
office
now
and
arrange
for
a
photographer
to
go
with
you
tell
them
to
send
salt
sommers
penny
suggested
quickly
he
act
as
as
some
of
the
other
lads
i
had
sommers
in
mind
her
father
nodded
as
he
reached
for
the
telephone
and
i
have
a
lot
more
than
salt
sommers
in
mind
laughed
penny
meaning
another
big
story
dad
a
scoop
for
the
and
this
for
you
penny
implanted
a
kiss
on
her
father
cheek
and
skipped
joyously
from
the
room
chapter
not
in
the
editorial
room
of
the
heads
turned
and
eyebrows
lifted
as
penny
decked
in
her
best
silk
dress
and
white
picture
hat
clicked
her
slippers
across
the
bare
floor
jerry
livingston
reporter
stopped
pecking
at
his
typewriter
and
stared
in
undisguised
admiration
well
if
it
is
our
bright
penny
he
bantered
did
recognize
you
for
a
minute
in
all
those
glad
rags
these
are
my
work
clothes
replied
penny
i
covering
the
kippenberg
wedding
jerry
pushed
his
hat
farther
back
on
his
head
and
grinned
tough
assignment
from
what
i
hear
of
the
kippenberg
family
you
be
lucky
if
they
do
throw
the
wedding
cake
at
you
penny
laughed
and
went
on
winding
her
way
through
a
barricade
of
desks
to
the
office
of
the
society
editor
miss
arnold
the
assistant
was
talking
over
the
telephone
but
in
a
moment
she
finished
and
turned
to
face
the
girl
good
morning
miss
parker
she
said
stiffly
an
edge
to
her
voice
told
penny
more
clearly
than
words
that
the
young
woman
was
nettled
because
she
had
not
been
trusted
with
the
story
good
morning
replied
penny
politely
dad
said
you
would
be
able
to
give
me
helpful
suggestions
about
covering
the
kippenberg
wedding
there
not
much
i
can
tell
you
really
the
ceremony
is
to
take
place
at
two
in
the
garden
so
you
have
ample
time
to
reach
the
estate
if
you
get
in
miss
arnold
placed
an
unpleasant
emphasis
upon
the
words
take
notes
on
miss
kippenberg
gown
the
flowers
the
decorations
the
names
of
her
attendants
try
to
keep
your
facts
straight
nothing
infuriates
a
bride
more
than
to
read
in
the
paper
that
she
carried
a
bouquet
of
and
roses
while
actually
it
was
a
bouquet
of
some
other
flower
i
try
not
to
infuriate
miss
kippenberg
promised
penny
miss
arnold
glanced
quickly
at
her
but
the
girl
face
was
perfectly
serene
that
all
i
can
tell
you
miss
parker
she
said
shortly
bring
in
at
least
a
column
for
some
reason
the
city
editor
rates
the
wedding
an
important
story
i
do
my
best
responded
penny
and
arose
salt
sommers
was
waiting
for
her
when
she
came
out
of
the
office
he
was
a
tall
spare
young
man
with
a
deep
scar
down
his
left
cheek
he
talked
nearly
as
fast
as
he
walked
if
you
all
set
let
go
he
said
penny
found
herself
three
paces
behind
but
she
caught
up
with
the
photographer
as
he
waited
for
the
elevator
i
taking
minny
along
salt
volunteered
holding
his
finger
steadily
on
the
signal
bell
may
come
in
handy
minny
asked
penny
puzzled
miniature
camera
you
ca
always
use
the
model
x
oh
murmured
penny
deeply
embarrassed
she
remained
silent
as
the
elevator
shot
them
down
to
the
ground
floor
salt
loaded
his
photographic
equipment
into
a
battered
press
car
which
was
parked
near
the
loading
dock
at
the
rear
of
the
building
he
slid
in
behind
the
wheel
and
then
as
an
afterthought
swung
open
the
car
door
for
penny
salt
seemed
to
know
the
way
to
the
kippenberg
estate
they
shot
through
riverview
traffic
shaving
red
lights
and
tooting
derisively
at
slow
drivers
in
open
country
he
pressed
the
accelerator
down
to
the
floor
and
the
car
roared
down
the
road
only
slackening
speed
as
it
raced
through
a
town
how
do
you
travel
when
you
in
a
hurry
penny
gasped
clinging
to
her
flopping
hat
salt
grinned
and
lifted
his
foot
from
the
gasoline
pedal
sorry
he
said
i
get
in
the
habit
of
driving
fast
we
have
plenty
of
time
as
they
rode
penny
gathered
scraps
of
information
the
kippenberg
estate
was
located
six
miles
from
the
town
of
corbin
and
was
cut
off
from
the
mainland
on
three
sides
by
the
joining
of
two
wide
rivers
one
with
a
direct
outlet
to
the
ocean
salt
did
not
know
when
the
house
had
been
built
but
it
was
considered
one
of
the
show
places
of
the
locality
do
you
think
we
have
much
trouble
getting
our
story
penny
asked
anxiously
all
depends
salt
answered
briefly
he
slammed
on
the
brake
so
suddenly
that
penny
was
flung
forward
in
the
seat
another
car
coming
from
the
opposite
direction
had
pulled
up
at
the
side
of
the
road
penny
did
not
recognize
the
three
men
who
were
crowded
into
the
front
seat
but
the
printed
placard
which
was
pasted
on
the
windshield
told
her
they
represented
a
rival
newspaper
in
riverview
what
luck
les
salt
called
craning
his
neck
out
the
car
window
you
may
as
well
turn
around
and
go
back
came
the
disgusted
reply
the
old
lady
wo
let
a
reporter
or
a
photographer
on
the
estate
she
has
a
guard
stationed
on
the
drawbridge
to
see
that
you
do
get
past
the
car
drove
on
toward
riverview
salt
sat
staring
down
the
road
drumming
his
fingers
thoughtfully
on
the
steering
wheel
looks
like
we
up
against
a
tough
assignment
he
said
if
les
get
in
i
not
going
back
without
at
least
an
attempt
announced
penny
firmly
that
the
spirit
salt
cried
with
sudden
approval
we
get
on
the
estate
somehow
if
we
have
to
swim
over
he
jerked
the
press
card
from
the
windshield
and
reaching
into
the
back
seat
of
the
car
covered
the
model
x
camera
with
an
old
gunny
sack
the
miniature
camera
he
placed
in
his
coat
pocket
no
use
advertising
our
profession
too
early
in
the
game
he
remarked
found
penny
and
salt
in
the
sleepy
little
town
of
corbin
fortifying
themselves
with
a
lunch
of
hot
dog
sandwiches
and
pop
they
followed
a
winding
dusty
highway
toward
the
kippenberg
estate
presently
through
the
trees
marking
the
end
of
the
road
an
iron
drawbridge
loomed
up
it
stood
in
open
position
so
that
boats
might
pass
on
the
river
below
a
wooden
barrier
had
been
erected
across
the
front
of
the
structure
which
bore
a
large
painted
sign
penny
read
the
words
aloud
drawbridge
keep
off
salt
drew
up
at
the
side
of
the
road
looks
as
if
this
is
as
far
as
we
going
he
said
in
disgust
there
no
other
road
to
the
estate
i
bet
that
drawbridge
business
is
just
a
dodge
to
keep
undesirables
away
from
the
place
until
after
the
wedding
penny
nodded
gloomily
then
she
brightened
as
she
noticed
an
old
man
who
obviously
was
an
estate
guard
standing
at
the
entrance
to
the
bridge
he
stared
toward
the
old
car
as
if
trying
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
the
occupants
were
expected
guests
i
going
over
to
talk
with
him
penny
said
pretend
that
you
a
guest
suggested
salt
you
look
the
part
in
that
fancy
outfit
of
yours
penny
walked
leisurely
toward
the
drawbridge
appraisingly
she
studied
the
old
man
who
leaned
comfortably
against
the
gearhouse
a
dilapidated
hat
pulled
low
over
his
shaggy
brows
seemed
in
keeping
with
the
rest
of
his
wardrobe
a
blue
work
shirt
and
a
pair
of
overalls
a
charred
pipe
thrust
at
an
angle
between
his
lips
provided
sure
protection
against
the
mosquitoes
swarming
up
from
the
river
below
good
afternoon
began
penny
pleasantly
my
friend
and
i
are
looking
for
the
kippenberg
estate
we
were
told
at
corbin
to
take
this
road
but
we
seem
to
have
made
a
mistake
you
ai
made
no
mistake
miss
the
old
man
replied
then
is
the
estate
across
the
river
that
right
miss
but
how
are
guests
to
reach
the
place
i
see
the
sign
says
the
bridge
is
out
of
commission
are
we
supposed
to
swim
over
not
if
you
do
want
to
the
old
man
answered
evenly
kippenberg
has
a
launch
that
takes
the
folks
back
and
forth
it
on
the
other
side
now
but
will
be
back
in
no
time
at
all
i
wait
in
the
car
out
of
the
hot
sun
penny
said
she
started
away
then
paused
to
inquire
casually
is
this
drawbridge
really
out
of
order
the
old
man
was
deliberate
in
his
reply
he
blew
a
ring
of
smoke
into
the
air
watched
it
hover
like
a
floating
skein
of
wool
and
finally
disintegrate
as
if
plucked
to
pieces
by
an
unseen
hand
well
yes
and
no
he
said
it
ai
exactly
sick
but
she
sure
is
ailin
i
would
trust
no
heavy
contraption
on
this
bridge
condemned
by
the
state
i
suppose
no
miss
and
i
tell
you
why
this
here
bridge
does
belong
to
the
state
it
a
private
bridge
on
a
private
road
odd
that
kippenberg
never
had
it
repaired
penny
remarked
it
must
be
annoying
it
is
to
all
them
that
do
like
launches
as
for
kippenberg
she
do
mind
fact
is
she
ai
much
afraid
of
the
bridge
she
drives
her
car
across
whenever
she
takes
the
notion
then
the
bridge
does
operate
penny
exclaimed
sure
it
does
that
my
job
to
raise
and
lower
it
whenever
the
owner
says
the
word
but
the
bridge
ai
fit
for
delivery
trucks
and
one
of
them
big
babies
would
crack
through
like
goin
over
sponge
ice
well
i
rather
envy
your
employer
said
penny
lightly
it
is
every
lady
who
has
her
own
private
drawbridge
she
is
kind
of
that
way
miss
kippenberg
she
keeps
the
drawbridge
up
so
she
have
more
privacy
and
i
ai
blamin
her
these
here
newspaper
reporters
always
is
the
life
out
of
her
penny
nodded
sympathetically
and
walked
back
to
make
her
report
to
salt
no
luck
he
demanded
guess
twice
she
laughed
the
old
bridgeman
just
took
it
for
granted
i
was
one
of
the
wedding
guests
it
will
be
all
right
for
us
to
go
over
in
the
guest
launch
as
soon
as
it
arrives
salt
gazed
ruefully
at
his
clothes
i
do
look
much
like
a
guest
think
i
pass
inspection
maybe
you
could
get
by
as
one
of
the
poor
relations
grinned
penny
pull
your
hat
down
and
straighten
your
tie
salt
shook
his
head
a
business
suit
with
a
grease
spot
on
the
vest
is
the
correct
dress
for
a
formal
wedding
you
might
get
by
but
i
wo
then
should
i
try
it
alone
i
have
to
get
those
pictures
somehow
stated
salt
grimly
maybe
we
could
hire
a
boat
of
our
own
penny
suggested
of
course
it
would
look
as
well
as
if
we
arrived
on
the
guest
launch
let
see
what
we
can
line
up
salt
said
swinging
open
the
car
door
they
walked
to
the
river
edge
and
looked
in
both
directions
there
were
no
small
boats
to
be
seen
the
only
available
craft
was
a
large
motor
boat
which
came
slowly
downstream
toward
the
open
drawbridge
penny
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
pilot
a
burly
man
with
a
red
puffy
face
salt
slid
down
the
bank
toward
the
water
edge
and
hailed
the
boat
hey
you
he
called
two
bucks
to
take
me
across
the
river
the
man
inclined
his
head
looked
steadily
at
salt
for
an
instant
then
deliberately
turned
his
back
five
shouted
salt
the
pilot
gave
no
sign
that
he
had
heard
instead
he
speeded
up
the
boat
which
passed
beneath
the
drawbridge
and
went
on
down
the
river
chapter
to
the
perhaps
he
did
hear
you
said
penny
peering
after
the
retreating
boat
he
heard
me
all
right
growled
salt
as
he
scrambled
back
up
the
high
bank
noticing
a
small
boy
in
dirty
overalls
who
sat
at
the
water
edge
fishing
he
called
to
him
say
sonny
who
was
that
fellow
do
you
know
nope
answered
the
boy
barely
turning
his
head
but
his
boat
has
been
going
up
and
down
the
river
all
morning
that
why
i
ca
catch
anything
the
boat
rounded
a
bend
of
the
river
and
was
lost
to
view
only
one
other
craft
appeared
on
the
water
a
freshly
painted
white
motor
launch
which
could
be
seen
coming
from
the
far
shore
that
must
be
the
guest
boat
now
remarked
penny
shading
her
eyes
against
the
glare
of
the
sun
it
seems
to
be
our
only
hope
let
try
to
get
aboard
and
see
what
happens
proposed
the
photographer
they
walked
leisurely
back
toward
the
guard
at
the
drawbridge
timing
their
arrival
just
as
the
launch
swung
up
to
the
landing
with
a
cool
assurance
which
penny
tried
to
duplicate
salt
stepped
aboard
nodded
indifferently
to
the
wheelsman
and
slumped
down
in
one
of
the
leather
seats
penny
waited
uneasily
for
embarrassing
questions
which
did
not
come
gradually
she
relaxed
as
the
boatman
took
no
interest
in
them
and
the
guard
attention
was
fully
occupied
with
other
cars
which
had
driven
up
to
the
drawbridge
a
few
minutes
later
two
elderly
women
both
elegantly
gowned
were
helped
aboard
the
boat
by
their
chauffeur
one
of
the
women
stared
disapprovingly
at
salt
through
her
lorgnette
and
then
ignored
him
we
get
by
all
right
salt
whispered
confidently
wait
until
kippenberg
sees
us
warned
penny
oh
we
keep
out
of
her
way
until
we
have
our
story
and
plenty
of
pictures
once
we
across
the
river
it
will
be
easy
i
hope
you
right
muttered
penny
while
salt
task
of
taking
pictures
might
prove
relatively
simple
she
realized
that
her
own
work
would
be
anything
but
easy
she
could
not
hope
to
gather
many
facts
without
talking
to
a
member
of
the
family
and
the
instant
she
admitted
her
identity
she
likely
would
be
ejected
from
the
grounds
i
boasted
i
bring
in
a
front
page
story
she
thought
ruefully
be
lucky
if
i
get
a
column
of
routine
stuff
the
boat
was
moving
slowly
away
from
the
landing
when
the
guard
at
the
drawbridge
called
in
a
loud
voice
hold
it
joe
penny
and
salt
stiffened
in
their
chairs
fearing
they
were
to
be
exposed
but
they
were
both
greatly
relieved
to
see
that
a
long
black
limousine
had
drawn
up
at
the
end
of
the
road
the
launch
had
been
stopped
so
that
additional
passengers
might
be
accommodated
salt
nudged
penny
elbow
grant
atherwald
he
contributed
jerking
his
head
toward
a
tall
young
man
who
had
stepped
from
the
car
i
seen
his
picture
plenty
of
times
the
bridegroom
penny
turned
to
stare
sure
he
one
of
the
but
they
say
he
a
little
short
on
ready
cash
the
young
man
dressed
immaculately
in
formal
day
attire
and
accompanied
by
two
other
men
came
aboard
the
launch
he
bowed
politely
to
the
elderly
women
and
his
gaze
fell
questioningly
upon
penny
and
salt
but
if
he
wondered
why
they
were
there
he
did
not
voice
his
thought
as
the
boat
put
out
across
the
river
penny
watched
grant
atherwald
curiously
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
appeared
nervous
and
preoccupied
he
stared
straight
before
him
clenching
and
unclenching
his
hands
his
face
was
colorless
and
drawn
he
nervous
and
worried
thought
penny
i
guess
all
bridegrooms
are
like
that
a
sharp
click
sounded
in
her
ear
penny
did
not
turn
toward
salt
but
she
caught
her
breath
knowing
what
he
had
done
he
had
dared
to
take
a
picture
of
grant
atherwald
she
waited
feeling
certain
that
the
sound
must
have
been
heard
by
everyone
in
the
boat
a
full
minute
elapsed
and
no
one
spoke
when
penny
finally
glanced
at
salt
he
was
gazing
serenely
out
across
the
muddy
water
his
miniature
camera
shielded
behind
a
felt
hat
which
he
held
on
his
knees
the
boat
docked
salt
and
penny
allowed
the
others
to
go
ashore
first
and
then
followed
a
narrow
walk
which
wound
through
a
deep
lane
of
evergreen
trees
salt
penny
asked
abruptly
how
did
you
get
that
picture
of
atherwald
snapped
it
through
a
hole
in
the
crown
of
my
hat
it
an
old
trick
i
always
wear
this
special
hat
when
i
sent
out
on
a
hard
assignment
i
thought
a
cannon
had
gone
off
when
the
shutter
clicked
penny
laughed
we
were
lucky
you
were
caught
emerging
from
behind
the
trees
they
obtained
their
first
view
of
the
kippenberg
house
sturdily
built
of
brick
and
stone
it
stood
upon
a
slight
hill
its
many
turrets
and
towers
commanding
a
view
of
the
two
rivers
nice
layout
salt
commented
pausing
to
snap
a
second
picture
wish
someone
would
give
me
a
castle
for
a
playhouse
they
crossed
the
moat
and
found
themselves
directly
behind
grant
atherwald
again
before
the
bridegroom
could
enter
the
house
a
servant
stepped
forward
and
handed
him
a
sealed
envelope
i
was
told
to
give
this
to
you
as
soon
as
you
arrived
sir
he
said
grant
atherwald
nodded
and
taking
the
letter
quickly
opened
it
a
troubled
expression
came
over
his
face
as
he
scanned
the
message
without
a
word
he
thrust
the
paper
into
his
pocket
turning
he
walked
swiftly
toward
the
garden
salt
did
you
notice
how
queerly
atherwald
looked
penny
began
but
the
photographer
interrupted
her
listen
he
said
we
have
a
chinaman
chance
of
getting
in
the
front
door
that
boy
in
the
fancy
knickers
is
giving
everyone
the
once
over
let
try
a
side
entrance
without
attracting
attention
they
walked
quickly
around
the
house
and
located
a
door
where
no
servant
had
been
posted
entering
they
passed
through
a
vestibule
into
a
breakfast
room
crowded
with
serving
tables
salt
nonchalantly
helped
himself
to
an
olive
from
one
of
the
large
glass
dishes
and
led
penny
on
toward
the
main
hall
where
many
of
the
guests
had
gathered
to
admire
the
wedding
gifts
now
do
swipe
any
of
the
silver
salt
said
jokingly
i
think
that
fellow
over
by
the
stairway
is
a
private
detective
he
seems
to
be
looking
at
us
with
a
suspicious
gleam
in
his
eyes
penny
replied
i
hope
we
do
get
tossed
out
of
here
we
be
all
right
if
kippenberg
does
see
us
before
the
ceremony
do
you
suppose
kippenberg
could
be
here
salt
not
likely
it
my
guess
that
fellow
will
never
be
seen
again
dad
does
share
your
opinion
i
know
salt
admitted
we
keep
watch
for
him
but
it
would
just
be
a
lucky
break
if
it
turns
out
he
here
mingling
with
the
guests
they
walked
slowly
about
a
long
table
where
the
wedding
gifts
were
displayed
penny
gazed
curiously
at
dishes
of
solid
silver
crystal
bowls
candlesticks
jade
ornaments
tea
sets
and
service
plates
encrusted
with
gold
nothing
trashy
here
muttered
salt
i
never
seen
such
an
elegant
display
penny
whispered
in
awe
do
you
suppose
that
picture
is
one
of
the
gifts
she
indicated
an
oil
painting
which
stood
on
an
easel
not
far
from
the
table
so
many
guests
had
gathered
about
the
picture
that
she
could
not
see
it
distinctly
but
at
her
elbow
a
woman
in
rustling
silk
said
to
a
companion
my
dear
a
genuine
van
gogh
it
must
have
cost
a
small
fortune
when
the
couple
had
moved
aside
penny
and
salt
drew
closer
to
the
easel
one
glance
assured
them
that
the
painting
had
been
executed
by
a
master
however
it
was
the
subject
of
the
picture
which
gave
penny
a
distinct
start
will
you
look
at
that
she
whispered
to
salt
what
about
it
he
asked
carelessly
do
you
notice
anything
significant
ca
say
i
do
it
just
a
nice
picture
of
a
drawbridge
that
just
the
point
salt
penny
eyes
danced
with
excitement
a
drawbridge
the
photographer
glanced
again
at
the
painting
this
time
with
deeper
interest
say
it
looks
a
lot
like
the
bridge
which
was
built
over
the
river
he
observed
you
think
this
picture
is
a
copy
of
it
penny
shook
her
head
impatiently
salt
your
knowledge
of
art
is
dreadful
this
van
gogh
was
painted
ages
ago
and
is
priceless
do
you
see
the
drawbridge
has
to
be
a
copy
of
the
picture
your
theory
sounds
reasonable
salt
admitted
i
wonder
who
gave
the
painting
to
the
bride
there
no
name
attached
ca
you
guess
why
i
never
was
good
at
kid
games
why
it
clear
as
crystal
penny
declared
keeping
her
voice
low
this
estate
with
the
drawbridge
was
built
by
clayton
kippenberg
he
must
have
been
familiar
with
the
van
gogh
painting
and
had
the
real
bridge
modeled
after
the
picture
for
that
matter
the
painting
may
have
been
in
his
possession
then
you
think
the
picture
was
presented
to
sylvia
kippenberg
by
her
father
salt
broke
in
quickly
yes
i
do
only
a
person
very
close
to
the
bride
would
have
given
such
a
gift
said
salt
squinting
at
the
picture
thoughtfully
if
you
right
it
means
that
clayton
kippenberg
whereabouts
must
be
known
to
his
family
his
disappearance
may
not
be
such
a
deep
mystery
to
mamma
kippenberg
and
daughter
sylvia
oh
salt
would
it
make
a
grand
story
if
only
we
could
learn
what
became
of
him
sure
front
page
stuff
we
simply
must
get
the
story
somehow
if
kippenberg
would
just
answer
our
questions
about
this
drawbridge
painting
i
afraid
mamma
kippenberg
is
going
to
break
down
and
tell
all
salt
said
dryly
but
buckle
on
your
steel
armor
little
girl
because
here
she
comes
now
chapter
the
a
large
woman
in
silk
crossed
the
room
directly
toward
salt
and
penny
her
pale
blue
eyes
glinted
with
anger
and
there
were
hard
lines
about
her
mouth
she
walked
haughtily
but
with
grim
purpose
unless
we
do
some
fast
talking
out
we
go
muttered
salt
it
kippenberg
all
right
they
stood
their
ground
knowing
they
had
been
recognized
as
intruders
but
before
the
woman
could
reach
them
she
was
stopped
by
a
servant
who
spoke
a
few
words
in
a
low
tone
for
a
moment
kippenberg
forgot
about
penny
and
salt
as
a
new
problem
presented
itself
i
ca
talk
with
anyone
now
she
said
in
an
agitated
voice
tell
them
to
come
back
later
they
insist
upon
talking
with
you
now
madam
replied
the
servant
unless
you
see
them
they
say
they
will
look
around
for
themselves
oh
kippenberg
drew
herself
up
sharply
as
if
from
a
physical
blow
where
are
they
now
in
the
library
madam
penny
did
not
hear
the
woman
reply
but
she
turned
and
followed
the
servant
saved
by
the
bell
mumbled
salt
now
let
get
away
from
here
before
she
comes
back
they
pushed
through
the
throng
and
reached
a
long
hallway
kippenberg
had
disappeared
but
as
they
drew
near
an
open
door
they
caught
sight
of
her
again
she
stood
just
inside
the
library
her
back
toward
them
talking
with
two
men
who
wore
plain
gray
business
suits
penny
half
drew
back
fearing
discovery
but
salt
pulled
her
along
as
they
went
quietly
past
the
door
they
heard
kippenberg
say
in
an
excited
voice
no
no
i
tell
you
he
is
here
why
should
i
try
to
deceive
you
we
have
nothing
to
hide
you
are
most
inconsiderate
to
annoy
me
at
such
a
time
penny
and
salt
did
not
hear
the
reply
they
reached
an
outside
door
and
stepped
down
on
a
flagstone
terrace
which
overlooked
the
garden
at
the
rear
of
the
grounds
who
were
those
men
do
you
suppose
penny
whispered
fearful
that
her
voice
might
betray
them
officers
of
the
law
i
should
guess
salt
replied
in
an
undertone
government
men
likely
as
not
i
do
believe
the
locals
would
bother
her
anyway
got
the
wind
up
and
you
can
tell
she
scared
silly
in
spite
of
all
her
back
talk
you
know
what
i
think
they
after
penny
said
thoughtfully
well
if
i
had
just
one
guess
salt
replied
i
say
they
are
after
mr
kippenberg
i
agree
with
you
there
sure
why
else
would
they
come
sleuthing
around
at
a
time
like
this
the
answer
is
simple
daughter
gets
married
papa
wants
to
see
his
darling
do
it
therefore
boys
we
spread
a
net
for
daddy
and
he
might
plump
right
into
it
so
that
the
way
a
g
man
mind
works
laughed
penny
but
i
would
take
it
that
kippenberg
is
no
fool
salt
went
on
if
they
really
have
a
wanted
sign
hung
on
him
he
would
be
too
cagey
to
come
around
here
today
they
were
standing
beside
the
stone
balustrade
which
bounded
the
terrace
below
them
the
green
foliage
of
the
gardens
formed
a
dark
background
for
the
playing
fountains
a
cool
breeze
drifted
in
from
the
river
and
rattled
a
window
awning
just
over
their
heads
we
in
an
exposed
place
here
observed
salt
uneasily
maybe
we
ought
to
find
a
hole
somewhere
we
never
learn
anything
in
a
hole
penny
objected
in
fact
not
making
much
progress
in
running
down
any
sort
of
story
i
do
wish
we
could
have
heard
more
of
that
conversation
and
get
thrown
out
on
our
collective
ear
before
we
even
have
a
chance
to
snap
a
picture
of
the
blushing
bride
pictures
pictures
exclaimed
penny
that
all
you
photographers
think
about
how
about
poor
little
me
and
my
story
after
all
you
bring
out
a
paper
full
of
nothing
but
pictures
and
cigarette
ads
you
need
a
little
news
to
go
with
it
you
like
to
work
too
fast
complained
salt
right
now
the
thing
to
do
is
to
keep
out
of
sight
i
telling
you
the
minute
kippy
finishes
with
those
men
she
be
gunning
for
us
then
i
suppose
we
have
to
go
into
hiding
first
let
mosey
out
into
the
rose
garden
salt
proposed
i
take
a
few
shots
and
then
we
duck
under
somewhere
and
wait
until
the
ceremony
starts
that
all
very
well
for
you
grumbled
penny
but
i
ca
write
much
of
a
story
without
talking
to
some
member
of
the
family
salt
started
off
across
the
velvety
green
lawn
toward
the
rose
arbor
where
the
service
was
to
be
held
penny
followed
reluctantly
she
watched
the
photographer
take
several
pictures
before
a
servant
approached
him
i
beg
your
pardon
the
man
said
coldly
but
kippenberg
gave
orders
no
pictures
were
to
be
taken
if
you
are
from
one
of
the
papers
oh
i
saw
her
in
the
house
just
a
minute
ago
salt
replied
carelessly
sorry
sir
the
servant
apologized
retreating
salt
finished
taking
the
pictures
and
slipped
the
miniature
camera
back
into
his
pocket
now
let
amble
down
toward
the
river
and
wait
he
said
to
penny
we
blossom
forth
just
as
the
ceremony
starts
kippy
wo
dare
interrupt
it
to
have
us
thrown
off
the
grounds
they
walked
down
a
sloping
path
past
a
hothouse
and
on
toward
a
grove
of
giant
oak
and
maple
trees
it
pleasant
here
when
you
away
from
the
crowd
penny
remarked
gazing
up
at
the
leafy
canopy
i
wonder
where
this
path
leads
oh
down
to
the
river
probably
with
water
on
three
sides
of
us
that
a
fairly
safe
guess
which
rivers
flow
past
the
estate
salt
the
big
bear
and
the
kobalt
the
same
old
muddy
kobalt
which
is
near
our
town
said
penny
in
surprise
i
always
think
of
it
as
a
river
of
adventure
because
of
joe
and
his
vanishing
houseboat
penny
nodded
and
a
dreamy
look
came
into
her
eyes
so
much
happened
on
the
kobalt
salt
remember
that
big
party
dad
threw
at
the
comstock
inn
do
i
jerry
livingston
decided
to
sleep
in
room
seven
where
so
many
persons
had
disappeared
and
then
he
was
spirited
away
almost
before
our
very
eyes
added
penny
days
later
joe
helped
me
fish
him
out
of
this
same
old
kobalt
for
awhile
we
did
think
he
ever
pull
through
or
be
able
to
tell
what
had
happened
to
him
but
as
the
grand
finale
you
and
your
friend
louise
sidell
solved
the
mystery
and
secured
a
dandy
story
for
the
those
were
the
days
you
talk
as
if
they
were
gone
forever
laughed
penny
other
good
stories
will
come
along
maybe
said
salt
but
covering
a
wedding
is
pretty
tame
in
comparison
yet
this
one
does
have
interesting
angles
penny
insisted
ca
you
almost
feel
mystery
lurking
about
the
place
no
but
i
do
feel
a
mosquito
sinking
his
stinger
into
me
salt
slapped
vigorously
at
his
ankle
they
followed
the
path
on
toward
the
river
coming
soon
to
a
trail
which
branched
off
to
the
right
across
it
had
been
stretched
a
wire
barrier
and
a
neatly
lettered
sign
read
no
admittance
beyond
this
point
why
do
you
suppose
the
path
is
blocked
off
penny
speculated
let
find
out
salt
suggested
with
a
sudden
flare
of
interest
maybe
we
run
into
something
worth
a
picture
penny
hesitated
not
wishing
to
disregard
the
sign
yet
eager
to
learn
what
lay
beyond
the
barrier
listen
said
salt
just
put
your
little
conscience
on
ice
we
here
to
get
the
when
why
and
where
you
never
be
a
first
class
newspaper
reporter
if
you
stifle
your
curiosity
lead
on
laughed
penny
i
will
follow
only
is
it
getting
late
salt
looked
at
his
watch
we
still
have
a
safe
fifteen
minutes
he
started
to
step
over
the
wire
only
to
have
penny
reach
out
and
grasp
his
hand
wait
she
whispered
what
the
idea
salt
turned
toward
her
in
astonishment
i
think
someone
is
watching
us
i
sure
i
saw
the
bushes
move
your
nerves
are
jumpy
salt
jeered
it
only
the
wind
even
as
he
spoke
the
foliage
to
the
left
moved
ever
so
slightly
and
a
dark
form
could
be
seen
creeping
stealthily
away
along
the
ground
chapter
missing
salt
acted
instinctively
leaping
over
the
wire
barrier
he
dived
into
the
bushes
hurling
himself
upon
the
man
who
crouched
there
he
pinned
him
to
the
ground
the
fellow
gave
a
choked
cry
and
tried
to
pull
free
oh
no
you
do
salt
muttered
coolly
sitting
down
on
his
stomach
snooping
eh
you
let
me
up
the
man
cried
savagely
let
me
up
i
say
i
let
you
up
when
you
explain
what
you
were
doing
here
why
you
impudent
young
pup
the
man
spluttered
you
the
one
who
will
explain
i
am
kippenberg
head
gardener
salt
hand
fell
from
the
old
man
collar
and
he
apologetically
helped
him
to
his
feet
penny
who
had
reached
the
scene
stooped
down
and
recovered
a
trowel
which
had
slipped
from
the
gardener
grasp
it
was
just
a
little
mistake
on
my
part
salt
mumbled
i
hope
i
hurt
you
no
fault
of
yours
you
did
the
old
man
snapped
a
fine
howdydo
when
a
person
ca
even
loosen
earth
around
a
shrub
without
being
assaulted
by
a
ruffian
the
gardener
was
a
short
stout
man
with
graying
hair
he
wore
coarse
garments
a
loose
fitting
pair
of
trousers
a
dark
shirt
and
battered
felt
hat
but
penny
noticed
that
his
hands
and
fingernails
were
clean
and
there
were
no
trowel
marks
around
any
of
the
shrubs
salt
is
exactly
a
ruffian
she
said
as
the
photographer
offered
no
defense
after
all
from
where
we
stood
it
looked
exactly
as
if
you
were
hiding
in
the
bushes
then
you
both
need
glasses
the
man
retorted
rudely
a
person
work
without
getting
down
on
his
hands
and
knees
where
were
you
digging
penny
asked
innocently
i
was
just
starting
in
when
this
young
upstart
leaped
on
my
back
sorry
said
salt
but
i
thought
you
were
trying
to
get
away
who
are
you
anyway
the
gardener
demanded
bluntly
you
not
guests
i
can
tell
that
you
have
a
very
discerning
eye
replied
salt
smoothly
we
from
the
reporters
eh
the
old
man
scowled
unpleasantly
then
you
no
business
being
here
at
all
you
not
wanted
so
get
out
we
only
after
a
few
facts
about
the
wedding
penny
said
perhaps
you
would
be
willing
to
tell
me
i
tell
you
nothing
miss
if
anything
is
given
out
to
the
papers
it
will
have
to
come
from
mrs
kippenberg
fair
enough
salt
acknowledged
he
glanced
curiously
down
the
path
which
had
been
blocked
off
what
down
there
nothing
the
gardener
spoke
irritably
this
part
of
the
estate
been
fixed
up
that
why
it
closed
penny
had
bent
down
pretending
to
examine
a
shrub
at
the
edge
of
the
path
what
is
the
name
of
this
bush
she
inquired
casually
an
azalea
the
gardener
replied
after
a
slight
hesitation
now
get
out
of
here
will
you
i
have
my
work
to
do
oh
all
right
salt
rejoined
as
he
and
penny
moved
away
no
need
to
get
so
tough
they
stepped
over
the
barrier
wire
and
retraced
their
way
toward
the
house
several
times
penny
glanced
back
but
she
could
not
see
the
old
man
he
had
slipped
away
somewhere
among
the
trees
i
do
believe
that
fellow
was
a
gardener
she
said
suddenly
what
makes
you
think
not
did
you
notice
his
nice
clean
hands
and
fingernails
and
then
when
i
asked
him
the
name
of
that
bush
he
hesitated
and
called
it
an
azalea
i
saw
another
long
botanical
name
attached
to
it
maybe
he
just
made
a
mistake
or
said
the
first
thing
that
came
into
his
head
he
wanted
to
get
rid
of
us
i
know
he
did
nodded
penny
yet
when
he
found
out
we
were
from
the
he
did
threaten
to
report
us
to
mrs
kippenberg
that
so
he
was
afraid
to
report
us
penny
went
on
with
conviction
i
bet
a
cent
he
has
no
more
right
here
than
we
have
salt
had
lost
all
interest
in
the
gardener
he
glanced
at
his
watch
and
quickened
his
step
is
it
two
yet
penny
asked
anxiously
just
after
all
the
trouble
we
had
getting
here
we
ca
afford
to
miss
the
big
show
emerging
from
the
grove
salt
and
penny
were
relieved
to
see
that
the
ceremony
had
not
yet
started
the
guests
were
gathered
in
the
garden
the
minister
stood
waiting
musicians
were
in
their
places
but
the
bridal
party
had
not
appeared
we
just
in
time
salt
remarked
penny
observed
kippenberg
talking
with
one
of
the
ushers
even
from
a
distance
it
was
apparent
that
the
woman
had
lost
her
poise
her
hands
fluttered
nervously
as
she
conferred
with
the
young
man
and
a
worried
frown
puckered
her
eyebrows
something
seems
to
be
wrong
said
penny
i
wonder
what
is
causing
the
delay
before
salt
could
reply
the
usher
crossed
the
lawn
and
came
directly
toward
them
penny
and
salt
instantly
were
on
guard
thinking
that
he
had
been
sent
by
kippenberg
to
eject
them
from
the
grounds
but
although
the
young
man
paused
he
did
not
look
squarely
at
them
have
you
seen
atherwald
anywhere
he
questioned
the
bridegroom
salt
asked
in
astonishment
what
the
matter
is
he
missing
oh
no
sir
the
young
man
returned
stiffly
certainly
not
he
merely
went
away
for
a
moment
atherwald
came
over
on
the
same
boat
with
us
penny
volunteered
and
did
you
see
him
enter
the
house
no
he
spoke
to
one
of
the
servants
and
then
went
toward
the
garden
did
you
notice
which
path
he
took
i
believe
it
was
this
one
we
just
come
from
down
by
the
river
added
salt
we
did
see
him
there
the
only
person
we
met
was
an
old
gardener
the
usher
thanked
them
for
the
information
and
hurried
on
when
the
man
was
beyond
hearing
salt
turned
to
penny
saying
jubilantly
say
maybe
we
get
a
big
story
after
all
sylvia
kippenberg
jilted
at
the
altar
hot
stuff
are
you
jumping
to
swift
conclusions
salt
he
must
be
around
here
somewhere
it
always
serious
business
when
a
man
is
late
for
his
wedding
even
if
he
does
show
up
daughter
sylvia
may
take
offense
and
call
the
whole
thing
off
oh
you
too
hopeful
penny
laughed
he
probably
be
here
in
another
minute
i
do
believe
he
would
have
come
at
all
if
he
had
intended
to
slip
away
he
may
have
lost
his
nerve
at
the
last
minute
salt
insisted
atherwald
did
act
strangely
on
the
boat
penny
said
reflectively
and
then
that
message
he
received
he
may
have
sent
it
to
himself
as
an
excuse
for
getting
away
why
not
i
ca
see
any
reason
for
going
to
so
much
unnecessary
trouble
penny
argued
if
he
intended
to
jilt
miss
kippenberg
how
much
easier
it
would
have
been
not
to
come
here
at
all
well
let
see
what
we
can
learn
salt
suggested
their
interest
steadily
mounting
they
went
on
toward
the
house
and
stationed
themselves
where
they
could
see
advantageously
it
was
evident
by
this
time
that
the
guests
suspected
something
had
gone
amiss
significant
glances
were
exchanged
a
few
persons
looked
at
their
watches
and
all
eyes
focused
upon
kippenberg
who
tried
desperately
to
carry
off
an
embarrassing
situation
minutes
passed
the
crowd
became
increasingly
restless
finally
the
usher
returned
and
spoke
quietly
to
kippenberg
they
both
retired
to
the
house
it
looks
as
if
there
will
be
no
wedding
today
salt
declared
atherwald
has
been
located
i
wo
dare
use
the
story
unless
i
absolutely
certain
of
my
facts
penny
said
anxiously
we
get
them
never
fear
kippenberg
and
the
usher
had
stepped
into
the
breakfast
room
posting
penny
at
the
outside
door
salt
followed
the
couple
from
the
hallway
he
could
hear
their
conversation
distinctly
but
he
must
be
somewhere
on
the
grounds
the
matron
argued
i
ca
understand
it
myself
the
young
man
replied
disappearance
is
very
mysterious
to
say
the
least
several
persons
saw
him
arrive
here
and
everything
seemed
to
be
all
right
what
time
is
it
now
two
mrs
kippenberg
so
late
oh
this
is
dreadful
how
can
i
face
them
i
know
just
how
you
feel
the
young
man
said
with
sympathy
if
you
wish
i
will
explain
to
the
guests
no
no
this
will
disgrace
us
kippenberg
murmured
wait
until
i
have
talked
with
sylvia
she
turned
suddenly
and
reached
the
hall
door
before
salt
could
escape
her
eyes
blazed
with
wrath
as
she
faced
him
so
here
you
are
she
cried
furiously
how
dare
you
disregard
my
orders
i
will
have
no
reporters
on
the
grounds
i
only
a
photographer
salt
said
meekly
enough
sorry
to
intrude
but
i
been
assigned
to
get
a
picture
of
the
bride
it
wo
take
a
minute
indeed
it
wo
kippenberg
broke
in
her
voice
rising
higher
you
take
no
pictures
here
not
one
now
get
out
a
picture
might
be
better
than
a
story
that
the
bridegroom
had
skipped
out
salt
said
persuasively
why
you
you
kippenberg
face
became
fiery
red
she
choked
as
she
tried
to
speak
get
out
i
say
salt
did
not
retreat
instead
he
took
his
camera
from
his
pocket
just
one
picture
kippenberg
at
least
of
you
realizing
that
the
photographer
meant
to
take
it
whether
or
not
she
gave
permission
the
woman
suddenly
lost
all
control
over
her
temper
do
you
dare
she
cried
furiously
do
you
dare
whirling
about
she
seized
an
empty
plate
from
the
tall
stack
on
the
serving
table
hold
that
pose
chortled
salt
goading
her
on
the
woman
hurled
the
plate
straight
at
him
salt
gleefully
snapped
a
picture
and
dodged
the
plate
crashed
into
the
wall
behind
him
splintering
into
a
half
dozen
pieces
swell
action
picture
he
grinned
do
you
dare
try
to
use
it
screamed
kippenberg
i
telephone
your
editor
i
have
you
discharged
see
here
offered
the
usher
taking
out
his
wallet
i
give
you
ten
dollars
for
that
picture
salt
shook
his
head
still
smiling
broadly
the
sound
of
the
crash
had
brought
servants
running
to
the
scene
have
this
person
ejected
from
the
grounds
kippenberg
ordered
harshly
and
see
that
he
does
get
back
just
outside
the
house
penny
huddled
against
the
wall
trying
to
make
herself
as
inconspicuous
as
possible
she
had
heard
everything
as
salt
backed
out
the
door
he
did
not
glance
at
her
but
he
muttered
for
her
ears
alone
you
on
your
own
now
kid
i
be
waiting
at
the
drawbridge
an
instant
later
two
servants
seized
him
roughly
by
the
arms
and
escorted
him
down
the
walk
to
the
boat
landing
chapter
ring
of
white
penny
waited
anxiously
but
kippenberg
did
not
come
to
the
outside
door
nor
had
it
occurred
to
the
two
servants
that
the
girl
was
connected
in
any
way
with
the
photographer
on
my
own
she
repeated
to
herself
on
my
own
with
a
vengeance
salt
had
his
picture
and
it
was
up
to
her
to
get
a
good
story
until
now
she
had
depended
upon
his
guidance
with
all
support
withdrawn
she
suddenly
felt
uncertain
and
incompetent
penny
waited
a
few
minutes
before
gathering
sufficient
courage
to
enter
the
long
hallway
one
glance
assured
her
that
the
breakfast
room
was
deserted
kippenberg
probably
went
upstairs
to
talk
with
her
daughter
she
reasoned
i
like
to
hear
what
they
say
to
each
other
with
the
guests
assembled
in
the
garden
only
a
few
persons
lingered
in
the
house
no
one
paid
heed
to
penny
as
she
moved
noiselessly
up
the
spiral
stairway
a
bedroom
door
stood
slightly
ajar
hearing
a
low
murmur
of
voices
penny
paused
framed
against
the
leaded
windows
she
saw
sylvia
kippenberg
talking
with
her
mother
despite
a
face
the
girl
was
very
lovely
she
wore
a
long
flowing
gown
of
white
satin
and
the
flowers
at
the
neckline
were
outlined
with
real
pearls
her
net
veil
had
been
discarded
a
bouquet
of
flowers
lay
on
the
floor
how
could
grant
do
such
a
cruel
thing
penny
heard
her
sob
i
just
ca
believe
it
of
him
mother
surely
he
will
come
kippenberg
held
the
girl
in
her
arms
trying
to
comfort
her
it
is
nearly
three
now
sylvia
the
servants
have
searched
everywhere
a
man
of
his
type
is
worthy
of
you
but
i
love
him
mother
and
i
am
sure
he
loves
me
it
does
seem
possible
he
would
do
such
a
thing
without
a
word
of
explanation
he
will
explain
never
fear
kippenberg
said
grimly
but
now
we
must
think
what
has
to
be
done
the
guests
must
be
told
oh
mother
sylvia
went
into
another
paroxysm
of
crying
there
is
no
other
way
my
dear
leave
everything
to
me
before
penny
realized
that
the
interview
had
ended
kippenberg
stepped
out
into
the
hall
her
eyes
focused
hard
upon
the
girl
you
are
a
reporter
she
accused
harshly
i
remember
you
were
with
that
photographer
please
began
penny
i
tell
you
nothing
the
woman
cried
how
dare
you
intrude
in
my
home
and
go
about
listening
at
bedroom
doors
kippenberg
if
only
you
will
calm
yourself
i
may
be
able
to
help
you
help
me
the
woman
demanded
what
do
you
mean
i
may
be
able
to
give
you
a
clue
as
to
what
became
of
grant
atherwald
the
anger
faded
from
kippenberg
face
she
came
close
to
penny
grasping
her
arm
with
a
pressure
which
hurt
you
have
seen
him
tell
me
he
came
over
in
the
same
boat
how
long
ago
was
that
shortly
after
one
he
was
stopped
at
the
front
door
by
a
servant
who
handed
him
a
note
atherwald
read
it
and
walked
down
toward
the
garden
i
wonder
which
one
of
the
servants
spoke
to
him
it
was
at
the
front
door
you
say
yes
then
it
must
have
been
gregg
i
talk
with
him
forgetting
penny
kippenberg
hastened
down
the
stairway
she
jangled
a
bell
and
asked
that
the
manservant
be
sent
to
her
unnoticed
penny
lingered
to
hear
the
interview
the
man
came
into
the
room
you
sent
for
me
mrs
kippenberg
he
inquired
yes
gregg
you
were
at
the
door
when
atherwald
arrived
i
was
madam
i
understand
you
handed
him
a
note
which
he
read
yes
madam
who
gave
you
the
note
mrs
latch
the
cook
she
told
me
it
was
brought
to
the
kitchen
door
early
this
morning
by
a
most
disreputable
looking
boy
he
had
been
hired
to
deliver
it
for
another
person
i
suppose
yes
madam
the
boy
told
mrs
latch
that
the
message
came
from
a
friend
of
atherwald
and
should
be
given
to
him
as
soon
as
he
arrived
you
have
no
idea
what
the
note
contained
no
kippenberg
the
envelope
was
sealed
sensing
that
when
the
interview
ended
kippenberg
wrath
might
again
descend
upon
her
penny
decided
not
to
tempt
fate
while
the
woman
was
still
talking
with
the
servant
she
slipped
out
of
the
house
atherwald
might
have
had
that
note
sent
to
himself
but
i
doubt
it
she
told
herself
either
he
is
still
on
the
estate
or
the
boatman
would
have
had
to
take
him
back
across
the
river
she
walked
quickly
down
to
the
dock
and
was
elated
to
find
the
guest
launch
tied
up
there
the
boatman
answered
her
questions
readily
he
had
not
seen
grant
atherwald
since
early
in
the
afternoon
salt
was
the
only
person
he
had
taken
back
across
the
river
have
you
noticed
any
other
boat
leaving
the
estate
inquired
penny
boats
have
been
going
up
and
down
the
river
all
day
the
man
answered
with
a
shrug
i
did
notice
any
particular
one
penny
glanced
across
the
water
she
could
see
salt
perched
on
the
drawbridge
waiting
for
her
but
she
was
not
yet
ready
to
leave
the
estate
ignoring
his
shout
to
come
on
she
turned
and
walked
back
toward
the
house
deliberately
she
chose
the
same
path
which
she
and
salt
had
followed
earlier
in
the
afternoon
a
swift
walk
brought
her
to
the
forbidden
trail
with
the
barrier
sign
penny
glanced
around
to
be
certain
she
was
not
under
observation
then
she
stepped
boldly
over
the
wire
passing
the
place
where
she
and
salt
had
talked
with
the
gardener
she
noticed
his
trowel
lying
on
the
ground
there
was
no
evidence
that
he
had
done
any
work
however
all
along
the
path
flowering
shrubs
were
well
trimmed
and
tended
so
this
part
of
the
estate
is
fixed
up
penny
mused
it
much
nicer
than
the
other
section
in
my
opinion
i
wonder
why
that
gardener
told
so
many
lies
the
path
led
deeper
into
the
woods
rustic
benches
invited
one
to
linger
but
penny
walked
rapidly
onward
unexpectedly
she
came
to
a
little
clearing
and
saw
before
her
a
large
circular
pool
from
a
gap
in
the
trees
warm
sunshine
poured
down
upon
the
bed
of
flowers
which
flanked
the
cement
sides
making
a
circle
of
brilliant
color
so
this
is
where
the
path
leads
thought
penny
no
mystery
here
after
all
she
was
at
a
loss
to
understand
why
this
portion
of
the
estate
had
been
closed
to
visitors
for
certainly
it
was
the
most
beautiful
part
yet
there
was
a
quality
to
the
beauty
which
the
girl
did
not
like
as
she
stood
staring
at
the
pool
she
was
fully
aware
of
an
uneasy
feeling
which
had
taken
possession
of
her
it
was
almost
as
if
she
stood
in
the
presence
of
something
sinister
and
unknown
the
gentle
rustling
of
the
tree
leaves
the
cool
river
air
blowing
against
her
cheek
only
served
to
heighten
the
feeling
she
drew
closer
and
peered
down
into
the
blue
depths
of
the
pool
she
could
not
see
the
bottom
plainly
for
the
water
was
choked
with
a
tangle
of
feathery
plants
a
few
yellow
lilies
floated
on
the
surface
penny
absently
reached
out
to
pluck
one
but
as
the
stem
snapped
off
she
gave
a
little
scream
and
dropped
the
flower
she
had
seen
a
large
shadowy
form
slithering
through
the
water
beneath
her
penny
backed
a
step
away
from
the
pool
from
among
the
lily
pads
an
ugly
head
emerged
and
a
broad
snout
was
raised
above
the
surface
for
an
instant
powerful
jaws
opened
and
closed
revealing
jagged
teeth
set
in
deep
pits
an
alligator
penny
exclaimed
aloud
such
a
horrid
ugly
creature
and
to
think
i
nearly
put
my
hand
in
that
water
she
shivered
and
watched
the
movements
of
the
alligator
its
head
scooted
smoothly
over
the
water
for
a
short
distance
then
with
a
swish
of
its
tail
the
reptile
submerged
and
the
pool
was
as
placid
as
before
eight
feet
long
if
it
an
inch
estimated
penny
why
would
any
person
in
his
right
mind
keep
such
a
creature
here
why
it
dangerous
she
felt
enraged
thinking
how
close
she
had
come
to
touching
the
alligator
yet
justice
compelled
her
to
admit
that
she
had
only
herself
to
blame
deliberately
she
had
disregarded
the
warning
not
to
explore
the
forbidden
trail
the
kippenbergs
keep
nice
pets
she
thought
ironically
if
anyone
fell
into
that
pool
it
would
be
just
too
bad
now
that
her
curiosity
was
satisfied
penny
had
not
the
slightest
desire
to
linger
near
the
lily
pool
with
another
glance
down
into
the
murky
depths
she
turned
away
but
she
had
taken
less
than
a
dozen
steps
when
she
paused
her
attention
was
held
by
a
bright
and
shiny
object
which
lay
in
the
dust
at
her
feet
with
a
low
cry
of
surprise
she
reached
down
and
picked
up
a
plain
band
of
white
gold
obviously
it
was
a
wedding
ring
now
where
did
this
come
from
penny
turned
it
over
on
the
palm
of
her
hand
startled
thoughts
leaped
into
her
mind
she
felt
certain
grant
atherwald
had
taken
this
same
path
earlier
in
the
afternoon
it
was
logical
to
believe
that
the
ring
had
been
his
intended
for
sylvia
kippenberg
had
he
lost
the
band
accidentally
or
deliberately
thrown
it
away
slowly
penny
gaze
roved
to
the
lily
pond
she
noted
that
the
coping
was
so
low
that
one
who
walked
carelessly
might
easily
stumble
and
fall
into
the
water
it
made
her
shudder
to
think
of
such
a
gruesome
possibility
yet
she
could
not
avoid
giving
it
consideration
for
that
matter
grant
atherwald
might
have
been
lured
to
this
isolated
spot
the
mysterious
message
penny
delved
no
deeper
into
the
problem
for
suddenly
she
felt
someone
grasp
her
arms
with
a
terrified
cry
she
whirled
about
to
face
her
assailant
chapter
forbidden
a
wave
of
relief
surged
over
penny
as
she
saw
that
it
was
the
old
gardener
who
held
her
fast
oh
it
only
you
she
laughed
shakily
trying
to
pull
away
for
a
second
i
thought
the
bogey
man
had
me
for
sure
the
gardener
did
not
smile
did
i
tell
you
to
keep
away
from
here
he
demanded
giving
her
a
hard
shake
i
not
doing
any
penny
stammered
she
kept
her
hand
closed
over
the
white
gold
ring
so
that
the
old
man
would
not
see
what
she
had
found
i
just
wanted
to
learn
what
was
back
in
here
and
you
found
out
the
gardener
tone
warned
penny
to
be
cautious
in
her
reply
oh
the
pool
is
rather
pretty
she
answered
carelessly
but
i
seen
much
nicer
ones
how
long
have
you
been
here
only
a
minute
or
two
i
really
came
to
search
for
grant
atherwald
atherwald
what
would
he
be
doing
here
he
disappeared
an
hour
or
so
ago
revealed
penny
the
servants
have
been
searching
everywhere
for
him
he
disappeared
the
gardener
repeated
incredulously
yes
it
very
peculiar
atherwald
arrived
at
the
estate
in
ample
time
for
the
wedding
but
after
he
read
a
note
which
was
delivered
to
him
he
walked
off
in
this
direction
and
was
seen
no
more
down
this
path
you
mean
i
could
say
as
to
that
but
he
started
this
way
i
know
because
i
saw
him
myself
atherwald
did
come
here
the
gardener
said
with
finality
i
been
working
around
the
lily
pond
all
afternoon
and
would
have
seen
him
penny
fingers
closed
tightly
about
the
white
gold
ring
which
she
kept
shielded
from
the
man
gaze
in
her
opinion
the
trinket
offered
almost
conclusive
proof
that
the
bridegroom
had
visited
the
locality
because
she
could
not
trust
the
gardener
she
kept
her
thoughts
strictly
to
herself
the
man
stared
down
at
his
feet
obviously
disturbed
by
the
information
penny
had
given
him
do
you
suppose
harm
could
have
befallen
mr
atherwald
she
asked
after
a
moment
harm
he
demanded
irritably
that
sheer
nonsense
the
fellow
probably
skipped
out
he
ought
to
be
tarred
and
feathered
and
you
would
enjoy
doing
it
penny
interposed
slyly
the
gardener
glared
at
her
making
no
attempt
to
hide
his
dislike
such
treatment
would
be
too
good
for
anyone
who
hurt
miss
sylvia
now
will
you
get
out
of
here
i
have
my
orders
and
i
mean
to
enforce
them
oh
all
right
replied
penny
i
was
going
anyway
this
was
not
strictly
true
for
had
the
gardener
not
been
there
she
would
have
made
a
more
thorough
investigation
of
the
locality
near
the
lily
pool
but
now
she
had
no
hope
of
learning
more
and
so
turned
away
emerging
from
among
the
trees
she
glanced
toward
the
rose
garden
nearly
all
of
the
wedding
guests
had
departed
penny
considered
whether
or
not
she
should
speak
to
kippenberg
about
finding
the
ring
deciding
against
it
she
joined
a
group
of
people
at
the
boat
dock
and
was
ferried
across
the
river
salt
awaited
her
at
the
drawbridge
i
just
about
gave
you
up
he
complained
it
time
for
us
to
get
back
to
the
office
or
our
news
wo
be
news
the
wedding
is
definitely
off
yes
atherwald
ca
be
found
we
stop
at
a
drug
store
and
telephone
salt
said
pulling
her
toward
the
car
learn
anything
more
after
i
left
well
i
found
a
wedding
ring
and
was
nearly
chewed
up
by
an
alligator
laughed
penny
it
seemed
rather
interesting
at
the
time
the
photographer
gave
her
a
queer
look
as
he
started
the
automobile
imagination
and
journalism
never
mix
he
said
does
this
look
like
imagination
penny
countered
showing
him
the
plain
band
ring
where
did
you
find
it
beside
a
lily
pond
in
the
forbidden
part
of
the
estate
i
feel
certain
it
must
have
been
dropped
by
grant
atherwald
thrown
away
i
do
know
exactly
what
to
think
penny
replied
soberly
salt
steered
the
car
into
the
main
road
which
led
back
to
corbin
then
he
inquired
did
you
notice
any
signs
of
a
struggle
grass
trampled
footprints
i
did
have
a
chance
to
do
any
investigating
that
bossy
old
gardener
came
and
drove
me
away
what
were
you
saying
about
alligators
salt
i
saw
one
swimming
around
in
the
lily
pool
penny
told
him
earnestly
it
was
an
ugly
brute
at
least
twelve
feet
long
how
long
well
eight
anyway
you
joking
i
am
not
penny
said
indignantly
maybe
it
was
only
a
big
log
lying
in
the
water
penny
gave
an
injured
sniff
have
it
your
own
way
but
it
was
a
log
i
guess
i
can
tell
an
alligator
when
i
see
one
if
you
actually
right
salt
said
unmoved
i
like
to
have
snapped
a
picture
of
it
you
know
this
story
might
develop
into
something
big
i
have
a
feeling
it
will
salt
if
atherwald
really
has
disappeared
it
should
create
a
sensation
and
if
the
poor
fellow
had
the
misfortune
to
fall
or
be
pushed
into
the
lily
pool
dad
would
have
headlines
large
enough
to
carry
it
say
get
a
grip
on
yourself
salt
advised
the
prints
fact
not
fancy
that
because
so
many
of
dad
reporters
are
stodgy
old
fellows
laughed
penny
but
i
admit
it
is
very
likely
grant
atherwald
was
devoured
by
the
alligator
the
car
had
reached
corbin
salt
drew
up
in
front
of
a
drug
store
run
in
and
telephone
dewitt
he
said
opening
the
door
for
her
and
remember
stick
to
facts
penny
was
a
little
frightened
as
she
entered
the
telephone
booth
and
placed
a
long
distance
call
to
the
she
never
failed
to
feel
nervous
when
she
talked
with
dewitt
the
city
editor
for
he
was
not
a
very
pleasant
individual
she
jumped
as
the
receiver
was
taken
down
and
a
voice
barked
city
desk
this
is
penny
parker
over
at
corbin
she
began
weakly
ca
hear
you
snapped
dewitt
talk
up
penny
repeated
her
name
and
dewitt
voice
lost
some
of
its
edge
gathering
courage
she
started
to
tell
him
what
she
had
learned
at
the
kippenberg
estate
hold
it
interrupted
dewitt
i
switch
you
over
to
a
rewrite
man
the
connection
was
made
and
penny
began
a
second
time
now
and
then
the
rewrite
man
broke
into
the
narrative
to
ask
a
question
all
right
i
think
i
have
it
all
he
said
finally
and
hung
up
penny
went
back
to
the
car
looking
as
crestfallen
as
she
felt
i
do
know
what
they
thought
of
the
story
she
told
salt
dewitt
certainly
did
waste
any
words
of
praise
he
never
does
chuckled
the
photographer
you
lucky
if
you
get
fired
that
one
consolation
returned
penny
settling
herself
for
the
long
ride
home
he
ca
fire
me
being
the
editor
daughter
has
its
advantages
the
regular
night
edition
of
the
was
on
the
street
by
the
time
they
reached
the
city
salt
signaled
a
newsboy
and
bought
a
paper
while
the
car
waited
for
a
traffic
light
he
tossed
it
over
to
penny
here
it
is
my
story
she
cried
and
then
her
face
fell
what
the
matter
asked
salt
did
they
garble
it
all
up
they
cut
it
down
to
three
inches
and
not
a
word
about
the
alligator
or
the
lost
wedding
ring
i
could
cry
why
i
told
that
rewrite
man
enough
to
fill
at
least
a
column
well
anyway
you
made
the
front
page
the
photographer
consoled
they
may
build
the
story
up
in
the
next
edition
after
they
get
my
pictures
penny
said
nothing
remaining
in
deep
gloom
during
the
remainder
of
the
ride
to
the
office
salt
let
her
out
at
the
front
door
she
debated
for
a
moment
whether
or
not
to
go
on
home
but
finally
entered
the
building
dewitt
was
busy
at
his
desk
as
she
walked
stiffly
past
she
hoped
that
he
would
notice
how
she
ignored
him
but
he
did
not
glance
up
from
the
copy
before
him
penny
opened
the
door
of
her
father
private
office
and
stopped
short
why
dad
she
cried
what
are
you
doing
here
you
supposed
to
be
home
in
bed
i
finally
persuaded
the
doctor
to
let
me
out
anthony
parker
replied
swinging
around
in
his
swivel
chair
how
did
you
get
along
with
your
assignment
i
thought
i
did
very
well
penny
said
aloofly
but
from
now
on
not
telephone
anything
in
i
write
the
story
myself
now
do
blame
dewitt
or
the
rewrite
man
said
parker
smiling
a
paper
has
to
be
careful
in
what
it
publishes
especially
about
a
wedding
alligators
are
a
bit
too
shall
we
say
sensational
you
made
a
similar
remark
about
witch
dolls
penny
reminded
him
i
did
eat
my
words
that
time
parker
admitted
but
this
is
different
if
we
build
up
a
big
story
about
grant
disappearance
and
then
tomorrow
he
shows
up
at
his
own
home
appear
pretty
ridiculous
i
guess
you
right
penny
said
turning
away
well
i
happy
to
see
you
back
in
the
office
again
parker
watched
her
speculatively
when
she
reached
the
door
he
inquired
are
you
forgetting
something
what
dad
today
is
thursday
the
editor
took
a
sealed
envelope
from
the
desk
drawer
this
is
the
first
time
you
have
failed
to
collect
your
allowance
in
over
a
year
i
must
be
slipping
penny
grinned
as
she
pocketed
the
envelope
why
do
you
open
it
what
the
use
penny
asked
gloomily
it
always
the
same
anyway
i
borrowed
two
dollars
last
week
so
this
does
really
belong
to
me
you
might
be
pleasantly
surprised
penny
stared
at
her
father
with
disbelief
dad
you
do
mean
given
me
a
raise
eagerly
she
ripped
open
the
envelope
three
crisp
dollar
bills
fluttered
into
her
hand
with
a
shriek
of
delight
penny
flung
her
arms
about
her
father
neck
i
always
try
to
reward
a
good
reporter
he
chuckled
now
take
yourself
off
because
my
work
is
stacked
a
mile
high
penny
tripped
gaily
toward
the
door
but
it
opened
before
she
could
cross
the
room
an
office
boy
came
in
with
a
message
for
parker
man
to
see
you
named
atherwald
he
announced
the
name
produced
an
electrifying
effect
upon
both
penny
and
her
father
atherwald
parker
exclaimed
then
he
has
disappeared
after
all
show
him
in
and
i
staying
right
here
penny
declared
easing
herself
into
the
nearest
chair
i
have
a
hunch
that
this
interview
may
concern
me
chapter
in
a
few
minutes
the
office
boy
returned
followed
by
a
distinguished
man
who
carried
a
cane
penny
gave
him
an
astonished
glance
for
she
had
expected
to
see
grant
atherwald
it
had
not
occurred
to
her
that
there
might
be
two
persons
with
the
same
surname
mr
atherwald
inquired
her
father
waving
the
visitor
into
a
chair
james
atherwald
the
man
spoke
shortly
and
did
not
sit
down
instead
he
spread
out
a
copy
of
the
night
edition
of
the
and
pointed
to
the
story
which
penny
had
covered
she
quaked
inwardly
wondering
what
error
of
hers
was
to
be
exposed
do
you
see
this
atherwald
demanded
what
about
it
inquired
the
editor
pleasantly
you
are
holding
my
family
up
to
ridicule
by
printing
such
a
story
grant
atherwald
is
my
son
is
the
story
incorrect
yes
you
imply
that
my
son
deliberately
jilted
sylvia
kippenberg
and
actually
he
did
parker
inquired
evenly
certainly
not
my
son
is
a
man
of
honor
and
had
a
very
deep
regard
for
sylvia
under
no
circumstance
would
he
have
jilted
her
still
the
wedding
did
not
take
place
that
is
true
atherwald
admitted
perhaps
you
can
explain
why
it
was
postponed
i
do
know
what
happened
to
grant
atherwald
said
reluctantly
he
left
our
home
in
ample
time
for
the
ceremony
and
i
might
add
was
in
excellent
spirits
i
believe
he
must
have
been
the
victim
of
a
stupid
practical
joke
well
that
suggests
a
new
angle
parker
remarked
thoughtfully
did
your
son
have
friends
who
might
be
apt
to
play
such
a
joke
on
him
no
one
of
my
acquaintance
atherwald
answered
unwillingly
of
course
he
had
many
young
friends
who
were
not
in
my
circle
penny
had
listened
quietly
to
the
conversation
she
now
arose
and
came
over
to
the
desk
from
her
pocket
she
took
the
white
gold
wedding
ring
atherwald
she
said
i
wonder
if
you
could
identify
this
the
man
studied
the
trinket
for
a
moment
it
looks
very
much
like
a
ring
which
grant
purchased
for
sylvia
he
declared
where
did
you
get
it
i
found
it
lying
on
the
ground
at
the
kippenberg
estate
penny
replied
vaguely
she
had
no
intention
of
divulging
the
exact
locality
where
she
had
picked
up
the
ring
you
see
said
parker
we
have
supporting
facts
in
our
possession
which
were
not
published
all
in
all
i
think
the
story
was
handled
discreetly
with
due
regard
for
the
feelings
of
those
involved
then
you
refuse
to
retract
the
story
i
should
like
to
oblige
you
atherwald
but
you
realize
such
a
story
as
this
is
of
great
interest
to
our
readers
you
care
only
for
sensationalism
on
the
contrary
we
try
to
avoid
it
parker
corrected
in
this
particular
case
we
deliberately
played
the
story
down
if
it
develops
that
your
son
actually
has
disappeared
i
tell
you
it
was
only
a
practical
joke
atherwald
interrupted
no
doubt
my
son
is
at
home
by
this
time
the
wedding
has
merely
been
postponed
you
are
entitled
to
your
opinion
said
parker
and
i
sincerely
hope
that
you
are
right
at
least
do
not
use
that
picture
which
your
photographer
took
of
kippenberg
i
pay
you
for
it
parker
smiled
and
shook
his
head
i
might
have
expected
such
an
attitude
atherwald
exclaimed
angrily
good
afternoon
he
left
the
office
slamming
the
door
behind
him
well
you
lost
another
subscriber
dad
said
penny
flippantly
he
not
the
first
returned
her
father
i
intended
to
give
atherwald
the
wedding
ring
but
he
went
off
in
too
big
a
hurry
should
i
go
after
him
no
do
bother
penny
you
might
take
it
around
to
the
picture
room
and
have
it
photographed
we
may
use
it
as
exhibit
a
if
the
story
develops
into
anything
how
about
the
alligator
penny
asked
would
you
like
to
have
me
bring
that
to
the
office
too
move
out
of
here
and
let
me
work
her
father
retorted
penny
went
to
the
photographic
department
and
made
her
requirements
known
i
wait
for
the
ring
she
announced
you
do
catch
me
trusting
you
boys
with
any
jewelry
while
the
picture
was
being
taken
salt
came
by
with
several
damp
prints
in
his
hand
take
a
look
at
this
one
penny
he
said
proudly
kippenberg
wielding
a
wicked
plate
will
she
burn
up
when
she
sees
it
on
the
picture
page
she
will
indeed
agreed
penny
nice
going
when
the
ring
had
been
returned
to
her
she
slipped
it
into
her
pocket
and
left
the
newspaper
office
her
next
stop
was
at
a
corner
hamburger
shop
where
she
fortified
herself
with
two
large
sandwiches
that
ought
to
hold
me
until
the
dinner
bell
rings
she
thought
and
now
to
pay
my
honest
debts
a
trolley
ride
and
a
short
walk
brought
penny
to
the
home
of
her
chum
louise
sidell
as
she
came
within
sight
of
the
front
porch
she
saw
her
friend
sitting
on
the
steps
reading
a
movie
magazine
louise
threw
it
aside
and
sprang
to
her
feet
oh
penny
i
glad
you
came
over
i
telephoned
your
house
and
weems
said
you
had
gone
away
somewhere
official
business
for
dad
penny
laughed
she
dropped
two
dollars
into
louise
hand
here
what
i
owe
you
but
do
go
spend
it
because
i
may
need
to
borrow
it
back
in
a
couple
of
days
is
leaping
lena
running
up
huge
garage
bills
again
louise
inquired
sympathetically
penny
car
was
a
joke
to
everyone
save
herself
she
was
a
familiar
figure
at
nearly
every
garage
in
riverview
for
the
vehicle
had
a
disconcerting
way
of
breaking
down
i
had
to
buy
new
spark
plugs
this
time
sighed
penny
but
then
i
should
get
along
better
from
now
on
dad
raised
my
allowance
does
that
call
for
a
celebration
rini
have
a
special
on
today
a
double
chocolate
sundae
with
pineapple
and
nuts
cherry
and
oh
no
you
do
i
saving
my
dollar
for
the
essentials
of
life
i
may
need
it
for
gasoline
if
i
decide
to
drive
over
to
corbin
again
again
louise
asked
alertly
i
was
over
there
today
covering
the
kippenberg
wedding
penny
explained
only
it
turned
out
there
was
no
ceremony
grant
atherwald
jilted
his
bride
or
was
spirited
away
by
persons
unknown
he
was
last
seen
near
a
lily
pool
in
an
isolated
part
of
the
estate
i
picked
up
a
wedding
ring
lying
on
the
ground
close
by
and
then
as
a
climax
kippenberg
hurled
a
plate
at
salt
penny
parker
what
are
you
saying
louise
demanded
it
sounds
like
one
of
those
thrillers
they
show
over
at
the
rialto
here
is
the
evidence
penny
said
showing
her
the
white
gold
ring
it
amazing
how
you
get
into
so
much
adventure
louise
replied
enviously
as
she
studied
the
trinket
start
at
the
beginning
and
tell
me
everything
the
invitation
was
very
much
to
penny
liking
perching
herself
on
the
highest
porch
step
she
recounted
her
visit
to
the
kippenberg
estate
painting
an
especially
romantic
picture
of
the
castle
dwelling
the
moat
and
the
drawbridge
oh
i
love
to
visit
the
place
louise
declared
you
have
all
the
luck
i
take
you
with
me
if
i
ever
get
to
go
again
promised
penny
well
i
see
you
tomorrow
and
with
this
careless
farewell
she
sprang
to
her
feet
and
hastened
on
home
the
next
morning
while
weems
was
preparing
breakfast
penny
ran
down
to
the
corner
to
buy
the
first
edition
of
the
as
she
spread
it
open
a
small
headline
accosted
her
eye
no
trace
of
missing
bridegroom
penny
read
swiftly
learning
that
grant
atherwald
had
not
been
seen
since
his
strange
disappearance
from
the
kippenberg
estate
members
of
the
family
refused
to
discuss
the
affair
and
had
made
no
report
to
the
police
this
story
is
developing
into
something
big
after
all
she
thought
with
quickening
pulse
now
if
dad
will
only
let
me
work
on
it
at
home
she
gave
the
newspaper
to
her
father
remarking
rather
pointedly
you
see
your
expert
reporters
have
learned
very
much
more
than
i
brought
in
yesterday
why
would
it
be
a
good
idea
to
send
me
out
there
again
today
oh
i
doubt
if
you
could
get
into
the
estate
penny
salt
and
i
managed
yesterday
you
did
very
well
but
you
were
known
then
it
will
be
a
different
matter
today
since
we
antagonized
the
family
by
using
the
story
suggest
that
jerry
livingston
be
assigned
to
it
with
penny
as
first
assistant
parker
smiled
and
shook
his
head
this
is
your
type
of
story
now
if
you
would
like
to
cover
a
lecture
at
the
women
club
or
a
nice
peppy
meeting
of
the
ladies
sewing
circle
penny
finished
ironically
thank
you
no
i
am
sure
you
would
have
a
chance
of
getting
into
the
estate
her
father
said
lamely
we
must
have
good
coverage
what
does
jerry
have
that
i
have
got
penny
demanded
in
an
aggrieved
voice
eight
years
of
experience
for
one
thing
but
i
really
should
go
out
there
penny
insisted
i
ought
to
show
miss
kippenberg
the
ring
i
found
the
ring
might
provide
an
entry
parker
admitted
thoughtfully
i
tell
you
why
do
you
telephone
long
distance
and
if
i
able
to
make
an
appointment
may
i
help
jerry
cover
the
story
all
right
agreed
parker
if
sylvia
kippenberg
talks
with
you
we
be
able
to
use
anything
she
says
i
the
same
as
on
my
way
to
the
estate
now
dad
with
a
triumphant
laugh
penny
left
the
breakfast
table
and
hastened
to
the
telephone
long
distance
she
said
into
the
transmitter
the
kippenberg
estate
at
corbin
please
she
hovered
anxiously
near
the
telephone
while
she
waited
for
the
connection
to
be
made
ten
minutes
elapsed
before
the
bell
jingled
several
times
eagerly
she
jerked
down
the
receiver
she
could
hear
a
faint
voice
saying
hello
may
i
speak
with
sylvia
kippenberg
penny
requested
who
is
this
please
miss
parker
at
riverview
miss
kippenberg
is
not
at
home
came
the
stiff
response
then
let
me
speak
with
kippenberg
penny
said
quickly
i
have
something
very
important
to
tell
her
yesterday
when
i
was
at
the
estate
i
found
a
ring
the
receiver
had
clicked
at
the
other
end
of
the
line
the
connection
was
broken
chapter
society
you
see
penny
said
parker
sympathetically
wealthy
people
have
a
way
of
being
inaccessible
to
the
press
they
surround
themselves
with
servants
who
have
been
trained
to
allow
no
invasion
of
their
privacy
they
erect
barriers
which
are
easily
broken
down
if
only
i
could
have
reached
miss
kippenberg
i
feel
sure
she
would
have
wished
to
learn
about
the
ring
returned
penny
oh
well
let
jerry
cover
the
story
i
lost
interest
all
that
morning
the
girl
went
about
the
house
in
a
mood
of
deep
depression
she
felt
completely
out
of
sorts
and
would
scowl
at
her
own
reflection
whenever
she
passed
a
mirror
nothing
seemed
to
go
right
i
declare
i
wish
you
would
forget
that
silly
wedding
weems
said
wearily
why
do
you
try
working
out
your
resentment
on
a
tennis
ball
not
a
bad
idea
admitted
penny
only
i
have
no
partner
louise
is
going
away
somewhere
today
to
a
charity
bazaar
here
in
riverview
inquired
weems
with
interest
no
it
to
be
held
at
andover
twenty
miles
from
corbin
louise
is
going
with
an
aunt
of
hers
she
invited
me
several
days
ago
but
i
think
it
would
be
any
fun
you
might
enjoy
it
why
do
you
go
i
wonder
if
it
is
too
late
penny
glanced
at
the
clock
a
telephone
call
to
the
sidell
home
assured
her
that
she
would
have
ample
time
to
get
ready
for
the
trip
she
quickly
dressed
and
was
waiting
when
louise
and
her
aunt
miss
lucinda
frome
drove
up
to
the
door
what
sort
of
an
affair
is
it
penny
inquired
as
they
traveled
toward
the
distant
town
miss
frome
explained
that
the
bazaar
was
being
sponsored
by
members
of
the
organization
and
would
be
held
at
one
of
the
fashionable
clubs
of
the
city
as
miss
frome
belonged
to
the
riverview
chapter
she
and
her
guests
would
have
an
entry
i
look
forward
to
meeting
a
number
of
prominent
persons
today
the
woman
declared
the
andover
chapter
has
a
very
exclusive
membership
louise
winked
at
penny
for
it
was
a
source
of
amusement
to
her
that
her
aunt
stood
in
awe
of
society
personages
neither
she
nor
her
chum
suffered
from
social
ambition
or
a
feeling
of
inferiority
at
andover
miss
frome
drove
the
car
to
the
city
club
and
parked
it
beside
a
long
row
of
other
automobiles
many
of
which
were
under
the
charge
of
uniformed
chauffeurs
oh
dear
remarked
miss
frome
nervously
i
did
realize
how
shabby
my
old
coupe
looks
i
do
hope
no
one
notices
now
do
start
that
aunty
louise
said
taking
her
by
the
arm
your
car
is
perfectly
all
right
and
so
are
you
they
went
up
the
steps
of
the
stone
building
and
mingled
with
the
other
women
so
many
persons
were
present
that
the
three
newcomers
attracted
no
attention
miss
frome
was
reassured
to
see
that
she
was
as
well
dressed
as
anyone
in
the
room
several
long
tables
were
covered
with
various
articles
offered
for
sale
penny
and
louise
wandered
about
examining
objects
which
struck
their
fancy
miss
frome
bought
a
vase
and
an
imitation
ivory
elephant
but
the
girls
considered
the
prices
too
high
for
their
purses
presently
penny
gaze
was
drawn
to
a
young
woman
who
stood
behind
one
of
the
tables
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
she
stopped
short
and
stared
see
someone
you
know
inquired
louise
why
that
young
woman
with
the
dark
hair
and
the
lace
dress
louise
she
is
sylvia
kippenberg
really
i
must
say
she
has
courage
to
come
here
today
after
all
that
happened
the
young
woman
did
not
realize
that
she
was
being
subjected
to
scrutiny
however
she
seemed
fully
aware
that
she
was
a
general
object
of
curiosity
for
her
lips
were
frozen
in
a
set
smile
and
her
face
was
pale
despite
the
rouge
on
the
smooth
cheeks
i
suppose
she
must
be
on
the
bazaar
committee
louise
went
on
but
my
if
anyone
had
jilted
me
i
would
not
have
come
here
today
jerry
must
have
missed
his
interview
after
all
penny
murmured
half
to
herself
jerry
yes
dad
assigned
him
to
the
kippenberg
story
i
suppose
he
drove
to
corbin
today
in
the
hope
of
seeing
miss
sylvia
and
she
may
have
come
here
just
to
escape
reporters
for
two
cents
i
try
to
interview
her
myself
penny
said
do
you
think
she
would
talk
with
you
not
if
she
realizes
i
am
a
reporter
but
at
least
i
can
try
do
create
a
scene
whatever
you
do
louise
warned
uneasily
not
that
i
would
mind
but
aunt
lucinda
would
die
of
mortification
i
try
to
be
careful
penny
promised
she
sauntered
forward
gradually
working
toward
the
table
where
the
young
woman
served
selecting
an
article
at
random
from
the
display
she
inquired
its
price
ten
dollars
miss
kippenberg
answered
mechanically
penny
loitered
at
the
table
until
two
elderly
women
had
moved
on
she
was
now
alone
with
sylvia
kippenberg
she
would
have
no
better
opportunity
to
speak
with
her
miss
kippenberg
she
began
yes
the
young
woman
really
gazed
at
the
girl
for
the
first
time
penny
saw
that
her
eyelids
were
red
and
swollen
from
recent
tears
i
should
like
to
talk
with
you
alone
please
do
i
know
your
name
miss
kippenberg
asked
coldly
penny
parker
parker
parker
the
young
woman
repeated
and
her
eyes
hardened
oh
yes
you
are
the
girl
who
came
to
our
place
yesterday
with
that
photographer
and
you
telephoned
again
this
morning
yes
penny
admitted
reluctantly
but
the
young
woman
did
not
allow
her
to
finish
i
not
talk
with
you
or
any
other
reporter
you
have
no
right
to
come
here
and
annoy
me
please
i
not
really
a
reporter
miss
kippenberg
i
have
something
to
show
you
miss
kippenberg
had
closed
her
ears
to
penny
words
she
turned
abruptly
and
fled
in
the
direction
of
the
powder
room
penny
hesitated
remembering
her
promise
to
create
no
scene
still
she
could
not
allow
miss
kippenberg
to
elude
her
so
easily
determinedly
she
followed
please
miss
kippenberg
you
must
listen
to
me
she
pleaded
observing
that
her
words
had
not
the
slightest
effect
upon
the
girl
she
suddenly
opened
her
purse
and
took
out
the
white
gold
ring
she
thrust
it
in
front
of
miss
kippenberg
i
only
wish
to
show
you
this
the
young
woman
stopped
short
gazing
down
at
the
ring
where
did
you
get
it
she
asked
in
a
low
tone
then
you
do
recognize
it
of
course
grant
showed
it
to
me
the
night
before
we
were
to
have
been
married
tell
me
how
did
it
come
into
your
hands
we
ca
talk
here
miss
kippenberg
glanced
quickly
about
and
observing
that
many
eyes
were
focused
upon
them
led
the
girl
into
the
deserted
powder
room
they
sat
down
on
a
sofa
in
a
secluded
corner
i
did
mean
to
be
so
rude
before
miss
kippenberg
apologized
it
was
only
because
i
must
protect
myself
from
reporters
and
photographers
you
have
no
idea
how
i
have
been
annoyed
i
do
understand
said
penny
and
i
wish
to
help
you
that
was
why
i
was
so
insistent
upon
talking
with
you
i
think
this
ring
may
be
a
clue
to
atherwald
disappearance
then
you
believe
as
i
do
that
he
did
not
go
away
purposely
my
theory
is
that
atherwald
was
a
victim
of
a
plot
did
he
have
any
known
enemies
oh
no
everyone
liked
grant
tell
me
about
the
ring
who
gave
it
to
you
no
one
i
found
it
while
i
was
exploring
a
path
on
the
estate
the
trail
which
is
blocked
off
you
should
have
gone
there
but
no
matter
just
where
did
you
pick
up
the
ring
i
found
it
near
the
lily
pool
miss
kippenberg
stared
at
penny
with
expressionless
eyes
oh
she
murmured
her
head
dropped
low
her
body
sagged
and
she
slumped
down
on
the
sofa
in
a
faint
chapter
thrown
penny
first
thought
was
to
call
for
assistance
but
sober
reflection
made
her
realize
that
to
do
so
would
likely
result
in
awkward
questions
she
felt
certain
miss
kippenberg
had
only
fainted
and
would
soon
revive
stretching
the
young
woman
full
length
upon
the
sofa
the
girl
ran
to
the
washroom
for
a
glass
of
water
she
dampened
a
towel
and
folded
it
across
miss
kippenberg
forehead
at
the
same
time
rubbing
the
limp
hands
and
trying
to
restore
circulation
noticing
the
white
gold
ring
which
had
fallen
to
the
floor
she
reached
down
and
picked
it
up
miss
kippenberg
must
have
fainted
because
of
what
i
told
her
about
the
lily
pond
thought
penny
i
should
have
used
more
tact
she
watched
the
young
woman
anxiously
fearing
that
what
she
had
assumed
to
be
an
ordinary
faint
might
really
be
a
heart
attack
a
wave
of
relief
surged
over
her
as
miss
kippenberg
stirred
slightly
her
long
dark
eyelashes
fluttered
open
and
she
stared
blankly
about
her
where
am
i
she
asked
moistening
her
dry
lips
here
drink
this
penny
urged
offering
the
glass
of
water
feel
much
better
in
a
few
minutes
now
i
remember
miss
kippenberg
murmured
you
were
saying
do
think
about
that
now
just
lie
still
and
relax
miss
kippenberg
did
not
try
to
speak
again
for
some
little
time
then
despite
penny
protests
she
raised
herself
to
a
sitting
position
i
feel
quite
all
right
now
she
insisted
how
stupid
of
me
to
faint
i
am
afraid
i
was
very
tactless
on
the
contrary
our
conversation
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
i
thought
it
was
the
heat
miss
kippenberg
insisted
i
had
a
sunstroke
once
and
since
then
i
ca
bear
even
an
overheated
room
but
it
really
is
very
warm
in
here
protested
penny
i
do
notice
it
at
all
you
might
not
but
i
am
very
sensitive
to
it
well
i
glad
your
faint
was
caused
by
anything
i
said
penny
declared
although
she
continued
to
regard
the
young
woman
dubiously
i
thought
you
seemed
shocked
by
what
i
told
you
about
the
ring
you
were
saying
that
you
picked
it
up
near
the
lily
pond
miss
kippenberg
questioned
in
a
low
tone
yes
replied
penny
watching
her
closely
i
wish
i
knew
the
exact
place
if
we
could
go
to
your
estate
together
i
could
show
you
penny
said
eagerly
miss
kippenberg
hesitated
in
her
reply
obviously
still
prejudiced
against
the
girl
because
of
her
connection
with
the
very
well
she
agreed
will
you
please
ask
that
my
car
be
sent
to
the
door
gladly
said
penny
trying
not
to
show
her
jubilance
leaving
miss
kippenberg
in
the
powder
room
she
returned
to
the
main
hall
louise
separated
from
the
crowd
and
hurried
to
meet
her
oh
penny
i
saw
you
go
off
with
miss
kippenberg
she
began
would
she
talk
with
you
she
did
answered
penny
and
now
i
going
with
her
to
the
estate
but
aunt
lucinda
expects
to
start
home
in
a
few
minutes
protested
louise
how
long
will
you
be
gone
i
have
the
slightest
idea
if
i
not
back
here
by
the
time
you
are
ready
to
leave
do
wait
for
me
but
how
will
you
get
home
oh
i
find
a
way
the
important
thing
now
is
to
learn
everything
i
can
from
miss
kippenberg
she
in
a
mood
to
talk
i
love
to
visit
the
estate
louise
said
wistfully
i
wish
i
could
take
you
penny
told
her
sincerely
but
i
do
see
how
i
can
this
time
of
course
not
penny
it
would
be
very
foolish
of
you
to
try
you
might
lose
your
own
chance
to
gain
an
exclusive
news
story
will
you
explain
to
your
aunt
about
my
sudden
disappearance
yes
she
understand
louise
replied
we
wait
here
for
you
at
least
an
hour
penny
left
a
call
for
miss
kippenberg
car
and
then
went
back
to
the
powder
room
the
young
woman
walked
a
bit
unsteadily
even
with
aid
however
no
one
paid
attention
to
them
as
they
crossed
the
main
hall
and
made
their
way
to
the
waiting
automobile
with
penny
and
miss
kippenberg
as
passengers
the
big
limousine
rolled
away
from
the
clubhouse
and
sped
toward
corbin
during
the
ride
the
young
woman
scarcely
spoke
she
sat
with
her
head
against
the
cushion
eyes
half
closed
as
they
came
within
view
of
the
drawbridge
she
made
an
effort
to
arouse
herself
i
see
you
have
visitors
at
the
estate
penny
commented
noticing
a
number
of
cars
parked
near
the
river
edge
reporters
always
reporters
returned
miss
kippenberg
impatiently
they
may
try
to
board
as
we
pass
penny
wondered
how
the
limousine
would
be
taken
across
the
river
the
old
watchman
had
noted
their
approach
before
the
car
reached
the
end
of
the
road
he
had
lowered
the
creaking
drawbridge
into
position
is
the
bridge
really
safe
penny
inquired
of
her
companion
for
light
traffic
only
miss
kippenberg
answered
briefly
the
arrival
of
the
car
had
created
a
stir
of
interest
among
the
group
of
men
gathered
near
the
bridge
penny
caught
sight
of
jerry
livingston
and
could
not
resist
rolling
down
the
side
window
so
he
would
be
sure
to
obtain
a
clear
view
of
her
it
gave
her
a
very
pleasant
feeling
to
see
him
stare
as
if
he
could
not
believe
his
own
eyes
several
of
the
reporters
attempted
to
stop
the
limousine
but
without
success
the
car
clattered
over
the
drawbridge
which
was
pulled
up
again
before
anyone
could
follow
penny
and
miss
kippenberg
alighted
at
the
front
door
of
the
great
house
now
show
me
where
you
found
the
ring
requested
the
young
woman
penny
led
her
down
the
winding
path
into
the
grove
i
hope
we
do
meet
your
head
gardener
she
said
significantly
he
seems
to
be
such
an
unpleasant
individual
miss
kippenberg
glanced
at
her
queerly
why
how
do
you
mean
oh
yesterday
he
ordered
me
away
from
here
in
no
uncertain
terms
he
only
meant
to
do
his
duty
then
the
man
has
been
ordered
to
keep
persons
away
from
this
part
of
the
estate
i
really
could
tell
you
miss
kippenberg
answered
aloofly
mother
has
charge
of
the
servants
has
the
man
been
in
your
employ
long
i
ca
tell
you
that
either
miss
kippenberg
voice
warned
penny
that
she
did
not
care
to
be
questioned
there
was
no
sign
of
the
old
gardener
as
they
came
presently
to
the
lily
pool
penny
searched
about
in
the
grass
for
a
few
minutes
here
is
where
i
found
the
ring
she
revealed
and
see
this
what
miss
kippenberg
drew
in
her
breath
sharply
footprints
that
does
seem
so
remarkable
the
young
woman
bent
to
examine
them
they
probably
were
made
by
grant
own
shoe
but
it
looks
as
if
there
might
have
been
a
struggle
here
penny
insisted
from
those
marks
would
you
say
a
body
had
been
dragged
across
the
ground
toward
the
pool
no
cried
miss
kippenberg
the
grass
is
trampled
but
i
ca
believe
grant
has
met
with
violence
i
refuse
to
think
of
such
a
thing
the
pool
she
broke
off
and
a
shudder
wracked
her
body
it
is
best
to
know
the
truth
have
you
notified
the
police
about
atherwald
disappearance
miss
kippenberg
shook
her
head
until
today
i
thought
he
would
return
or
at
least
i
hoped
so
it
seems
to
me
an
expert
should
be
called
into
the
case
penny
urged
why
do
you
telephone
the
police
station
now
i
could
returned
sylvia
looking
very
miserable
not
without
consulting
mother
then
let
talk
with
her
now
she
is
at
home
this
afternoon
but
something
should
be
done
and
at
once
penny
protested
the
first
rain
will
destroy
all
these
footprints
and
perhaps
other
important
evidence
do
you
really
love
grant
atherwald
with
all
my
heart
answered
the
young
woman
soberly
then
i
should
think
you
would
have
some
interest
in
what
became
of
him
i
ca
understand
your
attitude
at
all
i
i
have
others
to
think
of
besides
myself
your
mother
you
mean
yes
sylvia
avoided
penny
penetrating
gaze
surely
your
mother
would
wish
an
act
of
violence
to
go
unpunished
so
much
time
has
been
lost
already
we
are
certain
anything
has
happened
to
grant
sylvia
responded
her
eyes
downcast
if
we
should
bring
the
police
into
the
case
and
then
it
turns
out
that
he
has
merely
gone
away
to
some
other
city
i
be
held
up
to
ridicule
once
more
it
seems
to
me
you
are
taking
a
most
foolish
attitude
there
is
another
reason
why
we
must
be
very
careful
sylvia
said
unwillingly
and
what
is
that
for
just
an
instant
penny
dared
hope
that
the
young
woman
meant
to
answer
the
question
but
sylvia
seemed
to
reconsider
for
she
said
quickly
i
ca
tell
you
please
do
ask
me
any
more
questions
are
you
afraid
you
may
be
blamed
for
atherwald
disappearance
penny
persisted
no
no
i
assure
you
i
am
not
thinking
of
myself
please
let
return
to
the
house
penny
deliberately
blocked
the
path
unless
you
wish
me
to
notify
the
police
there
is
a
little
matter
which
i
must
ask
you
to
explain
reaching
down
she
picked
up
a
small
stone
and
hurled
it
into
the
lily
pond
as
the
ripples
died
away
they
both
observed
a
convulsive
movement
of
the
water
a
churning
which
had
no
relation
to
the
missile
thrown
i
think
said
penny
evenly
that
you
understand
my
meaning
chapter
and
miss
kippenberg
watched
the
concentric
circles
race
each
other
to
the
far
edge
of
the
lily
pool
then
you
know
the
reason
why
this
part
of
the
estate
is
kept
closed
off
she
murmured
very
low
i
learned
about
the
alligator
yesterday
said
penny
why
is
such
an
ugly
brute
kept
here
it
was
none
of
my
doing
i
assure
you
i
hate
the
horrid
thing
surely
you
do
mean
to
suggest
i
am
not
suggesting
anything
yet
said
penny
quietly
but
you
must
realize
that
it
is
rather
unusual
to
keep
an
alligator
on
one
estate
my
father
brought
it
here
from
florida
miss
kippenberg
revealed
reluctantly
for
some
reason
the
creature
seemed
to
fascinate
him
he
insisted
upon
keeping
it
in
the
pond
your
father
is
not
living
here
now
i
am
told
that
is
true
miss
kippenberg
quickly
switched
the
subject
back
to
the
alligator
mother
and
i
would
like
to
get
rid
of
the
beast
but
never
been
able
to
do
it
any
zoo
should
be
willing
to
take
it
off
your
hands
mother
often
spoke
of
getting
in
touch
with
one
but
for
some
reason
she
never
did
i
suppose
she
hesitated
to
give
the
alligator
away
upon
father
account
penny
remained
silent
wondering
how
deeply
she
dared
probe
into
the
private
life
of
the
kippenberg
family
after
all
there
were
certain
inquiries
which
a
person
of
sensibility
could
not
make
she
could
very
well
ask
have
your
parents
separated
why
did
your
father
leave
home
is
it
true
he
is
wanted
by
the
authorities
for
evading
income
tax
although
these
questions
were
upon
the
tip
of
her
tongue
she
did
say
carelessly
your
father
is
away
is
he
yes
miss
kippenberg
answered
briefly
after
a
moment
she
went
on
father
was
rather
peculiar
in
many
ways
he
had
a
decided
flare
for
the
unusual
take
this
estate
for
instance
he
had
it
built
at
great
expense
to
resemble
a
castle
he
once
saw
in
germany
i
never
visited
such
an
elegant
place
it
is
entirely
too
flamboyant
for
my
taste
but
father
loved
every
tower
and
turret
if
only
things
had
turned
out
different
her
voice
trailed
away
and
she
stared
at
the
ground
lost
in
deep
thought
arousing
herself
she
went
on
once
more
if
you
had
known
father
you
would
understand
it
was
not
strange
for
him
to
have
an
alligator
on
the
estate
at
one
time
he
kept
imported
peacocks
the
place
was
fairly
overrun
with
them
penny
offered
no
comment
she
moved
closer
to
the
edge
of
the
lily
pool
gazing
down
into
the
now
tranquil
waters
i
know
what
you
are
trying
to
imply
miss
kippenberg
said
jerkily
it
could
be
possible
i
refuse
even
to
consider
such
a
ridiculous
theory
it
does
seem
rather
penny
admitted
of
course
tragedies
do
occur
and
those
please
not
another
word
or
you
drive
me
into
hysterics
sylvia
cried
you
are
trying
to
play
upon
my
feelings
so
that
i
will
tell
you
things
you
are
only
trying
to
get
a
story
i
not
talk
with
you
any
longer
she
turned
and
ran
up
the
path
toward
the
house
overplayed
my
hand
that
time
thought
penny
ruefully
as
dad
says
i
really
have
too
much
imagination
to
make
a
good
reporter
also
too
lively
a
tongue
miss
kippenberg
had
vanished
into
the
house
by
the
time
the
girl
retraced
her
way
to
the
garden
the
black
limousine
no
longer
stood
at
the
front
door
so
she
knew
she
was
expected
to
get
back
to
andover
by
her
own
efforts
if
jerry
is
still
waiting
at
the
drawbridge
i
ride
home
with
him
she
told
herself
otherwise
i
out
of
luck
completely
the
path
which
penny
followed
brought
her
toward
the
rear
of
the
house
as
she
drew
near
the
kitchen
door
suddenly
opened
and
a
stout
woman
in
a
blue
uniform
came
outside
in
her
arms
she
carried
two
large
paper
sacks
which
appeared
to
be
filled
with
garbage
for
the
bottoms
were
moist
just
as
the
woman
reached
penny
one
of
the
bags
gave
away
allowing
a
collection
of
corn
husks
watermelon
rinds
and
egg
shells
to
fall
on
the
sidewalk
now
i
done
it
she
exclaimed
crossly
splattered
my
stockings
too
oh
that
too
bad
said
penny
pausing
this
is
the
only
place
i
ever
worked
where
the
cook
was
expected
to
carry
out
the
garbage
the
woman
complained
it
makes
me
good
and
mad
every
time
i
do
it
i
should
think
a
house
of
this
size
would
have
an
incinerator
so
that
the
garbage
could
be
burned
penny
remarked
say
this
place
does
have
any
conveniences
for
the
servants
the
cook
went
on
you
expected
to
work
work
work
from
morning
to
night
she
broke
off
quickly
regarding
penny
with
a
suspicious
gaze
not
one
of
miss
sylvia
guests
she
demanded
oh
no
i
only
came
here
on
an
errand
i
would
repeat
anything
to
the
family
that
all
right
then
the
woman
said
in
relief
i
liked
my
job
here
well
enough
until
lately
all
month
it
been
one
dinner
party
after
another
then
we
spent
days
getting
ready
for
the
wedding
feast
and
not
one
scrap
of
food
was
touched
but
i
suppose
kippenberg
pays
you
well
listen
she
did
give
me
one
extra
cent
for
all
the
work
i
did
kippenberg
always
has
been
real
close
and
she
a
heap
worse
since
her
husband
went
away
another
week
like
this
last
one
and
i
quit
well
i
ca
say
i
blame
you
penny
said
leading
the
woman
on
i
suppose
miss
sylvia
is
as
overbearing
as
her
mother
oh
miss
sylvia
is
all
right
as
sweet
a
girl
as
you
find
anywhere
i
felt
mighty
sorry
for
her
when
that
man
threw
her
over
penny
knew
by
this
time
that
she
must
be
talking
with
mrs
latch
for
the
footman
had
mentioned
the
cook
name
as
the
woman
walked
on
with
her
bundles
of
garbage
she
fell
into
step
with
her
it
was
strange
about
atherwald
disappearance
she
remarked
i
hear
he
came
to
the
house
and
then
went
away
just
before
the
wedding
i
can
tell
you
about
that
replied
mrs
latch
with
an
important
air
yesterday
morning
a
boy
came
to
the
back
door
with
a
letter
for
atherwald
it
my
opinion
he
sent
it
to
himself
did
the
boy
tell
you
where
he
had
obtained
the
letter
he
said
it
was
given
to
him
by
one
of
atherwald
friends
a
man
in
a
boat
oh
i
see
said
penny
making
a
mental
note
of
the
information
realizing
that
the
cook
had
told
everything
she
knew
about
the
matter
she
quickly
switched
the
subject
by
the
way
who
is
the
head
gardener
here
do
you
mean
peter
henderson
a
fairly
old
man
described
penny
gray
hair
stooped
shoulders
and
i
might
add
an
unpleasant
manner
i
guess
that
peter
he
not
much
of
a
gardener
in
my
opinion
and
he
feels
too
high
and
mighty
to
associate
with
the
other
servants
he
does
even
stay
here
nights
is
he
a
new
man
kippenberg
hired
him
only
three
days
before
the
wedding
i
think
he
done
a
lick
of
honest
work
since
he
came
here
and
kippenberg
does
mind
she
been
too
busy
and
bothered
to
pay
any
attention
to
him
the
cook
declared
but
she
always
has
time
to
boss
me
i
tell
you
if
dishes
are
prepared
perfectly
she
raves
no
wonder
kippenberg
was
forced
to
leave
home
penny
interposed
slyly
you
ca
blame
him
for
running
away
from
a
violent
temper
oh
the
kippenbergs
never
had
any
trouble
mrs
latch
corrected
kippenberg
would
just
laugh
and
not
say
a
word
when
she
jumped
on
him
they
were
never
heard
to
quarrel
then
it
seems
odd
that
he
went
away
yes
it
does
agreed
the
cook
frowning
i
never
did
understand
it
and
then
the
way
kippenberg
changed
all
the
servants
you
mean
after
kippenberg
went
away
she
fired
everyone
except
me
i
guess
she
knew
she
could
get
another
cook
half
as
good
if
she
let
me
go
right
away
i
struck
for
more
money
and
she
gave
it
to
me
without
a
whimper
but
since
then
she
works
me
like
a
dog
mrs
latch
clattered
the
lid
of
the
garbage
can
into
place
and
turned
toward
the
house
but
as
penny
once
more
fell
into
step
with
her
she
paused
and
regarded
the
girl
with
sudden
suspicion
say
why
am
i
telling
you
all
this
anyway
who
are
you
you
not
one
of
those
sneaking
reporters
do
i
look
like
a
reporter
countered
penny
well
no
you
do
admitted
mrs
latch
but
you
as
inquisitive
as
one
you
must
be
the
girl
who
brought
miss
sylvia
new
dress
from
the
larue
shoppe
penny
hesitated
too
long
over
her
reply
and
the
woman
gazed
at
her
sharply
you
a
reporter
she
exclaimed
with
conviction
and
you
been
deliberately
pumping
me
of
all
the
tricks
i
tell
miss
kippenberg
wait
i
can
explain
mrs
latch
paid
no
heed
with
an
angry
toss
of
her
head
she
hastened
into
the
house
overstepped
myself
again
penny
thought
in
dismay
i
be
getting
away
from
here
while
the
getting
is
good
turning
she
ran
down
the
walk
toward
the
river
only
to
stop
short
as
she
reached
the
boat
dock
the
drawbridge
was
in
open
position
and
the
old
watchman
did
not
appear
to
be
at
his
usual
post
she
had
no
way
of
reaching
the
mainland
chapter
penny
looked
anxiously
about
for
a
means
of
crossing
the
river
there
were
no
small
boats
available
and
the
only
person
who
stood
on
the
opposite
shore
was
jerry
livingston
the
other
reporters
and
photographers
evidently
tiring
of
their
long
vigil
had
gone
away
she
cupped
her
hands
and
shouted
to
jerry
how
am
i
going
to
get
over
there
can
you
lower
the
bridge
the
mechanism
is
locked
called
back
the
reporter
and
the
watchman
wo
be
back
for
an
hour
penny
walked
a
short
distance
up
the
shore
searching
for
a
boat
the
only
available
craft
was
the
large
launch
which
she
could
not
hope
to
operate
she
might
return
to
the
house
and
appeal
to
miss
kippenberg
but
such
a
course
was
not
to
her
liking
as
she
considered
whether
or
not
to
ruin
her
clothing
by
swimming
across
jerry
called
her
attention
to
a
small
boat
some
distance
up
the
river
the
boy
who
was
fishing
from
it
obligingly
rowed
ashore
after
penny
had
signaled
him
i
give
you
fifty
cents
to
ferry
me
across
she
offered
i
be
glad
to
do
it
he
agreed
penny
stepped
into
the
boat
and
then
asked
are
you
the
same
lad
i
saw
here
yesterday
the
boy
nodded
as
he
reached
for
the
oars
i
remember
you
he
answered
you
seem
to
fish
here
nearly
every
day
just
about
i
caught
some
nice
ones
today
proudly
he
held
up
two
large
fish
for
her
to
see
beauties
praised
penny
i
take
it
the
motor
boats
have
been
bothering
you
as
much
as
they
were
it
been
pretty
quiet
on
the
river
today
the
boy
agreed
want
to
see
something
else
i
fished
up
why
yes
what
did
you
hook
a
mud
turtle
the
boy
opened
a
large
wooden
box
which
contained
an
assortment
of
rope
fishing
tackle
and
miscellaneous
articles
he
lifted
out
a
man
high
silk
hat
bedraggled
and
shapeless
you
fished
that
out
of
the
water
penny
demanded
leaning
forward
to
take
the
article
from
him
where
did
you
find
it
up
there
a
ways
the
boy
motioned
vaguely
toward
a
point
on
the
kippenberg
estate
penny
turned
the
hat
over
in
her
hand
examining
it
closely
she
found
no
identifying
marks
yet
she
believed
that
it
had
belonged
to
grant
atherwald
for
he
had
worn
similar
headdress
the
point
indicated
by
the
boy
was
not
far
distant
from
the
kippenberg
lily
pool
how
would
you
like
to
sell
this
hat
she
asked
why
it
not
worth
anything
i
like
to
have
it
said
penny
i
give
you
another
fifty
cents
it
a
deal
penny
offered
the
boy
a
dollar
bill
and
a
moment
later
he
beached
the
boat
jerry
was
waiting
to
help
her
ashore
his
alert
gaze
fastened
upon
the
hat
which
she
hugged
close
but
he
withheld
comment
to
the
boy
he
said
son
how
would
you
like
to
earn
five
dollars
the
boy
eyes
brightened
say
this
is
my
lucky
day
he
exclaimed
what
doin
it
easy
jerry
told
him
all
you
need
to
do
is
to
be
here
for
a
couple
of
days
with
your
boat
you
not
to
allow
anyone
to
use
it
except
me
and
me
added
penny
i
need
taxi
service
myself
if
i
come
back
here
that
all
right
agreed
the
boy
here
a
dollar
on
deposit
jerry
said
now
remember
be
here
tomorrow
from
eight
on
and
do
hire
out
to
any
other
person
i
wo
the
boy
promised
jerry
took
penny
elbow
and
escorted
her
to
the
press
car
so
you
found
atherwald
hat
he
asked
without
preliminaries
it
resembles
the
one
he
wore
the
boy
fished
it
out
of
the
river
then
that
looks
as
if
the
fellow
really
was
the
victim
of
a
plot
i
thought
so
all
along
penny
declared
soberly
what
else
did
you
learn
you
seemed
to
be
very
chummy
with
miss
kippenberg
i
not
be
from
now
on
penny
returned
ruefully
as
jerry
backed
the
car
around
in
the
dusty
road
she
told
of
her
meeting
with
sylvia
kippenberg
and
the
ensuing
conversation
so
miss
kippenberg
does
like
questions
jerry
asked
and
she
refuses
to
notify
the
police
well
after
we
publish
our
story
in
the
it
wo
be
necessary
the
police
will
come
to
do
their
own
investigating
i
ca
really
believe
she
is
trying
to
deceive
the
authorities
penny
said
thoughtfully
she
seems
to
have
a
sincere
regard
for
grant
atherwald
it
may
be
pretense
she
was
pretending
the
day
of
the
wedding
atherwald
disappearance
was
a
great
shock
to
her
well
even
so
she
may
know
a
lot
more
than
she
putting
out
i
think
that
myself
she
closed
up
like
a
clam
when
i
talked
about
her
father
the
car
came
to
the
main
road
and
a
short
time
later
entered
the
town
of
corbin
as
they
stopped
for
a
red
light
penny
touched
jerry
arm
look
over
there
she
directed
see
those
two
men
standing
in
front
of
the
drugstore
what
about
them
they
g
men
who
attended
the
kippenberg
wedding
salt
pointed
them
out
to
me
you
do
say
maybe
we
can
learn
a
fact
or
two
from
them
jerry
parked
the
car
at
the
curb
and
sprang
out
penny
saw
him
walk
over
to
the
men
introduce
himself
and
show
his
press
credentials
she
was
too
far
away
to
hear
the
conversation
in
a
few
minutes
jerry
returned
to
the
car
looking
none
too
elated
you
did
learn
anything
did
you
penny
inquired
as
they
drove
on
again
not
very
much
government
men
never
will
talk
but
they
did
admit
they
were
here
trying
to
locate
james
kippenberg
then
they
think
he
is
in
the
locality
they
had
an
idea
he
would
show
up
at
his
daughter
wedding
but
it
did
turn
out
that
way
did
you
say
anything
to
them
about
grant
atherwald
disappearance
yes
but
they
would
discuss
it
they
said
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
penny
lapsed
into
reflective
silence
as
the
car
went
on
toward
andover
mentally
she
sorted
over
the
evidence
which
she
had
gathered
that
day
trying
to
fit
it
into
a
definite
pattern
jerry
she
said
at
last
yes
you
probably
laugh
at
this
but
i
have
a
theory
about
grant
atherwald
disappearance
go
ahead
spill
it
yesterday
when
salt
and
i
were
waiting
at
the
drawbridge
we
saw
a
motorboat
cruise
down
the
river
it
was
driven
by
a
burly
looking
fellow
who
paid
no
heed
when
we
tried
to
hail
him
you
not
suggesting
that
the
man
may
have
had
something
to
do
with
atherwald
disappearance
jerry
questioned
mildly
amused
i
knew
you
would
laugh
your
theory
sounds
pretty
to
me
i
admit
it
happens
there
are
any
number
of
burly
tough
looking
boatmen
on
the
kobalt
you
ca
arrest
a
man
for
a
crime
just
because
of
his
appearance
all
the
same
there
is
supporting
evidence
mrs
latch
told
me
that
atherwald
note
had
been
handed
to
her
by
a
boy
who
in
turn
received
it
from
someone
in
a
boat
boats
are
rather
common
too
your
theory
is
interesting
but
that
all
i
can
say
for
it
all
right
said
penny
i
was
about
to
tell
you
another
idea
of
mine
now
i
wo
do
it
no
amount
of
coaxing
could
induce
her
to
reveal
her
thought
and
the
remainder
of
the
drive
to
andover
was
made
in
silence
it
was
well
after
when
the
car
finally
drew
up
in
front
of
the
city
club
penny
was
not
surprised
to
find
the
doors
locked
and
no
sign
of
louise
or
miss
frome
i
thought
they
would
go
home
without
me
she
said
to
jerry
i
only
wanted
to
make
certain
for
many
miles
the
road
led
through
pleasant
countryside
and
then
swung
back
toward
the
kobalt
river
the
sun
had
dropped
below
the
horizon
by
the
time
the
automobile
sped
through
the
town
of
claxton
thirty
miles
still
to
go
jerry
sighed
i
getting
hungry
two
souls
with
but
a
single
thought
remarked
penny
directly
ahead
they
noticed
an
electric
sign
which
drew
attention
to
a
roadside
gasoline
station
with
an
adjoining
restaurant
jerry
eased
on
the
brake
how
about
it
penny
shall
we
invest
a
few
nickels
i
could
do
with
a
sandwich
penny
agreed
several
in
fact
not
until
jerry
had
parked
the
car
did
they
notice
the
dilapidated
condition
of
the
building
it
stood
perhaps
fifty
yards
back
from
the
main
road
its
rear
porch
fronting
on
the
kobalt
strange
how
one
is
always
running
into
the
river
penny
remarked
absently
it
seems
to
twist
itself
over
half
the
state
jerry
had
not
heard
her
words
he
was
gazing
at
the
restaurant
with
disapproval
this
place
does
look
so
good
penny
if
you
say
the
word
we
drive
on
oh
i
brave
anything
for
a
beef
barbecue
she
laughed
through
the
screen
door
they
caught
a
discouraging
glimpse
of
the
interior
dingy
walls
cigarette
smoke
a
group
of
rough
looking
men
seated
on
stools
at
the
counter
upon
the
threshold
penny
hesitated
losing
courage
let
not
go
in
jerry
grunted
in
an
undertone
they
probably
serve
cockroaches
in
the
sandwiches
penny
half
turned
away
from
the
door
only
to
stop
short
her
attention
focused
upon
two
men
who
were
sitting
at
the
far
end
of
the
cafe
drinking
coffee
from
heavy
mugs
in
the
indistinct
light
she
could
not
be
absolutely
sure
yet
she
was
instantly
convinced
that
the
fellow
in
shirt
sleeves
was
the
same
boatman
who
had
been
seen
near
the
kippenberg
estate
to
jerry
surprise
penny
resisted
the
tug
of
his
arm
as
he
sought
to
lead
her
toward
the
car
this
place
is
half
bad
she
said
let
try
it
and
see
what
happens
boldly
she
reached
for
the
knob
of
the
screen
door
and
entered
the
cafe
chapter
men
and
a
penny
ignored
several
empty
tables
at
the
front
of
the
dreary
restaurant
and
selected
one
not
far
from
where
the
two
men
sat
as
they
glanced
at
her
with
insolent
appraising
eyes
her
pulse
quickened
she
was
almost
certain
that
the
man
was
the
same
fellow
she
had
noticed
near
the
kippenberg
estate
a
waiter
in
a
soiled
white
apron
shuffled
up
to
take
their
order
hot
roast
beef
sandwich
and
coffee
said
jerry
with
plenty
of
cream
make
mine
the
same
added
penny
without
looking
at
the
menu
all
her
attention
centered
upon
the
two
men
who
were
now
talking
together
in
low
tones
after
the
first
glance
they
had
taken
no
interest
in
her
and
were
unaware
of
her
scrutiny
the
man
bent
nearer
his
companion
and
with
the
point
of
his
knife
drew
a
pattern
on
the
tablecloth
what
do
you
think
of
this
route
joe
he
asked
too
risky
the
other
muttered
once
we
start
we
got
to
make
a
quick
shoot
to
the
sea
any
way
we
take
we
might
run
into
trouble
i
wish
we
had
never
agreed
to
do
the
job
you
and
me
both
dietz
ai
to
be
trusted
the
man
said
and
his
shaggy
eyebrows
drew
together
in
a
scowl
he
thinking
first
and
last
of
his
own
skin
we
got
to
watch
him
and
the
girl
too
she
a
dumb
one
and
plenty
apt
to
talk
if
the
going
gets
rough
penny
lost
the
remainder
of
the
conversation
as
jerry
spoke
to
her
we
could
have
picked
a
worse
place
he
complained
look
at
all
the
breakfast
egg
on
the
tablecloth
i
in
favor
of
walking
out
even
now
i
not
replied
penny
say
what
got
into
you
anyway
jerry
demanded
you
acting
mighty
funny
notice
those
two
men
at
the
last
table
she
indicated
what
about
them
see
that
fellow
with
the
tattooed
anchor
on
his
arm
well
satisfied
he
is
the
same
boatman
who
cruised
near
the
kippenberg
estate
yesterday
afternoon
it
might
be
jerry
agreed
unimpressed
the
kobalt
is
only
a
throw
away
and
this
place
seems
to
be
frequented
by
rivermen
you
did
hear
what
they
were
saying
whispered
penny
listen
jerry
immediately
fell
silent
centering
his
attention
upon
the
two
men
but
by
this
time
they
had
lowered
their
voices
so
that
only
an
occasional
word
could
be
distinguished
what
were
they
saying
anyway
jerry
asked
curiously
before
penny
could
answer
the
proprietor
came
from
the
kitchen
bearing
two
plates
of
food
which
he
set
down
before
them
the
sandwiches
were
covered
with
a
dark
brown
watery
gravy
potatoes
bore
a
heavy
coating
of
grease
and
the
coffee
looked
weak
anything
more
the
man
inquired
indifferently
that
all
jerry
replied
with
emphasis
in
fact
it
too
much
at
the
adjoining
table
the
two
men
abruptly
hauled
to
their
feet
paying
their
bill
they
quitted
the
restaurant
let
leave
too
suggested
penny
i
should
like
to
see
where
they
go
jerry
pushed
his
plate
aside
suits
me
he
agreed
even
my
stomach
ca
wrestle
with
such
food
as
this
he
paid
at
the
cash
register
and
they
went
out
into
the
night
penny
looked
about
for
the
two
men
and
saw
them
walking
toward
the
river
hold
on
said
jerry
as
she
started
to
follow
tell
me
what
all
the
excitement
is
about
tersely
penny
repeated
the
conversation
she
had
overheard
they
tough
looking
hombres
all
right
jerry
admitted
likely
as
not
mixed
up
in
some
dirty
business
but
to
say
they
involved
in
the
kippenberg
affair
oh
jerry
penny
broke
in
impatiently
we
never
learn
anything
if
we
take
that
attitude
we
must
run
down
every
possible
clue
please
let
see
if
they
go
down
to
the
river
we
ought
to
be
getting
our
story
back
to
the
office
jerry
reminded
her
if
we
miss
the
last
edition
there
will
be
fireworks
it
will
only
take
a
minute
penny
insisted
stubbornly
if
you
come
with
me
then
i
going
alone
she
started
away
and
the
reporter
had
no
choice
but
to
follow
a
narrow
path
led
down
a
steep
slope
toward
the
river
long
before
they
came
within
sight
of
it
they
could
hear
the
croak
of
bullfrogs
and
feel
the
damp
night
mists
enveloping
them
like
a
cloak
drawing
closer
to
the
two
men
penny
and
jerry
slackened
pace
and
moved
with
greater
care
but
if
they
hoped
to
learn
anything
from
the
conversation
of
the
pair
ahead
they
were
disappointed
the
talk
concerned
only
the
weather
reaching
the
banks
of
the
river
the
two
men
boarded
a
sturdy
cabin
cruiser
which
had
been
moored
to
a
sagging
dock
it
the
very
same
boat
penny
whispered
jubilantly
i
knew
i
mistaken
even
so
what
does
that
prove
demanded
jerry
it
no
crime
to
run
a
motorboat
near
the
kippenberg
estate
the
river
is
free
but
you
must
admit
there
other
evidence
oh
why
ca
we
follow
them
we
might
learn
something
really
important
we
not
going
off
on
any
wild
chase
tonight
stated
jerry
sternly
come
on
it
home
for
us
before
your
father
sends
a
police
squad
to
search
for
his
missing
daughter
you
losing
a
golden
opportunity
jerry
livingston
listen
by
the
time
we
located
a
boat
those
men
would
be
ten
miles
from
here
they
leaving
now
use
your
head
oh
all
right
penny
gave
in
we
go
home
but
i
bet
a
cent
you
be
sorry
later
on
she
waited
until
the
cruiser
was
lost
to
view
in
the
darkness
and
then
allowed
the
reporter
to
guide
her
back
up
the
steep
path
at
least
let
try
to
find
out
who
the
men
are
penny
urged
as
they
came
near
the
cafe
the
restaurant
owner
might
know
more
to
please
her
than
for
any
other
reason
jerry
said
that
he
would
inquire
he
the
cafe
returning
in
a
few
minutes
to
report
that
the
proprietor
had
never
seen
either
of
the
men
before
and
now
let
be
traveling
he
urged
we
killed
enough
time
here
during
the
remainder
of
the
ride
back
to
riverview
penny
had
little
to
say
but
long
after
she
knew
jerry
had
forgotten
the
two
boatmen
she
kept
turning
their
conversation
over
in
her
mind
she
only
wished
she
might
prove
that
her
theories
were
not
ridiculous
presently
the
automobile
drew
up
in
front
of
the
parker
residence
wo
you
come
in
jerry
penny
invited
dad
may
wish
to
talk
with
you
about
the
case
i
might
stop
a
minute
i
have
a
question
or
two
to
ask
him
the
door
of
the
house
swung
open
as
penny
and
the
reporter
crossed
the
front
porch
anthony
parker
stood
framed
in
the
bright
electric
light
a
tall
imposing
figure
that
you
penny
yes
dad
i
glad
you
home
safe
he
said
not
trying
to
hide
his
relief
weems
and
i
have
both
been
worried
it
going
on
nine
so
late
did
louise
telephone
you
yes
she
said
you
had
gone
on
to
the
kippenberg
estate
knowing
you
i
worried
all
the
more
what
mischief
did
you
get
into
this
time
penny
none
jerry
took
care
of
that
parker
held
the
door
open
for
his
daughter
and
jerry
to
pass
through
have
you
had
your
dinners
he
asked
we
stopped
at
a
roadside
cafe
dad
but
the
food
was
horrible
we
even
try
to
eat
it
weems
can
find
something
for
you
i
sure
she
upstairs
do
call
her
just
yet
said
penny
first
we
want
to
tell
you
what
we
learned
parker
listened
attentively
as
penny
gave
a
detailed
account
of
her
visit
to
the
estate
the
finding
of
the
silk
hat
and
finally
of
her
encounter
with
the
two
boatmen
at
the
river
cafe
i
might
have
learned
a
lot
more
if
only
jerry
had
played
grandmother
she
said
crossly
he
refused
to
follow
the
boat
down
the
river
said
it
would
only
be
a
wild
chase
jerry
i
glad
you
had
will
power
enough
to
overrule
her
declared
parker
the
possibility
of
those
men
being
connected
with
the
atherwald
case
seems
very
vague
to
me
dad
you
should
have
heard
what
they
were
saying
the
one
man
drew
a
design
on
the
tablecloth
and
asked
his
companion
what
he
thought
of
the
route
they
talked
about
a
quick
to
the
sea
the
men
may
have
been
fugitives
parker
commented
but
even
that
is
very
likely
they
spoke
of
being
uneasy
about
a
certain
job
they
had
agreed
to
do
penny
went
on
earnestly
they
mentioned
a
girl
and
said
that
a
fellow
named
dietz
would
bear
watching
parker
leaned
forward
in
his
chair
dietz
he
questioned
are
you
certain
that
was
the
name
yes
i
heard
it
clearly
i
do
see
how
there
could
be
any
connection
parker
mused
and
yet
where
did
you
hear
the
name
before
dad
penny
asked
all
eagerness
well
dewitt
has
been
digging
up
all
the
facts
he
can
about
james
kippenberg
as
it
happens
the
man
once
had
a
business
associate
named
aaron
dietz
who
was
dismissed
because
of
alleged
dishonesty
then
there
must
be
a
relationship
penny
cried
she
whirled
triumphantly
to
face
the
crestfallen
reporter
you
see
jerry
livingston
my
theory
was
so
crazy
after
all
now
are
you
sorry
chapter
stone
louise
sidell
was
washing
the
breakfast
dishes
when
penny
walked
boldly
in
at
the
back
door
do
you
ever
answer
doorbells
lou
she
demanded
i
stood
around
front
for
half
an
hour
ringing
and
ringing
why
hello
penny
i
did
hear
you
at
all
apologized
louise
the
radio
is
on
too
loud
i
see
you
reached
home
last
night
penny
picked
up
a
towel
and
began
to
dry
dishes
oh
yes
and
did
i
have
a
day
what
happened
after
you
left
andover
it
a
long
story
so
i
begin
at
the
end
last
night
coming
home
with
jerry
we
stopped
at
a
cafe
along
the
river
guess
whom
we
saw
knowing
your
luck
i
say
charlie
chaplin
or
maybe
the
queen
of
england
this
particular
cafe
was
quite
their
speed
lou
jerry
and
i
saw
that
same
boatman
i
told
you
about
the
fellow
you
saw
cruising
about
the
kippenberg
estate
what
so
remarkable
about
that
it
just
happens
i
dug
up
other
evidence
to
show
he
may
know
something
about
grant
atherwald
disappearance
penny
revealed
proudly
jerry
and
i
overheard
a
conversation
it
seems
this
man
and
a
companion
of
his
are
mixed
up
with
another
fellow
named
aaron
dietz
which
does
make
sense
to
me
complained
louise
scrubbing
hard
at
a
sticky
plate
aaron
dietz
was
a
former
associate
of
james
kippenberg
dad
said
he
probably
knew
more
about
the
kippenberg
financial
affairs
than
any
other
person
oh
i
tell
you
jerry
feels
pretty
sick
because
we
did
follow
the
men
last
night
dad
assigned
him
to
try
to
pick
up
the
trail
today
he
chartered
a
motor
boat
and
will
patrol
the
river
if
you
do
mind
said
louise
patiently
i
like
to
hear
the
first
part
of
the
story
now
then
i
might
know
what
this
is
all
about
talking
as
fast
as
she
could
penny
related
everything
which
had
happened
since
she
had
taken
leave
of
her
chum
at
andover
which
brings
me
to
the
point
of
my
visit
she
ended
her
tale
how
about
going
out
there
with
me
this
morning
to
the
kippenberg
estate
louise
asked
eagerly
yes
we
may
not
be
able
to
get
across
the
river
but
i
mean
to
try
you
know
i
wild
to
visit
the
place
penny
how
soon
can
you
start
just
as
soon
as
these
stupid
dishes
are
done
and
i
ought
to
change
my
dress
wear
something
dark
which
wo
attract
attention
in
the
bushes
advised
penny
now
get
to
working
on
yourself
while
i
finish
the
dishes
louise
dropped
the
dishcloth
and
hurried
upstairs
when
she
returned
ten
minutes
later
her
chum
was
swishing
the
last
of
the
soapsuds
down
the
sink
drain
another
five
minutes
and
they
were
in
penny
battered
car
speeding
toward
corbin
the
sun
rode
high
in
the
sky
by
the
time
they
came
within
view
of
the
drawbridge
noticing
that
a
press
car
from
a
rival
newspaper
was
parked
at
the
end
of
the
road
penny
drew
up
some
distance
away
she
could
see
two
reporters
talking
with
the
old
watchman
evidently
they
having
no
luck
in
getting
over
to
the
estate
she
remarked
then
what
about
us
oh
we
have
our
own
private
taxi
service
penny
chuckled
at
least
i
hope
so
taking
a
circuitous
route
so
they
would
not
be
noticed
by
the
bridgeman
the
girls
went
down
to
the
river
edge
far
up
the
stream
penny
saw
the
familiar
rowboat
drifting
with
the
current
at
her
signal
the
small
boy
seized
his
oars
and
rowed
toward
shore
i
was
here
at
eight
just
as
you
said
he
declared
that
fellow
up
there
by
the
bridge
offered
me
a
dollar
to
take
him
across
the
river
i
turned
him
down
good
approved
penny
do
you
want
to
go
across
the
river
now
the
boy
asked
yes
please
penny
stepped
into
the
boat
and
made
room
for
louise
keep
close
to
the
bank
until
we
are
around
the
bend
then
i
show
you
where
to
land
i
guess
you
afraid
someone
will
see
you
the
boy
commented
not
exactly
afraid
corrected
penny
but
this
way
will
be
best
the
boat
moved
quietly
along
the
high
bank
well
out
of
sight
of
those
who
stood
by
the
drawbridge
the
cops
were
here
this
morning
volunteered
the
boy
as
he
pulled
at
the
oars
you
saw
them
visit
the
estate
penny
questioned
sure
there
were
four
of
they
drove
up
in
a
police
car
and
they
made
old
thorndyke
let
the
bridge
down
so
they
could
go
across
are
the
policemen
at
the
estate
now
no
they
left
again
in
about
an
hour
what
do
you
suppose
they
wanted
over
there
well
now
i
could
guess
replied
penny
like
as
not
they
only
wished
to
ask
a
few
questions
are
the
kippenbergs
at
home
i
saw
kippenberg
drive
away
right
after
the
police
left
and
her
daughter
i
guess
she
must
be
still
there
anyway
she
was
in
the
car
the
boat
rounded
the
bend
and
penny
pointed
out
a
place
on
the
opposite
shore
where
she
wished
to
land
shall
i
wait
for
you
the
boy
asked
as
the
girls
stepped
from
the
craft
yes
but
not
here
directed
penny
you
might
row
back
to
the
opposite
shore
and
keep
watch
from
there
we
ought
to
be
ready
to
leave
within
at
least
an
hour
the
roof
top
of
the
kippenberg
house
could
be
seen
towering
above
the
tall
trees
but
as
the
two
girls
plunged
into
the
bushes
which
grew
thickly
along
the
shore
they
lost
sight
of
it
entirely
i
hope
said
louise
uneasily
that
you
know
where
you
are
going
it
would
be
easy
to
lose
one
self
in
this
jungle
oh
i
have
my
directions
straight
we
should
come
out
near
the
lily
pool
at
any
minute
what
do
you
hope
to
gain
by
coming
here
penny
louise
inquired
abruptly
i
thought
i
would
try
to
talk
with
miss
kippenberg
again
there
an
important
question
i
forgot
to
ask
her
yesterday
then
i
wanted
to
show
you
the
estate
especially
the
lily
pond
is
there
anything
unusual
about
it
i
let
you
be
the
judge
penny
answered
we
almost
there
now
they
came
in
a
moment
to
a
path
which
made
walking
much
easier
penny
went
in
advance
of
her
chum
suddenly
she
halted
see
what
is
ahead
lou
i
never
saw
that
thing
before
she
stepped
to
one
side
so
that
louise
might
see
the
tall
stone
tower
which
loomed
up
against
a
background
of
scarlet
maples
how
curious
murmured
louise
this
is
the
only
queer
thing
i
found
on
the
estate
what
purpose
could
the
tower
have
speculated
louise
decoration
perhaps
replied
penny
moving
forward
again
or
it
might
have
been
built
for
a
prison
listen
you
have
too
many
different
theories
about
grant
atherwald
laughed
louise
why
do
you
get
one
and
stick
to
it
my
mind
is
always
open
to
new
possibilities
and
impressions
i
say
it
is
agreed
louise
i
suppose
you
think
kippenberg
is
keeping
young
atherwald
a
prisoner
in
yonder
tower
well
no
but
you
must
admit
it
would
make
a
lovely
one
so
romantic
are
you
trying
to
kid
me
louise
demanded
penny
smiled
broadly
as
she
stared
up
at
the
tower
which
rose
perhaps
twelve
feet
like
every
other
building
on
the
estate
it
had
been
built
to
resist
the
ages
high
above
her
head
a
circular
window
had
been
cut
in
the
wall
and
there
was
a
heavy
oaken
door
reaching
for
the
knob
penny
turned
it
then
she
pressed
her
shoulder
against
the
door
and
pushed
with
her
entire
strength
locked
she
announced
then
we
wo
learn
what
is
inside
after
all
yes
we
will
declared
penny
you
lift
me
up
and
i
peep
in
the
window
you
only
weigh
a
ton
complained
louise
she
obligingly
raised
penny
up
as
high
as
she
could
look
fast
she
panted
what
do
you
see
not
much
of
anything
i
ca
hold
you
forever
louise
said
and
released
her
hold
you
see
anything
at
all
just
a
lot
of
machinery
tools
you
mean
no
an
electric
motor
and
something
which
looked
like
it
might
be
a
pump
oh
i
get
it
now
get
what
demanded
louise
why
the
idea
of
this
tower
it
must
be
used
as
a
pump
house
i
wondered
how
the
lily
pool
was
ever
drained
and
this
must
be
the
answer
you
did
see
any
prisoners
chained
inside
louise
teased
not
one
well
let
be
getting
on
to
the
lily
pond
it
must
be
somewhere
close
louise
could
not
understand
why
her
chum
was
so
determined
that
she
should
see
the
pool
but
since
penny
seldom
did
anything
without
a
purpose
she
speculated
upon
what
might
be
in
store
she
knew
from
the
girl
manner
that
certain
facts
had
been
withheld
deliberately
to
make
this
visit
the
more
impressive
here
we
are
said
penny
as
they
came
to
the
clearing
what
do
you
think
of
it
louise
was
aware
of
a
deep
sense
of
disappointment
as
she
gazed
at
the
lily
pool
i
really
do
see
anything
so
remarkable
about
it
penny
this
was
the
place
where
i
found
the
wedding
ring
and
there
were
footprints
indicating
that
a
struggle
probably
took
place
i
read
all
that
in
the
paper
louise
said
from
the
hints
you
been
passing
out
i
thought
you
brought
me
here
to
show
me
something
mysterious
go
close
to
the
pool
what
for
penny
you
want
to
push
me
in
oh
you
too
suspicious
go
on
and
look
louise
went
to
the
edge
of
the
pool
and
peered
down
into
the
water
i
do
see
anything
you
will
in
just
a
minute
keep
looking
louise
was
more
than
half
convinced
that
penny
meant
to
play
some
prank
but
she
dropped
down
on
her
knees
so
her
eyes
would
be
closer
to
the
water
why
i
do
see
some
large
object
on
the
floor
of
the
tank
she
exclaimed
after
a
moment
what
is
it
penny
an
alligator
louise
gave
a
smothered
scream
and
drew
back
from
the
pool
edge
i
i
might
have
fallen
in
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
i
only
wanted
you
to
get
a
nice
thrill
penny
grinned
pretty
fellow
is
he
i
did
really
see
him
louise
admitted
overcoming
her
fear
she
again
leaned
over
the
edge
of
the
pool
but
with
great
caution
this
time
she
could
make
out
the
alligator
form
distinctly
horrible
she
shuddered
i
wish
you
had
brought
me
her
words
ended
in
a
little
wail
as
a
tiny
object
splashed
into
the
water
directly
beneath
her
my
cameo
pin
she
cried
oh
penny
it
slipped
from
my
dress
and
now
it
gone
chapter
cameo
in
dismay
the
two
girls
watched
the
trinket
settle
slowly
to
the
bottom
of
the
pool
oh
my
beautiful
pin
moaned
louise
aunt
lucinda
gave
it
to
me
for
my
birthday
i
would
have
lost
it
for
anything
in
the
world
i
guess
it
was
my
fault
penny
said
no
it
was
i
must
have
been
careless
about
fastening
the
clasp
when
i
leaned
over
it
slipped
off
well
it
gone
and
that
that
the
cameo
pin
had
fallen
into
the
deepest
part
of
the
pool
not
far
from
where
the
alligator
lay
the
girls
were
unable
to
see
it
plainly
because
of
the
lily
pads
and
plants
which
cluttered
the
water
if
that
old
alligator
would
just
behave
himself
we
could
wade
in
and
get
it
easy
penny
said
fancy
trying
it
i
afraid
he
would
take
special
delight
in
snapping
off
an
arm
or
a
leg
and
we
do
dare
ask
anyone
to
help
us
get
the
pin
or
we
be
ejected
from
the
grounds
as
trespassers
we
may
as
well
forget
about
it
penny
come
along
i
sick
of
this
place
no
wait
louise
we
might
be
able
to
fish
it
out
with
a
stick
i
do
think
we
have
a
chance
anyway
it
will
do
no
harm
to
try
penny
searched
the
woods
until
she
found
a
long
stick
with
a
curve
at
the
end
lying
flat
on
the
flagstones
at
the
edge
of
the
pool
she
prodded
for
the
pin
i
can
touch
it
all
right
she
cried
i
pull
it
over
to
the
side
be
careful
you
do
tumble
in
louise
warned
anxiously
holding
her
chum
by
the
waist
if
you
should
lose
your
balance
penny
hooked
the
cameo
pin
in
the
curve
of
the
stick
and
began
raising
it
inch
by
inch
up
the
side
of
the
pool
if
i
can
get
it
up
high
enough
reach
down
and
snatch
it
penny
advised
her
chum
oh
shoot
there
it
goes
the
pin
had
slipped
away
from
the
stick
and
settled
once
more
on
the
bottom
of
the
pool
you
ca
get
it
penny
louise
insisted
you
making
the
alligator
all
excited
by
prodding
around
i
do
care
about
i
try
once
more
if
i
can
locate
the
pin
it
seems
to
be
hiding
from
me
now
the
water
was
so
disturbed
that
penny
could
not
see
the
pin
or
the
bottom
of
the
pool
she
waited
several
minutes
for
the
dirt
to
settle
and
then
gazed
down
once
more
there
it
is
she
exclaimed
it
moved
over
quite
a
ways
to
the
right
louise
flattened
herself
beside
penny
oh
let
the
pin
go
she
said
no
i
think
i
can
get
it
say
there
seems
to
be
something
else
on
the
bottom
of
the
pool
where
penny
pointed
and
then
as
her
chum
still
could
not
distinguish
anything
parted
the
lily
pads
with
her
stick
yes
i
do
see
something
now
louise
declared
what
can
it
be
does
it
look
like
a
metal
ring
penny
asked
she
had
lost
all
interest
in
the
cameo
pin
yes
it
does
someone
probably
threw
it
into
the
pool
but
it
looks
to
me
as
if
it
attached
to
the
bottom
of
the
tank
embedded
in
the
cement
penny
said
she
bent
closer
to
the
water
trying
to
see
be
careful
louise
warned
nervously
that
alligator
might
come
up
and
snap
off
your
nose
penny
paid
no
heed
it
is
attached
she
announced
in
an
excited
voice
louise
do
you
know
what
i
think
what
it
the
ring
of
a
trapdoor
a
trapdoor
louise
echoed
incredulously
you
can
see
for
yourself
that
it
an
iron
ring
it
does
look
a
little
like
one
from
here
louise
admitted
but
whoever
heard
of
a
trapdoor
in
a
lily
pool
no
one
but
you
would
even
think
of
such
a
thing
it
does
make
sense
does
anything
on
this
estate
make
sense
the
ring
might
have
something
to
do
with
draining
the
pool
louise
said
without
replying
to
her
chum
question
i
suppose
a
section
of
the
pool
could
be
lifted
up
and
removed
but
i
never
call
it
a
trapdoor
i
wish
we
could
tell
for
sure
what
it
is
penny
tried
to
prod
the
ring
with
her
stick
but
it
was
well
beyond
her
reach
maybe
the
alligator
has
a
room
down
under
the
pool
where
he
spends
his
winters
you
simply
filled
with
ideas
today
louise
declared
what
about
my
pin
shall
we
let
it
go
reminded
of
her
original
task
penny
set
to
work
once
more
trying
to
draw
the
cameo
to
the
edge
of
the
tank
she
was
so
deeply
engrossed
that
she
jumped
as
her
chum
touched
her
on
the
arm
listen
penny
i
think
someone
is
coming
from
the
path
at
the
right
they
could
hear
approaching
footsteps
and
the
low
murmur
of
voices
penny
struggled
to
her
feet
dropping
the
stick
we
must
be
caught
here
she
whispered
taking
louise
hand
she
drew
the
girl
into
the
dense
bushes
directly
behind
the
pool
scarcely
had
they
secreted
themselves
when
sylvia
kippenberg
and
the
head
gardener
came
into
view
they
seated
themselves
on
a
rustic
bench
not
far
from
where
the
two
girls
stood
i
had
to
talk
with
you
sylvia
said
to
the
old
man
the
police
came
this
morning
and
asked
so
many
questions
mother
put
them
off
but
be
back
again
they
did
learn
about
the
alligator
the
gardener
asked
gruffly
no
they
came
here
but
only
stayed
a
few
minutes
i
do
think
they
noticed
anything
wrong
then
that
all
right
their
investigation
is
only
beginning
sylvia
said
nervously
mother
and
i
both
believe
it
would
be
wise
to
get
rid
of
the
alligator
wise
but
not
easy
the
gardener
replied
you
see
what
you
can
do
about
it
yes
i
try
to
get
rid
of
him
then
i
guess
that
all
sylvia
said
but
she
made
no
move
to
leave
she
sat
staring
moodily
at
the
pool
anything
else
on
your
mind
asked
the
gardener
i
i
wanted
to
ask
you
something
but
i
scarcely
know
how
the
gardener
waited
watching
the
girl
face
intently
you
never
liked
grant
atherwald
she
began
nervously
say
what
are
you
driving
at
the
man
asked
quickly
you
not
trying
to
hint
that
i
had
anything
to
do
with
grant
atherwald
disappearance
the
two
faced
each
other
and
sylvia
gaze
was
the
first
to
fall
no
no
of
course
not
she
said
i
do
know
any
more
about
his
disappearance
than
you
do
the
man
told
her
angrily
i
did
even
see
him
on
the
day
of
the
wedding
but
he
came
here
the
wedding
ring
was
found
near
the
pool
surely
you
must
have
heard
some
sound
for
i
know
you
were
in
this
part
of
the
garden
well
i
did
the
man
said
sullenly
the
only
persons
i
saw
were
a
newspaper
photographer
and
a
girl
please
do
take
offense
miss
kippenberg
murmured
getting
up
from
the
bench
i
been
terribly
upset
these
past
few
days
she
walked
slowly
to
the
edge
of
the
pool
there
she
stopped
short
staring
down
at
an
object
which
lay
on
the
flagstones
at
her
feet
it
was
the
stick
which
penny
had
dropped
only
a
moment
before
what
have
you
found
the
gardener
cried
he
went
quickly
to
her
side
and
took
the
damp
stick
from
her
hand
someone
has
been
here
prying
around
he
said
in
a
harsh
voice
this
was
used
to
investigate
the
water
in
the
pool
and
whoever
it
was
must
be
close
by
even
now
otherwise
the
stick
would
have
dried
out
in
the
sun
you
go
back
to
the
house
the
man
commanded
i
look
around
in
their
hideout
amid
the
bushes
penny
and
louise
gazed
at
each
other
with
chagrin
no
word
was
spoken
for
even
a
whisper
might
have
been
heard
with
a
common
desire
for
escape
they
glided
with
tread
toward
the
river
chapter
the
girls
could
hear
no
movement
behind
them
as
they
darted
down
the
path
they
dared
to
hope
that
they
had
eluded
the
old
gardener
then
as
they
came
within
sight
of
the
river
louise
stumbled
over
a
vine
although
she
stifled
an
outcry
the
dull
thud
of
her
body
against
the
ground
seemed
actually
to
reverberate
through
the
forest
a
black
crow
on
the
lower
limb
of
an
oak
tree
cawed
in
protest
before
he
flew
away
penny
pulled
louise
to
her
feet
and
they
went
on
as
fast
as
they
could
but
they
knew
the
sound
had
betrayed
them
now
they
could
hear
the
man
in
pursuit
his
heavy
shoes
pounding
on
the
hard
dry
path
run
penny
commanded
they
reached
the
river
bank
and
looked
about
for
the
boat
which
would
take
them
across
as
they
had
feared
it
was
on
the
opposite
shore
penny
gestured
frantically
but
the
boy
did
not
understand
the
need
for
haste
he
picked
up
his
oars
and
rowed
toward
them
at
a
very
deliberate
pace
oh
he
never
get
here
in
time
louise
murmured
fearfully
shall
we
hide
that
all
we
can
do
they
realized
then
that
they
had
waited
too
long
before
they
could
dodge
into
the
deeper
thicket
the
gardener
reached
the
clearing
so
it
you
again
he
cried
wrathfully
glaring
at
penny
please
we
did
mean
any
harm
we
can
explain
this
stick
is
explanation
enough
for
me
the
man
shouted
waving
it
above
his
head
you
were
trying
to
find
out
about
the
lily
pool
we
were
only
trying
to
get
a
pin
which
i
dropped
into
the
water
louise
said
backing
a
step
away
i
do
believe
you
the
man
snapped
you
ca
fool
me
i
know
why
you
came
here
and
you
pay
for
your
folly
you
never
take
the
secret
away
with
you
with
a
swift
spring
which
belied
his
age
the
gardener
hurled
himself
toward
the
girls
he
seized
penny
arm
giving
it
a
cruel
twist
you
coming
along
with
me
he
announced
harshly
let
me
go
penny
cried
trying
to
free
herself
you
going
with
me
to
the
house
you
been
altogether
too
prying
now
you
take
your
punishment
both
of
you
the
gardener
might
have
managed
penny
alone
but
he
was
no
match
for
two
athletic
girls
as
he
tried
to
seize
louise
penny
twisted
free
quick
as
a
flash
she
grasped
the
man
felt
hat
jamming
it
down
on
his
head
over
his
eyes
while
he
was
trying
to
pull
it
off
louise
also
wriggled
from
his
grasp
the
two
girls
ran
to
the
water
edge
their
boat
had
drawn
close
to
shore
without
waiting
for
it
to
beach
they
waded
out
over
their
shoetops
and
climbed
aboard
do
either
of
you
ever
come
here
again
the
gardener
hurled
after
them
if
you
do
the
rest
of
the
threat
was
carried
away
by
the
wind
however
penny
could
not
resist
waving
her
hand
and
calling
back
bye
bye
old
timer
be
seeing
you
what
the
matter
with
that
man
anyhow
asked
the
boy
who
rowed
the
boat
did
he
want
you
on
the
estate
on
the
contrary
he
invited
us
to
remain
and
we
declined
grinned
penny
just
temperament
that
all
he
ca
make
up
his
mind
which
way
he
would
like
to
have
it
allowing
the
boy
to
puzzle
over
the
remark
she
busied
herself
pouring
water
from
her
sodden
shoes
the
visit
to
the
estate
had
not
turned
out
at
all
as
she
had
planned
she
had
failed
to
talk
with
miss
kippenberg
and
it
was
almost
certain
that
from
now
on
servants
would
keep
a
much
closer
watch
for
intruders
the
only
vital
information
she
had
gleaned
resulted
from
overhearing
the
conversation
between
sylvia
kippenberg
and
the
gardener
she
talked
with
him
as
if
they
were
well
acquainted
mused
penny
miss
kippenberg
must
have
thought
he
knew
more
about
grant
disappearance
than
he
would
tell
and
she
seems
to
be
afraid
the
law
will
ask
too
many
questions
otherwise
she
would
have
suggested
getting
rid
of
the
alligator
one
additional
observation
penny
had
made
but
she
decided
not
to
speak
of
it
until
she
and
louise
were
alone
the
boat
reached
shore
and
the
two
girls
stepped
out
on
the
muddy
bank
will
you
need
me
again
inquired
the
boy
i
may
said
penny
and
i
ca
tell
you
exactly
when
where
do
you
keep
your
boat
up
the
river
just
beyond
that
crooked
maple
tree
i
hide
it
in
the
bushes
and
i
keep
the
oars
inside
a
hollow
log
close
by
you
wo
have
any
trouble
finding
it
penny
and
louise
said
goodbye
to
the
lad
and
scrambled
up
the
bank
i
sure
i
not
be
going
back
to
place
the
latter
declared
emphatically
i
just
wonder
what
would
have
happened
if
we
had
broken
away
we
might
have
been
locked
up
in
the
stone
tower
penny
laughed
then
another
one
of
my
theories
would
have
proven
itself
oh
you
and
your
theories
you
ca
make
me
believe
that
gardener
did
mean
to
harm
us
he
was
a
very
sinister
character
sinister
is
a
strong
word
lou
but
i
agree
he
not
any
ordinary
gardener
either
he
been
hired
by
the
kippenberg
family
for
a
very
special
purpose
or
else
he
gained
their
confidence
and
means
to
bend
them
to
his
own
ends
his
own
ends
why
penny
what
do
you
mean
have
you
learned
something
you
have
told
me
only
this
i
satisfied
old
peter
is
no
gardener
he
wearing
a
disguise
well
what
wo
you
think
of
next
you
been
reading
too
many
detective
stories
penny
parker
have
i
then
there
no
need
to
tell
you
yes
there
is
louise
cut
in
your
ideas
are
pretty
imaginative
but
i
like
to
hear
them
anyway
considerate
of
you
old
thing
penny
drawled
in
her
best
imitation
of
an
english
accent
you
do
deserve
to
be
told
after
that
crack
but
i
do
it
anyhow
when
i
pulled
the
gardener
hat
down
over
his
eyes
i
felt
something
slip
maybe
it
was
his
skin
peeling
off
he
wore
a
wig
penny
said
soberly
that
why
he
looked
so
startled
when
i
jerked
the
hat
did
you
actually
see
a
wig
no
but
he
must
have
had
one
on
his
head
i
felt
it
give
i
tell
you
i
would
put
anything
past
that
fellow
but
if
he
is
a
gardener
then
who
or
what
is
he
i
do
know
but
i
intend
to
do
some
intensive
investigation
just
how
may
i
ask
penny
gazed
speculatively
toward
the
drawbridge
noting
that
the
old
watchman
had
been
deserted
by
the
group
of
reporters
he
sat
alone
legs
crossed
his
camp
stool
propped
against
the
side
of
the
gearhouse
let
talk
with
him
lou
he
might
be
able
to
tell
us
something
about
the
different
employees
of
the
estate
they
walked
over
to
where
the
old
man
sat
greeting
him
with
their
most
pleasant
smiles
good
morning
said
penny
the
old
man
finished
lighting
his
pipe
before
he
deigned
to
notice
them
good
morning
repeated
penny
mornin
said
the
watchman
he
looked
the
two
girls
over
appraisingly
and
added
ai
you
children
a
long
ways
off
from
your
ma
the
remark
both
startled
and
offended
penny
but
instantly
she
divined
that
the
old
fellow
memory
was
short
and
his
eyesight
poor
he
had
failed
to
recognize
her
in
everyday
clothes
oh
we
just
out
for
a
hike
she
answered
you
see
we
get
tired
of
all
the
ordinary
places
so
we
thought
we
would
walk
by
here
we
interested
in
your
bridge
added
louise
we
just
love
bridges
this
one
ai
so
good
any
more
the
old
man
said
disparagingly
does
it
get
lonely
here
ventured
louise
sitting
here
all
day
long
it
did
at
first
miss
but
i
got
used
to
it
anyway
it
beats
leanin
on
a
shovel
for
the
i
got
a
little
garden
over
yonder
a
ways
you
ought
to
see
my
tomatoes
them
ponderosas
is
as
big
as
a
plate
do
you
ever
operate
the
bridge
louise
inquired
for
penny
had
not
told
her
that
the
structure
was
still
in
use
oh
sure
miss
that
what
i
here
for
but
it
ai
safe
for
heavier
than
a
passenger
car
i
love
to
see
the
bridge
lowered
louise
stared
curiously
up
at
the
tall
cantilevers
which
pointed
skyward
when
will
you
do
it
next
time
davis
if
you
please
miss
thorny
davis
they
calls
me
my
real
thorndyke
the
old
man
pulled
a
large
silver
watch
from
his
pocket
and
consulted
it
in
about
ten
minutes
now
kippenberg
will
be
comin
back
from
town
then
we
make
the
old
hinge
bend
down
agin
let
wait
said
louise
penny
nodded
and
then
as
thorny
did
not
seem
to
object
she
peeped
into
the
gear
house
the
door
of
which
stood
half
open
a
maze
of
machinery
met
her
eye
an
electric
motor
and
several
long
presently
thorny
davis
listened
intently
penny
thought
he
looked
like
an
old
fox
who
had
picked
up
the
distant
baying
of
the
pack
that
car
now
he
said
i
can
tell
by
the
sound
of
the
engine
well
i
reckon
i
might
as
well
let
down
thorny
arose
and
knocked
the
ashes
from
his
pipe
he
opened
the
door
of
the
gear
house
and
stepped
inside
may
i
see
how
you
do
it
asked
penny
i
always
was
interested
in
machinery
the
women
will
be
runnin
locomotives
next
thorny
complained
whimsically
all
right
come
on
in
the
old
watchman
pulled
a
lever
on
the
starting
rheostat
of
the
motor
which
responded
with
a
sudden
jar
and
then
a
low
purr
it
increased
its
speed
as
he
pushed
the
lever
all
the
way
over
now
the
power
on
the
next
thing
is
to
drop
thorny
grasped
one
of
the
long
and
gently
eased
it
forward
there
was
a
grind
of
gears
engaging
and
the
bridge
slowly
crept
down
out
of
the
sky
penny
did
not
miss
a
single
move
she
noted
just
which
levers
the
watchman
pulled
and
in
what
order
when
the
platform
of
the
bridge
was
on
an
even
keel
she
saw
him
cut
off
the
motor
and
throw
all
the
gear
back
into
its
original
position
think
you
could
do
by
yourself
now
thorny
asked
yes
i
believe
i
could
penny
answered
gravely
the
old
watchman
smiled
as
he
stepped
to
the
deck
of
the
bridge
it
ai
so
easy
as
it
looks
he
told
her
well
here
comes
the
missuz
now
and
we
all
ready
for
her
last
time
she
came
along
i
was
out
my
corn
patch
and
was
she
mad
as
the
black
limousine
rolled
up
to
the
drawbridge
penny
turned
her
face
away
so
that
kippenberg
would
not
recognize
her
she
need
have
had
no
uneasiness
for
the
lady
gazed
neither
to
the
right
nor
the
left
the
car
crept
forward
at
a
snail
pace
causing
the
steel
structure
to
shiver
and
shake
as
if
from
an
attack
of
ague
dear
me
i
think
this
bridge
is
positively
dangerous
louise
declared
i
should
like
to
drive
over
it
myself
as
the
old
watchman
again
raised
the
cantilevers
penny
studied
his
every
move
for
a
girl
you
sure
mighty
interested
in
machinery
he
remarked
oh
i
may
grow
up
to
be
a
bridgeman
some
day
penny
said
lightly
i
notice
you
keep
the
gear
house
locked
part
of
the
time
i
have
to
do
it
or
folks
would
tamper
with
the
machinery
the
old
man
snapped
a
padlock
on
the
door
now
i
goin
to
mosey
down
to
my
garden
and
do
a
little
hoein
he
announced
you
girls
better
run
along
thus
dismissed
louise
started
away
but
penny
made
no
move
to
leave
she
intended
to
ask
a
few
questions
thorny
are
you
any
relation
to
the
kippenberg
head
gardener
she
inquired
with
startling
abruptness
am
i
any
relation
to
that
old
walrus
thorny
fairly
shouted
am
i
any
relation
to
say
you
tryin
to
insult
me
not
at
all
but
i
saw
the
man
this
morning
and
i
fancied
i
noticed
a
resemblance
perhaps
you
do
know
the
one
i
mean
sure
i
know
him
all
right
thorny
spat
contemptuously
new
man
he
acts
as
and
bossy
as
if
he
owned
the
whole
place
then
you
do
like
him
there
ai
no
one
that
has
anything
to
do
with
him
he
so
good
he
ca
live
like
the
rest
of
the
servants
where
do
you
think
i
seen
him
the
other
night
i
have
the
slightest
idea
where
he
was
at
the
colonial
hotel
eatin
in
the
main
dining
room
the
colonial
is
quite
an
expensive
hotel
at
corbin
is
it
best
there
is
they
soak
you
two
bucks
just
to
park
your
feet
under
one
of
their
tables
yep
if
you
ask
me
kippenberg
better
ask
that
gardener
of
hers
a
few
questions
having
delivered
himself
of
this
tirade
thorny
became
calm
again
he
shifted
his
weight
and
said
pointedly
well
i
got
to
tend
my
garden
you
girls
better
run
along
kippenberg
do
want
nobody
around
the
bridge
the
girls
obligingly
took
leave
of
him
and
walked
away
but
when
they
were
some
distance
away
penny
glanced
back
over
her
shoulder
she
saw
thorny
down
on
his
hands
and
knees
in
front
of
the
gear
house
he
was
slipping
some
object
under
the
wide
crack
of
the
door
the
key
to
the
padlock
she
chuckled
so
that
was
why
he
wanted
us
to
leave
first
we
remember
the
hiding
place
lou
just
in
case
we
ever
decide
to
use
the
drawbridge
chapter
search
for
after
leaving
the
kippenberg
estate
penny
and
louise
motored
to
corbin
more
from
curiosity
than
for
any
other
reason
they
dined
at
the
colonial
hotel
finding
the
establishment
as
luxurious
as
the
old
watchman
had
intimated
a
full
hour
and
a
half
was
required
to
eat
the
fine
dinner
which
was
served
our
friend
the
gardener
does
have
excellent
taste
in
food
remarked
louise
what
puzzles
me
is
where
does
he
get
the
money
to
pay
for
all
this
the
obvious
answer
is
that
he
not
a
gardener
maybe
he
has
rooms
here
too
penny
i
been
wondering
about
it
i
mean
to
investigate
louise
glanced
at
her
wristwatch
do
you
think
we
should
take
the
time
she
asked
it
will
be
late
afternoon
now
before
we
reach
home
oh
it
wo
take
a
minute
to
inquire
at
the
desk
leaving
the
dining
room
the
girls
made
their
way
to
the
lobby
when
the
desk
clerk
had
a
free
moment
penny
asked
him
if
anyone
by
the
name
of
peter
henderson
had
taken
rooms
at
the
hotel
no
one
here
by
that
name
the
man
told
her
wait
i
look
to
be
sure
he
consulted
a
card
filing
system
which
served
as
a
register
and
confirmed
his
first
statement
the
man
i
mean
would
be
around
sixty
years
of
age
explained
penny
he
works
as
a
gardener
at
the
kippenberg
estate
perhaps
you
have
come
to
the
wrong
hotel
said
the
clerk
aloofly
we
do
not
cater
to
gardeners
only
to
people
who
employ
gardeners
i
take
it
our
rates
start
at
ten
dollars
a
day
returned
the
clerk
coldly
and
does
that
include
free
linen
and
a
bath
penny
asked
with
pretended
awe
certainly
all
of
our
rooms
have
private
baths
how
wonderful
giggled
penny
we
thought
this
might
be
one
of
those
places
with
a
bath
on
every
floor
suddenly
comprehending
that
he
was
being
made
an
object
of
sport
the
clerk
glared
at
the
girls
and
turned
his
back
penny
and
louise
went
cheerfully
to
their
car
very
much
pleased
with
themselves
for
having
deflated
such
a
conceited
young
man
they
drove
away
and
late
afternoon
brought
them
to
riverview
tired
and
dusty
from
their
long
trip
after
dropping
her
chum
off
at
the
sidell
home
penny
rode
directly
to
the
newspaper
office
finding
no
parking
place
available
on
the
street
she
ran
her
car
into
the
loading
area
at
the
rear
of
the
building
nosing
into
a
narrow
space
which
had
just
been
vacated
by
a
truck
hey
you
lady
shouted
an
employee
you
ca
park
that
scrap
iron
here
another
paper
truck
will
be
along
in
a
minute
penny
switched
off
the
engine
i
guess
you
new
around
here
she
said
climbing
out
the
next
truck
is
due
until
say
who
do
you
think
you
are
tellin
me
the
employee
trailed
off
into
silence
as
another
workman
gave
him
a
sharp
nudge
in
the
ribs
pipe
down
he
was
warned
if
the
boss
daughter
wants
to
park
her
jitney
in
the
paper
chute
it
okay
see
sure
i
get
it
the
other
mumbled
penny
grinned
broadly
as
she
crossed
the
loading
area
after
this
you
might
mention
my
automobile
in
a
more
respectful
tone
she
tossed
over
her
shoulder
it
not
scrap
iron
or
a
jitney
either
riding
up
the
freight
elevator
penny
passed
a
few
remarks
with
the
smiling
operator
and
stepped
off
at
the
editorial
floor
she
noticed
as
she
went
through
the
news
room
that
jerry
livingston
desk
was
vacant
and
because
the
waste
basket
was
empty
the
floor
beside
it
free
from
paper
wads
she
knew
he
had
written
no
story
that
day
penny
tapped
lightly
on
the
closed
door
of
her
father
private
office
and
went
in
hello
he
said
glancing
up
just
get
back
from
corbin
yes
louise
and
i
had
plenty
of
excitement
but
i
did
dig
up
any
facts
you
dare
print
in
the
paper
did
you
meet
jerry
anywhere
why
no
dad
the
young
cub
is
taking
a
vacation
at
my
expense
running
up
a
big
motorboat
bill
he
should
have
been
back
here
three
hours
ago
oh
be
reasonable
dad
said
penny
teasingly
you
ca
expect
him
to
trace
down
those
men
just
in
a
minute
it
was
a
wild
chase
anyway
the
editor
growled
i
let
him
do
it
more
to
please
you
than
for
any
other
reason
but
that
beside
the
point
he
was
told
to
be
back
here
by
four
at
the
latest
even
if
he
had
nothing
to
report
jerry
is
usually
punctual
dad
but
i
suppose
being
on
the
river
he
could
get
here
just
when
he
expected
he
probably
gone
fishing
parker
declared
he
slammed
down
the
roll
top
on
his
desk
and
picked
up
his
hat
will
you
ride
home
with
me
penny
invited
leaping
lena
would
be
highly
honored
it
a
mighty
sight
more
comfortable
on
the
bus
her
father
replied
but
then
i
can
stand
a
jolting
as
they
went
out
through
the
main
room
he
paused
to
speak
with
dewitt
leaving
an
order
that
he
was
to
be
called
at
his
home
as
soon
as
jerry
livingston
returned
parker
raised
his
eyebrows
as
he
saw
where
penny
had
left
the
car
have
i
told
you
that
the
trucks
need
this
space
to
load
and
unload
he
asked
patiently
there
is
a
ten
cent
parking
lot
across
the
street
but
dad
i
have
ten
cents
to
spare
the
truth
is
i
spent
almost
every
bit
of
my
allowance
today
over
at
corbin
no
said
parker
firmly
no
no
what
not
a
penny
will
you
get
ahead
of
time
you
misjudge
me
dad
i
had
no
intention
of
even
mentioning
such
a
painful
subject
they
drove
in
silence
for
a
few
blocks
and
then
penny
indicated
the
gasoline
gauge
on
the
dashboard
why
it
nearly
empty
she
exclaimed
we
wo
have
enough
to
reach
home
well
get
some
said
parker
automatically
we
do
want
to
stall
on
the
street
a
flip
of
the
steering
wheel
brought
the
car
to
a
standstill
in
front
of
a
gasoline
pump
fill
it
up
ordered
penny
while
parker
read
his
newspaper
the
attendant
polished
the
windshield
and
checked
the
oil
finding
it
low
at
a
nod
from
penny
he
added
two
quarts
that
will
be
exactly
two
penny
repeated
the
figure
in
a
louder
tone
giving
her
father
a
nudge
wake
up
dad
two
absently
parker
reached
for
his
wallet
not
until
the
attendant
brought
the
change
did
it
dawn
upon
him
that
penny
had
scored
once
more
tricked
again
he
groaned
why
it
was
your
own
suggestion
that
we
stop
for
gasoline
penny
reminded
him
i
should
have
minded
taking
a
chance
myself
you
see
the
gauge
is
usually
at
least
a
gallon
off
anyway
i
would
rather
pay
for
it
than
have
you
siphon
it
out
of
my
car
thanks
for
the
present
laughed
penny
dinner
was
waiting
by
the
time
they
reached
home
afterwards
penny
helped
weems
with
the
dishes
while
her
father
mowed
the
lawn
hearing
the
telephone
ring
he
came
to
the
kitchen
door
was
that
a
call
for
me
he
asked
no
dad
it
was
for
mrs
weems
strange
dewitt
does
call
parker
said
i
believe
i
telephone
him
after
weems
had
finished
with
the
phone
he
called
the
newspaper
office
only
to
be
told
that
jerry
livingston
had
not
put
in
an
appearance
at
least
he
might
have
communicated
with
the
office
parker
said
as
he
hung
up
the
receiver
he
went
back
to
lawn
mowing
but
paused
now
and
then
to
stare
moodily
toward
the
kobalt
river
which
wound
through
the
valley
far
below
the
terrace
penny
finished
drying
the
dishes
and
went
outside
to
join
him
you
worried
about
jerry
are
you
she
asked
after
a
moment
not
exactly
he
replied
but
he
should
have
been
back
long
ago
he
never
would
have
stayed
away
without
good
reason
we
both
know
jerry
is
like
that
no
he
either
run
into
a
big
story
or
he
in
trouble
when
i
sent
him
away
this
morning
i
did
look
upon
the
assignment
as
a
particularly
dangerous
one
and
yet
if
he
met
those
two
seamen
anything
could
have
happened
they
were
tough
customers
dad
i
could
notify
the
police
if
jerry
is
back
within
an
hour
or
two
parker
said
slowly
still
i
hate
to
do
it
where
did
jerry
rent
his
boat
dad
i
told
him
to
get
one
at
griffith
dock
at
street
then
why
do
we
go
there
suggested
penny
if
he
has
come
in
we
might
rent
a
boat
of
our
own
and
start
a
search
parker
debated
and
then
nodded
bring
a
heavy
coat
he
told
her
it
may
be
cold
on
the
river
penny
ran
into
the
house
after
the
garments
and
also
took
a
flashlight
from
her
father
bureau
drawer
when
she
hurried
outdoors
again
her
father
had
backed
his
own
car
from
the
garage
and
was
waiting
at
the
street
dock
harry
griffith
owner
of
the
boat
house
answered
their
questions
frankly
yes
he
told
them
jerry
livingston
had
rented
a
motor
boat
early
that
morning
but
had
not
returned
it
i
been
worryin
about
that
young
feller
he
admitted
and
then
with
a
quick
change
of
tone
say
you
not
parker
are
you
yes
that
my
name
then
i
got
a
letter
here
for
you
i
reckon
maybe
it
explains
what
became
of
the
young
feller
the
boatman
took
a
greasy
envelope
from
his
trousers
pocket
and
gave
it
to
the
editor
where
did
you
get
this
mr
griffith
a
boy
in
a
rowboat
brought
it
up
the
river
about
two
hours
ago
he
said
the
young
feller
gave
him
a
dollar
to
deliver
it
to
a
parker
but
the
kid
was
mixed
up
on
the
address
so
i
just
held
it
here
dad
it
must
be
from
jerry
said
penny
eagerly
as
her
father
opened
the
envelope
she
held
the
flashlight
close
in
an
almost
illegible
scrawl
jerry
had
written
following
up
a
hot
tip
think
i
struck
trail
of
key
men
taking
off
in
boat
expect
to
get
back
by
nightfall
unless
old
man
trouble
catches
up
with
me
parker
looked
up
from
the
message
his
gaze
meeting
the
frightened
eyes
of
his
daughter
oh
dad
she
said
in
a
tone
barely
above
a
whisper
it
long
after
dark
now
what
do
you
think
has
become
of
jerry
chapter
the
wasting
no
moments
in
useless
conversation
parker
rented
a
fast
motor
boat
and
prevailed
upon
harry
griffith
to
operate
it
for
him
guided
by
the
stars
and
a
half
moon
which
was
slowly
rising
over
the
treetops
the
party
swung
down
the
river
riding
with
the
current
they
came
before
long
to
the
locality
where
penny
and
jerry
had
first
sighted
the
two
seamen
cruiser
but
now
there
was
no
sign
of
a
boat
either
large
or
small
at
a
speed
which
enabled
the
occupants
to
scrutinize
the
shoreline
the
searching
craft
swept
on
the
river
had
never
seemed
more
deserted
jerry
might
have
stopped
anywhere
along
here
parker
observed
if
he
drew
the
boat
into
the
bushes
we
have
a
chance
of
finding
him
they
went
on
coming
presently
to
the
kippenberg
estate
as
they
passed
beneath
the
open
drawbridge
penny
noted
how
low
it
had
been
swung
over
the
water
a
boat
with
a
high
cabin
could
not
possibly
go
through
when
the
cantilevers
were
down
gazing
upward
she
saw
a
swinging
red
light
at
the
entrance
to
the
bridge
a
lantern
no
doubt
hung
there
to
give
warning
to
any
motorist
who
might
venture
upon
the
private
road
thorny
probably
is
on
duty
at
this
hour
penny
reflected
but
i
should
think
an
open
drawbridge
might
prove
more
dangerous
at
night
than
in
the
daytime
as
the
bridge
was
lost
to
view
beyond
a
bend
in
the
river
she
gave
all
her
attention
to
watching
the
coves
and
inlets
her
father
sat
hunched
over
in
the
seat
beside
her
slapping
at
mosquitoes
now
and
then
he
would
switch
on
the
flashlight
to
look
at
his
watch
gradually
the
river
had
widened
so
that
it
was
possible
to
cover
only
one
shore
we
search
the
other
side
on
our
return
trip
parker
said
but
it
looks
to
me
as
if
we
not
going
to
have
any
luck
as
if
to
add
to
the
discouragement
of
the
party
dark
clouds
began
to
edge
across
the
sky
one
by
one
the
stars
were
inked
out
penny
light
coat
offered
scant
protection
from
the
cold
wind
and
then
harry
griffith
throttled
down
the
motor
and
spun
the
wheel
sharply
to
starboard
he
leaned
forward
trying
to
pierce
the
black
void
ahead
of
the
boat
bright
beam
looks
like
something
over
there
he
said
pointing
might
be
a
log
no
it
a
boat
i
ca
see
anyone
in
it
penny
cried
it
drifting
with
the
current
that
looks
like
one
of
my
boats
sure
as
you
born
griffith
declared
idling
the
engine
the
same
i
rented
the
young
feller
this
morning
but
where
is
jerry
cried
penny
griffith
maneuvered
his
own
boat
close
to
the
one
which
drifted
with
the
current
parker
was
able
to
reach
out
and
grasp
the
long
rope
dangling
in
the
water
the
flashlight
penny
he
commanded
she
turned
the
beam
on
and
as
it
focused
upon
the
floor
of
the
boat
drew
in
her
breath
sharply
on
the
bottom
face
downward
lay
a
man
it
jerry
penny
cried
oh
dad
he
steady
said
her
father
steady
while
griffith
held
the
two
boats
together
he
stepped
aboard
the
smaller
one
he
bent
over
the
crumpled
figure
feeling
jerry
pulse
gently
turning
him
upon
his
back
is
he
alive
dad
his
pulse
is
weak
but
i
can
feel
it
yes
he
breathing
hold
that
light
steady
penny
dad
there
blood
on
his
head
i
i
can
see
it
trickling
down
he
been
struck
with
a
club
or
some
blunt
object
parker
said
grimly
he
may
have
a
fractured
skull
oh
dad
keep
a
grip
on
yourself
her
father
ordered
sternly
it
may
not
be
as
bad
as
i
think
but
we
have
to
rush
him
to
the
nearest
doctor
if
it
was
me
i
would
try
to
move
him
out
of
there
advised
harry
griffith
leave
him
where
he
is
i
get
aboard
and
we
take
this
boat
in
tow
penny
helped
the
man
make
their
craft
fast
to
the
other
boat
and
then
they
both
climbed
aboard
griffith
started
the
engine
and
turned
around
in
the
river
i
head
for
covert
he
said
that
about
the
closest
place
there
ought
to
be
a
good
doctor
in
a
town
that
size
while
griffith
handled
the
boat
penny
and
her
father
did
what
they
could
to
make
jerry
comfortable
they
stripped
off
their
coats
using
one
for
a
pillow
and
the
other
to
cover
his
body
those
two
men
he
was
sent
to
follow
must
be
responsible
for
this
penny
murmured
how
could
they
do
such
a
brutal
thing
i
notify
the
police
as
soon
as
we
touch
shore
her
father
said
grimly
we
search
every
cove
and
inlet
until
we
find
the
ones
responsible
as
he
spoke
parker
bent
lower
to
examine
the
wound
on
jerry
head
blood
had
nearly
stopped
flowing
and
he
was
hopeful
that
it
came
from
a
flesh
wound
he
pressed
a
clean
handkerchief
against
it
and
the
young
man
stirred
how
long
do
you
suppose
he
been
like
this
dad
hard
to
tell
an
hour
maybe
two
hours
presently
as
the
boat
made
full
speed
up
the
river
jerry
stirred
once
more
his
lips
moved
but
the
words
were
indistinguishable
how
far
to
covert
parker
asked
anxiously
about
four
miles
from
this
point
griffith
flung
over
his
shoulder
it
the
next
town
above
the
kippenberg
estate
i
making
the
best
time
i
can
jerry
moved
restlessly
his
hands
plucking
at
the
coat
which
covered
him
flaming
eyes
he
muttered
looking
at
me
looking
at
me
penny
and
her
father
gazed
at
each
other
in
startled
dismay
he
completely
out
of
his
head
whispered
penny
he
gone
back
to
that
other
accident
which
happened
last
year
nodded
parker
the
vanishing
houseboat
affair
jerry
had
more
than
his
share
of
bad
luck
dad
twice
now
on
this
same
river
he
met
with
disaster
and
this
time
he
may
not
come
through
i
think
he
will
if
his
skull
has
been
fractured
parker
told
her
encouragingly
listen
jerry
lips
were
moving
again
and
this
time
his
words
were
more
rational
got
to
get
word
to
the
chief
they
heard
him
mutter
got
to
get
word
a
long
while
after
that
jerry
remained
perfectly
quiet
suddenly
arousing
his
eyes
opened
wide
and
he
struggled
to
sit
up
parker
gently
pressed
him
back
where
am
i
jerry
muttered
let
me
out
of
here
let
me
out
quiet
jerry
soothed
parker
you
with
friends
the
reporter
tense
grip
on
the
editor
hand
relaxed
that
you
chief
yes
jerry
just
lie
quiet
we
have
you
to
a
doctor
in
a
few
more
minutes
doctor
i
do
need
any
doctor
he
protested
trying
once
more
to
sit
up
what
happened
anyway
that
what
we
would
like
to
know
ca
you
remember
anything
jerry
penny
asked
you
went
out
on
the
river
to
try
to
trace
those
two
men
in
the
cruiser
oh
it
coming
back
to
me
now
i
ran
into
their
boat
down
by
cranberry
cove
they
tied
up
there
and
then
what
happened
penny
demanded
as
jerry
paused
i
saw
walk
ashore
thought
i
would
follow
so
i
tied
up
my
boat
too
they
started
off
through
the
trees
pretty
soon
they
met
a
third
man
a
well
dressed
fellow
educated
too
did
you
hear
any
of
their
conversation
parker
questioned
i
heard
kippenberg
name
mentioned
that
caught
my
interest
so
i
crept
closer
must
have
given
myself
away
because
that
about
the
last
i
remember
a
ton
of
dynamite
seemed
to
explode
in
my
head
and
here
i
am
obviously
you
were
struck
from
behind
with
some
heavy
object
parker
said
they
probably
dumped
you
back
in
your
own
boat
and
set
it
adrift
you
never
saw
your
attacker
no
jerry
rested
for
a
moment
and
then
as
it
dawned
upon
him
that
he
was
being
speeded
to
a
doctor
he
began
to
protest
say
chief
i
be
all
right
i
do
need
any
doc
head
clear
as
a
bell
now
that
fine
jerry
but
you
see
a
doctor
anyway
and
have
we
taking
no
chances
then
at
least
let
me
go
back
to
riverview
jerry
grumbled
i
want
to
be
stuck
in
any
hick
town
hospital
if
you
feel
equal
to
the
trip
i
guess
we
can
grant
you
that
much
you
seem
to
be
all
right
but
i
want
to
make
sure
ca
take
chances
on
the
paper
being
sued
later
on
you
know
oh
i
get
the
idea
said
jerry
with
a
grimace
thinking
of
the
old
cash
register
as
usual
penny
drew
a
deep
sigh
of
relief
if
jerry
were
able
to
make
jokes
he
could
be
seriously
injured
she
still
felt
weak
from
the
fright
she
had
received
the
police
will
find
those
men
who
attacked
you
she
told
him
i
hope
they
put
in
prison
for
life
too
the
police
jerry
repeated
he
stared
up
into
parker
face
say
chief
you
not
aiming
to
spill
the
story
are
you
i
was
but
see
here
if
you
notify
the
police
we
show
our
hand
to
the
rival
paper
if
we
keep
this
dark
we
could
do
our
own
investigating
and
maybe
land
a
big
scoop
justice
is
more
important
than
a
scoop
jerry
returned
parker
if
those
men
had
anything
to
do
with
atherwald
disappearance
and
it
looks
as
if
they
did
then
we
are
duty
bound
to
hand
our
clues
over
to
the
police
by
trying
to
handle
it
alone
we
might
let
them
escape
guess
maybe
you
right
at
that
jerry
acknowledged
as
she
saw
that
the
reporter
was
rapidly
recovering
strength
penny
left
him
to
the
care
of
her
father
and
went
forward
to
speak
with
harry
griffith
where
are
we
now
she
inquired
just
comin
to
the
kippenberg
estate
he
told
her
only
that
far
we
do
seem
to
be
making
very
fast
time
we
buckin
the
current
miss
and
there
a
right
stiff
wind
blowing
she
had
not
noticed
the
wind
before
or
how
overcast
the
sky
had
become
one
could
not
see
many
yards
in
advance
of
the
boat
ahead
loomed
the
drawbridge
in
open
position
as
usual
but
penny
could
not
see
the
red
lantern
which
she
had
noticed
upon
the
trip
down
had
the
light
been
blown
out
by
the
wind
in
any
case
it
would
not
greatly
matter
she
reflected
few
cars
traveled
the
private
road
and
any
person
who
came
that
way
would
likely
know
about
the
bridge
and
then
above
the
steady
hum
of
the
motor
boat
engine
penny
heard
another
roar
which
steadily
increased
in
intensity
a
car
was
coming
down
the
road
at
great
speed
the
lantern
must
be
there
penny
thought
it
probably
hidden
by
a
tree
or
the
high
bank
of
course
it
there
she
listened
with
a
growing
tension
the
car
was
not
slowing
down
even
harry
griffith
turned
his
head
to
gaze
toward
the
entrance
ramp
of
the
drawbridge
it
was
all
over
in
an
instant
a
scream
of
brakes
a
loud
splintering
of
the
wooden
barrier
the
speeding
automobile
struck
the
side
of
the
steel
bridge
spun
sideways
and
careened
down
the
bank
to
bury
itself
in
the
water
chapter
daring
those
in
the
motor
boat
who
had
witnessed
the
disaster
were
too
horrified
to
speak
they
could
see
the
top
of
the
car
rising
above
the
water
into
which
it
had
fallen
but
there
was
no
sign
of
the
unfortunate
driver
or
other
possible
occupants
penny
began
to
kick
off
her
shoes
no
shouted
her
father
divining
her
purpose
no
it
too
dangerous
penny
did
not
heed
for
she
knew
that
if
the
persons
in
the
car
were
to
be
saved
it
must
be
by
her
efforts
her
father
could
not
swim
well
and
harry
griffith
was
needed
at
the
wheel
of
the
motor
boat
scrambling
to
the
gunwale
the
girl
dived
into
the
water
she
could
see
nothing
groping
her
way
to
the
overturned
coupe
she
grasped
a
door
handle
and
turned
it
all
her
strength
was
required
to
pull
the
door
open
her
breath
was
growing
short
now
she
worked
faster
with
frantic
haste
a
hand
clutched
her
own
before
she
could
protect
herself
she
felt
the
man
upon
her
clawing
fighting
trying
to
climb
her
shoulders
upward
to
the
blessed
air
his
grasp
was
loose
penny
ducked
out
of
it
but
held
fast
to
his
hand
she
braced
her
feet
against
the
body
of
the
car
and
pushed
they
both
shot
upward
to
the
surface
griffith
and
her
father
lifted
the
man
out
of
the
water
into
the
motor
boat
have
to
go
down
again
penny
gasped
there
may
be
others
she
dived
once
more
doubling
herself
into
a
tight
ball
and
giving
a
quick
upthrust
of
her
feet
which
sent
her
straight
to
the
bottom
she
swam
into
the
car
and
groped
about
on
the
seat
and
floor
finding
no
bodies
she
quickly
shot
to
the
surface
again
her
father
pulled
her
over
the
side
saying
curtly
good
work
penny
the
victim
she
had
saved
seemed
little
the
worse
for
his
ducking
with
griffith
help
he
had
divested
himself
of
his
heavy
coat
and
was
wringing
it
out
penny
had
obtained
no
clear
view
of
the
man
nor
did
she
ever
for
just
at
that
moment
jerry
raised
himself
to
a
sitting
position
he
stared
at
the
bedraggled
one
and
pointed
an
accusing
finger
that
the
fellow
he
cried
in
an
excited
voice
the
one
i
was
telling
you
about
the
man
took
one
look
at
jerry
and
gazed
quickly
about
by
this
time
the
motor
boat
had
drifted
close
to
shore
before
anyone
could
make
a
move
to
stop
him
the
man
hurled
himself
overboard
he
landed
on
his
feet
in
shallow
water
splashing
through
to
the
shore
he
scuttled
up
the
steep
bank
and
disappeared
in
the
darkness
do
let
him
get
away
shouted
jerry
he
the
same
fellow
i
saw
in
the
woods
you
certain
asked
parker
doubtfully
of
course
if
you
think
i
out
of
my
head
now
you
the
one
crazy
it
the
same
fellow
oh
if
i
could
get
out
of
this
boat
griffith
brought
the
craft
to
shore
i
see
if
i
can
overtake
him
he
said
but
he
probably
deep
in
the
woods
by
this
time
the
boatman
was
a
man
slow
on
his
feet
penny
and
her
father
were
not
surprised
when
he
came
back
twenty
minutes
later
to
report
he
had
been
unable
to
pick
up
the
trail
the
overturned
car
may
offer
a
clue
to
his
identity
parker
said
as
they
started
up
the
river
once
more
the
police
will
be
able
to
check
the
license
plates
i
wonder
what
the
man
was
doing
at
the
estate
penny
mused
she
groped
her
way
toward
the
cabin
thinking
that
she
would
divest
herself
of
some
of
her
wet
garments
suddenly
she
stopped
short
dad
that
fellow
took
off
his
coat
she
exclaimed
he
must
have
left
it
behind
it
somewhere
on
the
floor
harry
griffith
called
to
her
penny
found
the
sodden
garment
lying
almost
at
her
feet
she
straightened
it
out
and
searched
the
pockets
her
father
moved
over
to
her
side
any
clues
he
asked
penny
took
out
a
handkerchief
a
key
ring
and
a
plain
white
envelope
that
may
be
something
exclaimed
parker
handle
it
carefully
so
it
does
tear
they
carried
the
articles
into
the
cabin
parker
turned
on
the
light
and
took
the
envelope
from
his
daughter
hand
they
were
both
elated
to
see
that
another
paper
was
contained
inside
parker
tore
off
the
envelope
and
flattened
the
letter
on
the
table
beneath
the
light
the
ink
had
blurred
but
nearly
all
of
the
words
could
still
be
made
out
there
was
no
heading
merely
the
initials
could
that
mean
james
kippenberg
penny
asked
the
message
was
brief
parker
read
it
aloud
better
come
through
or
your
fate
will
be
the
same
as
atherwald
we
give
you
hours
to
think
it
over
how
strange
penny
exclaimed
that
man
i
pulled
out
of
the
water
could
have
been
james
kippenberg
not
likely
penny
my
guess
would
be
that
he
had
been
sent
here
to
deliver
this
warning
note
being
unfamiliar
with
the
road
and
not
knowing
about
the
dangerous
drawbridge
he
crashed
through
but
james
kippenberg
is
supposed
to
be
at
the
estate
penny
argued
it
does
make
sense
at
all
this
much
is
clear
penny
jerry
saw
the
man
talking
with
the
two
seamen
and
they
all
appear
to
be
mixed
up
in
grant
disappearance
we
print
what
we
learned
and
let
the
police
figure
out
the
rest
dad
this
story
is
developing
into
something
big
is
it
he
nodded
as
he
moved
a
swinging
light
bulb
slowly
over
the
paper
hastening
the
drying
process
after
the
next
issue
of
the
is
printed
every
paper
in
the
state
will
send
their
men
here
but
we
out
ahead
and
when
the
big
break
comes
we
may
get
that
first
too
oh
dad
if
only
we
can
count
yourself
out
of
the
case
from
now
on
young
lady
he
said
severely
you
scared
the
wits
out
of
me
tonight
risking
your
life
to
save
that
now
shed
those
wet
clothes
before
you
come
down
with
pneumonia
he
tossed
her
an
overcoat
a
sweater
and
a
crumpled
pair
of
slacks
which
griffith
had
found
under
one
of
the
boat
seats
leaving
the
cabin
he
closed
the
door
behind
him
penny
did
not
change
her
clothes
at
once
instead
she
sat
down
at
the
table
studying
the
warning
message
come
through
she
read
aloud
does
that
mean
kippenberg
is
supposed
to
pay
money
and
what
fate
did
atherwald
meet
chapter
important
those
same
questions
were
pounding
through
penny
mind
the
next
morning
when
she
read
the
first
edition
of
her
father
paper
propped
up
in
bed
with
pillows
she
perused
the
story
as
she
nibbled
at
the
buttered
muffins
on
her
breakfast
tray
is
there
anything
else
you
would
like
weems
inquired
hovering
near
no
i
quite
all
right
smiled
penny
not
even
a
head
cold
after
my
ducking
have
you
heard
about
jerry
your
father
said
he
was
doing
fine
did
he
leave
any
message
for
me
before
going
to
the
office
he
said
he
thought
you
should
stay
in
bed
all
day
dad
would
penny
pouted
well
i
feel
just
fine
i
getting
up
right
away
she
heaved
aside
the
bed
clothes
then
because
she
could
get
the
kippenberg
case
out
of
her
head
she
dressed
quickly
and
went
downstairs
she
was
going
out
the
front
door
when
weems
stopped
her
now
where
are
you
going
penny
penny
bright
eyes
twinkled
and
she
flashed
the
housekeeper
an
arch
provocative
smile
not
sure
just
where
i
going
she
replied
her
smooth
forehead
creasing
with
thought
but
if
dad
should
get
curious
you
can
tell
him
he
should
be
surprised
if
he
finds
me
visiting
with
the
kippenbergs
penny
you
not
going
there
again
why
not
i
after
a
story
for
the
and
i
mean
to
get
it
see
you
later
with
a
wave
of
her
hand
penny
walked
jauntily
off
a
few
moments
later
weems
heard
the
clatter
of
penny
leaping
lena
careening
down
the
street
in
the
direction
of
corbin
first
however
she
called
for
her
chum
louise
who
was
eager
to
accompany
her
on
the
long
ride
i
wo
be
able
to
stay
long
penny
said
louise
mother
wants
me
to
go
shopping
with
her
later
this
afternoon
that
all
right
responded
penny
as
the
old
car
bolted
along
the
road
if
i
get
delayed
you
can
take
leaping
lena
back
home
and
i
follow
later
on
with
both
girls
keeping
up
a
steady
run
of
conversation
they
soon
reached
their
destination
penny
wondered
if
she
would
be
able
to
enter
the
kippenberg
estate
without
being
challenged
by
the
bridgeman
or
a
servant
her
anxiety
increased
upon
approaching
the
river
for
she
saw
that
a
large
group
of
persons
had
gathered
by
the
drawbridge
no
one
paid
the
slightest
attention
to
the
two
girls
as
they
abandoned
the
car
and
proceeded
to
the
water
edge
penny
was
pleased
to
find
the
youthful
boatman
at
his
usual
haunt
on
the
river
he
rowed
the
girls
across
to
the
estate
promising
to
await
their
return
penny
escorted
louise
through
the
trees
to
the
kippenberg
house
boldly
she
rang
the
doorbell
which
was
answered
by
a
butler
i
should
like
to
speak
with
kippenberg
she
requested
madam
will
see
no
one
began
the
man
footsteps
sounded
behind
him
in
the
hallway
and
kippenberg
stood
in
the
door
so
it
is
you
she
asked
in
an
icy
voice
julius
see
that
this
person
is
ejected
from
the
grounds
one
moment
please
interposed
penny
if
i
leave
now
i
warn
you
that
certain
facts
will
be
published
in
the
facts
which
will
add
to
your
embarrassment
you
can
print
nothing
which
will
humiliate
us
further
no
you
might
like
to
have
me
mention
the
alligator
in
your
lily
pool
and
the
reason
why
you
and
your
daughter
are
so
anxious
to
be
rid
of
it
before
the
police
ask
questions
kippenberg
plump
face
flushed
a
deep
red
but
for
once
she
managed
to
keep
her
temper
what
do
you
wish
of
me
she
asked
frigidly
first
tell
me
about
that
painting
drawbridge
which
was
presented
to
your
daughter
as
a
wedding
gift
was
it
not
given
to
her
by
your
husband
i
shall
not
answer
your
question
then
you
prefer
that
i
print
my
own
conclusions
you
are
an
impudent
prying
young
woman
kippenberg
stormed
what
if
the
picture
was
given
to
sylvia
by
her
father
is
that
any
crime
certainly
not
said
penny
soothingly
it
merely
proves
that
you
both
know
the
whereabouts
of
mr
kippenberg
perhaps
i
do
but
i
tell
you
nothing
absolutely
nothing
i
have
a
few
questions
to
ask
about
your
new
gardener
penny
went
on
unmoved
for
instance
why
does
he
wear
a
wig
the
door
slammed
in
her
face
that
certainly
was
a
very
cold
reception
remarked
louise
as
the
girls
walked
away
the
sound
of
the
slamming
door
still
ringing
in
their
ears
penny
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
smiled
that
nothing
when
you
a
reporter
you
have
to
expect
those
things
she
looked
about
the
deserted
estate
well
i
think
i
do
some
more
sleuthing
in
the
vicinity
of
the
pool
louise
looked
at
her
wristwatch
goodness
it
getting
late
she
stated
i
like
to
stay
penny
but
i
think
i
better
be
getting
home
to
meet
mother
go
ahead
said
penny
you
take
leaping
lena
the
boy
in
the
boat
will
row
you
across
but
how
will
you
get
home
then
do
worry
about
me
i
find
a
way
you
just
go
on
i
only
hope
the
old
bus
holds
up
all
the
way
home
louise
laughed
and
then
the
two
girls
walked
to
the
boat
dock
in
a
few
moments
the
boy
in
the
rowboat
appeared
and
took
louise
across
afterward
penny
turned
back
through
the
trees
and
went
on
to
the
forbidden
part
of
the
estate
she
spent
a
long
time
about
the
pool
examining
the
earth
all
about
it
but
she
failed
to
learn
anything
new
finally
she
retraced
her
steps
to
the
river
she
expected
to
find
the
boy
waiting
for
her
but
he
had
disappeared
she
walked
through
the
trees
to
the
boat
dock
and
stood
there
until
the
old
watchman
on
the
other
side
observed
her
predicament
he
obligingly
lowered
the
drawbridge
and
she
crossed
the
river
pausing
at
the
gear
house
to
chat
with
him
penny
listened
without
comment
to
his
story
of
the
automobile
accident
thorny
had
his
own
version
of
how
it
had
occurred
and
she
did
not
correct
any
of
the
details
i
wish
i
had
a
way
to
get
into
corbin
she
remarked
when
he
had
finished
his
lengthy
account
if
you
walk
down
to
the
main
road
you
kin
catch
the
county
bus
he
told
her
it
runs
every
hour
a
long
hike
along
a
dusty
highway
an
equally
tedious
wait
at
a
crossroad
and
finally
penny
arrived
in
corbin
she
went
directly
to
the
colonial
hotel
placing
a
telephone
call
to
her
father
office
what
are
you
doing
in
corbin
penny
her
father
demanded
as
he
recognized
her
voice
penny
answered
him
eagerly
i
made
an
important
discovery
which
may
blow
your
case
higher
than
a
kite
no
i
ca
tell
you
anything
over
the
telephone
the
reason
i
am
calling
is
that
i
may
need
help
is
jerry
still
in
the
hospital
he
never
was
there
responded
her
father
i
could
make
him
go
he
and
salt
are
out
on
the
river
looking
for
the
men
who
cracked
him
over
the
head
i
expect
they
call
in
any
time
now
if
you
do
get
in
touch
with
jerry
ask
him
to
meet
me
at
the
colonial
hotel
urged
penny
i
have
a
hunch
the
big
story
is
about
to
break
in
any
event
i
need
a
ride
home
there
was
a
great
deal
more
to
the
conversation
with
parker
delivering
a
long
lecture
upon
the
proper
deportment
for
a
daughter
penny
closed
her
ears
murmuring
at
regular
intervals
yes
dad
and
finally
went
back
to
her
post
in
the
lobby
chapter
white
for
at
least
an
hour
she
waited
she
watched
the
clock
until
the
hands
pointed
to
six
tantalizing
odors
came
to
her
from
the
dining
room
but
she
resolutely
downed
her
hunger
she
did
not
wish
to
give
up
her
vigil
even
for
a
few
minutes
finally
penny
patience
was
rewarded
she
saw
a
man
moving
across
the
lobby
toward
the
desk
he
wore
tailored
clothes
and
a
felt
hat
yet
the
girl
recognized
him
at
a
glance
he
was
the
kippenberg
gardener
the
man
paused
at
the
desk
and
asked
for
a
key
good
evening
hammil
said
the
clerk
handing
it
over
penny
had
noted
that
the
key
was
taken
from
a
mailbox
which
bore
the
number
so
my
friend
the
gardener
has
an
alias
she
mused
several
of
them
perhaps
another
half
hour
elapsed
while
the
girl
waited
patiently
in
her
chair
each
time
the
elevator
descended
she
watched
the
people
alight
at
exactly
six
hammil
stepped
out
of
the
lift
and
without
glancing
toward
the
girl
dropped
his
key
on
the
desk
and
went
into
the
dining
room
the
clerk
busy
with
several
newcomers
at
the
hotel
did
not
notice
thinking
that
she
saw
her
chance
penny
slipped
from
her
chair
sidled
toward
the
desk
and
picked
up
the
key
her
heart
pounded
as
she
walked
toward
the
elevator
but
no
one
called
to
her
her
action
had
passed
unobserved
third
floor
said
penny
and
the
elevator
shot
upward
she
located
room
at
the
far
end
of
the
hall
and
with
a
quick
glance
in
both
directions
unlocked
the
door
and
entered
an
open
suitcase
lay
upon
the
luggage
rack
by
the
dresser
in
systematic
fashion
penny
went
through
it
finding
an
assortment
of
interesting
articles
a
revolver
and
two
wigs
one
of
gray
hair
the
other
black
there
were
no
letters
or
papers
nothing
to
positively
identify
the
owner
of
the
luggage
but
in
the
very
bottom
of
the
case
penny
came
upon
a
photograph
it
was
a
picture
of
sylvia
kippenberg
penny
slipped
the
picture
into
the
front
of
her
dress
hastily
replaced
everything
as
she
had
found
it
relocked
the
door
and
returned
to
the
lobby
as
she
went
toward
the
desk
intending
to
rid
herself
of
the
key
she
stopped
short
jerry
livingston
stood
there
talking
earnestly
with
the
clerk
but
i
was
told
to
come
here
she
heard
him
protest
there
was
a
girl
in
the
lobby
a
few
minutes
ago
the
clerk
replied
she
went
off
somewhere
no
here
i
am
jerry
penny
cried
the
reporter
turned
around
and
his
face
lighted
up
come
outside
jerry
penny
said
before
he
could
speak
i
have
a
great
deal
to
tell
you
and
i
have
some
news
of
my
own
returned
the
reporter
they
left
the
hotel
together
once
beyond
hearing
penny
made
a
complete
report
of
her
afternoon
adventure
and
showed
jerry
the
picture
of
sylvia
kippenberg
which
she
had
taken
from
room
now
for
my
story
said
jerry
i
located
a
place
not
far
from
here
where
those
two
seamen
buy
supplies
the
owner
of
the
store
told
me
they
tie
their
boat
up
there
nearly
every
night
where
is
salt
now
jerry
he
keeping
watch
at
the
place
i
came
into
town
to
telephone
the
office
your
father
said
i
was
to
stop
here
and
take
you
in
tow
you
not
starting
back
to
riverview
penny
asked
in
dismay
i
do
want
to
penny
i
have
a
feeling
our
big
story
is
just
about
ready
to
break
so
have
i
jerry
let
stay
with
it
i
explain
to
dad
when
we
get
home
then
let
be
on
our
way
the
reporter
said
crisply
no
telling
what
has
developed
while
i
been
in
town
in
the
press
car
the
couple
took
the
river
road
which
led
east
from
the
kippenberg
estate
as
they
bounced
along
making
all
possible
speed
jerry
told
penny
how
he
and
salt
had
traced
the
two
seamen
they
had
made
inquiry
all
along
the
river
and
quite
by
chance
had
encountered
a
fisherman
who
had
given
them
a
valuable
tip
but
so
many
rumors
are
false
jerry
penny
said
this
tip
was
straight
salt
and
i
found
the
white
cruiser
tied
up
at
the
dock
not
far
from
this
store
i
was
telling
you
about
we
been
watching
it
for
the
past
two
hours
and
salt
is
still
there
why
did
you
call
the
police
would
have
done
any
good
the
men
we
after
have
been
there
all
day
the
only
person
on
board
is
a
girl
a
girl
well
maybe
you
would
say
a
young
woman
about
i
guess
jerry
you
must
be
watching
the
wrong
boat
jerry
shook
his
head
as
he
drove
the
car
into
the
bushes
at
the
side
of
the
road
it
the
right
one
i
sure
of
it
well
we
here
penny
was
hard
pressed
to
keep
up
as
the
reporter
led
her
through
the
trees
down
to
the
winding
kobalt
river
they
found
salt
in
his
hiding
place
behind
a
large
boulder
anything
happen
since
i
left
jerry
demanded
salt
scarcely
noticed
penny
presence
save
to
give
her
a
quick
nod
of
welcome
you
got
back
just
in
time
he
replied
to
the
question
the
girl
went
away
a
minute
ago
took
a
basket
and
started
for
the
store
then
why
are
we
waiting
asked
jerry
come
on
we
take
a
look
inside
that
boat
someone
ought
to
stay
here
and
keep
watch
salt
returned
she
may
come
back
any
minute
you
elected
guard
then
penny
and
i
will
look
the
boat
over
and
see
what
we
can
find
if
the
girl
starts
back
whistle
darting
across
the
muddy
shore
penny
and
jerry
reached
the
dilapidated
boat
which
had
been
tied
up
at
the
end
of
a
sagging
dock
they
jumped
aboard
and
after
a
hasty
glance
over
the
deck
dived
down
into
the
cabin
the
room
was
dirty
and
in
great
disorder
boots
lay
on
the
floor
discarded
garments
were
scattered
about
and
a
musty
odor
prevailed
nothing
here
said
jerry
let
look
around
carefully
insisted
penny
we
may
find
something
crossing
the
cabin
she
opened
a
closet
door
save
for
a
pair
of
oilskins
which
hung
from
a
nail
it
was
quite
empty
listen
commanded
penny
suddenly
jerry
stood
absolutely
still
straining
to
hear
a
long
low
whistle
reached
his
ears
the
warning
signal
he
exclaimed
come
on
penny
we
getting
out
of
here
chapter
in
the
penny
opened
the
door
of
the
cabin
only
to
close
it
quickly
she
and
jerry
both
had
heard
men
voices
very
close
to
the
boat
it
too
late
she
whispered
those
men
have
come
back
not
the
girl
no
they
alone
but
we
in
a
trap
what
shall
we
do
we
could
make
a
dash
for
it
if
we
have
to
fight
our
way
out
salt
will
be
there
to
help
let
stick
and
see
what
happens
jerry
we
after
information
we
must
expect
to
take
a
chance
in
order
to
get
it
jerry
had
been
thinking
more
of
penny
safety
than
his
own
but
thus
urged
he
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
bolting
the
door
from
the
inside
a
low
rumble
of
voices
reached
the
couple
as
they
stood
with
ears
pressed
against
the
panel
but
they
were
unable
to
distinguish
words
then
presently
one
of
the
seamen
moved
close
to
the
companionway
i
get
it
jake
he
called
it
down
in
the
cabin
jerry
and
penny
kept
quiet
as
the
man
turned
the
door
knob
he
heaved
angrily
against
the
panel
with
his
shoulder
hey
jake
he
shouted
what
the
idea
of
locking
the
door
i
did
lock
it
then
flora
did
muttering
under
his
breath
the
seaman
tramped
back
up
on
deck
perhaps
ten
minutes
elapsed
before
penny
and
jerry
heard
a
feminine
voice
speaking
that
must
be
flora
whispered
penny
what
will
happen
when
she
tells
them
that
she
did
lock
the
door
the
voices
above
rose
louder
and
louder
until
the
two
prisoners
were
able
to
distinguish
some
of
the
words
jake
berated
the
girl
as
stupid
while
his
companion
showered
abuse
upon
her
until
she
broke
down
and
wept
i
never
had
the
key
they
heard
her
wail
i
do
know
what
became
of
it
you
always
blame
me
for
everything
that
goes
wrong
and
i
good
and
sick
of
it
if
i
do
get
better
treatment
i
may
tell
a
few
things
to
the
police
how
would
you
like
that
jerry
and
penny
did
not
hear
the
response
but
they
recoiled
as
a
loud
crashing
sound
told
them
the
girl
had
been
given
a
cruel
push
into
a
solid
object
her
cry
of
pain
was
drowned
out
by
another
noise
the
sudden
clatter
of
the
motor
boat
engine
penny
and
jerry
gazed
at
each
other
with
startled
eyes
we
moving
she
whispered
jerry
started
to
fit
the
key
into
the
door
lock
only
to
have
penny
arrest
his
hand
let
stay
and
see
it
through
she
urged
this
is
our
chance
to
learn
the
and
perhaps
solve
the
mystery
of
atherwald
disappearance
all
right
the
reporter
agreed
but
i
wish
you
were
in
on
this
from
the
tiny
window
of
the
cabin
he
and
penny
observed
various
landmarks
as
the
boat
proceeded
downstream
perhaps
half
an
hour
elapsed
before
the
cruiser
came
to
the
mouth
of
a
narrow
river
which
emptied
into
the
kobalt
from
that
point
on
progress
became
slow
and
often
the
boat
was
so
close
to
shore
that
penny
could
have
reached
out
and
touched
overhanging
bushes
i
did
know
this
stream
was
deep
enough
for
a
motor
boat
jerry
whispered
we
must
be
heading
for
a
deep
in
the
swamp
i
hope
salt
has
sense
enough
to
call
dad
and
the
police
penny
said
with
the
first
show
of
nervousness
we
going
to
be
a
long
way
from
help
the
boat
crept
on
for
perhaps
a
mile
then
it
stopped
and
penny
assumed
they
had
reached
their
destination
gazing
out
of
the
window
again
she
saw
why
they
were
halted
a
great
tree
with
branches
had
fallen
across
the
river
blocking
the
way
look
jerry
she
whispered
we
not
be
able
to
go
any
farther
guess
again
the
reporter
muttered
penny
saw
then
that
one
of
the
men
had
left
the
boat
and
was
walking
along
shore
he
seemed
not
in
the
least
disturbed
by
the
great
tree
and
for
the
first
time
it
dawned
upon
her
that
it
served
a
definite
purpose
lift
up
gus
called
the
man
at
the
wheel
of
the
boat
his
companion
disappeared
into
the
bushes
several
minutes
elapsed
and
then
penny
heard
a
creaking
sound
as
if
ropes
were
moving
on
a
pulley
the
tree
whispered
jerry
his
eyes
flashing
it
lifting
very
slowly
an
inch
at
a
time
the
great
tree
raised
from
the
water
its
huge
roots
serving
as
a
hinge
when
it
was
high
enough
the
motor
boat
passed
beneath
the
dripping
branches
and
waited
on
the
other
side
slowly
the
tree
was
lowered
into
place
once
more
clever
mighty
clever
jerry
muttered
anyone
searching
for
the
would
never
think
of
looking
beyond
this
fallen
tree
to
all
purposes
nature
put
it
here
nature
probably
did
penny
added
but
our
dishonorable
friends
adapted
it
to
their
own
use
through
the
window
penny
saw
the
man
called
gus
reboard
the
boat
once
more
the
cruiser
went
on
up
the
narrow
stream
making
slow
but
steady
progress
long
shadows
had
settled
over
the
water
soon
it
became
dark
then
a
short
distance
ahead
jerry
and
penny
observed
a
light
as
the
boat
drifted
up
to
a
wharf
a
man
could
be
seen
standing
there
with
a
glowing
lantern
they
were
unable
to
see
his
face
and
quickly
dodged
back
from
the
cabin
window
to
avoid
being
noticed
everything
all
right
aaron
the
man
at
the
wheel
asked
jumping
ashore
he
looped
a
coil
of
rope
about
one
of
the
dock
posts
aaron
whispered
penny
gripping
jerry
hand
it
must
be
aaron
dietz
kippenberg
former
business
associate
so
the
ringleader
in
this
business
they
listened
trying
to
hear
the
man
reply
to
the
question
which
had
been
asked
yeah
everything
all
right
he
responded
gruffly
you
do
sound
any
too
cheerful
about
it
atherwald
still
wo
talk
keeps
insisting
he
does
know
where
the
gold
is
hidden
what
bothers
me
i
am
beginning
to
think
we
made
a
mistake
he
may
be
telling
the
truth
say
this
is
a
fine
time
to
be
finding
it
out
oh
keep
your
shirt
on
gus
you
and
jake
will
get
your
pay
anyhow
and
even
if
atherwald
does
know
the
hiding
place
we
make
kippenberg
come
through
you
have
to
find
him
first
the
other
retorted
if
you
ask
my
opinion
you
made
a
mess
of
the
whole
affair
no
one
asked
your
opinion
we
make
atherwald
tell
tonight
or
else
the
man
with
the
lantern
started
away
from
the
dock
but
paused
before
he
had
taken
many
steps
get
those
supplies
up
to
the
shack
he
ordered
then
i
want
to
talk
with
you
both
all
right
was
the
reply
but
we
have
to
get
the
cabin
door
open
first
flora
locked
it
and
lost
the
key
i
did
the
girl
protested
shrilly
do
you
try
to
blame
me
jerry
and
penny
knew
that
their
situation
now
was
a
precarious
one
if
they
were
found
in
the
cabin
they
would
be
taken
prisoners
and
the
exclusive
story
which
they
hoped
to
write
never
would
be
theirs
we
trapped
ourselves
in
this
the
reporter
muttered
all
my
doing
too
we
can
hide
in
the
closet
jerry
the
men
may
not
think
to
search
there
noiselessly
they
opened
the
door
and
slipped
into
the
tiny
room
the
air
was
hot
and
stuffy
the
space
too
narrow
for
comfort
jerry
and
penny
did
not
have
long
to
wait
before
there
came
a
loud
crash
against
the
cabin
door
the
two
seamen
were
trying
to
break
through
the
flimsy
panel
bring
a
light
flora
called
one
of
the
men
penny
and
jerry
flattened
themselves
against
the
closet
wall
waiting
a
panel
splintered
on
the
outside
cabin
door
and
a
heavy
tramping
of
feet
told
them
that
the
men
had
entered
the
room
no
one
in
here
gus
it
just
as
we
thought
flora
locked
the
door
and
lied
out
of
it
i
did
i
did
cried
the
girl
someone
else
must
have
done
it
while
i
was
at
the
store
the
door
was
unlocked
when
i
went
away
there
no
one
here
now
i
i
thought
i
heard
voices
while
we
were
coming
down
the
river
in
this
cabin
yes
just
a
low
murmur
you
imagined
it
the
man
told
her
but
i
take
a
look
in
the
closet
to
be
sure
he
walked
across
the
cabin
toward
the
hiding
place
penny
and
jerry
braced
themselves
for
the
moment
when
the
door
would
be
flung
open
they
had
trapped
themselves
and
now
faced
almost
certain
capture
chapter
the
before
the
man
could
pull
open
the
closet
door
a
booming
voice
called
impatiently
from
shore
say
are
you
coming
we
have
plenty
of
work
ahead
of
us
tonight
distracted
from
his
purpose
the
searcher
turned
aside
without
glancing
into
the
closet
with
his
companion
and
the
girl
he
left
the
cabin
penny
and
jerry
waited
at
least
five
minutes
when
all
was
silent
above
they
stole
from
their
hiding
place
from
the
window
they
assured
themselves
that
the
wharf
was
deserted
what
do
we
do
now
start
after
the
police
penny
questioned
let
make
certain
atherwald
is
here
first
we
ca
afford
to
be
wrong
a
path
led
through
the
timber
as
they
followed
it
jerry
and
penny
saw
a
moving
lantern
some
distance
ahead
they
kept
it
in
sight
until
the
three
men
and
flora
disappeared
into
a
cabin
stealing
on
through
the
darkness
penny
and
jerry
crept
to
the
screen
door
peering
in
they
saw
a
barren
room
containing
a
table
a
cook
stove
and
bunks
get
supper
on
flora
one
of
the
men
ordered
curtly
am
i
to
cook
anything
for
the
prisoner
she
asked
in
a
whining
voice
not
unless
he
decides
to
talk
i
find
out
if
he
changed
his
mind
the
man
who
had
been
called
aaron
crossed
the
cabin
to
an
adjoining
room
he
unlocked
the
door
which
had
been
fastened
with
a
padlock
and
went
inside
atherwald
must
be
in
there
whispered
penny
with
one
accord
she
and
jerry
tiptoed
across
the
sagging
porch
and
posted
themselves
under
a
high
window
glancing
up
they
saw
it
contained
no
glass
but
had
narrow
iron
bars
in
keeping
with
a
prison
chamber
jerry
lifted
penny
up
so
that
she
could
peep
into
the
room
by
the
light
of
the
oil
lantern
she
saw
a
haggard
young
man
sitting
on
the
bed
despite
a
stubble
of
beard
and
unkempt
hair
she
instantly
recognized
him
as
the
missing
bridegroom
she
made
another
observation
one
which
shocked
her
the
man
wrists
were
handcuffed
it
grant
atherwald
she
told
jerry
as
he
lowered
her
to
the
ground
they
treated
him
shamefully
jerry
held
up
his
hand
as
a
signal
for
silence
in
the
room
above
the
men
were
speaking
and
he
wished
to
hear
every
word
well
atherwald
have
you
changed
your
mind
how
about
a
little
supper
tonight
how
can
i
tell
you
something
i
do
know
the
bridegroom
retorted
wearily
kippenberg
never
confided
any
of
his
secrets
to
me
you
know
where
his
gold
is
hidden
i
do
think
he
ever
had
any
oh
yes
he
did
when
the
government
passed
a
law
that
it
was
illegal
to
keep
gold
kippenberg
decided
to
defy
it
he
had
over
half
his
fortune
converted
into
gold
which
he
expected
to
into
currency
at
a
great
profit
to
himself
his
plans
went
amiss
when
government
men
listed
him
for
investigation
you
seem
to
know
all
about
his
private
affairs
grant
atherwald
said
sarcastically
strange
that
you
have
learned
the
hiding
place
of
the
gold
if
there
ever
was
any
it
will
do
you
no
good
to
pretend
atherwald
either
you
tell
the
hiding
place
or
we
bring
your
bride
here
to
keep
you
company
you
would
dare
touch
her
you
fiend
no
well
unless
you
decide
to
talk
she
share
your
fate
and
i
promise
you
it
wo
be
a
pretty
one
now
i
leave
you
to
think
it
over
the
door
closed
with
a
bang
we
have
to
get
the
police
here
right
away
jerry
advised
penny
in
a
whisper
no
telling
what
those
scoundrels
may
try
to
do
to
atherwald
we
have
a
moment
to
waste
it
would
take
us
hours
to
bring
help
here
reasoned
penny
and
if
we
try
to
use
the
motorboat
the
gang
will
be
warned
and
flee
while
we
on
our
way
down
the
river
that
so
but
we
have
to
do
something
any
ideas
yes
i
have
one
penny
answered
soberly
it
may
sound
pretty
crazy
still
i
really
believe
it
would
work
hurriedly
she
outlined
what
she
had
in
mind
jerry
listened
incredulously
but
as
the
girl
explained
and
elaborated
certain
details
of
her
plan
his
doubts
began
to
clear
away
it
dangerous
he
protested
and
if
your
hunch
about
the
pool
is
wrong
we
will
be
in
a
fix
of
course
but
we
have
to
take
a
chance
in
order
to
save
atherwald
if
everything
went
exactly
according
to
plan
it
might
work
let
try
it
jerry
lift
me
up
so
i
can
attract
atherwald
attention
the
reporter
did
as
she
requested
penny
tapped
lightly
on
the
iron
bars
with
her
signet
ring
she
saw
grant
atherwald
start
and
turn
his
head
penny
repeated
the
signal
the
man
arose
from
the
bed
and
stumbled
toward
the
window
who
is
it
he
whispered
hoarsely
a
friend
can
you
get
me
out
of
here
we
going
to
try
you
are
handcuffed
yes
and
my
captor
keeps
the
key
in
his
pocket
the
room
outside
is
always
guarded
did
you
bring
an
implement
to
saw
through
the
bars
no
we
have
another
scheme
in
mind
but
you
must
do
exactly
as
we
tell
you
yes
yes
the
bridegroom
whispered
eagerly
his
pale
cheeks
flooding
with
color
listen
closely
penny
instructed
when
your
captor
comes
back
tell
him
you
have
decided
to
talk
i
know
nothing
about
the
cache
of
gold
the
man
protested
tell
your
captor
that
the
hiding
place
is
on
the
kippenberg
estate
that
would
only
involve
sylvia
and
kippenberg
i
do
nothing
to
get
them
into
trouble
you
have
to
obey
instructions
or
no
one
can
help
you
penny
said
severely
would
you
prefer
that
those
cruel
men
carry
out
their
threat
they
spirit
sylvia
away
and
try
to
force
the
truth
from
her
i
do
as
you
say
then
tell
your
captor
that
the
gold
is
hidden
in
a
specially
constructed
vault
lying
beneath
the
lily
pool
penny
had
resolved
to
act
upon
her
hunch
that
there
was
a
trapdoor
on
the
bottom
of
the
pool
now
as
she
issued
instructions
she
wished
that
she
might
have
found
some
way
of
examining
the
pool
to
see
if
she
were
right
however
she
had
to
take
a
chance
on
there
being
a
vault
beneath
the
pool
atherwald
protested
mildly
he
would
never
believe
such
a
fantastic
story
it
is
not
as
fantastic
as
it
sounds
replied
penny
you
must
convince
him
that
it
is
true
i
will
try
make
the
men
understand
that
to
get
the
gold
they
must
drain
the
pool
and
raise
a
trapdoor
in
the
cement
bottom
ask
to
be
taken
with
the
men
when
they
go
there
tonight
and
demand
that
you
be
given
your
freedom
as
soon
as
the
gold
is
found
they
will
never
let
me
go
alive
an
identification
from
me
would
send
them
all
to
prison
for
life
do
you
know
the
men
the
ringleader
is
aaron
dietz
at
one
time
he
was
employed
by
mr
kippenberg
just
as
i
thought
the
other
two
call
themselves
gus
and
jake
i
do
know
their
last
names
then
there
is
a
girl
who
seems
to
be
a
sister
to
gus
how
did
they
get
you
here
on
the
day
of
the
wedding
i
was
handed
a
note
just
as
i
reached
the
estate
it
requested
me
to
come
at
once
to
the
garden
while
i
waited
there
two
ruffians
sprang
upon
me
from
behind
before
i
could
cry
out
they
dragged
me
to
their
boat
at
the
river
edge
i
was
handcuffed
blindfolded
and
brought
to
this
cabin
the
slamming
of
an
outside
door
warned
penny
that
she
was
wasting
precious
time
in
talk
you
understand
your
instructions
she
whispered
hurriedly
yes
then
goodbye
with
luck
we
have
you
free
in
a
few
hours
with
luck
is
right
jerry
muttered
as
penny
slid
to
the
ground
aaron
dietz
stood
on
the
front
porch
staring
out
into
the
night
seeing
him
there
penny
and
jerry
circled
widely
before
attempting
to
return
to
the
river
satisfied
that
they
had
not
been
observed
they
boarded
the
boat
and
descended
to
the
cabin
for
possibly
an
hour
they
sat
in
the
dark
waiting
anxiously
looks
as
if
my
little
plan
did
work
penny
remarked
i
might
have
known
it
would
be
too
simple
jerry
had
risen
to
his
feet
he
went
to
the
window
and
listened
hear
anything
penny
whispered
hopefully
sounds
like
someone
coming
down
the
path
we
ought
to
get
into
our
they
tiptoed
to
the
closet
and
closed
the
door
within
a
few
minutes
they
heard
a
confusion
of
voices
and
the
shuffle
of
feet
as
men
boarded
the
cruiser
penny
wondered
if
the
group
included
grant
atherwald
and
was
greatly
relieved
when
she
heard
him
speak
i
do
see
why
you
think
i
would
you
he
said
distinctly
i
am
considering
my
own
welfare
you
promised
that
if
the
gold
is
found
you
give
me
my
freedom
sure
you
get
it
but
if
you
lying
about
the
hiding
place
the
words
were
drowned
out
by
the
roar
of
the
motor
boat
engine
penny
and
jerry
felt
the
floor
beneath
them
quiver
and
then
gently
roll
the
cruiser
was
under
way
we
heading
for
the
kippenberg
estate
penny
whispered
oh
everything
is
starting
out
beautifully
i
only
hope
it
ends
the
same
way
said
jerry
morosely
i
only
hope
it
does
chapter
of
the
lily
the
moon
rode
high
in
the
heavens
as
the
cabin
cruiser
let
go
its
anchor
in
a
cove
off
the
kippenberg
estate
penny
who
had
been
dozing
for
the
past
hour
in
her
prison
started
up
in
alarm
as
jerry
nudged
her
in
the
ribs
wake
up
he
whispered
we
here
at
the
estate
i
think
so
on
the
deck
above
their
heads
they
could
hear
the
men
talking
together
you
come
along
with
us
atherwald
aaron
dietz
said
flora
you
stay
here
and
guard
the
boat
if
you
see
anyone
watching
or
acting
suspiciously
blow
the
whistle
two
short
blasts
i
do
want
to
stay
here
alone
the
girl
whimpered
i
afraid
you
do
as
i
say
the
man
ordered
harshly
get
started
gus
two
now
we
wo
have
many
hours
before
daylight
in
making
her
plans
penny
had
not
once
considered
that
the
men
might
leave
a
guard
on
the
cruiser
with
the
girl
posted
as
a
lookout
they
were
still
prisoners
in
the
cabin
we
have
to
get
out
of
here
now
or
never
she
whispered
what
shall
we
do
about
flora
we
rush
her
and
take
a
chance
on
the
whistle
they
slipped
out
of
their
hiding
place
and
crawled
noiselessly
up
the
steep
stairway
pausing
there
they
watched
the
shadowy
figure
of
the
girl
in
the
bow
of
the
boat
she
was
quite
alone
for
her
companions
had
disappeared
into
the
woods
now
commanded
jerry
in
a
whisper
with
a
quick
rush
he
and
penny
were
across
the
deck
they
approached
flora
from
behind
and
were
upon
her
before
she
could
turn
her
head
jerry
grasped
her
arms
while
penny
clapped
a
hand
over
her
mouth
to
prevent
a
scream
although
the
girl
fought
fiercely
she
was
no
match
for
two
persons
stripping
off
her
sash
penny
gave
it
to
jerry
to
use
as
a
gag
they
bound
the
girl
wrists
and
ankles
then
carried
her
down
into
the
cabin
i
hate
to
leave
her
like
that
said
penny
as
they
went
back
on
deck
do
waste
your
sympathy
replied
jerry
she
does
deserve
it
anyway
we
soon
set
her
free
we
must
bring
the
police
now
the
nearest
house
with
a
telephone
is
about
a
half
mile
away
it
wo
take
us
long
to
cover
the
distance
jerry
said
helping
her
down
from
the
boat
you
go
alone
urged
penny
i
stay
here
and
keep
watch
i
do
like
to
leave
you
go
on
penny
gave
him
a
little
push
and
hurry
after
jerry
had
reluctantly
left
she
plunged
into
the
trees
carefully
picking
her
way
along
the
path
which
led
to
the
lily
pool
a
short
distance
brought
her
to
the
clearing
halting
she
saw
the
three
men
and
grant
atherwald
silhouetted
in
the
bright
moonlight
the
latter
was
still
handcuffed
guarded
by
aaron
dietz
who
allowed
his
companions
to
do
the
hard
labor
gus
and
jake
had
broken
open
the
door
of
the
stone
tower
the
soft
purr
of
a
motor
told
penny
that
they
had
started
draining
the
pool
she
wondered
what
the
men
would
do
when
they
discovered
that
the
tank
contained
a
very
live
alligator
it
ought
to
put
a
crimp
in
their
work
she
chuckled
kippenberg
could
have
chosen
a
more
effective
guard
for
his
gold
but
gradually
as
the
pool
drained
lower
and
lower
it
struck
penny
as
odd
that
the
men
did
not
notice
the
alligator
belatedly
it
occurred
to
her
that
the
kippenberg
gardener
had
probably
succeeded
in
getting
rid
of
the
monster
since
her
visit
to
the
garden
earlier
in
the
day
something
like
that
happen
she
thought
oh
well
even
so
jerry
ought
to
get
here
with
the
police
in
ample
time
only
the
waning
of
the
moon
gave
indication
of
how
swiftly
the
night
was
passing
penny
became
alarmed
as
she
observed
how
fast
the
pool
emptied
jerry
would
not
have
as
long
as
she
had
anticipated
but
surely
he
would
bring
help
before
it
was
too
late
presently
one
of
the
men
shut
off
the
motor
in
the
stone
tower
saying
with
quiet
jubilance
there
she
empty
he
jumped
down
into
the
tank
and
almost
at
once
uttered
a
cry
of
discovery
here
it
is
just
as
he
said
the
ring
to
the
trap
give
us
some
help
gus
with
aaron
dietz
and
the
bewildered
bridegroom
watching
from
above
the
two
men
raised
the
heavy
block
of
cement
penny
drew
closer
for
she
did
not
wish
to
miss
anything
she
stood
in
the
shadow
of
a
tree
scarcely
fifteen
yards
from
where
the
men
worked
a
stairway
leads
down
into
an
underground
vault
jake
cried
exultantly
we
found
the
hiding
place
of
the
gold
toss
me
your
flashlight
aaron
called
gus
we
soon
have
all
of
the
treasure
out
of
here
the
next
ten
minutes
brought
a
confused
whirl
of
impressions
thoughts
were
in
turmoil
why
did
jerry
come
with
the
police
as
soon
as
the
men
carried
the
burden
of
gold
to
the
boat
they
would
discover
flora
bound
and
gagged
then
they
would
suspect
that
a
trap
had
been
laid
oh
why
did
jerry
hurry
gus
and
jake
had
descended
into
the
underground
vault
as
the
light
reappeared
penny
was
dumbfounded
to
see
that
the
men
were
empty
handed
nothing
down
there
gus
reported
in
disgust
nothing
then
we
been
tricked
aaron
dietz
turned
furiously
upon
his
prisoner
you
pay
for
this
i
thought
the
gold
was
here
answered
grant
atherwald
lock
him
up
in
the
vault
and
start
the
water
running
advised
jake
harshly
it
a
good
way
to
be
rid
of
him
the
suggestion
appealed
to
aaron
dietz
at
a
nod
from
him
atherwald
was
seized
and
dragged
down
into
the
pool
he
was
shoved
into
the
vault
but
before
the
two
men
could
lower
the
heavy
cement
block
into
place
a
signal
from
dietz
arrested
their
action
wait
in
her
anxiety
over
grant
atherwald
penny
had
moved
closer
to
the
pool
without
realizing
that
she
was
exposing
herself
she
stood
so
that
her
shadow
fell
clearly
across
the
open
space
before
she
comprehended
her
danger
dietz
hurled
himself
upon
her
seizing
her
roughly
by
the
arms
penny
struggled
to
free
herself
but
could
not
the
man
grip
was
like
steel
so
you
were
spying
he
exclaimed
harshly
i
i
was
just
watching
penny
stammered
do
you
remember
me
i
am
the
girl
who
pulled
you
out
of
the
river
when
your
car
went
over
the
drawbridge
the
man
looked
closely
at
her
and
for
an
instant
she
dared
hope
that
he
would
recall
her
with
gratitude
but
his
face
hardened
again
and
he
said
unfeelingly
you
know
entirely
too
much
my
little
girl
this
is
one
story
you
will
never
write
for
your
father
paper
your
curiosity
has
proven
your
undoing
you
share
the
fate
of
your
very
good
friend
with
a
sinking
heart
penny
realized
by
the
man
words
that
he
knew
her
to
be
the
daughter
of
a
newspaper
publisher
and
that
he
had
guessed
her
part
in
the
trick
played
upon
him
down
you
go
dietz
said
harshly
as
he
dragged
her
toward
the
pool
penny
screamed
at
the
top
of
her
lungs
a
hand
was
clapped
over
her
mouth
she
bit
it
savagely
but
her
efforts
to
free
herself
were
of
no
avail
the
men
shoved
her
headlong
down
the
stone
stairway
into
the
pit
now
scream
as
much
as
you
like
aaron
dietz
hurled
after
her
no
one
will
hear
you
the
heavy
stone
slab
dropped
into
place
penny
picked
herself
up
from
the
steps
terror
gripped
her
and
with
a
sob
she
called
frantically
atherwald
mr
atherwald
here
at
the
bottom
of
the
steps
he
answered
with
a
groan
are
you
hurt
only
bruised
but
my
hands
are
still
in
cuffs
penny
limped
down
the
stairway
and
helped
the
man
to
his
feet
we
done
for
now
he
said
no
one
will
ever
look
for
us
down
in
this
vault
and
our
cries
will
never
be
heard
do
give
up
penny
murmured
encouragingly
we
may
be
able
to
lift
the
stone
come
let
try
mounting
the
stairs
they
applied
their
shoulders
to
the
massive
door
but
their
best
efforts
did
not
raise
it
an
inch
listen
cried
atherwald
suddenly
they
both
could
hear
the
sound
of
water
running
into
the
empty
pool
in
an
hour
time
no
one
will
ever
guess
that
a
hidden
vault
lies
beneath
the
tank
atherwald
groaned
we
doomed
if
we
can
hear
the
water
splashing
above
us
our
voices
might
carry
penny
reasoned
let
cry
out
for
help
now
together
they
shouted
over
and
over
until
their
voices
failed
them
then
completely
discouraged
they
sagged
down
on
the
stairway
to
rest
nothing
went
as
i
planned
penny
said
dismally
i
really
thought
the
gold
was
hidden
in
this
vault
if
the
men
had
found
it
they
would
have
spent
hours
removing
the
loot
to
their
boat
jerry
would
have
come
with
the
police
and
everything
would
have
been
all
right
grant
atherwald
was
not
listening
to
the
girl
words
he
struggled
to
his
feet
pressing
his
ear
against
the
trapdoor
the
water
has
stopped
running
are
you
sure
penny
sprang
up
and
stood
beside
him
listening
yes
and
i
hear
voices
with
one
accord
they
shouted
for
help
could
it
be
imagination
or
did
they
hear
an
answering
cry
as
they
repeated
their
frantic
call
there
was
a
scraping
on
the
stone
above
their
heads
stand
away
ordered
a
muffled
voice
before
penny
and
the
bridegroom
could
obey
the
great
door
lifted
a
deluge
of
water
poured
in
its
force
nearly
washing
them
from
the
steps
but
in
another
moment
the
passage
was
clear
and
they
stumbled
up
through
the
rectangular
opening
jerry
grasped
penny
hand
helping
her
out
of
the
vault
one
of
the
policemen
aided
atherwald
unfastening
the
handcuffs
which
held
him
a
prisoner
you
all
right
penny
the
reporter
asked
anxiously
i
i
feel
like
a
drowned
rat
she
laughed
shaking
water
out
of
her
hair
then
with
a
quick
change
of
mood
she
asked
did
you
get
aaron
dietz
and
his
men
no
jerry
answered
in
disgust
when
we
crossed
the
river
five
minutes
ago
the
cruiser
was
still
there
no
sign
of
anyone
around
i
brought
the
police
here
and
now
i
suppose
they
made
their
oh
jerry
we
ca
let
them
escape
send
the
police
now
do
get
worked
up
the
reporter
soothed
a
squad
started
back
just
as
soon
as
we
found
out
what
had
happened
here
dietz
and
his
men
must
have
seen
the
police
crossing
the
river
speculated
penny
they
may
have
hidden
in
the
bushes
biding
their
time
by
now
they
slipped
away
in
their
boat
i
afraid
of
it
jerry
admitted
i
traveled
as
fast
as
i
could
as
one
of
the
policemen
lifted
penny
out
of
the
pool
a
noise
which
sounded
like
the
of
an
automobile
broke
the
stillness
of
the
night
it
was
followed
by
a
volley
of
similar
sounds
gunfire
exclaimed
penny
the
policemen
started
at
a
run
through
the
woods
toward
the
place
where
the
white
cruiser
had
last
been
seen
penny
hesitated
and
then
took
the
opposite
direction
coming
out
of
the
woods
at
a
point
directly
opposite
the
drawbridge
gazing
far
up
the
river
she
could
see
the
white
cruiser
flashes
of
fire
coming
from
the
cabin
window
as
the
desperadoes
exchanged
shots
with
the
police
who
were
concealed
in
the
woods
that
boat
will
try
to
run
for
it
in
another
minute
penny
thought
if
only
the
drawbridge
were
down
kicking
off
her
shoes
she
dived
into
the
water
swimming
diagonally
across
the
river
to
take
advantage
of
the
swift
current
her
powerful
strokes
brought
her
to
shallow
water
and
she
waded
ashore
through
mud
as
she
scrambled
up
the
slippery
bank
her
wet
clothing
plastered
to
her
body
she
heard
the
roar
of
the
cruiser
motor
they
started
the
engine
she
thought
in
another
minute
the
boat
will
be
at
the
bridge
hurry
hurry
penny
could
force
herself
to
no
greater
effort
breathless
she
reached
the
gearhouse
and
groped
frantically
under
the
door
had
thorny
failed
to
hide
the
key
there
no
her
fingers
seized
upon
it
trembling
with
excitement
she
turned
it
in
the
lock
the
door
of
the
gearhouse
swung
open
now
could
she
remember
how
to
lower
the
bridge
any
mistake
would
be
costly
for
by
this
time
she
could
hear
the
cruiser
racing
down
the
river
at
full
speed
if
only
it
were
light
enough
so
that
she
could
see
the
gears
she
pulled
a
lever
and
her
heart
leaped
as
the
motor
responded
with
a
pleasant
purr
the
power
was
on
now
to
lower
the
bridge
thought
penny
but
which
lever
is
the
right
one
i
not
sure
with
a
prayer
in
her
heart
she
grasped
the
one
closest
at
hand
and
eased
it
forward
there
was
a
grinding
of
gears
as
the
tall
cantilevers
began
to
move
they
were
coming
down
but
oh
so
slowly
hurry
hurry
hurry
penny
whispered
as
if
her
words
could
speed
the
bridge
on
its
journey
the
white
cruiser
drove
onward
at
full
speed
lower
came
the
bridge
penny
held
her
breath
knowing
it
would
be
a
matter
of
inches
whether
or
not
the
boat
would
clear
the
man
at
the
wheel
aware
of
the
danger
did
not
swerve
from
his
course
the
bridge
settled
into
place
as
the
crash
came
penny
closed
her
eyes
did
it
i
stopped
them
she
thought
and
sagged
weakly
against
the
gear
house
chapter
for
minutes
later
penny
was
still
leaning
limply
against
the
building
when
a
car
drove
up
to
the
bridge
her
father
salt
and
a
bevy
of
policemen
and
government
representatives
sprang
out
and
ran
to
her
side
penny
what
happened
parker
clasped
his
daughter
in
his
arms
you
soaking
wet
did
we
hear
gunfire
as
we
turned
in
here
penny
waved
her
hand
weakly
toward
the
river
below
there
your
story
dad
pictures
galore
boat
smashes
into
dangerous
drawbridge
police
pursue
and
shoot
it
out
with
desperadoes
taking
what
left
of
into
custody
i
afraid
to
look
and
what
were
you
doing
while
all
this
was
going
on
demanded
her
father
me
i
was
just
waiting
for
the
drawbridge
to
go
down
parker
salt
and
the
policemen
he
had
brought
to
the
scene
rushed
to
the
edge
of
the
bridge
a
police
boat
had
drawn
up
beside
the
badly
listing
cruiser
and
three
men
prisoners
and
a
girl
were
being
taken
off
how
bad
is
it
penny
called
anxiously
all
captured
alive
answered
her
father
salt
get
that
camera
of
yours
into
action
where
jerry
he
would
be
missing
at
a
time
like
this
what
happened
anyhow
ca
someone
tell
me
penny
had
fully
recovered
the
power
of
speech
and
with
a
most
flattering
audience
she
recounted
her
adventures
excuse
me
just
a
minute
she
interrupted
herself
turning
her
back
she
pulled
a
sodden
photograph
from
the
front
of
her
dress
and
handed
it
to
her
father
this
picture
is
in
pretty
bad
shape
she
said
but
it
clue
number
one
you
see
it
a
photograph
of
miss
kippenberg
and
on
the
back
is
written
father
with
all
my
love
i
found
the
picture
this
afternoon
in
room
at
the
colonial
hotel
then
you
located
kippenberg
one
of
the
g
men
demanded
i
have
he
been
masquerading
as
the
kippenberg
gardener
coming
back
here
no
doubt
to
witness
the
marriage
of
his
daughter
we
arrest
him
right
away
said
the
government
man
turning
to
leave
thanks
for
the
tip
i
am
confident
miss
kippenberg
and
her
mother
had
nothing
to
do
with
grant
atherwald
disappearance
penny
went
on
aaron
dietz
plotted
the
whole
affair
himself
i
guess
he
must
have
learned
about
cache
of
gold
while
he
worked
for
the
man
he
believed
that
grant
atherwald
shared
the
secret
and
could
tell
where
the
money
was
hidden
you
located
the
gold
too
i
suppose
parker
remarked
whimsically
no
dad
i
slipped
up
there
i
thought
the
gold
was
in
a
secret
vault
under
the
alligator
pool
but
i
was
wrong
i
do
know
where
it
is
we
let
the
g
men
solve
that
mystery
when
they
take
kippenberg
into
custody
replied
her
father
our
work
is
cut
out
for
us
now
we
find
jerry
talk
with
young
atherwald
and
rout
miss
kippenberg
and
her
mother
out
of
bed
for
an
exclusive
interview
and
this
time
i
am
sure
they
answer
questions
declared
penny
during
the
next
hour
the
story
was
taken
entirely
from
her
hands
jerry
her
father
and
salt
knew
exactly
how
to
gather
every
fact
of
interest
to
the
readers
of
the
sylvia
kippenberg
overjoyed
to
find
her
fiancé
alive
posed
for
pictures
with
him
and
answered
all
questions
save
those
which
concerned
her
father
not
until
a
telephone
call
came
from
the
colonial
hotel
saying
that
kippenberg
had
been
taken
into
custody
would
either
sylvia
or
her
mother
admit
that
the
man
had
posed
as
the
gardener
very
well
it
is
true
kippenberg
acknowledged
at
last
james
has
been
trying
to
avoid
government
men
for
over
a
year
wishing
to
return
for
sylvia
wedding
he
disguised
himself
as
a
gardener
then
after
grant
disappearance
he
remained
here
trying
to
help
and
it
was
your
husband
who
managed
to
get
rid
of
the
alligator
penny
interposed
yes
we
were
afraid
police
might
ask
embarrassing
questions
james
disposed
of
it
to
a
zoo
late
yesterday
afternoon
and
the
cache
of
gold
under
the
lily
pool
said
parker
what
became
of
that
there
is
no
gold
none
at
all
none
and
there
never
was
any
questioned
penny
incredulously
then
why
was
the
vault
ever
built
tell
her
the
truth
mother
sylvia
urged
she
deserves
to
know
anyway
it
can
do
father
no
harm
now
at
one
time
my
husband
did
have
a
considerable
supply
of
gold
kippenberg
admitted
since
he
could
not
trust
a
bank
he
constructed
his
own
vault
under
the
pool
and
placed
the
alligator
there
as
a
precaution
against
prying
persons
my
father
really
did
nothing
so
very
wrong
sylvia
broke
in
the
gold
was
bought
with
his
own
money
if
he
chose
to
sell
it
later
at
a
profit
it
was
his
own
affair
not
in
the
opinion
of
the
government
parker
said
with
a
smile
he
held
the
gold
illegally
so
your
father
disposed
of
it
yes
he
shipped
it
out
of
the
country
months
ago
and
no
one
will
ever
be
able
to
prove
anything
against
him
my
husband
is
a
very
clever
man
added
kippenberg
proudly
that
remains
to
be
seen
said
parker
i
know
a
number
of
very
clever
government
men
too
later
in
dry
clothing
loaned
to
her
by
miss
kippenberg
penny
motored
back
to
corbin
with
her
father
jerry
and
salt
there
they
learned
that
the
three
prisoners
had
been
locked
up
in
jail
while
james
kippenberg
was
being
questioned
by
government
operatives
he
readily
admitted
that
he
had
disguised
himself
as
the
gardener
but
defied
anyone
to
prove
he
ever
had
disposed
of
illegal
gold
parker
did
not
wait
to
learn
the
outcome
of
the
interview
instead
he
telephoned
the
big
story
to
dewitt
and
arranged
for
complete
coverage
on
every
new
angle
of
the
case
satisfied
that
no
more
could
be
learned
that
night
the
party
sped
back
toward
riverview
aaron
dietz
and
his
confederates
ought
to
get
long
prison
sentences
penny
remarked
as
they
drove
through
the
night
but
what
will
happen
to
kippenberg
dad
do
you
think
he
will
escape
punishment
as
his
wife
believes
he
get
what
is
coming
to
him
replied
parker
a
government
man
told
me
tonight
that
kippenberg
income
tax
reports
have
been
falsified
and
kippenberg
knew
they
had
evidence
against
him
or
he
never
would
have
gone
into
hiding
no
even
if
it
ca
be
proven
that
he
held
gold
illegally
he
certainly
be
fined
and
given
a
year
or
so
in
prison
for
tax
evasion
i
hope
he
receives
a
light
sentence
for
sylvia
sake
said
penny
after
a
moment
she
added
sylvia
and
grant
atherwald
are
going
to
be
married
tomorrow
they
told
me
so
there
a
fact
we
missed
declared
jerry
penny
always
is
showing
us
up
oh
i
did
prove
myself
so
brilliant
tonight
responded
penny
when
i
was
down
in
that
vault
i
decided
i
was
just
plain
dumb
if
you
had
sense
enough
to
guess
where
grant
atherwald
and
i
were
being
held
well
dad
would
have
had
to
adopt
a
new
daughter
it
was
easy
enough
to
tell
what
had
happened
said
jerry
you
had
told
me
you
thought
there
was
a
secret
vault
beneath
the
pool
then
too
i
found
your
handkerchief
floating
in
the
bottom
the
water
had
only
been
running
in
a
few
minutes
he
fished
in
his
pocket
and
brought
out
a
pin
which
he
handed
to
penny
i
also
found
this
thanks
jerry
said
penny
that
louise
cameo
pin
she
dropped
it
the
day
we
were
on
the
kippenberg
estate
together
the
police
gave
you
full
credit
for
the
capture
of
those
men
penny
said
her
father
with
pride
you
yanked
the
drawbridge
just
in
time
to
trap
them
salt
did
his
share
too
mentioned
penny
generously
he
went
for
the
police
just
as
soon
as
he
realized
jerry
and
i
had
been
carried
away
on
the
cruiser
the
only
trouble
was
that
the
cops
wasted
too
much
time
searching
for
you
down
river
the
photographer
drawled
we
finally
went
back
to
corbin
and
ran
into
parker
who
suggested
we
come
to
the
estate
how
did
you
happen
to
be
in
corbin
dad
asked
penny
curiously
you
might
know
i
was
looking
for
you
is
that
my
usual
occupation
you
not
provoked
at
me
dad
no
of
course
not
the
publisher
answered
warmly
you
all
done
fine
work
tonight
this
is
the
biggest
story
we
run
into
in
over
a
year
we
score
a
beat
on
the
rival
papers
then
do
you
think
jerry
and
salt
have
earned
a
raise
suggested
penny
yes
agreed
her
father
absently
i
take
care
of
it
tomorrow
and
you
might
tack
on
another
dollar
to
my
allowance
dad
i
also
have
a
small
bill
to
present
there
will
be
several
dollars
for
gasoline
lunches
going
and
coming
from
corbin
two
ruined
dresses
a
pair
of
torn
silk
stockings
and
that
enough
broke
in
parker
with
a
laugh
if
you
keep
on
listing
your
expenses
i
be
broke
you
turned
out
to
be
an
expensive
reporter
it
was
worth
it
was
it
penny
demanded
placing
her
hands
on
her
hips
her
father
agreed
heartily
it
certainly
was
penny
the
obtained
a
smashing
story
to
scoop
all
the
other
newspapers
and
i
got
my
elusive
daughter
back
again
safe
and
sound
penny
moved
closer
to
her
father
she
grasped
the
lapels
of
his
coat
in
her
slender
fingers
and
tipped
her
weary
but
still
lovely
face
toward
him
dad
will
you
promise
me
one
thing
that
depends
on
what
you
are
after
parker
told
her
gravely
whenever
the
has
a
baffling
mystery
to
be
run
down
to
earth
will
you
promise
to
call
in
your
ace
sleuth
and
who
would
that
be
demanded
parker
with
a
puzzled
frown
then
as
penny
laughed
gaily
he
also
started
to
grin
so
you
are
the
ace
sleuth
i
guess
i
was
a
little
slow
in
understanding
but
you
seem
to
be
right
this
is
the
third
mystery
you
solved
maybe
we
will
use
you
on
the
next
mystery
thanks
dad
said
penny
i
just
hope
i
wo
have
to
wait
too
long
for
the
next
mystery
to
come
along
the
end
transcriber
notes
replaced
the
list
of
books
in
the
series
by
the
complete
list
as
in
the
final
book
the
cry
at
midnight
silently
corrected
a
handful
of
palpable
typos
conforming
to
later
volumes
standardized
on
dewitt
as
the
name
of
the
city
editor
