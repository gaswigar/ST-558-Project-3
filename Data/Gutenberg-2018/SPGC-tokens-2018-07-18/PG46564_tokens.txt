the

is
an
epitome
of
the
best
in
history
philosophy
and
literature
the
great
writers
of
past
ages
are
accessible
to
readers
in
general
solely
through
translations
it
was
therefore
necessary
that
translations
of
such
rare
classics
as
are
embodied
in
this
series
should
be
of
the
best
and
should
possess
exactitude
in
text
and
supreme
faithfulness
in
rendering
the
author
thought
under
the
vigilant
scholarship
of
the
editorial

this
has
been
accomplished
with
unvarying
excellence
the
classification
selection
and
editing
of
the
various
volumes
have
been
the
subject
of
much
earnest
thought
and
consultation
on
the
part
of
more
than
twenty
of
the
best
known
scholars
of
the

the
universities
of

including
the

of
five
of

who

special

upon

may
be
mentioned
the

the
celebrated

the
scholarly

late

of
state
david
hill
lent
his
wide
reading
to
the
brilliant
and
luminous
essay
that
precedes
the
rights
of
war
and
peace
the
resources
of
the
congressional
library
at
washington
as
well
as
of
foreign
libraries
have
all
been
drawn
upon
in
the
gigantic
task
of
compressing
into
the
somewhat
narrow
limits
of
twenty
volumes
all
that
was
highest
best
most
enduring
and
useful
in
the
various
ramifications
of
literature
at
large
the
first
section
of
the
library
is
devoted
entirely
to
the
manuscript
reproductions
of
the
autographs
of
celebrated
men
in
all
ranks
and
phases
of
life
covering
a
period
of
three
centuries
they
are
in
fact
the
american
edition
of
the
reproduction
of
rare
and
celebrated
autographs
drawn
from
the
british
museum
that
was
issued
in
england
under
the
editorship
of
the
assistant
keeper
of
the
manuscripts
they
afford
an
opportunity
to
the
inquiring
reader
to
study
the
characters
of
rulers
statesmen
writers
and
artists
through
the
medium
of
their
chirography
it
has
long
been
recognized
that
character
is
traceable
through
handwriting
so
it
is
interesting
to
discern
in
the
characters
traced
by
henry
viii
the
hardened
sensual
and
selfish
character
of
that
autocrat
and
polygamist
in
the
writing
of
thomas
wolsey
those
crafty
traits
combined
with
perseverance
and
mock
humility
which
raised
him
wellnigh
to
supremacy
in
the
realm
and
led
him
finally
to
a
downfall
more
complete
than
any
we
read
of
in
english
history
and
in
that
of
charles
v
of
spain
the
continence
of
character
and
superb
common
sense
which
enabled
him
at
the
height
of
glory
to
retire
to
a
monastery
while
yet
there
was
daylight
in
life
as
he
expressed
it
for
the
making
of
his
soul
apart
from
the
historical
interest
of
these
documents
this
study
of
character
as
revealed
in
them
will
prove
fascinating
to
thinking
minds
the
magna
carta
greatest
of
all
historical
charters
wrung
from
the
various
kings
of
england
from
henry
i
downward
was
granted
by
king
john
at
the
pressing
instance
of
the
barons
and
commons
of
england
toward
the
end
of
his
and
unfortunate
reign
of
this
document
celebrated
and
historic
as
it
is
but
little
is
known
at
large
although
blackstone
and
other
prominent
lawyers
have
written
upon
it
information
about
it
is
hard
to
obtain
no
reproduction
of
the
original
document
has
ever
been
offered
to
american
collectors
this
facsimile
is
illuminated
in
colors
with
the
shields
of
many
of
the
peers
who
compelled
king
john
to
accede
to
their
demands
for
civil
and
religious
liberty
the
original
charter
was
signed
at
a
place
called
runnymede
the
council
meadow
a
spot
between
windsor
and
staines
on
the
of
june
about
a
year
before
the
death
of
john
it
practically
guaranteed
to
the
commons
of
england
all
the
civil
and
religious
rights
they
enjoy
it
dealt
with
testamentary
law
as
well
securing
to
widows
all
the
legal
rights
which
they
possess
it
dealt
with
the
rights
of
accused
persons
with
military
service
with
feudal
tenure
with
taxation
and
it
limited
the
heretofore
autocratic
power
of
the
king
to
an
extent
unknown
before
in
the
history
of
the
world
if
we
except
the
declaration
of
independence
it
is
the
most
interesting
historical
record
of
all
time
the
second
section
of
the
library
ten
volumes
is
devoted
to
the
presentation
of
government
philosophy
law
and
ethics
this
section
embraces
such
names
as
grotius
plato
sir
george
cornewall
lewis
adam
smith
hamilton
madison
jay
walter
bagehot
spinoza
schopenhauer
machiavelli
as
well
as
those
builders
of
ideal
governments
more
bacon
campanella
and
rousseau
of
all
benefactors
in
literature
of
the
human
race
grotius
may
perhaps
rank
as
first
among
his
equals
centuries
have
borne
witness
to
the
justness
of
his
premises
and
the
wisdom
of
his
conclusions
the
principles
of
national
law
laid
down
by
him
are
accepted
as
the
axioms
of
the
science
among
the
nations
perhaps
the
united
states
is
most
deeply
interested
in
the
right
administration
of
the
principles
affirmed
by
grotius
in
his
gigantic
work
on
the
rights
of
war
and
peace
and
it
was
therefore
most
fitting
when
the
recent
peace
conference
at
the
hague
completed
the
great
structure
of
international
comity
the
foundations
of
which
were
laid
by
grotius
in
that
a
silver
wreath
was
laid
by
the
representative
of
the
united
states
upon
the
grave
of
the
man
to
whom
the
conference
owed
its
initial
impulse
although
at
a
distance
in
time
of
nearly
three
centuries
when
the
publisher
determined
under
the
advice
of
his
editorial
council
to
publish
grotius
he
found
that
only
two
volumes
of
the
first
edition
were
available
in
the
library
of
congress
at
much
expense
and
trouble
he
instituted
a
search
in
europe
and
finally
obtained
the
missing
volume
which
he
presented
to
the
congressional
library
where
it
now
is
sir
george
cornewall
lewis
government
of
dependencies
is
characterized
by
the
accuracy
of
its
information
it
is
a
reliable
text
book
for
the
guidance
of
any
nation
in
the
treatment
of
its
dependencies
and
colonies
it
is
a
classic
that
will
survive
as
long
as
colonization
remains
to
be
done
and
it
is
remarkable
that
although
it
was
published
for
the
first
time
sixty
years
ago
the
illustrations
afforded
by
the
last
two
generations
support
the
justice
of
its
principles
and
the
exactness
of
its
deductions
adam
smith
essay
on
colonies
presents
an
introductory
view
of
the
principles
governing
colonial
policy
it
is
a
fitting
work
to
go
hand
in
hand
with
the
greater
one
of
sir
george
cornewall
lewis
it
is
of
practical
use
to
american
statesmen
since
the
united
states
seems
at
present
to
be
entering
upon
a
colonial
policy
its
practical
wisdom
which
has
made
it
a
classic
for
all
times
finds
a
special
applicability
in
the
conditions
of
for
adam
smith
was
a
theorist
in
the
best
sense
of
the
word
that
is
to
say
he
was
a
man
whose
breadth
of
view
instead
of
unfitting
him
for
practical
details
enabled
him
to
deduce
from
the
lessons
of
history
and
experience
the
right
solutions
for
the
problems
of
colonial
policy
plato
republic
and
statesman
must
be
regarded
not
merely
as
historical
records
of
a
philosophy
but
as
living
teaching
dissertations
upon
theories
which
can
not
fail
to
awaken
in
studious
minds
the
highest
ideals
of
life
and
government
modern
problems
stated
in
the
light
of
plato
philosophy
as
it
is
expressed
in
these
books
will
find
readier
solutions
when
examined
in
the
light
of
its
principles
no
student
of
sociology
of
politics
national
and
municipal
or
of
government
in
all
its
aspects
can
afford
to
be
without
a
knowledge
of
these
immortal
discourses
goldwin
smith
has
declared
that
of
all
expositions
of
constitutional
government
the
federalist
ranks
the
highest
when
hamilton
madison
and
jay
first
conceived
the
idea
of
printing
in
the
common
tongue
their
ideas
upon
the
principles
of
free
government
they
unwittingly
laid
the
foundations
of
the
best
commentary
on
the
principles
of
popular
government
ever
written
political
science
owes
to
them
the
most
important
contribution
to
its
literature
made
since
its
birth
the
essays
are
equally
admirable
for
sagacity
simplicity
and
patriotism
and
while
the
federalist
will
never
be
read
for
pleasure
it
contains
a
mine
of
wisdom
for
the
student
and
the
constitutional
lawyer
and
as
a
text
book
of
political
science
is
without
a
parallel
when
bagehot
issued
his
work
on
the
english
constitution
it
was
hailed
by
the
critics
as
the
most
wonderful
and
philosophical
dissertation
on
the
subject
in
any
language
or
from
any
pen
john
stuart
mill
used
to
say
that
of
all
great
subjects
much
remained
to
be
written
and
that
especially
was
this
true
of
the
english
constitution
bagehot
work
although
affording
the
conclusion
that
monarchy
in
england
exists
as
a
logical
necessity
is
so
unbiased
in
its
premises
so
logical
and
clear
in
its
deductions
that
this
manifest
fairness
although
leading
one
to
conclusions
distasteful
to
a
republican
mind
must
endear
him
to
his
readers
dealing
with
a
subject
somewhat
dry
in
its
details
he
invests
inanimate
objects
with
so
much
light
that
they
become
realities
in
the
highest
sense
he
combines
popularity
and
scholarship
spinoza
philosophy
may
be
traced
both
to
the
influence
of
bacon
his
predecessor
and
to
descartes
his
contemporary
its
combination
of
positivism
with
the
enthusiasm
of
piety
characterizes
his
philosophy
as
unique
in
itself
for
while
treating
man
from
a
purely
mechanical
standpoint
it
asserts
that
the
mechanism
itself
is
entirely
divine
spinoza
was
a
voluntary
martyr
in
the
cause
of
free
thought
he
was
at
the
same
time
both
pantheist
and
monist
yet
sincere
in
his
devotion
to
nature
and
the
god
of
nature
his
religion
naturally
made
him
a
monist
while
his
philosophy
led
him
to
express
the
pantheism
that
the
lover
of
god
in
nature
can
not
avoid
while
he
renounced
his
judaism
and
entered
the
ranks
of
the
christian
philosophers
he
never
received
baptism
he
may
be
ranked
among
the
greatest
of
the
german
mystics
whose
work
had
such
profound
influence
upon
the
dogmatic
christianity
of
a
later
day
the
epithet
conferred
on
him
namely
summarizes
his
whole
attitude
and
the
character
of
his
philosophy
better
than
any
lengthy
dissertation
when
schopenhauer
began
to
write
he
declared
himself
a
true
disciple
of
kant
but
he
modifies
and
adapts
kant
critique
of
pure
reason
to
such
an
extent
that
he
reaches
the
attitude
of
opposition
this
attitude
he
manifests
throughout
all
his
writings
he
is
truly
an
apostle
of
protest
but
in
spite
of
his
positivist
contradictions
and
his
materialistic
pantheism
he
opens
up
a
mine
of
suggestions
to
the
literary
and
philosophical
student
in
spite
of
the
apparent
tragedy
due
to
the
conflict
within
him
we
can
not
help
gathering
from
schopenhauer
an
immensity
of
what
is
true
what
is
good
and
what
is
excellent
one
thing
especially
noticeable
about
his
writings
is
that
while
german
philosophers
are
often
ponderous
and
in
fact
nebulous
schopenhauer
is
always
clear
original
and
readable
to
machiavelli
belongs
by
acclaim
the
honor
of
having
written
the
ideal
biography
of
a
state
his
clear
straightforward
concise
statement
of
conditions
and
characters
as
he
saw
then
is
a
model
for
all
writers
of
record
he
was
the
first
great
italian
historian
and
no
man
has
ever
been
more
ardent
in
his
patriotism
or
a
more
earnest
supporter
of
government
for
and
by
the
people
the
greatest
tribute
to
his
inflexible
honesty
of
character
is
the
fact
that
while
no
man
had
greater
opportunities
to
enrich
himself
at
the
cost
of
the
state
he
died
leaving
his
family
in
the
greatest
poverty
his
varied
political
experience
and
his
assiduous
study
of
classic
writers
gave
him
the
ability
as
well
as
the
desire
to
write
the
history
of
his
native
state
time
has
pronounced
this
history
to
be
a
classic
worthy
of
preservation
and
the
perspective
of
time
has
also
enabled
us
to
form
a
juster
and
greater
estimate
of
its
author
the
ideal
republics
and
empires
that
have
been
constructed
from
time
to
time
by
political
dreamers
have
all
the
attractiveness
of
works
like
pilgrim
progress
or
gulliver
travels
combined
with
a
philosophy
and
political
insight
that
give
them
a
double
claim
to
be
considered
classics
modern
progress
may
be
more
deeply
indebted
than
we
can
estimate
to
the
fantasies
and
airy
castles
of
men
like
rousseau
more
and
campanella
the
four
ideal
republics
or
governments
described
in
this
volume
are
perhaps
the
most
famous
of
all
since
they
rank
not
only
as
great
creations
of
the
imagination
but
as
literature
of
the
highest
class
and
their
writers
have
a
further
claim
upon
posterity
from
the
fact
that
they
helped
to
make
history
the
third
and
concluding
section
of
the
library
deals
with
that
tremendous
range
of
literature
which
we
call
for
want
of
a
better
name
belles
lettres
goethe
contributes
his
brilliant
and
sagacious
observations
on
men
and
things
as
he
communicated
them
to
eckerman
landor
of
whom
swinburne
has
said
that
milton
alone
stands
higher
both
in
prose
and
verse
furnishes
us
with
his
classical
conversations
montesquieu
and
goldsmith
are
drawn
on
for
their
persian
and
chinese
letters
lord
chesterfield
gives
us
the
irony
and
criticism
combined
with
worldly
common
sense
contained
in
the
letters
to
his
son
and
the
various
names
best
known
in
french
and
english
belles
lettres
yield
what
is
greatest
in
them
ottoman
literature
comprising
arabian
persian
and
hebraic
poems
affords
the
reader
an
insight
into
the
romantic
and
dramatic
character
of
the
oriental
the
dabistan
possibly
the
most
extraordinary
book
ever
written
in
the
east
finds
itself
at
home
in
this
section
while
the
literature
of
the
hebrews
is
ideally
represented
in
that
most
wonderful
of
all
monuments
of
human
wisdom
and
perhaps
folly
the
talmud
together
with
the
basis
of
modern
metaphysics
the
kabbala
the
sufistic
quatrains
of
omar
khayyam
are
here
for
the
first
time
presented

in
a

nicolas
french
transcription
of

it
is
safe
to
say
that
any
lover
of
omar
wishing
to
add
to
his
collection
the
versions
here
quoted
would
be
compelled
to
disburse
more
than
one
hundred
times
the
amount
this

will
cost
him
while
the
library
of
universal
classics
does
not
claim
to
be
the
final
condensation
of
the
treasure
houses
of
human
philosophy
and
lore
whether
practical
or
ideal
it
does
most
emphatically
assert
its
right

conclusion
index
introduction
the
work
and
influence
of
hugo
grotius
the
claims
of
the
great
work
of
grotius
jure
belli
ac
to
be
included
in
a
list
of
universal
classics
do
not
rest
upon
the
felicity
of
style
usually
expected
in
a
classic
composition
his
work
is
marked
by
frequent
rhetorical
deformities
tedious
and
involved
forms
of
reasoning
and
perplexing
obscurities
of
phraseology
which
prevent
its
acceptance
as
an
example
of
elegant
writing
notwithstanding
these
external
defects
it
is
nevertheless
one
of
the
few
notable
works
of
genius
which
among
the
labors
of
centuries
stand
forth
as
illustrations
of
human
progress
and
constitute
the
precious
heritage
of
the
human
race
if
it
is
not
literature
in
the
technical
sense
the
masterpiece
of
grotius
is
something
higher
and
nobler
a
triumph
of
intelligence
over
irrational
impulses
and
barbarous
propensities
its
publication
marks
an
era
in
the
history
of
nations
for
out
of
the
chaos
of
lawless
and
unreasoning
strife
it
created
a
system
of
illuminating
principles
to
light
the
way
of
sovereigns
and
peoples
in
the
paths
of
peace
and
general
concord
i
the
reign
of
war
the
idea
of
peaceful
equity
among
nations
now
accepted
as
a
human
ideal
though
still
far
from
realization
was
for
ages
a
difficult
if
not
an
impossible
conception
all
experience
spoke
against
it
for
war
was
the
most
familiar
phenomenon
of
history
among
the
greek
a
few
temporary
leagues
and
federations
were
attempted
but
so
feeble
were
the
bonds
of
peace
so
explosive
were
the
passions
which
led
to
war
that
even
among
the
highly
civilized
hellenic
peoples
community
of
race
language
and
religion
was
powerless
to
create
a
greek
nation
it
was
reserved
for
the
military
genius
of
alexander
the
great
at
last
by
irresistible
conquest
to
bring
the
greek
empire
into
being
to
be
destroyed
in
turn
by
superior
force
the
roman
empire
almost
achieved
the
complete
political
unity
of
europe
and
bound
parts
of
three
continents
under
one
rule
but
the
corruption
of
the
military
power
which
held
it
together
led
to
its
inevitable
dismemberment
after
the
conflicts
of
the
barbaric
kingdoms
which
followed
the
dissolution
of
the
western
empire
were
ended
by
the
predominance
of
the
frankish
monarchy
the
world
believed
that
the
was
to
be
restored
in
europe
by
the
hand
of
charles
the
great
but
the
disruptive
forces
were
destined
to
prevail
once
more
and
the
holy
roman
empire
never
succeeded
in
reviving
the
power
of
ancient
rome
and
thus
the
dream
of
a
universal
monarchy
of
a
central
authority
able
to
preside
over
kings
and
princes
adjusting
their
difficulties
and
preserving
the
peace
between
them
was
at
last
proved
futile
in
each
of
the
great
national
monarchies
that
had
already
risen
or
were
still
rising
on
the
ruins
of
imperial
dominion
particularly
in
france
england
holland
and
the
states
of
germany
a
continuous
internal
conflict
over
questions
of
religion
complicated
the
bitterness
and
destructiveness
of
foreign
wars
until
europe
was
reorganized
by
the
peace
of
westphalia
in
it
was
in
the
midst
of
these
wars
that
grotius
was
born
he
saw
his
own
country
rising
from
a
baptism
of
blood
and
all
europe
rent
and
torn
by
the
awful
struggle
of
the
thirty
years
war
in
the
midst
of
which
his
great
work
was
written
and
to
whose
conclusion
it
served
as
a
guide
and
inspiration
the
empire
dismembered
had
been
reduced
to
almost
complete
impotence
the
church
had
been
disrupted
and
no
international
authority
was
anywhere
visible
amid
the
general
wreck
of
institutions
grotius
sought
for
light
and
guidance
in
great
principles
looking
about
him
at
the
general
havoc
which
war
had
made
the
nations
hostile
the
faith
of
ages
shattered
the
passions
of
men
destroying
the
commonwealths
which
nourished
them
he
saw
that
europe
possessed
but
one
common
bond
one
vestige
of
its
former
unity
human
to
this
he
made
appeal
and
upon
its
deepest
convictions
he
sought
to
plant
the
law
of
nations
ii
the
predecessors
of
grotius
it
is
historically
accurate
to
say
that
until
formulated
by
grotius
europe
possessed
no
system
of
international
law
others
had
preceded
him
in
touching
upon
certain
aspects
of
the
rights
and
duties
of
nations
but
none
had
produced
a
system
comparable
to
his
the
earliest
attempt
to
formulate
recognized
international
customs
was
the
formation
of
the
early
maritime
codes
rendered
necessary
by
the
expansion
of
mediæval
commerce
from
the
end
of
the
eleventh
to
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
century
such
as
the
d
adopted
by
the
merchants
of
france
england
and
spain
and
reissued
under
other
names
for
the
merchants
of
the
netherlands
and
the
baltic
consolato
del
a
more
elaborate
compilation
was
made
apparently
at
barcelona
about
the
middle
of
the
fourteenth
century
and
accepted
generally
by
the
traders
of
the
chief
maritime
powers
it
was
in
the
cradle
of
commerce
therefore
that
international
law
awoke
to
consciousness
as
the
church
was
often
intrusted
with
the
task
of
pacification
it
is
but
natural
to
look
among
her
representatives
for
the
earliest
writers
on
the
laws
of
international
relations
it
is
in
fact
among
the
theological
moralists
that
we
find
the
first
students
of
this
subject
as
early
as
a
spanish
theologian
vasquez
conceived
of
a
group
of
free
states
with
reciprocal
rights
regulated
by
naturale
et
without
regard
to
a
either
imperial
or
ecclesiastical
in
saurez
pointed
out
that
a
kind
of
customary
law
had
arisen
from
the
usages
of
nations
and
distinctly
described
a
society
of
interdependent
states
bound
by
fundamental
principles
of
justice
at
the
close
of
the
fifteenth
and
the
beginning
of
the
sixteenth
centuries
a
series
of
circumstances
arose
necessitating
the
extension
of
jurisprudence
beyond
its
ancient
boundaries
and
thus
tending
to
produce
a
group
of
international
jurists
among
the
juristic
writers
of
this
time
are
balthazar
ayala
a
spanish
jurisconsult
who
died
in

written
in
a
spirit
on
the
subject
of

when
in
at
the
age
of
seventeen
he
was
admitted
to
the
bar
the
youthful
prodigy

already
accompanied
the
grand
pensionary
john

oldenbarneveld
on
a
special
embassy
to
france
where
he
was
presented
to
henry

bestowed
upon

his
portrait

with

graciously
called

set
his
hand
to

work
entitled

he
defended
the
freedom
of

and
the
maritime
rights
of
his
country

arrogant
pretensions
of

portuguese
in
suppressing

turning
his

he
devoted
himself
for
a
time
to

annals
of
the
war
of
independence
in
grotius
added
to
his
laurels
as
poet
jurist
and
historian
by
entering
the
field
of
politics
and
he
was
appointed
pensionary
of
rotterdam
upon
the
condition
that
he
should
continue
in
office
during
his
own
pleasure
it
was
during
a
visit
to
england
upon
a
diplomatic
mission
in
this
same
year
that
he
met
the
great
scholar
isaac
casaubon
who
said
in
a
letter
to
daniel
heinsius
i
can
not
say
how
happy
i
esteem
myself
in
having
seen
so
much
of
one
so
truly
great
as
grotius
a
wonderful
man
this
i
knew
him
to
be
before
i
had
seen
him
but
the
rare
excellence
of
that
divine
genius
no
one
can
sufficiently
feel
who
does
not
see
his
face
and
hear
him
speak
probity
is
stamped
on
all
his
features
closely
related
by
personal
friendship
as
well
as
by
his
official
duties
to
the
grand
pensionary
john
of
oldenbarneveld
grotius
was
destined
to
share
with
that
unfortunate
patriot
the
proscription
and
punishment
which
maurice
of
orange
visited
upon
the
two
confederates
in
the
defense
of
religious
tolerance
risking
all
as
the
apostles
of
peace
they
were
soon
condemned
to
be
its
martyrs
oldenbarneveld
having
incurred
the
bitter
hatred
of
the
stadtholder
was
condemned
to
death
by
decapitation
on
may
grotius
less
offensive
to
maurice
on
account
of
his
youth
and
his
gracious
personality
was
sentenced
six
days
later
to
perpetual
imprisonment
on
the
of
june
he
was
incarcerated
in
the
fortress
of
loevestein
rigorously
treated
at
first
his
docility
and
resignation
soon
won
the
respect
and
affection
of
his
keepers
writing
materials
and
books
were
in
time
accorded
him
and
finally
on
condition
that
she
would
continue
to
share
his
captivity
he
was
granted
the
presence
of
his
wife
the
studious
prisoner
and
his
devoted
companion
completely
disarmed
all
suspicion
of
an
intention
to
escape
and
the
ponderous
chest
in
which
books
came
and
went
continued
to
bring
periodic
consolation
to
the
mind
of
the
busy
scholar
a
treatise
on
the
truth
of
the
christian
religion
a
catechism
for
the
use
of
his
children
a
digest
of
dutch
law
and
other
compositions
served
to
occupy
and
alleviate
the
weary
months
of
confinement
until
one
day
when
the
time
seemed
opportune
madame
grotius
secretly
inclosed
her
husband
in
the
great
chest
and
it
was
borne
away
by
two
soldiers
descending
the
stone
steps
of
the
prison
the
bearers
remarked
that
the
trunk
was
heavy
enough
to
contain
an
arminian
but
madame
grotius
jest
on
the
heaviness
of
arminian
books
smoothed
over
the
suspicion
if
one
was
really
entertained
and
the
great
jurist
was
sent
in
the
chest
safe
to
gorcum
attended
by
a
faithful
domestic
where
in
the
house
of
a
friend
the
prisoner
emerged
without
injury
and
in
the
guise
of
a
stone
mason
hastened
to
antwerp
from
antwerp
he
took
refuge
in
france
where
he
arrived
in
april
and
was
joined
by
his
faithful
wife
at
paris
in
the
following
october
the
bitterness
of
exile
was
now
to
be
added
to
the
miseries
of
imprisonment
for
grotius
was
not
only
excluded
from
the

had
graciously
accorded
him

tardily
paid
grotius
commenced
his
great
work

ac
in
the
summer
of
much
speculation
has
been
indulged
in
regarding
the
causes
which
led
to
the
composition
of
this
masterpiece
but
a
recent
discovery
has
rendered
all
this
superfluous
as
well
as
the
ascription
of
special
merit
to
the
counselor
peyresc
for
suggesting
the
idea
of
the
work
it
is
indeed
to
the
pacific
genius
of
grotius
more
than
to
all
other
causes
that
the
world
owes
the
origin
of
his
great
work
for
it
sprang
from
his
dominant
thought
ever
brooding
on
the
horrors
of
war
and
the
ways
of
peace
during
more
than
twenty
years
and
never
wholly
satisfied
till
its
full
expression
was
completed
in
the
winter
of
there
had
sprung
out
of
his
legal
practice
the
idea
of
a
treatise
entitled
jure
fully
written
out
but
never
printed
by
its
author
the
manuscript
remained
unknown
by
all
his
biographers
until
it
was
brought
to
light
and
printed
under
the
auspices
of
professor
fruin
at
the
hague
in
this
interesting
document
proves
that
not
only
the
general
conception
but
the
entire
plan
and
even
the
arrangement
of
the
jure
belli
ac
were
in
the
mind
of
grotius
when
he
was
only
years
of
age
the
difference
between
the
earlier
work
and
the
later
is
chiefly
one
of
detail
and
amplification
the
difference
which
twenty
years
of
reading
experience
meditation
and
maturity
of
faculty
would
inevitably
create
the
curious
may
find
in
his
letters
the
almost
daily
chronicle
of
his
progress
with
his
book
to
the
time
of
its
publication
after
excessive
labors
lasting
more
than
a
year
in
march
the
printing
of
the
first
edition
which
had
occupied
four
months
was
completed
and
copies
were
sent
to
the
fair
at
frankfort
his
honorarium
as
author
consisted
of
two
hundred
copies
many
of
which
he
presented
to
his
friends
from
the
sale
of
the
remainder
at
a
crown

he
was
not
able
to
reimburse
his
outlay
in
the
following

he
wrote
to
his
father
and
brother
that
if
he
had
their
approbation
and
that
of
a
few
friends
he
would
have
no
cause
for
complaint

would
be
satisfied

seemed

yet
from

grotius
would
not
accept
the
conditions
which
the
cardinal
wished
to
impose
such
at
least
is
the
inevitable
inference
from
his
letters
his
pension
was
not
paid
and
his
circumstances
became
so
serious
that
one
of
his
children
had
but
a
single
coat
at
length
pushed
to
the
utmost
extremity
of
want
and
instigated
by
his
energetic
wife

resolved
to
return
to
holland
driven
from
rotterdam
to
amsterdam
where
he
hoped
to
settle
down
as
a

before
succeeding

more
turned
his
face
toward

set
out
for
hamburg
iv
the
work
of
grotius
it
may
be
of
interest
at
this
point
in
the
career
of
grotius
to
describe
briefly
the
character
of
the
great
work
which
was
soon
to
win
for
him
a
new
celebrity
and
materially
change
his
prospects
in
life
the
inspiration
of
his
jure
belli
ac
was
the
love
of
peace
yet
he
was
far
from
being
one
of
those
visionaries
who
totally
condemn
the
use
of
armed
force
and
proscribe
all
war
as
wrong
and
unnecessary
on
the
contrary
he
seeks
to
discover
when
how
and
by
whom
war
may
be
justly
conducted
his
plan
of
treatment
is
as
follows
in
the
first
book
he
considers
whether
any
war
is
just
which
leads
to
the
distinction
between
public
and
private
war
and
this
in
turn
to
a
discussion
of
the
nature
and
embodiment
of
sovereignty
in
the
second
book
the
causes
from
which
wars
arise
the
nature
of
property
and
personal
rights
which
furnish
their
occasions
the
obligations
that
pertain
to
ownership
the
rule
of
royal
succession
the
rights
secured
by
compacts
the
force
and
interpretation
of
treaties
and
kindred
subjects
are
examined
in
the
third
book
the
question
is
asked
what
is
lawful
war
which
prepares
for
the
consideration
of
military
conventions
and
the
methods
by
which
peace
is
to
be
secured
from
the
authority
of
the
empire
and
the
church
no
longer
effectual
as
an
international
agency
grotius
appeals
to
humanity
as
furnishing
the
true
law
of
nations
beginning
with
the
idea
that
there
is
a
kinship
among
men
established
by
nature
he
sees
in
this
bond
a
community
of
rights
the
society
of
nations
including
as
it
does
the
whole
human
race
needs
the
recognition
of
rights
as
much
as
mere
local
communities
as
nations
are
but
larger
aggregations
of
individuals
each
with
its
own
corporate
coherence
the
accidents
of
geographic
boundary
do
not
obliterate
that
human
demand
for
justice
which
springs
from
the
nature
of
man
as
a
moral
being
there
is
therefore
as
a
fundamental
bond
of
human
societies
a
natural
law
which
when
properly
apprehended
is
perceived
to
be
the
expression
and
dictate
of
right
reason
it
is
thus
upon
the
nature
of
man
as
a
rational
intelligence
that
grotius
founds
his
system
of
universal
law
as
this
law
of
human
nature
is
universally
binding
wherever
men
exist
it
can
not
be
set
aside
by
the
mere
circumstances
of
time
and
place
whence
it
results
that
there
is
a
law
of
war
as
well
as
a
law
of
peace
as
this
law
applies
to
the
commencement
of
armed
conflicts
war
is
never
to
be
undertaken
except
to
assert
rights
and
when
undertaken
is
never
to
be
carried
on
except
within
the
limits
of
rights
it
is
true
that
in
the
conflict
of
arms
laws
must
be
silent
but
only
civil
laws
which
govern
in
times
of
peace
those
laws
which
are
perpetual
which
spring
from
the
nature
of
man
as
man
and
not
from
his
particular
civil
relations
continue
even
during
strife
and
constitute
the
laws
of
war
to
deny
these
or
to
disobey
them
implies
a
repudiation
of
human
nature
itself
and
of
the
divine
authority
which
has
invested
it
with
rights
and
obligations
to
disavow
the
imperative
character
of
these
perpetual
laws
is
to
revert
to
barbarism
it
is
necessary
however
to
distinguish
between
natural
law
that
principle
of
justice
which
springs
from
man
rational
nature
and
conventional
law
which
results
from
his
agreements
and
compacts
natural
law
remains
ever
the
same
but
institutions
change
while
the
study
of
abstract
justice
apart
from
all
that
has
its
origin
in
the
will
or
consent
of
men
would
enable
us
to
create
a
complete
system
of
jurisprudence
there
is
another
source
which
must
not
be
neglected
since
men
have
established
the
sanctity
of
certain
rules
of
conduct
by
solemn
convention
the
law
of
nations
does
not
consist
therefore
of
a
mere
body
of
deductions
derived
from
general
principles
of
justice
for
there
is
also
a
body
of
doctrine
based
upon
consent
and
it
is
this
system
of
voluntarily
recognized
obligations
which
distinguishes
international
jurisprudence
from
mere
ethical
speculation
or
moral
theory
there
are
customs
of
nations
as
well
as
a
universally
accepted
law
of
nature
and
it
is
in
this
growth
of
practically
recognized
rules
of
procedure
that
we
trace
the
evolution
of
law
international
inter
as
a
body
of
positive
jurisprudence
it
is
evident
that
the
mind
of
grotius
is
continually
struggling
to
establish
a
science
upon
this
positive
basis
and
it
is
this
which
gives
a
distinctive
character
to
his
effort
the
great
writers
of
all
ages
are
cited
with
a
superfluous
lavishness
not
so
much
to
support
his
claims
by
an
aggregation
of
individual
opinions
still
less
to
display
his
erudition
as
his
critics
have
sometimes
complained
as
to
give
a
historic
catholicity
to
his
doctrine
by
showing
that
the
laws
he
is
endeavoring
to
formulate
have
in
fact
been
accepted
in
all
times
and
by
all
men
for
this
purpose
also
he
makes
abundant
use
of
the
great
authorities
on
roman
law
whose
doctrines
and
formulas
were
certain
to
carry
conviction
to
the
minds
of
those
whom
he
desired
to
convince
it
is
needless
perhaps
to
point
out
that
the
work
of
grotius
is
not
and
could
not
be
a
work
of
permanent
authority
as
a
digest
of
international
law
his
own
wise
appreciation
of
the
positive
and
historical
element
the
authority
derived
from
custom
should
exempt
him
from
the
pretense
of
absolute
finality
it
is
the
book
of
genesis
only
that
he
has
given
us
but
it
is
his
indefeasible
distinction
to
have
recorded
the
creation
of
order
out
of
chaos
in
the
great
sphere
of
international
relationship
justly
entitling
him
to
the
honor
accorded
to
him
by
the
spontaneous
consent
of
future
times
as
the
father
of
international
jurisprudence
it
is
not
difficult
after
more
than
three
centuries
of
thought
and
experience
to
point
out
the
defects
in
his
doctrine
if
he
justifies
slavery
it
is
not
without
ingenuity
for
he
argues
if
a
man
may
sell
his
labor
why
not
his
liberty
and
if
the
conqueror
may
impose
his
will
upon
the
property
of
the
vanquished
why
not
also
upon
his
person
if
he
identifies
sovereignty
with
supreme
power
without
any
adequate
conception
of
its
ethical
basis
he
is
at
least
as
advanced
in
his
thinking
as
the
conceptions
of
his
time
which
had
not
yet
grasped
the
idea
of
the
state
as
a
moral
organism
if
he
has
no
adequate
notion
of
neutrality
believing
it
to
be
the
duty
of
a
nation
to
enlist
its
energies
for
what
it
deems
the
right
side
rather
than
to
disavow
all
responsibility
for
actions
foreign
to
its
own
interests
he
is
at
least
supported
in
this
by
the
opinion
of
the
multitude
even
at
the
present
time
and
even
among
jurists
the
modern
conception
of
neutrality
is
hardly
a
century
old
if
the
new
schools
of
jurisprudence
make
light
of
natural
law
as
a
foundation
of
public
and
private
rights
it
is
not
certain
that
grotius
may
not
yet
be
vindicated
as
representing
a
doctrine
at
least
as
clear
as
any
other
which
has
been
substituted
for
it
but
finally
to
all
these
criticisms
it
may
be
answered
that
no
great
thinker
can
be
justly
estimated
except
in
relation
to
his
predecessors
and
contemporaries
measured
by
these
grotius
stands
alone
among
the
jurists
of
his
century
for
originality
of
thought
and
power
of
exposition
the
influence
of
grotius
work
it
was
during
his
sojourn
in
hamburg
in
eight
years
after
the
publication
of
his
and
while
he
was
still
suffering
from
painful
pecuniary
embarrassment
that
europe
suddenly
awoke
to
a
sense
of
his
importance
and
almost
at
one
time
poland
denmark
spain
england
and
sweden
all
extended
friendly
invitations
urging
him
to
enter
into
their
public
service
his
fame
as
a
jurist
had
become
international
and
rudely
repelled
by
his
native
holland
he
became
the
center
of
european
interest
gustavus
adolphus
had
placed
the
work
of
grotius
along
side
his
bible
under
his
soldier
pillow
as
he
prosecuted
his
campaigns
in
the
thirty
years
war
the
first
edition
of
that
work
written
in
latin
the
cosmopolitan
language
of
learned
europe
had
been
quickly
exhausted
and
widely
scattered
another
had
soon
been
called
for
at
paris
but
the
death
of
buon
the
publisher
created
obstacles
to
its
appearance
a
second
edition
had
appeared
at
frankfort
in
another
at
amsterdam
in
and
still
another
with
notes
by
the
author
in
the
book
had
aroused
the
thought
of
kings
as
well
as
of
scholars
and
in
the
circles
of
high
influence
everywhere
in
europe
the
name
of
grotius
had
become
well
known
his
book
had
excited
the
most
opposite
sentiments
and
awakened
the
most
contradictory
judgments
but
among
lawyers
and
statesmen
its
reception
was
from
the
first
generally
marked
by
admiration
in
spite
of
exile
poverty
and
misfortune
grotius
had
become
a
european
celebrity
and
was
about
to
enter
into
the
reward
of
his
labors
he
had
created
a
code
for
war
and
a
programme
of
peace
and
henceforth
no
statesman
could
afford
to
neglect
him
gustavus
adolphus
the
king
of
sweden
before
his
death
on
the
battlefield
of
lützen
had
commended
grotius
to
his
great
chancellor
oxenstiern
by
the
death
of
gustavus
the
chancellor
had
in
recently
come
into
the
regency
of
the
kingdom
at
a
critical
moment
when
a
retreat
from
the
bitter
contest
with
the
empire
seemed
to
be
foredoomed
unless
prevented
by
the
support
and
friendship
of
france
recalling
the
commendation
of
the
late
king
oxenstiern
sought
and
found
in
grotius
an
ambassador
of
sweden
to
negotiate
a
new
alliance
accepting
this
appointment
in
grotius
arrived
at
paris
on
his
diplomatic
mission
on
march
richelieu
having
failed
to
draw
the
great
jurist
into
the
orbit
of
his
influence
as
a
satellite
resented
his
appearance
in
a
character
so
influential
and
honorable
as
that
of
ambassador
of
sweden
and
grotius
made
little
progress
in
his
negotiation
preoccupied
with
literature
he
took
more
interest
in
the
composition
of
a
sacred
tragedy
on
the
flight
into
egypt
than
in
reminding
france
of
the
existing
treaty
of
heilbronn
or
consolidating
the
new
alliance
where
grotius
the
theorist
failed
oxenstiern
the
practical
statesman
by
a
few
dexterous
strokes
of
diplomacy
during
a
brief
visit
to
paris
easily
succeeded
and
the
ambassador
mission
was
simplified
to
the
rôle
of
a
mere
observer
and
reporter
of
occurrences
by
taste
nature
and
training
grotius
was
a
jurist
and
not
a
diplomatist
and
he
soon
realized
that
the
two
vocations
if
not
diametrically
opposed
are
at
least
separated
from
each
other
by
a
vast
interval
his
diplomatic
correspondence
betrays
the
keen
observer
and
the
conscientious
moralist
rather
than
the
accomplished
negotiator
among
the
observations
recorded
in
his
dispatches
one
may
be
quoted
as
an
example
of
his
penetration
and
his
humor
speaking
of
the
dauphin
the
future
louis
xiv
he
says
his
frightful
and
precocious
avidity
is
a
bad
omen
for
neighboring
peoples
for
he
is
at
present
on
his
ninth
nurse
whom
he
is
rending
and
murdering
as
he
has
the
others
it
is
painful
to
behold
the
great
father
of
international
jurisprudence
descending
in
his
dispatches
to
petty
details
of
precedence
and
alienating
from
himself
the
sympathies
of
his
colleagues
by
ridiculous
ceremonial
pretensions
he
would
no
longer
visit
mazarin
because
the
cardinal
insisted
on
calling
him
eminence
instead
of
excellence
grotius
considering
this
distinction
of
terms
a
slight
upon
his
rank
as
ambassador
so
persistent
was
he
in
these
follies
and
so
rancorous
were
the
feuds
that
the
apostle
of
peace
elicited
that
in
december
less
than
two
years
after
his
arrival
at
paris
he
advised
sweden
to
send
to
france
a
simple
instead
of
an
ambassador
in
order
to
restore
diplomatic
relations
his
quarrels
concerning
precedence
which
rendered
him
an
object
of
ridicule
at
the
french
court
were
not
the
only
griefs
of
the
ambassador
of
sweden
inadequately
recompensed
he
was
obliged
to
wait
two
years
for
his
salary
and
finally
being
reduced
to
a
condition
in
which
he
could
no
longer
maintain
existence
otherwise
he
was
compelled
to
demand
of
the
royal
treasury
of
france
a
part
of
the
subsidies
promised
to
the
army
of
his
adopted
country
weary
of
his
importunities
the
french
government
repeatedly
requested
his
recall
disgusted
with
his
mission
grotius
at
last
abandoned
the
duties
of
his
office
to
the
intriguing
adventurer
cerisante
who
was
sent
to
aid
him
and
buried
himself
in
his
books
until
his
return
to
sweden
at
his
own
request
in
queen
christina
of
sweden
a
patroness
of
scholars
desirous
of
aiding
grotius
and
of
retaining
him
in
the
service
of
her
kingdom
made
many
offers
and
promises
but
their
execution
being
deferred
he
became
impatient
of
his
lot
refused
a
position
as
counselor
of
state
and
resolved
to
leave
the
country
his
plan
to
abandon
stockholm
secretly
was
prevented
by
a
messenger
of
the
queen
who
followed
him
to
the
port
where
he
intended
to
embark
and
induced
him
to
return
for
a
farewell
audience
with
a
handsome
present
of
money
and
silver
plate
he
took
passage
on
a
vessel
placed
at
his
disposition
to
convey
him
to
lübeck
off
the
coast
near
dantzic
a
violent
tempest
arose
on
the
of
august
the
vessel
was
driven
ashore
and
grotius
overcome
by
his
trying
experiences
was
taken
ill
at
rostock
where
a
few
days
later
he
passed
away
the
later
years
of
his
life
had
been
chiefly
devoted
to
plans
for
the
establishment
of
peace
in
the
religious
world
whose
dissensions
gave
him
great
distress
of
mind
the
country
of
his
birth
which
had
so
long
denied
him
citizenship
received
him
at
last
to
the
silent
hospitality
of
the
tomb
his
body
was
taken
to
delft
his
native
town
where
his
name
is
now
held
in
grateful
reverence
at
the
time
when
grotius
left
stockholm
the
last
of
the
plenipotentiaries
had
arrived
at
münster
and
osnabrück
to
attend
the
great
european
congress
convoked
to
terminate
the
hostilities
of
the
thirty
years
war
it
is
a
tradition
but
incapable
of
satisfactory
proof
that
it
was
with
the
purpose
of
being
present
at
the
councils
of
this
congress
that
the
author
of
jure
belli
ac
left
sweden
for
germany
however
this
may
be
it
is
certain
that
the
mediation
of
the
king
of
denmark
at
osnabrück
and
of
the
papal
legate
at
münster
though
unsuccessful
was
in
accordance
with
the
idea
of
grotius
expressed
in
the
words
it
would
be
useful
and
indeed
it
is
almost
necessary
that
certain
congresses
of
christian
powers
should
be
held
in
which
controversies
that
have
arisen
among
some
of
them
may
be
decided
by
others
who
are
not
interested
the
immediate
establishment
of
an
international
tribunal
evidently
contemplated
in
this
suggestion
was
not
in
harmony
with
the
temper
of
those
times
but
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
the
peace
of
westphalia
whose
treaties
were
to
form
a
code
of
public
law
for
europe
was
to
a
great
degree
an
embodiment
of
the
principles
which
grotius
was
the
first
to
enunciate
his
jure
belli
ac
had
already
become
a
classic
even
before
the
author
death
and
special
professorships
were
soon
founded
in
the
universities
to
expound
its
principles
it
would
be
tedious
to
name
the
numerous
editions
translations
and
commentaries
which
have
given
it
an
exceptional
place
in
the
literature
of
europe
this
task
has
been
in
part
performed
however
by
rogge
in
his
published
at
the
hague
in
and
intended
to
be
a
full
bibliography
of
grotius
works
the
whole
number
of
titles
included
is
but
they
do
not
comprise
the
writings
of
the
generations
of
jurists
who
have
been
inspired
by
the
great
master
or
of
the
critics
and
biographers
who
have
discussed
his
life
and
work
tardily
but
with
full
contrition
for
the
bitter
wrong
done
to
one
of
her
greatest
and
noblest
sons
the
memory
of
grotius
has
received
from
his
native
land
abundant
recognition
and
commemoration
the
appropriate
tomb
that
marks
his
resting
place
in
the
nieuwe
kerk
at
delft

of
his
learning

and
renown

erected
in
on
the
of

a

statue
of
the
great
jurist
was
unveiled
in
the
public
square
of
his
native
town
in
front
of
the
church
which
contains
his
tomb
thus
more
than
a
century
after
his
death
and
again
still
another
century
later
holland
has
paid
her
tribute
of
respect
to
her
illustrious
citizen

honors

great
structure
of

comity
whose
corner
stone
was
laid
by
him
in
it
was
most
fitting
that
an
international
congress
called
in
the
interest
of
peace
should
blend
with
the
negotiation
of
conventions
for
the
pacific
settlement
of
disputes
between
nations
by
a
permanent
tribunal
and
for
the
amelioration
of
the

of
the

received
from
the

invited
their

and
the
high
civic
authorities
to
join
with
them
in
observing
the

by
celebrating
the

of
the
great

appropriate

that

to
decide
their
dissensions
like
the
ancient
patriarchs
who
formed
no
national
community
or
the
numerous
unconnected
communities
whether
under
the
direction
of
individuals
or
kings
or
persons
invested
with

power
as
the
leading
men
in
an
aristocracy
and
the
body
of

in

republican
government
the
disputes
arising
among
any
of
these
all
bear
a
relation
to
the
circumstances
of
war
or
peace
but
because
war
is
undertaken
for
the
sake
of
peace
and
there
is
no
dispute
which
may
not
give
rise
to
war
it
will
be
proper
to
treat
all
such
quarrels
as
commonly
happen
between
nations
as
an
article
in
the
rights
of
war
and
then
war
itself
will
lead
us
to
peace
as
to
its
proper
end
ii
in
treating
of
the
rights
of
war
the
first
point
that
we
have
to
consider
is
what
is
war
which
is
the
subject
of
our
inquiry
and
what
is
the
right
which
we
seek
to
establish
cicero
styled
war
a
contention
by
force
but
the
practice
has
prevailed
to
indicate
by
that
name
not
an
immediate
action
but
a
state
of
affairs
so
that
war
is
the
state
of
contending
parties
considered
as
such
this
definition
by
its
general
extent
comprises
those
wars
of
every
description
that
will
form
the
subject
of
the
present
treatise
nor
are
single
combats
excluded
from
this
definition
for
as
they
are
in
reality
more
ancient
than
public
wars
and
undoubtedly
of
the
same
nature
they
may
therefore
properly
be
comprehended
under
one
and
the
same
name
this
agrees
very
well
with
the
true
derivation
of
the
word
for
the
latin
word
war
comes
from
the
old
word
a
duel
as
from
and
from
now
was
derived
from
and
thereby
implied
a
difference
between
two
persons
in
the
same
sense
as
we
term
peace
unity
from
for
a
contrary
reason
so
the
greek
word
πολεμος
polemos
commonly
used
to
signify
war
expresses
in
its
original
an
idea
of
multitude
the
ancient
greeks
likewise
called
it
λυη
lyê
which
imports
a
disunion
of
minds
just
as
by
the
term
δυη
dyê
they
meant
the
dissolution
of
the
parts
of
the
body
nor
does
the
use
of
the
word
war
contradict
this
larger
acceptation
of
it
for
though
some
times
it
is
only
applied
to
the
quarrels
of
states
yet
that
is
no
objection
as
it
is
evident
that
a
general
name
is
often
applied
to
some
particular
object
entitled
to
peculiar
distinction
justice
is
not
included
in
the
definition
of
war
because
the
very
point
to
be
decided
is
whether
any
war
is
just
and
what
war
may
be
so
called
therefore
we
must
make
a
distinction
between
war
itself
and
the
justice
of
it
iii
as
the
rights
of
war
is
the
title
by
which
this
treatise
is
distinguished
the
first
inquiry
as
it
has
been
already
observed
is
whether
any
war
be
just
and
in
the
next
place
what
constitutes
the
justice
of
that
war
for
in
this
place
right
signifies
nothing
more
than
what
is
just
and
that
more
in
a
negative
than
a
positive
sense
so
that
right
is
that
which
is
not
unjust
now
any
thing
is
unjust
which
is
repugnant
to
the
nature
of
society
established
among
rational
creatures
thus
for
instance
to
deprive
another
of
what
belongs
to
him
merely
for
one
own
advantage
is
repugnant
to
the
law
of
nature
as
cicero
observes
in
the
fifth
chapter
of
his
third
book
of
offices
and
by
way
of
proof
he
says
that
if
the
practice
were
general
all
society
and
intercourse
among
men
must
be
overturned
florentinus
the
lawyer
maintains
that
is
impious
for
one
man
to
form
designs
against
another
as
nature
has
established
a
degree
of
kindred
amongst
us
on
this
subject
seneca
remarks
that
as
all
the
members
of
the
human
body
agree
among
themselves
because
the
preservation
of
each
conduces
to
the
welfare
of
the
whole
so
men
should
forbear
from
mutual
injuries
as
they
were
born
for
society
which
can
not
subsist
unless
all
the
parts
of
it
are
defended
by
mutual
forbearance
and
good
will
but
as
there
is
one
kind
of
social
tie
founded
upon
an
equality
for
instance
among
brothers
citizens
friends
allies
and
another
on
as
aristotle
styles
it
subsisting
between
parents
and
children
masters
and
servants
sovereigns
and
subjects
god
and
men
so
justice
takes
place
either
amongst
equals
or
between
the
governing
and
the
governed
parties
notwithstanding
their
difference
of
rank
the
former
of
these
if
i
am
not
mistaken
may
be
called
the
right
of
equality
and
the
latter
the
right
of
superiority
iv
there
is
another
signification
of
the
word
right
different
from
this
but
yet
arising
from
it
which
relates
directly
to
the
person
in
which
sense
right
is
a
moral
quality
annexed
to
the
person
justly
entitling
him
to
possess
some
particular
privilege
or
to
perform
some
particular
act
this
right
is
annexed
to
the
person
although
it
sometimes
follows
the
things
as
the
services
of
lands
which
are
called
real
rights
in
opposition
to
those
merely
personal
not
because
these
rights
are
not
annexed
to
persons
but
the
distinction
is
made
because
they
belong
to
the
persons
only
who
possess
some
particular
things
this
moral
quality
when
perfect
is
called
a
faculty
when
imperfect
an
aptitude
the
former
answers
to
the
act
and
the
latter
to
the
power
when
we
speak
of
natural
things
civilians
call
a
faculty
that
right
which
every
man
has
to
his
own
but
we
shall
hereafter
taking
it
in
its
strict
and
proper
sense
call
it
a
right
this
right
comprehends
the
power
that
we
have
over
ourselves
which
is
called
liberty
and
the
power
that
we
have
over
others
as
that
of
a
father
over
his
children
and
of
a
master
over
his
slaves
it
likewise
comprehends
property
which
is
either
complete
or
imperfect
of
the
latter
kind
is
the
use
or
possession
of
any
thing
without
the
property
or
power
of
alienating
it
or
pledges
detained
by
the
creditors
till
payment
be
made
there
is
a
third
signification
which
implies
the
power
of
demanding
what
is
due
to
which
the
obligation
upon
the
party
indebted
to
discharge
what
is
owing
corresponds
vi
right
strictly
taken
is
again
twofold
the
one
private
established
for
the
advantage
of
each
individual
the
other
superior
as
involving
the
claims
which
the
state
has
upon
individuals
and
their
property
for
the
public
good
thus
the
regal
authority
is
above
that
of
a
father
and
a
master
and
the
sovereign
has
a
greater
right
over
the
property
of
his
subjects
where
the
public
good
is
concerned
than
the
owners
themselves
have
and
when
the
exigencies
of
the
state
require
a
supply
every
man
is
more
obliged
to
contribute
towards
it
than
to
satisfy
his
creditors
vii
aristotle
distinguishes
aptitude
or
capacity
by
the
name
of
worth
or
merit
and
michael
of
ephesus
gives
the
epithet
of
suitable
or
becoming
to
the
equality
established
by
this
rule
of
merit
ix
there
is
also
a
third
signification
of
the
word
right
which
has
the
same
meaning
as
law
taken
in
its
most
extensive
sense
to
denote
a
rule
of
moral
action
obliging
us
to
do
what
is
proper
we
say
obliging
us
for
the
best
counsels
or
precepts
if
they
lay
us
under
no
obligation
to
obey
them
can
not
come
under
the
denomination
of
law
or
right
now
as
to
permission
it
is
no
act
of
the
law
but
only
the
silence
of
the
law
it
however
prohibits
any
one
from
impeding
another
in
doing
what
the
law
permits
but
we
have
said
the
law
obliges
us
to
do
what
is
proper
not
simply
what
is
just
because
under
this
notion
right
belongs
to
the
substance
not
only
of
justice
as
we
have
explained
it
but
of
all
other
virtues
yet
from
giving
the
name
of
a
right
to
that
which
is
proper
a
more
general
acceptation
of
the
word
justice
has
been
derived
the
best
division
of
right
in
this
general
meaning
is
to
be
found
in
aristotle
who
defining
one
kind
to
be
natural
and
the
other
voluntary
calls
it
a
lawful
right
in
the
strictest
sense
of
the
word
law
and
some
times
an
instituted
right
the
same
difference
is
found
among
the
hebrews
who
by
way
of
distinction
in
speaking
call
that
natural
right
precepts
and
the
voluntary
right
statutes
the
former
of
which
the
septuagint
call
δικαιώματα
dikaiômata
and
the
latter
ἐντολας
entolas
x
natural
right
is
the
dictate
of
right
reason
shewing
the
moral
turpitude
or
moral
necessity
of
any
act
from
its
agreement
or
disagreement
with
a
rational
nature
and
consequently
that
such
an
act
is
either
forbidden
or
commanded
by
god
the
author
of
nature
the
actions
upon
which
such
a
dictate
is
given
are
either
binding
or
unlawful
in
themselves
and
therefore
necessarily
understood
to
be
commanded
or
forbidden
by
god
this
mark
distinguishes
natural
right
not
only
from
human
law
but
from
the
law
which
god
himself
has
been
pleased
to
reveal
called
by
some
the
voluntary
divine
right
which
does
not
command
or
forbid
things
in
themselves
either
binding
or
unlawful
but
makes
them
unlawful
by
its
prohibition
and
binding
by
its
command
but
to
understand
natural
right
we
must
observe
that
some
things
are
said
to
belong
to
that
right
not
properly
but
as
the
schoolmen
say
by
way
of
accommodation
these
are
not
repugnant
to
natural
right
as
we
have
already
observed
that
those
things
are
called
just
in
which
there
is
no
injustice
some
times
also
by
a
wrong
use
of
the
word
those
things
which
reason
shews
to
be
proper
or
better
than
things
of
an
opposite
kind
although
not
binding
are
said
to
belong
to
natural
right
we
must
farther
remark
that
natural
right
relates
not
only
to
those
things
that
exist
independent
of
the
human
will
but
to
many
things
which
necessarily
follow
the
exercise
of
that
will
thus
property
as
now
in
use
was
at
first
a
creature
of
the
human
will
but
after
it
was
established
one
man
was
prohibited
by
the
law
of
nature
from
seizing
the
property
of
another
against
his
will
wherefore
paulus
the
lawyer
said
that
theft
is
expressly
forbidden
by
the
law
of
nature
ulpian
condemns
it
as
infamous
in
its
own
nature
to
whose
authority
that
of
euripides
may
be
added
as
may
be
seen
in
the
verses
of
helena
for
god
himself
hates
violence
and
will
not
have
us
to
grow
rich
by
rapine
but
by
lawful
gains
that
abundance
which
is
the
fruit
of
unrighteousness
is
an
abomination
the
air
is
common
to
men
the
earth
also
where
every
man
in
the
ample
enjoyment
of
his
possession
must
refrain
from
doing
violence
or
injury
to
that
of
another
now
the
law
of
nature
is
so
unalterable
that
it
can
not
be
changed
even
by
god
himself
for
although
the
power
of
god
is
infinite
yet
there
are
some
things
to
which
it
does
not
extend
because
the
things
so
expressed
would
have
no
true
meaning
but
imply
a
contradiction
thus
two
and
two
must
make
four
nor
is
it
possible
to
be
otherwise
nor
again
can
what
is
really
evil
not
be
evil
and
this
is
meaning
when
he
says
that
some
things
are
no
sooner
named
than
we
discover
their
evil
nature
for
as
the
substance
of
things
in
their
nature
and
existence
depends
upon
nothing
but
themselves
so
there
are
qualities
inseparably
connected
with
their
being
and
essence
of
this
kind
is
the
evil
of
certain
actions
compared
with
the
nature
of
a
reasonable
being
therefore
god
himself
suffers
his
actions
to
be
judged
by
this
rule
as
may
be
seen
in
the
xviiith
chap
of
isa
ezek
xviii
jer
ii
vi
rom
ii
iii
yet
it
sometimes
happens
that
in
those
cases
which
are
decided
by
the
law
of
nature
the
undiscerning
are
imposed
upon
by
an
appearance
of
change
whereas
in
reality
there
is
no
change
in
the
unalterable
law
of
nature
but
only
in
the
things
appointed
by
it
and
which
are
liable
to
variation
for
example
if
a
creditor
forgive
me
the
debt
which
i
owe
him
i
am
no
longer
bound
to
pay
it
not
because
the
law
of
nature
has
ceased
to
command
the
payment
of
a
just
debt
but
because
my
debt
by
a
release
has
ceased
to
be
a
debt
on
this
topic
arrian
in
epictetus
argues
rightly
that
the
borrowing
of
money
is
not
the
only
requisite
to
make
a
debt
but
there
must
be
the
additional
circumstance
of
the
loan
remaining
undischarged
thus
if
god
should
command
the
life
or
property
of
any
one
to
be
taken
away
the
act
would
not
authorise
murder
or
robbery
words
which
always
include
a
crime
but
that
can
not
be
murder
or
robbery
which
is
done
by
the
express
command
of
him
who
is
the
sovereign
lord
of
our
lives
and
of
all
things
there
are
also
some
things
allowed
by
the
law
of
nature
not
absolutely
but
according
to
a
certain
state
of
affairs
thus
by
the
law
of
nature
before
property
was
introduced
every
one
had
a
right
to
the
use
of
whatever
he
found
unoccupied
and
before
laws
were
enacted
to
avenge
his
personal
injuries
by
force
xi
the
distinction
found
in
the
books
of
the
roman
law
assigning
one
unchangeable
right
to
brutes
in
common
with
man
which
in
a
more
limited
sense
they
call
the
law
of
nature
and
appropriating
another
to
men
which
they
frequently
call
the
law
of
nations
is
scarcely
of
any
real
use
for
no
beings
except
those
that
can
form
general
maxims
are
capable
of
possessing
a
right
which
hesiod
has
placed
in
a
clear
point
of
view
observing
that
the
supreme
being
has
appointed
laws
for
men
but
permitted
wild
beasts
fishes
and
birds
to
devour
each
other
for
food
for
they
have
nothing
like
justice
the
best
gift
bestowed
upon
men
cicero
in
his
first
book
of
offices
says
we
do
not
talk
of
the
justice
of
horses
or
lions
in
conformity
to
which
plutarch
in
the
life
of
cato
the
elder
observes
that
we
are
formed
by
nature
to
use
law
and
justice
towards
men
only
in
addition
to
the
above
lactantius
may
be
cited
who
in
his
fifth
book
says
that
in
all
animals
devoid
of
reason
we
see
a
natural
bias
of
for
they
hurt
others
to
benefit
themselves
because
they
do
not
know
the
evil
of
doing
wilful
hurt
but
it
is
not
so
with
man
who
possessing
the
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
refrains
even
with
inconvenience
to
himself
from
doing
hurt
polybius
relating
the
manner
in
which
men
first
entered
into
society
concludes
that
the
injuries
done
to
parents
or
benefactors
inevitably
provoke
the
indignation
of
mankind
giving
an
additional
reason
that
as
understanding
and
reflection
form
the
great
difference
between
men
and
other
animals
it
is
evident
they
can
not
transgress
the
bounds
of
that
difference
like
other
animals
without
exciting
universal
abhorrence
of
their
conduct
but
if
ever
justice
is
attributed
to
brutes
it
is
done
improperly
from
some
shadow
and
trace
of
reason
they
may
possess
but
it
is
not
material
to
the
nature
of
right
whether
the
actions
appointed
by
the
law
of
nature
such
as
the
care
of
our
offspring
are
common
to
us
with
other
animals
or
not
or
like
the
worship
of
god
are
peculiar
to
man
xii
the
existence
of
the
law
of
nature
is
proved
by
two
kinds
of
argument
and
the
former
a
more
abstruse
and
the
latter
a
more
popular
method
of
proof
we
are
said
to
reason
when
we
show
the
agreement
or
disagreement
of
any
thing
with
a
reasonable
and
social
nature
but
when
without
absolute
proof
but
only
upon
probability
any
thing
is
inferred
to
accord
with
the
law
of
nature
because
it
is
received
as
such
among
all
or
at
least
the
more
civilized
nations
for
a
general
effect
can
only
arise
from
a
general
cause
now
scarce
any
other
cause
can
be
assigned
for
so
general
an
opinion
but
the
common
sense
as
it
is
called
of
mankind
there
is
a
sentence
of
hesiod
that
has
been
much
praised
that
opinions
which
have
prevailed
amongst
many
nations
must
have
some
foundation
heraclitus
establishing
common
reason
as
the
best
criterion
of
truth
says
those
things
are
certain
which
generally
appear
so
among
other
authorities
we
may
quote
aristotle
who
says
it
is
a
strong
proof
in
our
favour
when
all
appear
to
agree
with
what
we
say
and
cicero
maintains
that
the
consent
of
all
nations
in
any
case
is
to
be
admitted
for
the
law
of
nature
seneca
is
of
the
same
opinion
any
thing
says
he
appearing
the
same
to
all
men
is
a
proof
of
its
truth
quintilian
says
we
hold
those
things
to
be
true
in
which
all
men
agree
we
have
called
them
the
more
civilized
nations
and
not
without
reason
for
as
porphyry
well
observes
some
nations
are
so
strange
that
no
fair
judgment
of
human
nature
can
be
formed
from
them
for
it
would
be
erroneous
andronicus
the
rhodian
says
that
with
men
of
a
right
and
sound
understanding
natural
justice
is
unchangeable
nor
does
it
alter
the
case
though
men
of
disordered
and
perverted
minds
think
otherwise
for
he
who
should
deny
that
honey
is
sweet
because
it
appears
not
so
to
men
of
a
distempered
taste
would
be
wrong
plutarch
too
agrees
entirely
with
what
has
been
said
as
appears
from
a
passage
in
his
life
of
pompey
affirming
that
man
neither
was
nor
is
by
nature
a
wild
unsociable
creature
but
it
is
the
corruption
of
his
nature
which
makes
him
so
yet
by
acquiring
new
habits
by
changing
his
place
and
way
of
living
he
may
be
reclaimed
to
his
original
gentleness
aristotle
taking
a
description
of
man
from
his
peculiar
qualities
makes
him
an
animal
of
a
gentle
nature
and
in
another
part
of
his
works
he
observes
that
in
considering
the
nature
of
man
we
are
to
take
our
likeness
from
nature
in
its
pure
and
not
in
its
corrupt
state
xiii
it
has
been
already
remarked
that
there
is
another
kind
of
right
which
is
the
voluntary
right
deriving
its
origin
from
the
will
and
is
either
human
or
divine
xiv
we
will
begin
with
the
human
as
more
generally
known
now
this
is
either
a
civil
right
or
a
right
more
or
less
extensive
than
the
civil
right
the
civil
right
is
that
which
is
derived
from
the
civil
power
the
civil
power
is
the
sovereign
power
of
the
state
a
state
is
a
perfect
body
of
free
men
united
together
in
order
to
enjoy
common
rights
and
advantages
the
less
extensive
right
and
not
derived
from
the
civil
power
itself
although
subject
to
it
is
various
comprehending
the
authority
of
parents
over
children
masters
over
servants
and
the
like
but
the
law
of
nations
is
a
more
extensive
right
deriving
its
authority
from
the
consent
of
all
or
at
least
of
many
nations
it
was
proper
to
add
many
because
scarce
any
right
can
be
found
common
to
all
nations
except
the
law
of
nature
which
itself
too
is
generally
called
the
law
of
nations
nay
frequently
in
one
part
of
the
world
that
is
held
for
the
law
of
nations
which
is
not
so
in
another
now
this
law
of
nations
is
proved
in
the
same
manner
as
the
unwritten
civil
law
and
that
is
by
the
continual
experience
and
testimony
of
the
sages
of
the
law
for
this
law
as
dio
chrysostom
well
observes
is
the
discoveries
made
by
experience
and
time
and
in
this
we
derive
great
advantage
from
the
writings
of
eminent
historians
xv
the
very
meaning
of
the
words
divine
voluntary
right
shows
that
it
springs
from
the
divine
will
by
which
it
is
distinguished
from
natural
law
which
it
has
already
been
observed
is
called
divine
also
this
law
admits
of
what
anaxarchus
said
as
plutarch
relates
in
the
life
of
alexander
though
without
sufficient
accuracy
that
god
does
not
will
a
thing
because
it
is
just
but
that
it
is
just
or
binding
because
god
wills
it
now
this
law
was
given
either
to
mankind
in
general
or
to
one
particular
people
we
find
three
periods
at
which
it
was
given
by
god
to
the
human
race
the
first
of
which
was
immediately
after
the
creation
of
man
the
second
upon
the
restoration
of
mankind
after
the
flood
and
the
third
upon
that
more
glorious
restoration
through
jesus
christ
these
three
laws
undoubtedly
bind
all
men
as
soon
as
they
come
to
a
sufficient
knowledge
of
them
xvi
of
all
nations
there
is
but
one
to
which
god
particularly
vouchsafed
to
give
laws
and
that
was
the
people
of
israel
whom
moses
thus
addresses
in
the
fourth
chap
of
deuteronomy
ver
what
nation
is
there
so
great
who
hath
god
so
nigh
unto
them
as
the
lord
our
god
is
in
all
things
that
we
call
upon
him
for
and
what
nation
is
there
so
great
who
have
statutes
and
judgments
so
righteous
as
all
this
law
which
i
set
before
you
this
day
and
the
psalmist
in
the
cxlvii
psalm
god
shewed
his
word
unto
jacob
his
statutes
and
ordinances
unto
israel
he
hath
not
dealt
so
with
any
nation
and
as
for
his
judgments
they
have
not
known
them
nor
can
we
doubt
but
that
those
jews
with
whom
we
may
class
tryphon
in
his
dispute
with
justin
are
mistaken
who
suppose
that
even
strangers
if
they
wish
to
be
saved
must
submit
to
the
yoke
of
the
mosaic
law
for
a
law
does
not
bind
those
to
whom
it
has
not
been
given
but
it
speaks
personally
to
those
who
are
immediately
under
it
hear
o
israel
and
we
read
everywhere
of
the
covenant
made
with
them
by
which
they
became
the
peculiar
people
of
god
maimonides
acknowledges
and
proves
the
truth
of
this
from
the
xxxiii
chapter
and
fourth
verse
of
deuteronomy
but
among
the
hebrews
themselves
there
were
always
living
some
strangers
persons
devout
and
fearing
god
such
was
the
syrophoenician
woman
mentioned
in
the
gospel
of
matthew
xv
cornelius
the
centurion
acts
the
devout
greeks
acts
xviii
sojourners
or
strangers
also
are
mentioned
levit
xxv
these
as
the
hebrew
rabbis
themselves
inform
us
were
obliged
to
observe
the
laws
given
to
adam
and
noah
to
abstain
from
idols
and
blood
and
other
things
that
were
prohibited
but
not
in
the
same
manner
to
observe
the
laws
peculiar
to
the
people
of
israel
therefore
though
the
israelites
were
not
allowed
to
eat
the
flesh
of
a
beast
that
had
died
a
natural
death
yet
the
strangers
living
among
them
were
permitted
deut
xiv
except
in
some
particular
laws
where
it
was
expressly
said
that
strangers
no
less
than
the
native
inhabitants
were
obliged
to
observe
them
strangers
also
who
came
from
other
countries
and
were
not
subject
to
the
jewish
laws
might
worship
god
in
the
temple
of
jerusalem
but
standing
in
a
place
separate
and
distinct
from
the
israelites
kings

nor
did
elisha
ever
signify
to
naaman
the
syrian
nor
jonas
to
the
ninevites
nor
daniel
to
nebuchadnezzar
nor
the
other
prophets
to
the
tyrians
the
moabites
the
egyptians
to
whom
they
wrote
that
it
was
necessary
for
them
to
adopt
the
mosaic
law
what
has
been
said
of
the
whole
law
of
moses
applies
to
circumcision
which
was
a
kind
of
introduction
to
the
law
yet
with
this
difference
that
the
israelites
alone
were
bound
by
the
mosaic
law
but
the
whole
posterity
of
abraham
by
the
law
of
circumcision
from
hence
we
are
informed
by
jewish
and
greek
historians
that
the
idumaeans
or
edomites
were
compelled
by
the
jews
to
be
circumcised
wherefore
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
the
numerous
nations
who
besides
the
israelites
practised
circumcision
and
who
are
mentioned
by
herodotus
strabo
philo
justin
origen
clemens
alexandrinus
epiphanius
and
jerom
were
descended
from
ishmael
esau
or
the
posterity
of
keturah
but
what
paul
says
rom
ii
holds
good
of
all
other
nations
that
the
gentiles
not
having
the
law
yet
doing
by
nature
the
things
contained
in
the
law
become
a
law
to
themselves
here
the
word
nature
may
be
taken
for
the
primitive
source
of
moral
obligation
or
referring
it
to
the
preceding
parts
of
the
epistle
it
may
signify
the
knowledge
which
the
gentiles
acquired
of
themselves
without
instruction
in
opposition
to
the
knowledge
derived
to
the
jews
from
the
law
which
was
instilled
into
them
from
their
cradle
and
almost
from
their
birth
so
the
gentiles
show
the
work
or
the
moral
precepts
of
the
law
written
in
their
hearts
their
consciences
also
bearing
witness
and
their
thoughts
the
mean
while
accusing
or
else
excusing
one
another
and
again
in
the
ver
if
the
uncircumcision
keep
the
righteousness
of
the
law
shall
not
his
uncircumcision
be
counted
for
circumcision
therefore
ananias
the
jew
as
we
find
in
the
history
of
josephus
very
properly
taught
tzates
or
as
tacitus
calls
him
ezates
the
adiabenian
that
even
without
circumcision
god
might
be
rightly
worshipped
and
rendered
propitious
for
though
many
strangers
were
circumcised
among
the
jews
and
by
circumcision
bound
themselves
to
observe
the
law
as
paul
explains
it
in
gal
they
did
it
partly
to
obtain
the
freedom
of
the
country
for
proselytes
called
by
the
hebrews
proselytes
of
righteousness
enjoyed
equal
privileges
with
the
israelites
num
xv
and
partly
to
obtain
a
share
in
those
promises
which
were
not
common
to
mankind
but
peculiar
to
the
jewish
people
although
it
can
not
be
denied
that
in
later
ages
an
erroneous
opinion
prevailed
that
there
was
no
salvation
out
of
the
jewish
pale
hence
we
may
infer
that
we
are
bound
by
no
part
of
the
levitical
law
strictly
and
properly
so
called
because
any
obligation
beyond
that
arising
from
the
law
of
nature
must
proceed
from
the
express
will
of
the
now
it
can
not
be
discovered
by
any
proof
that
god
intended
any
other
people
but
the
israelites
to
be
bound
by
that
law
therefore
with
respect
to
ourselves
we
have
no
occasion
to
prove
an
abrogation
of
that
law
for
it
could
never
be
abrogated
with
respect
to
those
whom
it
never
bound
but
the
israelites
were
released
from
the
ceremonial
part
as
soon
as
the
law
of
the
gospel
was
proclaimed
a
clear
revelation
of
which
was
made
to
one
of
the
apostles
acts
x
and
the
other
parts
of
the
mosaic
law
lost
their
peculiar
distinction
when
the
jews
ceased
to
be
a
people
by
the
desolation
and
destruction
of
their
city
without
any
hopes
of
restoration
indeed
it
was
not
a
release
from
the
law
of
moses
that
we
who
were
strangers
to
the
commonwealth
of
israel
obtained
by
the
coming
of
christ
but
as
before
that
time
our
hopes
in
the
goodness
of
god
were
obscure
and
uncertain
we
gained
the
assurance
of
an
express
covenant
that
we
should
be
united
in
one
church
with
the
seed
of
israel
the
children
of
the
patriarchs
their
law
that
was
the
wall
of
separation
between
us
being
broken
down
eph
ii
xvii
since
then
the
law
given
by
moses
imposes
no
direct
obligation
upon
us
as
it
has
been
already
shown
let
us
consider
whether
it
has
any
other
use
both
in
this
inquiry
into
the
rights
of
war
and
in
other
questions
of
the
same
kind
in
the
first
place
the
mosaic
law
shows
that
what
it
enjoins
is
not
contrary
to
the
law
of
nature
for
since
the
law
of
nature
is
perpetual
and
unchangeable
nothing
contradictory
to
it
could
be
commanded
by
god
who
is
never
unjust
besides
the
law
of
moses
is
called
in
the
xix
psalm
an
undefiled
and
right
law
and
paul
rom
vii
describes
it
to
be
holy
just
and
good
its
precepts
are
here
spoken
of
for
its
permissions
require
a
more
distinct
discussion
for
the
bare
permission
signifying
the
removal
of
an
impediment
or
prohibition
has
no
relation
to
the
present
subject
a
positive
legal
permission
is
either
full
granting
us
power
to
do
some
particular
act
without
the
least
restriction
or
less
full
only
allowing
men
impunity
for
certain
actions
and
a
right
to
do
them
without
molestation
from
others
from
the
permission
of
the
former
kind
no
less
than
from
a
positive
precept
it
follows
that
what
the
law
allows
is
not
contrary
to
the
law
of
nature
but
with
regard
to
the
latter
kind
of
permission
allowing
impunity
for
certain
acts
but
not
expressly
authorizing
them
we
can
not
so
readily
conclude
those
acts
to
be
conformable
to
the
law
of
nature
because
where
the
words
of
permission
are
ambiguous
in
their
meaning
it
is
better
for
us
to
interpret
according
to
the
established
law
of
nature
what
kind
of
permission
it
is
than
from
our
conception
of
its
expediency
to
conclude
it
conformable
to
the
laws
of
nature
connected
with
this
first
observation
there
is
another
expressive
of
the
power
that
obtains
among
christian
princes
to
enact
laws
of
the
same
import
with
those
given
by
moses
except
such
as
related
entirely
to
the
time
of
the
expected
messiah
and
the
gospel
then
unrevealed
or
where
christ
himself
has
in
a
general
or
particular
manner
established
any
thing
to
the
contrary
for
except
in
these
three
cases
no
reason
can
be
devised
why
any
thing
established
by
the
law
of
moses
should
be
now
unlawful
in
the
third
place
it
may
be
observed
that
whatever
the
law
of
moses
enjoined
relating
to
those
virtues
which
christ
required
of
his
disciples
should
be
fulfilled
by
christians
now
in
a
greater
degree
from
their
superior
knowledge
and
higher
motives
thus
the
virtues
of
humility
patience
and
charity
are
required
of
christians
in
a
more
perfect
manner
than
of
the
jews
under
the
mosaic
dispensation
because
the
promises
of
heaven
are
more
clearly
laid
before
us
in
the
gospel
hence
the
old
law
when
compared
with
the
gospel
is
said
to
have
been
neither
perfect
nor
faultless
and
christ
is
said
to
be
the
end
of
the
law
and
the
law
our
schoolmaster
to
bring
us
to
christ
thus
the
old
law
respecting
the
sabbath
and
the
law
respecting
tithes
show
that
christians
are
bound
to
devote
not
less
than
a
seventh
portion
of
their
time
to
divine
worship
nor
less
than
a
tenth
of
their
fruits
to
maintain
those
who
are
employed
in
holy
things
or
to
other
pious
uses

i
after
examining
the
sources
of

the
first
and
most
general
question
that
occurs
is
whether
any
war
is
just
or
if
it
is
ever
lawful
to
make
war
but
this
question
like
many
others
that
follow
must
in
the
first
place
be
compared
with
the
rights
of
nature
cicero
in
the
third
book
of
his
bounds
of
good
and
evil
and
in
other
parts
of
his
works
proves
with
great
erudition
from
the
writings
of
the
stoics
that
there
are
certain
first
principles
of
nature
called
by
the
greeks
the
first
natural
impressions
which
are
succeeded
by
other
principles
of
obligation
superior
even
to
the
first
impressions
themselves
he
calls
the
care
which
every
animal
from
the
moment
of
its
birth
feels
for
itself
and
the
preservation
of
its
condition
its
abhorrence
of
destruction
and
of
every
thing
that
threatens
death
a
principle
of
nature
hence
he
says
it
happens
that
if
left
to
his
own
choice
every
man
would
prefer
a
sound
and
perfect
to
a
mutilated
and
deformed
body
so
that
preserving
ourselves
in
a
natural
state
and
holding
to
every
thing
conformable
and
averting
every
thing
repugnant
to
nature
is
the
first
duty
but
from
the
knowledge
of
these
principles
a
notion
arises
of
their
being
agreeable
to
reason
that
part
of
a
man
which
is
superior
to
the
body
now
that
agreement
with
reason
which
is
the
basis
of
propriety
should
have
more
weight
than
the
impulse
of
appetite
because
the
principles
of
nature
recommend
right
reason
as
a
rule
that
ought
to
be
of
higher
value
than
bare
instinct
as
the
truth
of
this
is
easily
assented
to
by
all
men
of
sound
judgment
without
any
other
demonstration
it
follows
that
in
inquiring
into
the
laws
of
nature
the
first
object
of
consideration
is
what
is
agreeable
to
those
principles
of
nature
and
then
we
come
to
the
rules
which
though
arising
only
out
of
the
former
are
of
higher
dignity
and
not
only
to
be
embraced
when
offered
but
pursued
by
all
the
means
in
our
power
this
last
principle
which
is
called
propriety
from
its
fitness
according
to
the
various
things
on
which
it
turns
sometimes
is
limited
to
a
very
narrow
point
the
least
departure
from
which
is
a
deviation
into
vice
sometimes
it
allows
a
wider
scope
so
that
some
actions
even
laudable
in
themselves
may
be
omitted
or
varied
without
crime
in
this
case
there
is
not
an
immediate
distinction
between
right
and
wrong
the
shades
are
gradual
and
their
termination
unperceived
not
like
a
direct
contrast
where
the
opposition
is
immediately
seen
and
the
first
step
is
a
transgression
of
the
fixed
bounds
the
general
object
of
divine
and
human
laws
is
to
give
the
authority
of
obligation
to
what
was
only
laudable
in
itself
it
has
been
said
above
that
an
investigation
of
the
laws
of
nature
implies
an
inquiry
whether
any
particular
action
may
be
done
without
injustice
now
by
an
act
of
injustice
is
understood
that
which
necessarily
has
in
it
any
thing
repugnant
to
the
nature
of
a
reasonable
and
social
being
so
far
from
any
thing
in
the
principles
of
nature
being
repugnant
to
war
every
part
of
them
indeed
rather
favours
it
for
the
preservation
of
our
lives
and
persons
which
is
the
end
of
war
and
the
possession
or
acquirement
of
things
necessary
and
useful
to
life
is
most
suitable
to
those
principles
of
nature
and
to
use
force
if
necessary
for
those
occasions
is
no
way
dissonant
to
the
principles
of
nature
since
all
animals
are
endowed
with
natural
strength
sufficient
to
assist
and
defend
themselves
xenophon
says
that
every
animal
knows
a
certain
method
of
fighting
without
any
other
instructor
than
nature
in
a
fragment
of
ovid
called
the
art
of
fishery
it
is
remarked
that
all
animals
know
their
enemy
and
his
means
of
defence
and
the
strength
and
measure
of
their
own
weapons
horace
has
said
the
wolf
attacks
with
its
teeth
the
bull
with
its
horns
and
whence
is
this
knowledge
derived
but
from
instinct
on
this
subject
lucretius
enlarges
observing
that
every
creature
knows
its
own
powers
the
calf
butts
with
its
forehead
before
its
horns
appear
and
strikes
with
all
imaginable
fury
on
which
galen
expresses
himself
in
the
following
manner
every
animal
appears
to
defend
itself
with
that
part
of
its
body
in
which
it
excels
others
the
calf
butts
with
its
head
before
its
horns
have
grown
and
the
colt
strikes
with
its
heel
before
its
hoofs
are
hard
as
the
young
dog
attempts
to
bite
before
his
teeth
are
strong
the
same
writer
in
describing
the
use
of
different
parts
of
the
body
says
that
man
is
a
creature
formed
for
peace
and
war
his
armour
forms
not
an
immediate
part
of
his
body
but
he
has
hands
fit
for
preparing
and
handling
arms
and
we
see
infants
using
them
spontaneously
without
being
taught
to
do
so
aristotle
in
the
book
and
tenth
chapter
of
the
history
of
animals
says
that
the
hand
serves
man
for
a
spear
a
sword
or
any
arms
whatever
because
it
can
hold
and
wield
them
now
right
reason
and
the
nature
of
society
which
claims
the
second
and
indeed
more
important
place
in
this
inquiry
prohibit
not
all
force
but
only
that
which
is
repugnant
to
society
by
depriving
another
of
his
right
for
the
end
of
society
is
to
form
a
common
and
united
aid
to
preserve
to
every
one
his
own
which
may
easily
be
understood
to
have
obtained
before
what
is
now
called
property
was
introduced
for
the
free
use
of
life
and
limbs
was
so
much
the
right
of
every
one
that
it
could
not
be
infringed
or
attacked
without
injustice
so
the
use
of
the
common
productions
of
nature
was
the
right
of
the
first
occupier
and
for
any
one
to
rob
him
of
that
was
manifest
injustice
this
may
be
more
easily
understood
since
law
and
custom
have
established
property
under
its
present
form
tully
has
expressed
this
in
the
third
book
of
his
offices
in
the
following
words
if
every
member
could
have
separate
feeling
and
imagine
it
could
derive
vigour
from
engrossing
the
strength
of
a
neighboring
part
of
the
body
the
whole
frame
would
languish
and
perish
in
the
same
manner
if
every
one
of
us
for
his
own
advantage
might
rob
another
of
what
he
pleased
there
would
be
a
total
overthrow
of
human
society
and
intercourse
for
though
it
is
allowed
by
nature
for
every
one
to
give
the
preference
to
himself
before
another
in
the
enjoyment
of
life
and
necessaries
yet
she
does
not
permit
us
to
increase
our
means
and
riches
by
the
spoils
of
others
it
is
not
therefore
contrary
to
the
nature
of
society
to
provide
and
consult
for
ourselves
if
another
right
is
not
injured
the
force
therefore
which
inviolably
abstains
from
touching
the
rights
of
others
is
not
unjust
for
as
the
same
cicero
observes
some
where
in
his
epistles
that
as
there
are
two
modes
of
contending
the
one
by
argument
and
the
other
by
force
and
as
the
former
is
peculiar
to
man
and
the
latter
common
to
him
with
the
brute
creation
we
must
have
recourse
to
the
latter
when
it
is
impossible
to
use
the
former
and
again
what
can
be
opposed
to
force
but
force
ulpian
observes
that
cassius
says
it
is
lawful
to
repel
force
by
force
and
it
is
a
right
apparently
provided
by
nature
to
repel
arms
with
arms
with
whom
ovid
agrees
observing
that
the
laws
permit
us
to
take
up
arms
against
those
that
bear
them
ii
the
observation
that
all
war
is
not
repugnant
to
the
law
of
nature
may
be
more
amply
proved
from
sacred
history
for
when
abraham
with
his
servants
and
confederates
had
gained
a
victory
by
force
of
arms
over
the
four
kings
who
had
plundered
sodom
god
approved
of
his
act
by
the
mouth
of
his
priest
melchisedech
who
said
to
him
blessed
be
the
most
high
god
who
hath
delivered
thine
enemies
into
thine
hand
xiv
now
abraham
had
taken
up
arms
as
appears
from
the
history
without
any
special
command
from
god
but
this
man
no
less
eminent
for
sanctity
than
wisdom
felt
himself
authorized
by
the
law
of
nature
as
it
is
admitted
by
the
evidence
of
berosus
and
orpheus
who
were
strangers
there
is
no
occasion
to
appeal
to
the
history
of
the
seven
nations
whom
god
delivered
up
into
the
hands
of
the
israelites
to
be
destroyed
for
there
was
a
special
command
to
execute
the
judgment
of
god
upon
nations
guilty
of
the
greatest
crimes
from
whence
these
wars
are
literally
styled
in
scripture
battles
of
the
lord
as
undertaken
not
by
human
will
but
by
divine
appointment
the
xvii
chapter
of
exodus
supplies
a
passage
more
to
the
purpose
relating
the
overthrow
which
the
israelites
conducted
by
moses
and
joshua
made
of
the
amalekites
in
this
act
there
was
no
express
commission
from
god
but
only
an
approval
after
it
was
done
but
in
the
xix
chap
of
deut
ver
god
has
prescribed
general
and
standing
laws
to
his
people
on
the
manner
of
making
war
by
this
circumstance
shewing
that
a
war
may
be
just
without
any
express
commandment
from
him
because
in
the
same
passage
a
plain
distinction
is
made
between
the
case
of
the
seven
nations
and
that
of
others
and
as
there
is
no
special
edict
prescribing
the
just
causes
for
which
war
may
be
undertaken
the
determination
of
them
is
left
to
the
discovery
of
natural
reason
of
this
kind
is
the
war
of
jephthah
against
the
ammonites
in
defence
of
their
borders
jud

and
the
war
of
david
against
the

people

having
violated

rights

to
the
preceding
observations
may
be
added
what
the
inspired
writer
of

hebrews
says
of
gideon
barack
sampson
jephthah
david

the
whole
tenor
of
this
passage
shews
that
the
word
faith
implies
a
persuasion
that
what
they
did
was
believed
to
be
agreeable
to
the
will
of
god
in
the
same
manner
david
is
said
by
a
woman
distinguished
for
her
wisdom
sam
xxv
to
fight
the
battles
of
the
lord
that
is
to
make
lawful
and
just
wars
iii
proofs
of
what
has
been
advanced
may
be
drawn
also
from
the
consent
of
all
especially
of
the
wisest
nations
there
is
a
celebrated
passage
in
cicero
speech
for
milo
in
which
justifying
recourse
to
force
in
defence
of
life
he
bears
ample
testimony
to
the
feelings
of
nature
who
has
given
us
this
law
which
is
not
written
but
innate
which
we
have
not
received
by
instruction
hearing
or
reading
but
the
elements
of
it
have
been
engraven
in
our
hearts
and
minds
with
her
own
hand
a
law
which
is
not
the
effect
of
habit
and
acquirement
but
forms
a
part
in
the
original
complexion
of
our
frame
so
that
if
our
lives
are
threatened
with
assassination
or
open
violence
from
the
hands
of
robbers
or
enemies
any
means
of
defence
would
be
allowed
and
laudable
he
proceeds
reason
has
taught
this
to
the
learned
necessity
to
the
barbarians
custom
to
nations
and
nature
herself
to
wild
beasts
to
use
every
possible
means
of
repelling
force
offered
to
their
bodies
their
limbs
and
their
lives
caius
and
lawyer
says
natural
reason
permits
us
to
defend
ourselves
against
dangers
and
florentinus
another
legal
authority
maintains
that
whatever
any
one
does
in
defence
of
his
person
ought
to
be
esteemed
right
josephus
observes
that
the
love
of
life
is
a
law
of
nature
strongly
implanted
in
all
creatures
and
therefore
we
look
upon
those
as
enemies
who
would
openly
deprive
us
of
it
this
principle
is
founded
on
reasons
of
equity
so
evident
that
even
in
the
brute
creation
who
have
no
idea
of
right
we
make
a
distinction
between
attack
and
defence
for
when
ulpian
had
said
that
an
animal
without
knowledge
that
is
without
the
use
of
reason
could
not
possibly
do
wrong
he
immediately
adds
that
when
two
animals
fight
if
one
kills
the
other
the
distinction
of
quintius
mutius
must
be
admitted
that
if
the
aggressor
were
killed
no
damages
could
be
recovered
but
if
the
other
which
was
attacked
an
action
might
be
maintained
there
is
a
passage
in
pliny
which
will
serve
for
an
explanation
of
this
he
says
that
the
fiercest
lions
do
not
fight
with
each
other
nor
do
serpents
bite
serpents
but
if
any
violence
is
done
to
the
tamest
of
them
they
are
roused
and
upon
receiving
any
hurt
will
defend
themselves
with
the
greatest
alacrity
and
vigour
iv
from
the
law
of
nature
then
which
may
also
be
called
the
law
of
nations
it
is
evident
that
all
kinds
of
war
are
not
to
be
condemned
in
the
same
manner
all
history
and
the
laws
of
manners
of
every
people
sufficiently
inform
us
that
war
is
not
condemned
by
the
voluntary
law
of
nations
indeed
hermogenianus
has
said
that
wars
were
introduced
by
the
law
of
nations
a
passage
which
ought
to
be
explained
somewhat
differently
from
the
general
interpretation
given
to
it
the
meaning
of
it
is
that
certain
formalities
attending
war
were
introduced
by
the
law
of
nations
which
formalities
were
necessary
to
secure
the
peculiar
privileges
arising
out
of
the
law
from
hence
a
distinction
which
there
will
be
occasion
to
use
hereafter
between
a
war
with
the
usual
formalities
of
the
law
of
nations
which
is
called
just
or
perfect
and
an
informal
war
which
does
not
for
that
reason
cease
to
be
just
or
agreeable
to
right
for
some
wars
when
made
upon
just
grounds
though
not
exactly
conformable
yet
are
not
repugnant
to
the
law
as
will
be
explained
more
fully
hereafter
by
the
law
of
the
nations
says
livy
provision
is
made
to
repel
force
by
arms
and
florentinus
declares
that
the
law
of
nations
allows
us
to
repel
violence
and
injury
in
order
to
protect
our
persons
a
greater
difficulty
occurs
respecting
the
divine
voluntary
law
nor
is
there
any
force
in
the
objection
that
as
the
law
of
nature
is
unchangeable
nothing
can
be
appointed
even
by
god
himself
contrary
to
it
for
this
is
true
only
in
those
things
which
the
law
of
nature
positively
forbids
or
commands
not
in
those
which
are
tacitly
permitted
by
the
same
law
for
acts
of
that
kind
not
falling
strictly
within
the
general
rule
but
being
exceptions
to
the
law
of
nature
may
be
either
forbidden
or
commanded
the
first
objection
usually
made
against
the
lawfulness
of
war
is
taken
from
the
law
given
to
noah
and
his
posterity
ix
where
god
thus
speaks
surely
the
blood
of
your
lives
will
i
require
at
the
hand
of
every
beast
will
i
require
it
and
at
the
hand
of
every
man
at
the
hand
of
every
brother
will
i
require
the
life
of
man
whoever
sheds
man
blood
by
man
shall
his
blood
be
shed
for
in
the
image
of
god
made
he
man
here
some
take
the
phrase
of
requiring
blood
in
the
most
general
sense
and
the
other
part
that
blood
shall
be
shed
in
its
turn
they
consider
as
a
bare
threat
and
not
an
approbation
neither
of
which
acceptations
can
be
admitted
for
the
prohibition
of
shedding
blood
extends
not
beyond
the
law
itself
which
declares
thou
shalt
not
kill
but
passes
no
condemnation
upon
capital
punishments
or
wars
undertaken
by
public
authority
neither
the
law
of
moses
nor
that
given
to
noah
established
any
thing
new
they
were
only
a
declaratory
repetition
of
the
law
of
nature
that
had
been
obliterated
by
depraved
custom
so
that
the
shedding
of
blood
in
a
criminal
and
wanton
manner
is
the
only
act
prohibited
by
those
commandments
thus
every
act
of
homicide
does
not
amount
to
murder
but
only
that
which
is
committed
with
a
wilful
and
malicious
intention
to
destroy
the
life
of
an
innocent
person
as
to
what
follows
about
blood
being
shed
in
return
for
blood
it
seems
to
imply
not
a
mere
act
of
personal
revenge
but
the
deliberate
exercise
of
a
perfect
right
which
may
be
thus
explained
it
is
not
unjust
according
to
the
principles
of
nature
that
any
one
should
suffer
in
proportion
to
the
evil
he
has
done
conformably
to
the
judicial
maxim
of
rhadamanthus
that
if
any
one
himself
suffers
what
he
has
done
it
is
but
just
and
right
the
same
opinion
is
thus
expressed
by
seneca
the
father
it
is
but
a
just
retaliation
for
any
one
to
suffer
in
his
own
person
the
evil
which
he
intended
to
inflict
upon
another
from
a
sense
of
this
natural
justice
cain
knowing
himself
guilty
of
his
brother
blood
said
whosoever
finds
me
shall
kill
me
but
as
in
those
early
times
when
men
were
few
and
aggressions
rare
there
was
less
occasion
for
examples
god
restrained
by
an
express
commandment
the
impulse
of
nature
which
appeared
lawful
he
forbad
any
one
to
kill
the
murderer
at
the
same
time
prohibiting
all
intercourse
with
him
even
so
far
as
not
to
touch
him
plato
has
established
this
in
his
laws
and
the
same
rule
prevailed
in
greece
as
appears
from
the
following
passage
in
euripides
our
fathers
of
old
did
well
in
banishing
from
their
intercourse
and
sight
any
one
that
had
shed
another
blood
imposing
banishment
by
way
of
atonement
rather
than
inflicting
death
we
find
thucydides
of
the
same
opinion
that
anciently
lighter
punishments
were
inflicted
for
the
greatest
crimes
but
in
process
of
time
as
those
penalties
came
to
be
despised
legislators
were
obliged
to
have
recourse
to
death
in
certain
cases
we
may
add
to
the
above
instances
the
remark
of
lactantius
that
as
yet
it
appeared
a
sin
to
punish
even
the
most
wicked
men
with
death
the
conjecture
of
the
divine
will
taken
from
the
remarkable
instance
of
cain
whom
no
one
was
permitted
to
kill
passed
into
a
law
so
that
lanech
having
perpetrated
a
similar
deed
promised
himself
impunity
from
this
gen
iv
but
as
before
the
deluge
in
the
time
of
the
giants
the
practice
of
frequent
and
wanton
murders
had
prevailed
upon
the
renewal
of
the
human
race
after
the
deluge
that
the
same
evil
custom
might
not
be
established
god
thought
proper
to
restrain
it
by
severer
means
the
lenity
of
former
ages
was
laid
aside
and
the
divine
authority
gave
a
sanction
to
the
precepts
of
natural
justice
that
whoever
killed
a
murderer
should
be
innocent
after
tribunals
were
erected
the
power
over
life
was
for
the
very
best
reasons
conferred
upon
the
judges
alone
still
some
traces
of
ancient
manners
remained
in
the
right
which
was
granted
after
the
introduction
of
the
mosaic
law
to
the
nearest
in
blood
to
the
person
killed
this
interpretation
is
justified
by
the
authority
of
abraham
who
with
a
perfect
knowledge
of
the
law
given
to
noah
took
arms
against
the
four
kings
fully
persuaded
that
he
was
doing
nothing
in
violation
of
that
law
in
the
same
manner
moses
ordered
the
people
to
fight
against
amalekites
who
attacked
them
following
in
this
case
the
dictates
of
nature
for
he
appears
to
have
had
no
special
communication
with
god
exod
xvii
besides
we
find
that
capital
punishments
were
inflicted
upon
other
criminals
as
well
as
murderers
not
only
among
the
gentiles
but
among
those
who
had
been
impressed
with
the
most
pious
rules
and
opinions
even
the
patriarchs
themselves
xxxviii
indeed
upon
comparing
the
divine
will
with
the
light
of
nature
it
was
concluded
that
it
seemed
conformable
to
justice
that
other
crimes
of
great
enormity
should
be
subject
to
the
same
punishment
as
that
of
murder
for
there
are
some
rights
such
as
those
of
reputation
chastity
conjugal
fidelity
submission
of
subjects
to
their
princes
all
of
which
are
esteemed
of
equal
value
with
life
itself
because
on
the
preservation
of
these
the
peace
and
comfort
of
life
depend
the
violation
of
any
of
those
rights
is
little
less
than
murder
itself
here
may
be
applied
the
old
tradition
found
among
the
jews
that
there
were
many
laws
which
were
not
all
mentioned
by
moses
given
by
god
to
the
sons
of
noah
as
it
was
sufficient
for
his
purpose
that
they
should
afterwards
be
comprehended
in
the
peculiar
laws
of
the
hebrews
thus
it
appears
from
xviii
chap
of
leviticus
that
there
was
an
ancient
law
against
incestuous
marriages
though
not
mentioned
by
moses
in
its
proper
place
now
among
the
commandments
given
by
god
to
the
children
of
noah
it
is
said
that
death
was
expressly
declared
to
be
the
punishment
not
only
for
murder
but
for
adultery
incest
and
robbery
which
is
confirmed
by
the
words
of
job
xxxi
the
law
of
moses
too
for
the
sanction
of
capital
punishments
gives
reasons
which
operate
no
less
with
other
nations
than
with
the
jewish
people
levit
xviii
psa
ci
prov
xx
and
particularly
respecting
murder
it
is
said
the
land
can
not
be
cleansed
unless
the
blood
of
the
murderer
be
shed
numb
xxv
besides
it
were
absurd
to
suppose
that
the
jewish
people
were
indulged
with
the
privilege
of
maintaining
the
public
safety
and
that
of
individuals
by
capital
punishments
and
asserting
their
rights
by
war
and
that
other
kings
and
nations
were
not
allowed
the
same
powers
nor
do
we
find
that
those
kings
or
nations
were
forewarned
by
the
prophets
that
the
use
of
capital
punishments
and
that
all
wars
were
condemned
by
god
in
the
same
manner
as
they
were
admonished
of
all
other
sins
on
the
other
hand
can
any
one
doubt
as
the
law
of
moses
bore
such
an
express
image
of
the
divine
will
respecting
criminal
justice
whether
other
nations
would
not
have
acted
wisely
in
adopting
it
for
their
example
it
is
certain
that
the
greeks
and
the
athenians
in
particular
did
so
from
hence
came
the
close
resemblance
which
the
jewish
bore
to
the
old
athenian
law
and
to
that
of
the
twelve
tables
of
rome
enough
has
been
said
to
shew
that
the
law
given
to
noah
can
not
bear
the
interpretation
of
those
who
derive
from
it
their
arguments
against
the
lawfulness
of
all
war
vi
the
arguments
against
the
lawfulness
of
war
drawn
from
the
gospel
are
more
specious
in
examining
which
it
will
not
be
necessary
to
assume
as
many
do
that
the
gospel
contains
nothing
more
than
the
law
of
nature
except
the
rules
of
faith
and
the
sacraments
an
assumption
which
in
its
general
acceptation
is
by
no
means
true
it
may
readily
be
admitted
that
nothing
inconsistent
with
natural
justice
is
enjoined
in
the
gospel
yet
it
can
never
be
allowed
that
the
laws
of
christ
do
not
impose
duties
upon
us
above
those
required
by
the
law
of
nature
and
those
who
think
otherwise
strain
their
arguments
to
prove
that
many
practices
forbidden
by
the
gospel
as
concubinage
divorce
polygamy
were
made
offences
by
the
law
of
nature
the
light
of
nature
might
point
out
the
honour
of
abstaining
from
such
practices
but
the
sinfulness
of
them
could
not
have
been
discovered
without
a
revelation
of
the
will
of
god
who
for
instance
would
say
that
the
christian
precept
of
laying
down
our
lives
for
others
was
an
obligation
of
the
law
of
nature
john
iii
it
is
said
by
justin
the
martyr
that
to
live
according
to
the
bare
law
of
nature
is
not
the
character
of
a
true
believer
neither
can
we
follow
those
who
adopting
another
meaning
of
no
inconsiderable
import
construe
the
precept
delivered
by
christ
in
his
sermon
on
the
mount
into
nothing
more
than
an
interpretation
of
the
mosaic
law
for
the
words
you
have
heard
it
was
said
to
them
of
old
but
i
say
to
you
which
are
so
often
repeated
imply
something
else
those
of
old
were
no
other
than
contemporaries
of
moses
for
what
is
there
repeated
as
said
to
those
of
old
are
not
the
words
of
the
teachers
of
the
law
but
of
moses
either
literally
or
in
their
meaning
they
are
cited
by
our

his
express

as

but
to
understand
the
words
of
our
saviour
we
must
observe
that
the
law
of
moses
is
taken
in
a
double
sense
either
as
containing
some
principles
in
common
with
human
laws
such
as
imposing
restraint
upon
human
crimes
by
the
dread
of
exemplary
punishments

and
in
this
manner
maintaining
civil
society
among
the
jewish
people
for
which
reason
it
is
called
heb

the
law
of
a
carnal
commandment
and
rom
iii
the
law
of
works
or
it
may
be
taken
in
another
sense
comprehending
the
peculiar
sanctions
of
a
divine
law
requiring
purity
of
mind
and
certain
actions
which
might
be
omitted
without
temporal
punishments
in
this
sense
it
is
called
a
spiritual
law
giving
life
to
the
soul
the
teachers
of
the
law
and
the
pharisees
considering
the
first
part
as
sufficient
neglected
to
instruct
the
people
in
the
second
and
more
important
branch
deeming
it
superfluous
the
truth
of
this
may
be
proved
not
only
from
our
own
writings
but
from
josephus
also
and
the
jewish
rabbis
respecting
this
second
part
we
may
observe
that
the
virtues
which
are
required
of
christians
are
either
recommended
or
enjoined
to
the
hebrews
but
not
enjoined
in
the
same
degree
and
extent
as
to
christians
now
in
both
these
senses
christ
opposes
his
own
precepts
to
the
old
law
from
whence
it
is
clear
that
his
words
contain
more
than
a
bare
interpretation
of
the
mosaic
law
these
observations
apply
not
only
to
the
question
immediately
in
hand
but
to
many
others
that
we
may
not
rest
upon
the
authority
of
the
mosaic
law
farther
than
is
right
vii
omitting
therefore
the
less
satisfactory
proofs
as
a
leading
point
of
evidence
to
shew
that
the
right
of
war
is
not
taken
away
by
the
law
of
the
gospel
that
passage
in
paul
epistle
to
timothy
may
be
referred
to
where
the
apostle
says
i
exhort
therefore
that
first
of
all
supplications
prayers
intercessions
and
giving
of
thanks
be
made
for
all
men
for
kings
and
for
all
that
are
in
authority
that
we
may
lead
a
quiet
and
peaceable
life
in
all
godliness
and
honesty
for
this
is
good
and
acceptable
in
the
sight
of
god
our
saviour
who
would
have
all
men
to
be
saved
and
to
come
to
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
eph
ii
from
this
passage
the
following
conclusions
may
be
drawn
in
the
first
place
that
christian
piety
in
kings
is
acceptable
to
god
that
their
profession
of
christianity
does
not
abridge
their
rights
of
sovereignty
justin
the
martyr
has
said
that
in
our
prayers
for
kings
we
should
beg
that
they
may
unite
a
spirit
of
wisdom
with
their
royal
power
and
in
the
book
called
the
constitutions
of
clement
the
church
prays
for
christian
rulers
and
that
christian
princes
may
perform
an
acceptable
service
to
god
by
securing
to
other
christians
the
enjoyment
of
quiet
lives
the
manner
in
which
the
sovereign
secures
this
important
end
is
explained
in
another
passage
from
the
same
apostle
rom
xiii
he
is
the
minister
of
god
to
thee
for
good
but
if
thou
do
evil
fear
for
he
beareth
not
the
sword
in
vain
for
he
is
the
minister
of
god
an
avenger
to
execute
wrath
upon
them
that
do
evil
by
the
right
of
the
sword
is
understood
the
exercise
of
every
kind
of
restraint
in
the
sense
adopted
by
the
lawyers
not
only
over
offenders
amongst
his
own
people
but
against
neighboring
nations
who
violate
his
own
and
his
people
rights
to
clear
up
this
point
we
may
refer
to
the
second
psalm
which
although
it
applies
literally
to
david
yet
in
its
more
full
and
perfect
sense
relates
to
christ
which
may
be
seen
by
consulting
other
parts
of
scripture
for
instance
acts
iv
xiii
for
that
psalm
exhorts
all
kings
to
worship
the
son
of
god
shewing
themselves
as
kings
to
be
his
ministers
which
may
be
explained
by
the
words
of
augustine
who
says
in
this
kings
in
their
royal
capacity
serve
god
according
to
the
divine
commandment
if
they
promote
what
is
good
and
prohibit
what
is
evil
in
their
kingdoms
not
only
relating
to
human
society
but
also
respecting
religion
and
in
another
place
the
same
writer
says
how
can
kings
serve
the
lord
in
fear
unless
they
can
prohibit
and
punish
with
due
severity
offences
against
the
law
of
god
for
the
capacities
in
which
they
serve
god
as
individuals
and
as
kings
are
very
different
in
this
respect
they
serve
the
lord
as
kings
when
they
promote
his
service
by
means
which
they
could
not
use
without
regal
power
the
same
part
of
the
apostle
writings
supplies
us
with
a
second
argument
where
the
higher
powers
meaning
kings
are
said
to
be
from
god
and
are
called
the
ordinance
of
god
from
whence
it
is
plainly
inferred
that
we
are
to
honour
and
obey
the
king
from
motives
of
conscience
and
that
every
one
who
resists
him
is
resisting
god
if
the
word
ordinance
meant
nothing
more
than
a
bare
permission
that
obedience
which
the
apostle
so
strenuously
enjoins
would
only
have
the
force
of
an
imperfect
obligation
but
as
the
word
ordinance
in
the
original
implies
an
express
commandment
and
appointment
and
as
all
parts
of
the
revealed
will
of
god
are
consistent
with
each
other
it
follows
that
the
obedience
of
subjects
to
sovereigns
is
a
duty
of
supreme
obligation
nor
is
the
argument
at
all
weakened
by
its
being
said
that
the
sovereigns
at
the
time
when
paul
wrote
were
not
christians
for
it
is
not
universally
true
as
sergius
paulus
the
deputy
governor
of
cyprus
had
long
before
professed
the
christian
religion
acts
xiii
there
is
no
occasion
to
mention
the
tradition
respecting
abgarus
the
king
of
edessa
epistle
to
our
saviour
a
tradition
mingled
with
falsehood
though
in
some
measure
founded
upon
truth
for
the
question
did
not
turn
upon
the
characters
of
the
princes
whether
they
were
godly
or
not
but
whether
their
holding
the
kingly
office
was
repugnant
to
the
law
of
god
this
paul
denies
maintaining
that
the
kingly
office
even
under
all
circumstances
was
appointed
by
god
therefore
it
ought
to
be
honoured
from
motives
of
conscience
which
properly
speaking
are
under
the
controul
of
god
alone
so
that
nero
and
king
agrippa
whom
paul
so
earnestly
entreats
to
become
a
christian
might
have
embraced
christianity
and
still
retained
the
one
his
regal
and
the
other
his
imperial
authority
which
could
not
be
exercised
without
the
power
of
the
sword
as
the
legal
sacrifices
might
formerly
be
performed
by
wicked
priests
in
the
same
manner
regal
power
would
retain
its
indelible
sanctity
though
in
the
hands
of
an
ungodly
man
a
third
argument
is
derived
from
the
words
of
john
the
baptist
who
at
a
time
when
many
thousands
of
the
jews
served
in
the
roman
armies
as
appears
from
the
testimony
of
josephus
and
others
being
seriously
asked
by
the
soldiers
what
they
should
do
to
avoid
the
wrath
of
god
did
not
command
them
to
renounce
their
military
calling
which
he
ought
to
have
done
had
it
been
inconsistent
with
the
law
and
will
of
god
but
to
abstain
from
violence
extortion
and
false
accusation
and
to
be
content
with
their
wages
in
reply
to
these
words
of
the
baptist
so
plainly
giving
authority
to
the
military
profession
many
observed
that
the
injunction
of
the
baptist
is
so
widely
different
from
the
precepts
of
christ
that
he
seemed
to
preach
one
doctrine
and
our
lord
another
which
is
by
no
means
admissible
for
the
following
reasons
both
our
saviour
and
the
baptist
made
repentance
the
substance
of
their
doctrine
for
the
kingdom
of
heaven
was
at
hand
by
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
meant
a
new
law
as
the
hebrews
used
to
give
the
name
of
kingdom
to
their
law
christ
himself
says
the
kingdom
of
heaven
began
to
suffer
violence
from
the
days
of
john
the
baptist
matt
xi
john
is
said
to
have
preached
the
baptism
of
repentance
for
the
remission
of
sins
mark
i
the
apostles
are
said
to
have
done
the
same
in
the
name
of
christ
acts
xi
john
requires
fruits
worthy
of
repentance
and
threatens
destruction
to
those
who
do
not
produce
them
matt
iii
he
also
requires
works
of
charity
above
the
law
luke
iii
the
law
is
said
to
have
continued
till
john
that
is
a
more
perfect
law
is
said
to
have
commenced
from
his
instruction
he
was
called
greater
than
the
prophets
and
declared
to
be
one
sent
to
give
the
knowledge
of
salvation
to
the
people
by
announcing
the
gospel
he
makes
no
distinction
between
himself
and
jesus
on
the
score
of
doctrine
only
ascribing
to
christ
as
the
promised
messiah
the
lord
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
who
would
give
the
power
of
the
holy
spirit
to
those
who
believed
in
him
in
short
the
dawning
rudiments
of
knowledge
which
proceeded
from
the
forerunner
were
more
distinctly
unfolded
and
cleared
up
by
christ
himself
the
light
of
the
world
there
is
a
fourth
argument
which
seems
to
have
no
little
weight
proceeding
upon
the
supposition
that
if
the
right
of
inflicting
capital
punishments
were
abolished
and
princes
were
deprived
of
the
power
of
the
sword
to
protect
their
subjects
against
the
violence
of
murderers
and
robbers
wickedness
would
triumphantly
prevail
and
the
world
would
be
deluged
with
crimes
which
even
under
the
best
established
governments
are
with
so
much
difficulty
prevented
or
restrained
if
then
it
had
been
the
intention
of
christ
to
introduce
such
an
order
of
things
as
had
never
been
heard
of
he
would
undoubtedly
by
the
most
express
and
particular
words
have
condemned
all
capital
punishments
and
all
wars
which
we
never
read
that
he
did
for
the
arguments
brought
in
favor
of
such
an
opinion
are
for
the
most
part
very
indefinite
and
obscure
now
both
justice
and
common
sense
require
such
general
expressions
to
be
taken
in
a
limited
acceptation
and
allow
us
in
explaining
ambiguous
words
to
depart
from
their
literal
meaning
where
our
strictly
adhering
to
it
would
lead
to
manifest
inconvenience
and
detriment
there
is
a
fifth
argument
maintaining
that
no
proof
can
be
adduced
that
the
judicial
part
of
the
mosaic
law
inflicting
sentence
of
death
ever
ceased
to
be
in
force
till
the
city
of
jerusalem
and
the
civil
polity
of
the
jews
were
utterly
destroyed
without
hopes
of
restoration
for
in
the
mosaic
dispensation
no
assignable
term
is
named
for
the
duration
of
the
law
nor
do
christ
and
his
apostles
ever
speak
of
its
abolition
except
in
allusion
to
the
overthrow
of
the
jewish
state
indeed
on
the
contrary
paul
says
that
the
high
priest
was
appointed
to
judge
according
to
the
law
of
moses
acts
xxiv
and
christ
himself
in
the
introduction
to
his
precepts
declares
that
he
came
not
to
destroy
the
law
but
to
fulfil
it
matt
the
application
of
his
meaning
to
the
ritual
law
is
very
plain
for
it
was
only
the
outline
and
shadow
of
that
perfect
body
of
which
the
gospel
formed
the
substance
but
how
is
it
possible
that
the
judicial
laws
should
stand
if
christ
according
to
the
opinion
of
some
abolished
them
by
his
coming
now
if
the
law
remained
in
force
as
long
as
the
jewish
state
continued
it
follows
that
the
jewish
converts
to
christianity
if
called
to
the
magisterial
office
could
not
refuse
it
on
the
score
of
declining
to
pass
sentence
of
death
and
that
they
could
not
decide
otherwise
than
the
law
of
moses
had
prescribed
upon
weighing
the
whole
matter
the
slightest
ground
can
not
be
discovered
for
supposing
that
any
pious
man
who
had
heard
those
words
from
our
saviour
himself
would
have
understood
them
in
a
sense
different
from
that
which
has
been
here
given
it
must
however
be
admitted
that
before
the
gospel
dispensation
permission
or
impunity
was
granted
to
certain
acts
and
dispositions
which
it
would
neither
be
necessary
nor
proper
to
examine
at
present
upon
which
christ
did
not
allow
his
followers
to
act
of
this
kind
was
the
permission
to
put
away
a
wife
for
every
offence
and
to
seek
redress
by
law
for
every
injury
now
between
the
positive
precepts
of
christ
and
those
permissions
there
is
a
difference
but
not
a
contradiction
for
he
that
retains
his
wife
and
he
that
forgoes
his
right
of
redress
does
nothing
contrary
to
the
law
but
rather
acts
agreeably
to
the
spirit
of
it
it
is
very
different
with
a
judge
who
is
not
merely
permitted
but
commanded
by
the
law
to
punish
a
murderer
with
death
incurring
guilt
in
the
sight
of
god
if
he
should
act
otherwise
if
christ
had
forbidden
him
to
put
a
murderer
to
death
his
prohibition
would
have
amounted
to
a
contradiction
and
it
would
have
abolished
the
law
the
example
of
cornelius
the
centurion
supplies
a
sixth
argument
in
favor
of
this
opinion
in
receiving
the
holy
spirit
from
christ
he
received
an
indubitable
proof
of
his
justification
he
was
baptized
into
the
name
of
christ
by
peter
yet
we
do
not
find
that
he
either
had
resigned
or
was
advised
by
the
apostle
to
resign
his
military
commission
in
reply
to
which
some
maintain
that
when
instructed
by
peter
in
the
nature
of
the
christian
religion
he
must
have
been
instructed
to
form
the
resolution
of
quitting
his
military
calling
there
would
be
some
weight
in
their
answer
if
it
could
be
shown
that
an
absolute
prohibition
of
war
is
to
be
found
among
the
precepts
of
christ
and
as
it
can
be
found
nowhere
else
it
would
have
been
inserted
in
its
proper
place
among
the
precepts
of
christ
that
after
ages
might
not
have
been
ignorant
of
the
rules
of
duty
nor
as
may
be
seen
in
the
xix
chap
of
the
acts
of
the
apostles
and
the
ver
is
it
usual
with
luke
in
cases
where
the
personal
character
and
situation
of
converts
required
an
extraordinary
change
of
life
and
disposition
to
pass
over
such
a
circumstance
without
notice
the
seventh
argument
is
like
the
preceding
and
is
taken
from
the
example
of
sergius
paulus
which
has
been
already
mentioned
in
the
history
of
his
conversion
there
is
not
the
least
intimation
of
his
abdicating
the
magistracy
or
being
required
to
do
so
therefore
silence
respecting
a
circumstance
which
would
naturally
and
necessarily
have
been
mentioned
may
be
fairly
taken
as
a
proof
that
it
never
existed
the
conduct
of
paul
supplies
us
with
an
eighth
argument
on
this
subject
when
he
understood
that
the
jews
lay
in
wait
for
an
opportunity
to
seize
and
kill
him
he
immediately
gave
information
of
their
design
to
the
commander
of
the
roman
garrison
and
when
the
commander
gave
him
a
guard
of
soldiers
to
protect
him
on
his
journey
he
made
no
remonstrance
nor
ever
hinted
either
to
the
commander
or
the
soldiers
that
it
was
displeasing
to
god
to
repel
force
by
force
yet
this
is
the
same
apostle
who
as
appears
from
all
his
writings
tim
iv
neither
himself
neglected
nor
allowed
others
to
neglect
any
opportunity
of
reminding
men
of
their
duty
in
addition
to
all
that
has
been
said
it
may
be
observed
that
the
peculiar
end
of
what
is
lawful
and
binding
must
itself
be
lawful
and
binding
also
it
is
lawful
to
pay
tribute
and
according
to
paul
explanation
it
is
an
act
binding
upon
the
conscience
rom
xiii
for
the
end
of
tribute
is
to
supply
the
state
with
the
means
of
protecting
the
good
and
restraining
the
wicked
there
is
a
passage
in
tacitus
very
applicable
to
the
present
question
it
is
in
the
fourth
book
of
his
history
in
the
speech
of
petilius
cerealis
who
says
the
peace
of
nations
can
not
be
preserved
without
armies
nor
can
armies
be
maintained
without
pay
nor
pay
supplied
without
taxation
there
is
a
sentiment
similar
to
this
of
the
historian
in
augustin
he
says
for
this
purpose
we
pay
tribute
that
the
soldier
may
be
provided
with
the
necessaries
of
life
the
tenth
argument
is
taken
from
that
part
of
the
xxv
chap
of
the
acts
of
the
apostles
where
paul
says
if
i
have
wronged
any
man
or
done
any
thing
worthy
of
death
i
refuse
not
to
die
from
whence
the
opinion
of
paul
may
be
gathered
that
even
after
the
publication
of
the
gospel
there
were
certain
crimes
which
justice
not
only
allowed
but
required
to
be
punished
with
death
which
opinion
peter
also
maintains
but
if
it
had
been
the
will
of
god
that
capital
punishments
should
be
abolished
paul
might
have
cleared
himself
but
he
ought
not
to
have
left
an
impression
on
the
minds
of
men
that
it
was
at
that
time
equally
lawful
as
before
to
punish
the
guilty
with
death
now
as
it
has
been
proved
that
the
coming
of
christ
did
not
take
away
the
right
of
inflicting
capital
punishments
it
has
at
the
same
time
been
proved
that
war
may
be
made
upon
a
multitude
of
armed
offenders
who
can
only
be
brought
to
justice
by
defeat
in
battle
the
numbers
the
strength
and
boldness
of
the
aggressors
though
they
may
have
their
weight
in
restraining
our
deliberations
can
not
in
the
least
diminish
our
right
the
substance
of
the
eleventh
argument
rests
not
only
upon
our
saviour
having
abolished
those
parts
of
the
mosaic
law
which
formed
a
wall
of
separation
between
the
jews
and
other
nations
but
upon
his
allowing
the
moral
parts
to
remain
as
standing
rules
approved
by
the
law
of
nature
and
the
consent
of
every
civilized
people
and
containing
whatever
is
good
and
virtuous
now
the
punishing
of
crimes
and
the
taking
up
arms
to
avenge
or
ward
off
injuries
are
among
those
actions
which
by
the
law
of
nature
rank
as
laudable
and
are
referred
to
the
virtues
of
justice
and
beneficence
and
here
is
the
proper
place
to
animadvert
slightly
upon
the
mistake
of
those
who
derive
the
rights
of
war
possessed
by
the
israelites
solely
from
the
circumstance
of
god
having
given
them
the
land
of
canaan
and
commissioned
them
to
drive
out
the
inhabitants
this
may
be
one
just
reason
but
it
is
not
the
sole
reason
for
prior
to
those
times
holy
men
guided
by
the
light
of
nature
undertook
wars
which
the
israelites
themselves
afterwards
did
for
various
reasons
and
david
in
particular
to
avenge
the
violated
rights
of
ambassadors
but
the
rights
which
any
one
derives
from
the
law
of
nature
are
no
less
his
own
than
if
god
had
given
them
nor
are
those
rights
abolished
by
the
law
of
the
gospel
viii
let
us
now
consider
the
arguments
by
which
the
contrary
opinion
is
supported
that
the
pious
reader
may
judge
more
easily
to
which
side
the
scale
inclines
in
the
first
place
the
prophecy
of
isaiah
is
generally
alleged
who
says
the
time
shall
come
when
nations
shall
beat
their
swords
into
and
turn
their
spears
into
pruning
hooks
nation
shall
not
lift
up
sword
against
nation
neither
shall
they
learn
war
any
more
ii
but
this
prophecy
like
many
others
is
to
be
taken
conditionally
alluding
to
the
state
of
the
world
that
would
take
place
if
all
nations
would
submit
to
the
law
of
christ
and
make
it
the
rule
of
life
to
which
purpose
god
would
suffer
nothing
to
be
wanting
on
his
part
for
it
is
certain
that
if
all
people
were
christians
and
lived
like
christians
there
would
be
no
wars
which
arnobius
expresses
thus
if
all
men
knowing
that
it
is
not
their
corporeal
form
alone
which
makes
them
men
but
the
powers
of
the
understanding
would
lend
a
patient
ear
to
his
salutary
and
pacific
instructions
if
they
would
trust
to
his
admonitions
rather
than
to
the
swelling
pride
and
turbulence
of
their
senses
iron
would
be
employed
for
instruments
of
more
harmless
and
useful
operations
the
world
enjoy
the
softest
repose
and
be
united
in
the
bands
of
inviolable
treaties
on
this
subject
lactantius
reproaching
the
pagans
with
the
deification
of
their
conquerors
says
what
would
be
the
consequence
if
all
men
would
unite
in
concord
which
might
certainly
be
brought
to
pass
if
abandoning
ruinous
and
impious
rage
they
would
live
in
justice
and
innocence
or
this
passage
of
the
prophecy
must
be
understood
literally
and
if
taken
in
that
sense
it
shews
that
it
is
not
yet
fulfilled
but
its
accomplishment
must
be
looked
for
in
the
general
conversion
of
the
jewish
people
but
which
ever
way
you
take
it
no
conclusion
can
be
drawn
from
it
against
the
justice
of
war
as
long
as
violent
men
exist
to
disturb
the
quiet
of
the
lovers
of
peace
ix
in
examining
the
meaning
of
written
evidence
general
custom
and
the
opinions
of
men
celebrated
for
their
wisdom
have
usually
great
weight
a
practice
which
it
is
right
to
observe
in
the
interpretation
of
holy
scripture
for
it
is
not
likely
that
churches
which
had
been
founded
by
the
apostles
would
either
suddenly
or
universally
have
swerved
from
those
opinions
which
the
apostles
had
briefly
expressed
in
writing
and
afterwards
more
fully
and
clearly
explained
to
them
with
their
own
lips
and
reduced
to
practice
now
certain
expressions
of
the
primitive
christians
are
usually
alleged
by
those
who
are
adverse
to
all
wars
whose
opinions
may
be
considered
and
refuted
in
three
points
of
view
in
the
first
place
from
these
expressions
nothing
more
can
be
gathered
than
the
private
opinions
of
certain
individuals
but
no
public
opinion
of
the
churches
besides
these
expressions
for
the
most
part
are
to
be
found
only
in
the
writings
of
origen
tertullian
and
some
few
others
who
wished
to
distinguish
themselves
by
the
brilliancy
of
their
thoughts
without
regarding
consistency
in
their
opinions
for
this
same
origen
says
that
bees
were
given
by
god
as
a
pattern
for
men
to
follow
in
conducting
just
regular
and
necessary
wars
and
likewise
tertullian
who
in
some
parts
seems
to
disapprove
of
capital
punishments
has
said
no
one
can
deny
that
it
is
good
the
guilty
should
be
punished
he
expresses
his
doubts
respecting
the
military
profession
for
in
his
book
upon
idolatry
he
says
it
is
a
fit
matter
of
inquiry
whether
believers
can
take
up
arms
or
whether
any
of
the
military
profession
can
be
admitted
as
members
of
the
christian
church
but
in
his
book
entitled
the
soldier
crown
after
some
objections
against
the
profession
of
arms
he
makes
a
distinction
between
those
who
are
engaged
in
the
army
before
baptism
and
those
who
entered
after
they
had
made
the
baptismal
vow
it
evidently
alters
the
case
with
those
who
were
soldiers
before
their
conversion
to
christianity
john
admitted
them
to
baptism
in
one
instance
christ
approved
and
in
another
peter
instructed
a
faithful
centurion
yet
with
this
stipulation
that
they
must
either
like
many
others
relinquish
their
calling
or
be
careful
to
do
nothing
displeasing
to
god
he
was
sensible
then
that
they
continued
in
the
military
profession
after
baptism
which
they
would
by
no
means
have
done
if
they
had
understood
that
all
war
was
forbidden
by
christ
they
would
have
followed
the
example
of
the
soothsayers
the
magi
and
other
professors
of
forbidden
arts
who
ceased
to
practice
them
when
they
became
christians
in
the
book
quoted
above
commending
a
soldier
who
was
at
the
same
time
a
christian
he
says
o
soldier
glorious
in
god
the
second
observation
applies
to
the
case
of
those
who
declined
or
even
refused
bearing
arms
on
account
of
the
circumstances
of
the
times
which
would
have
required
them
to
do
many
acts
inconsistent
with
their
christian
calling
in
dolabella
letter
to
the
ephesians
which
is
to
be
found
in
josephus
we
see
that
the
jews
requested
an
exemption
from
military
expeditions
because
in
mingling
with
strangers
they
could
not
conveniently
have
observed
the
rites
of
their
own
laws
and
would
have
been
obliged
to
bear
arms
and
to
make
long
marches
on
the
sabbaths
and
we
are
informed
by
josephus
that
for
the
same
reasons
the
jews
obtained
their
discharge
of
lentulus
in
another
part
he
relates
that
when
the
jews
had
been
ordered
to
leave
the
city
of
rome
some
of
them
enlisted
in
the
army
and
that
others
who
out
of
respect
to
the
laws
of
their
country
for
the
reasons
before
mentioned
refused
to
bear
arms
were
punished
in
addition
to
these
a
third
reason
may
be
given
which
was
that
they
would
have
to
fight
against
their
own
people
against
whom
it
was
unlawful
to
bear
arms
especially
when
they
incurred
danger
and
enmity
for
adhering
to
the
mosaic
law
but
the
jews
whenever
they
could
do
it
without
these
inconveniences
served
under
foreign
princes
previously
stipulating
as
we
are
informed
by
josephus
for
liberty
to
live
according
to
the
laws
and
rules
of
their
own
country
tertullian
objects
to
the
military
service
of
his
own
times
on
account
of
dangers
and
inconveniences
very
similar
to
those
which
deterred
the
jews
in
his
book
on
idolatry
he
says
it
is
impossible
to
reconcile
the
oath
of
fidelity
to
serve
under
the
banners
of
christ
with
that
to
serve
under
the
banners
of
the
devil
because
the
soldiers
were
ordered
to
swear
by
jupiter
mars
and
the
other
heathen
gods
and
in
his
book
on
the
soldier
crown
he
asks
if
the
soldier
be
to
keep
watch
before
the
temples
which
he
has
renounced
to
sup
where
he
is
forbidden
by
the
apostle
and
to
guard
in
the
night
the
gods
whom
he
has
abjured
in
the
day
and
he
proceeds
with
asking
if
there
be
not
many
other
military
duties
which
ought
to
be
regarded
in
the
light
of
sins
the
third
point
of
view
in
which
the
subject
is
to
be
considered
relates
to
the
conduct
of
those
primitive
christians
who
in
the
ardour
of
zeal
aimed
at
the
most
brilliant
attainments
taking
the
divine
counsels
for
precepts
of
obligation
the
christians
says
athenagoras
never
go
to
law
with
those
who
rob
them
salvian
says
it
was
commanded
by
christ
that
we
should
relinquish
the
object
of
dispute
rather
than
engage
in
law
suits
but
this
taken
in
so
general
an
acceptation
is
rather
by
the
way
of
counsel
in
order
to
attain
to
a
sublimer
mode
of
life
than
intended
as
a
positive
precept
thus
many
of
the
primitive
fathers
condemned
all
oaths
without
exception
yet
paul
in
matters
of
great
importance
made
use
of
these
solemn
appeals
to
god
a
christian
in
tatian
said
i
refuse
the
office
of
praetor
and
in
the
words
of
tertullian
a
christian
is
not
ambitious
of
the
aedile
office
in
the
same
manner
lactantius
maintains
that
a
just
man
such
as
he
wishes
a
christian
to
be
ought
not
to
engage
in
war
nor
as
all
his
wants
can
be
supplied
at
home
even
to
go
to
sea
how
many
of
the
primitive
fathers
dissuade
christians
from
second
marriages
all
these
counsels
are
good
recommending
excellent
attainments
highly
acceptable
to
god
yet
they
are
not
required
of
us
by
any
absolute
law
the
observations
already
made
are
sufficient
to
answer
the
objections
derived
from
the
primitive
times
of
christianity
now
in
order
to
confirm
our
opinions
we
may
observe
that
they
have
the
support
of
writers
even
of
greater
antiquity
who
think
that
capital
punishments
may
be
inflicted
and
that
wars
which
rest
upon
the
same
authority
may
be
lawfully
engaged
in
by
christians
clemens
alexandrinus
says
that
a
christian
if
like
moses
he
be
called
to
the
exercise
of
sovereign
power
will
be
a
living
law
to
his
subjects
rewarding
the
good
and
punishing
the
wicked
and
in
another
place
describing
the
habit
of
a
christian
he
says
it
would
become
him
to
go
barefoot
unless
he
were
a
soldier
in
the
work
usually
entitled
the
constitutions
of
clemens
romanus
we
find
that
it
is
not
all
killing
which
is
considered
unlawful
but
only
that
of
the
innocent
yet
the
administration
of
judicial
punishments
must
be
reserved
to
the
supreme
power
alone
but
without
resting
upon
individual
authorities
we
can
appeal
to
the
public
authority
of
the
church
which
ought
to
have
the
greatest
weight
from
hence
it
is
evident
that
none
were
ever
refused
baptism
or
excommunicated
by
the
church
merely
for
bearing
arms
which
they
ought
to
have
been
had
the
military
profession
been
repugnant
to
the
terms
of
the
new
covenant
in
the
constitutions
just
quoted
the
writer
speaking
of
those
who
in
the
primitive
times
were
admitted
to
baptism
or
refused
that
ordinance
says
let
a
soldier
who
desires
to
be
admitted
be
taught
to
forbear
from
violence
and
false
accusations
and
to
be
content
with
his
regular
pay
if
he
promises
obedience
let
him
be
admitted
tertullian
in
his
apology
speaking
in
the
character
of
christians
says
we
sail
along
with
you
and
we
engage
in
the
same
wars
having
a
little
before
observed
we
are
but
strangers
yet
we
have
filled
all
your
cities
your
islands
your
castles
your
municipal
towns
your
councils
and
even
your
camps
he
had
related
in
the
same
book
that
rain
had
been
obtained
for
the
emperor
marcus
aurelius
by
the
prayers
of
the
christian
soldiers
in
his
book
of
the
crown
he
commends
a
soldier
who
had
thrown
away
his
garland
for
a
courage
superior
to
that
of
his
brethren
in
arms
and
informs
us
that
he
had
many
christian
fellow
soldiers
to
these
proofs
may
be
added
the
honours
of
martyrdom
given
by
the
church
to
some
soldiers
who
had
been
cruelly
persecuted
and
had
even
suffered
death
for
the
sake
of
christ
among
whom
are
recorded
three
of
paul
companions
cerialis
who
suffered
martyrdom
under
decius
marinus
under
valerian
fifty
under
aurelian
victor
maurus
and
valentinus
a
lieutenant
general
under
maximian
about
the
same
time
marcellus
the
centurion
severian
under
licinius
cyprian
in
speaking
of
laurentinus
and
ignatius
both
africans
says
they
too
served
in
the
armies
of
earthly
princes
yet
they
were
truly
spiritual
soldiers
of
god
defeating
the
wiles
of
the
devil
by
a
steady
confession
of
the
name
of
christ
and
earning
the
palms
and
crowns
of
the
lord
by
their
sufferings
and
from
hence
it
is
plain
what
was
the
general
opinion
of
the
primitive
christians
upon
war
even
before
the
emperors
became
christians
it
need
not
be
thought
surprising
if
the
christians
of
those
times
were
unwilling
to
appear
at
trials
for
life
since
for
the
most
part
the
persons
to
be
tried
were
christians
in
other
respects
too
besides
being
unwilling
to
witness
the
unmerited
sufferings
of
their
persecuted
brethren
the
roman
laws
were
more
severe
than
christian
lenity
could
allow
of
as
may
be
seen
from
the
single
instance
of
the
silanian
decree
of
the
senate
indeed
capital
punishments
were
not
abolished
even
after
constantine
embraced
and
began
to
encourage
the
christian
religion
he
himself
among
other
laws
enacted
one
similar
to
that
of
the
ancient
romans
for
punishing
parricides
by
sewing
them
in
a
sack
with
certain
animals
and
throwing
them
into
the
sea
or
the
nearest
river
this
law
is
to
be
found
in
his
code
under
the
title
of
the
murders
of
parents
or
children
yet
in
other
respects
he
was
so
gentle
in
punishing
criminals
that
he
is
blamed
by
many
historians
for
his
excessive
lenity
constantine
we
are
informed
by
historians
had
at
that
time
many
christians
in
his
army
and
he
used
the
name
of
christ
as
the
motto
upon
his
standards
from
that
time
too
the
military
oath
was
changed
to
the
form
which
is
found
in
vegetius
and
the
soldier
swore
by
god
and
christ
and
the
holy
spirit
and
the
majesty
of
the
emperor
to
whom
as
next
to
god
homage
and
reverence
are
due
from
mankind
nor
out
of
so
many
bishops
at
that
time
many
of
whom
suffered
the
most
cruel
treatment
for
their
religion
do
we
read
of
a
single
one
who
dissuaded
constantine
by
the
terrors
of
divine
wrath
from
inflicting
capital
punishments
or
prosecuting
wars
or
who
deterred
the
christians
for
the
same
reasons
from
serving
in
the
armies
though
most
of
those
bishops
were
strict
observers
of
discipline
who
would
by
no
means
dissemble
in
points
relating
to
the
duty
of
the
emperors
or
of
others
among
this
class
in
the
time
of
theodosius
we
may
rank
ambrose
who
in
his
seventh
discourse
says
there
is
nothing
wrong
in
bearing
arms
but
to
bear
arms
from
motives
of
rapine
is
a
sin
indeed
and
in
his
first
book
of
offices
he
maintains
the
same
opinion
that
the
courage
which
defends
country
against
the
incursions
of
barbarians
or
protects
one
family
and
home
from
the
attacks
of
robbers
is
complete
justice
these
arguments
so
decidedly
shew
the
opinions
of
the
primitive
christians
in
the
support
of
just
and
necessary
war
that
the
subject
requires
no
farther
proof
or
elucidation
nor
is
the
argument
invalidated
by
a
fact
pretty
generally
known
that
bishops
and
other
christians
often
interceded
in
behalf
of
criminals
to
mitigate
the
punishment
of
death
and
that
any
who
had
taken
refuge
in
churches
were
not
given
up
but
upon
the
promise
of
their
lives
being
spared
a
custom
was
introduced
likewise
of
releasing
all
prisoners
about
the
time
of
easter
but
all
these
instances
if
carefully
examined
will
be
found
the
voluntary
acts
of
christian
kindness
embracing
every
opportunity
to
do
good
and
not
a
settled
point
of
public
opinion
condemning
all
capital
punishments
therefore
those
favours
were
not
universal
but
limited
to
times
and
places
and
even
the
intercessions
themselves
were
modified
with
certain
exceptions

the

and

the

and

that

the

further

that

requisite
to

distinction
of
the
real
differences
that
exist
under
similar
names
distinction
between
the
right
to
sovereign
power
and
the
mode
of
exercising
it
i
the
first
and
most
necessary
divisions
of
war
are
into
one
kind
called
private
another
public
and
another
mixed
now
public
war
is
carried
on
by
the
person
holding
the
sovereign
power
private
war
is
that
which
is
carried
on
by
private
persons
without
authority
from
the
state
a
mixed
war
is
that
which
is
carried
on
on
one
side
by
public
authority
and
on
the
other
by
private
persons
but
private
war
from
its
greater
antiquity
is
the
first
subject
for
inquiry
the
proofs
that
have
been
already
produced
to
shew
that
to
repel
violence
is
not
repugnant
to
natural
law
afford
a
satisfactory
reason
to
justify
private
war
as
far
as
the
law
of
nature
is
concerned
but
perhaps
it
may
be
thought
that
since
public
tribunals
have
been
erected
private
redress
of
wrongs
is
not
allowable
an
objection
which
is
very
just
yet
although
public
trials
and
courts
of
justice
are
not
institutions
of
nature
but
erected
by
the
invention
of
men
yet
as
it
is
much
more
conducive
to
the
peace
of
society
for
a
matter
in
dispute
to
be
decided
by
a
disinterested
person
than
by
the
partiality
and
prejudice
of
the
party
aggrieved
natural
justice
and
reason
will
dictate
the
necessity
and
advantage
of
every
one
submitting
to
the
equitable
decisions
of
public
judges
paulus
the
lawyer
observes
that
what
can
be
done
by
a
magistrate
with
the
authority
of
the
state
should
never
be
intrusted
to
individuals
as
private
redress
would
give
rise
to
greater
disturbance
and
the
reason
king
why
laws
were
invented
was
to
prevent
any
one
from
using
personal
violence
for
wherein
would
peace
differ
from
all
the
confusion
of
war
if
private
disputes
were
terminated
by
force
and
the
law
calls
it
force
for
any
man
to
seize
what
he
thinks
his
due
without
seeking
a
legal
remedy
ii
it
is
a
matter
beyond
all
doubt
that
the
liberty
of
private
redress
which
once
existed
was
greatly
abridged
after
courts
of
justice
were
established
yet
there
may
be
cases
in
which
private
redress
must
be
allowed
as
for
instance
if
the
way
to
legal
justice
were
not
open
for
when
the
law
prohibits
any
one
from
redressing
his
own
wrongs
it
can
only
be
understood
to
apply
to
circumstances
where
a
legal
remedy
exists
now
the
obstruction
in
the
way
to
legal
redress
may
be
either
temporary
or
absolute
temporary
where
it
is
impossible
for
the
injured
party
to
wait
for
a
legal
remedy
without
imminent
danger
and
even
destruction
as
for
instance
if
a
man
were
attacked
in
the
night
or
in
a
secret
place
where
no
assistance
could
be
procured
absolute
either
as
the
right
or
the
fact
may
require
now
there
are
many
situations
where
the
right
must
cease
from
the
impossibility
of
supporting
it
in
a
legal
way
as
in
unoccupied
places
on
the
seas
in
a
wilderness
or
desert
island
or
any
other
place
where
there
is
no
civil
government
all
legal
remedy
too
ceases
by
fact
when
subjects
will
not
submit
to
the
judge
or
if
he
refuses
openly
to
take
cognizance
of
matters
in
dispute
the
assertion
that
all
private
war
is
not
made
repugnant
to
the
law
of
nature
by
the
erection
of
legal
tribunals
may
be
understood
from
law
given
to
the
jews
wherein
god
thus
speaks
by
the
mouth
of
moses
exod
xxii
if
a
thief
be
found
breaking
up
that
is
by
night
and
be
smitten
that
he
dies
there
shall
no
blood
be
shed
for
him
but
if
the
sun
be
risen
upon
him
there
shall
be
blood
shed
for
him
now
this
law
making
so
accurate
a
distinction
in
the
merits
of
the
case
seems
not
only
to
imply
impunity
for
killing
any
one
in
but
to
explain
a
natural
right
founded
not
on
any
special
divine
command
but
on
the
common
principles
of
justice
from
whence
other
nations
have
plainly
followed
the
same
rule
the
passage
of
the
twelve
tables
is
well
known
undoubtedly
taken
from
the
old
athenian
law
if
a
thief
commit
a
robbery
in
the
night
and
a
man
kill
him
he
is
killed
lawfully
thus
by
the
laws
of
all
known
and
civilized
nations
the
person
is
judged
innocent
who
kills
another
forcibly
attempting
or
endangering
his
life
a
conspiring
and
universal
testimony
which
proves
that
in
justifiable
homicide
there
is
nothing
repugnant
to
the
law
of
nature
iv
public
war
according
to
the
law
of
nations
is
either
solemn
that
is
formal
or
less
solemn
that
is
informal
the
name
of
lawful
war
is
commonly
given
to
what
is
here
called
formal
in
the
same
sense
in
which
a
regular
will
is
opposed
to
a
codicil
or
a
lawful
marriage
to
the
cohabitation
of
slaves
this
opposition
by
no
means
implies
that
it
is
not
allowed
to
any
man
if
he
pleases
to
make
a
codicil
or
to
slaves
to
cohabit
in
matrimony
but
only
that
by
the
civil
law
formal
wills
and
solemn
marriages
were
attended
with
peculiar
privileges
and
effects
these
observations
were
the
more
necessary
because
many
from
a
misconception
of
the
word
just
or
lawful
think
that
all
wars
to
which
those
epithets
do
not
apply
are
condemned
as
unjust
and
unlawful
now
to
give
a
war
the
formality
required
by
the
law
of
nations
two
things
are
necessary
in
the
first
place
it
must
be
made
on
both
sides
by
the
sovereign
power
of
the
state
and
in
the
next
place
it
must
be
accompanied
with
certain
formalities
both
of
which
are
so
essential
that
one
is
insufficient
without
the
other
now
a
public
war
less
solemn
may
be
made
without
those
formalities
even
against
private
persons
and
by
any
magistrate
whatever
and
indeed
considering
the
thing
without
respect
to
the
civil
law
every
magistrate
in
case
of
resistance
seems
to
have
a
right
to
take
up
arms
to
maintain
his
authority
in
the
execution
of
his
office
as
well
as
to
defend
the
people
committed
to
his
protection
but
as
a
whole
state
is
by
war
involved
in
danger
it
is
an
established
law
in
almost
all
nations
that
no
war
can
be
made
but
by
the
authority
of
the
sovereign
in
each
state
there
is
such
a
law
as
this
in
the
last
book
of
plato
on
laws
and
by
the
roman
law
to
make
war
or
levy
troops
without
a
commission
from
the
prince
was
high
treason
according
to
the
cornelian
law
also
enacted
by
lucius
cornelius
sylla
to
do
so
without
authority
from
the
people
amounted
to
the
same
crime
in
the
code
of
justinian
there
is
a
constitution
made
by
valentinian
and
valens
that
no
one
should
bear
arms
without
their
knowledge
and
authority
conformably
to
this
rule
augustin
says
that
as
peace
is
most
agreeable
to
the
natural
state
of
man
it
is
proper
that
princes
should
have
the
sole
authority
to
devise
and
execute
the
operations
of
war
yet
this
general
rule
like
all
others
in
its
application
must
always
be
limited
by
equity
and
discretion
in
certain
cases
this
authority
may
be
communicated
to
others
for
it
is
a
point
settled
beyond
all
doubt
that
subordinate
magistrates
may
by
their
officers
reduce
a
few
disobedient
and
tumultuous
persons
to
subjection
provided
that
to
do
it
it
requires
not
a
force
of
such
enormous
magnitude
as
might
endanger
the
state
again
if
the
danger
be
so
imminent
as
to
allow
of
no
time
for
an
application
to
the
sovereign
executive
power
here
too
the
necessity
is
admitted
as
an
exception
to
the
general
rule
lucius
pinarius
the
governor
of
enna
a
sicilian
garrison
presuming
upon
this
right
upon
receiving
certain
information
that
the
inhabitants
had
formed
a
conspiracy
to
revolt
to
the
carthaginians
put
them
all
to
the
sword
and
by
that
means
saved
the
place
franciscus
victoria
allows
the
inhabitants
of
a
town
to
take
up
arms
even
without
such
a
case
of
necessity
to
redress
their
own
wrongs
which
the
prince
neglects
to
avenge
but
such
an
opinion
is
rejected
by
others
whether
the
circumstances
under
which
subordinate
magistrates
are
authorised
to
use
military
force
can
properly
be
called
public
war
or
not
is
a
matter
of
dispute
among
legal
writers
some
affirming
and
others
denying
it
if
indeed
we
call
no
other
public
war
but
that
which
is
made
by
magisterial
authority
there
is
no
doubt
but
that
such
suppressions
of
tumult
are
public
wars
and
those
who
in
such
cases
resist
the
magistrate
in
the
execution
of
his
office
incur
the
guilt
of
rebellion
against
superiors
but
if
public
war
is
taken
in
the
higher
sense
of
formal
war
as
it
undoubtedly
often
is
those
are
not
public
wars
because
to
entitle
them
to
the
full
rights
of
such
the
declaration
of
the
sovereign
power
and
other
requisites
are
wanting
nor
do
the
loss
of
property
and
the
military
executions
to
which
the
offenders
are
subject
at
all
affect
the
question
for
those
casualties
are
not
so
peculiarly
attached
to
formal
war
as
to
be
excluded
from
all
other
kinds
for
it
may
happen
as
in
an
extensive
empire
for
instance
that
persons
in
subordinate
authority
may
when
attacked
or
threatened
with
attack
have
powers
granted
to
commence
military
operations
in
which
case
the
war
must
be
supposed
to
commence
by
the
authority
of
the
sovereign
power
as
a
person
is
considered
to
be
the
author
of
a
measure
which
by
virtue
of
his
authority
he
empowers
another
to
perform
the
more
doubtful
point
is
whether
where
there
is
no
such
commission
a
conjecture
of
what
is
the
will
of
the
sovereign
power
be
sufficient
this
seems
not
admissible
for
it
is
not
sufficient
to
consider
what
we
suppose
would
be
the
pleasure
if
he
were
consulted
but
what
would
be
his
actual
will
in
matters
admitting
of
time
for
deliberation
even
though
he
were
not
formally
consulted
if
a
law
was
to
be
passed
upon
those
matters
for
though
under
some
particular
circumstances
it
may
be
necessary
to
waive
consulting
the
will
of
the
sovereign
yet
this
would
by
no
means
authorise
it
as
a
general
practice
for
the
safety
of
the
state
would
be
endangered
if
subordinate
powers
should
usurp
the
right
of
making
war
at
their
discretion
it
was
not
without
reason
that
cneus
manlius
was
accused
by
his
lieutenants
of
having
made
war
upon
the
galatians
without
authority
from
the
roman
people
for
though
the
galatians
had
supplied
antiochus
with
troops
yet
as
peace
had
been
made
with
him
it
rested
with
the
roman
people
and
not
with
manlius
to
determine
in
what
manner
the
galatians
should
be
punished
for
assisting
an
enemy
cato
proposed
that
julius
caesar
should
be
delivered
up
to
the
germans
for
having
attacked
them
in
violation
of
his
promise
a
proposal
proceeding
rather
from
the
desire
to
be
rid
of
a
formidable
rival
than
from
any
principle
of
justice
the
case
was
thus
the
germans
had
assisted
the
gauls
enemies
of
the
roman
people
therefore
they
had
no
reason
to
complain
of
the
injury
done
to
them
if
the
war
against
the
gauls
in
which
they
had
made
themselves
a
party
concerned
was
just
but
caesar
ought
to
have
contented
himself
with
driving
the
germans
out
of
gaul
the
province
assigned
him
without
pursuing
them
into
their
own
country
especially
as
there
was
no
farther
danger
to
be
apprehended
from
them
unless
he
had
first
consulted
the
roman
people
it
was
plain
then
the
germans
had
no
right
to
demand
the
surrender
of
caesar
person
though
the
romans
had
a
right
to
punish
him
for
having
exceeded
his
commission
on
a
similar
occasion
the
carthaginians
answered
the
romans
it
is
not
the
subject
of
inquiry
whether
hannibal
has
besieged
saguntum
by
his
own
private
or
by
public
authority
but
whether
justly
or
unjustly
for
with
respect
to
one
of
our
own
subjects
it
is
our
business
to
inquire
by
what
authority
he
has
acted
but
the
matter
of
discussion
with
you
is
whether
he
has
broken
any
treaty
cicero
defends
the
conduct
of
octavius
and
decimus
brutus
who
had
taken
up
arms
against
antony
but
though
it
was
evident
that
antony
deserved
to
be
treated
as
an
enemy
yet
they
ought
to
have
waited
for
the
determination
of
the
senate
and
people
of
rome
whether
it
were
for
the
public
interest
not
to
take
notice
of
his
conduct
or
to
punish
it
to
agree
to
terms
of
peace
with
him
or
to
have
recourse
to
arms
this
would
have
been
proper
for
no
one
is
obliged
to
exercise
the
right
of
punishing
an
enemy
if
it
is
attended
with
probable
danger
but
even
if
it
had
been
judged
expedient
to
declare
antony
an
enemy
the
choice
of
the
persons
to
conduct
the
war
should
have
been
left
to
the
senate
and
people
of
rome
thus
when
cassius
demanded
assistance
of
the
rhodians
according
to
treaty
they
answered
they
would
send
it
if
the
senate
thought
proper
this
refutation
of
cicero
opinion
will
serve
along
with
many
other
instances
to
be
met
with
as
an
admonition
not
to
be
carried
away
by
the
opinions
of
the
most
celebrated
writers
particularly
the
most
brilliant
orators
who
often
speak
to
suit
the
circumstances
of
the
moment
but
all
political
investigation
requires
a
cool
and
steady
judgment
not
to
be
biased
by
examples
which
may
rather
be
excused
than
vindicated
since
then
it
has
already
been
established
that
no
war
can
lawfully
be
made
but
by
the
sovereign
power
of
each
state
in
respect
to
all
the
questions
connected
with
war
it
will
be
necessary
to
examine
what
that
sovereign
power
is
and
who
are
the
persons
that
hold
it
vi
the
moral
power
then
of
governing
a
state
which
is
called
by
thucydides
the
civil
power
is
described
as
consisting
of
three
parts
which
form
the
necessary
substance
of
every
state
and
those
are
the
right
of
making
its
own
laws
executing
them
in
its
own
manner
and
appointing
its
own
magistrates
aristotle
in
the
fourth
book
of
his
politics
comprises
the
sovereignty
of
a
state
in
the
exercise
of
the
deliberative
executive
and
judicial
powers
to
the
deliberative
branch
he
assigns
the
right
of
deciding
upon
peace
or
war
making
or
annulling
treaties
and
framing
and
passing
new
laws
to
these
he
adds
the
power
of
inflicting
death
banishment
and
forfeiture
and
of
punishing
also
for
public
peculation
in
the
exercise
of
judicial
power
he
includes
not
only
the
punishment
of
crimes
and
misdemeanors
but
the
redress
of
civil
injuries
dionysius
of
halicarnassus
points
out
three
distinguishing
marks
of
sovereign
power
and
those
are
the
right
of
appointing
magistrates
the
right
of
enacting
and
repealing
laws
and
the
right
of
making
war
and
peace
to
which
in
another
part
he
adds
the
administration
of
justice
the
supreme
authority
in
matters
of
religion
and
the
right
of
calling
general
councils
a
true
definition
comprehends
every
possible
branch
of
authority
that
can
grow
out
of
the
possession
and
exercise
of
sovereign
power
for
the
ruler
of
every
state
must
exercise
his
authority
either
in
person
or
through
the
medium
of
others
his
own
personal
acts
must
be
either
general
or
special
he
may
be
said
to
do
general
acts
in
passing
or
repealing
laws
respecting
either
temporal
matters
or
spiritual
concerns
as
far
as
the
latter
relate
to
the
welfare
of
the
state
the
knowledge
of
these
principles
is
called
by
aristotle
the
masterpiece
in
the
science
of
government
the
particular
acts
of
the
sovereign
are
either
directly
of
a
public
nature
or
a
private
but
even
the
latter
bear
reference
to
his
public
capacity
now
the
acts
of
the
sovereign
executive
power
of
a
directly
public
kind
are
the
making
of
peace
and
war
and
treaties
and
the
imposition
of
taxes
and
other
similar
exercises
of
authority
over
the
persons
and
property
of
its
subjects
which
constitute
the
sovereignty
of
the
state
aristotle
calls
the
knowledge
of
this
practice
political
and
deliberative
science
the
private
acts
of
the
sovereign
are
those
in
which
by
his
authority
disputes
between
individuals
are
decided
as
it
is
conducive
to
the
peace
of
society
that
these
should
be
settled
this
is
called
by
aristotle
the
judicial
power
thus
the
acts
of
the
sovereign
are
done
in
his
name
by
his
magistrates
or
other
officers
among
whom
ambassadors
are
reckoned
and
in
the
exercise
of
all
those
rights
sovereign
power
consists
vii
that
power
is
called
sovereign
whose
actions
are
not
subject
to
the
controul
of
any
other
power
so
as
to
be
annulled
at
the
pleasure
of
any
other
human
will
the
term
any
other
human
will
exempts
the
sovereign
himself
from
this
restriction
who
may
annul
his
own
acts
as
may
also
his
successor
who
enjoys
the
same
right
having
the
same
power
and
no
other
we
are
to
consider
then
what
is
the
subject
in
which
this
sovereign
power
exists
now
the
subject
is
in
one
respect
common
and
in
another
proper
as
the
body
is
the
common
subject
of
sight
the
eye
the
proper
so
the
common
subject
of
sovereign
power
is
the
state
which
has
already
been
said
to
be
a
perfect
society
of
men
now
those
nations
who
are
in
a
state
of
subjugation
to
another
power
as
the
roman
provinces
were
are
excluded
from
this
definition
for
those
nations
are
not
sovereign
states
of
themselves
in
the
present
acceptation
of
the
word
but
are
subordinate
members
of
a
great
state
as
slaves
are
members
of
a
household
again
it
happens
that
many
states
forming
each
an
independent
body
may
have
one
head
for
political
are
not
like
natural
bodies
to
only
one
of
which
the
same
head
can
belong
whereas
in
the
former
one
person
can
exercise
the
function
of
the
head
to
many
distinct
bodies
as
a
certain
proof
of
which
when
the
reigning
house
has
become
extinct
the
sovereign
power
returns
to
the
hands
of
the
nation
so
it
may
happen
that
many
states
may
be
connected
together
by
the
closest
federal
union
which
strabo
in
more
places
than
one
calls
a
system
and
yet
each
retain
the
condition
of
a
perfect
individual
state
which
has
been
observed
by
aristotle
and
others
in
different
parts
of
their
writings
therefore
the
common
subject
of
sovereign
power
is
the
state
taken
in
the
sense
already
explained
the
proper
subject
is
one
or
more
persons
according
to
the
laws
and
customs
of
each
nation
this
is
called
by
galen
in
the
sixth
book
de
placitis
hippocrate
et
platonis
the
first
power
of
the
state
viii
and
here
is
the
proper
place
for
refuting
the
opinion
of
those
who
maintain
that
everywhere
and
without
exception
the
sovereign
power
is
vested
in
the
people
so
that
they
have
a
right
to
restrain
and
punish
kings
for
an
abuse
of
their
power
however
there
is
no
man
of
sober
wisdom
who
does
not
see
the
incalculable
mischiefs
which
such
opinions
have
occasioned
and
may
still
occasion
and
upon
the
following
grounds
they
may
be
refuted
from
the
jewish
as
well
as
the
roman
law
it
appears
that
any
one
might
engage
himself
in
private
servitude
to
whom
he
pleased
now
if
an
individual
may
do
so
why
may
not
a
whole
people
for
the
benefit
of
better
government
and
more
certain
protection
completely
transfer
their
sovereign
rights
to
one
or
more
persons
without
reserving
any
portion
to
themselves
neither
can
it
be
alleged
that
such
a
thing
is
not
to
be
presumed
for
the
question
is
not
what
is
to
be
presumed
in
a
doubtful
case
but
what
may
lawfully
be
done
nor
is
it
any
more
to
the
purpose
to
object
to
the
inconveniences
which
may
and
actually
do
arise
from
a
people
thus
surrendering
their
rights
for
it
is
not
in
the
power
of
man
to
devise
any
form
of
government
free
from
imperfections
and
dangers
as
a
dramatic
writer
says
you
must
either
take
these
advantages
with
those
imperfections
or
resign
your
pretensions
to
both
now
as
there
are
different
ways
of
living
some
of
a
worse
and
some
of
a
better
kind
left
to
the
choice
of
every
individual
so
a
nation
under
certain
circumstances
when
for
instance
the
succession
to
the
throne
is
extinct
or
the
throne
has
by
any
other
means
become
vacant
may
chuse
what
form
of
government
she
pleases
nor
is
this
right
to
be
measured
by
the
excellence
of
this
or
that
form
of
government
on
which
there
may
be
varieties
of
opinion
but
by
the
will
of
the
people
there
may
be
many
reasons
indeed
why
a
people
may
entirely
relinquish
their
rights
and
surrender
them
to
another
for
instance
they
may
have
no
other
means
of
securing
themselves
from
the
danger
of
immediate
destruction
or
under
the
pressure
of
famine
it
may
be
the
only
way
through
which
they
can
procure
support
for
if
the
campanians
formerly
when
reduced
by
necessity
surrendered
themselves
to
the
roman
people
in
the
following
terms
senators
of
rome
we
consign
to
your
dominion
the
people
of
campania
and
the
city
of
capua
our
lands
our
temples
and
all
things
both
divine
and
human
and
if
another
people
as
appian
relates
offered
to
submit
to
the
romans
and
were
refused
what
is
there
to
prevent
any
nation
from
submitting
in
the
same
manner
to
one
powerful
sovereign
it
may
also
happen
that
a
master
of
a
family
having
large
possessions
will
suffer
no
one
to
reside
upon
them
on
any
other
terms
or
an
owner
having
many
slaves
may
give
them
their
liberty
upon
condition
of
their
doing
certain
services
and
paying
certain
rents
of
which
examples
may
be
produced
thus
tacitus
speaking
of
the
german
slaves
says
each
has
his
own
separate
habitation
and
his
own
household
to
govern
the
master
considers
him
as
a
tenant
bound
to
pay
a
certain
rent
in
corn
cattle
and
wearing
apparel
and
this
is
the
utmost
extent
of
servitude
aristotle
in
describing
the
requisites
which
fit
men
for
servitude
says
that
those
men
whose
powers
are
chiefly
confined
to
the
body
and
whose
principal
excellence
consists
in
affording
bodily
service
are
naturally
slaves
because
it
is
their
interest
to
be
so
in
the
same
manner
some
nations
are
of
such
a
disposition
that
they
are
more
calculated
to
obey
than
to
govern
which
seems
to
have
been
the
opinion
which
the
cappadocians
held
of
themselves
who
when
the
romans
offered
them
a
popular
government
refused
to
accept
it
because
the
nation
they
said
could
not
exist
in
safety
without
a
king
thus
philostratus
in
the
life
of
apollonius
says
that
it
was
foolish
to
offer
liberty
to
the
thracians
the
mysians
and
the
getae
which
they
were
not
capable
of
enjoying
the
example
of
nations
who
have
for
many
ages
lived
happily
under
a
kingly
government
has
induced
many
to
give
the
preference
to
that
form
livy
says
that
the
cities
under
eumenes
would
not
have
changed
their
condition
for
that
of
any
free
state
whatsoever
and
sometimes
a
state
is
so
situated
that
it
seems
impossible
it
can
preserve
its
peace
and
existence
without
submitting
to
the
absolute
government
of
a
single
person
which
many
wise
men
thought
to
be
the
case
with
the
roman
republic
in
the
time
of
augustus
caesar
from
these
and
causes
like
these
it
not
only
may
but
generally
does
happen
that
men
as
cicero
observes
in
the
second
book
of
his
offices
willingly
submit
to
the
supreme
authority
of
another
now
as
property
may
be
acquired
by
what
has
been
already
styled
just
war
by
the
same
means
the
rights
of
sovereignty
may
be
acquired
nor
is
the
term
sovereignty
here
meant
to
be
applied
to
monarchy
alone
but
to
government
by
nobles
from
any
share
in
which
the
people
are
excluded
for
there
never
was
any
government
so
purely
popular
as
not
to
require
the
exclusion
of
the
poor
of
strangers
women
and
minors
from
the
public
councils
some
states
have
other
nations
under
them
no
less
dependent
upon
their
will
than
subjects
upon
that
of
their
sovereign
princes
from
whence
arose
that
question
are
the
collatine
people
in
their
own
power
and
the
campanians
when
they
submitted
to
the
romans
are
said
to
have
passed
under
a
foreign
dominion
in
the
same
manner
acarnania
and
amphilochia
are
said
to
have
been
under
the
dominion
of
the
aetolians
peraea
and
caunus
under
that
of
the
rhodians
and
pydna
was
ceded
by
philip
to
the
olynthians
and
those
towns
that
had
been
under
the
spartans
when
they
were
delivered
from
their
dominion
received
the
name
of
the
free
laconians
the
city
of
cotyora
is
said
by
xenophon
to
have
belonged
to
the
people
of
sinope
nice
in
italy
according
to
strabo
was
adjudged
to
the
people
of
marseilles
and
the
island
of
pithecusa
to
the
neapolitans
we
find
in
frontinus
that
the
towns
of
calati
and
caudium
with
their
territories
were
adjudged
the
one
to
the
colony
of
capua
and
the
other
to
that
of
beneventum
otho
as
tacitus
relates
gave
the
cities
of
the
moors
to
the
province
of
baetia
none
of
these
instances
any
more
than
the
cessions
of
other
conquered
countries
could
be
admitted
if
it
were
a
received
rule
that
the
rights
of
sovereigns
are
under
the
controul
and
direction
of
subjects
now
it
is
plain
both
from
sacred
and
profane
history
that
there
are
kings
who
are
not
subject
to
the
controul
of
the
people
in
their
collective
body
god
addressing
the
people
of
israel
says
if
thou
shalt
say
i
will
place
a
king
over
me
and
to
samuel
shew
them
the
manner
of
the
king
who
shall
reign
over
them
hence
the
king
is
said
to
be
anointed
over
the
people
over
the
inheritance
of
the
lord
over
israel
solomon
is
styled
king
over
all
israel
thus
david
gives
thanks
to
god
for
subduing
the
people
under
him
and
christ
says
the
kings
of
the
nations
bear
rule
over
them
there
is
a
well
known
passage
in
horace
powerful
sovereigns
reign
over
their
own
subjects
and
the
supreme
being
over
sovereigns
themselves
seneca
thus
describes
the
three
forms
of
government
sometimes
the
supreme
power
is
lodged
in
the
people
sometimes
in
a
senate
composed
of
the
leading
men
of
the
state
sometimes
this
power
of
the
people
and
dominion
over
the
people
themselves
is
vested
in
a
single
person
of
the
last
description
are
those
who
as
plutarch
says
exercise
authority
not
according
to
the
laws
but
over
the
laws
and
in
herodotus
otanes
describes
a
monarch
as
one
whose
acts
are
not
subject
to
controul
dion
prusaeensis
also
and
pausanias
define
a
monarchy
in
the
same
terms
aristotle
says
there
are
some
kings
who
have
the
same
right
which
the
nation
elsewhere
possesses
over
persons
and
property
thus
when
the
roman
princes
began
to
exercise
regal
power
the
people
it
was
said
had
transferred
all
their
own
personal
sovereignty
to
them
which
gave
rise
to
the
saying
of
marcus
antoninus
the
philosopher
that
no
one
but
god
alone
can
be
judge
of
the
prince
dion
liii
speaking
of
such
a
prince
says
he
is
perfectly
master
of
his
own
actions
to
do
whatever
he
pleases
and
can
not
be
obliged
to
do
any
thing
against
his
will
such
anciently
was
the
power
of
the
inachidae
established
at
argos
in
greece
for
in
the
greek
tragedy
of
the
suppliants
aeschylus
has
introduced
the
people
thus
addressing
the
king
you
are
the
state
you
the
people
you
the
court
from
which
there
is
no
appeal
you
preside
over
the
altars
and
regulate
all
affairs
by
your
supreme
will
king
theseus
himself
in
euripides
speaks
in
very
different
terms
of
the
athenian
republic
the
city
is
not
governed
by
one
man
but
in
a
popular
form
by
an
annual
succession
of
magistrates
for
according
to
plutarch
explanation
theseus
was
the
general
in
war
and
the
guardian
of
the
laws
but
in
other
respects
nothing
more
than
a
citizen
so
that
they
who
are
limited
by
popular
controul
are
improperly
called
kings
thus
after
the
time
of
lycurgus
and
more
particularly
after
the
institution
of
the
ephori
the
kings
of
the
lacedaemonians
are
said
by
polybius
plutarch
and
cornelius
nepos
to
have
been
kings
more
in
name
than
in
reality
an
example
which
was
followed
by
the
rest
of
greece
thus
pausanias
says
of
the
argives
to
the
corinthians
the
argives
from
their
love
of
equality
have
reduced
their
kingly
power
very
low
so
that
they
have
left
the
posterity
of
cisus
nothing
more
than
the
shadow
of
kings
aristotle
denies
such
to
be
proper
forms
of
government
because
they
constitute
only
a
part
of
an
aristocracy
or
democracy
examples
also
may
be
found
of
nations
who
have
not
been
under
a
perpetual
regal
form
but
only
for
a
time
under
a
government
exempt
from
popular
controul
such
was
the
power
of
the
amimonians
among
the
cnidians
and
of
the
dictators
in
the
early
periods
of
the
roman
history
when
there
was
no
appeal
to
the
people
from
whence
livy
says
the
will
of
the
dictator
was
observed
as
a
law
indeed
they
found
this
submission
the
only
remedy
against
imminent
danger
and
in
the
words
of
cicero
the
dictatorship
possessed
all
the
strength
of
royal
power
it
will
not
be
difficult
to
refute
the
arguments
brought
in
favour
of
the
contrary
opinion
for
in
the
first
place
the
assertion
that
the
constituent
always
retains
a
controul
over
the
sovereign
power
which
he
has
contributed
to
establish
is
only
true
in
those
cases
where
the
continuance
and
existence
of
that
power
depends
upon
the
will
and
pleasure
of
the
constituent
but
not
in
cases
where
the
power
though
it
might
derive
its
origin
from
that
constituent
becomes
a
necessary
and
fundamental
part
of
the
established
law
of
this
nature
is
that
authority
to
which
a
woman
submits
when
she
gives
herself
to
a
husband
valentinian
the
emperor
when
the
soldiers
who
had
raised
him
to
the
throne
made
a
demand
of
which
he
did
not
approve
replied
soldiers
your
election
of
me
for
your
emperor
was
your
own
voluntary
choice
but
since
you
have
elected
me
it
depends
upon
my
pleasure
to
grant
your
request
it
becomes
you
to
obey
as
subjects
and
me
to
consider
what
is
proper
to
be
done
nor
is
the
assumption
true
that
all
kings
are
made
by
the
people
as
may
be
plainly
seen
from
the
instances
adduced
above
of
an
owner
admitting
strangers
to
reside
upon
his
demesnes
on
condition
of
their
obedience
and
of
nations
submitting
by
right
of
conquest
another
argument
is
derived
from
a
saying
of
the
philosophers
that
all
power
is
conferred
for
the
benefit
of
the
governed
and
not
of
the
governing
party
hence
from
the
nobleness
of
the
end
it
is
supposed
to
follow
that
subjects
have
a
superiority
over
the
sovereign
but
it
is
not
universally
true
that
all
power
is
conferred
for
the
benefit
of
the
party
governed
for
some
powers
are
conferred
for
the
sake
of
the
governor
as
the
right
of
a
master
over
a
slave
in
which
the
advantage
of
the
latter
is
only
a
contingent
and
adventitious
circumstance
in
the
same
manner
the
gain
of
a
physician
is
to
reward
him
for
his
labour
and
not
merely
to
promote
the
good
of
his
art
there
are
other
kinds
of
authority
established
for
the
benefit
of
both
parties
as
for
instance
the
authority
of
a
husband
over
his
wife
certain
governments
also
as
those
which
are
gained
by
right
of
conquest
may
be
established
for
the
benefit
of
the
sovereign
and
yet
convey
no
idea
of
tyranny
a
word
which
in
its
original
signification
implied
nothing
of
arbitrary
power
or
injustice
but
only
the
government
or
authority
of
a
prince
again
some
governments
may
be
formed
for
the
advantage
both
of
subjects
and
sovereign
as
when
a
people
unable
to
defend
themselves
put
themselves
under
the
protection
and
dominion
of
any
powerful
king
yet
it
is
not
to
be
denied
but
that
in
most
governments
the
good
of
the
subject
is
the
chief
object
which
is
regarded
and
that
what
cicero
has
said
after
herodotus
and
herodotus
after
hesiod
is
true
that
kings
were
appointed
in
order
that
men
might
enjoy
complete
justice
now
this
admission
by
no
means
goes
to
establish
the
inference
that
kings
are
amenable
to
the
people
for
though
guardianships
were
invented
for
the
benefit
of
wards
yet
the
guardian
has
a
right
to
authority
over
the
ward
nor
though
a
guardian
may
for
mismanagement
be
removed
from
his
trust
does
it
follow
that
a
king
may
for
the
same
reason
be
deposed
the
cases
are
quite
different
the
guardian
has
a
superior
to
judge
him
but
in
governments
as
there
must
be
some
dernier
resort
it
must
be
vested
either
in
an
individual
or
in
some
public
body
whose
misconduct
as
there
is
no
superior
tribunal
before
which
they
can
be
called
god
declares
that
he
himself
will
judge
he
either
punishes
their
offences
should
he
deem
it
necessary
or
permits
them
for
the
chastisement
of
his
people
this
is
well
expressed
by
tacitus
he
says
you
should
bear
with
the
rapacity
or
luxury
of
rulers
as
you
would
bear
with
drought
or
excessive
rains
or
any
other
calamities
of
nature
for
as
long
as
men
exist
there
will
be
faults
and
imperfections
but
these
are
not
of
uninterrupted
continuance
and
they
are
often
repaired
by
the
succession
of
better
times
and
marcus
aurelius
speaking
of
subordinate
magistrates
said
that
they
were
under
the
controul
of
the
sovereign
but
that
the
sovereign
was
amenable
to
god
there
is
a
remarkable
passage
in
gregory
of
tours
where
that
bishop
thus
addresses
the
king
of
france
if
any
of
us
sir
should
transgress
the
bounds
of
justice
he
may
be
punished
by
you
but
if
you
exceed
them
who
can
call
you
to
account
for
when
we
address
you
you
may
hear
us
if
you
please
but
if
you
will
not
who
can
judge
you
except
him
who
has
declared
himself
to
be
righteousness
among
the
maxims
of
the
essenes
porphyry
cites
a
passage
that
no
one
can
reign
without
the
special
appointment
of
divine
providence
irenaeus
has
expressed
this
well
kings
are
appointed
by
him
at
whose
command
men
are
created
and
their
appointment
is
suited
to
the
condition
of
those
whom
they
are
called
to
govern
there
is
the
same
thought
in
the
constitutions
of
clement
you
shall
fear
the
king
for
he
is
of
the
lord
appointment
nor
is
it
an
objection
to
what
has
been
said
that
some
nations
have
been
punished
for
the
offences
of
their
kings
for
this
does
not
happen
because
they
forbear
to
restrain
their
kings
but
because
they
seem
to
give
at
least
a
tacit
consent
to
their
vices
or
perhaps
without
respect
to
this
god
may
use
that
sovereign
power
which
he
has
over
the
life
and
death
of
every
man
to
inflict
a
punishment
upon
the
king
by
depriving
him
of
his
subjects
ix
there
are
some
who
frame
an
imaginary
kind
of
mutual
subjection
by
which
the
people
are
bound
to
obey
the
king
as
long
as
he
governs
well
but
his
government
is
subject
to
their
inspection
and
controul
if
they
were
to
say
that
his
duty
to
the
sovereign
does
not
oblige
any
one
to
do
an
act
manifestly
unjust
and
repugnant
to
the
law
of
god
they
would
say
nothing
but
what
is
true
and
universally
admitted
but
this
by
no
means
includes
a
right
to
any
controul
over
the
conduct
in
his
lawful
government
but
if
any
people
had
the
opportunity
of
dividing
the
sovereign
power
with
the
king
the
privileges
of
the
one
and
the
prerogatives
of
the
other
ought
to
be
defined
by
certain
bounds
which
might
easily
be
known
according
to
the
difference
of
places
persons
or
circumstances
now
the
supposed
good
or
evil
of
any
act
especially
in
political
matters
which
admit
of
great
variety
of
opinions
and
much
discussion
is
not
a
sufficient
mark
to
ascertain
these
bounds
from
whence
the
greatest
confusion
must
follow
if
under
pretence
of
promoting
good
or
averting
evil
measures
the
people
might
struggle
for
the
jurisdiction
a
turbulent
state
of
affairs
which
no
sober
minded
people
ever
wished
to
experience
x
after
refuting
false
opinions
it
remains
to
apply
some
cautions
which
may
point
out
the
way
to
ascertain
correctly
the
person
to
whom
sovereign
power
in
every
state
of
right
belongs
the
first
caution
necessary
is
to
avoid
being
deceived
by
ambiguous
terms
or
appearances
foreign
to
the
real
subject
for
instance
among
the
latins
although
the
terms
principality
and
kingdom
are
generally
opposed
to
each
other
when
caesar
says
that
the
father
of
vercingetorix
held
the
principality
of
gaul
and
was
put
to
death
for
aiming
at
sovereign
power
and
when
piso
in
tacitus
calls
germanicus
the
son
of
a
roman
prince
not
of
a
parthian
king
and
when
suetonius
says
that
caligula
was
on
the
point
of
converting
the
power
of
a
prince
into
that
of
a
king
and
velleius
asserts
that
maroboduus
not
contented
with
the
authority
of
a
prince
over
voluntary
adherents
and
dependents
was
grasping
in
his
mind
at
regal
power
yet
we
find
these
terms
though
in
reality
very
distinct
were
often
confounded
for
the
lacedaemonian
chiefs
the
descendants
of
hercules
though
subject
to
the
controul
of
the
ephori
were
nevertheless
called
kings
and
tacitus
says
that
among
the
ancient
germans
there
were
kings
who
governed
more
by
the
influence
of
persuasion
than
by
the
authority
of
power
livy
too
speaking
of
king
evander
describes
him
as
reigning
more
by
personal
authority
than
by
his
regal
power
and
aristotle
polybius
and
diodorus
give
the
names
of
kings
to
the
suffetes
or
judges
of
the
carthaginians
in
the
same
manner
solinus
also
calls
hanno
king
of
the
carthaginians
strabo
speaks
of
scepsis
in
troas
that
having
incorporated
the
milesians
into
the
state
it
formed
itself
into
a
democracy
leaving
the
descendants
of
the
ancient
kings
the
title
and
something
of
the
dignity
of
kings
on
the
other
hand
the
roman
emperors
after
they
had
exercised
openly
and
without
any
disguise
a
most
absolute
monarchical
power
were
notwithstanding
called
princes
and
in
some
popular
states
the
chief
magistrates
are
graced
with
ensigns
of
royalty
again
the
states
general
that
is
the
convention
of
those
who
represent
the
people
divided
into
classes
according
to
gunther
consist
of
three
orders
which
are
the
prelates
the
nobles
and
deputies
of
large
towns
in
some
places
they
serve
as
a
greater
council
to
the
king
to
communicate
to
him
the
complaints
of
his
people
which
might
otherwise
be
kept
from
his
ears
leaving
him
at
the
same
time
full
liberty
to
exercise
his
own
discretion
upon
the
matters
so
communicated
but
in
other
places
they
form
a
body
with
power
to
inquire
into
the
measures
and
to
make
laws
many
think
that
in
order
to
know
whether
a
prince
be
sovereign
or
not
it
is
proper
to
inquire
whether
his
title
to
the
crown
is
by
election
or
inheritance
for
they
maintain
that
hereditary
monarchies
alone
are
sovereign
but
this
can
not
be
received
as
a
general
criterion
for
sovereignty
consists
not
merely
in
the
title
to
the
throne
which
only
implies
that
the
successor
has
a
right
to
all
the
privileges
and
prerogatives
that
his
ancestors
enjoyed
but
it
by
no
means
affects
the
nature
or
extent
of
his
powers
for
right
of
election
conveys
all
the
powers
which
the
first
election
or
appointment
conferred
among
the
lacedaemonians
the
crown
was
hereditary
even
after
the
institution
of
the
ephori
and
aristotle
describing
the
chief
power
of
such
a
state
says
of
these
kingdoms
some
are
hereditary
and
others
elective
in
the
heroic
times
most
of
the
kingdoms
in
greece
were
of
this
description
as
we
are
informed
by
thucydides
the
roman
empire
on
the
contrary
even
after
the
power
of
the
senate
and
people
was
abolished
was
given
or
confirmed
by
election
xi
another
caution
is
necessary
for
to
inquire
into
the
matter
of
a
right
is
not
the
same
thing
as
to
examine
the
nature
of
its
tenure
a
distinction
which
takes
place
not
only
in
corporeal
but
in
incorporeal
possessions
for
a
right
of
passage
or
carriage
through
a
ground
is
no
less
a
right
than
that
which
entitles
a
man
to
the
possession
of
the
land
itself
now
some
hold
these
privileges
by
a
full
right
of
property
some
by
an
usufructuary
and
others
by
a
temporary
right
thus
the
roman
dictator
had
sovereign
power
by
a
temporary
right
in
the
same
manner
kings
both
those
who
are
the
first
of
their
line
elected
to
the
throne
and
those
who
succeed
them
in
the
lawful
order
enjoy
an
usufructuary
right
or
inalienable
right
but
some
sovereigns
hold
their
power
by
a
plenary
right
of
property
when
for
instance
it
comes
into
their
possession
by
the
right
of
lawful
conquest
or
when
a
people
to
avoid
greater
evils
make
an
unqualified
surrender
of
themselves
and
their
rights
into
their
hands
the
opinion
of
those
can
never
be
assented
to
who
say
that
the
power
of
the
dictator
was
not
sovereign
because
it
was
not
permanent
for
in
the
moral
world
the
nature
of
things
is
known
from
their
operations
the
powers
attended
with
equal
effects
are
entitled
to
equal
names
now
the
dictator
for
the
time
being
performed
all
acts
with
the
same
authority
as
the
most
absolute
sovereign
nor
could
any
other
power
annul
his
acts
the
permanence
therefore
of
uncertainty
alters
not
the
nature
of
a
right
although
it
would
undoubtedly
abridge
its
dignity
and
diminish
its
splendour

some
cases
motives

operate
distinctly
from
motives
of

polybius
accurately
distinguishes
these
motives
from
each

and
from
the
beginning
of
the

or
that
which
gave

to

was

when
ascanius
wounded

but
though
there
is
an
actual
distinction
between

causes
the
pretexts
and
the
beginning

yet
the
terms
used
to
express

livy

of

calls

the

deputies
said
you
romans
profess
to
believe
that
your
wars
are
successful
because
they
are
just
nor
do
you
boast
so
much
of
their
victorious
issue
as
of
the
just
principles
upon
which
you
make
them
in

of

against

gives
them
the
name
of
προφασεις
prophaseis
and
ἀρχας
archas
the
principal
drift
of
our
argument
rests
upon
these
justifiable
causes
to
which
the
sentiment
of
coriolanus
in
dionysius
of
halicarnassus
particularly
applies
he
says
in
the
first
place
i
beseech
you
to
consider
how
you
may
find
pious
and
just
pretexts
for
the
war
and
demosthenes
in
his
second
olynthiac
makes
a
similar
observation
i
think
that
as
in
a
ship
or
house
or
any
other
fabric
the
lowest
parts
ought
to
be
the
strongest
so
in
all
political
measures
the
motives
and
pretexts
ought
to
be
laid
deeply
in
the
principles
of
truth
and
justice
the
following
language
of
dion
cassius
is
no
less
applicable
to
the
question
justice
must
be
made
the
principal
ground
of
our
actions
for
with
such
support
there
is
the
best
hope
of
success
to
our
arms
but
without
that
any
point
which
may
be
gained
for
the
moment
has
no
firm
ground
to
rest
upon
to
which
may
be
added
the
words
of
cicero
who
maintains
those
wars
to
be
unjust
which
are
made
without
sufficient
cause
and
in
another
place
he
reproves
crassus
for
having
intended
to
pass
the
euphrates
when
there
was
no
cause
of
war
which
is
no
less
true
of
public
than
of
private
wars
hence
come
the
complaints
of
seneca
why
do
we
restrain
homicide
and
the
murder
of
individuals
but
glory
in
the
crime
of
slaughter
which
destroys
whole
nations
avarice
and
cruelty
know
not
any
bounds
by
decrees
of
the

and
of
the
people
cruel
acts
are
authorized
and
measures
which
are
pursued
by

of

are
forbidden
to
individuals
wars
indeed
undertaken
by

authority
are
attended
with
certain
effects
of

and
have
the
sanction
of
opinion
in
their
favour
but
they
are
not
the
less
criminal
when
made
without
just
cause
for
which
reason
alexander
was
not
improperly
styled
a
robber
by
the
scythian
ambassadors
as
may
be
seen
in
quintus
curtius
seneca
and
lucan
give
him
the

appellation
the

call
him
a
madman
and

pirate
once
presumed
to
rank
him
with
his

class
justin
speaks
of
philip
in
the

terms
who
in

dispute
between
two
rival
kings
stripped
both
of
their
dominions
with
all
the
treachery
and
violence
of
a
robber
augustin
has
a
pertinent
remark
on
this
subject
he
says
what
are
unjustly
acquired
dominions
but
the
spoils
of
robbery
in
the
same
strain
lactantius
says
men
captivated
with
the
appearances
of
vain
glory
give
the
names
of
virtues
to
their
crimes
injury
or
the
prevention
of
injury
forms
the
only
justifiable
cause
of
war
and
the
language
of
the
same
all
the
evil
consequences
of
war
are
to
be
laid
at
the
door
of
the
aggressor
thus
the
roman
herald
in
a
declaration
of
war
makes
a
solemn
appeal
against
the
aggressor
as
having
violated
the
laws
of
nations
and
refused
proper
satisfaction
ii
the
grounds
of
war
are
as
numerous
as
those
of
judicial
actions
for
where
the
power
of
law
ceases
there
war
begins
now
there
are
methods
in
law
to
prevent
intended
injuries
as
well
as
actions
for
those
actually
committed
for
civil
injuries
various
methods
of
redress
or
prevention
are
appointed
by
the
law
and
by
the
same
power
securities
are
provided
to
prevent
the
commission
of
crimes
and
misdemeanors
in
civil
cases
the
party
aggrieved
may
recover
damages
for
the
injuries
sustained
and
in
crimes
which
are
offences
against
the
public
the
aggressor
must
submit
to
actual
punishment
plato
in
his
ninth
book
on
laws
very
properly
makes
the
same
distinction
as
homer
had
done
before
him
now
reparation
or
indemnity
relates
to
what
either
does
or
did
belong
to
us
which
gives
rise
to
real
and
personal
actions
these
ascertain
our
right
to
the
damages
which
are
our
due
either
from
an
agreement
or
from
an
injury
received
a
right
which
is
termed
in
law
a
right
by
contract
or
injury
crimes
which
are
offences
against
society
are
prosecuted
by
indictment
that
is
by
an
accusation
in
the
name
of
the
sovereign
the
justifiable
causes
generally
assigned
for
war
are
three
defence
indemnity
and
punishment
all
which
are
comprised
in
the
declaration
of
camillus
against
the
gauls
enumerating
all
things
which
it
is
right
to
defend
to
recover
and
the
encroachment
on
which
it
is
right
to
punish
there
is
an
omission
in
this
enumeration
unless
the
word
recover
be
taken
in
its
most
extensive
sense
for
recovering
by
war
what
we
have
lost
includes
indemnity
for
the
past
as
well
as
the
prosecution
of
our
claim
to
a
debt
plato
has
not
omitted
to
notice
this
distinction
for
he
has
said
that
wars
are
made
to
punish
not
only
oppression
or
robbery
but
also
fraud
and
deception
with
whom
seneca
agrees
for
to
command
payment
of
what
you
owe
he
calls
an
equitable
sentence
stamped
with
the
authority
of
the
law
of
nations
indeed
the
form
which
was
prescribed
for
the
roman
heralds
to
use
in
declarations
of
war
bears
exactly
the
same
import
for
therein
the
aggressor
is
charged
with
having
neither
given
paid
nor
done
what
was
due
sallust
in
one
of
his
fragments
has
made
a
tribune
in
his
harangue
to
the
people
say
as
a
final
settlement
of
all
discussions
i
demand
restitution
according
to
the
law
of
nations
augustin
in
defining
those
to
be
just
wars
which
are
made
to
avenge
injuries
has
taken
the
word
avenge
in
a
general
sense
of
removing
and
preventing
as
well
as
punishing
aggressions
this
appears
to
be
his
meaning
from
the
following
sentence
of
the
passage
in
which
he
does
not
enumerate
the
particular
acts
which
amount
to
injury
but
adds
by
way
of
illustration
that
the
state
or
nation
which
has
neglected
to
punish
the
aggressions
of
its
own
subjects
or
to
make
reparation
for
the
losses
occasioned
by
those
aggressions
is
a
proper
object
of
hostility
and
attack
prompted
by
this
natural
knowledge
of
right
and
wrong
the
indian
king
as
we
are
informed
by
diodorus
accused
semiramis
of
having
commenced
war
against
him
without
having
received
any
injury
thus
the
romans
expostulated
with
the
senones
that
they
ought
not
to
attack
a
people
who
had
given
them
no
provocation
aristotle
in
the
second
book
and
second
chapter
of
his
analytics
says
war
generally
is
made
upon
those
who
have
first
done
an
injury
quintus
curtius
describes
the
abian
scythians
as
the
best
acquainted
with
the
principles
of
justice
of
any
of
the
barbarians
for
they
declined
having
recourse
to
arms
unless
provoked
by
aggression
a
just
cause
then
of
war
is
an
injury
which
though
not
actually
committed
threatens
our
persons
or
property
with
danger
iii
it
has
already
been
proved
that
when
our
lives
are
threatened
with
immediate
danger
it
is
lawful
to
kill
the
aggressor
if
the
danger
can
not
otherwise
be
avoided
an
instance
as
it
has
been
shewn
on
which
the
justice
of
private
war
rests
we
must
observe
that
this
kind
of
defence
derives
its
origin
from
the
principle
of
which
nature
has
given
to
every
living
creature
and
not
from
the
injustice
or
misconduct
of
the
aggressor
wherefore
though
he
may
be
clear
of
guilt
as
for
instance
a
soldier
in
actual
service
mistaking
my
person
for
that
of
another
or
a
madman
in
his
frenzy
or
a
man
walking
in
his
sleep
none
of
these
cases
deprive
me
of
the
right
of
against
those
persons
for
i
am
not
bound
to
submit
to
the
danger
or
mischief
intended
any
more
than
to
expose
myself
to
the
attacks
of
a
wild
beast
iv
it
admits
of
some
doubt
whether
those
who
unintentionally
obstruct
our
defence
or
escape
which
are
necessary
to
our
preservation
may
be
lawfully
maimed
or
killed
there
are
some
even
theologians
who
think
they
may
and
certainly
if
we
look
to
the
law
of
nature
alone
according
to
its
principles
our
own
preservation
should
have
much
more
weight
with
us
than
the
welfare
of
society
but
the
law
of
charity
especially
the
evangelical
law
which
has
put
our
neighbour
upon
a
level
with
ourselves
does
not
permit
it
thomas
aquinas
if
taken
in
a
right
sense
has
justly
observed
that
in
actual
no
man
can
be
said
to
be
purposely
killed
indeed
it
may
some
times
happen
that
there
is
no
other
way
for
a
person
to
save
himself
than
by
designedly
doing
an
act
by
which
the
death
of
an
aggressor
must
inevitably
ensue
yet
here
the
death
of
any
one
was
not
the
primary
object
intended
but
employed
as
the
only
means
of
security
which
the
moment
supplied
still
it
is
better
for
the
party
assaulted
if
he
can
safely
do
it
to
repel
or
disable
the
aggressor
than
to
shed
his
blood
the
danger
must
be
immediate
which
is
one
necessary
point
though
it
must
be
confessed
that
when
an
assailant
seizes
any
weapon
with
an
apparent
intention
to
kill
me
i
have
a
right
to
anticipate
and
prevent
the
danger
for
in
the
moral
as
well
as
the
natural
system
of
things
there
is
no
point
without
some
breadth
but
they
are
themselves
much
mistaken
and
mislead
others
who
maintain
that
any
degree
of
fear
ought
to
be
a
ground
for
killing
another
to
prevent
his
supposed
intention
it
is
a
very
just
observation
made
by
cicero
in
his
first
book
of
offices
that
many
wrongs
proceed
from
fear
as
when
the
person
who
intends
to
hurt
another
apprehends
some
danger
to
himself
unless
he
took
that
method
clearchus
in
xenophon
says
i
have
known
some
men
who
partly
through
misrepresentation
and
partly
through
suspicion
dreading
one
another
in
order
to
prevent
the
supposed
intentions
of
their
adversaries
have
committed
the
most
enormous
cruelties
against
those
who
neither
designed
nor
wished
them
any
harm
cato
in
his
speech
for
the
rhodians
says
are
we
to
prevent
them
by
doing
first
what
we
say
they
intended
to
do
to
us
on
this
subject
there
is
a
remarkable
passage
in
aulus
gellius
when
a
gladiator
prepares
to
enter
the
lists
for
combat
such
is
his
lot
that
he
must
either
kill
his
adversary
or
be
killed
himself
but
the
life
of
man
is
not
circumscribed
by
the
hard
terms
of
such
an
necessity
as
to
oblige
him
to
do
an
injury
to
prevent
him
from
receiving
one
quintilian
has
quoted
a
passage
from
cicero
wherein
the
orator
asks
whoever
made
such
a
decision
or
to
whom
could
such
a
point
be
yielded
without
the
most
imminent
danger
that
you
have
a
right
to
kill
the
person
by
whom
you
say
you
fear
that
you
shall
afterwards
be
killed
yourself
to
which
this
passage
of
euripides
may
be
applied
if
your
husband
as
you
say
intended
to
have
killed
you
you
ought
to
have
waited
till
he
actually
did
make
the
attempt
conformably
to
which
thucydides
in
the
first
book
of
his
history
has
expressed
himself
in
the
following
terms
the
issue
of
war
is
uncertain
nor
ought
we
to
be
so
far
transported
by
our
fears
as
to
engage
in
immediate
and
open
hostilities
the
same
writer
too
in
his
luminous
description
of
the
dangerous
factions
that
had
arisen
in
the
grecian
states
condemns
the
approbation
bestowed
on
the
person
that
injured
or
destroyed
another
from
whom
he
himself
apprehended
injury
or
destruction
livy
says
men
to
guard
against
their
alarms
make
themselves
objects
of
terror
averting
the
danger
from
their
own
heads
by
imposing
upon
others
the
necessity
of
either
doing
or
suffering
the
evil
which
they
themselves
fear
vibius
asked
a
person
that
appeared
armed
in
the
forum
who
gave
you
permission
to
shew
your
fear
in
this
manner
a
question
not
inapplicable
to
the
present
subject
and
much
commended
by
quintilian
livia
also
in
dion
says
that
great
infamy
redounds
to
those
who
by
anticipation
perpetrate
the
criminal
act
which
they
fear
now
if
any
one
intend
no
immediate
violence
but
is
found
to
have
formed
a
conspiracy
to
destroy
me
by
assassination
or
poison
or
by
false
accusation
perjury
or
suborned
witnesses
i
have
no
right
to
kill
him
for
my
knowledge
of
the
danger
may
prevent
it
or
even
if
it
were
evident
that
i
could
not
avoid
the
danger
without
killing
him
this
would
not
establish
my
right
to
do
so
for
there
is
every
presumption
that
my
knowing
it
will
lead
me
to
apply
for
the
legal
remedies
of
prevention
vi
and
vii
the
next
thing
to
be
considered
is
what
must
be
said
upon
the
mutilation
of
a
limb
now
as
the
loss
of
a
limb
especially
that
of
a
principal
limb
in
the
body
is
a
grievous
detriment
and
nearly
equal
to
the
loss
of
life
to
which
may
be
added
the
probability
of
death
ensuing
from
such
a
calamity
the
lawfulness
of
killing
any
one
who
makes
such
an
attempt
if
the
danger
can
not
otherwise
be
avoided
scarce
admits
of
a
doubt
neither
is
there
any
more
difficulty
in
allowing
the
same
right
for
the
personal
defence
of
chastity
the
preservation
of
which
both
in
the
common
estimation
of
men
and
by
the
divine
law
is
deemed
of
equal
value
with
life
itself
we
have
an
example
of
this
in
cicero
quintilian
and
plutarch
in
the
person
of
one
of
marius
tribunes
who
was
killed
by
a
soldier
among
the
actions
of
women
who
have
defended
themselves
heliodorus
records
that
of
heraclea
which
he
calls
a
just
defence
of
her
injured
honour
viii
though
some
as
it
has
been
already
said
admit
the
lawfulness
of
killing
the
person
who
attempts
with
open
violence
to
destroy
life
yet
they
deem
it
more
commendable
to
spare
the
life
of
another
even
at
the
hazard
of
one
own
yet
to
persons
in
whose
preservation
the
public
interest
is
involved
they
will
grant
an
exemption
from
this
rule
of
forbearance
indeed
it
seems
unsafe
to
impose
upon
any
whose
lives
are
of
importance
to
others
a
rule
of
forebearance
so
contrary
to
all
the
principles
of
all
law
this
exemption
therefore
must
be
allowed
to
all
vested
with
any
public
office
which
makes
them
responsible
for
the
safety
of
others
as
the
generals
who
conduct
armies
or
the
rulers
of
the
state
and
many
others
in
similar
situations
to
whom
may
be
applied
the
lines
of
lucan
when
the
lives
and
safety
of
so
many
nations
depend
upon
yours
and
so
great
a
portion
of
the
world
has
chosen
you
for
its
head
it
is
cruelty
to
expose
yourself
wilfully
to
death
ix
on
the
other
hand
it
may
happen
that
the
aggressor
may
be
one
whose
person
is
rendered
sacred
and
inviolable
by
all
divine
human
and
natural
laws
which
is
the
case
with
respect
to
the
person
of
the
sovereign
for
the
law
of
nature
regards
not
only
the
principles
of
strict
justice
but
comprises
other
virtues
also
as
temperance
fortitude
and
discretion
making
the
observance
of
them
in
certain
cases
binding
as
well
as
honourable
to
observe
these
we
are
bound
also
by
the
law
of
charity
nor
is
the
truth
of
this
argument
at
all
weakened
by
what
vasquez
has
advanced
who
maintains
that
the
sovereign
who
attempts
the
life
of
an
individual
loses
in
reality
the
character
of
sovereign
a
doctrine
fraught
with
equal
absurdity
and
danger
for
sovereignty
can
not
any
more
than
property
be
forfeited
by
any
particular
act
of
delinquency
unless
it
has
been
previously
and
expressly
so
enacted
by
the
fundamental
laws
of
the
state
for
such
a
rule
of
forfeiture
which
would
be
productive
of
universal
anarchy
and
confusion
never
has
been
nor
ever
will
be
established
among
any
civilized
people
for
the
maxim
that
all
government
is
framed
for
the
benefit
of
the
subject
and
not
of
the
sovereign
which
vasquez
and
many
other
writers
lay
down
as
a
fundamental
law
though
it
may
be
generally
true
in
theory
is
by
no
means
applicable
to
the
question
for
a
thing
loses
not
its
existence
by
losing
some
part
of
its
utility
nor
is
there
sufficient
consistency
in
his
observation
that
every
individual
desires
the
safety
of
the
commonwealth
on
his
own
account
and
therefore
every
one
ought
to
prefer
his
own
safety
to
that
of
the
whole
state
for
we
wish
for
the
public
welfare
not
on
our
own
account
alone
but
also
for
the
sake
of
others
the
opinion
of
those
who
think
that
friendship
arises
from
necessity
alone
is
rejected
as
false
by
the
more
sound
philosophers
as
we
feel
a
spontaneous
and
natural
inclination
towards
friendly
intercourse
charity
indeed
often
persuades
and
in
some
instances
commands
us
to
prefer
the
good
of
many
to
our
own
single
advantage
to
which
the
following
passage
from
seneca
is
very
applicable
it
is
not
surprising
that
princes
and
kings
or
whatever
name
the
guardians
of
the
public
welfare
may
bear
should
be
loved
with
a
veneration
and
affection
far
beyond
those
of
private
friendship
for
all
men
of
sober
judgment
and
enlarged
information
deem
the
public
interest
of
higher
moment
than
their
own
their
attachment
therefore
must
be
warmest
to
the
person
on
whom
the
well
being
and
prosperity
of
the
state
depends
and
to
the
same
effect
ambrose
in
his
third
book
of
offices
says
every
man
feels
a
greater
delight
in
averting
public
than
private
danger
seneca
the
writer
already
quoted
produces
two
instances
the
one
of
callistratus
at
athens
and
the
other
of
rutilius
at
rome
who
refused
to
be
restored
from
banishment
thinking
it
better
for
two
individuals
to
suffer
hardship
than
for
the
public
to
be
plunged
into
calamities
xi
the
next
object
to
be
considered
relates
to
injuries
affecting
our
property
in
strict
justice
it
can
not
be
denied
that
we
have
a
right
to
kill
a
robber
if
such
a
step
is
inevitably
necessary
to
the
preservation
of
our
property
for
the
difference
between
the
value
of
life
and
property
is
overbalanced
by
the
horror
which
a
robber
excites
and
by
the
favourable
inclination
felt
by
all
men
towards
the
injured
and
innocent
from
whence
it
follows
that
regarding
that
right
alone
a
robber
may
be
wounded
or
killed
in
his
flight
with
the
property
if
it
can
not
otherwise
be
recovered
demosthenes
in
his
speech
against
aristocrates
exclaims
by
all
that
is
sacred
is
it
not
a
dreadful
and
open
violation
of
law
not
only
of
written
law
but
of
that
law
which
is
the
unwritten
rule
of
all
men
to
be
debarred
from
the
right
of
using
force
against
the
robber
as
well
as
against
the
enemy
who
is
plundering
your
property
nor
is
it
forbidden
by
the
precepts
of
charity
apart
from
all
consideration
of
divine
and
human
law
unless
where
the
property
is
of
little
value
and
beneath
notice
an
exception
which
some
writers
have
very
properly
added
xii
the
sense
of
the
jewish
law
on
this
point
is
now
to
be
considered
the
old
law
of
solon
to
which
demosthenes
in
his
speech
against
timocrates
appeals
agrees
with
it
from
hence
the
substance
of
the
twelve
tables
and
plato
maxim
in
his
ninth
book
of
laws
were
taken
for
they
all
agree
in
making
a
distinction
between
a
thief
who
steals
by
day
and
the
robber
who
commits
the
act
by
night
though
they
differ
about
the
reason
of
this
distinction
some
think
this
distinction
arises
from
the
difficulty
of
discerning
by
night
whether
an
aggressor
comes
with
an
intent
to
murder
or
steal
and
therefore
he
ought
to
be
treated
as
an
assassin
others
think
the
distinction
is
made
because
as
it
is
difficult
to
know
the
person
of
the
thief
there
is
less
probability
of
recovering
the
goods
in
neither
case
do
the
framers
of
laws
seem
to
have
considered
the
question
in
its
proper
light
their
evident
intention
is
to
prohibit
the
killing
of
any
one
merely
on
account
of
our
property
which
would
happen
for
instance
by
killing
a
thief
in
his
flight
in
order
to
recover
the
goods
he
had
stolen
but
if
our
own
lives
are
endangered
then
we
are
allowed
to
avert
the
danger
even
at
the
hazard
of
another
life
nor
is
our
having
run
into
the
danger
any
objection
provided
it
was
done
to
preserve
or
to
recover
our
goods
or
to
take
the
thief
for
no
imputation
of
guilt
can
attach
to
us
in
any
of
these
cases
while
we
are
employed
in
doing
a
lawful
act
nor
can
it
be
said
that
we
are
doing
wrong
to
another
by
exercising
our
own
right
the
difference
therefore
made
between
a
thief
in
the
night
and
a
thief
in
the
day
arises
from
the
difficulty
of
procuring
sufficient
evidence
of
the
fact
so
that
if
a
thief
is
found
killed
the
person
who
says
that
he
was
found
by
him
with
a
destructive
weapon
and
killed
by
him
in
his
own
defence
will
easily
gain
belief
for
the
jewish
law
supposes
this
when
it
treats
of
a
thief
in
the
act
of
piercing
or
as
some
translate
it
with
a
stabbing
instrument
this
interpretation
accords
with
the
law
of
the
twelve
tables
which
forbids
any
one
to
kill
a
thief
in
the
day
time
except
he
defend
himself
with
a
weapon
the
presumption
therefore
against
a
thief
in
the
night
is
that
he
defended
himself
in
such
a
manner
now
the
term
weapon
comprehends
not
only
an
instrument
of
iron
but
as
caius
interprets
this
law
a
club
or
a
stone
ulpian
on
the
other
hand
speaking
of
a
thief
taken
in
the
night
says
that
the
person
who
kills
him
will
incur
no
guilt
provided
that
in
saving
his
property
he
could
not
spare
his
life
without
endangering
his
own
there
is
a
presumption
as
it
has
been
already
observed
in
favour
of
the
person
who
has
killed
a
thief
taken
in
the
night
but
if
there
be
evidence
to
prove
that
the
life
of
the
person
who
killed
the
thief
was
in
no
danger
then
the
presumption
in
his
favour
fails
and
the
act
amounts
to
murder
the
law
of
the
twelve
tables
indeed
required
that
the
person
who
took
a
thief
either
in
the
day
time
or
in
the
night
should
make
a
noise
that
if
possible
the
magistrates
or
neighbours
might
assemble
to
assist
him
and
give
evidence
but
as
such
a
concourse
could
more
easily
be
assembled
in
the
day
time
than
in
the
night
as
ulpian
observes
upon
the
passage
before
quoted
from
demosthenes
the
affirmation
of
a
person
declaring
the
danger
he
was
in
during
the
night
is
more
readily
believed
to
which
an
additional
observation
may
be
made
that
even
under
equal
circumstances
the
danger
which
happens
by
night
can
be
less
examined
and
ascertained
and
therefore
is
the
more
terrible
the
jewish
law
therefore
no
less
than
the
roman
acting
upon
the
same
principle
of
tenderness
forbids
us
to
kill
any
one
who
has
taken
our
goods
unless
for
the
preservation
of
our
own
lives
xvi
what
has
been
already
said
of
the
right
of
defending
our
persons
and
property
though
regarding
chiefly
private
war
may
nevertheless
be
applied
to
public
hostilities
allowing
for
the
difference
of
circumstances
for
private
war
may
be
considered
as
an
instantaneous
exercise
of
natural
right
which
ceases
the
moment
that
legal
redress
can
be
obtained
now
as
public
war
can
never
take
place
but
where
judicial
remedies
cease
to
exist
it
is
often
protracted
and
the
spirit
of
hostility
inflamed
by
the
continued
accession
of
losses
and
injuries
besides
private
war
extends
only
to
whereas
sovereign
powers
have
a
right
not
only
to
avert
but
to
punish
wrongs
from
whence
they
are
authorised
to
prevent
a
remote
as
well
as
an
immediate
aggression
though
the
suspicion
of
hostile
intentions
on
the
part
of
another
power
may
not
justify
the
commencement
of
actual
war
yet
it
calls
for
measures
of
armed
prevention
and
will
authorise
indirect
hostility
points
which
will
be
discussed
in
another
place
xvii
some
writers
have
advanced
a
doctrine
which
can
never
be
admitted
maintaining
that
the
law
of
nations
authorises
one
power
to
commence
hostilities
against
another
whose
increasing
greatness
awakens
her
alarms
as
a
matter
of
expediency
such
a
measure
may
be
adopted
but
the
principles
of
justice
can
never
be
advanced
in
its
favour
the
causes
which
entitle
a
war
to
the
denomination
of
just
are
somewhat
different
from
those
of
expediency
alone
but
to
maintain
that
the
bare
probability
of
some
remote
or
future
annoyance
from
a
neighbouring
state
affords
a
just
ground
of
hostile
aggression
is
a
doctrine
repugnant
to
every
principle
of
equity
such
however
is
the
condition
of
human
life
that
no
full
security
can
be
enjoyed
the
only
protection
against
uncertain
fears
must
be
sought
not
from
violence
but
from
the
divine
providence
and
defensive
precaution
xviii
there
is
another
opinion
not
more
admissible
maintaining
that
the
hostile
acts
of
an
aggressor
may
be
considered
in
the
light
of
defensive
measures
because
say
the
advocates
of
this
opinion
few
people
are
content
to
proportion
their
revenge
to
the
injuries
they
have
received
bounds
which
in
all
probability
the
party
aggrieved
has
exceeded
and
therefore
in
return
becomes
himself
the
aggressor
now
the
excess
of
retaliation
can
not
any
more
than
the
fear
of
uncertain
danger
give
a
colour
of
right
to
the
first
aggression
which
may
be
illustrated
by
the
case
of
a
malefactor
who
can
have
no
right
to
wound
or
kill
the
officers
of
justice
in
their
attempts
to
take
him
urging
as
a
plea
that
he
feared
the
punishment
would
exceed
the
offense
the
first
step
which
an
aggressor
ought
to
take
should
be
an
offer
of
indemnity
to
the
injured
party
by
the
arbitration
of
some
independent
and
disinterested
state
and
if
this
mediation
be
rejected
then
his
war
assumes
the
character
of
a
just
war
thus
hezekiah
when
he
had
not
stood
to
the
engagements
made
by
his
ancestors
being
threatened
with
an
attack
from
the
king
of
assyria
on
that
account
acknowledged
his
fault
and
left
it
to
the
king
to
assign
what
penalty
he
should
pay
for
the
offence
after
he
had
done
so
finding
himself
again
attacked
relying
on
the
justice
of
his
cause
he
opposed
the
enemy
and
succeeded
by
the
favour
of
god
pontius
the
samnite
after
restoration
of
the
prizes
had
been
made
to
the
romans
and
the
promoter
of
the
war
delivered
up
into
their
hands
said
we
have
now
averted
the
wrath
of
heaven
which
our
violation
of
treaties
had
provoked
but
the
supreme
being
who
was
pleased
to
reduce
us
to
the
necessity
of
restoration
was
not
equally
pleased
with
the
pride
of
the
romans
who
rejected
our
offer
what
farther
satisfaction
do
we
owe
to
the
romans
or
to
heaven
the
arbiter
of
treaties
we
do
not
shrink
from
submitting
the
measure
of
your
resentment
or
of
our
punishment
to
the
judgment
of
any
people
or
any
individual
in
the
same
manner
when
the
thebans
had
offered
the
most
equitable
terms
to
the
lacedaemonians
who
still
rose
higher
in
their
demands
aristides
says
that
the
justice
of
the
cause
changed
sides
and
passed

the

to
the

assigned
to

we
may
reckon
the

of

particularly
such
as
affects
any

which
belongs

now
we
establish
this
claim
to
any

as
our
own
either
by
a
right
common
to
us
as
men
or
acquired
by
us
in
our
individual
capacity
but
to
begin
with
that
which
is
the
common
right
of
all
mankind
we
may
observe
that
it
comprises
what
is
called
by
legal
authorities
corporeal
and
incorporeal
rights
things
corporeal
are
either
unappropriated
or
made
the
subjects
of
private
property
now
the
things
unappropriated
are
such
that
it
may
be
either
possible
or
impossible
for
them
to
be
reduced
to
a
state
of
private
property
in
order
therefore
to
understand
this
more
clearly
it
will
be
necessary
to
take
a
survey
of
the
origin
of
property
ii
god
gave
to
mankind
in
general
dominion
over
all
the
creatures
of
the
earth
from
the
first
creation
of
the
world
a
grant
which
was
renewed
upon
the
restoration
of
the
world
after
the
deluge
all
things
as
justin
says
formed
a
common
stock
for
all
mankind
as
the
inheritors
of
one
general
patrimony
from
hence
it
happened
that
every
man
seized
to
his
own
use
or
consumption
whatever
he
met
with
a
general
exercise
of
a
right
which
supplied
the
place
of
private
property
so
that
to
deprive
any
one
of
what
he
had
thus
seized
became
an
act
of
injustice
which
cicero
has
explained
in
his
third
book
on
the
bounds
of
good
and
evil
by
comparing
the
world
to
a
theatre
in
which
the
seats
are
common
property
yet
every
spectator
claims
that
which
he
occupies
for
the
time
being
as
his
own
a
state
of
affairs
which
could
not
subsist
but
in
the
greatest
simplicity
of
manners
and
under
the
mutual
forbearance
and
of
mankind
an
example
of
a
community
of
goods
arising
from
extreme
simplicity
of
manners
may
be
seen
in
some
nations
of
america
who
for
many
ages
have
subsisted
in
this
manner
without
inconvenience
the
essenes
of
old
furnished
an
example
of
men
actuated
by
mutual
affection
and
holding
all
things
in
common
a
practice
adopted
by
the
primitive
christians
at
jerusalem
and
still
prevailing
among
some
of
the
religious
orders
man
at
his
first
origin
requiring
no
clothing
afforded
a
proof
of
the
simplicity
of
manners
in
which
he
had
been
formed
yet
perhaps
as
justin
says
of
the
scythians
he
might
be
considered
as
ignorant
of
vice
rather
than
acquainted
with
virtue
tacitus
says
that
in
the
early
ages
of
the
world
men
lived
free
from
the
influence
of
evil
passions
without
reproach
and
wickedness
and
consequently
without
the
restraints
of
punishment
in
primitive
times
there
appeared
among
mankind
according
to
macrobius
a
simplicity
ignorant
of
evil
and
inexperienced
in
craft
a
simplicity
which
in
the
book
of
wisdom
seems
to
be
called
integrity
and
by
the
apostle
paul
simplicity
in
opposition
to
subtilty
their
sole
employment
was
the
worship
of
god
of
which
the
tree
of
life
was
the
symbol
as
it
is
explained
by
the
ancient
hebrews
whose
opinion
is
confirmed
by
the
book
of
revelation
men
at
that
period
subsisted
upon
the
spontaneous
productions
of
the
ground
a
state
of
simplicity
to
which
they
did
not
long
adhere
but
applied
themselves
to
the
invention
of
various
arts
indicated
by
the
tree
of
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
that
is
the
knowledge
of
those
things
which
may
be
either
used
properly
or
abused
which
philo
calls
a
middle
kind
of
wisdom
in
this
view
solomon
says
god
hath
created
men
upright
that
is
in
simplicity
but
they
have
sought
out
many
inventions
or
in
the
language
of
philo
they
have
inclined
to
subtilty
in
the
sixth
oration
of
dion
prusaeensis
it
is
said
the
descendants
have
degenerated
from
the
innocence
of
primitive
times
contriving
many
subtile
inventions
no
way
conducive
to
the
good
of
life
and
using
their
strength
not
to
promote
justice
but
to
gratify
their
appetites
agriculture
and
pasturage
seem
to
have
been
the
most
ancient
pursuits
which
characterized
the
first
brothers
some
distribution
of
things
would
necessarily
follow
these
different
states
and
we
are
informed
by
holy
writ
that
the
rivalry
thus
created
ended
in
murder
at
length
men
increasing
in
wickedness
by
their
evil
communications
with
each
other
the
race
of
giants
that
is
of
strong
and
violent
men
appeared
whom
the
greeks
denominate
by
a
title
signifying
those
who
make
their
own
hands
and
strength
the
measure
of
justice
the
world
in
progress
of
time
being
cleared
of
this
race
by
the
deluge
the
savage
was
succeeded
by
a
softer
and
more
sensual
way
of
life
to
which
the
use
of
wine
proved
subservient
being
followed
by
all
the
evil
consequences
of
intoxication
but
the
greatest
breach
in
the
harmony
of
men
was
made
by
ambition
which
is
considered
in
some
measure
as
the
offspring
of
a
noble
mind
its
first
and
most
eminent
effects
appeared
in
the
attempt
to
raise
the
tower
of
babel
the
failure
of
which
caused
the
dispersion
of
mankind
who
took
possession
of
different
parts
of
the
earth
still
after
this
a
community
of
lands
for
pasture
though
not
of
flocks
prevailed
among
men
for
the
great
extent
of
land
was
sufficient
for
the
use
of
all
occupants
as
yet
but
few
in
number
without
their
incommoding
each
other
in
the
words
of
the
poet
it
was
deemed
unlawful
to
fix
a
land
mark
on
the
plain
or
to
apportion
it
out
in
stated
limits
but
as
men
increased
in
numbers
and
their
flocks
in
the
same
proportion
they
could
no
longer
with
convenience
enjoy
the
use
of
lands
in
common
and
it
became
necessary
to
divide
them
into
allotments
for
each
family
now
in
the
hot
countries
of
the
east
wells
would
be
objects
of
great
importance
for
the
refreshment
of
their
herds
and
flocks
so
that
in
order
to
avoid
strife
and
inconvenience
all
would
be
anxious
to
have
them
as
possessions
of
their
own
these
accounts
we
derive
from
sacred
history
and
they
are
found
to
agree
with
the
opinions
maintained
upon
this
subject
by
philosophers
and
poets
who
have
described
the
community
of
goods
that
prevailed
in
the
early
state
of
the
world
and
the
distribution
of
property
which
afterwards
took
place
hence
a
notion
may
be
formed
of
the
reason
why
men
departed
from
the
primaeval
state
of
holding
all
things
in
common
attaching
the
ideas
of
property
first
to
moveable
and
next
to
immoveable
things
when
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
began
to
acquire
a
taste
for
more
delicate
fare
than
the
spontaneous
productions
of
the
ground
and
to
look
for
more
commodious
habitations
than
caves
or
the
hollow
of
trees
and
to
long
for
more
elegant
cloathing
than
the
skins
of
wild
beasts
industry
became
necessary
to
supply
those
wants
and
each
individual
began
to
apply
his
attention
to
some
particular
art
the
distance
of
the
places
too
into
which
men
were
dispersed
prevented
them
from
carrying
the
fruits
of
the
earth
to
a
common
stock
and
in
the
next
place
the
want
of
just
principle
and
equitable
kindness
would
destroy
that
equality
which
ought
to
subsist
both
in
the
labour
of
producing
and
consuming
the
necessaries
of
life
at
the
same
time
we
learn
how
things
passed
from
being
held
in
common
to
a
state
of
property
it
was
not
by
the
act
of
the
mind
alone
that
this
change
took
place
for
men
in
that
case
could
never
know
what
others
intended
to
appropriate
to
their
own
use
so
as
to
exclude
the
claim
of
every
other
pretender
to
the
same
and
many
too
might
desire
to
possess
the
same
thing
property
therefore
must
have
been
established
either
by
express
agreement
as
by
division
or
by
tacit
consent
as
by
occupancy
for
as
soon
as
it
was
found
inconvenient
to
hold
things
in
common
before
any
division
of
lands
had
been
established
it
is
natural
to
suppose
it
must
have
been
generally
agreed
that
whatever
any
one
had
occupied
should
be
accounted
his
own
cicero
in
the
third
book
of
his
offices
says
it
is
admitted
as
an
universal
maxim
not
repugnant
to
the
principles
of
natural
law
that
every
one
should
rather
wish
himself
to
enjoy
the
necessaries
of
life
than
leave
them
for
the
acquisition
of
another
which
is
supported
by
quintilian
who
says
if
the
condition
of
life
be
such
that
whatever
has
fallen
to
the
private
use
of
any
individual
becomes
the
property
of
such
holder
it
is
evidently
unjust
to
take
away
any
thing
which
is
possessed
by
such
a
right
and
the
ancients
in
styling
ceres
a
and
giving
the
name
of
thesmophoria
to
her
sacred
rights
meant
by
this
to
signify
that
the
division
of
lands
had
given
birth
to
a
new
kind
of
right
iii
notwithstanding
the
statements
above
made
it
must
be
admitted
that
some
things
are
impossible
to
be
reduced
to
a
state
of
property
of
which
the
sea
affords
us
an
instance
both
in
its
general
extent
and
in
its
principal
branches
but
as
some
are
willing
to
make
this
concession
with
regard
to
individuals
but
not
with
regard
to
nations
the
position
advanced
in
the
beginning
of
this
section
may
be
proved
from
the
following
moral
argument
that
as
in
this
case
the
reason
no
longer
subsists
why
men
should
hold
all
things
in
common
the
practice
ceases
also
for
the
magnitude
of
the
sea
is
such
as
to
be
sufficient
for
the
use
of
all
nations
to
allow
them
without
inconvenience
and
prejudice
to
each
other
the
right
of
fishing
sailing
or
any
other
advantage
which
that
element
affords
the
same
may
be
said
of
air
as
common
property
except
that
no
one
can
use
or
enjoy
it
without
at
the
same
time
using
the
ground
over
which
it
passes
or
rests
so
that
the
amusement
of
fowling
can
not
be
followed
except
by
permission
without
trespassing
upon
the
lands
of
some
owner
over
which
the
birds
fly
the
same
appellation
of
common
may
be
given
to
the
sand
of
the
shore
which
being
incapable
of
cultivation
is
left
free
to
yield
its
inexhaustible
supplies
for
the
use
of
all
there
is
a
natural
reason
also
which
renders
the
sea
considered
in
the
view
already
taken
incapable
of
being
made
property
because
occupancy
can
never
subsist
but
in
things
that
can
be
confined
to
certain
permanent
bounds
from
whence
thucydides
gives
the
name
of
infinite
space
to
unoccupied
lands
and
isocrates
speaking
of
that
occupied
by
the
athenians
calls
it
that
which
has
been
measured
by
us
into
alloted
parts
but
fluids
which
can
not
be
limited
or
restrained
except
they
be
contained
within
some
other
substance
can
not
be
occupied
thus
ponds
and
lakes
and
rivers
likewise
can
only
be
made
property
as
far
as
they
are
confined
within
certain
banks
but
the
ocean
as
it
is
equal
to
or
larger
than
the
earth
can
not
be
confined
within
the
land
so
that
the
ancients
said
the
earth
was
bounded
in
by
the
sea
like
a
girdle
surrounding
it
nor
can
any
imaginable
division
of
it
have
been
originally
framed
for
as
the
greatest
part
of
it
was
unknown
it
was
impossible
that
nations
far
removed
from
each
other
could
agree
upon
the
bounds
to
be
assigned
to
different
parts
whatever
therefore
was
the
common
property
of
all
and
after
a
general
division
of
all
other
things
retained
its
original
state
could
not
be
appropriated
by
division
but
by
occupancy
and
the
marks
of
distinction
and
separation
by
which
its
different
parts
were
known
followed
such
appropriation
iv
the
next
matters
to
be
noticed
are
those
things
which
though
not
yet
made
property
may
be
reduced
to
that
condition
under
this
description
come
waste
lands
desert
islands
wild
beasts
fishes
and
birds
now
in
these
cases
there
are
two
things
to
be
pointed
out
which
are
a
double
kind
of
occupancy
that
may
take
place
the
one
in
the
name
of
the
sovereign
or
of
a
whole
people
the
other
by
individuals
converting
into
private
estates
the
lands
which
they
have
so
occupied
the
latter
kind
of
individual
property
proceeds
rather
from
assignment
than
from
free
occupancy
yet
any
places
that
have
been
taken
possession
of
in
the
name
of
a
sovereign
or
of
a
whole
people
though
not
portioned
out
amongst
individuals
are
not
to
be
considered
as
waste
lands
but
as
the
property
of
the
first
occupier
whether
it
be
the
king
or
a
whole
people
of
this
description
are
rivers
lakes
forests
and
wild
mountains
as
to
wild
beasts
fishes
and
birds
it
is
to
be
observed
that
the
sovereign
of
the
respective
lands
or
waters
where
they
are
found
has
a
legal
right
to
prohibit
any
one
from
taking
them
and
thereby
acquiring
a
property
in
them
a
prohibition
extending
to
foreigners
as
well
as
subjects
to
foreigners
because
by
all
the
rules
of
moral
law
they
owe
obedience
to
the
sovereign
for
the
time
during
which
they
reside
in
his
territories
nor
is
there
any
validity
in
the
objection
founded
on
the
roman
law
the
law
of
nature
or
the
law
of
nations
which
it
is
said
declare
such
animals
to
be
beasts
of
chace
free
to
every
one
hunting
for
this
is
only
true
where
there
is
no
civil
law
to
interpose
its
prohibition
as
the
roman
law
left
many
things
in
their
primitive
state
which
by
other
nations
were
placed
upon
a
very
different
footing
the
deviations
therefore
from
the
state
of
nature
which
have
been
established
by
the
civil
law
are
ordained
by
every
principle
of
natural
justice
to
be
obeyed
by
mankind
for
although
the
civil
law
can
enjoin
nothing
which
the
law
of
nature
prohibits
nor
prohibit
any
thing
which
it
enjoins
yet
it
may
circumscribe
natural
liberty
restraining
what
was
before
allowed
although
the
restraint
should
extend
to
the
very
acquisition
of
property
to
which
every
man
at
first
had
a
right
by
the
law
of
nature
vi
the
next
thing
to
be
considered
is
the
right
which
men
have
to
the
common
use
of
things
already
appropriated
terms
in
which
at
the
first
sight
there
appears
to
be
some
inconsistency
as
it
appears
that
the
establishment
of
property
has
absorbed
every
right
that
sprung
from
a
state
of
things
held
in
common
but
this
is
by
no
means
the
case
for
the
intention
of
those
who
first
introduce
private
property
must
be
taken
into
the
account
and
it
was
but
reasonable
to
suppose
that
in
making
this
introduction
of
property
they
would
depart
as
little
as
possible
from
the
original
principles
of
natural
equity
for
if
written
laws
are
to
be
construed
in
a
sense
approaching
as
nearly
as
possible
to
the
laws
of
nature
much
more
so
are
those
customs
which
are
not
fettered
with
the
literal
restrictions
of
written
maxims
from
hence
it
follows
that
in
cases
of
extreme
necessity
the
original
right
of
using
things
as
if
they
had
remained
in
common
must
be
revived
because
in
all
human
laws
and
consequently
in
the
laws
relating
to
property
the
case
of
extreme
necessity
seems
to
form
an
exception
upon
this
principle
is
built
the
maxim
that
if
in
a
voyage
provisions
begin
to
fail
the
stock
of
every
individual
ought
to
be
produced
for
common
consumption
for
the
same
reason
a
neighbouring
house
may
be
pulled
down
to
stop
the
progress
of
a
fire
or
the
cables
or
nets
in
which
a
ship
is
entangled
may
be
cut
if
it
can
not
otherwise
be
disengaged
maxims
none
of
which
were
introduced
by
the
civil
law
but
only
explained
by
it
according
to
the
rules
of
natural
equity
now
among
theologians
also
it
is
a
received
opinion
that
if
in
urgent
distress
any
one
shall
take
from
another
what
is
absolutely
necessary
for
the
preservation
of
his
own
life
the
act
shall
not
be
deemed
a
theft
a
rule
not
founded
as
some
allege
solely
upon
the
law
of
charity
which
obliges
every
possessor
to
apply
some
part
of
his
wealth
to
relieve
the
needy
but
upon
the
original
division
of
lands
among
private
owners
which
was
made
with
a
reservation
in
favour
of
the
primitive
rights
of
nature
for
if
those
who
at
first
made
the
division
had
been
asked
their
opinion
upon
this
point
they
would
have
given
the
same
reason
that
has
just
been
advanced
necessity
says
seneca
the
great
protectress
of
human
infirmity
breaks
through
all
human
laws
and
all
those
made
in
the
spirit
of
human
regulations
cicero
in
his
eleventh
philippic
says
that
cassius
went
into
syria
which
might
be
considered
as
another
province
if
men
adhered
to
written
laws
but
if
these
were
abolished
it
would
be
considered
as
his
own
by
the
law
of
nature
in
the
sixth
book
and
fourth
chapter
of
quintus
curtius
we
find
an
observation
that
in
a
common
calamity
every
man
looks
to
himself
vii
now
this
indulgence
must
be
granted
with
precautions
and
restrictions
to
prevent
it
from
degenerating
into
licentiousness
and
of
these
precautions
the
first
requires
the
distressed
party
to
try
every
mode
of
obtaining
relief
by
an
appeal
to
a
magistrate
or
by
trying
the
effect
of
entreaty
to
prevail
upon
the
owner
to
grant
what
is
necessary
for
his
pressing
occasions
plato
allows
any
one
to
seek
water
from
his
neighbour
well
after
having
dug
to
a
certain
depth
in
his
own
without
effect
solon
limits
the
depth
to
forty
cubits
upon
which
plutarch
remarks
that
he
intended
by
this
to
relieve
necessity
and
difficulty
but
not
to
encourage
sloth
xenophon
in
his
answer
to
the
sinopians
in
the
fifth
book
of
the
expedition
of
cyrus
says
wherever
we
come
whether
into
a
barbarous
country
or
into
any
part
of
greece
and
find
the
people
unwilling
to
afford
us
supplies
we
take
them
not
through
motives
of
wantonness
but
from
the
compulsion
of
necessity
viii
in
the
next
place
this
plea
of
necessity
can
not
be
admitted
where
the
possessor
is
in
an
equal
state
of
necessity
himself
for
under
equal
circumstances
the
owner
has
a
better
right
to
the
use
of
his
possessions
though
lactantius
maintains
that
it
is
no
mark
of
folly
to
forbear
thrusting
another
from
the
same
plank
in
a
shipwreck
in
order
to
save
yourself
because
you
have
thereby
avoided
hurting
another
a
sin
which
is
certainly
a
proof
of
wisdom
to
abstain
from
cicero
in
the
third
book
of
his
offices
asks
this
question
if
a
wise
man
in
danger
of
perishing
with
hunger
has
not
a
right
to
take
the
provisions
of
another
who
is
good
for
nothing
to
which
he
replies
by
no
means
for
no
one
life
can
be
of
such
importance
as
to
authorize
the
violation
of
that
general
rule
of
forbearance
by
which
the
peace
and
safety
of
every
individual
are
secured
ix
in
the
third
place
the
party
thus
supplying
his
wants
from
the
property
of
another
is
bound
to
make
restitution
or
give
an
equivalent
to
the
owner
whenever
that
is
possible
there
are
some
indeed
who
deny
this
upon
the
ground
that
no
one
is
bound
to
give
an
indemnity
for
having
exercised
his
own
right
but
strictly
speaking
it
was
not
a
full
and
perfect
right
which
he
exercised
but
a
kind
of
permission
arising
out
of
a
case
of
necessity
and
existing
no
longer
than
while
the
necessity
continued
for
such
a
permissive
right
is
only
granted
in
order
to
preserve
natural
equity
in
opposition
to
the
strict
and
churlish
rigour
of
exclusive
ownership
x
hence
it
may
be
inferred
that
in
the
prosecution
of
a
just
war
any
power
has
a
right
to
take
possession
of
a
neutral
soil
if
there
be
real
grounds
and
not
imaginary
fears
for
supposing
the
enemy
intends
to
make
himself
master
of
the
same
especially
if
the
enemy
occupying
it
would
be
attended
with
imminent
and
irreparable
mischief
to
that
same
power
but
in
this
case
the
restriction
is
applied
that
nothing
be
taken
but
what
is
actually
necessary
to
such
precaution
and
security
barely
occupying
the
place
is
all
that
can
be
justified
leaving
to
the
real
owner
the
full
enjoyment
of
all
his
rights
immunities
and
jurisdiction
and
all
the
productions
of
his
soil
and
this
must
be
done
too
with
the
full
intention
of
restoring
the
place
to
its
lawful
sovereign
whenever
the
necessity
for
which
it
was
occupied
may
cease
the
retaining
of
enna
livy
says
was
either
an
act
of
violence
or
a
necessary
measure
by
violence
meaning
the
least
departure
from
necessity
the
greeks
who
were
with
xenophon
being
in
great
want
of
ships
by
xenophon
own
advice
seized
upon
those
that
were
passing
still
preserving
the
property
untouched
for
the
owners
supplying
the
sailors
with
provisions
and
paying
them
wages
the
principal
right
therefore
founded
upon
the
original
community
of
goods
remaining
since
the
introduction
of
property
is
that
of
necessity
which
has
just
been
discussed
xi
there
is
another
right
which
is
that
of
making
use
of
the
property
of
another
where
such
use
is
attended
with
no
prejudice
to
the
owner
for
why
says
cicero
should
not
any
one
when
he
can
do
it
without
injury
to
himself
allow
another
to
share
with
him
those
advantages
which
are
useful
to
the
receiver
and
no
way
detrimental
to
the
giver
seneca
therefore
observes
that
it
is
no
favour
to
allow
another
to
light
his
fire
from
your
flame
and
in
the
book
of
symposiacs
we
find
an
observation
that
when
we
have
provisions
more
than
sufficient
for
our
own
consumption
it
is
wicked
to
destroy
the
remainder
or
after
supplying
our
own
wants
to
obstruct
or
destroy
the
springs
of
water
or
after
having
finished
our
voyage
not
to
leave
for
other
passengers
the
that
have
enabled
us
to
steer
our
course
xii
upon
the
principles
already
established
a
river
as
such
is
the
property
of
that
people
or
of
the
sovereign
of
that
people
through
whose
territories
it
flows
he
may
form
quays
and
buttresses
upon
that
river
and
to
him
all
the
produce
of
it
belongs
but
the
same
river
as
a
running
water
still
remains
common
to
all
to
draw
or
drink
it
ovid
introduces
latona
thus
addressing
the
lydians
why
do
you
refuse
water
the
use
of
which
is
common
where
he
calls
water
a
public
gift
that
is
common
to
men
taking
the
word
public
in
a
more
general
sense
than
as
applied
to
any
people
a
meaning
in
which
some
things
are
said
to
be
public
by
the
law
of
nations
and
in
the
same
sense
virgil
has
asserted
water
to
be
free
and
open
to
all
men
xiii
it
is
upon
the
same
foundation
of
common
right
that
a
free
passage
through
countries
rivers
or
over
any
part
of
the
sea
which
belongs
to
some
particular
people
ought
to
be
allowed
to
those
who
require
it
for
the
necessary
occasions
of
life
whether
those
occasions
be
in
quest
of
settlements
after
being
driven
from
their
own
country
or
to
trade
with
a
remote
nation
or
to
recover
by
just
war
their
lost
possessions
the
same
reason
prevails
here
as
in
the
cases
above
named
because
property
was
originally
introduced
with
a
reservation
of
that
use
which
might
be
of
general
benefit
and
not
prejudicial
to
the
interest
of
the
owner
an
intention
evidently
entertained
by
those
who
first
devised
the
separation
of
the
bounteous
gifts
of
the
creator
into
private
possessions
there
is
a
remarkable
instance
of
this
in
the
mosaic
history
when
the
leader
of
the
children
of
israel
required
a
free
passage
for
that
people
promising
to
the
king
of
edom
and
to
the
king
of
the
amorites
that
he
would
go
by
the
highway
without
setting
a
foot
upon
the
soil
of
private
possessions
and
that
the
people
should
pay
the
price
of
everything
which
they
might
have
occasion
to
use
upon
these
equitable
terms
being
rejected
moses
was
justified
in
making
war
upon
the
amorites
because
says
augustin
an
inoffensive
passage
a
right
interwoven
with
the
very
frame
of
human
society
was
refused
the
greeks
under
the
command
of
clearchus
said
we
are
upon
the
way
to
our
home
if
no
one
interrupt
us
but
every
attempt
to
molest
us
we
are
with
the
assistance
of
heaven
determined
to
avenge
not
unlike
this
answer
of
the
soldiers
under
clearchus
is
the
question
put
to
the
different
nations
of
thrace
by
agesilaus
who
desired
to
know
whether
they
wished
him
to
pass
through
their
country
as
a
friend
or
as
an
enemy
when
the
boeotians
hesitated
upon
some
propositions
made
to
them
by
lysander
he
asked
them
whether
they
intended
that
he
should
pass
with
erected
or
inclined
spears
meaning
by
the
expression
in
a
hostile
or
a
quiet
manner
we
are
informed
by
tacitus
that
the
batavians
as
soon
as
they
came
near
the
camp
at
bonn
sent
a
message
to
herennius
gallus
importing
that
they
had
no
hostile
design
that
if
not
obstructed
they
would
march
in
a
peaceable
manner
but
if
they
met
with
opposition
they
would
cut
their
way
sword
in
hand
when
cimon
in
carrying
supplies
to
the
lacedaemonians
had
marched
with
his
troops
through
some
part
of
the
corinthian
district
the
corinthians
expostulated
upon
his
conduct
as
a
violation
of
their
territory
because
he
had
done
it
without
asking
their
leave
at
the
same
time
observing
that
no
one
knocks
at
another
man
door
or
presumes
to
enter
the
house
without
obtaining
the
master
leave
to
whom
he
replied
you
never
knocked
at
the
gates
of
cleone
and
megara
but
broke
them
down
believing
i
suppose
that
no
right
ought
to
withstand
the
force
of
the
mighty
now
between
these
two
extremes
there
is
a
middle
course
requiring
a
free
passage
to
be
first
asked
the
refusal
of
which
will
justify
the
application
of
force
thus
agesilaus
in
his
return
from
asia
when
he
had
asked
a
passage
of
the
king
of
the
macedonians
who
answered
that
he
would
consider
of
it
said
you
may
consider
if
you
please
but
we
shall
pass
in
the
mean
time
the
fears
which
any
power
entertains
from
a
multitude
in
arms
passing
through
its
territories
do
not
form
such
an
exception
as
can
do
away
the
rule
already
laid
down
for
it
is
not
proper
or
reasonable
that
the
fears
of
one
party
should
destroy
the
rights
of
another
especially
as
necessary
precautions
and
securities
may
be
used
such
as
those
for
instance
of
requiring
that
the
troops
shall
pass
without
arms
or
in
small
bodies
a
promise
which
the
agrippinians
made
to
the
germans
and
as
we
are
informed
by
strabo
the
practice
still
prevails
in
the
country
of
the
eleans
another
security
may
be
found
in
providing
garrisons
at
the
expense
of
the
party
to
whom
the
passage
is
granted
or
in
giving
hostages
the
condition
which
seleucus
demanded
of
demetrius
for
permitting
him
to
remain
within
his
territories
nor
is
the
fear
of
offending
that
power
which
is
the
object
of
attack
a
sufficient
pretext
for
refusing
the
passage
of
the
troops
to
the
state
that
is
engaged
in
a
just
war
nor
is
it
a
proper
reason
to
assign
for
a
refusal
to
say
that
another
passage
may
be
found
as
every
other
power
might
allege
the
same
and
by
this
means
the
right
of
passage
would
be
entirely
defeated
the
request
of
a
passage
therefore
by
the
nearest
and
most
commodious
way
without
doing
injury
and
mischief
is
a
sufficient
ground
upon
which
it
should
be
granted
it
alters
the
case
entirely
if
the
party
making
the
request
is
engaged
in
unjust
war
and
is
marching
with
the
troops
of
a
power
hostile
to
the
sovereign
of
that
territory
for
in
this
instance
a
passage
may
be
refused
for
the
sovereign
has
a
right
to
attack
that
power
in
his
own
territory
and
to
oppose
its
march
now
a
free
passage
ought
to
be
allowed
not
only
to
persons
but
to
merchandise
for
no
power
has
a
right
to
prevent
one
nation
from
trading
with
another
at
a
remote
distance
a
permission
which
for
the
interest
of
society
should
be
maintained
nor
can
it
be
said
that
any
one
is
injured
by
it
for
though
he
may
be
thereby
deprived
of
an
exclusive
gain
yet
the
loss
of
what
is
not
his
due
as
a
matter
of
right
can
never
be
considered
as
a
damage
or
the
violation
of
a
claim
xiv
but
it
will
form
a
subject
of
inquiry
whether
the
sovereign
of
the
country
has
a
right
to
impose
duties
on
goods
carried
by
land
or
upon
a
river
or
upon
any
part
of
the
sea
which
may
form
an
accession
to
his
dominions
it
would
undoubtedly
be
unjust
for
any
burdens
foreign
to
the
nature
of
trade
to
be
imposed
upon
such
goods
thus
strangers
merely
passing
through
a
country
would
have
no
right
to
pay
a
imposed
to
support
the
exigencies
of
the
state
but
if
the
sovereign
incurs
expence
by
providing
security
and
protection
to
trade
he
has
a
right
to
reimburse
himself
by
the
imposition
of
moderate
and
reasonable
duties
it
is
the
reasonableness
of
them
which
constitutes
the
justice
of
customs
and
taxes
thus
solomon
received
tolls
for
horses
and
linen
that
passed
over
the
isthmus
of
syria
pliny
speaking
of
frankincense
observes
that
as
it
could
not
be
transported
but
by
the
gebanites
a
duty
upon
it
was
paid
to
their
king
in
the
same
manner
as
strabo
informs
us
in
his
fourth
book
the
people
of
marseilles
derived
great
wealth
from
the
canal
which
marius
had
made
from
the
rhone
to
the
sea
by
exacting
tribute
of
all
that
sailed
upon
it
to
and
fro
with
vessels
in
the
eighth
book
of
the
same
writer
we
are
told
that
the
corinthians
imposed
a
duty
upon
all
goods
which
to
avoid
the
dangerous
passage
of
cape
malea
were
transported
by
land
from
sea
to
sea
the
romans
too
made
the
passage
of
the
rhine
a
source
of
tribute
and
seneca
relates
that
a
toll
was
paid
for
going
over
bridges
the
works
of
legal
writers
abound
in
instances
of
this
kind
but
it
frequently
happens
that
extortion
is
practised
in
these
matters
which
strabo
forms
into
a
subject
of
complaint
against
chiefs
of
the
arabian
tribes
concluding
that
it
would
be
unlikely
for
men
of
that
lawless
kind
to
impose
upon
the
goods
of
merchants
any
duties
that
were
not
oppressive
xv
those
going
with
merchandise
or
only
passing
through
a
country
ought
to
be
allowed
to
reside
there
for
a
time
if
the
recovery
of
health
or
any
other
just
cause
should
render
such
residence
necessary
for
these
may
be
reckoned
among
the
innocent
uses
of
our
right
thus
ilioneus
in
virgil
calls
heaven
to
witness
the
injustice
of
the
africans
in
driving
him
and
his
shipwrecked
companions
from
the
hospitable
use
of
the
shore
and
we
are
informed
by
plutarch
in
his
life
of
pericles
that
all
the
grecians
approved
of
the
complaint
which
the
megarensians
made
against
the
athenians
who
had
prohibited
them
from
setting
foot
upon
the
soil
of
their
territories
or
carrying
a
vessel
into
their
harbours
so
the
lacedaemonians
regarded
this
as
the
most
sufficient
grounds
to
justify
the
war
from
hence
results
the
right
of
erecting
a
temporary
hut
upon
the
shore
although
for
instance
the
same
shore
is
allowed
to
be
the
property
of
the
people
of
that
place
for
what
pomponius
says
of
its
being
necessary
to
obtain
the
praetor
leave
before
a
building
can
be
raised
upon
the
public
shore
relates
to
structures
of
a
permanent
kind
when
the
massy
piles
of
stone
as
the
poet
says
encroach
upon
the
sea
and
the
affrighted
fish
feel
their
waves
contracted
xvi
nor
ought
a
permanent
residence
to
be
refused
to
foreigners
who
driven
from
their
own
country
seek
a
place
or
refuge
but
then
it
is
only
upon
condition
that
they
submit
to
the
established
laws
of
the
place
and
avoid
every
occasion
of
exciting
tumult
and
sedition
a
reasonable
rule
which
the
divine
poet
has
observed
when
he
introduces
aeneas
making
an
offer
that
latinus
who
had
become
his
should
retain
all
military
and
civil
power
and
in
dionysius
of
halicarnassus
latinus
admits
the
proposal
of
aeneas
to
be
just
as
he
came
through
necessity
in
quest
of
a
settlement
to
drive
away
refugees
says
strabo
from
eratosthenes
is
acting
like
barbarians
and
a
conduct
like
this
in
the
spartans
was
also
condemned
ambrose
passes
the
same
sentence
of
condemnation
upon
those
powers
who
refuse
all
admission
to
strangers
yet
settlers
of
this
description
have
no
right
to
demand
a
share
in
the
government
a
proposal
of
this
kind
made
by
the
minyae
to
the
lacedaemonians
who
had
received
them
is
very
properly
considered
by
herodotus
as
insolent
and
unreasonable
xvii
it
is
indeed
but
an
act
of
common
humanity
in
a
sovereign
to
allow
strangers
at
their
request
liberty
to
fix
their
residence
upon
any
waste
or
barren
lands
within
his
dominions
still
reserving
to
himself
all
the
rights
of
sovereignty
seven
hundred
acres
of
barren
and
uncultivated
land
as
servius
observes
were
given
by
the
native
latins
to
the
trojans
dion
prusaeensis
in
his
seventh
oration
says
that
they
commit
no
crime
of
trespass
who
take
upon
them
to
cultivate
waste
lands
the
refusal
of
this
privilege
made
the
ansibarians
exclaim
the
firmament
over
our
heads
is
the
mansion
of
the
deity
the
earth
was
given
to
man
and
what
remains
unoccupied
lies
in
common
to
all
yet
that
complaint
did
not
apply
exactly
to
their
case
for
those
lands
could
not
be
called
unoccupied
as
they
served
to
supply
the
roman
army
with
forage
for
their
cattle
which
certainly
furnished
the
romans
with
a
just
pretext
for
refusing
to
grant
their
request
and
with
no
less
propriety
the
romans
asked
the
galli
senones
if
it
were
right
to
demand
lands
already
possessed
and
to
threaten
to
take
them
by
force
xviii
since
the
common
right
to
things
has
been
established
the
common
right
to
actions
follows
next
in
order
and
this
right
is
either
absolute
or
established
by
the
supposition
of
a
general
agreement
amongst
mankind
now
all
men
have
absolutely
a
right
to
do
such
or
such
acts
as
are
necessary
to
provide
whatever
is
essential
to
the
existence
or
convenience
of
life
convenience
is
included
in
this
right
for
there
is
no
occasion
here
to
imagine
an
existence
of
the
same
necessity
as
was
requisite
to
authorize
the
seizing
of
property
because
the
point
of
discussion
here
is
not
whether
any
act
is
done
against
the
will
of
an
owner
but
whether
we
acquire
what
is
necessary
for
our
wants
according
to
the
terms
to
which
the
owner
has
agreed
supposing
there
is
nothing
illegal
in
the
contract
nor
any
wilful
intention
on
his
part
to
make
it
null
and
void
for
any
impediment
created
by
the
owner
in
such
transactions
is
repugnant
to
the
very
principles
of
natural
justice
which
suppose
an
equality
of
upright
dealing
to
subsist
in
both
the
parties
concerned
ambrose
calls
a
fraudulent
conduct
of
that
kind
an
attempt
to
deprive
men
of
their
share
in
the
goods
of
a
common
parent
to
withhold
the
productions
of
nature
which
are
the
birthright
of
all
and
to
destroy
that
commerce
which
is
the
very
support
of
life
for
we
are
not
treating
of
superfluities
and
luxuries
but
of
those
things
which
are
essential
to
life
as
physic
food
and
cloathing
xix
from
what
has
already
been
proved
it
follows
that
all
men
have
a
right
to
purchase
the
necessaries
of
life
at
a
reasonable
price
except
the
owners
want
them
for
their
own
use
thus
in
a
great
scarcity
of
corn
there
would
be
no
injustice
in
their
refusing
to
sell
and
yet
in
such
a
time
of
necessity
foreigners
who
have
been
once
admitted
can
not
be
driven
away
but
as
ambrose
shews
in
the
passage
already
quoted
a
common
evil
must
be
borne
by
all
alike
xx
now
owners
have
not
the
same
right
in
the
sale
of
their
goods
for
others
are
at
full
liberty
to
determine
whether
they
will
purchase
certain
articles
or
not
the
ancient
belgians
for
instance
allowed
not
wines
and
other
foreign
merchandise
to
be
imported
among
them
the
same
rule
we
are
informed
by
strabo
was
practised
by
the
nabathaean
arabians
xxi
it
is
supposed
to
be
generally
agreed
among
mankind
that
the
privileges
which
any
nation
grants
promiscuously
to
the
subjects
of
foreign
powers
or
countries
are
the
common
right
of
all
consequently
the
exclusion
of
any
one
people
from
these
rights
would
be
considered
as
an
injury
to
that
people
thus
wherever
foreigners
in
general
are
allowed
to
hunt
to
fish
to
shoot
to
gather
pearls
to
succeed
to
property
by
testament
to
sell
commodities
or
to
form
intermarriages
the
same
privileges
can
not
be
refused
to
any
particular
people
unless
they
have
by
misconduct
forfeited
their
right
on
which
account
the
tribe
of
benjamin
was
debarred
from
intermarrying
with
other
tribes
xxii
it
has
sometimes
been
a
subject
of
inquiry
whether
one
nation
may
lawfully
agree
with
another
to
exclude
all
nations
but
herself
from
purchasing
certain
productions
which
are
the
peculiar
growth
of
her
soil
an
agreement
which
it
is
evident
may
be
lawfully
made
if
the
purchaser
intends
to
supply
other
nations
with
those
articles
at
a
reasonable
price
for
it
is
a
matter
of
indifference
to
other
nations
of
whom
they
purchase
provided
they
can
have
a
reasonable
supply
for
their
wants
nor
is
there
any
thing
unlawful
in
allowing
one
people
an
advantage
over
another
in
this
respect
particularly
for
a
nation
who
has
taken
another
under
her
protection
and
incurred
expence

i
among
the
means
of
acquiring
property
paulus
the
lawyer
reckons
one
which
seems
most
natural
and
that
is
if
by
the
ingenuity
of
art
or
the
exertions
of
labour
we
have
given
to
any
production
its
existence
among
the
works
of
man
now
as
nothing
can
naturally
be
produced
except
from
some
materials
before
in
existence
it
follows
that
if
those
materials
were
our
own
the
possession
of
them
under
any
new
shape
or
commodity
is
only
a
continuation
of
our
former
property
if
they
belonged
to
no
one
our
possession
comes
under
the
class
of
title
by
occupancy
but
if
they
were
another
no
improvement
of
ours
can
by
the
law
of
nature
give
us
a
right
of
property
therein
ii
among
those
things
which
belong
to
no
one
there
are
two
that
may
become
the
subjects
of
occupancy
and
those
are
jurisdiction
or
sovereignty
and
property
for
jurisdiction
and
property
are
distinct
from
each
other
in
their
effects
the
objects
over
which
sovereignty
may
be
exercised
are
of
a
twofold
description
embracing
both
persons
and
things
but
this
is
not
the
case
with
property
the
right
of
which
can
extend
only
to
the
irrational
and
inanimate
part
of
the
creation
though
it
might
originally
for
the
most
part
be
the
same
act
by
which
sovereignty
and
property
were
acquired
yet
they
are
in
their
nature
distinct
sovereignty
says
seneca
belongs
to
princes
and
property
to
individuals
the
sovereignty
therefore
not
only
over
subjects
at
home
but
over
those
in
the
prince
foreign
dominions
passes
with
the
hereditary
descent
of
the
crown
iii
in
places
where
sovereignty
is
already
established
the
right
to
moveables
by
occupancy
and
indeed
every
original
right
must
give
way
to
the
superior
sanction
of
law
and
what
any
man
before
held
by
any
such
right
he
would
afterwards
be
considered
as
holding
by
the
laws
of
the
country
for
those
original
rights
were
permissions
of
the
law
of
nature
and
not
commands
that
were
to
be
perpetually
enforced
for
the
continued
establishment
of
such
a
right
as
that
by
prior
occupancy
so
far
from
promoting
the
welfare
would
operate
to
the
very
destruction
of
human
society
although
it
may
be
said
by
way
of
objection
that
the
law
of
nations
seems
to
admit
of
such
a
right
yet
we
may
answer
that
if
such
a
rule
either
is
or
has
been
commonly
received
in
any
part
of
the
world
it
has
not
the
force
of
a
general
compact
binding
upon
different
independent
nations
but
may
be
considered
as
one
branch
of
the
civil
law
of
many
nations
which
any
state
has
a
right
to
continue
or
repeal
according
to
its
own
pleasure
or
discretion
there
are
many
other
things
indeed
which
legal
writers
in
treating
of
the
division
and
acquisition
of
property
consider
as
forming
a
part
of
the
law
of
nations
iv
rivers
may
be
occupied
by
a
country
not
including
the
stream
above
nor
that
below
its
own
territories
but
the
waters
which
wash
its
lands
form
an
inseparable
part
of
the
current
making
its
way
to
the
main
sea
for
to
constitute
the
right
to
a
property
in
its
channel
it
is
sufficient
that
its
sides
inclosed
by
the
banks
of
that
territory
form
its
greatest
part
and
that
the
river
itself
compared
with
the
land
makes
but
a
small
portion
in
the
same
manner
the
sea
appears
capable
of
being
made
a
property
by
the
power
possessed
of
the
shore
on
both
sides
of
it
although
beyond
those
limits
it
may
spread
to
a
wide
extent
which
is
the
case
with
a
bay
and
with
a
straight
beyond
each
of
its
outlets
into
main
sea
or
ocean
but
this
right
of
property
can
never
take
place
where
the
sea
is
of
such
a
magnitude
as
to
surpass
all
comparison
with
that
portion
of
the
land
which
it
washes
and
the
right
which
one
people
or
prince
possesses
may
also
be
shared
by
a
great
number
of
states
among
whose
respective
territories
the
sea
flows
thus
rivers
separating
two
powers
may
be
occupied
by
both
to
each
of
whom
their
use
and
advantages
may
be
equal
vi
instances
may
be
found
of
treaties
by
which
one
nation
binds
itself
to
another
not
to
navigate
particular
seas
beyond
certain
bounds
thus
between
the
egyptians
and
the
princes
inhabiting
the
borders
of
the
red
sea
it
was
agreed
in
ancient
times
that
the
former
should
not
enter
that
sea
with
any
ship
of
war
nor
with
more
than
one
merchant
ship
in
the
same
manner
in
the
time
of
cimon
the
persians
were
bound
by
a
treaty
made
with
the
athenians
not
to
sail
with
any
ship
of
war
between
the
cyanean
rocks
and
the
chelidonian
islands
a
prohibition
which
after
the
battle
of
salamis
restricted
any
persian
armed
vessel
from
sailing
between
phaselis
and
the
above
named
rocks
in
the
one
year
truce
of
the
peloponnesian
war
the
lacedaemonians
were
prohibited
from
sailing
with
any
ships
of
war
whatever
or
indeed
with
any
other
ships
of
more
than
twenty
tons
burden
and
in
the
first
treaty
which
the
romans
immediately
after
the
expulsion
of
their
kings
made
with
the
carthaginians
it
was
stipulated
that
neither
the
romans
nor
their
allies
should
sail
beyond
the
promontory
of
pulchrum
except
they
were
driven
thither
by
stress
of
weather
or
to
avoid
being
captured
by
an
enemy
but
in
either
case
they
were
to
take
nothing
more
than
necessaries
and
to
depart
before
the
expiration
of
five
days
and
in
the
second
treaty
the
romans
were
prohibited
from
committing
any
acts
of
piracy
or
even
from
trading
beyond
the
promontory
of
pulchrum
massia
and
tarseius
in
a
treaty
of
peace
between
the
illyrians
and
romans
the
latter
required
that
they
should
not
pass
beyond
the
lissus
with
more
than
two
frigates
and
those
unarmed
in
the
peace
with
antiochus
he
was
bound
not
to
sail
within
the
capes
of
calycadnius
and
sarpedon
except
with
ships
carrying
tribute
ambassadors
or
hostages
now
the
instances
alluded
to
do
not
prove
the
actual
occupancy
of
the
sea
or
the
right
of
navigation
for
it
may
happen
that
both
individuals
and
nations
may
grant
as
a
matter
of
favour
or
compact
not
only
what
they
have
a
competent
right
to
dispose
of
but
that
which
is
the
common
right
of
all
men
as
well
as
of
themselves
when
this
happens
we
may
say
as
ulpian
did
on
a
like
occasion
where
an
estate
had
been
sold
with
a
reservation
that
the
purchaser
should
not
fish
for
tunny
to
the
prejudice
of
the
seller
he
observed
that
the
sea
could
not
be
rendered
subject
to
a
service
but
still
the
purchaser
and
those
who
succeeded
to
his
possession
were
bound
in
honour
to
observe
that
part
of
the
contract
vii
whenever
a
river
has
changed
its
course
disputes
have
arisen
between
neighboring
states
to
decide
whether
such
an
alteration
creates
any
change
in
the
adjoining
territories
and
to
whom
any
addition
of
land
occasioned
by
that
change
accrues
disputes
which
must
be
settled
according
to
the
nature
and
manner
of
such
acquisition
writers
who
have
treated
of
the
division
of
land
have
described
it
as
of
a
threefold
nature
one
kind
they
name
divided
and
assigned
land
which
frontinus
the
lawyer
calls
limited
because
it
is
marked
out
by
artificial
boundaries
by
land
assigned
is
meant
that
which
has
been
appropriated
to
a
whole
community
comprehending
a
certain
number
of
families
a
hundred
for
instance
from
whence
it
has
derived
that
name
and
those
portions
are
called
hundreds
there
is
another
division
called
arcifinium
which
is
applied
when
the
land
is
defended
against
an
enemy
by
the
natural
boundaries
of
rivers
or
mountains
these
lands
aggenus
urbicus
calls
occupatory
being
such
as
have
been
occupied
either
by
reason
of
their
being
vacant
or
by
the
power
of
conquest
in
the
two
first
kinds
of
lands
because
their
extent
and
bounds
are
fixed
and
determined
though
a
river
should
change
its
course
it
occasions
no
change
of
territory
and
what
is
added
by
alluvion
will
belong
to
the
former
occupant
in
arcifinious
lands
where
the
bounds
are
formed
by
nature
any
gradual
change
in
the
course
of
the
river
makes
a
change
also
in
the
boundaries
of
territory
and
whatever
accession
is
given
by
the
river
to
one
side
it
will
belong
to
the
possessor
of
the
land
on
that
side
because
the
respective
nations
are
supposed
originally
to
have
taken
possession
of
those
lands
with
an
intention
of
making
the
middle
of
that
river
as
a
natural
boundary
the
line
of
separation
between
them
thus
tacitus
in
speaking
of
the
usipians
and
tencterians
who
border
on
the
cattians
says
their
territory
lies
on
the
banks
of
the
rhine
where
that
river
still
flowing
in
one
regular
channel
forms
a
sufficient
boundary
viii
decisions
like
those
above
can
only
take
place
in
instances
where
the
river
has
not
altered
its
channel
for
a
river
dividing
territories
is
not
to
be
considered
barely
as
so
much
water
but
as
water
flowing
in
a
particular
channel
and
inclosed
within
certain
banks
for
which
reason
an
addition
a
decrease
or
such
a
change
of
small
portions
as
leaves
the
ancient
appearance
upon
the
whole
nearly
the
same
allows
us
to
consider
the
river
as
still
the
same
but
if
the
whole
face
of
the
river
is
changed
the
case
will
be
entirely
altered
for
as
a
river
may
be
entirely
destroyed
by
the
erection
of
dams
upon
the
higher
parts
of
its
stream
or
by
digging
canals
which
carry
off
its
waters
in
another
direction
so
by
the
desertion
of
its
old
channel
and
breaking
out
for
itself
another
course
it
will
not
continue
to
be
same
river
it
was
before
but
will
be
completely
a
new
one
in
the
same
manner
if
a
river
has
been
dried
up
the
middle
of
its
channel
will
remain
as
the
boundary
between
neighbouring
states
who
in
taking
possession
of
the
neighbouring
territory
originally
intended
the
middle
of
such
a
river
to
be
the
line
of
separation
and
under
all
changes
to
preserve
the
same
as
a
permanent
limit
but
in
doubtful
cases
the
territories
bordering
upon
a
river
ought
to
be
considered
as
arcifinious
because
nothing
can
be
a
more
apt
mark
of
distinction
than
those
impassable
bounds
assigned
by
nature
it
very
seldom
indeed
happens
that
the
artificial
or
civil
admeasurements
of
territory
can
be
regulated
by
such
natural
bounds
as
they
are
in
general
the
effect
of
original
acquisition
or
have
been
ceded
by
treaty
ix
although
in
doubtful
cases
it
has
been
said
that
the
territories
on
each
side
of
a
river
are
determined
by
the
middle
of
the
channel
yet
it
may
happen
and
has
happened
that
the
sole
right
to
a
river
may
belong
to
the
territories
on
one
side
of
it
because
that
on
the
opposite
side
was
of
later
occupancy
and
subsequent
to
the
possession
of
that
river
by
the
other
power
or
because
this
sole
right
may
have
been
so
settled
by
treaty
x
it
is
not
unworthy
of
observation
that
things
which
have
had
an
owner
but
have
ceased
to
have
one
become
subject
to
the
right
by
original
acquisition
they
are
supposed
to
have
been
abandoned
from
the
want
of
an
owner
and
therefore
have
returned
to
the
original
state
of
common
stock
but
at
the
same
time
it
is
proper
to
observe
that
some
times
the
original
acquisition
may
have
been
made
by
a
people
or
their
sovereign
in
such
a
manner
as
to
give
them
or
him
not
only
those
rights
which
constitute
prerogative
but
also
the
full
title
of
property
and
this
property
again
may
be
divided
into
smaller
grants
and
those
again
subdivided
into
other
portions
to
be
held
as
dependent
upon
the
original
grantor
the
sovereign
or
the
lord
though
the
land
may
not
be
held
by
base
service
or
vassalage
yet
it
is
possessed
by
some
conditional
tenure
for
things
are
occupied
by
many
kinds
of
right
among
which
may
be
reckoned
the
right
of
a
person
who
expects
property
to
be
left
to
him
under
the
condition
of
a
trust
seneca
says
that
an
owner
being
debarred
from
selling
his
lands
committing
waste
upon
them
or
even
making
improvements
is
not
to
be
taken
as
a
proof
that
the
property
is
not
his
for
that
is
a
man
own
which
he
holds
under
any
certain
conditions
since
then
property
distributed
in
the
manner
above
named
is
held
of
the
sovereign
or
of
some
intermediate
lord
who
himself
is
tenant
of
the
sovereign
it
follows
that
any
thing
which
wants
an
owner
does
not
become
the
property
of
him
who
can
first
seize
it
but
reverts
to
the
state

to
the

a

difficulty
arises
here
respecting
the
right
to

by
uninterrupted
possession
for
any
certain
time
for
though
time
is
the
great
agent
by
whose
motion
all
legal
concerns
and
rights
may
be
measured
and
determined
yet
it
has
no
effectual
power
of
itself
to
create
an
express
title
to
any
property
now
those
rights
were
introduced
by
the
civil
law
and
it
is
not
their
long
continuance
but
the
express
provisions
of
the
municipal
law
which
gives
them
their
validity
they
are
of
no
force
therefore
in
the
opinion
of
vasquez
between
two
independent
nations
or
sovereigns
or
between
a
free
nation
and
a
sovereign
between
a
sovereign
and
an
individual
who
is
not
his
subject
or
between
two
subjects
belonging
to
different
kings
or
nations
which
indeed
seems
true
and
is
actually
the
case
for
such
points
relating
to
persons
and
things
are
not
left
to
the
law
of
nature
but
are
settled
by
the
respective
laws
of
each
country
as
the
unqualified
admission
of
this
principle
would
lead
to
great
inconvenience
and
prevent
the
disputes
of
kings
and
nations
respecting
the
bounds
of
territory
from
ever
being
adjusted
in
order
to
eradicate
the
seeds
of
perpetual
warfare
and
confusion
so
repugnant
to
the
interests
and
feelings
of
every
people
the
settlement
of
such
boundaries
is
not
left
to
the
claims
of
prescriptive
right
but
the
territories
of
each
contending
party
are
in
general
expressly
defined
by
certain
treaties
ii
to

repugnant
to
the
general
interests
and
feelings
of
mankind
for
we
find
in
holy
writ
that
when
the
king
of
the
ammonites
demanded
the
lands
situated
between
the
rivers
arnon
and
jabok
and
those
extending
from
the
deserts
of
arabia
to
the
jordan
jepthah
opposed
his
pretentious
by
proving
his
own
possession
of
the
same
for
three
hundred
years
and
asked
why
he
and
his
ancestors
had
for
so
long
a
period
neglected
to
make
their
claim
and
the
lacedaemonians
we
are
informed
by
isocrates
laid
it
down
for
a
certain
rule
admitted
among
all
nations
that
the
right
to
public
territory
as
well
as
to
private
property
was
so
firmly
established
by
length
of
time
that
it
could
not
be
disturbed
and
upon
this
ground
they
rejected
the
claim
of
those
who
demanded
the
restoration
of
messena
resting
upon
a
right
like
this
philip
the
second
was
induced
to
declare
to
titus
quintius
that
he
would
restore
the
dominions
which
he
had
subdued
himself
but
would
upon
no
consideration
give
up
the
possessions
which
he
had
derived
from
his
ancestors
by
a
just
and
hereditary
title
sulpitius
speaking
against
antiochus
proved
how
unjust
it
was
in
him
to
pretend
that
because
the
greek
nations
in
asia
had
once
been
under
the
subjection
of
his
forefathers
he
had
a
right
to
revive
those
claims
and
to
reduce
them
again
to
a
state
of
servitude
and
upon
this
subject
two
historians
tacitus
and
diodorus
may
be
referred
to
the
former
of
whom
calls
such
obsolete
pretensions
empty
talking
and
the
latter
treats
them
as
idle
tales
and
fables
with
these
opinions
cicero
in
his
book
of
offices
agrees
asking
what
justice
there
can
be
in
depriving
an
owner
of
the
land
which
he
has
for
many
ages
quietly
possessed
iii
can
it
be
said
in
order
to
justify
the
disturbance
of
long
enjoyed
possessions
that
the
rightful
owner
intended
to
assert
his
claim
when
he
never
manifested
such
intention
by
any
outward
visible
act
the
effect
of
right
which
depends
upon
a
man
intentions
can
never
follow
from
a
bare
conjecture
of
his
will
unless
he
has
declared
and
proved
it
by
some
express
and
visible
act
for
actions
being
the
only
evidence
of
intentions
intentions
can
never
of
themselves
alone
without
such
acts
be
the
object
of
human
laws
no
conjectures
indeed
respecting
the
acts
of
the
mind
can
be
reduced
to
mathematical
certainty
but
only
to
the
evidence
of
probability
at
the
utmost
for
men
by
their
words
may
express
intentions
different
from
their
real
ones
and
by
their
acts
counterfeit
intentions
which
they
have
not
the
nature
of
human
society
however
requires
that
all
acts
of
the
mind
when
sufficiently
indicated
should
be
followed
by
their
due
effects
therefore
the
intention
which
has
been
sufficiently
indicated
is
taken
for
granted
against
him
who
gave
such
indication
iv
but
to
proceed
to
proofs
derived
from
actions
a
thing
is
understood
to
be
abandoned
when
it
is
cast
away
except
it
be
under
particular
circumstances
as
throwing
goods
overboard
in
a
storm
to
lighten
a
ship
where
the
owner
is
not
supposed
to
have
abandoned
all
intention
of
recovery
should
it
ever
be
in
his
power
again
by
giving
up
or
cancelling
a
promissory
note
a
debt
is
deemed
to
be
discharged
paulus
the
lawyer
says
a
right
to
property
may
be
renounced
not
only
by
words
but
also
by
actions
or
any
other
indication
of
the
will
thus
if
an
owner
knowingly
make
a
contract
with
any
one
who
is
in
possession
treating
him
as
if
he
were
the
rightful
proprietor
he
is
naturally
supposed
to
have
relinquished
his
own
pretensions
nor
is
there
any
reason
why
the
same
rule
may
not
take
place
between
sovereign
princes
and
independent
states
as
between
individuals
in
the
same
manner
a
lord
by
granting
certain
privileges
to
his
vassal
which
he
could
not
legally
enjoy
without
a
release
from
his
former
obligations
was
supposed
by
such
act
to
have
given
him
his
freedom
a
power
derived
not
from
the
civil
law
only
but
from
the
law
of
nature
which
allows
every
man
to
relinquish
what
is
his
own
and
from
a
natural
presumption
that
a
person
designed
to
do
the
act
which
he
has
given
manifest
proofs
of
his
intention
to
do
in
this
sense
ulpian
may
be
rightly
understood
where
he
says
that
acceptilation
or
the
verbal
discharge
of
a
debt
is
founded
upon
the
law
of
nations
even
omissions
taking
all
proper
circumstances
into
consideration
come
under
the
cognizance
of
the
law
thus
the
person
who
knowing
of
an
act
and
being
present
at
the
commission
of
it
passes
it
over
in
silence
seems
to
give
his
consent
to
it
this
was
admitted
by
the
mosaic
law
unless
indeed
it
can
be
shewn
that
the
same
person
was
hindered
from
speaking
either
by
fear
or
some
other
pressing
circumstance
thus
a
thing
is
accounted
as
lost
when
all
hope
of
recovering
it
is
given
up
as
for
instance
if
a
tame
animal
which
was
in
our
possession
be
seized
and
carried
off
by
a
wild
beast
goods
too
lost
by
shipwreck
ulpian
says
cease
to
be
considered
as
our
own
not
immediately
but
when
they
are
lost
beyond
all
possibility
of
being
reclaimed
and
when
no
proofs
of
the
owner
intention
to
reclaim
them
can
be
discovered
now
the
case
is
altered
if
persons
were
sent
to
inquire
after
the
lost
goods
or
property
and
a
reward
was
promised
to
the
finder
but
if
a
person
knows
his
property
to
be
in
the
possession
of
another
and
allows
it
to
remain
so
for
a
length
of
time
without
asserting
his
claim
unless
there
appear
sufficient
reasons
for
his
silence
he
is
construed
to
have
entirely
abandoned
all
pretensions
to
the
same
and
to
the
same
purpose
he
has
said
elsewhere
that
a
house
is
looked
upon
to
be
abandoned
on
account
of
the
long
silence
of
the
proprietor
the
emperor
antoninus
pius
in
one
of
his
rescripts
said
there
was
but
little
justice
in
claiming
interest
upon
money
after
a
long
period
for
the
length
of
time
elapsed
was
an
indication
that
the
debtor
had
been
excused
from
payment
from
some
motive
of
kindness
there
appears
something
similar
to
this
in
the
nature
of
custom
for
apart
from
the
authority
of
civil
laws
which
regulate
the
time
and
manner
of
custom
and
its
introduction
it
may
arise
from
the
indulgence
of
a
sovereign
to
a
conquered
people
but
the
length
of
time
from
which
custom
derives
the
force
of
right
is
not
defined
but
left
to
the
arbitrary
decision
of
what
is
sufficient
to
indicate
general
consent
but
for
silence
to
be
taken
as
a
valid
presumption
that
property
is
deserted
two
things
are
requisite
it
must
be
a
silence
with
a
knowledge
of
the
fact
and
with
a
perfect
freedom
of
will
in
the
person
concerned
for
a
silence
founded
in
ignorance
can
have
no
weight
and
where
any
other
reason
appears
the
presumption
of
free
consent
must
fail
vi
although
the
two
requisites
already
named
may
be
produced
yet
other
reasons
have
their
weight
among
which
length
of
time
is
not
the
least
important
for
in
the
first
place
it
can
scarcely
happen
that
for
a
great
length
of
time
a
thing
belonging
to
any
one
should
not
some
way
or
other
come
to
his
knowledge
as
time
might
supply
many
opportunities
even
if
the
civil
law
did
not
interpose
to
bar
remote
pretensions
the
very
nature
of
things
would
shew
the
reasonableness
of
a
shorter
period
of
limitation
being
allowed
to
present
than
to
absent
claimants
if
impressions
of
fear
were
pleaded
by
any
one
in
excuse
yet
their
influence
would
not
be
of
perpetual
duration
and
length
of
time
would
unfold
various
means
of
security
against
such
fears
either
from
resources
within
himself
or
from
the
assistance
of
others
escaping
beyond
the
reach
of
him
he
dreaded
he
might
protest
against
his
oppression
by
appealing
to
proper
judges
and
arbitrators
vii
now
as
time
immemorial
considered
in
a
moral
light
seems
to
have
no
bounds
silence
for
such
a
length
of
time
appears
sufficient
to
establish
the
presumption
that
all
claim
to
a
thing
is
abandoned
unless
the
strongest
proofs
to
the
contrary
can
be
produced
the
most
able
lawyers
have
properly
observed
that
time
according
to
the
memory
of
man
is
not
an
hundred
years
though
probably
it
may
not
fall
far
short
of
that
space
for
a
hundred
years
are
the
term
beyond
which
human
existence
seldom
reaches
a
space
which
in
general
completes
three
ages
or
generations
of
men
the
romans
made
this
objection
to
antiochus
that
he
claimed
cities
which
neither
he
himself
his
father
nor
his
grandfather
had
ever
possessed
viii
from
the
natural
affection
which
all
men
have
for
themselves
and
their
property
an
objection
may
be
taken
against
the
presumption
of
any
one
abandoning
a
thing
which
belongs
to
him
and
consequently
negative
acts
even
though
confirmed
by
a
long
period
of
time
are
not
sufficient
to
establish
the
above
named
conjecture
now
considering
the
great
importance
deservedly
attached
to
the
settlement
of
crowns
all
conjectures
favourable
to
the
possessors
ought
to
be
allowed
for
if
aratus
of
sicyon
thought
it
a
hard
case
that
private
possessions
of
fifty
years
standing
should
be
disturbed
how
much
weightier
is
that
maxim
of
augustus
that
it
is
the
character
of
a
good
man
and
a
good
subject
to
wish
for
no
change
in
the
present
government
and
in
the
words
which
thucydides
has
assigned
to
alcibiades
to
support
the
constitution
under
which
he
has
been
born
but
if
no
such
rules
in
favour
of
possession
could
be
adduced
yet
a
more
weighty
objection
might
be
found
against
the
presumption
drawn
from
the
inclination
of
every
one
to
preserve
his
own
right
which
is
the
improbability
of
one
man
allowing
another
to
usurp
his
property
for
any
length
of
time
without
declaring
and
asserting
his
own
right
ix
perhaps
it
may
reasonably
be
said
that
this
matter
does
not
rest
upon
presumption
only
but
that
it
is
a
rule
introduced
by
the
voluntary
law
of
nations
that
uninterrupted
possession
against
which
no
claim
has
been
asserted
will
entirely
transfer
such
property
to
the
actual
possessor
for
it
is
most
likely
that
all
nations
by
consent
gave
their
sanction
to
such
a
practice
as
conducive
to
their
common
peace
the
term
uninterrupted
possession
therefore
has
been
very
properly
used
to
signify
as
sulpitius
says
in
livy
that
which
has
been
held
by
one
uniform
tenour
of
right
without
intermission
or
as
the
same
author
in
another
place
calls
it
perpetual
possession
that
has
never
been
called
in
question
for
a
transitory
possession
creates
no
title
and
it
was
this
exception
which
the
numidians
had
urged
against
the
carthaginians
alleging
that
as
opportunity
offered
sometimes
the
kings
of
the
numidians
had
appropriated
to
themselves
the
disputed
possessions
which
had
always
remained
in
the
hands
of
the
stronger
party
x
but
here
another
question
and
that
of
considerable
difficulty
arises
which
is
to
decide
whether
by
this
desertion
persons
yet
unborn
may
be
deprived
of
their
rights
if
we
maintain
that
they
may
not
the
rule
already
established
would
be
of
no
avail
towards
settling
the
tranquillity
of
kingdoms
and
security
of
property
for
in
most
things
some
thing
is
due
to
the
interests
of
posterity
but
if
we
affirm
that
they
may
it
then
seems
wonderful
that
silence
should
prejudice
the
rights
of
those
who
were
unable
to
speak
before
they
had
any
existence
and
that
the
act
of
others
should
operate
to
their
injury
to
clear
up
this
point
we
must
observe
that
no
rights
can
belong
to
a
person
before
he
has
any
existence
as
in
the
language
of
the
schools
there
can
be
no
accident
without
a
substance
wherefore
if
a
prince
from
urgent
motives
of
policy
and
for
the
advantage
of
his
own
native
dominions
and
subjects
should
decline
to
accept
an
additional
sovereignty
or
for
the
same
reasons
should
relinquish
that
which
he
had
already
accepted
he
would
not
be
charged
with
injuring
his
heirs
and
successors
then
unborn
who
could
have
no
rights
before
they
had
a
natural
existence
now
as
a
sovereign
may
expressly
declare
a
change
of
his
will
respecting
such
dominions
so
that
change
may
in
certain
cases
be
implied
without
such
declaration
in
consequence
of
such
a
change
either
expressed
or
implied
before
the
rights
of
heirs
and
successors
can
be
supposed
to
have
any
existence
the
possession
may
be
considered
as
entirely
abandoned
the
case
here
has
been
considered
according
to
the
law
of
nature
for
the
civil
law
among
other
fictions
introduced
that
of
the
law
personating
those
who
are
not
yet
in
being
and
so
preventing
any
occupancy
from
taking
place
to
their
prejudice
a
regulation
of
law
established
upon
no
slight
grounds
in
order
to
preserve
estates
in
families
although
every
means
of
perpetuating
property
to
individuals
which
prevents
its
transfer
from
hand
to
hand
may
in
some
measure
be
detrimental
to
the
public
interest
from
whence
it
is
a
received
opinion
that
length
of
time
will
give
a
property
in
those
fees
which
were
originally
conveyed
not
by
right
of
succession
but
by
virtue
of
primitive
investiture
covarruvias
a
lawyer
of
great
judgment
supports
this
opinion
with
the
strongest
arguments
in
favour
of
primogeniture
and
applies
it
to
estates
left
in
trust
for
nothing
can
prevent
the
civil
law
from
instituting
a
right
which
though
it
can
not
be
lawfully
alienated
by
the
act
of
one
party
without
consent
of
the
other
yet
to
avoid
uncertainty
in
the
tenure
of
present
proprietors
may
be
lost
by
neglect
of
claim
for
a
length
of
time
still
the
parties
thus
deprived
may
maintain
a
personal
action
against
those
or
their
heirs
through
whose
neglect
their
right
has
been
forfeited
xi
it
is
an
inquiry
of
importance
whether
the
law
of
usucaption
and
prescription
if
it
prevail
in
a
prince
dominions
can
be
applied
to
the
tenure
of
the
crown
and
all
its
prerogatives
many
legal
writers
who
have
treated
of
the
nature
of
sovereign
power
according
to
the
principles
of
the
roman
civil
law
seem
to
affirm
that
it
may
be
so
applied
but
this
is
an
opinion
to
which
we
can
not
accede
in
its
full
extent
for
to
make
a
law
binding
upon
any
one
it
is
requisite
that
the
legislator
should
possess
both
power
and
will
a
legislator
is
not
bound
by
his
law
as
by
the
irrevocable
and
unchangeable
controul
of
a
superior
but
occasions
may
arise
that
will
demand
an
alteration
or
even
a
repeal
of
the
law
which
he
has
made
yet
a
legislator
may
be
bound
by
his
own
law
not
directly
as
a
legislator
but
as
an
individual
forming
part
of
the
community
and
that
too
according
to
natural
equity
which
requires
that
all
the
component
parts
should
bear
a
reference
to
the
whole
we
find
in
holy
writ
this
rule
observed
by
saul
in
the
beginning
of
his
reign
now
that
rule
does
not
take
place
here
for
we
are
considering
the
lawgiver
not
as
a
part
but
as
the
representative
and
sovereign
of
the
whole
community
nor
indeed
can
any
such
intention
in
the
lawgiver
be
presumed
to
have
existed
for
legislators
are
not
supposed
to
comprehend
themselves
within
the
rule
of
the
law
except
where
the
nature
and
subject
of
it
are
general
but
sovereignty
is
not
to
be
compared
with
other
things
it
so
far
surpasses
them
in
the
nobleness
of
its
end
and
the
dignity
of
its
nature
nor
is
any
civil
law
to
be
found

union
and
ii
after
the
preceding
inquiries
into
the
manner
in
which
private
property
as
well
as
sovereign
power
may
be
acquired
and
transferred
the
manner
in
which
they
cease
naturally
comes
next
under
consideration
it
has
been
shewn
before
that
the
right
to
property
may
be
lost
by
neglect
for
property
can
continue
no
longer
than
while
the
will
of
ownership
continues
there
is
also
another
manner
in
which
property
may
cease
to
exist
without
any
express
or
implied
alienation
and
that
is
where
the
family
either
of
a
sovereign
or
an
owner
becomes
extinct
a
contingency
for
which
provision
must
be
made
somewhat
similar
to
a
succession
to
the
property
of
one
who
dies
intestate
wherefore
if
any
one
die
without
any
declaration
of
his
will
and
have
no
relations
by
blood
all
the
right
which
he
had
becomes
extinct
and
reverts
if
a
sovereign
to
the
hands
of
the
nation
except
where
express
provisions
of
law
have
been
made
to
the
contrary
iii
the
same
mode
of
reasoning
applies
to
a
nation
isocrates
and
after
him
the
emperor
julian
has
said
that
states
are
immortal
or
may
be
so
for
a
people
is
one
of
that
kind
of
bodies
which
are
formed
of
distinct
parts
following
each
other
in
regular
succession
and
supplying
the
place
of
the
deceased
this
body
goes
under
one
name
forming
as
plutarch
says
one
constitution
or
in
the
language
of
paulus
the
lawyer
one
spirit
now
the
spirit
or
constitution
in
a
people
is
the
full
and
perfect
harmony
of
civil
life
from
which
emanates
the
sovereign
power
the
very
soul
of
all
government
and
as
seneca
says
the
vital
breath
which
so
many
thousands
draw
these
artificial
bodies
bear
a
close
resemblance
to
the
natural
body
which
notwithstanding
the
alteration
of
its
component
particles
loses
not
its
identity
so
long
as
the
general
form
remains
and
therefore
in
the
passage
of
seneca
where
he
says
that
no
one
is
the
same
in
his
old
age
that
he
was
in
his
youth
he
means
only
as
to
natural
substance
in
the
same
manner
heraclitus
as
cited
by
plato
in
cratylus
and
seneca
in
the
place
already
quoted
has
said
that
we
can
not
descend
twice
into
the
same
river
but
seneca
afterwards
corrects
himself
adding
that
the
river
retains
its
name
though
the
watery
particles
of
which
it
is
composed
are
perpetually
changing
so
aristotle
too
in
comparing
nations
to
rivers
has
said
that
the
rivers
are
always
called
by
the
same
name
though
their
several
parts
are
fluctuating
every
moment
nor
is
it
the
name
alone
which
continues
but
that
principle
also
which
conon
calls
the
constitutional
system
of
the
body
and
philo
the
spirit
that
holds
it
together
so
that
a
people
as
alphenus
and
plutarch
in
speaking
of
the
late
but
unerring
approach
of
divine
vengeance
maintain
though
not
one
of
its
members
of
a
former
period
be
now
living
is
the
same
at
present
that
it
was
a
hundred
years
ago
as
long
as
the
spirit
which
first
framed
and
afterwards
kept
the
body
together
preserves
its
identity
hence
has
originated
the
custom
in
addressing
a
people
of
ascribing
to
them
who
are
now
living
what
happened
to
the
same
people
many
ages
before
as
may
be
seen
both
in
profane
historians
and
in
the
books
of
holy
writ
so
in
tacitus
antony
the
first
serving
under
vespasian
reminds
the
soldiers
of
the
third
legion
of
what
they
had
done
in
former
times
how
under
mark
antony
they
had
beaten
the
parthians
and
under
corbulo
the
armenians
there
was
more
of
prejudice
therefore
than
truth
in
the
reproach
which
piso
cast
upon
the
athenians
of
his
own
time
refusing
to
consider
them
as
athenians
since
they
had
become
extinct
by
so
many
disasters
and
were
nothing
more
than
a
base
mixture
of
all
nations
of
the
earth
we
say
there
was
more
of
prejudice
than
truth
in
this
reproach
for
though
such
a
mixture
might
diminish
the
dignity
it
could
not
destroy
the
existence
of
a
people
nor
was
he
himself
ignorant
of
this
for
he
reproaches
the
athenians
of
his
own
day
with
their
feeble
efforts
in
former
times
against
philip
of
macedon
and
their
ingratitude
to
their
best
friends
now
as
a
change
of
its
component
parts
can
not
destroy
the
identity
of
a
people
not
even
for
a
thousand
years
or
more
so
neither
can
it
be
denied
that
a
people
may
lose
its
existence
in
two
ways
either
by
the
extinction
of
all
its
members
or
by
the
extinction
of
its
form
and
spirit
iv
a
body
is
said
to
die
when
its
essential
parts
and
necessary
form
of
subsistence
are
destroyed
to
the
former
case
may
be
referred
the
instance
of
nations
swallowed
up
by
the
sea
as
plato
relates
and
others
whom
tertullian
mentions
or
if
a
people
should
be
destroyed
by
an
earthquake
of
which
there
are
many
instances
in
history
or
should
destroy
themselves
as
the
sidonians
and
saguntines
did
we
are
informed
by
pliny
that
in
ancient
latium
nations
were
destroyed
without
a
single
trace
of
them
remaining
but
what
it
may
be
said
will
be
the
case
if
out
of
such
a
nation
so
few
remain
that
they
can
not
form
a
people
they
will
then
retain
that
property
which
they
had
before
as
private
persons
but
not
in
a
public
capacity
the
same
is
the
case
with
every
community
a
people
loses
its
form
by
losing
all
or
some
of
those
rights
which
it
had
in
common
and
this
happens
either
when
every
individual
is
reduced
to
slavery
as
the
mycenaeans
who
were
sold
by
the
argives
the
olynthians
by
philip
the
thebans
by
alexander
and
the
brutians
made
public
slaves
by
the
romans
or
when
though
they
retain
their
personal
liberty
they
are
deprived
of
the
rights
of
sovereignty
thus
livy
informs
us
respecting
capua
that
the
romans
determined
though
it
might
be
inhabited
as
a
city
that
there
should
be
no
municipal
body
no
senate
no
public
council
no
magistrates
but
that
deprived
of
political
deliberation
and
sovereign
authority
the
inhabitants
should
be
considered
as
a
multitude
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
a
praefect
sent
from
rome
therefore
cicero
in
his
first
speech
against
rullus
says
that
there
was
no
image
of
a
republic
left
at
capua
the
same
may
be
said
of
nations
reduced
to
the
form
of
provinces
and
of
those
subjugated
by
another
power
as
byzantium
was
to
perinthus
by
the
emperor
severus
and
antioch
to
laodicea
by
theodosius
vi
but
if
a
nation
should
emigrate
either
spontaneously
on
account
of
scarcity
or
any
other
calamity
or
if
by
compulsion
which
was
the
case
with
the
people
of
carthage
in
the
third
punic
war
while
she
retains
her
form
she
does
not
cease
to
be
a
people
and
still
less
so
if
only
the
walls
of
her
cities
be
destroyed
and
therefore
when
the
lacedaemonians
refused
to
admit
the
messenians
to
swear
to
the
peace
of
greece
because
the
walls
of
their
city
were
destroyed
it
was
carried
against
them
in
the
general
assembly
of
the
allies
nor
does
it
make
any
difference
in
the
argument
whatever
the
form
of
government
may
be
whether
regal
aristocratical
or
democratical
the
roman
people
for
instance
was
the
same
whether
under
kings
consuls
or
emperors
even
indeed
under
the
most
absolute
form
the
people
is
the
same
that
it
was
in
its
independent
state
while
the
king
governs
it
as
head
of
that
people
and
not
of
any
other
for
the
sovereignty
which
resides
in
the
king
as
the
head
resides
in
the
people
likewise
as
the
body
of
which
he
is
the
head
and
therefore
in
an
elective
government
if
the
king
or
the
royal
family
should
become
extinct
the
rights
of
sovereignty
as
it
has
been
already
shewn
would
revert
to
the
people
nor
is
this
argument
overthrown
by
the
objection
drawn
from
aristotle
who
says
that
if
the
form
of
government
is
changed
the
state
no
longer
continues
to
be
the
same
as
the
harmony
of
a
piece
of
music
is
entirely
changed
by
a
transition
from
the
doric
to
the
phrygian
measure
now
it
is
to
be
observed
that
an
artificial
system
may
possess
many
different
forms
as
in
an
army
under
one
supreme
commander
there
are
many
subordinate
parts
and
inferior
powers
while
in
the
operations
of
the
field
it
appears
but
as
one
body
in
same
manner
the
union
of
the
legislative
and
executive
in
a
state
gives
it
the
appearance
of
one
form
while
the
distinction
between
subject
and
sovereign
and
their
still
mutual
relation
give
it
another
the
executive
power
is
the
politician
concern
the
judicial
the
lawyer
nor
did
this
escape
the
notice
of
aristotle
for
he
says
it
belongs
to
a
science
different
from
that
of
politics
to
determine
whether
under
a
change
in
the
form
of
government
the
debts
contracted
under
the
old
system
ought
to
be
discharged
by
the
members
of
the
new
he
does
this
to
avoid
the
fault
which
he
blames
in
many
other
writers
of
making
digressions
from
one
subject
to
another
it
is
evident
that
a
state
which
from
a
commonwealth
has
become
a
regal
government
is
answerable
for
the
debts
incurred
before
that
change
for
it
is
the
same
people
possessing
all
the
same
rights
and
powers
which
are
now
exercised
in
a
different
manner
being
no
longer
vested
in
the
body
but
in
the
head
this
furnishes
a
ready
answer
to
a
question
some
times
asked
which
is
what
place
in
general
assemblies
of
different
states
ought
to
be
assigned
to
a
sovereign
to
whom
the
people
of
a
commonwealth
have
transferred
all
their
power
undoubtedly
the
same
place
which
that
people
or
their
representatives
had
occupied
before
in
such
councils
thus
in
the
amphictyonic
council
philip
of
macedon
succeeded
to
the
place
of
the
phocensians
so
on
the
other
hand
the
people
of
a
commonwealth
occupy
the
place
assigned
to
sovereigns
viii
whenever
two
nations
become
united
their
rights
as
distinct
states
will
not
be
lost
but
will
be
communicated
to
each
other
thus
the
rights
of
the
albans
in
the
first
place
and
afterwards
those
of
the
sabines
as
we
are
informed
by
livy
were
transferred
to
the
romans
and
they
became
one
government
the
same
reasoning
holds
good
respecting
states
which
are
joined
not
by
a
federal
union
but
by
having
one
sovereign
for
their
head
ix
on
the
other
hand
it
may
happen
that
a
nation
originally
forming
but
one
state
may
be
divided
either
by
mutual
consent
or
by
the
fate
of
war
as
the
body
of
the
persian
empire
was
divided
among
the
successors
of
alexander
when
this
is
the
case
many
sovereign
powers
arise
in
the
place
of
one
each
enjoying
its
independent
rights
whatever
belonged
to
the
original
state
in
common
must
either
continue
to
be
governed
as
a
common
concern
or
be
divided
in
equitable
proportions
to
this
head
may
be
referred
the
voluntary
separation
which
takes
place
when
a
nation
sends
out
colonies
for
thus
a
new
people
as
it
were
is
formed
enjoying
their
own
rights
and
as
thucydides
says
sent
out
not
upon
terms
of
slavery
but
equality
yet
still
owing
respect
and
obedience
to
their
the
same
writer
speaking
of
the
second
colony
sent
by
the
corinthians
to
epidamnus
says
they
gave
public
notice
that
such
as
were
willing
to
go
should
enjoy
equal
privileges
with
those

the
obligation
arising
from
property
origin
and
nature
of
the
obligation
to
restore
what
belongs
to
another
obligation
to
restore
to
the
rightful
owner
the
profits
that
have
accrued
from
the
unjust
possession
of
his
personal
or
real
property
a
possessor
not
bound
to
restitution
if
the
thing
has
perished
such
possessor
bound
to
the
restitution
of
the
profits
remaining
in
his
hands
bound
to
make
reparation
for
the
consumption
occasioned
by
his

bound
to
make
a
recompence
for

the

that
the
property
of
things
valued
by
weight
number
and
measure
may
be
transferred
without
consent
of
the
owner
refuted
i
having
explained
in
the
preceding
part
the
nature
and
rights
of
property
it
remains
for
us
to
consider
the
obligation
which
we
incur
from
thence
now
this
obligation
proceeds
from
things
either
in
existence
or
not
in
existence
comprehending
under
the
name
of
things
the
right
also
over
persons
as
far
as
is
beneficial
to
us
the
obligation
arising
from
things
in
existence
binds
the
person
who
has
our
property
in
his
power
to
do
all
he
can
to
put
us
again
into
possession
of
it
we
have
said
to
do
all
he
can
for
no
one
is
bound
to
an
impossibility
nor
to
procure
the
restoration
of
a
thing
at
his
own
expence
but
he
is
obliged
to
make
every
discovery
which
may
enable
another
to
recover
his
own
property
for
as
in
a
community
of
things
it
was
necessary
that
a
certain
equality
should
be
preserved
to
prevent
one
man
from
having
an
undue
share
of
the
common
stock
so
upon
the
introduction
of
property
it
became
as
it
were
a
kind
of
established
rule
of
society
among
the
owners
that
the
person
who
had
in
his
possession
anything
belonging
to
another
should
restore
it
to
the
lawful
proprietor
for
if
the
right
of
property
extended
no
farther
than
barely
to
enable
the
owner
to
make
a
demand
of
restitution
without
enforcing
it
by
legal
process
it
would
rest
upon
a
very
weak
foundation
and
scarce
be
worth
the
holding
nor
does
it
make
any
difference
whether
a
person
has
fairly
or
fraudulently
obtained
possession
of
a
thing
not
belonging
to
him
for
he
is
equally
bound
to
restore
it
both
by
the
positive
obligations
of
law
and
by
the
principles
of
natural
justice
the
lacedaemonians
had
nominally
cleared
themselves
of
the
crime
by
condemning
phaebidas
who
in
violation
of
their
treaty
with
the
thebans
had
seized
upon
the
citadel
of
cadmea
but
in
reality
they
where
guilty
of
injustice
by
retaining
the
possession
and
xenophon
has
remarked
that
such
a
singular
act
of
injustice
was
punished
by
the
signal
providence
of
god
for
the
same
reason
marcus
crassus
and
quintus
hortensius
are
blamed
for
having
retained
part
of
an
inheritance
left
them
by
a
will
the
making
of
which
had
been
procured
upon
false
pretences
but
in
the
management
of
which
they
had
no
share
cicero
blames
them
because
it
is
understood
to
be
settled
by
general
agreement
that
all
men
are
to
restore
what
they
are
possessed
of
if
another
is
proved
to
be
the
rightful
owner
a
principle
by
which
property
is
firmly
secured
and
upon
which
all
special
contracts
are
founded
and
any
exceptions
to
this
rule
contained
in
them
must
be
expressly
named
as
such
this
throws
light
upon
the
passage
of
tryphoninus
if
a
robber
has
spoiled
me
of
my
goods
which
he
has
deposited
with
seius
who
knows
nothing
of
the
fact
the
question
is
whether
he
ought
to
restore
them
to
the
robber
or
to
me
if
we
consider
him
as
giving
and
receiving
on
his
own
account
good
faith
requires
that
the
deposit
should
be
restored
to
him
who
gave
it
if
we
consider
the
equity
of
the
whole
case
including
all
the
persons
concerned
in
the
transaction
the
goods
should
be
restored
to
me
as
the
person
unjustly
deprived
of
them
and
he
properly
adds
i
prove
it
to
be
strict
justice
to
assign
every
one
his
due
without
infringing
on
the
more
just
claims
of
another
now
it
has
been
shewn
that
the
justest
title
on
which
any
one
can
claim
is
that
which
is
coaeval
with
the
property
itself
from
whence
the
principle
laid
down
by
tryphoninus
that
if
any
one
unknowingly
received
goods
as
a
deposit
and
afterwards
discovers
them
to
be
his
own
he
is
not
bound
to
restore
them
and
the
question
which
the
same
author
puts
a
little
before
respecting
goods
deposited
by
one
whose
property
had
been
confiscated
is
better
settled
by
this
principle
than
by
what
he
says
elsewhere
on
the
utility
of
punishment
for
as
to
the
nature
of
property
it
makes
no
difference
whether
it
arises
from
the
law
of
nations
or
from
the
civil
law
as
it
always
carries
with
it
peculiar
qualities
among
which
may
be
reckoned
the
obligation
under
which
every
possessor
lies
to
restore
a
thing
to
its
rightful
owner
and
hence
it
is
said
by
martian
that
according
to
the
law
of
nations
restitution
may
be
demanded
of
those
who
have
no
legal
title
to
the
possession
from
the
same
origin
springs
the
maxim
of
ulpian
that
whoever
has
found
a
thing
belonging
to
another
is
bound
to
restore
it
even
without
claiming
or
receiving
a
reward
for
finding
it
the
profits
also
are
to
be
restored
with
a
deduction
only
of
reasonable
charges
ii
respecting
things
or
whose
identity
can
not
be
ascertained
is
a
principle
generally
received
among
mankind
that
the
person
who
has
become
richer
by
that
property
of
which
the
rightful
owner
has
been
dispossessed
is
bound
to
make
him
reparation
in
proportion
to
the
benefit
which
he
has
derived
from
his
property
for
the
true
proprietor
may
be
justly
said
to
have
lost
what
he
has
gained
now
the
very
introduction
of
property
was
intended
to
preserve
that
equality
which
assigns
to
every
one
his
own
cicero
has
said
that
it
is
contrary
to
natural
justice
for
one
man
to
improve
his
own
advantage
at
the
expence
of
another
and
in
another
place
that
nature
does
not
allow
us
to
increase
our
resources
riches
and
power
from
the
spoils
of
others
there
is
so
much
of
equity
in
this
saying
that
many
legal
writers
have
made
it
the
basis
of
their
definitions
to
supply
the
deficiency
of
the
strict
letter
of
the
law
always
appealing
to
equity
as
the
most
sure
and
clear
rule
of
action
if
any
one
employ
a
slave
as
his
factor
to
trade
for
him
he
is
bound
by
the
acts
of
that
factor
unless
he
has
previously
given
notice
that
he
is
not
to
be
trusted
but
even
if
such
notice
has
been
given
where
the
factor
has
a
property
in
the
concern
or
the
master
a
profit
the
notice
shall
be
deemed
a
fraud
for
says
proculus
whoever
makes
an
advantage
from
the
loss
of
another
is
guilty
of
a
fraud
a
term
implying
every
thing
repugnant
to
natural
justice
and
equity
he
who
at
the
instance
of
a
mother
has
put
in
bail
for
her
son
advocate
has
no
action
on
the
case
against
the
advocate
for
what
is
called
an
assumpsit
or
undertaking
for
it
was
not
strictly
his
business
which
the
advocate
managed
the
bail
was
put
in
at
the
instance
of
the
mother
yet
according
to
the
opinion
of
papinian
an
action
on
the
case
for
the
assumpsit
or
undertaking
will
lie
against
the
advocate
because
it
is
with
the
bailor
money
that
he
is
discharged
from
the
risque
of
the
costs
so
a
wife
who
has
given
to
her
husband
money
which
she
may
by
law
demand
again
has
a
personal
action
of
recovery
against
him
or
an
indirect
action
upon
any
thing
purchased
with
the
money
because
as
ulpian
says
it
can
not
be
denied
that
the
husband
has
been
richer
by
it
and
the
question
is
whether
what
he
possesses
belongs
to
his
wife
if
i
have
been
robbed
by
my
slave
and
any
one
has
spent
the
money
under
the
supposition
that
it
was
the
slave
own
property
an
action
may
be
maintained
against
that
person
as
being
unjustly
in
possession
of
my
property
according
to
the
roman
laws
minors
are
not
answerable
for
money
borrowed
yet
if
a
minor
has
become
richer
by
the
loan
an
indirect
action
will
lie
against
him
or
if
anything
belonging
to
another
has
been
pawned
and
sold
by
a
creditor
the
debtor
should
be
released
from
the
debt
in
proportion
to
what
the
creditor
has
received
because
says
tryphoninus
whatever
the
obligation
may
be
since
the
money
raised
accrued
from
the
debt
it
is
more
reasonable
that
it
should
redound
to
the
benefit
of
the
debtor
than
the
creditor
but
the
debtor
is
bound
to
indemnify
the
purchaser
for
it
would
not
be
reasonable
that
he
should
derive
gain
from
another
loss
now
if
a
creditor
holding
an
estate
in
pledge
for
his
money
has
received
from
it
rents
and
profits
amounting
to
more
than
his
real
debt
all
above
that
shall
be
considered
as
a
discharge
of
so
much
of
the
principal
but
to
proceed
with
other
cases
if
you
have
treated
with
my
debtor
not
supposing
him
to
be
indebted
to
me
but
to
another
person
and
have
borrowed
my
money
of
him
you
are
obliged
to
pay
me
not
because
i
have
lent
you
money
for
that
could
only
be
done
by
mutual
consent
but
because
it
is
reasonable
and
just
that
my
money
which
has
come
into
your
possession
should
be
restored
to
me
the
later
writers
on
the
law
have
adduced
this
kind
of
reasoning
in
support
of
similar
cases
thus
for
instance
if
the
goods
of
any
one
who
has
been
cast
through
default
have
been
sold
if
he
can
make
any
good
exception
to
the
decision
he
shall
be
entitled
to
the
money
arising
from
such
sale
again
when
any
one
has
lent
money
to
a
father
for
the
maintenance
of
his
son
if
the
father
should
become
insolvent
he
may
bring
an
action
against
the
son
provided
the
son
is
possessed
of
any
thing
through
his
mother
these
two
rules
being
perfectly
understood
there
will
be
no
difficulty
in
answering
the
questions
often
proposed
by
lawyers
and
theologians
on
such
subjects
iii
in
the
first
place
it
appears
that
a
person
who
has
obtained
possession
of
goods
by
fair
means
is
not
bound
to
restitution
if
those
goods
have
perished
because
they
are
no
longer
in
his
possession
nor
has
he
derived
any
advantage
from
them
the
case
of
unlawful
possession
which
is
left
to
the
punishment
of
the
law
is
entirely
out
of
the
question
iv
in
the
next
place
a
possessor
of
a
thing
is
bound
to
a
restitution
of
the
fruits
or
profits
thereof
remaining
in
his
hand
the
fruits
or
produce
of
the
thing
itself
are
here
meant
for
the
benefit
derived
from
a
thing
owing
to
the
industry
bestowed
upon
it
by
the
occupier
thereof
can
not
belong
to
the
thing
itself
though
originally
proceeding
from
it
the
reason
of
this
obligation
arises
from
the
institution
of
property
for
the
true
proprietor
of
a
possession
is
naturally
proprietor
of
the
fruits
or
produce
of
the
same
such
possessor
in
the
third
place
is
bound
to
make
restitution
of
the
thing
or
reparation
for
the
consumption
of
it
occasioned
by
his
possession
for
he
is
conceived
to
have
been
made
the
richer
thereby
thus
caligula
is
praised
for
having
in
the
beginning
of
his
reign
restored
to
different
princes
along
with
their
crowns
the
intermediate
revenues
of
their
kingdoms
vi
in
the
fourth
place
an
occupier
of
lands
for
instance
is
not
bound
to
make
a
compensation
for
the
produce
thereof
which
he
has
not
reaped
for
if
dispossessed
he
has
neither
the
thing
itself
nor
any
thing
in
the
place
of
it
vii
in
the
fifth
place
a
possessor
who
has
granted
to
a
third
person
a
thing
of
which
a
gift
had
been
made
to
himself
is
not
bound
to
make
a
recompence
to
the
original
giver
unless
he
received
it
under
stipulation
that
if
he
granted
it
to
a
third
person
and
thereby
spared
his
own
property
he
should
make
a
return
proportionable
to
such
gain
viii
sixthly
if
any
one
has
sold
a
thing
which
he
has
bought
he
is
not
bound
to
restitution
of
more
than
the
surplus
arising
from
the
sale
but
if
he
had
received
it
under
stipulation
to
sell
he
is
bound
to
make
restitution
of
the
whole
price
unless
in
transacting
the
sale
he
has
incurred
an
expence
amounting
to
the
whole
price
which
he
would
not
otherwise
have
done
ix
seventhly
a
purchaser
of
what
belongs
to
another
is
obliged
to
make
restitution
to
the
real
owner
nor
can
the
price
he
paid
be
recovered
to
this
however
there
seems
to
be
one
exception
which
is
where
the
owner
could
not
have
recovered
possession
without
some
expence
so
for
instance
if
his
property
were
in
the
hands
of
pirates
for
then
a
deduction
may
be
made
of
as
much
as
the
owner
would
willingly
have
spent
in
the
recovery
because
the
actual
possession
especially
of
a
thing
difficult
to
be
recovered
may
be
ascertained
and
the
owner
deemed
so
much
the
richer
by
such
recovery
and
therefore
though
in
the
ordinary
course
of
law
the
purchase
of
what
belongs
to
one
self
can
never
constitute
a
bargain
yet
paulus
the
lawyer
says
that
it
may
do
so
if
it
has
been
originally
agreed
that
we
are
to
pay
for
the
of
what
another
has
belonging
to
us
in
his
hands
nor
is
it
in
the
least
material
whether
a
thing
has
been
bought
with
an
intention
of
restoring
it
to
the
owner
in
which
case
some
say
that
an
action
for
costs
may
be
maintained
whilst
others
deny
it
for
an
action
on
the
case
to
recover
a
compensation
for
business
done
arises
from
the
artificial
rules
of
civil
law
and
not
solely
from
the
simple
dictates
of
natural
justice
which
are
here
the
principal
subject
of
inquiry
not
unlike
to
this
is
what
ulpian
has
written
on
funeral
expences
in
which
he
says
that
a
compassionate
judge
will
not
rigidly
regard
the
bare
labour
that
has
been
given
but
allowing
some
relaxation
in
favour
of
equity
will
shew
indulgence
to
the
feelings
of
human
nature
the
same
writer
in
another
place
has
said
that
if
any
one
has
transacted
my
business
not
out
of
regard
to
me
but
for
his
own
interest
and
has
incurred
expence
on
my
account
he
may
bring
an
action
on
the
case
not
for
what
he
has
given
but
for
what
i
have
gained
by
his
labour
and
expence
in
the
same
manner
owners
by
throwing
whose
goods
overboard
a
ship
has
been
lightened
may
recover
a
compensation
from
others
whose
goods
were
by
that
means
saved
because
those
persons
are
considered
so
much
the
richer
by
the
preservation
of
what
would
otherwise
have
been
lost
eighthly
the
person
that
has
bought
a
thing
of
one
who
is
not
the
owner
can
not
return
it
to
that
seller
because
from
the
time
that
the
thing
came
into
his
possession
he
incurred
an
obligation
to
restore
it
to
the
lawful
owner
xi
again
if
any
one
is
in
possession
of
a
thing
whose
real
owner
is
unknown
he
is
not
naturally
and
necessarily
bound
to
give
it
to
the
poor
although
this
may
be
considered
as
an
act
of
piety
a
custom
very
properly
established
in
some
places
the
reason
of
which
is
founded
on
the
introduction
of
property
for
in
consequence
of
that
no
one
except
the
real
owner
can
claim
a
right
to
any
thing
to
the
person
therefore
who
can
not
discover
such
an
owner
it
is
the
same
as
if
there
really
were
none
xii
lastly
a
person
is
not
obliged
by
the
law
of
nature
to
restore
money
which
has
been
received
upon
a
dishonest
account
or
for
the
performance
of
a
legal
act
to
which
that
person
was
of
himself
bound
however
it
is
not
without
reason
that
some
laws
have
required
restitution
in
such
cases
the
reason
of
this
is
because
no
one
is
bound
to
part
with
any
thing
unless
it
belongs
to
another
but
here
the
property
is
voluntarily
transferred
by
the
first
owner
the
case
will
be
altered
if
there
be
any
thing
iniquitous
in
the
manner
of
acquiring
the
thing
as
if
for
instance
it
be
gained
by
extortion
this
gives
rise
to
the
obligation
of
submitting
to
penalties
which
is
not
immediately
to
the
present
purpose
xiii
the
present
subject
may
be
concluded
with
a
refutation
of
medina
false
opinion
that
a
property
in
things
belonging
to
another
may
be
transferred
without
consent
of
the
owner
provided
the
things
are
such
as
are
usually
valued
by
weight
number
and
measure
because
things
of
that
nature
can
be
repaid
in
kind
or
by
an
equivalent
but
this
is
only
where
such
a
mode
of
repayment
has
been
previously
agreed
upon
or
where
it
is
understood
to
be
established
by
law
or
custom
or
where
the
thing
itself
has
been
consumed
and
can
not
be
identically
restored
but
without
such
consent
either
expressed
or
implied
or
excepting
the
impossibility
just
mentioned
the
things
themselves
must
be
restored

i
the
course
of
the
subject
next
leads
to
an
inquiry
into
the
obligation
of
promises
where
the
first
object
that
presents
itself
is
the
opinion
of
franciscus
connanus
a
man
of
no
ordinary
learning
he
maintains
an
opinion
that
the
law
of
nature
and
of
nations
does
not
enforce
the
fulfilment
of
those
agreements
which
do
not
include
an
express
contract
yet
the
fulfilment
of
them
is
right
in
cases
where
even
without
a
promise
the
performance
would
be
consonant
to
virtue
and
equity
in
support
of
his
opinion
he
brings
not
only
the
sayings
of
lawyers
but
likewise
the
following
reasons
he
says
that
the
person
who
makes
and
he
who
believes
a
rash
promise
are
equally
to
blame
for
the
fortunes
of
all
men
would
be
in
imminent
danger
if
they
were
bound
by
such
promises
which
often
proceed
from
motives
of
vanity
rather
than
from
a
settled
deliberation
and
are
the
result
of
a
light
and
inconsiderate
mind
lastly
the
performance
of
whatever
is
any
way
just
in
itself
ought
to
be
left
to
the
free
will
of
every
one
and
not
exacted
according
to
the
rigid
rules
of
necessity
he
says
that
it
is
shameful
not
to
fulfil
promises
not
because
it
is
unjust
but
because
it
argues
a
levity
in
making
them
in
support
of
his
opinion
he
appeals
also
to
the
testimony
of
tully
who
has
said
that
those
promises
are
not
to
be
kept
which
are
prejudicial
to
the
person
to
whom
they
are
made
nor
if
they
are
more
detrimental
to
the
giver
than
beneficial
to
the
receiver
but
if
the
performance
of
an
engagement
is
begun
upon
the
strength
of
a
promise
but
not
finished
he
does
not
require
a
complete
fulfilment
of
the
promise
but
only
some
compensation
to
the
party
for
the
disappointment
agreements
he
continues
have
no
intrinsic
force
of
obligation
but
only
what
they
derive
from
the
express
contracts
in
which
they
are
included
or
to
which
they
are
annexed
or
from
the
delivery
of
the
thing
promised
from
whence
arise
actions
on
the
one
side
and
exceptions
on
the
other
and
bars
to
all
claims
of
recovery
but
it
is
through
favour
of
the
laws
alone
which
give
the
efficacy
of
obligation
to
what
is
only
fair
and
equitable
in
itself
that
obligatory
agreements
such
as
express
covenants
and
other
things
of
that
kind
derive
their
force
now
there
is
no
consistency
in
this
opinion
taken
in
the
general
sense
intended
by
its
author
for
in
the
first
place
it
immediately
follows
from
thence
that
there
is
no
force
in
treaties
between
kings
and
different
nations
till
some
part
of
them
be
carried
into
execution
especially
in
those
places
where
no
certain
form
of
treaties
or
compacts
has
been
established
but
no
just
reason
can
be
found
why
laws
which
are
a
kind
of
general
agreement
among
a
people
and
indeed
are
called
so
by
aristotle
and
demosthenes
should
be
able
to
give
the
force
of
obligation
to
compacts
and
why
the
will
of
an
individual
doing
every
thing
to
bind
himself
should
not
have
the
same
power
especially
where
the
civil
law
creates
no
impediment
to
it
besides
as
it
has
been
already
said
that
the
property
of
a
thing
may
be
transferred
where
a
sufficient
indication
of
the
will
is
given
why
may
we
not
then
convey
to
another
the
right
to
claim
a
transfer
of
our
property
to
him
or
the
fulfilment
of
our
engagements
as
we
have
the
same
power
over
our
actions
as
over
our
property
this
is
an
opinion
confirmed
by
the
wisdom
of
all
ages
for
as
it
is
said
by
legal
authorities
that
since
nothing
is
so
consonant
to
natural
justice
as
for
the
will
of
an
owner
freely
transferring
his
property
to
another
to
be
confirmed
so
nothing
is
more
conducive
to
good
faith
among
men
than
a
strict
adherence
to
the
engagements
they
have
made
with
each
other
thus
a
legal
decision
for
the
payment
of
money
where
no
debt
has
been
incurred
except
by
the
verbal
consent
of
the
party
promising
is
thought
conformable
to
natural
justice
paulus
the
lawyer
also
says
that
the
law
of
nature
and
the
law
of
nations
agree
in
compelling
a
person
who
has
received
credit
to
payment
in
this
place
the
word
compelling
signifies
a
moral
obligation
nor
can
what
connanus
says
be
admitted
which
is
that
we
are
supposed
to
have
credit
for
a
full
performance
of
a
promise
where
the
engagement
has
been
in
part
fulfilled
for
paulus
in
this
place
is
treating
of
an
action
where
nothing
is
due
which
action
is
entirely
void
if
money
has
been
paid
in
any
way
whether
according
to
the
manner
expressly
stipulated
or
any
other
for
the
civil
law
in
order
to
discourage
frequent
causes
of
litigation
does
not
interfere
with
those
agreements
which
are
enforced
by
the
law
of
nature
and
of
nations
tully
in
the
first
book
of
his
offices
assigns
such
force
to
the
obligation
of
promises
that
he
calls
fidelity
the
foundation
of
justice
which
horace
also
styles
the
sister
of
justice
and
the
platonists
often
call
justice
truth
which
apuleius
has
translated
fidelity
and
simonides
has
defined
justice
to
be
not
only
returning
what
one
has
received
but
also
speaking
the
truth
but
to
understand
the
matter
fully
we
must
carefully
observe
that
there
are
three
different
ways
of
speaking
respecting
things
which
are
or
which
it
is
supposed
will
be
in
our
power
ii
the
first
of
these
ways
is
where
an
assurance
is
given
of
future
intentions
and
if
the
assurance
be
sincere
at
the
time
it
is
given
though
it
should
not
be
carried
into
effect
no
blame
is
incurred
as
it
might
afterwards
not
be
found
expedient
for
the
human
mind
has
not
only
a
natural
power
but
a
right
to
change
its
purpose
wherefore
if
any
blame
attaches
to
a
change
of
opinion
or
purpose
it
is
not
to
be
imputed
to
the
bare
act
of
changing
but
to
the
circumstances
under
which
it
happens
especially
when
the
former
resolution
was
the
best
iii
the
second
way
is
when
future
intentions
are
expressed
by
outward
acts
and
signs
sufficient
to
indicate
a
resolution
of
abiding
by
present
assurances
and
these
kind
of
promises
may
be
called
imperfect
obligations
but
conveying
to
the
person
to
whom
they
are
given
no
right
to
exact
them
for
it
happens
in
many
cases
that
we
may
be
under
an
obligation
of
duty
to
the
performance
of
which
another
has
no
right
to
compel
us
for
in
this
respect
the
duty
of
fidelity
to
promises
is
like
the
duties
of
compassion
and
gratitude
in
such
kinds
of
promises
therefore
the
person
to
whom
they
are
made
has
no
right
by
the
law
of
nature
to
possess
himself
of
the
effects
of
the
promiser
as
his
own
nor
to
compel
him
to
the
performance
of
his
promise
iv
the
third
way
is
where
such
a
determination
is
confirmed
by
evident
signs
of
an
intention
to
convey
a
peculiar
right
to
another
which
constitutes
the
perfect
obligation
of
a
promise
and
is
attended
with
consequences
similar
to
an
alienation
of
property
there
may
be
two
kinds
of
alienation
the
one
of
our
property
the
other
of
a
certain
portion
of
our
liberty
under
those
of
the
former
kind
we
may
class
the
promises
of
gifts
and
under
the
latter
the
promises
of
doing
certain
actions
on
this
subject
we
are
supplied
with
noble
arguments
from
the
divine
oracles
which
inform
us
that
god
himself
who
can
be
limited
by
no
established
rules
of
law
would
act
contrary
to
his
own
nature
if
he
did
not
perform
his
promises
from
whence
it
follows
that
the
obligations
to
perform
promises
spring
from
the
nature
of
that
unchangeable
justice
which
is
an
attribute
of
god
and
common
to
all
who
bear
his
image
in
the
use
of
reason
to
the
proofs
of
scripture
here
referred
to
we
may
add
the
judgment
of
solomon
my
son
if
thou
hast
been
surety
for
thy
friend
thou
hast
tied
up
thy
hands
to
a
stranger
thou
art
ensnared
by
the
words
of
thy
mouth
then
art
thou
taken
by
the
words
of
thine
own
mouth
hence
a
promise
is
called
by
the
hebrews
a
bond
or
chain
and
is
compared
to
a
vow
eustathius
in
his
notes
on
the
second
book
of
the
iliad
assigns
a
similar
origin
to
the
word
ὑποσχεσεως
hyposcheseôs
or
engagement
for
he
who
has
received
the
promise
in
some
measure
takes
and
holds
the
person
that
has
made
the
engagement
a
meaning
not
ill
expressed
by
ovid
in
the
second
book
of
his
metamorphoses
where
the
promiser
says
to
him
to
whom
he
had
promised
my
word
has
become
yours
after
knowing
this
there
remains
no
difficulty
in
replying
to
the
arguments
of
connanus
for
the
expressions
of
the
lawyers
respecting
bare
promises
refer
only
to
what
was
introduced
by
the
roman
laws
which
have
made
a
formal
stipulation
the
undoubted
sign
of
a
deliberate
mind
nor
can
it
be
denied
that
there
were
similar
laws
among
other
nations
for
seneca
speaking
of
human
laws
and
promises
made
without
proper
solemnities
says
what
law
any
country
we
may
obliges
us
to
the
performance
of
bare
promises
but
there
may
naturally
be
other
signs
of
a
deliberate
mind
besides
a
formal
stipulation
or
any
other
similar
act
which
the
civil
law
requires
to
afford
grounds
for
a
legal
remedy
but
what
is
not
done
with
a
deliberate
mind
we
are
inclined
to
believe
does
not
come
under
the
class
of
perfect
obligations
as
theophrastus
has
observed
in
his
book
on
laws
nay
even
what
is
done
with
a
deliberate
mind
but
not
with
an
intention
of
conceding
our
own
right
to
another
though
it
can
not
give
any
one
a
natural
right
of
exacting
its
fulfilment
yet
it
creates
an
obligation
not
only
in
point
of
duty
but
in
point
of
moral
necessity
the
next
matter
to
be
considered
is
what
are
the
requisites
to
constitute
a
perfect
promise
the
use
of
reason
is
the
first
requisite
to
constitute
the
obligation
of
a
promise
which
ideots
madmen
and
infants
are
consequently
incapable
of
making
the
case
of
minors
is
somewhat
different
for
although
they
may
not
have
a
sound
judgment
yet
it
is
not
a
permanent
defect
nor
sufficient
of
itself
to
invalidate
all
their
acts
it
can
not
be
certainly
defined
at
what
period
of
life
reason
commences
but
it
must
be
judged
of
from
daily
actions
or
from
the
particular
customs
of
each
country
amongst
the
hebrews
a
promise
made
by
a
male
at
the
age
of
thirteen
and
by
a
female
at
the
age
of
twelve
was
valid
in
other
nations
the
civil
laws
acting
upon
just
motives
declare
certain
promises
made
by
wards
and
minors
to
be
void
not
only
among
the
romans
but
among
the
greeks
also
as
it
has
been
observed
by
dion
chrysostom
in
his
oration
to
do
away
the
effect
of
improvident
promises
some
laws
introduce
actions
of
recovery
or
restitution
but
such
regulations
are
peculiar
to
the
civil
law
and
have
no
immediate
connection
with
the
law
of
nature
and
of
nations
any
farther
than
that
wherever
they
are
established
it
is
consonant
to
natural
justice
that
they
should
be
observed
wherefore
if
a
foreigner
enter
into
an
agreement
with
a
citizen
or
subject
of
any
other
country
he
will
be
bound
by
the
laws
of
that
country
to
which
during
his
residence
therein
he
owes
a
temporary
obedience
but
the
case
is
different
where
an
agreement
is
made
upon
the
open
sea
or
in
a
desert
island
or
by
letters
of
correspondence
for
such
contracts
are
regulated
by
the
law
of
nature
alone
in
the
same
manner
as
compacts
made
by
sovereigns
in
their
public
capacity
vi
the
consideration
of
promises
made
under
an
error
is
a
subject
of
some
intricacy
for
it
in
general
makes
a
difference
whether
the
promiser
knew
the
full
extent
of
his
promise
and
the
value
of
the
thing
promised
or
not
or
whether
the
contract
which
was
made
originated
in
fraudulent
intention
or
not
or
whether
one
of
the
parties
was
privy
to
the
fraud
and
whether
the
fulfilment
of
it
was
an
act
of
strict
justice
or
only
of
good
faith
for
according
to
the
variety
of
these
circumstances
writers
pronounce
some
acts
void
and
others
valid
leaving
the
injured
party
a
discretionary
power
to
rescind
or
amend
them
most
of
these
distinctions
originate
in
the
ancient
civil
and
praetorian
roman
law
though
some
of
them
are
not
strictly
founded
in
reason
and
truth
but
the
most
obvious
and
natural
way
of
discovering
the
truth
is
by
referring
to
laws
which
derive
their
force
and
efficacy
from
the
general
consent
of
mankind
so
that
if
a
law
rests
upon
the
presumption
of
any
fact
which
in
reality
has
no
existence
such
a
law
is
not
binding
for
when
no
evidence
of
the
fact
can
be
produced
the
entire
foundation
on
which
that
law
rests
must
fail
but
we
must
have
recourse
to
the
subject
to
the
words
and
circumstances
of
a
law
to
determine
when
it
is
founded
on
such
a
presumption
the
same
rule
applies
to
the
interpretation
of
promises
for
where
they
are
made
upon
the
supposition
of
a
fact
which
in
the
end
proves
not
to
be
true
they
lose
the
force
of
obligations
because
the
promiser
made
them
upon
certain
conditions
only
the
fulfilment
of
which
becomes
impossible
cicero
in
his
first
book
on
the
talents
and
character
of
an
orator
puts
the
case
of
a
father
who
under
the
supposition
or
intelligence
that
his
son
was
dead
promised
to
devise
his
property
to
his
nephew
but
the
supposition
proving
erroneous
and
the
intelligence
false
the
father
was
released
from
the
obligation
of
the
promise
made
to
his
relative
but
if
the
promiser
has
neglected
to
examine
the
matter
or
has
been
careless
in
expressing
his
meaning
he
will
be
bound
to
repair
the
damage
which
another
has
sustained
on
that
account
this
obligation
is
not
built
on
the
strength
of
the
promise
but
on
the
injury
which
it
has
occasioned
an
erroneous
promise
will
be
binding
if
the
error
was
not
the
occasion
of
the
promise
for
here
there
is
no
want
of
consent
in
the
party
who
made
it
but
if
the
promise
was
obtained
by
fraud
the
person
so
obtaining
it
shall
indemnify
the
promiser
for
the
injury
sustained
if
there
has
been
any
partial
error
in
the
promise
yet
in
other
respects
it
shall
be
deemed
valid
vii
promises
extorted
by
fear
are
a
subject
of
no
less
intricate
decision
for
here
too
a
distinction
is
usually
made
between
a
well
founded
and
a
chimerical
fear
between
a
just
fear
and
a
bare
suspicion
and
between
the
persons
who
occasion
it
whether
it
be
the
person
to
whom
the
promise
is
given
or
some
other
a
distinction
is
also
made
between
acts
purely
gratuitous
and
those
in
which
both
parties
have
an
interest
for
according
to
all
this
variety
of
circumstances
some
engagements
are
considered
as
void
others
as
revocable
at
the
pleasure
or
discretion
of
the
maker
and
others
as
warranting
a
claim
to
indemnity
for
the
inconvenience
occasioned
but
on
each
of
these
points
there
is
great
diversity
of
opinion
there
is
some
shew
of
reason
in
the
opinion
of
those
who
without
taking
into
consideration
the
power
of
the
civil
law
to
annul
or
diminish
an
obligation
maintain
that
a
person
is
bound
to
fulfil
a
promise
which
he
has
given
under
impressions
of
fear
for
even
in
this
case
there
was
consent
though
it
was
extorted
neither
was
it
conditional
as
in
erroneous
promises
but
absolute
it
is
called
consent
for
as
aristotle
has
observed
those
who
consent
to
throw
their
goods
overboard
in
a
storm
would
have
saved
them
had
it
not
been
for
the
fear
of
shipwreck
but
they
freely
part
with
them
considering
all
the
circumstances
of
time
and
place
viii
to
render
a
promise
valid
it
must
be
such
as
it
is
in
the
power
of
the
promiser
to
perform
for
which
reason
no
promises
to
do
illegal
acts
are
valid
because
no
one
either
has
or
ever
can
have
a
right
to
do
them
but
a
promise
as
was
said
before
derives
all
its
force
from
the
right
of
the
promiser
to
make
it
nor
can
it
extend
beyond
that
if
a
thing
is
not
now
in
the
power
of
the
promiser
but
may
be
so
at
some
future
time
the
obligation
will
remain
in
suspense
for
the
promise
was
only
made
under
the
expectation
of
some
future
ability
to
fulfil
it
but
if
a
person
has
a
controul
over
the
condition
upon
which
the
promise
is
made
to
realise
it
or
not
he
lies
under
a
moral
obligation
to
use
every
endeavour
to
fulfil
it
but
in
obligations
of
this
kind
also
the
civil
law
from
obvious
motives
of
general
utility
occasionally
interposes
its
authority
to
make
them
void
obligations
which
the
law
of
nature
would
have
confirmed
ix
the
next
general
inquiry
for
the
most
part
refers
to
the
validity
of
promises
made
upon
any
immoral
or
unlawful
consideration
as
if
for
instance
any
thing
is
promised
to
another
on
condition
of
his
committing
a
murder
here
the
very
promise
itself
is
wicked
and
unlawful
because
it
encourages
the
commission
of
a
crime
but
it
does
not
follow
every
foolish
or
improvident
promise
loses
the
force
of
an
obligation
as
in
the
confirmation
of
imprudent
or
prodigal
grants
for
no
further
evil
can
result
from
a
confirmation
of
what
has
been
already
given
and
the
invalidity
of
promises
would
be
a
greater
evil
than
any
that
could
result
from
a
confirmation
of
the
most
improvident
but
in
promises
made
upon
immoral
and
unlawful
considerations
there
is
always
a
criminality
remaining
even
while
they
continue
unfulfilled
for
during
the
whole
of
that
time
the
expectation
of
fulfilment
carries
with
it
the
indelible
mark
of
encouragement
to
the
commission
of
a
crime
xii
we
are
obliged
to
confirm
the
engagements
made
by
others
acting
in
our
name
if
it
is
evident
that
they
had
special
or
general
instructions
from
us
to
do
so
and
in
granting
a
commission
with
full
powers
to
any
one
it
may
so
happen
that
we
are
bound
by
the
conduct
of
that
agent
even
if
he
exceed
the
secret
instructions
which
he
has
received
for
he
acts
upon
that
ostensible
authority
by
which
we
are
bound
to
ratify
whatever
he
does
although
we
may
have
bound
him
to
do
nothing
but
according
to
his
private
instructions
this
rule
we
must
observe
applies
to
the
promises
made
by
ambassadors
in
the
name
of
their
sovereigns
when
by
virtue
of
their
public
credentials
they
have
exceeded
their
private
orders
xiii
from
the
preceding
arguments
it
is
easy
to
understand
how
far
owners
of
ships
are
answerable
for
the
acts
of
the
masters
employed
by
them
in
those
vessels
or
merchants
for
the
conduct
of
their
factors
for
natural
equity
will
qualify
the
actions
brought
against
them
according
to
the
instructions
and
powers
which
they
give
so
that
we
may
justly
condemn
the
rigour
of
the
roman
law
in
making
the
owners
of
ships
absolutely
bound
by
all
the
acts
of
the
masters
employed
for
this
is
neither
consonant
to
natural
equity
which
holds
it
sufficient
for
each
party
to
be
answerable
in
proportion
to
his
share
nor
is
it
conducive
to
the
public
good
for
men
would
be
deterred
from
employing
ships
if
they
lay
under
the
perpetual
fear
of
being
answerable
for
the
acts
of
their
masters
to
an
unlimited
extent
and
therefore
in
holland
a
country
where
trade
has
flourished
with
the
greatest
vigour
the
roman
law
has
never
been
observed
either
now
or
at
any
former
period
on
the
contrary
it
is
an
established
rule
that
no
action
can
be
maintained
against
the
owner
for
any
greater
sum
than
the
value
of
the
ship
and
cargo
for
a
promise
to
convey
a
right
acceptance
is
no
less
necessary
than
in
a
transfer
of
property
and
in
this
case
there
is
supposed
to
have
been
a
precedent
request
which
is
the
same
as
acceptance
nor
is
this
contradicted
by
the
promises
which
the
civil
law
implies
every
one
to
have
made
to
the
state
without
any
request
or
formal
acceptance
xiv
a
reason
which
has
induced
some
to
believe
that
the
sole
act
of
a
promiser
by
the
law
of
nature
is
sufficient
our
first
position
is
not
contradicted
by
the
roman
law
for
it
no
where
says
that
a
promise
has
its
full
effect
before
acceptance
but
only
forbids
the
revocation
of
it
which
might
prevent
acceptance
and
this
effect
results
not
from
natural
but
from
purely
legal
rules
xv
another
question
is
whether
the
acceptance
alone
of
a
promise
is
sufficient
or
whether
it
ought
to
be
communicated
to
the
promiser
before
it
can
be
made
binding
it
is
certain
that
a
promise
may
be
made
two
ways
either
upon
condition
of
its
being
fulfilled
if
accepted
or
upon
condition
of
its
being
ratified
if
the
promiser
is
apprised
of
its
being
accepted
and
in
cases
of
mutual
obligation
it
is
presumed
to
be
taken
in
the
latter
sense
but
it
is
better
to
take
promises
that
are
purely
gratuitous
in
the
former
sense
unless
there
be
evidence
to
the
contrary
xvi
from
hence
it
follows
that
a
promise
may
be
revoked
without
the
imputation
of
injustice
or
levity
before
acceptance
as
no
right
has
yet
been
conveyed
especially
if
acceptance
were
made
the
condition
of
its
being
fulfilled
it
may
be
revoked
too
if
the
party
to
whom
it
was
made
should
die
before
acceptance
because
it
is
evident
that
the
power
to
accept
it
or
not
was
conferred
upon
him
and
not
upon
his
heirs
for
to
give
a
man
a
right
which
may
possibly
descend
to
his
heirs
is
one
thing
and
to
express
an
intention
of
giving
it
to
his
heirs
is
another
for
it
makes
an
essential
difference
upon
what
person
the
favour
is
conferred
this
is
understood
in
the
answer
made
by
neratius
who
said
that
he
did
not
believe
the
prince
would
have
granted
to
one
who
was
dead
what
he
granted
supposing
him
still
alive
xvii
a
promise
may
be
revoked
by
the
death
of
the
person
appointed
to
communicate
to
a
third
the
intention
of
the
promiser
because
the
obligation
to
the
third
person
rested
upon
such
communication
the
case
is
different
where
a
public
messenger
is
employed
who
is
not
himself
the
obligatory
instrument
but
only
the
means
through
which
it
is
conveyed
therefore
letters
indicating
a
promise
or
consent
may
be
conveyed
by
any
one
yet
there
is
a
distinction
to
be
made
between
a
minister
appointed
to
communicate
a
promise
and
one
appointed
to
make
the
promise
in
his
own
name
for
in
the
former
case
a
revocation
will
be
valid
even
though
it
has
not
been
made
known
to
the
minister
employed
but
in
the
latter
case
it
will
be
entirely
void
because
the
right
of
promising
was
committed
to
the
minister
and
fully
depended
upon
his
will
therefore
the
obligation
of
the
promise
was
complete
as
he
knew
of
no
intended
revocation
so
also
in
the
former
case
where
a
second
person
is
commissioned
to
communicate
the
intentions
of
a
donor
to
a
third
even
if
the
donor
should
die
the
acceptance
of
the
gift
will
be
deemed
valid
all
that
was
requisite
being
performed
on
one
part
though
till
that
period
the
intention
was
revocable
as
is
evident
in
the
case
of
bequests
but
in
the
other
case
where
a
person
has
received
a
full
commission
to
execute
a
promise
during
the
life
of
the
donor
should
the
donor
die
before
the
execution
of
it
and
the
person
employed
be
apprised
of
his
death
the
commission
the
promise
and
the
acceptance
of
it
will
then
at
once
become
void
in
doubtful
cases
it
is
reasonable
to
suppose
that
it
was
the
intention
of
the
promiser
that
the
commission
which
he
gave
should
be
executed
unless
some
great
change
as
for
instance
his
own
death
should
occur
yet
reasons
in
favour
of
a
contrary
opinion
may
easily
be
found
and
admitted
especially
with
respect
to
pious
donations
which
at
all
events
ought
to
stand
good
and
in
the
same
manner
may
be
decided
the
long
disputed
question
whether
an
action
on
account
of
such
a
bequest
could
be
brought
against
the
heir
upon
which
the
author
of
the
second
book
to
herennius
says
that
marcus
drusus
the
praetor
decided
one
way
and
sextus
julius
another
xviii
the
acceptance
of
a
promise
for
a
third
person
is
a
matter
subject
to
discussion
in
which
there
is
a
distinction
to
be
observed
between
a
promise
made
to
a
person
of
a
thing
which
is
to
be
given
to
another
and
a
promise
made
directly
to
the
person
himself
on
whom
the
former
is
to
be
conferred
if
a
promise
is
made
to
any
one
where
his
own
personal
interest
is
not
concerned
a
consideration
introduced
by
the
roman
law
by
acceptance
he
seems
naturally
to
acquire
a
right
which
may
be
transferred
to
another
for
his
acceptance
and
this
right
will
pass
so
fully
that
in
the
mean
time
the
promise
can
not
be
revoked
by
the
person
who
gave
though
it
may
be
released
by
him
who
received
it
for
that
is
a
meaning
by
no
means
repugnant
to
the
law
of
nature
and
it
is
entirely
conformable
to
the
words
of
such
a
promise
nor
can
it
be
a
matter
of
indifference
to
the
person
through
whom
another
is
to
receive
a
benefit
but
if
a
promise
is
made
directly
to
one
on
whom
a
thing
is
to
be
conferred
a
distinction
must
be
made
whether
the
person
receiving
such
a
promise
has
special
commission
for
acceptance
or
one
so
general
as
to
include
acceptance
or
has
it
not
when
a
commission
has
been
previously
given
no
farther
distinction
is
necessary
whether
the
person
be
free
or
not
a
condition
which
the
roman
laws
require
but
it
is
plain
that
from
such
an
acceptance
let
the
condition
of
the
person
be
what
it
will
the
promise
is
complete
because
consent
may
be
given
and
signified
through
the
medium
of
another
for
a
person
is
supposed
to
have
fully
intended
what
he
has
put
into
the
power
of
another
to
accept
or
refuse
where
there
is
no
such
commission
if
another
to
whom
the
promise
was
not
directly
made
accepts
it
with
the
consent
of
the
promiser
the
promise
will
be
so
far
binding
that
the
promiser
will
not
be
at
liberty
to
revoke
it
before
the
person
in
whose
favour
it
was
made
has
ratified
and
afterwards
chosen
to
release
the
engagement
yet
in
the
mean
time
the
accepter
can
not
release
it
as
having
derived
no
peculiar
right
from
it
himself
but
only
been
used
as
an
instrument
in
promoting
the
kind
intentions
and
good
faith
of
the
promiser
the
promiser
therefore
himself
by
revoking
it
is
not
doing
violence
to
the
perfect
right
of
another
but
only
acting
in
contradiction
his
own
good
faith
xix
from
what
has
been
said
before
it
is
easy
to
conceive
what
opinion
ought
to
be
entertained
of
a
burdensome
condition
annexed
to
a
promise
for
it
may
be
annexed
at
any
time
till
a
promise
has
been
completed
by
acceptance
or
an
irrevocable
pledge
to
fulfil
it
has
been
given
but
the
condition
of
a
burden
annexed
to
a
favour
intended
to
be
conferred
upon
a
third
person
through
the
medium
of
any
one
may
be
revoked
before
the
person
has
confirmed
it
by
his
acceptance
on
this
point
there
is
great
difference
of
opinion
but
upon
impartial
consideration
the
natural
equity
of
any
case
may
be
easily
seen
without
any
great
length
of
arguments
xx
xxi
xxii
another
point
of
discussion
relates
to
the
validity
of
an
erroneous
promise
when
the
person
who
made
it
upon
being
apprised
of
his
error
is
willing
to
adhere
to
his
engagement
and
the
same
inquiry
applies
to
promises
which
arising
out
of
fear
or
any
other
such
motive
are
prohibited
by
the
civil
law
what
it
may
be
asked
will
become
of
these
promises
if
that
fear
or
that
motive
has
been
removed
to
confirm
such
obligations
some
think
an
internal
consent
of
the
mind
alone
in
conjunction
with
some
previous
external
act
is
sufficient
others
disapprove
of
this
opinion
because
they
do
not
admit
that
an
external
act
is
a
real
sign
of
a
subsequent
intention
therefore
they
require
an
express
repetition
of
the
promise
and
acceptance
between
these
two
opinions
the
truth
is
most
likely
to
be
found
there
may
be
an
external
act
expressive
of
a
promise
though
unaccompanied
with
words
where
one
party
accepting
and
retaining
a
gift
and
the
other
relinquishing
his
right
in
it
are
sufficient
to
constitute
a
full
consent
to
prevent
civil
laws
from
being
confounded
with
natural
justice
we
must
not
omit
noticing
in
this
place
that
promises
though
founded
in
no
express
motive
are
not
any
more
than
gifts
void
by
the
law
of
nature
nor
is
a
person
who
has
engaged
for
another
performing
any
thing
bound
to
pay
damages
and
interest
for
neglect
provided
he
has
done
every
thing
that
was
necessary
on
his
part
towards
obtaining
its
accomplishment
unless
the
express
terms
of
the
agreement
or
the
nature
of
the
business
require
a
stricter
obligation
positively
declaring
that
under
all
circumstances
whatever
the
thing
shall
be
performed

are
those

without

alienation
or
where
labour
is
given
in

under
the
first
of
these
heads
we
may
reckon
the
loan
and
use
of
all
consumable
or
inconsumable
property
and
under
the
latter
we
may
place
all
commissions
to
transact
business
or
all
trusts
to
preserve
the
property
of
another
similar
to
which
are
all
promises
of
something
to
be
done
except
that
they
regard
a
future
time
and
in
this
view
we
may
consider
all
the
actions
which
are
now
to
be
explained
iii
in
all
acts
of
exchange
there
is
either
an
adjustment
of
shares
or
the
profits
are
regarded
as
a
common
stock
and
such
adjustments
are
made
by
the
roman
lawyers
in
the
following
terms
i
give
this
to
receive
that
in
return
i
do
this
in
order
for
you
to
do
that
or
i
do
this
for
you
to
give
me
that
but
the
romans
exclude
from
that
adjustment
certain
kinds
of
contracts
which
they
call
express
engagements
not
because
they
are
entitled
to
any
such
peculiar
name
more
than
the
simple
acts
of
exchange
already
mentioned
but
because
from
frequent
use
they
have
naturally
derived
a
character
similar
to
that
of
the
original
contract
from
which
they
are
named
though
they
are
not
attended
exactly
with
the
same
circumstances
nor
expressed
directly
in
the
same
terms
whereas
in
other
contracts
less
frequently
in
use
the
form
was
confined
to
an
exact
statement
of
all
the
circumstances
of
the
case
an
action
upon
which
was
therefore
called
by
the
roman
law
an
action
in
prescribed
words
for
the
same
reason
if
those
contracts
which
are
in
general
use
be
accompanied
with
any
of
the
requisite
formalities
as
in
a
bargain
or
sale
if
the
price
had
been
agreed
upon
though
no
part
of
the
agreement
had
been
performed
by
either
of
the
parties
the
civil
law
enforced
an
obligation
to
fulfil
them
but
as
it
considers
those
contracts
which
are
seldom
used
more
in
the
light
of
voluntary
engagements
depending
upon
the
good
faith
of
the
respective
parties
than
upon
legal
obligation
it
leaves
both
sides
at
liberty
to
relinquish
them
at
any
time
prior
to
their
being
naturally
performed
distinctions
of
this
kind
are
unknown
to
the
law
of
nature
which
gives
simple
agreements
equal
authority
with
those
that
are
included
by
civilians
in
the
class
of
express
contracts
and
on
the
score
of
antiquity
their
pretensions
are
far
superior
it
is
therefore
perfectly
conformable
to
the
principles
of
nature
to
reduce
the
adjustment
of
all
agreements
without
any
regard
to
the
distinction
between
simple
and
express
contracts
to
the
three
species
already
named
thus
for
instance
one
thing
is
given
for
another
which
constitutes
barter
the
most
ancient
kind
of
traffic
the
next
step
in
the
progress
of
commercial
intercourse
is
where
one
kind
of
money
is
given
for
another
a
transaction
which
by
merchants
is
called
exchange
and
a
third
species
of
contract
is
where
money
is
given
for
any
thing
as
in
the
acts
of
selling
and
buying
or
the
use
of
one
thing
may
be
given
for
that
of
another
money
also
may
be
given
for
the
use
of
a
thing
which
last
method
constitutes
the
acts
of
letting
and
hiring
the
term
use
is
to
be
understood
here
as
applied
not
only
to
the
bare
unproductive
use
of
a
thing
but
to
that
which
is
attended
with
profit
whether
it
be
temporary
personal
hereditary
or
circumscribed
as
was
the
case
among
the
hebrews
with
regard
to
transfers
which
could
be
made
for
no
longer
a
time
than
till
the
year
of
jubilee
the
very
essence
of
a
loan
consists
in
a
return
of
the
same
kind
of
thing
after
a
stated
period
a
return
which
can
take
place
only
in
things
regulated
by
weight
number
or
measure
whether
it
be
in
commodities
or
money
but
the
exchange
of
labour
branches
out
into
various
kinds
of
recompence
or
return
as
for
instance
a
person
gives
his
labour
for
money
which
in
the
daily
transactions
of
life
is
called
hire
or
wages
where
one
undertakes
to
indemnify
another
for
accidental
losses
or
damages
it
is
called
insurance
a
species
of
contract
scarce
known
to
the
ancients
but
now
forming
a
very
important
branch
in
all
mercantile
and
maritime
concerns
iv
acts
of
communication
are
those
where
each
contributes
a
share
to
the
joint
stock
perhaps
on
one
side
money
and
on
the
other
skill
and
labour
may
be
given
but
in
whatever
way
these
concerns
are
regulated
they
come
under
the
denomination
of
partnerships
with
this
class
we
may
rank
the
alliances
of
different
states
in
war
and
of
the
same
description
are
those
naval
associations
of
individuals
so
frequently
formed
in
holland
for
protection
against
pirates
or
other
invaders
which
is
generally
called
an
admiralty
and
to
which
the
greeks
gave
the
name
of
a
joint
fleet
and
vi
now
mixed
actions
are
either
such
in
themselves
or
made
so
by
some
adventitious
circumstance
thus
if
i
knowingly
give
one
person
a
greater
price
for
a
thing
than
i
can
purchase
it
for
of
another
the
excess
of
price
may
be
considered
partly
as
a
gift
and
partly
as
a
purchase
or
if
i
engage
a
goldsmith
to
make
me
any
article
with
his
own
materials
the
price
which
i
give
will
be
partly
a
purchase
and
partly
wages
the
feudal
system
too
might
be
considered
as
a
train
of
mixed
contracts
where
the
grant
of
the
fee
might
be
considered
as
a
beneficial
act
but
the
military
service
required
by
the
lord
in
return
for
his
protection
gave
the
fee
the
nature
of
a
contract
where
a
person
did
one
thing
expecting
for
it
the
performance
of
another
but
if
any
payment
is
attached
to
it
by
way
of
acknowledgement
it
partakes
of
the
nature
of
a
quit
rent
so
money
sent
to
sea
by
way
of
venture
is
something
compounded
of
a
contract
of
a
loan
and
of
an
insurance
vii
all
acts
beneficial
to
others
except
those
that
are
purely
gratuitous
come
under
the
denomination
of
contracts
viii
in
all
contracts
natural
justice
requires
that
there
should
be
an
equality
of
terms
insomuch
that
the
aggrieved
party
has
an
action
against
the
other
for
overreaching
him
this
equality
consists
partly
in
the
performance
and
partly
in
the
profits
of
the
contract
applying
to
all
the
previous
arrangements
and
to
the
essential
consequences
of
the
agreement
ix
as
to
an
equality
of
terms
previous
to
the
contract
it
is
evident
that
a
seller
is
bound
to
discover
to
a
purchaser
any
defects
which
are
known
to
him
in
a
thing
offered
for
sale
a
rule
not
only
established
by
civil
laws
but
strictly
conformable
to
natural
justice
for
the
words
of
agreement
between
contracting
parties
are
even
stronger
than
those
on
which
society
is
founded
and
in
this
manner
may
be
explained
the
observation
of
diogenes
the
babylonian
who
in
discussing
this
topic
said
it
is
not
every
degree
of
silence
which
amounts
to
concealment
nor
is
one
person
bound
to
disclose
every
thing
which
may
be
of
service
to
another
thus
for
instance
a
man
of
science
is
not
strictly
bound
to
communicate
to
another
that
knowledge
which
might
redound
to
his
advantage
for
contracts
which
were
invented
to
promote
a
beneficial
intercourse
among
mankind
require
some
closer
and
more
intimate
connection
than
bare
to
enforce
their
obligation
upon
which
ambrose
has
justly
remarked
that
in
contracts
the
faults
of
things
exposed
to
sale
ought
to
be
made
known
of
which
unless
the
seller
has
given
intimation
though
he
may
have
transferred
the
right
of
property
by
sale
yet
he
is
liable
to
an
action
of
fraud
but
the
same
can
not
be
said
of
things
not
coming
under
the
nature
of
contracts
thus
if
any
one
should
sell
his
corn
at
a
high
price
when
he
knows
that
many
ships
laden
with
grain
are
bound
for
that
place
though
it
would
be
an
act
of
kindness
in
him
to
communicate
such
intelligence
to
the
purchasers
and
though
no
advantage
could
be
derived
to
him
from
withholding
the
communication
but
at
the
expence
of
charity
yet
there
is
nothing
unjust
in
it
or
contrary
to
the
general
rules
of
dealing
the
practice
is
vindicated
by
diogenes
in
the
passage
of
cicero
alluded
to
he
says
i
carried
my
commodities
and
offered
them
to
sale
in
selling
them
i
demanded
no
greater
price
than
others
did
if
the
supply
had
been
greater
i
would
have
sold
them
for
less
and
where
is
the
wrong
done
to
any
one
the
maxim
of
cicero
therefore
can
not
generally
be
admitted
that
knowing
a
thing
yourself
to
wish
another
whose
interest
it
is
to
know
it
also
to
remain
ignorant
of
it
merely
for
the
sake
of
your
own
advantage
amounts
to
a
fraudulent
concealment
by
no
means
for
that
only
is
a
fraudulent
concealment
which
immediately
affects
the
nature
of
the
contract
as
for
instance
in
selling
a
house
to
conceal
the
circumstance
of
its
being
infected
with
the
plague
or
having
been
ordered
by
public
authority
to
be
pulled
down
but
it
is
unnecessary
to
mention
that
the
person
with
whom
a
seller
treats
ought
to
be
apprised
of
every
circumstance
attending
the
thing
offered
for
sale
if
it
be
lands
whether
the
tenure
be
subject
to
a
or
service
of
any
kind
or
be
entirely
free
and
xi
nor
is
the
equality
that
has
been
explained
confined
solely
to
the
communication
of
all
the
circumstances
of
the
case
to
the
contracting
parties
but
it
includes
also
an
entire
freedom
of
consent
in
both
in
the
principal
act
itself
the
proper
equality
requires
that
no
more
should
be
demanded
either
party
than
what
is
just
which
can
scarce
have
a
place
in
gratuitous
acts
to
stipulate
for
a
recompence
in
return
for
a
loan
or
for
the
service
of
labour
or
commission
is
doing
no
wrong
but
constitutes
a
kind
of
mixed
contract
partaking
of
the
nature
of
a
gratuitous
act
and
an
act
of
exchange
and
in
all
acts
of
exchange
this
equality
is
to
be
punctually
observed
nor
can
it
be
said
that
if
one
party
promises
more
it
is
to
be
looked
upon
as
a
gift
for
men
never
enter
into
contracts
with
such
intentions
nor
ought
the
existence
of
such
intentions
ever
be
presumed
unless
they
evidently
appear
for
all
promises
or
gifts
in
these
cases
are
made
with
an
expectation
of
receiving
an
equivalent
in
return
when
the
words
of
in
all
bargains
and
contracts
we
are
anxious
to
receive
more
and
give
less
than
is
due
what
is
this
but
a
species
of
fraud
or
robbery
the
writer
of
the
life
of
isidorus
in
photius
relates
of
hermias
that
when
any
thing
which
he
wished
to
purchase
was
valued
at
too
low
a
rate
he
made
up
the
deficiency
of
the
price
thinking
that
to
act
otherwise
was
a
species
of
injustice
though
it
might
escape
the
observation
of
others
and
in
this
sense
may
be
interpreted
the
law
of
the
hebrews
xii
there
remains
another
degree
of
equality
to
be
considered
arising
out
of
the
following
case
it
may
happen
in
contracts
that
although
nothing
is
concealed
which
ought
to
be
made
known
nor
more
exacted
or
taken
by
one
party
than
is
due
yet
there
may
be
some
inequality
without
any
fault
in
either
of
the
parties
perhaps
for
instance
there
might
be
some
unknown
defect
in
the
thing
or
there
might
be
some
mistake
in
the
price
yet
in
such
cases
to
preserve
that
equality
which
is
an
essential
requisite
in
all
contracts
the
party
suffering
by
such
defect
or
mistake
ought
to
be
indemnified
by
the
other
for
in
all
engagements
it
either
is
or
ought
to
be
a
standing
rule
that
both
parties
should
have
equal
and
just
advantages
it
was
not
in
every
kind
of
equality
that
the
roman
law
established
this
rule
passing
over
slight
occasions
in
order
to
discourage
frequent
and
frivolous
litigation
it
only
interposed
its
judicial
authority
in
weighty
matters
where
the
price
exceeded
the
just
value
by
one
half
laws
indeed
as
cicero
has
said
have
power
to
compel
or
restrain
men
whereas
philosophers
can
only
appeal
to
their
reason
or
understanding
yet
those
who
are
not
subject
to
the
power
of
civil
laws
ought
to
comply
with
whatever
reason
points
out
to
them
to
be
just
so
too
ought
they
who
are
subject
to
the
power
of
human
laws
to
perform
whatever
natural
and
divine
justice
requires
even
in
cases
where
the
laws
neither
give
nor
take
away
the
right
but
only
forbear
to
enforce
it
for
particular
reasons
xiii
there
is
a
certain
degree
of
equality
too
in
beneficial
or
gratuitous
acts
not
indeed
like
that
prevailing
in
contracts
of
exchange
but
proceeding
upon
a
supposition
of
the
hardship
that
any
one
should
receive
detriment
from
voluntary
services
which
he
bestows
for
which
reason
a
voluntary
agent
ought
to
be
indemnified
for
the
expence
or
inconvenience
which
he
incurs
by
undertaking
the
business
of
another
a
borrower
too
is
bound
to
repair
a
thing
that
has
been
damaged
or
destroyed
because
he
is
bound
to
the
owner
not
only
for
the
thing
itself
by
virtue
of
the
property
which
he
retains
in
it
but
he
owes
a
debt
of
gratitude
also
for
the
favour
of
the
loan
unless
it
appears
that
the
thing
so
lent
would
have
perished
had
it
even
remained
in
possession
of
the
owner
himself
in
this
case
the
owner
loses
nothing
by
the
loan
on
the
other
hand
the
depositary
has
received
nothing
but
a
trust
if
the
thing
therefore
is
destroyed
he
can
not
be
bound
to
restore
what
is
no
longer
in
existence
nor
can
he
be
required
to
make
a
recompence
where
he
has
derived
no
advantage
for
in
taking
the
trust
he
did
not
receive
a
favour
but
conferred
one
in
a
pawn
the
same
as
in
a
thing
let
out
for
hire
a
middle
way
of
deciding
the
obligation
may
be
pursued
so
that
the
person
taking
it
is
not
answerable
like
a
borrower
for
every
accident
and
yet
he
is
obliged
to
use
greater
care
than
a
bare
depositary
in
keeping
it
safe
for
though
taking
a
pledge
is
a
gratuitous
acceptance
it
is
followed
by
some
of
the
conditions
of
a
contract
all
these
cases
are
conformable
to
the
roman
law
though
not
originally
derived
from
thence
but
from
natural
equity
rules
all
of
which
may
be
found
among
other
nations
and
among
other
works
we
may
refer
to
the
third
book
and
chapter
of
the
guide
for
doubtful
cases
written
by
moses
maimonides
a
jewish
writer
upon
the
same
principles
the
nature
of
all
other
contracts
may
be
explained
but
the
leading
features
in
those
of
certain
descriptions
seemed
sufficient
for
a
treatise
like
the
present
xiv
the
general
demand
for
any
thing
as
aristotle
has
clearly
proved
constitutes
the
true
measure
of
its
value
which
may
be
seen
particularly
from
the
practice
prevailing
among
barbarous
nations
of
exchanging
one
thing
for
another
but
this
is
not
the
only
standard
for
the
humours
and
caprice
of
mankind
which
dictate
and
controul
all
regulations
give
a
nominal
value
to
many
superfluities
it
was
luxury
says
pliny
that
first
discovered
the
value
of
pearls
and
cicero
has
somewhere
observed
that
the
worth
of
such
things
can
only
be
estimated
by
the
desires
of
men
but
on
the
other
hand
it
happens
that
the
plentiful
supply
of
necessaries
lowers
their
price
this
seneca
in
the
chapter
of
his
sixth
book
on
benefits
proves
by
many
instances
which
he
concludes
with
the
following
observation
the
price
of
every
thing
must
be
regulated
by
the
market
and
notwithstanding
all
your
praises
it
is
worth
nothing
more
than
it
can
be
sold
for
to
which
we
may
add
the
authority
of
paulus
the
lawyer
who
says
the
prices
of
things
do
not
depend
upon
the
humours
and
interest
of
individuals
but
upon
common
estimation
that
is
as
he
explains
himself
elsewhere
according
to
the
worth
which
they
are
of
to
all
hence
it
is
that
things
are
valued
in
proportion
to
what
is
usually
offered
or
given
for
them
a
rule
admitting
of
great
variation
and
latitude
except
in
certain
cases
where
the
law
has
fixed
a
standard
price
in
the
common
price
of
articles
the
labour
and
expence
of
the
merchant
in
procuring
them
is
taken
into
the
account
and
the
sudden
changes
so
frequent
in
all
markets
depend
upon
the
number
of
buyers
whether
it
be
great
or
small
and
upon
the
money
and
marketable
commodities
whether
they
be
plentiful
or
scarce
there
may
indeed
be
casualties
owing
to
which
a
thing
may
be
lawfully
bought
or
sold
above
or
below
the
market
price
thus
for
instance
a
thing
by
being
damaged
may
have
lost
its
original
or
common
value
or
that
which
otherwise
would
not
have
been
disposed
of
may
be
bought
or
sold
from
some
particular
liking
or
aversion
all
these
circumstances
ought
to
be
made
known
to
the
contracting
parties
regard
too
should
be
had
to
the
loss
or
gain
arising
from
delay
or
promptness
of
payment
xv
in
buying
and
selling
we
must
observe
that
the
bargain
is
completed
from
the
very
moment
of
the
contract
even
without
delivery
and
that
is
the
most
simple
way
of
dealing
thus
seneca
says
that
a
sale
is
a
transfer
of
one
right
and
property
in
a
thing
to
another
which
is
done
in
all
exchanges
but
if
it
be
settled
that
the
property
shall
not
be
transferred
immediately
still
the
seller
will
be
bound
to
convey
it
at
the
stated
period
taking
in
the
mean
time
all
the
profits
and
losses
whereas
the
completion
of
bargain
and
sale
by
giving
the
purchaser
a
right
of
possession
and
ejectment
and
conveying
to
him
the
hazard
with
all
the
profits
of
the
property
even
before
it
is
transferred
are
regulations
of
the
civil
law
not
universally
observed
indeed
some
legislators
have
made
the
seller
answerable
for
all
accidents
and
damages
till
the
actual
delivery
of
possession
is
made
as
theophrastus
has
observed
in
a
passage
in
stobaeus
under
the
title
of
laws
where
the
reader
will
find
many
customs
relating
to
the
formalities
of
sale
to
earnest
to
repentance
of
a
bargain
very
different
from
the

dion
prusaeensis
informs
us
that
all
sales
and
contracts
were
confirmed
by
being
entered
in
a
public
register
we
must
observe
too
that
if
a
thing
has
been
twice
sold
of
the
two
sales
the
one
is
valid
where
an
immediate
transfer
of
the
property
has
been
made
either
by
delivery
of
possession
or
in
any
other
mode
for
by
this
means
the
seller
gives
up
an
absolute
right
which
could
not
pass
by
a
promise
alone
xvi
it
is
not
every
kind
of
monopoly
that
amounts
to
a
direct
violation
of
the
laws
of
nature
the
sovereign
power
may
have
very
just
reasons
for
granting
monopolies
and
that
too
at
a
settled
price
a
noble
instance
of
which
we
find
in
the
history
of
joseph
who
governed
egypt
under
the
auspices
of
pharaoh
so
also
under
the
roman
government
the
people
of
alexandria
as
we
are
informed
by
strabo
enjoyed
the
monopoly
of
all
indian
and
ethiopian
goods
a
monopoly
also
may
in
some
cases
be
established
by
individuals
provided
they
sell
at
a
reasonable
rate
but
all
combinations
to
raise
the
necessary
articles
of
life
to
an
exorbitant
rate
or
all
violent
and
fraudulent
attempts
to
prevent
the
market
from
being
supplied
or
to
buy
up
certain
commodities
in
order
to
enhance
the
price
are
public
injuries
and
punishable
as
such
or
indeed
any
way
of
preventing
the
importation
of
goods
or
buying
them
up
in
order
to
sell
them
at
a
greater
rate
than
usual
though
the
price
under
some
particular
circumstances
may
not
seem
unreasonable
is
fully
shewn
by
ambrose
in
his
third
book
of
offices
to
be
a
breach
of
charity
though
it
come
not
directly
under
the
prohibition
of
laws
xvii
as
to
money
it
may
be
observed
that
its
uses
do
not
result
from
any
value
intrinsically
belonging
to
the
precious
metals
or
to
the
specific
denomination
and
shape
of
coin
but
from
the
general
application
which
can
be
made
of
it
as
a
standard
of
payment
for
all
commodities
for
whatever
is
taken
as
a
common
measure
of
all
other
things
ought
to
be
liable
in
itself
to
but
little
variation
now
the
precious
metals
are
of
this
description
possessing
nearly
the
same
intrinsic
value
at
all
times
and
in
all
places
though
the
nominal
value
of
the
same
quantity
of
gold
and
silver
whether
paid
by
weight
or
coin
will
be
greater
or
less
in
proportion
to
the
abundance
or
scarcity
of
the
things
for
which
there
is
a
general
demand
xviii
letting
and
hiring
as
caius
has
justly
said
come
nearest
to
selling
and
buying
and
are
regulated
by
the
same
principles
for
the
price
corresponds
to
the
rent
or
hire
and
the
property
of
a
thing
to
the
liberty
of
using
it
wherefore
as
an
owner
must
bear
the
loss
of
a
thing
that
perishes
so
a
person
hiring
a
thing
or
renting
a
farm
must
bear
the
loss
of
all
ordinary
accidents
as
for
instance
those
of
barrenness
or
any
other
cause
which
may
diminish
his
profits
nor
will
the
owner
on
that
account
be
the
less
entitled
to
the
stipulated
price
or
rent
because
he
gave
the
other
the
right
of
enjoyment
which
at
that
time
was
worth
so
much
unless
it
was
then
agreed
that
the
value
should
depend
upon
such
contingencies
if
an
owner
when
the
first
tenant
has
been
prevented
from
using
a
thing
shall
have
let
it
to
another
all
the
profits
accruing
from
it
are
due
to
the
first
tenant
for
it
would
not
be
equitable
that
the
owner
should
be
made
richer
by
what
belonged
to
another
xix
the
next
topic
that
comes
under
consideration
is
the
lawfulness
of
taking
interest
for
the
use
of
a
consumable
thing
the
arguments
brought
against
which
appear
by
no
means
such
as
to
command
our
assent
for
as
to
what
is
said
of
the
loan
of
consumable
property
being
a
gratuitous
act
and
entitled
to
no
return
the
same
reasoning
may
apply
to
the
letting
of
inconsumable
property
for
hire
requiring
a
recompence
for
the
use
of
which
is
never
deemed
unlawful
though
it
gives
the
contract
itself
a
different
denomination
nor
is
there
any
more
weight
in
the
objection
to
taking
interest
for
the
use
of
money
which
in
its
own
nature
is
barren
and
unproductive
for
the
same
may
be
said
of
houses
and
other
things
which
are
unproductive
and
unprofitable
without
the
industry
of
man
there
is
something
more
specious
in
the
argument
which
maintains
that
as
one
thing
is
here
given
in
return
for
another
and
the
use
and
profits
of
a
thing
can
not
be
distinguished
from
the
thing
itself
when
the
very
use
of
it
depends
upon
its
consumption
nothing
more
ought
to
be
required
in
return
for
the
use
than
what
is
barely
equivalent
to
the
thing
itself
but
it
is
necessary
to
remark
that
when
it
is
said
the
enjoyment
of
the
profits
of
consumable
things
whose
property
is
transferred
in
the
use
to
the
borrower
or
trustee
was
introduced
by
an
act
of
the
senate
this
does
not
properly
come
under
the
notion
of
usufruct
which
certainly
in
its
original
signification
answers
to
no
such
right
yet
it
does
not
follow
that
such
a
right
is
of
no
value
but
on
the
contrary
money
may
be
required
for
surrendering
it
to
the
proprietor
thus
also
the
right
of
not
paying
money
or
wine
borrowed
till
after
a
certain
time
is
a
thing
whose
value
may
be
ascertained
the
delay
being
considered
as
some
advantage
therefore
in
a
mortgage
the
profits
of
the
land
answer
the
use
of
money
but
what
cato
cicero
plutarch
and
others
allege
against
usury
applies
not
so
much
to
the
nature
of
the
thing
as
to
the
accidental
circumstances
and
consequences
with
which
it
is
commonly
attended
xx
there
are
some
kinds
of
interest
which
are
thought
to
wear
the
appearance
of
usury
and
generally
come
under
that
denomination
but
which
in
reality
are
contracts
of
a
different
nature
the
five
shillings
commission
which
a
banker
for
instance
charges
upon
every
hundred
pounds
is
not
so
much
an
interest
in
addition
to
five
per
cent
as
a
compensation
for
his
trouble
and
for
the
risk
and
inconvenience
he
incurs
by
the
loan
of
his
money
which
he
might
have
employed
in
some
other
lucrative
way
in
the
same
manner
a
person
who
lends
money
to
many
individuals
and
for
that
purpose
keeps
certain
sums
of
cash
in
his
hands
ought
to
have
some
indemnity
for
the
continual
loss
of
interest
upon
those
sums
which
may
be
considered
as
so
much
dead
stock
nor
can
any
recompence
of
this
kind
be
branded
with
the
name
of
usury
demosthenes
in
his
speech
against
pantaenetus
condemns
it
as
an
odious
act
of
injustice
to
charge
with
usury
a
man
who
in
order
to
keep
his
principal
undiminished
or
to
assist
another
with
money
lends
out
the
savings
of
his
industry
and
frugal
habits
upon
a
moderate
interest
xxi
those
human
laws
which
allow
a
compensation
to
be
made
for
the
use
of
money
or
any
other
thing
are
neither
repugnant
to
natural
nor
revealed
law
thus
in
holland
where
the
rate
of
interest
upon
common
loans
was
eight
per
cent
there
was
no
injustice
in
requiring
twelve
per
cent
of
merchants
because
the
hazard
was
greater
the
justice
and
reasonableness
indeed
of
all
these
regulations
must
be
measured
by
the
hazard
or
inconvenience
of
lending
for
where
the
recompence
exceeds
this
it
becomes
an
act
of
extortion
or
oppression
xxii
contracts
for
guarding
against
danger
which
are
called
insurances
will
be
deemed
fraudulent
and
void
if
the
insurer
knows
beforehand
that
the
thing
insured
is
already
safe
or
has
reached
its
place
of
destination
and
the
other
party
that
it
is
already
destroyed
or
lost
and
that
not
so
much
on
account
of
the
equality
naturally
requisite
in
all
contracts
of
exchange
as
because
the
danger
and
uncertainty
is
the
very
essence
of
such
contract
now
the
premium
upon
all
insurances
must
be
regulated
by
common
estimation
xxiii
in
trading
partnerships
where
money
is
contributed
by
both
parties
if
the
proportions
be
equal
the
profits
and
the
losses
ought
to
be
equal
also
but
if
they
be
unequal
the
profits
and
the
losses
must
bear
the
same
proportion
as
aristotle
has
shewn
at
the
conclusion
of
the
eighth
book
of
his
ethics
and
the
same
rule
will
hold
good
where
equal
or
unequal
proportions
of
labor
are
contributed
labor
may
be
given
as
a
balance
against
money
or
both
labor
and
money
may
be
given
according
to
the
general
maxim
that
one
man
labour
is
an
equivalent
for
another
man
money
but
there
are
various
ways
of
forming
these
agreements
if
a
man
borrows
money
to
employ
his
skill
upon
in
trading
for
himself
whether
he
gains
or
loses
the
whole
he
is
answerable
to
the
owner
for
the
principal
but
where
a
man
unites
his
labor
to
the
capital
of
another
in
partnership
there
he
becomes
a
partner
in
the
principal
to
a
share
of
which
he
is
entitled
in
the
first
of
these
cases
the
principal
is
not
compared
as
a
balance
against
the
labor
but
it
is
lent
upon
terms
proportioned
to
the
risk
of
losing
it
or
the
probable
gains
to
be
derived
from
it
in
the
other
case
the
price
of
labour
is
weighed
as
it
were
against
the
money
and
the
party
who
bestows
it
is
entitled
to
an
equivalent
share
in
the
capital
what
has
been
said
of
labour
may
be
applied
to
voyages
and
all
other
hazardous
undertakings
for
it
is
contrary
to
the
very
nature
of
partnerships
for
any
one
to
share
in
the
gain
and
to
be
exempt
from
the
losses
yet
it
may
be
so
settled
without
any
degree
of
injustice
for
there
may
be
a
mixed
contract
arising
out
of
a
contract
of
insurance
in
which
due
equality
may
be
preserved
by
allowing
the
person
who
has
taken
upon
himself
the
losses
to
receive
a
greater
share
of
the
gain
than
he
would
otherwise
have
done
but
it
is
a
thing
quite
inadmissible
that
any
one
should
be
responsible
for
the
losses
without
partaking
of
the
gains
for
a
communion
of
interests
is
so
natural
to
society
that
it
can
not
subsist
without
it
what
has
been
said
by
writers
on
the
civil
law
that
the
shares
are
understood
to
be
equal
where
they
are
not
expressly
named
is
true
where
equal
quotas
have
been
contributed
but
in
a
general
partnership
the
shares
are
not
to
be
measured
by
what
may
arise
from
this
or
that
article
but
from
the
probable
profits
of
the
whole
xxiv
in
naval
associations
the
common
motive
of
utility
is
against
pirates
though
they
may
sometimes
be
formed
from
less
worthy
motives
in
computing
the
losses
to
be
sustained
by
each
it
is
usual
to
estimate
the
number
of
men
the
number
of
ships
and
the
quantity
of
merchandise
protected
and
what
has
hitherto
been
said
will
be
found
conformable
to
natural
justice
xxv
nor
does
the
voluntary
law
of
nations
appear
to
make
any
alteration
here
however
there
is
one
exception
which
is
that
where
equal
terms
have
been
agreed
upon
if
no
fraud
has
been
used
nor
any
necessary
information
withheld
they
shall
be
considered
as
equal
in
an
external
point
of
view
so
that
no
action
can
be
maintained
in
a
court
for
such
inequality
which
was
the
case
in
the
civil
law
before
dioclesian
constitution
so
among
those
who
are
bound
by
the
law
of
nations
alone
there
can
be
no
redress
or
constraint
on
such
account
and
this
is
the
meaning
of
what
pomponius
says
that
in
a
bargain
and
sale
one
man
may
naturally
overreach
another
an
allowance
which
is
not
to
be
construed
as
a
right
but
is
only
so
far
a
permission
that
no
legal
remedy
can
be
used
against
the
person
who
is
determined
to
insist
upon
the
agreement
in
this
place
as
in
many
others
the
word
natural
signifies
nothing
more
than
what
is
received
by
general
custom
in
this
sense
the
apostle
paul
has
said
that
it
is
naturally
disgraceful
for
a
man
to
wear
long
hair
a
thing
in
which
there
is
nothing
repugnant
to
nature
but
which
is
the
general
practice
among
some
nations
indeed
many
writers
both
sacred
and
profane
give
the
name
of
natural
to
what
is
only
customary
and
habitual
chapter
xiii
on
oaths
efficacy

in

sense

according
to
the
usual
meaning
of

words

to
be

observed

cases
the
controul
of

over

subjects

on
our
saviour
prohibition
of
oaths
forms
substituted
for
oaths
i
the
sanctity
of
an
oath
with
regard
to
promises
agreements
and
contracts
has
always
been
held
in
the
greatest
esteem
in
every
age
and
among
every
people
for
as
sophocles
has
said
in
his
hippodamia
the
soul
is
bound
to
greater
caution
by
the
addition
of
an
oath
for
it
guards
us
against
two
things
most
to
be
avoided
the
reproach
of
friends
and
the
wrath
of
heaven
in
addition
to
which
the
authority
of
cicero
may
be
quoted
who
says
our
forefathers
intended
that
an
oath
should
be
the
best
security
for
sincerity
of
affirmation
and
the
observance
of
good
faith
for
he
observes
in
another
there
can
be
no
stronger
tie
to
the
fulfilment
of
our
word
and
promise
than
an
oath
which
is
a
solemn
appeal
to
the
testimony
of
god
ii
the
next
point
to
be
considered
is
the
original
force
and
extent
of
oaths
and
in
the
first
place
the
arguments
that
have
been
used
respecting
promises
and
contracts
apply
to
oaths
also
which
ought
never
to
be
taken
but
with
the
most
deliberate
reflection
and
judgment
nor
can
any
one
lawfully
take
an
oath
with
a
secret
intention
of
not
being
bound
by
it
for
the
obligation
is
an
inseparable
and
necessary
consequence
of
an
oath
and
every
act
accompanied
with
an
obligation
is
supposed
to
proceed
from
a
deliberate
purpose
of
mind
every
one
is
bound
likewise
to
adhere
to
an
oath
in
that
sense
in
which
it
is
usually
understood
to
be
taken
for
an
oath
being
an
appeal
to
god
should
declare
the
full
truth
in
the
sense
in
which
it
is
understood
and
this
is
the
sense
upon
which
cicero
insists
that
all
oaths
should
be
performed
and
adhered
to
in
that
sense
in
which
the
party
imposing
them
intended
they
should
be
taken
for
although
in
other
kinds
of
promises
a
condition
may
easily
be
implied
to
release
the
promiser
yet
that
is
a
latitude
by
no
means
admissible
in
an
oath
and
on
this
point
an
appeal
may
be
made
to
that
passage
where
the
admirable
writer
of
the
epistle
to
the
hebrews
has
said
god
willing
more
abundantly
to
shew
unto
the
heirs
of
the
promise
the
immutability
of
his
counsel
confirmed
it
by
an
oath
that
by
two
immutable
things
in
which
it
was
impossible
for
god
to
deceive
we
might
have
a
strong
consolation
in
order
to
understand
these
words
we
must
observe
that
the
sacred
writers
in
speaking
of
god
often
attribute
to
him
human
passions
rather
in
conformity
to
our
finite
capacities
than
to
his
infinite
nature
for
god
does
not
actually
change
his
decrees
though
he
may
be
said
to
do
so
and
to
repent
whenever
he
acts
otherwise
than
the
words
seemed
to
indicate
the
occasion
on
which
they
were
delivered
having
ceased
now
this
may
easily
be
applied
in
the
case
of
threats
as
conferring
no
right
sometimes
too
in
promises
where
a
condition
is
implied
the
apostle
therefore
names
two
things
denoting
immutability
a
promise
which
confers
a
right
and
an
oath
which
admits
of
no
mental
reservations
from
the
above
arguments
it
is
easy
to
comprehend
what
is
to
be
thought
of
an
oath
fraudulently
obtained
for
if
it
is
certain
that
a
person
took
the
oath
upon
a
supposition
which
afterwards
was
proved
to
have
no
foundation
and
but
for
the
belief
of
which
he
would
never
have
taken
it
he
will
not
be
bound
by
it
but
if
it
appears
that
he
would
have
taken
it
without
that
supposition
he
must
abide
by
his
oath
because
oaths
allow
of
no
evasion
iii
the
meaning
of
an
oath
should
not
be
stretched
beyond
the
usual
acceptation
of
words
therefore
there
was
no
breach
of
their
oath
in
those
who
having
sworn
that
they
would
not
give
their
daughters
in
marriage
to
the
benjamites
permitted
those
that
had
been
carried
off
to
live
with
them
for
there
is
a
difference
between
giving
a
thing
and
not
recovering
that
which
is
lost
iv
to
give
validity
to
an
oath
the
obligation
which
it
imposes
ought
to
be
lawful
therefore
a
sworn
promise
to
commit
an
illegal
act
to
do
any
thing
in
violation
of
natural
or
revealed
law
will
be
of
no
effect
indeed
if
a
thing
promised
upon
oath
be
not
actually
illegal
but
only
an
obstruction
to
some
greater
moral
duty
in
that
case
also
the
oath
will
not
be
valid
because
it
is
a
duty
which
we
owe
to
god
not
to
deprive
ourselves
of
the
freedom
of
doing
all
the
good
in
our
power
vi
oaths
may
differ
in
form
and
yet
agree
in
substance
for
they
all
ought
to
include
an
appeal
to
god
calling
upon
him
to
witness
the
truth
or
to
punish
the
falsehood
of
their
assertions
both
of
which
amount
to
the
same
thing
for
an
appeal
to
the
testimony
of
a
superior
who
has
a
right
to
punish
is
the
same
as
requiring
him
to
avenge
an
act
of
perfidy
now
the
omniscience
of
god
gives
him
power
to
punish
as
well
as
to
witness
every
degree
of
falsehood
vii
it
was
a
custom
with
the
ancients
to
swear
by
persons
or
beings
expressly
distinct
from
the
supreme
creator
either
imprecating
the
wrath
of
those
by
whom
they
swore
whether
it
were
the
sun
the
heavens
or
the
earth
or
swearing
by
their
own
heads
by
their
children
their
country
or
their
prince
and
calling
for
destruction
upon
them
if
there
were
any
falsehood
in
their
oaths
nor
was
this
practice
confined
to
heathen
nations
only
but
as
we
are
informed
by
philo
it
prevailed
among
the
jews
for
he
says
that
we
ought
not
in
taking
an
oath
upon
every
occasion
to
have
recourse
to
the
maker
and
father
of
the
universe
but
to
swear
by
our
parents
by
the
heavens
the
earth
the
universe
thus
joseph
is
said
to
have
sworn
by
the
life
of
pharaoh
according
to
the
received
custom
of
the
egyptians
nor
does
our
saviour
in
the
fifth
chapter
of
gospel
intend
as
it
is
supposed
by
some
to
consider
these
oaths
to
be
less
binding
than
those
taken
expressly
by
the
name
of
god
but
as
the
jews
were
too
much
inclined
to
make
use
of
and
yet
disregard
them
he
shews
them
that
they
are
real
oaths
for
as
ulpian
has
well
observed
he
who
swears
by
his
own
life
seems
to
swear
by
god
bearing
a
respect
and
reference
to
his
divine
power
in
the
same
manner
christ
shews
that
he
who
swears
by
the
temple
swears
by
god
who
presides
in
the
temple
and
that
he
who
swears
by
heaven
swears
by
god
who
sits
upon
the
heavens
but
the
jewish
teachers
of
that
day
thought
that
men
were
not
bound
by
oaths
made
in
the
name
of
created
beings
unless
some
penalty
were
annexed
as
if
the
thing
by
which
they
swore
were
consecrated
to
god
for
this
is
the
kind
of
oath
implied
in
the
word
κορβᾶν
korban
as
by
a
gift
and
it
is
this
error
of
theirs
which
christ
refutes
viii
the
principal
effect
of
oaths
is
to
cut
short
disputes
an
oath
for
confirmation
the
inspired
writer
of
the
epistle
to
the
hebrews
has
is
the
end
of
all
strife
so
too
we
find
in
diodorus
siculus
that
an
oath
was
regarded
among
the
egyptians
as
the
surest
pledge
of
sincerity
that
men
could
give
so
that
every
one
in
taking
an
oath
should
express
the
real
purpose
of
his
mind
and
render
his
actions
conformable
to
those
expressions
there
is
a
beautiful
passage
on
this
subject
in
dionysius
of
halicarnassus
who
says
the
last
pledge
among
men
whether
greeks
or
barbarians
and
it
is
a
pledge
which
no
time
can
blot
out
is
that
which
takes
the
gods
as
witnesses
to
oaths
and
covenants
ix
the
substance
of
an
oath
too
should
be
such
and
conceived
in
such
words
as
to
include
not
only
the
divine
but
the
human
obligations
which
it
implies
for
it
should
convey
to
the
person
who
receives
it
the
same
security
for
his
right
as
he
would
derive
from
an
express
promise
or
a
contract
but
if
either
the
words
bear
no
reference
to
a
person
so
as
to
confer
upon
him
a
right
or
if
they
do
refer
to
him
but
in
such
a
manner
that
some
opposition
may
be
made
to
his
claim
the
force
of
the
oath
will
in
that
case
be
such
as
to
give
that
person
no
right
from
it
yet
he
who
has
taken
it
must
still
submit
to
the
divine
obligation
which
the
oath
imposes
an
example
of
which
we
have
in
a
person
from
whom
a
sworn
promise
has
been
extorted
by
fear
for
here
the
oath
conveys
no
right
but
what
the
receiver
ought
to
relinquish
for
it
has
been
obtained
to
the
prejudice
of
the
giver
thus
we
find
the
hebrew
kings
were
reproved
by
the
prophets
and
punished
by
god
for
not
observing
the
oaths
which
they
had
taken
to
the
kings
of
babylon
x
the
same
rule
applies
not
only
to
transactions
between
public
enemies
but
to
those
between
any
individuals
whatsoever
for
he
to
whom
the
oath
is
taken
is
not
the
only
person
to
be
considered
but
a
solemn
regard
must
be
paid
to
god
in
whose
name
the
oath
is
taken
and
who
possesses
authority
to
enforce
the
obligation
for
which
reason
it
is
impossible
to
admit
the
position
of
cicero
that
it
is
no
breach
of
an
oath
to
refuse
paying
to
robbers
the
sum
stipulated
for
having
spared
one
life
because
such
men
are
not
to
be
ranked
in
the
number
of
lawful
enemies
but
treated
as
the
common
enemies
of
all
mankind
so
that
towards
them
no
faith
ought
to
be
kept
nor
even
the
sanctity
of
an
oath
observed
xi
the
power
of
superiors
over
inferiors
that
is
of
sovereigns
over
subjects
with
respect
to
oaths
is
the
next
topic
that
comes
under
consideration
now
the
act
of
a
superior
can
not
annul
the
perfect
obligation
of
an
oath
which
rests
upon
natural
and
revealed
law
but
as
we
are
not
in
a
state
of
civil
society
entirely
masters
of
our
own
actions
which
in
some
measure
depend
upon
the
direction
of
the
sovereign
power
which
has
a
twofold
influence
with
respect
to
oaths
in
the
one
case
applying
to
the
person
who
takes
and
in
the
other
to
the
person
who
receives
them
this
authority
may
be
exercised
over
the
person
taking
the
oath
either
by
declaring
before
it
is
taken
that
it
shall
be
made
void
or
by
prohibiting
its
fulfilment
when
taken
for
the
inferior
or
subject
considered
as
such
could
not
bind
himself
to
engagements
beyond
those
allowed
by
the
sovereign
legislature
in
the
same
manner
by
the
hebrew
law
husbands
might
annul
the
oaths
of
wives
and
fathers
those
of
children
who
were
still
dependent
xii
in
this
place
we
may
cursorily
observe
that
what
is
said
in
the
precepts
of
christ
and
by
james
against
swearing
at
all
applies
not
to
an
oath
of
affirmation
many
instances
of
which
are
to
be
found
in
the
writings
of
paul
but
to
promissory
oaths
respecting
uncertain
and
future
events
this
is
plain
from
the
opposition
in
the
words
of
christ
you
have
heard
it
hath
been
said
by
them
of
old
time
thou
shalt
not
forswear
thyself
but
shalt
perform
unto
the
lord
thine
oath
but
i
say
to
you
swear
not
at
all
and
the
reason
given
for
it
by
james
is
that
you
fall
not
into
hypocrisy
or
be
found
deceivers
for
so
the
word
hypocrisy
signifies
in
the
greek
again
it
is
said
by
paul
that
all
the
promises
of
god
in
christ
are
yea
and
amen
that
is
are
certain
and
undoubted
hence
came
the
hebrew
phrase
that
a
just
man
yea
is
yea
and
his
no
is
no
on
the
other
hand
persons
whose
actions
differ
from
their
affirmations
are
said
to
speak
yea
and
no
that
is
their
affirmation
is
a
denial
and
their
denial
an
affirmation
in
this
manner
paul
vindicates
himself
from
the
charge
of
lightness
of
speech
adding
that
his
conversation
had
not
been
yea
and
no
xiii
affirmations
are
not
the
only
modes
of
obligation
for
in
many
places
signs
have
been
used
as
pledges
of
faith
thus
among
the
persians
giving
the
right
hand
was
considered
the
firmest
tie
so
that
where
any
form
is
substituted
for
an
oath
the
violation
of
it
will
be
an
act
of
perjury
it
has
been
said
of
kings
and
princes
in
particular
that
their
faith
is
the
same
as
an
oath
on
which
account
cicero
in
his
speech
for
dejotarus
commends
caesar
no
less
for
the
vigour
of
his
arm
in
battle
than
for
the
sure
fulfilment
of
the
pledge
and
promise
of
his
right
hand

luctatius
considered
ulpian
has
divided
conventions
into
two
kinds
public
and
private
and
he
has
not
explained
a
public
convention
upon
the
usual
principles
but
has
confined
it
to
a
treaty
of
peace
which
he
alleges
as
his
first
example
and
he
has
made
use
of
the
engagements
entered
into
by
the
generals
of
two
contending
powers
as
an
instance
of
private
conventions
by
public
conventions
therefore
he
means
those
which
can
not
be
made
but
by
the
authority
and
in
the
name
of
the
sovereign
power
thus
distinguishing
them
not
only
from
the
private
contracts
of
individuals
but
also
from
the
personal
contracts
of
sovereigns
themselves
and
indeed
private
injuries
and
contracts
no
less
than
public
treaties
frequently
prove
the
origin
of
wars
and
as
private
contracts
have
been
already
so
amply
discussed
the
higher
order
of
contracts
which
come
under
the
denomination
of
treaties
will
necessarily
form
the
leading
part
in
our
farther
inquiries
ii
and
iii
now
public
conventions
may
be
divided
into
treaties
engagements
and
other
compacts
the
ninth
book
of
livy
may
be
consulted
on
the
distinction
between
treaties
and
engagements
where
the
historian
informs
us
that
treaties
are
those
contracts
which
are
made
by
the
express
authority
of
the
sovereign
power
and
in
which
the
people
invoke
the
divine
vengeance
on
their
heads
if
they
violate
their
engagements
among
the
romans
the
persons
employed
in
declaring
war
and
making
peace
were
in
the
conclusion
of
these
solemn
treaties
always
accompanied
by
the
principal
herald
who
took
the
oath
in
the
name
of
the
whole
people
a
or
engagement
is
what
was
made
by
persons
who
had
no
express
commission
for
that
purpose
from
the
sovereign
power
and
whose
acts
consequently
required
a
further
ratification
from
the
sovereign
himself
the
senate
of
rome
we
are
informed
by
sallust
judged
very
properly
in
passing
a
decree
that
no
treaty
could
be
made
without
their
consent
and
that
of
the
people
livy
relates
that
hieronymus
king
of
syracuse
having
entered
into
a
convention
with
hannibal
sent
afterwards
to
carthage
to
have
it
converted
by
the
state
into
a
league
for
which
reason
seneca
the
elder
has
said
applying
the
expression
to
persons
invested
with
a
special
commission
for
that
purpose
that
a
treaty
negotiated
by
the
general
binds
the
whole
of
the
roman
people
who
are
supposed
to
have
made
it
but
in
monarchies
the
power
of
making
treaties
belongs
to
the
king
alone
a
maxim
which
the
language
of
poetry
no
less
than
the
records
of
history
shews
to
have
been
held
in
all
ages
euripides
whose
sentiments
are
always
conformable
to
nature
and
popular
opinion
in
his
tragedy
of
the
suppliants
says
it
rests
with
adrastus
to
take
the
oath
to
whom
as
sovereign
the
sole
right
of
binding
the
country
by
treaties
belongs
no
subordinate
magistrates
have
such
a
power
of
binding
the
people
nor
will
the
acts
of
a
smaller
portion
bind
the
greater
an
argument
used
in
favour
of
the
romans
against
the
gauls
for
there
was
a
majority
of
the
people
with
camillus
the
dictator
but
it
remains
to
be
considered
how
far
the
acts
of
those
who
have
engaged
for
the
people
without
any
public
authority
are
binding
perhaps
it
may
be
said
that
the
contracting
parties
have
discharged
their
responsibility
when
they
have
done
all
in
their
power
towards
the
fulfilment
of
their
obligation
that
might
be
the
case
in
promises
but
the
obligation
in
public
contracts
is
of
a
stricter
kind
for
the
party
contracting
requires
something
in
return
for
the
engagements
he
makes
hence
the
civil
law
which
rejects
all
promises
made
by
one
person
for
the
performance
of
some
act
by
another
renders
him
who
engages
for
the
ratification
of
a
thing
liable
to
pay
damages
and
interest
iv
the
most
accurate
distinction
in
treaties
is
that
which
makes
the
foundation
of
some
rest
purely
upon
the
law
of
nature
and
others
upon
the
obligations
which
men
have
either
derived
from
the
law
of
nature
or
added
to
it
treaties
of
the
former
kind
are
in
general
made
not
only
between
enemies
as
a
termination
of
war
but
in
ancient
times
were
frequently
made
and
in
some
degree
thought
necessary
among
men
in
the
formation
of
every
contract
this
arose
from
that
principle
in
the
law
of
nature
which
established
a
degree
of
kindred
among
mankind
therefore
it
was
unlawful
for
one
man
to
be
injured
by
another
and
this
natural
justice
universally
prevailed
before
the
deluge
but
after
that
event
in
process
of
time
as
evil
dispositions
and
habits
gained
ground
it
was
by
degrees
obliterated
so
that
one
people
robbing
and
plundering
another
even
when
no
war
had
been
commenced
or
declared
was
deemed
lawful
epiphanius
calls
this
the
scythian
fashion
nothing
is
more
frequent
in
the
writings
of
homer
than
for
men
to
be
asked
if
they
are
robbers
a
question
as
thucydides
informs
us
by
no
means
intending
to
convey
reproach
but
purely
for
information
in
an
ancient
law
of
solon
mention
is
made
of
companies
formed
for
robbery
and
we
find
from
justin
that
till
the
times
of
tarquin
piracy
was
attended
with
a
degree
of
glory
in
the
law
of
the
romans
it
was
a
maxim
that
nations
which
had
not
entered
into
terms
of
amity
or
into
treaties
with
them
were
not
to
be
considered
as
enemies
but
if
any
thing
belonging
to
the
romans
fell
into
their
hands
it
became
theirs
or
any
citizen
of
rome
taken
by
them
became
a
slave
and
the
romans
would
treat
any
person
belonging
to
that
nation
in
the
same
manner
in
this
case
the
right
of
postliminium
is
observed
so
at
a
remote
period
before
the
times
of
the
peloponnesian
war
the
corcyraeans
were
not
considered
as
enemies
by
the
athenians
though
there
was
no
treaty
of
peace
subsisting
between
them
as
appears
from
the
speech
of
the
corinthians
given
by
thucydides
aristotle
commends
the
practice
of
plundering
barbarians
and
in
ancient
latium
an
enemy
signified
nothing
but
a
foreigner
in
the
class
of
treaties
referred
to
in
this
section
may
be
ranked
those
made
between
different
states
for
the
mutual
preservation
of
the
rights
of
hospitality
and
commerce
as
far
as
they
come
under
the
law
of
nature
arco
makes
use
of
this
distinction
in
his
speech
to
the
achaeans
as
reported
by
livy
where
he
says
he
does
not
require
an
offensive
and
defensive
alliance
but
only
such
a
treaty
as
may
secure
their
rights
from
infringement
by
each
other
or
prevent
them
from
harbouring
the
fugitive
slaves
of
the
macedonians
conventions
of
this
kind
were
called
by
the
greeks
strictly
speaking
peace
in
opposition
to
treaties
treaties
founded
upon
obligations
added
to
those
of
the
law
of
nature
are
either
equal
or
unequal
equal
treaties
are
those
by
which
equal
advantages
are
secured
on
both
sides
the
greeks
call
them
alliances
and
sometimes
alliances
upon
an
equal
scale
but
treaties
of
the
latter
kind
are
more
properly
leagues
than
treaties
and
where
one
of
the
parties
is
inferior
in
dignity
they
are
called
injunctions
or
injunctions
annexed
to
covenants
demosthenes
in
his
speech
on
the
liberty
of
the
rhodians
says
all
nations
ought
to
guard
against
forming
such
leagues
as
approaching
too
near
to
servitude
treaties
of
both
kinds
whether
of
peace
or
alliance
are
made
from
motives
of
some
advantage
to
the
parties
by
equal
treaties
of
peace
the
restoration
of
prisoners
the
restoration
or
cession
of
conquered
places
and
other
matters
providing
for
its
due
maintenance
are
settled
a
subject
that
will
be
more
fully
treated
of
hereafter
in
stating
the
effects
and
consequences
of
war
treaties
of
alliance
upon
equal
conditions
relate
either
to
commerce
or
to
contributions
for
the
joint
prosecution
of
a
war
or
to
other
objects
of
equal
importance
equal
treaties
of
commerce
may
vary
in
their
terms
for
instance
it
may
be
settled
that
no
duties
shall
be
imposed
upon
the
goods
of
the
subjects
belonging
to
each
of
the
contracting
powers
or
that
the
duties
upon
their
respective
commodities
shall
be
lower
than
the
duties
upon
those
of
any
other
nation
the
first
of
these
examples
may
be
found
in
an
ancient
treaty
between
the
romans
and
carthaginians
in
which
there
is
a
clause
making
an
exception
of
what
is
given
to
the
notary
and
public
crier
or
it
may
be
settled
that
no
higher
duties
than
those
existing
at
the
time
the
treaty
is
made
shall
be
imposed
or
that
they
shall
not
be
augmented
beyond
a
certain
rate
so
in
alliances
of
war
the
contracting
parties
are
required
to
furnish
equal
numbers
of
troops
or
ships
a
kind
of
alliance
which
as
thucydides
explains
it
calls
upon
the
united
powers
to
hold
the
same
states
for
common
enemies
or
friends
we
find
in
many
parts
of
livy
alliances
of
this
description
among
states
for
the
mutual
defence
of
their
territories
or
for
the
prosecution
of
some
particular
war
or
against
some
particular
enemy
or
against
all
states
excepting
their
respective
allies
polybius
has
given
a
treaty
of
this
kind
made
between
the
carthaginians
and
macedonians
in
the
same
manner
the
rhodians
bound
themselves
by
treaty
to
assist
atigonus
demetrius
against
all
enemies
except
ptolemy
there
are
other
objects
too
for
which
equal
treaties
are
made
thus
one
power
may
bind
another
to
build
no
forts
in
their
neighbourhood
which
might
prove
an
annoyance
to
give
no
encouragement
to
rebellious
subjects
to
allow
the
troops
of
an
enemy
no
passage
through
their
country
vi
from
equal
treaties
the
nature
of
unequal
treaties
may
easily
be
understood
and
where
two
powers
contract
this
inequality
may
be
on
the
side
either
of
the
superior
or
of
the
inferior
power
a
superior
power
may
be
said
to
make
an
unequal
treaty
when
it
promises
assistance
without
stipulating
for
any
return
or
gives
greater
advantages
than
it
engages
to
receive
and
on
the
part
of
the
inferior
power
this
inequality
subsists
when
as
isocrates
says
in
his
panegyric
her
privileges
are
unduly
depressed
so
that
engagements
of
this
kind
may
be
called
injunctions
or
commands
rather
than
treaties
and
these
may
or
may
not
be
attended
with
a
diminution
of
their
sovereign
power
such
a
diminution
of
sovereign
power
followed
the
second
treaty
between
the
carthaginians
and
romans
by
which
the
former
were
bound
to
make
no
war
but
with
the
consent
of
the
roman
people
so
that
from
that
time
appian
says
the
carthaginians
were
compelled
by
treaty
to
comply
with
the
humour
of
the
romans
to
this
kind
may
be
added
a
conditional
surrender
except
that
it
leads
not
to
a
diminution
but
to
an
entire
transfer
of
the
sovereign
dignity
and
power
vii
the
burdens
attached
to
unequal
treaties
where
no
diminution
of
sovereignty
takes
place
may
be
either
transitory
or
permanent
transitory
burdens
are
those
by
which
the
payment
of
certain
sums
of
money
is
imposed
the
demolition
of
certain
works
and
fortifications
the
cession
of
certain
countries
and
the
delivery
of
ships
or
hostages
are
required
but
permanent
conditions
are
those
which
require
the
tribute
of
homage
and
submission
from
one
power
to
another
nearly
approaching
to
such
treaties
are
those
by
which
one
power
is
debarred
from
having
any
friends
or
enemies
but
at
the
pleasure
of
another
or
from
allowing
a
passage
and
supplies
to
the
troops
of
any
state
with
whom
that
power
may
be
at
war
besides
these
there
may
be
conditions
of
an
inferior
and
less
important
kind
such
as
those
which
prohibit
the
building
of
forts
in
certain
places
maintaining
armies
or
having
ships
beyond
a
certain
number
navigating
certain
seas
or
raising
troops
in
certain
countries
attacking
allies
or
supplying
enemies
some
conditions
indeed
go
so
far
as
to
prohibit
a
state
from
admitting
refugees
and
to
demand
annulling
all
former
engagements
with
every
other
power
numerous
examples
of
such
treaties
are
to
be
found
in
historians
both
ancient
and
modern
unequal
treaties
may
be
made
not
only
between
the
conquerors
and
the
conquered
but
also
between
mighty
and
impotent
states
between
whom
no
hostilities
have
ever
existed
viii
in
considering
treaties
it
is
frequently
asked
whether
it
be
lawful
to
make
them
with
nations
who
are
strangers
to
the
christian
religion
a
question
which
according
to
the
law
of
nature
admits
not
of
a
doubt
for
the
rights
which
it
establishes
are
common
to
all
men
without
distinction
of
religion
the
gospel
has
made
no
change
in
this
respect
but
rather
favours
treaties
by
which
assistance
in
a
just
cause
may
be
afforded
even
to
those
who
are
strangers
to
religion
for
to
embrace
opportunities
of
doing
good
to
all
men
is
not
only
permitted
as
laudable
but
enjoined
as
a
precept
for
in
imitation
of
god
who
makes
his
sun
to
rise
upon
the
righteous
and
the
wicked
and
refreshes
them
both
with
his
gracious
rain
we
are
commanded
to
exclude
no
race
of
men
from
their
due
share
of
our
services
yet
in
equal
cases
it
admits
of
no
doubt
that
those
within
the
pale
of
our
own
religious
communion
have
a
preferable
claim
to
our
support
ix
in
addition
to
the
foregoing
arguments
we
may
observe
that
as
all
christians
are
considered
as
members
of
one
body
which
are
required
to
feel
for
the
pains
and
sufferings
of
each
other
this
precept
applies
not
only
to
individuals
but
to
nations
and
kings
in
their
public
capacity
for
the
rule
of
duty
is
not
to
be
measured
by
the
inclination
of
individuals
but
by
the
injunctions
of
christ
and
in
some
cases
the
ravages
of
an
impious
enemy
can
only
be
opposed
by
a
firm
alliance
among
christian
kings
and
governments
and
it
is
a
duty
from
which
nothing
but
inevitable
necessity
and
their
immediate
attention
being
engrossed
by
the
prosecution
of
other
wars
can
excuse
them
x
another
question
frequently
arises
which
is
when
two
states
are
engaged
in
war
with
each
other
to
which
of
them
a
power
equally
allied
to
both
ought
in
preference
to
give
assistance
here
too
we
must
observe
there
can
be
no
obligation
to
support
unjust
wars
on
which
account
that
confederate
power
which
has
justice
on
its
side
will
have
a
claim
to
preference
if
engaged
in
war
with
another
not
comprehended
in
the
number
of
confederates
or
even
if
engaged
with
one
of
the
confederates
themselves
but
if
two
powers
engage
in
a
war
equally
unjust
on
both
sides
a
third
power
united
in
confederacy
with
both
will
prudently
abstain
from
interference
again
if
two
powers
allied
to
us
are
engaged
in
a
just
war
against
others
with
whom
we
have
no
connection
in
the
supplies
of
men
or
money
that
we
furnish
to
either
we
ought
to
follow
the
rule
observed
in
the
case
of
personal
creditors
but
if
personal
assistance
which
can
not
be
divided
is
required
of
the
contracting
party
in
that
case
the
preference
must
be
given
to
the
engagements
of
the
longest
standing
however
the
case
of
a
subsequent
treaty
which
makes
the
engagements
of
a
more
binding
and
extensive
nature
will
form
an
exception
to
this
rule
xi
the
tacit
renewal
of
a
treaty
ought
not
to
be
presumed
upon
at
the
expiration
of
the
period
limited
for
its
continuance
unless
certain
acts
be
performed
which
can
expressly
be
construed
as
a
renewal
of
it
and
can
be
taken
in
no
other
sense
xii
if
one
of
the
parties
violates
a
treaty
such
a
violation
releases
the
other
from
its
engagements
for
every
clause
has
the
binding
force
of
a
condition
and
as
an
example
of
this
a
passage
from
thucydides
may
be
quoted
where
that
historian
says
that
for
one
power
to
accede
to
a
new
confederacy
and
to
desert
an
ally
who
has
neglected
to
fulfil
his
engagements
is
no
breach
of
a
treaty
but
not
to
assist
another
power
in
conformity
to
sworn
engagements
amounts
to
a
violation
thereof
and
this
is
generally
true
except
where
it
has
been
agreed
to
the
contrary
that
a
treaty
shall
not
be
null
and
relinquished
for
trifling
disgusts
and
miscarriages
xiii
conventions
are
as
various
and
numerous
as
treaties
and
the
distinction
made
between
them
is
owing
more
to
the
difference
of
power
in
those
by
whom
they
are
made
than
to
any
real
difference
in
their
own
nature
but
there
are
two
particular
points
of
inquiry
materially
connected
with
all
conventions
the
first
of
which
relates
to
the
extent
of
the
negotiator
obligation
when
the
sovereign
or
the
state
refuses
to
ratify
a
convention
whether
he
is
bound
to
make
an
indemnity
to
the
other
party
for
the
disappointment
to
restore
things
to
the
situation
they
were
in
before
he
treated
or
to
deliver
up
his
own
person
the
first
opinion
seems
conformable
to
the
roman
civil
law
the
second
to
equity
as
it
was
urged
by
the
tribunes
of
the
people
livius
and
melius
in
the
dispute
about
the
peace
of
caudium
but
the
third
is
that
most
generally
adopted
as
was
done
respecting
the
two
famous
conventions
of
caudium
and
numantia
but
there
is
one
caution
particularly
to
be
observed
and
that
is
that
the
sovereign
is
no
way
bound
by
such
unauthorised
conventions
until
he
has
ratified
them
in
the
convention
alluded
to
if
the
samnites
had
intended
to
bind
the
roman
people
they
should
have
retained
the
army
at
caudium
and
sent
ambassadors
to
the
senate
and
people
at
rome
to
discuss
the
treaty
and
learn
upon
what
terms
they
chose
to
redeem
their
army
xiv
another
question
is
whether
the
knowledge
and
silence
of
the
sovereign
bind
him
to
the
observance
of
a
convention
but
here
it
is
necessary
to
make
a
distinction
between
an
absolute
convention
and
one
made
upon
condition
of
its
being
ratified
by
the
sovereign
for
as
all
conditions
ought
to
be
literally
fulfilled
such
a
condition
on
failure
of
fulfilment
becomes
void
this
principle
was
very
properly
observed
in
the
convention
made
between
luctatius
and
the
carthaginians
to
which
the
people
refused
to
accede
as
it
had
been
made
without
their
consent
a
new
treaty
therefore
was
made
by
public
authority
the
next
thing
to
be
considered
is
whether
there
may
not
be
some
act
of
consent
besides
silence
for
without
some
visible
act
silence
is
not
of
itself
sufficient
to
warrant
a
probable
conjecture
of
intention
but
if
certain
acts
are
done
which
can
be
accounted
for
upon
no
other
grounds
than
those
of
consent
they
are
supposed
to
ratify
a
treaty
thus
if
the
convention
of
luctatius
had
contained
many
clauses
some
of
them
relinquishing
certain
rights
and
those
clauses
had
been
always
duly
observed
by
the
romans
such
observance
would
be
justly
taken
for
a
ratification
of
the
treaty

maintains
that
the
laws
enacted
on
this
subject
are
the
common
laws
of
all
mankind
not
only
greeks
but
barbarians
also
it
is
for
this
very
reason
that
specific
forms
have
been
assigned
for
treaties
which
are
to
be
drawn
up
in
terms
of
unequivocal
and
certain
meaning
the
proper
rule
of
interpretation
is
to
gather
the
intention
of
the
parties
pledged
from
the
most
probable
signs
and
these
are
of
two
kinds
namely
words
and
conjectures
which
may
be
considered
either
separately
or
together
ii
where
we
have
no
other
conjecture
to
guide
us
words
are
not
to
be
strictly
taken
in
their
original
or
grammatical
sense
but
in
their
common
acceptation
for
it
is
the
arbitrary
will
of
custom
which
directs
the
laws
and
rules
of
speech
it
was
a
foolish
act
of
perfidy
therefore
in
the
locrians
when
they
promised
they
would
adhere
to
their
engagements
as
long
as
they
stood
upon
that
soil
and
bore
those
heads
upon
their
shoulders
in
order
to
evade
their
promise
to
cast
away
the
mould
which
they
had
previously
put
within
their
shoes
and
the
heads
of

which
they
had
laid
upon

acts
of

like
these

iii
in

of

which
are
above
the
comprehension
of
the
general
bulk
of
mankind
recourse
for
explanation
must
be
had
to
those
who
are
most
experienced
in
that
art
thus
from
consulting
legal
writers
we
may
conceive
the
nature
of
particular
crimes
or
from
the
pages
of
the
same
authors
derive
our
notions
of
sovereign
power
it
is
a
just
remark
of
cicero
that
the
language
of
logic
is
not
that
of
daily
and
familiar
intercourse
the
writers
of
that
class
have
phrases
peculiar
to
themselves
which
indeed
is
the
case
with
arts
of
every
description
so
in
treaties
where
military
arrangements
occur
an
army
is
defined
to
be
a
number
of
soldiers
capable
of
openly
invading
a
foreign
or
an
enemy
country
for
historians
everywhere
make
a
distinction
between
the
private
incursions
of
robbers
and
what
is
done
by
a
lawful
and
regular
army
what
constitutes
an
army
must
be
therefore
judged
of
by
the
enemy
force
cicero
defines
an
army
to
consist
of
six
legions
and
auxiliaries
polybius
says
that
a
roman
army
in
general
amounted
to
sixteen
thousand
romans
and
twenty
thousand
auxiliaries
but
a
military
force
might
be
composed
of
a
less
number
of
troops
than
this
in
the
same
manner
the
number
of
ships
sufficient
for
any
purpose
will
amount
to
a
fleet
and
a
place
able
to
hold
out
against
an
enemy
may
be
called
a
fort
iv
it
is
necessary
to
make
use
of
conjecture
where
words
or
sentences
admit
of
many
meanings
a
mode
of
expression
when
included
in
one
word
is
called
by
logicians
a
synonymous
term
and
when
extending
to
two
or
more
words
a
doubtful
phrase
in
the
same
manner
it
is
necessary
to
have
recourse
to
conjecture
whenever
a
seeming
contradiction
occurs
in
the
expressions
of
a
treaty
for
in
that
case
we
must
try
to
discover
such
conjectures
as
will
reconcile
if
possible
one
part
with
another
for
if
there
be
an
evident
contradiction
the
contracting
parties
by
their
latter
determinations
must
have
intended
to
abrogate
their
former
as
no
one
can
design
to
make
contradictory
resolutions
at
the
same
time
indeed
all
acts
depending
upon
the
human
will
as
in
the
case
of
laws
and
testaments
which
depend
upon
the
will
of
one
party
and
in
contracts
and
treaties
which
depend
upon
that
of
two
or
more
all
these
acts
are
liable
to
changes
with
a
subsequent
change
of
will
in
the
parties
concerned
in
all
such
cases
any
obscurity
in
the
language
obliges
us
to
have
recourse
to
conjectures
which
are
sometimes
so
obvious
as
to
point
out
a
meaning
directly
contrary
to
that
of
the
words
in
their
usual
acceptation
now
the
principal
sources
of
conjecture
are
to
be
found
in
the
the
consequences
and
the
circumstances
and
connection
from
the
subject
or
matter
as
for
instance
in
the
word
day
thus
if
a
truce
be
made
for
thirty
days
here
civil
and
not
natural
days
are
meant
so
the
word
donation
is
sometimes
used
to
signify
a
transfer
according
to
the
nature
of
the
business
in
the
same
manner
too
the
word
arms
which
in
general
signifies
military
instruments
is
sometimes
applied
to
troops
and
may
be
taken
in
either
sense
according
to
the
particular
occasion
every
interpretation
must
be
given
according
to
the
intention
understood
thus
the
promise
of
a
free
passage
given
upon
the
evacuation
of
a
town
implies
also
that
the
troops
shall
pass
without
molestation
if
a
number
of
ships
are
to
be
given
up
perfect
and
not
mutilated
ships
are
meant
and
in
all
similar
cases
a
similar
judgment
must
be
formed
according
to
the
natural
tenor
of
the
words
vi
another
source
of
interpretation
is
derived
from
the
consequences
especially
where
a
clause
taken
in
its
literal
meaning
would
lead
to
consequences
foreign
or
even
repugnant
to
the
intention
of
a
treaty
for
in
an
ambiguous
meaning
such
an
acceptation
must
be
taken
as
will
avoid
leading
to
an
absurdity
or
contradiction
the
cavil
of
brasidas
therefore
is
highly
abominable
who
promising
that
he
would
evacuate
the
boeotian
territory
said
he
did
not
consider
that
as
boeotian
territory
which
he
occupied
with
his
army
as
if
the
ancient
bounds
were
not
intended
but
only
what
remained
unconquered
an
evasion
which
entirely
annulled
the
treaty
vii
from
the
circumstances
or
context
another
source
of
interpretation
is
derived
no
inconsiderable
light
may
be
thrown
upon
the
meaning
of
an
expression
from
the
circumstance
of
its
being
used
by
the
same
person
to
express
the
same
intentions
on
other
similar
occasions
and
from
its
relation
to
what
goes
before
and
what
follows
the
place
where
it
stands
for
in
all
doubtful
cases
we
have
reason
to
suppose
that
the
contracting
parties
mean
to
be
consistent
with
their
former
opinions
and
intentions
thus
in
homer
in
the
agreement
between
paris
and
menelaus
that
helen
should
be
given
up
to
the
conqueror
when
compared
with
what
follows
it
is
evident
that
by
the
conqueror
is
meant
the
combatant
who
killed
the
other
this
rule
of
interpretation
plutarch
illustrates
by
the
conduct
of
judges
who
passing
by
what
is
obscure
rest
their
decisions
upon
clear
and
unambiguous
points
viii
as
to
the
motives
which
are
sometimes
taken
for
a
rule
of
interpretation
there
may
be
other
substantial
ones
besides
those
immediately
expressed
for
the
passing
of
a
law
or
the
making
of
a
treaty
yet
the
strongest
conjecture
is
that
which
arises
from
certain
proof
that
the
will
was
actuated
by
some
reason
operating
as
a
sole
and
sufficient
motive
for
there
are
frequently
many
motives
and
sometimes
the
will
is
influenced
by
its
own
choice
independent
of
any
other
reason
in
the
same
manner
a
grant
made
in
contemplation
of
a
marriage
will
be
void
if
the
marriage
never
takes
place
ix
it
is
further
to
be
observed
that
many
words
have
a
variety
of
acceptations
some
more
limited
and
others
more
extensive
which
may
be
owing
either
to
the
application
of
a
general
name
to
a
particular
class
of
things
as
in
the
words
kindred
and
adoption
or
to
the
use
of
masculines
to
express
animals
both
of
the
male
and
female
kind
where
nouns
of
a
common
gender
are
wanting
in
terms
of
art
too
words
are
often
taken
in
a
metaphorical
or
extended
sense
thus
in
the
civil
law
death
signifies
banishment
but
in
its
popular
acceptation
a
dissolution
of
the
parts
of
the
natural
body
x
in
promises
likewise
some
things
are
of
a
favourable
some
an
odious
and
others
of
a
mixed
or
indifferent
description
favourable
promises
are
those
which
contain
an
equality
of
terms
or
which
bear
some
relation
to
the
common
good
the
magnitude
and
extent
of
which
increases
the
favour
of
the
promise
so
that
all
engagements
more
conducive
to
peace
than
to
war
are
to
be
considered
as
those
of
a
favourable
complexion
and
alliances
for
mutual
defence
are
always
regarded
as
a
more
laudable
object
than
those
for
offensive
war
treaties
of
an
odious
kind
are
those
which
lay
greater
burdens
on
one
party
than
on
the
other
which
contain
penalties
for
or
which
lead
to
an
abrogation
or
infraction
of
former
treaties
whereas
though
engagements
of
a
mixed
nature
may
create
a
deviation
from
former
treaties
they
may
be
taken
either
in
a
favourable
or
odious
light
according
to
the
magnitude
or
object
of
the
change
produced
if
it
be
for
the
sake
of
peace
it
is
better
taking
all
circumstances
into
consideration
to
rank
them
with
those
of
a
favourable
kind
xi
the
distinction
made
by
the
roman
law
between
acts
of
equity
and
those
of
strict
justice
can
not
generally
be
applied
to
the
law
of
nations
though
it
may
in
some
cases
be
adopted
thus
in
any
transaction
between
the
subjects
of
two
countries
in
each
of
which
the
same
form
of
legal
proceeding
is
observed
the
parties
are
supposed
to
treat
without
any
intention
of
deviating
from
the
common
rule
and
form
unless
they
have
expressly
determined
to
the
contrary
but
in
acts
for
which
no
common
rule
is
prescribed
as
in
donations
and
free
promises
there
the
parties
are
supposed
to
treat
according
to
the
strict
letter
of
the
agreement
xii
after
the
establishment
of
the
former
positions
the
subject
naturally
proceeds
to
the
rules
themselves
which
are
to
be
observed
in
the
interpretation
of
treaties
and
in
the
first
place
we
may
remark
that
in
things
which
are
not
of
an
odious
nature
words
are
to
be
taken
strictly
in
their
popular
meaning
and
where
they
admit
of
exceptions
or
have
more
significations
than
one
it
is
lawful
to
use
that
which
is
most
extensive
as
it
has
been
already
observed
that
both
logicians
and
grammarians
frequently
use
particular
terms
in
a
general
sense
thus
cicero
in
pleading
for
caecina
justly
maintains
that
the
interlocutory
decree
ordering
that
the
person
ejected
from
his
inheritance
should
be
reinstated
in
the
possession
implies
not
only
an
ejectment
but
extends
to
any
forcible
prevention
of
the
owner
taking
possession
in
things
of
a
favourable
nature
if
the
parties
engaged
are
acquainted
with
the
legal
principles
upon
which
they
proceed
or
rest
upon
the
judgment
of
those
who
are
so
the
words
used
may
be
taken
in
their
most
extensive
signification
including
even
terms
of
art
and
of
law
again
we
must
never
have
recourse
to
a
metaphorical
interpretation
except
where
the
literal
meaning
would
lead
to
a
direct
absurdity
or
would
defeat
the
intention
of
a
treaty
on
the
other
hand
a
passage
may
be
interpreted
in
a
more
limited
signification
than
the
words
themselves
bear
if
such
interpretation
be
necessary
to
avoid
injustice
or
absurdity
if
no
such
necessity
exist
but
equity
or
utility
manifestly
require
a
restriction
to
the
literal
meaning
it
must
be
most
rigidly
adhered
to
except
where
circumstances
compel
us
to
do
otherwise
but
in
things
of
an
odious
nature
a
figurative
expression
may
be
allowed
in
order
to
avoid
inconvenience
or
injustice
therefore
when
any
one
makes
a
grant
or
relinquishes
his
right
though
he
express
himself
in
the
most
general
terms
his
words
are
usually
restricted
to
that
meaning
which
it
is
probable
he
intended
and
in
cases
of
this
kind
the
hope
of
retaining
a
thing
is
sometimes
taken
for
the
act
of
possession
in
the
same
manner
it
is
understood
that
subsidies
of
men
promised
by
one
party
only
are
to
be
maintained
at
the
expence
of
the
power
who
requires
them
xiii
it
is
a
famous
question
whether
the
word
allies
includes
only
those
who
were
such
at
the
time
of
making
the
treaty
or
those
who
might
afterwards
become
so
as
was
the
case
in
the
treaty
made
between
the
roman
people
and
the
carthaginians
at
the
conclusion
of
the
war
that
had
originated
in
a
dispute
about
sicily
by
which
treaty
it
was
stipulated
that
both
powers
should
forbear
attacking
the
allies
of
each
other
hence
the
romans
inferred
that
although
the
convention
made
with
asdrubal
by
which
he
was
prohibited
from
passing
the
iberus
had
been
of
no
service
to
them
as
it
had
not
been
ratified
by
the
carthaginians
yet
if
the
carthaginians
sanctioned
the
conduct
of
hannibal
in
his
attack
upon
the
people
of
saguntum
with
whom
the
romans
after
the
making
of
that
convention
had
entered
into
an
alliance
they
should
consider
themselves
as
authorised
to
declare
war
against
the
carthaginians
for
having
violated
a
solemn
treaty
upon
which
livy
reasons
in
the
following
manner
by
the
clause
in
favour
of
allies
on
both
sides
there
was
sufficient
security
for
the
saguntines
for
there
was
no
limitation
of
the
words
to
those
who
were
allies
at
that
time
nor
were
they
such
as
to
exclude
either
power
from
making
new
alliances
but
if
both
sides
were
at
liberty
to
make
new
alliances
who
could
think
it
just
to
deprive
the
new
allies
of
that
protection
to
which
they
would
be
entitled
from
treaties
of
amity
the
exclusion
could
reasonably
go
no
further
than
to
declare
that
the
allies
of
the
carthaginians
should
not
be
seduced
to
renounce
their
engagements
nor
if
they
did
so
be
admitted
into
alliance
with
the
romans
the
last
passage
is
taken
almost
word
for
word
from
the
third
book
of
polybius
on
which
we
may
observe
that
the
word
allies
may
strictly
mean
those
who
were
so
at
the
time
when
the
treaty
was
made
and
without
any
forced
interpretation
may
also
be
extended
to
embrace
those
who
afterwards
became
such
to
which
of
these
interpretations
the
preference
is
to
be
given
may
be
seen
from
the
rules
above
given
and
according
to
those
rules
it
will
be
found
that
alliances
formed
after
the
making
of
the
treaty
will
not
be
comprehended
in
it
because
it
relates
to
the
breach
of
a
treaty
the
violation
of
which
is
an
odious
act
and
tends
to
deprive
the
carthaginians
of
the
liberty
of
redressing
themselves
by
force
against
those
who
were
supposed
to
have
injured
them
a
liberty
sanctioned
by
the
law
of
nature
and
not
to
be
abandoned
on
any
slight
occasion
were
the
romans
debarred
then
by
this
rule
from
making
any
treaty
with
the
saguntines
and
defending
them
after
they
became
allies
no
they
had
a
right
to
defend
them
not
by
virtue
of
any
treaty
but
upon
principles
of
natural
justice
which
no
treaty
can
annul
the
saguntines
therefore
with
respect
to
both
powers
were
in
the
same
situation
as
if
no
engagement
had
been
made
in
favour
of
allies
in
this
case
it
was
no
breach
of
treaty
for
the
carthaginians
upon
just
grounds
to
commence
hostilities
against
the
saguntines
nor
for
the
romans
to
defend
them
upon
the
same
principle
in
the
time
of
pyrrhus
it
had
been
stipulated
by
treaty
between
the
carthaginians
and
romans
that
if
either
of
them
afterwards
entered
into
any
engagement
with
pyrrhus
the
party
so
contracting
should
reserve
to
itself
the
right
of
sending
succours
to
the
other
if
attacked
by
that
king
though
in
that
case
the
war
on
both
sides
could
not
be
just
yet
it
would
involve
no
infraction
of
any
treaty
this
is
an
example
of
a
case
in
equal
treaties
xiv
the
case
of
an
unequal
treaty
may
be
put
where
it
is
agreed
that
one
of
the
confederate
parties
shall
not
make
war
without
the
consent
or
by
the
injunction
of
the
other
which
was
stipulated
in
the
treaty
between
the
romans
and
carthaginians
after
the
conclusion
of
the
second
punic
war
when
the
term
war
is
applied
to
war
of
every
description
particularly
to
offensive
rather
than
defensive
war
in
a
dubious
case
it
must
be
limited
to
its
proper
signification
lest
the
treaty
should
operate
as
too
great
a
restraint
upon
the
liberty
of
that
power
which
has
engaged
in
the
unequal
treaty
xv
of
the
same
kind
is
the
promise
given
by
the
romans
that
carthage
should
be
free
which
could
never
mean
the
enjoyment
of
complete
independence
by
a
people
who
had
long
before
lost
the
right
of
making
war
and
many
of
their
other
privileges
yet
it
left
them
some
degree
of
liberty
so
much
at
least
that
they
should
not
be
obliged
to
remove
the
seat
of
their
government
at
the
command
of
any
foreign
power
and
gave
them
a
pledge
that
their
city
should
not
be
disturbed
it
was
in
vain
then
for
the
romans
to
urge
that
it
was
only
the
city
which
was
intended
whereas
those
acquainted
with
the
use
of
metaphorical
language
know
that
by
the
city
is
frequently
meant
the
inhabitants
and
government
with
its
privileges
and
not
the
mere
walls
and
houses
for
the
term
being
left
free
implies
that
the
people
should
enjoy
their
own
laws
xvi
the
nature
of
personal
and
real
treaties
is
a
frequent
subject
of
inquiry
which
may
properly
be
examined
in
this
place
indeed
in
all
transactions
with
a
free
people
the
engagements
entered
into
with
them
are
of
a
real
nature
because
the
subject
of
them
is
a
permanent
thing
so
permanent
that
although
a
republican
be
changed
into
a
regal
government
a
treaty
will
remain
in
force
for
the
political
body
continues
the
same
although
the
head
be
changed
and
the
sovereign
power
which
before
was
diffused
among
many
members
is
now
centered
in
one
yet
this
rule
will
admit
of
an
exception
where
it
is
evident
that
the
specific
form
of
government
made
an
essential
part
of
the
treaty
as
when
two
states
make
a
federal
union
for
the
mutual
preservation
of
their
political
systems
but
if
a
treaty
be
made
with
a
king
or
sovereign
prince
it
does
not
consequently
follow
that
it
is
to
be
considered
only
as
a
personal
and
not
a
real
treaty
for
the
name
of
a
person
may
be
inserted
in
a
treaty
not
merely
to
give
it
the
character
of
a
personal
treaty
but
to
point
out
the
contracting
parties
and
this
will
be
still
more
evident
if
as
is
usual
in
most
treaties
a
clause
is
annexed
declaring
it
to
be
perpetual
or
made
for
the
good
of
the
kingdom
or
with
the
king
himself
and
his
successors
and
it
will
also
be
considered
as
a
real
treaty
even
if
it
is
stated
to
be
passed
for
a
definite
time
the
treaty
between
the
romans
and
philip
king
of
the
macedonians
seems
to
have
been
of
this
description
which
upon
the
refusal
of
his
son
to
continue
it
gave
rise
to
a
war
other
forms
too
besides
those
already
named
and
the
subject
itself
will
frequently
supply
no
improbable
grounds
of
conjecture
but
if
the
conjectures
are
equal
on
both
sides
it
will
remain
that
favourable
treaties
are
supposed
to
be
real
or
permanent
and
odious
ones
only
personal
all
treaties
of
peace
or
commerce
are
favourable
yet
all
treaties
of
war
are
not
odious
especially
those
of
the
defensive
kind
such
a
character
belonging
only
to
offensive
wars
from
the
contemplation
of
the
calamities
which
they
inflict
it
is
presumed
too
that
in
the
formation
of
treaties
the
character
of
each
party
is
taken
into
the
account
and
that
both
are
persuaded
that
neither
of
them
will
commence
hostilities
but
from
just
and
important
causes
what
is
usually
said
of
societies
terminating
with
the
death
of
the
parties
has
no
connection
with
this
subject
but
relates
to
private
societies
the
cognizance
of
which
belongs
to
the
civil
law
whether
it
was
right
or
wrong
therefore
in
the
people
of
fidenae
the
latins
tuscans
and
sabines
upon
the
death
of
romulus
tullus
ancus
priscus
servius
to
abandon
the
respective
treaties
made
with
those
kings
it
is
impossible
for
us
now
to
decide
those
treaties
being
no
longer
extant
on
the
same
point
justin
maintains
a
discussion
whether
those
states
which
had
been
tributary
to
the
medes
were
upon
a
change
of
government
released
from
their
obligations
for
the
thing
to
be
considered
is
whether
the
convention
with
the
medes
had
been
a
voluntary
act
of
their
own
indeed
the
argument
of
bodinus
can
by
no
means
be
admitted
which
is
that
treaties
made
with
kings
extend
not
to
their
successors
for
the
obligation
of
an
oath
is
limited
to
the
person
of
him
who
takes
it
it
is
true
that
the
oath
itself
can
bind
only
the
person
who
takes
it
yet
the
engagements
which
it
confirms
will
be
binding
upon
his
heirs
nor
is
it
to
be
taken
for
an
established
maxim
that
oaths
are
the
only
foundation
on
which
treaties
rest
the
engagement
itself
is
sufficiently
binding
the
oaths
being
only
added
to
give
it
the
greater
sanctity
in
the
consulship
of
publius
valerius
the
roman
people
had
taken
an
oath
to
muster
at
the
command
of
the
consul
upon
his
death
he
was
succeeded
by
lucius
quintius
cincinnatus
some
of
the
tribunes
began
to
quibble
pretending
that
the
people
were
released
from
their
obligation
upon
which
livy
in
his
third
book
remarks
that
at
that
time
they
had
not
degenerated
into
the
disregard
of
religious
obligations
which
marked
his
age
nor
did
every
one
allow
himself
a
latitude
in
explaining
oaths
and
laws
but
thought
that
he
was
bound
to
conform
to
their
literal
meaning
xvii
a
treaty
made
with
a
king
continues
in
force
even
though
the
same
king
or
his
successor
should
be
banished
from
the
kingdom
by
rebellious
subjects
for
the
rights
of
a
king
among
which
his
alliances
may
be
reckoned
remain
unimpaired
during
the
temporary
loss
of
his
throne
a
case
to
which
the
expression
of
lucan
may
be
applied
that
order
never
loses
its
rights
under
any
change
of
circumstances
xviii
on
the
other
hand
any
war
if
it
be
with
the
consent
of
the
lawful
sovereign
made
upon
the
invader
of
his
kingdom
or
upon
the
usurper
of
a
free
people
rights
before
his
usurpation
has
received
public
sanction
will
be
deemed
no
infraction
of
any
former
treaty
with
the
established
authorities
of
that
kingdom
or
country
for
acts
of
usurpation
convey
not
immediately
any
right
beyond
that
of
bare
possession
and
this
is
what
was
said
by
titus
quintius
to
nabis
we
made
no
treaty
of
alliance
and
amity
with
you
but
with
the
just
and
lawful
king
of
the
lacedaemonians
for
in
treaties
the
characters
of
king
successor
and
the
like
carry
with
them
an
idea
of
a
peculiar
and
lawful
right
which
must
always
render
the
cause
of
usurpers
odious
xix
it
was
a
question
formerly
discussed
by
chrysippus
whether
a
prize
promised
to
him
who
first
reached
the
goal
could
be
given
to
two
who
reached
it
at
the
same
time
or
to
neither
but
as
rewards
of
merit
are
things
of
a
favourable
nature
it
is
the
juster
opinion
that
they
should
divide
the
prize
although
scipio
caesar
and
julian
acted
more
liberally
in
giving
the
entire
prizes
to
each
of
those
who
had
ascended
the
walls
together
what
has
been
already
said
upon
the
literal
or
figurative
application
of
the
words
in
interpreting
treaties
will
be
sufficient
xx
there
is
also
another
kind
of
interpretation
arising
from
conjectures
which
apply
exactly
to
the
signification
of
the
words
containing
a
promise
or
engagement
and
that
is
of
a
twofold
description
either
extending
or
limiting
the
meaning
but
it
is
more
difficult
to
extend
than
to
limit
the
acceptation
of
expressions
for
as
in
all
matters
the
want
of
one
essential
requisite
is
sufficient
to
defeat
their
effect
so
in
engagements
those
conjectures
which
extend
the
obligation
are
not
readily
to
be
admitted
and
it
is
much
more
difficult
here
than
in
the
case
above
mentioned
where
words
allow
a
more
extensive
but
less
familiar
acceptation
for
here
it
is
seeking
a
conjecture
to
extend
the
words
of
a
promise
the
conjecture
therefore
which
is
to
create
an
obligation
ought
to
be
very
certain
nor
is
it
sufficient
that
there
is
some
resemblance
in
the
motives
for
the
motive
produced
to
confirm
an
obligation
must
be
exactly
the
same
as
that
of
the
case
under
consideration
neither
is
it
always
proper
to
allege
a
motive
for
extending
an
obligation
because
as
it
has
been
already
said
motives
in
actuating
us
to
form
engagements
may
sometimes
be
swayed
by
the
will
which
often
acts
independently
of
any
just
motive
to
authorise
therefore
such
an
extension
it
must
be
evident
that
the
motive
produced
as
an
example
and
authority
was
the
sole
and
effectual
cause
which
influenced
the
promiser
and
that
he
considered
it
in
the
same
extensive
view
for
otherwise
it
would
have
been
unjust
and
prejudicial
the
ancients
in
their
treatises
on
rhetoric
follow
the
same
rule
when
in
speaking
of
the
letter
and
design
they
give
us
one
invariable
form
of
expressing
the
same
sentiment
but
in
their
syllogisms
or
arts
of
reasoning
they
point
out
a
way
of
interpreting
what
is
not
written
by
what
is
written
in
the
same
manner
too
legal
writers
lay
down
rules
for
avoiding
frauds
now
if
at
a
time
when
there
was
no
other
mode
of
fortifying
towns
than
by
surrounding
them
with
walls
it
were
stipulated
that
a
certain
place
should
not
be
so
surrounded
it
is
evident
that
to
employ
any
other
means
of
fortification
would
be
a
breach
of
that
treaty
as
in
the
above
case
the
interpretation
must
be
extended
to
guard
against
every
possible
evasion
so
in
the
following
example
the
prohibition
to
assemble
an
armed
force
to
assail
us
includes
all
kinds
of
violence
and
force
by
which
our
lives
and
security
may
be
endangered
xxi
hence
may
be
solved
the
question
to
be
found
in
gellius
respecting
a
commission
whether
it
can
be
fulfilled
by
doing
not
the
immediate
act
required
but
some
thing
equivalent
to
it
or
in
a
manner
more
beneficial
than
in
the
form
prescribed
for
this
deviation
from
the
written
rule
may
be
proper
and
lawful
where
the
prescribed
form
is
not
essential
towards
attaining
the
object
or
where
by
departing
from
it
that
object
can
be
better
accomplished
according
to
the
answer
given
by
scaevola
that
the
person
required
to
be
bail
and
security
for
another
may
give
an
order
to
a
third
person
to
pay
that
money
to
the
creditor
but
where
such
a
latitude
of
interpretation
is
not
evidently
admissible
we
must
adhere
to
what
gellius
has
said
in
the
same
place
that
it
would
be
a
dissolution
of
all
trusts
if
the
party
acting
in
commission
were
in
all
cases
left
to
his
own
discretion
rather
than
bound
by
his
written
instructions
xxii
an
interpretation
restricted
more
closely
than
the
literal
signification
of
the
words
containing
a
promise
absolutely
requires
may
arise
either
from
some
original
defect
in
the
intention
of
the
promiser
or
from
some
subsequent
emergency
repugnant
to
such
intention
thus
if
it
were
evident
that
an
absurdity
would
follow
the
fulfilment
of
a
promise
this
would
be
sufficient
to
prove
an
original
defect
in
the
intention
because
no
man
can
be
supposed
to
have
deliberately
intended
doing
an
absurd
act
or
if
the
sole
and
effectual
reason
by
which
the
promise
was
influenced
should
have
ceased
the
obligation
also
would
be
void
the
sole
ground
on
which
it
rested
being
no
longer
in
existence
xxiii
in
the
next
place
where
any
sufficient
reason
can
evidently
be
assigned
for
a
promise
or
engagement
it
is
not
the
substance
of
the
promise
itself
which
is
to
be
considered
so
much
as
the
reason
for
which
that
promise
was
given
xxiv
thirdly
the
contending
parties
must
always
be
supposed
to
have
in
contemplation
the
subject
and
nothing
but
the
subject
however
extensive
a
signification
the
words
may
seem
to
bear
this
method
of
interpretation
also
is
handled
by
the
ancient
rhetorical
writers
in
speaking
of
expression
and
design
and
they
place
it
under
the
head
of
variations
in
opinion
xxv
in
speaking
of
motives
and
reasons
it
is
proper
to
observe
that
they
some
times
comprehend
things
considered
not
according
to
their
actual
existence
but
according
to
their
moral
consequences
in
which
case
it
is
by
no
means
right
to
limit
the
words
of
a
treaty
to
their
literal
meaning
but
the
utmost
extent
of
interpretation
is
allowable
in
order
to
maintain
the
spirit
as
well
as
the
letter
of
such
treaties
thus
if
it
be
stipulated
that
no
troops
or
ships
shall
be
brought
to
a
certain
place
or
within
a
certain
distance
the
prohibition
excludes
all
ships
or
troops
from
being
brought
thither
even
under
the
fairest
and
most
harmless
pretences
for
the
purport
of
the
treaty
is
to
guard
not
only
against
actual
mischief
but
even
against
remote
danger
it
is
a
point
often
disputed
whether
the
continuance
of
things
in
their
present
state
is
a
tacit
condition
on
which
the
fulfilment
of
all
promises
is
founded
a
position
that
can
by
no
means
be
maintained
unless
it
appears
that
such
continuance
was
the
sole
motive
upon
which
the
treaties
were
made
as
in
many
parts
of
history
we
read
of
ambassadors
having
relinquished
their
missions
and
returned
home
upon
finding
the
state
of
things
so
changed
that
the
object
of
their
embassies
was
at
an
end
xxvi
when
an
emergency
arises
repugnant
to
the
general
intention
of
an
act
it
is
explained
by
the
ancient
masters
of
rhetoric
under
the
head
of
expression
and
design
now
this
variation
between
the
emergency
and
the
intention
is
of
a
twofold
nature
for
the
will
and
its
intention
are
to
be
collected
either
from
natural
reason
or
from
some
outward
sign
in
judging
of
the
will
by
natural
reason
aristotle
who
has
treated
the
subject
with
great
accuracy
makes
the
mind
the
seat
of
judgment
and
the
will
the
seat
of
equity
which
he
nobly
defines
to
be
the
correction
of
that
wherein
the
law
by
reason
of
its
universal
nature
is
defective
and
upon
this
principle
all
wills
and
treaties
ought
to
be
interpreted
for
as
all
cases
could
neither
be
foreseen
nor
expressed
by
the
lawgiver
it
is
necessary
to
leave
a
power
of
excepting
the
cases
which
he
himself
would
have
excepted
if
he
were
present
yet
this
is
not
to
be
done
upon
light
grounds
for
that
would
be
exercising
a
controul
over
the
acts
of
another
but
is
only
to
be
established
upon
the
clearest
evidence
and
strongest
proofs
the
clearest
proof
we
can
have
of
a
want
of
equity
is
where
following
the
literal
meaning
of
the
words
would
be
unlawful
that
is
repugnant
to
natural
or
divine
precepts
for
such
things
as
are
incapable
of
obligation
are
necessarily
to
be
excepted
quintilian
the
elder
says
some
things
although
comprehended
within
the
meaning
of
no
law
form
a
natural
exception
thus
any
one
who
has
promised
to
return
a
sword
that
has
been
given
up
to
him
ought
not
to
return
it
into
the
hands
of
a
madman
as
danger
might
result
from
it
to
himself
or
to
other
innocent
persons
likewise
a
thing
which
has
been
deposited
with
any
one
ought
not
to
be
returned
to
the
hands
of
the
person
who
gave
the
pledge
if
the
real
owner
demands
it
i
prove
this
says
triphonius
to
be
justice
which
assigns
to
every
one
his
own
without
disturbing
the
still
juster
claims
of
another
for
the
reason
it
has
been
already
observed
is
founded
on
the
institution
of
property
which
makes
it
unjust
not
to
return
a
thing
when
the
real
owner
is
known
xxvii
the
need
of
equity
too
will
appear
in
cases
where
following
the
literal
meaning
of
the
words
will
not
be
absolutely
unlawful
yet
upon
a
fair
estimation
will
be
found
too
hard
and
intolerable
it
might
impose
a
hardship
inconsistent
with
the
general
condition
of
human
nature
or
upon
comparing
the
person
and
matter
under
consideration
with
each
other
it
might
be
found
at
variance
with
the
general
intent
of
all
law
which
is
to
prevent
evil
and
to
redress
injury
thus
if
a
person
has
lent
a
sum
of
money
or
any
other
thing
for
a
certain
time
he
may
justly
require
the
repayment
or
restoration
of
it
within
that
time
if
he
has
great
need
of
it
himself
for
acts
of
kindness
are
of
such
a
nature
that
no
one
can
be
supposed
intentionally
to
bind
himself
thereby
to
manifest
inconvenience
or
prejudice
in
the
same
manner
a
sovereign
who
has
promised
assistance
to
an
ally
will
in
equity
be
excused
from
fulfilling
his
engagement
if
he
wants
all
his
strength
at
home
to
ward
off
danger
or
hostilities
the
grant
also
of
immunities
or
privileges
in
ordinary
cases
can
not
be
pleaded
as
an
exemption
or
exception
from
the
services
which
the
state
in
particular
emergencies
requires
from
the
above
instances
it
appears
that
cicero
has
too
loosely
worded
his
proposition
that
such
promises
as
are
prejudicial
to
the
person
to
whom
they
are
given
are
not
to
be
kept
nor
if
they
are
more
prejudicial
to
the
party
giving
than
beneficial
to
the
person
receiving
them
for
it
should
not
be
left
to
the
promiser
to
judge
whether
the
fulfilment
of
his
engagement
will
be
serviceable
to
the
party
receiving
it
except
in
the
case
of
the
madman
cited
above
nor
is
any
trivial
or
imaginary
prejudice
that
might
result
from
it
sufficient
to
release
the
obligation
but
it
ought
to
be
such
as
according
to
the
nature
of
the
act
would
necessarily
be
supposed
to
form
an
exception
thus
any
one
having
promised
his
assistance
to
a
neighbour
at
a
certain
period
would
not
be
bound
to
his
engagement
if
he
were
detained
at
home
by
the
sickness
of
a
father
or
a
child
a
case
which
cicero
in
his
first
book
of
offices
has
put
in
the
following
terms
if
any
one
has
undertaken
to
manage
a
cause
and
in
the
mean
time
his
son
is
taken
ill
it
will
be
no
breach
of
duty
in
him
not
to
perform
what
he
has
promised
there
is
a
passage
in
the
fourth
book
of
seneca
on
benefits
to
the
same
effect
i
am
liable
to
be
charged
with
levity
and
a
breach
of
faith
if
things
continuing
as
they
were
when
i
made
a
promise
i
do
not
perform
my
engagement
but
if
any
change
has
taken
place
it
leaves
me
at
liberty
to
reconsider
the
matter
and
releases
the
obligation
i
promised
my
support
in
court
and
it
afterwards
appeared
that
the
cause
would
be
prejudicial
to
my
own
father
i
promised
to
take
a
journey
but
afterwards
heard
that
the
road
was
infested
with
robbers
i
promised
my
presence
on
some
particular
occasion
but
was
prevented
from
attending
by
the
sickness
of
a
son
in
all
these
cases
to
bind
me
to
my
engagement
the
circumstances
ought
to
remain
exactly
the
same
as
they
were
when
i
made
the
promise
xxviii
it
has
been
said
that
there
are
other
indications
of
intention
which
require
an
equitable
exception
in
favour
of
the
present
case
and
among
such
proofs
there
can
be
nothing
stronger
than
the
same
words
used
in
another
place
not
where
they
directly
oppose
the
present
meaning
for
that
would
amount
to
a
contradiction
but
where
they
clash
with
it
owing
to
some
unexpected
emergency
which
the
greek
rhetoricians
call
a
circumstantial
disagreement
xxix
when
there
is
any
accidental
collision
between
one
part
of
a
written
document
and
another
cicero
in
the
second
book
of
his
treatise
on
invention
has
given
rules
for
deciding
which
of
them
ought
to
have
the
preference
though
his
arrangement
is
not
very
accurate
yet
it
is
by
no
means
to
be
neglected
to
supply
therefore
this
defect
of
accuracy
the
rules
may
be
digested
in
the
following
order
in
the
first
place
a
permission
ought
to
give
way
to
a
command
because
a
permission
appears
to
be
granted
only
in
case
there
is
no
weightier
objection
than
its
being
an
exception
to
a
positive
precept
nor
any
preponderance
in
favour
of
an
opposite
determination
consequently
as
the
writer
to
herennius
says
what
is
positively
prescribed
is
more
powerful
than
a
bare
permission
in
the
next
place
what
is
required
to
be
done
at
a
fixed
time
should
have
the
preference
to
what
may
be
done
at
any
time
from
whence
it
follows
that
the
prohibitions
of
a
treaty
are
generally
of
more
weight
than
its
injunctions
because
the
prohibitory
power
operates
at
all
times
but
it
is
not
so
with
injunctions
unless
an
express
time
for
their
fulfilment
is
named
or
they
contain
a
tacit
prohibition
among
those
treaties
which
in
the
above
named
respects
are
equal
the
preference
is
given
to
such
as
are
more
particular
and
approach
nearer
to
the
point
in
question
for
where
particulars
are
stated
the
case
is
clearer
and
requires
fewer
exceptions
than
general
rules
do
those
prohibitions
which
have
a
penalty
annexed
to
them
are
of
greater
weight
than
those
which
have
not
and
those
with
a
greater
penalty
are
enforced
in
preference
to
those
that
have
a
less
those
engagements
also
which
are
founded
upon
causes
of
less
magnitude
and
importance
ought
to
give
way
to
those
which
have
more
laudable
and
useful
objects
in
view
lastly
it
is
to
be
observed
that
a
subsequent
law
or
treaty
always
repeals
a
former
from
what
has
been
said
an
inference
may
be
drawn
in
favour
of
sworn
treaties
or
agreements
that
they
ought
to
be
taken
in
the
most
usual
acceptation
of
the
words
rejecting
all
implied
limitations
and
exceptions
and
such
as
are
not
immediately
necessary
to
the
subject
consequently
in
a
case
where
a
sworn
treaty
or
engagement
may
happen
to
clash
with
another
not
enforced
by
the
obligation
of
an
oath
the
preference
ought
to
be
given
to
the
former
xxx
it
is
often
asked
whether
in
doubtful
points
a
contract
should
be
deemed
perfect
before
the
writings
are
made
and
delivered
we
find
in
appian
history
of
the
mithridatic
war
that
it
was
upon
this
very
ground
murena
objected
to
the
convention
between
sylla
and
mithridates
however
it
appears
plain
unless
it
has
been
settled
to
the
contrary
that
writing
ought
to
be
considered
admissible
as
evidence
of
a
contract
though
not
as
part
of
the
substance
otherwise
it
is
usually
expressed
as
in
the
truce
with
nabis
which
was
to
be
ratified
from
the
day
the
terms
were
written
and
delivered
to
him
xxxi
we
can
by
no
means
admit
the
rule
laid
down
by
some
writers
who
maintain
that
all
engagements
of
kings
and
states
ought
to
be
explained
as
far
as
it
is
possible
upon
the
principles
of
the
roman
law
unless
indeed
it
can
be
made
to
appear
that
among
some
states
in
their
intercourse
with
each
other
the
civil
law
is
received
as
the
law
of
nations
a
presumption
which
ought
not
to
be
hastily
granted
xxxii
as
to
the
doubt
which
plutarch
advances
in
his
symposiacs
whether
the
words
of
the
party
offering
or
those
of
the
one
accepting
a
condition
ought
to
be
most
attended
to
it
appears
that
where
the
party
accepting
the
terms
is
the
promiser
the
nature
and
substance
of
the
transaction
will
depend
upon
his
words
if
they
are
absolute
and
unqualified
for
if
the
offer
is
regarded
as
a
positive
engagement
to
do
certain
acts
then
the
full
extent
of
it
will
be
seen
by
the
necessary
repetition
of
the
same
words
in
the
promise
but
before
a
condition
is
accepted
it
is
evident
as
was
seen
in
the
chapter
on
promises
that
the
promiser
is
not
bound
to
its
fulfilment
for
no
right
has
been
conferred
by
the
one
party
or
acquired
by
the
other
therefore
the
offer
of
a
condition
of
this
kind
does
not
amount
to
a
perfect
promise

i
it
has
been
said
above
that
the
rights
due
to
us
arise
from
three
sources
which
are
contract
injury
and
law
it
is
unnecessary
here
to
dwell
upon
the
nature
of
contracts
which
has
been
already
so
fully
discussed
the
next
point
therefore
to
which
we
proceed
is
an
inquiry
into
the
rights
resulting
to
us
from
injuries
received
here
the
name
of
crime
or
misdemeanor
is
applied
to
every
act
of
commission
or
neglect
repugnant
to
the
duties
required
of
all
men
either
from
their
common
nature
or
particular
calling
for
such
offences
naturally
create
an
obligation
to
repair
the
loss
or
injury
that
has
been
sustained
ii
by
loss
is
meant
a
diminution
of
what
any
one
possesses
whether
it
be
a
right
derived
to
him
purely
from
the
law
of
nature
or
from
the
addition
of
human
authority
that
is
from
the
law
of
property
contract
or
civil
law
god
has
given
life
to
man
not
to
destroy
but
to
preserve
it
assigning
to
him
for
this
purpose
a
right
to
the
free
enjoyment
of
personal
liberty
reputation
and
the
controul
over
his
own
actions
the
manner
in
which
property
and
contracts
convey
to
any
one
a
right
to
things
as
well
as
to
the
service
of
another
has
been
shewn
in
the
preceding
part
of
this
treatise
in
the
same
manner
from
the
law
every
man
derives
his
peculiar
right
because
the
law
has
the
same
if
not
greater
power
over
persons
and
things
than
individuals
themselves
have
thus
by
the
appointment
of
law
a
ward
has
a
right
to
demand
the
strictest
diligence
of
a
guardian
the
state
of
a
magistrate
and
not
only
the
state
but
every
subject
has
a
right
to
require
it
where
the
law
expressly
declares
or
evidently
implies
that
certain
acts
shall
be
performed
but
the
bare
circumstance
of
an
action
being
fit
or
proper
gives
not
the
right
of
political
justice
to
demand
its
performance
nor
does
the
neglect
of
it
entitle
the
party
suffering
to
any
legal
redress
because
it
does
not
follow
that
a
thing
must
belong
to
a
person
because
it
is
fit
or
beneficial
for
him
thus
as
aristotle
says
there
is
no
actual
injustice
though
it
may
be
illiberal
to
refuse
assisting
another
with
money
to
the
same
purpose
cicero
in
his
speech
for
cneius
plancus
says
that
giving
their
votes
to
whom
they
please
or
withholding
them
if
they
think
proper
is
the
true
characteristic
of
a
free
people
he
afterwards
indeed
corrects
his
assertion
by
adding
that
they
may
happen
to
do
what
they
like
rather
than
what
they
ought
to
do
taking
the
word
ought
to
signify
propriety
iii
a
precaution
is
necessary
here
in
order
to
avoid
confounding
things
of
a
different
kind
now
those
who
are
entrusted
with
the
power
of
appointing
magistrates
are
bound
from
motives
of
public
good
to
chuse
the
properest
persons
and
this
is
what
the
state
has
a
right
to
require
of
them
they
are
bound
therefore
to
repair
any
loss
which
the
state
may
sustain
by
the
choice
of
improper
persons
so
any
subject
who
is
not
disqualified
though
he
has
no
peculiar
right
to
an
office
has
an
equal
right
with
others
to
endeavour
to
obtain
it
in
the
exercise
of
which
right
if
he
is
obstructed
by
violence
or
fraud
he
may
recover
damages
not
to
the
full
value
of
the
office
which
he
sought
but
according
to
the
probable
loss
which
he
may
reasonably
be
supposed
to
have
suffered
similar
which
is
the
right
of
a
legatee
when
a
testator
has
been
prevented
by
fraud
or
violence
from
making
a
bequest
for
the
capability
of
receiving
a
legacy
is
a
kind
of
right
which
to
obstruct
a
testator
from
conferring
is
undoubtedly
an
injury
iv
the
loss
or
diminution
of
any
one
possessions
is
not
confined
to
injuries
done
to
the
substance
alone
of
the
property
but
includes
every
thing
affecting
the
produce
of
it
whether
it
has
been
gathered
or
not
if
the
owner
himself
had
reaped
it
the
necessary
expence
of
reaping
or
of
improving
the
property
to
raise
a
produce
must
also
be
taken
into
the
account
of
his
loss
and
form
part
of
the
damages
for
it
is
an
established
maxim
that
no
one
ought
to
derive
benefit
from
the
loss
of
another
damages
are
to
be
computed
too
not
according
to
any
actual
gain
but
according
to
the
reasonable
expectation
of
it
which
in
the
case
of
a
growing
crop
may
be
judged
of
by
the
general
abundance
or
scarcity
of
that
particular
season
vi
but
besides
the
person
immediately
doing
an
injury
others
may
be
bound
also
to
repair
the
losses
of
the
suffering
party
for
as
a
person
may
be
guilty
of
offences
by
negligence
as
well
as
by
the
commission
of
certain
acts
so
they
may
be
done
also
by
accessories
as
well
as
principals
now
a
principal
in
any
crime
or
offence
is
one
that
urges
to
the
commission
of
it
that
gives
all
possible
consent
that
aids
abets
or
in
any
shape
is
a
partner
in
the
perpetration
of
it
vii
an
accessory
is
one
who
gives
his
counsel
approbation
and
assent
for
where
is
the
difference
says
cicero
in
his
second
philippic
between
advising
an
act
and
approving
of
it
viii
and
ix
the
obligation
to
repair
the
losses
suffered
by
negligence
may
be
considered
in
a
light
firstly
when
any
person
whose
peculiar
office
it
is
neglects
either
to
forbid
the
commission
of
an
injury
or
to
assist
the
injured
party
and
secondly
when
the
person
who
ought
to
do
it
either
does
not
dissuade
from
the
commission
of
an
offence
or
passes
over
in
silence
what
he
is
bound
to
make
known
in
these
cases
when
it
is
said
that
a
person
ought
to
do
or
to
forbear
doing
certain
actions
it
is
meant
that
he
is
bound
by
that
right
which
strict
justice
requires
whether
that
duty
arises
from
law
or
from
the
capacity
which
the
person
bears
for
though
it
may
be
wrong
to
omit
any
duty
enjoined
by
the
law
of
charity
there
can
be
no
redress
for
such
omission
but
every
legal
remedy
must
be
founded
on
some
peculiar
right
x
it
is
to
be
observed
also
that
all
the
parties
if
they
have
been
the
real
occasion
of
loss
to
any
one
or
have
abetted
the
person
doing
him
the
injury
are
so
far
implicated
in
the
guilt
as
to
be
liable
to
full
damages
or
at
least
proportionably
to
the
part
they
have
taken
for
it
may
and
often
does
happen
that
a
crime
would
have
been
committed
by
an
offender
even
without
the
aid
of
other
principals
or
accessories
in
which
case
he
alone
is
answerable
yet
neither
principals
nor
accessories
will
be
allowed
to
plead
as
an
excuse
that
if
they
had
not
aided
or
abetted
others
would
have
been
found
to

if
it
appears
that
without
such
assistance
from
them
the
crime
would
never
have
been
committed
for
those
other
imaginary
abettors
would
themselves
have
been
answerable
if
they
had
given
their

the

have
compelled

urged
any
one
to
the
commission
of
an
offence

the

he
subjoins
the
following
remark
although
the
mischief
went
further
than
was
intended
yet
the
person
doing
it
was
answerable
for
the
whole
as
much
as
if
he
had
done
it
by
design
for
any
one
that
puts
his
defence
upon
the
plea
of
unintentional
injury
ought
to
have
abstained
from
all
mischief
whatsoever
when
ariarathes
king
of
cappadocia
had
wantonly
obstructed
the
channel
of
the
river
melas
which
discharges
itself
into
the
euphrates
the

the

rose
to
such
a
height
as
to
occasion
excessive
damage
to
the
cappadocians
the
galatians
and
the
phrygians
upon
which
the
decision
of
the
matter
being
left
to
the

imposed
upon
him
a
fine
of
three
hundred
talents

but
to
proceed
with
other
instances
of
injury
which
render
the
parties
committing
them
liable
to
repair
the
losses
occasioned
thereby
the
case
of
excusable
homicide
may
be
alleged
as
one
wherein
the
person
who
has
committed
it
is
bound
to
make
every
reasonable
compensation
to
the
family
dependents
and
connections
of
the
deceased
party
in
proportion
to
the
loss
which
they
have
sustained
from
his
death
as
michael
the
ephesian
in
the
fifth
book
of
aristotle
ethics
has
observed
that
the
compensation
made
to
the
parents
the
wife
or
children
of
the
deceased
is
nearly
the
same
as
if
it
could
be
made
to
himself
the
writer
is
here
speaking
of
excusable
homicide
that
is
when
the
person
by
whom
it
is
committed
does
it
not
in
the
immediate
discharge
of
some
legal
duty
wherefore
if
any
one
in
defending
himself
has
killed
another
from
whom
he
might
have
escaped
though
he
may
have
violated
the
law
of
charity
yet
he
has
not
incurred
the
penalty
of
a
capital
offence
upon
the
same
principle
the
person
who
has
maimed
or
mutilated
another
will
be
bound
to
make
him
a
compensation
proportionably
to
the
means
of
subsistence
which
he
is
deprived
of
by
such
a
calamity
a
thief
or
a
robber
is
bound
to
restore
what
has
been
taken
and
to
return
it
with
all
the
improvements
it
may
have
acquired
or
to
make
reparation

the
owner

to
the
gain
which
the
privation
has
prevented
him
from
making
or
to
the
actual
value
of
the
thing
itself
if
the
thing
has

the

we
may
rank
all

who

xviii
when
a
person
has
himself
been
the
occasion
of
the
fraud
or

the
consequences
are
imputable
to
his
own
conduct
for
where
a

gives
rise
to
involuntary

those

considered
in

the

of
the
exercise

will
xix
but
to
connect
the
preceding
cases
and
arguments
with
public
and
national
concerns
it
is
necessary
to
observe
that
it
is
a
maxim
introduced
and
established
by
the
consent
of
all
nations
that
the
wars
which
are
declared
and
conducted
by
the
authority
of
the
sovereign
power
on
both
sides
are
alone
entitled
to
the
denomination
of
just
wars
and
the
enemy
has
no
right
to
demand
restitution
for
what
the
prosecution
of
such
wars
has
reduced
him
to
abandon
through
fear
it
is
upon
this
principle
we
admit
the
distinction
which
cicero
has
made
between
an
enemy
towards
whom
the
consent
and
law
of
nations
oblige
us
to
observe
many
common
rights
and
between
robbers
and
pirates
for
any
thing
given
up
to
pirates
or
robbers
through
fear
is
no
lawful
prize
but
it
may
be
recovered
unless
a
solemn
oath
of
renunciation
has
been
taken
this
is
not
the
case
with
the
captures
made
in
just
war
the
justification
which
polybius
makes
for
the
carthaginians
in
the
second
punic
war
carries
with
it
an
appearance
of
equity
though
it
is
not
a
question
immediately
founded
upon
the
law
of
nations
they
alleged
as
a
reason
for
their
making
that
war
that
when
they
were
engaged
in
quelling
a
mutiny
of
their
own
mercenaries
the
romans
had
declared
war
seized
upon
sardinia
and
levied
contributions
of
money
xx
sovereign
princes
and
states
are
answerable
for
their
neglect
if
they
use
not
all
the
proper
means
within
their
power
for
suppressing
piracy
and
robbery
and
on
this
account
the
scyrians
were
formerly
condemned
by
the
amphictyonic
council
when
some
of
the
states
of
the
united
provinces
had
on
a
particular
occasion
granted
commissions
to
many
privateers
and
those
adventurers
plundered
friends
and
enemies
alike
and
became
general
pirates
it
was
a
subject
of
great
discussion
whether
those
states
were
justified
in
having
made
use
of
the
services
of
desperate
and
abandoned
men
without
exacting
sufficient
security
for
their
good
conduct
at
that
time
it
was
maintained
that
they
were
bound
to
nothing
more
than
to
punish
or
deliver
up
the
offenders
if
they
could
be
found
and
to
see
justice
done
by
a
forfeiture
of
their
property
for
they
themselves
had
neither
authorised
those
unjust
acts
of
plunder
nor
shared
in
the
fruits
of
them
they
had
even
strictly
prohibited
the
privateers
from
molesting
the
subjects
of
friendly
powers
as
to
their
taking
securities
there
was
no
obligation
to
do
that
for
they
had
a
right
to
grant
a
general
commission
to
all
their
subjects
to
seize
upon
the
enemy
property
a
thing
which
had
frequently
been
done
nor
could
that
particular
commission
be
considered
as
an
act
of
injustice
against
either
allies
or
neutrals
since
even
without
such
permission
individuals
might
have
fitted
and
sent
out
armed
vessels
the
states
could
not
foresee
nor
consequently
provide
against
the
misconduct
of
those
adventurers
who
had
exceeded
their
commission
and
if
nations
were
to
decline
using
the
assistance
of
wicked
men
no
army
could
ever
be
collected
and
it
has
been
confirmed
by
the
authority
both
of
france
and
england
that
a
sovereign
can
not
answer
for
every
injury
done
to
the
subjects
of
a
friendly
power
by
his
naval
or
military
forces
especially
if
it
is
plain
that
they
acted
in
violation
of
his
orders
but
in
what
cases
any
one
is
released
from
being
answerable
for
what
is
done
by
his
subordinate
agents
is
a
point
not
so
much
for
the
law
of
nations
as
for
the
municipal
law
and
particularly
the
maritime
code
of
each
country
to
decide
in
a
case
similar
to
that
alluded
to
a
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
judicature
was
made
against
the
pomeranians
two
centuries
at
least
before
xxi
it
is
the
civil
law
too
which
makes
an
owner
answerable
for
the
mischief
or
damage
done
by
his
slave
or
by
his
cattle
for
in
the
eye
of
natural
justice
he
is
not
to
blame
so
neither
is
the
person
whose
ship
by
running
foul
of
another
has
damaged
it
though
by
the
laws
of
many
nations
and
of
ours
among
the
rest
the
damages
are
usually
divided
between
both
parties
owing
to
the
difficulty
of
deciding
who
was
in
fault
xxii
damages
are
allowed
too
for
any
injury
done
to
our
honour
or
reputation
by
assault
slander
or
various
other
ways
in
which
as
well
as
in
theft
and
other
crimes
the
nature
of
the
offence
is
to
be
estimated
by
its
consequences
for
the
reparation
in
such
cases
answers
to
the
penalty
imposed
for
crimes
and
that
reparation
is
made
some
times
by
acknowledging
the
injured
party
innocence
and
some
times
by
a
compensation
in
money
which
is
a
standard
value
of
all
things

of
the

character

i
hitherto
the
pursuit
of
our
inquiries
has
led
us
to
examine
those
rights
to
which
we
are
entitled
by
the
law
of
nature
occasionally
touching
upon
those
points
where
its
authority
is
farther
confirmed
by
the
voluntary
law
of
nations
and
that
voluntary
law
as
it
is
called
gives
rise
to
certain
obligations
which
now
remain
for
our
discussion
and
in
which
the
rights
of
ambassadors
form
a
leading
feature
almost
every
page
of
history
offers
some
remark
on
the
inviolable
rights
of
ambassadors
and
the
security
of
their
persons
a
security
sanctioned
by
every
clause
and
precept
of
human
and
revealed
law
nor
is
it
surprising
that
the
persons
of
those
should
be
deemed
inviolable
who
form
the
principal
link
in
that
chain
by
which
sovereigns
and
independent
states
maintain
their
intercourse
with
each
other
to
offer
violence
to
them
is
not
only
an
act
of
injustice
but
as
philip
in
his
letter
to
the
athenians
says
is
acknowledged
by
all
to
be
an
act
of
impiety
ii
but
whatever
rights
the
law
of
nations
may
confer
upon
ambassadors
it
is
necessary
in
the
first
place
to
observe
that
none
are
entitled
to
them
but
those
who
are
sent
by
the
sovereigns
of
independent
countries
to
each
other
for
the
privileges
of
provincial
or
municipal
deputies
sent
to
the
states
general
of
any
country
are
regulated
by
the
particular
laws
of
that
country
and
not
by
the
law
of
nations
thus
we
find
in
the
first
book
of
livy
an
ambassador
styling
himself
a
public
messenger
of
the
roman
people
and
in
the
sixth
book
of
the
same
historian
we
have
a
declaration
of
the
senate
confining
the
rights
of
embassies
to
the
intercourse
between
foreign
powers
and
excluding
citizens
from
the
same
privileges
in
their
transactions
with
each
other
upon
this
topic
the
authority
of
cicero
may
be
cited
who
in
order
to
shew
the
impropriety
of
sending
ambassadors
to
antony
observes
that
they
are
not
dealing
with
a
hannibal
or
a
foreign
enemy
but
with
one
of
their
own
citizens
now
virgil
has
so
clearly
explained
who
are
to
be
reckoned
foreigners
that
we
need
not
have
recourse
to
lawyers
to
understand
what
is
so
well
expressed
by
the
poet
who
says
i
look
upon
every
country
as
foreign
which
owns
not
the
sway
of
our
sceptre
aen
vii
a
state
therefore
connected
with
another
though
by
an
unequal
treaty
if
it
retain
its
independence
will
have
a
right
of
sending
embassies
the
princes
of
germany
who
were
in
some
respects
subject
to
the
emperor
as
their
head
being
sovereign
princes
possessed
the
right
of
sending
ambassadors
to
foreign
states
but
kings
who
have
been
entirely
subdued
in
just
war
and
stripped
of
their
dominions
have
with
all
their
other
sovereign
rights
lost
that
of
sending
ambassadors
it
was
for
this
reason
that
paulus
aemilius
made
prisoners
of
the
messengers
sent
to
him
by
perseus
whom
he
had
conquered
in
civil
wars
necessity
sometimes
gives
birth
to
new
rights
in
violation
of
former
rules
when
for
instance
a
kingdom
is
so
equally
divided
between
two
parties
that
it
is
a
matter
of
doubt
which
of
them
constitutes
the
nation
or
in
a
disputed
succession
between
two
claimants
of
the
crown
the
kingdom
may
be
considered
as
forming
two
nations
at
the
same
time
tacitus
considering
each
party
in
such
cases
as
entitled
to
the
rights
of
the
law
of
nations
condemns
the
flavians
for
having
in
the
rage
of
civil
dissensions
violated
in
the
persons
of
the
vitellian
ambassadors
those
privileges
which
are
respected
even
among
foreign
nations
pirates
and
robbers
as
they
form
no
civil
community
can
not
rest
any
claim
to
protection
and
support
upon
the
law
of
nations
tiberius
as
we
are
informed
by
tacitus
when
tacfarinas
sent
ambassadors
to
him
spurned
at
the
idea
of
treating
with
a
robber
as
with
a
lawful
enemy
yet
sometimes
a
pledge
of
public
faith
and
the
rights
of
embassy
are
allowed
to
men
of
that
description
which
was
done
by
pompey
to
the
fugitives
from
the
pyrenean
forest
iii
there
are
two
points
upon
which
the
privileges
granted
by
the
law
of
nations
to
ambassadors
turn
in
the
first
place
they
have
a
right
to
be
admitted
into
any
country
and
secondly
to
be
protected
from
all
personal
violence
respecting
the
former
of
these
points
there
is
a
passage
in
the
eleventh
book
of
livy
where
hanno
a
carthaginian
senator
inveighs
against
hannibal
for
not
having
admitted
into
his
camp
ambassadors
who
came
from
the
allies
and
on
their
behalf
as
he
had
thereby
overturned
the
law
of
nations
but
this
rule
by
no
means
compels
nations
to
give
an
unqualified
admission
to
all
ambassadors
for
that
is
what
the
law
of
nations
can
never
intend
it
only
prohibits
the
refusal
of
admission
without
sufficient
grounds
there
are
various
motives
which
may
afford
a
sufficient
plea
for
such
refusal
there
may
be
an
objection
to
the
power
who
offers
to
treat
to
the
person
sent
upon
the
embassy
or
perhaps
to
the
object
of
his
mission
thus
at
the
suggestion
of
pericles
melesippus
the
lacedaemonian
ambassador
was
sent
out
of
the
territories
of
athens
because
he
came
from
an
enemy
who
had
no
pacific
intentions
the
senate
of
rome
said
that
they
could
receive
no
embassy
from
carthage
as
long
as
the
carthaginian
army
remained
in
italy
the
achaeans
refused
to
admit
the
ambassadors
of
perseus
who
were
secretly
meditating
war
against
the
romans
upon
the
same
grounds
justinian
rejected
an
embassy
from
totilas
and
the
same
was
done
by
the
goths
at
urbino
to
messengers
from
belisarius
polybius
relates
in
the
third
book
of
his
history
that
every
power
drove
away
the
ambassadors
of
the
cynethensians
as
they
were
so
infamous
a
people
we
have
an
instance
of
the
second
kind
where
the
objection
is
made
to
the
person
sent
on
an
embassy
in
the
case
of
theodore
who
was
called
the
atheist
and
whom
lysimachus
refused
to
receive
in
the
character
of
an
ambassador
sent
from
ptolemy
and
the
same
thing
has
frequently
happened
to
others
against
whom
peculiar
motives
of
aversion
have
existed
in
the
third
place
there
may
be
sufficient
grounds
for
refusing
to
admit
an
ambassador
if
the
object
of
his
mission
be
of
a
suspicious
kind
as
was
the
case
with
that
of
rhabshakeh
the
assyrian
whom
hezekiah
had
reason
to
suspect
of
coming
with
a
design
to
excite
his
people
to
rebellion
or
the
refusal
may
be
justified
where
it
is
not
consistent
with
the
dignity
or
circumstances
of
one
power
to
enter
into
any
treaty
or
intercourse
with
another
for
this
reason
the
romans
sent
a
declaration
to
the
aetolians
that
they
should
send
no
embassy
but
with
the
permission
of
their
general
and
perseus
was
not
allowed
to
send
one
to
rome
but
to
licinius
jugurtha
ambassadors
too
as
sallust
informs
us
were
ordered
to
leave
italy
within
the
space
of
ten
days
unless
they
came
with
offers
from
that
prince
to
surrender
himself
and
his
kingdom
there
may
often
be
the
best
reasons
for
a
sovereign
refusing
to
allow
of
a
resident
minister
at
his
court
a
practice
so
general
in
the
present
day
but
totally
unknown
to
the
ages
of
antiquity
iv
as
to
the
personal
exemption
of
ambassadors
from
arrest
constraint
or
violence
of
any
kind
it
is
a
subject
of
some
difficulty
to
determine
owing
to
the
varieties
of
opinion
entertained
by
the
most
celebrated
writers
on
the
question
in
the
consideration
of
this
matter
our
attention
is
directed
in
the
first
place
to
the
personal
privileges
and
exemptions
of
ambassadors
themselves
and
next
to
those
of
their
attendants
and
their
goods
with
respect
to
their
persons
some
writers
are
of
opinion
that
it
is
only
from
unjust
violence
and
illegal
constraint
that
the
law
of
nations
protects
ambassadors
for
they
imagine
that
their
privileges
are
to
be
explained
according
to
the
common
principles
of
the
law
of
nature
others
again
suppose
that
ambassadors
are
not
amenable
to
punishment
for
all
offences
but
only
for
such
as
amount
to
a
transgression
of
the
law
of
nations
the
principles
of
which
are
of
such
general
extent
as
to
include
the
law
of
nature
consequently
there
can
be
no
offences
for
which
an
ambassador
is
not
punishable
except
for
those
actions
that
are
made
such
by
the
positive
rules
of
municipal
or
civil
law
others
again
consider
these
public
representatives
of
states
and
crowned
heads
as
only
liable
to
punishment
for
offences
affecting
the
dignity
or
governments
of
the
sovereigns
to
whom
they
are
sent
while
on
the
other
hand
there
are
some
writers
who
maintain
that
for
any
state
to
punish
an
ambassador
for
any
crime
whatever
is
highly
dangerous
to
the
independence
of
foreign
powers
but
that
all
offenders
of
that
description
ought
to
be
left
to
the
laws
of
their
respective
countries
to
be
punished
or
not
according
to
their
deserts
upon
due
complaint
being
made
to
the
sovereigns
by
whom
they
were
sent
some
few
writers
indeed
in
laying
down
the
rule
to
be
observed
in
such
cases
have
decided
that
an
appeal
should
be
made
to
other
independent
and
disinterested
powers
which
may
be
considered
rather
as
a
matter
of
discretion
than
of
absolute
right
but
the
advocates
of
all
these
various
systems
have
come
to
no
definite
conclusion
in
support
of
their
favourite
opinions
for
this
is
a
right
which
can
not
like
the
law
of
nature
be
established
upon
unchangeable
rules
but
derives
all
its
efficacy
from
the
will
of
nations
nations
if
they
had
thought
proper
certainly
might
have
laid
down
absolute
rules
of
security
for
ambassadors
or
coupled
them
with
certain
exceptions
the
argument
is
supported
on
one
side
by
the
urgent
necessity
of
heinous
crimes
being
punished
and
on
the
other
the
utmost
latitude
of
exemption
is
favoured
on
account
of
the
utility
of
embassies
the
facility
of
sending
which
ought
to
be
encouraged
by
every
possible
privilege
and
security
to
settle
the
point
therefore
we
must
consider
how
far
nations
have
agreed
among
themselves
upon
these
principles
the
proofs
of
which
can
only
be
found
in
the
evidence
of
history
many
instances
may
be
produced
in
favour
of
both
opinions
and
in
cases
like
this
the
opinions
of
those
celebrated
for
their
judgment
and
knowledge
will
be
of
no
small
weight
but
in
some
cases
we
must
rest
upon
conjectures
on
this
subject
the
two
eminent
historians
livy
and
sallust
may
be
quoted
as
authorities
the
former
of
whom
in
mentioning
the
ambassadors
of
tarquin
who
had
been
guilty
of
fomenting
treasonable
conspiracies
at
rome
says
that
although
they
deserved
to
be
treated
as
enemies
for
their
guilty
conduct
yet
the
privilege
which
they
derived
from
the
law
of
nations
prevailed
over
every
other
consideration
here
we
see
that
the
rights
of
ambassadors
could
not
be
annulled
even
by
the
most
criminal
acts
of
hostility
but
the
observation
made
by
sallust
relates
rather
to
those
who
come
in
the
train
of
an
embassy
than
to
ambassadors
themselves
the
law
of
nations
surely
then
will
not
deny
the
same
privilege
to
a
principal
which
it
evidently
allows
to
those
who
form
but
a
subordinate
part
in
the
public
mission
the
historian
says
that
bomilcar
was
arraigned
and
tried
rather
upon
principles
of
equity
and
natural
justice
than
in
conformity
to
the
law
of
nations
as
he
belonged
to
the
train
of
jugurtha
who
had
come
to
rome
under
the
pledge
of
public
faith
equity
and
natural
justice
require
punishment
to
be
inflicted
on
all
offenders
whereas
the
law
of
nations
makes
an
exception
in
favour
of
ambassadors
and
those
who
have
the
public
faith
for
their
protection
wherefore
to
try
or
punish
ambassadors
is
contrary
to
the
law
of
nations
which
prohibits
many
things
that
are
permitted
by
the
law
of
nature
the
law
of
nations
thus
deviating
from
the
law
of
nature
gives
rise
to
those
interpretations
and
conjectures
which
reconcile
with
the
principles
of
justice
a
greater
extension
of
privileges
than
the
law
of
nature
strictly
allows
for
if
ambassadors
were
protected
against
nothing
more
than
violence
and
illegal
constraint
their
privileges
would
confer
no
extraordinary
advantage
besides
the
security
of
ambassadors
is
a
matter
of
much
greater
moment
to
the
public
welfare
than
the
punishment
of
offences
because
reparation
for
the
misconduct
of
an
ambassador
may
be
looked
for
from
the
sovereign
by
whom
he
is
sent
unless
that
sovereign
chuses
to
expose
himself
to
hostilities
by
approving
of
his
crimes
an
objection
to
such
privileges
is
made
by
some
who
assert
that
it
is
better
for
one
person
to
be
punished
than
for
whole
nations
to
be
involved
in
war
but
if
a
sovereign
has
secretly
given
his
sanction
to
the
misconduct
of
his
ambassador
his
apparent
intentions
to
punish
that
ambassador
will
not
deprive
the
injured
power
of
the
right
to
seek
redress
by
commencing
hostilities
on
the
other
hand
the
right
of
ambassadors
would
rest
upon
a
very
slippery
foundation
if
they
were
accountable
for
their
actions
to
any
one
but
their
own
sovereigns
for
as
the
interests
of
powers
sending
and
of
those
receiving
ambassadors
are
in
general
different
and
some
times
even
opposite
if
a
public
minister
were
obliged
to
consult
the
inclinations
of
both
there
would
be
no
part
of
his
conduct
to
which
they
might
not
impute
some
degree
of
blame
besides
although
some
points
are
so
clear
as
to
admit
of
no
doubt
yet
universal
danger
is
sufficient
to
establish
the
equity
and
utility
of
a
general
law
for
this
reason
it
is
natural
to
suppose
that
nations
have
agreed
in
the
case
of
ambassadors
to
dispense
with
that
obedience
which
every
one
by
general
custom
owes
to
the
laws
of
that
foreign
country
in
which
at
any
time
he
resides
the
character
which
they
sustain
is
not
that
of
ordinary
individuals
but
they
represent
the
majesty
of
the
sovereigns
by
whom
they
are
sent
whose
power
is
limited
to
no
local
jurisdiction
as
cicero
in
his
eighth
philippic
speaking
of
a
certain
ambassador
says
he
carried
with
him
the
majesty
of
the
senate
and
the
authority
of
the
state
from
hence
it
is
concluded
that
an
ambassador
is
not
bound
by
the
laws
of
the
country
where
he
resides
if
he
commit
an
offence
of
a
trivial
nature
it
may
either
be
suffered
to
pass
unnoticed
or
he
may
be
ordered
to
leave
the
country
polybius
relates
an
instance
of
an
ambassador
who
was
ordered
to
leave
rome
for
having
assisted
some
hostages
in
making
their
escape
hence
it
is
obvious
why
the
romans
inflicted
corporeal
punishment
upon
an
ambassador
of
tarentum
because
the
tarentines
were
at
that
time
their
own
subjects
by
right
of
conquest
if
a
crime
is
of
a
notorious
nature
affecting
the
government
an
ambassador
may
be
sent
home
and
his
sovereign
required
to
punish
or
deliver
him
up
as
we
read
of
the
gauls
having
done
to
the
fabians
but
as
we
have
before
occasionally
observed
all
human
laws
are
framed
upon
such
principles
as
in
cases
of
extreme
necessity
to
admit
of
equitable
relaxations
among
which
the
privileges
of
ambassadors
may
be
reckoned
but
these
extreme
cases
of
necessity
may
according
to
the
law
of
nations
as
will
be
seen
hereafter
in
discussing
the
effects
of
just
and
solemn
war
prevent
punishment
in
certain
cases
though
not
in
all
for
it
is
not
the
act
of
punishment
itself
which
is
objected
to
either
in
respect
to
time
or
manner
but
the
exemption
is
created
to
prevent
the
greater
public
evil
which
might
arise
from
the
punishment
of
the
offender
to
obviate
therefore
any
imminent
danger
if
no
other
proper
method
can
be
devised
ambassadors
may
be
detained
and
interrogated
thus
the
roman
consuls
seized
the
ambassadors
of
tarquin
previously
taking
care
to
secure
their
papers
to
prevent
the
evidence
which
they
might
afford
from
being
destroyed
but
if
an
ambassador
excites
and
heads
any
violent
insurrection
he
may
be
killed
not
by
way
of
punishment
but
upon
the
natural
principle
of
the
gauls
therefore
might
have
put
to
death
the
fabii
whom
livy
calls
violators
of
the
law
of
nature
mention
has
before
been
frequently
made
of
the
exemptions
by
which
ambassadors
are
protected
from
all
personal
constraint
and
violence
and
it
is
understood
that
all
powers
are
bound
by
a
tacit
agreement
as
it
were
from
the
time
of
admitting
an
ambassador
to
respect
these
exemptions
it
may
and
indeed
sometimes
does
happen
that
one
power
gives
notice
to
another
that
no
ambassador
will
be
received
and
if
one
is
sent
that
he
will
be
treated
as
an
enemy
a
declaration
to
this
effect
was
made
by
the
romans
to
the
aetolians
and
on
another
occasion
the
vejentian
ambassadors
were
ordered
to
leave
rome
with
a
menace
if
they
refused
to
comply
of
being
treated
in
the
same
manner
as
the
roman
ambassadors
had
been
treated
by
their
king
tolumnius
who
had
put
them
to
death
the
samnites
too
forbade
the
romans
to
go
to
any
council
in
samnium
under
pain
of
forfeiting
their
lives
or
at
least
their
personal
safety
the
above
law
does
not
bind
a
power
through
whose
territories
ambassadors
pass
without
leave
for
if
they
are
going
to
an
enemy
of
that
power
or
returning
from
him
or
are
engaged
in
any
hostile
design
they
may
lawfully
be
treated
as
enemies
which
was
done
by
the
athenians
in
the
case
of
the
messengers
passing
between
the
persians
and
spartans
and
by
the
illyrians
in
that
of
those
who
carried
on
the
intercourse
between
the
essians
and
romans
xenophon
maintains
that
in
certain
cases
they
may
be
made
prisoners
as
alexander
made
those
who
were
sent
from
thebes
and
lacedaemon
to
darius
and
the
romans
those
whom
philip
sent
to
hannibal
and
latius
those
of
the
volscians
for
to
treat
ambassadors
with
any
degree
of
rigour
except
upon
those
sufficient
grounds
would
be
deemed
not
only
a
breach
of
the
law
of
nations
but
a
personal
offence
against
the
sovereigns
to
whom
they
are
going
or
by
whom
they
are
sent
justin
informs
us
that
philip
ii
king
of
macedon
sent
an
ambassador
to
hannibal
with
credentials
empowering
him
to
make
an
alliance
and
that
when
this
ambassador
was
seized
and
carried
before
the
senate
of
rome
they
dismissed
him
without
farther
molestation
not
out
of
respect
to
the
king
but
to
prevent
a
doubtful
enemy
from
becoming
a
decided
one
vi
but
if
an
embassy
admitted
by
an
enemy
is
entitled
to
all
the
privileges
of
the
law
of
nations
much
more
so
is
one
admitted
by
a
power
unfriendly
but
not
engaged
in
actual
hostilities
diodorus
siculus
says
that
a
messenger
with
a
flag
of
truce
claims
all
the
security
of
peace
even
in
the
midst
of
war
the
lacedaemonians
who
had
murdered
the
heralds
of
the
persians
were
said
by
that
act
to
have
confounded
every
distinction
between
right
and
wrong
as
it
is
acknowledged
by
all
nations
for
legal
writers
lay
it
down
as
a
rule
that
to
offer
personal
violence
to
ambassadors
whose
characters
are
deemed
sacred
is
a
defiance
of
the
law
of
nations
and
tacitus
calls
the
privileges
we
are
now
discussing
the
rights
of
embassy
sanctified
by
the
law
of
nations
cicero
in
his
first
speech
against
verres
asks
if
ambassadors
ought
not
to
be
safe
in
the
midst
of
an
enemy
country
or
even
in
his
camp
innumerable
other
instances
of
this
kind
might
be
produced
from
the
highest
authorities
both
ancient
and
modern
and
it
is
with
reason
that
such
privileges
are
revered
for
in
the
midst
of
war
many
circumstances
arise
which
can
not
be
decided
but
through
ambassadors
and
it
is
the
only
channel
through
which
proposals
of
peace
can
be
made
and
confirmed
vii
it
is
frequently
made
a
subject
of
inquiry
whether
the
ambassador
of
a
sovereign
who
has
exercised
any
act
of
cruelty
or
rigour
will
be
subject
to
the
law
of
retaliation
history
furnishes
many
instances
in
which
punishment
has
been
inflicted
in
such
a
manner
but
history
is
sometimes
nothing
more
than
a
catalogue
of
actions
marked
with
injustice
and
ungovernable
fury
whereas
the
law
of
nations
by
its
privileges
designs
to
secure
the
dignity
not
only
of
sovereigns
themselves
but
also
that
of
the
ambassadors
whom
they
employ
consequently
there
is
a
tacit
agreement
understood
to
be
made
with
the
latter
that
he
shall
be
exempt
not
only
from
any
ill
treatment
that
may
affect
the
principal
but
from
such
likewise
as
may
affect
himself
so
that
it
was
a
magnanimous
answer
conformable
to
the
law
of
nations
which
scipio
made
when
the
roman
ambassadors
had
been
by
the
carthaginians
and
the
carthaginian
ambassadors
were
brought
before
him
upon
his
being
asked
in
what
manner
they
should
be
treated
he
replied
not
as
the
roman
ambassadors
had
been
by
the
carthaginians
livy
adds
that
he
said
he
would
do
nothing
unbecoming
the
character
and
laws
of
the
roman
people
valerius
maximus
assigns
the
same
language
to
the
consuls
on
an
occasion
similar
but
prior
to
this
in
addressing
hanno
they
said
the
pledge
of
faith
which
our
state
has
given
releases
you
from
any
such
fear
for
even
at
that
time
cornelius
asina
in
violation
of
his
public
character
had
been
arrested
and
thrown
into
prison
by
the
carthaginians
viii
the
train
too
of
an
ambassador
and
all
the
plate
belonging
to
him
are
entitled
to
a
peculiar
kind
of
protection
which
gave
rise
to
the
passage
in
the
ancient
song
of
the
heralds
o
sovereign
do
you
make
me
a
royal
messenger
from
the
roman
citizens
and
do
you
confer
the
same
privileges
on
my
train
and
every
thing
which
belongs
to
me
and
by
the
julian
law
an
injury
affecting
not
only
ambassadors
but
even
their
attendants
is
pronounced
to
be
a
violation
of
public
right
but
these
privileges
of
attendants
are
only
granted
so
far
as
an
ambassador
himself
may
think
proper
so
that
if
any
of
them
has
committed
an
offence
he
must
be
required
to
deliver
up
the
offender
to
punishment
he
must
be
required
to
give
him
up
because
no
violence
in
taking
an
offender
of
that
description
must
be
used
when
the
achaeans
had
arrested
some
lacedaemonians
who
were
along
with
the
roman
ambassadors
the
romans
raised
a
great
outcry
against
the
act
as
a
violation
of
the
law
of
nations
sallust
opinion
in
the
case
of
bomilcar
has
already
been
referred
to
but
should
the
ambassador
refuse
to
give
up
such
offender
redress
must
be
sought
in
the
same
manner
as
would
be
done
with
respect
to
the
ambassador
himself
as
to
his
authority
over
his
household
and
the
asylum
which
he
may
afford
in
his
house
to
fugitives
these
depend
upon
the
agreement
made
with
the
power
to
whom
he
is
sent
and
do
not
come
within
the
decision
of
the
law
of
nations
ix
neither
can
the
moveable
property
of
an
ambassador
nor
any
thing
which
is
reckoned
a
personal
appendage
be
seized
for
the
discharge
of
a
debt
either
by
process
of
law
or
even
by
royal
authority
for
to
give
him
full
security
not
only
his
person
but
every
thing
belonging
to
him
must
be
protected
from
all
compulsion
if
an
ambassador
then
has
contracted
a
debt
and
as
is
usual
has
no
possession
in
the
country
where
he
resides
first
of
all
courteous
application
must
be
made
to
himself
and
in
case
of
his
refusal
to
his
sovereign
but
if
both
these
methods
of
redress
fail
recourse
must
be
had
to
those
means
of
recovery
which
are
used
against
debtors
residing
out
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
country
x
nor
is
there
as
some
think
any
reason
to
fear
that
if
such
extensive
privileges
were
established
no
one
would
be
found
willing
to
enter
into
any
contract
with
an
ambassador
or
to
furnish
him
with
necessary
articles
for
the
same
rule
will
hold
good
in
the
case
of
ambassadors
as
in
that
of
kings
as
sovereigns
who
for
the
best
of
reasons
are
placed
above
the
reach
of
legal
compulsion
find
no
difficulty
in
obtaining
credit
xi
the
importance
of
such
exemptions
may
be
easily
inferred
from
the
innumerable
instances
in
which
both
sacred
and
profane
history
abound
of
wars
undertaken
on
account
of
the
of
ambassadors
the
war
which
david
made
against
the
ammonites
on
that
account
affords
us
a
memorable
instance
from
holy
writ
and
as
a
profane
writer
cicero
may
be
cited
who
deemed
it
the
most
justifiable
ground
of
the

are
common
to
all
mankind

agreeable
to
natural
reason
we
find
it
some
where
said
by
aelian
that
our
common
nature
calls
upon
us
to
cover
the
dead
and
some
writer
in

that

are
reduced

informs
us
in

of

that
when
tiberius
made
a
general
massacre
of
all
who
had
been
connected
with
sejanus
and
that
he
forbad
them
the
rites
of
burial
every
one
was
struck
with
horror
to
see
the
last
offices
of
humanity
refused
offices
which
lysias
the
orator
calls
the
common
hopes
of
our
nature
as
the
ancients
measured
the
moral
character
of
every
people
by
their
observance
or
neglect
of
these
rights
in
order
to
give
them
a
greater
appearance
of
sanctity
they
ascribed
their
origin
to
the
authority
and
institutions
of
their
gods
so
that
in
every
part
of
their
writings
we
meet
with
frequent
mention
of
the
rights
of
ambassadors
and
the
rights
of
burial
as
founded
upon
divine
appointment
in
the
tragedy
of
the
suppliants
euripides
calls
it
the
law
of
the
gods
and
in
the
antigone
of
sophocles
the
heroine
makes
the
following
reply
to
creon
who
had
forbidden
any
one
under
pain
of
death
to
give
the
rites
of
burial
to
polynices
a
prohibition
like
this
was
not
revealed
by
the
supreme
will
nor
by
that
justice
which
has
established
those
laws
of
respect
for
the
dead
nor
did
i
think
that
you
could
command
mortals
to
transgress
the
unwritten
and
inviolable
laws
of
god
they
were
not
established
nor
yesterday
but
from
all
eternity
and
will
for
ever
be
in
force
their
sources
are
unknown
am
i
through
fear
of
a
mortal
and
by
obeying
his
unjust
commands
to
incur
the
wrath
of
heaven
the
authority
of
isocrates
and
of
herodotus
and
that
of
xenophon
in
the
sixth
book
of
his
grecian
history
may
be
appealed
to
in
support
of
the
honours
that
have
at
all
times
been
paid
to
the
dead
in
short
these
offices
of
humanity
are
recommended
by
the
conspiring
testimony
of
the
orators
historians
poets
philosophers
and
divines
of
all
ages
who
have
dignified
them
with
the
names
of
the
most
splendid
virtues
ii
there
seems
to
be
no
general
agreement
of
opinion
upon
the
origin
of
funeral
rites
and
the
variety
of
ways
in
which
they
were
performed
the
egyptians
embalmed
and
most
of
the
greeks
burned
the
bodies
of
the
dead
before
they
committed
them
to
the
grave
cicero
in
the
chapter
of
his
second
book
on
laws
speaks
of
the
interment
alone
which
is
now
in
use
as
the
most
ancient
method
and
that
which
is
most
congenial
to
nature
and
in
this
he
is
followed
by
pliny
some
think
that
men
paid
it
as
a
voluntary
debt
of
nature
which
they
knew
that
at
any
rate
they
would
be
obliged
to
discharge
for
the
divine
sentence
that
the
body
should
return
to
the
dust
from
which
it
was
taken
was
not
passed
upon
adam
only
but
as
we
find
it
acknowledged
by
the
writings
of
greece
and
rome
extended
to
the
whole
human
race
cicero
from
the
hypsipyle
of
euripides
says
earth
must
be
returned
to
earth
and
in
the
twelfth
chapter
of
ecclesiastes
there
is
a
passage
to
the
same
purport
that
the
dust
shall
return
to
the
earth
as
it
was
but
the
spirit
to
god
who
gave
it
euripides
has
enlarged
on
this
subject
in
the
character
of
theseus
in
his
suppliants
suffer
the
dead
to
be
laid
in
the
lap
of
the
earth
for
every
thing
returns
to
its
original
state
the
spirit
to
heaven
and
the
body
to
the
earth
neither
of
them
is
given
in
plenary
possession
but
only
for
a
short
use
the
earth
soon
demands
back
the
bodies
to
which
she
had
given
birth
and
nourishment
in
the
same
manner
lucretius
calls
the
earth
a
prolific
parent
and
a
common
grave
pliny
also
describes
the
earth
as
receiving
us
at
our
birth
cherishing
our
growth
supporting
us
to
the
very
last
and
when
all
the
other
parts
of
nature
have
forsaken
us
taking
us
to
her
maternal
bosom
and
covering
us
with
a
mantle
there
are
some
who
think
that
the
custom
of
burial
was
bequeathed
to
us
by
our
first
parents
as
a
testamentary
hope
of
a
resurrection
for
we
are
instructed
by
democritus
to
believe
that
our
bodies
are
preserved
in
the
earth
under
the
promise
of
a
restoration
to
life
and
christians
in
particular
have
frequently
ascribed
the
custom
of
decent
burial
to
the
same
hope
prudentius
a
christian
poet
says
what
can
be
the
meaning
of
hallowed
rocks
or
splendid
monuments
except
that
they
are
the
depositories
of
bodies
consigned
not
to
death
but
to
a
temporary
sleep
but
the
most
obvious
explanation
is
to
be
found
in
the
dignity
of
man
who
surpassing
other
creatures
it
would
be
a
shame
if
his
body
were
left
to
be
devoured
by
beasts
of
prey
it
is
an
act
of
compassion
then
said
quintilian
to
preserve
the
bodies
of
men
from
ravages
of
birds
and
beasts
for
to
be
tore
by
wild
beasts
as
cicero
observes
in
his
first
book
on
invention
is
to
be
robbed
of
those
honours
in
death
which
are
due
to
our
common
nature
and
the
roman
poet
makes
a
lamentation
over
one
of
his
heroes
that
he
had
no
pious
mother
to
lay
his
body
in
the
grave
but
he
would
be
left
a
prey
to
birds
or
thrown
into
the
river
as
food
for
fishes
aen
x
but
to
speak
from
still
higher
authority
god
by
the
mouth
of
his
prophets
threatens
the
wicked
that
they
shall
have
burial
like
that
of
the
brutes
and
that
the
dogs
shall
lick
their
blood
such
a
menace
denounced
against
the
wicked
as
a
punishment
shews
that
it
is
an
indignity
done
to
our
nature
when
in
the
words
of
lactantius
the
image
of
god
is
cast
out
to
the
insults
of
beasts
of
prey
but
in
such
indignity
if
there
was
even
nothing
repugnant
to
the
feelings
of
men
still
the
nakedness
and
infirmities
of
our
perishable
nature
should
not
be
exposed
to
the
eye
of
day
consequently
the
rights
of
burial
the
discharge
of
which
forms
one
of
the
offices
of
humanity
can
not
be
denied
even
to
enemies
whom
a
state
of
warfare
has
not
deprived
of
the
rights
and
nature
of
men
for
as
virgil
observes
all
animosity
against
the
vanquished
and
the
dead
must
cease
aen
xi
because
they
have
suffered
the
last
of
evils
that
can
be
inflicted
we
have
been
at
war
i
grant
but
our
hatred
has
fallen
and
all
our
enmity
is
buried
in
the
grave
and
optatus
milevitanus
assigns
the
same
reason
for
reconciliation
if
there
have
been
struggles
among
the
living
your
hatred
surely
must
be
satisfied
with
the
death
of
an
adversary
for
the
tongue
of
strife
is
now
silenced
iii
upon
the
principles
advanced
above
it
is
agreed
by
all
that
public
enemies
are
entitled
to
burial
appian
calls
it
the
common
right
of
war
with
which
tacitus
says
no
enemy
will
refuse
to
comply
and
the
rules
respecting
this
are
according
to
dio
chrysostom
observed
even
while
the
utmost
rage
of
war
still
continues
for
the
hand
of
death
the
writer
just
quoted
has
destroyed
all
enmity
towards
the
fallen
and
protected
their
bodies
from
all
insult
examples
to
this
purpose
may
be
found
in
various
parts
of
history
alexander
ordered
those
of
the
enemy
that
were
killed
at
the
battle
of
issus
to
be
honoured
with
the
rites
of
burial
and
hannibal
did
the
same
to
caius
flaminius
publius
aemilius
tiberius
gracchus
and
marcellus
the
roman
generals
so
that
you
would
suppose
says
silius
italicus
he
had
been
paying
these
honours
to
a
carthaginian
general
the
romans
treated
hanno
and
pompey
mithridates
in
the
same
manner
if
it
were
necessary
to
quote
more
instances
the
conduct
of
demetrius
on
many
occasions
and
that
of
antony
to
king
archelaus
might
be
named
when
the
greeks
were
at
war
with
the
persians
in
one
part
of
their
military
oath
they
swore
to
bury
all
the
dead
belonging
to
the
allies
and
when
they
were
victorious
to
bury
even
the
barbarians
after
a
battle
it
was
usual
for
both
sides
to
obtain
leave
to
bury
the
dead
pausanias
in
his
account
of
the
athenian
affairs
mentions
the
practice
of
the
athenians
who
buried
the
medes
regarding
it
as
an
act
of
piety
due
to
all
men
we
find
from
the
jewish
writers
that
for
the
same
reason
their
high
priests
who
were
forbidden
to
come
near
a
dead
body
if
they
found
one
were
obliged
to
bury
it
but
christians
deemed
burial
an
act
of
such
importance
that
they
would
allow
their
to
be
melted
down
and
sold
to
defray
the
expences
as
they
would
have
done
to
maintain
the
poor
or
to
redeem
captives
there
are
some
few
instances
to
the
contrary
but
they
are
reprobated
by
the
universal
feelings
of
mankind
and
such
cruelty
deprecated
in
the
most
solemn
terms
claudian
calls
it
a
bloody
deed
to
plunder
the
dead
and
still
more
so
to
refuse
them
the
covering
of
a
little
sand
iv
respecting
those
who
have
been
guilty
of
atrocious
crimes
there
is
reason
to
entertain
some
doubt
whether
the
right
of
burial
is
due
to
them
the
divine
law
indeed
that
was
given
to
the
hebrews
and
which
is
fraught
with
every
precept
of
virtue
and
humanity
ordered
those
who
were
crucified
which
was
the
most
ignominious
kind
of
punishment
that
could
be
inflicted
to
be
buried
on
the
same
day
owing
to
this
law
as
josephus
observes
the
jews
paid
such
regard
to
burial
that
the
bodies
of
those
who
were
executed
publicly
as
criminals
were
taken
away
before
and
committed
to
the
ground
and
other
jewish
writers
are
of
opinion
that
this
was
intended
as
a
degree
of
reverence
to
the
divine
image
after
which
man
was
formed
to
allow
burial
to
criminals
must
have
been
the
practice
in
the
time
of
homer
for
we
are
told
in
the
third
book
of
the
odyssey
that
ægisthus
who
had
added
the
crime
of
murder
to
that
of
adultery
was
honoured
with
funeral
ceremonies
by
orestes
the
son
of
the
murdered
king
it
was
the
custom
with
the
romans
as
may
be
seen
from
ulpian
never
to
refuse
giving
the
bodies
of
criminals
to
their
relatives
to
bury
the
emperors
diocletian
and
maximian
in
a
rescript
declared
that
they
did
not
refuse
to
deliver
up
for
burial
those
who
had
deservedly
been
put
to
death
for
their
crimes
in
reading
the
history
of
civil
wars
we
find
more
frequent
instances
of
indignities
offered
to
the
dead
than
in
the
accounts
of
any
foreign
wars
in
some
cases
the
bodies
of
executed
criminals
are
exposed
to
public
view
and
hung
in
chains
a
custom
the
propriety
of
which
is
very
much
doubted
both
by
theological
and
political
writers
so
far
from
approving
of
the
practice
we
find
such
writers
bestowing
praises
upon
many
who
had
ordered
funeral
honours
to
be
paid
to
those
who
would
not
themselves
have
allowed
the
same
to
others
an
action
of
this
kind
was
done
by
pausanias
the
lacedaemonian
who
being
urged
by
the
people
of
aegina
to
retaliate
upon
the
persians
for
their
treatment
of
leonidas
rejected
the
advice
as
unbecoming
his
own
character
and
the
grecian
name
the
pharisees
allowed
burial
even
to
king
jannaeus
alexander
who
had
treated
the
dead
bodies
of
their
countrymen
with
every
kind
of
insult
though
indeed
on
certain
occasions
god
may
have
punished
some
offenders
with
the
loss
of
such
a
right
he
did
so
by
virtue
of
his
own
prerogative
which
places
him
above
the
restrictions
of
all
law
and
when
david
exposed
the
head
of
goliah
it
was
done
to
one
who
was
an
alien
and
a
despiser
of
god
and
might
be
justified
by
that
law
which
confined
the
name
and
privileges
of
neighbour
to
the
hebrews
there
is
one
thing
not
improper
to
be
observed
that
the
rule
prevailing
among
the
hebrews
with
respect
to
burying
the
dead
contained
an
exception
as
we
are
informed
by
josephus
excluding
those
who
had
committed
suicide
nor
is
it
surprising
that
a
mark
of
ignominy
should
be
affixed
to
those
on
whom
death
itself
can
not
be
inflicted
as
a
punishment
aristotle
in
the
fifth
book
of
his
ethics
speaks
of
the
infamy
universally
attached
to
suicide
nor
is
the
observation
at
all
weakened
by
the
opinions
of
some
of
the
grecian
poets
that
as
the
dead
are
void
of
all
perception
they
can
not
be
affected
either
by
loss
or
shame
for
it
is
a
sufficient
reason
to
justify
the
practice
if
the
living
can
be
deterred
from
committing
actions
for
which
they
see
a
mark
of
infamy
set
upon
the
dead
in
opposition
to
the
stoics
and
others
who
admitted
the
dread
of
servitude
sickness
or
any
other
calamity
or
even
the
ambitious
love
of
glory
to
be
a
just
cause
of
voluntary
death
in
opposition
to
them
the
platonists
justly
maintain
that
the
soul
must
be
retained
in
the
custody
of
the
body
from
which
it
can
not
be
released
but
at
the
command
of
him
who
gave
it
on
this
subject
there
are
many
fine
thoughts
in
plotinus
olympiodorus
and
macrobius
on
the
dream
of
scipio
brutus
following
the
opinions
of
the
platonists
had
formerly
condemned
the
death
of
cato
whom
he
himself
afterwards
imitated
he
considered
it
as
an
act
of
impiety
for
any
one
to
withdraw
himself
from
his
allegiance
to
the
supreme
being
and
to
shrink
from
evils
which
he
ought
to
bear
with
fortitude
and
megasthenes
as
may
be
seen
in
strabo
book
xv
remarked
the
disapprobation
which
the
indian
sages
expressed
of
the
conduct
of
calanus
for
it
was
by
no
means
agreeable
to
their
tenets
that
any
one
through
impatience
should
quit
his
post
in
life
in
the
fifth
book
of
quintus
curtius
there
is
an
expression
of
king
darius
to
this
effect
that
he
had
rather
die
by
guilty
hand
than
by
his
own
in
the
same
manner
the
hebrews
call
death
a
release
or
dismission
as
may
be
seen
not
only
in
the
gospel
of
luke
ch
ii

in
the
greek
version
of
the
old
testament

there
are
certain
other
rights
too
which
owe
their
origin
to
the
voluntary
law
of
nations
such
as
the
right
of
possession
from
length
of

the
right
of
succession
to
any
one
who
dies
intestate
and
the
right
resulting
from
contracts
though
of
an
unequal
kind
for
though
all
these
rights
in
some
measure
spring
from
the
law
of

yet
they
derive
their
confirmation
from
human
law

it
be
in
opposition
to
the
uncertainty
of
conjecture
or
to
certain
other
exceptions
suggested

in

were
explained
it
was
considered
in
a
light
either
as
a
reparation
for
injuries
or
as
a
punishment
the
first
of
these
points
having
been
already
cleared
up
the
latter
which
relates
to
punishments
remains
to
be
discussed
and
it
will
require
a
more
ample
investigation
for
the
origin
and
nature
of
punishment
not
being
perfectly
understood
has
given
rise
to
many
errors
punishment
taken
in
its
most
general
meaning
signifies
the
pain
of
suffering
which
is
inflicted
for
evil
actions
for
although
labour
may
some
times
be
imposed
instead
of
punishment
still
it
is
considered
in
that
case
as
a
hardship
and
a
grievous
burden
and
may
therefore
properly
be
classed
with
sufferings
but
the
inconveniences
which
men
are
some
times
exposed
to
by
being
excluded
from
the
intercourse
of
society
and
the
offices
of
life
owing
to
infectious
disorders
or
other
similar
causes
which
was
the
case
with
the
jews
on
account
of
many
legal
impurities
these
temporary
privations
are
not
to
be
strictly
taken
for
punishments
though
from
their
resemblance
to
each
other
they
are
often
by
an
abuse
of
terms
confounded
but
among
the
dictates
laid
down
by
nature
as
lawful
and
just
and
which
the
ancient
philosophers
call
the
law
of
rhadamanthus
the
following
maxim
may
be
placed
that
it
is
right
for
every
one
to
suffer
evil
proportioned
to
that
which
he
has
done
which
gave
occasion
to
plutarch
in
his
book
on
exile
to
say
that
justice
is
an
attribute
of
god
avenging
all
transgressions
of
the
divine
law
and
we
apply
it
as
the
rule
and
measure
of
our
dealings
with
each
other
for
though
separated
by
the
arbitrary
or
geographical
bounds
of
territory
the
eye
of
nature
looks
upon
all
as
fellow
subjects
of
one
great
empire
hierocles
gives
a
fine
character
of
justice
calling
it
the
healing
remedy
of
all
mischief
lactantius
in
speaking
of
the
divine
wrath
calls
it
no
inconsiderable
mistake
in
those
who
degrade
human
or
divine
punishment
with
the
name
of
cruelty
or
rigour
imagining
that
some
degree
of
blame
must
always
attach
to
the
punishment
of
the
guilty
what
has
been
said
of
the
inseparable
connection
of
a
penalty
with
every
offense
is
similar
to
the
remark
of
augustin
that
to
make
a
punishment
just
it
must
be
inflicted
for
some
crime
he
applies
the
expression
to
explain
the
divine
justice
where
through
human
ignorance
the
offence
is
often
undiscoverable
though
the
judgment
may
be
seen
ii
there
are
diversities
of
opinion
whether
punishment
comes
under
the
rank
of
attributive
or
that
of
strict
justice
some
refer
it
to
justice
of
the
attributive
kind
because
offences
are
punished
more
or
less
in
proportion
to
their
consequences
and
because
the
punishment
is
inflicted
by
the
whole
community
as
it
were
upon
an
individual
it
is
undoubtedly
one
of
the
first
principles
of
justice
to
establish
an
equality
between
the
penalty
and
the
offence
for
it
is
the
business
of
reason
says
horace
in
one
of
his
satires
to
apply
a
rule
and
measure
by
which
the
penalty
may
be
framed
upon
a
scale
with
the
offence
and
in
another
place
he
observes
that
it
would
be
contrary
to
all
reason
to
punish
with
the
rack
a
slave
who
deserved
nothing
more
than
the
whip
i
sat
iii
and
the
divine
law
as
may
be
seen
from
the
xxv
chapter
of
deuteronomy
rests
upon
the
same
principle
there
is
one
sense
in
which
all
punishment
may
be
said
to
be
a
matter
of
strict
justice
thus
when
we
say
that
punishment
is
due
to
any
one
we
mean
nothing
more
than
that
it
is
right
he
should
be
punished
nor
can
any
one
inflict
this
punishment
but
the
person
who
has
a
right
to
do
so
now
in
the
eye
of
the
law
every
penalty
is
considered
as
a
debt
arising
out
of
a
crime
and
which
the
offender
is
bound
to
pay
to
the
aggrieved
party
and
in
this
there
is
something
approaching
to
the
nature
of
contracts
for
as
a
seller
though
no
express
stipulation
be
made
is
understood
to
have
bound
himself
by
all
the
usual
and
necessary
conditions
of
a
sale
so
punishment
being
a
natural
consequence
of
crime
every
heinous
offender
appears
to
have
voluntarily
incurred
the
penalties
of
law
in
this
sense
some
of
the
emperors
pronounced
sentence
upon
malefactors
in
the
following
manner
you
have
brought
this
punishment
upon
yourselves
indeed
every
wicked
action
done
by
design
was
considered
as
a
voluntary
contract
to
submit
to
punishment
for
as
michael
the
ephesian
observes
on
the
fifth
book
of
aristotle
nicomachean
ethics
the
ancients
gave
the
name
of
contract
not
only
to
the
voluntary
agreements
which
men
made
with
each
other
but
to
the
obligations
arising
from
the
sentence
of
the
law
iii
but
to
whom
the
right
of
punishing
properly
belongs
is
a
matter
not
determined
by
the
law
of
nature
for
though
reason
may
point
out
the
necessity
of
punishing
the
guilty
it
does
not
specify
the
person
to
whom
the
execution
of
it
is
to
be
committed
natural
reason
indeed
does
so
far
point
out
the
person
that
it
is
deemed
most
suitable
for
a
superior
only
to
be
invested
with
the
power
of
inflicting
punishment
yet
this
demonstration
does
not
amount
to
an
absolute
necessity
unless
the
word
superior
be
taken
in
a
sense
implying
that
the
commission
of
a
crime
makes
the
offender
inferior
to
every
one
of
his
own
species
by
his
having
degraded
himself
from
the
rank
of
men
to
that
of
the
brutes
which
are
in
subjection
to
man
a
doctrine
which
some
theologists
have
maintained
philosophers
too
agreed
in
this
for
democritus
supposed
that
power
naturally
belonged
to
superior
merit
and
aristotle
was
of
opinion
that
both
in
the
productions
of
nature
and
art
the
inferior
were
provided
for
the
use
of
the
superior
parts
from
this
opinion
there
arises
a
necessary
consequence
that
in
a
case
where
there
are
equal
degrees
of
guilt
in
two
parties
the
right
of
punishment
belongs
to
neither
in
conformity
to
which
our
saviour
in
the
case
of
the
woman
taken
in
adultery
pronounced
that
whoever
of
the
accusers
was
without
sin
meaning
sins
of
equal
enormity
should
cast
the
first
stone
john
viii
he
said
so
for
this
reason
because
in
that
age
the
manners
of
the
jews
were
so
corrupt
that
under
a
great
parade
of
sanctity
the
most
enormous
vices
and
the
most
wicked
dispositions
were
concealed
a
character
of
the
times
which
the
apostle
has
painted
in
the
most
glowing
colours
and
which
he
closes
with
a
reproof
similar
to
what
his
divine
master
had
given
therefore
thou
art
inexcusable
o
man
whosoever
thou
art
that
judgest
for
wherein
thou
judgest
another
thou
condemnest
thyself
for
thou
that
judgest
doest
the
same
things
rom
ii
applicable
to
which
there
is
a
remark
of
seneca
that
no
sentence
which
is
passed
by
a
guilty
person
can
have
any
weight
and
in
another
place
the
same
writer
observes
that
if
we
look
into
ourselves
and
consider
whether
we
have
been
guilty
of
the
offences
we
are
going
to
condemn
we
shall
be
more
moderate
in
our
judgments
iv
another
part
of
our
inquiry
respects
the
end
proposed
by
punishment
for
by
what
has
hitherto
been
said
it
was
only
meant
to
shew
that
in
punishing
the
guilty
no
injury
is
done
to
them
still
the
absolute
necessity
of
punishment
does
not
follow
from
thence
for
the
pardon
of
the
guilty
on
many
occasions
has
been
considered
as
the
most
beauteous
feature
in
the
divine
and
human
character
plato
is
celebrated
for
his
saying
that
justice
does
not
inflict
punishment
for
the
evils
that
are
done
and
can
not
be
retrieved
but
to
prevent
the
same
from
being
done
for
the
time
to
come
from
thucydides
we
find
that
diodorus
in
addressing
the
athenians
on
the
conduct
of
the
mitylenaeans
advises
them
to
forbear
punishing
their
avowed
injustice
unless
it
was
probable
that
the
punishment
would
be
attended
with
some
good
effect
these
maxims
may
be
true
with
regard
to
human
punishments
for
one
man
being
so
nearly
allied
to
another
by
blood
no
degree
of
suffering
should
be
inflicted
but
for
some
consequent
good
but
the
case
is
different
with
respect
to
god
to
whom
plato
injudiciously
applies
the
above
sentiments
for
though
the
divine
counsels
will
undoubtedly
have
the
good
of
men
in
view
as
the
end
of
all
punishment
yet
the
bare
reformation
of
the
offender
can
not
be
the
sole
object
since
the
divine
justice
though
tempered
with
mercy
must
adhere
to
the
truth
of
the
revealed
word
which
threatens
the
wicked
with
punishment
or
destruction
the
honour
therefore
of
god
as
well
as
the
example
held
up
to
men
will
be
a
consequence
resulting
from
his
punishment
of
the
wicked
a
dramatic
writer
has
said
that
the
pain
of
an
enemy
is
a
healing
remedy
to
a
wounded
spirit
in
which
he
agrees
with
cicero
and
plutarch
in
the
opinion
of
the
former
pain
is
mitigated
by
the
punishment
of
an
adversary
and
in
that
of
the
latter
satisfaction
is
a
sweet
medicine
to
a
troubled
mind
but
a
disposition
like
this
when
stripped
of
all
disguise
and
false
colouring
will
be
found
by
no
means
suitable
to
the
reasonable
soul
of
man
whose
office
it
is
to
regulate
and
controul
the
affections
nor
will
that
disposition
receive
any
sanction
from
the
law
of
nature
who
in
all
her
dictates
inclines
to
unite
men
in
society
by
good
will
rather
than
to
separate
them
by
cherishing
animosity
for
it
is
laid
down
by
reason
as
a
leading
axiom
in
her
code
of
laws
that
no
man
shall
do
any
thing
which
may
hurt
another
unless
it
be
for
the
purpose
of
some
evident
and
essential
good
but
the
pain
of
an
enemy
considered
solely
of
such
is
no
benefit
to
us
but
a
false
and
imaginary
one
like
that
derived
from
superfluous
riches
or
things
of
the
same
kind
in
this
acceptation
revenge
is
condemned
both
by
christian
teachers
and
heathen
philosophers
in
this
respect
the
language
of
seneca
approaches
very
near
to
the
perfection
of
christian
morals
he
calls
revenge
in
its
usual
and
proper
acceptation
a
term
of
inhumanity
differing
from
injury
only
in
degree
for
retaliation
of
pain
can
be
considered
as
nothing
better
than
excusable
sin
juvenal
after
describing
the
different
tempers
over
which
revenge
exercises
the
most
powerful
dominion
and
shewing
the
amiable
characters
over
which
it
has
no
influence
concludes
it
to
be
the
pleasure
of
a
little
and
infirm
mind
from
the
preceding
arguments
it
is
plain
that
punishment
can
not
justly
be
inflicted
from
a
spirit
of
revenge
we
proceed
therefore
to
consider
the
advantages
attending
its
just
infliction
vi
this
seems
the
most
proper
place
for
reviewing
those
distinctions
in
the
motives
of
punishment
which
have
been
used
by
plato
in
his
gorgias
and
by
taurus
the
philosopher
in
a
passage
quoted
by
gellius
in
the
fourteenth
chapter
of
his
fifth
book
these
distinctions
seem
to
result
naturally
from
the
end
of
all
punishment
plato
indeed
considers
the
amendment
of
the
offender
and
the
example
given
to
others
as
the
two
principal
motives
but
taurus
has
added
a
third
which
he
calls
satisfaction
and
which
is
defined
by
clemens
alexandrinus
to
be
repayment
of
evil
contributing
to
the
benefit
of
both
the
aggrieved
and
avenging
party
aristotle
passing
over
example
as
a
motive
confines
the
object
of
punishment
to
the
amendment
or
correction
of
the
offender
but
plutarch
has
not
made
the
same
omission
for
he
has
said
that
where
immediate
punishment
follows
the
execution
of
a
heinous
crime
it
both
operates
to
deter
others
from
committing
the
same
crime
and
administers
some
degree
of
consolation
to
the
injured
and
suffering
person
and
this
is
what
aristotle
calls
commutative
justice
but
these
matters
require
a
more
minute
inquiry
we
may
observe
therefore
that
there
is
nothing
contrary
either
to
human
or
divine
law
in
punishments
which
have
the
good
of
the
offender
or
that
of
the
injured
party
or
of
any
persons
whatsoever
in
view
the
three
proper
ends
are
obtained
by
that
kind
of
punishment
which
some
philosophers
have
called
correction
some
chastisement
and
others
admonition
paulus
the
lawyer
has
given
it
the
name
of
correction
plato
styles
it
a
lesson
of
instruction
and
plutarch
a
medicine
of
the
soul
reforming
and
healing
the
sufferer
while
it
operates
as
a
painful
remedy
for
as
all
deliberate
acts
by
frequent
repetition
produce
a
propensity
which
ripens
into
habit
the
best
method
of
reforming
vices
in
their
earliest
stage
is
to
deprive
them
of
their
sweet
savour
by
an
infusion
of
subsequent
pain
it
is
an
opinion
of
the
platonists
repeated
by
apuleius
that
impunity
and
the
delay
of
reproof
are
more
severe
and
pernicious
to
an
offender
than
any
punishment
whatsoever
and
in
the
words
of
tacitus
violent
disorders
must
be
encountered
with
remedies
proportionably
strong
vii
the
power
of
inflicting
the
punishment
subservient
to
this
end
is
allowed
by
the
law
of
nature
to
any
one
of
competent
judgment
and
not
implicated
in
similar
or
equal
offences
this
is
evident
as
far
as
verbal
reproof
goes
from
the
maxim
of
plautus
that
to
bestow
merited
reproof
upon
a
friend
is
useful
upon
certain
occasions
though
by
no
means
a
grateful
office
but
in
all
kinds
of
constraint
and
compulsion
the
difference
made
between
the
persons
who
are
allowed
and
who
are
not
allowed
to
exercise
it
is
no
appointment
of
natural
law
but
one
of
the
positive
institutions
of
the
civil
law
for
no
such
natural
distinction
could
be
made
any
farther
than
that
reason
would
intrust
parents
with
the
peculiar
use
of
such
an
authority
in
consideration
of
their
affection
but
laws
in
order
to
avoid
animosities
have
with
respect
to
the
authority
of
punishing
passed
over
the
common
kindred
subsisting
among
mankind
and
confined
it
to
the
nearest
degrees
of
relation
as
may
be
seen
in
many
records
and
particularly
in
the
code
of
justinian
under
the
title
of
the
power
of
relatives
to
correct
in
order
to
reform
offenders
and
cyrus
in
the
book
and
viii
chapter
of
xenophon
history
of
the
expedition
addresses
the
soldiers
to
the
following
purport
if
i
punish
any
one
for
his
good
i
am
willing
to
submit
to
justice
but
would
it
not
be
equally
reasonable
that
parents
and
masters
should
submit
to
justice
for
having
corrected
children
or
the
surgeon
be
responsible
for
having
used
the
where
the
patient
case
required
it
but
this
kind
of
corrective
punishment
does
not
extend
to
death
which
can
not
be
considered
as
a
benefit
in
itself
except
indirectly
and
by
way
of
reduction
as
it
is
called
by
logicians
who
in
order
to
confirm
negatives
reduce
them
to
things
of
an
opposite
kind
thus
in
mark
xiv
when
our
saviour
says
that
it
were
better
for
some
they
had
never
been
born
so
for
incurable
dispositions
it
is
better
that
is
would
be
a
less
evil
to
die
than
to
live
since
it
is
certain
that
by
living
they
will
grow
worse
plutarch
calls
such
men
a
pest
to
others
but
the
greatest
pest
to
themselves
galen
says
that
capital
punishments
are
inflicted
to
prevent
men
from
doing
harm
by
a
longer
course
of
iniquity
and
to
deter
others
by
the
fear
of
punishment
adding
that
it
is
better
men
should
die
when
they
have
souls
so
infected
with
evil
as
to
be
incurable
there
are
some
who
think
that
these
are
the
persons
meant
by
the
apostle
john
who
describes
them
as
sinning
a
sin
unto
death
but
as
their
arguments
are
not
satisfactory
charity
requires
that
no
one
should
be
deemed
incorrigible
except
upon
the
clearest
grounds
so
that
punishment
with
such
an
end
in
view
can
only
be
inflicted
for
important
causes
viii
the
benefit
accruing
to
an
injured
person
from
the
punishment
of
an
offender
consists
in
his
being
secured
in
future
against
a
recurrence
of
the
same
injury
from
that
offender
or
from
others
there
are
three
ways
of
preventing
this
recurrence
by
removing
the
offender
by
depriving
him
of
the
power
of
doing
harm
or
lastly
by
compelling
him
to
better
habits
of
thought
or
action
which
is
the
reformation
produced
by
the
punishment
already
spoken
of
it
is
not
every
kind
of
punishment
which
can
produce
such
effects
it
must
be
open
and
conspicuous
to
operate
as
an
example
that
may
deter
others
from
the
commission
of
the
same
crimes
a
vindictive
punishment
inflicted
by
an
injured
individual
or
by
any
other
person
when
it
is
restrained
by
bounds
and
limitations
of
this
kind
has
nothing
unlawful
in
it
considering
the
law
of
nature
by
itself
apart
from
all
human
and
divine
institutions
and
every
adventitious
circumstance
that
may
create
a
deviation
from
the
primitive
dictates
of
nature
we
have
said
that
it
may
be
inflicted
by
any
other
individual
as
well
as
by
the
injured
person
for
it
is
conformable
to
nature
that
one
man
should
assist
another
but
as
our
judgment
is
apt
to
be
biassed
by
our
affections
in
cases
where
our
interest
is
concerned
since
the
formation
of
families
into
states
judges
have
been
appointed
and
invested
with
the
power
of
punishing
the
guilty
whereby
the
natural
liberty
of
personal
redress
originally
allowed
to
individuals
was
abolished
or
at
least
abridged
and
it
is
only
in
places
on
the
seas
for
instance
where
no
judicial
remedy
can
be
obtained
that
this
natural
liberty
continues
in
force
there
is
a
circumstance
related
of
julius
caesar
applicable
to
this
subject
while
he
was
only
in
a
private
station
being
taken
prisoner
by
some
pirates
after
he
had
redeemed
himself
by
a
sum
of
money
he
applied
to
the
proconsul
for
redress
but
his
application
being
neglected
he
fitted
out
a
certain
number
of
ships
attacked
and
defeated
the
pirates
and
ordered
them
all
to
be
crucified
the
practice
of
private
individuals
exercising
punishment
was
the
origin
of
single
combats
so
familiar
to
the
germans
before
the
introduction
of
christianity
and
not
yet
sufficiently
laid
aside
we
are
informed
by
velleius
paterculus
in
his
second
book
that
the
germans
were
surprised
to
see
the
forms
of
roman
jurisprudence
and
those
disputes
which
they
themselves
decided
by
the
sword
settled
by
law
by
the
jewish
law
the
nearest
in
blood
to
the
deceased
were
allowed
to
kill
a
murderer
if
taken
beyond
the
places
of
refuge
and
the
jewish
interpreters
observe
that
in
general
the
infliction
of
punishment
as
a
retaliation
for
murder
it
intrusted
to
no
hand
but
that
of
the
judge
as
it
is
difficult
for
an
individual
in
his
own
case
to
moderate
his
resentment
the
same
custom
of
allowing
individuals
to
avenge
their
own
wrongs
prevailed
among
the
ancient
greeks
as
we
find
from
the
words
of
theoclymenes
in
homer
odyssey
but
it
prevailed
most
in
countries
where
public
courts
of
justice
were
not
established
from
hence
augustin
defines
those
wars
to
be
just
which
are
intended
to
avenge
injuries
and
plato
in
his
twelfth
book
on
a
commonwealth
justifies
the
prolongation
of
hostilities
till
the
aggressor
is
reduced
to
submit
to
just
and
equitable
terms
ix
general
utility
which
was
considered
as
the
third
end
proposed
by
punishment
may
be
divided
into
the
same
number
of
parts
as
the
benefit
accruing
from
thence
to
individuals
for
these
are
the
objects
in
view
either
to
prevent
the
individual
who
has
injured
one
person
from
doing
injury
to
others
an
object
which
can
be
accomplished
only
by
removing
the
offender
disarming
him
of
the
means
of
farther
injury
or
by
reforming
him
or
it
may
be
inflicted
to
deter
others
from
being
allured
by
an
example
of
impunity
to
commit
acts
of
molestation
or
enmity
and
the
infliction
of
punishment
for
such
reasons
is
a
right
granted
by
the
law
of
nature
to
every
individual
upon
this
principle
plutarch
observes
in
the
life
of
pelopidas
that
good
men
are
designed
by
nature
for
the
office
of
perpetual
magistracy
and
superiority
belongs
to
those
in
whom
the
characters
of
truth
and
justice
unite
but
as
it
requires
a
painful
degree
of
patience
to
examine
into
facts
and
no
inconsiderable
share
of
skill
and
equity
to
affix
the
extent
of
punishments
in
order
to
prevent
quarrels
from
arising
through
the
presuming
conceit
which
every
man
entertains
of
his
own
wisdom
and
to
which
others
are
averse
to
yield
in
all
well
regulated
communities
it
has
been
usual
to
select
for
the
tribunals
of
justice
those
who
were
deemed
worthy
of
such
honour
or
likely
to
become
so
from
their
integrity
and
wisdom
democritus
has
said
there
would
have
been
no
occasion
for
laws
to
prevent
every
man
from
living
according
to
his
own
humour
if
one
had
not
done
injury
to
another
for
envy
was
the
origin
of
strife
but
as
we
have
just
observed
that
it
happens
in
the
case
of
revenge
so
in
this
kind
of
punishment
inflicted
for
the
sake
of
example
there
are
traces
and
remains
of
ancient
law
in
those
places
and
among
those
persons
that
are
subject
to
no
civil
jurisdiction
and
in
certain
other
cases
besides
thus
any
hebrew
according
to
the
customs
of
that
people
if
he
should
turn
away
from
god
or
from
the
law
of
god
or
should
seduce
others
to
false
worship
might
immediately
be
put
to
death
by
any
one
whatsoever
the
hebrews
call
that
an
act
of
zeal
which
was
first
done
by
phinehas
and
which
afterwards
became
a
custom
thus
mattathias
slew
a
jew
who
was
polluting
himself
with
grecian
rites
in
the
same
manner
in
the
book
commonly
called
the
third
book
of
maccabees
it
is
related
that
three
hundred
other
jews
were
put
to
death
by
their
own
countrymen
nor
could
any
other
pretext
be
assigned
for
stoning
stephen
and
conspiring
against
paul
philo
and
josephus
abound
in
instances
of
this
kind
there
are
many
countries
where
we
may
trace
the
remains
of
primitive
law
in
the
plenary
power
allowed
to
masters
over
their
slaves
and
to
parents
over
their
children
extending
even
to
inflict
the
punishment
of
death
so
the
ephori
of
sparta
might
put
a
citizen
to
death
without
the
formality
of
trial
from
what
has
been
said
it
is
easy
to
infer
what
punishment
the
law
of
nature
authorises
and
how
far
it
has
remained
in
force
x
we
come
now
to
consider
whether
the
law
of
the
gospel
has
confined
that
liberty
within
closer
bounds
it
has
been
observed
in
another
part
of
this
treatise
that
it
is
not
surprising
that
some
things
which
are
allowed
by
natural
and
civil
law
should
be
forbidden
by
the
divine
law
owing
to
its
great
perfection
and
the
superiority
of
its
rewards
over
any
thing
that
human
nature
can
bestow
to
the
attainment
of
which
it
is
not
unreasonable
that
virtues
should
be
required
far
exceeding
the
simple
precepts
of
nature
those
kinds
of
correction
that
leave
neither
any
mark
of
infamy
nor
any
permanent
injury
but
are
suited
to
the
age
or
other
circumstances
of
the
sufferer
if
inflicted
by
those
who
derive
such
a
permission
from
human
laws
for
instance
by
parents
guardians
or
masters
contain
nothing
repugnant
to
the
precepts
of
the
gospel
as
may
be
clearly
understood
from
the
nature
of
the
thing
itself
for
they
are
remedies
to
the
mind
no
less
harmless
than
medicines
ungrateful
to
the
palate
are
to
the
body
but
as
to
revenge
the
case
is
different
for
the
infliction
of
punishment
only
to
gratify
resentment
so
far
from
being
conformable
to
the
gospel
has
been
shewn
above
to
be
repugnant
even
to
the
law
of
nature
the
jewish
law
indeed
not
only
forbids
the
cherishing
of
hatred
against
a
neighbour
that
is
one
of
the
same
country
and
people
but
requires
certain
common
acts
of
kindness
to
be
bestowed
even
upon
enemies
of
that
description
the
gospel
therefore
comprehending
all
men
under
the
appellation
of
neighbour
not
only
forbids
us
to
hurt
our
enemies
but
commands
us
to
do
them
good
a
commandment
clearly
stated
in
the
gospel
of
matthew
yet
the
law
permitted
the
jews
to
seek
revenge
for
injuries
of
a
more
grievous
kind
not
with
their
own
hands
but
by
appealing
to
the
judge
but
christ
does
not
give
us
the
same
permission
as
appears
from
that
opposition
which
he
makes
between
the
permissions
of
former
times
and
those
of
his
own
law
you
have
heard
that
it
was
said
an
eye
for
an
eye
but
i
say
unto
you
love
your
enemies
etc
for
although
what
follows
relates
peculiarly
to
the
repelling
of
injury
and
in
some
measure
abridges
this
permission
yet
it
passes
a
much
greater
censure
upon
revenge
rejecting
it
as
an
indulgence
suitable
only
to
a
more
imperfect
and
carnal
state
to
inflict
punishment
by
way
of
retaliation
was
disapproved
of
even
by
those
of
the
jews
who
were
distinguished
for
their
worth
and
wisdom
because
they
regarded
not
only
the
letter
but
the
purpose
and
spirit
of
the
law
this
appears
from
philo
in
whose
writings
we
find
the
jews
of
alexandria
upon
the
calamity
of
flaccus
their
persecutor
addressing
themselves
to
god
in
the
following
language
we
do
not
rejoice
o
lord
in
the
calamity
or
punishment
of
an
enemy
being
taught
by
thy
holy
laws
to
feel
for
the
miseries
of
men
and
in
this
case
we
may
apply
that
general
command
given
by
christ
to
forgive
all
who
have
offended
or
injured
us
that
is
neither
to
do
nor
to
wish
them
evil
through
resentment
of
the
evil
they
have
done
to
us
but
what
can
be
said
of
revenge
not
as
regarding
the
past
but
as
providing
security
for
the
future
here
too
christ
requires
of
his
followers
the
same
disposition
to
pardon
injuries
particularly
if
the
offender
shews
any
probable
signs
of
repentance
luke
xvii
eph
iv
iii
in
those
passages
a
full
remission
is
intended
such
a
remission
as
restores
the
offender
to
his
former
situation
of
friendship
or
confidence
and
consequently
nothing
can
be
required
of
him
under
the
name
of
punishment
besides
if
there
were
no
such
marks
of
repentance
the
reparation
of
a
loss
is
not
to
be
pursued
with
too
much
rigour
a
doctrine
inferred
from
the
precept
of
christ
enjoining
us
to
give
up
the
garment
along
with
the
cloak
but
if
it
is
likely
that
connivance
at
an
offence
will
be
attended
with
imminent
inconvenience
and
even
danger
to
ourselves
we
should
be
contented
with
such
securities
as
may
be
effectual
and
at
the
same
time
operate
with
as
little
prejudice
as
possible
to
the
offender
for
even
among
the
jews
the
law
of
retaliation
was
not
in
use
as
we
are
informed
by
josephus
and
other
writers
of
that
nation
but
in
addition
to
the
expence
incurred
which
the
law
treats
of
as
a
separate
point
the
injured
party
usually
received
a
pecuniary
fine
instead
of
retaliation
the
repayment
of
expences
being
considered
simply
as
a
restitution
and
not
a
penalty
it
remains
now
to
consider
punishment
as
providing
for
the
public
and
not
individual
security
which
is
accomplished
either
by
removing
the
guilty
person
out
of
the
way
or
by
restraining
him
from
doing
farther
mischief
or
by
deterring
others
through
the
severity
of
example
none
of
which
means
it
has
been
clearly
proved
were
abolished
by
christ
for
in
giving
his
precepts
he
affirmed
that
he
destroyed
no
part
of
the
law
the
law
of
moses
indeed
which
in
these
respects
was
to
remain
in
force
as
long
as
the
jewish
polity
existed
strictly
enjoined
magistrates
to
punish
murder
and
other
similar
crimes
but
if
the
precepts
of
christ
could
exist
in
conjunction
with
the
law
of
moses
as
far
as
it
imposed
capital
punishments
surely
they
may
exist
in
conjunction
with
human
laws
which
in
this
respect
are
but
an
imitation
of
the
divine
laws
xi
some
in
support
of
an
opposite
opinion
allege
the
supreme
mercy
of
god
as
it
is
displayed
in
the
new
covenant
and
which
is
given
as
an
example
for
men
and
for
magistrates
in
particular
to
follow
who
in
the
exercise
of
authority
execute
the
laws
of
the
deity
this
opinion
may
in
some
measure
be
true
but
not
to
that
extent
which
the
authors
of
it
intend
for
the
great
mercy
of
god
displayed
in
the
new
covenant
has
a
peculiar
reference
to
offences
against
the
primitive
law
or
even
against
the
law
of
moses
before
the
time
that
men
had
received
a
knowledge
of
the
gospel
for
offences
committed
after
the
promulgation
of
the
gospel
especially
if
they
are
accompanied
with
a
hardened
obstinacy
are
treated
with
much
severer
judgments
than
any
that
were
declared
by
moses
for
god
punishes
sins
of
that
kind
not
only
in
a
future
state
but
in
the
present
life
but
for
sins
of
that
kind
to
obtain
the
act
of
mercy
and
indulgence
the
offender
must
inflict
punishment
upon
himself
not
in
a
slight
or
trivial
manner
but
with
a
heartfelt
sorrow
and
resolution
to
sin
no
more
in
the
same
manner
it
is
maintained
that
if
men
are
actuated
by
repentance
they
are
entitled
to
impunity
we
do
not
say
that
men
are
never
actuated
by
sincere
repentance
but
it
is
not
every
kind
of
avowal
or
acknowledgment
by
which
god
is
moved
to
remit
the
whole
of
a
punishment
as
appears
from
the
case
of
david
as
the
supreme
judge
therefore
might
dispense
with
the
full
penalty
of
the
law
inflicting
death
and
yet
exercise
no
inconsiderable
severity
upon
offenders
so
now
he
may
dispense
with
the
sentence
of
eternal
death
at
the
same
time
leaving
the
sinner
to
find
an
early
grave
by
the
stroke
of
some
calamity
or
by
the
hand
of
human
justice
xii
and
xiii
another
objection
made
against
capital
punishments
is
that
such
a
kind
of
sentence
and
execution
is
cutting
off
a
criminal
from
all
possibility
of
repentance
but
those
who
make
the
objection
must
know
that
in
cases
of
that
kind
venerable
and
upright
judges
use
the
greatest
precautions
and
suffer
no
one
to
be
hurried
away
to
execution
without
a
reasonable
time
allowed
for
reflection
and
deep
abhorrence
of
his
crime
a
repentance
which
though
prevented
by
the
interposing
hand
of
death
from
producing
the
fruits
of
righteousness
we
have
reason
to
suppose
from
the
case
of
the
thief
pardoned
on
the
cross
may
be
accepted
with
god
but
if
on
the
other
hand
it
be
said
that
longer
life
might
have
been
of
more
avail
to
serious
repentance
we
may
observe
that
in
some
cases
the
reply
of
seneca
may
be
made
that
to
men
of
that
description
death
is
often
the
greatest
blessing
which
can
be
bestowed
for
in
the
words
of
eusebius
their
career
of
wickedness
can
not
otherwise
be
shortened
or
reformed
these
in
addition
to
the
preceding
arguments
in
the
former
part
of
this
treatise
may
be
deemed
a
sufficient
answer
to
those
who
assert
that
all
capital
punishments
and
even
all
punishments
without
exception
are
abolished
by
the
precepts
of
our
saviour
the
apostle
consigning
to
the
office
of
kings
the
use
of
the
sword
as
an
exercise
of
his
divine
commission
to
avenge
all
wrongs
instructs
us
to
pray
for
kings
that
as
true
christians
in
their
royal
capacity
they
may
be
a
protection
to
the
innocent
an
end
which
even
after
the
introduction
of
the
gospel
could
not
easily
be
obtained
owing
to
the
depravity
of
mankind
if
the
violence
of
some
were
not
restrained
by
the
exemplary
punishment
of
others
such
authority
is
the
more
necessary
when
even
in
the
midst
of
so
many
examples
and
punishments
the
lives
of
the
innocent
are
scarcely
secure
there
have
been
indeed
it
can
not
be
denied
happy
instances
where
the
sentence
of
death
was
changed
for
that
of
perpetual
labour
a
practice
as
we
are
informed
by
diodorus
followed
by
sabacon
king
of
egypt
a
prince
renowned
for
his
piety
balsamon
observes
that
the
penal
laws
of
rome
inflicting
death
were
most
of
them
changed
by
the
christian
emperors
of
later
times
and
other
kinds
of
punishment
were
substituted
that
the
guilty
might
receive
deeper
impressions
of
repentance
and
their
punishment
operate
as
a
more
durable
example
xiv
from
what
has
been
said
it
may
be
inferred
how
unsafe
it
is
for
a
private
christian
whether
from
motives
of
personal
interest
or
from
those
of
the
public
good
to
take
upon
himself
the
punishment
of
an
offender
and
particularly
to
inflict
death
although
as
it
has
been
said
before
it
may
in
some
cases
be
allowed
by
the
law
of
nations
a
permission
that
has
given
rise
to
the
laudable
practice
prevailing
in
some
countries
of
furnishing
adventurers
with
public
instructions
and
commissions
to
chase
and
capture
pirates
wherever
they
may
be
found
but
those
adventurers
may
be
considered
as
discharging
a
public
duty
rather
than
as
acting
upon
their
own
authority
xv
a
custom
not
unlike
to
which
prevails
in
many
places
of
not
allowing
individuals
to
bring
criminal
charges
against
others
at
their
own
pleasure
that
office
belonging
to
persons
invested
with
public
authority
to
undertake
it
so
that
no
one
can
contribute
towards
shedding
the
blood
of
another
but
as
an
act
of
necessary
duty
in
reference
to
this
custom
a
canon
of
the
council
of
eliberis
excluded
from
the
communion
any
believer
who
had
been
instrumental
in
causing
the
proscription
or
death
of
another
xviii
it
is
proper
now
to
consider
whether
all
wicked
acts
are
of
that
kind
which
are
punishable
by
human
laws
in
reply
to
which
we
may
answer
that
they
certainly
are
in
the
first
place
mere
acts
of
the
mind
or
criminal
intentions
though
by
subsequent
confession
or
some
other
accident
they
may
come
to
the
knowledge
of
others
are
not
punishable
by
human
laws
because
as
it
was
proved
in
a
former
part
of
this
treatise
it
is
not
consonant
to
the
law
of
nature
that
intentions
only
should
give
rise
to
any
right
or
obligation
amongst
men
and
in
this
sense
the
maxim
of
the
roman
law
is
to
be
taken
that
no
one
deserves
punishment
for
mere
thoughts
yet
this
does
not
prevent
intentions
when
they
have
an
influence
upon
the
conduct
from
being
considered
as
actual
deeds
and
equally
deserving
of
punishment
xix
in
the
second
place
even
outward
acts
can
not
be
punished
by
men
where
they
arise
through
some
inevitable
infirmity
of
human
nature
for
although
there
can
be
no
sin
except
where
there
is
a
freedom
of
will
yet
to
be
at
all
times
free
from
all
infirmity
and
sin
is
more
than
can
be
expected
from
the
condition
of
man
so
that
sopater
hierocles
and
seneca
among
the
philosophers
philo
among
the
jews
thucydides
among
the
historians
and
innumerable
writers
among
christians
have
maintained
that
sin
is
interwoven
with
our
very
nature
nay
indeed
a
doubt
may
be
entertained
whether
such
acts
can
rightly
and
properly
be
called
sins
for
though
seeming
to
be
voluntary
actions
they
will
be
found
when
minutely
considered
not
to
proceed
from
a
free
and
deliberate
exercise
of
the
will
laws
plutarch
in
the
life
of
should
be
framed
to
suit
possible
cases
the
legislator
may
obtain
every
beneficial
end
by
punishing
a
few
offenders
where
the
indiscriminate
punishment
of
multitudes
would
be
attended
with
no
good
effect
there
are
some
actions
which
though
not
imputable
to
human
nature
itself
are
inevitable
consequences
of
the
influence
of
bodily
habits
on
the
mind
actions
like
these
are
punishable
in
human
courts
owing
to
the
criminality
of
voluntary
contracting
or
of
not
sufficiently
guarding
against
those
habits
xx
in
the
third
place
human
courts
of
justice
can
not
take
cognizance
of
those
offences
which
neither
directly
nor
indirectly
affect
the
public
or
individuals
for
no
reason
can
be
assigned
why
such
offences
should
not
be
left
to
the
judgments
of
god
whose
eye
must
know
them
whose
equity
will
weigh
them
and
whose
power
can
punish
them
it
would
be
unnecessary
therefore
and
presumptuous
in
human
tribunals
to
assume
such
decisions
however
we
must
except
from
this
rule
those
corrective
kinds
of
punishment
designed
for
the
reformation
of
offenders
even
where
their
conduct
is
no
way
injurious
to
others
neither
are
those
actions
punishable
which
are
directly
opposite
to
the
virtues
of
compassion
liberality
or
gratitude
in
the
performance
of
which
virtues
natural
justice
allows
of
no
compulsion
xxi
the
point
necessarily
to
be
considered
next
is
the
opinion
whether
it
is
lawful
some
times
to
grant
pardon
for
the
stoics
maintain
it
not
to
be
lawful
as
may
be
seen
from
a
fragment
in
stobaeus
under
the
title
of
magistracy
from
cicero
speech
for
murena
and
towards
the
conclusion
of
seneca
books
on
clemency
but
their
arguments
are
fallacious
and
unsubstantial
they
say
that
pardon
is
the
remission
of
a
penalty
that
ought
to
be
paid
but
a
wise
man
does
every
thing
which
he
ought
to
do
here
the
fallacy
lies
in
the
use
of
the
word
ought
for
if
it
means
that
an
offender
owes
a
penalty
that
is
that
he
may
be
punished
without
injustice
it
will
not
necessarily
follow
that
the
person
who
does
not
punish
him
is
doing
what
he
ought
not
to
do
but
if
the
word
be
taken
to
imply
that
a
good
man
or
a
wise
man
ought
at
all
events
to
exact
the
penalty
it
may
be
observed
in
reply
that
this
does
not
always
happen
and
therefore
in
this
sense
the
penalty
or
punishment
may
be
considered
not
as
a
debt
but
only
a
permission
and
this
will
hold
good
both
before
and
after
the
establishment
of
penal
laws
xxii
before
the
establishment
of
penal
laws
punishment
beyond
all
doubt
might
be
inflicted
because
by
the
law
of
nature
every
offender
made
himself
subject
to
punishment
but
it
is
not
a
natural
and
inevitable
consequence
of
its
being
lawful
that
it
should
be
enforced
for
this
depends
upon
the
connection
between
the
ends
for
which
punishments
were
established
and
the
punishments
themselves
if
the
ends
proposed
therefore
are
not
immediately
necessary
in
a
moral
point
of
view
or
if
other
ends
of
a
different
kind
but
not
less
wise
and
salutary
should
be
devised
or
that
the
ends
originally
designed
may
be
obtained
by
some
other
means
in
all
these
cases
the
right
of
punishment
may
be
saved
there
being
no
immediate
occasion
to
inflict
it
thus
for
instance
where
an
offence
is
known
to
very
few
there
can
be
no
immediate
occasion
for
a
public
punishment
by
way
of
exemplary
exposure
which
in
some
cases
might
be
even
injurious
to
society
rather
than
productive
of
advantage
upon
which
cicero
in
a
letter
to
his
brother
makes
a
pertinent
remark
respecting
one
zeuxis
observing
that
had
he
once
been
brought
into
court
he
could
not
have
been
released
but
there
was
no
necessity
that
a
search
should
be
made
for
him
in
order
to
bring
him
to
trial
in
the
next
place
the
right
and
end
of
punishment
may
be
dispensed
with
where
a
man
own
services
or
those
of
his
family
are
sufficient
to
outweigh
the
consideration
of
his
offences
for
the
words
of
an
act
of
kindness
eclipses
the
fault
of
an
injury
and
in
the
last
place
where
reproof
operates
upon
an
offender
as
a
means
of
correction
and
amendment
or
where
the
injured
party
is
satisfied
with
an
acknowledgment
of
the
offence
the
occasion
for
punishment
is
done
away
it
was
this
motive
to
clemency
which
the
son
of
david
had
in
view
where
he
observes
that
it
behoves
the
righteous
to
be
merciful
for
as
all
punishment
especially
of
the
more
severe
cast
has
in
it
some
thing
which
tho
not
repugnant
to
justice
is
at
variance
at
least
with
charity
reason
easily
suffers
us
to
forbear
inflicting
it
unless
that
forbearance
is
opposed
by
some
weightier
juster
and
more
undeniable
motive
of
charity
xxiii
cases
may
occur
where
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
inflict
punishment
as
upon
notorious
and
atrocious
criminals
or
where
it
is
for
the
public
good
to
dispense
with
that
severity
or
where
the
judicial
authorities
may
use
their
own
discretion
in
mitigating
or
enforcing
the
sentence
of
the
law
upon
which
seneca
pertinently
remarks
that
the
exercise
of
lenity
should
always
be
an
act
of
free
deliberation
as
to
the
disputes
of
the
stoics
on
these
points
they
are
in
the
opinion
of
cicero
and
others
debates
upon
words
rather
than
things
consequently
they
are
less
worthy
of
philosophical
contemplation
xxiv
there
seems
to
be
a
greater
difficulty
in
deciding
what
is
to
be
done
subsequently
to
the
establishment
of
penal
laws
because
a
legislator
is
bound
in
some
measure
by
his
own
laws
but
this
as
it
was
proved
in
a
former
part
of
this
treatise
is
only
true
with
respect
to
the
legislator
in
his
individual
capacity
as
a
private
member
of
the
state
but
not
in
his
public
character
in
which
he
represents
the
whole
majesty
and
authority
of
the
state
itself
as
such
he
can
entirely
repeal
the
law
for
it
is
the
nature
of
all
human
laws
to
depend
upon
the
will
of
the
maker
not
only
for
their
origin
but
also
for
their
duration
yet
a
lawgiver
ought
not
upon
trivial
grounds
to
repeal
a
statute
for
in
so
doing
he
would
be
acting
against
the
rules
of
sovereign
justice
but
as
the
legislator
has
power
to
repeal
the
whole
of
a
law
so
in
the
case
of
some
particular
person
or
individual
action
he
may
relax
its
rigour
allowing
it
to
remain
in
other
respects
as
it
stood
before
as
an
example
of
this
the
actions
of
the
deity
may
be
cited
who
according
to
the
testimony
of
lactantius
in
enacting
his
laws
did
not
deprive
himself
of
the
exercise
of
his
mercy
to
grant
pardons
the
emperor
may
recall
his
sentence
pardon
and
release
a
criminal
because
he
further
explains
the
person
who
has
power
to
make
laws
is
not
invariably
bound
to
observe
them
yet
this
privilege
of
departing
from
the
letter
must
never
be
used
but
for
the
most
important
reasons
although
such
reasons
can
not
be
precisely
defined
yet
it
is
certain
that
since
the
establishment
of
civil
law
more
weighty
ones
are
required
to
authorise
such
pardons
than
before
that
period
because
punishments
have
derived
an
additional
sanction
from
the
authority
of
the
law
which
ought
to
be
respected
and
observed
xxv
the
reasons
for
releasing
any
one
from
the
penalties
of
the
law
are
of
two
kinds
either
internal
or
external
an
internal
reason
to
justify
a
departure
from
the
sentence
of
the
law
must
be
one
where
the
punishment
is
severe
when
compared
with
the
offence
xxvi
an
external
reason
is
one
arising
from
some
favourable
circumstance
in
the
character
of
the
offender
or
some
fair
hopes
that
may
be
entertained
of
his
future
conduct
and
these
reasons
will
have
the
most
weight
in
cases
where
the
particular
motives
for
making
the
law
cease
to
operate
for
although
a
general
reason
unopposed
by
any
other
of
a
weightier
kind
may
sufficiently
authorise
the
enaction
of
a
law
yet
where
the
peculiar
reason
for
which
that
law
was
made
has
ceased
to
exist
the
relaxation
of
it
or
even
a
total
dispensation
will
be
attended
with
less
danger
to
the
universal
authority
of
law
in
general
such
a
dispensation
indeed
is
most
allowable
where
an
offence
has
been
committed
through
ignorance
though
the
party
so
committing
it
is
not
entirely
free
from
blame
or
through
some
invincible
infirmity
of
mind
in
all
which
cases
a
christian
ruler
will
have
an
eye
to
the
example
of
god
who
under
the
old
covenant
appointed
many
such
offences
to
be
atoned
for
by
certain
expiatory
offerings
levit
iv
and
and
in
the
new
testament
he
has
expressly
declared
his
intention
to
pardon
such
offences
upon
due
repentance
luke
xxiii
heb
iv
and
tim
and
chrysostom
observes
that
theodosius
impressed
with
those
words
of
our
saviour
father
forgive
them
for
they
know
not
what
they
do
was
led
to
grant
a
pardon
to
the
people
of
antioch
xxvii
and
hence
it
is
evident
how
mistaken
ferdinand
vasquez
is
in
his
judgment
when
he
maintains
that
there
can
be
no
just
reason
for
dispensing
with
a
law
that
is
for
releasing
any
one
from
its
obligations
except
where
the
lawgiver
upon
being
consulted
expressly
declares
that
he
never
intended
it
should
be
observed
to
its
full
extent
for
he
does
not
make
the
proper
distinction
between
an
equitable
interpretation
and
the
entire
relaxation
of
a
law
for
which
reason
in
another
place
he
reproves
thomas
and
sotus
because
they
say
that
a
law
is
binding
although
the
particular
reason
of
its
being
made
may
have
ceased
as
if
they
supposed
that
the
mere
letter
of
the
law
was
the
source
of
its
obligation
an
opinion
which
they
never
did
entertain
so
far
from
every
relaxation
coming
under
the
idea
of
equity
properly
so
called
those
relaxations
may
be
freely
granted
or
refused
which
could
not
be
done
in
matters
of
equity
to
which
even
acts
of
charity
or
those
of
reasonable
policy
do
not
strictly
belong
for
there
is
a
great
difference
between
the
repeal
of
a
law
upon
fair
or
urgent
grounds
and
a
legislator
declaring
that
at
the
time
of
passing
the
law
he
had
not
the
particular
offence
or
case
in
contemplation
having
thus
far
considered
the
nature
of
dispensations
we
proceed
to
a
review
of
the
merits
upon
which
they
may
be
granted
xxviii
from
what
has
been
said
above
it
appears
that
in
punishments
two
things
are
to
be
regarded
the
offence
and
the
object
for
which
they
are
inflicted
it
is
consonant
to
justice
that
no
one
should
receive
greater
punishment
than
he
deserves
upon
which
cicero
in
one
of
his
letters
observes
that
the
same
moderation
which
is
commended
in
all
other
things
ought
to
be
observed
in
punishments
papinian
therefore
calls
punishment
an
estimation
of
demerit
but
this
equality
established
between
crime
and
punishment
says
demosthenes
in
his
letter
in
behalf
of
the
children
of
lycurgus
is
not
the
only
thing
to
be
considered
the
object
and
intention
also
of
the
delinquent
must
be
weighed
and
taken
into
the
account
but
if
care
be
taken
to
inflict
no
more
punishment
than
is
due
for
an
offence
it
may
be
greater
or
less
in
proportion
to
the
utility
to
be
derived
from
thence
xxix
in
examining
the
different
degrees
of
guilt
we
ought
to
take
into
the
account
the
motives
which
impelled
the
offender
to
commit
the
act
the
motives
which
ought
to
have
restrained
him
therefrom
and
how
far
he
was
capable
of
yielding
to
either
scarce
any
one
does
a
wicked
action
without
some
motive
or
so
far
strips
himself
of
the
nature
of
man
as
to
delight
in
such
acts
from
pure
malignity
most
men
are
led
away
by
the
indulgence
of
their
appetites
which
engender
sin
under
the
name
of
appetite
also
may
be
comprehended
the
strong
desire
of
avoiding
evil
which
is
the
most
consonant
to
nature
and
therefore
to
be
reckoned
amongst
the
most
laudable
of
all
desires
so
that
offences
committed
for
the
sake
of
avoiding
death
imprisonment
pain
or
extreme
want
are
generally
deemed
the
most
excusable
which
gave
occasion
to
demosthenes
to
say
that
we
are
justly
more
exasperated
against
those
who
abounding
in
riches
commit
evil
actions
than
against
those
who
are
impelled
by
want
to
do
the
same
humane
judges
are
always
ready
to
make
allowance
for
necessity
but
where
wealth
is
united
with
injustice
no
pretext
can
be
pleaded
in
excuse
on
this
score
polybius
excuses
the
acarnanians
for
having
neglected
when
threatened
with
impending
danger
themselves
to
fulfil
the
terms
of
a
defensive
treaty
made
with
the
greeks
against
the
aetolians
besides
the
desire
of
avoiding
evil
there
are
other
desires
tending
to
some
good
either
real
or
imaginary
real
advantages
considered
apart
from
virtues
and
those
actions
which
have
a
virtuous
tendency
are
either
such
as
give
delight
themselves
or
like
abundance
of
riches
can
procure
those
things
which
administer
to
pleasure
among
advantages
purely
imaginary
we
may
reckon
that
of
desiring
to
excel
others
from
a
spirit
of
rivalry
rather
than
from
any
laudable
intention
or
the
power
of
gratifying
resentments
which
the
farther
they
deviate
from
natural
justice
the
more
shocking
they
are
to
natural
feeling
these
appetites
the
apostle
has
described
in
terms
of
marked
censure
calling
them
the
lust
of
the
flesh
the
lust
of
the
eye
the
pride
of
life
here
the
first
member
of
the
sentence
expresses
the
love
of
pleasure
the
second
implies
the
insatiable
love
of
riches
and
the
third
comprehends
the
pursuit
of
vain
glory
and
the
desire
of
revenge
xxx
the
very
injustice
of
all
offences
ought
to
be
a
general
motive
with
men
to
restrain
them
from
the
commission
of
them
for
at
present
we
are
not
considering
sins
of
any
kind
but
those
which
extend
their
consequences
beyond
the
offender
himself
and
affect
others
and
injustice
is
the
more
heinous
and
criminal
in
proportion
to
the
greatness
of
the
injury
which
it
inflicts
in
the
highest
rank
of
crimes
and
misdemeanours
therefore
we
may
place
those
which
are
carried
into
complete
execution
and
lower
in
the
scale
we
find
those
criminal
designs
which
have
proceeded
some
degrees
but
not
to
the
last
stage
of
completion
for
the
aggravation
of
a
criminal
intent
is
measured
by
the
length
to
which
it
goes
in
either
class
that
kind
of
injustice
is
most
notorious
which
tends
to
disturb
the
common
peace
of
society
and
therefore
is
injurious
to
greater
numbers
private
wrongs
follow
in
the
next
degree
the
greatest
of
which
are
those
affecting
life
and
very
great
though
somewhat
inferior
in
the
degrees
of
enormity
are
those
that
disturb
the
peace
of
families
which
is
founded
on
the
and
the
last
description
of
wrongs
are
those
affecting
the
property
of
individuals
either
by
taking
it
with
open
violence
or
obtaining
or
injuring
it
by
fraudulent
means
some
are
of
opinion
that
a
more
accurate
order
of
division
might
have
been
used
but
that
which
is
here
followed
is
the
same
used
by
god
himself
in
the
delivery
of
his
commandments
for
under
the
name
of
parents
are
included
not
only
those
who
are
naturally
such
but
sovereign
princes
magistrates
and
rulers
of
every
description
whose
authority
is
the
of
the
fabric
of
society
next
follows
the
prohibition
of
murder
the
prohibition
of
adultery
as
a
violation
of
the
marriage
bond
the
prohibition
of
theft
and
false
evidence
and
the
catalogue
of
offences
concludes
with
the
prohibition
of
criminal
desires
among
the
immediate
causes
to
restrain
the
commission
of
a
crime
not
only
the
cruelty
of
the
act
itself
but
all
the
remote
and
possible
consequences
should
be
taken
into
the
account
if
a
fire
is
begun
or
the
barriers
that
keep
out
the
waves
are
broken
down
the
perpetrator
brings
upon
his
own
head
the
blood
of
thousands
and
all
the
guilt
of
that
ruin
by
which
they
perish
in
addition
to
the
general
characters
of
injustice
above
described
we
may
annex
the
crime
of
being
undutiful
to
parents
unkind
to
relatives
or
ungrateful
to
benefactors
which
are
each
of
them
a
violation
of
natural
and
in
some
respects
of
civil
law
the
repetition
of
these
offences
too
aggravates
their
enormity
because
wicked
habits
are
sometimes
worse
than
wicked
actions
hence
we
may
comprehend
the
natural
justice
of
that
rule
which
the
persians
followed
comparing
the
past
life
of
an
offender
with
his
present
transgression
and
this
ought
to
have
some
weight
in
cases
where
a
crime
does
not
originate
from
habit
but
from
a
momentary
occasion
but
not
so
where
a
course
of
former
rectitude
has
been
changed
into
an
unvaried
course
of
wickedness
for
in
such
cases
god
himself
has
declared
by
the
mouth
of
his
prophet
ezekiel
that
he
has
no
regard
to
the
former
life
even
profane
writers
have
the
same
clear
views
upon
the
subject
for
thucydides
observes
that
degeneracy
from
a
righteous
to
a
wicked
course
incurs
double
punishment
for
offences
are
least
pardonable
in
those
who
know
the
difference
between
right
and
wrong
in
this
respect
all
praise
and
admiration
are
due
to
the
wisdom
of
the
primitive
christians
who
in
estimating
the
magnitude
of
offences
weighed
the
preceding
and
the
subsequent
conduct
of
a
transgressor
against
the
action
for
which
he
was
to
be
punished
as
may
be
seen
from
the
council
of
ancyra
and
other
councils
it
heightens
the
enormity
of
an
offence
where
it
is
committed
in
violation
of
an
express
prohibition
of
the
law
for
in
the
language
of
tacitus
the
fear
of
prohibition
may
sometimes
operate
as
a
restraint
but
where
men
once
act
in
defiance
of
that
fear
and
shame
have
lost
all
their
force
xxxi
the
capacity
of
the
person
too
with
respect
to
judgment
disposition
age
education
and
every
other
circumstance
must
be
taken
into
consideration
when
we
look
for
resistance
or
submission
to
the
suggestions
of
wicked
inclinations
the
thought
of
immediate
danger
augments
fear
and
recent
unallayed
pain
inflames
anger
so
that
in
either
case
the
calm
dictates
of
reason
can
not
be
heard
offences
therefore
springing
from
the
influence
of
such
impressions
are
of
a
less
odious
complexion
than
those
arising
from
the
love
of
pleasure
or
the
indulgence
of
hatred
because
there
is
less
excuse
for
actions
of
the
latter
kind
the
delay
or
total
forbearance
of
which
could
occasion
no
serious
inconvenience
for
it
must
always
be
kept
in
mind
that
where
there
are
more
powerful
impediments
to
the
exercise
of
judgment
and
more
urgent
persuasives
to
natural
feeling
the
criminality
of
an
offence
is
proportionably
softened
and
these
are
the
rules
for
measuring
the
degrees
of
pardon
or
punishment
xxxii
the
pythagoreans
maintain
that
justice
lies
in
proportioning
the
punishment
to
the
offence
a
rule
which
can
not
be
admitted
to
the
full
extent
of
requiring
an
aggressor
to
suffer
nothing
more
than
a
bare
requital
of
the
injury
he
has
occasioned
for
this
is
at
variance
with
the
most
perfect
laws
which
in
cases
of
theft
sometimes
require
fourfold
and
sometimes
fivefold
restitution
to
be
made
and
the
athenian
law
besides
compelling
a
thief
to
pay
double
the
value
of
what
he
had
taken
sentenced
him
to
many
days
imprisonment
among
the
indians
as
we
are
informed
by
strabo
the
person
who
had
maimed
another
was
condemned
in
addition
to
the
penalty
of
retaliation
to
lose
his
hand
nor
is
it
right
as
philo
in
explaining
the
punishment
of
murder
justly
observes
for
the
suffering
of
an
innocent
and
guilty
person
to
be
exactly
the
same
and
hence
it
is
easy
to
see
why
certain
crimes
not
carried
into
actual
execution
and
therefore
less
injurious
than
those
which
are
so
are
punished
only
proportionably
to
the
in
this
manner
false
witnesses
were
treated
by
the
jewish
law
and
by
the
roman
law
those
who
walked
ready
armed
to
commit
murder
consequently
a
greater
degree
of
punishment
is
due
where
the
criminal
intention
is
completed
but
as
death
is
the
severest
punishment
that
can
be
inflicted
and
one
that
can
never
be
repeated
the
sentence
of
all
human
law
rests
there
though
by
the
custom
of
some
countries
death
is
accompanied
with
torture
in
cases
of
extreme
atrocity
xxxiii
in
many
instances
the
magnitude
of
a
punishment
can
only
be
measured
by
the
situation
of
the
person
on
whom
it
is
to
be
inflicted
thus
a
fine
imposed
upon
the
poor
would
be
a
heavy
sentence
though
it
would
scarcely
affect
the
rich
and
a
man
of
high
rank
would
feel
the
weight
of
a
disgrace
that
would
but
lightly
touch
an
ignoble
person
such
distinctions
are
frequently
used
by
the
roman
law
often
degenerating
into
acts
of
partiality
a
fault
from
which
the
law
of
moses
is
entirely
free
and
the
above
rules
may
be
considered
as
the
scale
for
estimating
the
different
degrees
of
punishment
xxxiv
though
punishment
does
not
exceed
the
bounds
of
justice
yet
in
certain
cases
it
may
be
mitigated
in
favour
of
a
criminal
from
motives
of
mercy
except
where
such
lenity
to
the
guilty
is
deemed
cruelty
to
the
innocent
whose
safety
is
thereby
endangered
for
the
escape
of
a
criminal
is
often
an
encouragement
to
his
own
perseverance
in
iniquity
and
to
that
of
others
who
are
encouraged
by
the
example
necessity
indeed
requires
the
sharpest
remedies
for
the
suppression
of
crimes
especially
where
the
incentives
of
habit
and
a
facility
to
commit
them
prevail
xxxv
the
divine
law
given
to
the
hebrews
punished
the
stealing
of
cattle
from
a
pasture
with
more
severity
than
breaking
into
a
house
on
account
of
the
ease
with
which
the
former
of
those
crimes
might
be
committed
exod
xxii
justin
in
speaking
of
the
scythians
describes
them
as
punishing
theft
with
more
severity
than
any
other
crime
for
as
they
have
no
covered
habitations
to
protect
their
flocks
and
herds
from
depredations
what
could
be
safe
if
thieving
were
allowed
though
the
familiarity
of
certain
crimes
may
prevent
us
from
being
surprised
at
their
perpetration
it
by
no
means
diminishes
their
atrocity
or
demands
a
mitigation
of
punishment
but
as
saturninus
says
the
of
crimes
must
be
impeded
with
the
strongest
bands
in
trials
for
offences
clemency
may
be
indulged
but
in
the
passing
of
laws
severity
should
be
regarded
for
the
general
nature
of
law
requires
that
offences
should
be
pursued
with
rigour
but
in
trials
in
which
individuals
are
the
objects
concerned
there
may
be
circumstances
to
aggravate
or
diminish
the
offence
which
leaves
room
for
the
discretionary
exercise
of
rigour
or
lenity
xxxvi
and
xxxvii
the
inclination
to
mitigate
penalties
where
the
urgent
motives
to
enforce
them
no
longer
exist
is
a
point
of
compassion
perfectly
distinct
from
the
abolition
of
punishment
altogether
nor
has
any
thing
been
omitted
that
might
tend
to
clear
up
this
difficult
and
delicate
question
but
every
point
we
trust
has
been
examined
in
its
proper
place
either
respecting
the
magnitude
of
crimes
as
measured
by
the
injury
done
the
habitual
commission
of
such
offences
or
the
influence
of
the
motives
sufficient
to
encourage
or
restrain
them
indeed
the
character
of
the
offender
affords
the
most
conclusive
means
for
judging
of
his
capacity
to
commit
the
crime
and
that
of
the
sufferer
often
contributes
something
towards
enabling
us
to
estimate
the
due
proportion
of
the
penalty
the
circumstances
of
the
time
when
the
place
where
or
the
facility
with
which
a
crime
is
perpetrated
tend
to
aggravate
or
lessen
its
enormity
the
length
of
time
intervening
between
a
criminal
design
and
its
execution
gives
us
some
opportunity
to
examine
how
far
the
perpetrator
was
actuated
by
a
malicious
purpose
but
the
true
complexion
of
a
crime
is
to
be
discovered
partly
from
the
nature
of
those
appetites
to
which
it
owes
its
birth
and
partly
on
the
other
hand
from
the
nature
of
the
motives
which
ought
to
have
restrained
them
by
this
class
of
appetites
the
magnitude
of
a
crime
may
be
judged
of
and
the
consequences
are
the
motives
which
should
operate
to
restrain
them
xxxviii
it
has
been
shewn
before
and
it
is
a
truth
founded
upon
historical
fact
that
wars
are
undertaken
as
acts
of
punishment
and
this
motive
added
to
that
of
redress
for
injuries
is
the
source
from
which
the
duties
of
nations
relating
to
war
take
their
rise
but
it
is
not
every
injury
that
can
be
construed
into
a
just
ground
of
war
for
laws
whose
vengeance
is
meant
to
protect
the
innocent
and
to
fall
upon
the
guilty
do
not
regard
every
case
as
a
sufficient
warrant
for
their
exertion
so
that
there
is
much
truth
in
the
opinion
of
sopater
who
says
that
there
are
trivial
and
common
offences
which
it
is
better
to
pass
over
unnoticed
than
to
punish
xxxix
the
maxim
laid
down
by
cato
in
his
speech
in
defence
of
the
rhodians
that
it
is
not
right
any
one
should
be
punished
upon
the
bare
suspicion
of
his
having
intended
to
commit
aggression
or
injury
was
well
applied
in
that
place
because
no
positive
decree
of
the
people
of
rhodes
could
be
alleged
against
them
nor
was
there
any
other
proof
beyond
the
conjecture
of
their
wavering
in
their
policy
but
this
maxim
is
not
universally
true
for
where
intention
has
proceeded
to
any
outward
and
visible
signs
of
insatiable
ambition
and
injustice
it
is
deemed
a
proper
object
of
jealousy
and
even
of
punishment
upon
this
principle
the
romans
as
may
be
seen
from
livy
account
in
the
xlii
book
and
xxx
chapter
of
his
history
thought
themselves
justified
in
declaring
war
against
perseus
king
of
macedon
unless
he
gave
satisfactory
proof
that
he
had
no
hostile
intentions
against
them
in
the
naval
and
military
armaments
which
he
was
preparing
and
we
are
informed
by
the
same
historians
that
the
rhodians
urged
it
as
a
rule
established
by
the
laws
and
customs
of
all
civilized
states
that
if
any
one
wished
the
destruction
of
an
enemy
he
could
not
punish
him
with
death
unless
he
had
actually
done
something
to
deserve
it
but
it
is
not
every
unjust
design
though
indicated
by
some
outward
act
which
can
authorize
and
direct
hostilities
for
if
the
actual
commission
of
crimes
and
aggressions
is
in
some
cases
proper
to
be
overlooked
much
more
will
it
be
a
mark
of
deliberate
caution
to
use
the
same
forbearance
where
nothing
further
than
the
pure
design
of
aggression
appears
a
forbearance
which
cicero
justifies
upon
the
possibility
that
the
enemy
may
have
repented
of
his
design
before
the
execution
of
it
no
conclusive
inference
can
be
drawn
from
the
severity
of
mosaic
law
against
all
intended
acts
of
impiety
and
murder
for
in
comparing
human
laws
with
the
divine
counsels
whose
depths
we
can
not
sound
we
are
liable
to
run
into
error
and
the
impulse
of
anger
where
it
is
attended
with
no
fatal
consequence
is
a
case
in
which
the
infirmity
of
human
nature
calls
for
pardon
for
altho
the
precepts
of
the
decalogue
are
designed
to
lay
a
restraint
upon
unlawful
desires
as
well
as
upon
unlawful
actions
yet
in
addition
to
the
spiritual
sense
that
which
is
called
the
carnal
or
external
commandment
applies
to
those
dispositions
that
are
manifested
by
some
open
act
this
interpretation
may
be
deduced
from
a
passage
in
the
gospel
of
mark
x
where
the
prohibition
to
defraud
is
immediately
preceded
by
the
injunction
not
to
steal
so
that
intended
aggressions
are
not
to
be
punished
by
force
of
arms
except
in
cases
of
atrocity
where
the
very
design
threatens
consequences
of
the
greatest
danger
all
punishment
therefore
must
have
in
view
either
security
against
future
aggressions
reparation
for
the
injury
done
to
national
or
private
honour
or
it
must
be
used
as
an
example
of
awful
severity
xl
it
is
proper
also
to
observe
that
kings
and
those
who
are
possessed
of
sovereign
power
have
a
right
to
exact
punishment
not
only
for
injuries
affecting
immediately
themselves
or
their
own
subjects
but
for
gross
violations
of
the
law
of
nature
and
of
nations
done
to
other
states
and
subjects
for
the
liberty
of
inflicting
punishment
for
the
peace
and
welfare
of
society
which
belonged
to
individuals
in
the
early
ages
of
the
world
was
converted
into
the
judicial
authority
of
sovereign
states
and
princes
a
right
devolving
upon
them
not
only
as
rulers
of
others
but
as
subject
to
the
controul
of
no
earthly
power
for
that
is
a
right
which
can
belong
to
no
subject
it
is
never
safe
to
leave
the
entire
assertion
of
a
man
own
rights
or
the
punishment
of
his
wrongs
to
his
own
judgment
for
he
can
not
be
entirely
disinterested
in
his
own
cause
partiality
will
make
him
fall
short
of
or
prejudice
will
make
him
exceed
the
bounds
of
justice
it
was
the
theme
of
praise
bestowed
upon
the
heroes
of
antiquity
that
in
their
most
arduous
undertakings
they
avenged
the
wrongs
of
others
rather
than
their
own
upon
this
principle
there
can
be
no
hesitation
in
pronouncing
all
wars
to
be
just
that
are
made
upon
pirates
general
robbers
and
enemies
of
the
human
race
so
far
this
opinion
agrees
with
that
of
innocentius
and
others
who
maintain
all
war
to
be
lawful
against
those
who
have
renounced
the
ties
and
law
of
nature
an
opinion
directly
the
reverse
is
held
by
victoria
vasquez
azorius
molina
and
others
who
deem
an
aggression
done
to
a
prince
his
government
or
his
subjects
or
civil
jurisdiction
over
the
aggressor
the
only
justifiable
warrant
for
inflicting
punishment
particularly
the
punishment
of
hostilities
for
they
suppose
punishment
to
be
an
effect
purely
arising
from
the
authority
of
civil
law
whereas
according
to
the
proofs
established
in
the
beginning
of
this
treatise
it
was
shewn
to
be
a
right
resulting
entirely
from
the
law
of
nature
if
the
opinion
of
those
from
whom
we
differ
be
admitted
no
enemy
will
have
a
right
to
punish
another
by
the
prosecution
of
a
just
war
a
right
which
notwithstanding
is
allowed
and
confirmed
by
the
practice
of
all
nations
not
only
after
the
defeat
of
an
enemy
but
during
the
continuance
of
a
war
and
that
too
not
from
any
civil
jurisdiction
but
from
a
natural
right
which
prevailed
long
before
the
foundation
of
states
and
which
still
exists
in
all
its
force
in
places
where
the
community
consists
of
families
distinct
and
united
as
the
subjects
of
one
sovereign
xliii
but
certain
precautions
are
necessary
to
prevent
us
from
being
carried
away
by
an
opinion
that
civil
customs
though
founded
upon
just
reasons
and
received
among
many
nations
are
to
be
reckoned
as
a
part
of
the
law
of
nature
and
in
the
next
place
it
is
necessary
to
guard
against
enumerating
as
prohibitions
of
natural
law
things
which
are
not
proved
to
be
so
as
certain
kinds
of
marriages
the
taking
of
interest
for
the
use
of
money
and
other
positive
injunctions
of
the
divine
or
mosaic
law
the
third
rule
is
to
make
an
accurate
distinction
between
general
principles
such
as
the
duty
of
living
according
to
the
dictates
of
reason
and
those
of
a
more
particular
though
not
less
obvious
meaning
as
the
duty
of
forbearing
to
take
what
belongs
to
another
to
which
many
truths
may
be
added
though
not
quite
so
easy
of
apprehension
among
which
may
be
named
the
cruelty
of
that
kind
of
punishment
which
consists
in
revenge
delighting
in
the
pain
of
another
this
is
a
method
of
proof
similar
to
that
which
occurs
in
mathematics
the
process
of
which
rises
from
truths
to
demonstrations
the
latter
of
which
though
not
intelligible
to
all
alike
upon
due
examination
obtain
assent
as
then
in
matters
of
civil
law
ignorance
is
deemed
an
excuse
so
with
respect
to
the
law
of
nature
wherever
infirmity
of
understanding
forms
an
invincible
obstruction
to
the
knowledge
of
its
rules
such
infirmity
may
be
alleged
as
a
vindication
for
as
in
cases
of
unavoidable
ignorance
a
great
degree
of
the
guilt
of
sin
is
removed
so
it
is
in
some
measure
softened
wherever
this
ignorance
subsists
though
it
may
be
owing
to
former
negligence
and
for
this
reason
aristotle
compares
barbarians
in
their
rude
unformed
state
to
persons
whose
appetites
are
rendered
sickly
by
disease
plutarch
also
observes
that
there
are
certain
infirmities
and
disorders
which
naturally
infect
the
soul
once
for
all
by
way
of
conclusion
we
may
add
that
wars
undertaken
to
inflict
punishment
may
be
suspected
of
injustice
except
there
be
manifest
and
enormous
aggressions
with
other
conspiring
causes
to
vindicate
nations
for
having
recourse
to
arms
xliv
the
progress
of
the
work
has
necessarily
led
to
the
consideration
of
offences
against
god
the
propriety
or
impropriety
of
punishing
which
by
force
of
arms
is
a
fit
subject
of
inquiry
admitting
the
affirmative
part
of
the
question
we
may
observe
that
as
in
ecclesiastical
affairs
bishops
are
intrusted
with
a
catholic
or
general
power
so
kings
besides
the
care
of
their
own
immediate
states
and
subjects
may
be
regarded
as
protectors
of
the
human
race
the
best
argument
on
the
negative
side
of
the
question
against
the
justice
of
such
wars
is
the
sufficiency
of
the
divine
omnipotence
to
avenge
its
own
wrongs
yet
the
same
may
be
said
of
other
offences
for
the
deity
possesses
sufficient
power
to
punish
them
although
he
leaves
them
to
the
sentence
of
human
tribunals
some
will
urge
and
maintain
that
other
kinds
of
offences
are
punished
only
in
cases
where
others
are
uninjured
or
endangered
by
the
commission
of
them
on
the
other
hand
it
may
be
said
that
men
punish
not
only
offences
which
directly
hurt
others
but
even
those
which
affect
them
indirectly
as
suicide
and
other
similar
crimes
although
religion
is
a
concern
between
the
soul
of
man
and
his
maker
alone
its
influence
on
human
morals
is
of
no
inconsiderable
importance
so
that
plato
had
reason
to
call
it
the
bulwark
of
authority
and
law
and
the
bond
of
every
thing
venerable
in
social
order
and
discipline
every
false
opinion
in
divine
things
says
plutarch
is
pernicious
betraying
itself
in
the
disorders
of
the
imagination
wherever
it
takes
root
and
springs
up
into
action
so
that
aristotle
reckons
the
care
and
support
of
religion
the
first
of
public
concerns
this
is
a
truth
applying
not
to
any
particular
state
but
to
all
governments
and
to
human
society
in
every
shape
an
avowal
which
xenophon
makes
the
characteristic
of
a
great
and
wise
prince
attributing
to
cyrus
a
declaration
of
his
firm
persuasion
that
the
more
his
subjects
feared
god
the
more
obedient
he
should
find
them
to
his
laws
and
the
more
attached
to
his
person
but
once
remove
the
motives
of
religion
says
tully
and
you
destroy
faith
the
intercourse
between
man
and
man
and
justice
the
most
excellent
of
all
virtues
the
opinions
of
epicurus
afford
a
sufficient
proof
of
this
for
in
banishing
the
providence
of
god
from
his
system
he
made
justice
nothing
but
an
empty
name
springing
from
human
conventions
founded
on
and
restraining
men
from
the
commission
of
crimes
by
no
other
principle
but
that
of
fear
but
there
is
a
wider
sphere
than
the
internal
welfare
of
independent
states
on
which
religion
operates
in
the
separate
society
which
every
kingdom
state
or
country
forms
within
itself
the
place
of
religion
may
occasionally
be
supplied
by
the
influence
and
execution
of
municipal
laws
but
in
all
the
transactions
of
the
great
community
at
large
where
civil
laws
are
silent
and
tribunals
give
way
to
the
decision
of
the
sword
the
law
of
nature
and
of
nations
founded
upon
the
fear
of
god
and
obedience
to
his
will
is
the
standard
of
right
to
which
kings
and
sovereign
states
appeal
a
violation
of
which
is
regarded
as
a
violation
of
the
divine
law
xlv
but
to
take
a
closer
view
of
the
subject
we
must
observe
that
true
religion
which
is
the
same
at
all
periods
of
time
rests
upon
four
evident
and
universally
acknowledged
truths
the
first
of
which
is
the
being
and
unity
of
god
the
second
that
god
is
not
any
of
the
things
that
can
be
seen
but
of
a
nature
too
sublime
to
be
the
object
of
human
conception
or
of
human
sight
the
third
is
that
with
the
eye
of
his
providence
he
regards
the
events
of
this
world
and
regulates
them
with
the
most
equitable
and
unerring
judgments
the
fourth
is
that
he
is
the
creator
of
all
things
except
himself
and
these
four
truths
are
unfolded
and
laid
down
in
an
equal
number
of
commandments
the
first
of
which
plainly
declares
the
unity
of
god
the
second
forbids
any
representation
by
painting
or
image
to
be
made
of
that
being
who
is
invisible
to
mortal
eye
tacitus
bears
testimony
to
the
spiritual
nature
of
the
jewish
religion
for
he
says
that
the
jews
have
nothing
but
a
mental
conception
of
one
god
and
they
look
upon
every
attempt
to
represent
him
under
the
appearance
of
human
form
as
a
profanation
of
his
heavenly
nature
from
the
third
commandment
we
deduce
his
knowledge
of
all
human
transactions
even
of
our
very
thoughts
an
omniscience
upon
which
the
obligation
and
sanctity
of
oaths
is
founded
for
god
is
a
witness
even
of
the
secret
designs
of
the
heart
so
that
every
solemn
oath
is
an
appeal
to
his
justice
and
his
power
for
the
vindication
of
truth
and
the
punishment
of
the
fourth
commandment
presents
us
with
an
account
of
the
creation
of
the
world
to
commemorate
which
god
appointed
the
sabbath
commanding
it
to
be
observed
with
a
degree
of
reverence
above
every
other
sacred
institution
for
the
violation
of
any
other
rites
such
as
those
respecting
forbidden
meats
was
left
to
the
discretionary
punishment
of
the
law
but
offences
against
the
sabbath
were
capital
because
considering
the
nature
and
design
of
its
origin
such
contempt
implied
a
disbelief
that
the
world
was
created
by
god
now
the
creation
of
the
world
by
god
affords
a
tacit
proof
of
his
goodness
wisdom
eternity
and
power
and
the
effect
of
this
contemplative
knowledge
is
the
offering
of
honour
love
worship
and
obedience
to
god
so
that
aristotle
says
that
the
man
who
denies
that
god
ought
to
be
honoured
or
parents
loved
should
be
taught
to
renounce
his
error
not
by
reasoning
but
by
punishment
and
in
another
place
he
observes
that
some
actions
are
proper
on
certain
occasions
but
reverence
for
the
majesty
of
god
is
requisite
at
all
times
and
in
all
places
the
truth
of
those
contemplative
opinions
may
undoubtedly
be
proved
from
the
nature
of
things
the
clearest
of
which
proofs
is
the
evidence
of
sense
shewing
the
existence
of
things
which
naturally
leads
us
to
consider
the
time
when
they
had
no
being
but
as
all
are
not
able
to
understand
these
arguments
and
others
of
the
same
kind
it
is
sufficient
to
observe
that
in
all
ages
and
all
countries
of
the
world
with
very
few
exceptions
these
opinions
have
found
a
general
reception
with
those
who
were
too
plain
in
their
dealings
and
ingenuous
in
their
designs
to
impose
upon
others
and
with
many
who
had
too
much
sagacity
to
be
deceived
themselves
but
when
amid
such
variety
of
laws
customs
and
opinions
there
is
so
general
an
agreement
upon
one
point
that
agreement
may
be
adduced
as
a
proof
that
such
a
belief
owes
its
origin
to
the
primitive
ages
of
the
world
from
whence
it
has
been
derived
to
us
when
we
consider
too
that
it
has
never
been
clearly
refuted
it
is
a
sufficient
reason
to
establish
our
faith
xlvi
there
is
no
excuse
therefore
for
the
rejection
of
those
opinions
even
in
cases
where
there
is
no
intuitive
sagacity
to
discover
new
proofs
or
to
comprehend
old
ones
as
there
are
so
many
guides
both
in
nature
and
reason
to
lead
men
to
the
knowledge
of
those
truths
and
as
no
solid
arguments
have
ever
been
produced
to
establish
a
contrary
belief
but
as
human
punishments
form
the
subject
of
our
present
inquiry
it
is
right
to
make
a
distinction
between
opinions
themselves
and
the
manner
of
deviating
from
them
the
belief
in
a
supreme
being
and
in
the
controul
of
his
providence
over
human
affairs
is
one
of
those
universal
tenets
to
be
found
in
all
religions
whether
true
or
false
and
in
reality
to
deny
the
being
of
a
god
and
to
deny
the
interposal
of
his
providence
in
human
affairs
amounts
in
its
moral
consequences
to
the
same
thing
and
it
is
for
this
reason
these
two
opinions
have
been
inseparably
united
in
all
ages
and
among
every
civilized
people
consequently
we
find
that
in
all
well
governed
states
wholesome
laws
have
been
enacted
to
restrain
those
who
disturb
those
opinions
which
have
always
been
regarded
as
the
chief
support
of
social
order
and
all
contempt
shewn
to
those
opinions
has
always
been
considered
as
contempt
shewn
to
society
itself
which
it
consequently
has
a
right
to
punish
xlvii
there
are
other
truths
not
equally
such
as
these
that
there
are
not
more
gods
than
one
that
no
visible
thing
neither
the
world
nor
the
heavens
nor
the
sun
nor
the
air
is
god
that
the
world
and
the
matter
of
which
it
is
formed
have
not
existed
from
all
eternity
but
were
made
by
god
so
that
we
see
the
knowledge
of
these
truths
disfigured
and
almost
entirely
obliterated
among
many
nations
by
the
lapse
of
time
and
this
might
the
more
easily
happen
as
there
were
no
legal
provisions
made
to
preserve
the
purity
of
these
truths
which
were
not
considered
as
essential
to
the
very
existence
of
all
religion
the
law
indeed
given
to
that
people
who
were
instructed
in
the
clear
knowledge
of
these
truths
by
the
mouths
of
the
prophets
by
miracles
seen
with
their
own
eyes
or
brought
to
their
ears
by
the
reports
of
the
most
undoubted
testimony
that
law
though
it
expresses
the
greatest
abhorrence
of
the
worship
of
false
gods
does
not
inflict
the
punishment
of
death
upon
all
convicted
of
that
crime
but
only
in
particular
instances
where
they
have
seduced
others
into
idolatry
or
where
a
state
has
introduced
the
worship
of
unknown
gods
or
where
the
true
worship
of
god
and
obedience
to
his
laws
have
been
forsaken
for
the
worship
of
the
stars
which
paul
calls
serving
the
creature
above
the
creator
an
offence
which
was
for
some
time
punished
among
the
descendants
of
esau
those
too
who
offered
their
children
to
moloch
that
is
to
saturn
were
punished
with
death
yet
the
canaanites
and
the
neighbouring
nations
who
had
long
been
sunk
into
the
most
depraved
superstitions
were
not
consigned
by
god
to
immediate
punishment
but
were
left
to
fill
up
the
measure
of
their
crimes
and
there
were
other
nations
where
in
the
language
of
scripture
god
winked
at
the
times
of
this
ignorance
where
men
have
had
no
means
of
arriving
at
the
knowledge
of
a
true
god
as
their
superstitions
and
errors
are
excusable
so
where
in
despite
of
knowledge
they
have
deified
daemons
and
vices
which
they
knew
to
be
such
their
superstitions
are
not
to
be
called
errors
but
impieties
and
no
less
impious
is
the
supposed
homage
that
is
paid
to
god
with
the
blood
of
innocent
human
victims
and
darius
king
of
the
persians
and
gelo
king
of
syracuse
are
commended
for
abstaining
from
such
practices
plutarch
informs
us
of
some
barbarians
who
would
have
been
punished
by
the
romans
for
offering
human
victims
to
the
deity
had
they
not
pleaded
the
antiquity
of
the
custom
which
was
admitted
as
an
excuse
though
they
were
strictly
enjoined
not
to
follow
the
same
custom
in
future
xlviii
from
the
kind
of
evidence
on
which
christianity
rests
it
is
plain
that
no
force
should
be
used
with
nations
to
promote
its
acceptance
it
is
not
merely
by
natural
arguments
it
can
gain
assent
for
it
has
made
an
addition
of
many
things
to
natural
religion
its
evidence
rests
upon
the
history
of
christ
resurrection
and
upon
the
miracles
performed
by
himself
and
his
apostles
so
that
it
is
a
matter
of
fact
proved
by
the
most
undeniable
evidence
and
of
great
antiquity
therefore
a
doctrine
of
this
kind
can
not
be
thoroughly
received
upon
the
first
hearing
of
it
without
the
secret
assistance
of
god
an
assistance
not
given
as
a
reward
for
the
merit
of
works
so
that
wherever
it
is
withheld
or
less
copiously
bestowed
it
is
done
for
reasons
which
though
just
are
generally
unknown
to
us
and
therefore
not
punishable
by
human
judgments
for
it
is
the
custom
in
the
sacred
writings
to
assign
the
divine
pleasure
as
the
cause
of
things
unknown
to
us
there
is
another
reason
of
no
less
weight
which
is
that
christ
being
the
author
of
a
new
law
will
have
no
one
brought
to
embrace
his
doctrine
by
the
fear
of
human
punishments
nor
is
the
reason
at
all
weakened
by
the
objection
drawn
from
the
parable
of
the
where
it
is
said
the
messengers
are
commanded
to
compel
the
guests
to
come
in
for
the
term
compel
here
signifies
nothing
more
than
an
earnest
entreaty
a
sense
in
which
it
is
used
in
other
parts
of
the
new
testament
implying
an
earnest
request
made
to
any
one
xlix
but
to
obstruct
the
teachers
of
christianity
by
pains
and
penalties
is
undoubtedly
contrary
to
natural
law
and
reason
for
the
doctrine
of
christ
apart
from
all
the
corruptions
added
by
the
inventions
of
men
contains
nothing
hurtful
but
every
thing
beneficial
to
society
the
thing
speaks
for
itself
and
even
those
who
were
strangers
to
the
doctrine
itself
were
obliged
to
acknowledge
the
truth
of
this
pliny
says
that
the
christians
bound
themselves
by
an
oath
to
commit
neither
theft
nor
robbery
nor
to
violate
their
word
it
was
a
common
saying
caius
seius
is
a
good
man
but
he
is
a
christian
nor
indeed
can
any
danger
be
apprehended
from
the
spreading
of
doctrines
calculated
to
inspire
greater
sanctity
of
manners
and
the
purest
principles
of
obedience
to
lawful
sovereigns
philo
has
recorded
a
beautiful
saying
of
augustus
who
observed
that
the
assemblies
of
the
jews
were
not
bacchanalian
revels
or
meetings
to
disturb
the
public
peace
but
schools
of
virtue
it
seems
unjust
to
persecute
with
punishments
those
who
receive
the
law
of
christ
as
true
but
entertain
doubts
or
errors
on
some
external
points
taking
them
in
an
ambiguous
meaning
or
different
from
the
ancient
christians
in
their
explanation
of
them
a
point
which
is
proved
by
what
has
been
said
above
and
by
the
ancient
example
of
the
jews
for
possessing
a
law
which
allowed
them
to
inflict
temporal
punishments
they
never
exercised
that
authority
upon
the
sadducees
who
denied
the
doctrine
of
a
resurrection
a
doctrine
of
the
greatest
truth
though
but
faintly
delivered
in
that
law
and
under
a
typical
application
of
words
and
circumstances
but
if
there
should
be
any
weighty
error
that
discerning
judges
could
easily
refute
by
an
appeal
to
sacred
authority
or
to
the
opinions
of
antiquity
here
too
it
would
be
necessary
to
make
allowance
for
ingrafted
opinions
that
have
grown
up
to
form
an
inseparable
part
of
the
human
mind
and
for
the
zealous
attachment
of
every
one
to
his
own
tenets
an
evil
which
galen
says
is
more
difficult
to
be
eradicated
than
any
constitutional
disease

far
answerable
for

acts

i
the
next
topic
of
inquiry
relates
to
the
communication
of
punishment
as
inflicted
upon
accomplices
who
in
that
capacity
can
not
be
said
to
be
punished
for
the
guilt
of
others
but
for
their
own
and
from
what
has
been
said
above
upon
the
loss
sustained
from
injury
it
may
be
understood
who
are
the
persons
that
come
under
this
description
for
the
partnership
in
loss
and
the
partnership
in
guilt
are
regulated
by
nearly
the
same
principles
yet
the
obligation
to
repair
a
loss
does
not
always
imply
guilt
except
where
there
has
been
any
notorious
malice
in
which
case
every
damage
renders
the
party
who
has
occasioned
it
liable
to
make
reparation
so
that
persons
ordering
the
commission
of
any
wicked
or
hostile
act
giving
the
requisite
consent
to
it
supplying
the
aggressor
with
assistance
or
protection
or
in
any
other
shape
partaking
of
the
crime
by
giving
counsel
commendation
or
assent
to
his
act
or
when
they
have
power
to
forbid
the
commission
of
such
an
act
by
forbearing
to
exercise
their
authority
or
by
refusing
to
afford
the
succour
which
they
are
bound
by
the
law
of
nature
or
by
treaty
to
give
to
the
injured
party
by
not
using
with
the
offender
that
power
of
dissuasion
which
they
have
a
right
to
do
or
lastly
by
concealing
what
they
ought
to
make
known
in
all
these
cases
such
persons
are
punishable
as
accomplices
if
they
are
convicted
of
that
degree
of
malice
which
constitutes
a
crime
and
merits
punishment
points
which
have
before
been
discussed
ii
the
case
will
be
made
clearer
by
examples
a
civil
community
is
no
more
bound
than
any
other
society
by
an
act
of
individual
members
except
that
act
be
done
by
its
express
consent
and
authority
or
it
has
neglected
to
disavow
such
a
proceeding
hence
it
is
formally
stipulated
in
almost
all
treaties
that
no
acts
or
aggressions
are
to
be
ascribed
to
a
state
except
those
which
are
done
in
the
name
of
the
sovereign
and
by
persons
acting
expressly
under
the
authority
of
his
commission
so
a
father
is
not
answerable
for
the
misconduct
of
his
children
a
master
for
that
of
his
servants
nor
a
ruler
for
the
acts
of
those
under
him
unless
there
appears
in
any
of
these
some
connivance
or
encouragement
in
promoting
that
misconduct
or
those
acts
in
the
case
of
a
sovereign
responsibility
for
the
acts
of
his
subjects
there
are
two
things
to
be
considered
which
require
minute
inquiry
and
mature
deliberation
and
those
are
the
forbearance
and
the
encouragement
or
protection
which
he
has
shewn
to
their
transgressions
as
to
forbearance
it
is
an
acknowledged
point
that
when
he
knows
of
a
delinquency
which
he
neither
forbids
nor
punishes
when
he
is
both
able
and
bound
to
do
so
he
becomes
an
accessory
to
the
guilt
thereof
cicero
in
his
speech
against
piso
says
it
makes
no
great
difference
especially
in
a
consul
whether
he
harasses
the
government
by
moving
ruinous
laws
and
making
mischievous
speeches
or
suffers
others
to
do
the
same
if
a
slave
has
committed
a
murder
with
the
knowledge
of
his
master
the
master
becomes
answerable
for
the
entire
deed
as
it
was
done
with
his
concurrence
but
as
we
have
said
before
besides
the
knowledge
of
a
deed
to
constitute
a
participation
in
the
guilt
the
person
so
knowing
it
must
possess
the
power
to
prevent
it
and
this
is
what
is
meant
by
the
legal
phrase
that
the
knowledge
of
a
crime
when
it
is
ordered
to
be
punished
is
taken
in
the
sense
of
forbearance
or
connivance
and
it
is
supposed
that
the
person
who
ought
to
have
prevented
it
did
not
do
so
in
this
place
knowledge
implies
a
concurrence
of
will
and
connivance
a
concurrence
of
design
a
master
therefore
is
not
bound
by
the
act
of
a
slave
who
has
claimed
his
freedom
and
done
any
thing
in
despite
of
his
master
because
the
knowledge
of
a
crime
without
ability
to
prevent
it
by
disclosure
or
some
other
means
can
not
be
construed
into
an
act
of
guilt
so
parents
are
bound
by
the
acts
of
children
but
only
in
cases
where
they
have
the
children
under
their
authority
on
the
other
hand
altho
by
having
them
in
their
power
they
might
have
prevented
their
misconduct
they
will
not
be
answerable
for
it
unless
they
had
a
knowledge
of
it
also
for
there
ought
to
be
a
concurrence
of
knowledge
and
forbearance
or
encouragement
to
involve
any
one
in
the
guilt
of
another
actions
circumstances
all
of
which
by
a
parity
of
reasoning
may
be
applied
to
the
connection
between
sovereigns
and
subjects
a
connection
founded
on
principles
both
of
natural
and
civil
law
iii
the
matter
that
necessarily
comes
next
under
consideration
is
the
case
of
those
who
screen
delinquents
from
punishment
it
was
before
observed
that
according
to
the
law
of
nature
no
one
could
inflict
punishment
but
a
person
entirely
free
from
the
guilt
of
the
crime
which
he
was
going
to
punish
but
since
established
governments
were
formed
it
has
been
a
settled
rule
to
leave
the
offences
of
individuals
which
affect
their
own
community
to
those
states
themselves
or
to
their
rulers
to
punish
or
pardon
them
at
their
discretion
but
they
have
not
the
same
plenary
authority
or
discretion
respecting
offences
which
affect
society
at
large
and
which
other
independent
states
or
their
rulers
have
a
right
to
punish
in
the
same
manner
as
in
every
country
popular
actions
are
allowed
for
certain
misdemeanors
much
less
is
any
state
at
liberty
to
pass
over
in
any
of
its
subjects
crimes
affecting
other
independent
states
or
sovereigns
on
which
account
any
sovereign
state
or
prince
has
a
right
to
require
another
power
to
punish
any
of
its
subjects
offending
in
the
above
named
respect
a
right
essential
to
the
dignity
and
security
of
all
governments
iv
but
as
it
is
not
usual
for
one
state
to
allow
the
armed
force
of
another
to
enter
her
territories
under
the
pretext
of
inflicting
punishment
upon
an
offender
it
is
necessary
that
the
power
in
whose
kingdom
an
offender
resides
should
upon
the
complaint
of
the
aggrieved
party
either
punish
him
itself
or
deliver
him
up
to
the
discretion
of
that
party
innumerable
instances
of
such
demands
to
deliver
up
offenders
occur
both
in
sacred
and
profane
history
thus
the
other
israelites
required
the
benjamites
to
deliver
up
offenders
jud
and
the
philistines
demanded
of
the
hebrews
the
surrender
of
samson
as
a
criminal
jud
in
the
same
manner
the
gauls
made
a
demand
that
the
fabii
should
be
surrendered
for
having
fought
against
them
sylla
too
as
sallust
informs
us
urged
bocchus
to
deliver
up
jugurtha
and
by
so
doing
to
relieve
the
romans
from
the
bitter
necessity
of
implicating
him
for
his
erroneous
conduct
in
the
same
guilt
with
that
most
desperate
villain
yet
all
these
instances
are
to
be
understood
not
as
strictly
binding
a
people
or
sovereign
prince
to
the
actual
surrender
of
offenders
but
allowing
them
the
alternative
of
either
punishing
or
delivering
them
up
for
it
was
upon
this
ground
as
we
are
informed
that
the
eleans
made
war
upon
the
lacedaemonians
because
the
latter
neglected
to
punish
their
subjects
who
had
committed
aggressions
upon
that
people
that
is
they
had
neither
punished
nor
delivered
them
up
for
the
obligation
may
be
taken
either
way
that
being
left
to
the
choice
of
the
aggrieved
person
or
nation
in
order
to
make
the
satisfaction
the
more
complete
the
surrender
here
meant
is
nothing
more
than
delivering
up
a
citizen
or
subject
to
the
power
of
another
state
to
decide
upon
his
punishment
but
this
permission
neither
gives
nor
takes
away
any
right
it
only
removes
an
impediment
to
the
prosecution
of
a
right
wherefore
if
that
other
people
make
no
use
of
the
permitted
right
the
offender
who
has
been
delivered
up
is
in
such
a
situation
that
he
either
may
or
may
not
be
punished
either
of
which
may
happen
in
the
case
of
many
offences
but
the
right
of
a
state
as
to
the
enjoyment
of
its
own
laws
and
many
other
advantages
is
not
lost
by
any
particular
act
without
a
formal
decree
and
judgment
unless
in
any
way
it
has
been
previously
enacted
that
certain
acts
or
certain
omissions
shall
amount
to
a
forfeiture
of
some
particular
rights
and
privileges
in
the
same
manner
goods
if
surrendered
but
not
accepted
will
remain
the
property
of
the
former
owner
but
if
the
surrender
of
a
citizen
has
been
accepted
and
by
some
accident
the
person
so
surrendered
shall
afterwards
return
home
he
will
no
longer
be
a
citizen
except
by
some
new
act
of
grace
what
has
been
said
of
punishing
or
giving
up
aggressors
applies
not
only
to
those
who
always
have
been
subjects
of
the
sovereign
in
whose
dominions
they
are
now
found
but
to
those
also
who
after
the
commission
of
a
crime
have
fled
to
some
place
for
refuge
nor
do
the
so
much
talked
of
rights
of
suppliants
and
the
inviolable
nature
of
asylums
at
all
weaken
the
argument
that
has
been
advanced
for
the
advantages
of
such
protection
are
designed
only
for
those
who
are
the
victims
of
unmerited
persecution
not
for
those
who
have
committed
crimes
injurious
to
mankind
and
destructive
to
society
gylippus
the
lacedaemonian
as
may
be
seen
in
the
xiii
book
of
diodorus
siculus
speaking
of
the
rights
of
suppliants
says
that
they
were
originally
introduced
as
measures
of
compassion
to
the
unfortunate
and
not
a
screen
for
malicious
and
wanton
offenders
who
have
nothing
but
punishment
to
expect
and
a
little
after
he
says
when
such
men
prompted
by
malice
or
rapacity
have
plunged
into
evils
they
have
no
right
to
talk
of
misfortune
or
to
wear
the
name
of
suppliants
for
that
is
a
privilege
granted
by
the
laws
of
nature
to
the
innocent
who
are
beaten
down
by
the
hard
and
oppressive
strokes
of
ill
fortune
but
the
refuge
of
compassion
is
withheld
where
every
line
of
a
life
has
been
marked
with
cruelty
and
injustice
thus
according
to
that
law
which
partakes
of
the
wisdom
of
its
divine
author
asylums
were
open
to
those
who
had
killed
any
one
by
a
weapon
escaping
from
their
hand
slaves
too
were
allowed
places
of
refuge
but
deliberate
murderers
or
those
who
had
disturbed
the
peaceful
order
of
the
state
found
no
protection
even
from
the
altar
of
god
philo
in
explaining
this
law
says
that
even
the
temple
affords
no
refuge
to
the
impious
the
more
ancient
of
the
greeks
acted
upon
the
same
principle
it
is
said
that
the
chalcidians
refused
to
deliver
up
nauplius
to
the
grecians
and
the
reason
alleged
was
his
having
cleared
himself
of
the
charges
made
against
him
there
was
among
the
athenians
an
altar
dedicated
to
mercy
it
is
mentioned
by
cicero
pausanias
servius
and
also
by
theophilus
and
it
is
described
at
full
length
by
statius
in
the
xii
book
of
his
thebais
the
poet
explains
to
what
description
of
men
it
afforded
shelter
it
was
he
says
to
those
who
were
driven
from
their
homes
by
the
calamity
of
war
or
stripped
of
their
kingdoms
by
usurpers
tacitus
in
the
third
book
of
his
annals
and
chapter
reprobates
the
custom
prevailing
in
his
time
among
the
cities
of
greece
of
making
it
an
act
of
religion
to
protect
offenders
from
the
punishment
due
to
their
crimes
such
offenders
therefore
ought
either
to
be
punished
or
delivered
up
or
at
least
ordered
to
withdraw
perseus
the
macedonian
king
clearing
himself
to
martius
from
the
charge
of
screening
those
who
had
attempted
the
life
of
eumenes
said
as
soon
as
i
was
apprised
by
you
of
their
being
in
macedonia
i
ordered
immediate
search
to
be
made
for
them
peremptorily
commanding
their
perpetual
banishment
from
my
kingdom
the
right
of
demanding
the
surrender
or
punishment
of
criminals
that
have
fled
into
other
kingdoms
has
in
most
parts
of
europe
during
the
present
and
the
immediately
preceding
centuries
been
generally
exercised
in
cases
where
the
crimes
were
such
as
affected
the
safety
of
the
state
or
were
attended
with
notorious
atrocity
it
has
been
usual
to
pass
over
with
mutual
connivance
crimes
of
an
inferior
kind
except
where
it
has
been
agreed
to
the
contrary
by
express
treaty
nor
can
it
be
concealed
that
where
robbers
and
pirates
have
gained
a
truly
formidable
power
it
has
often
been
deemed
an
act
of
humane
policy
both
in
sovereign
princes
and
states
to
exercise
forbearance
towards
them
rather
than
to
drive
them
to
greater
acts
of
desperation
by
treating
them
with
all
the
rigour
which
they
deserve
vi
if
the
act
of
which
refugees
and
suppliants
are
accused
is
not
prohibited
by
the
law
of
nature
or
of
nations
the
matter
must
be
decided
by
the
civil
law
of
the
country
from
which
they
come
this
was
a
received
opinion
in
ancient
times
as
we
find
from
the
language
of
aeschylus
in
whose
tragedy
of
the
suppliants
the
king
of
argos
addressing
a
number
of
the
daughters
of
danaus
on
their
coming
from
egypt
says
if
the
sons
of
egypt
exercise
controul
over
you
maintaining
that
they
are
authorised
to
do
so
by
the
law
of
the
state
as
being
the
nearest
allied
by
blood
who
can
resist
them
it
is
for
you
to
prove
that
according
to
the
laws
of
your
country
they
have
no
authority
over
you
vii
and
viii
it
has
often
been
a
celebrated
topic
of
discussion
whether
a
whole
community
can
be
punished
for
misconduct
and
this
is
the
proper
place
for
that
inquiry
it
was
shewn
in
a
former
part
of
this
treatise
that
a
body
politic
though
it
may
seem
to
vary
by
a
succession
of
new
members
continues
the
same
as
long
as
it
retains
its
form
in
which
case
it
seems
liable
to
punishment
no
less
than
individuals
on
the
other
hand
bodies
politic
seem
to
possess
many
privileges
peculiar
to
themselves
such
as
having
a
common
treasury
a
common
seal
laws
and
other
similar
advantages
but
there
are
some
distinctions
which
they
particularly
derive
from
the
individuals
of
which
they
are
composed
thus
we
say
that
universities
are
learned
or
garrisons
brave
according
to
the
number
of
learned
or
gallant
men
which
they
respectively
contain
merit
is
a
distinction
of
this
kind
as
being
a
gift
of
nature
to
individuals
or
an
individual
acquirement
which
no
public
body
of
itself
can
have
so
that
upon
the
death
or
departure
of
those
meritorious
individuals
the
degree
of
merit
which
any
public
society
derived
from
their
presence
must
become
extinct
in
the
same
manner
the
debt
of
punishment
which
is
considered
as
arising
from
some
act
of
demerit
must
cease
with
the
debt
of
the
individual
delinquents
arrian
is
justly
commended
for
censuring
the
vengeance
retorted
upon
the
persians
by
alexander
at
a
time
when
those
who
had
committed
the
original
aggressions
on
the
greeks
had
long
been
laid
in
their
graves
he
passes
a
like
sentence
upon
the
burning
of
persepolis
as
a
retaliation
for
what
the
persians
had
done
at
athens
such
acts
of
retaliation
after
a
lapse
of
years
have
been
vindicated
by
some
writers
as
an
imitation
of
the
slow
but
unerring
progress
of
divine
justice
but
we
must
remember
that
the
ways
of
god
are
not
as
our
ways
nor
is
the
exercise
of
his
justice
to
be
measured
by
our
counsels
for
if
descendents
can
claim
no
merit
for
the
actions
of
their
forefathers
neither
is
it
right
they
should
be
punished
for
their
transgressions
the
consequences
of
merit
indeed
may
be
transmitted
without
injury
and
therefore
without
injustice
but
it
is
not
so
with
punishments
ix
having
thus
shewn
that
a
communication
of
punishment
is
necessarily
connected
with
a
participation
in
guilt
it
remains
to
consider
whether
punishment
can
be
extended
to
those
who
are
no
way
concerned
in
the
crime
in
order
to
understand
this
clearly
and
to
prevent
the
mistakes
that
may
arise
from
a
similarity
of
expression
where
there
is
no
similarity
of
facts
it
will
be
necessary
to
make
use
of
some
precautions
x
in
the
first
place
there
is
a
difference
between
a
loss
directly
occasioned
by
any
act
and
one
resulting
but
indirectly
from
it
now
it
may
be
called
a
direct
injury
to
deprive
any
one
of
what
peculiarly
belongs
to
him
as
his
right
an
indirect
injury
is
that
which
prevents
any
one
from
possessing
what
he
otherwise
would
have
done
by
destroying
the
condition
or
means
which
gave
him
such
a
right
as
an
example
ulpian
says
if
any
one
has
opened
a
well
in
his
own
ground
by
which
the
subterraneous
streams
of
water
that
would
have
passed
to
the
lands
of
another
are
cut
off
here
no
fault
is
imputable
to
the
person
who
has
only
exercised
his
own
right
and
in
another
place
he
says
it
makes
a
great
difference
whether
any
one
directly
does
an
injury
or
is
only
indirectly
and
unintentionally
instrumental
in
preventing
another
from
reaping
advantages
which
he
would
otherwise
have
enjoyed
and
it
is
absurd
says
paulus
another
legal
authority
for
men
to
be
called
rich
before
they
possess
the
means
of
being
so
thus
when
the
property
of
parents
is
forfeited
it
is
felt
as
an
inconvenience
by
their
children
though
it
can
not
be
considered
as
a
direct
punishment
inflicted
upon
them
because
that
property
would
never
have
been
theirs
unless
the
parents
had
retained
it
to
their
last
breath
on
which
alphenus
has
made
a
just
observation
in
saying
that
by
the
punishment
of
the
father
children
lose
that
which
would
have
come
to
them
from
him
but
things
which
they
do
not
receive
from
him
such
as
the
gifts
of
nature
or
those
derived
from
any
other
quarter
remain
untouched
cicero
relates
that
in
this
manner
the
children
of
themistocles
were
reduced
to
want
nor
does
he
think
it
unjust
that
the
children
of
lepidus
should
share
the
same
fate
and
he
says
that
it
is
an
ancient
custom
and
the
received
usage
of
all
states
the
hardship
of
which
nevertheless
was
greatly
softened
by
the
laws
of
rome
at
a
later
period
thus
when
a
whole
people
is
implicated
in
the
misconduct
of
the
majority
which
holds
the
representative
character
of
the
state
and
consequently
loses
its
civil
liberties
its
fortifications
and
other
privileges
the
loss
affects
innocent
individuals
but
only
in
those
things
which
they
could
not
have
enjoyed
except
as
belonging
to
that
community
xi
besides
we
must
observe
that
the
offence
of
one
man
may
sometimes
occasion
inconvenience
or
loss
to
another
and
yet
that
offence
may
not
be
considered
as
the
immediate
cause
of
the
action
which
is
grounded
on
the
exercise
of
a
right
this
may
be
explained
by
an
example
thus
if
any
one
has
engaged
for
another
debt
he
brings
himself
into
the
dilemma
named
in
the
ancient
proverb
that
being
bound
for
any
one
is
the
next
stage
to
ruin
but
it
is
a
man
own
promise
and
not
another
having
incurred
a
debt
that
is
the
real
cause
of
his
obligation
for
as
a
person
who
has
given
security
for
a
purchaser
is
not
properly
speaking
bound
by
the
purchase
but
by
his
own
promise
so
if
any
one
has
engaged
to
be
responsible
for
a
delinquent
it
is
his
own
engagement
and
not
the
act
of
that
delinquent
which
creates
his
obligation
and
hence
the
inconvenience
of
that
kind
which
any
one
incurs
must
be
measured
not
by
the
delinquency
of
another
but
by
his
own
power
to
enter
into
any
such
voluntary
engagement
in
consequence
of
which
no
one
can
give
surety
to
suffer
death
for
another
because
no
one
has
such
power
over
his
own
life
as
to
take
it
away
himself
or
to
be
bound
to
forfeit
it
for
another
though
the
ancient
greeks
and
romans
thought
otherwise
and
therefore
they
maintained
that
a
surety
might
be
put
to
death
for
any
one
as
may
be
seen
in
the
well
known
story
of
damon
and
pythias
and
hostages
were
frequently
punished
in
this
manner
what
has
been
said
of
life
may
be
applied
to
the
limbs
also
which
no
man
has
a
right
to
part
with
except
for
the
preservation
of
the
whole
body
but
if
any
one
has
engaged
to
suffer
banishment
to
submit
to
a
pecuniary
fine
or
any
other
means
of
satisfying
justice
any
thing
he
suffers
on
this
account
will
not
strictly
speaking
be
considered
as
a
personal
punishment
but
as
the
performance
of
an
agreement
something
like
this
occurs
in
the
right
which
any
one
possesses
dependent
on
another
will
both
with
respect
to
the
right
of
individuals
to
private
property
and
to
the
more
extensive
right
to
demesnes
possessed
by
a
state
for
if
any
one
is
deprived
of
such
a
thing
owing
to
another
fault
here
the
executive
power
depriving
that
person
is
not
inflicting
a
punishment
on
him
but
only
exercising
a
prior
right
xii
and
xiii
having
laid
down
these
distinctions
we
may
observe
that
it
is
impossible
that
an
innocent
person
should
suffer
for
crime
this
does
not
proceed
from
the
reasons
given
by
paulus
who
maintains
that
punishment
is
designed
for
the
reformation
of
the
offender
for
it
seems
possible
that
an
example
may
be
made
extending
beyond
the
person
of
the
criminal
himself
when
it
affects
in
its
consequences
those
who
are
nearly
related
to
him
so
that
it
is
not
for
the
sake
of
example
only
that
punishment
is
inflicted
but
because
the
obligation
thereto
arises
from
the
demerit
of
the
offending
party
now
every
demerit
must
be
of
a
personal
nature
as
it
proceeds
from
a
man
own
will
over
which
he
is
supposed
to
exercise
a
perfect
controul
xiv
in
the
law
given
to
the
hebrews
god
threatens
to
avenge
the
impiety
of
fathers
upon
their
children
but
he
has
sovereign
dominion
over
our
lives
and
substance
as
being
his
gift
which
he
may
take
away
from
any
one
whenever
he
pleases
without
assigning
his
reasons
therefore
if
he
thinks
proper
to
take
away
by
a
premature
or
violent
death
the
children
of
achan
saul
jeroboam
or
ahab
he
is
exercising
over
them
the
right
of
sovereignty
as
well
as
that
of
punishment
imposing
by
that
awful
example
the
more
severe
penalty
upon
the
parents
for
if
they
survive
their
children
which
was
what
the
divine
law
had
most
in
view
and
therefore
did
not
extend
these
threats
beyond
the
time
of
great
a
period
to
which
the
age
of
man
might
reach
it
is
certain
that
parents
would
be
severely
punished
by
such
a
sight
the
most
afflicting
of
any
they
could
witness
or
if
they
should
not
survive
such
an
event
to
die
under
such
an
apprehension
would
be
a
great
calamity
but
it
is
proper
to
remark
that
examples
like
those
are
never
employed
by
god
except
against
crimes
affecting
his
divine
majesty
as
false
worship
perjury
or
sacrilege
indeed
those
threats
of
divine
vengeance
are
not
always
enforced
especially
where
any
extraordinary
virtue
shines
in
the
characters
and
conduct
of
the
children
as
may
be
seen
in
the
xviii
chapter
of
the
prophesy
of
ezekiel
plutarch
has
discussed
this
topic
with
great
eloquence
in
his
book
on
the
remote
vengeance
of
god
as
the
gospel
so
clearly
unfolds
the
future
punishments
of
the
wicked
all
the
threats
contained
in
that
new
covenant
terminate
in
the
persons
of
the
offenders
themselves
but
the
ways
of
providence
in
these
respects
are
not
the
rule
which
men
can
follow
for
god
even
without
any
reference
to
crime
is
the
sovereign
lord
and
disposer
of
human
life
a
commission
which
man
is
only
allowed
to
execute
against
the
perpetrators
of
certain
crimes
wherefore
as
that
same
divine
law
forbids
parents
to
be
put
to
death
for
the
offences
of
children
so
it
exempts
children
from
the
same
punishment
for
the
actions
of
their
fathers
a
lenity
which
is
greatly
commended
by
josephus
and
philo
the
same
commendation
is
bestowed
by
isocrates
upon
the
laws
of
egypt
and
by
dionysius
of
halicarnassus
upon
those
of
rome
xv
but
if
it
is
unjust
in
human
laws
to
punish
the
misconduct
of
parents
in
the
persons
of
their
children
how
much
more
severe
was
the
law
of
the
persians
and
macedonians
extending
the
penalties
for
crimes
against
the
state
to
every
branch
of
the
offender
relatives
in
the
most
remote
degree
a
law
surpassing
all
others
in
rigour
xvi
xvii
and
xviii
what
has
been
said
respecting
the
punishment
of
children
for
the
offences
of
their
fathers
or
forefathers
may
be
applied
to
the
relation
subsisting
between
sovereigns
and
subjects
for
it
is
a
relation
springing
from
the
contract
of
society
which
makes
the
sovereign
the
essential
head
life
and
soul
of
that
body
in
which
his
people
form
the
members
as
the
civil
community
therefore
with
its
sovereign
or
head
forms
but
one
body
there
can
be
no
separation
of
interests
but
what
affects
one
part
must
be
prejudicial
or
serviceable
to
the
whole
xix
why
should
an
heir
it
has
been
sometimes
asked
be
bound
by
other
debts
of
his
ancestor
and
not
feel
the
effects
of
his
punishment
for
misconduct
to
which
answer
may
be
given
that
the
heir
represents
the
person
of
the
deceased
not
in
his
merits
or
demerits
which
are
purely
personal
but
in
his
property
an
artificial
mode
of
preserving
unbroken
the
chain
of
succession
and
descent
xx
and
hence
it
follows
that
if
in
addition
to
the
demerit
of
an
offence
any
new
grounds
of
obligation
should
arise
connected
with
the
punishment
they
must
be
discharged
not
properly
as
a
punishment
but
as
a
debt
thus
the
heir
will
be
liable
to
pay
the
costs
awarded
by
a
judgment
after
a
contested
suit
which
is
considered

the
light
of

i
in
a
former
part
of
this
work
where
the
justice
of
war
was
discussed
it
was
observed
that
some
wars
were
founded
upon
real
motives
and
others
only
upon
colourable
pretexts
this
distinction
was
first
noticed
by
polybius
who
calls
the
pretexts
προφασεις
prophaseis
and
the
real
causes
αἰτιας
aitias
thus
alexander
made
war
upon
darius
under
the
pretence
of
avenging
the
former
wrongs
done
by
the
persians
to
the
greeks
but
the
real
motive
of
that
bold
and
enterprising
hero
was
the
easy
acquisition
of
wealth
and
dominion
which
the
expeditions
of
xenophon
and
agesilaus
had
opened
to
his
view
in
the
same
manner
a
dispute
about
saguntum
furnished
the
carthaginians
with
colourable
motives
for
the
second
punic
war
but
in
reality
they
could
not
brook
the
indignity
of
having
consented
to
a
treaty
which
the
romans
had
extorted
from
them
at
an
unfavourable
moment
and
more
especially
as
their
spirits
were
revived
by
their
recent
successes
in
spain
the
real
causes
assigned
by
thucydides
for
the
peloponnesian
war
were
the
jealousies
entertained
by
the
lacedaemonians
of
the
then
growing
power
of
the
athenians
though
the
quarrels
of
the
corcyreans
potidaens
and
other
secondary
states
were
made
the
ostensible
reasons
ii
there
are
some
who
have
neither
ostensible
reasons
nor
just
causes
to
plead
for
their
hostilities
in
which
as
tacitus
says
they
engage
from
the
pure
love
of
enterprise
and
danger
a
disposition
to
which
aristotle
gives
the
name
of
ferocity
and
in
the
last
book
of
his
nicomachean
ethics
he
calls
it
a
bloody
cruelty
to
convert
friends
into
enemies
whom
you
may
slaughter
iii
though
most
powers
when
engaging
in
war
are
desirous
to
colour
over
their
real
motives
with
justifiable
pretexts
yet
some
totally
disregarding
such
methods
of
vindication
seem
able
to
give
no
better
reason
for
their
conduct
than
what
is
told
by
the
roman
lawyers
of
a
robber
who
being
asked
what
right
he
had
to
a
thing
which
he
had
seized
replied
it
was
his
own
because
he
had
taken
it
into
his
possession
aristotle
in
the
third
book
of
his
rhetoric
speaking
of
the
promoters
of
war
asks
if
it
is
not
unjust
for
a
neighbouring
people
to
be
enslaved
and
if
those
promoters
have
no
regard
to
the
rights
of
unoffending
nations
cicero
in
the
first
book
of
his
offices
speaks
in
the
same
strain
and
calls
the
courage
which
is
conspicuous
in
danger
and
enterprise
if
devoid
of
justice
absolutely
undeserving
of
the
name
of
valour
it
should
rather
be
considered
as
a
brutal
fierceness
outraging
every
principle
of
humanity
iv
others
make
use
of
pretexts
which
though
plausible
at
first
sight
will
not
bear
the
examination
and
test
of
moral
rectitude
and
when
stripped
of
their
disguise
such
pretexts
will
be
found
fraught
with
injustice
in
such
hostilities
says
livy
it
is
not
a
trial
of
right
but
some
object
of
secret
and
unruly
ambition
which
acts
as
the
chief
spring
most
powers
it
is
said
by
plutarch
employ
the
relative
situations
of
peace
and
war
as
a
current
specie
for
the
purchase
of
whatever
they
deem
expedient
by
having
before
examined
and
established
the
principles
of
just
and
necessary
war
we
may
form
a
better
idea
of
what
goes
to
constitute
the
injustice
of
the
same
as
the
nature
of
things
is
best
seen
by
contrast
and
we
judge
of
what
is
crooked
by
comparing
it
with
what
is
straight
but
for
the
sake
of
perspicuity
it
will
be
necessary
to
treat
upon
the
leading
points
it
was
shewn
above
that
apprehensions
from
a
neighbouring
power
are
not
a
sufficient
ground
for
war
for
to
authorize
hostilities
as
a
defensive
measure
they
must
arise
from
the
necessity
which
just
apprehensions
create
apprehensions
not
only
of
the
power
but
of
the
intentions
of
a
formidable
state
and
such
apprehensions
as
amount
to
a
moral
certainty
for
which
reason
the
opinion
of
those
is
by
no
means
to
be
approved
of
who
lay
down
as
a
just
ground
of
war
the
construction
of
fortifications
in
a
neighbouring
country
with
whom
there
is
no
existing
treaty
to
prohibit
such
constructions
or
the
securing
of
a
strong
hold
which
may
at
some
future
period
prove
a
means
of
annoyance
for
as
a
guard
against
such
apprehensions
every
power
may
construct
in
its
own
territory
strong
works
and
other
military
securities
of
the
same
kind
without
having
recourse
to
actual
war
one
can
not
but
admire
the
character
which
tacitus
has
drawn
of
the
chauci
a
noble
and
people
of
germany
who
were
desirous
of
maintaining
their
greatness
by
justice
rather
than
by
acts
of
ungovernable
rapacity
and
ambition
provoking
no
wars
invading
no
countries
spoiling
no
neighbours
to
aggrandize
themselves
yet
when
necessity
prompted
able
to
raise
men
with
arms
in
their
hands
at
a
moment
warning
a
great
population
with
a
numerous
breed
of
horses
to
form
a
well
mounted
cavalry
and
with
all
these
advantages
upholding
their
reputation
in
the
midst
of
peace
vi
nor
can
the
advantage
to
be
gained
by
a
war
be
ever
pleaded
as
a
motive
of
equal
weight
and
justice
with
necessity
vii
and
viii
neither
can
the
desire
of
emigrating
to
a
more
favourable
soil
and
climate
justify
an
attack
upon
a
neighbouring
power
this
as
we
are
informed
by
tacitus
was
a
frequent
cause
of
war
among
the
ancient
germans
ix
there
is
no
less
injustice
in
setting
up
claims
under
the
pretence
of
newly
discovered
titles
to
what
belongs
to
another
neither
can
the
wickedness
and
impiety
nor
any
other
incapacity
of
the
original
owner
justify
such
a
claim
for
the
title
and
right
by
discovery
can
apply
only
to
countries
and
places
that
have
no
owner
x
neither
moral
nor
religious
virtue
nor
any
intellectual
excellence
is
requisite
to
form
a
good
title
to
property
only
where
a
race
of
men
is
so
destitute
of
reason
as
to
be
incapable
of
exercising
any
act
of
ownership
they
can
hold
no
property
nor
will
the
law
of
charity
require
that
they
should
have
more
than
the
necessaries
of
life
for
the
rules
of
the
law
of
nations
can
only
be
applied
to
those
who
are
capable
of
political
or
commercial
intercourse
but
not
to
a
people
entirely
destitute
of
reason
though
it
is
a
matter
of
just
doubt
whether
any
such
is
to
be
found
it
was
an
absurdity
therefore
in
the
greeks
to
suppose
that
difference
of
manners
or
inferiority
of
intellect
made
those
whom
they
were
pleased
to
call
barbarians
their
natural
enemies
but
as
to
atrocious
crimes
striking
at
the
very
root
and
existence
of
society
the
forfeiture
of
property
ensuing
from
thence
is
a
question
of
a
different
nature
belonging
to
punishments
under
the
head
of
which
it
was
discussed
xi
but
neither
the
independence
of
individuals
nor
that
of
states
is
a
motive
that
can
at
all
times
justify
recourse
to
arms
as
if
all
persons
indiscriminately
had
a
natural
right
to
do
so
for
where
liberty
is
said
to
be
a
natural
right
belonging
to
all
men
and
states
by
that
expression
is
understood
a
right
of
nature
antecedent
to
every
human
obligation
or
contract
but
in
that
case
liberty
is
spoken
of
in
a
negative
sense
and
not
by
way
of
contrast
to
independence
the
meaning
of
which
is
that
no
one
is
by
the
law
of
nature
doomed
to
servitude
though
he
is
not
forbidden
by
that
law
to
enter
into
such
a
condition
for
in
this
sense
no
one
can
be
called
free
if
nature
leaves
him
not
the
privilege
of
chusing
his
own
condition
as
albutius
pertinently
remarks
the
terms
freedom
and
servitude
are
not
founded
in
the
principles
of
nature
but
are
names
subsequently
applied
to
men
according
to
the
dispositions
of
fortune
and
aristotle
defines
the
relations
of
master
and
servant
to
be
the
result
of
political
and
not
of
natural
appointment
whenever
therefore
the
condition
of
servitude
either
personal
or
political
subsists
from
lawful
causes
men
should
be
contented
with
that
state
according
to
the
injunction
of
the
apostle
art
thou
called
being
a
servant
let
not
that
be
an
anxious
concern
xii
and
there
is
equal
injustice
in
the
desire
of
reducing
by
force
of
arms
any
people
to
a
state
of
servitude
under
the
pretext
of
its
being
the
condition
for
which
they
are
best
qualified
by
nature
it
does
not
follow
that
because
any
one
is
fitted
for
a
particular
condition
another
has
a
right
to
impose
it
upon
him
for
every
reasonable
creature
ought
to
be
left
free
in
the
choice
of
what
may
be
deemed
useful
or
prejudicial
to
him
provided
another
has
no
just
right
to
a
controul
over
him
the
case
of
children
has
no
connection
with
the
question
as
they
are
necessarily
under
the
discipline
of
others
xiii
it
would
scarce
have
been
necessary
to
refute
the
foolish
opinion
of
some
who
have
ascribed
to
the
roman
emperors
dominion
over
the
most
remote
and
unknown
nations
if
bartolus
deemed
a
lawyer
of
the
first
eminence
had
not
pronounced
it
heresy
to
deny
those
pretensions
this
opinion
has
been
built
upon
the
roman
emperor
some
times
having
styled
himself
sovereign
of
the
whole
world
a
term
which
it
was
not
unusual
for
many
people
to
apply
to
their
own
country
thus
in
the
scriptures
we
find
judea
frequently
called
the
whole
inhabited
earth
therefore
when
the
jews
in
their
proverbial
expression
called
jerusalem
the
centre
of
the
world
nothing
more
is
to
be
implied
than
that
it
was
situated
in
the
middle
of
judea
as
to
the
argument
in
favor
of
universal
dominion
from
its
being
so
beneficial
to
mankind
it
may
be
observed
that
all
its
advantages
are
counterbalanced
by
still
greater
disadvantages
for
as
a
ship
may
be
built
too
large
to
be
conveniently
managed
so
an
empire
may
be
too
extensive
in
population
and
territory
to
be
directed
and
governed
by
one
head
but
granting
the
expediency
of
universal
empire
that
expediency
can
not
give
such
a
right
as
can
be
acquired
only
by
treaty
or
conquest
there
were
many
places
formerly
belonging
to
the
roman
empire
over
which
the
emperor
has
at
present
no
controul
for
war
treaty
or
cession
have
made
many
changes
by
which
the
rights
of
territory
have
passed
to
other
states
or
sovereign
princes
and
the
standards
of
different
communities
whether
kingdoms
or
commonwealths
now
wave
in
places
which
the
roman
eagle
once
overshadowed
with
his
wings
these
are
losses
and
changes
that
have
been
experienced
by
other
powers
no
less
than
that
which
was
once
mistress
of
the
world
xiv
but
there
have
been
some
who
have
asserted
the
rights
of
the
church
over
unknown
parts
of
the
world
though
the
apostle
paul
himself
has
expressly
said
that
christians
were
not
to
judge
those
who
were
without
the
pale
of
their
own
community
and
though
the
right
of
judging
which
belonged
to
the
apostles
might
in
some
cases
apply
to
worldly
concerns
yet
in
its
general
nature
it
was
of
a
celestial
rather
than
an
earthly
kind
a
judgment
not
exercised
by
fire
and
sword
but
by
the
word
of
god
proposed
to
all
men
and
adapted
to
their
peculiar
circumstances
a
judgment
exercised
by
displaying
or
withholding
the
seals
of
divine
grace
as
it
might
be
most
expedient
lastly
it
was
a
judgment
exercised
in
supernatural
punishments
in
punishments
proceeding
from
god
like
the
punishments
of
ananias
elymas
hymenaeus
and
others
christ

spring
from
whence
all
the
power
of
the
church
was
derived

whose
life
is
the
model
for
the
church
to
follow
said
his
kingdom
was
not
of
this

that

not
of
the
same
nature
with
other

otherwise
like
the
rest

authority
by

for

had
pleased
to
call

the

of
legions
he
would
have
called
up
hosts
of
angels
and
not
of
men
and
every
exercise
of
his
right
was
performed
by
the
influence
of
divine
and
not
of
human
power
even
when
he
drove
the
sellers
out
of
the
temple
for
the
rod
was
the
emblem
and
not
the
instrument
of
divine
wrath

once
a
sign
of

and

the

in
that
calamity
his
fear
shewed
itself
in
cruel
wrath
but
my
kingdom
says
christ
is
not
of
this
world
therefore
enter
this
kingdom
without
fear
come
with
faith
and
provoke
not
the
king
to
anger
by
your
delay
xv
there
is
a
caution
too
necessary
to
be
given
against
drawing
too
close
a
parallel
between
ancient
and
modern
times
for
it
is
but
seldom
that
any
one
can
adduce
a
case
exactly
conformable
to
his
own
circumstances
to
draw
such
pretexts
from
the
interpretation
of
prophecy
is
the
highest
presumption
for
no
prophecy
that
is
yet
to
be
fulfilled
can
be
unfolded
without
the
aid
of
a
prophetic
spirit
the
times
even
of
events
that
are
certain
may
escape
our
notice
nor
is
it
every
prediction
unless
it
be
accompanied
with
an
express
command
from
god
that
can
justify
recourse
to
arms
sometimes
indeed
god
brings
his
predicted
designs
to
their
issue
by
the
means
of
wicked
instruments
xvi
as
the
imperfect
obligations
of
charity
and
other
virtues
of
the
same
kind
are
not
cognizable
in
a
court
of
justice
so
neither
can
the
performance
of
them
be
compelled
by
force
of
arms
for
it
is
not
the
moral
nature
of
a
duty
that
can
enforce
its
fulfillment
but
there
must
be
some
legal
right
in
one
of
the
parties
to
exact
the
obligation
for
the
moral
obligation
receives
an
additional
weight
from
such
a
right
this
obligation
therefore
must
be
united
to
the
former
to
give
a
war
the
character
of
a
just
war
thus
a
person
who
has
conferred
a
favour
has
not
strictly
speaking
a
right
to
demand
a
return
for
that
would
be
converting
an
act
of
kindness
into
a
contract
xvii
it
is
necessary
to
observe
that
a
war
may
be
just
in
its
origin
and
yet
the
intentions
of
its
authors
may
become
unjust
in
the
course
of
its
prosecution
for
some
other
motive
not
unlawful
in
itself
may
actuate
them
more
powerfully
than
the
original
right
for
the
attainment
of
which
the
war
was
begun
it
is
laudable
for
instance
to
maintain
national
honour
it
is
laudable
to
pursue
a
public
or
a
private
interest
and
yet
those
objects
may
not
form
the
justifiable
grounds
of
the
war
in
question
a
war
may
gradually
change
its
nature
and
its
object
from
the
prosecution
of
a
right
to
the
desire
of
seconding
or
supporting
the
aggrandizement
of
some
other
power
but
such
motives
though
blamable
when
even
connected
with
a
just
war
do
not
render
the
war
itself
unjust
nor
invalidate
its
conquests

i
there
is
much
truth
in
aristotle
observation
that
moral
reasonings
can
never
amount
to
the
certainty
of
mathematical
demonstration
because
in
mathematical
reasoning
all
the
figures
are
considered
in
the
abstract
purely
by
themselves
and
without
relation
to
the
circumstances
of
time
or
place
so
that
there
is
nothing
to
warp
the
judgment
from
the
object
immediately
under
consideration
besides
the
figures
in
general
form
a
direct
contrast
to
each
other
thus
for
instance
there
is
no
intermediate
line
between
a
straight
line
and
a
curve
but
it
is
not
so
in
morals
where
the
least
circumstances
vary
the
subject
and
admit
a
latitude
of
interpretation
settling
the
points
of
truth
and
justice
between
two
extremes
so
that
between
what
is
right
and
what
is
unlawful
there
is
a
middle
space
where
it
is
easy
to
incline
to
the
one
side
or
to
the
other
this
occasions
an
ambiguity
somewhat
like
the
difficulty
of
deciding
the
precise
moment
where
the
twilight
begins
and
where
it
ends
from
hence
aristotle
concludes
that
it
is
sometimes
difficult
to
determine
between
two
extremes
what
line
of
conduct
ought
to
be
chosen
or
rejected
ii
but
it
must
be
laid
down
as
a
necessary
principle
that
although
an
action
may
in
reality
be
just
yet
if
the
party
doing
it
after
weighing
every
circumstance
can
not
reconcile
the
act
to
his
conscience
he
incurs
some
degree
of
guilt
for
whatever
is
not
of
faith
the
is
sin
where
by
the
term
faith
he
means
a
deliberate
judgment
of
the
mind
for
god
has
given
conscience
a
judicial
power
to
be
the
sovereign
guide
of
human
actions
by
despising
whose
admonitions
the
mind
is
stupified
into
brutal
hardness
for
it
often
happens
that
judgment
can
point
out
nothing
certain
but
hesitates
and
when
such
doubts
and
hesitations
can
not
satisfactorily
be
cleared
up
the
rule
of
cicero
is
a
safe
one
to
follow
who
says
that
it
is
an
excellent
injunction
which
forbids
us
to
do
a
thing
of
the
rectitude
or
impropriety
of
which
we
entertain
a
doubt
but
this
rule
can
not
be
applied
where
of
two
things
in
the
choice
of
which
there
is
equal
doubt
the
one
must
be
done
in
which
case
that
must
be
selected
which
seems
to
be
the
least
unjust
for
on
all
occasions
where
a
choice
can
not
be
avoided
the
less
of
two
evils
assumes
the
appearance
of
a
virtue
iii
but
in
doubtful
cases
after
examination
the
mind
seldom
remains
neuter
but
inclines
to
one
side
or
the
other
persuaded
either
by
the
merits
of
the
case
or
by
respect
for
the
judgment
of
those
who
have
delivered
an
opinion
upon
the
question
now
the
merits
of
the
case
are
derived
either
from
the
causes
the
effects
or
other
concomitant
circumstances
iv
to
apprehend
such
distinctions
properly
practice
and
penetration
are
necessary
and
where
men
have
not
in
themselves
a
capacity
for
the
active
exercise
of
judgment
it
behoves
them
to
follow
the
maxims
of
others
who
are
distinguished
by
their
wisdom
and
experience
for
in
the
opinion
of
aristotle
those
things
are
probably
just
or
true
which
seem
so
to
all
or
to
the
greater
part
of
men
of
worth
and
this
is
the
method
of
judging
pursued
by
sovereign
princes
whose
engagements
in
the
affairs
of
life
allow
them
but
little
leisure
for
study
and
deliberation
thus
the
ancient
romans
never
undertook
wars
till
they
had
consulted
the
sacred
college
established
for
that
purpose
and
the
christian
emperors
scarcely
ever
did
so
without
advising
with
the
bishops
in
order
to
be
apprized
of
any
thing
therein
that
might
affect
religion
it
may
happen
in
many
disputed
points
that
the
intrinsic
merits
of
the
case
or
the
opinions
of
the
learned
are
equal
on
both
sides
when
that
happens
if
the
matters
in
discussion
are
of
no
great
importance
there
is
nothing
to
blame
in
the
person
that
makes
his
choice
either
way
but
in
matters
of
moment
where
the
lives
of
men
are
at
stake
the
decision
should
incline
to
the
safer
side
according
to
the
proverbial
maxim
which
pronounces
it
better
to
acquit
the
guilty
than
to
condemn
the
innocent
vi
war
then
being
an
object
of
such
weighty
magnitude
in
which
the
innocent
must
often
be
involved
in
the
sufferings
of
the
guilty
between
wavering
opinions
the
balance
should
incline
in
favour
of
peace
there
are
three
methods
by
which
independent
nations
may
settle
their
disputed
rights
without
coming
to
the
decision
of
the
sword
vii
the
first
method
is
that
of
conference
for
in
the
words
of
cicero
there
being
two
methods
of
deciding
quarrels
the
one
by
discussion
and
the
other
by
force
the
former
a
peculiar
characteristic
of
man
and
the
latter
of
the
brute
creation
when
the
first
of
these
methods
fails
men
are
obliged
to
have
recourse
to
the
latter
mardonius
in
the
polyhymnia
of
herodotus
blames
the
grecians
who
being
united
in
one
language
might
settle
their
quarrels
by
messengers
of
peace
by
heralds
and
negotiations
rather
than
by
war
viii
the
other
method
is
that
of
compromise
which
takes
place
between
those
who
have
no
common
judge
among
innumerable
instances
of
this
kind
in
ancient
history
we
may
select
that
given
by
xenophon
in
his
account
of
cyrus
where
that
prince
takes
the
king
of
the
indians
for
arbitrator
between
himself
and
the
king
of
assyria
the
carthaginians
in
their
disputes
with
masinissa
prefer
a
settlement
of
this
kind
before
a
decision
of
war
livy
too
informs
us
that
the
romans
themselves
in
a
dispute
with
the
samnites
made
an
appeal
to
the
common
allies
of
both
the
office
of
deciding
wars
and
putting
an
end
to
the
contentions
of
armies
was
assigned
according
to
strabo
to
the
druids
of
the
gauls
and
upon
the
testimony
of
the
same
writer
it
formed
a
part
of
the
priestly
functions
among
the
iberians
surely
then
it
is
a
mode
of
terminating
their
disputes
balancing
their
powers
and
settling
their
pretensions
worthy
to
be
adopted
by
christian
kings
and
states
for
if
in
order
to
avoid
trials
before
judges
who
were
strangers
to
the
true
religion
the
jews
and
christians
appointed
arbitrators
of
their
own
and
it
was
a
practice
recommended
and
enjoined
by
paul
how
much
more
ought
such
a
practice
to
be
recommended
and
enforced
to
gain
the
still
nobler
end
of
preventing
the
calamities
of
war
these
and
many
other
reasons
of
no
less
importance
might
be
advanced
for
recommending
to
christian
powers
general
congresses
for
the
adjustment
of
their
various
interests
and
for
compelling
the
refractory
to
submit
to
equitable
terms
of
peace
ix
a
third
method
of
terminating
disputes
without
hostilities
was
by
lot
a
practice
commended
by
dion
chrysostom
in
his
speech
on
the
interposition
of
fortune
in
directing
affairs
and
it
was
commended
long
before
him
by
solomon
in
the
xviii
chapter
of
his
proverbs
x
nearly
related
to
the
last
named
method
is
that
of
single
combat
a
practice
recommended
under
the
idea
that
by
the
risque
of
two
lives
a
quarrel
might
be
decided
which
would
otherwise
have
cost
the
blood
of
thousands
in
livy
we
find
metius
addressing
tullus
in
the
following
terms
let
us
try
some
method
of
determining
to
whom
the
shall
belong
without
wasting
the
blood
of
each
people
strabo
says
it
was
the
practice
of
the
ancient
greeks
and
aeneas
proposed
it
to
turnus
as
the
most
equitable
way
of
settling
their
pretensions
it
is
described
too
as
the
custom
of
the
ancient
franks
xi
although
in
doubtful
cases
both
sides
are
bound
to
devise
every
means
of
avoiding
hostilities
yet
it
is
a
duty
more
incumbent
upon
the
claimant
than
upon
the
immediate
possessor
of
whatever
may
be
the
subject
of
dispute
for
it
is
a
rule
not
only
of
civil
but
of
natural
law
that
where
the
pretensions
are
equal
those
of
the
possessor
are
to
be
preferred
to
the
foregoing
remarks
an
additional
observation
may
be
made
that
if
any
one
knowing
his
pretensions
to
be
just
can
not
produce
sufficient
proofs
to
convict
the
intruder
of
injustice
he
can
not
lawfully
have
recourse
to
arms
because
he
has
no
ostensible
right
by
which
he
can
compel
the
intruder
to
relinquish
the
possession
xii
but
where
the
right
is
ambiguous
and
neither
party
has
possession
the
pretender
who
refuses
to
divide
the
claims
may
reasonably
be
charged
with
injustice
xiii
from
what
has
been
said
it
will
not
be
difficult
to
settle
a
much
agitated
question
whether
with
respect
to
those
who
are
the
principal
movers
of
a
war
there
can
be
justice
on
both
sides
for
there
are
distinctions
proper
to
be
made
in
the
various
acceptations
of
the
word
just
a
thing
is
said
to
be
just
either
as
to
its
causes
or
its
effects
the
causes
too
may
be
confined
either
to
justice
in
a
particular
acceptation
or
they
may
be
extended
so
as
to
include
under
that
name
every
kind
of
rectitude
again
a
particular
acceptation
may
be
divided
into
two
kinds
one
relating
to
the
action
and
the
other
to
the
agent
an
agent
may
be
said
to
act
justly
when
in
what
he
does
he
commits
no
breach
of
strict
law
though
his
conduct
may
not
be
conformable
to
equity
in
a
particular
acceptation
of
the
word
justice
with
regard
to
a
matter
in
dispute
it
can
not
in
war
any
more
than
in
legal
proceedings
apply
to
both
sides
for
there
can
be
no
moral
principle
commanding
us
under
the
same
circumstances
both
to
do
and
to
abstain
from
a
particular
action
it
may
happen
indeed
that
neither
of
two
belligerent
powers
may
act
unjustly
for
no
one
can
be
charged
with
acting
unjustly
unless
he
knows
that
he
is
doing
so
but
there
are
many
who
are
not
aware
of
the
nature
extent
and
consequences
of
their
measures
thus
in
a
both
parties
may
sincerely
believe
that
they
have
justice
on
their
side
for
many
things
both
in
law
and
fact
which
would
establish
a
right
may
escape
the
notice
of
men
in
a
general
acceptation
an
action
may
be
called
just
where
the
agent
is
free
from
every
kind
of
blame
yet
in
many
cases
an
agent
may
deviate
from
the
strict
rules
of
legal
justice
and
be
liable
to
no
blame
when
that
deviation
is
owing
to
unavoidable
ignorance
there
having
been
neither
time
nor
opportunity
sufficient
for
him
to
know
the
substance
or
perhaps
existence
of
the
law
so
it
may
happen
in
that
both
parties
are
free
not
only
from
the
imputation
of
injustice
but
from
all
blame
especially
where
either
of
them
is
litigating
a
matter
not
on
his
own
but
on
another
account
as
for
instance
where
a
guardian
is
acting
for
his
ward
he
would
not
be
authorized
in
abandoning
even
a
doubted
right
aristotle
says
that
in
matters
of
disputed
right
neither
side
can
be
charged
with
injustice
conformably
to
which
opinion
quintilian
observes
that
an
upright
pleader
may
be
engaged
on
either
side
of
the
question
aristotle
further
observes
that
passing
a
just
judgment
is
an
ambiguous
term
signifying
that
a
judge
determines
either
according
to
the
strict
letter
of
the
law
or
according
to
the
dictates
of
his
own
conscience
and
in
another
place
he
has
said
that
giving
a
wrong
judgment
through
ignorance
is
no
act
of
injustice
but
in
matters
of
war
and
peace
where
such
weighty
and
varied
interests
on
all
sides
are
concerned
it
would
be
difficult
to
obtain
a
judgment
purely
impartial
and
abstracted
from
all
personal
motives
unless
there
be
the
most
clear
and
undeniable
evidence
on
the
points
in
question
if
we
denominate
a
thing
to
be
just
from
its
effect
in
conferring
certain
rights
in
this
sense
it
is
plain
that
in
war
there
may
be
justice
on
both
sides
in
the
same
manner
a
sentence
not
strictly
legal
or
a
possession
not
perfectly
just
may
nevertheless
confer
certain
rights

is
an
act
of
greater
piety
and
rectitude
to
yield
a
right
than
to
enforce
it
it
was
before
shewn
in
its
proper
place
how
honourable
it
is
to
be
regardless
of
our
own
lives
where
we
can
preserve
the
lives
and
promote
the
lasting
welfare
of
others
a
duty
that
should
operate
with
greater
force
upon
christians
who
have
before
their
eyes
continually
the
example
of
him
who
died
to
save
us
while
we
were
enemies
and
ungodly
an
example
which
calls
upon
us
in
the
most
affecting
manner
not
to
insist
upon
the
rigorous
prosecution
of
our
justest
rights
where
it
can
not
be
done
but
by
the
calamities
which
war
occasions
if
arguments
and
motives
like
these
wanted
authorities
abundance
of
authorities
might
be
adduced
for
their
support
ii
many
reasons
might
be
brought
to
dissuade
us
from
urging
the
full
infliction
of
a
punishment
there
is
an
obvious
instance
in
the
conduct
of
fathers
who
connive
at
many
faults
in
their
children
but
whoever
is
authorized
to
punish
another
assumes
the
character
of
a
sovereign
ruler
that
is
of
a
father
in
allusion
to
which
augustin
addressing
count
marcellinus
says
o
christian
judge
fulfil
the
office
of
a
pious
father
sometimes
indeed
men
are
so
circumstanced
that
to
relinquish
a
right
becomes
not
only
a
laudable
act
but
a
debt
of
respect
to
that
law
which
commands
us
to
love
our
enemies
a
law
to
be
respected
and
obeyed
not
only
for
its
intrinsic
value
but
as
being
a
precept
of
the
gospel
by
the
same
law
and
for
the
same
reasons
we
are
commanded
to
pray
for
and
to
promote
the
welfare
and
safety
of
christian
princes
and
kings
because
their
welfare
and
safety
are
so
essential
to
the
order
peace
and
happiness
of
society
iii
with
respect
to
the
pardon
of
offences
committed
against
ourselves
little
need
be
said
as
it
is
known
to
be
a
leading
clause
in
the
code
of
a
christian
duty
to
which
he
readily
and
freely
submits
knowing
that
god
for
christ
sake
has
forgiven
him
thus
revealed
law
adds
a
sanction
to
what
was
known
by
heathens
to
be
an
amiable
precept
cicero
has
drawn
a
fine
character
of
caesar
in
which
he
commends
the
excellence
of
his
memory
that
could
recollect
every
thing
but
injuries
we
find
many
noble
examples
of
this
excellent
virtue
in
the
writings
of
moses
and
in
various
other
parts
of
scripture
these
and
these
motives
alone
when
they
can
safely
be
complied
with
are
sufficient
to
keep
the
sword
within
its
scabbard
for
the
debt
of
love
and
forbearance
to
our
enemies
is
an
obligation
which
it
is
honourable
to
discharge
iv
it
is
often
a
duty
which
we
owe
to
our
country
and
ourselves
to
forbear
having
recourse
to
arms
after
the
college
of
heralds
had
pronounced
a
war
to
be
just
we
are
informed
by
plutarch
in
the
life
of
numa
that
the
senate
further
deliberated
whether
it
was
expedient
to
undertake
it
according
to
our
saviour
beautiful
and
instructive
parable
a
king
when
he
is
obliged
to
go
to
war
with
another
king
should
first
sit
down
an
expression
implying
an
act
of
deliberation
and
consider
within
himself
whether
with
ten
thousand
men
he
is
able
to
encounter
one
who
is
coming
against
him
with
twenty
times
that
number
and
if
he
finds
himself
unequal
to
the
contest
before
the
enemy
has
entered
his
territories
he
will
send
an
embassy
to
him
offering
terms
of
peace
in
all
cases
of
deliberation
not
only
the
ultimate
but
the
intermediate
objects
leading
to
the
principal
ends
are
to
be
considered
the
final
object
is
always
some
good
or
at
least
the
evasion
of
some
evil
which
amounts
to
the
same
the
means
are
never
to
be
considered
by
themselves
but
only
as
they
have
a
tendency
to
the
proposed
end
wherefore
in
all
cases
of
deliberation
the
proportion
which
the
means
and
the
end
bear
to
each
other
is
to
be
duly
weighed
by
comparing
them
together
a
mode
of
comparison
in
which
there
are
three
rules
necessary
to
be
observed
the
first
thing
in
a
moral
point
of
view
to
be
considered
is
what
tendency
the
desired
object
has
to
produce
good
or
evil
and
if
the
former
has
the
preponderancy
we
are
then
at
liberty
to
chuse
in
the
second
place
if
it
appears
difficult
to
decide
whether
the
good
or
the
evil
predominates
we
may
chuse
the
object
if
in
the
choice
and
use
of
our
means
we
can
give
a
turn
to
affairs
that
may
throw
the
preponderance
into
the
scale
of
advantage
or
lastly
if
the
good
and
the
evil
bear
no
proportion
to
each
other
nor
the
means
at
the
first
view
appear
adequate
to
the
end
if
in
pursuing
an
object
the
tendency
to
good
compared
with
the
tendency
to
evil
be
greater
than
the
evil
itself
when
compared
with
the
good
or
if
the
good
in
comparison
of
the
evil
be
greater
than
the
tendency
to
evil
in
comparison
of
the
tendency
to
good
we
may
decide
in
favour
of
it
cicero
has
treated
these
abstruse
points
in
a
more
popular
and
pleasing
manner
than
abstract
reasoning
would
allow
applying
all
the
beauties
of
eloquence
to
elucidate
moral
truth
he
says
it
is
the
height
of
folly
and
presumption
unnecessarily
to
expose
ourselves
to
dangers
in
encountering
calamities
we
must
imitate
the
conduct
of
physicians
who
use
gentle
remedies
with
weakly
constitutions
but
in
constitutions
of
a
stronger
cast
especially
in
virulent
disorders
they
must
have
recourse
to
more
powerful
though
more
dangerous
expedients
in
the
same
manner
a
skilful
pilot
would
not
attempt
to
face
the
wind
directly
but
would
tack
about
in
order
to
avoid
its
fury
vi
an
example
of
evils
that
ought
by
all
possible
means
to
be
avoided
is
furnished
by
the
consultations
among
the
states
of
gaul
who
according
to
the
account
of
tacitus
deliberated
whether
they
should
make
choice
of
liberty
or
peace
by
liberty
is
here
meant
civil
liberty
that
is
the
right
of
governing
themselves
and
remaining
independent
states
and
by
peace
is
meant
such
a
peace
as
would
prevent
the
whole
people
from
being
exterminated
a
calamity
like
that
which
befel
the
jews
when
their
city
was
besieged
by
titus
in
such
cases
reason
itself
dictates
the
choice
of
peace
as
the
only
means
of
preserving
life
which
is
the
immediate
gift
of
god
and
the
foundation
of
every
blessing
so
that
the
almighty
as
we
read
in
his
sacred
volume
deems
it
a
kindness
when
instead
of
destroying
a
people
he
permits
them
to
be
reduced
to
slavery
therefore
he
admonishes
the
hebrews
by
the
mouth
of
his
prophet
to
surrender
to
the
babylonians
rather
than
to
die
by
pestilence
and
famine
what
has
been
said
of
submitting
to
disadvantages
and
some
calamities
for
the
preservation
of
life
or
liberty
may
be
applied
to
every
object
of
dear
value
as
aristides
says
it
is
a
moral
duty
in
a
storm
to
save
the
ship
by
casting
overboard
the
goods
but
not
the
crew
vii
in
exacting
punishment
it
is
necessary
to
use
the
precaution
of
avoiding
hostilities
with
a
power
of
equal
strength
for
to
avenge
a
wrong
or
to
assert
a
right
by
force
of
arms
requires
a
superiority
of
strength
so
that
not
only
prudence
but
a
regard
for
their
subjects
will
at
all
times
deter
rulers
from
involving
their
people
in
the
calamities
of
war
a
principle
of
justice
too
the
sole
directress
of
human
affairs
binding
sovereigns
and
subjects
to
each
other
by
their
mutual
interests
will
teach
this
lesson
of
precaution
for
reparation
must
be
looked
for
at
the
hands
of
those
who
bring
on
the
calamities
of
wanton
and
unnecessary
war
livy
calls
that
a
just
which
is
a
necessary
war
and
it
is
a
pious
cause
when
no
hope
is
left
but
in
recourse
to
arms
viii
it
is
but
now
and
then
a
cause
of
such
imperious
necessity
occurs
as
to
demand
the
decision
of
the
sword
and
that
is
when
as
florus
says
the
desertion
of
a
right
will
be
followed
by
calamities
far
more
cruel
than
the
fiercest
wars
seneca
says
that
it
is
right
to
meet
danger
when
equal
harm
would
result
from
acquiescing
in
an
injury
and
in
this
he
is
supported
by
tacitus
who
calls
war
a
happy
exchange
for
a
miserable
and
insecure
peace
and
the
same
animated
writer
in
another
place
observes
that
an
oppressed
people
may
recover
their
liberty
by
daring
enterprize
and
if
defeated
they
can
not
be
reduced
to
greater
subjection
than
before
a
sentiment
with
which
livy
accords
in
naming
peace
when
coupled
with
servitude
a
far
more
grievous
calamity
than
all
the
horrors
of
war
but
it
is
not
so
as
cicero
says
where
defeat
will
be
attended
with
proscription
and
victory
with
bondage
ix
another
necessary
precaution
relates
to
the
time
when
it
is
proper
to
undertake
a
war
which
depends
upon
a
due
calculation
whether
there
are
resources
and
strength
sufficient
to
support
our
just
pretensions
this
is
conformable
to
what
was
said
by
augustus
that
no
war
should
be
undertaken
but
where
the
hopes
of
advantage
could
be
shewn
to
overbalance
the
apprehensions
of
ruin
scipio
africanus
and
lucius
aemilius
paulus
used
to
speak
in
terms
not
inapplicable
to
this
subject
for
they
said
it
was
never
right
to
try
the
event
of
battle
but
under
extreme
necessity
or
favourable
circumstances
the
above
precautions
are
of
great
use
where
we
hope
by
the
dread
and
fame
of
our
preparations
to
accomplish
our
object
with
little
or
no
danger
chapter
xxv
the
causes
of
undertaking
war
for
others
sovereigns
may
engage
in
war
to
support
the
rights
of
their
subjects
whether
an
innocent
subject
can
be
delivered
up
to
an
enemy
to
avoid
danger
wars
justly
undertaken
in
support
of
confederates
upon
equal
or
unequal
terms
for
friends
for
any
men
omission
of
this
duty
not
blamable
from
motives
of
whether
war
may
be
justly
undertaken
in
defence
of
another
subjects
explained
by
distinctions
i
in
speaking
of
belligerent
powers
it
was
shewn
that
the
law
of
nature
authorises
the
assertion
not
only
of
our
own
rights
but
of
those
also
belonging
to
others
the
causes
therefore
which
justify
the
principals
engaged
in
war
will
justify
those
also
who
afford
assistance
to
others
but
whether
any
one
presides
over
an
household
or
a
state
the
first
and
most
necessary
care
is
the
support
of
his
dependents
or
subjects
for
the
household
forms
but
one
body
with
the
master
and
the
people
with
the
sovereign
so
the
people
of
israel
under
the
command
of
joshua
took
up
arms
in
support
of
the
gibeonites
whom
they
had
subdued
our
forefathers
said
cicero
to
the
romans
often
engaged
in
war
to
support
the
rights
of
merchants
whose
vessels
had
been
plundered
the
same
romans
who
would
refuse
to
take
arms
for
a
people
who
were
only
allies
did
not
hesitate
to
assert
by
force
of
arms
the
injured
rights
of
the
same
when
they
became
their
subjects
ii
yet
the
cause
of
any
subject
although
it
may
be
a
just
cause
does
not
always
bind
sovereigns
or
rulers
to
take
arms
but
only
when
it
can
be
done
without
inconvenience
to
all
or
the
greater
part
of
their
subjects
for
the
interests
of
the
whole
community
rather
than
those
of
particular
parts
are
the
principal
objects
of
a
sovereign
care
and
the
greater
any
part
is
the
nearer
its
claims
and
pretensions
approximate
to
those
of
the
whole
iii
some
have
maintained
the
position
that
if
an
enemy
requires
the
surrender
of
a
citizen
however
innocent
the
demand
must
unquestionably
be
complied
with
if
the
state
is
too
feeble
to
resist
it
this
opinion
is
strongly
controverted
by
vasquez
but
if
we
attend
to
his
meaning
more
than
his
words
we
shall
find
it
to
be
the
drift
of
his
argument
that
such
a
citizen
ought
not
to
be
rashly
abandoned
while
there
remains
any
possible
hope
of
protecting
him
for
as
a
case
in
point
he
alleges
the
conduct
of
the
italian
infantry
who
upon
receiving
assurances
of
protection
from
caesar
deserted
pompey
even
before
he
was
reduced
to
absolute
despair
a
conduct
which
he
deservedly
reprobates
in
the
strongest
terms
but
whether
an
innocent
citizen
may
be
given
up
into
the
hands
of
an
enemy
to
avoid
imminent
destruction
which
would
otherwise
fall
upon
the
state
is
a
point
that
has
been
formerly
and
is
still
disputed
by
the
learned
according
to
the
beautiful
fable
which
demosthenes
told
of
the
wolves
who
demanded
of
the
sheep
the
surrender
of
the
dogs
as
the
only
terms
of
peace
the
lawfulness
of
this
is
denied
not
only
by
vasquez
but
by
one
whose
opinions
that
writer
condemns
as
bearing
a
near
approach
to
perfidy
sotus
holds
it
as
an
established
maxim
that
such
a
citizen
is
bound
to
deliver
himself
up
this
vasquez
denies
because
the
nature
of
civil
society
which
every
one
has
entered
into
for
his
own
advantage
requires
no
such
thing
no
conclusion
can
be
drawn
from
hence
except
that
a
citizen
is
not
bound
to
this
by
any
right
strictly
so
called
while
at
the
same
time
the
law
of
charity
will
not
suffer
him
to
act
otherwise
for
there
are
many
duties
not
properly
included
in
the
idea
of
strict
justice
these
are
regarded
as
acts
of
good
will
the
performance
of
which
is
not
only
crowned
with
praise
but
the
omission
of
them
can
not
escape
censure
such
is
the
complexion
of
the
following
maxim
that
every
one
should
prefer
the
lives
of
an
innumerable
and
innocent
multitude
to
his
own
personal
and
private
welfare
cicero
in
defending
publius
sextius
says
if
i
were
taking
a
voyage
with
my
friends
and
happening
to
meet
with
a
fleet
of
pirates
they
threatened
to
sink
our
little
bark
unless
the
crew
surrendered
me
as
the
victim
to
appease
their
fury
i
would
sooner
throw
myself
into
the
deep
than
suffer
my
companions
out
of
their
affection
to
me
to
encounter
sure
death
or
even
imminent
danger
but
after
establishing
this
point
there
remains
a
doubt
whether
any
one
can
be
compelled
to
do
what
he
is
bound
to
do
sotus
denies
this
and
in
support
of
his
argument
quotes
the
case
of
a
rich
man
who
though
bound
from
motives
of
charity
to
supply
the
wants
of
the
needy
can
not
be
compelled
to
do
so
but
the
transactions
of
equals
with
each
other
must
be
regulated
upon
principles
very
different
from
those
that
regulate
the
mutual
relations
of
sovereigns
and
subjects
for
an
equal
can
not
compel
an
equal
to
the
performance
of
any
thing
but
what
he
is
strictly
bound
by
law
to
perform
but
a
superior
may
compel
an
inferior
to
the
performance
of
other
duties
besides
those
of
perfect
obligations
for
that
is
a
right
peculiarly
and
essentially
belonging
to
the
nature
of
superiority
therefore
certain
legislative
provisions
may
be
made
enacting
the
performance
of
such
duties
as
seem
to
partake
of
the
nature
of
benevolence
phocion
as
it
is
mentioned
in
plutarch
lives
said
that
the
persons
whom
alexander
demanded
had
reduced
the
commonwealth
to
such
distress
that
if
he
demanded
even
his
dearest
friend
nicocles
he
should
vote
for
delivering
him
up
iv
next
to
subjects
and
even
upon
an
equal
footing
with
them
as
to
claims
of
protection
are
allies
a
name
including
in
its
consequences
and
effects
both
those
who
have
formed
a
subordinate
connection
with
another
power
and
those
who
have
entered
into
engagements
of
mutual
assistance
yet
no
such
compacts
can
bind
either
of
the
parties
to
the
support
or
prosecution
of
unjust
wars
and
this
is
the
reason
why
the
lacedaemonians
before
they
went
to
war
with
the
athenians
left
all
their
allies
at
liberty
to
decide
for
themselves
upon
the
justice
of
the
quarrel
to
which
an
additional
observation
may
be
made
that
no
ally
is
bound
to
assist
in
the
prosecution
of
schemes
which
afford
no
possible
prospect
of
a
happy
termination
for
this
would
be
defeating
the
very
end
of
alliances
which
are
contracted
from
motives
of
public
advantage
and
not
for
a
participation
in
ruin
but
any
power
is
obliged
to
defend
an
ally
even
against
those
with
whom
it
is
already
connected
by
subsisting
treaties
provided
those
treaties
contain
no
express
condition
prohibiting
such
defence
thus
the
athenians
might
have
defended
the
corcyraeans
in
a
just
cause
even
against
the
corinthians
their
more
ancient
allies
a
third
case
is
that
where
assistance
has
not
been
expressly
promised
to
a
friendly
power
and
yet
is
due
on
the
score
of
friendship
if
it
can
be
given
without
inconvenience
upon
this
principle
abraham
took
arms
in
defence
of
his
kinsman
lot
and
the
romans
charged
the
antiates
to
commit
no
acts
of
piracy
upon
the
greeks
as
being
a
people
of
the
same
kindred
with
the
italians
it
was
no
unusual
thing
with
the
romans
to
begin
or
at
least
to
threaten
to
begin
wars
not
only
in
support
of
allies
to
whom
they
were
bound
by
treaty
but
in
support
of
any
friendly
powers
vi
the
last
and
most
extensive
motive
is
the
common
tie
of
one
common
nature
which
alone
is
sufficient
to
oblige
men
to
assist
each
other
vii
it
is
a
question
whether
one
man
is
bound
to
protect
another
or
one
people
another
people
from
injury
and
aggression
plato
thinks
that
the
individual
or
state
not
defending
another
from
intended
violence
is
deserving
of
punishment
a
case
for
which
provision
was
made
by
the
laws
of
the
egyptians
but
in
the
first
place
it
is
certain
that
no
one
is
bound
to
give
assistance
or
protection
when
it
will
be
attended
with
evident
danger
for
a
man
own
life
and
property
and
a
state
own
existence
and
preservation
are
either
to
the
individual
or
the
state
objects
of
greater
value
and
prior
consideration
than
the
welfare
and
security
of
other
individuals
or
states
nor
will
states
or
individuals
be
bound
to
risk
their
own
safety
even
when
the
aggrieved
or
oppressed
party
can
not
be
relieved
but
by
the
destruction
of
the
invader
or
oppressor
for
under
some
circumstances
it
is
impossible
successfully
to
oppose
cruelty
and
oppression
the
punishment
of
which
must
be
left
to
the
eternal
judge
of
mankind
viii
though
it
is
a
rule
established
by
the
laws
of
nature
and
of
social
order
and
a
rule
confirmed
by
all
the
records
of
history
that
every
sovereign
is
supreme
judge
in
his
own
kingdom
and
over
his
own
subjects
in
whose
disputes
no
foreign
power
can
justly
interfere
yet
where
a
busiris
a
phalaris
or
a
thracian
diomede
provoke
their
people
to
despair
and
resistance
by
unheard
of
cruelties
having
themselves
abandoned
all
the
laws
of
nature
they
lose
the
rights
of
independent
sovereigns
and
can
no
longer
claim
the
privilege
of
the
law
of
nations
thus
constantine
took
up
arms
against
maxentius
and
licinius
and
other
roman
emperors
either
took
or
threatened
to
take
them
against
the
persians
if
they
did
not
desist
from
persecuting
the
christians
admitting
that
it
would
be
fraught
with
the
greatest
dangers
if
subjects
were
allowed
to
redress
grievances
by
force
of
arms
it
does
not
necessarily
follow
that
other
powers
are
prohibited
from
giving
them
assistance
when
labouring
under
grievous
oppressions
for
whenever
the
impediment
to
any
action
is
of
a
personal
nature
and
not
inherent
in
the
action
itself
one
person
may
perform
for
another
what
he
can
not
do
for
himself
provided
it
is
an
action
by
which
some
kind
service
may
be
rendered
thus
a
guardian
or
any
other
friend
may
undertake
an
action
for
a
ward
which
he
is
incapacitated
from
doing
for
himself
the
impediment
which
prohibits
a
subject
from
making
resistance
does
not
depend
upon
the
nature
of
the
occasion
which
would
operate
equally
upon
the
feelings
of
men
whether
they
were
subjects
or
not
but
upon
the
character
of
the
persons
who
can
not
transfer
their
natural
allegiance
from
their
own
sovereign
to
another
but
this
principle
does
not
bind
those
who
are
not
the
of
that
sovereign
or
power
their
opposition
to
him
or
the
state
may
sometimes
be
connected
with
the
defence
of
the
oppressed
and
can
never
be
construed
into
an
act
of
treason
but
pretexts
of
that
kind
can
not
always
be
allowed
they
may
often
be
used
as
the
cover
of
ambitious
designs
but
right
does
not
necessarily
lose
its
nature
from
being
in
the
hands
of
wicked
men
the
sea
still
continues
a
channel
of
lawful
intercourse
though
sometimes
navigated
by
pirates
and
swords
are
still
instruments
of
defence
though
sometimes
wielded
by
robbers
or
assassins

i
having
in
the
preceding
books
considered
by
what
persons
and
for
what
causes
war
may
be
justly
declared
and
undertaken
the
subject
necessarily
leads
to
an
inquiry
into
the
circumstances
under
which
war
may
be
undertaken
into
the
extent
to
which
it
may
be
carried
and
into
the
manner
in
which
its
rights
may
be
enforced
now
all
these
matters
may
be
viewed
in
the
light
of
privileges
resulting
simply
from
the
law
of
nature
and
of
nations
or
as
the
effects
of
some
prior
treaty
or
promise
but
the
actions
which
are
authorised
by
the
law
of
nature
are
those
that
are
first
entitled
to
attention
ii
in
the
first
place
as
it
has
occasionally
been
observed
the
means
employed
in
the
pursuit
of
any
object
must
in
a
great
degree
derive
the
complexion
of
their
moral
character
from
the
nature
of
the
end
to
which
they
lead
it
is
evident
therefore
that
we
may
justly
avail
ourselves
of
those
means
provided
they
be
lawful
which
are
necessary
to
the
attainment
of
any
right
right
in
this
place
means
what
is
strictly
so
called
signifying
the
moral
power
of
action
which
any
one
as
a
member
of
society
possesses
on
which
account
a
person
if
he
has
no
other
means
of
saving
his
life
is
justified
in
using
any
forcible
means
of
repelling
an
attack
though
he
who
makes
it
as
for
instance
a
soldier
in
battle
in
doing
so
is
guilty
of
no
crime
for
this
is
a
right
resulting
not
properly
from
the
crime
of
another
but
from
the
privilege
of
which
nature
grants
to
every
one
besides
if
any
one
has
sure
and
undoubted
grounds
to
apprehend
imminent
danger
from
any
thing
belonging
to
another
he
may
seize
it
without
any
regard
to
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
that
owner
yet
he
does
not
by
that
seizure
become
the
proprietor
of
it
for
that
is
not
necessary
to
the
end
he
has
in
view
he
may
detain
it
as
a
precautionary
measure
till
he
can
obtain
satisfactory
assurance
of
security
upon
the
same
principle
any
one
has
a
natural
right
to
seize
what
belongs
to
him
and
is
unlawfully
detained
by
another
or
if
that
is
impracticable
he
may
seize
something
of
equal
value
which
is
nearly
the
same
as
recovering
a
debt
recoveries
of
this
kind
establish
a
property
in
the
things
so
reclaimed
which
is
the
only
method
of
restoring
the
equality
and
repairing
the
breaches
of
violated
justice
so
too
when
punishment
is
lawful
and
just
all
the
means
absolutely
necessary
to
enforce
its
execution
are
also
lawful
and
just
and
every
act
that
forms
a
part
of
the
punishment
such
as
destroying
an
property
and
country
by
fire
or
any
other
way
falls
within
the
limits
of
justice
proportionable
to
the
offence
iii
in
the
second
place
it
is
generally
known
that
it
is
not
the
origin
only
of
a
just
war
which
is
to
be
viewed
as
the
principal
source
of
many
of
our
rights
but
there
may
be
causes
growing
out
of
that
war
which
may
give
birth
to
additional
rights
as
in
proceedings
at
law
the
sentence
of
the
court
may
give
to
the
successful
litigant
other
rights
besides
those
belonging
to
the
original
matter
of
dispute
so
those
who
join
our
enemies
either
as
allies
or
subjects
give
us
a
right
of
defending
ourselves
against
them
also
so
too
a
nation
engaging
in
an
unjust
war
the
injustice
of
which
she
knows
and
ought
to
know
becomes
liable
to
make
good
all
the
expences
and
losses
incurred
because
she
has
been
guilty
of
occasioning
them
in
the
same
manner
those
powers
who
become
auxiliaries
in
wars
undertaken
without
any
reasonable
grounds
contract
a
degree
of
guilt
and
render
themselves
liable
to
punishment
in
proportion
to
the
injustice
of
their
measures
plato
approves
of
war
conducted
so
far
as
to
compel
the
aggressor
to
indemnify
the
injured
and
the
innocent
iv
in
the
third
place
an
individual
or
belligerent
power
may
in
the
prosecution
of
a
lawful
object
do
many
things
which
were
not
in
the
contemplation
of
the
original
design
and
which
in
themselves
it
would
not
be
lawful
to
do
thus
in
order
to
obtain
what
belongs
to
us
when
it
is
impossible
to
recover
the
specific
thing
we
may
take
more
than
our
due
under
condition
of
repaying
whatever
is
above
the
real
value
for
the
same
reason
it
is
lawful
to
attack
a
ship
manned
by
pirates
or
a
house
occupied
by
robbers
although
in
that
ship
or
that
house
there
may
be
many
innocent
persons
whose
lives
are
endangered
by
such
attack
but
we
have
had
frequent
occasion
to
remark
that
what
is
conformable
to
right
taken
in
its
strictest
sense
is
not
always
lawful
in
a
moral
point
of
view
for
there
are
many
instances
in
which
the
law
of
charity
will
not
allow
us
to
insist
upon
our
right
with
the
utmost
rigour
a
reason
for
which
it
will
be
necessary
to
guard
against
things
which
fall
not
within
the
original
purpose
of
an
action
and
the
happening
of
which
might
be
foreseen
unless
indeed
the
action
has
a
tendency
to
produce
advantages
that
will
far
outweigh
the
consequences
of
any
accidental
calamity
and
the
apprehensions
of
evil
are
by
no
means
to
be
put
in
competition
with
the
sure
hopes
of
a
successful
issue
but
to
determine
in
such
cases
requires
no
ordinary
penetration
and
discretion
but
wherever
there
is
any
doubt
it
is
always
the
safer
way
to
decide
in
favour
of
another
interest
than
to
follow
the
bent
of
our
own
inclination
suffer
the
tares
to
grow
our
divine
least
in
rooting
up
the
tares
you
root
up
the
wheat
also
the
general
destruction
which
the
almighty
in
right
of
his
supreme
majesty
has
sometimes
decreed
and
executed
is
not
a
rule
which
we
can
presume
to
follow
he
has
not
invested
men
in
the
exercise
of
power
with
those
transcendent
sovereign
rights
yet
he
himself
notwithstanding
the
unchangeable
nature
of
his
sovereign
will
was
inclined
to
spare
the
most
wicked
cities
if
ten
righteous
persons
could
be
found
therein
examples
like
these
may
furnish
us
with
rules
to
decide
how
far
the
rights
of
war
against
an
enemy
may
be
exercised
or
relaxed
it
frequently
occurs
as
a
matter
of
inquiry
how
far
we
are
authorised
to
act
against
those
who
are
neither
enemies
nor
wish
to
be
thought
so
but
who
supply
our
enemies
with
certain
articles
for
we
know
that
it
is
a
point
which
on
former
and
recent
occasions
has
been
contested
with
the
greatest
animosity
some
wishing
to
enforce
with
all
imaginary
rigour
the
rights
of
war
and
others
standing
up
for
the
freedom
of
commerce
in
the
first
place
a
distinction
must
be
made
between
the
commodities
themselves
for
there
are
some
such
as
arms
for
instance
which
are
only
of
use
in
war
there
are
others
again
which
are
of
no
use
in
war
but
only
administer
to
luxury
but
there
are
some
articles
such
as
money
provisions
ships
and
naval
stores
which
are
of
use
at
all
times
both
in
peace
and
war
as
to
conveying
articles
of
the
first
kind
it
is
evident
that
any
one
must
be
ranked
as
an
enemy
who
supplies
an
enemy
with
the
means
of
prosecuting
hostilities
against
the
conveyance
of
commodities
of
the
second
kind
no
just
complaint
can
be
and
as
to
articles
of
the
third
class
from
their
being
of
a
doubtful
kind
a
distinction
must
be
made
between
the
times
of
war
and
peace
for
if
a
power
can
not
defend
itself
but
by
intercepting
the
supplies
sent
to
an
enemy
necessity
will
justify
such
a
step
but
upon
condition
of
making
restoration
unless
there
be
some
additional
reasons
to
the
contrary
but
if
the
conveyance
of
goods
to
an
enemy
tends
to
obstruct
any
belligerent
power
in
the
prosecution
of
a
lawful
right
and
the
person
so
conveying
them
possesses
the
means
of
knowing
it
if
that
power
for
instance
is
besieging
a
town
or
blockading
a
port
in
expectation
of
a
speedy
surrender
and
a
peace
the
person
who
furnishes
the
enemy
with
supplies
and
the
means
of
prolonged
resistance
will
be
guilty
of
an
aggression
and
injury
towards
that
power
he
will
incur
the
same
guilt
as
a
person
would
do
by
assisting
a
debtor
to
escape
from
prison
and
thereby
to
defraud
his
creditor
his
goods
may
be
taken
by
way
of
indemnity
and
in
discharge
of
the
debt
if
the
person
has
not
yet
committed
the
injury
but
only
intended
to
do
so
the
aggrieved
power
will
have
a
right
to
detain
his
goods
in
order
to
compel
him
to
give
future
security
either
by
putting
into
his
hands
hostages
or
pledges
or
indeed
in
any
other
way
but
if
there
are
evident
proofs
of
injustice
in
an
enemy
conduct
the
person
who
supports
him
in
such
a
case
by
furnishing
him
with
succours
will
be
guilty
not
barely
of
a
civil
injury
but
his
giving
assistance
will
amount
to
a
crime
as
enormous
as
it
would
be
to
rescue
a
criminal
in
the
very
face
of
the
judge
and
on
that
account
the
injured
power
may
proceed
against
him
as
a
criminal
and
punish
him
by
a
confiscation
of
his
goods
these
are
the
reasons
which
induce
belligerent
powers
to
issue
manifestoes
as
an
appeal
to
other
states
upon
the
justice
of
their
cause
and
their
probable
hopes
of
ultimate
success
this
question
has
been
introduced
under
the
article
which
refers
to
the
law
of
nature
as
history
supplies
us
with
no
precedent
to
deduce
its
establishment
from
the
voluntary
law
of
nations
we
are
informed
by
polybius
in
his
first
book
that
the
carthaginians
seized
some
of
the
romans
who
were
carrying
supplies
to
their
enemies
though
they
afterwards
gave
them
up
upon
the
demand
of
the
romans
plutarch
says
that
when
demetrius
had
invested
attica
and
taken
the
neighbouring
towns
of
eleusis
and
rhamnus
he
ordered
the
master
and
pilot
of

wars
for

of

can
not
be

must
employ
force
and
terror
as
their
most
proper
agents
but
a
doubt
is
sometimes
entertained
whether
stratagem
may
be
lawfully
used
in
war
the
general
sense
of
mankind
seems
to
have
approved
of
such
a
mode
of
warfare
for
homer
commends
his
hero
ulysses
no
less
for
his
ability
in
military
stratagem
than
for
his
wisdom
xenophon
who
was
a
philosopher
as
well
as
a
soldier
and
historian
has
said
that
nothing
can
be
more
useful
in
war
than
a
stratagem
with
whom
brasidas
in
thucydides
agrees
declaring
it
to
be
the
method
from
which
many
great
generals
have
derived
the
most
brilliant
reputation
and
in
plutarch
agesilaus
maintains
that
deceiving
an
enemy
is
both
just
and
lawful
the
authority
of
polybius
may
be
added
to
those
already
named
for
he
thinks
that
it
shews
greater
talent
in
a
general
to
avail
himself
of
some
favourable
opportunity
to
employ
a
stratagem
than
to
gain
an
open
battle
this
opinion
of
poets
historians
and
philosophers
is
supported
by
that
of
theologians
for
augustin
has
said
that
in
the
prosecution
of
a
just
war
the
justice
of
the
cause
is
no
way
affected
by
the
attainment
of
the
end
whether
the
object
be
accomplished
by
stratagem
or
open
force
and
chrysostom
in
his
beautiful
little
treatise
on
the
priestly
office
observes
that
the
highest
praises
are
bestowed
on
those
generals
who
have
practised
successful
stratagems
yet
there
is
one
circumstance
upon
which
the
decision
of
this
question
turns
more
than
upon
any
opinion
even
of
the
highest
authority
and
that
is
whether
stratagem
ought
to
be
ranked
as
one
of
those
evils
which
are
prohibited
under
the
maxim
of
not
doing
evil
that
good
may
ensue
or
to
be
reckoned
as
one
of
those
actions
which
though
evil
in
themselves
may
be
so
modified
by
particular
occasions
as
to
lose
their
criminality
in
consideration
of
the
good
to
which
they
lead
vii
there
is
one
kind
of
stratagem
it
is
proper
to
remark
of
a
negative
and
another
of
a
positive
kind
the
word
stratagem
upon
the
authority
of
labeo
taken
in
a
negative
sense
includes
such
actions
as
have
nothing
criminal
in
them
though
calculated
to
deceive
where
any
one
for
instance
uses
a
degree
of
dissimulation
or
concealment
in
order
to
defend
his
own
property
or
that
of
others
so
that
undoubtedly
there
is
something
of
harshness
in
the
opinion
of
cicero
who
says
there
is
no
scene
of
life
that
will
allow
either
simulation
or
dissimulation
to
be
practised
for
as
you
are
not
bound
to
disclose
to
others
all
that
you
either
know
or
intend
it
follows
that
on
certain
occasions
some
acts
of
dissimulation
that
is
of
concealment
may
be
lawful
this
is
a
talent
which
cicero
in
many
parts
of
his
writings
acknowledges
that
it
is
absolutely
necessary
for
statesmen
to
possess
the
history
of
jeremiah
in
the
xxxviiith
chapter
of
his
prophecy
furnishes
a
remarkable
instance
of
this
kind
for
when
that
prophet
was
interrogated
by
the
king
respecting
the
event
of
the
siege
he
prudently
in
compliance
with
the
king
orders
concealed
the
real
matter
from
the
nobles
assigning
a
different
though
not
a
false
reason
for
the
conference
which
he
had
had
in
the
same
manner
abraham
called
sarah
his
sister
an
appellation
used
familiarly
at
that
time
to
denote
a
near
relation
by
blood
concealing
the
circumstance
of
her
being
his
wife
viii
a
stratagem
of
a
positive
kind
when
practised
in
actions
is
called
a
feint
and
when
used
in
conversation
it
receives
the
name
of
a
lie
or
falsehood
a
distinction
is
made
by
some
between
these
two
kinds
of
stratagems
who
say
that
words
are
signs
of
our
ideas
but
actions
are
not
so
but
there
is
more
of
truth
in
the
opposite
opinion
that
words
of
themselves
unaccompanied
by
the
intention
of
the
speaker
signify
nothing
more
than
the
inarticulate
cries
would
do
of
any
one
labouring
under
grief
or
any
other
passion
which
sounds
come
under
the
denomination
of
actions
rather
than
of
speech
but
should
it
be
said
that
being
able
to
convey
to
others
the
conceptions
of
his
mind
by
words
adapted
to
the
purpose
is
a
peculiar
gift
of
nature
by
which
man
is
distinguished
from
other
parts
of
the
animated
creation
the
truth
of
this
can
not
be
denied
to
which
we
may
add
that
such
communication
may
be
made
not
only
by
words
but
by
signs
or
gestures
like
those
used
to
the
dumb
it
makes
no
difference
whether
those
signs
or
gestures
have
any
natural
connection
with
the
thing
they
are
intended
to
signify
or
whether
such
a
connection
is
only
assigned
to
them
by
custom
equivalent
to
such
signs
or
gestures
is
handwriting
which
may
be
considered
as
a
dumb
language
deriving
its
force
not
merely
from
the
words
used
and
the
particular
form
of
the
letters
but
from
the
real
intention
of
the
writer
to
be
gathered
from
thence
to
be
gathered
either
from
the
resemblance
between
the
characters
and
the
intentions
as
in
the
egyptian
hieroglyphics
or
from
pure
fancy
as
among
the
chinese
here
likewise
another
distinction
is
necessary
to
be
applied
in
the
same
manner
as
was
done
before
in
order
to
remove
all
ambiguity
in
using
the
term
of
the
law
of
nations
for
it
was
there
said
that
the
laws
established
by
independent
and
separate
states
whether
or
no
those
laws
implied
any
mutual
obligations
were
denominated
the
law
of
nations
so
that
words
gestures
and
signs
made
use
of
to
convey
a
meaning
imply
an
obligation
in
all
the
persons
concerned
to
receive
and
employ
them
in
their
common
acceptation
but
the
employment
of
other
means
coming
under
none
of
those
descriptions
can
not
be
construed
into
a
violation
of
any
social
contract
although
some
may
be
deceived
thereby
it
is
the
real
nature
of
the
actions
that
is
here
spoken
of
and
not
the
accidental
circumstances
attending
them
such
actions
for
instance
as
occasion
no
mischief
or
if
they
do
so
there
is
no
guilt
where
there
is
no
treacherous
design
we
have
an
instance
of
the
former
kind
in
the
conduct
of
our
saviour
who
on
the
way
to
emmaus
pretended
to
the
disciples
that
he
was
going
further
here
was
a
harmless
stratagem
unless
we
interpret
the
words
as
expressive
of
his
intention
to
have
gone
further
if
he
had
not
been
prevented
by
their
efforts
and
entreaties
to
detain
him
and
in
another
part
of
the
sacred
history
it
is
said
that
he
intended
to
have
passed
by
the
apostles
on
the
sea
that
is
he
intended
to
have
done
it
had
he
not
been
so
earnestly
importuned
by
them
to
go
into
the
ship
there
is
another
instance
too
in
the
conduct
of
paul
who
circumcised
timothy
though
he
knew
the
jews
would
conclude
from
thence
that
the
ordinance
of
circumcision
which
in
reality
had
been
abolished
was
still
binding
upon
the
descendants
of
israel
and
that
paul
and
timothy
were
of
the
same
opinion
whereas
paul
had
no
such
intention
but
only
hoped
by
that
means
to
open
for
himself
and
timothy
a
way
to
more
familiar
intercourse
with
the
jews
neither
could
an
ordinance
of
that
kind
when
the
divine
obligation
was
repealed
any
longer
be
deemed
of
such
importance
nor
could
the
evil
of
a
temporary
error
resulting
from
thence
and
afterwards
to
be
corrected
be
regarded
as
equivalent
to
the
opportunity
which
paul
thought
to
gain
of
making
it
conducive
to
the
introduction
of
christian
truth
the
greek
fathers
have
given
the
name
of
economy
or
management
to
stratagems
of
this
kind
on
this
subject
there
is
an
admirable
sentiment
in
clement
of
alexandria
who
in
speaking
of
a
good
man
says
that
he
will
do
many
things
for
the
benefit
of
his
neighbour
alone
which
he
would
not
otherwise
have
undertaken
one
of
these
stratagems
was
practised
by
the
romans
who
during
the
time
that
they
were
besieged
in
the
capitol
threw
some
loaves
of
bread
into
the
enemy
camp
that
it
might
not
be
supposed
they
were
pressed
by
famine
the
feigned
flight
which
joshua
ordered
his
people
to
make
to
assist
him
in
his
designs
upon
ai
affords
an
instance
of
a
stratagem
of
the
second
kind
the
ensuing
mischiefs
of
which
may
be
considered
as
some
of
the
effects
of
lawful
war
the
original
design
of
that
pretended
flight
does
not
at
all
affect
the
question
the
enemy
took
it
for
a
proof
of
fear
and
he
was
at
liberty
to
do
so
without
debarring
the
other
of
his
right
to
march
this
way
or
that
with
an
accelerated
or
retarded
motion
with
a
shew
of
courage
or
an
appearance
of
fear
as
he
might
judge
it
most
expedient
history
furnishes
us
with
innumerable
examples
of
deceptions
practised
with
success
upon
an
enemy
by
assuming
his
arms
ensigns
colours
or
uniforms
all
which
may
be
justified
upon
the
same
principle
for
all
these
are
actions
which
any
one
may
avail
himself
of
at
his
pleasure
by
departing
from
the
usual
course
of
his
military
system
for
such
points
of
discipline
and
system
depend
upon
the
will
and
fancy
of
the
military
commanders
in
each
state
rather
than
upon
any
invariable
custom
equally
binding
upon
all
nations
ix
those
signs
by
which
the
daily
intercourse
of
life
is
maintained
form
a
subject
of
more
weighty
discussion
with
which
the
consideration
of
lies
or
falsehood
is
necessarily
interwoven
all
stratagems
of
this
kind
are
so
direct
a
violation
of
all
moral
principle
both
in
their
nature
and
consequences
that
almost
every
page
of
the
revealed
will
of
god
declares
their
condemnation
solomon
describes
a
righteous
that
is
a
good
man
as
one
who
holds
every
false
word
in
detestation
deprecating
the
least
appearance
of
deception
and
the
apostle
injunction
accords
with
these
sentiments
instructing
his
disciples
not
to
lie
to
one
another
nor
is
it
in
the
high
standard
of
perfection
alone
which
the
divine
records
present
that
such
a
recommendation
of
fair
open
and
sincere
dealing
is
to
be
found
it
is
the
theme
of
praise
with
poets
and
philosophers
and
the
angry
hero
of
the
grecian
poet
declares
that
he
detests
the
man
as
an
infernal
being
who
utters
one
thing
with
his
tongue
while
he
conceals
another
in
his
heart
but
making
some
allowance
for
poetic
fiction
we
find
even
the
grave
sober
and
discerning
stagirite
describing
falsehood
as
a
vile
and
abominable
refuge
and
painting
truth
as
a
lovely
object
that
must
extort
the
warmest
praise
these
are
all
great
and
high
authorities
in
favour
of
open
dealing
yet
there
are
names
of
no
less
weight
both
among
sacred
and
profane
writers
whose
opinions
are
a
vindication
of
stratagems
when
used
upon
proper
occasions
one
writer
speaks
of
a
case
where
stratagem
may
be
used
even
for
the
benefit
of
the
person
on
whom
it
is
practised
and
adduces
the
instances
of
a
physician
who
by
means
of
a
deception
overcame
the
perverseness
of
a
patient
and
wrought
a
salutary
cure
x
to
reconcile
such
a
variety
of
discordant
opinions
it
may
be
necessary
to
devise
some
way
of
examining
falsehood
both
in
its
more
extensive
and
more
confined
acceptation
nor
is
speaking
an
untruth
unawares
to
be
considered
in
the
nature
of
a
lie
but
the
falsehood
which
comes
within
the
limits
here
defined
is
the
known
and
deliberate
utterance
of
any
thing
contrary
to
our
real
conviction
intention
and
understanding
words
or
signs
importing
the
same
meaning
as
words
are
generally
taken
for
conceptions
of
the
mind
yet
it
is
no
lie
for
any
man
to
utter
a
falsehood
which
he
believes
to
be
true
but
the
propagation
of
a
truth
which
any
one
believes
to
be
false
in
him
amounts
to
a
lie
there
must
be
in
the
use
of
the
words
therefore
an
intention
to
deceive
in
order
to
constitute
a
falsehood
in
the
proper
and
common
acceptation
consequently
when
any
one
single
word
or
the
whole
tenour
of
a
discourse
admits
of
more
significations
than
one
either
by
the
use
of
some
popular
phrase
some
term
of
art
or
intelligible
figure
of
speech
in
that
case
if
the
speaker
intention
correspond
with
any
one
of
those
meanings
he
can
not
be
charged
with
using
falsehood
although
it
is
possible
that
a
hearer
may
take
his
words
in
a
very
different
sense
it
is
true
that
using
such
an
ambiguous
method
of
speaking
on
all
occasions
is
not
to
be
approved
of
though
there
are
particular
circumstances
under
which
it
may
be
reconciled
with
honour
and
justice
in
communicating
knowledge
for
instance
there
is
no
harm
in
using
a
metaphor
an
irony
or
an
hyperbole
figures
of
speech
tending
either
to
adorn
or
to
elucidate
a
subject
there
are
cases
too
where
by
this
doubtful
mode
of
expression
it
may
be
proper
to
avoid
an
urgent
and
impertinent
question
there
is
an
instance
of
the
former
kind
in
our
saviour
saying
that
our
friend
lazarus
sleepeth
where
the
disciples
understood
him
as
if
he
were
speaking
of
the
refreshing
rest
of
an
ordinary
sleep
and
when
he
spoke
of
restoring
the
temple
which
he
meant
his
own
body
he
knew
that
the
jews
applied
what
he
said
to
the
material
edifice
of
the
temple
in
the
same
manner
he
frequently
addressed
the
multitudes
in
parables
which
they
could
not
understand
by
barely
hearing
without
that
docility
of
mind
and
attention
which
the
subject
required
profane
history
too
furnishes
us
with
an
example
of
the
second
kind
in
the
conduct
of
vitellius
who
as
tacitus
informs
us
gave
narcissus
doubtful
and
ambiguous
answers
in
order
to
avoid
his
urgent
questions
as
any
explicit
declaration
might
have
been
attended
with
danger
on
the
other
hand
it
may
happen
to
be
not
only
censurable
but
even
wicked
to
use
such
a
manner
of
speaking
where
either
the
honour
of
god
or
the
welfare
of
mankind
is
concerned
or
indeed
any
matter
which
demands
explicit
avowals
and
open
dealing
thus
in
contracts
every
thing
necessary
to
their
fulfillment
ought
to
be
fully
disclosed
to
those
concerned
there
is
an
apposite
expression
of
cicero
who
says
that
every
degree
of
deception
ought
to
be
banished
from
all
contracts
and
there
is
in
the
old
athenian
laws
a
proverb
conformable
to
this
which
says
there
must
be
nothing
but
open
dealing
in
markets
xi
in
strictness
of
speech
such
ambiguity
is
excluded
from
the
notion
of
a
lie
the
common
notion
of
a
lie
therefore
is
something
spoken
written
marked
or
intimated
which
can
not
be
understood
but
in
a
sense
different
from
the
real
meaning
of
the
speaker
but
a
lie
in
this
stricter
acceptation
having
some
thing
unlawful
in
its
very
nature
necessarily
requires
that
a
distinction
should
be
made
between
it
and
that
latitude
of
expression
already
explained
and
if
this
acceptation
be
properly
considered
at
least
according
to
the
opinion
prevailing
in
all
nations
it
seems
that
no
other
explanation
of
it
is
necessary
to
be
given
except
that
it
is
a
violation
of
the
existing
and
permanent
rights
of
the
person
to
whom
a
discourse
or
particular
signs
are
directed
it
is
a
violation
of
the
rights
of
another
for
it
is
evident
that
no
one
can
utter
a
falsehood
with
a
view
to
impose
upon
himself
the
rights
here
spoken
of
are
peculiarly
connected
with
this
subject
they
imply
that
liberty
of
judgment
which
men
are
understood
by
a
kind
of
tacit
agreement
to
owe
to
each
other
in
their
mutual
intercourse
for
this
and
this
alone
is
that
mutual
obligation
which
men
intended
to
introduce
as
soon
as
they
began
to
use
speech
or
other
signs
of
equal
import
for
without
such
an
obligation
the
invention
of
those
signs
would
have
been
perfectly
nugatory
it
is
requisite
too
that
at
the
time
a
discourse
is
made
such
a
right
or
obligation
should
remain
in
full
force
a
right
may
indeed
have
existed
and
afterwards
have
become
obsolete
owing
to
the
rise
or
occurrence
of
some
new
right
which
is
the
case
with
a
debt
that
may
be
released
by
acquittance
or
of
a
condition
it
is
farther
requisite
to
constitute
a
violation
of
this
right
that
the
ensuing
injury
should
immediately
affect
the
person
addressed
as
in
contracts
there
can
be
no
injustice
but
what
affects
one
of
the
parties
or
persons
concerned
and
perhaps
under
the
head
of
this
right
it
may
not
be
improper
to
assign
a
place
to
that
true
speaking
which
plato
following
simonides
classes
with
justice
in
order
to
form
a
more
striking
contrast
with
that
falsehood
so
often
prohibited
in
scripture
by
the
name
of
false
witness
to
or
against
our
neighbour
and
which
augustin
in
defining
a
lie
calls
an
intention
to
deceive
cicero
also
in
his
offices
lays
down
truth
as
the
basis
of
justice
the
right
to
a
discovery
of
the
whole
truth
may
be
relinquished
by
the
express
consent
of
the
persons
who
are
engaged
in
a
treaty
the
one
may
declare
his
intention
not
to
disclose
certain
points
and
the
other
may
allow
of
this
reserve
there
may
be
also
a
tacit
presumption
that
there
are
just
reasons
for
such
reserve
which
may
perhaps
be
necessary
out
of
regard
to
the
rights
of
a
third
person
rights
which
in
the
common
judgment
of
all
sober
men
may
be
sufficient
to
counterbalance
any
obligation
in
either
of
the
persons
engaged
in
the
treaty
to
make
a
full
disclosure
of
his
views
and
these
principles
duly
considered
will
supply
many
inferences
to
reconcile
any
seeming
contradiction
in
the
opinions
that
have
been
advanced
xii
in
the
first
place
many
things
may
be
said
to
madmen
or
children
the
literal
meaning
of
which
may
not
be
true
without
incurring
the
guilt
of
wilful
falsehood
a
practice
which
seems
to
be
allowed
by
the
common
sense
of
all
mankind
quintilian
speaking
of
the
age
of
puerility
says
it
is
a
period
of
life
when
many
useful
truths
may
be
taught
in
the
dress
of
another
reason
given
is
that
as
children
and
madmen
possess
no
perfect
power
of
judging
impositions
of
that
kind
can
do
no
injury
to
their
rights
in
such
respects
xiii
secondly
when
a
conversation
is
addressed
to
any
one
who
is
not
thereby
deceived
although
a
third
person
not
immediately
addressed
may
misconceive
the
matter
there
is
no
wilful
falsehood
in
the
case
no
wilful
falsehood
towards
the
person
addressed
because
he
feels
no
greater
injury
from
thence
than
an
intelligent
hearer
would
do
from
the
recital
of
a
fable
or
the
use
of
a
metaphor
irony
or
hyperbole
in
speech
it
can
not
be
said
that
an
injury
is
done
to
the
person
who
accidentally
and
cursorily
hears
a
matter
and
misconceives
it
for
being
no
way
concerned
there
is
no
obligation
due
to
him
as
he
misconceives
a
thing
addressed
to
another
and
not
to
himself
he
must
take
upon
his
own
head
all
the
consequences
of
the
mistake
for
properly
speaking
the
discourse
with
respect
to
him
is
no
discourse
but
an
inexpressive
sound
that
may
signify
one
thing
as
well
as
another
so
that
there
was
nothing
wrong
in
the
conduct
of
cato
the
censor
who
made
a
false
promise
of
assistance
to
his
confederates
nor
in
that
of
flaccus
who
informed
others
that
aemilius
had
taken
the
enemy
city
by
storm
although
the
enemy
were
deceived
by
it
plutarch
mentions
an
instance
of
the
same
kind
in
the
life
of
agesilaus
here
no
communication
was
made
to
the
enemy
and
the
prejudice
he
sustained
was
an
accidental
thing
no
way
unlawful
in
itself
either
to
be
wished
for
or
procured
xiv
in
the
third
place
whenever
it
is
certain
that
the
person
on
whom
a
deception
is
practised
discovers
that
the
intent
of
it
was
to
do
him
a
service
he
will
not
feel
it
as
a
grievance
nor
can
it
come
under
the
strict
denomination
of
a
lie
or
falsehood
it
will
be
no
more
an
injury
than
it
would
be
a
theft
in
any
one
presuming
upon
an
owner
consent
to
take
something
belonging
to
that
owner
in
order
to
convert
it
to
his
use
in
a
very
beneficial
way
for
in
cases
of
notorious
certainty
a
presumption
may
be
taken
for
express
consent
but
it
is
evident
that
no
man
would
consent
to
receive
an
injury
from
hence
it
appears
that
a
person
is
guilty
of
no
treachery
who
uses
unfounded
or
fictitious
motives
to
console
a
friend
in
distress
as
arria
did
to
paetus
upon
the
death
of
his
son
of
which
there
is
an
account
in
pliny
epistles
or
in
a
general
who
in
a
perilous
situation
should
avail
himself
of
false
intelligence
to
encourage
his
troops
by
which
perhaps
a
victory
might
be
gained
it
may
be
observed
likewise
that
the
injury
done
to
the
freedom
of
judgment
is
in
such
a
case
of
less
consequence
because
it
is
but
momentary
and
the
real
fact
is
soon
discovered
xv
there
is
a
fourth
case
which
bears
a
near
affinity
to
those
above
mentioned
and
that
is
when
any
one
possessing
authority
orders
another
in
a
subordinate
capacity
to
execute
some
device
or
stratagem
conducive
either
to
his
individual
or
to
the
public
welfare
which
plato
seems
to
have
had
particularly
in
view
in
allowing
those
in
authority
to
avail
themselves
of
pretexts
or
stratagems
the
same
writer
is
very
correct
in
his
notion
of
not
making
such
a
device
a
characteristic
of
that
authority
which
belongs
to
the
supreme
being
for
all
such
devices
however
justifiable
they
may
be
in
certain
cases
strongly
betray
that
imperfection
which
is
inseparable
from
all
human
systems
the
stratagem
which
joseph
employed
to
obtain
further
discoveries
without
making
himself
known
to
his
brethren
is
much
commended
by
philo
as
a
mark
of
great
policy
when
contrary
to
the
convictions
and
feelings
of
his
own
mind
he
accused
them
of
being
spies
and
afterwards
charged
them
with
theft
it
was
by
a
stratagem
of
the
same
kind
that
solomon
gave
proof
of
his
inspired
wisdom
when
he
used
the
fictitious
threat
of
dividing
the
living
child
in
order
to
discover
the
real
mother
xvi
the
fifth
case
which
allows
a
stratagem
to
be
practised
is
that
where
it
may
be
the
only
means
of
saving
the
life
of
an
innocent
person
of
obtaining
some
object
of
equal
importance
or
of
diverting
another
from
the
perpetration
of
some
horrid
design
the
heathen
poet
has
given
a
beautiful
illustration
of
this
in
his
praises
of
hypermnestra
whose
conduct
he
calls
a
splendid
stratagem
ennobling
the
virgin
to
all
posterity
xvii
it
is
evident
that
many
writers
of
acknowledged
wisdom
and
sober
judgment
have
carried
the
point
farther
than
has
been
done
in
this
treatise
in
allowing
the
use
of
false
representations
to
an
enemy
in
cases
where
public
enemies
are
concerned
they
maintain
that
it
is
lawful
to
deviate
from
those
strict
rules
of
avowing
and
disclosing
all
our
intentions
which
they
prescribe
on
all
other
occasions
such
is
the
opinion
of
plato
and
xenophon
among
the
greeks
of
philo
among
the
jews
and
chrysostom
among
christians
it
may
not
perhaps
be
amiss
to
cite
in
this
place
the
message
sent
by
the
men
of
jabesh
gilead
to
the
ammonites
by
whom
they
were
besieged
and
also
that
of
the
prophet
elisha
and
at
the
same
time
to
mention
the
conduct
of
valerius
laevinus
who
boasted
of
having
killed
pyrrhus
the
third
the
fourth
and
fifth
observations
above
made
may
be
illustrated
from
what
is
said
by
eustratus
archbishop
of
nice
an
able
and
upright
counsellor
is
not
obliged
to
disclose
the
whole
truth
for
there
may
be
occasions
when
it
may
be
necessary
for
him
to
recommend
the
means
of
deceiving
an
enemy
or
to
employ
some
stratagem
towards
a
friend
where
it
may
turn
to
his
advantage
xviii
what
has
been
said
of
false
speaking
must
be
understood
as
applied
to
affirmative
declarations
which
can
be
prejudicial
to
no
persons
but
public
enemies
it
can
by
no
means
be
taken
to
include
promises
for
promises
confer
upon
the
person
to
whom
they
are
made
a
peculiar
right
to
claim
their
full
performance
and
this
is
a
rule
which
must
take
place
even
between
public
enemies
a
rule
to
which
existing
hostilities
are
not
allowed
to
form
an
exception
it
is
a
maxim
proper
to
be
enforced
in
tacit
as
well
as
in
express
agreements
as
when
a
parley
or
conference
is
demanded
there
is
always
an
implied
promise
that
both
sides
shall
attend
it
with
perfect
safety
but
these
are
points
reserved
for
the
discussion
of
another
part
of
this
treatise
xix
it
will
be
necessary
to
repeat
an
observation
made
before
with
respect
to
oaths
both
of
the
affirmative
and
promissory
kind
where
it
was
maintained
that
they
exclude
all
exceptions
all
mental
reservations
towards
the
person
to
whom
they
are
made
being
regarded
not
merely
as
a
solemn
transaction
with
that
individual
but
as
a
stedfast
appeal
to
god
such
an
appeal
to
the
supreme
being
demands
the
performance
of
an
oath
even
if
it
gave
the
individual
no
right
to
the
same
at
the
same
time
it
was
observed
that
a
sworn
declaration
is
not
like
one
of
any
other
kind
where
an
application
of
terms
different
from
their
usual
meaning
may
supply
the
speaker
with
an
excuse
for
evading
their
import
but
truth
requires
every
declaration
and
promise
to
be
made
in
terms
which
it
is
supposed
that
every
man
of
integrity
and
clear
judgment
will
understand
spurning
at
the
impious
thought
that
men
may
be
deceived
by
oaths
as
children
are
by
toys
and
trifles
xx
some
nations
and
individuals
indeed
have
rejected
the
use
of
those
stratagems
which
even
the
law
of
nature
allows
to
be
employed
as
a
means
of
against
an
enemy
but
they
did
so
not
from
any
opinion
of
their
unlawfulness
but
from
a
noble
loftiness
of
mind
and
from
a
confidence
in
their
own
strength
aelian
has
preserved
a
saying
of
pythagoras
that
there
are
two
things
in
which
man
approaches
nearest
to
god
in
always
speaking
the
truth
and
doing
good
to
others
aristotle
somewhere
in
his
ethics
calls
speaking
truth
the
freedom
of
a
great
soul
and
plutarch
says
that
falsehood
is
the
qualification
of
a
slave
but
an
adherence
to
truth
in
simplicity
of
heart
is
not
the
only
duty
required
of
christians
in
this
respect
they
are
commanded
to
abstain
from
all
vain
discourse
as
having
for
their
example
him
in
whose
mouth
there
was
found
no
guile
xxi
with
respect
to
the
actions
of
men
there
is
another
rule
which
may
properly
come
under
this
head
and
that
is
the
unlawfulness
of
urging
or
persuading
any
one
to
do
an
unlawful
act
for
instance
no
subject
has
a
right
to
lift
his
hand
against
his
sovereign
to
deliver
up
a
town
without
public
authority
or
to
despoil
his
neighbour
of
his
goods
it
would
be
unlawful
then
to
encourage
the
subject
of
an
enemy
as
long
as
he
continues
his
subject
to
do
any
of
these
acts
for
the
person
who
urges
another
to
do
a
wicked
act
makes
himself
a
partner
in
his
guilt
nor
can
it
be
received
as
a
just
answer
that
urging
a
subject
to
the
perpetration
of
such
a
deed
is
nothing
more
than
employing
the
lawful
means
of
destroying
an
enemy
for
though
it
may
be
necessary
and
just
to
destroy
him
if
possible
yet
that
is
not
the
way
in
which
it
should
be
done
augustin
has
well
observed
that
it
makes
no
difference
whether
any
one
should
commit
a
crime
himself
or
employ
another
as
his
instrument
but
employing
the
spontaneous
offers
of
a
deserter
is
not
contrary
to
the
laws
of
war
and
is
a
very
different
action
from
that
of
seducing
a
subject
from
his
allegiance

and

a
frontispiece
to
a
latin
edition
of
grotius
de
jure

ac
pacis

at
amsterdam

is
intended
to
be
symbolical
of

and

the
direction

three
figures
forming
the
central
chapter
ii
in
what
manner
the
law
of

renders
the
property
of

answerable
for
the

of

distinction
made
by
the
law
of
nations
in
this
respect
i
the
rights
accruing
from
the
law
of
nations
are
the
points
next
to
be
considered
which
may
be
referred
either
to
wars
in
general
or
to
those
of
a
particular
description
wars
in
general
are
those
which
properly
first
come
under
notice
by
the
literal
law
of
nature
no
one
is
bound
by
the
actions
of
another
except
the
person
who
succeeds
to
his
property
for
the
introduction
and
establishment
of
property
introduced
and
established
also
the
power
of
transferring
it
with
all
its
incumbrances
the
emperor
zeno
however
pronounces
it
repugnant
to
natural
justice
for
one
man
to
be
molested
for
the
debts
of
another
a
principle
which
gave
rise
to
the
distinctions
in
the
roman
law
that
the
wife
could
not
be
sued
for
her
husband
nor
the
husband
for
his
wife
nor
a
son
for
his
father
nor
a
father
or
mother
for
their
son
nor
as
ulpian
clearly
states
it
could
individuals
be
answerable
for
the
debts
of
the
community
and
more
especially
if
that
community
be
possessed
of
property
indeed
if
that
were
not
the
case
individuals
could
only
be
obliged
to
contribute
their
due
proportion
as
members
of
that
community
seneca
says
if
any
one
lends
money
to
my
country
i
am
not
to
be
considered
as
his
debtor
nor
to
take
the
debt
upon
myself
though
i
am
bound
to
pay
my
due
proportion
of
it
there
was
a
special
provision
made
in
the
roman
law
that
one
peasant
should
not
be
bound
for
the
debts
of
another
and
it
is
laid
down
as
a
rule
that
the
goods
of
one
person
shall
not
be
distrained
for
the
debts
of
another
even
if
they
be
public
debts
and
in
justinian
novels
pledges
for
others
are
forbidden
and
the
cause
assigned
for
it
is
because
it
is
unreasonable
that
one
person
should
incur
the
debt
and
another
be
bound
to
the
payment
of
it
an
exaction
to
which
the
name
of
odious
is
given
king
theodoric
cassiodor
calls
it
a
shocking
licence
for
one
man
to
be
detained
as
a
pledge
for
another
ii
although
in
the
preceding
observations
there
may
be
a
great
deal
of
truth
yet
it
is
possible
and
indeed
appears
actually
to
be
the
case
that
the
voluntary
law
of
nations
introduced
the
practice
of
rendering
all
the
corporeal
and
incorporeal
property
belonging
to
the
subjects
of
any
state
or
sovereign
liable
to
the
debts
which
that
state
or
sovereign
may
have
incurred
either
personally
or
by
refusing
to
make
such
reparation
as
may
be
due
for
the
injuries
and
aggressions
which
they
have
committed
yet
this
is
a
practice
which
nothing
but
necessity
could
justify
for
on
any
other
ground
it
would
be
opening
a
door
to
innumerable
acts
of
wanton
aggression
and
injustice
against
individuals
as
the
property
of
states
and
sovereigns
can
not
often
so
easily
fall
into
an
enemy
hand
as
that
belonging
to
individuals
who
are
more
numerous
and
whose
property
is
consequently
more
exposed
so
that
rights
of
this
kind
are
to
be
reckoned
among
those
which
justinian
says
are
the
offspring
of
stern
necessity
the
calamities
of
men
driving
them
to
the
use
of
such
means
but
though
a
practice
like
this
owes
its
introduction
to
necessity
it
is
not
so
far
at
variance
with
the
law
of
nature
as
to
exclude
custom
and
tacit
agreement
from
having
some
share
in
its
establishment
for
we
find
that
sureties
are
bound
by
no
other
tie
but
that
alone
of
having
given
their
consent
besides
it
might
easily
be
supposed
that
it
was
the
best
method
of
redress
against
the
subjects
of
another
state
where
the
aggrieved
persons
could
not
so
easily
prosecute
their
rights
or
obtain
indemnities
the
claims
or
injuries
of
strangers
being
but
little
understood
and
perhaps
still
less
regarded
in
a
foreign
land
subjects
being
thus
liable
to
the
loss
of
their
property
by
the
conduct
of
their
fellow
subjects
or
by
that
of
the
state
might
sometimes
feel
it
a
hardship
while
on
other
occasions
it
would
prove
their
greatest
security
against
aggressions
from
the
subjects
of
another
power
that
this
was
a
received
custom
appears
not
only
from
the
regular
wars
carried
on
by
one
state
against
another
the
rules
observed
in
which
are
often
named
in
the
manifestoes
issued
on
such
occasions
the
form
of
which
may
be
seen
in
the
first
book
of
livy
where
it
is
said
i
declare
war
against
the
ancient
nations
of
the
latins
and
likewise
against
the
respective
individuals
and
the
same
writer
in
his
thirty
first
book
informs
us
that
upon
the
question
being
put
to
the
people
they
were
asked
whether
it
was
their
pleasure
that
war
should
be
declared
against
philip
and
against
the
macedonians
his
but
the
same
custom
also
prevailed
even
before
the
commencement
of
actual
and
open
hostilities
between
two
states
when
mutual
acts
of
aggression
by
the
subjects
of
each
power
could
be
regarded
as
nothing
but
the
eve
and
prelude
to
a
declaration
of
war
the
words
used
by
agesilaus
to
pharnabazus
will
serve
to
elucidate
this
point
he
said
while
we
were
friends
to
the
king
of
persia
we
treated
him
and
his
subjects
in
a
friendly
manner
now
we
are
enemies
you
can
expect
nothing
from
us
but
hostilities
therefore
pharnabazus
while
you
chuse
to
continue
a
vassal
to
the
king
we
wound
him
through
your
sides
iii
the
athenians
had
a
method
somewhat
like
this
of
seeking
redress
which
they
called
ἀνδροληψια
androlêpsia
a
seizure
of
men
persons
which
was
laid
down
in
the
attic
law
in
the
following
terms
if
any
one
has
been
murdered
in
a
foreign
country
the
nearest
relatives
of
the
deceased
are
authorized
to
seize
any
three
subjects
of
that
country
but
not
more
than
three
till
the
perpetrators
of
the
deed
be
punished
or
at
least
delivered
up
to
the
hands
of
justice
for
that
purpose
in
this
case
we
find
that
the
personal
liberty
of
subjects
which
may
be
considered
as
a
kind
of
incorporeal
right
including
the
right
of
residing
where
they
please
or
doing
whatever
they
may
think
proper
is
made
answerable
for
the
debt
of
the
state
who
is
bound
to
punish
the
criminal
acts
of
her
subjects
so
that
the
subject
suffers
constraint
till
the
state
has
discharged
the
debt
which
it
is
bound
to
pay
and
by
the
payment
of
this
debt
is
meant
the
punishment
of
the
guilty
for
although
the
egyptians
as
we
learn
from
diodorus
siculus
maintained
that
neither
the
person
nor
liberty
of
any
one
ought
to
be
bound
or
constrained
for
a
debt
there
is
nothing
in
it
repugnant
to
the
law
of
nature
and
by
the
practice
not
only
of
the
greeks
but
of
other
nations
the
opposite
opinion
seems
to
have
been
established
aristocrates
who
was
contemporary
with
demosthenes
had
made
a
motion
for
a
decree
that
if
any
one
killed
charidemus
it
might
be
lawful
to
seize
him
wherever
he
was
to
be
found
and
that
any
one
who
attempted
to
rescue
that
person
should
be
deemed
an
enemy
demosthenes
finds
fault
with
many
parts
of
this
decree
for
in
the
first
place
aristocrates
had
omitted
making
a
proper
distinction
between
murder
and
a
lawful
putting
to
death
the
latter
of
which
is
an
act
of
justice
in
the
next
place
he
has
said
nothing
of
bringing
the
person
to
a
regular
trial
besides
it
was
not
the
persons
among
whom
the
murder
had
been
committed
but
those
who
afterwards
received
the
murderer
that
were
to
be
declared
enemies
demosthenes
says
that
the
regular
law
prescribes
that
if
the
persons
in
whose
district
a
murder
has
been
committed
neither
punish
nor
deliver
up
the
perpetrator
of
the
crime
three
of
their
people
shall
be
liable
to
be
seized
but
this
decree
allowing
the
persons
in
whose
district
it
has
been
committed
to
escape
with
impunity
not
even
naming
them
passes
sentence
upon
those
who
in
conformity
to
the
common
laws
of
humanity
have
received
the
fugitive
if
they
do
not
deliver
him
up
which
would
be
a
breach
of
the
protection
due
to
a
suppliant
the
fourth
point
in
which
he
blames
aristocrates
is
for
having
carried
matters
to
the
extremities
of
open
and
actual
war
in
a
case
where
the
law
only
authorized
the
seizure
and
detention
of
particular
persons
of
these
arguments
the
first
the
second
and
the
fourth
are
by
no
means
destitute
of
weight
but
the
third
argument
unless
it
be
confined
entirely
to
the
circumstance
of
accidental
death
or
that
necessarily
occasioned
by
defending
one
self
may
be
regarded
more
as
an
oratorical
flourish
than
a
just
and
solid
reason
for
the
law
of
nations
extends
the
privileges
and
character
of
suppliants
to
those
only
who
have
left
their
country
on
account
of
misfortune
and
not
owing
to
crimes
indeed
if
the
law
of
nations
made
no
such
distinction
the
persons
among
whom
a
crime
has
been
committed
and
who
may
be
suspected
of
having
countenanced
the
deed
and
those
who
barely
refuse
to
punish
or
deliver
up
the
guilty
fugitive
would
be
upon
an
equal
footing
as
to
right
so
that
it
was
either
usage
which
gradually
introduced
the
above
interpretation
of
that
law
to
which
demosthenes
appeals
or
it
was
afterwards
more
expressly
established
in
order
to
avoid
such
cavils
for
no
one
can
deny
the
truth
of
one
of
these
positions
who
has
attended
to
the
observation
of
julius
pollux
that
the
seizure
and
detainder
of
persons
can
be
enforced
whenever
a
power
can
not
obtain
the
surrender
of
fugitive
murderers
which
they
demand
in
this
case
the
aggrieved
power
or
individual
may
seize
and
detain
any
three
of
the
people
belonging
to
the
state
which
refuses
to
make
that
surrender
it
is
upon
the
same
principle
that
any
power
may
detain
the
subjects
of
another
state
in
order
to
procure
the
release
of
any
subjects
of
her
own
unjustly
seized
and
imprisoned
by
that
state
iv
another
method
of
obtaining
redress
for
any
violation
of
persons
or
property
is
by
having
recourse
to
what
in
modern
language
are
called
reprisals
which
the
saxons
and
angles
denominated
withernam
and
to
which
the
french
gave
the
name
of
letters
of
marque
and
those
were
usually
obtained
from
the
crown
it
is
generally
understood
that
recourse
may
be
had
to
this
method
of
redress
not
only
against
a
foreign
aggressor
but
also
against
a
debtor
if
justice
can
not
be
obtained
in
due
time
but
in
notorious
cases
which
admit
of
no
doubt
this
right
may
be
enforced
even
beyond
the
strict
letter
of
the
law
for
even
in
doubtful
matters
the
presumption
will
always
be
in
favour
of
judges
appointed
by
public
authority
for
it
is
unlikely
that
they
should
greatly
or
wantonly
exceed
their
power
especially
when
if
so
inclined
they
have
not
the
same
means
of
enforcing
their
decrees
against
foreigners
as
against
their
fellow
subjects
indeed
even
in
disputes
between
subjects
of
the
same
country
they
can
not
annul
a
just
debt
paulus
the
lawyer
says
that
a
real
debtor
though
discharged
owing
to
some
informality
or
inability
of
the
law
to
enforce
payment
still
remains
a
debtor
according
to
the
law
of
nature
and
when
in
consequence
of
a
judicial
sentence
a
creditor
under
pretext
of
seizing
his
own
property
had
taken
from
a
debtor
something
which
did
not
belong
to
him
though
it
was
in
his
possession
upon
the
discharge
of
the
debt
a
doubt
arising
whether
the
thing
should
be
restored
to
the
debtor
scaevola
maintained
that
it
certainly
ought
to
be
restored
there
is
a
difference
between
the
two
cases
for
subjects
as
such
can
not
make
any
violent
resistance
to
the
execution
of
a
sentence
which
they
may
not
deem
satisfactory
nor
can
they
prosecute
any
right
in
opposition
to
the
law
foreigners
may
use
violent
means
to
enforce
a
right
tho
they
are
not
justified
in
using
such
means
while
there
is
any
possibility
of
obtaining
redress
in
a
legal
and
peaceable
manner
it
is
on
such
grounds
that
reprisals
are
made
upon
the
persons
and
property
of
the
subjects
belonging
to
a
power
who
refuses
to
grant
redress
and
reparation
for
injuries
and
aggressions
it
is
a
practice
not
literally
enacted
by
the
law
of
nature
but
generally
received
through
custom
it
is
a
practice
too
of
the
greatest
antiquity
for
in
the
eleventh
book
of
the
iliad
we
find
nestor
giving
an
account
of
the
reprisals
which
he
had
made
upon
the
epeian
nation
from
whom
he
took
a
great
number
of
cattle
as
a
satisfaction
for
a
prize
which
his
father
neleus
had
won
at
the
elian
games
and
for
debts
due
to
many
private
subjects
of
the
pylian
kingdom
out
of
this
booty
the
king
having
selected
his
own
due
equitably
divided
the
rest
among
the
other
creditors
vi
it
has
been
a
received
opinion
with
many
nations
that
reprisals
might
be
made
even
upon
the
lives
of
innocent
subjects
owing
to
the
right
which
it
was
supposed
that
every
one
had
over
his
own
life
and
which
might
be
transferred
from
the
individual
to
the
state
a
doctrine
which
as
it
was
proved
in
the
first
book
of
this
treatise
can
never
be
reconciled
either
to
sound
religion
or
morality
indeed
a
person
may
accidentally
though
not
intentionally
be
killed
by
us
in
attempting
to
prevent
him
from
violently
obstructing
us
in
the
prosecution
of
a
lawful
right
yet
if
such
an
accidental
calamity
could
be
foreseen
the
law
of
charity
setting
so
a
value
upon
the
life
of
man
would
in
such
a
case
prescribe
the
forbearance
of
our
right
vii
but
on
this
as
well
as
other
points
we
must
take
care
not
to
confound
the
natural
and
fundamental
law
of
nations
with
the
civil
and
conventional
law
of
particular
states
by
the
law
of
nations
all
the
permanent
subjects
both
natives
and
settlers
of
an
offending
state
or
sovereign
are
liable
to
suffer
reprisals
but
the
same
rule
does
not
bind
those
who
are
passing
through
a
country
or
only
residing
in
it
for
a
time
for
such
reprisals
are
a
kind
of
pledges
like
public
burdens
made
answerable
for
the
public
debts
from
which
foreigners
being
temporary
residents
though
owing
obedience
to
the
laws
are
totally
exempt
in
the
same
manner
ambassadors
but
not
those
sent
from
an
enemy
to
our
enemies
and
their
property
are
exempt
from
such
conditions
by
the
law
of
nations
by
the
civil
law
too
of
many
countries
an
exception
is
made
in
favour
of
women
and
children
of
men
of
letters
and
those
who
are
travelling
for
the
purposes
of
trade
but
by
the
law
of
nations
the
goods
of
all
are
liable
to
reprisals
as
was
the
case
at
athens
respecting
the
seizure
of
persons
in
many
places
by
the
civil
law
the
right
of
making
reprisals
is
obtained
of
the
sovereign
and
in
others
of
the
judges
by
the
law
of
nations
the
property
of
all
captures
is
devoted
to
discharge
the
debt
and
defray
the
expenses
incurred
the
remainder
of
which
after
due
satisfaction
obtained
and
peace
concluded
should
be
restored
by
the
civil
law
the
persons
interested
are
summoned
to
appear
the
property
is
sold
by
public
authority
and
the
money
accruing
from
thence
divided
among
all
who
are
entitled
to
a
share
of
the
same
but
these
and
other
points
of
the
same
kind
are
to
be
learned
from
civilians
who
are
conversant
in
such
matters
and
particularly
from
bartolus
who
has
written
upon
reprisals
this
subject
may
be
closed
with
one
observation
that
will
in
some
measure
tend
to
soften
the
rigour
of
this
stern
but
necessary
right
and
that
observation
is
that
such
as
by
not
discharging
a
debt
or
granting
redress
have
occasioned
reprisals
to
be
made
are
bound
in
justice
and
honour
to
make
good
the
losses
of
those
who
have
thereby
suffered

whether
the

of
an
ambassador
rights
to
be
a
just
ground
of
war
i
in
the
first
book
of
this
treatise
it
was
observed
that
according
to
the
best
writers
a
war
is
defined
to
be
just
not
on
account
of
the
causes
solely
in
which
it
originates
nor
on
account
of
the
magnitude
of
its
objects
but
from
certain
peculiar
effects
of
right
with
which
it
is
attended
but
to
what
kind
of
war
such
an
appellation
most
duly
belongs
will
be
best
understood
by
considering
the
definition
which
the
roman
lawyers
have
given
of
a
public
or
national
enemy
those
are
public
and
lawful
enemies
with
whose
state
our
own
is
engaged
in
war
but
enemies
of
every
other
description
come
under
the
denomination
of
pirates
and
robbers
with
that
opinion
ulpian
entirely
accords
making
an
additional
observation
that
if
any
one
be
taken
by
robbers
as
he
is
not
a
lawful
prisoner
of
war
he
can
not
claim
of
his
own
state
the
right
of
postliminium
but
if
he
be
taken
prisoner
by
a
public
enemy
of
the
state
being
considered
as
a
prisoner
of
war
he
is
entitled
by
the
right
of
postliminium
to
be
restored
to
his
former
condition
these
opinions
are
supported
by
that
of
paulus
who
maintains
that
persons
captured
by
pirates
still
continue
free
that
is
are
not
to
be
considered
as
prisoners
for
whom
an
exchange
may
be
demanded
so
that
by
the
opinion
of
the
roman
lawyers
it
is
evident
that
no
war
is
considered
to
be
lawful
regular
and
formal
except
that
which
is
begun
and
carried
on
by
the
sovereign
power
of
each
country
cicero
in
his
fourth
philippic
describes
a
public
and
authorised
enemy
to
be
the
person
who
possesses
the
civil
and
military
powers
of
the
state
who
can
command
the
treasury
and
the
services
of
the
people
in
support
of
his
measures
and
who
as
occasions
offer
has
power
to
conclude
treaties
of
peace
and
amity
ii
a
state
though
it
may
commit
some
act
of
aggression
or
injustice
does
not
thereby
lose
its
political
capacity
nor
can
a
band
of
pirates
or
robbers
ever
become
a
state
although
they
may
preserve
among
themselves
that
degree
of
subordination
which
is
absolutely
necessary
to
the
subsistence
of
all
society
for
with
the
latter
the
commission
of
crime
is
the
sole
bond
of
union
whereas
the
former
though
not
always
free
from
blame
but
occasionally
deviating
from
the
laws
of
nature
which
in
many
cases
have
been
in
a
great
measure
obliterated
still
regulate
their
conduct
by
the
treaties
which
they
have
made
and
certain
customs
that
have
been
established
being
united
among
themselves
for
the
mutual
support
of
lawful
rights
and
connected
with
foreign
states
by
known
rules
of
standing
polity
the
scholiast
upon
thucydides
remarks
that
the
greeks
at
the
time
when
piracy
was
reckoned
lawful
forebore
committing
massacres
or
nightly
depredations
and
carrying
off
the
oxen
that
were
necessary
for
the
plough
we
are
informed
by
strabo
that
other
nations
too
who
lived
by
plunder
after
they
had
returned
home
from
their
predatory
voyages
sent
messages
to
the
owners
whom
they
had
plundered
to
know
if
they
would
redeem
the
captures
at
a
fair
price
in
morals
the
whole
system
often
derives
its
name
from
some
one
of
the
principal
parts
as
cicero
remarks
in
the
fifth
book
of
his
bounds
of
good
and
evil
and
galen
observes
that
a
mixture
is
often
called
by
the
name
of
its
chief
ingredient
so
that
cicero
is
not
altogether
correct
in
saying
that
a
state
is
not
merely
diseased
but
entirely
destroyed
by
the
injustice
of
its
component
and
leading
members
for
a
morbid
body
is
still
a
body
and
a
state
though
dreadfully
diseased
is
still
a
political
being
as
long
as
its
laws
and
tribunals
and
other
necessary
parts
of
its
constitution
remain
to
administer
justice
and
give
redress
to
foreigners
no
less
than
to
private
subjects
in
their
actions
against
each
other
there
is
a
beautiful
observation
in
dion
chrysostom
who
compares
the
law
of
a
state
particularly
that
branch
of
it
relating
to
the
law
of
nations
to
the
body
animated
by
the
soul
upon
the
departure
of
which
the
corporeal
frame
becomes
a
mass
of
lifeless
clay
in
the
same
manner
political
society
can
not
subsist
without
the
guiding
and
controuling
principle
of
law
aristides
encouraging
the
rhodians
to
harmony
observes
that
even
under
a
tyrannical
government
many
good
laws
may
be
found
these
are
points
which
may
be
cleared
up
by
examples
thus
ulpian
maintains
that
those
who
are
captured
by
pirates
can
not
be
considered
as
prisoners
of
war
but
if
captured
by
the
germans
for
instance
or
any
national
enemy
they
lose
their
liberty
for
a
time
but
the
germans
as
we
are
informed
by
caesar
thought
acts
of
plunder
if
committed
in
a
foreign
territory
no
disgrace
tacitus
says
that
the
cattians
a
noble
race
of
people
in
germany
and
the
garamantians
were
addicted
to
the
same
habits
of
plunder
yet
still
retained
their
rank
among
such
is
the
difference
between
a
national
and
political
body
and
a
band
of
men
uniting
together
solely
for
the
commission
of
crimes
iii
a
change
may
occur
not
only
in
the
situations
of
individuals
as
in
those
of
jephthah
arsaces
and
viriatus
who
from
being
leaders
of
voluntary
bands
became
lawful
commanders
but
the
same
has
also
happened
with
respect
to
whole
communities
which
being
originally
composed
of
nothing
but
freebooters
have
by
the
gradual
course
and
changes
of
time
risen
to
the
rank
and
dignity
of
states
iv
what
has
been
said
with
respect
to
the
right
of
making
formal
and
lawful
war
being
vested
in
the
sovereign
power
alone
includes
those
who
have
any
share
in
the
sovereign
power
as
the
different
communities
forming
the
states
general
of
many
commonwealths
the
same
rule
will
hold
good
of
those
who
are
not
subjects
of
a
superior
state
but
joined
to
it
in
confederacy
by
an
unequal
treaty
innumerable
instances
of
which
are
to
be
found
in
history
this
was
the
case
between
the
romans
and
their
allies
the
volscians
the
latins
and
the
spaniards
and
all
whom
we
read
of
being
engaged
in
wars
which
were
considered
as
lawful
and
just
but
to
make
a
war
just
according
to
this
meaning
it
must
not
only
be
carried
on
by
the
sovereign
authority
on
both
sides
but
it
must
also
be
duly
and
formally
declared
and
declared
in
such
a
manner
as
to
be
known
to
each
of
the
belligerent
powers
cicero
in
the
first
book
of
his
offices
points
out
the
equity
of
the
rules
prescribed
by
the
roman
law
for
the
declaration
of
war
from
whence
it
may
be
concluded
that
no
war
is
regular
or
just
but
such
as
is
undertaken
to
compel
restitution
and
to
procure
indemnity
for
injuries
and
that
too
accompanied
with
a
formal
declaration
livy
also
in
the
same
manner
deems
an
observance
of
these
rules
requisite
to
form
the
characteristic
of
a
just
war
and
describing
an
incursion
of
the
acarnanians
into
attica
and
their
ravaging
the
country
he
says
that
those
acts
of
irritation
ended
in
a
declaration
of
just
and
regular
war
on
both
sides
vi
in
order
to
understand
all
these
points
clearly
respecting
the
declaration
of
war
an
accurate
distinction
must
be
made
between
the
principles
which
are
founded
on
the
law
of
nature
itself
and
those
which
though
not
derived
immediately
from
that
source
are
still
found
to
be
just
it
will
be
necessary
also
to
examine
what
is
required
by
the
law
of
nations
towards
obtaining
in
war
all
the
consequences
privileges
and
effects
of
that
law
and
at
the
same
time
to
investigate
the
consequences
and
rights
arising
from
the
peculiar
laws
and
customs
of
particular
nations
to
repel
force
or
to
punish
a
delinquent
the
law
of
nature
requires
no
declaration
and
as
thucydides
relates
sthenelaidas
one
of
the
ephori
maintains
that
where
we
have
been
injured
not
by
words
but
by
actions
the
matter
can
not
be
decided
by
words
and
forms
and
aelian
after
plato
observes
that
it
is
not
the
declaration
of
the
herald
but
the
voice
and
law
of
nature
which
proclaim
war
undertaken
to
repel
force
hence
dion
chrysostom
in
addressing
the
nicomedians
says
that
many
wars
are
begun
without
any
declaration
upon
the
same
ground
livy
condemns
the
conduct
of
menippus
a
general
belonging
to
antiochus
for
having
killed
some
roman
citizens
before
any
declaration
of
war
had
been
made
or
even
before
a
sword
had
been
drawn
or
a
drop
of
blood
spilt
to
shew
that
hostilities
were
intended
by
this
objection
he
proves
that
either
a
formal
declaration
or
some
act
indicative
of
hostilities
was
deemed
requisite
to
justify
actual
warfare
neither
if
we
follow
the
law
of
nature
is
there
any
more
occasion
for
notice
or
declaration
where
an
owner
intends
to
lay
hands
upon
his
own
property
but
whenever
one
thing
is
taken
in
return
for
another
or
the
property
of
a
debtor
is
seized
for
the
recovery
of
a
debt
and
especially
if
any
one
intends
seizing
the
property
of
those
who
are
subjects
to
the
debtor
a
formal
demand
must
be
made
as
a
proof
that
recourse
to
such
security
is
the
only
means
left
of
obtaining
redress
and
satisfaction
such
a
demand
is
necessary
because
that
is
not
a
primary
and
original
right
but
a
secondary
right
substituted
in
the
place
of
the
primary
and
original
by
the
artificial
rules
of
civil
law
in
the
same
manner
to
justify
an
attack
upon
a
sovereign
power
for
the
aggressions
and
debts
of
its
subjects
a
previous
remonstrance
and
a
proper
demand
of
justice
must
be
made
to
that
power
for
it
is
only
by
refusing
to
punish
the
guilty
or
to
grant
indemnity
to
the
injured
that
states
or
sovereigns
can
be
implicated
in
the
misconduct
of
their
subjects
but
even
where
the
law
of
nature
does
not
directly
prescribe
that
such
a
remonstrance
or
demand
should
be
made
yet
the
common
principles
of
humanity
and
equity
will
recommend
the
use
of
any
means
that
may
prevent
recourse
to
the
calamities
of
war
the
commandment
given
by
god
to
the
hebrews
to
send
a
message
of
peace
to
any
state
or
city
before
they
began
an
intended
attack
was
designed
as
a
special
command
to
that
people
yet
some
have
confounded
it
with
the
general
law
of
nations
for
it
was
not
any
kind
of
peace
that
was
meant
by
that
injunction
but
only
such
a
peace
as
imposed
terms
of
subjection
and
tribute
we
are
informed
by
xenophon
that
when
cyrus
went
into
the
country
of
the
armenians
he
sent
messengers
to
the
king
to
demand
the
tribute
and
number
of
troops
which
had
been
stipulated
by
treaty
but
to
obtain
the
peculiar
rights
and
consequences
resulting
from
the
law
of
nations
a
declaration
of
war
by
one
of
the
parties
at
least
if
not
by
both
is
absolutely
requisite
in
all
cases
vii
those
declarations
are
either
conditional
or
absolute
a
conditional
declaration
is
that
which
is
coupled
with
a
demand
of
restitution
or
redress
under
the
name
of
restitution
the
fecial
law
of
rome
that
is
the
law
respecting
declarations
of
war
comprehended
not
only
the
claims
which
ownership
established
but
the
prosecution
of
every
right
arising
from
criminal
or
civil
causes
hence
the
declarations
were
couched
in
terms
requiring
restoration
satisfaction
or
surrender
here
by
the
term
surrender
the
party
appealed
to
is
understood
to
have
the
option
either
of
punishing
the
offender
himself
or
delivering
him
up
to
the
aggrieved
person
this
manner
of
demanding
restitution
is
according
to
the
testimony
of
pliny
called
clarigation
that
is
a
loud
and
formal
demand
livy
gives
us
an
example
of
a
conditional
and
qualified
declaration
wherein
the
aggrieved
power
denounces
a
determined
resolution
to
prosecute
her
rights
with
the
utmost
violence
if
the
aggressor
will
not
make
reparation
and
atonement
for
the
injury
he
has
done
tacitus
also
relates
the
substance
of
a
dispatch
sent
to
caecina
by
germanicus
wherein
he
declares
that
if
the
ringleaders
of
the
mutinous
and
rebellious
legions
are
not
immediately
punished
he
will
advance
with
his
army
and
put
the
whole
to
the
sword
an
absolute
declaration
of
war
is
issued
where
any
power
has
already
begun
hostilities
or
committed
acts
which
call
for
exemplary
punishment
sometimes
indeed
a
conditional
is
followed
by
an
absolute
war
though
in
such
a
case
the
latter
is
not
actually
necessary
but
only
a
confirmation
of
the
former
this
gave
rise
to
the
form
which
says
an
appeal
is
hereby
made
against
such
a
people
as
unjust
and
refusing
to
grant
redress
there
is
another
form
also
purporting
that
the
principal
herald
of
the
roman
citizens
has
made
known
to
the
principal
herald
of
the
ancient
latins
and
to
the
latin
people
that
redress
is
demanded
of
them
by
just
and
lawful
war
on
account
of
all
the
disputes
which
they
have
refused
to
settle
and
the
indemnities
which
they
have
been
bound
to
grant
and
have
refused
and
that
this
is
the
only
means
remaining
to
recover
all
that
has
been
unjustly
detained
there
is
also
a
third
mode
of
declaration
which
runs
in
the
following
tenour
since
the
ancient
people
of
the
latins
have
committed
aggressions
against
the
people
of
rome
the
people
of
rome
with
the
advice
and
consent
of
the
senate
declare
war
against
them
and
in
the
name
of
the
senate
and
people
of
rome
their
purpose
is
thus
published
but
that
in
case
of
renewed
wars
such
a
declaration
is
not
absolutely
necessary
appears
from
the
circumstance
of
its
being
made
in
due
form
at
the
nearest
garrison
and
not
personally
to
the
offender
himself
according
to
the
answer
given
by
the
heralds
when
they
were
consulted
in
the
case
of
philip
of
macedon
and
afterwards
respecting
antiochus
whereas
a
declaration
for
the
first
time
should
be
made
to
the
enemy
himself
indeed
in
the
war
against
pyrrhus
the
declaration
was
made
to
one
of
his
soldiers
in
the
flaminian
circus
where
as
servius
observes
in
his
notes
on
the
sixth
book
of
the
aeneid
he
was
commanded
to
purchase
a
piece
of
ground
as
a
handle
for
dispute
a
proof
also
that
in
some
cases
a
declaration
is
superfluous
may
be
taken
from
the
circumstance
that
war
is
frequently
declared
by
both
sides
which
was
done
by
the
corcyraeans
and
corinthians
in
the
peloponnesian
war
though
a
declaration
by
one
of
the
parties
would
have
been
sufficient
viii
as
to
the
use
of
the
caduceum
or
staff
with
the
figure
of
two
snakes
twisted
around
it
which
ambassadors
carried
when
they
sued
for
peace
it
was
a
ceremony
peculiar
to
the
greeks
and
not
derived
from
the
general
law
of
nations
the
romans
in
the
same
manner
had
particular
customs
such
as
using
vervain
in
forming
alliances
throwing
a
bloody
spear
as
a
declaration
of
war
renouncing
all
former
friendship
and
alliance
at
the
expiration
of
thirty
days
after
satisfaction
had
been
demanded
and
refused
and
again
throwing
another
spear
none
of
these
peculiar
customs
ought
to
be
confounded
with
the
general
law
of
nations
for
arnobius
informs
us
that
in
his
time
many
of
them
had
fallen
into
disuse
and
even
in
the
time
of
varro
some
of
them
were
omitted
the
third
punic
war
indeed
was
not
declared
till
the
moment
of
its
actual
commencement
ix
a
declaration
of
war
made
against
a
sovereign
includes
not
only
his
own
subjects
but
all
who
are
likely
to
become
his
associates
as
thereby
they
make
themselves
accessories
in
the
war
and
this
is
what
the
modern
lawyers
mean
when
they
say
that
in
bidding
defiance
to
a
prince
we
bid
defiance
to
all
his
associates
for
they
give
the
name
of
defiance
to
a
declaration
of
war
by
which
is
understood
the
war
carried
on
with
the
power
against
whom
it
has
been
declared
thus
upon
war
being
declared
against
antiochus
there
was
no
occasion
for
a
separate
declaration
against
the
aetolians
who
had
openly
joined
antiochus
for
as
the
heralds
in
their
answer
justly
observed
the
aetolians
had
by
that
act
voluntarily
brought
war
upon
themselves
x
but
if
after
the
conclusion
of
such
a
war
it
should
be
deemed
expedient
to
attack
any
other
nation
or
king
for
having
furnished
supplies
and
assistance
towards
that
war
a
new
declaration
of
war
will
be
necessary
for
that
nation
or
king
is
then
to
be
considered
not
as
an
accessory
but
as
a
principal
enemy
and
therefore
it
was
with
reason
said
that
the
war
of
manlius
against
the
galatians
and
that
of
caesar
against
ariovistus
were
not
just
wars
according
to
the
law
of
nations
for
war
was
made
upon
them
not
as
accessories
but
as
principals
so
that
for
this
purpose
as
the
law
of
nations
would
have
required
a
declaration
in
the
same
manner
the
roman
law
would
have
required
a
new
order
of
the
senate
for
on
the
motion
being
made
for
the
war
with
antiochus
the
question
was
also
put
whether
it
should
not
at
the
same
time
be
made
with
his
adherents
the
same
rule
also
being
observed
against
king
perseus
it
must
be
understood
as
including
the
adherents
during
all
the
time
that
war
with
those
princes
continued
and
implicating
all
who
in
reality
gave
them
support
xi
the
reason
why
a
declaration
is
necessary
to
constitute
what
is
deemed
according
to
the
law
of
nations
a
just
war
is
not
that
which
some
writers
assign
for
they
allege
that
it
is
to
prevent
every
appearance
of
clandestine
and
treacherous
dealing
an
openness
which
may
be
dignified
with
the
name
of
magnanimity
rather
than
entitled
a
matter
of
right
on
this
point
we
are
informed
that
some
nations
have
gone
so
far
as
to
settle
and
make
known
the
very
time
and
place
of
a
general
engagement
but
waving
all
conjecture
a
more
satisfactory
reason
may
be
found
in
the
necessity
that
it
should
be
known
for
certain
that
a
war
is
not
the
private
undertaking
of
bold
adventurers
but
made
and
sanctioned
by
the
public
and
sovereign
authority
on
both
sides
so
that
it
is
attended
with
the
effects
of
binding
all
the
subjects
of
the
respective
states
and
it
is
accompanied
also
with
other
consequences
and
rights
which
do
not
belong
to
wars
against
pirates
and
to
civil
wars
xii
there
is
much
truth
indeed
in
the
observations
which
some
have
made
and
which
they
have
produced
examples
to
confirm
that
even
in
wars
of
this
kind
all
captures
become
the
lawful
prize
of
the
captors
yet
this
is
only
partially
true
and
that
too
according
to
the
law
of
nature
and
not
according
to
the
voluntary
law
of
nations
for
the
latter
only
makes
provision
to
secure
the
rights
of
nations
as
whole
communities
and
not
of
those
who
as
in
civil
wars
form
but
one
part
of
a
nation
the
same
writers
are
mistaken
too
in
the
supposition
that
defensive
wars
require
no
declaration
for
it
is
no
less
necessary
to
shew
by
way
of
vindication
that
it
is
a
defensive
war
and
at
the
same
time
by
public
declaration
to
give
it
the
character
of
a
national
and
lawful
war
in
order
to
establish
those
rights
and
consequences
that
have
been
already
mentioned
and
which
will
hereafter
be
more
fully
explained
xiii
they
maintain
another
position
also
which
is
by
no
means
true
and
that
is
that
a
power
ought
not
immediately
to
follow
up
a
declaration
of
war
with
actual
hostilities
as
cyrus
did
to
the
armenians
and
the
romans
to
the
carthaginians
for
the
law
of
nations
requires
the
intervention
of
no
definite
time
between
the
declaration
and
the
commencement
of
war
there
may
indeed
be
some
cases
where
natural
justice
will
render
such
a
delay
proper
thus
for
instance
where
reparation
for
injury
or
the
punishment
of
aggressors
is
demanded
it
is
but
reasonable
to
wait
till
it
can
be
known
whether
the
just
demand
will
be
complied
with
or
rejected
xiv
in
order
to
establish
the
same
consequences
a
declaration
will
be
equally
necessary
too
where
the
rights
of
ambassadors
have
been
violated
yet
it
will
be
sufficient
for
it
to
be
made
in
the
manner
in
which
it
may
be
done
with
the
greatest
safety
as
in
many
other
matters
in
places
which
afford
no
security
satisfaction
is
demanded
by
denunciation
or
summons

servius
in
his
comment
on
the
passage
of
virgil
where
that
poet
says
that
war
will
authorise
mutual
acts
of
destruction
and
rapine
in
tracing
the
fecial
or
herald
law
to
ancus
martius
and
even
beyond
him
to
a
still
more
remote
period
remarks
that
if
ever
the
persons
or
property
of
subjects
belonging
to
the
roman
state
were
seized
and
carried
off
by
any
other
nation
the
principal
herald
or
king
at
arms
went
out
with
the
sacred
ministers
who
presided
at
the
making
of
solemn
treaties
and
proceeding
to
the
verge
of
the
territories
of
the
offending
nation
declared
with
a
loud
voice
the
cause
of
the
war
and
the
refusal
of
that
nation
either
to
restore
what
had
been
seized
or
to
deliver
up
the
aggressors
to
justice
after
this
he
threw
a
spear
to
indicate
that
war
and
all
its
consequences
were
from
that
moment
begun
the
commentator
had
previously
observed
that
the
ancients
gave
the
name
of
rapine
to
every
act
of
hostility
even
where
there
was
no
act
of
plunder
committed
and
they
likewise
called
every
kind
of
restitution
a
satisfaction
by
this
explanation
we
learn
that
whenever
war
is
proclaimed
between
two
states
or
sovereigns
it
is
accompanied
with
certain
rights
or
consequences
which
do
not
necessarily
belong
to
war
itself
and
this
is
perfectly
conformable
to
the
examples
from
the
roman
lawyers
which
have
been
before
produced
ii
but
it
will
be
proper
to
consider
how
far
the
lawfulness
which
virgil
speaks
of
extends
for
the
term
lawful
sometimes
implies
whatever
is
just
and
pious
in
all
respects
although
the
pursuit
of
a
different
course
may
perhaps
be
more
laudable
according
to
the
expression
of
paul
who
says
all
things
are
lawful
to
me
but
all
things
are
not
expedient
ulpian
is
speaking
of
a
seller
who
at
the
expiration
of
a
certain
period
is
not
answerable
for
the
safety
of
goods
which
a
buyer
has
neglected
to
take
away
says
he
will
yet
think
himself
bound
in
equity
to
preserve
them
with
all
imaginable
care
on
some
occasions
when
it
is
said
that
men
may
lawfully
do
a
thing
the
expression
only
means
that
doing
such
act
will
not
subject
them
to
human
and
legal
penalties
but
it
by
no
means
indicates
that
the
action
is
strictly
conformable
to
the
rule
of
religion
and
morality
thus
among
the
lacedaemonians
and
egyptians
stealing
was
allowed
an
indulgence
that
by
no
means
took
away
the
guilt
of
theft
cicero
in
the
fifth
of
his
tusculan
questions
speaking
of
cinna
beautifully
and
justly
points
out
this
abuse
of
the
word
lawful
he
seems
to
me
a
wretched
man
indeed
for
having
done
those
acts
and
for
having
been
in
a
situation
where
they
might
be
thought
lawful
it
can
never
be
lawful
for
any
man
to
do
wrong
but
we
fall
into
a
great
mistake
in
the
use
of
that
word
for
we
consider
a
thing
to
be
lawful
which
any
one
may
do
with
impunity
this
is
the
meaning
in
which
the
term
is
generally
understood
as
the
same
orator
in
addressing
the
judges
in
behalf
of
rabirius
posthumus
observes
it
behoves
you
to
consider
what
is
becoming
your
character
and
not
what
the
rigour
of
the
law
allows
you
to
inflict
for
if
you
consult
the
full
extent
of
your
authority
you
may
make
away
with
any
citizen
you
please
in
the
same
manner
legislators
as
it
was
proved
in
a
former
book
of
this
treatise
are
not
accountable
in
their
legislative
capacity
to
any
human
tribunal
for
the
laws
which
they
make
yet
they
can
not
in
a
moral
point
of
view
avail
themselves
of
this
transcendent
power
to
enact
a
thing
that
is
evidently
unjust
in
this
sense
we
often
meet
with
a
distinction
made
between
what
is
proper
or
right
and
what
is
lawful
thus
cicero
in
his
speech
for
milo
makes
the
law
of
nature
the
standard
of
what
is
right
and
legal
authority
the
standard
of
what
is
lawful
iii
thus
qualified
the
annoyance
of
an
enemy
either
in
his
person
or
property
is
lawful
this
right
extends
not
only
to
the
power
engaged
in
a
just
war
and
who
in
her
hostilities
confines
herself
within
the
practice
established
by
the
law
of
nature
but
each
side
without
distinction
has
a
right
to
employ
the
same
means
of
annoyance
so
that
any
one
taken
in
arms
even
in
another
territory
can
not
be
treated
as
a
robber
malefactor
or
murderer
nor
can
even
that
neutral
power
in
whose
territory
he
is
taken
treat
him
as
an
enemy
for
being
found
in
arms
iv
this
principle
was
established
by
nations
to
prevent
others
from
interfering
in
their
disputes
or
giving
the
law
to
them
respecting
the
rights
of
war
besides
if
this
were
not
the
case
neutral
powers
would
frequently
be
involved
in
the
wars
of
others
a
reason
which
the
people
of
marseilles
urged
in
the
dispute
between
caesar
and
pompey
they
alleged
that
they
had
neither
sufficient
judgment
to
determine
on
which
side
justice
lay
nor
if
they
could
determine
had
they
strength
to
give
effect
to
their
decisions
a
spectator
indeed
is
but
ill
qualified
to
judge
how
far
even
in
the
most
just
war
the
attainment
of
indemnity
or
the
punishment
of
an
aggressor
may
be
carried
these
are
points
which
on
many
if
not
most
occasions
must
be
left
to
the
conscience
and
discretion
of
the
belligerents
themselves
a
mode
far
preferable
to
that
of
appealing
to
the
mediation
and
decision
of
disinterested
and
neutral
powers
livy
has
given
an
address
of
the
achaeans
to
the
senate
in
which
they
ask
how
their
availing
themselves
of
the
rights
of
war
can
ever
be
fairly
called
in
question
or
made
a
subject
of
discussion
besides
the
impunity
attending
certain
actions
done
in
war
the
acquisition
of
territory
by
the
right
of
conquest
is
another
topic
of
consideration
which
will
hereafter
be
examined
the
lawfulness
of
injuring
or
destroying
the
person
of
a
public
enemy
is
supported
by
the
testimony
of
many
of
the
best
writers
both
poets
moralists
and
historians
in
one
of
the
tragedies
of
euripides
there
is
a
proverb
which
says
that
to
kill
a
public
enemy
or
an
enemy
in
war
is
no
murder
therefore
the
custom
of
the
ancient
greeks
which
rendered
it
unlawful
and
impious
to
use
the
same
bath
or
to
partake
of
the
same
festivities
and
sacred
rites
with
a
person
who
had
killed
another
in
time
of
peace
did
not
extend
to
any
one
who
had
killed
a
public
enemy
in
war
killing
an
enemy
is
indeed
everywhere
called
a
right
of
war
the
rights
of
war
marcellus
in
support
me
in
all
that
i
have
done
against
the
enemy
and
the
same
historian
gives
the
address
of
alcon
to
the
saguntines
where
he
says
you
ought
to
bear
these
hardships
rather
than
suffer
your
own
bodies
to
be
mangled
and
your
wives
and
children
to
be
seized
and
dragged
away
before
your
eyes
cicero
in
his
speech
in
defence
of
marcellus
passes
a
high
encomium
upon
the
clemency
of
caesar
who
by
the
laws
of
war
and
the
rights
of
victory
might
have
put
to
death
all
whom
he
had
spared
and
protected
and
caesar
observes
to
the
eduans
that
it
was
an
act
of
kindness
in
him
to
spare
those
whom
the
laws
of
war
would
have
authorised
him
to
put
to
death
but
the
rights
of
war
for
which
these
writers
plead
could
not
perfectly
justify
the
putting
prisoners
to
death
but
could
only
grant
impunity
to
those
who
availed
themselves
of
the
barbarous
custom
there
is
a
wide
difference
however
between
actions
like
these
and
destroying
an
enemy
by
proper
means
of
hostility
for
as
tacitus
says
in
the
leisure
hours
of
peace
the
merits
and
demerits
of
every
case
may
be
examined
and
weighed
but
in
the
tumult
and
confusion
of
war
the
innocent
must
fall
with
the
guilty
and
the
same
writer
in
another
place
observes
that
there
are
many
actions
which
the
principles
of
humanity
can
not
entirely
approve
but
which
the
policy
of
war
requires
and
it
is
in
this
and
no
other
sense
that
lucan
has
said
the
complexion
of
right
may
be
assigned
to
what
is
wrong
vi
this
right
of
making
lawful
what
is
done
in
war
is
of
great
extent
for
in
the
first
place
it
comprises
in
the
number
of
enemies
not
only
those
who
actually
bear
arms
or
who
are
immediately
subjects
of
the
belligerent
power
but
even
all
who
are
within
the
hostile
territories
as
appears
from
the
form
given
by
livy
who
says
that
war
is
declared
against
the
sovereign
and
all
within
his
jurisdiction
for
which
a
very
good
reason
may
be
assigned
because
danger
is
to
be
apprehended
even
from
them
which
in
a
continued
and
regular
war
establishes
the
right
now
under
discussion
reprisals
do
not
come
exactly
under
the
same
rule
for
like
taxes
they
were
introduced
for
the
discharge
of
public
debts
for
no
part
of
which
temporary
residents
or
foreigners
are
answerable
therefore
baldus
is
right
in
his
observation
that
after
war
is
actually
begun
much
greater
latitude
is
allowed
than
in
the
bare
right
of
making
reprisals
so
that
what
is
said
of
foreigners
who
enter
into
an
enemy
country
and
reside
there
after
war
is
avowedly
declared
and
begun
is
undoubtedly
true
vii
but
persons
who
had
gone
to
reside
there
before
the
war
was
begun
seem
by
the
law
of
nations
to
be
included
in
the
number
of
enemies
unless
within
a
reasonable
time
they
chuse
to
withdraw
so
that
the
corcyraeans
when
going
to
besiege
epidamnus
gave
leave
to
all
strangers
to
withdraw
denouncing
that
they
would
otherwise
be
treated
as
enemies
viii
but
the
persons
of
subjects
who
owe
permanent
allegiance
to
a
hostile
power
may
according
to
the
law
of
nations
be
attacked
or
seized
wherever
they
are
found
for
whenever
as
it
was
said
before
war
is
declared
against
any
power
it
is
at
the
same
time
declared
against
all
the
subjects
of
that
power
and
the
law
of
nations
authorises
us
to
attack
an
enemy
in
every
place
an
opinion
supported
by
most
legal
authorities
thus
marcian
says
that
deserters
may
be
killed
in
the
same
manner
as
enemies
wherever
they
are
found
they
may
be
lawfully
killed
there
or
in
their
own
country
in
the
country
in
a
country
belonging
to
no
one
or
on
the
sea
but
as
to
the
unlawfulness
of
killing
or
violently
molesting
them
in
a
neutral
territory
this
protection
does
not
result
from
any
personal
privileges
of
their
own
but
from
the
rights
of
the
sovereign
of
that
country
for
all
civil
societies
had
an
undoubted
right
to
establish
it
as
a
standing
maxim
that
no
violence
should
be
offered
to
any
person
within
their
territories
nor
any
punishment
inflicted
but
by
due
process
of
law
for
where
tribunals
retain
their
authority
in
full
vigour
to
try
the
merits
of
every
offence
and
after
impartial
inquiry
to
acquit
the
innocent
or
condemn
the
guilty
the
power
of
the
sword
must
be
restrained
from
inflicting
promiscuous
death
livy
mentions
the
circumstance
of
seven
carthaginian
gallies
riding
at
anchor
in
a
port
belonging
to
syphax
who
was
then
at
peace
with
the
carthaginians
and
romans
scipio
arrived
at
that
time
with
two
gallies
which
might
have
been
attacked
and
sunk
by
the
carthaginians
before
they
could
enter
the
port
a
brisk
wind
rising
carried
them
in
before
the
carthaginians
could
weigh
anchor
but
out
of
respect
to
the
king
authority
they
durst
not
attack
the
romans
in
his
harbour
ix
but
to
return
to
the
subject
which
is
to
decide
how
far
the
power
of
lawfully
destroying
an
enemy
and
all
that
belong
to
him
extends
an
extent
of
which
we
may
form
some
conception
from
the
very
circumstance
that
even
women
and
children
are
frequently
subject
to
the
calamities
and
disasters
of
war
there
is
no
occasion
to
allege
in
this
place
as
an
example
the
conduct
of
the
hebrews
who
slew
the
women
and
children
of
the
heshbonites
and
who
were
commanded
to
execute
vengeance
upon
the
canaanites
and
upon
all
who
were
involved
in
the
same
guilt
those
examples
where
god
manifestly
interposes
his
commands
are
not
to
be
drawn
into
a
precedent
for
authorising
actions
of
the
same
kind
on
different
occasions
for
the
supreme
and
disposing
power
of
god
can
never
properly
be
compared
with
that
which
men
are
allowed
to
exercise
over
each
other
the
psalmist
expression
of
the
babylonian
children
being
dashed
against
the
stones
is
a
much
stronger
proof
of
the
custom
commonly
prevailing
among
nations
in
the
use
of
victory
to
which
the
language
of
homer
bears
a
close
resemblance
where
the
poet
says
that
in
the
cruel
rage
of
war
even
the
bodies
of
were
dashed
against
the
ground
thucydides
relates
that
when
mycalessus
was
captured
by
the
thracians
they
put
all
even
women
and
children
to
the
sword
arrian
relates
the
same
of
the
macedonians
when
they
took
the
city
of
thebes
and
germanicus
caesar
according
to
the
account
of
tacitus
laid
waste
whole
cantons
of
the
marsians
a
people
of
germany
with
fire
and
sword
to
which
the
historian
adds
without
sparing
either
age
or
sex
the
jewish
women
and
children
too
were
exposed
by
titus
to
be
torn
to
pieces
by
wild
beasts
at
a
public
spectacle
yet
neither
of
those
generals
were
thought
deficient
in
humanity
so
much
had
custom
reconciled
the
minds
of
men
to
this
barbarous
usage
so
that
the
massacre
of
the
aged
like
that
of
priam
by
pyrrhus
is
no
way
surprising
x
the
right
of
putting
prisoners
of
war
to
death
was
so
generally
received
a
maxim
that
the
roman
satirist
has
founded
an
adage
upon
it
and
said
that
when
you
can
sell
a
prisoner
for
a
slave
it
would
be
absurd
to
kill
him
words
which
imply
the
full
power
of
doing
so
if
the
captor
thought
proper
the
commentators
indeed
assign
the
act
of
saving
as
the
derivation
of
the
latin
word
a
slave
thus
thucydides
speaks
of
the
prisoners
taken
at
epidamnus
and
killed
by
the
corcyraeans
and
hannibal
is
reported
to
have
massacred
five
thousand
prisoners
at
once
nor
was
this
power
limited
by
the
law
of
nations
to
any
particular
time
though
it
was
controuled
by
greater
restrictions
in
some
places
than
in
others
xi
besides
many
examples
occur
of
suppliants
being
killed
both
ancient
poets
and
historians
relate
such
actions
as
ordinary
practices
authorised
by
the
laws
of
war
augustin
commends
the
goths
for
sparing
suppliants
who
had
fled
to
churches
for
refuge
and
adds
by
way
of
comment
that
they
deemed
it
unlawful
to
avail
themselves
of
the
power
which
had
usually
been
allowed
by
the
laws
of
war
nor
did
those
who
offered
to
surrender
always
experience
the
lenity
and
mercy
which
they
sought
thereby
tacitus
relates
that
when
the
city
of
uspes
was
invested
the
besieged
sent
a
deputation
with
offers
of
an
immediate
surrender
and
of
no
less
than
ten
thousand
slaves
on
condition
that
the
should
remain
unhurt
the
terms
were
rejected
a
proof
that
such
a
rejection
was
thought
conformable
to
the
rights
of
war
xii
but
even
after
an
unconditional
surrender
we
find
that
those
who
had
capitulated
were
sometimes
put
to
the
sword
in
this
manner
the
princes
of
pometia
were
treated
by
the
romans
the
samnites
by
sylla
the
numidians
and
vercingetorix
by
caesar
it
was
almost
a
standing
practice
with
the
romans
to
crown
their
triumphs
with
the
death
of
an
enemy
generals
whether
made
prisoners
actually
in
the
field
or
by
capitulation
cicero
notices
this
custom
in
his
fifth
speech
against
verres
livy
may
be
consulted
on
this
point
in
many
parts
of
his
history
particularly
in
the
book
and
tacitus
also
in
the
book
of
his
annals
the
latter
writer
in
the
first
book
of
his
history
relates
that
galba
ordered
every
tenth
man
of
those
whom
he
had
upon
their
earnest
supplication
admitted
to
surrender
to
be
beheaded
and
caecina
after
the
capitulation
of
aventicum
punished
julius
alpinus
one
of
the
leading
men
with
death
as
a
chief
promoter
of
the
war
leaving
the
rest
to
the
mercy
or
cruelty
of
vitellius
xiii
historians
sometimes
account
for
this
right
of
putting
enemies
to
death
especially
prisoners
or
suppliants
either
on
the
score
of
retaliation
or
for
obstinate
resistance
these
may
sometimes
be
the
real
but
can
not
be
the
justifiable
motives
of
such
proceedings
for
the
law
of
retaliation
strictly
and
properly
so
called
must
be
directly
enforced
upon
the
person
of
the
delinquent
himself
whereas
in
war
what
is
called
retaliation
frequently
redounds
to
the
ruin
of
those
who
are
no
way
implicated
in
the
blame
the
general
consequences
of
war
are
thus
described
by
diodorus
siculus
they
could
not
be
ignorant
having
learnt
from
experience
that
all
being
involved
in
the
common
fortune
of
war
they
are
liable
on
both
sides
in
defeat
to
suffer
the
same
calamities
which
they
themselves
would
have
inflicted
upon
the
conquered
party
but
as
the
neapolitans
reply
to
belisarius
in
procopius
no
one
can
be
thought
deserving
of
punishment
for
a
resolute
adherence
to
the
side
on
which
he
is
engaged
especially
when
actuated
by
natural
and
just
motives
in
his
choice
of
that
side
so
far
from
incurring
guilt
by
such
a
resolution
it
is
on
the
other
hand
more
criminal
for
any
one
to
desert
his
post
and
so
it
was
judged
by
the
military
laws
of
ancient
rome
livy
says
it
was
a
capital
offence
for
which
no
fear
of
danger
could
be
pleaded
as
an
excuse
so
that
in
the
rigid
application
of
this
right
owing
to
its
importance
every
one
is
left
to
use
his
own
discretion
and
there
may
be
times
and
circumstances
in
which
the
law
of
nations
will
justify
its
full
exertion
xiv
the
same
right
was
exercised
upon
hostages
also
not
only
upon
those
who
had
bound
themselves
as
it
were
by
convention
but
even
upon
those
who
had
been
delivered
up
by
others
two
hundred
and
fifty
hostages
were
once
massacred
by
the
thessalians
and
the
volsci
aurunci
to
the
amount
of
three
hundred
by
the
romans
it
is
to
be
observed
that
children
were
sometimes
given
as
hostages
which
we
find
was
done
by
the
parthians
and
by
simon
who
was
one
of
the
maccabees
and
in
the
times
of
porsena
it
was
usual
to
deliver
women
as
hostages
a
practice
which
as
tacitus
informs
us
was
followed
by
the
germans
xv
as
the
law
of
nations
permits
many
things
in
the
manner
above
explained
which
are
not
permitted
by
the
law
of
nature
so
it
prohibits
some
things
which
the
law
of
nature
allows
thus
spies
if
discovered
and
taken
are
usually
treated
with
the
utmost
severity
yet
there
is
no
doubt
but
the
law
of
nations
allows
any
one
to
send
spies
as
moses
did
to
the
land
of
promise
of
whom
joshua
was
one
persons
of
that
description
may
sometimes
be
lawfully
employed
by
those
who
are
engaged
in
an
evidently
just
war
others
too
who
have
not
such
evident
proofs
of
the
justice
of
their
cause
may
plead
the
rights
of
war
as
a
vindication
for
employing
such
persons
but
if
any
are
to
be
found
who
disdain
to
avail
themselves
of
such
a
privilege
or
opportunity
no
argument
either
for
or
against
the
lawfulness
of
employing
spies
can
be
drawn
from
their
conduct
which
proceeds
rather
from
a
nobleness
of
mind
and
a
confidence
in
open
strength
than
from
any
decided
opinion
upon
the
subject
chapter
on
the
right
to
lay
waste

enemy

and
carry
off
his
effects
an
enemy
property
may
be
wasted
and
plundered

deemed
sacred
how
far
exempted
stratagem
how
far
permitted
cicero
in
the
third
book
of
his
offices
has
said
that
there
is
nothing
repugnant
to
the
law
of
nature
in
spoiling
the
effects
of
an
enemy
whom
by
the
same
law
we
are
authorized
to
kill
wherefore
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
same
things
should
be
allowed
by
the
law
of
nations
polybius
for
this
reason
in
the
fifth
book
of
his
history
maintains
that
the
laws
of
war
authorise
the
destruction
of
an
forts
harbours
and
fleets
the
seizure
of
his
men
or
carrying
off
the
produce
of
his
country
and
every
thing
of
that
description
and
we
find
from
livy
that
there
are
certain
rights
of
war
by
which
an
enemy
must
expect
to
suffer
the
calamities
which
he
is
allowed
to
inflict
such
as
the
burning
of
corn
the
destruction
of
houses
and
the
plunder
of
men
and
cattle
almost
every
page
of
history
abounds
in
examples
of
entire
cities
being
destroyed
walls
levelled
to
the
ground
and
even
whole
countries
wasted
by
fire
and
sword
even
in
cases
of
surrender
towns
have
sometimes
been
destroyed
while
the
inhabitants
were
spared
an
example
of
which
is
given
by
tacitus
in
the
taking
of
artaxata
by
the
romans
the
inhabitants
opened
their
gates
and
were
spared
but
the
town
was
devoted
to
the
flames
ii
nor
does
the
law
of
nations
in
itself
considered
apart
from
other
duties
which
will
be
mentioned
hereafter
make
any
exemption
in
favour
of
things
deemed
sacred
for
when
places
are
taken
by
an
enemy
all
things
without
exception
whether
sacred
or
not
must
fall
a
sacrifice
for
which
it
is
assigned
as
a
reason
that
things
which
are
called
sacred
are
not
actually
excepted
from
all
human
uses
but
are
a
kind
of
public
property
called
sacred
indeed
from
the
general
purposes
to
which
they
are
more
immediately
devoted
and
as
a
proof
of
this
it
is
usual
when
one
nation
surrenders
to
another
state
or
sovereign
to
surrender
along
with
other
rights
every
thing
of
a
sacred
kind
as
appears
by
the
form
cited
from
livy
in
a
former
part
of
this
treatise
and
therefore
ulpian
says
that
the
public
have
a
property
in
sacred
things
conformably
to
which
tacitus
says
that
in
the
italian
towns
all
the
temples
the
images
of
the
gods
and
every
thing
connected
with
religion
belonged
of
right
to
the
roman
people
for
this
reason
a
nation
as
the
lawyers
paulus
and
venuleius
openly
maintain
may
under
a
change
of
circumstances
convert
to
secular
uses
things
that
have
before
been
consecrated
and
an
overruling
necessity
may
justify
the
hand
which
has
formerly
consecrated
the
object
in
employing
it
as
one
of
the
resources
and
instruments
of
war
a
thing
which
pericles
once
did
under
a
pledge
of
making
restitution
mago
did
the
same
in
spain
and
the
romans
in
the
mithridatic
war
we
read
of
the
same
actions
done
by
sylla
pompey
caesar
and
others
plutarch
in
his
life
of
tiberius
gracchus
says
that
nothing
is
so
sacred
and
inviolable
as
divine
offerings
yet
no
one
can
hinder
these
from
being
removed
or
applied
to
other
purposes
at
the
pleasure
of
the
state
thus
livy
mentions
the
ornaments
of
the
temples
which
marcellus
brought
from
syracuse
to
rome
as
acquisitions
made
by
the
right
of
war
iii
what
has
been
said
of
sacred
things
and
edifices
applies
also
to
another
kind
of
solemn
fabrics
and
those
are
sepulchral
structures
which
may
be
considered
not
merely
as
repositories
of
the
dead
but
as
monuments
belonging
to
the
living
whether
families
or
states
for
this
reason
pomponius
has
said
that
these
like
all
other
sacred
places
when
taken
by
an
enemy
may
lose
their
inviolability
and
paulus
is
of
the
same
opinion
observing
that
we
are
not
restrained
by
any
religious
scruple
from
using
the
sepulchres
of
an
enemy
for
the
stones
taken
from
thence
may
be
applied
to
any
other
purpose
but
this
right
does
not
authorise
wanton
insult
offered
to
the
ashes
of
the
dead
for
that
would
be
a
violation
of
the
solemn
rights
of
burial
which
as
it
was
shewn
in
a
preceding
part
of
this
work
were
introduced
and
established
by
the
law
of
nations
iv
here
it
may
be
briefly
observed
that
according
to
the
law
of
nations
any
thing
belonging
to
an
enemy
may
be
taken
not
only
by
open
force
but
by
stratagem

it
be
unaccompanied

treachery

whether

of
either
of
the

can

the
rights
of

in
what
manner
this

peculiarly
applies
to
solemn
wars
i
besides
the
impunity
allowed
to
men
for
certain
actions
which
have
been
mentioned
before
there
are
other
consequences
and
effects
peculiar
to
the
law
of
nations
attending
solemn
and
formal
war
the
law
of
nature
indeed
authorises
our
making
such
acquisitions
in
a
just
war
as
may
be
deemed
an
equivalent
for
a
debt
which
can
not
otherwise
be
obtained
or
as
may
inflict
a
loss
upon
the
aggressor
provided
it
be
within
the
bounds
of
reasonable
punishment
according
to
this
right
as
we
find
in
the
fourteenth
chapter
of
genesis
abraham
devoted
to
god
a
tenth
part
of
the
spoils
which
he
had
taken
from
the
five
kings
and
the
inspired
writer
in
the
seventh
chapter
of
his
epistle
to
the
hebrews
gives
the
same
interpretation
of
this
passage
in
the
same
manner
the
greeks
too
the
carthaginians
and
the
romans
devoted
a
tenth
portion
of
the
spoils
of
war
to
their
deities
jacob
in
making
a
particular
bequest
to
joseph
above
his
brethren
says
i
have
given
to
thee
one
portion
above
thy
brethren
which
i
took
out
of
the
hand
of
the
amorite
with
my
sword
and
with
my
bow
in
this
place
the
expression
i
took
is
used
according
to
the
prophetic
style
where
an
event
that
will
for
certain
take
place
is
spoken
of
in
the
past
time
and
an
action
is
here
attributed
to
jacob
which
some
of
his
descendants
were
to
perform
supposing
the
progenitor
and
his
children
to
be
the
same
person
nor
is
it
upon
conjecture
alone
that
such
a
right
is
founded
but
the
divine
law
giver
himself
pronounces
sentence
against
a
city
that
has
rejected
the
offers
of
peace
and
afterwards
been
taken
by
storm
that
he
gives
all
her
spoils
to
the
conqueror
ii
but
according
to
the
law
of
nations
not
only
the
person
who
makes
war
upon
just
grounds
but
any
one
whatever
engaged
in
regular
and
formal
war
becomes
absolute
proprietor
of
every
thing
which
he
takes
from
the
enemy
so
that
all
nations
respect
his
title
and
the
title
of
all
who
derive
through
him
their
claim
to
such
possessions
which
as
to
all
foreign
relations
constitutes
the
true
idea
of
dominion
for
as
cyrus
in
xenophon
observes
when
the
city
of
an
enemy
is
taken
every
thing
that
is
taken
therein
becomes
a
lawful
prize
to
the
conquerors
and
plato
in
his
treatise
on
laws
asserts
the
same
cicero
in
his
speech
against
rullus
says
that
mitylene
belonged
to
the
roman
people
by
the
laws
of
war
and
the
right
of
conquest
and
in
the
first
book
of
his
offices
he
observes
that
some
things
become
the
private
property
of
those
who
take
possession
of
them
when
unoccupied
or
of
those
who
make
a
conquest
of
them
in
theophilus
in
his
greek
institutes
calls
the
one
the
natural
mode
of
acquisition
and
aristotle
denominates
the
other
the
natural
way
of
acquisition
by
the
sword
without
regarding
any
other
reason
but
the
bare
fact
from
which
the
right
arises
thus
nerva
the
son
as
paulus
the
lawyer
relates
said
that
property
arose
from
natural
possession
some
traces
of
which
still
remain
respecting
wild
animals
taken
either
upon
the
sea
or
upon
the
land
or
birds
flying
in
the
air
it
is
seen
also
in
things
taken
in
war
all
which
immediately
become
the
property
of
the
first
captors
now
things
are
considered
as
taken
from
an
enemy
when
taken
from
his
subjects
thus
dercyllides
argues
in
xenophon
that
as
pharnabazus
was
an
enemy
to
the
lacedaemonians
every
thing
belonging
to
mania
who
was
his
subject
might
be
seized
by
the
laws
of
war
iii
but
in
this
question
upon
the
rights
of
war
nations
have
decided
that
a
person
is
understood
to
have
made
a
capture
when
he
detains
a
thing
in
such
a
manner
that
the
owner
has
abandoned
all
probable
hopes
of
recovering
it
or
as
pomponius
speaking
on
the
same
subject
says
when
a
thing
has
escaped
beyond
pursuit
this
takes
place
with
respect
to
moveable
things
in
such
a
manner
that
they
are
said
to
be
taken
when
they
are
carried
within
the
territories
of
the
enemy
or
places
belonging
to
him
for
a
thing
is
lost
in
the
same
manner
as
it
is
recovered
by
postliminium
it
is
said
to
be
recovered
whenever
it
returns
within
the
territories
of
its
owner
sovereign
that
is
into
places
of
which
he
is
master
paulus
indeed
has
expressly
said
that
a
power
or
state
has
lost
a
subject
when
he
has
gone
or
been
carried
out
of
the
territories
of
that
power
and
pomponius
defines
a
prisoner
of
war
to
be
an
enemy
whom
the
troops
of
some
other
belligerent
power
have
taken
and
carried
into
one
of
their
own
places
for
before
he
is
carried
into
those
places
he
continues
still
a
subject
of
the
enemy
the
law
of
nations
in
these
respects
treated
persons
and
things
in
the
same
manner
from
whence
it
is
easy
to
understand
what
is
meant
when
in
another
place
it
is
said
that
things
taken
from
an
enemy
immediately
become
the
lawful
prize
of
the
captors
but
only
upon
the
condition
of
those
things
continuing
in
their
possession
for
a
reasonable
and
certain
time
consequently
it
is
plain
that
ships
and
other
things
taken
at
sea
can
not
be
considered
as
really
the
property
of
the
captors
till
they
have
been
carried
into
some
of
their
ports
or
to
some
place
where
their
whole
fleet
is
stationed
for
in
that
case
all
hope
of
recovery
seems
to
have
vanished
by
a
late
regulation
among
the
european
powers
it
has
been
made
an
established
maxim
of
the
law
of
nations
that
captures
shall
be
deemed
good
and
lawful
which
have
continued
in
the
enemy
possession
for
the
space
of
hours
iv
lands
are
not
understood
to
become
a
lawful
possession
and
absolute
conquest
from
the
moment
they
are
invaded
for
although
it
is
true
that
an
army
takes
immediate
and
violent
possession
of
the
country
which
it
has
invaded
yet
that
can
only
be
considered
as
a
temporary
possession
unaccompanied
with
any
of
the
rights
and
consequences
alluded
to
in
this
work
till
it
has
been
ratified
and
secured
by
some
durable
means
by
cession
or
treaty
for
this
reason
the
land
without
the
gates
of
rome
where
hannibal
encamped
was
so
far
from
being
judged
entirely
lost
that
it
was
sold
for
the
same
price
that
it
would
have
been
sold
for
before
that
period
now
land
will
be
considered
as
completely
conquered
when
it
is
inclosed
or
secured
by
permanent
fortifications
so
that
no
other
state
or
sovereign
can
have
free
access
to
it
without
first
making
themselves
masters
of
those
fortifications
on
this
account
flaccus
the
sicilian
assigns
no
improbable
conjecture
for
the
origin
of
the
word
territory
because
the
enemy
is
deterred
from
entering
it
at
least
there
is
as
much
probability
in
this
conjecture
as
in
that
of
varro
who
derives
it
from
the
word
treading
the
soil
frontinus
deduces
it
from
the
earth
and
pomponius
from
the
terror
of
judicial
authority
exercised
in
each
country
xenophon
however
in
his
book
on
tributes
seems
to
accord
with
the
first
of
these
opinions
for
he
says
that
in
time
of
war
the
possession
of
a
country
is
kept
by
walls
strong
holds
and
barriers
it
is
a
clear
point
too
that
for
any
thing
to
become
a
prize
or
conquest
by
the
right
of
war
it
must
belong
to
an
enemy
for
things
within
an
enemy
territory
for
instance
in
any
of
his
towns
or
garrisons
can
not
be
acquired
as
property
by
the
laws
of
war
if
the
owners
of
those
things
are
neither
subjects
nor
confederates
of
the
enemy
it
is
observed
in
one
of
the
speeches
of
aeschines
that
philip
though
at
war
with
the
amphipolitans
could
not
lawfully
take
possession
of
amphipolis
as
a
conquest
it
being
a
city
which
belonged
to
the
athenians
for
as
the
enemy
is
likely
to
derive
no
assistance
in
the
war
from
things
which
neither
belong
to
himself
nor
to
a
confederate
no
just
reason
can
be
assigned
for
taking
them
and
the
right
of
making
things
change
their
owners
by
force
is
of
too
odious
a
nature
to
admit
of
any
extension
vi
the
observation
usually
made
that
all
things
on
board
an
ships
are
to
be
deemed
an
enemy
goods
ought
not
to
be
received
as
a
standing
and
acknowledged
rule
of
the
law
of
nations
but
only
as
a
maxim
indicating
the
strong
presumption
that
both
goods
and
vessel
belong
to
the
same
owner
unless
clear
proof
to
the
contrary
can
be
brought
the
states
general
of
holland
made
such
a
decision
in
the
year
at
a
time
when
the
war
with
the
raged
with
the
greatest
violence
and
the
decision
consequently
passed
into
a
law
vii
according
to
the
law
of
nations
it
is
undoubtedly
true
that
things
taken
from
an
enemy
which
had
been
captured
by
him
can
not
be
claimed
by
those
to
whom
they
belonged
before
they
were
in
the
possession
and
who
had
lost
them
in
war
because
the
law
of
nations
assigned
them
to
the
enemy
by
the
first
capture
and
then
to
the
person
who
took
them
from
him
by
the
second
upon
this
principle
among
others
jephthah
defends
himself
against
the
ammonites
because
by
the
laws
of
war
they
had
lost
the
land
which
they
claimed
in
the
same
manner
as
another
part
had
been
transferred
from
the
moabites
to
the
amorites
and
from
the
amorites
to
the
hebrews
thus
david
too
claims
and
divides
as
his
own
what
he
himself
had
taken
from
the
amalekites
and
the
amalekites
before
him
from
the
philistines
titus
largius
as
we
are
informed
by
dionysius
of
halicarnassus
when
the
volscians
laid
claim
to
some
possessions
which
they
had
formerly
held
delivered
it
as
his
opinion
in
the
roman
senate
that
the
romans
were
the
fair
and
just
owners
of
what
they
had
gained
by
the
right
of
conquest
nor
ought
they
to
be
so
weak
as
to
abandon
the
fruits
of
their
valour
for
not
only
the
people
of
that
day
but
their
posterity
also
had
a
right
to
a
share
of
those
possessions
so
that
to
abandon
them
would
be
treating
themselves
like
enemies
viii
and
ix
one
great
point
which
the
law
of
nations
designed
to
establish
was
that
the
effects
or
possessions
of
one
enemy
should
be
considered
by
another
as
things
having
no
owner
things
belonging
to
no
one
became
the
property
of
those
who
find
or
take
them
both
of
those
who
like
sovereign
powers
employ
others
in
such
service
and
of
those
who
take
them
with
their
own
hands
thus
not
only
slaves
or
the
immediate
members
of
a
man
household
but
all
who
engage
themselves
any
way
in
the
service
of
others
may
be
said
to
acquire
for
their
employers
all
the
property
which
they
take
or
gain
even
in
those
things
which
apparently
lie
in
common
to
all
men
such
as
pearls
fish
or
fowl
modestinus
has
justly
said
that
whatever
is
naturally
gained
like
a
possession
we
may
acquire
through
the
means
of
any
one
we
chuse
to
employ
and
upon
the
same
principle
paulus
observes
that
in
every
acquisition
the
exertion
of
mind
and
body
must
concur
the
former
purely
our
own
and
the
latter
either
our
own
or
that
of
another
in
the
same
manner
possession
may
be
taken
for
us
by
an
attorney
guardian
or
trustee
provided
they
do
it
on
our
account
and
in
our
name
the
reason
of
which
is
because
one
man
may
naturally
be
the
voluntary
instrument
of
another
with
the
consent
of
that
other
so
that
the
distinction
made
between
persons
in
a
servile
and
free
condition
as
to
the
acquisition
of
property
is
a
distinction
only
of
the
civil
law
and
applicable
to
its
rules
of
transferring
acquiring
and
confirming
property
and
yet
the
emperor
severus
afterwards
applied
these
rules
to
the
natural
acquisition
of
things
not
only
from
motives
of
utility
but
as
he
avowed
himself
from
motives
of
equity
and
justice
so
that
apart
from
all
authority
of
the
civil
law
it
is
an
established
maxim
that
what
any
one
can
do
for
himself
he
can
do
through
means
of
another
and
doing
such
acts
by
another
is
the
same
as
doing
them
himself
x
a
distinction
must
be
made
between
actions
in
war
that
are
really
of
a
public
nature
and
the
acts
of
individuals
occasioned
by
public
war
by
the
latter
individuals
acquire
an
absolute
and
direct
property
in
the
things
which
they
take
and
by
the
former
the
state
makes
those
acquisitions
upon
this
principle
of
the
law
of
nations
scipio
treated
with
masinissa
stating
that
as
it
was
under
the
auspices
of
the
roman
people
that
syphax
was
conquered
and
taken
prisoner
himself
his
wife
his
kingdom
his
territory
his
towns
and
subjects
inhabiting
those
towns
in
short
every
thing
belonging
to
him
became
a
lawful
prize
to
the
roman
people
in
the
same
manner
antiochus
the
great
maintained
that
belonged
to
seleucus
and
not
to
ptolemy
because
seleucus
had
been
the
principal
in
the
war
to
which
ptolemy
had
contributed
his
assistance
in
the
fifth
book
of
polybius
there
is
an
account
of
the
matter
xi
things
immoveable
are
generally
taken
by
some
public
act
such
as
marching
an
army
into
the
country
or
placing
garrisons
there
so
that
as
pomponius
has
said
lands
taken
from
the
enemy
become
the
property
of
the
state
and
form
no
part
of
the
booty
belonging
to
the
individual
captors
thus
among
the
hebrews
and
lacedaemonians
lands
that
were
made
a
conquest
were
divided
by
lot
the
romans
too
either
retained
conquered
lands
to
let
them
out
for
rent
sometimes
leaving
a
small
portion
to
the
ancient
possessor
or
divided
them
among
colonists
whom
they
sent
out
or
made
them
tributary
innumerable
instances
of
which
we
meet
with
in
their
histories
their
laws
and
treaties
on
the
admeasurements
of
lands
xii
but
things
moveable
whether
inanimate
or
living
are
taken
either
as
connected
or
unconnected
with
the
public
service
when
unconnected
with
the
public
service
they
become
the
property
of
the
individual
captors
reference
may
here
be
made
to
the
remark
of
celsus
that
goods
found
among
us
do
not
belong
to
the
state
but
to
the
prior
occupant
by
which
are
meant
things
found
among
us
at
the
breaking
out
of
a
war
for
the
same
was
observed
of
persons
when
under
the
same
circumstances
they
were
considered
as
goods
taken
on
this
subject
there
is
a
remarkable
passage
in
tryphoninus
those
persons
who
have
gone
into
a
foreign
country
in
time
of
peace
upon
the
sudden
breaking
out
of
war
are
made
slaves
by
those
among
whom
it
is
their
misfortune
to
be
found
being
considered
as
enemies
xiii
what
has
been
said
upon
the
law
of
nations
allowing
individuals
to
acquire
property
by
taking
it
from
an
enemy
must
be
understood
as
meaning
the
law
of
nations
prior
to
the
regulations
of
civil
laws
upon
that
point
for
the
capture
of
an
enemy
goods
which
at
first
appear
to
resemble
things
in
common
which
any
one
may
seize
is
now
like
that
of
wild
birds
or
beasts
subject
to
limitation
by
the
laws
of
every
state
being
in
some
cases
assigned
to
the
sovereign
and
in
others
belonging
to
the
captors
it
may
in
some
countries
indeed
be
introduced
as
a
rule
of
law
for
the
whole
of
an
enemy
goods
found
there
to
be
confiscated
xiv
the
case
is
very
different
respecting
what
any
one
takes
in
actual
engagements
for
there
every
individual
bears
the
character
of
his
country
acting
in
her
stead
and
supporting
her
rights
through
the
exertions
of
those
individuals
the
state
acquires
both
property
and
dominion
with
a
power
according
to
the
principles
of
civilized
countries
of
conferring
them
on
whom
she
pleases
this
is
not
a
practice
of
modern
date
but
one
prevailing
among
the
most
free
and
independent
nations
of
remote
antiquity
the
poets
and
historians
of
those
days
describe
the
hero
after
the
heat
the
burden
and
dangers
of
the
day
carrying
his
spoils
to
the
common
stock
to
be
divided
by
the
general
among
the
army
after
retaining
his
proper
share
to
himself
xxiii
it
is
observed
by
legal
authorities
to
be
a
custom
which
has
silently
gained
ground
for
either
allies
or
subjects
who
engage
in
war
without
pay
and
at
their
own
risque
and
expence
to
be
rewarded
with
the
captures
that
they
make
the
reason
why
allies
have
such
a
privilege
is
evident
because
one
ally
is
naturally
bound
to
another
to
repair
the
losses
which
he
has
sustained
by
entering
into
a
mutual
agreement
to
support
a
common
cause
besides
it
seldom
happens
that
services
are
given
without
some
consideration
in
return
quintilian
applying
the
same
reasoning
to
another
case
alleges
that
it
is
but
just
for
orators
and
advocates
who
devote
their
whole
time
and
talents
to
the
business
of
others
to
be
requited
for
their
services
as
thereby
they
preclude
themselves
from
acquiring
gain
in
any
other
way
it
is
most
likely
therefore
that
some
advantage
gained
from
the
enemy
is
always
expected
as
a
compensation
for
the
loss
and
risque
incurred
unless
there
is
evidence
to
the
contrary
from
some
antecedent
treaty
in
which
there
is
an
express
stipulation
for
gratuitous
assistance
and
services
xxiv
such
claim
to
a
share
of
the
spoils
is
not
equally
evident
where
subjects
only
are
concerned
for
the
state
has
a
right
to
their
services
still
where
all
are
not
engaged
in
arms
but
only
some
those
who
give
up
their
time
to
the
calling
of
soldiers
and
expose
their
lives
to
its
hazards
have
a
right
to
be
rewarded
and
supported
by
the
body
politic
and
as
a
compensation
for
this
loss
of
time
and
this
personal
danger
it
is
but
reasonable
they
should
have
a
share
of
the
spoils
with
respect
to
allies
there
is
an
example
in
the
roman
treaty
in
which
the
latins
are
admitted
to
an
equal
share
of
the
spoil
in
those
wars
which
were
carried
on
under
the
auspices
of
the
roman
people
thus
in
the
war
which
the
aetolians
carried
on
with
the
assistance
of
the
romans
the
lands
and
cities
were
ceded
to
the
aetolians
and
the
prisoners
and
moveable
effects
were
given
to
the
romans
after
the
defeat
of
king
ptolemy
demetrius
gave
part
of
the
spoils
to
the
athenians
ambrose
in
speaking
of
the
expedition
of
abraham
shews
the
equity
of
this
practice
he
asserts
that
it
was
but
just
for
those
who
had
assisted
him
as
partners
in
the
danger
to
share
in
the
prizes
which
were
their
due
reward
as
to
what
were
the
privileges
of
subjects
in
these
respects
we
have
a
proof
in
the
conduct
of
the
hebrews
among
whom
it
was
usual
for
half
of
the
spoils
to
be
given
to
those
who
were
engaged
in
battle
in
the
same
manner
the
soldiers
of
alexander
were
allowed
to
appropriate
to
themselves
whatever
they
took
from
individuals
except
that
it
was
usual
for
a
considerable
portion
to
be
set
apart
for
the
king
so
that
it
was
made
a
subject
of
accusation
against
those
at
arbela
who
were
said
to
have
entered
into
a
conspiracy
for
securing
to
themselves
every
thing
that
was
taken
without
contributing
a
due
proportion
of
it
to
the
treasury
but
individuals
were
not
allowed
in
the
same
manner
to
appropriate
to
themselves
the
public
property
of
an
enemy
that
is
such
as
belonged
to
the
state
thus
when
the
macedonians
made
themselves
masters
of
the
camp
of
darius
at
the
river
piramus
and
every
thing
was
given
up
to
plunder
they
spared
the
royal
pavilion
in
conformity
to
an
ancient
custom
according
to
which
curtius
it
was
always
reserved
as
the
properest
place
in
which
the
victorious
prince
could
be
received
there
was
a
custom
somewhat
like
this
among
the
hebrews
who
always
placed
the
crown
of
the
vanquished
king
upon
the
head
of
the
conqueror
and
assigned
to
him
every
thing
that
was
taken
belonging
to
the
royal
household
we
read
of
the
same
conduct
in
charles
the
great
who
upon
conquering
the
hungarians
gave
up
the
private
property
as
plunder
to
the
soldiers
reserving
for
the
royal
use
all
the
public
treasures
some
things
indeed
are
too
inconsiderable
to
be
made
public
property
it
is
a
generally
received
maxim
for
such
things
to
belong
to
the
individual
captors
this
was
the
practice
in
the
ancient
times
of
the
roman
republic
a
privilege
not
unlike
this
is
sometimes
given
to
seamen
who
serve
for
pay
it
is
what
the
french
call
spoils
or
pillage
including
all
wearing
apparel
and
all
gold
and
silver
under
the
value
of
ten
crowns
on
this
point
different
customs
prevail
in
different
countries
in
spain
sometimes
a
fifth
and
sometimes
a
third
was
allowed
to
the
soldiers
and
at
others
half
was
reserved
for
the
crown
on
some
occasions
a
seventh
or
tenth
part
was
allowed
to
the
general
and
the
rest
belonged
to
the
captors
except
ships
of
war
which
belong
entirely
to
the
sometimes
a
division
was
made
in
proportion
to
the
hazard
and
expence
which
was
the
case
among
the
italians
where
the
third
part
of
the
prize
was
assigned
to
the
owner
of
the
victorious
vessel
another
third
to
those
who
had
merchandise
on
board
and
the
remaining
third
to
the
combatants
in
some
cases
it
happens
that
private
adventurers
are
not
allowed
the
whole
of
their
captures
a
certain
portion
of
which
must
go
to
the
state
or
to
those
who
have
received
a
grant
of
such
prizes
from
the
state
thus
in
spain
if
in
time
of
war
ships
are
fitted
out
by
private
persons
one
part
of
the
captures
which
they
make
belongs
to
the
crown
and
another
to
the
lord
high
admiral
so
likewise
in
france
and
holland
the
tenth
part
of
a
prize
belonged
to
the
admiral
a
fifth
also
being
previously
deducted
for
the
use
of
the
state
but
by
land
it
is
customary
upon
the
taking
of
towns
and
in
battles
for
every
one
to
keep
the
prizes
which
he
takes
but
in
excursions
every
thing
taken
becomes
the
common
stock
of
all
engaged
being
afterwards
divided
amongst
them
according
to
their
respective
ranks
xxv
as
a
consequence
deducible
from
the
above
positions
it
may
be
observed
that
if
a
people
not
engaged
in
war
be
made
mediators
in
a
doubtful
matter
respecting
things
captured
in
war
the
cause
must
be
adjudged
in
favour
of
him
who
has
on
his
side
the
laws
and
customs
of
the
country
which
he
has
espoused
but
if
no
such
right
can
be
proved
the
prize
must
be
adjudged
to
the
state
rather
than
to
the
individual
the
maxim
indeed
of
quintilian
can
never
be
admitted
that
the
laws
of
war
can
never
be
enforced
in
matters
that
may
be
decided
by
judicial
authority
and
that
on
the
other
hand
whatever
has
been
gained
by
arms
can
be
maintained
by
force
of
arms
alone
xxvi
it
was
observed
in
a
former
part
of
this
chapter
that
things
not
belonging
to
an
enemy
can
not
be
taken
although
found
with
him
for
this
is
neither
consonant
to
natural
justice
nor
introduced
by
the
law
of
nations
but
if
in
those
things
the
enemy
had
any
right
connected
with
possession
such
as
the
right
of
pledge
retention
or
service
that
would
not
obstruct
the
power
of
the
captors
it
is
a
disputed
point
both
as
to
persons
and
things
whether
they
can
be
lawfully
taken
in
the
territory
of
a
power
at
war
with
neither
of
the
belligerents
in
regard
only
to
the
law
of
nations
as
far
as
it
allows
us
to
kill
an
enemy
wherever
he
is
found
the
place
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
question
but
considering
the
rights
of
the
sovereign
to
whom
that
territory
belongs
he
undoubtedly
has
a
right
to
forbid
the
seizure
of
persons
or
the
capture
of
things
within
his
own
dominions
and
may
demand
satisfaction
for
the
violation
of
that
right
in
the
same
manner
though
beasts
that
are
wild
by
nature
become
the
property
of
those
who
take
them
still
an
owner
may
forbid
any
one
to
commit
a
trespass
upon
his
lands
in
order
to
take
them
chapter
vii
on
the
right
over
prisoners
of
war
by
the
law
of
nations
slavery
the
result
of
being
taken
in
solemn
war
the
same
condition
extends
to
the
descendants
of
those
taken
the
power
over
them
even
incorporeal
things
may
be
gained
by
the
rights
of
war
reason
of
this
this
right
not
prevalent
to
the
same
extent
among
christian
powers
of
the
present
day
the
substitute
used
in
place
of
this
right
i
by
the
law
of
nature
in
its
primaeval
state
apart
from
human
institutions
and
customs
no
men
can
be
slaves
and
it
is
in
this
sense
that
legal
writers
maintain
the
opinion
that
slavery
is
repugnant
to
nature
yet
in
a
former
part
of
this
treatise
it
was
shewn
that
there
is
nothing
repugnant
to
natural
justice
in
deriving
the
origin
of
servitude
from
human
actions
whether
founded
upon
compact
or
crime
but
the
law
of
nations
now
under
consideration
is
of
wider
extent
both
in
its
authority
over
persons
and
its
effects
for
as
to
persons
not
only
those
who
surrender
their
rights
or
engage
themselves
to
servitude
are
considered
in
the
light
of
slaves
but
all
who
are
taken
prisoners
in
public
and
solemn
war
come
under
the
same
description
from
the
time
that
they
are
carried
into
the
places
of
which
the
enemy
is
master
nor
is
the
commission
of
crime
requisite
to
reduce
them
to
this
condition
but
the
fate
of
all
is
alike
who
are
unfortunately
taken
within
the
territories
of
an
enemy
upon
the
breaking
out
of
war
ii
and
iii
in
ancient
times
while
slavery
was
permitted
to
exist
the
offspring
born
during
captivity
or
servitude
continued
in
the
same
condition
as
the
the
consequences
of
such
rules
were
of
wide
extent
there
was
no
cruelty
which
masters
might
not
inflict
upon
their
slaves
there
was
no
service
the
performance
of
which
they
might
not
compel
the
power
even
of
life
and
death
was
in
their
hands
however
the
roman
laws
at
length
set
bounds
to
such
wanton
power
at
least
to
the
exercise
of
it
within
the
roman
territories
every
thing
too
found
upon
the
prisoner
person
became
a
lawful
prize
to
the
captor
for
as
justinian
observes
one
who
was
entirely
in
the
power
of
another
could
have
no
property
of
his
own
iv
and
incorporeal
rights
gained
by
the
enemy
along
with
the
person
so
captured
can
not
be
considered
in
the
light
of
primary
and
original
acquisitions
and
there
are
some
rights
so
purely
personal
in
their
nature
that
they
can
not
be
lost
even
by
captivity
nor
the
duties
attached
thereto
ever
be
relinquished
of
such
a
nature
was
the
paternal
right
among
the
romans
for
rights
of
this
kind
can
not
exist
but
immediately
with
the
person
to
whom
they
originally
belonged
all
these
rights
to
prizes
which
were
introduced
by
the
law
of
nations
were
intended
as
an
inducement
to
captors
to
refrain
from
the
cruel
rigour
of
putting
prisoners
to
death
as
they
might
hope
to
derive
some
advantage
from
sparing
and
saving
them
from
hence
pomponius
deduces
the
origin
of
the
word
servus
or
slave
being
one
who
might
have
been
put
to
death
but
from
motives
of
interest
or
humanity
had
been
saved
vi
being
the
ix
of
the
original
it
has
long
been
a
maxim
universally
received
among
the
powers
of
christendom
that
prisoners
of
war
can
not
be
made
slaves
so
as
to
be
sold
or
compelled
to
the
hardships
and
labour
attached
to
slavery
and
they
have
with
good
reason
embraced
the
latter
principle
as
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
every
precept
of
the
law
of
charity
for
men
to
refuse
abandoning
a
cruel
right
unless
they
might
be
allowed
to
substitute
another
of
great
though
somewhat
inferior
rigour
in
its
place
and
this
as
gregoras
informs
us
became
a
traditionary
principle
among
all
who
professed
one
common
religion
nor
was
it
confined
to
those
who
lived
under
the
authority
of
the
roman
empire
but
prevailed
among
the
thessalians
the
illyrians
the
triballians
and
though
such
an
abolition
of
slavery
and
mitigation
of
captivity
may
be
considered
as
of
trivial
import
yet
they
were
effects
produced
by
the
introduction
of
the
christian
religion
especially
upon
recollection
that
socrates
tried
but
without
effect
to
prevail
upon
the
greeks
to
forbear
making
slaves
of
each
other
in
this
respect
the
mahometans
act
towards
each
other
in
the
same
manner
as
christians
do
though
it
is
still
the
practice
among
christian
powers
to
detain
prisoners
of
war
till
their
ransom
be
paid
the
amount
of
which
depends
upon
the
will
of
the
conqueror
unless
it
has
been
settled
by
express
treaty
the
right
of
detaining
such
prisoners
has
sometimes
been
allowed
to
the
individuals
who
took
them
except
where
the
prisoners
were
personages
of
extraordinary
rank
who
were
always
considered
as
prisoners
of
war
to
the
state

incorporeal

thessalian
bond
considered
i
if
individuals
can
reduce
each
other
to
subjection
it
is
not
surprising
that
states
can
do
the
same
and
by
this
means
acquire
a
civil
absolute
or
mixed
dominion
so
that
in
the
language
of
tertullian
victory
has
often
been
the
foundation
of
dominion
and
it
often
happens
as
quintilian
remarks
that
the
boundaries
of
states
and
kingdoms
of
nations
and
cities
can
only
be
settled
by
the
laws
of
war
quintus
curtius
relates
of
alexander
that
he
said
it
was
for
conquerors
to
dictate
laws
which
the
conquered
were
bound
to
receive
this
has
always
been
a
general
opinion
and
rule
thus
ariovistus
in
caesar
laid
it
down
as
an
indubitable
right
of
war
for
the
conqueror
to
impose
whatever
terms
he
pleased
upon
the
conquered
nor
did
he
suppose
the
roman
people
would
allow
any
one
to
interpose
with
them
in
the
discretionary
use
of
this
right
by
conquest
a
prince
succeeds
to
all
the
rights
of
the
conquered
sovereign
or
state
and
if
it
be
a
commonwealth
he
acquires
all
the
rights
and
privileges
which
the
people
possessed
he
gains
the
same
right
which
the
state
had
before
to
alienate
the
possessions
or
to
transmit
them
if
he
chuses
to
his
descendants
by
which
means
they
will
become
a
patrimonial
territory
ii
the
right
of
conquest
may
go
even
beyond
this
a
state
may
hereby
lose
its
political
existence
so
far
as
to
form
an
appendage
to
another
power
which
was
the
case
with
the
roman
provinces
or
if
a
king
engaged
in
war
against
a
state
at
his
own
expence
has
reduced
it
to
complete
subjection
his
authority
over
it
becomes
an
absolute
rather
than
a
limited
sovereignty
it
can
no
longer
be
called
an
independent
state
but
by
the
right
of
conquest
forms
an
integral
part
of
the
prince
immediate
dominions
xenophon
in
drawing
the
character
of
agesilaus
commends
him
for
requiring
no
other
services
and
obedience
of
the
cities
he
had
conquered
than
what
is
usually
paid
by
subjects
to
their
lawful
sovereigns
iii
from
hence
it
will
be
easy
to
understand
what
is
meant
by
a
mixed
government
composed
partly
of
civil
and
partly
of
absolute
power
it
is
a
government
where
subjection
is
united
with
some
degree
of
personal
liberty
we
sometimes
read
of
nations
that
have
been
so
far
subdued
as
to
be
deprived
of
the
use
of
all
warlike
arms
being
allowed
to
retain
no
instruments
of
iron
but
the
implements
of
husbandry
and
of
others
that
have
been
compelled
to
change
their
national
customs
and
language
iv
states
as
well
as
individuals
may
lose
their
property
by
the
laws
of
war
and
even
a
voluntary
surrender
is
in
reality
nothing
more
than
giving
up
what
might
have
been
taken
by
force
for
as
livy
says
where
all
things
submit
to
the
power
of
arms
the
conqueror
may
impose
whatever
terms
and
exact
whatever
fines
he
pleases
thus
the
roman
people
by
the
victories
of
pompey
acquired
all
the
territories
which
mithridates
had
gained
by
conquest
the
incorporeal
rights
too
belonging
to
one
state
may
pass
to
another
by
the
rights
of
conquest
upon
the
taking
of
alba
the
romans
retained
all
the
rights
belonging
to
that
city
from
hence
it
follows
that
the
thessalians
were
released
from
the
obligation
of
paying
a
sum
of
money
which
they
owed
to
the
thebans
alexander
upon
the
taking
of
thebes
having
as
a
conqueror
forgiven
the
debt
nor
is
the
argument
used
by
quintilian
in
favour
of
the
thebans
at
all
convincing
he
maintains
that
nothing
but
what
is
of
a
tangible
nature
can
pass
by
right
of
conquest
a
class
of
things
to
which
incorporeal
rights
can
never
be
reduced
and
that
there
is
a
material
difference
between
inheritance
and
victory
the
former
of
which
may
convey
incorporeal
rights
but
the
latter
can
give
nothing
except
things
of
a
solid
and
visible
substance
but
on
the
other
hand
it
may
be
justly
said
that
whoever
is
master
of
the
persons
is
master
also
of
all
the
rights
and
things
which
are
vested
in
those
persons
who
are
in
that
case
considered
as
having
nothing
of
their
own
indeed
if
any
one
should
leave
to
a
conquered
people
their
rights
as
a
state
still
there
are
some
things
belonging
to
that
state
which
he
might
appropriate
to
himself
for
it
is
in
his
own
power
to
determine
to
what
extent
his
generosity
or
the
exertion
of
his
right
shall
go
caesar
imitated
the
conduct
of
alexander
in
forgiving
the
dyrrachians
a
debt
which
they
owed
to
some
one
of
the
opposite
party
but
the
kind
of
war
in
which
caesar
was
engaged
does
not
fall

the

with

considerable

assign

the
right
of

to
take
place
the
moment
any
one
enters
a
town
or
garrison
of
which
his
sovereign
is
master

according
to
paulus
he
must
have
entered

before
he
can
be
entitled
to

right
upon
this
principle
nations
have
in
general
gone
so
far
as
to
allow
the
right
of
postliminium
to
take
place
where
any
person
or
indeed
any
thing
coming
within
the
privileges
of
postliminium
have
arrived
within
the

used

but
those
who
are
engaged
in
the
same

and
in
a
common
cause
with
that
power
so
that
all
who
have
come
into
the
territories
of
such
powers
are
protected
under
the
pledge
of
public
faith
for
it
makes
no
difference
with
respect
to
persons
or
things
whether
they
are
in
the
territories
of
those
powers
or
in
their
own
in
the
territory
of
a
friendly
power
who
is
not
engaged
in
the
same
cause
with
either
of

belligerent
parties
prisoners
of
war
do
not
change
their
condition
unless
it
has
been
agreed
to
the
contrary
by
express
treaty
as
in
the
second
treaty
between
the
romans
and
carthaginians
it
was
stipulated
that
if
any
prisoners
taken
by
the
carthaginians
from
powers
friendly
to
the
romans
should
come
into
ports
subject
to
the
roman
people
their
liberty
might
be
claimed
and
that
powers
friendly
to
the
carthaginians
should
enjoy
the
same
privilege
for
this
reason
the
roman
prisoners
taken
in
the
second
punic
war
when
sent
into
greece
had
not
the
right
of
postliminium
there
the
greeks
being
entirely
neutral
consequently
they
could
not
be
released
till
they
were
ransomed
iii
according
to
the
language
of
the
ancient
romans
even
free
men
might
be
restored
by
the
right
of
postliminium
gallus
ælius
in
the
first
book
of
his
explanation
of
defines
a
person
restored
to
his
original
situation
by
the
right
of
postliminium
to
be
one
who
had
gone
from
his
own
country
in
a
free
condition
to
another
and
returned
to
his
own
in
consequence
of
such
right
by
the
right
of
postliminium
a
slave
also
who
has
fallen
into
the
hands
of
an
enemy
upon
his
release
from
thence
returns
to
the
service
of
his
former
master
as
to
the
law
of
postliminium
horses
mules
and
ships
are
considered
in
the
same
light
as
slaves
and
whatever
advantage
this
law
gives
any
one
in
recovering
persons
or
things
from
an
enemy
the
enemy
in
his
turn
has
equal
advantage
from
the
same
law
but
modern
lawyers
have
made
a
distinction
between
two
kinds
of
postliminium
by
one
of
which
persons
returned
to
their
former
condition
and
by
the
other
things
are
recovered
iv
the
right
of
postliminium
may
extend
to
those
who
are
seized
and
detained
in
an
enemy
country
upon
the
breaking
out
of
war
for
though
during
the
continuance
of
that
war
there
may
be
reason
for
detaining
them
in
order
to
weaken
the
enemy
strength
yet
upon
the
conclusion
of
a
peace
no
such
motive
and
pretence
can
be
devised
for
their
release
being
refused
or
delayed
it
is
a
settled
point
therefore
that
upon
peace
being
made
prisoners
of
the
above
description
always
obtain
their
liberty
their
claim
to
it
being
universally
acknowledged
with
respect
to
other
kinds
of
prisoners
every
one
used
what
he
wished
to
be
thought
his
right
except
where
fixed
rules
were
prescribed
by
treaty
and
for
the
same
reason
neither
slaves
nor
things
taken
in
war
are
restored
upon
a
peace
except
express
stipulations
be
made
to
that
purpose
a
conqueror
too
in
general
wishes
to
have
it
believed
that
he
had
a
right
to
make
such
acquisition
and
indeed
the
departure
from
such
a
rule
might
give
rise
to
wars
without
end
and
vi
a
prisoner
of
war
upon
his
release
and
return
to
his
own
country
is
entitled
to
all
his
privileges
there
and
indeed
to
everything
either
corporeal
or
incorporeal
which
he
might
have
before
possessed
in
a
neutral
state
at
the
time
of
his
captivity
for
if
such
a
state
in
order
to
preserve
her
neutrality
considered
his
captivity
as
a
matter
of
right
on
the
part
of
the
enemy
so
also
in
order
to
shew
her
impartiality
she
can
not
lawfully
abridge
his
right
to
any
thing
he
may
reclaim
upon
his
release
the
controul
therefore
which
the
person
to
whom
the
prisoner
belonged
by
the
right
of
war
had
over
his
effects
was
not
absolutely
unconditional
for
he
might
lose
it
even
against
his
will
whenever
the
prisoner
came
again
under
the
protection
or
within
the
territories
of
his
own
sovereign
along
with
the
prisoner
therefore
he
would
lose
everything
which
was
considered
as
an
appendage
to
his
person
in
cases
where
effects
taken
in
war
have
been
alienated
a
question
arises
whether
the
law
of
nations
confirms
the
title
and
secures
the
possession
of
the
person
who
has
derived
or
purchased
them
from
him
who
was
master
of
them
by
the
rights
of
war
by
having
the
prisoner
in
his
custody
at
the
time
of
alienation
or
whether
such
things
are
recoverable
supposing
the
things
to
be
in
a
neutral
territory
a
distinction
seems
proper
to
be
made
between
things
recoverable
by
postliminium
and
things
excepted
from
that
right
so
that
every
alienation
of
the
former
must
be
qualified
and
conditional
but
that
of
the
latter
may
be
absolute
by
things
alienated
may
be
understood
even
those
of
which
a
gift
has
been
made
or
to
which
the
owner
has
relinquished
every
claim
vii
upon
any
one
returning
to
his
former
condition
by
the
law
of
postliminium
all
his
rights
are
restored
as
fully
as
if
he
had
never
been
in
the
hands
and
power
of
the
enemy
viii
the
case
of
those
however
who
have
been
conquered
by
the
arms
of
an
enemy
and
have
surrendered
themselves
forms
an
exception
to
this
rule
because
engagements
of
that
kind
must
be
valid
and
honourably
adhered
to
according
to
the
law
of
postliminium
so
that
during
the
time
of
a
truce
the
right
of
postliminium
can
not
be
claimed
but
where
a
surrender
has
been
made
without
any
express
or
positive
convention
the
right
of
postliminium
exists
in
all
its
force
ix
what
has
been
said
of
individuals
applies
to
nations
so
that
a
free
people
who
have
been
subjugated
upon
being
delivered
from
the
yoke
of
the
enemy
by
the
power
of
their
allies
will
recover
their
former
condition
but
if
the
whole
population
that
constituted
a
state
has
been
dispersed
the
people
can
no
longer
be
considered
as
the
same
nor
does
the
law
of
nations
in
such
a
case
enforce
the
right
of
postliminium
for
the
restoration
of
all
effects
formerly
belonging
to
that
people
for
as
the
identity
of
a
ship
or
any
other
material
object
can
only
be
ascertained
by
the
permanent
union
of
its
original
parts
so
a
nation
can
no
longer
be
regarded
as
the
same
when
every
peculiar
characteristic
belonging
to
it
is
effaced
the
state
of
saguntum
therefore
was
no
longer
judged
to
be
the
same
when
it
was
restored
to
its
ancient
possessors
at
the
expiration
of
eight
years
nor
could
thebes
any
longer
be
deemed
the
original
city
as
its
inhabitants
had
been
sold
by
alexander
for
slaves
from
hence
it
is
evident
that
the
thebans
could
not
by
the
right
of
postliminium
recover
the
sum
of
money
which
the
thessalians
had
owed
them
and
that
for
two
reasons
because
in
the
first
place
they
were
a
new
people
and
secondly
because
alexander
at
the
time
that
he
was
absolute
master
of
the
city
had
a
right
if
he
thought
proper
to
relinquish
the
claim
to
that
debt
which
he
had
actually
done
besides
a
debt
is
not
in
the
number
of
things
recoverable
by
the
right
of
postliminium
the
rules
respecting
a
state
are
not
much
unlike
those
laid
down
by
the
ancient
roman
law
which
made
marriage
a
dissoluble
tie
so
that
it
could
not
be
restored
by
the
right
of
postliminium
but
a
new
consent
and
a
new
contract
were
necessary
x
by
the
roman
civil
law
deserters
were
excluded
from
the
right
of
postliminium
xi
and
xii
it
is
a
point
of
much
importance
to
the
subject
and
it
was
before
declared
in
the
affirmative
that
nations
which
have
been
under
a
foreign
yoke
recover
their
former
condition
even
though
their
deliverance
has
not
been
effected
by
their
former
sovereign
but
by
some
ally
it
is
a
settled
rule
where
there
is
no
express
treaty
to
the
contrary
at
the
same
time
it
is
but
reasonable
that
such
ally
be
indemnified
for
the
expences
incurred
in
accomplishing
that
deliverance
xiii
among
things
within
the
right
of
postliminium
lands
in
particular
attract
our
attention
for
as
pomponius
observes
upon
the
expulsion
of
an
enemy
lands
naturally
revert
to
their
former
masters
and
in
this
sense
expulsion
is
understood
to
take
place
from
the
time
that
his
free
and
open
access
to
a
territory
is
entirely
cut
off
thus
the
lacedaemonians
after
taking
aegina
from
the
athenians
restored
it
to
its
ancient
owners
justinian
and
other
emperors
restored
to
the
heirs
of
the
ancient
possessors
of
the
lands
which
had
been
recovered
from
the
goths
and
vandals
still
reserving
against
those
owners
all
prescriptive
rights
which
the
roman
laws
had
introduced
the
privileges
belonging
to
lands
attach
to
every
right
also
connected
with
the
soil
for
religious
or
consecrated
places
that
had
been
taken
by
an
enemy
when
recovered
returned
as
pomponius
has
said
to
their
former
condition
upon
the
same
principle
it
was
provided
by
a
law
in
spain
that
provinces
and
all
other
hereditary
jurisdictions
particularly
supreme
jurisdictions
should
return
to
the
original
possessors
by
the
right
of
postliminium
and
those
of
an
inferior
kind
if
reclaimed
within
the
space
of
four
years
except
that
citadels
lost
by
war
always
belonged
to
the
crown
in
whatever
manner
they
were
recovered
xiv
on
the
contrary
a
general
opinion
prevails
that
moveable
property
which
constitutes
part
of
a
lawful
prize
is
not
recoverable
by
the
right
of
postliminium
so
that
things
acquired
by
purchase
wherever
they
are
found
continue
the
property
of
the
purchaser
nor
has
the
original
owner
a
right
to
claim
them
when
found
in
a
neutral
state
or
even
carried
into
his
own
territory
things
useful
in
war
as
we
find
were
formerly
an
exception
to
this
rule
an
exception
which
seems
to
have
been
favoured
by
the
law
of
nations
in
order
to
induce
men
the
more
readily
to
provide
them
in
the
hopes
of
recovering
them
if
lost
and
this
indulgence
was
the
more
easily
granted
as
most
nations
at
that
period
in
all
their
customs
seem
to
have
had
an
eye
to
a
state
of
among
the
things
coming
under
this
description
ships
of
war
and
are
reckoned
but
neither
gallies
nor
mules
also
are
enumerated
but
only
such
as
are
used
to
carry
baggage
horses
and
mares
too
but
only
such
as
are
broken
in
to
obey
the
bridle
and
these
are
things
the
bequest
of
which
the
roman
law
confirmed
and
which
might
come
into
the
division
of
an
inheritance
arms
and
cloathing
indeed
are
useful
in
war
but
still
they
were
not
recoverable
by
the
right
of
postliminium
because
the
laws
were
by
no
means
inclined
to
favour
those
who
lost
either
in
war
and
such
a
loss
was
deemed
a
disgrace
as
we
find
from
many
parts
of
history
and
in
this
respect
a
distinction
was
made
between
a
soldier
arms
and
his
horse
because
the
latter
might
easily
break
loose
and
fall
into
an
enemy
hands
without
any
fault
of
his
rider
this
distinction
in
moveable
things
seems
to
have
prevailed
in
the
western
parts
of
europe
under
the
goths
even
as
far
down
as
to
the
times
of
boetius
for
in
explaining
the
topics
of
cicero
he
speaks
of
this
right
as
a
general
custom
of
his
day
xv
but
in
later
times
if
not
before
this
distinction
seems
to
have
been
abolished
for
all
intelligent
writers
speak
of
moveable
effects
as
not
recoverable
by
the
right
of
postliminium
and
it
has
evidently
been
decided
so
in
many
places
with
respect
to
ships
xvi
the
right
of
postliminium
is
quite
unnecessary
before
the
things
taken
have
been
carried
into
some
place
of
which
the
enemy
is
master
although
they
may
be
in
his
possession
for
they
have
not
yet
changed
their
owner
by
the
law
of
nations
and
according
to
the
opinions
of
ulpian
and
javolenus
the
law
of
postliminium
is
no
less
superfluous
where
goods
have
been
taken
by
robbers
and
pirates
because
the
law
of
nations
does
not
allow
their
possession
of
the
goods
to
convey
any
change
or
right
of
property
to
them
upon
this
ground
the
athenians
wished
to
consider
philip
as
restoring
and
not
giving
them
halonesus
of
which
they
had
been
robbed
by
pirates
from
whom
he
had
taken
it
again
for
things
taken
by
pirates
may
be
reclaimed
wherever
they
are
found
except
that
natural
justice
requires
that
the
person
who
has
gained
them
out
of
their
hands
at
his
own
expence
should
be
indemnified
in
proportion
to
what
the
owner
himself
would
willingly
have
spent
for
their
recovery
xvii
but
a
different
maxim
may
be
established
by
the
civil
law
thus
by
the
law
of
spain
ships
taken
from
pirates
become
the
lawful
prize
of
the
captors
which
may
seem
a
hardship
upon
the
original
owners
but
in
some
cases
individual
interest
must
be
sacrificed
to
the
public
good
especially
where
the
danger
and
difficulty
of
retaking
the
ships
is
so
great
but
such
a
law
will
not
prevent
foreigners
from
asserting
their
claims
xviii
it
was
rather
a
surprising
maxim
in
the
roman
law
which
established
the
right
of
postliminium
not
only
between
hostile
powers
but
between
all
foreign
states
and
in
some
cases
between
those
who
were
members
of
the
roman
empire
but
this
was
only
a
vestige
of
the
rude
and
pastoral
ages
before
society
was
perfectly
formed
so
that
even
between
nations
who
were
not
engaged
in
public
war
with
each
other
a
kind
of
licence
resembling
that
of
war
prevailed
in
order
to
prevent
such
a
licence
from
proceeding
to
all
the
calamities
and
slaughter
of
war
the
laws
of
captivity
were
introduced
and
as
a
consequence
of
this
postliminium
took
place
which
might
be
considered
as
a
great
step
towards
the
formation
of
equal
treaties
from
the
rules
of
which
pirates
and
robbers
were
excluded
and
which
indeed
they
themselves
despised
xix
in
our
times
the
right
of
making
prisoners
except
in
war
has
been
abolished
not
only
among
christian
states
but
even
among
the
greater
part
of
mahometans
those
bands
of
society
which
nature
designed
to
establish
amongst
men
being
in
some
measure
restored
but
the
ancient
law
of
nations
seems
still
in
force
against
any
rude
or
barbarous
people
who
without
any
declaration
or
cause
of
war
consider
all
mankind
as
enemies
a
decision
has
lately
been
made
in
the
principal
chamber
of
the
parliament
of
paris
declaring
all
effects
belonging
to
the
subjects
of
france

taken
by

algerines

people

engaged
in
predatory
and
maritime
warfare

retaken

war
sometimes
right
and
laudable
to
forbear
punishing
an
inveterate
enemy
every
possible
precaution
requisite
to
spare
the
innocent
especially
children

and
the
aged
except
they
have
committed

ii
cicero
in
the
first
book
of
his
offices
has
finely
observed
that
some
duties
are
to
be
observed
even
towards
those
from
whom
you
have
received
an
injury
for
even
vengeance
and
punishment
have
their
due
bounds
and
at
the
same
time
he
extols
those
ancient
periods
in
the
roman
government
when
the
events
of
war
were
mild
and
marked
with
no
unnecessary
cruelty
the
explanations
given
in
the
first
chapter
of
this
book
will
point
out
the
cases
where
the
destruction
of
an
enemy
is
one
of
the
rights
of
lawful
war
according
to
the
principles
of
strict
and
internal
justice
and
where
it
is
not
so
for
the
death
of
an
enemy
may
proceed
either
from
an
accidental
calamity
or
from
the
fixed
purpose
of
his
destruction
no
one
can
be
justly
killed
by
design
except
by
way
of
legal
punishment
or
to
defend
our
lives
and
preserve
our
property
when
it
can
not
be
effected
without
his
destruction
for
although
in
sacrificing
the
life
of
man
to
the
preservation
of
perishable
possessions
there
may
be
nothing
repugnant
to
strict
justice
it
is
by
no
means
consonant
to
the
law
of
charity
but
to
justify
a
punishment
of
that
kind
the
person
put
to
death
must
have
committed
a
crime
and
such
a
crime
too
as
every
equitable
judge
would
deem
worthy
of
death
points
which
it
is
unnecessary
to
discuss
any
further
as
they
have
been
so
fully
explained
in
the
chapter
on
punishments
iii
in
speaking
of
the
calamities
of
war
as
a
punishment
it
is
proper
to
make
a
distinction
between
misfortune
and
injury
for
a
people
may
sometimes
be
engaged
in
war
against
their
will
where
they
can
not
be
justly
charged
with
entertaining
hostile
intentions
upon
this
subject
velleius
paterculus
observes
that
to
blame
the
athenians
for
revolting
at
the
time
they
were
besieged
by
sylla
betrays
a
total
ignorance
of
history
for
the
athenians
always
continued
so
steady
in
their
attachment
to
the
romans
that
their
fidelity
became
a
proverbial
expression
yet
their
situation
at
that
time
excused
their
conduct
overpowered
by
the
arms
of
mithridates
they
were
obliged
to
submit
to
a
foe
within
while
they
had
to
sustain
a
siege
from
their
friends
without
iv
and
between
complete
injuries
and
pure
misfortunes
there
may
be
sometimes
a
middle
kind
of
actions
partaking
of
the
nature
of
both
which
can
neither
be
said
to
be
done
with
known
and
wilful
intention
nor
yet
excused
under
colour
of
ignorance
and
want
of
inclination
acts
of
pure
misfortune
neither
merit
punishment
nor
oblige
the
party
to
make
reparation
for
the
loss
occasioned
hence
many
parts
of
history
supply
us
with
distinctions
that
are
made
between
those
who
are
the
authors
of
a
war
and
principals
in
it
and
those
who
are
obliged
to
follow
others
as
accessories
in
the
same
vi
but
respecting
the
authors
of
war
a
distinction
is
to
be
made
also
as
to
the
motives
and
causes
of
war
some
of
which
though
not
actually
just
wear
an
appearance
of
justice
that
may
impose
upon
the
well
meaning
the
writer
to
herennius
lays
it
down
as
the
most
equitable
vindication
of
injury
where
the
party
committing
it
has
neither
been
actuated
by
revenge
nor
cruelty
but
by
the
dictates
of
duty
and
an
upright
zeal
cicero
in
the
first
book
of
his
offices
advises
the
sparing
of
those
who
have
committed
no
acts
of
atrocity
and
cruelty
in
war
and
that
wars
undertaken
to
maintain
national
honour
should
be
conducted
upon
principles
of
moderation
and
in
one
of
his
letters
adverting
to
the
war
between
pompey
and
caesar
he
describes
the
struggle
between
those
two
illustrious
men
as
involved
in
so
much
obscurity
of
motives
and
causes
that
many
were
perplexed
in
deciding
which
side
to
embrace
in
his
speech
too
for
marcellus
he
remarks
that
such
uncertainty
might
be
attended
with
error
but
could
never
be
charged
with
guilt
vii
such
forbearance
in
war
is
not
only
a
tribute
to
justice
it
is
a
tribute
to
humanity
it
is
a
tribute
to
moderation
it
is
a
tribute
to
greatness
of
soul
it
was
in
this
moderation
says
sallust
the
foundation
of
roman
greatness
was
laid
tacitus
describes
his
countrymen
as
a
people
no
less
remarkable
for
their
courage
in
the
field
than
for
their
humanity
to
the
vanquished
and
suppliant
on
this
subject
there
is
a
brilliant
passage
in
the
fourth
book
to
herennius
where
it
is
said
it
was
an
admirable
resolution
of
our
ancestors
never
to
deprive
a
captive
prince
of
his
life
for
it
would
be
truly
a
violation
of
common
justice
to
abuse
by
wanton
cruelty
and
rigour
the
power
over
those
whom
fortune
has
put
into
our
hands
by
reducing
them
from
the
high
condition
in
which
she
had
placed
them
before
their
former
enmity
is
forgotten
because
it
is
the
characteristic
of
bravery
to
esteem
opponents
as
enemies
while
contending
for
victory
and
to
treat
them
as
men
when
conquered
in
order
to
soften
the
calamities
of
war
and
improve
the
terms
and
relations
of
peace
but
it
may
be
asked
if
the
enemy
now
treated
with
this
indulgence
would
have
shewn
the
same
lenity
himself
to
which
a
reply
may
be
made
that
he
is
not
an
object
of
imitation
in
what
he
would
have
done
so
much
as
in
what
he
ought
to
have
done
viii
though
there
may
be
circumstances
in
which
absolute
justice
will
not
condemn
the
sacrifice
of
lives
in
war
yet
humanity
will
require
that
the
greatest
precaution
should
be
used
against
involving
the
innocent
in
danger
except
in
cases
of
extreme
urgency
and
utility
ix
after
establishing
these
general
principles
it
will
not
be
difficult
to
decide
upon
particular
cases
seneca
says
that
in
the
calamities
of
war
children
are
exempted
and
spared
on
the
score
of
their
age
and
women
from
respect
to
their
sex
in
the
wars
of
the
hebrews
even
after
the
offers
of
peace
have
been
rejected
god
commands
the
women
and
children
to
be
spared
thus
when
the
ninevites
were
threatened
with
utter
destruction
on
account
of
their
grievous
crimes
a
mitigation
of
the
sentence
was
allowed
in
compassion
to
the
many
thousands
who
were
of
an
age
incapable
of
making
a
distinction
between
right
and
wrong
if
god
from
whose
supreme
gift
the
life
of
man
proceeds
and
on
whose
supreme
disposal
it
depends
prescribes
to
himself
a
rule
like
this
it
is
surely
incumbent
upon
men
who
have
no
commission
but
for
the
welfare
and
preservation
of
the
lives
of
men
to
act
by
the
same
rule
thus
age
and
sex
are
equally
spared
except
where
the
latter
have
departed
from
this
privilege
by
taking
arms
or
performing
the
part
of
men
x
the
same
rule
may
be
laid
down
too
with
respect
to
males
whose
modes
of
life
are
entirely
remote
from
the
use
of
arms
and
in
the
first
class
of
this
description
may
be
placed
the
ministers
of
religion
who
among
all
nations
from
times
of
the
most
remote
antiquity
have
been
exempted
from
bearing
thus
as
may
be
seen
in
sacred
history
the
philistines
being
enemies
of
the
jews
forbore
doing
harm
to
the
company
of
prophets
that
was
at
gaba
and
david
fled
with
samuel
to
another
place
which
the
presence
of
a
prophetic
company
protected
from
all
molestation
and
injury
plutarch
relates
of
the
cretans
that
when
all
order
among
them
was
entirely
broken
by
their
civil
broils
they
abstained
from
offering
violence
to
any
member
of
the
priesthood
or
to
those
employed
in
the
sacred
rites
belonging
to
the
dead
from
hence
the
greeks
came
to
denote
a
general
massacre
by
the
proverbial
expression
of
no
one
being
left
to
carry
fire
to
the
altar
equally
privileged
with
the
holy
priesthood
are
those
who
devote
their
lives
to
the
pursuit
of
letters
and
other
studies
beneficial
to
mankind
xi
diodorus
bestows
an
encomium
upon
the
indians
who
in
all
their
wars
with
each
other
forbore
destroying
or
even
hurting
those
employed
in
husbandry
as
being
the
common
benefactors
of
all
plutarch
relates
the
same
of
the
ancient
corinthians
and
megarensians
and
cyrus
sent
a
message
to
the
king
of
assyria
to
inform
him
that
he
was
willing
to
avoid
molesting
all
who
were
employed
in
tilling
the
ground
xii
to
the
above
catalogue
of
those
exempted
from
sharing
in
the
calamities
of
war
may
be
added
merchants
not
only
those
residing
for
a
time
in
the
enemy
country
but
even
his
and
regular
subjects
artisans
too
and
all
others
are
included
whose
subsistence
depends
upon
cultivating
the
arts
of
peace
xiii
and
xiv
more
civilized
manners
having
abolished
the
barbarous
practice
of
putting
prisoners
to
death
for
the
same
reason
the
surrender
of
those
who
stipulate
for
the
preservation
of
their
lives
either
in
battle
or
in
a
siege
is
not
to
be
rejected
the
romans
when
investing
towns
always
accepted
offers
of
capitulation
if
made
before
the
battering
ram
had
touched
the
walls
caesar
gave
notice
to
the
atuatici
that
he
would
save
their
city
if
they
surrendered
before
the
battering
ram
was
brought
up
and
in
modern
times
it
is
the
usual
practice
before
shells
are
thrown
or
mines
sprung
to
summon
places
to
surrender
which
are
thought
unable
to
hold
out
and
where
places
are
stronger
such
summons
is
generally
sent
before
the
storming
is
made
xv
and
xvi
against
these
principles
of
natural
law
and
equity
an
objection
is
sometimes
derived
from
the
necessity
of
retaliation
or
striking
terror
in
cases
of
obstinate
resistance
but
such
an
objection
is
by
no
means
just
for
after
a
place
has
surrendered
and
there
is
no
danger
to
be
apprehended
from
the
prisoners
there
is
nothing
to
justify
the
further
effusion
of
such
rigour
was
sometimes
practised
where
there
were
any
enormous
acts
of
injustice
or
any
violation
of
faith
it
was
practised
also
upon
deserters
if
taken
sometimes
where
very
important
advantages
may
attend
striking
a
terror
by
preventing
the
same
crimes
in
future
from
being
committed
it
may
be
proper
to
exercise
the
right
of
rigour
in
its
full
extent
but
an
obstinate
resistance
which
can
be
considered
as
nothing
but
the
faithful
discharge
of
a
trust
can
never
come
within
the
description
of
such
delinquencies
as
justify
extreme
rigour
xvii
where
delinquencies
indeed
are
such
as
deserve
death
but
the
number
of
offenders
is
very
great
it
is
usual
from
motives
of
mercy
to
depart
in
some
degree
from
the
right
of
enforcing
the
whole
power
of
the
law
the
authority
for
so
doing
is
founded
on
the
example
of
god
himself
who
commanded
such
offers
of
peace
to
be
made
to
the
canaanites
and
their
neighbours
the
most
wicked
of
any
people
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
as
might
spare
their
lives
upon
the
condition
of
their
becoming
tributaries
xviii
from
the
opinions
advanced
and
maintained
above
it
will
not
be
difficult
to
gather
the
principles
of
the
law
of
nature
respecting
hostages
at
the
time
when
it
was
a
general
opinion
that
every
one
had
the
same
right
over
his
life
as
over
his
property
and
that
right
either
by
express
or
implied
consent
was
transferred
from
individuals
to
the
state
it
is
not
surprising
that
we
should
read
of
hostages
though
harmless
and
innocent
as
individuals
being
punished
for
the
offences
of
the
state
and
in
this
case
the
consent
of
the
state
to
such
a
regulation
implies
that
of
individuals
who
have
originally
resigned
their
own
will
to
that
of
the
public
in
whom
after
such
resignation
it
indubitably
vested
but
when
the
rose
upon
the
world
men
obtaining
clearer
views
of
the
extent
of
their
power
found
that
god
in
giving
man
dominion
over
the
whole
earth
reserved
to
himself
the
supreme
disposal
of
his
life
so
that
man
can
not
resign
to
any
one
the
right
over
his
own
life
or
that
of
another
xix
by
way
of
conclusion
to
this
subject
it
may
be
observed
that
all
actions
no
way
conducive
to
obtain
a
contested
right
or
to
bring
the
war
to
a
termination
but
calculated
merely
to
display
the
strength
of
either
side
are
totally
repugnant
to
the
duties
of
a
christian
and
to
the
principles
of
humanity
so
that
it
behoves
christian
princes
to
prohibit
all
unnecessary
effusion
of
blood
as
they
must
render
an
account
of
their
sovereign
commission
to
him
by
whose
authority
and
in
whose
stead
they
bear
the
sword

i
one
of

three
following
cases
is
requisite
to
justify
any
one
in
destroying

belongs
to
another
there
must
be
either
such
a
necessity
as
at
the
original
institution
of
property
might
be
supposed
to
form
an
exception
as
if
for
instance
any
one
should
throw
the
sword
of
another
into
a
river
to
prevent
a
madman
from
using
it
to
his
destruction

according
to
the
true
principles
maintained
in
a
former
part
of
this
work
he
will
be
bound
to
repair

or
there
must
be
some
debt
arising
from
the
of
an
engagement
where
the
waste
committed
is
considered
as
a
satisfaction
for
that
debt
or
there
must
have
been
some
aggressions
for
which
such
destruction
is
only
an
adequate
punishment
now
driving
off
some
of

never

as

motive
for
laying
waste
the
whole
of

enemy
kingdom
polybius
saw
this
in
its
proper
light
observing
that
vengeance
in
war
should
not
be
carried
to
its
extreme
nor
extend
any
further
than
was
necessary
to
make
an
aggressor
atone
justly
for
his
offence
and
it
is
upon
these
motives
and
within
these
limits
alone
that
punishment
can
be
inflicted
but
except
where
prompted
to
it
by
motives
of
great
utility
it
is
folly
and
worse
than
folly
wantonly
to
hurt
another
but
upon
duly
and
impartially
weighing
the
matter
such
acts
are
oftener
regarded
in
an
odious
light
than
considered
as
the
dictates
of
prudent
and
necessary
counsels
for
the
most
urgent
and
justifiable
motives
are
seldom
of
long
continuance
and
are
often
succeeded
by
weightier
motives
of
a
more
humane
description
ii
it
may
be
possible
under
some
circumstances
to
detain
what
belongs
to
an
enemy
so
as
to
prevent
his
deriving
advantage
from
it
in
which
case
it
would
be
an
unnecessary
and
wanton
act
to
destroy
it
and
to
such
circumstances
the

law
has
an
eye
in
ordering

to
be
made

for
the
construction
of
works
in

and
every

if
possible
to
be
spared
iii
where
there
is
an
expectation
also
of

prudence
will
dictate
to
a
general
or

of

kind
the
necessity
of
forbearing
from
all
acts
of

by
authorising
and
committing

that
are

they
have

to
furnish
them
with

can
avail
themselves

that
under

circumstances
it
is
best
to
leave
agriculture
unmolested
even
on

practice
lately
followed
in
the
wars
of
the
low
countries
where
contributions
were
paid
to

in

for
such
protection
there
are
some
things
of
such
a
nature
as
to
contribute
no

to

which

it
brutal

to
destroy

as
this
rule

is
observed
towards

for
the
reasons
before

there
is
still
greater
reason
why
it
should
be

the

for
although
such
things

edifices
being
the
property
of
the

may
according

the

of

be
with
impunity
demolished
yet
as
they
contribute
nothing
to
aggravate
the
calamities
or
retard
the
successes
of

it
is
a
mark
of
reverence
to
divine
things
to
spare
them
and
all
that
is
connected
therewith
and
more
especially
should
this
rule
be
adhered
to
among
nations

the

according
to
the

fundamental
laws
although
differing
from

by
slight
shades
of
variation
in
their
rights
and
opinions
thucydides
says
that
it
was
a
law
among
the
greeks
of
his
time
in
all
their
invasions
of
each
other
territories
to
forbear
touching
the
edifices
of
religion

likewise
observes
that
upon
the
destruction
of

the

what
has
been
said
of
the
sacred
edifices
of
religion
applies
also
to
monuments
raised
in
honour
of
the
dead
unnecessarily
to
disturb
whose
ashes
in
their
repose
bespeaks
a
total
disregard
to
the
laws
and
ties
of
our
common
humanity
viii
although
it
does
not
fall
within
the
province
of
this
treatise
to
inquire
into
the
utility
of
war
in
all
its
various
branches
but
only
to
regulate
its
practices
by
confining
them
within
due
and
lawful
bounds
yet
it
will
not
be
improper
to
observe
that
rules
and
practices
derive
much
of
their
merit
from
the
utility
with
which
they
are
attended
so
that
one
great
quality
to
recommend
the
moderation
above
alluded
to
will
be
found
in
its
preventing
the
enemy
from
being
driven
to
those
resources
which
men
never
fail
at
last
of
finding
in
despair
it
is
a
just
remark
made
by
some
theologians
that
all
christian
princes
and
rulers
who
wish
to
be
found
such
in
the
sight
of
god
as
well
as
that
of
men
will
deem
it
a
duty
to
interpose
their
authority
to
prevent
or
to
suppress
all
unnecessary
violence
in
the
taking
of
towns
for
acts
of
rigour
can
never
be
carried
to
an
extreme
without
involving
great
numbers
of
the
innocent
in
ruin
and
practices
of
that
kind
besides
being
no
way
conducive
to
the
termination
of
war
are
totally
repugnant
to
every
principle
of
christianity
and
justice

on

in

captures

belonging

the

of

and
taken
detained
as
a
pledge
or
debt
not
to
be
taken
by
way
of
punishment
for
another
offence
the
debt
or
obligation
arising
from
a
state
of
war
illustrated
by
examples
forbearance
in
the
exercise
of
such
a
right
from
principles
of
humanity
i
the
capture
of
an
enemy
goods
even
in
just
war
is
not
in
all
cases
perfectly
justifiable
nor
is
the
captor
always
exempt
from
the
ties
of
restitution
for
strictly
speaking
according
to
the
rules
of
pure
justice
it
is
not
lawful
to
seize
or
detain
goods
except
to
the
exact
amount
of
the
debt
which
the
enemy
has
incurred
indeed
goods
may
be
detained
beyond
that
as
a
necessary
pledge
of
security
but
still
upon
the
condition
of
being
restored
as
soon
as
the
danger
has
ceased
restored
either
literally
or
by
some
proper
compensation
being
made
here
then
is
a
right
of
capture
which
confers
no
right
of
property
or
acquisition
but
when
any
thing
may
become
due
to
us
either
from
a
penalty
or
the
of
an
engagement
in
both
cases
a
right
to
an
enemy
goods
if
they
can
be
taken
is
acquired
by
the
latter
kind
of
debt
not
only
the
effects
of
the
debtor
himself
but
those
belonging
to
his
subjects
may
according
to
the
principles
introduced
by
the
law
of
nations
be
taken
as
a
security
this
right
of
the
law
of
nations
is
very
different
from
that
established
in
impunity
alone
or
depending
upon
the
external
force
of
judicial
authority
for
as
by
our
private
consent
the
person
with
whom
we
contract
acquires
not
only
an
external
and
legal
right
over
our
property
but
an
internal
right
proceeding
from
conscience
so
he
acquires
the
same
right
by
a
kind
of
common
consent
which
virtually
comprehends
the
consent
of
individuals
in
which
sense
the
law
is
called
the
common
compact
or
covenant
of
the
state
and
in
transactions
of
this
kind
it
is
most
likely
that
nations
approving
of
such
a
rule
introduced
a
law
which
might
not
only
prevent
greater
evils
but
also
enable
every
one
to
attain
his
own
right
ii
but
in
the
other
kind
of
debt
arising
from
penalty
or
punishment
it
does
not
appear
that
nations
consented
to
the
establishment
of
any
such
right
over
the
effects
of
subjects
for
binding
the
property
of
one
man
for
the
offence
of
another
is
a
kind
of
odious
act
and
therefore
ought
not
to
be
extended
farther
than
the
law
appears
to
have
actually
decreed
nor
is
the
advantage
derived
from
the
latter
by
any
means
equal
to
that
attending
the
former
kind
of
debt
for
what
is
due
to
us
from
damage
or
the
of
a
treaty
may
be
considered
as
a
part
of
our
effects
but
it
is
not
so
with
the
obligation
to
punishment
which
is
purely
of
a
personal
nature
therefore
no
loss
is
incurred
by
relinquishing
this
right
nor
is
the
argument
in
the
least
weakened
by
what
was
said
before
respecting
the
athenian
law
for
there
it
was
maintained
that
subjects
were
not
bound
to
suffer
because
the
state
was
amenable
to
punishment
but
in
order
to
compel
the
state
to
do
what
she
ought
to
do
in
bringing
the
guilty
to
punishment
a
debt
arising
from
duty
and
relating
to
obligations
of
the
former
kind
rather
than
to
those
of
the
latter
for
there
is
a
difference
between
being
obliged
to
punish
another
and
being
one
self
amenable
to
punishment
tho
the
latter
may
frequently
arise
from
the
neglect
of
doing
the
former
but
still
there
is
the
same
distinction
between
them
as
between
cause
and
effect
the
goods
of
subjects
can
only
be
taken
by
way
of
reprisal
in
return
for
other
goods
taken
by
the
enemy
but
they
can
never
be
taken
as
a
punishment
for
the
neglect
of
bringing
offenders
to
justice
the
delinquents
themselves
in
the
number
of
whom
may
be
reckoned
those
who
have
neglected
to
discharge
their
duty
in
this
respect
must
answer
for
such
offences
iii
the
goods
of
subjects
may
be
taken
and
a
property
acquired
therein
not
only
in
order
to
obtain
payment
of
the
original
debt
which
occasioned
the
war
but
of
other
debts
also
to
which
the
same
war
may
have
given
birth
and
in
this
sense
the
words
of
those
are
to
be
taken
who
maintain
that
captures
in
war
are
not
a
perfect
compensation
for
the
principal
debt
but
only
used
as
a
means
to
enforce
satisfaction
for
the
damages
sustained
from
aggressions
thus
the
romans
in
their
dispute
with
antiochus
as
related
by
livy
thought
it
but
right
for
that
king
to
make
reparation
for
all
the
expenses
incurred
in
the
war
which
he
had
occasioned
indeed
any
terms
that
may
be
justly
imposed
upon
the
conquered
may
justly
be
enforced
by
war
iv
the
right
of
seizing
the
goods
of
the
innocent
subject
of
an
enemy
seems
to
have
been
introduced
in
order
to
compel
the
original
aggressor
or
debtor
to
grant
redress
for
the
injury
he
had
done
and
although
his
falling
on
the
innocent
may
be
no
way
repugnant
to
what
is
legally
right
it
is
in
some
measure
a
departure
from
the
principles
of
humanity
on
the
other
hand
history
especially
the
roman
history
abounds
in
examples
of
humanity
where
lands
have
been
restored
to
a
conquered
enemy
upon
condition
of
their
belonging
to
the
state
and
becoming
subject
to
the
payment
of
a
tribute
chapter

on

dominion
how
far
internal
justice
permits
us
to
acquire
dominion
moderation
in
the
use
of
this
right
over
the
conquered
laudable
incorporating
them
with
the
conquerors
allowing
them
to
retain
their
dominions
placing
garrisons
therein
imposing
tributes
or
other
burdens
utility
of
such
moderation
change
in
the
form
of
a
conquered
government
the
conquered
permitted
to
retain
some
part
of
their
former
liberties
especially
in
matters
of
religion
clemency
to
be
shewn
i
that
equity
and
moderation
towards
individuals
which
are
so
highly
extolled
are
still
more
deserving
of
admiration
when
exercised
towards
nations
and
kingdoms
where
injustice
would
be
attended
with
more
signal
calamities
and
moderation
with
more
beneficial
effects
in
just
war
the
right
of
dominion
over
a
people
and
the
sovereign
power
which
that
people
possess
may
be
acquired
as
well
as
any
other
right
but
the
claims
to
such
a
right
ought
by
no
means
to
be
prosecuted
beyond
indemnity
for
aggression
and
security
against
future
evils
but
this
motive
so
necessary
to
be
observed
especially
in
all
treaties
of
peace
as
well
as
in
the
use
of
victory
is
often
confounded
with
others
in
other
points
a
sovereign
prince
or
state
may
relinquish
a
claim
from
a
principle
of
moderation
but
where
the
future
security
of
their
subjects
is
concerned
it
is
an
act
of
cruelty
rather
than
of
moderation
to
relax
too
far
in
favour
of
a
conquered
enemy
ii
aristotle
has
more
than
once
said
that
war
is
undertaken
for
the
sake
of
peace
and
toil
endured
in
order
to
obtain
rest
and
in
the
same
manner
cicero
has
observed
that
men
go
to
war
that
they
may
live
in
peace
without
molestation
and
injury
war
too
as
we
are
instructed
by
the
teachers
of
true
religion
may
be
made
to
remove
every
thing
that
interrupts
and
stands
in
the
way
of
peace
in
the
primitive
ages
as
we
find
from
history
wars
in
general
were
made
to
preserve
territories
rather
than
to
extend
them
and
any
deviation
from
this
rule
was
thought
unlawful
thus
the
prophet
amos
reproves
the
ammonites
for
their
love
of
making
conquests
iii
the
prudent
moderation
of
the
ancient
romans
approaches
nearly
to
this
model
of
primitive
innocence
for
although
they
made
conquests
they
mitigated
the
fate
of
the
conquered
by
incorporating
them
with
themselves
iv
another
mark
of
moderation
in
the
use
of
victory
is
leaving
to
conquered
kings
or
nations
the
dominions
which
they
lawfully
held
before
polybius
highly
extols
the
merit
and
wisdom
of
antigonus
who
having
sparta
in
his
power
allowed
the
inhabitants
to
retain
their
national
polity
and
freedom
sometimes
indeed
a
conqueror
though
allowing
a
subjugated
people
to
retain
their
dominion
and
sovereignty
must
provide
for
his
own
security
by
placing
garrisons
in
their
country
vi
contributions
too
are
frequently
imposed
and
levied
not
so
much
by
way
of
indemnity
for
expences
incurred
as
for
a
future
security
between
the
conqueror
and
the
conquered
country
upon
the
same
principle
as
was
before
observed
in
explaining
the
nature
of
unequal
treaties
conditions
may
be
imposed
also
requiring
a
conquered
power
to
deliver
up
a
certain
number
of
her
ships
and
forts
and
to
reduce
her
troops
to
a
limited
number
vii
but
leaving
to
conquered
powers
a
part
or
the
whole
of
their
dominions
is
not
only
sometimes
an
act
of
justice
and
humanity
but
an
act
of
sound
policy
also
among
other
of
numa
institutions
his
manner
of
celebrating
the
rites
of
terminus
the
deity
of
boundaries
is
much
commended
for
he
prohibited
the
use
of
blood
in
those
ceremonies
as
an
intimation
that
nothing
was
more
conducive
to
the
peace
and
harmony
of
the
world
than
for
every
nation
to
confine
herself
within
her
proper
bounds
in
conformity
to
which
maxim
florus
observes
that
it
is
more
easy
to
make
conquests
than
to
keep
them
to
which
rule
plato
in
his
third
book
of
laws
adapts
the
proverbial
expression
of
hesiod
that
half
is
better
than
the
whole
viii
the
lacedaemonians
and
the
athenians
anciently
claimed
no
farther
dominion
over
conquered
cities
and
states
than
purely
wishing
them
to
adopt
forms
of
government
like
their
own
the
lacedaemonians
living
under
an
aristocratic
and
the
athenians
under
a
democratic
system
but
whether
such
changes
were
conducive
to
a
conqueror
security
it
is
not
to
our
present
purpose
to
examine
ix
if
it
is
not
perfectly
safe
to
forbear
exercising
any
dominion
over
a
conquered
enemy
the
matter
may
be
so
regulated
as
to
leave
him
some
portion
of
his
former
sovereignty
and
power
thus
among
the
jews
the
sceptre
remained
with
the
sanhedrim
even
after
archelaus
was
deprived
of
his
kingdom
and
alexander
in
many
cases
allowed
darius
to
remain
a
sovereign
over
others
while
he
required
of
him
submission
to
himself
x
even
though
a
conquered
power
was
deprived
of
all
sovereignty
she
might
be
allowed
to
retain
some
of
her
laws
privileges
and
magistracies
of
inferior
importance
thus
pliny
in
his
letters
informs
us
that
in
the
proconsular
province
of
bithynia
the
city
of
apamaea
was
allowed
to
regulate
the
form
of
her
government
at
her
own
pleasure
and
in
other
places
the
bithynians
were
permitted
to
retain
their
own
magistrates
and
their
own
senate
xi
this
indulgence
ought
to
be
shewn
to
every
people
especially
in
their
attachment
to
the
religion
of
their
forefathers
of
which
they
should
never
be
deprived
but
with
their
own
consent
and
conviction
an
indulgence
which
agrippa
in
his
address
to
caius
as
cited
by
philo
in
the
account
of
his
embassy
approves
of
as
highly
grateful
to
the
conquered
people
and
by
no
means
prejudicial
to
the
conqueror
at
the
same
time
a
conqueror
will
take
care
that
erroneous
opinions
do
not
prevail
to
the
prejudice
and
overthrow
of
true
religion
as
was
done
by
constantine
upon
his
crushing
the
party
of
licinius
and
afterwards
by
the
franks
and
other
kings

war
become
the
property
of
the
captors
has
been
explained
before
from
which
a
deduction
must
be
made
of
things
recoverable
by
the
right
postliminium
those
being
no
captures
at
all
but
things
taken
in
unjust
war
are
to
be
restored
not
only
by
those
who
have
taken
them
but
by
others
also
into
whose
hands
they
may
have
by
any
means
fallen
for
as
the
roman
lawyers
say
no
one
can
convey
to
another
a
greater
right
than
he
himself
possesses
the
original
captor
had
no
just
title
to
any
property
therein
neither
can
the
person
deriving
his
title
through
him
establish
any
better
a
second
or
third
possessor
may
have
acquired
a
property
therein
which
the
law
presumes
he
has
a
right
to
till
the
contrary
be
shewn
and
for
which
an
action
may
be
maintained
yet
it
is
a
right
of
which
he
can
not
honestly
avail
himself
against
the
real
owner
from
whom
it
was
unjustly
taken
ii
and
iii
therefore
such
things
are
to
be
restored
to
those
from
whom
they
were
taken
which
we
find
in
ancient
times
was
often
done
livy
in
relating
the
defeat
of
the
volscians
and
aequi
by
a
roman
consul
says
that
the
booty
was
exposed
in
a
public
place
for
the
space
of
three
days
that
every
one
coming
to
recognise
what
belonged
to
him
might
take
it
away
but
if
any
one
has
become
possessed
of
such
a
thing
by
purchase
it
may
be
asked
if
he
can
charge
the
person
from
whom
it
was
originally
taken
with
the
price
which
he
has
paid
for
it
according
to
the
principles
before
laid
down
he
certainly
may
charge
as
much
to
the
person
losing
it
as
the
repossession
of
a
thing
which
he
despaired
of
ever
recovering
is
worth
the
history
of
abraham
seems
applicable
to
this
subject
when
he
returned
from
his
victory
over
the
five
kings
being
a
man
of
noble
and
exalted
piety
he
would
appropriate
nothing
to
himself
but
considering
the
things
retaken
as
his
own
right
in
recompence
for
his
labour
and
danger
he
devoted
a
tenth
part
to
god
after
deducting
the
necessary
expences
and
divided
a
certain
portion
among
his
companions
iv
as
things
are
to
be
restored
to
their
original
owners
so
subjects
are
to
be
restored
to
their
former
lawful
sovereigns
the
period
also
when
the
obligation
to
restitution
expires
is
often
a
subject
of
inquiry
but
this
is
a
question
when
arising
between
subjects
of
the
same
kingdom
which
must
be
settled
by
the
municipal
laws
of
that
country
but
when
the
contending
parties
are
the
subjects
of
foreign
powers
the
matter
can
only
be
decided
upon
a
conjecture
of
the
time
sufficient
to
constitute
a
presumed
dereliction
of
property
vi
but
where
the
right
of
war
is
doubtful
it
will
be
safest
to
follow
the
conduct
of
aratus
of
sicyon
in
advising
the
new
possessors
in
some
measure
to
prefer
taking
a
sum
money
in
lieu
of
the
possession
and
recommending
the
same
maxim
to
the
original
owners
to
prefer
a
sum
of
money
if
they
could
obtain
it
equivalent
to
the
recovery
of
their
right
chapter
xvii
respecting
those
who
are
neutral
in
war
nothing
to
be
taken
belonging
to
neutrals
but
under
circumstances
of
extreme
necessity
and
with
an
intention
to
pay
the
full
price
of
it
conduct
of
neutral
powers
towards
belligerents
i
it
may
appear
superfluous
to
speak
of
neutral
powers
against
whom
no
rights
of
war
can
exist
but
as
war
under
the
plea
of
necessity
occasions
many
aggressions
to
be
committed
against
them
especially
when
bordering
upon
the
seat
of
its
operations
it
may
be
necessary
briefly
to
repeat
a
former
assertion
that
nothing
short
of
extreme
exigency
can
give
one
power
a
right
over
what
belongs
to
another
no
way
involved
in
the
war
the
case
too
is
equally
clear
that
no
emergency
can
justify
any
one
in
taking
and
applying
to
his
own
use
what
the
owner
stands
in
equal
need
of
himself
but
even
where
the
emergency
can
be
plainly
proved
nothing
can
justify
us
in
taking
or
applying
the
property
of
another
to
our
use
beyond
the
immediate
demands
of
that
emergency
where
the
custody
of
a
thing
by
securing
it
is
sufficient
for
the
purpose
the
use
and
consumption
of
it
is
absolutely
unlawful
if
the
use
of
it
is
necessary
it
must
not
be
abused
and
if
the
entire
abuse
of
it
be
requisite
the
full
value
should
be
paid
ii
again
according
to
what
was
said
in
a
preceding
part
of
this
book
it
is
the
duty
of
those
who
profess
neutrality
in
a
war
to
do
nothing
towards
increasing
the
strength
of
a
party
maintaining
an
unjust
cause
nor
to
impede
the
measures
of
a
power
engaged
in
a
just
and
righteous
cause
but
in
doubtful
cases
they
ought
to
shew
themselves
impartial
to
both
sides
and
to
give
no
succour
to
besieged
places
but
should
allow
the
troops
of
each
to
march
through
the
country
and
to
purchase
forage
and
other
supplies
the
corcyraeans
in
thucydides
say
that
if
the
athenians
intend
to
remain
neuter
they
ought
either
to
prohibit
the
corinthians
from
enlisting
men
in
the
territory
of
attica
or
to
give
them
the
same
privilege
the
romans
objected
to
the
conduct
of
philip
king
of
macedon
charging
him
with
a
double
violation
of
treaties
both
by
injuring
the
allies
of
the
roman
people
and
assisting
the
enemy
with

chapter

on
good
faith
between
enemies
good
faith
due
to
enemies
of
every
description
due
even
to
pirates
and
others
of
the
same
kind
in
all
treaties
with
them
a
promise
given
to
them
binding
when
not
extorted
by
fear
oaths
to
be
inviolably
observed
the
law
of
nations
does
not
allow
fear
to
be
alleged
as
an
exception
to
the
above
rules
good
faith
to
be
observed
even
to
a
treacherous
enemy
this
obligation
ceases
where
one
of
the
parties
violates
his
engagements
or
refuses
a
just
compensation
even
where
the
obligation
arose
from
a
different
contract
from
loss
occasioned
or
from
a
penalty
application
of
these
principles
to
war
i
it
was
before
said
that
the
number
and
extent
of
actions
lawful
in
war
may
be
considered
either
upon
their
own
intrinsic
merits
or
as
rising
out
of
some
antecedent
engagement
the
former
point
having
before
been
fully
explained
this
is
the
proper
place
for
discussing
the
latter
which
comprehends
the
good
faith
of
enemies
towards
each
other
cicero
in
his
fifth
book
on
the
bounds
of
good
and
evil
has
well
observed
that
every
one
must
approve
and
commend
a
disposition
to
adhere
faithfully
to
our
engagements
not
only
from
disinterested
motives
but
in
some
cases
even
in
opposition
to
our
own
interest
and
augustine
says
that
it
is
right
to
maintain
the
pledge
of
faith
given
to
an
enemy
for
under
the
character
of
enemies
men
do
not
lose
their
right
to
the
fulfilment
of
a
promise
a
right
which
every
one
possessed
of
reason
is
capable
of
it
is
the
power
of
reason
and
speech
from
which
the
obligation
of
promises
springs
nor
is
it
to
be
supposed
that
because
it
is
lawful
to
deceive
an
enemy
on
some
occasions
the
same
rule
will
authorise
a
violation
of
faith
in
engagements
for
the
obligation
to
speak
the
truth
arises
from
causes
antecedent
in
their
existence
to
any
state
of
warfare
and
they
are
causes
which
a
state
of
warfare
may
render
it
necessary
to
change
or
abridge
but
a
promise
confers
a
new
right
of
itself
a
distinction
which
did
not
escape
the
notice
of
aristotle
who
in
speaking
of
truth
says
that
he
does
not
consider
truth
and
sincerity
in
engagements
with
relation
to
justice
or
injustice
but
as
belonging
to
another
class
of
virtues
ii
as
to
engagements
with
pirates
we
may
observe
that
pompey
in
a
great
measure
concluded
the
disputes
with
them
by
treaty
sparing
their
lives
and
allowing
them
places
to
reside
in
on
condition
of
their
abandoning
their
former
way
of
life
the
law
of
nations
indeed
has
not
established
the
same
mode
of
communication
with
them
as
among
regular
enemies
in
just
and
lawful
war
but
still
the
very
circumstance
of
their
being
men
entitles
them
to
those
privileges
which
are
sanctioned
by
the
law
of
nature
among
which
the
observance
of
engagements
is
one
iii
let
us
consider
if
a
more
specious
argument
than
cicero
may
not
be
devised
on
this
in
the
first
place
it
may
be
stated
that
atrocious
malefactors
forming
no
part
of
a
state
may
be
punished
by
any
one
whatever
according
to
the
law
of
nature
for
those
who
may
be
punished
with
death
may
upon
the
same
principle
be
deprived
of
their
property
and
all
their
rights
and
among
rights
may
be
enumerated
the
right
of
requiring
a
fulfilment
of
promises
and
engagements
the
guilty
may
therefore
be
deprived
of
this
right
by
way
of
penalty
in
reply
to
which
it
may
be
said
this
will
certainly
be
the
case
if
the
person
is
treated
with
but
not
as
a
malefactor
for
the
very
act
of
treating
with
him
shews
that
he
is
not
considered
any
longer
in
that
light
but
as
one
entitled
to
all
the
rights
of
treaty
the
criminal
part
of
his
character
not
being
taken
into
the
account
all
penalties
on
that
score
being
as
it
were
remitted
for
every
act
of
treaty
must
be
interpreted
so
as
to
avoid
absurdity
iv
an
objection
to
treating
with
pirates
upon
principles
of
good
faith
is
deduced
from
their
calling
which
is
to
extort
terms
by
fear
now
where
a
promise
has
been
extorted
the
promisor
is
released
from
his
engagement
as
having
unjustly
sustained
a
damage
by
an
act
repugnant
to
the
nature
of
human
liberty
and
to
the
nature
of
human
action
which
ought
to
be
free
this
it
must
be
admitted
may
sometimes
happen
but
does
not
apply
to
all
promises
made
to
pirates
for
to
make
the
person
to
whom
a
promise
has
been
given
liable
to
release
the
engagement
the
promiser
himself
must
have
been
forced
to
give
the
promise
under
impressions
of
unjust
fear
so
that
if
any
one
has
promised
a
ransom
in
order
to
redeem
a
friend
from
captivity
he
will
be
bound
by
his
promise
for
in
this
case
there
was
no
impression
of
fear
as
he
came
voluntarily
to
make
the
contract
a
promise
too
made
through
the
compulsion
of
fear
will
be
binding
where
it
has
been
ratified
by
the
solemn
sanction
of
an
oath
for
in
that
case
it
is
not
only
one
man
making
an
engagement
to
a
fellow
creature
but
binding
himself
to
god
by
the
most
solemn
appeal
against
which
neither
fear
nor
any
other
motive
can
form
an
exception
yet
the
heir
of
a
promiser
is
not
bound
by
any
such
obligation
because
inheritances
pass
according
to
the
rules
of
human
intercourse
established
at
the
original
institution
of
property
but
the
divine
right
to
the
fulfilment
of
oaths
as
such
is
not
included
in
these
from
the
above
arguments
a
conclusion
may
be
deduced
that
if
any
one
violates
a
pledge
given
to
such
an
enemy
either
upon
oath
or
without
oath
he
will
not
on
that
account
be
liable
to
punishment
among
other
nations
because
from
the
general
horror
which
piracy
excites
nations
have
thought
proper
to
pass
over
without
notice
the
violation
of
rules
of
faith
towards
them
xi
solemn
war
signifying
such
as
is
proclaimed
and
begun
on
both
sides
by
authority
of
the
sovereign
or
state
among
its
many
other
legal
rights
includes
also
that
of
giving
validity
to
every
promise
which
may
be
conducive
to
its
termination
so
that
if
either
party
through
an
fear
of
further
calamities
has
even
against
his
will
made
promises
unfavourable
or
acceded
to
terms
disadvantageous
to
himself
such
an
engagement
will
be
binding
for
the
law
of
nations
allows
belligerent
powers
to
alarm
each
other
if
possible
into
submission
upon
the
most
unequal
terms
in
the
same
manner
as
it
gives
a
sanction
to
many
things
not
strictly
equitable
according
to
natural
and
municipal
law
for
if
such
a
practice
had
not
been
established
wars
which
are
so
frequent
could
never
have
been
brought
to
a
conclusion
an
object
so
much
for
the
interest
of
mankind
these
are
the
rights
of
war
which
cicero
says
ought
to
be
inviolably
preserved
with
an
enemy
for
an
enemy
not
only
retains
his
natural
rights
in
war
but
certain
other
rights
originating
in
the
consent
of
nations
yet
it
does
not
follow
from
hence
that
any
one
who
has
extorted
such
a
promise
in
unjust
war
can
consistently
with
piety
and
the
duties
of
a
good
man
retain
what
he
has
so
received
nor
can
he
compel
another
to
stand
to
such
engagements
whether
upon
oath
or
not
for
the
natural
and
internal
injustice
of
such
a
promise
always
remains
the
same
nor
can
the
injustice
be
removed
or
altered
till
it
has
received
a
new
and
free
concurrence
from
the
party
by
whom
it
was
given
xii
the
only
impressions
of
fear
that
can
be
lawfully
inspired
in
regular
war
are
those
which
are
approved
of
by
the
law
of
nations
thus
no
one
can
avail
himself
of
a
promise
extorted
from
an
ambassador
under
impressions
of
fear
excited
by
the
seizing
of
his
person
xiii
and
xiv
there
are
two
cases
in
which
a
person
may
not
perform
his
engagement
or
promise
without
being
guilty
of
treachery
and
those
are
where
the
conditions
have
not
been
fulfilled
or
some
compensation
has
been
made
for
in
one
and
the
same
treaty
all
the
clauses
seem
connected
with
each
other
as
a
kind
of
condition
expressing
the
intention
of
one
party
to
fulfil
his
engagement
if
the
other
shall
do
the
same
therefore
tullus
in
replying
to
the
albans
invokes
destruction
upon
the
head
of
that
people
who
first
rejected
the
just
claims
of
ambassadors
demanding
restitution
wishing
that
all
the
calamities
of
war
might
fall
upon
them
for
says
ulpian
he
shall
no
longer
be
held
as
a
confederate
who
has
renounced
a
treaty
owing
to
some
condition
on
which
it
was
made
not
being
fulfilled
for
which
reason
wherever
it
is
intended
otherwise
it
is
usually
stated
in
express
terms
that
the
violation
of
any
particular
clause
shall
not
annul
the
whole
treaty
xv
the
origin
of
compensation
was
explained
in
the
second
book
of
this
treatise
where
it
was
said
to
be
the
power
and
right
of
receiving
an
equivalent
for
some
thing
belonging
to
us
which
is
in
the
hands
of
another
or
any
thing
due
to
us
which
we
can
not
otherwise
obtain
and
much
more
then
have
we
a
right
on
the
same
account
to
detain
any
thing
which
is
already
in
our
power
whether
it
be
of
a
corporeal
or
an
incorporeal
kind
so
that
we
are
not
obliged
to
perform
a
promise
if
it
be
no
more
than
equivalent
to
a
thing
of
ours
which
the
other
party
detains
seneca
in
his
sixth
book
on
benefits
says
that
a
creditor
often
becomes
under
an
obligation
to
his
debtor
if
he
takes
more
than
an
equivalent
for
his
debt
for
though
it
may
be
granted
that
he
has
lent
money
yet
if
by
such
a
loan
he
has
obtained
the
possession
of
lands
which
he
never
bought
he
changes
situations
with
his
debtor
and
becomes
a
debtor
in
his
turn
xvi
it
will
be
the
same
if
one
of
the
contracting
parties
owes
as
much
or
more
from
some
other
engagement
and
the
debt
can
not
otherwise
be
obtained
than
by
taking
advantage
of
the
present
contract
though
it
has
no
connection
with
the
former
debt
but
in
a
legal
point
of
view
all
actions
are
perfectly
distinct
nor
can
their
forms
their
grounds
or
their
substance
be
confounded
but
certain
cases
are
confined
to
certain
laws
to
which
it
is
necessary
invariably
to
adhere
one
law
can
not
be
mixed
with
another
but
every
one
in
the
prosecution
of
a
right
must
tread
upon
invariable
and
beaten
ground
but
the
law
of
nations
does
not
regard
such
distinctions
it
allows
us
to
transgress
them
where
there
is
no
other
means
of
obtaining
our
right
xvii
and
xviii
the
same
may
be
said
too
where
the
party
exacting
a
promise
has
not
contracted
any
debt
by
engagement
but
has
done
an
injury
to
the
promiser
and
whatever
is
due
by
way
of
punishment
may
be
balanced
against
a
promise
xix
if
while
a
is
depending
the
parties
enter
into
an
agreement
of
any
kind
either
to
pay
the
costs
or
to
make
good
other
damages
they
can
not
avail
themselves
both
of
this
agreement
and
claim
a
further
compensation
for
the
original
matter
in
dispute
in
the
same
manner
if
during
the
continuance
of
a
war
the
belligerents
negotiate
for
a
conclusion
of
the
original
dispute
they
are
supposed
thereby
to
settle
every
cause
of
hostility
nor
can
they
any
further
avail
themselves
of
the
rights
of
war
so
as
to
enjoy
both
the
advantages
of
them
and
of
negotiation
at
the
same
time
for
if
this
were
the
case
no
treaties
could
ever
be
enforced
with
certainty
it
may
be
asked
of
what
nature
are
the
things
for
which
a
promise
of
compensation
should
be
given
in
answer
to
which
it
may
be
observed
that
such
a
promise
or
engagement
may
be
made
in
lieu
of
some
other
obligation
incurred
during
the
course
of
a
war
as
for
instance
where
the
breach
of
a
truce
has
been
committed
the
rights
of
an
ambassador
violated
or
any
other
action
done
repugnant
to
the
principles
established
by
the
law
of
nations
among
belligerent
powers
still
it
must
be
observed
that
the
parties
in
making
compensation
should
abstain
with
the
utmost
caution
from
infringing
upon
the
rights
of
a
third
person
especially
where
this
can
be
done
without
abandoning
the
principles
of
the
law
of
nations
which
makes
the
effects
of
subjects
answerable
for
the
debts
of
the
state
besides
it
is
the
mark
of
a
dignified
mind
to
adhere
to
engagements
even
after
receiving
an
injury
on
which
account
the
indian
sage
jarchas
commended
that
king
who
on
sustaining
an
injury
from
a
neighbouring
and
confederate
power
said
he
should
not
think
himself
released
from
his
sworn
engagements
which
were
solemn
acts
that
no
injustice
on
the
part
of
another
could
repeal
almost
all
questions
relating
to
pledges
of
faith
given
by
one
belligerent
power
to
another
may
be
solved
upon
the
principles
before
laid
down
in
explaining
the
nature
and
force
of
promises
in

of

and

also
in

the

of
the
obligations
of
kings
and

in
order
to
remove
every

a

and

it
is

power
alone
that

can

rights
of

in
the
termination
of
every
war
either
the
principal
or

causes
are
to
be
considered

regarded
as
the
principal
instrument
by
which
wars
are
ended
and
the
mediation
or

of

or

is
deemed
a
secondary
or

means
ii
the
person
who
has
authority
to
begin
a
war
is
the
only
one
to
whom
the
right
of
making
peace
can
properly
belong
according
to
the
general
maxim
that
every
one
is
the
best
judge
in
the
management
of
his
own
affairs
from
hence
it
follows
that
public
war
can
be
made
by
the
sovereign
power
alone
on
each
side
a
right
which
in
every
kingly
government
is
very
justly
vested
in
the
crown
iii
and
iv
in
popular
or
aristocratic
forms
of
government
the
right
of
making
war
or
concluding
peace
is
generally
lodged
in
some
public
council
or
body
where
a
majority
of
voices
may
form
treaties
conventions
or
resolutions
which
will
be
binding
upon
the
dissentient
part
of
such
council
and
all
who
are
bound
by
a
peace
whether
approving
it
or
not
are
entitled
to
its
benefits
in
examining
those
objects
which
form
the
most
material
part
of
treaties
we
may
observe
that
kingdoms
are
not
so
much
a
patrimony
which
may
be
alienated
at
pleasure
as
a
trust
placed
in
the
hands
of
the
sovereign
for
the
benefit
of
his
people
indeed
kings
themselves
are
aware
of
this
even
before
the
crown
descends
upon
their
heads
and
they
receive
it
upon
condition
of
adhering
to
such
sacred
obligations
nor
can
such
alienations
ever
be
made
so
as
to
be
attended
with
consequences
like
those
of
private
contracts
or
to
render
the
goods
and
effects
of
subjects
answerable
for
such
engagements
for
if
that
were
the
case
the
fundamental
laws
of
the
kingdom
prohibiting
such
alienations
would
be
of
no
effect
to
render
the
alienation
of
the
whole
public
dominion
valid
the
consent
of
the
constituted
authorities
of
the
state
is
requisite
and
indeed
to
confirm
the
transfer
of
any
particular
portion
the
consent
of
the
whole
body
as
well
as
of
that
particular
member
will
be
necessary
for
otherwise
such
alienation
would
be
like
the
violent
separation
of
a
limb
from
the
natural
body
a
whole
people
may
in
a
case
of
extreme
necessity
transfer
themselves
to
the
dominion
of
another
a
right
which
undoubtedly
was
reserved
at
the
original
formation
of
society
neither
is
there
any
thing
to
prevent
a
king
from
alienating
his
patrimonial
and
private
possessions
yet
there
may
be
parts
of
the
royal
dominion
which
the
sovereign
can
not
alienate
from
the
crown
especially
if
he
has
received
it
upon
condition
of
making
no
personal
appropriation
of
any
thing
belonging
thereto
there
are
two
ways
in
which
the
possessions
of
the
crown
may
become
the
patrimony
of
the
king
either
as
separable
or
inseparable
parts
of
the
kingdom
in
the
latter
case
they
can
only
be
transferred
with
the
kingdom
itself
but
in
the
former
they
may
be
alienated
by
themselves
and
where
the
crown
is
not
patrimonial
and
hereditary
the
restrictions
upon
the
sovereign
in
this
respect
are
much
greater
vi
a
nation
and
a
king
successors
are
bound
by
his
engagements
in
proportion
to
the
power
which
he
derives
from
the
constitution
of
making
such
engagements
for
though
this
power
may
not
be
absolutely
unlimited
yet
it
ought
not
to
be
clogged
with
unnecessary
restrictions
it
should
be
such
as
may
enable
him
to
exercise
his
discretion
and
judgment
on
proper
occasions
for
the
benefit
of
his
people
the
case
will
be
different
where
a
king
power
over
his
subjects
is
like
that
of
a
master
over
his
household
more
than
of
a
sovereign
over
his
state
as
where
he
has
entirely
subjugated
a
people
or
where
his
controul
over
their
property
is
absolute
thus
pharaoh
purchased
all
the
land
in
egypt
and
others
have
admitted
strangers
into
their
territories
allowing
them
to
hold
lands
upon
such
conditions
for
here
there
is
another
right
in
addition
to
that
of
a
sovereign
and
it
is
a
right
which
sovereignty
alone
without
conquest
could
never
have
conferred
vii
the
right
of
sovereigns
to
dispose
of
the
effects
of
individuals
in
order
to
make
peace
is
often
a
disputed
point
nor
can
they
exercise
this
right
over
the
property
of
subjects
in
any
other
manner
than
as
sovereigns
the
property
of
subjects
is
so
far
under
the
eminent
controul
of
the
state
that
the
state
or
the
sovereign
who
represents
it
can
use
that
property
or
destroy
it
or
alienate
it
not
only
in
cases
of
extreme
necessity
which
sometimes
allow
individuals
the
liberty
of
infringing
upon
the
property
of
others
but
on
all
occasions
where
the
public
good
is
concerned
to
which
the
original
framers
of
society
intended
that
private
interests
should
give
way
but
when
that
is
the
case
it
is
to
be
observed
the
state
is
bound
to
repair
the
losses
of
individuals
at
the
public
expence
in
aid
of
which
the
sufferers
have
contributed
their
due
proportion
nor
will
the
state
though
unable
to
repair
the
losses
for
the
present
be
finally
released
from
the
debt
but
whenever
she
possesses
the
means
of
repairing
the
damages
the
dormant
claim
and
obligation
will
be
revived
viii
there
must
be
some
hesitation
in
admitting
the
opinion
of
ferdinand
vasquez
who
maintains
that
the
state
is
not
bound
to
repair
the
losses
which
are
occasioned
to
individuals
in
the
course
of
war
as
those
are
accidents
permitted
by
the
rights
of
war
for
those
rights
regard
the
relation
of
foreign
states
and
enemies
to
each
other
but
bear
no
reference
to
the
disputes
of
subjects
among
themselves
who
being
united
in
the
same
cause
ought
to
share
the
common
losses
which
happen
to
them
in
supporting
the
privileges
of
their
society
it
is
a
rule
likewise
established
by
the
civil
law
that
no
action
can
be
brought
against
the
state
for
the
losses
sustained
in
war
as
every
one
is
thereby
induced
to
defend
his
own
property
with
more
earnestness
and
spirit
ix
some
make
a
distinction
between
the
property
which
subjects
are
entitled
to
from
the
law
of
nations
and
that
which
they
possess
by
the
authority
of
the
civil
law
allowing
the
king
a
more
extensive
controul
over
the
latter
even
to
the
power
of
taking
it
without
cause
or
compensation
which
is
not
the
case
with
property
of
the
former
kind
but
this
is
an
improper
distinction
for
whatever
may
be
the
origin
of
property
it
is
always
attended
with
peculiar
effects
according
to
the
law
of
nature
so
that
it
can
not
be
taken
away
for
any
other
reasons
than
those
inherent
in
the
nature
of
property
itself
or
derived
from
some
act
of
the
owners
x
the
prohibition
respecting
the
property
of
individuals
being
given
up
except
for
some
public
advantage
is
a
matter
resting
entirely
between
a
sovereign
and
his
subjects
and
a
compensation
for
losses
is
an
affair
between
the
state
and
individuals
but
in
all
transactions
between
a
king
and
foreigners
the
act
of
the
king
is
sufficient
to
give
them
national
validity
not
only
out
of
respect
to
his
personal
dignity
but
according
to
the
law
of
nations
which
renders
the
effects
of
subjects
responsible
for
the
acts
of
the
sovereign
xi
in
interpreting
treaties
of
peace
favourable
circumstances
are
always
to
be
taken
in
their
utmost
latitude
and
unfavourable
circumstances
to
be
limited
as
strictly
as
possible
regarding
purely
the
law
of
nature
the
most
favourable
construction
is
that
whereby
every
one
is
restored
to
his
own
property
and
possessions
therefore
where
the
articles
of
a
treaty
are
ambiguous
the
construction
should
go
so
far
as
to
grant
the
party
who
has
evidently
justice
on
his
side
the
object
for
which
he
went
to
war
and
likewise
indemnity
for
the
losses
which
he
has
sustained
but
it
is
not
allowable
that
either
party
should
gain
more
than
an
indemnity
or
demand
any
thing
by
way
of
punishment
which
is
of
an
odious
nature
as
in
making
peace
it
scarcely
ever
happens
that
either
party
will
acknowledge
the
injustice
of
his
cause
or
of
his
claims
such
a
construction
must
be
given
as
will
equalize
the
pretensions
of
each
side
which
may
be
accomplished
either
by
restoring
the
disputed
possessions
to
their
former
situation
or
by
leaving
them
in
the
state
to
which
the
war
has
reduced
them
xii
of
these
two
methods
in
a
doubtful
case
the
latter
is
preferred
as
being
the
more
easily
adjusted
and
occasioning
no
further
change
from
hence
the
right
of
postliminium
belongs
to
such
prisoners
as
are
expressly
included
in
the
treaty
neither
are
deserters
to
be
given
up
unless
it
be
so
agreed
for
by
the
laws
of
war
any
power
is
allowed
to
receive
deserters
and
even
to
enlist
them
in
his
own
army
by
such
agreement
other
things
remain
in
the
hands
of
the
possessors
by
which
is
not
meant
a
civil
but
a
natural
possession
for
in
war
bare
possession
is
sufficient
nor
is
any
other
kind
looked
for
and
lands
are
said
to
be
so
possessed
when
inclosed
or
defended
by
fortifications
for
a
temporary
occupation
by
an
encampment
is
not
regarded
in
this
case
hence
demosthenes
in
his
speech
for
ctesiphon
says
that
philip
was
anxious
to
make
himself
master
of
all
the
places
he
could
seize
as
he
knew
that
upon
the
conclusion
of
a
peace
he
should
retain
them
incorporeal
rights
can
not
be
held
but
by
the
occupation
of
the
things
with
which
they
are
connected
as
for
instance
the
services
of
lands
or
through
means
of
the
persons
to
whom
they
belong
but
the
holders
of
such
rights
lose
them
when
an
enemy
has
become
master
of
the
country
xiii
in
that
other
mode
of
treaty
whereby
possession
that
has
been
disturbed
in
the
course
of
a
war
is
restored
it
is
proper
to
observe
that
the
last
possession
immediately
before
the
war
began
is
that
which
is
always
meant
so
that
the
individuals
then
unjustly
ejected
may
have
recourse
to
law
either
to
obtain
possession
by
a
provisional
decree
or
to
make
good
their
claim
xiv
if
an
independent
people
voluntarily
and
spontaneously
place
themselves
under
the
controul
and
protection
of
one
of
the
belligerent
powers
such
a
people
can
not
be
included
among
those
entitled
to
restitution
which
only
belongs
to
those
who
have
suffered
losses
by
violence
through
fear
or
any
lawful
stratagem
of
war
thus
when
peace
was
made
among
the
grecian
states
the
thebans
retained
plataea
observing
that
they
neither
owed
their
possession
of
it
to
violence
nor
treachery
but
to
the
free
surrender
of
those
to
whom
it
belonged
xv
unless
there
is
an
express
stipulation
to
the
contrary
it
is
understood
that
in
all
treaties
of
peace
there
is
an
implied
assent
that
no
actions
are
to
be
brought
for
losses
occasioned
by
the
accidental
calamities
of
war
either
to
states
or
individuals
for
those
are
natural
consequences
of
a
state
of
hostilities
and
it
is
supposed
that
in
doubtful
cases
no
belligerent
would
consent
to
be
convicted
of
injustice
xvi
the
debts
owing
to
individuals
at
the
beginning
of
a
war
are
not
to
be
thought
thereby
discharged
for
they
are
not
things
acquired
by
the
laws
of
war
for
war
only
prevents
the
claim
to
them
from
being
prosecuted
but
by
no
means
releases
the
obligation
so
that
when
the
impediment
of
war
is
removed
such
debts
retain
their
original
force
for
though
it
ought
not
to
be
presumed
that
any
one
should
easily
be
deprived
of
a
right
subsisting
before
the
war
yet
this
is
to
be
understood
of
the
rights
arising
out
of
the
foundation
of
property
whereby
a
community
and
equality
of
goods
was
abolished
for
states
and
governments
says
cicero
were
originally
and
principally
designed
to
preserve
to
every
one
the
possession
of
his
own
property
xvii
the
right
to
claim
lands
or
goods
of
any
kind
by
way
of
punishment
is
not
of
equal
force
with
the
above
rules
for
in
transactions
and
treaties
of
that
kind
between
kings
and
sovereign
states
all
claims
of
that
kind
seem
and
indeed
ought
to
be
relinquished
otherwise
peace
would
be
no
peace
if
the
old
and
original
causes
of
the
war
were
allowed
to
remain
and
be
revived
and
the
most
latent
and
remote
causes
are
supposed
to
be
included
in
the
most
general
terms
in
treaties
of
peace
whereby
they
are
sunk
in
oblivion
xviii
the
rights
of
individuals
to
penalties
are
not
supposed
to
be
abandoned
resting
entirely
upon
different
grounds
because
they
may
be
decided
by
legal
tribunals
without
appealing
to
the
sword
yet
as
our
rights
of
this
sort
are
not
of
the
same
kind
with
those
of
absolute
property
and
as
penalties
have
always
something
odious
in
their
nature
any
faint
verbal
conjecture
will
be
thought
a
sufficient
presumption
of
their
being
remitted
xix
the
objection
made
against
taking
away
any
rights
that
existed
before
the
war
applies
chiefly
to
the
rights
of
individuals
for
where
the
words
of
a
treaty
supply
any
probable
conjecture
it
is
most
natural
to
suppose
that
kings
and
nations
have
more
readily
relinquished
certain
rights
especially
in
matters
where
those
rights
are
not
clearly
and
fully
ascertained
so
that
giving
the
most
favourable
construction
to
their
conduct
they
are
supposed
to
have
been
animated
with
the
noble
desire
of
rooting
up
and
destroying
all
the
seeds
of
war
xx
all
captures
made
after
a
treaty
is
finished
must
evidently
be
restored
for
the
treaty
puts
an
end
to
all
the
rights
of
war
xxi
but
in
treaties
relating
to
the
restoration
of
things
taken
in
war
a
more
extensive
interpretation
must
be
given
where
the
advantages
are
mutual
than
where
they
incline
only
to
one
side
in
the
next
place
all
the
parts
of
a
treaty
relating
to
persons
are
to
be
interpreted
more
favourably
than
those
relating
to
things
and
among
those
relating
to
things
priority
is
given
to
lands
before
moveable
effects
and
also
among
these
such
as
are
in
the
hands
of
the
state
are
held
in
more
consideration
than
the
possessions
of
individuals
and
again
among
things
in
the
possession
of
individuals
those
are
more
favoured
which
are
held
under
a
beneficial
title
than
those
which
are
loaded
with
incumbrances
as
things
held
by
money
payments
or
by
dower
xxii
the
person
to
whom
any
thing
is
ceded
by
a
treaty
of
peace
is
entitled
to
the
produce
and
fruits
of
it
from
the
time
of
such
cession
and
not
farther
back
a
point
maintained
by
augustus
caesar
in
opposition
to
sextus
pompey
who
upon
peloponnesus
being
ceded
to
him
claimed
also
the
tributes
and
revenues
that
were
due
for
former
years
xxiii
the
names
of
countries
are
to
be
taken
according
to
the
usage
of
the
present
time
not
so
much
according
to
the
popular
acceptation
as
to
that
of
men
of
science
by
whom
those
subjects
are
generally
treated
of
xxiv
these
rules
also
are
of
frequent
use
whenever
there
is
a
reference
to
an
antecedent
or
to
an
ancient
treaty
for
in
that
case
the
qualities
and
conditions
of
the
latter
treaty
are
considered
as
a
repetition
of
those
expressed
in
the
and
the
person
contracting
is
to
be
considered
as
having
really
performed
his
part
of
the
engagement
which
he
certainly
would
have
done
had
he
not
been
prevented
by
the
party
with
whom
he
is
engaged
in
dispute
xxv
what
some
allege
in
excuse
for
a
short
delay
in
the
execution
of
a
treaty
is
not
to
be
admitted
as
true
except
some
unforeseen
necessity
has
occasioned
the
impediment
for
though
some
of
the
may
favour
such
a
plea
that
is
not
surprising
considering
they
are
framed
solely
with
the
view
of
promoting
charity
among
christians
but
in
this
question
relating
to
the
interpretation
of
treaties
it
is
not
so
much
our
business
to
lay
down
what
is
best
and
properest
for
every
one
to
do
nor
even
to
state
what
religion
and
piety
require
as
to
consider
what
every
one
may
be
compelled
by
legal
authority
to
do
xxvi
in
doubtful
matters
it
is
usual
for
an
interpretation
to
be
given
more
prejudicial
to
the
party
who
has
dictated
the
terms
than
to
the
other
because
in
general
he
is
the
more
powerful
in
the
same
manner
in
explaining
the
terms
of
a
bargain
a
construction
is
generally
given
against
the
seller
as
he
may
blame
himself
for
not
having
spoken
more
clearly
and
openly
whereas
the
other
comprehending
the
terms
in
more
meanings
than
one
might
fairly
select
that
most
favourable
to
himself
xxvii
it
is
a
matter
of
frequent
dispute
what
constitutes
the
breach
of
a
peace
for
it
is
not
the
same
thing
to
break
a
peace
as
to
furnish
new
grounds
and
causes
of
war
there
is
a
great
difference
between
these
things
both
as
to
the
penalty
incurred
by
the
aggressor
and
as
to
the
aggrieved
party
being
in
other
respects
released
from
his
engagements
there
are
three
ways
in
which
a
peace
may
be
broken
either
by
doing
something
contrary
to
the
very
essence
of
all
peace
or
something
in
violation
of
the
express
terms
of
a
particular
peace
or
something
contrary
to
the
effects
which
are
intended
to
arise
from
every
peace
xxviii
a
thing
is
done
contrary
to
the
very
essence
of
all
peace
when
hostile
aggressions
are
committed
without
any
new
grounds
of
war
but
where
any
specious
pretext
can
be
assigned
for
taking
arms
it
is
better
it
should
be
supposed
purely
an
act
of
injustice
than
an
act
of
injustice
accompanied
with
perfidy
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
quote
the
words
of
thucydides
who
says
it
is
not
the
party
who
repels
force
by
arms
but
the
power
who
first
makes
the
attack
that
violates
a
peace
having
laid
down
these
rules
it
remains
to
be
considered
who
are
the
aggressors
and
who
are
the
aggrieved
persons
in
the
breaking
of
a
peace
xxix
there
are
some
who
think
that
a
peace
is
broken
when
even
those
who
have
been
allies
do
any
of
these
things
nor
indeed
can
it
be
denied
that
such
an
agreement
may
be
made
for
one
ally
to
become
liable
to
punishment
for
the
actions
of
another
and
for
a
peace
to
be
deemed
ratified
and
permanent
only
upon
conditions
partly
arbitrary
and
partly
casual
but
it
is
hardly
credible
unless
there
is
the
clearest
evidence
of
it
that
peace
is
ever
concluded
upon
such
terms
for
it
is
contrary
to
all
rule
and
repugnant
to
the
common
wishes
of
those
who
make
peace
therefore
those
who
have
committed
hostile
aggressions
without
the
assistance
of
others
will
be
deemed
breakers
of
the
peace
against
whom
alone
the
injured
party
will
have
a
right
to
take
arms
xxx
if
subjects
have
committed
any
act
of
hostility
without
authority
and
commission
from
the
state
it
will
form
a
proper
subject
of
inquiry
whether
the
state
can
be
judged
responsible
for
the
acts
of
individuals
to
constitute
which
responsibility
it
is
evident
that
a
knowledge
of
the
fact
power
to
punish
it
and
having
neglected
to
do
so
are
requisite
a
formal
notice
given
to
the
sovereign
of
the
offending
subjects
is
supposed
to
amount
to
a
knowledge
of
the
fact
and
it
is
presumed
that
every
sovereign
is
able
to
controul
and
punish
his
own
subjects
unless
there
be
some
defect
in
his
authority
and
a
lapse
of
time
beyond
what
is
usually
taken
for
the
punishment
of
civil
offences
in
every
country
may
be
construed
into
wilful
neglect
and
such
neglect
amounts
to
a
sanction
of
the
offence
xxxi
it
is
likewise
frequently
made
a
subject
of
inquiry
whether
a
state
is
answerable
for
the
conduct
of
any
of
her
people
who
do
not
take
arms
by
her
authority
but
serve
in
the
armies
of
some
other
power
engaged
in
war
the
cerites
in
livy
clear
themselves
upon
this
principle
that
it
was
not
by
their
authority
their
people
bore
arms
and
it
is
a
opinion
that
no
such
permission
ought
to
be
deemed
as
given
unless
it
appear
from
probable
reasons
that
it
was
intended
it
should
be
granted
a
thing
sometimes
done
according
to
the
example
of
the
ancient
aetolians
who
thought
they
had
a
right
to
deprive
every
plunderer
of
his
spoils
a
custom
the
force
of
which
polybius
expresses
in
the
following
words
when
other
powers
friends
and
allies
of
the
aetolians
are
at
war
with
each
other
the
aetolians
may
nevertheless
serve
in
the
armies
on
either
side
destroying
and
spoiling
their
respective
countries
xxxii
again
a
peace
ought
to
be
deemed
broken
not
only
by
any
act
of
violence
done
to
the
body
politic
itself
but
to
any
of
the
subjects
without
new
grounds
of
war
for
peace
is
made
with
a
view
to
the
security
of
every
individual
subject
as
the
state
in
making
peace
acts
for
the
whole
and
for
all
its
parts
indeed
even
if
new
grounds
of
war
should
arise
every
one
may
during
the
continuance
of
peace
defend
himself
and
his
property
for
it
is
a
natural
right
to
repel
force
by
force
a
right
which
it
can
not
easily
be
supposed
that
those
who
are
upon
a
footing
of
equality
have
ever
renounced
but
to
practise
revenge
or
use
violence
in
recovering
things
taken
away
will
not
be
lawful
except
where
justice
is
denied
justice
may
admit
of
some
delay
but
the
other
method
demands
prompt
execution
and
therefore
should
not
be
undertaken
but
in
extreme
emergency
but
if
the
subjects
of
any
country
persist
in
a
course
of
uniform
crime
and
aggression
repugnant
to
all
natural
and
civil
law
in
defiance
of
the
authority
of
their
own
government
so
that
the
hand
of
justice
can
not
reach
them
it
will
be
lawful
for
any
one
to
deprive
them
of
their
spoils
and
to
exercise
upon
them
the
same
rigour
as
if
they
were
delivered
up
to
punishment
but
to
attack
other
innocent
persons
on
that
account
is
a
direct
violation
of
peace
xxxiii
any
act
of
violence
also
offered
to
allies
constitutes
a
breach
of
the
peace
but
they
must
be
such
allies
as
are
comprehended
in
the
treaty
the
same
rule
holds
good
even
if
the
allies
themselves
have
not
made
the
treaty
but
others
have
done
so
on
their
behalf
since
it
is
evident
that
those
allies
regarded
the
peace
as
ratified
and
valid
for
they
are
looked
upon
as
enemies
till
it
is
certain
they
have
consented
to
the
ratification
other
allies
or
connections
who
are
neither
subjects
nor
named
in
the
treaty
of
peace
form
a
distinct
class
to
whom
any
violence
done
can
not
be
construed
into
an
act
of
breaking
the
peace
yet
it
does
not
follow
that
war
may
not
be
undertaken
on
such
an
account
but
then
it
will
be
a
war
resting
entirely
upon
new
grounds
xxxiv
a
peace
is
broken
by
doing
any
thing
contrary
to
the
express
terms
of
it
and
by
this
is
likewise
meant
the
of
engagements
xxxv
nor
can
we
admit
of
any
distinction
between
articles
of
greater
or
minor
importance
for
all
the
articles
of
a
treaty
are
of
sufficient
magnitude
to
require
observance
though
christian
charity
may
overlook
the
breach
of
them
upon
due
acknowledgement
but
to
provide
greater
security
for
the
continuance
of
a
peace
proper
clauses
will
be
annexed
to
the
minor
articles
stating
that
any
thing
done
against
them
shall
not
be
deemed
an
infraction
of
the
treaty
or
that
mediation
shall
be
adopted
in
preference
to
having
recourse
to
arms
xxxvi
this
seems
to
have
been
plainly
done
in
treaties
where
any
special
penalty
was
annexed
a
treaty
indeed
may
be
made
upon
terms
allowing
the
injured
party
his
option
either
of
enacting
the
penalty
or
receding
from
his
engagement
but
the
nature
of
the
business
rather
requires
the
method
of
mediation
it
is
evident
and
proved
from
the
authority
of
history
that
one
of
the
parties
who
has
not
fulfilled
his
engagement
owing
to
the
neglect
of
the
other
to
do
so
is
by
no
means
guilty
of
breaking
the
peace
as
his
obligation
was
only
conditional
xxxvii
if
there
is
any
unavoidable
necessity
to
prevent
one
party
from
fulfilling
his
engagement
as
for
instance
if
a
thing
has
been
destroyed
or
carried
off
by
which
the
restoration
of
it
has
become
impossible
a
peace
shall
not
thereby
be
deemed
broken
the
continuance
of
it
not
depending
upon
casual
conditions
but
the
other
party
may
have
his
option
either
to
prefer
waiting
if
there
is
any
reason
to
hope
that
the
engagement
may
be
fulfilled
at
some
future
period
or
to
receive
an
equivalent
or
to
be
released
on
his
side
from
some
corresponding
article
of
the
treaty
xxxviii
it
is
honourable
and
laudable
to
maintain
a
peace
even
after
it
has
been
violated
by
the
other
party
as
scipio
did
after
the
many
treacherous
acts
of
the
carthaginians
for
no
one
can
release
himself
from
an
obligation
by
acting
contrary
to
his
engagements
and
though
it
may
be
further
said
that
the
peace
is
broken
by
such
an
act
yet
the
breach
ought
to
be
taken
in
favour
of
the
innocent
party
if
he
thinks
proper
to
avail
himself
of
it
xxxix
lastly
a
peace
is
broken
by
the
violation
of
any
special
and
express
clause
in
the
treaty
xl
in
the
same
manner
those
powers
who
commit
unfriendly
acts
are
guilty
of
breaking
that
peace
which
was
made
solely
upon
condition
of
amicable
relations
being
preserved
for
what
in
other
cases
the
duties
of
friendship
alone
would
require
must
here
be
performed
by
the
law
of
treaty
and
it
is
to
treaties
of
this
kind
that
many
points
may
be
referred
which
are
discussed
by
legal
writers
relating
to
injuries
done
without
force
of
arms
and
to
the
offences
of
insults
according
to
this
principle
tully
has
observed
that
any
offence
committed
after
a
reconciliation
is
not
to
be
imputed
to
neglect
but
to
wilful
violation
not
to
imprudence
but
to
treachery
but
here
it
is
necessary
if
possible
to
exclude
from
the
account
every
charge
of
an
odious
kind
so
that
an
injury
done
to
a
relation
or
subject
of
the
person
with
whom
a
treaty
of
peace
has
been
made
is
not
to
be
deemed
the
same
as
one
done
to
himself
unless
there
are
evident
proofs
that
through
them
an
attack
upon
him
was
intended
and
an
invasion
of
another
rights
is
often
to
be
ascribed
to
new
motives
of
rapacity
rather
than
to
those
of
treachery
atrocious
menaces
without
any
new
grounds
of
offence
are
repugnant
to
all
terms
of
amity
any
one
may
assume
this
threatening
posture
by
erecting
new
fortifications
in
his
territory
as
a
means
of
annoyance
rather
than
offence
by
raising
an
unusual
number
of
forces
when
it
is
evident
that
these
preparations
can
be
designed
against
no
one
but
the
power
with
whom
he
has
concluded
peace
xli
nor
is
it
contrary
to
the
relations
of
amity
to
receive
individual
subjects
who
wish
to
remove
from
the
dominions
of
one
power
to
those
of
another
for
that
is
not
only
a
principle
of
natural
liberty
but
favourable
to
the
general
intercourse
of
mankind
on
the
same
grounds
a
refuge
given
to
exiles
may
be
justified
but
it
is
not
lawful
to
receive
whole
towns
or
great
bodies
forming
an
integral
part
of
the
state
nor
is
it
more
allowable
to
receive
those
who
are
bound
to
the
service
of
their
own
state
by
oath
or
other
engagement
xlvi
there
are
two
kinds
of
arbitration
the
one
of
such
a
nature
that
it
must
be
obeyed
whether
the
decision
be
just
or
unjust
which
proculus
says
is
observed
when
after
a
compromise
recourse
is
had
to
arbitration
the
other
kind
of
arbitration
is
where
a
matter
ought
to
be
left
to
the
decision
of
a
person
in
whose
integrity
confidence
may
be
placed
of
which
celsus
has
given
us
an
example
in
his
answer
where
he
says
though
a
freedman
has
sworn
that
he
will
do
all
the
services
which
his
patron
may
adjudge
the
will
of
the
patron
ought
not
to
be
ratified
unless
his
determination
be
just
this
interpretation
of
an
oath
though
conformable
to
the
roman
laws
is
by
no
means
consistent
with
the
simplicity
of
language
considered
by
itself
for
the
justice
of
the
case
remains
the
same
in
whatever
way
an
arbiter
is
chosen
whether
it
be
to
reconcile
contending
parties
a
character
in
which
we
find
the
athenians
acting
between
the
rhodians
and
demetrius
or
to
make
an
absolute
decree
although
the
civil
law
may
decide
upon
the
conduct
of
such
arbiters
to
whom
a
compromise
is
referred
so
as
to
allow
of
an
appeal
from
their
decrees
or
of
complaints
against
their
injustice
this
can
never
take
place
between
kings
and
nations
for
here
there
is
no
superior
power
that
can
either
rivet
or
relax
the
bonds
of
an
engagement
the
decree
therefore
of
such
arbiters
must
be
final
and
without
appeal
xlvii
with
respect
to
the
office
of
an
arbiter
or
mediator
it
is
proper
to
inquire
whether
the
person
has
been
appointed
in
the
character
of
a
judge
or
with
powers
more
extensive
and
discretionary
than
legal
powers
aristotle
says
that
an
equitable
and
moderate
man
will
have
recourse
to
arbitration
rather
than
to
strict
law
adding
as
a
reason
because
an
arbitrator
may
consider
the
equity
of
the
case
whereas
a
judge
is
bound
by
the
letter
of
the
law
therefore
arbitration
was
introduced
to
give
equity
its
due
weight
equity
does
not
signify
in
this
place
as
it
does
elsewhere
that
part
of
justice
which
gives
a
strict
interpretation
of
the
general
expressions
of
the
law
according
to
the
intention
of
the
for
that
is
left
to
the
judge
but
it
includes
every
thing
which
it
is
more
proper
to
do
than
to
omit
even
beyond
what
is
required
by
the
express
rules
of
such
kind
of
arbitration
being
common
among
individuals
and
subjects
of
the
same
empire
it
is
recommended
by
paul
as
a
practice
peculiarly
proper
for
christians
yet
in
doubtful
cases
it
ought
not
to
be
presumed
that
such
extensive
powers
are
granted
for
where
there
is
any
obscurity
it
abridges
this
latitude
of
decision
and
especially
in
contested
matters
between
independent
sovereigns
who
having
no
common
judge
are
supposed
to
bind
the
mediators
and
arbitrators
whom
they
chuse
by
the
strictest
rules
of
law
xlviii
it
is
to
be
observed
that
arbitrators
chosen
by
nations
or
sovereign
princes
may
decide
upon
the
matter
in
dispute
but
not
confer
a
possession
which
is
a
matter
that
can
only
be
decided
by
established
rules
of
civil
law
for
by
the
law
of
nations
the
right
of
possession
follows
the
right
of
property
therefore
while
a
cause
is
pending
no
innovation
ought
to
be
made
both
to
prevent
partiality
and
prejudice
and
because
after
possession
has
been
given
recovery
is
difficult
livy
in
his
account
of
some
disputed
points
between
the
people
of
carthage
and
masinissa
says
the
ambassadors
did
not
change
the
right
of
possession
xlix
there
is
another
kind
of
arbitration
which
takes
place
when
any
one
makes
an
absolute
surrender
of
himself
and
all
his
rights
to
an
enemy
or
foreign
power
but
still
a
distinction
ought
to
be
made
even
here
between
the
bounds
of
right
and
wrong
limiting
the
submission
of
the
vanquished
on
the
one
hand
and
the
authority
of
the
conqueror
on
the
other
to
a
certain
degree
for
there
are
particular
duties
which
ought
to
be
observed
in
the
exercise
of
every
right
taking
the
right
of
the
conqueror
in
its
literal
meaning
and
full
extent
it
is
true
that
he
is
entitled
to
impose
any
terms
upon
the
conquered
who
is
now
placed
by
the
external
laws
of
war
in
a
situation
to
be
deprived
of
every
thing
even
personal
liberty
or
life
much
more
then
of
all
his
property
either
of
a
public
or
private
kind
the
first
object
of
a
conqueror
should
be
to
avoid
committing
any
act
of
injustice
or
using
any
rigour
except
the
demerits
and
atrocity
of
the
enemy
require
it
to
take
nothing
but
by
way
of
lawful
punishment
observing
these
bounds
as
far
as
security
allows
it
is
always
laudable
to
incline
to
moderation
and
clemency
sometimes
even
circumstances
may
require
such
a
line
of
conduct
and
the
best
conclusion
of
any
war
is
that
which
reconciles
all
contending
claims
by
a
fair
adjustment
and
a
general
amnesty
the
moderation
and
clemency
to
which
the
vanquished
appeal
are
by
no
means
an
abolition
but
only
a
mitigation
of
the
conqueror
absolute
right
li
there
are
conditional
surrenders
reserving
to
the
individuals
certain
personal
privileges
and
remains
of
their
property
and
to
the
state
certain
parts
of
its
constitution
lii
hostages
and
pledges
may
be
considered
as
an
appendage
to
treaties
and
some
of
those
hostages
are
a
voluntary
surrender
and
others
given
by
authority
of
the
state
as
a
security
for
the
sovereign
has
the
same
power
over
the
persons
and
actions
of
his
subjects
as
over
their
property
but
the
state
or
its
ruler
will
be
bound
to
recompense
individuals
or
their
relatives
for
any
inconveniences
they
may
sustain
liii
though
the
law
of
nations
may
in
its
literal
rigour
allow
of
putting
hostages
to
death
it
can
never
conscientiously
be
enforced
but
where
they
have
committed
crimes
deserving
of
capital
punishment
neither
can
they
be
made
slaves
indeed
the
law
of
nations
permits
them
to
leave
their
property
to
their
heirs
although
by
the
roman
law
provision
was
made
for
confiscating
it
to
the
state
liv
if
it
should
be
asked
whether
hostages
may
lawfully
make
their
escape
it
may
be
answered
in
the
negative
especially
if
at
first
or
afterwards
they
have
pledged
their
faith
to
remain
upon
condition
of
being
prisoners
at
large
but
it
does
not
appear
that
states
so
much
intended
to
impose
a
hardship
upon
their
subjects
by
forbidding
their
escape
as
to
give
the
enemy
security
for
the
performance
of
their
engagements
lv
the
obligation
of
hostages
is
of
an
odious
nature
as
being
unfriendly
to
personal
liberty
and
arising
from
the
act
of
another
therefore
a
strict
interpretation
must
be
given
to
such
engagements
so
that
hostages
delivered
on
one
account
can
not
be
detained
on
any
other
nor
for
any
contract
where
hostages
are
not
required
but
if
in
another
case
there
has
been
any
violation
of
good
faith
or
any
debt
contracted
hostages
may
be
detained
not
as
hostages
but
in
the
capacity
of
subjects
whom
the
law
of
nations
makes
liable
to
be
seized
and
detained
for
the
acts
of
their
sovereigns
to
guard
against
which
provision
may
be
made
by
additional
clauses
for
the
restoration
of
hostages
whenever
the
engagement
for
which
they
were
delivered
has
been
fulfilled
lvi
whoever
has
been
delivered
as
a
hostage
for
other
prisoners
or
for
the
redemption
of
other
hostages
will
naturally
be
released
upon
the
death
of
those
persons
for
by
death
the
right
of
the
pledge
is
extinguished
in
the
same
manner
as
by
the
ransom
of
a
prisoner
and
therefore
according
to
ulpian
as
a
personal
debt
is
confined
to
him
who
has
contracted
it
so
one
person
being
substituted
for
another
can
not
be
detained
any
longer
than
while
the
obligation
of
that
other
continues
lvii
the
decision
whether
hostages
can
be
detained
upon
the
death
of
the
sovereign
by
whom
they
were
delivered
must
depend
upon
the
nature
of
the
engagements
which
he
has
made
if
they
are
personal
they
continue
in
force
only
during
his
natural
life
but
if
they
are
what
are
called
real
or
more
permanent
treaties
they
pass
with
all
their
consequences
to
his
successors
for
accessory
articles
can
not
authorise
any
deviation
from
the
general
rule
of
interpreting
the
fundamental
and
principal
points
of
a
treaty
but
the
accessory
articles
themselves
ought
rather
to
be
explained
in
conformity
to
those
general
rules
lviii
a
cursory
observation
may
be
made
that
hostages
are
sometimes
considered
not
as
appendages
but
as
forming
the
principal
part
of
an
engagement
where
any
one
is
bound
not
for
himself
but
for
another
and
in
case
of
being
obliged
to
pay
damages
his
hostages
or
sureties
are
answerable
in
his
there
is
not
only
some
thing
of
harshness
but
even
injustice
in
the
opinion
that
hostages
may
be
bound
for
the
conduct
of
another
even
without
their
own
consent
lix
pledges
have
some
characteristics
in
common
with
hostages
and
some
peculiar
to
themselves
it
is
a
common
characteristic
of
both
to
be
detained
for
something
else
that
is
due
except
where
public
faith
is
given
and
provision
made
to
the
contrary
pledges
may
be
detained
with
greater
latitude
than
hostages
which
is
one
of
their
peculiar
characteristics
there
being
less
of
odium
in
the
former
case
than
in
the
latter
things
being
of
a
nature
more
proper
for
detention
than
persons
lx
no
time
can
bar
the
redemption
of
a
pledge
whenever
the
engagement
for
which
it
was
given
is
fulfilled
for
it
is
never
to
be
presumed
that
engagements
proceed
from
new
causes
when
old
and
known
causes
can
be
assigned
if
a
debtor
therefore
has
forborne
to
redeem
a
pledge
we
may
still
suppose
that
he
has
not
abandoned
his
original
engagement
unless
there
be
clear
proof
to
the
contrary
as
if
for
instance
though
desirous
of
redeeming
it
he
has
been
prevented
or
suffered
a
space
of
time
to
elapse
unnoticed
that
would
be
requisite
to
imply
his
consent

in

by
the

powers
to

which

and

call
the
intercourse

which
comprehend

are
conventions
by
which
even
during

hostilities
on

side
cease
for
a
time
during
the
continuance
of

for
as
cicero
says
in
his
eighth
philippic
between
peace
and
war
there
is
no
medium
by
war
is
meant
a
state
of
affairs
which
may
exist
even
while
its
operations
are
not
continued
therefore
as
gellius
has
said
a
peace
and
a
truce
are
not
the
same
for
the
war
still
continues
though
fighting
may
cease
so
that
any
agreement
deemed
valid
in
the
time
of
war
will
be
valid
also
during
a
truce
unless
it
evidently
appears
that
it
is
not
the
state
of
affairs
which
is
considered
but
the
commission
of
particular
acts
of
hostility
on
the
other
hand
any
thing
agreed
to
to
be
done
when
peace
shall
be
made
can
not
take
place
in
consequence
of
a
truce
there
is
no
uniform
and
invariable
period
fixed
for
the
continuance
of
a
truce
it
may
be
made
for
any
time
even
for
twenty
or
thirty
years
of
which
there
are
many
instances
in
ancient
history
a
truce
though
a
repose
from
war
does
not
amount
to
a
peace
therefore
historians
are
correct
in
saying
that
a
peace
has
often
been
refused
when
a
truce
has
been
granted
iii
after
a
truce
a
new
declaration
of
war
is
not
necessary
for
upon
the
removal
of
a
temporary
impediment
the
state
of
warfare
revives
in
full
force
which
has
only
been
lulled
asleep
but
not
extinguished
yet
we
read
in
livy
that
it
was
the
opinion
of
the
heralds
college
that
after
the
expiration
of
a
truce
war
ought
to
be
declared
but
the
ancient
romans
only
meant
to
shew
by
those
superfluous
precautions
how
much
they
loved
peace
and
upon
what
just
grounds
they
were
dragged
into
war
iv
the
time
generally
assigned
for
the
continuance
of
a
truce
is
either
some
uninterrupted
period
of
a
hundred
days
for
instance
or
a
space
limited
by
some
artificial
boundary
of
time
as
the
calends
of
march
in
the
former
case
the
calculation
is
to
be
made
according
to
the
natural
motion
of
time
whereas
all
civil
computations
depend
upon
the
laws
and
customs
of
each
country
in
the
other
case
it
is
generally
made
a
matter
of
doubt
whether
in
naming
any
particular
day
month
or
year
for
the
expiration
of
a
truce
that
particular
day
month
or
year
are
comprehended
in
the
term
of
the
truce
or
excluded
from
it
in
natural
things
there
are
two
kinds
of
boundaries
one
of
which
forms
an
inseparable
part
of
the
things
themselves
as
the
skin
does
of
the
body
and
the
other
only
adjoins
them
as
a
river
adjoins
the
land
which
it
bounds
or
washes
in
either
of
these
ways
voluntary
boundaries
may
be
appointed
but
it
seems
more
natural
for
a
boundary
to
be
taken
as
a
part
of
the
thing
itself
aristotle
defines
the
extremity
of
anything
to
be
its
boundary
a
meaning
to
which
general
custom
conforms
thus
if
any
one
has
said
that
a
thing
is
to
be
done
before
the
day
of
his
death
the
day
on
which
he
actually
dies
is
to
be
taken
into
the
account
as
forming
part
of
the
term
spurinna
had
apprised
caesar
of
his
danger
which
could
not
extend
beyond
the
ides
of
march
being
accosted
respecting
the
matter
on
the
very
day
he
said
the
ides
of
march
are
come
but
not
passed
such
an
interpretation
is
the
more
proper
where
the
prolongation
of
time
is
of
a
favourable
nature
as
it
is
in
truces
which
are
calculated
to
suspend
the
effusion
of
human
blood
the
day
from
which
any
measure
of
time
is
said
to
begin
can
not
be
taken
into
the
account
because
the
word
from
used
on
that
occasion
implies
separation
and
not
conjunction
it
is
to
be
observed
that
truces
and
engagements
of
that
kind
immediately
bind
the
contracting
parties
themselves
from
the
very
moment
they
are
concluded
but
the
subjects
on
either
side
are
only
bound
from
the
time
that
those
engagements
have
received
the
form
of
a
law
for
which
public
notice
and
the
regular
promulgation
are
necessary
upon
this
being
done
they
immediately
derive
their
authority
to
bind
the
subjects
but
if
notice
thereof
has
only
been
given
in
one
place
the
observance
of
them
can
not
be
enforced
through
the
whole
dominions
of
the
respective
sovereigns
at
one
moment
but
sufficient
time
must
be
allowed
for
the
due
promulgation
of
them
to
be
made
in
every
part
therefore
if
in
the
meantime
the
subjects
on
either
side
have
committed
an
infraction
of
the
truce
they
shall
be
exempt
from
punishment
but
the
contracting
parties
themselves
shall
be
obliged
to
repair
the
damages
vi
the
very
definition
of
a
truce
implies
what
actions
are
lawful
and
what
are
unlawful
during
the
continuance
of
it
all
acts
of
hostility
are
unlawful
either
against
the
persons
or
goods
of
an
enemy
for
every
act
of
violence
during
a
truce
is
contrary
to
the
law
of
nations
even
things
belonging
to
an
enemy
which
by
any
accident
have
fallen
into
our
hands
although
they
had
been
ours
before
must
be
restored
because
they
had
become
theirs
by
that
external
right
according
to
which
such
things
are
adjudged
and
this
is
what
paulus
the
lawyer
says
that
during
the
time
of
a
truce
the
law
of
postliminium
can
not
exist
because
to
constitute
the
law
of
postliminium
there
must
be
the
previous
right
of
making
captures
in
war
which
ceases
upon
the
making
of
a
truce
either
party
may
go
to
or
return
from
any
particular
place
but
without
any
warlike
apparatus
or
force
that
may
prove
a
means
of
annoyance
or
be
attended
with
any
danger
this
is
observed
by
servius
on
that
passage
of
virgil
where
the
poet
says
the
latins
mingled
with
their
foes
with
impunity
where
he
relates
also
that
upon
a
truce
being
made
between
porsenna
and
the
romans
during
a
siege
when
the
games
of
the
circus
were
celebrating
the
generals
of
the
enemy
entered
the
city
contented
in
the
lists
and
were
many
of
them
crowned
as
conquerors
vii
to
withdraw
farther
into
the
country
with
an
army
which
we
find
from
livy
that
philip
did
is
no
way
contrary
to
the
intention
and
principles
of
a
truce
neither
is
it
any
breach
of
it
to
repair
the
walls
of
a
place
or
to
raise
new
forces
unless
it
has
been
prohibited
by
special
agreement
viii
to
corrupt
an
enemy
garrisons
in
order
to
seize
upon
the
places
which
he
holds
is
undoubtedly
a
breach
of
the
spirit
and
letter
of
any
truce
for
no
such
advantage
can
justly
be
gained
but
by
the
laws
of
war
the
same
rule
is
to
be
laid
down
respecting
the
revolt
of
subjects
to
an
enemy
in
the
fourth
book
of
thucydides
brasidas
received
the
city
of
menda
that
revolted
from
the
athenians
to
the
lacedaemonians
during
a
truce
and
excused
his
conduct
upon
the
plea
of
the
athenians
having
done
the
same
either
of
the
belligerent
powers
may
take
possession
of
places
that
have
been
deserted
if
they
have
been
really
deserted
by
the
former
owner
with
the
intention
never
to
occupy
them
again
but
not
merely
because
they
have
been
left
unguarded
either
before
or
after
the
making
of
a
truce
for
the
former
owner
right
of
dominion
therein
still
remaining
renders
another
possession
of
them
unjust
which
is
a
complete
refutation
of
the
cavil
of
belisarius
against
the
goths
who
seized
upon
some
places
during
a
truce
under
pretext
of
their
being
left
without
garrisons
ix
it
is
made
a
subject
of
inquiry
whether
any
one
being
prevented
by
an
unforeseen
accident
from
making
his
retreat
and
being
taken
within
the
enemy
territories
at
the
expiration
of
a
truce
has
a
right
to
return
considering
the
external
law
of
nations
he
is
undoubtedly
upon
the
same
footing
as
one
who
having
gone
into
a
foreign
country
must
upon
the
sudden
breaking
out
of
war
be
detained
there
as
an
enemy
till
the
return
of
peace
nor
is
there
any
thing
contrary
to
strict
justice
in
this
as
the
goods
and
persons
of
enemies
are
bound
for
the
debt
of
the
state
and
may
be
seized
for
payment
nor
has
such
a
one
more
reason
to
complain
than
innumerable
other
innocent
persons
on
whose
heads
the
calamities
of
war
have
fallen
nor
is
there
occasion
to
refer
to
the
case
which
cicero
has
alleged
in
his
second
book
on
invention
of
a
ship
of
war
driven
by
the
violence
of
the
wind
into
a
port
where
by
law
it
was
liable
to
confiscation
for
in
the
former
case
the
unforeseen
accident
must
do
away
all
idea
of
punishment
and
in
the
latter
the
right
of
confiscation
must
be
suspended
for
a
time
yet
there
can
be
no
doubt
but
there
is
more
of
generosity
and
kindness
in
releasing
such
a
person
than
in
insisting
upon
the
right
of
detaining
him
x
the
express
nature
of
a
convention
renders
some
things
unlawful
during
a
truce
as
for
instance
if
it
is
granted
only
in
order
to
bury
the
dead
neither
party
will
have
a
right
to
depart
from
those
conditions
thus
if
a
siege
is
suspended
by
a
truce
and
nothing
more
than
such
a
suspension
is
thereby
granted
the
besieged
can
not
lawfully
avail
himself
of
it
to
convey
fresh
supplies
of
troops
and
stores
into
the
place
for
such
conventions
ought
not
to
prove
beneficial
to
one
party
to
the
prejudice
of
the
other
who
grants
them
sometimes
it
is
stipulated
that
no
one
shall
be
allowed
to
pass
to
and
fro
sometimes
the
prohibition
extends
to
persons
and
not
to
goods
in
which
case
if
any
one
in
protecting
his
goods
hurts
an
enemy
the
act
will
not
constitute
a
breach
of
the
truce
for
as
it
is
lawful
that
either
party
should
defend
his
property
an
accidental
circumstance
can
not
be
deemed
an
infringement
of
that
personal
security
which
was
the
principal
object
provided
for
by
the
truce
xi
if
the
faith
of
a
truce
is
broken
by
one
of
the
parties
the
other
who
is
thereby
injured
will
undoubtedly
have
a
right
to
renew
hostilities
without
any
formal
declaration
for
every
article
in
a
treaty
contains
an
implied
condition
of
mutual
observance
indeed
we
may
find
in
history
instances
of
those
who
have
adhered
to
a
truce
till
its
expiration
notwithstanding
a
breach
on
the
other
side
but
on
the
other
hand
there
are
numerous
instances
of
hostilities
commenced
against
those
who
have
broken
their
conventions
a
variation
which
proves
that
it
is
at
the
option
of
the
injured
party
to
use
or
not
to
use
his
right
of
renewing
war
upon
the
breach
of
a
truce
xii
it
is
evident
that
if
the
stipulated
penalty
is
demanded
of
the
aggressor
and
paid
by
him
the
other
party
can
no
longer
maintain
his
right
of
renewing
the
war
for
the
payment
of
the
penalty
restores
every
thing
to
its
original
footing
and
on
the
other
hand
a
renewal
of
hostilities
implies
an
intention
of
the
injured
party
to
abandon
the
penalty
since
he
has
had
his
option
xiii
a
truce
is
not
broken
by
the
acts
of
individuals
unless
they
are
sanctioned
by
the
authority
of
the
sovereign
which
is
generally
supposed
to
be
given
where
the
delinquents
are
neither
punished
nor
delivered
up
nor
restitution
is
made
of
goods
taken
away
xiv
the
rights
belonging
to
a
are
a
privilege
distinct
from
the
nature
of
a
truce
and
our
interpretation
of
them
must
be
guided
by
the
rules
laid
down
respecting
privileges
such
a
privilege
to
be
perfect
must
be
neither
injurious
to
a
third
person
nor
prejudicial
to
the
giver
therefore
in
explaining
the
terms
in
which
it
is
couched
a
greater
latitude
of
interpretation
may
be
allowed
especially
where
the
party
suing
for
it
receives
no
benefit
but
rather
confers
one
and
still
more
so
where
the
advantage
accruing
to
the
individual
from
thence
redounds
also
to
the
public
benefit
of
the
state
therefore
the
literal
interpretation
which
the
words
may
bear
ought
to
be
rejected
unless
otherwise
some
absurdity
would
follow
or
there
is
every
reason
to
suppose
that
such
a
literal
interpretation
is
most
conformable
to
the
will
and
intention
of
the
parties
concerned
in
the
same
manner
on
the
other
hand
a
greater
latitude
of
interpretation
may
be
allowed
in
order
to
avoid
the
same
apprehended
absurdity
or
to
comply
more
fully
with
the
most
urgent
and
forcible
conjectures
respecting
the
will
of
the
contracting
parties
xv
hence
we
may
infer
that
a
granted
to
soldiers
includes
not
only
those
of
an
intermediate
rank
but
the
highest
commanders
for
that
is
a
signification
strictly
and
properly
authorised
by
the
words
themselves
although
they
may
be
taken
in
a
more
limited
meaning
so
the
term
clergymen
includes
those
of
episcopal
as
well
as
those
of
inferior
rank
and
by
those
serving
on
board
a
fleet
we
mean
not
only
sailors
but
all
persons
found
there
who
have
taken
the
military
oath
xvi
where
a
free
passage
is
granted
liberty
to
return
is
evidently
implied
not
from
the
literal
force
of
the
expressions
themselves
but
to
avoid
the
absurdity
which
would
follow
the
grant
of
a
privilege
that
could
never
be
made
use
of
and
by
the
liberty
of
coming
and
going
is
meant
a
safe
passage
till
the
person
arrives
in
a
place
of
perfect
security
from
hence
the
good
faith
of
alexander
was
impeached
who
ordered
those
to
be
murdered
on
the
way
whom
he
had
allowed
to
depart
any
one
may
be
allowed
to
go
away
without
being
allowed
to
return
but
no
power
can
properly
refuse
admitting
any
one
to
whom
he
has
granted
leave
to
come
and
on
the
other
hand
his
admission
implies
such
a
leave
to
have
been
given
going
away
and
returning
are
indeed
very
different
nor
can
any
construction
of
language
give
them
the
same
meaning
if
there
be
any
mistake
although
it
may
confer
no
right
it
exempts
the
party
from
all
a
person
permitted
to
come
shall
only
come
once
but
not
a
second
time
unless
the
additional
mention
of
some
time
may
supply
room
to
think
otherwise

a

of

missions

not
expressly
named

generally
understood
to
be
included

where
it
would
be
improper
for
the
person
to
go
without
such
attendants

every
necessary
consequence

to
go
along
with
any
privilege
that
is
given
xviii

the

other

are

such
as
are
usually
taken
on

journey

the
name
of
attendants
expressed
in
a
granted
to
any
one
will
not
allow
him
to
extend
the
protection
of
it
to
men
of
atrocious
and
criminal
characters
such
as
pirates
robbers
and
deserters
and
the
country
of
the
attendants
being
named
shews
that
the
protection
can
not
extend
to
those
of
another
nation
xx
the
privileges
of
a
do
not
in
doubtful
cases
expire
upon
the
demise
of
the
sovereign
who
granted
it
according
to
what
was
said
in
a
former
part
of
this
treatise
on
the
nature
of
favours
granted
by
kings
and
sovereign
princes
xxi
it
has
often
been
a
disputed
point
what
is
meant
by
the
expression
used
in
a
that
it
shall
continue
during
the
pleasure
of
the
grantor
but
there
seems
most
reason
and
truth
in
the
opinion
of
those
who
maintain
that
the
privilege
shall
continue
till
the
grantor
make
some
new
declaration
of
his
will
to
the
contrary
because
in
doubtful
cases
a
favour
is
presumed
to
continue
till
the
right
which
it
conveys
is
accomplished
but
not
so
where
all
possibility
of
will
in
the
grantor
has
ceased
which
happens
by
his
death
for
upon
the
death
of
the
person
all
presumption
of
his
will
continuing
must
cease
as
an
accident
vanishes
when
the
substance
is
destroyed
xxii
the
privilege
of
a
protects
the
person
to
whom
it
is
given
even
beyond
the
territories
of
the
grantor
because
it
is
given
as
a
protection
against
the
rights
of
war
which
are
not
confined
to
his
territory
xxiii
the
redemption
of
prisoners
is
much
favoured
particularly
among
christian
states
to
whom
the
divine
law
peculiarly
recommends
it
as
a
kind

lactantius

so
that
after
explaining
the
nature
of
the
faith
pledged
by
sovereign
powers
to
each
other
it
will
be
proper
to
make
a
short
inquiry
into
the
nature
of
engagements
made
by
subordinate
authorities
whether
those
authorities
bear
a
near
approach
to
supreme
power
as
commanders
in
chief
or
are
removed
to
a
greater
distance
from
it
caesar
makes
the
following
distinction
between
them
observing
that
the
offices
of
commander
and
deputy
are
very
different
the
latter
being
obliged
to
act
according
to
prescribed
rules
and
the
former
having
unqualified
discretion
in
matters
of
the
highest
importance
ii
the
engagements
of
those
invested
with
such
subordinate
powers
are
to
be
considered
in
a
double
point
of
view
whether
they
are
binding
upon
the
sovereign
or
only
upon
themselves
the
former
of
these
points
has
been
already
settled
in
a
former
part
of
this
treatise
where
it
was
shewn
that
a
person
is
bound
by
the
measures
of
an
agent
whom
he
has
appointed
to
act
in
his
name
whether
his
intentions
have
been
expressly
named
or
are
only
to
be
gathered
from
the
nature
of
the
employment
for
whoever
gives
another
a
commission
gives
him
along
with
it
every
thing
in
his
power
that
is
necessary
to
the
execution
of
it
so
that
there
are
two
ways
in
which
persons
acting
with
subordinate
powers
may
bind
their
principals
by
their
conduct
and
that
is
by
doing
what
is
probably
thought
to
be
contained
in
their
commission
or
apart
from
that
by
acting
according
to
special
instructions
generally
known
at
least
to
those
with
whom
they
treat
iii
there
are
other
modes
too
in
which
a
sovereign
may
be
bound
by
the
previous
act
of
his
minister
but
not
in
such
a
manner
as
to
suppose
the
obligation
owes
its
existence
to
that
action
which
only
gives
occasion
to
its
fulfilment
and
there
are
two
ways
in
which
this
may
happen
either
by
the
consent
of
the
sovereign
or
by
the
very
nature
of
the
thing
itself
his
consent
appears
by
his
ratification
of
the
act
either
expressed
or
implied
and
that
is
where
a
sovereign
has
known
and
suffered
a
thing
to
be
done
which
can
be
accounted
for
upon
no
other
motive
but
that
of
approval
and
consent
the
very
nature
and
obligation
of
all
contracts
imply
that
one
party
is
not
to
gain
advantage
by
the
loss
of
another
or
if
advantage
is
expected
from
a
contract
the
contract
must
be
fulfilled
or
the
advantage
abandoned
and
in
this
sense
and
no
other
the
proverbial
expression
that
whatever
is
beneficial
is
valid
is
to
be
understood
on
the
other
hand
a
charge
of
injustice
may
fairly
be
brought
against
those
who
condemn
an
engagement
yet
retain
the
advantages
which
they
could
not
have
had
without
it
iv
it
is
necessary
to
repeat
an
observation
made
before
that
a
sovereign
who
has
given
a
commission
to
another
is
bound
by
the
conduct
of
that
person
even
though
he
may
have
acted
contrary
to
his
secret
instructions
provided
he
has
not
gone
beyond
the
limits
of
his
ostensible
and
public
commission
this
was
a
principle
of
equity
which
the
roman
praetor
observed
in
actions
brought
against
employers
for
the
conduct
of
their
agents
or
factors
an
employer
could
not
be
made
answerable
for
any
act
or
measure
of
his
factor
but
such
as
was
immediately
connected
with
the
business
in
which
he
employed
him
nor
could
he
be
considered
as
an
appointed
agent
with
whom
the
public
were
apprised
by
due
notice
to
make
no
contract
if
such
notice
was
given
without
having
come
to
the
knowledge
of
the
contracting
parties
the
employer
was
bound
by
the
conduct
of
the
agent
if
any
one
chuses
to
make
a
contract
on
certain
conditions
or
through
the
intervention
of
a
third
person
it
is
right
and
necessary
for
that
person
to
observe
the
particular
conditions
on
which
he
is
employed
from
hence
it
follows
that
kings
and
nations
are
more
or
less
bound
by
the
conventions
of
their
commanders
in
proportion
as
their
laws
conditions
and
customs
are
more
or
less
known
if
the
meaning
of
their
intentions
is
not
evident
conjecture
may
supply
the
place
of
evidence
as
it
is
natural
to
suppose
that
any
one
employed
would
be
invested
with
full
powers
sufficient
to
execute
his
commission
a
person
acting
in
a
subordinate
capacity
if
he
has
exceeded
the
powers
of
his
commission
will
be
bound
to
make
reparation
if
he
can
not
fulfil
his
engagement
unless
he
is
prevented
from
doing
so
by
some
well
known
law
but
if
he
has
been
guilty
of
treachery
also
in
pretending
to
greater
powers
than
he
really
possessed
he
will
be
bound
to
repair
the
injury
which
he
has
wilfully
done
and
to
suffer
punishment
corresponding
with
his
offence
for
the
first
of
these
offences
his
property
is
answerable
and
on
failure
of
that
his
personal
liberty
and
in
the
latter
case
his
person
or
property
or
both
must
be
answerable
according
to
the
magnitude
of
the
crime
as
a
sovereign
or
his
minister
is
always
bound
by
every
contract
it
is
certain
the
other
party
will
also
be
bound
by
the
engagement
nor
can
it
be
deemed
imperfect
for
in
this
respect
there
is
a
comparative
equality
between
sovereign
and
subordinate
powers
vi
it
is
necessary
to
consider
too
what
are
the
powers
of
subordinate
authorities
over
those
beneath
them
nor
is
there
any
doubt
that
a
general
may
bind
the
army
and
a
magistrate
the
inhabitants
of
a
place
by
those
actions
which
are
usually
done
by
commanders
or
magistrates
otherwise
their
consent
would
be
necessary
on
the
other
hand
in
engagements
purely
beneficial
the
advantage
shall
be
on
the
side
of
the
inferior
for
that
is
a
condition
comprehended
in
the
very
nature
of
where
there
is
any
burdensome
condition
annexed
it
shall
not
extend
beyond
the
usual
limits
in
which
authority
is
exercised
or
if
it
does
it
shall
be
at
the
option
of
the
inferior
to
accept
or
refuse
that
condition
vii
as
to
the
causes
and
consequences
of
a
war
it
is
not
within
the
province
of
a
general
to
decide
them
for
concluding
and
conducting
a
war
are
very
different
things
and
rest
upon
distinct
kinds
of
authority
viii
and
ix
as
to
granting
truces
it
is
a
power
which
belongs
not
only
to
commanders
in
chief
but
also
to
inferior
commanders
and
they
may
grant
them
for
themselves
and
the
forces
immediately
under
their
command
to
places
which
they
are
besieging
or
blockading
but
they
do
not
thereby
bind
other
parts
of
the
army
generals
have
no
right
to
cede
nations
dominions
or
any
kind
of
conquests
made
in
war
they
may
relinquish
any
thing
of
which
a
complete
conquest
has
not
been
made
for
towns
frequently
surrender
on
condition
of
the
inhabitants
being
spared
and
allowed
to
retain
their
liberty
and
property
cases
in
which
there
is
no
time
for
consulting
the
will
and
pleasure
of
the
sovereign
in
the
same
manner
and
upon
the
same
principle
this
right
is
allowed
to
subordinate
commanders
if
it
falls
within
the
nature
of
their
commission
x
as
commanders
in
all
such
engagements
are
acting
in
the
name
of
others
their
resolutions
must
not
be
interpreted
so
strictly
as
to
bind
their
sovereigns
to
greater
obligations
than
they
intended
to
incur
nor
at
the
same
time
to
prove
prejudicial
to
the
commanders
themselves
for
having
done
their
duty
xi
an
absolute
surrender
implies
that
the
party
so
capitulating
submits
to
the
pleasure
and
discretion
of
the
conqueror
xii
in
ancient
conventions
a
precaution
was
usually
added
that
they
would
be
ratified
if
approved
of
by
the
roman
people
so
that
if
no
ratification
ensued
the
general
was
bound
no
further
than
to
be
answerable
for
any
advantage
that
might
have
accrued
to
himself

for

party
seeking
it

interest
thereby
provided
he
uses
no

meaning
of
mute
signs
allowed
by
custom
i
both
public
private
and
mixed
conventions
admit
of
tacit
consent
which
is
allowed
by
custom
for
in
whatever
manner
consent
is
indicated
and
accepted
it
has
the
power
of
conveying
a
right
and
as
it
has
been
frequently
observed
in
the
course
of
this
treatise
there
are
other
signs
of
consent
besides
words
and
letters
some
of
them
indeed
naturally
rising
out
of
the
action
itself
ii
an
example
of
such
tacit
agreement
may
be
found
in
the
case
of
a
person
coming
from
an
enemy
or
foreign
country
and
surrendering
himself
to
the
good
faith
of
another
king
or
people
for
such
a
one
tacitly
binds
himself
to
do
nothing
injurious
or
treacherous
to
that
state
where
he
seeks
protection
a
point
which
is
beyond
all
doubt
iii
in
the
same
manner
a
person
who
grants
or
requests
a
conference
gives
a
tacit
promise
that
he
will
do
nothing
prejudicial
to
the
parties
who
attend
it
livy
pronounces
an
injury
done
to
an
enemy
under
the
pretext
of
holding
a
conference
a
violation
of
the
law
of
nations
iv
but
such
a
tacit
promise
to
take
no
advantage
of
a
parley
or
conference
is
not
to
be
carried
farther
than
what
has
been
said
provided
all
injury
and
injustice
are
avoided
it
is
reckoned
a
lawful
stratagem
for
any
one
to
avail
himself
of
a
parley
in
order
to
draw
off
the
enemy
attention
from
his
military
projects
and
to
promote
his
own
the
device
by
which
asdrubal
extricated
his
army
from
the
ausetanian
forests
was
of
this
kind
and
by
the
same
means
scipio
africanus
the
elder
gained
a
perfect
knowledge
of
syphax
camp
both
these
circumstances
are
related
by
livy
there
are
certain
mute
signs
deriving
all
their
force
and
meaning
from
custom
such
as
the
fillets
and
branches
of
olive
formerly
used
among
the
macedonians
pikes
erected
and
among
the
romans
shields
placed
upon
the
head
were
signs
of
a
suppliant
surrender
obliging
the
party
to
lay
down
his
arms
in
the
present
day
a
white
flag
is
a
sign
of
suing
for
a
parley
therefore
all
these
methods
have
the
force
of
express
declarations

conclusion
of

work
i
here
seems
to
be
the
proper
place
to
bring
this
work
to
a
conclusion
without
in
the
least
presuming
that
every
thing
has
been
said
which
might
be
said
on
the
subject
but
sufficient
has
been
produced
to
lay
a
foundation
on
which
another
if
he
pleases
may
raise
a
more
noble
and
extensive
edifice
an
addition
and
improvement
that
will
provoke
no
jealousy
but
rather
be
entitled
to
thanks
before
entirely
dismissing
the
subject
it
may
be
necessary
to
observe
that
as
in
laying
down
the
true
motives
and
causes
that
alone
will
justify
war
every
possible
precaution
at
the
same
time
was
taken
to
state
the
reasons
for
which
it
should
be
avoided
so
now
a
few
admonitions
will
not
be
deemed
superfluous
in
order
to
point
out
the
means
of
preserving
good
faith
in
war
and
maintaining
peace
after
war
is
brought
to
a
termination
and
among
other
reasons
for
preserving
good
faith
the
desire
of
keeping
alive
the
hope
of
peace
even
in
the
midst
of
war
is
not
the
least
important
for
good
faith
in
the
language
of
cicero
is
not
only
the
principal
hold
by
which
all
governments
are
bound
together
but
is
the
by
which
the
larger
society
of
nations
is
united
destroy
this
says
aristotle
and
you
destroy
the
intercourse
of
mankind
in
every
other
branch
of
justice
there
is
something
of
obscurity
but
the
bond
of
faith
is
clear
in
itself
and
is
used
indeed
to
do
away
the
obscurity
of
all
transactions
the
observance
of
this
is
a
matter
of
conscience
with
all
lawful
kings
and
sovereign
princes
and
is
the
basis
of
that
reputation
by
which
the
honour
and
dignity
of
their
crowns
are
maintained
with
foreign
nations
ii
in
the
very
heat
of
war
the
greatest
security
and
expectation
of
divine
support
must
be
in
the
unabated
desire
and
invariable
prospect
of
peace
as
the
only
end
for
which
hostilities
can
be
lawfully
begun
so
that
in
the
prosecution
of
war
we
must
never
carry
the
rage
of
it
so
far
as
to
unlearn
the
nature
and
dispositions
of
men
iii
these
and
these
alone
would
be
sufficient
motives
for
the
termination
of
war
and
the
cultivation
of
peace
but
apart
from
all
considerations
of
humanity
the
interests
of
mankind
would
inevitably
lead
us
to
the
same
point
in
the
first
place
it
is
dangerous
to
prolong
a
contest
with
a
more
powerful
enemy
in
such
a
case
some
sacrifices
should
be
made
for
the
sake
of
peace
as
in
a
storm
goods
are
sometimes
thrown
overboard
to
prevent
a
greater
calamity
and
to
save
the
vessel
and
the
crew
iv
even
for
the
stronger
party
when
flushed
with
victory
peace
is
a
safer
expedient
than
the
most
extensive
successes
for
there
is
the
boldness
of
despair
to
be
apprehended
from
a
vanquished
enemy
dangerous
as
the
bite
of
a
ferocious
animal
in
the
pangs
of
death
if
indeed
both
parties
are
upon
an
equal
footing
it
is
the
opinion
of
caesar
that
it
is
the
most
favourable
moment
for
making
peace
when
each
party
has
confidence
in
itself
vi
on
whatever
terms
peace
is
made
it
must
be
absolutely
kept
from
the
sacredness
of
the
faith
pledged
in
the
engagement
and
every
thing
must
be
cautiously
avoided
not
only
savouring
of
treachery
but
that
may
tend
to
awaken
and
inflame
animosity
for
what
cicero
has
said
of
private
friendships
may
with
equal
propriety
be
applied
to
public
engagements
of
this
kind
which
are
all
to
be
religiously
and
faithfully
observed
especially
where
war
and
enmity
have
ended
in
peace
and
reconciliation
vii
and
may
god
to
whom
alone
it
belongs
to
dispose
the
affections
and
desires
of
sovereign
princes
and
kings
inscribe
these
principles
upon
their
hearts
and
minds
that
they
may
always
remember
that
the
noblest
office

the

that

to
explain

recourse

thus
the

authorizing

can

the
law
of
england
on
homicide
excusable
by
will
throw
light
on
the
sentiments
of
grotius
in
this
place
the
law
requires
that
the
person
who
kills
another
in
his
own
defence
should
have
retreated
as
far
as
he
conveniently
or
safely
can
to
avoid
the
violence
of
the
assault
before
he
turns
upon
his
assailant
and
that
not
fictitiously
or
in
order
to
watch
his
opportunity
but
from
a
real
tenderness
of
shedding
his
brother
blood
and
though
it
may
be
cowardice
in
time
of
war
between
two
independent
nations
to
flee
from
our
enemy
yet
between
two
fellow
subjects
the
law
countenances
no
such
point
of
honour
because
the
king
and
his
courts
are
the
and
will
give
to
the
party
wronged
all
the
satisfaction
he
deserves

himself
stating
it
to
be
only
a
repetition
and
enlargement
of
his
arguments
immediately
preceding
it
translator
grotius
does
not
vouch
for
the
truth
of
this
assertion
but
only
quotes
the
passage
to
shew
there
were
christians
in
the
army
of
marcus
aurelius
by
the
silanian
decree
of
the
senate
it
was
ordered
that
if
a
master
happened
to
be
murdered
in
his
own
house
all
the
slaves
under
the
same
roof
should
be
put
to
death
even
though
no
proof
appeared
of
their
being
concerned
in
the
murder
we
have
an
example
of
the
case
in
tacitus
annal
xiv
ch
xlii
the
emperor
adrian
softened
the
rigour
of
that
decree
by
ordering
that
only
they
should
be
exposed
to
the
rack
who
were
near
enough
to
have
heard
some
noise
spartian
life
of
adrian
ch
xviii
as
grotius
has
so
fully
established
his
argument
it
is
unnecessary
to
review
his
answer
to
further
translator
as
the
topics
of
the
third
section
have
been
so
fully
stated
in
the
second
chapter
that
section

been
omitted

the
translation

on
from
the
second
of
the
original
to
the
fourth
translator
in
case
of
rebellion
the
subjects
taken
in
arms
have
no
right
to
be
treated
as
prisoners
of
war
but
are
liable
to
punishment
as
criminals
wrongs
are
divisible
into
two
sorts
or
species
private
wrongs
and
public
wrongs
the
former
are
an
infringement
or
privation
of
the
private
or
civil
rights
belonging
to
individuals
considered
as
individuals
and
are
therefore
frequently
termed
civil
injuries
the
latter
are
a
breach
and
violation
of
public
rights
and
duties
which
affect
the
whole
community
considered
as
a
community
and
are
distinguished
by

the
translation
proceeds
from
hence
to

of

which
seems
to
follow

part
without
any
material
break
in
the
chain
of
argument

intermediate
sections
relating
to
instances
in
the
roman
republic
which
do
not
directly
apply

the
tenth
section
is
omitted
in
the
translation
as
the
subject
of
christian
forbearance
of
which
it
treats
has
already
been
discussed
in
the
preceeding
translator
sections
xiii
xiv

xv
of
the
original
are
omitted
in
the
translator
which
literally
signifies
certain
acts
may
be
rendered
by
the
term
incorporeal
rights
which
imply
the
right
of
ways
dignities
franchises
and
many
other
personal
privileges
arising
out
of
certain
corporeal
kinds
of
property
the
words
of
judge
blackstone
will
elucidate
the
meaning
of
grotius
in
this
place
the
learned
commentator
says
there
are
some
few
things
which
notwithstanding
the
general
introduction
and
continuance
of
property
must
still
unavoidably
remain
in
common
being
such
wherein
nothing
but
an
usufructuary
property
is
capable
of
being
had
and
therefore
they
still
belong
to
the
first
occupant
during
the
time
he
holds
possession
of
them
and
no
longer
such
among
others
are
the
elements
of
light
air
and
water
which
a
man
may
occupy
by
means
of
his
windows
his
gardens
his
mills
and
other
conveniences
such
also
are
the
generality
of
those
animals
which
are
said
to
be
or
of
a
wild
and
untameable
disposition
which
any
man
may
seise
upon
and
keep
for
his
own
use
or
pleasure
all
these
things
so
long
as
they
remain
in
possession
every
man
has
a
right
to
enjoy
without
disturbance
but
if
once
they
escape
from
his
custody
or
he
voluntarily
abandons
the
use
of
them
they
return
to
the
common
stock
and
any
man
else
has
a
right
to
seise
and
enjoy
them
afterwards
the
meaning
of
grotius
in
this
section
will
be
more
clearly
understood
by
a
brief
explanation
of
the
nature
of
contracts
now
contracts
are
of
two
kinds
either
express
or
implied
express
contracts
are
openly
uttered
and
avowed
at
the
time
of
making
as
to
deliver
an
ox
or
ten
load
of
timber
or
to
pay
a
stated
price
for
certain
goods
implied
are
such
as
reason
and
justice
dictate
and
which
therefore
the
law
presumes
that
every
man
undertakes
to
perform
as
if
i
employ
a
person
to
do
any
business
for
me
or
perform
any
work
the
law
implies
that
i
undertook
or
contracted
to
pay
him
as
much
as
his
labor
deserves
if
i
take
up
wares
from
a
tradesman
without
any
agreement
of
price
the
law
concludes
that
i
contracted
to
pay
their
real
value
and
there
is
also
one
species
of
implied
contracts
which
runs
through
and
is
annexed
to
all
other
contracts
conditions
and
covenants
viz
that
if
i
fail
in
my
part
of
the
agreement
i
shall
pay
the
other
party
such
damages
as
he
has
sustained
by
such
my
neglect
or
refusal

there
are
cases
in
which
monopolies
and
the
exclusive
privileges
of
trading
companies
are
not
only
allowable
but
absolutely
necessary
for
there
are
commercial
enterprizes
that
can
not
be
carried
on
without
an
energy
that
requires
considerable
funds
which
surpass
the
ability
of
individuals
there
are
others
that
would
soon
become
ruinous
were
they
not
conducted
with
great
prudence
with
one
regular
spirit
and
according
to
well
supported
maxims
and
rules
these
branches
of
trade
can
not
be
indiscriminately
carried

by
individuals
companies
are
therefore
formed
under
the
authority
of
the
government
and
these
companies
can
not
subsist
without
an
exclusive
privilege
it
is
therefore
advantageous
to
the
nation
to
grant
them

companies

adam
smith
in

that

itself
by

either
to
permit
the
entry
of
certain
goods
from
one
foreign
country
which
it
prohibits
from
all
others
or
to
exempt
the
goods
of
one
country
from
duties
to
which
it
subjects
those
of
all
others
the
country
or
at
least
the
merchants
and
manufacturers
of
the
country
whose
commerce
is
so
favoured
must
necessarily
derive
great
advantages
from
the
treaty
those
merchants
and
manufacturers
enjoy
a
sort
of
monopoly
in
the
country
which
is
so
indulgent
to
them
that
country
becomes
a
market
both
more
extensive
and
more
advantageous
for
their
goods
more
extensive
because
the
goods
of
other
nations
being
either
excluded
or
subjected
to
heavier
duties
it
takes
off
a
great
quantity
of
theirs
more
advantageous
because
the
merchants
of
the
favoured
country
enjoying
a
sort
of

will
often

a

the

make
it
absolutely
the

any

of
discovering
the
true

of

by

the
following
passage
from
judge
blackstone
will
both
elucidate
the
meaning
and
support
the
reasoning
of
our
author
though
money
was
originally
used
only
for
the
purposes
of
exchange
yet
the
laws
of
any
state
may
be
well
justified
in
permitting
it
to
be
turned
to
the
purposes
of
profit
if
the
convenience
of
society
the
great
end
for
which
money
was
invented
shall
require
it
and
that
the
allowance
of
moderate
interest
tends
greatly
to
the
benefit
of
the
public
especially
in
a
trading
country
will
appear
from
that
generally
acknowledged
principle
that
commerce
can
not
subsist
without
mutual
and
extensive
credit
unless
money
therefore
can
be
borrowed
trade
can
not
be
carried
on
and
if
no
premium
were
allowed
for
the
hire
of
money
few
persons
would
care
to
lend
it
or
at
least
the
ease
of
borrowing
at
short
warning
which
is
the
life
of
commerce
would
be
entirely
at
an
b
ii
ch
the
mosaic
law
indeed
prohibited
the
lending
of
money
upon
usury
but
this
was
a
political
and
not
a
moral
precept
it
only
prohibited
the
jews
from
taking
usury
of
their
brethren
the
jews
but
in
express
words
permitted
them
to
take
it
of
a
stranger
which
proves
that
the
taking
of
moderate
usury
or
a
reward
for
the
use
is
not
an
evil
in
itself
since
it
was
allowed
where
any
but
an
israelite
was
blackst
com
ii
ch
the
objections
made
to
it
by
cicero
and
others
our
author
observes
are
founded
more
upon
the
consequences
of
usury
than
upon
usury
itself
because
it
deters
men
from
borrowing
but
on
the
other
hand
if
there
were
no
advantage
attached
to
the
lending
of
money
none
would
be
found
willing
to
lend
consequently
the
benefits
arising
from
a
facility
of
borrowing
money
to
carry
on
trade
would
be
defeated
insurances
being
contracts
the
very
essence
of
which
consists
in
observing
the
purest
good
faith
and
integrity
they
are
vacated
by
any
the
least
shadow
of
fraud
or
undue
concealment
and
on
the
other
hand
being
much
for
the
benefit
and
extension
of
trade
by
distributing
the
loss
or
gain
among
a
number
of
adventurers
they
are
greatly
encouraged
and
protected
both
by
common
law
and
acts
of
blackst
com
ii
ch
the
contract
of
insurance
is
founded
upon
the
purest
principles
of
morality
and
abstract
justice
hence
it
is
necessary
that
the
contracting
parties
should
have
perfectly
equal
knowledge
or
ignorance
of
every
material
circumstance
respecting
the
thing
insured
if
on
either
side
there
is
any
misrepresentation
or
or
concealment
or
which
would
in
any
degree
affect
the
premium
or
the
terms
of
the
engagement
the
contract
is
fraudulent

absolutely
void
christian
note
on
the
same
passage
there
is
a
distinction
to
be
observed
between
the
necessary
and
the
voluntary
law
of
nations
vattel
defines
the
necessary
law
to
be
that
which
is
always
obligatory
on
the
conscience
and
of
which
a
nation
ought
never
to
lose
sight
in
the
line
of
conduct
she
is
to
pursue
in
order
to
fulfil
her
duty
but
when
there
is
a
question
of
examining
what
she
may
demand
of
other
states
she
must
consult
the
voluntary
law
whose
maxims
are
devoted
to
the
safety
and
advantage
of
the
universal
society
of
prelim
sect
the
writer
quoted
in
the
preceding
note
defines
that
obligation
to
be
internal
which
binds
the
conscience
and
is
deduced
from
the
rules
of
duty
and
that
to
be
external
which
is
considered
relatively
to
other
men
and
produces
some
right
between
ibid
sect
a
treaty
may
be
more
advantageous
to
one
of
the
contracting
parties
than
to
the
other
and
yet
contain
nothing
unjust
frequently
a
great
monarch
wishing
to
engage
a
weaker
state
in
his
interest
offers
her
advantageous
conditions
promises
her
gratuitous
succours
or
greater
than
he
stipulates
for
himself
but
at
the
same
time
he
claims
a
superiority
of
dignity
and
requires
respect
from
his
ally
it
is
this
last
particular
which
renders
the
alliance
unequal
and
to
this
circumstance
we
must
attentively
advert
for
with
alliances
of
this
nature
we
are
not
to
confound
those
in
which
the
parties
treat
on
a
footing
of
equality
though
the
more
powerful
of
the
allies
for
particular
reasons
gives
more
than
he
receives
promises
his
assistance
gratis
without
requiring
gratuitous
assistance
in
his
turn
or
promises
more
considerable
succours
or
even
the
assistance
of
all
his
forces
here
the
alliance
is
equal
but
the
treaty
is
unequal
unless
indeed
we
may
be
allowed
to
say
that
as
the
party
who
makes
the
greater
concessions
has
a
greater
interest
in
concluding
the
treaty
this
consideration
restores
the
equality
thus
at
a
time
when
france
found
herself
embarrassed
in
a
momentous
war
with
the
house
of
austria
and
the
cardinal
de
richelieu
wished
to
humble
that
formidable
power
he
like
an
able
minister
concluded
a
treaty
with
gustavus
adolphus
in
which
all
the
advantage
appeared
to
be
on
the
side
of
sweden
from
a
bare
consideration
of
the
stipulations
of
that
treaty
it
would
have
been
pronounced
an
unequal
one
but
the
advantages
which
france
derived
from
it
amply
compensated
for
that
inequality

a

approves

the

can
not
be

within
general

occasional

therefore
become
requisite
which
vary
with
each
variation
of
circumstances
for
the
measure
of
what

indefinite
must
be
indefinite
itself

which

its

according

that
of

it
is
manifest
therefore
that
equity
is
a
species
of
justice
and
contrasted
with
another
species
to
which
it
is
preferable
a
man
of
equity
is
he
who
deliberately
and
habitually
exercises
this
virtue
who
prefers
it
in
all
his
dealings
to
the
rigour
of
justice
and
who
even

on

in

vary
their

if

it

there
shall

a

declaration
of

by

parties
pronounces
such
amicable

to
be
at

end
here
there
is
no
variation

principle

in
circumstances
which
render
such
a
dissolution
of
the

that
was

the
welfare
and
preservation
of
that
power
the
sole
object
of
all
treaties
to
illustrate
the
nature
of
general

particular
cases
the
following
example
is
taken
from
the
puffendorf
one
law
forbids
us
to
appear
in
public
with
arms
on
holidays
another
law
commands
us
to
turn
out
under
arms
and
repair
to
our
posts
as
soon
as
we
hear
the
sound
of
the
alarm
bell
the
alarm
is
rung
on
a
holiday
in
such
case
we
must
obey
the
latter
of
the
two
laws

the

ambassadors
as
they
are
not
sent
to
foreign

but
they
are
public

forms
a

contrast

ancient

then
the
personal

the

seem

have
lost

read
the
accounts
of

warfare
and
you
find
hostilities
commenced
not
from
private
animosity
but
from
some
great
and
national
object
in
the
prosecution
of
which
the
feelings

thus
letters

to
redress
their

issue

sovereign

that
here
the
action
would
be
unlawful
that
is
unjust
unless
performed
by
an
agent
who
had
a
commission
from
public
authority
the
three
rules
above
laid
down
by
our
author
may
be
illustrated
by
the
three
following
in
the
first
place
it
can
not
be
denied
that
war
in
the
abstract
is
an
evil
but
then
it
is
necessary
to
consider
whether
it
is
not
an
evil
that
must
in
many
cases
be
submitted
to
in
order
to
avoid
still
greater
calamities
secondly
in
the
prosecution
of
a
war
where
the
advantages
or
evils
are
doubtful
it
is
necessary
to
endeavour
after
the
attainment
of
new
confederacies
or
alliances
that
may
compensate
for
the
losses
sustained
or
may
open
out
new
channels
of
trade
and
commerce
which
may
supply
the
place
of
those
that
have
been
closed
by
the
immediate
war
as
an
illustration
of
the
third
point
we
may
adduce
the
conduct
of
king
william
after
the
british
cabinet
that
met
at
tunbridge
wells
august
represented
to
him
how
inadequate
the
spirit
of
the
nation
was
to
enter
into
a
new
war
and
to
bear
additional
burdens
concluding
this
is
the
truth
of
the
fact
upon
which
your
majesty
will
determine
what
resolution
ought
to
be
taken
his
majesty
did
determine
upon
war
as
the
least
of
all
the
evils
which
faced
his
people
notwithstanding
the
apparent
inadequacy
of
his
means
and
in
that
great
war
carried
on
against
louis
the
xiv
for
near
eighteen
years
government
spared
no
pains
to
satisfy
the
nation
that
though
they
were
to
be
animated
by
a
desire
of
glory
glory
was
not
their
ultimate
object
but
that
every
thing
dear
to
them
in
religion
in
law
in
liberty
every
thing
which
as
freemen
as
englishmen
and
as
citizens
of
the
great
commonwealth
of
christendom
they
had
at
heart
was
then
at
lett
on
regic
peace
thus
when
a
ship
makes
an
appearance
of
mounting
more
guns
than
she
really
carries
in
order
to
deter
an
enemy
from
attacking
her
this
may
be
considered
as
one
of
those
negative
stratagems
or
stratagems
of
dissimulation
to
which
our
author
alludes
besides
the
necessary
law
of
nations
which
is
equally
and
at
all
times
binding
upon
all
states
there
is
a
positive
law
of
nations
consisting
of
the
voluntary
the
conventional
and
the
customary
law
all
of
which
proceed
from
the
will
of
nations
the
voluntary
from
their
presumed
consent
the
conventional
from
an
express
consent
and
the
customary
from
tacit
consent
and
as
there
can
be
no
other
mode
of
deducing
any
law
from
the
will
of
nations
there
are
only
these
three
kinds
of
positive
law

here
speaks
of
things

the
end
