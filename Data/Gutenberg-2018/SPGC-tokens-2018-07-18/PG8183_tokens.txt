these

are
of
the

befell
gods
and
men
in

averon

zarkandhu
and

of

part
i
time
and
the
gods
once
when
the
gods
were
young
and
only
their
swarthy
servant
time
was
without
age
the
gods
lay
sleeping
by
a
broad
river
upon
earth
there
in
a
valley
that
from
all
the
earth
the
gods
had
set
apart
for
their
repose
the
gods
dreamed
marble
dreams
and
with
domes
and
pinnacles
the
dreams
arose
and
stood
up
proudly
between
the
river
and
the
sky
all
shimmering
white
to
the
morning
in
the
city
midst
the
gleaming
marble
of
a
thousand
steps
climbed
to
the
citadel
where
arose
four
pinnacles
beckoning
to
heaven
and
midmost
between
the
pinnacles
there
stood
the
dome
vast
as
the
gods
had
dreamed
it
all
around
terrace
by
terrace
there
went
marble
lawns
well
guarded
by
onyx
lions
and
carved
with
effigies
of
all
the
gods
striding
amid
the
symbols
of
the
worlds
with
a
sound
like
tinkling
bells
far
off
in
a
land
of
shepherds
hidden
by
some
hill
the
waters
of
many
fountains
turned
again
home
then
the
gods
awoke
and
there
stood
sardathrion
not
to
common
men
have
the
gods
given
to
walk
sardathrion
streets
and
not
to
common
eyes
to
see
her
fountains
only
to
those
to
whom
in
lonely
passes
in
the
night
the
gods
have
spoken
leaning
through
the
stars
to
those
that
have
heard
the
voices
of
the
gods
above
the
morning
or
seen
their
faces
bending
above
the
sea
only
to
those
hath
it
been
given
to
see
sardathrion
to
stand
where
her
pinnacles
gathered
together
in
the
night
fresh
from
the
dreams
of
gods
for
round
the
valley
a
great
desert
lies
through
which
no
common
traveller
may
come
but
those
whom
the
gods
have
chosen
feel
suddenly
a
great
longing
at
heart
and
crossing
the
mountains
that
divide
the
desert
from
the
world
set
out
across
it
driven
by
the
gods
till
hidden
in
the
desert
midst
they
find
the
valley
at
last
and
look
with
eyes
upon
sardathrion
in
the
desert
beyond
the
valley
grow
a
myriad
thorns
and
all
pointing
towards
sardathrion
so
may
many
that
the
gods
have
loved
come
to
the
marble
city
but
none
can
return
for
other
cities
are
no
fitting
home
for
men
whose
feet
have
touched
sardathrion
marble
streets
where
even
the
gods
have
not
been
ashamed
to
come
in
the
guise
of
men
with
their
cloaks
wrapped
about
their
faces
therefore
no
city
shall
ever
hear
the
songs
that
are
sung
in
the
marble
citadel
by
those
in
whose
ears
have
rung
the
voices
of
the
gods
no
report
shall
ever
come
to
other
lands
of
the
music
of
the
fall
of
sardathrion
fountains
when
the
waters
which
went
heavenward
return
again
into
the
lake
where
the
gods
cool
their
brows
sometimes
in
the
guise
of
men
none
may
ever
hear
the
speech
of
the
poets
of
that
city
to
whom
the
gods
have
spoken
it
stands
a
city
aloof
there
hath
been
no
rumour
of
it
i
alone
have
dreamed
of
it
and
i
may
not
be
sure
that
my
dreams
are
true
above
the
twilight
the
gods
were
seated
in
the
after
years
ruling
the
worlds
no
longer
now
they
walked
at
evening
in
the
marble
city
hearing
the
fountains
splash
or
listening
to
the
singing
of
the
men
they
loved
because
it
was
in
the
after
years
and
the
work
of
the
gods
was
to
be
done
but
often
as
they
rested
a
moment
from
doing
the
work
of
the
gods
from
hearing
the
prayers
of
men
or
sending
here
the
pestilence
or
there
mercy
they
would
speak
awhile
with
one
another
of
the
olden
years
saying
rememberest
thou
not
sardathrion
and
another
would
answer
ah
sardathrion
and
all
sardathrion
marble
lawns
whereon
we
walk
not
now
then
the
gods
turned
to
do
the
work
of
the
gods
answering
the
prayers
of
men
or
smiting
them
and
ever
they
sent
their
swarthy
servant
time
to
heal
or
overwhelm
and
time
went
forth
into
the
worlds
to
obey
the
commands
of
the
gods
yet
he
cast
furtive
glances
at
his
masters
and
the
gods
distrusted
time
because
he
had
known
the
worlds
or
ever
the
gods
became
one
day
when
furtive
time
had
gone
into
the
worlds
to
nimbly
smite
some
city
whereof
the
gods
were
weary
the
gods
above
the
twilight
speaking
to
one
another
said
surely
we
are
the
lords
of
time
and
gods
of
the
worlds
besides
see
how
our
city
sardathrion
lifts
over
other
cities
others
arise
and
perish
but
sardathrion
standeth
yet
the
first
and
the
last
of
cities
rivers
are
lost
in
the
sea
and
streams
forsake
the
hills
but
ever
sardathrion
fountains
arise
in
our
dream
city
as
was
sardathrion
when
the
gods
were
young
so
are
her
streets
as
a
sign
that
we
are
the
gods
suddenly
the
swart
figure
of
time
stood
up
before
the
gods
with
both
hands
dripping
with
blood
and
a
red
sword
dangling
idly
from
his
fingers
and
said
sardathrion
is
gone
i
have
overthrown
it
and
the
gods
said
sardathrion
sardathrion
the
marble
city
thou
thou
hast
overthrown
it
thou
the
slave
of
the
gods
and
the
oldest
of
the
gods
said
sardathrion
sardathrion
and
is
sardathrion
gone
and
furtively
time
looked
him
in
the
face
and
edged
towards
him
fingering
with
his
dripping
fingers
the
hilt
of
his
nimble
sword
then
the
gods
feared
with
a
new
fear
that
he
that
had
overthrown
their
city
would
one
day
slay
the
gods
and
a
new
cry
went
wailing
through
the
twilight
the
lament
of
the
gods
for
their
dream
city
crying
tears
may
not
bring
again
sardathrion
but
this
the
gods
may
do
who
have
seen
and
seen
with
unrelenting
eyes
the
sorrows
of
ten
thousand
worlds
thy
gods
may
weep
for
thee
tears
may
not
bring
again
sardathrion
believe
it
not
sardathrion
that
ever
thy
gods
sent
this
doom
to
thee
he
that
hath
overthrown
thee
shall
overthrow
thy
gods
how
oft
when
night
came
suddenly
on
morning
playing
in
the
fields
of
twilight
did
we
watch
thy
pinnacles
emerging
from
the
darkness
sardathrion
sardathrion
dream
city
of
the
gods
and
thine
onyx
lions
looming
limb
by
limb
from
the
dusk
how
often
have
we
sent
our
child
the
dawn
to
play
with
thy
fountain
tops
how
often
hath
evening
loveliest
of
our
goddesses
strayed
long
upon
thy
balconies
let
one
fragment
of
thy
marbles
stand
up
above
the
dust
for
thine
old
gods
to
caress
as
a
man
when
all
else
is
lost
treasures
one
lock
of
the
hair
of
his
beloved
sardathrion
the
gods
must
kiss
once
more
the
place
where
thy
streets
were
once
there
were
wonderful
marbles
in
thy
streets
sardathrion
sardathrion
sardathrion
the
gods
weep
for
thee
the
coming
of
the
sea
once
there
was
no
sea
and
the
gods
went
walking
over
the
green
plains
of
earth
upon
an
evening
of
the
forgotten
years
the
gods
were
seated
on
the
hills
and
all
the
little
rivers
of
the
world
lay
coiled
at
their
feet
asleep
when
slid
the
new
god
striding
through
the
stars
came
suddenly
upon
earth
lying
in
a
corner
of
space
and
behind
slid
there
marched
a
million
waves
all
following
slid
and
tramping
up
the
twilight
and
slid
touched
earth
in
one
of
her
great
green
valleys
that
divide
the
south
and
here
he
encamped
for
the
night
with
all
his
waves
about
him
but
to
the
gods
as
they
sat
upon
their
hilltops
a
new
cry
came
crying
over
the
green
spaces
that
lay
below
the
hills
and
the
gods
said
this
is
neither
the
cry
of
life
nor
yet
the
whisper
of
death
what
is
this
new
cry
that
the
gods
have
never
commanded
yet
which
comes
to
the
ears
of
the
gods
and
the
gods
together
shouting
made
the
cry
of
the
south
calling
the
south
wind
to
them
and
again
the
gods
shouted
all
together
making
the
cry
of
the
north
calling
the
north
wind
to
them
and
thus
they
gathered
to
them
all
their
winds
and
sent
these
four
down
into
the
low
plains
to
find
what
thing
it
was
that
called
with
the
new
cry
and
to
drive
it
away
from
the
gods
then
all
the
winds
harnessed
up
their
clouds
and
drave
forth
till
they
came
to
the
great
green
valley
that
divides
the
south
in
twain
and
there
found
slid
with
all
his
waves
about
him
then
for
a
space
slid
and
the
four
winds
struggled
with
one
another
till
the
strength
of
the
winds
was
gone
and
they
limped
back
to
the
gods
their
masters
and
said
we
have
met
this
new
thing
that
has
come
upon
the
earth
and
have
striven
against
its
armies
but
could
not
drive
them
forth
and
the
new
thing
is
beautiful
but
very
angry
and
is
creeping
towards
the
gods
but
slid
advanced
and
led
his
armies
up
the
valley
and
inch
by
inch
and
mile
by
mile
he
conquered
the
lands
of
the
gods
then
from
their
hills
the
gods
sent
down
a
great
array
of
cliffs
against
hard
red
rocks
and
bade
them
march
against
slid
and
the
cliffs
marched
down
till
they
came
and
stood
before
slid
and
leaned
their
heads
forward
and
frowned
and
stood
staunch
to
guard
the
lands
of
the
gods
against
the
might
of
the
sea
shutting
slid
off
from
the
world
then
slid
sent
some
of
his
smaller
waves
to
search
out
what
stood
against
him
and
the
cliffs
shattered
them
but
slid
went
back
and
gathered
together
a
hoard
of
his
greatest
waves
and
hurled
them
against
the
cliffs
and
the
cliffs
shattered
them
and
again
slid
called
up
out
of
his
deep
a
mighty
array
of
waves
and
sent
them
roaring
against
the
guardians
of
the
gods
and
the
red
rocks
frowned
and
smote
them
and
once
again
slid
gathered
his
greater
waves
and
hurled
them
against
the
cliffs
and
when
the
waves
were
scattered
like
those
before
them
the
feet
of
the
cliffs
were
no
longer
standing
firm
and
their
faces
were
scarred
and
battered
then
into
every
cleft
that
stood
in
the
rocks
slid
sent
his
hugest
wave
and
others
followed
behind
it
and
slid
himself
seized
hold
of
huge
rocks
with
his
claws
and
tore
them
down
and
stamped
them
under
his
feet
and
when
the
tumult
was
over
the
sea
had
won
and
over
the
broken
remnants
of
those
red
cliffs
the
armies
of
slid
marched
on
and
up
the
long
green
valley
then
the
gods
heard
slid
exulting
far
away
and
singing
songs
of
triumph
over
their
battered
cliffs
and
ever
the
tramp
of
his
armies
sounded
nearer
and
nearer
in
the
listening
ears
of
the
gods
then
the
gods
called
to
their
downlands
to
save
their
world
from
slid
and
the
downlands
gathered
themselves
and
marched
away
a
great
white
line
of
gleaming
cliffs
and
halted
before
slid
then
slid
advanced
no
more
and
lulled
his
legions
and
while
his
waves
were
low
he
softly
crooned
a
song
such
as
once
long
ago
had
troubled
the
stars
and
brought
down
tears
out
of
the
twilight
sternly
the
white
cliffs
stood
on
guard
to
save
the
world
of
the
gods
but
the
song
that
once
had
troubled
the
stars
went
moaning
on
awaking
pent
desires
till
full
at
the
feet
of
the
gods
the
melody
fell
then
the
blue
rivers
that
lay
curled
asleep
opened
their
gleaming
eyes
uncurled
themselves
and
shook
their
rushes
and
making
a
stir
among
the
hills
crept
down
to
find
the
sea
and
passing
across
the
world
they
came
at
last
to
where
the
white
cliffs
stood
and
coming
behind
them
split
them
here
and
there
and
went
through
their
broken
ranks
to
slid
at
last
and
the
gods
were
angry
with
their
traitorous
streams
then
slid
ceased
from
singing
the
song
that
lures
the
world
and
gathered
up
his
legions
and
the
rivers
lifted
up
their
heads
with
the
waves
and
all
went
marching
on
to
assail
the
cliffs
of
the
gods
and
wherever
the
rivers
had
broken
the
ranks
of
the
cliffs
slid
armies
went
surging
in
and
broke
them
up
into
islands
and
shattered
the
islands
away
and
the
gods
on
their
heard
once
more
the
voice
of
slid
exulting
over
their
cliffs
already
more
than
half
the
world
lay
subject
to
slid
and
still
his
armies
advanced
and
the
people
of
slid
the
fishes
and
the
long
eels
went
in
and
out
of
arbours
that
once
were
dear
to
the
gods
then
the
gods
feared
for
their
dominion
and
to
the
innermost
sacred
recesses
of
the
mountains
to
the
very
heart
of
the
hills
the
gods
trooped
off
together
and
there
found
tintaggon
a
mountain
of
black
marble
staring
far
over
the
earth
and
spake
thus
to
him
with
the
voices
of
the
gods
o
eldest
born
of
our
mountains
when
first
we
devised
the
earth
we
made
thee
and
thereafter
fashioned
fields
and
hollows
valleys
and
other
hills
to
lie
about
thy
feet
and
now
tintaggon
thine
ancient
lords
the
gods
are
facing
a
new
thing
which
overthrows
the
old
go
therefore
thou
tintaggon
and
stand
up
against
slid
that
the
gods
be
still
the
gods
and
the
earth
still
green
and
hearing
the
voices
of
his
sires
the
elder
gods
tintaggon
strode
down
through
the
evening
leaving
a
wake
of
twilight
broad
behind
him
as
he
strode
and
going
across
the
green
earth
came
down
to
ambrady
at
the
valley
edge
and
there
met
the
foremost
of
slid
fierce
armies
conquering
the
world
and
against
him
slid
hurled
the
force
of
a
whole
bay
which
lashed
itself
high
over
tintaggon
knees
and
streamed
around
his
flanks
and
then
fell
and
was
lost
tintaggon
still
stood
firm
for
the
honour
and
dominion
of
his
lords
the
elder
gods
then
slid
went
to
tintaggon
and
said
let
us
now
make
a
truce
stand
thou
back
from
ambrady
and
let
me
pass
through
thy
ranks
that
mine
armies
may
now
pass
up
the
valley
which
opens
on
the
world
that
the
green
earth
that
dreams
around
the
feet
of
older
gods
shall
know
the
new
god
slid
then
shall
mine
armies
strive
with
thee
no
more
and
thou
and
i
shall
be
the
equal
lords
of
the
whole
earth
when
all
the
world
is
singing
the
chaunt
of
slid
and
thy
head
alone
shall
be
lifted
above
mine
armies
when
rival
hills
are
dead
and
i
will
deck
thee
with
all
the
robes
of
the
sea
and
all
the
plunder
that
i
have
taken
in
rare
cities
shall
be
piled
before
thy
feet
tintaggon
i
have
conquered
all
the
stars
my
song
swells
through
all
the
space
besides
i
come
victorious
from
mahn
and
khanagat
on
the
furthest
edge
of
the
worlds
and
thou
and
i
are
to
be
equal
lords
when
the
old
gods
are
gone
and
the
green
earth
knoweth
slid
behold
me
gleaming
azure
and
fair
with
a
thousand
smiles
and
swayed
by
a
thousand
moods
and
tintaggon
answered
i
am
staunch
and
black
and
have
one
mood
and
this
to
defend
my
masters
and
their
green
earth
then
slid
went
backward
growling
and
summoned
together
the
waves
of
a
whole
sea
and
sent
them
singing
full
in
tintaggon
face
then
from
tintaggon
marble
front
the
sea
fell
backwards
crying
on
to
a
broken
shore
and
ripple
by
ripple
straggled
back
to
slid
saying
tintaggon
stands
far
out
beyond
the
battered
shore
that
lay
at
tintaggon
feet
slid
rested
long
and
sent
the
nautilus
to
drift
up
and
down
before
tintaggon
eyes
and
he
and
his
armies
sat
singing
idle
songs
of
dreamy
islands
far
away
to
the
south
and
of
the
still
stars
whence
they
had
stolen
forth
of
twilight
evenings
and
of
long
ago
still
tintaggon
stood
with
his
feet
planted
fair
upon
the
valley
edge
defending
the
gods
and
their
green
earth
against
the
sea
and
all
the
while
that
slid
sang
his
songs
and
played
with
the
nautilus
that
sailed
up
and
down
he
gathered
his
oceans
together
one
morning
as
slid
sang
of
old
outrageous
wars
and
of
most
enchanting
peace
and
of
dreamy
islands
and
the
south
wind
and
the
sun
he
suddenly
launched
five
oceans
out
of
the
deep
all
to
attack
tintaggon
and
the
five
oceans
sprang
upon
tintaggon
and
passed
above
his
head
one
by
one
the
grip
of
the
oceans
loosened
one
by
one
they
fell
back
into
the
deep
and
still
tintaggon
stood
and
on
that
morning
the
might
of
all
five
oceans
lay
dead
at
tintaggon
feet
that
which
slid
had
conquered
he
still
held
and
there
is
now
no
longer
a
great
green
valley
in
the
south
but
all
that
tintaggon
had
guarded
against
slid
he
gave
back
to
the
gods
very
calm
the
sea
lies
now
about
tintaggon
feet
where
he
stands
all
black
amid
crumbled
cliffs
of
white
with
red
rocks
piled
about
his
feet
and
often
the
sea
retreats
far
out
along
the
shore
and
often
wave
by
wave
comes
marching
in
with
the
sound
of
the
tramping
of
armies
that
all
may
still
remember
the
great
fight
that
surged
about
tintaggon
once
when
he
guarded
the
gods
and
the
green
earth
against
slid
sometimes
in
their
dreams
the
warriors
of
slid
still
lift
their
heads
and
cry
their
battle
cry
then
do
dark
clouds
gather
about
tintaggon
swarthy
brow
and
he
stands
out
menacing
seen
afar
by
ships
where
once
he
conquered
slid
and
the
gods
know
well
that
while
tintaggon
stands
they
and
their
world
are
safe
and
whether
slid
shall
one
day
smite
tintaggon
is
hidden
among
the
secrets
of
the
sea
a
legend
of
the
dawn
when
the
worlds
and
all
began
the
gods
were
stern
and
old
and
they
saw
the
beginning
from
under
eyebrows
hoar
with
years
all
but
inzana
their
child
who
played
with
the
golden
ball
inzana
was
the
child
of
all
the
gods
and
the
law
before
the
beginning
and
thereafter
was
that
all
should
obey
the
gods
yet
hither
and
thither
went
all
pegana
gods
to
obey
the
dawnchild
because
she
loved
to
be
obeyed
it
was
dark
all
over
the
world
and
even
in
pegana
where
dwell
the
gods
it
was
dark
when
the
child
inzana
the
dawn
first
found
her
golden
ball
then
running
down
the
stairway
of
the
gods
with
tripping
feet
chalcedony
onyx
chalcedony
onyx
step
by
step
she
cast
her
golden
ball
across
the
sky
the
golden
ball
went
bounding
up
the
sky
and
the
dawnchild
with
her
flaring
hair
stood
laughing
upon
the
stairway
of
the
gods
and
it
was
day
so
gleaming
fields
below
saw
the
first
of
all
the
days
that
the
gods
have
destined
but
towards
evening
certain
mountains
afar
and
aloof
conspired
together
to
stand
between
the
world
and
the
golden
ball
and
to
wrap
their
crags
about
it
and
to
shut
it
from
the
world
and
all
the
world
was
darkened
with
their
plot
and
the
dawnchild
up
in
pegana
cried
for
her
golden
ball
then
all
the
gods
came
down
the
stairway
right
to
pegana
gate
to
see
what
ailed
the
dawnchild
and
to
ask
her
why
she
cried
then
inzana
said
that
her
golden
ball
had
been
taken
away
and
hidden
by
mountains
black
and
ugly
far
away
from
pegana
all
in
a
world
of
rocks
under
the
rim
of
the
sky
and
she
wanted
her
golden
ball
and
could
not
love
the
dark
thereat
umborodom
whose
hound
was
the
thunder
took
his
hound
in
leash
and
strode
away
across
the
sky
after
the
golden
ball
until
he
came
to
the
mountains
afar
and
aloof
there
did
the
thunder
put
his
nose
to
the
rocks
and
bay
along
the
valleys
and
fast
at
his
heels
followed
umborodom
and
the
nearer
the
hound
the
thunder
came
to
the
golden
ball
the
louder
did
he
bay
but
haughty
and
silent
stood
the
mountains
whose
plot
had
darkened
the
world
all
in
the
dark
among
the
crags
in
a
mighty
cavern
guarded
by
two
twin
peaks
at
last
they
found
the
golden
ball
for
which
the
dawnchild
wept
then
under
the
world
went
umborodom
with
his
thunder
panting
behind
him
and
came
in
the
dark
before
the
morning
from
underneath
the
world
and
gave
the
dawnchild
back
her
golden
ball
and
inzana
laughed
and
took
it
in
her
hands
and
umborodom
went
back
into
pegana
and
at
its
threshold
the
thunder
went
to
sleep
again
the
dawnchild
tossed
the
golden
ball
far
up
into
the
blue
across
the
sky
and
the
second
morning
shone
upon
the
world
on
lakes
and
oceans
and
on
drops
of
dew
but
as
the
ball
went
bounding
on
its
way
the
prowling
mists
and
the
rain
conspired
together
and
took
it
and
wrapped
it
in
their
tattered
cloaks
and
carried
it
away
and
through
the
rents
in
their
garments
gleamed
the
golden
ball
but
they
held
it
fast
and
carried
it
right
away
and
underneath
the
world
then
on
an
onyx
step
inzana
sat
down
and
wept
who
could
no
more
be
happy
without
her
golden
ball
and
again
the
gods
were
sorry
and
the
south
wind
came
to
tell
her
tales
of
most
enchanted
islands
to
whom
she
listened
not
nor
yet
to
the
tales
of
temples
in
lone
lands
that
the
east
wind
told
her
who
had
stood
beside
her
when
she
flung
her
golden
ball
but
from
far
away
the
west
wind
came
with
news
of
three
grey
travellers
wrapt
round
with
battered
cloaks
that
carried
away
between
them
a
golden
ball
then
up
leapt
the
north
wind
he
who
guards
the
pole
and
drew
his
sword
of
ice
out
of
his
scabbard
of
snow
and
sped
away
along
the
road
that
leads
across
the
blue
and
in
the
darkness
underneath
the
world
he
met
the
three
grey
travellers
and
rushed
upon
them
and
drove
them
far
before
him
smiting
them
with
his
sword
till
their
grey
cloaks
streamed
with
blood
and
out
of
the
midst
of
them
as
they
fled
with
flapping
cloaks
all
red
and
grey
and
tattered
he
leapt
up
with
the
golden
ball
and
gave
it
to
the
dawnchild
again
inzana
tossed
the
ball
into
the
sky
making
the
third
day
and
up
and
up
it
went
and
fell
towards
the
fields
and
as
inzana
stooped
to
pick
it
up
she
suddenly
heard
the
singing
of
all
the
birds
that
were
all
the
birds
in
the
world
were
singing
all
together
and
also
all
the
streams
and
inzana
sat
and
listened
and
thought
of
no
golden
ball
nor
ever
of
chalcedony
and
onyx
nor
of
all
her
fathers
the
gods
but
only
of
all
the
birds
then
in
the
woods
and
meadows
where
they
had
all
suddenly
sung
they
suddenly
ceased
and
inzana
looking
up
found
that
her
ball
was
lost
and
all
alone
in
the
stillness
one
owl
laughed
when
the
gods
heard
inzana
crying
for
her
ball
they
clustered
together
on
the
threshold
and
peered
into
the
dark
but
saw
no
golden
ball
and
leaning
forward
they
cried
out
to
the
bat
as
he
passed
up
and
down
bat
that
seest
all
things
where
is
the
golden
ball
and
though
the
bat
answered
none
heard
and
none
of
the
winds
had
seen
it
nor
any
of
the
birds
and
there
were
only
the
eyes
of
the
gods
in
the
darkness
peering
for
the
golden
ball
then
said
the
gods
thou
hast
lost
thy
golden
ball
and
they
made
her
a
moon
of
silver
to
roll
about
the
sky
and
the
child
cried
and
threw
it
upon
the
stairway
and
chipped
and
broke
its
edges
and
asked
for
the
golden
ball
and
limpang
tung
the
lord
of
music
who
was
least
of
all
the
gods
because
the
child
cried
still
for
her
golden
ball
stole
out
of
pegana
and
crept
across
the
sky
and
found
the
birds
of
all
the
world
sitting
in
trees
and
ivy
and
whispering
in
the
dark
he
asked
them
one
by
one
for
news
of
the
golden
ball
some
had
last
seen
it
on
a
neighbouring
hill
and
others
in
trees
though
none
knew
where
it
was
a
heron
had
seen
it
lying
in
a
pond
but
a
wild
duck
in
some
reeds
had
seen
it
last
as
she
came
home
across
the
hills
and
then
it
was
rolling
very
far
away
at
last
the
cock
cried
out
that
he
had
seen
it
lying
beneath
the
world
there
limpang
tung
sought
it
and
the
cock
called
to
him
through
the
darkness
as
he
went
until
at
last
he
found
the
golden
ball
then
limpang
tung
went
up
into
pegana
and
gave
it
to
the
dawnchild
who
played
with
the
moon
no
more
and
the
cock
and
all
his
tribe
cried
out
we
found
it
we
found
the
golden
ball
again
inzana
tossed
the
ball
afar
laughing
with
joy
to
see
it
her
hands
stretched
upwards
her
golden
hair
afloat
and
carefully
she
watched
it
as
it
fell
but
alas
it
fell
with
a
splash
into
the
great
sea
and
gleamed
and
shimmered
as
it
fell
till
the
waters
became
dark
above
it
and
could
be
seen
no
more
and
men
on
the
world
said
how
the
dew
has
fallen
and
how
the
mists
set
in
with
breezes
from
the
streams
but
the
dew
was
the
tears
of
the
dawnchild
and
the
mists
were
her
sighs
when
she
said
there
will
no
more
come
a
time
when
i
play
with
my
ball
again
for
now
it
is
lost
for
ever
and
the
gods
tried
to
comfort
inzana
as
she
played
with
her
silver
moon
but
she
would
not
hear
them
and
went
in
tears
to
slid
where
he
played
with
gleaming
sails
and
in
his
mighty
treasury
turned
over
gems
and
pearls
and
lorded
it
over
the
sea
and
she
said
o
slid
whose
soul
is
in
the
sea
bring
back
my
golden
ball
and
slid
stood
up
swarthy
and
clad
in
seaweed
and
mightily
dived
from
the
last
chalcedony
step
out
of
pegana
threshold
straight
into
ocean
there
on
the
sand
among
the
battered
navies
of
the
nautilus
and
broken
weapons
of
the
swordfish
hidden
by
dark
water
he
found
the
golden
ball
and
coming
up
in
the
night
all
green
and
dripping
he
carried
it
gleaming
to
the
stairway
of
the
gods
and
brought
it
back
to
inzana
from
the
sea
and
out
of
the
hands
of
slid
she
took
it
and
tossed
it
far
and
wide
over
his
sails
and
sea
and
far
away
it
shone
on
lands
that
knew
not
slid
till
it
came
to
its
zenith
and
dropped
towards
the
world
but
ere
it
fell
the
eclipse
dashed
out
from
his
hiding
and
rushed
at
the
golden
ball
and
seized
it
in
his
jaws
when
inzana
saw
the
eclipse
bearing
her
plaything
away
she
cried
aloud
to
the
thunder
who
burst
from
pegana
and
fell
howling
upon
the
throat
of
the
eclipse
who
dropped
the
golden
ball
and
let
it
fall
towards
earth
but
the
black
mountains
disguised
themselves
with
snow
and
as
the
golden
ball
fell
down
towards
them
they
turned
their
peaks
to
ruby
crimson
and
their
lakes
to
sapphires
gleaming
amongst
silver
and
inzana
saw
a
jewelled
casket
into
which
her
plaything
fell
but
when
she
stooped
to
pick
it
up
again
she
found
no
jewelled
casket
with
rubies
silver
or
sapphires
but
only
wicked
mountains
disguised
in
snow
that
had
trapped
her
golden
ball
and
then
she
cried
because
there
was
none
to
find
it
for
the
thunder
was
far
away
chasing
the
eclipse
and
all
the
gods
lamented
when
they
saw
her
sorrow
and
limpang
tung
who
was
least
of
all
the
gods
was
yet
the
saddest
at
the
dawnchild
grief
and
when
the
gods
said
play
with
your
silver
moon
he
stepped
lightly
from
the
rest
and
coming
down
the
stairway
of
the
gods
playing
an
instrument
of
music
went
out
towards
the
world
to
find
the
golden
ball
because
inzana
wept
and
into
the
world
he
went
till
he
came
to
the
nether
cliffs
that
stand
by
the
inner
mountains
in
the
soul
and
heart
of
the
earth
where
the
earthquake
dwelleth
alone
asleep
but
astir
as
he
sleeps
breathing
and
moving
his
legs
and
grunting
aloud
in
the
dark
then
in
the
ear
of
the
earthquake
limpang
tung
said
a
word
that
only
the
gods
may
say
and
the
earthquake
started
to
his
feet
and
flung
the
cave
away
the
cave
wherein
he
slept
between
the
cliffs
and
shook
himself
and
went
galloping
abroad
and
overturned
the
mountains
that
hid
the
golden
ball
and
bit
the
earth
beneath
them
and
hurled
their
crags
about
and
covered
himself
with
rocks
and
fallen
hills
and
went
back
ravening
and
growling
into
the
soul
of
the
earth
and
there
lay
down
and
slept
again
for
a
hundred
years
and
the
golden
ball
rolled
free
passing
under
the
shattered
earth
and
so
rolled
back
to
pegana
and
limpang
tung
came
home
to
the
onyx
step
and
took
the
dawnchild
by
the
hand
and
told
not
what
he
had
done
but
said
it
was
the
earthquake
and
went
away
to
sit
at
the
feet
of
the
gods
but
inzana
went
and
patted
the
earthquake
on
the
head
for
she
said
it
was
dark
and
lonely
in
the
soul
of
the
earth
thereafter
returning
step
by
step
chalcedony
onyx
chalcedony
onyx
up
the
stairway
of
the
gods
she
cast
again
her
golden
ball
from
the
threshold
afar
into
the
blue
to
gladden
the
world
and
the
sky
and
laughed
to
see
it
go
and
far
away
trogool
upon
the
utter
rim
turned
a
page
that
was
numbered
six
in
a
cipher
that
none
might
read
and
as
the
golden
ball
went
through
the
sky
to
gleam
on
lands
and
cities
there
came
the
fog
towards
it
stooping
as
he
walked
with
his
dark
brown
cloak
about
him
and
behind
him
slunk
the
night
and
as
the
golden
ball
rolled
past
the
fog
suddenly
night
snarled
and
sprang
upon
it
and
carried
it
away
hastily
inzana
gathered
the
gods
and
said
the
night
hath
seized
my
golden
ball
and
no
god
alone
can
find
it
now
for
none
can
say
how
far
the
night
may
roam
who
prowls
all
round
us
and
out
beyond
the
worlds
at
the
entreaty
of
their
dawnchild
all
the
gods
made
themselves
stars
for
torches
and
far
away
through
all
the
sky
followed
the
tracks
of
night
as
far
as
he
prowled
abroad
and
at
one
time
slid
with
the
pleiades
in
his
hand
came
nigh
to
the
golden
ball
and
at
another
holding
orion
for
a
torch
but
lastly
limpang
tung
bearing
the
morning
star
found
the
golden
ball
far
away
under
the
world
near
to
the
lair
of
night
and
all
the
gods
together
seized
the
ball
and
night
turning
smote
out
the
torches
of
the
gods
and
thereafter
slunk
away
and
all
the
gods
in
triumph
marched
up
the
gleaming
stairway
of
the
gods
all
praising
little
limpang
tung
who
through
the
chase
had
followed
night
so
close
in
search
of
the
golden
ball
then
far
below
on
the
world
a
human
child
cried
out
to
the
dawnchild
for
the
golden
ball
and
inzana
ceased
from
her
play
that
illumined
world
and
sky
and
cast
the
ball
from
the
threshold
of
the
gods
to
the
little
human
child
that
played
in
the
fields
below
and
would
one
day
die
and
the
child
played
all
day
long
with
the
golden
ball
down
in
the
little
fields
where
the
humans
lived
and
went
to
bed
at
evening
and
put
it
beneath
his
pillow
and
went
to
sleep
and
no
one
worked
in
all
the
world
because
the
child
was
playing
and
the
light
of
the
golden
ball
streamed
up
from
under
the
pillow
and
out
through
the
half
shut
door
and
shone
in
the
western
sky
and
in
the
night
time
into
the
room
and
took
the
ball
gently
for
he
was
a
god
away
from
under
the
pillow
and
brought
it
back
to
the
dawnchild
to
gleam
on
an
onyx
step
but
some
day
night
shall
seize
the
golden
ball
and
carry
it
right
away
and
drag
it
down
to
his
lair
and
slid
shall
dive
from
the
threshold
into
the
sea
to
see
if
it
be
there
and
coming
up
when
the
fishermen
draw
their
nets
shall
find
it
not
nor
yet
discover
it
among
the
sails
limpang
tung
shall
seek
among
the
birds
and
shall
not
find
it
when
the
cock
is
mute
and
up
the
valleys
shall
go
umborodom
to
seek
among
the
crags
and
the
hound
the
thunder
shall
chase
the
eclipse
and
all
the
gods
go
seeking
with
their
stars
but
never
find
the
ball
and
men
no
longer
having
light
of
the
golden
ball
shall
pray
to
the
gods
no
more
who
having
no
worship
shall
be
no
more
the
gods
these
things
be
hidden
even
from
the
gods
the
vengeance
of
men
ere
the
beginning
the
gods
divided
earth
into
waste
and
pasture
pleasant
pastures
they
made
to
be
green
over
the
face
of
earth
orchards
they
made
in
valleys
and
heather
upon
hills
but
harza
they
doomed
predestined
and
foreordained
to
be
a
waste
for
ever
when
the
world
prayed
at
evening
to
the
gods
and
the
gods
answered
prayers
they
forgot
the
prayers
of
all
the
tribes
of
arim
therefore
the
men
of
arim
were
assailed
with
wars
and
driven
from
land
to
land
and
yet
would
not
be
crushed
and
the
men
of
arim
made
them
gods
for
themselves
appointing
men
as
gods
until
the
gods
of
pegana
should
remember
them
again
and
their
leaders
yoth
and
haneth
played
the
part
of
gods
and
led
their
people
on
though
every
tribe
assailed
them
at
last
they
came
to
harza
where
no
tribes
were
and
at
last
had
rest
from
war
and
yoth
and
haneth
said
the
work
is
done
and
surely
now
pegana
gods
will
remember
and
they
built
a
city
in
harza
and
tilled
the
soil
and
the
green
came
over
the
waste
as
the
wind
comes
over
the
sea
and
there
were
fruit
and
cattle
in
harza
and
the
sounds
of
a
million
sheep
there
they
rested
from
their
flight
from
all
the
tribes
and
builded
fables
out
of
all
their
sorrows
till
all
men
smiled
in
harza
and
children
laughed
then
said
the
gods
earth
is
no
place
for
laughter
thereat
they
strode
to
pegana
outer
gate
to
where
the
pestilence
lay
curled
asleep
and
waking
him
up
they
pointed
toward
harza
and
the
pestilence
leapt
forward
howling
across
the
sky
that
night
he
came
to
the
fields
near
harza
and
stalking
through
the
grass
sat
down
and
glared
at
the
lights
and
licked
his
paws
and
glared
at
the
lights
again
but
the
next
night
unseen
through
laughing
crowds
the
pestilence
crept
into
the
city
and
stealing
into
the
houses
one
by
one
peered
into
the
people
eyes
looking
even
through
their
eyelids
so
that
when
morning
came
men
stared
before
them
crying
out
that
they
saw
the
pestilence
whom
others
saw
not
and
thereafter
died
because
the
green
eyes
of
the
pestilence
had
looked
into
their
souls
chill
and
damp
was
he
yet
there
came
heat
from
his
eyes
that
parched
the
souls
of
men
then
came
the
physicians
and
the
men
learned
in
magic
and
made
the
sign
of
the
physicians
and
the
sign
of
the
men
of
magic
and
cast
blue
water
upon
herbs
and
chanted
spells
but
still
the
pestilence
crept
from
house
to
house
and
still
he
looked
into
the
souls
of
men
and
the
lives
of
the
people
streamed
away
from
harza
and
whither
they
went
is
set
in
many
books
but
the
pestilence
fed
on
the
light
that
shines
in
the
eyes
of
men
which
never
appeased
his
hunger
chiller
and
damper
he
grew
and
the
heat
from
his
eyes
increased
when
night
by
night
he
galloped
through
the
city
going
by
stealth
no
more
then
did
men
pray
in
harza
to
the
gods
saying
high
gods
show
clemency
to
harza
and
the
gods
listened
to
their
prayers
but
as
they
listened
they
pointed
with
their
fingers
and
cheered
the
pestilence
on
and
the
pestilence
grew
bolder
at
his
masters
voices
and
thrust
his
face
close
up
before
the
eyes
of
men
he
could
be
seen
by
none
saving
those
he
smote
at
first
he
slept
by
day
lying
in
misty
hollows
but
as
his
hunger
increased
he
sprang
up
even
in
sunlight
and
clung
to
the
chests
of
men
and
looked
down
through
their
eyes
into
their
souls
that
shrivelled
until
almost
he
could
be
dimly
seen
even
by
those
he
smote
not
adro
the
physician
sat
in
his
chamber
with
one
light
burning
making
a
mixing
in
a
bowl
that
should
drive
the
pestilence
away
when
through
his
door
there
blew
a
draught
that
set
the
light
then
because
the
draught
was
cold
the
physician
shivered
and
went
and
closed
the
door
but
as
he
turned
again
he
saw
the
pestilence
lapping
at
his
mixing
who
sprang
and
set
one
paw
upon
adro
shoulder
and
another
upon
his
cloak
while
with
two
he
clung
to
his
waist
and
looked
him
in
the
eyes
two
men
were
walking
in
the
street
one
said
to
the
other
upon
the
morrow
i
will
sup
with
thee
and
the
pestilence
grinned
a
grin
that
none
beheld
baring
his
dripping
teeth
and
crept
away
to
see
whether
upon
the
morrow
those
men
should
sup
together
a
traveller
coming
in
said
this
is
harza
here
will
i
rest
but
his
life
went
further
than
harza
upon
that
day
journey
all
feared
the
pestilence
and
those
that
he
smote
beheld
him
but
none
saw
the
great
shapes
of
the
gods
by
starlight
as
they
urged
their
pestilence
on
then
all
men
fled
from
harza
and
the
pestilence
chased
dogs
and
rats
and
sprang
upward
at
the
bats
as
they
sailed
above
him
who
died
and
lay
in
the
streets
but
soon
he
returned
and
pursued
the
men
of
harza
where
they
fled
and
sat
by
rivers
where
they
came
to
drink
away
below
the
city
then
back
to
harza
went
the
people
of
harza
pursued
by
the
pestilence
still
and
gathered
in
the
temple
of
all
the
gods
save
one
and
said
to
the
high
prophet
what
may
now
be
done
who
answered
all
the
gods
have
mocked
at
prayer
this
sin
must
now
be
punished
by
the
vengeance
of
men
and
the
people
stood
in
awe
the
high
prophet
went
up
to
the
tower
beneath
the
sky
whereupon
beat
the
eyes
of
all
the
gods
by
starlight
there
in
the
sight
of
the
gods
he
spake
in
the
ear
of
the
gods
saying
high
gods
ye
have
made
mock
of
men
know
therefore
that
it
is
writ
in
ancient
lore
and
found
by
prophecy
that
there
is
an
that
waiteth
for
the
gods
who
shall
go
down
from
pegana
in
galleons
of
gold
all
down
the
silent
river
and
into
the
silent
sea
and
there
their
galleons
shall
go
up
in
mist
and
they
shall
be
gods
no
more
and
men
shall
gain
harbour
from
the
mocking
of
the
gods
at
last
in
the
warm
moist
earth
but
to
the
gods
shall
no
ceasing
ever
come
from
being
the
things
that
were
the
gods
when
time
and
worlds
and
death
are
gone
away
nought
shall
then
remain
but
worn
regrets
and
things
that
were
once
gods
in
the
sight
of
the
gods
in
the
ear
of
the
gods
then
the
gods
shouted
all
together
and
pointed
with
their
hands
at
the
high
prophet
throat
and
the
pestilence
sprang
long
since
the
high
prophet
is
dead
and
his
words
are
forgotten
by
men
but
the
gods
know
not
yet
whether
it
be
true
that
is
waiting
for
the
gods
and
him
who
might
have
told
them
they
have
slain
and
the
gods
of
pegana
are
fearing
the
fear
that
hath
fallen
upon
the
gods
because
of
the
vengeance
of
men
for
they
know
not
when
shall
be
or
whether
it
shall
come
when
the
gods
slept
all
the
gods
were
sitting
in
pegana
and
their
slave
time
lay
idle
at
pegana
gate
with
nothing
to
destroy
when
they
thought
of
worlds
worlds
large
and
round
and
gleaming
and
little
silver
moons
then
who
knoweth
when
as
the
gods
raised
their
hands
making
the
sign
of
the
gods
the
thoughts
of
the
gods
became
worlds
and
silver
moons
and
the
worlds
swam
by
pegana
gate
to
take
their
places
in
the
sky
to
ride
at
anchor
for
ever
each
where
the
gods
had
bidden
and
because
they
were
round
and
big
and
gleamed
all
over
the
sky
the
gods
laughed
and
shouted
and
all
clapped
their
hands
then
upon
earth
the
gods
played
out
the
game
of
the
gods
the
game
of
life
and
death
and
on
the
other
worlds
they
did
a
secret
thing
playing
a
game
that
is
hidden
at
last
they
mocked
no
more
at
life
and
laughed
at
death
no
more
and
cried
aloud
in
pegana
will
no
new
thing
be
must
those
four
march
for
ever
round
the
world
till
our
eyes
are
wearied
with
the
treading
of
the
feet
of
the
seasons
that
will
not
cease
while
night
and
day
and
life
and
death
drearily
rise
and
fall
and
as
a
child
stares
at
the
bare
walls
of
a
narrow
hut
so
the
gods
looked
all
listlessly
upon
the
worlds
saying
will
no
new
thing
be
and
in
their
weariness
the
gods
said
ah
to
be
young
again
ah
to
be
fresh
once
more
from
the
brain
of
and
they
turned
away
their
eyes
in
weariness
from
all
the
gleaming
worlds
and
laid
them
down
upon
pegana
floor
for
they
said
it
may
be
that
the
worlds
shall
pass
and
we
would
fain
forget
them
then
the
gods
slept
then
did
the
comet
break
loose
from
his
moorings
and
the
eclipse
roamed
about
the
sky
and
down
on
the
earth
did
three
children
famine
pestilence
and
drought
come
out
to
feed
the
eyes
of
the
famine
were
green
and
the
eyes
of
the
drought
were
red
but
the
pestilence
was
blind
and
smote
about
all
round
him
with
his
claws
among
the
cities
but
as
the
gods
slept
there
came
from
beyond
the
rim
out
of
the
dark
and
unknown
three
yozis
spirits
of
ill
that
sailed
up
the
river
of
silence
in
galleons
with
silver
sails
far
away
they
had
seen
yum
and
gothum
the
stars
that
stand
sentinel
over
pegana
gate
blinking
and
falling
asleep
and
as
they
neared
pegana
they
found
a
hush
wherein
the
gods
slept
heavily
ya
ha
and
snyrg
were
these
three
yozis
the
lords
of
evil
madness
and
of
spite
when
they
crept
from
their
galleons
and
stole
over
pegana
silent
threshold
it
boded
ill
for
the
gods
there
in
pegana
lay
the
gods
asleep
and
in
a
corner
lay
the
power
of
the
gods
alone
upon
the
floor
a
thing
wrought
of
black
rock
and
four
words
graven
upon
it
whereof
i
might
not
give
thee
any
clue
if
even
i
should
find
it
four
words
of
which
none
knoweth
some
say
they
tell
of
the
opening
of
a
flower
towards
dawn
and
others
say
they
concern
earthquakes
among
hills
and
others
that
they
tell
of
the
death
of
fishes
and
others
that
the
words
be
these
power
knowledge
forgetting
and
another
word
that
not
the
gods
themselves
may
ever
guess
these
words
the
yozis
read
and
sped
away
in
dread
lest
the
gods
should
wake
and
going
aboard
their
galleons
bade
the
rowers
haste
thus
the
yozis
became
gods
having
the
power
of
gods
and
they
sailed
away
to
the
earth
and
came
to
a
mountainous
island
in
the
sea
there
they
sat
upon
the
rocks
sitting
as
the
gods
sit
with
their
right
hands
uplifted
and
having
the
power
of
gods
only
none
came
to
worship
thither
came
no
ships
nigh
them
nor
ever
at
evening
came
the
prayers
of
men
nor
smell
of
incense
nor
screams
from
the
sacrifice
then
said
the
yozis
of
what
avails
it
that
we
be
gods
if
no
one
worship
us
nor
give
us
sacrifice
and
ya
ha
and
snyrg
set
sail
in
their
silver
galleons
and
went
looming
down
the
sea
to
come
to
the
shores
of
men
and
first
they
came
to
an
island
where
were
fisher
folk
and
the
folk
of
the
island
running
down
to
the
shore
cried
out
to
them
who
be
ye
and
the
yozis
answered
we
be
three
gods
and
we
would
have
your
worship
but
the
fisher
folk
answered
here
we
worship
rahm
the
thunder
and
have
no
worship
nor
sacrifice
for
other
gods
then
the
yozis
snarled
with
anger
and
sailed
away
and
sailed
till
they
came
to
another
shore
sandy
and
low
and
forsaken
and
at
last
they
found
an
old
man
upon
the
shore
and
they
cried
out
to
him
old
man
upon
the
shore
we
be
three
gods
that
it
were
well
to
worship
gods
of
great
power
and
apt
in
the
granting
of
prayer
the
old
man
answered
we
worship
pegana
gods
who
have
a
fondness
for
our
incense
and
the
sound
of
our
sacrifice
when
it
squeals
upon
the
altar
then
answered
snyrg
asleep
are
pegana
gods
nor
will
they
wake
for
the
humming
of
thy
prayers
which
lie
in
the
dust
upon
pegana
floor
and
over
them
sniracte
the
spider
of
the
worlds
hath
woven
a
web
of
mist
and
the
squealing
of
the
sacrifice
maketh
no
music
in
ears
that
are
closed
in
sleep
the
old
man
answered
standing
upon
the
shore
though
all
the
gods
of
old
shall
answer
our
prayers
no
longer
yet
still
to
the
gods
of
old
shall
all
men
pray
here
in
syrinais
but
the
yozis
turned
their
ships
about
and
angrily
sailed
away
all
cursing
syrinais
and
syrinais
gods
but
most
especially
the
old
man
that
stood
upon
the
shore
still
the
three
yozis
lusted
for
the
worship
of
men
and
came
on
the
third
night
of
their
sailing
to
a
city
lights
and
nearing
the
shore
they
found
it
a
city
of
song
wherein
all
folks
rejoiced
then
sat
each
yozi
on
his
galleon
prow
and
leered
with
his
eyes
upon
the
city
so
that
the
music
stopped
and
the
dancing
ceased
and
all
looked
out
to
sea
at
the
strange
shapes
of
the
yozis
beneath
their
silver
sails
then
snyrg
demanded
their
worship
promising
increase
of
joys
and
swearing
by
the
light
of
his
eyes
that
he
would
send
little
flames
to
leap
over
the
grass
to
pursue
the
enemies
of
that
city
and
to
chase
them
about
the
world
but
the
people
answered
that
in
that
city
men
worshipped
agrodaun
the
mountain
standing
alone
and
might
not
worship
other
gods
even
though
they
came
in
galleons
with
silver
sails
sailing
from
over
the
sea
but
snyrg
answered
certainly
agrodaun
is
only
a
mountain
and
in
no
manner
a
god
but
the
priests
of
agrodaun
sang
answer
from
the
shore
if
the
sacrifice
of
men
make
not
agrodaun
a
god
nor
blood
still
young
on
his
rocks
nor
the
little
fluttering
prayers
of
ten
thousand
hearts
nor
two
thousands
years
of
worship
and
all
the
hopes
of
the
people
and
the
whole
strength
of
our
race
then
are
there
no
gods
and
ye
be
common
sailors
sailing
from
over
the
sea
then
said
the
yozis
hath
agrodaun
answered
prayer
and
the
people
heard
the
words
that
the
yozis
said
then
went
the
priests
of
agrodaun
away
from
the
shore
and
up
the
steep
streets
of
the
city
the
people
following
and
over
the
moor
beyond
it
to
the
foot
of
agrodaun
and
then
said
agrodaun
if
thou
art
not
our
god
go
back
and
herd
with
yonder
common
hills
and
put
a
cap
of
snow
upon
thy
head
and
crouch
far
off
as
they
do
beneath
the
sky
but
if
we
have
given
thee
divinity
in
two
thousand
years
if
our
hopes
are
all
about
thee
like
a
cloak
then
stand
and
look
upon
thy
worshippers
from
over
our
city
for
ever
and
the
smoke
that
ascended
from
his
feet
stood
still
and
there
fell
a
hush
over
great
agrodaun
and
the
priests
went
back
to
the
sea
and
said
to
the
three
yozis
new
gods
shall
have
our
worship
when
agrodaun
grows
weary
of
being
our
god
or
when
in
some
he
shall
stride
away
leaving
us
nought
to
gaze
at
that
is
higher
than
our
city
and
the
yozis
sailed
away
and
cursed
towards
agrodaun
but
could
not
hurt
him
for
he
was
but
a
mountain
and
the
yozis
sailed
along
the
coast
till
they
came
to
a
river
running
to
the
sea
and
they
sailed
up
the
river
till
they
came
to
a
people
at
work
who
furrowed
the
soil
and
sowed
and
strove
against
the
forest
then
the
yozis
called
to
the
people
as
they
worked
in
the
fields
give
us
your
worship
and
ye
shall
have
many
joys
but
the
people
answered
we
may
not
worship
you
then
answered
snyrg
ye
also
have
ye
a
god
and
the
people
answered
we
worship
the
years
to
come
and
we
set
the
world
in
order
for
their
coming
as
one
layeth
raiment
on
the
road
before
the
advent
of
a
king
and
when
those
years
shall
come
they
shall
accept
the
worship
of
a
race
they
knew
not
and
their
people
shall
make
their
sacrifice
to
the
years
that
follow
them
who
in
their
turn
shall
minister
to
the
then
answered
snyrg
gods
that
shall
recompense
you
not
rather
give
us
your
prayers
and
have
our
pleasures
the
pleasures
that
we
shall
give
you
and
when
your
gods
shall
come
let
them
be
wroth
they
can
not
punish
you
but
the
people
continued
to
sacrifice
their
labour
to
their
gods
the
years
to
come
making
the
world
a
place
for
gods
to
dwell
in
and
the
yozis
cursed
those
gods
and
sailed
away
and
ya
the
lord
of
malice
swore
that
when
those
years
should
come
they
should
see
whether
it
were
well
for
them
to
have
snatched
away
the
worship
from
three
yozis
and
still
the
yozis
sailed
for
they
said
it
were
better
to
be
birds
and
have
no
air
to
fly
in
than
to
be
gods
having
neither
prayers
nor
worship
but
where
sky
met
with
ocean
the
yozis
saw
land
again
and
thither
sailed
and
there
the
yozis
saw
men
in
strange
old
garments
performing
ancient
rites
in
a
land
of
many
temples
and
the
yozis
called
to
the
men
as
they
performed
their
ancient
rites
and
said
we
be
three
gods
well
versed
in
the
needs
of
men
to
worship
whom
were
to
obtain
instant
joy
but
the
men
said
we
have
already
gods
and
snyrg
replied
ye
too
the
men
answered
for
we
worship
the
things
that
have
been
and
all
the
years
that
were
divinely
have
they
helped
us
therefore
we
give
them
worship
that
is
their
due
and
the
yozis
answered
the
people
we
be
gods
of
the
present
and
return
good
things
for
worship
but
the
people
answered
saying
from
the
shore
our
gods
have
given
us
already
the
good
things
and
we
return
them
the
worship
that
is
their
due
and
the
yozis
set
their
faces
to
landward
and
cursed
all
things
that
had
been
and
all
the
years
that
were
and
sailed
in
their
galleons
away
a
rocky
shore
in
an
inhuman
land
stood
up
against
the
sea
thither
the
yozis
came
and
found
no
man
but
out
of
the
dark
from
inland
towards
evening
came
a
herd
of
great
baboons
and
chattered
greatly
when
they
saw
the
ships
then
spake
snyrg
to
them
have
ye
too
a
god
and
the
baboons
spat
then
said
the
yozis
we
be
seductive
gods
having
a
particular
remembrance
for
little
prayers
but
the
baboons
leered
fiercely
at
the
yozis
and
would
have
none
of
them
for
gods
one
said
that
prayers
hindered
the
eating
of
nuts
but
snyrg
leaned
forward
and
whispered
and
the
baboons
went
down
upon
their
knees
and
clasped
their
hands
as
men
clasp
and
chattered
prayer
and
said
to
one
another
that
these
were
the
gods
of
old
and
gave
the
yozis
their
worship
for
snyrg
had
whispered
in
their
ears
that
if
they
would
worship
the
yozis
he
would
make
them
men
and
the
baboons
arose
from
worshipping
smoother
about
the
face
and
a
little
shorter
in
the
arms
and
went
away
and
hid
their
bodies
in
clothing
and
afterwards
galloped
away
from
the
rocky
shore
and
went
and
herded
with
men
and
men
could
not
discern
what
they
were
for
their
bodies
were
bodies
of
men
though
their
souls
were
still
the
souls
of
beasts
and
their
worship
went
to
the
yozis
spirits
of
and
the
lords
of
malice
hatred
and
madness
sailed
back
to
their
island
in
the
sea
and
sat
upon
the
shore
as
gods
sit
with
right
hand
uplifted
and
at
evening
foul
prayers
from
the
baboons
gathered
about
them
and
infested
the
rocks
but
in
pegana
the
gods
awoke
with
a
start
the
king
that
was
not
the
land
of
runazar
hath
no
king
nor
ever
had
one
and
this
is
the
law
of
the
land
of
runazar
that
seeing
that
it
hath
never
had
a
king
it
shall
not
have
one
for
ever
therefore
in
runazar
the
priests
hold
sway
who
tell
people
that
never
in
runazar
hath
there
been
a
king
althazar
king
of
runazar
and
lord
of
all
lands
near
by
commanded
for
the
closer
knowledge
of
the
gods
that
their
images
should
be
carven
in
runazar
and
in
all
lands
near
by
and
when
althazar
command
wafted
abroad
by
trumpets
came
tinkling
in
the
ear
of
all
the
gods
right
glad
were
they
at
the
sound
of
it
therefore
men
quarried
marble
from
the
earth
and
sculptors
busied
themselves
in
runazar
to
obey
the
edict
of
the
king
but
the
gods
stood
by
starlight
on
the
hills
where
the
sculptors
might
see
them
and
draped
the
clouds
about
them
and
put
upon
them
their
divinest
air
that
sculptors
might
do
justice
to
pegana
gods
then
the
gods
strode
back
into
pegana
and
the
sculptors
hammered
and
wrought
and
there
came
a
day
when
the
master
of
sculptors
took
audience
of
the
king
saying
althazar
king
of
runazar
high
lord
moreover
of
all
the
lands
near
by
to
whom
be
the
gods
benignant
humbly
have
we
completed
the
images
of
all
such
gods
as
were
in
thine
edict
named
then
the
king
commanded
a
great
space
to
be
cleared
among
the
houses
in
his
city
and
there
the
images
of
all
the
gods
were
borne
and
set
before
the
king
and
there
were
assembled
the
master
of
sculptors
and
all
his
men
and
before
each
stood
a
soldier
bearing
a
pile
of
gold
upon
a
jewelled
tray
and
behind
each
stood
a
soldier
with
a
drawn
sword
pointing
against
their
necks
and
the
king
looked
upon
the
images
and
lo
they
stood
as
gods
with
the
clouds
all
draped
about
them
making
the
sign
of
the
gods
but
their
bodies
were
those
of
men
and
lo
their
faces
were
very
like
the
king
and
their
beards
were
as
the
king
beard
and
the
king
said
these
be
indeed
pegana
gods
and
the
soldiers
that
stood
before
the
sculptors
were
caused
to
present
to
them
the
piles
of
gold
and
the
soldiers
that
stood
behind
the
sculptors
were
caused
to
sheath
their
swords
and
the
people
shouted
these
be
indeed
pegana
gods
whose
faces
we
are
permitted
to
see
by
the
will
of
althazar
the
king
to
whom
be
the
gods
benignant
and
heralds
were
sent
abroad
through
the
cities
of
runazar
and
of
all
the
lands
near
by
proclaiming
of
the
images
these
be
pegana
gods
but
up
in
pegana
the
gods
howled
with
wrath
and
mung
leant
forward
to
make
the
sign
of
mung
against
althazar
the
king
but
the
gods
laid
their
hands
upon
his
shoulder
saying
slay
him
not
for
it
is
not
enough
that
althazar
shall
die
who
hath
made
the
faces
of
the
gods
to
be
like
the
faces
of
men
but
he
must
not
even
have
ever
been
then
said
the
gods
spake
we
of
althazar
a
king
and
the
gods
said
nay
we
spake
not
and
the
gods
said
dreamed
we
of
one
althazar
and
the
gods
said
nay
we
dreamed
not
but
in
the
royal
palace
of
runazar
althazar
passing
suddenly
out
of
the
remembrance
of
the
gods
became
no
longer
a
thing
that
was
or
had
ever
been
and
by
the
throne
of
althazar
lay
a
robe
and
near
it
lay
a
crown
and
the
priests
of
the
gods
entered
his
palace
and
made
it
a
temple
of
the
gods
and
the
people
coming
to
worship
said
whose
was
this
robe
and
to
what
purpose
is
this
crown
and
the
priests
answered
the
gods
have
cast
away
the
fragment
of
a
garment
and
lo
from
the
fingers
of
the
gods
hath
slipped
one
little
ring
and
the
people
said
to
the
priests
seeing
that
runazar
hath
never
had
a
king
therefore
be
ye
our
rulers
and
make
ye
our
laws
in
the
sight
of
pegana
gods
the
cave
of
kai
the
pomp
of
crowning
was
ended
the
rejoicings
had
died
away
and
khanazar
the
new
king
sat
in
the
seat
of
the
kings
of
averon
to
do
his
work
upon
the
destinies
of
men
his
uncle
khanazar
the
lone
had
died
and
he
had
come
from
a
far
castle
to
the
south
with
a
great
procession
to
ilaun
the
citadel
of
averon
and
there
they
had
crowned
him
king
of
averon
and
of
the
mountains
and
lord
if
there
be
aught
beyond
those
mountains
of
all
such
lands
as
are
but
now
the
pomp
of
the
crowning
was
gone
away
and
khanazar
sat
afar
off
from
his
home
a
very
mighty
king
then
the
king
grew
weary
of
the
destinies
of
averon
and
weary
of
the
making
of
commands
so
khanazar
sent
heralds
through
all
cities
saying
hear
the
will
of
the
king
hear
the
will
of
the
king
of
averon
and
of
the
mountains
and
lord
if
there
be
aught
beyond
those
mountains
of
all
such
lands
as
are
let
there
come
together
to
ilaun
all
such
as
have
an
art
in
secret
matters
hear
and
there
gathered
together
to
ilaun
the
wise
men
of
all
the
degrees
of
magic
even
to
the
seventh
who
had
made
spells
before
khanazar
the
lone
and
they
came
before
the
new
king
in
his
palace
placing
their
hands
upon
his
feet
then
said
the
king
to
the
magicians
i
have
a
need
and
they
answered
the
earth
touches
the
feet
of
the
king
in
token
of
submission
but
the
king
answered
my
need
is
not
of
the
earth
but
i
would
find
certain
of
the
hours
that
have
been
and
sundry
days
that
were
and
all
the
wise
folks
were
silent
till
there
spake
out
mournfully
the
wisest
of
them
all
who
made
spells
in
the
seventh
degree
saying
the
days
that
were
and
the
hours
have
winged
their
way
to
mount
agdora
summit
and
there
dipping
have
passed
away
from
sight
not
ever
to
return
for
haply
they
have
not
heard
the
king
command
of
these
wise
folks
are
many
things
chronicled
moreover
it
is
set
in
writing
of
the
scribes
how
they
had
audience
of
king
khanazar
and
of
the
words
they
spake
but
of
their
further
deeds
there
is
no
legend
but
it
is
told
how
the
king
sent
men
to
run
and
pass
through
all
the
cities
till
they
should
find
one
that
was
wiser
even
than
the
magicians
that
had
made
spells
before
khanazar
the
lone
far
up
the
mountains
that
limit
averon
they
found
syrahn
the
prophet
among
the
goats
who
was
of
none
of
the
degrees
of
magic
and
who
had
cast
no
spells
before
the
former
king
him
they
brought
to
khanazar
and
the
king
said
unto
him
i
have
a
need
and
syrahn
answered
thou
art
a
man
and
the
king
said
where
lie
the
days
that
were
and
certain
hours
and
syrahn
answered
these
things
lie
in
a
cave
afar
from
here
and
over
the
cave
stands
sentinel
one
kai
and
this
cave
kai
hath
guarded
from
the
gods
and
men
since
ever
the
beginning
was
made
it
may
be
that
he
shall
let
khanazar
pass
by
then
the
king
gathered
elephants
and
camels
that
carried
burdens
of
gold
and
trusty
servants
that
carried
precious
gems
and
gathered
an
army
to
go
before
him
and
an
army
to
follow
behind
and
sent
out
horsemen
to
warn
the
dwellers
of
the
plains
that
the
king
of
averon
was
afoot
and
he
bade
syrahn
to
lead
to
that
place
where
the
days
of
old
lie
hid
and
all
forgotten
hours
across
the
plain
and
up
mount
agdora
and
dipping
beyond
its
summit
went
khanazar
the
king
and
his
two
armies
who
followed
syrahn
eight
times
the
purple
tent
with
golden
border
had
been
pitched
for
the
king
of
averon
and
eight
times
it
had
been
struck
ere
the
king
and
the
king
armies
came
to
a
dark
cave
in
a
valley
dark
where
kai
stood
guard
over
the
days
that
were
and
the
face
of
kai
was
as
a
warrior
that
vanquisheth
cities
and
burdeneth
himself
not
with
captives
and
his
form
was
as
the
forms
of
gods
but
his
eyes
were
the
eyes
of
beasts
before
whom
came
the
king
of
averon
with
elephants
and
camels
bearing
burdens
of
gold
and
trusty
servants
carrying
precious
gems
then
said
the
king
yonder
behold
my
gifts
give
back
to
me
my
yesterday
with
its
waving
banners
my
yesterday
with
its
music
and
blue
sky
and
all
its
cheering
crowds
that
made
me
king
the
yesterday
that
sailed
with
gleaming
wings
over
my
averon
and
kai
answered
pointing
to
his
cave
thither
dishonoured
and
forgot
thy
yesterday
slunk
away
and
who
amid
the
dusty
heap
of
the
forgotten
days
shall
grovel
to
find
thy
yesterday
then
answered
the
king
of
averon
and
of
the
mountains
and
lord
if
there
be
aught
beyond
them
of
all
such
lands
as
are
i
will
go
down
on
my
knees
in
yon
dark
cave
and
search
with
my
hands
amid
the
dust
if
so
i
may
find
my
yesterday
again
and
certain
hours
that
are
gone
and
the
king
pointed
to
his
piles
of
gold
that
stood
where
elephants
were
met
together
and
beyond
them
to
the
scornful
camels
and
kai
answered
the
gods
have
offered
me
the
gleaming
worlds
and
all
as
far
as
the
rim
and
whatever
lies
beyond
it
as
far
as
the
gods
may
see
and
thou
comest
to
me
with
elephants
and
camels
then
said
the
king
across
the
orchards
of
my
home
there
hath
passed
one
hour
whereof
thou
knowest
well
and
i
pray
to
thee
who
wilt
take
no
gifts
borne
upon
elephants
or
camels
to
give
me
of
thy
mercy
one
second
back
one
grain
of
dust
that
clings
to
that
hour
in
the
heap
that
lies
within
thy
cave
and
at
the
word
mercy
kai
laughed
and
the
king
turned
his
armies
to
the
east
therefore
the
armies
returned
to
averon
and
the
heralds
before
them
cried
here
cometh
khanazar
king
of
averon
and
of
the
mountains
and
lord
if
there
be
aught
beyond
those
mountains
of
all
such
lands
as
are
and
the
king
said
to
them
say
rather
that
here
comes
one
greatly
wearied
who
having
accomplished
nought
returneth
from
a
quest
forlorn
so
the
king
came
again
to
averon
but
it
is
told
how
there
came
into
ilaun
one
evening
as
the
sun
was
setting
a
harper
with
a
golden
harp
desiring
audience
of
the
king
and
it
is
told
how
men
led
him
to
khanazar
who
sat
frowning
alone
upon
his
throne
to
whom
said
the
harper
i
have
a
golden
harp
and
to
its
strings
have
clung
like
dust
some
seconds
out
of
the
forgotten
hours
and
little
happenings
of
the
days
that
were
and
khanazar
looked
up
and
the
harper
touched
the
strings
and
the
old
forgotten
things
were
stirring
again
and
there
arose
a
sound
of
songs
that
had
passed
away
and
long
since
voices
then
when
the
harper
saw
that
khanazar
looked
not
angrily
upon
him
his
fingers
tramped
over
the
chords
as
the
gods
tramp
down
the
sky
and
out
of
the
golden
harp
arose
a
haze
of
memories
and
the
king
leaning
forward
and
staring
before
him
saw
in
the
haze
no
more
his
palace
walls
but
saw
a
valley
with
a
stream
that
wandered
through
it
and
woods
upon
either
hill
and
an
old
castle
standing
lonely
to
the
south
and
the
harper
seeing
a
strange
look
upon
the
face
of
khanazar
said
is
the
king
pleased
who
lords
it
over
averon
and
the
mountains
and
if
there
be
aught
beyond
them
over
all
such
lands
as
are
and
the
king
said
seeing
that
i
am
a
child
again
in
a
valley
to
the
south
how
may
i
say
what
may
be
the
will
of
the
great
king
when
the
stars
shone
high
over
ilaun
and
still
the
king
sat
staring
straight
before
him
all
the
courtiers
drew
away
from
the
great
palace
save
one
that
stayed
and
kept
one
taper
burning
and
with
them
went
the
harper
and
when
the
dawn
came
up
through
silent
archways
into
the
marble
palace
making
the
taper
pale
the
king
still
stared
before
him
and
still
he
sat
there
when
the
stars
shone
again
clearly
and
high
above
ilaun
but
on
the
second
morning
the
king
arose
and
sent
for
the
harper
and
said
to
him
i
am
king
again
and
thou
that
hast
a
skill
to
stay
the
hours
and
mayest
may
bring
again
to
men
their
forgotten
days
thou
shalt
stand
sentinel
over
my
great
and
when
i
go
forth
to
conquer
and
make
my
armies
mighty
thou
shalt
stand
between
that
morrow
and
the
cave
of
kai
and
haply
some
deed
of
mine
and
the
battling
of
my
armies
shall
cling
to
thy
golden
harp
and
not
go
down
dishonoured
into
the
cave
for
my
who
with
such
resounding
stride
goes
trampling
through
my
dreams
is
far
too
kingly
to
herd
with
forgotten
days
in
the
dust
of
things
that
were
but
on
some
future
day
when
kings
are
dead
and
all
their
deeds
forgotten
some
harper
of
that
time
shall
come
and
from
those
golden
strings
awake
those
deeds
that
echo
in
my
dreams
till
my
shall
stride
forth
among
the
lesser
days
and
tell
the
years
that
khanazar
was
a
king
and
answered
the
harper
i
will
stand
sentinel
over
thy
great
and
when
thou
goest
forth
to
conquer
and
make
thine
armies
mighty
i
will
stand
between
thy
morrow
and
the
cave
of
kai
till
thy
deeds
and
the
battling
of
thine
armies
shall
cling
to
my
golden
harp
and
not
go
down
dishonoured
into
the
cave
so
that
when
kings
are
dead
and
all
their
deeds
forgotten
the
harpers
of
the
future
time
shall
awake
from
these
golden
chords
those
deeds
of
thine
this
will
i
do
men
of
these
days
that
be
skilled
upon
the
harp
tell
still
of
khanazar
how
that
he
was
king
of
averon
and
of
the
mountains
and
claimed
lordship
of
certain
lands
beyond
and
how
he
went
with
armies
against
and
fought
great
battles
and
in
the
last
gained
victory
and
was
slain
but
kai
as
he
waited
with
his
claws
to
gather
in
the
last
days
of
khanazar
that
they
might
loom
enormous
in
his
cave
still
found
them
not
and
only
gathered
in
some
meaner
deeds
and
the
days
and
hours
of
lesser
men
and
was
vexed
by
the
shadow
of
a
harper
that
stood
between
him
and
the
world
the
sorrow
of
search
it
is
told
also
of
king
khanazar
how
he
bowed
very
low
unto
the
gods
of
old
none
bowed
so
low
unto
the
gods
of
old
as
did
king
khanazar
one
day
the
king
returning
from
the
worship
of
the
gods
of
old
and
from
bowing
before
them
in
the
temple
of
the
gods
commanded
their
prophets
to
appear
before
him
saying
i
would
know
somewhat
concerning
the
gods
then
came
the
prophets
before
king
khanazar
burdened
with
many
books
to
whom
the
king
said
it
is
not
in
books
thereat
the
prophets
departed
bearing
away
with
them
a
thousand
methods
well
devised
in
books
whereby
men
may
gain
wisdom
of
the
gods
one
alone
remained
a
master
prophet
who
had
forgotten
books
to
whom
the
king
said
the
gods
of
old
are
mighty
and
answered
the
master
prophet
very
mighty
are
the
gods
of
old
then
said
the
king
there
are
no
gods
but
the
gods
of
old
and
answered
the
prophet
there
are
none
other
and
they
two
being
alone
within
the
palace
the
king
said
tell
me
aught
concerning
gods
or
men
if
aught
of
the
truth
be
known
then
said
the
master
prophet
far
and
white
and
straight
lieth
the
road
to
knowing
and
down
it
in
the
heat
and
dust
go
all
wise
people
of
the
earth
but
in
the
fields
before
they
come
to
it
the
very
wise
lie
down
or
pluck
the
flowers
by
the
side
of
the
road
to
knowing
o
king
it
is
hard
and
hot
stand
many
temples
and
in
the
doorway
of
every
temple
stand
many
priests
and
they
cry
to
the
travellers
that
weary
of
the
road
crying
to
them
this
is
the
end
and
in
the
temples
are
the
sounds
of
music
and
from
each
roof
arises
the
savour
of
pleasant
burning
and
all
that
look
at
a
cool
temple
whichever
temple
they
look
at
or
hear
the
hidden
music
turn
in
to
see
whether
it
be
indeed
the
end
and
such
as
find
that
their
temple
is
not
indeed
the
end
set
forth
again
upon
the
dusty
road
stopping
at
each
temple
as
they
pass
for
fear
they
miss
the
end
or
striving
onwards
on
the
road
and
see
nothing
in
the
dust
till
they
can
walk
no
longer
and
are
taken
worn
and
weary
of
their
journey
into
some
other
temple
by
a
kindly
priest
who
shall
tell
them
that
this
also
is
the
end
neither
on
that
road
may
a
man
gain
any
guiding
from
his
fellows
for
only
one
thing
that
they
say
is
surely
true
when
they
say
friend
we
can
see
nothing
for
the
dust
and
of
the
dust
that
hides
the
way
much
has
been
there
since
ever
that
road
began
and
some
is
stirred
up
by
the
feet
of
all
that
travel
upon
it
and
more
arises
from
the
temple
doors
and
o
king
it
were
better
for
thee
travelling
upon
that
road
to
rest
when
thou
hearest
one
calling
this
is
the
end
with
the
sounds
of
music
behind
him
and
if
in
the
dust
and
darkness
thou
pass
by
lo
and
mush
and
the
pleasant
temple
of
kynash
or
sheenath
with
his
opal
smile
or
sho
with
his
eyes
of
agate
yet
shilo
and
mynarthitep
gazo
and
amurund
and
slig
are
still
before
thee
and
the
priests
of
their
temples
will
not
forget
to
call
thee
and
o
king
it
is
told
that
only
one
discerned
the
end
and
passed
by
three
thousand
temples
and
the
priests
of
the
last
were
like
the
priests
of
the
first
and
all
said
that
their
temple
was
at
the
end
of
the
road
and
the
dark
of
the
dust
lay
over
them
all
and
all
were
very
pleasant
and
only
the
road
was
weary
and
in
some
were
many
gods
and
in
a
few
only
one
and
in
some
the
shrine
was
empty
and
all
had
many
priests
and
in
all
the
travellers
were
happy
as
they
rested
and
into
some
his
fellow
travellers
tried
to
force
him
and
when
he
said
i
will
travel
further
many
said
this
man
lies
for
the
road
ends
here
and
he
that
travelled
to
the
end
hath
told
that
when
the
thunder
was
heard
upon
the
road
there
arose
the
sound
of
the
voices
of
all
the
priests
as
far
as
he
could
hear
crying
hearken
to
shilo
hear
mush
lo
kynash
the
voice
of
sho
mynarthitep
is
angry
hear
the
word
of
slig
and
far
away
along
the
road
one
cried
to
the
traveller
that
sheenath
stirred
in
his
sleep
o
king
this
is
very
doleful
it
is
told
that
that
traveller
came
at
last
to
the
utter
end
and
there
was
a
mighty
gulf
and
in
the
darkness
at
the
bottom
of
the
gulf
one
small
god
crept
no
bigger
than
a
hare
whose
voice
came
crying
in
the
cold
i
know
not
and
beyond
the
gulf
was
nought
only
the
small
god
crying
and
he
that
travelled
to
the
end
fled
backwards
for
a
great
distance
till
he
came
to
temples
again
and
entering
one
where
a
priest
cried
this
is
the
end
lay
down
and
rested
on
a
couch
there
yush
sat
silent
carved
with
an
emerald
tongue
and
two
great
eyes
of
sapphire
and
there
many
rested
and
were
happy
and
an
old
priest
coming
from
comforting
a
child
came
over
to
that
traveller
who
had
seen
the
end
and
said
to
him
this
is
yush
and
this
is
the
end
of
wisdom
and
the
traveller
answered
yush
is
very
peaceful
and
this
indeed
the
end
o
king
wouldst
thou
hear
more
and
the
king
said
i
would
hear
all
and
the
master
prophet
answered
there
was
also
another
prophet
and
his
name
was
shaun
who
had
such
reverence
for
the
gods
of
old
that
he
became
able
to
discern
their
forms
by
starlight
as
they
strode
unseen
by
others
among
men
each
night
did
shaun
discern
the
forms
of
the
gods
and
every
day
he
taught
concerning
them
till
men
in
averon
knew
how
the
gods
appeared
all
grey
against
the
mountains
and
how
rhoog
was
higher
than
mount
scagadon
and
how
skun
was
smaller
and
how
asgool
leaned
forward
as
he
strode
and
how
trodath
peered
about
him
with
small
eyes
but
one
night
as
shaun
watched
the
gods
of
old
by
starlight
he
faintly
discerned
some
other
gods
that
sat
far
up
the
slopes
of
the
mountains
in
the
stillness
behind
the
gods
of
old
and
the
next
day
he
hurled
his
robe
away
that
he
wore
as
averon
prophet
and
said
to
his
people
there
be
gods
greater
than
the
gods
of
old
three
gods
seen
faintly
on
the
hills
by
starlight
looking
on
averon
and
shaun
set
out
and
travelled
many
days
and
many
people
followed
him
and
every
night
he
saw
more
clearly
the
shapes
of
the
three
new
gods
who
sat
silent
when
the
gods
of
old
were
striding
among
men
on
the
higher
slopes
of
the
mountain
shaun
stopped
with
all
his
people
and
there
they
built
a
city
and
worshipped
the
gods
whom
only
shaun
could
see
seated
above
them
on
the
mountain
and
shaun
taught
how
the
gods
were
like
grey
streaks
of
light
seen
before
dawn
and
how
the
god
on
the
right
pointed
upward
toward
the
sky
and
how
the
god
on
the
left
pointed
downward
toward
the
ground
but
the
god
in
the
middle
slept
and
in
the
city
shaun
followers
built
three
temples
the
one
on
the
right
was
a
temple
for
the
young
and
the
one
on
the
left
a
temple
for
the
old
and
the
third
was
a
temple
for
the
old
and
the
third
was
a
temple
with
doors
closed
and
barred
therein
none
ever
entered
one
night
as
shaun
watched
before
the
three
gods
sitting
like
pale
light
against
the
mountain
he
saw
on
the
mountain
summit
two
gods
that
spake
together
and
pointed
mocking
the
gods
of
the
hill
only
he
heard
no
sound
the
next
day
shaun
set
out
and
a
few
followed
him
to
climb
to
the
mountain
summit
in
the
cold
to
find
the
gods
who
were
so
great
that
they
mocked
at
the
silent
three
and
near
the
two
gods
they
halted
and
built
for
themselves
huts
also
they
built
a
temple
wherein
the
two
were
carved
by
the
hand
of
shaun
with
their
heads
turned
towards
each
other
with
mockery
on
their
faces
and
their
fingers
pointing
and
beneath
them
were
carved
the
three
gods
of
the
hill
as
actors
making
sport
none
remembered
now
asgool
trodath
skun
and
rhoog
the
gods
of
old
for
many
years
shaun
and
his
few
followers
lived
in
their
huts
upon
the
mountain
summit
worshipping
gods
that
mocked
and
every
night
shaun
saw
the
two
gods
by
starlight
as
they
laughed
to
one
another
in
the
silence
and
shaun
grew
old
one
night
as
his
eyes
were
turned
towards
the
two
he
saw
across
the
mountains
in
the
distance
a
great
god
seated
in
the
plain
and
looming
enormous
to
the
sky
who
looked
with
angry
eyes
towards
the
two
as
they
sat
and
mocked
then
said
shaun
to
his
people
the
few
that
had
followed
him
thither
alas
that
we
may
not
rest
but
beyond
us
in
the
plain
sitteth
the
one
true
god
and
he
is
wroth
with
mocking
let
us
therefore
leave
these
two
that
sit
and
mock
and
let
us
find
the
truth
in
the
worship
of
that
greater
god
who
even
though
he
kill
shall
yet
not
mock
us
but
the
people
answered
thou
hast
taken
from
us
many
gods
and
taught
us
now
to
worship
gods
that
mock
and
if
there
is
laughter
on
their
faces
as
we
die
lo
thou
alone
canst
see
it
and
we
would
rest
but
three
men
who
had
grown
old
with
following
followed
still
and
down
the
steep
mountain
on
the
further
side
shaun
led
them
saying
now
we
shall
surely
know
and
the
three
old
men
answered
we
shall
know
indeed
o
last
of
all
the
prophets
that
night
the
two
gods
mocking
at
their
worshippers
mocked
not
at
shaun
nor
his
three
followers
who
coming
to
the
plain
still
travelled
on
till
they
came
at
last
to
a
place
where
the
eyes
of
shaun
at
night
could
closely
see
the
vast
form
of
their
god
and
beyond
them
as
far
as
the
sky
there
lay
a
marsh
there
they
rested
building
such
shelters
as
they
could
and
said
to
one
another
this
is
the
end
for
shaun
discerneth
that
there
are
no
more
gods
and
before
us
lieth
the
marsh
and
old
age
hath
come
upon
us
and
since
they
could
not
labour
to
build
a
temple
shaun
carved
upon
a
rock
all
that
he
saw
by
starlight
of
the
great
god
of
the
plain
so
that
if
ever
others
forsook
the
gods
of
old
because
they
saw
beyond
them
the
greater
three
and
should
thence
come
to
knowledge
of
the
twain
that
mocked
and
should
yet
persevere
in
wisdom
till
they
saw
by
starlight
him
whom
shaun
named
the
ultimate
god
they
should
still
find
there
upon
the
rock
what
one
had
written
concerning
the
end
of
search
for
three
years
shaun
carved
upon
the
rock
and
rising
one
night
from
carving
saying
now
is
my
labour
done
saw
in
the
distance
four
greater
gods
beyond
the
ultimate
god
proudly
in
the
distance
beyond
the
marsh
these
gods
were
tramping
together
taking
no
heed
of
the
god
upon
the
plain
then
said
shaun
to
his
three
followers
alas
that
we
know
not
yet
for
there
be
gods
beyond
the
marsh
none
would
follow
shaun
for
they
said
that
old
age
must
end
all
quests
and
that
they
would
rather
wait
there
in
the
plain
for
death
than
that
he
should
pursue
them
across
the
marsh
then
shaun
said
farewell
to
his
followers
saying
you
have
followed
me
well
since
ever
we
forsook
the
gods
of
old
to
worship
greater
gods
farewell
it
may
be
that
your
prayers
at
evening
shall
avail
when
you
pray
to
the
god
of
the
plain
but
i
must
go
onward
for
there
be
gods
beyond
so
shaun
went
down
into
the
marsh
and
for
three
days
struggled
through
it
and
on
the
third
night
saw
the
four
gods
not
very
far
away
yet
could
not
discern
their
faces
all
the
next
day
shaun
toiled
on
to
see
their
faces
by
starlight
but
ere
the
night
came
up
or
one
star
shone
at
set
of
sun
shaun
fell
down
before
the
feet
of
his
four
gods
the
stars
came
out
and
the
faces
of
the
four
shone
bright
and
clear
but
shaun
saw
them
not
for
the
labour
of
toiling
and
seeing
was
over
for
shaun
and
lo
they
were
asgool
trodath
skun
and
rhoog
the
gods
of
old
then
said
the
king
it
is
well
that
the
sorrow
of
search
cometh
only
to
the
wise
for
the
wise
are
very
few
also
the
king
said
tell
me
this
thing
o
prophet
who
are
the
true
gods
the
master
prophet
answered
let
the
king
command
the
men
of
yarnith
the
men
of
yarnith
hold
that
nothing
began
until
yarni
zai
uplifted
his
hand
yarni
zai
they
say
has
the
form
of
a
man
but
is
greater
and
is
a
thing
of
rock
when
he
uplifted
his
hand
all
the
rocks
that
wandered
beneath
the
dome
by
which
name
they
call
the
sky
gathered
together
around
yarni
zai
of
the
other
worlds
they
say
nought
but
hold
that
the
stars
are
the
eyes
of
all
the
other
gods
that
look
on
yarni
zai
and
laugh
for
they
are
all
greater
than
he
though
they
have
gathered
no
worlds
around
them
yet
though
they
be
greater
than
yarni
zai
and
though
they
laugh
at
him
when
they
speak
together
beneath
the
dome
they
all
speak
of
yarni
zai
unheard
is
the
speaking
of
the
gods
to
all
except
the
gods
but
the
men
of
yarnith
tell
of
how
their
prophet
iraun
lying
in
the
sand
desert
azrakhan
heard
once
their
speaking
and
knew
thereby
how
yarni
zai
departed
from
all
the
other
gods
to
clothe
himself
with
rocks
and
make
a
world
certain
it
is
that
every
legend
tells
that
at
the
end
of
the
valley
of
yodeth
where
it
becomes
lost
among
black
cliffs
there
sits
a
figure
colossal
against
a
mountain
whose
form
is
the
form
of
a
man
with
the
right
hand
uplifted
but
vaster
than
the
hills
and
in
the
book
of
secret
things
which
the
prophets
keep
in
the
temple
that
stands
in
yarnith
is
writ
the
story
of
the
gathering
of
the
world
as
iraun
heard
it
when
the
gods
spake
together
up
in
the
stillness
above
azrakhan
and
all
that
read
this
may
learn
how
yarni
zai
drew
the
mountains
about
him
like
a
cloak
and
piled
the
world
below
him
it
is
not
set
in
writing
for
how
many
years
yarni
zai
sat
clothed
with
rocks
at
the
end
of
the
valley
of
yodeth
while
there
was
nought
in
all
the
world
save
rocks
and
yarni
zai
but
one
day
there
came
another
god
running
over
the
rocks
across
the
world
and
he
ran
as
the
clouds
run
upon
days
of
storm
and
as
he
sped
towards
yodeth
yarni
zai
sitting
against
his
mountain
with
right
hand
uplifted
cried
out
what
dost
thou
running
across
my
world
and
whither
art
thou
going
and
the
new
god
answered
never
a
word
but
sped
onwards
and
as
he
went
to
left
of
him
and
to
right
of
him
there
sprang
up
green
things
all
over
the
rocks
of
the
world
of
yarni
zai
so
the
new
god
ran
round
the
world
and
made
it
green
saying
in
the
valley
where
yarni
zai
sat
monstrous
against
his
mountain
and
certain
lands
wherein
cradoa
the
drought
browsed
horribly
at
night
further
the
writing
in
the
book
tells
of
how
there
came
yet
another
god
running
speedily
out
of
the
east
as
swiftly
as
the
first
with
his
face
set
westward
and
nought
to
stay
his
running
and
how
he
stretched
both
arms
outward
beside
him
and
to
left
of
him
and
to
right
of
him
as
he
ran
the
whole
world
whitened
and
yarni
zai
called
out
what
dost
thou
running
across
my
world
and
the
new
god
answered
i
bring
the
snow
for
all
the
world
whiteness
and
resting
and
stillness
and
he
stilled
the
running
of
streams
and
laid
his
hand
even
upon
the
head
of
yarni
zai
and
muffled
the
noises
of
the
world
till
there
was
no
sound
in
all
lands
but
the
running
of
the
new
god
that
brought
the
snow
as
he
sped
across
the
plains
but
the
two
new
gods
chased
each
other
for
ever
round
the
world
and
every
year
they
passed
again
running
down
the
valleys
and
up
the
hills
and
away
across
the
plains
before
yarni
zai
whose
hand
uplifted
had
gathered
the
world
about
him
and
furthermore
the
very
devout
may
read
how
all
the
animals
came
up
the
valley
of
yodeth
to
the
mountain
whereon
rested
yarni
zai
saying
give
us
leave
to
live
to
be
lions
rhinoceroses
and
rabbits
and
to
go
about
the
world
and
yarni
zai
gave
leave
to
the
animals
to
be
lions
rhinoceroses
and
rabbits
and
all
the
other
kinds
of
beasts
and
to
go
about
the
world
but
when
they
all
had
gone
he
gave
leave
to
the
bird
to
be
a
bird
and
to
go
about
the
sky
and
further
there
came
a
man
into
that
valley
who
said
yarni
zai
thou
hast
made
animals
into
thy
world
o
yarni
zai
ordain
that
there
be
men
so
yarni
zai
made
men
then
was
there
in
the
world
yarni
zai
and
two
strange
gods
that
brought
the
greenness
and
the
growing
and
the
whiteness
and
the
stillness
and
animals
and
men
and
the
god
of
the
greenness
pursued
the
god
of
the
whiteness
and
the
god
of
the
whiteness
pursued
the
god
of
the
greenness
and
men
pursued
animals
and
animals
pursued
men
but
yarni
zai
sat
still
against
his
mountain
with
his
right
hand
uplifted
but
the
men
of
yarnith
say
that
when
the
arm
of
yarni
zai
shall
cease
to
be
uplifted
the
world
shall
be
flung
behind
him
as
a
man
cloak
is
flung
away
and
yarni
zai
no
longer
clad
with
the
world
shall
go
back
into
the
emptiness
beneath
the
dome
among
the
stars
as
a
diver
seeking
pearls
goes
down
from
the
islands
it
is
writ
in
yarnith
histories
by
scribes
of
old
that
there
passed
a
year
over
the
valley
of
yarnith
that
bore
not
with
it
any
rain
and
the
famine
from
the
wastes
beyond
finding
that
it
was
dry
and
pleasant
in
yarnith
crept
over
the
mountains
and
down
their
slopes
and
sunned
himself
at
the
edge
of
yarnith
fields
and
men
of
yarnith
labouring
in
the
fields
found
the
famine
as
he
nibbled
at
the
corn
and
chased
the
cattle
and
hastily
they
drew
water
from
deep
wells
and
cast
it
over
the
famine
dry
grey
fur
and
drove
him
back
to
the
mountains
but
the
next
day
when
his
fur
was
dry
again
the
famine
returned
and
nibbled
more
of
the
corn
and
chased
the
cattle
further
and
again
men
drove
him
back
but
again
the
famine
returned
and
there
came
a
time
when
there
was
no
more
water
in
the
wells
to
frighten
the
famine
with
and
he
nibbled
the
corn
till
all
of
it
was
gone
and
the
cattle
that
he
chased
grew
very
lean
and
the
famine
drew
nearer
even
to
the
houses
of
men
and
trampled
on
their
gardens
at
night
and
ever
came
creeping
nearer
to
their
doors
at
last
the
cattle
were
able
to
run
no
more
and
one
by
one
the
famine
took
them
by
their
throats
and
dragged
them
down
and
at
night
he
scratched
in
the
ground
killing
even
the
roots
of
things
and
came
and
peered
in
at
the
doorways
and
started
back
and
peered
in
at
the
door
again
a
little
further
but
yet
was
not
bold
enough
to
enter
altogether
for
fear
that
men
should
have
water
to
throw
over
his
dry
grey
fur
then
did
the
men
of
yarnith
pray
to
yarni
zai
as
he
sat
far
off
beyond
the
valley
praying
to
him
night
and
day
to
call
his
famine
back
but
the
famine
sat
and
purred
and
slew
all
the
cattle
and
dared
at
last
to
take
men
for
his
food
and
the
histories
tell
how
he
slew
children
first
and
afterwards
grew
bolder
and
tore
down
women
till
at
last
he
even
sprang
at
the
throats
of
men
as
they
laboured
in
the
fields
then
said
the
men
of
yarnith
there
must
go
one
to
take
our
prayers
to
the
feet
of
yarni
zai
for
the
world
at
evening
utters
many
prayers
and
it
may
be
that
yarni
zai
as
he
hears
all
earth
lamenting
when
the
prayers
at
evening
flutter
to
his
feet
may
have
missed
among
so
many
the
prayers
of
the
men
of
yarnith
but
if
one
go
and
say
to
yarni
zai
is
a
little
crease
in
the
outer
skirts
of
thy
cloak
that
men
call
the
valley
of
yarnith
where
the
famine
is
a
greater
lord
than
yarni
zai
it
may
be
that
he
shall
remember
for
an
instant
and
call
his
famine
back
yet
all
men
feared
to
go
seeing
that
they
were
but
men
and
yarni
zai
was
lord
of
the
whole
earth
and
the
journey
was
far
and
rocky
but
that
night
hothrun
dath
heard
the
famine
whining
outside
his
house
and
pawing
at
his
door
therefore
it
seemed
to
him
more
meet
to
wither
before
the
glance
of
yarni
zai
than
that
the
whining
of
that
famine
should
ever
again
fall
upon
his
ears
so
about
the
dawn
hothrun
dath
crept
away
fearing
still
to
hear
behind
him
the
breathing
of
the
famine
and
set
out
upon
his
journey
whither
pointed
the
graves
of
men
for
men
in
yarnith
are
buried
with
their
feet
and
faces
turned
toward
yarni
zai
lest
he
might
beckon
to
them
in
their
night
and
call
them
to
him
so
all
day
long
did
hothrun
dath
follow
the
way
of
the
graves
it
is
told
that
he
even
journeyed
for
three
days
and
nights
with
nought
but
the
graves
to
guide
him
as
they
pointed
towards
yarni
zai
where
all
the
world
slopes
upwards
towards
yodeth
and
the
great
black
rocks
that
are
nearest
to
yarni
zai
lie
gathered
together
by
clans
till
he
came
to
the
two
great
black
pillars
of
asdarinth
and
saw
the
rocks
beyond
them
piled
in
a
dark
valley
narrow
and
aloof
and
knew
that
this
was
yodeth
then
did
he
haste
no
more
but
walked
quietly
up
the
valley
daring
not
to
disturb
the
stillness
for
he
said
surely
this
is
the
stillness
of
yarni
zai
which
lay
about
him
before
he
clothed
himself
with
rocks
here
among
the
rocks
which
first
had
gathered
to
the
call
of
yarni
zai
hothrun
dath
felt
a
mighty
fear
but
yet
went
onwards
because
of
all
his
people
and
because
he
knew
that
thrice
in
every
hour
in
some
dark
chamber
death
and
famine
met
to
speak
two
words
together
the
end
but
as
dawn
turned
the
darkness
into
grey
he
came
to
the
valley
end
and
even
touched
the
foot
of
yarni
zai
but
saw
him
not
for
he
was
all
hidden
in
the
mist
then
hothrun
dath
feared
that
he
might
not
behold
him
to
look
him
in
the
eyes
when
he
sent
up
his
prayer
but
laying
his
forehead
against
the
foot
of
yarni
zai
he
prayed
for
the
men
of
yarnith
saying
o
lord
of
famine
and
father
of
death
there
is
a
spot
in
the
world
that
thou
hast
cast
about
thee
which
men
call
yarnith
and
there
men
die
before
the
time
thou
hast
apportioned
passing
out
of
yarnith
perchance
the
famine
hath
rebelled
against
thee
or
death
exceeds
his
powers
o
master
of
the
world
drive
out
the
famine
as
a
moth
out
of
thy
cloak
lest
the
gods
beyond
that
regard
thee
with
their
eyes
say
there
is
yarni
zai
and
lo
his
cloak
is
tattered
and
in
the
mist
no
sign
made
yarni
zai
then
did
hothrun
dath
pray
to
yarni
zai
to
make
some
sign
with
his
uplifted
hand
that
he
might
know
he
heard
him
in
the
awe
and
silence
he
waited
until
nigh
the
dawn
the
mist
that
hid
the
figure
rolled
upwards
serene
above
the
mountains
he
brooded
over
the
world
silent
with
right
hand
uplifted
what
hothrun
dath
saw
there
upon
the
face
of
yarni
zai
no
history
telleth
or
how
he
came
again
alive
to
yarnith
but
this
is
writ
that
he
fled
and
none
hath
since
beheld
the
face
of
yarni
zai
some
say
that
he
saw
a
look
on
the
face
of
the
image
that
set
a
horror
tingling
through
his
soul
but
it
is
held
in
yarnith
that
he
found
the
marks
of
instruments
of
carving
about
the
figure
feet
and
discerning
thereby
that
yarni
zai
was
wrought
by
the
hands
of
men
he
fled
down
the
valley
screaming
there
are
no
gods
and
all
the
world
is
lost
and
hope
departed
from
him
and
all
the
purposes
of
life
motionless
behind
him
lit
by
the
rising
sun
sat
the
colossal
figure
with
right
hand
uplifted
that
man
had
made
in
his
own
image
but
the
men
of
yarnith
tell
how
hothrun
dath
came
back
again
panting
to
his
own
city
and
told
the
people
that
there
were
no
gods
and
that
yarnith
had
no
hope
from
yarni
zai
then
the
men
of
yarnith
when
they
knew
that
the
famine
came
not
from
the
gods
arose
and
strove
against
him
they
dug
deep
for
wells
and
slew
goats
for
food
high
up
on
yarnith
mountains
and
went
afar
and
gathered
blades
of
grass
where
yet
it
grew
that
their
cattle
might
live
thus
they
fought
the
famine
for
they
said
if
yarni
zai
be
not
a
god
then
is
there
nothing
mightier
in
yarnith
than
men
and
who
is
the
famine
that
he
should
bare
his
teeth
against
the
lords
of
yarnith
and
they
said
if
no
help
cometh
from
yarni
zai
then
is
there
no
help
but
from
our
own
strength
and
might
and
we
be
yarnith
gods
with
the
saving
of
yarnith
burning
within
us
or
its
doom
according
to
our
desire
and
some
more
the
famine
slew
but
others
raised
their
hands
saying
these
be
the
hands
of
gods
and
drave
the
famine
back
till
he
went
from
the
houses
of
men
and
out
among
the
cattle
and
still
the
men
of
yarnith
pursued
him
till
above
the
heat
of
the
fight
came
the
million
whispers
of
rain
heard
faintly
far
off
towards
evening
then
the
famine
fled
away
howling
back
to
the
mountains
and
over
the
mountains
crests
and
became
no
more
than
a
thing
that
is
told
in
yarnith
legends
a
thousand
years
have
passed
across
the
graves
of
those
that
fell
in
yarnith
by
the
famine
but
the
men
of
yarnith
still
pray
to
yarni
zai
carved
by
men
hands
in
the
likeness
of
a
man
for
they
say
it
may
be
that
the
prayers
we
offer
to
yarni
zai
may
roll
upwards
from
his
image
as
do
the
mists
at
dawn
and
somewhere
find
at
last
the
other
gods
or
that
god
who
sits
behind
the
others
of
whom
our
prophets
know
not
for
the
honour
of
the
gods
of
the
great
wars
of
the
three
islands
are
many
histories
writ
and
of
how
the
heroes
of
the
olden
time
one
by
one
were
slain
but
nought
is
told
of
the
days
before
the
olden
time
or
ever
the
people
of
the
isles
went
forth
to
war
when
each
in
his
own
land
tended
cattle
or
sheep
and
listless
peace
obscured
those
isles
in
the
days
before
the
olden
time
for
then
the
people
of
the
islands
played
like
children
about
the
feet
of
chance
and
had
no
gods
and
went
not
forth
to
war
but
sailors
cast
by
strange
winds
upon
those
shores
which
they
named
the
prosperous
isles
and
finding
a
happy
people
which
had
no
gods
told
how
they
should
be
happier
still
and
know
the
gods
and
fight
for
the
honour
of
the
gods
and
leave
their
names
writ
large
in
histories
and
at
the
last
die
proclaiming
the
names
of
the
gods
and
the
people
of
the
islands
met
and
said
the
beasts
we
know
but
lo
these
sailors
tell
of
things
beyond
that
know
us
as
we
know
the
beasts
and
use
us
for
their
pleasure
as
we
use
the
beasts
but
yet
are
apt
to
answer
idle
prayer
flung
up
at
evening
near
the
hearth
when
a
man
returneth
from
the
ploughing
of
the
fields
shall
we
now
seek
these
gods
and
some
said
we
are
lords
of
the
three
islands
and
have
none
to
trouble
us
and
while
we
live
we
find
prosperity
and
when
we
die
our
bones
have
ease
in
the
quiet
let
us
not
therefore
seek
those
who
may
loom
greater
than
we
do
in
the
islands
three
or
haply
harry
our
bones
when
we
be
dead
but
others
said
the
prayers
that
a
man
mutters
when
the
drought
hath
come
and
all
the
cattle
die
go
up
unheeded
to
the
heedless
clouds
and
if
somewhere
there
be
those
that
garner
prayer
let
us
send
men
to
seek
them
and
to
say
be
men
in
the
isles
called
three
or
sometimes
named
by
sailors
the
prosperous
isles
and
they
be
in
the
central
sea
who
ofttimes
pray
and
it
hath
been
told
us
that
ye
love
the
worship
of
men
and
for
it
answer
prayer
and
we
be
travellers
from
the
islands
three
and
the
people
of
the
islands
were
greatly
allured
by
the
thought
of
strange
things
neither
men
nor
beasts
who
at
evening
answered
prayer
therefore
they
sent
men
down
in
ships
with
sails
to
sail
across
the
sea
and
in
safety
over
the
sea
to
a
far
shore
chance
brought
the
ships
then
over
hill
and
valley
three
men
set
forth
seeking
to
find
the
gods
and
their
comrades
beached
the
ships
and
waited
on
the
shore
and
they
that
sought
the
gods
followed
for
thirty
nights
the
lightnings
in
the
sky
over
five
mountains
and
as
they
came
to
the
summit
of
the
last
they
saw
a
valley
beneath
them
and
lo
the
gods
for
there
the
gods
sat
each
on
a
marble
hill
each
sitting
with
an
elbow
on
his
knee
and
his
chin
upon
his
hand
and
all
the
gods
were
smiling
about
their
lips
and
below
them
there
were
armies
of
little
men
and
about
the
feet
of
the
gods
they
fought
against
each
other
and
slew
one
another
for
the
honour
of
the
gods
and
for
the
glory
of
the
name
of
the
gods
and
round
them
in
the
valley
their
cities
that
they
had
builded
with
the
toil
of
their
hands
they
burned
for
the
honour
of
the
gods
where
they
died
for
the
honour
of
the
gods
and
the
gods
looked
down
and
smiled
and
up
from
the
valley
fluttered
the
prayers
of
men
and
here
and
there
the
gods
did
answer
a
prayer
but
oftentimes
they
mocked
them
and
all
the
while
men
died
and
they
that
had
sought
the
gods
from
the
islands
three
having
seen
what
they
had
seen
lay
down
on
the
mountain
summit
lest
the
gods
should
see
them
then
they
crept
backward
a
little
space
still
lying
down
and
whispered
together
and
then
stooped
low
and
ran
and
travelled
across
the
mountains
in
twenty
days
and
came
again
to
their
comrades
by
the
shore
but
their
comrades
asked
them
if
their
quest
had
failed
and
the
three
men
only
answered
we
have
seen
the
gods
and
setting
sail
the
ships
hove
back
across
the
central
sea
and
came
again
to
the
islands
three
where
rest
the
feet
of
chance
and
said
to
the
people
we
have
seen
the
gods
but
to
the
rulers
of
the
islands
they
told
how
the
gods
drove
men
in
herds
and
went
back
and
tended
their
flocks
again
all
in
the
prosperous
isles
and
were
kinder
to
their
cattle
after
they
had
seen
how
that
the
gods
used
men
but
the
gods
walking
large
about
their
valley
and
peering
over
the
great
mountain
rim
saw
one
morning
the
tracks
of
the
three
men
then
the
gods
bent
their
faces
low
over
the
tracks
and
leaning
forward
ran
and
came
before
the
evening
of
the
day
to
the
shore
where
the
men
had
set
sail
in
ships
and
saw
the
tracks
of
ships
upon
the
sand
and
waded
far
out
into
the
sea
and
yet
saw
nought
still
it
had
been
well
for
the
islands
three
had
not
certain
men
that
had
heard
the
tale
sought
also
to
see
the
gods
themselves
these
in
the
slipped
away
from
the
isles
in
ships
and
ere
the
gods
had
retreated
to
the
hills
they
saw
where
ocean
meets
with
sky
the
full
white
sails
of
those
that
sought
the
gods
upon
an
evil
day
then
for
a
while
the
people
of
those
gods
had
rest
while
the
gods
lurked
behind
the
mountain
waiting
for
the
travellers
from
the
prosperous
isles
but
the
travellers
came
to
shore
and
beached
their
ships
and
sent
six
of
their
number
to
the
mountain
whereof
they
had
been
told
but
they
after
many
days
returned
having
not
seen
the
gods
but
only
the
smoke
that
went
upward
from
burned
cities
and
vultures
that
stood
in
the
sky
instead
of
answered
prayer
and
they
all
ran
down
their
ships
again
into
the
sea
and
set
sail
again
and
came
to
the
prosperous
isles
but
in
the
distance
crouching
behind
the
ships
the
gods
came
wading
through
the
sea
that
they
might
have
the
worship
of
the
isles
and
to
every
isle
of
the
three
the
gods
showed
themselves
in
different
garb
and
guise
and
to
all
they
said
leave
your
flocks
go
forth
and
fight
for
the
honour
of
the
gods
and
from
one
of
the
isles
all
the
folk
came
forth
in
ships
to
battle
for
gods
that
strode
through
the
isle
like
kings
and
from
another
they
came
to
fight
for
gods
that
walked
like
humble
men
upon
the
earth
in
beggars
rags
and
the
people
of
the
other
isle
fought
for
the
honour
of
gods
that
were
clothed
in
hair
like
beasts
and
had
many
gleaming
eyes
and
claws
upon
their
foreheads
but
of
how
these
people
fought
till
the
isles
grew
desolate
but
very
glorious
and
all
for
the
fame
of
the
gods
are
many
histories
writ
night
and
morning
once
in
an
arbour
of
the
gods
above
the
fields
of
twilight
night
wandering
alone
came
suddenly
on
morning
then
night
drew
from
his
face
his
cloak
of
dark
grey
mists
and
said
see
i
am
night
and
they
two
sitting
in
that
arbour
of
the
gods
night
told
wondrous
stories
of
old
mysterious
happenings
in
the
dark
and
morning
sat
and
wondered
gazing
into
the
face
of
night
and
at
his
wreath
of
stars
and
morning
told
how
the
rains
of
snamarthis
smoked
in
the
plain
but
night
told
how
snamarthis
held
riot
in
the
dark
with
revelry
and
drinking
and
tales
told
by
kings
till
all
the
hosts
of
meenath
crept
against
it
and
the
lights
went
out
and
there
arose
the
din
of
arms
or
ever
morning
came
and
night
told
how
sindana
the
beggar
had
dreamed
that
he
was
a
king
and
morning
told
how
she
had
seen
sindana
find
suddenly
an
army
in
the
plain
and
how
he
had
gone
to
it
thinking
he
was
king
and
the
army
had
believed
him
and
sindana
now
ruled
over
marthis
and
targadrides
dynath
zahn
and
tumeida
and
most
night
loved
to
tell
of
assarnees
whose
ruins
are
scant
memories
on
the
desert
edge
but
morning
told
of
the
twin
cities
of
nardis
and
timaut
that
lorded
over
the
plain
and
night
told
terribly
of
what
mynandes
found
when
he
walked
through
his
own
city
in
the
dark
and
ever
at
the
elbow
of
regal
night
whispers
arose
saying
tell
morning
and
ever
night
told
and
ever
morning
wondered
and
night
spake
on
and
told
what
the
dead
had
done
when
they
came
in
the
darkness
on
the
king
that
had
led
them
into
battle
once
and
night
knew
who
slew
darnex
and
how
it
was
done
moreover
he
told
why
the
seven
kings
tortured
sydatheris
and
what
sydatheris
said
just
at
the
last
and
how
the
kings
went
forth
and
took
their
lives
and
night
told
whose
blood
had
stained
the
marble
steps
that
lead
to
the
temple
in
ozahn
and
why
the
skull
within
it
wears
a
golden
crown
and
whose
soul
is
in
the
wolf
that
howls
in
the
dark
against
the
city
and
night
knew
whither
the
tigers
go
out
of
the
irasian
desert
and
the
place
where
they
meet
together
and
who
speaks
to
them
and
what
she
says
and
why
and
he
told
why
human
teeth
had
bitten
the
iron
hinge
in
the
great
gate
that
swings
in
the
walls
of
mondas
and
who
came
up
out
of
the
marsh
alone
in
the
darktime
and
demanded
audience
of
the
king
and
told
the
king
a
lie
and
how
the
king
believing
it
went
down
into
the
vaults
of
his
palace
and
found
only
toads
and
snakes
who
slew
the
king
and
he
told
of
ventures
in
palace
towers
in
the
quiet
and
knew
the
spell
whereby
a
man
might
send
the
light
of
the
moon
right
into
the
soul
of
his
foe
and
night
spoke
of
the
forest
and
the
stirring
of
shadows
and
soft
feet
pattering
and
peering
eyes
and
of
the
fear
that
sits
behind
the
trees
taking
to
itself
the
shape
of
something
crouched
to
spring
but
far
under
that
arbour
of
the
gods
down
on
the
earth
the
mountain
peak
mondana
looked
morning
in
the
eyes
and
forsook
his
allegiance
to
night
and
one
by
one
the
lesser
hills
about
mondana
knees
greeted
the
morning
and
all
the
while
in
the
plains
the
shapes
of
cities
came
looming
out
of
the
dusk
and
kongros
stood
forth
with
all
her
pinnacles
and
the
winged
figure
of
poesy
carved
upon
the
eastern
portal
of
her
gate
and
the
squat
figure
of
avarice
carved
facing
it
upon
the
west
and
the
bat
began
to
tire
of
going
up
and
down
her
streets
and
already
the
owl
was
home
and
the
dark
lions
went
up
out
of
the
plain
back
to
their
caves
again
not
as
yet
shone
any
dew
upon
the
spider
snare
nor
came
the
sound
of
any
insects
stirring
or
bird
of
the
day
and
full
allegiance
all
the
valleys
owned
still
to
their
lord
the
night
yet
earth
was
preparing
for
another
ruler
and
kingdom
by
kingdom
she
stole
away
from
night
and
there
marched
through
the
dreams
of
men
a
million
heralds
that
cried
with
the
voice
of
the
cock
lo
morning
come
behind
us
but
in
that
arbour
of
the
gods
above
the
fields
of
twilight
the
star
wreath
was
paling
about
the
head
of
night
and
ever
more
wonderful
on
morning
brow
appeared
the
mark
of
power
and
at
the
moment
when
the
camp
fires
pale
and
the
smoke
goes
grey
to
the
sky
and
camels
sniff
the
dawn
suddenly
morning
forgot
night
and
out
of
that
arbour
of
the
gods
and
away
to
the
haunts
of
the
dark
night
with
his
swart
cloak
slunk
away
and
morning
placed
her
hand
upon
the
mists
and
drew
them
upward
and
revealed
the
earth
and
drove
the
shadows
before
her
and
they
followed
night
and
suddenly
the
mystery
quitted
haunting
shapes
and
an
old
glamour
was
gone
and
far
and
wide
over
the
fields
of
earth
a
new
splendour
arose
usury
the
men
of
zonu
hold
that
yahn
is
god
who
sits
as
a
usurer
behind
a
heap
of
little
lustrous
gems
and
ever
clutches
at
them
with
both
his
arms
scarce
larger
than
a
drop
of
water
are
the
gleaming
jewels
that
lie
under
the
grasping
talons
of
yahn
and
every
jewel
is
a
life
men
tell
in
zonu
that
the
earth
was
empty
when
yahn
devised
his
plan
and
on
it
no
life
stirred
then
yahn
lured
to
him
shadows
whose
home
was
beyond
the
rim
who
knew
little
of
joys
and
nought
of
any
sorrow
whose
place
was
beyond
the
rim
before
the
birth
of
time
these
yahn
lured
to
him
and
showed
them
his
heap
of
gems
and
in
the
jewels
there
was
light
and
green
fields
glistened
in
them
and
there
were
glimpses
of
blue
sky
and
little
streams
and
very
faintly
little
gardens
showed
that
flowered
in
orchard
lands
and
some
showed
winds
in
the
heaven
and
some
showed
the
arch
of
the
sky
with
a
waste
plain
drawn
across
it
with
grasses
bent
in
the
wind
and
never
aught
but
the
plain
but
the
gems
that
changed
the
most
had
in
their
centre
the
ever
changing
sea
then
the
shadows
gazed
into
the
lives
and
saw
the
green
fields
and
the
sea
and
earth
and
the
gardens
of
earth
and
yahn
said
i
will
loan
you
each
a
life
and
you
may
do
your
work
with
it
upon
the
scheme
of
things
and
have
each
a
shadow
for
his
servant
in
green
fields
and
in
gardens
only
for
these
things
you
shall
polish
these
lives
with
experience
and
cut
their
edges
with
your
griefs
and
in
the
end
shall
return
them
again
to
me
and
thereto
the
shadows
consented
that
they
might
have
gleaming
lives
and
have
shadows
for
their
servants
and
this
thing
became
the
law
but
the
shadows
each
with
his
life
departed
and
came
to
zonu
and
to
other
lands
and
there
with
experience
they
polished
the
lives
of
yahn
and
cut
them
with
human
griefs
until
they
gleamed
anew
and
ever
they
found
new
scenes
to
gleam
within
these
lives
and
cities
and
sails
and
men
shone
in
them
where
there
had
been
before
only
green
fields
and
sea
and
ever
yahn
the
usurer
cried
out
to
remind
them
of
their
bargain
when
men
added
to
their
lives
scenes
that
were
pleasant
to
yahn
then
was
yahn
silent
but
when
they
added
scenes
that
pleased
not
the
eyes
of
yahn
then
did
he
take
a
toll
of
sorrow
from
them
because
it
was
the
law
but
men
forgot
the
usurer
and
there
arose
some
claiming
to
be
wise
in
the
law
who
said
that
after
their
labour
which
they
wrought
upon
their
lives
was
done
those
lives
should
be
theirs
to
possess
so
men
took
comfort
from
their
toil
and
labour
and
the
grinding
and
cutting
of
their
griefs
but
as
their
lives
began
to
shine
with
experience
of
many
things
the
thumb
and
forefinger
of
yahn
would
suddenly
close
upon
a
life
and
the
man
became
a
shadow
but
away
beyond
the
rim
the
shadows
say
we
have
greatly
laboured
for
yahn
and
have
gathered
griefs
in
the
world
and
caused
his
lives
to
shine
and
yahn
doeth
nought
for
us
far
better
had
we
stayed
where
no
cares
are
floating
beyond
the
rim
and
there
the
shadows
fear
lest
ever
again
they
be
lured
by
specious
promises
to
suffer
usury
at
the
hands
of
yahn
who
is
overskilled
in
law
only
yahn
sits
and
smiles
watching
his
hoard
increase
in
preciousness
and
hath
no
pity
for
the
poor
shadows
whom
he
hath
lured
from
their
quiet
to
toil
in
the
form
of
men
and
ever
yahn
lures
more
shadows
and
sends
them
to
brighten
his
lives
sending
the
old
lives
out
again
to
make
them
brighter
still
and
sometimes
he
gives
to
a
shadow
a
life
that
was
once
a
king
and
sendeth
him
with
it
down
to
the
earth
to
play
the
part
of
a
beggar
or
sometimes
he
sendeth
a
beggar
life
to
play
the
part
of
a
king
what
careth
yahn
the
men
of
zonu
have
been
promised
by
those
that
claim
to
be
wise
in
the
law
that
their
lives
which
they
have
toiled
at
shall
be
theirs
to
possess
for
ever
yet
the
men
of
zonu
fear
that
yahn
is
greater
and
overskilled
in
the
law
moreover
it
hath
been
said
that
time
will
bring
the
hour
when
the
wealth
of
yahn
shall
be
such
as
his
dreams
have
lusted
for
then
shall
yahn
leave
the
earth
at
rest
and
trouble
the
shadows
no
more
but
sit
and
gloat
with
his
unseemly
face
over
his
hoard
of
lives
for
his
soul
is
a
usurer
soul
but
others
say
and
they
swear
that
this
is
true
that
there
are
gods
of
old
who
be
far
greater
than
yahn
who
made
the
law
wherein
yahn
is
overskilled
and
who
will
one
day
drive
a
bargain
with
him
that
shall
be
too
hard
for
yahn
then
yahn
shall
wander
away
a
mean
forgotten
god
and
perchance
in
some
forsaken
land
shall
haggle
with
the
rain
for
a
drop
of
water
to
drink
for
his
soul
is
a
usurer
soul
and
the
lives
who
knoweth
the
gods
of
old
or
what
their
will
shall
be
mlideen
upon
an
evening
of
the
forgotten
years
the
gods
were
seated
upon
mowrah
nawut
above
mlideen
holding
the
avalanche
in
leash
all
in
the
middle
city
stood
the
temples
of
the
city
priests
and
hither
came
all
the
people
of
mlideen
to
bring
them
gifts
and
there
it
was
the
wont
of
the
city
priests
to
carve
them
gods
for
mlideen
for
in
a
room
apart
in
the
temple
of
eld
in
the
midst
of
the
temples
that
stood
in
the
middle
city
of
mlideen
there
lay
a
book
called
the
book
of
beautiful
devices
writ
in
a
language
that
no
man
may
read
and
writ
long
ago
telling
how
a
man
may
make
for
himself
gods
that
shall
neither
rage
nor
seek
revenge
against
a
little
people
and
ever
the
priests
came
forth
from
reading
in
the
book
of
beautiful
devices
and
ever
they
sought
to
make
benignant
gods
and
all
the
gods
that
they
made
were
different
from
each
other
only
their
eyes
turned
all
upon
mlideen
but
upon
mowrah
nawut
for
all
of
the
forgotten
years
the
gods
had
waited
and
forborne
until
the
people
of
mlideen
should
have
carven
one
hundred
gods
never
came
lightnings
from
mowrah
nawut
crashing
upon
mlideen
nor
blight
on
harvests
nor
pestilence
in
the
city
only
upon
mowrah
nawut
the
gods
sat
and
smiled
the
people
of
mlideen
had
said
yoma
is
god
and
the
gods
sat
and
smiled
and
after
the
forgetting
of
yoma
and
the
passing
of
years
the
people
had
said
zungari
is
god
and
the
gods
sat
and
smiled
then
on
the
altar
of
zungari
a
priest
had
set
a
figure
squat
carven
in
purple
agate
saying
yazun
is
god
still
the
gods
sat
and
smiled
about
the
feet
of
yonu
bazun
nidish
and
sundrao
had
gone
the
worship
of
the
people
of
mlideen
and
still
the
gods
sat
holding
the
avalanche
in
leash
above
the
city
there
set
a
great
calm
towards
sunset
over
the
heights
and
mowrah
nawut
stood
up
still
with
gleaming
snow
and
into
the
hot
city
cool
breezes
blew
from
his
benignant
slopes
as
tarsi
zalo
high
prophet
of
mlideen
carved
out
of
a
great
sapphire
the
city
hundredth
god
and
then
upon
mowrah
nawut
the
gods
turned
away
saying
one
hundred
infamies
have
now
been
wrought
and
they
looked
no
longer
upon
mlideen
and
held
the
avalanche
no
more
in
leash
and
he
leapt
forward
howling
over
the
middle
city
of
mlideen
now
lies
a
mass
of
rocks
and
on
the
rocks
a
new
city
is
builded
wherein
people
dwell
who
know
not
old
mlideen
and
the
gods
are
seated
on
mowrah
nawut
still
and
in
the
new
city
men
worship
carven
gods
and
the
number
of
the
gods
that
they
have
carven
is
ninety
and
nine
and
i
the
prophet
have
found
a
curious
stone
and
go
to
carve
it
into
the
likeness
of
a
god
for
all
mlideen
to
worship
the
secret
of
the
gods
zyni
moe
the
small
snake
saw
the
cool
river
gleaming
before
him
afar
off
and
set
out
over
the
burning
sand
to
reach
it
uldoon
the
prophet
came
out
of
the
desert
and
followed
up
the
bank
of
the
river
towards
his
old
home
thirty
years
since
uldoon
had
left
the
city
where
he
was
born
to
live
his
life
in
a
silent
place
where
he
might
search
for
the
secret
of
the
gods
the
name
of
his
home
was
the
city
by
the
river
and
in
that
city
many
prophets
taught
concerning
many
gods
and
men
made
many
secrets
for
themselves
but
all
the
while
none
knew
the
secret
of
the
gods
nor
might
any
seek
to
find
it
for
if
any
sought
men
said
of
him
this
man
sins
for
he
giveth
no
worship
to
the
gods
that
speak
to
our
prophets
by
starlight
when
none
heareth
and
uldoon
perceived
that
the
mind
of
a
man
is
as
a
garden
and
that
his
thoughts
are
as
the
flowers
and
the
prophets
of
a
man
city
are
as
many
gardeners
who
weed
and
trim
and
who
have
made
in
the
garden
paths
both
smooth
and
straight
and
only
along
these
paths
is
a
soul
permitted
to
go
lest
the
gardeners
say
this
soul
transgresseth
and
from
the
paths
the
gardeners
weed
out
every
flower
that
grows
and
in
the
garden
they
cut
off
all
flowers
that
grow
tall
saying
it
is
customary
and
it
is
written
and
this
hath
ever
been
or
that
hath
not
been
before
therefore
uldoon
saw
that
not
in
that
city
might
he
discover
the
secret
of
the
gods
and
uldoon
said
to
the
people
when
the
worlds
began
the
secret
of
the
gods
lay
written
clear
over
the
whole
earth
but
the
feet
of
many
prophets
have
trampled
it
out
your
prophets
are
all
true
men
but
i
go
into
the
desert
to
find
a
truth
which
is
truer
than
your
prophets
therefore
uldoon
went
into
the
desert
and
in
storm
and
still
he
sought
for
many
years
when
the
thunder
roared
over
the
mountains
that
limited
the
desert
he
sought
the
secret
in
the
thunder
but
the
gods
spake
not
by
the
thunder
when
the
voices
of
the
beasts
disturbed
the
stillness
under
the
stars
he
sought
the
secret
there
but
the
gods
spake
not
by
the
beasts
uldoon
grew
old
and
all
the
voices
of
the
desert
had
spoken
to
uldoon
but
not
the
gods
when
one
night
he
heard
them
whispering
beyond
the
hills
and
the
gods
whispered
one
to
another
and
turning
their
faces
earthward
they
all
wept
and
uldoon
though
he
saw
not
the
gods
yet
saw
their
shadows
turn
as
they
went
back
to
a
great
hollow
in
the
hills
and
there
all
standing
in
the
valley
mouth
they
said
oh
morning
zai
oh
oldest
of
the
gods
the
faith
of
thee
is
gone
and
yesterday
for
the
last
time
thy
name
was
spoken
upon
earth
and
turning
earthward
they
all
wept
again
and
the
gods
tore
white
clouds
out
of
the
sky
and
draped
them
about
the
body
of
morning
zai
and
bore
him
forth
from
his
valley
behind
the
hills
and
muffled
the
mountain
peaks
with
snow
and
beat
upon
their
summits
with
drum
sticks
carved
of
ebony
playing
the
dirge
of
the
gods
and
the
echoes
rolled
about
the
passes
and
the
winds
howled
because
the
faith
of
the
olden
days
was
gone
and
with
it
had
sped
the
soul
of
morning
zai
so
through
the
mountain
passes
the
gods
came
at
night
bearing
their
dead
father
and
uldoon
followed
and
the
gods
came
to
a
great
sepulchre
of
onyx
that
stood
upon
four
fluted
pillars
of
white
marble
each
carved
out
of
four
mountains
and
therein
the
gods
laid
morning
zai
because
the
old
faith
was
fallen
and
there
at
the
tomb
of
their
father
the
gods
spake
and
uldoon
heard
the
secret
of
the
gods
and
it
became
to
him
a
simple
thing
such
as
a
man
might
well
guess
yet
hath
not
then
the
soul
of
the
desert
arose
and
cast
over
the
tomb
its
wreath
of
forgetfulness
devised
of
drifting
sand
and
the
gods
strode
home
across
the
mountains
to
their
hollow
land
but
uldoon
left
the
desert
and
travelled
many
days
and
so
came
to
the
river
where
it
passes
beyond
the
city
to
seek
the
sea
and
following
its
bank
came
near
to
his
old
home
and
the
people
of
the
city
by
the
river
seeing
him
far
off
cried
out
hast
thou
found
the
secret
of
the
gods
and
he
answered
i
have
found
it
and
the
secret
of
the
gods
is
this
zyni
moe
the
small
snake
seeing
the
figure
and
the
shadow
of
a
man
between
him
and
the
cool
river
raised
his
head
and
struck
once
and
the
gods
are
pleased
with
zyni
moe
and
have
called
him
the
protector
of
the
secret
of
the
gods
the
south
wind
two
players
sat
down
to
play
a
game
together
to
while
eternity
away
and
they
chose
the
gods
as
pieces
wherewith
to
play
their
game
and
for
their
board
of
playing
they
chose
the
sky
from
rim
to
rim
whereon
lay
a
little
dust
and
every
speck
of
dust
was
a
world
upon
the
board
of
playing
and
the
players
were
robed
and
their
faces
veiled
and
the
robes
and
veils
were
alike
and
their
names
were
fate
and
chance
and
as
they
played
their
game
and
moved
the
gods
hither
and
thither
about
the
board
the
dust
arose
and
shone
in
the
light
from
the
eyes
that
gleamed
behind
the
veils
then
said
the
gods
see
how
we
stir
the
dust
it
chanced
or
was
ordained
who
knoweth
which
that
ord
a
prophet
one
night
saw
the
gods
as
they
strode
knee
deep
among
the
stars
but
as
he
gave
them
worship
he
saw
the
hand
of
a
player
enormous
over
their
heads
stretched
out
to
make
his
move
then
ord
the
prophet
knew
had
he
been
silent
it
might
have
still
been
well
with
ord
but
ord
went
about
the
world
crying
out
to
all
men
there
is
a
power
over
the
gods
this
the
gods
heard
then
said
they
ord
hath
seen
terrible
is
the
vengeance
of
the
gods
and
fierce
were
their
eyes
when
they
looked
on
the
head
of
ord
and
snatched
out
of
his
mind
all
knowledge
of
themselves
and
that
man
soul
went
wandering
afield
to
find
for
itself
gods
for
ever
finding
them
not
then
out
of
dream
of
life
the
gods
plucked
the
moon
and
the
stars
and
in
the
he
only
saw
black
sky
and
saw
the
lights
no
more
next
the
gods
took
from
him
for
their
vengeance
resteth
not
the
birds
and
butterflies
flowers
and
leaves
and
insects
and
all
small
things
and
the
prophet
looked
on
the
world
that
was
strangely
altered
yet
knew
not
of
the
anger
of
the
gods
then
the
gods
sent
away
his
familiar
hills
to
be
seen
no
more
by
him
and
all
the
pleasant
woodlands
on
their
summits
and
the
further
fields
and
in
a
narrower
world
ord
walked
round
and
round
now
seeing
little
and
his
soul
still
wandered
searching
for
some
gods
and
finding
none
lastly
the
gods
took
away
the
fields
and
stream
and
left
to
the
prophet
only
his
house
and
the
larger
things
that
were
in
it
day
by
day
they
crept
about
him
drawing
films
of
mist
between
him
and
familiar
things
till
at
last
he
beheld
nought
at
all
and
was
quite
blind
and
unaware
of
the
anger
of
the
gods
then
ord
world
became
only
a
world
of
sound
and
only
by
hearing
he
kept
his
hold
upon
things
all
the
profit
that
he
had
out
of
his
days
was
here
some
song
from
the
hills
or
there
the
voice
of
the
birds
and
sound
of
the
stream
or
the
drip
of
the
falling
rain
but
the
anger
of
the
gods
ceases
not
with
the
closing
of
flowers
nor
is
it
assuaged
by
all
the
winter
snows
nor
doth
it
rest
in
the
full
glare
of
summer
and
they
snatched
away
from
ord
one
night
his
world
of
sound
and
he
awoke
deaf
but
as
a
man
may
smite
away
the
hive
of
the
bee
and
the
bee
with
all
his
fellows
builds
again
knowing
not
what
hath
smitten
his
hive
or
that
it
shall
smite
again
so
ord
built
for
himself
a
world
out
of
old
memories
and
set
it
in
the
past
there
he
builded
himself
cities
out
of
former
joys
and
therein
built
palaces
of
mighty
things
achieved
and
with
his
memory
as
a
key
he
opened
golden
locks
and
had
still
a
world
to
live
in
though
the
gods
had
taken
from
him
the
world
of
sound
and
all
the
world
of
sight
but
the
gods
tire
not
from
pursuing
and
they
seized
his
world
of
former
things
and
took
his
memory
away
and
covered
up
the
paths
that
led
into
the
past
and
left
him
blind
and
deaf
and
forgetful
among
men
and
caused
all
men
to
know
that
this
was
he
who
once
had
said
that
the
gods
were
little
things
and
lastly
the
gods
took
his
soul
and
out
of
it
they
fashioned
the
south
wind
to
roam
the
seas
for
ever
and
not
have
rest
and
well
the
south
wind
knows
that
he
hath
once
understood
somewhere
and
long
ago
and
so
he
moans
to
the
islands
and
cries
along
southern
shores
i
have
known
and
i
have
known
but
all
things
sleep
when
the
south
wind
speaks
to
them
and
none
heed
his
cry
that
he
hath
known
but
are
rather
content
to
sleep
but
still
the
south
wind
knowing
that
there
is
something
that
he
hath
forgot
goes
on
crying
i
have
known
seeking
to
urge
men
to
arise
and
to
discover
it
but
none
heed
the
sorrows
of
the
south
wind
even
when
he
driveth
his
tears
out
of
the
south
so
that
though
the
south
wind
cries
on
and
on
and
never
findeth
rest
none
heed
that
there
is
aught
that
may
be
known
and
the
secret

the

thus
karnith
king
of
alatta
spake
to
his
eldest
son
i
bequeath
to
thee
my
city
of
zoon
with
its
golden
eaves
whereunder
hum
the
bees
and
i
bequeath
to
thee
also
the
land
of
alatta
and
all
such
other
lands
as
thou
art
worthy
to
possess
for
my
three
strong
armies
which
i
leave
thee
may
well
take
zindara
and
istahn
and
drive
back
onin
from
his
frontier
and
leaguer
the
walls
of
yan
and
beyond
that
spread
conquest
over
the
lesser
lands
of
hebith
ebnon
and
karida
only
lead
not
thine
armies
against
zeenar
nor
ever
cross
the
eidis
thereat
in
the
city
of
zoon
in
the
land
of
alatta
under
his
golden
eaves
died
king
karnith
and
his
soul
went
whither
had
gone
the
souls
of
his
sires
the
elder
kings
and
the
souls
of
their
slaves
then
karnith
zo
the
new
king
took
the
iron
crown
of
alatta
and
afterwards
went
down
to
the
plains
that
encircle
zoon
and
found
his
three
strong
armies
clamouring
to
be
led
against
zeenar
over
the
river
eidis
but
the
new
king
came
back
from
his
armies
and
all
one
night
in
the
great
palace
alone
with
his
iron
crown
pondered
long
upon
war
and
a
little
before
dawn
he
saw
dimly
through
his
palace
window
facing
east
over
the
city
of
zoon
and
across
the
fields
of
alatta
to
far
off
where
a
valley
opened
on
istahn
there
as
he
pondered
he
saw
the
smoke
arising
tall
and
straight
over
small
houses
in
the
plain
and
the
fields
where
the
sheep
fed
later
the
sun
rose
shining
over
alatta
as
it
shone
over
istahn
and
there
arose
a
stir
about
the
houses
both
in
alatta
and
istahn
and
cocks
crowded
in
the
city
and
men
went
out
into
the
fields
among
the
bleating
sheep
and
the
king
wondered
if
men
did
otherwise
in
istahn
and
men
and
women
met
as
they
went
out
to
work
and
the
sound
of
laughter
arose
from
streets
and
fields
the
king
eyes
gazed
into
the
distance
toward
istahn
and
still
the
smoke
went
upward
tall
and
straight
from
the
small
houses
and
the
sun
rose
higher
that
shone
upon
alatta
and
istahn
causing
the
flowers
to
open
wide
in
each
and
the
birds
to
sing
and
the
voices
of
men
and
women
to
arise
and
in
the
market
place
of
zoon
caravans
were
astir
that
set
out
to
carry
merchandise
to
istahn
and
afterwards
passed
camels
coming
to
alatta
with
many
tinkling
bells
all
this
the
king
saw
as
he
pondered
much
who
had
not
pondered
before
westward
the
agnid
mountains
frowned
in
the
distance
guarding
the
river
eidis
behind
them
the
fierce
people
of
zeenar
lived
in
a
bleak
land
later
the
king
going
abroad
through
his
new
kingdom
came
on
the
temple
of
the
gods
of
old
there
he
found
the
roof
shattered
and
the
marble
columns
broken
and
tall
weeds
met
together
in
the
inner
shrine
and
the
gods
of
old
bereft
of
worship
or
sacrifice
neglected
and
forgotten
and
the
king
asked
of
his
councillors
who
it
was
that
had
overturned
this
temple
of
the
gods
or
caused
the
gods
themselves
to
be
thus
forsaken
and
they
answered
him
time
has
done
this
next
the
king
came
upon
a
man
bent
and
crippled
whose
face
was
furrowed
and
worn
and
the
king
having
seen
no
such
sight
within
the
court
of
his
father
said
to
the
man
who
hath
done
this
thing
to
you
and
the
old
man
answered
time
hath
ruthlessly
done
it
but
the
king
and
his
councillors
went
on
and
next
they
came
upon
a
body
of
men
carrying
among
them
a
hearse
and
the
king
asked
his
councillors
closely
concerning
death
for
these
things
had
not
before
been
expounded
to
the
king
and
the
oldest
of
the
councillors
answered
death
o
king
is
a
gift
sent
by
the
gods
by
the
hand
of
their
servant
time
and
some
receive
it
gladly
and
some
are
forced
reluctantly
to
take
it
and
before
others
it
is
suddenly
flung
in
the
middle
of
the
day
and
with
this
gift
that
time
hath
brought
him
from
the
gods
a
man
must
go
forth
into
the
dark
to
possess
no
other
thing
for
so
long
as
the
gods
are
willing
but
the
king
went
back
to
his
palace
and
gathered
the
greatest
of
his
prophets
and
his
councillors
and
asked
them
more
particularly
concerning
time
and
they
told
the
king
how
that
time
was
a
great
figure
standing
like
a
tall
shadow
in
the
dusk
or
striding
unseen
across
the
world
and
how
that
he
was
the
slave
of
the
gods
and
did
their
bidding
but
ever
chose
new
masters
and
how
all
the
former
masters
of
time
were
dead
and
their
shrines
forgotten
and
one
said
i
have
seen
him
once
when
i
went
down
to
play
again
in
the
garden
of
my
childhood
because
of
certain
memories
and
it
was
towards
evening
and
the
light
was
pale
and
i
saw
time
standing
over
the
little
gate
pale
like
the
light
and
he
stood
between
me
and
that
garden
and
had
stolen
my
memories
because
he
was
mightier
than
i
and
another
said
i
too
have
seen
the
enemy
of
my
house
for
i
saw
him
when
he
strode
over
the
fields
that
i
knew
well
and
led
a
stranger
by
the
hand
to
place
him
in
my
home
to
sit
where
my
forefathers
sat
and
i
saw
him
afterwards
walk
thrice
round
the
house
and
stoop
and
gather
up
the
glamour
from
the
lawns
and
brush
aside
the
tall
poppies
in
the
garden
and
spread
weeds
in
his
pathway
where
he
strode
through
the
remembered
nooks
and
another
said
he
went
one
day
into
the
desert
and
brought
up
life
out
of
the
waste
places
and
made
it
cry
bitterly
and
covered
it
with
the
desert
again
and
another
said
i
too
saw
him
once
seated
in
the
garden
of
a
child
tearing
the
flowers
and
afterwards
he
went
away
through
many
woodlands
and
stooped
down
as
he
went
and
picked
the
leaves
one
by
one
from
the
trees
and
another
said
i
saw
him
once
by
moonlight
standing
tall
and
black
amidst
the
ruins
of
a
shrine
in
the
old
kingdom
of
amarna
doing
a
deed
by
night
and
he
wore
a
look
on
his
face
such
as
murderers
wear
as
he
busied
himself
to
cover
over
something
with
weeds
and
dust
thereafter
in
amarna
the
people
of
that
old
kingdom
missed
their
god
in
whose
shrine
i
saw
time
crouching
in
the
night
and
they
have
not
since
beheld
him
and
all
the
while
from
the
distance
at
the
city
edge
rose
a
hum
from
the
three
armies
of
the
king
clamouring
to
be
led
against
zeenar
thereat
the
king
went
down
to
his
three
armies
and
speaking
to
their
chiefs
said
i
will
not
go
down
clad
with
murder
to
be
king
over
other
lands
i
have
seen
the
same
morning
arising
on
istahn
that
also
gladdened
alatta
and
have
heard
peace
lowing
among
the
flowers
i
will
not
desolate
homes
to
rule
over
an
orphaned
land
and
a
land
widowed
but
i
will
lead
you
against
the
pledged
enemy
of
alatta
who
shall
crumble
the
towers
of
zoon
and
hath
gone
far
to
overthrow
our
gods
he
is
the
foe
of
zindara
and
istahn
and
yan
hebith
and
ebnon
may
not
overcome
him
nor
karida
be
safe
against
him
among
her
bleakest
mountains
he
is
a
foe
mightier
than
zeenar
with
frontiers
stronger
than
eidis
he
leers
at
all
the
peoples
of
the
earth
and
mocks
their
gods
and
covets
their
builded
cities
therefore
we
will
go
forth
and
conquer
time
and
save
the
gods
of
alatta
from
his
clutch
and
coming
back
victorious
shall
find
that
death
is
gone
and
age
and
illness
departed
and
here
we
shall
live
for
ever
by
the
golden
eaves
of
zoon
while
the
bees
hum
among
unrusted
gables
and
never
crumbling
towers
there
shall
be
neither
fading
nor
forgetting
nor
ever
dying
nor
sorrow
when
we
shall
have
freed
the
people
and
pleasant
fields
of
the
earth
from
inexorable
time
and
the
armies
swore
that
they
would
follow
the
king
to
save
the
world
and
the
gods
so
the
next
day
the
king
set
forth
with
his
three
armies
and
crossed
many
rivers
and
marched
through
many
lands
and
wherever
they
went
they
asked
for
news
of
time
and
the
first
day
they
met
a
woman
with
her
face
furrowed
and
lined
who
told
them
that
she
had
been
beautiful
and
that
time
had
smitten
her
in
the
face
with
his
five
claws
many
an
old
man
they
met
as
they
marched
in
search
of
time
all
had
seen
him
but
none
could
tell
them
more
except
that
some
said
he
went
that
way
and
pointed
to
a
ruined
tower
or
to
an
old
and
broken
tree
and
day
after
day
and
month
by
month
the
king
pushed
on
with
his
armies
hoping
to
come
at
last
on
time
sometimes
they
encamped
at
night
near
palaces
of
beautiful
design
or
beside
gardens
of
flowers
hoping
to
find
their
enemy
when
he
came
to
desecrate
in
the
dark
sometimes
they
came
on
cobwebs
sometimes
on
rusted
chains
and
houses
with
broken
roofs
or
crumbling
walls
then
the
armies
would
push
on
apace
thinking
that
they
were
closer
upon
the
track
of
time
as
the
weeks
passed
by
and
weeks
grew
to
months
and
always
they
heard
reports
and
rumours
of
time
but
never
found
him
the
armies
grew
weary
of
the
great
march
but
the
king
pushed
on
and
would
let
none
turn
back
saying
always
that
the
enemy
was
near
at
hand
month
in
month
out
the
king
led
on
his
now
unwilling
armies
till
at
last
they
had
marched
for
close
upon
a
year
and
came
to
the
village
of
astarma
very
far
to
the
north
there
many
of
the
king
weary
soldiers
deserted
from
his
armies
and
settled
down
in
astarma
and
married
astarmian
girls
by
these
soldiers
we
have
the
march
of
the
armies
clearly
chronicled
to
the
time
when
they
came
to
astarma
having
been
nigh
a
year
upon
the
march
and
the
army
left
that
village
and
the
children
cheered
them
as
they
went
up
the
street
and
five
miles
distant
they
passed
over
a
ridge
of
hills
and
out
of
sight
beyond
this
less
is
known
but
the
rest
of
this
chronicle
is
gathered
from
the
tales
that
the
veterans
of
the
king
armies
used
to
tell
in
the
evenings
about
the
fires
in
zoon
and
remembered
afterwards
by
the
men
of
zeenar
it
is
mostly
credited
in
these
days
that
such
of
the
king
armies
as
went
on
past
astarma
came
at
last
it
is
not
known
after
how
long
a
time
over
a
crest
of
a
slope
where
the
whole
earth
slanted
green
to
the
north
below
it
lay
green
fields
and
beyond
them
moaned
the
sea
with
never
shore
nor
island
so
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
among
the
green
fields
lay
a
village
and
on
this
village
the
eyes
of
the
king
and
his
armies
were
turned
as
they
came
down
the
slope
it
lay
beneath
them
grave
with
seared
antiquity
with
gables
stained
and
bent
by
the
lapse
of
frequent
years
with
all
its
chimneys
awry
its
roofs
were
tiled
with
antique
stones
covered
over
deep
with
moss
each
little
window
looked
with
a
myriad
strange
cut
panes
on
the
gardens
shaped
with
quaint
devices
and
overrun
with
weeds
on
rusted
hinges
the
doors
sung
to
and
fro
and
were
fashioned
of
planks
of
immemorial
oak
with
black
knots
gaping
from
their
sockets
against
it
all
there
beat
the
about
it
clambered
the
ivy
or
swayed
the
weeds
tall
and
straight
out
of
the
twisted
chimneys
arose
blue
columns
of
smoke
and
blades
of
grass
peeped
upward
between
the
huge
cobbles
of
the
unmolested
street
between
the
gardens
and
the
cobbled
streets
stood
hedges
higher
than
a
horseman
might
look
of
stalwart
thorn
and
upward
through
it
clambered
the
convolvulus
to
peer
into
the
garden
from
the
top
before
each
house
there
was
cut
a
gap
in
the
hedge
and
in
it
swung
a
wicket
gate
of
timber
soft
with
the
rain
and
years
and
green
like
the
moss
over
all
of
it
there
brooded
age
and
the
full
hush
of
things
bygone
and
forgotten
upon
this
derelict
that
the
years
had
cast
up
out
of
antiquity
the
king
and
his
armies
gazed
long
then
on
the
hill
slope
the
king
made
his
armies
halt
and
went
down
alone
with
one
of
his
chiefs
into
the
village
presently
there
was
a
stir
in
one
of
the
houses
and
a
bat
flew
out
of
the
door
into
the
daylight
and
three
mice
came
running
out
of
the
doorway
down
the
step
an
old
stone
cracked
in
two
and
held
together
by
moss
and
there
followed
an
old
man
bending
on
a
stick
with
a
white
beard
coming
to
the
ground
wearing
clothes
that
were
glossed
with
use
and
presently
there
came
others
out
of
the
other
houses
all
of
them
as
old
and
all
hobbling
on
sticks
these
were
the
oldest
people
that
the
king
had
ever
beheld
and
he
asked
them
the
name
of
the
village
and
who
they
were
and
one
of
them
answered
this
is
the
city
of
the
aged
in
the
territory
of
time
and
the
king
said
is
time
then
here
and
one
of
the
old
men
pointed
to
a
great
castle
standing
on
a
steep
hill
and
said
therein
dwells
time
and
we
are
his
people
and
they
all
looked
curiously
at
king
karnith
zo
and
the
eldest
of
the
villagers
spoke
again
and
said
whence
do
you
come
you
that
are
so
young
and
karnith
zo
told
him
how
he
had
come
to
conquer
time
to
save
the
world
and
the
gods
and
asked
them
whence
they
came
and
the
villagers
said
we
are
older
than
always
and
know
not
whence
we
came
but
we
are
the
people
of
time
and
here
from
the
edge
of
everything
he
sends
out
his
hours
to
assail
the
world
and
you
may
never
conquer
time
but
the
king
went
back
to
his
armies
and
pointed
towards
the
castle
on
the
hill
and
told
them
that
at
last
they
had
found
the
enemy
of
the
earth
and
they
that
were
older
than
always
went
back
slowly
into
their
houses
with
the
creaking
of
olden
doors
and
there
they
went
across
the
fields
and
passed
the
village
from
one
of
his
towers
time
eyed
them
all
the
while
and
in
battle
order
they
closed
in
on
the
steep
hill
as
time
sat
still
in
his
great
tower
and
watched
but
as
the
feet
of
the
foremost
touched
the
edge
of
the
hill
time
hurled
five
years
against
them
and
the
years
passed
over
their
heads
and
the
army
still
came
on
an
army
of
older
men
but
the
slope
seemed
steeper
to
the
king
and
to
every
man
in
his
army
and
they
breathed
more
heavily
and
time
summoned
up
more
years
and
one
by
one
he
hurled
them
at
karnith
zo
and
at
all
his
men
and
the
knees
of
the
army
stiffened
and
their
beards
grew
and
turned
grey
and
the
hours
and
days
and
the
months
went
singing
over
their
heads
and
their
hair
turned
whiter
and
whiter
and
the
conquering
hours
bore
down
and
the
years
rushed
on
and
swept
the
youth
of
that
army
clear
away
till
they
came
face
to
face
under
the
walls
of
the
castle
of
time
with
a
mass
of
howling
years
and
found
the
top
of
the
slope
too
steep
for
aged
men
slowly
and
painfully
harassed
with
agues
and
chills
the
king
rallied
his
aged
army
that
tottered
down
the
slope
slowly
the
king
led
back
his
warriors
over
whose
heads
had
shrieked
the
triumphant
years
year
in
year
out
they
straggled
southwards
always
towards
zoon
they
came
with
rust
upon
their
spears
and
long
beards
flowing
again
into
astarma
and
none
knew
them
there
they
passed
again
by
towns
and
villages
where
once
they
had
inquired
curiously
concerning
time
and
none
knew
them
there
either
they
came
again
to
the
palaces
and
gardens
where
they
had
waited
for
time
in
the
night
and
found
that
time
had
been
there
and
all
the
while
they
set
a
hope
before
them
that
they
should
come
on
zoon
again
and
see
its
golden
eaves
and
no
one
knew
that
unperceived
behind
them
there
lurked
and
followed
the
gaunt
figure
of
time
cutting
off
stragglers
one
by
one
and
overwhelming
them
with
his
hours
only
men
were
missed
from
the
army
every
day
and
fewer
and
fewer
grew
the
veterans
of
karnith
zo
but
at
last
after
many
a
month
one
night
as
they
marched
in
the
dusk
before
the
morning
dawn
suddenly
ascending
shone
on
the
eaves
of
zoon
and
a
great
cry
ran
through
the
army
alatta
alatta
but
drawing
nearer
they
found
that
the
gates
were
rusted
and
weeds
grew
tall
along
the
outer
walls
many
a
roof
had
fallen
gables
were
blackened
and
bent
and
the
golden
eaves
shone
not
as
heretofore
and
the
soldiers
entering
the
city
expecting
to
find
their
sisters
and
sweethearts
of
a
few
years
ago
saw
only
old
women
wrinkled
with
great
age
and
knew
not
who
they
were
suddenly
someone
said
he
has
been
here
too
and
then
they
knew
that
while
they
searched
for
time
time
had
gone
forth
against
their
city
and
leaguered
it
with
the
years
and
had
taken
it
while
they
were
far
away
and
enslaved
their
women
and
children
with
the
yoke
of
age
so
all
that
remained
of
the
three
armies
of
karnith
zo
settled
in
the
conquered
city
and
presently
the
men
of
zeenar
crossed
over
the
river
eidis
and
easily
conquering
an
army
of
aged
men
took
all
alatta
for
themselves
and
their
kings
reigned
thereafter
in
the
city
of
zoon
and
sometimes
the
men
of
zeenar
listened
to
the
strange
tales
that
the
old
alattans
told
of
the
years
when
they
made
battle
against
time
such
of
these
tales
as
the
men
of
zeenar
remembered
they
afterwards
set
forth
and
this
is
all
that
may
be
told
of
those
adventurous
armies
that
went
to
war
with
time
to
save
the
world
and
the
gods
and
were
overwhelmed
by
the
hours
and
the
years
the
relenting
of
sarnidac
the
lame
boy
sarnidac
tended
sheep
on
a
hill
to
the
southward
of
the
city
sarnidac
was
a
dwarf
and
greatly
derided
in
the
city
for
the
women
said
it
is
very
funny
that
sarnidac
is
a
dwarf
and
they
would
point
their
fingers
at
him
saying
this
is
sarnidac
he
is
a
dwarf
also
he
is
very
lame
once
the
doors
of
all
the
temples
in
the
world
swung
open
to
the
morning
and
sarnidac
with
his
sheep
upon
the
hill
saw
strange
figures
going
down
the
white
road
always
southwards
all
the
morning
he
saw
the
dust
rising
above
the
strange
figures
and
always
they
went
southwards
right
as
far
as
the
rim
of
the
nydoon
hills
where
the
white
road
could
be
seen
no
more
and
the
figures
stooped
and
seemed
to
be
larger
than
men
but
all
men
seemed
very
large
to
sarnidac
and
he
could
not
see
clearly
through
the
dust
and
sarnidac
shouted
to
them
as
he
hailed
all
people
that
passed
down
the
long
white
road
and
none
of
the
figures
looked
to
left
or
right
and
none
of
them
turned
to
answer
sarnidac
but
then
few
people
ever
answered
him
because
he
was
lame
and
a
small
dwarf
still
the
figures
went
striding
swiftly
stooping
forward
through
the
dust
till
at
last
sarnidac
came
running
down
his
hill
to
watch
them
closer
as
he
came
to
the
white
road
the
last
of
the
figures
passed
him
and
sarnidac
ran
limping
behind
him
down
the
road
for
sarnidac
was
weary
of
the
city
wherein
all
derided
him
and
when
he
saw
these
figures
all
hurrying
away
he
thought
that
they
went
perhaps
to
some
other
city
beyond
the
hills
over
which
the
sun
shone
brighter
or
where
there
was
more
food
for
he
was
poor
even
perhaps
where
people
had
not
the
custom
of
laughing
at
sarnidac
so
this
procession
of
figures
that
stooped
and
seemed
larger
than
men
went
southward
down
the
road
and
a
lame
dwarf
hobbled
behind
them
khamazan
now
called
the
city
of
the
last
of
temples
lies
southward
of
the
nydoon
hills
this
is
the
story
of
pompeides
now
chief
prophet
of
the
only
temple
in
the
world
and
greatest
of
all
the
prophets
that
have
been
on
the
slopes
of
nydoon
i
was
seated
once
above
khamazan
there
i
saw
figures
in
the
morning
striding
through
much
dust
along
the
road
that
leads
across
the
world
striding
up
the
hill
they
came
towards
me
not
with
the
gait
of
men
and
soon
the
first
one
came
to
the
crest
of
the
hill
where
the
road
dips
to
find
the
plains
again
where
lies
khamazan
and
now
i
swear
by
all
the
gods
that
are
gone
that
this
thing
happened
as
i
shall
say
it
and
was
surely
so
when
those
that
came
striding
up
the
hill
came
to
its
summit
they
took
not
the
road
that
goes
down
into
the
plains
nor
trod
the
dust
any
longer
but
went
straight
on
and
upwards
striding
as
they
strode
before
as
though
the
hill
had
not
ended
nor
the
road
dipped
and
they
strode
as
though
they
trod
no
yielding
substance
yet
they
stepped
upwards
through
the
air
this
the
gods
did
for
they
were
not
born
men
who
strode
that
day
so
strangely
away
from
earth
but
i
when
i
saw
this
thing
when
already
three
had
passed
me
leaving
earth
cried
out
before
the
fourth
of
my
childhood
guardians
of
little
homes
whither
are
ye
going
leaving
the
round
earth
to
swim
alone
and
forgotten
in
so
great
a
waste
of
sky
and
one
answered
apace
shoots
her
fierce
glare
over
the
world
and
men
faith
grows
dim
and
the
gods
go
men
shall
make
iron
gods
and
gods
of
steel
when
the
wind
and
the
ivy
meet
within
the
shrines
of
the
temples
of
the
gods
of
old
and
i
left
that
place
as
a
man
leaves
fire
by
night
and
going
plainwards
down
the
white
road
that
the
gods
spurned
cried
out
to
all
that
i
passed
to
follow
me
and
so
crying
came
to
the
city
gates
and
there
i
shouted
to
all
near
the
gates
yonder
hilltop
the
gods
are
leaving
earth
then
i
gathered
many
and
we
all
hastened
to
the
hill
to
pray
the
gods
to
tarry
and
there
we
cried
out
to
the
last
of
the
departing
gods
of
old
prophecy
and
of
men
hopes
leave
not
the
earth
and
all
our
worship
shall
hum
about
your
ears
as
never
it
hath
before
and
oft
the
sacrifice
shall
squeal
upon
your
altars
and
i
said
of
still
evenings
and
quiet
nights
go
not
from
earth
and
leave
not
your
carven
shrines
and
all
men
shall
worship
you
still
for
between
us
and
yonder
still
blue
spaces
oft
roam
the
thunder
and
the
storms
there
in
his
hiding
lurks
the
dark
eclipse
and
there
are
stored
all
snows
and
hails
and
lightnings
that
shall
vex
the
earth
for
a
million
years
gods
of
our
hopes
how
shall
men
prayers
crying
from
empty
shrines
pass
through
such
terrible
spaces
how
shall
they
ever
fare
above
the
thunder
and
many
storms
to
whatever
place
the
gods
may
go
in
that
blue
waste
beyond
but
the
gods
bent
straight
forward
and
trampled
through
the
sky
and
looked
not
to
the
right
nor
left
nor
downwards
nor
ever
heeded
my
prayer
and
one
cried
out
hoping
yet
to
stay
the
gods
though
nearly
all
were
gone
saying
gods
rob
not
the
earth
of
the
dim
hush
that
hangs
round
all
your
temples
bereave
not
all
the
world
of
old
romance
take
not
the
glamour
from
the
moonlight
nor
tear
the
wonder
out
of
the
white
mists
in
every
land
for
o
ye
gods
of
the
childhood
of
the
world
when
you
have
left
the
earth
you
shall
have
taken
the
mystery
from
the
sea
and
all
its
glory
from
antiquity
and
you
shall
have
wrenched
out
hope
from
the
dim
future
there
shall
be
no
strange
cries
at
night
time
half
understood
nor
songs
in
the
twilight
and
the
whole
of
the
wonder
shall
have
died
with
last
year
flowers
in
little
gardens
or
leaning
south
for
with
the
gods
must
go
the
enchantment
of
the
plains
and
all
the
magic
of
dark
woods
and
something
shall
be
lacking
from
the
quiet
of
early
dawn
for
it
would
scarce
befit
the
gods
to
leave
the
earth
and
not
take
with
them
that
which
they
had
given
it
out
beyond
the
still
blue
spaces
ye
will
need
the
holiness
of
sunset
for
yourselves
and
little
sacred
memories
and
the
thrill
that
is
in
stories
told
by
firesides
long
ago
one
strain
of
music
one
song
one
line
of
poetry
and
one
kiss
and
a
memory
of
one
pool
with
rushes
and
each
one
the
best
shall
the
gods
take
to
whom
the
best
belongs
when
the
gods
go
a
lamentation
people
of
khamazan
sing
a
lamentation
for
all
the
children
of
earth
at
the
feet
of
the
departing
gods
sing
a
lamentation
for
the
children
of
earth
who
now
must
carry
their
prayers
to
empty
shrines
and
around
empty
shrines
must
rest
at
last
then
when
our
prayers
were
ended
and
our
tears
shed
we
beheld
the
last
and
smallest
of
the
gods
halted
upon
the
hilltop
twice
he
called
to
them
with
a
cry
somewhat
like
the
cry
wherewith
our
shepherds
hail
their
brethren
and
long
gazed
after
them
and
then
deigned
to
look
no
longer
and
to
tarry
upon
earth
and
turn
his
eyes
on
men
then
a
great
shout
went
up
when
we
saw
that
our
hopes
were
saved
and
that
there
was
still
on
earth
a
haven
for
our
prayers
smaller
than
men
now
seemed
the
figures
that
had
loomed
so
big
as
one
behind
the
other
far
over
our
heads
they
still
strode
upwards
but
the
small
god
that
had
pitied
the
world
came
with
us
down
the
hill
still
deigning
to
tread
the
road
though
strangely
not
as
men
tread
and
into
khamazan
there
we
housed
him
in
the
palace
of
the
king
for
that
was
before
the
building
of
the
temple
of
gold
and
the
king
made
sacrifice
before
him
with
his
own
hands
and
he
that
had
pitied
the
world
did
eat
the
flesh
of
the
sacrifice
and
the
book
of
the
knowledge
of
the
gods
in
khamazan
tells
how
the
small
god
that
pitied
the
world
told
his
prophets
that
his
name
was
sarnidac
and
that
he
herded
sheep
and
that
therefore
he
is
called
the
shepherd
god
and
sheep
are
sacrificed
upon
his
altars
thrice
a
day
and
the
north
east
west
and
the
south
are
the
four
hurdles
of
sarnidac
and
the
white
clouds
are
his
sheep
and
the
book
of
the
knowledge
of
the
gods
tells
further
how
the
day
on
which
pompeides
found
the
gods
shall
be
kept
for
ever
as
a
fast
until
the
evening
and
called
the
fast
of
the
departing
but
in
the
evening
shall
a
feast
be
held
which
is
named
the
feast
of
the
relenting
for
on
that
evening
sarnidac
pitied
the
whole
world
and
tarried
and
the
people
of
khamazan
all
prayed
to
sarnidac
and
dreamed
their
dreams
and
hoped
their
hopes
because
their
temple
was
not
empty
whether
the
gods
that
are
departed
be
greater
than
sarnidac
none
know
in
khamazan
but
some
believe
that
in
their
azure
windows
they
have
set
lights
that
lost
prayers
swarming
upwards
may
come
to
them
like
moths
and
at
last
find
haven
and
light
far
up
above
the
evening
and
the
stillness
where
sit
the
gods
but
sarnidac
wondered
at
the
strange
figures
at
the
people
of
khamazan
and
at
the
palace
of
the
king
and
the
customs
of
the
prophets
but
wondered
not
more
greatly
at
aught
in
khamazan
than
he
had
wondered
at
the
city
which
he
had
left
for
sarnidac
who
had
not
known
why
men
were
unkind
to
him
thought
that
he
had
found
at
last
the
land
for
which
the
gods
had
let
him
hope
where
men
should
have
the
custom
of
being
kind
to
sarnidac
the
jest
of
the
gods
once
the
older
gods
had
need
of
laughter
therefore
they
made
the
soul
of
a
king
and
set
in
it
ambitions
greater
than
kings
should
have
and
lust
for
territories
beyond
the
lust
of
other
kings
and
in
this
soul
they
set
strength
beyond
the
strength
of
others
and
fierce
desire
for
power
and
a
strong
pride
then
the
gods
pointed
earthward
and
sent
that
soul
into
the
fields
of
men
to
live
in
the
body
of
a
slave
and
the
slave
grew
and
the
pride
and
lust
for
power
began
to
arise
in
his
heart
and
he
wore
shackles
on
his
arms
then
in
the
fields
of
twilight
the
gods
prepared
to
laugh
but
the
slave
went
down
to
the
shore
of
the
great
sea
and
cast
his
body
away
and
the
shackles
that
were
upon
it
and
strode
back
to
the
fields
of
twilight
and
stood
up
before
the
gods
and
looked
them
in
their
faces
this
thing
the
gods
when
they
had
prepared
to
laugh
had
not
foreseen
lust
for
power
burned
strong
in
that
king
soul
and
there
was
all
the
strength
and
pride
in
it
that
the
gods
had
placed
therein
and
he
was
too
strong
for
the
older
gods
he
whose
body
had
borne
the
lashes
of
men
could
brook
no
longer
the
dominion
of
the
gods
and
standing
before
them
he
bade
the
gods
to
go
up
to
their
lips
leapt
all
the
anger
of
the
older
gods
being
for
the
first
time
commanded
but
the
king
soul
faced
them
still
and
their
anger
died
away
and
they
averted
their
eyes
then
their
thrones
became
empty
and
the
fields
of
twilight
bare
as
the
gods
slunk
far
away
but
the
soul
chose
new
companions
the
dreams
of
the
prophet
when
the
gods
drave
me
forth
to
toil
and
assailed
me
with
thirst
and
beat
me
down
with
hunger
then
i
prayed
to
the
gods
when
the
gods
smote
the
cities
wherein
i
dwelt
and
when
their
anger
scorched
me
and
their
eyes
burned
then
did
i
praise
the
gods
and
offer
sacrifice
but
when
i
came
again
to
my
green
land
and
found
that
all
was
gone
and
the
old
mysterious
haunts
wherein
i
prayed
as
a
child
were
gone
and
when
the
gods
tore
up
the
dust
and
even
the
spider
web
from
the
last
remembered
nook
then
did
i
curse
the
gods
speaking
it
to
their
faces
saying
gods
of
my
prayers
gods
of
my
sacrifice
because
ye
have
forgotten
the
sacred
places
of
my
childhood
and
they
have
therefore
ceased
to
be
yet
may
i
not
forget
because
ye
have
done
this
thing
ye
shall
see
cold
altars
and
shall
lack
both
my
fear
and
praise
i
shall
not
wince
at
your
lightnings
nor
be
awed
when
ye
go
by
then
looking
seawards
i
stood
and
cursed
the
gods
and
at
this
moment
there
came
to
me
one
in
the
garb
of
a
poet
who
said
curse
not
the
gods
and
i
said
to
him
wherefore
should
i
not
curse
those
that
have
stolen
my
sacred
places
in
the
night
and
trodden
down
the
gardens
of
my
childhood
and
he
said
come
and
i
will
show
thee
and
i
followed
him
to
where
two
camels
stood
with
their
faces
towards
the
desert
and
we
set
out
and
i
travelled
with
him
for
a
great
space
he
speaking
never
a
word
and
so
we
came
at
last
to
a
waste
valley
hid
in
the
desert
midst
and
herein
like
fallen
moons
i
saw
vast
ribs
that
stood
up
white
out
of
the
sand
higher
than
the
hills
of
the
desert
and
here
and
there
lay
the
enormous
shapes
of
skulls
like
the
white
marble
domes
of
palaces
built
for
tyrannous
kings
a
long
while
since
by
armies
of
driven
slaves
also
there
lay
in
the
desert
other
bones
the
bones
of
vast
legs
and
arms
against
which
the
desert
like
a
besieging
sea
ever
advanced
and
already
had
half
drowned
and
as
i
gazed
in
wonder
at
these
colossal
things
the
poet
said
to
me
the
gods
are
dead
and
i
gazed
long
in
silence
and
i
said
these
fingers
that
are
now
so
dead
and
so
very
white
and
still
tore
once
the
flowers
in
gardens
of
my
youth
but
my
companion
said
to
me
i
have
brought
thee
here
to
ask
of
thee
thy
forgiveness
of
the
gods
for
i
being
a
poet
knew
the
gods
and
would
fain
drive
off
the
curses
that
hover
above
their
bones
and
bring
them
men
forgiveness
as
an
offering
at
the
last
that
the
weeds
and
the
ivy
may
cover
their
bones
from
the
sun
and
i
said
they
made
remorse
with
his
fur
grey
like
a
rainy
evening
in
the
autumn
with
many
rending
claws
and
pain
with
his
hot
hands
and
lingering
feet
and
fear
like
a
rat
with
two
cold
teeth
carved
each
out
of
the
ice
of
either
pole
and
anger
with
the
swift
flight
of
the
dragonfly
in
summer
having
burning
eyes
i
will
not
forgive
these
gods
but
the
poet
said
canst
thou
be
angry
with
these
beautiful
white
bones
and
i
looked
long
at
those
curved
and
beautiful
bones
that
were
no
longer
able
to
hurt
the
smallest
creature
in
all
the
worlds
that
they
had
made
and
i
thought
long
of
the
evil
that
they
had
done
and
also
of
the
good
but
when
i
thought
of
their
great
hands
coming
red
and
wet
from
battles
to
make
a
primrose
for
a
child
to
pick
then
i
forgave
the
gods
and
a
gentle
rain
came
falling
out
of
heaven
and
stilled
the
restless
sand
and
a
soft
green
moss
grew
suddenly
and
covered
the
bones
till
they
looked
like
strange
green
hills
and
i
heard
a
cry
and
awoke
and
found
that
i
had
dreamed
and
looking
out
of
my
house
into
the
street
i
found
that
a
flash
of
lightning
had
killed
a
child
then
i
knew
that
the
gods
still
lived
i
lay
asleep
in
the
poppy
fields
of
the
gods
in
the
valley
of
alderon
where
the
gods
come
by
night
to
meet
together
in
council
when
the
moon
is
low
and
i
dreamed
that
this
was
the
secret
fate
and
chance
had
played
their
game
and
ended
and
all
was
over
all
the
hopes
and
tears
regrets
desires
and
sorrows
things
that
men
wept
for
and
unremembered
things
and
kingdoms
and
little
gardens
and
the
sea
and
the
worlds
and
the
moons
and
the
suns
and
what
remained
was
nothing
having
neither
colour
nor
sound
then
said
fate
to
chance
let
us
play
our
old
game
again
and
they
played
it
again
together
using
the
gods
as
pieces
as
they
had
played
it
oft
before
so
that
those
things
which
have
been
shall
all
be
again
and
under
the
same
bank
in
the
same
land
a
sudden
glare
of
singlight
on
the
same
spring
day
shall
bring
the
same
daffodil
to
bloom
once
more
and
the
same
child
shall
pick
it
and
not
regretted
shall
be
the
billion
years
that
fell
between
and
the
same
old
faces
shall
be
seen
again
yet
not
bereaved
of
their
familiar
haunts
and
you
and
i
shall
in
a
garden
meet
again
upon
an
afternoon
in
summer
when
the
sun
stands
midway
between
his
zenith
and
the
sea
where
we
met
oft
before
for
fate
and
chance
play
but
one
game
together
with
every
move
the
same
and
they
play
it
oft
to
while
eternity
away
part
ii
the
journey
of
the
king
one
day
the
king
turned
to
the
women
that
danced
and
said
to
them
dance
no
more
and
those
that
bore
the
wine
in
jewelled
cups
he
sent
away
the
palace
of
king
ebalon
was
emptied
of
sound
of
song
and
there
rose
the
voices
of
heralds
crying
in
the
streets
to
find
the
prophets
of
the
land
then
went
the
dancers
the
cupbearer
and
the
singers
down
into
the
hard
streets
among
the
houses
pattering
leaves
silvern
fountain
and
summer
lightning
the
dancers
whose
feet
the
gods
had
not
devised
for
stony
ways
which
had
only
danced
for
princes
and
with
them
went
the
singer
soul
of
the
south
and
the
sweet
singer
dream
of
the
sea
whose
voices
the
gods
had
attuned
to
the
ears
of
kings
and
old
istahn
the
cupbearer
left
his
life
work
in
the
palace
to
tread
the
common
ways
he
that
had
stood
at
the
elbows
of
three
kings
of
zarkandhu
and
had
watched
his
ancient
vintage
feeding
their
valour
and
mirth
as
the
waters
of
tondaris
feed
the
green
plains
to
the
south
ever
he
had
stood
grave
among
their
jests
but
his
heart
warmed
itself
solely
by
the
fire
of
the
mirth
of
kings
he
too
with
the
singers
and
dancers
went
out
into
the
dark
and
throughout
the
land
the
heralds
sought
out
the
prophets
thereof
then
one
evening
as
king
ebalon
sat
alone
within
his
palace
there
were
brought
before
him
all
who
had
repute
for
wisdom
and
who
wrote
the
histories
of
the
times
to
be
then
the
king
spake
saying
the
king
goeth
upon
a
journey
with
many
horses
yet
riding
upon
none
when
the
pomp
of
travelling
shall
be
heard
in
the
streets
and
the
sound
of
the
lute
and
the
drum
and
the
name
of
the
king
and
i
would
know
what
princes
and
what
people
shall
greet
me
on
the
other
shore
in
the
land
to
which
i
travel
then
fell
a
hush
upon
the
prophets
for
they
murmured
all
knowledge
is
with
the
king
then
said
the
king
thou
first
samahn
high
prophet
of
the
temple
of
gold
in
azinorn
answer
or
thou
shalt
write
no
more
the
history
of
the
times
to
be
but
shalt
toil
with
thy
hand
to
make
record
of
the
little
happenings
of
the
days
that
were
as
do
the
common
men
then
said
samahn
all
knowledge
is
with
the
king
and
when
the
pomp
of
travelling
shall
be
heard
in
the
streets
and
the
slow
horses
whereon
the
king
rideth
not
go
behind
lute
and
drum
then
as
the
king
well
knoweth
thou
shalt
go
down
to
the
great
white
house
of
kings
and
entering
the
portals
where
none
are
worthy
to
follow
shalt
make
obeisance
alone
to
all
the
elder
kings
of
zarkandhu
whose
bones
are
seated
upon
golden
thrones
grasping
their
sceptres
still
therein
thou
shalt
go
with
robes
and
sceptre
through
the
marble
porch
but
thou
shalt
leave
behind
thee
thy
gleaming
crown
that
others
may
wear
it
and
as
the
times
go
by
come
in
to
swell
the
number
of
the
thirty
kings
that
sit
in
the
great
white
house
on
golden
thrones
there
is
one
doorway
in
the
great
white
house
and
it
stands
wide
with
marble
portals
yawning
for
kings
but
when
it
shall
receive
thee
and
thine
obeisance
hath
been
made
because
of
thine
obligation
to
the
thirty
kings
thou
shalt
find
at
the
back
of
the
house
an
unknown
door
through
which
the
soul
of
a
king
may
just
pass
and
leaving
thy
bones
upon
a
golden
throne
thou
shalt
go
unseen
out
of
the
great
white
house
to
tread
the
velvet
spaces
that
lie
among
the
worlds
then
o
king
it
were
well
to
travel
fast
and
not
to
tarry
about
the
houses
of
men
as
do
the
souls
of
some
who
still
bewail
the
sudden
murder
that
sent
them
upon
the
journey
before
their
time
and
who
being
yet
both
to
go
linger
in
dark
chambers
all
the
night
these
setting
forth
to
travel
in
the
dawn
and
travelling
all
the
day
see
earth
behind
them
gleaming
when
an
evening
falls
and
again
are
loth
to
leave
its
pleasant
haunts
and
come
back
again
through
dark
woods
and
up
into
some
old
loved
chamber
and
ever
tarry
between
home
and
flight
and
find
no
rest
thou
wilt
set
forth
at
once
because
the
journey
is
far
and
lasts
for
many
hours
but
the
hours
on
the
velvet
spaces
are
the
hours
of
the
gods
and
we
may
not
say
what
time
such
an
hour
may
be
if
reckoned
in
mortal
years
at
last
thou
shalt
come
to
a
grey
place
filled
with
mist
with
grey
shapes
standing
before
it
which
are
altars
and
on
the
altars
rise
small
red
flames
from
dying
fires
that
scarce
illumine
the
mist
and
in
the
mist
it
is
dark
and
cold
because
the
fires
are
low
these
are
the
altars
of
the
people
faiths
and
the
flames
are
the
worship
of
men
and
through
the
mist
the
gods
of
old
go
groping
in
the
dark
and
in
the
cold
there
thou
shalt
hear
a
voice
cry
feebly
inyani
inyani
lord
of
the
thunder
where
art
thou
for
i
can
not
see
and
a
voice
shall
answer
faintly
in
the
cold
o
maker
of
many
worlds
i
am
here
and
in
that
place
the
gods
of
old
are
nearly
deaf
for
the
prayers
of
men
grow
few
they
are
nigh
blind
because
the
fires
burn
low
upon
the
altars
of
men
faiths
and
they
are
very
cold
and
all
about
the
place
of
mist
there
lies
a
moaning
sea
which
is
called
the
sea
of
souls
and
behind
the
place
of
mist
are
the
dim
shapes
of
mountains
and
on
the
peak
of
one
there
glows
a
silvern
light
that
shines
in
the
moaning
sea
and
ever
as
the
flames
on
the
altars
die
before
the
gods
of
old
the
light
on
the
mountain
increases
and
the
light
shines
over
the
mist
and
never
through
it
as
the
gods
of
old
grow
blind
it
is
said
that
the
light
on
the
mountain
shall
one
day
become
a
new
god
who
is
not
of
the
gods
of
old
there
o
king
thou
shalt
enter
the
sea
of
souls
by
the
shore
where
the
altars
stand
which
are
covered
in
mist
in
that
sea
are
the
souls
of
all
that
ever
lived
on
the
worlds
and
all
that
ever
shall
live
all
freed
from
earth
and
flesh
and
all
the
souls
in
that
sea
are
aware
of
one
another
but
more
than
with
hearing
or
sight
or
by
taste
or
touch
or
smell
and
they
all
speak
to
each
other
yet
not
with
lips
with
voices
which
need
no
sound
and
over
the
sea
lies
music
as
winds
an
ocean
on
earth
and
there
unfettered
by
language
great
thoughts
set
outward
through
the
souls
as
on
earth
the
currents
go
once
did
i
dream
that
in
a
ship
i
sailed
upon
that
sea
and
heard
the
music
that
is
not
of
instruments
and
voices
not
from
lips
and
woke
and
found
that
i
was
upon
the
earth
and
that
the
gods
had
lied
to
me
in
the
night
into
this
sea
from
fields
of
battle
and
cities
come
down
the
rivers
of
lives
and
ever
the
gods
have
taken
onyx
cups
and
far
and
wide
into
the
worlds
again
have
flung
the
souls
out
of
the
sea
that
each
soul
may
find
a
prison
in
the
body
of
a
man
with
five
small
windows
closely
barred
and
each
one
shackled
with
forgetfulness
but
all
the
while
the
light
on
the
mountain
grows
and
none
may
say
what
work
the
god
that
shall
be
born
of
the
silvern
light
shall
work
on
the
sea
of
souls
when
the
gods
of
old
are
dead
and
the
sea
is
living
still
and
answer
made
the
king
thou
that
art
a
prophet
of
the
gods
of
old
go
back
and
see
that
those
red
flames
burn
more
brightly
on
the
altars
in
the
mist
for
the
gods
of
old
are
easy
and
pleasant
gods
and
thou
canst
not
say
what
toil
shall
vex
our
souls
when
the
god
of
the
light
on
the
mountain
shall
stride
along
the
shore
where
bleach
the
huge
bones
of
the
gods
of
old
and
samahn
answered
all
knowledge
is
with
the
king
then
the
king
called
to
ynath
bidding
him
speak
concerning
the
journey
of
the
king
ynath
was
the
prophet
that
sat
at
the
eastern
gate
of
the
temple
of
gorandhu
there
ynath
prayed
his
prayers
to
all
the
passers
by
lest
ever
the
gods
should
go
abroad
and
one
should
pass
him
dressed
in
mortal
guise
and
men
are
pleased
as
they
walk
by
that
eastern
gate
that
ynath
should
pray
to
them
for
fear
that
they
be
gods
so
men
bring
gifts
to
ynath
in
the
eastern
gate
and
ynath
said
all
knowledge
is
with
the
king
when
a
strange
ship
comes
to
anchor
in
the
air
outside
thy
chamber
window
thou
shalt
leave
thy
garden
and
it
shall
become
a
prey
to
the
nights
and
days
and
be
covered
again
with
grass
but
going
aboard
thou
shalt
set
sail
over
the
sea
of
time
and
well
shall
the
ship
steer
through
the
many
worlds
and
still
sail
on
if
other
ships
shall
pass
thee
on
the
way
and
hail
thee
saying
what
port
thou
shalt
answer
them
earth
and
if
they
ask
thee
bound
then
thou
shalt
answer
end
or
thou
shalt
hail
them
saying
what
port
and
they
shall
answer
the
end
called
also
the
beginning
and
bound
to
earth
and
thou
shalt
sail
away
till
like
an
old
sorrow
dimly
felt
by
happy
men
the
worlds
shall
gleam
in
the
distance
like
one
star
and
as
the
star
pales
thou
shalt
come
to
the
shore
of
space
where
aeons
rolling
shorewards
from
time
sea
shall
lash
up
centuries
to
foam
away
in
years
there
lies
the
centre
garden
of
the
gods
facing
full
seawards
all
around
lie
songs
that
on
earth
were
never
sung
fair
thoughts
not
heard
among
the
worlds
dream
pictures
never
seen
that
drifted
over
time
without
a
home
till
at
last
the
aeons
swept
them
on
to
the
shore
of
space
and
in
the
centre
garden
of
the
gods
bloom
many
fancies
therein
once
some
souls
were
playing
where
the
gods
walked
up
and
down
and
to
and
fro
and
a
dream
came
in
more
beauteous
than
the
rest
on
the
crest
of
a
wave
of
time
and
one
soul
going
downward
to
the
shore
clutched
at
the
dream
and
caught
it
then
over
the
dreams
and
stories
and
old
songs
that
lay
on
the
shore
of
space
the
hours
came
sweeping
back
and
the
centuries
caught
that
soul
and
swirled
him
with
his
dream
far
out
to
the
sea
of
time
and
the
aeons
swept
him
earthwards
and
cast
him
into
a
palace
with
all
the
might
of
the
sea
and
left
him
there
with
his
dream
the
child
grew
to
a
king
and
still
clutched
at
his
dream
till
the
people
wondered
and
laughed
then
o
king
thou
didst
cast
thy
dream
back
into
the
sea
and
time
drowned
it
and
men
laughed
no
more
but
thou
didst
forget
that
a
certain
sea
beat
on
a
distant
shore
and
that
there
was
a
garden
and
therein
souls
but
at
the
end
of
the
journey
that
thou
shalt
take
when
thou
comest
to
the
shore
of
space
again
thou
shalt
go
up
the
beach
and
coming
to
a
garden
gate
that
stands
in
a
garden
wall
shalt
remember
these
things
again
for
it
stands
where
the
hours
assail
not
above
the
beating
of
time
far
up
the
shore
and
nothing
altereth
there
so
thou
shalt
go
through
the
garden
gate
and
hear
again
the
whispering
of
the
souls
when
they
talk
low
where
sing
the
voices
of
the
gods
there
with
kindred
souls
thou
shalt
speak
as
thou
didst
of
yore
and
tell
them
what
befell
thee
beyond
the
tides
of
time
and
how
they
took
thee
and
made
of
thee
a
king
so
that
thy
soul
found
no
rest
there
in
the
centre
garden
thou
shalt
sit
at
ease
and
watch
the
gods
all
go
up
and
down
and
to
and
fro
on
the
paths
of
dreams
and
songs
and
shalt
not
venture
down
to
the
cheerless
sea
for
that
which
a
man
loves
most
is
not
on
this
side
of
time
and
all
which
drifts
on
its
aeons
is
a
lure
all
knowledge
is
with
the
king
then
said
the
king
ay
there
was
a
dream
once
but
time
hath
swept
it
away
then
spake
monith
prophet
of
the
temple
of
azure
that
stands
on
the
of
ahmoon
and
said
all
knowledge
is
with
the
king
once
thou
didst
set
out
upon
a
one
day
journey
riding
thy
horse
and
before
thee
had
gone
a
beggar
down
the
road
and
his
name
was
yeb
him
thou
didst
overtake
and
when
he
heeded
not
thy
coming
thou
didst
ride
over
him
upon
the
journey
that
thou
shalt
one
day
take
riding
upon
no
horse
this
beggar
has
set
out
before
thee
and
is
labouring
up
the
crystal
steps
towards
the
moon
as
a
man
goeth
up
the
steps
of
a
high
tower
in
the
dark
on
the
moon
edge
beneath
the
shadow
of
mount
angises
he
shall
rest
awhile
and
then
shall
climb
the
crystal
steps
again
then
a
great
journey
lies
before
him
before
he
may
rest
again
till
he
come
to
that
star
that
is
called
the
left
eye
of
gundo
then
a
journey
of
many
crystal
steps
lieth
before
him
again
with
nought
to
guide
him
but
the
light
of
omrazu
on
the
edge
of
omrazu
shall
yeb
tarry
long
for
the
most
dreadful
part
of
his
journey
lieth
before
him
up
the
crystal
steps
that
lie
beyond
omrazu
he
must
go
and
any
that
follow
though
the
howling
of
all
the
meteors
that
ride
the
sky
for
in
that
part
of
the
crystal
space
go
many
meteors
up
and
down
all
squealing
in
the
dark
which
greatly
perplex
all
travellers
and
if
he
may
see
though
the
gleaming
of
the
meteors
and
in
spite
of
their
uproar
come
safely
through
he
shall
come
to
the
star
omrund
at
the
edge
of
the
track
of
stars
and
from
star
to
star
along
the
track
of
stars
the
soul
of
a
man
may
travel
with
more
ease
and
there
the
journey
lies
no
more
straight
forward
but
curves
to
the
right
then
said
king
ebalon
of
this
beggar
whom
my
horse
smote
down
thou
hast
spoken
much
but
i
sought
to
know
by
what
road
a
king
should
go
when
he
taketh
his
last
royal
journey
and
what
princes
and
what
people
should
meet
him
upon
another
shore
then
answered
monith
all
knowledge
is
with
the
king
it
hath
been
doomed
by
the
gods
who
speak
not
in
jest
that
thou
shalt
follow
the
soul
that
thou
didst
send
alone
upon
its
journey
that
that
soul
go
not
unattended
up
the
crystal
steps
moreover
as
this
beggar
went
upon
his
lonely
journey
he
dared
to
curse
the
king
and
his
curses
lie
like
a
red
mist
along
the
valleys
and
hollows
wherever
he
uttered
them
by
these
red
mists
o
king
thou
shalt
track
him
as
a
man
follows
a
river
by
night
until
thou
shalt
fare
at
last
to
the
land
wherein
he
hath
blessed
thee
repenting
of
anger
at
last
and
thou
shalt
see
his
blessing
lie
over
the
land
like
a
blaze
of
golden
sunshine
illumining
fields
and
gardens
then
said
the
king
the
gods
have
spoken
hard
above
the
snowy
peak
of
this
mountain
ahmoon
and
monith
said
how
a
man
may
come
to
the
shore
of
space
beyond
the
tides
of
time
i
know
not
but
it
is
doomed
that
thou
shalt
certainly
first
follow
the
beggar
past
the
moon
omrund
and
omrazu
till
thou
comest
to
the
track
of
stars
and
up
the
track
of
stars
coming
towards
the
right
along
the
edge
of
it
till
thou
comest
to
ingazi
there
the
soul
of
the
beggar
yeb
sat
long
then
breathing
deep
set
off
on
his
great
journey
earthward
adown
the
crystal
steps
straight
through
the
spaces
where
no
stars
are
found
to
rest
at
following
the
dull
gleam
of
earth
and
her
fields
till
he
come
at
last
where
journeys
end
and
start
then
said
king
ebalon
if
this
hard
tale
be
true
how
shall
i
find
the
beggar
that
i
must
follow
when
i
come
again
to
the
earth
and
the
prophet
answered
thou
shalt
know
him
by
his
name
and
find
him
in
this
place
for
that
beggar
shall
be
called
king
ebalon
and
he
shall
be
sitting
upon
the
throne
of
the
kings
of
zarkandhu
and
the
king
answered
if
one
sit
upon
this
throne
whom
men
call
king
ebalon
who
then
shall
i
be
and
the
prophet
answered
thou
shalt
be
a
beggar
and
thy
name
shall
be
yeb
and
thou
shalt
ever
tread
the
road
before
the
palace
waiting
for
alms
from
the
king
whom
men
shall
call
ebalon
then
said
the
king
hard
gods
indeed
are
those
that
tramp
the
snows
of
ahmoon
about
the
temple
of
azure
for
if
i
sinned
against
this
beggar
called
yeb
they
too
have
sinned
against
him
when
they
doomed
him
to
travel
on
this
weary
journey
though
he
hath
not
offended
and
monith
said
he
too
hath
offended
for
he
was
angry
as
thy
horse
struck
him
and
the
gods
smite
anger
and
his
anger
and
his
curses
doom
him
to
journey
without
rest
as
also
they
doom
thee
then
said
the
king
thou
that
sittest
upon
ahmoon
in
the
temple
of
azure
dreaming
thy
dreams
and
making
prophecies
foresee
the
ending
of
this
weary
quest
and
tell
me
where
it
shall
be
and
monith
answered
as
a
man
looks
across
great
lakes
i
have
gazed
into
the
days
to
be
and
as
the
great
flies
come
upon
four
wings
of
gauze
to
skim
over
blue
waters
so
have
my
dreams
come
sailing
two
by
two
out
of
the
days
to
be
and
i
dreamed
that
king
ebalon
whose
soul
was
not
thy
soul
stood
in
his
palace
in
a
time
far
hence
and
beggars
thronged
the
street
outside
and
among
them
was
yeb
a
beggar
having
thy
soul
and
it
was
on
the
morning
of
a
festival
and
the
king
came
robed
in
white
with
all
his
prophets
and
his
seers
and
magicians
all
down
the
marble
steps
to
bless
the
land
and
all
that
stood
therein
as
far
as
the
purple
hills
because
it
was
the
morning
of
festival
and
as
the
king
raised
up
his
hand
over
the
beggars
heads
to
bless
the
fields
and
rivers
and
all
that
stood
therein
i
dreamed
that
the
quest
was
ended
all
knowledge
is
with
the
king
evening
darkened
and
above
the
palace
domes
gleamed
out
the
stars
whereon
haply
others
missed
the
secret
too
and
outside
the
palace
in
the
dark
they
that
had
borne
the
wine
in
jewelled
cups
mocked
in
low
voices
at
the
king
and
at
the
wisdom
of
his
prophets
then
spake
ynar
called
the
prophet
of
the
crystal
peak
for
there
rises
amanath
above
all
that
land
a
mountain
whose
peak
is
crystal
and
ynar
beneath
its
summit
hath
his
temple
and
when
day
shines
no
longer
on
the
world
amanath
takes
the
sunlight
and
gleams
afar
as
a
beacon
in
a
bleak
land
lit
at
night
and
at
the
hour
when
all
faces
are
turned
on
amanath
ynar
comes
forth
beneath
the
crystal
peak
to
weave
strange
spells
and
to
make
signs
that
people
say
are
surely
for
the
gods
therefore
it
is
said
in
all
those
lands
that
ynar
speaks
at
evening
to
the
gods
when
all
the
world
is
still
and
ynar
said
all
knowledge
is
with
the
king
and
without
doubt
it
hath
come
to
the
king
ears
how
certain
speech
is
held
at
evening
on
the
peak
of
amanath
they
that
speak
to
me
at
evening
on
the
peak
are
they
that
live
in
a
city
through
whose
streets
death
walketh
not
and
i
have
heard
it
from
their
elders
that
the
king
shall
take
no
journey
only
from
thee
the
hills
shall
slip
away
the
dark
woods
the
sky
and
all
the
gleaming
worlds
that
fill
the
night
and
the
green
fields
shall
go
on
untrodden
by
thy
feet
and
the
blue
sky
ungazed
at
by
thine
eyes
and
still
the
rivers
shall
all
run
seaward
but
making
no
music
in
thine
ears
and
all
the
old
laments
shall
still
be
spoken
troubling
thee
not
and
to
the
earth
shall
fall
the
tears
of
the
children
of
earth
and
never
grieving
thee
pestilence
heat
and
cold
ignorance
famine
and
anger
these
things
shall
grip
their
claws
upon
all
men
as
heretofore
in
fields
and
roads
and
cities
but
shall
not
hold
thee
but
from
thy
soul
sitting
in
the
old
worn
track
of
the
worlds
when
all
is
gone
away
shall
fall
off
the
shackles
of
circumstance
and
thou
shalt
dream
thy
dreams
alone
and
thou
shalt
find
that
dreams
are
real
where
there
is
nought
as
far
as
the
rim
but
only
thy
dreams
and
thee
with
them
thou
shalt
build
palaces
and
cities
resting
upon
nothing
and
having
no
place
in
time
not
to
be
assailed
by
the
hours
or
harmed
by
ivy
or
rust
not
to
be
taken
by
conquerors
but
destroyed
by
thy
fancy
if
thou
dost
wish
it
so
or
by
thy
fancy
rebuilded
and
nought
shall
ever
disturb
these
dreams
of
thine
which
here
are
troubled
and
lost
by
all
the
happenings
of
earth
as
the
dreams
of
one
who
sleeps
in
a
tumultuous
city
for
these
thy
dreams
shall
sweep
outward
like
a
strong
river
over
a
great
waste
plain
wherein
are
neither
rocks
nor
hills
to
turn
it
only
in
that
place
there
shall
be
no
boundaries
nor
sea
neither
hindrance
nor
end
and
it
were
well
for
thee
that
thou
shouldst
take
few
regrets
into
thy
waste
dominions
from
the
world
wherein
thou
livest
for
such
regrets
or
any
memory
of
deeds
ill
done
must
sit
beside
thy
soul
forever
in
that
waste
singing
one
song
always
of
forlorn
remorse
and
they
too
shall
be
only
dreams
but
very
real
there
nought
shall
hinder
thee
among
thy
dreams
for
even
the
gods
may
harass
thee
no
more
when
flesh
and
earth
and
events
with
which
they
bound
thee
shall
have
slipped
away
then
said
the
king
i
like
not
this
grey
doom
for
dreams
are
empty
i
would
see
action
roaring
through
the
world
and
men
and
deeds
then
answered
the
prophet
victory
jewels
and
dancing
but
please
thy
fancy
what
is
the
sparkle
of
the
gem
to
thee
without
thy
fancy
which
it
allures
and
thy
fancy
is
all
a
dream
action
and
deeds
and
men
are
nought
without
dreams
and
do
but
fetter
them
and
only
dreams
are
real
and
where
thou
stayest
when
the
worlds
shall
drift
away
there
shall
be
only
dreams
and
the
king
answered
a
mad
prophet
and
ynar
said
a
mad
prophet
but
believing
that
his
soul
possesseth
all
things
of
which
his
soul
may
become
aware
and
that
he
is
master
of
that
soul
and
thou
a
king
believing
only
that
thy
soul
possesseth
such
few
countries
as
are
leaguered
by
thine
armies
and
the
sea
and
that
thy
soul
is
possessed
by
certain
strange
gods
of
whom
thou
knowest
not
who
shall
deal
with
it
in
a
way
whereof
thou
knowest
not
until
a
knowledge
come
to
us
that
either
is
wrong
i
have
wider
realms
i
king
than
thee
and
hold
them
beneath
no
overlords
then
said
the
king
thou
hast
said
no
overlords
to
whom
then
dost
thou
speak
by
strange
signs
at
evening
above
the
world
and
ynar
went
forward
and
whispered
to
the
king
and
the
king
shouted
seize
ye
this
prophet
for
he
is
a
hypocrite
and
speaks
to
no
gods
at
evening
above
the
world
but
has
deceived
us
with
his
signs
and
ynar
said
come
not
near
me
or
i
shall
point
towards
you
when
i
speak
at
evening
upon
the
mountain
with
those
that
ye
know
of
then
ynar
went
away
and
the
guards
touched
him
not
then
spake
the
prophet
thun
who
was
clad
in
seaweed
and
had
no
temple
but
lived
apart
from
men
all
his
life
he
had
lived
on
a
lonely
beach
and
had
heard
for
ever
the
wailing
of
the
sea
and
the
crying
of
the
wind
in
hollows
among
the
cliffs
some
said
that
having
lived
so
long
by
the
full
beating
of
the
sea
and
where
always
the
wind
cries
loudest
he
could
not
feel
the
joys
of
other
men
but
only
felt
the
sorrow
of
the
sea
crying
in
his
soul
for
ever
long
ago
on
the
path
of
stars
midmost
between
the
worlds
there
strode
the
gods
of
old
in
the
bleak
middle
of
the
worlds
they
sat
and
the
worlds
went
round
and
round
like
dead
leaves
in
the
wind
at
autumn
end
with
never
a
life
on
one
while
the
gods
went
sighing
for
the
things
that
might
not
be
and
the
centuries
went
over
the
gods
to
go
where
the
centuries
go
toward
the
end
of
things
and
with
them
went
the
sighs
of
all
the
gods
as
they
longed
for
what
might
not
be
one
by
one
in
the
midst
of
the
worlds
fell
dead
the
gods
of
old
still
sighing
for
the
things
that
might
not
be
all
slain
by
their
own
regrets
only
shimono
kani
the
youngest
of
the
gods
made
him
a
harp
out
of
the
heart
strings
of
all
the
elder
gods
and
sitting
upon
the
path
of
stars
in
the
middle
of
things
played
upon
the
harp
a
dirge
for
the
gods
of
old
and
the
song
told
of
all
vain
regrets
and
of
unhappy
loves
of
the
gods
in
the
olden
time
and
of
their
great
deeds
that
were
to
adorn
the
future
years
but
into
the
dirge
of
shimono
kani
came
voices
crying
out
of
the
heart
strings
of
the
gods
all
sighing
still
for
the
things
that
might
not
be
and
the
dirge
and
the
voices
crying
go
drifting
away
from
the
path
of
stars
away
from
the
midst
of
things
till
they
come
twittering
among
the
worlds
like
a
great
host
of
birds
that
are
lost
by
night
and
every
note
is
a
life
and
many
notes
become
caught
up
among
the
worlds
to
be
entangled
with
flesh
for
a
little
while
before
they
pass
again
on
their
journey
to
the
great
anthem
that
roars
at
the
end
of
time
shimono
kani
hath
given
a
voice
to
the
wind
and
added
a
sorrow
to
the
sea
but
when
in
lighted
chambers
after
feasting
there
arises
the
voice
of
the
singer
to
please
the
king
then
is
the
soul
of
that
singer
crying
aloud
to
his
fellows
from
where
he
stands
chained
to
earth
and
when
at
the
sound
of
the
singing
the
heart
of
the
king
grows
sad
and
his
princes
lament
then
they
remember
though
knowing
not
that
they
remember
it
the
sad
face
of
shimono
kani
sitting
by
his
dead
brethren
the
elder
gods
playing
on
the
harp
of
crying
heart
strings
whereby
he
sent
their
souls
among
the
worlds
and
when
the
music
of
one
lute
is
lonely
on
the
hills
at
night
then
one
soul
calleth
to
his
brother
souls
the
notes
of
shimono
dirge
which
have
not
been
caught
among
the
worlds
and
he
knoweth
not
to
whom
he
calls
or
why
but
knoweth
only
that
minstrelsy
is
his
only
cry
and
sendeth
it
out
into
the
dark
but
although
in
the
prison
houses
of
earth
all
memories
must
die
yet
as
there
sometimes
clings
to
a
prisoner
feet
some
dust
of
the
fields
wherein
he
was
captured
so
sometimes
fragments
of
remembrance
cling
to
a
man
soul
after
it
hath
been
taken
to
earth
then
a
great
minstrel
arises
and
weaving
together
the
shreds
of
his
memories
maketh
some
melody
such
as
the
hand
of
shimono
kani
smites
out
of
his
harp
and
they
that
pass
by
say
there
not
been
some
such
melody
before
and
pass
on
sad
at
heart
for
memories
which
are
not
therefore
o
king
one
day
the
great
gates
of
thy
palace
shall
lie
open
for
a
procession
wherein
the
king
comes
down
to
pass
through
a
people
lamenting
with
lute
and
drum
and
on
the
same
day
a
prison
door
shall
be
opened
by
relenting
hands
and
one
more
lost
note
of
shimono
kani
dirge
shall
go
back
to
swell
his
melody
again
the
dirge
of
shimono
kani
shall
roll
on
till
one
day
it
shall
come
with
all
its
notes
complete
to
overwhelm
the
silence
that
sits
at
the
end
of
things
then
shall
shimono
kani
say
to
his
brethren
bones
the
things
that
might
not
be
have
at
last
become
but
very
quiet
shall
be
the
bones
of
the
gods
of
old
and
only
their
voices
shall
live
which
cried
from
the
harp
of
heart
strings
for
the
things
which
might
not
be
when
the
caravans
saying
farewell
to
zandara
set
out
across
the
waste
northwards
towards
einandhu
they
follow
the
desert
track
for
seven
days
before
they
come
to
water
where
shubah
onath
rises
black
out
of
the
waste
with
a
well
at
its
foot
and
herbage
on
its
summit
on
this
rock
a
prophet
hath
his
temple
and
is
called
the
prophet
of
journeys
and
hath
carven
in
a
southern
window
smiling
along
the
camel
track
all
gods
that
are
benignant
to
caravans
there
a
traveller
may
learn
by
prophecy
whether
he
shall
accomplish
the
ten
days
journey
thence
across
the
desert
and
so
come
to
the
white
city
of
einandhu
or
whether
his
bones
shall
lie
with
the
bones
of
old
along
the
desert
track
no
name
hath
the
prophet
of
journeys
for
none
is
needed
in
that
desert
where
no
man
calls
nor
ever
a
man
answers
thus
spake
the
prophet
of
journeys
standing
before
the
king
the
journey
of
the
king
shall
be
an
old
journey
pushed
on
apace
many
a
year
before
the
making
of
the
moon
thou
camest
down
with
dream
camels
from
the
city
without
a
name
that
stands
beyond
all
the
stars
and
then
began
thy
journey
over
the
waste
of
nought
and
thy
dream
camel
bore
thee
well
when
those
of
certain
of
thy
fellow
travellers
fell
down
in
the
waste
and
were
covered
over
by
the
silence
and
were
turned
again
to
nought
and
those
travellers
when
their
dream
camels
fell
having
nothing
to
carry
them
further
over
the
waste
were
lost
beyond
and
never
found
the
earth
these
are
those
men
that
might
have
been
but
were
not
and
all
about
thee
fluttered
the
myriad
hours
travelling
in
great
swarms
across
the
waste
of
nought
how
many
centuries
passed
across
the
cities
while
thou
wast
making
thy
journey
none
may
reckon
for
there
is
no
time
in
the
waste
of
nought
but
only
the
hours
fluttering
earthwards
from
beyond
to
do
the
work
of
time
at
last
the
travellers
saw
far
off
a
green
place
gleaming
and
made
haste
towards
it
and
so
came
to
earth
and
there
o
king
ye
rest
for
a
little
while
thou
and
those
that
came
with
thee
making
an
encampment
upon
earth
before
journeying
on
there
the
swarming
hours
alight
settling
on
every
blade
of
grass
and
tree
and
spreading
over
your
tents
and
devouring
all
things
and
at
last
bending
your
very
tent
poles
with
their
weight
and
wearying
you
behind
the
encampment
in
the
shadow
of
the
tents
lurks
a
dark
figure
with
a
nimble
sword
having
the
name
of
time
this
is
he
that
hath
called
the
hours
from
beyond
and
he
it
is
that
is
their
master
and
it
is
his
work
that
the
hours
do
as
they
devour
all
green
things
upon
the
earth
and
tatter
the
tents
and
weary
all
the
travellers
as
each
of
the
hours
does
the
work
of
time
time
smites
him
with
his
nimble
sword
as
soon
as
his
work
is
done
and
the
hour
falls
severed
to
the
dust
with
his
bright
wings
scattered
as
a
locust
cut
asunder
by
the
scimitar
of
a
skillful
swordsman
one
by
one
o
king
with
a
stir
in
the
camp
and
the
folding
up
of
the
tents
one
by
one
the
travellers
shall
push
on
again
on
the
journey
begun
so
long
before
out
of
the
city
without
a
name
to
the
place
where
dream
camels
go
striding
free
through
the
waste
so
into
the
waste
o
king
thou
shalt
set
forth
ere
long
perhaps
to
renew
friendships
begun
during
thy
short
encampment
upon
earth
other
green
places
thou
shalt
meet
in
the
waste
and
thereon
shalt
encamp
again
until
driven
thence
by
the
hours
what
prophet
shall
relate
how
many
journeys
thou
shalt
make
or
how
many
encampments
but
at
last
thou
shalt
come
to
the
place
of
the
resting
of
camels
and
there
shall
gleaming
cliffs
that
are
named
the
ending
of
journeys
lift
up
out
of
the
waste
of
nought
nought
at
their
feet
nought
laying
wide
before
them
with
only
the
glint
of
worlds
far
off
to
illumine
the
waste
one
by
one
on
tired
dream
camels
the
travellers
shall
come
in
and
going
up
the
pathway
through
the
cliff
in
that
land
of
the
resting
of
camels
shall
come
on
the
city
of
ceasing
there
the
pinnacles
and
the
spires
that
are
builded
of
men
hopes
shall
rise
up
real
before
thee
seen
only
hitherto
as
a
mirage
in
the
waste
so
far
the
swarming
hours
may
not
come
and
far
away
among
the
tents
shall
stand
the
dark
figure
with
the
nimble
sword
but
in
the
scintillant
streets
under
the
abodes
of
the
last
of
cities
thy
journey
o
king
shall
end
in
the
valley
beyond
sidono
there
lies
a
garden
of
poppies
and
where
the
poppies
heads
are
all
with
summer
breezes
that
go
up
the
valley
there
lies
a
path
well
strewn
with
ocean
shells
over
summit
the
birds
come
streaming
to
the
lake
that
lies
in
the
valley
of
the
garden
and
behind
them
rises
the
sun
sending
sidono
shadow
as
far
as
the
edge
of
the
lake
and
down
the
path
of
many
ocean
shells
when
they
begin
to
gleam
in
the
sun
every
morning
walks
an
aged
man
clad
in
a
silken
robe
with
strange
devices
woven
a
little
temple
where
the
old
man
lives
stands
at
the
edge
of
the
path
none
worship
there
for
zornadhu
the
old
prophet
hath
forsaken
men
to
walk
among
his
poppies
for
zornadhu
hath
failed
to
understand
the
purport
of
kings
and
cities
and
the
moving
up
and
down
of
many
people
to
the
tune
of
the
clinking
of
gold
therefore
hath
zornadhu
gone
far
away
from
the
sound
of
cities
and
from
those
that
are
ensnared
thereby
and
beyond
sidono
mountain
hath
come
to
rest
where
there
are
neither
kings
nor
armies
nor
bartering
for
gold
but
only
the
heads
of
the
poppies
that
sway
in
the
wind
together
and
the
birds
that
fly
from
sidono
to
the
lake
and
then
the
sunrise
over
sidono
summit
and
afterwards
the
flight
of
birds
out
of
the
lake
and
over
sidono
again
and
sunset
behind
the
valley
and
high
over
lake
and
garden
the
stars
that
know
not
cities
there
zornadhu
lives
in
his
garden
of
poppies
with
sidono
standing
between
him
and
the
whole
world
of
men
and
when
the
wind
blowing
athwart
the
valley
sways
the
heads
of
the
tall
poppies
against
the
temple
wall
the
old
prophet
says
the
flowers
are
all
praying
and
lo
they
be
nearer
to
the
gods
than
men
but
the
heralds
of
the
king
coming
after
many
days
of
travel
to
sidono
perceived
the
garden
valley
by
the
lake
they
saw
the
poppy
garden
gleaming
round
and
small
like
a
sunrise
over
water
on
a
misty
morning
seen
by
some
shepherd
from
the
hills
and
descending
the
bare
mountain
for
three
days
they
came
to
the
gaunt
pines
and
ever
between
the
tall
trunks
came
the
glare
of
the
poppies
that
shone
from
the
garden
valley
for
a
whole
day
they
travelled
through
the
pines
that
night
a
cold
wind
came
up
the
garden
valley
crying
against
the
poppies
low
in
his
temple
with
a
song
of
exceeding
grief
zornadhu
in
the
morning
made
a
dirge
for
the
passing
of
poppies
because
in
the
night
time
there
had
fallen
petals
that
might
not
return
or
ever
come
again
into
the
garden
valley
outside
the
temple
on
the
path
of
ocean
shells
the
heralds
halted
and
read
the
names
and
honours
of
the
king
and
from
the
temple
came
the
voice
of
zornadhu
still
singing
his
lament
but
they
took
him
from
his
garden
because
of
the
king
command
and
down
his
gleaming
path
of
ocean
shells
and
away
up
sidono
and
left
the
temple
empty
with
none
to
lament
when
silken
poppies
died
and
the
will
of
the
wind
of
the
autumn
was
wrought
upon
the
poppies
and
the
heads
of
the
poppies
that
rose
from
the
earth
went
down
to
the
earth
again
as
the
plume
of
a
warrior
smitten
in
a
heathen
fight
far
away
where
there
are
none
to
lament
him
thus
out
of
his
land
of
flowers
went
zornadhu
and
came
perforce
into
the
lands
of
men
and
saw
cities
and
in
the
city
midst
stood
up
before
the
king
and
the
king
said
zornadhu
what
of
the
journey
of
the
king
and
of
the
princes
and
the
people
that
shall
meet
me
zornadhu
answered
i
know
nought
of
kings
but
in
the
night
time
the
poppy
made
his
journey
a
little
before
dawn
thereafter
the
wildfowl
came
as
is
their
wont
over
sidono
summit
and
the
sun
rising
behind
them
gleamed
upon
sidono
and
all
the
flowers
of
the
lake
awoke
and
the
bee
passing
up
and
down
the
garden
went
droning
to
other
poppies
and
the
flowers
of
the
lake
they
that
had
known
the
poppy
knew
him
no
more
and
the
sun
rays
slanting
from
sidono
crest
lit
still
a
garden
valley
where
one
poppy
waved
his
petals
to
the
dawn
no
more
and
i
o
king
that
down
a
path
of
gleaming
ocean
shells
walk
in
the
morning
found
not
nor
have
since
found
that
poppy
again
that
hath
gone
on
the
journey
whence
there
is
not
returning
out
of
my
garden
valley
and
i
o
king
made
a
dirge
to
cry
beyond
that
valley
and
the
poppies
bowed
their
heads
but
there
is
no
cry
nor
no
lament
that
may
adjure
the
life
to
return
again
to
a
flower
that
grew
in
a
garden
once
and
hereafter
is
not
unto
what
place
the
lives
of
poppies
have
gone
no
man
shall
truly
say
sure
it
is
that
to
that
place
are
only
outward
tracks
only
it
may
be
that
when
a
man
dreams
at
evening
in
a
garden
where
heavily
the
scent
of
poppies
hangs
in
the
air
when
the
winds
have
sunk
and
far
away
the
sound
of
a
lute
is
heard
on
lonely
hills
as
he
dreams
of
poppies
that
once
were
together
in
the
gardens
of
his
youth
the
lives
of
those
old
lost
poppies
shall
return
living
again
in
his
dream
there
may
dream
the
gods
and
through
the
dreams
of
some
divinity
reclining
in
tinted
fields
above
the
morning
we
may
haply
pass
again
although
our
bodies
have
long
swirled
up
and
down
the
world
with
other
dust
in
these
strange
dreams
our
lives
may
be
again
all
in
the
centre
of
our
hopes
rejoicings
and
laments
until
above
the
morning
the
gods
wake
to
go
about
their
work
haply
to
remember
still
their
idle
dreams
haply
to
dream
them
all
again
in
the
stillness
when
shines
the
starlight
of
the
gods
then
said
the
king
i
like
not
these
strange
journeys
nor
this
faint
wandering
through
the
dreams
of
gods
like
the
shadow
of
a
weary
camel
that
may
not
rest
when
the
sun
is
low
the
gods
that
have
made
me
to
love
the
earth
cool
woods
and
dancing
streams
do
ill
to
send
me
into
the
starry
spaces
that
i
love
not
with
my
soul
still
peering
earthward
through
the
eternal
years
as
a
beggar
who
once
was
noble
staring
from
the
street
at
lighted
halls
for
wherever
the
gods
may
send
me
i
shall
be
as
the
gods
have
made
me
a
creature
loving
the
green
fields
of
earth
now
if
there
stand
one
prophet
here
that
hath
the
ear
of
those
too
splendid
gods
that
stride
above
the
glories
of
the
orient
sky
tell
them
that
there
is
on
earth
one
king
in
the
land
called
zarkandhu
to
the
south
of
the
opal
mountains
who
would
fain
tarry
among
the
many
gardens
of
earth
and
would
leave
to
other
men
the
splendours
that
the
gods
shall
give
the
dead
above
the
twilight
that
surrounds
the
stars
then
spake
yamen
prophet
of
the
temple
of
obin
that
stands
on
the
shores
of
a
great
lake
facing
east
yamen
said
i
pray
oft
to
the
gods
who
sit
above
the
twilight
behind
the
east
when
the
clouds
are
heavy
and
red
at
sunset
or
when
there
is
boding
of
thunder
or
eclipse
then
i
pray
not
lest
my
prayers
be
scattered
and
beaten
earthward
but
when
the
sun
sets
in
a
tranquil
sky
pale
green
or
azure
and
the
light
of
his
farewells
stays
long
upon
lonely
hills
then
i
send
forth
my
prayers
to
flutter
upward
to
gods
that
are
surely
smiling
and
the
gods
hear
my
prayers
but
o
king
boons
sought
out
of
due
time
from
the
gods
are
never
wholly
to
be
desired
and
if
they
should
grant
to
thee
to
tarry
on
the
earth
old
age
would
trouble
thee
with
burdens
more
and
more
till
thou
wouldst
become
the
driven
slave
of
the
hours
in
fetters
that
none
may
break
the
king
said
they
that
have
devised
this
burden
of
age
may
surely
stay
it
pray
therefore
on
the
calmest
evening
of
the
year
to
the
gods
above
the
twilight
that
i
may
tarry
always
on
the
earth
and
always
young
while
over
my
head
the
scourges
of
the
gods
pass
and
alight
not
then
answered
yamen
the
king
hath
commanded
yet
among
the
blessings
of
the
gods
there
always
cries
a
curse
the
great
princes
that
make
merry
with
the
king
who
tell
of
the
great
deeds
that
the
king
wrought
in
the
former
time
shall
one
by
one
grow
old
and
thou
o
king
seated
at
the
feast
crying
merry
and
extolling
the
former
time
shall
find
about
thee
white
heads
nodding
in
sleep
and
men
that
are
forgetting
the
former
time
then
one
by
one
the
names
of
those
that
sported
with
thee
once
called
by
the
gods
one
by
one
the
names
of
the
singers
that
sing
the
songs
thou
lovest
called
by
the
gods
lastly
of
those
that
chased
the
grey
boar
by
night
and
took
him
in
orghoom
river
only
the
king
then
a
new
people
that
have
not
known
the
old
deeds
of
the
king
nor
fought
and
chased
with
him
who
dare
not
make
merry
with
the
king
as
did
his
long
dead
princes
and
all
the
while
those
princes
that
are
dead
growing
dearer
and
greater
in
thy
memory
and
all
the
while
the
men
that
served
thee
then
growing
more
small
to
thee
and
all
the
old
things
fading
and
new
things
arising
which
are
not
as
the
old
things
were
the
world
changing
yearly
before
thine
eyes
and
the
gardens
of
thy
childhood
overgrown
because
thy
childhood
was
in
the
olden
years
thou
shalt
love
the
olden
years
but
ever
the
new
years
shall
overthrow
them
and
their
customs
and
not
the
will
of
a
king
may
stay
the
changes
that
the
gods
have
planned
for
all
the
customs
of
old
ever
thou
shalt
say
was
not
so
and
ever
the
new
custom
shall
prevail
even
against
a
king
when
thou
hast
made
merry
a
thousand
times
thou
shalt
grow
tired
of
making
merry
at
last
thou
shalt
become
weary
of
the
chase
and
still
old
age
shall
not
come
near
to
thee
to
stifle
desires
that
have
been
too
oft
fulfilled
then
o
king
thou
shalt
be
a
hunter
yearning
for
the
chase
but
with
nought
to
pursue
that
hath
not
been
oft
overcome
old
age
shall
come
not
to
bury
thine
ambitions
in
a
time
when
there
is
nought
for
thee
to
aspire
to
any
more
experience
of
many
centuries
shall
make
thee
wise
but
hard
and
very
sad
and
thou
shalt
be
a
mind
apart
from
thy
fellows
and
curse
them
all
for
fools
and
they
shall
not
perceive
thy
wisdom
because
thy
thoughts
are
not
their
thoughts
and
the
gods
that
they
have
made
are
not
the
gods
of
the
olden
time
no
solace
shall
thy
wisdom
bring
thee
but
only
an
increasing
knowledge
that
thou
knowest
nought
and
thou
shalt
feel
as
a
wise
man
in
a
world
of
fools
or
else
as
a
fool
in
a
world
of
wise
men
when
all
men
feel
so
sure
and
ever
thy
doubts
increase
when
all
that
spake
with
thee
of
thine
old
deeds
are
dead
those
that
saw
them
not
shall
speak
of
them
again
to
thee
till
one
speaking
to
thee
of
thy
deeds
of
valour
add
more
than
even
a
man
should
when
speaking
to
a
king
and
thou
shalt
suddenly
doubt
whether
these
great
deeds
were
and
there
shall
be
none
to
tell
thee
only
the
echoes
of
the
voices
of
the
gods
still
singing
in
thine
ears
when
long
ago
they
called
the
princes
that
were
thy
friends
and
thou
shalt
hear
the
knowledge
of
the
olden
time
most
wrongly
told
and
afterwards
forgotten
then
many
prophets
shall
arise
claiming
discovery
of
that
old
knowledge
then
thou
shalt
find
that
seeking
knowledge
is
vain
as
the
chase
is
vain
as
making
merry
is
vain
as
all
things
are
vain
one
day
thou
shalt
find
that
it
is
vain
to
be
a
king
greatly
then
will
the
acclamations
of
the
people
weary
thee
till
the
time
when
people
grow
aweary
of
kings
then
thou
shalt
know
that
thou
hast
been
uprooted
from
thine
olden
time
and
set
to
live
in
uncongenial
years
and
jests
all
new
to
royal
ears
shall
smite
thee
on
the
head
like
hailstones
when
thou
hast
lost
thy
crown
when
those
to
whose
grandsires
thou
hadst
granted
to
bring
them
as
children
to
kiss
the
feet
of
the
king
shall
mock
at
thee
because
thou
hast
not
learnt
to
barter
with
gold
not
all
the
marvels
of
the
future
time
shall
atone
to
thee
for
those
old
memories
that
glow
warmer
and
brighter
every
year
as
they
recede
into
the
ages
that
the
gods
have
gathered
and
always
dreaming
of
thy
long
dead
princes
and
of
the
great
kings
of
other
kingdoms
in
the
olden
time
thou
shalt
fail
to
see
the
grandeur
to
which
a
hurrying
jesting
people
shall
attain
in
that
kingless
age
lastly
o
king
thou
shalt
perceive
men
changing
in
a
way
that
thou
shalt
not
comprehend
knowing
what
thou
canst
not
know
till
thou
shalt
discover
that
these
are
men
no
more
and
a
new
race
holds
dominion
over
the
earth
whose
forefathers
were
men
these
shall
speak
to
thee
no
more
as
they
hurry
upon
a
quest
that
thou
shalt
never
understand
and
thou
shalt
know
that
thou
canst
no
longer
take
thy
part
in
shaping
destinies
but
in
a
world
of
cities
only
pine
for
air
and
the
waving
grass
again
and
the
sound
of
a
wind
in
trees
then
even
this
shall
end
with
the
shapes
of
the
gods
in
the
darkness
gathering
all
lives
but
thine
when
the
hills
shall
fling
up
earth
long
stored
heat
back
to
the
heavens
again
when
earth
shall
be
old
and
cold
with
nothing
alive
upon
it
but
one
king
then
said
the
king
pray
to
those
hard
gods
still
for
those
that
have
loved
the
earth
with
all
its
gardens
and
woods
and
singing
streams
will
love
earth
still
when
it
is
old
and
cold
and
with
all
its
gardens
gone
and
all
the
purport
of
its
being
failed
and
nought
but
memories
then
spake
paharn
a
prophet
of
the
land
of
hurn
and
paharn
said
there
was
one
man
that
knew
but
he
stands
not
here
and
the
king
said
is
he
further
than
my
heralds
might
travel
in
the
night
if
they
went
upon
fleet
horses
and
the
prophet
answered
he
is
no
further
than
thy
heralds
may
well
travel
in
the
night
but
further
than
they
may
return
from
in
all
the
years
out
of
this
city
there
goes
a
valley
wandering
through
all
the
world
and
opens
out
at
last
on
the
green
land
of
hurn
on
the
one
side
in
the
distance
gleams
the
sea
and
on
the
other
side
a
forest
black
and
ancient
darkens
the
fields
of
hurn
beyond
the
forest
and
the
sea
there
is
no
more
saving
the
twilight
and
beyond
that
the
gods
in
the
mouth
of
the
valley
sleeps
the
village
of
rhistaun
here
i
was
born
and
heard
the
murmur
of
the
flocks
and
herds
and
saw
the
tall
smoke
standing
between
the
sky
and
the
still
roofs
of
rhistaun
and
learned
that
men
might
not
go
into
the
dark
forest
and
that
beyond
the
forest
and
the
sea
was
nought
saving
the
twilight
and
beyond
that
the
gods
often
there
came
travellers
from
the
world
all
down
the
winding
valley
and
spake
with
strange
speech
in
rhistaun
and
returned
again
up
the
valley
going
back
to
the
world
sometimes
with
bells
and
camels
and
men
running
on
foot
kings
came
down
the
valley
from
the
world
but
always
the
travellers
returned
by
the
valley
again
and
none
went
further
than
the
land
of
hurn
and
kithneb
also
was
born
in
the
land
of
hurn
and
tended
the
flocks
with
me
but
kithneb
would
not
care
to
listen
to
the
murmur
of
the
flocks
and
herds
and
see
the
tall
smoke
standing
between
the
roofs
and
the
sky
but
needed
to
know
how
far
from
hurn
it
was
that
the
world
met
the
twilight
and
how
far
across
the
twilight
sat
the
gods
and
often
kithneb
dreamed
as
he
tended
the
flocks
and
herds
and
when
others
slept
he
would
wander
near
to
the
edge
of
the
forest
wherein
men
might
not
go
and
the
elders
of
the
land
of
hurn
reproved
kithneb
when
he
dreamed
yet
kithneb
was
still
as
other
men
and
mingled
with
his
fellows
until
the
day
of
which
i
will
tell
thee
o
king
for
kithneb
was
aged
about
a
score
of
years
and
he
and
i
were
sitting
near
the
flocks
and
he
gazed
long
at
the
point
where
the
dark
forest
met
the
sea
at
the
end
of
the
land
of
hurn
but
when
night
drove
the
twilight
down
under
the
forest
we
brought
the
flocks
together
to
rhistaun
and
i
went
up
the
street
between
the
houses
to
see
four
princes
that
had
come
down
the
valley
from
the
world
and
they
were
clad
in
blue
and
scarlet
and
wore
plumes
upon
their
heads
and
they
gave
us
in
exchange
for
our
sheep
some
gleaming
stones
which
they
told
us
were
of
great
value
on
the
word
of
princes
and
i
sold
them
three
sheep
and
darniag
sold
them
eight
but
kithneb
came
not
with
the
others
to
the
market
place
where
the
four
princes
stood
but
went
alone
across
the
fields
to
the
edge
of
the
forest
and
it
was
upon
the
next
morning
that
the
strange
thing
befell
kithneb
for
i
saw
him
in
the
morning
coming
from
the
fields
and
i
hailed
him
with
the
shepherd
cry
wherewith
we
shepherds
call
to
one
another
and
he
answered
not
then
i
stopped
and
spake
to
him
and
kithneb
said
not
a
word
till
i
became
angry
and
left
him
then
we
spake
together
concerning
kithneb
and
others
had
hailed
him
and
he
had
not
answered
them
but
to
one
he
had
said
that
he
had
heard
the
voices
of
the
gods
speaking
beyond
the
forest
and
so
would
never
listen
more
to
the
voices
of
men
then
we
said
is
mad
and
none
hindered
him
another
took
his
place
among
the
flocks
and
kithneb
sat
in
the
evenings
by
the
edge
of
the
forest
on
the
plain
alone
so
kithneb
spake
to
none
for
many
days
but
when
any
forced
him
to
speak
he
said
that
every
evening
he
heard
the
gods
when
they
came
to
sit
in
the
forest
from
over
the
twilight
and
sea
and
that
he
would
speak
no
more
with
men
but
as
the
months
went
by
men
in
rhistaun
came
to
look
on
kithneb
as
a
prophet
and
we
were
wont
to
point
to
him
when
strangers
came
down
the
valley
from
the
world
saying
in
the
land
of
hurn
we
have
a
prophet
such
as
you
have
not
among
your
cities
for
he
speaks
at
evening
with
the
gods
a
year
had
passed
over
the
silence
of
kithneb
when
he
came
to
me
and
spake
and
i
bowed
before
him
because
we
believed
that
he
spake
among
the
gods
and
kithneb
said
will
speak
to
thee
before
the
end
because
i
am
most
lonely
for
how
may
i
speak
again
with
men
and
women
in
the
little
streets
of
rhistaun
among
the
houses
when
i
have
heard
the
voices
of
the
gods
singing
above
the
twilight
but
i
am
more
lonely
than
ever
rhistaun
wonts
of
for
this
i
tell
thee
i
hear
the
gods
i
know
not
what
they
well
indeed
i
know
the
voice
of
each
for
ever
calling
me
away
from
contentment
well
i
know
their
voices
as
they
call
to
my
soul
and
trouble
it
i
know
by
their
tone
when
they
rejoice
and
i
know
when
they
are
sad
for
even
the
gods
feel
sadness
i
know
when
over
fallen
cities
of
the
past
and
the
curved
white
bones
of
heroes
they
sing
the
dirges
of
the
gods
lament
but
alas
their
words
i
know
not
and
the
wonderful
strains
of
the
melody
of
their
speech
beat
on
my
soul
and
pass
away
unknown
i
travelled
from
the
land
of
hurn
till
i
came
to
the
house
of
the
prophet
and
told
him
that
i
sought
to
find
the
meaning
of
the
gods
and
told
me
to
ask
the
shepherds
concerning
all
the
gods
for
what
the
shepherds
knew
it
was
meet
for
a
man
to
know
and
beyond
that
knowledge
turned
into
trouble
i
told
that
i
had
heard
myself
the
voices
of
the
gods
and
knew
that
they
were
there
beyond
the
twilight
and
so
could
never
more
bow
down
to
the
gods
that
the
shepherds
made
from
the
red
clay
which
they
scooped
with
their
hands
out
of
the
hillside
said
to
me
natheless
forget
that
thou
hast
heard
the
gods
and
bow
down
again
to
the
gods
of
the
red
clay
that
the
shepherds
make
and
find
thereby
the
ease
that
the
shepherds
find
and
at
last
die
remembering
devoutly
the
gods
of
the
red
clay
that
the
shepherds
scooped
with
their
hands
out
of
the
hill
for
the
gifts
of
the
gods
that
sit
beyond
the
twilight
and
smile
at
the
gods
of
clay
are
neither
ease
nor
contentment
i
said
the
god
that
my
mother
made
out
of
the
red
clay
that
she
had
got
from
the
hill
fashioning
it
with
many
arms
and
eyes
as
she
sang
me
songs
of
its
power
and
told
me
stories
of
its
mystic
birth
this
god
is
lost
and
broken
and
ever
in
my
ears
is
ringing
the
melody
of
the
gods
said
if
thou
wouldst
still
seek
knowledge
know
that
only
those
that
come
behind
the
gods
may
clearly
know
their
meaning
and
this
thou
canst
only
do
by
taking
ship
and
putting
out
to
sea
from
the
land
of
hurn
and
sailing
up
the
coast
towards
the
forest
there
the
sea
cliffs
turn
to
the
left
or
southward
and
full
upon
them
beats
the
twilight
from
over
the
sea
and
there
thou
mayest
come
round
behind
the
forest
here
where
the
world
edge
mingles
with
the
twilight
the
gods
come
in
the
evening
and
if
thou
canst
come
behind
them
thou
shalt
hear
their
voices
clear
beating
full
seaward
and
filling
all
the
twilight
with
sound
of
song
and
thou
shalt
know
the
meaning
of
the
gods
but
where
the
cliffs
turn
southward
there
sits
behind
the
gods
brimdono
the
oldest
whirlpool
in
the
sea
roaring
to
guard
his
masters
him
the
gods
have
chained
for
ever
to
the
floor
of
the
twilit
sea
to
guard
the
door
of
the
forest
that
lieth
above
the
cliffs
here
then
if
thou
canst
hear
the
voices
of
the
gods
as
thou
hast
said
thou
wilt
know
their
meaning
clear
but
this
will
profit
thee
little
when
brimdono
drags
thee
down
and
all
thy
ship
thus
spake
kithneb
to
me
but
i
said
kithneb
forget
those
gods
beyond
the
forest
and
if
thy
small
god
be
lost
thou
shalt
worship
with
me
the
small
god
that
my
mother
made
thousands
of
years
ago
he
conquered
cities
but
is
not
any
longer
an
angry
god
pray
to
him
kithneb
and
he
shall
bring
thee
comfort
and
increase
to
thy
flocks
and
a
mild
spring
and
at
the
last
a
quiet
ending
for
thy
days
but
kithneb
heeded
not
and
only
bade
me
find
a
fisher
ship
and
men
to
row
it
so
on
the
next
day
we
put
forth
from
the
land
of
hurn
in
a
boat
that
the
fisher
folk
use
and
with
us
came
four
of
the
fisher
folk
who
rowed
the
boat
while
i
held
the
rudder
but
kithneb
sat
and
spake
not
in
the
prow
and
we
rowed
westward
up
the
coast
till
we
came
at
evening
where
the
cliffs
turned
southward
and
the
twilight
gleamed
upon
them
and
the
sea
there
we
turned
southwards
and
saw
at
once
brimdono
and
as
a
man
tears
the
purple
cloak
of
a
king
slain
in
battle
to
divide
it
with
other
warriors
brimdono
tore
the
sea
and
ever
around
and
around
him
with
a
gnarled
hand
brimdono
whirled
the
sail
of
some
adventurous
ship
the
trophy
of
some
calamity
wrought
in
his
greed
for
shipwreck
long
ago
where
he
sat
to
guard
his
masters
from
all
who
fare
on
the
sea
and
ever
one
empty
hand
swung
up
and
down
so
that
we
durst
go
no
nearer
only
kithneb
neither
saw
brimdono
nor
heard
his
roar
and
when
we
would
go
no
further
bade
us
lower
a
small
boat
with
oars
out
of
the
ship
into
this
boat
kithneb
descended
not
heeding
words
from
us
and
onward
rowed
alone
a
cry
of
triumph
over
ships
and
men
brimdono
uttered
before
him
but
kithneb
eyes
were
turned
toward
the
forest
as
he
came
behind
the
gods
upon
his
face
the
twilight
beat
full
from
the
haunts
of
evening
to
illumine
the
smiles
that
grew
about
his
eyes
as
he
came
behind
the
gods
him
that
had
found
the
gods
above
their
twilit
cliffs
him
that
had
heard
their
voices
close
at
last
and
knew
their
meaning
clear
him
from
the
cheerless
world
with
its
doubtings
and
prophets
that
lie
from
all
hidden
meanings
where
truth
rang
clear
at
last
brimdono
took
but
when
paharn
ceased
to
speak
in
the
king
ears
the
roar
of
brimdono
exulting
over
ancient
triumphs
and
the
whelming
of
ships
seemed
still
to
ring
then
mohontis
spake
the
hermit
prophet
who
lived
in
the
deep
untravelled
woods
that
seclude
lake
ilana
i
dreamed
that
to
the
west
of
all
the
seas
i
saw
by
vision
the
mouth
of
guarded
by
golden
gates
and
through
the
bars
of
the
gates
that
guard
the
mysterious
river
of
i
saw
the
flashes
of
golden
barques
wherein
the
gods
went
up
and
down
and
to
and
fro
through
the
evening
dusk
and
i
saw
that
was
a
river
of
dreams
such
as
came
through
remembered
gardens
in
the
night
to
charm
our
infancy
as
we
slept
beneath
the
sloping
gables
of
the
houses
of
long
ago
and
rolled
down
her
dreams
from
the
unknown
inner
land
and
slid
them
under
the
golden
gates
and
out
into
the
waste
unheeding
sea
till
they
beat
far
off
upon
shores
and
murmured
songs
of
long
ago
to
the
islands
of
the
south
or
shouted
tumultuous
paeans
to
the
northern
crags
or
cried
forlornly
against
rocks
where
no
one
came
dreams
that
might
not
be
dreamed
many
gods
there
be
that
through
the
dusk
of
an
evening
in
the
summer
go
up
and
down
this
river
there
i
saw
in
a
high
barque
all
of
gold
gods
the
of
the
pomp
of
cities
there
i
saw
gods
of
splendour
in
boats
bejewelled
to
the
keels
gods
of
magnificence
and
gods
of
power
i
saw
the
dark
ships
and
the
glint
of
steel
of
the
gods
whose
trade
was
war
and
i
heard
the
melody
of
the
bells
of
silver
arow
in
the
rigging
of
harpstrings
as
the
gods
of
melody
went
sailing
through
the
dusk
on
the
river
of
munra
o
wonderful
river
of
munra
o
i
saw
a
grey
ship
with
sails
of
the
spider
web
all
lit
with
dewdrop
lanterns
and
on
its
prow
was
a
scarlet
cock
with
its
wings
spread
far
and
wide
when
the
gods
of
the
dawn
sailed
also
on
down
this
river
it
is
the
wont
of
the
gods
to
carry
the
souls
of
men
eastward
to
where
the
world
in
the
distance
faces
on
then
i
knew
that
when
the
gods
of
the
pride
of
power
and
gods
of
the
pomp
of
cities
went
down
the
river
in
their
tall
gold
ships
to
take
earthward
other
souls
swiftly
adown
the
river
and
between
the
ships
had
gone
in
this
boat
of
birch
bark
the
god
tarn
the
hunter
bearing
my
soul
to
the
world
and
i
know
now
that
he
came
down
the
stream
in
the
dusk
keeping
well
to
the
middle
and
that
he
moved
silently
and
swiftly
among
the
ships
wielding
a
oar
i
remember
now
the
yellow
gleaming
of
the
great
boats
of
the
gods
of
the
pomp
of
cities
and
the
huge
prow
above
me
of
the
gods
of
the
pride
of
power
when
tarn
dipping
his
right
blade
into
the
river
lifted
his
left
blade
high
and
the
drops
gleamed
and
fell
thus
tarn
the
hunter
took
me
to
the
world
that
faces
across
the
sea
of
the
west
on
the
gate
of
and
so
it
was
that
there
grew
upon
me
the
glamour
of
the
hunt
though
i
had
forgotten
tarn
and
took
me
into
mossy
places
and
into
dark
woods
and
i
became
the
cousin
of
the
wolf
and
looked
into
the
lynx
eyes
and
knew
the
bear
and
the
birds
called
to
me
with
notes
and
there
grew
in
me
a
deep
love
of
great
rivers
and
of
all
western
seas
and
a
distrust
of
cities
and
all
the
while
i
had
forgotten
tarn
i
know
not
what
high
galleon
shall
come
for
thee
o
king
nor
what
rowers
clad
with
purple
shall
row
at
the
bidding
of
gods
when
thou
goest
back
with
pomp
to
the
river
of
but
for
me
tarn
waits
where
the
seas
of
the
west
break
over
the
edge
of
the
world
and
as
the
years
pass
over
me
and
the
love
of
the
chase
sinks
low
and
as
the
glamour
of
the
dark
woods
and
mossy
places
dies
down
in
my
soul
ever
louder
and
louder
lap
the
ripples
against
the
canoe
of
birch
bark
where
holding
his
oar
tarn
waits
but
when
my
soul
hath
no
more
knowledge
of
the
woods
nor
kindred
any
longer
with
the
creatures
of
the
dark
and
when
all
that
tarn
hath
given
it
shall
be
lost
then
tarn
shall
take
me
back
over
the
western
seas
where
all
the
remembered
years
lie
floating
idly
aswing
with
the
ebb
and
flow
to
bring
me
again
to
the
river
of
far
up
that
river
we
shall
haply
chase
those
creatures
whose
eyes
are
peering
in
the
night
as
they
prowl
around
the
world
for
tarn
was
ever
a
hunter
then
ulf
spake
the
prophet
who
in
sistrameides
lives
in
a
temple
anciently
dedicated
to
the
gods
rumour
hath
guessed
that
there
the
gods
walked
once
some
time
towards
evening
but
time
whose
hand
is
against
the
temples
of
the
gods
hath
dealt
harshly
with
it
and
overturned
its
pillars
and
set
upon
its
ruins
his
sign
and
seal
now
ulf
dwells
there
alone
and
ulf
said
there
sets
o
king
a
river
outward
from
earth
which
meets
with
a
mighty
sea
whose
waters
roll
through
space
and
fling
their
billows
on
the
shores
of
every
star
these
are
the
river
and
the
sea
of
the
tears
of
men
and
the
king
said
men
have
not
written
of
this
sea
and
the
prophet
answered
have
not
tears
enough
burst
in
the
night
time
out
of
sleeping
cities
have
not
the
sorrows
of
homes
sent
streams
into
this
river
when
twilight
fell
and
it
was
still
and
there
was
none
to
hear
have
there
not
been
hopes
and
were
they
all
fulfilled
have
there
not
been
conquests
and
bitter
defeats
and
have
not
flowers
when
spring
was
over
died
in
the
gardens
of
many
children
tears
enough
o
king
tears
enough
have
gone
down
out
of
earth
to
make
such
a
sea
and
deep
it
is
and
wide
and
the
gods
know
it
and
it
flings
its
spray
on
the
shores
of
all
the
stars
down
this
river
and
across
this
sea
thou
shalt
fare
in
a
ship
of
sighs
and
all
around
thee
over
the
sea
shall
fly
the
prayers
of
men
which
rise
on
white
wings
higher
than
their
sorrows
sometimes
perched
in
the
rigging
sometimes
crying
around
thee
shall
go
the
prayers
that
availed
not
to
stay
thee
in
zarkandhu
far
over
the
waters
and
on
the
wings
of
the
prayers
beats
the
light
of
an
inaccessible
star
no
hand
hath
touched
it
none
hath
journeyed
to
it
it
hath
no
substance
it
is
only
a
light
it
is
the
star
of
hope
and
it
shines
far
over
the
sea
and
brightens
the
world
it
is
nought
but
a
light
but
the
gods
gave
it
led
only
by
the
light
of
this
star
the
myriad
prayers
that
thou
shalt
see
all
around
thee
fly
to
the
hall
of
the
gods
sighs
shall
waft
thy
ship
of
sighs
over
the
sea
of
tears
thou
shalt
pass
by
islands
of
laughter
and
lands
of
song
lying
low
in
the
sea
and
all
of
them
drenched
with
tears
flung
over
their
rocks
by
the
waves
of
the
sea
all
driven
by
the
sighs
but
at
last
thou
shalt
come
with
the
prayers
of
men
to
the
great
hall
of
the
gods
where
the
chairs
of
the
gods
are
carved
of
onyx
grouped
round
the
golden
throne
of
the
eldest
of
the
gods
and
there
o
king
hope
not
to
find
the
gods
but
reclining
upon
the
golden
throne
wearing
a
cloak
of
his
master
thou
shalt
see
the
figure
of
time
with
blood
upon
his
hands
and
loosely
dangling
from
his
fingers
a
dripping
sword
and
spattered
with
blood
but
empty
shall
stand
the
onyx
chairs
there
he
sits
on
his
master
throne
dangling
idly
his
sword
or
with
it
flicking
cruelly
at
the
prayers
of
men
that
lie
in
a
great
heap
bleeding
at
his
feet
for
a
while
o
king
the
gods
had
sought
to
solve
the
riddles
of
time
for
a
while
they
made
him
their
slave
and
time
smiled
and
obeyed
his
masters
for
a
while
o
king
for
a
while
he
that
hath
spared
nothing
hath
not
spared
the
gods
nor
yet
shall
he
spare
thee
then
the
king
spake
dolefully
in
the
hall
of
kings
and
said
may
i
not
find
at
last
the
gods
and
must
it
be
that
i
may
not
look
in
their
faces
at
the
last
to
see
whether
they
be
kindly
they
that
have
sent
me
on
my
earthward
journey
i
would
greet
on
my
returning
if
not
as
a
king
coming
again
to
his
own
city
yet
as
one
who
having
been
ordered
had
obeyed
and
obeying
had
merited
something
of
those
for
whom
he
toiled
i
would
look
them
in
their
faces
o
prophet
and
ask
them
concerning
many
things
and
would
know
the
wherefore
of
much
i
had
hoped
o
prophet
that
those
gods
that
had
smiled
upon
my
childhood
whose
voices
stirred
at
evening
in
gardens
when
i
was
young
would
hold
dominion
still
when
at
last
i
came
to
seek
them
o
prophet
if
this
is
not
to
be
make
you
a
great
dirge
for
my
childhood
gods
and
fashion
silver
bells
and
setting
them
mostly
amidst
such
trees
as
grew
in
the
garden
of
my
childhood
sing
you
this
dirge
in
the
dusk
and
sing
it
when
the
low
moth
flies
up
and
down
and
the
bat
first
comes
peering
from
her
home
sing
it
when
white
mists
come
rising
from
the
river
when
smoke
is
pale
and
grey
while
flowers
are
yet
closing
ere
voices
are
yet
hushed
sing
it
while
all
things
yet
lament
the
day
or
ever
the
great
lights
of
heaven
come
blazing
forth
and
night
with
her
splendours
takes
the
place
of
day
for
if
the
old
gods
die
let
us
lament
them
or
ever
new
knowledge
comes
while
all
the
world
still
shudders
at
their
loss
for
at
the
last
o
prophet
what
is
left
only
the
gods
of
my
childhood
dead
and
only
time
striding
large
and
lonely
through
the
spaces
chilling
the
moon
and
paling
the
light
of
stars
and
scattering
earthward
out
of
both
his
hands
the
dust
of
forgetfulness
over
the
fields
of
heroes
and
smitten
temples
of
the
older
gods
but
when
the
other
prophets
heard
with
what
doleful
words
the
king
spake
in
the
hall
they
all
cried
out
it
is
not
as
ulf
has
said
but
as
i
have
said
and
i
then
the
king
pondered
long
not
speaking
but
down
in
the
city
in
a
street
between
the
houses
stood
grouped
together
they
that
were
wont
to
dance
before
the
king
and
they
that
had
borne
his
wine
in
jewelled
cups
long
they
had
tarried
in
the
city
hoping
that
the
king
might
relent
and
once
again
regard
them
with
kindly
faces
calling
for
wine
and
song
the
next
morning
they
were
all
to
set
out
in
search
of
some
new
kingdom
and
they
were
peering
between
the
houses
and
up
the
long
grey
street
to
see
for
the
last
time
the
palace
of
king
ebalon
and
pattering
leaves
the
dancer
cried
not
any
more
not
any
more
at
all
shall
we
drift
up
the
carven
hall
to
dance
before
the
king
he
that
now
watches
the
magic
of
his
prophets
will
behold
no
more
the
wonder
of
the
dance
and
among
ancient
parchments
strange
and
wise
he
shall
forget
the
swirl
of
drapery
when
we
swing
together
through
the
dance
of
the
myriad
steps
and
with
her
were
silvern
fountain
and
summer
lightning
and
dream
of
the
sea
each
lamenting
that
they
should
dance
no
more
to
please
the
eyes
of
the
king
and
intahn
who
had
carried
at
the
banquet
for
fifty
years
the
goblet
of
the
king
set
with
its
four
sapphires
each
as
large
as
an
eye
said
as
he
spread
his
hands
towards
the
palace
making
the
sign
of
farewell
not
all
the
magic
of
prophecy
nor
yet
foreseeing
nor
perceiving
may
equal
the
power
of
wine
through
the
small
door
in
the
king
hall
one
goes
by
one
hundred
steps
and
many
sloping
corridors
into
the
cool
of
the
earth
where
lies
a
cavern
vaster
than
the
hall
therein
curtained
by
the
spider
repose
the
casks
of
wine
that
are
wont
to
gladden
the
hearts
of
the
kings
of
zarkandhu
in
islands
far
to
the
eastward
the
vine
from
whose
heart
this
wine
was
long
since
wrung
hath
climbed
aloft
with
many
a
clutching
finger
and
beheld
the
sea
and
ships
of
the
olden
time
and
men
since
dead
and
gone
down
into
the
earth
again
and
been
covered
over
with
weeds
and
green
with
the
damp
of
years
there
lie
three
casks
that
a
city
gave
not
up
until
all
her
defenders
were
slain
and
her
houses
fired
and
ever
to
the
soul
of
that
wine
is
added
a
more
ardent
fire
as
ever
the
years
go
by
thither
it
was
my
pride
to
go
before
a
banquet
in
the
olden
years
and
coming
up
to
bear
in
the
sapphire
goblet
the
fire
of
the
elder
kings
and
to
watch
the
king
eye
flash
and
his
face
grow
nobler
and
more
like
his
sires
as
he
drank
the
gleaming
wine
and
now
the
king
seeks
wisdom
from
his
prophets
while
all
the
glory
of
the
past
and
all
the
clattering
splendour
of
today
grows
old
far
down
forgotten
beneath
his
feet
and
when
he
ceased
the
cupbearers
and
the
women
that
danced
looked
long
in
silence
at
the
palace
then
one
by
one
all
made
the
farewell
sign
before
they
turned
to
go
and
as
they
did
this
a
herald
unseen
in
the
dark
was
speeding
towards
them
after
a
long
silence
the
king
spake
prophets
of
my
kingdom
he
said
you
have
not
prophesied
alike
and
the
words
of
each
prophet
condemn
his
fellows
words
so
that
wisdom
may
not
be
discovered
among
prophets
but
i
command
that
none
in
my
kingdom
shall
doubt
that
the
earliest
king
of
zarkandhu
stored
wine
beneath
this
palace
before
the
building
of
the
city
or
ever
the
palace
arose
and
i
shall
cause
commands
to
be
uttered
for
the
making
of
a
banquet
at
once
within
this
hall
so
that
ye
shall
perceive
that
the
power
of
my
wine
is
greater
than
all
your
spells
and
dancing
more
wondrous
than
prophecy
the
dancers
and
the
winebearers
were
summoned
back
and
as
the
night
wore
on
a
banquet
was
spread
and
all
the
prophets
bidden
to
be
seated
samahn
ynath
monith
ynar
thun
the
prophet
of
journeys
zornadhu
yamen
paharn
ilana
ulf
and
one
that
had
not
spoken
nor
yet
revealed
his
name
and
who
wore
his
prophet
cloak
across
his
face
and
the
prophets
feasted
as
they
were
commanded
and
spake
as
other
men
spake
save
he
whose
face
was
hidden
who
neither
ate
nor
spake
once
he
put
out
his
hand
from
under
his
cloak
and
touched
a
blossom
among
the
flowers
upon
the
table
and
the
blossom
fell
and
pattering
leaves
came
in
and
danced
again
and
the
king
smiled
and
pattering
leaves
was
happy
though
she
had
not
the
wisdom
of
the
prophets
and
in
and
out
in
and
out
in
and
out
among
the
columns
of
the
hall
went
summer
lightning
in
the
maze
of
the
dance
and
silvern
fountain
bowed
before
the
king
and
danced
and
danced
and
bowed
again
and
old
intahn
went
to
and
fro
from
the
cavern
to
the
king
gravely
through
the
midst
of
the
dancers
but
with
kindly
eyes
and
when
the
king
had
often
drunk
of
the
old
wine
of
the
elder
kings
he
called
for
dream
of
the
sea
and
bade
her
sing
and
dream
of
the
sea
came
through
the
arches
and
sang
of
an
island
builded
by
magic
out
of
pearls
that
lay
set
in
a
ruby
sea
and
how
it
lay
far
off
and
under
the
south
guarded
by
jagged
reefs
whereon
the
sorrows
of
the
world
were
wrecked
and
never
came
to
the
island
and
how
a
low
sunset
always
reddened
the
sea
and
lit
the
magic
isle
and
never
turned
to
night
and
how
someone
sang
always
and
endlessly
to
lure
the
soul
of
a
king
who
might
by
enchantment
pass
the
guarding
reefs
to
find
rest
on
the
pearl
island
and
not
be
troubled
more
but
only
see
sorrows
on
the
outer
reef
battered
and
broken
then
soul
of
the
south
rose
up
and
sang
a
song
of
a
fountain
that
ever
sought
to
reach
the
sky
and
was
ever
doomed
to
fall
to
the
earth
again
until
at
last
then
whether
it
was
the
art
of
pattering
leaves
or
the
song
of
dream
of
the
sea
or
whether
it
was
the
fire
of
the
wine
of
the
elder
kings
ebalon
bade
farewell
kindly
to
the
prophets
when
morning
paled
the
stars
then
along
the
torchlit
corridors
the
king
went
to
his
chamber
and
having
shut
the
door
in
the
empty
room
beheld
suddenly
a
figure
wearing
the
cloak
of
a
prophet
and
the
king
perceived
that
it
was
he
whose
face
was
hidden
at
the
banquet
who
had
not
revealed
his
name
and
the
king
said
art
thou
too
a
prophet
and
the
figure
answered
i
am
a
prophet
and
the
king
said
knowest
aught
concerning
the
journey
of
the
king
and
the
figure
answered
i
know
but
have
never
said
and
the
king
said
who
art
thou
that
knowest
so
much
and
has
not
told
it
and
he
answered
i
am
then
the
cloaked
figure
strode
away
from
the
palace
and
the
king
unseen
by
the
guards
followed
upon
his
journey
the
end
