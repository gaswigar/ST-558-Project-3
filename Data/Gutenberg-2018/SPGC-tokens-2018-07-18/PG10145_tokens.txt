what
is
turkey
it
is
a
name
which
explains
nothing
for
no
formula
can
embrace
the
variety
of
the
countries
marked
ottoman
on
the
map
the
high
yemen
with
its
monsoons
and
tropical
cultivation
the
tilted
rim
of
the
hedjaz
one
desert
in
a
desert
zone
that
stretches
from
the
sahara
to
mongolia
the
mesopotamian
rivers
breaking
the
desert
with
a
strip
of
green
the
mountain
terraces
of
kurdistan
which
gird
in
mesopotamia
as
the
hills
of
the
frontier
of
india
gird
the
plains
the
armenian
highlands
bleak
as
the
pamirs
which
feed
mesopotamia
with
their
snows
and
send
it
the
soil
they
can
not
keep
themselves
the
anatolian
peninsula
an
offshoot
of
central
europe
with
its
rocks
and
fine
timber
and
mountain
streams
but
nursing
a
steppe
in
its
heart
more
intractable
than
the
puszta
of
hungary
the
trebizond
and
ismid
and
smyrna
clinging
to
the
anatolian
mainland
and
syria
interposing
itself
between
the
desert
and
the
sea
but
all
with
their
vines
and
olives
and
sharp
contours
keeping
true
to
the
mediterranean
and
then
the
waterway
of
narrows
and
sea
and
narrows
again
which
links
the
mediterranean
with
the
black
sea
and
the
russian
hinterland
and
which
has
not
its
like
in
the
world
the
cities
of
turkey
are
as
various
as
the
climes
with
the
added
impress
of
many
generations
of
men
adrianople
set
at
a
junction
of
rivers
within
the
circle
of
the
thracian
downs
a
fortress
since
its
foundation
well
chosen
for
the
tombs
of
the
ottoman
conquerors
constantinople
capital
of
empires
where
races
meet
but
never
mix
mistress
of
trade
routes
vital
to
the
existence
of
vast
regions
beyond
her
horizon
central
europe
trafficking
overland
and
russia
by
sea
smyrna
the
port
by
which
men
go
up
and
down
between
anatolia
and
the
aegean
the
foothold
on
the
asiatic
mainland
which
the
greeks
have
never
lost
konia
between
the
mountain
girdle
and
the
central
steppe
where
native
anatolia
has
always
stood
at
bay
guarding
her
race
and
religion
against
the
influences
of
the
coasts
aleppo
where
if
turkey
were
a
unity
the
centre
of
turkey
would
be
found
the
city
where
if
anywhere
the
races
of
the
near
east
have
mingled
building
their
courses
into
her
fortress
walls
from
the
polygonal
work
of
the
hittite
founders
to
the
battlements
that
kept
out
the
crusaders
and
now
the
point
of
a
railway
surveyed
along
an
immemorially
ancient
route
but
unfinished
like
the
history
of
aleppo
herself
van
by
its
upland
lake
overhanging
the
mesopotamian
lowlands
and
with
the
writing
of
their
culture
graven
on
its
cliffs
yet
living
a
life
apart
like
some
swiss
canton
and
half
belonging
to
the
infinite
north
bagdad
the
incarnation
for
the
last
millennium
of
an
eternal
city
that
shifts
its
site
as
its
rivers
shift
their
beds
from
seleucia
to
bagdad
from
babylon
to
seleucia
from
kish
to
babylon
but
which
always
springs
up
again
like
delhi
within
a
few
parasangs
of
its
last
ruins
in
an
area
that
is
an
irresistible
focus
of
population
basra
amid
its
so
far
down
stream
that
it
belongs
to
the
indian
ocean
the
port
from
which
sinbad
set
sail
for
fairyland
and
from
which
less
mythical
arab
seamen
spread
their
religion
and
civilisation
far
over
african
coasts
and
malayan
indies
these
and
besides
them
almost
all
the
holy
cities
of
mankind
kerbela
between
the
euphrates
and
the
desert
where
under
sunni
rule
the
shias
of
persia
and
india
have
still
visited
the
tombs
of
their
saints
and
buried
their
dead
jerusalem
where
jew
and
christian
orthodox
catholic
and
protestant
armenian
and
abyssinian
have
their
common
shrines
and
separate
quarters
mekka
and
medina
in
the
heart
of
the
desert
beyond
which
their
fame
would
never
have
passed
but
for
a
well
and
a
mart
and
a
precinct
of
idols
and
the
prophet
who
overthrew
them
and
there
are
the
cities
on
the
pilgrim
road
linked
now
by
railway
with
medina
the
nearer
of
the
beirűt
the
port
with
its
electric
trams
and
newspapers
the
smyrna
of
the
arab
lands
and
damascus
the
oasis
looking
out
over
the
desert
instead
of
the
sea
and
harbour
not
of
ships
but
of
the
names
of
these
cities
call
up
like
an
incantation
the
memory
of
the
civilisations
which
grew
in
them
to
greatness
and
sank
in
them
to
decay
mesopotamia
a
great
heart
of
civilisation
which
is
cold
but
which
beat
so
strongly
for
five
thousand
years
that
its
pulses
were
felt
from
siberia
to
the
pillars
of
hercules
and
influenced
the
taste
and
technique
of
the
scandinavian
bronze
age
the
assyrians
who
extended
the
political
marches
of
mesopotamia
towards
the
north
and
turned
them
into
a
military
monarchy
that
devastated
the
motherland
and
all
other
lands
and
peoples
from
the
tigris
to
the
sea
the
hebrews
discovering
a
in
their
overlooking
the
coast
the
sabaeans
whose
queen
made
the
first
pilgrimage
to
jerusalem
coming
from
yemen
across
the
hedjaz
when
mekka
and
medina
were
still
of
no
account
the
philistines
and
phoenicians
of
the
syrian
who
were
discovering
the
atlantic
and
were
too
busy
to
listen
to
the
hebrew
prophets
in
their
hinterland
the
ionians
who
opened
up
the
black
sea
and
created
a
poetry
philosophy
science
and
architecture
which
are
still
the
of
ours
before
they
were
overwhelmed
like
the
phoenicians
before
them
by
a
continental
military
power
the
hittites
who
first
transmitted
the
fruitful
influences
of
mesopotamia
to
the
ionian
coasts
a
people
as
mysterious
to
their
contemporaries
as
to
ourselves
maturing
unknown
in
the
fastnesses
of
anatolia
raising
up
a
sudden
empire
that
raided
mesopotamia
and
colonised
the
syrian
valleys
and
then
succumbing
to
waves
of
northern
invasion
all
these
people
rose
and
fell
within
the
boundaries
of
turkey
held
the
stage
of
the
world
for
a
time
and
left
their
mark
on
its
history
there
is
a
romance
about
their
names
a
wonderful
variety
and
intensity
in
their
vanished
life
yet
they
are
not
more
diverse
than
their
modern
successors
in
whose
veins
flows
their
blood
and
whose
possibilities
are
only
dwarfed
by
their
achievements
there
were
less
than
twenty
million
people
in
turkey
before
the
war
and
during
it
the
government
has
caused
a
million
or
so
to
perish
by
massacre
starvation
or
disease
yet
in
spite
of
this
daemoniac
effort
after
uniformity
they
are
still
the
strangest
congeries
of
racial
and
social
types
that
has
ever
been
placed
at
a
single
government
mercy
the
ottoman
empire
is
named
after
the
osmanli
but
you
might
search
long
before
you
found
one
among
its
inhabitants
these
osmanlis
are
a
governing
class
indigenous
only
in
constantinople
and
a
few
neighbouring
towns
but
planted
here
and
there
as
officers
and
officials
over
the
ottoman
territories
they
come
of
a
clan
of
turkish
nomads
recruited
since
the
thirteenth
century
by
converts
forced
or
voluntary
from
most
of
christendom
and
crossed
with
the
blood
of
from
all
the
world
they
are
hardly
a
race
tradition
fortified
by
inertia
makes
them
what
they
are
and
also
their
turkish
language
which
serves
them
for
business
of
state
and
for
a
literature
though
not
without
an
infusion
of
persian
and
arabic
idioms
said
to
amount
to
per
cent
of
the
vocabulary
this
artificial
language
is
hardly
a
link
between
osmanli
officialdom
and
the
turkish
peasantry
of
anatolia
which
speaks
turkish
dialects
derived
from
tribes
that
drifted
in
some
as
late
as
the
osmanlis
some
two
centuries
before
nor
has
this
peasantry
much
in
common
with
the
turkish
nomads
who
still
wander
over
the
central
anatolian
steppe
and
have
kept
their
blood
pure
for
the
peasantry
has
reverted
physically
to
the
native
stock
which
held
anatolia
from
time
immemorial
and
absorbs
all
newcomers
that
mingle
with
it
on
its
soil
thus
there
are
three
distinct
turkish
elements
in
turkey
divided
by
blood
and
vocation
and
social
type
and
even
if
we
reckon
all
who
speak
some
form
of
turkish
as
one
group
they
only
amount
to
or
per
cent
of
the
whole
population
of
the
empire
the
rest
are
alien
to
the
turks
and
to
one
another
those
who
speak
arabic
are
as
strong
numerically
as
the
turks
or
stronger
but
they
too
are
divided
and
their
unity
is
a
problem
of
the
future
there
are
arab
nomads
of
the
desert
there
are
arabs
who
have
settled
in
towns
or
on
the
land
some
within
the
last
generation
like
the
muntefik
in
mesopotamia
some
a
millennium
or
two
ago
like
the
meccan
koreish
but
who
still
retain
their
tribal
consciousness
of
race
there
are
arabs
in
name
who
have
nothing
arabic
about
them
but
their
language
most
of
the
peasantry
of
syria
are
such
and
the
inhabitants
of
ancient
centres
of
population
like
damascus
or
bagdad
in
syria
many
of
these
arabs
are
christians
and
some
christians
though
they
speak
arabic
have
retained
their
separate
sense
of
nationality
notably
the
roman
catholic
maronites
of
the
lebanon
and
would
hardly
be
considered
as
arabs
either
by
themselves
or
by
their
neighbours
the
same
is
true
of
the
druses
another
remnant
of
an
earlier
stock
which
has
preserved
its
identity
under
the
guise
of
islam
so
heretically
conceived
as
to
rank
as
an
independent
religion
as
for
the
yemenis
they
will
resent
the
imputation
for
no
arabs
count
up
their
genealogies
so
zealously
as
they
but
there
is
more
east
african
than
semitic
blood
in
their
veins
they
are
men
of
the
moist
fertile
tropics
brown
of
skin
and
working
half
naked
in
their
fields
like
the
peoples
of
southern
india
and
bengal
and
on
the
opposite
fringes
of
the
area
there
are
fragments
of
population
whose
language
is
semitic
but
the
jacobite
christians
of
the
and
the
nestorians
of
the
upper
zab
who
once
under
the
caliphs
were
the
industrious
christian
peasantry
of
mesopotamia
but
now
are
shepherds
and
hillmen
among
the
kurds
the
kurds
themselves
are
more
scattered
than
any
other
stock
in
turkey
and
divided
tribe
against
tribe
but
taken
together
they
rank
third
in
numerical
strength
after
the
arabs
and
turks
there
are
mountain
kurds
and
kurds
of
the
plain
husbandmen
and
herdsmen
kurds
who
have
kept
to
their
original
homes
along
the
eastern
frontier
and
kurds
who
under
ottoman
auspices
have
spread
themselves
over
the
armenian
plateau
the
north
mesopotamian
steppes
the
taurus
valleys
and
the
hinterland
of
the
black
sea
the
chief
thing
the
kurds
have
in
common
is
the
persian
dialect
they
speak
but
it
is
usual
to
class
as
kurds
any
and
every
community
in
the
kurdish
area
which
is
not
turkish
or
arab
and
can
by
courtesy
be
called
moslem
the
kurds
for
that
matter
are
only
moslems
such
communities
abound
the
dersim
highlands
in
particular
are
an
ethnographical
museum
is
a
general
name
for
their
kind
only
the
yezidis
though
they
speak
good
kurdish
are
distinguished
from
the
rest
for
their
idiosyncrasy
of
worshipping
satan
under
the
form
of
a
peacock
allah
they
argue
is
and
does
not
need
to
be
propitiated
and
they
are
repudiated
with
one
accord
by
moslem
and
christian
but
not
all
the
scattered
elements
in
turkey
are
isolated
or
primitive
the
greeks
and
armenians
for
instance
are
or
were
the
most
energetic
intellectual
liberal
elements
in
turkey
the
natural
intermediaries
between
the
other
races
and
western
civilisation
were
rather
than
are
because
the
ottoman
government
has
taken
ruthless
steps
to
eliminate
just
these
two
most
valuable
elements
among
its
subjects
the
urban
greeks
survive
in
centres
like
smyrna
and
constantinople
but
the
greek
peasantry
of
thrace
and
anatolia
has
mostly
been
driven
over
the
frontier
since
the
second
balkan
war
as
for
the
armenians
the
government
has
been
destroying
them
by
massacre
and
deportation
since
april
business
and
professional
men
peasants
and
shepherds
women
and
children
without
discrimination
or
pity
a
third
of
the
ottoman
armenians
may
still
survive
a
tenth
of
them
are
safe
within
the
russian
and
british
lines
fortunately
half
this
nation
and
the
majority
of
the
greeks
live
outside
the
ottoman
frontiers
and
are
beyond
the
osmanli
power
to
compensate
for
its
depopulation
of
the
countries
under
its
dominion
the
ottoman
government
during
the
last
fifty
years
has
been
settling
them
with
moslem
immigrants
from
its
own
lost
provinces
or
from
other
moslem
lands
that
have
changed
their
rulers
these
mouhadjirs
are
reckoned
from
first
to
last
at
of
a
million
drawn
from
the
most
diverse
stocks
bosniaks
and
pomaks
and
albanians
algerines
and
tripolitans
tchetchens
and
circassians
numbers
have
been
planted
recently
on
the
lands
of
dispossessed
armenians
and
greeks
they
add
many
more
elements
to
the
confusion
of
tongues
but
they
are
probably
destined
to
be
absorbed
or
to
die
out
the
circassians
in
particular
who
are
the
most
industrious
though
most
unruly
and
preserve
their
nationality
best
also
succumb
most
easily
to
transplantation
through
refusal
to
adapt
their
caucasian
clothes
and
habits
to
anatolian
or
mesopotamian
conditions
of
life
all
this
is
turkey
and
we
come
back
to
our
original
question
what
common
factor
accounts
for
the
name
what
has
stained
this
coat
of
many
colours
to
one
political
hue
the
answer
is
simple
blood
turkey
the
ottoman
state
is
not
a
unity
climatic
geographical
racial
or
economic
it
is
a
pretension
enforced
by
bloodshed
and
violence
whenever
and
wherever
the
osmanli
government
has
power
it
is
a
complex
pretension
the
first
impulse
and
the
traditional
method
by
which
it
has
been
given
effect
came
from
a
little
tribe
of
pagan
nomadic
turks
who
wandered
into
anatolia
from
central
asia
in
the
thirteenth
century
and
were
granted
camping
grounds
by
the
reigning
turkish
sultan
of
the
country
for
anatolia
was
already
turkish
two
centuries
before
the
osmanlis
appeared
on
the
scene
but
to
call
them
osmanlis
is
to
anticipate
the
next
stage
in
their
history
they
are
named
after
osman
their
first
leader
son
and
he
after
the
third
successor
of
the
prophet
it
was
a
good
moslem
name
and
he
took
it
when
he
was
converted
to
islam
and
organised
his
pagan
into
a
settled
mohammedan
state
in
the
hills
of
anatolia
on
the
borders
of
christendom
a
tribe
had
become
a
march
and
the
final
stage
was
from
march
to
empire
from
this
point
onwards
ottoman
history
singularly
resembles
the
history
of
the
osmanlis
present
allies
the
march
of
brandenburg
the
march
of
austria
and
the
march
of
osman
they
were
each
founded
as
the
outer
bulwarks
of
a
civilisation
and
all
erected
themselves
into
centres
of
military
ascendancy
over
their
and
to
the
rear
as
well
as
the
strangers
opposite
their
front
the
osmanlis
may
have
been
more
savage
in
their
methods
than
the
marchmen
of
germany
though
hardly
perhaps
than
the
teutonic
knights
who
prepared
the
soil
of
prussia
for
the
hohenzollerns
the
teutonic
knights
exterminated
their
victims
the
osmanlis
drained
theirs
of
their
blood
by
taking
a
tribute
of
their
male
children
educating
them
as
moslems
and
training
them
as
recruits
for
an
ottoman
standing
army
their
first
expansion
was
forwards
into
christian
europe
their
capital
shifted
from
a
village
in
the
hills
to
the
city
of
brusa
on
the
asiatic
shore
of
marmora
from
brusa
across
the
dardanelles
to
adrianople
from
adrianople
to
the
imperial
city
on
the
bosphorus
and
with
the
capture
of
constantinople
the
osmanli
sultans
usurped
the
pretensions
of
east
rome
as
the
hapsburgs
and
hohenzollerns
the
emblems
of
charlemagne
and
caesar
augustus
byzantium
has
become
a
very
potent
element
in
the
osmanlis
character
more
potent
than
the
habits
of
the
march
or
the
instinct
of
the

it
has
dictated
their

of
administration
dominated
their
outlook

penetrated
their

but
the
heritage
of
rűm
is
not
the
final
factor
in
the
ottoman
empire
as
it
exists
for
after
the
successors
of
osman
had
founded
their
military
monarchy
with
blood
and
iron
on
the
ruins
of
of
europe
they
turned
eastwards
with
a
genuinely
oriental
gesture
and
overran
kingdoms
and
lands
with
the
apparently
mechanical
impetus
of
all
asiatic
conquerors
from
sargon
of
akkad
and
cyrus
the
persian
to
jenghis
khan
and
timur
the
stoutest
opponent
of
the
osmanlis
in
asia
was
the
anatolian
sultanate
of
karaman
moslem
turkish
and
the
legitimate
heir
of
those
seljuk
turkish
sultans
who
had
given
osman
father
his
first
footing
in
the
land
osmanli
and
karamanli
fought
on
equal
terms
but
when
karaman
was
overthrown
there
was
no
power
left
in
asia
that
could
stop
the
advance
the
egyptians
and
persians
had
no
more
chance
against
ottoman
discipline
and
artillery
than
the
last
darius
had
against
the
macedonians
a
campaign
or
two
brought
sultan
selim
the
first
from
the
taurus
to
cairo
a
few
more
campaigns
at
intervals
during
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
when
ottoman
armies
could
be
spared
from
europe
drove
the
persians
successively
out
of
armenia
and
mosul
and
bagdad
and
thus
by
accident
as
it
were
in
the
pursuit
of
more
coveted
things
the
osmanlis
acquired
which
is
all
that
remains
to
them
now
and
all
that
concerns
us
here
is
a
transitory
phenomenon
a
sort
of
chrysalis
which
enshrouded
the
countries
of
western
asia
because
they
were
exhausted
and
needed
torpor
as
a
preliminary
to
recuperation
many
calamities
had
fallen
upon
them
during
the
five
centuries
before
the
chrysalis
formed
the
of
the
arab
caliphate
of
bagdad
had
led
to
an
interminable
meaningless
conflict
among
a
host
of
petty
moslem
states
the
wearing
struggle
between
islam
and
christendom
had
been
intensified
by
the
crusades
and
waves
of
nomadic
invaders
each
more
destructive
and
more
irresistible
than
the
last
had
swept
over
moslem
asia
out
of
the
steppes
and
deserts
of
the
the
most
terrible
were
the
mongols
who
sacked
bagdad
in
and
gave
the
de
to
the
civilisation
of
mesopotamia
and
then
when
the
native
productiveness
of
the
near
east
was
ruined
the
transit
trade
between
europe
and
the
indies
which
had
belonged
to
it
from
the
earliest
times
and
had
been
the
second
source
of
its
prosperity
was
taken
from
it
by
the
western
seafarers
who
discovered
the
ocean
routes
the
pall
of
ottoman
dominion
only
descended
when
life
was
extinct
the
osmanlis
whose
nomadic
forefathers
had
fled
before
the
face
of
the
mongols
out
of
central
asia
took
the
heritage
which
had
slipped
from
the
mongols
grasp
and
gathered
all
threads
of
authority
in
western
asia
into
their
hands
the
most
valuable
spoil
of
their
asiatic
conquests
was
the
caliphate
hulaku
the
sacker
of
bagdad
had
put
the
caliph
mustasim
to
death
and
the
remnant
of
the
abbasids
had
kept
up
a
shadowy
succession
at
cairo
under
the
protection
of
the
sultan
of
egypt
selim
the
osmanli
when
he
entered
cairo
as
a
conqueror
in
caused
the
contemporary
abbasid
to
cede
his
title
for
what
it
was
worth
to
him
and
his
successors
it
was
a
doubtful
title
scorned
by
all
shias
and
regarded
coldly
by
many
sunni
rulers
who
were
unwilling
to
recognise
a
spiritual
superior
in
their
most
formidable
temporal
rival
but
such
as
it
was
it
strengthened
the
osmanli
hold
on
his
dominions
caliph
of
islam
victorious
guardian
of
the
moslem
marches
and
heir
by
conquest
of
imperial
rűm
the
osmanli
sultan
held
his
asiatic
provinces
with
ease
but
the
best
security
for
his
tenure
was
the
misery
to
which
they
were
reduced
commerce
and
cultivation
ebbed
population
dwindled
and
nomads
still
drifted
in
upon
what
once
had
been
settled
lands
the
ottoman
government
desiring
a
barrier
against
persia
encouraged
the
kurds
to
spread
themselves
over
armenia
it
welcomed
less
the
shammar
and
anazeh
arabs
who
broke
over
the
euphrates
about
the
year
and
turned
the
last
fields
of
northern
mesopotamia
to
desolation
but
it
was
too
impotent
or
indifferent
to
turn
them
out
western
asia
lay
fallow
under
the
ottoman
there
have
been
fallow
periods
before
in
the
slow
rhythm
of
its
life
under
the
persians
for
instance
who
overran
all
lands
and
peoples
of
the
east
in
the
sixth
century
overshadowed
the
greeks
for
a
moment
as
the
osmanlis
overshadowed
europe
halted
too
massive
for
offence
but
seemingly
unassailable
and
then
collapsed
pitifully
before
the
probing
spears
of
alexander
the
osmanlis
are
passing
at
this
moment
as
the
achaemenids
passed
then
they
lost
the
last
of
europe
in
the
balkan
war
and
with
it
their
prestige
as
increasers
of
islam
the
growth
of
national
consciousness
among
their
subjects
not
least
among
the
turks
themselves
has
loosened
the
foundations
of
their
military
empire
as
of
the
other
military
empires
with
which
they
are
allied
they
forfeited
the
caliphate
when
they
proclaimed
the
holy
war
against
the
allied
powers
inciting
moslems
to
join
one
christian
coalition
against
another
not
in
defence
of
their
religion
but
for
ottoman
political
aggrandisement
they
lost
it
morally
when
this
incitement
was
left
unheeded
by
the
moslem
world
they
lost
it
in
deed
when
the
sherif
of
mekka
asserted
his
rights
as
the
legitimate
guardian
of
the
holy
cities
drove
out
the
ottoman
garrison
from
mekka
and
allied
himself
with
the
other
independent
princes
of
arabia
all
the
props
of
ottoman
dominion
in
asia
have
fallen
away
but
nothing
dooms
it
so
surely
as
the
breath
of
life
that
is
stirring
over
the
dormant
lands
and
peoples
once
more
the
cutting
of
the
suez
canal
has
led
the
highways
of
commerce
back
to
the
nearer
east
the
democracy
and
nationalism
of
europe
have
been
extending
their
influence
over
asiatic
races
on
whatever
terms
the
war
is
concluded
one
result
is
certain
already
there
will
be
a
political
and
economic
revival
in
western
asia
and
the
direction
of
this
will
not
be
in
ottoman
hands
we
are
thus
witnessing
the
foundation
of
a
new
era
as
momentous
if
not
as
dramatic
as
alexander
passage
of
the
dardanelles
the
ottoman
vesture
has
waxed
old
and
something
can
be
discerned
of
the
new
forms
that
are
emerging
from
beneath
it
their
outstanding
features
are
worth
our
attention
ii
the
new
turkish
nationalism
is
the
immediate
factor
to
be
reckoned
with
it
is
very
new
newer
than
the
young
turks
and
sharply
opposed
to
the
original
young
turkish
programme
but
it
has
established
its
ascendancy
it
decided
turkey
entry
into
the
war
and
is
the
key
to
the
current
policy
of
the
ottoman
government
the
young
turks
were
not
nationalists
from
the
beginning
the
committee
of
union
and
progress
was
founded
in
good
faith
to
liberate
and
reconcile
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
empire
on
the
principles
of
the
french
revolution
at
the
committee
congress
in
the
nationalists
were
shouted
down
with
the
cry
our
goal
is
organisation
and
nothing
else
but
young
turkish
ideals
rapidly
narrowed
liberalism
gave
way
to
panislamism
panislamism
to
panturanianism
and
the
ottoman
state
idea
changed
from
liberty
equality
and
fraternity
to
the
turkification
of
nationalities
by
force
the
french
ideal
writes
the
nationalist
tekin
alp
in
on
the
nature
and
plan
of
a
greater
is
in
contradiction
to
the
needs
and
conditions
of
the
age
by
contrast
the
turkish
national
movement
does
not
exhibit
the
failings
of
the
earlier
movements
it
is
in
every
way
adapted
to
the
intellectual
standard
and
feelings
of
the
nation
it
also
keeps
pace
with
the
ideas
of
the
age
which
have
for
some
decades
centred
round
the
principle
of
nationality
in
adopting
turkish
nationalism
as
the
basis
of
their
national
policy
the
turks
have
only
abandoned
an
abnormal
state
of
affairs
and
thereby
placed
themselves
on
a
level
with
modern
nations
the
development
of
nationalism
among
the
turks
was
a
natural
phenomenon
starting
in
the
west
the
movement
has
been
spreading
for
a
century
through
central
europe
hungary
and
the
balkans
till
from
the
former
subjects
it
has
passed
to
the
turks
themselves
chance
played
its
part
nazim
bey
for
instance
the
general
secretary
of
the
union
and
progress
committee
is
said
to
have
been
fired
by
a
work
of
léon
cahun
on
the
early
history
of
the
turks
and
mongols
lent
him
by
the
french
at
salonika
and
the
movement
was
and
still
is
confined
to
a
small
but
that
is
the
case
with
other
national
movements
too
and
does
not
hinder
them
from
being
powerful
forces
turkish
nationalism
was
kept
alive
after
by
a
small
group
of
enthusiasts
at
salonika
their
leader
was
ziya
bey
who
had
come
up
to
the
young
turk
congress
from
diarbekir
and
was
one
of
the
first
converts
to
the
new
idea
it
gained
ground
suddenly
during
the
balkan
war
the
shock
of
defeat
produced
a
craving
for
regeneration
the
final
loss
of
europe
turned
the
minds
of
the
osmanlis
to
the
possibilities
of
asia
and
they
were
struck
by
the
action
of
several
prominent
russian
subjects
of
nationality
who
out
of
racial
sympathy
had
given
their
services
to
the
ottoman
government
in
this
time
of
adversity
as
tekin
alp
expresses
it
the
turks
realised
that
in
order
to
live
they
must
become
essentially
turkish
become
a
nation
be
themselves
the
turkish
nation
turned
aside
its
gaze
from
the
lost
territory
and
looked
instead
upon
turania
the
ideal
country
of
the
future
two
years
later
this
new
orientation
had
so
mastered
the
ottoman
government
that
it
drew
them
into
the
european
war
there
are
many
aims
within
the
new
turkish
horizon
some
of
them
are
negative
and
some
practical
and
extremely
aggressive
ziya
bey
adherents
first
took
in
hand
the
purification
of
the
turkish
language
a
turkish
poet
had
endeavoured
before
to
dispense
with
the
per
cent
of
the
vocabulary
that
was
borrowed
from
persian
and
arabic
and
his
poetry
had
to
be
published
in
small
provincial
papers
because
the
important
newspapers
of
the
towns
would
not
accept
it
the
established
writers
in
the
traditional
style
made
a
hard
fight
but
tekin
alp
claims
that
the
new
language
is
in
possession
of
an
absolute
and
unlimited
authority
borrowed
rhythms
have
been
banned
as
well
as
borrowed
words
and
there
is
even
an
agitation
to
replace
the
arabic
script
by
a
new
turkish
alphabet
an
imitation
of
the
albanian
movement
which
was
opposed
so
fiercely
by
the
turks
themselves
before
the
balkan
war
in
the
government
stepped
in
with
the
foundation
of
a
turkish
academy
bilgi
and
the
ministry
of
education
started
an
institute
of
terminology
conservatoire
and
writing
and
translation
committee
the
translation
of
foreign
masterpieces
as
an
incentive
to
a
new
national
literature
was
in
the
programme
of
ziya
bey
society
the
new
life
their
most
cherished
plan
was
to
translate
the
koran
and
the
friday
sermon
to
have
the
khutba
prayer
for
the
caliph
recited
in
turkish
and
to
remove
the
arabic
texts
from
the
walls
of
the
mosques
the
eyes
and
ears
of
turkish
moslems
were
to
be
saved
from
the
contamination
of
an
language
but
the
campaign
against
arabic
passed
over
into
an
attack
upon
islam
the
turkish
nationalists
tekin
alp
explains
have
made
great
efforts
to
nationalise
religion
itself
and
to
give
it
the
impress
of
the
turkish
national
spirit
this
idea
was
zealously
supported
by
a
fortnightly
periodical
and
one
of
the
noblest
tasks
undertaken
by
it
has
been
the
translation
of
the
koran
into
turkish
this
is
a
reform
of
the
greatest
importance
it
is
well
known
that
the
translation
of
the
koran
has
hitherto
been
considered
a
sin
the
nationalists
have
cut
themselves
off
from
this
superstitious
prejudice
and
have
had
three
translations
made
the
and
two
others
on
this
issue
the
nationalists
broke
a
lance
with
the
or
clericals
as
tekin
alp
prefers
to
call
them
because
it
is
written
in
the
koran
that
islam
knows
no
nationalities
but
only
believers
the
thought
that
to
occupy
oneself
with
national
questions
was
to
act
against
the
interests
and
principles
of
islam
itself
according
to
the
nationalists
the
pronouncement
in
the
koran
was
directed
exclusively
against
the
very
frequent
dissensions
of
clans
and
parties
in
the
various
arab
races
a
sneer
which
is
meant
to
have
a
modern
application
although
the
nationalists
proclaim
themselves
the
most
zealous
followers
of
mohammed
nevertheless
they
do
not
conceal
the
fact
that
their
interpretation
of
islam
is
not
the
same
as
that
of
the
arabs
they
maintain
that
the
turks
can
not
interpret
the
koran
in
the
same
manner
as
the
arabs
their
idea
of
god
is
also
different
this
amazing
is
quite
possibly
a
reminiscence
of
bismarckian
germany
for
turkish
nationalism
is
saturated
with
forgotten
european
moods
and
its
vein
of
romanticism
is
as
antiquated
as
the
kaiser
it
has
taken
attila
to
its
heart
and
rehabilitated
jenghis
khan
timur
oghuz
and
the
rest
with
the
erudition
of
a
turanian
walter
scott
my
attila
my
jenghis
sings
ziya
gök
alp
these
heroic
figures
which
stand
for
the
proud
fame
of
my
race
appear
on
the
dry
pages
of
the
history
books
as
covered
with
shame
and
disgrace
while
in
reality
they
are
no
less
than
alexander
and
caesar
still
better
known
to
my
heart
is
oghuz
khan
in
me
he
still
lives
in
all
his
fame
and
greatness
oghuz
khan
delights
and
inspires
my
heart
and
causes
me
to
sing
psalms
of
gladness
the
fatherland
of
the
turks
is
not
turkey
or
turkestan
but
the
broad
eternal
land
of
turania
the
ministry
of
religious
endowments
recently
made
a
grant
of
turkish
towards
the
publication
of
works
on
these
worthies
the
students
at
the
military
college
in
constantinople
are
alleged
to
have
been
diverted
from
their
studies
by
their
devotion
to
such
literature
and
on
the
eve
of
the
war
the
professor
of
military
education
there
is
reported
to
have
delivered
the
following
address
to
an
instruction
class
of
reserve
officers
we
are
gentlemen
before
all
turks
i
wonder
why
we
are
called
ottomans
for
who
is
osman
after
whom
we
are
named
he
is
a
turk
from
altai
who
overran
this
country
with
his
turkish
army
therefore
it
is
more
of
an
honour
to
us
to
be
named
after
his
origin
than
after
himself
we
have
so
far
been
deceived
by
the
ignorance
of
our
forebears
and
fie
on
these
forebears
who
made
us
forget
our
nationality
be
sure
that
turkish
nationality
is
better
for
us
than
islam
and
racial
pride
is
one
of
the
greatest
social
virtues
these
extravagances
must
not
be
taken
too
literally
the
young
turk
politicians
though
they
have
embarked
on
a
nationalist
policy
are
not
so
reckless
as
to
break
openly
with
islam
or
to
denounce
the
founder
of
their
state
they
see
clearly
enough
that
turkish
nationalism
carried
to
a
logical
extreme
is
incompatible
with
the
ottoman
pretension
and
they
favour
the
view
so
severely
criticised
by
tekin
alp
that
all
three
groups
of
ideas
ottomanism
islamism
and
the
turkish
movement
should
work
side
by
side
and
together
but
with
this
reservation
they
follow
the
doctrinaires
who
on
their
part
are
quite
ready
to
press
islam
into
their
service
tekin
alp
candidly
admits
that
they
sought
after
a
judicious
mingling
of
the
religious
and
national
impulses
they
realised
only
too
clearly
that
the
still
abstract
ideals
of
nationalism
could
not
be
expected
to
attract
the
masses
the
lower
classes
composed
of
uneducated
and
illiterate
people
it
was
found
more
expedient
to
reach
these
classes
under
the
flag
of
religion
this
sentence
reveals
in
a
flash
one
motive
of
the
armenian
deportations
which
followed
turkey
intervention
in
the
war
and
a
celebrated
german
authority
in
a
memorial
written
in
gives
this
very
explanation
of
their
origin
turkey
entry
into
the
war
he

was
unwelcome
to
turkish
society
in
constantinople
whose
sympathies
were
with
france
as
well
as
to
the
mass
of
the
people
but
the
panislamic
propaganda
and
the
military
dictatorship
were
able
to
stifle
all
opposition
the
proclamation
of
the
war
produced
a
general
agitation
of
the
mohammedan
against
the
christian
elements
in
the
empire
and
the
christian
nationalities
had
soon
good
reason
to
fear
that
turkish
chauvinism
would
make
use
of
mohammedan
fanaticism
to
make
the
war
popular
with
the
mass
of
the
mohammedan
population
the
evidence
presented
in
the
british
blue
book
on
the
of
armenians
in
the
ottoman
shows
that
this
explanation
is
correct
the
armenians
were
not
massacred
spontaneously
by
the
local
moslems
the
initiative
came
entirely
from
the
central
government
at
constantinople
which
planned
the
systematic
extermination
of
the
armenian
race
in
the
ottoman
empire
worked
out
a
uniform
method
of
procedure
despatched
simultaneous
orders
to
the
provincial
officials
and
gendarmerie
to
carry
it
into
effect
and
cashiered
the
few
who
declined
to
obey
the
armenians
were
rounded
up
and
deported
by
regular
troops
and
gendarmes
they
were
massacred
on
the
road
by
bands
of
consisting
chiefly
of
criminals
released
from
prison
by
the
government
for
this
work
when
the
armenians
were
gone
the
turkish
populace
was
encouraged
to
plunder
their
goods
and
houses
and
as
the
convoys
of
exiles
passed
through
the
villages
the
women
and
children
were
sold
cheap
or
even
given
away
for
nothing
to
the
turkish
peasantry
naturally
the
turkish
people
accepted
the
good
things
the
government
offered
them
and
naturally
this
reconciled
them
momentarily
to
the
war
thus
in
the
armenian
atrocities
the
young
turks
made
panislamism
and
turkish
nationalism
work
together
for
their
ends
but
the
development
of
their
policy
shows
the
islamic
element
receding
and
the
nationalist
gaining
ground
after
the
deposition
of
writes
the
german
authority
quoted
above
the
committee
of
union
and
progress
reverted
more
and
more
to
the
policy
to
begin
with
a
rigorous
party
tyranny
was
set
up
a
power
behind
the
government
got
the
official
executive
apparatus
into
its
hand
and
the
elections
to
parliament
ceased
to
be
free
the
appointment
of
the
highest
officials
in
the
empire
and
of
all
the
most
important
servants
of
the
administration
was
settled
by
decrees
of
the
committee
all
bills
had
to
be
debated
first
by
the
committee
and
to
receive
its
approval
before
they
came
before
the
chamber
public
policy
was
determined
by
two
main
considerations
the
centralistic
idea
which
claimed
for
the
turkish
race
not
merely
preponderant
but
exclusive
power
in
the
empire
was
to
be
carried
to
its
logical
consequences
the
empire
was
to
be
established
on
a
purely
islamic
foundation
turkish
nationalism
and
the
panislamic
idea
precluded
any
equality
of
treatment
for
the
various
races
and
religions
of
the
empire
and
any
movement
which
looked
for
the
salvation
of
the
empire
in
the
decentralisation
or
autonomy
of
its
various
parts
was
branded
as
high
treason
the
nationalistic
and
centralistic
tendency
was
directed
not
merely
against
the
various
nationalities
greeks
armenians
syrians
and
jews
but
also
against
the
mohammedan
nations
arabs
mohammedan
syrians
kurds
and
the
shia
element
in
the
population
an
idol
of
was
erected
and
all
elements
in
the
population
were
subjected
to
the
harshest
measures
the
rigorous
action
which
this
policy
prescribed
against
the
albanians
who
were
mostly
mohammedans
and
had
been
thorough
loyalists
till
then
led
to
the
loss
of
almost
the
whole
of
european
turkey
the
same
policy
has
provoked
insurrections
in
the
arab
half
of
the
empire
which
a
series
of
campaigns
has
failed
to
suppress
the
conflict
with
the
arab
element
continues
this
was
written
in
though
the
war
has
forced
it
to
a
certain
extent
into
the
background
the
conflict
with
the
arabs
that
has
been
the
worst
folly
of
the
young
turkish
politicians
and
it
will
perhaps
be
the
most
powerful
solvent
of
the
empire
which
the
osmanlis
have
misgoverned
so
long
it
is
the
inevitable
consequence
of
the
camarilla
government
and
the
chauvinism
for
which
the
committee
of
union
and
progress
has
come
to
stand
the
committee
consists
by
its
statutes
of
turks
alone
and
the
election
even
of
one
arab
was
vetoed
tekin
alp
informs
us
that
the
portfolio
of
the
minister
of
trade
and
agriculture
which
has
been
in
the
hands
of
greeks
and
armenians
since
the
time
of
the
constitution
and
was
lately
given
to
a
christian
arab
has
at
last
been
handed
over
to
the
constantinople
deputy
ahmed
nasimi
bey
who
joined
with
ziya
gök
alp
in
laying
the
foundations
of
the
turkish
movement
immediately
after
the
proclamation
of
the
constitution
with
one
exception
the
members
of
the
cabinet
are
all
imbued
with
the
same
ideas
and
principles
the
armenian
deportations
gave
the
committee
an
opportunity
of
tightening
its
hold
over
the
provincial
officials
as
well
valis
who
refused
to
carry
out
the
orders
were
superseded
if
they
were
enough
to
persist
but
more
often
they
were
browbeaten
by
the
leaders
of
the
local
young
turk
organisations
or
even
by
their
own
subordinates
and
let
things
go
their
way
ways
and
means
of
packing
the
administration
with
their
own
henchmen
had
been
discussed
by
the
committee
already
in
their
congress
of
october
and
they
had
defined
their
policy
then
in
the
following
remarkable
resolutions
the
formation
of
new
parties
in
the
chamber
or
in
the
country
must
be
suppressed
and
the
emergence
of
new
ideas
prevented
turkey
must
become
a
really
mohammedan
country
and
moslem
ideas
and
moslem
influence
must
be
preponderant
every
other
religious
propaganda
must
be
suppressed
the
existence
of
the
empire
depends
on
the
strength
of
the
young
turkish
party
and
the
suppression
of
all
antagonistic
ideas
sooner
or
later
the
complete
ottomanisation
of
all
turkish
subjects
must
be
effected
it
is
clear
however
that
this
can
never
be
attained
by
persuasion
but
that
we
must
resort
to
armed
force
the
character
of
the
empire
must
be
mohammedan
and
respect
must
be
secured
for
mohammedan
institutions
and
traditions
other
nationalities
must
be
denied
the
right
of
organisation
for
decentralisation
and
autonomy
are
treason
to
the
turkish
empire
nationalities
are
quantité
négligeable
can
keep
their
religion
but
not
their
language
the
propagation
of
the
turkish
language
is
one
of
the
sovereign
means
of
confirming
the
mohammedan
supremacy
and
assimilating
the
other
the
confusion
of
aims
in
these
two
paragraphs
reveals
the
direction
in
which
young
turkish
policy
has
been
travelling
religion
is
now
secondary
to
language
and
the
precedence
still
given
to
the
islamic
formula
is
only
in
apparent
contradiction
to
this
for
mohammedan
supremacy
is
equated
with
the
turkish
national
idea
such
a
version
of
panislamism
leaves
no
room
for
an
arab
race
under
ottoman
rule
and
the
panturanian
address
given
by
the
turkish
professor
at
the
military
college
in
constantinople
had
a
sequel
which
showed
the
arabs
what
they
too
had
to
expect
from
turkey
entrance
into
the
war
there
were
arabs
among
the
officers
whom
the
professor
was
addressing
and
one
of
them
ventured
to
protest
all
ottomans
are
not
turks
he
said
and
if
the
empire
were
to
be
considered
purely
turkish
then
all
the
elements
would
be
foreign
to
it
instead
of
being
living
members
of
the
political
body
known
as
the
ottoman
empire
fighting
the
common
fight
for
it
and
for
islam
to
this
the
professor
is
reported
to
have
replied
although
you
are
an
arab
yet
you
and
your
race
are
subject
to
turkey
have
not
the
turks
colonised
your
country
and
have
they
not
conquered
it
by
the
sword
the
ottoman
state
which
you
plead
is
nothing
but
a
social
trick
to
which
you
resort
in
order
to
attain
your
ends
as
to
religion
it
has
no
connexion
with
politics
we
shall
soon
march
forward
in
the
name
of
turkey
and
the
turkish
flag
casting
aside
religion
as
it
is
only
a
personal
and
secondary
question
you
and
your
nation
must
realise
that
you
are
turks
and
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
arab
nationality
and
an
arab
fatherland
it
is
said
that
the
arab
officers
present
handed
in
a
joint
protest
to
the
minister
of
war
asking
for
the
professor
dismissal
and
that
enver
bey
answer
was
to
have
them
all
sent
to
the
trenches
certainly
the
turkish
nationalists
have
not
concealed
their
attitude
towards
the
arabs
since
the
war
began
the
arab
lands
writes
djelal
noury
bey
in
a
work
and
above
all
irak
and
yemen
must
become
turkish
colonies
in
which
we
shall
spread
our
own
language
so
that
at
the
right
moment
we
may
make
it
the
language
of
religion
it
is
a
peculiarly
imperious
necessity
of
our
existence
for
us
to
turkise
the
arab
lands
for
the
particularistic
idea
of
nationality
is
awaking
among
the
younger
generation
of
arabs
and
already
threatens
us
with
a
great
catastrophe
against
this
we
must
be
forearmed
and
ahmed
sherif
bey
again
has
written
as
follows
in
the
the
arabs
speak
their
own
language
and
are
as
ignorant
of
turkish
as
if
their
country
were
not
a
dependency
of
turkey
it
is
the
business
of
the
to
make
them
forget
their
own
language
and
to
impose
upon
them
instead
that
of
the
nation
which
rules
them
if
the
porte
loses
sight
of
this
duty
it
will
be
digging
its
grave
with
its
own
hands
for
if
the
arabs
do
not
forget
their
language
their
history
and
their
customs
they
will
seek
to
restore
their
ancient
empire
on
the
ruins
of
ottomanism
and
of
turkish
rule
in
asia
a
turkish
pamphleteer
wrote
that
the
arabs
have
been
a
misfortune
to
turkey
and
that
a
turkish
conqueror
is
better
than
the
prophet
of
any
other
nation
this
pamphlet
was
distributed
in
the
caucasus
at
the
ottoman
government
expense
as
turkish
propaganda
but
the
best
proof
of
the
young
turks
intentions
towards
the
arabs
is
their
actual
conduct
in
the
arab
provinces
of
their
empire
in
the
spring
of
an
arab
who
had
escaped
from
syria
published
some
facts
in
the
egyptian
press
which
the
turkish
censorship
had
previously
managed
to
conceal
business
was
ruined
because
the
turks
had
confiscated
all
gold
and
forced
the
people
to
accept
depreciated
paper
the
population
was
starving
and
the
turks
had
prohibited
the
american
colony
at
beirűt
from
organising
relief
the
national
susceptibilities
of
the
inhabitants
were
outraged
in
petty
ways
the
railway
tickets
for
instance
were
no
longer
printed
in
arabic
but
only
in
turkish
and
german
and
spies
were
active
in
denouncing
the
least
manifestations
of
disaffection
a
turkish
was
sitting
in
the
lebanon
and
at
the
time
our
informant
left
syria
it
had
persons
under
arrest
of
them
on
political
charges
these
prisoners
were
the
leading
men
of
syria
christians
and
moslems
without
distinction
for
in
syria
as
in
armenia
the
turks
put
the
leaders
out
of
the
way
before
they
attacked
the
nation
as
a
whole
most
of
the
syrian
bishops
had
been
deported
or
driven
into
hiding
by
the
beginning
of
march
it
was
reckoned
that
arabs
in
syria
and
in
mesopotamia
had
already
been
condemned
to
death
with
the
confiscation
of
their
property
a
turkish
officer
taking
our
informant
for
a
turk
too
remarked
to
him
those
arabs
wish
to
get
rid
of
us
and
are
secretly
in
sympathy
with
our
enemies
but
we
mean
to
get
rid
of
them
ourselves
before
they
have
any
chance
of
translating
their
sympathy
into
action
this
caps
what
a
turkish
gendarme
in
armenia
said
to
a
danish
sister
serving
with
the
german
red
cross
first
we
kill
the
armenians
then
the
greeks
then
the
kurds
every
nationality
in
the
ottoman
empire
is
threatened
with
extermination
but
the
aims
of
turkish
nationalists
are
not
limited
by
the
ottoman
frontiers
if
they
are
resolved
to
clear
their
empire
of
every
element
that
is
only
a
step
towards
extending
it
over
everything
turkish
that
lies
outside
the
turks
have
not
only
aliens
to
get
rid
of
but
an
irredenta
to
win
the
ottoman
turks
tekin
alp
reminds
his
readers
now
only
represent
a
tenth
of
the
whole
turkish
nation
there
are
now
sixty
to
seventy
million
turkish
subjects
of
various
states
in
the
world
who
should
succeed
in
giving
the
nation
an
important
place
among
the
other
powers
unfortunately
there
is
no
connexion
between
the
separate
groups
which
are
distributed
over
great
tracts
of
land
their
aspirations
and
national
institutions
still
divide
them
now
that
the
ottoman
turks
have
awakened
from
their
sleep
of
centuries
they
do
not
only
think
of
themselves
but
hasten
to
save
the
other
parts
of
their
race
who
are
living
in
slavery
or
ignorance
turkish
irredentism
may
be
directed
towards
material
or
moral
reforms
according
to
circumstances
if
the
geographical
position
favours
the
venture
the
turks
can
free
their
brothers
from
foreign
rule
in
the
other
case
they
can
carry
it
on
on
moral
or
intellectual
lines
irredentism
which
other
nations
may
regard
as
a
luxury
though
often
a
very
terrible
and
costly
one
is
a
political
and
social
necessity
for
the
turks
if
all
the
turks
in
the
world
were
welded
into
one
huge
community
a
strong
nation
would
be
formed
worthy
to
take
an
important
place
among
the
other
nations
of
the
world
this
may
be
a
dream
but
the
young
turks
have
used
the
political
and
military
resources
of
the
ottoman
empire
to
make
it
a
reality
at
the
congress
of
it
was
resolved
that
immigration
from
the
caucasus
and
turkestan
must
be
promoted
land
found
for
the
immigrants
and
the
christians
hindered
from
acquiring
real
estate
turkey
was
first
to
be
reinforced
by
the
turks
abroad
in
the
european
war
she
was
to
strike
out
as
their
liberator
the
day
after
their
declaration
of
war
the
young
turkish
government
issued
a
proclamation
in
which
the
following
sentences
occur
our
participation
in
the
world
war
represents
the
vindication
of
our
national
ideal
the
ideal
of
our
nation
and
people
leads
us
towards
the
destruction
of
our
muscovite
enemy
in
order
to
obtain
thereby
a
natural
frontier
to
our
empire
which
should
include
and
unite
all
branches
of
our
race
when
war
broke
out
the
dashnaktzagan
the
armenian
parliamentary
party
in
the
ottoman
empire
were
in
congress
at
erzerum
a
deputation
of
young
turk
propagandists
presented
themselves
and
urged
the
armenians
to
join
them
in
raising
a
general
insurrection
in
caucasia
they
sketched
their
proposed
partition
of
russian
territory
the
tatars
were
to
have
this
the
georgians
that
the
armenians
this
other
autonomy
for
the
new
provinces
under
ottoman
suzerainty
was
to
be
the
reward
for
the
dasknaktzagan
had
always
worked
with
the
young
turks
in
internal
politics
but
they
refused
to
join
them
in
this
aggressive
venture
the
ottoman
armenians
they
said
would
do
their
duty
as
ottoman
subjects
during
the
war
but
they
advised
the
government
to
preserve
peace
if
that
were
still
possible
but
the
turks
were
past
reason
and
their
army
was
already
on
the
move
the
main
body
crossed
the
russian
frontier
a
second
force
invaded
northern
persia
and
penetrated
as
far
as
tabriz
tabriz
is
the
capital
of
azerbaijan
a
province
where
the
majority
of
the
population
is
turkish
by
language
and
beyond
across
the
river
aras
lies
the
russian
province
of
baku
also
containing
a
large
population
and
the
vital
oilfields
the
turkish
plan
of
campaign
was
frustrated
by
the
brilliant
russian
victory
of
sarikamysh
by
the
end
of
january
the
turkish
army
was
back
within
its
own
frontiers
and
in
this
quarter
it
has
not
again
advanced
beyond
them
but
the
young
turks
irredentist
ambitions
have
remained
in
being
during
their
brief
occupation
of
northern
persia
they
did
their
best
to
wipe
out
the
syriac
element
in
the
population
the
nestorian
christians
of
urmia
their
plan
was
to
get
rid
of
all
the
peoples
which
separate
the
turks
of
anatolia
from
the
turks
of
baku
and
azerbaijan
and
this
was
the
second
motive
of
the
armenian
deportations
which
they
put
in
hand
a
month
or
two
after
their
military
projects
had
failed
the
turkish
irredentists
propose
in
fact
to
gain
their
ends
by
bloodshed
and
terrorism
tekin
alp
like
most
turkish
publicists
and
politicians
since
is
a
macedonian
and
is
profoundly
impressed
by
the
methods
which
the
other
nationalities
there
employed
to
the
discomfiture
of
the
turks
themselves
observers
he
writes
who
like
myself
are
macedonians
and
like
myself
had
ample
opportunity
of
gaining
an
intimate
knowledge
of
the
irredentist
propaganda
of
the
bulgars
greeks
serbs
and
vlachs
are
able
to
judge
the
significance
of
this
striving
after
a
national
ideal
and
how
sweet
and
inspiring
it
is
to
go
through
the
greatest
dangers
for
such
a
cause
this
is
best
illustrated
by
a
few
living
examples
which
he
proceeds
to
give
macedonia
is
soaked
in
blood
atrocities
were
committed
here
the
mere
thought
of
which
makes
one
hair
stand
on
end
nevertheless
the
leaders
of
robber
bands
and
members
of
the
terrible
irredentist
organisations
were
not
regarded
by
the
public
as
wild
robbers
but
as
heroes
fighting
for
the
unity
of
the
nation
will
the
young
turks
emulate
the
of
these
men
russia
and
persia
are
the
fields
marked
out
for
such
activity
in
some
places
ordinary
propaganda
is
sufficient
but
in
territory
recourse
is
to
be
had
to
the
more
violent
measures
used
in
macedonia
the
neighbouring
land
of
persia
is
without
doubt
the
best
of
all
countries
with
turkish
population
for
spreading
the
new
ideas
and
it
has
been
found
that
simple
propaganda
is
amply
sufficient
to
produce
a
satisfactory
effect
on
this
fruitful
soil
in
persia
tekin
alp
reckons
of
the
population
is
of
turkish
blood
he
passes
these
turkish
elements
in
review
and
concludes
that
the
spirit
of
the
administration
is
turkish
and
also
the
leading
spirit
of
persian
civilisation
even
though
these
be
clothed
in
persian
guise
for
at
present
the
tables
are
turned
all
those
turkish
warriors
and
heroes
shahs
and
grand
viziers
thinkers
and
scholars
have
lost
their
turkish
consciousness
and
have
become
assimilated
to
the
persians
in
writing
speech
and
literature
even
the
compact
two
millions
and
a
half
of
azerbaijanis
will
write
letters
only
in
persian
and
will
not
read
a
turkish
newspaper
he
omits
the
most
important
fact
that
these
turks
of
persia
are
shias
like
their
persian
while
the
mohammedan
institutions
and
traditions
for
which
the
ottoman
turks
are
pledged
by
the
young
turk
party
to
secure
respect
are
those
of
the
sunni
persuasion
but
then
turkish
nationalism
depends
upon
ignoring
religion
tekin
alp
sets
out
confidently
to
give
the
turks
in
persia
a
turkish
soul
his
model
is
the
rumanian
propaganda
among
the
vlachs
in
macedonia
and
his
expectations
are
great
there
is
no
power
in
persia
to
put
down
such
a
movement
because
it
could
do
no
harm
to
anyone
the
nationalisation
of
the
persian
turks
would
even
be
a
great
and
unexpected
help
to
the
persian
government
persia
would
be
situated
with
regard
to
the
turkish
government
as
bavaria
towards
prussia
and
this
is
only
a
stage
towards
a
higher
goal
the
united
turks
should
form
the
centre
of
gravity
of
the
world
of
islam
the
arabs
of
egypt
morocco
and
tunisia
the
persians
afghans
must
enjoy
complete
independence
in
their
own
affairs
but
outwardly
the
world
of
islam
must
present
a
perfectly
united
front
the
arabs
of
north
africa
and
the
shias
of
iran
can
appraise
the
independence
held
out
to
them
by
the
unity
which
turkish
nationalism
has
been
presenting
already
to
syria
and
irak
the
yemen
and
the
hedjaz
but
tekin
alp
deals
even
less
tenderly
with
russia
in
explaining
the
bond
of
interest
between
turkish
nationalism
and
germany
he
remarks
that
the
aspirations
can
not
come
to
their
full
development
and
realisation
until
the
muscovite
monster
is
crushed
because
the
very
districts
which
are
the
object
of
turkish
irredentism
siberia
the
caucasus
the
crimea
afghanistan
are
still
directly
or
indirectly
under
russian
rule
the
et
cetera
proves
to
be
nothing
less
than
the
province
of
kazan
the
alluvial
plains
of
the
volga
and
the
kama
in
european
russia
are
inhabited
by
four
or
five
million
turks
the
northern
turks
are
not
indeed
superior
to
the
ottoman
turks
but
must
not
therefore
be
underrated
their
progressive
economic
and
social
organisation
is
in
every
way
a
great
help
to
the
national
movement
if
he
concludes
the
russian
despotism
is
as
we
hope
to
be
destroyed
by
the
brave
german
austrian
and
turkish
armies
thirty
to
forty
million
turks
will
receive
their
independence
with
the
ten
million
ottoman
turks
this
will
form
a
nation
of
fifty
million
advancing
towards
a
great
civilisation
which
may
perhaps
be
compared
to
that
of
germany
in
that
it
will
have
the
strength
and
energy
to
rise
ever
higher
in
some
ways
it
will
be
even
superior
to
the
degenerate
french
and
english
civilisations
this
nationalism
which
dominates
turkey
present
has
also
decided
the
question
of
her
future
if
such
a
movement
has
taken
possession
of
the
osmanlis
the
osmanlis
must
lose
possession
of
their
empire
turkish
nationalism
now
directs
the
ottoman
government
wields
its
pretensions
is
master
within
its
frontiers
and
how
does
it
use
its
mastery
to
make
a
hell
of
armenia
and
syria
and
to
plot
out
new
macedonias
in
persia
and
the
heart
of
russia
thus
turkish
nationalism
shows
where
the
turk
is
intolerable
and
must
go
but
it
also
shows
where
he
has
some
right
to
stay
there
are
innocent
and
constructive
elements
in
it
as
in
all
movements
of
the
kind
as
in
europe
it
has
forced
open
the
dead
hand
of
the
church
under
its
influence
the
ministry
of
which
holds
the
enormous
religious
endowments
of
turkey
in
trust
has
turned
its
funds
to
the
founding
of
a
national
bank
and
library
and
the
subsidising
of
a
national
architecture
it
has
also
started
elementary
schools
like
the
voluntary
schools
supported
by
the
christian
nationalities
in
aid
of
the
ministry
of
education
and
it
has
taken
up
the
reform
of
the
moslem
seminaries
which
have
been
one
of
the
strongholds
of
turkish
reaction
the
welfare
of
turkish
students
is
a
concern
of
the
nationalist
society
called
the
turkish
family
founded
in
and
now
possessing
sixteen
branches
in
various
provincial
towns
of
anatolia
only
turks
may
be
members
with
affiliated
societies
in
the
caucasus
and
turkestan
the
organises
lantern
lectures
lectures
on
mediaeval
anatolian
art
and
even
lectures
by
a
turkish
lady
on
panturanianism
and
woman
rights
she
is
said
to
have
had
khodjas
in
her
audience
and
if
so
this
certainly
shows
an
openness
to
new
ideas
on
the
part
of
the
islamji
another
society
the
turkish
strength
encourages
physical
culture
like
the
slavonic
and
there
are
or
turkish
under
enver
bey
patronage
who
take
turanian
blazon
the
white
wolf
of
turkish
paganism
on
their
flags
and
cheer
it
is
said
not
for
the
caliph
or
the
padishah
but
for
the
khakan
this
jumble
of
efforts
and
will
justify
turkish
nationalism
if
it
brings
about
the
regeneration
of
the
anatolian
peasantry
the
anatolians
have
suffered
as
much
from
the
ottoman
dominion
as
any
of
the
races
which
have
come
under
its
yoke
they
have
paid
for
ottoman
imperialism
with
their
blood
and
physique
their
villages
have
been
ravaged
by
the
syphilis
of
the
garrison
towns
and
the
wider
the
frontiers
of
the
empire
the
further
from
their
homes
the
anatolian
soldiers
have
died
in
the
yemen
in
albania
in
irak
on
the
armenian
plateau
two
things
are
necessary
for
salvation
the
limitation
of
the
turkish
state
to
the
lands
inhabited
by
its
population
and
the
replacement
of
the
mongrel
osmanli
bureaucracy
by
a
cleaner
and
more
democratic
political
order
if
the
allies
can
compass
this
they
may
claim
without
hypocrisy
to
have
liberated
another
nationality
for
anatolia
will
be
reborn
on
the
day
of
its
escape
from
the
ottoman
chrysalis
as
truly
as
were
serbia
and
greece
and
rumania
and
bulgaria
the
beginnings
will
be
difficult
as
they
have
been
in
the
balkans
whatever
frontiers
a
turkish
national
state
may
receive
they
can
not
be
drawn
without
including
elements
racial
geography
is
nowhere
very
simple
between
bagdad
and
vienna
and
in
view
of
what
the
turk
racial
minorities
have
suffered
during
the
war
and
before
it
those
left
to
him
hereafter
must
be
safeguarded
by
stringent
guarantees
far
more
stringent
than
the
capitulations
which
for
that
matter
protected
none
but
the
nationals
of
foreign
powers
the
capitulations
are
a
problem
in
themselves
they
were
repudiated
by
the
young
turkish
government
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
as
well
as
the
conventions
regulating
the
customs
tariff
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
the
peace
conference
can
pass
over
flagrant
violations
of
international
treaties
and
the
nationalists
contention
that
turkish
justice
has
been
brought
up
to
a
european
standard
will
not
bear
examination
on
the
contrary
the
young
turkish
congress
of
passed
a
resolution
that
the
reorganisation
of
the
administration
of
justice
was
less
important
than
the
abolition
of
the
capitulations
these
difficulties
however
might
be
settled
with
a
new
and
better
anatolian
government
and
as
for
the
racial
question
with
time
and
guaranteed
tolerance
for
religion
it
might
solve
itself
for
there
is
a
rude
vitality
in
the
turkish
language
and
the
greek
and
armenian
minorities
in
central
anatolia
have
been
gradually
adopting
it
in
place
of
their
native
speech
though
this
tendency
is
now
being
counteracted
by
the
spread
of
national
schools
among
the
scattered
outposts
of
the
two
nationalities
in
the
interior
iii
with
these
suggestions
anatolia
and
turkish
nationalism
may
be
dismissed
from
our
survey
shorn
of
their
pretensions
in
armenia
and
the
countries
south
of
taurus
the
turks
may
experiment
in
the
art
of
government
without
the
tragedies
which
their
present
domination
has
brought
upon
mankind
the
other
lands
and
peoples
of
western
asia
when
they
have
ceased
to
be
turkey
will
be
restored
once
more
to
the
civilised
world
what
forces
will
shape
their
growth
not
even
indirectly
the
discrowned
turk
for
if
he
were
not
banned
by
his
crimes
he
would
still
be
doomed
by
his
incapacity
the
relative
qualities
of
the
different
near
eastern
races
are
not
in
doubt
a
german
teacher
in
the
german
technical
school
at
aleppo
who
resigned
his
appointment
as
a
protest
against
the
armenian
atrocities
in
thus
records
his
personal
judgment
in
an
open
letter
to
the
the
young
turk
is
afraid
of
the
christian
nationalities
armenians
syrians
and
greeks
on
account
of
their
cultural
and
economic
superiority
and
he
sees
in
their
religion
a
hindrance
to
turkifying
them
by
peaceful
means
they
must
therefore
be
exterminated
or
converted
to
islam
by
force
the
turks
do
not
suspect
that
in
so
doing
they
are
sawing
off
the
branch
on
which
they
are
sitting
themselves
yet
who
is
to
help
turkey
forward
if
not
the
greeks
armenians
and
syrians
who
constitute
more
than
a
quarter
of
the
population
of
the
empire
the
turks
least
gifted
of
the
races
living
in
are
themselves
only
a
minority
of
the
population
and
are
still
far
behind
the
arabs
in
culture
where
is
there
any
turkish
trade
turkish
handicraft
turkish
industry
turkish
art
turkish
science
they
have
even
borrowed
their
law
and
religion
from
the
conquered
arabs
and
their
language
so
far
as
it
has
been
given
literary
form
we
teachers
who
have
been
teaching
greeks
armenians
arabs
turks
and
jews
in
german
schools
in
turkey
for
years
can
only
pass
judgment
that
of
all
our
pupils
the
pure
turks
are
the
most
unwilling
and
the
least
talented
when
for
once
in
a
way
a
turk
does
achieve
something
one
can
be
sure
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
that
one
is
dealing
with
a
circassian
an
albanian
or
a
turk
with
bulgarian
blood
in
his
veins
from
my
personal
experience
i
can
only
prophesy
that
the
turks
proper
will
never
achieve
anything
in
trade
industry
or
science
we
are
told
now
in
the
german
press
about
the
turks
hunger
for
education
and
of
how
they
are
thronging
eagerly
to
learn
german
there
is
even
a
report
of
language
courses
for
adults
which
have
been
started
in
turkey
they
have
certainly
been
started
but
with
what
result
one
reads
of
the
language
course
at
a
technical
school
which
began
with
twelve
turkish
teachers
as
pupils
our
informant
forgets
to
add
however
that
after
four
lessons
only
six
pupils
presented
themselves
after
five
five
after
six
four
and
after
seven
only
three
so
that
after
eight
lessons
the
course
broke
down
through
the
indolence
of
the
pupils
before
it
had
properly
commenced
if
the
pupils
had
been
armenians
they
would
have
persevered
till
the
end
of
the
school
year
learnt
industriously
and
finished
with
a
respectable
mastery
of
the
german
language
from
a
german
teacher
who
has
worked
in
turkey
for
three
years
this
verdict
is
crushing
and
tekin
alp
himself
virtually
admits
the
charge
it
is
true
he
writes
that
the
turkish
character
is
usually
lacking
in
the
qualities
most
essential
to
trade
or
economic
undertakings
but
these
may
be
acquired
by
a
reasonable
and
methodical
training
and
organisation
the
only
organisation
that
seems
to
occur
to
him
is
the
boycott
which
has
been
popular
with
the
turks
since
the
revolution
of
the
unaccommodating
attitude
of
the
greek
government
was
sufficient
excuse
he
remarks
in
reference
to
the
boycott
of
the
real
motive
however
was
the
longing
of
the
turkish
nation
for
independence
in
their
own
country
the
boycott
which
was
at
first
directed
solely
against
the
greeks
was
then
extended
to
the
armenians
and
other
circles
and
was
carried
out
with
undiminished
energy
this
movement
which
lasted
in
all
its
rigour
for
several
months
caused
the
ruin
of
hundreds
of
small
greek
and
armenian
tradesmen
the
systematic
and
rigorous
boycott
is
now
at
an
end
but
the
spirit
it
created
in
the
people
still
persists
it
can
now
be
asserted
that
the
movement
for
restoring
the
economic
life
of
turkey
is
on
the
right
road
the
real
effects
of
the
boycott
of
are
described
by
the
german
authority
whose
memorial
has
several
times
been
cited
in
this
article
he
tells
us
how
under
the
patronage
of
the
young
turkish
government
associations
were
formed
which
intimidated
the
moslem
peasants
into
buying
from
them
when
they
came
to
market
instead
of
from
the
christians
with
whom
they
had
formerly
dealt
the
peasants
came
to
their
old
dealers
the
memorial
continues
lamented
their
fate
and
asked
their
advice
as
to
how
they
could
save
themselves
from
the
hands
of
their
they
were
delighted
when
at
last
the
boycott
came
to
an
end
and
they
could
once
more
buy
from
greeks
and
armenians
where
they
were
well
served
and
got
good
value
for
their
money
if
the
turkish
nationalists
had
confined
themselves
to
economic
weapons
the
turks
economic
ineptitude
would
have
prevented
them
from
doing
serious
harm
but
by
abusing
the
political
and
military
powers
of
the
ottoman
state
to
perpetrate
the
recent
atrocities
they
have
struck
a
mortal
blow
at
the
prosperity
of
western
asia
in
the
whole
of
asia
minor
with
perhaps
one
or
two
exceptions
the
same
german
authority
states
there
is
not
a
single
pure
turkish
firm
engaged
in
foreign
trade
the
extermination
of
the
armenian
population
means
not
only
the
loss
of
from
to
per
cent
of
the
total
population
of
anatolia
but
what
is
most
serious
the
elimination
of
those
elements
in
the
population
which
are
the
most
highly
developed
economically
and
have
the
greatest
capacity
for
civilisation
and
this
is
the
universal
judgment
of
those
in
a
position
to
know
the
result
of
the
deportations
the
american
consul
at
aleppo
declares
in
an
official
report
is
that
as
per
cent
of
the
commerce
of
the
interior

bitterly

will
come
to
the
conclusion
that

call
it

what
not

in

it

particularly
in

rohrbach
the
german
specialist
on
the
near
east
forecasts
the
profits
of
the
bagdad
railway
from
the
results
of
russian
in
central
asia
he
prophesies
the
cultivation
of
cotton
in
the
regions
opened
up
by
the
line
on
a
scale
which
will
cover
an
appreciable
part
of
the
demands
of
german
industry
and
will
open
a
corresponding
market
for
german
wares
among
the
new
population
yet
the
decisive
factor
in
the
bagdad
railway
he
counsels
his
german
readers
is
not
to
be
found
in
these
economic
considerations
but
in
another
sphere
wiedenfeld
drives
this
home
germany
relation
to
turkey
his
monograph
begins
belies
the
doctrine
that
all
modern
understandings
and
differences
between
nations
have
an
economic
origin
we
are
certainly
interested
in
the
economic
advancement
of
turkey
but
in
setting
ourselves
to
make
turkey
strong
we
have
been
influenced
far
more
by
our
political
interests
as
a
state
among
states
politische
das
even
our
economic
activity
has
primarily
served
this
aim
and
has
in
fact
originated
to
a
large
extent
in
the
purely
problems
den
unmittelbaren
which
confronted
the
turkish
government
exclusively
economic
considerations
play
a
very
subordinate
part
in
relations
our
common
political
aims
and
germany
interest
in
keeping
open
the
to
the
indian
ocean
will
make
it
more
than
ever
imperative
for
us
to
strengthen
turkey
economically
with
all
our
might
and
to
put
her
in
a
position
to
build
up
on
independent
economic
foundations
a
body
politic
strong
enough
to
withstand
all
external
assaults
the
means
will
still
be
economic
the
goal
will
be
of
a
political
order
and
rohrbach
formulates
the
political
goal
with
startling
precision
after
twelve
pages
of
disquisition
on
recent
international
diplomacy
he
brings
his
thesis
to
this
point
the
bagdad
railway
links
up
with
the
railways
of
syria
and
the
importance
of
the
syrian
railway
system
lies
in
this
that
if
the
need
arose
it
would
be
the
direct
instrument
for
the
exercise
of
pressure
upon
england
supposing
that
became
necessary
in
the
direction
of
egypt
written
as
it
was
in
this
is
a
remarkable
anticipation
of
turkish
strategic
since
the
outbreak
of
war
but
it
is
infinitely
remote
in
purpose
from
the
economic
regeneration
of
western
asia
and
even
when
the
german
publicists
reckon
in
economic
values
they
generally
betray
their
political
design
the
special
point
for
germany
wiedenfeld
lays
down
in
discussing
the
agricultural
possibilities
of
the
ottoman
territories
is
that
to
a
large
extent
crops
can
be
grown
here
which
supplement
our
own
economic
resources
in
important
respects
in
peace
time
of
course
no
one
would
think
of
transporting
goods
of
such
bulk
as
agricultural
products
any
way
but
by
sea
but
the
war
has
impressed
on
us
with
brutal
clearness
the
value
for
us
of
being
able
on
occasions
of
extreme
necessity
to
import
cotton
from
turkey
by
land
thus
germany
economic
activity
in
turkey
has
been
not
for
prosperity
but
for
power
not
for
peace
but
for
war
in
developing
turkey
germany
is
simply
developing
the
central
europe
scheme
of
a
military
combine
economically
and
challenging
the
world
in
arms
germany
is
concerned
with
turkey
not
for
her
splendid
past
and
future
but
for
her
miserable
present
for
turkey
as
she
is
and
only
as
she
is
is
a
vital
chequer
on
the
where
germany
has
been
playing
her
game
of
world
power
or
des
interessens
as
wiedenfeld
would
say
therefore
germany
does
not
eye
the
lands
and
peoples
under
ottoman
dominion
with
a
view
to
their
common
advantage
and
her
own
she
selects
a
piece
among
them
which
she
can
keep
under
her
thumb
and
so
control
the
square
was
her
first
pawn
and
when
the
young
turk
party
swept
him
off
the
board
she
adopted
them
and
their
colour
for
by
hook
or
by
crook
through
this
agency
or
that
turkey
had
to
be
commanded
or
germany
play
was
spoilt
germany
control
over
turkey
depends
upon
the
maintenance
of
a
corrupt
minority
in
power
too
weak
and
corrupt
to
remain
in
it
without
germany
guarantee
and
corrupt
enough
when
secured
in
it
to
put
it
at
germany
disposal
a
free
hand
at
home
in
return
for
servitude
in
diplomacy
and
war
the
deal
is
called
hegemony
and
is
as
old
as
ancient
greece
by
her
hegemony
over
the
ottoman
government
germany
threatens
the
british
and
russian
empires
from
all
the
ottoman
frontiers
and
with
the
free
hand
that
is
their
price
the
young
turks
inflict
on
all
lands
and
peoples
within
those
frontiers
whatever
evils
conduce
to
the
maintenance
of
their
pretensions
as
rohrbach
and
wiedenfeld
point
out
this
political
understanding
underlies
all
germany
economic
efforts
in
western
asia
and
we
can
see
how
it
has
warped
them
from
their
proper
ends
the
track
of
the
bagdad
railway
for
example
has
not
been
selected
in
the
economic
interests
of
the
lands
and
peoples
which
it
ostensibly
serves
rohrbach
himself
admits
that
the
anatolian
section
of
the
bagdad
railway
can
not
be
described
as
properly
paying
its
way
it
is
otherwise
with
the
french
line
from
smyrna
to
afiun
kara
hissar
which
links
the
anatolian
railway
with
the
older
railway
system
in
the
west
the
parts
of
asia
minor
which
were
thickly
populated
and
prosperous
in
antiquity
lie
mostly
westward
of
this
first
section
of
the
bagdad
railway
round
the
and
french
and
english
railways
leading
down
to
the
aegean
there
are
other
parts
of
the
peninsula
he
continues
which
the
bagdad
railway
does
not
touch
at
all
the
vilayet
of
sivas
and
the
other
armenian
provinces
the
original
german
plan
was
to
carry
the
railway
through
armenia
from
angora
to
kharput
but
russia
not
unnaturally
vetoed
the
construction
so
near
her
caucasian
frontiers
of
a
line
which
by
the
nature
of
the
understanding
must
primarily
serve
strategic
ends
and
the
track
was
therefore
deflected
to
the
this
took
it
through
the
most
barren
parts
of
central
anatolia
and
in
the
next
section
involved
the
slow
and
costly
work
of
tunnelling
the
taurus
and
amanus
mountains
if
merely
economic
and
not
political
advantages
were
taken
into
account
rohrbach
concedes
the
question
might
perhaps
be
raised
whether
it
would
not
be
better
to
leave
the
anatolian
section
alone
altogether
and
begin
the
bagdad
railway
from
seleucia
on
the
syrian
coast
the
future
export
trade
in
grain
wool
and
cotton
will
in
any
case
do
all
it
can
to
lengthen
the
cheap
and
shorten
correspondingly
the
section
on
which
it
must
pay
railway
freights
the
fact
that
the
route
connecting
bagdad
with
the
mediterranean
coast
in
the
neighbourhood
of
antioch
is
the
oldest
greatest
and
still
most
promising
of
western
asia
is
independent
of
all
railway
projects
it
is
worth
remembering
that
a
railway
following
this
route
from
the
syrian
coast
to
the
persian
gulf
has
more
than
once
been
projected
by
the
british
government
as
early
as
the
thirties
of
last
century
colonel
chesney
was
sent
out
to
examine
the
ground
and
in
the
proposal
was
considered
by
a
committee
of
the
house
of
commons
for
the
economic
development
of
western
asia
it
is
clearly
a
better
plan
but
then
rohrbach
bases
the
necessity
for
the
east
anatolian
section
of
the
bagdad
railway
on
wholly
different
grounds
the
necessity
he
declares
consists
in
turkey
military
interests
which
obviously
would
be
very
poorly
served
by
german
railway
enterprise
if
troops
could
not
be
transported
by
train
without
a
break
from
bagdad
and
mosul
to
the
extremity
of
anatolia
and
the
bagdad
railway
is
thus
acknowledged
to
be
an
instrument
of
strategy
for
the
germans
and
for
the
turks
of
domination
for
means
that
turkish
troops
can
be
transported
at
a
moment
notice
through
the
tunnels
from
anatolia
to
enforce
the
ottoman
pretension
over
the
arab
lands
militarily
these
tunnels
are
the
most
valuable
section
of
the
line
economically
they
are
the
most
costly
and
unremunerative
and
the
second
and
longer
tunnel
could
still
have
been
dispensed
with
if
south
of
taurus
the
track
had
been
led
along
the
syrian
coast
economic
interests
and
considerations
of
expense
wiedenfeld
concedes
argued
strongly
for
the
latter
course
but
fortunately
as
we
must
admit
the
military
point
of
view
prevailed
thus
the
understanding
prevented
the
bagdad
railway
first
from
beginning
at
a
port
on
the
mediterranean
coast
and
then
from
touching
the
coast
at
all
the
spine
of
turkey
as
german
writers
are
fond
of
calling
it
distorts
the
natural
articulation
of
western
asia
nemesis
has
overtaken
the
germans
in
the
armenian
deportations
a
political
end
of
turkish
nationalism
which
swept
away
the
economic
means
towards
germany
subtler
policy
a
month
or
two
before
the
outbreak
of
war
rohrbach
stated
in
a
public
lecture
that
germany
has
an
important
interest
in
effecting
and
maintaining
contact
with
the
armenian
nation
we
have
set
before
ourselves
the
necessary
and
legitimate
aim
of
spreading
and
enrooting
german
influence
in
turkey
not
only
by
military
missions
and
the
construction
of
railways
but
also
by
the
establishment
of
intellectual
relations
by
the
work
of
german
in
a
word
by
moral
conquests
and
we
are
determined
by
pacific
means
to
reach
an
amicable
understanding
with
the
turks
and
the
other
nations
in
the
turkish
empire
our
ulterior
object
in
this
is
to
strengthen
the
turkish
empire
internally
with
the
aid
of
german
science
education
and
training
and
for
this
work
the
armenians
are
indispensable
a
few
months
later
germany
as
part
price
of
turkey
intervention
in
the
war
had
to
leave
the
young
turks
a
free
hand
to
exterminate
the
nation
which
was
the
indispensable
instrument
of
her
turkish
policy
on
the
august
the
german
ambassador
at
constantinople
handed
in
a
formal
protest
against
the
deportations
in
which
his
government
declined
all
responsibility
for
the
consequences
which
might
result
on
the
january
in
the
german
reichstag
the
chief
of
the
political
department
of
the
foreign
office
replied
to
a
question
from
liebknecht
that
an
exchange
of
views
about
the
reaction
of
these
measures
upon
the
population
was
taking
place
and
that
further
information
could
not
be
given
and
while
germany
was
maintaining
this
correct
attitude
before
the
world
she
was
assisting
in
turkey
at
the
destruction
of
her
own
work
even
the
atrocities
of
had
damaged
the
economic
prospects
of
the
adapa
district
from
which
rohrbach
hoped
so
much
for
the
first
thing
the
turkish
peasants
did
was
to
destroy
all
the
and
nearly
all
the
threshing
machines
there
were
over
a
hundred
of
them
which
the
armenian
villagers
had
imported
for
the
cultivation
of
the
civilian
plain
by
the
atrocities
of
the
economic
life
of
western
asia
was
completely
ruined
and
the
fruits
of
german
enterprise
were
swept
away
in
the
flood
i
have
before

writes
our
german
memorialised
a
list
of
the

of

its

in

this

has
outstanding
amount
to
date
to

owing
from
customers
in
towns
of
the

in
consequence
of
the
armenian
deportations
these
debts
are
no
longer
recoverable
the
customers
with
all
their

have
vanished
from

to
the
german
orphanage
there
was
a
carpet
factory
with
dyeing
vats
and
a
spinnery
which
rohrbach
after
personal
investigation
describes
as
an
institution
to
be
welcomed
as
unreservedly
from
the
national
as
from
the
humanitarian
point
of
view
the
factory
he
remarks
not
only
provides
work
and

for
persons
but
has
transplanted
one
of
the
most
profitable
and
promising
industries
of
the
east
into
the
sphere
traversed
by
the
german
railway
where
german
interests
are
predominant
he
prophesies
that

of
western

from
which
english

other
foreign

evil
apparently

germany
good
but
in
rohrbach
did
not
foresee
the
catastrophe
of
for
the
rise
of
the

our
german
memorialised
writes
turkey

it
points
the
irony
of
the
situation
that
the
turkish

were
served
by
german
artillerymen
i
have
nothing
to
say
writes
niepage
the
german
teacher
from
aleppo
about
the
opinion
of
the
german
officers
in
turkey
i
often
noticed
among
them
an
ominous
silence
or
a
convulsive
effort
to
change
the
subject
when
any
german
of
warm
feelings
and
independent
judgment
talked
in
their
presence
of
the
fearful
sufferings
of
the
armenians
this
moral
bankruptcy
is
more
fatal

the
future
of

asia
than
all
the
material
havoc
which
the
armenian
deportations
have
caused
for
niepage
is
convinced
that
the
blood
of
the
armenians
will
be
on
germany
head
teaching
of
the
germans
is
the
simple
turk
explanation
and
more
sensitive
mohammedans
turks
and
arabs
alike
can
not
believe
that
their
own
government
has
ordered
these
horrors
they
lay
all
excesses
at
the
germans
door
for
the
germans
during
the
war
are
regarded
as
turkey
schoolmasters
in
everything
the
mollahs
declare
in
the
mosques
that
the
german
officers
and
not
the
sublime
porte
have
ordered
the
maltreatment
and
extermination
of
the
armenians
others
say
the
german
government
has
its
hands
tied
by
certain
agreements
defining
its
powers
or
perhaps
it
is
not
an
opportune
moment
for
intervention
our
presence
had
no
ameliorating
effect
and
what
we
could
do
ourselves
was
negligible
the
abusive
epithet
is
heard
once
more
by
german
ears
we
think
it
our
duty
to
draw
attention
to
the
fact
that
our
educational
work
in
turkey
forfeits
its
moral
basis
and
the
natives
esteem
if
the
german
government
is
not
in
a
position
to
prevent
the
brutalities
inflicted
here
upon
the
wives
and
children
of
murdered
armenians
the
writer
considers
it
out
of
the
question
that
the
german
government
if
it
seriously
desired
to
stem
the
tide
of
destruction
in
this
eleventh
hour
would
find
it
impossible
to
bring
the
turkish
government
to
reason
if
we
persist
in
treating
the
massacres
of
christians
as
an
internal
affair
of
turkey
which
is
only
important
to
us
because
it
ensures
us
the
turks
friendship
then
we
must
change
the
orientation
of
our
german
we
must
stop
sending
german
teachers
to
turkey
and
we
teachers
must
give
up
telling
our
pupils
in
turkey
about
german
poets
and
philosophers
german
culture
and
german
ideals
to
say
nothing
of
german
christianity
three
years
ago
i
was
sent
by
the
foreign
office
as
teacher
to
the
german
technical
school
at
aleppo
the
prussian
provincial
school
board
at
magdeburg
specially
enjoined
upon
me
when
i
went
out
to
show
myself
worthy
of
the
confidence
reposed
in
me
in
the
grant
of
furlough
to
take
up
this
post
i
should
not
be
fulfilling
my
duty
as
a
german
official
and
an
accredited
representative
of
german
culture
if
i
consented
to
keep
silence
in
face
of
the
atrocities
of
which
i
was
a
witness
or
to
look
on
passively
while
the
pupils
entrusted
to
my
charge
were
driven
out
into
the
desert
to
die
of
starvation
the
things
of
which
everybody
here
has
been
a
witness
for
months
past
remain
as
a
stain
on
germany
shield
in
the
minds
of
oriental
nations
what
will
be
left
to
germany
in
western
asia
after
the
war
she
may
keep
her
trade
though
wiedenfeld
confesses
that
the
exchange
of
commodities
between
germany
and
turkey
has
never
attained
any
really
considerable
dimensions
and
that
the
german
export
trade
commands
no
really
staple
article
whatever
of
the
kind
exported
by
england
austria
and
russia
unless
we
count
as
such
munitions
and
other
materials
of
war
except
for
the
last
item
this
german
trade
will
probably
remain
and
grow
but
the
german
hegemony
based
on
railway
enterprise
and
reinsured
by
moral
conquests
will
scarcely
survive
the
ottoman
dominion
happily
there
are
other
representatives
of
culture
other
indigenous
nationalities
other
possibilities
of
economic
development
which
will
remain
in
western
asia
when
the
turk
and
german
have
gone
and
which
may
be
equal
to
repairing
the
ruin
they
will
leave
behind
for
nearly
a
century
now
the
american
evangelical
missions
have
been
doing
work
there
which
is
the
greatest
conceivable
contrast
to
the
german
of
the
last
thirty
years
a
missionary
sent
out
to
relieve
the
first
pioneers
was
given
the
following
instructions
by
the
american
board
the
object
of
our
missions
to
the
oriental
churches
is
first
to
revive
the
knowledge
and
spirit
of
the
gospel
among
them
and
secondly
by
this
means
to
operate
upon
the
mohammedans
the
oriental
churches
need
assistance
from
their
brethren
abroad
our
object
is
not
to
subvert
them
you
are
not
sent
among
those
churches
to
proselytise
let
the
armenian
remain
an
armenian
if
he
will
the
greek
a
greek
the
nestorian
a
nestorian
the
oriental
an
oriental
your
great
business
is
with
the
fundamental
doctrines
and
duties
of
the
gospel
in
this
spirit
the
american
missionaries
have
worked
they
have
had
no
warships
behind
them
no
diplomatic
support
no
political
ambitions
no
economic
concessions
as
evangelicals
their
first
step
was
to
translate
the
bible
into
all
the
living
languages
and
current
scripts
of
the
nearer
east
for
the
bulgars
and
armenians
this
was
the
beginning
of
their
modern
literature
but
the
jealousy
of
the
orthodox
and
gregorian
clergy
was
naturally
aroused
native
protestant
churches
formed
themselves
not
by
the
missionaries
initiative
but
on
their
own
they
were
trained
by
the
missionaries
to
and
as
they
spread
from
centre
to
centre
they
grouped
themselves
in
unions
with
annual
meetings
to
settle
their
common
affairs
the
missionaries
also
encouraged
them
to
be
and
in
the
contributions
of
the
native
churches
to
the
general
expenses
of
the
missions
were
twice
as
large
as
those
of
the
american
board
the
ottoman
government
recognised
its
protestant
subjects
as
a
religious
corporation
millet
in
and
in
spite
of
this
the
jealousy
of
the
national
churches
was
overcome
for
the
work
of
the
americans
was
not
confined
to
the
new
protestant
community
the
translation
of
the
bible
led
them
also
into
educational
work
they
laid
the
foundations
of
secondary
education
in
western
asia
and
their
schools
and
colleges
still
the
only
institutions
of
their
kind
are
attended
by
gregorians
as
well
as
protestants
moslems
as
well
as
christians
moslem
girls
as
well
as
boys
as
they
opened
up
remoter
districts
they
added
medicine
to
their
activities
and
their
hospitals
like
their
schools
have
been
the
first
in
the
field
and
all
this
has
been
built
up
so
unassumingly
that
its
magnitude
is
hardly
realised
by
the
americans
themselves
in
the
three
turkey
missions
which
cover
anatolia
and
armenia
the
whole
of
turkey
except
the
arab
lands
there
were
on
the
eve
of
the
war
american
missionaries
with
native
helpers
protestant
churches
with
members
schools
with
pupils
constantinople
college
and
other
colleges
or
high
schools
for
girls
robert
college
on
the
bosphorus
and
other
colleges
for
men
or
boys
and
hospitals
the
war
when
it
came
seemed
to
sweep
away
everything
the
protestant
armenians
in
spite
of
a
nominal
exemption
were
deported
and
massacred
like
their
gregorian
the
boys
and
girls
were
carried
away
from
the
american
colleges
the
nurses
and
patients
from
the
hospitals
the
empty
buildings
were
requisitioned
by
the
ottoman
authorities
the
missionaries
themselves
in
their
devoted
efforts
to
save
a
remnant
from
destruction
suffered
as
many
casualties
from
typhus
and
physical
exhaustion
as
any
proportionate
body
of
workers
on
the
european
battlefields
the
turkish
nationalists
congratulated
themselves
that
the
american
work
in
western
asia
was
destroyed
in
praising
a
lecture
by
a
member
of
the
german
who
had
declared
himself
opposed
to
all
missionary
activities
in
the
turkish
empire
a
constantinople
newspaper
wrote
the
suppression
of
the
schools
founded
and
directed
by
ecclesiastical
missions
or
by
individuals
belonging
to
enemy
nations
is
as
important
a
measure
as
the
abolition
of
the
capitulations
thanks
to
their
schools
foreigners
were
able
to
exercise
great
moral
influence
over
the
young
men
of
the
country
and
they
were
virtually
in
charge
of
its
spiritual
and
intellectual
guidance
by
closing
them
the
government
has
put
an
end
to
a
situation
as
humiliating
as
it
was
dangerous
but
the
missionaries
spirit
was
something
they
could
not
destroy
when
they
deported
the
armenians
wrote
a
missionary
and
left
us
without
work
and
without
friends
we
decided
to
come
home
and
get
our
vacation
and
be
ready
to
go
wherever
we
could
after
the
war
after
the
war
the
turks
in
anatolia
may
still
be
infatuated
enough
to
banish
their
best
friends
but
in
armenia
when
the
turk
has
gone
the
americans
will
find
more
than
their
former
field
for
in
one
form
or
another
armenia
is
certain
to
rise
again
the
turks
have
not
succeeded
in
exterminating
the
armenian
nation
half
of
it
lives
in
russia
and
its
colonies
are
scattered
over
the
world
from
california
to
singapore
even
within
the
ottoman
frontiers
the
extermination
is
not
complete
and
the
arabian
deserts
will
yield
up
their
living
as
well
as
the
memory
of
their
dead
the
relations
of
armenia
with
the
russian
democracy
should
not
be
more
difficult
to
settle
than
those
of
finland
and
poland
her
frontiers
can
not
be
forecast
but
they
must
include
the
six
vilayets
so
often
promised
reforms
by
the
concert
of
europe
and
so
often
abandoned
to
the
revenges
of
the
ottoman
government
as
well
as
the
civilian
highlands
and
some
outlet
to
the
sea
one
thing
is
certain
that
whatever
land
is
restored
to
them
the
armenians
will
turn
its
resources
to
good
account
for
while
their
are
the
merchants
and
artisans
of
western
asia
per
of
them
are
tillers
of
the
soil
what
the
americans
have
done
for
armenia
has
been
done
for
syria
by
the
french
there
are
half
a
million
maronite
catholics
in
syria
and
since
the
seventeenth
century
france
has
been
the
protectress
of
catholicism
in
the
near
east
in
when
there
was
trouble
in
syria
and
the
maronites
were
being
molested
by
the
ottoman
government
france
landed
an
army
corps
and
secured
autonomy
for
the
lebanon
under
a
christian
governor
but
french
influence
is
not
limited
to
the
lebanon
province
all
over
syria
there
are
french
clerical
secular
and
judaic
schools
beirűt
and
damascus
christian
and
moslem
for
there
is
more
religious
tolerance
in
syria
than
in
most
near
eastern
countries
are
equally
under
the
spell
of
french
civilisation
and
france
is
the
chief
economic
power
in
the
land
for
french
enterprise
has
built
the
syrian
railways
the
sufferings
of
syria
during
the
war
have
been
described
the
young
turks
have
confiscated
the
railways
and
deprived
the
lebanon
of
its
autonomy
even
rohrbach
deprecates
the
fact
that
only
a
few
of
the
higher
officials
in
syria
are
chosen
from
among
the
natives
of
the
country
while
almost
all
from
the
kaimakam
upwards
are
sent
out
from
constantinople
and
he
attributes
to
this
policy
the
feeling
against
the
turks
which
is
most
acute
in
damascus
this
is
periphrasis
for
arab
nationalism
which
will
be
master
in
its
own
house
when
the
turk
has
been
removed
the
future
status
and
boundaries
of
syria
can
no
more
be
forecast
than
those
of
armenia
at
the
present
stage
of
the
war
yet
here
too
certain
tendencies
are
clear
in
some
form
or
other
arab
syria
will
retain
her
connection
with
france
and
her
growing
population
will
no
longer
be
driven
by
misgovernment
to
emigration
syrians
and
armenians
have
been
emigrating
for
the
last
quarter
of
a
century
and
during
the
same
period
the
jews
whose
birthright
in
western
asia
is
as
ancient
as
theirs
have
been
returning
to
their
native
land
not
because
ottoman
dominion
bore
less
hardly
upon
them
than
upon
other
gifted
races
but
because
nothing
could
well
be
worse
than
the
conditions
they
left
behind
for
these
jewish
immigrants
came
almost
entirely
from
the
russian
pale
the
hearth
and
hell
of
modern
jewry
the
movement
really
began
after
the
assassination
of
alexander
ii
in
which
threw
back
reform
in
russia
for
years
the
jews
were
the
scapegoats
of
the
reaction
new
laws
deprived
them
of
their
last
civil
rights
of
life
itself
they
came
to
palestine
as
refugees
and
between
and
their
numbers
there
increased
from
to
souls
the
most
remarkable
result
of
this
movement
has
been
the
foundation
of
flourishing
agricultural
colonies
their
struggle
for
existence
has
been
hard
the
pioneers
were
students
or
of
the
ghetto
unused
to
outdoor
life
and
ignorant
of
near
eastern
conditions
baron
edmund
de
rothschild
financed
them
from
to
at
a
loss
then
they
were
taken
over
by
the
palestine
colonisation
association
which
discovered
the
secrets
of
success
in
and
scientific
methods
each
colony
is
now
governed
by
an
elective
council
of
inhabitants
with
committees
for
education
police
and
the
arbitration
of
disputes
and
they
have
organised
unions
which
make
them
independent
of
middlemen
in
the
disposal
of
their
produce
their
production
has
rapidly
risen
in
quantity
and
value
through
the
industry
and
intelligence
of
the
average
jewish
settler
assisted
latterly
by
an
agricultural
experiment
station
at
atlit
near
haifa
which
improves
the
varieties
of
indigenous
crops
and
acclimatises
others
there
is
a
palestine
land
development
company
which
buys
land
in
big
estates
and
resells
it
in
small
lots
to
individual
settlers
and
an
bank
which
makes
advances
to
the
new
settlers
when
they
take
up
their
holdings
as
a
result
of
this
enlightened
policy
the
number
of
colonies
has
risen
to
about
forty
with
inhabitants
in
all
and
acres
of
land
and
these
figures
do
not
do
full
justice
to
the
importance
of
the
colonising
movement
the
jewish
agriculturists
are
only
per
cent
of
the
jewish
population
in
palestine
and
per
of
the
total
population
of
the
country
but
they
are
the
most
active
intelligent
element
and
the
only
element
which
is
rapidly
increasing
again
the
land
they
own
is
only
per
cent
of
the
total
area
of
palestine
but
it
is
between
and
per
cent
of
the
area
under
cultivation
and
there
are
vast
uncultivated
tracts
which
the
jews
can
and
will
reclaim
as
their
numbers
grow
both
by
further
colonisation
and
by
natural
increase
for
the
first
generation
of
colonists
have
already
proved
their
ability
to
multiply
in
the
promised
land
under
this
new
jewish
husbandry
palestine
has
begun
to
recover
its
ancient
prosperity
the
jews
have
sunk
artesian
wells
built
dams
for
water
storage
fought
down
malaria
by
drainage
and
eucalyptus
planting
and
laid
out
many
miles
of
roads
in
an
acre
of
irrigable
land
at
the
earliest
colony
was
worth
in
and
the
annual
trade
of
jaffa
rose
from
to
between
and
the
impetus
to
agriculture
is
benefiting
the
whole
economic
life
of
the
country
wrote
the
german
at
jaffa
in
his
report
for
and
there
is
no
fear
that
as
immigration
increases
the
arab
element
will
be
crowded
to
the
wall
there
are
still
only
two
jewish
colonies
beyond
jordan
where
the
hauran
under
the
roman
empire
a
with
a
dozen
cities
has
been
opened
up
by
the
railway
and
is
waiting
again
for
the
plough
but
will
immigration
continue
now
that
the
jew
of
the
pale
has
been
turned
at
a
stroke
into
the
free
citizen
of
a
democratic
country
probably
it
will
actually
increase
for
the
pale
has
been
ravaged
as
well
as
liberated
during
the
war
and
the
jews
of
germany
have
based
an
ingenious
policy
on
this
prospect
which
is
expounded
thus
by
of
berlin
according
to
the
most
recent
statistics
about
out
of
the
jews
in
the
world
speak
german
or
yiddish
as
their
but
its
language
cultural
orientation
and
business
relations
the
jewish
element
from
eastern
europe
the
pale
is
an
asset
to
german
influence
in
a
certain
sense
the
jews
are
a
near
eastern
element
in
germany
and
a
german
element
in
turkey
germany
may
not
relish
her
kinship
with
these
lost
teutonic
tribes
but
makes
a
satirical
exposure
of
such
scruples
it
used
to
be
a
stock
argument
against
the
jews
that
regarded
them
with
equal
hostility
but
the
war
has
brought
upon
the
germans
such
a
superabundance
of
almost
universal
execration
that
the
question
which
is
the
most
despised
of
all
nations
if
one
goes
not
by
justice
and
equity
but
by
the
violence
and
extensiveness
of
the
prejudice
might
well
now
be
altered
to
the
germans
disadvantage
in
this
unenviable
competition
for
the
prize
of
hate
turkey
too
has
a
word
to
say
for
the
unspeakable
turk
is
a
rhetorical
commonplace
of
english
politics
having
thus
isolated
the
jews
from
humanity
and
pilloried
them
with
the
german
and
the
turk
the
writer
expounds
their
function
in
the
system
hitherto
germany
has
bothered
herself
very
little
about
the
jewish
emigration
from
eastern
europe
people
in
germany
hardly
realised
that
through
the
annual
exodus
of
about
jews
to
the
united
states
and
england
the
empire
of
the
english
language
and
the
economic
system
that
goes
with
it
is
being
enlarged
while
a
german
asset
is
being
proportionately
depreciated
the
war
found
the
jewry
of
eastern
europe
in
process
of
being
uprooted
and
has
enormously
accelerated
the
catastrophe
galicia
and
the
western
provinces
of
russia
which
between
them
contain
many
more
than
half
the
jews
in
the
world
have
suffered
more
from
the
war
than
any
other
region
jewish
homes
have
been
broken
up
by
hundreds
of
thousands
and
there
is
no
doubt
whatever
that
as
a
result
of
the
war
there
will
be
an
emigration
of
east
european
jews
on
an
unprecedented
scale
the
disposal
of
the
east
european
jews
will
be
a
problem
for
germany
it
will
no
longer
do
simply
to
close
the
german
frontiers
to
them
and
in
view
of
the
difficulties
which
would
result
from
a
wholesale
migration
of
eastern
jews
into
germany
itself
germans
will
only
be
too
glad
to
find
a
way
out
in
the
emigration
of
these
jews
to
turkey
a
solution
extraordinarily
favourable
to
the
interests
of
all
three
parties
concerned
and
from
this
he
passes
to
a
wider
vision
the
jews
abroad
are
a
kind
of
province
which
is
well
worth
cultivation
of
the
jewish
world
speak
german
and
a
good
part
of
the
remainder
live
in
the
islamic
world
which
is
germany
friend
so
that
there
are
grounds
for
talking
of
a
german
protectorate
over
the
whole
of
jewry
by
this
exploitation
of
aversions
trietsch
expects
to
deposit
the
jews
of
the
pale
over
western
asia
as
for
a
german
harvest
and
if
the
jewish
migration
to
palestine
had
remained
nothing
more
than
a
stream
of
refugees
he
might
possibly
have
succeeded
in
his
purpose
but
in
the
last
twenty
years
this
jewish
movement
has
become
a
positive
thing
no
longer
a
flight
from
the
pale
but
a
remembrance
of
zion
and
zionism
has
already
challenged
and
defeated
the
policy
which
trietsch
represents
the
object
of
zionism
it
was
announced
in
the
drawn
up
by
the
first
zionist
congress
in
is
to
establish
for
the
jewish
people
a
publicly
and
legally
assured
home
in
palestine
for
the
zionists
jewry
is
a
nation
and
to
become
like
other
nations
it
needs
its
motherland
in
the
jewish
colonies
in
palestine
they
see
not
merely
a
successful
social
enterprise
but
the
visible
symbol
of
a
body
politic
the
foundation
of
a
national
university
in
jerusalem
is
as
ultimate
a
goal
for
them
as
the
economic
development
of
the
land
and
their
greatest
achievement
has
been
the
revival
of
hebrew
as
the
living
language
of
the
palestinian
jews
it
was
this
that
brought
them
into
conflict
with
the
germanising
tendency
in
a
secondary
school
was
successfully
started
at
jaffa
by
the
initiative
of
jewish
teachers
in
palestine
with
hebrew
as
the
language
of
instruction
but
in
when
a
jewish
polytechnic
was
founded
at
haifa
the
which
had
taken
a
leading
part
refused
to
follow
this
precedent
and
insisted
on
certain
subjects
being
taught
in
german
not
only
in
the
polytechnic
but
in
the
other
schools
the
result
was
a
secession
of
pupils
and
teachers
purely
hebrew
schools
were
opened
the
zionist
organisation
gave
official
support
and
the
germanising
party
was
compelled
to
accept
a
compromise
which
was
in
effect
a
victory
for
the
hebrew
language
trietsch
himself
accepts
this
settlement
but
does
not
abandon
his
idea
it
was
certainly
impossible
to
expect
the
spanish
and
jews
to
submit
in
their
own
jewish
country
to
the
hegemony
of
the
german
language
only
hebrew
could
become
the
common
vernacular
language
of
the
scattered
fragments
of
jewry
drifting
back
to
palestine
from
all
the
countries
of
the
world
but
in
addition
to
hebrew
to
which
they
are
more
and
more
inclined
the
jews
must
have
a
weltsprache
and
this
can
only
be
german
anyone
acquainted
with
the
of
central
europe
will
feel
that
this
suggestion
veils
a
threat
what
has
been
happening
in
palestine
during
the
war
trietsch
informs
us
that
the
ottoman
government
has
been
proceeding
with
the
naturalisation
of
the
palestinian
jews
and
that
the
local
execution
of
this
measure
has
not
been
effected
without
disturbances
which
are
beyond
the
province
of
this
pamphlet
one
significant
consequence
was
the
appearance
in
egypt
of
palestinian
refugees
who
raised
a
zion
mule
corps
there
and
fought
through
the
gallipoli
campaign
what
is
the
outlook
for
palestine
after
the
war
if
the
ottoman
pretension
survives
the
menace
from
turkish
nationalism
and
german
resentment
is
grave
but
if
turk
and
german
go
there
are
zionists
who
would
like
to
see
palestine
a
british
protectorate
with
the
prospect
of
growing
into
a
british
dominion
certainly
if
the
jewish
colonies
are
to
make
progress
they
must
be
relieved
of
keeping
their
own
police
building
their
own
roads
and
the
other
burdens
that
fall
on
them
under
ottoman
government
and
this
can
only
be
secured
by
a
better
public
administration
as
for
the
british
side
of
the
question
we
may
consult
trietsch
there
are
possibilities
he
urges
in
a
german
protectorate
over
the
jews
as
well
as
over
islam
smaller
national
units
than
the
million
jews
have
been
able
to
do
germany
vital
injury
or
service
and
while
the
jews
have
no
national
state
their
dispersion
over
the
whole
world
their
high
standard
of
culture
and
their
peculiar
abilities
lend
them
a
weight
that
is
worth
more
in
the
balance
than
many
larger
national
masses
which
occupy
a
compact
area
of
their
own
other
powers
than
germany
may
take
these
possibilities
to
heart
here
then
are
peoples
risen
from
the
past
to
do
what
the
turks
can
not
and
the
germans
will
not
in
western
asia
there
is
much
to
be
done
reform
of
justice
to
obtain
legal
release
from
the
capitulations
reform
in
the
assessment
and
collection
of
the
agricultural
tithes
which
have
been
denounced
for
a
century
by
every
student
of
ottoman
administration
agrarian
reform
to
save
peasant
proprietorship
which
in
syria
at
any
rate
is
seriously
in
danger
genuine
development
of
economic
resources
unsectarian
and
advancement
of
education
but
the
jews
syrians
and
armenians
are
equal
to
their
task
and
with
the
aid
of
the
foreign
nations
on
whom
they
can
count
they
will
certainly
accomplish
it
the
future
of
palestine
syria
and
armenia
is
thus
assured
but
there
are
other
countries
once
as
fertile
prosperous
and
populous
as
they
which
have
lost
not
only
their
wealth
but
their
inhabitants
under
the
ottoman
domination
these
countries
have
not
the
life
left
in
them
to
reclaim
themselves
and
must
look
abroad
for
reconstruction
if
you
cross
the
euphrates
by
the
bridge
that
carries
the
bagdad
railway
you
enter
a
vast
landscape
of
steppes
as
virgin
to
the
eye
as
any
prairie
across
the
mississippi
only
the
mounds
with
which
it
is
studded
witness
to
the
density
of
its
ancient
population
for
northern
mesopotamia
was
once
so
populous
and
full
of
riches
that
rome
and
the
rulers
of
iran
fought
seven
centuries
for
its
possession
till
the
arabs
conquered
it
from
both
the

now
reached

the
roman

defended
and

urfa
named

by
alexander

after
their
macedonian
city
of

later
the
seat
of

culture
whose
missionaries
were
heard
in
china
and
travancore
still
famous
under
arab
dominion
for
its
veronica
and
churches
and
restored
for
a
moment
to
christendom
as
the
capital
of
a
crusader
principality
till
the
mongols
trampled
it
into
oblivion
and
the
osmanlis
made
it
a
name
for
butchery
from
urfa
to
nisibin
there
can
be
fields
again
the
climate
has
not
changed
and
wherever
the
bedawi
pitches
his
tents
and
scratches
the
ground
there
is
proof
of
the
old
fertility
only
anarchy
has
banished
cultivation
for
since
the
ottoman
pretension
was
established
over
the
land
it
has
been
the
battleground
of
brigand
tribes
kurds
from
the
hills
and
arabs
from
the
desert
skirmishing
or
herding
their
flocks
making
or
breaking
alliance
but
always
robbing
any
tiller
of
the
land
of
the
fruits
of
his
labour
if
once
rohrbach
prophesies
the
peasant
population
were
sure
of
its
life
and
property
it
would
joyfully
expand
push
out
into
the
desert
and
bring
new
land
under
the
plough
in
a
few
years
the
villages
would
spring
up
not
by
dozens
but
by
hundreds
at
present
cultivation
is
confined
to
the
armenian
an
uncertain
arc
of
green
from
aleppo
to
mosul
but
the
railway
strikes
boldly
into
the
deserted
middle
of
the
land
giving
the
arc
a
chord
and
when
strategic
interests
no
longer
debar
it
from
being
linked
up
through
aleppo
with
a
syrian
port
it
will
be
the
really
valuable
section
of
the
bagdad
system
the
railway
is
the
only
capital
enterprise
that
northern
mesopotamia
requires
for
there
is
rain
sufficient
for
the
crops
without
artificial
irrigation
reservoirs
of
population
are
the
need
the
kurds
who
come
for
winter
pasture
may
be
induced
to
stay
already
they
have
been
settling
down
in
the
western
districts
and
have
gained
a
reputation
for
industry
the
bedawin
more
fickle
husbandmen
may
settle
southward
along
the
euphrates
and
in
time
there
will
be
a
surplus
of
peasantry
from
armenia
and
syria
these
will
add
field
to
field
but
unless
some
stronger
stream
of
immigration
is
led
into
the
land
it
will
take
many
generations
to
recover
its
ancient
prosperity
for
in
the
ninth
century
northern
mesopotamia
paid
as
great
a
revenue
as
egypt
and
its
cotton
commanded
the
market
of
the
world
southern
mesopotamia
the
irak
of
the
arabs
and
babylonia
of
the
greeks
lies
desolate
like
the
north
but
is
a
contrast
to
it
in
every
other
respect
its
aspect
is
towards
the
persian
gulf
and
rohrbach
grudgingly
admits
that
down
the
tigris
to
basra
and
not
upstream
to
alexandretta
is
the
natural
channel
for
its
trade
it
gets
nothing
from
the
mediterranean
neither
trade
nor
rain
and
every
drop
of
water
for
cultivation
must
be
led
out
of
the
rivers
but
the
rivers
in
their
natural
state
are
worse
than
the
drought
their
discharge
is
extremely
variable
about
eight
times
as
great
in
april
as
in
october
they
are
always
silting
up
their
beds
and
scooping
out
others
and
when
there
are
no
men
to
interfere
they
leave
half
the
country
a
desert
and
make
the
other
half
a
swamp
yet
the
soil
when
justly
watered
is
one
of
the
richest
in
the
world
for
irak
is
an
immense
alluvial
delta
more
than
five
hundred
miles
from
end
to
end
which
the
tigris
and
euphrates
have
deposited
in
what
was
originally
the
head
of
the
persian
gulf
the
arabs
call
it
the
or
black
land
and
it
is
a
striking
change
from
the
bare
ledges
of
arabia
and
iran
which
enclose
its
flanks
and
from
the
northern
which
it
suddenly
replaces
at
samarra
if
you
are
descending
the
tigris
and
on
the
euphrates
at
hit
the
steppe
can
not
compare
with
the
in
fertility
but
the
does
not
so
readily
yield
up
its
wealth
to
become
something
better
than
a
wilderness
of
dust
and
slime
it
needs
engineering
on
the
grand
scale
and
a
mighty
population
immense
forces
working
for
immense
returns
in
a
strangely
different
environment
it
anticipated
our
modern
rhythm
of
life
by
four
thousand
years
and
then
went
back
to
desolation
five
centuries
before
industrialism
which
may
repeople
it
began
the
was
first
reclaimed
by
men
who
had
already
a
mastery
of
metals
a
system
of
writing
and
a
mature
religion
less
civilised
men
would
never
have
attempted
the
task
these
sumerians
in
the
fourth
millennium
lived
on
heaped
up
above
each
a
with
its
separate
government
and
gods
for
centralisation
was
the
one
thing
needful
to
the
country
which
the
sumerians
did
not
achieve
the
centralisers
were
semites
from
the
arabian
plateau
sargon
of
akkad
and
naram
sin
ruled
the
whole
as
early
as
hammurabi
in
already
ruled
it
from
babylon
and
the
capital
has
never
shifted
more
than
sixty
miles
since
then
babylon
on
the
euphrates
and
bagdad
on
the
tigris
are
the
alternative
points
from
which
the
can
be
controlled
just
above
them
the
first
irrigation
canals
branch
off
from
the
rivers
and
between
them
the
rivers
approach
within
miles
of
each
other
it
is
the
point
of
vantage
for
government
and
engineering
here
engineers
and
stronghanded
rulers
turned
the
waters
of
babylon
into
waters
of
life
and
the
became
a
great
heart
of
civilisation
breathing
in
sumerians
and
amorites
and
kassites
and
aramaeans
and
chaldeans
and
persians
and
greeks
and
arabs
and
breathing
out
the
works
of
man
grain
and
wool
and
babylonish
garments
inventions
still
used
in
our
and
emotions
still
felt
in
our
religion
the
land
writes
herodotus
who
saw
it
in
its
prime
has
a
little
rain
and
this
nourishes
the
corn
at
the
root
but
the
crops
are
matured
and
brought
to
harvest
by
water
from
the
river
not
as
in
egypt
by
the
river
flooding
over
the
fields
but
by
human
labour
and
for
babylonia
like
egypt
is
one
network
of
canals
the
largest
of
which
is
navigable
it
is
far
the
best
of
all
the
countries
i
know
there
is
no
attempt
at
arboriculture
figs
or
vines
or
olives
but
it
is
such
superb
that
the
average
yield
is
and
in
the
best
years
the
wheat
and
barley
there
are
a
good
four
inches
broad
in
the
blade
and
millet
and
sesame
grow
as
big
as
trees
but
i
will
not
state
the
dimensions
i
have
ascertained
because
i
know
that
for
anyone
who
has
not
visited
babylonia
and
witnessed
these
facts
about
the
crops
for
himself
they
would
be
altogether
beyond
belief
harnessed
in
the
irrigation
channels
the
tigris
and
euphrates
had
become
as
mighty
forces
of
production
as
the
nile
and
the
ganges
the
yangtse
and
the
this
herodotus
adds
is
the
best
demonstration
i
can
give
of
the
wealth
of
the
babylonians
all
the
lands
ruled
by
the
king
of
persia
are
assessed
in
addition
to
their
taxes
in
money
for
the
maintenance
of
the
king
household
and
army
in
kind
under
this
assessment
the
king
is
maintained
for
four
months
out
of
the
twelve
by
babylonia
and
for
the
remaining
eight
by
the
rest
of
asia
together
so
that
in
wealth
the
assyrian
province
is
equivalent
to
a
third
of
all
asia
the
asia
over
which
the
achaemenids
ruled
included
russian
central
asia
and
egypt
as
well
as
modern
turkey
and
persia
and
egypt
under
the
same
assessment
merely
maintained
the
local
persian
garrison
its
money
contribution
was
inferior
too
talents
as
compared
with
assyria
and
though
these
figures
may
not
be
conclusive
because
the
persian
province
of
assyria
probably
extended
over
the
northern
steppes
as
well
as
the
it
is
certain
that
under
the
arab
caliphate
when
irak
and
egypt
were
provinces
of
one
empire
for
the
second
time
in
history
irak
by
itself
paid
million
francs
annually
into
treasury
and
egypt
no
more
than
million
so
that
a
thousand
years
ago
the
productiveness
of
the
was
more
than
double
that
of
the
nile
another
measure
of
the
land
capacity
is
the
greatness
of
its
cities
herodotus
gives
statistics
of
babylon
in
the
fifth
century
walls
feet
high
feet
broad
and
miles
in
circuit
and
houses
laid
out
in
blocks
broad
straight
streets
intersecting
one
another
at
regular
intervals
at
right
angles
or
parallel
to
the
euphrates
any
one
who
reads
herodotus
description
of
babylon
or
ibn
serapion
of
bagdad
and
considers
that
these
vast
urban
masses
were
merely
centres
of
collection
and
distribution
for
the
open
country
can
infer
the
density
of
population
and
intensity
of
cultivation
over
the
face
of
the
when
the
caliph
omar
conquered
irak
from
the
persians
in
the
middle
of
the
seventh
century
and
took
an
inventory
of
what
he
had
acquired
he
found
that
there
were
hectares
of
land
under
cultivation
and
that
the
was
paid
by
householders
which
implies
a
total
population
in
town
and
country
of
more
than
souls
where
a
bare
million
and
a
half
maintains
itself
in
city
alleys
and
nomads
tents
and
in
omar
time
the
was
no
longer
at
its
best
for
a
few
years
before
the
arab
conquest
abnormally
high
floods
had
burst
the
dykes
from
below
hilla
to
above
basra
the
euphrates
broadened
into
a
swamp
and
the
tigris
deserted
its
former
and
present
bed
for
the
leaving
the
amara
district
a
desert
the
persian
government
locked
in
a
suicidal
struggle
with
rome
was
powerless
to
make
good
the
damage
and
the
shock
of
the
arab
invasion
made
it
irreparable
under
the
abbasid
caliphs
of
bagdad
the
rest
of
the
country
preserved
its
prosperity
but
in
the
thirteenth
century
hulaku
the
mongol
finished
the
work
of
the
floods
and
under
ottoman
dominion
the
has
not
recovered
can
it
still
be
reclaimed
surveys
have
been
taken
by
sir
william
willcocks
as
adviser
to
the
ottoman
ministry
of
public
works
and
his
final
conclusions
and
proposals
are
embodied
in
a
report
drawn
up
at
bagdad
in
the
delta
he
writes
may
be
classed
as
an
arid
region
of
some
hectares
all
this
land
is
capable
of
easy
levelling
and
reclamation
the
presence
of
per
cent
lime
in
the
soil
renders
reclamation
very
easy
compared
with
similar
work
in
the
dense
clays
of
egypt
one
is
never
far
away
from
the
giant
banks
of
old
canals
and
the
ruins
of
ancient
towns
but
he
does
not
expect
to
make
all
these
hectares
productive
simultaneously
as
they
are
said
to
have
been
when
omar
took
his
inventory
it
is
water
not
land
which
measures
production
and
he
reckons
that
the
average
combined
discharge
of
the
rivers
would
irrigate
hectares
in
winter
and
in
summer
of
rice
or
of
other
crops
this
is
the
eventual
maximum
for
immediate
reclamation
he
takes
hectares
in
hand
his
project
is
practically
to
restore
with
technical
improvements
the
ancient
system
of
canals
and
drains
using
the
euphrates
water
to
irrigate
everything
west
of
the
tigris
down
to
kut
and
the
and
the
water
of
the
tigris
and
its
tributaries
for
districts
east
of
that
line
adding
per
cent
for
contingencies
to
his
estimate
for
cost
of
materials
and
rates
of
labour
and
doubling
the
total
to
cover
interest
on
loans
and
subsequent
development
he
arrives
at
turkish
as
the
cost
from
first
to
last
of
irrigation
and
agricultural
works
together
and
he
estimates
that
the
hectares
reclaimed
by
this
outlay
will
produce
crops
to
the
value
of
turkish
a
year
in
other
words
the
annual
return
on
the
gross
expenditure
will
be
more
than
per
and
under
the
present
tithe
system
turkish
of
this
will
remain
with
the
owners
of
the
soil
while
will
pass
to
the
government
this
will
give
the
country
itself
a
net
return
of
per
cent
on
the
combined
gross
cost
of
irrigation
and
agricultural
works
while
the
government
after
paying
away
turkish
out
of
its
tithes
for
maintenance
charges
will
still
receive
a
clear
per
cent
per
annum
on
the
gross
cost
of
irrigation
to
which
its
share
in
the
outlay
will
be
confined
unquestionably
therefore
the
enterprise
is
exceedingly
profitable
to
all
parties
concerned
looking
further
ahead
sir
william
proposes
to
supersede
the
navigation
of
the
tigris
by
railways
and
so
set
free
the
whole
discharge
of
the
two
rivers
for
irrigation
he
contemplates
handling
annually
tons
of
cereals
and
cwt
of
cotton
and
estimates
the
future
by
the
effects
of
the
chenab
canal
in
northern
india
a
canal
traversing
lands
similar
to
those
of
mesopotamia
in
their
climate
and
in
the
condition
in
which
they
found
themselves
before
the
canal
works
were
carried
out
in
such
a
land
so
like
a
great
part
of
mesopotamia
canals
have
introduced
in
a
few
years
nearly
a
million
of
inhabitants
and
the
resurrection
of
the
country
has
been
so
rapid
that
its
very
success
was
jeopardised
by
a
railway
not
being
able
to
be
made
quickly
enough
to
transport
the
enormous
produce
a
million
of
inhabitants
that
is
the
crux
of
the
problem
labour
is
as
necessary
as
water
for
the
raising
of
crops
sir
william
barrages
and
canals
without
hands
to
turn
them
to
account
would
be
a
dead
loss
instead
of
a
profitable
investment
but
from
what
reservoir
of
population
is
this
to
be
introduced
the
german
economists
are
baffled
by
the
difficulty
it
is
useless
as
rohrbach
puts
it
to
sink
from
to
million
marks
in
restoring
the
canal
system
and
then
let
the
land
lie
idle
with
all
its
new
dams
and
channels
for
lack
of
cultivators
yet
turkey
can
never
raise
enough
settlers
for
irak
by
internal
colonisation
she
can
not
raise
them
even
for
the
minor
enterprises
at
konia
and
adapa
and
evidently
the
must
draw
its
future
cultivators
from
somewhere
beyond
the
bounds
of
western
asia
from
germany
many
germans
have
suggested
but
german
experts
curtly
dismiss
the
idea
the
first
point
rohrbach
makes
in
his
book
on
the
bagdad
railway
is
that
german
colonisation
in
anatolia
is
impossible
for
political
reasons
no
worse
service
he
declares
can
be
done
to
the
german
cause
in
the
east
than
the
propagation
of
this
idea
and
the
rise
of
turkish
nationalism
has
proved
him
right
there
remain
the
arab
lands
but
even
he
continues
if
the
turks
thought
of
foreign
colonisation
in
syria
and
mesopotamia
to
hold
the
arabs
in
check
the
political
factor
again
that
would
be
little
help
to
us
germans
for
only
very
limited
portions
of
those
countries
have
a
climate
in
which
germans
can
work
on
the
land
or
perform
any
kind
of
heavy
manual
labour
and
germany
herself
is
hard
up
for
men
for
all
prospective
developments
in
turkey
writes
trietsch
not
merely
scientific
knowledge
capital
and
organisation
are
wanted
but
men
and
germany
has
no
resources
in
men
worth
speaking
of
for
opening
up
the
islamic
world
it
is
one
of
his
arguments
for
bringing
in
the
jews
but
the
colonisation
of
palestine
will
leave
no
jews
over
for
irak
rohrbach
disposes
of
the
mouhadjirs
they
are
a
drop
in
the
bucket
and
are
no
more
adapted
to
the
climate
than
the
germans
themselves
there
is
really
nothing
for
it
he
bursts
out
in
despair
but
the
introduction
of
mohammedans
from
other
countries
where
the
climatic
conditions
of
irak
prevail
that
narrows
the
field
to
india
and
egypt
and
drives
policy
upon
the
horns
of
a
dilemma
the
colonists
must
either
remain
subjects
of
a
foreign
power
a
solution
which
could
not
be
considered
for
an
instant
by
any
turkish
government
or
else
they
must
become
turkish
subjects
a
condition
which
to
indians
and
egyptians
as
well
as
germans
would
be
prohibitive
no
one
who
has
known
good
government
would
exchange
it
for
ottoman
government
without
the
capitulations
as
a
guarantee
the
ottoman
government
has
its
own
characteristic
view
in
a
memorandum
on
railways
and
reclamation
published
by
the
ministry
of
public
works
in
a
is
given
of
the
willcocks
scheme
in
due
time
the
memorandum
proceeds
a
comprehensive
scheme
for
the
whole
of
mesopotamia
must
be
carried
out
but
apart
from
the
question
of
expense
it
is
clear
that
the
public
works
involved
will
not
be
justified
until
turkey
is
in
a
position
to
colonise
these
extensive
districts
and
this
question
can
not
be
considered
till
we
have
succeeded
in
getting
rid
of
the
capitulations
this
is
the
ottoman
pretension
egypt
rid
of
the
osmanli
and
india
where
he
never
ruled
have
kept
their
ancient
wealth
of
harvests
and
population

spare

reclamation

for

the
last
voyage

made

this
country
wrote

william
willcocks
at

up

nile
from

lakes

desperate

forbidden
region

was
filled
with
pride
to
think
that
i
belonged
to
a
race
whose
sons
even
in
this
inhospitable
waste
of
waters
were
struggling
in
the
face
of
a
thousand
discouragements
to
introduce
new
forest
trees
and
new
agricultural
products
and
ameliorate
in
some
degree
the
conditions
of

the
naked
and
miserable

how
should
i

felt

in
traversing
the
deserts

which
represent
what
was
the
richest
and
most
famous
tract
of
the

i
had
thought
that
i
was

scion
of
a
race
in
whose
hands
god
had
placed
for
hundreds
of
years
the
destinies
of
this
great
country

that
my
countrymen
could
give
no

the
