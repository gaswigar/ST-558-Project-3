chapter
i
how
the
great
wind
came
to
beacon
house
a
wind
sprang
high
in
the
west
like
a
wave
of
unreasonable
happiness
and
tore
eastward
across
england
trailing
with
it
the
frosty
scent
of
forests
and
the
cold
intoxication
of
the
sea
in
a
million
holes
and
corners
it
refreshed
a
man
like
a
flagon
and
astonished
him
like
a
blow
in
the
inmost
chambers
of
intricate
and
embowered
houses
it
woke
like
a
domestic
explosion
littering
the
floor
with
some
professor
papers
till
they
seemed
as
precious
as
fugitive
or
blowing
out
the
candle
by
which
a
boy
read
treasure
island
and
wrapping
him
in
roaring
dark
but
everywhere
it
bore
drama
into
undramatic
lives
and
carried
the
trump
of
crisis
across
the
world
many
a
harassed
mother
in
a
mean
backyard
had
looked
at
five
dwarfish
shirts
on
the
as
at
some
small
sick
tragedy
it
was
as
if
she
had
hanged
her
five
children
the
wind
came
and
they
were
full
and
kicking
as
if
five
fat
imps
had
sprung
into
them
and
far
down
in
her
oppressed
subconscious
she
those
coarse
comedies
of
her
fathers
when
the
elves
still
dwelt
in
the
homes
of
men
many
an
unnoticed
girl
in
a
dank
walled
garden
had
tossed
herself
into
the
hammock
with
the
same
intolerant
gesture
with
which
she
might
have
tossed
herself
into
the
thames
and
that
wind
rent
the
waving
wall
of
woods
and
lifted
the
hammock
like
a
balloon
and
showed
her
shapes
of
quaint
clouds
far
beyond
and
pictures
of
bright
villages
far
below
as
if
she
rode
heaven
in
a
fairy
boat
many
a
dusty
clerk
or
cleric
plodding
a
telescopic
road
of
poplars
thought
for
the
hundredth
time
that
they
were
like
the
plumes
of
a
hearse
when
this
invisible
energy
caught
and
swung
and
clashed
them
round
his
head
like
a
wreath
or
salutation
of
seraphic
wings
there
was
in
it
something
more
inspired
and
authoritative
even
than
the
old
wind
of
the
proverb
for
this
was
the
good
wind
that
blows
nobody
harm
the
flying
blast
struck
london
just
where
it
scales
the
northern
heights
terrace
above
terrace
as
precipitous
as
edinburgh
it
was
round
about
this
place
that
some
poet
probably
drunk
looked
up
astonished
at
all
those
streets
gone
skywards
and
thinking
vaguely
of
glaciers
and
roped
mountaineers
gave
it
the
name
of
swiss
cottage
which
it
has
never
been
able
to
shake
off
at
some
stage
of
those
heights
a
terrace
of
tall
gray
houses
mostly
empty
and
almost
as
desolate
as
the
grampians
curved
round
at
the
western
end
so
that
the
last
building
a
boarding
establishment
called
beacon
house
offered
abruptly
to
the
sunset
its
high
narrow
and
towering
termination
like
the
prow
of
some
deserted
ship
the
ship
however
was
not
wholly
deserted
the
proprietor
of
the
a
duke
was
one
of
those
helpless
persons
against
whom
fate
wars
in
vain
she
smiled
vaguely
both
before
and
after
all
her
calamities
she
was
too
soft
to
be
hurt
but
by
the
aid
or
rather
under
the
orders
of
a
strenuous
niece
she
always
kept
the
remains
of
a
clientele
mostly
of
young
but
listless
folks
and
there
were
actually
five
inmates
standing
disconsolately
about
the
garden
when
the
great
gale
broke
at
the
base
of
the
terminal
tower
behind
them
as
the
sea
bursts
against
the
base
of
an
outstanding
cliff
all
day
that
hill
of
houses
over
london
had
been
domed
and
sealed
up
with
cold
cloud
yet
three
men
and
two
girls
had
at
last
found
even
the
gray
and
chilly
garden
more
tolerable
than
the
black
and
cheerless
interior
when
the
wind
came
it
split
the
sky
and
shouldered
the
cloudland
left
and
right
unbarring
great
clear
furnaces
of
evening
gold
the
burst
of
light
released
and
the
burst
of
air
blowing
seemed
to
come
almost
simultaneously
and
the
wind
especially
caught
everything
in
a
throttling
violence
the
bright
short
grass
lay
all
one
way
like
brushed
hair
every
shrub
in
the
garden
tugged
at
its
roots
like
a
dog
at
the
collar
and
strained
every
leaping
leaf
after
the
hunting
and
exterminating
element
now
and
again
a
twig
would
snap
and
fly
like
a
bolt
from
an
arbalist
the
three
men
stood
stiffly
and
aslant
against
the
wind
as
if
leaning
against
a
wall
the
two
ladies
disappeared
into
the
house
rather
to
speak
truly
they
were
blown
into
the
house
their
two
frocks
blue
and
white
looked
like
two
big
broken
flowers
driving
and
drifting
upon
the
gale
nor
is
such
a
poetic
fancy
inappropriate
for
there
was
something
oddly
romantic
about
this
inrush
of
air
and
light
after
a
long
leaden
and
unlifting
day
grass
and
garden
trees
seemed
glittering
with
something
at
once
good
and
unnatural
like
a
fire
from
fairyland
it
seemed
like
a
strange
sunrise
at
the
wrong
end
of
the
day
the
girl
in
white
dived
in
quickly
enough
for
she
wore
a
white
hat
of
the
proportions
of
a
parachute
which
might
have
wafted
her
away
into
the
coloured
clouds
of
evening
she
was
their
one
splash
of
splendour
and
irradiated
wealth
in
that
impecunious
place
staying
there
temporarily
with
a
friend
an
heiress
in
a
small
way
by
name
rosamund
hunt
but
resolute
and
rather
boisterous
on
top
of
her
wealth
she
was
and
rather
but
she
had
not
married
perhaps
because
there
was
always
a
crowd
of
men
around
her
she
was
not
fast
though
some
might
have
called
her
vulgar
but
she
gave
irresolute
youths
an
impression
of
being
at
once
popular
and
inaccessible
a
man
felt
as
if
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
cleopatra
or
as
if
he
were
asking
for
a
great
actress
at
the
stage
door
indeed
some
theatrical
spangles
seemed
to
cling
about
miss
hunt
she
played
the
guitar
and
the
mandoline
she
always
wanted
charades
and
with
that
great
rending
of
the
sky
by
sun
and
storm
she
felt
a
girlish
melodrama
swell
again
within
her
to
the
crashing
orchestration
of
the
air
the
clouds
rose
like
the
curtain
of
some
pantomime
nor
oddly
was
the
girl
in
blue
entirely
unimpressed
by
this
apocalypse
in
a
private
garden
though
she
was
one
of
most
prosaic
and
practical
creatures
alive
she
was
indeed
no
other
than
the
strenuous
niece
whose
strength
alone
upheld
that
mansion
of
decay
but
as
the
gale
swung
and
swelled
the
blue
and
white
skirts
till
they
took
on
the
monstrous
contours
of
victorian
crinolines
a
sunken
memory
stirred
in
her
that
was
almost
romance
a
memory
of
a
dusty
volume
of
in
an
aunt
house
in
infancy
pictures
of
crinoline
hoops
and
croquet
hoops
and
some
pretty
story
of
which
perhaps
they
were
a
part
this
fragrance
in
her
thoughts
faded
almost
instantly
and
diana
duke
entered
the
house
even
more
promptly
than
her
companion
tall
slim
aquiline
and
dark
she
seemed
made
for
such
swiftness
in
body
she
was
of
the
breed
of
those
birds
and
beasts
that
are
at
once
long
and
alert
like
greyhounds
or
herons
or
even
like
an
innocent
snake
the
whole
house
revolved
on
her
as
on
a
rod
of
steel
it
would
be
wrong
to
say
that
she
commanded
for
her
own
efficiency
was
so
impatient
that
she
obeyed
herself
before
any
one
else
obeyed
her
before
electricians
could
mend
a
bell
or
locksmiths
open
a
door
before
dentists
could
pluck
a
tooth
or
butlers
draw
a
tight
cork
it
was
done
already
with
the
silent
violence
of
her
slim
hands
she
was
light
but
there
was
nothing
leaping
about
her
lightness
she
spurned
the
ground
and
she
meant
to
spurn
it
people
talk
of
the
pathos
and
failure
of
plain
women
but
it
is
a
more
terrible
thing
that
a
beautiful
woman
may
succeed
in
everything
but
womanhood
it
enough
to
blow
your
head
off
said
the
young
woman
in
white
going
to
the
the
young
woman
in
blue
made
no
reply
but
put
away
her
gardening
gloves
and
then
went
to
the
sideboard
and
began
to
spread
out
an
afternoon
cloth
for
tea
enough
to
blow
your
head
off
i
say
said
miss
rosamund
hunt
with
the
unruffled
cheeriness
of
one
whose
songs
and
speeches
had
always
been
safe
for
an
encore
only
your
hat
i
think
said
diana
duke
but
i
dare
say
that
is
sometimes
more
important
rosamund
face
showed
for
an
instant
the
offence
of
a
spoilt
child
and
then
the
humour
of
a
very
healthy
person
she
broke
into
a
laugh
and
said
well
it
would
have
to
be
a
big
wind
to
blow
your
head
off
there
was
another
silence
and
the
sunset
breaking
more
and
more
from
the
sundering
clouds
filled
the
room
with
soft
fire
and
painted
the
dull
walls
with
ruby
and
gold
somebody
once
told
me
said
rosamund
hunt
that
it
easier
to
keep
one
head
when
one
has
lost
one
heart
oh
do
talk
such
rubbish
said
diana
with
savage
sharpness
outside
the
garden
was
clad
in
a
golden
splendour
but
the
wind
was
still
stiffly
blowing
and
the
three
men
who
stood
their
ground
might
also
have
considered
the
problem
of
hats
and
heads
and
indeed
their
position
touching
hats
was
somewhat
typical
of
them
the
tallest
of
the
three
abode
the
blast
in
a
high
silk
hat
which
the
wind
seemed
to
charge
as
vainly
as
that
other
sullen
tower
the
house
behind
him
the
second
man
tried
to
hold
on
a
stiff
straw
hat
at
all
angles
and
ultimately
held
it
in
his
hand
the
third
had
no
hat
and
by
his
attitude
seemed
never
to
have
had
one
in
his
life
perhaps
this
wind
was
a
kind
of
fairy
wand
to
test
men
and
women
for
there
was
much
of
the
three
men
in
this
difference
the
man
in
the
solid
silk
hat
was
the
embodiment
of
silkiness
and
solidity
he
was
a
big
bland
bored
and
as
some
said
boring
man
with
flat
fair
hair
and
handsome
heavy
features
a
prosperous
young
doctor
by
the
name
of
warner
but
if
his
blondness
and
blandness
seemed
at
first
a
little
fatuous
it
is
certain
that
he
was
no
fool
if
rosamund
hunt
was
the
only
person
there
with
much
money
he
was
the
only
person
who
had
as
yet
found
any
kind
of
fame
his
treatise
on
the
probable
existence
of
pain
in
the
lowest
organisms
had
been
universally
hailed
by
the
scientific
world
as
at
once
solid
and
daring
in
short
he
undoubtedly
had
brains
and
perhaps
it
was
not
his
fault
if
they
were
the
kind
of
brains
that
most
men
desire
to
analyze
with
a
poker
the
young
man
who
put
his
hat
off
and
on
was
a
scientific
amateur
in
a
small
way
and
worshipped
the
great
warner
with
a
solemn
freshness
it
was
in
fact
at
his
invitation
that
the
distinguished
doctor
was
present
for
warner
lived
in
no
such
ramshackle
but
in
a
professional
palace
in
harley
street
this
young
man
was
really
the
youngest
and
of
the
three
but
he
was
one
of
those
persons
both
male
and
female
who
seem
doomed
to
be
and
insignificant
and
shy
he
seemed
to
lose
the
delicacy
of
his
features
in
a
sort
of
blur
of
brown
and
red
as
he
stood
blushing
and
blinking
against
the
wind
he
was
one
of
those
obvious
unnoticeable
people
every
one
knew
that
he
was
arthur
inglewood
unmarried
moral
decidedly
intelligent
living
on
a
little
money
of
his
own
and
hiding
himself
in
the
two
hobbies
of
photography
and
cycling
everybody
knew
him
and
forgot
him
even
as
he
stood
there
in
the
glare
of
golden
sunset
there
was
something
about
him
indistinct
like
one
of
his
own
amateur
photographs
the
third
man
had
no
hat
he
was
lean
in
light
vaguely
sporting
clothes
and
the
large
pipe
in
his
mouth
made
him
look
all
the
leaner
he
had
a
long
ironical
face
hair
the
blue
eyes
of
an
irishman
and
the
blue
chin
of
an
actor
an
irishman
he
was
an
actor
he
was
not
except
in
the
old
days
of
miss
hunt
charades
being
as
a
matter
of
fact
an
obscure
and
flippant
journalist
named
michael
moon
he
had
once
been
hazily
supposed
to
be
reading
for
the
bar
but
as
warner
would
say
with
his
rather
elephantine
wit
it
was
mostly
at
another
kind
of
bar
that
his
friends
found
him
moon
however
did
not
drink
nor
even
frequently
get
drunk
he
simply
was
a
gentleman
who
liked
low
company
this
was
partly
because
company
is
quieter
than
society
and
if
he
enjoyed
talking
to
a
barmaid
as
apparently
he
did
it
was
chiefly
because
the
barmaid
did
the
talking
moreover
he
would
often
bring
other
talent
to
assist
her
he
shared
that
strange
trick
of
all
men
of
his
type
intellectual
and
without
ambition
the
trick
of
going
about
with
his
mental
inferiors
there
was
a
small
resilient
jew
named
moses
gould
in
the
same
a
man
whose
negro
vitality
and
vulgarity
amused
michael
so
much
that
he
went
round
with
him
from
bar
to
bar
like
the
owner
of
a
performing
monkey
the
colossal
clearance
which
the
wind
had
made
of
that
cloudy
sky
grew
clearer
and
clearer
chamber
within
chamber
seemed
to
open
in
heaven
one
felt
one
might
at
last
find
something
lighter
than
light
in
the
fullness
of
this
silent
effulgence
all
things
collected
their
colours
again
the
gray
trunks
turned
silver
and
the
drab
gravel
gold
one
bird
fluttered
like
a
loosened
leaf
from
one
tree
to
another
and
his
brown
feathers
were
brushed
with
fire
inglewood
said
michael
moon
with
his
blue
eye
on
the
bird
have
you
any
friends
warner
mistook
the
person
addressed
and
turning
a
broad
beaming
face
said
oh
yes
i
go
out
a
great
deal
michael
moon
gave
a
tragic
grin
and
waited
for
his
real
informant
who
spoke
a
moment
after
in
a
voice
curiously
cool
fresh
and
young
as
coming
out
of
that
brown
and
even
dusty
interior
really
answered
inglewood
i
afraid
i
lost
touch
with
my
old
friends
the
greatest
friend
i
ever
had
was
at
school
a
fellow
named
smith
it
odd
you
should
mention
it
because
i
was
thinking
of
him
though
i
have
seen
him
for
seven
or
eight
years
he
was
on
the
science
side
with
me
at
school
a
clever
fellow
though
queer
and
he
went
up
to
oxford
when
i
went
to
germany
the
fact
is
it
rather
a
sad
story
i
often
asked
him
to
come
and
see
me
and
when
i
heard
nothing
i
made
inquiries
you
know
i
was
shocked
to
learn
that
poor
smith
had
gone
off
his
head
the
accounts
were
a
bit
cloudy
of
course
some
saying
that
he
had
recovered
again
but
they
always
say
that
about
a
year
ago
i
got
a
telegram
from
him
myself
the
telegram
i
sorry
to
say
put
the
matter
beyond
a
doubt
quite
so
assented
warner
stolidly
insanity
is
generally
incurable
so
is
sanity
said
the
irishman
and
studied
him
with
a
dreary
eye
symptoms
asked
the
doctor
what
was
this
telegram
it
a
shame
to
joke
about
such
things
said
inglewood
in
his
honest
embarrassed
way
the
telegram
was
smith
illness
not
smith
the
actual
words
were
found
alive
with
two
legs
alive
with
two
legs
repeated
michael
frowning
perhaps
a
version
of
alive
and
kicking
i
do
know
much
about
people
out
of
their
senses
but
i
suppose
they
ought
to
be
kicking
and
people
in
their
senses
asked
warner
smiling
oh
they
ought
to
be
kicked
said
michael
with
sudden
heartiness
the
message
is
clearly
insane
continued
the
impenetrable
warner
the
best
test
is
a
reference
to
the
undeveloped
normal
type
even
a
baby
does
not
expect
to
find
a
man
with
three
legs
three
legs
said
michael
moon
would
be
very
convenient
in
this
wind
a
fresh
eruption
of
the
atmosphere
had
indeed
almost
thrown
them
off
their
balance
and
broken
the
blackened
trees
in
the
garden
beyond
all
sorts
of
accidental
objects
could
be
seen
scouring
the
sky
straws
sticks
rags
papers
and
in
the
distance
a
disappearing
hat
its
disappearance
however
was
not
final
after
an
interval
of
minutes
they
saw
it
again
much
larger
and
closer
like
a
white
panama
towering
up
into
the
heavens
like
a
balloon
staggering
to
and
fro
for
an
instant
like
a
stricken
kite
and
then
settling
in
the
centre
of
their
own
lawn
as
falteringly
as
a
fallen
leaf
somebody
lost
a
good
hat
said
warner
shortly
almost
as
he
spoke
another
object
came
over
the
garden
wall
flying
after
the
fluttering
panama
it
was
a
big
green
umbrella
after
that
came
hurtling
a
huge
yellow
gladstone
bag
and
after
that
came
a
figure
like
a
flying
wheel
of
legs
as
in
the
shield
of
the
isle
of
man
but
though
for
a
flash
it
seemed
to
have
five
or
six
legs
it
alighted
upon
two
like
the
man
in
the
queer
telegram
it
took
the
form
of
a
large
man
in
gay
green
holiday
clothes
he
had
bright
blonde
hair
that
the
wind
brushed
back
like
a
german
a
flushed
eager
face
like
a
cherub
and
a
prominent
pointing
nose
a
little
like
a
dog
his
head
however
was
by
no
means
cherubic
in
the
sense
of
being
without
a
body
on
the
contrary
on
his
vast
shoulders
and
shape
generally
gigantesque
his
head
looked
oddly
and
unnaturally
small
this
gave
rise
to
a
scientific
theory
which
his
conduct
fully
supported
that
he
was
an
idiot
inglewood
had
a
politeness
instinctive
and
yet
awkward
his
life
was
full
of
arrested
half
gestures
of
assistance
and
even
this
prodigy
of
a
big
man
in
green
leaping
the
wall
like
a
bright
green
grasshopper
did
not
paralyze
that
small
altruism
of
his
habits
in
such
a
matter
as
a
lost
hat
he
was
stepping
forward
to
recover
the
green
when
he
was
struck
rigid
with
a
roar
like
a
bull
unsportsmanlike
bellowed
the
big
man
give
it
fair
play
give
it
fair
play
and
he
came
after
his
own
hat
quickly
but
cautiously
with
burning
eyes
the
hat
had
seemed
at
first
to
droop
and
dawdle
as
in
ostentatious
langour
on
the
sunny
lawn
but
the
wind
again
freshening
and
rising
it
went
dancing
down
the
garden
with
the
devilry
of
a
de
the
eccentric
went
bounding
after
it
with
kangaroo
leaps
and
bursts
of
breathless
speech
of
which
it
was
not
always
easy
to
pick
up
the
thread
fair

started
a

in
bramber
combe
hat
at
bay
mangled

got
him
as
the
wind
rose
out
of
a
roar
into
a
shriek
he
leapt
into
the
sky
on
his
strong
fantastic
legs
snatched
at
the
vanishing
hat
missed
it
and
pitched
sprawling
face
foremost
on
the
grass
the
hat
rose
over
him
like
a
bird
in
triumph
but
its
triumph
was
premature
for
the
lunatic
flung
forward
on
his
hands
threw
up
his
boots
behind
waved
his
two
legs
in
the
air
like
symbolic
ensigns
so
that
they
actually
thought
again
of
the
telegram
and
actually
caught
the
hat
with
his
feet
a
prolonged
and
piercing
yell
of
wind
split
the
welkin
from
end
to
end
the
eyes
of
all
the
men
were
blinded
by
the
invisible
blast
as
by
a
strange
clear
cataract
of
transparency
rushing
between
them
and
all
objects
about
them
but
as
the
large
man
fell
back
in
a
sitting
posture
and
solemnly
crowned
himself
with
the
hat
michael
found
to
his
incredulous
surprise
that
he
had
been
holding
his
breath
like
a
man
watching
a
duel
while
that
tall
wind
was
at
the
top
of
its
energy
another
short
cry
was
heard
beginning
very
querulous
but
ending
very
quick
swallowed
in
abrupt
silence
the
shiny
black
cylinder
of
warner
official
hat
sailed
off
his
head
in
the
long
smooth
parabola
of
an
airship
and
in
almost
cresting
a
garden
tree
was
caught
in
the
topmost
branches
another
hat
was
gone
those
in
that
garden
felt
themselves
caught
in
an
unaccustomed
eddy
of
things
happening
no
one
seemed
to
know
what
would
blow
away
next
before
they
could
speculate
the
cheering
and
hallooing
was
already
halfway
up
the
tree
swinging
himself
from
fork
to
fork
with
his
strong
bent
grasshopper
legs
and
still
giving
forth
his
gasping
mysterious
comments

give

up
the
tree
swung
and
swept
and
thrashed
to
and
fro
in
the
thundering
wind
like
a
thistle
and
flamed
in
the
full
sunshine
like
a
bonfire
the
green
fantastic
human
figure
vivid
against
its
autumn
red
and
gold
was
already
among
its
highest
and
craziest
branches
which
by
bare
luck
did
not
break
with
the
weight
of
his
big
body
he
was
up
there
among
the
last
tossing
leaves
and
the
first
twinkling
stars
of
evening
still
talking
to
himself
cheerfully
reasoningly
half
apologetically
in
little
gasps
he
might
well
be
out
of
breath
for
his
whole
preposterous
raid
had
gone
with
one
rush
he
had
bounded
the
wall
once
like
a
football
swept
down
the
garden
like
a
slide
and
shot
up
the
tree
like
a
rocket
the
other
three
men
seemed
buried
under
incident
piled
on
incident
a
wild
world
where
one
thing
began
before
another
thing
left
off
all
three
had
the
first
thought
the
tree
had
been
there
for
the
five
years
they
had
known
the
each
one
of
them
was
active
and
strong
no
one
of
them
had
even
thought
of
climbing
it
beyond
that
inglewood
felt
first
the
mere
fact
of
colour
the
bright
brisk
leaves
the
bleak
blue
sky
the
wild
green
arms
and
legs
reminded
him
irrationally
of
something
glowing
in
his
infancy
something
akin
to
a
gaudy
man
on
a
golden
tree
perhaps
it
was
only
painted
monkey
on
a
stick
oddly
enough
michael
moon
though
more
of
a
humourist
was
touched
on
a
tenderer
nerve
half
remembered
the
old
young
theatricals
with
rosamund
and
was
amused
to
find
himself
almost
quoting
shakespeare
for
valour
is
not
love
a
hercules
still
climbing
trees
in
the
hesperides
even
the
immovable
man
of
science
had
a
bright
bewildered
sensation
that
the
time
machine
had
given
a
great
jerk
and
gone
forward
with
rather
rattling
rapidity
he
was
not
however
wholly
prepared
for
what
happened
next
the
man
in
green
riding
the
frail
topmost
bough
like
a
witch
on
a
very
risky
broomstick
reached
up
and
rent
the
black
hat
from
its
airy
nest
of
twigs
it
had
been
broken
across
a
heavy
bough
in
the
first
burst
of
its
passage
a
tangle
of
branches
in
torn
and
scored
and
scratched
it
in
every
direction
a
clap
of
wind
and
foliage
had
flattened
it
like
a
concertina
nor
can
it
be
said
that
the
obliging
gentleman
with
the
sharp
nose
showed
any
adequate
tenderness
for
its
structure
when
he
finally
unhooked
it
from
its
place
when
he
had
found
it
however
his
proceedings
were
by
some
counted
singular
he
waved
it
with
a
loud
whoop
of
triumph
and
then
immediately
appeared
to
fall
backwards
off
the
tree
to
which
however
he
remained
attached
by
his
long
strong
legs
like
a
monkey
swung
by
his
tail
hanging
thus
head
downwards
above
the
unhelmed
warner
he
gravely
proceeded
to
drop
the
battered
silk
cylinder
upon
his
brows
every
man
a
king
explained
the
inverted
philosopher
every
hat
consequently
a
crown
but
this
is
a
crown
out
of
heaven
and
he
again
attempted
the
coronation
of
warner
who
however
moved
away
with
great
abruptness
from
the
hovering
diadem
not
seeming
strangely
enough
to
wish
for
his
former
decoration
in
its
present
state

the
obliging

the

in

speaking
thus
with
a
wild
comfortableness
he
settled
or
smashed
the
shapeless
silk
hat
over
the
face
of
the
disturbed
physician
and
fell
on
his
feet
among
the
other
men
still
talking
beaming
and
breathless
why
do
they
make
more
games
out
of
wind
he
asked
in
some
excitement
kites
are
all
right
but
why
should
it
only
be
kites
why
i
thought
of
three
other
games
for
a
windy
day
while
i
was
climbing
that
tree
here
one
of
them
you
take
a
lot
of
pepper
i
think
interposed
moon
with
a
sardonic
mildness
that
your
games
are
already
sufficiently
interesting
are
you
may
i
ask
a
professional
acrobat
on
a
tour
or
a
travelling
advertisement
of
sunny
jim
how
and
why
do
you
display
all
this
energy
for
clearing
walls
and
climbing
trees
in
our
melancholy
but
at
least
rational
suburbs
the
stranger
so
far
as
so
loud
a
person
was
capable
of
it
appeared
to
grow
confidential
well
it
a
trick
of
my
own
he
confessed
candidly
i
do
it
by
having
two
legs
arthur
inglewood
who
had
sunk
into
the
background
of
this
scene
of
folly
started
and
stared
at
the
newcomer
with
his
eyes
screwed
up
and
his
high
colour
slightly
heightened
why
i
believe
you
smith
he
cried
with
his
fresh
almost
boyish
voice
and
then
after
an
instant
stare
and
yet
i
not
sure
i
have
a
card
i
think
said
the
unknown
with
baffling
solemnity
a
card
with
my
real
name
my
titles
offices
and
true
purpose
on
this
earth
he
drew
out
slowly
from
an
upper
waistcoat
pocket
a
scarlet
and
as
slowly
produced
a
very
large
card
even
in
the
instant
of
its
production
they
fancied
it
was
of
a
queer
shape
unlike
the
cards
of
ordinary
gentlemen
but
it
was
there
only
for
an
instant
for
as
it
passed
from
his
fingers
to
arthur
one
or
another
slipped
his
hold
the
strident
tearing
gale
in
that
garden
carried
away
the
stranger
card
to
join
the
wild
waste
paper
of
the
universe
and
that
great
western
wind
shook
the
whole
house
and
passed
chapter
ii
the
luggage
of
an
optimist
we
all
remember
the
fairy
tales
of
science
in
our
infancy
which
played
with
the
supposition
that
large
animals
could
jump
in
the
proportion
of
small
ones
if
an
elephant
were
as
strong
as
a
grasshopper
he
could
i
suppose
spring
clean
out
of
the
zoological
gardens
and
alight
trumpeting
upon
primrose
hill
if
a
whale
could
leap
from
the
sea
like
a
trout
perhaps
men
might
look
up
and
see
one
soaring
above
yarmouth
like
the
winged
island
of
laputa
such
natural
energy
though
sublime
might
certainly
be
inconvenient
and
much
of
this
inconvenience
attended
the
gaiety
and
good
intentions
of
the
man
in
green
he
was
too
large
for
everything
because
he
was
lively
as
well
as
large
by
a
fortunate
physical
provision
most
very
substantial
creatures
are
also
reposeful
and
in
the
lesser
parts
of
london
are
not
built
for
a
man
as
big
as
a
bull
and
excitable
as
a
kitten
when
inglewood
followed
the
stranger
into
the
he
found
him
talking
earnestly
and
in
his
own
opinion
privately
to
the
helpless
duke
that
fat
faint
lady
could
only
goggle
up
like
a
dying
fish
at
the
enormous
new
gentleman
who
politely
offered
himself
as
a
lodger
with
vast
gestures
of
the
wide
white
hat
in
one
hand
and
the
yellow
gladstone
bag
in
the
other
fortunately
duke
more
efficient
niece
and
partner
was
there
to
complete
the
contract
for
indeed
all
the
people
of
the
house
had
somehow
collected
in
the
room
this
fact
in
truth
was
typical
of
the
whole
episode
the
visitor
created
an
atmosphere
of
comic
crisis
and
from
the
time
he
came
into
the
house
to
the
time
he
left
it
he
somehow
got
the
company
to
gather
and
even
follow
though
in
derision
as
children
gather
and
follow
a
punch
and
judy
an
hour
ago
and
for
four
years
previously
these
people
had
avoided
each
other
even
when
they
had
really
liked
each
other
they
had
slid
in
and
out
of
dismal
and
deserted
rooms
in
search
of
particular
newspapers
or
private
needlework
even
now
they
all
came
casually
as
with
varying
interests
but
they
all
came
there
was
the
embarrassed
inglewood
still
a
sort
of
red
shadow
there
was
the
unembarrassed
warner
a
pallid
but
solid
substance
there
was
michael
moon
offering
like
a
riddle
the
contrast
of
the
horsy
crudeness
of
his
clothes
and
the
sombre
sagacity
of
his
visage
he
was
now
joined
by
his
yet
more
comic
crony
moses
gould
swaggering
on
short
legs
with
a
prosperous
purple
tie
he
was
the
gayest
of
godless
little
dogs
but
like
a
dog
also
in
this
that
however
he
danced
and
wagged
with
delight
the
two
dark
eyes
on
each
side
of
his
protuberant
nose
glistened
gloomily
like
black
buttons
there
was
miss
rosamund
hunt
still
with
the
fine
white
hat
framing
her
square
face
and
still
with
her
native
air
of
being
dressed
for
some
party
that
never
came
off
she
also
like
mr
moon
had
a
new
companion
new
so
far
as
this
narrative
goes
but
in
reality
an
old
friend
and
a
protegee
this
was
a
slight
young
woman
in
dark
gray
and
in
no
way
notable
but
for
a
load
of
dull
red
hair
of
which
the
shape
somehow
gave
her
pale
face
that
triangular
almost
peaked
appearance
which
was
given
by
the
lowering
headdress
and
deep
rich
ruff
of
the
elizabethan
beauties
her
surname
seemed
to
be
gray
and
miss
hunt
called
her
mary
in
that
indescribable
tone
applied
to
a
dependent
who
has
practically
become
a
friend
she
wore
a
small
silver
cross
on
her
very
gray
clothes
and
was
the
only
member
of
the
party
who
went
to
church
last
but
the
reverse
of
least
there
was
diana
duke
studying
the
newcomer
with
eyes
of
steel
and
listening
carefully
to
every
idiotic
word
he
said
as
for
duke
she
smiled
up
at
him
but
never
dreamed
of
listening
to
him
she
had
never
really
listened
to
any
one
in
her
life
which
some
said
was
why
she
had
survived
nevertheless
duke
was
pleased
with
her
new
concentration
of
courtesy
upon
herself
for
no
one
ever
spoke
seriously
to
her
any
more
than
she
listened
seriously
to
any
one
and
she
almost
beamed
as
the
stranger
with
yet
wider
and
almost
whirling
gestures
of
explanation
with
his
huge
hat
and
bag
apologized
for
having
entered
by
the
wall
instead
of
the
front
door
he
was
understood
to
put
it
down
to
an
unfortunate
family
tradition
of
neatness
and
care
of
his
clothes
my
mother
was
rather
strict
about
it
to
tell
the
truth
he
said
lowering
his
voice
to
duke
she
never
liked
me
to
lose
my
cap
at
school
and
when
a
man
been
taught
to
be
tidy
and
neat
it
sticks
to
him
duke
weakly
gasped
that
she
was
sure
he
must
have
had
a
good
mother
but
her
niece
seemed
inclined
to
probe
the
matter
further
you
got
a
funny
idea
of
neatness
she
said
if
jumping
garden
walls
and
clambering
up
garden
trees
a
man
ca
very
well
climb
a
tree
tidily
he
can
clear
a
wall
neatly
said
michael
moon
i
saw
him
do
it
smith
seemed
to
be
regarding
the
girl
with
genuine
astonishment
my
dear
young
lady
he
said
i
was
tidying
the
tree
you
do
want
last
year
hats
there
do
you
any
more
than
last
year
leaves
the
wind
takes
off
the
leaves
but
it
could
manage
the
hat
that
wind
i
suppose
has
tidied
whole
forests
rum
idea
this
is
that
tidiness
is
a
timid
quiet
sort
of
thing
why
tidiness
is
a
toil
for
giants
you
ca
tidy
anything
without
untidying
yourself
just
look
at
my
trousers
do
you
know
that
have
you
ever
had
a
spring
cleaning
oh
yes
sir
said
duke
almost
eagerly
you
will
find
everything
of
that
sort
quite
nice
for
the
first
time
she
had
heard
two
words
that
she
could
understand
miss
diana
duke
seemed
to
be
studying
the
stranger
with
a
sort
of
spasm
of
calculation
then
her
black
eyes
snapped
with
decision
and
she
said
that
he
could
have
a
particular
bedroom
on
the
top
floor
if
he
liked
and
the
silent
and
sensitive
inglewood
who
had
been
on
the
rack
through
these
eagerly
offered
to
show
him
up
to
the
room
smith
went
up
the
stairs
four
at
a
time
and
when
he
bumped
his
head
against
the
ultimate
ceiling
inglewood
had
an
odd
sensation
that
the
tall
house
was
much
shorter
than
it
used
to
be
arthur
inglewood
followed
his
old
friend
or
his
new
friend
for
he
did
not
very
clearly
know
which
he
was
the
face
looked
very
like
his
old
schoolfellow
at
one
second
and
very
unlike
at
another
and
when
inglewood
broke
through
his
native
politeness
so
far
as
to
say
suddenly
is
your
name
smith
he
received
only
the
unenlightening
reply
quite
right
quite
right
very
good
excellent
which
appeared
to
inglewood
on
reflection
rather
the
speech
of
a
babe
accepting
a
name
than
of
a
man
admitting
one
despite
these
doubts
about
identity
the
hapless
inglewood
watched
the
other
unpack
and
stood
about
his
bedroom
in
all
the
impotent
attitudes
of
the
male
friend
smith
unpacked
with
the
same
kind
of
whirling
accuracy
with
which
he
climbed
a
tree
throwing
things
out
of
his
bag
as
if
they
were
rubbish
yet
managing
to
distribute
quite
a
regular
pattern
all
round
him
on
the
floor
as
he
did
so
he
continued
to
talk
in
the
same
somewhat
gasping
manner
he
had
come
upstairs
four
steps
at
a
time
but
even
without
this
his
style
of
speech
was
breathless
and
fragmentary
and
his
remarks
were
still
a
string
of
more
or
less
significant
but
often
separate
pictures
like
the
day
of
judgement
he
said
throwing
a
bottle
so
that
it
somehow
settled
rocking
on
its
right
end
people
say
vast
universe
infinity
and
astronomy
not
sure
i
think
things
are
too
close
together
packed
up
for
travelling
stars
too
close
really
why
the
a
star
too
close
to
be
seen
properly
the
earth
a
star
too
close
to
be
seen
at
all
too
many
pebbles
on
the
beach
ought
all
to
be
put
in
rings
too
many
blades
of
grass
to
study
feathers
on
a
bird
make
the
brain
reel
wait
till
the
big
bag
is
unpacked
may
all
be
put
in
our
right
places
then
here
he
stopped
literally
for
breath
throwing
a
shirt
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
and
then
a
bottle
of
ink
so
that
it
fell
quite
neatly
beyond
it
inglewood
looked
round
on
this
strange
disorder
with
an
increasing
doubt
in
fact
the
more
one
explored
smith
holiday
luggage
the
less
one
could
make
anything
of
it
one
peculiarity
of
it
was
that
almost
everything
seemed
to
be
there
for
the
wrong
reason
what
is
secondary
with
every
one
else
was
primary
with
him
he
would
wrap
up
a
pot
or
pan
in
brown
paper
and
the
unthinking
assistant
would
discover
that
the
pot
was
valueless
or
even
unnecessary
and
that
it
was
the
brown
paper
that
was
truly
precious
he
produced
two
or
three
boxes
of
cigars
and
explained
with
plain
and
perplexing
sincerity
that
he
was
no
smoker
but
that
wood
was
by
far
the
best
for
fretwork
he
also
exhibited
about
six
small
bottles
of
wine
white
and
red
and
inglewood
happening
to
note
a
volnay
which
he
knew
to
be
excellent
supposed
at
first
that
the
stranger
was
an
epicure
in
vintages
he
was
therefore
surprised
to
find
that
the
next
bottle
was
a
vile
sham
claret
from
the
colonies
which
even
colonials
to
do
them
justice
do
not
drink
it
was
only
then
that
he
observed
that
all
six
bottles
had
those
bright
metallic
seals
of
various
tints
and
seemed
to
have
been
chosen
solely
because
they
have
the
three
primary
and
three
secondary
colours
red
blue
and
yellow
green
violet
and
orange
there
grew
upon
inglewood
an
almost
creepy
sense
of
the
real
childishness
of
this
creature
for
smith
was
really
so
far
as
human
psychology
can
be
innocent
he
had
the
sensualities
of
innocence
he
loved
the
stickiness
of
gum
and
he
cut
white
wood
greedily
as
if
he
were
cutting
a
cake
to
this
man
wine
was
not
a
doubtful
thing
to
be
defended
or
denounced
it
was
a
quaintly
coloured
syrup
such
as
a
child
sees
in
a
shop
window
he
talked
dominantly
and
rushed
the
social
situation
but
he
was
not
asserting
himself
like
a
superman
in
a
modern
play
he
was
simply
forgetting
himself
like
a
little
boy
at
a
party
he
had
somehow
made
the
giant
stride
from
babyhood
to
manhood
and
missed
that
crisis
in
youth
when
most
of
us
grow
old
as
he
shunted
his
big
bag
arthur
observed
the
initials
printed
on
one
side
of
it
and
remembered
that
smith
had
been
called
innocent
smith
at
school
though
whether
as
a
formal
christian
name
or
a
moral
description
he
could
not
remember
he
was
just
about
to
venture
another
question
when
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
and
the
short
figure
of
gould
offered
itself
with
the
melancholy
moon
standing
like
his
tall
crooked
shadow
behind
him
they
had
drifted
up
the
stairs
after
the
other
two
men
with
the
wandering
gregariousness
of
the
male
hope
there
no
intrusion
said
the
beaming
moses
with
a
glow
of
good
nature
but
not
the
airiest
tinge
of
apology
the
truth
is
said
michael
moon
with
comparative
courtesy
we
thought
we
might
see
if
they
had
made
you
comfortable
miss
duke
is
rather
i
know
cried
the
stranger
looking
up
radiantly
from
his
bag
magnificent
is
she
go
close
to
her
hear
military
music
going
by
like
joan
of
arc
inglewood
stared
and
stared
at
the
speaker
like
one
who
has
just
heard
a
wild
fairy
tale
which
nevertheless
contains
one
small
and
forgotten
fact
for
he
remembered
how
he
had
himself
thought
of
jeanne
years
ago
when
hardly
more
than
a
schoolboy
he
had
first
come
to
the
long
since
the
pulverizing
rationalism
of
his
friend
warner
had
crushed
such
youthful
ignorances
and
disproportionate
dreams
under
the
warnerian
scepticism
and
science
of
hopeless
human
types
inglewood
had
long
come
to
regard
himself
as
a
timid
insufficient
and
weak
type
who
would
never
marry
to
regard
diana
duke
as
a
materialistic
maidservant
and
to
regard
his
first
fancy
for
her
as
the
small
dull
farce
of
a
collegian
kissing
his
landlady
daughter
and
yet
the
phrase
about
military
music
moved
him
queerly
as
if
he
had
heard
those
distant
drums
she
has
to
keep
things
pretty
tight
as
is
only
natural
said
moon
glancing
round
the
rather
dwarfish
room
with
its
wedge
of
slanted
ceiling
like
the
conical
hood
of
a
dwarf
rather
a
small
box
for
you
sir
said
the
waggish
gould
splendid
room
though
answered
smith
enthusiastically
with
his
head
inside
his
gladstone
bag
i
love
these
pointed
sorts
of
rooms
like
gothic
by
the
way
he
cried
out
pointing
in
quite
a
startling
way
where
does
that
door
lead
to
to
certain
death
i
should
say
answered
michael
moon
staring
up
at
a
and
disused
trapdoor
in
the
sloping
roof
of
the
attic
i
do
think
there
a
loft
there
and
i
do
know
what
else
it
could
lead
to
long
before
he
had
finished
his
sentence
the
man
with
the
strong
green
legs
had
leapt
at
the
door
in
the
ceiling
swung
himself
somehow
on
to
the
ledge
beneath
it
wrenched
it
open
after
a
struggle
and
clambered
through
it
for
a
moment
they
saw
the
two
symbolic
legs
standing
like
a
truncated
statue
then
they
vanished
through
the
hole
thus
burst
in
the
roof
appeared
the
empty
and
lucid
sky
of
evening
with
one
great
cloud
sailing
across
it
like
a
whole
county
upside
down
hullo
you
fellows
came
the
far
cry
of
innocent
smith
apparently
from
some
remote
pinnacle
come
up
here
and
bring
some
of
my
things
to
eat
and
drink
it
just
the
spot
for
a
picnic
with
a
sudden
impulse
michael
snatched
two
of
the
small
bottles
of
wine
one
in
each
solid
fist
and
arthur
inglewood
as
if
mesmerized
groped
for
a
biscuit
tin
and
a
big
jar
of
ginger
the
enormous
hand
of
innocent
smith
appearing
through
the
aperture
like
a
giant
in
a
fairy
tale
received
these
tributes
and
bore
them
off
to
the
eyrie
then
they
both
hoisted
themselves
out
of
the
window
they
were
both
athletic
and
even
gymnastic
inglewood
through
his
concern
for
hygiene
and
moon
through
his
concern
for
sport
which
was
not
quite
so
idle
and
inactive
as
that
of
the
average
sportsman
also
they
both
had
a
burst
of
celestial
sensation
when
the
door
was
burst
in
the
roof
as
if
a
door
had
been
burst
in
the
sky
and
they
could
climb
out
on
to
the
very
roof
of
the
universe
they
were
both
men
who
had
long
been
unconsciously
imprisoned
in
the
commonplace
though
one
took
it
comically
and
the
other
seriously
they
were
both
men
nevertheless
in
whom
sentiment
had
never
died
but
moses
gould
had
an
equal
contempt
for
their
suicidal
athletics
and
their
subconscious
transcendentalism
and
he
stood
and
laughed
at
the
thing
with
the
shameless
rationality
of
another
race
when
the
singular
smith
astride
of
a
learnt
that
gould
was
not
following
his
infantile
officiousness
and
good
nature
forced
him
to
dive
back
into
the
attic
to
comfort
or
persuade
and
inglewood
and
moon
were
left
alone
on
the
long
ridge
of
the
slate
roof
with
their
feet
against
gutters
and
their
backs
against
looking
agnostically
at
each
other
their
first
feeling
was
that
they
had
come
out
into
eternity
and
that
eternity
was
very
like
one
definition
occurred
to
both
of
them
that
he
had
come
out
into
the
light
of
that
lucid
and
radiant
ignorance
in
which
all
beliefs
had
begun
the
sky
above
them
was
full
of
mythology
heaven
seemed
deep
enough
to
hold
all
the
gods
the
round
of
the
ether
turned
from
green
to
yellow
gradually
like
a
great
unripe
fruit
all
around
the
sunken
sun
it
was
like
a
lemon
round
all
the
east
it
was
a
sort
of
golden
green
more
suggestive
of
a
greengage
but
the
whole
had
still
the
emptiness
of
daylight
and
none
of
the
secrecy
of
dusk
tumbled
here
and
there
across
this
gold
and
pale
green
were
shards
and
shattered
masses
of
inky
purple
cloud
which
seemed
falling
towards
the
earth
in
every
kind
of
colossal
perspective
one
of
them
really
had
the
character
of
some
assyrian
image
huge
head
downwards
hurled
out
of
heaven
a
sort
of
false
jehovah
who
was
perhaps
satan
all
the
other
clouds
had
preposterous
pinnacled
shapes
as
if
the
palaces
had
been
flung
after
him
and
yet
while
the
empty
heaven
was
full
of
silent
catastrophe
the
height
of
human
buildings
above
which
they
sat
held
here
and
there
a
tiny
trivial
noise
that
was
the
exact
antithesis
and
they
heard
some
six
streets
below
a
newsboy
calling
and
a
bell
bidding
to
chapel
they
could
also
hear
talk
out
of
the
garden
below
and
realized
that
the
irrepressible
smith
must
have
followed
gould
downstairs
for
his
eager
and
pleading
accents
could
be
heard
followed
by
the
protests
of
miss
duke
and
the
full
and
very
youthful
laughter
of
rosamund
hunt
the
air
had
that
cold
kindness
that
comes
after
a
storm
michael
moon
drank
it
in
with
as
serious
a
relish
as
he
had
drunk
the
little
bottle
of
cheap
claret
which
he
had
emptied
almost
at
a
draught
inglewood
went
on
eating
ginger
very
slowly
and
with
a
solemnity
unfathomable
as
the
sky
above
him
there
was
still
enough
stir
in
the
freshness
of
the
atmosphere
to
make
them
almost
fancy
they
could
smell
the
garden
soil
and
the
last
roses
of
autumn
suddenly
there
came
from
the
darkening
room
a
silvery
ping
and
pong
which
told
them
that
rosamund
had
brought
out
the
mandoline
after
the
first
few
notes
there
was
more
of
the
distant
laughter
inglewood
said
michael
moon
have
you
ever
heard
that
i
am
a
blackguard
i
have
heard
it
and
i
do
believe
it
answered
inglewood
after
an
odd
pause
but
i
have
heard
you
were
what
they
call
rather
wild
if
you
have
heard
that
i
am
wild
you
can
contradict
the
rumour
said
moon
with
an
extraordinary
calm
i
am
tame
i
am
quite
tame
i
am
about
the
tamest
beast
that
crawls
i
drink
too
much
of
the
same
kind
of
whisky
at
the
same
time
every
night
i
even
drink
about
the
same
amount
too
much
i
go
to
the
same
number
of
i
meet
the
same
damned
women
with
mauve
faces
i
hear
the
same
number
of
dirty
stories
generally
the
same
dirty
stories
you
may
assure
my
friends
inglewood
that
you
see
before
you
a
person
whom
civilization
has
thoroughly
tamed
arthur
inglewood
was
staring
with
feelings
that
made
him
nearly
fall
off
the
roof
for
indeed
the
irishman
face
always
sinister
was
now
almost
demoniacal
christ
confound
it
cried
out
moon
suddenly
clutching
the
empty
claret
bottle
this
is
about
the
thinnest
and
filthiest
wine
i
ever
uncorked
and
it
the
only
drink
i
have
really
enjoyed
for
nine
years
i
was
never
wild
until
just
ten
minutes
ago
and
he
sent
the
bottle
whizzing
a
wheel
of
glass
far
away
beyond
the
garden
into
the
road
where
in
the
profound
evening
silence
they
could
even
hear
it
break
and
part
upon
the
stones
moon
said
arthur
inglewood
rather
huskily
you
must
be
so
bitter
about
it
everyone
has
to
take
the
world
as
he
finds
it
of
course
one
often
finds
it
a
bit
dull
that
fellow
does
said
michael
decisively
i
mean
that
fellow
smith
i
have
a
fancy
there
some
method
in
his
madness
it
looks
as
if
he
could
turn
into
a
sort
of
wonderland
any
minute
by
taking
one
step
out
of
the
plain
road
who
would
have
thought
of
that
trapdoor
who
would
have
thought
that
this
cursed
colonial
claret
could
taste
quite
nice
among
the
perhaps
that
is
the
real
key
of
fairyland
perhaps
nosey

beastly
little
empire
cigarettes
ought
only
to
be
smoked
on

or
something
of
that
sort
perhaps
cold

of
mutton
would
seem
quite
appetizing
at
the

of
a

the

your

the

who
do
fellows
like
me
i
mean
have
just
the
same
feeling
that
it
all
rather
flat
and
a
failure
but
the
world
made
like
that
it

people
are
made

are

to
stick
quiet

i

you
much
cleverer
than
i
am
but
you
ca
help
having
all
the
loose
ways
of
a
poor
literary

and
i
ca
help
having
all
the
doubts
and
helplessness
of

said
so
well
in
that
lecture
really
consists
of
quite
different
tribes
of
animals
all
disguised
as
men
in
the
dim
garden
below
the
buzz
of
talk
was
suddenly
broken
by
miss
hunt
musical
instrument
banging
with
the
abruptness
of
artillery
into
a
vulgar
but
spirited
tune
rosamund
voice
came
up
rich
and
strong
in
the
words
of
some
fatuous
fashionable
coon
song
darkies
sing
a
song
on
the
old
plantation
sing
it
as
we
sang
it
in
days
long
since
gone
by
inglewood
brown
eyes
softened
and
saddened
still
more
as
he
continued
his
monologue
of
resignation
to
such
a
rollicking
and
romantic
tune
but
the
blue
eyes
of
michael
moon
brightened
and
hardened
with
a
light
that
inglewood
did
not
understand
many
centuries
and
many
villages
and
valleys
would
have
been
happier
if
inglewood
or
inglewood
countrymen
had
ever
understood
that
light
or
guessed
at
the
first
blink
that
it
was
the
battle
star
of
ireland
nothing
can
ever
alter
it
it
in
the
wheels
of
the
universe
went
on
inglewood
in
a
low
voice
some
men
are
weak
and
some
strong
and
the
only
thing
we
can
do
is
to
know
that
we
are
weak
i
have
been
in
love
lots
of
times
but
i
could
not
do
anything
for
i
remembered
my
own
fickleness
i
have
formed
opinions
but
i
have
the
cheek
to
push
them
because
i
so
often
changed
them
that
the
upshot
old
fellow
we
ca
trust
ourselves
and
we
ca
help
it
michael
had
risen
to
his
feet
and
stood
poised
in
a
perilous
position
at
the
end
of
the
roof
like
some
dark
statue
hung
above
its
gable
behind
him
huge
clouds
of
an
almost
impossible
purple
turned
slowly
in
the
silent
anarchy
of
heaven
their
gyration
made
the
dark
figure
seem
yet
dizzier
let
us
he
said
and
was
suddenly
silent
let
us
what
asked
arthur
inglewood
rising
equally
quick
though
somewhat
more
cautiously
for
his
friend
seemed
to
find
some
difficulty
in
speech
let
us
go
and
do
some
of
these
things
we
ca
do
said
michael
at
the
same
moment
there
burst
out
of
the
trapdoor
below
them
the
cockatoo
hair
and
flushed
face
of
innocent
smith
calling
to
them
that
they
must
come
down
as
the
concert
was
in
full
swing
and
moses
gould
was
about
to
recite
young
lochinvar
as
they
dropped
into
innocent
attic
they
nearly
tumbled
over
its
entertaining
impedimenta
again
inglewood
staring
at
the
littered
floor
thought
instinctively
of
the
littered
floor
of
a
nursery
he
was
therefore
the
more
moved
and
even
shocked
when
his
eye
fell
on
a
large
american
revolver
hullo
he
cried
stepping
back
from
the
steely
glitter
as
men
step
back
from
a
serpent
are
you
afraid
of
burglars
or
when
and
why
do
you
deal
death
out
of
that
machine
gun
oh
that
said
smith
throwing
it
a
single
glance
i
deal
life
out
of
that
and
he
went
bounding
down
the
stairs
chapter
iii
the
banner
of
beacon
all
next
day
at
beacon
house
there
was
a
crazy
sense
that
it
was
everybody
birthday
it
is
the
fashion
to
talk
of
institutions
as
cold
and
cramping
things
the
truth
is
that
when
people
are
in
exceptionally
high
spirits
really
wild
with
freedom
and
invention
they
always
must
and
they
always
do
create
institutions
when
men
are
weary
they
fall
into
anarchy
but
while
they
are
gay
and
vigorous
they
invariably
make
rules
this
which
is
true
of
all
the
churches
and
republics
of
history
is
also
true
of
the
most
trivial
parlour
game
or
the
most
unsophisticated
meadow
romp
we
are
never
free
until
some
institution
frees
us
and
liberty
can
not
exist
till
it
is
declared
by
authority
even
the
wild
authority
of
the
harlequin
smith
was
still
authority
because
it
produced
everywhere
a
crop
of
crazy
regulations
and
conditions
he
filled
every
one
with
his
own
life
but
it
was
not
expressed
in
destruction
but
rather
in
a
dizzy
and
toppling
construction
each
person
with
a
hobby
found
it
turning
into
an
institution
rosamund
songs
seemed
to
coalesce
into
a
kind
of
opera
michael
jests
and
paragraphs
into
a
magazine
his
pipe
and
her
mandoline
seemed
between
them
to
make
a
sort
of
smoking
concert
the
bashful
and
bewildered
arthur
inglewood
almost
struggled
against
his
own
growing
importance
he
felt
as
if
in
spite
of
him
his
photographs
were
turning
into
a
picture
gallery
and
his
bicycle
into
a
gymkhana
but
no
one
had
any
time
to
criticize
these
impromptu
estates
and
offices
for
they
followed
each
other
in
wild
succession
like
the
topics
of
a
rambling
talker
existence
with
such
a
man
was
an
obstacle
race
made
out
of
pleasant
obstacles
out
of
any
homely
and
trivial
object
he
could
drag
reels
of
exaggeration
like
a
conjurer
nothing
could
be
more
shy
and
impersonal
than
poor
arthur
photography
yet
the
preposterous
smith
was
seen
assisting
him
eagerly
through
sunny
morning
hours
and
an
indefensible
sequence
described
as
moral
photography
began
to
unroll
about
the
it
was
only
a
version
of
the
old
photographer
joke
which
produces
the
same
figure
twice
on
one
plate
making
a
man
play
chess
with
himself
dine
with
himself
and
so
on
but
these
plates
were
more
hysterical
and
ambitious
as
miss
hunt
forgets
herself
showing
that
lady
answering
her
own
too
rapturous
recognition
with
a
most
appalling
stare
of
ignorance
or
mr
moon
questions
himself
in
which
mr
moon
appeared
as
one
driven
to
madness
under
his
own
legal
which
was
conducted
with
a
long
forefinger
and
an
air
of
ferocious
waggery
one
highly
successful
trilogy
representing
inglewood
recognizing
inglewood
inglewood
prostrating
himself
before
inglewood
and
inglewood
severely
beating
inglewood
with
an
umbrella
innocent
smith
wanted
to
have
enlarged
and
put
up
in
the
hall
like
a
sort
of
fresco
with
the
inscription
these
three
alone
will
make
a
man
a
prig
tennyson
nothing
again
could
be
more
prosaic
and
impenetrable
than
the
domestic
energies
of
miss
diana
duke
but
innocent
had
somehow
blundered
on
the
discovery
that
her
thrifty
dressmaking
went
with
a
considerable
feminine
care
for
dress
the
one
feminine
thing
that
had
never
failed
her
solitary
in
consequence
smith
pestered
her
with
a
theory
which
he
really
seemed
to
take
seriously
that
ladies
might
combine
economy
with
magnificence
if
they
would
draw
light
chalk
patterns
on
a
plain
dress
and
then
dust
them
off
again
he
set
up
smith
lightning
dressmaking
company
with
two
screens
a
cardboard
placard
and
box
of
bright
soft
crayons
and
miss
diana
actually
threw
him
an
abandoned
black
overall
or
working
dress
on
which
to
exercise
the
talents
of
a
modiste
he
promptly
produced
for
her
a
garment
aflame
with
red
and
gold
sunflowers
she
held
it
up
an
instant
to
her
shoulders
and
looked
like
an
empress
and
arthur
inglewood
some
hours
afterwards
cleaning
his
bicycle
with
his
usual
air
of
being
inextricably
hidden
in
it
glanced
up
and
his
hot
face
grew
hotter
for
diana
stood
laughing
for
one
flash
in
the
doorway
and
her
dark
robe
was
rich
with
the
green
and
purple
of
great
decorative
peacocks
like
a
secret
garden
in
the
arabian
nights
a
pang
too
swift
to
be
named
pain
or
pleasure
went
through
his
heart
like
an
rapier
he
remembered
how
pretty
he
thought
her
years
ago
when
he
was
ready
to
fall
in
love
with
anybody
but
it
was
like
remembering
a
worship
of
some
babylonian
princess
in
some
previous
existence
at
his
next
glimpse
of
her
and
he
caught
himself
awaiting
it
the
purple
and
green
chalk
was
dusted
off
and
she
went
by
quickly
in
her
working
clothes
as
for
duke
none
who
knew
that
matron
could
conceive
her
as
actively
resisting
this
invasion
that
had
turned
her
house
upside
down
but
among
the
most
exact
observers
it
was
seriously
believed
that
she
liked
it
for
she
was
one
of
those
women
who
at
bottom
regard
all
men
as
equally
mad
wild
animals
of
some
utterly
separate
species
and
it
is
doubtful
if
she
really
saw
anything
more
eccentric
or
inexplicable
in
smith
picnics
or
crimson
sunflowers
than
she
had
in
the
chemicals
of
inglewood
or
the
sardonic
speeches
of
moon
courtesy
on
the
other
hand
is
a
thing
that
anybody
can
understand
and
smith
manners
were
as
courteous
as
they
were
unconventional
she
said
he
was
a
real
gentleman
by
which
she
simply
meant
a
man
which
is
a
very
different
thing
she
would
sit
at
the
head
of
the
table
with
fat
folded
hands
and
a
fat
folded
smile
for
hours
and
hours
while
every
one
else
was
talking
at
once
at
least
the
only
other
exception
was
rosamund
companion
mary
gray
whose
silence
was
of
a
much
more
eager
sort
though
she
never
spoke
she
always
looked
as
if
she
might
speak
any
minute
perhaps
this
is
the
very
definition
of
a
companion
innocent
smith
seemed
to
throw
himself
as
into
other
adventures
into
the
adventure
of
making
her
talk
he
never
succeeded
yet
he
was
never
snubbed
if
he
achieved
anything
it
was
only
to
draw
attention
to
this
quiet
figure
and
to
turn
her
by
ever
so
little
from
a
modesty
to
a
mystery
but
if
she
was
a
riddle
every
one
recognized
that
she
was
a
fresh
and
unspoilt
riddle
like
the
riddle
of
the
sky
and
the
woods
in
spring
indeed
though
she
was
rather
older
than
the
other
two
girls
she
had
an
early
morning
ardour
a
fresh
earnestness
of
youth
which
rosamund
seemed
to
have
lost
in
the
mere
spending
of
money
and
diana
in
the
mere
guarding
of
it
smith
looked
at
her
again
and
again
her
eyes
and
mouth
were
set
in
her
face
the
wrong
way
which
was
really
the
right
way
she
had
the
knack
of
saying
everything
with
her
face
her
silence
was
a
sort
of
steady
applause
but
among
the
hilarious
experiments
of
that
holiday
which
seemed
more
like
a
week
holiday
than
a
day
one
experiment
towers
supreme
not
because
it
was
any
sillier
or
more
successful
than
the
others
but
because
out
of
this
particular
folly
flowed
all
of
the
odd
events
that
were
to
follow
all
the
other
practical
jokes
exploded
of
themselves
and
left
vacancy
all
the
other
fictions
returned
upon
themselves
and
were
finished
like
a
song
but
the
string
of
solid
and
startling
events
which
were
to
include
a
hansom
cab
a
detective
a
pistol
and
a
marriage
licence
were
all
made
primarily
possible
by
the
joke
about
the
high
court
of
beacon
it
had
originated
not
with
innocent
smith
but
with
michael
moon
he
was
in
a
strange
glow
and
pressure
of
spirits
and
talked
incessantly
yet
he
had
never
been
more
sarcastic
and
even
inhuman
he
used
his
old
useless
knowledge
as
a
barrister
to
talk
entertainingly
of
a
tribunal
that
was
a
parody
on
the
pompous
anomalies
of
english
law
the
high
court
of
beacon
he
declared
was
a
splendid
example
of
our
free
and
sensible
constitution
it
had
been
founded
by
king
john
in
defiance
of
the
magna
carta
and
now
held
absolute
power
over
windmills
wine
and
spirit
licences
ladies
traveling
in
turkey
revision
of
sentences
for
and
parricide
as
well
as
anything
whatever
that
happened
in
the
town
of
market
bosworth
the
whole
hundred
and
nine
seneschals
of
the
high
court
of
beacon
met
once
in
every
four
centuries
but
in
the
intervals
as
mr
moon
explained
the
whole
powers
of
the
institution
were
vested
in
duke
tossed
about
among
the
rest
of
the
company
however
the
high
court
did
not
retain
its
historical
and
legal
seriousness
but
was
used
somewhat
unscrupulously
in
a
riot
of
domestic
detail
if
somebody
spilt
the
worcester
sauce
on
the
tablecloth
he
was
quite
sure
it
was
a
rite
without
which
the
sittings
and
findings
of
the
court
would
be
invalid
or
if
somebody
wanted
a
window
to
remain
shut
he
would
suddenly
remember
that
none
but
the
third
son
of
the
lord
of
the
manor
of
penge
had
the
right
to
open
it
they
even
went
to
the
length
of
making
arrests
and
conducting
criminal
inquiries
the
proposed
trial
of
moses
gould
for
patriotism
was
rather
above
the
heads
of
the
company
especially
of
the
criminal
but
the
trial
of
inglewood
on
a
charge
of
photographic
libel
and
his
triumphant
acquittal
upon
a
plea
of
insanity
were
admitted
to
be
in
the
best
tradition
of
the
court
but
when
smith
was
in
wild
spirits
he
grew
more
and
more
serious
not
more
and
more
flippant
like
michael
moon
this
proposal
of
a
private
court
of
justice
which
moon
had
thrown
off
with
the
detachment
of
a
political
humourist
smith
really
caught
hold
of
with
the
eagerness
of
an
abstract
philosopher
it
was
by
far
the
best
thing
they
could
do
he
declared
to
claim
sovereign
powers
even
for
the
individual
household
you
believe
in
home
rule
for
ireland
i
believe
in
home
rule
for
homes
he
cried
eagerly
to
michael
it
would
be
better
if
every
father
could
kill
his
son
as
with
the
old
romans
it
would
be
better
because
nobody
would
be
killed
let
issue
a
declaration
of
independence
from
beacon
house
we
could
grow
enough
greens
in
that
garden
to
support
us
and
when
the
comes
let
tell
him
we
and
play
on
him
with
the
hose
well
perhaps
as
you
say
we
could
very
well
have
a
hose
as
that
comes
from
the
main
but
we
could
sink
a
well
in
this
chalk
and
a
lot
could
be
done
with
let
this
really
be
beacon
house
let
light
a
bonfire
of
independence
on
the
roof
and
see
house
after
house
answering
it
across
the
valley
of
the
thames
let
us
begin
the
league
of
the
free
families
away
with
local
government
a
fig
for
local
patriotism
let
every
house
be
a
sovereign
state
as
this
is
and
judge
its
own
children
by
its
own
law
as
we
do
by
the
court
of
beacon
let
us
cut
the
painter
and
begin
to
be
happy
together
as
if
we
were
on
a
desert
island
i
know
that
desert
island
said
michael
moon
it
only
exists
in
the
family
robinson
a
man
feels
a
strange
desire
for
some
sort
of
vegetable
milk
and
crash
comes
down
some
unexpected
from
some
undiscovered
monkey
a
literary
man
feels
inclined
to
pen
a
sonnet
and
at
once
an
officious
porcupine
rushes
out
of
a
thicket
and
shoots
out
one
of
his
quills
do
you
say
a
word
against
the
family
robinson
cried
innocent
with
great
warmth
it
may
be
exact
science
but
it
dead
accurate
philosophy
when
you
really
shipwrecked
you
do
really
find
what
you
want
when
you
really
on
a
desert
island
you
never
find
it
a
desert
if
we
were
really
besieged
in
this
garden
we
find
a
hundred
english
birds
and
english
berries
that
we
never
knew
were
here
if
we
were
snowed
up
in
this
room
we
be
the
better
for
reading
scores
of
books
in
that
bookcase
that
we
do
even
know
are
there
we
have
talks
with
each
other
good
terrible
talks
that
we
shall
go
to
the
grave
without
guessing
we
find
materials
for
everything
christening
marriage
or
funeral
yes
even
for
a
coronation
if
we
did
decide
to
be
a
republic
a
coronation
on
family
lines
i
suppose
said
michael
laughing
oh
i
know
you
would
find
everything
in
that
atmosphere
if
we
wanted
such
a
simple
thing
for
instance
as
a
coronation
canopy
we
should
walk
down
beyond
the
geraniums
and
find
the
canopy
tree
in
full
bloom
if
we
wanted
such
a
trifle
as
a
crown
of
gold
why
we
should
be
digging
up
dandelions
and
we
should
find
a
gold
mine
under
the
lawn
and
when
we
wanted
oil
for
the
ceremony
why
i
suppose
a
great
storm
would
wash
everything
on
shore
and
we
should
find
there
was
a
whale
on
the
premises
and
so
there
is
a
whale
on
the
premises
for
all
you
know
asseverated
smith
striking
the
table
with
passion
i
bet
you
never
examined
the
premises
i
bet
never
been
round
at
the
back
as
i
was
this
morning
for
i
found
the
very
thing
you
say
could
only
grow
on
a
tree
there
an
old
sort
of
square
tent
up
against
the
dustbin
it
got
three
holes
in
the
canvas
and
a
pole
broken
so
it
not
much
good
as
a
tent
but
as
a
canopy
and
his
voice
quite
failed
him
to
express
its
shining
adequacy
then
he
went
on
with
controversial
eagerness
you
see
i
take
every
challenge
as
you
make
it
i
believe
every
blessed
thing
you
say
could
be
here
has
been
here
all
the
time
you
say
you
want
a
whale
washed
up
for
oil
why
there
oil
in
that
at
your
elbow
and
i
do
believe
anybody
has
touched
it
or
thought
of
it
for
years
and
as
for
your
gold
crown
we
none
of
us
wealthy
here
but
we
could
collect
enough
bits
from
our
own
pockets
to
string
round
a
man
head
for
half
an
hour
or
one
of
miss
hunt
gold
bangles
is
nearly
big
enough
to
the
rosamund
was
almost
choking
with
laughter
all
is
not
gold
that
glitters
she
said
and
besides
what
a
mistake
that
is
cried
innocent
smith
leaping
up
in
great
excitement
all
is
gold
that
glitters
especially
now
we
are
a
sovereign
state
what
the
good
of
a
sovereign
state
if
you
ca
define
a
sovereign
we
can
make
anything
a
precious
metal
as
men
could
in
the
morning
of
the
world
they
did
choose
gold
because
it
was
rare
your
scientists
can
tell
you
twenty
sorts
of
slime
much
rarer
they
chose
gold
because
it
was
bright
because
it
was
a
hard
thing
to
find
but
pretty
when
you
found
it
you
ca
fight
with
golden
swords
or
eat
golden
biscuits
you
can
only
look
at
it
and
you
can
look
at
it
out
here
with
one
of
his
incalculable
motions
he
sprang
back
and
burst
open
the
doors
into
the
garden
at
the
same
time
also
with
one
of
his
gestures
that
never
seemed
at
the
instant
so
unconventional
as
they
were
he
stretched
out
his
hand
to
mary
gray
and
led
her
out
on
to
the
lawn
as
if
for
a
dance
the
french
windows
thus
flung
open
let
in
an
evening
even
lovelier
than
that
of
the
day
before
the
west
was
swimming
with
sanguine
colours
and
a
sort
of
sleepy
flame
lay
along
the
lawn
the
twisted
shadows
of
the
one
or
two
garden
trees
showed
upon
this
sheen
not
gray
or
black
as
in
common
daylight
but
like
arabesques
written
in
vivid
violet
ink
on
some
page
of
eastern
gold
the
sunset
was
one
of
those
festive
and
yet
mysterious
conflagrations
in
which
common
things
by
their
colours
remind
us
of
costly
or
curious
things
the
slates
upon
the
sloping
roof
burned
like
the
plumes
of
a
vast
peacock
in
every
mysterious
blend
of
blue
and
green
the
bricks
of
the
wall
glowed
with
all
the
october
tints
of
strong
ruby
and
tawny
wines
the
sun
seemed
to
set
each
object
alight
with
a
different
coloured
flame
like
a
man
lighting
fireworks
and
even
innocent
hair
which
was
of
a
rather
colourless
fairness
seemed
to
have
a
flame
of
pagan
gold
on
it
as
he
strode
across
the
lawn
towards
the
one
tall
ridge
of
rockery
what
would
be
the
good
of
gold
he
was
saying
if
it
did
not
glitter
why
should
we
care
for
a
black
sovereign
any
more
than
for
a
black
sun
at
noon
a
black
button
would
do
just
as
well
do
you
see
that
everything
in
this
garden
looks
like
a
jewel
and
will
you
kindly
tell
me
what
the
deuce
is
the
good
of
a
jewel
except
that
it
looks
like
a
jewel
leave
off
buying
and
selling
and
start
looking
open
your
eyes
and
you
wake
up
in
the
new
jerusalem
all
is
gold
that
glitters
tree
and
tower
of
brass
rolls
the
golden
evening
air
down
the
golden
grass
kick
the
cry
to
jericho
how
yellow
mud
is
sold
all
is
gold
that
glitters
for
the
glitter
is
the
gold
and
who
wrote
that
asked
rosamund
amused
no
one
will
ever
write
it
answered
smith
and
cleared
the
rockery
with
a
flying
leap
really
said
rosamund
to
michael
moon
he
ought
to
be
sent
to
an
asylum
do
you
think
so
i
beg
your
pardon
inquired
michael
rather
sombrely
his
long
swarthy
head
was
dark
against
the
sunset
and
either
by
accident
or
mood
he
had
the
look
of
something
isolated
and
even
hostile
amid
the
social
extravagance
of
the
garden
i
only
said
smith
ought
to
go
to
an
asylum
repeated
the
lady
the
lean
face
seemed
to
grow
longer
and
longer
for
moon
was
unmistakably
sneering
no
he
said
i
do
think
at
all
necessary
what
do
you
mean
asked
rosamund
quickly
why
not
because
he
is
in
one
now
answered
michael
moon
in
a
quiet
but
ugly
voice
why
did
you
know
what
cried
the
girl
and
there
was
a
break
in
her
voice
for
the
irishman
face
and
voice
were
really
almost
creepy
with
his
dark
figure
and
dark
sayings
in
all
that
sunshine
he
looked
like
the
devil
in
paradise
i
sorry
he
continued
with
a
sort
of
harsh
humility
of
course
we
do
talk
about
it
much
but
i
thought
we
all
really
knew
knew
what
well
answered
moon
that
beacon
house
is
a
certain
rather
singular
sort
of
house
a
house
with
the
tiles
loose
shall
we
say
innocent
smith
is
only
the
doctor
that
visits
us
had
you
come
when
he
called
before
as
most
of
our
maladies
are
melancholic
of
course
he
has
to
be
extra
cheery
sanity
of
course
seems
a
very
bumptious
eccentric
thing
to
us
jumping
over
a
wall
climbing
a
tree
that
his
bedside
manner
you
dare
say
such
a
thing
cried
rosamund
in
a
rage
you
dare
suggest
that
i
not
more
than
i
am
said
michael
soothingly
not
more
than
the
rest
of
us
have
you
ever
noticed
that
miss
duke
never
sits
still
a
notorious
sign
have
you
ever
observed
that
inglewood
is
always
washing
his
hands
a
known
mark
of
mental
disease
i
of
course
am
a
dipsomaniac
i
do
believe
you
broke
out
his
companion
not
without
agitation
i
heard
you
had
some
bad
habits
all
habits
are
bad
habits
said
michael
with
deadly
calm
madness
does
not
come
by
breaking
out
but
by
giving
in
by
settling
down
in
some
dirty
little
circle
of
ideas
by
being
tamed
you
went
mad
about
money
because
you
an
heiress
it
a
lie
cried
rosamund
furiously
i
never
was
mean
about
money
you
were
worse
said
michael
in
a
low
voice
and
yet
violently
you
thought
that
other
people
were
you
thought
every
man
who
came
near
you
must
be
a
you
would
not
let
yourself
go
and
be
sane
and
now
you
mad
and
i
mad
and
serve
us
right
you
brute
said
rosamund
quite
white
and
is
this
true
with
the
intellectual
cruelty
of
which
the
celt
is
capable
when
his
abysses
are
in
revolt
michael
was
silent
for
some
seconds
and
then
stepped
back
with
an
ironical
bow
not
literally
true
of
course
he
said
only
really
true
an
allegory
shall
we
say
a
social
satire
and
i
hate
and
despise
your
satires
cried
rosamund
hunt
letting
loose
her
whole
forcible
female
personality
like
a
cyclone
and
speaking
every
word
to
wound
i
despise
it
as
i
despise
your
rank
tobacco
and
your
nasty
loungy
ways
and
your
snarling
and
your
radicalism
and
your
old
clothes
and
your
potty
little
newspaper
and
your
rotten
failure
at
everything
i
do
care
whether
you
call
it
snobbishness
or
not
i
like
life
and
success
and
jolly
things
to
look
at
and
action
you
wo
frighten
me
with
diogenes
i
prefer
alexander
victrix
causa
deae
said
michael
gloomily
and
this
angered
her
more
as
not
knowing
what
it
meant
she
imagined
it
to
be
witty
oh
i
dare
say
you
know
greek
she
said
with
cheerful
inaccuracy
you
have
done
much
with
that
either
and
she
crossed
the
garden
pursuing
the
vanished
innocent
and
mary
in
doing
so
she
passed
inglewood
who
was
returning
to
the
house
slowly
and
with
a
brow
he
was
one
of
those
men
who
are
quite
clever
but
quite
the
reverse
of
quick
as
he
came
back
out
of
the
sunset
garden
into
the
twilight
parlour
diana
duke
slipped
swiftly
to
her
feet
and
began
putting
away
the
tea
things
but
it
was
not
before
inglewood
had
seen
an
instantaneous
picture
so
unique
that
he
might
well
have
snapshotted
it
with
his
everlasting
camera
for
diana
had
been
sitting
in
front
of
her
unfinished
work
with
her
chin
on
her
hand
looking
straight
out
of
the
window
in
pure
thoughtless
thought
you
are
busy
said
arthur
oddly
embarrassed
with
what
he
had
seen
and
wishing
to
ignore
it
there
no
time
for
dreaming
in
this
world
answered
the
young
lady
with
her
back
to
him
i
have
been
thinking
lately
said
inglewood
in
a
low
voice
that
there
no
time
for
waking
up
she
did
not
reply
and
he
walked
to
the
window
and
looked
out
on
the
garden
i
do
smoke
or
drink
you
know
he
said
irrelevantly
because
i
think
they
drugs
and
yet
i
fancy
all
hobbies
like
my
camera
and
bicycle
are
drugs
too
getting
under
a
black
hood
getting
into
a
dark
room
getting
into
a
hole
anyhow
drugging
myself
with
speed
and
sunshine
and
fatigue
and
fresh
air
pedalling
the
machine
so
fast
that
i
turn
into
a
machine
myself
that
the
matter
with
all
of
us
we
too
busy
to
wake
up
well
said
the
girl
solidly
what
is
there
to
wake
up
to
there
must
be
cried
inglewood
turning
round
in
a
singular
excitement
there
must
be
something
to
wake
up
to
all
we
do
is
preparations
your
cleanliness
and
my
healthiness
and
warner
scientific
appliances
we
always
preparing
for
something
something
that
never
comes
off
i
ventilate
the
house
and
you
sweep
the
house
but
what
is
going
to
happen
in
the
house
she
was
looking
at
him
quietly
but
with
very
bright
eyes
and
seemed
to
be
searching
for
some
form
of
words
which
she
could
not
find
before
she
could
speak
the
door
burst
open
and
the
boisterous
rosamund
hunt
in
her
flamboyant
white
hat
boa
and
parasol
stood
framed
in
the
doorway
she
was
in
a
breathing
heat
and
on
her
open
face
was
an
expression
of
the
most
infantile
astonishment
well
here
a
fine
game
she
said
panting
what
am
i
to
do
now
i
wonder
i
wired
for
warner
that
all
i
can
think
of
doing
what
is
the
matter
asked
diana
rather
sharply
but
moving
forward
like
one
used
to
be
called
upon
for
assistance
it
mary
said
the
heiress
my
companion
mary
gray
that
cracked
friend
of
yours
called
smith
has
proposed
to
her
in
the
garden
after
ten
hours
acquaintance
and
he
wants
to
go
off
with
her
now
for
a
special
licence
arthur
inglewood
walked
to
the
open
french
windows
and
looked
out
on
the
garden
still
golden
with
evening
light
nothing
moved
there
but
a
bird
or
two
hopping
and
twittering
but
beyond
the
hedge
and
railings
in
the
road
outside
the
garden
gate
a
hansom
cab
was
waiting
with
the
yellow
gladstone
bag
on
top
of
it
chapter
iv
the
garden
of
the
god
diana
duke
seemed
inexplicably
irritated
at
the
abrupt
entrance
and
utterance
of
the
other
girl
well
she
said
shortly
i
suppose
miss
gray
can
decline
him
if
she
does
want
to
marry
him
but
she
does
want
to
marry
him
cried
rosamund
in
exasperation
she
a
wild
wicked
fool
and
i
wo
be
parted
from
her
perhaps
said
diana
icily
but
i
really
do
see
what
we
can
do
but
the
man
balmy
diana
reasoned
her
friend
angrily
i
ca
let
my
nice
governess
marry
a
man
that
balmy
you
or
somebody
must
stop
it
mr
inglewood
you
a
man
go
and
tell
them
they
simply
ca
unfortunately
it
seems
to
me
they
simply
can
said
inglewood
with
a
depressed
air
i
have
far
less
right
of
intervention
than
miss
duke
besides
having
of
course
far
less
moral
force
than
she
you
have
either
of
you
got
much
cried
rosamund
the
last
stays
of
her
formidable
temper
giving
way
i
think
i
go
somewhere
else
for
a
little
sense
and
pluck
i
think
i
know
some
one
who
will
help
me
more
than
you
do
at
any
rate
he
a
cantankerous
beast
but
he
a
man
and
has
a
mind
and
knows
it
and
she
flung
out
into
the
garden
with
cheeks
aflame
and
the
parasol
whirling
like
a
catherine
wheel
she
found
michael
moon
standing
under
the
garden
tree
looking
over
the
hedge
hunched
like
a
bird
of
prey
with
his
large
pipe
hanging
down
his
long
blue
chin
the
very
hardness
of
his
expression
pleased
her
after
the
nonsense
of
the
new
engagement
and
the
of
her
other
friends
i
am
sorry
i
was
cross
mr
moon
she
said
frankly
i
hated
you
for
being
a
cynic
but
i
been
well
punished
for
i
want
a
cynic
just
now
i
had
my
fill
of
sentiment
i
fed
up
with
it
the
world
gone
mad
mr
moon
all
except
the
cynics
i
think
that
maniac
smith
wants
to
marry
my
old
friend
mary
and
she
and
she
does
seem
to
mind
seeing
his
attentive
face
still
undisturbedly
smoking
she
added
smartly
i
not
joking
that
smith
cab
outside
he
swears
take
her
off
now
to
his
aunt
and
go
for
a
special
licence
do
give
me
some
practical
advice
mr
moon
mr
moon
took
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
held
it
in
his
hand
for
an
instant
reflectively
and
then
tossed
it
to
the
other
side
of
the
garden
my
practical
advice
to
you
is
this
he
said
let
him
go
for
his
special
licence
and
ask
him
to
get
another
one
for
you
and
me
is
that
one
of
your
jokes
asked
the
young
lady
do
say
what
you
really
mean
i
mean
that
innocent
smith
is
a
man
of
business
said
moon
with
ponderous
precision
a
plain
practical
man
a
man
of
affairs
a
man
of
facts
and
the
daylight
he
has
let
down
twenty
ton
of
good
building
bricks
suddenly
on
my
head
and
i
am
glad
to
say
they
have
woken
me
up
we
went
to
sleep
a
little
while
ago
on
this
very
lawn
in
this
very
sunlight
we
have
had
a
little
nap
for
five
years
or
so
but
now
we
going
to
be
married
rosamund
and
i
ca
see
why
that
cab
really
said
rosamund
stoutly
i
do
know
what
you
mean
what
a
lie
cried
michael
advancing
on
her
with
brightening
eyes
i
all
for
lies
in
an
ordinary
way
but
do
you
see
that
they
wo
do
we
wandered
into
a
world
of
facts
old
girl
that
grass
growing
and
that
sun
going
down
and
that
cab
at
the
door
are
facts
you
used
to
torment
and
excuse
yourself
by
saying
i
was
after
your
money
and
did
really
love
you
but
if
i
stood
here
now
and
told
you
i
did
love
you
you
would
believe
me
for
truth
is
in
this
garden
really
mr
moon
said
rosamund
rather
more
faintly
he
kept
two
big
blue
magnetic
eyes
fixed
on
her
face
is
my
name
moon
he
asked
is
your
name
hunt
on
my
honour
they
sound
to
me
as
quaint
and
as
distant
as
red
indian
names
it
as
if
your
name
was
and
my
name
was
but
our
real
names
are
husband
and
wife
as
they
were
when
we
fell
asleep
it
is
no
good
said
rosamund
with
real
tears
in
her
eyes
one
can
never
go
back
i
can
go
where
i
damn
please
said
michael
and
i
can
carry
you
on
my
shoulder
but
really
michael
really
you
must
stop
and
think
cried
the
girl
earnestly
you
could
carry
me
off
my
feet
i
dare
say
soul
and
body
but
it
may
be
bitter
bad
business
for
all
that
these
things
done
in
that
romantic
rush
like
smith
they
they
do
attract
women
i
do
deny
it
as
you
say
we
all
telling
the
truth
they
attracted
poor
mary
for
one
they
attract
me
michael
but
the
cold
fact
remains
imprudent
marriages
do
lead
to
long
unhappiness
and
disappointment
you
got
used
to
your
drinks
and
things
i
sha
be
pretty
much
longer
imprudent
marriages
roared
michael
and
pray
where
in
earth
or
heaven
are
there
any
prudent
marriages
might
as
well
talk
about
prudent
suicides
you
and
i
have
dawdled
round
each
other
long
enough
and
are
we
any
safer
than
smith
and
mary
gray
who
met
last
night
you
never
know
a
husband
till
you
marry
him
unhappy
of
course
you
be
unhappy
who
the
devil
are
you
that
you
should
be
unhappy
like
the
mother
that
bore
you
disappointed
of
course
we
be
disappointed
i
for
one
do
expect
till
i
die
to
be
so
good
a
man
as
i
am
at
this
minute
a
tower
with
all
the
trumpets
shouting
you
see
all
this
said
rosamund
with
a
grand
sincerity
in
her
solid
face
and
do
you
really
want
to
marry
me
my
darling
what
else
is
there
to
do
reasoned
the
irishman
what
other
occupation
is
there
for
an
active
man
on
this
earth
except
to
marry
you
what
the
alternative
to
marriage
barring
sleep
it
not
liberty
rosamund
unless
you
marry
god
as
our
nuns
do
in
ireland
you
must
marry
man
that
is
me
the
only
third
thing
is
to
marry
yourself
yourself
yourself
yourself
the
only
companion
that
is
never
satisfied
and
never
satisfactory
michael
said
miss
hunt
in
a
very
soft
voice
if
you
wo
talk
so
much
i
marry
you
it
no
time
for
talking
cried
michael
moon
singing
is
the
only
thing
ca
you
find
that
mandoline
of
yours
rosamund
go
and
fetch
it
for
me
said
rosamund
with
crisp
and
sharp
authority
the
lounging
mr
moon
stood
for
one
split
second
astonished
then
he
shot
away
across
the
lawn
as
if
shod
with
the
feathered
shoes
out
of
the
greek
fairy
tale
he
cleared
three
yards
and
fifteen
daisies
at
a
leap
out
of
mere
bodily
levity
but
when
he
came
within
a
yard
or
two
of
the
open
parlour
windows
his
flying
feet
fell
in
their
old
manner
like
lead
he
twisted
round
and
came
back
slowly
whistling
the
events
of
that
enchanted
evening
were
not
at
an
end
inside
the
dark
of
which
moon
had
caught
a
glimpse
a
curious
thing
had
happened
almost
an
instant
after
the
intemperate
exit
of
rosamund
it
was
something
which
occurring
in
that
obscure
parlour
seemed
to
arthur
inglewood
like
heaven
and
earth
turning
head
over
heels
the
sea
being
the
ceiling
and
the
stars
the
floor
no
words
can
express
how
it
astonished
him
as
it
astonishes
all
simple
men
when
it
happens
yet
the
stiffest
female
stoicism
seems
separated
from
it
only
by
a
sheet
of
paper
or
a
sheet
of
steel
it
indicates
no
surrender
far
less
any
sympathy
the
most
rigid
and
ruthless
woman
can
begin
to
cry
just
as
the
most
effeminate
man
can
grow
a
beard
it
is
a
separate
sexual
power
and
proves
nothing
one
way
or
the
other
about
force
of
character
but
to
young
men
ignorant
of
women
like
arthur
inglewood
to
see
diana
duke
crying
was
like
seeing
a
shedding
tears
of
petrol
he
could
never
have
given
even
if
his
really
manly
modesty
had
permitted
it
any
vaguest
vision
of
what
he
did
when
he
saw
that
portent
he
acted
as
men
do
when
a
theatre
catches
fire
very
differently
from
how
they
would
have
conceived
themselves
as
acting
whether
for
better
or
worse
he
had
a
faint
memory
of
certain
explanations
that
the
heiress
was
the
one
really
paying
guest
and
she
would
go
and
the
bailiffs
in
consequence
would
come
but
after
that
he
knew
nothing
of
his
own
conduct
except
by
the
protests
it
evoked
leave
me
alone
inglewood
leave
me
alone
that
not
the
way
to
help
but
i
can
help
you
said
arthur
with
grinding
certainty
i
can
i
can
i
can
why
you
said
cried
the
girl
that
you
were
much
weaker
than
me
so
i
am
weaker
than
you
said
arthur
in
a
voice
that
went
vibrating
through
everything
but
not
just
now
let
go
my
hands
cried
diana
i
wo
be
bullied
in
one
element
he
was
much
stronger
than
she
the
matter
of
humour
this
leapt
up
in
him
suddenly
and
he
laughed
saying
well
you
are
mean
you
know
quite
well
you
bully
me
all
the
rest
of
my
life
you
might
allow
a
man
the
one
minute
of
his
life
when
he
allowed
to
bully
it
was
as
extraordinary
for
him
to
laugh
as
for
her
to
cry
and
for
the
first
time
since
her
childhood
diana
was
entirely
off
her
guard
do
you
mean
you
want
to
marry
me
she
said
why
there
a
cab
at
the
door
cried
inglewood
springing
up
with
an
unconscious
energy
and
bursting
open
the
glass
doors
that
led
into
the
garden
as
he
led
her
out
by
the
hand
they
realized
somehow
for
the
first
time
that
the
house
and
garden
were
on
a
steep
height
over
london
and
yet
though
they
felt
the
place
to
be
uplifted
they
felt
it
also
to
be
secret
it
was
like
some
round
walled
garden
on
the
top
of
one
of
the
turrets
of
heaven
inglewood
looked
around
dreamily
his
brown
eyes
devouring
all
sorts
of
details
with
a
senseless
delight
he
noticed
for
the
first
time
that
the
railings
of
the
gate
beyond
the
garden
bushes
were
moulded
like
little
spearheads
and
painted
blue
he
noticed
that
one
of
the
blue
spears
was
loosened
in
its
place
and
hung
sideways
and
this
almost
made
him
laugh
he
thought
it
somehow
exquisitely
harmless
and
funny
that
the
railing
should
be
crooked
he
thought
he
should
like
to
know
how
it
happened
who
did
it
and
how
the
man
was
getting
on
when
they
were
gone
a
few
feet
across
that
fiery
grass
they
realized
that
they
were
not
alone
rosamund
hunt
and
the
eccentric
mr
moon
both
of
whom
they
had
last
seen
in
the
blackest
temper
of
detachment
were
standing
together
on
the
lawn
they
were
standing
in
quite
an
ordinary
manner
and
yet
they
looked
somehow
like
people
in
a
book
oh
said
diana
what
lovely
air
i
know
called
out
rosamund
with
a
pleasure
so
positive
that
it
rang
out
like
a
complaint
it
just
like
that
horrid
beastly
fizzy
stuff
they
gave
me
that
made
me
feel
happy
oh
it
is
like
anything
but
itself
answered
diana
breathing
deeply
why
it
all
cold
and
yet
it
feels
like
fire
balmy
is
the
word
we
use
in
fleet
street
said
mr
moon
balmy
especially
on
the
crumpet
and
he
fanned
himself
quite
unnecessarily
with
his
straw
hat
they
were
all
full
of
little
leaps
and
pulsations
of
objectless
and
airy
energy
diana
stirred
and
stretched
her
long
arms
rigidly
as
if
crucified
in
a
sort
of
excruciating
restfulness
michael
stood
still
for
long
intervals
with
gathered
muscles
then
spun
round
like
a
teetotum
and
stood
still
again
rosamund
did
not
trip
for
women
never
trip
except
when
they
fall
on
their
noses
but
she
struck
the
ground
with
her
foot
as
she
moved
as
if
to
some
inaudible
dance
tune
and
inglewood
leaning
quite
quietly
against
a
tree
had
unconsciously
clutched
a
branch
and
shaken
it
with
a
creative
violence
those
giant
gestures
of
man
that
made
the
high
statues
and
the
strokes
of
war
tossed
and
tormented
all
their
limbs
silently
as
they
strolled
and
stood
they
were
bursting
like
batteries
with
an
animal
magnetism
and
now
cried
moon
quite
suddenly
stretching
out
a
hand
on
each
side
let
dance
round
that
bush
why
what
bush
do
you
mean
asked
rosamund
looking
round
with
a
sort
of
radiant
rudeness
the
bush
that
is
there
said
michael
the
mulberry
bush
they
had
taken
each
other
hands
half
laughing
and
quite
ritually
and
before
they
could
disconnect
again
michael
spun
them
all
round
like
a
demon
spinning
the
world
for
a
top
diana
felt
as
the
circle
of
the
horizon
flew
instantaneously
around
her
a
far
aerial
sense
of
the
ring
of
heights
beyond
london
and
corners
where
she
had
climbed
as
a
child
she
seemed
almost
to
hear
the
rooks
cawing
about
the
old
pines
on
highgate
or
to
see
the
glowworms
gathering
and
kindling
in
the
woods
of
box
hill
the
circle
broke
as
all
such
perfect
circles
of
levity
must
break
and
sent
its
author
michael
flying
as
by
centrifugal
force
far
away
against
the
blue
rails
of
the
gate
when
reeling
there
he
suddenly
raised
shout
after
shout
of
a
new
and
quite
dramatic
character
why
it
warner
he
shouted
waving
his
arms
it
jolly
old
warner
with
a
new
silk
hat
and
the
old
silk
moustache
is
that
dr
warner
cried
rosamund
bounding
forward
in
a
burst
of
memory
amusement
and
distress
oh
i
so
sorry
oh
do
tell
him
it
all
right
let
take
hands
and
tell
him
said
michael
moon
for
indeed
while
they
were
talking
another
hansom
cab
had
dashed
up
behind
the
one
already
waiting
and
herbert
warner
leaving
a
companion
in
the
cab
had
carefully
deposited
himself
on
the
pavement
now
when
you
are
an
eminent
physician
and
are
wired
for
by
an
heiress
to
come
to
a
case
of
dangerous
mania
and
when
as
you
come
in
through
the
garden
to
the
house
the
heiress
and
her
landlady
and
two
of
the
gentlemen
boarders
join
hands
and
dance
round
you
in
a
ring
calling
out
it
all
right
all
right
you
are
apt
to
be
flustered
and
even
displeased
warner
was
a
placid
but
hardly
a
placable
person
the
two
things
are
by
no
means
the
same
and
even
when
moon
explained
to
him
that
he
warner
with
his
high
hat
and
tall
solid
figure
was
just
such
a
classic
figure
as
ought
to
be
danced
round
by
a
ring
of
laughing
maidens
on
some
old
golden
greek
seashore
even
then
he
seemed
to
miss
the
point
of
the
general
rejoicing
inglewood
cried
warner
fixing
his
former
disciple
with
a
stare
are
you
mad
arthur
flushed
to
the
roots
of
his
brown
hair
but
he
answered
easily
and
quietly
enough
not
now
the
truth
is
warner
i
just
made
a
rather
important
medical
discovery
quite
in
your
line
what
do
you
mean
asked
the
great
doctor
stiffly
what
discovery
i
discovered
that
health
really
is
catching
like
disease
answered
arthur
yes
sanity
has
broken
out
and
is
spreading
said
michael
performing
a
with
a
thoughtful
expression
twenty
thousand
more
cases
taken
to
the
hospitals
nurses
employed
night
and
day
warner
studied
michael
grave
face
and
lightly
moving
legs
with
an
unfathomed
wonder
and
is
this
may
i
ask
he
said
the
sanity
that
is
spreading
you
must
forgive
me
warner
cried
rosamund
hunt
heartily
i
know
i
treated
you
badly
but
indeed
it
was
all
a
mistake
i
was
in
a
frightfully
bad
temper
when
i
sent
for
you
but
now
it
all
seems
like
a
dream
and
and
smith
is
the
sweetest
most
sensible
most
delightful
old
thing
that
ever
existed
and
he
may
marry
any
one
he
likes
except
me
i
should
suggest
duke
said
michael
the
gravity
of
warner
face
increased
he
took
a
slip
of
pink
paper
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
with
his
pale
blue
eyes
quietly
fixed
on
rosamund
face
all
the
time
he
spoke
with
a
not
inexcusable
frigidity
really
miss
hunt
he
said
you
are
not
yet
very
reassuring
you
sent
me
this
wire
only
half
an
hour
ago
at
once
if
possible
with
another
doctor
man
innocent
smith
gone
mad
on
premises
and
doing
dreadful
things
do
you
know
anything
of
him
i
went
round
at
once
to
a
distinguished
colleague
of
mine
a
doctor
who
is
also
a
private
detective
and
an
authority
on
criminal
lunacy
he
has
come
round
with
me
and
is
waiting
in
the
cab
now
you
calmly
tell
me
that
this
criminal
madman
is
a
highly
sweet
and
sane
old
thing
with
accompaniments
that
set
me
speculating
on
your
own
definition
of
sanity
i
hardly
comprehend
the
change
oh
how
can
one
explain
a
change
in
sun
and
moon
and
everybody
soul
cried
rosamund
in
despair
must
i
confess
we
had
got
so
morbid
as
to
think
him
mad
merely
because
he
wanted
to
get
married
and
that
we
did
even
know
it
was
only
because
we
wanted
to
get
married
ourselves
we
humiliate
ourselves
if
you
like
doctor
we
happy
enough
where
is
mr
smith
asked
warner
of
inglewood
very
sharply
arthur
started
he
had
forgotten
all
about
the
central
figure
of
their
farce
who
had
not
been
visible
for
an
hour
or
more
i
i
think
he
on
the
other
side
of
the
house
by
the
dustbin
he
said
he
may
be
on
the
road
to
russia
said
warner
but
he
must
be
found
and
he
strode
away
and
disappeared
round
a
corner
of
the
house
by
the
sunflowers
i
hope
said
rosamund
he
wo
really
interfere
with
mr
smith
interfere
with
the
daisies
said
michael
with
a
snort
a
man
ca
be
locked
up
for
falling
in
love
at
least
i
hope
not
no
i
think
even
a
doctor
could
make
a
disease
out
of
him
he
throw
off
the
doctor
like
the
disease
do
you
know
i
believe
it
a
case
of
a
sort
of
holy
well
i
believe
innocent
smith
is
simply
innocent
and
that
is
why
he
is
so
extraordinary
it
was
rosamund
who
spoke
restlessly
tracing
circles
in
the
grass
with
the
point
of
her
white
shoe
i
think
said
inglewood
that
smith
is
not
extraordinary
at
all
he
comic
just
because
he
so
startlingly
commonplace
do
you
know
what
it
is
to
be
all
one
family
circle
with
aunts
and
uncles
when
a
schoolboy
comes
home
for
the
holidays
that
bag
there
on
the
cab
is
only
a
schoolboy
hamper
this
tree
here
in
the
garden
is
only
the
sort
of
tree
that
any
schoolboy
would
have
climbed
yes
that
the
thing
that
has
haunted
us
all
about
him
the
thing
we
could
never
fit
a
word
to
whether
he
is
my
old
schoolfellow
or
no
at
least
he
is
all
my
old
schoolfellows
he
is
the
endless
animal
that
we
have
all
been
that
is
only
you
absurd
boys
said
diana
i
do
believe
any
girl
was
ever
so
silly
and
i
sure
no
girl
was
ever
so
happy
except
and
she
stopped
i
will
tell
you
the
truth
about
innocent
smith
said
michael
moon
in
a
low
voice
warner
has
gone
to
look
for
him
in
vain
he
is
not
there
have
you
noticed
that
we
never
saw
him
since
we
found
ourselves
he
was
an
astral
baby
born
on
all
four
of
us
he
was
only
our
own
youth
returned
long
before
poor
old
warner
had
clambered
out
of
his
cab
the
thing
we
called
smith
had
dissolved
into
dew
and
light
on
this
lawn
once
or
twice
more
by
the
mercy
of
god
we
may
feel
the
thing
but
the
man
we
shall
never
see
in
a
spring
garden
before
breakfast
we
shall
smell
the
smell
called
smith
in
the
snapping
of
brisk
twigs
in
tiny
fires
we
shall
hear
a
noise
named
smith
everything
insatiable
and
innocent
in
the
grasses
that
gobble
up
the
earth
like
babies
at
a
bun
feast
in
the
white
mornings
that
split
the
sky
as
a
boy
splits
up
white
firwood
we
may
feel
for
one
instant
the
presence
of
an
impetuous
purity
but
his
innocence
was
too
close
to
the
unconsciousness
of
inanimate
things
not
to
melt
back
at
a
mere
touch
into
the
mild
hedges
and
heavens
he
he
was
interrupted
from
behind
the
house
by
a
bang
like
that
of
a
bomb
almost
at
the
same
instant
the
stranger
in
the
cab
sprang
out
of
it
leaving
it
rocking
upon
the
stones
of
the
road
he
clutched
the
blue
railings
of
the
garden
and
peered
eagerly
over
them
in
the
direction
of
the
noise
he
was
a
small
loose
yet
alert
man
very
thin
with
a
face
that
seemed
made
out
of
fish
bones
and
a
silk
hat
quite
as
rigid
and
resplendent
as
warner
but
thrust
back
recklessly
on
the
hinder
part
of
his
head
murder
he
shrieked
in
a
high
and
feminine
but
very
penetrating
voice
stop
that
murderer
there
even
as
he
shrieked
a
second
shot
shook
the
lower
windows
of
the
house
and
with
the
noise
of
it
herbert
warner
came
flying
round
the
corner
like
a
leaping
rabbit
yet
before
he
had
reached
the
group
a
third
discharge
had
deafened
them
and
they
saw
with
their
own
eyes
two
spots
of
white
sky
drilled
through
the
second
of
the
unhappy
herbert
high
hats
the
next
moment
the
fugitive
physician
fell
over
a
flowerpot
and
came
down
on
all
fours
staring
like
a
cow
the
hat
with
the
two
in
it
rolled
upon
the
gravel
path
before
him
and
innocent
smith
came
round
the
corner
like
a
railway
train
he
was
looking
twice
his
proper
size
a
giant
clad
in
green
the
big
revolver
still
smoking
in
his
hand
his
face
sanguine
and
in
shadow
his
eyes
blazing
like
all
stars
and
his
yellow
hair
standing
out
all
ways
like
struwelpeter
though
this
startling
scene
hung
but
an
instant
in
stillness
inglewood
had
time
to
feel
once
more
what
he
had
felt
when
he
saw
the
other
lovers
standing
on
the
lawn
the
sensation
of
a
certain
cut
and
coloured
clearness
that
belongs
rather
to
the
things
of
art
than
to
the
things
of
experience
the
broken
flowerpot
with
its
geraniums
the
green
bulk
of
smith
and
the
black
bulk
of
warner
the
railings
behind
clutched
by
the
stranger
yellow
vulture
claws
and
peered
over
by
his
long
vulture
neck
the
silk
hat
on
the
gravel
and
the
little
cloudlet
of
smoke
floating
across
the
garden
as
innocently
as
the
puff
of
a
cigarette
all
these
seemed
unnaturally
distinct
and
definite
they
existed
like
symbols
in
an
ecstasy
of
separation
indeed
every
object
grew
more
and
more
particular
and
precious
because
the
whole
picture
was
breaking
up
things
look
so
bright
just
before
they
burst
long
before
his
fancies
had
begun
let
alone
ceased
arthur
had
stepped
across
and
taken
one
of
smith
arms
simultaneously
the
little
stranger
had
run
up
the
steps
and
taken
the
other
smith
went
into
peals
of
laughter
and
surrendered
his
pistol
with
perfect
willingness
moon
raised
the
doctor
to
his
feet
and
then
went
and
leaned
sullenly
on
the
garden
gate
the
girls
were
quiet
and
vigilant
as
good
women
mostly
are
in
instants
of
catastrophe
but
their
faces
showed
that
somehow
or
other
a
light
had
been
dashed
out
of
the
sky
the
doctor
himself
when
he
had
risen
collected
his
hat
and
wits
and
dusting
himself
down
with
an
air
of
great
disgust
turned
to
them
in
brief
apology
he
was
very
white
with
his
recent
panic
but
he
spoke
with
perfect
you
will
excuse
us
ladies
he
said
my
friend
and
inglewood
are
both
scientists
in
their
several
ways
i
think
we
had
better
all
take
smith
indoors
and
communicate
with
you
later
and
under
the
guard
of
the
three
natural
philosophers
the
disarmed
smith
was
led
tactfully
into
the
house
still
roaring
with
laughter
from
time
to
time
during
the
next
twenty
minutes
his
distant
boom
of
mirth
could
again
be
heard
through
the
window
but
there
came
no
echo
of
the
quiet
voices
of
the
physicians
the
girls
walked
about
the
garden
together
rubbing
up
each
spirits
as
best
they
might
michael
moon
still
hung
heavily
against
the
gate
somewhere
about
the
expiration
of
that
time
warner
came
out
of
the
house
with
a
face
less
pale
but
even
more
stern
and
the
little
man
with
the
face
advanced
gravely
in
his
rear
and
if
the
face
of
warner
in
the
sunlight
was
that
of
a
hanging
judge
the
face
of
the
little
man
behind
was
more
like
a
death
head
miss
hunt
said
herbert
warner
i
only
wish
to
offer
you
my
warm
thanks
and
admiration
by
your
prompt
courage
and
wisdom
in
sending
for
us
by
wire
this
evening
you
have
enabled
us
to
capture
and
put
out
of
mischief
one
of
the
most
cruel
and
terrible
of
the
enemies
of
humanity
a
criminal
whose
plausibility
and
pitilessness
have
never
been
before
combined
in
flesh
rosamund
looked
across
at
him
with
a
white
blank
face
and
blinking
eyes
what
do
you
mean
she
asked
you
ca
mean
mr
smith
he
has
gone
by
many
other
names
said
the
doctor
gravely
and
not
one
he
did
not
leave
to
be
cursed
behind
him
that
man
miss
hunt
has
left
a
track
of
blood
and
tears
across
the
world
whether
he
is
mad
as
well
as
wicked
we
are
trying
in
the
interests
of
science
to
discover
in
any
case
we
shall
have
to
take
him
to
a
magistrate
first
even
if
only
on
the
road
to
a
lunatic
asylum
but
the
lunatic
asylum
in
which
he
is
confined
will
have
to
be
sealed
with
wall
within
wall
and
ringed
with
guns
like
a
fortress
or
he
will
break
out
again
to
bring
forth
carnage
and
darkness
on
the
earth
rosamund
looked
at
the
two
doctors
her
face
growing
paler
and
paler
then
her
eyes
strayed
to
michael
who
was
leaning
on
the
gate
but
he
continued
to
lean
on
it
without
moving
with
his
face
turned
away
towards
the
darkening
road
chapter
v
the
allegorical
practical
joker
the
criminal
specialist
who
had
come
with
warner
was
a
somewhat
more
urbane
and
even
dapper
figure
than
he
had
appeared
when
clutching
the
railings
and
craning
his
neck
into
the
garden
he
even
looked
comparatively
young
when
he
took
his
hat
off
having
fair
hair
parted
in
the
middle
and
carefully
curled
on
each
side
and
lively
movements
especially
of
the
hands
he
had
a
dandified
monocle
slung
round
his
neck
by
a
broad
black
ribbon
and
a
big
bow
tie
as
if
a
big
american
moth
had
alighted
on
him
his
dress
and
gestures
were
bright
enough
for
a
boy
it
was
only
when
you
looked
at
the
face
that
you
beheld
something
acrid
and
old
his
manners
were
excellent
though
hardly
english
and
he
had
two
tricks
by
which
people
who
only
met
him
once
remembered
him
one
was
a
trick
of
closing
his
eyes
when
he
wished
to
be
particularly
polite
the
other
was
one
of
lifting
his
joined
thumb
and
forefinger
in
the
air
as
if
holding
a
pinch
of
snuff
when
he
was
hesitating
or
hovering
over
a
word
but
those
who
were
longer
in
his
company
tended
to
forget
these
oddities
in
the
stream
of
his
quaint
and
solemn
conversation
and
really
singular
views
miss
hunt
said
warner
this
is
cyrus
pym
cyrus
pym
shut
his
eyes
during
the
introduction
rather
as
if
he
were
playing
fair
in
some
child
game
and
gave
a
prompt
little
bow
which
somehow
suddenly
revealed
him
as
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
cyrus
pym
continued
warner
pym
shut
his
eyes
again
is
perhaps
the
first
criminological
expert
of
america
we
are
very
fortunate
to
be
able
to
consult
with
him
in
this
extraordinary
case
i
ca
make
head
or
tail
of
anything
said
rosamund
how
can
poor
smith
be
so
dreadful
as
he
is
by
your
account
or
by
your
telegram
said
herbert
warner
smiling
oh
you
do
understand
cried
the
girl
impatiently
why
he
done
us
all
more
good
than
going
to
church
i
think
i
can
explain
to
the
young
lady
said
cyrus
pym
this
criminal
or
maniac
smith
is
a
very
genius
of
evil
and
has
a
method
of
his
own
a
method
of
the
most
daring
ingenuity
he
is
popular
wherever
he
goes
for
he
invades
every
house
as
an
uproarious
child
people
are
getting
suspicious
of
all
the
respectable
disguises
for
a
scoundrel
so
he
always
uses
the
disguise
of
what
shall
i
say
the
bohemian
the
blameless
bohemian
he
always
carries
people
off
their
feet
people
are
used
to
the
mask
of
conventional
good
conduct
he
goes
in
for
eccentric
you
expect
a
don
juan
to
dress
up
as
a
solemn
and
solid
spanish
merchant
but
you
not
prepared
when
he
dresses
up
as
don
quixote
you
expect
a
humbug
to
behave
like
sir
charles
grandison
because
with
all
respect
miss
hunt
for
the
deep
tenderness
of
samuel
richardson
sir
charles
grandison
so
often
behaved
like
a
humbug
but
no
real
citizen
is
quite
ready
for
a
humbug
that
models
himself
not
on
sir
charles
grandison
but
on
sir
roger
de
coverly
setting
up
to
be
a
good
man
a
little
cracked
is
a
new
criminal
incognito
miss
hunt
it
been
a
great
notion
and
uncommonly
successful
but
its
success
just
makes
it
mighty
cruel
i
can
forgive
dick
turpin
if
he
impersonates
busby
i
ca
forgive
him
when
he
impersonates
johnson
the
saint
with
a
tile
loose
is
a
bit
too
sacred
i
guess
to
be
parodied
but
how
do
you
know
cried
rosamund
desperately
that
smith
is
a
known
criminal
i
collated
all
the
documents
said
the
american
when
my
friend
warner
knocked
me
up
on
receipt
of
your
cable
it
is
my
professional
affair
to
know
these
facts
miss
hunt
and
there
no
more
doubt
about
them
than
about
the
bradshaw
down
at
the
depot
this
man
has
hitherto
escaped
the
law
through
his
admirable
affectations
of
infancy
or
insanity
but
i
myself
as
a
specialist
have
privately
authenticated
notes
of
some
eighteen
or
twenty
crimes
attempted
or
achieved
in
this
manner
he
comes
to
houses
as
he
has
to
this
and
gets
a
grand
popularity
he
makes
things
go
they
do
go
when
he
gone
the
things
are
gone
gone
miss
hunt
gone
a
man
life
or
a
man
spoons
or
more
often
a
woman
i
assure
you
i
have
all
the
memoranda
i
have
seen
them
said
warner
solidly
i
can
assure
you
that
all
this
is
correct
the
most
unmanly
aspect
according
to
my
feelings
went
on
the
american
doctor
is
this
perpetual
deception
of
innocent
women
by
a
wild
simulation
of
innocence
from
almost
every
house
where
this
great
imaginative
devil
has
been
he
has
taken
some
poor
girl
away
with
him
some
say
he
got
a
hypnotic
eye
with
his
other
queer
features
and
that
they
go
like
automata
what
become
of
all
those
poor
girls
nobody
knows
murdered
i
dare
say
for
we
lots
of
instances
besides
this
one
of
his
turning
his
hand
to
murder
though
none
ever
brought
him
under
the
law
anyhow
our
most
modern
methods
of
research
ca
find
any
trace
of
the
wretched
women
it
when
i
think
of
them
that
i
am
really
moved
miss
hunt
and
really
nothing
else
to
say
just
now
except
what
warner
has
said
quite
so
said
warner
with
a
smile
that
seemed
moulded
in
marble
that
we
all
have
to
thank
you
very
much
for
that
telegram
the
little
yankee
scientist
had
been
speaking
with
such
evident
sincerity
that
one
forgot
the
tricks
of
his
voice
and
manner
the
falling
eyelids
the
rising
intonation
and
the
poised
finger
and
thumb
which
were
at
other
times
a
little
comic
it
was
not
so
much
that
he
was
cleverer
than
warner
perhaps
he
was
not
so
clever
though
he
was
more
celebrated
but
he
had
what
warner
never
had
a
fresh
and
unaffected
seriousness
the
great
american
virtue
of
simplicity
rosamund
knitted
her
brows
and
looked
gloomily
toward
the
darkening
house
that
contained
the
dark
prodigy
broad
daylight
still
endured
but
it
had
already
changed
from
gold
to
silver
and
was
changing
from
silver
to
gray
the
long
plumy
shadows
of
the
one
or
two
trees
in
the
garden
faded
more
and
more
upon
a
dead
background
of
dusk
in
the
sharpest
and
deepest
shadow
which
was
the
entrance
to
the
house
by
the
big
french
windows
rosamund
could
watch
a
hurried
consultation
between
inglewood
who
was
still
left
in
charge
of
the
mysterious
captive
and
diana
who
had
moved
to
his
assistance
from
without
after
a
few
minutes
and
gestures
they
went
inside
shutting
the
glass
doors
upon
the
garden
and
the
garden
seemed
to
grow
grayer
still
the
american
gentleman
named
pym
seemed
to
be
turning
and
on
the
move
in
the
same
direction
but
before
he
started
he
spoke
to
rosamund
with
a
flash
of
that
guileless
tact
which
redeemed
much
of
his
childish
vanity
and
with
something
of
that
spontaneous
poetry
which
made
it
difficult
pedantic
as
he
was
to
call
him
a
pedant
i
vurry
sorry
miss
hunt
he
said
but
warner
and
i
as
two
practitioners
had
better
take
smith
away
in
that
cab
and
the
less
said
about
it
the
better
do
you
agitate
yourself
miss
hunt
you
just
got
to
think
that
we
taking
away
a
monstrosity
something
that
ought
to
be
at
all
something
like
one
of
those
gods
in
your
britannic
museum
all
wings
and
beards
and
legs
and
eyes
and
no
shape
that
what
smith
is
and
you
shall
soon
be
quit
of
him
he
had
already
taken
a
step
towards
the
house
and
warner
was
about
to
follow
him
when
the
glass
doors
were
opened
again
and
diana
duke
came
out
with
more
than
her
usual
quickness
across
the
lawn
her
face
was
aquiver
with
worry
and
excitement
and
her
dark
earnest
eyes
fixed
only
on
the
other
girl
rosamund
she
cried
in
despair
what
shall
i
do
with
her
with
her
cried
miss
hunt
with
a
violent
jump
o
lord
he
is
a
woman
too
is
he
no
no
no
said
pym
soothingly
as
if
in
common
fairness
a
woman
no
really
he
is
not
so
bad
as
that
i
mean
your
friend
mary
gray
retorted
diana
with
equal
tartness
what
on
earth
am
i
to
do
with
her
how
can
we
tell
her
about
smith
you
mean
answered
rosamund
her
face
at
once
clouded
and
softening
yes
it
will
be
pretty
painful
but
i
have
told
her
exploded
diana
with
more
than
her
congenital
exasperation
i
have
told
her
and
she
does
seem
to
mind
she
still
says
she
going
away
with
smith
in
that
cab
but
it
impossible
ejaculated
rosamund
why
mary
is
really
religious
she
she
stopped
in
time
to
realize
that
mary
gray
was
comparatively
close
to
her
on
the
lawn
her
quiet
companion
had
come
down
very
quietly
into
the
garden
but
dressed
very
decisively
for
travel
she
had
a
neat
but
very
ancient
blue
on
her
head
and
was
pulling
some
rather
threadbare
gray
gloves
on
to
her
hands
yet
the
two
tints
fitted
excellently
with
her
heavy
hair
the
more
excellently
for
the
touch
of
shabbiness
for
a
woman
clothes
never
suit
her
so
well
as
when
they
seem
to
suit
her
by
accident
but
in
this
case
the
woman
had
a
quality
yet
more
unique
and
attractive
in
such
gray
hours
when
the
sun
is
sunk
and
the
skies
are
already
sad
it
will
often
happen
that
one
reflection
at
some
occasional
angle
will
cause
to
linger
the
last
of
the
light
a
scrap
of
window
a
scrap
of
water
a
scrap
of
will
be
full
of
the
fire
that
is
lost
to
all
the
rest
of
the
earth
the
quaint
almost
triangular
face
of
mary
gray
was
like
some
triangular
piece
of
mirror
that
could
still
repeat
the
splendour
of
hours
before
mary
though
she
was
always
graceful
could
never
before
have
properly
been
called
beautiful
and
yet
her
happiness
amid
all
that
misery
was
so
beautiful
as
to
make
a
man
catch
his
breath
o
diana
cried
rosamund
in
a
lower
voice
and
altering
her
phrase
but
how
did
you
tell
her
it
is
quite
easy
to
tell
her
answered
diana
sombrely
it
makes
no
impression
at
all
i
afraid
i
kept
everything
waiting
said
mary
gray
apologetically
and
now
we
must
really
say
innocent
is
taking
me
to
his
over
at
hampstead
and
i
afraid
she
goes
to
bed
early
her
words
were
quite
casual
and
practical
but
there
was
a
sort
of
sleepy
light
in
her
eyes
that
was
more
baffling
than
darkness
she
was
like
one
speaking
absently
with
her
eye
on
some
very
distant
object
mary
mary
cried
rosamund
almost
breaking
down
i
so
sorry
about
it
but
the
thing
ca
be
at
all
we
we
have
found
out
all
about
mr
smith
all
repeated
mary
with
a
low
and
curious
intonation
why
that
must
be
awfully
exciting
there
was
no
noise
for
an
instant
and
no
motion
except
that
the
silent
michael
moon
leaning
on
the
gate
lifted
his
head
as
it
might
be
to
listen
then
rosamund
remaining
speechless
pym
came
to
her
rescue
in
a
definite
way
to
begin
with
he
said
this
man
smith
is
constantly
attempting
murder
the
warden
of
brakespeare
college
i
know
said
mary
with
a
vague
but
radiant
smile
innocent
told
me
i
ca
say
what
he
told
you
replied
pym
quickly
but
i
very
much
afraid
it
was
true
the
plain
truth
is
that
the
man
stained
with
every
known
human
crime
i
assure
you
i
have
all
the
documents
i
have
evidence
of
his
committing
burglary
signed
by
a
most
eminent
english
curate
i
have
oh
but
there
were
two
curates
cried
mary
with
a
certain
gentle
eagerness
that
was
what
made
it
so
much
funnier
the
darkened
glass
doors
of
the
house
opened
once
more
and
inglewood
appeared
for
an
instant
making
a
sort
of
signal
the
american
doctor
bowed
the
english
doctor
did
not
but
they
both
set
out
stolidly
towards
the
house
no
one
else
moved
not
even
michael
hanging
on
the
gate
but
the
back
of
his
head
and
shoulders
had
still
an
indescribable
indication
that
he
was
listening
to
every
word
but
do
you
understand
mary
cried
rosamund
in
despair
do
you
know
that
awful
things
have
happened
even
before
our
very
eyes
i
should
have
thought
you
would
have
heard
the
revolver
shots
upstairs
yes
i
heard
the
shots
said
mary
almost
brightly
but
i
was
busy
packing
just
then
and
innocent
had
told
me
he
was
going
to
shoot
at
warner
so
it
was
worth
while
to
come
down
oh
i
do
understand
what
you
mean
cried
rosamund
hunt
stamping
but
you
must
and
shall
understand
what
i
mean
i
do
care
how
cruelly
i
put
it
if
only
i
can
save
you
i
mean
that
your
innocent
smith
is
the
most
awfully
wicked
man
in
the
world
he
has
sent
bullets
at
lots
of
other
men
and
gone
off
in
cabs
with
lots
of
other
women
and
he
seems
to
have
killed
the
women
too
for
nobody
can
find
them
he
is
really
rather
naughty
sometimes
said
mary
gray
laughing
softly
as
she
buttoned
her
old
gray
gloves
oh
this
is
really
mesmerism
or
something
said
rosamund
and
burst
into
tears
at
the
same
moment
the
two
doctors
appeared
out
of
the
house
with
their
great
captive
between
them
he
made
no
resistance
but
was
still
laughing
in
a
groggy
and
style
arthur
inglewood
followed
in
the
rear
a
dark
and
red
study
in
the
last
shades
of
distress
and
shame
in
this
black
funereal
and
painfully
realistic
style
the
exit
from
beacon
house
was
made
by
a
man
whose
entrance
a
day
before
had
been
effected
by
the
happy
leaping
of
a
wall
and
the
hilarious
climbing
of
a
tree
no
one
moved
of
the
groups
in
the
garden
except
mary
gray
who
stepped
forward
quite
naturally
calling
out
are
you
ready
innocent
our
cab
been
waiting
such
a
long
time
ladies
and
gentlemen
said
warner
firmly
i
must
insist
on
asking
this
lady
to
stand
aside
we
shall
have
trouble
enough
as
it
is
with
the
three
of
us
in
a
cab
but
it
is
our
cab
persisted
mary
why
there
innocent
yellow
bag
on
the
top
of
it
stand
aside
repeated
warner
roughly
and
you
mr
moon
please
be
so
obliging
as
to
move
a
moment
come
come
the
sooner
this
ugly
business
is
over
the
better
and
how
can
we
open
the
gate
if
you
will
keep
leaning
on
it
michael
moon
looked
at
his
long
lean
forefinger
and
seemed
to
consider
and
reconsider
this
argument
yes
he
said
at
last
but
how
can
i
lean
on
this
gate
if
you
keep
on
opening
it
oh
get
out
of
the
way
cried
warner
almost
you
can
lean
on
the
gate
any
time
no
said
moon
reflectively
seldom
the
time
and
the
place
and
the
blue
gate
altogether
and
it
all
depends
whether
you
come
of
an
old
country
family
my
ancestors
leaned
on
gates
before
any
one
had
discovered
how
to
open
them
michael
cried
arthur
inglewood
in
a
kind
of
agony
are
you
going
to
get
out
of
the
way
why
no
i
think
not
said
michael
after
some
meditation
and
swung
himself
slowly
round
so
that
he
confronted
the
company
while
still
in
a
lounging
attitude
occupying
the
path
hullo
he
called
out
suddenly
what
are
you
doing
to
mr
smith
taking
him
away
answered
warner
shortly
to
be
examined
matriculation
asked
moon
brightly
by
a
magistrate
said
the
other
curtly
and
what
other
magistrate
cried
michael
raising
his
voice
dares
to
try
what
befell
on
this
free
soil
save
only
the
ancient
and
independent
dukes
of
beacon
what
other
court
dares
to
try
one
of
our
company
save
only
the
high
court
of
beacon
have
you
forgotten
that
only
this
afternoon
we
flew
the
flag
of
independence
and
severed
ourselves
from
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
michael
cried
rosamund
wringing
her
hands
how
can
you
stand
there
talking
nonsense
why
you
saw
the
dreadful
thing
yourself
you
were
there
when
he
went
mad
it
was
you
that
helped
the
doctor
up
when
he
fell
over
the
and
the
high
court
of
beacon
replied
moon
with
hauteur
has
special
powers
in
all
cases
concerning
lunatics
and
doctors
who
fall
down
in
gardens
it
in
our
very
first
charter
from
edward
i
medicus
quisquam
in
horto
prostratus
out
of
the
way
cried
warner
with
sudden
fury
or
we
will
force
you
out
of
it
what
cried
michael
moon
with
a
cry
of
hilarious
fierceness
shall
i
die
in
defence
of
this
sacred
pale
will
you
paint
these
blue
railings
red
with
my
gore
and
he
laid
hold
of
one
of
the
blue
spikes
behind
him
as
inglewood
had
noticed
earlier
in
the
evening
the
railing
was
loose
and
crooked
at
this
place
and
the
painted
iron
staff
and
spearhead
came
away
in
hand
as
he
shook
it
see
he
cried
brandishing
this
broken
javelin
in
the
air
the
very
lances
round
beacon
tower
leap
from
their
places
to
defend
it
ah
in
such
a
place
and
hour
it
is
a
fine
thing
to
die
alone
and
in
a
voice
like
a
drum
he
rolled
the
noble
lines
of
ronsard
ou
pour
de
dieu
ou
pour
le
droit
de
mon
prince
navre
poitrine
ouverte
au
bord
de
mon
province
sakes
alive
said
the
american
gentleman
almost
in
an
awed
tone
then
he
added
are
there
two
maniacs
here
no
there
are
five
thundered
moon
smith
and
i
are
the
only
sane
people
left
michael
cried
rosamund
michael
what
does
it
mean
it
means
bosh
roared
michael
and
slung
his
painted
spear
hurtling
to
the
other
end
of
the
garden
it
means
that
doctors
are
bosh
and
criminology
is
bosh
and
americans
are
bosh
much
more
bosh
than
our
court
of
beacon
it
means
you
fatheads
that
innocent
smith
is
no
more
mad
or
bad
than
the
bird
on
that
tree
but
my
dear
moon
began
inglewood
in
his
modest
manner
these
gentlemen
on
the
word
of
two
doctors
exploded
moon
again
without
listening
to
anybody
else
shut
up
in
a
private
hell
on
the
word
of
two
doctors
and
such
doctors
oh
my
hat
look
at
do
just
look
at
would
you
read
a
book
or
buy
a
dog
or
go
to
a
hotel
on
the
advice
of
twenty
such
my
people
came
from
ireland
and
were
catholics
what
would
you
say
if
i
called
a
man
wicked
on
the
word
of
two
priests
but
it
is
only
their
word
michael
reasoned
rosamund
they
got
evidence
too
have
you
looked
at
it
asked
moon
no
said
rosamund
with
a
sort
of
faint
surprise
these
gentlemen
are
in
charge
of
it
and
of
everything
else
it
seems
to
me
said
michael
why
you
have
even
had
the
decency
to
consult
mrs
duke
oh
that
no
use
said
diana
in
an
undertone
to
rosamund
auntie
say
to
a
goose
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
answered
michael
for
with
such
a
flock
of
geese
to
say
it
to
the
horrid
expletive
might
be
constantly
on
her
lips
for
my
part
i
simply
refuse
to
let
things
be
done
in
this
light
and
airy
style
i
appeal
to
duke
it
her
house
mrs
duke
repeated
inglewood
doubtfully
yes
duke
said
michael
firmly
commonly
called
the
iron
duke
if
you
ask
auntie
said
diana
quietly
she
only
be
for
doing
nothing
at
all
her
only
idea
is
to
hush
things
up
or
to
let
things
slide
that
just
suits
her
yes
replied
michael
moon
and
as
it
happens
it
just
suits
all
of
us
you
are
impatient
with
your
elders
miss
duke
but
when
you
are
as
old
yourself
you
will
know
what
napoleon
knew
that
half
one
letters
answer
themselves
if
you
can
only
refrain
from
the
fleshly
appetite
of
answering
them
he
was
still
lounging
in
the
same
absurd
attitude
with
his
elbow
on
the
grate
but
his
voice
had
altered
abruptly
for
the
third
time
just
as
it
had
changed
from
the
mock
heroic
to
the
humanly
indignant
it
now
changed
to
the
airy
incisiveness
of
a
lawyer
giving
good
legal
advice
it
is
only
your
aunt
who
wants
to
keep
this
quiet
if
she
can
he
said
we
all
want
to
keep
it
quiet
if
we
can
look
at
the
large
facts
the
big
bones
of
the
case
i
believe
those
scientific
gentlemen
have
made
a
highly
scientific
mistake
i
believe
smith
is
as
blameless
as
a
buttercup
i
admit
buttercups
do
often
let
off
loaded
pistols
in
private
houses
i
admit
there
is
something
demanding
explanation
but
i
am
morally
certain
there
some
blunder
or
some
joke
or
some
allegory
or
some
accident
behind
all
this
well
suppose
i
wrong
we
disarmed
him
we
five
men
to
hold
him
he
may
as
well
go
to
a
later
on
as
now
but
suppose
there
even
a
chance
of
my
being
right
is
it
anybody
interest
here
to
wash
this
linen
in
public
come
i
take
each
of
you
in
order
once
take
smith
outside
that
gate
and
you
take
him
into
the
front
page
of
the
evening
papers
i
know
i
written
the
front
page
myself
miss
duke
do
you
or
your
aunt
want
a
sort
of
notice
stuck
up
over
your
shot
no
no
doctors
are
rubbish
as
i
said
but
you
do
want
the
rubbish
shot
here
arthur
suppose
i
am
right
or
suppose
i
am
wrong
smith
has
appeared
as
an
old
schoolfellow
of
yours
mark
my
words
if
he
proved
guilty
the
organs
of
public
opinion
will
say
you
introduced
him
if
he
proved
innocent
they
will
say
you
helped
to
collar
him
rosamund
my
dear
suppose
i
am
right
or
wrong
if
he
proved
guilty
they
say
you
engaged
your
companion
to
him
if
he
proved
innocent
they
print
that
telegram
i
know
the
organs
damn
them
he
stopped
an
instant
for
this
rapid
rationalism
left
him
more
breathless
than
had
either
his
theatrical
or
his
real
denunciation
but
he
was
plainly
in
earnest
as
well
as
positive
and
lucid
as
was
proved
by
his
proceeding
quickly
the
moment
he
had
found
his
breath
it
is
just
the
same
he
cried
with
our
medical
friends
you
will
say
that
warner
has
a
grievance
i
agree
but
does
he
want
specially
to
be
snapshotted
by
all
the
journalists
in
it
was
no
fault
of
his
but
the
scene
was
not
very
dignified
even
for
him
he
must
have
justice
but
does
he
want
to
ask
for
justice
not
only
on
his
knees
but
on
his
hands
and
knees
does
he
want
to
enter
the
court
of
justice
on
all
fours
doctors
are
not
allowed
to
advertise
and
i
sure
no
doctor
wants
to
advertise
himself
as
looking
like
that
and
even
for
our
american
guest
the
interest
is
the
same
let
us
suppose
that
he
has
conclusive
documents
let
us
assume
that
he
has
revelations
really
worth
reading
well
in
a
legal
inquiry
or
a
medical
inquiry
for
that
matter
ten
to
one
he
wo
be
allowed
to
read
them
he
be
tripped
up
every
two
or
three
minutes
with
some
tangle
of
old
rules
a
man
ca
tell
the
truth
in
public
nowadays
but
he
can
still
tell
it
in
private
he
can
tell
it
inside
that
house
it
is
quite
true
said
cyrus
pym
who
had
listened
throughout
the
speech
with
a
seriousness
which
only
an
american
could
have
retained
through
such
a
scene
it
is
true
that
i
have
been
less
hampered
in
private
inquiries
dr
pym
cried
warner
in
a
sort
of
sudden
anger
pym
you
are
really
going
to
admit
smith
may
be
mad
went
on
the
melancholy
moon
in
a
monologue
that
seemed
as
heavy
as
a
hatchet
but
there
was
something
after
all
in
what
he
said
about
home
rule
for
every
home
yes
there
is
something
when
all
said
and
done
in
the
high
court
of
beacon
it
is
really
true
that
human
beings
might
often
get
some
sort
of
domestic
justice
where
just
now
they
can
only
get
legal
injustice
oh
i
am
a
lawyer
too
and
i
know
that
as
well
it
is
true
that
there
too
much
official
and
indirect
power
often
and
often
the
thing
a
whole
nation
ca
settle
is
just
the
thing
a
family
could
settle
scores
of
young
criminals
have
been
fined
and
sent
to
jail
when
they
ought
to
have
been
thrashed
and
sent
to
bed
scores
of
men
i
am
sure
have
had
a
lifetime
at
hanwell
when
they
only
wanted
a
week
at
brighton
there
is
something
in
notion
of
domestic
and
i
propose
that
we
put
it
into
practice
you
have
the
prisoner
you
have
the
documents
come
we
are
a
company
of
free
white
christian
people
such
as
might
be
besieged
in
a
town
or
cast
up
on
a
desert
island
let
us
do
this
thing
ourselves
let
us
go
into
that
house
there
and
sit
down
and
find
out
with
our
own
eyes
and
ears
whether
this
thing
is
true
or
not
whether
this
smith
is
a
man
or
a
monster
if
we
ca
do
a
little
thing
like
that
what
right
have
we
to
put
crosses
on
ballot
papers
inglewood
and
pym
exchanged
a
glance
and
warner
who
was
no
fool
saw
in
that
glance
that
moon
was
gaining
ground
the
motives
that
led
arthur
to
think
of
surrender
were
indeed
very
different
from
those
which
affected
cyrus
pym
all
arthur
instincts
were
on
the
side
of
privacy
and
polite
settlement
he
was
very
english
and
would
often
endure
wrongs
rather
than
right
them
by
scenes
and
serious
rhetoric
to
play
at
once
the
buffoon
and
the
like
his
irish
friend
would
have
been
absolute
torture
to
him
but
even
the
part
he
had
played
that
afternoon
was
very
painful
he
was
not
likely
to
be
reluctant
if
any
one
could
convince
him
that
his
duty
was
to
let
sleeping
dogs
lie
on
the
other
hand
cyrus
pym
belonged
to
a
country
in
which
things
are
possible
that
seem
crazy
to
the
english
regulations
and
authorities
exactly
like
one
of
innocent
pranks
or
one
of
michael
satires
really
exist
propped
by
placid
policemen
and
imposed
on
bustling
business
men
pym
knew
whole
states
which
are
vast
and
yet
secret
and
fanciful
each
is
as
big
as
a
nation
yet
as
private
as
a
lost
village
and
as
unexpected
as
an
bed
states
where
no
man
may
have
a
cigarette
states
where
any
man
may
have
ten
wives
very
strict
prohibition
states
very
lax
divorce
states
all
these
large
local
vagaries
had
prepared
cyrus
pym
mind
for
small
local
vagaries
in
a
smaller
country
infinitely
more
remote
from
england
than
any
russian
or
italian
utterly
incapable
of
even
conceiving
what
english
conventions
are
he
could
not
see
the
social
impossibility
of
the
court
of
beacon
it
is
firmly
believed
by
those
who
shared
the
experiment
that
to
the
very
end
pym
believed
in
that
phantasmal
court
and
supposed
it
to
be
some
britannic
institution
towards
the
synod
thus
somewhat
at
a
standstill
there
approached
through
the
growing
haze
and
gloaming
a
short
dark
figure
with
a
walk
apparently
founded
on
the
imperfect
repression
of
a
negro
breakdown
something
at
once
in
the
familiarity
and
the
incongruity
of
this
being
moved
michael
to
even
heartier
outbursts
of
a
healthy
and
humane
flippancy
why
here
little
nosey
gould
he
exclaimed
is
the
mere
sight
of
him
enough
to
banish
all
your
morbid
reflections
really
replied
warner
i
really
fail
to
see
how
gould
affects
the
question
and
i
once
more
demand
hello
what
the
funeral
gents
inquired
the
newcomer
with
the
air
of
an
uproarious
umpire
doctor
demandin
something
always
the
way
at
a
you
know
always
lots
of
demand
no
supply
as
delicately
and
impartially
as
he
could
michael
restated
his
position
and
indicated
generally
that
smith
had
been
guilty
of
certain
dangerous
and
dubious
acts
and
that
there
had
even
arisen
an
allegation
that
he
was
insane
well
of
course
he
is
said
moses
gould
equably
it
need
old
to
see
that
the
face
of
he
added
with
abstract
relish
showed
a
shide
of
disappointment
the
gould
got
there
before
if
he
is
mad
began
inglewood
well
said
moses
when
a
cove
gets
out
on
the
tile
the
first
night
there
generally
a
tile
loose
you
never
objected
before
said
diana
duke
rather
stiffly
and
you
generally
pretty
free
with
your
complaints
i
do
compline
of
him
said
moses
magnanimously
the
poor
enough
you
might
tie
up
in
the
garden
here
and
make
noises
at
the
burglars
moses
said
moon
with
solemn
fervour
you
are
the
incarnation
of
common
sense
you
think
innocent
is
mad
let
me
introduce
you
to
the
incarnation
of
scientific
theory
he
also
thinks
innocent
is
doctor
this
is
my
friend
mr
moses
this
is
the
celebrated
dr
pym
the
celebrated
cyrus
pym
closed
his
eyes
and
bowed
he
also
murmured
his
national
in
a
low
voice
which
sounded
like
pleased
to
meet
you
now
you
two
people
said
michael
cheerfully
who
both
think
our
poor
friend
mad
shall
jolly
well
go
into
that
house
over
there
and
prove
him
mad
what
could
be
more
powerful
than
the
combination
of
scientific
theory
with
common
sense
united
you
stand
divided
you
fall
i
will
not
be
so
uncivil
as
to
suggest
that
pym
has
no
common
sense
i
confine
myself
to
recording
the
chronological
accident
that
he
has
not
shown
us
any
so
far
i
take
the
freedom
of
an
old
friend
in
staking
my
shirt
that
moses
has
no
scientific
theory
yet
against
this
strong
coalition
i
am
ready
to
appear
armed
with
nothing
but
an
intuition
which
is
american
for
a
guess
distinguished
by
gould
assistance
said
pym
opening
his
eyes
suddenly
i
gather
that
though
he
and
i
are
identical
in
primary
there
is
yet
between
us
something
that
can
not
be
called
a
disagreement
something
which
we
may
perhaps
call
a
he
put
the
points
of
thumb
and
forefinger
together
spreading
the
other
fingers
exquisitely
in
the
air
and
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
somebody
else
to
tell
him
what
to
say
catchin
flies
inquired
the
affable
moses
a
divergence
said
pym
with
a
refined
sigh
of
relief
a
divergence
granted
that
the
man
in
question
is
deranged
he
would
not
necessarily
be
all
that
science
requires
in
a
homicidal
maniac
has
it
occurred
to
you
observed
moon
who
was
leaning
on
the
gate
again
and
did
not
turn
round
that
if
he
were
a
homicidal
maniac
he
might
have
killed
us
all
here
while
we
were
talking
something
exploded
silently
underneath
all
their
minds
like
sealed
dynamite
in
some
forgotten
cellars
they
all
remembered
for
the
first
time
for
some
hour
or
two
that
the
monster
of
whom
they
were
talking
was
standing
quietly
among
them
they
had
left
him
in
the
garden
like
a
garden
statue
there
might
have
been
a
dolphin
coiling
round
his
legs
or
a
fountain
pouring
out
of
his
mouth
for
all
the
notice
they
had
taken
of
innocent
smith
he
stood
with
his
crest
of
blonde
blown
hair
thrust
somewhat
forward
his
rather
face
looking
patiently
downwards
at
nothing
in
particular
his
huge
shoulders
humped
and
his
hands
in
his
trousers
pockets
so
far
as
they
could
guess
he
had
not
moved
at
all
his
green
coat
might
have
been
cut
out
of
the
green
turf
on
which
he
stood
in
his
shadow
pym
had
expounded
and
rosamund
expostulated
michael
had
ranted
and
moses
had
ragged
he
had
remained
like
a
thing
graven
the
god
of
the
garden
a
sparrow
had
perched
on
one
of
his
heavy
shoulders
and
then
after
correcting
its
costume
of
feathers
had
flown
away
why
cried
michael
with
a
shout
of
laughter
the
court
of
beacon
has
opened
and
shut
up
again
too
you
all
know
now
i
am
right
your
buried
common
sense
has
told
you
what
my
buried
common
sense
has
told
me
smith
might
have
fired
off
a
hundred
cannons
instead
of
a
pistol
and
you
would
still
know
he
was
harmless
as
i
know
he
is
harmless
back
we
all
go
to
the
house
and
clear
a
room
for
discussion
for
the
high
court
of
beacon
which
has
already
arrived
at
its
decision
is
just
about
to
begin
its
inquiry
just
a
goin
to
begin
cried
little
moses
in
an
extraordinary
sort
of
disinterested
excitement
like
that
of
an
animal
during
music
or
a
thunderstorm
follow
on
to
the
court
of
eggs
and
bacon
a
kipper
from
the
old
firm
lordship
complimented
gould
on
the
professional
delicacy
had
shown
and
which
was
worthy
of
the
best
traditions
of
the
saloon
bar
and
three
of
scotch
hot
miss
oh
chase
me
girls
the
girls
betraying
no
temptation
to
chase
him
he
went
away
in
a
sort
of
waddling
dance
of
pure
excitement
and
had
made
a
circuit
of
the
garden
before
he
reappeared
breathless
but
still
beaming
moon
had
known
his
man
when
he
realized
that
no
people
presented
to
moses
gould
could
be
quite
serious
even
if
they
were
quite
furious
the
glass
doors
stood
open
on
the
side
nearest
to
moses
gould
and
as
the
feet
of
that
festive
idiot
were
evidently
turned
in
the
same
direction
everybody
else
went
that
way
with
the
unanimity
of
some
uproarious
procession
only
diana
duke
retained
enough
rigidity
to
say
the
thing
that
had
been
boiling
at
her
fierce
feminine
lips
for
the
last
few
hours
under
the
shadow
of
tragedy
she
had
kept
it
back
as
unsympathetic
in
that
case
she
said
sharply
these
cabs
can
be
sent
away
well
innocent
must
have
his
bag
you
know
said
mary
with
a
smile
i
dare
say
the
cabman
would
get
it
down
for
us
i
get
the
bag
said
smith
speaking
for
the
first
time
in
hours
his
voice
sounded
remote
and
rude
like
the
voice
of
a
statue
those
who
had
so
long
danced
and
disputed
round
his
immobility
were
left
breathless
by
his
precipitance
with
a
run
and
spring
he
was
out
of
the
garden
into
the
street
with
a
spring
and
one
quivering
kick
he
was
actually
on
the
roof
of
the
cab
the
cabman
happened
to
be
standing
by
the
horse
head
having
just
removed
its
emptied
smith
seemed
for
an
instant
to
be
rolling
about
on
the
cab
back
in
the
embraces
of
his
gladstone
bag
the
next
instant
however
he
had
rolled
as
if
by
a
royal
luck
into
the
high
seat
behind
and
with
a
shriek
of
piercing
and
appalling
suddenness
had
sent
the
horse
flying
and
scampering
down
the
street
his
evanescence
was
so
violent
and
swift
that
this
time
it
was
all
the
other
people
who
were
turned
into
garden
statues
moses
gould
however
being
both
physically
and
morally
for
the
purposes
of
permanent
sculpture
came
to
life
some
time
before
the
rest
and
turning
to
moon
remarked
like
a
man
starting
chattily
with
a
stranger
on
an
omnibus
tile
loose
eh
cab
loose
anyhow
there
followed
a
fatal
silence
and
then
warner
said
with
a
sneer
like
a
club
of
stone
this
is
what
comes
of
the
court
of
beacon
mr
moon
you
have
let
loose
a
maniac
on
the
whole
metropolis
beacon
house
stood
as
has
been
said
at
the
end
of
a
long
crescent
of
continuous
houses
the
little
garden
that
shut
it
in
ran
out
into
a
sharp
point
like
a
green
cape
pushed
out
into
the
sea
of
two
streets
smith
and
his
cab
shot
up
one
side
of
the
triangle
and
certainly
most
of
those
standing
inside
of
it
never
expected
to
see
him
again
at
the
apex
however
he
turned
the
horse
sharply
round
and
drove
with
equal
violence
up
the
other
side
of
the
garden
visible
to
all
those
in
the
group
with
a
common
impulse
the
little
crowd
ran
across
the
lawn
as
if
to
stop
him
but
they
soon
had
reason
to
duck
and
recoil
even
as
he
vanished
up
street
for
the
second
time
he
let
the
big
yellow
bag
fly
from
his
hand
so
that
it
fell
in
the
centre
of
the
garden
scattering
the
company
like
a
bomb
and
nearly
damaging
warner
hat
for
the
third
time
long
before
they
had
collected
themselves
the
cab
had
shot
away
with
a
shriek
that
went
into
a
whisper
well
said
michael
moon
with
a
queer
note
in
his
voice
you
may
as
well
all
go
inside
anyhow
we
got
two
relics
of
smith
at
least
his
fiancee
and
his
trunk
why
do
you
want
us
to
go
inside
asked
arthur
inglewood
in
whose
red
brow
and
rough
brown
hair
botheration
seemed
to
have
reached
its
limit
i
want
the
rest
to
go
in
said
michael
in
a
clear
voice
because
i
want
the
whole
of
this
garden
in
which
to
talk
to
you
there
was
an
atmosphere
of
irrational
doubt
it
was
really
getting
colder
and
a
night
wind
had
begun
to
wave
the
one
or
two
trees
in
the
twilight
warner
however
spoke
in
a
voice
devoid
of
indecision
i
refuse
to
listen
to
any
such
proposal
he
said
you
have
lost
this
ruffian
and
i
must
find
him
i
do
ask
you
to
listen
to
any
proposal
answered
moon
quietly
i
only
ask
you
to
listen
he
made
a
silencing
movement
with
his
hand
and
immediately
the
whistling
noise
that
had
been
lost
in
the
dark
streets
on
one
side
of
the
house
could
be
heard
from
quite
a
new
quarter
on
the
other
side
through
the
of
streets
the
noise
increased
with
incredible
rapidity
and
the
next
moment
the
flying
hoofs
and
flashing
wheels
had
swept
up
to
the
gate
at
which
they
had
originally
stood
smith
got
down
from
his
perch
with
an
air
of
and
coming
back
into
the
garden
stood
in
the
same
elephantine
attitude
as
before
get
inside
get
inside
cried
moon
hilariously
with
the
air
of
one
shooing
a
company
of
cats
come
come
be
quick
about
it
did
i
tell
you
i
wanted
to
talk
to
inglewood
how
they
were
all
really
driven
into
the
house
again
it
would
have
been
difficult
afterwards
to
say
they
had
reached
the
point
of
being
exhausted
with
incongruities
as
people
at
a
farce
are
ill
with
laughing
and
the
brisk
growth
of
the
storm
among
the
trees
seemed
like
a
final
gesture
of
things
in
general
inglewood
lingered
behind
them
saying
with
a
certain
amicable
exasperation
i
say
do
you
really
want
to
speak
to
me
i
do
said
michael
very
much
night
had
come
as
it
generally
does
quicker
than
the
twilight
had
seemed
to
promise
while
the
human
eye
still
felt
the
sky
as
light
gray
a
very
large
and
lustrous
moon
appearing
abruptly
above
a
bulk
of
roofs
and
trees
proved
by
contrast
that
the
sky
was
already
a
very
dark
gray
indeed
a
drift
of
barren
leaves
across
the
lawn
a
drift
of
riven
clouds
across
the
sky
seemed
to
be
lifted
on
the
same
strong
and
yet
laborious
wind
arthur
said
michael
i
began
with
an
intuition
but
now
i
am
sure
you
and
i
are
going
to
defend
this
friend
of
yours
before
the
blessed
court
of
beacon
and
to
clear
him
too
clear
him
of
both
crime
and
lunacy
just
listen
to
me
while
i
preach
to
you
for
a
bit
they
walked
up
and
down
the
darkening
garden
together
as
michael
moon
went
on
can
you
asked
michael
shut
your
eyes
and
see
some
of
those
queer
old
hieroglyphics
they
stuck
up
on
white
walls
in
the
old
hot
countries
how
stiff
they
were
in
shape
and
yet
how
gaudy
in
colour
think
of
some
alphabet
of
arbitrary
figures
picked
out
in
black
and
red
or
white
and
green
with
some
old
semitic
crowd
of
nosey
ancestors
staring
at
it
and
try
to
think
why
the
people
put
it
up
at
all
inglewood
first
instinct
was
to
think
that
his
perplexing
friend
had
really
gone
off
his
head
at
last
there
seemed
so
reckless
a
flight
of
irrelevancy
from
the
walls
he
was
asked
to
imagine
to
the
gray
and
somewhat
chilly
suburban
garden
in
which
he
was
actually
kicking
his
heels
how
he
could
be
more
happy
in
one
by
imagining
the
other
he
could
not
conceive
both
in
themselves
were
unpleasant
why
does
everybody
repeat
riddles
went
on
moon
abruptly
even
if
they
forgotten
the
answers
riddles
are
easy
to
remember
because
they
are
hard
to
guess
so
were
those
stiff
old
symbols
in
black
red
or
green
easy
to
remember
because
they
had
been
hard
to
guess
their
colours
were
plain
their
shapes
were
plain
everything
was
plain
except
the
meaning
inglewood
was
about
to
open
his
mouth
in
an
amiable
protest
but
moon
went
on
plunging
quicker
and
quicker
up
and
down
the
garden
and
smoking
faster
and
faster
dances
too
he
said
dances
were
not
frivolous
dances
were
harder
to
understand
than
inscriptions
and
texts
the
old
dances
were
stiff
ceremonial
highly
coloured
but
silent
have
you
noticed
anything
odd
about
smith
well
really
cried
inglewood
left
behind
in
a
collapse
of
humour
have
i
noticed
anything
else
have
you
noticed
this
about
him
asked
moon
with
unshaken
persistency
that
he
has
done
so
much
and
said
so
little
when
first
he
came
he
talked
but
in
a
gasping
irregular
sort
of
way
as
if
he
was
used
to
it
all
he
really
did
was
actions
painting
red
flowers
on
black
gowns
or
throwing
yellow
bags
on
to
the
grass
i
tell
you
that
big
green
figure
is
figurative
like
any
green
figure
capering
on
some
white
eastern
wall
my
dear
michael
cried
inglewood
in
a
rising
irritation
which
increased
with
the
rising
wind
you
are
getting
absurdly
fanciful
i
think
of
what
has
just
happened
said
michael
steadily
the
man
has
not
spoken
for
hours
and
yet
he
has
been
speaking
all
the
time
he
fired
three
shots
from
a
and
then
gave
it
up
to
us
when
he
might
have
shot
us
dead
in
our
boots
how
could
he
express
his
trust
in
us
better
than
that
he
wanted
to
be
tried
by
us
how
could
he
have
shown
it
better
than
by
standing
quite
still
and
letting
us
discuss
it
he
wanted
to
show
that
he
stood
there
willingly
and
could
escape
if
he
liked
how
could
he
have
shown
it
better
than
by
escaping
in
the
cab
and
coming
back
again
innocent
smith
is
not
a
madman
he
is
a
ritualist
he
wants
to
express
himself
not
with
his
tongue
but
with
his
arms
and
legs
with
my
body
i
thee
worship
as
it
says
in
the
marriage
service
i
begin
to
understand
the
old
plays
and
pageants
i
see
why
the
mutes
at
a
funeral
were
mute
i
see
why
the
mummers
were
mum
they
meant
something
and
smith
means
something
too
all
other
jokes
have
to
be
noisy
like
little
nosey
gould
jokes
for
instance
the
only
silent
jokes
are
the
practical
jokes
poor
smith
properly
considered
is
an
allegorical
practical
joker
what
he
has
really
done
in
this
house
has
been
as
frantic
as
a
but
as
silent
as
a
picture
i
suppose
you
mean
said
the
other
dubiously
that
we
have
got
to
find
out
what
all
these
crimes
meant
as
if
they
were
so
many
coloured
but
even
supposing
that
they
do
mean
something
why
lord
bless
my
soul
taking
the
turn
of
the
garden
quite
naturally
he
had
lifted
his
eyes
to
the
moon
by
this
time
risen
big
and
luminous
and
had
seen
a
huge
figure
sitting
on
the
garden
wall
it
was
outlined
so
sharply
against
the
moon
that
for
the
first
flash
it
was
hard
to
be
certain
even
that
it
was
human
the
hunched
shoulders
and
outstanding
hair
had
rather
the
air
of
a
colossal
cat
it
resembled
a
cat
also
in
the
fact
that
when
first
startled
it
sprang
up
and
ran
with
easy
activity
along
the
top
of
the
wall
as
it
ran
however
its
heavy
shoulders
and
small
stooping
head
rather
suggested
a
baboon
the
instant
it
came
within
reach
of
a
tree
it
made
an
leap
and
was
lost
in
the
branches
the
gale
which
by
this
time
was
shaking
every
shrub
in
the
garden
made
the
identification
yet
more
difficult
since
it
melted
the
moving
limbs
of
the
fugitive
in
the
multitudinous
moving
limbs
of
the
tree
who
is
there
shouted
arthur
who
are
you
are
you
innocent
not
quite
answered
an
obscure
voice
among
the
leaves
i
cheated
you
once
about
a
penknife
the
wind
in
the
garden
had
gathered
strength
and
was
throwing
the
tree
backwards
and
forwards
with
the
man
in
the
thick
of
it
just
as
it
had
on
the
gay
and
golden
afternoon
when
he
had
first
arrived
but
are
you
smith
asked
inglewood
as
in
an
agony
very
nearly
said
the
voice
out
of
the
tossing
tree
but
you
must
have
some
real
names
shrieked
inglewood
in
despair
you
must
call
yourself
something
call
myself
something
thundered
the
obscure
voice
shaking
the
tree
so
that
all
its
ten
thousand
leaves
seemed
to
be
talking
at
once
i
call
myself

manalive
began
inglewood
in
exasperation
that
right
that
right
came
with
a
roar
out
of
the
rocking
tree
that
my
real
name
and
he
broke

one
or
two

chapter
i
the
eye

or
the
murder
charge
the
of
the
dukes
had
been
set
out
for
the
court
of
beacon
with
a
certain
impromptu
pomposity
that
seemed
somehow
to
increase
its
cosiness
the
big
room
was
as
it
were
cut
up
into
small
rooms
with
walls
only
waist
high
the
sort
of
separation
that
children
make
when
they
are
playing
at
shops
this
had
been
done
by
moses
gould
and
michael
moon
the
two
most
active
members
of
this
remarkable
inquiry
with
the
ordinary
furniture
of
the
place
at
one
end
of
the
long
mahogany
table
was
set
the
one
enormous
garden
chair
which
was
surmounted
by
the
old
torn
tent
or
umbrella
which
smith
himself
had
suggested
as
a
coronation
canopy
inside
this
erection
could
be
perceived
the
dumpy
form
of
duke
with
cushions
and
a
form
of
countenance
that
already
threatened
slumber
at
the
other
end
sat
the
accused
smith
in
a
kind
of
dock
for
he
was
carefully
fenced
in
with
a
quadrilateral
of
light
bedroom
chairs
any
of
which
he
could
have
tossed
out
the
window
with
his
big
toe
he
had
been
provided
with
pens
and
paper
out
of
the
latter
of
which
he
made
paper
boats
paper
darts
and
paper
dolls
contentedly
throughout
the
whole
proceedings
he
never
spoke
or
even
looked
up
but
seemed
as
unconscious
as
a
child
on
the
floor
of
an
empty
nursery
on
a
row
of
chairs
raised
high
on
the
top
of
a
long
settee
sat
the
three
young
ladies
with
their
backs
up
against
the
window
and
mary
gray
in
the
middle
it
was
something
between
a
jury
box
and
the
stall
of
the
queen
of
beauty
at
a
tournament
down
the
centre
of
the
long
table
moon
had
built
a
low
barrier
out
of
eight
bound
volumes
of
good
words
to
express
the
moral
wall
that
divided
the
conflicting
parties
on
the
right
side
sat
the
two
advocates
of
the
prosecution
pym
and
gould
behind
a
barricade
of
books
and
documents
chiefly
in
the
case
of
pym
solid
volumes
of
criminology
on
the
other
side
moon
and
inglewood
for
the
defence
were
also
fortified
with
books
and
papers
but
as
these
included
several
old
yellow
volumes
by
ouida
and
wilkie
collins
the
hand
of
mr
moon
seemed
to
have
been
somewhat
careless
and
comprehensive
as
for
the
victim
and
prosecutor
warner
moon
wanted
at
first
to
have
him
kept
entirely
behind
a
high
screen
in
the
corner
urging
the
indelicacy
of
his
appearance
in
court
but
privately
assuring
him
of
an
unofficial
permission
to
peep
over
the
top
now
and
then
warner
however
failed
to
rise
to
the
chivalry
of
such
a
course
and
after
some
little
disturbance
and
discussion
he
was
accommodated
with
a
seat
on
the
right
side
of
the
table
in
a
line
with
his
legal
advisers
it
was
before
this
tribunal
that
cyrus
pym
after
passing
a
hand
through
the
hair
over
each
ear
rose
to
open
the
case
his
statement
was
clear
and
even
restrained
and
such
flights
of
imagery
as
occurred
in
it
only
attracted
attention
by
a
certain
indescribable
abruptness
not
uncommon
in
the
flowers
of
american
speech
he
planted
the
points
of
his
ten
frail
fingers
on
the
mahogany
closed
his
eyes
and
opened
his
mouth
the
time
has
gone
by
he
said
when
murder
could
be
regarded
as
a
moral
and
individual
act
important
perhaps
to
the
murderer
perhaps
to
the
murdered
science
has
profoundly
here
he
paused
poising
his
compressed
finger
and
thumb
in
the
air
as
if
he
were
holding
an
elusive
idea
very
tight
by
its
tail
then
he
screwed
up
his
eyes
and
said
modified
and
let
it
go
has
profoundly
modified
our
view
of
death
in
superstitious
ages
it
was
regarded
as
the
termination
of
life
catastrophic
and
even
tragic
and
was
often
surrounded
by
solemnity
brighter
days
however
have
dawned
and
we
now
see
death
as
universal
and
inevitable
as
part
of
that
great
and
average
which
we
call
for
convenience
the
order
of
nature
in
the
same
way
we
have
come
to
consider
murder
socially
rising
above
the
mere
private
feelings
of
a
man
while
being
forcibly
deprived
of
life
we
are
privileged
to
behold
murder
as
a
mighty
whole
to
see
the
rich
rotation
of
the
cosmos
bringing
as
it
brings
the
golden
harvests
and
the
harvesters
the
return
for
ever
of
the
slayers
and
the
slain
he
looked
down
somewhat
affected
with
his
own
eloquence
coughed
slightly
putting
up
four
of
his
pointed
fingers
with
the
excellent
manners
of
boston
and
continued
there
is
but
one
result
of
this
happier
and
humaner
outlook
which
concerns
the
wretched
man
before
us
it
is
that
thoroughly
elucidated
by
a
milwaukee
doctor
our
great
sonnenschein
in
his
great
work
destructive
type
we
do
not
denounce
smith
as
a
murderer
but
rather
as
a
murderous
man
the
type
is
such
that
its
very
life
i
might
say
its
very
health
is
in
killing
some
hold
that
it
is
not
properly
an
aberration
but
a
newer
and
even
a
higher
creature
my
dear
old
friend
bulger
who
kept
ferrets
here
moon
suddenly
ejaculated
a
loud
hurrah
but
so
instantaneously
resumed
his
tragic
expression
that
duke
looked
everywhere
else
for
the
sound
pym
continued
somewhat
sternly
who
in
the
interests
of
knowledge
kept
ferrets
felt
that
the
ferocity
is
not
utilitarian
but
absolutely
an
end
in
itself
however
this
may
be
with
ferrets
it
is
certainly
so
with
the
prisoner
in
his
other
iniquities
you
may
find
the
cunning
of
the
maniac
but
his
acts
of
blood
have
almost
the
simplicity
of
sanity
but
it
is
the
awful
sanity
of
the
sun
and
the
elements
a
cruel
an
evil
sanity
as
soon
stay
the
cataracts
of
our
virgin
west
as
stay
the
natural
force
that
sends
him
forth
to
slay
no
environment
however
scientific
could
have
softened
him
place
that
man
in
the
purity
of
the
palest
cloister
and
there
will
be
some
deed
of
violence
done
with
the
crozier
or
the
alb
rear
him
in
a
happy
nursery
amid
our
infancy
and
he
will
find
some
way
to
strangle
with
the
or
brain
with
the
brick
circumstances
may
be
favourable
training
may
be
admirable
hopes
may
be
high
but
the
huge
elemental
hunger
of
innocent
smith
for
blood
will
in
its
appointed
season
burst
like
a
bomb
arthur
inglewood
glanced
curiously
for
an
instant
at
the
huge
creature
at
the
foot
of
the
table
who
was
fitting
a
paper
figure
with
a
cocked
hat
and
then
looked
back
at
pym
who
was
concluding
in
a
quieter
tone
it
only
remains
for
us
he
said
to
bring
forward
actual
evidence
of
his
previous
attempts
by
an
agreement
already
made
with
the
court
and
the
leaders
of
the
defence
we
are
permitted
to
put
in
evidence
authentic
letters
from
witnesses
to
these
scenes
which
the
defence
is
free
to
examine
out
of
several
cases
of
such
outrages
we
have
decided
to
select
one
the
clearest
and
most
scandalous
i
will
therefore
without
further
delay
call
on
my
junior
gould
to
read
two
letters
one
from
the
and
the
other
from
the
porter
of
brakespeare
college
in
cambridge
university
gould
jumped
up
with
a
jerk
like
a
an
paper
in
his
hand
and
a
fever
of
importance
on
his
face
he
began
in
a
loud
high
cockney
voice
that
was
as
abrupt
as
a
sir
hi
am
the
of
brikespeare
college
cambridge
lord
have
mercy
on
us
muttered
moon
making
a
backward
movement
as
men
do
when
a
gun
goes
off
hi
am
the
of
brikespeare
college
cambridge
proclaimed
the
uncompromising
moses
and
i
can
endorse
the
description
you
gave
of
the
smith
it
was
not
alone
my
unfortunate
duty
to
rebuke
many
of
the
lesser
violences
of
his
undergraduate
period
but
i
was
actually
a
witness
to
the
last
iniquity
which
terminated
that
period
hi
happened
to
passing
under
the
house
of
my
friend
the
warden
of
brikespeare
which
is
from
the
college
and
connected
with
it
by
two
or
three
very
ancient
arches
or
props
like
bridges
across
a
small
strip
of
water
connected
with
the
river
to
my
grive
astonishment
i
my
eminent
friend
suspended
in
and
clinging
to
one
of
these
pieces
of
masonry
his
appearance
and
attitude
indicatin
that
he
suffered
from
the
grivest
apprehensions
after
a
short
time
i
heard
two
very
loud
shots
and
distinctly
perceived
the
unfortunate
undergraduate
smith
leaning
far
out
of
the
window
and
aiming
at
the
warden
repeatedly
with
a
revolver
upon
seeing
me
smith
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
in
which
impertinence
was
mingled
with
insanity
and
appeared
to
desist
i
sent
the
college
porter
for
a
ladder
and
he
succeeded
in
detaching
the
warden
from
his
painful
position
smith
was
sent
down
the
photograph
i
enclose
is
from
the
group
of
the
university
rifle
club
prizemen
and
represents
him
as
he
was
when
at
the
hi
am
your
obedient
servant
amos
boulter
the
other
letter
continued
gould
in
a
glow
of
triumph
is
from
the
porter
and
wo
take
long
to
read
dear
sir
it
is
quite
true
that
i
am
the
porter
of
brikespeare
college
and
that
i
the
warden
down
when
the
young
man
was
shooting
at
him
as
boulter
has
said
in
his
letter
the
young
man
who
was
shooting
at
him
was
smith
the
same
that
is
in
the
photograph
boulter
yours
respectfully
samuel
barker
gould
handed
the
two
letters
across
to
moon
who
examined
them
but
for
the
vocal
divergences
in
the
matter
of
h
and
a
the
letter
was
exactly
as
gould
had
rendered
it
and
both
that
and
the
porter
letter
were
plainly
genuine
moon
handed
them
to
inglewood
who
handed
them
back
in
silence
to
moses
gould
so
far
as
this
first
charge
of
continual
attempted
murder
is
concerned
said
pym
standing
up
for
the
last
time
that
is
my
case
michael
moon
rose
for
the
defence
with
an
air
of
depression
which
gave
little
hope
at
the
outset
to
the
sympathizers
with
the
prisoner
he
did
not
he
said
propose
to
follow
the
doctor
into
the
abstract
questions
i
do
not
know
enough
to
be
an
agnostic
he
said
rather
wearily
and
i
can
only
master
the
known
and
admitted
elements
in
such
controversies
as
for
science
and
religion
the
known
and
admitted
facts
are
plain
enough
all
that
the
parsons
say
is
unproved
all
that
the
doctors
say
is
disproved
that
the
only
difference
between
science
and
religion
there
ever
been
or
will
be
yet
these
new
discoveries
touch
me
somehow
he
said
looking
down
sorrowfully
at
his
boots
they
remind
me
of
a
dear
old
of
mine
who
used
to
enjoy
them
in
her
youth
it
brings
tears
to
my
eyes
i
can
see
the
old
bucket
by
the
garden
fence
and
the
line
of
shimmering
poplars
behind
hi
here
stop
the
a
bit
cried
moses
gould
rising
in
a
sort
of
perspiration
we
want
to
give
the
defence
a
fair
run
like
gents
you
know
but
any
gent
would
draw
the
line
at
shimmering
poplars
well
hang
it
all
said
moon
in
an
injured
manner
if
pym
may
have
an
old
friend
with
ferrets
why
may
i
have
an
old
aunt
with
poplars
i
am
sure
said
duke
bridling
with
something
almost
like
a
shaky
authority
mr
moon
may
have
what
aunts
he
likes
why
as
to
liking
her
began
moon
i
but
perhaps
as
you
say
she
is
scarcely
the
core
of
the
question
i
repeat
that
i
do
not
mean
to
follow
the
abstract
speculations
for
indeed
my
answer
to
pym
is
simple
and
severely
concrete
pym
has
only
treated
one
side
of
the
psychology
of
murder
if
it
is
true
that
there
is
a
kind
of
man
who
has
a
natural
tendency
to
murder
is
it
not
equally
true
here
he
lowered
his
voice
and
spoke
with
a
crushing
quietude
and
earnestness
is
it
not
equally
true
that
there
is
a
kind
of
man
who
has
a
natural
tendency
to
get
murdered
is
it
not
at
least
a
hypothesis
holding
the
field
that
warner
is
such
a
man
i
do
not
speak
without
the
book
any
more
than
my
learned
friend
the
whole
matter
is
expounded
in
moonenschein
monumental
work
destructible
doctor
with
diagrams
showing
the
various
ways
in
which
such
a
person
as
warner
may
be
resolved
into
his
elements
in
the
light
of
these
facts
hi
stop
the
stop
the
cried
moses
jumping
up
and
down
and
gesticulating
in
great
excitement
my
principal
got
something
to
say
my
principal
wants
to
do
a
bit
of
talkin
pym
was
indeed
on
his
feet
looking
pallid
and
rather
vicious
i
have
strictly
myself
he
said
nasally
to
books
to
which
immediate
reference
can
be
made
i
have
sonnenschein
type
here
on
the
table
if
the
defence
wish
to
see
it
where
is
this
wonderful
work
on
destructability
mr
moon
is
talking
about
does
it
exist
can
he
produce
it
produce
it
cried
the
irishman
with
a
rich
scorn
i
produce
it
in
a
week
if
you
pay
for
the
ink
and
paper
would
it
have
much
authority
asked
pym
sitting
down
oh
authority
said
moon
lightly
that
depends
on
a
fellow
religion
pym
jumped
up
again
our
authority
is
based
on
masses
of
accurate
detail
he
said
it
deals
with
a
region
in
which
things
can
be
handled
and
tested
my
opponent
will
at
least
admit
that
death
is
a
fact
of
experience
not
of
mine
said
moon
mournfully
shaking
his
head
i
never
experienced
such
a
thing
in
all
my
life
well
really
said
pym
and
sat
down
sharply
amid
a
crackle
of
papers
so
we
see
resumed
moon
in
the
same
melancholy
voice
that
a
man
like
warner
is
in
the
mysterious
workings
of
evolution
doomed
to
such
attacks
my
client
onslaught
even
if
it
occurred
was
not
unique
i
have
in
my
hand
letters
from
more
than
one
acquaintance
of
warner
whom
that
remarkable
man
has
affected
in
the
same
way
following
the
example
of
my
learned
friends
i
will
read
only
two
of
them
the
first
is
from
an
honest
and
laborious
matron
living
off
the
harrow
road
mr
moon
sir
yes
i
did
throw
a
sorsepan
at
him
wot
then
it
was
all
i
had
to
throw
all
the
soft
things
being
porned
and
if
your
docter
warner
does
like
having
sorsepans
thrown
at
him
do
let
him
wear
his
hat
in
a
respectable
woman
parler
and
tell
him
to
leave
orf
smiling
or
tell
us
the
yours
respectfully
hannah
miles
the
other
letter
is
from
a
physician
of
some
note
in
dublin
with
whom
warner
was
once
engaged
in
consultation
he
writes
as
follows
dear
sir
the
incident
to
which
you
refer
is
one
which
i
regret
and
which
moreover
i
have
never
been
able
to
explain
my
own
branch
of
medicine
is
not
mental
and
i
should
be
glad
to
have
the
view
of
a
mental
specialist
on
my
singular
momentary
and
indeed
almost
automatic
action
to
say
that
i
warner
nose
is
however
inaccurate
in
a
respect
that
strikes
me
as
important
that
i
punched
his
nose
i
must
cheerfully
admit
i
need
not
say
with
what
regret
but
pulling
seems
to
me
to
imply
a
precision
of
objective
with
which
i
can
not
reproach
myself
in
comparison
with
this
the
act
of
punching
was
an
outward
instantaneous
and
even
natural
believe
me
yours
faithfully
burton
lestrange
i
have
numberless
other
letters
continued
moon
all
bearing
witness
to
this
widespread
feeling
about
my
eminent
friend
and
i
therefore
think
that
pym
should
have
admitted
this
side
of
the
question
in
his
survey
we
are
in
the
presence
as
pym
so
truly
says
of
a
natural
force
as
soon
stay
the
cataract
of
the
london
as
stay
the
great
tendency
of
warner
to
be
assassinated
by
somebody
place
that
man
in
a
quakers
meeting
among
the
most
peaceful
of
christians
and
he
will
immediately
be
beaten
to
death
with
sticks
of
chocolate
place
him
among
the
angels
of
the
new
jerusalem
and
he
will
be
stoned
to
death
with
precious
stones
circumstances
may
be
beautiful
and
wonderful
the
average
may
be
the
harvester
may
be
the
doctor
may
be
the
cataract
may
be
the
infant
may
be
but
against
and
above
all
these
prodigies
the
grand
simple
tendency
of
warner
to
get
murdered
will
still
pursue
its
way
until
it
happily
and
triumphantly
succeeds
at
last
he
pronounced
this
peroration
with
an
appearance
of
strong
emotion
but
even
stronger
emotions
were
manifesting
themselves
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
warner
had
leaned
his
large
body
quite
across
the
little
figure
of
moses
gould
and
was
talking
in
excited
whispers
to
pym
that
expert
nodded
a
great
many
times
and
finally
started
to
his
feet
with
a
sincere
expression
of
sternness
ladies
and
gentlemen
he
cried
indignantly
as
my
colleague
has
said
we
should
be
delighted
to
give
any
latitude
to
the
defence
if
there
were
a
defence
but
mr
moon
seems
to
think
he
is
there
to
make
jokes
very
good
jokes
i
dare
say
but
not
at
all
adapted
to
assist
his
client
he
picks
holes
in
science
he
picks
holes
in
my
client
social
popularity
he
picks
holes
in
my
literary
style
which
does
seem
to
suit
his
european
taste
but
how
does
this
picking
of
holes
affect
the
issue
this
smith
has
picked
two
holes
in
my
client
hat
and
with
an
inch
better
aim
would
have
picked
two
holes
in
his
head
all
the
jokes
in
the
world
wo
unpick
those
holes
or
be
any
use
for
the
defence
inglewood
looked
down
in
some
embarrassment
as
if
shaken
by
the
evident
fairness
of
this
but
moon
still
gazed
at
his
opponent
in
a
dreamy
way
the
defence
he
said
vaguely
oh
i
have
begun
that
yet
you
certainly
have
not
said
pym
warmly
amid
a
murmur
of
applause
from
his
side
which
the
other
side
found
it
impossible
to
answer
perhaps
if
you
have
any
defence
which
has
been
doubtful
from
the
very
beginning
while
you
standing
up
said
moon
in
the
same
almost
sleepy
style
perhaps
i
might
ask
you
a
question
a
question
certainly
said
pym
stiffly
it
was
distinctly
arranged
between
us
that
as
we
could
not
the
witnesses
we
might
vicariously
each
other
we
are
in
a
position
to
invite
all
such
inquiry
i
think
you
said
observed
moon
absently
that
none
of
the
shots
really
hit
the
doctor
for
the
cause
of
science
cried
the
complacent
pym
fortunately
not
yet
they
were
fired
from
a
few
feet
away
yes
about
four
feet
and
no
shots
hit
the
warden
though
they
were
fired
quite
close
to
him
too
asked
moon
that
is
so
said
the
witness
gravely
i
think
said
moon
suppressing
a
slight
yawn
that
your
mentioned
that
smith
was
one
of
the
university
record
men
for
shooting
why
as
to
that
began
pym
after
an
instant
of
stillness
a
second
question
continued
moon
comparatively
curtly
you
said
there
were
other
cases
of
the
accused
trying
to
kill
people
why
have
you
not
got
evidence
of
them
the
american
planted
the
points
of
his
fingers
on
the
table
again
in
those
cases
he
said
precisely
there
was
no
evidence
from
outsiders
as
in
the
cambridge
case
but
only
the
evidence
of
the
actual
victims
why
did
you
get
their
evidence
in
the
case
of
the
actual
victims
said
pym
there
was
some
difficulty
and
reluctance
and
do
you
mean
asked
moon
that
none
of
the
actual
victims
would
appear
against
the
prisoner
that
would
be
exaggerative
began
the
other
a
third
question
said
moon
so
sharply
that
every
one
jumped
you
got
the
evidence
of
the
who
heard
some
shots
where
the
evidence
of
the
warden
himself
who
was
shot
at
the
warden
of
brakespeare
lives
a
prosperous
gentleman
we
did
ask
for
a
statement
from
him
said
pym
a
little
nervously
but
it
was
so
eccentrically
expressed
that
we
suppressed
it
out
of
deference
to
an
old
gentleman
whose
past
services
to
science
have
been
great
moon
leaned
forward
you
mean
i
suppose
he
said
that
his
statement
was
favourable
to
the
prisoner
it
might
be
understood
so
replied
the
american
doctor
but
really
it
was
difficult
to
understand
at
all
in
fact
we
sent
it
back
to
him
you
have
no
longer
then
any
statement
signed
by
the
warden
of
brakespeare
no
i
only
ask
said
michael
quietly
because
we
have
to
conclude
my
case
i
will
ask
my
junior
inglewood
to
read
a
statement
of
the
true
story
a
statement
attested
as
true
by
the
signature
of
the
warden
himself
arthur
inglewood
rose
with
several
papers
in
his
hand
and
though
he
looked
somewhat
refined
and
as
he
always
did
the
spectators
were
surprised
to
feel
that
his
presence
was
upon
the
whole
more
efficient
and
sufficing
than
his
leader
he
was
in
truth
one
of
those
modest
men
who
can
not
speak
until
they
are
told
to
speak
and
then
can
speak
well
moon
was
entirely
the
opposite
his
own
impudences
amused
him
in
private
but
they
slightly
embarrassed
him
in
public
he
felt
a
fool
while
he
was
speaking
whereas
inglewood
felt
a
fool
only
because
he
could
not
speak
the
moment
he
had
anything
to
say
he
could
speak
and
the
moment
he
could
speak
speaking
seemed
quite
natural
nothing
in
this
universe
seemed
quite
natural
to
michael
moon
as
my
colleague
has
just
explained
said
inglewood
there
are
two
enigmas
or
inconsistencies
on
which
we
base
the
defence
the
first
is
a
plain
physical
fact
by
the
admission
of
everybody
by
the
very
evidence
adduced
by
the
prosecution
it
is
clear
that
the
accused
was
celebrated
as
a
specially
good
shot
yet
on
both
the
occasions
complained
of
he
shot
from
a
distance
of
four
or
five
feet
and
shot
at
him
four
or
five
times
and
never
hit
him
once
that
is
the
first
startling
circumstance
on
which
we
base
our
argument
the
second
as
my
colleague
has
urged
is
the
curious
fact
that
we
can
not
find
a
single
victim
of
these
alleged
outrages
to
speak
for
himself
subordinates
speak
for
him
porters
climb
up
ladders
to
him
but
he
himself
is
silent
ladies
and
gentlemen
i
propose
to
explain
on
the
spot
both
the
riddle
of
the
shots
and
the
riddle
of
the
silence
i
will
first
of
all
read
the
covering
letter
in
which
the
true
account
of
the
cambridge
incident
is
contained
and
then
that
document
itself
when
you
have
heard
both
there
will
be
no
doubt
about
your
decision
the
covering
letter
runs
as
follows
dear
sir
the
following
is
a
very
exact
and
even
vivid
account
of
the
incident
as
it
really
happened
at
brakespeare
college
we
the
undersigned
do
not
see
any
particular
reason
why
we
should
refer
it
to
any
isolated
authorship
the
truth
is
it
has
been
a
composite
production
and
we
have
even
had
some
difference
of
opinion
about
the
adjectives
but
every
word
of
it
is
we
are
yours
faithfully
wilfred
emerson
eames
warden
of
brakespeare
college
cambridge
innocent
smith
the
enclosed
statement
continued
inglewood
runs
as
follows
a
celebrated
english
university
backs
so
abruptly
on
the
river
that
it
has
so
to
speak
to
be
propped
up
and
patched
with
all
sorts
of
bridges
and
buildings
the
river
splits
itself
into
several
small
streams
and
canals
so
that
in
one
or
two
corners
the
place
has
almost
the
look
of
venice
it
was
so
especially
in
the
case
with
which
we
are
concerned
in
which
a
few
flying
buttresses
or
airy
ribs
of
stone
sprang
across
a
strip
of
water
to
connect
brakespeare
college
with
the
house
of
the
warden
of
brakespeare
the
country
around
these
colleges
is
flat
but
it
does
not
seem
flat
when
one
is
thus
in
the
midst
of
the
colleges
for
in
these
flat
fens
there
are
always
wandering
lakes
and
lingering
rivers
of
water
and
these
always
change
what
might
have
been
a
scheme
of
horizontal
lines
into
a
scheme
of
vertical
lines
wherever
there
is
water
the
height
of
high
buildings
is
doubled
and
a
british
brick
house
becomes
a
babylonian
tower
in
that
shining
unshaken
surface
the
houses
hang
head
downwards
exactly
to
their
highest
or
lowest
chimney
the
cloud
seen
in
that
abyss
is
as
far
below
the
world
as
its
original
appears
above
it
every
scrap
of
water
is
not
only
a
window
but
a
skylight
earth
splits
under
men
feet
into
precipitous
aerial
perspectives
into
which
a
bird
could
as
easily
wing
its
way
as
cyrus
pym
rose
in
protest
the
documents
he
had
put
in
evidence
had
been
confined
to
cold
affirmation
of
fact
the
defence
in
a
general
way
had
an
indubitable
right
to
put
their
case
in
their
own
way
but
all
this
landscape
gardening
seemed
to
him
cyrus
pym
to
be
not
up
to
the
business
will
the
leader
of
the
defence
tell
me
he
asked
how
it
can
possibly
affect
this
case
that
a
cloud
was
or
that
a
bird
could
have
winged
itself
anywhere
oh
i
do
know
said
michael
lifting
himself
lazily
you
see
you
do
know
yet
what
our
defence
is
till
you
know
that
do
you
see
anything
may
be
relevant
why
suppose
he
said
suddenly
as
if
an
idea
had
struck
him
suppose
we
wanted
to
prove
the
old
warden
suppose
he
was
shot
by
a
black
man
with
white
hair
when
he
thought
he
was
being
shot
by
a
white
man
with
yellow
hair
to
ascertain
if
that
cloud
was
really
and
truly
might
be
of
the
most
massive
importance
he
paused
with
a
seriousness
which
was
hardly
generally
shared
and
continued
with
the
same
fluency
or
suppose
we
wanted
to
maintain
that
the
warden
committed
suicide
that
he
just
got
smith
to
hold
the
pistol
as
brutus
slave
held
the
sword
why
it
would
make
all
the
difference
whether
the
warden
could
see
himself
plain
in
still
water
still
water
has
made
hundreds
of
suicides
one
sees
oneself
so
very
well
so
very
plain
do
you
perhaps
inquired
pym
with
austere
irony
maintain
that
your
client
was
a
bird
of
some
sort
say
a
flamingo
in
the
matter
of
his
being
a
flamingo
said
moon
with
sudden
severity
my
client
reserves
his
defence
no
one
quite
knowing
what
to
make
of
this
mr
moon
resumed
his
seat
and
inglewood
resumed
the
reading
of
his
document
there
is
something
pleasing
to
a
mystic
in
such
a
land
of
mirrors
for
a
mystic
is
one
who
holds
that
two
worlds
are
better
than
one
in
the
highest
sense
indeed
all
thought
is
reflection
this
is
the
real
truth
in
the
saying
that
second
thoughts
are
best
animals
have
no
second
thoughts
man
alone
is
able
to
see
his
own
thought
double
as
a
drunkard
sees
a
man
alone
is
able
to
see
his
own
thought
upside
down
as
one
sees
a
house
in
a
puddle
this
duplication
of
mentality
as
in
a
mirror
is
we
repeat
the
inmost
thing
of
human
philosophy
there
is
a
mystical
even
a
monstrous
truth
in
the
statement
that
two
heads
are
better
than
one
but
they
ought
both
to
grow
on
the
same
body
i
know
it
a
little
transcendental
at
first
interposed
inglewood
beaming
round
with
a
broad
apology
but
you
see
this
document
was
written
in
collaboration
by
a
don
and
a
drunkard
eh
suggested
moses
gould
beginning
to
enjoy
himself
i
rather
think
proceeded
inglewood
with
an
unruffled
and
critical
air
that
this
part
was
written
by
the
don
i
merely
warn
the
court
that
the
statement
though
indubitably
accurate
bears
here
and
there
the
trace
of
coming
from
two
authors
in
that
case
said
pym
leaning
back
and
sniffing
i
can
not
agree
with
them
that
two
heads
are
better
than
one
the
undersigned
persons
think
it
needless
to
touch
on
a
kindred
problem
so
often
discussed
at
committees
for
university
reform
the
question
of
whether
dons
see
double
because
they
are
drunk
or
get
drunk
because
they
see
double
it
is
enough
for
them
the
undersigned
persons
if
they
are
able
to
pursue
their
own
peculiar
and
profitable
theme
which
is
puddles
what
the
undersigned
persons
ask
themselves
is
a
puddle
a
puddle
repeats
infinity
and
is
full
of
light
nevertheless
if
analyzed
objectively
a
puddle
is
a
piece
of
dirty
water
spread
very
thin
on
mud
the
two
great
historic
universities
of
england
have
all
this
large
and
level
and
reflective
brilliance
nevertheless
or
rather
on
the
other
hand
they
are
puddles
puddles
puddles
puddles
puddles
the
undersigned
persons
ask
you
to
excuse
an
emphasis
inseparable
from
strong
conviction
inglewood
ignored
a
somewhat
wild
expression
on
the
faces
of
some
present
and
continued
with
eminent
cheerfulness
such
were
the
thoughts
that
failed
to
cross
the
mind
of
the
undergraduate
smith
as
he
picked
his
way
among
the
stripes
of
canal
and
the
glittering
rainy
gutters
into
which
the
water
broke
up
round
the
back
of
brakespeare
college
had
these
thoughts
crossed
his
mind
he
would
have
been
much
happier
than
he
was
unfortunately
he
did
not
know
that
his
puzzles
were
puddles
he
did
not
know
that
the
academic
mind
reflects
infinity
and
is
full
of
light
by
the
simple
process
of
being
shallow
and
standing
still
in
his
case
therefore
there
was
something
solemn
and
even
evil
about
the
infinity
implied
it
was
through
a
starry
night
of
bewildering
brilliancy
stars
were
both
above
and
below
to
young
smith
sullen
fancy
the
skies
below
seemed
even
hollower
than
the
skies
above
he
had
a
horrible
idea
that
if
he
counted
the
stars
he
would
find
one
too
many
in
the
pool
in
crossing
the
little
paths
and
bridges
he
felt
like
one
stepping
on
the
black
and
slender
ribs
of
some
cosmic
eiffel
tower
for
to
him
and
nearly
all
the
educated
youth
of
that
epoch
the
stars
were
cruel
things
though
they
glowed
in
the
great
dome
every
night
they
were
an
enormous
and
ugly
secret
they
uncovered
the
nakedness
of
nature
they
were
a
glimpse
of
the
iron
wheels
and
pulleys
behind
the
scenes
for
the
young
men
of
that
sad
time
thought
that
the
god
always
comes
from
the
machine
they
did
not
know
that
in
reality
the
machine
only
comes
from
the
god
in
short
they
were
all
pessimists
and
starlight
was
atrocious
to
them
atrocious
because
it
was
true
all
their
universe
was
black
with
white
spots
smith
looked
up
with
relief
from
the
glittering
pools
below
to
the
glittering
skies
and
the
great
black
bulk
of
the
college
the
only
light
other
than
stars
glowed
through
one
curtain
in
the
upper
part
of
the
building
marking
where
emerson
eames
always
worked
till
morning
and
received
his
friends
and
favourite
pupils
at
any
hour
of
the
night
indeed
it
was
to
his
rooms
that
the
melancholy
smith
was
bound
smith
had
been
at
eames
lecture
for
the
first
half
of
the
morning
and
at
pistol
practice
and
fencing
in
a
saloon
for
the
second
half
he
had
been
sculling
madly
for
the
first
half
of
the
afternoon
and
thinking
idly
and
still
more
madly
for
the
second
half
he
had
gone
to
a
supper
where
he
was
uproarious
and
on
to
a
debating
club
where
he
was
perfectly
insufferable
and
the
melancholy
smith
was
melancholy
still
then
as
he
was
going
home
to
his
diggings
he
remembered
the
eccentricity
of
his
friend
and
master
the
warden
of
brakespeare
and
resolved
desperately
to
turn
in
to
that
gentleman
private
house
emerson
eames
was
an
eccentric
in
many
ways
but
his
throne
in
philosophy
and
metaphysics
was
of
international
eminence
the
university
could
hardly
have
afforded
to
lose
him
and
moreover
a
don
has
only
to
continue
any
of
his
bad
habits
long
enough
to
make
them
a
part
of
the
british
constitution
the
bad
habits
of
emerson
eames
were
to
sit
up
all
night
and
to
be
a
student
of
schopenhauer
personally
he
was
a
lean
lounging
sort
of
man
with
a
blond
pointed
beard
not
so
very
much
older
than
his
pupil
smith
in
the
matter
of
mere
years
but
older
by
centuries
in
the
two
essential
respects
of
having
a
european
reputation
and
a
bald
head
came
against
the
rules
at
this
unearthly
hour
said
smith
who
was
nothing
to
the
eye
except
a
very
big
man
trying
to
make
himself
small
i
am
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
existence
is
really
too
rotten
i
know
all
the
arguments
of
the
thinkers
that
think
otherwise
bishops
and
agnostics
and
those
sort
of
people
and
knowing
you
were
the
greatest
living
authority
on
the
pessimist
thinkers
thinkers
said
eames
pessimist
thinkers
after
a
patch
of
pause
not
the
first
for
this
depressing
conversation
had
gone
on
for
some
hours
with
alternations
of
cynicism
and
silence
the
warden
continued
with
his
air
of
weary
brilliancy
all
a
question
of
wrong
calculation
the
moth
flies
into
the
candle
because
he
happen
to
know
that
the
game
is
not
worth
the
candle
the
wasp
gets
into
the
jam
in
hearty
and
hopeful
efforts
to
get
the
jam
into
him
in
the
same
way
the
vulgar
people
want
to
enjoy
life
just
as
they
want
to
enjoy
gin
because
they
are
too
stupid
to
see
that
they
are
paying
too
big
a
price
for
it
that
they
never
find
happiness
that
they
do
even
know
how
to
look
for
it
is
proved
by
the
paralyzing
clumsiness
and
ugliness
of
everything
they
do
their
discordant
colours
are
cries
of
pain
look
at
the
brick
villas
beyond
the
college
on
this
side
of
the
river
there
one
with
spotted
blinds
look
at
it
just
go
and
look
at
it
course
he
went
on
dreamily
or
two
men
see
the
sober
fact
a
long
way
off
they
go
mad
do
you
notice
that
maniacs
mostly
try
either
to
destroy
other
things
or
if
they
are
thoughtful
to
destroy
themselves
the
madman
is
the
man
behind
the
scenes
like
the
man
that
wanders
about
the
coulisse
of
a
theater
he
has
only
opened
the
wrong
door
and
come
into
the
right
place
he
sees
things
at
the
right
angle
but
the
common
world
hang
the
common
world
said
the
sullen
smith
letting
his
fist
fall
on
the
table
in
an
idle
despair
give
it
a
bad
name
first
said
the
professor
calmly
then
hang
it
a
puppy
with
hydrophobia
would
probably
struggle
for
life
while
we
killed
it
but
if
we
were
kind
we
should
kill
it
so
an
omniscient
god
would
put
us
out
of
our
pain
he
would
strike
us
dead
does
he
strike
us
dead
asked
the
undergraduate
abstractedly
plunging
his
hands
into
his
pockets
is
dead
himself
said
the
philosopher
is
where
he
is
really
enviable
any
one
who
thinks
proceeded
eames
pleasures
of
life
trivial
and
soon
tasteless
are
bribes
to
bring
us
into
a
torture
chamber
we
all
see
that
for
any
thinking
man
mere
extinction
is
the
what
are
you
doing
are
you
mad
put
that
thing
down
eames
had
turned
his
tired
but
still
talkative
head
over
his
shoulder
and
had
found
himself
looking
into
a
small
round
black
hole
rimmed
by
a
circlet
of
steel
with
a
sort
of
spike
standing
up
on
the
top
it
fixed
him
like
an
iron
eye
through
those
eternal
instants
during
which
the
reason
is
stunned
he
did
not
even
know
what
it
was
then
he
saw
behind
it
the
chambered
barrel
and
cocked
hammer
of
a
revolver
and
behind
that
the
flushed
and
rather
heavy
face
of
smith
apparently
quite
unchanged
or
even
more
mild
than
before
help
you
out
of
your
hole
old
man
said
smith
with
rough
tenderness
put
the
puppy
out
of
his
pain
emerson
eames
retreated
towards
the
window
you
mean
to
kill
me
he
cried
not
a
thing
i
do
for
every
one
said
smith
with
emotion
you
and
i
seem
to
have
got
so
intimate
somehow
i
know
all
your
troubles
now
and
the
only
cure
old
chap
that
thing
down
shouted
the
warden
soon
be
over
you
know
said
smith
with
the
air
of
a
sympathetic
dentist
and
as
the
warden
made
a
run
for
the
window
and
balcony
his
benefactor
followed
him
with
a
firm
step
and
a
compassionate
expression
both
men
were
perhaps
surprised
to
see
that
the
gray
and
white
of
early
daybreak
had
already
come
one
of
them
however
had
emotions
calculated
to
swallow
up
surprise
brakespeare
college
was
one
of
the
few
that
retained
real
traces
of
gothic
ornament
and
just
beneath
eames
balcony
there
ran
out
what
had
perhaps
been
a
flying
buttress
still
shapelessly
shaped
into
gray
beasts
and
devils
but
blinded
with
mosses
and
washed
out
with
rains
with
an
ungainly
and
most
courageous
leap
eames
sprang
out
on
this
antique
bridge
as
the
only
possible
mode
of
escape
from
the
maniac
he
sat
astride
of
it
still
in
his
academic
gown
dangling
his
long
thin
legs
and
considering
further
chances
of
flight
the
whitening
daylight
opened
under
as
well
as
over
him
that
impression
of
vertical
infinity
already
remarked
about
the
little
lakes
round
brakespeare
looking
down
and
seeing
the
spires
and
chimneys
pendent
in
the
pools
they
felt
alone
in
space
they
felt
as
if
they
were
looking
over
the
edge
from
the
north
pole
and
seeing
the
south
pole
below
the
world
we
said
observed
smith
the
world
is
hanged
he
has
hanged
the
world
upon
nothing
says
the
bible
do
you
like
being
hanged
upon
nothing
i
going
to
be
hanged
upon
something
myself
i
going
to
swing
for
you
dear
tender
old
phrase
he
murmured
true
till
this
moment
i
am
going
to
swing
for
you
for
you
dear
friend
for
your
sake
at
your
express
desire
cried
the
warden
of
brakespeare
college
puppy
struggles
said
the
undergraduate
with
an
eye
of
pity
poor
puppy
struggles
how
fortunate
it
is
that
i
am
wiser
and
kinder
than
he
and
he
sighted
his
weapon
so
as
exactly
to
cover
the
upper
part
of
eames
bald
head
said
the
philosopher
with
a
sudden
change
to
a
sort
of
ghastly
lucidity
shall
go
mad
so
look
at
things
from
the
right
angle
observed
smith
sighing
gently
but
madness
is
only
a
palliative
at
best
a
drug
the
only
cure
is
an
operation
an
operation
that
is
always
successful
death
as
he
spoke
the
sun
rose
it
seemed
to
put
colour
into
everything
with
the
rapidity
of
a
lightning
artist
a
fleet
of
little
clouds
sailing
across
the
sky
changed
from
to
pink
all
over
the
little
academic
town
the
tops
of
different
buildings
took
on
different
tints
here
the
sun
would
pick
out
the
green
enameled
on
a
pinnacle
there
the
scarlet
tiles
of
a
villa
here
the
copper
ornament
on
some
artistic
shop
and
there
the
slates
of
some
old
and
steep
church
roof
all
these
coloured
crests
seemed
to
have
something
oddly
individual
and
significant
about
them
like
crests
of
famous
knights
pointed
out
in
a
pageant
or
a
battlefield
they
each
arrested
the
eye
especially
the
rolling
eye
of
emerson
eames
as
he
looked
round
on
the
morning
and
accepted
it
as
his
last
through
a
narrow
chink
between
a
black
timber
tavern
and
a
big
gray
college
he
could
see
a
clock
with
gilt
hands
which
the
sunshine
set
on
fire
he
stared
at
it
as
though
hypnotized
and
suddenly
the
clock
began
to
strike
as
if
in
personal
reply
as
if
at
a
signal
clock
after
clock
took
up
the
cry
all
the
churches
awoke
like
chickens
at
cockcrow
the
birds
were
already
noisy
in
the
trees
behind
the
college
the
sun
rose
gathering
glory
that
seemed
too
full
for
the
deep
skies
to
hold
and
the
shallow
waters
beneath
them
seemed
golden
and
brimming
and
deep
enough
for
the
thirst
of
the
gods
just
round
the
corner
of
the
college
and
visible
from
his
crazy
perch
were
the
brightest
specks
on
that
bright
landscape
the
villa
with
the
spotted
blinds
which
he
had
made
his
text
that
night
he
wondered
for
the
first
time
what
people
lived
in
them
suddenly
he
called
out
with
mere
querulous
authority
as
he
might
have
called
to
a
student
to
shut
a
door
me
come
off
this
place
he
cried
ca
bear
it
rather
doubt
if
it
will
bear
you
said
smith
critically
before
you
break
your
neck
or
i
blow
out
your
brains
or
let
you
back
into
this
room
on
which
complex
points
i
am
undecided
i
want
the
metaphysical
point
cleared
up
do
i
understand
that
you
want
to
get
back
to
life
give
anything
to
get
back
replied
the
unhappy
professor
anything
cried
smith
blast
your
impudence
give
us
a
song
song
do
you
mean
demanded
the
exasperated
eames
song
hymn
i
think
would
be
most
appropriate
answered
the
other
gravely
let
you
off
if
you
repeat
after
me
the
words
thank
the
goodness
and
the
grace
that
on
my
birth
have
smiled
and
perched
me
on
this
curious
place
a
happy
english
child
emerson
eames
having
briefly
complied
his
persecutor
abruptly
told
him
to
hold
his
hands
up
in
the
air
vaguely
connecting
this
proceeding
with
the
usual
conduct
of
brigands
and
bushrangers
eames
held
them
up
very
stiffly
but
without
marked
surprise
a
bird
alighting
on
his
stone
seat
took
no
more
notice
of
him
than
of
a
comic
statue
are
now
engaged
in
public
worship
remarked
smith
severely
before
i
have
done
with
you
you
shall
thank
god
for
the
very
ducks
on
the
pond
the
celebrated
pessimist
half
articulately
expressed
his
perfect
readiness
to
thank
god
for
the
ducks
on
the
pond
forgetting
the
drakes
said
smith
sternly
eames
weakly
conceded
the
drakes
forgetting
anything
please
you
shall
thank
heaven
for
churches
and
chapels
and
villas
and
vulgar
people
and
puddles
and
pots
and
pans
and
sticks
and
rags
and
bones
and
spotted
blinds
right
all
right
repeated
the
victim
in
despair
and
rags
and
bones
and
blinds
blinds
i
think
we
said
remarked
smith
with
a
rogueish
ruthlessness
and
wagging
the
at
him
like
a
long
metallic
finger
blinds
said
emerson
eames
faintly
ca
say
fairer
than
that
admitted
the
younger
man
now
i
just
tell
you
this
to
wind
up
with
if
you
really
were
what
you
profess
to
be
i
do
see
that
it
would
matter
to
snail
or
seraph
if
you
broke
your
impious
stiff
neck
and
dashed
out
all
your
drivelling
brains
but
in
strict
biographical
fact
you
are
a
very
nice
fellow
addicted
to
talking
putrid
nonsense
and
i
love
you
like
a
brother
i
shall
therefore
fire
off
all
my
cartridges
round
your
head
so
as
not
to
hit
you
i
am
a
good
shot
you
may
be
glad
to
hear
and
then
we
will
go
in
and
have
some
breakfast
he
then
let
off
two
barrels
in
the
air
which
the
professor
endured
with
singular
firmness
and
then
said
do
fire
them
all
off
not
asked
the
other
buoyantly
them
asked
his
companion
the
next
man
you
meet
who
talks
as
we
were
talking
it
was
at
this
moment
that
smith
looking
down
perceived
apoplectic
terror
upon
the
face
of
the
and
heard
the
refined
shriek
with
which
he
summoned
the
porter
and
the
ladder
it
took
eames
some
little
time
to
disentangle
himself
from
the
ladder
and
some
little
time
longer
to
disentangle
himself
from
the
but
as
soon
as
he
could
do
so
unobtrusively
he
rejoined
his
companion
in
the
late
extraordinary
scene
he
was
astonished
to
find
the
gigantic
smith
heavily
shaken
and
sitting
with
his
shaggy
head
on
his
hands
when
addressed
he
lifted
a
very
pale
face
what
is
the
matter
asked
eames
whose
own
nerves
had
by
this
time
twittered
themselves
quiet
like
the
morning
birds
must
ask
your
indulgence
said
smith
rather
brokenly
must
ask
you
to
realize
that
i
have
just
had
an
escape
from
death
have
had
an
escape
from
death
repeated
the
professor
in
not
unpardonable
irritation
of
all
the
cheek
do
you
understand
do
you
understand
cried
the
pale
young
man
impatiently
had
to
do
it
eames
i
had
to
prove
you
wrong
or
die
when
a
man
young
he
nearly
always
has
some
one
whom
he
thinks
the
mark
of
the
mind
of
man
some
one
who
knows
all
about
it
if
anybody
knows
you
were
that
to
me
you
spoke
with
authority
and
not
as
the
scribes
nobody
could
comfort
me
if
you
said
there
was
no
comfort
if
you
really
thought
there
was
nothing
anywhere
it
was
because
you
had
been
there
to
see
do
you
see
that
i
had
to
prove
you
did
really
mean
it
or
else
drown
myself
in
the
canal
said
eames
hesitatingly
think
perhaps
you
confuse
do
tell
me
that
cried
smith
with
the
sudden
clairvoyance
of
mental
pain
tell
me
i
confuse
enjoyment
of
existence
with
the
will
to
live
that
german
and
german
is
high
dutch
and
high
dutch
is
double
dutch
the
thing
i
saw
shining
in
your
eyes
when
you
dangled
on
that
bridge
was
enjoyment
of
life
and
not
the
will
to
live
what
you
knew
when
you
sat
on
that
damned
gargoyle
was
that
the
world
when
all
is
said
and
done
is
a
wonderful
and
beautiful
place
i
know
it
because
i
knew
it
at
the
same
minute
i
saw
the
gray
clouds
turn
pink
and
the
little
gilt
clock
in
the
crack
between
the
houses
it
was
those
things
you
hated
leaving
not
life
whatever
that
is
eames
we
been
to
the
brink
of
death
together
wo
you
admit
i
right
said
eames
very
slowly
think
you
are
right
you
shall
have
a
first
cried
smith
springing
up
reanimated
passed
with
honours
and
now
let
me
go
and
see
about
being
sent
down
need
be
sent
down
said
eames
with
the
quiet
confidence
of
twelve
years
of
intrigue
with
us
comes
from
the
man
on
top
to
the
people
just
round
him
i
am
the
man
on
top
and
i
shall
tell
the
people
round
me
the
truth
the
massive
smith
rose
and
went
firmly
to
the
window
but
he
spoke
with
equal
firmness
must
be
sent
down
he
said
the
people
must
not
be
told
the
truth
why
not
asked
the
other
i
mean
to
follow
your
advice
answered
the
massive
youth
mean
to
keep
the
remaining
shots
for
people
in
the
shameful
state
you
and
i
were
in
last
night
i
wish
we
could
even
plead
drunkenness
i
mean
to
keep
those
bullets
for
pessimists
pills
for
pale
people
and
in
this
way
i
want
to
walk
the
world
like
a
wonderful
surprise
to
float
as
idly
as
the
thistledown
and
come
as
silently
as
the
sunrise
not
to
be
expected
any
more
than
the
thunderbolt
not
to
be
recalled
any
more
than
the
dying
breeze
i
do
want
people
to
anticipate
me
as
a
practical
joke
i
want
both
my
gifts
to
come
virgin
and
violent
the
death
and
the
life
after
death
i
am
going
to
hold
a
pistol
to
the
head
of
the
modern
man
but
i
shall
not
use
it
to
kill
him
only
to
bring
him
to
life
i
begin
to
see
a
new
meaning
in
being
the
skeleton
at
the
feast
can
scarcely
be
called
a
skeleton
said
eames
smiling
comes
of
being
so
much
at
the
feast
answered
the
massive
youth
skeleton
can
keep
his
figure
if
he
is
always
dining
out
but
that
is
not
quite
what
i
meant
what
i
mean
is
that
i
caught
a
kind
of
glimpse
of
the
meaning
of
death
and
all
that
the
skull
and
the
it
is
only
meant
to
remind
us
of
a
future
life
but
to
remind
us
of
a
present
life
too
with
our
weak
spirits
we
should
grow
old
in
eternity
if
we
were
not
kept
young
by
death
providence
has
to
cut
immortality
into
lengths
for
us
as
nurses
cut
the
bread
and
butter
into
fingers
then
he
added
suddenly
in
a
voice
of
unnatural
actuality
i
know
something
now
eames
i
knew
it
when
i
saw
the
clouds
turn
pink
do
you
mean
asked
eames
did
you
know
knew
for
the
first
time
that
murder
is
really
wrong
he
gripped
eames
hand
and
groped
his
way
somewhat
unsteadily
to
the
door
before
he
had
vanished
through
it
he
had
added
very
dangerous
though
when
a
man
thinks
for
a
split
second
that
he
understands
death
eames
remained
in
repose
and
rumination
some
hours
after
his
late
assailant
had
left
then
he
rose
took
his
hat
and
umbrella
and
went
for
a
brisk
if
rotatory
walk
several
times
however
he
stood
outside
the
villa
with
the
spotted
blinds
studying
them
intently
with
his
head
slightly
on
one
side
some
took
him
for
a
lunatic
and
some
for
an
intending
purchaser
he
is
not
yet
sure
that
the
two
characters
would
be
widely
different
the
above
narrative
has
been
constructed
on
a
principle
which
is
in
the
opinion
of
the

persons
new
in

art
of

each
of

innocent
smith
chapter
ii
the
two
curates
or
the
burglary
charge
arthur
inglewood
handed
the
document
he
had
just
read
to
the
leaders
of
the
prosecution
who
examined
it
with
their
heads
together
both
the
jew
and
the
american
were
of
sensitive
and
excitable
stocks
and
they
revealed
by
the
jumpings
and
bumpings
of
the
black
head
and
the
yellow
that
nothing
could
be
done
in
the
way
of
denial
of
the
document
the
letter
from
the
warden
was
as
authentic
as
the
letter
from
the
however
regrettably
different
in
dignity
and
social
tone
very
few
words
said
inglewood
are
required
to
conclude
our
case
in
this
matter
surely
it
is
now
plain
that
our
client
carried
his
pistol
about
with
the
eccentric
but
innocent
purpose
of
giving
a
wholesome
scare
to
those
whom
he
regarded
as
blasphemers
in
each
case
the
scare
was
so
wholesome
that
the
victim
himself
has
dated
from
it
as
from
a
new
birth
smith
so
far
from
being
a
madman
is
rather
a
mad
doctor
he
walks
the
world
curing
frenzies
and
not
distributing
them
that
is
the
answer
to
the
two
unanswerable
questions
which
i
put
to
the
prosecutors
that
is
why
they
dared
not
produce
a
line
by
any
one
who
had
actually
confronted
the
pistol
all
who
had
actually
confronted
the
pistol
confessed
that
they
had
profited
by
it
that
was
why
smith
though
a
good
shot
never
hit
anybody
he
never
hit
anybody
because
he
was
a
good
shot
his
mind
was
as
clear
of
murder
as
his
hands
are
of
blood
this
i
say
is
the
only
possible
explanation
of
these
facts
and
of
all
the
other
facts
no
one
can
possibly
explain
the
warden
conduct
except
by
believing
the
warden
story
even
pym
who
is
a
very
factory
of
ingenious
theories
could
find
no
other
theory
to
cover
the
case
there
are
promising
in
hypnotism
and
dual
personality
said
cyrus
pym
dreamily
the
science
of
criminology
is
in
its
infancy
and
infancy
cried
moon
jerking
his
red
pencil
in
the
air
with
a
gesture
of
enlightenment
why
that
explains
it
i
repeat
proceeded
inglewood
that
neither
pym
nor
any
one
else
can
account
on
any
other
theory
but
ours
for
the
warden
signature
for
the
shots
missed
and
the
witnesses
missing
the
little
yankee
had
slipped
to
his
feet
with
some
return
of
a
coolness
the
defence
he
said
omits
a
coldly
colossal
fact
they
say
we
produce
none
of
the
actual
victims
wal
here
is
one
victim
england
celebrated
and
stricken
warner
i
reckon
he
is
pretty
well
produced
and
they
suggest
that
all
the
outrages
were
followed
by
reconciliation
wal
there
no
flies
on
england
warner
and
he
is
reconciliated
much
my
learned
friend
said
moon
getting
elaborately
to
his
feet
must
remember
that
the
science
of
shooting
warner
is
in
its
infancy
warner
would
strike
the
idlest
eye
as
one
specially
difficult
to
startle
into
any
recognition
of
the
glory
of
god
we
admit
that
our
client
in
this
one
instance
failed
and
that
the
operation
was
not
successful
but
i
am
empowered
to
offer
on
behalf
of
my
client
a
proposal
for
operating
on
warner
again
at
his
earliest
convenience
and
without
further
fees
it
all
michael
cried
gould
quite
serious
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
you
might
give
us
a
bit
of
bally
sense
for
a
chinge
what
was
warner
talking
about
just
before
the
first
shot
asked
moon
sharply
the
creature
said
warner
superciliously
asked
me
with
characteristic
rationality
whether
it
was
my
birthday
and
you
answered
with
characteristic
swank
cried
moon
shooting
out
a
long
lean
finger
as
rigid
and
arresting
as
the
pistol
of
smith
that
you
did
keep
your
birthday
something
like
that
assented
the
doctor
then
continued
moon
he
asked
you
why
not
and
you
said
it
was
because
you
did
see
that
birth
was
anything
to
rejoice
over
agreed
now
is
there
any
one
who
doubts
that
our
tale
is
true
there
was
a
cold
crash
of
stillness
in
the
room
and
moon
said
pax
populi
vox
dei
it
is
the
silence
of
the
people
that
is
the
voice
of
god
or
in
pym
more
civilized
language
it
is
up
to
him
to
open
the
next
charge
on
this
we
claim
an
acquittal
it
was
about
an
hour
later
cyrus
pym
had
remained
for
an
unprecedented
time
with
his
eyes
closed
and
his
thumb
and
finger
in
the
air
it
almost
seemed
as
if
he
had
been
struck
so
as
the
nurses
say
and
in
the
deathly
silence
michael
moon
felt
forced
to
relieve
the
strain
with
some
remark
for
the
last
or
so
the
eminent
criminologist
had
been
explaining
that
science
took
the
same
view
of
offences
against
property
as
it
did
of
offences
against
life
most
murder
he
had
said
is
a
variation
of
homicidal
mania
and
in
the
same
way
most
theft
is
a
version
of
kleptomania
i
can
not
entertain
any
doubt
that
my
learned
friends
opposite
adequately
how
this
must
involve
a
scheme
of
punishment
more
and
humane
than
the
cruel
methods
of
ancient
codes
they
will
doubtless
exhibit
consciousness
of
a
chasm
so
eminently
yawning
so
so
it
was
here
that
he
paused
and
indulged
in
the
delicate
gesture
to
which
allusion
has
been
made
and
michael
could
bear
it
no
longer
yes
yes
he
said
impatiently
we
admit
the
chasm
the
old
cruel
codes
accuse
a
man
of
theft
and
send
him
to
prison
for
ten
years
the
tolerant
and
humane
ticket
accuses
him
of
nothing
and
sends
him
to
prison
for
ever
we
pass
the
chasm
it
was
characteristic
of
the
eminent
pym
in
one
of
his
trances
of
verbal
fastidiousness
that
he
went
on
unconscious
not
only
of
his
opponent
interruption
but
even
of
his
own
pause
so
continued
cyrus
pym
so
fraught
with
real
high
hopes
of
the
future
science
therefore
regards
thieves
in
the
abstract
just
as
it
regards
murderers
it
regards
them
not
as
sinners
to
be
punished
for
an
arbitrary
period
but
as
patients
to
be
detained
and
cared
for
his
first
two
digits
closed
again
as
he
hesitated
in
short
for
the
required
period
but
there
is
something
special
in
the
case
we
investigate
here
kleptomania
commonly
itself
i
beg
pardon
said
michael
i
did
not
ask
just
now
because
to
tell
the
truth
i
really
thought
pym
though
seemingly
vertical
was
enjoying
slumber
with
a
pinch
in
his
fingers
of
scentless
and
delicate
dust
but
now
that
things
are
moving
a
little
more
there
is
something
i
should
really
like
to
know
i
have
hung
on
pym
lips
of
course
with
an
interest
that
it
were
weak
to
call
rapture
but
i
have
so
far
been
unable
to
form
any
conjecture
about
what
the
accused
in
the
present
instance
is
supposed
to
have
been
and
gone
and
done
if
mr
moon
will
have
patience
said
pym
with
dignity
he
will
find
that
this
was
the
very
point
to
which
my
exposition
was
kleptomania
i
say
exhibits
itself
as
a
kind
of
physical
attraction
to
certain
defined
materials
and
it
has
been
held
by
no
less
a
man
than
harris
that
this
is
the
ultimate
explanation
of
the
strict
specialism
and
vurry
narrow
professional
outlook
of
most
criminals
one
will
have
an
irresistible
physical
impulsion
towards
pearl
while
he
passes
over
the
most
elegant
and
celebrated
diamond
placed
about
in
the
most
conspicuous
locations
another
will
impede
his
flight
with
no
less
than
buttoned
boots
while
boots
leave
him
cold
and
even
sarcastic
the
specialism
of
the
criminal
i
repeat
is
a
mark
rather
of
insanity
than
of
any
brightness
of
business
habits
but
there
is
one
kind
of
depredator
to
whom
this
principle
is
at
first
sight
hard
to
apply
i
allude
to
our
the
housebreaker
it
has
been
maintained
by
some
of
our
boldest
young
that
the
eye
of
a
burglar
beyond
the
wall
could
hardly
be
caught
and
hypnotized
by
a
fork
that
is
insulated
in
a
locked
box
under
the
butler
bed
they
have
thrown
down
the
gauntlet
to
american
science
on
this
point
they
declare
that
diamond
links
are
not
left
about
in
conspicuous
locations
in
the
haunts
of
the
lower
classes
as
they
were
in
the
great
test
experiment
of
calypso
college
we
hope
this
experiment
here
will
be
an
answer
to
that
young
ringing
challenge
and
will
bring
the
burglar
once
more
into
line
and
union
with
his
fellow
criminals
moon
whose
face
had
gone
through
every
phase
of
black
bewilderment
for
five
minutes
past
suddenly
lifted
his
hand
and
struck
the
table
in
explosive
enlightenment
oh
i
see
he
cried
you
mean
that
smith
is
a
burglar
i
thought
i
made
it
quite
lucid
said
pym
folding
up
his
eyelids
it
was
typical
of
this
private
trial
that
all
the
eloquent
extras
all
the
rhetoric
or
digression
on
either
side
was
exasperating
and
unintelligible
to
the
other
moon
could
not
make
head
or
tail
of
the
solemnity
of
a
new
civilization
pym
could
not
make
head
or
tail
of
the
gaiety
of
an
old
one
all
the
cases
in
which
smith
has
figured
as
an
expropriator
continued
the
american
doctor
are
cases
of
burglary
pursuing
the
same
course
as
in
the
previous
case
we
select
the
indubitable
instance
from
the
rest
and
we
take
the
most
correct
evidence
i
will
now
call
on
my
colleague
gould
to
read
a
letter
we
have
received
from
the
earnest
unspotted
canon
of
durham
canon
hawkins
moses
gould
leapt
up
with
his
usual
alacrity
to
read
the
letter
from
the
earnest
and
unspotted
hawkins
moses
gould
could
imitate
a
farmyard
well
sir
henry
irving
not
so
well
marie
lloyd
to
a
point
of
excellence
and
the
new
motor
horns
in
a
manner
that
put
him
upon
the
platform
of
great
artists
but
his
imitation
of
a
canon
of
durham
was
not
convincing
indeed
the
sense
of
the
letter
was
so
much
obscured
by
the
extraordinary
leaps
and
gasps
of
his
pronunciation
that
it
is
perhaps
better
to
print
it
here
as
moon
read
it
when
a
little
later
it
was
handed
across
the
table
dear
sir
i
can
scarcely
feel
surprise
that
the
incident
you
mention
private
as
it
was
should
have
filtered
through
our
omnivorous
journals
to
the
mere
populace
for
the
position
i
have
since
attained
makes
me
i
conceive
a
public
character
and
this
was
certainly
the
most
extraordinary
incident
in
a
not
uneventful
and
perhaps
not
an
unimportant
career
i
am
by
no
means
without
experience
in
scenes
of
civil
tumult
i
have
faced
many
a
political
crisis
in
the
old
primrose
league
days
at
herne
bay
and
before
i
broke
with
the
wilder
set
have
spent
many
a
night
at
the
christian
social
union
but
this
other
experience
was
quite
inconceivable
i
can
only
describe
it
as
the
letting
loose
of
a
place
which
it
is
not
for
me
as
a
clergyman
to
mention
it
occurred
in
the
days
when
i
was
for
a
short
period
a
curate
at
hoxton
and
the
other
curate
then
my
colleague
induced
me
to
attend
a
meeting
which
he
described
i
must
say
profanely
described
as
calculated
to
promote
the
kingdom
of
god
i
found
on
the
contrary
that
it
consisted
entirely
of
men
in
corduroys
and
greasy
clothes
whose
manners
were
coarse
and
their
opinions
extreme
of
my
colleague
in
question
i
wish
to
speak
with
the
fullest
respect
and
friendliness
and
i
will
therefore
say
little
no
one
can
be
more
convinced
than
i
of
the
evil
of
politics
in
the
pulpit
and
i
never
offer
my
congregation
any
advice
about
voting
except
in
cases
in
which
i
feel
strongly
that
they
are
likely
to
make
an
erroneous
selection
but
while
i
do
not
mean
to
touch
at
all
upon
political
or
social
problems
i
must
say
that
for
a
clergyman
to
countenance
even
in
jest
such
discredited
nostrums
of
dissipated
demagogues
as
socialism
or
radicalism
partakes
of
the
character
of
the
betrayal
of
a
sacred
trust
far
be
it
from
me
to
say
a
word
against
the
reverend
raymond
percy
the
colleague
in
question
he
was
brilliant
i
suppose
and
to
some
apparently
fascinating
but
a
clergyman
who
talks
like
a
socialist
wears
his
hair
like
a
pianist
and
behaves
like
an
intoxicated
person
will
never
rise
in
his
profession
or
even
obtain
the
admiration
of
the
good
and
wise
nor
is
it
for
me
to
utter
my
personal
judgements
of
the
appearance
of
the
people
in
the
hall
yet
a
glance
round
the
room
revealing
ranks
of
debased
and
envious
faces
adopting
said
moon
explosively
for
he
was
getting
restive
adopting
the
reverend
gentleman
favourite
figure
of
logic
may
i
say
that
while
tortures
would
not
tear
from
me
a
whisper
about
his
intellect
he
is
a
blasted
old
jackass
really
said
pym
i
protest
you
must
keep
quiet
michael
said
inglewood
they
have
a
right
to
read
their
story
chair
chair
chair
cried
gould
rolling
about
exuberantly
in
his
own
and
pym
glanced
for
a
moment
towards
the
canopy
which
covered
all
the
authority
of
the
court
of
beacon
oh
do
wake
the
old
lady
said
moon
lowering
his
voice
in
a
moody
i
apologize
i
wo
interrupt
again
before
the
little
eddy
of
interruption
was
ended
the
reading
of
the
clergyman
letter
was
already
continuing
the
proceedings
opened
with
a
speech
from
my
colleague
of
which
i
will
say
nothing
it
was
deplorable
many
of
the
audience
were
irish
and
showed
the
weakness
of
that
impetuous
people
when
gathered
together
into
gangs
and
conspiracies
they
seem
to
lose
altogether
that
lovable
and
readiness
to
accept
anything
one
tells
them
which
distinguishes
them
as
individuals
with
a
slight
start
michael
rose
to
his
feet
bowed
solemnly
and
sat
down
again
these
persons
if
not
silent
were
at
least
applausive
during
the
speech
of
percy
he
descended
to
their
level
with
witticisms
about
rent
and
a
reserve
of
labour
confiscation
expropriation
arbitration
and
such
words
with
which
i
can
not
soil
my
lips
recurred
constantly
some
hours
afterward
the
storm
broke
i
had
been
addressing
the
meeting
for
some
time
pointing
out
the
lack
of
thrift
in
the
working
classes
their
insufficient
attendance
at
evening
service
their
neglect
of
the
harvest
festival
and
of
many
other
things
that
might
materially
help
them
to
improve
their
lot
it
was
i
think
about
this
time
that
an
extraordinary
interruption
occurred
an
enormous
powerful
man
partly
concealed
with
white
plaster
arose
in
the
middle
of
the
hall
and
offered
in
a
loud
roaring
voice
like
a
bull
some
observations
which
seemed
to
be
in
a
foreign
language
raymond
percy
my
colleague
descended
to
his
level
by
entering
into
a
duel
of
repartee
in
which
he
appeared
to
be
the
victor
the
meeting
began
to
behave
more
respectfully
for
a
little
yet
before
i
had
said
twelve
sentences
more
the
rush
was
made
for
the
platform
the
enormous
plasterer
in
particular
plunged
towards
us
shaking
the
earth
like
an
elephant
and
i
really
do
not
know
what
would
have
happened
if
a
man
equally
large
but
not
quite
so
had
not
jumped
up
also
and
held
him
away
this
other
big
man
shouted
a
sort
of
speech
to
the
mob
as
he
was
shoving
them
back
i
do
know
what
he
said
but
what
with
shouting
and
shoving
and
such
horseplay
he
got
us
out
at
a
back
door
while
the
wretched
people
went
roaring
down
another
passage
then
follows
the
truly
extraordinary
part
of
my
story
when
he
had
got
us
outside
in
a
mean
backyard
of
blistered
grass
leading
into
a
lane
with
a
very
this
giant
addressed
me
as
follows
well
out
of
that
sir
now
you
better
come
along
with
me
i
want
you
to
help
me
in
an
act
of
social
justice
such
as
we
all
been
talking
about
come
along
and
turning
his
big
back
abruptly
he
led
us
down
the
lean
old
lane
with
the
one
lean
old
we
scarcely
knowing
what
to
do
but
to
follow
him
he
had
certainly
helped
us
in
a
most
difficult
situation
and
as
a
gentleman
i
could
not
treat
such
a
benefactor
with
suspicion
without
grave
grounds
such
also
was
the
view
of
my
socialistic
colleague
who
with
all
his
dreadful
talk
of
arbitration
is
a
gentleman
also
in
fact
he
comes
of
the
staffordshire
percys
a
branch
of
the
old
house
and
has
the
black
hair
and
pale
face
of
the
whole
family
i
can
not
but
refer
it
to
vanity
that
he
should
heighten
his
personal
advantages
with
black
velvet
or
a
red
cross
of
considerable
ostentation
and
certainly
but
i
digress
a
fog
was
coming
up
the
street
and
that
last
lost
faded
behind
us
in
a
way
that
certainly
depressed
the
mind
the
large
man
in
front
of
us
looked
larger
and
larger
in
the
haze
he
did
not
turn
round
but
he
said
with
his
huge
back
to
us
that
talking
no
good
we
want
a
little
practical
socialism
quite
agree
said
percy
i
always
like
to
understand
things
in
theory
before
i
put
them
into
practice
you
just
leave
that
to
me
said
the
practical
socialist
or
whatever
he
was
with
the
most
terrifying
vagueness
have
a
way
with
me
i
a
permeator
i
could
not
imagine
what
he
meant
but
my
companion
laughed
so
i
was
sufficiently
reassured
to
continue
the
unaccountable
journey
for
the
present
it
led
us
through
most
singular
ways
out
of
the
lane
where
we
were
already
rather
cramped
into
a
paved
passage
at
the
end
of
which
we
passed
through
a
wooden
gate
left
open
we
then
found
ourselves
in
the
increasing
darkness
and
vapour
crossing
what
appeared
to
be
a
beaten
path
across
a
kitchen
garden
i
called
out
to
the
enormous
person
going
on
in
front
but
he
answered
obscurely
that
it
was
a
short
cut
i
was
just
repeating
my
very
natural
doubt
to
my
clerical
companion
when
i
was
brought
up
against
a
short
ladder
apparently
leading
to
a
higher
level
of
road
my
thoughtless
colleague
ran
up
it
so
quickly
that
i
could
not
do
otherwise
than
follow
as
best
i
could
the
path
on
which
i
then
planted
my
feet
was
quite
unprecedentedly
narrow
i
had
never
had
to
walk
along
a
thoroughfare
so
exiguous
along
one
side
of
it
grew
what
in
the
dark
and
density
of
air
i
first
took
to
be
some
short
strong
thicket
of
shrubs
then
i
saw
that
they
were
not
short
shrubs
they
were
the
tops
of
tall
trees
i
an
english
gentleman
and
clergyman
of
the
church
of
england
i
was
walking
along
the
top
of
a
garden
wall
like
a
tom
cat
i
am
glad
to
say
that
i
stopped
within
my
first
five
steps
and
let
loose
my
just
reprobation
balancing
myself
as
best
i
could
all
the
time
a
declared
my
indefensible
informant
closed
to
traffic
once
in
a
hundred
years
percy
mr
percy
i
called
out
are
not
going
on
with
this
blackguard
i
think
so
answered
my
unhappy
colleague
flippantly
think
you
and
i
are
bigger
blackguards
than
he
is
whatever
he
is
am
a
burglar
explained
the
big
creature
quite
calmly
am
a
member
of
the
fabian
society
i
take
back
the
wealth
stolen
by
the
capitalist
not
by
sweeping
civil
war
and
revolution
but
by
reform
fitted
to
the
special
occasion
here
a
little
and
there
a
little
do
you
see
that
fifth
house
along
the
terrace
with
the
flat
roof
i
permeating
that
one
this
is
a
crime
or
a
joke
i
cried
desire
to
be
quit
of
it
ladder
is
just
behind
you
answered
the
creature
with
horrible
courtesy
before
you
go
do
let
me
give
you
my
card
if
i
had
had
the
presence
of
mind
to
show
any
proper
spirit
i
should
have
flung
it
away
though
any
adequate
gesture
of
the
kind
would
have
gravely
affected
my
equilibrium
upon
the
wall
as
it
was
in
the
wildness
of
the
moment
i
put
it
in
my
waistcoat
pocket
and
picking
my
way
back
by
wall
and
ladder
landed
in
the
respectable
streets
once
more
not
before
however
i
had
seen
with
my
own
eyes
the
two
awful
and
lamentable
facts
that
the
burglar
was
climbing
up
a
slanting
roof
towards
the
chimneys
and
that
raymond
percy
a
priest
of
god
and
what
was
worse
a
gentleman
was
crawling
up
after
him
i
have
never
seen
either
of
them
since
that
day
in
consequence
of
this
experience
i
severed
my
connection
with
the
wild
set
i
am
far
from
saying
that
every
member
of
the
christian
social
union
must
necessarily
be
a
burglar
i
have
no
right
to
bring
any
such
charge
but
it
gave
me
a
hint
of
what
such
courses
may
lead
to
in
many
cases
and
i
saw
them
no
more
i
have
only
to
add
that
the
photograph
you
enclose
taken
by
a
inglewood
is
undoubtedly
that
of
the
burglar
in
question
when
i
got
home
that
night
i
looked
at
his
card
and
he
was
inscribed
there
under
the
name
of
innocent
yours
faithfully
john
clement
hawkins
moon
merely
went
through
the
form
of
glancing
at
the
paper
he
knew
that
the
prosecutors
could
not
have
invented
so
heavy
a
document
that
moses
gould
for
one
could
no
more
write
like
a
canon
than
he
could
read
like
one
after
handing
it
back
he
rose
to
open
the
defence
on
the
burglary
charge
we
wish
said
michael
to
give
all
reasonable
facilities
to
the
prosecution
especially
as
it
will
save
the
time
of
the
whole
court
the
latter
object
i
shall
once
again
pursue
by
passing
over
all
those
points
of
theory
which
are
so
dear
to
pym
i
know
how
they
are
made
perjury
is
a
variety
of
aphasia
leading
a
man
to
say
one
thing
instead
of
another
forgery
is
a
kind
of
writer
cramp
forcing
a
man
to
write
his
uncle
name
instead
of
his
own
piracy
on
the
high
seas
is
probably
a
form
of
but
it
is
unnecessary
for
us
to
inquire
into
the
causes
of
a
fact
which
we
deny
innocent
smith
never
did
commit
burglary
at
all
i
should
like
to
claim
the
power
permitted
by
our
previous
arrangement
and
ask
the
prosecution
two
or
three
questions
cyrus

michael
canon
hawkins
in
his
boyish
way
left
off
at
the
exciting
moment
why
do
you
produce
the
evidence
of
the
other
clergyman
who
actually
followed
the
burglar
and
presumably
was
present
at
the
crime
pym
rose
and
planted
the
points
of
his
fingers
on
the
table
as
he
did
when
he
was
specially
confident
of
the
clearness
of
his
reply
we
have
entirely
failed
he
said
to
track
the
other
clergyman
who
seems
to
have
melted
into
the
ether
after
canon
hawkins
had
seen
him
the
gutters
and
the
leads
i
am
fully
aware
that
this
may
strike
many
as
yet
upon
reflection
i
think
it
will
appear
pretty
natural
to
a
bright
thinker
this
raymond
percy
is
admittedly
by
the
canon
evidence
a
minister
of
eccentric
ways
his
with
england
proudest
and
fairest
does
not
seemingly
prevent
a
taste
for
the
society
of
the
real
on
the
other
hand
the
prisoner
smith
is
by
general
agreement
a
man
of
fascination
i
entertain
no
doubt
that
smith
led
the
revered
percy
into
the
crime
and
forced
him
to
hide
his
head
in
the
real
class
that
would
fully
account
for
his
and
the
failure
of
all
attempts
to
trace
him
it
is
impossible
then
to
trace
him
asked

impossible
repeated
the

shutting

it

oh

arthur
directed
michael

sitting
down
kindly
read
raymond
percy
letter
to
the
court
wishing
as
mr
moon
has
said
to
shorten
the
proceedings
as
much
as
possible
began
inglewood
i
will
not
read
the
first
part
of
the
letter
sent
to
us
it
is
only
fair
to
the
prosecution
to
admit
the
account
given
by
the
second
clergyman
fully
ratifies
as
far
as
facts
are
concerned
that
given
by
the
first
clergyman
we
concede
then
the
canon
story
so
far
as
it
goes
this
must
necessarily
be
valuable
to
the
prosecutor
and
also
convenient
to
the
court
i
begin
percy
letter
then
at
the
point
when
all
three
men
were
standing
on
the
garden
wall
as
i
watched
hawkins
wavering
on
the
wall
i
made
up
my
own
mind
not
to
waver
a
cloud
of
wrath
was
on
my
brain
like
the
cloud
of
copper
fog
on
the
houses
and
gardens
round
my
decision
was
violent
and
simple
yet
the
thoughts
that
led
up
to
it
were
so
complicated
and
contradictory
that
i
could
not
retrace
them
now
i
knew
hawkins
was
a
kind
innocent
gentleman
and
i
would
have
given
ten
pounds
for
the
pleasure
of
kicking
him
down
the
road
that
god
should
allow
good
people
to
be
as
bestially
stupid
as
that
rose
against
me
like
a
towering
blasphemy
at
oxford
i
fear
i
had
the
artistic
temperament
rather
badly
and
artists
love
to
be
limited
i
liked
the
church
as
a
pretty
pattern
discipline
was
mere
decoration
i
delighted
in
mere
divisions
of
time
i
liked
eating
fish
on
friday
but
then
i
like
fish
and
the
fast
was
made
for
men
who
like
meat
then
i
came
to
hoxton
and
found
men
who
had
fasted
for
five
hundred
years
men
who
had
to
gnaw
fish
because
they
could
not
get
meat
and
when
they
could
not
get
fish
as
too
many
british
officers
treat
the
army
as
a
review
so
i
had
treated
the
church
militant
as
if
it
were
the
church
pageant
hoxton
cures
that
then
i
realized
that
for
eighteen
hundred
years
the
church
militant
had
not
been
a
pageant
but
a
riot
and
a
suppressed
riot
there
still
living
patiently
in
hoxton
were
the
people
to
whom
the
tremendous
promises
had
been
made
in
the
face
of
that
i
had
to
become
a
revolutionary
if
i
was
to
continue
to
be
religious
in
hoxton
one
can
not
be
a
conservative
without
being
also
an
atheist
and
a
pessimist
nobody
but
the
devil
could
want
to
conserve
hoxton
on
the
top
of
all
this
comes
hawkins
if
he
had
cursed
all
the
hoxton
men
excommunicated
them
and
told
them
they
were
going
to
hell
i
should
have
rather
admired
him
if
he
had
ordered
them
all
to
be
burned
in
the
i
should
still
have
had
that
patience
that
all
good
christians
have
with
the
wrongs
inflicted
on
other
people
but
there
is
no
priestcraft
about
hawkins
nor
any
other
kind
of
craft
he
is
as
perfectly
incapable
of
being
a
priest
as
he
is
of
being
a
carpenter
or
a
cabman
or
a
gardener
or
a
plasterer
he
is
a
perfect
gentleman
that
is
his
complaint
he
does
not
impose
his
creed
but
simply
his
class
he
never
said
a
word
of
religion
in
the
whole
of
his
damnable
address
he
simply
said
all
the
things
his
brother
the
major
would
have
said
a
voice
from
heaven
assures
me
that
he
has
a
brother
and
that
this
brother
is
a
major
when
this
helpless
aristocrat
had
praised
cleanliness
in
the
body
and
convention
in
the
soul
to
people
who
could
hardly
keep
body
and
soul
together
the
stampede
against
our
platform
began
i
took
part
in
his
undeserved
rescue
i
followed
his
obscure
deliverer
until
as
i
have
said
we
stood
together
on
the
wall
above
the
dim
gardens
already
clouding
with
fog
then
i
looked
at
the
curate
and
at
the
burglar
and
decided
in
a
spasm
of
inspiration
that
the
burglar
was
the
better
man
of
the
two
the
burglar
seemed
quite
as
kind
and
human
as
the
curate
was
and
he
was
also
brave
and
which
the
curate
was
not
i
knew
there
was
no
virtue
in
the
upper
class
for
i
belong
to
it
myself
i
knew
there
was
not
so
very
much
in
the
lower
class
for
i
had
lived
with
it
a
long
time
many
old
texts
about
the
despised
and
persecuted
came
back
to
my
mind
and
i
thought
that
the
saints
might
well
be
hidden
in
the
criminal
class
about
the
time
hawkins
let
himself
down
the
ladder
i
was
crawling
up
a
low
sloping
roof
after
the
large
man
who
went
leaping
in
front
of
me
like
a
gorilla
this
upward
scramble
was
short
and
we
soon
found
ourselves
tramping
along
a
broad
road
of
flat
roofs
broader
than
many
big
thoroughfares
with
here
and
there
that
seemed
in
the
haze
as
bulky
as
small
forts
the
asphyxiation
of
the
fog
seemed
to
increase
the
somewhat
swollen
and
morbid
anger
under
which
my
brain
and
body
laboured
the
sky
and
all
those
things
that
are
commonly
clear
seemed
overpowered
by
sinister
spirits
tall
spectres
with
turbans
of
vapour
seemed
to
stand
higher
than
the
sun
or
moon
eclipsing
both
i
thought
dimly
of
illustrations
to
the
on
brown
paper
with
rich
but
sombre
tints
showing
genii
gathering
round
the
seal
of
solomon
by
the
way
what
was
the
seal
of
solomon
nothing
to
do
with
really
i
suppose
but
my
muddled
fancy
felt
the
thick
clouds
as
being
of
that
heavy
and
clinging
substance
of
strong
opaque
colour
poured
out
of
boiling
pots
and
stamped
into
monstrous
emblems
the
first
effect
of
the
tall
turbaned
vapours
was
that
discoloured
look
of
or
coffee
brown
of
which
londoners
commonly
speak
but
the
scene
grew
subtler
with
familiarity
we
stood
above
the
average
of
the
housetops
and
saw
something
of
that
thing
called
smoke
which
in
great
cities
creates
the
strange
thing
called
fog
beneath
us
rose
a
forest
of
and
there
stood
in
every
as
if
it
were
a
a
brief
shrub
or
a
tall
tree
of
coloured
vapour
the
colours
of
the
smoke
were
various
for
some
chimneys
were
from
firesides
and
some
from
factories
and
some
again
from
mere
rubbish
heaps
and
yet
though
the
tints
were
all
varied
they
all
seemed
unnatural
like
fumes
from
a
witch
pot
it
was
as
if
the
shameful
and
ugly
shapes
growing
shapeless
in
the
cauldron
sent
up
each
its
separate
spurt
of
steam
coloured
according
to
the
fish
or
flesh
consumed
here
aglow
from
underneath
were
dark
red
clouds
such
as
might
drift
from
dark
jars
of
sacrificial
blood
there
the
vapour
was
dark
indigo
gray
like
the
long
hair
of
witches
steeped
in
the
in
another
place
the
smoke
was
of
an
awful
opaque
ivory
yellow
such
as
might
be
the
disembodiment
of
one
of
their
old
leprous
waxen
images
but
right
across
it
ran
a
line
of
bright
sinister
sulphurous
green
as
clear
and
crooked
as
arabic
moses
gould
once
more
attempted
the
arrest
of
the
he
was
understood
to
suggest
that
the
reader
should
shorten
the
proceedings
by
leaving
out
all
the
adjectives
duke
who
had
woken
up
observed
that
she
was
sure
it
was
all
very
nice
and
the
decision
was
duly
noted
down
by
moses
with
a
blue
and
by
michael
with
a
red
pencil
inglewood
then
resumed
the
reading
of
the
document
then
i
read
the
writing
of
the
smoke
smoke
was
like
the
modern
city
that
makes
it
it
is
not
always
dull
or
ugly
but
it
is
always
wicked
and
vain
modern
england
was
like
a
cloud
of
smoke
it
could
carry
all
colours
but
it
could
leave
nothing
but
a
stain
it
was
our
weakness
and
not
our
strength
that
put
a
rich
refuse
in
the
sky
these
were
the
rivers
of
our
vanity
pouring
into
the
void
we
had
taken
the
sacred
circle
of
the
whirlwind
and
looked
down
on
it
and
seen
it
as
a
whirlpool
and
then
we
had
used
it
as
a
sink
it
was
a
good
symbol
of
the
mutiny
in
my
own
mind
only
our
worst
things
were
going
to
heaven
only
our
criminals
could
still
ascend
like
angels
as
my
brain
was
blinded
with
such
emotions
my
guide
stopped
by
one
of
the
big
that
stood
at
the
regular
intervals
like
along
that
uplifted
and
aerial
highway
he
put
his
heavy
hand
upon
it
and
for
the
moment
i
thought
he
was
merely
leaning
on
it
tired
with
his
steep
scramble
along
the
terrace
so
far
as
i
could
guess
from
the
abysses
full
of
fog
on
either
side
and
the
veiled
lights
of
red
brown
and
old
gold
glowing
through
them
now
and
again
we
were
on
the
top
of
one
of
those
long
consecutive
and
genteel
rows
of
houses
which
are
still
to
be
found
lifting
their
heads
above
poorer
districts
the
remains
of
some
rage
of
optimism
in
earlier
speculative
builders
probably
enough
they
were
entirely
untenanted
or
tenanted
only
by
such
small
clans
of
the
poor
as
gather
also
in
the
old
emptied
palaces
of
italy
indeed
some
little
time
later
when
the
fog
had
lifted
a
little
i
discovered
that
we
were
walking
round
a
of
crescent
which
fell
away
below
us
into
one
flat
square
or
wide
street
below
another
like
a
giant
stairway
in
a
manner
not
unknown
in
the
eccentric
building
of
london
and
looking
like
the
last
ledges
of
the
land
but
a
cloud
sealed
the
giant
stairway
as
yet
my
speculations
about
the
sullen
skyscape
however
were
interrupted
by
something
as
unexpected
as
the
moon
falling
from
the
sky
instead
of
my
burglar
lifting
his
hand
from
the
chimney
he
leaned
on
he
leaned
on
it
a
little
more
heavily
and
the
whole
turned
over
like
the
opening
top
of
an
inkstand
i
remembered
the
short
ladder
leaning
against
the
low
wall
and
felt
sure
he
had
arranged
his
criminal
approach
long
before
the
collapse
of
the
big
ought
to
have
been
the
culmination
of
my
chaotic
feelings
but
to
tell
the
truth
it
produced
a
sudden
sense
of
comedy
and
even
of
comfort
i
could
not
recall
what
connected
this
abrupt
bit
of
housebreaking
with
some
quaint
but
still
kindly
fancies
then
i
remembered
the
delightful
and
uproarious
scenes
of
roofs
and
chimneys
in
the
harlequinades
of
my
childhood
and
was
darkly
and
quite
irrationally
comforted
by
a
sense
of
unsubstantiality
in
the
scene
as
if
the
houses
were
of
lath
and
paint
and
pasteboard
and
were
only
meant
to
be
tumbled
in
and
out
of
by
policemen
and
pantaloons
the
of
my
companion
seemed
not
only
seriously
excusable
but
even
comically
excusable
who
were
all
these
pompous
preposterous
people
with
their
footmen
and
their
their
and
their
hats
that
they
should
prevent
a
poor
clown
from
getting
sausages
if
he
wanted
them
one
would
suppose
that
property
was
a
serious
thing
i
had
reached
as
it
were
a
higher
level
of
that
mountainous
and
vapourous
visions
the
heaven
of
a
higher
levity
my
guide
had
jumped
down
into
the
dark
cavity
revealed
by
the
displaced
he
must
have
landed
at
a
level
considerably
lower
for
tall
as
he
was
nothing
but
his
weirdly
tousled
head
remained
visible
something
again
far
off
and
yet
familiar
pleased
me
about
this
way
of
invading
the
houses
of
men
i
thought
of
little
and
water
babies
but
i
decided
that
it
was
not
that
then
i
remembered
what
it
was
that
made
me
connect
such
trespass
with
ideas
quite
opposite
to
the
idea
of
crime
christmas
eve
of
course
and
santa
claus
coming
down
the
chimney
almost
at
the
same
instant
the
hairy
head
disappeared
into
the
black
hole
but
i
heard
a
voice
calling
to
me
from
below
a
second
or
two
afterwards
the
hairy
head
reappeared
it
was
dark
against
the
more
fiery
part
of
the
fog
and
nothing
could
be
spelt
of
its
expression
but
its
voice
called
on
me
to
follow
with
that
enthusiastic
impatience
proper
only
among
old
friends
i
jumped
into
the
gulf
and
as
blindly
as
curtius
for
i
was
still
thinking
of
santa
claus
and
the
traditional
virtue
of
such
vertical
entrance
in
every
gentleman
house
i
reflected
there
was
the
front
door
for
the
gentlemen
and
the
side
door
for
the
tradesmen
but
there
was
also
the
top
door
for
the
gods
the
chimney
is
so
to
speak
the
underground
passage
between
earth
and
heaven
by
this
starry
tunnel
santa
claus
manages
like
the
skylark
to
be
true
to
the
kindred
points
of
heaven
and
home
nay
owing
to
certain
conventions
and
a
widely
distributed
lack
of
courage
for
climbing
this
door
was
perhaps
little
used
but
santa
claus
door
was
really
the
front
door
it
was
the
door
fronting
the
universe
i
thought
this
as
i
groped
my
way
across
the
black
garret
or
loft
below
the
roof
and
scrambled
down
the
squat
ladder
that
let
us
down
into
a
yet
larger
loft
below
yet
it
was
not
till
i
was
down
the
ladder
that
i
suddenly
stood
still
and
thought
for
an
instant
of
retracing
all
my
steps
as
my
companion
had
retraced
them
from
the
beginning
of
the
garden
wall
the
name
of
santa
claus
had
suddenly
brought
me
back
to
my
senses
i
remembered
why
santa
clause
came
and
why
he
was
welcome
i
was
brought
up
in
the
propertied
classes
and
with
all
their
horror
of
offences
against
property
i
had
heard
all
the
regular
denunciations
of
robbery
both
right
and
wrong
i
had
read
the
ten
commandments
in
church
a
thousand
times
and
then
and
there
at
the
age
of
down
a
ladder
in
a
dark
room
in
the
bodily
act
of
burglar
i
saw
suddenly
for
the
first
time
that
theft
after
all
is
really
wrong
it
was
too
late
to
turn
back
however
and
i
followed
the
strangely
soft
footsteps
of
my
huge
companion
across
the
lower
and
larger
loft
till
he
knelt
down
on
a
part
of
the
bare
flooring
and
after
a
few
fumbling
efforts
lifted
a
sort
of
trapdoor
this
released
a
light
from
below
and
we
found
ourselves
looking
down
into
a
sitting
room
of
the
sort
that
in
large
houses
often
leads
out
of
a
bedroom
and
is
an
adjunct
to
it
light
thus
breaking
from
beneath
our
feet
like
a
soundless
explosion
showed
that
the
trapdoor
just
lifted
was
clogged
with
dust
and
rust
and
had
doubtless
been
long
disused
until
the
advent
of
my
enterprising
friend
but
i
did
not
look
at
this
long
for
the
sight
of
the
shining
room
underneath
us
had
an
almost
unnatural
attractiveness
to
enter
a
modern
interior
at
so
strange
an
angle
by
so
forgotten
a
door
was
an
epoch
in
one
psychology
it
was
like
having
found
a
fourth
dimension
my
companion
dropped
from
the
aperture
into
the
room
so
suddenly
and
soundlessly
that
i
could
do
nothing
but
follow
him
though
for
lack
of
practice
in
crime
i
was
by
no
means
soundless
before
the
echo
of
my
boots
had
died
away
the
big
burglar
had
gone
quickly
to
the
door
half
opened
it
and
stood
looking
down
the
staircase
and
listening
then
leaving
the
door
still
half
open
he
came
back
into
the
middle
of
the
room
and
ran
his
roving
blue
eye
round
its
furniture
and
ornament
the
room
was
comfortably
lined
with
books
in
that
rich
and
human
way
that
makes
the
walls
seem
alive
it
was
a
deep
and
full
but
slovenly
bookcase
of
the
sort
that
is
constantly
ransacked
for
the
purposes
of
reading
in
bed
one
of
those
stunted
german
stoves
that
look
like
red
goblins
stood
in
a
corner
and
a
sideboard
of
walnut
wood
with
closed
doors
in
its
lower
part
there
were
three
windows
high
but
narrow
after
another
glance
round
my
housebreaker
plucked
the
walnut
doors
open
and
rummaged
inside
he
found
nothing
there
apparently
except
an
extremely
handsome
decanter
containing
what
looked
like
port
somehow
the
sight
of
the
thief
returning
with
this
ridiculous
little
luxury
in
his
hand
woke
within
me
once
more
all
the
revelation
and
revulsion
i
had
felt
above
do
it
i
cried
quite
incoherently
claus
said
the
burglar
as
he
put
the
decanter
on
the
table
and
stood
looking
at
me
thought
about
that
too
ca
express
a
millionth
part
of
what
i
thought
of
i
cried
it
something
like
this
oh
ca
you
see
it
why
are
children
not
afraid
of
santa
claus
though
he
comes
like
a
thief
in
the
night
he
is
permitted
secrecy
trespass
almost
treachery
because
there
are
more
toys
where
he
has
been
what
should
we
feel
if
there
were
less
down
what
chimney
from
hell
would
come
the
goblin
that
should
take
away
the
children
balls
and
dolls
while
they
slept
could
a
greek
tragedy
be
more
gray
and
cruel
than
that
daybreak
and
awakening
can
you
think
of
anything
so
base
as
a
the
burglar
as
if
absently
took
a
large
revolver
from
his
pocket
and
laid
it
on
the
table
beside
the
decanter
but
still
kept
his
blue
reflective
eyes
fixed
on
my
face
i
said
stealing
is
that
why
it
really
wrong
the
goods
of
the
unhappy
children
of
men
should
be
really
respected
because
of
their
worthlessness
i
know
naboth
vineyard
is
as
painted
as
noah
ark
i
know
nathan
is
really
a
woolly
on
a
wooden
stand
that
is
why
i
could
not
take
them
away
i
did
not
mind
so
much
as
long
as
i
thought
of
men
things
as
their
valuables
but
i
dare
not
put
a
hand
upon
their
vanities
after
a
moment
i
added
abruptly
saints
and
sages
ought
to
be
robbed
they
may
be
stripped
and
pillaged
but
not
the
poor
little
worldly
people
of
the
things
that
are
their
poor
little
pride
he
set
out
two
wineglasses
from
the
cupboard
filled
them
both
and
lifted
one
of
them
with
a
salutation
towards
his
lips
do
it
i
cried
might
be
the
last
bottle
of
some
rotten
vintage
or
other
the
master
of
this
house
may
be
quite
proud
of
it
do
you
see
there
something
sacred
in
the
silliness
of
such
things
not
the
last
bottle
answered
my
criminal
calmly
plenty
more
in
the
cellar
know
the
house
then
i
said
well
he
answered
with
a
sadness
so
strange
as
to
have
something
eerie
about
it
am
always
trying
to
forget
what
i
know
and
to
find
what
i
do
know
he
drained
his
glass
he
added
will
do
him
good
will
do
him
good
wine
i
drinking
said
the
strange
person
he
drink
too
much
then
i
inquired
he
answered
unless
i
do
you
mean
i
demanded
the
owner
of
this
house
approves
of
all
you
do
forbid
he
answered
he
has
to
do
the
same
the
dead
face
of
the
fog
looking
in
at
all
three
windows
unreasonable
increased
a
sense
of
riddle
and
even
terror
about
this
tall
narrow
house
we
had
entered
out
of
the
sky
i
had
once
more
the
notion
about
the
gigantic
genii
i
fancied
that
enormous
egyptian
faces
of
the
dead
reds
and
yellows
of
egypt
were
staring
in
at
each
window
of
our
little
room
as
at
a
lighted
stage
of
marionettes
my
companion
went
on
playing
with
the
pistol
in
front
of
him
and
talking
with
the
same
rather
creepy
confidentialness
am
always
trying
to
find
him
to
catch
him
unawares
i
come
in
through
skylights
and
trapdoors
to
find
him
but
whenever
i
find
him
he
is
doing
what
i
am
doing
i
sprang
to
my
feet
with
a
thrill
of
fear
is
some
one
coming
i
cried
and
my
cry
had
something
of
a
shriek
in
it
not
from
the
stairs
below
but
along
the
passage
from
the
inner
bedchamber
which
seemed
somehow
to
make
it
more
alarming
footsteps
were
coming
nearer
i
am
quite
unable
to
say
what
mystery
or
monster
or
double
i
expected
to
see
when
the
door
was
pushed
open
from
within
i
am
only
quite
certain
that
i
did
not
expect
to
see
what
i
did
see
framed
in
the
open
doorway
stood
with
an
air
of
great
serenity
a
rather
tall
young
woman
definitely
though
indefinably
artistic
her
dress
the
colour
of
spring
and
her
hair
of
autumn
leaves
with
a
face
which
though
still
comparatively
young
conveyed
experience
as
well
as
intelligence
all
she
said
was
did
hear
you
come
in
came
in
another
way
said
the
permeator
somewhat
vaguely
left
my
latchkey
at
home
i
got
to
my
feet
in
a
mixture
of
politeness
and
mania
really
very
sorry
i
cried
know
my
position
is
irregular
would
you
be
so
obliging
as
to
tell
me
whose
house
this
is
said
the
burglar
i
present
you
to
my
wife
i
doubtfully
and
somewhat
slowly
resumed
my
seat
and
i
did
not
get
out
of
it
till
nearly
morning
smith
such
was
the
prosaic
name
of
this
far
from
prosaic
household
lingered
a
little
talking
slightly
and
pleasantly
she
left
on
my
mind
the
impression
of
a
certain
odd
mixture
of
shyness
and
sharpness
as
if
she
knew
the
world
well
but
was
still
a
little
harmlessly
afraid
of
it
perhaps
the
possession
of
so
jumpy
and
incalculable
a
husband
had
left
her
a
little
nervous
anyhow
when
she
had
retired
to
the
inner
chamber
once
more
that
extraordinary
man
poured
forth
his
apologia
and
autobiography
over
the
dwindling
wine
he
had
been
sent
to
cambridge
with
a
view
to
a
mathematical
and
scientific
rather
than
a
classical
or
literary
career
a
starless
nihilism
was
then
the
philosophy
of
the
schools
and
it
bred
in
him
a
war
between
the
members
and
the
spirit
but
one
in
which
the
members
were
right
while
his
brain
accepted
the
black
creed
his
very
body
rebelled
against
it
as
he
put
it
his
right
hand
taught
him
terrible
things
as
the
authorities
of
cambridge
university
put
it
unfortunately
it
had
taken
the
form
of
his
right
hand
flourishing
a
loaded
firearm
in
the
very
face
of
a
distinguished
don
and
driving
him
to
climb
out
of
the
window
and
cling
to
a
waterspout
he
had
done
it
solely
because
the
poor
don
had
professed
in
theory
a
preference
for
for
this
very
unacademic
type
of
argument
he
had
been
sent
down
vomiting
as
he
was
with
revulsion
from
the
pessimism
that
had
quailed
under
his
pistol
he
made
himself
a
kind
of
fanatic
of
the
joy
of
life
he
cut
across
all
the
associations
of
men
he
was
gay
but
by
no
means
careless
his
practical
jokes
were
more
in
earnest
than
verbal
ones
though
not
an
optimist
in
the
absurd
sense
of
maintaining
that
life
is
all
beer
and
skittles
he
did
really
seem
to
maintain
that
beer
and
skittles
are
the
most
serious
part
of
it
is
more
immortal
he
would
cry
love
and
war
type
of
all
desire
and
joy
beer
type
of
all
battle
and
conquest
skittles
there
was
something
in
him
of
what
the
old
world
called
the
solemnity
of
revels
when
they
spoke
of
a
mere
masquerade
or
wedding
banquet
nevertheless
he
was
not
a
mere
pagan
any
more
than
he
was
a
mere
practical
joker
his
eccentricities
sprang
from
a
static
fact
of
faith
in
itself
mystical
and
even
childlike
and
christian
do
deny
he
said
there
should
be
priests
to
remind
men
that
they
will
one
day
die
i
only
say
that
at
certain
strange
epochs
it
is
necessary
to
have
another
kind
of
priests
called
poets
actually
to
remind
men
that
they
are
not
dead
yet
the
intellectuals
among
whom
i
moved
were
not
even
alive
enough
to
fear
death
they
had
enough
blood
in
them
to
be
cowards
until
a
pistol
barrel
was
poked
under
their
very
noses
they
never
even
knew
they
had
been
born
for
ages
looking
up
an
eternal
perspective
it
might
be
true
that
life
is
a
learning
to
die
but
for
these
little
white
rats
it
was
just
as
true
that
death
was
their
only
chance
of
learning
to
live
his
creed
of
wonder
was
christian
by
this
absolute
test
that
he
felt
it
continually
slipping
from
himself
as
much
as
from
others
he
had
the
same
pistol
for
himself
as
brutus
said
of
the
dagger
he
continually
ran
preposterous
risks
of
high
precipice
or
headlong
speed
to
keep
alive
the
mere
conviction
that
he
was
alive
he
treasured
up
trivial
and
yet
insane
details
that
had
once
reminded
him
of
the
awful
subconscious
reality
when
the
don
had
hung
on
the
stone
gutter
the
sight
of
his
long
dangling
legs
vibrating
in
the
void
like
wings
somehow
awoke
the
naked
satire
of
the
old
definition
of
man
as
a
animal
without
feathers
the
wretched
professor
had
been
brought
into
peril
by
his
head
which
he
had
so
elaborately
cultivated
and
only
saved
by
his
legs
which
he
had
treated
with
coldness
and
neglect
smith
could
think
of
no
other
way
of
announcing
or
recording
this
except
to
send
a
telegram
to
an
old
friend
by
this
time
a
total
stranger
to
say
that
he
had
just
seen
a
man
with
two
legs
and
that
the
man
was
alive
the
uprush
of
his
released
optimism
burst
into
stars
like
a
rocket
when
he
suddenly
fell
in
love
he
happened
to
be
shooting
a
high
and
very
headlong
weir
in
a
canoe
by
way
of
proving
to
himself
that
he
was
alive
and
he
soon
found
himself
involved
in
some
doubt
about
the
continuance
of
the
fact
what
was
worse
he
found
he
had
equally
jeopardized
a
harmless
lady
alone
in
a
and
one
who
had
provoked
death
by
no
professions
of
philosophic
negation
he
apologized
in
wild
gasps
through
all
his
wild
wet
labours
to
bring
her
to
the
shore
and
when
he
had
done
so
at
last
he
seems
to
have
proposed
to
her
on
the
bank
anyhow
with
the
same
impetuosity
with
which
he
had
nearly
murdered
her
he
completely
married
her
and
she
was
the
lady
in
green
to
whom
i
had
recently
said
they
had
settled
down
in
these
high
narrow
houses
near
highbury
perhaps
indeed
that
is
hardly
the
word
one
could
strictly
say
that
smith
was
married
that
he
was
very
happily
married
that
he
not
only
did
not
care
for
any
woman
but
his
wife
but
did
not
seem
to
care
for
any
place
but
his
home
but
perhaps
one
could
hardly
say
that
he
had
settled
down
am
a
very
domestic
fellow
he
explained
with
gravity
have
often
come
in
through
a
broken
window
rather
than
be
late
for
tea
he
lashed
his
soul
with
laughter
to
prevent
it
falling
asleep
he
lost
his
wife
a
series
of
excellent
servants
by
knocking
at
the
door
as
a
total
stranger
and
asking
if
smith
lived
there
and
what
kind
of
a
man
he
was
the
london
general
servant
is
not
used
to
the
master
indulging
in
such
transcendental
ironies
and
it
was
found
impossible
to
explain
to
her
that
he
did
it
in
order
to
feel
the
same
interest
in
his
own
affairs
that
he
always
felt
in
other
people
know
there
a
fellow
called
smith
he
said
in
his
rather
weird
way
in
one
of
the
tall
houses
in
this
terrace
i
know
he
is
really
happy
and
yet
i
can
never
catch
him
at
it
sometimes
he
would
of
a
sudden
treat
his
wife
with
a
kind
of
paralyzed
politeness
like
a
young
stranger
struck
with
love
at
first
sight
sometimes
he
would
extend
this
poetic
fear
to
the
very
furniture
would
seem
to
apologize
to
the
chair
he
sat
on
and
climb
the
staircase
as
cautiously
as
a
cragsman
to
renew
in
himself
the
sense
of
their
skeleton
of
reality
every
stair
is
a
ladder
and
every
stool
a
leg
he
said
and
at
other
times
he
would
play
the
stranger
exactly
in
the
opposite
sense
and
would
enter
by
another
way
so
as
to
feel
like
a
thief
and
a
robber
he
would
break
and
violate
his
own
home
as
he
had
done
with
me
that
night
it
was
near
morning
before
i
could
tear
myself
from
this
queer
confidence
of
the
man
who
would
not
die
and
as
i
shook
hands
with
him
on
the
doorstep
the
last
load
of
fog
was
lifting
and
rifts
of
daylight
revealed
the
stairway
of
irregular
street
levels
that
looked
like
the
end
of
the
world
it
will
be
enough
for
many
to
say
that
i
had
passed
a
night
with
a
maniac
what
other
term
it
will
be
said
could
be
applied
to
such
a
being
a
man
who
reminds
himself
that
he
is
married
by
pretending
not
to
be
married
a
man
who
tries
to
covet
his
own
goods
instead
of
his
neighbor
on
this
i
have
but
one
word
to
say
and
i
feel
it
of
my
honour
to
say
it
though
no
one
understands
i
believe
the
maniac
was
one
of
those
who
do
not
merely
come
but
are
sent
sent
like
a
great
gale
upon
ships
by
him
who
made
his
angels
winds
and
his
messengers
a
flaming
fire
this
at
least
i
know
for
certain
whether
such
men
have
laughed
or
wept
we
have
laughed
at
their
laughter
as
much
as
at
their
weeping
whether
they
cursed
or
blessed
the
world
they
have
never
fitted
it
it
is
true
that
men
have
shrunk
from
the
sting
of
a
great
satirist
as
if
from
the
sting
of
an
adder
but
it
is
equally
true
that
men
flee
from
the
embrace
of
a
great
optimist
as
from
the
embrace
of
a
bear
nothing
brings
down
more
curses
than
a
real
benediction
for
the
goodness
of
good
things
like
the
badness
of
bad
things
is
a
prodigy
past
speech
it
is
to
be
pictured
rather
than
spoken
we
shall
have
gone
deeper
than
the
deeps
of
heaven
and
grown
older
than
the
oldest
angels
before
we
feel
even
in
its
first
faint
vibrations
the
everlasting
violence
of
that
double
passion
with
which
god
hates
and
loves
the
i
am
yours

the
instant
he

all

they

assent
something
had
bound
them
together

in

sacred

of

something
also
in
the

still
bowed
above

wrinkle
was
on

he
carefully

is
still
under
a
charge
of
attempted
burglary
or
else
that
is
exploded
but
he
is
pretty
well
fixed
for
attempted
bigamy
it
all
depends
on
what
view
we
take
of
the
alleged
letter
from
curate
percy
under
these
conditions
i
feel
justified
in
claiming
my
right
to
questions
may
i
ask
how
the
defence
got
hold
of
the
letter
from
curate
percy
did
it
come
direct
from
the
prisoner
we
have
had
nothing
direct
from
the
prisoner
said
moon
quietly
the
few
documents
which
the
defence
guarantees
came
to
us
from
another
quarter
from
what
quarter
asked
pym
if
you
insist
answered
moon
we
had
them
from
miss
gray
cyrus
pym
quite
forgot
to
close
his
eyes
and
instead
opened
them
very
wide
do
you
really
mean
to
say
he
said
that
miss
gray
was
in
possession
of
this
document
testifying
to
a
previous
mrs
smith
quite
so
said
inglewood
and
sat
down
the
doctor
said
something
about
infatuation
in
a
low
and
painful
voice
and
then
with
visible
difficulty
continued
his
opening
remarks
unfortunately
the
tragic
truth
revealed
by
curate
percy
narrative
is
only
too
crushingly
confirmed
by
other
and
shocking
documents
in
our
own
possession
of
these
the
principal
and
most
certain
is
the
testimony
of
innocent
smith
gardener
who
was
present
at
the
most
dramatic
and
of
his
many
acts
of
marital
infidelity
gould
the
gardener
please
gould
with
his
tireless
cheerfulness
arose
to
present
the
gardener
that
functionary
explained
that
he
had
served
and
innocent
smith
when
they
had
a
little
house
on
the
edge
of
croydon
from
the
gardener
tale
with
its
many
small
allusions
inglewood
grew
certain
he
had
seen
the
place
it
was
one
of
those
corners
of
town
or
country
that
one
does
not
forget
for
it
looked
like
a
frontier
the
garden
hung
very
high
above
the
lane
and
its
end
was
steep
and
sharp
like
a
fortress
beyond
was
a
roll
of
real
country
with
a
white
path
sprawling
across
it
and
the
roots
boles
and
branches
of
great
gray
trees
writhing
and
twisting
against
the
sky
but
as
if
to
assert
that
the
lane
itself
was
suburban
were
sharply
relieved
against
that
gray
and
tossing
upland
a
painted
a
peculiar
and
a
red
that
stood
exactly
at
the
corner
inglewood
was
sure
of
the
place
he
had
passed
it
twenty
times
in
his
constitutionals
on
the
bicycle
he
had
always
dimly
felt
it
was
a
place
where
something
might
occur
but
it
gave
him
quite
a
shiver
to
feel
that
the
face
of
his
frightful
friend
or
enemy
smith
might
at
any
time
have
appeared
over
the
garden
bushes
above
the
gardener
account
unlike
the
curate
was
quite
free
from
decorative
adjectives
however
many
he
may
have
uttered
privately
when
writing
it
he
simply
said
that
on
a
particular
morning
smith
came
out
and
began
to
play
about
with
a
rake
as
he
often
did
sometimes
he
would
tickle
the
nose
of
his
eldest
child
he
had
two
children
sometimes
he
would
hook
the
rake
on
to
the
branch
of
a
tree
and
hoist
himself
up
with
horrible
gymnastic
jerks
like
those
of
a
giant
frog
in
its
final
agony
never
apparently
did
he
think
of
putting
the
rake
to
any
of
its
proper
uses
and
the
gardener
in
consequence
treated
his
actions
with
coldness
and
brevity
but
the
gardener
was
certain
that
on
one
particular
morning
in
october
he
the
gardener
had
come
round
the
corner
of
the
house
carrying
the
hose
had
seen
smith
standing
on
the
lawn
in
a
striped
red
and
white
jacket
which
might
have
been
his
but
was
quite
as
like
a
part
of
his
pyjamas
and
had
heard
him
then
and
there
call
out
to
his
wife
who
was
looking
out
of
the
bedroom
window
on
to
the
garden
these
decisive
and
very
loud
expressions
i
wo
stay
here
any
longer
i
got
another
wife
and
much
better
children
a
long
way
from
here
my
other
wife
got
redder
hair
than
yours
and
my
other
garden
got
a
much
finer
situation
and
i
going
off
to
them
with
these
words
apparently
he
sent
the
rake
flying
far
up
into
the
sky
higher
than
many
could
have
shot
an
arrow
and
caught
it
again
then
he
cleared
the
hedge
at
a
leap
and
alighted
on
his
feet
down
in
the
lane
below
and
set
off
up
the
road
without
even
a
hat
much
of
the
picture
was
doubtless
supplied
by
inglewood
accidental
memory
of
the
place
he
could
see
with
his
mind
eye
that
big
figure
with
the
ragged
rake
swaggering
up
the
crooked
woodland
road
and
leaving
and
behind
but
the
gardener
on
his
own
account
was
quite
prepared
to
swear
to
the
public
confession
of
bigamy
to
the
temporary
disappearance
of
the
rake
in
the
sky
and
the
final
disappearance
of
the
man
up
the
road
moreover
being
a
local
man
he
could
swear
that
beyond
some
local
rumours
that
smith
had
embarked
on
the
coast
nothing
was
known
of
him
again
this
impression
was
somewhat
curiously
clinched
by
michael
moon
in
the
few
but
clear
phrases
in
which
he
opened
the
defence
upon
the
third
charge
so
far
from
denying
that
smith
had
fled
from
croydon
and
disappeared
on
the
continent
he
seemed
prepared
to
prove
all
this
on
his
own
account
i
hope
you
are
not
so
insular
he
said
that
you
will
not
respect
the
word
of
a
french
innkeeper
as
much
as
that
of
an
english
gardener
by
inglewood
favour
we
will
hear
the
french
innkeeper
before
the
company
had
decided
the
delicate
point
inglewood
was
already
reading
the
account
in
question
it
was
in
french
it
seemed
to
them
to
run
something
like
this
sir
yes
i
am
durobin
of
durobin
cafe
on
the
at
gras
rather
north
of
dunquerque
i
am
willing
to
write
all
i
know
of
the
stranger
out
of
the
sea
i
have
no
sympathy
with
eccentrics
or
poets
a
man
of
sense
looks
for
beauty
in
things
deliberately
intended
to
be
beautiful
such
as
a
trim
or
an
ivory
statuette
one
does
not
permit
beauty
to
pervade
one
whole
life
just
as
one
does
not
pave
all
the
roads
with
ivory
or
cover
all
the
fields
with
geraniums
my
faith
but
we
should
miss
the
onions
but
whether
i
read
things
backwards
through
my
memory
or
whether
there
are
indeed
atmospheres
of
psychology
which
the
eye
of
science
can
not
as
yet
pierce
it
is
the
humiliating
fact
that
on
that
particular
evening
i
felt
like
a
poet
like
any
little
rascal
of
a
poet
who
drinks
absinthe
in
the
mad
montmartre
positively
the
sea
itself
looked
like
absinthe
green
and
bitter
and
poisonous
i
had
never
known
it
look
so
unfamiliar
before
in
the
sky
was
that
early
and
stormy
darkness
that
is
so
depressing
to
the
mind
and
the
wind
blew
shrilly
round
the
little
lonely
coloured
kiosk
where
they
sell
the
newspapers
and
along
the
by
the
shore
there
i
saw
a
with
a
brown
sail
standing
in
silently
from
the
sea
it
was
already
quite
close
and
out
of
it
clambered
a
man
of
monstrous
stature
who
came
wading
to
shore
with
the
water
not
up
to
his
knees
though
it
would
have
reached
the
hips
of
many
men
he
leaned
on
a
long
rake
or
pole
which
looked
like
a
trident
and
made
him
look
like
a
triton
wet
as
he
was
and
with
strips
of
seaweed
clinging
to
him
he
walked
across
to
my
cafe
and
sitting
down
at
a
table
outside
asked
for
cherry
brandy
a
liqueur
which
i
keep
but
is
seldom
demanded
then
the
monster
with
great
politeness
invited
me
to
partake
of
a
vermouth
before
my
dinner
and
we
fell
into
conversation
he
had
apparently
crossed
from
kent
by
a
small
boat
got
at
a
private
bargain
because
of
some
odd
fancy
he
had
for
passing
promptly
in
an
easterly
direction
and
not
waiting
for
any
of
the
official
boats
he
was
he
somewhat
vaguely
explained
looking
for
a
house
when
i
naturally
asked
him
where
the
house
was
he
answered
that
he
did
not
know
it
was
on
an
island
it
was
somewhere
to
the
east
or
as
he
expressed
it
with
a
hazy
and
yet
impatient
gesture
there
i
asked
him
how
if
he
did
not
know
the
place
he
would
know
it
when
he
saw
it
here
he
suddenly
ceased
to
be
hazy
and
became
alarmingly
minute
he
gave
a
description
of
the
house
detailed
enough
for
an
auctioneer
i
have
forgotten
nearly
all
the
details
except
the
last
two
which
were
that
the
was
painted
green
and
that
there
was
a
red
at
the
corner
red
i
cried
in
astonishment
the
place
must
be
in
england
had
forgotten
he
said
nodding
heavily
is
the
island
name
du
i
cried
testily
just
come
from
england
my
boy
said
it
was
england
said
my
imbecile
conspiratorially
said
it
was
kent
but
kentish
men
are
such
liars
one
believe
anything
they
say
i
said
must
pardon
me
i
am
elderly
and
the
of
the
young
men
are
beyond
me
i
go
by
common
sense
or
at
the
largest
by
that
extension
of
applied
common
sense
called
science
cried
the
stranger
is
only
one
good
thing
science
ever
discovered
a
good
thing
good
tidings
of
great
joy
that
the
world
is
round
i
told
him
with
civility
that
his
words
conveyed
no
impression
to
my
intelligence
mean
he
said
going
right
round
the
world
is
the
shortest
way
to
where
you
are
already
it
not
even
shorter
i
asked
stop
where
you
are
no
no
he
cried
emphatically
way
is
long
and
very
weary
at
the
end
of
the
world
at
the
back
of
the
dawn
i
shall
find
the
wife
i
really
married
and
the
house
that
is
really
mine
and
that
house
will
have
a
greener
and
a
redder
do
you
he
asked
with
a
sudden
intensity
you
never
want
to
rush
out
of
your
house
in
order
to
find
it
i
think
not
i
replied
tells
a
man
from
the
first
to
adapt
his
desires
to
the
probable
supply
of
life
i
remain
here
content
to
fulfil
the
life
of
man
all
my
interests
are
here
and
most
of
my
friends
and
yet
he
cried
starting
to
his
almost
terrific
height
made
the
french
revolution
me
i
said
am
not
quite
so
elderly
a
relative
perhaps
mean
your
sort
did
exclaimed
this
personage
your
damned
smug
settled
sensible
sort
made
the
french
revolution
oh
i
know
some
say
it
was
no
good
and
you
just
back
where
you
were
before
why
blast
it
all
that
just
where
we
all
want
to
be
back
where
we
were
before
that
is
revolution
going
right
round
every
revolution
like
a
repentance
is
a
return
he
was
so
excited
that
i
waited
till
he
had
taken
his
seat
again
and
then
said
something
indifferent
and
soothing
but
he
struck
the
tiny
table
with
his
colossal
fist
and
went
on
am
going
to
have
a
revolution
not
a
french
revolution
but
an
english
revolution
god
has
given
to
each
tribe
its
own
type
of
mutiny
the
frenchmen
march
against
the
citadel
of
the
city
together
the
englishman
marches
to
the
outskirts
of
the
city
and
alone
but
i
am
going
to
turn
the
world
upside
down
too
i
going
to
turn
myself
upside
down
i
going
to
walk
upside
down
in
the
cursed
upsidedownland
of
the
antipodes
where
trees
and
men
hang
head
downward
in
the
sky
but
my
revolution
like
yours
like
the
earth
will
end
up
in
the
holy
happy
place
the
celestial
incredible
place
the
place
where
we
were
before
with
these
remarks
which
can
scarcely
be
reconciled
with
reason
he
leapt
from
the
seat
and
strode
away
into
the
twilight
swinging
his
pole
and
leaving
behind
him
an
excessive
payment
which
also
pointed
to
some
loss
of
mental
balance
this
is
all
i
know
of
the
episode
of
the
man
landed
from
the
and
i
hope
it
may
serve
the
interests
of
accept
sir
the
assurances
of
the
very
high
consideration
with
which
i
have
the
honour
to
be
your
obedient
servant

the
next
document
in
our
dossier
continued
inglewood
comes
from
the
town
of
crazok
in
the
central
plains
of
russia
and
runs
as
follows
sir
my
name
is
paul
nickolaiovitch
i
am
the
stationmaster
at
the
station
near
crazok
the
great
trains
go
by
across
the
plains
taking
people
to
china
but
very
few
people
get
down
at
the
platform
where
i
have
to
watch
this
makes
my
life
rather
lonely
and
i
am
thrown
back
much
upon
the
books
i
have
but
i
can
not
discuss
these
very
much
with
my
neighbours
for
enlightened
ideas
have
not
spread
in
this
part
of
russia
so
much
as
in
other
parts
many
of
the
peasants
round
here
have
never
heard
of
bernard
shaw
i
am
a
liberal
and
do
my
best
to
spread
liberal
ideas
but
since
the
failure
of
the
revolution
this
has
been
even
more
difficult
the
revolutionists
committed
many
acts
contrary
to
the
pure
principles
of
humanitarianism
with
which
indeed
owing
to
the
scarcity
of
books
they
were
ill
acquainted
i
did
not
approve
of
these
cruel
acts
though
provoked
by
the
tyranny
of
the
government
but
now
there
is
a
tendency
to
reproach
all
intelligents
with
the
memory
of
them
this
is
very
unfortunate
for
intelligents
it
was
when
the
railway
strike
was
almost
over
and
a
few
trains
came
through
at
long
intervals
that
i
stood
one
day
watching
a
train
that
had
come
in
only
one
person
got
out
of
the
train
far
away
up
at
the
other
end
of
it
for
it
was
a
very
long
train
it
was
evening
with
a
cold
greenish
sky
a
little
snow
had
fallen
but
not
enough
to
whiten
the
plain
which
stretched
away
a
sort
of
sad
purple
in
all
directions
save
where
the
flat
tops
of
some
distant
tablelands
caught
the
evening
light
like
lakes
as
the
solitary
man
came
stamping
along
on
the
thin
snow
by
the
train
he
grew
larger
and
larger
i
thought
i
had
never
seen
so
large
a
man
but
he
looked
even
taller
than
he
was
i
think
because
his
shoulders
were
very
big
and
his
head
comparatively
little
from
the
big
shoulders
hung
a
tattered
old
jacket
striped
dull
red
and
dirty
white
very
thin
for
the
winter
and
one
hand
rested
on
a
huge
pole
such
as
peasants
rake
in
weeds
with
to
burn
them
before
he
had
traversed
the
full
length
of
the
train
he
was
entangled
in
one
of
those
knots
of
rowdies
that
were
the
embers
of
the
extinct
revolution
though
they
mostly
disgraced
themselves
upon
the
government
side
i
was
just
moving
to
his
assistance
when
he
whirled
up
his
rake
and
laid
out
right
and
left
with
such
energy
that
he
came
through
them
without
scathe
and
strode
right
up
to
me
leaving
them
staggered
and
really
astonished
yet
when
he
reached
me
after
so
abrupt
an
assertion
of
his
aim
he
could
only
say
rather
dubiously
in
french
that
he
wanted
a
house
are
not
many
houses
to
be
had
round
here
i
answered
in
the
same
language
district
has
been
very
disturbed
a
revolution
as
you
know
has
recently
been
suppressed
any
further
building
i
do
mean
that
he
cried
mean
a
real
house
a
live
house
it
really
is
a
live
house
for
it
runs
away
from
me
am
ashamed
to
say
that
something
in
his
phrase
or
gesture
moved
me
profoundly
we
russians
are
brought
up
in
an
atmosphere
of
and
its
unfortunate
effects
can
still
be
seen
in
the
bright
colours
of
the
children
dolls
and
of
the
ikons
for
an
instant
the
idea
of
a
house
running
away
from
a
man
gave
me
pleasure
for
the
enlightenment
of
man
moves
slowly
you
no
other
house
of
your
own
i
asked
have
left
it
he
said
very
sadly
was
not
the
house
that
grew
dull
but
i
that
grew
dull
in
it
my
wife
was
better
than
all
women
and
yet
i
could
not
feel
it
so
i
said
with
sympathy
walked
straight
out
of
the
front
door
like
a
masculine
nora
he
inquired
politely
apparently
supposing
it
to
be
a
russian
word
mean
nora
in
the
doll
house
i
replied
at
this
he
looked
very
much
astonished
and
i
knew
he
was
an
englishman
for
englishmen
always
think
that
russians
study
nothing
but
the
doll
house
he
cried
vehemently
that
is
just
where
ibsen
was
so
wrong
why
the
whole
aim
of
a
house
is
to
be
a
doll
house
do
you
remember
when
you
were
a
child
how
those
little
windows
were
windows
while
the
big
windows
were
a
child
has
a
doll
house
and
shrieks
when
a
front
door
opens
inwards
a
banker
has
a
real
house
yet
how
numerous
are
the
bankers
who
fail
to
emit
the
faintest
shriek
when
their
real
front
doors
open
inwards
something
from
the
of
my
infancy
still
kept
me
foolishly
silent
and
before
i
could
speak
the
englishman
had
leaned
over
and
was
saying
in
a
sort
of
loud
whisper
have
found
out
how
to
make
a
big
thing
small
i
have
found
out
how
to
turn
a
house
into
a
doll
house
get
a
long
way
off
it
god
lets
us
turn
all
things
into
toys
by
his
great
gift
of
distance
once
let
me
see
my
old
brick
house
standing
up
quite
little
against
the
horizon
and
i
shall
want
to
go
back
to
it
again
i
shall
see
the
funny
little
toy
painted
green
against
the
gate
and
all
the
dear
little
people
like
dolls
looking
out
of
the
window
for
the
windows
really
open
in
my
doll
house
why
i
asked
you
wish
to
return
to
that
particular
doll
house
having
taken
like
nora
the
bold
step
against
convention
having
made
yourself
in
the
conventional
sense
disreputable
having
dared
to
be
free
why
should
you
not
take
advantage
of
your
freedom
as
the
greatest
modern
writers
have
pointed
out
what
you
called
your
marriage
was
only
your
mood
you
have
a
right
to
leave
it
all
behind
like
the
clippings
of
your
hair
or
the
parings
of
your
nails
having
once
escaped
you
have
the
world
before
you
though
the
words
may
seem
strange
to
you
you
are
free
in
russia
he
sat
with
his
dreamy
eyes
on
the
dark
circles
of
the
plains
where
the
only
moving
thing
was
the
long
and
labouring
trail
of
smoke
out
of
the
railway
engine
violet
in
tint
volcanic
in
outline
the
one
hot
and
heavy
cloud
of
that
cold
clear
evening
of
pale
green
he
said
with
a
huge
sigh
am
free
in
russia
you
are
right
i
could
really
walk
into
that
town
over
there
and
have
love
all
over
again
and
perhaps
marry
some
beautiful
woman
and
begin
again
and
nobody
could
ever
find
me
yes
you
have
certainly
convinced
me
of
something
his
tone
was
so
queer
and
mystical
that
i
felt
impelled
to
ask
him
what
he
meant
and
of
what
exactly
i
had
convinced
him
have
convinced
me
he
said
with
the
same
dreamy
eye
it
is
really
wicked
and
dangerous
for
a
man
to
run
away
from
his
wife
why
is
it
dangerous
i
inquired
because
nobody
can
find
him
answered
this
odd
person
we
all
want
to
be
found
most
original
modern
thinkers
i
remarked
gorki
nietzsche
shaw
would
all
rather
say
that
what
we
want
most
is
to
be
lost
to
find
ourselves
in
untrodden
paths
and
to
do
unprecedented
things
to
break
with
the
past
and
belong
to
the
future
he
rose
to
his
whole
height
somewhat
sleepily
and
looked
round
on
what
was
i
confess
a
somewhat
desolate
scene
the
dark
purple
plains
the
neglected
railroad
the
few
ragged
knots
of
malcontents
shall
not
find
the
house
here
he
said
is
still
eastward
further
and
further
eastward
then
he
turned
upon
me
with
something
like
fury
and
struck
the
foot
of
his
pole
upon
the
frozen
earth
if
i
do
go
back
to
my
country
he
cried
may
be
locked
up
in
a
madhouse
before
i
reach
my
own
house
i
have
been
a
bit
unconventional
in
my
time
why
nietzsche
stood
in
a
row
of
ramrods
in
the
silly
old
prussian
army
and
shaw
takes
temperance
beverages
in
the
suburbs
but
the
things
i
do
are
unprecedented
things
this
round
road
i
am
treading
is
an
untrodden
path
i
do
believe
in
breaking
out
i
am
a
revolutionist
but
do
you
see
that
all
these
real
leaps
and
destructions
and
escapes
are
only
attempts
to
get
back
to
eden
to
something
we
have
had
to
something
we
at
least
have
heard
of
do
you
see
one
only
breaks
the
fence
or
shoots
the
moon
in
order
to
get
home
i
answered
after
due
reflection
do
think
i
should
accept
that
he
said
with
a
sort
of
a
sigh
you
have
explained
a
second
thing
to
me
do
you
mean
i
asked
thing
your
revolution
has
failed
he
said
and
walking
across
quite
suddenly
to
the
train
he
got
into
it
just
as
it
was
steaming
away
at
last
and
as
i
saw
the
long
snaky
tail
of
it
disappear
along
the
darkening
flats
i
saw
no
more
of
him
but
though
his
views
were
adverse
to
the
best
advanced
thought
he
struck
me
as
an
interesting
person
i
should
like
to
find
out
if
he
has
produced
any
literary
yours
paul
nickolaiovitch
there
was
something
in
this
odd
set
of
glimpses
into
foreign
lives
which
kept
the
absurd
tribunal
quieter
than
it
had
hitherto
been
and
it
was
again
without
interruption
that
inglewood
opened
another
paper
upon
his
pile
the
court
will
be
indulgent
he
said
if
the
next
note
lacks
the
special
ceremonies
of
our
it
is
ceremonious
enough
in
its
own
way
the
celestial
principles
are
permanent
i
am
and
i
tend
the
temple
of
all
the
ancestors
of
my
family
in
the
forest
of
fu
the
man
that
broke
through
the
sky
and
came
to
me
said
that
it
must
be
very
dull
but
i
showed
him
the
wrongness
of
his
thought
i
am
indeed
in
one
place
for
my
uncle
took
me
to
this
temple
when
i
was
a
boy
and
in
this
i
shall
doubtless
die
but
if
a
man
remain
in
one
place
he
shall
see
that
the
place
changes
the
pagoda
of
my
temple
stands
up
silently
out
of
all
the
trees
like
a
yellow
pagoda
above
many
green
pagodas
but
the
skies
are
sometimes
blue
like
porcelain
and
sometimes
green
like
jade
and
sometimes
red
like
garnet
but
the
night
is
always
ebony
and
always
returns
said
the
emperor
ho
the
came
at
evening
very
suddenly
for
i
had
hardly
seen
any
stirring
in
the
tops
of
the
green
trees
over
which
i
look
as
over
a
sea
when
i
go
to
the
top
of
the
temple
at
morning
and
yet
when
he
came
it
was
as
if
an
elephant
had
strayed
from
the
armies
of
the
great
kings
of
india
for
palms
snapped
and
bamboos
broke
and
there
came
forth
in
the
sunshine
before
the
temple
one
taller
than
the
sons
of
men
strips
of
red
and
white
hung
about
him
like
ribbons
of
a
carnival
and
he
carried
a
pole
with
a
row
of
teeth
on
it
like
the
teeth
of
a
dragon
his
face
was
white
and
discomposed
after
the
fashion
of
the
foreigners
so
that
they
look
like
dead
men
filled
with
devils
and
he
spoke
our
speech
brokenly
he
said
to
me
is
only
a
temple
i
am
trying
to
find
a
house
and
then
he
told
me
with
indelicate
haste
that
the
lamp
outside
his
house
was
green
and
that
there
was
a
red
post
at
the
corner
of
it
have
not
seen
your
house
nor
any
houses
i
answered
dwell
in
this
temple
and
serve
the
gods
you
believe
in
the
gods
he
asked
with
hunger
in
his
eyes
like
the
hunger
of
dogs
and
this
seemed
to
me
a
strange
question
to
ask
for
what
should
a
man
do
except
what
men
have
done
lord
i
said
must
be
good
for
men
to
hold
up
their
hands
even
if
the
skies
are
empty
for
if
there
are
gods
they
will
be
pleased
and
if
there
are
none
then
there
are
none
to
be
displeased
sometimes
the
skies
are
gold
and
sometimes
porphyry
and
sometimes
ebony
but
the
trees
and
the
temple
stand
still
under
it
all
so
the
great
confucius
taught
us
that
if
we
do
always
the
same
things
with
our
hands
and
our
feet
as
do
the
wise
beasts
and
birds
with
our
heads
we
may
think
many
things
yes
my
lord
and
doubt
many
things
so
long
as
men
offer
rice
at
the
right
season
and
kindle
lanterns
at
the
right
hour
it
matters
little
whether
there
be
gods
or
no
for
these
things
are
not
to
appease
gods
but
to
appease
men
he
came
yet
closer
to
me
so
that
he
seemed
enormous
yet
his
look
was
very
gentle
your
temple
he
said
your
gods
will
be
freed
and
i
smiling
at
his
simplicity
answered
so
if
there
be
no
gods
i
shall
have
nothing
but
a
broken
temple
and
at
this
that
giant
from
whom
the
light
of
reason
was
withheld
threw
out
his
mighty
arms
and
asked
me
to
forgive
him
and
when
i
asked
him
for
what
he
should
be
forgiven
he
answered
being
right
idols
and
emperors
are
so
old
and
wise
and
satisfying
he
cried
is
a
shame
that
they
should
be
wrong
we
are
so
vulgar
and
violent
we
have
done
you
so
many
iniquities
it
is
a
shame
we
should
be
right
after
all
and
i
still
enduring
his
harmlessness
asked
him
why
he
thought
that
he
and
his
people
were
right
and
he
answered
are
right
because
we
are
bound
where
men
should
be
bound
and
free
where
men
should
be
free
we
are
right
because
we
doubt
and
destroy
laws
and
customs
but
we
do
not
doubt
our
own
right
to
destroy
them
for
you
live
by
customs
but
we
live
by
creeds
behold
me
in
my
country
i
am
called
smip
my
country
is
abandoned
my
name
is
defiled
because
i
pursue
around
the
world
what
really
belongs
to
me
you
are
steadfast
as
the
trees
because
you
do
not
believe
i
am
as
fickle
as
the
tempest
because
i
do
believe
i
do
believe
in
my
own
house
which
i
shall
find
again
and
at
the
last
remaineth
the
green
lantern
and
the
red
post
i
said
to
him
the
last
remaineth
only
wisdom
but
even
as
i
said
the
word
he
uttered
a
horrible
shout
and
rushing
forward
disappeared
among
the
trees
i
have
not
seen
this
man
again
nor
any
other
man
the
virtues
of
the
wise
are
of
fine
brass
the
next
letter
i
have
to
read
proceeded
arthur
inglewood
will
probably
make
clear
the
nature
of
our
client
curious
but
innocent
experiment
it
is
dated
from
a
mountain
village
in
california
and
runs
as
follows
sir
a
person
answering
to
the
rather
extraordinary
description
required
certainly
went
some
time
ago
over
the
high
pass
of
the
sierras
on
which
i
live
and
of
which
i
am
probably
the
sole
stationary
inhabitant
i
keep
a
rudimentary
tavern
rather
ruder
than
a
hut
on
the
very
top
of
this
specially
steep
and
threatening
pass
my
name
is
louis
hara
and
the
very
name
may
puzzle
you
about
my
nationality
well
it
puzzles
me
a
great
deal
when
one
has
been
for
fifteen
years
without
society
it
is
hard
to
have
patriotism
and
where
there
is
not
even
a
hamlet
it
is
difficult
to
invent
a
nation
my
father
was
an
irishman
of
the
fiercest
and
most
of
the
old
californian
kind
my
mother
was
a
spaniard
proud
of
descent
from
the
old
spanish
families
round
san
francisco
yet
accused
for
all
that
of
some
admixture
of
red
indian
blood
i
was
well
educated
and
fond
of
music
and
books
but
like
many
other
hybrids
i
was
too
good
or
too
bad
for
the
world
and
after
attempting
many
things
i
was
glad
enough
to
get
a
sufficient
though
a
lonely
living
in
this
little
cabaret
in
the
mountains
in
my
solitude
i
fell
into
many
of
the
ways
of
a
savage
like
an
eskimo
i
was
shapeless
in
winter
like
a
red
indian
i
wore
in
hot
summers
nothing
but
a
pair
of
leather
trousers
with
a
great
straw
hat
as
big
as
a
parasol
to
defend
me
from
the
sun
i
had
a
bowie
knife
at
my
belt
and
a
long
gun
under
my
arm
and
i
dare
say
i
produced
a
pretty
wild
impression
on
the
few
peaceable
travellers
that
could
climb
up
to
my
place
but
i
promise
you
i
never
looked
as
mad
as
that
man
did
compared
with
him
i
was
fifth
avenue
i
dare
say
that
living
under
the
very
top
of
the
sierras
has
an
odd
effect
on
the
mind
one
tends
to
think
of
those
lonely
rocks
not
as
peaks
coming
to
a
point
but
rather
as
pillars
holding
up
heaven
itself
straight
cliffs
sail
up
and
away
beyond
the
hope
of
the
eagles
cliffs
so
tall
that
they
seem
to
attract
the
stars
and
collect
them
as
collect
a
mere
glitter
of
phosphorous
these
terraces
and
towers
of
rock
do
not
like
smaller
crests
seem
to
be
the
end
of
the
world
rather
they
seem
to
be
its
awful
beginning
its
huge
foundations
we
could
almost
fancy
the
mountain
branching
out
above
us
like
a
tree
of
stone
and
carrying
all
those
cosmic
lights
like
a
candelabrum
for
just
as
the
peaks
failed
us
soaring
impossibly
far
so
the
stars
crowded
us
as
it
seemed
coming
impossibly
near
the
spheres
burst
about
us
more
like
thunderbolts
hurled
at
the
earth
than
planets
circling
placidly
about
it
all
this
may
have
driven
me
mad
i
am
not
sure
i
know
there
is
one
angle
of
the
road
down
the
pass
where
the
rock
leans
out
a
little
and
on
windy
nights
i
seem
to
hear
it
clashing
overhead
with
other
rocks
yes
city
against
city
and
citadel
against
citadel
far
up
into
the
night
it
was
on
such
an
evening
that
the
strange
man
struggled
up
the
pass
broadly
speaking
only
strange
men
did
struggle
up
the
pass
but
i
had
never
seen
one
like
this
one
before
he
carried
i
can
not
conceive
why
a
long
dilapidated
garden
rake
all
bearded
and
bedraggled
with
grasses
so
that
it
looked
like
the
ensign
of
some
old
barbarian
tribe
his
hair
which
was
as
long
and
rank
as
the
grass
hung
down
below
his
huge
shoulders
and
such
clothes
as
clung
about
him
were
rags
and
tongues
of
red
and
yellow
so
that
he
had
the
air
of
being
dressed
like
an
indian
in
feathers
or
autumn
leaves
the
rake
or
pitchfork
or
whatever
it
was
he
used
sometimes
as
an
alpenstock
sometimes
i
was
told
as
a
weapon
i
do
not
know
why
he
should
have
used
it
as
a
weapon
for
he
had
and
afterwards
showed
me
an
excellent
in
his
pocket
that
he
said
use
only
for
peaceful
purposes
i
have
no
notion
what
he
meant
he
sat
down
on
the
rough
bench
outside
my
inn
and
drank
some
wine
from
the
vineyards
below
sighing
with
ecstasy
over
it
like
one
who
had
travelled
long
among
alien
cruel
things
and
found
at
last
something
that
he
knew
then
he
sat
staring
rather
foolishly
at
the
rude
lantern
of
lead
and
coloured
glass
that
hangs
over
my
door
it
is
old
but
of
no
value
my
grandmother
gave
it
to
me
long
ago
she
was
devout
and
it
happens
that
the
glass
is
painted
with
a
crude
picture
of
bethlehem
and
the
wise
men
and
the
star
he
seemed
so
mesmerized
with
the
transparent
glow
of
our
lady
blue
gown
and
the
big
gold
star
behind
that
he
led
me
also
to
look
at
the
thing
which
i
had
not
done
for
fourteen
years
then
he
slowly
withdrew
his
eyes
from
this
and
looked
out
eastward
where
the
road
fell
away
below
us
the
sunset
sky
was
a
vault
of
rich
velvet
fading
away
into
mauve
and
silver
round
the
edges
of
the
dark
mountain
amphitheatre
and
between
us
and
the
ravine
below
rose
up
out
of
the
deeps
and
went
up
into
the
heights
the
straight
solitary
rock
we
call
green
finger
of
a
queer
volcanic
colour
and
wrinkled
all
over
with
what
looks
undecipherable
writing
it
hung
there
like
a
babylonian
pillar
or
needle
the
man
silently
stretched
out
his
rake
in
that
direction
and
before
he
spoke
i
knew
what
he
meant
beyond
the
great
green
rock
in
the
purple
sky
hung
a
single
star
star
in
the
east
he
said
in
a
strange
hoarse
voice
like
one
of
our
ancient
eagles
wise
men
followed
the
star
and
found
the
house
but
if
i
followed
the
star
should
i
find
the
house
depends
perhaps
i
said
smiling
whether
you
are
a
wise
man
i
refrained
from
adding
that
he
certainly
did
look
it
may
judge
for
yourself
he
answered
am
a
man
who
left
his
own
house
because
he
could
no
longer
bear
to
be
away
from
it
certainly
sounds
paradoxical
i
said
heard
my
wife
and
children
talking
and
saw
them
moving
about
the
room
he
continued
all
the
time
i
knew
they
were
walking
and
talking
in
another
house
thousands
of
miles
away
under
the
light
of
different
skies
and
beyond
the
series
of
the
seas
i
loved
them
with
a
devouring
love
because
they
seemed
not
only
distant
but
unattainable
never
did
human
creatures
seem
so
dear
and
so
desirable
but
i
seemed
like
a
cold
ghost
therefore
i
cast
off
their
dust
from
my
feet
for
a
testimony
nay
i
did
more
i
spurned
the
world
under
my
feet
so
that
it
swung
full
circle
like
a
treadmill
you
really
mean
i
cried
you
have
come
right
round
the
world
your
speech
is
english
yet
you
are
coming
from
the
west
pilgrimage
is
not
yet
accomplished
he
replied
sadly
have
become
a
pilgrim
to
cure
myself
of
being
an
exile
something
in
the
word
awoke
down
in
the
roots
of
my
ruinous
experience
memories
of
what
my
fathers
had
felt
about
the
world
and
of
something
from
whence
i
came
i
looked
again
at
the
little
pictured
lantern
at
which
i
had
not
looked
for
fourteen
years
grandmother
i
said
in
a
low
tone
have
said
that
we
were
all
in
exile
and
that
no
earthly
house
could
cure
the
holy
that
forbids
us
rest
he
was
silent
a
long
while
and
watched
a
single
eagle
drift
out
beyond
the
green
finger
into
the
darkening
void
then
he
said
think
your
grandmother
was
right
and
stood
up
leaning
on
his
grassy
pole
think
that
must
be
the
reason
he
said
secret
of
this
life
of
man
so
ecstatic
and
so
unappeased
but
i
think
there
is
more
to
be
said
i
think
god
has
given
us
the
love
of
special
places
of
a
hearth
and
of
a
native
land
for
a
good
reason
dare
say
i
said
reason
otherwise
he
said
pointing
his
pole
out
at
the
sky
and
the
abyss
might
worship
that
do
you
mean
i
demanded
he
said
in
his
harsh
voice
largest
of
the
idols
the
mightiest
of
the
rivals
of
god
mean
pantheism
and
infinity
and
all
that
i
suggested
mean
he
said
with
increasing
vehemence
if
there
be
a
house
for
me
in
heaven
it
will
either
have
a
green
and
a
hedge
or
something
quite
as
positive
and
personal
as
a
green
and
a
hedge
i
mean
that
god
bade
me
love
one
spot
and
serve
it
and
do
all
things
however
wild
in
praise
of
it
so
that
this
one
spot
might
be
a
witness
against
all
the
infinities
and
the
sophistries
that
paradise
is
somewhere
and
not
anywhere
is
something
and
not
anything
and
i
would
not
be
so
very
much
surprised
if
the
house
in
heaven
had
a
real
green
after
all
with
which
he
shouldered
his
pole
and
went
striding
down
the
perilous
paths
below
and
left
me
alone
with
the
eagles
but
since
he
went
a
fever
of
homelessness
will
often
shake
me
i
am
troubled
by
rainy
meadows
and
mud
cabins
that
i
have
never
seen
and
i
wonder
whether
america
will
yours
faithfully
louis
hara
after
a
short
silence
inglewood
said
and
finally
we
desire
to
put
in
as
evidence
the
following
document
this
is
to
say
that
i
am
ruth
davis
and
have
been
housemaid
to
mrs
smith
at
laurels
in
croydon
for
the
last
six
months
when
i
came
the
lady
was
alone
with
two
children
she
was
not
a
widow
but
her
husband
was
away
she
was
left
with
plenty
of
money
and
did
not
seem
disturbed
about
him
though
she
often
hoped
he
would
be
back
soon
she
said
he
was
rather
eccentric
and
a
little
change
did
him
good
one
evening
last
week
i
was
bringing
the
out
on
to
the
lawn
when
i
nearly
dropped
them
the
end
of
a
long
rake
was
suddenly
stuck
over
the
hedge
and
planted
like
a
and
over
the
hedge
just
like
a
monkey
on
a
stick
came
a
huge
horrible
man
all
hairy
and
ragged
like
robinson
crusoe
i
screamed
out
but
my
mistress
even
get
out
of
her
chair
but
smiled
and
said
he
wanted
shaving
then
he
sat
down
quite
calmly
at
the
garden
table
and
took
a
cup
of
tea
and
then
i
realized
that
this
must
be
smith
himself
he
has
stopped
here
ever
since
and
does
not
really
give
much
trouble
though
i
sometimes
fancy
he
is
a
little
weak
in
his
head
ruth
davis
i
forgot
to
say
that
he
looked
round
at
the
garden
and
said
very
loud
and
strong
what
a
lovely
place
you
got
just
as
if
he
never
seen
it
before
the
room
had
been
growing
dark
and
drowsy
the
afternoon
sun
sent
one
heavy
shaft
of
powdered
gold
across
it
which
fell
with
an
intangible
solemnity
upon
the
empty
seat
of
mary
gray
for
the
younger
women
had
left
the
court
before
the
more
recent
of
the
investigations
duke
was
still
asleep
and
innocent
smith
looking
like
a
large
hunchback
in
the
twilight
was
bending
closer
and
closer
to
his
paper
toys
but
the
five
men
really
engaged
in
the
controversy
and
concerned
not
to
convince
the
tribunal
but
to
convince
each
other
still
sat
round
the
table
like
the
committee
of
public
safety
suddenly
moses
gould
banged
one
big
scientific
book
on
top
of
another
cocked
his
little
legs
up
against
the
table
tipped
his
chair
backwards
so
far
as
to
be
in
direct
danger
of
falling
over
emitted
a
startling
and
prolonged
whistle
like
a
steam
engine
and
asserted
that
it
was
all
his
eye
when
asked
by
moon
what
was
all
his
eye
he
banged
down
behind
the
books
again
and
answered
with
considerable
excitement
throwing
his
papers
about
all
those
been
reading
out
he
said
oh
do
talk
to
me
i
ai
littery
and
that
but
i
know
when
i
hear
i
got
a
bit
stumped
in
some
of
the
philosophical
bits
and
felt
inclined
to
go
out
for
a
and
but
we
living
in
west
and
not
in
and
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
is
that
some
things
and
some
things
do
those
are
the
things
that
do
i
thought
said
moon
gravely
that
we
quite
clearly
explained
oh
yes
old
chap
you
quite
clearly
explained
assented
gould
with
extraordinary
volubility
you
explain
an
elephant
off
the
doorstep
you
would
i
ai
a
clever
chap
like
you
but
i
ai
a
born
natural
michael
moon
and
when
an
elephant
on
my
doorstep
i
do
listen
to
no
explanations
got
a
trunk
i
trunk
you
says
fond
of
travellin
and
a
change
does
me
good
the
blasted
thing
got
tusks
i
look
a
gift
in
the
mouth
you
says
thank
the
goodness
and
the
graice
that
on
your
birth
smiled
it
nearly
as
big
as
the
i
the
bloomin
perspective
you
says
the
sacred
magic
of
distance
the
elephant
like
the
day
of
judgement
i
your
own
conscience
to
you
moses
gould
you
says
in
a
grive
and
tender
voice
well
i
got
a
conscience
as
much
as
you
i
do
believe
most
of
the
things
they
tell
you
in
church
on
sundays
and
i
do
believe
these
things
any
more
because
you
goes
on
about
as
if
you
was
in
church
i
believe
an
elephant
a
great
big
ugly
dingerous
beast
and
i
believe
smith
another
do
you
mean
to
say
asked
inglewood
that
you
still
doubt
the
evidence
of
exculpation
we
have
brought
forward
yes
i
do
still
doubt
it
said
gould
warmly
it
all
a
bit
too
and
some
of
it
a
bit
too
far
off
can
we
test
all
those
tales
can
we
drop
in
and
buy
the
at
the
railway
station
at
kosky
wosky
or
whatever
it
was
can
we
go
and
do
a
gargle
at
the
on
top
of
the
sierra
mountains
but
anybody
can
go
and
see
at
worthing
moon
regarded
him
with
an
expression
of
real
or
assumed
surprise
any
one
continued
gould
can
call
on
mr
trip
it
is
a
comforting
thought
replied
michael
with
restraint
but
why
should
any
one
call
on
mr
trip
for
just
exactly
the
sime
reason
cried
the
excited
moses
hammering
on
the
table
with
both
hands
for
just
exactly
the
sime
reason
that
he
should
communicate
with
and
bootle
of
paternoster
row
and
with
miss
gridley
class
academy
at
and
with
old
lady
bullingdon
who
lives
at
penge
again
to
go
at
once
to
the
moral
roots
of
life
said
michael
why
is
it
among
the
duties
of
man
to
communicate
with
old
lady
bullingdon
who
lives
at
penge
it
ai
one
of
the
duties
of
man
said
gould
nor
one
of
his
pleasures
either
i
can
tell
you
she
takes
the
crumpet
does
lady
bullingdon
at
penge
but
it
one
of
the
duties
of
a
prosecutor
the
innocent
blameless
butterfly
career
of
your
friend
smith
and
it
the
sime
with
all
the
others
i
mentioned
but
why
do
you
bring
in
these
people
here
asked
inglewood
why
because
we
got
proof
enough
to
sink
a
steamboat
roared
moses
because
i
got
the
papers
in
my
very
because
your
precious
innocent
is
a
blackguard
and
smasher
and
these
are
the
he
smashed
i
do
set
up
for
a
man
but
i
would
all
those
poor
girls
on
my
conscience
for
something
and
i
think
a
chap
that
capable
of
deserting
and
perhaps
killing
all
is
about
capable
of
cracking
a
crib
or
an
old
schoolmaster
so
i
do
care
much
about
the
other
yarns
one
way
or
another
i
think
said
cyrus
pym
with
a
refined
cough
that
we
are
approaching
this
matter
rather
irregularly
this
is
really
the
fourth
charge
on
the
charge
sheet
and
perhaps
i
had
better
put
it
before
you
in
an
ordered
and
scientific
manner
nothing
but
a
faint
groan
from
michael
broke
the
silence
of
the
darkening
room
chapter
iv
the
wild
weddings
or
the
polygamy
charge
a
modern
man
said
cyrus
pym
must
if
he
be
thoughtful
approach
the
problem
of
marriage
with
some
caution
marriage
is
a
stage
doubtless
a
suitable
stage
in
the
long
advance
of
mankind
towards
a
goal
which
we
can
not
as
yet
conceive
which
we
are
not
perhaps
as
yet
fitted
even
to
desire
what
gentlemen
is
the
ethical
position
of
marriage
have
we
outlived
it
outlived
it
broke
out
moon
why
nobody
ever
survived
it
look
at
all
the
people
married
since
adam
and
eve
and
all
as
dead
as
mutton
this
is
no
doubt
an
in
its
character
said
pym
frigidly
i
can
not
tell
what
may
be
mr
matured
and
ethical
view
of
marriage
i
can
tell
said
michael
savagely
out
of
the
gloom
marriage
is
a
duel
to
the
death
which
no
man
of
honour
should
decline
michael
said
arthur
inglewood
in
a
low
voice
you
must
keep
quiet
mr
moon
said
pym
with
exquisite
good
temper
probably
regards
the
institution
in
a
more
antiquated
manner
probably
he
would
make
it
stringent
and
uniform
he
would
treat
divorce
in
some
great
soul
of
steel
the
divorce
of
a
julius
caesar
or
of
a
salt
ring
robinson
exactly
as
he
would
treat
some
tramp
or
labourer
who
scoots
from
his
wife
science
has
views
broader
and
more
humane
just
as
murder
for
the
scientist
is
a
thirst
for
absolute
destruction
just
as
theft
for
the
scientist
is
a
hunger
for
monotonous
acquisition
so
polygamy
for
the
scientist
is
an
extreme
development
of
the
instinct
for
variety
a
man
thus
afflicted
is
incapable
of
constancy
doubtless
there
is
a
physical
cause
for
this
flitting
from
flower
to
flower
as
there
is
doubtless
for
the
intermittent
groaning
which
appears
to
afflict
mr
moon
at
the
present
moment
our
own
winterbottom
has
even
dared
to
say
a
certain
rare
and
fine
physical
type
polygamy
is
but
the
realization
of
the
variety
of
females
as
comradeship
is
the
realization
of
the
variety
of
males
in
any
case
the
type
that
tends
to
variety
is
recognized
by
all
authoritative
inquirers
such
a
type
if
the
widower
of
a
negress
does
in
many
ascertained
cases
espouse
seconde
an
albino
such
a
type
when
freed
from
the
gigantic
embraces
of
a
female
patagonian
will
often
evolve
from
its
own
imaginative
instinct
the
consoling
figure
of
an
eskimo
to
such
a
type
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
prisoner
belongs
if
blind
doom
and
unbearable
temptation
constitute
any
slight
excuse
for
a
man
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
has
these
excuses
earlier
in
the
inquiry
the
defence
showed
real
chivalric
ideality
in
admitting
half
of
our
story
without
further
dispute
we
should
like
to
acknowledge
and
imitate
so
eminently
a
style
by
conceding
also
that
the
story
told
by
curate
percy
about
the
canoe
the
weir
and
the
young
wife
seems
to
be
substantially
true
apparently
smith
did
marry
a
young
woman
he
had
nearly
run
down
in
a
boat
it
only
remains
to
be
considered
whether
it
would
not
have
been
kinder
of
him
to
have
murdered
her
instead
of
marrying
her
in
confirmation
of
this
fact
i
can
now
to
the
defence
an
unquestionable
record
of
such
a
marriage
so
saying
he
handed
across
to
michael
a
cutting
from
the
maidenhead
gazette
which
distinctly
recorded
the
marriage
of
the
daughter
of
a
coach
a
tutor
well
known
in
the
place
to
innocent
smith
late
of
brakespeare
college
cambridge
when
pym
resumed
it
was
realized
that
his
face
had
grown
at
once
both
tragic
and
triumphant
i
pause
upon
this
fact
he
said
seriously
because
this
fact
alone
would
give
us
the
victory
were
we
aspiring
after
victory
and
not
after
truth
as
far
as
the
personal
and
domestic
problem
holds
us
that
problem
is
solved
warner
and
i
entered
this
house
at
an
instant
of
highly
emotional
england
warner
has
entered
many
houses
to
save
human
kind
from
sickness
this
time
he
entered
to
save
an
innocent
lady
from
a
walking
pestilence
smith
was
just
about
to
carry
away
a
young
girl
from
this
house
his
cab
and
bag
were
at
the
very
door
he
had
told
her
she
was
going
to
await
the
marriage
license
at
the
house
of
his
aunt
that
aunt
continued
cyrus
pym
his
face
darkening
grandly
that
visionary
aunt
had
been
the
dancing
who
had
led
many
a
maiden
to
her
doom
into
how
many
virginal
ears
has
he
whispered
that
holy
word
when
he
said
there
glowed
about
her
all
the
merriment
and
high
morality
of
the
home
kettles
began
to
hum

to
purr

very
wild

destruction
inglewood
looked
up
to
find
to
his
astonishment
as
many
another
denizen
of
the
eastern
hemisphere
has
found
that
the
american
was
not
only
perfectly
serious
but
was
really
eloquent
and
affecting
when
the
difference
of
the
hemispheres
was
adjusted
it
is
therefore
atrociously
evident
that
the
man
smith
has
at
least
represented
himself
to
one
innocent
female
of
this
house
as
an
eligible
bachelor
being
in
fact
a
married
man
i
agree
with
my
colleague
gould
that
no
other
crime
could
approximate
to
this
as
to
whether
what
our
ancestors
called
purity
has
any
ultimate
ethical
value
indeed
science
hesitates
with
a
high
proud
hesitation
but
what
hesitation
can
there
be
about
the
baseness
of
a
citizen
who
ventures
by
brutal
experiments
upon
living
females
to
anticipate
the
verdict
of
science
on
such
a
point
the
woman
mentioned
by
curate
percy
as
living
with
smith
in
highbury
may
or
may
not
be
the
same
as
the
lady
he
married
in
maidenhead
if
one
short
sweet
spell
of
constancy
and
heart
repose
interrupted
the
plunging
torrent
of
his
profligate
life
we
will
not
deprive
him
of
that
long
past
possibility
after
that
conjectural
date
alas
he
seems
to
have
plunged
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
shaking
quagmires
of
infidelity
and
shame
pym
closed
his
eyes
but
the
unfortunate
fact
that
there
was
no
more
light
left
this
familiar
signal
without
its
full
and
proper
moral
effect
after
a
pause
which
almost
partook
of
the
character
of
prayer
he
continued
the
first
instance
of
the
accused
repeated
and
irregular
nuptials
he
exclaimed
comes
from
lady
bullingdon
who
expresses
herself
with
the
high
haughtiness
which
must
be
excused
in
those
who
look
out
upon
all
mankind
from
the
turrets
of
a
norman
and
ancestral
keep
the
communication
she
has
sent
to
us
runs
as
follows
lady
bullingdon
recalls
the
painful
incident
to
which
reference
is
made
and
has
no
desire
to
deal
with
it
in
detail
the
girl
polly
green
was
a
perfectly
adequate
dressmaker
and
lived
in
the
village
for
about
two
years
her
unattached
condition
was
bad
for
her
as
well
as
for
the
general
morality
of
the
village
lady
bullingdon
therefore
allowed
it
to
be
understood
that
she
favoured
the
marriage
of
the
young
woman
the
villagers
naturally
wishing
to
oblige
lady
bullingdon
came
forward
in
several
cases
and
all
would
have
been
well
had
it
not
been
for
the
deplorable
eccentricity
or
depravity
of
the
girl
green
herself
lady
bullingdon
supposes
that
where
there
is
a
village
there
must
be
a
village
idiot
and
in
her
village
it
seems
there
was
one
of
these
wretched
creatures
lady
bullingdon
only
saw
him
once
and
she
is
quite
aware
that
it
is
really
difficult
to
distinguish
between
actual
idiots
and
the
ordinary
heavy
type
of
the
rural
lower
classes
she
noticed
however
the
startling
smallness
of
his
head
in
comparison
to
the
rest
of
his
body
and
indeed
the
fact
of
his
having
appeared
upon
election
day
wearing
the
rosette
of
both
the
two
opposing
parties
appears
to
lady
bullingdon
to
put
the
matter
quite
beyond
doubt
lady
bullingdon
was
astounded
to
learn
that
this
afflicted
being
had
put
himself
forward
as
one
of
the
suitors
of
the
girl
in
question
lady
bullingdon
nephew
interviewed
the
wretch
upon
the
point
telling
him
that
he
was
a
to
dream
of
such
a
thing
and
actually
received
along
with
an
imbecile
grin
the
answer
that
donkeys
generally
go
after
carrots
but
lady
bullingdon
was
yet
further
amazed
to
find
the
unhappy
girl
inclined
to
accept
this
monstrous
proposal
though
she
was
actually
asked
in
marriage
by
garth
the
undertaker
a
man
in
a
far
superior
position
to
her
own
lady
bullingdon
could
not
of
course
countenance
such
an
arrangement
for
a
moment
and
the
two
unhappy
persons
escaped
for
a
clandestine
marriage
lady
bullingdon
can
not
exactly
recall
the
man
name
but
thinks
it
was
smith
he
was
always
called
in
the
village
the
innocent
later
lady
bullingdon
believes
he
murdered
green
in
a
mental
outbreak
the
next
communication
proceeded
pym
is
more
conspicuous
for
brevity
but
i
am
of
the
opinion
that
it
will
adequately
convey
the
upshot
it
is
dated
from
the
offices
of
hanbury
and
bootle
publishers
and
is
as
follows
sir
yrs
rcd
and
conts
noted
rumour

refers
to
a
miss

or
similar
name

here
nine
years
ago
to
marry
an
case
was
undoubtedly
curious
and
attracted
police
attention
girl
worked
excellently
till
about
when
apparently
went
mad
record
was
written
at
the
time
part
of
which
i
trip
the
fuller
statement
runs
as
follows
on
october
a
letter
was
sent
from
this
office
to
bernard
and
juke
bookbinders
opened
by
juke
it
was
found
to
contain
the
following
our
trip
will
call
at
as
we
wish
to
know
whether
it
is
really
decided
xy
to
this
juke
a
person
of
a
playful
mind
returned
the
answer
i
am
in
a
position
to
give
it
as
my
most
decided
opinion
that
it
is
not
really
decided
that
xy
juke
on
receiving
this
extraordinary
reply
our
trip
asked
for
the
original
letter
sent
from
him
and
found
that
the
typewriter
had
indeed
substituted
these
demented
hieroglyphics
for
the
sentences
really
dictated
to
her
our
trip
interviewed
the
girl
fearing
that
she
was
in
an
unbalanced
state
and
was
not
much
reassured
when
she
merely
remarked
that
she
always
went
like
that
when
she
heard
the
barrel
organ
becoming
yet
more
hysterical
and
extravagant
she
made
a
series
of
most
improbable
statements
as
that
she
was
engaged
to
the
man
that
he
was
in
the
habit
of
serenading
her
on
that
instrument
that
she
was
in
the
habit
of
playing
back
to
him
upon
the
typewriter
in
the
style
of
king
richard
and
blondel
and
that
the
organ
musical
ear
was
so
exquisite
and
his
adoration
of
herself
so
ardent
that
he
could
detect
the
note
of
the
different
letters
on
the
machine
and
was
enraptured
by
them
as
by
a
melody
to
all
these
statements
of
course
our
trip
and
the
rest
of
us
only
paid
that
sort
of
assent
that
is
paid
to
persons
who
must
as
quickly
as
possible
be
put
in
the
charge
of
their
relations
but
on
our
conducting
the
lady
downstairs
her
story
received
the
most
startling
and
even
exasperating
confirmation
for
the
an
enormous
man
with
a
small
head
and
manifestly
a
had
pushed
his
barrel
organ
in
at
the
office
doors
like
a
and
was
boisterously
demanding
his
alleged
fiancee
when
i
myself
came
on
the
scene
he
was
flinging
his
great
arms
about
and
reciting
a
poem
to
her
but
we
were
used
to
lunatics
coming
and
reciting
poems
in
our
office
and
we
were
not
quite
prepared
for
what
followed
the
actual
verse
he
uttered
began
i
think
vivid
inviolate
head
ringed
but
he
never
got
any
further
trip
made
a
sharp
movement
towards
him
and
the
next
moment
the
giant
picked
up
the
poor
lady
typewriter
like
a
doll
sat
her
on
top
of
the
organ
ran
it
with
a
crash
out
of
the
office
doors
and
raced
away
down
the
street
like
a
flying
wheelbarrow
i
put
the
police
upon
the
matter
but
no
trace
of
the
amazing
pair
could
be
found
i
was
sorry
myself
for
the
lady
was
not
only
pleasant
but
unusually
cultivated
for
her
position
as
i
am
leaving
the
service
of
hanbury
and
bootle
i
put
these
things
in
a
record
and
leave
it
with
them
signed
aubrey
clarke
publishers
reader
and
the
last
document
said
pym
complacently
is
from
one
of
those
women
who
have
in
this
age
introduced
your
english
girlhood
to
hockey
the
higher
mathematics
and
every
form
of
ideality
dear
sir
she
writes
i
have
no
objection
to
telling
you
the
facts
about
the
absurd
incident
you
mention
though
i
would
ask
you
to
communicate
them
with
some
caution
for
such
things
however
entertaining
in
the
abstract
are
not
always
auxiliary
to
the
success
of
a
girls
school
the
truth
is
this
i
wanted
some
one
to
deliver
a
lecture
on
a
philological
or
historical
question
a
lecture
which
while
containing
solid
educational
matter
should
be
a
little
more
popular
and
entertaining
than
usual
as
it
was
the
last
lecture
of
the
term
i
remembered
that
a
smith
of
cambridge
had
written
somewhere
or
other
an
amusing
essay
about
his
own
somewhat
ubiquitous
name
an
essay
which
showed
considerable
knowledge
of
genealogy
and
topography
i
wrote
to
him
asking
if
he
would
come
and
give
us
a
bright
address
upon
english
surnames
and
he
did
it
was
very
bright
almost
too
bright
to
put
the
matter
otherwise
by
the
time
that
he
was
halfway
through
it
became
apparent
to
the
other
mistresses
and
myself
that
the
man
was
totally
and
entirely
off
his
head
he
began
rationally
enough
by
dealing
with
the
two
departments
of
place
names
and
trade
names
and
he
said
quite
rightly
i
dare
say
that
the
loss
of
all
significance
in
names
was
an
instance
of
the
deadening
of
civilization
but
then
he
went
on
calmly
to
maintain
that
every
man
who
had
a
place
name
ought
to
go
to
live
in
that
place
and
that
every
man
who
had
a
trade
name
ought
instantly
to
adopt
that
trade
that
people
named
after
colours
should
always
dress
in
those
colours
and
that
people
named
after
trees
or
plants
such
as
beech
or
rose
ought
to
surround
and
decorate
themselves
with
these
vegetables
in
a
slight
discussion
that
arose
afterwards
among
the
elder
girls
the
difficulties
of
the
proposal
were
clearly
and
even
eagerly
pointed
out
it
was
urged
for
instance
by
miss
younghusband
that
it
was
substantially
impossible
for
her
to
play
the
part
assigned
to
her
miss
mann
was
in
a
similar
dilemma
from
which
no
modern
views
on
the
sexes
could
apparently
extricate
her
and
some
young
ladies
whose
surnames
happened
to
be
low
coward
and
craven
were
quite
enthusiastic
against
the
idea
but
all
this
happened
afterwards
what
happened
at
the
crucial
moment
was
that
the
lecturer
produced
several
horseshoes
and
a
large
iron
hammer
from
his
bag
announced
his
immediate
intention
of
setting
up
a
smithy
in
the
neighbourhood
and
called
on
every
one
to
rise
in
the
same
cause
as
for
a
heroic
revolution
the
other
mistresses
and
i
attempted
to
stop
the
wretched
man
but
i
must
confess
that
by
an
accident
this
very
intercession
produced
the
worst
explosion
of
his
insanity
he
was
waving
the
hammer
and
wildly
demanding
the
names
of
everybody
and
it
so
happened
that
miss
brown
one
of
the
younger
teachers
was
wearing
a
brown
dress
a
dress
that
went
quietly
enough
with
the
warmer
colour
of
her
hair
as
well
she
knew
she
was
a
nice
girl
and
nice
girls
do
know
about
those
things
but
when
our
maniac
discovered
that
we
really
had
a
miss
brown
who
was
brown
his
blew
up
like
a
powder
magazine
and
there
in
the
presence
of
all
the
mistresses
and
girls
he
publicly
proposed
to
the
lady
in
the
dress
you
can
imagine
the
effect
of
such
a
scene
at
a
girls
school
at
least
if
you
fail
to
imagine
it
i
certainly
fail
to
describe
it
of
course
the
anarchy
died
down
in
a
week
or
two
and
i
can
think
of
it
now
as
a
joke
there
was
only
one
curious
detail
which
i
will
tell
you
as
you
say
your
inquiry
is
vital
but
i
should
desire
you
to
consider
it
a
little
more
confidential
than
the
rest
miss
brown
who
was
an
excellent
girl
in
every
way
did
quite
suddenly
and
surreptitiously
leave
us
only
a
day
or
two
afterwards
i
should
never
have
thought
that
her
head
would
be
the
one
to
be
really
turned
by
so
absurd
an
believe
me
yours
faithfully
ada
gridley
i
think
said
pym
with
a
really
convincing
simplicity
and
seriousness
that
these
letters
speak
for
themselves
mr
moon
rose
for
the
last
time
in
a
darkness
that
gave
no
hint
of
whether
his
native
gravity
was
mixed
with
his
native
irony
throughout
this
inquiry
he
said
but
especially
in
this
its
closing
phase
the
prosecution
has
perpetually
relied
upon
one
argument
i
mean
the
fact
that
no
one
knows
what
has
become
of
all
the
unhappy
women
apparently
seduced
by
smith
there
is
no
sort
of
proof
that
they
were
murdered
but
that
implication
is
perpetually
made
when
the
question
is
asked
as
to
how
they
died
now
i
am
not
interested
in
how
they
died
or
when
they
died
or
whether
they
died
but
i
am
interested
in
another
analogous
question
that
of
how
they
were
born
and
when
they
were
born
and
whether
they
were
born
do
not
misunderstand
me
i
do
not
dispute
the
existence
of
these
women
or
the
veracity
of
those
who
have
witnessed
to
them
i
merely
remark
on
the
notable
fact
that
only
one
of
these
victims
the
maidenhead
girl
is
described
as
having
any
home
or
parents
all
the
rest
are
boarders
or
birds
of
passage
a
guest
a
solitary
dressmaker
a
doing
typewriting
lady
bullingdon
looking
from
her
turrets
which
she
bought
from
the
whartons
with
the
old
money
when
she
jumped
at
marrying
an
unsuccessful
gentleman
from
ulster
lady
bullingdon
looking
out
from
those
turrets
did
really
see
an
object
which
she
describes
as
green
trip
of
hanbury
and
bootle
really
did
have
a
typewriter
betrothed
to
smith
miss
gridley
though
idealistic
is
absolutely
honest
she
did
house
feed
and
teach
a
young
woman
whom
smith
succeeded
in
decoying
away
we
admit
that
all
these
women
really
lived
but
we
still
ask
whether
they
were
ever
born
oh
crikey
said
moses
gould
stifled
with
amusement
there
could
hardly
interposed
pym
with
a
quiet
smile
be
a
better
instance
of
the
neglect
of
true
scientific
process
the
scientist
when
once
convinced
of
the
fact
of
vitality
and
consciousness
would
infer
from
these
the
previous
process
of
generation
if
these
gals
said
gould
impatiently
if
these
gals
were
all
alive
all
alive
o
i
chance
a
fiver
they
were
all
born
you
lose
your
fiver
said
michael
speaking
gravely
out
of
the
gloom
all
those
admirable
ladies
were
alive
they
were
more
alive
for
having
come
into
contact
with
smith
they
were
all
quite
definitely
alive
but
only
one
of
them
was
ever
born
are
you
asking
us
to
believe
began
pym
i
am
asking
you
a
second
question
said
moon
sternly
can
the
court
now
sitting
throw
any
light
on
a
truly
singular
circumstance
pym
in
his
interesting
lecture
on
what
are
called
i
believe
the
relations
of
the
sexes
said
that
smith
was
the
slave
of
a
lust
for
variety
which
would
lead
a
man
first
to
a
negress
and
then
to
an
albino
first
to
a
patagonian
giantess
and
then
to
a
tiny
eskimo
but
is
there
any
evidence
of
such
variety
here
is
there
any
trace
of
a
gigantic
patagonian
in
the
story
was
the
typewriter
an
eskimo
so
picturesque
a
circumstance
would
not
surely
have
escaped
remark
was
lady
bullingdon
dressmaker
a
negress
a
voice
in
my
bosom
answers
lady
bullingdon
i
am
sure
would
think
a
negress
so
conspicuous
as
to
be
almost
socialistic
and
would
feel
something
a
little
rakish
even
about
an
albino
but
was
there
in
smith
taste
any
such
variety
as
the
learned
doctor
describes
so
far
as
our
slight
materials
go
the
very
opposite
seems
to
be
the
case
we
have
only
one
actual
description
of
any
of
the
prisoner
wives
the
short
but
highly
poetic
account
by
the
aesthetic
curate
dress
was
the
colour
of
spring
and
her
hair
of
autumn
leaves
autumn
leaves
of
course
are
of
various
colours
some
of
which
would
be
rather
startling
in
hair
green
for
instance
but
i
think
such
an
expression
would
be
most
naturally
used
of
the
shades
from
to
red
especially
as
ladies
with
their
hair
do
frequently
wear
light
artistic
greens
now
when
we
come
to
the
next
wife
we
find
the
eccentric
lover
when
told
he
is
a
donkey
answering
that
donkeys
always
go
after
carrots
a
remark
which
lady
bullingdon
evidently
regarded
as
pointless
and
part
of
the
natural
of
a
village
idiot
but
which
has
an
obvious
meaning
if
we
suppose
that
polly
hair
was
red
passing
to
the
next
wife
the
one
he
took
from
the
girls
school
we
find
miss
gridley
noticing
that
the
schoolgirl
in
question
wore
dress
that
went
quietly
enough
with
the
warmer
colour
of
her
hair
in
other
words
the
colour
of
the
girl
hair
was
something
redder
than
lastly
the
romantic
declaimed
in
the
office
some
poetry
that
only
got
as
far
as
the
words
vivid
inviolate
head
ringed
but
i
think
that
a
wide
study
of
the
worst
modern
poets
will
enable
us
to
guess
that
with
a
glory
of
red
or
with
its
passionate
red
was
the
line
that
rhymed
to
in
this
case
once
more
therefore
there
is
good
reason
to
suppose
that
smith
fell
in
love
with
a
girl
with
some
sort
of
auburn
or
hair
rather
he
said
looking
down
at
the
table
rather
like
miss
gray
hair
cyrus
pym
was
leaning
forward
with
lowered
eyelids
ready
with
one
of
his
more
pedantic
interpellations
but
moses
gould
suddenly
struck
his
forefinger
on
his
nose
with
an
expression
of
extreme
astonishment
and
intelligence
in
his
brilliant
eyes
mr
moon
contention
at
present
interposed
pym
is
not
even
if
veracious
inconsistent
with
the
view
of
smith
which
we
have
nailed
to
the
mast
science
has
long
anticipated
such
a
complication
an
incurable
attraction
to
a
particular
type
of
physical
woman
is
one
of
the
commonest
of
criminal
and
when
not
considered
narrowly
but
in
the
light
of
induction
and
evolution
at
this
late
stage
said
michael
moon
very
quietly
i
may
perhaps
relieve
myself
of
a
simple
emotion
that
has
been
pressing
me
throughout
the
proceedings
by
saying
that
induction
and
evolution
may
go
and
boil
themselves
the
missing
link
and
all
that
is
well
enough
for
kids
but
i
talking
about
things
we
know
here
all
we
know
of
the
missing
link
is
that
he
is
missing
and
he
be
missed
either
i
know
all
about
his
human
head
and
his
horrid
tail
they
belong
to
a
very
old
game
called
i
win
tails
you
lose
if
you
do
find
a
fellow
bones
it
proves
he
lived
a
long
while
ago
if
you
do
find
his
bones
it
proves
how
long
ago
he
lived
that
is
the
game
you
been
playing
with
this
smith
affair
because
smith
head
is
small
for
his
shoulders
you
call
him
microcephalous
if
it
had
been
large
you
have
called
it
as
long
as
poor
old
smith
seraglio
seemed
pretty
various
variety
was
the
sign
of
madness
now
because
turning
out
to
be
a
bit
monochrome
now
monotony
is
the
sign
of
madness
i
suffer
from
all
the
disadvantages
of
being
a
person
and
i
jolly
well
going
to
get
some
of
the
advantages
too
and
with
all
politeness
i
propose
not
to
be
bullied
with
long
words
instead
of
short
reasons
or
consider
your
business
a
triumphant
progress
merely
because
you
always
finding
out
that
you
were
wrong
having
relieved
myself
of
these
feelings
i
have
merely
to
add
that
i
regard
pym
as
an
ornament
to
the
world
far
more
beautiful
than
the
parthenon
or
the
monument
on
bunker
hill
and
that
i
propose
to
resume
and
conclude
my
remarks
on
the
many
marriages
of
innocent
smith
besides
this
red
hair
there
is
another
unifying
thread
that
runs
through
these
scattered
incidents
there
is
something
very
peculiar
and
suggestive
about
the
names
of
these
women
trip
you
will
remember
said
he
thought
the
name
was
blake
but
could
not
remember
exactly
i
suggest
that
it
might
have
been
black
and
in
that
case
we
have
a
curious
series
miss
green
in
lady
bullingdon
village
miss
brown
at
the
hendon
school
miss
black
at
the
publishers
a
chord
of
colours
as
it
were
which
ends
up
with
miss
gray
at
beacon
house
west
hampstead
amid
a
dead
silence
moon
continued
his
exposition
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
queer
coincidence
about
colours
personally
i
can
not
doubt
for
a
moment
that
these
names
are
purely
arbitrary
names
assumed
as
part
of
some
general
scheme
or
joke
i
think
it
very
probable
that
they
were
taken
from
a
series
of
costumes
that
polly
green
only
meant
polly
or
mary
when
in
green
and
that
mary
gray
only
means
mary
or
polly
when
in
gray
this
would
explain
cyrus
pym
was
standing
up
rigid
and
almost
pallid
do
you
actually
mean
to
suggest
he
cried
yes
said
michael
i
do
mean
to
suggest
that
innocent
smith
has
had
many
wooings
and
many
weddings
for
all
i
know
but
he
has
had
only
one
wife
she
was
sitting
on
that
chair
an
hour
ago
and
is
now
talking
to
miss
duke
in
the
garden
yes
innocent
smith
has
behaved
here
as
he
has
on
hundreds
of
other
occasions
upon
a
plain
and
perfectly
blameless
principle
it
is
odd
and
extravagant
in
the
modern
world
but
not
more
than
any
other
principle
plainly
applied
in
the
modern
world
would
be
his
principle
can
be
quite
simply
stated
he
refuses
to
die
while
he
is
still
alive
he
seeks
to
remind
himself
by
every
electric
shock
to
the
intellect
that
he
is
still
a
man
alive
walking
on
two
legs
about
the
world
for
this
reason
he
fires
bullets
at
his
best
friends
for
this
reason
he
arranges
ladders
and
collapsible
chimneys
to
steal
his
own
property
for
this
reason
he
goes
plodding
around
a
whole
planet
to
get
back
to
his
own
home
and
for
this
reason
he
has
been
in
the
habit
of
taking
the
woman
whom
he
loved
with
a
permanent
loyalty
and
leaving
her
about
so
to
speak
at
schools
and
places
of
business
so
that
he
might
recover
her
again
and
again
with
a
raid
and
a
romantic
elopement
he
seriously
sought
by
a
perpetual
recapture
of
his
bride
to
keep
alive
the
sense
of
her
perpetual
value
and
the
perils
that
should
be
run
for
her
sake
so
far
his
motives
are
clear
enough
but
perhaps
his
convictions
are
not
quite
so
clear
i
think
innocent
smith
has
an
idea
at
the
bottom
of
all
this
i
am
by
no
means
sure
that
i
believe
it
myself
but
i
am
quite
sure
that
it
is
worth
a
man
uttering
and
defending
the
idea
that
smith
is
attacking
is
this
living
in
an
entangled
civilization
we
have
come
to
think
certain
things
wrong
which
are
not
wrong
at
all
we
have
come
to
think
outbreak
and
exuberance
banging
and
barging
rotting
and
wrecking
wrong
in
themselves
they
are
not
merely
pardonable
they
are
unimpeachable
there
is
nothing
wicked
about
firing
a
pistol
off
even
at
a
friend
so
long
as
you
do
not
mean
to
hit
him
and
know
you
wo
it
is
no
more
wrong
than
throwing
a
pebble
at
the
sea
less
for
you
do
occasionally
hit
the
sea
there
is
nothing
wrong
in
bashing
down
a
and
breaking
through
a
roof
so
long
as
you
are
not
injuring
the
life
or
property
of
other
men
it
is
no
more
wrong
to
choose
to
enter
a
house
from
the
top
than
to
choose
to
open
a
from
the
bottom
there
is
nothing
wicked
about
walking
round
the
world
and
coming
back
to
your
own
house
it
is
no
more
wicked
than
walking
round
the
garden
and
coming
back
to
your
own
house
and
there
is
nothing
wicked
about
picking
up
your
wife
here
there
and
everywhere
if
forsaking
all
others
you
keep
only
to
her
so
long
as
you
both
shall
live
it
is
as
innocent
as
playing
a
game
of
in
the
garden
you
associate
such
acts
with
blackguardism
by
a
mere
snobbish
association
as
you
think
there
is
something
vaguely
vile
about
going
or
being
seen
going
into
a
pawnbroker
or
a
you
think
there
is
something
squalid
and
commonplace
about
such
a
connection
you
are
mistaken
this
man
spiritual
power
has
been
precisely
this
that
he
has
distinguished
between
custom
and
creed
he
has
broken
the
conventions
but
he
has
kept
the
commandments
it
is
as
if
a
man
were
found
gambling
wildly
in
a
gambling
hell
and
you
found
that
he
only
played
for
trouser
buttons
it
is
as
if
you
found
a
man
making
a
clandestine
appointment
with
a
lady
at
a
covent
garden
ball
and
then
you
found
it
was
his
grandmother
everything
is
ugly
and
discreditable
except
the
facts
everything
is
wrong
about
him
except
that
he
has
done
no
wrong
it
will
then
be
asked
does
innocent
smith
continue
far
into
his
middle
age
a
farcical
existence
that
exposes
him
to
so
many
false
charges
to
this
i
merely
answer
that
he
does
it
because
he
really
is
happy
because
he
really
is
hilarious
because
he
really
is
a
man
and
alive
he
is
so
young
that
climbing
garden
trees
and
playing
silly
practical
jokes
are
still
to
him
what
they
once
were
to
us
all
and
if
you
ask
me
yet
again
why
he
alone
among
men
should
be
fed
with
such
inexhaustible
follies
i
have
a
very
simple
answer
to
that
though
it
is
one
that
will
not
be
approved
there
is
but
one
answer
and
i
am
sorry
if
you
do
like
it
if
innocent
is
happy
it
is
because
he
is
innocent
if
he
can
defy
the
conventions
it
is
just
because
he
can
keep
the
commandments
it
is
just
because
he
does
not
want
to
kill
but
to
excite
to
life
that
a
pistol
is
still
as
exciting
to
him
as
it
is
to
a
schoolboy
it
is
just
because
he
does
not
want
to
steal
because
he
does
not
covet
his
neighbour
goods
that
he
has
captured
the
trick
oh
how
we
all
long
for
it
the
trick
of
coveting
his
own
goods
it
is
just
because
he
does
not
want
to
commit
adultery
that
he
achieves
the
romance
of
sex
it
is
just
because
he
loves
one
wife
that
he
has
a
hundred
honeymoons
if
he
had
really
murdered
a
man
if
he
had
really
deserted
a
woman
he
would
not
be
able
to
feel
that
a
pistol
or
a
was
like
a
song
at
least
not
a
comic
song
do
not
imagine
please
that
any
such
attitude
is
easy
to
me
or
appeals
in
any
particular
way
to
my
sympathies
i
am
an
irishman
and
a
certain
sorrow
is
in
my
bones
bred
either
of
the
persecutions
of
my
creed
or
of
my
creed
itself
speaking
singly
i
feel
as
if
man
was
tied
to
tragedy
and
there
was
no
way
out
of
the
trap
of
old
age
and
doubt
but
if
there
is
a
way
out
then
by
christ
and
patrick
this
is
the
way
out
if
one
could
keep
as
happy
as
a
child
or
a
dog
it
would
be
by
being
as
innocent
as
a
child
or
as
sinless
as
a
dog
barely
and
brutally
to
be
good
that
may
be
the
road
and
he
may
have
found
it
well
well
well
i
see
a
look
of
skepticism
on
the
face
of
my
old
friend
moses
gould
does
not
believe
that
being
perfectly
good
in
all
respects
would
make
a
man
merry
no
said
gould
with
an
unusual
and
convincing
gravity
i
do
not
believe
that
being
perfectly
good
in
all
respects
would
make
a
man
merry
well
said
michael
quietly
will
you
tell
me
one
thing
which
of
us
has
ever
tried
it
a
silence
ensued
rather
like
the
silence
of
some
long
geological
epoch
which
awaits
the
emergence
of
some
unexpected
type
for
there
rose
at
last
in
the
stillness
a
massive
figure
that
the
other
men
had
almost
completely
forgotten
well
gentlemen
said
warner
cheerfully
i
been
pretty
well
entertained
with
all
this
pointless
and
incompetent
tomfoolery
for
a
couple
of
days
but
it
seems
to
be
wearing
rather
thin
and
i
engaged
for
a
city
dinner
among
the
hundred
flowers
of
futility
on
both
sides
i
was
unable
to
detect
any
sort
of
reason
why
a
lunatic
should
be
allowed
to
shoot
me
in
the
back
garden
he
had
settled
his
silk
hat
on
his
head
and
gone
out
sailing
placidly
to
the
garden
gate
while
the
almost
wailing
voice
of
pym
still
followed
him
but
really
the
bullet
missed
you
by
several
feet
and
another
voice
added
the
bullet
missed
him
by
several
years
there
was
a
long
and
mainly
unmeaning
silence
and
then
moon
said
suddenly
we
have
been
sitting
with
a
ghost

chapter
v
how
the
great
wind
went
from
beacon
house
mary
was
walking
between
diana
and
rosamund
slowly
up
and
down
the
garden
they
were
silent
and
the
sun
had
set
such
spaces
of
daylight
as
remained
open
in
the
west
were
of
a
white
which
can
be
compared
to
nothing
but
a
cream
cheese
and
the
lines
of
plumy
cloud
that
ran
across
them
had
a
soft
but
vivid
violet
bloom
like
a
violet
smoke
all
the
rest
of
the
scene
swept
and
faded
away
into
a
gray
and
seemed
to
melt
and
mount
into
mary
figure
until
she
seemed
clothed
with
the
garden
and
the
skies
there
was
something
in
these
last
quiet
colours
that
gave
her
a
setting
and
a
supremacy
and
the
twilight
which
concealed
diana
statelier
figure
and
rosamund
braver
array
exhibited
and
emphasized
her
leaving
her
the
lady
of
the
garden
and
alone
when
they
spoke
at
last
it
was
evident
that
a
conversation
long
fallen
silent
was
being
revived
but
where
is
your
husband
taking
you
asked
diana
in
her
practical
voice
to
an
aunt
said
mary
that
just
the
joke
there
really
is
an
aunt
and
we
left
the
children
with
her
when
i
arranged
to
be
turned
out
of
the
other
down
the
road
we
never
take
more
than
a
week
of
this
kind
of
holiday
but
sometimes
we
take
two
of
them
together
does
the
aunt
mind
much
asked
rosamund
innocently
of
course
i
dare
say
it
very
and
what
that
other
word
you
know
what
goliath
was
but
i
known
many
aunts
who
would
think
it
well
silly
silly
cried
mary
with
great
heartiness
oh
my
sunday
hat
i
should
think
it
was
silly
but
what
do
you
expect
he
really
is
a
good
man
and
it
might
have
been
snakes
or
something
snakes
inquired
rosamund
with
a
slightly
puzzled
interest
uncle
harry
kept
snakes
and
said
they
loved
him
replied
mary
with
perfect
simplicity
auntie
let
him
have
them
in
his
pockets
but
not
in
the
bedroom
and
you
began
diana
knitting
her
dark
brows
a
little
oh
i
do
as
auntie
did
said
mary
as
long
as
we
not
away
from
the
children
more
than
a
fortnight
together
i
play
the
game
he
calls
me
and
you
must
write
it
all
one
word
or
he
quite
flustered
but
if
men
want
things
like
that
began
diana
oh
what
the
good
of
talking
about
men
cried
mary
impatiently
why
one
might
as
well
be
a
lady
novelist
or
some
horrid
thing
there
are
any
men
there
are
no
such
people
there
a
man
and
whoever
he
is
he
quite
different
so
there
is
no
safety
said
diana
in
a
low
voice
oh
i
do
know
answered
mary
lightly
enough
there
only
two
things
generally
true
of
them
at
certain
curious
times
they
just
fit
to
take
care
of
us
and
they
never
fit
to
take
care
of
themselves
there
is
a
gale
getting
up
said
rosamund
suddenly
look
at
those
trees
over
there
a
long
way
off
and
the
clouds
going
quicker
i
know
what
you
thinking
about
said
mary
and
you
be
silly
fools
do
you
listen
to
the
lady
novelists
you
go
down
the
king
highway
for
god
truth
it
is
god
yes
my
dear
michael
will
often
be
extremely
untidy

will
be
worse
he
be
untidy
but
what
else
are
all
the
trees
and
clouds
for
you
silly
kittens
the
clouds
and
trees
are
all
waving
about
said
rosamund
there
is
a
storm
coming
and
it
makes
me
feel
quite
excited
somehow
michael
is
really
rather
like
a
storm
he
frightens
me
and
makes
me
happy
do
you
be
frightened
said
mary
all
over
these
men
have
one
advantage
they
are
the
sort
that
go
out
a
sudden
thrust
of
wind
through
the
trees
drifted
the
dying
leaves
along
the
path
and
they
could
hear
the
trees
roaring
faintly
i
mean
said
mary
they
are
the
kind
that
look
outwards
and
get
interested
in
the
world
it
does
matter
a
bit
whether
it
arguing
or
bicycling
or
breaking
down
the
ends
of
the
earth
as
poor
old
innocent
does
stick
to
the
man
who
looks
out
of
the
window
and
tries
to
understand
the
world
keep
clear
of
the
man
who
looks
in
at
the
window
and
tries
to
understand
you
when
poor
old
adam
had
gone
out
gardening
arthur
will
go
out
gardening
the
other
sort
came
along
and
wormed
himself
in
nasty
old
snake
you
agree
with
your
aunt
said
rosamund
smiling
no
snakes
in
the
bedroom
i
did
agree
with
my
aunt
very
much
replied
mary
simply
but
i
think
she
was
right
to
let
uncle
harry
collect
dragons
and
griffins
so
long
as
it
got
him
out
of
the
house
almost
at
the
same
moment
lights
sprang
up
inside
the
darkened
house
turning
the
two
glass
doors
into
the
garden
into
gates
of
beaten
gold
the
golden
gates
were
burst
open
and
the
enormous
smith
who
had
sat
like
a
clumsy
statue
for
so
many
hours
came
flying
and
turning
down
the
lawn
and
shouting
acquitted
acquitted
echoing
the
cry
michael
scampered
across
the
lawn
to
rosamund
and
wildly
swung
her
into
a
few
steps
of
what
was
supposed
to
be
a
waltz
but
the
company
knew
innocent
and
michael
by
this
time
and
their
extravagances
were
gaily
taken
for
granted
it
was
far
more
extraordinary
that
arthur
inglewood
walked
straight
up
to
diana
and
kissed
her
as
if
it
had
been
his
sister
birthday
even
pym
though
he
refrained
from
dancing
looked
on
with
real
benevolence
for
indeed
the
whole
of
the
absurd
revelation
had
disturbed
him
less
than
the
others
he
half
supposed
that
such
irresponsible
tribunals
and
insane
discussions
were
part
of
the
mediaeval
mummeries
of
the
old
land
while
the
tempest
tore
the
sky
as
with
trumpets
window
after
window
was
lighted
up
in
the
house
within
and
before
the
company
broken
with
laughter
and
the
buffeting
of
the
wind
had
groped
their
way
to
the
house
again
they
saw
that
the
great
apish
figure
of
innocent
smith
had
clambered
out
of
his
own
attic
window
and
roaring
again
and
again
beacon
house
whirled
round
his
head
a
huge
log
or
trunk
from
the
wood
fire
below
of
which
the
river
of
crimson
flame
and
purple
smoke
drove
out
on
the
deafening
air
he
was
evident
enough
to
have
been
seen
from
three
counties
but
when
the
wind
died
down
and
the
party
at
the
top
of
their
evening
merriment
looked
again
for
mary
and
for
him
they
were
not
to
be
found
the
end
