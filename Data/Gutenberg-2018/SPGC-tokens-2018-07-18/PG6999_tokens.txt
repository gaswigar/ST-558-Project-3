proofreading
team
how
to
live
a
holy
life
orr
devotional
reading
a
person
may
almost
be
known
by
the
books
he
reads
if
he
habitually
reads
bad
books
we
can
pretty
safely
conclude
that
he
is
a
bad
man
on
the
other
hand
if
he
habitually
reads
religious
books
we
can
reasonably
presume
that
he
is
a
religious
man
why
is
this
it
is
because
the
nature
of
a
person
books
is
usually
the
nature
of
his
thoughts
and
as
a
man
thinks
so
he
is
consequently
our
reading
devotional
literature
is
a
great
aid
to
our
being
devotional
too
few
i
fear
realize
how
important
to
our
spiritual
advancement
is
the
cultivation
of
a
taste
for
devotional
reading
as
a
rule
those
who
have
a
taste
for
spiritual
books
and
gratify
that
taste
prosper
in
the
lord
while
those
who
have
no
relish
for
such
books
labor
at
a
great
disadvantage
some
one
has
said
that
he
who
begins
a
devout
life
without
a
taste
for
spiritual
reading
may
consider
the
ordinary
difficulties
multiplied
in
his
case
by
ten
the
most
spiritual
men
of
all
ages
have
had
a
strong
love
for
reading
spiritual
books
if
however
my
reader
happens
not
to
have
such
a
taste
or
such
a
love
he
should
not
be
discouraged
for
it
can
be
created
and
increased
through
perseverance
in
reading
devotional
literature
just
as
a
person
who
does
not
relish
a
certain
food
may
learn
to
like
it
if
he
will
persist
in
eating
it
so
a
person
who
does
not
have
a
taste
for
devotional
books
may
come
to
enjoy
them
if
he
will
diligently
and
prayerfully
peruse
them
spiritual
reading
invigorates
the
intellect
warms
the
affections
and
begets
in
us
a
desire
for
more
of
god
fulness
and
for
a
more
heavenly
life
it
is
especially
helpful
to
prayer
when
the
mind
is
dull
and
the
spirits
low
and
we
have
no
inspiration
for
prayer
the
reading
of
a
spiritual
poem
will
often
so
stimulate
the
mind
raise
the
spirits
and
animate
the
soul
as
to
make
it
easy
for
us
to
pray
as
to
what
books
to
read
the
bible
of
course
is
the
best
of
all
but
we
need
others
although
no
other
book
can
take
the
place
of
the
bible
and
none
of
us
should
neglect
reading
it
there
are
many
books
that
can
profitably
be
read
in
connection
with
it
but
whatever
devotional
book
you
are
reading
do
not
read
too
fast
think
and
digest
as
you
go
let
there
be
a
frequent
lifting
of
the
heart
to
god
in
prayer
it
is
not
the
bee
that
flies
so
swiftly
from
flower
to
flower
that
gathers
the
honey
but
the
bee
that
goes
down
into
the
flower
a
few
sentences
taken
into
the
mind
and
heart
and
dwelt
upon
until
they
have
become
a
part
of
us
are
better
than
many
pages
read
superficially
preface
if
the
reading
of
this
little
book
encourages
any
on
their
pilgrim
way
if
it
arouses
them
to
greater
diligence
if
it
creates
in
them
a
stronger
desire
to
live
more
like
christ
if
it
gives
them
a
better
understanding
of
how
to
live
this
poor
servant
of
the
lord
will
be
fully
rewarded
for
all
his
labor
even
among
the
children
of
god
in
this
beautiful
gospel
light
of
the
evening
there
is
an
inclination
on
the
part
of
a
few
at
least
and
maybe
more
than
a
few
to
slow
down
and
not
be
their
very
best
and
most
active
for
god
we
hope
that
this
little
book
will
arouse
such
ones
to
greater
zeal
and
earnestness
diligence
yea
constant
application
is
the
secret
of
success
in
all
manner
of
life
and
especially
in
the
christian
life
this
volume
is
written
for
all
those
who
desire
to
please
god
with
a
well
life
it
is
sent
forth
in
jesus
name
with
a
prayer
that
god
bless
and
help
both
the
reader
and
the
writer
to
live
life
at
its
very
best
and
fulfil
the
purpose
of
god
concerning
them
your
humble
servant
in
christian
love
the
author
introduction
we
have
only
one
life
to
live
only
one
think
of
this
for
a
moment
here
we
are
in
this
world
of
time
making
the
journey
of
life
each
day
we
are
farther
from
the
cradle
and
nearer
the
grave
solemn
thought
see
the
mighty
concourse
of
human
lives
hear
their
heavy
tread
in
their
onward
march
some
are
just
beginning
life
journey
some
are
midway
up
the
hill
some
have
reached
the
top
and
some
are
midway
down
the
western
slope
but
where
are
we
all
going
listen
and
you
will
hear
but
one
answer
eternity
beyond
the
fading
dying
gleams
of
the
sunset
of
life
lies
a
boundless
endless
ocean
called
eternity
thitherward
you
and
i
are
daily
traveling
time
is
like
a
great
wheel
going
its
round
on
and
on
it
goes
some
are
stepping
on
and
some
are
stepping
off
but
where
are
these
latter
stepping
into
eternity
see
that
old
man
with
bent
form
locks
and
tottering
steps
his
has
been
a
long
round
but
he
has
made
it
at
last
see
the
his
round
has
not
been
so
long
but
he
must
step
off
see
the
youth
he
has
been
on
only
a
little
while
but
he
is
brought
to
the
place
he
thought
his
round
would
be
much
longer
he
supposed
he
was
fairly
getting
started
when
that
icy
hand
was
laid
upon
him
and
the
usher
said
come
you
have
made
your
round
and
you
must
go
the
infant
that
gave
its
first
faint
cry
this
morning
may
utter
its
last
feeble
wail
tonight
and
thus
they
go
but
where
eternity
if
you
were
to
start
today
and
ask
each
person
you
met
the
question
where
are
you
going
and
if
possible
you
were
to
travel
the
world
over
and
ask
each
one
of
earth
inhabitants
there
could
be
but
one
answer
eternity
oh
eternity
long
eternity
hear
the
solemn
footsteps
of
eternity
only
one
life
to
live
only
one
life
and
then
we
must
face
vast
endless
eternity
we
shall
pass
along
the
pathway
of
life
but
once
every
step
we
take
is
a
step
that
can
never
be
taken
again
with
this
fact
in
mind
who
does
not
feel
like
calling
upon
the
to
direct
his
every
step
if
when
we
make
a
misstep
we
could
go
back
and
step
it
over
then
there
would
not
be
such
great
necessity
to
step
carefully
but
we
can
never
go
back
we
are
leaving
footprints
just
as
our
steps
are
so
will
the
footprints
be
which
will
tell
the
story
of
our
life
if
we
had
a
score
of
lives
to
live
how
to
live
this
one
would
not
be
of
such
great
moment
we
should
then
have
nineteen
lives
in
which
to
correct
the
errors
and
sins
of
this
one
but
alas
we
have
but
one
what
then
should
we
seek
more
earnestly
than
to
know
i
how
to
live
we
doubt
not
but
there
is
in
the
heart
of
the
reader
a
strong
desire
to
live
life
as
it
should
be
lived
thank
god
you
can
you
desire
your
life
to
be
like
the
fertile
oasis
where
the
weary
traveler
refreshes
himself
you
have
seen
the
rays
of
light
lingering
upon
the
hillside
and
treetop
and
gilding
the
fleecy
cloud
after
the
sun
had
gone
down
you
desire
the
beautiful
rays
of
light
from
your
life
to
linger
long
after
your
sun
has
gone
down
you
can
have
it
that
way
the
deeds
you
do
will
live
after
you
are
gone
they
are
the
footprints
some
one
has
said
that
we
each
day
are
here
building
the
house
we
are
going
to
occupy
in
eternity
if
this
be
true
nothing
should
concern
us
so
much
as
how
to
live
some
men
are
devoting
their
time
and
the
power
of
their
intellects
to
invention
some
are
studying
statesmanship
some
are
studying
the
arts
others
the
sciences
but
we
have
come
to
learn
a
little
more
about
how
to
live
many
are
thinking
much
about
how
they
wish
to
die
but
let
us
learn
how
to
live
if
we
live
well
we
shall
die
well
since
we
have
but
one
life
to
live
and
with
it
we
must
face
eternity
i
am
sure
there
are
many
who
want
to
make
the
most
of
life
there
are
many
who
want
to
be
their
best
in
life
this
is
not
a
or
a
place
to
trifle
with
time
it
is
a
place
of
work
and
effort
a
place
of
purpose
and
earnestness
a
place
to
do
something
life
is
not
given
us
to
squander
nor
fritter
away
but
was
given
us
to
accomplish
a
purpose
in
the
mind
of
the
creator
if
we
will
set
ourselves
to
live
as
we
should
god
will
help
us
and
no
man
can
hinder
us
we
are
purchasing
treasures
for
eternity
by
making
a
proper
use
of
time
to
trifle
away
time
is
indeed
to
be
the
greatest
of
spendthrifts
if
you
squander
a
dollar
you
may
regain
it
but
a
moment
wasted
can
never
be
regained
there
is
great
responsibility
in
life
it
means
much
to
live
the
time
was
when
you
and
i
were
not
now
we
are
we
are
and
there
can
never
come
a
time
when
we
shall
not
be
you
and
i
shall
always
exist
somehow
somewhere
one
sweet
thought
to
me
is
that
i
have
time
enough
to
do
all
that
god
intends
for
me
to
do
and
do
it
well
then
comes
another
thought
a
thought
that
awes
the
good
that
i
do
the
sum
of
my
usefulness
will
be
less
than
it
should
be
if
i
spend
a
moment
of
time
uselessly
god
will
give
us
all
the
time
we
need
to
accomplish
all
he
purposes
us
to
accomplish
but
he
does
not
give
us
one
moment
to
trifle
away
the
mission
of
this
little
volume
is
to
strengthen
and
energize
and
help
you
to
spend
life
as
you
should
may
it
please
the
great
teacher
who
has
promised
to
show
us
the
path
of
life
to
bless
this
little
work
and
by
it
help
some
one
to
a
pure
and
noble
life
and
to
the
accomplishment
of
all

the

one
sails

how
can

and
that
with
selfsame
wind
that
blows
a
voice
made
answer
to
my
soul
is
not
how
blows
the
gale
each
voyager
decides
the
goal
by
way
he
sets
the
selected
how
to
live
a
holy
life
the
model
life
in
doing
anything
it
is
always
well
to
have
a
model
by
which
to
fashion
our
work
in
fact
nothing
is
done
without
a
pattern
either
real
or
imaginary
the
little
boy
making
a
toy
has
in
in
his
mind
a
model
by
which
he
is
framing
his
work
likewise
the
sculptor
has
in
his
mind
a
model
and
as
the
marble
wastes
the
image
grows
into
the
likeness
of
the
vision
in
his
soul
to
live
this
one
life
of
ours
as
it
should
be
lived
we
must
have
a
perfect
model
after
which
to
pattern
thank
god
this
perfect
model
of
life
can
be
found
of
all
the
vast
number
of
lives
that
have
been
lived
since
adam
down
to
this
present
day
there
has
been
only
one
that
we
can
take
as
a
model
this
one
is
the
life
of
jesus
he
says
i
am
the
life
to
live
this
life
of
ours
well
to
live
it
to
the
highest
degree
of
perfection
we
must
fashion
it
according
to
the
glorious
life
of
christ
the
life
of
jesus
is
the
model
life
for
every
other
human
life
he
invites
us
yea
commands
us
to
follow
him
to
step
in
his
steps
to
walk
as
he
walked
there
have
been
many
good
men
in
the
world
but
none
of
them
afford
us
a
true
pattern
of
life
there
was
a
man
who
said
be
ye
followers
of
me
but
he
immediately
added
even
as
i
also
am
of
christ
man
may
so
live
as
to
reveal
to
us
the
life
of
christ
we
can
then
follow
not
them
but
the
they
manifested
through
them
let
me
here
say
a
word
on
a
subject
on
which
we
may
have
more
to
say
hereafter
the
grandest
noblest
work
man
has
ever
done
is
by
his
life
to
reveal
the
life
of
christ
to
another
thereby
helping
that
person
to
be
fashioned
more
after
the
image
of
jesus
a
little
flower
grew
in
a
place
so
shaded
that
no
ray
from
the
sun
could
fall
directly
upon
it
a
window
was
so
situated
that
at
a
certain
time
in
the
afternoon
it
refracted
the
sun
rays
and
threw
them
upon
the
flower
thus
giving
it
color
and
beauty
and
aiding
it
to
bloom
some
people
are
living
in
the
dense
shade
no
light
from
christ
has
ever
shined
upon
them
if
you
so
live
as
to
refract
the
life
of
christ
and
turn
it
upon
them
and
thus
stamp
upon
them
a
holier
life
you
have
not
lived
in
vain
to
set
the
life
of
christ
in
its
purity
and
beauty
before
some
one
and
influence
him
though
only
a
little
to
live
better
and
love
jesus
more
is
a
work
the
worth
of
which
can
never
be
computed
he
who
helps
another
to
a
better
way
of
living
does
more
than
he
who
gains
great
worldly
honor
and
riches
blessed
indeed
is
that
life
which
causes
some
other
life
to
be
more
like
christ
oh
may
this
thought
seize
upon
our
hearts
and
fill
us
with
a
greater
passion
to
live
the
life
of
god
we
are
told
by
the
voice
of
scripture
to
be
followers
of
god
as
dear
children
when
children
are
dear
to
the
heart
of
the
parent
he
loves
to
have
them
obey
him
god
children
are
dear
to
him
and
he
would
have
them
follow
him
to
follow
god
is
to
imitate
him
or
be
like
him
this
is
the
true
way
of
life
a
text
of
scripture
as
rendered
by
the
revised
version
is
very
appropriate
here
like
as
he
which
has
called
you
is
holy
be
ye
yourselves
also
holy
in
all
manner
of
living
pet
only
those
who
live
godly
in
their
entire
manner
of
life
are
spending
the
days
of
their
pilgrimage
as
they
should
jesus
has
walked
the
true
way
of
life
we
are
told
to
walk
in
his
steps
if
we
will
step
each
day
just
where
jesus
stepped
then
on
looking
back
we
can
not
see
a
footprint
of
our
own
but
if
we
take
a
single
misstep
our
footprint
will
show
our
departure
from
the
true
way
of
life
how
deep
and
awful
are
the
words
of
scripture
wherein
we
are
commanded
to
walk
even
as
jesus
walked
jesus
says
i
am
the
way
there
is
no
other
right
and
perfect
way
if
we
will
walk
as
jesus
walked
then
we
shall
walk
in
the
true
path
of
life
this
only
is
the
pathway
that
leads
up
to
the
golden
gates
of
glory
and
the
sweet
fields
of
heaven
that
bright
world
of
bliss
encourages
us
on
if
we
will
follow
jesus
and
live
as
he
lived
god
approval
will
be
upon
us
and
his
outstretched
hand
will
help
us
along
life
way
and
finally
over
the
turbulent
river
of
death
to
the
sunlit
shore
of
eternal
rest
many
times
we
may
become
wearied
and
think
the
toils
of
the
way
almost
too
heavy
but
when
we
remember
that
it
is
the
way
that
jesus
trod
then
the
heavens
open
to
our
view
we
look
forward
to
the
mansion
prepared
for
us
and
the
toils
of
the
way
grow
lighter
see
that
aged
pilgrim
journeying
down
the
western
slope
of
life
the
sun
is
nearing
the
setting
long
and
toilsome
has
been
his
pilgrimage
but
he
has
walked
in
the
path
his
savior
trod
for
many
years
his
life
has
been
hid
with
christ
in
god
in
him
he
has
lived
and
moved
and
had
his
being
now
he
is
making
his
last
step
on
the
shore
of
time
he
passes
out
of
our
sight
through
the
gates
into
that
land
where
toils
are
ended
and
the
sun
never
sets
but
his
life
was
the
life
of
jesus
he
was
holy
as
god
is
holy
he
walked
as
jesus
walked
this
is
how
to
live
this
is
the
true
way
of
life
and
the
only
way
to
life
eternal
he
who
does
not
live
with
christ
on
earth
can
not
live
with
him
in
heaven
and
he
who
does
not
live
as
jesus
lived
does
not
live
as
he
should
the
life
of
christ
was
the
perfect
life
ours
is
perfect
to
the
degree
that
we
imitate
him
take
my
life
o
christ
divine
make
it
holy
just
like
thine
every
act
and
thought
and
word
be
an
outflow
from
my
god
guide
my
feet
and
keep
my
heart
let
me
not
from
thee
depart
let
me
breathe
thy
warming
love
that
my
soul
be
drawn
above
draw
me
jesus
closer
draw
thy
strong
arm
around
me
throw
draw
me
to
thy
pierced
side
in
thy
bosom
let
me
hide
teach
me
all
thy
will
and
word
that
my
life
be
filled
with
god
teach
me
lamb
of
calvary
how
to
live
this
life
for
thee
how
to
live
the
man
can
not
naturally
live
the
but
christ
has
promised
to
come
into
our
hearts
and
live
in
us
in
order
that
we
may
have
christ
dwell
in
our
hearts
and
that
we
may
live
his
life
there
must
be
a
giving
up
of
our
there
must
be
annihilation
of
self
that
christ
may
live
it
is
truly
wonderful
and
as
glorious
as
it
is
wonderful
that
man
can
live
the
life
of
christ
in
this
world
but
here
is
the
secret
it
is
man
ceasing
to
live
the
and
christ
living
in
him
imagine
a
hollow
brass
figure
in
the
exact
image
of
a
man
suppose
you
fill
this
hollow
figure
with
a
kind
of
life
which
we
shall
call
this
life
goes
to
using
the
hands
and
feet
and
eyes
ears
tongue
in
short
all
the
members
of
this
brass
figure
but
using
them
in
the
interest
of
itself
now
you
desire
to
make
a
change
you
want
that
image
to
speak
act
and
think
only
for
you
you
must
first
put
to
death
the
life
that
is
using
the
figure
cleanse
it
entirely
out
and
then
get
into
it
yourself
once
in
you
can
use
all
the
members
of
that
image
for
yourself
your
body
is
that
image
there
was
a
life
in
you
that
used
all
the
members
of
your
body
in
the
interest
of
self
but
there
has
been
a
change
you
were
made
a
new
creature
the
life
you
once
had
was
put
to
death
was
crucified
then
christ
stepped
into
your
heart
and
now
he
uses
all
the
members
of
your
body
for
himself
you
still
live
yet
not
you
but
christ
lives
in
you
once
you
did
things
for
yourself
now
you
do
them
for
christ
just
as
you
once
lived
purposely
and
intentionally
for
yourself
now
you
do
things
purposely
and
intentionally
for
jesus
because
it
is
he
that
lives
and
not
you
yourself
you
remember
how
once
you
would
plan
for
yourself
in
the
evening
as
you
lay
upon
your
bed
and
again
in
the
morning
and
throughout
the
day
you
would
think
about
what
you
were
going
to
eat
or
drink
what
you
were
going
to
have
for
clothing
where
you
were
going
to
live
where
you
were
going
to
go
and
what
you
were
going
to
do
but
now
you
are
changed
you
are
a
new
creature
now
it
is
not
you
that
lives
but
christ
lives
in
you
now
you
eat
not
for
yourself
but
for
jesus
you
now
go
not
where
self
would
lead
you
but
where
that
life
in
you
loves
to
go
and
would
have
you
go
you
do
things
not
for
yourself
but
for
jesus
o
christ
i
die
that
thou
mayst
live
that
thou
mayst
live
in
me
that
all
i
think
or
speak
or
do
may
be
o
lord
for
thee
may
not
the
least
of
self
remain
but
all
be
put
to
death
oh
may
i
nothing
do
for
self
nor
draw
one
selfish
breath
to
have
my
savior
live
in
me
to
occupy
the
whole
to
make
my
heart
his
royal
throne
and
take
complete
control
is
all
i
ask
is
all
i
wish
is
all
my
heart
desire
content
if
but
a
wayside
bush
to
hold
god
holy
fire
low
at
thy
feet
o
christ
i
fall
a
yielded
lump
of
clay
for
thee
to
mold
me
as
thou
wilt
to
have
thy
own
sweet
way
the
bible
way
if
the
bible
had
not
been
given
us
we
should
not
always
know
the
way
that
jesus
walked
but
he
has
given
us
his
word
the
way
of
the
bible
is
the
way
of
christ
and
is
therefore
the
true
path
of
life
o
pilgrim
to
the
heavenly
kingdom
the
word
of
god
will
be
a
lamp
unto
thy
feet
and
a
light
unto
thy
way
it
will
lighten
you
home
there
will
never
be
a
day
so
dark
but
the
beams
of
light
from
the
blessed
bible
will
pierce
through
the
darkness
and
fall
with
a
bright
radiance
upon
your
pathway
if
sometimes
you
can
not
see
just
where
jesus
stepped
take
the
precious
book
of
god
and
it
will
be
a
lamp
to
show
you
the
way
he
trod
one
wintry
morning
a
father
went
a
long
distance
through
the
deep
snow
to
feed
his
sheep
a
few
hours
later
a
little
boy
was
sent
to
call
his
father
home
the
child
was
carefully
stepping
in
the
footprints
before
him
but
soon
a
dark
cloud
arose
and
the
blinding
so
dimmed
his
eye
that
he
frequently
stepped
aside
in
the
beautiful
clear
light
of
the
bible
we
can
see
all
the
way
that
jesus
trod
if
we
will
walk
according
to
the
bible
we
shall
walk
as
jesus
walked
and
not
show
a
double
track
make
the
blessed
word
of
god
your
guide
if
you
would
walk
aright
the
path
of
life
and
be
happy
and
often
for
your
comfort
you
will
read
the
guide
and
chart
it
has
wisdom
for
the
mind
and
sweet
solace
for
the
heart
it
will
serve
you
as
a
mentor
it
will
guide
you
sure
and
straight
all
the
time
that
you
will
journey
be
the
ending
soon
or
late
scriptures
are
given
by
inspiration
of
god
and
are
profitable
for
doctrine
for
reproof
for
correction
for
instruction
in
righteousness
that
the
man
of
god
may
be
perfect
tim
if
by
faith
we
receive
into
our
hearts
the
instruction
in
righteousness
as
given
by
the
scriptures
it
will
make
us
perfect
in
this
life
o
reader
if
you
would
know
how
to
live
study
the
bible
it
points
out
the
way
clearly
and
plainly
let
its
truths
in
all
their
power
reach
to
the
depth
of
thy
heart
let
thy
soul
seize
upon
the
bible
and
drink
its
strength
and
sweetness
as
the
bee
sips
the
sweetness
from
the
flower
as
the
animal
eats
the
plant
and
by
assimilation
converts
it
into
animal
life
so
eat
the
book
of
god
and
convert
it
into
human
life
it
is
the
food
of
angels
but
rather
than
its
being
the
bible
converted
into
human
life
it
is
human
life
transformed
into
the
purity
of
the
bible
there
are
great
depths
to
the
bible
the
simplest
text
contains
depths
to
which
we
can
ever
be
descending
they
who
would
live
a
perfect
life
must
set
the
life
of
christ
before
them
as
portrayed
by
the
holy
scriptures
you
can
not
see
much
of
this
perfect
life
by
a
passing
glance
it
is
he
who
looks
into
the
perfect
law
of
liberty
and
continues
to
look
that
will
see
the
perfect
life
which
it
pictures
the
artist
must
look
long
at
the
landscape
and
get
it
imaged
upon
his
soul
before
he
can
produce
it
upon
the
canvas
the
bible
description
of
the
life
of
christ
must
fill
your
soul
with
admiration
and
with
a
strong
desire
to
possess
it
your
heart
must
lay
hold
upon
it
until
that
life
is
focused
and
printed
upon
your
own
soul
it
is
like
the
art
of
photographing
the
object
must
be
set
before
the
heart
the
bible
is
the
light
that
shines
the
image
of
christ
upon
the
soul
for
the
pure
in
heart
to
develop
into
higher
spiritual
life
they
must
gain
such
an
admiration
for
the
beauty
of
christ
that
they
will
long
to
possess
him
in
greater
fulness
the
pleading
of
the
heart
will
be
lord
let
thy
beauty
be
upon
us
their
souls
will
follow
hard
after
his
perfections
in
no
other
way
will
the
soul
unfold
and
develop
into
the
higher
christian
life
he
who
has
not
learned
how
to
grow
in
grace
has
not
yet
learned
how
to
live
to
live
life
in
the
best
possible
manner
is
to
be
making
constant
progress
oh
let
us
give
this
world
our
best
life
when
we
are
nearing
the
end
of
the
way
and
life
sun
is
sinking
low
if
on
looking
back
we
can
see
nothing
but
a
life
spent
in
the
service
of
god
walking
in
the
light
of
his
word
this
will
afford
us
untold
satisfaction
o
blessed
word
of
eternal
life
the
lamp
to
guide
the
way
through
this
weary
world
of
sin
and
strife
to
heaven
perfect
day
the
heavenly
way
there
is
a
heaven
there
is
a
place
of
rest
and
happiness
i
have
not
gone
to
heaven
but
heaven
has
come
to
me
therefore
i
know
there
is
a
heaven
many
who
have
eaten
oranges
have
never
been
in
a
land
where
oranges
grow
but
these
persons
know
there
must
be
such
a
land
because
they
have
tasted
its
fruit
likewise
i
know
there
is
a
heaven
because
i
daily
taste
its
joy
not
only
is
there
a
heaven
but
there
is
a
way
to
heaven
all
can
go
who
will
heaven
is
a
holy
place
and
the
way
to
heaven
is
a
holy
way
a
prophet
of
god
said
an
highway
shall
be
there
and
a
way
and
it
shall
be
called
the
way
of
holiness
the
christian
dwells
in
a
heavenly
place
the
writer
to
the
saints
at
ephesus
says
he
hath
raised
us
up
together
and
made
us
sit
together
in
heavenly
places
to
live
in
a
heavenly
place
we
must
live
a
heavenly
life
those
who
do
not
live
a
heavenly
life
on
earth
will
never
live
in
heaven
the
heavenly
life
is
the
only
life
worth
living
it
is
the
only
life
that
ends
in
heaven
the
way
of
holiness
is
the
way
of
happiness
holy
and
happy
is
the
true
and
right
life
of
man
this
one
brief
life
of
ours
should
be
constant
holiness
and
happiness
without
these
life
is
not
as
it
should
be
it
is
our
privilege
in
christ
to
walk
the
path
of
life
in
perfect
peace
and
joy
and
in
perfect
holiness
such
a
life
will
flow
out
into
an
eternity
of
joys
unspeakable
wait
thou
on
god
o
soul
of
mine
listen
to
know
his
will
light
will
come
from
the
golden
throne
if
thou
o
soul
be
still
if
thou
wouldst
sail
on
tranquil
sea
wait
thou
on
god
my
soul
speak

and
think
alone
in
him
sweet
rest
shall
be
thy
goal
if

up
and
on
this
high
and
holy
way
keeping
the
commandments
god
word
is
pure
heaven
itself
and
the
great
white
throne
is
no
more
pure
than
the
word
of
god
that
life
may
be
pure
it
must
be
in
sweet
harmony
with
the
blessed
bible
a
life
that
is
lived
in
obedience
to
the
bible
is
as
pure
as
the
bible
such
a
life
is
pure
enough
for
heaven
the
writer
of
revelation
being
in
the
spirit
saw
a
pure
river
of
water
of
life
clear
as
crystal
proceeding
out
of
the
throne
of
god
and
of
the
lamb
this
pure
stream
was
the
wonderful
word
of
life
it
was
as
pure
as
its
source
which
was
the
throne
of
god
the
life
through
which
this
pure
stream
flows
will
be
as
pure
as
the
throne
one
of
the
said
the
words
of
the
lord
are
pure
words
as
silver
tried
in
a
furnace
of
earth
purified
seven
times
thy
word
is
pure
therefore
thy
servant
loveth
it
the
writer
of
proverbs
says
every
word
of
god
is
pure
when
the
veil
is
drawn
aside
and
our
souls
are
brought
face
to
face
with
the
purity
of
the
bible
then
we
understand
that
a
bible
life
is
the
best
purest
noblest
and
holiest
life
that
can
be
lived
upon
the
earth
o
soul
of
mine
unveil
thine
eye

upward
to
thy
god
a
wreath
of
purity
to
see
crowning
his
every
word
in
the
following
words
we
have
the
sum
of
all
true
and
right
living
let
us
hear
the
conclusion
of
the
whole
matter
fear
god
and
keep
his
commandments
for
this
is
the
whole
duty
of
man
eccl
this
text
as
rendered
in
the
septuagint
version
brings
out
clearer
the
true
signification
hear
the
end
of
the
matter
the
sum
fear
god
and
keep
his
commandments
for
this
is
the
whole
man
man
is
not
entire
he
is
not
complete
as
originally
intended
when
not
keeping
all
the
commands
of
god
something
is
lacking
in
the
life
that
is
not
in
full
obedience
to
every
word
of
god
the
bible
speaks
of
a
beautiful
city
in
that
bright
celestial
world
it
is
a
city
of
pure
gold
clear
as
glass
its
walls
are
of
jasper
its
twelve
foundations
are
garnished
with
all

of
precious
stones

twelve
gates
are

no
pain
no
sickness
sorrow
and
trouble
never
come
there
a
tear
shall
never
fall
from
any
eye
for
no
tears
are
there
there
is
no
death
in
that
wonderful
city
so
fair
in
the
midst
of
the
street
stands
the
tree
of
life
oh
who
does
not
desire
to
dwell
forever
and
forever
in
that
city
of
love
and
light
when
the
pains
and
sorrows
the
trials
and
tears
of
this
weary
life
are
over
listen
while
i
read
to
you
in
accents
clear
distinct
and
unmistakable
blessed
are
they
that
do
his
commandments
that
they
may
have
right
to
the
tree
of
life
and
may
enter
in
through
the
gates
into
the
city
rev
o
traveler
to
eternity
your
entrance
into
the
beautiful
glorious
city
of
god
depends
upon
your
conduct
respecting
the
commandments
of
god
while
you
are
making
the
journey
across
the
turbulent
sea
of
life
keeping
the
commandments
of
god
is
man
whole
duty
if
he
does
his
whole
duty
through
life
he
will
come
up
out
of
the
dark
valley
and
shadow
of
death
and
find
the
gates
of
pearl
unfolding
who
will
not
cleave
to
the
commandments
of
god
who
will
not
obey
his
voice
and
walk
daily
in
his
holy
ways
the
obedient
will
be
rewarded
by
an
unfading
inheritance
in
that
eternal
city
of
gold
there
is
a
beautiful
mansion
in
the
great
house
of
god
for
every
obedient
soul
oh
how
blessed
i
am
thinking
of
heaven
tonight
of
the
mansion
prepared
there
for
me
where
jesus
my
savior
now
dwells
and
where
i
am
longing
to
be
will
not
heaven
be
well
worth
a
life
of
obedience
to
the
word
of
god
though
obedience
calls
us
through
storms
of
persecutions
furnaces
of
trials
oceans
of
tribulations
and
years
of
toil
and
suffering
to
moses
the
reproaches
of
christ
were
greater
treasures
than
the
riches
of
egypt
for
he
had
respect
unto
the
recompense
of
the
reward
sit
quiet
for
a
moment
and
by
a
strong
eye
of
faith
look
away
into
heaven
and
see
that
bright
mansion
prepared
for
you
see
those
jasper
walls
those
pearly
gates
and
those
golden
walks
see
the
crown
of
life
the
harp
of
god
and
the
light
of
the
lamb
shall
we
not
bear
the
trials
of
life
a
little
longer
in
patience
shall
we
not
be
watchful
to
walk
in
god
ways
and
obey
him
that
this
rich
inheritance
may
be
ours
forever
methinks
i
can
hear
a
reply
coming
from
the
depths
of
many
a
sincere
trusting
heart
yes
i
will
live
in
humble
obedience
to
god
on
earth
that
i
may
be
with
him
forever
in
that
celestial
city
of
light
god
bless
you
beyond
the
shores
of
time
and
the
kingdoms
of
this
world
is
a
kingdom
called
the
kingdom
of
heaven
it
is
the
place
where
god
has
his
great
white
throne
around
which
the
angels
play
upon
their
golden
harps
and
shout
blessing
and
honor
and
glory
and
praise
and
might
be
unto
god
forever
and
ever
it
is
around
this
throne
that
those
who
have
passed
through
the
tribulations
and
the
trying
scenes
of
this
lower
world
and
burst
through
the
gates
of
death
are
singing
redemption
sweet
song
who
does
not
desire
to
join
that
happy
heavenly
throng
and
wave
those
palms
and
wear
those
white
robes
and
sing
those
sweet
songs
over
beyond
the
shadowy
vale
of
death
i
seem
to
hear
many
voices
saying
i
hope
to
be
among
that
throng
let
me
tell
you
in
all
tenderness
and
love
but
very
plainly
that
the
realization
of
your
hope
depends
entirely
upon
how
you
live
while
here
in
this
world
oh
how
much
in
that
great
and
awful
future
is
depending
upon
our
manner
of
life
in
this
let
us
learn
to
live
well
to
be
our
best
every
day
we
may
dream
of
a
home
in
heaven
we
may
entertain
hopes
of
seeing
jesus
and
of
inheriting
a
mansion
on
the
shores
of
eternal
bliss
we
may
imagine
ourselves
walking
through
the
blooming
fields
of
paradise
and
sitting
beneath
the
tree
of
life
but
our
dreams
our
hopes
and
our
imaginations
will
never
be
realized
unless
we
carefully
keep
the
commandments
of
god
more
than
a
profession
is
necessary
obedience
is
the
only
door
into
the
kingdom
of
god
jesus
said
not
every
one
that
sayeth
unto
me
lord
lord
shall
enter
the
kingdom
of
heaven
but
he
that
doeth
the
will
of
my
father
which
is
in
heaven
until
our
faith
pierces
through
and
beholds
the
beauties
and
the
realities
of
god
so
we
can
say
from
the
very
depths
of
the
soul
i
delight
to
do
thy
will
o
god
and
my
meat
and
my
drink
is
to
do
the
will
of
him
that
sent
me
we
have
not
fully
entered
the
true
and
right
pathway
of
life
keeping
the
commands
of
god
is
the
whole
man
and
the
whole
of
a
perfect
life
be
doers
of
the
word
i
want
to
remind
you
again
that
the
mission
of
this
little
volume
is
to
teach
you
how
to
live
the
life
beyond
depends
on
the
life
here
let
me
emphasize
what
i
have
repeatedly
said
before
to
live
as
we
should
we
must
live
by
every
word
of
god
to
live
by
every
word
of
god
is
not
only
to
hear
it
but
also
to
do
it
we
have
learned
that
in
order
to
enter
the
city
of
god
and
eat
of
the
tree
of
life
we
must
i
do
his
commandments
and
also
that
it
is
not
every
one
that
sayeth
lord
lord
that
shall
enter
the
kingdom
of
heaven
but
he
that
doeth
the
will
of
my
father
which
is
in
heaven
now
i
will
read
you
a
text
from
the
epistle
of
james
but
be
ye
doers
of
the
word
and
not
hearers
only
deceiving
your
own
selves
we
are
living
in
a
careless
age
the
word
of
god
is
being
treated
with
neglect
many
are
hearing
it
but
alas
how
few
are
doing
it
in
this
way
people
deceive
themselves
they
think
they
are
on
their
way
to
heaven
when
they
are
not
the
only
way
to
heaven
is
by
doing
the
commandments
to
illustrate
this
i
will
refer
you
to
a
few
texts
if
thine
enemy
hunger
feed
him
rom
whosoever
shall
smite
thee
on
thy
right
cheek
turn
to
him
the
other
also
matt
and
as
ye
would
that
men
should
do
to
you
do
ye
also
to
them
likewise
luke
if
it
comes
most
natural
for
us
to
live
according
to
these
texts
we
can
begin
to
conclude
that
our
hearts
are
right
with
god
however
we
must
have
a
heart
that
does
not
rebel
against
any
text
in
the
bible
we
are
exhorted
earnestly
by
the
apostle
peter
to
make
our
calling
and
election
sure
the
only
way
to
do
so
is
to
live
to
every
word
of
god
oh
my
dear
reader
those
sweet
hopes
you
have
had
of
reaching
heaven
and
of
seeing
jesus
and
those
dear
loved
ones
who
have
gone
before
you
to
that
other
side
will
never
be
realized
by
you
unless
you
be
a
diligent
doer
of
the
word
of
god
i
feel
like
warning
you
against
all
carelessness
and
neglect
and
to
keep
yourself
in
the
love
of
god
see
that
your
heart
and
life
reads
each
day
as
the
bible
reads
and
you
will
then
have
an
unshaken
foundation
for
your
faith
and
hope
if
you
would
know
how
to
live
and
make
the
best
of
life
read
the
bible
much
and
conform
your
life
to
its
teaching
who
are
the
wise
who
is
a
foolish
man
it
is
a
man
who
hears
the
sayings
of
jesus
and
fails
to
do
them
he
is
likened
to
a
man
who
was
foolish
enough
to
build
his
house
upon
the
sand
this
man
would
better
not
have
built
at
all
for
the
cost
of
building
was
lost
he
could
have
had
the
money
for
his
use
and
enjoyment
if
he
had
not
wasted
it
in
building
a
house
on
the
sand
a
foolish
man
indeed
who
is
a
wise
man
it
is
the
man
who
hears
the
sayings
of
jesus
and
does
them
he
is
likened
to
a
man
who
built
his
house
upon
a
rock
from
a
temporal
standpoint
nothing
else
is
so
conducive
to
man
happiness
as
a
good
home
no
better
use
can
be
made
of
money
than
to
spend
it
in
the
building
of
a
home
provided
the
house
be
built
upon
a
sure
foundation
a
man
who
hears
god
word
and
does
it
is
likened
to
such
a
man
to
build
up
a
christian
character
in
obedience
to
the
bible
is
the
greatest
wisdom
that
is
building
a
mansion
in
heaven
a
real
true
christian
experience
and
life
cost
something
but
they
pay
because
they
will
stand
a
mere
profession
of
christianity
may
cost
something
also
but
it
does
not
pay
since
it
will
not
stand
a
man
who
erects
his
house
upon
the
sand
can
build
at
less
cost
than
he
who
digs
deep
and
lays
his
foundation
upon
the
rock
but
at
the
very
time
when
the
former
man
most
needs
his
house
when
the
winds
blow
and
the
rain
falls
that
is
when
it
is
destroyed
on
the
other
hand
the
man
who
builds
upon
a
rock
has
a
house
to
shelter
him
through
the
storms
likewise
he
who
builds
up
a
christian
experience
in
obedience
to
the
word
of
god
will
have
something
to
serve
him
in
a
time
of
need
we
thus
learn
from
jesus
parable
of
the
wise
and
the
foolish
house
that
obeying
the
bible
is
the
true
way
of
life
keeping
the
commandments
a
test
of
love
we
are
commanded
to
love
god
it
is
the
first
and
greatest
commandment
love
is
more
than
an
emotion
it
is
an
act
of
the
will
a
mother
loves
her
child
constantly
though
she
may
not
always
experience
the
emotions
of
love
her
care
for
her
child
is
a
proof
of
her
love
we
may
not
always
experience
a
feeling
of
love
toward
god
but
we
can
always
love
him
our
love
is
measured
not
by
our
emotions
but
by
our
obedience
our
service
we
labor
for
those
we
love
and
the
love
makes
the
labor
light
it
is
not
an
irksome
thing
to
obey
god
when
we
love
him
it
is
possible
to
make
a
profession
of
love
to
god
and
not
really
love
him
it
may
be
that
many
are
deceived
at
this
point
one
scripture
says
if
any
man
love
god
the
same
is
known
of
him
jesus
says
why
call
ye
me
lord
lord
and
do
not
the
things
which
i
say
love
is
something
more
than
mere
words
it
is
useless
to
make
a
profession
of
love
to
jesus
and
not
do
what
he
says
a
husband
can
not
convince
his
wife
of
his
love
by
a
mere
profession
of
love
but
he
can
convince
her
by
his
acts
we
are
to
love
not
in
word
and
tongue
only
but
also
in
deed
and
in
truth
again
jesus
says
if
a
man
love
me
he
will
keep
my
words
here
is
an
unfailing
test
of
love
if
you
will
not
obey
god
he
knows
you
do
not
love
him
no
matter
how
much
you
may
profess
to
love
him
so
again
we
are
reminded
by
the
holy
bible
that
in
order
to
spend
this
brief
life
of
ours
as
we
should
we
must
keep
the
commandments
of
god
no
other
life
will
find
acceptance
with
god
no
other
life
will
please
him
he
desires
your
love
most
certainly
but
he
wants
such
love
as
will
prompt
you
to
obey
him
do
not
measure
your
christian
experience
by
your
feelings
but
measure
it
by
your
obedience
as
proceeding
from
an
internal
principle
when
you
find
something
in
your
heart
that
causes
you
to
obey
god
no
matter
how
you
feel
you
have
good
reason
to
hope
that
you
are
a
christian
in
subsequent
chapters
i
will
tell
you
something
of
what
god
word
teaches
but
first
of
all
i
desire
to
fully
convince
you
and
to
help
you
to
feel
that
the
right
and
true
way
of
life
is
in
obedience
to
its
teaching
the
blessedness
of
obeying
god
word
everything
is
said
in
the
scriptures
that
can
be
said
to
show
us
the
need
of
living
in
harmony
with
the
bible
if
our
lives
are
out
of
harmony
with
one
text
in
that
blessed
book
we
are
not
yet
fitted
for
heaven
we
can
never
be
admitted
into
the
everlasting
kingdom
of
god
if
we
knowingly
refuse
or
neglect
to
live
to
every
word
of
god
we
are
therefore
exhorted
beseeched
entreated
encouraged
warned
and
commanded
to
obey
every
text
in
the
bible
we
are
encouraged
to
obedience
by
being
told
of
the
blessedness
of
keeping
the
commandments
it
is
natural
for
mothers
to
love
to
have
their
children
well
spoken
of
we
do
not
fault
them
for
this
when
a
young
man
by
his
good
deportment
is
gaining
a
fair
name
mothers
when
together
will
remark
it
is
blessed
to
be
the
mother
of
a
young
man
like
that
there
was
a
woman
who
heard
of
the
fame
of
a
young
man
he
was
casting
out
devils
healing
the
sick
opening
blinded
eyes
and
unstopping
deaf
ears
and
consequently
he
was
gaining
a
wide
and
favorable
reputation
this
woman
came
to
the
young
man
and
with
that
mother
in
her
heart
said
to
him
blessed
is
the
womb
that
bear
thee
and
the
paps
which
thou
hast
sucked
it
was
indeed
blessed
to
be
the
mother
of
this
young
man
an
angel
from
heaven
acknowledged
this
in
speaking
to
mary
of
the
birth
of
jesus
for
he
was
the
young
man
the
angel
said
hail
thou
that
are
highly
favored
the
lord
is
with
thee
blessed
art
thou
among
women
she
was
more
highly
favored
than
any
other
woman
on
earth
because
she
was
to
become
the
mother
of
the
son
of
god
can
it
be
that
any
one
can
be
more
blessed
than
this
happy
mother
of
jesus
let
us
hear
his
reply
to
the
woman
but
he
said
yea
rather
blessed
are
they
that
hear
the
word
of
god
and
keep
it
jesus
did
not
deny
that
it
was
blessed
to
be
his
mother
but
said
that
those
who
hear
god
word
and
keep
it
are
rather
or
more
blessed
god
favors
those
who
obey
him
the
willing
and
obedient
shall
eat
the
good
of
the
land
hadst
thou
hearkened
unto
my
commandments
then
wouldst
thy
peace
be
like
a
river
happiness
is
the
result
of
obedience
and
heaven
is
the
final
reward
the
relationship
we
have
with
christ
through
obedience
the
reason
why
it
is
more
blessed
to
obey
the
word
of
god
than
to
be
the
mother
of
jesus
is
obvious
spiritual
things
are
higher
than
physical
things
spiritual
relation
is
closer
than
natural
relation
brotherhood
in
christ
is
closer
than
brotherhood
in
the
flesh
a
brother
in
the
spirit
is
dearer
to
us
than
a
son
of
our
own
mother
obedience
to
god
makes
us
one
with
god
mary
was
the
mother
of
jesus
after
the
flesh
but
god
children
enjoy
such
a
relation
after
the
spirit
at
one
time
somebody
brought
word
to
jesus
that
his
mother
and
his
brethren
stood
outside
desiring
to
see
him
but
he
answered
and
said
unto
him
that
told
him
who
is
my
mother
and
who
are
my
brethren
and
he
stretched
forth
his
hand
toward
his
disciples
and
said
behold
my
mother
and
my
brethren
for
whoever
shall
do
the
will
of
my
father
which
is
in
heaven
the
same
is
my
brother
and
sister
and
mother
matt
every
one
who
desires
to
spend
life
in
the
highest
possible
degree
of
perfection
should
make
a
constant
study
of
the
bible
and
should
carefully
and
diligently
obey
all
its
precepts
doing
this
will
bring
him
into
the
closest
possible
relationship
with
god
and
will
make
life
the
best
man
can
live
our
life
is
to
adorn
the
gospel
to
adorn
is
to
make
attractive
to
beautify
we
are
exhorted
by
the
apostle
paul
to
adorn
the
doctrine
of
the
new
testament
by
our
life
this
thought
should
be
a
powerful
incentive
to
close
living
with
god
and
assiduously
keeping
all
of
his
commandments
who
would
not
take
pleasure
in
adorning
the
teachings
of
jesus
by
a
pure
life
this
is
the
joy
of
the
christian
heart
he
cares
nothing
for
the
adornings
of
the
world
but
oh
that
he
may
so
live
as
to
make
beautiful
the
blessed
bible
this
is
happiness
enough
to
him
in
another
of
the
pauline
epistles
we
are
commanded
to
let
our
manner
of
life
be
as
it
becometh
the
gospel
of
christ
to
become
is
also
to
make
attractive
or
to
give
a
better
appearance
to
an
article
of
dress
is
becoming
to
us
when
it
gives
us
a
better
appearance
we
speak
of
any
bad
conduct
as
not
being
becoming
to
him
we
are
to
become
the
gospel
of
christ
by
holy
living
when
a
life
is
lived
as
god
designed
that
life
should
be
that
life
will
be
an
adornment
to
the
scriptures
god
will
beautify
his
children
with
the
glories
of
his
redeeming
grace
he
will
adorn
them
with
a
meek
and
quiet
spirit
which
in
his
sight
is
very
precious
that
they
in
turn
may
adorn
his
commandments
as
a
bride
decks
herself
with
jewels
so
the
heavenly
father
beautifies
his
children
with
the
robe
of
righteousness
the
life
of
a
christian
is
god
special
treasure
they
shall
be
mine
says
the
lord
in
that
day
when
i
make
up
my
jewels
or
special
treasure
as
rendered
by
the
margin
see
mal
by
reading
the
context
we
learn
that
it
is
those
who
fear
the
lord
that
are
his
jewels
to
fear
god
and
keep
his
commandments
is
man
whole
duty
it
is
a
perfect
life
such
a
life
is
the
lord
jewel
such
a
life
is
recorded
in
heaven
oh
how
animating
is
such
knowledge
how
it
strengthens
our
hearts
to
live
a
righteous
life
to
live
a
life
that
is
worthy
to
be
recorded
in
heaven
and
is
a
special
treasure
to
god
is
truly
wonderful
our
souls
are
awed
by
such
a
thought
oh
how
it
ought
to
move
our
hearts
to
carefulness
in
life
how
diligent
we
should
be
to
walk
as
worthy
citizens
of
our
heavenly
state
some
day
the
lord
will
come
and
gather
up
these
holy
lives
and
place
them
in
his
heavenly
courts
above
where
they
shall
shine
as
the
stars
forever
oh
take
this
life
this
life
of
mine
to
thee
o
god
is
freely
given
and
polish
it
that
it
may
shine
and
ornament
thy
word
divine
the
christian
an
epistle
of
christ
the
life
we
live
is
being
read
we
are
not
going
through
the
world
unnoticed
some
one
is
looking
on
and
some
one
is
to
some
extent
fashioning
his
life
after
ours
our
life
each
day
is
being
written
down
in
some
one
memory
my
own
dear
children
group
around
me
at
times
and
talk
of
their
mother
who
has
gone
to
heaven
her
pure
and
holy
life
written
in
their
memory
is
read
over
and
over
to
each
other
and
to
me
she
still
lives
as
an
epistle
in
their
hearts
they
read
her
daily
life
while
she
was
with
them
and
they
continue
to
read
it
since
she
is
gone
christians
are
said
to
be
the
epistle
of
christ
cor
to
read
their
life
is
to
read
the
life
of
jesus
all
the
bible
that
many
will
ever
read
is
what
they
read
in
the
lives
of
christians
life
will
be
read
just
as
it
is
not
as
it
may
pretend
to
be
it
is
not
what
we
pretend
to
be
but
what
we
really
are
that
will
go
down
in
the
memory
of
others
those
who
read
our
lives
have
a
way
of
reading
between
the
lines
we
should
strive
not
so
much
to
make
life
holy
as
to
be
holy
if
you
are
holy
then
live
just
what
you
are
we
should
never
strive
to
be
what
we
are
not
the
only
way
whereby
the
bible
may
be
read
in
the
life
is
to
get
it
in
the
heart
people
will
never
read
the
word
of
god
in
your
life
simply
because
you
have
a
neat
little
testament
in
your
pocket
or
a
large
family
bible
on
your
center
table
the
bible
can
get
into
the
life
only
by
beginning
at
the
heart
there
is
power
in
the
word
of
god
but
it
works
from
within
let
the
word
of
christ
dwell
in
you
richly
it
will
transform
the
life
so
that
the
life
will
read
just
like
the
holy
scriptures
the
word
of
god
is
a
lamp
to
light
us
into
a
holy
life
if
we
follow
its
instructions
in
righteousness
it
will
make
us
perfect
it
reveals
our
imperfections
and
thus
gives
us
an
opportunity
to
make
improvements
to
discover
an
imperfection
in
the
life
is
not
a
bad
thing
and
we
need
not
think
we
are
any
the
worse
for
the
discovery
it
is
only
when
we
let
the
imperfection
remain
after
it
is
revealed
to
us
that
we
become
worse
the
heart
that
comes
under
the
influence
of
the
bible
will
bear
the
image
of
jesus
but
of
this
i
shall
have
more
to
say
elsewhere
so
i
conclude
here
by
saying
live
upon
the
word
of
god
desire
the
sincere
milk
of
the
word
and
you
will
be
an
epistle
of
christ
we
should
feel
the
responsibility
that
is
upon
us
remembering
that
all
the
bible
some
will
ever
read
is
what
they
read
in
your
life
and
mine
oh
let
us
see
that
it
reads
in
our
life
as
it
does
in
the
book
lest
those
who
follow
us
will
not
walk
in
the
footprints
of
jesus
how
we
may
live
as
the
bible
reads
it
is
just
as
natural
and
easy
for
a
christian
to
live
the
christian
life
as
it
is
for
a
sinner
to
live
a
sinful
life
the
sinner
needs
make
no
effort
to
live
a
sinful
life
he
lives
it
naturally
and
easily
life
proceeds
from
the
heart
the
heart
is
the
fountain
and
the
life
is
the
stream
as
the
fountain
is
so
the
stream
will
be
it
is
not
difficult
to
live
a
christian
life
when
our
hearts
are
pure
this
is
the
secret
of
purity
of
life
the
important
question
then
is
how
can
i
have
a
pure
heart
hearts
are
made
pure
by
the
blood
of
jesus
then
comes
the
command
keep
thyself
pure
that
the
heart
may
be
kept
pure
it
must
be
kept
filled
with
that
which
is
pure
to
keep
darkness
out
of
a
room
we
need
only
to
keep
it
filled
with
light
carefully
closing
up
every
crevice
will
not
suffice
if
the
light
goes
out
darkness
will
be
present
but
simply
keep
the
room
filled
with
light
and
no
effort
is
required
to
keep
darkness
out
in
like
manner
no
effort
need
be
made
to
keep
impurity
out
of
the
heart
and
keep
the
heart
filled
with
that
which
is
pure
but
what
is
pure
the
word
of
god
is
pure
as
silver
tried
in
a
furnace
of
fire
purified
seven
times
thy
word
is
very
pure
therefore
thy
servant
loveth
it
let
the
word
of
christ
dwell
in
you
richly
and
your
heart
will
be
kept
pure
the
said
thy
word
have
i
hid
in
my
heart
that
i
may
not
sin
against
thee
here
is
the
only
way
to
a
sinless
life
keep
the
heart
filled
with
the
word
of
god
it
is
the
way
to
live
as
the
bible
reads
to
have
a
nicely
bound
volume
of
the
scriptures
lying
on
the
center
table
will
not
keep
the
life
sinless
we
must
have
the
word
in
our
heart
one
night
while
i
was
waiting
for
a
train
in
one
of
our
large
eastern
cities
i
went
into
a
mission
a
man
arose
and
said
he
had
read
the
bible
through
times
and
could
quote
whole
books
of
it
from
memory
later
in
his
talk
he
said
he
committed
sin
more
or
less
every
day
the
word
of
god
did
not
keep
him
from
sinning
for
he
had
it
in
his
head
instead
of
in
his
heart
to
live
a
bible
life
is
the
only
true
and
right
way
to
live
and
in
order
to
live
such
a
life
we
need
to
have
the
word
written
in
the
heart
i
will
put
my
laws
into
their
mind
and
write
them
in
their
hearts
heb
let
us
illustrate
this
by
taking
a
single
text
having
food
and
raiment
let
us
be
therewith
content
when
we
have
these
words
in
the
heart
they
will
be
true
in
the
life
all
fret
and
worry
and
murmurings
will
be
banished
out
of
the
life
when
the
heart
is
full
of
the
truth
how
to
keep
the
word
of
god
in
the
heart
since
keeping
the
word
of
god
in
the
heart
is
the
only
way
to
successful
christian
living
you
will
at
once
want
to
know
how
to
keep
it
in
the
heart
the
word
is
kept
in
the
heart
the
same
as
food
is
kept
in
the
body
the
food
is
eaten
and
then
by
the
process
of
assimilation
it
becomes
a
part
of
the
body
this
is
something
of
a
mystery
nevertheless
we
all
know
it
to
be
true
we
feel
weak
in
body
but
soon
after
we
partake
of
food
we
feel
stronger
somehow
that
food
gets
into
the
life
and
makes
us
stronger
now
man
shall
not
live
by
bread
alone
but
by
every
word
that
proceedeth
out
of
the
mouth
of
god
we
can
eat
the
word
of
god
and
we
i
must
eat
it
in
order
to
get
it
into
our
heart
and
life
by
eating
and
the
process
of
assimilation
the
word
becomes
a
part
of
our
inner
being
we
eat
it
by
faith
and
the
spirit
assimilates
it
into
our
hearts
let
us
take
a
text
in
honor
preferring
one
another
it
is
blessed
to
have
an
experience
like
this
to
feel
happy
when
others
are
honored
and
we
are
not
is
certainly
a
desirable
experience
we
can
have
it
as
you
read
the
above
text
love
it
admire
it
desire
it
ask
for
it
believe
you
receive
it
and
you
have
it
it
will
be
a
truth
of
beauty
and
of
power
in
your
soul
and
life
but
remember
you
must
have
an
eagerness
for
it
you
must
lay
hold
upon
it
as
the
infant
does
upon
the
mother
breast
the
same
is
true
with
every
text
in
the
bible
eat
the
entire
book
and
thus
you
will
have
it
as
a
glorious
source
of
power
and
purity
in
your
life
man
the
vehicle
for
exhibiting
god
perfections
man
was
created
for
a
purpose
and
that
purpose
was
to
glorify
his
creator
isa
but
man
sinned
and
came
short
of
the
glory
of
god
the
lord
that
he
may
yet
be
glorified
in
the
man
provides
a
way
of
redemption
through
the
redemption
we
have
in
christ
we
can
live
to
the
glory
of
god
this
is
god
purpose
the
whole
of
life
should
be
such
as
will
glorify
the
creator
and
all
that
we
do
should
be
done
with
that
end
in
view
god
help
us
living
for
god
honoring
his
word
magnifying
his
name
this
is
the
duty
of
man
awful
responsibility
oh
what
carefulness
it
should
work
in
us
what
vehement
desire
what
earnest
seeking
after
god
that
we
may
live
such
a
life
jesus
was
here
in
the
world
and
was
the
light
of
the
world
he
had
a
human
body
and
in
that
body
lived
a
life
that
glorified
god
that
was
an
exemplary
life
such
a
life
and
such
a
life
only
is
to
the
glory
of
god
we
must
fashion
our
life
after
his
if
we
would
spend
life
as
we
should
to
know
how
jesus
lived
is
to
know
how
we
should
live
every
life
that
is
in
the
likeness
of
christ
life
is
accepted
of
god
no
other
life
can
be
while
christ
was
here
in
the
body
he
was
in
the
express
image
of
the
father
the
true
holy
character
of
god
was
revealed
through
jesus
human
life
to
a
lost
and
sinning
world
god
had
done
all
he
could
to
reveal
his
true
character
to
man
by
laws
ceremonies
and
ordinances
but
these
were
only
the
shadow
of
the
true
life
that
was
to
be
the
light
of
the
world
christ
was
both
god
and
man
having
a
physical
form
which
is
visible
he
could
set
the
holiness
of
god
in
plain
view
before
the
world
if
you
would
know
the
true
life
look
to
jesus
but
his
life
could
be
perfect
only
as
it
was
given
in
sacrifice
for
man
his
life
was
holy
because
it
was
a
life
sacrificed
to
god
no
life
can
be
possessed
by
god
and
used
to
his
glory
that
is
not
sacrificed
to
him
jesus
gave
himself
as
an
offering
and
sacrifice
to
god
for
us
eph
this
left
him
without
a
body
or
human
life
through
which
to
demonstrate
moral
principle
to
the
world
but
now
comes
the
command
to
man
i
beseech
you
therefore
brethren
by
the
mercies
of
god
that
ye
present
your
bodies
a
living
sacrifice
holy
acceptable
unto
god
which
is
your
reasonable
service
rom
god
would
have
this
human
life
of
ours
offered
up
in
sacrifice
so
that
we
are
no
more
ours
but
his
when
we
do
so
there
will
be
a
change
a
great
and
wonderful
change
that
life
will
no
longer
be
worldly
or
in
the
course
of
ordinary
men
it
will
be
a
transformed
life
a
life
in
which
god
can
live
and
do
his
will
through
the
sacrifice
of
christ
god
will
take
the
sacrificed
life
of
man
and
possess
it
by
his
spirit
and
again
demonstrate
moral
principle
to
the
world
o
man
that
is
your
calling
in
life
you
are
the
vehicle
to
convey
the
perfections
of
god
to
an
unbelieving
world
only
an
empty
vessel
for
god
to
fill
with
himself
and
use
to
his
glory
o
man
consider
thyself
and
know
thyself
the
purpose
for
which
thou
wert
created
and
the
place
which
thou
dost
occupy
in
creation
thou
art
no
mean
creature
thou
art
highest
of
all
god
condescends
to
walk
and
talk
with
thee
he
upholds
thee
in
his
hand
angels
minister
to
thee
when
thou
passest
through
the
waters
god
himself
will
be
with
thee
so
that
they
shall
not
overflow
thee
and
when
thou
walkest
through
the
fire
he
will
walk
with
thee
so
that
the
flame
shall
not
kindle
upon
thee
because
thou
art
precious
in
his
sight
and
honorable
and
he
has
set
his
love
upon
thee
thou
art
so
precious
to
him
that
he
gave
his
only
begotten
son
to
die
to
ransom
thee
in
the
vast
created
universe
what
place
does
man
occupy
he
stands
out
as
a
creature
that
bears
the
stamp
of
the
divine
image
a
creature
that
is
endowed
with
eternity
the
heavens
shall
pass
away
but
man
shall
be
forever
he
was
made
capable
of
holding
communion
with
the
creator
he
occupies
the
relationship
with
god
as
child
with
parent
being
made
in
the
likeness
of
god
he
steps
out
upon
the
stage
of
the
mighty
universe
to
play
the
highest
and
noblest
part
in
the
entire
drama
of
created
existences
the
songs
of
the
morning
stars
as
they
sing
together
pouring
their
anthems
into
the
ears
of
god
are
not
such
sweet
music
as
is
the
voice
of
praise
and
adoration
from
the
holy
soul
of
man
man
was
created
for
the
very
highest
purpose
in
the
mind
of
god
he
is
chosen
to
represent
the
divine
character
on
the
stage
men
and
women
represent
certain
characters
man
upon
the
great
stage
of
life
is
selected
to
represent
the
holy
character
of
god
oh
that
he
might
play
his
part
well
he
who
occupies
the
highest
and
most
responsible
part
in
this
wonderful
play
of
the
universe
will
sink
to
the
lowest
shame
and
disgrace
if
he
fails
the
eyes
of
earth
heaven
and
hell
were
turned
upon
man
as
he
stepped
out
to
play
his
part
a
garden
eastward
in
eden
was
selected
as
the
ground
of
exhibition
it
was
whispered
throughout
the
corridors
of
the
universe
will
he
succeed
will
he
play
his
part
well
ah
the
sad
story
he
failed
and
he
fell
bringing
a
world
into
shame
and
disgrace
causing
angels
to
weep
and
god
to
repent
that
he
had
ever
made
him
but
heaven
love
was
set
upon
him
and
god
sought
a
way
whereby
the
fallen
man
could
be
lifted
from
his
low
degraded
plane
to
the
high
position
he
once
occupied
after
searching
heaven
through
god
found
but
one
way
for
man
redemption
but
one
price
to
pay
would
he
pay
it
he
called
his
son
his
only
son
and
pointed
out
to
him
the
fallen
condition
of
man
and
how
he
was
robbed
of
glory
and
devils
were
rejoicing
the
father
said
to
his
son
only
thy
entering
into
that
lower
world
in
the
likeness
of
sinful
flesh
and
suffering
and
dying
can
redeem
man
the
son
replied
i
will
go
i
will
suffer
i
will
lay
down
my
life
that
man
may
be
restored
to
his
former
position
so
that
he
can
again
take
up
the
part
he
was
to
play
the
price
was
paid
the
plan
of
man
redemption
was
effected
the
divine
image
was
again
stamped
upon
the
man
so
that
in
christ
jesus
he
could
again
come
out
and
in
his
life
play
reveal
the
character
of
god
to
the
world
reader
this
brings
us
down
to
your
day
and
mine
we
have
our
part
to
play
in
life
that
part
is
to
display
the
divine
perfections
through
christ
this
is
possible
oh
what
responsibility
will
we
play
our
part
well
again
the
eyes
of
earth
heaven
and
hell
are
turned
upon
us
the
apostle
says
we
are
made
a
spectacle
unto
the
world
and
to
angels
and
to
men
cor
men
includes
both
good
and
bad
likewise
the
term
angels
includes
both
good
and
bad
angels
so
as
i
have
said
earth
heaven
and
hell
are
spectators
to
live
life
as
it
should
be
lived
is
to
act
out
our
part
upon
the
stage
of
life
in
such
a
way
as
to
honor
god
and
demonstrate
his
character
before
this
mighty
host
of
spectators
such
is
man
through
him
the
righteous
character
of
god
is
made
visible
to
the
world
god
himself
is
invisible
but
since
he
comes
into
our
heart
and
life
and
since
our
life
is
physical
and
visible
his
holiness
becomes
visible
in
our
holy
living
this
is
how
to
live
he
who
lives
on
a
lower
plane
than
perfect
holiness
is
not
living
to
god
requirements
god
did
not
redeem
man
at
such
a
great
price
merely
for
man
sake
he
redeemed
him
for
his
own
glory
redeemed
man
is
god
purchased
possession
that
should
show
forth
the
virtues
of
him
who
hath
called
him
out
of
darkness
into
his
marvelous
light
see
marginal
reading
of
pet
here
again
we
learn
that
the
mission
of
man
is
to
show
forth
in
his
daily
life
the
true
holy
virtues
of
his
maker
and
redeemer
this
should
be
the
first
business
of
our
life
living
solely
purposely
and
earnestly
for
god
we
are
beings
in
whom
god
dwells
and
through
whom
god
is
to
display
his
own
holy
perfections
this
is
wonderful
this
is
weighty
there
is
i
repeat
great
responsibility
on
man
but
unless
he
feels
it
he
will
never
fill
to
the
full
the
measure
of
life
oh
how
delighted
is
the
loving
heart
of
god
to
find
in
this
world
a
being
in
whom
he
can
dwell
and
through
whom
he
can
reveal
his
own
beautiful
life
shall
we
yield
ourselves
to
him
shall
we
invite
him
into
our
hearts
shall
we
consecrate
our
lives
to
him
that
he
may
hide
our
life
in
his
life
yes
dear
lord
we
are
thine
wholly
thine
now
and
forever
take
full
possession
live
in
us
reign
in
our
hearts
use
every
faculty
of
our
beings
to
thy
own
glory
thy
will
be
done
in
us
and
with
us
as
it
is
done
in
heaven
jesus
will
gather
his
holy
angels
before
him
and
address
them
thus
do
you
behold
brother
he
is
a
pilgrim
and
stranger
down
there
in
the
earth
he
is
my
child
i
have
washed
him
in
my
blood
and
clothed
him
with
the
beautiful
garments
of
salvation
his
heart
is
pure
and
full
of
love
he
is
dead
to
sin
and
the
world
he
loves
my
will
and
his
daily
meat
and
drink
is
to
do
it
he
loves
my
word
and
has
hid
it
in
his
heart
he
keeps
all
my
commandments
he
seeks
my
glory
he
often
communes
with
me
he
is
fervent
in
spirit
and
zealous
in
good
works
his
good
deeds
and
prayers
i
bottle
up
here
in
heaven
see
that
beautiful
mansion
yonder
with
its
gates
of
gold
and
walls
of
jasper
its
floors
of
transparent
glass
its
corridors
of
chalcedony
and
colonades
of
topaz
and
beryl
that
mansion
is
to
be
his
home
when
his
pilgrimage
in
that
is
done
by
his
holy
walk
and
devoted
life
he
is
now
confessing
me
before
men
and
i
take
great
delight
in
telling
you
that
he
is
my
child
and
in
confessing
him
before
you
and
my
father
on
his
throne
just
as
i
have
said
in
my
word
he
that
will
confess
me
before
men
him
will
i
confess
before
my
father
and
the
holy
angels
redeemed
man
is
a
light
in
the
world
in
the
darkness
of
this
world
he
is
a
dispeller
of
gloom
his
life
shines
shedding
its
peaceful
rays
of
light
wherever
he
goes
man
life
when
meeting
the
fullest
purpose
of
god
is
used
as
a
through
which
others
may
look
and
see
the
beauties
of
divine
perfections
alas
it
is
to
be
lamented
that
the
life
of
many
who
profess
to
be
followers
of
jesus
is
such
that
it
blurs
the
perfections
of
god
in
concluding
this
chapter
let
me
give
you
a
few
rules
for
daily
living
rules
which
if
followed
will
make
your
life
a
conveyancer
of
light
peace
and
holiness
from
god
to
the
world
live
such
a
life
that
the
pure
and
devoted
will
be
pleased
to
have
you
come
again
live
so
near
to
god
that
every
man
that
meets
you
is
made
a
little
better
by
having
met
you
live
such
a
life
each
day
that
the
world
can
see
in
you
the
true
way
of
life
be
such
a
light
that
others
can
see
the
way
to
walk
some
use
to
jesus
o
christ
the
way
the
truth
the
life
keep
me
safe
mid
the
raging
strife
help
me
a
warrior
brave
to
be
and
take
the
for
thee
i
fear
not
the
swift
arrow
power
since
thou
art
my
high
tower
the
darts
may
have
a
bitter
sting
i
shelter
thy
feathery
wing
before
me
the
goliaths
tall
must
quickly
flee
or
headlong
fall
the
foe
is
bruised
beneath
my
feet
in
thee
the
victory
is
complete
jesus
to
thee
i
give
up
all
to
live
or
die
to
stand
or
fall
the
sparrows
have
thy
kindly
care
i
more
than
they
then
need
i
fear
i
have
a
refuge
from
all
harm
within
thy
strong
encircling
arm
thou
keepest
me
by
day
and
night
and
guidest
my
weak
steps
aright
the
hairs
on
my
unworthy
head
are
numbered
all
thy
book
has
said
gathered
like
the
defenseless
brood
my
soul
is
kept
in
quietude
as
kind
and
loving
parents
would
give
to
their
children
all
things
good
so
from
thy
presence
angels
bring
unto
thy
child
each
needful
thing
sometimes
thou
hidest
thy
sweet
face
the
way
is
dark
i
can
not
trace
thou
doest
best
i
not
repine
but
say
thy
will
be
done
not
mine
since
them
art
good
so
good
to
me
i
beg
to
be
some
use
to
thee
intensify
thy
love
divine
within
my
heart
that
i
may
shine
a
little
brighter
lord
for
thee
that
others
thy
great
love
may
see
oh
crucified
let
all
self
be
that
thou
mayst
shine
thy
light
through
me
i
would
not
be
so
dazzling
bright
that
all
the
world
might
see
my
light
but
in
some
quiet
nook
of
thine
an
place
there
i
shine
is
not
for
me
to
shine
afar
like
blazing
sun
or
brilliant
star
just
help
me
at
my
door
to
be
a
little
for
thee
godly
living
when
some
one
is
spoken
of
as
living
a
worldly
life
it
is
meant
that
he
lives
in
a
worldly
manner
or
in
a
manner
like
the
world
likewise
when
some
one
is
spoken
of
as
living
a
godly
life
it
is
meant
that
he
lives
in
a
godly
manner
or
in
a
manner
like
god
to
many
this
is
a
hard
saying
but
it
is
possible
for
man
to
live
just
such
a
life
in
fact
it
is
the
only
right
way
of
life
a
godly
life
is
the
only
true
life
such
a
life
is
demanded
by
the
scriptures
we
are
to
live
soberly
righteously
and
godly
in
this
present
world
god
dear
children
are
told
to
be
followers
of
him
eph
in
some
translations
this
reads
be
ye
imitators
of
god
and
in
some
others
be
ye
mimickers
of
god
from
this
we
understand
that
to
be
a
follower
of
god
is
to
live
or
act
in
a
manner
like
him
again
it
is
said
of
those
who
abide
in
christ
that
they
should
walk
even
as
he
walked
our
manner
of
life
should
be
as
was
the
life
of
jesus
it
is
said
of
christ
that
when
he
was
reviled
he
reviled
not
again
although
he
was
treated
most
shamefully
by
his
enemies
he
did
not
seek
to
avenge
himself
when
insulting
remarks
were
made
to
him
he
gave
no
reply
to
live
a
godly
life
is
to
live
in
the
same
manner
when
christians
are
reviled
they
bless
when
they
are
persecuted
they
suffer
meekly
and
patiently
when
jesus
was
being
put
to
death
by
his
enemies
he
prayed
the
father
to
forgive
them
when
a
man
who
had
come
to
take
jesus
had
his
ear
cut
off
jesus
in
his
tender
compassion
healed
this
bitter
persecutor
wound
this
is
the
true
spirit
of
godliness
the
full
standard
of
godliness
is
attained
to
only
when
the
whole
tenor
of
the
life
is
in
simplicity
and
godly
sincerity
the
apostle
paul
said
in
testimony
that
his
rejoicing
was
this
the
testimony
of
his
conscience
that
in
simplicity
and
godly
sincerity
not
with
fleshly
wisdom
but
by
the
grace
of
god
he
had
had
his
conduct
in
the
world
a
godly
life
is
wholly
free
from
ostentation
every
act
is
done
in
purest
simplicity
and
truest
sincerity
as
god
scrutinizes
every
act
by
his
eye
he
discovers
no
impure
motive
as
or
lifting
up
of
self
for
all
is
in
godly
sincerity
the
grace
of
godliness
in
the
christian
character
is
capable
of
cultivation
and
increase
there
is
a
law
in
both
the
material
and
spiritual
that
exercise
is
conducive
to
growth
the
apostle
said
exercise
thyself
unto
godliness
in
the
emphatic
this
reads
train
thyself
for
piety
here
is
something
for
every
soul
that
has
any
aspiration
to
be
more
godly
in
life
train
yourself
for
piety
to
become
of
deeper
piety
and
more
godly
is
the
joy
of
the
christian
heart
by
training
we
become
more
pious
the
forms
an
espalier
by
intertwining
the
branches
of
the
vine
he
keeps
intertwining
them
as
they
grow
and
by
such
training
forms
a
latticework
made
of
shrubbery
the
soul
intertwined
with
the
meek
and
lowly
life
of
jesus
will
form
a
character
of
deep
piety
and
sincere
godliness
the
daily
life
should
be
intertwined
with
the
life
of
jesus
let
there
be
no
reaching
out
for
anything
outside
of
him
for
a
proper
development
of
the
christian
graces
there
must
be
a
constant
training
or
intertwining
of
the
soul
with
god
this
linking
more
tightly
is
the
result
of
growth
and
growth
is
produced
by
exercise
and
exercise
consists
in
reading
the
scriptures
in
prayer
and
in
deep
thought
or
with
god
the
athlete
takes
such
exercises
and
eats
such
foods
as
will
most
properly
develop
and
strengthen
his
muscles
the
soul
that
has
any
longings
for
more
of
god
must
exercise
to
have
its
yearnings
gratified
to
be
conscious
of
a
growing
up
into
christ
to
feel
the
soul
intertwining
more
and
more
with
the
life
of
god
is
fulness
of
joy
and
perfect
happiness

all
the
duties
that
belong
to
a
godly
life
some
give
great
diligence
for
a
time
and
make
spiritual
gain
and
then
lose
it
all
in
a
day
of
slackness
but
do
not
slack

constant

persevering
be
encouraged

to
do
there
is
so
much
to
do
that
every
one
is
needed
to
help
in
doing
it
in
this
great
busy
world
of
life
there
is
something
for
every
one
to
do
the
command
is
whatsoever
thy
hand
findeth
to
do
do
it
with
thy
might
think
over
these
words
for
a
moment
does
not
your
heart
feel
that
they
imply
great
earnestness
in
life
they
mean
a
life
of
labor
a
life
of
service
do
with
your
might
implies
putting
your
whole
heart
into
your
work
do
it
in
just
such
a
manner
as
shows
you
expect
to
make
a
success
of
it
god
has
a
work
for
every
one
that
comes
into
the
world
this
world
is
going
to
be
made
a
little
better
by
your
having
come
into
it
or
it
will
be
made
worse
which
shall
it
be
no
one
can
do
the
work
of
another
since
every
one
is
given
all
he
can
do
it
is
true
we
are
told
to
bear
one
another
burdens
i
am
to
help
you
bear
your
burdens
that
is
a
part
of
my
work
you
are
to
help
me
we
need
the
help
of
each
other
but
i
can
not
do
what
you
ought
to
do
for
i
have
all
i
can
do
what
you
neglect
to
do
will
have
to
go
undone
if
some
one
stops
to
do
what
you
ought
to
do
just
as
large
a
rent
is
made
in
his
life
work
as
would
have
been
made
in
yours
but
the
reflection
is
on
you
a
father
who
had
five
sons
left
them
a
certain
work
to
do
he
gave
to
each
his
portion
according
to
his
ability
upon
his
return
he
found
that
four
of
them
had
done
their
part
and
done
it
well
but
one
had
only
partially
done
his
consequently
there
was
a
neglected
spot
a
dropped
stitch
which
constantly
showed
itself
if
we
fail
to
do
the
work
in
life
that
god
in
his
wisdom
has
assigned
us
there
will
be
in
the
father
great
plan
a
blank
space
a
neglected
part
that
will
show
through
all
eternity
is
your
life
or
mine
going
to
be
the
dropped
stitch
in
the
great
web
of
human
life
down
in
our
heart
there
is
a
no
for
an
answer
is
there
not
let
not
the
precious
moments
of
your
life
flee
away
unimproved
jesus
is
our
example
he
went
about
doing
good
everywhere
he
went
he
left
evidences
that
he
had
passed
along
that
way
o
pilgrim
on
life
journey
what
are
you
leaving
along
the
way
to
show
in
that
you
have
passed
along
is
it
flowers
you
are
strewing
is
it
sunshine
to
cheer
and
lighten
the
hearts
of
others
sad
indeed
if
there
is
none
to
say
he
did
me
good
it
matters
not
how
small
may
be
the
part
of
his
great
work
the
father
has
assigned
you
do
that
little
and
do
it
well
and
do
it
with
all
the
earnestness
of
your
heart
it
is
your
part
and
you
should
do
it
with
as
much
earnestness
and
interest
as
those
who
are
engaged
in
the
greater
works
do
their
parts
if
your
part
is
not
done
well
there
will
not
be
completeness
in
the
divine
plan
a
single
stitch
dropped
shows
a
blemish
in
the
garment
in
the
sight
of
god
the
most
menial
task
is
as
sacred
as
that
of
the
highest
order
and
when
well
done
as
greatly
meets
his
approval
that
is
a
beautiful
thought
expressed
by
the
mohammed
bible
it
tells
of
gabriel
being
sent
to
earth
to
do
two
things
one
was
to
keep
king
solomon
from
becoming
so
much
engaged
with
the
affairs
of
his
kingdom
as
to
neglect
the
hour
of
prayer
the
other
was
to
give
assistance
to
a
little
ant
that
was
trying
to
bear
its
load
of
food
up
a
hillside
to
gabriel
the
one
duty
was
as
important
as
the
other
because
both
came
in
the
plan
of
god
whatsoever
thy
hand
findeth
to
do
do
it
with
thy
might
think
these
words
over
again
let
them
have
the
full
force
of
meaning
to
your
heart
take
as
much
interest
in
helping
the
little
child
get
the
tangle
out
of
the
string
as
in
building
a
church
edifice
many
are
working
but
alas
how
few
are
doing
their
best
so
much
time
and
labor
are
being
wasted
so
many
things
are
being
done
that
had
as
well
not
be
done
god
wants
not
only
our
service
but
our
best
service
we
are
under
obligation
to
do
our
best
every
day
if
we
let
a
day
pass
by
without
doing
what
we
could
and
in
the
best
way
we
could
our
work
is
not
perfectly
done
god
pours
his
blessings
out
upon
us
but
the
blessing
is
not
to
end
with
itself
remember
these
words
freely
ye
have
received
freely
give
seek
to
be
blessed
of
god
that
you
may
pass
the
blessing
on
to
others
leave
some
footprints
here
upon
the
sands
of
time
so
that
in
they
may
guide
some
one
to
a
noble
deed
and
better
way
when
you
reach
the
end
of
life
you
can
experience
no
greater
consolation
than
to
know
you
have
done
what
you
could
improve
the
moments
of
time
while
you
have
them
they
are
passing
swiftly
they
will
not
wait
for
you
some
people
are
going
to
do
but
behold
the
opportunity
passes
before
they
are
ready
opportunities
do
not
wait
do
good
while
you
may
you
are
going
to
give
the
flower
tomorrow
but
tomorrow
the
flower
may
have
faded
you
intended
to
speak
a
kind
word
yesterday
but
thought
you
would
defer
until
another
day
but
the
strain
was
so
great
the
life
went
out
and
your
kind
word
came
too
late
today
is
the
day
to
save
the
lost
tomorrow
may
be
too
late
how
sad
that
a
soul
through
all
eternity
will
be
crying
out
you
were
going
to
help
me
but
you
came
too
late
o
god
help
us
to
be
up
and
doing
while
it
is
called
today
what
work
you
are
going
to
do
do
it
now
as
the
poet
urges
in
the
following
beautiful
lines
let
not
be
living
in
the
past
on
what
we
have
been
doing
nor
building
castles
in
the
air
and
after
them
pursuing
in
my
vineyard
go
today
the
master
time
is
narrow
for
yesterday
we
see
no
more
we
may
not
see
tomorrow
if
for
discouragements
you
look
you
certainly
shall
find
them
but
they
are
not
discouragements
except
to
those
who
mind
them
the
future
for
itself
will
care
we
not
its
trouble
borrow
sufficient
evil
is
today
then
think
not
of
the
morrow
let
cast
our
bread
upon
the
flood
in
many
days
to
gather
but
then
at
eve
hold
out
the
hand
for
present
blessings
rather
we
hide
the
seed
deep
in
the
ground
and
watch
the
closing
furrow
when
lo
the
field
already
white
not
waiting
for
the
morrow
the
sower
and
the
reaper
both
may
now
rejoice
together
for
what
they
sow
and
gather
in
is
fruit
that
lives
forever
the
saint
rejoices
evermore
in
the
midst
of
sorrow
he
knows
the
weeping
but
a
night
joy
cometh
on
the
morrow
man
was
made
to
labor
he
is
so
constituted
that
he
can
not
find
true
rest
and
enjoyment
in
idleness
how
much
the
bible
says
about
good
works
we
are
created
in
christ
jesus
unto
good
works
which
god
hath
before
ordained
that
we
should
walk
in
them
jesus
purifies
unto
himself
a
peculiar
people
zealous
of
good
works
we
are
told
by
the
scriptures
to
be
careful
to
maintain
good
works
to
be
not
weary
in
and
to
do
good
unto
all
men
time
is
given
us
to
spend
in
usefulness
not
in
idleness
money
lost
may
be
regained
but
a
moment
never
as
christians
we
have
the
mind
of
jesus
with
such
a
mind
we
can
not
be
contented
unless
we
are
doing
the
will
of
god
and
making
the
proper
use
of
the
moments
he
gives
us
mind
is
the
same
quality
whether
it
be
in
jesus
in
angels
or
in
men
and
it
is
governed
by
the
same
laws
it
is
true
that
after
man
transgression
he
was
told
that
in
the
sweat
of
his
face
he
should
eat
bread
but
this
does
not
imply
that
the
disposition
to
labor
is
a
result
of
the
fall
the
disposition
to
labor
that
we
find
in
constitution
is
not
the
fruit
of
corruption
in
his
nature
but
is
a
part
of
his
original
constitution
we
find
this
disposition
in
the
mind
of
angels
they
are
ministering
spirits
they
are
doing
the
will
of
god
how
often
we
read
in
the
book
that
tells
of
heaven
how
angels
have
visited
this
transitory
world
of
ours
on
errands
of
help
mercy
and
consolation
they
have
closed
the
mouths
of
lions
opened
prison
doors
stilled
the
waves
whispered
comforting
words
rolled
away
the
stone
and
ministered
strength
and
help
to
the
needy
man
is
not
designed
for
prayer
and
praise
only
he
is
designed
for
service
as
well
his
mission
is
twofold
he
is
to
adore
and
praise
his
creator
and
to
serve
his
fellow
men
some
have
symbolized
the
two
functions
of
life
by
the
ascending
and
descending
of
the
angels
on
the
ladder
that
jacob
saw
in
his
dream
they
ascended
to
god
and
descended
to
man
life
should
be
spent
in
praising
god
and
in
serving
man
for
god
sake
there
is
something
to
do
there
is
much
to
do
there
is
too
much
to
do
for
us
to
idle
away
one
moment
of
time
a
full
and
life
is
one
which
is
spent
in
doing
good
out
of
pure
love
to
god
and
man
when
we
shall
have
come
down
to
the
end
of
life
journey
how
sweet
it
will
be
to
know
that
we
have
done
all
we
could
to
help
other
pilgrims
make
their
journey
in
safety
there
is
a
reward
for
every
generous
act
heaven
is
faithful
and
will
repay
what
we
do
here
will
find
an
eternity
of
reward
let
not
therefore
one
day
pass
you
by
without
your
doing
something
purposely
for
god
spiritual
dryness
we
often
meet
with
those
who
complain
of
dryness
and
deadness
in
their
worship
they
are
very
unlike
the
psalmist
picture
of
the
blessed
man
he
shall
be
like
a
tree
planted
by
the
rivers
of
water
that
bringeth
forth
his
fruit
in
his
season
his
leaf
also
shall
not
wither
this
is
a
true
picture
of
the
christian
life
the
soul
should
be
as
a
watered
garden
fresh
and
green
and
sparkling
it
should
be
a
springtime
you
have
seen
a
garden
in
the
spring
or
one
that
is
all
is
beauty
freshness
and
vigor
such
a
garden
is
used
by
the
prophet
to
symbolize
the
soul
he
says
and
the
lord
shall
guide
thee
continually
and
satisfy
thy
soul
in
drought
and
make
fat
thy
bones
and
thou
shalt
be
like
a
watered
garden
and
like
a
spring
of
water
whose
waters
fail
not
isa
in
order
to
have
such
a
happy
experience
however
the
children
of
god
must
meet
certain
conditions
the
context
says
if
thou
draw
out
thy
soul
to
the
hungry
and
satisfy
the
afflicted
soul
if
our
souls
are
not
drawn
out
in
pity
for
the
hungry
and
we
fail
to
do
what
we
can
to
relieve
them
we
need
not
expect
anything
other
than
a
spiritual
drought
in
our
own
cases
spiritual
dryness
is
sometimes
the
result
of
attachment
to
the
world
set
your
affections
on
things
above
and
not
on
things
on
the
earth
unless
we
live
by
the
bible
we
can
not
be
spiritual
a
little
affection
for
the
things
of
earth
robs
the
soul
of
spiritual
life
in
this
matter
satan
is
an
excellent
reasoner
he
will
suggest
that
your
desires
are
only
for
the
glory
of
god
that
you
have
no
affection
for
the
worldly
object
but
desire
it
only
for
god
glory
a
young
lady
to
whom
i
gave
warning
said
that
her
desires
were
pure
and
that
she
had
no
affection
for
the
object
but
sought
only
to
please
the
lord
very
soon
however
she
came
to
the
realization
that
her
soul
was
a
desert
place
and
all
because
she
had
believed
the
falsehood
of
satan
beware
how
you
desire
earthly
things
for
god
glory
underneath
may
be
a
desire
for
ease
or
luxury
if
you
are
troubled
by
a
lack
of
sensible
devotion
in
worship
examine
your
affections
possibly
you
may
find
some
tiny
roots
twining
around
something
of
this
world
spiritual
dryness
may
be
the
result
of
sloth
slothfulness
casteth
into
a
deep
sleep
prov
spiritual
idleness
soon
results
in
spiritual
dryness
that
sophism
of
satan
no
time
for
prayer
is
very
dangerous
any
neglect
of
spiritual
devotion
must
result
in
lukewarmness
oh
how
unreasonable
is
man
and
how
easily
the
desires
of
the
flesh
deceive
if
you
neglected
to
water
your
garden
you
would
not
wonder
for
a
moment
why
it
was
drying
up
then
when
you
are
neglecting
to
water
the
soul
in
vigorous
spiritual
exercises
why
do
you
wonder
at
your
being
so
spiritually
dull
awake
thou
that
sleepest
up
and
away
to
the
hill
of
the
lord
be
the
frequent
witness
of
a
sunrise
scene
from
the
mount
of
prayer
the
san
jose
scale
works
imperceptibly
at
first
oftentimes
its
presence
will
be
detected
only
by
the
experienced
its
presence
will
perhaps
be
known
first
by
the
fruit
if
your
spiritual
fruit
is
not
as
beautiful
and
fully
developed
as
it
should
be
look
for
the
presence
of
sloth
in
the
soul
the
poison
of
sloth
will
get
into
the
soul
little
by
little
first
there
will
be
a
momentary
delay
of
spiritual
duties
satan
is
too
wise
to
suggest
an
entire
abandonment
of
them
but
he
will
suggest
a
little
postponement
one
delay
will
soon
be
followed
by
another
and
then
by
another
these
delays
are
an
opiate
that
dulls
the
spiritual
senses
and
thus
they
will
yield
more
readily
to
postponements
and
finally
find
pleasure
in
them
let
me
make
this
still
more
simple
for
some
may
need
it
made
very
easy
to
understand
when
the
soul
is
like
a
watered
garden
it
will
be
drawn
to
god
in
prayer
in
the
early
morning
any
delay
will
cause
uneasiness
and
restlessness
the
soul
longs
to
hasten
away
to
the
presence
of
god
but
one
little
delay
after
another
brings
on
a
morbid
condition
the
soul
loses
its
keen
relish
its
senses
become
deadened
so
that
there
is
no
uneasiness
while
the
senses
of
the
will
find
pleasure
in
sloth
when
the
soul
once
gets
into
the
habit
of
idleness
it
experiences
no
little
difficulty
in
getting
out
on
becoming
aware
of
his
state
the
individual
may
acknowledge
his
inactivity
and
make
resolves
to
be
more
earnest
and
diligent
only
very
soon
to
relapse
into
the
same
former
sluggishness
this
virus
of
sloth
inoculates
the
entire
spiritual
being
poisoning
the
will
and
making
spiritual
activity
most
disagreeable
not
only
does
it
destroy
the
will
of
the
soul
but
it
blindfolds
the
eyes
so
that
the
individual
can
see
no
necessity
for
great
fervency
in
spirit
or
for
diligence
in
spiritual
exercise
in
a
manner
he
acknowledges
that
the
watchings
often
and
fastings
often
and
praying
always
of
the
apostle
paul
were
very
consistent
in
him
but
does
not
realize
that
such
would
be
as
desirable
in
his
own
christian
profession
he
wonders
why
he
is
not
healed
as
people
were
in
the
days
of
paul
why
wonder
he
does
not
wonder
why
the
flowers
wither
when
it
does
not
rain
it
is
the
fervent
earnest
prayer
that
god
hears
nothing
but
the
greatest
diligence
and
determination
and
strong
laying
hold
upon
god
will
ever
put
spiritual
sloth
to
death
in
this
respect
it
is
like
the
south
american
animal
called
the
sloth
though
one
species
of
the
sloth
is
only
the
size
of
a
cat
and
is
extremely
slow
on
the
ground
its
highest
rate
of
speed
there
being
not
more
than
ten
feet
an
hour
yet
it
is
difficult
to
exterminate
one
reason
why
so
many
are
slothful
is
that
they
do
not
realize
the
true
worth
of
prayer
oh
i
would
to
god
that
men
rightly
valued
communion
with
god
or
a
few
thoughts
of
him
the
lifting
of
the
heart
to
god
in
praise
or
adoration
is
of
greater
value
than
the
wealth
of
worlds
it
is
not
enough
to
know
much
about
the
doctrine
of
the
bible
to
be
acquainted
with
this
present
reform
and
to
live
a
fair
outward
life
we
must
be
filled
with
the
spirit
we
must
be
like
a
tree
planted
by
the
rivers
of
water
whose
leaf
does
not
wither
take
plenty
of
time
to
gain
heaven
take
time
to
be
spiritual
a
home
in
heaven
is
worth
laboring
for
work
out
your
salvation
with
fear
and
trembling
spiritual
dryness
is
the
result
of
spiritual
indolence
be
active
and
you
will
not
be
unfruitful
prayer
a
work
of
this
nature
would
be
inexcusable
for
not
saying
something
about
prayer
for
who
can
live
life
triumphantly
without
prayer
who
can
properly
estimate
the
true
worth
of
prayer
or
rightly
appreciate
the
privilege
of
prayer
man
esteems
it
a
great
honor
to
be
admitted
into
the
courts
of
the
lords
and
kings
of
earth
what
an
honor
it
is
to
have
audience
with
the
king
of
glory
he
extends
the
golden
scepter
to
us
and
we
come
hopefully
confidingly
into
his
presence
to
tell
him
all
that
is
in
our
hearts
he
loves
us
so
we
should
not
dare
to
come
into
the
awful
presence
of
the
great
king
did
we
not
know
that
he
loves
us
with
an
everlasting
love
when
we
understand
his
love
toward
us
we
tell
him
with
joy
and
eagerness
every
desire
of
the
heart
prayer
is
the
energy
and
life
of
the
soul
it
is
the
invincible
armor
which
shields
the
devoted
christian
from
the
poisoned
missiles
shot
forth
from
the
batteries
of
hell
it
is
the
mighty
weapon
with
which
he
fights
life
battles
unto
victory
he
who
lives
in
prayer
reigns
triumphant
the
dark
are
driven
away
mountains
of
discouragement
are
cast
into
the
sea
chasms
of
difficulties
are
bridged
hope
is
given
wings
faith
increases
and
joys
abound
hell
may
rage
and
threaten
but
he
who
is
frequent
and
fervent
in
prayer
experiences
no
alarm
by
prayer
the
windows
of
heaven
are
opened
and
showers
of
refreshing
dew
are
rained
upon
the
soul
it
is
as
a
watered
garden
a
fertile
spot
where
blooms
the
unfading
rose
of
sharon
and
the
where
spread
the
undecaying
unwithering
branches
of
the
tree
of
life
by
prayer
the
soul
is
nourished
and
strengthened
by
the
divine
life
do
you
long
for
a
brighter
hope
and
deeper
joy
for
a
deeper
sense
of
the
divine
fulness
for
a
sweeter
closer
walk
with
god
then
live
in
prayer
do
you
love
to
feel
the
holy
flame
of
love
burning
in
all
its
intensity
in
your
soul
then
enkindle
it
often
at
the
golden
altar
of
prayer
without
prayer
the
soul
will
weaken
famish
and
die
the
fountain
of
love
dry
up
and
become
as
a
thirsty
and
parched
desert
do
you
admire
the
character
jesus
behold
his
lowliness
and
humility
his
gentleness
and
tender
compassion
have
they
any
beauty
and
do
you
desire
them
to
grace
your
soul
then
draw
them
down
from
the
skies
in
all
their
glorious
fulness
by
the
fervent
prayer
of
faith
as
through
the
process
of
assimilation
food
is
transformed
into
an
active
living
being
so
through
the
medium
of
prayer
the
character
jesus
in
all
its
transcendent
beauty
and
glory
becomes
the
character
of
man
if
you
desire
victory
during
the
day
begin
it
with
prayer
not
a
few
hurried
words
not
a
few
ejaculations
but
minutes
of
deep
intimate
communion
with
god
linger
at
the
altar
of
prayer
until
you
feel
particles
of
glory
drop
in
richness
into
your
soul
scattering
sweetness
throughout
in
the
early
morning
hours
when
the
still
balmy
breath
of
nature
plays
around
you
let
your
soul
fly
away
on
the
wings
of
prayer
with
its
message
of
love
and
praise
to
its
maker
sweet
morning
is
the
time
to
pray
how
lovely
and
how
sweet
to
send
our
early
thoughts
away
up
to
the
if
you
desire
to
be
more
deeply
and
sincerely
pious
pray
if
you
desire
heights
in
his
love
depths
in
his
grace
fulness
in
his
joy
and
richness
in
his
glory
pray
pray
with
all
sincerity
of
heart
and
intensity
of
soul
did
you
say
you
had
no
time
for
prayer
what
a
pity
your
happiness
and
success
in
life
depend
upon
prayer
your
eternal
enjoyment
depends
upon
it
then
oh
what
a
pity
that
you
have
no
time
for
prayer
satan
will
tell
you
there
is
no
need
of
so
much
praying
he
will
give
you
indifferent
feelings
if
he
can
and
tell
you
that
you
can
get
along
well
enough
without
it
he
will
do
all
he
possibly
can
to
prevent
your
praying
if
there
is
not
much
benefit
derived
from
prayer
why
is
he
so
concerned
the
bible
commands
are
watch
and
pray
pray
always
be
instant
in
prayer
pray
without
ceasing
etc
beloved
saints
i
exhort
you
to
a
life
of
prayer
i
beseech
you
in
jesus
name
to
go
often
into
your
closets
and
there
in
all
earnestness
of
soul
pray
until
the
love
of
god
and
light
of
heaven
fill
your
beings
pray
until
a
rapture
from
the
skies
sweeps
over
your
soul
making
the
place
of
prayer
the
dearest
spot
on
earth
to
you
keep
the
roots
watered
how
often
you
admire
a
tree
for
the
loveliness
of
its
green
foliage
and
the
profusion
of
its
luscious
fruit
you
speak
to
your
friend
of
the
beauty
of
the
tree
and
of
the
goodness
of
god
in
bestowing
such
a
gift
to
men
but
perhaps
you
do
not
speak
nor
even
think
of
the
coarse
unsightly
roots
hidden
deep
in
the
ground
but
that
tree
owes
its
beauty
and
its
life
to
roots
the
foliage
is
bright
and
fresh
and
green
because
the
roots
are
burrowing
deep
in
a
rich
and
soil
the
flavoring
of
the
fruit
is
generated
by
the
roots
down
in
the
dark
and
silent
chamber
of
the
earth
perhaps
there
comes
to
your
mind
now
some
whose
faces
you
always
see
lit
up
with
a
radiant
glory
you
can
not
fail
to
admire
them
their
words
contain
a
secret
power
and
seem
to
awaken
in
you
all
that
is
noble
they
seem
to
lift
you
into
a
higher
life
from
their
words
their
actions
and
their
countenances
flows
an
influence
that
causes
you
to
forget
the
things
of
earth
and
makes
you
feel
as
if
you
had
joined
the
society
of
angels
such
ones
have
a
secret
hidden
that
generates
this
peculiar
charm
in
their
visible
life
down
in
a
closet
is
a
secret
laboratory
where
the
fragrance
and
beauty
and
glory
that
flow
out
of
their
lives
are
compounded
there
the
roots
of
their
inner
life
take
hold
upon
the
riches
of
heaven
grace
and
drink
in
of
the
waters
that
flow
in
their
oft
and
silent
communion
with
god
they
take
root
downward
and
then
they
go
forth
into
life
and
bear
fruit
upward
while
others
are
talking
with
their
friends
about
the
things
of
earth
they
meet
with
god
in
the
garden
of
graces
where
the
sweet
spices
flow
out
and
the
frankincense
and
myrrh
scent
the
air
and
there
they
become
laden
with
a
profusion
of
fruits
and
impregnated
with
a
sweet
odor
which
they
bear
out
into
the
world
they
are
like
the
tree
planted
by
the
rivers
of
water
whose
leaf
does
not
wither
o
beloved
pilgrim
see
that
the
roots
of
your
inner
being
are
well
watered
let
them
drink
in
the
sparkling
waters
of
life
remember
effectual
work
for
god
consists
more
in
being
than
in
doing
do
not
go
about
in
your
labor
with
an
empty
basket
it
is
only
when
you
go
out
from
deep
and
silent
communion
with
god
that
your
labor
will
be
effectual
never
think
that
you
have
so
much
to
do
that
you
have
not
much
time
for
prayer
an
hour
work
done
in
the
quiet
secret
power
of
the
spirit
is
worth
more
than
a
day
of
your
own
efforts
keep
the
roots
watered
under
the
in
the
beginning
of
his
ministry
christ
called
to
philip
to
follow
him
upon
being
called
philip
went
in
search
of
nathanael
to
tell
him
that
he
philip
had
found
the
christ
nathanael
was
somewhat
doubtful
but
at
philip
invitation
he
went
to
see
when
jesus
saw
nathanael
coming
he
said
behold
an
israelite
indeed
in
whom
is
no
guile
nathanael
wondering
how
this
man
happened
to
know
him
asked
whence
knowest
thou
me
jesus
answered
when
thou
wast
under
the
i
saw
thee
john
it
is
evident
that
something
had
occurred
with
nathanael
under
the
fig
outside
the
common
details
of
life
if
there
had
not
something
rather
unusual
or
something
higher
than
the
common
events
of
life
occurred
there
the
savior
would
not
have
mentioned
this
one
particular
place
any
other
place
would
have
done
as
well
there
was
in
this
answer
something
that
was
highly
significant
to
nathanael
at
this
time
there
were
many
devout
people
looking
for
the
consolation
of
israel
they
were
looking
for
the
coming
of
the
king
of
the
jews
it
is
not
difficult
for
me
to
believe
that
nathanael
was
under
the
praying
to
god
for
the
speedy
coming
of
the
messiah
when
jesus
said
to
him
when
thou
wast
under
the
i
saw
thee
nathanael
immediately
replied
thou
art
the
king
of
israel
he
was
doubtless
under
the
tree
in
prayer
to
this
end
not
once
only
but
very
probably
for
months
and
maybe
for
years
he
had
been
praying
for
this
very
thing
he
had
selected
one
especial
as
a
place
for
prayer
it
was
not
i
a
but
i
the
there
he
had
prayed
long
and
often
for
israel
king
to
come
so
when
jesus
said
when
thou
wast
under
the
fig
i
saw
thee
he
knew
at
once
that
his
prayers
were
answered
and
therefore
said
rabbi
thou
art
the
son
of
god
thou
art
the
king
of
israel
many
a
devout
one
since
that
day
has
had
his
secret
with
god
perhaps
it
was
in
the
woods
on
a
mossy
knoll
under
an
oak
on
a
grassy
spot
on
the
bank
of
a
stream
or
under
a
that
grew
by
the
brook
in
the
meadow
to
these
places
of
solemn
silence
they
would
retreat
when
the
shades
of
night
were
falling
or
when
the
light
of
the
morning
was
streaking
the
sky
and
there
from
the
fulness
of
their
souls
they
would
pour
out
their
praise
and
thanksgiving
to
god
these
were
the
dearest
places
in
the
world
to
them
it
may
be
there
are
aged
ones
today
who
had
such
places
in
the
earlier
days
of
their
lives
though
they
are
now
far
removed
from
those
scenes
these
are
still
sacred
in
their
memory
there
are
those
today
who
have
their
altars
of
prayer
in
some
secluded
place
there
they
meet
god
and
tell
him
all
their
sorrows
and
cares
there
they
recount
to
him
his
loving
kindness
there
they
implore
his
grace
to
sustain
them
through
all
their
trying
scenes
of
life
and
there
they
worship
at
his
feet
bless
his
name
beloved
have
you
a
and
are
you
often
found
under
it
have
you
a
quiet
nook
somewhere
which
is
hallowed
by
the
presence
of
god
the
beloved
disciple
john
when
in
the
spirit
saw
golden
vials
in
the
hands
of
the
worshipers
of
the
lamb
around
the
throne
these
golden
vials
he
says
were
full
of
odors
which
are
the
prayers
of
the
saints
rev
are
you
dear
reader
every
day
filling
golden
vials
around
throne
with
the
sweet
odor
of
prayer
again
this
disciple
when
the
seventh
seal
was
opened
saw
seven
angels
standing
before
god
with
seven
trumpets
then
came
another
angel
with
a
golden
censer
to
him
was
given
incense
which
he
offered
with
the
prayers
of
saints
upon
the
golden
altar
and
the
smoke
of
the
incense
which
came
with
the
prayers
of
saints
ascended
before
god
see
rev
we
have
the
privilege
of
mingling
our
prayers
with
the
incense
that
is
being
offered
before
the
throne
the
psalmist
seemed
to
comprehend
something
of
the
nature
of
prayer
when
he
said
let
my
prayer
be
set
forth
before
thee
as
incense
and
the
lifting
up
of
my
hands
as
the
evening
sacrifice
psa
the
prayers
that
were
offered
by
the
devout
cornelius
were
so
fragrant
before
god
that
they
were
kept
as
a
memorial
of
him
a
memorial
is
something
kept
in
remembrance
of
any
one
if
you
want
to
be
kept
in
remembrance
before
god
see
that
your
prayers
are
highly
impregnated
with
a
sweet
odor
you
must
pray
or
die
no
one
can
retain
spiritual
life
any
great
length
of
time
without
prayer
so
we
exhort
you
to
a
life
of
prayer
shut
the
door
it
is
as
impossible
to
live
and
prosper
spiritually
without
prayer
as
it
is
to
live
and
prosper
physically
without
food
those
who
enjoy
a
close
walk
with
god
and
have
power
with
him
are
those
who
pray
natural
abilities
and
intellectuality
can
never
supply
any
lack
in
spirituality
unless
you
are
spiritual
you
are
of
but
little
use
to
god
and
to
be
spiritual
you
must
live
much
in
prayer
it
is
not
those
who
are
on
their
knees
the
oftenest
or
the
longest
that
do
the
most
praying
some
may
pray
more
real
prayer
in
one
hour
than
others
in
two
or
three
hours
too
many
people
leave
the
door
open
prayer
that
feeds
the
soul
must
be
offered
with
the
door
shut
but
thou
when
thou
prayest
enter
into
thy
closet
and
when
thou
hast
shut
thy
door
pray
to
thy
father
which
is
in
secret
matt
god
is
in
secret
he
is
hidden
from
the
world
the
world
does
not
see
him
neither
knows
him
you
can
never
reach
god
in
your
prayers
unless
you
shut
out
the
world
shutting
the
door
means
something
more
than
closing
the
door
of
your
literal
closet
persons
may
enter
the
literal
closet
and
close
the
door
and
yet
have
the
world
in
their
hearts
and
thoughts
such
have
not
closed
the
door
in
the
true
sense
in
the
public
assembly
you
must
enter
your
closet
when
you
pray
and
shut
the
door
or
your
prayers
avail
not
with
god
you
must
talk
from
your
heart
to
the
heart
of
god
those
assembled
may
hear
your
words
but
they
do
not
know
the
secret
the
secret
is
between
your
heart
and
the
heart
of
god
you
scarcely
hear
your
words
you
know
and
hear
more
of
the
speaking
of
your
heart
there
is
a
blessing
in
such
praying
there
is
a
joy
that
can
not
be
told
such
prayer
feeds
the
soul
upon
the
divine
life
and
lifts
us
in
realms
of
light
and
happiness
thank
god
for
the
sweet
privilege
of
secret
intercourse
with
him
o
beloved
when
you
pray
enter
into
your
closet
and
be
sure
to
close
the
door
alone
with
god
this
life
of
ours
will
never
be
all
that
it
should
be
unless
we
are
much
alone
with
god
only
those
who
are
oft
alone
with
him
know
the
benefit
that
is
derived
therefrom
you
can
not
be
like
god
unless
you
are
much
with
him
and
you
can
not
live
like
him
unless
you
are
like
him
the
scriptures
tell
us
that
jesus
departed
into
the
mountain
to
be
alone
with
the
father
and
that
he
was
often
alone
praying
when
jesus
had
anything
of
great
importance
to
say
to
his
disciples
he
always
took
them
aside
from
the
multitude
when
he
was
transfigured
he
took
three
of
his
disciples
into
a
mountain
apart
from
all
the
world
when
he
was
one
time
alone
praying
with
his
disciples
he
asked
them
who
he
was
peter
answered
the
christ
of
god
luke
it
was
only
when
he
was
alone
with
them
and
after
prayer
that
he
could
bring
them
into
such
nearness
to
him
that
they
might
know
in
their
hearts
that
he
was
the
son
of
god
when
amid
the
active
duties
of
life
and
when
in
contact
with
the
world
we
can
scarcely
come
into
that
sacred
nearness
to
god
that
will
enable
us
to
feel
in
our
hearts
all
that
god
is
we
may
get
slight
glimpses
of
his
glory
we
may
occasionally
get
a
dim
view
of
some
of
his
beauty
we
may
feel
a
little
warming
of
his
love
in
our
bosoms
but
only
when
alone
with
him
are
we
awed
into
wonder
at
the
sight
of
his
glory
and
great
beauty
it
is
only
then
that
we
see
him
in
his
purity
and
feel
the
warm
sunshine
of
his
love
it
is
only
then
that
our
hearts
can
be
deeply
impressed
with
the
knowledge
that
he
is
god
and
in
childlikeness
we
can
look
up
to
him
and
call
him
father
prayerful
remembrance
at
evening
time
when
shades
draw
nigh
and
flickering
rays
of
light
go
chasing
by
when
all
around
glad
nature
sweetly
sings
and
seems
you
hear
the
sound
of
angel
wings
some
one
in
memory
may
be
brought
to
thee
maybe
some
one
from
distant
land
away
of
whom
you
had
no
thought
for
many
a
day
is
passing
strange
you
do
not
understand
why
such
a
one
and
from
such
distant
land
should
step
across
the
threshold
of
your
mind
why
he
to
you
at
this
time
should
be
brought
is
mystery
when
all
else
claims
your
thought
you
seek
to
understand
but
learn
it
not
maybe
this
one
has
conflict
great
and
sore
is
struggling
long
and
hard
grim
despair
and
god
who
rules
the
thought
and
mind
of
man
has
brought
him
this
long
way
to
you
for
prayer
then
do
not
drive
these
whisperings
from
your
mind
nor
cast
them
carelessly
upon
the
wind
is
but
the
voice
of
god
in
tender
care
for
suffering
one
on
life
broad
way
somewhere
inviting
you
to
plead
for
him
in
prayer
kind
friend
if
at
morning
noon
or
night
i
come
to
thee
on
wings
of
memory
it
is
no
doubt
because
the
fight
is
fierce
then
will
you
bow
and
pray
to
god
for
me
he
careth
for
thee
life
will
never
be
successful
unless
we
learn
to
let
god
care
for
us
unless
we
have
faith
to
know
that
god
is
our
keeper
and
that
hence
we
have
nothing
to
fear
we
shall
never
be
the
cheer
and
sunlight
in
this
dark
world
that
god
designed
us
to
be
this
is
a
world
of
trouble
sin
envelops
many
souls
in
awful
midnight
gloom
some
may
never
find
jesus
unless
they
see
him
smiling
in
your
face
you
as
god
dear
child
are
to
be
a
light
to
those
poor
benighted
souls
to
be
such
a
light
you
must
be
full
of
light
and
to
be
full
of
light
you
must
be
full
of
hope
by
faith
in
the
cheering
and
encouraging
promises
of
god
none
can
be
truly
happy
none
can
be
the
cheer
comfort
and
consolation
to
the
world
who
are
bearing
their
own
burdens
only
those
who
have
learned
the
sweet
lesson
of
trust
in
god
and
know
that
he
cares
for
them
are
truly
happy
and
free
and
capable
of
cheering
others
he
who
this
one
short
life
would
live
as
heaven
has
designed
must
scatter
rays
of
cheering
light
from
a
heart
with
hope
enshrined
there
are
many
priceless
promises
in
the
word
of
god
there
is
a
promise
for
every
need
condition
and
circumstance
of
life
among
these
blessed
promises
here
is
one
that
has
brought
comfort
to
many
a
weary
pilgrim
on
life
way
casting
all
your
care
upon
him
for
he
careth
for
you
pet
if
this
promise
does
not
lift
you
far
above
all
the
trials
discouragements
and
weariness
of
life
it
is
because
you
do
not
believe
it
nor
understand
the
fulness
of
its
meaning
he
careth
for
i
you
it
is
not
your
neighbor
or
your
friend
but
it
is
you
cares
will
come
to
you
certainly
you
could
never
cast
your
cares
upon
god
if
you
had
none
but
you
have
them
and
doubtless
many
of
them
the
difficulty
with
many
is
they
do
not
cast
them
on
god
reader
your
life
will
never
be
it
can
not
be
that
free
happy
radiant
sunlit
helpful
life
that
pleases
god
if
you
bear
your
own
cares
there
is
nothing
too
trivial
in
life
to
take
to
god
in
the
very
smallest
concerns
of
your
daily
life
he
has
an
interest
in
everything
let
your
requests
be
known
unto
him
do
learn
to
take
everything
to
him
fret
over
nothing
never
worry
for
a
moment
let
nothing
disturb
or
disquiet
you
i
say
i
nothing
he
careth
for
you
do
you
comprehend
the
full
meaning
of
these
words
think
them
over
for
a
moment
let
go
of
yourself
and
let
god
keep
you
oh
the
freedom
that
belongs
to
the
children
of
god
theirs
is
a
sweet
land
of
liberty
but
alas
how
many
will
go
on
bearing
their
own
burdens
and
weighted
down
with
care
with
these
words
right
before
them
he
careth
for
you
why
not
let
him
care
is
a
if
you
would
be
strong
in
the
grace
of
god
you
must
live
free
from
care
it
gnaws
at
the
very
vitals
of
the
soul
a
strong
cable
made
of
many
fine
wires
was
stretched
across
the
river
and
was
used
to
tow
a
heavy
scow
back
and
forth
one
of
the
small
strands
was
broken
this
was
thought
to
be
a
small
matter
soon
another
was
broken
and
then
another
still
this
was
not
of
much
consequence
one
by
one
more
were
broken
but
unheeded
because
each
was
so
small
finally
all
were
broken
and
the
boat
went
adrift
a
little
care
does
not
seem
to
be
of
much
consequence
but
the
bible
says
to
be
careful
for
i
nothing
and
to
cast
i
all
your
care
upon
him
some
have
thought
that
the
bearing
of
burdens
and
cares
made
us
strong
in
the
lord
no
it
is
the
casting
of
them
on
jesus
that
makes
us
strong
for
a
man
to
be
down
under
a
heavy
weight
is
no
exercise
to
his
muscles
but
to
be
up
on
his
feet
and
passing
heavy
weights
on
to
another
this
is
exercise
to
be
down
under
burdens
and
cares
is
no
exercise
to
the
soul
but
is
really
death
the
passing
of
the
cares
on
to
jesus
is
the
exercise
and
the
strength
of
the
spiritual
powers
if
you
only
knew
how
much
grace
a
little
care
destroyed
you
would
quickly
cast
them
on
jesus
some
have
come
to
find
themselves
entirely
without
grace
because
they
did
not
cast
their
cares
on
the
lord
we
knew
a
sister
whose
baby
was
such
a
care
that
she
could
not
keep
saved
one
day
when
asked
how
she
was
getting
along
in
the
lord
she
answered
not
well
the
baby
is
such
a
care
and
worry
that
i
can
not
keep
the
victory
i
should
like
to
have
was
it
not
too
bad
to
lay
such
a
blame
upon
a
poor
little
innocent
child
i
was
asked
one
time
if
it
was
possible
to
reach
an
experience
where
we
would
never
fret
or
worry
certainly
we
can
we
shall
never
get
to
a
place
where
we
shall
have
no
temptations
but
we
can
get
to
a
place
where
we
shall
not
yield
to
the
temptations
your
life
has
not
reached
that
degree
of
perfection
that
it
should
until
you
have
attained
to
such
an
experience
jesus
says
take
no
thought
for
the
morrow
when
you
are
having
any
great
anxieties
about
future
things
you
are
doing
what
jesus
tells
you
not
to
do
and
you
can
not
do
something
he
tells
you
not
to
do
without
suffering
spiritual
loss
oh
why
will
you
worry
about
anything
when
jesus
says
be
anxious
for
nothing
but
you
say
when
there
is
no
meat
in
the
larder
and
no
flour
in
the
bin
can
we
then
be
not
anxious
there
are
those
who
have
been
in
just
such
circumstances
and
yet
have
not
been
greatly
troubled
if
you
will
be
about
anything
you
can
never
live
close
to
god
when
anxieties
knock
at
the
door
of
your
heart
for
admittance
and
you
open
the
door
and
let
them
in
you
are
opening
the
door
to
a
dangerous
band
of
robbers
they
are
robbers
of
grace
and
peace
when
anxieties
step
over
the
threshold
of
your
heart
door
grace
and
peace
fly
out
of
the
window
but
what
am
i
to
do
sighs
a
soul
do
just
what
a
good
man
says
he
did
he
said
that
he
opened
his
heart
to
jesus
and
he
came
in
and
shut
the
door
let
jesus
keep
the
door
of
your
heart
when
anxieties
come
and
want
into
your
heart
tell
them
they
must
get
permission
from
jesus
because
you
have
given
your
whole
heart
up
to
him
this
is
what
is
meant
by
casting
your
care
upon
him
it
is
not
enough
to
kneel
down
and
ask
jesus
to
take
them
you
must
cast
them
upon
him
in
this
is
the
needed
exercise
the
soul
that
will
do
this
shall
be
strong
you
must
put
the
burden
over
on
the
lord
shoulders
and
let
him
bear
it
he
will
bear
all
your
burdens
for
you
if
you
will
lay
them
upon
him
not
only
must
you
put
them
upon
him
but
you
must
let
go
entirely
you
do
not
even
need
to
look
after
them
to
see
what
he
does
with
them
your
little
child
comes
to
you
with
a
tangled
cord
it
gives
it
over
into
your
hands
but
holds
to
one
end
now
you
know
that
in
order
to
get
the
tangle
out
you
must
have
both
ends
o
weary
one
jesus
will
disentangle
all
the
cares
of
life
but
you
must
let
him
have
both
ends
he
does
not
want
your
help
you
hinder
him
if
you
attempt
to
help
him
cares
will
come
things
that
are
of
a
trying
nature
will
assail
us
as
long
as
we
live
but
we
have
a
refuge
in
jesus
he
will
bear
our
burdens
he
will
care
for
us
consider
the
lilies
what
a
beautiful
lesson
jesus
has
taught
us
of
rest
and
quietness
from
the
lilies
consider
the
lilies
of
the
field
he
says
how
they
grow
they
toil
not
neither
do
they
spin
he
is
trying
to
teach
us
how
free
we
can
be
free
from
all
earthly
cares
and
anxieties
the
lily
does
not
struggle
it
has
no
anxieties
about
its
future
but
it
grows
it
grows
to
be
beautiful
even
solomon
in
all
his
glory
was
not
arrayed
like
one
of
them
god
paints
the
flower
with
greater
beauty
than
the
robes
of
kings
if
you
would
be
beautiful
you
must
rest
in
the
lord
just
a
little
struggling
and
you
will
mar
the
whole
christ
wants
to
reveal
himself
through
you
he
will
shine
the
beauty
of
his
own
glorious
person
into
your
soul
if
you
will
but
be
quiet
have
no
anxieties
about
the
things
that
pertain
to
this
life
and
jesus
will
clothe
you
with
the
beauties
of
heaven
character
as
the
years
pass
on
is
revealed
on
the
face
the
miser
face
shows
the
miserly
condition
of
his
heart
jesus
will
stamp
his
own
image
upon
the
soul
if
the
soul
is
kept
in
quietness
and
this
image
will
stand
out
in
beauty
on
the
face
and
outward
life
by
this
lesson
of
the
lilies
jesus
did
not
mean
to
teach
that
we
should
not
pray
he
once
said
men
ought
always
to
pray
we
must
pray
much
if
we
do
not
pray
satan
will
have
us
toiling
and
spinning
keeping
close
to
jesus
with
a
strong
faith
and
a
firm
trust
is
the
only
way
to
rest
and
we
can
not
do
this
without
much
prayer
cease
thy
toiling
and
care
learn
a
lesson
from
the
lilies
rest
in
the
lord
and
he
will
make
you
an
object
of
christian
beauty
that
will
bless
the
world
even
after
you
are
long
gone
that
restful
patient
life
will
cast
its
rays
of
light
and
beauty
back
and
chase
away
the
shadows
from
the
life
of
others
the
day
has
gone
the
twilight
fades
there
stillness
everywhere
i
seek
some
place
of
solitude
and
humbly
bow
in
prayer
i
tell
the
story
of
the
day
the
joy
the
grief
the
care
i
keep
not
back
one
secret
thing
but
tell
it
all
in
prayer
o
heart
of
mine
be
light
and
free
not
lightest
burden
bear
in
everything
let
thy
requests
be
told
to
god
in
prayer
yes
all
i
tell
it
all
to
christ
in
evening
twilight
dim
somehow
my
heart
much
lighter
grows
since
all
is
told
to
him
i
lay
my
life
at
his
dear
feet
o
jesus
i
am
thine
i
walk
the
way
of
life
with
thee
thy
will
o
christ
is
mine
and
now
i
lay
me
down
to
sleep
while
gathering
shadows
fall
and
sweet
indeed
my
rest
shall
be
since
jesus
knows
it
all
sorrowful
yet
always
rejoicing
this
world
is
sometimes
called
the
vale
of
tears
jesus
said
in
the
world
ye
shall
have
tribulation
but
he
also
said
in
me
ye
shall
have
peace
the
way
to
heaven
is
through
tribulations
those
whom
john
saw
standing
before
the
throne
and
the
lamb
arrayed
in
white
robes
and
with
palms
in
their
hands
were
one
day
where
we
now
are
and
thank
god
we
coming
up
through
great
tribulation
shall
some
day
be
where
they
are
while
man
in
this
world
will
meet
with
sorrow
he
can
by
the
grace
of
god
always
rejoice
alum
thrown
into
muddy
water
will
clarify
it
the
grace
of
god
thrown
into
a
cup
of
sorrow
will
turn
it
to
joy
sorrows
are
needful
it
is
only
a
barren
waste
where
there
is
no
rainfall
we
have
sung
no
days
are
dark
to
me
this
can
indeed
be
true
but
it
is
not
to
be
taken
in
the
sense
that
there
will
be
no
clouds
nor
rainfall
show
me
a
man
who
never
has
a
cloud
to
float
across
his
sky
and
i
will
show
you
a
man
who
has
not
faith
enough
to
see
clearly
in
the
sunlight
it
is
those
whose
faith
pierces
through
the
cloud
and
keeps
the
smiling
sunlit
face
of
christ
in
view
that
have
the
truest
sweetest
joy
their
rejoicing
is
in
the
lord
by
bravery
and
force
of
will
some
may
shut
themselves
against
sorrow
and
soon
become
insensible
to
it
but
the
heart
that
is
steeled
against
sorrow
is
in
all
probability
so
calloused
that
it
can
not
experience
joy
those
who
know
the
deepest
sorrow
may
ofttimes
know
the
fullest
joy
and
that
in
the
midst
of
their
sorrow
do
not
harden
your
heart
against
sorrow
but
look
to
jesus
for
that
balm
which
heals
that
grace
which
sustains
that
comfort
which
gladdens
some
have
thought
that
true
joy
consists
in
never
having
a
sorrow
that
those
who
have
sorrow
have
not
found
the
way
of
peace
in
this
they
err
those
who
never
have
a
sorrow
rejoice
because
they
have
no
sorrows
but
some
who
have
sorrow
have
learned
to
rejoice
in
the
lord
this
is
truest
joy
sorrowful
said
one
who
was
crucified
with
christ
yet
always
rejoicing
he
never
once
denied
having
sorrow
nay
he
said
i
have
great
heaviness
and
continual
sorrow
in
my
heart
but
he
also
said
i
glory
it
was
the
deep
sorrow
that
made
him
most
like
jesus
he
had
feeling
we
sorrow
he
said
but
not
as
those
who
have
no
hope
the
world
knows
a
sorrow
that
the
christian
does
not
know
christians
should
be
careful
lest
in
hardening
themselves
against
feeling
they
do
not
render
themselves
incapable
of
feeling
compassion
sympathy
and
pity
let
the
tears
flow
if
you
keep
them
back
the
fountain
will
dry
up
may
the
lord
pity
those
who
have
no
tears
jesus
wept
the
apostle
paul
said
out
of
much
affliction
and
anguish
of
heart
i
wrote
unto
you
with
many
tears
oh
that
unfeeling
heart
that
can
not
suffer
that
dry
heart
that
has
no
fountain
of
tears
it
weeps
not
over
the
sorrows
of
others
and
consequently
can
not
rejoice
when
others
are
joyful
only
those
who
weep
can
truly
rejoice
you
rejoice
because
you
and
your
family
are
in
good
health
because
your
friends
are
smiling
upon
you
because
circumstances
surrounding
you
are
favorable
because
you
have
an
abundance
of
good
things
to
eat
and
of
clothing
to
wear
but
your
rejoicing
is
only
in
earthly
things
we
are
to
be
grateful
for
these
things
but
they
are
only
the
of
joy
the
water
lies
beneath
true
joy
is
to
rejoice
not
only
i
in
the
lord
but
i
with
the
lord
rejoice
in
those
things
in
which
jesus
and
the
angels
rejoice
when
your
goods
are
being
wasted
you
find
your
deepest
joy
because
god
is
being
glorified
if
you
can
not
weep
with
angels
you
can
not
rejoice
with
them
see
that
aged
pilgrim
his
has
been
a
hard
and
stony
way
loved
ones
have
gone
one
by
one
from
his
embrace
riches
have
taken
wings
and
flown
away
sorrows
are
multiplied
trials
are
many
burdens
are
heavy
he
is
footsore
sad
and
weary
angels
are
bending
over
him
weeping
can
you
weep
with
him
and
them
they
comfort
him
the
sadness
of
his
heart
begins
to
die
away
hope
begins
to
dawn
the
dawning
of
the
hope
causes
the
angels
to
rejoice
this
is
truest
joy
rejoice
when
souls
are
saved
rejoice
when
hearts
are
gladdened
rejoice
when
god
is
praised
this
is
the
true
source
of
purest
joy
but
it
is
only
those
who
are
capable
of
suffering
deeply
with
the
sufferings
of
others
that
can
truly
rejoice
when
their
sufferings
are
turned
away
the
more
we
are
like
jesus
the
more
we
have
of
his
spirit
the
tenderer
will
be
our
hearts
and
the
more
deeply
will
our
souls
be
moved
by
the
sufferings
of
others
when
some
dear
friend
has
proved
untrue
when
some
loved
one
has
gone
astray
when
the
has
left
a
chair
vacant
at
your
and
deep
sorrow
lies
upon
your
soul
then
it
is
that
you
feel
nearer
to
jesus
you
feel
ripe
for
heaven
the
world
has
suddenly
gone
out
and
you
have
cast
your
eyes
upward
do
not
try
to
keep
back
the
tears
let
them
flow
they
are
pearls
in
angels
sight
it
is
the
tears
of
the
child
that
touches
the
heart
of
the
parent
and
cites
him
to
give
comfort
to
the
little
one
it
is
the
tears
of
the
christian
that
touches
the
great
loving
heart
of
god
and
moves
him
to
give
that
solace
which
only
heaven
gives
david
said
in
a
time
of
deepest
sorrow
his
son
was
seeking
his
life
it
may
be
the
lord
will
look
on
my
tears
margin
and
that
the
lord
will
requite
me
good
hezekiah
was
doomed
to
die
the
prophet
told
him
to
his
house
in
order
for
he
should
die
and
not
live
the
dying
man
turned
his
face
to
the
wall
and
prayed
i
beseech
thee
o
lord
remember
now
how
i
have
walked
before
thee
in
truth
and
with
a
perfect
heart
and
have
done
that
which
is
good
in
thy
sight
and
he
wept
with
a
great
weeping
margin
this
touched
the
heart
of
god
and
he
said
i
have
heard
thy
prayer
i
have
seen
thy
tears
behold
i
will
heal
thee
if
the
heart
of
god
saints
were
a
deeper
fountain
of
tears
more
sick
people
would
be
healed
in
these
days
around
are
the
sick
and
suffering
but
alas
how
few
tears
when
saints
have
so
deepened
into
god
cultivated
such
a
tenderness
of
heart
and
become
so
deeply
compassionate
that
they
will
water
their
couch
with
their
tears
all
the
night
at
the
sight
of
sick
persons
they
will
get
answers
to
their
prayers
to
such
god
will
say
behold
i
will
heal
him
if
tears
will
not
reach
god
the
case
is
hopeless
esau
sought
for
a
place
of
repentance
and
sought
it
with
tears
but
could
not
find
it
the
mentioning
of
tears
here
implies
that
the
addition
of
tears
to
earnest
has
influence
with
god
jeremiah
in
his
lamentations
for
fallen
israel
said
oh
that
my
head
were
waters
and
mine
eyes
a
fountain
of
tears
that
i
might
weep
day
and
night
for
the
slain
of
the
daughter
of
my
people
he
knew
that
if
anything
would
avail
with
god
it
would
be
tears
therefore
he
wished
that
his
eyes
were
a
fountain
of
tears
so
that
god
might
be
moved
to
save
israel
they
that
sow
in
tears
shall
reap
in
joy
there
can
be
no
harvest
from
seed
sown
unless
the
seed
is
watered
as
you
go
out
to
sow
seed
in
the
master
field
water
them
with
your
tears
if
you
would
have
a
joyful
harvest
may
god
save
his
people
from
unfeelingness
of
heart
a
soul
with
no
tears
is
a
soul
with
no
flowers
there
is
no
verdure
where
there
is
no
water
those
who
are
not
deep
enough
in
god
to
shed
tears
over
a
lost
and
ruined
world
are
not
deep
enough
to
shed
tears
of
joy
over
a
salvation
out
from
the
depth
of
his
heart
jesus
cried
o
jerusalem
jerusalem
how
oft
would
i
have
gathered
thee
as
a
hen
gathereth
her
brood
under
her
wing
but
ye
would
not
when
did
you
shed
tears
over
lost
souls
do
you
ever
have
a
gethsemane
is
your
pillow
ever
dampened
by
tears
shed
for
a
doomed
world
do
you
ever
go
out
beneath
the
starry
sky
and
with
outstretched
arms
cry
in
the
severe
pains
of
travail
o
lost
souls
lost
souls
how
oft
would
i
have
gathered
thee
to
jesus
as
a
hen
gathers
her
brood
under
her
wing
but
ye
would
not
only
those
who
have
deep
travail
of
soul
for
the
lost
can
fully
rejoice
when
the
lost
are
found
one
of
the
apostles
said
he
served
the
lord
with
many
tears
a
heart
from
which
flows
no
tears
is
not
a
heart
that
is
wholly
imbued
by
the
spirit
of
god
tears
of
compassion
for
the
suffering
tears
of
warning
and
entreaty
for
the
lost
tears
of
joy
for
the
saved
will
flow
through
a
perfectly
holy
heart
as
freely
as
water
through
a
sieve
sunlight
perforates
the
block
of
ice
from
the
center
outward
so
the
love
of
god
perforates
the
heart
to
its
depths
and
lets
the
tears
of
affection
pity
and
sympathy
flow
out
do
not
try
to
escape
suffering
do
not
shut
your
heart
against
sorrow
it
is
the
bruised
flower
that
gives
out
the
sweetest
scent
open
thy
heart
to
god
and
let
him
bruise
it
let
sorrow
flow
in
and
break
it
that
sweetness
may
flow
out
when
the
poet
sang
i
no
trouble
and
no
sorrow
see
today
nor
will
i
borrow
gloomy
visions
for
the
morrow
he
sang
not
of
sorrow
for
souls
lost
in
sin
nor
of
needful
heaviness
through
manifold
temptations
nor
of
sorrow
awakened
by
the
suffering
of
others
but
of
that
sorrow
which
arises
from
the
world
through
distrust
and
separation
from
god
there
is
a
sorrow
which
comes
through
christ
it
is
as
the
refiner
fire
purifying
the
soul
and
binding
it
closer
to
god
such
sorrow
detaches
the
heart
from
the
world
and
from
self
and
hides
it
in
god
it
is
impossible
for
the
soul
to
approach
any
degree
of
nearness
to
christ
only
through
sorrow
and
suffering
in
my
own
experience
my
heart
once
longed
for
deeper
grace
my
whole
soul
breathed
out
o
jesus
give
me
more
meekness
for
a
few
days
a
heavy
cloud
of
sorrow
lay
upon
me
when
it
had
passed
away
i
had
an
answer
to
my
prayer
i
would
have
you
beware
of
that
unfeeling
state
in
which
one
has
no
sorrow
and
mistakingly
attributes
its
absence
to
grace
grace
helps
us
bear
sorrow
but
does
not
harden
our
hearts
against
it
sorrow
brings
us
to
a
throne
of
grace
for
grace
and
grace
brings
us
joy
so
that
we
have
joy
in
sorrow
no
other
joy
is
so
sweet
as
this
it
is
the
real
and
true
joy
of
christ
gentleness
trees
are
used
in
the
scriptures
to
represent
the
race
of
mankind
the
savior
likens
the
wicked
to
corrupt
trees
which
bear
evil
fruit
and
the
righteous
to
good
trees
which
bear
good
fruit
matt
he
also
teaches
very
emphatically
the
impossibility
of
one
being
a
good
tree
and
yet
bearing
evil
fruit
or
of
being
a
corrupt
tree
and
bearing
good
fruit
since
the
nature
of
the
fruit
we
bear
determines
what
manner
of
tree
we
are
it
is
very
advisable
that
we
as
professing
christians
should
frequently
examine
the
fruit
we
are
bearing
to
be
christ
or
to
be
a
christian
we
must
have
the
spirit
of
christ
for
the
scriptures
say
that
if
any
man
have
not
the
spirit
of
christ
he
is
none
of
his
rom
as
certainly
as
cause
produces
effect
those
who
have
the
spirit
of
christ
bear
the
fruit
of
the
spirit
not
to
bear
the
fruit
of
the
spirit
is
full
proof
that
you
have
not
the
spirit
then
a
close
examination
of
the
fruit
you
are
bearing
will
reveal
to
you
whether
or
not
you
have
the
spirit
of
christ
whether
or
not
you
are
his
whether
or
not
you
are
a
christian
you
can
make
a
superficial
examination
and
allow
yourself
to
be
deceived
you
can
make
excuses
for
yourself
because
of
your
weaknesses
and
thus
deceive
yourself
but
a
close
thorough
profound
examination
will
disclose
to
each
one
the
manner
of
spirit
he
is
of
gentleness
is
one
of
the
fruits
of
the
spirit
gal
if
we
have
the
spirit
of
christ
we
bear
this
fruit
well
says
one
in
my
very
make
i
am
rough
harsh
and
hasty
you
need
to
be
made
anew
when
god
finds
a
man
that
is
rough
harsh
and
severe
in
his
he
will
if
the
man
will
yield
to
the
operation
of
the
holy
spirit
make
him
mild
gentle
and
peaceful
people
go
to
a
hospital
and
by
a
scientific
operation
have
abscesses
and
tumors
removed
from
the
stomach
and
other
internal
parts
god
by
a
blessed
wonderful
and
successful
operation
of
the
holy
spirit
will
take
that
roughness
harshness
and
severity
out
of
your
nature
and
instil
mildness
tenderness
softness
and
gentleness
instead
harshness
and
roughness
are
a
corruption
that
god
in
his
gracious
plan
of
salvation
is
pleased
to
remove
if
you
will
allow
the
holy
spirit
to
work
in
you
that
which
is
pleasing
in
god
sight
he
will
make
you
gentle
what
is
gentleness
it
is
blandness
softness
mildness
and
meekness
it
is
the
opposite
of
harshness
roughness
etc
it
is
sweetness
of
disposition
mildness
of
temper
softness
of
manner
kindness
tenderness
etc
those
who
are
of
a
gentle
disposition
act
and
speak
without
asperity
they
are
not
morose
sour
crabbed
and
uneven
but
are
smooth
mild
and
even
good
manners
are
intimately
connected
with
gentleness
and
good
manners
are
no
dishonor
to
christianity
the
apostle
paul
by
way
of
testimony
said
to
the
thessalonian
saints
we
were
gentle
among
you
even
as
a
nurse
cherisheth
her
children
thess
such
was
his
manner
as
a
kind
mother
is
to
a
delicate
child
so
was
he
to
those
whom
he
loved
vastly
different
was
he
then
from
what
he
was
when
he
was
persecuting
and
wasting
the
church
of
god
he
had
been
changed
by
grace
he
exhorts
servants
of
the
lord
to
be
gentle
unto
all
men
tim
and
to
be
gentle
showing
all
meekness
unto
all
men
tit
david
in
his
sublime
tribute
of
praise
to
god
in
sam
says
thy
gentleness
hath
made
me
great
would
you
my
reader
like
to
be
more
gentle
in
your
manner
are
you
too
harsh
and
rough
are
you
if
a
parent
as
gentle
to
your
children
as
you
should
be
at
all
times
husband
are
you
as
kind
and
gentle
toward
your
wife
as
you
should
be
do
you
believe
you
fill
the
bible
measure
in
this
particular
are
you
as
gentle
to
your
domestic
animals
as
you
should
be
or
do
you
have
impatient
feelings
and
act
in
a
hasty
abrupt
manner
towards
them
if
you
meet
with
something
quite
provoking
from
your
wife
or
the
children
or
the
animals
do
you
keep
as
mild
and
sweet
as
you
know
you
should
now
i
hope
you
will
examine
closely
i
do
not
mean
to
condemn
you
i
want
to
help
you
there
are
many
professing
saints
today
who
are
not
nearly
so
gentle
as
they
should
be
why
not
be
in
earnest
and
seek
god
for
help
and
make
improvement
why
go
along
with
crossness
and
coldness
and
snappishness
in
your
life
be
gentle
toward
all
gentleness
is
a
beauteous
grace
her
excellence
is
great
by
culture
this
grace
is
capable
of
much
improvement
too
few
saints
experience
it
to
the
extent
they
should
i
beseech
you
by
the
gentleness
of
jesus
to
be
in
earnest
and
improve
upon
your
gentleness
never
allow
a
frown
or
a
scowl
to
settle
for
a
moment
upon
your
brow
it
will
leave
its
mark
if
you
do
so
learn
to
be
gentle
in
your
home
sometimes
when
far
away
from
home
you
picture
to
yourself
how
gentle
and
kind
and
loving
you
should
be
at
home
by
god
grace
you
can
be
just
as
gentle
as
you
see
in
the
picture
you
should
tenderness
in
order
for
life
to
be
what
it
should
it
must
flow
from
a
heart
full
of
tenderness
this
is
that
quality
of
soul
which
enables
us
to
give
kind
attention
to
others
to
be
willing
and
eager
to
do
good
to
exercise
great
carefulness
to
give
no
offense
and
to
be
soft
and
gentle
in
every
expression
like
all
other
good
qualities
this
is
found
in
perfection
in
the
character
of
god
the
lord
is
very
pitiful
and
of
tender
mercy
because
of
his
pity
he
never
lays
upon
his
trusting
child
a
greater
burden
than
he
can
bear
and
in
his
tender
mercy
he
always
gives
to
each
trial
a
happy
ending
it
will
be
helpful
to
study
for
a
few
minutes
the
principle
of
tenderness
as
an
attribute
in
the
nature
of
god
like
as
a
father
pitieth
his
children
so
the
lord
pitieth
them
that
fear
him
it
is
the
father
who
sees
his
little
child
in
deep
pain
that
knows
what
pity
is
it
is
that
feeling
which
makes
the
father
desirous
of
bearing
all
the
pain
it
was
the
pity
or
compassion
of
god
for
the
lost
in
sin
that
caused
him
to
give
his
only
son
to
suffer
and
die
for
them
when
god
saw
the
wretchedness
of
men
he
had
such
a
feeling
in
his
heart
that
he
could
find
relief
in
no
way
but
in
providing
the
only
means
of
their
rescue
oh
think
of
this
the
child
of
god
never
has
a
pain
or
a
sorrow
but
that
god
has
a
feeling
of
pity
the
knowledge
that
some
one
has
pity
for
us
and
fellowships
our
suffering
goes
far
toward
alleviating
our
pains
recently
while
i
was
in
deep
i
received
a
letter
containing
these
words
we
suffer
in
spirit
with
you
this
was
a
great
relief
if
in
a
time
of
trial
we
could
know
how
god
was
suffering
with
us
it
would
be
a
great
consolation
again
we
read
as
one
whom
his
mother
comforteth
so
will
i
comfort
you
and
ye
shall
be
comforted
in
jerusalem
who
is
it
that
knows
not
the
comfort
of
a
mother
when
we
hear
of
a
young
man
meeting
with
a
sad
accident
away
from
home
we
have
great
pity
but
when
we
learn
of
his
mother
having
gone
to
him
we
feel
better
ah
the
comfort
of
a
mother
is
surpassed
only
by
the
comfort
of
jesus
if
mother
were
only
here
says
the
troubled
daughter
nothing
else
so
fittingly
represents
the
nature
of
the
comfort
that
god
gives
as
the
comfort
of
a
mother
o
child
of
god
you
will
never
have
a
sorrow
nor
a
pain
but
that
the
tenderness
of
god
will
cause
him
to
come
and
comfort
you
let
us
lift
up
our
hearts
and
praise
him
for
his
mercy
and
comforting
love
a
mother
may
forget
to
comfort
her
child
but
god
will
never
forget
the
tenderness
of
god
is
revealed
in
these
touching
words
how
often
would
i
have
gathered
thy
children
together
as
a
hen
gathereth
her
chickens
under
her
wings
the
imagery
is
homely
but
oh
so
impressively
sublime
i
can
not
do
better
than
to
use
here
the
words
of
another
was
ever
imagery
so
homely
invested
with
such
grace
and
such
sublimity
as
this
at
our
lord
touch
and
yet
how
exquisite
the
figure
itself
of
protection
rest
warmth
and
all
manner
of
conscious
in
those
poor
defenseless
dependent
little
creatures
as
they
creep
under
and
feel
themselves
overshadowed
by
the
capacious
and
kindly
wing
of
the
mother
bird
if
wandering
beyond
hearing
of
her
peculiar
call
they
are
overtaken
by
a
storm
or
attacked
by
an
enemy
what
can
they
do
but
in
the
one
case
droop
and
die
and
in
the
other
submit
to
be
torn
to
pieces
but
if
they
can
reach
in
time
their
place
of
safety
under
the
mother
wing
in
vain
will
any
enemy
try
to
drag
them
thence
for
rising
into
strength
kindling
into
fury
and
forgetting
herself
entirely
in
her
young
she
will
let
the
last
drop
of
her
blood
be
shed
out
and
perish
in
defense
of
her
precious
charge
rather
than
yield
them
to
an
enemy
talons
how
significant
all
this
of
what
jesus
is
and
does
for
his
helpless
child
under
his
great
wing
he
tenderly
lovingly
gathers
his
little
ones
and
there
they
are
secure
he
is
a
safe
retreat
from
the
song
of
moses
we
learn
still
more
of
god
tender
care
as
an
eagle
stirreth
up
her
nest
fluttereth
over
her
young
spreadeth
abroad
her
wings
taketh
them
beareth
them
on
her
wings
so
the
lord
alone
did
lead
him
and
there
was
no
strange
god
with
him
this
metaphor
beautifully
expresses
the
care
and
the
tenderness
of
god
toward
his
children
the
eagle
is
noted
for
her
great
attachment
to
her
young
her
care
is
extraordinary
when
the
little
eaglets
have
attained
age
and
strength
to
leave
the
nest
and
learn
to
fly
the
mother
bird
bears
them
up
when
weary
on
the
top
of
her
wing
these
all
express
to
our
hearts
the
wonderful
tenderness
of
god
to
his
children
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
material
world
that
forms
a
full
and
perfect
analogy
for
the
things
in
the
spiritual
world
these
are
too
high
if
we
do
not
have
the
tenderness
of
god
in
our
hearts
our
life
comes
short
of
being
a
full
and
true
life
the
bible
tells
us
to
be
kind
one
to
another
there
is
no
true
holiness
of
life
without
tenderness
as
we
get
deeper
into
god
we
become
more
tender
of
heart
there
are
some
things
that
will
prevent
this
just
a
little
feeling
of
resentment
a
little
desire
for
retaliation
or
a
secret
wish
for
something
to
befall
those
who
have
done
us
an
injury
will
callous
the
heart
and
harden
the
affections
when
we
have
been
slighted
by
some
one
or
misjudged
oh
how
satan
strives
to
get
us
to
thinking
much
about
this
and
to
work
a
hurt
feeling
into
our
heart
even
to
think
about
the
meanness
of
others
will
bring
a
harshness
and
coldness
into
the
inner
life
that
which
we
condemn
in
others
will
if
we
think
and
talk
much
about
it
creep
into
our
own
hearts
you
say
you
are
saved
and
sanctified
thank
god
for
such
a
blessed
experience
but
you
have
much
yet
to
gain
you
have
not
yet
attained
to
the
full
depth
of
anything
there
is
yet
a
tenderness
of
heart
you
can
reach
only
through
many
and
varied
experiences
there
is
tenderness
of
voice
tenderness
of
manner
tenderness
of
feeling
tenderness
of
thought
you
will
attain
to
only
through
much
and
deep
communion
with
god
it
is
those
intimate
and
familiar
talks
with
jesus
that
fashion
us
into
his
glorious
image
a
brother
minister
related
to
me
a
few
mornings
ago
his
experience
of
the
night
before
he
lay
awake
he
said
for
a
long
time
and
had
a
sweet
talk
with
the
lord
so
intimate
was
the
communion
that
turning
over
to
go
to
sleep
he
said
half
unthinkingly
good
night
as
if
parting
from
a
dear
friend
such
close
union
with
jesus
gives
us
clearer
visions
of
his
character
and
stamps
his
beauty
upon
our
souls
have
you
not
seen
those
who
are
harsh
rough
and
unfeeling
in
their
speech
and
manner
no
one
wants
to
be
like
them
we
are
glad
to
get
away
from
them
they
measure
a
person
by
their
standard
and
if
he
is
not
what
they
think
he
should
be
they
speak
about
him
in
an
unloving
and
unfeeling
manner
we
feel
that
something
coarse
and
flinty
needs
to
be
taken
out
of
their
nature
we
do
not
say
they
are
not
sanctified
but
they
are
too
bitter
and
severe
they
need
to
be
bathed
in
the
love
of
god
they
need
to
be
immersed
in
the
sea
of
his
gentleness
we
have
seen
on
the
other
hand
those
who
were
so
feeling
so
quiet
tender
and
gentle
that
their
presence
was
like
the
breath
of
a
sweet
spring
morning
there
was
a
tenderness
in
their
eye
a
softness
in
their
voice
a
pathos
in
their
feeling
that
cast
over
your
soul
a
sense
of
delight
there
is
much
for
us
to
gain
but
we
can
gain
it
only
at
the
end
of
the
bayonet
if
we
would
win
we
must
fight
there
is
no
victory
without
battle
one
brother
after
gaining
a
decisive
victory
said
the
devil
is
dead
he
was
so
victorious
and
free
that
he
thought
the
devil
must
be
dead
in
a
short
time
however
the
brother
learned
his
mistake
the
prince
of
the
power
of
the
air
still
lives
and
we
still
have
our
humanity
if
we
are
not
prayerful
and
watchful
we
become
disposed
to
contend
for
our
way
to
feel
a
little
bitter
if
we
are
trampled
upon
jesus
tells
us
to
resist
not
evil
we
are
not
only
to
not
resist
evil
outwardly
but
to
have
no
resisting
feeling
in
our
hearts
if
we
would
have
holiness
of
life
we
must
have
tenderness
of
spirit
if
you
desire
your
life
to
be
like
the
oasis
in
the
desert
where
the
weary
traveler
is
refreshed
be
tender
of
heart
be
compassionate
bear
every
trial
with
patience
endure
all
suffering
without
a
murmur
commune
much
with
god
and
he
will
bring
you
out
into
that
tenderness
of
soul
that
will
make
your
life
everywhere
you
go
like
the
atmosphere
of
heaven
the
christian
walk
life
is
termed
a
walk
in
the
scriptures
where
they
say
that
we
ought
to
walk
as
jesus
walked
they
have
reference
to
our
manner
of
life
the
way
in
which
a
christian
walks
is
called
the
way
of
life
it
is
called
the
way
of
life
because
it
leads
to
a
land
of
life
a
place
where
death
never
enters
where
all
is
life
and
life
forevermore
the
christian
walks
in
the
way
that
leads
to
that
land
of
life
there
is
also
a
place
of
death
and
the
way
there
is
called
the
way
of
death
the
way
along
which
the
christian
walks
is
a
narrow
way
strait
is
the
gate
and
narrow
is
the
way
that
leadeth
unto
life
but
we
need
have
no
fear
for
although
it
is
narrow
it
is
not
dark
thy
word
is
a
lamp
unto
my
feet
and
a
light
unto
my
path
i
would
rather
walk
in
a
narrow
way
in
full
light
than
in
a
broad
way
in
the
dark
the
word
of
god
lights
up
the
christian
pathway
how
beautifully
the
electric
lights
light
up
the
walks
in
the
city
park
there
is
no
danger
of
stumbling
the
bible
is
a
light
along
the
way
of
life
and
it
lights
the
way
beautifully
not
one
step
need
be
taken
in
the
dark
there
is
light
for
every
step
of
the
way
sometimes
the
christian
may
think
he
has
reached
a
dark
place
but
if
he
will
open
his
bible
he
will
find
a
light
to
lighten
that
very
spot
the
christian
is
to
walk
circumspectly
see
then
that
ye
walk
circumspectly
eph
to
walk
circumspectly
is
to
walk
cautiously
to
look
where
one
is
stepping
to
be
vigilant
watchful
diligent
attentive
be
our
pathway
ever
so
light
if
we
do
not
look
where
we
are
stepping
we
may
stumble
conybeare
and
howson
render
the
above
text
in
these
words
see
then
that
ye
walk
without
stumbling
we
are
to
walk
not
as
foolish
people
but
as
wise
we
would
say
that
the
man
acts
foolishly
who
does
not
look
at
all
in
the
way
he
is
walking
those
who
are
wise
in
business
walk
carefully
they
look
where
they
are
going
they
take
advantage
of
every
opportunity
to
make
their
business
a
success
in
our
christian
walk
we
are
to
seize
upon
every
opportunity
to
make
progress
there
is
no
time
in
this
short
life
for
ease
carelessness
and
indolence
are
dangerous
and
destructive
to
spirituality
an
indolent
man
will
never
accomplish
much
for
god
nor
be
of
any
great
benefit
to
his
fellow
men
but
oh
how
easy
to
become
careless
many
begin
the
christian
walk
in
carefulness
and
diligence
but
soon
give
place
to
carelessness
and
neglect
how
prone
people
are
to
lose
interest
in
anything
when
the
new
has
worn
away
they
take
great
interest
in
the
new
preacher
but
they
will
become
so
familiar
with
him
and
so
accustomed
to
him
that
they
will
lose
interest
they
have
never
heard
any
one
preach
so
well
as
the
new
preacher
and
what
he
says
has
such
weight
and
authority
but
behold
after
the
new
has
worn
away
he
can
not
preach
any
better
than
any
other
they
have
no
more
regard
for
his
words
than
they
have
for
the
words
of
others
there
is
an
old
adage
which
says
a
new
broom
sweeps
clean
the
boy
is
eager
to
cut
wood
with
the
new
ax
a
child
will
carefully
write
like
the
copy
for
the
first
few
lines
but
the
farther
down
the
page
the
greater
the
carelessness
the
young
lady
takes
great
interest
in
the
music
lessons
at
first
she
wants
to
practise
all
the
time
but
it
soon
gets
old
and
then
it
is
hard
to
keep
up
an
interest
the
husband
is
very
loving
kind
and
attentive
to
his
wife
for
a
while
but
alas
in
a
little
while
she
becomes
old
to
him
and
then
he
lets
her
shift
for
herself
this
need
not
and
should
not
be
but
it
seems
to
be
the
nature
of
man
in
the
christian
life
there
is
a
strong
tendency
to
let
things
run
down
some
persons
hear
a
sermon
and
they
are
awakened
but
they
are
soon
lulled
to
sleep
again
perhaps
the
example
of
some
one
has
shown
them
that
they
do
not
pray
enough
and
they
resolve
to
pray
more
but
they
soon
drift
into
the
same
careless
way
maybe
they
see
that
they
do
not
read
enough
and
improve
themselves
and
they
are
greatly
stirred
to
do
better
but
alas
how
soon
they
allow
that
resolution
to
weaken
and
become
as
negligent
as
ever
nothing
but
the
greatest
diligence
and
unyielding
determination
will
save
us
from
getting
weary
in
welldoing
keep
up
a
strong
faith
hold
your
mansion
in
the
skies
well
in
view
and
let
nothing
hinder
you
in
your
journey
home
there
are
professed
christians
who
i
am
sorry
to
say
never
take
a
good
look
at
their
mansion
in
heaven
and
it
is
to
be
feared
that
many
who
are
really
god
children
do
not
view
their
home
above
as
often
and
distinctly
as
they
should
they
see
more
of
temporal
things
than
of
eternal
things
it
is
by
faith
that
we
see
eternal
things
but
if
we
have
too
keen
a
vision
for
temporal
things
it
dims
our
spiritual
vision
if
you
knew
you
had
a
fine
home
in
an
adjoining
state
and
you
had
never
seen
it
you
would
want
some
one
who
had
seen
it
to
give
you
a
description
of
it
perhaps
you
would
want
a
photograph
of
it
you
would
take
a
look
at
the
picture
often
and
would
learn
all
about
it
you
could
and
would
think
of
the
time
when
you
could
go
and
live
there
now
jesus
tells
you
that
he
has
prepared
a
mansion
for
you
in
heaven
he
does
not
tell
you
much
about
it
but
you
know
full
well
that
a
mansion
that
jesus
prepares
is
perfect
and
complete
why
not
think
much
about
this
mansion
why
not
view
it
often
by
faith
why
not
learn
all
about
it
you
can
getting
too
much
engaged
with
the
things
of
this
life
is
the
reason
why
to
walk
circumspectly
is
to
see
that
every
step
bears
us
heavenward
to
have
our
faces
set
toward
god
to
have
our
eternal
home
in
view
and
to
be
journeying
that
way
we
are
not
to
be
sauntering
along
but
to
be
industriously
living
for
god
and
heaven
how
often
have
you
decided
that
you
would
be
more
prayerful
would
read
more
would
love
god
more
and
the
souls
of
men
would
do
more
for
the
cause
of
god
how
often
you
have
decided
to
walk
more
worthily
of
god
to
be
more
patient
to
live
a
higher
life
to
be
slower
to
speak
to
cultivate
a
spirit
of
love
and
kindness
to
be
more
like
jesus
you
started
out
well
and
with
great
diligence
but
alas
ere
long
you
became
weary
in
you
became
less
vigilant
you
did
not
walk
so
carefully
and
were
less
attentive
to
your
way
one
day
a
circumstance
occurred
that
caused
a
brother
to
see
that
he
was
not
as
attentive
to
others
as
he
should
be
and
let
many
opportunities
of
helping
others
in
little
things
go
by
unimproved
he
decided
that
he
would
be
more
watchful
and
thus
be
more
helpful
but
as
he
said
he
soon
became
as
negligent
as
ever
time
after
time
he
resolved
and
as
often
became
negligent
do
not
be
discouraged
a
little
more
determination
a
little
more
faith
in
god
for
help
and
you
will
triumph
the
christian
walk
a
walk
with
god
he
hath
showed
thee
o
man
what
is
good
and
what
doth
the
lord
require
of
thee
but
to
do
justly
and
to
love
mercy
and
to
walk
humbly
with
thy
god
micah
the
life
of
enoch
is
descriptive
of
the
christian
life
and
it
is
said
that
he
walked
with
god
hand
in
hand
with
god
heart
in
heart
and
life
in
life
is
the
true
christian
way
in
order
to
walk
thus
with
god
we
must
be
in
agreement
with
him
for
two
can
not
walk
together
heart
in
heart
unless
they
be
in
agreement
to
be
agreed
with
god
implies
submission
to
the
divine
will
it
is
to
go
where
he
leads
he
leadeth
me
is
the
sentiment
of
the
christian
heart
he
may
sometimes
lead
in
a
laborious
path
nevertheless
we
go
he
may
lead
in
a
way
that
brings
suffering
and
he
may
take
our
loved
ones
from
us
he
may
call
somebody
dear
to
us
to
a
foreign
field
or
he
may
call
us
if
we
would
walk
with
him
we
must
not
draw
back
but
say
lord
thy
will
be
done
i
will
go
with
thee
all
the
way
such
a
walk
may
lead
over
some
thorny
paths
and
through
some
waters
and
fiery
trials
but
it
pleases
god
and
ends
in
heaven
so
onward
let
us
go
the
latest
improved
as
we
walk
along
the
streets
of
villages
and
cities
we
see
machines
of
different
kinds
exposed
to
view
and
bearing
a
card
with
these
words
the
latest
improved
for
our
life
to
be
perfect
every
day
it
must
be
our
latest
improved
the
world
is
getting
worse
we
say
but
you
and
i
as
christians
can
daily
grow
better
our
life
today
can
be
an
improvement
over
our
life
of
yesterday
the
christian
life
is
a
real
life
and
is
as
capable
of
development
as
any
life
the
same
law
that
develops
us
physically
is
necessary
to
our
development
spiritually
day
after
day
we
can
be
built
up
into
stronger
spiritual
beings
we
can
become
more
like
god
possessing
a
firmer
christian
character
and
having
an
integrity
that
will
not
swerve
for
a
life
nor
a
world
from
the
path
of
virtue
constant
progress
is
constant
peace
and
happiness
it
is
the
triumphant
life
dear
reader
i
am
going
to
ask
you
to
lay
aside
for
a
few
minutes
the
busy
cares
of
life
and
come
and
have
a
talk
with
me
about
spiritual
and
heavenly
things
now
if
you
feel
that
you
scarcely
have
the
time
and
can
not
fully
dismiss
the
temporal
concerns
of
life
from
your
mind
then
i
will
excuse
you
i
do
not
care
to
speak
with
you
unless
you
can
give
me
your
undivided
attention
i
desire
to
help
you
if
you
need
help
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
your
life
and
i
do
want
your
calm
serious
attention
surely
by
god
help
we
can
spend
a
few
minutes
to
some
profit
some
people
hesitate
to
look
closely
into
their
life
lest
they
find
such
a
delinquency
as
will
disquiet
them
some
fear
to
give
a
close
examination
lest
it
give
satan
an
opportunity
to
accuse
them
this
need
not
be
we
can
look
closely
into
our
daily
life
and
not
allow
satan
to
whisper
one
word
to
us
we
can
not
make
improvement
upon
our
life
without
close
examination
in
order
to
discover
weakness
and
imperfections
when
we
discover
them
we
must
set
earnestly
to
work
to
correct
them
the
discovery
alone
is
not
sufficient
if
we
do
not
correct
a
fault
that
we
have
discovered
we
soon
lose
consciousness
of
the
fault
there
are
times
with
every
one
no
doubt
when
it
seems
that
they
are
making
no
progress
but
these
may
be
the
times
when
we
are
making
most
progress
if
we
have
just
one
fault
we
ought
to
desire
to
get
rid
of
it
our
desire
should
be
so
great
that
we
shall
set
about
at
once
to
correct
that
fault
now
if
we
say
oh
it
is
such
a
little
thing
then
we
shall
not
get
free
from
it
and
that
little
thing
may
become
a
greater
thing
to
be
too
quick
to
speak
is
a
fault
the
bible
says
be
slow
to
speak
if
we
have
the
fault
of
speaking
too
quickly
we
should
correct
that
we
can
if
we
will
the
bible
tells
christians
to
watch
and
pray
christians
do
not
need
to
watch
and
pray
lest
they
rob
a
bank
they
would
not
rob
a
bank
if
they
never
prayed
but
we
do
need
to
watch
arid
pray
lest
we
do
some
little
thing
that
we
should
not
do
i
will
relate
to
you
the
experience
of
a
dear
brother
who
desired
to
live
for
god
but
who
neglected
to
watch
and
pray
as
he
should
an
evil
thought
was
presented
to
his
mind
not
seeing
the
evil
of
it
he
indulged
the
thought
and
found
pleasure
in
the
indulgence
after
a
few
minutes
he
felt
the
reproving
of
the
spirit
of
god
and
so
dismissed
the
thought
later
it
came
again
it
was
so
pleasing
that
he
indulged
it
a
little
longer
than
before
again
the
spirit
reproved
him
in
a
few
evenings
the
thought
came
again
it
was
only
a
little
sensual
thought
a
little
imaginary
indulgence
of
the
flesh
but
it
came
again
and
again
it
was
indulged
a
little
longer
and
a
little
longer
eventually
it
worked
a
fleshly
lust
into
his
heart
and
after
two
or
three
years
he
was
led
into
actual
commission
of
a
sinful
deed
it
was
an
apparently
innocent
thought
in
the
beginning
but
it
ended
in
sin
committed
there
are
little
yieldings
to
lightness
impatience
aircastle
building
exaggerations
frettings
murmurings
idleness
that
prey
upon
the
soul
and
rob
it
of
peace
and
the
sweet
consciousness
of
god
presence
but
there
is
progress
in
the
divine
life
for
every
one
of
us
if
we
will
only
give
attention
to
our
life
as
we
pass
along
the
first
thing
is
to
have
a
deep
interest
in
making
spiritual
gain
and
then
to
be
full
of
faith
and
encouragement
jesus
will
help
you
to
make
some
gains
each
day
if
you
will
press
your
way
through
the
crowd
and
touch
him
it
is
the
earnest
prayer
of
faith
that
gets
us
through
to
god
and
makes
us
feel
like
giants
in
his
strength
if
you
would
be
strengthened
in
your
soul
you
must
exercise
this
is
the
law
of
development
in
the
spiritual
as
well
as
in
the
animal
life
exercise
thyself
unto
godliness
this
is
a
motto
we
should
hang
upon
the
walls
of
our
memory
its
meaning
is
that
increase
in
godliness
is
attained
only
by
exercise
i
shall
have
much
now
to
say
about
your
doing
but
bear
in
mind
that
the
doing
is
to
be
not
in
your
strength
but
in
god
strength
here
are
two
mottos
to
keep
in
remembrance
without
him
i
can
do
nothing
i
can
do
all
things
through
christ
who
strengtheneth
me
by
the
help
of
the
lord
we
are
going
to
tell
you
how
to
be
strong
in
him
god
wants
you
to
be
a
david
go
out
in
his
strength
and
meet
the
goliaths
they
must
fall
before
you
i
shall
not
tell
you
so
much
you
do
not
know
as
i
shall
endeavor
to
get
you
to
practise
what
you
know
how
many
times
have
you
resolved
to
do
and
have
failed
to
keep
your
resolution
your
failure
was
not
because
you
could
not
but
because
you
did
not
to
make
a
success
in
any
business
enterprise
one
must
give
it
constant
and
daily
attention
likewise
if
you
make
a
success
in
the
christian
life
you
must
give
it
constant
and
daily
attention
you
must
make
it
not
only
i
a
business
but
i
the
first
business
of
your
life
but
some
make
this
complaint
it
takes
so
much
time
it
will
take
some
time
that
is
true
and
if
you
do
not
think
you
have
time
then
you
had
better
not
begin
what
would
you
think
of
a
man
who
contemplated
engaging
in
some
business
but
said
he
did
not
have
much
time
to
devote
to
it
you
would
advise
him
not
to
engage
in
the
business
at
all
it
takes
time
to
make
advancement
in
the
christian
life
one
brother
said
but
we
must
attend
to
our
temporal
duties
my
reply
was
shall
we
not
attend
to
our
spiritual
duties
when
people
talk
of
having
to
attend
to
temporal
duties
it
appears
that
they
are
going
to
do
this
if
they
have
to
neglect
spiritual
duties
unless
we
have
a
better
enlightenment
than
this
we
shall
never
make
progress
in
the
christian
life
we
have
no
excuse
for
not
being
strong
in
the
lord
watch
ye
stand
fast
in
the
faith
quit
you
like
men
be
strong
of
course
you
need
the
help
of
god
but
god
helps
those
who
help
themselves
he
will
not
by
some
irresistible
power
convey
you
to
your
closet
and
put
you
on
your
knees
but
he
will
give
you
strength
to
go
if
you
will
use
what
he
gives
you
i
will
now
give
you
not
learned
theology
but
plain
simple
instruction
how
to
make
daily
advancement
in
the
divine
life
and
to
be
strong
in
god
dearly
beloved
i
beseech
you
as
strangers
and
pilgrims
abstain
from
fleshly
lusts
which
war
against
the
soul
i
pet
any
indulgence
of
the
flesh
weakens
the
spiritual
powers
the
question
might
arise
what
are
fleshly
lusts
we
are
here
in
the
flesh
the
flesh
has
not
only
its
desires
but
its
needs
to
indulge
the
flesh
in
its
needs
is
not
fleshly
lust
but
to
indulge
it
in
any
thing
beyond
its
actual
needs
is
fleshly
lusts
in
other
words
any
intemperance
is
lust
of
the
flesh
temperance
is
a
fruit
of
the
spirit
we
are
to
add
temperance
to
our
knowledge
the
more
knowledge
we
get
of
the
divine
character
the
more
clearly
we
can
discriminate
between
fleshly
lusts
and
temperance
i
keep
my
body
under
and
bring
it
into
subjection
says
the
apostle
paul
he
spoke
these
words
when
talking
about
running
to
obtain
an
incorruptible
crown
he
calls
our
attention
to
how
people
run
to
obtain
a
corruptible
crown
and
every
man
he
says
that
striveth
for
the
mastery
i
is
temperate
in
all
things
if
men
must
be
temperate
in
all
things
in
order
to
obtain
a
corruptible
crown
how
much
more
temperate
must
we
be
in
order
to
obtain
an
incorruptible
crown
if
the
soul
does
not
keep
the
body
under
the
body
will
keep
the
soul
under
but
this
keeping
under
does
not
consist
in
many
prayers
in
long
vigils
and
fasts
in
severe
chastenings
of
the
body
in
dwelling
in
a
cloister
or
being
a
hermit
do
not
make
this
sad
mistake
his
yoke
is
easy
and
his
burden
is
light
yet
the
christian
life
is
one
of
but
his
love
in
our
hearts
makes
it
a
delight
we
are
not
to
keep
our
bodies
under
by
prolonged
fasts
and
beatings
but
to
keep
in
control
the
that
is
natural
to
the
of
man
the
pure
in
heart
have
organs
of
sense
are
capable
of
feeling
the
impressions
made
by
external
objects
it
is
natural
for
the
individual
life
of
the
sanctified
to
seek
ease
and
comfort
this
is
not
the
nature
of
the
divine
life
in
the
soul
but
is
the
nature
of
the
of
man
adam
and
eve
had
this
in
the
purity
of
their
creation
they
had
organs
of
sense
it
was
to
these
that
satan
made
his
appeals
to
the
feelings
in
their
not
to
the
feelings
in
the
divine
life
of
their
soul
the
will
of
sense
for
such
it
might
be
called
overpowered
that
higher
will
of
the
soul
and
they
yielded
to
the
will
of
sense
as
aroused
by
temptation
we
who
are
pure
in
heart
have
this
same
will
of
sense
it
is
this
will
of
sense
that
must
be
kept
under
or
in
control
to
the
will
of
god
not
my
will
that
is
that
lower
will
of
my
self
said
jesus
but
thy
will
be
done
i
will
make
this
plainer
as
we
go
on
i
feel
like
making
it
as
plain
and
simple
as
i
can
even
if
doing
so
does
require
time
because
here
lies
the
secret
of
success
in
the
christian
life
those
who
look
upon
the
instructions
herein
as
trifling
will
do
so
to
their
own
spiritual
injury
it
is
natural
for
us
to
avoid
hardship
and
suffering
this
is
not
wrong
of
itself
it
is
wrong
only
when
it
conflicts
with
the
will
of
god
it
is
not
wrong
for
you
to
avoid
burning
at
the
stake
unless
it
be
god
will
that
you
should
thus
end
your
life
if
god
wills
you
to
burn
at
the
stake
you
must
not
seek
to
avoid
the
ordeal
if
we
do
not
watch
carefully
and
live
close
to
god
and
keep
our
body
under
the
will
of
sense
will
grow
strong
and
cause
us
to
avoid
hardships
even
when
god
wills
us
to
undergo
them
be
careful
that
you
do
not
mistake
the
impulse
of
sense
for
the
divine
will
one
may
say
he
does
not
believe
it
to
be
god
will
that
he
undergo
this
suffering
when
it
may
be
only
his
own
humanity
out
of
human
sympathy
we
may
try
to
dissuade
our
brother
from
doing
the
will
of
god
at
caesarea
certain
brethren
tried
out
of
mere
sympathy
to
persuade
paul
not
to
go
to
jerusalem
where
it
was
prophesied
he
should
be
bound
and
delivered
to
the
gentiles
seeing
that
he
would
not
be
persuaded
they
gave
place
to
that
higher
will
and
said
the
will
of
the
lord
be
done
this
is
not
confined
to
the
greater
affairs
of
life
such
as
burning
at
the
stake
but
includes
the
little
affairs
of
life
how
easy
it
is
for
man
to
conclude
it
is
the
will
of
god
for
him
to
do
a
certain
thing
when
perhaps
it
is
only
the
will
of
sense
remember
god
ways
are
not
as
our
ways
it
seems
to
be
a
most
reasonable
thing
to
the
minister
that
he
should
go
home
to
his
family
how
easy
it
is
for
him
to
believe
it
is
god
will
that
he
should
go
at
least
it
has
been
so
many
times
with
the
writer
he
has
too
often
obeyed
the
human
desire
and
disobeyed
god
such
disobedience
if
such
it
may
be
called
is
not
sin
since
the
will
of
god
is
not
known
but
it
is
being
led
by
the
impulse
of
sense
and
is
detrimental
to
spirituality
god
would
have
us
look
more
earnestly
to
him
in
order
to
know
his
will
and
not
yield
so
readily
to
mere
human
desires
to
enjoy
nearness
to
god
we
must
not
be
influenced
by
any
will
of
sense
the
impulse
of
sense
is
so
deceptive
that
if
we
are
not
very
watchful
and
fully
surrendered
to
god
with
an
intense
desire
to
know
and
do
his
will
it
will
prevent
our
understanding
his
will
to
us
it
may
not
be
difficult
to
convince
you
that
it
is
god
will
that
your
brother
should
go
as
a
missionary
to
some
foreign
field
but
very
difficult
to
convince
you
that
it
is
god
will
for
you
to
go
when
perhaps
it
is
just
as
reasonable
every
way
that
you
should
go
it
may
be
the
will
of
sense
to
remain
that
prevents
your
knowing
god
will
here
is
a
truth
i
wish
you
to
think
upon
we
can
not
see
the
folly
of
any
passion
clearly
when
we
are
strongly
tempted
by
that
passion
a
sanctified
man
may
eat
too
much
sometimes
he
may
be
intemperate
sometimes
in
the
sexual
relation
and
yet
the
word
of
god
says
whether
ye
eat
or
drink
or
whatsoever
ye
do
do
all
to
the
glory
of
god
let
me
say
however
that
those
who
enjoy
deep
union
and
communion
with
god
are
careful
to
be
temperate
in
their
entire
manner
of
life
as
we
have
stated
before
the
pure
in
heart
have
organs
of
sense
these
organs
can
be
impressed
by
external
objects
these
impressions
may
properly
be
termed
feelings
a
man
filled
with
the
holy
spirit
may
when
being
praised
by
some
unwise
person
be
tempted
to
pride
in
other
words
he
feels
a
sense
of
pride
this
feeling
is
in
the
of
the
man
a
sanctified
man
is
tempted
to
impatience
he
feels
a
sense
of
impatience
not
carnal
but
as
an
impulse
of
sense
in
the
when
some
one
does
something
contrary
to
your
pleasure
or
wishes
you
may
have
feelings
of
displeasure
or
impatience
the
patience
of
a
mother
is
sometimes
tried
by
the
conduct
of
a
child
the
trying
of
patience
is
simply
feelings
of
impatience
in
the
but
in
her
patience
she
is
to
possess
her
soul
these
feelings
of
impatience
are
to
be
resisted
in
the
strength
of
the
lord
resist
them
with
a
prayer
i
have
now
brought
you
to
the
place
where
i
am
ready
to
tell
you
how
to
grow
in
grace
how
to
increase
how
to
make
progress
in
the
divine
life
which
is
all
that
is
meant
by
the
expressions
getting
closer
to
god
becoming
more
like
christ
etc
remember
this
are
strengthened
by
being
indulged
you
are
tempted
to
pride
to
lightness
to
impatience
you
have
feelings
of
pride
lightness
impatience
for
this
is
what
temptations
are
these
feelings
should
be
immediately
and
indignantly
resisted
get
after
them
in
earnest
the
very
exercise
of
resisting
is
what
will
develop
and
strengthen
the
spiritual
powers
but
if
the
feelings
are
indulged
they
will
grow
stronger
and
the
spiritual
powers
grow
weaker
if
you
value
your
spiritual
prosperity
you
will
be
very
quick
to
resist
every
temptation
sometimes
people
allow
a
tried
mean
impatient
feeling
to
settle
down
upon
them
for
hours
they
do
not
feel
pleasant
neither
do
they
look
pleasant
such
feelings
leave
their
trace
behind
they
are
a
dangerous
foe
loathe
them
despise
them
go
to
the
lord
in
earnest
prayer
and
pray
until
joy
springs
up
in
the
soul
a
smile
beams
on
the
face
and
the
bad
feelings
are
made
to
fly
away
like
a
startled
bird
some
say
we
can
not
prevent
bad
feelings
and
thoughts
from
attacking
us
they
use
the
words
of
luther
we
can
not
prevent
birds
flying
over
our
heads
but
can
prevent
them
from
building
nests
in
our
hair
it
is
no
sin
nor
source
of
discouragement
to
be
attacked
by
bad
feelings
and
bad
thoughts
but
bear
in
mind
that
we
can
frighten
the
birds
that
are
flying
over
and
thus
make
them
fly
quickly
and
that
after
being
frightened
a
few
times
they
will
fly
far
around
or
very
high
over
so
with
bad
feelings
and
thoughts
if
earnestly
and
indignantly
resisted
they
will
fly
away
quickly
and
their
assaults
will
grow
weaker
and
weaker
it
is
god
will
that
we
eat
drink
and
sleep
but
to
be
intemperate
in
these
is
to
destroy
spiritual
life
we
should
be
guided
by
a
sense
of
the
divine
will
and
not
by
a
sense
of
human
desire
to
yield
to
the
lower
will
of
sense
is
to
be
soon
abandoned
to
self
and
destitute
of
grace
i
have
been
asked
whether
it
is
possible
for
us
to
attain
such
a
degree
of
perfection
that
we
should
never
speak
a
harsh
impatient
word
or
a
light
word
or
be
the
least
intemperate
in
any
way
my
answer
is
that
by
much
prayer
by
close
watching
and
earnest
resisting
the
will
of
sense
can
be
so
weakened
and
the
soul
become
so
habituated
to
act
under
a
sense
of
the
divine
will
that
foolish
or
impatient
words
impulsive
actions
or
any
intemperance
will
be
very
few
and
far
between
this
is
being
strong
in
the
grace
of
god
again
i
have
been
asked
can
we
reach
a
place
where
we
shall
be
no
more
tempted
yes
if
you
are
earnest
and
faithful
you
will
reach
it
when
you
arrive
in
that
land
where
flesh
and
blood
can
not
enter
there
you
will
no
more
be
tempted
but
as
long
as
you
are
here
in
the
flesh
you
will
be
tempted
in
the
very
nature
of
things
you
need
to
be
your
spiritual
powers
would
weaken
if
they
had
nothing
to
resist
let
me
here
acquaint
you
with
a
device
of
satan
all
these
attacks
upon
the
will
of
sense
are
made
by
the
devil
he
will
use
some
external
object
to
try
you
he
may
withhold
temptation
for
a
long
time
in
order
that
you
may
become
careless
and
cease
to
watch
and
pray
and
thus
in
a
measure
lose
your
power
of
resistance
then
he
will
come
in
with
a
slight
attack
so
slight
you
will
not
detect
it
in
your
weakened
state
if
it
be
an
attack
to
impatience
you
will
speak
a
little
hastily
but
will
scarcely
perceive
it
and
will
think
it
of
little
consequence
but
his
attacks
will
grow
stronger
your
words
will
grow
more
hasty
there
will
be
frettings
and
worryings
and
you
will
be
so
stupid
that
you
will
not
be
aware
of
your
backsliding
do
not
cease
your
watching
and
praying
even
if
you
have
no
temptations
alas
how
many
have
gone
down
under
this
cunning
device
of
satan
this
is
a
scheme
he
plays
well
when
the
christian
first
starts
out
on
his
pilgrimage
he
is
watchful
and
prayerful
an
attack
of
satan
startles
him
and
he
becomes
earnest
in
his
resistance
if
he
speaks
impatiently
or
lightly
he
flees
at
once
to
god
for
grace
and
thus
he
grows
in
grace
but
if
he
becomes
strong
and
his
soul
forms
the
habit
of
acting
in
holiness
he
feels
strong
and
ceases
his
close
watching
and
praying
and
resisting
then
he
slowly
but
surely
retrogrades
unless
he
is
in
some
way
awakened
he
will
backslide
but
the
question
arises
how
can
we
keep
up
resistance
in
order
to
be
strong
if
satan
ceases
to
tempt
have
sham
battles
in
time
of
peace
soldiers
are
constantly
drilling
so
that
they
may
be
prepared
when
they
come
to
battle
pugilists
go
through
much
training
in
preparation
for
the
actual
contest
so
we
are
to
watch
constantly
keep
the
soul
in
a
defensive
attitude
this
is
what
i
mean
by
sham
battles
bearing
in
mind
that
you
may
be
attacked
at
any
time
keep
the
soul
in
a
defensive
attitude
keep
up
the
shield
of
faith
the
very
exercise
of
holding
up
the
shield
and
keeping
the
soul
in
watchings
makes
it
strong
for
the
battle
if
you
do
not
exercise
your
soul
in
earnest
prayer
each
morning
satan
will
likely
catch
you
that
day
unprepared
for
the
perfecting
of
the
soul
in
the
habit
of
holiness
you
must
exercise
yourself
in
inward
acts
of
resistance
keep
an
intense
hatred
of
sin
and
the
devil
get
where
you
enjoy
a
contest
with
satan
glory
in
tribulation
rejoice
when
you
are
persecuted
count
it
joy
when
you
are
tried
and
tempted
soldiers
get
so
they
love
the
battle
pugilists
enjoy
the
contest
and
we
should
be
where
we
love
trials
we
hate
them
therefore
we
love
to
conquer
them
they
afford
us
means
for
development
therefore
we
welcome
them
they
deepen
us
into
god
and
make
us
more
like
christ
therefore
we
hail
them
with
joy
we
hate
them
themselves
but
in
our
intense
love
for
god
and
the
privilege
of
exercising
ourselves
in
his
strength
we
count
all
our
trials
joy
we
rejoice
in
the
midst
of
temptation
because
we
have
the
opportunity
of
displaying
the
strength
of
our
god
but
do
not
make
the
mistake
of
thinking
that
you
are
so
strong
in
god
that
the
little
evil
thought
or
the
feeling
of
pride
or
impatience
or
the
little
act
of
intemperance
is
of
no
consequence
it
is
these
little
things
that
sap
away
the
spiritual
strength
get
after
the
very
least
of
them
and
put
them
to
death
give
them
no
place
if
one
single
word
of
lightness
or
of
impatience
escapes
your
lips
go
in
earnest
prayer
asking
god
to
make
you
a
conqueror
seek
to
have
your
life
wholly
free
from
imperfections
and
you
will
daily
advance
in
the
divine
life
life
is
full
of
peace
and
pleasure
when
we
saved
by
grace
sweetest
joys
overflow
the
measure
when
we
saved
by
grace
gifts
from
heaven
fall
in
cheering
dark
and
lonely
hours
by
our
pathway
bloom
sweet
when
we
saved
by
grace
in
sorrow
there
are
blessings
when
we
saved
by
grace
chastening
rods
are
fond
carressings
when
we
saved
by
grace
far
away
are
driven
life
flows
on
so
sweet
and
even
round
us
beams
the
light
of
heaven
when
we
saved
by
grace
all
around
is
wondrous
beauty
when
we
saved
by
grace
there
is
joy
in
every
duty
when
we
saved
by
grace
hope
is
ever
sweetly
singing
in
our
souls
are
ringing
guardian
angels
round
us
winging
when
we
saved
by
grace
we
must
every
day
be
growing
when
we
saved
by
grace
progress
in
divine
life
making
when
we
saved
by
grace
upward
upward
nearer
heaven
life
more
peaceful
and
more
even
fuller
light
upon
us
beaming
when
we
growing
in
grace
you
will
i
hope
pardon
the
writer
if
he
repeats
too
much
repetition
is
sometimes
needed
that
a
truth
may
be
enforced
sometimes
line
upon
line
is
needful
what
in
its
true
sense
is
a
holy
life
it
is
the
life
of
jesus
his
whole
manner
of
life
was
truly
holy
his
life
is
the
ideal
life
if
we
would
live
holy
we
must
live
as
he
lived
the
artist
has
his
ideal
before
him
and
with
touches
of
the
brush
here
and
there
upon
his
canvas
he
forms
an
exact
image
of
the
ideal
the
life
of
jesus
is
what
we
are
to
imitate
he
sets
the
example
of
holy
living
and
calls
us
to
the
same
holy
life
as
he
which
hath
called
you
is
holy
so
be
ye
holy
in
all
manner
of
conversation
i
pet
this
text
has
a
better
rendering
in
the
revised
version
like
as
he
which
called
you
is
holy
be
ye
yourselves
also
holy
in
all
manner
of
living
as
christians
we
are
god
offspring
and
as
such
are
like
him
holiness
in
the
life
of
jesus
is
found
not
only
in
the
great
miracles
that
he
performed
but
also
in
the
lesser
happenings
of
his
life
the
restoring
of
life
to
the
dead
is
no
more
beautifully
holy
than
the
laying
of
his
hands
upon
the
heads
of
children
and
blessing
them
his
memorable
sermon
on
the
mount
no
more
portrays
the
loveliness
of
his
character
than
does
his
conversation
with
the
woman
by
the
wayside
well
it
is
the
little
things
in
life
if
attended
to
and
kept
in
the
meekness
and
the
solemnity
of
the
spirit
of
christ
that
make
life
truly
beautiful
and
holy
it
is
not
the
eloquent
sermon
that
makes
a
life
so
sublime
but
it
is
the
tender
smile
the
kind
word
the
gentle
look
given
to
all
it
is
the
patient
manner
in
which
all
the
little
trying
and
provoking
things
of
life
are
met
you
may
preach
or
write
ever
so
forcibly
and
eloquently
and
bring
out
the
sublime
truths
of
the
bible
in
great
beauty
but
if
in
the
privacy
of
your
own
home
there
are
little
frettings
a
little
peevishness
a
little
crossness
a
little
levity
a
little
selfishness
a
little
distrust
your
life
is
not
as
truly
holy
as
it
should
be
if
you
desire
god
holy
image
to
be
stamped
upon
your
soul
your
countenance
and
your
life
you
must
carefully
avoid
the
little
sprigs
of
lightness
the
little
bits
of
sloth
and
indolence
touches
of
forwardness
rudeness
selfishness
etc
pure
words
belong
to
a
holy
life
you
should
use
the
very
choicest
words
language
that
is
free
from
vulgarity
slang
and
the
spirit
of
the
world
untidiness
uncleanness
carelessness
and
shabbiness
are
not
at
all
beautiful
ornaments
in
a
holy
life
but
quietness
modesty
and
reticence
are
gems
that
sparkle
in
a
holy
life
like
diamonds
set
in
a
band
of
gold
give
attention
to
your
words
your
thoughts
your
tone
of
voice
your
feelings
to
little
acts
of
benevolence
the
practise
of
of
promptness
of
method
and
order
these
are
auxilaries
of
holy
living
are
there
not
many
little
things
in
your
home
life
that
you
can
improve
upon
seek
god
for
help
and
be
truly
holy
lukewarmness
a
lukewarm
life
is
a
displeasure
to
god
he
would
have
us
to
be
fervent
in
spirit
god
is
pleased
with
us
when
we
are
lively
stones
but
not
when
we
are
formal
and
lukewarm
a
lukewarm
state
is
a
dangerous
state
one
very
dangerous
thing
about
it
is
that
usually
when
a
person
is
lukewarm
he
is
unaware
that
he
is
lukewarm
if
a
man
is
sick
and
does
not
know
that
he
is
sick
he
is
in
great
danger
of
his
life
because
he
is
not
at
all
likely
to
take
the
proper
care
of
himself
so
the
man
who
is
cold
and
formal
but
thinks
he
is
spiritual
and
full
of
love
is
not
at
all
likely
to
do
anything
for
the
improvement
of
his
spiritual
condition
he
is
very
much
like
the
irishman
turtle
i
hesitate
to
relate
anything
so
amusing
but
it
so
well
illustrates
the
state
of
the
lukewarm
professor
that
i
think
i
am
justifiable
some
irishmen
had
caught
a
large
turtle
and
cut
off
his
head
then
they
waited
for
him
to
die
but
the
turtle
scrambled
about
for
some
hours
desiring
an
explanation
of
such
a
phenomenon
they
accosted
an
irishman
who
was
passing
by
after
watching
the
turtle
for
a
moment
he
remarked
he
is
dead
but
he
does
know
it
this
is
the
condition
of
the
lukewarm
professors
they
are
spiritually
dead
but
are
not
aware
of
it
the
professors
of
christianity
at
laodicea
were
lukewarm
but
they
thought
themselves
rich
and
increased
with
goods
and
in
need
of
nothing
diseases
of
the
human
body
are
attended
with
certain
feelings
and
symptoms
by
which
the
physician
can
tell
the
nature
of
the
affection
in
a
particular
case
the
diseases
of
the
human
soul
are
also
attended
with
certain
symptoms
by
which
the
nature
of
the
malady
in
a
given
case
may
be
known
i
will
now
tell
you
of
a
few
of
the
symptoms
of
lukewarmness
so
you
may
know
whether
such
is
your
state
first
a
kind
of
doubtful
or
uncertain
feeling
as
to
whether
you
are
right
with
god
together
with
an
unwillingness
to
examine
yourself
closely
for
fear
you
are
wanting
being
filled
with
the
spirit
gives
us
fulness
of
assurance
second
if
when
you
testify
to
being
saved
sanctified
and
ready
for
the
coming
of
jesus
your
heart
fails
to
say
amen
and
you
wish
down
in
your
soul
you
had
a
little
better
assurance
that
what
your
lips
say
were
true
you
are
not
as
spiritual
as
you
should
be
when
we
are
filled
with
the
spirit
our
souls
are
assured
and
satisfied
third
going
along
day
after
day
in
the
same
routine
of
life
taking
it
for
granted
that
you
are
at
the
work
the
lord
wants
you
to
do
and
not
earnestly
seeking
to
i
know
his
will
those
who
are
spiritual
can
not
be
contented
without
a
definite
knowledge
of
the
will
of
god
if
you
are
going
along
without
any
real
and
positive
knowledge
of
the
will
of
god
and
are
not
seeking
to
know
it
surely
you
are
lukewarm
fourth
if
when
your
routine
of
life
is
in
some
way
interrupted
you
are
dissatisfied
and
complain
if
you
do
not
enjoy
being
moved
out
of
your
old
channel
but
you
wish
to
be
let
alone
it
is
evident
that
you
have
chosen
your
own
way
and
that
god
is
not
ordering
your
steps
fifth
if
when
you
are
called
to
the
assistance
of
a
neighbor
or
the
sick
or
even
an
enemy
you
find
a
reluctancy
to
go
and
an
often
returning
of
your
own
mind
to
your
own
concerns
and
a
desire
to
hurry
back
to
them
you
are
it
appears
looking
upon
your
own
things
and
not
on
the
things
of
others
the
bible
tells
us
to
look
upon
the
things
of
others
if
you
see
your
own
needs
and
see
and
care
but
little
about
the
things
of
others
you
are
selfish
those
who
are
spiritual
have
time
to
help
others
and
do
it
willingly
sixth
if
when
called
upon
to
go
to
the
assistance
of
some
unfortunate
one
and
you
can
not
possibly
go
if
you
do
not
have
a
deep
and
if
you
do
not
ofttimes
during
the
day
think
of
the
poor
unfortunate
man
and
be
pained
at
heart
because
of
your
inability
to
help
him
you
must
be
more
concerned
about
yourself
than
about
others
you
look
on
your
own
things
and
do
not
see
nor
feel
the
needs
of
others
if
such
is
true
in
you
you
are
in
a
lukewarm
state
seventh
if
you
were
to
be
asked
whether
you
are
doing
the
work
you
are
now
doing
solely
and
purposely
for
the
glory
of
god
and
you
should
be
obliged
to
answer
that
you
had
taken
no
particular
thought
about
it
but
supposed
it
mattered
little
to
the
lord
just
so
you
were
doing
something
this
would
surely
show
neglect
indifference
lukewarmness
eighth
if
you
are
indifferent
and
unconcerned
about
making
spiritual
progress
if
you
are
not
desiring
and
earnestly
seeking
for
more
of
god
if
you
are
not
earnestly
striving
to
be
more
meek
and
humble
to
be
more
kind
and
patient
if
you
are
carelessly
tolerating
acts
of
selfishness
of
impatience
unkindness
harshness
and
lightness
you
are
certainly
lukewarm
ninth
neglect
to
read
the
bible
and
to
pray
in
secret
greater
fervency
in
public
prayer
than
in
secret
prayer
more
outward
manifestation
than
real
inward
piety
testifying
or
preaching
beyond
the
true
standard
of
living
these
too
are
evidences
of
lukewarmness
a
man
may
become
enthusiastic
in
prayer
testimony
or
sermon
and
think
he
is
making
great
advancement
but
if
he
does
not
live
up
to
every
word
he
speaks
he
is
losing
instead
of
gaining
because
he
is
not
walking
in
light
lukewarmness
is
very
loathsome
to
god
it
reproaches
him
to
make
no
profession
of
love
to
god
at
all
is
not
such
a
reproach
to
him
as
to
profess
love
and
be
lukewarm
god
wants
all
your
heart
if
he
can
not
have
it
all
he
will
have
none
he
desires
warm
fervent
love
to
love
him
only
partially
and
not
supremely
makes
it
appear
as
if
he
were
worthy
of
only
love
it
makes
other
things
equal
with
god
after
the
physician
learns
the
symptoms
and
pronounces
the
disease
he
then
prescribes
the
remedy
thank
god
there
is
an
unfailing
remedy
for
lukewarmness
of
course
an
ounce
of
prevention
is
worth
a
pound
of
cure
repent
and
do
the
first
works
come
to
god
and
buy
of
him
gold
tried
in
the
fire
exercise
yourself
in
spiritual
things
if
there
yet
be
any
love
in
your
heart
shake
off
everything
that
is
stupefying
press
your
way
through
to
god
in
spite
of
dryness
and
deadness
stir
up
your
soul
give
yourself
to
deep
meditation
upon
the
great
love
of
god
to
you
pray
in
fervency
and
faith
consecrate
to
the
whole
will
of
god
if
your
case
is
not
hopeless
and
it
is
not
this
will
effect
a
cure
steadfastness
therefore
my
beloved
brethren
be
ye
steadfast
unmovable
always
abounding
in
the
work
of
the
lord
cor
steadfastness
is
an
essential
principle
in
christian
character
there
can
be
no
success
nor
prosperity
in
the
christian
life
when
this
principle
is
wanting
the
psalmist
said
my
heart
is
fixed
trusting
in
the
lord
this
is
true
steadfastness
it
is
cleaving
to
god
let
the
storms
rage
as
they
may
it
is
resting
and
abiding
in
jesus
though
the
trials
of
life
may
be
the
severest
possible
it
is
a
firm
fixed
settled
decision
to
abide
in
doctrines
of
the
bible
it
is
to
rest
confidingly
upon
the
teaching
and
promises
of
the
holy
scriptures
just
as
a
man
lies
confidently
down
to
rest
upon
his
bed
so
a
christian
in
his
steadfastness
rests
confidingly
rests
without
fear
upon
the
word
of
god
through
jesus
christ
christians
are
made
partakers
of
the
divine
nature
they
receive
the
imprint
of
divine
character
in
their
souls
among
the
different
principles
in
the
character
of
god
is
found
steadfastness
when
god
delivered
daniel
from
the
lions
darius
the
king
said
i
make
a
decree
that
in
every
dominion
of
my
kingdom
men
tremble
and
fear
before
the
god
of
daniel
for
he
is
the
living
god
and
steadfast
forever
dan
just
as
christian
fortitude
is
noble
manly
and
pleasing
to
god
so
a
lack
of
steadfastness
is
ignoble
unmanly
and
highly
displeasing
to
god
some
it
may
be
many
are
led
by
their
feelings
we
as
the
children
of
god
are
to
be
led
by
the
spirit
of
god
but
not
all
fully
understand
what
is
meant
by
being
led
by
the
spirit
i
would
rather
be
led
by
a
sense
of
duty
than
by
my
feelings
i
do
not
understand
that
in
order
to
be
led
by
the
spirit
we
need
always
to
have
a
strong
inward
impression
or
almost
audible
voice
speaking
to
us
the
spirit
of
god
has
illuminated
the
word
and
enlightened
your
mind
to
know
what
is
your
christian
duty
hence
when
you
go
forward
and
discharge
your
duties
faithfully
you
are
truly
being
led
by
the
spirit
you
know
it
to
be
your
duty
to
help
the
poor
to
support
the
weak
to
comfort
the
sorrowful
to
attend
religious
services
to
witness
for
jesus
to
study
the
scriptures
to
pray
and
diligently
to
follow
every
good
work
you
may
sometimes
feel
a
strong
impression
to
pray
but
you
do
not
need
to
have
this
feeling
always
in
order
to
be
duty
to
pray
it
is
your
duty
to
pray
to
give
of
your
means
oftentimes
just
as
much
when
you
do
not
feel
impressed
to
do
so
as
when
you
have
strong
inward
impressions
you
do
not
need
to
wait
for
such
impressions
before
you
act
for
a
knowledge
of
your
duty
makes
you
responsible
a
man
can
have
no
true
steadfastness
who
is
influenced
by
his
emotions
or
impressions
the
man
who
is
steadfast
unmovable
in
the
word
goes
forward
to
a
discharge
of
his
known
duties
no
matter
what
his
feelings
may
be
whatever
may
be
his
impressions
to
do
a
certain
thing
if
it
is
not
consistent
with
the
word
and
the
spirit
and
his
knowledge
of
right
he
persistently
refuses
to
obey
how
the
true
principle
of
steadfastness
abides
in
the
will
of
god
and
the
doctrines
of
christ
is
demonstrated
in
the
teachings
of
barnabas
to
the
church
at
antioch
there
was
some
contention
in
the
church
over
circumcision
and
heavy
persecutions
from
without
and
many
were
being
moved
from
the
true
faith
barnabas
exhorted
that
with
purpose
of
heart
they
cleave
to
the
lord
steadfastness
is
a
firm
fixed
purpose
of
the
heart
to
cleave
unto
god
to
attend
strictly
and
promptly
to
every
christian
duty
it
is
a
decided
unchangeable
unshaken
purpose
of
the
heart
to
obey
implicitly
the
teachings
of
the
savior
regardless
of
the
feelings
you
will
find
that
if
you
attend
to
every
christian
duty
you
will
often
have
to
go
contrary
to
your
feelings
how
often
the
enemy
of
your
soul
will
if
he
can
cast
indifferent
feelings
over
you
concerning
prayer
that
is
the
time
to
show
your
christian
fortitude
and
steadfastness
it
is
weakness
and
laziness
to
neglect
prayer
simply
because
we
do
not
feel
inclined
to
pray
to
yield
to
indifferent
feelings
is
to
encourage
them
and
they
will
grow
stronger
and
stronger
so
that
we
shall
feel
less
and
less
inclined
to
pray
the
more
we
pray
the
more
prayerful
we
feel
likewise
the
less
we
pray
the
less
prayerful
we
feel
when
we
have
yielded
to
indifferent
feelings
for
sometime
and
have
sadly
neglected
prayer
we
have
a
hard
struggle
to
get
through
to
the
glorious
light
and
victory
and
sweetness
but
you
must
get
out
where
the
blessings
fall
you
must
get
where
you
have
sweet
tastes
of
love
and
the
satisfying
blessings
of
the
presence
of
god
you
must
be
courageous
manly
and
decided
the
way
to
enjoy
serving
god
and
doing
our
full
christian
duty
is
always
to
do
our
duty
and
especially
at
those
times
when
doing
it
seems
to
be
the
least
enjoyable
steadfastly
resist
satan
and
every
indifferent
feeling
and
do
your
duty
at
any
cost
remember
it
is
not
he
that
feels
to
do
good
and
doeth
it
not
but
he
that
knoweth
to
do
good
and
doeth
it
not
to
him
it
is
sin
how
to
understand
god
will
in
order
to
do
god
will
we
must
first
know
his
will
in
order
to
have
real
satisfaction
rest
and
contentment
in
the
christian
life
and
there
is
no
true
rest
outside
the
christian
life
we
must
have
the
full
assurance
that
we
are
doing
the
will
of
god
the
soul
that
loves
god
can
not
be
satisfied
with
anything
less
than
this
as
long
as
there
is
a
doubt
there
can
not
be
perfect
contentment
we
must
have
a
perfect
knowledge
of
god
will
concerning
us
or
else
we
shall
not
fully
know
we
are
doing
his
will
many
are
saying
i
would
gladly
do
god
will
if
i
only
knew
what
was
his
will
such
ones
have
not
reached
that
nearness
to
god
that
they
should
there
should
always
be
a
clear
and
definite
understanding
between
god
and
his
children
my
sheep
jesus
says
hear
my
voice
and
we
know
that
god
hears
the
voice
of
his
children
we
can
talk
to
god
and
god
to
us
consequently
there
can
be
understanding
between
us
you
can
live
close
enough
to
god
to
know
his
will
not
merely
to
suppose
his
will
or
take
it
for
granted
but
to
know
it
because
he
told
you
a
man
employees
may
suppose
they
are
doing
what
he
wants
them
to
do
but
this
does
not
give
them
full
assurance
it
is
only
when
they
have
been
in
his
presence
and
heard
him
express
his
will
that
they
know
they
are
doing
it
you
can
know
god
will
you
need
not
spend
one
day
without
knowing
you
are
in
his
order
the
scripture
says
wherefore
be
ye
not
unwise
but
understanding
what
the
will
of
the
lord
is
eph
in
the
verses
preceding
this
one
we
are
told
to
walk
circumspectly
and
to
redeem
the
time
we
need
to
know
god
will
that
we
may
use
every
opportunity
to
the
greatest
advantage
to
pass
along
day
after
day
without
a
definite
knowledge
of
being
in
the
will
of
god
or
without
taking
much
thought
about
it
or
earnestly
seeking
to
know
it
is
living
on
entirely
too
low
a
spiritual
plane
god
wants
you
to
come
up
higher
high
enough
and
close
enough
to
know
his
will
has
not
god
purchased
you
you
are
his
servant
his
bondslave
you
are
to
do
everything
you
do
for
him
he
who
has
men
in
his
employ
expects
them
to
do
his
will
they
do
not
go
out
a
single
day
ignorant
of
his
will
they
do
not
always
wait
to
be
told
what
to
do
but
they
make
inquiry
with
many
there
may
not
be
enough
earnest
seeking
after
god
to
know
his
will
in
order
to
know
god
will
there
must
be
a
perfect
consecration
to
god
the
soul
must
lay
down
her
own
will
and
present
herself
before
god
as
much
as
to
say
i
give
up
my
way
and
will
forever
to
be
thine
and
thine
alone
to
love
thee
and
serve
thee
to
do
thy
whole
will
now
and
forever
there
must
be
humility
before
god
a
deep
inner
consciousness
of
your
nothingness
and
your
inability
to
accomplish
anything
in
life
of
yourself
the
meek
he
will
guide
in
judgment
we
must
be
meek
and
humble
before
the
lord
and
confess
that
we
are
dependent
on
him
and
that
life
will
be
an
utter
failure
unless
he
wills
and
guides
and
plans
and
works
in
us
and
with
us
and
for
us
there
must
be
great
love
to
god
and
an
earnest
desire
to
know
his
will
without
strong
desire
to
know
god
will
you
can
never
learn
it
it
is
those
who
desire
that
obtain
answers
to
their
prayers
and
that
desire
must
be
really
great
you
must
seek
to
know
where
there
is
great
desire
there
will
be
earnest
seeking
but
there
will
not
be
earnest
seeking
without
the
fervent
desire
the
desire
must
be
so
intense
that
you
feel
as
if
you
must
know
you
must
feel
that
you
can
not
get
along
in
life
without
knowing
god
will
you
can
not
be
of
any
service
to
him
without
having
knowledge
of
his
will
you
must
also
have
faith
when
you
ask
god
to
teach
you
his
will
you
must
believe
he
will
do
it
and
he
will
do
it
when
he
begins
to
unfold
his
will
you
must
move
in
his
order
without
doubting
or
questioning
he
will
guide
you
and
direct
your
every
step
and
you
can
know
that
you
are
doing
the
very
thing
god
wants
you
to
do
bless
his
name
such
a
life
is
heaven
here
a
view
of
jesus
let
us
take
a
look
at
jesus
let
us
pray
that
the
holy
spirit
may
unveil
him
and
present
him
to
us
clearly
now
we
see
him
we
see
him
as
our
all
and
as
in
all
can
you
see
him
thus
is
he
everything
to
you
and
is
he
in
everything
that
comes
to
you
let
us
take
a
view
of
jesus
through
two
texts
of
scripture
first
and
hath
put
all
things
under
his
feet
eph
we
see
him
as
our
protector
christ
has
conquered
all
and
god
has
put
all
things
under
his
son
feet
in
all
the
world
there
is
no
evil
thing
that
can
harm
the
child
of
god
jesus
cares
for
his
children
how
safe
we
feel
he
is
our
refuge
our
strong
tower
our
buckler
and
our
shield
discouragements
doubts
fears
disease
satan
and
all
that
would
antagonize
us
are
under
his
feet
and
so
can
never
do
us
harm
second
the
father
loveth
the
son
and
hath
given
all
things
into
his
hand
every
good
thing
is
in
the
hand
of
jesus
he
stands
ready
to
give
them
to
his
children
there
is
not
a
need
you
can
ever
have
but
jesus
has
in
his
hand
something
with
which
to
supply
that
need
his
loving
hand
is
extended
to
you
it
contains
something
that
will
meet
all
your
needs
in
life
praise
the
lord
nothing
can
harm
us
for
every
harmful
and
harming
thing
is
beneath
the
feet
of
our
lord
so
we
need
not
fear
we
can
never
fail
to
have
all
our
needs
supplied
for
jesus
stands
with
outstretched
hand
to
give
just
what
we
need
just
when
we
need
it
do
you
see
jesus
as
such
open
your
eyes
wide
look
and
live
and
be
happy
and
free
devotion
to
god
devotion
to
god
implies
ardent
affection
for
him
a
yielding
of
the
heart
to
him
with
reverence
faith
and
piety
in
every
act
particularly
in
prayer
and
meditation
we
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
true
meaning
of
devotion
from
what
is
said
of
the
centurion
of
the
italian
band
he
was
termed
a
devout
man
because
he
feared
god
gave
much
alms
to
the
people
and
prayed
to
god
always
see
acts
this
is
the
essence
of
true
devotion
he
loved
god
without
which
there
can
be
no
devotion
the
more
we
love
an
object
the
more
devoted
to
it
we
are
devotion
is
therefore
love
manifested
at
the
feet
of
jesus
stood
a
woman
weeping
and
washing
his
feet
with
her
tears
and
wiping
them
with
the
hairs
of
her
head
and
kissing
them
is
not
this
a
picture
of
devotion
it
is
love
and
devotion
expressed
in
action
jesus
said
she
loved
much
the
secret
of
devotion
is
loving
i
much
every
devoted
christian
desires
to
be
more
devoted
to
his
god
i
am
glad
we
can
be
it
is
pleasant
to
feel
in
our
hearts
an
ardent
desire
to
love
god
more
a
fond
mother
clasps
her
babe
to
her
bosom
she
loves
it
and
her
heart
is
happy
in
that
love
but
she
feels
she
can
not
love
it
enough
she
longs
to
love
it
more
her
heart
yearns
to
love
it
more
though
she
loves
it
from
the
fulness
of
her
soul
this
longing
to
love
increases
our
capacity
to
love
by
being
filled
with
air
some
vessels
are
made
to
expand
unless
filled
to
their
utmost
capacity
they
would
not
become
more
extended
to
the
extent
that
the
heart
is
filled
with
the
love
of
god
man
is
happy
to
desire
to
be
more
devotional
is
not
an
evidence
of
lack
of
devotion
but
on
the
contrary
an
evidence
of
devotion
those
who
are
the
least
devotional
have
the
least
desire
to
be
more
devotional
the
heart
that
is
fullest
of
love
is
happiest
and
although
it
is
happy
and
satisfied
yet
it
longs
to
move
oh
how
we
long
to
clasp
our
arms
more
tightly
about
him
how
we
long
to
have
him
clasp
his
arms
more
tightly
about
us
how
we
long
to
nestle
more
fondly
and
lovingly
on
his
bosom
what
rapture
to
our
souls
to
receive
of
his
caresses
and
hear
his
tender
words
to
the
soul
in
the
ecstasy
of
its
heavenly
love
the
world
with
its
pleasures
has
vanished
away
like
a
morning
vapor
it
is
not
understood
by
all
how
and
why
we
should
have
a
desire
to
possess
more
of
that
of
which
we
are
already
full
it
is
the
desire
for
development
it
is
an
innate
desire
it
is
a
principle
planted
in
our
constitution
under
grace
let
me
repeat
what
i
have
said
elsewhere
every
living
thing
consciously
or
unconsciously
struggles
to
conform
to
type
when
the
little
plant
bursts
through
the
ground
it
enters
the
race
in
conforming
to
the
type
that
it
carries
in
its
bosom
thus
in
the
heart
of
the
acorn
is
a
miniature
the
little
chick
carries
within
it
an
image
of
the
mother
bird
to
which
it
will
naturally
though
unconsciously
conform
in
the
natural
world
when
things
reach
the
highest
point
of
development
they
begin
to
decay
or
deteriorate
but
this
is
not
true
in
the
spiritual
world
never
in
this
life
and
possibly
never
in
that
life
which
is
to
come
shall
we
reach
the
fulness
of
the
type
or
in
other
words
the
highest
point
of
development
as
the
acorn
or
the
little
chick
bears
in
its
nature
an
image
of
the
parent
so
the
christian
bears
in
his
soul
the
image
of
god
this
is
the
image
to
which
he
is
to
conform
day
after
day
he
can
grow
in
grace
day
after
day
the
beautiful
graces
of
the
spirit
can
become
more
beautiful
and
the
exterior
life
be
more
perceptibly
stamped
with
the
holy
image
of
god
there
must
be
progress
or
there
will
be
regress
when
a
ball
that
has
been
thrown
upward
ceases
to
ascend
it
begins
to
descend
when
the
fulness
of
the
type
is
reached
then
begins
the
retrogression
this
is
none
the
less
true
of
spiritual
things
the
reason
why
there
need
be
no
declension
in
love
is
because
the
highest
point
of
development
is
never
attained
for
illustration
let
us
set
a
little
child
in
our
midst
as
a
child
it
is
perfect
all
its
organs
are
in
proper
place
and
are
properly
performing
their
functions
it
is
a
perfect
image
of
the
type
of
man
into
which
it
will
grow
that
child
nature
tends
toward
and
the
child
longs
to
be
a
man
the
child
innate
desire
for
development
does
not
make
it
discontented
as
long
as
its
craving
for
growth
is
gratified
in
this
we
behold
the
goodness
and
the
wisdom
of
the
creator
that
the
child
may
be
happy
it
is
so
constituted
that
it
satisfactorily
meets
all
the
requirements
of
the
law
of
development
the
child
is
thus
kept
in
a
state
of
contentment
did
it
seek
to
fulfil
the
law
of
growth
contrary
to
its
nature
to
become
a
man
would
be
an
irksome
task
it
is
a
delight
to
the
child
to
eat
to
play
to
sleep
and
these
things
producing
growth
meet
the
demands
of
its
nature
there
is
implanted
in
it
both
a
desire
to
grow
and
a
relish
for
the
things
necessary
to
its
growth
thus
the
entire
process
of
development
is
a
delight
in
fact
there
will
be
no
delight
or
enjoyment
unless
there
be
development
true
a
child
does
not
eat
and
play
for
the
express
purpose
of
growing
indeed
it
may
take
no
thought
about
growing
but
there
is
in
the
nature
of
the
child
when
in
health
a
demand
for
growth
when
the
child
is
in
ill
health
the
growth
ceases
consequently
there
is
no
demand
for
development
and
it
loses
relish
for
the
things
that
go
to
meet
that
demand
this
very
beautifully
illustrates
christian
development
which
includes
becoming
more
devotional
you
desire
to
be
more
devotional
such
a
desire
is
legitimate
the
nature
of
every
sanctified
soul
craves
development
the
soul
is
not
dissatisfied
any
more
than
the
growing
child
as
that
developing
life
in
the
child
moves
it
to
seek
for
the
things
that
produce
development
so
the
life
of
god
in
the
sanctified
soul
moves
it
to
seek
for
the
things
that
will
unfold
and
amplify
that
life
if
ye
be
risen
have
life
with
christ
seek
those
things
which
are
above
those
things
coming
into
our
soul
daily
will
unfold
us
more
and
more
into
an
heavenly
life
they
are
food
to
the
sanctified
soul
they
keep
the
soul
satisfied
because
they
are
the
means
provided
by
a
loving
providence
for
the
constant
healthful
growth
of
our
spiritual
natures
herein
only
is
true
god
gives
us
a
relish
for
the
very
things
that
go
to
fulfil
the
demands
of
our
christian
nature
prayer
meditation
reading
the
bible
trust
and
resting
in
the
lord
promote
increase
in
him
how
delightful
is
prayer
to
the
soul
that
is
healthful
and
growing
and
the
word
of
god
is
sweeter
than
honey
where
there
is
a
demand
in
the
soul
for
these
things
how
delightful
it
is
to
engage
in
them
do
you
behold
the
beauty
and
the
wisdom
here
god
implants
a
desire
in
the
soul
for
spiritual
development
and
at
the
same
time
implants
a
relish
for
the
things
necessary
for
such
development
bless
his
name
understand
me
please
this
desire
is
not
a
restless
longing
an
aching
void
as
is
found
in
an
unregenerate
heart
or
in
a
soul
in
spiritual
decline
but
it
is
the
delightful
struggling
of
a
soul
bearing
the
likeness
of
god
to
conform
to
the
natural
law
of
development
pent
up
within
its
bosom
what
is
it
in
the
nature
of
the
oak
that
causes
it
to
send
its
root
down
into
the
soil
and
to
drink
up
of
its
substance
what
is
it
in
the
nature
of
the
child
that
causes
it
so
eagerly
to
eat
and
play
it
is
the
demand
in
their
nature
for
growth
or
that
innate
struggle
to
conform
to
type
manhood
is
sleeping
in
the
child
bosom
and
it
wrestles
and
struggles
to
rise
to
the
fulness
of
that
image
what
causes
the
christian
heart
to
long
to
root
deeper
into
god
that
makes
the
soul
seek
his
embrace
it
is
that
instinctive
struggle
to
conform
to
god
glorious
image
the
entire
process
of
development
is
delightful
whenever
the
natural
tendency
toward
growth
ceases
the
soul
is
in
an
abnormal
state
and
loses
relish
for
the
things
necessary
to
growth
christian
see
to
it
that
you
keep
in
your
heart
a
desire
a
longing
a
panting
or
if
you
would
rather
i
will
say
a
demand
in
your
spiritual
being
to
be
more
devotional
to
god
and
meet
that
demand
by
resting
by
faith
in
him
by
prayer
by
meditation
by
service
do
this
and
you
will
become
more
devotional
but
i
love
the
word
desire
desire
in
the
soul
for
spiritual
things
is
appetite
satisfying
this
desire
is
a
pleasure
never
were
any
viands
so
sweet
to
the
physical
sense
of
taste
as
that
food
to
our
soul
which
helps
us
be
more
devotional
desire
is
a
bible
term
as
babes
i
desire
the
sincere
milk
of
the
word
that
ye
may
grow
thereby
before
concluding
this
chapter
i
will
call
your
attention
to
one
way
of
becoming
more
devotional
being
active
in
service
desire
must
be
gratified
or
it
will
die
likewise
motive
must
find
expression
in
action
or
it
will
die
you
have
a
desire
for
prayer
then
grant
that
desire
by
actually
praying
or
you
will
lose
the
desire
an
appetite
once
lost
is
difficult
to
regain
you
may
have
in
your
soul
a
pure
motive
then
carry
it
into
action
do
something
for
god
and
you
will
become
more
devotional
to
god
not
that
devotion
comes
by
works
to
begin
with
any
more
than
grace
but
we
do
become
more
devotional
by
doing
just
as
we
grow
stronger
physically
by
exercise
follow
out
every
inclination
to
do
good
as
far
as
you
can
and
you
will
become
more
devotional
to
your
god
god
loves
to
have
you
devoted
to
him
and
he
longs
to
have
you
more
devoted
it
is
astonishing
nevertheless
god
has
intense
desire
to
be
prayed
to
and
great
love
for
communion
with
our
hearts
he
says
my
son
give
me
thine
heart
what
does
he
want
with
man
heart
he
wants
to
put
his
love
in
it
so
he
can
be
loved
by
it
and
hold
communion
with
it
the
prayer
of
the
upright
is
his
delight
oh
that
there
are
so
few
hearts
that
love
god
jesus
wept
over
jerusalem
because
they
would
not
come
to
him
but
why
does
he
so
intensely
yearn
for
the
prayers
and
devotions
of
our
hearts
because
it
is
another
young
life
struggling
to
conform
to
the
image
in
which
it
was
created
it
is
another
soul
which
has
been
won
for
god
and
in
which
he
has
his
throne
o
god
take
our
hearts
and
compress
within
them
that
pure
love
from
thy
own
heart
that
will
cause
us
to
pray
o
god
enlarge
our
hearts
god
would
even
pain
our
hearts
with
the
fulness
of
his
love
until
we
find
no
ease
except
in
expansion
the
golden
rule
of
life
and
as
ye
would
that
men
should
do
to
you
do
ye
also
to
them
like
wise
luke
this
is
a
good
rule
for
living
it
is
known
throughout
the
christian
world
as
the
golden
rule
it
has
great
depths
it
contains
more
no
doubt
than
any
of
us
comprehend
but
let
us
study
it
for
a
moment
we
might
divide
it
into
two
rules
first
do
good
to
all
second
do
harm
to
none
we
would
that
all
men
should
do
us
good
and
we
would
that
none
should
do
us
harm
but
if
we
would
see
the
greater
depths
of
this
rule
we
must
look
beyond
the
physical
man
to
do
good
to
all
and
harm
to
none
in
a
bodily
or
physical
sense
is
indeed
good
but
to
do
good
to
all
and
harm
to
none
in
a
moral
sense
is
much
better
we
should
do
all
we
can
to
help
others
in
a
moral
sense
is
not
this
what
we
would
have
all
men
do
to
us
we
should
do
harm
to
none
in
a
moral
sense
because
we
would
have
none
do
us
harm
this
necessitates
living
a
very
holy
life
there
are
two
ways
in
which
we
may
do
good
to
men
morally
first
by
strengthening
the
good
that
is
in
them
second
by
suppressing
and
helping
them
to
overcome
any
evil
or
fault
that
may
be
in
them
likewise
there
are
two
ways
in
which
we
may
do
harm
to
men
morally
first
by
strengthening
and
encouraging
the
evil
and
fault
that
may
be
in
them
second
by
suppressing
and
destroying
the
good
that
may
be
in
them
we
are
all
creatures
of
influence
we
are
being
influenced
and
we
are
having
an
influence
there
never
was
a
human
life
but
that
had
some
influence
over
some
other
human
life
we
influence
more
by
example
than
by
words
if
we
say
one
thing
and
act
another
we
shall
find
our
actions
speaking
more
loudly
than
our
words
if
we
love
god
with
all
our
hearts
that
love
will
influence
another
to
love
him
never
was
love
lost
the
love
you
have
o
child
of
god
will
find
its
way
into
some
other
life
sometime
somewhere
the
more
of
god
love
is
beaming
out
of
our
heart
and
life
the
greater
will
be
our
influence
upon
others
then
may
we
love
him
with
all
the
heart
we
should
be
filled
with
the
spirit
if
we
are
spiritual
we
cause
those
we
converse
with
to
desire
to
be
more
spiritual
we
should
be
full
of
faith
that
our
strong
faith
may
help
others
to
have
more
faith
we
should
like
for
others
to
be
such
an
example
to
us
and
as
we
would
that
men
should
do
to
us
let
us
do
to
them
it
is
a
very
great
source
of
regret
indeed
to
be
so
destitute
of
love
faith
and
spirituality
that
we
discourage
and
dampen
the
ardor
of
those
into
whose
presence
we
may
be
for
a
time
be
your
very
best
for
god
every
day
of
your
life
and
wield
a
holy
influence
over
the
hearts
of
men
the
very
greatest
benefit
we
can
be
to
man
and
the
highest
homage
we
can
pay
to
god
is
to
be
filled
with
all
the
fulness
of
god
timeliness
in
doing
good
to
spend
well
this
one
brief
life
of
ours
we
must
be
active
in
doing
good
this
we
have
already
learned
but
not
only
should
we
be
active
in
doing
good
but
we
should
do
the
good
act
when
the
act
will
be
most
helpful
do
the
good
deed
when
the
good
deed
needs
to
be
done
the
kind
word
may
be
worth
much
and
be
greatly
helpful
to
the
fainting
soul
today
but
may
be
too
late
tomorrow
as
we
have
therefore
opportunity
let
us
do
good
unto
all
men
will
you
stop
a
moment
and
think
over
these
words
let
no
opportunity
of
doing
good
go
by
you
unimproved
to
neglect
the
present
opportunity
of
doing
good
and
then
never
be
able
to
do
it
is
a
sad
thing
of
all
sad
words
of
tongue
or
pen
the
saddest
are
these
might
have
been
why
do
you
keep
all
the
kind
thoughts
and
kind
words
for
a
man
until
he
is
dead
they
do
him
no
good
then
it
is
while
he
is
living
that
he
needs
them
he
has
burdens
heavy
to
be
borne
troubles
gather
thick
over
his
head
he
is
neglected
and
even
misrepresented
you
can
help
him
with
a
smile
or
a
few
kind
words
but
no
you
pass
him
by
now
he
is
brought
to
the
grave
as
the
cold
clods
fall
upon
his
plain
coffin
you
say
well
he
was
a
good
man
after
all
why
did
you
not
tell
him
that
when
he
was
living
it
would
have
buoyed
up
his
spirit
then
it
would
have
made
him
feel
that
life
was
not
all
in
vain
and
that
yet
he
might
do
a
little
good
but
now
he
hears
not
your
words
they
return
to
you
or
float
out
into
empty
space
a
mere
sound
the
ear
that
was
once
eager
for
them
and
the
heart
that
was
aching
for
them
is
now
cold
in
death
your
kind
cheering
words
are
too
late
to
give
him
encouragement
your
flowers
are
too
late
to
be
appreciated
once
they
would
have
brightened
his
life
but
now
his
life
is
over
once
you
could
have
chased
away
some
clouds
that
were
darkening
his
life
but
you
did
not
and
that
day
has
gone
into
eternity
as
a
day
of
darkness
you
might
have
brightened
it
this
morning
some
kind
hand
placed
a
vase
of
beautiful
flowers
upon
my
desk
as
i
write
their
fragrance
reaches
me
and
brings
me
tidings
of
some
one
kind
remembrance
it
costs
but
little
to
speak
kind
words
but
oh
ofttimes
they
are
worth
so
much
i
know
of
nothing
that
costs
so
little
to
give
that
is
so
valuable
to
receive
but
why
keep
all
the
flowers
the
kind
words
the
tender
feelings
and
thoughts
and
the
sympathetic
tears
until
the
one
to
whom
they
should
be
given
passes
away
and
then
come
and
let
them
fall
so
gently
upon
the
casket
do
you
know
of
one
who
is
weary
do
you
know
of
one
who
is
being
misrepresented
do
you
know
of
one
who
is
being
trodden
down
by
others
with
scarcely
any
one
to
speak
a
word
of
comfort
now
what
would
jesus
do
look
at
poor
lazarus
turned
away
by
the
rich
neglected
and
rejected
watched
over
by
angels
ready
to
gather
him
to
paradise
when
he
passes
beyond
the
need
of
aid
from
men
why
not
be
an
angel
and
make
a
day
of
paradise
for
him
here
let
us
do
some
while
here
in
life
the
angels
are
ministering
spirits
they
whisper
be
of
good
cheer
peace
on
earth
they
come
to
gladden
hearts
they
come
to
close
the
lions
mouths
they
come
to
open
the
prison
doors
and
break
the
iron
bands
oh
let
us
do
some
hast
thou
any
flowers
for
me
wilt
thou
kindly
let
them
be
given
ere
death
my
brow
wait
not
give
them
to
me
now
while
in
life
eventful
day
tried
and
weary
grows
the
way
when
in
dark
and
lonely
hour
give
me
then
the
cheering
hast
thou
kind
words
to
impart
words
that
lift
the
fainting
heart
speak
ere
death
hand
on
me
lay
speak
those
kind
words
now
today
kind
words
are
but
empty
breath
to
the
heart
that
still
in
death
when
life
load
is
hard
to
bear
let
me
then
the
kind
word
hear
hast
thou
sunlit
smiles
to
give
smiles
that
make
us
want
to
live
ere
i
cross
death
sullen
stream
on
me
let
those
bright
smiles
beam
smiles
their
power
to
save
can
not
penetrate
the
grave
ere
i
reach
life
ending
mile
give
to
me
the
sunlit
smile
prayer
can
stay
the
trembling
knee
if
thou
hast
but
one
for
me
let
it
offered
be
today
ere
the
fades
away
when
my
soul
transcends
the
air
i
no
more
shall
need
thy
prayer
let
now
today
thy
soul
travail
is
only
now
thy
prayers
avail
if
i
should
die
tonight
my
friends
would
call
to
mind
with
loving
thought
some
kindly
deed
the
icy
hand
had
wrought
some
gentle
word
the
frozen
lips
had
said
errands
on
which
the
willing
feet
had
sped
the
memory
of
my
selfishness
and
pride
my
hasty
words
would
all
be
put
aside
and
so
i
should
be
loved
and
mourned
tonight
the
warfare
of
a
christian
life
it
is
blessed
and
glorious
to
be
a
christian
no
other
life
is
so
beautiful
and
pure
no
other
life
is
so
tranquilly
peaceful
no
other
is
so
full
of
rest
happiness
and
satisfaction
the
christian
however
does
not
go
to
heaven
on
flowery
beds
of
ease
his
pathway
is
not
strewn
with
roses
all
the
way
there
is
now
and
then
a
thorn
it
is
not
sunshine
all
the
time
now
and
then
a
shadow
falls
to
win
heaven
he
must
fight
there
are
some
things
to
oppose
a
christian
on
his
pilgrimage
to
the
skies
these
he
must
contend
against
the
contending
against
those
things
prepares
him
for
his
blissful
home
above
all
things
work
together
for
good
to
them
that
love
god
blessings
and
hell
venom
angels
smiles
and
satan
frowns
comforts
of
grace
and
spiritual
wickedness
good
and
ill
love
and
hatred
all
work
good
to
those
who
have
union
with
god
it
is
the
battle
that
disciplines
and
makes
strong
and
brave
the
warrior
and
not
the
victory
we
are
exhorted
to
endure
hardness
as
a
good
soldier
there
are
some
things
to
endure
along
the
christian
way
james
says
blessed
is
the
man
that
endureth
temptation
temptations
are
outward
influences
acting
upon
our
natural
emotions
and
passions
to
induce
the
will
to
act
contrary
to
the
law
of
grace
to
satisfy
self
we
need
not
expect
to
be
free
from
temptations
therefore
let
us
settle
it
that
we
will
endure
them
it
is
really
a
blessed
thing
to
endure
them
you
may
think
it
would
be
a
blessed
thing
to
be
free
from
them
but
such
would
not
be
the
case
it
is
more
blessed
to
endure
them
temptations
will
never
cease
to
attack
the
soul
as
long
as
it
inhabits
this
muddy
vesture
of
decay
be
brave
o
soul
and
endure
temptations
be
brave
and
fight
the
good
fight
of
faith
do
not
faint
because
you
have
temptations
do
not
fear
because
there
are
long
and
fierce
battles
to
fight
be
strong
and
of
good
courage
it
is
a
struggle
and
it
is
also
a
victory
and
in
the
end
eternal
victory
strong
and
spiritual
sinews
are
the
result
of
resisted
temptations
it
is
not
sinful
to
be
tempted
we
never
lose
any
spirituality
by
being
tempted
it
is
the
slight
yieldings
that
cause
a
leaking
a
loss
of
grace
clear
up
the
vision
of
your
faith
a
little
and
take
a
look
at
your
beautiful
glittering
crown
of
life
it
is
not
gold
neither
crystal
do
not
look
at
it
as
such
but
see
it
a
crown
of
life
yes
you
will
be
crowned
with
eternal
life
if
you
will
but
endure
temptation
think
of
this
in
the
hour
of
thy
sore
trial
fight
on
heaven
awaits
to
reward
you
live
by
faith
live
by
faith
there
is
no
other
true
and
right
way
to
live
without
faith
it
is
impossible
to
please
god
and
of
course
the
life
that
pleases
god
is
the
only
life
that
is
perfect
we
can
please
god
we
can
walk
each
day
in
a
way
that
is
pleasing
to
him
such
a
walk
is
by
faith
not
by
sight
god
honors
faith
he
loves
to
have
his
word
believed
he
delights
to
hear
the
prayer
of
faith
it
avails
with
him
around
the
great
white
throne
in
heaven
the
angels
are
shouting
day
and
night
holy
holy
holy
lord
god
almighty
blessing
and
glory
and
wisdom
and
thanksgiving
honor
and
power
belong
to
thee
but
amid
all
this
sound
of
praise
god
hears
a
voice
and
bends
an
ear
to
listen
it
is
the
prayer
of
faith
from
the
heart
of
one
of
his
children
there
is
never
too
many
angels
singing
nor
too
many
harps
resounding
for
god
to
hear
the
voice
of
his
child
my
voice
said
the
sweet
singer
of
israel
shalt
thou
hear
in
the
morning
he
hears
the
first
faint
cry
of
his
child
even
the
unuttered
wish
of
the
heart
the
unexpressed
desire
the
faintest
breathing
of
love
he
hears
and
recognizes
as
the
voice
of
his
child
faith
will
wing
its
way
into
the
presence
of
god
it
traverses
the
universe
until
it
finds
him
and
there
brings
the
soul
to
its
rest
faith
will
guide
us
through
this
world
faith
touches
god
a
woman
came
to
jesus
and
tremblingly
reached
out
her
feeble
hand
and
touched
the
hem
of
his
garment
he
asked
who
touched
me
it
was
not
the
that
he
felt
but
the
today
we
can
touch
him
by
faith
and
by
no
other
way
though
many
angels
may
be
thronging
him
yet
the
feeblest
touch
of
faith
will
reach
him
you
may
be
one
of
the
weakest
ones
unnoticed
and
unknown
a
little
cabin
on
the
mountainside
may
be
your
home
but
your
feeblest
cry
of
faith
will
reach
the
throne
of
god
and
he
will
send
angels
to
encamp
round
about
you
and
deliver
you
i
have
faith
in
when
all
is
dark
around
you
believe
in
him
trust
him
when
you
can
not
trace
and
believe
when
you
can
not
see
never
doubt
his
word
faith
will
prevail
and
bring
you
the
desire
of
your
heart
will
you
believe
a
valuable
legacy
a
legacy
is
a
gift
that
some
one
makes
to
another
usually
something
that
one
leaves
behind
when
departing
from
this
world
for
others
to
enjoy
some
have
left
great
sums
of
money
to
others
and
to
institutions
and
these
bequests
have
been
called
valuable
legacies
i
am
now
to
tell
you
of
the
greatest
and
most
valuable
legacy
that
has
ever
been
left
to
man
it
is
a
bequest
left
not
to
one
man
but
to
all
men
it
is
not
a
legacy
of
silver
or
gold
or
diamonds
nor
of
houses
and
lands
nor
can
this
precious
gift
be
purchased
with
gold
it
is
something
jesus
gives
and
what
he
has
can
not
be
purchased
with
any
earthly
thing
i
will
read
you
what
it
is
peace
i
leave
with
you
my
peace
i
give
unto
you
these
are
the
words
that
jesus
uttered
just
before
his
departure
from
the
world
and
this
is
the
legacy
he
leaves
to
man
oh
what
a
gift
we
can
all
possess
it
we
need
it
as
we
are
crossing
the
sea
of
life
many
storms
arise
and
billows
roll
high
but
the
soul
possesses
this
valuable
treasure
of
peace
there
is
a
stillness
a
calmness
a
peacefulness
in
the
soul
that
stormy
winds
can
never
disturb
this
peace
that
jesus
gives
is
given
us
through
our
obedience
oh
that
thou
hadst
hearkened
to
my
commandments
then
had
thy
peace
been
as
a
river
what
is
more
peaceful
than
the
calm
even
flowing
of
a
river
as
we
look
upon
it
a
quiet
peacefulness
begins
to
spread
its
mantle
over
our
hearts
still
waters
are
a
beautiful
emblem
of
peace
while
troubled
waters
are
a
picture
of
unrest
this
peace
that
jesus
gives
is
unlike
anything
that
the
world
gives
this
world
contains
many
pleasant
things
and
makes
many
very
liberal
offers
but
peace
is
never
found
by
accepting
any
of
them
the
pleasures
of
this
world
leave
a
bitter
taste
while
the
hardships
we
endure
for
jesus
sweetens
our
cup
shall
we
analyze
this
peace
that
we
may
know
all
about
it
even
the
very
hidden
secret
of
the
principle
the
apostle
says
the
peace
of
god
which
i
passeth
all
understanding
shall
keep
your
hearts
and
minds
let
us
be
satisfied
to
have
our
hearts
and
minds
kept
by
this
wonderful
peace
though
we
do
not
understand
it
i
have
some
flowers
on
my
desk
there
are
white
ones
and
yellow
and
purple
and
red
and
pale
blue
i
do
not
understand
the
principle
of
life
that
gives
them
such
beauty
and
fragrance
if
i
should
dissect
them
in
order
to
discover
this
secret
i
should
destroy
their
beauty
and
be
no
wiser
we
can
not
understand
this
peace
but
we
can
possess
it
there
is
power
in
this
peace
to
keep
the
heart
and
mind
let
the
peace
of
god
rule
in
your
hearts
give
thy
heart
over
to
its
calm
still
power
it
will
rule
very
quietly
in
your
soul
but
rule
with
kingly
power
the
waters
can
not
rise
in
trouble
where
peace
holds
sway
when
this
secret
power
has
dominion
in
our
hearts
it
speaks
peace
to
all
around
it
says
to
the
waves
and
the
winds
peace
be
still
on
the
attacking
fears
on
the
threatening
circumstances
it
lays
a
quiet
hand
and
whispers
peace
be
still
and
great
is
the
calmness
of
thy
soul
some
scriptures
for
daily
practise
if
we
seek
god
earnestly
in
the
prayer
of
faith
to
help
us
in
our
daily
practise
of
the
following
scriptural
texts
and
then
put
forth
our
best
efforts
we
shall
find
life
daily
growing
more
holy
and
beautiful
the
beauty
and
enjoyment
of
a
holy
life
is
that
it
can
always
be
improved
upon
we
can
live
in
all
the
light
that
shines
upon
us
from
these
texts
today
but
tomorrow
we
find
them
shining
a
little
brighter
and
fuller
light
so
that
we
shall
have
to
live
a
little
more
holy
than
we
are
living
today
thus
all
along
our
christian
way
we
shall
find
that
we
are
growing
and
becoming
holier
in
life
and
more
of
the
transcendent
beauty
of
jesus
will
be
seen
upon
us
and
be
ye
kind
one
to
another
forgiving
one
another
even
as
god
for
christ
sake
hath
forgiven
you
eph
let
this
law
of
kindness
get
into
your
life
as
its
very
essence
it
is
not
enough
to
affect
kindness
we
must
be
kind
a
tender
heart
is
the
groundwork
of
kindness
out
of
such
a
soil
the
beautiful
flowers
of
gentleness
kindness
and
tenderness
grow
these
perfume
the
life
and
make
it
cheering
to
others
can
you
be
more
kind
in
your
daily
life
is
your
heart
so
tender
that
it
feels
the
suffering
of
the
child
or
the
pain
of
the
dumb
animal
to
the
extent
that
you
find
pleasure
in
giving
relief
even
at
the
expense
of
set
your
affection
on
things
above
not
on
things
on
the
earth
guard
your
heart
keep
it
with
all
diligence
see
that
all
of
its
affections
are
on
things
above
some
of
the
earthly
things
that
god
has
given
into
your
keeping
will
want
some
of
your
affection
the
beautiful
home
the
farm
the
the
domestic
animals
and
even
some
things
almost
worthless
will
want
a
little
of
your
heart
love
your
own
talents
and
personal
appearance
may
desire
some
of
your
affection
just
enough
to
set
you
approving
them
for
your
own
sake
practise
daily
the
above
text
in
everything
give
thanks
thess
giving
thanks
always
for
all
things
eph
thankfulness
is
a
grace
easily
improved
and
developed
if
cultivated
likewise
it
will
very
soon
degenerate
if
neglected
in
order
to
keep
a
deep
sense
of
thankfulness
in
our
hearts
we
must
be
mindful
of
the
gracious
dealings
of
god
it
is
well
to
take
time
as
often
as
circumstances
will
permit
to
meditate
in
some
quiet
place
upon
the
goodness
of
god
to
you
we
should
have
such
thankful
hearts
that
ofttimes
tears
of
gratitude
will
flow
at
the
remembrance
af
god
goodness
rejoice
evermore
thess
as
sorrowful
yet
alway
rejoicing
cor
rejoice
alway
and
again
i
say
rejoice
phil
count
it
all
joy
when
ye
fall
into
divers
temptations
jas
this
is
the
power
of
the
christian
life
we
can
always
rejoice
we
can
be
contented
and
happy
whatever
our
circumstances
in
life
god
grace
will
sustain
us
every
day
can
be
and
should
be
a
day
of
rejoicing
god
is
pleased
to
have
us
happy
but
he
would
have
our
rejoicing
to
be
in
him
and
not
in
his
blessings
to
rejoice
in
the
midst
of
trial
is
health
to
the
soul
pray
without
ceasing
thess
continue
in
prayer
and
watch
in
the
same
with
thanksgiving
praying
always
with
all
prayer
and
supplication
in
the
spirit
and
watching
thereunto
with
all
perseverance
and
supplication
for
all
saints
eph
if
you
value
peace
and
prosperity
of
soul
you
will
not
neglect
to
pray
it
is
prayer
that
keeps
us
up
above
the
clouds
and
brings
heaven
down
he
who
does
not
pray
at
all
is
not
a
christian
and
he
who
does
not
pray
much
is
not
much
of
a
christian
it
is
not
those
who
have
plenty
of
time
to
pray
that
do
the
most
praying
but
they
who
take
the
time
let
there
be
some
prayer
every
day
let
nothing
be
done
through
strife
or
vainglory
but
in
lowliness
of
mind
let
each
esteem
others
better
than
themselves
phil
this
should
be
the
experience
of
your
heart
every
day
when
we
are
lowly
we
see
our
own
faults
and
imperfections
and
our
brother
virtues
therefore
we
look
upon
him
as
better
than
ourselves
it
seems
to
us
that
others
are
more
humble
than
we
are
and
have
more
faith
and
love
god
more
than
we
do
look
not
every
man
on
his
own
things
but
every
man
also
on
the
things
of
others
phil
we
should
be
as
much
concerned
in
others
welfare
as
in
our
own
he
who
is
looking
out
for
himself
and
neglecting
others
has
not
advanced
very
far
in
the
christian
life
the
christian
lives
for
others
he
will
overlook
his
own
needs
and
see
his
brother
needs
see
that
none
render
evil
for
evil
unto
any
man
but
ever
follow
that
which
is
good
both
among
yourselves
and
to
all
men
i
thess
and
let
us
not
be
weary
in
for
in
due
season
we
shall
reap
if
we
faint
not
as
we
have
therefore
opportunity
let
us
do
good
unto
all
men
especially
unto
them
who
are
of
the
household
of
faith
gal
to
go
about
doing
good
out
of
a
heart
full
of
love
is
the
way
to
spend
life
heaven
is
going
to
reward
us
according
to
our
works
the
bible
tells
us
so
never
a
day
should
go
by
without
our
having
done
some
good
thing
purposely
out
of
love
to
god
and
man
the
lord
does
not
overlook
small
deeds
when
done
in
love
a
coral
is
very
small
but
many
of
them
make
an
island
a
little
good
deed
done
every
day
will
in
a
lifetime
amount
to
enough
to
build
a
splendid
mansion
in
heaven
bear
ye
one
another
burdens
and
so
fulfil
the
law
of
christ
gal
to
lift
a
load
from
off
the
shoulders
of
another
is
noble
service
to
remove
a
burden
from
another
heart
is
truly
christlike
he
who
goes
through
life
bearing
the
burdens
of
others
has
found
the
easiest
road
he
who
goes
through
life
refusing
to
aid
others
travels
a
road
of
hardest
toil
abhor
that
which
is
evil
rom
god
is
holy
consequently
he
hates
that
which
is
evil
when
we
admire
the
holiness
of
god
we
loathe
sin
if
sin
has
no
horror
to
our
soul
holiness
has
no
beauty
to
the
extent
we
love
holiness
to
that
extent
we
hate
sin
a
good
man
of
long
ago
said
if
i
could
see
the
shame
of
sin
on
the
one
hand
and
the
pain
of
hell
on
the
other
and
must
of
necessity
choose
one
i
would
rather
be
thrust
into
hell
without
sin
than
go
to
heaven
with
sin
sin
is
a
hideous
monster
draw
near
to
god
if
you
would
see
sin
awful
hideousness
unlike
most
other
things
the
farther
you
are
away
from
sin
the
more
clearly
you
can
see
it
as
it
really
is
cleave
to
that
which
is
good
rom
to
cleave
to
is
to
adhere
tightly
to
cling
we
cleave
to
that
which
is
good
by
ever
doing
good
when
we
hate
sin
as
we
should
and
see
its
awful
shame
and
love
the
good
and
see
its
wondrous
beauty
we
would
rather
go
to
hell
doing
good
than
to
heaven
committing
sin
draw
nigh
to
god
jas
the
close
of
every
day
should
find
us
a
little
nearer
god
than
the
evening
before
we
should
hide
a
little
more
secretely
in
his
pavilion
we
should
nestle
a
little
more
closely
under
his
wing
his
feathers
should
cover
us
a
little
more
fully
be
the
storms
what
they
may
we
can
daily
live
very
close
to
god
and
what
we
can
do
it
is
our
duty
to
do
open
thy
mouth
wide
psa
we
should
daily
live
with
mouth
if
we
will
the
promise
is
that
god
will
fill
it
for
god
to
be
all
to
us
we
must
expect
all
from
him
god
can
impart
to
us
only
what
our
hearts
are
open
to
receive
if
we
would
live
with
god
in
our
own
soul
we
must
have
all
our
soul
open
to
receive
him
many
fail
to
see
the
beauty
of
a
life
hid
with
god
because
they
are
looking
too
much
earthward
opening
the
mouth
wide
implies
an
abandonment
of
ourself
to
god
with
a
readiness
to
receive
all
that
god
has
to
give
together
with
an
expectation
to
receive
nothing
that
does
not
come
from
him
then
god
will
fill
us
daily
with
himself
there
will
be
a
constant
inflowing
from
god
of
strength
and
ability
to
perform
every
duty
of
life
and
of
grace
and
peace
to
make
life
an
emblem
of
heaven
the
god
of
our
fathers
hath
chosen
thee
that
thou
shouldest
i
know
his
will
acts
not
with
as
but
as
the
servants
of
christ
i
doing
the
will
of
god
from
the
heart
eph
i
i
delight
to
do
thy
will
o
my
god
psa
it
is
our
privilege
to
daily
i
know
the
will
of
god
it
is
our
duty
to
daily
i
do
it
it
is
a
blessing
to
love
to
do
it
here
is
the
sum
of
all
christian
living
knowing
the
will
of
god
doing
the
will
of
god
doing
the
will
of
god
in
love
i
asked
the
for
some
motto
sweet
some
rule
of
life
with
which
to
guide
my
feet
i
asked
and
paused
he
answered
soft
and
low
will
to
know
knowledge
then
suffice
i
cried
and
the
question
into
silence
died
the
answer
came
but
remember
too
god
will
to
do
once
more
i
asked
there
no
more
to
tell
and
once
again
the
answer
sweetly
fell
this
one
thing
all
other
things
above
god
will
to
love
do
all
things
without
murmurings
and
disputings
phil
let
thy
life
be
free
from
all
frettings
and
worryings
let
it
be
like
the
calm
flowing
of
the
river
god
is
a
strong
and
high
tower
a
refuge
a
shield
with
our
life
hidden
in
him
worries
and
frettings
can
not
reach
us
we
may
be
treated
unjustly
by
a
bosom
friend
but
we
commit
it
to
god
and
instead
of
feeling
the
wound
the
friend
gives
we
feel
the
balm
our
father
gives
be
content
with
such
things
as
ye
have
heb
i
have
learned
in
whatsoever
state
i
am
therewith
to
be
content
phil
he
who
has
gained
contentment
has
gained
more
than
he
who
has
gained
the
wealth
of
a
world
if
it
be
contentment
with
godliness
a
discontented
life
is
a
dark
spot
on
the
page
of
human
history
an
even
contented
life
is
as
a
lighthouse
shedding
its
peaceful
beams
over
the
turbulent
waters
where
voyagers
come
and
go
i
can
do
all
things
through
christ
which
strengtheneth
me
phil
i
am
mighty
enough
for
all
things
through
christ
who
empowers
me
rotherham
there
is
no
excuse
for
your
not
living
a
perfectly
victorious
life
today
you
can
be
a
conqueror
temptations
will
assail
you
trials
will
come
but
you
can
ignore
them
in
such
a
way
as
to
show
their
author
your
contempt
for
both
him
and
his
temptations
i
read
just
this
morning
this
good
suggestion
do
not
dwell
upon
your
temptations
they
are
like
little
dogs
that
bark
after
a
man
that
passes
by
if
he
stops
to
drive
them
away
they
bark
more
fiercely
than
before
you
can
do
all
things
through
christ
but
you
must
do
them
in
his
way
ofttimes
he
would
have
you
ignore
temptations
instead
of
fighting
them
it
is
well
ofttimes
not
even
to
ask
who
is
there
when
temptations
come
knocking
at
your
door
put
on
therefore
as
the
elect
of
god
holy
and
beloved
bowels
of
mercies
kindness
humbleness
of
mind
meekness
forbearing
one
another
and
forgiving
one
another
if
any
man
have
a
quarrel
against
any
even
as
christ
forgave
you
so
also
do
ye
such
a
life
is
a
heavenly
life
think
these
words
over
and
make
them
your
experience
today
have
bowels
of
mercies
that
yearning
longing
compassionate
feeling
that
would
gladly
bring
every
offender
to
jesus
for
forgiveness
be
kind
oh
the
power
of
kindness
it
can
not
be
resisted
it
conquers
wherever
it
goes
this
cold
world
knows
no
music
so
sweet
as
kindness
it
charms
and
delights
the
ears
of
all
if
you
would
be
kind
in
word
and
act
be
kind
in
thought
be
humble
in
mind
think
well
of
others
and
not
so
well
of
yourself
life
will
flow
on
peacefully
and
easily
if
we
are
humble
nothing
can
disturb
be
meek
sweet
and
mild
tempered
bear
long
with
the
failings
and
weaknesses
of
others
carefully
considering
your
own
and
keeping
in
mind
how
you
would
like
to
have
others
bear
with
you
and
above
all
these
things
put
on
charity
which
is
the
bond
of
perfectness
throw
the
mantle
of
love
over
every
act
and
thought
in
life
love
purely
love
sincerely
love
fervently
nothing
is
so
great
as
love
all
the
graces
have
their
seat
in
love
you
can
not
be
compassionate
kind
humble
meek
or
forbearing
without
love
and
let
the
peace
of
god
rule
in
your
hearts
let
the
peace
of
god
act
as
umpire
deciding
every
case
let
it
have
the
ruling
power
in
your
heart
and
life
today
and
every
day
whatever
matters
may
arise
let
the
peace
of
god
take
it
in
hand
and
dispose
of
it
if
it
shows
any
resistance
then
let
the
peace
of
god
cast
it
out
let
your
speech
be
alway
with
grace
seasoned
with
salt
that
ye
may
know
how
ye
ought
to
answer
every
man
let
no
corrupt
communication
proceed
out
of
your
mouth
but
that
which
is
good
to
the
use
of
edifying
that
it
may
minister
grace
unto
the
hearers
eph
have
a
pure
speech
made
mighty
by
the
grace
of
god
be
sober
without
gloom
be
serious
with
cheerfulness
have
such
a
conversation
as
is
suited
to
lift
hearts
to
a
higher
plane
your
words
should
be
such
as
to
make
better
those
you
talk
with
and
make
them
feel
that
there
is
something
higher
for
them
redeeming
the
time
because
the
days
are
evil
eph
time
is
more
than
money
it
is
life
do
not
waste
it
improve
its
golden
moments
today
be
economical
in
its
use
many
complain
of
not
having
time
for
devotional
reading
and
for
prayer
while
if
they
would
examine
carefully
they
would
find
that
they
trifle
away
as
much
time
as
would
he
needed
for
prayer
each
day
submitting
yourselves
one
to
another
in
the
fear
of
god
eph
this
is
beautiful
submissiveness
is
a
desirable
grace
and
one
that
will
strew
your
pathway
with
peace
how
blessed
it
is
to
be
always
ready
to
give
up
our
way
it
is
the
easy
way
we
shall
find
life
way
a
hard
road
to
travel
if
we
are
always
wanting
our
way
be
careful
for
nothing
phil
casting
all
your
care
upon
him
for
he
careth
for
you
pet
take
no
thought
for
your
life
what
ye
shall
eat
or
what
ye
shall
drink
nor
yet
for
your
body
what
ye
shall
put
on
matt
the
christian
life
is
one
of
freedom
from
anxiety
jesus
will
bear
all
our
burdens
and
cares
if
we
will
but
cast
them
on
him
there
is
no
need
to
worry
nor
to
bear
a
load
of
care
a
certain
brother
was
much
troubled
about
not
having
bread
for
the
next
meal
but
while
he
was
troubling
himself
and
bearing
his
load
a
man
drove
up
and
unloaded
a
barrel
of
flour
at
the
door
all
the
time
the
brother
was
troubled
the
barrel
of
flour
was
on
the
way
take
no
anxiety
for
future
things
commune
with
your
own
heart
upon
your
bed
and
be
still
psa
each
evening
in
some
quiet
place
and
with
interior
stillness
talk
with
your
heart
and
let
your
heart
talk
to
you
take
a
distinctive
view
of
your
inward
life
you
need
to
be
very
careful
lest
you
outwardly
appear
to
be
a
little
more
than
you
really
are
inwardly
i
am
crucified
with
christ
nevertheless
i
live
yet
not
i
but
christ
liveth
in
me
gal
is
it
true
does
jesus
live
in
you
if
you
are
smitten
upon
the
right
cheek
does
jesus
then
live
in
you
if
you
are
evil
spoken
of
misrepresented
misunderstood
neglected
dispised
and
forsaken
does
jesus
live
in
you
then
if
you
see
your
brother
in
need
if
you
have
two
coats
and
he
has
none
does
jesus
live
in
you
then
there
are
some
in
prison
near
you
there
are
those
who
are
sick
there
are
those
who
are
thirsty
and
hungry
in
foreign
lands
there
are
heathen
that
know
not
god
are
you
sure
jesus
lives
in
you
behold
i
go
forward
but
he
is
not
there
and
backward
but
i
can
not
perceive
him
on
the
left
hand
where
he
doth
work
but
i
can
not
behold
him
he
hideth
himself
on
the
right
hand
that
i
can
not
see
him
job
this
may
be
your
experience
some
days
in
fact
if
you
are
making
progress
and
at
all
approaching
maturity
you
will
have
such
experiences
some
dear
conscientious
christians
become
much
troubled
because
they
are
not
more
conscious
of
god
presence
they
do
not
feel
him
and
thus
they
conclude
they
must
be
very
formal
i
have
always
believed
and
taught
that
we
should
have
a
consciousness
of
god
presence
with
us
i
still
believe
and
teach
it
but
i
must
admit
that
the
most
spiritual
ofttimes
can
not
perceive
god
on
either
hand
they
may
fear
that
they
are
lifeless
because
there
is
not
a
fresh
and
sweet
spontaneous
feeling
in
their
souls
it
seems
to
them
that
they
merely
go
through
the
form
of
worshiping
god
instead
of
being
in
the
spirit
they
pray
but
their
prayers
seem
to
have
no
depth
of
heart
in
consequence
they
may
be
troubled
they
need
not
be
we
are
not
necessarily
lukewarm
because
we
do
not
feel
god
the
most
humble
men
are
those
who
are
least
conscious
of
their
humility
the
greatest
of
men
are
those
who
take
no
note
of
their
greatness
the
christian
has
life
but
when
we
get
in
the
habit
of
living
we
are
not
so
conscious
of
life
let
me
illustrate
the
point
in
this
way
suppose
your
weakness
to
be
selfishness
you
struggle
hard
against
that
selfish
principle
you
notice
that
you
are
becoming
more
unselfish
you
are
conscious
of
it
because
you
have
had
to
put
forth
such
effort
to
attain
it
but
after
you
have
gained
the
victory
and
have
become
habituated
to
living
an
unselfish
life
you
will
be
less
conscious
of
your
unselfishness
the
musician
is
not
so
conscious
of
his
skill
after
he
has
mastered
the
art
as
he
is
while
learning
it
those
who
are
the
meekest
and
have
the
most
intimate
converse
with
heaven
diffusing
a
fragrance
round
about
them
from
their
holy
lives
and
seeming
to
be
visitants
from
some
world
where
there
is
no
sin
these
are
least
conscious
of
their
high
spiritual
attainments
live
a
holy
life
obey
the
commandments
of
god
have
a
will
to
serve
god
and
if
sometimes
you
do
not
feel
him
nor
perceive
him
do
not
be
troubled
but
consider
that
he
knows
the
way
you
take
and
that
when
he
has
tried
you
you
shall
come
forth
as
gold
be
kindly
affectioned
one
to
another
with
brotherly
love
rom
brotherly
love
is
precious
in
the
sight
of
angels
it
is
the
most
convincing
proof
of
the
christian
religion
by
this
shall
all
men
know
that
ye
are
my
disciples
if
ye
have
love
one
for
another
but
in
addition
to
brotherly
love
there
should
be
kind
affection
this
is
love
felt
and
expressed
there
are
those
who
really
love
yet
whose
nature
is
such
that
they
do
not
feel
much
love
kind
affection
like
every
other
grace
is
capable
of
cultivation
in
honor
preferring
one
another
not
slothful
in
business
fervent
in
spirit
serving
the
lord
rejoicing
in
hope
patient
in
tribulation
continuing
instant
in
prayer
rom
these
words
contain
depth
of
experience
but
only
by
prayer
and
deep
meditation
can
we
descend
to
their
depth
but
we
must
close
by
referring
you
to
the
whole
of
the
bible
it
is
a
holy
book
yea
the
holiest
of
books
a
life
in
harmony
with
its
precepts
is
the
holiest
life
such
a
life
will
grace
the
earth
and
shine
as
a
star
forever
in
heaven
cleave
to
the
bible
study
its
pages
appropriate
its
truths
to
your
own
heart
by
faith
by
living
upon
the
word
of
god
we
become
more
like
god
heavenly
words
taken
into
the
heart
form
a
heavenly
life
let
your
soul
be
fed
each
day
from
the
blessed
book
of
god
take
the
time
drink
deep
into
its
pure
crystal
stream
and
the
beauty
of
the
lord
will
grow
upon
you
watch
the
little
things
in
life
the
thought
the
word
the
act
until
you
bring
the
whole
of
your
life
into
the
habit
of
acting
godly
be
as
kind
as
you
can
be
today
and
you
can
be
kinder
tomorrow
this
is
for
the
christian
we
do
not
become
christians
by
growth
but
we
must
grow
after
we
become
christians
we
can
be
more
patient
tomorrow
by
being
as
patient
as
we
can
be
today
we
can
be
better
men
tomorrow
by
being
our
best
today
we
grow
as
we
live
if
we
live
the
right
way
we
shall
grow
that
way
and
the
longer
we
grow
that
way
the
more
natural
and
easy
the
way
therefore
let
your
whole
life
flow
out
in
a
trend
with
the
bible
until
it
wears
a
channel
in
holiness
and
christian
character
gather
food
daily
for
your
soul
from
the
sacred
page
live
in
the
most
intimate
communion
with
god
that
is
possible
meditate
in
his
law
day
and
night
let
the
love
of
your
heart
grow
warmer
let
life
be
the
holiest
possible
do
this
and
you
will
be
one
of
the
jewels
god
will
gather
to
bedeck
the
temple
of
the
skies
a
tender
blue
is
in
the
sky
as
sets
the
golden
sun
another
day
is
passing
by
and
thus
the
moments
run
the
note
is
soft
and
low
flying
to
leafy
nest
in
evening
peaceful
twilight
glow
all
nature
sinks
to
rest
the
fields
are
wrapped
in
somber
shroud
as
fades
the
light
of
day
a
tender
flush
is
on
the
cloud
beside
the
milky
way
a
hush
is
on
this
world
of
ours
day
dying
drops
a
tear
angels
hands
unveil
the
stars
which
one
by
one
appear
now
pleiades
grow
sparkling
bright
in
deepening
blue
above
o
mild
serene
autumnal
night
thy
voice
is
full
of
love
such
sacred
awe
my
soul
doth
fill
such
quietness
doth
reign
the
voice
that
uttered
peace
be
still
has
whispered
once
again
the
silver
bars
that
streak
the
west
are
one
by
one

has
gone
to
rest
and
thus
the
moments
run

to
see
some
day
and
