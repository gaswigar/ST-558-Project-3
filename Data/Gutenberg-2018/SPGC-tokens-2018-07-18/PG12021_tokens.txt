adopting
an
abandoned
farm
chapter
i
from
gotham
to
gooseville
i
have
now
come
to
the
farmer
life
with
which
i
am
exceedingly
delighted
and
which
seems
to
me
to
belong
especially
to
the
life
of
a
wise
man
cicero
weary
of
boarding
at
seashore
and
mountain
tired
of
traveling
in
search
of
comfort
hating
hotel
life
i
visited
a
country
friend
at
gooseville
an
assumed
name
for
foxboro
mass
and
passed
three
happy
weeks
in
her
peaceful
home
far
away
at
last
from
the
garish
horrors
of
dress
formal
dinners
visits
and
drives
the
inevitable
and
demoralizing
gossip
and
scandal
far
away
from
hotel
piazzas
with
their
tedious
accompaniments
of
corpulent
dowagers
exclusive
or
inquisitive
slowly
dying
from
too
much
food
and
too
little
exercise
ennuied
spinsters
gushing
buds
athletic
collegians
cigarettes
in
mouths
and
hands
in
pockets
languid
drawling
dudes
old
bachelors
fluttering
around
the
fair
human
flower
like
september
butterflies
fancy
work
fancy
work
like
penelope
web
never
finished
pug
dogs
of
the
aged
and
asthmatic
variety
everything
there
but
men
they
are
wise
enough
to
keep
far
away
before
leaving
this
haven
of
rest
i
heard
that
the
just
opposite
was
for
sale
and
as
purchasers
of
real
estate
were
infrequent
at
gooseville
it
would
be
rented
for
forty
dollars
a
year
to
any
responsible
tenant
who
would
keep
it
up
after
examining
the
house
from
garret
to
cellar
and
looking
over
the
fields
with
a
critical
eye
i
telegraphed
to
the
owner
fearful
of
losing
such
a
prize
that
i
would
take
it
for
three
years
for
it
captivated
me
the
cosy
with
a
pie
closet
and
an
upper
tiny
cupboard
known
as
a
rum
closet
and
its
pretty
fire
place
bricked
up
but
capable
of
being
rescued
from
such
prosaic
desuetude
a
large
sunny
with
a
brick
oven
an
oven
suggestive
of
brown
bread
and
baked
beans
yes
the
baked
beans
of
my
childhood
that
adorned
the
breakfast
table
on
a
sunday
morning
cooked
with
just
a
little
molasses
and
a
square
piece
of
crisp
salt
pork
in
center
a
dish
to
tempt
a
dying
anchorite
there
wore
two
broad
landings
on
the
stairs
the
lower
one
just
the
place
for
an
old
clock
to
tick
out
its
impressive
forever
never
never
forever
i
à
la
longfellow
then
the
long
shed
chamber
with
a
wide
swinging
door
opening
to
the
west
framing
a
sunset
gorgeous
enough
to
inspire
a
mummy
and
the
attic
with
its
possible
treasures
there
was
also
a
queer
little
room
dark
and
mysterious
in
the
center
of
house
on
the
ground
floor
without
even
one
window
convenient
to
retire
to
during
severe
thunder
storms
or
to
evade
a
personal
interview
with
a
burglar
just
the
place
too
for
a
restless
ghost
to
revisit
best
of
all
every
room
was
blessed
with
two
closets
outside
what
rare
attractions
acres
of
arable
land
stretching
to
the
south
a
grand
old
barn
with
dusty
cobwebbed
lofts
stalls
for
two
horses
and
five
cows
hen
houses
with
plenty
of
room
to
carry
out
a
plan
of
starting
a
poultry
farm
the
situation
too
was
exceptional
since
the
station
from
which
i
could
take
trains
direct
to
boston
and
new
york
almost
touched
the
northern
corner
of
the
farm
and
nothing
makes
one
so
willing
to
stay
in
a
secluded
spot
as
the
certainty
that
he
or
she
can
leave
it
at
any
time
and
plunge
directly
into
the
excitements
and
pleasures
which
only
a
large
city
gives
what
charmed
me
most
of
all
was
a
tiny
but
fascinating
lakelet
in
the
pasture
near
the
house
a
it
was
called
by
the
natives
but
a
lakelet
it
was
to
me
full
of
the
most
entrancing
possibilities
it
could
be
easily
enlarged
at
once
and
by
putting
a
on
the
hill
by
the
deep
pool
in
chicken
brook
where
the
pickerel
loved
to
sport
and
damming
something
somewhere
i
could
create
or
evolve
a
miniature
pond
transplant
water
lilies
pink
and
white
set
willow
shoots
around
the
graveled
edge
with
roots
of
the
hiding
under
the
banks
their
blue
blossoms
just
the
flower
for
happy
lovers
to
gather
as
they
lingered
in
their
rambles
to
feed
my
trout
and
there
should
be
an
arbor
and
sheltered
from
the
curious
gaze
of
the
and
a
little
boat
moored
at
a
little
wharf
and
a
plank
walk
leading
up
to
the
house
and
and
oh
the
idealism
possible
when
an
enthusiastic
woman
first
rents
a
farm
an
abandoned
farm
it
may
be
more
exact
to
say
that
my
farm
was
not
exactly
abandoned
as
its
owner
desired
a
tenant
and
paid
the
taxes
say
rather
depressed
full
of
evil
from
long
neglect
suffering
from
lack
of
food
and
general
debility
as
abandoned
farms
are
now
a
subject
of
general
interest
let
me
say
that
my
find
was
nothing
unusual
the
number
of
farms
without
occupants
in
new
hampshire
in
august
was
and
in
maine
and
i
saw
lately
a
farm
of
twenty
acres
advertised
free
rent
and
a
present
of
fifty
dollars
but
it
is
my
farm
i
want
you
to
care
about
i
could
hardly
wait
until
winter
was
over
to
begin
my
new
avocation
by
the
last
of
march
i
was
assured
by
practical
agriculturists
who
regarded
me
with
amusement
tempered
with
pity
that
it
was
high
time
to
prune
the
lazy
fruit
trees
and
arouse
if
possible
the
debilitated
soil
in
short
begin
to
keep
it
up
so
i
left
new
york
for
the
scene
of
my
future
labors
and
novel
lessons
in
life
accompanied
by
a
german
girl
who
proved
to
be
merely
an
animated
onion
in
matters
of
cooking
a
hired
man
and
a
setter
pup
who
suffered
severely
from
nostalgia
and
strongly
objected
to
the
baggage
car
and
separation
from
his
playmates
if
wit
is
as
has
been
averred
the
juxtaposition
of
dissimilar
ideas
then
from
gotham
to
gooseville
is
the
most
scintillating
epigram
ever
achieved
nothing
was
going
on
at
gooseville
except
time
and
the
milk
wagon
collecting
for
the
creamery
the
latter
came
rumbling
along
every
morning
at
precisely
with
a
clatter
of
cans
that
never
failed
to
arouse
the
soundest
sleeper
the
general
dreariness
of
the
landscape
was
depressing
nature
herself
seemed
in
a
lethargic
trance
and
her
name
was
mud
but
with
a
house
to
furnish
and
enfeebled
acres
to
resuscitate
one
must
not
mind
advanced
scientists
assure
us
of
life
motion
even
intelligence
appetite
and
affection
in
the
most
primitive
primordial
atoms
so
after
a
little
study
i
found
that
the
inhabitants
of
gooseville
and
its
outlying
hamlets
were
neither
dead
nor
sleeping
it
was
only
by
contrast
that
they
appeared
comatose
and
moribund
indeed
the
degree
of
gayety
was
quite
startling
i
was
at
once
invited
to
gatherings
which
rejoiced
in
the
paradoxical
title
of
mum
sociables
where
a
penalty
of
five
cents
was
imposed
on
each
person
for
speaking
the
revenue
to
go
toward
buying
a
new
hearse
a
cheerful
object
of
benevolence
and
the
occasions
were
most
enjoyable
there
was
also
a
crazy
party
at
the
next
village
this
special
form
of
lunacy
i
did
not
indulge
in
farming
was
enough
for
me
but
the
painter
who
was
enlivening
my
with
a
coating
of
vivid
red
and
green
kindly
told
me
all
about
it
how
much
i
missed
and
how
the
couple
looked
who
took
the
first
prize
the
lady
wore
tin
plates
tin
cans
tin
spoons
sewed
on
to
skirt
and
waist
in
fantastic
patterns
making
music
as
she
walked
and
on
her
head
a
battered
old
coffee
pot
with
artificial
flowers
which
had
outlived
their
usefulness
sticking
out
of
the
spout
and
her
winning
partner
was
arrayed
in
rag
patchwork
of
the
most
demented
variety
youdorter
gone
said
he
was
a
great
show
but
i
bet
youder
beaten
the
hull
lot
on
if
you
set
your
mind
o
my
walls
were
now
covered
with
papers
five
and
ten
cents
a
roll
and
cheap
matting
improved
the
floors
but
how
to
furnish
eleven
rooms
this
brings
me
to
chapter
ii
auctions
going
going
gone
next
came
the
excitement
of
auctions
great
occasions
and
of
vital
importance
to
me
as
i
was
ambitious
to
furnish
the
entire
house
for
one
hundred
dollars
when
the
head
of
a
family
dies
a
settlement
of
the
estate
seems
to
make
an
auction
necessary
i
am
glad
of
the
custom
it
proved
of
invaluable
service
to
me
and
the
mortality
among
old
people
was
quite
phenomenal
at
gooseville
and
thereabouts
last
year
while
i
deeply
regretted
the
demise
of
each
and
all
still
this
general
taking
off
was
opportune
for
my
needs
there
were
seventeen
auctions
last
season
and
all
but
two
were
attended
by
me
or
my
representatives
a
country
auction
is
not
so
exciting
as
one
in
the
city
still
you
must
be
and
cool
or
you
will
be
fleeced
an
experienced
friend
acquainted
with
the
auctioneer
piloted
me
through
my
first
sale
and
for
ten
dollars
i
bought
enough
really
valuable
furniture
to
fill
a
large
express
wagon
as
a
large
desk
with
drawers
little
and
big
fascinating
pigeon
holes
and
a
secret
drawer
for
two
dollars
queer
old
table
ten
cents
good
solid
chairs
nine
cents
each
mahogany
one
dollar
and
sixteen
cents
and
best
of
all
a
tall
and
venerable
clock
for
the
landing
only
eight
dollars
its
innards
sadly
demoralized
but
capable
of
resuscitation
the
weights
being
filled
with
sand
and
attached
by
strong
twine
to
the
works
it
has
to
be
wound
twice
daily
and
when
the
hour
hand
points
to
six
and
the
other
to
ten
i
guess
that
it
is
about
quarter
past
two
and
in
five
minutes
i
hear
the
senile
timepiece
strike
eleven
the
scene
was
unique
the
sale
had
been
advertised
in
and
stores
as
beginning
at
but
at
eleven
the
farmers
and
their
women
folks
were
driving
toward
the
house
a
dozen
old
men
chewing
tobacco
and
looking
wise
were
in
the
barn
yard
examining
the
stock
to
be
sold
the
carts
and
farming
tools
a
flock
of
hens
were
also
to
be
disposed
of
at
forty
cents
each
on
such
occasions
the
families
from
far
and
near
who
want
to
dispose
of
any
old
truck
are
allowed
to
bring
it
to
add
to
the
motley
display
the
really
valuable
possessions
if
any
are
kept
back
either
for
private
sale
or
to
be
divided
among
the
heirs
i
saw
genuine
antiques
occasionally
old
oak
chests
finely
carved
oaken
chairs
but
these
were
rare
after
the
horses
have
been
driven
up
and
down
the
street
and
with
the
other
stock
disposed
of
it
is
time
for
lunch
following
the
crowd
into
the
kitchen
you
see
two
barrels
of
crackers
open
a
mammoth
cheese
of
the
species
with
a
big
knife
by
it
and
on
the
stove
a
giant
kettle
in
which
cotton
bags
full
of
coffee
are
being
distilled
in
boiling
water
you
are
expected
to
dip
a
heavy
white
mug
into
the
kettle
for
your
share
of
the
fragrant
reviving
beverage
cut
off
a
hunk
of
cheese
and
eat
as
many
crackers
as
you
can
it
tasted
well
that
informal
free
lunch
finding
after
one
or
two
trials
that
the
interested
parties
raised
rapidly
on
anything
i
desired
i
used
to
send
gusta
and
john
nicknamed
very
properly
omniscience
and
omnipotence
which
names
did
equally
well
when
reversed
like
a
paper
cuff
and
they
less
verdant
than
their
mistress
would
return
with
an
amazing
array
of
stuff
we
now
have
everything
but
a
pulpit
a
wooden
leg
and
a
coffin
plate
we
utilized
a
cradle
and
antique
churn
as
a
composite
flower
stand
an
immense
looks
pretty
covered
with
running
vines
an
old
carriage
lantern
gleams
brightly
on
my
piazza
every
evening
i
nearly
bought
a
horse
for
fifteen
dollars
and
did
secure
a
wagon
for
one
dollar
and
a
half
which
after
a
few
needed
repairs
costing
only
dollars
was
my
pride
delight
and
comfort
and
the
envy
of
the
neighborhood
men
came
from
near
and
far
to
examine
that
wagon
felt
critically
of
every
wheel
admired
the
shining
coat
of
paint
and
would
always
wind
up
with
i
vum
if
that
wagon
ai
fine
why
it
wuth
fifty
dollars
now
ef
it
wuth
a
cent
after
a
hard
day
work
it
seemed
a
gratification
to
them
to
come
with
lanterns
to
renew
their
critical
survey
making
a
fine
rembrandtish
study
as
they
stood
around
it
and
wondered
a
sleigh
was
bought
for
three
dollars
which
when
painted
by
our
home
artist
is
both
comfortable
and
effective
at
one
auction
where
i
was
the
only
woman
present
i
bid
on
three
shovels
needed
to
dig
worms
for
my
prize
hens
and
as
the
excitement
increased
with
a
rise
in
bids
from
two
cents
to
ten
i
cried
eleven
and
the
gallant
old
fellow
in
command
roared
out
as
a
man
opened
his
mouth
for
twelve
i
would
bid
a
woman
ef
you
let
have
madam
mum
or
miss
i
ca
pernounce
your
name
and
rightly
know
how
to
spell
it
but
the
shovels
are
yourn
attending
auctions
may
be
an
acquired
taste
but
it
grows
on
one
like
any
other
habit
and
whenever
a
new
and
tempting
announcement
calls
i
rise
to
the
occasion
and
hasten
to
the
scene
of
action
be
the
weather
what
it
may
and
many
a
treasure
has
been
picked
up
in
this
way
quaint
old
mirrors
with
the
queerest
pictures
above
brass
knockers
candlesticks
of
queer
patterns
cups
and
saucers
and
plates
mugs
of
all
sizes
from
one
generous
enough
to
satisfy
the
capacities
of
a
dutchman
to
a
dear
little
child
mug
evidently
once
belonging
to
a
series
mine
was
for
march
a
mother
sitting
on
a
bench
with
a
bowl
of
possibly
lenten
soup
by
her
side
is
reproving
a
fat
little
fellow
for
his
gross
appetite
at
this
solemn
season
he
is
weeping
and
on
her
other
side
a
pet
dog
is
pleading
to
be
fed
the
rhyme
explains
the
reason
the
jovial
days
of
feasting
past
is
pious
prudence
come
at
last
and
eager
gluttony
is
taught
to
be
content
with
what
it
ought
a
warming
pan
and
a
foot
stove
just
as
it
was
brought
home
from
a
merry
or
a
solemn
hour
at
the
recalling
that
line
of
thomas
gray
in
our
ashes
live
their
wonted
fires
sometimes
i
would
offer
a
little
more
to
gain
some
coveted
treasure
already
bid
off
how
a
city
friend
enjoyed
the
confidences
of
a
man
who
had
agreed
to
sell
for
a
profit
how
he
chuckled
as
he
told
of
one
of
them
women
who
he
guessed
was
a
leetle
crazy
why
jest
think
o
i
only
paid
ten
cents
for
that
hull
lot
on
the
table
yonder
and
i
she
pointing
to
me
i
she
gin
me
a
quarter
for
that
old
pair
o
tongs
one
day
i
heard
some
comments
on
myself
after
i
had
bid
on
a
rag
carpet
and
offered
more
than
the
other
women
knew
it
was
worth
she
got
a
million
i
hear
wanter
know
merried
no
just
an
old
maid
judas
priest
howd
she
git
it
writin
i
she
writes
love
stories
and
sich
for
city
papers
some
on
makes
a
lot
it
is
not
always
cheering
to
overhear
too
much
when
some
of
my
friends
whom
i
had
taken
to
a
favorite
junk
shop
felt
after
two
hours
of
purchase
and
exploration
that
they
must
not
keep
me
waiting
any
longer
the
man
in
his
eagerness
to
make
a
few
more
sales
exclaimed
let
her
wait
i
her
time
ai
wuth
nothin
at
an
auction
last
summer
one
man
told
me
of
a
very
venerable
lantern
an
heirloom
in
his
first
wife
family
i
so
long
measuring
nearly
a
yard
with
his
hands
i
said
i
should
like
to
go
with
him
to
see
it
as
i
was
making
a
collection
of
lanterns
he
looked
rather
dazed
and
as
i
turned
away
he
inquired
of
my
friend
if
i
wus
i
rather
she
never
allowed
him
to
finish
and
his
lantern
is
now
mine
people
seem
to
have
but
little
sentiment
about
their
associations
with
furniture
long
in
the
family
the
family
and
a
few
intimate
friends
usually
sit
at
the
upper
windows
gazing
curiously
on
the
crowd
with
no
evidence
of
feeling
or
pathetic
recollections
i
lately
heard
a
daughter
say
less
than
a
month
after
her
death
pointing
to
a
small
lounge
father
made
me
that
lounge
with
his
own
hands
when
i
a
little
girl
he
a
sight
it
and
allers
kep
it
but
my
house
is
full
now
i
ai
got
no
room
it
sold
for
twelve
cents
arthur
helps
says
that
human
nature
craves
nay
i
enjoys
tragedy
and
when
away
from
dramatic
representation
of
crime
and
horrors
and
sudden
death
as
in
this
quiet
country
life
the
people
gratify
their
needs
in
the
sorrows
sins
and
calamities
that
befall
their
neighbors
i
strongly
incline
to
hawthorne
idea
that
furniture
becomes
magnetized
permeated
so
that
the
chairs
sofas
and
tables
that
have
outlived
their
dear
owners
in
my
own
family
have
almost
a
sacred
value
to
me
still
why
moralize
estates
must
be
settled
and
auctions
are
a
blessing
in
disguise
of
course
buying
so
much
by
substitutes
i
amassed
a
lot
of
curious
things
of
which
i
did
not
know
the
use
or
value
and
therefore
greatly
enjoyed
the
experience
of
the
spectator
as
given
in
the
christian
union
he
attended
an
auction
with
the
following
result
a
long
table
was
covered
with
china
earthenware
and
glass
and
the
mantel
beyond
a
narrow
shelf
quite
near
the
ceiling
glittered
with
a
tangled
maze
of
clean
brass
candlesticks
steel
snuffers
and
plated
trays
at
one
end
dangled
a
huge
warming
pan
and
on
the
wall
near
it
hung
a
bit
of
canvas
in
a
gilded
frame
from
which
the
portrait
had
as
utterly
faded
as
he
whom
it
represented
had
vanished
into
thin
air
it
was
a
strange
place
a
room
from
which
many
a
colonial
citizen
had
passed
to
take
a
stroll
upon
the
village
street
and
here
in
sad
confusion
to
be
sure
the
dishes
that
graced
his
breakfast
table
the
spectator
could
have
lingered
there
if
alone
for
half
a
day
but
not
willingly
for
half
an
hour
in
such
a
crowd
the
crowd
however
closed
every
exit
and
he
had
to
submit
a
possible
chance
to
secure
some
odd
bit
was
his
only
consolation
why
the
good
old
soul
who
last
occupied
the
house
and
who
was
born
in
it
fourscore
years
ago
should
necessarily
have
had
only
her
grandmother
tableware
why
every
generation
of
this
family
should
have
suffered
no
losses
by
breakage
was
not
asked
every
bit
even
to
prizes
of
green
and
greasy
glass
antedated
the
revolution
and
the
wise
and
mighty
of
smalltown
knew
no
better
a
bit
of
egg
shell
sticking
to
a
cracked
teacup
was
stolen
as
a
relic
of
washington
last
breakfast
in
smalltown
while
china
was
passing
into
other
hands
the
spectator
made
a
discovery
a
curious
piece
of
polished
crooked
mahogany
was
seen
lying
between
soup
tureens
and
gravy
boats
he
picked
it
up
cautiously
fearing
to
attract
attention
and
with
one
eye
everywhere
else
scanned
it
closely
what
a
curious
he
thought
and
slyly
tucked
it
back
of
a
pile
of
plates
this
must
be
kept
track
of
it
may
prove
a
veritable
prize
but
all
his
care
went
for
naught
a
curious
old
lady
at
his
elbow
had
seen
every
action
is
it
she
asked
and
the
wooden
wonder
was
brought
to
light
an
wooden
butter
knife
i
seen
this
do
you
know
in
old
times
it
everybody
as
had
silver
and
mahogany
knives
for
butter
was
put
on
the
table
for
big
folks
we
folks
each
used
our
own
knife
all
this
was
dribbled
into
the
spectator
willing
ears
and
have
the
relic
he
would
at
any
cost
time
and
again
he
nervously
turned
it
over
to
be
sure
that
it
was
on
the
table
and
so
excited
another
curiosity
is
it
a
second
and
still
older
lady
asked
colonial
butter
knife
the
spectator
replied
with
an
air
of
much
antiquarian
lore
butter
knife
no
such
thing
my
grandfather
had
one
just
like
this
and
it
a
pruning
knife
he
would
use
a
steel
knife
because
it
poisoned
the
sap
what
next
paper
knife
butter
knife
and
pruning
knife
at
all
events
every
new
name
added
a
dollar
to
its
value
and
the
spectator
wondered
what
the
crowd
would
say
for
now
it
was
in
the
auctioneer
hands
he
looked
at
it
with
a
puzzled
expression
and
merely
cried
is
bid
for
i
this
his
ignorance
was
encouraging
it
started
at
a
dime
and
the
spectator
secured
it
for
a
quarter
for
a
moment
he
little
wondered
at
the
fascination
of
public
sales
the
past
was
forgiven
for
now
luck
had
turned
and
he
gloried
in
the
possession
of
a
prize
to
seek
the
outer
world
was
a
perilous
undertaking
for
fear
that
the
knife
might
come
to
grief
but
a
snug
harbor
was
reached
at
last
and
hugging
the
precious
bit
the
spectator
mysteriously
disappeared
on
reaching
his
home
no
one
must
know
of
his
success
until
the
mystery
was
cleaned
brightened
and
restored
to
pristine
beauty
the
spectator
rubbed
the
gummy
surface
with
kerosene
and
then
polished
it
with
flannel
then
warm
water
and
a
tooth
brush
were
brought
into
play
and
the
oil
all
removed
then
a
long
dry
polishing
and
the
restoration
was
complete
certainly
no
other
smalltowner
had
such
a
wooden
knife
and
it
was
indeed
beautiful
black
in
a
cross
light
red
in
direct
light
and
kaleidoscopic
by
gaslight
ah
such
a
prize
the
family
knew
that
something
strange
was
transpiring
but
what
no
one
had
an
inkling
they
must
wait
patiently
and
they
did
the
spectator
proudly
appeared
his
prize
in
hand
there
he
cried
in
triumph
and
they
all
looked
eagerly
and
when
the
spectator
pride
was
soaring
at
its
highest
a
younger
daughter
cried
papa
it
the
back
of
a
and
it
was
an
auctioneer
usually
tries
to
be
waggish
and
brisk
a
cross
between
a
street
peddler
and
a
circus
clown
with
a
hint
of
the
forced
mirth
of
the
speaker
occasionally
the
jokes
are
good
and
the
answers
from
the
audience
show
the
ready
yankee
wit
once
an
exceedingly
fat
man
too
obese
to
descend
from
his
high
wagon
bought
an
immense
dinner
bell
and
he
was
hit
unmercifully
a
rusty
old
elicited
many
remarks
as
no
flies
on
that
i
bought
several
chests
half
full
of
rubbish
but
found
alas
no
hidden
treasure
no
missing
jewels
no
money
hid
away
by
miserly
fingers
and
forgotten
jake
corey
who
was
doing
some
work
for
me
encouraged
me
to
hope
he
said
i
hear
ye
patronize
auctions
putty
sometimes
there
is
a
good
deal
to
be
made
that
way
and
then
there
is
i
never
had
no
luck
that
way
but
it
like
getting
married
it
a
lottery
folks
git
queer
and
put
money
in
some
spot
where
they
apt
to
forgit
all
about
it
now
i
knew
a
man
who
bought
an
old
hat
and
a
sight
of
other
stuff
jest
threw
in
the
hat
and
when
he
got
home
and
come
to
examine
it
ef

chapter
iii
buying
a
horse
and
you
know
this
deacon
elkins
to
be
a
thoroughly
reliable
man
in
every
respect
indeed
i
do
said
honest
nathan
robbins
he
is
the
very
soul
of
honor
could
do
a
mean
thing
i
trust
him
with
all
i
have
well
i
glad
to
hear
this
for
i
just
going
to
buy
a
horse
of
him
a
horse
yes
a
horse
then
i
do
know
anything
about
him
a
true
tale
after
furnishing
my
house
in
the
aforesaid
economical
and
nondescript
fashion
came
the
trials
of
planting
time
this
was
such
an
unfragrant
and
expensive
period
that
i
pass
over
it
as
briefly
as
possible
i
saw
it
was
necessary
in
conformity
with
the
appalling
situation
to
alter
one
vowel
in
my
manorial
hall
the
haul
altogether
amounted
to
eighteen
loads
besides
a
hundred
bags
of
vilely
smelling
fertilizers
agents
for
every
kind
of
phosphates
crowded
around
me
descanting
on
the
needs
of
the
old
land
until
i
began
to
comprehend
what
the
owner
meant
by
keeping
it
up
with
gail
hamilton
i
had
supposed
the
entire
land
of
this
earth
to
be
pretty
much
the
same
age
until
i
adopted
the
abandoned
this
i
found
was
fairly
senile
in
its
worthless
decrepitude
my
expenditure
was
something
prodigious
yes
planting
time
was
a
nightmare
in
broad
daylight
but
as
i
look
back
it
seems
a
rosy
dream
compared
with
the
prolonged
agonies
of
buying
a
horse
all
my
friends
said
i
must
have
a
horse
to
truly
enjoy
the
country
and
it
seemed
a
simple
matter
to
procure
an
animal
for
my
own
use
keepers
complaisant
and
cordial
were
continually
driving
around
the
corner
into
my
yard
with
a
tremendous
flourish
and
style
chirking
up
old
drawing
newly
painted
buggies
phaetons
democrats
high
wagons
low
chaises
just
for
me
to
try
they
all
said
that
seeing
i
was
a
lady
and
had
just
come
among
they
would
trade
easy
and
treat
me
well
each
mentioned
the
i
real
value
and
a
much
lower
price
at
which
i
as
a
special
favor
could
secure
the
entire
rig
their
prices
were
all
abominably
exorbitant
so
i
decided
to
hire
for
a
season
the
dozen
beasts
tried
in
two
months
if
placed
in
a
row
would
cure
the
worst
case
of
melancholia
some
shied
others
were
liable
to
be
overcome
by
blind
staggers
three
had
the
epizootic
badly
and
longed
to
lie
down
one
was
nearly
blind
at
last
i
was
told
of
a
lady
who
desired
to
leave
her
pet
horse
and
sargent
buggy
in
some
country
home
during
her
three
months
trip
abroad
both
were
so
highly
praised
as
i
just
the
thing
that
i
took
them
on
faith
i
judge
that
a
woman
can
lie
worse
than
a
man
about
a
horse
you
will
love
my
nellie
she
wrote
i
hate
to
part
with
her
even
for
the
summer
she
has
been
a
famous
racer
in
canada
can
travel
easily
miles
a
day
will
go
better
at
the
end
of
the
journey
than
at
the
beginning
i
hear
you
are
an
accomplished
driver
so
i
send
my
pet
to
your
care
without
anxiety
i
sent
a
man
to
her
home
to
drive
out
with
this
delightful
treasure
and
pictured
myself
taking
long
and
daily
drives
over
our
excellent
country
roads
nellie
i
dear
nellie
i
loved
her
already
how
i
would
pet
her
and
how
fond
she
would
become
of
me
two
lumps
of
sugar
at
least
every
day
for
her
and
red
ribbons
for
the
whip
how
she
would
dash
along
a
horse
for
me
at
last
about
of
the
next
day
a
carriage
was
heard
slowly
entering
the
yard
i
could
hardly
wait
until
morning
to
gloat
over
my
gentle
racer
at
early
dawn
i
visited
the
stable
and
found
john
disgusted
beyond
measure
with
my
bargain
a
rickety
carriage
with
wobbling
wheels
and
an
equally
thin
dejected
venerable
animal
with
an
immense
blood
spavin
on
left
hind
leg
recently
blistered
it
took
three
weeks
of
constant
doctoring
investment
in
kendall
spavin
cure
and
consultation
with
an
expensive
veterinary
surgeon
to
get
the
whilom
race
horse
into
a
condition
to
slowly
walk
to
market
i
understood
now
the
force
of
the
one
truthful
clause
she
will
go
better
at
the
end
of
the
drive
than
at
the
beginning
for
it
was
impossible
to
get
her
stiff
legs
started
without
a
fire
kindled
under
them
and
a
measure
of
oats
held
enticingly
before
her
it
was
enraging
but
nothing
to
after
experiences
all
the
disappointed
livery
men
their
complaisance
and
cordiality
wholly
a
thing
of
the
past
were
jubilant
that
i
had
been
so
imposed
upon
by
some
one
even
if
they
had
failed
and
their
looks
as
they
wheeled
rapidly
by
me
as
i
crept
along
with
the
poor
suffering
limping
nellie
were
almost
more
than
i
could
endure
horses
were
again
brought
for
inspection
and
there
was
a
repetition
of
previous
horrors
at
last
a
man
came
from
mossgrown
he
had
an
honest
face
he
knew
of
a
man
who
knew
of
a
man
whose
brother
had
just
i
the
horse
for
me
sound
stylish
kind
gentle
as
a
lamb
fast
as
the
wind
profiting
by
experience
i
said
i
would
look
at
it
next
day
a
young
man
gawky
and
seemingly
unsophisticated
brought
the
animal
it
looked
well
enough
and
i
was
so
tired
he
was
anxious
to
sell
but
only
because
he
was
going
to
be
married
and
go
west
needed
money
and
he
said
with
sweet
simplicity
now
i
ai
no
jockey
i
ai
you
need
be
afeard
of
me
i
say
just
what
i
mean
i
want
spot
cash
i
do
and
you
can
have
horse
carriage
and
harness
for
down
he
gave
me
a
short
drive
and
we
did
go
like
the
wind
i
thought
the
steed
very
hard
to
hold
in
but
he
convinced
me
that
it
was
not
so
i
decided
to
take
the
creature
a
week
on
trial
which
was
a
blow
to
that
guileless
young
man
and
that
very
afternoon
i
started
for
the
long
pleasant
drive
i
had
been
dreaming
about
since
early
spring
the
horse
looked
quiet
enough
but
i
concluded
to
take
my
german
domestic
along
for
extra
safety
i
remembered
his
drawling
direction
doa
pull
up
the
reins
unless
you
want
him
to
go
pretty
lively
so
held
the
reins
rather
loosely
for
a
moment
only
for
this
last
hope
wheeled
round
the
corner
as
if
possessed
and
after
trotting
then
breaking
then
darting
madly
from
side
to
side
started
into
a
full
run
i
pulled
with
all
my
might
gusta
stood
up
and
helped
no
avail
on
we
rushed
to
sudden
death
no
one
in
sight
anywhere
with
one
herculean
effort
bred
of
the
wildest
despair
we
managed
to
rein
him
in
at
a
sharp
right
angle
and
we
succeeded
in
calming
his
fury
and
tied
the
panting
trembling
fiend
to
a
post
then
gusta
mounted
guard
while
i
walked
home
in
the
heat
and
dirt
fully
half
a
mile
to
summon
john
i
learned
that
i
that
horse
had
never
before
been
driven
by
a
woman
he
evidently
was
not
pleased
soon
the
following
appeared
among
the
local
items
of
interest
in
the
gooseville
clarion
uriel
snooks
who
has
been
working
in
the
cheese
factory
at
frogville
is
now
to
preside
over
chair
number
four
in
tonsorial
establishment
on
main
street
kate
sanborn
is
trying
another
horse
these
bits
of
information
in
the
papers
were
a
boon
to
the
various
reporters
but
most
annoying
to
me
the
bungtown
gazetteer
announced
that
a
boston
poetess
had
purchased
the
britton
farm
and
was
fitting
up
the
old
homestead
for
city
boarders
i
could
import
a
few
hens
invest
in
a
new
dog
or
order
a
lawn
mower
but
a
full
account
would
grace
the
next
issue
of
all
the
weeklies
i
sympathized
with
the
old
woman
who
exclaimed
in
desperation
great
jerusalem
i
stir
without
some
feller
fur
at
last
i
suspected
the
itinerant
butcher
of
doing
double
duty
as
a
reporter
and
found
that
he
was
engaged
by
several
editors
to
pick
up
bits
of
news
for
the
press
as
he
went
his
daily
rounds
but
this
i
exclaimed
is
just
what
i
do
want
and
ca
allow
now
if
you
should
drive
in
here
some
day
and
discover
me
dead
reclining
against
yonder
noble
elm
or
stark
at
its
base
surrounded
by
my
various
pets
allude
to
it
in
the
most
indirect
way
i
prefer
the
funeral
to
be
strictly
private
moreover
if
i
notice
another
about
me
buy
of
your
rival
and
the
trouble
ceased
but
the
horses
still
they
came
and
went
i
used
to
pay
my
friend
the
rubicund
surgeon
to
test
some
of
these
highly
recommended
animals
in
a
short
drive
with
me
one
pronounced
absolutely
unrivaled
was
discovered
by
my
wise
mentor
to
be
with
a
swollen
gland
on
the
neck
would
shy
at
a
stone
stand
on
hind
legs
for
a
train
with
various
other
minor
defects
i
grew
fainthearted
discouraged
cynical
bitter
was
there
no
horse
for
me
i
became
as
a
drefful
fussy
old
maid
who
did
know
her
own
mind
and
could
be
suited
i
no
way
i
remember
one
horse
brought
by
a
butcher
from
west
bungtown
it
was
in
the
vernacular
a
with
ribs
so
prominent
they
suggested
a
the
two
fore
legs
were
well
bent
out
at
the
knees
both
hind
legs
were
swelled
near
the
hoofs
his
ears
nearly
as
large
as
a
donkey
one
eye
covered
with
a
cataract
the
other
deeply
sunken
a
roman
nose
accentuated
by
a
wide
stripe
aided
the
pensive
expression
of
his
drooping
under
lip
he
leaned
against
the
shafts
as
if
he
were
tired
there
marm
said
the
owner
eying
my
face
as
an
amused
expression
stole
over
it
ef
you
do
care
for
i
style
ef
ye
want
a
good
steddy
critter
and
a
critter
that
can
i
go
and
a
critter
that
i
any
lady
can
drive
i
there
the
critter
for
ye
i
did
buy
at
last
for
life
had
become
a
burden
an
i
interested
neighbor
who
really
pitied
me
induced
me
to
buy
a
pretty
little
black
horse
i
named
him
after
a
week
i
changed
to
after
he
had
run
away
and
no
one
would
buy
him
at
last
i
succeeded
in
exchanging
this
shying
and
dangerous
creature
for
a
melancholy
overworked
mare
at
a
livery
stable
i
hear
that
has
since
killed
two
i

by
throwing
them
out
when
not
sufficiently
inebriated
to
fall
against
rocks
with
safety
and
my
latest
venture
is
a
i
backer
horses
have
just
as
many
disagreeable
traits
just
as
much
individuality
in
their
badness
as
human
beings
under
kind
treatment
daily
petting
and
generous
feeding
dolly
is
too
frisky
and
headstrong
for
a
lady
to
drive
sell
that
treacherous
beast
at
once
or
you
will
be
killed
writes
an
anxious
friend
who
had
a
slight
acquaintance
with
her
moods
i
want
now
to
find
an
equine
reliance
whose
motto
is
nulla
vestigia
retrorsum
or
no
steps
backward
i
have
pasted
hale
famous
motto

forward
and
not

over
her
stall

with
no
effect

yell
for

the

going
on

the

robert
roosevelt
in
his
amusing
book
five
acres
too
much
gives
even
a
more
tragic
picture
saying
my
experience
of
horseflesh
has
been
various
and
instructive
i
have
been
thrown
over
their
heads
and
slid
over
their
tails
have
been
dragged
by
saddle
stirrups
and
tossed
out
of
wagons
i
have
had
them
to
back
and
to
kick
to
run
and
to
bolt
to
stand
on
their
hind
feet
and
kick
with
their
front
and
then
reciprocate
by
standing
on
their
front
and
kicking
with
their
hind
feet
i
have
been
thrown
much
with
horses
and
more
by
them
horses
are
the
most
miserable
creatures
invariably
doing
precisely
what
they
ought
not
to
do

pest
a
nuisance
a
bore
or
as
some
one
else

chapter
iv
for
those
who
love
pets
all
were
loved
and
all
were
regretted
but
life
is
made
up
of
forgetting
the
best
thing
which
a
man
possesses
is
his
dog
when
i
saw
a
man
driving
into
my
yard
after
this
i
would
dart
out
of
a
back
door
and
flee
to
sweet
communion
with
my
cows
on
one
such
occasion
i
shouted
back
that
i
did
not
want
a
horse
of
any
variety
could
not
engage
any
fruit
trees
did
not
want
the
place
photographed
and
was
just
going
out
to
spend
the
day
i
was
courteously
but
firmly
informed
that
my
latest
visitor
had
singular
to
relate
no
horse
to
dispose
of
but
he
would
like
fourteen
dollars
for
my
dog
tax
for
the
current
year
as
he
was
also
sheriff
constable
and
justice
of
the
peace
i
did
not
think
it
worth
while
to
argue
the
question
although
i
had
no
more
thought
of
being
called
up
to
pay
a
dog
tax
than
a
hen
tax
or
cat
tax
i
trembled
lest
i
should
be
obliged
to
enumerate
my
entire
menagerie
cats
dogs
canaries
rabbits
pigs
ducks
geese
hens
turkeys
pigeons
peacocks
cows
and
horses
each
kind
deserves
an
entire
chapter
and
how
easy
it
would
be
to
write
of
cats
and
their
admirers
from
cambyses
to
warner
of
dogs
and
their
friends
from
ulysses
to
bismarck
i
agree
with
ik
marvel
that
a
cat
is
like
a
politician
sly
and
diplomatic
purring
for
food
and
affectionate
for
a
consideration
really
caring
nothing
for
friendship
and
devotion
except
as
means
to
an
end
those
who
write
books
and
articles
and
verse
and
prose
tributes
to
cats
think
very
differently
but
the
cats
i
have
met
have
been
of
this
type
and
dogs
are
they
really
so
affectionate
or
are
they
also
a
little
shrewd
in
licking
the
hand
that
feeds
them
i
dislike
to
be
pessimistic
but
when
my
dogs
come
bounding
to
meet
me
for
a
jolly
morning
greeting
they
do
seem
expectant
and
hungry
rather
than
affectionate
at
other
hours
of
the
day
they
plead
with
loving
eyes
and
wagging
tails
for
a
walk
or
a
seat
in
the
carriage
or
permission
to
follow
the
wagon
but
i
will
not
analyze
their
motives
they
fill
the
house
and
grounds
with
life
and
frolic
and
a
farm
would
be
incomplete
if
they
were
missing
hamerton
in
speaking
of
the
one
dog
the
special
pet
and
dear
companion
of
one
youth
observes
that
the
comparative
shortness
of
the
lives
of
dogs
is
the
only
imperfection
in
the
relation
between
them
and
us
if
they
had
lived
to
and
ten
man
and
dog
might
have
traveled
through
life
together
but
as
it
is
we
must
either
have
a
succession
of
affections
or
else
when
the
first
is
buried
in
its
early
grave
live
in
a
chill
condition
of
i
thank
him
for
that
expressive
compound
word

every
one
might
like

and

write
a
history
of
my
pets
and
make
a
readable
book
carlyle
the
grand
old
growler
was
actually
attached
to
a
little
white
dog
his
wife
special
delight
for
whom
she
used
to
write
cute
little
notes
to
the
master
and
when
he
met
with
a
fatal
accident
he
was
tenderly
nursed
by
both
for
months
and
when
the
doctor
was
at
last
obliged
to
put
him
out
of
pain
by
prussic
acid
their
grief
was
sincere
they
buried
him
at
the
top
of
the
garden
in
cheyne
row
and
planted
cowslips
round
his
grave
and
his
mistress
placed
a
stone
tablet
with
name
and
date
to
mark
the
last
resting
place
of
her
blessed
dog
i
could
not
have
believed
writes
carlyle
in
the
memorials
my
grief
then
and
since
would
have
been
the
twentieth
part
of
what
it
was
nay
that
the
want
of
him
would
have
been
to
me
other
than
a
riddance
our
last
midnight
walk
together
for
he
insisted
on
trying
to
come
january
is
still
painful
to
my
thought
little
dim
white
speck
of
life
of
love
of
fidelity
girdled
by
the
darkness
of
night
eternal
beecher
said
many
a
good
thing
about
dogs
but
i
like
this
best
speaking
of
horseback
riding
he
incidentally
remarked
that
in
evolution
the
human
door
was
just
shut
upon
the
horse
but
the
dog
got
fully
up
before
the
door
was
shut
if
there
was
not
reason
mirthfulness
love
honor
and
fidelity
in
a
dog
he
did
not
know
where
to
look
for
it
oh
if
they
only
could
speak
what
wise
and
humorous
and
sarcastic
things
they
would
say
did
you
never
feel
snubbed
by
an
immense
dog
you
had
tried
to
patronize
and
i
have
seen
many
a
dog
smile
bayard
taylor
says
i
know
of
nothing
more
moving
indeed
than
the
yearning
helplessness
in
the
face
of
a
dog
who
understands
what
is
said
to
him
and
can
not
answer
holland
wrote
a
poem
to
his
dog
blanco
his
dear
dumb
friend
in
which
he
expresses
what
we
all
have
felt
many
times
i
look
into
your
great
brown
eyes
where
love
and
loyal
homage
shine
and
wonder
where
the
difference
lies
between
your
soul
and
mine
the
whole
poem
is
one
of
the
best
things
holland
ever
did
in
rhyme
he
was
ambitious
to
be
remembered
as
a
poet
but
he
never
excelled
in
verse
unless
he
had
something
to
express
that
was
very
near
his
heart
he
was
emphatically
the
apostle
of
common
sense
how
beautifully
he
closes
his
loving
tribute
ah
blanco
did
i
worship
god
as
truly
as
you
worship
me
or
follow
where
my
master
trod
with
your
humility
did
i
sit
fondly
at
his
feet
as
you
dear
blanco
sit
at
mine
and
watch
him
with
a
love
as
sweet
my
life
would
grow
divine
almost
all
our
great
men
have
more
than
one
dog
in
their
homes
when
i
spent
a
day
with
the
quaker
poet
at
danvers
i
found
he
had
three
dogs
roger
williams
a
fine
newfoundland
stood
on
the
piazza
with
the
questioning
patronizing
air
of
a
dignified
host
a
scotch
terrier
charles
dickens
peered
at
us
from
the
window
as
if
glad
of
a
little
excitement
while
carl
the
graceful
greyhound
was
indolently
coiled
up
on
a
shawl
and
took
little
notice
of
us
whittier
has
also
a
pet
cow
favorite
and
favored
which
puts
up
her
handsome
head
for
an
expected
caress
the
kindly
hearted
old
poet
so
full
of
tenderness
for
all
created
things
told
me
that
years
when
nuts
were
scarce
he
would
put
beech
nuts
and
acorns
here
and
there
as
he
walked
over
his
farm
to
cheer
the
squirrels
by
an
unexpected
find
miss
mitford
tribute
to
her
defunct
doggie
shows
to
what
a
degree
of
imbecility
an
old
maid
may
carry
fondness
for
her
pets
but
it
is
pathetically
amusing
my
own
darling
mossy
hair
cut
off
after
he
was
dead
by
dear
drum
august
he
was
the
greatest
darling
that
ever
lived
son
of
maria
and
webb
a
famous
dog
given
him
by
lord
rivers
and
was
when
he
died
about
seven
or
eight
years
old
he
was
a
large
black
dog
of
the
largest
and
strongest
kind
of
greyhounds
very
fast
and
honest
and
resolute
past
example
an
excellent
killer
of
hares
and
a
most
magnificent
and
creature
his
coat
was
of
the
finest
and
most
glossy
black
with
no
white
except
a
very
little
under
his
feet
pretty
white
shoe
linings
i
used
to
call
them
a
little
beautiful
white
spot
quite
small
in
the
very
middle
of
his
neck
between
his
chin
and
his
breast
and
a
white
mark
on
his
bosom
his
face
was
singularly
beautiful
the
finest
black
eyes
very
bright
and
yet
sweet
and
fond
and
tender
eyes
that
seemed
to
speak
a
beautiful
complacent
mouth
which
used
sometimes
to
show
one
of
the
long
white
teeth
at
the
side
a
jet
black
nose
a
brow
which
was
bent
and
flexible
like
fox
and
gave
great
sweetness
and
expression
and
a
look
of
thought
to
his
dear
face
there
never
was
such
a
dog
his
temper
was
beyond
comparison
the
sweetest
ever
known
nobody
ever
saw
him
out
of
humor
and
his
sagacity
was
equal
to
his
temper
thank
god
he
went
off
without
suffering
he
must
have
died
in
a
moment
i
thought
i
should
have
broken
my
heart
when
i
came
home
and
found
what
had
happened
i
shall
miss
him
every
moment
of
my
life
i
have
missed
him
every
instant
so
have
drum
and
granny
he
was
laid
out
last
night
in
the
stable
and
this
morning
we
buried
him
in
the
middle
plantation
on
the
house
side
of
the
fence
in
the
flowery
corner
between
the
fence
and
lord
shrewsbury
fields
we
covered
his
dear
body
with
flowers
every
flower
in
the
garden
i
everybody
loved
him
saint
as
i
used
to
call
him
and
as
i
i
do
not
doubt
he
now
is
no
human
being
was
ever
so
faithful
so
gentle
so
generous
and
so
fond
i
shall
never
love
anything
half
so
well
it
will
always
be
pleasant
to
me
to
remember
that
i
never
teased
him
by
petting
other
things
and
that
everything
i
had
he
shared
he
always
ate
half
my
breakfast
and
the
very
day
before
he
died
i
fed
him
i
all
the
morning
with
filberts
there
may
have
been
a
connection
between
the
filberts
and
the
funeral
while
i
had
him
i
was
always
sure
of
having
one
who
would
love
me
alike
in
riches
or
poverty
who
always
looked
at
me
with
looks
of
the
fondest
love
always
faithful
and
always
kind
to
think
of
him
was
a
talisman
against
vexing
thoughts
a
thousand
times
i
have
said
want
my
mossy
when
that
dear
mossy
was
close
by
and
would
put
his
dear
black
nose
under
my
hand
on
hearing
his
name
god
bless
you
my
mossy
i
cried
when
you
died
and
i
can
hardly
help
crying
whenever
i
think
of
you
all
who
loved
me
loved
mossy
he
had
the
most
perfect
confidence
in
me
always
came
to
me
for
protection
against
any
one
who
threatened
him
and
thank
god
always
found
it
i
value
all
things
he
had
lately
or
ever
touched
even
the
old
quilt
that
used
to
be
spread
on
my
bed
for
him
to
lie
on
and
which
we
called
mossy
quilt
and
the
pan
that
he
used
to
drink
out
of
in
the
parlor
and
which
was
always
called
pan
dear
darling
i
forgot
to
say
that
his
breath
was
always
sweet
and
balmy
his
coat
always
glossy
like
satin
and
he
never
had
any
disease
or
anything
to
make
him
disagreeable
in
his
life
many
other
things
i
have
omitted
and
so
i
should
if
i
were
to
write
a
whole
volume
of

chapter
starting
a
poultry
farm
if
every
hen
should
only
raise
five
broods
yearly
of
ten
each
and
there
were
ten
hens
to
start
with
at
the
end
of
two
years
they
would
number
after
the
superfluous
roosters
were
sold
and
then
supposing
the
extra
eggs
to
have
paid
for
their
keeping
and
the
produce
to
be
worth
only
a
dollar
and
a
half
a
pair
there
would
be
a
clear
profit
of
allowing
for
occasional
deaths
this
sum
might
be
stated
in
round
numbers
at
a
quarter
of
a
million
which
would
be
a
liberal
increase
from
ten
hens
of
course
i
did
not
expect
to
do
as
well
as
this
but
merely
mention
what
might
be
done
with
good
luck
and
forcing
robert
roosevelt
having
always
heard
on
the
best
authority
that
there
was
money
in
hens
i
invested
largely
in
prize
fowls
secured
at
state
fairs
and
large
poultry
shows
buying
as
many
kinds
as
possible
to
make
an
effective
and
brilliant
display
in
their
runs
there
i
is
a
good
deal
of
money
in
my
hens
how
to
get
it
back
is
the
present
problem
these
hens
were
all
heralded
as
famous
layers
several
did
lay
in
the
traveling
coops
on
the
journey
great
beauties
just
to
show
what
they
could
do
if
they
chose
then
stopped
suddenly
i
wrote
anxiously
to
former
owners
of
this
vaunted
stock
to
explain
such
disappointing
behavior
some
guessed
the
hens
were
just
moulting
others
thought
may
be
they
were
broody
a
few
had
the
frankness
to
agree
with
me
that
it
was
mighty
curious
but
hens
always
were
sorter
contrary
critters
their
appetites
remained
normal
but
as
the
little
girl
said
of
her
pet
bantam
they
only
lay
about
doing
nothing
and
when
guests
desired
some
of
my
fine
fresh
eggs
boiled
for
breakfast
i
used
to
go
secretly
to
a
neighbor
and
buy
a
dozen
but
never
gave
away
the
mortifying
situation
seeing
piles
of
ducks
eggs
in
a
farmer
barn
all
packed
for
market
and
picturing
the
producers
thirty
white
pekins
a
snowy
fleet
on
my
reformed
lakelet
i
bought
the
whole
lot
and
for
long
weary
months
they
were
fed
and
pampered
and
coaxed
and
reasoned
with
shut
up
let
out
kept
on
the
water
forbidden
to
go
to
it
but
not
one
egg
to
be
seen
it
was
considered
a
rich
joke
in
that
locality
that
a
city
woman
who
was
trying
to
farm
had
applied
for
these
ducks
just
as
they
had
completed
their
labors
for
the
season
of
they
were
also
extremely
venerable
and
the
reticent
owner
rejoiced
to
be
relieved
of
an
expensive
burden
at
good
rates
knowing
nothing
of
these
facts
in
natural
history
i
pondered
deeply
over
the
double
phenomenon
i
said
the
hens
seemed
normal
only
as
to
appetite
the
ducks
proved
abnormal
in
this
respect
they
were
always
coming
up
to
the
back
door
clamoring
for
food
always
unappeased
they
preferred
cake
fresh
bread
hot
boiled
potatoes
doted
on
tender
bits
of
meat
but
would
gobble
up
anything
and
everything
more
voracious
and
less
fastidious
than
the
ordinary
hog
of
commerce
bags
of
corn
were
consumed
in
a
flash
shorts
were
never
long
before
their
eager
gaze
they
went
for
every
kind
of
nourishment
provided
for
the
rest
of
the
menagerie
a
goat
is
supposed
to
have
a
champion
appetite
and
digestion
but
a
duck
at
least
one
of
my
ducks
leaves
a
goat
so
far
behind
that
he
never
could
regain
his
reputation
for
omniverosity
they
were
too
antique
to
be
eaten
themselves
their
longevity
entitled
them
to
respect
they
could
not
be
disposed
of
by
the
shrewdest
market
man
to
the
least
particular
of
providers
i
could
only
regard
them
with
amazement
and
horror
and
let
them
go
on
eating
me
out
of
house
and
home
and
but
at
last
i
knew
i
asked
an
honest
man
from
afar
who
called
to
sell
something
why
those
ducks
would
not
lay
a
single
egg
he
looked
at
them
critically
and
wrote
to
me
the
next
day
dear
madam
the
reason
your
ducks
wo
lay
is
because
they
too
old
to
live
and
the
bigest
part
of
is
drakes
respectfully
jonas
hurlbert
i
hear
that
there
are
more
ducks
in
the
chinese
empire
than
in
all
the
world
outside
of
it
they
are
kept
by
the
celestials
on
every
farm
on
the
private
and
public
roads
on
streets
of
cities
and
on
all
the
lakes
ponds
rivers
streams
and
brooks
in
the
country
that
is
the
secret
of
their
lack
of
progress
what
time
have
they
to
advance
after
the
ducks
are
fed
and
cared
for
no
male
inhabitant
could
ever
squeeze
out
a
leisure
to
visit
a
barber
hence
their
long
queues
about
this
time
the
statement
of
crankin
of
north
yeaston
rhode
island
that
he
makes
a
clear
and
easy
profit
of
five
dollars
and
twenty
cents
per
hen
each
year
and
nearly
dollars
to
every
duck
and
might
have
increased
said
profit
if
he
had
hatched
rather
than
sold
dozen
eggs
struck
me
as
wildly
apocryphal
also
that
caring
for
said
hens
and
ducks
was
merely
an
incident
of
his
day
work
on
the
large
farm
he
working
with
his
laborers
and
indignant
contrasting
his
rosy
success
with
my
failure
i
decided
to
give
all
my
ducks
away
as
they
would
could
drown
and
there
would
be
no
use
in
killing
them
but
no
one
wanted
them
and
everybody
smiled
quizzically
when
i
proposed
the
gift
just
then
as
if
in
direct
sarcasm
a
friend
sent
me
a
paper
with
an
item
marked
to
the
effect
that
a
poor
young
girl
had
three
ducks
eggs
given
her
as
the
basis
of
a
solid
fortune
and
actually
cleared
one
hundred
and
eighteen
dollars
from
those
three
eggs
the
first
year
another
woman
solemnly
asserts
in
print
a
profit
of
from
one
hundred
hens
each
year
the
census
man
told
me
of
a
woman
who
had
only
eighteen
hens
they
gave
her
sixteen
hundred
and
ninety
eggs
of
which
she
sold
eighteen
worth
leaving
plenty
for
household
use
and
my
hens
and
my
ducks
in
my
despair
i
drove
a
long
way
to
consult
a
duck
man
he
looked
like
the
typical
brother
jonathan
only
with
a
longer
beard
and
his
face
was
haggard
unkempt
anxious
he
could
scarcely
stop
to
converse
evidently
grudged
the
time
devotes
his
entire
energies
from
dawn
to
twilight
to
slaving
for
his
eight
hundred
ducklings
he
also
kept
an
incubator
going
all
the
time
do
ducks
pay
you
i
asked
wall
i
gettin
to
be
somewhat
of
a
bigotist
he
said
i
barely
git
a
livin
why
crankin
i
began
the
name
roused
his
jealous
ire
and
his
voice
a
low
mumble
before
now
burst
into
a
loud
roar
yes
crankin
makes
money
has
a
sight
incubators
makes
himself
sells
a
lot
but
some
say
they
do
act
like
his
do
when
they
git
off
his
place
most
on
seem
possessed
but
crankin
i
he
can
manage
and
makes
money
too
do
your
ducks
lay
much
lay
i
do
want
to
lay
sell
all
out
at
nine
weeks
the
pin
feathers
come
then
they
good
eatin
for
them
as
likes
heard
of
yure
old
lot
kill
i
say
and
start
new
crankin
says
i
do
care
nothing
what
crankin
says
here
the
voice
would
have
filled
a
cathedral
i
tell
ye
me
and
crankin
two
different
critters
so
i
felt
but
it
would
not
do
to
give
up
i
purchased
an
expensive
incubator
and
brooder
need
have
bought
a
brooder
i
put
into
the
incubator
at
a
time
when
eggs
were
scarce
and
high
priced
two
hundred
eggs
hens
eggs
ducks
eggs
goose
eggs
the
temperature
must
be
kept
from
to
the
lamps
blazed
up
a
little
on
the
first
day
but
after
that
we
kept
the
heat
exactly
right
by
daily
watching
and
night
vigils
it
engrossed
most
of
the
time
of
four
victims
nothing
ever
was
developed
the
eggs
were
probably
cooked
that
first
day
now
i
vainly
seeking
for
a
purchaser
for
my
and
b
terms
of
sale
very
reasonable
great
reduction
from
original
price
shall
no
doubt
be
forced
to
give
them
away
to
banish
painful
recollections
i
also
invested
in
turkeys
geese
and
peacocks
and
a
pair
of
guinea
hens
to
keep
hawks
away
for
long
weary
months
the
geese
seemed
the
only
fowls
truly
at
home
on
my
farm
they
did
their
level
best
satisfied
that
my
hens
would
neither
lay
nor
set
i
sent
to
noted
poultry
fanciers
for
settings
of
eggs
at
three
dollars
per
thirteen
then
paid
a
friendly
hen
woman
for
assisting
in
the
mysterious
evolution
of
said
eggs
into
various
interesting
little
families
old
enough
to
be
brought
to
me
many
and
curious
were
the
casualties
befalling
these
young
broods
chickens
are
subject
to
all
the
infantile
diseases
of
children
and
many
more
of
their
own
and
mine
were
truly
afflicted
i
imprimis
most
would
not
hatch
the
finest
brahma
eggs
contained
the
commonest
fowls
some
stuck
to
the
shell
some
were
drowned
in
a
saucer
of
milk
some
perished
because
no
lard
had
been
rubbed
on
their
heads
others
passed
away
discouraged
by
too
much
lard
several
ate
rose
bugs
with
fatal
results
others
were
greedy
as
to
gravel
and
agonized
with
distended
crops
till
released
by
death
they
had
more
sand
than
was
good
for
them
they
were
raised
on
cat
hill
and
five
were
captured
by
felines
and
when
the
remnant
was
brought
to
me
they
disappeared
day
by
day
in
the
most
puzzling
manner
until
we
caught
our
mischievous
pug
tiny
tim
holding
down
a
beautiful
young
leghorn
with
his
cruel
paw
and
biting
a
piece
out
of
her
neck
so
they
left
me
one
by
one
like
the
illusions
of
youth
until
there
was
no
survival
of
the
fittest
in
a
ragged
old
barn
opposite
a
hen
had
stolen
her
nest
and
brought
out
seventeen
vigorous
chicks
i
paid
a
large
bill
for
the
care
of
what
might
have
been
a
splendid
collection
and
meekly
bought
that
faithful
old
hen
with
her
large
family
it
is
now
a
wonder
to
me
that
any
chickens
arrive
at
maturity
fowls
are
afflicted
with
parasitic
wrigglers
in
their
poor
little
throats
the
disease
is
called
gapes
because
they
try
to
open
their
bills
for
more
air
until
a
red
worm
in
the
trachea
causes
suffocation
this
horrid
red
worm
called
scientifically
i
scelorostoma
syngamus
destroys
annually
i
half
a
million
of
chickens
dr
crisp
of
england
says
it
would
be
of
truly
national
importance
to
find
the
means
of
preventing
its
invasion
the
unpleasant
results
of
hens
and
garden
contiguous
warner
has
described
they
are
incompatible
if
not
antagonistic
one
man
wisely
advises
fence
the
garden
in
and
let
the
chickens
run
as
the
man
divided
the
house
with
his
quarrelsome
wife
by
taking
the
inside
himself
and
giving
her
the
outside
that
she
might
have
room
according
to
her
strength
looking
over
the
long
list
of
diseases
to
which
fowls
are
subject
is
dispiriting
i
am
glad
they
ca
read
them
or
they
would
have
all
at
once
as
jerome
the
witty
playwright
decided
he
had
every
disease
found
in
a
medical
dictionary
except
housemaid
knee
look
at
this
condensed
list
diseases
of
nervous
apoplexy
paralysis
vertigo
neuralgia
debility
diseases
of
digestive
diseases
of
locomotive
rheumatism
cramp
gout
leg
weakness
paralysis
of

elephantiasis
next
diseases
caused
by

then
injuries
lastly
miscellaneous
i
could
add
a
still
longer
list
of
unclassified
ills
homesickness
fits
melancholia
corns
blindness
from
fighting
too
much
etc
now
that
i
have
learned
to
raise
chickens
it
is
a
hard
and
slow
struggle
to
get
any
killed
i
say
in
an
manner
with
assumed
nonchalance
ellen
i
want
tom
to
kill
a
rooster
at
once
for
dinner
and
i
have
an
order
from
a
friend
for
four
more
so
he
must
select
five
then
begins
the
trouble
oh
pleads
ellen
do
kill
dear
dick
poor
dear
dick
that
is
tom
pet
of
all
so
big
and
handsome
and
knows
so
much
he
will
jump
up
on
tom
shoulder
and
eat
out
of
his
hand
and
come
when
he
calls
and
those
big
brahmas
you
know
how
they
were
brought
up
by
hand
as
you
might
say
and
they
know
me
and
hang
around
the
door
for
crumbs
and
that
beauty
of
a
wyandock
you
i
could
eat
i
him
when
the
matter
is
decided
as
the
guillotining
is
going
on
ellen
and
i
sit
listening
to
the
axe
thuds
and
the
death
squaks
while
she
wrings
her
hands
saying
o
dearie
me
what
a
world
the
dear
lord
ha
mercy
on
us
poor
creatures
what
a
thing
to
look
into
that
we
must
kill
the
poor
innocents
to
eat
them
and
they
were
so
tame
and
cunning
and
would
follow
me
all
around
then
i
tell
her
of
the
horrors
of
the
french
revolution
to
distract
her
attention
from
the
present
crisis
and
alluded
to
the
horrors
of
cannibalism
recently
disclosed
in
africa
then
i
fall
into
a
queer
reverie
and
imagine
how
awful
it
would
be
if
we
should
ever
be
called
to
submit
to
a
race
of
beings
as
much
larger
than
we
are
as
we
are
above
the
fowls
i
almost
hear
such
a
monster
of
a
fully
ninety
feet
high
say
to
a
servant
looking
sternly
and
critically
at
me
that
fat
white
creature

be
killed
just
eats
her
old

off

close
where
he
takes
a
drink
at
the
pump
for
ye
see
he
died
in
liquor
and
then
arter
he
squenched
hisself
wanishes
into
waper
then
there
the
ghost
of
old
beales
as
goes
o
nights
and
sows
tares
in
his
neighbor
wheat
i
often
seed
in
seed
time
they
do
say
that
black
ben
the
poacher
have
riz
and
what
more
walked
slap
through
all
the
squire
steel
traps
without
springing
on
and
then
there
bet
hawkey
as
murdered
her
own
infant
only
the
poor
little
babby
had
learned
to
walk
and
so
ca
appear
her
thomas
hood
i
the
grimsby
ghost
that
dark
little
room
i
described
as
so
convenient
during
a
terrific
thunderstorm
or
the
prowling
investigations
of
a
burglar
began
after
a
while
to
get
mysterious
and
uncanny
and
i
disliked
nay
dreaded
to
enter
it
after
dark
it
was
so
still
so
black
so
empty
so
chilly
with
a
sort
of
supernatural
chill
so
silent
that
imagination
conjured
up
sounds
such
as
i
had
never
heard
before
i
had
been
told
of
an
extremely
old
woman
a
peevish
and
who
had
occupied
that
room
for
nearly
a
score
of
years
apparently
forgotten
by
fate
and
left
to
drag
out
a
monotonous
weary
existence
on
not
her
mattress
grave
like
the
poet
heine
but
on
an
immensely
thick
feather
bed
only
a
care
a
burden
to
her
relations
as
twilight
came
on
i
always
carefully
closed
that
door
and
shut
the
old
lady
in
to
sleep
by
herself
for
it
seemed
that
she
was
still
there
still
propped
up
in
an
imaginary
bed
mumbling
incoherently
of
the
past
or
moaning
out
some
want
or
calling
for
some
one
to
bring
a
light
as
she
used
to
once
in
a
while
they
told
me
she
would
regain
her
strength
suddenly
and
astonish
the
family
by
appearing
at
the
door
when
the
was
enjoying
a
sunday
night
call
from
her
intended
it
was
rather
embarrassing
i
said
nothing
to
my
friends
about
this
unpleasant
room
but
several
were
susceptible
to
the
strange
influence
one
thought
she
should
not
mind
so
much
if
the
door
swung
open
and
a
i
portière
concealed
the
gloom
so
a
cheerful
cretonne
soon
was
hung
then
the
fancy
came
that
the
curtain
stirred
and
swayed
as
if
some
one
or
something
was
groping
feebly
with
ghostly
or
ghastly
fingers
behind
it
and
one
night
when
sitting
late
and
alone
over
the
embers
of
my
open
fire
feeling
a
little
forlorn
i
certainly
heard
moans
coming
from
that
direction
it
was
not
the
wind
for
although
it
was
late
october
and
the
breezes
were
sighing
over
summer
departure
this
sound
was
entirely
different
and
distinct
then
and
what
a
shiver
ran
down
my
back
i
remembered
hearing
that
a
woman
had
been
killed
by
falling
down
the
steep
cellar
stairs
and
the
spot
on
the
left
side
where
she
was
found
unconscious
and
bleeding
had
been
pointed
out
to
me
there
i
heard
it
again
was
it
the
wraith
of
the
aged
dame
or
the
cries
of
that
unfortunate
creature
hush
ellen
ca
have
fallen
down
i
am
really
scared
the
lamp
seems
to
be
burning
dim
and
the
last
coal
has
gone
out
is
it
some
restless
spirit
so
unhappy
that
it
must
moan
out
its
weary
plaint
i
ought
to
be
brave
and
go
at
once
and
look
boldly
down
the
cellar
stairs
and
draw
aside
that
waving
i
portière
oh
dear
if
i
only
had
some
one
to
go
with
me
and
hold
a
light
and
there
it
is
the
third
time
courage
vanished
it
might
be
some
dreadful
tramp
hiding
and
trying
to
drive
me
so
he
could
get
the
silver
and
he
would
gladly
murder
me
for
ten
cents
tom
i
cried
tom
come
here
but
tom
my
factotum
made
no
response
i
could
stand
it
no
longer
the
i
portière
seemed
fairly
alive
and
i
rushed
out
to
the
kitchen
where
ellen
sat
reading
the
i
ledger
deep
in
the
horrors
of
the
forsaken
inn
ellen
i
ashamed
but
i
really
frightened
i
do
believe
somebody
is
in
that
horrid
dark
room
or
in
the
cellar
and
where
i
is
tom
bedad
miss
and
you
frightened
the
heart
right
out
o
me
it
might
be
a
ghost
for
there
are
such
things
heaven
help
us
and
i
seen
in
this
country
and
in
dear
old
ireland
and
so
has
tom
you
seen
ghosts
yes
indeed
miss
but
i
never
spoke
to
any
for
you
no
right
to
speak
to
a
ghost
and
if
you
do
you
will
surely
die
tom
now
came
in
and
soon
satisfied
me
that
there
was
no
living
thing
in
the
darkness
so
i
sat
down
and
listened
to
ellen
experiences
with
ghosts
the
former
mrs
now
this
happened
in
new
york
city
miss
in
west
street
and
is
every
word
true
for
my
dear
i
saw
it
with
my
own
eyes
i
went
to
bed
about
nine
it
was
this
night
and
i
was
lying
quietly
in
bed
looking
up
to
the
ceiling
no
light
on
account
of
the
mosquitoes
and
maud
the
little
girl
i
was
caring
for
a
romping
dear
of
seven
or
eight
a
motherless
child
had
been
tossing
about
restless
like
and
her
arm
was
flung
over
me
all
at
once
i
saw
a
lady
standing
by
the
side
of
the
bed
in
her
night
dress
and
looking
earnestly
at
the
child
beyond
me
she
then
came
nearer
took
maud
arm
off
me
and
gently
straightened
her
in
bed
then
stroked
her
face
both
cheeks
fondly
you
know
and
then
stood
and
looked
at
the
child
i
said
not
a
word
but
i
was
one
bit
afraid
for
i
thought
it
was
a
living
lady
i
could
tell
the
color
of
her
eyes
and
hair
and
just
how
she
looked
every
way
in
the
morning
i
described
her
to
wilkes
and
asked
there
any
strange
lady
in
the
house
ellen
why
she
said
then
i
said
there
certainly
was
a
lady
in
my
room
last
night
in
her
night
dress
and
she
patted
maud
as
if
she
thought
a
sight
of
her
said
my
mistress
is
surely
the
former
mrs
wilkes
she
said
that
the
older
daughter
had
seen
her
several
times
standing
before
her
glass
fixing
her
hair
and
looking
at
herself
but
if
she
spoke
to
her
or
tried
to
speak
her
mother
would
take
up
something
and
shake
it
at
her
and
once
when
we
were
going
together
alice
screamed
and
said
that
her
mother
was
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
blew
her
cold
breath
right
down
on
her
the
stepmother
started
to
give
her
her
slipper
but
the
father
pitied
her
and
would
not
allow
her
to
be
whipped
and
said
go
up
to
bed
with
you
alice
did
you
ever
see
the
lady
in
white
again
ellen
never
nor
did
i
ever
see
any
other
ghost
in
this
country
that
i
was
sure
was
a
ghost
but

when
you
go
over
do
forget
my
native
place
it
has
a
real
castle
and
a
part
of
it
is
haunted
and
the
master
does
like
to
live
there
only
comes
once
a
year
or
so
for
hunting
and
the
rabbits
there
are
as
thick
as
they
can
be
and
the
river
chuck
full
of
fish
but
no
one
can
touch
any
game
or
even
take
out
one
fish
or
they
would
be
punished
yes
ellen
it
hard
and
all
wrong
but
we
are
wandering
away
from
your
ghosts
and
you
know
i
am
going
to
take
notes
so
begin
well
miss
i
was
a
sort
of
companion
or
maid
to
a
blind
lady
in
my
own
town
i
slept
in
a
little
room
just
across
the
landing
from
hers
so
as
to
always
be
within
reach
of
her
i
was
just
going
to
bed
when
she
called
for
me
to
come
in
and
see
if
there
was
something
in
the
room
something
alive
she
thought
that
had
been
hopping
hopping
all
around
her
bed
and
frightened
her
dreadfully
poor
thing
for
you
remember
she
was
stone
blind
miss
which
made
it
worse
so
i
hurried
in
and
i
shook
the
curtains
looked
behind
the
bureau
and
under
the
bed
and
tried
everywhere
for
whatever
might
be
hopping
around
but
could
find
nothing
and
heard
not
a
sound
while
i
was
there
all
was
still
then
i
went
into
my
room
again
and
left
the
door
open
as
i
thought
miss
lacy
would
feel
more
comfortable
about
it
and
i
was
hardly
in
my
bed
when
she
called
again
and
screamed
out
with
fear
for
it
was
hopping
round
the
bed
she
said
i
must
go
and
bring
a
candle
so
i
had
to
go
to
the
pantry
all
alone
and
get
the
candle
then
i
searched
as
before
but
found
nothing
not
a
thing
well
my
dear
i
went
into
my
room
and
kept
my
candle
lighted
this
time
the
third
time
she
called
me
she
was
standing
on
her
pillow
shivering
with
fright
and
begged
me
to
bring
the
light
it
was
sad
because
she
was
stone
blind
she
told
me
how
it
went
hopping
around
the
room
with
its
legs
tied
like
and
after
looking
once
more
and
finding
nothing
she
said
i
have
to
sleep
in
the
bed
with
her
and
bring
a
chair
near
the
bed
and
put
the
lighted
candle
on
it
for
a
long
time
we
kept
awake
and
watched
and
listened
but
nothing
happened
nothing
appeared
we
kept
awake
as
long
as
we
could
but
at
last
our
eyes
grew
very
heavy
and
the
lady
seemed
to
feel
more
easy
so
i
snuffed
out
the
candle
out
it
hopped
and
kept
a
jumping
on
one
leg
like
from
one
side
to
the
other
we
were
so
much
afraid
we
covered
our
faces
we
dreaded
to
see
it
so
we
hid
our
eyes
under
the
sheet
and
she
clung
on
to
me
all
shaking
she
felt
worse
because
she
was
blind
we
fell
asleep
at
daylight
and
when
i
told
monk
the
butler
he
said
it
was
a
corpse
sure
a
corpse
whose
legs
had
been
tied
to
keep
them
straight
and
the
cords
had
not
been
taken
off
the
feet
not
being
loosened
why
my
own
dear
mother
that
dead
many
a
year
heaven
bless
her
departed
spirit
she
would
never
tell
a
word
that
was
not
true
she
saw
a
ghost
hopping
in
that
way
jumping
around
a
bed
blue
as
a
blue
bag
just
after
the
third
day
she
was
buried
and
my
mother
the
lord
bless
her
soul
told
me
the
sons
went
to
her
grave
and
loosened
the
cords
and
she
never
came
back
any
more
is
it
awful
and
bedad
miss
it
every
word
true
i
can
tell
you
of
a
young
man
i
knew
who
looked
into
a
window
at
midnight
after
he
had
been
playing
cards
miss
gambling
with
the
other
boys
and
saw
something
awful
strange
and
was
turned
by
ghosts
into
a
i
shadow
this
seemed
to
be
a
thrilling
theme
such
as
hawthorne
would
have
been
able
to
weave
into
the
weirdest
of
weird
tales
and
i
said
go
on
well
he
used
to
go
playing
cards
about
three
miles
from
his
home
with
a
lot
of
young
men
for
his
mother
would
have
cards
played
in
her
house
and
she
thought
it
was
wicked
and
begged
him
not
to
play
it
a
habit
with
the
young
men
of
ireland
do
know
as
it
the
same
in
other
countries
and
they
play
for
a
goose
or
a
chicken
they
go
to
some
vacant
house
to
get
away
from
their
fathers
they
so
against
it
at
home
why
my
used
to
go
often
to
such
a
house
on
the
side
of
a
country
road
each
man
would
in
turn
provide
the
candles
to
play
by
and
as
this
house
was
said
to
be
haunted
bedad
they
had
it
all
to
themselves
well
this
last
night
that
ever
they
played
there
it
was
tom
own
brother
that
told
me
this
just
as
they
were
going
to
deal
the
cards
a
tall
gentleman
came
out
from
a
room
that
had
been
the
kitchen
he
walked
right
up
to
them
he
was
dressed
in
black
cloth
clothes
and
wore
a
high
black
hat
and
came
right
between
two
of
the
men
and
told
them
to
deal
out
the
cards
they
were
too
frightened
even
to
speak
so
the
stranger
took
the
cards
himself
and
dealt
around
to
each
man
and
afterward
he
played
with
them
then
he
looked
at
every
man
in
turn
and
walked
out
of
the
room
as
soon
as
he
cleared
out
of
the
place
the
men
all
went
away
as
quick
as
ever
they
could
and
stop
to
put
out
the
lights
each
man
cleared
with
himself
and
never
stopped
to
look
behind
and
no
one
cared
to
play
cards
in
that
house
afterward
any
more
that
was
tom
own
brother
and
now
the
poor
young
man
who
was
going
home
at
midnight
saw
a
light
in
one
of
the
houses
by
the
road
so
he
turned
toward
it
thinking
to
light
his
pipe
just
before
knocking
he
looked
in
at
the
window
as
soon
as
he
peeped
in
the
light
went
out
on
him
and
still
he
could
see
crowds
of
people
as
thick
as
grass
just
as
you
see
at
a
fair
so
thick
they
had
room
to
stand
and
they
kept
swaying
back
and
forth
courtesying
like
the
kitchen
was
full
and
looking
through
a
door
he
saw
a
lot
more
of
fine
ladies
and
gentlemen
they
were
laughing
and
having
great
fun
running
round
the
table
setting
out
cups
and
saucers
just
as
if
they
were
having
a
ball
just
then
a
big
fell
over
with
a
great
crash
and
all
the
fine
people
scampered
away
and
all
was
dark
so
he
turned
away
on
his
heel
and
was
so
frightened
his
mother
said
he
could
hardly
get
home
from
fear
and
he
had
three
whole
miles
to
go
next
day
he
was
thrashing
corn
in
the
barn
and
something
upset
him
and
pitched
him
head
foremost
across
the
flail
he
rose
and
three
times
he
was
pitched
like
that
across
the
flail
so
he
gave
up
and
went
home
his
mother
asked
him
what
is
the
matter
with
you
you
do
look
very
bad
so
he
up
and
told
her
what
had
happened
to
him
in
the
barn
and
what
he
saw
the
night
before
and
he
took
suddenly
sick
and
had
to
keep
his
bed
for
nine
weeks
and
when
he
got
up
and
was
walking
around
he
was
himself
any
more
and
the
sister
says
to
the
mother
i
sure
that
it
is
johnny
that
there
it
only
his
shadow
for
when
i
look
at
him
it
is
his
features
or
face
but
the
face
of
another
thing
he
used
to
be
so
pleasant
and
cheerful
but
now
he
looks
like
quite
another
man
mother
said
she
have
johnny
at
all
soon
he
got
a
little
stronger
and
went
to
the
capital
town
with
corn
several
other
men
went
also
to
get
their
corn
ground
they
were
all
coming
home
together
a
very
cold
night
and
the
men
got
up
and
sat
on
their
sacks
of
corn
the
other
horses
walked
on
all
right
with
them
but
johnny
horses
would
move
not
one
step
while
he
was
on
top
of
the
load
well
my
dear
he
called
for
the
rest
to
come
and
help
him
to
see
if
the
horses
would
go
for
them
but
they
would
not
move
one
step
though
they
whipped
them
and
shouted
at
them
to
start
on
for
johnny
he
was
as
heavy
as
lead
and
he
had
to
get
down
soon
as
he
got
down
the
horses
seemed
glad
and
went
off
on
a
gallop
after
the
rest
of
the
train
so
they
all
went
off
together
and
johnny
wandered
away
into
the
bogs
his
friends
supposed
of
course
he
was
coming
on
thought
he
was
walking
beside
his
load
the
snow
was
falling
down
and
perhaps
they
were
a
little
afraid
he
was
left
behind
they
scoured
the
country
for
him
next
day
and
bedad
they
found
him
stiff
dead
sitting
against
a
fence
there
where
they
found
him
they
brought
him
on
a
door
to
his
mother
oh
it
was
a
sad
thing
to
see
to
see
her
cry
and
hear
her
mourn
and
what
more
i
asked
that
all
he
was
waked
and
buried
and
that
what
he
got
for
playing
cards
and
that
all
as
true
as
ever
could
be
true
for
it
myself
knew
the
old
mother
and
she
told
me
it
her
very
self
and
she
cried
many
tears
for
her
son
chapter

daily

but
the
sheep
shearing
came
and
the
hay
season
next
and
then
the
harvest
of
small
corn
then
the
sweating
of
the
apples
and
the
turning
of
the
cider
mill
and
the
stacking
of
the
firewood
and
netting
of
the
and
the
springes
to
be
mended
in
the
garden
and
by
the
hedgerows
where
the
blackbirds
hop
to
the
molehills
in
the
white
october
mornings
and
gray
birds
come
to
look
for
snails
at
the
time
when
the
sun
is
rising
it
is
wonderful
how
time
runs
away
when
all
these
things
and
a
great
many
others
come
in
to
load
him
down
the
hill
and
prevent
him
from
stopping
to
look
about
and
i
for
my
part
can
never
conceive
how
people
who
live
in
towns
and
cities
where
neither
lambs
nor
birds
are
except
in
some
shop
windows
nor
growing
corn
nor
meadow
grass
nor
even
so
much
as
a
stick
to
cut
or
a
stile
to
climb
and
sit
down
upon
how
these
poor
folk
get
through
their
lives
without
being
utterly
weary
of
them
and
dying
from
pure
indolence
is
a
thing
god
only
knows
if
his

allows
him

nobody
seems
to
be
at

if
by
chance
you
do
find
after
long
bruising
of
knuckles
that
you
have
roused
an
inmate
it
is
some
withered
old
dame
who
is
indifferent
and
hopelessly
deaf
or
a
stupid
urchin
who
stares
as
if
you
had
dropped
from

a
cool

is
the
sole
response
to
all
inquiries
all
seems
at
a
dead
standstill
in

everything
and
everybody
is
going
at
full

transpiring
and
perspiring
to
such
a
degree
that
like
a
swiftly
whirling
top
it
does
not
appear
to
move
friends
think
of
me
as
not
living

simply
existing
and
marvel
that
i
can
endure
such
monotony
on
the
contrary
i
live
in
a
constant
state
of
excitement
hurry
and
necessity
for
immediate
action
the
cows
were
continually
getting
out
of
pasture
and
into
the
corn
the
pigs
like
the
chickens
evinced
decided
preference
for
the
garden
the
horse
would
break
his
halter
and
dart
down
the
street
or
if
in
pasture
would
leap
the
fence
at
the
risk
of
laming
his
legs
for
life
and
dash
into
a
neighbor
yard
where
children
and
babies
were
sunning
on
the
grass
rival
butchers
and
bakers
would
drive
up
simultaneously
from
different
directions
and
plead
for
patronage
and
instant
attention
the
vegetables
must
be
gathered
and
carried
to
market
every
animal
was
ravenously
hungry
at
all
hours
and
did
hesitate
to
speak
of
it
the
magnificent
peacock
would
wander
off
two
miles
choosing
the
railroad
track
for
his
rambles
and
loved
to
light
on
si
evans
barn
then
a
boy
must
be
detailed
to
recover
the
prize
bird
said
boy
depending
on
a
reward
his
consort
would
seek
the
deep
hedges
back
of
a
distant
swamp
friends
would
come
from
a
distance
to
surprise
and
cheer
me
in
my
lonely
retreat
just
at
the
time
that
the
butter
must
positively
be
made
while
the
flowers
were
choking
for
water
smothered
with
weeds
of
course
then
a
book
agent
would
appear
blind
but
doubly
persistent
with
a
illustrated
volume
recounting
minutely
the
johnstown
horror
and
one
of
my
dogs
would
be
apt
at
this
crisis
to
pursue
and
slay
a
chicken
or
poison
himself
with
every
laboring
man
for
miles
around
would
come
with
an
air
of
great
importance
to
confidentially
warn
me
against
every

these

so
villified

could
be
seen
nightly
lounging
in

of
the
grocery
discussing
politics
and
spitting
in
sweet

the
general
animosity
of
my
entire
family
to
each

caused
constant
interruptions
sandy
the
handsome
setter
loathed
the
pug
and
tried
to
bite
his
neck
in
a
fatal
way
he
also
chased
the
rabbits
trod
on
young
turkeys
so
that
they
were
no
more
drove
the
cat
out
of
the
barn
and
up
a
tree
barked
madly
at
the
cows
enraging
those
placid
animals
and
doted
on
frightening
the
horse
the
cat
allowed
mice
to
roam
merrily
through
the
grain
bins
preferring
robins
and
sparrows
especially
young
and
happy
mothers
to
a
proper
diet
was
fond
of
watching
the
chickens
with
wicked
malicious
greedy
dangerous
eyes
and
was
always
ready
to
make
a
sly
spring
for
my
canaries
the
rabbits
pretty
innocent
little
creatures
i
had
thought
them
as
i
gazed
at
their
representatives
of
white
canton
flannel
solidly
stuffed
with
such
charming
eyes
of
pink
beads
girded
all
my
young
trees
and
killed
them
before
i
dreamed
of
such
mischief
nibbled
at
every
tender
sprout
every
swelling
bud
were
so
agile
that
they
could
not
be
captured
and
became
such
a
maddening
nuisance
that
i
hired
a
boy
to
take
them
away
i
fully
understand
the
recent
excitement
of
the
australians
over
the
rabbit
scourge
which
threatened
to
devastate
their
land
the
relations
were
strained
between
my
cows
mother
and
daughter
of
a
noble
line
they
always
fed
at
opposite
corners
of
the
field
indulging
in
serious
fights
when
they
met
my
doves
i
am
almost
ready
to
say
that
they
were
more
annoying
than
all
the
rest
of
my
motley
collection
picked
all
seeds
out
of
the
ground
faster
than
they
could
be
put
in
so
large
spaces
sowed
with
rye
lay
bare
all
summer
and
ate
most
of
the
corn
and
grain
that
was
intended
to
fatten
and
stimulate
my
fowls
doves
are
poetical
and
pleasing
pigeons
ditto
in
literature
and
at
a
safe
distance
from
one
own
barn
it
a
pretty
sight
at
sunset
on
a
summer
eve
to
see
them
poising
wheeling
swirling
round
a
barn
their
rainbow
hues
gleam
brightly
in
the
sun
as
they
preen
their
feathers
or
gently
i
love
oo
on
the
ridge
pole
i
always
longed
to
own
some
but
now
the
illusion
is
past
they
have
been
admired
and
petted
for
ages
consecrated
as
emblems
of
innocence
and
peace
and
sanctity
regarded
as
almost
sacred
from
the
earliest
antiquity
they
have
been
idealized
and
praised
from
noah
to
anacreon
both
inclined
to
inebriety
but
in
reality
they
are
a
dirty
destructive
greedy
lot
and
though
fanciers
sell
them
at
high
prices
they
only
command
cents
per
pair
when
sold
for
the
market
the
hens
lost
half
their
feathers
often
an
eye
occasionally
a
life
in
deadly
feuds
my
spunky
little
bantam
game
cock
was
always
challenging
one
of
my
monster
roosters
and
laying
him
low
so
he
had
to
be
sent
away
john
my
eccentric
assistant
could
abide
no
possible
rival
insulted
every
man
engaged
to
help
him
occasionally
indulging
in
a
free
fight
after
too
frequent
visits
to
the
cider
barrels
of
my
next
neighbor
so
he
had
to
follow
the
bantam
another
distress
was
the
constant
calls
of
natives
with
the
most
undesirable
things
for
me
to
buy
two
or
three
calls
daily
for
a
long
time
boys
with
eager
ingenuous
faces
bringing
carrier
pigeons
pretty
creatures
and
i
had
been
told
there
was
money
in
pigeons
i
paid
them
extortionate
prices
on
account
of
extreme
ignorance
and
the
birds
of
course
flew
home
as
soon
as
released
to
be
bought
again
by
some
gullible
amateur
i

omitted
to
secure
the
names
and

one
day
into
the
yard
with
an
immense

in
which
was
standing
a
stupid
vicious
old
goat
and
almost
insisted
on
leaving

high

that

walked
three

a

in

pitcher
badly
cracked

then
after
making

out
a

offered
for

at
odds
with

at

her
antipathy
to
me
was
something
intense
and
personal
that
mysterious
stepmother
of
ours
was
really
riled
by
my
experiments
and
determined
to
circumvent
every
agricultural
ambition
she
detailed
a

for

nests
on

the

said
of
her
squashes
they
appeared
and
vigorous
large
and
vigorous
appeared
the
bugs
all
gleaming
in
green
and
gold
like
the
wolf
on
the
fold
and
stopped
up
all
the
stomata
and
ate
up
all
the
parenchyma
till
my
looked
as
if
they
had
grown
for
the
sole
purpose
of
illustrating
organizations
a
universal
bug
does
not
indicate
a
special
want
of
skill
in
any
one
not
liking
to
crush
the
bug
between
thumb
and
finger
as
advised
she
tried
drowning
them
she
says
the
moment
they
touched
the
water
they
all
spread
unseen
wings
and
flew
away
i
should
not
have
been
much
more
surprised
to
see
halicarnassus
soaring
over
the
ridge

i
had
not
the
slightest

they
could

one
aphis
often
the

of

in

this
seems
understated
but
i
accept
it
as
the
aphidavit
of
another
noted
helminthologist
i
might
have
imagined
nature
had
a
special
grudge
against
me

i

reach
out

there

no

but
one
sees
whole
orchards
destroyed
in
this
way
for
lack
of
time
to
attack
such
a
big
job
farmers
have
been
unjustly
attacked
by
city
critics
who
do
not
understand
the
situation
there
was
much
fine
writing
last
year
in
regard
to
the
sin
and
shame
of
cutting
down
the
pretty
wild
growth
of
shrubs
vines
and
flowers
along
the
wayside
so
picturesque
to
the
summer
tourist
the
tangle
of
wild
grape
clematis
and
woodbine
is
certainly
pretty
but
underneath
is
sure
to
be
found
a
luxuriant
growth
of
thistle
wild
carrot
silk
weed
mullein
chickweed
tansy
and
plantain
which
if
allowed
to
seed
and
disseminate
themselves
would
soon
ruin
the
best
farms
there
is
a
deadly
foe
an
army
of
foes
hiding
under
these
luxuriant
festoons
and
masses
of
cheerful
flowers
is
it
strange
and
sad
and
pitiful
that
it
is
the
summer
guest
who
alone
enjoys
the
delights
of
summering
in
the
country
there
is
no
time
for
rest
for
recreation
for
flowers
for
outdoor
pleasures
for
the
average
farmer
and
his
family
you
seldom
see
any
bright
faces
at
the
windows
which
are
seldom
opened
only
a
glimpse
here
and
there
of
a
sad
haggard
creature
peering
out
for
curosity
strange
would
it
be
to
hear
peals
of
merry
laughter
stranger
still
to
see
a
family
enjoying
a
meal
on
the
piazza
or
a
game
on
the
grass
as
for
flowers
they
are
valued
no
more
than
weeds
the
names
of
the
most
common
are
unknown
i
asked
in
vain
a
dozen
people
last
summer
what
that
flower
was
called
pointing
to
the
ubiquitous
joe
rye
weed
or
pink
motherwort
at
last
i
asked
one
man
who
affected
to
know
everything
oh
yes
i
know
it
what
is
it
i
persisted
well
i
know
it
just
as
well
but
ca
just
now
get
the
name
out
a
pause
then
with
great
superiority
i
rather
see
a
potato
field
in
full
bloom
than
all
the
flowers
in
the
world
perhaps
some
of
tolstoi
disciples
may
yet
solve
the
problem
of
new
england
abandoned
farms
he
believes
that
every
man
should
labor
with
his
own
hands
and
in
the
sweat
of
his
brow
to
produce
his
own
living
direct
from
the
soil
he
dignifies
agriculture
above
all
other
means
of
earning
a
living
and
would
have
artificial
employments
given
up
back
to
the
land
he
cries
and
back
he
really
goes
daily
working
with
the
peasants
but
is
a
solemn
almost
tragical
experience
not
much
better
than
the
fate
of
the

working
and
industrious
who
can
do
better
here
than
in
their

country
and
have
plenty
of

or
let
wealthy
men
purchase
half
a
dozen
of
these

to
make
a

two
score
for
a

ground
or
let
unattached
women
of
middle
age
occupy
them
and
support
themselves
by
raising
poultry
men
are
making
handsome
incomes
from
this
business
women
can
do
the
same
the
language
of
the
poultry
magazines
by
the
way
is
equally
sentimental
and
efflorescent
with
that
of
the
speeches
at
agricultural
fairs
sufficiently
so
to
sicken
one
who
has
once
accepted
it
as
reliable
as
for
instance
the
individual
must
be
very
abnormal
in
his
tastes
if
they
can
not
be
catered
to
by
our
feathered
tribe
to
their
owner
they
are
a
thing
of
beauty
and
a
joy
forever
their
ways
are
interesting
their
language
fascinating
and
their
lives
from
the
egg
to
the
mature
fowl
replete
with
constant
surprises
footnote
this
clause
is
true

simply
watch
them
as
they

of

the

of
every

with
pleasure
one
poultry
crank
insists
that
each
hen
must
be
so
carefully
studied
that
she
can
be
understood
and
managed
as
an
individual
and
speaks
of
his
hens
having
at
times
an
anxious
nervous
expression
yes
it
is
where
the
hens
sing
all
the
day
long
in
the
that
throws
off
the
stiff
ways
of
our
modern
civilization
and
makes
us
feel
that
we
are
home
and
can
rest
and
play
and
grow
young
once
more
how
many
men
and
women
have
regained
lost
health
and
spirits
in
keeping
hens
in
the
excitement
of
finding
and
gathering
eggs
it
is
not
the
natural
laying

the

tingles
in
sparkling

after
my
pathetic

after
a

downy

grew
ill

chapter
ix
the
passing
of
the
peacocks
i
would
rather
look
at
a
peacock
than
eat
him
the
feathers
of
an
angel
and
the
voice
of
a
devil
the
story
of
this
farm
would
not
be
complete
without
a
brief
rehearsal
of
my
experiences
exciting
varied
and
tragic
resulting
from
the
purchase
of
a
magnificent
pair
of
peacocks
my
honest
intention
on
leasing
my
paradise
was
simply
to
occupy
the
quaint
old
house
for
a
season
or
two
as
a
relief
from
the
usual
summer
wanderings
i
would
plant
nothing
but
a
few
hardy
flowers
of
the
kind
an
economical
and
prolonged
picnic
in
this
way
i
could
easily
save
in
three
years
sufficient
funds
to
make
a
grand
i
tour
du
monde
i
that
was
my
plan
for
some
weeks
i
carried
out
this
resolution
until
an
event
occurred
which
changed
the
entire
current
of
thought
and
transformed
a
quiet
rural
retreat
into
a
scene
of
frantic
activity
and
gigantic
undertaking
in
the
early
summer
i
attended
a
poultry
show
at
rooster
and
in
a
moment
of
impulsive
enthusiasm
was
so
foolish
as
to
pause
and
admire
and
long
for
a
prize
peacock
until
i
was
fairly
and
hopelessly
hypnotized
by
its
brilliant
plumage
i
reasoned
anybody
can
keep
hens
me
and
crankin
can
raise
ducks
geese
thrive
naturally
with
me
but
a
peacock
is
a
rare
and
glorious
possession
the
proud
scenes
he
is
associated
with
in
mythology
history
and
art
rushed
through
my
mind
with
whirlwind
rapidity
as
i
stood
debating
the
question
the
favorite
bird
of
juno
she
called
the
metallic
spots
on
its
tail
the
eyes
of
argus
imported
by
solomon
to
palestine
essentially
regal
kings
have
used
peacocks
as
their
crests
have
worn
crowns
of
their
feathers
queens
and
princesses
have
flirted
gorgeous
peacock
fans
the
pavan
a
favorite
dance
in
the
days
of
louis
le
grand
imitated
its
stately
step
in
the
days
of
chivalry
the
most
solemn
oath
was
taken
on
the
peacock
body
roasted
whole
and
adorned
with
its
gay
feathers
as
shallow
swore
by
cock
and
pie
i
saw
the
fairest
of
all
the
fair
dames
at
a
grand
mediaeval
banquet
proudly
bearing
the
bird
to
the
table
the
woman
who
hesitates
is
lost
i
bought
the
pair
and
ordered
them
boxed
for
breezy
meadows
on
the
arrival
of
the
royal
pair
at
my
home
all
its
surroundings
began
to
lose
the
charm
of
rustic
simplicity
and
appear
shabby
inappropriate
and
unendurable
it
became
evident
that
the
entire
place
must
be
raised
and
at
once
to
the
level
of
those
peacocks
the
house
and
barn
were
painted
colonial
yellow
without
a
delay
an
ornamental
piazza
was
added
all
the
paths
were
broadened
and
graveled
and
even
terraces
were
dreamed
of
as
i
recalled
the
terraces
where
lord
beaconsfield
peacocks
used
to
sun
themselves
and
display
their
beauties
queen
victoria
now
has
a
screen
made
of
their
feathers
my
expensive
pets
felt
their
degradation
in
spite
of
my
best
efforts
and
determined
to
sever
their
connection
with
such
a
plebeian
place
beauty
i
ought
to
have
called
him
absalom
or
alcibiades
as
soon
as
let
out
of
his
traveling
box
displayed
to
an
admiring
crowd
a
tail
so
long
it
might
be
called
a
serial
gave
one
contemptuous
glance
at
the
premises
and
departed
so
rapidly
by
running
and
occasional
flights
that
three
men
and
a
boy
were
unable
to
catch
up
with
him
for
several
hours
belle
was
not
allowed
her
liberty
as
we
saw
more
trouble
ahead
a
large
yard
inclosed
top
and
sides
with
wire
netting
at
last
restrained
their
roving
ambition
but
they
were
not
happy
peacocks
disdain
a
roost
and
seek
the
top
of
some
tall
tree
they
are
also
rovers
by
nature
and
hate
confinement
they
pined
and
failed
and
seemed
slowly
dying
so
i
had
to
let
them
out
total
cost
of
peacock
hunts
by
the
boys
of
the
village
i
found
that
beauty
was
happy
only
when
admiring
himself
or
deep
in
mischief
his
chief
delight
was
to
mount
the
stone
wall
and
utter
his
raucous
note
again
and
again
as
a
carriage
passed
often
scaring
the
horses
into
dangerous
antics
and
causing
severe
if
not
profane
criticism
or
he
would
steal
slyly
into
a
neighbor
barn
and
kill
half
a
dozen
chickens
at
a
time
he
was
awake
every
morning
by
four
and
would
announce
the
glories
of
the
coming
dawn
by
a
series
of
notes
disturbing
not
only
all
my
guests
but
the
various
families
within
range
until
complaints
and
petitions
were
sent
in
he
became
a
nuisance
but
how
could
he
be
muzzled
and
he
was
so
gloriously
handsome
visitors
from
town
would
come
expressly
to
see
him
school
children
would
troop
into
my
yard
on
saturday
afternoons
to
see
the
peacock
spread
his
tail
which
he
often
capriciously
refused
to
do
as
soon
as
they
departed
somewhat
disappointed
in
my
great
moral
show
beauty
would
go
to
a
large
window
on
the
ground
floor
of
the
barn
and
parade
up
and
down
displaying
his
beauties
for
his
own
gratification
at
last
he
fancied
he
saw
a
rival
in
this
brilliant
irridescent
reflection
and
pecked
fiercely
at
the
glass
breaking
several
panes
utterly
selfish
he
would
keep
all
dainty
bits
for
himself
leaving
the
scraps
for
his
devoted
mate
who
would
wait
meekly
to
eat
what
he
chose
to
leave
she
made
up
for
this
wifely
by
frequenting
the
hen
houses
she
would
watch
patiently
by
the
side
of
a
hen
on
her
nest
and
as
soon
as
an
egg
was
deposited
would
remove
it
for
her
luncheon
she
liked
raw
eggs
and
six
were
her
usual
limit
there
is
a
deal
of
something
closely
akin
to
human
nature
in
fowls
it
was
irresistibly
ludicrous
to
see
the
peacock
strutting
about
in
the
sunshine
his
tail
expanded
in
fullest
glory
making
a
curious
rattle
of
triumph
as
he
paraded
while
my
large
white
holland
turkey
gobbler
who
had
been
molting
severely
and
was
almost
denuded
as
to
tail
feathers
would
attempt
to
emulate
his
display
and
would
follow
him
closely
his
wattles
swelling
and
reddening
with
fancied
success
making
all
this
fuss
about
what
had
been
a
fine
array
but
now
was
reduced
to
five
scrubby
ragged
very
dirty
remnants
of
feathers
he
fancied
himself
equally
fine
and
was
therefore
equally
happy
next
came
the
molting
period
pliny
said
long
ago
of
the
peacock
when
he
hath
lost
his
taile
he
hath
no
delight
to
come
abroad
but
i
knew
nothing
of
this
peculiarity
supposing
that
a
peacock
tail
once
grown
was
a
permanent
ornament
on
the
contrary
if
a
peacock
should
live
one
hundred
and
twenty
years
and
his
longevity
is
something
phenomenal
he
would
have
one
hundred
and
seventeen
new
and
interesting
tails
enough
to
start
a
circulating
library
yes
beauty
pride
and
mine
had
a
sad
fall
as
one
by
one
the
long
plumes
were
dropped
in
road
and
field
and
garden
he
should
have
been
caught
and
confined
and
the
feathers
all
loose
at
once
should
have
been
pulled
out
at
one
big
pull
and
saved
intact
for
fans
and
dust
brushes
and
adornment
of
mirrors
and
soon
every
one
was
gone
and
the
mortified
creature
now
hid
away
in
the
corn
and
behind
shrubbery
disappearing
entirely
from
view
save
as
hunger
necessitated
a
brief
emerging
this
tailless
absentee
was
not
what
i
had
bought
as
the
champion
prize
winner
and
belle
after
laying
four
eggs
refused
to
set
but
i
put
them
under
a
turkey
and
to
console
myself
and
my
position
as
an
owner
of
peacocks
i
began
to
study
peacock
lore
and
literature
i
read
once
more
of
the
throne
of
the
greatest
of
all
the
moguls
at
delhi
india
the
under
part
of
the
canopy
is
embroidered
with
pearls
and
diamonds
with
a
fringe
of
pearls
round
about
on
the
top
of
the
canopy
which
is
made
like
an
arch
with
four
panes
stands
a
peacock
with
his
tail
spread
consisting
all
of
sapphires
and
other
stones
the
body
is
of
beaten
gold
enchased
with
several
jewels
and
a
great
ruby
upon
his
breast
at
which
hangs
a
pearl
that
weighs
fifty
carats
on
each
side
of
the
peacock
stand
two
nosegays
as
high
as
the
bird
consisting
of
several
sorts
of
flowers
all
of
beaten
gold
enameled
when
the
king
seats
himself
upon
the
throne
there
is
a
transparent
jewel
with
a
diamond
appendant
of
eighty
or
ninety
carats
encompassed
with
rubies
and
emeralds
so
hung
that
it
is
always
in
his
eye
the
twelve
pillars
also
that
support
the
canopy
are
set
with
rows
of
fair
pearls
round
and
of
an
excellent
water
that
weigh
from
six
to
ten
carats
apiece
at
the
distance
of
four
feet
upon
each
side
of
the
throne
are
placed
two
parasols
or
umbrellas
the
handles
whereof
are
about
eight
feet
high
covered
with
diamonds
the
parasols
themselves
are
of
crimson
velvet
embroidered
and
stringed
with
pearls
this
is
the
famous
throne
which
tamerlane
began
and
shah
jahan
finished
which
is
really
reported
to
have
cost
a
hundred
and
sixty
million
five
hundred
thousand
livres
million
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
i
also
gloated
over
the
description
of
that
famous
london
known
to
the
art
world
as
the
peacock
room
designed
by
whistler
panels
to
the
right
and
left
represent
peacocks
with
their
tails
spread
advancing
in
perspective
toward
the
spectator
one
behind
the
other
the
peacocks
in
gold
and
the
ground
in
blue
i
could
not
go
so
extensively
into
interior
decoration
and
my
mania
for
making
the
outside
of
the
house
and
the
grounds
highly
decorative
had
received
a
severe
lesson
in
the
verdict
overheard
by
me
as
i
stood
in
the
garden
made
by
a
gawky
country
couple
who
were
out
for
a
sunday
drive
as
warner
once
said
to
me
young
love
in
the
country
is
a
very
solemn
thing
and
this
shy
serious
pair
slowed
up
as
they
passed
to
see
my
place
the
piazza
was
gay
with
hanging
baskets
vines
strings
of
beads
and
bells
lanterns
of
all
hues
there
were
tables
little
and
big
and
lounging
chairs
and
a
hammock
and
two
canaries
the
brightest
geraniums
blossomed
in
small
beds
through
the
grass
and
several
long
flower
beds
were
one
brilliant
mass
of
bloom
while
giant
reared
their
golden
heads
the
entire
length
of
the
farm
it
was
gay
but
i
had
hoped
to
please
beauty
what
is
that
said
the
girl
straining
her
head
out
of
the
carriage
do
know
said
the
youth
guess
it
a
store
the
girl
scrutinized
the
scene
as
a
whole
and
said
decisively
no
bill
it
a
saloon
that
was
a
cruel
blow
i
forgot
my
flowers
walked
in
slowly
and
sadly
and
carried
in
two
lanterns
to
store
in
the
shed
chamber
i
also
resolved
to
have
no
more
flower
beds
in
front
of
the
house
star
shaped
or
diamond
they
must
all
be
sodded
over
that
opinion
of
my
earnest
efforts
to
effect
a
renaissance
at
gooseville
to
show
how
a
happy
farm
home
should
look
to
the
in
short
my
struggle
to
live
up
to
the
peacocks
revealed
as
does
a
lightning
flash
on
a
dark
night
much
that
i
had
not
perceived
i
had
made
as
great
a
mistake
as
the
farmer
who
abjures
flowers
and
despises
fixin
up
the
pendulum
of
emotion
swung
as
far
back
and
i
almost
disliked
the
innocent
cause
of
my
decorative
folly
i
began
to
look
over
my
accounts
to
study
my
check
books
to
do
some
big
sums
in
addition
and
it
made
me
even
more
depressed
result
of
these
mental
exercises
as
follows
rent
per
year
incidental
expenses
to
date
was
there
any
good
in
this
silly
investment
of
mine
well
if
it
came
to
the
very
worst
i
could
kill
the
couple
and
have
a
rare
dish
yet
horace
did
not
think
its
flesh
equal
to
an
ordinary
chicken
he
wrote
i
shall
prevail
to
make
our
men
of
taste
a
pullet
choose
and
the
gay
peacock
with
its
train
refuse
for
the
rare
bird
at
mighty
price
is
sold
and
lo
what
wonders
from
its
tail
unfold
but
can
these
whims
a
higher
gusto
raise
unless
you
eat
the
plumage
that
you
praise
or
do
its
glories
when
is
boiled
remain
no
is
the
unequaled
beauty
of
its
train
deludes
your
eye
and
charms
you
to
the
feast
for
hens
and
peacocks
are
alike
in
taste
then
peacocks
have
been
made
useful
in
a
medicinal
way
the
doctors
once
prescribed
peacock
broth
for
pleurisy
peacocks
tongues
for
epilepsy
peacocks
fat
for
colic
peacocks
galls
for
weak
eyes
peahens
eggs
for
gout
it
is
always
darkest
just
before
dawn
and
only
a
week
from
that
humiliating
sunday
episode
i
was
called
by
my
gardener
to
look
at
the
dearest
little
brown
something
that
was
darting
about
in
the
poultry
yard
it
was
a
baby
peacock
only
one
day
old
he
got
out
of
the
nest
in
some
way
and
preferred
to
take
care
of
himself
how
independent
how
captivating
he
was
as
not
one
other
egg
had
hatched
he
was
lamentably
desperately
alone
with
dangers
on
every
side
homeless
and
orphanless
something
on
that
sabbath
morning
recalled
melchizedec
the
priest
without
father
or
mother
of
royal
descent
and
of
great
length
of
days
earnestly
hoping
for
longevity
for
this
feathered
mite
of
princely
birth
i
called
him
melchizedec
i
caught
him
and
was
in
his
toils
he
was
a
tiny
tyrant
i
was
but
a
slave
an
attendant
a
nurse
a
completely
under
his
claw
no
more
work
no
more
leisure
no
more
music
or
tennis
my
life
career
my
sphere
was
definitely
settled
i
was
kizzie
attendant
nothing
more
people
have
cared
for
rather
odd
pets
as
the
leeches
tamed
and
trained
by
lord
erskine
others
have
been
deeply
interested
in
toads
crickets
mice
lizards
alligators
tortoises
and
monkeys

terms

sir

to

the
affections
of

syrian

charles
dudley
warner
devoted
an
entire
article
in
the
atlantic
monthly
to
the
praises
of
his
cat
calvin
but
did
you
ever
hear
of
a
peacock
as
a
household
pet
as
it
is
the
correct
thing
now
to
lie
down
all
of
a
summer
afternoon
hidden
by
trees
and
closely
watch
every
movement
of
a
pair
of
little
birds
or
spend
hours
by
a
frog
pond
studying
the
sluggish
life
there
and
as
mothers
are
urged
by
scientific
students
to
record
daily
the
development
of
their
infants
in
each
apparently
unimportant
matter
i
think
i
may
be
excused
for
a
brief
sketch
of
my
charge
for
no
mother
ever
had
a
child
so
precocious
so
wise
so
willful
so
affectionate
so
persistent
as
kizzie
i
at
the
same
age
before
he
was
three
days
old
he
would
follow
me
like
a
dog
up
and
down
stairs
and
all
over
the
house
walk
behind
me
as
i
strolled
about
the
grounds
and
when
tired
he
would
cry
and
peep
weep
for
me
to
sit
down
then
he
would
beg
to
be
taken
on
my
lap
thence
he
would
proceed
to
my
arm
then
my
neck
where
he
would
peck
and
scream
and
flutter
determined
to
nestle
there
for
a
nap
my
solicitude
increased
as
he
lived
on
and
i
hoped
to
raise
him
he
literally
demanded
every
moment
of
my
time
my
entire
attention
during
the
day
and
alas
at
night
also
until
i
seemed
to
be
living
a
tragic
farce
if
put
down
on
carpet
or
matting
he
at
once
began
to
pick
up
everything
he
could
spy
on
the
floor
and
never
before
did
i
realize
how
much
could
be
found
there
i
had
a
dressmaker
in
the
house
and
kizzie
was
always
going
for
a
deadly
danger
here
a
pin
there
a
needle
just
a
step
away
a
tack
or
a
bit
of
thread
or
a
bead
of
jet
outdoors
it
was
even
worse
with
two
bird
dogs
ready
for
anything
but
birds
the
pug
that
had
already
devoured
all
that
had
come
to
me
of
my
expensive
importations
a
neighbor
cat
often
stealing
over
to
hunt
for
her
dinner
a
crisis
seemed
imminent
every
minute
even
his
own
father
would
destroy
him
if
they
met
as
the
peacock
allows
no
possible
rival
and
kizzie
kept
so
close
to
my
heels
that
i
hardly
dared
step
if
my
days
were
distracting
the
nights
were
inexpressibly
awful
i
supposed
he
would
be
glad
to
go
to
sleep
in
a
natural
way
after
a
busy
day
no
indeed
he
would
not
stay
in
box
or
basket
or
anywhere
but
cradled
close
in
my
neck
there
he
wished
to
remain
twittering
happily
giving
now
and
then
a
sweet
little
tremulous
trill
indicative
of
content
warmth
and
drowsiness
if
i
dared
to
move
ever
so
little
showing
by
a
sharp
scratch
from
his
claws
that
he
preferred
absolute
quiet
one
night
when
all
worn
out
i
rose
and
put
him
in
a
hat
box
and
covered
it
closely
but
his
piercing
cries
of
distress
and
anger
prevented
the
briefest
nap
reminding
me
of
the
old
man
who
said
yes
it
pretty
dangerous
livin
anywheres
i
was
so
afraid
of
hurting
him
that
i
scarcely
dared
move
each
night
we
had
a
prolonged
battle
but
he
never
gave
in
for
one
instant
until
he
could
roost
on
my
outstretched
finger
or
just
under
my
chin
then
he
would
settle
down
the
conflict
over
he
as
usual
the
victor
and
the
sweet
little
lullaby
would
begin
one
night
i
rose
hastily
to
close
the
windows
in
a
sudden
shower
kizzie
wakened
promptly
and
actually
followed
me
out
of
the
room
and
alas
it
was
not
far
from
his
breakfast
hour
for
he
preferred
his
first
meal
at
four
you
see
how
he
influenced
me
to
rise
early
and
take
plenty
of
exercise
i
once
heard
of
a
wealthy
frenchman
nervous
and
dyspeptic
who
was
ordered
by
his
eccentric
physician
to
buy
a
barbary
ostrich
and
imitate
him
as
well
as
care
for
him
and
he
was
quickly
cured
on
the
other
hand
it
is
said
that
animals
and
birds
grow
to
be
like
those
who
train
and
pet
them
christopher
north
john
wilson
used
to
carry
a
sparrow
in
his
coat
pocket
and
his
friends
averred
that
the
bird
grew
so
large
and
impressive
that
it
seemed
to
be
changing
into
an
i
eagle
but
kizzie
was
the
stronger
influence
i
really
grew
afraid
of
him
as
he
liked
to
watch
my
eyes
and
once
picked
at
them
as
he
always
picked
at
any
shining
bit
what
respect
i
now
feel
for
a
sober
successful
old
hen
who
raises
brood
after
brood
of
downy
darlings
without
mishaps
her
instinct
is
an
inspiration
kizzie
liked
to
perch
on
my
finger
and
catch
flies
for
his
dinner
how
solemn
wise
and
bewitching
he
did
look
as
he
snapped
at
and
swallowed
fifteen
flies
uttering
all
the
time
a
satisfied
little
note
quite
distinct
from
his
musical
slumber
song
how
he
enjoyed
lying
on
one
side
stretched
out
at
full
length
to
bask
in
the
sun
a
miniature
copy
of
his
magnificent
father
very
careful
was
he
of
his
personal
appearance
pruning
and
preening
his
pretty
feathers
many
times
each
day
paying
special
attention
to
his
tail
not
more
than
an
inch
long
but
what
a
prophecy
of
the
future
as
mothers
care
most
for
the
most
troublesome
child
so
i
grew
daily
more
fond
of
cute
little
kizzie
more
anxious
that
he
should
live
i
could
talk
all
day
of
his
funny
ways
of
his
fondness
for
me
of
his
daily
increasing
intelligence
of
his
escapes
etc
the
old
story
the
dear
gazelle
experience
came
all
too
soon
completely
worn
out
with
my
constant
vigils
i
intrusted
him
for
one
night
to
a
friend
who
assured
me
that
she
was
a
most
quiet
sleeper
and
that
he
could
rest
safely
on
her
fingers
i
was
too
tired
to
say
no
she
came
to
me
at
daybreak
with
poor
kizzie
dead
in
her
hands
he
died
like
desdemona
smothered
with
pillows
all
i
can
do
in
his
honor
has
been
done
by
this
inadequate
recital
of
his
charms
and
his
capacity
after
a
few
days
of
sincere
grief
i
reflected
philosophically
that
if
he
had
not
passed
away
i
must
have
gone
soon
and
naturally
felt
it
preferable
that
i
should
be
the
survivor
a
skillful
taxidermist
has
preserved
as
much
of
kizzie
as
possible
for
me
and
he
now
adorns
the
parlor
mantel
a
weak
mute
reminder
of
three
weeks
of
anxiety
and
his
parents
the
peahen
died
suddenly
and
mysteriously
there
was
no
apparent
reason
for
her
demise
but
the
autopsy
which
revealed
a
large
and
irregular
fragment
of
window
glass
lodged
in
her
gizzard
proved
that
she
was
a
victim
of
beauty
vanity
a
friend
who
was
present
said
as
he
tenderly
held
the
glass
between
thumb
and
finger
it
is
now
easy
to
see
through
the
cause
of
her
death
under
the
circumstances
it
would
be
idle
to
speak
of
it
as
beauty
had
never
seemed
very
devoted
to
her
but
he
mourned
her
long
and
sincerely
now
that
she
had
gone
he
appreciated
her
meek
adoration
her
altruistic
devotion
another
touch
like
human
nature
and
when
after
a
decent
period
of
mourning
another
spouse
was
secured
for
him
he
refused
to
notice
her
and
wandered
solitary
and
sad
to
a
neighbor
fields
the
new
madam
was
not
allowed
to
share
the
high
roost
on
the
elm
she
was
obliged
to
seek
a
less
elevated
and
airy
dormitory
his
voice
always
distressingly
harsh
was
now
so
awful
that
it
was
fascinating
the
notes
seemed
cracked
by
grief
or
illness
at
last
growing
feebler
he
succumbed
to
some
wasting
malady
and
no
longer
strutted
about
in
brilliant
or
came
to
the
piazza
calling
imperiously
for
dainties
but
rested
for
hours
in
some
quiet
corner
the
physician
who
was
called
in
prescribed
for
his
liver
he
showed
symptoms
of
poisoning
and
i
began
to
fear
that
in
his
visit
to
a
neighbor
potato
fields
he
had
indulged
in
paris
green
possibly
with
suicidal
intent
there
was
something
heroic
in
his
way
of
dying
no
moans
no
cries
just
a
dignified
endurance
from
the
western
window
of
the
shed
chamber
where
he
lay
he
could
see
the
multitude
of
fowls
below
in
the
yards
where
he
had
so
lately
reigned
supreme
occasionally
with
a
heroic
effort
he
would
get
on
his
legs
and
gaze
wistfully
on
the
lively
crowd
so
unmindful
of
his
wretchedness
then
sink
back
exhausted
reminding
me
of
some
grand
old
monarch
statesman
or
warrior
looking
for
the
last
time
on
the
scenes
of
his
former
triumphs
i
should
have
named
him
socrates
at
last
he
was
carried
to
a
cool
resting
place
in
the
deep
grass
covered
with
pink
mosquito
netting
and
one
kind
friend
after
another
fanned
him
and
watched
over
his
last
moments
after
he
was
really
dead
and
tom
with
tears
rolling
down
his
face
carried
him
tenderly
away
i
woke
from
my
ambitious
dream
and
felt
verily
guilty
of
aviscide
but
for
my
vainglorious
ambition
beauty
would
doubtless
be
alive
and
resplendent
his
consort
modest
hued
and
devoted
at
his
side
and
my
bank
account
would
have
a
better
showing
there
is
a
motto
as
follows
let
him
keep
peacock
to
himself
derived
in
this
way
when
george
iii
had
partly
recovered
from
one
of
his
attacks
his
ministers
got
him
to
read
the
king
speech
but
he
ended
every
sentence
with
the
word
peacock
the
minister
who
drilled
him
said
that
peacock
was
an
excellent
word
for
ending
a
sentence
only
kings
should
not
let
subjects
hear
it
but
should
whisper
it
softly
the
result
was
a
perfect
success
the
pause
at
the
close
of
each
sentence
had
such
a
fine
elocutionary
effect
in
future
when
longing
to
indulge
in
some
new
display
yield
to
another
temptation
let
me
whisper
peacock
and
be
saved

looking
back
then
you
seriously
suppose
doctor
that

is

i
do
for

sow

is
decided
for
you
and
the
public
opinion
is
soon
reported
as
something
you
should
know
as
a
witty
spinster
once
remarked
it
no
use
to
fib
about
your
age
in
your
native
village
some
old
woman
always
had
a
calf
born
the
same
night
you
were

you
find
out
whether
ye
want
to
quit
foolin
with

or
not
now
my
hens
doa
git
no

nor
no
such
nonsense
and
i
ai
got
no
bone

nor

i
let
scratch
for

and
have
their
liberty
and
mine
look
full
i
give
ye
one
you
could
save
a
lot
by
engagin
an
old
hoss
that
got
to
be
killed
i
allers
looking
round
in
the
fall
of
the
year
for
some
old
critter
just
ready
to
drop
wait
till
cold
weather
and
then
when
he
killed
hang
half
of
him
up
in
the
hen
house
and
see
how
they
pick
at
it
it
the
best
feed
going
for
hens
and
makes

along

cost
either
i
had
been
asked
to
give
a
lecture
in
a
neighboring
town
and
to
change
the
subject
inquired
if
he
thought
many
would
attend
jake
looked
rather
blank
took
off
his
cap
scratched
his
head
and
then
said
i
dunno
ef
you
was
a
beecher
or
a
gough
you
could
fill
the
hall
or
may
be
ef
your
more
known
like
and
would
talk
to
free
you
might
git
or
if
you
going
to
sing
or
dress
up
to
make
larf
but
i
as
i
dunno
after
the
effort
was
over
i
tried
to
sound
him
as
to
my
success
he
was
unusually
reticent
and
would
only
say
wall
the
only
man
i
heard
speak
o
said
was
different
from
anything
he
ever
heard
this
reminded
me
of
a
capital
story
told
me
by
an
old
family
doctor
many
years
ago
it
was
that
sort
of
anecdote
now
out
of
fashion
with
i
raconteurs
a
long
preamble
many
details
a
gradual
increase
of
interest
and
a
vivid
climax
and
when
told
by
a
sick
bed
would
sometimes
weary
the
patient
a
man
not
especially
well
known
had
given
a
lecture
in
a
new
hampshire
town
without
rousing
much
enthusiasm
in
his
audience
and
as
he
rode
away
on
the
top
of
the
stage
coach
next
morning
he
tried
to
get
some
sort
of
opinion
from
jim
barker
the
driver
after
pumping
in
vain
for
a
compliment
the
gentleman
inquired
did
you
hear
nothing
about
my
lecture
from
any
of
the
people
i
should
like
very
much
to
get
some
idea
of
how
it
was
received
wall
no
stranger
i
ca
say
as
i
heerd
much
i
guess
the
folks
was
purty
well
pleased
no
one
seemed
to
be
it
but
square
lothrop
and
may
i
ask
what
he
said
wall
i
would
mind
it
if
you
what
he
said
he
says
just
what
he
thinks
right
out
with
it
no
matter
who
hurt
and
he
usually
gets
the
gist
o
but
i
would
mind
what
he
said
the
public
was
purty
generally
pleased
and
the
long
whip
lash
cracks
and
jim
shouts
get
an
dandy
yes
persisted
the
tortured
man
but
i
do
want
very
much
to
know
what
squire
lothrop
opinion
was
now
stranger
i
would
think
any
more
about
the
square
he
got
good
common
sense
and
allers
hits
the
nail
on
the
head
but
as
i
said
you
pleased
fust
rate
yes
but
i
must
know
what
squire
lothrop
did
say
wall
if
you
will
have
it
he
did
say
and
he
apt
to
get
the
gist
o
he
did
say
that
i
he
thought
was
i
awful
shaller
many
epigrammatic
sayings
come
back
to
me
and
one
is
too
good
to
be
omitted
an
old
woman
was
fiercely
criticising
a
neighbor
and
ended
in
this
way
folks
that
pretend
to
be
somebody
and
do
act
like
nobody
ai
anybody
another
woman
reminded
me
of
partington
she
told
tales
of
the
positive
reappearance
of
departed
spirits
and
when
i
said
do
you
really
believe
all
this
she
replied
indeed
i
do
and
yet
i
not
an
i
imaginary
woman
her
dog
was
provoked
into
a
conflict
with
my
setters
and
she
exclaimed
why
i
never
saw
him
so
completely
i
ennervated
then
the
dear
old
lady
who
said
she
was
a
free
thinker
and
ashamed
of
it
guessed
she
knew
as
much
as
the
minister
this
world
or
the
next
liked
nothing
better
than
to
set
down
sunday
afternoons
after
she
fed
her
hens
and
read
ingersoll
what
books
of
his
have
you
i
asked
she
handed
me
a
small
volume
which
did
not
look
like
any
of
bob
productions
it
was
a
guide
book
through
picturesque
vermont
by
ernest
ingersoll
and
i
must
not
omit
the
queer
sayings
of
a
hired
man
on
a
friend
farm
oh
for
a
photo
of
him
as
i
saw
him
one
cold
rainy
morning
tending
jason
kibby
dozen
cows
he
had
on
a
rubber
coat
and
cap
but
his
trouser
legs
were
rolled
above
the
knee
and
he
was
barefoot
hannibal
i
shouted
you
take
cold
with
your
feet
in
that
wet
grass
gueth
not
marm
he
lisped
back
cheerily
i
never
cared
for
shooth
mythelf
he
was
always
shouting
across
the
way
to
inquire
if
i
thith
wath
hot
enough
or
cold
enough
to
thute
i
me
as
if
i
had
expressed
a
strong
desire
for
phenomenal
extremes
of
temperature
one
morning
he
suddenly
departed
i
met
him
trudging
along
with
three
hats
jammed
on
to
his
head
and
a
rubber
coat
under
his
arm
for
was
a
fine
day
why
hanny
i
exclaimed
where
are
you
going
in
such
haste
mithter
kibby
told
me
to
go
to
halifax
and
i
going
next
the
man
who
was
anxious
to
go
into
partnership
with
me
he
would
work
my
farm
at
halves
or
i
could
buy
his
farm
cranberry
bog
and
woodland
and
he
would
live
right
on
there
and
run
that
place
at
halves
urged
me
to
buy
twelve
or
fourteen
cows
cheap
in
the
fall
and
start
a
milk
route
he
to
be
the
active
partner
then
he
had
a
chance
to
buy
a
lot
of
essences
cheap
and
if
i
purchase
a
he
put
in
his
old
horse
and
we
go
halves
on
that
business
or
i
could
buy
up
a
lot
of
calves
or
young
pigs
and
he
feed
and
we
go
halves
but
i
will
not
take
you
through
my
entire
as
i
have
two
good
stories
to
tell
you
before
saying
depressing
remarks
have
reached
me
about
my
lakelet
which
at
first
was
ridiculed
by
every
one
the
struggle
of
evolution
from
the
spring
hole
was
severe
and
protracted
experts
were
summoned
their
estimates
of
cost
ranging
from
four
hundred
to
one
thousand
dollars
and
no
one
thought
it
worth
while
to
touch
it
it
was
discouraging
venerable
and
enormous
turtles
hid
in
its
muddy
depths
and
snapped
at
the
legs
of
the
ducks
as
they
dived
adding
a
limp
to
the
waddle
frogs
croaked
there
dismally
mosquitoes
made
it
a
camping
ground
and
head
center
big
black
water
snakes
often
came
to
drink
and
lingered
by
the
edge
the
ugly
horn
pout
was
the
only
fish
that
could
live
there
depressing
in
contrast
with
my
rosy
dreams
but
now
the
little
lake
is
a
charming
reality
and
the
boat
is
built
and
launched
turtles
pout
lily
roots
as
big
as
small
trees
and
two
hundred
loads
of
alluvial
deposit
are
no
longer
in
it
while
carp
are
promised
me
by
my
friend
commissioner
blackford
the
tomtoolan
is
not
a
large
body
of
water
one
hundred
and
fifty
feet
long
feet
wide
but
it
is
a
delight
to
me
and
has
been
grossly
traduced
by
ignorant
or
envious
outsiders
the
day
after
the
was
christened
a
boat
painted
prettily
with
blue
and
gold
i
invited
a
lady
to
try
it
with
me
flags
were
fluttering
from
stem
and
stern
we
took
a
gayly
colored
horn
to
toot
as
we
went
and
two
dippers
to
bail
if
necessary
it
was
not
exactly
youth
at
the
prow
and
pleasure
at
the
helm
but
we
were
very
jolly
and
not
a
little
proud
footnote
named
in
honor
of
the
amateur
engineers
a
neglected
soon
caused
the
boat
to
leak
badly
we
had
made
but
one
circuit
when
we
were
obliged
to
hug
the
shore
and
devote
our
entire
energies
to
bailing
tip
her
a
little
more
i
cried
and
the
next
instant
we
were
both
rolled
into
the
water
it
was
an
absurd
experience
and
after
scrambling
out
our
clothes
so
heavy
we
could
scarcely
step
we
vowed
between
hysteric
fits
of
laughter
to
keep
our
a
profound
secret
but
the
next
time
i
went
to
town
friends
began
to
smile
mysteriously
asked
me
if
i
had
been
out
on
the
lake
yet
made
sly
and
jocose
allusions
to
a
sudden
change
to
baptistic
faith
and
if
i
cordially
invited
them
to
join
me
in
a
row
would
declare
a
preference
for
surf
and
salt
water
or
if
pressed
would
murmur
in
the
meanest
way
something
about
having
a
at
home
it
is
now
nearly
a
year
since
that
little
adventure
but
it
is
still
a
subject
of
mirth
even
in
other
towns
a
friend
calling
yesterday
told
me
the
version
he
had
just
heard
at
gillford
ten
miles
away
you
bet
they
have
comical
at
that
woman
farm
by
the
gooseville
depot
she
got
a
regular
menagerie
fust
off
everything
she
see
or
could
hear
of
got
sick
o
the
circus
bizness
and
went
into
potatoes
deep
they
say
she
was
actually
up
and
outdoors
by
working
and
worrying
over
the
tater
bugs
she
a
fleshy
woman
and
some
of
our
folks
going
by
in
the
cars
would
tell
of
seeing
her
tramping
up
and
down
the
long
furrows
with
half
a
dozen
boys
hired
to
help
her
soon
as
she
killed
most
of
her
own
a
million
more
just
traveled
over
from
the
field
opposite
where
they
had
had
their
own
way
and
cleaned
out
most
everything
then
what
the
bugs
spared
the
long
rains
rotted
so
i
hear
she
giv
up
potatoes
then
she
got
sot
on
scooping
out
a
seven
by
nine
mud
hole
to
make
a
pond
and
had
a
boat
built
to
match
well
by
darn
she
took
a
stout
woman
in
with
her
and
as
i
heerd
it
that
boat
just
giv
one
groan
and
sunk
right
down
as
to
the
potatoes
i
might
never
have
escaped
from
that
terrific
thralldom
if
a
city
friend
after
hearing
my
woful
experience
had
not
inquired
quietly
why
have
potatoes
it
much
cheaper
to
buy
all
you
need
i
had
been
laboring
under
a
strange
spell
supposed
i
i
must
plant
potatoes
the
relief
is
unspeakable
jennie
june
once
said
the
great
art
of
life
is
to
i
eliminate
i
admired
the
condensed
wisdom
of
this
but
like
experience
it
only
serves
to
illume
the
path
over
which
i
have
passed
one
little
incident
occurred
this
spring
which
is
too
funny
to
withhold
among
the
groceries
ordered
from
boston
was
a
piece
of
extra
fine
cheese
a
connoisseur
in
cheese
had
advised
me
to
try
it
it
recommended
itself
so
strongly
that
i
placed
it
carefully
under
glass
in
a
place
all
by
itself
it
i
was
strong
strong
enough
to
sew
buttons
on
strong
as
sampson
strong
enough
to
walk
away
alone
one
warm
morning
it
seemed
to
have
gained
during
the
night
its
penetrating
permeating
power
was
something
almost
supernatural
i
carried
it
from
one
place
to
another
each
time
more
remote
it
would
not
be
lonely
if
segregrated
doubtless
it
had
ample
social
facilities
within
itself
at
last
i
became
desperate
ellen
i
exclaimed
just
bring
in
that
cheese
and
burn
it
it
comes
high
too
high
i
can
not
endure
it
she
opened
the
top
of
the
range
and
as
the
cremation
was
going
on
i
continued
my
comments
why
in
all
my
life
i
never
knew
anything
like
it
wherever
i
put
it
in
pantry
swing
cupboard
on
the
cellar
stairs
in
a
tin
box
on
top
of
the
refrigerator
way
out
on
that
just
then
tom
opened
the
door
and
said
miss
your
fertilizer
come
i
have
told
you
of
my
mistakes
failures
losses
but
have
you
any
idea
of
my
daily
delights
my
lasting
gains
from
invalidism
to
health
from
mental
depression
to
exuberant
spirits
that
is
the
blessed
record
of
two
years
of
amateur
farming
what
has
done
this
exercise
actual
hard
work
digging
in
the
dirt
we
are
made
of
dust
and
the
closer
our
companionship
with
mother
earth
in
summer
time
the
longer
we
shall
keep
above
ground
then
the
freedom
from
conventional
restraints
of
dress
no
necessity
for
crimps
no
need
of
foreign
hirsute
adornment
no
dresses
with
tight
arm
holes
and
trailing
skirts
no
slippers
with
pointed
toes
but
comfort
clear
comfort
indoors
and
out
plenty
of
rocking
chairs
lounges
that
make
one
sleepy
just
to
look
at
them
open
fires
in
every
room
and
nothing
too
fine
for
the
sun
to
glorify
butter
eggs
cream
vegetables
poultry
simply
perfect
and
the
rare
ecstatic
privilege
of
eating
onions
onions
raw
boiled
baked
and
fried
at
any
hour
or
all
hours
i
said
comfort
it
is
luxury
holmes
says
i
have
seen
respectability
and
amiability
grouped
over
the
stove
i
have
seen
virtue
and
intelligence
hovering
over
the
register
but
i
have
never
seen
true
happiness
in
a
family
circle
where
the
faces
were
not
illuminated
by
the
blaze
of
an
open
fireplace
and
nature
i
could
fill
pages
with
glowing
descriptions
of
days
outdoors
in
my
own
homely
pasture
i
have
found
the
dainty
wild
rose
the
little
field
strawberries
so
fragrant
and
spicy
the
blue
berries
high
and
low
so
desirable
for
and
daisies
and
ferns
in
abundance
and
in
an
adjoining
meadow
by
the
brookside
the
cardinal
flower
and
the
blue
gentian
all
these
simple
pleasures
seem
better
to
me
than
sitting
in
heated
crowded
rooms
listening
to
interminable
music
or
to
men
or
women
who
never
know
when
to
stop
or
rushing
round
to
gain
more
information
on
anything
and
everything
from
alaska
to
zululand
and
wildly
struggling
to
catch
up
with
social
duties
city
friends
looking
at
the
other
side
of
the
shield
marvel
at
my
contentment
and
regard
me
as
buried
alive
but
when
i
go
back
for
a
short
time
to
the
old
life
i
am
fairly
homesick
i
miss
my
daily
visit
to
the
cows
and
the
frolic
with
the
dogs
all
that
has
been
unpleasant
fades
like
a
dream
i
think
of
the
delicious
morning
hours
on
the
broad
piazza
the
evenings
with
their
starry
splendor
or
witching
moonlight
the
nights
of
sound
sleep
and
refreshing
rest
the
picnics
the
jolly
drives
with
friends
as
charmed
with
country
life
as
myself
and
i
weary
of
social
functions
and
overpowering
intellectual
privileges
and
every
other
advantage
of
the
metropolis
and
long
to
migrate
once
more
from
gotham
to
gooseville
dear
country
life
of
child
and
man
for
both
the
best
the
strongest
that
with
the
earliest
race
began
and
hast
outlived
the
longest
their
cities
perished
long
ago
who
the
first
farmers
were
we
know
the
end
