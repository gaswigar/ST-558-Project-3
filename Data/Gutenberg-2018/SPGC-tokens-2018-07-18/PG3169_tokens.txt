of
the

bangs
chapter
i
the
associated
shades
take
action
the
of
the
associated
shades
formerly
located
upon
the
river
styx
as
the
reader
may
possibly
remember
had
been
torn
from
its
moorings
and
navigated
out
into
unknown
seas
by
that
vengeful
pirate
captain
kidd
aided
and
abetted
by
some
of
the
most
ruffianly
inhabitants
of
hades
like
a
thief
in
the
night
had
they
come
and
for
no
better
reason
than
that
the
captain
had
been
unanimously
voted
a
shade
too
shady
to
associate
with
spirits
had
they
made
off
with
the
happy
floating
of
their
betters
and
worst
of
all
with
them
by
force
of
circumstances
over
which
they
had
no
control
had
sailed
also
the
fair
queen
elizabeth
the
spirited
xanthippe
and
every
other
and
beautiful
woman
of
erebean
society
whereby
the
men
thereof
were
rendered
desolate
i
ca
stand
it
cried
raleigh
desperately
as
with
his
accustomed
grace
he
presided
over
a
special
meeting
of
the
club
called
on
the
bank
of
the
inky
stygian
stream
at
the
point
where
the
missing
boat
had
been
moored
think
of
it
gentlemen
elizabeth
of
england
calpurnia
of
rome
ophelia
of
denmark
and
every
precious
jewel
in
our
social
diadem
gone
vanished
completely
and
with
whom
kidd
of
all
men
in
the
universe
kidd
the
pirate
the
ruffian
do
take
on
so
my
dear
sir
walter
said
socrates
cheerfully
what
the
use
of
going
into
hysterics
you
are
not
a
woman
and
should
eschew
that
luxury
xanthippe
is
with
them
and
i
warrant
you
that
when
that
cherished
spouse
of
mine
has
recovered
from
the
effects
of
the
sea
say
the
third
day
out
kidd
and
his
crew
will
be
walking
the
plank
and
voluntarily
at
that
but
the
itself
murmured
noah
sadly
that
was
my
delight
it
reminded
me
in
some
respects
of
the
ark
the
law
of
compensation
enters
in
there
my
dear
commodore
retorted
socrates
for
me
with
xanthippe
abroad
i
do
not
need
a
club
to
go
to
i
can
stay
at
home
and
take
my
hemlock
in
peace
and
straight
xanthippe
always
compelled
me
to
dilute
it
at
the
rate
of
one
quart
of
water
to
the
finger
well
we
did
all
marry
xanthippe
put
in
caesar
firmly
therefore
we
are
not
all
satisfied
with
the
situation
i
for
one
quite
agree
with
sir
walter
that
something
must
be
done
and
quickly
are
we
to
sit
here
and
do
nothing
allowing
that
fiend
to
kidnap
our
wives
with
impunity
not
at
all
interposed
bonaparte
the
time
for
action
has
arrived
all
things
considered
he
is
welcome
to
marie
louise
but
the
idea
of
josephine
going
off
on
a
cruise
of
that
kind
breaks
my
heart
no
question
about
it
observed
johnson
we
got
to
do
something
if
it
is
only
for
the
sake
of
appearances
the
question
really
is
what
shall
be
done
first
i
am
in
favor
of
taking
a
drink
as
the
first
step
and
considering
the
matter
of
further
action
afterwards
suggested
shakespeare
and
it
was
this
suggestion
that
made
the
members
unanimous
upon
the
necessity
for
immediate
action
for
when
the
assembled
spirits
called
for
their
various
favorite
beverages
it
was
found
that
there
were
none
to
be
had
it
being
sunday
and
all
the
establishments
wherein
liquid
refreshments
were
licensed
to
be
sold
being
closed
for
at
the
time
of
writing
the
local
government
of
hades
was
in
the
hands
of
the
reform
party
what
cried
socrates
nothing
but
styx
water
and
vitriol
sundays
then
the
must
be
recovered
whether
xanthippe
comes
with
it
or
not
sir
walter
i
am
for
immediate
action
after
all
this
ruffian
should
be
captured
at
once
and
made
an
example
of
excuse
me
socrates
put
in
lindley
murray
but
ah
pray
speak
in
greek
hereafter
will
you
please
when
you
attempt
english
you
have
a
beastly
way
of
working
up
to
climatic
prepositions
which
are
offensive
to
the
ear
of
a
purist
this
is
no
time
to
discuss
style
murray
interposed
sir
walter
socrates
may
speak
and
spell
like
chaucer
if
he
pleases
he
may
even
part
his
infinitives
in
the
middle
for
all
i
care
we
have
affairs
of
greater
moment
in
hand
we
must
ransack
the
earth
cried
socrates
until
we
find
that
boat
i
dry
as
a
fish
there
he
goes
again
growled
murray
dry
as
a
fish
what
fish
i
like
to
know
is
dry
red
herrings
retorted
socrates
and
there
was
a
great
laugh
at
the
expense
of
the
purist
in
which
even
hamlet
who
had
grown
more
and
more
melancholy
and
morbid
since
the
abduction
of
ophelia
joined
then
it
is
settled
said
raleigh
something
must
be
done
and
now
the
point
is
what
relief
expeditions
have
a
way
of
finding
things
suggested
livingstone
or
rather
of
being
found
by
the
things
they
go
out
to
relieve
i
propose
that
we
send
out
a
number
of
them
i
will
take
africa
bonaparte
can
lead
an
expedition
into
europe
general
washington
may
have
north
america
and
i
beg
pardon
put
in
johnson
but
have
you
any
idea
livingstone
that
captain
kidd
has
put
wheels
on
this
of
ours
and
is
having
it
dragged
across
the
sahara
by
mules
or
camels
no
such
absurd
idea
ever
entered
my
head
retorted
the
doctor
do
you
then
believe
that
he
has
put
runners
on
it
and
is
engaged
in
the
pleasurable
pastime
of
taking
the
ladies
tobogganing
down
the
alps
persisted
the
philosopher
not
at
all
why
do
you
ask
queried
the
african
explorer
irritably
because
i
wish
to
know
said
johnson
that
is
always
my
motive
in
asking
questions
you
propose
to
go
looking
for
a
in
central
africa
you
suggest
that
bonaparte
lead
an
expedition
in
search
of
it
through
europe
all
of
which
strikes
me
as
nonsense
this
search
is
the
work
of
not
of
landlubbers
you
might
as
well
ask
confucius
to
look
for
it
in
the
heart
of
china
what
earthly
use
there
is
in
ransacking
the
earth
i
fail
to
see
what
we
need
is
a
navel
expedition
to
scour
the
sea
unless
it
is
pretty
well
understood
in
advance
that
we
believe
kidd
has
hauled
the
boat
out
of
the
water
and
is
now
using
it
for
a
rink
or
a
bicycle
academy
in
ohio
or
for
some
other
purpose
for
which
neither
he
nor
it
was
designed
johnson
point
is
well
taken
said
a
stranger
who
had
been
sitting
upon
the
of
the
pier
quietly
but
with
very
evident
interest
listening
to
the
discussion
he
was
a
tall
and
excessively
slender
shade
like
a
spirt
of
steam
out
of
a
teapot
as
johnson
put
it
afterwards
so
slight
he
seemed
i
have
not
the
honor
of
being
a
member
of
this
association
the
stranger
continued
but
like
all
shades
i
aspire
to
the
distinction
and
i
hold
myself
and
my
talents
at
the
disposal
of
this
club
i
fancy
it
will
not
take
us
long
to
establish
our
initial
point
which
is
that
the
gross
person
who
has
so
foully
appropriated
your
property
to
his
own
base
uses
does
not
contemplate
removing
it
from
its
keel
and
placing
it
somewhere
inland
all
the
evidence
in
hand
points
to
a
radically
different
conclusion
which
is
my
sole
reason
for
doubting
the
value
of
that
conclusion
captain
kidd
is
a
seafarer
by
instinct
not
a
landsman
the
is
not
a
house
but
a
boat
therefore
the
place
to
look
for
it
is
not
as
johnson
so
well
says
in
the
sahara
desert
or
on
the
alps
or
in
the
state
of
ohio
but
upon
the
high
sea
or
upon
the
waterfront
of
some
one
of
the
world
great
cities
and
what
then
would
be
your
plan
asked
sir
walter
impressed
by
the
stranger
manner
as
well
as
by
the
very
manifest
reason
in
all
that
he
had
said
the
chartering
of
a
suitable
vessel
fully
armed
and
equipped
for
the
purpose
of
pursuit
ascertain
whither
the
has
sailed
for
what
port
and
start
at
once
have
you
a
model
of
the
within
reach
returned
the
stranger
i
think
not
we
have
the
architect
plans
however
said
the
chairman
we
had
chairman
said
demosthenes
who
was
secretary
of
the
house
committee
rising
but
they
are
gone
with
the
itself
they
were
kept
in
the
safe
in
the
hold
a
look
of
annoyance
came
into
the
face
of
the
stranger
that
too
bad
he
said
it
was
a
most
important
part
of
my
plan
that
we
should
know
about
how
fast
the
was
humph
ejaculated
socrates
with
sarcasm
if
take
xanthippe
word
for
it
the
was
the
fastest
yacht
afloat
i
refer
to
the
matter
of
speed
in
sailing
returned
the
stranger
quietly
the
question
of
its
ethical
speed
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
the
designer
of
the
craft
is
here
said
sir
walter
fixing
his
eyes
upon
sir
christopher
wren
it
is
possible
that
he
may
be
of
assistance
in
settling
that
point
what
has
all
this
got
to
do
with
the
question
anyhow
mr
chairman
asked
solomon
rising
impatiently
and
addressing
sir
walter
we
are
preparing
for
a
that
i
know
of
nobody
after
a
cup
or
a
championship
of
any
kind
what
we
do
want
is
to
get
our
wives
back
the
captain
has
taken
more
than
half
of
mine
along
with
him
but
i
am
interested
none
the
less
the
queen
of
sheba
is
on
board
and
i
am
somewhat
interested
in
her
fate
so
i
ask
you
what
earthly
or
unearthly
use
there
is
in
discussing
this
question
of
speed
in
the
it
strikes
me
as
a
woful
waste
of
time
and
rather
unprecedented
too
that
we
should
suspend
all
rules
and
listen
to
the
talk
of
an
entire
stranger
i
do
not
venture
to
doubt
the
wisdom
of
solomon
said
johnson
dryly
but
i
must
say
that
the
gentleman
remarks
rather
interest
me
of
course
they
do
ejaculated
solomon
he
agreed
with
you
that
ought
to
make
him
interesting
to
everybody
freaks
usually
are
that
is
not
the
reason
at
all
retorted
johnson
cold
water
agrees
with
me
but
it
does
interest
me
what
i
do
think
however
is
that
our
unknown
friend
seems
to
have
a
grasp
on
the
situation
by
which
we
are
confronted
and
he
going
at
the
matter
in
hand
in
a
very
comprehensive
fashion
i
move
therefore
that
solomon
be
laid
on
the
table
and
that
the
privileges
of
the
ah
of
the
wharf
be
extended
indefinitely
to
our
friend
on
the
piece
the
motion
having
been
seconded
was
duly
carried
and
the
stranger
resumed
i
will
explain
for
the
benefit
of
his
majesty
king
solomon
whose
wisdom
i
have
always
admired
and
whose
endurance
as
the
husband
of
three
hundred
wives
has
filled
me
with
wonder
he
said
that
before
starting
in
pursuit
of
the
stolen
vessel
we
must
select
a
craft
of
some
sort
for
the
purpose
and
that
in
selecting
the
pursuer
it
is
quite
essential
that
we
should
choose
a
vessel
of
greater
speed
than
the
one
we
desire
to
overtake
it
would
hardly
be
proper
i
think
if
the
can
sail
four
knots
an
hour
to
attempt
to
overhaul
her
with
a
launch
or
other
nautical
craft
with
a
maximum
speed
of
two
knots
an
hour
hear
hear
ejaculated
caesar
that
is
my
reason
your
majesty
for
inquiring
as
to
the
speed
of
your
late
said
the
stranger
bowing
courteously
to
solomon
now
if
sir
christopher
wren
can
give
me
her
measurements
we
can
very
soon
determine
at
about
what
rate
she
is
leaving
us
behind
under
favorable
circumstances
is
necessary
for
sir
christopher
to
do
anything
of
the
sort
said
noah
rising
and
manifesting
somewhat
more
heat
than
the
occasion
seemed
to
require
as
long
as
we
are
discussing
the
question
i
will
take
the
liberty
of
stating
what
i
have
never
mentioned
before
that
the
designer
of
the
merely
appropriated
the
lines
of
the
ark
shem
ham
and
japhet
will
bear
testimony
to
the
truth
of
that
statement
there
can
be
no
quarrel
on
that
score
chairman
assented
sir
christopher
with
cutting
frigidity
i
am
perfectly
willing
to
admit
that
practically
the
two
vessels
were
built
on
the
same
lines
but
with
modifications
which
would
enable
my
boat
to
sail
twenty
miles
to
windward
and
back
in
six
days
less
time
than
it
would
have
taken
the
ark
to
cover
the
same
distance
and
it
could
have
taken
all
the
wash
of
the
excursion
steamers
into
the
bargain
bosh
ejaculated
noah
angrily
strip
your
old
tub
down
to
a
flying
and
a
and
ballast
the
ark
with
elephants
until
every
inch
of
her
reeked
with
ivory
and
peanuts
and
she
outfoot
you
on
every
leg
in
a
cyclone
or
a
zephyr
give
me
the
ark
and
a
breeze
and
your
would
be
within
hailing
distance
of
her
five
minutes
after
the
start
if
she
had
square
yards
of
canvas
spread
before
a
gale
this
discussion
is
waxing
very
unprofitable
observed
confucius
if
these
gentlemen
can
not
be
made
to
confine
themselves
to
the
subject
that
is
agitating
this
body
i
move
we
call
in
the
authorities
and
have
them
confined
in
the
bottomless
pit
i
did
not
precipitate
the
quarrel
said
noah
i
was
merely
trying
to
assist
our
friend
on
the
i
was
going
to
say
that
as
the
ark
was
probably
a
hundred
times
faster
than
sir
christopher
wren
tub
which
he
himself
says
can
take
care
of
all
the
wash
of
the
excursion
boats
thereby
becoming
on
his
own
admission
a
tub
order
order
cried
sir
christopher
i
was
going
to
say
that
this
could
be
overhauled
by
a
launch
or
any
other
craft
with
a
speed
of
thirty
knots
a
mouth
continued
noah
ignoring
the
interruption
took
him
forty
days
to
get
to
mount
ararat
sneered
sir
christopher
well
your
boat
would
have
got
there
two
weeks
sooner
i
admit
retorted
noah
if
she
sprung
a
leak
at
the
right
time
granting
the
truth
of
noah
statement
said
sir
walter
motioning
to
the
angry
architect
to
be
quiet
not
that
we
take
any
side
in
the
issue
between
the
two
gentlemen
but
merely
for
the
sake
of
wish
to
ask
the
stranger
who
has
been
good
enough
to
interest
himself
in
our
trouble
what
he
proposes
to
do
how
can
you
establish
your
course
in
case
a
boat
were
provided
also
vot
vill
be
dher
gost
if
any
put
in
shylock
a
murmur
of
disapprobation
greeted
this
remark
the
cost
need
not
trouble
you
sir
said
sir
walter
indignantly
addressing
the
stranger
you
will
have
carte
blanche
den
ve
are
ruint
cried
shylock
displaying
his
palms
and
showing
by
that
act
a
select
assortment
of
diamond
rings
oh
laughed
the
stranger
that
is
a
simple
matter
captain
kidd
has
gone
to
london
to
london
cried
several
members
at
once
how
do
you
know
that
by
this
said
the
stranger
holding
up
the
tiny
stub
end
of
a
cigar
ejaculated
solomon
what
child
play
is
this
no
your
majesty
observed
the
stranger
it
is
not
child
play
it
is
fact
that
cigar
end
was
thrown
aside
here
on
the
wharf
by
captain
kidd
just
before
he
stepped
on
board
the
how
do
you
know
that
demanded
raleigh
and
granting
the
truth
of
the
assertion
what
does
it
prove
i
will
tell
you
said
the
stranger
and
he
at
once
proceeded
as
follows
chapter
ii
the
stranger
unravels
a
mystery
and
reveals
himself
i
have
made
a
hobby
of
the
study
of
cigar
ends
said
the
stranger
as
the
associated
shades
settled
back
to
hear
his
account
of
himself
from
my
earliest
youth
when
i
used
surreptitiously
to
remove
the
unsmoked
ends
of
my
father
cigars
and
break
them
up
and
in
hiding
smoke
them
in
an
old
clay
pipe
which
i
had
presented
to
me
by
an
ancient
of
my
acquaintance
i
have
been
interested
in
tobacco
in
all
forms
even
including
these
despised
unsmoked
ends
for
they
convey
to
my
mind
messages
sentiments
farces
comedies
and
tragedies
which
to
your
minds
would
never
become
manifest
through
their
agency
the
company
drew
closer
together
and
formed
themselves
in
a
more
compact
mass
about
the
speaker
it
was
evident
that
they
were
beginning
to
feel
an
unusual
interest
in
this
extraordinary
person
who
had
come
among
them
unheralded
and
unknown
even
shylock
stopped
calculating
percentages
for
an
instant
to
listen
do
you
mean
to
tell
us
demanded
shakespeare
that
the
unsmoked
stub
of
a
cigar
will
suggest
the
story
of
him
who
smoked
it
to
your
mind
i
do
replied
the
stranger
with
a
confident
smile
take
this
one
for
instance
that
i
have
picked
up
here
upon
the
wharf
it
tells
me
the
whole
story
of
the
intentions
of
captain
kidd
at
the
moment
when
in
utter
disregard
of
your
rights
he
stepped
aboard
your
and
in
his
usual
piratical
fashion
made
off
with
it
into
unknown
seas
but
how
do
you
know
he
smoked
it
asked
solomon
who
deemed
it
the
part
of
wisdom
to
be
suspicious
of
the
stranger
there
are
two
curious
indentations
in
it
which
prove
that
the
marks
of
two
teeth
with
a
hiatus
between
which
you
will
see
if
you
look
closely
said
the
stranger
handing
the
small
bit
of
tobacco
to
sir
walter
make
that
point
evident
beyond
peradventure
the
captain
lost
an
in
one
of
his
later
raids
it
was
knocked
out
by
a
which
had
been
hurled
at
him
by
one
of
the
crew
of
the
he
and
his
followers
had
attacked
the
adjacent
teeth
were
broken
but
not
removed
the
cigar
end
bears
the
marks
of
those
two
jagged
molars
with
the
hiatus
which
as
i
have
indicated
is
due
to
the
destruction
of
the
between
them
it
is
not
likely
that
there
was
another
man
in
the
pirate
crew
with
teeth
exactly
like
the
commander
therefore
i
say
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
cigar
end
was
that
of
the
captain
himself
very
interesting
indeed
observed
blackstone
removing
his
wig
and
fanning
himself
with
it
but
i
must
confess
chairman
that
in
any
properly
constituted
law
court
this
evidence
would
long
since
have
been
ruled
out
as
irrelevant
and
absurd
the
idea
of
two
or
three
hundred
dignified
spirits
like
ourselves
gathered
together
to
devise
a
means
for
the
recovery
of
our
property
and
the
rescue
of
our
wives
yielding
the
floor
to
the
delivering
of
a
lecture
by
an
entire
stranger
on
ends
he
has
met
strikes
me
as
ridiculous
in
the
extreme
of
what
earthly
interest
is
it
to
us
to
know
that
this
or
that
cigar
was
smoked
by
captain
kidd
merely
that
it
will
help
us
on
your
honor
to
discover
the
whereabouts
of
the
said
kidd
interposed
the
stranger
it
is
by
trifles
seeming
trifles
that
the
greatest
detective
work
is
done
my
friends
le
coq
hawkshaw
and
old
sleuth
will
bear
me
out
in
this
i
think
however
much
in
other
respects
our
methods
may
have
differed
they
left
no
stone
unturned
in
the
pursuit
of
a
criminal
no
detail
however
trifling
uncared
for
no
more
should
we
in
the
present
instance
overlook
the
minutest
bit
of
evidence
however
irrelevant
and
absurd
at
first
blush
it
may
appear
to
be
the
truth
of
what
i
say
was
very
effectually
proven
in
the
strange
case
of
the
brokedale
tiara
in
which
i
figured
somewhat
conspicuously
but
which
have
never
made
public
because
it
involves
a
secret
affecting
the
integrity
of
one
of
the
noblest
families
in
the
british
empire
i
really
believe
that
mystery
was
solved
easily
and
at
once
because
i
happened
to
remember
that
the
number
of
my
watch
was
how
trivial
and
yet
how
important
it
was
to
what
then
transpired
you
will
realize
when
i
tell
you
the
incident
the
stranger
manner
was
so
impressive
that
there
was
a
unanimous
and
simultaneous
movement
upon
the
part
of
all
present
to
get
up
closer
so
as
the
more
readily
to
hear
what
he
said
as
a
result
of
which
poor
old
boswell
was
pushed
overboard
and
fell
with
a
loud
splash
into
the
styx
fortunately
however
one
of
was
close
at
hand
and
in
a
short
while
the
dripping
sputtering
spirit
was
drawn
into
it
wrung
out
and
sent
home
to
dry
the
excitement
attending
this
diversion
having
subsided
solomon
asked
what
was
the
incident
of
the
lost
tiara
i
am
about
to
tell
you
returned
the
stranger
and
it
must
be
understood
that
you
are
told
in
the
strictest
confidence
for
as
i
say
the
incident
involves
a
state
secret
of
great
magnitude
in
life
in
the
mortal
life
gentlemen
i
was
a
detective
by
profession
and
if
i
do
say
it
who
perhaps
should
not
i
was
one
of
the
most
interesting
for
purely
literary
purposes
that
has
ever
been
known
i
did
not
find
it
necessary
to
go
about
saying
ha
as
le
coq
was
accustomed
to
do
to
advertise
his
cleverness
neither
did
i
disguise
myself
as
a
and
hide
under
a
for
the
purpose
of
solving
a
mystery
involving
the
abduction
of
a
parlor
stove
after
the
manner
of
the
talented
hawkshaw
by
mental
concentration
alone
without
fireworks
or
orchestral
accompaniment
of
any
sort
whatsoever
did
i
go
about
my
business
and
for
that
very
reason
many
of
my
were
forced
to
go
out
of
real
detective
work
into
that
line
of
the
business
with
which
the
stage
has
familiarized
the
most
of
us
a
line
in
which
nothing
but
stupidity
luck
and
a
yellow
wig
is
required
of
him
who
pursues
it
this
man
is
an
impostor
whispered
le
coq
to
hawkshaw
i
known
that
all
along
by
the
mole
on
his
left
wrist
returned
hawkshaw
contemptuously
i
suspected
it
the
minute
i
saw
he
was
not
disguised
returned
le
coq
knowingly
i
have
observed
that
the
greatest
villains
latterly
have
discarded
disguises
as
being
too
easily
penetrated
and
therefore
of
no
avail
and
merely
a
useless
expense
silence
cried
confucius
impatiently
how
can
the
gentleman
proceed
with
all
this
conversation
going
on
in
the
rear
hawkshaw
and
le
coq
immediately
subsided
and
the
stranger
went
on
it
was
in
this
way
that
i
treated
the
strange
case
of
the
lost
tiara
resumed
the
stranger
mental
concentration
upon
seemingly
insignificant
details
alone
enabled
me
to
bring
about
the
desired
results
in
that
instance
a
brief
outline
of
the
case
is
as
follows
it
was
late
one
evening
in
the
early
spring
of
the
london
season
was
at
its
height
dances
fetes
of
all
kinds
opera
and
the
theatres
were
in
full
blast
when
all
of
a
sudden
society
was
paralyzed
by
a
most
audacious
robbery
a
diamond
tiara
valued
at
pounds
sterling
had
been
stolen
from
the
duchess
of
brokedale
and
under
circumstances
which
threw
society
itself
and
every
individual
in
it
under
suspicion
even
his
royal
highness
the
prince
himself
for
he
had
danced
frequently
with
the
duchess
and
was
known
to
be
a
great
admirer
of
her
tiara
it
was
at
eleven
at
night
that
the
news
of
the
robbery
first
came
to
my
ears
i
had
been
spending
the
evening
alone
in
my
library
making
notes
for
a
second
volume
of
my
memoirs
and
feeling
somewhat
depressed
i
was
on
the
point
of
going
out
for
my
usual
midnight
walk
on
hampstead
heath
when
one
of
my
servants
hastily
entering
informed
me
of
the
robbery
i
changed
my
mind
in
respect
to
my
midnight
walk
immediately
upon
receipt
of
the
news
for
i
knew
that
before
one
some
one
would
call
upon
me
at
my
lodgings
with
reference
to
this
robbery
it
could
not
be
otherwise
any
mystery
of
such
magnitude
could
no
more
be
taken
to
another
bureau
than
elephants
could
fly
they
used
to
said
adam
i
once
had
a
whole
aviary
full
of
winged
elephants
they
flew
from
flower
to
flower
and
thrusting
their
probabilities
deep
into
their
what
queried
johnson
with
a
frown
probabilities
is
that
the
word
their
trunks
said
adam
probosces
i
imagine
you
mean
suggested
johnson
yes
that
was
it
their
probosces
said
adam
they
were
great
those
elephants
far
better
than
the
bees
because
they
could
make
so
much
more
of
it
in
a
given
time
munchausen
shook
his
head
sadly
i
afraid
i
outclassed
by
these
antediluvians
he
said
gentlemen
gentlemen
cried
sir
walter
these
interruptions
are
inexcusable
that
what
i
think
said
the
stranger
with
some
asperity
having
about
as
hard
a
time
getting
this
story
out
as
i
would
if
it
were
a
serial
of
course
if
you
gentlemen
do
not
wish
to
hear
it
i
can
stop
but
it
must
be
understood
that
when
i
do
stop
i
stop
finally
once
and
for
all
because
the
tale
has
not
a
sufficiency
of
dramatic
climaxes
to
warrant
its
prolongation
over
the
usual
magazine
period
of
twelve
months
go
on
go
on
cried
some
shut
up
cried
others
addressing
the
interrupting
members
of
course
as
i
was
saying
resumed
the
stranger
i
felt
confident
that
within
an
hour
in
some
way
or
other
that
case
would
be
placed
in
my
hands
it
would
be
mine
either
positively
or
negatively
that
is
to
say
either
the
person
robbed
would
employ
me
to
ferret
out
the
mystery
and
recover
the
diamonds
or
the
robber
himself
actuated
by
motives
of
would
endeavor
to
direct
my
energies
into
other
channels
until
he
should
have
the
time
to
dispose
of
his
booty
a
mental
discussion
of
the
probabilities
inclined
me
to
believe
that
the
latter
would
be
the
case
i
reasoned
in
this
fashion
the
person
robbed
is
of
exalted
rank
she
can
not
move
rapidly
because
she
is
so
great
bodies
move
slowly
it
is
probable
that
it
will
be
a
week
before
according
to
the
etiquette
by
which
she
is
hedged
about
she
can
communicate
with
me
in
the
first
place
she
must
inform
one
of
her
attendants
that
she
has
been
robbed
he
must
communicate
the
news
to
the
functionary
in
charge
of
her
residence
who
will
communicate
with
the
home
secretary
and
from
him
will
issue
the
orders
to
the
police
who
baffled
at
every
step
will
finally
address
themselves
to
me
give
that
side
two
weeks
i
said
on
the
other
hand
the
robber
will
he
allow
himself
to
be
lulled
into
a
false
sense
of
security
by
counting
on
this
delay
or
will
he
not
noting
my
habit
of
occasionally
entering
upon
detective
enterprises
of
this
nature
of
my
own
volition
come
to
me
at
once
and
set
me
to
work
ferreting
out
some
crime
that
has
never
been
committed
my
feeling
was
that
this
would
happen
and
i
pulled
out
my
watch
to
see
if
it
were
not
nearly
time
for
him
to
arrive
the
robbery
had
taken
place
at
a
state
ball
at
the
buckingham
palace
i
mused
has
had
an
hour
and
forty
minutes
to
get
here
it
is
now
he
should
be
here
by
i
will
wait
and
hastily
swallowing
a
cocaine
tablet
to
nerve
myself
up
for
the
meeting
i
sat
down
and
began
to
read
my
schopenhauer
hardly
had
i
perused
a
page
when
there
came
a
tap
upon
my
door
i
rose
with
a
smile
for
i
thought
i
knew
what
was
to
happen
opened
the
door
and
there
stood
much
to
my
surprise
the
husband
of
the
lady
whose
tiara
was
missing
it
was
the
duke
of
brokedale
himself
it
is
true
he
was
disguised
his
beard
was
powdered
until
it
looked
like
snow
and
he
wore
a
wig
and
a
pair
of
green
goggles
but
i
recognized
him
at
once
by
his
lack
of
manners
which
is
an
unmistakable
sign
of
nobility
as
i
opened
the
door
he
began
are
am
i
replied
in
you
have
come
to
see
me
about
your
stolen
watch
it
is
a
gold
watch
with
a
swiss
movement
loses
five
minutes
a
day
and
the
back
cover
which
does
not
bear
any
inscription
has
upon
it
the
indentations
made
by
the
molars
of
your
son
willie
when
that
interesting
youth
was
cutting
his
teeth
upon
it
wonderful
cried
johnson
may
i
ask
how
you
knew
all
that
asked
solomon
deeply
impressed
such
penetration
strikes
me
as
marvellous
i
did
know
it
replied
the
stranger
with
a
smile
what
i
said
was
intended
to
be
jocular
and
to
put
brokedale
at
his
ease
the
americans
present
with
their
usual
astuteness
would
term
it
bluff
it
was
i
merely
rattled
on
i
simply
did
not
wish
to
offend
the
gentleman
by
letting
him
know
that
i
had
penetrated
his
disguise
imagine
my
surprise
however
when
his
eye
brightened
as
i
spoke
and
he
entered
my
room
with
such
alacrity
that
half
the
powder
which
he
thought
disguised
his
beard
was
shaken
off
on
to
the
floor
sitting
down
in
the
chair
i
had
just
vacated
he
quietly
remarked
are
a
wonderful
man
sir
how
did
you
know
that
i
had
lost
my
watch
for
a
moment
i
was
nonplussed
more
than
that
i
was
completely
staggered
i
had
expected
him
to
say
at
once
that
he
had
not
lost
his
watch
but
had
come
to
see
me
about
the
tiara
and
to
have
him
take
my
words
seriously
was
entirely
unexpected
and
overwhelmingly
surprising
however
in
view
of
his
rank
i
deemed
it
well
to
fall
in
with
his
humour
as
for
that
i
replied
is
a
part
of
my
business
it
is
the
detective
place
to
know
everything
and
generally
if
he
reveals
the
machinery
by
means
of
which
he
reaches
his
conclusions
he
is
a
fool
since
his
method
is
his
secret
and
his
secret
his
i
do
not
mind
telling
you
however
that
i
knew
your
watch
was
stolen
by
your
anxious
glance
at
my
clock
which
showed
that
you
wished
to
know
the
time
now
most
rich
americans
have
watches
for
that
purpose
and
have
no
hesitation
about
showing
them
if
you
had
a
watch
you
have
looked
at
it
not
at
my
clock
my
visitor
laughed
and
repeated
what
he
had
said
about
my
being
a
wonderful
man
the
dents
which
my
son
made
cutting
his
teeth
he
added
go
with
an
american
watch
rubber
or
ivory
rings
are
good
enough
for
american
babies
to
chew
on
said
i
must
have
gold
watches
or
nothing
finally
how
did
you
know
i
was
a
rich
american
he
asked
no
other
can
afford
to
stop
at
hotels
like
the
savoy
in
the
height
of
the
season
i
replied
thinking
that
the
jest
would
end
there
and
that
he
would
now
reveal
his
identity
and
speak
of
the
tiara
to
my
surprise
however
he
did
nothing
of
the
sort
have
an
almost
supernatural
gift
he
said
name
is
bunker
i
am
stopping
at
the
savoy
i
am
an
american
i
was
rich
when
i
arrived
here
but
i
not
quite
so
bloated
with
wealth
as
i
was
now
that
i
have
paid
my
first
week
bill
i
have
lost
my
watch
such
a
watch
too
as
you
describe
even
to
the
dents
your
only
mistake
was
that
the
dents
were
made
by
my
son
john
and
not
willie
but
even
there
i
can
not
but
wonder
at
you
for
john
and
willie
are
twins
and
so
much
alike
that
it
sometimes
baffles
even
their
mother
to
tell
them
apart
the
watch
has
no
very
great
value
intrinsically
but
the
associations
are
such
that
i
want
it
back
and
i
will
pay
pounds
for
its
recovery
i
have
no
clew
as
to
who
took
it
it
was
numbered
here
a
happy
thought
struck
me
in
all
my
description
of
the
watch
i
had
merely
described
my
own
a
very
cheap
affair
which
i
had
won
at
a
raffle
my
visitor
was
deceiving
me
though
for
what
purpose
i
did
not
on
the
instant
divine
no
one
would
like
to
suspect
him
of
having
purloined
his
wife
tiara
why
should
i
not
deceive
him
and
at
the
same
time
get
rid
of
my
poor
chronometer
for
a
sum
that
exceeded
its
value
a
hundredfold
good
business
cried
shylock
the
stranger
smiled
and
bowed
excellent
he
said
i
took
the
words
right
out
of
his
mouth
was
numbered
i
cried
giving
of
course
the
number
of
my
own
watch
he
gazed
at
me
narrowly
for
a
moment
and
then
he
smiled
grow
more
marvellous
at
every
step
that
was
indeed
the
number
are
you
a
demon
i
replied
something
of
a
well
to
be
brief
the
bargain
was
struck
i
was
to
look
for
a
watch
that
i
knew
he
had
lost
and
was
to
receive
pounds
if
i
found
it
it
seemed
to
him
to
be
a
very
good
bargain
as
indeed
it
was
from
his
point
of
view
feeling
as
he
did
that
there
never
having
been
any
such
watch
it
could
not
be
recovered
and
little
suspecting
that
two
could
play
at
his
little
game
of
deception
and
that
under
any
circumstances
i
could
foist
a
watch
upon
him
for
two
hundred
pounds
this
business
concluded
he
started
to
go
you
have
a
little
scotch
i
asked
as
he
started
feeling
with
all
that
prospective
profit
in
view
i
could
well
afford
the
expense
is
a
stormy
night
i
will
said
he
returning
and
seating
himself
by
my
table
still
to
my
surprise
keeping
his
hat
on
me
take
your
hat
i
said
little
thinking
that
my
courtesy
would
reveal
the
true
state
of
affairs
the
mere
mention
of
the
word
hat
brought
about
a
terrible
change
in
my
visitor
his
knees
trembled
his
face
grew
ghastly
and
he
clutched
the
brim
of
his
beaver
until
it
cracked
he
then
nervously
removed
it
and
i
noticed
a
dull
red
mark
running
about
his
forehead
just
as
there
would
be
on
the
forehead
of
a
man
whose
hat
fitted
too
tightly
and
that
mark
gentlemen
had
the
undulating
outline
of
nothing
more
nor
less
than
a
tiara
and
on
the
apex
of
the
uttermost
extremity
was
a
deep
indentation
about
the
size
of
a
shilling
that
could
have
been
made
only
by
some
adamantine
substance
the
mystery
was
solved
the
robber
of
the
duchess
of
brokedale
stood
before
me
a
suppressed
murmur
of
excitement
went
through
the
assembled
spirits
and
even
hawkshaw
and
le
coq
were
silent
in
the
presence
of
such
genius
my
plan
of
action
was
immediately
formulated
the
man
was
completely
at
my
mercy
he
had
stolen
the
tiara
and
had
it
concealed
in
the
lining
of
his
hat
i
rose
and
locked
the
door
my
visitor
sank
with
a
groan
into
my
chair
did
you
do
that
he
stammered
as
i
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
keep
my
scotch
whiskey
from
evaporating
i
said
dryly
my
lord
i
added
will
pay
your
grace
to
let
me
have
your
hat
i
know
who
you
are
you
are
the
duke
of
brokedale
the
duchess
of
brokedale
has
lost
a
valuable
tiara
of
diamonds
and
you
have
not
lost
your
watch
somebody
has
stolen
the
diamonds
and
it
may
be
that
somewhere
there
is
a
bunker
who
has
lost
such
a
watch
as
i
have
described
the
queer
part
of
it
all
is
i
continued
handing
him
the
decanter
and
taking
a
couple
of
loaded
out
of
my
escritoire
queer
part
of
it
all
is
that
i
have
the
watch
and
you
have
the
tiara
we
swap
the
swag
hand
over
the
bauble
please
he
began
wo
have
any
butting
your
grace
said
i
give
you
the
watch
and
you
need
mind
the
pounds
and
you
must
give
me
the
tiara
or
i
accompany
you
forthwith
to
the
police
and
have
a
search
made
of
your
hat
it
wo
pay
you
to
defy
me
give
it
up
he
gave
up
the
hat
at
once
and
as
i
suspected
there
lay
the
tiara
snugly
stowed
away
behind
the
are
a
great
fellow
said
i
as
i
held
the
tiara
up
to
the
light
and
watched
with
pleasure
the
flashing
brilliance
of
its
gems
beg
you
not
expose
me
he
moaned
was
driven
to
it
by
necessity
i
i
replied
long
as
you
play
fair
it
will
be
all
right
i
not
going
to
keep
this
thing
i
not
married
and
so
have
no
use
for
such
a
trifle
but
what
i
do
intend
is
simply
to
wait
until
your
wife
retains
me
to
find
it
and
then
i
find
it
and
get
the
reward
if
you
keep
perfectly
still
i
have
it
found
in
such
a
fashion
that
you
never
be
suspected
if
on
the
other
hand
you
say
a
word
about
events
i
hand
you
over
to
the
police
he
said
could
prove
a
case
against
me
can
prove
any
case
against
anybody
i
retorted
you
believe
it
read
my
book
i
added
and
i
handed
him
a
copy
of
my
memoirs
read
it
he
answered
i
ought
to
have
known
better
than
to
come
here
i
thought
you
were
only
a
literary
success
and
with
a
sigh
he
took
the
watch
and
went
out
ten
days
later
i
was
retained
by
the
duchess
and
after
a
pretended
search
of
ten
days
more
i
found
the
tiara
restored
it
to
the
noble
lady
and
received
the
pounds
reward
the
duke
kept
perfectly
quiet
about
our
little
encounter
and
afterwards
we
became
stanch
friends
for
he
was
a
good
fellow
and
was
driven
to
his
desperate
deed
only
by
the
demands
of
his
creditors
and
the
following
christmas
he
sent
me
the
watch
i
had
given
him
with
the
best
wishes
of
the
season
so
you
see
gentlemen
in
a
moment
by
quick
wit
and
a
mental
concentration
of
no
mean
order
combined
with
strict
observance
of
the
pettiest
details
i
ferreted
out
what
bade
fair
to
become
a
great
diamond
mystery
and
when
i
say
that
this
cigar
end
proves
certain
things
to
my
mind
it
does
not
become
you
to
doubt
the
value
of
my
conclusions
hear
hear
cried
raleigh
growing
tumultuous
with
enthusiasm
your
name
your
name
came
from
all
parts
of
the
wharf
the
stranger
putting
his
hand
into
the
folds
of
his
coat
drew
forth
a
bundle
of
business
cards
which
he
tossed
as
the
prestidigitator
tosses
out
among
the
audience
and
on
each
of
them
was
found
printed
the
words
sherlock
holmes
detective
ferreting
done
here
plots
for
sale
i
think
he
made
a
mistake
in
not
taking
the
pounds
for
the
watch
such
carelessness
destroys
my
confidence
in
him
said
shylock
who
was
the
first
to
recover
from
the
surprise
of
the
revelation
chapter
iii
the
is
organized
well
holmes
said
sir
walter
raleigh
after
three
rousing
cheers
led
by
hamlet
had
been
given
with
a
will
by
the
assembled
spirits
after
this
demonstration
in
your
honor
i
think
it
is
hardly
necessary
for
me
to
assure
you
of
our
hearty
in
anything
you
may
venture
to
suggest
there
is
still
manifest
however
some
desire
on
the
part
of
the
king
solomon
and
my
friend
confucius
to
know
how
you
deduce
that
kidd
has
sailed
for
london
from
the
cigar
end
which
you
hold
in
your
hand
i
can
easily
satisfy
their
curiosity
said
sherlock
holmes
genially
i
believe
i
have
already
proven
that
it
is
the
end
of
kidd
cigar
the
marks
of
the
teeth
have
shown
that
now
observe
how
closely
it
is
smoked
there
is
barely
enough
of
it
left
for
one
to
insert
between
his
teeth
now
captain
kidd
would
hardly
have
risked
the
edges
of
his
mustache
and
the
comfort
of
his
lips
by
smoking
a
cigar
down
to
the
very
light
if
he
had
had
another
nor
would
he
under
any
circumstances
have
smoked
it
that
far
unless
he
were
passionately
addicted
to
this
particular
brand
of
the
weed
therefore
i
say
to
you
first
this
was
his
cigar
second
it
was
the
last
one
he
had
third
he
is
a
confirmed
smoker
the
result
he
has
gone
to
the
one
place
in
the
world
where
these
connecticut
rolled
havana
cigars
for
i
recognize
this
as
one
of
them
have
a
real
popularity
and
are
therefore
more
certainly
obtainable
and
that
is
at
london
you
can
not
get
so
vile
a
cigar
as
that
outside
of
a
london
hotel
if
i
could
have
seen
a
more
of
it
i
should
have
been
able
definitely
to
locate
the
hotel
itself
the
wrappers
unroll
to
a
degree
that
varies
perceptibly
as
between
the
different
hotels
the
fortuna
cigar
can
be
smoked
a
quarter
through
before
its
wrapper
gives
way
the
felix
wrapper
goes
as
soon
as
you
light
the
cigar
whereas
the
river
fronting
on
the
thames
is
surrounded
by
a
moister
atmosphere
than
the
others
and
as
a
consequence
the
wrapper
will
hold
really
until
most
people
are
willing
to
throw
the
whole
thing
away
it
is
really
a
wonderful
art
said
solomon
the
making
of
a
connecticut
havana
cigar
laughed
holmes
not
at
all
give
me
a
head
of
lettuce
and
a
straw
and
i
make
you
a
box
i
referred
to
your
art
that
of
detection
said
solomon
your
logic
is
perfect
step
by
step
we
have
been
led
to
the
irresistible
conclusion
that
kidd
has
made
for
london
and
can
be
found
at
one
of
these
hotels
and
only
until
next
tuesday
when
he
will
take
a
house
in
the
neighborhood
of
scotland
yard
put
in
holmes
quickly
observing
a
sneer
on
hawkshaw
lips
and
hastening
to
overwhelm
him
by
further
evidence
of
his
ingenuity
when
he
gets
his
bill
he
will
open
his
piratical
eyes
so
wide
that
he
will
be
seized
with
jealousy
to
think
of
how
much
more
refined
his
profession
has
become
since
he
left
it
and
out
of
mere
pique
he
will
leave
the
hotel
and
to
show
himself
still
cleverer
than
his
modern
prototypes
he
will
leave
his
account
unpaid
with
the
result
that
the
affair
will
be
put
in
the
hands
of
the
police
under
which
circumstances
a
house
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
famous
police
headquarters
will
be
the
safest
place
he
can
find
as
was
instanced
by
the
remarkable
case
of
the
famous
penstock
bond
robbery
a
certain
churchwarden
named
hinkley
having
been
appointed
cashier
thereof
robbed
the
penstock
imperial
bank
of
pounds
in
bonds
and
fleeing
to
london
actually
joined
the
detective
force
at
scotland
yard
and
was
detailed
to
find
himself
which
of
course
he
never
did
nor
would
he
ever
have
been
found
had
he
not
crossed
my
path
hawkshaw
gazed
mournfully
off
into
space
and
le
coq
muttered
profane
words
under
his
breath
we
not
in
the
same
class
with
this
fellow
hawkshaw
said
le
coq
you
could
tap
your
forehead
knowingly
eight
hours
a
day
through
all
eternity
with
a
without
loosening
an
idea
like
that
nevertheless
i
confound
him
yet
growled
the
jealous
detective
i
shall
myself
go
to
london
and
disguised
as
captain
kidd
will
lead
this
visionary
on
until
he
comes
there
to
arrest
me
and
when
these
club
members
discover
that
it
is
hawkshaw
and
not
kidd
he
has
run
to
earth
we
have
a
great
laugh
on
sherlock
holmes
i
am
anxious
to
hear
how
you
solved
the
mystery
said
socrates
wrapping
his
toga
closely
about
him
and
settling
back
against
one
of
the
spiles
of
the
wharf
so
are
we
all
said
sir
walter
but
meantime
the
is
getting
farther
away
not
unless
she
sailing
backwards
sneered
noah
who
was
still
nursing
his
resentment
against
sir
christopher
wren
for
his
reflections
upon
the
speed
of
the
ark
what
the
hurry
asked
socrates
i
believe
in
making
haste
slowly
and
on
the
admission
of
our
two
eminent
naval
architects
sir
christopher
and
noah
neither
of
their
vessels
can
travel
more
than
a
mile
a
week
and
if
we
charter
the
flying
dutchman
to
go
in
pursuit
of
her
we
can
catch
her
before
she
gets
out
of
the
styx
into
the
atlantic
jonah
might
lend
us
his
whale
if
the
beast
is
in
commission
suggested
munchausen
dryly
i
for
one
would
rather
take
a
room
in
jonah
whale
than
go
aboard
the
flying
dutchman
again
i
made
one
trip
on
the
dutchman
and
she
worse
than
a
dory
for
comfort
further
i
do
see
what
good
it
would
do
us
to
charter
a
boat
that
ca
land
oftener
than
once
in
seven
years
and
spends
most
of
her
time
trying
to
double
the
cape
of
good
hope
my
whale
is
in
commission
said
jonah
with
dignity
but
baron
munchausen
need
not
consider
the
question
of
taking
a
aboard
of
her
she
does
carry
passengers
and
if
i
took
any
stock
in
the
idea
of
a
trip
on
the
flying
dutchman
amounting
to
a
seven
years
exile
i
would
cheerfully
pay
the
baron
expenses
for
a
round
trip
we
are
losing
time
gentlemen
suggested
sherlock
holmes
this
is
a
moment
i
think
when
you
should
lay
aside
personal
differences
and
personal
preferences
for
immediate
action
i
have
examined
the
wake
of
the
and
i
judge
from
the
condition
of
what
for
want
of
a
better
term
i
may
call
the
suds
when
she
left
us
the
boat
was
making
ten
knots
a
day
almost
any
craft
we
can
find
suitably
manned
ought
to
be
able
to
do
better
than
that
and
if
you
could
summon
charon
and
ascertain
what
boats
he
has
at
hand
it
would
be
for
the
good
of
all
concerned
that
a
good
plan
said
johnson
boswell
see
if
you
can
find
charon
i
am
here
already
sir
returned
the
ferryman
rising
most
of
my
boats
have
gone
into
winter
quarters
your
honor
the
mayflower
went
into
dry
dock
last
week
to
be
calked
up
the
pinta
and
the
santa
maria
are
slow
and
cranky
the
monitor
and
the
merrimac
i
really
had
time
to
patch
up
and
the
valkyrie
is
two
months
overdue
i
can
not
make
up
my
mind
whether
she
is
lost
or
kept
back
by
excursion
steamers
hence
i
really
do
know
what
i
can
lend
you
any
of
these
boat
i
have
named
you
could
have
had
for
nothing
but
my
others
are
actively
employed
and
i
could
let
them
go
without
a
serious
interference
with
my
business
the
old
man
blinked
sorrowfully
across
the
waters
at
the
opposite
shore
it
was
quite
evident
that
he
realized
what
a
dreadful
expense
the
club
was
about
to
be
put
to
and
while
of
course
there
would
be
profit
in
it
for
him
he
was
sincerely
sorry
for
them
i
repeat
he
added
those
boats
you
could
have
had
for
nothing
but
the
others
i
have
to
charge
you
for
though
of
course
i
give
you
a
discount
and
he
blinked
again
as
he
meditated
upon
whether
that
discount
should
be
an
eighth
or
of
one
per
cent
the
flying
dutchman
he
pursued
ai
no
good
for
your
purposes
she
too
fast
she
built
to
fly
by
not
to
stop
you
catch
up
with
the
in
a
minute
with
her
but
you
go
right
on
and
disappear
like
a
visionary
and
as
for
the
ark
she
never
do
with
all
respect
to
noah
she
just
about
as
suitable
as
any
other
waterlogged
be
and
no
more
for
elephants
and
kangaroos
but
no
good
for
and
so
slow
she
would
make
a
ripple
high
enough
to
drown
a
gnat
going
at
the
top
of
her
speed
furthermore
she
got
a
great
big
hole
in
her
bottom
where
she
was
stove
in
by
running
afoul
of
mount
i
believe
it
was
called
when
captain
noah
went
cruising
with
that
menagerie
of
his
that
an
unmitigated
falsehood
cried
noah
angrily
this
man
talks
like
a
professional
amateur
yachtsman
he
has
no
regard
for
facts
but
simply
goes
ahead
and
makes
statements
with
an
utter
disregard
of
the
truth
the
ark
was
not
stove
in
we
beached
her
very
successfully
i
say
this
in
defence
of
my
seamanship
which
was
for
my
day
could
sail
six
weeks
without
fouling
a
sneered
wren
perceiving
a
chance
to
get
even
the
hole
there
just
the
same
said
charon
maybe
she
was
a
centreboard
sad
that
where
you
kept
the
board
the
hole
is
there
because
it
was
worn
there
by
one
of
the
elephants
retorted
noah
you
get
a
beast
like
the
elephant
shuffling
one
of
his
up
and
down
up
and
down
a
plank
for
hours
a
day
for
forty
days
in
one
of
your
boats
and
see
where
your
boat
would
be
thanks
said
charon
calmly
but
the
elephants
do
patronize
my
line
all
the
elephants
i
ever
seen
in
hades
waded
over
except
jumbo
and
he
reached
his
trunk
across
fastened
on
to
a
tree
limb
with
it
and
swung
himself
over
however
the
ark
is
at
all
what
you
want
unless
you
are
going
to
man
her
with
a
lot
of
centaurs
if
that
your
intention
i
charter
her
the
accommodations
are
just
the
thing
for
a
crew
of
that
kind
well
what
do
you
suggest
asked
raleigh
somewhat
impatiently
you
told
us
what
we
ca
do
now
tell
us
what
we
can
do
i
stay
right
here
said
charon
and
let
the
ladies
rescue
themselves
that
what
i
do
i
had
the
honor
of
bringing
over
here
and
i
think
i
know
pretty
well
i
watched
close
and
it
my
private
opinion
that
before
many
days
you
see
your
sailing
back
here
with
queen
elizabeth
at
the
hellum
and
the
other
ladies
on
the
deck
knittin
and
crochetin
and
tearin
each
other
to
pieces
in
a
conversational
way
as
happy
as
if
there
never
had
been
any
captain
kidd
and
his
pirate
crew
that
suggestion
is
impossible
said
blackstone
rising
whether
the
relief
expedition
amounts
to
anything
or
not
it
good
to
be
set
going
the
ladies
would
never
forgive
us
if
we
sat
here
inactive
even
if
they
were
capable
of
rescuing
themselves
it
is
an
accepted
principle
of
law
that
this
climate
hath
no
fury
like
a
woman
left
to
herself
and
we
got
enough
professional
furies
hereabouts
without
our
aiding
in
augmenting
the
ranks
we
must
have
a
boat
it
cost
you
a
thousand
dollars
a
week
said
charon
i
subscribe
fifty
cried
hamlet
i
consult
my
secretary
said
solomon
and
find
out
how
many
of
my
wives
have
been
abducted
and
i
pay
ten
dollars
apiece
for
their
recovery
that
liberal
said
hawkshaw
there
are
of
on
board
together
with
eighty
of
his
fiancees
what
the
quotation
on
fiancees
king
solomon
nothing
said
solomon
they
not
mine
yet
and
it
their
father
business
to
get
back
not
mine
other
subscriptions
came
pouring
in
and
it
was
not
long
before
everybody
save
shylock
had
put
his
name
down
for
something
this
some
one
of
the
more
of
the
spirits
soon
observed
and
with
reckless
disregard
of
the
feelings
of
the
merchant
of
venice
began
to
call
shylock
shylock
how
much
the
merchant
tried
to
leave
the
pier
but
his
path
was
blocked
subscribe
subscribe
was
the
cry
how
much
order
gentlemen
order
said
sir
walter
rising
and
holding
a
bottle
aloft
a
black
person
by
the
name
of
friday
a
valet
of
our
friend
crusoe
has
just
handed
me
this
bottle
which
he
picked
up
ten
minutes
ago
on
the
bank
of
the
river
a
few
miles
distant
it
contains
a
bit
of
paper
and
may
perhaps
give
us
a
clew
based
upon
something
more
substantial
than
even
the
wonderful
theories
of
our
new
brother
holmes
a
deathly
silence
followed
the
chairman
words
as
sir
walter
drew
a
corkscrew
from
his
pocket
and
opened
the
bottle
he
extracted
the
paper
and
as
he
had
surmised
it
proved
to
be
a
message
from
the
missing
vessel
his
face
brightening
with
a
smile
of
relief
sir
walter
read
aloud
have
just
emerged
into
the
atlantic
club
in
hands
of
kidd
and
forty
ruffians
one
hundred
and
ladies
on
board
headed
for
the
azores
send
aid
at
once
all
well
except
xanthippe
who
is
seasick
in
the
signed
portia
aha
cried
hawkshaw
that
shows
how
valuable
the
holmes
theory
is
precisely
said
holmes
no
woman
knows
anything
about
seafaring
but
portia
is
right
the
ship
is
headed
for
the
azores
which
is
the
first
tack
needed
in
a
windward
sail
for
london
under
the
present
conditions
the
reply
was
greeted
with
cheers
and
when
they
subsided
the
cry
for
shylock
subscription
began
again
but
he
declined
i
had
intended
to
put
up
a
thousand
ducats
he
said
defiantly
but
with
that
woman
portia
on
board
i
wo
give
a
red
obolus
and
with
that
he
wrapped
his
cloak
about
him
and
stalked
off
into
the
gathering
shadows
of
the
wood
and
so
the
funds
were
raised
without
the
aid
of
shylock
and
the
shapely
steamer
the
gehenna
was
chartered
of
charon
and
put
under
the
command
of
sherlock
holmes
who
after
he
had
thanked
the
company
for
their
confidence
walked
abstractedly
away
observing
in
strictest
confidence
to
himself
that
he
had
done
well
to
prepare
that
bottle
beforehand
and
bribe
crusoe
man
to
find
it
for
now
he
said
with
a
chuckle
i
can
get
back
to
earth
again
free
of
cost
on
my
own
hook
whether
my
eminent
inventor
wants
me
there
or
not
i
never
approved
of
his
killing
me
off
as
he
did
at
the
very
height
of
my
popularity
chapter
iv
on
board
the
meanwhile
the
ladies
were
not
having
such
a
bad
time
after
all
once
having
gained
possession
of
the
they
were
loath
to
think
of
ever
having
to
give
it
up
again
and
it
is
an
open
question
in
my
mind
if
they
would
not
have
made
off
with
it
themselves
had
captain
kidd
and
his
men
not
done
it
for
them
i
never
forgive
these
men
for
their
selfishness
in
monopolizing
all
this
said
elizabeth
with
a
vicious
stroke
of
a
which
missed
the
and
tore
a
right
angle
in
the
cloth
it
is
not
right
no
said
portia
it
is
all
wrong
and
when
we
get
back
home
going
to
give
my
beloved
bassanio
a
piece
of
my
mind
and
if
he
does
give
in
to
me
i
reverse
my
decision
in
the
famous
case
of
shylock
versus
antonio
then
i
sincerely
hope
he
does
give
in
retorted
cleopatra
for
i
swear
by
all
my
auburn
locks
that
that
was
the
very
worst
bit
of
injustice
ever
perpetrated
shakespeare
confided
to
me
one
night
at
one
of
caesar
that
he
regarded
that
as
the
biggest
joke
he
ever
wrote
and
judge
blackstone
observed
to
antony
that
the
decision
would
have
held
in
any
court
of
equity
outside
of
venice
if
you
owe
a
man
a
thousand
ducats
and
it
costs
you
three
thousand
to
get
them
that
your
affair
not
his
if
it
cost
antonio
every
drop
of
his
bluest
blood
to
pay
the
pound
of
flesh
it
was
antonio
affair
not
shylock
however
the
world
applauds
you
as
a
great
jurist
when
you
have
nothing
more
than
a
woman
keen
instinct
for
sentimental
technicalities
it
would
have
made
a
horrid
play
though
if
it
had
gone
on
shuddered
elizabeth
that
may
be
but
carried
out
realistically
it
would
have
done
away
with
a
raft
of
bad
actors
said
cleopatra
i
half
sorry
it
did
go
on
and
i
sure
it
would
have
been
any
worse
than
compelling
brutus
to
fall
on
his
sword
until
he
resembles
a
chicken
liver
en
brochette
as
is
done
in
that
julius
caesar
play
well
i
very
glad
i
did
it
snapped
portia
i
should
think
you
would
be
said
cleopatra
if
you
had
done
it
you
never
have
been
known
what
was
that
the
boat
had
given
a
slight
lurch
did
you
hear
a
shuffling
noise
up
on
deck
portia
asked
the
egyptian
queen
i
thought
i
did
and
it
seemed
as
if
the
vessel
had
moved
a
bit
returned
portia
nervously
for
like
most
women
in
an
advanced
state
of
development
she
had
become
a
martyr
to
her
nerves
it
was
merely
the
wash
from
one
of
charon
new
i
fancy
said
elizabeth
calmly
it
disgusting
the
way
that
old
fellow
allows
these
modern
innovations
to
be
brought
in
here
as
if
the
old
he
used
to
carry
shades
in
were
good
enough
for
the
immigrants
of
this
age
really
this
styx
river
is
losing
a
great
deal
of
its
charm
sir
walter
and
i
were
upset
while
out
rowing
one
day
last
summer
by
the
waves
kicked
up
by
one
of
excursion
steamers
going
up
the
river
with
a
party
of
picnickers
from
the
city
the
greater
gehenna
chowder
club
i
believe
it
was
on
board
of
her
one
might
just
as
well
live
in
the
midst
of
the
turmoil
of
a
great
city
as
try
to
get
uninterrupted
quiet
here
in
the
suburbs
in
these
days
charon
is
content
to
get
rich
slowly
he
must
make
money
by
the
barrelful
if
he
has
to
sacrifice
all
the
comfort
of
everybody
living
on
this
river
anybody
think
he
was
an
american
the
way
he
goes
on
and
everybody
else
here
is
the
same
way
the
erebeans
are
getting
to
be
a
race
of
shopkeepers
i
think
myself
sighed
cleopatra
that
hades
is
being
spoiled
by
the
introduction
of
american
ideas
it
is
getting
by
far
too
democratic
for
my
tastes
and
if
it
is
stopped
it
my
belief
that
the
best
people
will
stop
coming
here
take
madame
salon
as
it
is
now
and
compare
it
with
what
it
used
to
be
in
the
early
days
after
her
arrival
here
everybody
went
because
it
was
the
swell
thing
and
you
be
sure
of
meeting
the
intellectually
elect
on
the
one
hand
you
find
sophocles
on
the
other
cicero
across
the
room
would
be
horace
chatting
gayly
with
some
such
person
as
myself
great
warriors
from
alexander
to
bonaparte
were
there
and
glad
of
the
opportunity
to
be
there
too
statesmen
like
macchiavelli
artists
like
cellini
or
tintoretto
you
could
move
without
stepping
on
the
toes
of
genius
but
now
all
is
different
the
instinct
has
been
aroused
within
them
all
with
the
result
that
when
i
invited
mozart
to
meet
a
few
friends
at
dinner
at
my
place
last
autumn
he
sent
me
a
card
stating
his
terms
for
dinners
let
me
see
i
think
i
have
it
with
me
i
kept
it
by
me
for
fear
of
losing
it
it
is
such
a
complete
revelation
of
the
actual
condition
of
affairs
in
this
locality
ah
this
is
it
she
added
taking
a
small
bit
of
pasteboard
from
her
read
that
the
card
was
passed
about
and
all
the
ladies
were
much
astonished
and
naturally
so
for
it
ran
this
wise
notice
to
hostesses
owing
to
the
very
great
constantly
growing
and
at
times
vexatious
demands
upon
his
time
socially
herr
wolfgang
amadeus
mozart
takes
this
method
of
announcing
to
his
friends
that
on
and
after
january
his
terms
for
functions
will
be
as
follows
dinners
with
conversation
on
the
marks
theory
of
music
dinners
with
conversation
on
the
theory
of
music
illustrated
dinners
without
any
conversation
receptions
public
with
music
private
encores
single
three
encores
for
autographs
positively
no
invitations
for
teas
or
morning
musicales
considered
well
i
declare
tittered
elizabeth
as
she
read
is
that
extraordinary
he
got
the
craze
too
it
perfectly
ridiculous
said
cleopatra
but
it
fairer
than
artemus
ward
plan
mozart
gives
notice
of
his
intentions
to
charge
you
but
with
ward
it
different
he
comes
and
afterwards
sends
a
bill
for
his
fun
why
only
last
week
i
got
a
from
him
showing
a
charge
against
me
of
dollars
for
humorous
remarks
made
to
my
guests
at
a
little
party
i
gave
in
honor
of
balzac
and
worst
of
all
he
had
marked
it
remit
even
antony
when
he
wrote
a
sonnet
to
my
eyebrow
let
me
have
it
until
he
had
heard
whether
or
not
boswell
wanted
it
for
publication
in
the
gossip
with
rubens
giving
for
pay
phidias
doing
masterpieces
in
putty
for
suburban
lyceums
and
all
the
illustrious
in
other
lines
turning
their
genius
to
account
through
the
entertainment
bureaus
it
impossible
to
have
a
salon
now
you
are
indeed
right
said
madame
recamier
sadly
those
were
palmy
days
when
genius
was
satisfied
with
chicken
salad
and
lemonade
i
shall
never
forget
those
nights
when
the
wit
and
wisdom
of
all
time
were
ah
were
on
tap
at
my
house
if
i
may
so
speak
at
a
cost
to
me
of
lights
and
supper
now
the
only
people
who
will
come
for
nothing
are
those
we
used
to
think
of
paying
to
stay
away
boswell
is
always
ready
but
you
ca
run
a
salon
on
boswell
well
said
portia
i
sincerely
hope
that
you
wo
give
up
the
functions
altogether
because
i
have
always
found
them
most
delightful
it
is
still
possible
to
have
lights
and
supper
i
have
a
plan
for
next
winter
said
madame
recamier
but
i
suppose
i
shall
be
accused
of
going
into
the
commercial
side
of
it
if
i
adopt
it
the
plan
is
briefly
to
incorporate
my
salon
that
an
idea
worthy
of
an
american
i
admit
but
if
i
do
do
it
i
have
to
give
it
up
entirely
which
as
you
intimate
would
be
too
bad
an
incorporated
salon
however
would
be
a
grand
thing
if
only
because
it
would
perpetuate
the
salon
recamier
salon
limited
would
be
a
most
excellent
title
and
suitably
capitalized
would
enable
us
to
pay
our
lions
sufficiently
private
enterprise
is
powerless
under
modern
conditions
it
as
much
as
i
can
afford
to
pay
for
a
dinner
without
running
up
an
expensive
account
for
guests
and
unless
we
get
up
a
as
it
were
the
whole
affair
must
go
to
the
wall
how
would
you
make
it
pay
asked
portia
i
ca
see
where
your
dividends
would
come
from
that
is
simple
enough
said
madame
recamier
we
could
put
up
a
large
with
a
portion
of
our
capital
and
advertise
a
series
of
nights
say
one
a
week
throughout
the
season
these
would
be
warriors
night
night
poets
night
night
under
the
charge
of
and
so
on
it
would
be
understood
that
on
these
particular
evenings
the
most
interesting
people
in
certain
lines
would
be
present
and
would
mix
with
outsiders
who
should
be
admitted
only
on
payment
of
a
certain
sum
of
money
the
commonplace
inhabitants
of
this
country
could
thus
meet
the
truly
great
and
if
i
know
them
well
as
i
think
i
do
pay
readily
for
the
privilege
the
obscure
love
to
rub
up
against
the
famous
here
as
well
as
they
do
on
earth
you
run
a
sort
of
social
zoo
suggested
elizabeth
precisely
and
provide
entertainment
for
private
residences
too
an
advertisement
in
boswell
paper
which
everybody
buys
and
which
nobody
reads
said
portia
they
read
the
advertisements
retorted
madame
recamier
as
i
was
saying
an
advertisement
could
be
placed
in
boswell
paper
as
follows
you
giving
a
function
do
you
want
talent
get
your
genius
at
the
recamier
salon
limited
it
would
be
simply
magnificent
as
a
business
enterprise
the
common
herd
would
be
tickled
to
death
if
they
could
get
great
people
at
their
homes
even
if
they
had
to
pay
roundly
for
them
it
would
look
well
in
the
society
notes
would
it
if
john
boggs
gave
a
reception
and
at
the
close
of
the
account
it
said
supper
was
furnished
by
calizetti
and
the
genius
by
the
recamier
salon
limited
suggested
elizabeth
scornfully
i
must
admit
replied
the
french
lady
that
you
call
up
an
unpleasant
possibility
but
i
do
really
see
what
else
we
can
do
if
we
want
to
preserve
the
salon
idea
somebody
has
told
these
talented
people
that
they
have
a
commercial
value
and
they
are
availing
themselves
of
the
demand
it
is
a
sad
age
sighed
elizabeth
well
all
i
got
to
say
is
just
this
put
in
xanthippe
you
people
who
get
up
functions
have
brought
this
condition
of
affairs
on
yourselves
you
were
not
satisfied
to
go
ahead
and
indulge
your
passion
for
lions
in
a
moderate
fashion
take
the
case
of
demosthenes
last
winter
for
instance
his
wife
told
me
that
he
dined
at
home
three
times
during
the
winter
the
rest
of
the
time
he
was
out
here
there
and
everywhere
making
speeches
the
saving
on
his
dinner
bills
did
pay
his
pebble
account
much
less
remunerate
him
for
his
time
and
the
fearful
expense
of
nervous
energy
to
which
he
was
subjected
it
was
as
much
as
she
could
do
she
said
to
keep
him
from
shaving
one
side
of
his
head
so
that
he
could
go
out
the
way
he
used
to
do
in
athens
when
he
was
afraid
he
would
be
invited
out
and
could
scare
up
a
decent
excuse
for
refusing
did
he
do
that
cried
elizabeth
with
a
roar
of
laughter
so
the
cyclopaedias
say
it
a
good
plan
too
said
xanthippe
though
socrates
never
had
to
do
it
when
i
got
the
notion
socrates
was
going
out
too
much
i
used
to
hide
his
dress
clothes
then
there
was
the
case
of
rubens
he
gave
a
carbon
talk
at
the
thursday
night
club
merely
to
oblige
madame
sforza
and
three
weeks
later
discovered
that
she
had
sold
his
pictures
to
pay
for
her
gown
you
people
simply
run
it
into
the
ground
you
kill
the
goose
that
when
taken
at
the
flood
leads
on
to
fortune
it
advertises
you
does
the
lion
no
good
and
he
is
expected
to
be
satisfied
with
confectionery
material
and
theoretical
if
they
are
getting
tired
of
candy
and
compliments
it
because
you
have
forced
too
much
of
it
upon
them
they
like
it
just
the
same
retorted
recamier
a
genius
likes
nothing
better
than
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
when
he
feels
that
it
is
falling
on
aristocratic
ears
the
social
laurel
rests
pleasantly
on
many
a
noble
brow
true
said
xanthippe
but
when
a
man
gets
a
pile
of
christmas
wreaths
a
mile
high
on
his
head
he
begins
to
wonder
what
they
will
bring
on
the
market
an
occasional
wreath
is
very
nice
but
by
the
ton
they
are
apt
to
weigh
on
his
mind
up
to
a
certain
point
notoriety
is
like
a
woman
and
a
man
is
apt
to
love
it
but
when
it
becomes
exacting
demanding
instead
of
permitting
itself
to
be
courted
it
loses
its
charm
that
is
socratic
in
its
wisdom
smiled
portia
but
xanthippic
in
its
origin
returned
xanthippe
no
man
ever
gave
me
my
ideas
as
xanthippe
spoke
lucretia
borgia
burst
into
the
room
hurry
and
save
yourselves
she
cried
the
boat
has
broken
loose
from
her
moorings
and
is
floating
down
the
stream
if
we
hurry
up
and
do
something
we
drift
out
to
sea
what
cried
cleopatra
dropping
her
cue
in
terror
and
rushing
for
the
stairs
i
was
certain
i
felt
a
slight
motion
you
said
it
was
the
wash
from
one
of
charon
barges
elizabeth
i
thought
it
was
said
elizabeth
following
closely
after
well
it
was
moaned
lucretia
borgia
calpurnia
just
looked
out
of
the
window
and
discovered
that
we
were
in
the
ladies
crowded
anxiously
about
the
stair
and
attempted
to
ascend
cleopatra
in
the
van
but
as
the
egyptian
queen
reached
the
doorway
to
the
upper
deck
the
door
opened
and
the
hard
features
of
captain
kidd
were
thrust
roughly
through
and
his
strident
voice
rang
out
through
the
gathering
gloom
pipe
my
eye
for
a
sardine
if
we
have
captured
a
female
seminary
he
cried
and
one
by
one
the
ladies
in
terror
shrank
back
into
the
room
while
kidd
overcome
by
surprise
slammed
the
door
to
and
retreated
into
the
darkness
of
the
forward
deck
to
consult
with
his
followers
as
to
what
next
chapter
v
a
conference
on
deck
here
a
kettle
of
fish
said
kidd
pulling
his
chin
whisker
in
perplexity
as
he
and
his
gathered
about
the
captain
to
discuss
the
situation
i
blessed
if
in
all
my
experience
i
ever
sailed
athwart
anything
like
it
afore
pirating
with
a
lot
of
down
ruffians
like
you
gentlemen
is
bad
enough
but
on
a
craft
loaded
to
the
water
edge
with
advanced
women
i
half
a
mind
to
turn
back
if
you
do
you
swim
we
not
turn
back
with
you
retorted
abeuchapeta
whom
in
honor
of
his
prowess
kidd
had
appointed
executive
officer
of
the
i
have
no
desire
to
be
mutinous
captain
kidd
but
i
have
not
embarked
upon
this
enterprise
for
a
pleasure
sail
down
the
styx
i
am
out
for
business
if
you
had
thirty
thousand
women
on
board
still
should
i
not
turn
back
but
what
shall
we
do
with
pleaded
kidd
where
can
we
go
without
attracting
attention
who
going
to
feed
who
going
to
dress
who
going
to
keep
in
bonnets
you
do
know
anything
about
these
creatures
my
dear
abeuchapeta
and
ca
we
arbitrate
that
name
of
yours
it
would
be
fearful
to
remember
in
the
excitement
of
a
fight
call
him
ab
suggested
sir
henry
morgan
with
an
sneer
for
he
was
deeply
jealous
of
abeuchapeta
preferral
if
you
do
i
call
you
morgue
and
change
your
appearance
to
fit
retorted
abeuchapeta
angrily
by
the
beards
of
all
my
sainted
buccaneers
began
morgan
springing
angrily
to
his
feet
i
have
your
life
gentlemen
gentlemen
my
noble
ruffians
expostulated
kidd
come
come
this
will
never
do
i
must
have
no
quarrelling
among
my
aides
this
is
no
time
for
divisions
in
our
councils
an
entirely
unexpected
element
has
entered
into
our
affairs
and
it
behooveth
us
to
act
in
concert
it
is
no
light
matter
excuse
me
captain
said
abeuchapeta
but
that
is
where
you
and
i
do
not
agree
we
got
our
ship
and
we
got
our
crew
and
in
addition
we
find
that
the
fates
have
thrown
in
a
hundred
or
more
women
to
act
as
ballast
now
i
for
one
do
not
fear
a
woman
we
can
set
them
to
work
there
is
plenty
for
them
to
do
keeping
things
tidy
and
if
we
get
into
a
very
hard
fight
and
come
out
of
the
melee
somewhat
the
worse
for
wear
it
will
be
a
blessing
to
have
along
to
mend
our
togas
sew
buttons
on
our
uniforms
and
darn
our
hosiery
morgan
laughed
sarcastically
when
did
you
flourish
if
ever
colonel
he
asked
do
you
refer
to
me
queried
abeuchapeta
with
a
frown
you
have
guessed
correctly
replied
morgan
icily
i
have
quite
forgotten
your
date
were
you
a
success
in
the
year
one
or
when
admiral
abeuchapeta
sir
henry
interposed
kidd
fearing
a
further
outbreak
of
hostilities
admiral
abeuchapeta
was
the
terror
of
the
seas
in
the
seventh
century
and
what
he
undertook
to
do
he
did
and
his
piratical
enterprises
were
carried
on
on
a
scale
of
magnificence
which
is
without
parallel
off
the
stage
he
never
went
forth
without
at
least
seventy
galleys
and
a
hundred
other
vessels
abeuchapeta
drew
himself
up
proudly
was
my
great
year
he
said
that
what
i
thought
said
morgan
that
is
to
say
you
got
your
ideas
of
women
twelve
hundred
years
ago
and
the
ladies
have
changed
somewhat
since
that
time
i
have
great
respect
for
you
sir
as
a
ruffian
i
have
no
doubt
that
as
a
ruffian
you
are
a
complete
success
but
when
it
comes
to
you
are
sailing
in
unknown
waters
the
study
of
women
my
dear
abeuchadnezzar
peta
retorted
abeuchapeta
irritably
i
stand
corrected
the
study
of
women
my
dear
peter
said
morgan
with
a
wink
at
conrad
which
fortunately
the
pirate
did
not
see
else
there
would
have
been
an
open
break
the
study
of
women
is
more
difficult
than
that
of
astronomy
there
may
be
two
stars
alike
but
all
women
are
unique
because
she
was
this
that
or
the
other
thing
in
your
day
does
not
prove
that
she
is
any
one
of
those
things
in
our
day
in
fact
it
proves
the
contrary
why
i
venture
even
to
say
that
no
individual
woman
is
alike
that
rather
a
hazy
thought
said
kidd
scratching
his
head
in
a
puzzled
sort
of
way
i
mean
that
she
different
from
herself
at
different
times
said
morgan
what
is
it
the
poet
called
her
infinite
variety
show
or
something
of
that
sort
a
perpetual
vaudeville
a
continuous
performance
as
it
were
from
twelve
to
twelve
morgan
is
right
admiral
put
in
conrad
the
corsair
acting
temporarily
as
the
times
are
sadly
changed
and
woman
is
no
longer
what
she
was
she
is
hardly
what
she
is
much
less
what
she
was
the
roman
gynaeceum
would
be
an
impossibility
you
might
as
well
expect
delilah
to
open
a
on
board
this
boat
as
ask
any
of
these
advanced
females
to
sew
buttons
on
a
pirate
uniform
after
a
fray
or
to
keep
the
fringe
on
his
epaulets
curled
they
no
longer
they
are
keeley
motors
for
mystery
and
perpetual
motion
women
have
views
now
they
are
no
longer
content
to
be
looked
at
merely
they
must
see
for
themselves
and
the
more
they
see
the
more
they
wish
to
domesticate
man
and
emancipate
woman
it
my
private
opinion
that
if
we
are
to
get
along
with
them
at
all
the
best
thing
to
do
is
to
let
alone
i
have
always
found
i
was
better
off
in
the
abstract
and
if
this
question
is
going
to
be
settled
in
a
purely
democratic
fashion
by
submitting
it
to
a
vote
i
vote
for
any
measure
which
involves
leaving
them
strictly
to
themselves
they
nothing
but
a
lot
of
ghosts
anyhow
like
ourselves
and
we
can
pretend
we
do
see
them
if
that
could
be
it
would
be
excellent
said
morgan
but
it
is
impossible
for
a
pirate
of
the
byronic
order
my
dear
conrad
you
are
strangely
unversed
in
the
ways
of
the
sex
which
cheers
but
not
inebriates
we
can
no
more
ignore
their
presence
upon
this
boat
than
we
can
expect
whales
to
spout
kerosene
in
the
first
place
it
would
be
excessively
impolite
of
us
to
cut
them
to
decline
to
speak
to
them
if
they
should
address
us
we
may
be
pirates
ruffians
cutthroats
but
i
hope
we
shall
never
forget
that
we
are
gentlemen
the
whole
situation
is
rather
contrary
to
etiquette
do
you
think
suggested
conrad
there
nobody
to
introduce
us
and
i
ca
really
see
how
we
can
do
otherwise
than
ignore
them
i
certainly
am
not
going
to
stand
on
deck
and
make
eyes
at
them
to
try
and
pick
up
an
acquaintance
with
them
even
if
i
am
of
a
byronic
strain
you
forget
said
kidd
two
essential
features
of
the
situation
these
women
are
at
present
or
shortly
will
be
when
they
realize
their
situation
in
distress
and
a
true
gentleman
may
always
fly
to
the
rescue
of
a
distressed
female
and
the
second
point
we
shall
soon
be
on
the
seas
and
i
understand
that
on
the
fashionable
transatlantic
lines
it
is
now
considered
de
rigueur
to
speak
to
anybody
you
choose
to
the
introduction
business
is
going
to
stand
in
my
way
well
may
i
ask
put
in
abeuchapeta
just
what
it
is
that
is
worrying
you
you
said
something
about
feeding
them
and
dressing
them
and
keeping
them
in
bonnets
i
fancy
there
fish
enough
in
the
sea
to
feed
and
as
for
their
gowns
and
hats
they
can
make
themselves
every
woman
is
a
milliner
at
heart
exactly
and
we
have
to
pay
the
milliners
that
is
what
bothers
me
i
was
going
to
lead
this
expedition
to
london
paris
and
new
york
admiral
that
is
where
the
money
is
and
to
get
it
you
got
to
go
ashore
to
headquarters
you
can
not
nowadays
find
it
on
the
high
seas
modern
civilization
said
kidd
has
ruined
the
business
the
latest
news
from
the
other
world
has
really
opened
my
eyes
to
certain
facts
that
i
never
dreamed
of
the
conditions
of
the
day
of
which
i
speak
are
interestingly
shown
in
the
experience
of
our
friend
hawkins
here
captain
hawkins
would
you
have
any
objection
to
stating
to
these
gentlemen
the
condition
of
affairs
which
led
you
to
give
up
piracy
on
the
high
seas
not
the
slightest
captain
kidd
returned
captain
hawkins
who
was
a
recent
arrival
in
hades
it
is
a
sad
little
story
and
it
gives
me
a
pain
for
to
think
on
it
but
none
the
less
i
tell
it
since
you
ask
me
when
i
were
a
mere
boy
i
had
but
one
ambition
due
to
my
readin
which
was
confined
to
stories
of
a
nater
to
become
somethin
different
from
the
little
willies
an
the
clever
tommies
what
i
read
about
therein
they
was
all
good
an
they
went
to
their
reward
too
soon
in
life
for
me
who
even
in
them
days
regarded
death
as
a
stuffy
an
unpleasant
diversion
learnin
at
an
early
period
that
virtue
was
its
only
reward
an
others
i
says
to
myself
says
i
you
wishes
to
become
a
magnet
in
this
village
be
sinful
if
so
be
as
you
are
a
good
boy
an
kind
to
your
sister
an
all
other
animals
you
end
up
as
a
prosperous
father
with
fifteen
hundred
a
year
sure
with
never
no
hope
for
no
public
preferment
beyond
bein
made
the
of
the
but
if
so
be
as
how
bad
you
may
become
famous
an
go
to
congress
an
have
your
picture
in
the
sunday
noospapers
so
i
looks
around
for
books
tellin
how
to
get
in
fifty
ways
an
after
due
reflection
i
settles
in
my
mind
that
to
be
a
pirate
just
the
thing
for
me
seein
as
how
it
both
profitable
an
healthy
over
details
let
me
tell
you
that
i
became
a
pirate
i
ran
away
to
sea
an
by
dint
of
perseverance
as
the
book
useter
say
in
my
badness
i
soon
became
the
centre
of
a
evil
lot
an
when
i
says
to
i
wants
to
be
a
pirate
chief
they
hollers
back
loud
like
we
with
you
an
they
was
for
years
i
was
the
terror
of
the
venezuelan
gulf
the
spanish
main
an
the
pacific
seas
but
there
was
precious
little
money
into
it
the
best
pay
i
got
was
from
a
sunday
noospaper
which
paid
me
well
to
sign
an
article
on
piracy
which
i
did
write
finally
business
got
so
bad
the
crew
began
to
murmur
an
i
was
at
my
wits
ends
to
please
when
one
mornin
havin
passed
a
restless
night
i
picks
up
a
noospaper
and
sees
in
it
that
saturday
steamer
is
a
weritable
ship
takin
out
twelve
million
dollars
and
the
jewels
of
a
certain
prima
donna
valued
at
five
hundred
thousand
my
chance
says
i
an
i
goes
to
sea
and
lies
in
wait
for
the
steamer
i
captures
her
easy
my
crew
bein
hungry
an
fightin
according
like
we
steals
the
box
the
jewels
an
the
bag
containin
the
millions
hustles
back
to
our
own
ship
an
makes
for
our
rondyvoo
me
with
two
bullets
in
my
leg
four
o
my
crew
killed
and
one
of
my
ship
disabled
by
a
shot
but
happy
twelve
an
a
half
millions
at
one
break
is
enough
to
make
anybody
happy
i
should
say
so
said
abeuchapeta
with
an
ecstatic
shake
of
his
head
i
did
get
that
in
all
my
career
nor
i
sighed
kidd
but
go
on
hawkins
well
as
i
says
continued
captain
hawkins
we
goes
to
the
rondyvoo
to
look
over
our
booty
says
my
valet
for
i
was
a
swell
pirate
gents
an
never
travelled
nowhere
without
a
man
to
keep
my
clothes
brushed
and
the
proper
wrinkles
in
my
trousers
twelve
millions
says
he
werry
light
says
he
carryin
the
bag
ashore
do
care
how
light
it
is
so
long
as
it
twelve
millions
henderson
says
i
but
my
heart
sinks
inside
o
me
at
his
words
an
the
minute
we
lands
i
sits
down
to
investigate
right
there
on
the
beach
i
opens
the
bag
an
it
the
one
i
was
after
but
the
twelve
millions
were
there
cried
conrad
yes
they
was
there
sighed
hawkins
but
every
bloomin
million
was
represented
by
a
certified
check
an
payable
in
london
by
jingo
cried
morgan
what
fearful
luck
but
you
had
the
prima
donna
jewels
yes
said
hawkins
with
a
moan
but
they
was
like
all
other
prima
donna
jewels
for
advertisin
purposes
only
an
made
o
arabic
horrible
said
abeuchapeta
and
the
crew
what
did
they
say
they
was
a
crew
of
a
few
words
sighed
hawkins
werry
few
words
an
not
a
civil
word
in
the
lot
mostly
adjectives
of
a
profane
kind
when
i
told
what
had
happened
they
got
mad
at
fortune
for
jiltin
of
an
well
i
came
here
i
was
that
werry
night
they
killed
you
cried
morgan
a
dozen
times
nodded
hawkins
they
always
was
a
lavish
lot
i
met
death
in
all
its
most
horrid
forms
first
they
stabbed
me
then
they
shot
me
then
they
clubbed
me
and
so
on
endin
up
with
a
lynchin
but
i
did
mind
much
after
the
first
which
hurt
a
bit
but
now
that
i
here
i
glad
it
happened
this
life
is
sort
of
less
responsible
than
that
other
you
ca
hurt
a
ghost
by
shooting
him
because
there
ai
nothing
to
hurt
an
i
must
say
i
like
a
mere
vision
what
everybody
can
see
through
all
of
which
interesting
tale
proves
what
queried
abeuchapeta
that
piracy
on
the
sea
is
not
profitable
in
these
days
of
the
check
banking
system
said
kidd
if
you
can
get
a
chance
at
real
gold
it
all
right
but
it
of
no
earthly
use
to
steal
checks
that
people
can
stop
payment
on
therefore
it
was
my
plan
to
visit
the
cities
and
do
a
little
freebooting
there
where
solid
material
wealth
is
to
be
found
well
ca
we
do
it
now
asked
abeuchapeta
not
with
these
women
tagging
after
us
returned
kidd
if
we
went
to
london
and
lifted
the
whole
bank
of
england
these
women
would
have
it
spent
on
regent
street
inside
of
hours
then
leave
them
on
board
said
abeuchapeta
and
have
them
steal
the
ship
retorted
kidd
no
there
are
but
two
things
to
do
take
back
or
land
them
in
paris
tell
them
to
spend
a
week
on
shore
while
we
are
provisioning
tell
to
shop
to
their
hearts
content
and
while
they
are
doing
it
we
can
sneak
off
and
leave
them
stranded
splendid
cried
morgan
but
will
they
consent
asked
abeuchapeta
consent
to
shop
in
paris
for
a
week
cried
morgan
ha
ha
laughed
hawkins
will
they
consent
will
a
duck
swim
and
so
it
was
decided
which
was
the
first
incident
in
the
career
of
the
upon
which
the
astute
sherlock
holmes
had
failed
to
count
chapter
vi
a
conference
when
with
a
resounding
slam
the
door
to
the
upper
deck
of
the
was
shut
in
the
faces
of
queens
elizabeth
and
cleopatra
by
the
unmannerly
kidd
these
ladies
turned
and
gazed
at
those
who
thronged
the
stairs
behind
them
in
blank
amazement
and
the
heart
of
xanthippe
had
one
chosen
to
gaze
through
that
diaphanous
ribs
could
have
been
seen
to
beat
angrily
queen
elizabeth
was
so
excited
at
this
wholly
novel
attitude
towards
her
regal
self
that
having
turned
she
sat
down
plump
upon
the
floor
in
the
most
unroyal
fashion
well
she
ejaculated
if
this
does
not
surpass
everything
the
idea
of
it
oh
for
one
hour
of
my
olden
power
one
hour
of
the
axe
one
hour
of
the
block
get
up
retorted
cleopatra
and
let
us
all
return
to
the
room
and
discuss
this
matter
calmly
it
is
quite
evident
that
something
has
happened
of
which
we
wotted
little
when
we
came
aboard
this
craft
that
is
a
good
idea
said
calpurnia
retreating
below
i
can
see
through
the
window
that
we
are
in
motion
the
vessel
has
left
her
moorings
and
is
making
considerable
headway
down
the
stream
and
the
distinctly
masculine
voices
we
have
heard
are
indications
to
my
mind
that
the
ship
is
manned
and
that
this
is
the
result
of
design
rather
than
of
accident
let
us
below
elizabeth
rose
up
and
readjusted
her
ruff
which
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
had
been
forced
to
assume
a
position
about
her
forehead
which
gave
one
the
impression
that
its
royal
wearer
had
suddenly
donned
a
sombrero
very
well
she
said
let
us
below
but
oh
for
the
axe
bring
the
lady
an
axe
cried
xanthippe
sarcastically
she
wants
to
cut
somebody
the
sally
was
not
greeted
with
applause
the
situation
was
regarded
as
being
too
serious
to
admit
of
humor
and
in
silence
they
filed
back
into
the
and
arranging
themselves
in
groups
stood
about
anxiously
discussing
the
situation
it
getting
rougher
every
minute
sobbed
ophelia
look
at
those
these
were
in
very
truth
chasing
each
other
about
the
table
in
an
extraordinary
fashion
and
i
wish
i
never
followed
you
horrid
new
creatures
on
board
the
poor
girl
added
in
an
agony
of
despair
i
believe
we
crossed
the
bar
already
said
cleopatra
gazing
out
of
the
window
at
a
nasty
choppy
sea
that
was
adding
somewhat
to
the
disquietude
of
the
fair
gathering
if
this
is
merely
a
joke
on
the
part
of
the
associated
shades
it
is
a
mighty
poor
one
and
i
think
it
is
time
it
should
cease
oh
for
an
axe
moaned
elizabeth
again
excuse
me
your
majesty
put
in
xanthippe
you
said
that
before
and
i
must
say
it
is
getting
tiresome
you
could
do
anything
with
an
axe
suppose
you
had
one
what
earthly
good
would
it
do
you
who
were
accustomed
to
doing
all
your
killing
by
proxy
i
do
believe
if
you
had
the
unmannerly
person
who
slammed
the
door
in
your
face
lying
prostrate
upon
the
here
you
could
hit
him
a
square
blow
in
the
neck
if
you
had
a
hundred
axes
delilah
might
as
well
cry
for
her
scissors
for
all
the
good
it
would
do
us
in
our
predicament
if
cleopatra
had
her
asp
with
her
it
might
be
more
to
the
purpose
one
deadly
little
snake
like
that
let
loose
on
the
upper
deck
would
doubtless
drive
these
boors
into
the
sea
and
even
then
our
condition
would
not
be
bettered
for
there
is
any
of
us
that
can
sail
a
boat
there
is
an
old
salt
among
us
too
bad
mrs
lot
is
along
giggled
marguerite
de
valois
whose
gallic
spirits
were
by
no
means
overshadowed
by
the
unhappy
predicament
in
which
she
found
herself
i
here
piped
up
mrs
lot
but
i
not
that
kind
of
a
salt
i
am
present
said
noah
though
why
i
ever
came
i
know
for
i
vowed
the
minute
i
set
my
foot
on
ararat
that
dry
land
was
good
enough
for
me
and
that
i
never
step
aboard
another
boat
as
long
as
i
lived
if
however
now
that
i
am
here
i
can
give
you
the
benefit
of
my
nautical
experience
you
are
all
perfectly
welcome
to
it
i
sure
we
very
much
obliged
for
the
offer
said
portia
but
in
the
emergency
which
has
arisen
we
can
not
say
how
much
obliged
we
are
until
we
know
what
your
experience
amounted
to
before
relying
upon
you
we
ought
to
know
how
far
that
reliance
can
go
not
that
i
lack
confidence
in
you
my
dear
madam
but
that
in
an
hour
of
peril
one
must
take
care
to
rely
upon
the
oak
not
upon
the
reed
the
point
is
properly
taken
said
elizabeth
and
i
wish
to
say
here
that
i
am
easier
in
my
mind
when
i
realize
that
we
have
with
us
so
a
person
as
the
lady
who
has
just
spoken
she
has
spoken
truly
and
to
the
point
if
i
were
to
become
queen
again
i
should
make
her
my
we
must
not
go
ahead
impulsively
but
look
at
all
things
in
a
calm
judicial
manner
which
is
pretty
hard
work
with
a
sea
like
this
on
remarked
ophelia
faintly
for
she
was
getting
a
trifle
sallow
as
indeed
she
might
for
the
was
beginning
to
roll
tremendously
with
no
alleviation
save
an
occasional
pitch
which
was
an
alleviation
only
in
the
sense
that
it
gave
variety
to
their
discomfort
i
believe
a
could
look
at
things
calmly
and
in
a
judicial
manner
if
he
felt
as
i
do
poor
dear
said
the
matronly
noah
sympathetically
i
know
exactly
how
you
feel
i
have
been
there
myself
the
fourth
day
out
i
and
my
whole
family
were
in
the
same
condition
except
that
noah
my
husband
was
so
very
far
gone
that
i
could
not
afford
to
yield
i
nursed
him
for
six
days
before
he
got
his
on
and
then
succumbed
myself
but
gasped
ophelia
that
does
help
me
it
did
my
husband
said
noah
when
he
heard
that
the
boys
were
seasick
too
he
actually
laughed
and
began
to
get
better
right
away
there
is
really
only
one
cure
for
the
mal
de
mer
and
that
is
the
fun
of
knowing
that
somebody
else
is
suffering
too
if
some
of
you
ladies
would
kindly
yield
to
the
seductions
of
the
sea
i
think
we
could
get
this
poor
girl
on
her
feet
in
an
instant
unfortunately
for
poor
ophelia
there
was
no
immediate
response
to
this
appeal
and
the
unhappy
young
woman
was
forced
to
suffer
in
solitude
we
have
no
time
for
untimely
diversions
of
this
sort
snapped
xanthippe
with
a
scornful
glance
at
the
suffering
ophelia
who
having
retired
to
a
comfortable
lounge
at
an
end
of
the
room
was
evidently
improving
i
have
no
sympathy
with
this
habit
some
of
my
sex
seem
to
have
acquired
of
succumbing
to
an
immediate
sensation
of
this
nature
i
hope
to
be
pardoned
for
interrupting
said
noah
with
a
great
deal
of
firmness
but
i
wish
socrates
to
understand
that
it
is
rather
early
in
the
voyage
for
her
to
lay
down
any
such
broad
principle
as
that
and
for
her
own
sake
i
think
it
would
be
well
if
she
withdrew
the
sentiment
there
are
certain
things
about
a
that
are
more
or
less
beyond
the
control
of
man
or
woman
and
any
one
who
chides
that
poor
suffering
child
on
yonder
sofa
ought
to
be
more
confident
than
socrates
can
possibly
be
that
within
an
hour
she
will
not
be
as
badly
off
people
who
live
in
glass
houses
should
not
throw
dice
i
shall
never
yield
to
anything
so
undignified
as
seasickness
let
me
tell
you
that
retorted
xanthippe
furthermore
the
proverb
is
not
as
the
lady
has
quoted
it
who
live
in
glass
houses
should
not
throw
stones
is
the
proper
version
i
was
not
quoting
returned
noah
calmly
when
i
said
that
people
who
live
in
glass
houses
should
not
throw
dice
i
meant
precisely
what
i
said
people
who
live
in
glass
houses
should
not
take
chances
in
assuming
with
such
vainglorious
positiveness
that
she
will
not
be
seasick
the
lady
who
has
just
spoken
is
giving
tremendous
odds
as
the
boys
used
to
say
on
the
ark
when
we
gathered
about
the
table
at
night
and
began
to
make
small
wagers
on
the
run
i
think
we
had
better
suspend
this
discussion
suggested
cleopatra
it
is
of
no
immediate
interest
to
any
one
but
ophelia
and
i
fancy
she
does
not
care
to
dwell
upon
it
at
any
great
length
it
is
more
important
that
we
should
decide
upon
our
future
course
of
action
in
the
first
place
the
question
is
who
these
people
up
on
deck
are
if
they
are
the
members
of
the
club
we
are
all
right
they
will
give
us
our
scare
and
land
us
safely
again
at
the
pier
in
that
event
it
is
our
womanly
duty
to
manifest
no
concern
and
to
seem
to
be
aware
of
nothing
unusual
in
the
proceeding
it
would
never
do
to
let
them
think
that
their
joke
has
been
a
good
one
if
on
the
other
hand
as
i
fear
we
are
the
victims
of
some
horde
of
ruffians
who
have
pounced
upon
us
unawares
and
are
going
into
the
business
of
abduction
on
a
wholesale
basis
we
must
meet
treachery
with
treachery
strategy
with
strategy
i
for
one
am
perfectly
willing
to
make
every
man
on
board
walk
the
plank
having
confidence
in
the
seawomanship
of
noah
and
her
ability
to
steer
us
into
port
i
am
quite
in
accord
with
these
views
put
in
madame
recamier
and
i
move
you
president
that
we
organize
a
series
of
committees
one
on
treachery
with
lucretia
borgia
and
delilah
as
members
one
on
strategy
consisting
of
portia
and
queen
elizabeth
one
on
navigation
headed
by
noah
with
a
final
on
reconnoitre
with
cassandra
to
look
forward
and
mrs
lot
to
look
aft
all
of
these
subordinated
to
a
central
committee
of
safety
headed
by
cleopatra
and
calpurnia
the
rest
of
us
can
then
commit
ourselves
and
our
interests
unreservedly
to
these
ladies
and
proceed
to
enjoy
ourselves
without
thought
of
the
morrow
i
second
the
motion
said
ophelia
with
the
amendment
that
madame
recamier
be
appointed
of
another
on
entertainment
the
amendment
was
accepted
and
the
motion
put
it
was
carried
with
an
enthusiastic
aye
and
the
organization
was
complete
the
various
committees
retired
to
the
several
corners
of
the
room
to
discuss
their
individual
lines
of
action
when
a
shadow
was
observed
to
obscure
the
moonlight
which
had
been
streaming
in
through
the
window
the
faces
of
calpurnia
and
cleopatra
blanched
for
an
instant
as
immediately
following
upon
this
apparition
a
large
bundle
was
hurled
through
the
open
port
into
the
middle
of
the
room
and
the
shadow
vanished
is
it
a
bomb
cried
several
of
the
ladies
at
once
nonsense
said
madame
recamier
jumping
lightly
forward
a
man
does
mind
blowing
a
woman
up
but
he
never
blow
himself
up
we
safe
enough
in
that
respect
the
thing
looks
to
me
like
a
bundle
of
illustrated
papers
that
what
it
is
said
cleopatra
who
had
been
investigating
it
rather
a
discourteous
bit
of
courtesy
tossing
them
in
through
the
window
that
way
i
think
but
i
presume
they
mean
well
dear
me
she
added
as
having
untied
the
bundle
she
held
one
of
the
open
papers
up
before
her
how
interesting
all
the
latest
paris
fashions
humph
look
at
those
sleeves
elizabeth
what
an
impregnable
fortress
you
would
have
been
with
those
sleeves
added
to
your
ruffs
i
should
think
they
be
very
becoming
put
in
cassandra
standing
on
her
and
looking
over
cleopatra
shoulder
that
watteau
is
bad
either
is
it
now
no
remarked
calpurnia
i
wonder
how
a
watteau
back
like
that
would
go
on
my
blue
alpaca
very
nicely
said
elizabeth
how
many
gores
has
it
five
observed
calpurnia
one
more
than
caesar
toga
we
had
to
have
our
costumes
distinct
in
some
way
a
remarkable
hat
that
nodded
mrs
lot
her
eye
catching
sight
of
a
virot
creation
at
the
top
of
the
page
reminds
me
of
eve
description
of
an
autumn
scene
in
the
garden
smiled
noah
gorgeous
in
its
foliage
beautiful
thing
though
i
should
have
dared
wear
one
in
the
ark
with
all
those
hungry
animals
browsing
about
the
upper
and
lower
decks
i
wonder
remarked
cleopatra
as
she
cocked
her
head
to
one
side
to
take
in
the
full
effect
of
an
attractive
summer
gown
i
wonder
how
that
waist
would
make
up
in
blue
crepon
with
a
yoke
of
lace
and
a
stylishly
contrasting
stock
of
satin
ribbon
it
would
depend
upon
how
you
finished
the
sleeves
remarked
madame
recamier
if
you
had
a
few
puffs
of
rich
brocaded
satin
set
in
with
deeply
folded
pleats
it
would
be
bad
i
think
it
would
be
very
effective
observed
noah
but
a
trifle
too
light
for
general
wear
i
should
want
some
kind
of
a
wrap
with
it
it
does
need
that
assented
elizabeth
a
wrap
made
of
passementerie
and
jet
with
a
mousseline
de
soie
ruche
about
the
neck
held
by
a
chou
would
make
it
fascinating
the
committee
on
treachery
is
ready
to
report
said
delilah
rising
from
her
corner
where
she
and
lucretia
borgia
had
been
having
so
animated
a
discussion
that
they
had
failed
to
observe
the
others
crowding
about
cleopatra
and
the
papers
a
little
sombre
said
cleopatra
the
corsage
is
effective
but
i
do
like
those
basque
terminations
i
never
approved
of
those
full
godets
the
committee
on
treachery
remarked
delilah
again
raising
her
voice
has
a
suggestion
to
make
i
ca
get
over
those
sleeves
though
laughed
helen
of
troy
what
is
the
use
of
them
they
might
be
used
to
get
greeks
into
troy
suggested
madame
recamier
the
committee
on
treachery
roared
delilah
thoroughly
angered
by
the
absorption
of
the
chairman
and
others
has
a
suggestion
to
make
this
is
the
third
and
last
call
oh
i
beg
pardon
cried
cleopatra
rapping
for
order
i
had
forgotten
all
about
our
committees
excuse
me
delilah
i
ah
was
absorbed
in
other
matters
will
you
kindly
lay
your
pattern
i
should
say
your
plan
before
us
it
is
briefly
this
said
delilah
it
has
been
suggested
that
we
invite
the
crew
of
this
vessel
to
a
party
under
the
supervision
of
lucretia
borgia
and
that
she
the
balance
of
the
plan
was
not
outlined
for
at
this
point
the
speaker
was
interrupted
by
a
loud
knocking
at
the
door
its
instant
opening
and
the
appearance
in
the
doorway
of
that
ruffian
captain
kidd
ladies
he
began
i
have
come
here
to
explain
to
you
the
situation
in
which
you
find
yourselves
have
i
your
permission
to
speak
the
ladies
started
back
but
the
chairman
was
equal
to
the
occasion
go
on
said
cleopatra
with
queenly
dignity
turning
to
the
interloper
and
the
pirate
proceeded
to
take
the
second
step
in
the
nefarious
plan
upon
which
he
and
his
brother
ruffians
had
agreed
of
which
the
tossing
in
through
the
window
of
the
bundle
of
fashion
papers
was
the
first
chapter
vii
the
gehenna
is
chartered
it
was
about
hours
after
the
events
narrated
in
the
preceding
chapters
that
sherlock
holmes
assumed
command
of
the
gehenna
which
was
nothing
more
nor
less
than
the
shadow
of
the
starred
ocean
steamship
city
of
chicago
which
tried
some
years
ago
to
reach
liverpool
by
taking
the
overland
route
through
ireland
fortunately
without
detriment
to
her
passengers
and
crew
who
had
the
pleasure
of
the
experience
of
shipwreck
without
any
of
the
discomforts
of
drowning
as
will
be
remembered
the
obstructionist
nature
of
the
irish
soil
prevented
the
city
of
chicago
from
proceeding
farther
inland
than
was
necessary
to
keep
her
well
balanced
amidships
upon
a
convenient
and
not
too
stony
bed
and
that
after
a
brief
sojourn
on
the
rocks
she
was
finally
disposed
of
to
the
styx
navigation
company
under
which
title
charon
had
had
himself
incorporated
is
a
matter
of
nautical
history
the
change
of
name
to
the
gehenna
was
the
act
of
charon
himself
and
was
prompted
no
doubt
by
a
desire
to
soften
the
jealous
prejudices
of
the
residents
of
the
stygian
capital
against
the
flourishing
and
metropolis
of
illinois
the
associated
shades
had
had
some
trouble
in
getting
this
craft
charon
through
his
constant
association
with
life
on
both
sides
of
the
dark
river
had
gained
a
knowledge
more
or
less
intimate
of
modern
business
methods
and
while
as
janitor
of
the
club
he
was
subject
to
the
will
of
the
committee
and
sympathized
deeply
with
the
members
of
the
association
in
their
trouble
as
president
of
the
styx
navigation
company
he
was
bound
up
in
certain
newly
attained
commercial
ideas
which
were
embarrassing
to
those
members
of
the
association
to
whose
hands
the
chartering
of
a
vessel
had
been
committed
see
here
charon
sir
walter
raleigh
had
said
after
charon
had
expressed
himself
as
deeply
sympathetic
but
unable
to
shave
the
terms
upon
which
the
vessel
could
be
had
you
are
an
infernal
old
hypocrite
you
go
about
wringing
your
hands
over
our
misfortunes
until
they
got
as
dry
and
flabby
as
a
pair
of
kid
gloves
and
yet
when
we
ask
you
for
a
ship
of
suitable
size
and
speed
to
go
out
after
those
pirates
you
become
a
sort
of
twin
brother
to
shylock
without
his
excuse
his
instincts
are
accidents
of
birth
yours
are
cultivated
and
you
know
it
you
are
very
much
mistaken
sir
walter
charon
had
answered
to
this
you
do
understand
my
position
it
is
a
very
hard
one
as
janitor
of
your
club
i
am
really
prostrated
over
the
events
of
the
past
hours
my
occupation
is
gone
and
my
despair
over
your
loss
is
correspondingly
greater
for
i
have
time
on
my
hands
to
brood
over
it
i
was
hysterical
as
a
woman
yesterday
afternoon
so
hysterical
that
i
came
near
upsetting
one
of
the
furies
who
engaged
me
to
row
her
down
to
madame
medusa
villa
last
evening
and
right
at
the
sluice
of
the
vitriol
reservoir
at
that
then
why
the
deuce
do
you
do
something
to
help
us
pleaded
hamlet
how
can
i
do
any
more
than
i
have
done
i
offered
you
the
gehenna
retorted
charon
but
on
what
terms
expostulated
raleigh
if
we
had
all
the
wealth
of
the
indies
we
have
difficulty
in
paying
you
the
sums
you
demand
but
i
am
only
president
of
the
company
explained
charon
like
as
president
to
show
you
some
courtesy
and
i
perfectly
willing
to
do
so
but
when
it
comes
down
to
giving
you
a
vessel
like
that
i
bound
by
my
official
oath
to
consider
the
interest
of
the
stockholders
it
is
as
it
used
to
be
when
i
had
boats
to
hire
in
my
own
behalf
alone
in
those
days
i
had
nobody
interest
but
my
own
to
look
after
now
the
ships
all
belong
to
the
styx
navigation
company
ca
you
see
the
difference
you
own
all
the
stock
do
you
insisted
raleigh
i
do
know
charon
answered
blandly
i
have
seen
the
lately
but
you
know
that
you
did
own
every
share
of
it
and
that
you
have
sold
any
do
you
put
in
hamlet
charon
was
puzzled
for
a
moment
but
shortly
his
face
cleared
and
sir
walter
heart
sank
for
it
was
evident
that
the
old
fellow
could
not
be
cornered
well
it
this
way
sir
walter
and
your
highness
he
said
i
i
ca
say
whether
any
of
that
stock
has
been
transferred
or
not
the
fact
is
i
been
speculating
a
little
on
margin
and
i
put
up
that
stock
as
security
and
for
all
i
know
i
may
have
been
sold
out
by
my
brokers
i
been
so
upset
by
this
unfortunate
occurrence
that
i
have
seen
the
market
reports
for
two
days
really
have
to
be
content
with
my
offer
or
go
without
the
gehenna
too
much
suspicion
attached
to
high
corporate
officials
lately
for
me
to
yield
a
jot
in
the
position
i
have
taken
it
would
never
do
to
get
you
all
ready
to
start
and
then
have
an
injunction
clapped
on
you
by
some
unforeseen
stockholder
who
was
not
satisfied
with
the
terms
offered
you
nor
can
i
ever
let
it
be
said
of
me
that
to
retain
my
position
as
janitor
of
your
organization
i
sacrificed
a
trust
committed
to
my
charge
i
gladly
lend
you
my
private
launch
though
i
do
think
it
will
aid
you
much
because
the
has
exploded
and
the
screw
slipped
off
and
went
to
the
bottom
two
weeks
ago
still
it
is
at
your
service
and
i
no
doubt
that
either
phidias
or
benvenuto
cellini
will
carve
out
a
paddle
for
you
if
you
ask
him
to
bah
retorted
raleigh
you
might
as
well
offer
us
a
pair
of
skates
i
would
if
i
thought
the
river
freeze
retorted
charon
blandly
raleigh
and
hamlet
turned
away
impatiently
and
left
charon
to
his
own
devices
which
for
the
time
being
consisted
largely
of
winking
his
other
eye
quietly
and
outwardly
making
a
great
show
of
grief
he
too
canny
for
us
i
am
afraid
said
sir
walter
we
have
to
pay
him
his
money
let
us
first
consult
sherlock
holmes
suggested
hamlet
and
this
they
proceeded
at
once
to
do
there
is
but
one
thing
to
be
done
observed
the
astute
detective
after
he
had
heard
sir
walter
statement
of
the
case
it
is
an
old
saying
that
one
should
fight
fire
with
fire
we
must
meet
modern
business
methods
with
modern
commercial
ideas
charter
his
vessel
at
his
own
price
but
we
never
be
able
to
pay
said
hamlet
laughed
holmes
it
is
evident
that
you
know
nothing
of
the
laws
of
trade
nowadays
do
pay
but
how
can
we
asked
raleigh
the
method
is
simple
you
have
anything
to
pay
with
returned
holmes
let
him
sue
suppose
he
gets
a
verdict
you
anything
he
can
attach
if
you
have
make
it
over
to
your
wives
or
your
fiancees
is
that
honest
asked
hamlet
shaking
his
head
doubtfully
it
business
said
holmes
but
suppose
he
wants
an
advance
payment
queried
hamlet
give
him
a
check
drawn
to
his
own
order
he
have
to
endorse
it
when
he
deposits
it
and
that
will
make
him
responsible
laughed
holmes
what
a
simple
thing
when
you
understand
it
commented
raleigh
very
said
holmes
business
is
getting
by
slow
degrees
to
be
an
exact
science
it
reminds
me
of
the
brighton
mystery
in
which
i
played
a
modest
part
some
ten
years
ago
when
i
first
took
up
ferreting
as
a
profession
i
was
sitting
one
night
in
my
room
at
one
of
the
brighton
hotels
which
shall
be
nameless
i
never
give
the
name
of
any
of
the
hotels
at
which
i
stop
because
it
might
give
offence
to
the
proprietors
of
other
hotels
with
the
result
that
my
books
would
be
excluded
from
sale
therein
suffice
it
to
say
that
i
was
spending
an
early
summer
sunday
at
brighton
with
my
friend
watson
we
had
dined
well
and
were
enjoying
our
evening
smoke
together
upon
a
small
balcony
overlooking
the
water
when
there
came
a
timid
knock
on
the
door
of
my
room
said
i
comes
some
one
for
advice
do
you
wish
to
wager
a
small
bottle
upon
it
he
answered
with
a
smile
am
thirsty
and
i
like
a
small
bottle
and
while
i
do
not
expect
to
win
i
take
the
bet
i
should
like
to
know
though
how
you
know
is
quite
simple
said
i
timidity
of
the
knock
shows
that
my
visitor
is
one
of
two
classes
of
persons
an
or
a
client
one
of
the
two
you
see
i
give
you
a
chance
to
win
it
may
be
an
but
i
think
it
is
a
client
if
it
were
a
creditor
he
would
knock
boldly
even
ostentatiously
if
it
were
the
maid
she
would
not
knock
at
all
if
it
were
the
he
would
not
come
until
i
had
rung
five
times
for
him
none
of
these
things
has
occurred
the
knock
is
the
knock
which
betokens
either
that
the
person
who
knocked
is
in
trouble
or
is
uncertain
as
to
his
reception
i
am
willing
however
considering
the
heat
and
my
desire
to
quench
my
thirst
to
wager
that
it
is
a
client
said
watson
and
i
immediately
remarked
in
the
door
opened
and
a
man
of
about
years
of
age
in
a
entered
the
room
and
i
saw
at
a
glance
what
had
happened
name
is
burgess
i
said
came
here
from
london
this
morning
expecting
to
return
you
brought
no
luggage
with
you
after
luncheon
you
went
bathing
you
had
machine
no
and
when
you
came
out
of
the
water
you
found
that
no
had
disappeared
with
your
clothes
and
the
silver
watch
your
uncle
gave
you
on
the
day
you
succeeded
to
his
business
of
course
gentlemen
observed
the
detective
with
a
smile
at
sir
walter
and
hamlet
of
course
the
man
fairly
gasped
and
i
continued
have
been
lying
face
downward
in
the
sand
ever
since
waiting
for
nightfall
so
that
you
could
come
to
me
for
assistance
not
considering
it
good
form
to
make
an
afternoon
call
upon
a
stranger
at
his
hotel
clad
in
a
am
i
correct
he
replied
with
a
look
of
wonder
have
narrated
my
story
exactly
as
it
happened
and
i
find
i
have
made
no
mistake
in
coming
to
you
would
you
mind
telling
me
what
is
your
course
of
reasoning
is
plain
as
day
said
i
am
the
person
with
the
red
beard
with
whom
you
came
down
third
class
from
london
this
morning
and
you
told
me
your
name
was
burgess
and
that
you
were
a
butcher
when
you
looked
to
see
the
time
i
remarked
upon
the
oddness
of
your
watch
which
led
to
your
telling
me
that
it
was
the
gift
of
your
uncle
said
burgess
i
did
not
tell
you
i
had
no
luggage
said
i
that
you
had
is
plain
for
if
you
had
brought
any
other
clothing
besides
that
you
had
on
with
you
you
would
have
put
it
on
to
come
here
that
you
have
been
robbed
i
deduce
also
from
your
costume
the
number
of
the
machine
asked
watson
on
the
tag
on
the
key
hanging
about
his
neck
said
i
more
question
queried
burgess
do
you
know
i
have
been
lying
face
downward
on
the
beach
ever
since
the
sand
in
your
eyebrows
i
replied
and
watson
ordered
up
the
small
bottle
i
fail
to
see
what
it
was
in
our
conversation
however
observed
hamlet
somewhat
impatient
over
the
delay
caused
by
the
narration
of
this
tale
that
suggested
this
train
of
thought
to
you
the
sequel
will
show
returned
holmes
oh
lord
put
in
raleigh
ca
we
put
off
the
sequel
until
a
later
issue
remember
holmes
that
we
are
constantly
losing
time
the
sequel
is
brief
and
i
can
narrate
it
on
our
way
to
the
office
of
the
navigation
company
observed
the
detective
when
the
bottle
came
i
invited
burgess
to
join
us
which
he
did
and
as
the
hour
was
late
when
we
came
to
separate
i
offered
him
the
use
of
my
parlor
overnight
this
he
accepted
and
we
retired
the
next
morning
when
i
arose
to
dress
the
mystery
was
cleared
you
had
dreamed
its
solution
asked
raleigh
no
replied
holmes
burgess
had
disappeared
with
all
my
clothing
my
my
and
my
watch
the
only
thing
he
had
left
me
was
the
and
a
few
empty
small
bottles
and
why
may
i
ask
put
in
hamlet
as
they
drew
near
to
office
why
does
that
case
remind
you
of
business
as
it
is
conducted
in
this
that
it
is
a
good
thing
to
stay
out
of
unless
you
know
it
all
explained
holmes
i
omitted
in
the
case
of
burgess
to
observe
one
thing
about
him
had
i
observed
that
his
nose
was
rectilinear
incurved
and
with
a
lifted
base
and
that
his
auricular
temporal
angle
was
between
and
degrees
i
should
have
known
at
once
that
he
was
an
impostor
vide
ottolenghui
on
and
noses
i
have
met
pp
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
can
tell
a
criminal
by
his
ears
demanded
hamlet
if
he
has
any
yes
but
i
did
not
know
that
at
the
time
of
the
brighton
mystery
therefore
i
should
have
stayed
out
of
the
case
but
here
we
are
charon
by
this
time
the
trio
had
entered
the
private
office
of
the
president
of
the
styx
navigation
company
and
in
a
few
moments
the
vessel
was
chartered
at
a
fabulous
price
on
the
return
to
the
wharf
sir
walter
somewhat
nervously
asked
holmes
if
he
thought
the
plan
they
had
settled
upon
would
work
charon
is
a
very
shrewd
old
fellow
said
he
he
may
outwit
us
yet
the
chances
are
just
two
and
degrees
in
your
favor
observed
holmes
quietly
with
a
glance
at
raleigh
ears
the
temporal
angle
of
your
ears
is
degrees
whereas
charon
stand
out
at
by
my
otometer
to
that
extent
your
criminal
instincts
are
superior
to
his
if
criminology
is
an
exact
science
reasoning
by
your
respective
ears
you
ought
to
beat
him
out
by
a
perceptible
though
possibly
narrow
margin
with
which
assurance
raleigh
went
ahead
with
his
preparations
and
within
twelve
hours
the
gehenna
was
under
way
carrying
a
full
complement
of
crew
and
officers
with
every
on
board
occupied
by
some
spirit
of
the
more
illustrious
kind
even
shylock
was
on
board
though
no
one
knew
it
for
in
the
dead
of
night
he
had
stolen
quietly
up
the
and
had
hidden
himself
in
an
empty
in
the
forecastle
is
venice
he
said
as
he
sat
down
and
breathed
heavily
through
the
bung
of
the
barrel
but
it
musty
and
damp
enough
and
considering
the
cost
i
ca
complain
you
ca
get
something
for
nothing
even
in
hades
chapter
viii
on
board
the
gehenna
when
the
gehenna
had
passed
down
the
styx
and
out
through
the
beautiful
cimmerian
harbor
into
the
broad
waters
of
the
ocean
and
everything
was
comparatively
safe
for
a
while
at
least
sherlock
holmes
came
down
from
the
bridge
where
he
had
taken
his
place
as
the
commander
of
the
expedition
at
the
moment
of
departure
his
brow
was
furrowed
with
anxiety
and
through
his
massive
forehead
his
brain
could
be
seen
to
be
throbbing
violently
and
the
corrugations
of
his
gray
matter
were
not
pleasant
to
witness
as
he
tried
vainly
to
squeeze
an
idea
out
of
them
what
is
the
matter
asked
demosthenes
anxiously
we
are
not
in
any
danger
are
we
no
replied
holmes
but
i
am
somewhat
puzzled
at
the
bubbles
on
the
surface
of
the
ocean
and
the
ripples
which
we
passed
over
an
hour
or
two
ago
barely
perceptible
through
the
most
powerful
microscope
indicate
to
my
mind
that
for
some
reason
at
present
unknown
to
me
the
has
changed
her
course
take
that
bubble
floating
by
it
is
the
last
expiring
bit
of
aerial
agitation
of
the
wake
observe
whence
it
comes
not
from
the
azores
quarter
but
as
if
instead
of
steering
a
straight
course
thither
the
had
taken
a
sharp
turn
to
the
and
was
making
for
havre
or
in
other
words
paris
instead
of
london
seems
to
have
become
their
destination
demosthenes
looked
at
holmes
with
blank
amazement
and
to
keep
from
stammering
out
the
exclamation
of
wonder
that
rose
to
his
lips
he
opened
his
bonbonniere
and
swallowed
a
pebble
you
do
happen
to
have
a
cocaine
tablet
in
your
box
do
you
queried
holmes
no
returned
the
greek
cocaine
makes
me
flighty
and
nervous
but
these
pebbles
sort
of
ballast
me
and
hold
me
down
how
on
earth
do
you
know
that
that
bubble
comes
from
the
wake
of
the
by
my
chemical
knowledge
merely
replied
holmes
a
merely
worldly
vessel
leaves
a
phosphorescent
bubble
in
its
wake
that
one
we
have
just
discovered
is
not
so
but
sulphurescent
if
i
may
coin
a
word
which
it
seems
to
me
the
english
language
is
very
much
in
need
of
it
proves
then
that
the
bubble
is
a
portion
of
the
wake
of
a
stygian
craft
and
the
only
stygian
craft
that
has
cleared
the
cimmerian
harbor
for
years
is
the
we
can
go
back
until
we
find
the
ripple
again
and
follow
that
i
presume
sneered
le
coq
who
did
not
take
much
stock
in
the
theories
of
his
great
rival
largely
because
he
was
a
detective
by
intuition
rather
than
by
study
of
the
science
you
can
if
you
want
to
but
it
is
better
not
to
rejoined
holmes
simply
as
though
not
observing
the
sneer
because
the
ripple
represents
the
outer
lines
of
the
angle
of
disturbance
in
the
water
and
as
any
one
of
the
sides
to
an
angle
is
greater
than
the
perpendicular
from
the
hypothenuse
to
the
apex
you
merely
be
going
the
long
way
this
is
especially
important
when
you
consider
the
formation
of
the
bow
of
the
which
is
rounded
like
the
stern
of
most
vessels
and
comes
near
to
making
a
pair
of
ripples
at
an
angle
of
ninety
degrees
then
observed
sir
walter
with
a
sigh
of
disappointment
we
must
change
our
course
and
sail
for
paris
i
am
afraid
so
said
holmes
but
of
course
it
by
no
means
certain
as
yet
i
think
if
columbus
would
go
up
into
the
mizzentop
and
look
about
him
he
might
discover
something
either
in
confirmation
or
refutation
of
the
theory
he
could
discover
anything
put
in
pinzon
he
never
did
well
i
like
that
retorted
columbus
i
like
to
know
who
discovered
america
so
should
i
observed
leif
ericson
with
a
wink
at
vespucci
tut
retorted
columbus
i
did
it
and
the
world
knows
it
whether
you
claim
it
or
not
yes
just
as
noah
discovered
ararat
replied
pinzon
you
sat
upon
the
deck
until
we
ran
plumb
into
an
island
after
floating
about
for
three
months
and
then
you
could
tell
it
from
a
continent
even
when
you
had
it
right
before
your
eyes
noah
might
just
as
well
have
told
his
family
that
he
discovered
a
roof
garden
as
for
you
to
go
back
to
spain
telling
all
that
san
salvador
was
the
united
states
well
i
do
care
said
columbus
with
a
short
laugh
i
the
one
they
celebrate
so
what
the
odds
i
rather
stay
down
here
in
the
enjoying
a
small
game
anyhow
than
climb
up
that
mast
and
strain
my
eyes
for
ten
or
a
dozen
hours
looking
for
evidence
to
prove
or
disprove
the
correctness
of
another
man
theory
i
would
know
evidence
when
i
saw
it
anyhow
send
judge
blackstone
i
draw
the
line
at
the
mizzentop
observed
blackstone
the
dignity
of
the
bench
must
and
shall
be
preserved
and
i
never
consent
to
climb
up
that
rigging
getting
pitch
and
paint
on
my
ermine
no
matter
who
asks
me
to
go
whomsoever
i
tell
to
go
shall
go
put
in
holmes
firmly
i
am
commander
of
this
ship
it
will
pay
you
to
remember
that
judge
blackstone
and
i
am
the
court
of
appeals
retorted
blackstone
hotly
bear
that
in
mind
captain
when
you
try
to
send
me
up
i
issue
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
on
my
own
body
and
commit
you
for
contempt
there
no
use
of
sending
the
judge
anyhow
said
raleigh
fearing
by
the
glitter
that
came
into
the
eye
of
the
commander
that
trouble
might
ensue
unless
pacificatory
measures
were
resorted
to
accustomed
to
weighing
everything
carefully
and
can
not
be
rushed
into
a
decision
if
he
saw
any
evidence
he
have
to
sit
on
it
a
week
before
reaching
a
conclusion
what
we
need
here
more
than
anything
else
is
an
expert
seaman
a
lookout
and
i
nominate
shem
he
has
sailed
under
his
father
and
i
have
it
on
good
authority
that
he
is
a
nautical
expert
holmes
hesitated
for
an
instant
he
was
considering
the
necessity
of
disciplining
the
recalcitrant
blackstone
but
he
finally
yielded
very
well
he
said
shem
be
it
pipe
shem
on
deck
and
tell
him
that
general
order
number
one
requires
him
to
report
at
the
mizzentop
right
away
and
that
immediately
he
sees
anything
he
shall
come
below
and
make
it
known
to
me
as
for
the
rest
of
us
having
a
very
considerable
appetite
i
do
now
decree
that
it
is
shall
we
go
below
i
do
think
i
care
for
any
thank
you
said
raleigh
fact
is
ah
i
dined
last
week
and
am
not
hungry
noah
laughed
oh
come
below
and
watch
us
eat
then
he
said
it
do
you
good
but
there
was
no
reply
raleigh
had
plunged
head
first
into
his
which
fortunately
happened
to
be
on
the
upper
deck
the
rest
of
the
spirits
repaired
below
to
the
saloon
where
they
were
soon
engaged
in
an
animated
discussion
of
such
viands
as
the
larder
provided
this
said
johnson
from
the
head
of
the
table
is
what
i
call
comfort
i
do
know
that
i
am
so
anxious
to
recover
the
boat
after
all
nor
i
said
socrates
with
a
ship
like
this
to
go
off
cruising
on
and
with
such
a
larder
look
at
the
thickness
of
that
puree
excuse
me
said
boswell
faintly
but
i
i
left
my
note
bub
book
upstairs
doctor
and
i
like
to
go
up
and
get
it
certainly
said
johnson
i
judge
from
your
color
which
is
highly
suggestive
of
a
modern
magazine
poster
that
it
might
be
well
too
if
you
stayed
on
deck
for
a
little
while
and
made
a
few
entries
in
your
commonplace
book
thank
you
said
boswell
gratefully
shall
you
say
anything
clever
during
dinner
sir
if
so
i
might
be
putting
it
down
while
i
up
get
out
roared
the
doctor
get
up
as
high
as
you
can
get
up
with
shem
on
the
mizzentop
very
good
sir
replied
boswell
and
he
was
off
you
ought
to
be
more
lenient
with
him
doctor
said
bonaparte
he
means
well
i
know
it
observed
johnson
but
he
so
very
previous
last
winter
at
chaucer
dinner
to
burns
i
made
a
speech
which
boswell
printed
a
week
before
it
was
delivered
with
the
words
and
applause
interspersed
through
it
it
placed
me
in
a
false
position
how
did
he
know
what
you
were
going
to
say
queried
demosthenes
do
know
replied
johnson
kind
of
i
fancy
he
added
blushing
a
trifle
but
captain
holmes
what
do
you
deduce
from
your
observation
of
the
wake
of
the
if
she
going
to
paris
why
the
change
i
have
two
theories
replied
the
detective
which
is
always
safe
said
le
coq
always
it
doubles
your
chances
of
success
acquiesced
holmes
anyhow
it
gives
you
a
choice
which
makes
it
more
interesting
the
change
of
her
course
from
londonward
to
parisward
proves
to
me
either
that
kidd
is
not
satisfied
with
the
extent
of
the
revenge
he
has
already
taken
and
wishes
to
ruin
you
gentlemen
financially
by
turning
your
wives
daughters
and
sisters
loose
on
the
parisian
shops
or
that
the
pirates
have
themselves
been
overthrown
by
the
ladies
who
have
decided
to
prolong
their
cruise
and
get
some
fun
out
of
their
misfortune
and
where
else
than
to
paris
would
any
one
in
search
of
pleasure
go
asked
bonaparte
i
had
more
fun
a
few
miles
outside
of
brussels
said
wellington
with
a
sly
wink
at
washington
oh
let
up
on
that
retorted
bonaparte
it
was
you
beat
me
at
waterloo
you
could
have
beaten
me
at
a
plain
ordinary
game
of
with
a
stacked
pack
of
cards
much
less
in
the
game
of
war
if
you
had
had
the
elements
with
you
tut
snapped
wellington
it
was
clear
science
laid
you
out
boney
shouted
the
irate
corsican
clear
science
be
hanged
wet
science
was
what
did
it
if
it
had
been
for
the
rain
my
little
duke
i
should
have
been
in
london
within
a
week
my
grenadiers
would
have
been
camping
in
your
rue
peekadeely
and
the
old
guard
all
over
everywhere
else
you
must
have
had
a
gay
army
then
laughed
caesar
what
are
french
soldiers
made
of
that
they
ca
stand
the
wet
unshrunk
linen
or
flannel
bah
observed
napoleon
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
walking
a
few
paces
away
you
do
not
understand
the
french
the
frenchman
is
not
a
soldier
like
you
romans
he
is
the
poet
of
arms
he
does
not
go
in
for
glory
at
the
expense
of
his
dignity
style
form
is
dearer
to
him
than
honor
and
he
has
no
use
for
fighting
in
the
wet
and
coming
out
of
the
fight
conspicuous
as
a
victor
with
the
curl
out
of
his
feathers
and
his
epaulets
rusted
with
the
damp
there
is
no
glory
in
water
but
if
we
had
had
umbrellas
and
mackintoshes
as
every
englishman
who
comes
to
the
continent
always
has
and
a
tub
for
everybody
then
would
your
waterloo
have
been
different
again
and
the
great
democracy
of
europe
with
a
bonaparte
for
emperor
would
have
been
founded
for
what
the
americans
call
the
keeps
and
as
for
your
little
great
britain
ha
she
would
have
become
the
blackwell
island
of
the
greater
france
you
almost
as
funny
as
punch
is
drawled
wellington
with
an
angry
gesture
at
bonaparte
you
were
within
telephoning
distance
of
victory
all
day
we
simply
played
with
you
my
boy
it
was
a
regular
game
of
golf
for
us
we
let
you
keep
up
pretty
close
and
win
a
few
holes
but
on
the
home
drive
we
had
you
beaten
in
one
stroke
go
to
my
dear
bonaparte
and
stop
talking
about
the
flood
it
a
lucky
thing
for
us
that
noah
was
a
frenchman
eh
said
frederick
the
great
how
that
rain
would
have
fazed
him
if
he
had
been
the
human
race
would
have
been
wiped
out
oh
pshaw
ejaculated
noah
deprecating
the
unseemliness
of
the
quarrel
and
putting
his
arm
affectionately
about
shoulder
when
you
come
down
to
that
i
was
french
as
french
as
one
could
be
in
those
days
and
these
gallic
subjects
of
my
friend
here
were
every
one
of
my
lineal
descendants
and
their
hatred
of
rain
was
inherited
directly
from
me
their
ancestor
are
not
we
english
as
much
your
descendants
queried
wellington
arching
his
eyebrows
you
are
said
noah
but
you
take
after
noah
more
than
after
me
water
never
fazes
a
woman
and
your
delight
in
tubs
is
an
essentially
feminine
trait
the
first
thing
noah
carried
aboard
was
a
laundry
outfit
and
then
she
went
back
for
rugs
and
coats
and
all
sorts
of
gad
it
makes
me
laugh
to
this
day
when
i
think
of
it
she
looked
for
all
the
world
like
an
englishman
travelling
on
the
continent
as
she
walked
up
the
behind
the
elephants
each
elephant
with
a
gladstone
bag
in
his
trunk
and
a
tied
to
his
tail
here
the
venerable
old
winked
at
munchausen
and
the
little
quarrel
which
had
been
imminent
passed
off
in
a
general
laugh
where
boswell
he
ought
to
get
that
anecdote
said
johnson
i
locked
him
up
in
the
library
said
holmes
he
in
charge
of
the
log
and
as
i
have
a
pretty
good
general
idea
as
to
what
is
about
to
happen
i
have
mapped
out
a
skeleton
of
the
plot
and
set
him
to
work
writing
it
up
here
the
detective
gave
a
sudden
start
placed
his
hand
to
his
ear
listened
intently
for
an
instant
and
taking
out
his
watch
and
glancing
at
it
added
quietly
in
three
minutes
shem
will
be
in
here
to
announce
a
discovery
and
one
of
great
importance
i
judge
from
the
squeak
the
assemblage
gazed
earnestly
at
holmes
for
a
moment
the
squeak
queried
raleigh
precisely
said
holmes
the
squeak
is
what
i
said
and
as
i
always
say
what
i
mean
it
follows
logically
that
i
meant
what
i
said
i
heard
no
squeak
observed
johnson
and
furthermore
i
fail
to
see
how
a
squeak
if
i
had
heard
it
would
have
portended
a
discovery
of
importance
it
would
not
to
you
said
holmes
but
with
me
it
is
different
my
hearing
is
unusually
acute
i
can
hear
the
dropping
of
a
pin
through
a
stone
wall
ten
feet
thick
any
sound
within
a
mile
of
my
eardrum
vibrates
thereon
with
an
intensity
which
would
surprise
you
and
it
is
by
the
use
of
cocaine
that
i
have
acquired
this
wonderfully
acute
sense
a
property
which
dulls
the
senses
of
most
people
renders
mine
doubly
apprehensive
therefore
gentlemen
while
to
you
there
was
no
auricular
disturbance
to
me
there
was
i
heard
shem
sliding
down
the
mast
a
minute
since
the
fact
that
he
slid
down
the
mast
instead
of
climbing
down
the
rigging
showed
that
he
was
in
great
haste
therefore
he
must
have
something
to
communicate
of
great
importance
why
is
he
here
already
then
it
would
take
him
two
minutes
to
get
from
the
deck
here
asked
the
le
coq
it
is
simple
returned
holmes
calmly
if
you
will
go
yourself
and
slide
down
that
mast
you
will
see
shem
has
stopped
for
a
little
to
soothe
his
burns
it
is
no
cool
matter
sliding
down
a
mast
two
hundred
feet
in
height
as
sherlock
holmes
spoke
the
door
burst
open
and
shem
rushed
in
a
signal
of
distress
captain
he
cried
from
what
quarter
to
larboard
asked
holmes
no
returned
shem
breathless
then
it
must
be
dead
ahead
said
holmes
why
not
to
starboard
asked
le
coq
dryly
because
answered
holmes
confidently
it
never
happens
so
if
you
had
ever
read
a
truly
exciting
my
dear
le
coq
you
would
have
known
that
interesting
things
and
particularly
signals
of
distress
are
never
seen
except
to
larboard
or
dead
ahead
a
murmur
of
applause
greeted
this
retort
and
le
coq
subsided
the
nature
of
the
signal
demanded
holmes
a
black
flag
skull
and
down
at
cried
shem
and
on
a
coast
they
marooned
by
heavens
shouted
holmes
springing
to
his
feet
and
rushing
to
the
deck
where
he
was
joined
immediately
by
sir
walter
johnson
bonaparte
and
the
others
is
he
a
daisy
whispered
demosthenes
to
diogenes
as
they
climbed
the
stairs
he
is
more
than
that
he
a
blooming
orchid
said
diogenes
with
intense
enthusiasm
i
think
i
get
my
lantern
and
see
if
he
honest
chapter
ix
captain
kidd
meets
with
an
obstacle
excuse
me
your
majesty
remarked
helen
of
troy
as
cleopatra
accorded
permission
to
captain
kidd
to
speak
i
have
not
been
introduced
to
this
gentleman
nor
has
he
been
presented
to
me
and
i
really
can
not
consent
to
any
proceeding
so
irregular
as
this
i
do
not
speak
to
gentlemen
i
have
not
met
nor
do
i
permit
them
to
address
me
hear
hear
cried
xanthippe
i
quite
agree
with
the
principle
of
my
young
friend
from
troy
it
may
be
that
when
we
claimed
for
ourselves
all
the
rights
of
men
that
the
right
to
speak
and
be
spoken
to
by
other
men
without
an
introduction
will
included
in
the
list
but
i
for
one
have
no
desire
to
avail
myself
of
the
privilege
especially
when
it
a
man
like
this
kidd
bowed
politely
and
smiled
so
terribly
that
several
of
the
ladies
fainted
i
will
withdraw
he
said
turning
to
cleopatra
and
it
must
be
said
that
his
suggestion
was
prompted
by
his
heartfelt
wish
for
now
that
he
found
himself
thus
conspicuously
brought
before
so
many
women
with
falsehood
on
his
lips
his
courage
began
to
ooze
not
yet
please
answered
the
chairlady
i
imagine
we
can
get
about
this
difficulty
without
much
trouble
i
think
it
a
perfectly
proper
objection
too
observed
delilah
rising
if
we
ever
needed
etiquette
we
need
it
now
but
i
have
a
plan
which
will
obviate
any
further
difficulty
if
there
is
no
one
among
us
who
is
sufficiently
well
acquainted
with
the
gentleman
to
present
him
formally
to
us
i
will
for
the
time
being
take
upon
myself
the
office
of
ship
barber
and
cut
his
hair
i
understand
that
it
is
quite
the
proper
thing
for
barbers
to
talk
while
cutting
their
hair
to
persons
to
whom
they
have
not
been
introduced
and
besides
he
really
needs
a
badly
thus
i
shall
establish
an
acquaintance
with
the
captain
after
which
i
can
with
propriety
introduce
him
to
the
rest
of
you
perhaps
the
gentleman
himself
might
object
to
that
put
in
queen
elizabeth
if
i
remember
rightly
your
last
customer
was
very
much
dissatisfied
with
the
trim
you
gave
him
it
will
be
unnecessary
to
do
what
delilah
proposes
said
noah
with
a
kindly
smile
as
she
rose
up
from
the
corner
in
which
she
had
been
sitting
an
interested
listener
i
can
introduce
the
gentleman
to
you
all
with
perfect
propriety
he
a
member
of
my
family
his
grandfather
was
the
a
thousand
and
eight
times
removed
of
my
son
shem
on
his
father
side
his
relationship
to
me
is
therefore
obvious
though
from
what
i
know
of
his
reputation
i
think
he
takes
more
after
my
husband
ancestors
than
my
own
willie
dear
these
ladies
are
friends
of
mine
ladies
this
young
man
is
one
of
my
most
famous
descendants
he
has
been
a
man
of
many
adventures
and
he
has
been
hanged
once
which
far
from
making
him
undesirable
as
an
acquaintance
has
served
merely
to
render
him
harmless
and
therefore
a
safe
person
to
know
now
my
son
go
ahead
and
speak
your
piece
the
good
old
spirit
sat
down
and
the
scruples
of
the
objectors
having
thus
been
satisfied
captain
kidd
began
now
that
i
know
you
all
he
remarked
as
pleasantly
as
he
could
under
the
circumstances
i
feel
that
i
can
speak
more
freely
and
certainly
with
a
great
deal
less
embarrassment
than
if
i
were
addressing
a
gathering
of
entire
strangers
i
am
not
much
of
a
hand
at
speaking
and
have
always
felt
somewhat
nonplussed
at
finding
myself
in
a
position
of
this
nature
in
my
whole
career
i
never
experienced
but
one
irresistible
impulse
to
make
a
public
address
of
any
length
and
that
was
upon
that
unhappy
occasion
to
which
the
greatest
and
grandest
of
my
has
alluded
and
that
only
as
the
chain
by
which
i
was
suspended
in
tightened
about
my
vocal
chords
at
that
moment
i
could
have
talked
impromptu
for
a
year
so
fast
and
numerously
did
thoughts
of
the
uttermost
import
surge
upward
into
my
brain
but
circumstances
over
which
i
had
no
control
prevented
the
utterance
of
those
thoughts
and
that
speech
is
therefore
lost
to
the
world
he
has
the
gift
of
continuity
observed
madame
recamier
ought
to
be
in
the
united
states
senate
smiled
elizabeth
i
wish
i
could
make
up
my
mind
as
to
whether
he
is
outrageously
handsome
or
desperately
ugly
remarked
helen
of
troy
he
fascinates
me
but
whether
it
is
the
fascination
of
liking
or
of
horror
i
ca
tell
and
it
quite
important
ladies
resumed
the
captain
his
uneasiness
increasing
as
he
came
to
the
point
i
am
but
the
agent
of
your
respective
husbands
fiances
and
other
masculine
guardians
the
gentlemen
who
were
previously
the
tenants
of
this
have
delegated
to
me
the
important
and
i
may
add
highly
agreeable
task
of
showing
you
the
world
they
have
noted
of
late
years
the
growth
of
that
feeling
of
unrest
which
is
becoming
every
day
more
and
more
conspicuous
in
feminine
circles
in
all
parts
of
the
universe
on
the
earth
where
women
are
clamoring
to
vote
and
to
be
allowed
to
go
out
late
at
night
without
an
escort
in
hades
where
as
you
are
no
doubt
aware
the
management
of
the
government
has
fallen
almost
wholly
into
the
hands
of
the
furies
and
even
in
the
halls
of
jupiter
himself
where
i
am
credibly
informed
juno
has
been
taking
private
lessons
in
the
art
of
hurling
thunderbolts
information
which
the
extraordinary
quality
of
recent
electrical
storms
on
the
earth
would
seem
to
confirm
thunderbolts
of
late
years
have
been
cast
hither
and
yon
in
a
most
erratic
fashion
striking
where
they
were
least
expected
as
those
of
you
who
keep
in
touch
with
the
outer
world
must
be
fully
aware
now
actuated
by
their
usual
broad
and
liberal
motives
the
men
of
hades
wish
to
meet
the
views
of
you
ladies
to
just
that
extent
that
your
views
are
based
upon
a
wise
selection
in
turn
based
upon
experience
and
they
have
come
to
me
and
in
so
many
words
have
said
kidd
we
wish
the
women
of
hades
to
see
the
world
we
want
them
to
be
satisfied
we
do
not
like
this
constantly
increasing
spirit
of
unrest
we
who
have
seen
all
the
life
that
we
care
to
see
do
not
ourselves
feel
equal
to
the
task
of
showing
them
about
we
will
pay
you
liberally
if
you
will
take
our
which
they
have
always
been
anxious
to
enter
and
personally
conduct
our
beloved
ones
to
paris
london
and
elsewhere
let
them
see
as
much
of
life
as
they
can
stand
accord
them
every
privilege
spare
no
expense
only
bring
them
back
again
to
us
safe
and
sound
these
were
their
words
ladies
i
asked
them
why
they
did
come
along
themselves
saying
that
even
if
they
were
tired
of
it
all
they
should
make
some
personal
sacrifice
to
your
comfort
and
they
answered
reasonably
and
well
that
they
would
be
only
too
glad
to
do
so
but
that
they
feared
they
might
unconsciously
seem
to
exert
a
repressing
influence
upon
you
want
them
to
feel
absolutely
free
captain
kidd
said
they
if
we
are
along
they
may
not
feel
so
the
answer
was
convincing
ladies
and
i
accepted
the
commission
but
we
knew
nothing
of
all
this
interposed
elizabeth
the
subject
was
not
broached
to
us
by
our
husbands
brothers
fiances
or
fathers
my
brother
sir
walter
raleigh
cleopatra
chuckled
brother
brother
good
she
said
well
that
what
he
is
retorted
elizabeth
quickly
i
promised
to
be
a
sister
to
him
and
i
going
to
keep
my
word
that
the
kind
of
a
queen
i
am
i
was
about
to
remark
elizabeth
added
turning
to
the
captain
that
my
brother
sir
walter
raleigh
never
even
hinted
at
any
such
plan
and
usually
he
asked
my
advice
in
matters
of
so
great
importance
that
is
easily
accounted
for
madame
retorted
kidd
sir
walter
intended
this
as
a
little
surprise
for
you
that
is
all
the
arrangements
were
all
placed
in
his
hands
and
it
was
he
who
bound
us
all
to
secrecy
none
of
the
ladies
were
to
be
informed
of
it
it
does
not
sound
altogether
plausible
interposed
portia
if
you
ladies
do
not
object
i
should
like
to
this
ah
gentleman
kidd
paled
visibly
he
was
not
prepared
for
any
such
trial
however
he
put
as
good
a
face
on
the
matter
as
he
could
and
announced
his
willingness
to
answer
any
questions
that
he
might
be
asked
shall
we
put
him
under
oath
asked
cleopatra
as
you
please
ladies
said
the
pirate
a
pirate
word
is
as
good
as
his
bond
but
i
take
an
oath
if
you
choose
a
of
if
need
be
i
fancy
we
can
get
along
without
that
said
portia
now
captain
kidd
who
first
proposed
this
plan
socrates
said
kidd
unblushingly
with
a
sly
glance
at
xanthippe
what
cried
xanthippe
my
husband
propose
anything
that
would
contribute
to
my
pleasure
or
intellectual
advancement
bah
your
story
is
transparently
false
at
the
outset
nevertheless
said
kidd
the
scheme
was
proposed
by
socrates
he
said
a
trip
of
that
kind
for
xanthippe
would
be
very
restful
and
for
me
cried
xanthippe
sceptically
no
madame
for
him
retorted
kidd
ah
that
the
way
of
it
eh
said
xanthippe
flushing
to
the
roots
of
her
hair
very
likely
you
ah
you
will
excuse
my
doubting
your
word
captain
kidd
a
moment
since
i
withdraw
my
remark
and
in
order
to
make
fullest
reparation
i
beg
to
assure
these
ladies
that
i
am
now
perfectly
convinced
that
you
are
telling
the
truth
that
last
observation
is
just
like
my
husband
and
when
i
get
back
home
again
if
i
ever
do
well
ha
ha
we
have
a
merry
time
that
all
and
what
was
ah
bassanio
connection
with
this
affair
added
portia
hesitatingly
he
was
not
informed
of
it
said
kidd
archly
i
am
not
acquainted
with
bassanio
my
lady
but
i
overheard
sir
walter
enjoining
upon
the
others
the
absolute
necessity
of
keeping
the
whole
affair
from
bassanio
because
he
was
afraid
he
would
not
consent
to
it
has
a
most
beautiful
wife
gentlemen
said
sir
walter
he
would
think
of
parting
with
her
under
any
circumstances
therefore
let
us
keep
our
intentions
a
secret
from
him
i
did
not
hear
whom
the
gentleman
married
madame
but
the
others
prince
hamlet
the
duke
of
buckingham
and
louis
the
fourteenth
all
agreed
that
bassanio
was
too
beautiful
a
person
to
be
separated
from
and
that
it
was
better
therefore
to
keep
bassanio
in
the
dark
as
to
their
little
enterprise
until
it
was
too
late
for
him
to
interfere
a
pink
glow
of
pleasure
suffused
the
lovely
countenance
of
the
examiner
and
it
did
not
require
a
very
sharp
eye
to
see
that
the
wily
kidd
had
completely
won
her
over
to
his
side
on
the
other
hand
elizabeth
brow
became
as
corrugated
as
her
ruff
and
the
spirit
of
the
pirate
shivered
to
the
core
as
he
turned
and
gazed
upon
that
glowering
face
sir
walter
agreed
to
that
did
he
snapped
elizabeth
and
yet
he
was
willing
to
part
with
ah
his
sister
well
your
majesty
began
kidd
hesitatingly
you
see
it
was
this
way
sir
walter
er
did
say
that
but
ah
he
ah
but
he
added
that
he
of
course
merely
judged
er
this
man
bassanio
feelings
by
his
own
in
parting
from
his
sister
did
he
say
sister
cried
elizabeth
well
no
not
in
those
words
shuffled
kidd
perceiving
quickly
wherein
his
error
lay
but
ah
i
jumped
at
the
conclusion
seeing
his
intense
enthusiasm
for
the
lady
beauty
and
er
intellectual
qualities
that
he
referred
to
you
and
it
is
from
yourself
that
i
have
gained
my
knowledge
as
to
the
fraternal
not
to
say
sororal
relationship
that
exists
between
you
that
man
a
diplomat
from
diplomaville
muttered
sir
henry
morgan
who
with
abeuchapeta
and
conrad
was
listening
at
the
port
without
he
is
that
said
abeuchapeta
but
he
ca
last
much
longer
perspiring
like
a
pitcher
of
on
a
hot
day
and
a
spirit
of
his
size
and
volatile
nature
ca
stand
much
of
that
without
evaporating
if
you
will
observe
him
closely
you
will
see
that
his
left
arm
already
has
vanished
into
thin
air
by
jove
whispered
conrad
that
a
fact
if
they
do
let
up
on
him
he
vanish
he
getting
excessively
tenuous
about
the
top
of
his
head
all
of
which
was
only
too
true
subjected
to
a
scrutiny
which
he
had
little
expected
the
deceitful
ambassador
of
the
thieving
band
was
rapidly
dissipating
and
as
those
without
had
so
fearsomely
noted
was
in
imminent
danger
of
complete
sublimation
which
in
the
case
of
one
possessed
of
so
little
elementary
purity
meant
nothing
short
of
annihilation
fortunately
for
kidd
however
his
wonderful
tact
had
stemmed
the
tide
of
suspicion
elizabeth
was
satisfied
with
his
explanation
and
in
the
minds
of
at
least
three
of
the
most
influential
ladies
on
board
portia
xanthippe
and
elizabeth
he
had
become
a
creature
worthy
of
credence
which
meant
that
he
had
nothing
more
to
fear
i
am
prepared
your
majesty
said
elizabeth
addressing
cleopatra
to
accept
from
this
time
on
the
gentleman
word
the
little
that
he
has
already
told
us
is
with
truth
i
should
like
to
ask
however
one
more
question
and
that
is
how
our
gentleman
friends
expected
to
embark
us
upon
this
voyage
without
letting
us
into
the
secret
oh
as
for
that
replied
kidd
with
a
sigh
of
relief
for
he
too
had
noticed
the
gradual
evaporation
of
his
arm
and
the
incipient
etherization
of
his
cranium
as
for
that
it
was
simple
enough
there
was
to
have
been
a
day
set
apart
for
ladies
day
at
the
club
and
when
you
were
all
on
board
we
were
quietly
to
weigh
anchor
and
start
the
fact
that
you
had
anticipated
the
day
of
your
own
volition
was
telephoned
by
my
scouts
to
me
at
my
headquarters
and
that
news
was
by
me
transmitted
by
messenger
to
sir
walter
at
charon

observed
xanthippe
as
she
reflected
upon
the
words
the

had
attributed
to
socrates
i
did
believe
him
at
first
but
when
he
told
me
what
my
tempered
philosopher
had
said
i
was
convinced
he
a
sweet
child
interposed
noah
fondly
one
of
my
favorite
grandchildren
which
makes
it
embarrassing
for
me
to
say
cried
cassandra
starting
up
angrily
that
he
is
a

caitiff
had
a
bomb
been
dropped
in
the
middle
of
the
room
it
could
not
have
created
a
greater
sensation
than
the
words
of
cassandra
what
cried
several
voices
at
once
a
caitiff
a
caitiff
with
a
capital
k
retorted
cassandra
i
know
that
because
while
he
was
telling
his
story
i
was
listening
to
it
with
one
ear
and
looking
forward
into
the
middle
of
next
week
with
the
other
i
mean
the
other
eye
and
i
saw
yes
you
saw
cried
cleopatra
i
saw
that
he
was
deceiving
us
mark
my
words
ladies
he
is
a
base
caitiff
replied
cassandra
a
base
caitiff
what
did
you
see
cried
elizabeth
excitedly
this
said
cassandra
and
she
began
a
narration
of
future
events
which
i
must
defer
to
the
next
chapter
meanwhile
his
associates
were
endeavoring
to
restore
the
evaporated
portions
of
the
prostrated
kidd
spirit
anatomy
by
the
use
of
a
but
with
indifferent
success
kidd
training
had
not
fitted
him
for
an
intellectual
combat
with
superior
women
and
he
suffered
accordingly
chapter
x
a
warning
accepted
it
is
with
no
desire
to
interrupt
my
friend
cassandra
unnecessarily
said
noah
as
the
prophetess
was
about
to
narrate
her
story
that
i
rise
to
beg
her
to
remember
that
as
an
ancestress
of
captain
kidd
i
hope
she
will
spare
a
feelings
if
anything
in
the
story
she
is
about
to
tell
is
improper
to
be
placed
before
the
young
i
have
been
so
shocked
by
the
stories
of
perfidy
and
baseness
generally
that
have
been
published
of
late
years
that
i
would
interpose
a
protest
while
there
is
yet
time
if
there
is
a
line
in
cassandra
story
which
ought
to
be
withheld
from
the
public
a
protest
based
upon
my
affection
for
posterity
and
in
the
interests
of
morality
everywhere
you
may
rest
easy
upon
that
score
my
dear
noah
said
the
prophetess
what
i
have
to
say
would
commend
itself
i
am
sure
even
to
the
ears
of
a
british
matron
and
while
it
is
as
complete
a
demonstration
of
man
perfidy
as
ever
was
it
is
none
the
less
as
harmless
a
little
tale
as
the
dottie
dimple
books
or
any
other
more
recent
study
of
new
england
character
thank
you
for
the
load
your
words
have
lifted
from
my
mind
said
noah
settling
back
in
her
chair
a
satisfied
expression
upon
her
gentle
countenance
i
hope
you
will
understand
why
i
spoke
and
withal
why
modern
literature
generally
has
been
so
distressful
to
me
when
you
reflect
that
the
world
is
satisfied
that
most
of
criminal
instincts
are
the
result
of
heredity
and
that
noah
and
i
are
unable
to
shift
the
responsibility
for
posterity
to
other
shoulders
than
our
own
you
will
understand
my
position
we
were
about
the
most
domestic
old
couple
that
ever
lived
and
when
we
see
the
long
and
varied
assortment
of
crimes
that
are
cropping
out
everywhere
in
our
descendants
it
is
painful
to
us
to
realize
what
a
pair
of
unconsciously
wicked
old
fogies
we
must
have
been
we
all
understand
that
said
cleopatra
kindly
and
we
are
all
prepared
to
acquit
you
of
any
responsibility
for
the
advanced
condition
of
wickedness
man
has
progressed
since
your
time
my
dear
grandma
and
the
modern
improvements
in
the
science
of
crime
are
no
more
attributable
to
you
than
the
invention
of
the
telephone
or
the
oyster
cocktail
is
attributable
to
your
husband
thank
you
kindly
murmured
the
old
lady
and
she
resumed
her
knitting
upon
a
phantom
which
she
was
making
as
a
christmas
surprise
for
her
husband
when
captain
kidd
began
his
story
said
cassandra
he
made
one
very
bad
mistake
and
yet
one
which
was
prompted
by
that
courtesy
which
all
men
instinctively
adopt
when
addressing
women
when
he
entered
the
room
he
removed
his
hat
and
therein
lay
his
fatal
error
if
he
wished
to
convince
me
of
the
truth
of
his
story
for
with
his
hat
removed
i
could
see
the
workings
of
his
mind
while
you
ladies
were
watching
his
lips
or
his
eyes
some
of
you
taking
in
the
gorgeous
details
of
his
dress
all
of
you
hanging
upon
his
every
word
i
kept
my
eye
fixed
firmly
upon
his
imagination
and
i
saw
what
you
did
not
that
he
was
drawing
wholly
upon
that
how
extraordinary
cried
elizabeth
yes
and
fortunate
said
cassandra
had
i
not
done
so
a
week
hence
we
should
every
one
of
us
have
been
lost
in
the
surging
wickedness
of
the
city
of
paris
but
cassandra
said
trilby
who
was
anxious
to
return
once
more
to
the
beautiful
city
by
the
seine
he
told
us
we
were
going
to
paris
of
course
he
did
said
madame
recamier
and
in
so
many
words
certainly
he
was
not
drawing
upon
his
imagination
there
and
one
might
be
lost
in
a
very
much
worse
place
put
in
marguerite
de
valois
if
indeed
it
were
possible
to
lose
us
in
paris
at
all
i
fancy
that
i
know
enough
about
paris
to
find
my
way
about
humph
ejaculated
cassandra
what
a
foolish
little
thing
you
are
you
do
imagine
that
the
paris
of
is
the
paris
of
your
time
or
even
the
paris
of
that
sweet
child
trilby
time
do
you
if
you
do
you
are
very
much
mistaken
i
almost
wish
i
had
not
warned
you
of
your
danger
and
had
let
you
go
just
to
see
those
eyes
of
yours
open
with
amazement
at
the
change
you
find
your
louvre
a
very
different
sort
of
a
place
from
what
it
used
to
be
my
dear
lady
those
pleasing
little
windows
through
which
your
relations
were
wont
in
olden
times
to
indulge
in
target
practice
at
people
who
did
go
to
their
church
are
now
kept
closed
the
galleries
which
used
to
swarm
with
people
many
of
whom
ought
to
have
been
hanged
now
swarm
with
pictures
many
of
which
ought
not
to
have
been
hung
the
romance
which
clung
about
its
walls
is
as
much
a
part
of
the
dead
past
as
yourselves
and
were
you
to
materialize
suddenly
therein
you
would
find
yourselves
jostled
and
hustled
and
trodden
upon
by
the
curious
from
other
lands
with
argus
eyes
taking
in
five
hundred
pictures
a
minute
and
traversing
those
halls
at
a
rate
of
speed
at
which
mercury
himself
would
stand
aghast
but
my
beloved
tuileries
cried
marie
antoinette
has
been
swallowed
up
by
a
for
the
people
my
dear
said
cassandra
gently
paris
is
no
place
for
us
and
it
is
the
intention
of
these
men
in
whose
hands
we
are
to
take
us
there
and
then
desert
us
can
you
imagine
anything
worse
than
ourselves
the
phantoms
of
a
glorious
romantic
past
basely
deserted
in
the
streets
of
a
wholly
strange
superficial
material
city
of
what
do
you
think
elizabeth
would
be
your
fate
if
faint
and
famished
you
begged
for
sustenance
at
an
english
door
and
when
asked
your
name
and
profession
were
to
reply
queen
of
england
insane
asylum
said
elizabeth
shortly
precisely
so
in
paris
with
the
rest
of
us
said
cassandra
how
do
you
know
all
this
asked
trilby
still
unconvinced
i
know
it
just
as
you
knew
how
to
become
a
prima
donna
said
cassandra
i
am
however
my
own
svengali
which
is
rather
preferable
to
the
patent
detachable
hypnotizer
you
had
i
hypnotize
myself
and
direct
my
mind
into
the
future
i
was
a
professional
forecaster
in
the
days
of
ancient
troy
and
if
my
revelations
had
been
heeded
the
priam
family
would
i
doubt
not
still
be
doing
business
at
the
old
stand
and
aeneas
would
not
have
grown
shouldered
giving
his
poor
father
a
ride
on
the
opening
night
of
the
so
graphically
depicted
by
virgil
i
never
heard
about
that
said
trilby
it
sounds
like
a
very
funny
story
though
well
it
was
so
humorous
for
some
as
it
was
for
others
said
cassandra
with
a
sly
glance
at
helen
the
fact
is
until
you
mentioned
it
yourself
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
there
was
much
fun
in
any
portion
of
the
trojan
incident
excepting
perhaps
the
delirium
tremens
of
old
laocoon
who
got
no
more
than
he
deserved
for
stealing
my
thunder
i
had
warned
troy
against
the
greeks
and
they
all
laughed
at
me
and
said
my
eye
to
the
future
was
strabismatic
that
the
greeks
could
get
into
troy
at
all
even
if
they
wanted
to
and
then
the
greeks
made
a
great
wooden
horse
as
a
gift
for
the
trojans
and
when
i
turned
my
gaze
upon
it
i
saw
that
it
contained
about
six
brigades
of
infantry
three
artillery
regiments
and
by
the
score
it
was
a
sort
of
military
ark
but
i
knew
that
the
prejudice
against
me
was
so
strong
that
nobody
would
believe
what
i
told
them
so
i
said
nothing
my
prophecies
never
came
true
they
said
failing
to
observe
that
my
warning
as
to
what
would
be
was
in
itself
the
cause
of
their
fulfilment
but
desiring
to
save
troy
i
sent
for
laocoon
and
told
him
all
about
it
and
he
went
out
and
announced
it
as
his
own
private
prophecy
and
then
having
tried
to
drown
his
conscience
in
strong
waters
he
fell
a
victim
to
the
usual
serpentine
hallucination
and
everybody
said
he
was
sober
and
therefore
unworthy
of
belief
the
horse
was
accepted
hauled
into
the
city
and
that
night
orders
came
from
hindquarters
to
the
regiments
concealed
inside
to
march
they
marched
and
next
morning
troy
had
been
removed
from
the
map
ninety
per
cent
of
the
trojans
died
suddenly
and
aeneas
grabbing
up
his
family
in
one
hand
and
his
gods
in
the
other
went
yachting
for
several
seasons
ultimately
settling
down
in
italy
all
of
this
could
have
been
avoided
if
the
trojans
would
have
taken
the
hint
from
my
prophecies
they
preferred
however
not
to
do
it
with
the
result
that
no
one
but
helen
and
myself
knows
even
where
troy
was
and
we
never
tell
it
is
all
true
said
helen
proudly
i
was
the
woman
who
was
at
the
bottom
of
it
all
and
i
can
testify
that
cassandra
always
told
the
truth
which
is
why
she
was
always
so
unpopular
when
anything
that
was
unpleasant
happened
after
it
was
all
over
she
would
turn
and
say
sweetly
told
you
so
she
was
the
original
told
you
so
nuisance
and
of
course
she
had
the
newspapyruses
down
on
her
because
she
never
left
them
any
sensation
to
spring
upon
the
public
if
she
had
only
told
a
fib
once
in
a
while
the
public
would
have
had
more
confidence
in
her
thank
you
for
your
endorsement
said
cassandra
with
a
nod
at
helen
with
such
testimony
i
can
not
see
how
you
can
refrain
from
taking
my
advice
in
this
matter
and
i
tell
you
ladies
that
this
man
kidd
has
made
his
story
up
out
of
whole
cloth
the
men
of
hades
had
no
more
to
do
with
our
being
here
than
we
had
they
were
as
much
surprised
as
we
are
to
find
us
gone
kidd
himself
was
not
aware
of
our
presence
and
his
object
in
taking
us
to
paris
is
to
leave
us
stranded
there
disembodied
spirits
vagrant
souls
with
no
familiar
haunts
to
haunt
no
place
to
rest
and
nothing
before
us
save
perpetual
exile
in
a
world
that
would
have
no
sympathy
for
us
in
our
misfortune
and
no
belief
in
our
continued
existence
but
what
then
shall
we
do
cried
ophelia
wringing
her
hands
in
despair
it
is
a
terrible
problem
said
cleopatra
anxiously
and
yet
it
does
seem
as
if
our
woman
instinct
ought
to
show
us
some
way
out
of
our
trouble
the
committee
on
treachery
said
delilah
has
already
suggested
a
party
with
lucretia
borgia
in
charge
of
the
lobster
newberg
that
is
true
said
lucretia
but
i
find
in
going
through
my
reticule
that
my
maid
for
some
reason
unknown
to
me
has
failed
to
renew
my
supply
of
poisons
i
shall
discharge
her
on
my
return
home
for
she
knows
that
i
never
go
anywhere
without
them
but
that
does
not
help
matters
at
this
juncture
the
sad
fact
remains
that
i
could
prepare
a
thousand
delicacies
for
these
pirates
without
fatal
results
you
mean
immediately
fatal
do
you
not
suggested
xanthippe
i
could
myself
prepare
a
cake
which
would
in
time
reduce
our
captors
to
a
state
of
absolute
dependence
but
of
course
the
effect
is
not
immediate
we
might
give
a
musicale
and
let
trilby
sing
bolt
to
them
suggested
marguerite
de
valois
with
a
giggle
do
be
flippant
please
said
portia
we
have
time
to
waste
on
flippant
suggestions
perhaps
a
of
these
pirates
supplemented
by
a
would
be
a
bad
thing
i
prosecute
the
case
you
forget
that
you
are
dealing
with
immortal
spirits
observed
cleopatra
if
these
creatures
were
mortals
hanging
them
would
be
all
right
and
comparatively
easy
considering
that
we
outnumber
them
ten
to
one
and
have
many
resources
for
getting
them
more
or
less
in
our
power
but
they
are
not
they
have
gone
through
the
refining
process
of
dissolution
once
and
there
an
end
to
that
our
only
resource
is
in
the
line
of
deception
and
if
we
can
not
deceive
them
then
we
have
ceased
to
be
women
that
is
truly
said
observed
elizabeth
and
inasmuch
as
we
have
already
provided
ourselves
with
a
suitable
committee
for
the
preparation
of
our
plans
of
a
deceptive
nature
i
move
as
the
easiest
possible
solution
of
the
difficulty
for
the
rest
of
us
that
the
committee
on
treachery
be
requested
to
go
at
once
into
executive
session
with
orders
not
to
come
out
of
it
until
they
have
suggested
a
plausible
plan
of
campaign
against
our
abductors
we
must
be
rid
of
them
let
the
committee
on
treachery
say
how
second
the
motion
said
noah
you
are
a
very
young
woman
lizzie
and
your
grandmother
is
proud
of
you
the
committee
on
treachery
were
about
to
protest
but
the
chair
refused
to
entertain
any
debate
upon
the
question
which
was
put
and
carried
with
a
storm
of
approval
five
minutes
later
a
note
was
handed
through
the
port
addressed
to
cleopatra
which
read
as
follows
dear
madame
six
bells
has
just
struck
and
the
officers
and
crew
are
hungry
will
you
and
your
fair
companions
with
us
in
our
enterprise
by
having
a
hearty
dinner
ready
within
two
hours
a
speck
has
appeared
on
the
horizon
which
betokens
a
coming
storm
else
we
would
prepare
our
supper
ourselves
as
it
is
we
feel
that
your
safety
depends
on
our
remaining
on
deck

there
is
any
beer
on
the

we
prefer
it
to
tea

suffice

henry
morgan
bart
first
mate
hurrah
cried
cleopatra
as
she
read
this
communication
i
have
an
idea
tell
the
committee
on
treachery
to
appear
before
the
full
meeting
at
once
the
committee
was
summoned
and
cleopatra
announced
her
plan
of
operation
and
it
was
unanimously
adopted
but
what
it
was
we
shall
have
to
wait
for
another
chapter
to
learn
chapter
xi
marooned
when
captain
holmes
arrived
upon
deck
he
seized
his
glass
and
gazing
intently
through
it
for
a
moment
perceived
that
the
faithful
shem
had
not
deceived
him
flying
at
from
a
rude
roughly
hewn
pole
set
upon
a
rocky
height
was
the
black
flag
emblem
of
piracy
and
as
artemus
ward
put
it
with
the
second
joints
reversed
it
was
in
very
truth
a
signal
of
distress
i
make
it
a
point
never
to
be
surprised
observed
holmes
as
he
peered
through
the
glass
but
this
beats
me
i
did
know
there
was
an
island
of
this
nature
in
these
latitudes
blackstone
go
below
and
pipe
captain
cook
on
deck
perhaps
he
knows
what
island
that
is
you
have
to
excuse
me
captain
holmes
replied
the
judge
i
did
ship
on
this
voyage
as
a
or
a
therefore
i
bonaparte
put
the
judge
in
irons
interrupted
holmes
sternly
i
expect
to
be
obeyed
judge
blackstone
whether
you
shipped
as
a
lord
or
a
steward
when
i
issue
an
order
it
must
be
obeyed
step
lively
there
bonaparte
get
his
honor
ironed
and
summon
your
marines
we
may
have
work
to
do
before
night
hamlet
pipe
captain
cook
on
deck
aye
aye
sir
replied
hamlet
with
alacrity
as
he
made
off
that
the
way
to
obey
orders
said
holmes
with
a
scornful
glance
at
blackstone
i
was
only
jesting
captain
said
the
latter
paling
somewhat
that
all
right
said
holmes
taking
up
his
glass
again
so
was
i
when
i
ordered
you
in
irons
and
in
order
that
you
may
appreciate
the
full
force
of
the
joke
i
repeat
it
bonaparte
do
your
duty
in
an
instant
the
order
was
obeyed
and
the
unhappy
judge
shortly
found
himself
manacled
and
alone
in
the
forecastle
meanwhile
captain
cook
in
response
to
the
commander
order
repaired
to
the
deck
and
scanned
the
distant
coast
i
ca
place
it
he
said
it
ca
be
monte
cristo
can
it
no
it
ca
said
the
count
who
stood
hard
by
my
island
was
in
the
mediterranean
and
even
if
it
dragged
anchor
it
could
have
got
out
through
the
strait
of
gibraltar
perhaps
it
robinson
crusoe
island
suggested
doctor
johnson
not
it
observed
de
foe
if
it
is
the
rest
of
you
will
please
keep
off
it
mine
and
i
may
want
to
use
it
again
i
been
having
a
number
of
interviews
with
crusoe
latterly
and
he
given
me
a
lot
of
new
points
which
i
intend
incorporating
in
a
sequel
for
the
cimmerian
magazine
well
in
the
name
of
atlas
what
island
is
it
then
roared
holmes
angrily
what
is
the
matter
with
all
you
learned
lubbers
that
i
have
brought
along
on
this
trip
do
you
suppose
i
brought
you
to
whistle
up
favorable
winds
not
by
the
beard
of
the
prophet
i
brought
you
to
give
me
information
and
now
when
i
ask
for
the
name
of
a
simple
little
island
like
that
in
plain
sight
there
not
one
of
you
able
so
much
as
to
guess
at
it
reasonably
the
next
man
i
ask
for
information
goes
into
irons
with
judge
blackstone
if
he
answer
me
instantly
with
the
information
i
want
munchausen
what
island
is
that
ahem
that
replied
munchausen
trembling
as
he
reflected
upon
the
captain
threat
what
nobody
knows
what
island
that
is
why
you
surprise
me
see
here
baron
retorted
holmes
menacingly
i
ask
you
a
plain
question
and
i
want
a
plain
answer
with
no
evasions
to
gain
time
now
it
irons
or
an
answer
what
island
is
that
it
an
island
that
does
appear
on
any
chart
captain
munchausen
responded
instantly
pulling
himself
together
for
a
mighty
effort
and
it
has
never
been
given
a
name
but
as
you
insist
upon
having
one
we
call
it
holmes
island
in
your
honor
it
is
not
stationary
it
is
a
floating
island
of
lava
formation
and
is
a
menace
to
every
craft
that
goes
to
sea
i
spent
a
year
of
my
life
upon
it
once
and
it
is
more
barren
than
the
desert
of
sahara
because
you
can
not
raise
even
sand
upon
it
and
it
is
devoid
of
water
of
any
sort
salt
or
fresh
what
did
you
live
on
during
that
year
asked
holmes
eying
him
narrowly
canned
food
from
wrecks
replied
the
baron
feeling
much
easier
now
that
he
had
got
a
fair
start
canned
food
from
wrecks
commander
there
is
a
magnetic
property
in
the
upper
stratum
of
this
piece
of
derelict
real
estate
sir
which
attracts
to
it
every
bit
of
canned
substance
that
is
lost
overboard
in
all
parts
of
the
world
a
ship
is
wrecked
say
in
the
pacific
ocean
and
ultimately
all
the
loose
metal
upon
her
will
succumb
to
the
irresistible
attraction
of
this
magnetic
upper
stratum
and
will
find
its
way
to
its
shores
so
in
any
other
part
of
the
earth
everything
metallic
turns
up
here
sooner
or
later
and
when
you
consider
that
thousands
of
vessels
go
down
every
year
vessels
which
are
provisioned
with
tinned
foods
only
you
will
begin
to
comprehend
how
many
millions
of
pounds
of
preserved
salmon
sardines
pate
de
foie
gras
peaches
and
so
on
can
be
found
strewn
along
its
coast
munchausen
said
holmes
smiling
by
the
blush
upon
your
cheek
coupled
with
an
occasional
uneasy
glance
of
the
eye
i
know
that
for
once
you
are
standing
upon
the
to
you
unfamiliar
ground
of
truth
and
i
admire
you
for
it
there
is
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
in
telling
the
truth
occasionally
you
are
a
man
after
my
own
heart
come
below
and
have
a
cocktail
captain
cook
take
command
of
the
gehenna
during
my
absence
head
her
straight
for
holmes
island
and
when
you
discover
anything
new
let
me
know
bonaparte
in
honor
of
munchausen
remarkable
genius
i
proclaim
general
amnesty
to
our
prisoners
and
you
may
release
blackstone
from
his
dilemma
and
if
you
have
any
tin
soldiers
among
your
marines
see
that
they
are
lashed
to
the
rigging
i
do
want
this
electric
island
of
the
baron
to
get
a
grip
upon
my
military
force
at
this
juncture
with
this
holmes
followed
by
munchausen
went
below
and
the
two
worthies
were
soon
deep
in
the
mysteries
of
a
phantom
cocktail
while
doctor
johnson
and
de
foe
gazed
mournfully
out
over
the
ocean
at
the
floating
island
de
foe
said
johnson
that
ought
to
be
a
lesson
to
you
this
realism
that
you
tie
up
to
is
all
right
when
you
are
alone
with
your
conscience
but
when
there
are
great
things
afoot
an
imagination
and
a
broad
view
as
to
the
limitations
of
truth
are
at
all
bad
you
or
i
might
now
be
drinking
that
cocktail
with
holmes
if
we
only
risen
to
the
opportunity
the
way
munchausen
did
that
is
true
said
de
foe
sadly
but
i
did
suppose
he
wanted
that
kind
of
information
i
could
have
spun
a
better
yarn
than
that
of
munchausen
with
my
eyes
shut
i
supposed
he
wanted
truth
and
i
gave
it
i
like
to
know
what
has
become
of
the
said
raleigh
anxiously
gazing
through
the
glass
at
the
island
i
can
see
old
henry
morgan
sitting
down
there
on
the
rocks
with
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
his
chin
in
his
hands
and
kidd
and
abeuchapeta
are
standing
back
of
him
yelling
like
mad
but
there
is
a
boat
in
sight
who
is
that
man
off
to
the
right
dancing
a
fandango
asked
johnson
it
looks
like
conrad
but
i
ca
tell
he
appears
to
have
gone
crazy
he
got
that
wild
look
on
his
face
which
betokens
insanity
we
have
to
be
careful
in
our
parleyings
with
these
people
said
raleigh
anything
new
asked
holmes
returning
to
the
deck
smacking
his
lips
in
enjoyment
of
the
cocktail
no
except
that
we
are
almost
within
hailing
distance
said
cook
then
give
orders
to
cast
anchor
observed
holmes
bonaparte
take
a
crew
of
picked
men
ashore
and
bring
those
pirates
aboard
take
the
three
musketeers
with
you
and
do
let
kidd
or
morgan
give
you
any
back
talk
if
they
try
any
funny
business
exorcise
them
aye
aye
sir
replied
bonaparte
and
in
a
moment
a
boat
had
been
lowered
and
a
sturdy
crew
of
sailors
were
pulling
for
the
shore
as
they
came
within
ten
feet
of
it
the
pirates
made
a
mad
dash
down
the
rough
rocky
hillside
and
clamored
to
be
saved
what
happened
to
you
cried
bonaparte
ordering
the
sailors
to
back
water
lest
the
pirates
should
too
hastily
board
the
boat
and
swamp
her
we
are
marooned
replied
kidd
and
on
an
island
of
a
volcanic
nature
there
is
a
square
inch
of
it
that
is
heated
up
to
degrees
and
seventeen
of
us
have
already
evaporated
conrad
has
lost
his
reason
abeuchapeta
has
become
so
tenuous
that
a
child
can
see
through
him
as
for
myself
i
am
growing
iridescent
with
anxiety
and
unless
i
get
off
this
infernal
furnace
i
disappear
like
a
for
heaven
sake
then
general
take
us
off
on
your
own
terms
we
accept
anything
as
if
in
confirmation
of
kidd
words
six
of
the
pirate
crew
collapsed
and
disappeared
into
thin
air
and
a
glance
at
abeuchapeta
was
proof
enough
of
his
condition
he
had
become
as
clear
as
crystal
and
had
it
not
been
for
his
rugged
outlines
he
would
hardly
have
been
visible
even
to
his
as
for
kidd
he
had
taken
on
the
aspect
of
a
rainbow
and
it
was
patent
that
his
fears
for
himself
were
all
too
well
founded
bonaparte
embarked
the
leaders
of
the
band
first
returning
subsequently
for
the
others
and
repaired
with
them
at
once
to
the
gehenna
where
they
were
ushered
into
the
presence
of
sherlock
holmes
the
first
question
he
asked
was
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
the
that
we
do
not
know
replied
kidd
mournfully
gazing
downward
at
the
wreck
of
his
former
self
we
came
ashore
sir
early
yesterday
morning
in
search
of
food
it
appears
that
when
acting
in
a
wholly
inexcusable
fashion
and
influenced
i
confess
it
by
motives
of
revenge
i
made
off
with
your
i
neglected
to
ascertain
if
it
were
well
stocked
with
provisions
a
fatal
error
for
when
we
endeavored
to
get
supper
we
discovered
that
the
larder
contained
but
half
a
bottle
of
farcie
olives
two
salted
almonds
and
a
soda
cracker
not
a
luxurious
feast
for
pirates
and
a
hundred
and
women
to
sit
down
to
that
all
nonsense
said
demosthenes
the
house
committee
had
provided
enough
supper
for
six
hundred
people
in
anticipation
of
the
appetite
of
the
members
on
their
return
from
the
fight
of
course
they
did
said
confucius
and
it
was
a
good
one
too
salads
salmon
glace
lobsters
every
blessed
thing
a
man
ca
get
at
home
we
had
and
what
is
more
they
been
delivered
on
board
i
saw
to
that
before
i
went
up
the
river
then
moaned
kidd
it
is
as
i
suspected
we
were
the
victims
of
base
treachery
on
the
part
of
those
women
treachery
well
i
like
that
call
it
reciprocity
said
hamlet
dryly
we
were
informed
by
the
ladies
that
there
was
nothing
for
supper
save
the
items
i
have
already
referred
to
said
kidd
i
see
it
all
now
we
had
tried
to
make
them
comfortable
and
i
put
myself
to
some
considerable
personal
inconvenience
to
make
them
easy
in
their
minds
but
they
were
ungrateful
whatever
induced
you
to
take
along
with
you
asked
socrates
we
did
want
them
said
kidd
we
did
know
they
were
on
board
until
it
was
too
late
to
turn
back
they
broken
in
and
were
having
the
club
all
to
themselves
in
your
absence
it
served
you
good
and
right
said
socrates
with
a
laugh
next
time
you
try
to
take
things
that
do
belong
to
you
maybe
you
be
a
trifle
more
careful
as
to
whose
property
you
confiscate
but
the
you
have
told
us
how
you
lost
her
put
in
raleigh
impatiently
well
it
was
this
way
said
kidd
when
in
response
to
our
polite
request
for
supper
the
ladies
said
there
was
nothing
to
eat
on
board
something
had
to
be
done
for
we
were
all
as
hungry
as
bears
and
we
decided
to
go
ashore
at
the
first
port
and
provision
unfortunately
the
crew
got
restive
and
when
this
floating
loomed
into
view
to
keep
them
we
decided
to
land
and
see
if
we
could
beg
borrow
or
steal
some
supplies
we
had
to
observations
taken
with
the
sextant
showed
that
there
was
no
port
within
five
hundred
miles
the
island
looked
as
if
it
might
be
inhabited
at
least
by
goats
and
ashore
we
went
every
man
of
us
leaving
the
safely
anchored
in
the
harbor
at
first
we
did
mind
the
heat
and
we
hunted
and
hunted
and
hunted
but
after
three
or
four
hours
i
began
to
notice
that
three
of
my
sailors
were
shrivelling
up
and
conrad
began
to
act
as
if
he
were
daft
hawkins
burst
right
before
my
eyes
then
abeuchapeta
got
prismatic
around
the
eyes
and
began
to
fade
and
i
noticed
a
slight
iridescence
about
myself
and
as
for
morgan
he
had
the
misfortune
to
lie
down
to
take
a
nap
in
the
sun
and
when
he
waked
up
his
whole
right
side
had
evaporated
then
we
saw
what
the
trouble
was
we
struck
this
lava
island
and
were
gradually
succumbing
to
its
intense
heat
we
rushed
madly
back
to
the
harbor
to
embark
and
our
ship
gentlemen
and
your
was
slowly
but
surely
disappearing
over
the
horizon
and
flying
from
the
at
the
fore
were
signals
of
farewell
with
an
unfeeling
below
to
this
effect
wait
up
for
us
we
may
not
be
back
until
late
there
was
a
pause
during
which
socrates
laughed
quietly
to
himself
while
abeuchapeta
and
the
morgan
wept
silently
that
gentlemen
of
the
associated
shades
is
all
i
know
of
the
whereabouts
of
the
continued
captain
kidd
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
ladies
practised
a
deception
to
our
discomfiture
and
i
must
say
that
i
think
it
was
exceedingly
clever
granting
that
it
was
desirable
to
be
rid
of
us
which
i
do
for
we
meant
well
by
them
and
they
would
have
enjoyed
themselves
but
cried
hamlet
may
they
not
now
be
in
peril
they
can
not
navigate
that
ship
they
got
her
out
of
the
harbor
all
right
said
kidd
and
i
judged
from
the
figure
at
the
helm
that
noah
had
taken
charge
what
kind
of
a
seaman
she
is
i
do
know
almighty
bad
ejaculated
shem
turning
pale
it
was
she
who
ran
us
ashore
on
ararat
well
was
that
what
you
wanted
queried
munchausen
what
we
wanted
cried
shem
well
i
guess
not
you
do
want
your
yacht
stranded
on
a
do
you
she
was
a
dead
loss
there
whereas
if
mother
had
been
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
ashore
we
could
have
waited
a
month
and
landed
on
the
seaboard
you
might
have
turned
her
into
a
summer
hotel
suggested
munchausen
well
we
must
up
anchor
and
away
said
holmes
our
pursuit
has
merely
begun
apparently
we
must
overtake
this
vessel
and
the
question
to
be
answered
is
where
that
easy
said
artemus
ward
from
what
shem
says
i
think
better
look
for
her
in
the
himalayas
and
meanwhile
what
shall
be
done
with
kidd
asked
holmes
he
ought
to
be
expelled
from
the
club
said
johnson
we
ca
expel
him
because
he
not
a
member
replied
raleigh
then
elect
him
suggested
ward
what
on
earth
for
growled
johnson
so
that
we
can
expel
him
said
ward
and
while
boswell
hero
was
trying
to
get
the
value
of
this
notion
through
his
head
the
others
repaired
to
the
deck
and
the
gehenna
was
soon
under
way
once
more
meanwhile
captain
kidd
and
his
fellows
were
put
in
irons
and
stowed
away
in
the
forecastle
alongside
of

the
escape
and
the
end
if
there
was
anxiety
on
board
of
the
gehenna
as
to
the
condition
and
whereabouts
of
the
there
was
by
no
means
less
uneasiness
upon
that
vessel
itself
cleopatra
scheme
for
ridding
herself
and
her
abducted
sisters
of
the
pirates
had
worked
to
a
charm
but
having
worked
thus
a
new
and
hitherto
problem
full
of
perplexities
bearing
upon
their
immediate
safety
now
confronted
them
the
sole
representative
of
a
seafaring
family
on
board
was
noah
and
it
did
not
require
much
time
to
see
that
her
knowledge
as
to
navigation
was
of
an
extremely
primitive
order
limited
indeed
to
the
science
of
floating
when
the
last
pirate
had
disappeared
behind
the
rocks
of
holmes
island
and
all
was
in
readiness
for
action
the
good
old
lady
who
had
hitherto
been
as
calm
and
unruffled
as
a
child
began
to
get
red
in
the
face
and
to
bustle
about
in
a
manner
which
betrayed
considerable
perturbation
of
spirit
now
noah
said
cleopatra
as
peeping
out
from
the
room
window
she
saw
morgan
disappearing
in
the
distance
the
coast
is
clear
and
i
resign
my
position
of
chairman
to
you
we
place
the
vessel
in
your
hands
and
ourselves
subject
to
your
orders
you
are
in
command
what
do
you
wish
us
to
do
very
well
replied
noah
putting
down
her
knitting
and
starting
for
the
deck
i
not
certain
but
i
think
the
first
thing
to
do
is
to
get
her
moving
do
you
know
i
never
discovered
whether
this
boat
was
a
steamboat
or
a
does
anybody
know
i
think
it
has
a
naphtha
tank
and
a
propeller
said
elizabeth
although
i
do
know
it
seems
to
me
my
brother
raleigh
told
me
they
had
a
naphtha
engine
put
in
last
winter
after
the
freshet
when
the
was
carried
ten
miles
down
the
river
and
had
to
be
towed
back
at
enormous
expense
they
put
it
in
so
that
if
she
were
carried
away
again
she
could
get
back
of
her
own
power
that
unfortunate
said
noah
because
i
do
know
anything
about
these
new
fangled
notions
if
there
any
one
here
who
knows
anything
about
naphtha
engines
i
wish
they
speak
i
of
the
opinion
said
portia
that
i
can
study
out
the
theory
of
it
in
a
short
while
very
well
then
said
noah
you
can
do
it
i
appoint
you
engineer
and
give
you
all
your
orders
now
right
away
in
advance
set
her
going
and
keep
her
going
and
do
stop
without
a
written
order
signed
by
me
we
might
as
well
be
very
careful
and
have
everything
done
properly
and
it
might
happen
that
in
the
excitement
of
our
trip
you
would
misunderstand
my
spoken
orders
and
make
a
fatal
error
therefore
pay
no
attention
to
unwritten
orders
that
will
do
for
you
for
the
present
xanthippe
you
may
take
ophelia
and
madame
recamier
and
ten
other
ladies
and
every
morning
before
breakfast
swab
the
larboard
deck
cassandra
tuesdays
you
will
devote
to
polishing
the
brasses
in
the
and
the
balance
of
your
time
i
wish
you
to
expend
in
dusting
the
dido
you
always
were
strong
at
building
fires
i
make
you
chief
stoker
you
will
also
assist
lucretia
borgia
in
the
kitchen
inasmuch
as
the
latter
maid
has
neglected
to
supply
her
with
the
usual
line
of
poisons
i
think
we
can
safely
entrust
to
hands
the
responsibilities
of
the
culinary
department
i
perfectly
willing
to
do
anything
i
can
said
lucretia
but
i
must
confess
that
i
do
approve
of
your
methods
of
commanding
a
ship
a
ship
captain
is
a
domestic
martinet
as
you
are
setting
out
to
be
we
did
appoint
you
housekeeper
now
my
child
said
noah
firmly
i
do
not
wish
any
words
if
i
hear
any
more
impudence
from
you
i
put
you
ashore
without
a
reference
and
the
rest
of
you
i
would
warn
in
all
kindness
that
i
will
not
tolerate
insubordination
you
may
all
of
you
have
one
night
of
the
week
and
alternate
sundays
off
but
your
work
must
be
done
the
regimen
i
am
adopting
is
precisely
that
in
vogue
on
the
ark
only
i
did
have
the
help
i
have
now
and
things
got
into
very
bad
shape
we
were
out
forty
days
and
while
the
food
was
poor
and
the
service
execrable
we
never
lost
a
life
the
boat
gave
a
slight
tremor
hurrah
cried
elizabeth
clapping
her
hands
with
glee
we
are
off
i
will
repair
to
the
deck
and
get
our
bearings
said
noah
putting
her
shawl
over
her
shoulders
meantime
cleopatra
i
appoint
you
first
mate
see
that
things
are
tidied
up
a
bit
here
before
i
return
have
the
windows
washed
and
i
want
all
the
rugs
and
carpets
taken
up
and
shaken
portia
meanwhile
had
discovered
the
naphtha
engine
and
after
experimenting
several
times
with
the
various
levers
and
had
finally
managed
to
move
one
of
them
in
such
a
way
as
to
set
the
engine
going
and
the
wheel
began
to
revolve
are
we
going
all
right
she
cried
from
below
i
am
afraid
not
said
the
gallant
commander
the
wheel
is
roiling
up
the
water
at
a
great
rate
but
we
do
seem
to
be
going
ahead
very
fast
in
fact
we
simply
moving
round
and
round
as
though
we
were
on
a
pivot
i
afraid
we
aground
amidships
said
xanthippe
gazing
over
the
side
of
the
anxiously
she
certainly
acts
that
way
like
a
well
there
something
wrong
said
noah
and
we
got
to
hurry
and
find
out
what
it
is
or
those
men
will
be
back
and
we
shall
be
as
badly
off
as
ever
maybe
this
has
something
to
do
with
it
observed
mrs
lot
pointing
to
the
anchor
rope
it
looks
to
me
as
if
those
horrid
men
had
tied
us
fast
that
just
what
it
is
snapped
noah
they
guessed
our
plan
and
have
fastened
us
to
a
pole
or
something
but
i
imagine
we
can
untie
it
portia
who
had
come
on
deck
gave
a
short
little
laugh
why
of
course
we
do
move
she
said
we
are
anchored
what
that
queried
noah
we
never
had
an
experience
like
that
on
the
ark
portia
explained
the
science
of
the
anchor
what
nonsense
ejaculated
noah
how
can
we
get
away
from
it
we
got
to
pull
it
up
said
portia
order
all
hands
on
deck
and
have
it
pulled
up
it
ca
be
done
and
if
it
could
i
would
have
it
said
noah
indignantly
the
idea
lifting
heavy
pieces
of
iron
my
dear
portia
is
not
a
woman
work
send
for
delilah
and
let
her
cut
the
rope
with
her
scissors
it
would
take
her
a
week
to
cut
a
hawser
like
that
said
elizabeth
who
had
been
investigating
it
would
be
more
to
the
purpose
i
think
to
chop
it
in
two
with
an
axe
very
well
replied
noah
satisfied
i
do
care
how
it
is
done
as
long
as
it
is
done
quickly
it
would
never
do
for
us
to
be
recaptured
now
the
suggestion
of
elizabeth
was
carried
out
and
the
queen
herself
cut
the
hawser
with
six
strokes
of
the
axe
you
are
an
expert
with
it
are
you
smiled
cleopatra
i
am
indeed
replied
elizabeth
grimly
i
had
it
suspended
over
my
head
for
so
long
a
time
before
i
got
to
the
throne
that
i
help
familiarizing
myself
with
some
of
its
possibilities
ah
cried
noah
as
the
vessel
began
to
move
i
begin
to
feel
easier
it
looks
now
as
if
we
were
really
off
it
seems
to
me
though
said
cleopatra
gazing
forward
that
we
are
going
backward
oh
well
what
if
we
are
said
noah
we
did
that
on
the
ark
half
the
time
it
does
make
any
difference
which
way
we
are
going
as
long
as
we
go
does
it
why
of
course
it
does
cried
elizabeth
what
can
you
be
thinking
of
people
who
walk
backward
are
in
great
danger
of
running
into
other
people
why
not
the
same
with
ships
it
seems
to
me
it
a
very
dangerous
piece
of
business
sailing
backward
oh
nonsense
snapped
noah
you
are
as
timid
as
a
zebra
during
the
flood
we
sailed
days
and
days
and
days
going
backward
it
did
make
a
particle
of
difference
how
we
went
it
was
as
safe
one
way
as
another
and
we
got
just
as
far
away
in
the
end
our
main
object
now
is
to
get
away
from
the
pirates
and
that
what
we
are
doing
do
get
emotional
lizzie
and
remember
too
that
i
am
in
charge
if
i
think
the
boat
ought
to
go
sideways
sideways
she
shall
go
if
you
do
like
it
it
is
still
not
too
late
to
put
you
ashore
the
threat
calmed
elizabeth
somewhat
and
she
was
satisfied
and
all
went
well
with
them
even
if
portia
had
started
the
propeller
revolving
reverse
fashion
so
that
the
was
as
elizabeth
had
said
backing
her
way
through
the
ocean
the
day
passed
and
by
slow
degrees
the
island
and
the
marooned
pirates
faded
from
view
and
the
night
came
on
and
with
it
a
dense
fog
we
going
to
have
a
nasty
night
i
am
afraid
said
xanthippe
looking
anxiously
out
of
the
port
no
doubt
said
noah
pleasantly
i
sorry
for
those
who
have
to
be
out
in
it
that
what
i
was
thinking
about
observed
xanthippe
it
going
to
be
very
hard
on
us
keeping
watch
watch
for
what
demanded
noah
looking
over
the
tops
of
her
glasses
at
xanthippe
why
surely
you
are
going
to
have
lookouts
stationed
on
deck
said
elizabeth
not
at
all
said
noah
perfectly
absurd
we
never
did
it
on
the
ark
and
it
is
necessary
now
i
want
you
all
to
go
to
bed
at
ten
i
do
think
the
night
air
is
good
for
you
besides
it
is
proper
for
a
woman
to
be
out
after
dark
whether
she
new
or
not
but
my
dear
noah
expostulated
cleopatra
what
will
become
of
the
ship
i
guess
she
float
through
the
night
whether
we
are
on
deck
or
not
said
the
commander
the
ark
did
why
not
this
now
girls
these
yachting
notions
are
all
nonsense
it
night
and
there
a
fog
as
thick
as
a
all
about
us
if
there
were
a
hundred
of
you
upon
deck
with
ten
eyes
apiece
you
could
see
anything
you
might
much
better
be
in
bed
as
your
captain
chaperon
and
grandmother
i
command
you
to
stay
below
but
who
is
to
steer
queried
xanthippe
what
the
use
of
steering
until
we
can
see
where
to
steer
to
demanded
noah
i
certainly
do
intend
to
bother
with
that
tiller
until
some
reason
for
doing
it
arises
we
have
any
place
to
steer
to
yet
we
do
know
where
we
are
going
now
my
dear
children
be
reasonable
and
do
worry
me
i
had
a
very
hard
day
of
it
and
i
feel
my
responsibilities
keenly
just
let
me
manage
and
we
come
out
all
right
i
had
more
experience
than
any
of
you
and
if
a
terrible
crash
interrupted
the
old
lady
remarks
the
shivered
and
shook
careened
way
to
one
side
and
as
quickly
righted
and
stood
still
a
mad
rush
up
the
gangway
followed
and
in
a
moment
a
hundred
and
trembling
women
stood
upon
the
deck
gazing
with
horror
at
a
great
helpless
hulk
ten
feet
to
the
rear
fastened
by
broken
ropes
and
odd
pieces
of
rigging
to
the
of
the
sinking
slowly
but
surely
into
the
sea
it
was
the
gehenna
the
had
run
her
down
and
her
last
hour
had
come
but
thanks
to
the
stanchness
of
her
build
and
wonderful
beam
the
floating
had
withstood
the
shock
of
the
impact
and
now
rode
the
waters
as
gracefully
as
ever
portia
was
the
first
to
realize
the
extent
of
the
catastrophe
and
in
a
short
while
chairs
and
and
tables
everything
that
could
float
had
been
tossed
into
the
sea
to
the
struggling
immortals
therein
on
board
the
gehenna
those
who
had
not
cast
themselves
into
the
waters
under
the
cool
direction
of
holmes
and
bonaparte
calmly
lowered
the
boats
and
in
a
short
while
were
not
only
able
to
felicitate
themselves
upon
their
safety
but
had
likewise
the
good
fortune
to
rescue
their
more
impetuous
brethren
who
had
preferred
to
swim
for
it
ultimately
all
were
brought
aboard
the
in
safety
and
the
men
in
hades
were
once
more
reunited
to
their
wives
daughters
sisters
and
fiancees
and
elizabeth
had
the
satisfaction
of
once
more
saving
the
life
of
raleigh
by
throwing
him
her
ruff
as
she
had
done
a
year
or
so
previously
when
she
and
her
brother
had
been
upset
in
the
swift
current
of
the
river
styx
order
and
happiness
being
restored
holmes
took
command
of
the
boat
and
soon
navigated
her
safely
back
into
her
berth
the
gehenna
went
to
the
bottom
and
was
never
seen
again
and
when
the
roll
was
called
it
was
found
that
all
who
had
set
out
upon
her
had
returned
in
safety
save
shylock
kidd
sir
henry
morgan
and
abeuchapeta
but
even
they
were
not
lost
for
five
weeks
later
these
four
worthies
were
found
early
one
morning
drifting
slowly
up
the
river
styx
gazing
anxiously
out
from
the
top
of
a
and
yelling
lustily
for
help
and
here
endeth
the
chronicle
of
the
pursuit
of
the
good
old
boat
back
to
her
moorings
the
even
tenor
of
her
ways
was
once
more
resumed
but
with
one
slight
difference
the
ladies
became
eligible
for
membership
and
availing
themselves
of
the
privilege
began
to
think
less
and
less
of
the
advantages
of
being
men
and
to
rejoice
that
after
all
they
were
women
and
even
xanthippe
and
socrates
after
that
night
of
peril
reconciled
their
differences
and
no
longer
quarrel
as
to
which
is
the
more
entitled
to
wear
the
toga
of
authority
it
has
become
for
them
a
divided
skirt
as
for
kidd
and
his
fellows
they
have
never
recovered
from
the
effects
of
their
fearful
though
short
exile
upon
holmes
island
and
are
but
shadows
of
their
former
shades
whereas
sherlock
holmes
has
so
endeared
himself
to
his
friends
that
he
is
quite
as
popular
with
them
as
he
is
with
us
who
have
yet
to
cross
the
dark
river
and
be
subjected
to
the
scrutiny
of
the
committee
on
membership
at
the
on
the
styx
even
hawkshaw
has
been
able
to
detect
his
genius
