preface
any
person
having
a
reasonable
education
will
admit
that
there
are
many
planetary
worlds
besides
the
one
on
which
we
live
but
whether
or
not
they
are
inhabited
is
an
open
question
with
most
people
we
had
been
in
doubt
on
this
point
for
many
years
but
now
we
are
settled
in
our
conviction
that
human
life
exists
in
many
different
worlds
of
space
we
can
give
no
proof
of
this
except
that
we
have
just
returned
from
the
greatest
journey
we
ever
took
we
went
from
world
to
world
over
long
distances
of
space
as
easily
as
one
could
go
from
place
to
place
on
the
surface
of
our
earth
was
a
journey
of
the
for
surely
flesh
and
bone
could
not
have
traveled
such
amazing
distances
at
times
we
were
lost
to
this
world
being
entirely
absorbed
in
the
glimpses
of
other
worlds
that
were
flashing
upon
our
view
in
happy
succession
it
can
been
seen
without
saying
that
this
book
contains
no
more
than
a
fragment
of
the
things
we
saw
and
heard
the
fragment
that
is
most
easily
understood
by
human
creatures
born
under
the
rules
and
regulations
of
this
little
dark
world
of
ours
there
are
in
certain
other
worlds
such
wide
extremes
of
bodily
formation
and
mental
capacities
that
a
picture
of
them
in
word
or
art
would
only
be
unbearable
and
in
some
instances
decidedly
revolting
just
because
we
are
trained
here
to
one
set
of
standards
and
chained
to
one
surface
of
world
conditions
it
will
be
different
in
the
life
to
those
who
are
wise
enough
to
be
pure
and
good
in
this
world
to
make
the
book
as
practical
as
possible
we
have
given
a
picture
of
some
worlds
where
human
life
is
inferior
to
ours
and
of
others
where
it
is
vastly
superior
saying
nothing
of
the
millennial
life
which
we
found
in
far
off
space
comparisons
are
made
throughout
the
book
between
the
life
habits
and
customs
of
other
worlds
and
our
own
in
picturing
the
low
life
of
certain
worlds
we
are
led
to
see
what
a
highly
favored
and
greatly
civilized
people
we
are
and
in
describing
the
human
achievements
of
certain
other
worlds
we
are
led
to
see
how
short
a
distance
we
have
traveled
in
the
path
of
human
glory
and
civilization
we
have
also
endeavored
to
set
forth
in
this
humble
volume
the
common
relation
of
all
rational
creatures
of
all
worlds
to
one
infinite
creator
we
do
not
question
the
truth
of
this
fact
and
those
who
ask
for
proof
must
wait
to
find
it
we
hope
that
this
book
will
be
inspiring
to
every
thoughtful
mind
who
loves
to
learn
more
and
more
of
the
great
system
of
intelligent
life
of
which
the
human
creatures
of
this
world
form
one
link
in
the
chain
if
the
reading
of
this
volume
should
open
to
your
mind
numberless
suggestions
and
compel
you
to
ask
a
host
of
questions
perhaps
you
will
do
as
we
have
done
spend
a
long
time
in
training
your
wings
to
be
swift
enough
to
take
the
journey
yourself
if
you
will
not
do
this
you
must
patiently
wait
until
the
clods
of
clay
are
shaken
off
so
that
your
free
spirit
may
go
out
to
live
the
life
more
vast
in
other
worlds
we
pray
that
the
highest
kind
of
good
may
result
from
the
truths
here
advanced
if
this
shall
be
accomplished
we
shall
have
our
best
reward
for
having
given
this
book

the
printing

truly

author
december
introduction
it
may
seem
like
great
exaggeration
to
say
that
this
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
and
profitable
books
that
has
been
placed
upon
the
american
book
market
for
many
years
follows
no
old
rut
it
has
found
a
new
and
the
reader
is
permitted
to
walk
in
regions
which
he
never
saw
and
of
which
he
never
read
before
it
is
indeed
a
triumph
of
literary
genius
to
give
a
picture
of
intelligent
life
in
other
worlds
upon
a
scientific
and
philosophical
basis
other
writers
have
attempted
to
give
a
description
of
conditions
on
the
moon
mars
or
some
other
single
planet
but
no
one
has
succeeded
in
picturing
the
mysteries
of
life
in
a
number
of
star
worlds
with
such
a
fascination
as
is
here
found
some
one
may
say
that
the
book
is
only
a
work
of
imagination
but
we
challenge
any
one
to
produce
a
book
that
gives
more
timely
thrusts
at
the
evils
of
our
present
day
life
by
showing
how
the
people
of
other
worlds
have
fallen
into
their
sad
conditions
the
author
sounds
a
note
of
warning
to
the
people
of
this
world
and
by
giving
a
glimpse
of
the
manner
in
which
other
worlds
have
reached
their
great
triumphs
he
gives
to
the
people
of
our
world
a
spur
to
loftier
ideals
to
greater
inventions
and
to
a
purer
life
the
publisher
of
this
volume
is
proud
to
put
upon
the
market
a
book
of
such
high
value
and
dignity
it
is
quite
unusual
for
the
subscription
book
market
to
see
such
a
princely
book
come
into
its
midst
here
we
have
ten
dollars
worth
of
packed
into
cream
form
all
for
one
dollar
and
we
positively
assert
that
nothing
like
it
can
be
found
anywhere
in
literature
books
have
no
the
illustrations
are
from
the
masterly
hands
of
an
artist
of
special
merit
for
this
class
of
work
he
happily
places
himself
into
the
midst
of
other
worlds
in
order
to
draw
the
beautiful
pictures
that
illustrate
and
adorn
this
volume
the
illustrations
are
well
worth
careful
examination
and
when
studied
in
connection
with
the
reading
matter
they
are
seen
in
their
greatest
beauty
and
value
illustration
looking
towards
a
thousand
worlds
chapter
i
are
there
more
worlds
than
one
our
world
is
large
enough
to
excite
our
interest
and
invite
our
study
until
we
close
our
eyes
in
death
yet
there
are
countless
other
orbs
scattered
through
the
solar
system
and
throughout
the
vast
stretches
of
the
starry
heavens
some
of
these
worlds
are
smaller
than
ours
but
the
majority
of
them
are
hundreds
or
thousands
of
times
larger
looking
away
from
our
solar
system
we
find
that
each
star
is
a
sun
in
most
instances
the
center
of
a
group
of
worlds
so
for
the
lack
of
a
better
phrase
we
shall
say
that
there
are
millions
of
solar
systems
distributed
through
limitless
space
each
one
serving
its
part
in
the
great
universal
plan
for
what
purpose
are
all
these
immense
worlds
shining
and
swinging
in
the
depths
of
immensity
could
it
be
possible
that
they
are
nothing
more
than
vast
pieces
of
dead
machinery
barren
of
all
vegetable
growth
and
intelligent
life
whereon
desolation
and
solitude
forever
prevail
our
own
earth
is
inhabited
by
a
large
variety
of
living
forms
ranging
from
the
microscopic
bacteria
and
animalcula
to
the
glorious
form
of
man
with
all
his
superior
endowments
the
air
earth
and
water
are
teeming
with
their
billions
of
sensitive
creatures
even
a
breath
of
air
a
drop
of
water
or
a
leaf
on
a
tree
often
contains
a
miniature
world
of
living
forms
amidst
all
this
confusing
animation
around
us
is
it
not
absurd
to
suppose
that
other
worlds
larger
or
smaller
than
our
own
are
barren
of
all
life
and
that
from
them
no
songs
of
thanksgiving
ever
arise
to
the
maker
and
ruler
of
all
things
such
a
supposition
not
only
gives
us
a
strange
view
of
the
character
and
attributes
of
god
but
is
at
once
repulsive
to
our
instincts
anyone
wishing
to
accept
it
may
do
so
but
as
for
me
and
for
a
large
company
of
my
kind
we
prefer
to
give
a
larger
meaning
to
creation
and
a
higher
glory
to
the
creator
let
no
one
doubt
that
the
universe
is
full
of
intelligent
life
in
myriad
types
of
existence
and
infinite
stages
of
development
physically
speaking
one
can
not
imagine
the
countless
variety
of
ways
in
which
flesh
and
bone
may
congregate
around
the
human
brain
to
make
a
sentient
and
intelligent
creature
confined
as
we
are
to
our
little
dark
world
we
know
by
sight
of
only
one
way
in
which
the
brain
conveys
its
messages
and
serves
its
ends
namely
through
a
body
of
one
hundred
pounds
or
more
of
flesh
and
bone
formed
erect
and
capable
of
rendering
service
upon
a
moment
notice
therefore
some
of
us
are
conceited
enough
to
believe
that
we
are
the
most
perfect
and
beautiful
beings
of
the
universe
the
highest
expression
of
creative
art
and
that
all
other
creatures
in
a
million
orbs
take
a
secondary
place
true
enough
we
occupy
an
honored
position
in
the
scale
of
creation
but
while
the
people
of
many
worlds
are
beneath
us
yet
there
are
many
more
planets
whereon
human
genius
has
surpassed
us
and
we
must
be
modest
enough
to
take
our
rightful
place
in
the
drama
of
the
worlds
how
many
planets
how
many
suns
how
many
milky
ways
are
there
you
ask
in
one
breath
speaking
alone
of
our
own
universe
of
which
the
milky
way
is
the
backbone
i
estimate
that
if
we
multiply
the
number
of
stars
by
we
shall
have
the
approximate
number
of
worlds
that
are
large
enough
to
be
classed
with
the
family
of
inhabited
planets
in
our
immediate
universe
there
are
at
least
one
hundred
million
stars
a
number
of
which
have
over
five
hundred
worlds
revolving
around
them
others
have
only
six
or
ten
the
average
as
above
stated
is
estimated
at
then
also
far
out
in
the
depths
of
space
there
are
nebulous
spots
visible
only
through
the
most
searching
lenses
these
are
new
systems
of
milky
ways
or
new
universes
so
immensely
distant
that
our
most
powerful
telescopes
can
not
even
resolve
them
into
stars
there
are
inhabited
worlds
so
far
from
us
that
if
one
could
travel
the
distance
around
our
earth
in
one
second
he
could
proceed
in
one
direction
at
this
rate
of
speed
for
twenty
million
years
and
yet
see
far
ahead
of
him
the
flickering
lights
of
numberless
other
inviting
suns
and
worlds
we
can
not
possibly
grasp
an
idea
of
such
infinite
distances
neither
can
we
form
any
adequate
conception
of
the
long
long
stretches
between
star
and
star
which
is
the
same
as
saying
between
solar
system
and
solar
system
in
our
milky
way
the
stars
seem
to
be
crushed
together
into
a
whitish
jelly
but
the
awful
truth
looms
up
before
us
with
all
sublimity
that
although
these
stars
seem
to
lie
one
upon
another
they
are
millions
and
trillions
of
miles
apart
in
regard
to
our
own
solar
system
much
speculation
is
rife
as
to
the
existence
of
human
creatures
on
the
several
larger
planets
theories
of
all
kinds
have
been
advanced
some
speculative
or
absurd
others
so
plausible
as
to
give
rise
to
interesting
questions
such
as
communicating
with
mars
and
perhaps
of
taking
a
journey
to
the
moon
these
suggestions
while
fanciful
awaken
our
interest
and
excite
our
curiosity
can
any
one
predict
the
excitement
that
would
prevail
in
our
world
if
a
human
creature
from
some
other
planet
were
suddenly
to
set
foot
upon
our
soil
we
would
fling
a
thousand
questions
at
him
to
learn
something
of
the
strange
realm
from
which
he
came
and
how
great
would
be
our
amazement
if
we
were
to
have
the
exalted
privilege
of
journeying
to
other
worlds
seeing
the
types
of
human
creatures
living
there
and
witnessing
a
thousand
other
things
too
strange
and
wonderful
to
mention
i
invite
you
to
listen
as
i
tell
a
condensed
story
of
a
number
of
worlds
which
i
have
visited
all
within
the
boundary
line
of
our
own
universe
i
can
not
even
tell
a
tithe
of
what
i
saw
and
heard
but
must
content
myself
with
giving
a
passing
view
of
a
thousand
worlds
some
of
which
are
situated
in
a
very
distant
corner
of
our
universe
well
you
may
ask
how
could
you
travel
from
world
to
world
and
see
the
various
forms
of
human
life
and
then
remain
alive
to
tell
a
part
of
the
marvelous
tale
if
it
is
a
mystery
to
you
it
is
also
a
mystery
to
me
i
can
not
describe
the
pinions
that
carried
me
nor
tell
whence
came
the
strength
that
moved
my
wings
any
more
than
i
can
explain
by
what
process
i
was
preserved
alive
in
worlds
of
fire
in
worlds
of
ice
and
in
worlds
without
air
but
the
sight
of
all
these
things
was
as
real
to
me
as
the
dreams
of
the
night
and
it
must
be
admitted
that
dreams
are
often
as
realistic
as
the
acts
of
our
wakeful
moments
for
many
years
i
looked
outward
toward
the
starry
firmament
and
at
times
a
deep
yearning
possessed
me
to
speed
away
to
converse
with
the
inhabitants
of
other
spheres
this
hope
i
cherished
so
strongly
that
my
thoughts
completely
overpowered
me
and
ere
i
knew
it
i
was
living
at
the
mercy
of
indescribable
emotions
all
this
continued
during
many
revolutions
of
the
earth
on
its
axis
i
felt
as
columbus
must
have
felt
when
he
was
moving
over
strange
waters
then
occurred
the
most
notable
event
of
my
life
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
i
was
caught
away
from
the
earth
and
without
any
effort
of
my
own
i
was
darting
through
space
faster
than
a
sunbeam
chapter
ii
a
visit
to
the
moon
i
was
not
prepared
for
the
quick
transit
to
our
satellite
nor
for
the
views
thrust
upon
me
so
suddenly
before
i
could
well
collect
my
thoughts
i
found
myself
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
moon
and
strange
as
it
may
seem
i
was
conscious
of
my
surroundings
and
knew
that
i
had
power
to
transport
myself
instantly
to
any
place
i
might
wish
to
go
to
see
the
moon
face
to
face
gives
a
charming
satisfaction
which
can
never
be
realized
two
hundred
and
forty
thousand
miles
away
i
was
conscious
of
my
privilege
and
was
determined
to
take
all
possible
advantage
of
it
now
how
differently
everything
appeared
from
the
views
i
had
snatched
through
the
telescope
while
yet
on
the
earth
i
could
not
see
the
man
in
the
moon
whose
grinning
face
had
so
often
looked
down
upon
me
but
from
my
first
point
of
observation
everything
looked
as
if
life
had
never
existed
there
and
consequently
i
was
about
to
conclude
that
no
human
beings
inhabit
the
moon
this
theory
soon
vanished
for
after
i
had
traveled
over
a
hundred
miles
i
came
to
a
thriving
center
of
population
the
largest
city
on
the
sphere
inhabited
by
more
than
sixty
thousand
rational
beings
these
creatures
resemble
us
most
strongly
in
their
mental
capacities
though
their
bodies
are
out
of
harmony
with
ours
having
three
eyes
and
no
nose
the
third
eye
is
situated
in
the
center
of
the
forehead
and
the
other
two
more
toward
the
sides
of
the
head
life
is
not
sustained
by
breathing
a
gaseous
air
as
we
do
so
that
the
sense
of
smell
is
performed
by
the
protruded
upper
lip
at
the
voluntary
effort
to
catch
scent
the
upper
lip
noticeably
rolls
upward
into
a
partial
scroll
i
was
anxious
to
learn
how
the
life
of
these
moonites
is
sustained
without
breathing
and
to
my
astonishment
i
learned
that
they
eat
solid
air
at
intervals
of
about
six
hours
this
is
not
taken
in
connection
with
the
regular
food
but
is
eaten
alone
and
carried
into
a
separate
stomach
wherein
it
is
disintegrated
by
the
chemical
action
of
the
stomachic
acids
the
gases
thus
formed
serve
the
same
purpose
as
the
air
we
breathe
into
our
lungs
according
to
the
conjectures
of
some
earthly
astronomers
i
was
expecting
to
see
a
race
of
immense
giants
on
the
contrary
i
found
that
these
moonites
grow
to
only
about
our
height
but
possess
fully
as
much
circumference
of
body
notwithstanding
that
they
are
so
short
and
rotund
they
are
healthy
and
exceedingly
quick
in
all
their
bodily
movements
no
doubt
i
shall
be
chided
for
saying
that
these
are
a
handsome
people
but
i
was
enabled
to
judge
them
by
a
universal
standard
of
beauty
and
i
looked
upon
them
as
a
product
of
the
same
infinite
creator
who
fashioned
our
mortal
bodies
with
such
marvelous
adaptation
of
means
to
end
one
thing
is
sure
were
a
person
from
the
moon
to
set
foot
upon
our
planet
he
would
estimate
us
to
be
as
far
out
of
harmony
with
his
standards
of
beauty
as
we
should
consider
him
to
be
out
of
harmony
with
ours
as
might
be
expected
these
people
are
very
peculiar
in
their
habits
there
is
a
small
percentage
of
the
population
who
are
bright
stars
intellectually
while
others
are
extremely
indolent
when
a
person
wins
a
record
for
laziness
it
is
said
of
him
he
is
too
lazy
to
eat
his
air
the
large
city
to
which
i
had
come
was
indeed
a
novel
sight
its
buildings
average
in
height
of
ours
although
they
occupy
nearly
as
much
ground
space
they
are
composed
almost
totally
of
materials
the
window
panes
are
not
made
of
a
brittle
substance
like
glass
but
resemble
mica
except
that
they
are
more
tough
and
durable
these
moonites
are
wiser
than
we
in
roofing
their
houses
they
have
discovered
a
mineral
composition
which
in
its
plastic
state
is
daubed
over
the
roof
this
upon
hardening
is
proof
against
all
conditions
of
weather
and
never
needs
replacing
there
are
many
striking
features
in
their
architecture
in
general
it
may
be
said
that
they
are
quite
far
advanced
in
constructive
ability
some
of
their
larger
buildings
look
like
soldiers
forts
others
resemble
immense
bee
hives
while
still
others
appear
like
synagogues
we
are
their
superiors
in
almost
every
line
especially
in
our
knowledge
and
use
of
electricity
and
photography
and
also
in
our
manufacturing
and
scientific
skill
however
they
have
decidedly
surpassed
us
in
imitative
and
creative
art
their
paintings
express
so
accurately
the
emotions
of
the
heart
that
i
found
myself
in
tears
as
i
saw
their
masterpieces
for
a
time
i
forgot
that
i
was
on
the
moon
so
lost
was
i
in
elevated
reflections
all
suggested
by
their
art
creations
how
i
wished
that
i
could
have
taken
some
of
these
specimens
with
me
from
the
moon
our
earth
looks
like
a
large
hanging
in
the
heavens
it
is
amusing
to
learn
of
the
various
opinions
and
superstitions
that
are
held
regarding
this
world
some
of
the
moonites
declare
that
it
is
a
huge
lantern
hung
solely
for
their
benefit
and
scoff
at
the
idea
that
it
might
be
a
world
inhabited
by
civilized
beings
more
intelligent
moonites
venture
the
theory
that
human
life
could
exist
on
the
great
but
declare
that
this
is
quite
improbable
as
the
whole
planet
is
enveloped
by
some
thick
smoky
substance
in
which
they
believe
it
would
be
impossible
for
human
life
to
exist
some
look
upon
the
earth
as
the
mother
of
the
moon
and
regard
the
sun
as
the
father
this
sex
idea
runs
through
most
of
their
heathen
religion
and
there
are
more
who
worship
the
earth
and
the
sun
than
there
are
who
worship
the
god
who
created
these
heavenly
bodies
i
prolonged
my
investigations
without
becoming
visible
taking
note
of
numberless
facts
of
interest
which
will
ever
be
a
source
of
pleasure
and
value
to
me
at
length
however
i
concluded
to
take
advantage
of
a
privilege
and
power
i
possessed
and
becoming
visible
i
entered
a
quiet
room
in
the
presence
of
a
very
distinguished
man
he
was
by
far
the
most
highly
educated
person
on
the
moon
i
was
more
surprised
than
he
for
i
expected
that
he
would
be
greatly
agitated
at
my
unaccountable
appearance
imagine
my
surprise
when
he
sat
motionless
gazing
firmly
into
my
face
which
to
him
was
out
of
harmony
with
all
ideas
of
correct
form
i
was
the
first
to
speak
and
although
he
had
manifested
outwardly
such
self
possession
i
soon
learned
that
it
was
a
mere
show
of
stoicism
in
the
presence
of
one
whom
he
thought
to
be
a
spirit
in
an
incredibly
short
time
we
were
on
easy
speaking
terms
and
i
was
gaining
the
object
of
my
visit
among
the
many
things
of
interest
that
i
learned
from
this
famous
character
were
facts
concerning
the
history
of
the
moon
according
to
the
information
he
gave
me
i
figured
that
human
life
had
existed
on
the
moon
thousands
of
years
before
its
appearance
on
the
earth
scientifically
i
could
not
account
for
this
on
any
other
ground
than
that
the
moon
being
a
much
smaller
orb
cooled
off
sufficiently
to
sustain
life
on
its
surface
long
before
any
form
of
life
could
exist
on
our
earth
the
moonities
of
the
old
era
were
a
prosperous
and
progressive
people
far
outshining
their
successors
who
now
occupy
the
sphere
after
making
history
for
several
thousand
years
the
human
race
had
grown
to
one
hundred
million
in
numbers
and
civilization
had
reached
a
surprising
degree
of
perfection
in
those
ages
the
moon
was
a
much
more
fertile
garden
than
now
luxury
and
refinement
were
enjoyed
by
the
favored
sons
of
that
period
and
no
one
dreamed
of
the
horrible
fate
that
was
to
sweep
practically
the
whole
race
into
the
regions
of
death
my
intelligent
informer
used
excessive
language
in
trying
to
picture
the
unequaled
catastrophe
that
put
an
end
to
the
old
era
my
interest
was
unbounded
and
with
awed
breath
i
continued
listening
as
he
described
the
cause
of
this
great
and
terrible
cataclysm
it
all
occurred
about
five
thousand
years
ago
he
said
the
moon
was
shaken
by
subterraneous
rumblings
followed
by
fiery
ejections
covering
a
period
of
nearly
one
and
revolutions
whole
cities
were
ruined
fertile
valleys
covered
and
human
life
was
almost
annihilated
i
knew
what
my
informant
meant
by
one
and
revolutions
this
would
be
a
period
of
about
forty
days
and
nights
of
earthly
time
do
you
wonder
that
my
mind
flew
back
to
the
forty
days
and
nights
of
rain
that
destroyed
at
one
time
on
our
earth
the
whole
human
family
except
the
few
who
were
saved
in
the
ark
what
are
the
evidences
of
this
horrible
i
asked
they
are
on
every
hand
have
you
not
yet
seen
the
vast
craters
the
mountains
of
barren
cinder
the
stumps
of
immense
pillars
partly
excavated
all
this
and
very
much
more
silently
unfolds
a
tale
of
horror
that
can
be
faintly
pictured
only
by
the
imagination
think
of
a
holocaust
so
terrible
that
one
hundred
million
human
creatures
are
thereby
swept
into
death
in
the
narrow
compass
of
forty
days
the
records
that
have
been
brought
down
to
us
by
the
few
survivors
indicate
the
continual
wails
of
horror
rending
the
sky
while
the
volcanic
disturbances
continued
thousands
and
millions
ran
from
place
to
place
to
find
shelter
from
the
storm
of
fire
at
one
place
the
surface
would
open
and
at
another
the
lava
would
run
fate
with
a
merciless
hand
was
dragging
each
one
into
one
or
another
of
the
inevitable
pits
how
many
were
saved
i
asked
with
deepening
interest
parts
of
only
eight
families
aggregating
nineteen
human
beings
and
how
many
people
are
on
the
moon
now
almost
forty
million
how
do
you
account
for
this
slow
growth
i
asked
after
i
had
explained
that
on
our
globe
a
much
larger
number
of
inhabitants
sprang
from
a
smaller
number
than
nineteen
in
a
shorter
period
of
time
this
allusion
cost
me
much
explanation
and
after
i
had
selfishly
brushed
his
rising
questions
aside
i
learned
that
large
companies
of
the
moonites
had
been
swept
into
death
by
frequent
volcanic
outbursts
all
along
the
line
of
the
centuries
no
one
can
estimate
my
interest
as
i
continued
the
conversation
but
finally
i
decided
to
stroll
through
certain
parts
of
the
city
and
thinking
it
advisable
to
give
no
notice
of
my
departure
i
suddenly
vanished
from
his
sight
however
before
leaving
the
room
i
observed
that
my
bewildered
auditor
conjectured
for
a
long
time
and
reached
his
former
conclusion
that
he
had
been
in
touch
with
an
apparition
again
i
resumed
my
visible
form
and
walked
along
one
of
the
principal
streets
of
the
city
what
novel
sights
greeted
my
eyes
on
every
side
one
can
not
well
imagine
what
excitement
i
aroused
citizens
who
first
saw
me
lifted
their
flabby
arms
in
terror
and
ran
to
the
city
bizen
a
place
where
every
inhabitant
under
oath
is
obliged
to
carry
special
news
before
communicating
it
elsewhere
illustration
visiting
a
city
on
the
moon
in
a
very
short
time
the
city
plins
or
in
our
language
city
authorities
were
coming
toward
me
in
their
costly
vehicles
they
were
preceded
however
by
what
we
would
call
a
body
guard
imagine
their
surprise
to
hear
me
shout
at
the
top
of
my
voice
which
sounded
to
them
as
thunder
would
to
us
you
need
not
fear
i
will
do
you
no
harm
my
voice
had
a
magical
effect
on
the
assembling
host
of
pigmies
they
looked
at
me
with
as
much
curiosity
as
i
looked
at
them
i
stepped
over
their
heads
but
was
careful
not
to
trample
on
the
children
who
scampered
at
my
approach
if
one
could
ship
a
car
load
of
these
children
to
the
earth
they
would
make
excellent
dolls
for
they
range
in
size
from
only
six
to
ten
inches
finally
i
sat
on
the
roof
of
one
of
their
lower
buildings
to
watch
the
gathering
of
the
multitudes
and
study
their
curious
countenances
some
of
the
more
educated
seeing
that
i
was
peacefully
inclined
ventured
close
to
my
knees
and
then
looked
the
more
intently
into
my
face
all
of
which
was
agreeable
as
it
enabled
me
to
get
a
still
closer
view
of
their
faces
i
saw
that
the
whole
city
was
turning
out
and
i
wondered
how
the
alarm
could
have
been
given
so
speedily
upon
inquiry
a
fine
artist
at
my
side
tremblingly
explained
that
the
bizen
wires
had
been
touched
for
block
six
this
meant
that
every
house
in
the
city
had
received
notice
of
an
unusual
occurrence
in
that
section
i
resolved
to
learn
more
of
this
system
and
how
it
was
operated
without
the
aid
of
electricity
now
i
was
besieged
by
a
pressing
host
at
once
i
commenced
to
speak
in
moon
dialect
i
told
them
whence
i
came
pointing
to
the
large
that
hung
in
their
heavens
after
a
short
discourse
i
invited
questions
one
of
their
leaders
stepped
nearer
to
me
and
acted
as
the
spokesman
of
the
crowd
his
language
and
voice
were
of
excellent
quality
and
although
visibly
agitated
he
bore
himself
with
commendable
dignity
let
me
here
translate
our
conversation
into
english
how
came
you
here
asked
he
that
i
can
not
explain
did
you
walk
or
run
i
did
neither
surrendering
this
line
of
inquiry
he
went
on
to
ask
the
following
questions
are
there
more
creatures
than
you
where
you
came
from
large
cities
full
of
them
are
they
smaller
than
you
their
average
height
equals
mine
it
must
be
a
ponderous
world
of
immense
giants
beyond
the
comprehension
of
any
inhabitant
of
our
whole
globe
but
just
as
i
appear
large
to
you
you
appear
unnaturally
small
to
me
i
calmly
added
how
came
that
lump
in
the
middle
of
your
face
i
knew
the
questioner
referred
to
my
nose
i
took
a
good
wholesome
laugh
and
the
large
concourse
of
people
watched
my
wrinkling
face
with
strange
delight
the
moonites
express
all
their
emotions
by
exclamations
and
almost
infinite
variations
of
the
lower
lip
in
conjunction
with
their
three
eyes
i
told
the
spokesman
that
the
lump
on
my
face
was
called
nose
using
our
pronunciation
and
that
it
grew
there
by
nature
and
not
by
accident
i
also
informed
him
that
each
person
in
our
world
had
such
a
nose
at
which
much
merriment
ensued
lips
twitched
and
quivered
as
their
eyes
blinked
and
rolled
it
seemed
to
me
like
a
hideous
way
to
laugh
but
no
doubt
my
nose
seemed
just
as
hideous
to
them
then
i
explained
all
about
our
dense
atmosphere
the
part
that
air
played
in
our
life
and
what
a
fine
convenience
the
nose
is
during
eating
and
speaking
of
course
all
this
was
unintelligible
to
them
i
then
busied
myself
in
ascertaining
the
secret
of
their
signal
system
i
learned
much
to
my
surprise
that
with
scarcely
any
knowledge
of
electricity
the
moonites
had
long
ago
discovered
a
means
of
communication
which
is
somewhat
similar
to
our
wireless
telegraphy
from
central
stations
messages
are
transmitted
to
sensitive
metal
rods
set
up
on
each
somewhat
like
the
lightning
rods
that
decorate
on
my
own
earth
i
also
learned
that
a
very
thin
atmosphere
is
prevalent
on
the
moon
and
that
this
rare
medium
is
more
suited
to
their
wireless
telegraphy
than
our
heavier
atmosphere
would
be
with
its
different
composition
i
soon
learned
that
great
excitement
was
prevailing
throughout
the
adjacent
villages
wireless
telegraphy
carried
the
news
and
from
all
directions
throngs
were
pressing
toward
the
city
furthermore
i
saw
that
the
noted
personage
with
whom
i
had
spent
a
quiet
season
was
now
making
his
way
toward
me
not
wishing
to
hold
further
conversation
with
him
and
desiring
to
escape
the
tide
of
curious
questioners
i
once
more
became
invisible
and
proceeded
to
study
the
physical
phenomena
of
the
moon
i
now
saw
that
everything
bore
evidence
to
the
fearful
havoc
of
volcanic
eruptions
that
had
laid
waste
so
large
a
portion
of
the
moon
surface
the
people
live
in
the
remaining
fertile
belts
and
patches
of
land
which
are
fortunately
scattered
in
rich
profusion
over
the
greater
portion
of
the
surface
reminding
one
of
productive
oases
in
the
deserts
of
our
world
here
and
there
in
stately
museums
are
stored
the
relics
of
the
old
glorious
civilization
at
a
few
of
these
places
i
tarried
to
study
the
achievements
of
a
people
who
flourished
five
thousand
years
ago
at
a
time
when
the
civilization
of
our
world
was
yet
young
what
an
interest
lay
wrapped
up
in
the
relics
naturally
i
thought
of
pompeii
as
i
was
viewing
the
antique
treasures
that
had
been
brought
to
light
from
their
old
graves
of
ashes
cinder
and
lava
in
some
of
these
specimens
i
saw
glimpses
of
inventions
that
have
never
been
reproduced
on
the
moon
and
never
known
on
our
earth
onward
i
moved
to
take
my
last
views
of
the
moon
for
ragged
and
jagged
cliffs
of
almost
total
barrenness
and
yawning
chasms
lined
with
intolerable
precipices
the
moon
outrivals
the
earth
i
took
a
passing
glimpse
of
the
famous
called
by
our
astronomers
copernicus
and
theophilus
the
former
situated
in
the
eastern
and
the
latter
in
the
western
hemisphere
of
the
moon
the
largest
openings
of
our
earth
dwindle
into
insignificance
compared
with
such
stupendous
marvels
of
natural
scenery
many
similar
places
i
visited
but
i
spent
my
last
hours
on
the
moon
in
the
presence
of
that
gigantic
chasm
called
newton
where
i
was
thrilled
with
feelings
of
sublimity
as
never
before
outstretched
lay
the
immense
opening
nearly
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
long
and
about
seventy
miles
broad
it
was
fearful
to
gaze
into
it
for
my
eye
stretched
downward
mile
after
mile
until
it
reached
the
blackness
of
darkness
it
frequently
happens
that
a
moonite
accidentally
falls
into
this
monster
newtonian
chasm
nothing
more
is
ever
seen
or
heard
of
him
i
shuddered
as
i
peered
into
this
gigantic
opening
whose
gaping
mouth
could
swallow
pike
peak
so
that
its
highest
point
would
be
many
thousands
of
feet
below
the
surface
we
have
nothing
on
our
earth
that
can
compare
with
this
terribly
imposing
sight
and
as
i
was
studying
the
expansive
waste
i
could
more
readily
understand
how
large
numbers
of
human
beings
could
be
destroyed
by
such
fabulous
quantities
of
boiling
lava
as
were
capable
of
being
thrown
from
this
pit
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
lava
and
ashes
hurled
from
this
crater
alone
would
send
a
withering
blast
of
for
many
hundreds
of
miles
around
if
you
have
never
been
privileged
to
look
upon
this
ponderous
chasm
face
to
face
improve
your
first
opportunity
to
get
a
glimpse
of
it
through
as
powerful
a
telescope
as
possible
chapter
iii
a
visit
to
mars
i
need
not
describe
the
manner
of
my
flight
it
is
enough
to
say
that
to
my
delight
i
reached
our
neighbor
planet
called
mars
and
at
once
proceeded
to
study
its
physical
features
and
its
human
life
everything
was
vastly
different
from
what
i
had
been
long
accustomed
to
see
and
to
imagine
and
i
felt
quite
assured
that
i
was
living
in
a
dream
but
i
knew
of
no
way
to
convince
myself
as
to
my
bearings
so
i
concluded
to
make
the
best
use
of
my
time
and
opportunities
and
leave
questionings
to
the
future
as
a
physical
world
mars
bears
a
most
striking
resemblance
to
our
earth
the
length
of
its
year
is
six
hundred
and
of
our
days
and
the
length
of
its
day
is
hours
and
minutes
its
diameter
is
about
that
of
the
earth
and
its
distance
from
the
sun
is
miles
even
from
our
own
world
we
can
discern
through
a
good
telescope
the
changing
colors
of
the
planet
due
to
the
recurring
seasons
each
one
of
which
is
almost
twice
the
length
of
ours
there
is
relatively
much
less
water
on
mars
than
is
found
on
our
earth
and
gravity
on
its
surface
is
only
per
cent
of
terrestrial
gravity
imagine
then
how
light
everything
must
be
this
may
account
somewhat
for
the
physical
proportions
of
its
inhabitants
for
they
are
over
twice
our
size
and
in
appearance
resemble
us
but
little
they
have
four
arms
two
extra
ones
extending
from
a
point
just
above
the
knees
the
two
lower
arms
act
as
servants
to
the
two
higher
thus
are
the
four
used
at
one
time
in
harmony
mars
is
an
older
world
than
ours
and
although
it
receives
only
as
much
heat
from
the
sun
yet
it
is
almost
of
the
same
temperature
owing
to
a
peculiar
condition
of
the
atmosphere
which
we
would
call
heat
retentivity
some
scientists
and
philosophers
will
at
once
say
that
such
atmospheric
conditions
are
contrary
to
reason
and
natural
law
but
they
must
be
informed
that
on
mars
there
are
chemical
elements
and
affinities
not
known
in
our
world
it
requires
but
little
change
in
the
elementary
construction
of
the
atmosphere
to
render
it
capable
of
strong
properties
standing
on
the
surface
of
this
planet
my
attention
was
easily
attracted
by
the
two
frisky
moons
called
deimos
and
phobos
at
the
small
distance
of
and
miles
respectively
these
two
moons
are
constantly
flying
around
the
planet
one
in
about
thirty
hours
and
the
other
in
seven
and
hours
the
astronomers
of
mars
have
discovered
unmistakable
signs
of
human
life
on
the
farthest
of
these
two
moons
they
are
hoping
to
be
able
some
day
to
cover
the
intervening
distance
and
for
the
first
time
see
their
old
neighbors
face
to
face
before
i
had
traveled
over
the
surface
of
this
planet
i
was
thoroughly
convinced
that
it
was
a
rough
jagged
world
without
lofty
mountain
ranges
or
peaks
the
many
long
and
narrow
fertile
valleys
much
resembling
the
canons
of
our
own
earth
absorbed
my
mind
with
more
than
passing
interest
looking
carefully
into
one
of
these
canon
depressions
i
saw
a
class
of
human
beings
in
a
low
state
of
civilization
nevertheless
they
were
expert
in
agriculture
and
seemed
to
labor
contentedly
with
a
dull
plodding
vigor
beyond
all
reason
according
to
appearances
there
seemed
to
be
no
social
relation
or
connection
between
the
inhabitants
of
one
valley
and
those
of
another
at
first
i
was
greatly
puzzled
at
these
peculiar
conditions
next
i
gave
my
attention
to
the
highlands
or
wide
barren
ridges
between
the
valleys
on
these
elevations
i
saw
a
highly
civilized
race
of
people
living
in
great
splendor
they
enjoyed
the
privilege
of
traveling
from
one
highland
to
another
and
of
exchanging
courtesies
their
interests
were
common
and
their
joys
and
sorrows
were
mutual
at
once
i
became
interested
in
these
extremes
of
life
as
exhibited
in
the
valleys
and
on
the
highlands
and
resolved
that
i
would
find
the
cause
for
these
differences
the
authentic
history
of
these
marsmen
runs
back
through
thousands
of
years
i
learned
with
interest
the
wonderful
past
life
on
this
world
there
was
once
a
time
when
people
all
mingled
together
and
cultivated
the
valleys
each
one
by
doing
his
part
made
it
lighter
for
all
but
after
many
years
a
few
schemers
combined
and
by
their
inventive
genius
succeeded
in
erecting
vast
sliding
curtains
over
the
valleys
these
curtains
were
supported
from
the
tops
of
the
ridges
on
each
side
and
by
their
manipulation
the
operators
could
keep
the
sunlight
from
any
particular
part
of
the
valley
then
these
shrewd
marsmen
exacted
tribute
from
the
saying
to
them
give
us
a
fifth
part
of
your
products
and
we
will
give
you
sunlight
so
the
toilers
gave
them
tribute
willingly
knowing
that
they
could
not
live
without
sunlight
then
it
came
to
pass
that
these
toilers
were
burdened
by
reason
of
their
taxes
and
they
prayed
to
the
rich
that
they
might
have
sunlight
at
a
lower
price
but
the
rich
replied
we
can
not
give
you
sunlight
for
less
because
it
costs
us
much
to
keep
in
repair
our
immense
curtain
systems
across
the
valley
so
the
poor
toilers
labored
more
and
slept
less
while
the
few
rich
on
the
elevations
built
unto
themselves
more
spacious
homes
and
lived
in
greater
luxury
all
their
days
in
process
of
time
some
of
the
shrewdest
highlanders
devised
an
attachment
to
the
curtain
system
by
which
the
rainfall
could
also
be
distributed
at
the
will
of
the
operators
then
the
rich
marsmen
on
the
elevations
said
to
the
toilers
give
us
more
of
your
products
and
we
will
give
you
your
share
of
the
rainfall
the
poor
laborers
had
no
alternative
so
they
labored
still
more
diligently
to
pay
their
taxes
for
light
and
rain
and
the
burden
became
so
heavy
that
they
could
no
longer
bear
it
so
they
sent
up
a
petition
praying
for
sunlight
and
rain
for
a
instead
of
a
tribute
the
rich
refused
to
listen
to
this
prayer
whereat
the
toilers
refused
to
comply
with
these
intolerable
demands
then
did
the
rich
magnates
of
the
elevations
draw
their
curtains
to
keep
both
sunshine
and
rain
from
the
valley
the
laborers
consumed
all
they
had
until
in
desperation
they
asked
again
for
sunlight
and
rain
but
the
rich
refused
to
give
either
unless
the
toilers
would
promise
to
give
a
tribute
to
do
this
the
toilers
at
length
agreed
then
the
curtains
were
withdrawn
the
sunlight
once
more
kissed
the
valley
the
rain
again
fell
upon
the
fields
and
some
of
the
poor
ignorant
people
devoutly
thanked
their
god
for
these
gifts
illustration
monopolizing
light
and
rain
on
mars
it
occurred
later
that
one
of
the
many
toilers
whom
his
creator
had
endowed
with
unusual
wisdom
became
the
leader
of
the
masses
in
struggling
for
their
rights
he
traveled
the
whole
length
of
the
valley
and
advocated
that
the
people
should
unite
march
to
the
summit
of
the
hill
destroy
the
fastenings
that
held
these
curtains
and
as
the
coverings
would
fall
destroy
them
with
fire
this
leader
declared
that
they
were
entitled
to
sunlight
and
rain
without
paying
tribute
to
man
gradually
the
workers
were
won
to
his
views
the
rich
seeing
that
their
investments
were
threatened
hired
a
few
brilliant
orators
and
sent
them
to
the
people
to
persuade
them
not
to
give
heed
to
a
man
of
one
idea
these
orators
argued
that
it
would
be
a
great
crime
to
destroy
the
property
of
others
and
that
their
only
way
of
securing
happiness
was
to
toil
on
with
patience
and
keep
looking
for
brighter
days
the
people
listened
to
the
specious
sophistries
and
thus
pushed
aside
their
redeemer
putting
off
forever
the
day
of
their
deliverance
similar
troubles
continued
to
arise
in
the
valley
but
the
rich
always
succeeded
in
quieting
the
people
before
they
rose
to
determined
action
then
the
rich
decided
to
put
an
end
to
these
agitations
among
the
toilers
accordingly
they
cut
off
all
communication
from
valley
to
valley
either
by
epistle
or
person
and
refused
longer
to
permit
any
poor
toiler
or
his
children
to
pursue
any
study
whatever
by
this
method
in
the
course
of
a
few
hundred
years
the
valley
dwellers
lapsed
into
ignorant
slaves
not
knowing
except
by
tradition
that
there
were
other
people
in
other
parts
of
mars
thus
the
rich
continued
to
flourish
on
all
the
highlands
for
they
had
extended
this
same
policy
until
the
toilers
of
the
whole
planet
were
practically
galley
slaves
each
consigned
to
his
own
narrow
canon
after
witnessing
the
wide
extent
of
this
slavery
system
i
appeared
in
visible
form
to
a
rich
dignitary
on
one
of
the
most
refined
highlands
he
was
alone
and
upon
raising
his
eyes
and
seeing
me
before
him
he
was
greatly
amazed
to
see
a
little
man
with
a
hairy
face
and
with
the
kind
of
clothing
i
wore
was
all
too
odd
for
him
to
take
in
at
once
he
acted
as
if
i
were
some
animal
but
when
i
addressed
him
in
his
own
tongue
and
manifested
a
becomingly
meek
disposition
he
accepted
me
as
a
deformed
creature
afflicted
with
a
mild
form
of
lunacy
then
he
proceeded
to
examine
my
clothing
and
especially
my
knees
trying
to
solve
by
what
freak
of
nature
i
was
cursed
since
i
had
no
lower
arms
such
as
he
had
my
small
face
smooth
forehead
and
the
short
straight
hair
on
my
head
aroused
in
him
no
little
wonder
and
merriment
so
that
all
in
all
i
was
the
oddest
freak
he
had
ever
seen
he
soon
showed
by
his
manner
how
thankful
he
was
that
gracious
nature
had
formed
him
so
much
more
kindly
than
me
his
questions
soon
poured
out
upon
me
and
i
answered
as
briefly
and
intelligently
as
i
could
he
pressed
me
so
hard
as
to
the
place
of
my
birth
that
i
finally
informed
him
that
i
came
from
another
world
whereat
he
was
assured
of
my
insanity
and
proceeded
to
fasten
me
by
force
until
he
might
summon
certain
of
his
friends
knowing
that
all
the
people
of
mars
could
do
me
no
ultimate
harm
and
wishing
to
see
what
might
be
their
intentions
i
offered
very
feeble
resistance
to
his
course
in
a
very
short
time
there
was
grouped
around
me
a
curious
set
of
people
all
of
whom
seemed
to
me
so
horribly
ugly
that
i
felt
well
satisfied
that
i
had
been
born
on
the
earth
among
the
company
were
some
eminent
scholars
who
did
no
more
than
peer
at
one
another
and
walk
about
me
while
they
were
waiting
for
some
learned
professors
to
arrive
from
a
distance
a
long
tedious
period
ensued
ere
the
company
of
judges
or
examiners
were
gathered
from
several
adjoining
highlands
they
took
me
into
a
large
room
where
followed
an
indescribable
examination
during
which
i
purposely
remained
silent
the
button
and
button
holes
of
my
clothing
attracted
as
much
attention
as
my
unnaturally
shaped
head
my
collar
and
necktie
were
conundrums
not
one
of
the
learned
scholars
was
able
to
advance
a
theory
as
to
the
probable
use
of
such
a
stiff
piece
under
my
head
i
could
not
conceal
my
smiles
as
i
heard
the
flying
theories
as
to
the
use
of
my
cuffs
one
specialist
decided
that
inasmuch
as
i
had
only
two
arms
i
wore
these
to
make
them
appear
larger
this
was
accepted
as
the
most
plausible
explanation
several
times
they
urged
me
to
speak
the
man
to
whom
i
had
first
appeared
had
told
them
that
i
was
expert
in
their
language
but
i
would
not
utter
a
word
being
anxious
to
learn
all
i
could
by
listening
to
their
conjectures
some
of
my
examiners
were
sure
i
belonged
to
a
species
of
their
animal
creation
who
in
some
unaccountable
manner
had
received
the
gift
of
intelligence
but
this
opinion
did
not
gain
ground
as
no
one
could
account
for
the
manner
of
my
clothing
and
especially
for
my
pocket
knife
and
other
accompaniments
no
one
believed
that
i
came
from
another
world
and
yet
no
one
could
see
how
or
where
i
had
originated
on
mars
finally
one
of
the
company
struck
upon
a
popular
theory
he
argued
that
i
belonged
to
a
tribe
of
creatures
that
had
developed
far
away
in
one
of
their
almost
unending
forests
and
that
i
was
the
first
of
my
kind
that
had
ever
ventured
so
far
from
home
but
how
did
he
learn
our
language
queried
one
any
intelligent
creature
would
by
nature
alone
come
to
our
language
was
the
conceited
explanation
of
another
another
gave
a
better
theory
which
was
at
length
accepted
he
said
that
no
doubt
i
belonged
to
a
company
that
had
emigrated
long
long
ago
from
one
of
the
valleys
after
all
their
pains
i
satisfied
their
ruling
desire
by
speaking
they
knew
not
what
to
say
as
i
gave
them
a
general
description
of
the
world
from
which
i
came
purposely
i
used
their
most
cultured
forms
of
expression
at
once
i
rose
to
a
high
level
in
their
estimation
and
they
gradually
accepted
my
words
as
true
with
absorbing
interest
they
listened
to
every
syllable
and
when
i
paused
their
questions
fell
upon
me
in
wild
profusion
on
my
account
the
schools
were
abandoned
all
the
leading
teachers
of
five
elevations
became
my
astonished
auditors
and
after
every
period
of
sleep
i
was
confronted
by
still
other
classes
of
specialists
some
from
more
distant
elevations
finally
feigning
ignorance
i
asked
where
they
obtained
their
sustenance
as
i
had
not
seen
one
field
in
cultivation
they
told
me
the
whole
history
of
the
toilers
in
the
valley
as
already
recounted
and
how
the
curtain
magnates
received
their
tributes
which
were
sufficient
to
feed
all
the
people
of
the
elevations
what
right
i
asked
has
any
one
to
form
a
monopoly
on
sunlight
or
rain
which
are
free
bounties
from
above
there
can
be
nothing
wrong
about
that
came
the
positive
answer
any
man
who
was
wise
enough
to
think
of
such
a
splendid
system
of
surely
deserves
all
the
benefit
that
can
be
secured
from
it
how
did
you
succeed
in
getting
the
people
to
submit
to
such
a
system
it
all
came
by
force
at
first
they
were
unwilling
enough
but
we
withdrew
their
education
and
kept
them
isolated
with
ignorance
you
can
conquer
any
people
now
they
are
our
perfect
servants
and
in
a
short
time
we
need
not
use
the
curtains
any
more
a
few
masters
can
control
the
whole
valley
all
we
need
to
give
them
will
be
enough
to
eat
and
the
remainder
of
their
products
we
can
send
to
the
elevations
i
was
struck
with
horror
at
this
revolting
scheme
and
expressed
myself
in
strong
terms
i
thought
of
the
conditions
of
our
world
and
felt
thankful
that
it
had
not
gone
so
far
that
the
laboring
classes
were
galley
slaves
to
the
rich
and
i
breathed
my
prayer
that
it
might
never
be
so
my
investigations
on
this
planet
were
long
extended
the
educated
people
gave
me
many
new
ideas
although
they
are
ignorant
of
many
advantages
which
we
enjoy
their
means
of
transportation
are
miserable
compared
with
ours
and
when
i
was
explaining
to
the
marsmen
our
methods
of
travel
they
were
surprised
beyond
measure
however
their
knowledge
of
nature
and
forms
of
animal
life
is
far
superior
to
ours
there
i
solved
some
of
the
complex
questions
of
biology
which
had
long
puzzled
my
mind
during
my
stay
on
the
earth
in
their
religion
they
worship
the
source
of
life
and
look
upon
the
sun
as
the
place
to
which
the
spirit
goes
at
death
in
brief
the
sun
is
their
heaven
they
believe
that
the
sun
heat
will
be
no
barrier
to
the
spirit
complete
happiness
when
liberated
from
the
body
phonetically
pronounced
they
call
the
sun
i
was
indeed
surprised
at
the
simplicity
of
their
devotions
to
their
unseen
god
even
the
untutored
toilers
of
the
valleys
talk
to
the
source
of
life
and
are
constantly
looking
forward
to
the
time
when
their
hard
lot
will
be
over
that
they
may
enter
the
life
i
could
not
help
but
think
that
their
chances
of
heaven
were
better
than
those
of
the
highland
caste
but
i
will
not
judge
lest
i
might
err
who
can
understand
the
universal
plans
of
jehovah
before
i
left
the
marsmen
i
informed
them
that
certain
enthusiasts
of
my
world
had
been
signaling
to
them
for
some
time
and
urged
them
to
improve
their
astronomical
apparatus
so
that
they
might
be
able
to
discern
these
signals
and
reply
to
them
on
account
of
my
thoughtlessness
i
made
an
error
for
i
failed
while
i
was
yet
on
mars
to
arrange
a
code
of
signals
hence
i
fear
that
there
will
be
considerable
experimenting
before
we
can
hope
to
establish
communication
with
our
neighbor
world
chapter
iv
a
glimpse
of
jupiter
the
next
world
i
visited
was
jupiter
the
greatest
orb
in
the
solar
system
almost
fourteen
hundred
times
as
large
as
our
earth
i
found
it
whirling
on
its
axis
so
rapidly
that
it
makes
an
entire
revolution
in
about
ten
hours
of
our
time
this
voluminous
sphere
is
in
great
contrast
to
both
the
moon
and
mars
its
physical
constituency
resembles
a
liquid
more
than
a
solid
and
it
is
quite
hot
but
not
luminous
it
has
cooled
sufficiently
to
admit
human
forms
although
certain
parts
of
the
giant
planet
are
void
of
all
life
owing
to
the
more
intense
heat
in
those
sections
the
atmosphere
is
charged
with
thick
clouds
never
at
rest
and
continually
forming
into
immense
scrolls
close
to
the
surface
of
the
planet
the
human
life
of
jupiter
is
found
in
certain
belts
where
the
crust
of
the
planet
has
been
hardened
for
several
thousand
years
the
people
have
risen
from
rude
primitive
conditions
to
a
state
of
splendid
civilization
in
size
they
are
colossal
giants
averaging
feet
in
height
their
two
powerful
arms
extend
from
what
we
would
call
the
hips
and
no
one
would
imagine
with
what
facility
these
giants
use
them
after
extended
observation
i
was
almost
tempted
to
wonder
why
our
arms
were
placed
so
high
on
the
body
these
jupiterites
are
more
handsome
than
the
people
on
the
moon
or
mars
and
their
faces
shine
with
a
superior
intelligence
instead
of
hair
on
the
head
they
have
something
unknown
to
our
world
quite
similar
in
appearance
to
wool
their
two
eyes
blaze
like
balls
of
fire
making
one
of
the
giants
appear
like
a
fiersome
though
not
repulsive
monster
the
most
unusual
feature
about
the
face
is
the
peculiarity
of
the
chin
and
forehead
each
is
covered
with
convolutions
of
an
insensible
membrane
the
people
of
jupiter
excel
in
mechanical
skill
they
build
houses
but
not
by
long
tedious
days
of
painstaking
labor
such
things
as
plaster
and
paint
are
unknown
a
jupiterite
can
purchase
from
one
of
the
mammoth
structural
factories
house
sides
house
ends
house
floors
or
partitions
after
any
general
design
he
wishes
and
have
them
trimmed
in
any
style
his
fancy
suggests
the
materials
used
are
and
and
will
wear
indefinitely
these
houses
can
be
put
together
in
a
few
days
and
the
trimmings
adjusted
in
less
than
two
weeks
unless
the
structure
is
very
elaborate
nearly
all
of
their
house
furniture
is
also
and
no
one
has
ever
conceived
the
idea
of
forming
a
fire
insurance
company
simply
because
there
is
no
need
for
one
as
the
people
are
so
much
larger
than
we
so
are
all
things
relatively
larger
than
we
see
them
in
our
world
wagons
and
carriages
and
cars
appear
as
if
they
were
made
for
mastodons
i
saw
one
of
their
largest
bridges
spanning
a
molten
lake
aside
of
it
the
east
river
bridge
would
be
a
dwarf
either
in
height
or
length
it
is
certainly
thrilling
to
step
into
a
world
where
all
things
are
so
gigantic
at
times
a
feeling
of
insignificance
crept
over
me
but
i
took
courage
when
i
thought
that
a
man
greatness
consists
in
his
mental
powers
and
not
in
his
physical
bulk
for
it
is
true
that
the
fifty
ounces
of
brain
in
the
skull
of
a
newton
have
accomplished
more
marvels
than
the
ten
pounds
of
found
in
the
most
cultured
jupiterite
we
must
give
the
people
of
jupiter
credit
for
exercising
a
large
amount
of
common
sense
in
many
ways
they
are
more
practical
than
we
and
this
is
quite
as
noticeable
in
their
language
as
in
any
other
respect
they
have
one
simple
language
for
the
whole
globe
and
in
its
use
they
are
all
agreed
their
vocabulary
is
small
because
they
have
not
yet
branched
out
into
the
infinite
varieties
of
manufacture
and
invention
their
words
have
a
marvelous
correspondence
with
the
thought
or
the
action
expressed
the
manner
of
emphasizing
syllables
going
a
great
distance
toward
expressing
the
shade
of
emotion
desired
i
admired
especially
one
thing
on
this
bulky
planet
they
have
but
one
authority
for
language
hence
there
is
no
century
webster
worcester
or
standard
each
rivaling
the
others
for
supremacy
to
confuse
the
honest
student
with
diverse
spellings
and
pronunciations
the
words
of
the
language
of
jupiter
are
all
embodied
in
one
unique
dictionary
which
is
revised
at
intervals
by
a
board
of
official
educators
to
this
board
all
suggestions
for
inserting
new
words
and
changing
the
classification
of
old
ones
must
be
given
for
their
consideration
this
dictionary
is
printed
by
the
government
and
a
copy
of
it
is
furnished
free
to
all
public
places
and
to
each
private
family
when
a
revision
is
made
a
copy
of
all
the
changes
is
furnished
to
each
dictionary
holder
the
authority
of
this
dictionary
is
final
and
no
one
is
permitted
to
publish
a
conflicting
work
the
jupiterites
have
displayed
their
highest
genius
in
their
astronomical
advancements
they
know
all
about
the
solar
system
and
have
made
discoveries
inside
of
neptune
orbit
which
our
astronomers
have
never
observed
i
was
thrilled
with
delight
when
i
saw
their
telescopes
with
the
marvelous
lenses
that
opened
the
locked
doors
of
the
milky
way
no
wonder
the
astronomers
of
jupiter
have
a
more
comprehensive
view
of
the
universe
than
we
have
their
lenses
are
so
powerful
that
they
have
seen
the
outlines
of
our
rugged
mountains
and
have
discovered
on
our
world
unmistakable
signs
of
human
life
during
my
visit
thither
the
experts
were
working
on
a
much
larger
lens
and
it
is
claimed
that
when
this
is
finished
human
forms
can
be
discerned
on
the
earth
and
can
be
seen
with
more
accuracy
on
mars
the
five
moons
that
revolve
around
jupiter
have
been
studied
with
marked
interest
two
of
these
moons
have
displayed
definite
signs
of
human
life
it
is
promised
also
that
the
coming
lens
will
unlock
the
doors
of
the
several
moons
and
permit
the
astronomers
of
jupiter
to
pry
into
the
secrets
of
their
celestial
neighbors
during
the
past
one
thousand
years
the
jupiterites
have
made
numberless
attempts
to
establish
communication
between
these
moons
and
their
planet
but
all
their
efforts
have
failed
either
the
moonites
are
too
stupid
or
the
jupiterites
are
not
expert
enough
in
throwing
out
signals
or
in
building
air
ships
for
no
one
thing
more
than
another
did
i
envy
the
astronomers
of
jupiter
than
for
their
marvelous
magnifying
lenses
i
knew
that
if
we
had
such
lenses
or
the
material
to
make
them
we
could
watch
with
ease
the
inhabitants
of
the
moon
or
of
mars
and
we
could
study
the
intelligent
life
on
mercury
and
venus
to
say
nothing
of
the
great
advantages
we
should
have
in
observing
comets
and
all
the
numberless
starry
systems
scattered
throughout
illimitable
space
the
religious
life
of
jupiter
proved
to
be
intensely
interesting
to
me
they
have
a
sacred
book
which
corresponds
to
our
bible
and
it
has
always
remained
in
its
original
form
because
there
is
but
one
language
since
i
left
my
own
world
i
had
not
felt
so
kindred
a
touch
in
spirit
as
when
i
invisibly
entered
one
of
their
great
temples
of
worship
as
we
might
call
it
no
vocal
music
was
there
but
the
mute
beckoning
of
several
thousand
arms
as
if
to
implore
the
favor
of
the
great
inzoork
or
creator
was
impressively
eloquent
to
me
i
was
thrilled
with
joy
as
i
learned
more
of
their
religion
i
found
that
their
love
and
service
were
akin
to
those
of
our
planet
and
that
these
same
bonds
unite
them
one
to
another
my
conceptions
were
enlarging
as
i
saw
the
family
of
god
enlarging
and
i
felt
that
although
i
was
unlike
them
in
the
physical
yet
i
was
their
brother
in
spirit
and
that
we
all
have
one
father
religious
liberty
was
enjoyed
until
a
few
centuries
ago
when
certain
restrictions
were
formulated
it
was
seen
that
some
in
exercising
their
liberty
proved
to
be
a
curse
to
the
state
and
consequently
a
sharp
battle
ensued
against
the
liberal
element
the
church
won
the
conflict
and
now
the
profession
of
atheism
is
not
allowed
if
it
can
be
shown
that
any
sane
person
takes
such
a
position
he
is
given
a
certain
period
to
recant
if
recantation
is
not
forthcoming
he
is
placed
in
the
public
until
he
acknowledges
the
existence
of

atheists
are
scarce
under
this
severe
ruling
you
may
well
know
how
i
was
startled
to
see
such
summary
action
taken
in
regard
to
unbelievers
at
first
i
prided
myself
that
i
belonged
to
a
world
of
free
thought
and
free
speech
but
when
i
saw
the
magnetic
effect
of
these
jupiter
regulations
i
was
in
doubt
as
to
the
superiority
of
our
religious
and
irreligious
liberties
the
soil
of
jupiter
yields
abundantly
the
animals
are
all
large
and
of
species
unknown
to
us
they
have
animals
that
resemble
our
elephant
and
ox
these
they
use
for
food
common
birds
as
large
as
geese
or
turkeys
flourish
in
the
extensive
forests
and
furnish
about
of
the
food
for
the
giants
the
vegetation
is
after
the
order
of
our
world
except
that
the
curse
of
weeds
and
thistles
is
only
as
great
but
the
people
of
jupiter
have
learned
more
than
we
of
the
use
of
these
weeds
and
certain
of
them
are
cultivated
to
a
wide
extent
i
spent
a
long
time
on
the
planet
i
saw
the
fiery
lakes
that
are
fed
by
subterraneous
streams
of
lava
and
the
geysers
of
blue
flame
darting
their
immense
tongues
high
in
the
air
as
near
as
fifty
miles
to
these
fiery
centers
can
be
seen
gardens
of
vegetation
and
fields
under
cultivation
i
yielded
at
last
to
a
desire
that
prompted
me
to
make
a
personal
appearance
so
i
stopped
on
a
thoroughfare
and
occupied
a
rustic
seat
at
the
roadside
i
was
dressed
in
my
earthly
costume
and
sat
composedly
awaiting
developments
the
first
living
creature
that
observed
my
presence
was
a
passing
quadruped
it
was
larger
than
a
wild
goat
and
was
a
small
specimen
after
its
kind
for
want
of
a
better
name
i
will
call
it
a
dog
as
soon
as
i
was
spied
by
this
animal
he
set
up
a
hideous
howl
and
ran
at
full
speed
knowing
my
own
homeliness
i
had
all
charity
for
the
animal
and
did
not
censure
him
for
being
so
terribly
frightened
at
my
appearance
soon
a
full
grown
giant
came
along
he
chanced
to
be
a
learned
professor
out
for
an
evening
walk
as
we
would
say
he
seemed
to
be
in
deep
meditation
and
did
not
notice
me
until
he
was
near
my
side
then
he
stood
breathless
while
a
feeling
of
fear
and
surprise
evidently
possessed
him
i
sat
motionless
looking
up
into
his
eyes
and
saw
the
convolutions
on
his
forehead
and
chin
quivering
quite
perceptibly
he
evidently
judged
me
to
be
some
undeveloped
species
of
an
animal
of
jupiter
bearing
faint
resemblance
to
our
to
my
surprise
he
suddenly
grasped
me
and
tightly
held
me
fast
in
his
gigantic
arms
i
made
no
effort
to
free
myself
his
surprise
was
only
intensified
at
my
resignation
he
expected
a
struggle
but
i
neither
made
an
outcry
nor
resisted
capture
like
an
infant
i
lay
in
his
arms
while
he
passed
quick
glances
all
over
me
he
was
baffled
beyond
all
measure
and
hurried
away
toward
the
great
college
near
by
upon
reaching
the
museum
department
i
was
placed
in
a
strong
cage
and
the
doors
were
doubly
secured
my
captor
ran
from
my
presence
and
in
a
few
moments
returned
with
two
other
professors
they
peered
into
the
cage
in
painful
astonishment
while
i
contented
myself
by
taking
my
watch
apart
and
occasionally
glancing
at
my
select
audience
then
commenced
the
jibbering
consultation
all
of
which
i
well
understood
my
captor
related
the
full
circumstances
in
connection
with
his
walk
in
the
grove
and
the
manner
in
which
he
captured
me
he
dwelt
particularly
on
the
indifference
i
manifested
in
all
his
dealings
with
me
it
is
a
baby
suggested
the
one
professor
while
the
other
advanced
the
theory
that
i
was
an
abnormal
child
of
some
jupiterite
my
watch
excited
their
curiosity
one
reached
his
hand
cautiously
through
the
bars
and
evinced
by
his
actions
what
he
wanted
i
looked
up
into
his
eyes
and
spoke
my
first
words
patience
please
till
i
put
the
watch
together
and
you
shall
have
it
not
only
did
his
arms
fly
away
from
the
cage
but
his
whole
body
fell
prostrate
to
the
floor
whether
from
fright
or
surprise
i
knew
not
his
two
companions
were
also
in
a
sorry
plight
i
pretended
not
to
notice
their
consternation
and
kept
myself
busy
in
placing
the
parts
of
my
watch
together
after
a
while
i
was
addressed
by
a
trembling
questioner
where
is
your
home
my
child
i
did
not
lift
my
eyes
but
completed
my
little
task
and
at
once
raised
the
watch
in
fulfillment
of
my
promise
the
timid
professor
ventured
to
accept
it
and
as
he
received
it
from
my
hand
he
again
asked
where
is
your
home
farther
away
than
the
circumference
of
your
world
i
distinctly
answered
at
this
time
the
three
agreed
that
i
was
an
insane
child
born
out
of
time
and
that
i
satisfied
my
propensities
by
gathering
to
myself
such
idiotic
things
as
my
watch
and
garments
including
my
hat
and
shoes
a
quiet
consultation
followed
after
which
one
of
the
professors
retired
from
the
room
and
soon
returned
with
certain
morsels
of
food
upon
handing
them
to
me
i
at
once
remarked
keep
these
morsels
for
yourself
i
have
better
food
to
eat
of
which
you
know
nothing
the
other
two
professors
had
by
this
time
observed
that
my
watch
was
a
marvelous
piece
of
mechanism
beyond
their
most
delicate
accomplishments
and
they
announced
the
fact
to
their
other
companion
who
again
looked
at
me
in
breathless
surprise
where
did
you
get
this
or
plaything
he
queried
in
one
breath
farther
away
than
the
circumference
of
your
world
was
my
evasive
and
to
them
unsatisfactory
reply
wo
you
tell
us
child
how
far
away
that
is
asked
another
with
subdued
impatience
millions
of
miles
of
course
i
spoke
in
terms
of
their
linear
measurements
how
many
millions
sometimes
five
hundred
and
sometimes
six
hundred
millions
without
giving
them
a
chance
for
asking
me
another
question
i
offered
to
let
them
see
my
home
if
they
would
permit
me
to
use
the
most
powerful
telescope
in
their
observatory
my
listeners
were
indeed
amazed
and
were
about
to
pour
upon
me
a
volley
of
interrogations
i
assured
them
that
i
would
answer
no
more
questions
until
i
knew
whether
my
request
would
be
granted
this
necessitated
a
consultation
with
the
chief
astronomer
who
upon
learning
of
my
peculiar
request
and
of
my
unnatural
formation
hastened
to
the
museum
to
see
the
monstrosity
i
knew
from
what
i
had
previously
learned
that
this
gentleman
was
the
greatest
living
astronomer
on
jupiter
he
peered
at
me
in
the
cage
and
was
dumfounded
he
exchanged
a
few
sentences
with
the
professor
and
again
turned
to
me
at
what
time
do
you
want
the
telescope
he
asked
immediately
you
shall
have
it
just
to
satisfy
our
curiosity
he
said
as
he
hastened
from
the
room
i
heard
the
professor
caution
him
strictly
to
tell
no
one
of
my
presence
so
as
to
avoid
a
rush
from
the
student
ranks
in
less
than
an
hour
i
stood
at
the
side
of
the
largest
telescope
in
our
solar
system
watching
the
deepening
shadows
of
night
as
they
fell
upon
jupiter
illustration
viewing
our
earth
from
jupiter
i
spent
another
hour
examining
the
ponderous
machinery
that
was
required
to
swing
this
mammoth
instrument
and
to
adjust
it
when
scanning
the
heavens
by
this
time
my
four
companions
were
convinced
that
i
was
not
an
idiot
and
i
could
see
by
their
strange
manner
that
they
were
regarding
me
as
a
spirit
i
gave
my
directions
to
the
astronomer
and
beheld
the
cylinder
feet
in
length
and
twenty
feet
in
diameter
swing
around
until
it
pointed
toward
a
little
flickering
light
that
shone
like
a
distant
star
i
looked
into
the
managed
to
get
the
tube
pointed
accurately
and
then
requested
the
astronomer
to
focus
the
lenses
so
as
to
bear
upon
the
planetary
light
in
range
he
knew
at
once
the
planet
i
had
singled
out
he
called
it
after
the
focusing
was
completed
i
looked
and
behold
i
could
readily
discern
many
of
the
physical
features
of
my
own
world
that
is
my
homeland
i
cried
triumphantly
i
live
on
or
earth
as
we
call
it
of
course
my
listeners
were
incredulous
but
i
proceeded
to
explain
to
them
as
i
looked
through
the
telescope
that
dark
ridge
to
the
left
is
called
rocky
and
andes
mountain
systems
the
shining
belt
on
the
central
portion
is
the
river
the
rough
ridge
to
the
right
is
allegheny
system
of
mountains
then
i
indicated
the
location
of
our
larger
cities
as
i
pointed
to
new
york
i
saw
a
mere
speck
moving
i
was
convinced
that
it
was
one
of
our
large
steamships
and
as
i
so
explained
the
astronomer
looked
at
me
with
absorbing
interest
he
informed
me
that
he
had
often
seen
the
moving
of
the
spots
and
thought
they
were
some
cloud
formations
peculiar
to
our
world
but
i
insisted
on
the
steamship
explanation
and
proceeded
to
describe
an
ocean
liner
for
these
jupiterites
are
not
familiar
with
oceans
of
cold
water
on
which
float
numerous
craft
i
was
then
a
royal
guest
and
passed
a
most
felicitous
night
with
these
four
celebrities
we
talked
of
the
more
powerful
telescope
that
the
government
of
jupiter
was
manufacturing
and
of
the
still
greater
views
it
promised
to
reveal
then
i
informed
them
of
our
system
of
science
they
were
astonished
at
the
great
civilization
extant
on
or
our
earth
i
told
them
that
a
subtile
power
lay
dormant
in
the
atoms
and
molecules
of
matter
which
could
be
released
and
utilized
and
that
we
in
our
world
called
it
electricity
during
the
night
i
learned
that
the
convolutions
on
the
chin
and
forehead
of
a
jupiterite
served
the
purpose
of
a
new
sense
by
the
aid
of
these
convolutions
any
person
of
jupiter
can
tell
in
daylight
or
darkness
the
nature
of
any
surrounding
substance
whether
it
be
hard
or
soft
combustible
or
good
for
food
or
not
i
confess
that
i
was
unable
to
grasp
the
idea
intelligently
so
the
people
on
the
moon
had
the
same
difficulty
in
understanding
the
use
of
my
nose
before
morning
dawned
i
informed
my
appreciative
quartette
that
i
would
see
them
no
more
that
i
had
paused
at
jupiter
station
long
enough
and
that
i
must
be
off
on
my
vast
excursion
trip
they
earnestly
entreated
me
to
remain
so
that
the
college
students
and
representative
persons
could
get
a
glimpse
of
me
but
i
refused
all
their
entreaties
when
they
found
that
i
had
power
to
leave
them
instantly
they
besought
me
to
remain
for
a
few
last
words
shall
we
not
see
you
again
affectingly
asked
the
astronomer
i
told
them
that
i
expected
to
spend
eternity
in
the
kingdom
of
our
god
who
made
all
the
stars
and
worlds
and
holds
each
in
its
respective
place
if
you
are
pure
in
heart
to
him
i
continued
there
can
be
no
doubt
but
that
we
shall
see
one
another
again
in
that
happy
celestial
center
where
our
eyes
will
be
our
telescopes
where
our
pure
hearts
will
assent
to
the
fatherhood
of
god
and
where
our
souls
will
be
quickened
at
the
universal
fountain
of
love
chapter
beautiful
saturn
a
delightfully
busy
world
next
met
my
gaze
saturn
supreme
in
love
with
its
mysterious
rings
and
its
eight
moons
now
held
my
attention
and
won
my
admiration
this
world
is
almost
as
large
as
jupiter
and
its
soil
is
more
fertile
the
inhabitants
resemble
us
in
physical
appearance
except
that
they
are
twice
our
size
like
jupiter
it
is
enveloped
in
thick
clouds
which
are
never
at
rest
this
changing
atmosphere
causes
continual
friction
of
particles
and
this
serves
to
produce
sufficient
heat
to
counteract
the
frigid
blasts
that
would
otherwise
freeze
out
the
whole
planet
these
atmospheric
conditions
attracted
my
attention
to
a
great
degree
i
estimated
as
best
i
could
and
ascertained
that
saturn
receives
as
much
heat
from
this
peculiar
atmosphere
as
our
earth
receives
from
the
sun
as
i
found
it
on
jupiter
so
i
found
it
here
the
human
eye
is
so
constructed
that
it
seems
to
have
more
than
an
power
for
it
can
look
through
this
atmosphere
as
readily
as
we
can
peer
through
ours
the
air
of
saturn
being
so
thick
contains
much
natural
nourishment
and
the
inhabitants
are
sustained
largely
by
breathing
this
reminded
me
of
the
manner
in
which
our
fish
flourish
in
the
waters
of
our
globe
marvelous
indeed
are
the
possibilities
of
life
i
now
had
before
me
new
problems
to
solve
for
natural
laws
have
but
a
limited
expression
in
our
own
world
here
science
puts
on
new
garments
but
they
are
all
cut
in
harmony
with
universal
laws
woman
is
the
ruling
genius
of
this
planet
being
untrammeled
for
a
few
thousand
years
she
has
attained
a
higher
glory
than
her
sex
has
reached
in
any
world
of
our
solar
system
as
you
scan
the
honor
rolls
of
saturn
reading
the
list
of
the
eminent
leaders
in
science
art
and
philosophy
you
will
readily
observe
that
woman
has
forged
to
the
front
she
also
sits
upon
the
principal
thrones
of
temporal
power
woman
beauty
on
saturn
is
surpassing
it
reaches
a
higher
degree
of
perfection
than
any
of
the
myriad
types
of
beauty
on
this
enchanting
world
when
i
first
opened
my
eyes
on
these
scenes
i
imagined
that
i
had
reached
heaven
but
to
my
chagrin
i
soon
found
the
black
marks
of
sin
that
stain
the
whole
planet
the
illustrious
inventors
of
saturn
living
and
dead
make
a
long
list
which
is
headed
by
the
name
of
veorda
a
woman
of
marvelous
intellect
she
looked
into
the
mysteries
of
nature
with
a
shrewd
wizard
eye
but
unfortunately
lost
her
life
early
in
a
bold
experiment
with
explosives
however
before
she
reached
her
end
she
had
won
enough
honor
to
outshine
all
inventors
in
the
whole
history
of
saturn
she
was
the
sole
inventor
of
all
explosives
and
she
had
learned
how
to
operate
them
without
making
any
noise
or
smoke
this
proved
a
valuable
aid
to
factories
and
quarries
and
particularly
in
the
handling
of
fire
arms
of
which
saturn
has
a
very
strange
collection
before
veorda
was
born
the
flying
machine
had
been
invented
and
used
but
aerial
travel
was
soon
abandoned
owing
to
some
terrible
accidents
that
had
occurred
during
the
earlier
part
of
her
career
veorda
labored
assiduously
until
she
overcame
a
few
difficulties
and
thereby
perfected
the
flying
machine
illustration
an
air
ship
on
saturn
it
was
a
day
of
international
rejoicing
when
her
perfected
machine
sailed
over
the
governments
of
saturn
the
invention
stood
every
test
and
at
once
air
traffic
was
resumed
and
maintained
when
this
woman
died
the
governments
erected
to
her
memory
the
finest
and
costliest
monument
that
now
stands
on
the
whole
world
of
saturn
of
course
i
went
to
see
it
as
i
stood
studying
the
poetry
of
the
pillars
i
looked
overhead
and
saw
one
of
the
immense
aerial
ships
carrying
a
pleasure
party
to
a
distant
point
i
can
not
describe
my
feelings
as
i
lingered
in
the
presence
of
the
sleeping
dust
and
saw
the
imperishable
influence
of
her
thoughts
still
working
for
her
in
a
carnal
sense
a
more
exceeding
and
eternal
weight
of
glory
yet
with
all
this
homage
paid
to
veorda
i
can
not
believe
that
she
is
more
illustrious
than
the
present
living
wizard
of
our
world
the
notable
edison
veorda
lived
and
died
a
devoted
worshipper
of
the
great
influence
or
god
and
it
is
delightful
to
think
that
we
shall
associate
with
such
great
minds
in
our
eternal
abode
in
that
broader
life
where
the
pure
of
all
spheres
gather
will
i
do
wrong
if
i
quote
that
sublime
beatitude
making
it
applicable
to
all
worlds
blessed
are
the
pure
in
heart
for
they
shall
see
god
the
written
language
of
saturn
resembles
the
chinese
character
language
only
it
is
much
more
smooth
and
more
complete
the
shakespeare
of
that
planet
is
a
woman
called
who
has
been
dead
twelve
hundred
years
her
writings
have
been
quoted
and
esteemed
as
masterpieces
all
through
these
ages
her
style
is
singular
resembling
the
proverbs
of
solomon
with
a
little
more
ornament
in
the
language
as
to
the
subject
matter
her
epigrammatic
sentences
are
grouped
and
classified
with
an
accuracy
that
is
both
pleasing
and
popular
at
intervals
the
reader
is
treated
with
a
sprinkling
of
alliterative
sentences
shines
as
an
eternal
star
among
the
great
names
of
her
world
like
veorda
she
was
and
possessed
fine
moral
and
spiritual
qualities
she
passed
out
into
that
broader
life
where
language
is
sweeter
and
thoughts
are
more
holy
in
music
i
noticed
the
most
radical
departures
the
popular
home
instrument
is
larger
than
our
organ
and
has
nearly
one
hundred
keys
arranged
somewhat
like
the
keyboard
of
a
typewriter
these
keys
and
their
combinations
are
capable
of
rendering
sounds
to
correspond
with
every
syllable
found
in
their
words
a
proper
familiarity
with
these
sounds
is
a
part
of
every
child
training
on
saturn
when
one
plays
on
this
instrument
every
sound
struck
on
the
keys
represents
a
certain
sound
thus
the
listener
hears
the
sounds
more
distinctly
than
we
hear
the
words
of
a
phonograph
under
such
conditions
a
musician
is
capable
of
interpreting
his
exact
feelings
when
manipulating
the
keys
he
talks
to
his
listeners
with
organ
sounds
the
great
poet
musicians
can
breathe
out
their
inspirations
in
rapturous
melodies
on
special
occasions
famous
musicians
are
employed
to
render
original
selections
addresses
and
lectures
are
also
given
in
this
manner
with
very
pleasing
results
the
saturnites
know
nothing
of
the
telephone
telegraph
or
phonograph
but
for
carrying
messages
they
have
a
signal
system
by
which
intelligence
is
flashed
from
one
point
to
another
with
great
rapidity
saturn
has
eight
moons
and
is
surrounded
with
the
rings
which
have
made
it
famous
from
the
time
the
planet
was
first
seen
through
the
telescope
these
rings
and
moons
are
inhabited
by
a
type
of
human
beings
altogether
different
from
those
that
live
on
the
planet
and
are
distinctly
visible
to
the
dwellers
of
saturn
by
means
of
powerful
telescopes
the
human
beings
on
the
rings
are
not
able
to
watch
their
neighbors
in
space
having
no
instruments
to
carry
their
vision
beyond
the
boundaries
of
their
own
peculiar
abodes
the
most
picturesque
sight
of
all
the
solar
system
is
seen
as
you
stand
on
saturn
and
watch
the
rings
and
the
eight
moons
chasing
one
another
in
the
heavens
above
you
the
inhabitants
of
this
beautiful
world
believe
that
the
soul
of
each
at
death
passes
out
into
the
spirit
life
on
the
rings
where
it
will
continue
in
a
blissful
existence
until
the
final
judgment
the
religious
life
of
saturn
is
officially
controlled
by
men
there
are
many
creeds
each
with
its
own
devoted
followers
the
leading
church
of
this
world
was
not
organized
until
seven
thousand
years
after
religious
life
took
a
distinctive
form
then
a
man
named
trique
who
was
a
shrewd
student
of
the
times
after
a
careful
study
of
the
weaknesses
found
in
existing
religious
bodies
and
after
amassing
enormous
wealth
in
business
founded
a
new
church
on
a
neat
practical
business
plan
which
may
thus
be
briefly
described
in
terms
and
figures
of
our
own
language
trique
had
a
fortune
of
two
hundred
millions
which
by
investment
netted
him
twenty
millions
annually
these
net
earnings
he
used
to
establish
his
new
denomination
he
commenced
operations
simultaneously
at
the
capitol
of
each
of
the
four
governments
of
saturn
and
at
each
place
built
two
magnificent
churches
costing
one
million
dollars
apiece
it
took
over
three
years
of
our
time
to
build
these
eight
churches
before
one
year
had
expired
he
had
started
fifty
other
churches
in
the
centers
of
saturn
population
these
churches
averaged
in
cost
three
hundred
thousand
dollars
each
thus
the
plan
continued
ever
starting
new
structures
until
all
saturn
was
decorated
with
the
churches
of
trique
even
village
edifices
costing
from
ten
to
thousand
dollars
so
much
for
the
mere
outward
part
of
the
church
which
anybody
might
create
if
he
had
recourse
to
such
enormous
wealth
before
trique
commenced
any
one
of
his
buildings
he
canvassed
the
whole
community
for
charter
members
of
his
church
these
were
composed
of
two
classes
spiritual
and
connected
this
canvassing
was
done
by
the
finest
scholars
that
trique
could
employ
each
one
was
supposed
to
be
the
pastor
of
the
community
he
canvassed
the
conditions
of
the
charter
membership
were
easy
to
meet
all
that
was
required
for
connected
membership
was
a
good
moral
life
and
a
lip
confession
of
the
faith
on
account
of
the
superior
advantages
offered
by
the
trique
church
it
grew
steadily
from
the
beginning
i
will
here
append
a
few
characteristics
of
the
organization
the
church
takes
care
of
all
its
members
during
sickness
furnishing
a
physician
and
all
necessary
medicines
free
of
charge
the
church
owns
drug
stores
and
graduates
its
own
physicians
the
church
has
its
own
salaried
undertakers
and
defrays
all
funeral
expenses
the
church
supplies
a
moral
and
spiritual
education
to
all
the
children
of
its
members
this
school
does
a
work
similar
to
our
only
it
is
held
daily
and
is
under
a
trained
corps
of
paid
teachers
for
all
these
advantages
each
member
is
required
to
give
to
the
church
of
his
earnings
and
to
attend
the
services
of
the
church
and
with
the
pastor
in
the
advancement
of
all
spiritual
work
the
church
keeps
a
perpetual
record
of
the
attendance
and
the
work
done
by
each
member
it
required
a
man
of
large
business
capacity
to
launch
such
a
church
with
its
radically
new
principles
but
trique
immense
wealth
was
a
powerful
force
when
utilized
in
this
manner
he
made
every
church
a
strong
business
center
commanding
the
respect
of
the
whole
community
discipline
was
rigidly
enforced
no
member
cared
to
be
expelled
from
such
a
church
it
meant
a
going
out
from
under
a
warm
cover
at
the
approach
of
winter
fortunately
trique
was
a
clean
spiritual
man
and
strongly
urged
a
spiritual
ministry
and
membership
it
can
be
seen
why
this
church
grew
so
rapidly
in
fifty
years
it
became
so
powerful
that
it
could
control
if
it
wished
the
legislation
in
nearly
all
the
sections
of
the
planet
i
have
given
but
a
brief
picture
of
this
ruling
church
it
must
suffice
i
may
add
that
one
must
not
imagine
the
church
services
and
forms
in
saturn
to
be
like
our
worship
all
things
are
so
different
that
it
would
take
much
space
and
time
to
describe
them
for
beauty
of
natural
scenery
saturn
surpasses
all
the
solar
system
its
air
is
of
a
different
composition
from
ours
and
its
sky
puts
on
various
tints
as
the
day
passes
which
is
a
little
over
ten
hours
of
our
time
but
it
takes
nearly
thirty
of
our
years
to
make
one
on
saturn
the
immense
mountain
ranges
present
a
picture
of
unusual
beauty
the
leaves
of
trees
are
rich
in
velvety
varieties
and
the
undergrowth
appears
as
if
trimmed
by
skilled
hands
this
is
a
desirable
place
to
live
but
i
learned
that
the
inhabitants
of
saturn
do
not
appreciate
all
this
wealth
of
beauty
in
its
atmosphere
or
on
its
earth
a
whit
more
than
the
people
of
our
world
appreciate
the
sin
cursed
scenery
which
greets
their
eyes
chapter
vi
the
nearest
fixed
star
all
that
was
required
on
my
part
was
a
mere
act
of
the
mind
and
i
went
where
i
wished
i
visited
uranus
and
neptune
after
which
i
stretched
my
swift
wings
for
the
great
flight
away
from
our
solar
system
over
billions
of
miles
of
space
i
alighted
on
the
burning
star
nearest
to
our
earth
this
star
is
called
by
our
astronomers
alpha
centaurus
and
it
is
said
to
be
miles
away
this
star
is
much
greater
than
our
sun
and
is
the
center
of
a
system
of
worlds
larger
and
more
numerous
than
those
that
compose
our
solar
system
you
can
not
imagine
my
surprise
when
i
reached
alpha
centaurus
and
found
that
it
was
inhabited
by
a
class
of
human
creatures
who
were
created
to
live
and
flourish
in
fire
their
customs
and
habits
are
so
strange
that
i
am
not
capable
of
giving
an
intelligent
description
of
them
i
know
that
it
is
inconceivable
to
us
how
life
can
be
developed
and
sustained
in
the
midst
of
a
burning
sun
and
i
found
that
these
beings
in
turn
could
not
conceive
how
life
can
exist
in
a
cold
world
like
ours
these
creatures
have
no
digestive
organs
they
live
in
part
on
the
chemical
action
produced
by
fire
breathing
the
hotter
the
fire
the
more
easily
is
life
sustained
if
they
were
to
get
away
from
the
heat
this
chemical
action
would
cease
and
therefore
death
would
be
as
certain
to
them
as
being
enveloped
in
fire
would
spell
death
to
us
in
our
eyes
their
bodies
are
misshapen
composed
of
elements
most
of
which
are
not
found
in
our
world
there
are
many
cold
places
or
sun
spots
on
alpha
centaurus
but
these
are
shunned
by
the
people
as
death
traps
however
the
centers
of
population
gather
on
the
more
solid
sections
most
of
which
lie
around
the
sun
spots
you
could
scarcely
believe
your
eyes
were
you
to
look
upon
the
durable
works
of
architecture
built
by
these
strangely
shaped
mortals
still
more
wonderful
are
the
seas
of
boiling
fire
which
are
sometimes
comparatively
quiet
and
then
again
in
all
madness
their
majestic
flames
shoot
upward
thousands
of
miles
when
the
sea
is
quiet
life
is
oppressive
in
the
centers
of
population
just
as
it
is
in
our
world
when
the
air
is
still
and
the
summer
sun
is
pouring
down
upon
us
breathing
is
easier
and
life
is
quickened
when
the
molten
sea
boils
furiously
these
terrible
heat
blasts
are
most
exhilarating
and
refreshing
to
the
inhabitants
living
near
enough
to
receive
the
benefit
of
them
you
may
imagine
that
these
people
of
alpha
centaurus
are
idlers
being
fed
by
the
ceaseless
heat
waves
that
beat
upon
them
such
a
conception
is
totally
false
for
i
saw
that
industry
was
plainly
evident
and
labor
had
its
reward
in
securing
the
necessaries
and
luxuries
of
life
these
foods
are
composed
of
elements
which
can
be
appropriated
into
muscle
and
bone
if
you
will
permit
me
to
use
these
terms
and
are
obtained
by
reuniting
and
spent
forces
this
explanation
is
somewhat
mystical
but
i
can
do
no
better
in
describing
the
food
production
and
assimilation
in
a
pure
like
this
one
on
which
i
had
arrived
to
imagine
and
believe
that
fertility
can
be
possible
in
a
seething
is
too
far
beyond
our
philosophy
to
be
conceivable
alpha
centaurus
is
so
large
a
sun
that
although
it
has
a
population
ten
times
greater
than
our
globe
yet
its
surface
is
sparsely
settled
the
oceans
of
fire
occupy
the
greater
part
of
the
surface
of
this
wonderful
sphere
in
these
great
seas
live
the
monsters
of
the
deep
as
well
as
a
motley
variety
of
other
species
veritable
salamanders
some
grotesquely
hideous
others
surpassingly
beautiful
in
form
and
hue
on
this
sphere
man
is
extraordinarily
intelligent
he
is
almost
totally
ignorant
of
anything
akin
to
astronomy
although
some
of
the
greater
scholars
have
ventured
the
theory
that
there
might
be
other
worlds
containing
human
life
providing
there
be
fire
enough
to
sustain
them
in
some
other
particulars
these
have
made
astonishing
progress
they
believe
that
the
time
is
coming
when
the
fires
of
their
world
will
be
blown
out
and
all
life
become
extinct
this
they
would
call
in
our
language
the
coming
judgment
when
every
human
being
that
ever
lived
will
receive
his
just
recompense
of
reward
with
interest
i
studied
the
manner
of
government
and
the
admirable
system
of
education
which
is
the
secret
of
their
progress
i
made
a
special
effort
to
ascertain
whence
this
sun
receives
its
continued
supply
of
fuel
the
question
had
often
perplexed
my
mind
when
i
gazed
toward
our
sun
from
the
shores
of
our
world
none
of
the
theories
advanced
by
our
scientists
and
astronomers
fully
satisfied
my
mind
and
now
i
looked
and
studied
in
vain
although
the
awful
burnings
had
been
in
progress
for
thousands
of
years
i
could
see
no
fuel
that
was
added
to
the
flames
hence
i
was
driven
to
believe
that
alpha
centaurus
was
on
fire
and
was
gradually
being
consumed
this
must
be
true
of
all
the
stars
that
bedeck
the
canopy
of
heaven
the
inconstancy
of
this
star
surface
is
the
greatest
menace
to
its
inhabitants
at
times
the
solid
crusts
break
in
the
contracting
of
the
surface
all
this
makes
terrible
havoc
but
the
new
generations
take
fresh
courage
and
pluckily
restore
the
fallen
habitations
one
of
the
luxuries
enjoyed
by
these
fire
beings
at
certain
times
is
to
get
where
the
chemical
action
of
heat
is
at
a
low
ebb
that
has
a
similar
effect
upon
them
as
calming
our
nerves
has
upon
us
one
of
the
great
inventions
consists
in
an
instrument
that
neutralizes
this
chemical
action
of
heat
even
where
it
is
most
intense
it
is
a
common
sight
to
see
creatures
basking
under
one
of
these
instruments
in
a
somewhat
comatose
state
the
inventor
of
this
instrument
is
worshiped
almost
as
a
god
one
of
the
most
startling
inventions
of
all
is
a
machine
that
counteracts
gravity
this
to
my
mind
is
the
greatest
invention
i
had
yet
seen
and
strange
to
say
these
fire
creatures
know
nothing
about
means
of
propulsion
except
by
hand
power
if
you
were
able
to
stand
on
the
seething
furnace
of
alpha
centaurus
you
would
see
these
machines
rise
far
into
the
shooting
fire
and
beyond
as
far
as
occupants
can
go
without
freezing
to
death
then
at
a
reverse
of
the
lever
you
would
see
the
mysterious
car
descend
these
star
residents
have
enjoyed
this
invention
so
long
that
they
no
longer
appreciate
its
marvels
you
ask
me
if
i
tried
to
get
the
secret
i
saw
the
whole
apparatus
and
the
more
i
studied
it
the
more
i
was
convinced
that
its
storage
battery
contained
heat
energy
so
i
concluded
to
solve
the
mystery
i
learned
that
there
was
a
certain
element
found
only
in
combination
when
this
element
is
set
loose
by
chemical
process
it
will
rise
at
once
toward
a
large
planet
that
revolves
around
this
sun
this
planet
draws
that
particular
element
with
six
times
more
force
than
it
is
held
by
alpha
centaurus
the
brilliant
chemists
when
they
first
made
this
discovery
separated
enough
of
this
element
to
carry
a
man
upward
from
the
sun
surface
later
on
they
made
a
counter
discovery
of
equal
value
they
found
a
substance
that
would
destroy
this
attraction
if
it
was
placed
between
the
element
and
the
planet
the
discovery
enabled
a
person
to
rise
as
high
as
he
wished
and
then
by
swinging
the
plate
in
position
the
aerial
carriage
would
either
stand
still
or
descend
according
to
the
wish
of
the
operator
what
a
boon
it
would
be
to
our
world
if
we
had
such
an
element
for
which
jupiter
or
the
sun
would
have
so
much
fondness
then
with
our
superior
knowledge
of
propulsion
we
could
forever
settle
the
perplexing
problem
of
aerial
navigation
these
exceptional
people
living
in
such
terrible
fire
wear
pieces
of
garments
made
of
the
finest
texture
the
threads
are
composed
of
metallic
substances
far
more
enduring
than
gold
or
platinum
of
all
the
unthinkable
things
on
this
star
none
are
so
extreme
as
the
manner
in
which
these
people
hold
conversation
they
have
no
organs
to

it
opened
to
me
new
channels
of
thought
and
illustrated
more
emphatically
than
ever
that
all
things
are
possible
with
him
who
created
the
universe
and
upholds
it
by
the
word
of
his
power
finally
i
left
this
strange
abode
and
proceeded
to
visit
some
of
the
eighteen
worlds
that
revolve
around
alpha
centaurus
chapter
vii
the
water
world
visited
as
i
lingered
in
the
region
of
the
constellation
of
centaurus
i
was
more
and
more
profoundly
impressed
with
the
magnitude
and
variety
of
created
worlds
among
the
eighteen
planets
that
revolve
around
alpha
centaurus
only
six
are
inhabited
one
of
these
is
a
sinless
world
or
a
world
whereon
sin
never
inaugurated
its
blighting
reign
but
i
will
say
nothing
of
this
orb
as
i
did
not
have
the
choice
opportunity
of
visiting
it
aright
i
saw
its
beauty
only
through
a
glass
darkly
i
then
fixed
my
mind
on
polaris
commonly
called
the
north
star
in
journeying
thither
from
centaurus
i
passed
thousands
of
solar
systems
scattered
in
space
all
around
me
as
i
was
thus
darting
through
immensity
i
glanced
toward
our
own
solar
system
and
could
see
nothing
but
a
flickering
star
which
was
our
sun
not
the
faintest
sign
could
i
see
of
our
world
or
of
jupiter
a
strange
feeling
passed
over
me
when
i
began
to
realize
how
far
i
was
from
home
i
sped
onward
until
i
reached
the
north
star
it
is
a
burning
sun
but
not
inhabited
polaris
is
the
center
of
a
magnificent
system
if
a
certain
few
of
its
worlds
could
be
seen
through
a
telescope
they
would
be
picturesque
in
the
extreme
somewhat
resembling
our
beautiful
saturn
moons
play
like
frisky
lambs
around
some
of
its
worlds
and
many
comets
dance
through
the
length
of
the
whole
system
in
richer
confusion
than
we
have
ever
beheld
in
the
range
of
our
telescopic
vision
counting
the
worlds
of
larger
size
only
there
are
nearly
one
hundred
that
fly
through
their
orbits
around
polaris
some
with
amazing
velocity
within
the
bounds
of
this
solar
system
i
spent
considerable
time
the
third
world
i
visited
i
will
call
stazza
it
is
two
hundred
millions
of
miles
from
polaris
and
is
four
hundred
and
fifty
times
as
large
as
our
world
i
was
amazed
at
the
new
turn
of
that
i
found
there
to
me
it
was
unusually
interesting
because
its
temperature
is
quite
similar
to
ours
but
the
order
of
life
is
reversed
so
completely
that
the
human
beings
inhabit
the
water
and
the
long
narrow
strips
of
earth
are
infested
with
numerous
species
of
land
animals
it
may
seem
incredible
that
the
depths
of
the
ocean
should
be
the
seat
of
intelligence
rivaling
our
own
the
human
creatures
of
stazza
average
a
trifle
larger
in
size
than
we
but
they
travel
horizontally
in
water
like
a
large
fish
the
limbs
support
the
body
in
rest
and
in
traveling
are
used
like
the
hind
legs
of
a
frog
only
more
gracefully
the
arms
closely
resemble
ours
and
have
an
infinite
variety
of
uses
in
addition
there
are
four
arms
that
fold
into
the
body
when
at
rest
but
are
spread
for
service
when
traveling
in
all
it
must
be
admitted
that
these
stazza
people
are
capable
of
traveling
more
rapidly
and
covering
longer
distances
with
much
less
fatigue
than
are
we
they
can
also
carry
greater
burdens
with
more
ease
they
wear
no
garments
except
one
or
two
small
pieces
made
of
a
tough
species
of
sea
grass
of
stazza
are
covered
with
water
and
its
depth
at
a
few
points
is
very
great
throughout
all
the
water
regions
there
are
many
kinds
of
animal
life
more
than
can
be
found
in
our
oceans
thousands
of
human
lives
have
been
lost
in
conflict
with
the
fiercer
kinds
of
these
water
animals
with
which
the
people
of
stazza
entered
upon
a
war
of
extermination
over
one
thousand
years
ago
and
while
intelligence
is
slowly
winning
the
battle
yet
the
warfare
is
likely
to
continue
many
centuries
to
come
owing
to
the
fact
that
these
hostile
fish
occupy
the
soundless
depths
even
as
deep
as
four
or
five
hundred
miles
according
to
our
measurement
horned
fish
rising
from
these
depths
are
a
horrible
menace
to
excursion
parties
or
caravans
as
well
as
to
settlers
on
what
we
would
call
the
frontier
the
homes
of
stazza
are
made
of
metallic
substances
there
are
a
few
minerals
very
plentiful
resembling
brass
and
it
is
a
common
sight
to
see
polished
buildings
fantastic
in
their
arrangement
shining
through
the
pellucid
water
like
gold
the
cities
are
built
on
gentle
inclines
in
the
deeper
waters
and
present
a
picturesque
scene
they
look
more
like
a
cluster
of
giant
fairy
abodes
than
like
new
york
or
london
nothing
in
all
the
world
of
stazza
resembles
a
product
of
our
manufacture
more
than
the
fine
screening
that
protects
every
human
dwelling
from
an
invasion
of
small
water
animals
it
reminded
me
of
the
mosquito
netting
as
a
against
flies
and
other
insects
in
our
world
but
the
mosquito
baffles
our
genius
for
he
seems
to
be
able
to
get
through
as
small
an
opening
as
air
can
likewise
the
pestiferous
water
animals
seem
to
invade
the
homes
of
stazza
notwithstanding
all
efforts
at
prevention
the
cities
have
no
continuous
streets
or
lanes
the
principal
travel
is
in
the
water
over
the
city
the
main
entrance
to
the
home
is
on
the
housetop
in
the
center
of
large
buildings
there
is
a
shaft
running
up
and
down
through
which
the
people
go
with
greater
ease
than
we
can
climb
or
descend
our
stairways
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
water
to
them
is
the
same
as
air
to
us
and
in
their
domestic
life
the
people
are
annoyed
by
cloudy
and
muddy
currents
of
water
just
as
we
are
by
clouds
of
dust
in
the
air
on
the
streets
or
in
our
homes
the
wear
and
tear
caused
by
the
chemical
action
of
water
on
houses
and
furniture
is
not
as
great
as
the
injury
in
our
world
caused
by
the
chemical
action
of
air
heat
and
moisture
the
educational
systems
of
stazza
are
quite
as
perfect
for
that
world
as
our
own
systems
are
for
ours
they
have
an
alphabet
covering
their
needs
in
language
consisting
of
a
series
of
strokes
curves
and
angles
somewhat
resembling
our
shorthand
systems
this
language
is
identical
in
print
or
script
and
is
superior
to
our
method
of
expresssing
thought
by
handwriting
the
experts
of
stazza
have
learned
the
art
of
slicing
metallic
blocks
into
sheets
of
any
desired
thickness
these
sheets
serve
the
same
purpose
for
them
as
paper
does
for
us
and
are
furnished
at
an
insignificant
cost
of
labor
we
have
the
very
elements
in
our
earth
to
produce
these
metallic
blocks
if
we
knew
the
combination
which
might
be
easily
found
if
we
had
as
much
need
for
them
as
the
people
of
this
water
world
the
metallic
blocks
are
used
for
a
great
variety
of
purposes
there
are
some
high
class
artists
who
have
immortalized
themselves
by
their
one
of
which
i
saw
on
a
metallic
sheet
measuring
about
eight
feet
in
diameter
perhaps
the
most
surprising
feature
of
the
educational
advancement
of
these
water
spirits
is
their
knowledge
of
astronomy
to
them
under
the
water
the
stars
have
always
looked
beautiful
and
from
an
early
date
in
their
history
a
study
of
them
has
engaged
the
attention
of
their
scholars
no
one
could
tell
the
style
of
their
telescopes
if
he
should
go
to
guessing
for
a
week
let
me
give
you
a
brief
description
of
one
they
build
a
metallic
pipe
about
ten
feet
in
diameter
and
from
a
point
some
two
hundred
feet
below
the
surface
of
the
water
the
pipe
is
built
until
it
extends
a
few
feet
above
water
inside
of
this
pipe
is
a
series
of
transparent
ovals
of
various
sizes
these
ovals
are
so
arranged
that
the
upper
one
throws
its
light
to
the
lower
one
down
through
the
immense
cylinder
around
each
oval
is
built
a
series
of
fin
protectors
which
is
the
only
part
about
the
telescope
i
could
not
fully
understand
they
seemed
to
counteract
the
refraction
of
the
water
and
yet
the
water
must
be
in
the
pipe
to
obtain
proper
results
imagine
an
astronomer
at
the
base
of
this
huge
metallic
structure
having
at
his
finger
ends
a
dozen
wire
strings
intricately
connected
with
the
oval
system
and
by
the
proper
use
of
which
he
can
increase
or
decrease
the
magnifying
power
of
the
ponderous
telescope
the
highest
magnifying
power
of
a
telescope
of
this
size
is
so
great
that
the
milky
way
is
penetrated
and
its
solar
systems
revealed
what
an
accomplishment
it
would
be
if
a
telescope
of
this
magnitude
could
be
mounted
a
thing
that
these
creatures
never
attempted
to
do
but
they
have
built
telescopes
of
various
inclinations
all
stationary
you
can
form
an
idea
of
the
patience
and
endurance
of
these
people
when
you
learn
that
it
required
over
fifty
years
of
our
time
for
them
to
perfect
one
of
these
large
instruments
give
human
brains
to
any
animal
under
water
or
over
water
and
it
will
grasp
for
larger
views
of
its
creator
and
of
the
things
he
made
these
people
are
thoroughly
convinced
that
intelligent
life
can
be
found
in
any
world
where
there
is
enough
water
to
sustain
it
in
the
waters
of
stazza
there
are
many
similar
to
our
gulf
stream
these
are
used
by
the
inhabitants
for
transportation
they
construct
little
hammock
cars
so
that
when
they
are
filled
with
human
freight
they
float
in
the
water
a
simple
device
which
we
might
call
a
fin
propeller
is
used
to
force
the
car
in
one
direction
or
another
as
necessity
may
require
it
is
possible
to
enter
one
of
these
and
thus
travel
over
two
thousand
miles
then
by
rowing
only
five
miles
enter
the
return
current
and
move
homeward
a
car
of
special
design
is
furnished
by
each
community
in
which
each
bridal
pair
spends
the
wedlock
ride
or
the
as
we
would
call
it
illustration
fishing
for
land
animals
on
a
planet
of
the
pole
star
there
is
nothing
more
interesting
about
this
race
of
beings
than
the
manner
in
which
they
pluck
land
fruit
and
catch
land
animals
and
yet
when
you
compare
this
with
our
world
it
is
the
same
to
them
as
fishing
is
to
us
in
all
my
journeys
perhaps
there
was
nothing
so
amusing
to
me
as
to
see
a
company
of
these
water
creatures
fishing
for
land
animals
they
would
creep
up
near
shore
and
throw
out
their
wire
lines
with
various
kinds
of
bait
according
to
what
they
wished
to
catch
then
followed
the
inevitable
waiting
until
some
innocent
jullep
or
petzel
would
grasp
the
tempting
morsel
on
the
hook
a
skillful
jerk
fastened
the
victim
and
instead
of
pulling
him
in
the
water
the
fisherman
held
his
breath
and
rushed
out
of
the
water
to
get
his
prize
this
has
been
found
to
be
a
safer
method
than
trying
to
pull
the
prize
into
the
water
these
water
dwellers
relish
certain
land
animals
more
than
we
do
fish
of
course
the
land
strips
are
not
inhabited
by
human
beings
but
vegetation
is
abundant
similar
to
that
found
in
our
tropical
regions
many
kinds
of
fruit
growing
on
the
land
are
sought
after
by
the
masters
of
the
water
in
the
season
when
certain
fruits
are
ripe
whole
expeditions
go
out
to
gather
them
but
how
can
they
live
away
from
the
great
body
of
water
while
plucking
these
fruits
let
me
tell
you
how
they
manage
it
they
have
what
we
would
call
very
wide
and
short
and
equipped
with
buckets
at
the
rear
of
one
of
these
strangely
shaped
carriages
stand
four
or
six
men
abreast
immersing
their
heads
in
the
water
of
the
wagon
for
a
fresh
breath
as
often
as
necessity
requires
thus
they
are
enabled
to
travel
over
land
to
any
desired
locality
always
being
careful
to
keep
near
enough
the
water
to
cover
any
emergency
when
they
arrive
at
the
fruit
each
man
takes
his
bucket
of
water
and
proceeds
to
work
he
plucks
fruit
or
berries
for
about
thirty
seconds
and
then
ducks
his
head
into
his
bucket
of
water
for
a
fresh
breath
then
he
proceeds
as
before
when
the
water
is
no
longer
fit
for
breathing
he
carries
his
fruit
and
water
bucket
to
the
wagon
here
he
unloads
his
fruit
and
refills
his
bucket
from
the
wagon
proceeding
as
before
at
intervals
the
wagon
must
be
refilled
with
water
during
a
day
a
few
men
can
gather
a
large
quantity
of
fruit
in
this
manner
and
it
can
be
preserved
for
over
four
seasons
on
stazza
there
has
been
developed
a
fine
variety
of
water
flowers
and
no
gardens
are
more
beautiful
than
those
that
can
be
seen
there
the
higher
classes
of
these
people
live
a
very
refined
life
and
have
their
homes
surrounded
with
an
endless
variety
of
water
grasses
and
flowers
you
would
scarcely
believe
your
eyes
if
you
could
direct
your
gaze
to
a
few
of
these
homes
in
their
religious
life
these
stazzans
are
eminently
devoted
they
have
no
bunch
of
creeds
from
which
to
take
their
choice
but
follow
the
teachings
of
the
great
interpreter
a
man
who
once
lived
and
reigned
amongst
them
and
who
wrote
his
laws
in
what
we
would
call
by
interpretation
the
book
of
gold
the
leaves
of
this
book
are
made
from
an
element
costly
and
rare
more
precious
to
them
than
gold
is
to
us
from
this
book
all
their
sacred
books
are
copied
the
civil
powers
also
accept
this
book
as
their
authority
and
enforce
its
teachings
sin
there
as
here
is
the
withering
blast
of
the
planet
the
destroyer
of
the
harvest
fields
of
purity
and
truth
an
invisible
spirit
of
evil
holds
his
force
in
disciplined
command
and
the
man
who
wishes
to
have
a
pure
heart
on
stazza
must
reach
it
through
conflicts
long
and
sharp
the
path
to
moral
and
spiritual
purity
is
quite
the
same
throughout
the
whole
universe
chapter
viii
after
i
had
finished
my
interesting
tour
of
stazza
i
visited
in
quick
succession
a
score
or
more
of
worlds
that
also
revolve
around
polaris
at
varying
distances
i
found
the
majority
of
these
planets
barren
of
all
life
owing
principally
to
their
molten
condition
some
unthinkable
types
of
human
existence
are
occupying
the
worlds
that
can
be
inhabited
i
marveled
aloud
as
i
viewed
a
few
more
links
of
the
endless
chain
of
intelligent
creation
on
one
of
these
worlds
which
i
have
christened
i
found
human
beings
that
resemble
us
more
than
any
others
in
the
entire
solar
bounds
of
polaris
dashes
along
in
its
unceasing
course
at
a
distance
of
eight
hundred
millions
of
miles
from
polaris
it
is
much
larger
than
our
world
and
is
accompanied
by
three
moons
and
a
set
of
rings
which
faintly
suggested
our
picturesque
saturn
the
poles
of
are
inclined
at
an
angle
of
degrees
to
the
plane
of
its
orbit
this
accounts
for
its
temperature
being
quite
similar
to
ours
although
its
year
is
eight
times
longer
when
i
first
reached
this
world
i
was
impressed
with
its
wealth
of
natural
scenery
flowers
of
charming
texture
and
color
grew
abundantly
over
the
wide
expanses
the
cultivated
gardens
contained
specimens
of
unusual
beauty
surpassing
the
finest
products
of
our
earth
when
i
examined
the
leaves
of
the
many
kinds
of
trees
i
found
none
similar
to
the
foliage
of
our
planet
except
in
one
or
two
trees
the
sky
instead
of
appearing
blue
wears
a
greenish
tinge
and
the
birds
are
robed
in
a
variety
of
colors
that
would
put
to
naught
our
arching
rainbows
in
fine
it
must
be
admitted
that
is
a
much
more
beautiful
world
than
ours
i
saw
colors
there
that
we
could
not
produce
because
we
have
not
the
proper
elements
this
delightful
world
is
densely
populated
its
history
is
much
older
than
ours
sin
is
firmly
rooted
in
the
whole
planet
and
its
curse
is
just
as
blighting
and
withering
as
it
is
in
our
world
although
it
is
fought
more
successfully
and
overcome
more
effectually
in
the
home
and
in
the
nation
i
observed
that
the
ecclesiastical
system
is
similar
to
ours
and
there
is
a
great
profusion
of
creeds
to
my
surprise
i
noted
in
my
long
journey
that
such
a
variety
did
not
interfere
with
true
progress
but
was
compatible
with
the
purest
kind
of
life
and
the
highest
order
of
civilization
the
people
are
deeply
devoted
to
their
unseen
god
and
their
sacrifices
are
astonishing
their
places
of
worship
are
the
finest
structures
of
the
world
they
believe
it
to
be
wrong
to
construct
any
building
greater
in
beauty
and
value
than
the
temples
of
god
their
music
would
sound
quite
weird
to
us
although
it
is
sweet
harmony
to
the
people
of
the
home
life
of
is
most
beautiful
the
moral
life
of
the
home
and
of
the
nations
is
the
cleanest
of
any
world
in
the
whole
system
of
polaris
naturally
i
investigated
to
learn
the
secret
of
this
happy
condition
then
i
found
to
my
joy
that
the
relation
between
parents
and
children
is
very
noteworthy
the
fine
respect
manifested
by
the
latter
for
the
former
evoked
the
blush
of
shame
as
i
thought
of
the
prevailing
conditions
in
my
own
world
you
may
think
it
absurd
when
i
describe
a
certain
system
that
was
a
stepping
stone
to
such
splendid
results
were
this
peculiar
system
to
be
named
we
should
likely
call
it
the
human
seal
system
each
person
born
into
the
world
of
is
officially
sealed
or
tattooed
on
the
forehead
and
on
the
arm
it
is
done
by
the
township
whose
duty
it
is
to
keep
a
correct
record
of
all
births
devoting
a
new
ledger
page
to
each
infant
this
seal
is
a
mark
and
must
not
be
interfered
with
under
any
circumstances
in
case
the
stamp
is
disturbed
by
accident
the
person
must
report
to
the
township
either
in
person
or
by
proxy
and
the
stamp
must
be
replaced
on
some
conspicuous
part
of
the
head
there
are
eighteen
governments
of
that
united
on
this
scheme
it
is
so
arranged
that
no
two
persons
of
all
these
millions
have
identical
marks
each
government
has
its
seal
of
different
designs
from
all
the
others
circles
ellipses
and
rectangles
with
various
modifications
compose
the
eighteen
forms
in
use
the
most
powerful
of
the
eighteen
governments
has
for
its
seal
the
following
design
which
i
have
filled
out
as
completely
as
i
could
using
our
own
figures
instead
of
their
numerals
which
would
of
course
be
unintelligible
to
us

this
is

the

is
allowed
to
have
a

his
own

provided
he
writes
the
individual

for
any

else
doing
this
would
be
a
forger
the
township
clerk
is
also
the
collector
of
the
public
funds
to
him
each
person
born
in
that
township
is
compelled
to
render
an
annual
report
of
his
residence
occupation
and
certain
other
facts
relating
to
his
life
in
general
if
any
minor
or
adult
commits
a
criminal
act
upon
which
the
civil
court
has
passed
this
finding
is
recorded
in
the
township
record
on
the
individual
page
and
when
the
criminal
has
served
his
sentence
this
fact
is
also
recorded
this
is
a
severe
law
for
the
criminal
but
it
is
a
great
stimulus
to
a
career
it
is
also
customary
for
public
courts
to
confer
on
worthy
persons
special
marks
of
honor
for
extraordinary
deeds
or
acts
a
record
of
such
rendering
is
also
kept
in
presenting
annual
reports
to
the
clerk
each
father
reports
for
his
minor
children
this
puts
the
father
on
a
rightful
plane
of
dignity
before
his
children
and
the
parent
who
makes
a
wise
use
of
these
provisions
can
and
does
reach
far
better
results
than
can
otherwise
be
done
no
child
can
run
away
from
home
without
falling
into
much
more
trouble
then
he
imagined
he
had
before
at

his
seal

is
sent
to
all
the
countries
and
into
every
any
one
aiding
or
abetting
such
a
person
is
severely
punished
when
the
runaway
is
captured
the
system
of
reprimand
is
of
such
a
nature
that
the
minor
will
be
glad
to
remain
under
the
directions
of
his
parents
until
his
maturity
if
it
can
be
shown
that
a
parent
or
guardian
uses
inhuman
methods
of
punishing
children
the
act
is
criminal
and
is
dealt
with
accordingly
there
are
no
tramps
parading
periodically
over
the
countries
of
there
is
an
international
law
that
each
township
must
care
for
its
own
paupers
every

his

and
there
is
no
escaping
from
it
when
a
person
is
suspected
of
crime
in
a
foreign
land
the
foreign
officials
can
tell
not
only
where
the
individual
was
born
but
they
can
also
obtain
an
official
record
of
his
life
by
applying
officially
to
the

and
paying
a
nominal
fee
any
stranger
making
a
serious
effort
to
cover
his

looked
upon
with
suspicion
it
is
a
current
phrase
of
honor
among
the
i
am
not
ashamed
to
show
my
forehead
a
few
hundred
years
after
this
human
seal
law
went
into
operation
no
one
except
the
criminally
inclined
would
think
of
returning
to
the
old
reckless
way
although
the
system
was
scorned
and
ridiculed
by
many
for
about
fifty
years
after
its
advent
in
considering
the
character
of
an
individual
the
courts
and
the
people
place
tremendous
stress
upon
the
township
record
each
son
and
daughter
early
learns
the
value
of
a
stainless
page
and
strives
to
keep
his
record
clean
the
township
through
the
state
gives
to
each
child
at
maturity
a
civil
inheritance
provided
his
record
meets
the
requirements
of
the
law
all
these
customs
and
regulations
are
powerful
incentives
to
the
youth
to
lead
a
good
moral
life
and
naturally
tend
to
a
respectful
demeanor
of
children
toward
their
parents
this
world
is
not
only
notable
for
its
moral
atmosphere
but
for
the
remarkable
progress
its
inhabitants
have
made
in
political
economy
they
know
a
few
things
about
laws
but
not
enough
to
make
them
so
complicated
that
no
one
can
understand
their
meaning
in
law
the
poor
man
usually
has
the
same
chance
as
the
rich
money
has
no
weight
in
the
scale
of
justice
the
facts
in
the
case
are
the
only
things
that
have
weight
although
bribery
is
possible
and
is
sometimes
practiced
the
laws
of
relating
to
deeds
and
titles
are
the
most
simple
and
yet
the
most
effective
that
have
yet
come
to
my
attention
all
the
land
in
each
county
of
is
divided
into
lots
and
each
lot
is
numbered
on
an
immense
diagram
at
the
county
seat
this
diagram
is
a
miniature
relief
outline
of
the
county
with
each
lot
and
plot
in
the
county
designated
and
according
to
our
measurements
it
averages
almost
eighteen
by
feet
varying
according
to
the
size
of
the
county
when
you
buy
land
you
buy
from
the
county
only
if
you
wish
to
purchase
a
lot
or
plot
from
another
party
who
is
willing
to
sell
the
two
parties
concerned
go
to
the
chief
real
estate
agent
who
is
an
official
of
the
county
and
has
charge
of
the
county
diagram
the
former
owner
or
upon
establishing
his
identity
releases
to
the
county
his
claims
and
surrenders
his
title
on
condition
that
he
receives
the
sum
agreed
upon
between
the
two
parties
the
county
agent
then
issues
a
new
title
to
the
new
purchaser
it
is
a
simple
document
completely
describing
the
new
owner
his
relatives
and
his
station
thus
each
purchaser
has
his
own
title
from
the
county
and
it
is
guaranteed
under
this
admirably
simple
system
disputes
as
to
titles
are
rare
and
can
scarcely
occur
but
if
any
should
arise
the
county
takes
the
defense
and
bears
all
expense
of
litigation
no
counter
claim
is
even
heard
after
a
title
is
five
years
old
thus
it
is
impossible
to
resurrect
an
old
buried
claim
and
rob
an
innocent
owner
who
purchased
and
paid
for
his
ground
in
good
faith
in
transferring
real
estate
no
lawyers
are
required
several
persons
however
must
witness
the
execution
of
the
deed
the
county
publishes
a
journal
monthly
stating
the
owner
of
each
lot
or
plot
number
in
the
county
this
is
furnished
free
to
each
land
owner
all
credit
to
for
these
regulations
our
laws
covering
this
field
are
heathenish
compared
with
the
statutes
of
this
far
distant
world
there
no
man
loses
his
real
estate
by
the
awakening
of
a
sleeping
title
and
if
this
could
happen
he
would
be
fully
reimbursed
by
the
county
in
our
world
some
titles
are
as
clear
as
mud
often
we
pay
a
large
sum
to
have
the
records
examined
and
even
then
a
purchaser
has
no
assurance
of
here
it
is
even
possible
to
buy
a
lot
build
a
home
and
five
or
fifty
years
afterward
have
it
sold
by
some
one
who
proves
a
prior
claim
on
the
land
no
such
foolishness
or
in
the
guise
of
legal
dignity
is
countenanced
in
the
whole
civil
system
of
this
sphere
is
superior
to
ours
a
person
who
violates
the
law
is
not
treated
to
free
boarding
and
lodging
in
a
well
heated
and
lighted
building
as
is
quite
prevalent
in
our
world
but
is
compelled
to
enter
profitable
labor
under
strict
surveillance
any
prisoner
becoming
rebellious
and
refusing
to
work
is
dealt
with
severely
if
he
is
still
insubordinate
he
is
placed
on
the
revolving
wheel
of
death
until
his
stubborn
will
is
broken
or
he
falls
fatigued
into
the
jaws
of
steel
this
convict
labor
does
not
compete
with
the
regular
ranks
of
honest
toil
the
main
work
of
criminals
is
farming
and
the
products
of
these
farms
support
not
only
the
criminals
but
their
families
as
well
what
is
produced
beyond
that
is
sold
at
market
price
and
the
proceeds
are
applied
to
current
expenses
of
the
county
in
our
world
the
honest
man
must
pay
to
support
the
dishonest
the
must
care
for
the
law
breaker
how
much
longer
this
will
continue
no
one
has
prophesied
the
manner
of
choosing
officials
in
is
both
new
and
surprising
all
the
officers
from
the
highest
to
lowest
are
chosen
by
lot
instead
of
by
popular
ballot
or
hereditary
claim
they
who
are
thus
elected
remain
in
office
during
competency
and
good
behavior
their
record
must
be
stainless
during
the
preceding
ten
years
they
must
have
been
graduated
from
the
law
department
of
the
public
schools
they
must
be
at
least
years
old
for
the
highest
officials
the
conditions
are
more
rigid
the
teachers
in
all
public
schools
are
selected
in
the
same
manner
from
among
the
number
who
apply
and
who
have
been
graduated
in
rank
high
enough
for
the
school
in
question
at
first
this
lot
system
seemed
very
foolish
to
me
indeed
bordering
upon
absurdity
but
the
more
i
studied
its
simplicity
and
observed
its
results
the
more
i
became
impressed
with
its
good
sense
and
efficiency
there
are
no
political
parties
fomenting
discord
in
a
country
under
a
spoils
system
no
upheavals
every
few
years
and
hilarious
campaigns
and
no
idiotic
caricatures
of
public
officials
to
work
unbridled
mischief
in
the
hearts
of
the
most
dangerous
citizens
chapter
ix
a
problem
in
political
economy
after
i
had
left
the
world
of
i
still
lingered
in
the
heavens
around
the
planet
and
examined
a
few
of
its
moons
while
enjoying
this
pleasing
diversion
i
learned
that
not
far
away
less
than
one
billion
miles
there
was
a
world
without
an
atmosphere
this
peculiar
condition
was
not
new
to
me
for
i
had
seen
during
my
journey
many
worlds
without
gaseous
air
i
would
not
have
gone
thither
had
it
not
been
for
an
unaccountable
desire
impelling
me
obedient
to
my
impulse
i
soon
found
myself
on
this
odd
planet
which
i
have
named
airess
i
at
once
observed
that
the
people
are
formed
without
nose
or
lungs
the
nose
is
substituted
by
an
opening
into
which
liquid
air
is
received
and
through
which
it
passes
to
a
bodily
reservoir
of
two
lobes
in
the
vicinity
of
the
heart
when
i
saw
how
these
people
were
obliged
to
fill
their
living
vessels
with
this
liquid
i
at
once
thought
of
the
manner
in
which
we
in
our
world
fill
our
lamps
with
oil
to
furnish
light
and
heat
now
it
is
true
that
nature
supplies
this
liquid
air
in
reasonable
abundance
and
no
doubt
all
the
people
would
have
been
happy
until
now
had
it
not
been
for
the
unjust
scheming
of
a
few
unprincipled
men
the
strange
story
of
the
air
problem
on
this
distant
world
is
so
similar
to
the
food
problem
of
ours
that
i
have
time
to
describe
it
briefly
there
were
certain
men
in
airess
shrewd
above
their
fellows
who
secretly
combined
to
secure
a
controlling
interest
in
all
the
land
producing
liquid
air
in
course
of
time
these
shrewd
schemers
who
are
known
as
monopolists
gathered
this
liquid
air
into
large
tanks
and
warehouses
and
put
an
exorbitant
price
upon
it
the
business
flourished
greatly
because
everybody
was
daily
in
need
of
liquid
air
the
many
sources
of
were
guarded
and
men
were
employed
to
carry
the
liquid
from
the
raw
springs
to
the
private
tanks
of
the
monopolists
not
long
after
this
when
the
monopolists
saw
that
they
controlled
all
the
liquid
air
of
the
country
they
had
rigid
laws
passed
forbidding
the
importation
of
air
from
any
other
country
then
when
all
preliminaries
were
arranged
the
magnates
raised
the
price
of
their
commodity
the
burden
fell
most
heavily
on
the
persons
of
limited
means
for
some
were
compelled
to
give
half
of
their
earnings
for
air
the
monopolists
grew
richer
and
richer
while
the
poor
became
still
poorer
until
a
cry
went
up
for
cheaper
living
then
the
magnates
decided
to
build
new
and
larger
storehouses
thus
giving
employment
to
the
large
army
of
impoverished
workmen
thus
did
the
poor
feel
very
grateful
for
the
privilege
of
earning
enough
to
satisfy
their
hungry
stomachs
with
the
larger
storehouses
now
in
operation
the
magnates
were
enabled
to
conduct
this
air
business
on
a
scale
more
economical
and
so
it
resulted
that
the
profits
of
their
business
were
constantly
increasing
many
who
were
unable
to
work
became
sorely
distressed
insomuch
that
some
died
raving
for
liquid
air
others
were
more
fortunate
and
were
helped
by
charitably
inclined
citizens
when
a
few
poor
comrades
clubbed
together
and
contributed
out
of
their
mites
then
the
magnates
sold
air
but
if
the
sufferers
had
no
money
they
could
have
no
air
a
growing
discontent
possessed
the
people
they
appealed
to
the
legislative
bodies
but
the
magnates
had
grown
so
immensely
wealthy
that
they
controlled
all
the
assemblies
and
gave
the
members
air
free
of
charge
an
act
of
kindness
indeed
so
the
law
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
the
cries
of
the
people
and
many
riots
followed
but
these
were
all
quelled
by
the
standing
army
which
was
also
supplied
with
free
air
for
the
good
service
they
were
capable
of
rendering
to
the
monopolists
the
multitude
of
laboring
people
could
do
as
they
chose
that
is
work
like
slaves
and
live
or
refuse
to
tolerate
the
monopoly
and
die

airess
many
were
the
pitiful
scenes
witnessed
in
all
parts
of
the
land
men
women
and
children
gathered
around
one
or
another
of
the
large
tanks
brimming
full
of
the
life
sustaining
liquid
it
was
to
see
children
with
mouths
dying
for
air
of
course
none
of
the
magnates
were
within
hearing
or
seeing
distance
the
tanks
were
in
charge
of
underlings
who
were
bound
to
give
no
air
except
for
the
exorbitant
market
price
this
state
of
affairs
continued
for
many
generations
nor
did
relief
come
until
one
named
agitator
went
forth
strongly
set
in
his
convictions
he
was
a
orator
a
lover
of
justice
one
who
believed
in
the
fatherhood
of
god
and
the
brotherhood
of
man
as
long
as
he
went
about
speaking
and
praying
the
monopolists
gave
no
heed
but
when
he
began
organizing
the
masses
into
sworn
legions
then
did
the
magnates
bestir
themselves
seeing
danger
in
the
gathering
clouds
of
humanity
what
shall
we
do
cried
they
one
to
another
bribe
agitator
suggested
one
a
happy
hit
cried
they
all
one
was
chosen
to
do
the
work
a
description
of
the
meeting
and
conversation
of
these
two
great
leaders
is
a
choice
bit
of
literature
of
the
world
of
airess
i
will
translate
it
as
nearly
as
possible
into
english
magnate
and
his
companion
met
agitator
three
hours
after
neither
one
had
ever
seen
the
other
before
and
naturally
agitator
did
not
suspect
the
purpose
for
which
magnate
had
come
we
are
here
said
magnate
to
place
into
your
hands
one
million
dollars
to
be
used
for
the
education
of
poor
children
we
have
confidence
in
your
judgment
and
integrity
and
if
you
will
accept
the
money
on
our
conditions
we
will
gladly
arrange
all
papers
and
place
the
money
at
your
disposal
a
magnanimous
offer
indeed
but
what
are
the
conditions
hurriedly
asked
the
blushing
agitator
the
conditions
are
easy
to
meet
you
are
to
train
and
appoint
and
give
your
influence
to
the
building
up
of
these
schools
you
are
to
spend
your
time
in
this
noble
work
and
receive
as
salary
ten
thousand
dollars
annually
of
course
you
will
be
glad
to
put
your
whole
heart
and
time
into
this
enterprise
and
encourage
all
workmen
to
show
their
appreciation
of
this
generous
movement
in
behalf
of
the
oppressed
but
what
would
become
of
my
other
great
work
asked
agitator
as
a
interrogation
point
covered
his
face
this
new
enterprise
will
solve
the
whole
question
is
it
not
true
that
ignorance
is
the
cause
of
nearly
all
the
discontent
in
the
world
if
you
scatter
the
clouds
of
ignorance
with
them
the
darkness
of
nearly
all
our
woes
will
fly
and
you
will
stand
at
the
head
of
a
new
race
educated
refined
and
capable
of
understanding
and
securing
their
rights
more
surely
and
more
intelligently
than
now
agitator
was
a
man
of
quick
mind
he
was
however
almost
caught
in
the
fine
network
spun
around
him
he
bowed
his
head
a
moment
in
quietness
there
is
a
tinge
of
truth
in
your
words
admitted
agitator
if
i
can
avoid
it
however
he
continued
the
people
now
living
will
not
suffer
for
a
whole
generation
in
hope
of
imaginary
relief
your
scheme
is
a
worthy
one
but
you
must
seek
elsewhere
for
a
leader
i
have
sworn
in
my
soul
to
bend
my
every
effort
to
break
the
strong
arm
of
the
monopoly
magnate
was
a
cool
man
and
held
his
dignity
in
a
pleasing
manner
he
carelessly
changed
his
attitude
and
spoke
with
decision
if
you
will
not
lead
this
educational
enterprise
the
whole
offer
will
be
withdrawn
and
it
will
be
advertised
to
the
world
that
the
leader
of
the
poor
people
has
refused
the
most
magnificent
offer
of
the
age
for
the
uplifting
of
the
masses
ah
quickly
replied
agitator
if
the
offer
be
sincere
why
should
it
go
by
default
on
my
simple
refusal
to
be
turned
from
my
present
course
let
some
other
one
better
qualified
than
i
attend
to
the
management
of
this
noble
cause
magnate
advanced
a
step
and
with
emphatic
gesture
gave
his
ultimatum
you
are
the
recognized
leader
of
the
masses
the
idol
of
all
the
poor
and
of
the
oppressed
in
you
the
very
persons
whom
we
hope
to
benefit
have
unbounded
confidence
and
naturally
you
are
the
only
man
who
can
make
wisest
and
most
efficient
use
of
this
large
sum
of
money
we
have
no
other
choice
and
i
ask
you
once
more
for
the
sake
of
suffering
humanity
to
accept
the
leadership
of
this
worthy
cause
which
will
do
more
for
the
people
than
all
other
reform
movements
combined
you
can
make
no
mistake
in
accepting
our
offer
this
is
the
only
right
thing
for
you
to
do
agitator
took
no
time
to
study
his
reply
his
words
were
born
on
the
occasion
for
the
occasion
he
spoke
with
marked
power
in
his
voice
and
fiery
electricity
in
his
eye
i
have
made
my
final
decision
i
am
married
to
my
reform
movement
and
seek
no
divorce
i
want
all
people
to
have
free
air
as
they
have
free
sunlight
i
am
determined
that
neither
favor
nor
force
neither
magnate
nor
money
shall
swerve
me
from
my
course
the
people
of
my
time
shall
see
their
liberty
or
i
shall
see
my
death
this
reply
of
agitator
is
most
memorable
it
is
quoted
more
than
the
famous
words
of
patrick
henry
of
our
world
give
me
liberty
or
give
me
death
agitator
pushed
his
cause
with
remarkable
skill
soon
his
movements
reached
such
proportions
that
great
men
courted
his
favor
the
masses
clung
to
him
with
truest
loyalty
he
took
full
advantage
of
the
situation
and
gained
control
of
the
legislative
bodies
then
followed
the
great
enactment
all
the
air
of
the
world
was
declared
to
be
free
and
any
one
attempting
to
buy
or
sell
this
natural
and
indispensable
product
was
guilty
of
a
misdemeanor
punishable
by
fines
and
heavy
bonds
the
celebration
of
this
victory
was
extreme
the
most
wonderful
jubilations
were
held
at
the
air
tanks
famous
speeches
were
made
and
the
tanks
were
sold
by
permission
of
their
owners
one
enthusiastic
person
bought
a
tank
declared
that
he
would
sell
it
in
small
pieces
for
relics
and
use
the
proceeds
for
educating
poor
children
the
scene
that
followed
beggars
description
everybody
knew
that
this
was
a
cut
at
magnate
and
the
buying
of
relics
was
carried
on
in
an
unprecedented
manner
the
amount
of
money
netted
by
this
sale
was
so
large
that
several
schools
were
erected
and
an
endowment
provided
for
their
maintenance
all
this
happened
long
ago
on
the
world
of
airess
but
the
memory
of
these
unusual
times
will
never
die
they
have
an
annual
day
of
celebration
much
resembling
in
its
festivities
our
fourth
of
july
the
most
peculiar
human
condition
of
airess
according
to
my
view
is
the
manner
in
which
these
people
sleep
they
do
not
lie
down
and
gradually
drift
into
unconsciousness
but
they
lie
motionless
and
still
retain
full
consciousness
the
rest
comes
from
the
quietness
of
the
bodily
members
it
is
not
even
possible
for
these
creatures
to
become
mentally
insensible
to
their
surroundings
except
by
an
accident
or
through
medical
treatment
i
was
most
impressed
however
as
i
learned
of
the
powerful
eyesight
which
these
people
enjoy
their
eyes
are
indeed
little
telescopes
capable
of
examining
heavenly
bodies
with
as
much
accuracy
as
we
are
enabled
to
do
with
the
aid
of
magnifying
glasses
then
comes
the
surprising
statement
that
these
same
people
have
never
invented
anything
similar
to
a
spy
glass
or
a
telescope
imagine
how
far
they
could
peer
into
the
depth
of
space
if
their
own
gifted
eyesight
were
augmented
by
good
magnifying
glasses
i
spent
a
little
longer
time
on
airess
than
on
some
other
planets
because
i
found
that
i
could
more
easily
understand
the
philosophy
of
their
attainments
the
last
moments
of
my
stay
were
spent
in
the
largest
structure
of
this
whole
world
the
central
building
of
education
from
this
structure
endless
lines
of
power
and
influence
are
maintained
all
through
the
territorial
divisions
of
airess
i
studied
this
unusual
plan
of
education
and
viewed
with
delight
the
ponderous
portion
of
this
imposing
edifice
at
last
i
bid
farewell
to
all
these
mute
instructors
and
looking
skyward
fixed
my
mind
on
the
shores
of
another
world
chapter
x
floating
cities
almost
everyone
is
familiar
with
ursa
major
or
the
great
dipper
that
lies
in
such
bold
relief
in
the
region
of
the
northern
heavens
and
that
apparently
revolves
around
polaris
the
north
star
the
nearer
of
the
two
stars
that
help
to
form
this
famous
dipper
and
that
point
toward
polaris
is
called
dubhe
by
our
astronomers
this
star
and
its
interesting
solar
system
next
claimed
my
attention
from
earth
i
had
often
looked
with
admiring
wonder
at
the
starry
firmament
and
during
many
an
evening
i
had
drawn
the
imaginary
lines
from
star
to
star
outlining
the
great
dipper
commencing
with
the
end
of
the
handle
and
finishing
with
the
star
just
named
at
the
outer
edge
or
rim
as
i
came
near
to
dubhe
i
scanned
the
surrounding
skies
and
was
surprised
to
find
that
the
whole
semblance
of
my
dipper
was
lost
instead
of
lying
in
a
plane
these
stars
were
widely
separated
so
far
that
a
billion
miles
gives
no
fair
hint
of
the
distance
many
new
stars
previously
invisible
now
shone
in
great
glory
so
that
the
whole
celestial
field
presented
new
aspects
far
away
i
looked
toward
our
sun
it
sparkled
like
a
tiny
star
and
none
of
the
planets
of
our
solar
system
were
visible
i
paused
not
at
dubhe
but
sped
onward
to
one
of
the
busy
worlds
that
revolve
around
it
which
i
shall
call
plasden
this
is
two
hundred
times
as
large
as
our
world
and
slin
covers
of
its
surface
slin
is
a
liquid
much
resembling
water
and
serves
practically
the
same
purpose
plasden
is
truly
a
wonderful
water
world
its
inhabitants
are
not
confined
to
the
life
like
those
found
in
stazza
neither
are
they
strictly
compelled
to
remain
in
the
atmosphere
although
that
is
their
normal
condition
the
plasdenites
can
sustain
life
under
water
but
only
with
discomfort
they
have
three
times
as
many
ribs
as
we
possess
and
between
them
are
openings
into
which
air
or
water
enters
for
life
sustentation
these
flabby
ribs
slowly
rise
and
fall
continuously
and
involuntarily
i
would
describe
the
upper
portion
of
their
bodies
but
they
would
seem
so
contrary
to
our
ideas
of
beauty
that
i
will
pass
on
by
saying
that
to
my
eye
now
trained
in
the
larger
school
of
interstellar
harmonies
these
plasdenites
are
lovely
and
lovable
human
creatures
they
have
reached
a
high
state
of
civilization
and
being
gifted
with
the
spirit
life
they
are
still
forging
ahead
toward
perfection
unconsciously
competing
with
their
fellow
spirits
in
millions
of
worlds
plasden
is
an
old
planet
human
beings
have
lived
thereon
for
thirty
thousand
years
and
consequently
ages
ago
the
land
area
became
so
densely
populated
that
there
was
not
enough
room
to
accommodate
the
increasing
millions
this
perplexing
problem
was
solved
in
a
very
peculiar
manner
by
an
experiment
on
the
part
of
a
wealthy
plasdenite
who
seven
thousand
years
ago
took
advantage
of
the
extremely
light
mineral
products
of
this
world
and
built
for
himself
a
floating
mansion
which
covered
about
ten
acres
according
to
our
measurements
this
fairy
palace
was
floated
on
the
great
oceans
from
one
continent
to
another
propelled
by
the
wind
and
controlled
by
a
series
of
motors
after
a
few
years
he
returned
to
his
native
shore
and
conceived
the
idea
of
building
around
his
palace
a
water
village
all
foundations
were
made
of
strong
substance
mixed
with
molten
granite
which
upon
hardening
formed
a
compound
of
marvelous
lightness
and
durability
with
painstaking
care
and
unceasing
energy
the
water
village
was
transformed
from
a
fanciful
dream
into
a
tangible
reality
and
in
process
of
time
one
section
after
another
was
added
until
a
veritable
city
floated
on
the
bosom
of
the
deep
but
this
is
only
a
brief
description
of
a
marvelous
accomplishment
i
did
not
pause
to
mention
the
factories
and
mills
that
were
attached
to
this
city
nor
have
i
told
you
that
in
less
than
one
thousand
years
after
this
first
water
city
was
finished
there
were
floating
on
the
oceans
of
plasden
no
less
than
two
hundred
cities
of
various
sizes
each
a
manufacturing
center
devoted
to
one
or
more
lines
of
industry
the
majority
of
these
cities
moved
in
harmony
in
a
course
requiring
about
one
year
or
four
hundred
of
our
days
to
complete
a
single
circuit
as
was
their
prototype
so
they
were
propelled
by
a
series
of
motors
and
a
splendid
sail
system
at
times
the
wind
did
the
greater
part
of
the
work
and
again
the
full
force
of
the
motors
was
required
let
me
ask
you
to
get
on
board
one
of
these
cities
and
take
one
journey
in
a
few
minutes
for
instance
take
one
of
the
vehicle
cities
composed
of
one
hundred
factory
buildings
and
three
thousand
dwellings
all
built
of
materials
the
city
is
now
in
the
harbor
of
a
great
port
and
all
the
merchantmen
who
live
nearest
to
this
port
have
been
informed
that
the
vehicle
city
would
arrive
about
midweek
and
remain
four
days
what
a
busy
time
follows
after
the
floating
city
is
fastened
to
its
moorings
inhabitants
go
on
solid
ground
to
do
their
trading
dealers
make
large
purchases
and
place
extensive
orders
it
should
be
stated
that
the
mail
and
telegraph
systems
between
the
continents
and
all
these
floating
cities
are
well
nigh
perfect
fast
lines
of
mail
steamers
follow
one
another
around
the
same
course
pursued
by
these
floating
cities
and
passengers
can
go
to
or
from
any
of
these
moving
abodes
to
any
part
of
any
continent
whenever
they
wish
so
that
if
a
dealer
wishes
a
vehicle
of
special
design
he
can
send
his
order
by
mail
to
any
one
of
the
six
vehicle
cities
and
have
it
completed
by
the
time
the
floating
city
arrives
at
his
port
if
the
community
receiving
the
order
can
not
complete
the
work
in
time
the
order
is
sent
with
one
of
the
mail
steamers
to
the
next
vehicle
city
in
line
the
massive
city
starts
its
journey
and
in
one
day
it
floats
to
the
coaling
stations
here
it
takes
on
board
an
ample
supply
of
fuel
and
proceeds
along
the
regular
course
making
no
stops
until
it
reaches
the
mineral
station
where
it
takes
a
new
supply
of
the
various
kinds
of
metals
necessary
for
manufacturing
and
for
all
other
purposes
then
perchance
it
passes
a
city
or
two
that
is
lying
in
dock
for
trade
purposes
the
next
stop
will
be
at
one
of
the
several
tropical
stations
where
a
fresh
supply
of
fruits
is
purchased
and
a
number
of
vehicles
sold
or
delivered
after
this
the
city
passes
several
apparel
cities
moored
to
an
immense
dock
taking
on
board
large
bales
of
a
substance
used
in
making
texture
so
continues
the
interesting
journey
along
a
safe
route
mapped
out
centuries
before
storms
arise
of
course
but
what
harm
can
they
do
except
to
send
the
ponderous
waves
dashing
against
the
bulwarks
of
the
city
and
rock
it
gently
all
of
which
becomes
so
familiar
that
no
one
thinks
of
these
things
as
serious
barriers
to
the
life
perhaps
in
one
tour
of
four
hundred
days
thirty
stops
are
made
you
may
wonder
how
these
huge
floats
are
stopped
and
started
this
is
accomplished
by
a
series
of
border
propellors
which
can
be
put
into
service
at
any
time
if
speed
is
desired
or
contrary
winds
are
encountered
these
cities
have
done
much
to
civilize
the
darker
races
of
plasden
the
manufacturing
floats
coming
into
contact
with
the
shores
of
all
lands
naturally
have
an
uplifting
influence
on
its
peoples
some
of
whom
go
on
board
to
learn
trades
the
latest
novelty
of
plasden
is
a
music
city
owned
by
one
man
and
built
most
beautifully
its
size
is
comparatively
small
and
it
is
equipped
with
motors
of
double
power
enabling
it
to
proceed
with
considerable
speed
as
compared
with
the
cumbersome
heavier
floats
this
city
is
built
for
business
as
well
as
for
pleasure
these
plasdenites
enjoy
an
invention
in
the
form
of
a
machine
that
renders
music
when
acted
upon
by
air
and
at
certain
times
also
by
water
it
is
inspiring
to
listen
to
these
siren
strains
as
the
music
city
passes
another
floating
abode
excursion
parties
go
on
this
music
city
and
remain
at
one
or
another
of
its
famous
hotels
as
long
as
they
wish
illustration
a
floating
palace
and
a
floating
city
the
most
refined
feature
of
this
water
life
is
seen
in
the
floating
mansions
of
which
there
are
many
thousands
these
are
built
in
such
a
manner
that
the
wildest
storms
of
the
ocean
can
do
no
more
than
set
the
mansion
a
rocking
for
the
structures
that
venture
far
away
from
shore
are
very
large
and
surrounded
by
many
acres
of
attachments
it
is
delightful
to
live
in
one
of
these
water
mansions
go
to
any
chosen
harbor
remain
as
long
as
desired
and
taking
your
choice
of
countries
dwell
among
the
icebergs
or
in
the
tropical
regions
people
of
delicate
health
can
shift
to
any
climate
and
change
location
as
often
as
desired
this
style
of
retired
life
is
now
the
most
popular
of
all
in
this
peculiar
world
of
plasden
the
educated
people
are
a
very
bright
class
they
have
made
great
progress
in
manufacturing
this
implies
a
long
list
of
notable
inventions
in
every
branch
of
industry
it
is
strange
that
these
brilliant
inventors
never
paid
attention
to
air
travel
however
they
have
perfected
submarine
navigation
to
a
nicety
that
would
be
teasing
to
the
infant
efforts
that
we
have
thus
far
made
the
people
of
this
far
away
orb
have
greatly
surpassed
us
in
controlling
and
utilizing
the
three
distinct
forces
which
are
quite
similar
to
electricity
and
these
are
the
wizard
forces
that
furnish
the
power
used
to
drive
the
motors
and
engines
not
only
of
the
floating
cities
but
also
of
the
fixed
abodes
by
a
comparative
study
i
ascertained
that
we
have
over
six
thousand
inventions
for
which
they
have
no
parallel
and
plasden
has
nearly
twenty
thousand
to
which
we
have
nothing
similar
what
an
inspiring
study
all
these
facts
furnished
but
my
space
forbids
enlargement
i
believe
however
that
if
our
world
remains
a
few
thousand
years
more
we
will
have
learned
more
secrets
than
the
experts
of
plasden
know
although
they
have
had
a
start
of
many
thousand
years
over
us
there
are
very
few
worlds
where
the
devotional
spirit
has
reached
a
higher
level
than
in
plasden
the
truths
of
the
creator
are
preached
and
practised
with
a
far
more
pleasing
result
than
is
prevalent
on
earth
satan
has
found
his
way
to
this
planet
and
has
organized
his
forces
into
sworn
legions
against
whom
the
armies
of
righteousness
are
waging
relentless
warfare
the
main
secret
of
plasden
high
morality
is
found
in
the
fact
that
the
civil
governments
insist
on
moral
laws
and
a
careful
observance
of
them
one
blushes
with
shame
at
the
looseness
and
laxity
with
which
the
greater
municipalities
of
our
earth
are
governed
and
all
this
under
the
shadow
of
our
schools
and
church
spires
centuries
ago
the
good
people
of
plasden
learned
how
to
when
they
desired
to
win
in
a
struggle
against
iniquity
i
would
give
my
if
i
could
transport
this
secret
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
it
effective
on
the
earth
in
our
world
we
have
before
us
a
most
humiliating
spectacle
if
an
effort
is
made
to
extirpate
some
form
of
sin
that
has
taken
audacious
root
in
the
soil
of
our
moral
life
one
reform
element
or
denomination
fights
with
the
other
until
the
hoe
is
so
broken
that
there
is
nothing
left
wherewith
to
dig
out
the
miserable
roots
of
the
obnoxious
weed
thus
do
we
spend
our
energies
opposing
one
another
instead
of
fighting
the
devil
o
for
the
plasden
power
of
unity
before
which
any
species
of
corruption
can
be
crushed
out
that
is
opposed
by
the
forces
of
righteousness
we
have
succeeded
to
a
bitter
extreme
in
getting
the
church
and
state
separated
from
each
other
so
far
that
the
latter
scarcely
ever
gets
a
glimpse
of
the
former
and
we
stand
by
priding
ourselves
in
the
absolute
divorce
then
we
have
also
succeeded
in
getting
the
different
creeds
separated
by
chasms
so
wide
that
it
is
impossible
to
make
a
combined
attack
against
a
common
foe
however
these
separations
between
sects
are
gradually
disappearing
and
over
the
lessening
gaps
the
hands
of
a
more
christian
fellowship
are
being
extended
the
devil
wiser
in
his
generation
than
the
children
of
light
long
ago
united
his
trained
forces
in
defense
of
his
iniquitous
schemes
and
thus
he
is
permitted
for
a
season
to
sit
on
the
throne
of
power
and
wield
his
black
wand
over
the
civil
realm
thereby
licensing
iniquity
protecting
vice
and
spreading
his
dark
designs
over
the
commonwealths
of
the
world
we
look
forward
to
the
time
when
the
moral
and
spiritual
forces
of
our
world
will
reach
the
plasden
unity
may
this
be
accomplished
without
struggling
along
for
another
century
chapter
xi
a
world
of
ideal
cities
after
i
had
finished
my
brief
stay
at
plasden
i
again
rose
high
in
air
and
looked
over
the
oceans
with
their
floating
cities
this
was
one
of
the
most
charming
views
i
ever
had
of
any
world
i
paid
a
passing
visit
to
a
few
worlds
where
human
life
had
never
risen
to
a
great
height
of
civilization
nor
can
i
forget
the
lessons
i
there
learned
of
the
power
of
sin
all
this
one
can
clearly
see
who
visits
the
three
worlds
lying
next
in
order
to
plasden
but
i
will
forbear
the
sad
and
sickening
recital
of
the
depth
to
which
a
world
is
carried
by
sin
when
once
it
gains
a
haughty
ascendency
the
next
orb
that
attracted
my
attention
also
lay
in
the
solar
system
of
dubhe
and
very
much
resembles
our
own
world
in
both
size
and
climate
the
people
who
are
not
half
our
stature
are
so
differently
formed
that
i
could
scarcely
believe
my
own
senses
a
description
of
them
would
appear
only
ludicrous
so
i
shall
content
myself
with
saying
that
they
are
refined
in
their
manners
and
highly
educated
in
all
branches
of
human
knowledge
which
does
not
imply
that
their
studies
are
identical
with
ours
i
was
surprised
at
the
splendid
arrangement
of
their
cities
and
the
sensible
laws
governing
them
one
can
scarcely
believe
that
we
are
guilty
of
so
much
lost
labor
in
the
management
of
our
cities
in
our
own
way
of
living
and
in
providing
for
our
families
until
he
sets
his
eyes
on
a
city
of
another
world
that
has
notably
distanced
us
in
this
respect
these
people
though
small
of
stature
are
endowed
with
powerful
muscular
systems
and
through
their
intelligence
they
have
become
masters
of
the
seas
and
of
the
land
for
the
forests
give
away
and
savage
tribes
fall
back
before
the
onward
march
of
the
conqueror
man
i
then
appeared
in
visible
form
and
walked
into
one
of
the
largest
cities
on
this
world
i
had
not
passed
of
the
way
toward
the
city
center
before
i
was
surrounded
by
a
curious
crowd
which
so
blocked
my
path
that
i
could
make
no
further
progress
you
may
imagine
their
surprise
to
see
a
giant
as
i
appeared
to
them
with
a
strangely
shaped
head
and
with
a
soft
flabby
skin
for
they
at
first
regarded
my
clothing
as
my
skin
no
one
could
conjecture
what
sort
of
an
animal
i
was
i
remained
mute
and
watched
the
rising
tide
of
excitement
before
anyone
could
venture
to
touch
me
i
saw
a
band
of
officers
in
march
hastening
toward
me
with
their
curiously
shaped
weapons
unfolded
i
stood
motionless
as
the
soldiers
surrounded
me
as
soon
as
the
circle
was
formed
the
leader
of
the
squad
stepped
toward
me
with
a
show
of
bravery
but
i
saw
that
he
secretly
trembled
it
was
his
duty
in
such
a
case
to
lay
hands
on
me
and
if
necessary
use
force
to
take
me
to
the
central
office
i
offered
no
resistance
and
went
as
i
was
directed
till
i
stood
in
the
odd
looking
room
where
all
offenders
of
their
law
are
taken
for
a
hearing
illustration
planet
of
dubhe
the
news
of
my
appearance
and
arrest
had
by
this
time
spread
to
all
parts
of
the
city
and
a
motley
crowd
were
gathering
but
only
a
small
portion
of
the
people
were
able
to
gain
entrance
into
the
building
where
i
had
been
taken
the
high
officials
and
educators
hearing
of
the
wonderful
giant
at
the
city
hall
hastened
thither
with
all
speed
then
i
saw
an
interesting
spectacle
as
these
higher
classes
of
people
arrived
the
lower
classes
were
compelled
to
leave
the
room
being
full
no
laborer
was
allowed
to
remain
if
a
person
of
nobility
wished
to
occupy
his
seat
this
peculiar
custom
or
law
applies
to
all
public
places
and
assemblies
in
a
short
time
all
the
lower
classes
were
compelled
to
leave
the
hall
to
make
room
for
the
unprecedented
rush
of
nobility
nothing
so
tempted
me
to
speak
as
when
i
saw
this
partial
rule
in
operation
during
all
this
gathering
the
officers
stood
in
a
circle
around
me
and
held
their
weapons
ready
for
instant
service
not
hearing
what
i
was
or
what
i
might
do
they
were
ordered
to
maintain
this
strict
attitude
every
eye
was
fastened
on
me
some
of
the
nobility
were
pale
with
fear
others
were
busy
inquiring
whence
i
came
and
where
i
had
been
captured
at
length
the
chief
official
made
a
gutteral
sound
this
must
have
been
a
call
for
order
and
the
signal
for
the
opening
of
the
court
for
at
once
the
wild
confusion
gave
way
to
order
as
much
as
could
be
expected
under
the
circumstances
the
brief
formalities
of
opening
the
court
were
ridiculous
to
me
this
being
done
all
official
attention
was
given
to
me
i
saw
that
everything
was
under
the
charge
of
this
presiding
official
he
first
ordered
that
i
should
be
bound
and
accordingly
my
hands
and
feet
were
tied
then
a
very
heavy
rope
was
fastened
to
my
body
and
i
was
tied
to
the
criminal
post
the
officers
were
then
released
and
retired
to
their
special
part
of
the
room
the
chief
then
stepped
toward
me
and
peered
into
my
face
with
a
puzzled
look
of
great
anxiety
i
returned
his
glances
calmly
but
uttered
not
a
word
there
was
a
breathless
suspense
as
the
chief
lifted
up
his
hands
touched
my
face
and
felt
my
mustache
and
whiskers
the
hair
was
perhaps
the
strangest
feature
of
my
whole
head
since
there
is
nothing
on
their
human
or
animal
species
that
resembles
hair
the
chief
then
called
for
a
certain
professor
who
was
an
expert
in
zoology
this
intelligent
man
quickly
came
to
my
side
and
at
the
request
of
the
chief
commenced
to
examine
me
carefully
my
manner
of
breathing
confused
him
most
of
all
he
watched
my
chest
rising
and
falling
and
my
sides
increasing
and
decreasing
with
every
breath
until
he
was
mystified
beyond
all
power
of
explanation
when
the
dignitaries
saw
that
i
could
be
touched
with
safety
numerous
messages
were
flying
to
the
chief
each
one
asking
for
the
privilege
of
a
closer
inspection
of
me
the
presiding
officer
was
and
firmly
followed
his
own
cause
he
waited
until
the
professor
had
finished
his
examination
and
was
prepared
to
report
whereupon
he
announced
to
the
bewildered
audience
that
heed
should
now
be
given
to
the
conclusion
of
the
zoologist
the
professor
mounted
a
elevation
from
which
all
expert
opinion
is
submitted
a
painful
silence
ensued
as
this
learned
man
proceeded
with
his
report
of
course
i
pretended
that
i
could
not
understand
their
language
and
that
i
was
oblivious
to
all
these
occurrences
but
you
may
be
assured
that
i
was
careful
not
to
miss
a
word
that
fell
from
the
lips
of
this
noted
specialist
who
conducted
himself
with
a
dignity
both
pleasing
and
fascinating
i
pronounce
this
creature
an
enigma
commenced
the
professor
as
he
pointed
his
bony
finger
toward
me
and
declare
him
to
be
the
strangest
problem
of
my
life
how
and
whence
and
why
he
came
to
us
are
all
alike
shrouded
in
impenetrable
mystery
this
perplexing
specimen
is
totally
different
from
any
species
of
our
animal
creation
he
resembles
a
man
more
closely
than
any
beast
however
he
can
not
belong
to
any
family
of
our
world
for
he
is
possessed
with
bodily
functions
unknown
to
us
his
clothes
are
not
the
result
of
any
natural
growth
and
are
far
beyond
our
finest
manufacture
each
piece
of
his
apparel
gives
positive
evidence
that
it
was
made
with
hands
more
skillful
than
ours
the
most
pleasing
part
of
this
perplexity
is
the
face
which
bears
indisputable
marks
of
intelligence
it
would
be
eminently
satisfying
to
us
if
we
could
communicate
with
him
and
receive
some
light
on
this
living
marvel
he
quickly
stepped
from
the
throne
and
the
chief
then
invited
four
philosophers
to
examine
me
conjointly
they
hurriedly
responded
to
the
invitation
for
they
were
delighted
at
the
honor
and
privilege
conferred
upon
them
what
a
peculiar
experience
followed
four
men
touched
my
hands
and
ankles
my
arms
and
limbs
and
more
particularly
every
piece
of
my
apparel
accidentally
one
found
my
purse
but
could
not
open
it
as
he
was
faithfully
pursuing
his
task
i
felt
that
the
time
had
come
for
me
to
speak
twist
at
the
two
knobs
i
said
in
their
vernacular
if
lightning
had
struck
into
that
room
it
would
not
have
caused
more
consternation
the
four
philosophers
fell
to
the
floor
the
chief
was
terrified
the
audience
looked
on
in
abject
terror
while
the
officers
rushed
from
their
post
with
drawn
weapons
all
this
occurred
instantly
and
i
realized
that
my
words
never
before
had
such
an
effect
in
a
moment
the
chief
was
at
my
side
and
looking
into
my
face
exclaimed
who
are
you
and
why
have
you
remained
silent
i
am
a
human
being
i
replied
from
what
part
of
our
world
i
was
not
born
on
this
world
on
what
world
then
he
further
asked
with
increasing
surprise
on
a
world
called
earth
that
revolves
around
a
star
called
sun
as
i
was
answering
these
questions
many
wild
sensations
were
sweeping
over
the
hearts
of
the
assembled
nobility
how
came
you
to
our
world
continued
the
chief
with
abated
breath
on
wings
invisible
for
what
purpose
came
you
hither
to
see
your
manner
of
life
will
you
stay
with
us
forever
i
can
not
have
you
come
to
harm
us
not
in
the
least
the
chief
in
a
high
state
of
excitement
ordered
that
i
should
be
unbound
i
smiled
and
said
that
i
would
spare
them
that
trouble
i
snapped
the
bands
with
such
ease
that
a
new
fear
possessed
all
of
those
around
me
i
then
gave
them
positive
assurance
that
i
would
harm
no
one
and
urged
that
all
should
be
silent
as
i
wished
to
speak
a
few
words
to
them
never
before
had
i
a
more
attentive
audience
i
addressed
them
in
a
natural
manner
informing
them
that
i
desired
to
become
familiar
with
a
few
of
their
forms
and
customs
of
life
i
then
proceeded
to
give
them
a
description
of
the
world
whence
i
had
come
my
audience
became
enthusiastic
and
i
decided
to
cease
speaking
the
chief
although
greatly
agitated
still
kept
his
hand
on
the
throttle
of
the
occasion
he
waved
the
surging
crowd
back
demanded
order
and
at
once
sent
his
arrowed
questions
at
me
again
are
you
not
a
god
cried
he
i
am
only
human
how
could
you
have
such
power
as
to
reach
our
world
that
i
can
not
explain
how
many
people
live
on
your
world
one
and
billion
i
answered
are
they
all
i
answered
that
i
was
pained
to
inform
them
that
many
of
our
inhabitants
are
wicked
my
listeners
were
still
incredulous
as
to
my
identity
they
were
positive
that
i
was
a
visiting
spirit
on
a
mission
of
evil
or
good
and
they
urged
that
i
should
disclose
the
purpose
of
my
commission
i
my
past
utterances
and
turning
to
the
chief
more
directly
i
informed
him
that
he
would
see
me
no
more
then
without
pausing
another
moment
i
vanished
as
i
went
i
looked
backward
to
see
the
mystified
countenances
of
all
who
were
in
the
room
and
then
proceeded
to
visit
the
surrounding
city
to
examine
the
system
under
which
it
is
governed
i
found
that
the
bulk
of
the
trade
is
controlled
by
the
city
one
class
of
goods
being
kept
at
one
place
in
suitable
store
houses
the
city
owns
a
full
line
of
vehicles
resembling
our
automobiles
these
are
very
spacious
each
one
is
supplied
with
certain
lines
of
merchandise
and
passes
over
an
unalterable
rail
route
at
its
own
fixed
period
thus
all
parts
of
the
city
are
reached
with
the
necessaries
of
life
those
who
prefer
can
go
to
the
trade
centers
but
no
special
orders
are
delivered
except
by
the
regular
cars
and
at
the
regular
time
for
instance
one
can
go
to
the
trade
centers
for
meats
and
vegetables
and
purchase
what
he
wishes
or
give
his
order
at
the
time
corresponding
to
six
of
our
time
in
the
morning
the
meat
and
vegetable
cars
start
on
their
respective
routes
while
the
trade
centers
are
open
for
personal
callers
marketing
goes
on
at
the
market
center
while
the
cars
are
selling
throughout
the
city
at
nine
the
delivery
cars
leave
the
trade
centers
similar
to
the
manner
of
our
world
each
home
is
numbered
in
such
a
way
that
no
two
houses
have
the
same
designation
by
this
arrangement
the
delivery
of
goods
is
facilitated
everything
in
this
busy
metropolis
goes
like
clock
work
and
everybody
knows
the
schedule
which
is
simple
enough
to
be
understood
almost
at
a
glance
all
the
trade
centers
lie
along
the
freight
and
passenger
railroad
this
saves
a
tremendous
amount
of
labor
for
the
goods
are
all
transferred
directly
from
the
cars
to
the
there
is
no
fire
department
for
there
is
no
need
of
one
it
appears
that
only
a
few
worlds
in
the
universe
use
inflammable
materials
for
structural
purposes
and
we
are
one
of
them
there
is
a
finance
department
and
a
law
department
although
i
can
not
give
space
for
their
description
the
sanitary
and
police
departments
are
under
systems
absolutely
different
from
any
that
are
known
in
our
world
their
sanitary
methods
are
no
more
effective
than
ours
perhaps
less
so
but
the
police
department
is
greatly
superior
this
is
largely
due
to
the
fact
that
this
city
has
a
department
gloriously
ahead
of
any
city
in
which
i
have
ever
lived
this
department
is
called
the
moral
department
it
is
managed
by
men
and
women
of
whom
are
selected
annually
from
a
list
of
nominees
each
church
meeting
certain
requirements
is
entitled
to
make
one
nomination
the
seven
of
these
nominees
receiving
the
largest
number
of
votes
are
elected
for
three
years
this
moral
department
is
no
mincing
and
begging
institution
it
has
at
its
disposal
the
entire
military
battery
no
mayor
holds
a
whip
handle
over
it
i
must
confess
i
was
happy
as
i
witnessed
the
blessed
effect
of
this
moral
department
all
evil
is
not
extirpated
neither
is
all
lawlessness
overcome
but
there
is
no
brazen
iniquity
no
public
immorality
and
heartless
brutality
such
as
is
seen
on
every
hand
in
one
of
our
larger
municipalities
chapter
xii
a
world
enjoying
its
millennium
what
expansive
views
of
creation
were
afforded
me
in
my
universal
journey
i
saw
all
conceivable
types
of
human
life
many
of
which
i
alone
could
never
have
conceived
with
a
happy
soul
i
alighted
on
another
world
in
the
solar
system
of
dubhe
where
sin
had
been
banished
and
the
believers
or
children
of
god
were
passing
through
a
period
of
time
which
we
would
call
the
millennium
a
wide
contrast
was
now
presented
to
my
view
i
had
seen
world
after
world
in
the
tribulation
of
sin
now
i
had
come
to
one
under
the
sway
of
righteousness
and
i
wish
that
i
had
power
to
describe
what
i
saw
and
experienced
i
suddenly
thought
of
the
queen
of
sheba
who
upon
seeing
the
greatness
of
solomon
wisdom
exclaimed
behold
the
half
was
not
told
me
i
had
often
imagined
what
the
condition
of
our
world
would
be
when
it
smiles
under
the
light
of
the
millennium
but
i
minimized
the
glory
that
is
yet
to
come
to
us
judging
by
what
i
saw
on
this
delightfully
charming
planet
i
have
no
assurance
however
that
the
coming
millennium
of
our
world
will
be
altogether
similar
to
the
one
i
saw
this
glorious
millennium
was
ushered
in
about
six
hundred
years
ago
and
i
readily
learned
the
general
particulars
of
its
commencement
the
world
had
been
very
wicked
prior
to
the
dawn
of
this
new
age
the
majority
of
the
people
disregarded
all
spiritual
truths
causing
the
darkness
of
sin
to
hang
like
a
heavy
pall
over
the
nations
of
this
planet
there
were
earnest
devotees
who
lived
in
the
light
and
love
of
god
and
who
preached
and
pleaded
with
the
thoughtless
and
the
indifferent
notwithstanding
all
the
efforts
put
forth
on
the
part
of
the
righteous
the
generations
of
this
distant
world
became
more
and
more
wicked
until
the
millennial
dawn
in
the
fullness
of
time
the
millennium
was
ushered
in
by
the
appearance
of
the
chief
angel
who
came
with
several
hundred
thousand
attending
spirits
at
the
approach
of
these
celestial
regiments
the
atmosphere
far
above
the
planet
was
darkened
by
ominous
clouds
through
which
the
approaching
legions
shone
with
unearthly
brightness
all
this
occurred
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
even
before
the
busy
millions
could
look
upward
then
the
chief
angel
and
his
magnificent
host
circled
in
the
air
singing
the
resurrection
song
which
was
augmented
by
ten
thousand
trumpeters
while
the
forked
and
sheet
lightnings
flashed
in
unison
with
the
imposing
waves
of
music
and
heavy
thunders
contributed
the
bass
intonations
the
celestial
choir
continued
during
one
revolution
of
the
planet
the
vast
throng
sang
in
the
air
as
the
planet
revolved
on
its
axis
as
each
section
of
the
globe
came
beneath
the
long
extended
line
of
melodious
angels
the
marvelous
change
took
place
for
that
section
the
sleeping
saints
came
forth
from
their
graves
and
with
the
living
saints
were
caught
up
into
the
air
this
continued
until
this
most
eventful
day
was
finished
the
scenes
that
occurred
with
the
ungodly
during
this
awful
day
beggar
all
description
so
much
so
that
i
shall
not
attempt
to
describe
the
remorseful
wails
of
horror
that
rent
the
air
only
to
be
drowned
by
the
choir
it
was
the
day
of
triumph
for
the
saints
and
their
ears
were
not
disturbed
by
the
cries
of
terror
nor
were
their
hearts
distracted
by
the
opening
of
the
earth
to
receive
the
wicked
as
the
saints
were
caught
up
the
wicked
fell
into
pits
and
have
not
been
seen
since
the
flames
that
issued
from
the
rending
globe
set
everything
on
fire
who
can
select
language
sufficiently
graphic
to
portray
such
a
lurid
dissolution
of
a
planet
and
the
gathering
of
the
faithful
quick
and
dead
thus
was
this
large
world
purified
by
fire
while
the
saints
were
gloriously
enraptured
after
the
fury
of
this
burning
was
passed
the
great
creator
of
the
universe
made
a
new
world
whereon
righteousness
dwelled
the
saints
became
the
possessors
and
rulers
of
this
whole
sphere
living
in
joy
and
peace
unprecedented
it
has
been
the
happiest
six
hundred
years
since
the
beginning
of
this
planet
how
long
this
period
will
continue
no
one
seems
to
know
and
but
few
are
conjecturing
for
each
soul
is
completely
happy
and
congenially
employed
the
time
will
come
however
when
this
blissful
period
will
be
at
an
end
only
to
give
way
to
a
state
of
existence
infinitely
greater
and
more
glorious
which
in
our
language
would
be
called
heaven
illustration
beginning
of
the
millennium
i
will
briefly
describe
a
few
characteristics
of
this
millennial
life
as
i
saw
it
and
as
it
is
now
existing
the
saints
are
living
in
spiritual
bodies
they
are
not
cumbered
with
a
fleshy
body
and
are
capable
of
traveling
through
the
air
at
a
speed
far
beyond
that
attained
by
the
swiftest
winged
creature
of
any
world
in
the
whole
universe
their
spiritual
bodies
are
highly
organized
and
sensitive
to
a
fine
degree
at
will
they
are
capable
of
rendering
themselves
visible
or
invisible
as
we
comprehend
these
terms
as
the
perfectly
formed
flower
blushing
in
its
wealth
of
color
is
called
beautiful
so
we
would
designate
these
symmetrical
moving
in
the
glory
of
their
higher
endowment
and
shaded
with
the
living
tints
of
heaven
these
inhabitants
know
nothing
of
fatigue
their
strength
of
body
and
vitality
of
mind
are
unabating
what
a
contrast
between
the
creatures
of
our
earth
and
those
of
the
millennial
world
on
whom
the
passing
of
centuries
has
no
ill
effect
there
is
nothing
on
this
purified
world
to
generate
disease
hence
these
favored
people
never
suffer
any
pain
of
body
or
of
mind
the
long
line
of
has
all
vanished
from
this
redeemed
planet
and
the
atmosphere
is
all
aglow
with
the
mellowed
light
of
peace
and
love
jealousy
and
all
kindred
feelings
are
unknown
these
roots
were
all
destroyed
by
the
fire
at
the
beginning
of
the
millennium
no
one
can
imagine
how
enrapturing
life
is
in
the
absence
of
stings
of
malice
and
thorns
of
envy
the
social
and
spiritual
relationships
are
all
harmoniously
blended
no
one
feels
himself
beneath
or
above
another
and
no
one
feels
embarrassed
in
the
presence
of
a
superior
human
intelligence
thus
it
follows
that
the
fellowship
is
inexpressibly
sweet
you
can
only
imagine
the
dignity
and
glory
one
must
feel
as
he
mingles
with
the
righteous
dead
of
all
ages
and
gathers
from
them
a
glimpse
of
the
trials
and
triumphs
of
ten
thousand
years
under
the
old
reign
some
of
the
spirits
are
employed
in
dressing
and
keeping
the
gardens
in
which
grow
the
luxurious
food
on
which
redeemed
creatures
subsist
not
cereals
fruits
or
nuts
but
the
kind
that
creates
the
most
heavenly
sensations
as
it
wastes
away
in
perfume
at
the
will
of
the
user
the
nearest
imitation
of
this
food
ever
known
on
earth
was
eaten
by
christ
spirit
when
mary
broke
the
alabaster
box
of
ointment
on
his
head
some
spirits
of
this
millennial
life
seemed
to
be
more
rapturously
happy
than
the
others
i
learned
that
they
had
passed
through
the
darkness
of
continual
disappointments
or
suffered
under
the
of
matrimonial
union
others
fought
through
the
fires
of
persecution
and
torture
and
still
others
passed
through
martyrdom
for
their
sake
all
of
these
patiently
endured
all
hardships
leading
down
to
the
end
of
their
mortal
days
the
affinity
between
sexes
is
clearly
marked
no
love
but
pure
love
burns
on
the
altar
of
any
soul
and
any
one
who
wishes
may
stop
to
kindle
the
fires
or
warm
himself
thereat
there
is
no
bodily
contact
no
decay
no
weakening
this
love
is
enrapturing
uplifting
ever
drawing
the
lover
and
the
loved
nearer
to
the
fountain
in
language
most
intelligible
to
us
i
would
say
that
the
intercourse
between
sexes
is
one
of
refined
telepathy
by
thought
transmission
a
more
charming
than
the
low
plane
of
intercourse
in
the
flesh
life
with
none
of
its
attendant
weakening
results
this
strange
felicity
is
as
indescribable
as
it
is
glorious
each
nature
seeks
its
real
complement
and
enjoys
the
most
absolute
liberty
for
there
is
not
a
single
barrier
to
prevent
it
as
no
one
desires
to
do
wrong
this
most
inviting
life
had
its
charms
for
me
but
i
well
knew
that
i
could
not
tarry
i
lingered
at
a
thousand
fountains
to
catch
the
spray
and
studied
as
far
as
i
possibly
could
the
faces
of
these
favored
creatures
the
whole
vegetable
world
is
a
long
extended
floral
garden
where
formerly
deserts
lay
waste
and
wild
now
the
blooming
roses
and
expansive
lawns
can
be
seen
is
it
possible
to
picture
to
your
eye
a
line
of
lofty
mountains
whose
sides
are
dressed
in
living
colors
and
trimmed
with
rare
flowers
if
you
can
not
paint
this
picture
then
you
must
not
endeavor
to
form
the
faintest
conception
of
the
natural
features
of
this
millennial
world
being
still
filled
with
the
lingering
memories
of
this
happy
sphere
and
looking
forward
to
the
coming
golden
age
of
our
own
world
i
read
with
pleasure
a
few
stanzas
contemplating
christ
second
coming
a
song
of
his
coming
see
the
virgins
at
midnight
yearning
to
behold
the
face
of
the
groom
their
lamps
are
all
trimmed
and
burning
as
they
peer
through
the
misty
gloom
he
will
come
is
the
shout
of
voices
which
have
sung
in
a
thousand
ways
for
the
heart
of
the
saint
rejoices
at
the
thought
of
the
coming
days
when
the
war
of
creeds
will
be
over
and
our
king
descends
from
above
only
they
shall
witness
his
crowning
who
have
lived
in
the
light
of
love
then
the
christ
shall
reign
in
his
glory
on
the
throne
of
his
sovereign
might
and
the
theme
of
redemption
story
will
be
sung
with
perfect
delight
and
our
minds
will
dazzle
with
brightness
as
our
thoughts
forever
aspire
for
a
mantle
of
perfect
whiteness
shall
cover
the
youth
and
the
sire
then
we
know
that
none
will
be
jealous
and
no
one
will
envy
our
lot
for
against
the
one
who
is
zealous
not
a
soul
will
contrive
or
plot
and
our
actions
will
chime
in
pleasure
all
refined
from
malice
and
sting
we
shall
all
reach
the
perfect
measure
in
the
reign
of
this
conquering
king
we
will
have
everything
we
can
use
in
those
beautiful
realms
of
light
there
the
people
will
do
as
they
choose
for
each
one
will
choose
to
do
right
we
will
sail
through
the
seas
of
beauty
and
return
to
the
shores
we
please
far
away
from
the
callings
of
duty
in
the
shade
of
undying
trees
all
the
riches
of
christ
will
be
ours
is
a
wealth
without
guilt
or
pain
there
will
be
no
of
powers
nor
the
marks
of
official
stain
as
i
look
from
this
earthly
station
i
exclaim
again
and
again
o
what
an
eternal
vacation
come
quickly
lord
jesus

chapter
xiii
a
world
of
high
medical
knowledge
i
spent
a
long
and
profitable
season
in
the
vicinity
of
the
great
dipper
witnessing
the
almost
infinite
variations
of
human
life
as
found
from
world
to
world
and
looking
upon
the
wild
wastes
of
the
many
planets
that
are
not
inhabited
finally
i
again
spread
my
swift
wings
reached
the
beautiful
star
arcturus
and
noticed
among
the
worlds
that
revolve
around
it
a
few
that
are
sinless
i
was
tempted
to
pause
at
one
or
another
of
these
exceptional
stations
but
i
knew
that
i
could
not
tarry
until
i
had
reached
the
far
distant
constellation
of
scorpio
in
this
wide
flight
i
traveled
a
distance
so
great
that
i
will
not
weary
the
mind
with
mentioning
the
trillions
of
miles
now
i
was
in
the
direct
path
of
the
milky
way
and
my
imagination
staggered
as
i
saw
the
endlessness
of
stars
and
solar
systems
as
far
out
beyond
me
as
my
assisted
eyes
could
reach
the
star
at
which
i
arrived
is
one
of
the
largest
suns
that
blaze
in
the
depths
of
immensity
it
is
so
wonderfully
great
that
if
twelve
hundred
million
worlds
as
large
as
ours
were
all
crushed
into
one
great
ball
it
would
not
make
one
sphere
as
immense
as
this
star
or
sun
around
which
revolve
about
five
hundred
worlds
or
planets
many
of
which
are
greater
than
our
jupiter
with
abounding
interest
i
visited
all
the
inhabited
worlds
of
this
vast
system
how
long
it
took
i
have
no
way
of
knowing
i
did
not
count
time
by
hours
or
heart
throbs
for
i
was
so
wrapt
in
my
observations
that
all
else
was
as
nothing
to
me
some
of
these
worlds
sustain
a
low
order
of
human
creatures
while
on
others
there
are
races
that
have
reached
a
high
degree
in
the
scale
of
advancement
of
these
five
hundred
worlds
nearly
are
barren
of
all
life
and
of
those
that
are
inhabited
some
twenty
are
sinless
worlds
and
thirty
are
now
passing
through
an
intermediate
period
between
the
probationary
life
and
the
final
judgment
a
period
toward
which
we
are
anxiously
looking
and
which
we
designate
as
the
millennium
of
all
this
ponderous
solar
system
there
is
one
world
that
excels
all
the
others
in
its
medical
attainments
and
of
this
one
first
i
will
give
a
flying
notice
i
have
named
this
world
it
is
fifty
times
as
large
as
our
earth
and
of
greater
specific
gravity
its
human
creatures
are
delightfully
formed
and
are
in
ruddy
health
and
refined
happiness
in
shape
these
differ
somewhat
from
us
but
long
before
i
had
reached
this
planet
i
learned
something
of
the
universal
standards
of
symmetry
and
ascertained
that
creatures
could
be
beautiful
without
resembling
us
whatever
here
i
found
four
billions
of
people
and
there
is
room
for
twenty
billions
more
so
if
you
are
in
ill
health
and
have
run
the
round
of
our
medical
fraternity
without
success
i
would
advise
you
to
go
to
if
you
know
how
to
reach
it
these
are
almost
three
times
our
size
and
they
are
subject
to
most
of
our
ills
and
many
more
from
an
early
date
the
head
government
of
this
world
paid
particular
attention
to
hygiene
keeping
all
medical
work
under
its
own
care
the
government
controls
the
whole
field
of
medical
science
just
as
we
do
the
department
there
are
no
conflicting
schools
of
medicines
such
as
allopathic
homeopathic
hydropathic
eclectic
and
osteopathic
the
government
gives
handsome
rewards
to
any
one
who
furnishes
a
new
discovery
or
gives
additional
light
everything
is
duly
tested
and
proved
to
be
a
success
by
a
corps
of
experts
before
it
is
given
to
the
practicing
fraternity
the
government
holds
certain
rights
in
experimenting
that
no
physician
or
medical
school
would
think
of
having
in
our
world
the
government
medical
schools
of
are
marvels
indeed
nothing
is
spared
that
money
or
talent
can
furnish
the
full
graduates
of
these
schools
are
only
the
survival
of
the
fittest
others
take
a
secondary
degree
and
can
act
as
assistants
or
retire
from
the
list
the
government
has
a
series
of
institutions
that
do
a
work
similar
to
our
hospitals
and
have
a
corps
of
full
graduates
supplying
the
stations
this
entire
system
is
so
arranged
that
every
family
or
individual
receives
all
necessary
treatment
free
the
cost
of
carrying
on
this
vast
system
is
one
of
the
items
of
national
expense
i
will
now
mention
some
of
the
medical
achievements
of
these
when
a
physician
suspects
that
the
blood
is
poisoned
he
at
once
proceeds
to
a
chemical
analysis
and
if
certain
kinds
of
poison
are
found
the
blood
is
filtered
by
the
use
of
a
fine
instrument
a
blood
vessel
is
exposed
and
cut
and
the
two
ends
fastened
to
the
delicate
filter
thus
the
blood
is
cleansed
by
passing
through
this
instrument
those
acquainted
with
the
manner
in
which
the
blood
circulates
can
readily
see
how
all
the
blood
of
the
body
can
be
reached
in
a
short
time
this
method
is
very
successful
in
the
treatment
of
all
bites
of
poisonous
insects
and
reptiles
and
all
types
of
hydrophobia
which
are
more
numerous
in
than
in
our
world
there
are
no
patent
medicines
in
the
few
medicines
they
have
are
manufactured
only
by
government
authority
and
everybody
receives
the
purest
that
can
be
compounded
no
distinction
being
made
between
rich
and
poor
one
thousand
years
ago
the
medical
aspects
of
were
similar
to
those
which
are
seen
in
our
world
people
were
compelled
to
take
all
manner
of
poisons
and
opiates
even
from
skilled
hands
but
in
those
days
of
darkness
and
misery
are
past
and
the
people
enjoy
the
benefit
of
a
medical
skill
one
thousand
years
ahead
of
us
they
look
back
to
the
practice
of
the
old
physicians
with
ludicrous
feelings
just
as
we
do
when
reading
the
prescriptions
that
were
used
in
the
first
century
of
our
dispensation
we
call
your
attention
to
some
of
the
antiquated
remedies
of
our
world
as
related
by
geike
and
copied
from
a
medical
journal
of
our
own
country
following
is
a
list
ashes
of
wolf
skull
stag
horn
the
heads
of
mice
the
eyes
of
crabs
owl
brains
liver
of
frogs
viper
fat
grasshoppers
bats
these
supplied
the
alkalis
which
were
prescribed
physicians
were
accustomed
to
order
doses
of
the
gall
of
wild
swine
it
is
presumed
the
tame
hog
was
not
sufficiently
efficacious
there
were
other
choice
prescriptions
such
as
horse
foam
woman
milk
laying
a
serpent
on
the
afflicted
part
urine
of
cows
bear
fat
still
recommended
as
a
hair
restorative
juice
of
boiled
buck
horn
etc
for
colic
powdered
teeth
dung
of
swine
asses
kidneys
mice
excretion
made
into
a
plaster
and
other
equally
vile
and
unsavory
compounds
colds
in
the
head
were
cured
by
kissing
the
nose
of
a
mule
for
sore
throat
snail
slime
was
a
favorite
prescription
and
mouse
flesh
was
considered
excellent
for
disease
of
the
lungs
boiled
snails
and
powdered
bats
were
prescribed
for
intestinal
disorders
when
we
read
such
a
list
of
remedies
we
can
scarcely
believe
that
they
were
ever
popular
but
according
to
the
history
of
the
time
will
come
when
many
of
our
present
medicines
will
be
out
of
date
and
only
mentioned
in
the
old
medical
works
the
people
of
have
suffered
in
past
ages
innumerable
woes
on
account
of
intemperance
alcohol
is
unknown
to
them
but
they
have
had
a
year
battle
against
three
liquids
that
affect
them
as
opium
affects
us
strange
to
say
that
these
terrible
liquids
were
the
bases
of
many
of
their
medicines
just
like
the
anodyne
medicines
of
our
present
day
thus
in
the
old
kinds
of
medicines
created
many
drunkards
since
the
dawn
of
the
brighter
age
a
strict
law
prevails
regarding
the
use
of
all
narcotics
in
medicines
then
came
gradually
into
use
the
many
methods
of
treating
disease
without
medicine
except
the
materials
used
to
sustain
life
regularly
being
interested
in
these
things
i
examined
more
closely
into
their
past
medical
history
and
saw
more
clearly
the
present
folly
of
a
certain
part
of
our
medicinal
practice
how
we
are
struggling
with
alcohol
especially
as
found
in
so
many
of
our
patent
medicines
and
how
helpless
we
are
in
trying
to
abolish
the
sale
of
these
medicines
by
reason
of
our
unbounded
liberty
in
our
world
a
man
may
concoct
any
alcoholic
medicine
and
sell
it
without
liquor
license
for
people
become
verily
mad
for
the
bottled
stuff
our
nation
may
some
day
become
wise
enough
to
keep
its
own
hand
on
the
business
that
is
determining
the
health
and
happiness
of
millions
of
its
inhabitants
but
let
me
cease
this
digression
and
get
back
once
more
to
one
of
the
most
noted
medical
achievements
on
this
world
consists
in
the
manner
of
rendering
a
person
unconscious
of
pain
the
anatomy
of
a
is
in
general
the
same
as
our
anatomy
their
bones
are
arranged
a
little
differently
and
the
sections
of
the
backbone
have
a
quite
different
formation
when
a
surgeon
of
that
world
wishes
to
perform
an
operation
and
therefore
render
the
patient
unconscious
he
presses
the
tough
cartilagenous
part
of
a
section
of
the
backbone
with
a
screw
device
fastened
to
the
body
of
the
patient
this
simple
act
renders
the
spinal
cord
insensitive
which
condition
may
be
maintained
for
hours
without
injuring
the
patient
of
course
any
point
above
the
screw
device
is
sensitive
and
for
this
reason
it
is
more
difficult
to
render
a
person
unconscious
in
the
parts
about
the
head
many
ages
ago
the
world
of
microbes
was
laid
bare
but
not
before
these
people
were
masters
of
the
microscope
or
an
instrument
serving
the
same
purposes
although
formed
on
a
partly
different
principle
these
have
brought
to
light
the
numerous
varieties
of
parasite
broods
that
cause
fermentations
and
diseases
both
infectious
and
otherwise
a
diseased
body
is
looked
upon
as
being
in
possession
of
a
certain
brood
of
microbes
which
are
destroyed
either
by
the
blood
filter
or
the
vaccine
bath
or
injection
i
know
no
better
name
by
which
to
call
it
a
few
diseases
are
treated
by
doses
of
medicines
given
in
a
manner
similar
to
the
prescription
system
of
our
country
the
food
treatment
is
also
very
popular
in
this
is
merely
a
hygienic
selection
of
foods
given
to
people
of
declining
health
instead
of
having
them
swallow
ten
or
twenty
dollars
worth
of
strong
medicines
abnormal
appetites
crave
for
a
class
of
foods
injurious
to
the
system
in
they
have
discovered
a
novel
method
of
turning
the
diseased
appetite
from
its
cravings
toward
the
things
needed
by
the
system
in
performing
operations
the
experts
of
have
reached
a
marvelous
degree
of
perfection
they
have
learned
to
make
a
false
eye
so
that
one
can
see
with
it
it
took
three
and
thousand
years
of
continual
experimenting
on
this
delicate
creation
before
it
was
pronounced
satisfactory
the
false
eye
is
not
of
flesh
but
one
of
manufacture
it
is
placed
in
sensitive
connection
with
the
optic
nerve
on
which
images
are
thrown
by
the
delicate
mechanism
of
the
false
eye
the
sight
thus
obtained
is
almost
as
distinct
as
that
which
is
enjoyed
by
the
normal
eye
these
medical
wizards
also
make
artificial
ears
which
are
about
as
satisfactory
as
the
natural
ears
in
certain
lines
of
surgery
we
are
equal
to
these
but
we
can
not
register
with
them
in
the
whole
category
of
surgical
achievements
they
have
simply
distanced
us
by
five
hundred
years
that
is
i
believe
that
in
five
hundred
years
we
can
reach
the
fields
of
glory
which
they
now
occupy
think
of
laying
bare
a
human
lung
and
treating
it
with
a
special
preparation
for
extreme
cases
of
lung
diseases
and
also
treating
it
with
a
baking
for
department
cases
of
a
disease
similar
to
pneumonia
perhaps
the
most
wonderful
class
of
operations
is
performed
on
the
heart
and
the
brain
the
heart
is
laid
bare
under
a
sheet
of
thermal
rays
fatty
tissues
are
removed
and
other
obstructions
eradicated
during
the
regular
heart
beats
the
government
grants
certain
privileges
of
experimenting
on
her
lowest
class
of
criminals
and
it
is
well
nigh
incredible
what
has
been
accomplished
by
cerebrum
operations
certain
murderers
of
vile
propensities
have
been
so
changed
by
an
operation
on
the
cerebrum
that
they
have
no
power
of
recalling
their
past
life
and
are
incapable
of
uttering
an
oath
and
what
is
more
strange
they
are
intent
on
leading
an
upright
life
and
being
intensely
religious
withal
i
am
compelled
to
crowd
a
world
of
glorious
life
into
a
few
paragraphs
but
i
hope
that
i
have
given
such
as
will
be
for
our
good
chapter
xiv
a
world
of
low
life
when
one
witnesses
an
exhibition
he
must
of
necessity
look
upon
the
poorer
parts
of
it
this
was
my
experience
in
my
universal
journey
for
on
some
worlds
which
i
visited
i
found
that
human
civilization
was
at
a
low
ebb
one
of
the
most
notable
of
this
class
is
the
world
next
beyond
this
sphere
is
one
thousand
times
as
large
as
ours
and
the
beastly
creatures
that
inhabit
it
are
four
times
our
size
the
toilers
in
the
deep
valleys
of
mars
are
favorably
intelligent
compared
with
these
specimens
of
humanity
for
convenience
i
will
call
this
world
scum
its
people
are
so
constituted
that
their
two
arms
can
be
used
as
legs
so
it
is
quite
common
to
see
these
scumites
travel
over
their
planet
like
the
more
graceful
of
our
quadrupeds
their
walking
however
is
principally
after
our
fashion
and
they
can
change
about
at
pleasure
either
way
of
travel
seems
as
natural
as
the
other
when
they
walk
on
two
limbs
the
body
is
erect
presenting
a
stature
of
such
gigantic
proportions
as
to
a
representative
of
our
world
according
to
the
universal
standards
of
symmetry
these
giants
have
an
animal
beauty
that
is
anything
but
handsome
and
they
also
lack
those
facial
expressions
of
higher
intelligence
that
come
only
through
generations
of
cultured
thinking
their
health
is
quite
perfect
and
they
live
to
a
great
age
these
scumites
have
a
language
singularly
their
own
it
is
so
totally
different
from
any
of
our
conceptions
of
speech
that
i
can
scarcely
find
words
to
describe
it
the
medium
of
conversation
is
the
notched
rod
it
is
about
twelve
feet
long
with
various
kinds
of
notches
cut
along
the
two
sides
such
a
stick
is
possessed
by
every
scumite
who
expects
to
hold
extended
or
descriptive
conversations
it
is
usually
held
by
a
skin
strung
around
the
neck
while
one
of
these
persons
is
talking
two
or
three
of
his
fingers
pass
from
notch
to
notch
along
the
rod
these
indentures
of
the
rod
represent
in
their
language
certain
kinds
of
sounds
and
are
used
to
assist
the
vocal
organs
in
expressing
the
more
intricate
combinations
of
ideas
naturally
the
listener
watches
the
fingers
more
than
the
mouth
it
is
amusing
to
see
a
scumite
busily
engaged
in
delivering
a
speech
to
a
few
of
his
fellow
creatures
it
would
remind
you
of
a
person
playing
a
fife
or
violin
without
producing
any
sound
the
children
of
scum
learn
this
rod
language
just
the
same
as
our
children
at
first
learn
to
speak
our
language
by
observation
and
practice
the
face
of
a
scumite
does
not
resemble
a
human
face
of
our
planet
the
mouth
and
jaws
are
at
right
angles
to
ours
and
this
arrangement
seems
to
be
just
as
convenient
to
these
scumites
as
the
formation
of
our
mouth
is
to
us
the
nose
lies
above
the
mouth
but
is
relatively
much
higher
its
point
coming
between
the
two
eyes
which
are
situated
more
toward
the
sides
of
the
head
the
startling
fact
about
this
world
is
that
at
one
time
in
its
past
history
fair
intelligence
reigned
on
a
few
parts
of
the
planet
these
intelligent
sections
were
working
their
way
upward
on
the
measureless
incline
of
progress
and
had
won
some
distinctions
in
their
sciences
as
well
as
their
religious
devotions
these
bright
spots
on
the
surface
of
this
large
orb
were
surrounded
with
large
black
patches
of
humanity
and
between
these
two
extremes
a
warfare
of
subjection
or
extermination
raged
without
any
hope
or
peace
the
educated
scumites
had
a
few
advantages
in
methods
of
war
but
with
all
this
they
were
not
able
to
withstand
the
vast
hordes
that
swept
down
upon
them
brute
force
won
the
battle
and
the
accumulated
light
of
four
thousand
years
flickered
until
it
was
no
more
it
was
a
fatal
day
for
scum
when
its
mad
inhabitants
blew
out
the
last
of
the
candles
that
had
promised
to
give
them
light
when
this
sad
and
blighting
victory
was
accomplished
these
uncivilized
tribes
rejoiced
more
hilariously
than
at
one
time
our
indians
rejoiced
when
celebrating
their
victories
in
the
wild
scalp
dances
thus
the
dark
shadows
fell
on
this
huge
world
the
captured
educated
classes
made
a
heroic
effort
to
continue
their
cultured
manners
and
religious
life
but
the
prejudice
against
them
and
their
ways
was
so
great
that
they
were
compelled
to
live
in
the
lower
strata
or
suffer
the
pain
of
death
in
process
of
time
the
wild
woods
flourished
where
once
the
temples
of
science
and
pure
religion
reared
their
imposing
pillars
what
can
we
expect
of
such
a
race
of
people
who
have
drifted
from
the
light
of
civilization
for
so
long
a
period
as
i
looked
at
their
customs
and
their
ways
i
was
reminded
of
a
garden
that
has
run
wild
here
and
there
i
could
see
traces
of
the
once
thrifty
life
now
almost
choked
out
by
the
overpowering
crop
of
weeds
gradually
the
people
became
worse
and
worse
sin
played
havoc
and
built
carnal
fires
around
which
these
children
of
men
gathered
sensuality
became
the
ruling
passion
and
in
less
than
five
hundred
years
of
our
time
the
last
family
observance
had
died
away
and
these
creatures
wallowed
in
the
quagmire
of
fleshly
lusts
compared
with
which
the
brute
life
of
our
world
is
highly
respectable
free
love
was
rampant
and
human
offspring
was
cared
for
by
mothers
or
at
least
by
such
as
were
willing
to
assume
the
task
no
one
was
supposed
to
know
who
was
his
father
i
saw
this
sad
and
sickening
spectacle
against
which
my
instincts
revolted
with
horror
it
is
true
that
if
man
is
left
totally
unbridled
he
sinks
to
a
depth
which
it
would
be
impossible
for
any
species
of
the
animal
creation
to
reach
as
i
continued
looking
on
this
low
life
with
its
horrors
too
numerous
and
too
dreadful
to
mention
my
thoughts
flew
back
to
the
world
whence
i
came
and
to
america
where
i
was
born
and
i
remembered
of
some
who
advocated
free
love
let
their
arms
be
withered
i
cried
rather
than
have
such
a
thistle
fasten
itself
in
the
soil
of
our
social
life
let
the
libertine
of
our
world
go
to
the
world
of
scum
where
he
belongs
or
rise
to
the
dignity
of
man
whose
image
he
bears
illustration
great
battle
between
low
tribes
on
scum
compared
with
our
world
the
physical
features
of
scum
are
all
fashioned
on
a
much
larger
scale
and
the
mountains
rivers
and
vegetation
are
five
times
greater
than
ours
so
are
also
the
many
varieties
of
wild
and
domestic
animals
the
inhabitants
of
scum
are
divided
into
many
warring
tribes
and
it
is
fearful
to
see
the
conflicts
that
take
place
during
my
brief
stay
i
witnessed
one
of
the
big
battles
between
two
of
the
stronger
tribes
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
men
went
dashing
into
an
enemy
of
greater
numbers
it
was
a
foot
ball
melee
on
a
vast
scale
weapons
were
all
of
the
type
except
the
spear
wagons
which
were
indeed
clumsy
weapons
of
war
nothing
is
known
of
surrender
or
a
flag
of
truce
so
the
conflict
raged
horribly
to
a
bitter
end
until
eighty
thousand
bruised
victors
participated
in
the
jubilant
feast
that
followed
over
two
hundred
thousand
scumites
lay
dead
on
the
field
and
along
the
mountain
ridges
according
to
past
history
another
such
great
battle
is
not
liable
to
occur
for
another
generation
the
past
religion
of
these
giants
is
not
even
on
a
par
with
idolatry
there
are
many
saints
sleeping
in
their
graves
bright
remnants
of
the
time
of
the
old
civilization
and
religion
amidst
all
this
present
moral
wreck
of
humanity
there
are
a
few
indications
that
point
to
better
times
the
nobler
people
of
scum
are
banding
together
with
the
avowed
purpose
of
bringing
back
the
light
of
culture
and
refinement
but
it
will
require
several
thousand
years
of
determined
effort
to
climb
to
the
height
from
whence
their
ancestors
were
cruelly
and
thoughtlessly
dragged
chapter
xv
a
world
of
highest
invention
after
my
profitable
stay
in
this
immense
solar
system
in
the
milky
way
i
crossed
the
vast
dome
of
the
heavens
and
lighted
on
sirius
the
brightest
star
in
all
the
canopy
of
night
here
i
found
the
fire
life
of
alpha
centaurus
repeated
but
i
did
not
pause
to
study
the
odd
phases
presented
to
my
view
onward
i
moved
to
survey
the
remarkable
systems
of
worlds
that
revolve
around
sirius
it
is
a
veritable
medley
of
planets
large
and
small
inhabited
and
barren
sinless
sinful
and
millennial
a
little
universe
packed
in
a
nutshell
figuratively
speaking
the
orb
of
this
group
that
first
held
my
attention
is
very
notable
indeed
i
have
labeled
it
high
invention
and
it
is
still
entitled
to
that
distinction
it
revolves
around
sirius
at
a
distance
of
seven
million
miles
and
is
times
as
large
as
our
world
with
physical
features
and
climate
quite
dissimilar
here
in
this
world
of
ours
we
are
proud
of
the
wonderful
genius
displayed
by
our
inventors
and
is
not
this
conceit
pardonable
if
this
world
should
stand
and
inventive
genius
continue
at
its
present
compound
rate
of
progress
what
may
we
expect
to
see
a
hundred
or
a
thousand
years
hence
now
imagine
yourself
looking
down
upon
a
world
where
the
highest
inventive
skill
is
found
such
was
my
privilege
at
this
time
in
the
course
of
my
universal
journey
this
surprising
world
is
inhabited
by
a
persevering
race
of
human
beings
among
whom
are
a
large
number
of
illustrious
characters
who
walk
in
the
light
of
ten
thousand
years
of
human
achievements
it
need
not
be
said
that
i
was
intensely
interested
in
the
study
of
this
phenomenal
world
which
i
will
call
ploid
i
went
from
one
portion
of
the
planet
to
another
continually
remaining
invisible
after
i
had
witnessed
the
unequaled
sights
i
paused
to
complete
my
memoranda
and
now
as
i
review
my
jottings
i
am
at
a
loss
to
know
what
few
things
i
should
select
to
try
to
make
intelligible
to
my
who
live
on
this
infinitesimal
speck
which
is
our
world
first
let
me
call
attention
to
their
triumphs
in
the
vegetable
kingdom
the
people
of
ploid
have
in
their
possession
a
remarkable
line
of
fertilizers
not
in
the
form
of
ground
bones
but
acidulous
juices
these
juices
were
improved
for
three
thousand
years
until
there
was
a
particular
liquid
suited
to
each
separate
class
of
vegetables
as
used
at
the
present
time
a
certain
amount
of
the
is
poured
directly
about
the
seed
at
the
time
of
planting
this
acid
has
a
magical
effect
upon
the
soil
and
it
is
possible
by
repeated
fertilizing
to
raise
in
two
weeks
a
crop
of
zoftas
a
vegetable
similar
to
our
potatoes
for
raising
a
crop
in
two
weeks
the
fertilizer
costs
the
value
of
the
zoftas
and
for
maturing
a
crop
in
four
weeks
the
fertilizer
costs
about
of
the
value
of
the
zoftas
thus
it
is
possible
to
raise
six
of
these
crops
in
one
of
our
years
this
law
obtains
throughout
the
whole
vegetable
creation
however
in
ordinary
circumstances
the
stimulating
acid
is
used
in
very
light
quantities
the
people
have
learned
by
experience
that
vegetables
have
a
better
flavor
when
they
have
been
brought
to
maturity
by
the
slower
processes
these
wonderful
fertilizers
are
a
blessed
boon
in
the
time
of
crop
failures
for
then
the
same
crop
can
be
grown
anew
from
the
seed
and
hurried
to
maturity
before
the
close
of
the
season
the
curse
of
the
vegetable
worms
has
been
reduced
to
a
minimum
on
this
world
of
ploid
the
chemists
have
labored
patiently
for
one
thousand
years
to
produce
a
substance
that
will
not
destroy
vegetable
seed
and
at
the
same
time
kill
all
forms
of
parasites
the
results
have
been
gratifying
and
with
considerable
pleasure
i
viewed
a
garden
of
the
various
vegetables
that
are
grown
without
being
repulsed
at
the
sight
of
such
crawling
specimens
as
tomato
and
cabbage
worms
the
happiest
result
of
this
substance
is
seen
in
the
work
it
accomplishes
on
fruit
and
nut
trees
there
is
triple
the
variety
of
nuts
on
ploid
and
they
are
used
for
food
more
generally
than
in
our
world
there
is
no
such
an
animal
as
a
hog
and
no
lard
is
used
the
substitute
is
found
in
four
varieties
of
nut
oil
the
result
of
a
sweet
and
clean
vegetable
growth
nuts
are
raised
in
great
abundance
for
they
also
supply
the
base
for
a
spread
just
as
appetizing
and
more
economical
than
butter
their
modes
of
travel
the
ploidites
have
been
traveling
in
the
air
for
hundred
years
but
they
can
not
control
their
sufficiently
in
all
kinds
of
weather
the
atmosphere
of
ploid
is
relatively
lighter
than
ours
which
has
made
aerial
travel
more
difficult
to
perfect
than
it
would
be
in
our
world
the
main
traffic
both
passenger
and
freight
is
carried
on
by
the
tube
line
a
wonderful
system
perfected
through
thousands
of
years
of
painstaking
labor
two
immense
tubes
lying
side
by
side
each
ten
feet
in
diameter
made
of
a
substance
more
durable
than
steel
form
the
road
bed
of
this
lightning
system
of
travel
the
cars
have
hard
and
fit
over
raised
bars
all
around
on
the
inside
of
the
immense
tube
the
motor
power
is
called
and
is
communicated
throughout
the
whole
tube
line
by
brosis
a
porous
metal
running
in
thin
narrow
bands
this
tube
line
runs
without
a
curve
from
one
division
of
the
road
to
another
except
in
rare
cases
where
a
bend
is
absolutely
necessary
in
a
mountainous
region
i
noticed
a
stretch
of
tube
line
without
a
bend
running
sixty
miles
according
to
our
measurement
on
prairies
the
unbroken
stretches
are
much
longer
the
cars
in
this
tube
line
travel
with
fearful
rapidity
it
requires
two
or
three
miles
to
reach
dashing
speed
after
which
a
run
of
fifty
miles
is
made
in
eight
or
ten
minutes
no
precaution
need
be
taken
by
the
motorman
as
nothing
can
get
into
the
tube
and
only
one
train
is
allowed
in
a
section
at
one
time
certain
hours
are
given
to
passenger
traffic
and
others
to
freight
traffic
an
immense
amount
of
freight
can
thus
be
carried
in
one
hour
it
is
possible
to
send
a
through
freight
car
two
thousand
miles
in
ten
or
twelve
hours
express
cars
are
never
connected
with
passengers
cars
they
are
run
on
their
own
schedule
and
sometimes
attached
to
freight
cars
this
immense
tube
line
was
built
by
the
government
at
great
expense
but
it
is
proving
very
satisfactory
no
storms
or
floods
interfere
no
and
no
flying
dust
are
known
in
this
tube
line
which
has
brought
the
ends
of
ploid
together
think
of
a
person
crossing
a
vast
continent
in
a
day
for
the
cars
in
this
tube
line
run
with
frightful
speed
across
the
long
stretches
of
level
they
make
as
high
as
a
mile
run
in
forty
minutes
without
stopping
the
signal
and
telegraph
stations
are
fifty
miles
apart
sometimes
more
in
these
long
runs
the
motorman
stops
only
when
a
signal
is
turned
against
him
or
if
by
accident
he
discerns
a
train
in
the
tube
ahead
of
him
the
tube
line
is
lighted
by
oval
transparencies
in
size
and
shape
resembling
an
egg
soldered
in
specially
prepared
holes
of
the
tube
the
cars
are
not
supplied
with
air
from
the
tube
fresh
air
is
obtained
from
the
evaporation
of
a
on
the
top
of
this
tube
line
there
is
a
double
railroad
used
for
local
travel
both
passenger
and
freight
their
storage
batteries
compared
with
our
world
the
fuel
of
ploid
is
very
scarce
but
less
is
required
to
supply
the
industries
nearly
all
power
is
obtained
from
the
winds
running
water
and
the
sun
energy
the
winds
are
harnessed
so
that
they
blow
not
in
vain
almost
every
home
of
ordinary
intelligence
owns
one
of
the
many
kinds
of
storage
batteries
used
in
this
world
these
batteries
are
usually
located
beneath
the
lowest
floor
of
the
house
and
they
constitute
the
reservoir
whence
is
obtained
the
necessary
power
for
lighting
heating
and
cooling
the
apartments
of
the
home
people
who
live
along
streams
of
water
utilize
these
streams
for
similar
purposes
it
is
now
conceded
in
ploid
that
the
storage
batteries
of
the
home
can
be
supplied
as
economically
and
effectively
by
winds
and
the
sun
heat
as
by
running
streams
hence
it
is
a
common
sight
to
see
residences
throwing
out
the
old
water
machinery
and
introducing
the
latest
design
of
or
there
are
certain
emergencies
when
the
storage
batteries
fail
to
work
or
when
the
power
is
exhausted
this
happens
when
there
is
a
very
slight
wind
for
several
days
or
a
heavy
drain
of
power
in
such
cases
fuel
is
used
for
heating
and
lighting
palaces
of
ploid
the
palaces
of
ploid
are
dreams
of
beauty
and
convenience
outshining
and
surpassing
by
far
the
finest
mansions
on
the
face
of
our
globe
in
these
abodes
the
sum
total
of
glory
and
convenience
converges
flowing
from
almost
numberless
discoveries
during
the
last
one
hundred
years
in
round
numbers
there
have
been
five
hundred
thousand
patents
issued
in
the
united
states
in
the
nineteenth
century
but
the
ploidites
excel
us
by
double
that
number
for
a
similar
territorial
limit
the
reward
of
inventors
patents
are
not
issued
in
ploid
the
government
gives
liberal
rewards
to
each
inventor
or
discoverer
the
applicant
appears
personally
before
the
district
committee
on
inventions
if
this
committee
considers
the
invention
worthy
of
a
reward
the
applicant
is
recommended
to
one
of
the
central
committees
at
the
seat
of
the
government
this
central
committee
carefully
considers
the
invention
or
discovery
places
on
it
an
estimate
as
to
its
local
or
governmental
value
and
fills
out
papers
in
accordance
with
its
findings
this
paper
must
be
signed
by
the
chief
inventor
and
the
applicant
at
once
receives
his
first
installment
which
is
continued
in
some
instances
during
natural
life
in
the
case
of
some
extraordinary
invention
the
immediate
relatives
of
the
inventor
are
pensioned
for
five
or
ten
years
in
his
honor
naturally
under
this
system
the
government
owns
all
inventions
and
reaps
a
heavy
return
from
them
enough
to
pay
all
the
installments
to
the
inventors
and
the
officers
employed
to
carry
on
this
branch
of
the
government
work
some
particular
inventions
one
of
the
most
convenient
inventions
i
saw
on
this
planet
of
ploid
was
the
carrying
of
a
photograph
or
image
along
a
wire
the
people
of
ploid
can
not
only
talk
to
one
another
many
miles
apart
but
they
can
also
see
each
other
while
they
are
talking
this
wonderful
attachment
to
their
telephones
by
which
the
human
face
is
also
carried
over
the
wire
was
perfected
over
one
thousand
years
ago
i
herewith
give
a
few
uses
to
which
this
invention
is
applied
office
men
have
photograph
wires
connected
with
their
homes
and
they
can
thus
talk
to
and
see
any
one
of
the
family
at
their
pleasure
it
can
be
so
arranged
that
the
wife
in
the
home
can
by
touching
a
little
knob
see
into
her
husband
office
with
which
the
wire
is
connected
or
the
husband
in
the
office
can
see
into
the
room
of
the
house
with
which
the
connection
is
made
at
either
end
of
the
wire
the
vision
can
be
obstructed
by
drawing
a
curtain
over
the
sensitive
plate
the
foreman
of
an
industrial
work
shop
can
see
from
his
home
the
men
under
his
charge
the
superintendent
of
any
large
works
can
at
his
will
peer
into
any
apartment
he
wishes
from
his
head
office
the
advantages
of
this
arrangement
can
be
easily
seen
a
minister
can
see
from
his
study
the
nature
of
his
audience
before
he
leaves
home
farmers
can
watch
their
cattle
and
their
fruits
without
leaving
the
house
or
barn
according
to
where
the
connections
are
made
persons
can
be
in
bed
at
night
and
if
they
imagine
they
hear
a
robber
in
any
room
they
can
first
turn
on
the
photograph
current
and
then
the
light
flash
in
this
way
one
can
look
without
leaving
his
bed
into
each
room
of
the
house
having
given
a
few
illustrations
of
this
marvelous
invention
the
reader
can
readily
see
the
variety
of
uses
which
it
will
serve
their
latest
discovery
in
light
is
a
decided
improvement
over
our
electric
light
i
know
of
no
sensible
name
to
give
it
but
the
name
that
comes
nearest
to
describing
it
according
to
our
terms
would
be
phosphorous
light
it
gives
a
mild
but
yet
positive
radiance
and
closely
resembles
diffused
sunlight
the
ages
of
ploid
one
of
the
strangest
theories
of
the

on

of

they
divide
time
into
three
general
periods
of
ages

temperate

age

the
people
teach
that
there
was
a
race
of
human
beings
who
inhabited
their
world
when
it
was
yet
in
a
molten
state
and
that
as
their
earth
cooled
off
the
race
became
extinct
this
age
they
claim
was
followed
by
the
temperate
age
or
the
age
in
which
they
are
now
living
it
is
also
claimed
that
when
their
earth
cools
and
the
frigid
blasts
freeze
out
the
world
there
will
gradually
commence
the
age
of

have
distanced
us
in
the

of
the

system
including
the
intricate
problems
of
the
cerebrum
and
cerebellum

have
ascertained
by
long
ages
of
observation
and
experimenting
the
exact
effect
of
every
kind
of
impulse
on
the

the
experts
are
able
to
tell
at

examination
what
kinds
of
thinking
were
most
prevalent
during
the

just
as
easily
as
we
can
judge
the
great
or
little
use
of
the
arm
by
an
examination
of

more

is
their

the

we

a
singular
planet
i
visited
the
other
seventy
worlds
that
revolve
around
sirius
among
them
is
one
of
note
called
zik
which
is
hundred
millions
of
miles
from
its
sun
and
is
slightly
smaller
than
our
world
it
is
inhabited
by
a
race
of
pigmies
which
i
will
call
zikites
wonderful
indeed
is
the
intelligence
of
these
creatures
although
their
form
is
out
of
symmetry
according
to
our
standards
i
will
therefore
avoid
a
description
of
their
physical
features
lest
it
might
mar
the
picture
of
their
accomplishments
the
air
of
zik
is
heavy
and
the
sky
is
opal
in
its
effects
the
chemists
have
thus
far
found
in
nature
ninety
elementary
substances
and
it
is
partly
due
to
this
large
variety
that
the
zikites
have
surpassed
their
fellow
men
in
thousands
of
worlds
as
you
study
the
past
events
of
this
unusual
planet
you
are
reminded
of
our
own
history
on
zik
there
are
heathen
tribes
and
all
grades
of
conflicting
civilized
nations
war
has
reddened
this
distant
world
for
several
thousand
years
and
as
yet
there
is
no
peace
notwithstanding
all
this
unceasing
upheaval
the
tide
of
human
progress
has
steadily
risen
it
does
appear
that
the
highest
light
of
intellect
is
generated
like
electric
light
through
sharp
friction
the
zikites
have
had
their
men
of
war
vessels
of
mighty
strength
and
in
their
action
but
all
such
defense
has
been
abandoned
over
five
hundred
years
ago
and
it
came
about
in
a
natural
manner
one
of
the
many
illustrious
inventors
perfected
the
submarine
boat
and
the
at
about
the
same
time
their
might
appropriately
be
called
in
our
language
the
flying
devil
for
such
it
is
if
you
consider
its
destroying
power
one
of
these
ominous
looking
machines
is
capable
of
destroying
a
whole
navy
as
fast
as
it
can
move
high
in
the
air
from
one
vessel
to
another
it
can
also
tear
to
pieces
an
enemy
camp
that
lies
in
the
open
field
all
this
is
accomplished
by
dropping
shells
composed
partly
of
some
elements
not
found
in
our
world
these
shells
are
made
in
such
a
way
that
they
explode
as
soon
as
they
touch
any
substance
and
the
concussion
is
much
more
terrible
than
is
caused
by
our
most
powerful
explosives
because
no
ship
could
hold
together
under
such
destructive
shells
the
nations
abandoned
their
navies
and
devoted
their
energy
to
devising
a
safe
camp
for
soldiers
and
to
building
these
with
additional
improvements
it
was
found
that
the
only
way
to
protect
a
camp
was
to
cover
it
with
a
water
proof
shed
so
constructed
that
nine
or
ten
inches
of
water
would
remain
on
the
roof
then
a
wide
shallow
trench
was
dug
around
the
shed
and
kept
filled
with
water
these
shells
will
not
explode
if
they
fall
in
that
depth
of
water
but
will
explode
in
water
of
greater
depth
you
can
see
at
a
glance
how
difficult
it
is
to
manage
an
army
under
these
circumstances
the
only
redeeming
feature
is
that
the
enemy
also
is
compelled
to
resort
to
the
same
protection
an
international
law
forbids
the
destruction
of
homes
in
times
of
war
illustration
the
battle
of
the
flying
devils
wars
are
of
short
duration
usually
the
decisive
conflict
is
fought
in
the
air
and
is
the
most
terrible
of
them
all
imagine
two
of
these
flying
devils
approaching
one
another
far
above
the
surface
of
zik
each
vessel
is
set
in
action
long
before
it
is
in
range
of
the
other
in
the
hope
of
firing
the
first
effective
shot
each
party
of
the
conflict
knows
that
the
air
vessel
first
struck
will
be
at
an
end
forever
for
it
will
be
blown
to
pieces
and
every
life
on
board
will
be
shattered
into
shapeless
masses
while
the
wreckage
falls
amidst
the
burning
of
the
combustibles
what
a
horrible
ending
of
a
short
battle
the
wisest
of
the
zikites
have
proposed
many
plans
to
settle
international
differences
but
like
us
they
have
failed
to
suggest
any
plan
that
has
proved
to
be
practicable
the
largest
nation
of
zik
has
advanced
far
ahead
of
us
on
the
labor
question
but
this
was
not
reached
until
the
contest
between
capital
and
labor
had
left
its
through
many
centuries
a
brief
description
of
the
manner
in
which
the
industrial
problem
was
solved
will
not
be
out
of
place
i
will
waste
no
words
n
showing
the
many
points
of
difference
between
our
customs
and
those
of
zik
after
hundreds
of
years
of
painful
struggling
the
many
laborers
of
this
largest
nation
completed
a
solid
organization
and
thereby
gained
control
of
the
whole
government
then
in
their
zeal
to
legislate
in
favor
of
the
laboring
classes
the
ruling
element
stepped
to
the
other
extreme
by
passing
many
unreasonable
laws
things
passed
along
in
this
unsettled
condition
until
a
certain
few
of
the
labor
leaders
having
become
wealthy
themselves
yielded
to
a
heavy
bribe
and
amended
the
laws
so
as
to
favor
the
wealthy
minority
the
magnates
of
capital
shrewdly
took
advantage
of
this
traitorship
and
in
the
following
campaign
won
the
national
election
the
wealthy
now
having
the
reins
of
power
in
their
own
hands
took
the
initiative
and
called
for
a
consultation
between
the
heads
of
the
government
and
the
chief
leaders
of
labor
this
proved
to
be
a
wise
political
move
and
as
a
result
a
new
system
of
laws
relating
to
all
trades
and
occupations
was
enacted
the
following
conditions
still
prevail
a
day
work
consists
of
less
hours
a
minimum
scale
of
wages
is
adopted
for
each
trade
this
scale
is
based
upon
the
price
of
certain
staple
articles
and
within
a
certain
limit
it
rises
or
falls
with
the
price
of
these
necessities
all
regular
citizens
must
be
supplied
with
work
if
they
desire
it
if
they
can
not
get
employment
from
some
firm
or
corporation
the
government
officials
represented
locally
must
supply
it
or
its
equivalent
in
money
the
government
controls
enough
of
the
business
to
employ
of
the
male
population
this
enables
the
government
to
take
so
great
a
responsibility
and
bear
it
with
satisfactory
results
any
man
through
negligence
failing
to
support
his
family
is
put
to
the
government
penitentiary
service
and
his
family
is
thereafter
supported
from
the
public
treasury
a
widow
or
orphan
is
cared
for
by
regular
authorities
the
of
this
fifth
article
regulate
the
work
of
women
no
credit
is
allowed
except
on
a
government
signed
by
the
local
representative
of
the
state
if
the
bill
is
not
paid
by
the
one
making
the
debt
the
amount
of
which
is
always
stipulated
the
government
will
pay
it
and
proceed
to
collect
it
in
one
of
three
ways
the
last
resort
is
according
to
article
four
there
are
several
other
sections
governing
private
ownership
of
property
land
and
business
these
new
laws
have
had
a
very
good
effect
the
number
of
persons
getting
immensely
wealthy
gradually
decreased
and
the
average
wealth
of
the
laborers
increased
the
government
has
the
power
at
any
time
to
form
a
trust
or
combination
of
any
line
of
business
by
paying
liberally
to
those
already
engaged
in
it
this
assists
the
government
in
carrying
its
heavy
financial
burdens
and
every
family
is
assured
of
support
if
the
soil
produces
enough
to
feed
the
people
and
now
if
i
knew
how
to
describe
elements
that
have
no
resemblance
to
anything
in
our
world
i
would
proceed
to
tell
a
story
of
interest
to
chemists
these
zikites
have
formed
gases
and
solids
unknown
to
us
and
naturally
they
are
capable
of
performing
experiments
more
wonderful
than
anything
ever
known
in
our
world
when
i
saw
their
performances
i
thought
that
the
marvelous
feats
of
the
orient
were
being
performed
on
a
scale
more
mysterious
and
magnificent
to
see
a
man
play
with
red
hot
irons
and
dance
in
a
seething
furnace
makes
one
believe
that
his
eyes
are
deceiving
him
i
saw
a
man
draw
the
birds
from
heaven
and
dormant
reptiles
from
the
soil
but
ask
me
not
to
tell
how
a
few
of
these
zikites
have
discovered
some
wonderful
secrets
of
nature
and
will
not
disclose
them
except
to
certain
ones
of
their
own
lineage
one
of
these
secrets
is
the
art
of
embalming
the
dead
so
perfectly
that
human
features
are
retained
forever
unless
destroyed
by
fire
or
human
effort
the
embalming
fluid
contains
some
of
the
elements
not
found
in
our
world
but
this
is
not
the
total
secret
the
body
must
lie
in
an
receptacle
into
which
a
secret
gas
is
pumped
the
dead
body
lying
in
this
receptacle
for
two
hours
absorbs
certain
parts
of
the
gas
which
enters
the
pores
and
touches
those
parts
of
the
dead
body
not
reached
by
the
injected
fluid
by
this
process
no
part
of
the
body
is
subject
to
putrefaction
and
the
muscles
all
retain
their
rigidity
so
that
one
hundred
years
after
burial
the
features
are
full
although
discolored
not
many
of
the
common
people
are
thus
embalmed
but
the
bodies
of
prominent
men
and
women
are
thus
treated
at
government
expense
and
unborn
generations
can
look
upon
the
full
contour
of
their
faces
another
secret
held
by
these
experts
is
the
art
of
maintaining
youthful
vigor
in
old
age
this
is
a
very
expensive
method
and
the
government
prohibits
any
one
securing
this
treatment
who
has
not
won
special
honor
in
one
or
another
particular
channel
one
of
the
highest
distinctions
bestowed
upon
any
citizen
of
zik
is
to
grant
him
the
angel
honor
which
entitles
him
to
receive
the
vigor
treatment
during
the
balance
of
his
natural
life
this
one
thing
more
than
any
other
is
the
secret
of
zik
having
so
long
a
list
of
illustrious
characters
it
is
the
ambition
of
each
boy
or
girl
to
make
progress
and
some
day
win
the
honor
the
religious
life
of
these
zikites
is
unusually
intense
their
language
is
much
more
cumbersome
than
ours
they
have
a
small
book
which
contains
a
list
of
great
truths
whose
authors
claim
to
have
been
influenced
by
the
or
the
same
as
our
god
this
book
has
had
a
remarkable
history
and
has
moulded
the
life
and
character
of
millions
every
person
is
left
to
his
own
notions
in
religion
and
we
see
here
the
same
picture
that
confronts
us
on
our
own
planet
the
very
good
and
the
very
bad
in
the
same
house
and
neighborhood
they
build
but
few
churches
but
here
and
there
a
home
of
a
believer
is
the
center
of
a
worshiping
company
on
special
occasions
the
worshipers
rent
or
secure
large
public
buildings
and
have
an
enthusiastic
time
at
many
places
their
bible
speaks
of
a
place
where
the
departed
go
after
death
beyond
the
zik
life
these
worshipers
are
linked
to
their
god
by
the
same
kind
of
that
bind
christians
to
their
master
in
our
world
you
can
not
imagine
my
interest
and
my
joy
as
i
learned
that
the
zikites
are
looking
forward
to
a
period
of
time
corresponding
to
our
millennium
their
religious
literature
is
full
of
references
to
this
coming
golden
age
and
many
poetical
compositions
point
to
it
with
rapturous
melody
of
language
chapter
xvii
the
diamond
world
when
one
reads
of
the
size
and
population
of
our
world
he
is
thrilled
with
the
idea
of
its
greatness
but
when
he
travels
over
land
and
sea
visiting
the
many
points
of
interest
he
is
impressed
with
the
magnitude
of
the
earth
and
the
vast
numbers
that
populate
it
it
is
infinitely
more
so
in
regard
to
the
many
suns
and
planets
that
compose
the
universe
i
had
read
of
the
distances
of
space
and
of
the
number
of
celestial
bodies
that
are
scattered
throughout
these
measureless
expanses
and
i
was
profoundly
impressed
with
the
vastness
of
created
things
and
the
eternal
revolutions
of
the
countless
spheres
but
when
i
took
my
continued
flight
away
from
the
solar
system
of
sirius
and
was
privileged
to
get
a
passing
glimpse
of
many
other
solar
systems
i
was
overawed
a
at
the
myriad
motions
of
the
myriad
worlds
each
serving
its
little
part
through
the
passing
cycles
to
carry
out
the
plan
of
the
infinite
mind
my
next
pause
was
at
the
glorious
constellation
of
orion
on
the
star
rigel
this
brilliant
orb
is
not
inhabited
but
more
than
of
the
worlds
revolving
around
it
sustain
human
life
after
i
had
taken
a
passing
glimpse
of
a
few
worlds
belonging
to
this
system
i
proceeded
to
visit
another
world
that
revolves
around
rigel
at
a
distance
of
sixteen
hundred
million
miles
it
is
a
trifle
larger
than
our
world
and
is
inhabited
by
only
about
as
many
people
this
is
the
brightest
planet
i
had
ever
seen
for
it
dazzled
and
sparkled
like
pearls
of
ice
in
the
sun
and
yet
it
gave
forth
no
light
of
its
own
i
soon
learned
the
secret
of
all
this
scintillation
i
had
come
to
a
world
that
seemed
to
be
covered
with
diamonds
and
precious
stones
the
mountains
were
barren
of
all
vegetation
and
glistened
with
all
the
glory
of
a
hundred
rainbows
i
presumed
that
i
had
come
to
immense
beds
of
quartz
but
the
rare
brilliancy
of
the
whole
scene
set
me
to
work
to
ascertain
the
value
of
these
stones
to
my
astonishment
i
found
that
the
shining
mountains
and
valleys
were
filled
with
genuine
diamonds
and
precious
stones
some
of
which
are
very
rare
according
to
our
classification
i
was
dazed
at
the
sight
first
because
of
its
brilliancy
and
beauty
and
next
because
of
the
fabulous
fortunes
that
were
lying
at
my
feet
then
i
transported
myself
to
another
part
of
the
planet
that
i
might
get
a
view
of
its
living
fields
of
vegetation
alas
i
again
met
the
shining
of
countless
gems
set
by
nature
in
ledges
of
rock
and
massed
in
confused
heaps
all
around
me
what
a
rich
world
i
inwardly
murmured
how
can
people
live
on
diamonds
as
i
was
thus
musing
i
sped
onward
to
one
of
the
soil
centers
of
this
world
here
i
found
a
small
city
built
of
diamonds
and
choice
stones
of
which
the
people
thought
no
more
than
we
do
of
the
stones
brought
down
from
our
quarries
the
soil
was
almost
worshiped
only
the
wealthiest
could
afford
to
have
it
in
their
homes
for
the
growth
of
flowers
fortunately
the
soil
is
very
productive
and
by
reason
of
its
scarcity
it
has
received
such
careful
attention
that
all
worthless
weeds
have
been
actually
choked
out
several
thousand
years
ago
thus
the
soil
being
so
desirable
and
staple
an
article
it
was
eagerly
sought
after
by
all
who
lived
on
this
shining
world
yea
some
sacrificed
their
all
that
they
might
obtain
a
goodly
portion
of
the
soil
this
desire
was
so
great
that
it
became
the
ruling
passion
of
many
people
to
accumulate
soil
all
the
days
of
their
life
and
many
died
of
grief
because
they
could
not
succeed
in
satisfying
their
ambitions
now
when
the
speculators
saw
that
the
soil
was
so
indispensable
and
much
desired
by
the
people
and
that
out
of
it
were
the
issues
of
life
the
wealthier
and
more
crafty
of
them
said
among
themselves
come
let
us
buy
all
the
soil
we
and
our
brethren
in
all
the
soil
centers
and
let
us
call
ourselves
a
trust
signifying
that
we
will
trust
one
another
to
the
secrets
of
our
enterprise
and
behold
this
saying
seemed
good
in
the
eyes
of
these
wise
men
and
they
labored
diligently
until
in
the
passing
of
a
few
years
they
had
secured
unto
themselves
full
possession
of
all
the
soil
of
the
diamond
world
and
it
was
so
in
the
course
of
time
that
these
corporations
held
a
great
meeting
and
they
said
barns
we
will
build
to
store
products
of
the
soil
and
behold
we
will
sell
from
these
storehouses
to
our
workmen
for
the
labor
that
they
may
render
unto
us
this
scheme
was
pleasing
to
all
the
capitalists
and
they
rejoiced
in
the
bright
prospect
of
the
future
so
they
built
great
barns
and
thus
laid
away
the
products
of
the
soil
then
they
appointed
agents
to
sell
whatsoever
the
people
wished
and
it
came
to
pass
as
the
seasons
came
and
went
that
these
capitalists
gave
the
laborers
less
for
their
toil
and
charged
them
more
for
food
at
the
supply
stations
thus
the
conditions
became
so
severe
that
a
man
could
work
from
the
rising
of
the
sun
to
the
setting
thereof
and
they
earn
scarcely
enough
to
keep
his
family
alive
after
this
manner
the
land
owners
grew
more
and
more
wealthy
built
unto
themselves
handsome
little
villages
and
lived
in
happiness
and
refinement
they
also
erected
for
themselves
select
schools
and
reserved
beautiful
plots
for
their
luxury
and
amusement
then
did
the
members
of
this
trust
in
order
to
protect
themselves
from
all
possible
trouble
pass
a
civil
law
forbidding
any
laborer
to
own
an
inch
of
soil
thus
it
was
very
easy
to
convict
a
man
of
theft
if
soil
could
be
found
upon
his
person
or
premises
now
behold
there
were
many
little
spots
of
vegetation
scattered
here
and
there
over
this
whole
world
but
the
agents
of
the
trust
sent
out
numerous
expeditions
to
gather
up
all
the
loose
earth
that
could
be
found
and
carry
it
to
the
soil
centers
this
work
was
so
completely
done
that
every
nook
and
corner
yielded
its
accumulated
dust
to
enlarge
the
gardens
at
the
soil
centers
and
thereby
increase
the
riches
of
the
trust
now
as
time
passed
on
the
children
of
the
laborers
were
also
employed
to
assist
in
earning
bread
and
in
the
course
of
a
few
hundred
years
the
school
houses
in
the
district
of
the
laborers
were
torn
down
as
it
was
impossible
for
these
children
to
receive
an
education
since
they
must
needs
work
for
their
sustenance
after
many
ages
the
members
of
the
trust
had
become
so
hardened
that
they
no
longer
regarded
the
wishes
of
the
laboring
people
but
pushed
everything
to
increase
their
own
selfish
gain
insomuch
that
they
succeeded
in
securing
the
passage
of
certain
laws
making
the
burdens
of
the
laborers
still
more
heavy
and
now
when
the
capitalists
saw
that
the
people
did
not
rebel
they
again
counseled
among
themselves
on
this
wise
why
should
there
be
so
much
labor
lost
in
continually
quarrying
new
sepulchers
in
our
diamond
ridges
and
why
should
there
be
so
much
dust
lying
idle
in
the
old
graves
come
let
us
have
a
law
that
the
dust
in
all
graves
over
one
hundred
years
old
shall
be
sold
at
auction
unless
the
graves
are
redeemed
by
a
certain
amount
of
soil
then
these
empty
tombs
can
be
again
filled
with
the
dead
of
our
servants
and
their
children
thus
let
it
be
continued
throughout
coming
generations
forever
each
year
this
auction
shall
be
held
to
dispose
of
the
dust
remaining
in
sepulchers
these
suggestions
found
favor
in
the
eyes
of
the
trust
who
proceeded
at
once
to
take
the
necessary
steps
to
incorporate
these
regulations
into
the
laws
of
the
commonwealth
the
laborers
stoutly
opposed
the
adoption
of
these
partial
measures
but
they
were
powerless
because
the
trust
bribed
enough
of
the
legislators
to
carry
their
point
all
this
happened
many
centuries
ago
so
that
when
i
was
there
i
saw
the
full
program
of
one
of
these
spectral
auctions
and
was
chilled
with
horror
at
the
proceedings
every
year
this
peculiar
auction
is
held
at
each
soil
center
the
wealthy
are
able
to
redeem
their
sepulchers
but
the
poor
having
no
soil
can
not
satisfy
the
law
so
the
dust
of
their
ancestors
must
be
sold
laborers
are
sent
out
to
open
the
sepulchers
along
the
diamond
ridges
and
carry
the
coffins
to
one
place
here
they
are
publicly
opened
and
the
bones
and
dust
gathered
into
one
receptacle
after
which
the
weird
auction
begins
no
one
can
compete
with
the
corporations
and
no
one
tries
illustration
the
most
horrible
auction
in
our
universe
the
legal
form
of
the
auction
is
soon
over
and
the
half
ton
or
ton
of
dust
is
legally
bought
by
the
corporations
whose
officers
order
it
to
be
sprinkled
over
the
gardens
it
serves
the
same
purpose
as
phosphate
in
our
fields
this
awful
process
is
repeated
each
year
the
sepulchers
emptied
thus
are
open
for
new
burials
so
you
can
see
that
with
all
the
gruesomeness
of
this
whole
business
there
is
an
economic
side
to
it
and
the
people
have
come
to
view
it
all
in
a
philosophical
manner
when
this
wretched
custom
was
first
inaugurated
a
bitter
wail
ascended
from
the
ranks
of
the
laboring
classes
for
they
well
knew
whose
graves
would
be
opened
never
was
there
such
a
stir
among
the
working
classes
of
people
they
held
mass
meetings
and
grew
loudly
indignant
until
the
trust
became
alarmed
at
the
uprising
then
did
some
of
these
rich
sharpsters
who
were
best
gifted
in
speech
go
out
to
meet
their
servants
addressing
them
thus
let
your
hearts
be
at
peace
my
fellow
creatures
this
new
law
that
we
have
just
passed
is
a
boon
to
every
toiler
for
we
seek
to
lighten
your
burdens
by
utilizing
the
idle
dust
from
the
tombs
hereafter
we
propose
to
give
free
of
charge
a
sepulcher
to
every
toiler
in
which
he
may
take
his
rest
for
one
hundred
years
these
graves
shall
be
for
you
and
your
children
forever
is
it
not
a
precious
thought
that
one
hundred
years
after
you
are
dead
your
bodies
shall
again
mingle
with
the
soil
and
without
voluntary
effort
or
pain
help
to
support
your
kindred
yet
unborn
if
our
present
silly
customs
should
prevail
the
time
will
come
when
half
our
soil
will
have
been
carried
to
the
sepulchers
and
therefore
your
tasks
would
be
more
severe
after
this
manner
spake
the
fellows
and
behold
their
speeches
were
as
oil
on
the
troubled
waters
under
their
sophistries
the
laborers
were
content
and
peacefully
went
to
their
tasks
again
after
three
months
of
unrest
then
did
the
members
of
the
corporations
consult
again
and
spake
among
themselves
in
this
fashion
for
our
protection
let
us
gather
from
the
laborers
the
youthful
and
the
strong
have
them
taught
in
tactics
of
war
and
make
it
unlawful
for
any
to
carry
deadly
weapons
except
these
trained
men
whom
we
will
call
our
soil
defenders
and
if
any
of
the
laborers
should
ask
are
we
called
to
do
this
work
we
will
say
to
them
the
defense
of
the
soil
and
the
defense
of
our
families
are
ye
called
therefore
quit
yourselves
nobly
and
it
shall
come
to
pass
that
when
the
laborers
commence
a
foolish
struggle
for
their
own
selfish
gain
we
can
use
these
trained
soldiers
to
keep
them
in
peace
and
thus
we
need
not
spend
so
much
of
our
breath
by
way
of
persuasion
behold
this
thing
seemed
reasonable
and
seasonable
in
the
eyes
of
the
trust
they
did
according
to
these
suggestions
and
gathered
unto
themselves
in
the
name
of
the
civil
law
the
strongest
of
the
youth
and
trained
them
in
all
the
ways
of
war
thus
did
these
workmen
lose
all
their
liberties
by
slow
degrees
until
they
were
no
more
troublesome
but
labored
like
slaves
to
get
the
wherewithal
to
live
as
i
witnessed
this
sad
picture
resulting
from
the
inhumanity
of
man
to
man
i
was
at
once
reminded
of
what
i
had
seen
on
mars
and
of
the
struggle
now
pending
in
my
own
world
once
more
i
breathed
a
silent
prayer
to
the
ruler
of
all
worlds
in
behalf
of
the
crushed
hands
and
bleeding
hearts
that
are
bruised
in
order
that
certain
men
may
make
their
thousands
in
a
day
i
studied
the
social
life
of
the
refined
villagers
and
learned
with
much
interest
that
the
word
they
use
for
soil
is
used
in
the
same
esteemed
connection
in
which
we
use
the
word
gold
or
diamond
preachers
teachers
and
orators
make
endless
references
to
the
soil
finally
i
approached
in
a
visible
form
a
few
professors
who
were
engaged
in
a
special
discussion
they
were
alarmed
at
my
sudden
appearance
not
knowing
whence
i
came
nor
what
sort
of
an
animal
i
might
be
i
quickly
calmed
their
troubled
minds
by
using
language
they
easily
understood
and
explained
that
i
was
neither
a
ghost
nor
a
spirit
but
a
mere
citizen
of
another
world
having
for
a
limited
period
a
free
excursion
ticket
to
a
thousand
worlds
and
that
i
chose
their
planet
as
one
whereon
to
spend
a
fleeting
period
not
having
been
accustomed
to
such
visitants
they
were
at
first
skeptical
and
thoroughly
overawed
at
my
presence
i
purposely
became
as
familiar
as
possible
and
cautioned
them
to
remain
in
the
selfsame
room
and
spread
no
notice
of
my
presence
to
this
request
they
reluctantly
consented
after
my
nonplused
auditors
gained
their
senses
somewhat
they
ventured
to
reply
to
my
coaxing
questions
these
finally
led
to
the
following
interrogations
on
their
part
how
large
is
your
world
came
a
question
from
one
not
quite
so
large
as
this
one
i
replied
have
you
much
soil
there
a
million
times
more
than
you
have
here
what
a
wonderfully
rich
world
the
people
must
be
gloriously
happy
with
such
fabulous
wealth
around
them
the
bulk
of
my
there
are
not
happy
i
sighed
so
many
spend
their
lives
looking
for
diamonds
and
gold
the
most
of
whom
are
doomed
to
disappointment
an
incredulous
smile
crept
over
the
faces
of
my
friends
and
by
it
i
read
the
doubt
that
was
arising
in
their
hearts
as
to
the
truth
of
my
utterance
my
words
are
sincere
i
insisted
if
you
could
take
one
bushel
of
your
diamonds
to
the
world
where
i
live
you
could
get
more
soil
for
them
than
you
have
on
your
whole
globe
that
world
is
heaven
exclaimed
a
few
of
my
hearers
at
once
a
world
of
such
abundant
soil
can
not
be
any
other
place
then
i
learned
that
their
conception
of
heaven
is
not
a
place
of
streets
but
a
place
where
soil
is
freely
distributed
even
on
the
sides
of
the
streets
i
continued
speaking
telling
them
how
diamonds
were
considered
in
our
world
these
professors
were
astonished
beyond
measure
at
my
description
and
each
one
seemed
to
crave
for
the
knowledge
to
transport
a
large
consignment
of
their
diamonds
to
our
earth
and
return
with
acres
of
soil
to
the
diamond
world
i
spent
a
felicitous
period
with
these
scholars
of
the
diamond
world
they
prayed
and
begged
that
i
should
remain
and
appear
before
the
corporations
their
spirits
drooped
when
i
told
them
that
if
i
had
any
more
time
to
spend
visibly
on
their
world
i
would
prefer
to
comfort
the
laborers
and
their
suffering
families
who
had
been
so
long
deprived
of
the
fair
treatment
they
deserved
my
hearers
became
ashen
with
fear
now
feeling
doubly
assured
that
i
was
a
forerunner
of
some
terrible
curse
that
was
about
to
fall
upon
the
trusts
and
corporations
whom
those
professors
were
serving
so
assiduously
without
ever
speaking
a
word
of
protest
in
favor
of
the
human
slaves
around
them
once
more
i
related
my
station
but
i
spoke
in
most
convincing
terms
of
the
eternal
curse
with
which
the
infinite
would
visit
the
guilty
of
all
worlds
as
i
left
them
i
saw
that
my
last
words
brought
no
relief
to
their
faces
and
after
a
long
silence
they
nervously
discussed
the
whole
affair
not
being
able
to
account
for
the
exceptional
experience
through
which
they
had
just
passed
i
visited
in
a
form
invisible
the
mansions
of
the
rich
and
found
that
the
most
choice
ornaments
on
their
parlor
shelves
consisted
of
vials
of
soil
or
dirt
and
in
the
homes
of
the
most
wealthy
only
i
saw
flowering
plants
it
chanced
that
i
visited
this
world
at
the
graduating
period
of
the
greater
schools
this
gave
me
privilege
to
hear
an
oration
on
the
soil
and
the
diamond
a
synopsis
of
which
i
will
translate
as
correctly
as
i
can
it
will
be
remembered
that
i
must
use
terms
and
style
suitable
to
our
language
o
beautiful
soil
thou
art
but
a
type
of
thy
maker
invisible
thou
dost
give
birth
to
countless
forms
and
nursest
them
all
from
thy
own
bosom
from
the
atom
thou
bringest
the
oak
and
all
its
children
fall
back
into
thy
arms
for
succor
from
thy
own
heart
spring
the
infinite
types
of
vegetable
beauty
all
painted
and
frescoed
by
thy
own
exquisite
touches
o
mysterious
soil
wrapped
in
thy
bosom
lie
a
thousand
secrets
which
if
i
could
but
read
i
might
interpret
and
thus
learn
anew
of
my
creator
thou
holdest
the
ashes
of
the
millions
slain
and
the
dust
of
all
our
forefathers
o
silent
soil
how
thou
workest
without
the
flying
shuttle
or
the
hum
of
the
busy
bees
thou
doest
thy
greatest
deeds
without
the
sounding
of
a
trumpet
silently
thy
atoms
take
their
places
to
serve
in
higher
forms
o
teach
me
thy
mute
language
that
i
may
live
and
sacrifice
for
others
without
my
crying
and
my
sighing
o
humble
soil
thy
elements
when
formed
into
man
or
fruit
or
any
kind
of
food
return
again
without
complaint
when
touched
by
death
may
i
like
thee
take
all
my
condescension
in
the
spirit
of
humility
o
modest
soil
thou
are
not
gaudy
like
the
diamond
sparkling
and
dazzling
in
a
brilliant
show
and
living
for
nothing
higher
than
display
but
thou
dost
lay
aside
thy
feathery
tips
leaving
the
sun
of
heaven
do
the
shining
thou
permittest
water

to
give
the
rainbow
hues
whilst
thou
in
thy
own
modest
way
continuest
to
yield
sustenance
for

and

o

wilt
thou
not
in
thy
own
wise
way
speak
to
the
thoughtless
man
who
feels
content
to
grovel
with
the
miserable
diamond
who
takes
his
lessons
from
the
dead
dead
rock
and
feeds
his
soul
upon
such
flinty
food
open
his
ears
to
hear
thy
words
of
life
and

and
may
he
see
in
thee
the
brighter
mirror
reflecting
the
god
of
all
this
one
oration
condensed
is
a
fair
sample
of
the
others
i
listened
to
the
whole
program
and
then
proceeded
once
more
to
view
the
diamond
splendors
before
i
left
this
world
where
i
was
well
paid
for
my
tarrying
chapter
xviii
triumphant
feat
of
orion
as
i
continued
ranging
among
the
planets
of
the
constellation
of
orion
i
felt
an
indescribable
desire
to
pause
at
a
very
small
orb
which
revolves
around
saiph
a
star
of
the
third
magnitude
here
i
found
to
my
surprise
a
gem
of
a
world
which
i
will
call
holen
it
is
five
hundred
miles
in
diameter
and
inhabited
by
a
refined
race
of
human
beings
radically
different
from
us
in
physical
contour
but
remarkably
similar
to
us
in
their
mental
aspirations
as
a
race
they
greatly
excel
us
in
mechanical
engineering
many
evidences
of
their
skill
might
be
given
but
we
will
be
content
to
give
a
description
of
their
monumental
engineering
feat
long
ages
ago
holen
had
cooled
to
the
center
and
it
became
the
ruling
passion
of
her
most
intelligent
inhabitants
to
communicate
from
one
side
of
the
globe
to
the
other
through
an
opening
of
five
hundred
miles
almost
directly
through
the
center
of
their
earth
or
more
accurately
speaking
through
the
center
of
gravity
after
hundred
years
of
experimenting
the
marvelous
feat
was
accomplished
of
all
the
worlds
in
the
constellation
of
orion
large
or
small
holen
is
the
only
one
that
has
succeeded
in
this
astounding
feat
although
it
has
been
and
is
being
tried
on
more
than
a
dozen
worlds
this
wonderful
opening
through
holen
center
of
gravity
is
lined
with
sections
of
ribbed
metal
which
cost
the
governments
fabulous
sums
this
vast
tube
was
finished
thirteen
hundred
years
ago
according
to
our
time
many
lives
were
sacrificed
in
the
hazardous
work
of
tunneling
were
it
not
for
the
ribbed
metal
which
afforded
protection
with
its
shelving
flanges
the
tube
could
never
have
been
finished
at
the
present
time
the
tube
is
used
for
commercial
purposes
and
for
passenger
traffic
air
tight
cars
of
special
design
are
used
and
only
one
car
is
allowed
in
the
tube
at
one
time
illustration
the
of
holen
you
can
not
imagine
the
frightful
velocity
of
the
ride
but
the
passenger
is
not
as
conscious
of
this
as
you
might
think
the
first
fifty
miles
of
the
descent
is
controlled
by
the
exterior
or
surface
engines
the
speed
is
gradually
increased
until
it
reaches
that
of
the
falling
body
then
the
motorman
releases
the
wizard
car
and
the
speed
is
steady
and
terrible
until
the
car
dashes
past
the
center
of
gravity
after
which
the
speed
slackens
at
a
regular
rate
the
car
of
its
own
momentum
forces
its
way
far
toward
the
opposite
surface
of
their
earth
just
as
the
carriage
comes
to
a
stop
the
engineer
or
motorman
as
we
would
call
him
pulls
his
lever
thereby
fastening
the
car
to
the
ribbed
side
of
the
tube
at
once
a
signal
is
given
and
the
long
thin
but
strong
rope
descends
to
draw
the
carriage
to
the
surface
a
perfect
system
of
communication
is
established
from
one
end
of
the
ponderous
tube
to
the
other
it
frequently
happens
when
an
attempt
is
made
to
fasten
the
car
that
the
clamps
fail
to
work
and
consequently
the
carriage
commences
its
second
journey
toward
the
center
another
effort
is
made
to
hold
the
carriage
when
it
again
comes
to
a
stop
but
if
this
is
not
successful
then
comes
the
most
peculiar
experience
of
all
the
carriage
of
its
own
momentum
continues
dashing
backward
and
forward
until
it
comes
to
rest
at
the
center
of
gravity
then
the
engineer
by
communicating
with
the
surface
gets
the
longest
stretch
of
rope
and
is
drawn
two
hundred
and
fifty
miles
to
the
surface
this
world
has
no
atmosphere
and
life
is
not
sustained
by
breathing
neither
by
the
process
found
on
the
moon
the
inhabitants
get
their
sustenance
from
the
soil
with
which
they
must
be
connected
directly
or
indirectly
over
the
time
or
they
will
suffer
in
a
manner
similar
to
us
when
we
are
suffocating
from
this
faint
glimpse
of
their
life
it
can
be
seen
that
the
people
of
holen
in
their
habits
are
totally
incongruous
to
all
our
conceptions
and
if
one
of
them
were
to
make
a
visit
to
our
world
everything
he
would
here
see
would
appear
just
as
ridiculous
and
unthinkable
to
him
as
the
things
on
their
globe
did
to
me
as
i
surveyed
this
world
everything
evidenced
the
fact
that
these
people
are
born
engineers
our
eiffel
tower
and
ferris
wheel
would
be
mere
playthings
compared
with
the
structures
that
adorn
the
various
parts
of
this
little
world
it
appears
that
the
international
mind
runs
in
this
one
direction
more
than
in
any
other
and
while
they
surpass
us
in
this
respect
they
are
inferior
to
us
in
the
limitless
field
of
science
and
philosophy
as
well
as
in
the
variety
of
manufacturing
plants
in
their
religion
the
holenites
have
developed
to
a
high
degree
they
have
no
sacred
book
akin
to
our
bible
their
whole
authority
comes
from
the
lips
of
the
divine
family
as
we
would
term
it
this
family
serves
for
religion
the
same
purpose
as
the
royal
family
does
for
the
civil
realm
in
some
countries
of
our
world
the
divine
family
are
genuinely
descended
from
their
sacred
ancestors
who
were
by
a
visible
show
of
omnipotent
power
appointed
and
consecrated
to
the
sacred
work
of
dispensing
truth
and
officiating
in
all
sacraments
the
ordination
of
all
the
ministers
of
holen
must
be
held
by
a
member
of
this
divine
family
by
reason
of
this
one
source
of
authority
there
is
therefore
no
confliction
of
creeds
the
great
battle
of
the
church
is
with
the
several
infidel
organizations
that
give
no
heed
to
the
genuine
religion
this
sacred
family
received
a
code
of
laws
which
they
have
held
from
the
beginning
and
strange
to
say
no
one
is
allowed
to
copy
these
laws
in
written
or
printed
form
to
do
so
is
a
type
of
blasphemy
for
which
a
severe
penalty
is
imposed
some
of
the
infidel
organizations
find
delight
to
print
all
or
a
part
of
these
laws
and
scatter
them
secretly
among
the
people
such
documents
fall
with
as
much
pain
on
the
premises
of
a
believer
as
oaths
do
in
our
world
on
the
ear
of
a
delicately
trained
soul
if
an
infidel
wishes
to
insult
a
godly
pilgrim
he
can
do
it
no
more
effectively
than
by
secretly
fastening
to
the
believer
residence
a
piece
of
material
on
which
is
inscribed
one
or
more
of
these
sacred
laws
every
believer
is
required
to
commit
to
memory
this
code
of
laws
by
hearing
them
from
the
lips
of
the
minister
it
is
therefore
necessary
to
keep
in
constant
touch
with
the
church
service
so
as
to
be
a
continual
hearer
of
these
laws
a
part
of
which
is
repeated
every
worship
day
the
minister
does
not
preach
in
the
same
sense
that
we
understand
preaching
his
work
comes
nearer
filling
the
office
of
a
priest
under
the
old
jewish
church
there
is
much
more
form
and
ceremony
than
is
found
in
our
system
under
the
mediator
jesus
christ
the
civil
law
has
absolutely
nothing
to
say
on
the
marriage
question
all
this
is
held
in
the
domain
of
the
church
in
truth
the
divine
family
has
always
regulated
this
question
if
the
legality
of
a
marriage
is
called
in
question
all
that
the
civil
authorities
try
to
determine
is
whether
the
marriage
ceremony
was
performed
in
accordance
with
the
laws
of
the
divine
family
if
this
point
can
be
established
the
marriage
is
declared
legal
if
not
it
is
declared
to
be
null
and
void
this
one
subject
of
matrimony
has
caused
more
friction
between
the
church
and
the
infidels
than
all
other
issues
combined
the
infidels
are
bitterly
opposed
to
take
their
marriage
vows
before
the
minister
yet
this
must
be
done
to
make
their
marriage
legal
divorce
laws
are
unknown
although
in
rare
cases
papers
of
separation
are
granted
by
authority
and
under
seal
of
the
divine
family
the
religious
devotees
of
holen
look
forward
to
a
happier
existence
when
their
mortal
life
is
ended
their
ideas
of
this
future
life
are
quite
similar
to
our
cherished
ideas
of
heaven
in
their
moral
life
they
have
reached
a
higher
plane
than
we
this
is
due
to
the
fact
that
the
divine
family
wield
an
influence
in
the
civil
realm
that
can
not
be
broken
chapter
xix
the
mute
world
i
proceeded
on
my
journey
until
i
had
reached
alcyone
in
the
famous
constellation
of
taurus
on
one
of
the
planets
revolving
around
alcyone
i
found
a
distinctive
class
of
human
beings
faintly
resembling
creatures
that
i
had
seen
in
several
other
constellations
but
of
which
i
have
as
yet
made
no
special
mention
among
these
people
no
audible
language
is
used
as
a
means
of
communication
one
might
think
that
high
civilization
would
be
impossible
without
such
a
vehicle
of
thought
but
on
this
mute
world
humanity
has
pushed
far
along
in
the
great
interstellar
race
for
supremacy
a
description
of
the
physical
features
of
these
muteites
would
not
only
seem
absurd
but
would
be
distorting
can
you
imagine
a
beautiful
person
without
ears
and
void
of
vocal
sound
having
a
head
totally
out
of
shape
compared
with
ours
and
with
a
bodily
framework
ridiculously
new
to
us
such
would
be
a
brief
word
sketch
of
these
mortals
of
unusual
intelligence
these
people
hold
all
their
conversation
by
pure
thought
transmission
the
is
almost
infinitely
keen
and
gestures
play
no
part
in
emphasizing
thought
it
is
amazing
to
see
with
what
facility
these
beings
express
their
ideas
one
to
another
in
our
life
one
may
conceal
his
thoughts
from
the
most
searching
human
eye
but
this
can
not
be
done
on
mute
as
a
consequence
each
one
can
read
the
character
of
his
comrades
and
the
normal
citizen
well
knows
what
necessary
allowance
to
make
for
the
impure
thoughts
that
flit
through
the
mind
of
his
neighbor
i
studied
with
absorbing
interest
the
many
phases
of
this
mental
telepathy
or
mind
talking
between
two
or
more
persons
even
though
widely
separated
imagine
how
glorious
it
must
be
to
have
real
fellowship
with
a
friend
whose
face
you
can
not
see
and
whose
hand
you
can
not
touch
there
are
limitations
to
this
delightsome
way
of
talking
a
person
can
hold
conversation
with
only
one
absent
friend
at
a
time
and
then
only
when
each
one
concentrates
his
thoughts
on
the
other
what
wireless
telegraphy
is
to
our
world
this
mental
conversation
is
to
the
world
of
mute
and
it
is
possible
that
we
may
reach
a
higher
degree
of
proficiency
in
this
direction
after
we
become
still
better
acquainted
with
the
laws
of
the
human
mind
when
i
think
of
the
many
unaccountable
that
send
their
emotions
of
joy
and
hatred
into
our
passing
life
i
am
somewhat
persuaded
that
we
speak
this
tongueless
language
more
than
we
imagine
some
day
we
may
learn
the
secrets
that
are
now
so
heavily
veiled
and
thereby
put
to
naught
the
glory
of
our
present
modes
of
communication
until
then
we
will
plod
along
with
the
telegraph
telephone
wireless
telegraphy
and
our
knowledge
of
telepathic
intercourse
i
will
give
the
philosophy
of
this
perfect
means
of
expressing
thought
as
clearly
as
i
can
as
sound
waves
are
created
in
our
atmosphere
by
actual
vibration
so
are
thought
waves
created
on
mute
by
mental
activity
focused
in
any
one
point
of
the
brain
our
way
of
expressing
thought
by
audible
words
is
not
conceivable
to
these
people
if
one
of
their
inhabitants
were
to
visit
our
earth
he
would
be
at
a
loss
to
account
for
our
movements
of
mouth
and
gestures
of
body
when
we
are
in
the
act
of
conversation
the
social
life
of
mute
is
marked
with
many
peculiarities
males
and
females
seldom
ever
associate
together
and
social
purity
sends
its
sweet
influences
over
the
whole
planet
a
science
which
is
similar
to
phrenology
plays
an
important
part
in
all
the
social
customs
of
this
sphere
it
decides
the
marital
destiny
of
each
person
and
no
two
are
recommended
to
join
in
wedlock
until
they
have
been
pronounced
physical
and
mental
mates
by
the
official
psychologists
on
this
interesting
world
i
found
the
most
summary
punishment
for
adulterers
and
fornicators
when
these
crimes
are
clearly
proven
the
guilty
parties
are
put
to
death
after
a
lingering
sentence
this
is
a
most
terrible
punishment
but
it
has
proven
that
although
a
few
must
suffer
this
penalty
the
general
good
of
the
whole
population
is
thereby
much
increased
i
was
much
amazed
at
the
construction
and
possibilities
of
the
human
mind
when
i
observed
the
manner
in
which
certain
suspected
criminals
were
examined
in
order
to
prove
or
disprove
the
crime
of
which
they
were
charged
the
doors
of
the
soul
were
unlocked
and
the
past
with
their
mental
impressions
were
thrown
open
to
view
how
can
a
muteite
deny
the
crime
which
is
photographed
on
the
sensitive
living
plates
of
his
own
mind
this
reproducing
can
be
effected
only
by
a
very
special
process
and
is
never
done
against
a
person
will
unless
ordered
by
civil
authority
when
i
saw
on
this
world
of
mute
the
possibility
of
uncovering
the
past
records
of
the
mind
it
at
once
suggested
to
me
the
possible
nature
of
the
final
judgment
of
our
world
when
each
one
will
stand
face
to
face
with
the
record
of
his
own
deeds
brought
before
him
vividly
under
the
light
of
eternity
in
such
an
event
who
would
think
of
showing
a
bold
front
to
deny
the
accuracy
of
such
a
direct
reproduction
of
himself
in
the
flesh
possibly
the
human
mind
may
be
likened
to
a
phonograph
into
which
we
can
speak
while
the
cylinder
of
thought
revolves
at
any
time
afterward
every
syllable
may
be
reproduced
accurately
another
striking
feature
of
these
mortals
is
their
lack
of
hypocrisy
only
a
small
degree
of
it
is
found
among
all
the
inhabitants
of
this
peculiar
planet
no
doubt
hypocrisy
would
be
greatly
lessened
in
our
own
social
life
if
we
could
no
longer
hide
our
real
thoughts
in
mute
it
is
very
unsafe
to
practice
deception
for
as
soon
as
the
deceived
one
appears
personally
he
can
readily
conjecture
by
the
mental
state
of
the
deceiver
the
nature
of
the
thought
that
had
transpired
can
you
realize
what
a
refreshing
moral
atmosphere
exists
in
a
world
where
conventional
lying
is
almost
unknown
in
our
life
the
daily
sin
of
the
millions
is
the
white
or
the
blue
lie
think
of
how
many
we
tell
in
our
regular
routine
of
life
we
generally
give
false
excuses
instead
of
the
real
ones
we
very
seldom
blame
ourselves
for
errors
but
rather
think
diligently
to
study
out
a
way
to
shift
responsibility
nearly
the
whole
brood
of
our
apologies
is
hatched
from
the
serpent
egg
and
then
we
ignorantly
or
hypocritically
manifest
surprise
that
our
own
offspring
should
develop
an
inclination
to
deceive
or
misrepresent
here
i
saw
in
wide
contrast
to
our
own
social
order
the
results
springing
from
sincerity
that
has
thrived
through
a
long
line
of
generations
such
blessings
are
as
a
breath
of
heaven
rare
and
beautiful
one
might
think
when
considering
this
strange
manner
of
conversation
that
it
would
be
difficult
for
the
people
to
express
their
ideas
clearly
it
is
just
the
opposite
from
this
for
it
is
almost
impossible
for
them
to
express
themselves
vaguely
they
talk
from
the
headquarters
of
one
mind
directly
to
the
headquarters
of
another
instead
of
through
a
medium
of
cumbersome
words
which
in
our
life
are
so
often
misunderstood
thus
we
must
admit
that
we
have
a
greater
struggle
than
they
to
be
perspicuous
in
language
i
was
charmed
at
this
most
superior
mode
of
conversation
and
saw
in
it
a
higher
glimpse
of
the
heaven
language
than
in
any
other
type
that
had
yet
met
my
observation
in
all
the
worlds
of
space
the
muteites
are
rapid
thinkers
and
although
they
have
no
sense
of
hearing
yet
they
are
to
substantial
emissions
of
vibrating
bodies
according
to
all
i
could
see
these
people
were
not
hampered
by
this
lack
of
senses
they
live
as
conveniently
in
their
flesh
life
as
we
do
and
in
their
mind
or
spirit
life
they
are
much
more
refined
than
we
are
their
earth
is
so
different
from
ours
in
chemical
combinations
that
the
soil
is
almost
transparent
and
in
general
has
the
appearance
of
glass
their
homes
are
built
mostly
under
surface
owing
to
the
terrific
cyclonic
storms
that
follow
one
another
in
very
uncertain
succession
the
average
length
of
life
is
two
hundred
of
our
years
they
reach
their
maximum
energy
of
mind
at
about
one
hundred
years
and
among
the
brighter
of
the
inhabitants
can
be
found
a
glorious
order
of
intellect
some
of
these
mental
celebrities
outshine
the
brightest
creatures
of
all
the
solar
systems
of
that
region
of
the
heavens
after
some
hesitancy
i
yielded
to
a
desire
to
appear
in
a
visible
form
before
an
assembled
company
of
muteite
philosophers
who
were
gathered
in
one
of
the
halls
of
architectural
beauty
for
consultation
as
i
entered
the
vast
hall
in
my
natural
manner
i
attracted
unusual
attention
it
was
amusing
to
see
how
all
eyes
were
fastened
upon
me
as
i
calmly
walked
toward
the
front
of
the
audience
here
i
had
one
of
the
hardest
tasks
of
all
my
journey
to
converse
in
a
soundless
language
i
lacked
faith
at
first
to
make
the
attempt
but
this
delay
was
but
for
a
moment
for
i
first
fixed
my
mind
upon
what
i
wished
to
communicate
and
instantly
a
dozen
or
more
muteites
signified
that
they
were
in
sensitive
touch
with
my
thought
i
will
give
a
small
portion
of
the
mental
telepathic
conversation
between
myself
and
my
auditors
although
i
must
relate
it
as
if
words
were
actually
spoken
or
it
would
be
totally
unintelligible
to
the
people
of
my
own
likeness
let
no
one
be
alarmed
i
hurriedly
addressed
them
as
a
thousand
giant
forms
were
trembling
at
my
appearance
my
mission
is
one
of
peace
i
have
come
to
help
rather
than
harm
i
continued
from
what
section
of
our
world
have
you
come
came
a
hundred
thought
flashes
in
wild
confusion
i
am
not
from
your
world
but
from
another
i
answered
with
closed
mouth
as
best
i
could
then
i
learned
an
important
feature
of
this
mind
language
a
hundred
or
more
interrogations
came
flying
at
me
in
thick
confusion
at
once
the
chairman
or
leader
of
the
meeting
gave
restrictive
orders
which
actually
prohibited
my
audience
from
further
communication
with
me
although
i
might
address
them
the
chairman
bid
me
commune
with
him
and
he
thereafter
acted
as
the
spokesman
of
the
whole
assembly
it
was
no
more
difficult
for
these
philosophers
to
keep
their
minds
closed
to
me
than
it
is
for
us
to
keep
our
mouths
closed
in
an
excitable
meeting
or
debate
the
chairman
looking
with
increasing
curiosity
at
my
strangely
shaped
face
and
head
interrogated
me
thus
are
you
an
angel
of
light
or
one
of
darkness
i
am
neither
what
then
can
you
be
i
am
a
created
being
from
a
region
of
space
i
was
born
on
a
world
which
revolves
around
a
star
untold
millions
of
miles
distant
if
you
are
not
a
spirit
how
could
you
have
traveled
such
incredible
distances
that
is
yet
a
mystery
to
me
i
admitted
the
power
of
my
flight
is
much
like
the
mode
of
your
communication
for
each
is
alike
mysterious
to
me
by
this
time
the
excitement
was
intense
no
one
attempted
to
grasp
me
or
even
approach
toward
me
i
saw
by
the
perplexing
mental
atmosphere
of
the
chairman
that
he
was
being
besieged
by
a
host
of
questions
and
suggestions
so
i
relieved
the
situation
by
continuing
my
words
no
one
need
consider
my
appearance
as
an
evil
omen
i
am
not
empowered
to
curse
or
bless
your
world
except
by
what
may
flow
from
my
immediate
conversation
with
you
in
these
sentences
i
thoughtlessly
gestured
with
my
arms
this
set
my
audience
wild
with
mingled
merriment
and
curiosity
are
all
as
small
as
you
whence
you
came
queried
the
chairman
they
are
all
after
my
pattern
with
some
variations
pray
tell
me
what
are
those
gummy
flabs
at
the
sides
of
your
head
those
are
my
ears
i
said
with
grinning
face
they
grew
there
for
a
purpose
and
what
can
that
purpose
be
further
questioned
the
puzzled
chairman
they
are
for
the
purpose
of
hearing
i
quickly
replied
then
followed
a
curious
scientific
dialogue
in
which
i
endeavored
to
explain
the
sense
of
hearing
from
this
i
described
the
manner
of
conversation
in
our
world
and
showed
what
an
important
part
hearing
played
but
all
this
was
beyond
the
comprehension
of
my
auditors
after
a
lengthy
and
most
interesting
discussion
upon
the
philosophy
of
sound
the
next
point
of
interest
centered
on
my
mouth
and
vocal
organs
it
was
pleasing
to
consider
these
subjects
because
my
listeners
were
such
eager
questioners
and
surprised
hearers
no
wonder
that
they
were
unable
to
grasp
such
a
crude
system
of
conversation
as
ours
then
the
chairman
verily
begged
me
to
explain
the
mystery
of
my
mission
and
of
my
unprecedented
itinerary
how
could
i
have
fully
satisfied
his
mind
even
if
i
had
endeavored
to
do
so
after
all
this
came
the
most
pleasing
communion
thus
far
of
all
my
journey
i
learned
much
by
the
interchange
of
ideas
nature
vast
book
opened
to
me
some
new
and
charming
pages
toward
the
close
of
my
stay
the
affinity
between
us
grew
to
a
marked
degree
although
we
were
widely
apart
in
physical
aspect
yet
we
were
supping
from
the
same
bowl
of
affection
and
with
this
happy
turn
we
talked
of
our
permanent
companionship
but
i
can
not
abide
with
you
i
reluctantly
answered
ah
torment
us
not
with
such
a
thought
affectingly
pressed
the
chairman
i
have
other
worlds
to
visit
and
must
hasten
away
touch
me
not
i
cried
as
the
chairman
unconsciously
moved
toward
me
in
an
urgent
appeal
how
soon
shall
we
see
you
again
no
more
forever
unless
you
see
me
in
that
widest
expanse
of
life
which
in
our
world
we
call
heaven
there
the
pure
of
all
worlds
will
gather
and
commingle
in
delightsome
fellowship
forever
i
was
then
urged
beyond
all
etiquette
to
tarry
a
short
period
and
visit
certain
parts
of
their
world
but
i
informed
them
that
i
had
seen
more
of
their
world
than
they
imagined
and
that
the
object
of
my
visit
had
been
reached
chapter
xx
brief
one
of
the
medium
sized
worlds
that
revolve
around
alcyone
sustains
the
shortest
lived
human
beings
of
our
universe
it
is
seldom
that
any
of
the
creatures
reach
more
than
four
years
of
age
according
to
our
standards
of
time
they
are
nearly
as
large
as
we
and
relatively
much
lighter
in
weight
all
the
periods
of
physical
growth
are
correspondingly
decreased
children
walk
four
or
five
weeks
after
birth
and
are
capable
of
receiving
regular
instruction
at
the
age
of
five
months
strange
as
it
may
seem
this
sphere
which
for
convenience
we
will
call
brief
revolves
very
slowly
on
its
axis
so
that
our
world
makes
fifteen
times
as
many
revolutions
as
this
planet
it
requires
but
little
arithmetic
to
figure
out
that
the
people
of
brief
do
not
see
the
sun
rise
very
often
when
it
does
appear
in
the
morning
sky
all
the
public
signals
blow
and
the
people
appear
in
one
or
another
of
their
places
of
worship
this
beautiful
custom
has
been
in
practice
for
over
three
thousand
years
the
worship
is
not
sun
worship
but
a
genuine
service
of
thanksgiving
to
him
who
ruleth
over
the
sun
and
supplies
it
with
fuel
to
burn
it
appears
that
on
all
worlds
everything
is
regulated
in
accordance
with
the
length
of
human
life
on
this
world
of
brief
all
vegetables
mature
in
periods
so
short
that
one
marvels
when
he
hears
it
think
of
cereals
reaching
maturity
in
seven
or
eight
of
our
days
or
during
one
day
of
brief
early
in
the
morning
certain
crops
are
planted
and
are
harvested
at
night
two
or
more
days
are
required
for
maturing
other
crops
actually
the
people
of
brief
raise
their
crops
with
less
labor
than
is
required
amongst
us
if
you
were
permitted
to
look
upon
the
public
and
private
life
of
this
incredible
world
your
first
sensation
would
be
dizziness
not
to
mention
the
weirdness
of
all
sights
that
would
confront
you
at
every
turn
people
would
seem
to
be
in
a
mad
rush
and
it
would
appear
that
all
business
is
done
with
insane
rapidity
furrows
of
care
and
trouble
begin
to
deepen
on
the
faces
of
these
briefites
as
they
approach
an
age
of
what
we
would
call
three
years
and
if
by
lease
of
strength
they
pass
on
toward
an
age
of
four
years
it
is
but
an
evidence
of
their
exceptional
vitality
it
seems
to
be
true
that
the
experiences
of
a
long
life
of
sixty
or
eighty
years
is
crowded
into
a
narrow
compass
of
four
years
by
a
miracle
of
spheres
not
comprehended
by
finite
minds
no
doubt
a
detailed
description
of
this
whirling
and
dashing
life
would
be
of
interest
to
us
slow
deliberate
creatures
but
i
can
give
only
a
passing
glimpse
journalism
things
happen
in
such
quick
succession
that
the
news
is
hustled
out
at
all
hours
of
the
day
and
night
not
on
sheets
of
paper
but
through
automatic
machines
somewhat
akin
to
our
telegraph
instruments
the
state
supplies
each
home
with
an
automatic
thus
a
record
is
kept
in
each
home
of
all
messages
received
so
that
they
can
be
read
at
leisure
to
speak
in
a
manner
more
easily
understood
i
will
say
that
the
news
is
telegraphed
to
each
home
as
soon
as
possible
after
the
events
transpire
but
compared
to
our
customs
the
news
is
very
scarce
there
being
no
competition
no
time
or
space
is
required
for
sensational
trash
thus
if
nothing
of
importance
occurs
nothing
need
be
transmitted
the
official
decide
as
to
the
relative
importance
of
occurrences
there
need
not
be
a
certain
amount
of
news
telegraphed
each
hour
the
government
verifies
as
much
as
possible
all
reports
before
they
are
transmitted
there
are
indeed
some
advantages
in
the
government
being
in
constant
touch
with
each
home
under
its
care
the
advertising
department
pays
nearly
all
expenses
of
this
whole
system
of
journalism
announcements
for
private
gain
are
paid
at
a
regular
rate
it
costs
more
to
advertise
at
certain
periods
than
at
other
times
all
regulated
by
the
customs
of
the
people
under
these
regulations
everybody
receives
the
news
and
only
the
essential
news
except
advertisements
which
must
come
in
batches
at
certain
intervals
of
course
people

their
choice

illustration
sunrise

in

their
footwear
the
soles
of
the
feet
of
these
briefites
are
composed
of
a
substance
most
nearly
resembling
hoof
material
they
never
think
of
covering
the
feet
under
any
change
of
climate
if
one
of
the
briefites
were
to
step
upon
the
shores
of
our
rugged
earth
and
see
the
cotton
or
wool
and
leather
that
lies
around
our
feet
it
would
appear
to
him
as
the
most
ridiculous
thing
imaginable
and
no
doubt
his
shapely
feet
of
ivory
cast
would
be
of
more
than
passing
interest
to
us
their
raiment
their
raiment
is
altogether
after
new
models
neither
the
men

nor
children
seem
to
seek
this

for
they
seem
to
think
that
beauty
of
character
has
a
radiance
more
to
be
desired
than
the
flash
of
opals
or
the
luster
of
silks
their
garments
partake
of
the
loose
flowing
order
for
instance
a
strong
fabric
of
chosen
shade
is
fastened
at
the
neck
hip
knee
and
ankle
and
lies
carelessly
over
the
parts
between
the
females
never
graduated
to
the
corset
degree
and
while
they
do
not
cut
a
scientific
figure

they
surely
develop
a
more
ruddy
waist

the
model
intended
by
the

transportation
the
methods
of
traveling
are
so
contrary
to
our
conceptions
and
practices
that
i
almost
forbear
to
attempt
any
description
yet
i
was
entertained
and
instructed
as
i
witnessed
the
moving
of
humanity
along
a
street
of
a
busy
city
have
you
ever
noticed
how
quarters
of
beef
are
carried
from
a
car
to
an
elevator
or
refrigerator
on
steel
rods
connected
with
wheels
running
in
a
groove
or
on
a
specially
prepared
track
in
a
city
of
brief
overhead
tracks
after
such
an
order
run
along
all
business
streets
and
certain
residence
streets
spare
me
a
detailed
description
of
this
peculiar
traveling
system
suffice
it
to
say
that
a
person
in
lightning
rapidity
of
motion
rushes
from
a
store
springs
upon
a
passing
seat
and
is
hurled
away
by
the
power
of
an
overhead
cable
system
when
an
exchange
of
seats
is
necessary
it
is
all
done
so
easily
and
so
quickly
that
you
would
wonder
why
we
tolerate
trolley
cars
in
traveling
from
city
to
city
a
system
is
in
use
that
i
will
call
the
toboggan
slide
system
although
the
cars
run
on
wheels
the
car
is
raised
in
a
shaft
about
one
hundred
feet
and
then
by
gravity
it
dashes
two
or
more
miles
according
to
the
lay
of
the
land
traversed
then
another
rise
more
or
less
than
one
hundred
feet
is
experienced
and
then
another
wild
dash
i
have
no
words
of
praise
for
this
system
although
the
briefites
can
cover
considerable
territory
in
an
hour
they
look
upon
this
gravity
system
as
a
wonderful
achievement
for
it
has
not
been
in
operation
for
more
than
three
hundred
years
the
power
of
steam
has
never
been
utilized
no
genius
of
all
this
active
world
of
brief
ever
conceived
the
idea
that
almost
unlimited
power
lies
wrapped
up
in
thin
vapory
water
but
they
have
discovered
what
we
would
call
gaseous
oil
and
have
learned
to
put
it
to
work
so
that
it
is
the
main
force
employed
in
hoisting
and
all
other
purposes
where
power
is
required
nothing
like
a
traveling
locomotive
has
ever
been
made
although
i
learned
that
a
bright
wizard
was
experimenting
and
that
he
prophesied
great
changes
when
his
vehicle
was
perfected
think
of
how
much
value
an
ordinary
citizen
of
our
world
would
be
to
these
briefites
if
he
could
step
upon
their
world
and
communicate
with
them
concerning
the
magic
wonders
of
steam
and
the
manner
of
constructing
stationary
and
movable
engines
to
say
nothing
of
the
hidden
wonders
of
electricity
quadrupeds
that
take
the
place
of
our
horses
are
used
for
drayage
although
nothing
except
the
class
of
vehicles
was
ever
used
until
some
years
ago
public
highways
these
interesting
people
excel
us
in
their
style
and
manner
of
fencing
and
making
public
highways
we
are
heathenish
in
our
progress
along
the
line
of
road
making
especially
in
all
my
vast
journey
among
the
worlds
i
found
only
a
few
comparatively
whereon
the
roads
were
inferior
to
ours
in
the
world
of
brief
the
state
prescribes
the
manner
of
public
highways
and
each
citizen
must
contribute
his
share
to
their
creation
and
maintenance
these
briefites
excel
us
in
more
than
a
score
of
ways
they
are
much
purer
in
morals
more
refined
in
manner
more
harmonious
in
government
and
unusually
bright
in
mathematics
very
intricate
and
elaborate
problems
are
solved
by
these
people
of
a
few
years
they
are
inferior
to
us
in
a
hundred
ways
in
the
broad
fields
of
manufacture
and
invention
they
lag
a
long
distance
in
the
rear
this
is
principally
due
to
their
lack
of
time
religious
life
the
religious
life
of
the
people
of
brief
is
on
an
average
of
a
higher
type
than
is
found
in
our
world
their
belief
in
immortality
has
run
parallel
with
their
existence
as
a
people
and
their
devotion
to
their
creator
is
marked
with
unusual
fervor
their
redeemer
is
worshiped
quite
separately
from
god
and
with
distinctive
adorations
the
name
of
their
redeemer
phonetically
rendered
is
the
most
faithful
translation
of
this
word
into
our
language
would
be
or
appeared
upon
brief
full
grown
and
pronounced
his
benediction
on
the
race
declaring
his
origin
and
the
purpose
of
his
coming
similar
to
christ
he
confirmed
his
identity
by
unanswerable
miracles
many
however
disbelieved
in
and
held
to
the
old
axiomatic
truths
thus
creeds
were
prevalent
and
they
remain
until
now
only
there
is
much
less
variety
than
is
found
amongst
us
set
up
a
new
reign
and
accepted
a
temporal
throne
for
a
season
he
finally
announced
that
his
ambassadorship
would
soon
cease
and
that
his
followers
would
lose
the
throne
of
civil
power
that
they
would
be
tested
for
a
season
in
the
valley
of
humiliation
and
by
the
fires
of
terrible
persecution
and
that
they
who
would
endure
unto
the
end
would
be
glorified
these
religious
features
are
remarkably
similar
to
the
system
under
which
the
christian
religion
of
our
globe
is
fostered
chapter
xxi
the
life
on
wings
as
i
darted
from
world
to
world
i
was
not
then
fully
conscious
of
the
vast
stretches
of
space
that
i
had
covered
no
mortal
nor
angel
tongue
can
even
commence
to
describe
the
vastness
of
created
things
and
the
trackless
oceans
of
space
in
which
the
ponderous
suns
and
planets
revolve
according
to
the
classification
of
our
astronomers
i
next
found
myself
in
the
constellation
of
perseus
and
was
again
convinced
of
the
weakness
of
our
most
powerful
telescopes
for
i
now
saw
thousands
of
immense
stars
hitherto
invisible
to
me
not
one
of
these
stars
is
within
a
trillion
miles
of
any
other
in
this
distant
system
of
our
universe
i
saw
that
the
same
plan
of
creation
obtained
around
a
majority
of
the
stars
a
group
of
various
sized
worlds
revolves
on
many
of
these
worlds
human
life
abounds
in
endless
degrees
of
development
and
in
a
countless
variety
of
manifestations
i
marveled
anew
as
i
saw
the
endlessness
of
the
infinite
mind
supporting
not
only
the
conscious
life
of
this
whole
constellation
but
also
of
all
the
constellations
of
our
universe
and
of
all
the
universes
scattered
at
large
throughout
the
unending
depths
of
space
i
paused
at
a
star
of
variable
magnitude
in
the
milky
way
but
took
only
a
passing
glance
at
the
physical
wonders
of
this
great
sun
compared
with
which
our
own
sun
is
a
mere
pigmy
onward
i
hastened
to
one
of
the
larger
worlds
of
this
solar
system
which
for
my
convenience
i
will
call
swift
here
new
wonders
opened
wide
to
my
view
human
beings
charmingly
beautiful
moved
over
the
face
of
the
planet
or
on
wings
through
the
air
at
pleasure
and
with
great
ease
these
creatures
are
about
of
our
size
and
are
most
gracefully
formed
their
whole
physical
appearance
is
more
similar
to
a
bird
than
to
a
human
being
of
our
earth
they
are
relatively
much
lighter
than
we
and
are
covered
with
nothing
akin
to
feathers
if
you
were
to
see
them
standing
in
their
erect
posture
and
walking
with
dignity
you
would
at
once
feel
that
they
are
the
lords
of
the
creation
on
their
world
and
so
indeed
they
are
these
ethereal
creatures
have
the
loveliest
eyes
of
any
human
beings
i
ever
beheld
in
any
world
they
sparkle
with
the
brilliancy
of
a
diamond
and
move
with
the
quickness
of
electricity
the
head
is
small
but
symmetrical
and
all
physical
proportions
are
most
harmoniously
adapted
even
to
a
nicety
that
would
be
pleasing
to
the
most
refined
tastes
of
our
world
at
first
i
could
not
understand
how
these
people
of
swift
could
travel
so
conveniently
in
the
air
for
their
wings
are
very
small
and
the
exertion
when
flying
is
very
limited
but
the
lightness
of
the
body
the
heaviness
of
the
air
and
the
unusual
strength
of
the
swiftites
each
conduces
its
share
to
the
fortunate
result
in
my
thoughtlessness
i
envied
these
gifted
people
and
wished
that
when
i
would
return
to
my
world
i
could
enjoy
such
privileges
of
flight
i
soon
checked
this
rising
covetousness
and
again
contentment
flung
over
me
its
white
mantle
the
bodies
of
these
swiftites
are
covered
by
nature
with
a
clean
growth
of
soft
silken
hair
they
change
their
garments
with
the
seasons
but
at
all
times
dress
very
sparingly
and
neatly
they
are
so
easily
clothed
that
all
their
apparel
occasions
them
no
more
trouble
than
the
more
seasonable
covering
of
the
head
gives
to
our
women
the
average
length
of
life
is
nearly
four
hundred
years
of
our
time
there
are
very
few
worlds
in
space
where
the
general
health
of
its
inhabitants
is
as
perfect
as
is
found
on
this
beautiful
planet
there
are
but
few
doctors
because
there
is
but
little
demand
for
them
those
who
are
engaged
are
under
government
service
and
all
persons
who
are
unfortunate
enough
to
become
ill
receive
at
least
all
medicine
and
professional
attention
free
we
are
quite
an
exceptional
world
in
our
medical
system
in
all
my
journey
i
saw
comparatively
only
a
few
worlds
that
have
the
private
system
of
medical
treatment
have
we
not
noted
the
laboring
husband
bending
at
his
toil
for
eight
or
ten
hours
to
pay
the
physician
who
calls
for
a
few
minutes
in
some
cases
this
program
is
continued
for
weeks
until
the
honest
toiler
finds
himself
confronted
with
a
bill
and
medicine
bill
to
haunt
him
until
the
debt
is
either
forgiven
or
paid
at
great
sacrifice
on
the
world
of
swift
and
in
the
vast
majority
of
civilized
worlds
in
space
the
community
or
government
furnishes
a
salaried
physician
within
reasonable
reach
of
every
home
the
doctors
of
swift
are
not
expected
to
work
night
and
day
they
have
shifts
to
divide
the
toil
equally
in
architecture
this
distant
planet
excels
us
by
far
i
improved
the
opportunity
and
went
to
witness
a
magnificent
temple
of
worship
which
has
been
in
process
of
erection
for
over
two
hundred
years
any
conceit
that
i
previously
had
on
account
of
the
large
structures
of
my
own
world
quickly
vanished
at
the
sight
of
this
imposing
edifice
during
my
visit
the
winged
workers
were
laboring
on
the
upper
stories
and
i
watched
them
with
great
wonderment
as
they
descended
from
the
clouds
to
carry
materials
to
the
higher
stories
can
you
imagine
the
picture
of
workmen
flying
in
all
directions
with
tools
each
one
busily
employed
it
is
promised
that
the
present
generation
of
employees
will
live
to
see
the
completion
of
this
notable
structure
this
vast
building
is
the
national
religious
center
of
the
swiftites
each
government
has
such
a
central
station
and
from
it
all
temples
of
worship
are
controlled
here
the
church
and
the
state
are
yet
married
and
the
state
maintains
its
religious
departments
with
careful
scrutiny
the
chief
ambition
of
each
government
has
always
been
to
outshine
the
others
in
the
glory
and
magnificence
of
its
central
temple
which
of
course
is
fire
proof
and
almost
time
proof
one
may
wonder
as
he
gazes
upon
this
extensive
structure
why
there
are
seventy
thousand
sleeping
rooms
and
dining
halls
built
after
such
extensive
plans
as
to
entertain
at
one
time
thousand
guests
all
this
is
to
accommodate
the
vast
throngs
that
take
their
sacred
pilgrimage
once
in
a
year
under
an
arrangement
by
which
one
tenth
of
the
go
each
days
which
corresponds
to
our
month
the
most
notable
feature
of
this
central
temple
is
the
main
service
room
built
at
fabulous
cost
and
capable
of
accommodating
one
hundred
thousand
pilgrims
at
one
time
the
most
costly
sections
of
this
one
room
are
guarded
night
and
day
by
armed
government
soldiers
the
religion
of
these
swiftites
is
of
a
very
pure
kind
the
ministers
of
this
national
church
are
fully
equipped
before
entering
upon
their
office
the
training
schools
for
ministers
attracted
my
closest
attention
fortunately
these
people
have
no
language
complications
as
we
have
so
that
a
prospective
minister
can
spend
some
of
his
time
studying
the
book
of
god
revelation
instead
of
spending
a
great
portion
of
his
training
period
in
learning
the
languages
in
which
the
book
had
once
been
written
a
minister
training
consists
as
much
in
voice
culture
and
the
many
branches
of
elocution
as
it
does
in
acquiring
a
correct
knowledge
of
god
but
in
illustrative
teaching
swift
leads
us
by
far
i
was
profitably
entertained
in
the
main
temple
as
i
listened
to
one
of
the
famous
orators
discoursing
to
an
audience
of
eighty
thousand
not
only
did
his
voice
penetrate
to
all
parts
of
the
large
room
but
his
objective
illustrations
clinched
the
truth
remarkably
well
a
series
of
special
services
is
held
at
the
close
of
each
month
the
most
wonderful
of
all
these
exercises
or
renditions
is
called
the
mediator
service
this
is
one
of
the
most
spectacular
and
impressive
exercises
outside
of
heaven
even
the
famous
passion
play
of
oberammergau
our
world
with
the
less
glorious
exhibitions
at
horitz
and
selzach
all
dwindle
into
insignificance
compared
with
the
mediator
service
on
the
world
of
swift
during
my
visit
i
witnessed
the
full
program
of
this
sublime
rendition
the
music
was
inexpressibly
grand
as
rendered
by
the
vested
mediator
choir
naturally
the
swiftites
have
sweet
voices
can
you
conceive
the
effect
of
a
triple
choir
of
these
human
warblers
all
trained
in
perfect
harmony
and
unison
when
you
consider
that
nearly
the
whole
population
witnesses
these
special
exhibitions
at
least
once
a
year
you
can
the
better
understand
why
the
spiritual
condition
of
the
people
has
reached
a
high
very
level
i
investigated
the
many
interesting
features
of
this
inviting
world
and
found
that
in
some
respects
we
are
inferior
to
these
human
bird
creatures
although
in
many
other
respects
we
are
superior
electricity
is
known
in
their
world
but
they
have
not
yet
harnessed
it
hence
they
are
ignorant
of
telegraphy
and
a
long
list
of
similar
inventions
which
we
enjoy
in
agriculture
the
swiftites
are
ahead
of
us
they
raise
their
crops
with
less
labor
relatively
than
we
all
things
considered
it
is
easier
to
live
on
swift
than
here
knowing
that
my
time
was
limited
i
decided
to
secure
some
nuggets
of
truth
by
a
personal
interview
so
i
concluded
to
appear
to
the
wisest
person
on
the
planet
who
was
a
woman
of
wonderful
mental
acquirements
in
addition
to
her
superior
intellect
she
was
also
bewitchingly
beautiful
i
waited
for
the
best
opportunity
and
came
near
to
her
as
she
was
about
to
spread
her
wings
for
a
morning
flight
from
the
beautiful
summit
near
her
summer
home
not
wishing
to
cause
her
undue
alarm
i
at
first
spoke
softly
remaining
invisible
and
watching
her
rare
eyes
send
their
glances
toward
the
palmy
trees
around
me
as
her
wings
were
relaxing
quietly
at
her
side
she
was
positive
of
having
heard
a
voice
and
as
she
still
further
scanned
the
immediate
surroundings
i
saw
that
perplexity
was
furrowing
marks
upon
her
face
illustration
beautiful
plume
on
the
world
of
swift
hast
thou
time
to
spend
with
a
friend
from
another
world
i
calmly
inquired
as
i
was
still
unseen
by
her
she
was
nervously
agitated
but
being
of
strong
fibre
she
quickly
rallied
with
her
answer
where
art
thou
and
who
art
thou
i
am
on
a
peace
mission
from
a
far
distant
world
i
quietly
said
as
i
slowly
became
visible
to
my
audience
of
one
naturally
she
was
alarmed
at
my
appearance
and
consequently
i
drew
gradually
farther
and
farther
away
until
she
gained
more
and
turned
interestingly
toward
me
ah
how
can
you
be
a
spirit
without
wings
were
her
first
unexpected
words
but
i
am
no
spirit
i
said
assuringly
you
can
not
be
otherwise
she
insisted
believe
what
you
wish
we
have
no
time
for
parley
i
am
delighted
to
visit
your
world
and
i
desire
if
possible
to
have
some
mysteries
solved
can
you
help
me
plume
for
that
is
the
name
i
called
her
was
much
unsettled
she
scanned
my
form
with
wild
curiosity
and
i
feared
that
she
would
at
once
use
her
wings
at
their
swiftest
pray
do
not
fly
hence
i
quickly
urged
i
will
never
harm
you
even
though
we
could
converse
together
forever
believe
me
true
and
rest
your
wings
and
heart
in
peace
my
words
had
some
effect
toward
calming
her
mind
and
with
more
placid
features
she
still
looked
at
me
half
shrinkingly
are
you
not
happy
that
you
have
wings
with
which
fly
i
continued
hoping
to
create
a
more
natural
familiarity
happy
no
more
than
for
my
feet
my
ears
or
my
life
she
answered
in
a
more
composed
manner
you
say
that
you
are
from
another
world
where
can
that
be
was
her
welcome
query
then
i
pointed
my
finger
in
the
direction
of
our
world
and
remarked
if
you
could
travel
in
that
direction
on
swift
wings
day
and
night
for
a
few
millions
of
years
you
would
still
be
far
far
away
from
the
world
where
i
live
and
is
that
world
inhabited
by
sensible
creatures
it
is
but
how
could
you
have
traversed
so
great
a
distance
never
can
i
explain
that
mystery
to
you
be
content
that
i
am
here
are
you
in
the
image
of
the
other
human
creatures
in
that
far
away
world
in
general
they
are
all
fashioned
as
i
am
no
one
having
wings
she
added
with
surprise
not
one
how
can
that
be
true
because
we
were
made
without
them
and
have
you
no
way
of
moving
through
the
air
at
pleasure
not
without
artificial
machinery
artificial
machinery
she
repeated
what
can
you
mean
by
that
of
course
they
have
no
word
for
balloon
or
flying
machine
and
i
found
it
difficult
to
describe
the
shape
and
explain
the
philosophy
of
these
things
i
did
the
best
i
could
in
her
language
and
after
i
had
finished
my
description
she
for
the
first
time
smiled
and
said
that
sort
of
a
construction
would
be
a
fine
thing
for
the
indolents
of
our
world
who
through
misuse
or
lack
of
use
of
their
wings
have
no
more
ability
to
fly
this
was
interesting
to
me
and
i
closely
inquired
as
to
the
cause
of
this
loss
of
the
wing
power
plume
grew
more
and
more
familiar
in
her
address
and
in
a
long
conversation
told
me
of
the
many
conditions
that
make
people
unfit
to
fly
i
deduce
from
our
conversation
a
few
of
these
causes
simple
neglect
gluttonous
life
sensuality
of
a
low
and
heavy
life
pride
some
yield
to
a
superstitious
notion
that
it
is
honorable
to
make
but
little
display
of
themselves
and
allow
their
wings
to
be
bound
or
partly
clipped
certain
kinds
of
sickness
render
the
inoperative
i
learned
that
altogether
nearly
of
the
population
are
unable
to
fly
how
my
mind
flew
back
to
our
own
life
as
i
was
learning
of
these
sad
conditions
there
is
a
sort
of
a
life
on
wings
in
our
world
although
the
wings
are
invisible
but
on
account
of
the
low
mean
lives
so
many
are
living
they
never
rise
above
the
miasmic
contagion
of
the
sin
and
self
level
these
unseen
wings
are
either
paralyzed
or
clipped
plume
now
actually
stepped
toward
me
what
a
graceful
tread
she
was
indeed
the
most
charming
creature
i
had
met
outside
of
my
own
world
she
seated
herself
near
me
on
the
rustic
bend
of
a
tree
unlike
any
in
our
world
and
hurried
her
questions
at
me
as
if
she
realized
that
i
would
not
tarry
long
at
length
she
gratefully
said
i
am
beginning
to
believe
that
you
are
really
a
son
of
another
world
or
else
i
am
reveling
in
a
day
dream
happy
am
i
that
i
can
learn
from
you
some
of
the
truths
after
which
i
am
seeking
was
my
evasive
reply
tell
me
plume
something
about
your
faith
religiously
i
worship
the
god
who
made
all
things
and
am
hoping
to
live
in
the
wider
life
after
my
mortal
days
are
ended
do
you
expect
to
meet
in
that
wider
life
representatives
from
other
worlds
ah
i
have
often
thought
that
it
might
be
so
she
answered
as
her
face
brightened
in
poetic
fervor
and
her
eyes
sparkled
with
seraphic
luster
it
shall
all
be
so
and
much
more
i
declared
in
that
life
you
can
fly
without
wings
and
mingle
with
the
pure
from
the
unnumbered
worlds
of
space
what
an
incentive
to
a
pure
life
she
quickly
added
talking
of
wings
do
you
object
if
i
see
more
closely
the
cut
and
style
of
your
wings
i
never
saw
before
a
human
creature
possessing
a
pair
after
a
moment
hesitancy
she
raised
her
right
arm
and
with
it
the
one
wing
unfolded
i
ventured
near
enough
to
see
the
intricate
network
of
muscle
and
bone
woven
around
the
arm
and
filling
the
space
between
the
raised
arm
and
the
side
of
plume
body
she
was
surprised
at
the
interest
i
manifested
in
the
human
wing
after
this
she
offered
to
furnish
an
able
escort
to
conduct
me
to
several
points
of
interest
all
this
i
declined
and
informed
my
talented
friend
that
i
must
hasten
away
to
another
world
let
me
go
with
you
she
strongly
insisted
your
wings
are
not
of
the
right
kind
i
replied
hurriedly
they
are
strong
enough
to
bear
us
both
were
her
inviting
words
but
not
beyond
the
atmosphere
of
this
world
i
explained
i
quietly
arose
scanned
once
more
the
beautiful
valley
before
me
and
indicated
that
i
was
about
to
wane
into
the
invisible
then
did
her
womanly
nature
assert
its
supremacy
and
she
for
the
first
time
touched
my
hand
imploringly
have
i
been
dreaming
or
do
my
eyes
deceive
me
how
can
all
this
be
true
your
hand
is
sensible
to
my
touch
i
implore
you
to
remain
until
i
speak
to
you
more
about
the
sciences
of
your
world
in
all
my
journey
i
never
yielded
to
persuasion
before
but
somehow
i
consented
to
spend
a
season
longer
of
most
charming
fellowship
talking
of
the
elements
in
nature
their
chemical
affinities
and
the
laws
of
matter
and
mind
plume
was
unusually
bright
in
the
philosophies
and
i
gathered
from
her
many
truths
which
had
always
before
been
hidden
to
me
finally
i
became
rigid
in
my
determination
to
leave
for
i
knew
that
i
could
not
stay
grant
me
one
request
she
begged
let
me
hear
it
promise
me
that
you
will
return
impossible
impossible
the
parting
that
followed
was
indeed
memorable
without
any
further
notice
i
suddenly
vanished
but
still
tarried
invisibly
in
close
proximity
plume
was
now
left
in
deep
bewilderment
and
i
could
not
even
conjecture
the
details
of
her
warring
thoughts
finally
i
saw
that
for
which
i
had
tarried
plume
lifted
her
wings
and
flew
skyward
as
beautifully
and
gracefully
as
any
bird
of
our
earthly
air
chapter
xxii
heaven
after
my
ambition
to
visit
one
thousand
worlds
had
been
realised
and
i
was
darting
toward
the
confines
of
our
own
little
solar
system
instinctively
i
looked
out
once
more
over
the
vast
stretches
of
space
all
around
me
at
amazing
distances
loomed
up
the
millions
of
spheres
which
i
had
not
visited
by
reason
of
my
limited
time
i
felt
like
some
one
who
after
gaining
his
first
thousand
dollars
has
a
wild
craving
to
accumulate
ten
or
one
hundred
thousand
more
still
i
scanned
the
heavens
while
deeper
longings
pervaded
my
soul
while
in
this
mood
the
most
unusual
vision
flashed
upon
my
eyes
suddenly
i
forgot
whither
i
was
going
and
in
wild
astonishment
i
drank
in
the
first
view
of
heaven
inwardly
i
marveled
that
i
had
not
seen
at
least
a
part
of
it
before
heaven
is
fashioned
on
a
transcendently
large
scale
it
is
not
a
single
sphere
but
a
universal
chain
of
vast
and
luminous
scattered
harmoniously
throughout
the
infinite
regions
of
space
so
that
a
part
of
it
lies
suspended
preciously
near
to
our
own
solar
system
heaven
is
more
real
and
substantial
than
the
suns
and
planets
of
the
universe
although
not
one
of
its
numberless
parts
can
be
detected
by
the
human
eye
or
discerned
through
a
telescope
these
luminous
orbs
that
constitute
heaven
control
the
movements
of
the
planets
suns
and
systems
which
we
call
material
they
are
whiter
than
snow
and
shine
with
a
luster
not
dazzling
but
restful
to
the
eye
capable
of
seeing
them
how
this
glimpse
put
to
naught
all
my
former
crude
conceptions
of
heaven
and
if
i
found
myself
unable
to
describe
the
wonders
of
many
a
dark
world
which
i
have
visited
how
much
less
could
i
portray
the
vastly
superior
beauties
of
heaven
which
are
so
far
beyond
the
glory
of
dark
rugged
worlds
that
i
felt
an
inexpressible
desire
to
take
up
my
abode
there
at
once
and
to
remain
forever
inwardly
i
shouted
for
joy
as
this
new
light
illumined
my
face
and
i
loathed
to
think
of
proceeding
on
my
journey
to
any
world
of
the
universe
for
the
ties
of
kinship
friendship
and
earthship
all
vanished
at
the
sight
of
such
resplendent
spheres
the
greatness
of
heaven
there
is
no
language
to
be
employed
that
can
fitly
describe
the
parts
of
heaven
i
saw
and
i
know
that
the
greater
glory
was
curtained
from
my
view
but
the
size
of
the
lustrous
orbs
is
not
equaled
by
the
large
material
suns
that
blaze
in
the
depth
of
immensity
heaven
diamond
splendor
extended
as
far
as
my
unassisted
eyes
could
reach
and
according
to
the
way
it
appeared
it
must
extend
without
limit
it
would
require
one
hundred
millions
of
years
for
a
child
of
god
to
take
one
excursion
trip
to
the
physical
worlds
of
our
universe
then
there
are
millions
of
such
universes
i
know
of
no
better
name
to
use
each
one
occupying
its
own
immense
stretches
of
space
these
universes
average
about
sixteen
hundred
millions
of
worlds
each
heaven
is
infinitely
greater
than
this
whole
material
fabric
so
that
if
a
spirit
is
inclined
to
travel
he
will
need
all
eternity
to
study
the
works
of
god
as
displayed
in
the
glorious
abodes
of
heaven
and
in
the
changing
aspects
of
created
worlds
let
us
give
a
deeper
meaning
to
the
stanza
of
the
poet
by
substituting
million
for
thousand
when
i
been
there
ten
million
years
bright
shining
as
the
sun
i
no
less
days
to
sing
god
praise
than
when
i
first
begun
compared
with
this
life
more
vast
does
it
not
appear
that
our
own
insignificant
existence
on
our
tiny
earth
is
as
the
creeping
of
a
mere
insect
on
the
leaf
of
a
giant
oak
permanency
of
heaven
the
only
permanent
or
imperishable
feature
of
our
universe
is
the
heaven
part
of
it
the
created
or
visible
worlds
are
mere
dark
appendages
of
the
real
spheres
and
are
serving
their
parts
in
bringing
fruit
to
their
maker
and
sinless
worlds
are
coming
to
an
end
continually
and
as
rapidly
are
new
ones
flung
out
or
old
ones
to
serve
as
garden
plots
to
bear
fruit
in
the
form
of
created
intelligences
who
serve
and
admire
god
through
choice
heaven
is
indestructible
it
has
already
been
in
existence
since
the
morning
of
time
in
all
my
journey
no
angel
or
mortal
could
tell
me
how
many
cycles
ago
that
was
but
it
must
be
said
that
heaven
does
not
always
present
the
same
aspect
mansions
are
built
for
the
reception
of
new
arrivals
or
for
the
vast
delegations
from
millennial
worlds
the
inhabitants
of
heaven
they
come
from
all
parts
of
the
universe
from
millions
of
spheres
the
righteous
of
any
world
at
death
are
suddenly
transported
to
that
part
of
heaven
lying
nearest
to
their
world
this
is
the
abraham
bosom
where
the
spirit
is
happy
until
it
takes
up
its
abode
with
its
own
spiritualized
body
in
a
millennial
reign
after
which
by
a
decree
of
the
final
judgment
it
is
given
its
credentials
to
the
illimitable
life
of
all
heaven
this
is
paul
third
heaven
oh
what
unlimited
expansion
what
incomprehensible
principles
to
move
at
large
in
quest
of
universal
truths
as
seen
in
the
seven
types
of
heaven
spiritual
intelligences
and
in
the
unending
manifestations
of
god
work
and
love
as
displayed
in
all
heaven
and
in
all
the
peopled
planets
of
space
not
one
of
these
blessed
inhabitants
ever
grows
old
or
suffers
fatigue
they
are
capable
of
moving
with
tireless
energy
from
one
part
of
heaven
vast
domains
to
any
other
portion
degrees
of
heaven
in
space
there
are
many
sinless
worlds
where
human
species
are
propagated
not
as
the
result
of
any
sexual
affinities
but
in
a
manner
totally
unintelligible
to
a
finite
mind
they
who
reach
heaven
from
such
a
world
can
not
drink
in
the
same
kind
of
enjoyment
as
those
who
come
up
out
of
great
tribulations
from
the
spheres
of
a
world
and
who
have
struggled
for
mastery
and
forged
their
way
to
the
sky
through
armies
of
aliens
but
these
creatures
are
perfectly
contented
for
they
have
no
way
of
realizing
the
glory
resulting
from
the
victory
over
the
world
the
flesh
and
the
devil
then
there
are
degrees
of
glory
among
those
who
come
from
a
world
some
have
many
treasures
laid
up
in
heaven
while
others
centered
their
affections
too
much
upon
the
transitory
things
of
time
and
sense
there
are
also
various
orders
or
degrees
of
glory
among
the
seven
types
of
intelligences
of
which
heaven
multitudes
are
composed
some
of
these
may
be
suggested
to
your
mind
when
you
read
more
of
this
sevenfold
life
illustration
a
glimpse
of
blissful
life
in
heaven
seven
types
of
intelligences
the
first
class
of
beings
is
composed
of
those
whom
we
comprehend
as
the
trinity
whose
highest
glory
is
expressed
in
the
mediatorial
personage
who
can
be
seen
at
will
by
any
of
heaven
hosts
from
any
world
the
cherubim
and
seraphim
or
the
highest
order
of
spirits
who
have
always
been
pure
and
holy
they
constitute
the
next
rank
of
the
celestial
host
the
third
class
is
composed
of
the
general
host
of
angels
who
also
have
been
holy
from
eternity
and
who
serve
as
ambassadors
to
various
points
of
the
limitless
creation
the
spirits
of
those
who
have
risen
from
sinful
worlds
by
virtue
of
a
and
mediator
to
join
the
ranks
of
this
class
we
who
serve
god
are
hastening
this
is
no
low
order
or
caste
in
heaven
but
they
who
belong
to
it
vie
with
higher
angels
and
taste
sweetness
beyond
the
capacity
of
those
who
in
other
respects
are
our
peers
the
angels
desire
to
look
into
the
deep
mystery
of
plan
the
matured
and
maturing
spirits
of
those
who
left
sinful
worlds
before
god
held
them
accountable
for
their
deeds
to
this
class
belong
our
children
who
precede
us
into
the
final
abode
the
spirits
of
those
who
have
risen
from
sinless
worlds
to
take
their
infinitely
higher
degrees
in
this
heaven
life
the
matured
and
maturing
spirits
of
those
who
left
the
sinless
worlds
before
sense
perception
was
duly
developed
they
form
a
distinct
class
of
spirits
and
have
their
distinctive
marks
unity
of
heaven
redemption
plan
for
each
sinful
world
is
somewhat
similar
to
ours
so
that
there
is
a
oneness
in
the
whole
family
of
the
redeemed
this
is
one
main
factor
that
makes
the
bond
of
unity
perfect
and
renders
the
fellowship
of
the
celestial
hosts
absolutely
without
a
flaw
true
enough
each
of
the
seven
classes
of
intelligences
is
a
mystery
and
a
glory
to
the
others
but
there
is
no
friction
no
jar
each
one
is
perfect
in
himself
and
happy
in
spirit
although
each
one
of
the
vast
companies
carries
the
distinctive
impress
and
the
spiritual
peculiarities
of
his
own
planet
yet
they
are
all
now
fashioned
after
the
symmetry
of
the
heaven
life
and
no
one
bears
a
single
repellant
feature
but
rather
each
spiritual
body
is
beautiful
to
the
eyes
of
all
the
others
and
each
one
breathes
the
same
atmosphere
of
purity
and
converses
in
the
language
of
love
a
place
no
feature
of
heaven
is
more
beautiful
than
its
atmosphere
the
soul
is
not
chilled
by
the
cities
or
by
the
long
long
stretches
of
divine
masonry
god
is
as
a
real
father
and
all
his
subjects
are
as
our
we
feel
it
and
the
inspiration
of
these
truths
takes
a
deep
hold
of
heaven
vast
populace
employment
now
and
then
large
excursion
parties
visit
various
points
of
our
own
universe
and
frequently
span
the
incredible
distances
in
order
to
study
the
works
and
life
of
other
universes
each
soul
is
occupied
in
gratifying
its
own
master
passion
and
lives
in
the
delightsome
fellowship
of
the
saints
transportation
there
are
no
vehicles
or
cars
of
any
kind
actual
wings
are
unknown
except
as
used
by
certain
birds
of
heaven
spirits
travel
as
rapidly
as
desired
by
a
mere
submissive
connection
with
the
universal
system
of
power
filaments
all
of
which
center
in
god
more
refined
power
than
electricity
is
transmitted
over
these
substantial
filaments
to
any
point
of
any
world
the
fleshly
body
is
not
sensitive
to
this
spiritual
power
but
the
pure
soul
when
free
from
the
body
is
at
once
sensitive
to
these
chords
of
power
and
is
carried
swifter
than
a
current
of
electricity
to
abraham
bosom
where
it
is
entitled
forever
to
a
free
use
of
this
perfect
power
without
being
subject
to
any
kind
of
taxation
sexual
affinities
of
heaven
contrary
to
some
of
my
former
ideas
i
saw
that
the
inhabitants
of
heaven
are
not
all
of
one
sex
the
male
and
female
are
clearly
distinguishable
and
they
bear
relations
one
to
another
still
more
refined
than
was
manifest
in
the
millennial
world
the
most
holy
affinity
exists
between
the
several
types
of
intelligences
here
the
glorious
fires
of
love
burn
never
to
reach
a
climax
lovers
have
been
drinking
from
perennial
fountains
for
a
million
years
and
their
ecstacies
are
rising
still
pure
love
is
as
endless
and
infinite
as
time
and
space
and
its
mystery
is
deep
to
these
shining
throngs
of
heaven
who
look
into
one
another
faces
with
untrammeled
emotions
think
of
falling
in
love
with
the
inhabitants
of
other
worlds
and
of
having
the
capacity
and
right
to
foster
a
thousand
or
more
types
of
affinity
each
one
differing
from
the
others
these
relations
are
so
highly
refined
and
so
gloriously
developed
that
one
must
not
think
of
reducing
them
by
comparison
to
the
level
of
the
flesh
life
structural
aspects
of
heaven
i
would
not
attempt
to
describe
the
structural
glory
of
heaven
for
i
know
not
where
nor
how
to
begin
seemingly
all
things
are
transparent
even
to
the
center
of
vast
orbs
magnificent
cities
apparently
lie
suspended
far
under
the
indefinite
surface
of
the
orbs
composing
heaven
and
free
passage
ways
of
phantastical
design
ramify
throughout
all
the
glorious
regions
architectural
greatness
here
finds
its
unmatched
examples
diamond
arches
are
and
towers
of
two
thousand
miles
in
height
and
one
thousand
miles
in
diameter
as
the
corner
stone
of
a
city
are
nothing
unusual
although
many
cities
are
built
on
a
smaller
plan
nothing
needs
repairing
and
nothing
is
mortgaged
the
wealth
of
unnumbered
trillions
is
easily
represented
in
one
orb
of
empire
i
now
saw
a
more
clearly
than
ever
before
the
absolute
folly
of
fixing
our
affections
on
the
perishing
things
of
the
mortal
life
in
our
dark
and
dusty
world
while
my
eyes
were
still
feasting
on
the
sublime
picture
before
me
i
began
to
realize
that
my
privilege
would
be
of
short
duration
as
the
vision
was
fast
waning
i
looked
intently
until
the
last
curtain
fell
and
reluctantly
i
continued
my
journey
toward
my
own
little
world
i
now
felt
that
if
the
whole
earth
were
my
own
property
i
would
gladly
push
it
all
aside
if
i
could
be
a
mere
door
keeper
in
one
of
the
heavenly
cities
of
my
god
and
very
often
since
that
time
i
have
cast
my
longing
eyes
skyward
hoping
to
catch
another
glimpse
of
that
fair
scene
how
i
long
for
that
restful
picture
a
vision
of
heaven
once
more
with
its
trillion
orbs
of
beauty
and
its
wealth
of
endless
store
there
are
saints
from
unnumbered
planets
where
they
lived
in
a
million
ways
now
they
mingle
in
perfect
glory
through
the
length
of
eternal
days
there
the
poor
are
wealthy
forever
for
the
beggar
sits
down
with
the
king
the
man
who
never
knew
music
will
vie
with
angels
to
sing
here
the
hopeful
student
progressing
after
failing
does
often
grieve
but
in
heaven
each
lesson
is
perfect
no
theory
to
blind
or
deceive
here
the
runner
in
breathless
struggle
sees
the
other
in
touch
of
the
goal
but
heaven
gives
each
one
the
laurel
to
be
crowned
while
the
ages
roll
there
they
have
no
light
of
a
candle
for
there
are
no
shadows
of
night
there
the
flash
of
unnumbered
opals
sparkles
on
in
their
wealth
of
light
in
that
palace
of
heaven
where
these
myriad
trillions
are
there
the
lord
is
the
master
and
love
is
the
star
